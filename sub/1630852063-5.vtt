00:01.360 --> 00:03.960
(gentle music)

00:07.440 --> 00:10.040
(theme music)

00:25.681 --> 00:28.841
(audience applauding)

00:36.241 --> 00:38.381
- Thank you, thank you,
thank you.

00:38.481 --> 00:41.061
Hello, welcome to Top Gear.

00:41.161 --> 00:43.661
Where we have some sad
news, because tonight

00:43.761 --> 00:46.541
is the last show of the series, everyone!

00:46.641 --> 00:47.742
(audience groaning)
- Oh, no.

00:47.842 --> 00:50.582
But we also have some
good news, because tonight

00:50.682 --> 00:52.902
we are on a public service mission.

00:53.002 --> 00:55.342
We're gonna be fighting
injustice and tackling

00:55.442 --> 00:58.622
one of the biggest disgraces
in modern motoring.

00:58.722 --> 01:01.302
- And that's the sheer
expense of being a new driver.

01:01.402 --> 01:03.342
What young people have
to fork out nowadays

01:03.442 --> 01:04.622
just to be on the road.

01:04.722 --> 01:05.862
It's a disgrace, Pad.

01:05.962 --> 01:07.062
- Scandalous.

01:07.162 --> 01:08.662
- See, according to recent research,

01:08.762 --> 01:11.102
new drivers have to shell out, on average,

01:11.202 --> 01:13.463
close to 5000 pounds on their first car,

01:13.563 --> 01:16.383
plus another 1900 quid on insurance.

01:16.483 --> 01:19.343
That's nearly seven grand
straight off the bat, Fred.

01:19.443 --> 01:20.663
- For your seven grand,
you'll probably get

01:20.763 --> 01:21.703
something like this.

01:21.803 --> 01:23.543
A Corsa with a few miles on the clock.

01:23.643 --> 01:25.063
- Yeah.
- Now it's fine.

01:25.163 --> 01:26.863
It's a bit Vauxhall Corsa, innit.

01:26.963 --> 01:28.903
- It is very Vauxhall Corsa, it is.

01:29.003 --> 01:31.703
But don't worry though,
because for that sort of money,

01:31.803 --> 01:33.783
there are some far
better options out there,

01:33.883 --> 01:35.884
as we shall now demonstrate.

01:36.964 --> 01:39.524
(upbeat music)

01:42.684 --> 01:44.424
Cars for new drivers?

01:44.524 --> 01:46.624
Head to Plymouth, they said.

01:46.724 --> 01:50.724
Recently declared the UK's
top city for young adults.

01:56.564 --> 02:00.105
(distorted music)

02:00.205 --> 02:02.665
All right, on this particular Friday,

02:02.765 --> 02:05.985
it was also the UK's windiest city.

02:06.085 --> 02:08.985
But no matter, because the big news is

02:09.085 --> 02:12.425
that with a seven grand
budget for car and insurance,

02:12.525 --> 02:15.765
you can have something a bit special.

02:19.925 --> 02:21.925
Ah.

02:22.765 --> 02:25.146
The MG B GT.

02:25.246 --> 02:26.266
Oh yes.

02:26.366 --> 02:30.426
I have gone classic, and
what a classic this is.

02:30.526 --> 02:34.466
5000 pounds to buy, and if I
was a young 17-year-old Paddy

02:34.566 --> 02:37.706
from Bolton, it'd 1300 quid to insure.

02:37.806 --> 02:39.906
(upbeat music)

02:40.006 --> 02:43.346
All in all, that's 6300 pounds

02:43.446 --> 02:45.626
for a great British sports car

02:45.726 --> 02:48.367
that's dripping with 60s style.

02:49.767 --> 02:53.067
And with a 1.8 litre four-cylinder engine,

02:53.167 --> 02:56.527
plus rear wheel drive, it is genius.

02:58.167 --> 03:00.347
I mean, there was even enough left over

03:00.447 --> 03:02.487
to give it a trendy lick of paint.

03:04.647 --> 03:07.387
And while I'm giving you the
McGuinness money saving tips,

03:07.487 --> 03:10.747
this car is over 40 years old,

03:10.847 --> 03:15.108
which means it's officially
classed as an historic vehicle,

03:15.208 --> 03:19.048
which means it's exempt
from road tax and MOT.

03:20.568 --> 03:22.708
I'm like a sexy Martin Lewis.

03:22.808 --> 03:23.668
(horn honking)

03:23.768 --> 03:24.628
Oh!

03:24.728 --> 03:27.168
(rock music)

03:29.128 --> 03:31.128
The love bug!

03:36.129 --> 03:38.509
- Oh, oh, nearly lost me door!

03:38.609 --> 03:40.649
- I've picked the wrong day
to roll me sleeves up!

03:42.649 --> 03:45.389
- It's not a day for hair neither, is it?

03:45.489 --> 03:47.909
- See, this is where I've
top-trumped you today.

03:48.009 --> 03:49.949
- This is when bald's in your favour.

03:50.049 --> 03:50.789
- Love it.

03:50.889 --> 03:52.229
Go on, give us the numbers.

03:52.329 --> 03:53.989
- It's obviously a Beetle.
- Yeah.

03:54.089 --> 03:58.509
- Cost me five grand, and a
17-year-old Fred from Preston,

03:58.609 --> 04:00.750
870 quid to insure, but there's more,

04:00.850 --> 04:02.510
don't start, there's more, there's more.

04:02.610 --> 04:07.070
'Cause it's over 40 years
old, no tax, no MOT.

04:07.170 --> 04:07.910
- Yeah.

04:08.010 --> 04:09.550
I've already told 'em that.

04:09.650 --> 04:12.350
That's cheaper than most
of these modern city cars.

04:12.450 --> 04:13.550
(rock music)

04:13.650 --> 04:14.550
- [Freddie] Oh, yes.

04:14.650 --> 04:19.510
For just 5800-odd quid,
you could get the original

04:19.610 --> 04:23.711
air-cooled four-cylinder
icon whose timeless looks

04:23.811 --> 04:25.811
just get better with age.

04:28.291 --> 04:29.511
- It's an absolute beauty.

04:29.611 --> 04:31.111
- I love it in white as well.

04:31.211 --> 04:32.951
- And people from our era.
(horn honking)

04:33.051 --> 04:33.751
Herbie.

04:33.851 --> 04:35.711
- Oh, what? Oh.
- What's this?

04:35.811 --> 04:37.791
(regal music)

04:37.891 --> 04:40.111
- Has he left an SUV in the wash?

04:40.211 --> 04:43.151
- Oh, I don't know, Paddy,
I think he's done it again.

04:43.251 --> 04:45.031
That's a Lada.

04:45.131 --> 04:46.912
- Lads.

04:47.012 --> 04:48.832
I'm excited!

04:48.932 --> 04:53.352
The Lada Niva, the Soviet
four-by-four legend.

04:53.452 --> 04:54.672
Look at it!

04:54.772 --> 04:55.752
- I like it when you're smiling.

04:55.852 --> 04:57.752
- Under five and a half grand to buy.

04:57.852 --> 04:59.032
- What?
- Okay?

04:59.132 --> 05:02.272
Under a grand to insure
for the 17-year-old me.

05:02.372 --> 05:04.152
Why would you want a Corsa
when you can have this?

05:04.252 --> 05:05.752
Look at it.

05:05.852 --> 05:06.592
(upbeat music)

05:06.692 --> 05:08.712
Forget the Land Rover Defender.

05:08.812 --> 05:11.273
This pint-sized hero
of the off-road world

05:11.373 --> 05:15.993
has been in production longer
than any other four-by-four.

05:16.093 --> 05:18.473
And for just six and a half grand all-in,

05:18.573 --> 05:21.493
it is a total bargain.

05:22.413 --> 05:24.073
- Oh, I want to hammer ya.

05:24.173 --> 05:24.953
(Chris laughing)

05:25.053 --> 05:26.473
But no, I love it.

05:26.573 --> 05:27.273
I love it.

05:27.373 --> 05:30.913
- I think this is the first
time we're all kind of like,

05:31.013 --> 05:33.473
happy with these three motors.

05:33.573 --> 05:34.754
- Oh, one more thing.
- Go on.

05:34.854 --> 05:37.634
- Because it's 40 years old.
- Yeah.

05:37.734 --> 05:39.914
- Don't need an MOT,
don't have to pay for tax.

05:40.014 --> 05:40.794
- Yeah.

05:40.894 --> 05:44.394
He said that, I have, three
times they've heard that.

05:44.494 --> 05:46.514
It's a good money-saving tip.

05:46.614 --> 05:49.714
- Now, most importantly, that
looks like a factory colour,

05:49.814 --> 05:50.954
a factory off-white.

05:51.054 --> 05:53.354
I can imagine that in period.

05:53.454 --> 05:55.394
Is that a factory colour?
What colour is that.

05:55.494 --> 05:57.194
- Oh, this is like, you know like,

05:57.294 --> 05:59.395
the fancy Audi and the Porsche colours?
- Yeah.

05:59.495 --> 06:01.915
- I think they call it putty grey.

06:02.015 --> 06:02.775
- What colour was it originally?

06:02.855 --> 06:05.515
- Well, it was British racing green.

06:05.615 --> 06:06.955
- Oh, so you painted over BRG for that?

06:07.055 --> 06:10.395
- Please, please, please.
- A classic.

06:10.495 --> 06:11.555
- What colour's that?

06:11.655 --> 06:12.595
Berocca wee?

06:12.695 --> 06:13.595
(Freddie laughing)

06:13.695 --> 06:16.635
- If I were doing it for
you, I'd do it burgundy red.

06:16.735 --> 06:17.715
But we're appealing...

06:17.815 --> 06:21.395
Look, we could have argued
about the colour all day.

06:21.495 --> 06:25.436
The point is, when it comes
to choosing your first car,

06:25.536 --> 06:29.856
this little trio makes for one
hell of a menu to pick from.

06:31.096 --> 06:33.096
- Oh, I do love the Beetle.

06:33.696 --> 06:35.276
Just driving it for the first time,

06:35.376 --> 06:37.776
it's everything I thought it would be.
It's lovely.

06:40.256 --> 06:41.876
- I make no secret of the fact that I've

06:41.976 --> 06:44.876
always wanted a Niva, always.

06:44.976 --> 06:46.477
It's joyous!

06:46.577 --> 06:48.917
- It was actually known as
the poor man's Aston Martin,

06:49.017 --> 06:49.837
this, when it came out.

06:49.937 --> 06:52.457
No one's calling the Corsa
a poor man's Aston Martin.

06:53.617 --> 06:57.037
Have you got an MG in
the collection, Chris?

06:57.137 --> 06:58.477
- I don't, but looking at
yours, there's something

06:58.577 --> 07:01.137
about the shape, that
hatchback shape, that I love.

07:02.297 --> 07:04.477
- What about a Beetle,
Chris, you got a Beetle?

07:04.577 --> 07:05.557
- No, don't have a Beetle.

07:05.657 --> 07:07.557
You're either a Mini man or a Beetle man

07:07.657 --> 07:09.677
when I was young, and I was a Mini man.

07:09.777 --> 07:10.958
- You still are.

07:11.058 --> 07:13.398
(Freddie laughing)

07:13.498 --> 07:15.478
(rock music)

07:15.578 --> 07:18.438
- Now, we might've been
happy with our motors,

07:18.538 --> 07:20.798
but the producers weren't convinced.

07:20.898 --> 07:23.878
So to prove their first car credentials,

07:23.978 --> 07:27.838
we'd be taking them on a tour
through Devon and Cornwall,

07:27.938 --> 07:30.298
starting with Dartmoor.

07:32.138 --> 07:34.499
- [Chris] What do you
see a lot of on Dartmoor?

07:36.499 --> 07:37.959
- Is it...

07:38.059 --> 07:39.279
What are they called?

07:39.379 --> 07:40.559
Panthers?

07:40.659 --> 07:42.639
- Did you say "Panthers," Paddy?

07:42.739 --> 07:43.839
Panthers?

07:43.939 --> 07:46.279
- Yeah, there's one roaming
round it, isn't there?

07:46.379 --> 07:49.279
Didn't I read sommat, the
beast of Dartmoor or sommat?

07:49.379 --> 07:51.939
- It's the beast of Bobmin, you big berk.

07:52.859 --> 07:55.259
(rock music)

07:56.939 --> 07:59.960
- So, you've just passed your driving test

08:00.060 --> 08:00.800
and you're buzzing.

08:00.900 --> 08:01.840
What do you get?

08:01.940 --> 08:03.940
Well, you want something speedy.

08:04.860 --> 08:06.880
Something sporty.

08:06.980 --> 08:09.780
Something to really
show off to your mates.

08:11.060 --> 08:13.320
Sadly, you can't afford to get insured

08:13.420 --> 08:16.460
on anything like that, unless you go old.

08:20.260 --> 08:25.361
The MGB was launched in
1962, and soon became

08:25.461 --> 08:27.761
one of Britain's favourite sports cars.

08:27.861 --> 08:32.361
Half a million they built,
and it's easy to see why.

08:32.461 --> 08:35.121
So for your first taste of driving,

08:35.221 --> 08:37.381
honestly, why wouldn't you?

08:39.581 --> 08:42.761
It's light, it's nimble,
it's rear-wheel drive.

08:42.861 --> 08:45.802
It ticks all the boxes, and this car

08:45.902 --> 08:47.922
actually forces you to drive.

08:48.022 --> 08:49.682
I mean, look, look at that.

08:49.782 --> 08:52.402
You've got to wind the
window down on this thing,

08:52.502 --> 08:53.642
you've gotta drive it.

08:53.742 --> 08:57.162
If the head gasket goes,
you've gotta change it.

08:57.262 --> 08:59.802
It's a learning curve, this car.

08:59.902 --> 09:02.502
(upbeat music)

09:05.702 --> 09:08.762
- One of me neighbours used
to have a Beetle as a kid.

09:08.862 --> 09:11.363
Liz Smith lived across the
road with her six kids.

09:11.463 --> 09:12.563
Her running around with one of these.

09:12.663 --> 09:13.763
I remember being in it one day.

09:13.863 --> 09:15.403
It was a real novelty.

09:15.503 --> 09:16.723
It was lovely.

09:16.823 --> 09:18.823
But one thing which I learned,

09:19.263 --> 09:22.123
other Beetle drivers, they
all wave at each other.

09:22.223 --> 09:24.323
You'd be driving down
the road and have a pomp,

09:24.423 --> 09:26.003
flash of their lights, or a wave.

09:26.103 --> 09:28.183
You're part of something.

09:31.103 --> 09:34.764
The Beetle was built for over 60 years

09:34.864 --> 09:36.864
in every corner of the world.

09:37.824 --> 09:39.644
And if you want to talk numbers,

09:39.744 --> 09:43.404
they made 20 million of 'em.

09:43.504 --> 09:47.284
Every single one offering
that same affordable,

09:47.384 --> 09:50.184
economical, cheap-to-run recipe.

09:51.744 --> 09:54.484
So if you buy one of these,
you're not just buying

09:54.584 --> 09:58.725
your first car, you're
buying a piece of history.

09:58.825 --> 10:01.365
And the thing that makes
these perfect for new drivers

10:01.465 --> 10:05.605
is they're really slow,
peaceful, you just slow down.

10:05.705 --> 10:07.705
Where's the downside?

10:09.065 --> 10:11.045
Probably the windscreen
wipers at this point.

10:11.145 --> 10:14.865
And a windscreen that I've
just gotta keep wiping.

10:16.745 --> 10:18.525
But I'm smiling.

10:18.625 --> 10:20.625
I really am smiling.

10:21.866 --> 10:23.246
(dramatic music)

10:23.346 --> 10:25.166
- Maybe.

10:25.266 --> 10:27.926
But not as much as I was.

10:28.026 --> 10:30.426
What a cool, cool vehicle.

10:31.986 --> 10:35.026
I have so clearly got the
coolest car of the three.

10:35.946 --> 10:37.946
This is...

10:38.346 --> 10:41.466
My 17-year-old dream.

10:46.547 --> 10:48.847
The Lada Niva is the exception to the rule

10:48.947 --> 10:52.407
that all Soviet era cars were terrible.

10:52.507 --> 10:54.487
Designed as a workhorse for the villagers

10:54.587 --> 10:58.167
and farmers of rural Russia,
it was built to operate

10:58.267 --> 11:01.067
in some of the toughest
conditions on the planet.

11:02.227 --> 11:05.127
And as a result, it
has endured like almost

11:05.227 --> 11:07.227
no other car in history.

11:09.788 --> 11:11.848
Nivas have been everywhere.

11:11.948 --> 11:15.408
North Pole, South Pole, Everest base camp.

11:15.508 --> 11:17.368
They are indestructible.

11:17.468 --> 11:21.048
It's simple, it's practical, it's tough.

11:21.148 --> 11:21.888
I love it.

11:21.988 --> 11:24.268
I absolutely love it,
it's a hero car of mine.

11:27.828 --> 11:30.568
(rock music)

11:30.668 --> 11:32.288
But before we get too carried away

11:32.388 --> 11:35.489
with the whole old car
for new driver pitch,

11:35.589 --> 11:37.869
there are a couple of
things you need to know.

11:39.109 --> 11:42.009
First, insurance.

11:42.109 --> 11:43.849
Now we've rang round
the insurance companies

11:43.949 --> 11:45.529
trying to get the best quote.

11:45.629 --> 11:47.089
You can ring one day,
it'll be a decent quote,

11:47.189 --> 11:49.989
ring back the next day,
it'll totally change.

11:51.109 --> 11:54.129
- And the other thing is, it
all depends on where you live, too.

11:54.229 --> 11:57.650
So if you live in London,
you're paying a premium,

11:57.750 --> 11:59.330
which you should be used to, you pay

11:59.430 --> 12:02.090
a premium on your houses,
you pay a premium on drinks,

12:02.190 --> 12:03.810
food, everything down south.

12:03.910 --> 12:05.250
- But if you go with a classic car,

12:05.350 --> 12:07.610
there's some really
competitive quotes out there.

12:07.710 --> 12:11.450
Now, I say competitive,
providing you're not

12:11.550 --> 12:14.630
going for something
fast, expensive, or rare,

12:15.710 --> 12:17.090
you should be okay.

12:17.190 --> 12:20.410
- So basically, what we're
saying is buy something

12:20.510 --> 12:23.411
slow, cheap, and readily available.

12:23.511 --> 12:25.291
And move yourself to Preston.

12:25.391 --> 12:29.151
You will save yourself a
packet on car insurance.

12:30.831 --> 12:33.551
- And then there's the
whole 40-year-old car thing.

12:34.391 --> 12:36.731
Just 'cause it doesn't need an MOT,

12:36.831 --> 12:38.771
you don't have to tax it, you still need

12:38.871 --> 12:39.931
to keep it roadworthy.

12:40.031 --> 12:42.771
No bald tires, look after it.

12:42.871 --> 12:45.052
And remember, it's an old thing.

12:45.152 --> 12:47.472
Take some pride, cherish it.

12:48.552 --> 12:49.812
One note of caution, though, just before

12:49.912 --> 12:52.372
you go out and buy, oh, hello.

12:52.472 --> 12:55.052
- I'm freewheeling here,
me engine's cut out.

12:55.152 --> 12:57.152
- Unbelievable.

12:58.952 --> 13:00.952
- Come on.

13:01.392 --> 13:03.512
Just having a couple of
technicals with the Beetle.

13:05.232 --> 13:05.972
- Go on, Fred.

13:06.072 --> 13:07.892
Go on, Beetle.

13:07.992 --> 13:09.093
- It's gone.

13:09.193 --> 13:10.573
Oh, you f...
- No, he's died.

13:10.673 --> 13:12.453
He's died.

13:12.553 --> 13:14.493
- Now, I know what you're thinking,

13:14.593 --> 13:18.513
and no, you don't want your
first car breaking down on you.

13:19.713 --> 13:20.413
- Of all the days.

13:20.513 --> 13:23.933
I don't need to be pushing
this car around Cornwall.

13:24.033 --> 13:26.133
- [Paddy] But this isn't a breakdown.

13:26.233 --> 13:31.153
This is just a VW Beetle giving
its new owner some exercise.

13:33.954 --> 13:36.754
After all these cars are over 40.

13:39.114 --> 13:39.814
- [Freddie] Oh, hang on.

13:39.914 --> 13:41.014
It's just gone a bit back.

13:41.114 --> 13:43.554
- [Paddy] Everyone over 40's the same.

13:45.274 --> 13:46.574
- We're back on.

13:46.674 --> 13:48.674
Think it just needed
a rest, the old girl.

13:51.314 --> 13:53.754
We all need a rest at 40-odd, don't we?

13:55.274 --> 13:56.415
Go on, the Beetle.

13:56.515 --> 13:57.735
We're moving again.

13:57.835 --> 13:59.575
- [Paddy] Good work, boys.

13:59.675 --> 14:02.015
- [Chris] Now, for some
reason, the producers

14:02.115 --> 14:04.215
couldn't yet see the brilliance of our

14:04.315 --> 14:06.315
old car, new driver theory.

14:07.435 --> 14:09.215
- Oh, oh, oh, oh god.

14:09.315 --> 14:12.895
- [Chris] And in a shameless
bid to disprove it further,

14:12.995 --> 14:16.675
they soon told us to pull
off the road for a test.

14:17.635 --> 14:20.155
(tense music)

14:22.236 --> 14:25.216
- [Paddy] What the hell's this place?

14:25.316 --> 14:27.016
- [Chris] Quarry.

14:27.116 --> 14:29.096
- Yours'll be at home
here, Chris, won't it?

14:29.196 --> 14:31.196
- This is Niva country.

14:32.196 --> 14:32.956
- [Freddie] It's like you've got

14:33.036 --> 14:34.376
a cloaking device round here, Paddy.

14:34.476 --> 14:36.476
Look at ya.

14:37.356 --> 14:39.016
- [Paddy] Oh, lads.

14:39.116 --> 14:41.916
I spy a Corsa.

14:43.276 --> 14:45.277
Hang on, it's being driven by the Stig.

14:47.957 --> 14:49.957
- What's he doing?

14:50.317 --> 14:52.317
- Who knows with him?

14:54.237 --> 14:54.977
- He's out of the car.

14:55.077 --> 14:55.857
He's out the car.

14:55.957 --> 14:57.417
He's walking off.

14:57.517 --> 14:59.657
- Someone approaching
my window in high vis.

14:59.757 --> 15:01.857
Thank you very much, boss.
- No problem.

15:01.957 --> 15:03.657
- Unsurprisingly, it's a challenge.

15:03.757 --> 15:06.177
Having spent so much on their first car,

15:06.277 --> 15:07.817
the next challenge facing new drivers

15:07.917 --> 15:09.378
is getting as far as they can

15:09.478 --> 15:11.618
on what little fuel they can afford.

15:11.718 --> 15:13.978
On one pound of petrol,
the Stig has just driven

15:14.078 --> 15:17.378
a Vauxhall Corsa flat-out
until it ran out.

15:17.478 --> 15:21.458
He managed 11 laps in six
minutes and 14 seconds.

15:21.558 --> 15:23.098
You will now have the same amount of fuel

15:23.198 --> 15:27.858
to see how far your cars
can go in the same time.

15:27.958 --> 15:29.898
- Oh.

15:29.998 --> 15:31.418
How many laps did he do?

15:31.518 --> 15:32.659
- 11.

15:32.759 --> 15:34.499
- I'd take three at this point.

15:34.599 --> 15:35.899
(light music)

15:35.999 --> 15:38.739
- To see which of our
classics was best suited

15:38.839 --> 15:42.059
to a new driver's frugal lifestyle,

15:42.159 --> 15:44.219
with our tanks drained and filled back up

15:44.319 --> 15:47.019
with just one quid's worth of fuel,

15:47.119 --> 15:50.259
we would now take turns
seeing how far we could go

15:50.359 --> 15:53.899
within the six minutes,
14 seconds set by the Stig

15:53.999 --> 15:56.600
in the UK's most popular first car.

15:58.600 --> 16:00.900
Do you know what, actually, this challenge

16:01.000 --> 16:03.580
is right up my street, because
when we were all younger

16:03.680 --> 16:05.540
in Bolton and we got our first cars,

16:05.640 --> 16:07.980
that's what we put in
it, a pound of juice.

16:08.080 --> 16:10.340
And it kind of ran for awhile.

16:10.440 --> 16:14.020
- I remember me brother, his
first car was a Fiesta Mark II.

16:14.120 --> 16:16.120
Just on the one litre engine.

16:16.680 --> 16:18.300
And he used to put two pound in at a time.

16:18.400 --> 16:19.300
He used to go forever.

16:19.400 --> 16:20.221
(Paddy laughs)

16:20.321 --> 16:22.061
(upbeat music)

16:22.161 --> 16:24.981
- Oh yes, it was time to summon up

16:25.081 --> 16:27.901
all those penny-pinching
years of experience

16:28.001 --> 16:31.481
as Flintoff and his Beetle lined up first.

16:33.601 --> 16:34.581
- Here we go, Fred.

16:34.681 --> 16:36.581
Three, two, one, go.

16:36.681 --> 16:38.381
(upbeat music)

16:38.481 --> 16:39.221
- Come on.

16:39.321 --> 16:40.741
Have to open the window, I'm steaming up.

16:40.841 --> 16:42.941
Windscreen wipers on.

16:43.041 --> 16:45.922
I've gotta say that this
doesn't really feel right.

16:46.882 --> 16:48.902
- Chris, I'm not sure if he's got

16:49.002 --> 16:51.222
his foot down in that or not.

16:51.322 --> 16:52.662
- Can't find gears.

16:52.762 --> 16:54.942
Get round.

16:55.042 --> 16:58.882
Now look, we all know speed
is not the Beetle's forte.

17:00.002 --> 17:01.062
- Have you got your foot down there, Fred?

17:01.162 --> 17:02.902
Or what's the tactic?

17:03.002 --> 17:05.422
- I have me foot on the floor there, lads.

17:05.522 --> 17:08.303
(Paddy laughs)

17:08.403 --> 17:11.543
- No one was expecting
it to beat the Corsa.

17:11.643 --> 17:12.703
Wrestling it round.

17:12.803 --> 17:15.423
- He is crawling round.

17:15.523 --> 17:17.523
- Can't see.

17:17.883 --> 17:19.743
- [Paddy] And while it did somehow manage

17:19.843 --> 17:22.823
to put in 10 valiant laps...

17:22.923 --> 17:24.463
- Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

17:24.563 --> 17:26.503
- She's dying, she's dying.

17:26.603 --> 17:29.743
- In the end, it didn't disappoint.

17:29.843 --> 17:31.844
She's starting to go, boys.

17:35.284 --> 17:37.184
I've gone.

17:37.284 --> 17:40.044
(Chris laughing)

17:44.444 --> 17:45.944
- [Paddy] Look at Fred,
straight out in puddle.

17:46.044 --> 17:48.044
No messing.

17:48.764 --> 17:50.344
- Got wet feet now.

17:50.444 --> 17:51.504
- Look at him!

17:51.604 --> 17:53.604
He's out of his mind!

17:54.364 --> 17:58.065
As Flintoff got stuck into
his second workout of the day,

17:58.165 --> 18:01.705
amazingly, his Beetle
had lost out to the Corsa

18:01.805 --> 18:03.805
by just one lap.

18:04.725 --> 18:07.825
But our classics were
still in with a shot,

18:07.925 --> 18:12.545
because next to have a crack
was the expert car journalist

18:12.645 --> 18:14.645
and his legendary Niva.

18:16.085 --> 18:17.145
- He's gonna have a theory, isn't he?

18:17.245 --> 18:18.385
He's gonna have a theory, this lad.

18:18.485 --> 18:21.966
- He'll have worked out
the times, the cornering.

18:22.926 --> 18:24.266
- Don't hold me on the line, McGuinness.

18:24.366 --> 18:25.386
(Freddie laughs)

18:25.486 --> 18:26.706
- Here we go.

18:26.806 --> 18:27.746
(tense music)

18:27.846 --> 18:29.846
Three.

18:30.206 --> 18:31.786
Two.

18:31.886 --> 18:32.666
- Come on!

18:32.766 --> 18:33.626
- One.

18:33.726 --> 18:35.726
Go!

18:36.286 --> 18:40.586
- [Freddie] Now it turns out
Harris did have a theory.

18:40.686 --> 18:44.467
- Go nice and slowly.
- Strong start, Fred.

18:44.567 --> 18:48.487
- The only problem was
it was totally wrong.

18:49.367 --> 18:50.127
You're gonna run out of time, Chris,

18:50.207 --> 18:52.727
there's a time limit on it as well.

18:53.727 --> 18:57.107
- You've already done
over a minute 20 seconds,

18:57.207 --> 18:59.207
and you've done one lap.

18:59.647 --> 19:00.907
- [Freddie] It's not hard.

19:01.007 --> 19:03.307
To get anywhere near the Corsa's 11 laps

19:03.407 --> 19:06.127
in the time, you'd have to drive fast.

19:07.288 --> 19:08.028
- Third gear.

19:08.128 --> 19:09.348
Can I get into fourth?

19:09.448 --> 19:11.468
- [Freddie] Do something,
man, just do something!

19:11.568 --> 19:15.268
- Christopher, that was your fifth lap.

19:15.368 --> 19:19.788
Fifth lap, and you've two
minutes, 50 seconds left.

19:19.888 --> 19:21.388
- This is top fun.

19:21.488 --> 19:23.748
- [Freddie] But with Harris
still none the wiser...

19:23.848 --> 19:25.068
- Yes.

19:25.168 --> 19:28.028
- [Freddie] Eventually, his time ran out.

19:28.128 --> 19:30.648
- Three, two, one, and stop.

19:31.849 --> 19:32.869
- Still going.

19:32.969 --> 19:33.789
It's still going.

19:33.889 --> 19:35.889
It's a little fuel miser.

19:36.609 --> 19:38.469
- Chris, the time is up.

19:38.569 --> 19:39.349
Listen.

19:39.449 --> 19:42.089
(timer beeping)

19:43.689 --> 19:44.789
He's still going.

19:44.889 --> 19:46.069
What's he doing?

19:46.169 --> 19:48.109
- [Freddie] This is embarrassing.

19:48.209 --> 19:49.429
- And she's just died, boys.

19:49.529 --> 19:52.209
After an amazing victory, the Niva dies.

19:53.729 --> 19:55.930
- Did you not understand
the challenge, Chris?

19:57.650 --> 19:59.230
- [Paddy] Harris had failed his Lada

19:59.330 --> 20:02.270
with just eight laps in the time.

20:02.370 --> 20:05.390
So, last to have a crack at the Corsa's

20:05.490 --> 20:08.650
11-lap benchmark was the mighty MG.

20:10.610 --> 20:11.950
Are you ready to go, Patrick?

20:12.050 --> 20:13.790
- Yes.

20:13.890 --> 20:16.430
- [Chris] Three, two, one.

20:16.530 --> 20:17.950
Go!

20:18.050 --> 20:19.031
(dramatic music)

20:19.131 --> 20:21.131
- Go on, MGB!

20:28.291 --> 20:30.671
- He's taking this very
seriously, isn't he?

20:30.771 --> 20:32.771
- Yeah.

20:33.851 --> 20:35.851
- Woohoohoo!

20:37.971 --> 20:41.871
Stirling Moss set a land
speed record in an MG.

20:41.971 --> 20:44.232
Granted, it weren't round a quarry,

20:44.332 --> 20:45.872
with a quid's worth of petrol in it.

20:45.972 --> 20:49.692
But it's got racing DNA
in its blood, this thing.

20:51.852 --> 20:53.152
- Under three minutes now, Pad.

20:53.252 --> 20:55.252
Keep going, under three minutes.

20:56.132 --> 20:58.312
- Right, come on MG, let's go

20:58.412 --> 21:02.812
- That was almost oversteer.
(Freddie laughs)

21:03.972 --> 21:08.393
- [Freddie] Go on!

21:08.493 --> 21:09.353
- Under a minute.

21:09.453 --> 21:11.453
Go on, see if you can get it out.

21:12.413 --> 21:13.713
- [Paddy] Well, it's
getting a bit jottery.

21:13.813 --> 21:14.593
- This is ridiculous.

21:14.693 --> 21:17.813
The old MG's gonna prove to be
more efficient than a Corsa.

21:19.173 --> 21:20.993
Under 30 seconds.

21:21.093 --> 21:22.313
- Still going!

21:22.413 --> 21:24.453
Go on, I hope you're watching this, kids.

21:26.053 --> 21:27.673
- Keep going!
- 10, nine, eight...

21:27.773 --> 21:30.313
- Keep going!
- Seven, six, five-

21:30.413 --> 21:33.094
- Go on!
- Four, three, two, one.

21:36.334 --> 21:37.074
- Oh!

21:37.174 --> 21:39.754
It's just gone at the end, boys!

21:39.854 --> 21:41.854
Oh!

21:42.454 --> 21:43.714
That were a lot of fun.

21:43.814 --> 21:45.094
- It looked so much better
when you was having a go.

21:45.174 --> 21:46.834
- Well, here we go, Pad.

21:46.934 --> 21:49.834
Stig did 11 laps and you were
about to complete your 12th.

21:49.934 --> 21:51.034
So you beat him.

21:51.134 --> 21:52.434
- Fantastic!

21:52.534 --> 21:55.435
Not just a victory for the MGB,

21:55.535 --> 21:58.715
but a victory for the classics, lads.

21:58.815 --> 22:01.115
And with the winner rightly treated

22:01.215 --> 22:03.395
to a bit of help off the field,

22:03.495 --> 22:06.435
fuelled up and point well and truly proven,

22:06.535 --> 22:11.135
we got back to enjoying the
drive in our old-school heroes.

22:12.015 --> 22:15.435
Lads, so, if you go back over 40 years,

22:15.535 --> 22:18.436
that takes us to 1981.

22:18.536 --> 22:20.716
40 years ago, lads.

22:20.816 --> 22:22.676
- My daughter's nearly 17.

22:22.776 --> 22:25.316
I can't imagine that I'm gonna
be teaching her to drive.

22:25.416 --> 22:27.676
I'm not sure I'm the man for that job.

22:27.776 --> 22:30.116
My kids don't listen when
I tell them about cricket.

22:30.216 --> 22:32.436
I've got no chance with driving.

22:32.536 --> 22:33.716
- Well, they're not on their own there,

22:33.816 --> 22:34.996
Fred, let's be honest.

22:35.096 --> 22:36.276
(Freddie laughs)

22:36.376 --> 22:38.816
(rock music)

22:41.296 --> 22:43.957
- Look at the way we
behaved when we were 17.

22:44.057 --> 22:45.677
Everyone was out to go fast.

22:45.777 --> 22:48.197
And if I start saying you can't do that,

22:48.297 --> 22:50.477
I'm just being a hypocrite,
'cause that's what I did!

22:50.577 --> 22:52.077
- I think that's quite
a good selling point

22:52.177 --> 22:53.357
for all three of these cars, isn't it?

22:53.457 --> 22:56.177
You know, the kids can't go fast in 'em.

22:57.217 --> 22:58.757
- [Chris] But despite
the compelling weight

22:58.857 --> 23:01.197
of this argument, the
producers were apparently

23:01.297 --> 23:05.257
still not convinced by the
genius of our first car classics.

23:06.858 --> 23:08.878
Because we were soon told to make a stop

23:08.978 --> 23:13.658
at an abandoned RAF base, with
an unlikely history of speed.

23:16.898 --> 23:19.358
(mysterious music)

23:19.458 --> 23:22.718
Back in the early 1950s,
Davidstow Airfield

23:22.818 --> 23:25.178
played host to Formula One.

23:26.498 --> 23:29.358
As venues go, it was about
as far as you could get

23:29.458 --> 23:31.459
from the glamour of Monte-Carlo.

23:32.059 --> 23:34.359
But nevertheless, the Cornish grand prix

23:34.459 --> 23:39.459
ran three times, and even saw
Lotus win its first ever race.

23:41.859 --> 23:44.419
But remarkable as that may be,

23:46.219 --> 23:50.779
sadly, it had nothing to
do with our next test.

23:52.619 --> 23:54.040
- It's paint, is it, that's coming at us?

23:54.140 --> 23:57.200
'Cause I can't cover my head properly.

23:57.300 --> 23:58.840
I'm just worried about me hair.

23:58.940 --> 24:01.660
(Chris laughing)

24:02.660 --> 24:04.280
People pay a lot of money for this hair.

24:04.380 --> 24:05.140
Don't worry about that, lads.

24:05.220 --> 24:07.680
- "I'm worried about me hair."

24:07.780 --> 24:10.180
- If that doesn't go in
the edit, I'm resigning.

24:11.820 --> 24:14.000
- So, because speed is the biggest cause

24:14.100 --> 24:16.160
of accidents among new drivers,

24:16.260 --> 24:20.081
with our speedos and pretty
much everything else taped over,

24:20.181 --> 24:22.721
we would now see who could get closest

24:22.821 --> 24:25.661
to exactly 50 miles an hour.

24:26.661 --> 24:29.761
Go over, and we'd be out of the game.

24:29.861 --> 24:32.821
As naturally, a paint bomb
would go off inside the car.

24:37.781 --> 24:41.681
So I'm gonna use the logic
of when these cars were new,

24:41.781 --> 24:45.522
nought to 60 around about 14
seconds on mine and Fred's.

24:45.622 --> 24:48.522
So if I do the one
Mississippi, two Mississippi,

24:48.622 --> 24:51.522
till I get to about 10 Mississippi,

24:51.622 --> 24:52.462
I reckon that'll be the cutoff point.

24:52.542 --> 24:54.522
That'll be about 40-odd.

24:54.622 --> 24:55.802
(Freddie laughs)

24:55.902 --> 24:57.482
Right, are we ready?

24:57.582 --> 24:59.582
- Yeah, go on, then.

25:00.102 --> 25:02.942
(engines revving)

25:04.062 --> 25:06.363
- Three, two, one.

25:06.463 --> 25:07.283
Best of luck.

25:07.383 --> 25:10.283
(tense music)

25:10.383 --> 25:12.003
Oh god, here we go.

25:12.103 --> 25:15.323
- This is horrendous.

25:15.423 --> 25:19.223
- One Mississippi, two
Mississippi, three Mississippi.

25:20.583 --> 25:22.403
- Third.

25:22.503 --> 25:24.503
- Come on, the Beetle.

25:25.503 --> 25:26.483
- I'm flat out.

25:26.583 --> 25:28.083
Whatever happens, I'm flat out.

25:28.183 --> 25:31.084
- Six Mississippi, seven Mississippi.

25:31.184 --> 25:32.604
Oh god, eight Mississippi.

25:32.704 --> 25:36.044
- I gotta be up near 30 or 40 here.

25:36.144 --> 25:38.444
- McGuinness is taking liberties there.

25:38.544 --> 25:39.924
Nine Mississippi.

25:40.024 --> 25:40.764
10.

25:40.864 --> 25:41.844
Come on.

25:41.944 --> 25:43.944
I reckon, I reckon...
I reckon

25:44.504 --> 25:47.144
that's about, I mean, I'm
well in front of them two.

25:51.144 --> 25:52.724
(Paddy laughing)

25:52.824 --> 25:55.365
- You were nearly getting
sprayed there, I reckon, Pad.

25:55.465 --> 25:58.785
- If they tell me I got
to 48, then that's me out.

25:59.905 --> 26:01.245
- [Freddie] First run down.

26:01.345 --> 26:04.645
We crawled back to the
start line for the results.

26:04.745 --> 26:07.125
And we would have to decide
whether to stick with the speed

26:07.225 --> 26:12.225
we'd hit or run again to try
and get closer to the magic 50.

26:14.945 --> 26:16.925
- Here we go, lads.

26:17.025 --> 26:18.846
Ho-ho-ho-ho!

26:18.946 --> 26:22.546
Chris, in the Lada, 38 miles per hour.

26:23.826 --> 26:24.566
- Damn.

26:24.666 --> 26:29.046
- Freddie, in the Beetle,
37 miles per hour.

26:29.146 --> 26:30.446
- 37?

26:30.546 --> 26:35.546
- Mr. McGuinness, in the
MGB, 44 miles per hour.

26:36.426 --> 26:37.646
- Oh, no!

26:37.746 --> 26:39.446
- I'm sticking, boys.

26:39.546 --> 26:40.486
- No!

26:40.586 --> 26:41.967
(Paddy laughing)

26:42.067 --> 26:43.607
I'm last, I'm going again.

26:43.707 --> 26:45.087
- Mr. Harris?

26:45.187 --> 26:47.767
- Well, I've got to twist
and I don't want to.

26:47.867 --> 26:49.847
(tense music)

26:49.947 --> 26:51.947
- I'll count you off, boys.

26:53.427 --> 26:54.647
- Go on then, Chris.

26:54.747 --> 26:55.487
- Ugh.

26:55.587 --> 26:57.607
- Three, two, one, go!

26:57.707 --> 26:59.647
(tense music)

26:59.747 --> 27:01.367
- Flintoff.

27:01.467 --> 27:05.128
Right, first, that's gotta be about 20.

27:05.228 --> 27:07.488
Little bit more than I had last time.

27:07.588 --> 27:09.588
- Second gear.

27:10.748 --> 27:12.748
Oh, Harris has gone for it.

27:15.108 --> 27:16.768
- They're moving a bit.

27:16.868 --> 27:17.608
- It's a bit bumpy.

27:17.708 --> 27:19.708
I've got me foot on the floor in third.

27:23.748 --> 27:25.748
- There.

27:26.708 --> 27:29.529
- Not sure I could have gone
any faster there, Chris.

27:29.629 --> 27:30.849
- This is ridiculous.

27:30.949 --> 27:32.049
(light music)

27:32.149 --> 27:33.449
- [Paddy] What are you thinking, lads?

27:33.549 --> 27:36.809
- I reckon that was around 45 for me.

27:36.909 --> 27:38.929
I don't reckon I can go
much quicker than that

27:39.029 --> 27:39.729
without risking it.

27:39.829 --> 27:41.369
- I think I got over 40, Pad, but I had

27:41.469 --> 27:43.129
me foot on the floor.

27:43.229 --> 27:45.229
I need flatter ground.

27:46.549 --> 27:48.549
- Thank you.

27:51.149 --> 27:52.369
Oh...

27:52.469 --> 27:53.770
My...

27:53.870 --> 27:55.090
Days.

27:55.190 --> 27:56.490
Mr. Flintoff.

27:56.590 --> 27:57.330
- Yeah?

27:57.430 --> 27:59.450
- [Paddy] 42.

27:59.550 --> 28:00.930
- Aww!

28:01.030 --> 28:06.170
- Still under McGuiness's
time of 44, but Mr. Harris.

28:06.270 --> 28:08.810
Maximum speed to hit
before the paint goes off,

28:08.910 --> 28:11.090
50 miles per hour.

28:11.190 --> 28:15.890
Christopher Harris, you did it in 49!

28:15.950 --> 28:16.690
- No!

28:16.790 --> 28:18.131
- [Paddy] Miles per hour.

28:18.231 --> 28:19.411
- [Freddie] I'm not having that.

28:19.511 --> 28:20.211
I'm not having that.

28:20.311 --> 28:21.611
We've gotta go, Pad.

28:21.711 --> 28:24.531
(Chris laughing)

28:24.631 --> 28:26.171
- No.

28:26.271 --> 28:28.251
Oh no, it's a northern-off.

28:28.351 --> 28:29.171
(suspenseful music)

28:29.271 --> 28:32.611
- Harris and his Niva had
thrown down the gauntlet.

28:32.711 --> 28:35.731
Meaning McGuinness was back
at the table against me

28:35.831 --> 28:38.351
and the stakes were getting higher.

28:39.311 --> 28:42.412
- Paddy, I'm gonna to back
up and give meself a run-up.

28:42.512 --> 28:44.512
- Oh god, here we go.

28:47.072 --> 28:48.852
- The chips are in the middle, Paddy.

28:48.952 --> 28:51.132
I'm going all in.

28:51.232 --> 28:53.232
- I think he's going to the next county.

28:53.872 --> 28:55.932
- It's 'cause it's uphill.

28:56.032 --> 28:59.012
(Paddy sighs)

28:59.112 --> 29:01.592
(tense music)

29:03.472 --> 29:04.452
Boys, I'm off.

29:04.552 --> 29:05.533
I'm off!

29:05.633 --> 29:06.933
- Cut me in, Chris.

29:07.033 --> 29:09.033
- [Chris] Three, two, one, go!

29:10.153 --> 29:12.053
(tense music)

29:12.153 --> 29:13.093
- Ooh, he's gone.

29:13.193 --> 29:16.693
- Oh, Flintoff, flying into it.

29:16.793 --> 29:18.173
- Come on.

29:18.273 --> 29:20.493
- 49, that is crazy.

29:20.593 --> 29:21.853
- Come on.

29:21.953 --> 29:25.013
- Oh stop, I'm not doing me
Mississippis, I've lost meself!

29:25.113 --> 29:26.293
- Come on.

29:26.393 --> 29:27.293
Come on.

29:27.393 --> 29:28.133
- Oh no.

29:28.233 --> 29:29.734
Oh, that's feeling fast.

29:29.834 --> 29:31.654
- Come on!

29:31.754 --> 29:32.494
- Oh!

29:32.594 --> 29:36.654
- Come on, the Beetle!

29:36.754 --> 29:37.494
- There.

29:37.594 --> 29:40.594
Right, I'm (bleep).

29:43.114 --> 29:44.054
Oh no!

29:44.154 --> 29:46.894
- Paddy's gone, Chris,
Paddy's disqualified.

29:46.994 --> 29:49.754
(Chris laughing)

29:51.634 --> 29:53.635
- Oh, god.

29:56.795 --> 29:58.295
That is not good.

29:58.395 --> 30:00.015
(upbeat music)

30:00.115 --> 30:03.335
Eventually, I found me way
back to the start line.

30:03.435 --> 30:04.175
I can't see.

30:04.275 --> 30:05.535
Where am I?

30:05.635 --> 30:06.375
Oh god.

30:06.475 --> 30:07.215
(Chris laughs)

30:07.315 --> 30:08.055
I've hit a cone, lads!

30:08.155 --> 30:09.735
And the results were in.

30:09.835 --> 30:11.835
Thank you.

30:14.635 --> 30:16.636
Ooh, ho-ho-ho-ho!

30:18.596 --> 30:21.336
I was doing 51.

30:21.436 --> 30:25.776
Chris Harris, your time
was 49 miles per hour.

30:25.876 --> 30:27.696
- Here we go.

30:27.796 --> 30:32.456
- Mr. Flintoff, in the
Beetle, your time is...

30:32.556 --> 30:36.136
49 miles per hour!

30:36.236 --> 30:38.416
We've got a twist-off, boys!

30:38.516 --> 30:39.736
- Oh, no!

30:39.836 --> 30:40.937
(suspenseful music)

30:41.037 --> 30:41.777
- Oh, yes.

30:41.877 --> 30:46.617
It was Beetle versus Niva
for one final showdown.

30:46.717 --> 30:48.217
What have you got, Harris?

30:48.317 --> 30:49.817
Push them chips in the middle, son.

30:49.917 --> 30:50.657
What have you got?

30:50.757 --> 30:55.137
And to make sure the V-Dub
could definitely hit 50,

30:55.237 --> 30:59.077
we'd be lining up from the
other end, pointing downhill.

31:00.157 --> 31:03.577
- This is it, boys,
this is for the big one.

31:03.677 --> 31:05.698
Go hard or go home.

31:05.798 --> 31:06.698
Here we go!

31:06.798 --> 31:09.338
Three, two, one, bet the lot!

31:09.438 --> 31:12.698
(suspenseful music)

31:12.798 --> 31:15.298
- Don't be backing off
on it, Chris, come on..

31:15.398 --> 31:16.218
- Come on then, Flintoff.

31:16.318 --> 31:18.378
Come on then, Flintoff.

31:18.478 --> 31:20.578
Come on then, Flintoff.

31:20.678 --> 31:22.698
- Ooh, it's looking quick, lads!

31:22.798 --> 31:24.898
- [Freddie] It's 50 mile
an hour coming in, Harris.

31:24.998 --> 31:27.138
- That's enough for me.

31:27.238 --> 31:29.239
- [Paddy] Keep going, Fred!

31:29.759 --> 31:31.739
- Come on.

31:31.839 --> 31:33.839
I'm running out of runway.

31:35.559 --> 31:37.559
Oh!

31:40.399 --> 31:41.139
Come on, Paddy.

31:41.239 --> 31:42.539
What's the numbers?

31:42.639 --> 31:47.379
- Ooh, ho-ho-ho, boys!

31:47.479 --> 31:49.479
Chris Harris...

31:49.999 --> 31:51.299
50 miles per hour.

31:51.399 --> 31:53.420
- Yes!

31:53.520 --> 31:54.660
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!

31:54.760 --> 31:56.760
- Mr. Flintoff...

31:57.920 --> 31:59.660
50 miles per hour!

31:59.760 --> 32:01.820
It's a draw, boys!

32:01.920 --> 32:03.300
- Does that mean I'm
the winner 'cause Chris

32:03.400 --> 32:05.700
was following me trying
to keep up with my speed?

32:05.800 --> 32:09.340
- We can argue the toss about
that after I've had a shower.

32:09.440 --> 32:12.600
(audience applauding)

32:14.800 --> 32:16.661
- I was not wrecking
the interior of my car.

32:16.761 --> 32:17.941
I was not wrecking it.

32:18.041 --> 32:18.981
No way.

32:19.081 --> 32:20.381
- That paint bomb going off.

32:20.481 --> 32:21.221
- Oh.

32:21.321 --> 32:23.821
- I don't mind admitting
I was genuinely nervous.

32:23.921 --> 32:26.301
- It took me a week to get it
out of every nook and cranny,

32:26.401 --> 32:27.221
and then I started on the car.

32:27.321 --> 32:29.261
- You've only got yourself
to blame though, Pad,

32:29.361 --> 32:31.621
because myself and Fred, we're more

32:31.721 --> 32:33.461
at one with our vehicles, we tend to be.

32:33.561 --> 32:34.701
You can't teach it, it's natural.

32:34.801 --> 32:36.781
It's car synergy.

32:36.881 --> 32:37.941
- There's nothing to boast about,

32:38.041 --> 32:39.661
you literally had two cars that wouldn't

32:39.761 --> 32:40.782
get to 50 miles per hour.

32:40.882 --> 32:41.622
- That is true.

32:41.722 --> 32:42.582
- All right, Tony Hart.

32:42.682 --> 32:43.982
Listen to Morph.

32:44.082 --> 32:45.222
Anyway.

32:45.322 --> 32:47.182
We'll get back to that film later.

32:47.282 --> 32:48.982
It's time to move on.

32:49.082 --> 32:49.822
- Yes.

32:49.922 --> 32:50.662
Yes it is.

32:50.762 --> 32:52.422
Tonight, we're celebrating the brilliance

32:52.522 --> 32:55.822
of old cars, and if you're
talking brilliant old cars,

32:55.922 --> 32:59.742
there's one that stands head
and shoulders above the rest.

32:59.842 --> 33:01.342
Take a look at this.

33:01.442 --> 33:03.663
(solemn music)

33:03.763 --> 33:06.963
This is the story of
the Lamborghini Miura.

33:07.883 --> 33:10.643
(dramatic music)

33:12.123 --> 33:14.163
It was introduced to the world in 1966,

33:16.603 --> 33:19.703
and it remains one of the most beautiful,

33:19.803 --> 33:22.283
most important cars of them all.

33:30.564 --> 33:33.844
This is supercar genesis.

33:34.844 --> 33:37.924
(Film reel rattling)

33:39.164 --> 33:41.064
(upbeat music)

33:41.164 --> 33:43.164
Oh, yes.

33:44.164 --> 33:46.164
Yes!

33:47.044 --> 33:50.884
What did this look and
feel like in the mid-60s?

33:55.845 --> 33:57.545
Before the Miura there were fast cars.

33:57.645 --> 34:00.185
Before the Miura of course
they were beautiful cars.

34:00.285 --> 34:04.205
But there was nothing
as outrageous as this.

34:05.805 --> 34:08.225
And like all the great inventions,

34:08.325 --> 34:11.725
of course it was born out of a feud.

34:16.206 --> 34:21.206
A feud that begins in late-50s Italy,

34:21.566 --> 34:25.446
where a businessman by the
name of Ferruccio Lamborghini

34:27.286 --> 34:30.806
has become rather successful
in the world of tractors.

34:32.166 --> 34:34.826
Ferruccio is making so much money,

34:34.926 --> 34:37.646
he's bought himself a few Ferraris.

34:38.966 --> 34:40.667
Trouble is, they keep breaking down

34:40.767 --> 34:43.187
and costing a bomb to repair.

34:43.287 --> 34:45.307
So he takes one apart and discovers

34:45.407 --> 34:47.427
that his beautiful Ferrari actually uses

34:47.527 --> 34:50.487
the same cheap clutch as his tractors.

34:52.887 --> 34:55.447
Ferruccio is not best pleased.

34:56.607 --> 35:00.507
Tracking down the boss,
Enzo Ferrari, he says,

35:00.607 --> 35:04.468
"you build your beautiful
cars with my tractor parts."

35:04.568 --> 35:07.308
"My cars are the best in
the world," Enzo replies,

35:07.408 --> 35:11.308
before adding, "you are
just a tractor driver.

35:11.408 --> 35:13.408
A farmer."

35:14.968 --> 35:17.708
Now Ferruccio doesn't take this too well.

35:17.808 --> 35:21.308
Incensed, he vows to seek revenge on Enzo

35:21.408 --> 35:26.228
by starting his own car
company, Automobili Lamborghini.

35:26.328 --> 35:29.049
(dramatic music)

35:31.129 --> 35:33.929
First out of the factory was the 350 GT.

35:35.569 --> 35:38.969
It was very nice, but it
was also a bit Ferrari.

35:40.529 --> 35:43.949
To really stick it to Enzo,
Ferruccio and his team

35:44.049 --> 35:47.689
of brilliant young engineers
needed to change the game.

35:48.569 --> 35:49.909
They needed a car that would make

35:50.009 --> 35:55.010
the entire world stop and stare.

35:57.170 --> 35:59.990
And boy, did they nail it!

36:00.090 --> 36:04.210
This is a masterpiece of design.

36:07.130 --> 36:11.030
But even more amazingly, it
seems no one can agree on

36:11.130 --> 36:12.830
who actually designed it.

36:12.930 --> 36:14.310
There's a big plaque that says it came

36:14.410 --> 36:17.071
from Bertone styling house,
but within that styling house,

36:17.171 --> 36:22.031
there were two young designers,
Gandini and Giugiaro.

36:22.131 --> 36:24.751
Now Gandini claims he
was the one that drew it,

36:24.851 --> 36:28.511
but Giugiaro stuck his hand up
as well and said, "I did it!"

36:28.611 --> 36:31.991
I mean, imagine not knowing
who painted the Mona Lisa!

36:32.091 --> 36:32.851
That's what we're talking about here.

36:32.931 --> 36:36.651
One of the most beautiful
cars ever, ever drawn,

36:38.011 --> 36:40.512
and we still don't quite know who did it.

36:40.612 --> 36:42.312
(light music)

36:42.412 --> 36:44.632
One thing is certain, though.

36:44.732 --> 36:47.352
The look of the Miura
was only the beginning

36:47.452 --> 36:49.932
of Lamborghini's out-there approach.

36:50.932 --> 36:52.032
Take the engine.

36:52.132 --> 36:55.992
To make sure the car also had
the pace to embarrass Ferrari,

36:56.092 --> 37:00.032
it was a 3.9 litre V12, but inspired

37:00.132 --> 37:03.233
by the original Mini, that
engine shared its casing

37:03.333 --> 37:05.873
with the gearbox to save space,

37:05.973 --> 37:09.713
and was mounted sideways behind the driver

37:09.813 --> 37:11.813
for better weight distribution.

37:16.773 --> 37:18.773
And what an engine it was!

37:19.893 --> 37:22.113
Bizzarrini V12.

37:22.213 --> 37:24.953
Smaller, lighter, and more powerful

37:25.053 --> 37:27.194
than anything Ferrari had at the time.

37:27.294 --> 37:30.034
It had 350 horsepower.

37:30.134 --> 37:34.314
This later SV car, 385 horsepower.

37:34.414 --> 37:37.714
Big numbers back then, and I can see

37:37.814 --> 37:40.154
the carburettor and the
throttles moving behind me.

37:40.254 --> 37:43.514
Every time I push the
pedal, you can see it moving.

37:43.614 --> 37:46.234
It feels like I'm just off
the side of the engine,

37:46.334 --> 37:47.074
'cause I am!

37:47.174 --> 37:49.214
It's about six inches
away from my shoulder.

37:52.335 --> 37:54.335
And the noise!

37:56.935 --> 37:58.935
Oh, ho-ho.

37:59.255 --> 38:00.435
Top speed?

38:00.535 --> 38:02.955
Well, in true Lamborghini fashion,

38:03.055 --> 38:04.955
nobody quite knows that either,

38:05.055 --> 38:08.555
but it was at least 170 miles per hour,

38:08.655 --> 38:11.675
which crucially made the Miura faster

38:11.775 --> 38:14.456
than anything Ferrari
was selling at the time.

38:15.896 --> 38:19.576
Wing mirrors were optional in 1966.

38:20.496 --> 38:21.716
Why did you need them?

38:21.816 --> 38:24.696
Who was gonna overtake you
if you were driving a Miura?

38:28.496 --> 38:32.076
This was the fastest
road car in the world.

38:32.176 --> 38:33.196
There were no questions.

38:33.296 --> 38:35.296
It was the fastest.

38:36.536 --> 38:38.677
Or at least...

38:38.777 --> 38:40.777
It was when it worked.

38:41.497 --> 38:43.237
Early Miuras were built using steel

38:43.337 --> 38:45.557
less than one millimetre thick.

38:45.657 --> 38:50.037
They were fragile, temperamental
cars, and they broke a lot.

38:50.137 --> 38:53.277
The headlights were borrowed from a Fiat,

38:53.377 --> 38:54.957
and they were rubbish.

38:55.057 --> 38:57.317
One owner apparently confronted Ferruccio,

38:57.417 --> 38:59.637
saying his car was
lethal to drive at night,

38:59.737 --> 39:02.318
to which Ferruccio
replied, "What gentleman

39:02.418 --> 39:05.418
would want to spend his nights in a car?"

39:07.098 --> 39:09.838
Caddish retorts were all well and good,

39:09.938 --> 39:12.798
but in fact, the headlights were the least

39:12.898 --> 39:14.898
of the Miura's problems.

39:18.418 --> 39:21.558
The V12's carburettors had this habit

39:21.658 --> 39:24.998
of dripping fuel down to the spark plugs,

39:25.098 --> 39:30.039
which occasionally
resulted in a massive fire,

39:30.139 --> 39:32.779
which kept owners on their toes.

39:33.779 --> 39:35.999
As did the handling at very high speeds,

39:36.099 --> 39:38.159
because the fuel tank's in the front,

39:38.259 --> 39:43.079
so when it was low on
fuel, the front would lift.

39:43.179 --> 39:47.319
So yeah, your Miura
could become an aeroplane.

39:47.419 --> 39:49.279
(solemn music)

39:49.379 --> 39:50.600
It was hardly surprising.

39:50.700 --> 39:53.640
Lamborghini's engineers
hadn't had test tracks

39:53.740 --> 39:55.520
or wind tunnels.

39:55.620 --> 39:57.920
It was only once the car got onto the road

39:58.020 --> 40:01.580
that they could see if their
great experiment had worked.

40:02.420 --> 40:06.220
This was a car born out of
improvisation and passion.

40:07.380 --> 40:11.220
Bravery and, it would seem quite
a lot of stupidity as well.

40:13.340 --> 40:16.241
This interior is completely bonkers!

40:16.341 --> 40:18.321
The speedometers obscured,
the rev counter's

40:18.421 --> 40:20.041
hidden behind the steering wheel.

40:20.141 --> 40:22.281
I can't see any of this
stuff, it's too low.

40:22.381 --> 40:25.961
It was just designed to look
great, to make you feel great.

40:26.061 --> 40:27.561
It doesn't matter if it works or not.

40:27.661 --> 40:30.361
It just makes you feel special.

40:30.461 --> 40:33.281
(light music)

40:33.381 --> 40:35.121
It was a neat trick.

40:35.221 --> 40:39.482
The Miura felt so special
that it quickly became

40:39.582 --> 40:43.002
the ultimate superstar accessory.

40:43.102 --> 40:46.042
Miles Davis had one, Frank Sinatra,

40:46.142 --> 40:48.422
Twiggy, Rod Stewart had two.

40:51.022 --> 40:54.362
But for the rest of the
world, it was in 1969's

40:54.462 --> 40:59.462
"The Italian Job" that the
Miura truly became an icon.

41:09.903 --> 41:12.363
There's no decade in modern history

41:12.463 --> 41:14.463
that's more romanticised than the 1960s.

41:15.423 --> 41:17.643
And this is the supercar of the 60s.

41:17.743 --> 41:21.443
You just imagine the way it
was developed, the passion.

41:21.543 --> 41:24.163
There's nothing logical or
pragmatic about it at all.

41:24.263 --> 41:27.844
It's just a piece of green
ridiculousness on wheels,

41:27.944 --> 41:30.304
and I absolutely adore it for that.

41:39.064 --> 41:41.124
The Miura proved for the first time

41:41.224 --> 41:44.884
that a car could be admired
not because it was practical,

41:44.984 --> 41:49.324
or comfortable, or safe, nor
even, like its great rivals

41:49.424 --> 41:52.445
from Ferrari, because
it had racing pedigree

41:52.545 --> 41:54.545
to match its pace.

41:55.905 --> 41:59.965
Instead, the Miura proved
that a car could be admired

42:00.065 --> 42:02.945
simply for being extraordinary.

42:03.865 --> 42:08.205
Every supercar since,
Ferrari F40, McLaren F1,

42:08.305 --> 42:12.805
Pagani Zonda, they all owe
their existence to this car.

42:12.905 --> 42:16.286
This is where it all started.

42:16.386 --> 42:18.786
This is the original.

42:45.067 --> 42:48.227
(audience applauding)

42:50.347 --> 42:52.347
- Love it, love it.

42:52.787 --> 42:54.367
- That is a stunning car.

42:54.467 --> 42:56.407
- Yeah.
- Stunning car.

42:56.507 --> 42:57.327
- Do you know what?

42:57.427 --> 42:59.647
I do love a proper Chris Harris deep dive.

42:59.747 --> 43:02.128
You really come away feeling
like you've learned something.

43:02.228 --> 43:04.848
- Yeah, a lot of information
there, not a lot of laughs.

43:04.948 --> 43:06.608
But a lot of information.

43:06.708 --> 43:08.728
- And 1966, what a year.

43:08.828 --> 43:12.048
Birth of the Miura, England
winning the World Cup,

43:12.148 --> 43:13.968
and Doritos were invented.

43:14.068 --> 43:15.168
- Were they?
- Doritos?

43:15.268 --> 43:16.608
- Correct, yes.

43:16.708 --> 43:21.708
'66 Doritos, '73 Hula Hoops, '75 Frazzles.

43:22.868 --> 43:25.049
Oh, I've got facts too.

43:25.149 --> 43:27.169
And don't even get me started on biscuits.

43:27.269 --> 43:29.329
- I'm moving on before
you start on Quavers.

43:29.429 --> 43:32.729
Anyway, it's time to get back
to our West Country road trip,

43:32.829 --> 43:33.969
where we were about to find out

43:34.069 --> 43:36.529
whether our old cars for new drivers idea

43:36.629 --> 43:39.629
was really the brilliant
brainwave we thought it was.

43:40.549 --> 43:43.109
(solemn music)

43:48.509 --> 43:51.270
(waves crashing)

43:53.150 --> 43:56.610
- [Chris] Bathed as it was
in sunshine and blue skies,

43:56.710 --> 43:59.530
as we arrived the next
morning at the Cornish coast,

43:59.630 --> 44:03.030
the car gods were clearly
smiling on our cause.

44:04.190 --> 44:06.190
Oh, look at the ocean, boys.

44:06.550 --> 44:08.550
- The Atlantic that, I think.

44:09.110 --> 44:10.450
- [Paddy] Beautiful.

44:10.550 --> 44:13.411
- [Chris] But the producers
were still not on board

44:13.511 --> 44:16.831
with our old cars for new drivers concept.

44:17.991 --> 44:20.571
And at Perranporth Airfield,
they said it was time

44:20.671 --> 44:23.351
to sort things out once and for all.

44:24.431 --> 44:26.691
- Who have we got here?

44:26.791 --> 44:29.331
- Lads, I spy young people.

44:29.431 --> 44:31.691
- Oh, here we go.
- Oh dear.

44:31.791 --> 44:32.891
(upbeat music)

44:32.991 --> 44:36.051
- [Chris] Yes, to find out
what some actual new drivers

44:36.151 --> 44:39.452
made of our cars, we'd
each been paired with one

44:39.552 --> 44:42.132
to take on a driving test.

44:42.232 --> 44:42.932
- [Paddy] Hello!

44:43.032 --> 44:45.172
- Hiya pal, I'm Fred.
- How are you, I'm Sainaath.

44:45.272 --> 44:47.012
- Sainaath, nice to meet you, mate.

44:47.112 --> 44:49.292
- I'm Charlotte.
- Hello Charlotte, I'm Chris.

44:49.392 --> 44:50.692
- Hi, nice to meet you.

44:50.792 --> 44:52.252
- What's your name, pal?
- Heathcliff.

44:52.352 --> 44:53.092
- Heathcliff.

44:53.192 --> 44:53.932
Love it.

44:54.032 --> 44:54.732
Great name.

44:54.832 --> 44:55.692
Get your seatbelt on, son.

44:55.792 --> 44:57.092
- Where is the seatbelt?

44:57.192 --> 44:58.052
- Can you see it?

44:58.152 --> 44:59.172
That's it.

44:59.272 --> 45:00.252
- It's not coming over.

45:00.352 --> 45:01.333
- Have you got it?

45:01.433 --> 45:04.013
- Nice and easy,
Heathcliff, nice and gentle.

45:04.113 --> 45:04.853
Have you got it?

45:04.953 --> 45:05.693
- I think so, yeah.

45:05.793 --> 45:07.773
- There you are, son, get it in that there.

45:07.873 --> 45:09.013
Hold on.

45:09.113 --> 45:09.813
Right.

45:09.913 --> 45:13.373
So while the younguns get
familiar with our classics...

45:13.473 --> 45:14.493
- It just seems to get stuck there.

45:14.593 --> 45:17.493
- [Paddy] Let's have a look
at the irresponsibly designed

45:17.593 --> 45:22.273
tests we'd be taking with
Stig and his trusty Corsa.

45:24.193 --> 45:27.534
Naturally, we kick off with a hill start.

45:27.634 --> 45:30.254
Then there's a roadblock,
where you get on the horn

45:30.354 --> 45:32.354
to clear the van out of the way.

45:32.954 --> 45:35.934
Up next is a reverse around a roundabout

45:36.034 --> 45:38.254
before a toll barrier that, once opened,

45:38.354 --> 45:40.914
of course means you can gun it.

45:42.234 --> 45:46.094
Then it's a slalom through a
traffic jam of stationary cars,

45:46.194 --> 45:48.334
slamming on the anchors
for an emergency stop,

45:48.434 --> 45:50.855
where we would swap drivers.

45:50.955 --> 45:52.295
Standard.

45:52.395 --> 45:54.775
The final stint would see our teams

45:54.875 --> 45:58.095
use their phones to sat nav
us 10 miles down the road

45:58.195 --> 46:03.195
to that first car road trip
driving mecca, Newquay.

46:04.075 --> 46:06.895
The winner would be whoever
reached the Headland Hotel

46:06.995 --> 46:09.255
in the fastest time.

46:09.355 --> 46:11.375
But with both team and car needed

46:11.475 --> 46:15.496
to work in perfect harmony,
it'd be fair to say

46:15.596 --> 46:18.596
we hadn't got off to the best of starts.

46:20.476 --> 46:22.576
- Oh, are you a fan of cricket?

46:22.676 --> 46:24.216
- Yeah.
- Do you watch IPL?

46:24.316 --> 46:25.456
- Yeah.

46:25.556 --> 46:27.096
- What team do you support?

46:27.196 --> 46:27.936
Like preferably.

46:28.036 --> 46:29.336
- Chennai Super Kings.

46:29.436 --> 46:30.296
- My guy.
- Are you Chennai?

46:30.396 --> 46:31.216
- Yeah, 'cause it's Tamil, isn't it?

46:31.316 --> 46:32.416
Tamil in the heart.
- Are you a big fan?

46:32.516 --> 46:33.696
- Yeah, a big fan.

46:33.796 --> 46:36.016
- I played for Chennai Super Kings.

46:36.116 --> 46:37.017
- Really?

46:37.117 --> 46:38.977
What year?

46:39.077 --> 46:40.537
- 2008.

46:40.637 --> 46:41.697
- I mean I was a baby at the time,

46:41.797 --> 46:43.797
so I didn't watch cricket back then.

46:46.437 --> 46:47.217
(upbeat music)

46:47.317 --> 46:48.337
- Right.

46:48.437 --> 46:49.197
- The gear shift, actually, when you

46:49.277 --> 46:50.457
concentrate on it, is lovely.

46:50.557 --> 46:51.937
It's, you know, only four gears.

46:52.037 --> 46:53.537
One, two, three, four, in an H.

46:53.637 --> 46:54.857
So like the car you drove.

46:54.957 --> 46:56.377
- Right.
- Back to fourth.

46:56.477 --> 46:58.737
The clutch and the pedals
you'll find really weird,

46:58.837 --> 47:01.298
'cause the throttle is really far back...

47:01.398 --> 47:04.578
(upbeat music)

47:04.678 --> 47:05.938
- [Charlotte] Oh my god.

47:06.038 --> 47:08.578
- And the thing about this
is it's only four gears.

47:08.678 --> 47:09.418
- Yeah.

47:09.518 --> 47:10.238
- So you'll soon get used to it,

47:10.318 --> 47:12.578
but like it's just, they're
just very close together.
- Yeah.

47:12.678 --> 47:14.978
- And I'll tell you now, when did you pass?

47:15.078 --> 47:17.238
- A month and 15 days ago.

47:20.198 --> 47:21.298
- I started getting into cricket

47:21.398 --> 47:24.019
when I was like 15 or like 13, 14.
- Right.

47:24.119 --> 47:26.139
Yeah.

47:26.239 --> 47:28.379
- Yeah, you know what, Fred?

47:28.479 --> 47:31.139
- What about the 2005
Ashes, you heard of that?

47:31.239 --> 47:32.339
- Not even.

47:32.439 --> 47:33.179
Do you know what?

47:33.279 --> 47:33.979
- No?
- Like when I get home-

47:34.079 --> 47:36.739
- The first time England
won the Ashes for 21 years?

47:36.839 --> 47:38.179
- Okay.

47:38.279 --> 47:40.359
- [Freddie] Has the
game moved on that much?

47:41.879 --> 47:44.019
- Before his young teammate could answer,

47:44.119 --> 47:47.039
mercifully it was time
for the test to begin.

47:48.280 --> 47:51.360
Where, lined up for a staggered
start a few minutes apart,

47:52.280 --> 47:54.640
Team Beetle would be up first.

47:56.440 --> 47:57.780
- When the light's here, Sainaath.

47:57.880 --> 47:58.620
Are you ready?

47:58.720 --> 48:00.720
Hill start.

48:01.520 --> 48:03.380
Green, go, go, go!

48:03.480 --> 48:05.020
Get the handbrake down.

48:05.120 --> 48:08.040
Whoa, wheel spin off the, whoa!

48:10.760 --> 48:12.661
Nicely done, that's a nice start.

48:12.761 --> 48:15.181
Here you go, go a left here,
get that steering wheel round.

48:15.281 --> 48:16.041
It's heavier than you think.

48:16.121 --> 48:17.541
And shall we move him out of the way?

48:17.641 --> 48:18.981
Sound it.
(horn honking)

48:19.081 --> 48:19.821
Hold on a minute.

48:19.921 --> 48:21.301
There we go.

48:21.401 --> 48:23.401
Into reverse.

48:29.601 --> 48:30.341
- I am in reverse.

48:30.441 --> 48:33.221
- Go on, try, bit of gas, bit of gas.

48:33.321 --> 48:34.021
Oh.

48:34.121 --> 48:36.602
Oh, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop!

48:38.122 --> 48:40.122
- [Paddy] Here we go.

48:41.802 --> 48:42.662
Oh!

48:42.762 --> 48:44.342
Lovely!

48:44.442 --> 48:45.782
A 90 left, Heathcliff, that's what we say

48:45.882 --> 48:47.222
in the racing game.

48:47.322 --> 48:48.542
- Where's the horn?
- Right stalk.

48:48.642 --> 48:49.822
Give him a pip.
(horn honking)

48:49.922 --> 48:50.662
Come on, get out the way.

48:50.762 --> 48:51.502
Out the way, you bellend!

48:51.602 --> 48:55.142
That's a word you use a lot
when you start driving, bellend.

48:55.242 --> 48:57.942
- Left hand down, left hand
down, down, down, all round.

48:58.042 --> 48:59.062
Keep moving.

48:59.162 --> 49:00.343
There you go, just keep it there.

49:00.443 --> 49:01.463
Keep moving.

49:01.563 --> 49:03.703
Perfect.

49:03.803 --> 49:05.183
- No stress.
- No stress.

49:05.283 --> 49:08.303
- No stress.
- This is gonna be fun.

49:08.403 --> 49:10.403
Okay.

49:13.283 --> 49:14.623
Okay, we're going.

49:14.723 --> 49:15.463
- Yeah!

49:15.563 --> 49:16.303
Look at that!

49:16.403 --> 49:17.103
You smashed it!

49:17.203 --> 49:18.743
Whoa whoa, now back off a bit.

49:18.843 --> 49:20.103
Second.

49:20.203 --> 49:22.103
Brake now, brake now, brake now.

49:22.203 --> 49:22.943
Okay, sound the horn.

49:23.043 --> 49:24.104
- Sound the horn.
(horn honking)

49:24.204 --> 49:25.104
Move, bruv!

49:25.204 --> 49:26.164
- Get him out the way, first
gear again, first gear again.

49:26.244 --> 49:27.064
Well done.

49:27.164 --> 49:27.864
- Toll road.

49:27.964 --> 49:29.184
I'll lend you a pound.

49:29.284 --> 49:30.984
- Hello, mate.
- Thank you.

49:31.084 --> 49:34.064
- Oh, we've stalled, we've stalled.

49:34.164 --> 49:35.544
Get that clutch in.

49:35.644 --> 49:37.504
Ah, here we go, traffic jam.

49:37.604 --> 49:38.864
Coming up.

49:38.964 --> 49:40.624
There we go, give it some gas.

49:40.724 --> 49:42.304
You're good, you're good,
you're good, you're good.

49:42.404 --> 49:43.384
- The cones.
- Get in second.

49:43.484 --> 49:44.704
- In second.
- Now go that way.

49:44.804 --> 49:46.224
- That way, left?

49:46.324 --> 49:48.225
- Oh, oh, oh, oh!

49:48.325 --> 49:50.785
Who reverses round a roundabout?

49:50.885 --> 49:52.505
- Oh!

49:52.605 --> 49:56.465
Look at this, it's just two
brothers out on the road.

49:56.565 --> 49:57.585
Here you are, there's a quid.

49:57.685 --> 49:58.765
Get your window down, wind
it down first, wind it down.

49:58.845 --> 50:00.345
- Oh, I can't get it.

50:00.445 --> 50:01.305
- Go, go, go.

50:01.405 --> 50:02.705
This is old school, Heathcliff.

50:02.805 --> 50:04.805
Give it him.

50:05.925 --> 50:07.745
- Oh my word.

50:07.845 --> 50:09.985
Nice and smooth, Sainaath.

50:10.085 --> 50:12.086
Blooming heck.

50:13.326 --> 50:14.666
- See, that's my casual styling, man.

50:14.766 --> 50:15.506
- Oh, is this your style?

50:15.606 --> 50:16.366
You're all right now, aren't you?

50:16.446 --> 50:17.986
You weren't like this back there.

50:18.086 --> 50:19.426
Two hands, two hands.

50:19.526 --> 50:20.586
- Two hands, yeah?

50:20.686 --> 50:22.806
- Emergency stop, oh!

50:25.406 --> 50:26.386
Nice.

50:26.486 --> 50:27.466
Well done, mate.

50:27.566 --> 50:29.746
- [Chris] So, Team Beetle
had reached the end

50:29.846 --> 50:32.606
of the first leg, and
having swapped drivers,

50:33.606 --> 50:35.947
were on their way out of the airfield...

50:36.047 --> 50:36.867
- Oh, that's better.

50:36.967 --> 50:38.587
- [Chris] And onto the final 10-mile

50:38.687 --> 50:42.027
navigation dash to Newquay.

50:42.127 --> 50:42.947
- Here you go, which way we going?

50:43.047 --> 50:45.047
- So we are going left.

50:46.407 --> 50:49.347
- [Chris] But Team MG were also now

50:49.447 --> 50:51.907
flying towards the end of the course.

50:52.007 --> 50:53.707
- Can't believe you've
only passed your test

50:53.807 --> 50:55.547
a month ago, son.

50:55.647 --> 50:59.687
- This is very impressive!
- Can I stop?

50:59.808 --> 51:01.628
Oh ho-ho-ho!

51:01.728 --> 51:03.388
Heathcliff!

51:03.488 --> 51:05.628
- [Chris] And as McGuiness
and his young padawan

51:05.728 --> 51:07.968
swapped for their next stint...

51:09.248 --> 51:10.588
- Gonna get me seatbelt.

51:10.688 --> 51:11.388
It's okay.

51:11.488 --> 51:14.528
- [Chris] Despite the GT's
ongoing attempts to hold them up.

51:15.568 --> 51:17.268
- Oh, no.

51:17.368 --> 51:18.108
It's not having it.

51:18.208 --> 51:19.148
No.

51:19.248 --> 51:20.708
- Take your time.

51:20.808 --> 51:24.149
- [Chris] Before long,
they were back on the move.

51:24.249 --> 51:25.509
- All right, we're in.
- Are you in?

51:25.609 --> 51:27.609
- Let's go.
- All right!

51:30.329 --> 51:32.149
- [Chris] Team Lada, meanwhile,

51:32.249 --> 51:33.589
was bringing up the rear.

51:33.689 --> 51:35.749
Bit more gas, go, go, go, go, go, go.

51:35.849 --> 51:36.789
- I've got it.
- Get ready.

51:36.889 --> 51:39.449
- [Chris] But coming in fast.

51:41.089 --> 51:42.149
Whoa, what a stop!

51:42.249 --> 51:44.549
Right, now jump out and swap.
- Okay.

51:44.649 --> 51:47.210
(upbeat music)

51:49.290 --> 51:51.470
- Come on.

51:51.570 --> 51:52.470
- How are we looking?

51:52.570 --> 51:54.310
- We're going at 49 miles an hour.

51:54.410 --> 51:55.630
- 49?
- Yeah.

51:55.730 --> 51:57.990
- That's practically rapid in this.

51:58.090 --> 51:59.270
- Oh my god, my hair.

51:59.370 --> 52:00.350
- Lob it back, just lob it back there.

52:00.450 --> 52:01.210
Don't worry about your hair.

52:01.290 --> 52:02.190
- I've got hat hair.

52:02.290 --> 52:03.950
- At least you've got hair.

52:04.050 --> 52:04.910
- Yeah.
- Come on.

52:05.010 --> 52:07.010
Be sensitive for a minute.

52:09.290 --> 52:11.551
- Right, 1.5 miles on this road.

52:11.651 --> 52:12.791
- All right.

52:12.891 --> 52:13.791
- Bit of that.

52:13.891 --> 52:15.191
Oh, let's have it.

52:15.291 --> 52:16.511
- That's what we want.

52:16.611 --> 52:18.611
Here we go.

52:19.291 --> 52:21.911
- [Chris] Paddy Makkinen
and his new co-driver

52:22.011 --> 52:23.391
were right in the zone.

52:23.491 --> 52:25.711
- Till a right, 0.5 miles on this.

52:25.811 --> 52:27.871
- Good navigating, Heathcliff.

52:27.971 --> 52:30.671
- [Chris] And it looked like
the fight for first car glory

52:30.771 --> 52:33.491
would be between Britain and the USSR.

52:34.611 --> 52:36.232
- We're on the rev limiter.

52:36.332 --> 52:38.072
We're flying!
- Yeah, come on.

52:38.172 --> 52:40.172
- The Niva is flying!

52:41.612 --> 52:44.152
Especially as the Cornish countryside

52:44.252 --> 52:46.512
was now asking more and more questions

52:46.612 --> 52:49.112
of Fred's sluggish Beetle.

52:49.212 --> 52:51.112
- So the speed limit is 60
miles an hour on this road.

52:51.212 --> 52:52.632
- Not a chance I can get to 60.

52:52.732 --> 52:54.352
- What, this car can't reach 60?

52:54.452 --> 52:56.792
- No way, not a chance.

52:56.892 --> 52:58.512
It's got 50 horsepower.

52:58.612 --> 53:00.153
- Okay.
- That was when it was new.

53:00.253 --> 53:01.553
(upbeat music)

53:01.653 --> 53:03.993
- Now this is an experience.

53:04.093 --> 53:05.153
- Yeah, this is an experience.

53:05.253 --> 53:06.113
Look at the beautiful view.

53:06.213 --> 53:07.433
- I like this, you're on the map properly.

53:07.533 --> 53:08.633
- Embrace the scenery.

53:08.733 --> 53:10.313
In one mile we're going right.

53:10.413 --> 53:11.153
One mile.

53:11.253 --> 53:12.013
- Are you happy with your hair?

53:12.093 --> 53:12.853
- Yeah, and my hair's looking great.

53:12.933 --> 53:13.733
- Okay, good, do you want the mirror?

53:13.813 --> 53:14.953
Do you want the mirror?

53:15.053 --> 53:15.813
- Are you happy with your hair?

53:15.893 --> 53:17.633
Oh, well oh.

53:17.733 --> 53:20.993
- There's no need for any of that!

53:21.093 --> 53:22.273
- [Freddie] All right, so the other two

53:22.373 --> 53:25.354
might have been having
an easier run of it.

53:25.454 --> 53:28.274
- Right, five minutes, 1.8 miles.

53:28.374 --> 53:30.514
- What, to the destination?
- To the destination.

53:30.614 --> 53:32.554
- We are nailing it, pal.

53:32.654 --> 53:35.114
- But this is Cornwall.

53:35.214 --> 53:37.754
And just when you think
you're going well...

53:37.854 --> 53:39.434
- Come on, the Niva, come on, the Niva.

53:39.534 --> 53:40.234
Come on!

53:40.334 --> 53:41.994
- In 1.6 miles we're going right.

53:42.094 --> 53:44.114
That's in 1.6 miles.

53:44.214 --> 53:47.155
- [Freddie] You soon
realise you're never far...

53:47.255 --> 53:49.075
- Oh no.
- Jesus.

53:49.175 --> 53:50.795
- [Freddie] From a bit of holiday traffic.

53:50.895 --> 53:52.835
- Oh my lord.

53:52.935 --> 53:54.635
Look at this!

53:54.735 --> 53:55.995
Look at this!

53:56.095 --> 53:56.915
Come on!

53:57.015 --> 53:59.635
- [Paddy] The delays look costly.

53:59.735 --> 54:02.435
- You wouldn't expect it.
- Oh, my word.

54:02.535 --> 54:04.955
Or at least they would've
if the competition

54:05.055 --> 54:08.575
didn't still have their
own hills to conquer.

54:10.135 --> 54:12.136
- Oh my god!

54:13.656 --> 54:15.656
- It's gonna be noisy.
- Come on!

54:16.136 --> 54:19.036
Oh get up, oh get up!
- Get up the hill.

54:19.136 --> 54:20.036
- You can do it, little babes.

54:20.136 --> 54:20.916
Come on.

54:21.016 --> 54:21.756
- Come on.

54:21.856 --> 54:22.896
Can only go as fast as
the car I went with.

54:22.976 --> 54:24.516
- Come on, let's go!

54:24.616 --> 54:26.076
- Oh, come on, Sainaath.

54:26.176 --> 54:28.176
- Yay, ha ha ha.
- Yes! Come on!

54:29.136 --> 54:30.316
- Ooh.

54:30.416 --> 54:31.236
Ooh!

54:31.336 --> 54:33.156
Oh.

54:33.256 --> 54:35.717
Oh man, go on, look at the view.

54:35.817 --> 54:39.597
- The finish line was now
just a stone's throw away.

54:39.697 --> 54:41.517
- Oh, look at that for a view down there.

54:41.617 --> 54:42.997
Look at that.

54:43.097 --> 54:44.277
- I can smell the fish and chips already.

54:44.377 --> 54:46.157
- Oh, good lad.
- Great cran.

54:46.257 --> 54:48.157
- [Paddy] And with two
of us closing in fast...

54:48.257 --> 54:49.757
- Here.
- Left up here?

54:49.857 --> 54:51.477
- Yeah.
- We've smashed this.

54:51.577 --> 54:53.437
We have smashed this.
- We have.

54:53.537 --> 54:56.077
- Sadly for Team Beetle, it turned out

54:56.177 --> 54:59.958
that somewhere along the
sightseeing crawl of Newquay,

55:00.058 --> 55:02.338
he'd also gone the wrong way.

55:03.258 --> 55:05.258
- Is this the same road?

55:07.498 --> 55:08.838
- This is the same road here.

55:08.938 --> 55:10.598
- Yeah, and then left.

55:10.698 --> 55:11.798
- Left?
- Yeah.

55:11.898 --> 55:13.398
- Why did you take us that way?

55:13.498 --> 55:14.598
- Yeah, well.

55:14.698 --> 55:15.498
- Is that you that, taking your pictures?

55:15.578 --> 55:16.678
- Yeah, come on.

55:16.778 --> 55:19.538
I think the navigator told
me to go for a scenic route.

55:20.498 --> 55:22.719
- [Paddy] And that meant with a few extra

55:22.819 --> 55:26.439
valuable minutes lost, as the scenic route

55:26.539 --> 55:28.959
finally brought them
round to the finish line.

55:29.059 --> 55:29.799
- Yes!

55:29.899 --> 55:31.679
Ooh!

55:31.779 --> 55:33.239
Yes!

55:33.339 --> 55:35.919
- Team MG was right behind.

55:36.019 --> 55:38.019
- Hey!

55:38.459 --> 55:40.599
Good lad, Heathcliff!

55:40.699 --> 55:41.799
- [Heathcliff] Sorted.

55:41.899 --> 55:44.259
- Lads are here!
- Oh my word.

55:45.899 --> 55:47.400
How did you get here so fast?

55:47.500 --> 55:49.080
- Love that, Heathcliff.

55:49.180 --> 55:51.280
Some navigation there, pal.

55:51.380 --> 55:52.680
- Which way did you come?

55:52.780 --> 55:53.800
- The way it told us to go!

55:53.900 --> 55:55.000
- We did the scenic route.

55:55.100 --> 55:57.160
We went round that way
first and then came back.

55:57.260 --> 55:58.000
- Did you?

55:58.100 --> 55:58.840
Come.

55:58.940 --> 56:00.960
- Here we go.

56:01.060 --> 56:02.280
- Here's the gang.

56:02.380 --> 56:04.440
- Oh!

56:04.540 --> 56:05.280
- Hey!

56:05.380 --> 56:07.440
- Hey!

56:07.540 --> 56:09.540
Girl power!

56:10.141 --> 56:11.041
- Girl power.

56:11.141 --> 56:14.201
- I've gotta tell you, you
were not far behind us.

56:14.301 --> 56:15.041
- Smashed it.

56:15.141 --> 56:16.881
- I've got a feeling
you might have done it.

56:16.981 --> 56:18.001
- Well played.

56:18.101 --> 56:20.161
- Oh, hello there, thank you.

56:20.261 --> 56:22.081
- Right, okay.

56:22.181 --> 56:27.181
Freddie and Sainaath, 27
minutes and 12 seconds.

56:28.821 --> 56:30.761
- I think we're last here.

56:30.861 --> 56:35.862
- Chris and Charlotte, 21
minutes and 32 seconds.

56:37.382 --> 56:39.382
Which way did you go?

56:40.302 --> 56:43.522
So Chris and Charlotte,
21 minutes and 32 seconds.

56:43.622 --> 56:45.622
Paddy and Heathcliff...

56:46.182 --> 56:48.702
also 21 minutes and...

56:50.462 --> 56:52.462
28 seconds, son!

56:55.022 --> 56:56.882
- We got close.
- That's my boy!

56:56.982 --> 56:58.603
That's my boy!

56:58.703 --> 57:01.363
Hey, come on, get yourself in
there, son, you've earned it.

57:01.463 --> 57:03.283
Get in, big man.

57:03.383 --> 57:04.563
- That was good fun.

57:04.663 --> 57:07.283
- You'll be having a shave next, good lad.

57:07.383 --> 57:09.163
(audience applauding)

57:09.263 --> 57:11.263
- Ah, come on.

57:15.663 --> 57:17.603
- Good lad, Heathcliff.

57:17.703 --> 57:18.843
They were all great, weren't they?

57:18.943 --> 57:20.603
They were all great.

57:20.703 --> 57:23.604
So, we set out to find
cars for new drivers

57:23.704 --> 57:25.924
that were affordable and more interesting

57:26.024 --> 57:27.324
than a Vauxhall Corsa.

57:27.424 --> 57:28.484
I've gotta say, boys.

57:28.584 --> 57:29.364
I think we've nailed it.

57:29.464 --> 57:30.364
Cracking trio.

57:30.464 --> 57:31.484
- I have to stop you there, Pad.

57:31.584 --> 57:33.204
I admit they are brilliant.

57:33.304 --> 57:35.004
But I found a few issues with them.

57:35.104 --> 57:38.484
No ABS, no airbags, don't
steer straight, no brakes.

57:38.584 --> 57:40.244
- Sounds like me now.
- Yeah.

57:40.344 --> 57:41.084
- I have to on this one, Chris.

57:41.184 --> 57:42.764
I feel for this one.
(Chris laughs)

57:42.864 --> 57:45.004
Because the more I drove this,

57:45.104 --> 57:47.085
the more I realised there's not a chance

57:47.185 --> 57:48.565
I'm putting a child of mine in it.

57:48.665 --> 57:49.405
No way.

57:49.505 --> 57:50.545
- He's got a point, they're
charming, but they just serve

57:50.625 --> 57:53.165
to remind you how far
the motor car's come.

57:53.265 --> 57:54.005
- Correct.

57:54.105 --> 57:57.005
So, what we're saying is if
you've just passed your test

57:57.105 --> 57:59.805
and you want something
affordable to buy and insure,

57:59.905 --> 58:03.005
ignore everything we've
just said and get a Corsa.

58:03.105 --> 58:04.165
- Exactly.
- Correct.

58:04.265 --> 58:07.125
And that's it for the
show, and the series.

58:07.225 --> 58:08.045
What?

58:08.145 --> 58:09.085
(audience groaning)

58:09.185 --> 58:11.006
But don't worry, because
we'll be back very soon

58:11.106 --> 58:13.086
with a bonus Christmas episode.

58:13.186 --> 58:14.846
Ho-ho-hope to see you then.

58:14.946 --> 58:16.446
A little Christmas gag.

58:16.546 --> 58:17.286
Thanks for watching.

58:17.386 --> 58:18.166
Good night.

58:18.266 --> 58:23.266
(upbeat music)
(audience applauding)
