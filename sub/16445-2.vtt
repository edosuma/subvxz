WEBVTT

00:01.495 --> 00:03.808
- Previously on Gotham...
- I set a bomb.

00:03.834 --> 00:05.444
- Thousands of people could die.
- Yes.

00:05.482 --> 00:07.476
But paying that price will be better

00:07.502 --> 00:09.955
than releasing what's down there.

00:12.330 --> 00:14.264
Are you ready to play?!

00:14.332 --> 00:15.934
Wayne Enterprises runs Indian Hill,

00:15.972 --> 00:19.206
but who runs Wayne Enterprises?

00:19.231 --> 00:20.609
There's a secret council in Gotham.

00:20.633 --> 00:22.046
It's them that wanted me dead.

00:22.110 --> 00:24.167
We're so close to the ultimate truth.

00:26.972 --> 00:30.391
Strange, you did a very bad thing to me.

00:30.455 --> 00:32.677
And now, you're going to...

00:32.744 --> 00:35.079
Impossible.

00:35.147 --> 00:38.140
Nothing is impossible.

00:42.664 --> 00:43.865
Thank you.

00:43.891 --> 00:45.772
Bruce, I might not see you for a while.

00:45.810 --> 00:48.027
- Where are you going?
- I have to find Lee.

Hello?

01:56.830 --> 01:58.374
We're closed.

02:03.437 --> 02:05.104
If you leave now,

02:05.172 --> 02:07.206
I won't call the cops.

02:36.245 --> 02:37.919
Hey.

02:39.892 --> 02:42.108
Any chance you want to come quietly?

03:05.038 --> 03:06.672
Ow.

03:44.644 --> 03:46.728
At 8:15 this evening,

03:46.792 --> 03:50.149
an individual robbed a pharmacy
and attacked its owner.

03:50.217 --> 03:52.518
While we don't have an I.D. as yet,

03:52.586 --> 03:56.155
we believe this individual is
another escapee from Indian Hill.

03:59.826 --> 04:01.994
Are these monsters dangerous?

04:02.062 --> 04:03.596
Captain Barnes! Captain Barnes!

04:03.663 --> 04:05.131
Valerie Vale, Gotham Gazette.

04:05.198 --> 04:07.266
Why can't we see the escapee?

04:07.334 --> 04:09.235
Because crews are still
picking up the pieces.

04:09.302 --> 04:10.536
This isn't the first time

04:10.604 --> 04:13.205
that a bounty hunter has
apprehended an escapee.

04:13.273 --> 04:14.440
Is the GCPD incapable

04:14.508 --> 04:16.375
of handling this threat themselves?

04:16.442 --> 04:19.144
Whoa, only a handful of these
escapees have been brought in

04:19.212 --> 04:20.713
by bounty hunters.

04:20.781 --> 04:23.015
The vast majority were
apprehended by GCPD.

04:23.083 --> 04:25.284
Excuse me. Excuse me.

04:25.352 --> 04:27.586
I take issue with the word "threat."

04:27.654 --> 04:30.956
These escapees are themselves

04:31.024 --> 04:32.958
victims of Hugo Strange.

04:33.026 --> 04:35.294
Now, if any ordinary
hard-working citizen

04:35.362 --> 04:38.130
wants to help get these
poor souls off the street

04:38.198 --> 04:40.533
so that they may receive
proper treatment,

04:40.600 --> 04:43.235
well, these citizens should be lauded

04:43.303 --> 04:44.470
and rewarded financially.

04:44.538 --> 04:46.705
Mr. James, before they
were taken to Indian Hill,

04:46.773 --> 04:49.008
these "poor souls" were all
criminally insane inmates

04:49.075 --> 04:51.811
at Arkham Asylum, were they not?

04:53.046 --> 04:54.380
Next question.

04:54.447 --> 04:57.249
Hear that? You should be lauded.

04:57.317 --> 04:58.684
I'll settle for the cash.

04:58.752 --> 05:00.286
How many escapees you brought in now?

05:00.353 --> 05:02.555
- Hmm? Six?
- Five grand a pop?

05:02.622 --> 05:03.989
That's not too bad.

05:04.057 --> 05:06.292
What happens when there aren't any more?

05:06.359 --> 05:08.471
I don't think Gotham's running
out of monsters anytime soon.

05:08.495 --> 05:11.230
I really can't get
you to come back, huh?

05:11.298 --> 05:13.209
Look, whatever happened
when you went to see Lee,

05:13.233 --> 05:15.568
and you know I don't like to pry...

05:15.635 --> 05:17.036
Sure you don't.

05:17.103 --> 05:18.447
That's because you
won't tell me anything.

05:18.471 --> 05:20.940
The whole point is man's
not supposed to be alone.

05:21.007 --> 05:23.509
- You have a family here.
- Can't do it, Harv.

05:23.577 --> 05:26.287
But you got no problem
chasing down Strange's freaks?

05:26.299 --> 05:27.475
Yeah, it pays the rent.

05:27.526 --> 05:30.249
You are a cop in everything but name.

05:30.317 --> 05:32.451
Yeah, except I don't
have to listen to Barnes.

05:32.519 --> 05:35.221
I get to go home when I
want, get drunk when I want.

05:35.288 --> 05:37.623
And at the end of the day, I sleep.

05:37.691 --> 05:40.559
'Cause saving Gotham's
not my job anymore.

05:40.627 --> 05:42.127
Jim, I love you like a brother,

05:42.195 --> 05:44.463
but you've got to stop blaming the job

05:44.531 --> 05:46.832
for what happened between you and Lee.

05:46.900 --> 05:48.767
And do you really

05:48.835 --> 05:50.936
think I don't get drunk when I want?

05:53.373 --> 05:54.573
Detective Bullock?

05:54.641 --> 05:56.152
I looked into the drug
the escapee was after.

05:56.176 --> 05:58.410
It's a powerful immune suppressant.

05:58.478 --> 05:59.578
Gordon.

05:59.646 --> 06:00.779
See, look at Lucius here.

06:00.847 --> 06:03.782
Our new resident expert
on all things scientific.

06:03.850 --> 06:05.818
He said sayonara to
the Wayne Enterprises

06:05.886 --> 06:08.320
robots, hmm, and he loves it here.

06:09.789 --> 06:12.558
Wayne Enterprises revealed
itself as morally corrupt.

06:12.626 --> 06:15.694
Here, despite the primitive facilities,

06:15.762 --> 06:18.430
casual violence, fascistic
meathead culture...

06:18.498 --> 06:19.665
Lucius?

06:19.733 --> 06:21.133
I love it.

06:21.201 --> 06:22.434
Anyway,

06:22.502 --> 06:24.703
that drug is only sold at
three pharmacies in the city,

06:24.771 --> 06:27.291
and the other two pharmacies were
both robbed in the last month.

06:27.340 --> 06:28.674
The question is

06:28.742 --> 06:31.176
why are Indian Hill escapees
now robbing pharmacies?

06:31.244 --> 06:32.478
Good question.

06:32.545 --> 06:34.813
So, what do you say just
like the old days you

06:34.881 --> 06:36.548
and me run it together... Huh, partner?

06:36.616 --> 06:38.651
You get a hard lead on an escapee

06:38.718 --> 06:41.487
and the price is right,
I'll bring him in.

06:41.554 --> 06:43.355
Thanks for the drink.

06:43.423 --> 06:45.758
Lucius.

06:45.825 --> 06:47.826
"Fascistic meathead culture"?

06:47.894 --> 06:50.496
I mean, you couldn't try to be
just a little bit more positive?

06:50.563 --> 06:52.748
- I was very positive.
- Uh-huh.

06:54.256 --> 06:56.033
Why is Hugo Strange the only
one that's been arrested?

06:56.057 --> 06:57.602
- The situation...
- And what about the rumors

06:57.626 --> 06:59.003
that Indian Hill is a
Wayne Enterprises facility?

06:59.027 --> 07:01.495
And how many more of these
escapees are at large?

07:01.563 --> 07:03.441
- Are we talking 20? 30?
- Excuse me, excuse me...

07:03.465 --> 07:04.509
Just give me a blink if I'm close.

07:04.533 --> 07:07.535
The situation is firmly in hand.

07:07.602 --> 07:08.869
Liar!

07:10.472 --> 07:12.940
Oh, no.

07:13.008 --> 07:16.277
My name is Oswald Cobblepot.

07:16.344 --> 07:18.679
We know who you are, Penguin.

07:18.747 --> 07:20.014
What do you want?

07:20.081 --> 07:22.516
What do I want?

07:22.584 --> 07:26.086
I want you to tell the truth
to the people of Gotham.

07:26.154 --> 07:28.589
They would have us believe
that there is no danger.

07:28.657 --> 07:31.158
But I was there the night

07:31.226 --> 07:33.260
those creatures broke
out of Indian Hill.

07:33.328 --> 07:35.262
I saw them.

07:35.330 --> 07:38.098
And I saw who's leading them.

07:38.166 --> 07:39.677
Are saying the escapees are organized?

07:39.701 --> 07:42.336
Hello! That is what I am saying.

07:42.404 --> 07:45.072
There is absolutely
nothing to support that.

07:45.140 --> 07:46.540
I told the police who to look for.

07:46.608 --> 07:49.043
I begged them time and again.

07:49.110 --> 07:51.712
And they have done

07:51.780 --> 07:53.514
nothing.

07:53.582 --> 07:56.350
And so I am here

07:56.418 --> 07:59.453
to speak directly to the good people

07:59.521 --> 08:02.089
of Gotham.

08:02.157 --> 08:05.826
The enemy's name is Fish Mooney.

08:05.894 --> 08:08.429
"Fish Mooney"? She hasn't been spotted

08:08.496 --> 08:10.164
for over six months.

08:10.232 --> 08:13.133
She's either long gone or she's dead.

08:14.273 --> 08:16.737
I wish I shared your simple belief.

08:18.257 --> 08:19.773
She is a criminal.

08:19.841 --> 08:22.610
She is a murderer.

08:22.677 --> 08:24.278
And now God knows what kind of monster

08:24.346 --> 08:26.247
Hugo Strange has turned her into.

08:26.314 --> 08:29.683
I implore every citizen of Gotham,

08:29.751 --> 08:31.685
if you love your family,

08:31.753 --> 08:34.587
if you love your children,

08:34.655 --> 08:37.725
find Fish Mooney.

08:37.792 --> 08:41.395
Until then, no one is safe.

08:52.274 --> 08:54.341
Hello, Jim.

08:54.409 --> 08:56.410
Oswald.

08:56.478 --> 08:58.913
I'm surprised you haven't found Mooney.

08:58.980 --> 09:01.982
I hear you're quite the
bounty hunter these days.

09:03.919 --> 09:07.288
You haven't made it worth my while.

09:07.355 --> 09:08.555
Oh.

09:08.623 --> 09:10.224
Tough guy now.

09:10.292 --> 09:12.626
But he makes a point.

09:43.258 --> 09:45.092
Ozzy.

09:45.160 --> 09:46.727
Butch.

09:46.795 --> 09:49.463
What a nice surprise.

09:49.531 --> 09:51.799
Forgive me for not coming sooner.

09:51.866 --> 09:54.201
The place looks marvelous!

09:55.337 --> 09:58.439
- Wouldn't you say so, Butch?
- Yeah, place looks great.

09:58.506 --> 09:59.984
I imagine you're here about your offer.

10:00.008 --> 10:02.609
To let us shelter under your umbrella?

10:02.677 --> 10:04.278
I only want what's best for you.

10:04.346 --> 10:05.579
I appreciate the thought.

10:05.647 --> 10:08.182
But... we're big girls.

10:08.249 --> 10:09.350
We can handle ourselves.

10:10.251 --> 10:11.652
Can't we?

10:12.620 --> 10:13.921
Sure we can.

10:13.989 --> 10:15.656
Hey, Butch.

10:17.325 --> 10:18.993
Hey, h-h-how you doing?

10:19.060 --> 10:20.894
You taking care of yourself?

10:20.962 --> 10:22.696
Y-Yeah, yeah.

10:22.764 --> 10:25.299
So, uh, so how you doing?

10:25.367 --> 10:27.234
You already asked her that.

10:27.302 --> 10:28.602
Listen.

10:28.670 --> 10:30.704
You guys should take
him up on his offer.

10:30.772 --> 10:32.706
Gotham's full of rough characters.

10:33.608 --> 10:35.409
You look great by the way.

10:36.878 --> 10:38.212
Wait over there.

10:38.279 --> 10:39.313
Please.

10:41.282 --> 10:42.549
Poor bunny.

10:42.617 --> 10:44.763
Break-ups are hard.

10:45.587 --> 10:46.987
I offered to kill you.

10:47.055 --> 10:49.623
I thought it would raise his spirits.

10:49.691 --> 10:52.693
It would be my pleasure seeing
as how you murdered my mother!

10:52.761 --> 10:54.428
But he is nursing

10:54.496 --> 10:57.498
some foolish hope that you
two will get back together.

10:58.867 --> 11:00.567
Love.

11:00.635 --> 11:02.275
You can take your offer
and stick it up...

11:02.337 --> 11:03.737
We'll think about it, Ozzy.

11:05.607 --> 11:07.007
Fine.

11:07.075 --> 11:08.776
But that's not the only reason I'm here.

11:08.843 --> 11:10.544
Spread the word.

11:10.612 --> 11:12.780
I want Fish Mooney.

11:13.615 --> 11:15.055
And I will give a million dollars...

11:16.217 --> 11:17.951
to whoever can bring her to me.

11:18.019 --> 11:20.020
Dead...

11:20.088 --> 11:21.755
or alive.

11:21.823 --> 11:23.690
Chopped into pieces.

11:26.094 --> 11:27.828
I want her.

11:33.935 --> 11:35.335
You okay, Butch?

11:36.638 --> 11:37.971
World getting you down?

11:38.039 --> 11:40.407
Yeah, I'm fine, kid.

11:40.475 --> 11:42.076
And you're too young to be in here.

11:42.143 --> 11:44.211
- Scram.
- Jeesh.

11:44.279 --> 11:46.613
Just trying to be nice.

11:48.917 --> 11:51.351
Just seeing her kills me, you know?

11:54.122 --> 11:55.456
Get over it.

11:55.523 --> 11:57.825
And that child just stole your wallet.

12:03.431 --> 12:05.866
Hey, Barbara and that whip lady

12:05.934 --> 12:08.168
are gonna get angry you
stealing from their customers.

12:08.236 --> 12:11.004
Let them. I got other things going.

12:11.072 --> 12:13.240
- Like what?
- Top secret.

12:13.308 --> 12:14.741
Let's eat; I'm starving.

12:14.809 --> 12:16.243
Hey, kid.

12:16.311 --> 12:19.246
Take it. It's yours.

12:19.314 --> 12:22.049
Keep feeding strays, one's
gonna follow you home.

12:22.117 --> 12:23.951
Like you?

12:31.382 --> 12:34.583
Well, that should be the last of it.

12:34.651 --> 12:36.585
I'll put the kettle on.

12:36.653 --> 12:38.420
There's nothing like a sweet cup of tea

12:38.488 --> 12:41.156
to make home feel like home
after a long trip away.

12:41.224 --> 12:43.091
Hey, Master Bruce?

12:45.461 --> 12:47.296
You all right?

12:52.101 --> 12:54.503
Were we right to leave, Alfred?

12:54.570 --> 12:56.171
Stay away all this time?

12:56.239 --> 12:58.317
Well, considering the
appalling sight of the topiary,

12:58.341 --> 13:00.008
I should say absolutely bloody not.

13:00.076 --> 13:02.044
Alfred, you know what I mean.

13:03.513 --> 13:05.781
I know you know why we left.

13:06.849 --> 13:09.051
We had to leave.

13:09.118 --> 13:11.153
You're nervous about
tomorrow, aren't you?

13:11.220 --> 13:12.888
- Yes.
- Well, you wouldn't

13:12.956 --> 13:14.556
be human if you weren't.

13:14.624 --> 13:16.268
So, why don't you go
through there, take a pew.

13:16.292 --> 13:18.393
Pop your feet up,

13:18.461 --> 13:20.595
and I'll see about
that lovely cup of tea.

13:20.663 --> 13:22.097
All right?

13:40.516 --> 13:42.584
Saving that for someone special?

13:48.591 --> 13:50.258
Coffee, please.

13:52.495 --> 13:54.763
"Search continues for new
Arkham Asylum director."

13:54.831 --> 13:56.331
Right.

13:56.399 --> 13:58.567
Good luck finding
anyone to take that job.

13:58.634 --> 14:00.369
I'm Valerie Vale.

14:00.436 --> 14:02.804
- Reporter for The Gazette.
- I know who you are.

14:02.872 --> 14:04.306
And you're James Gordon.

14:04.374 --> 14:06.208
Son of a respected Gotham D.A.

14:06.275 --> 14:08.577
Former war hero. Former
white knight cop.

14:08.644 --> 14:10.545
Now bounty hunter.

14:10.613 --> 14:12.124
You know, someone should
do a story on you.

14:12.148 --> 14:16.518
- Eh, not interested.
- Yeah, me neither, actually.

14:16.586 --> 14:18.163
You were there that
night, at Indian Hill.

14:18.187 --> 14:20.188
- I got nothing to say.
- What about the fact

14:20.256 --> 14:22.791
that besides Hugo Strange
and his assistant,

14:22.859 --> 14:24.359
no one else has been arrested?

14:24.427 --> 14:27.321
Or that despite everything
pointing to Wayne Enterprises,

14:27.359 --> 14:29.761
there seems to be zero investigation.

14:29.828 --> 14:31.262
You're new to Gotham, aren't you?

14:31.330 --> 14:32.363
Okay, this is where

14:32.431 --> 14:33.908
you tell me things
work differently here?

14:33.932 --> 14:35.800
I'm not from Gotham, but my dad's a cop.

14:35.868 --> 14:36.868
My brothers are cops.

14:36.902 --> 14:38.636
And things work the same everywhere.

14:38.704 --> 14:41.306
I was going to say it's
hard to find a quiet bar

14:41.373 --> 14:42.473
in the city.

14:42.541 --> 14:43.775
I like coming here.

14:43.842 --> 14:45.910
Please don't make me find another.

14:45.978 --> 14:48.446
Now, do you think Cobblepot's right?

14:48.514 --> 14:50.448
That Fish Mooney's
organizing the escapees?

14:50.516 --> 14:52.750
Penguin is a liar and a murderer.

14:52.818 --> 14:55.386
Hmm... but...

14:56.455 --> 14:58.289
But based on the escapees,

14:58.357 --> 14:59.657
and knowing Fish...

15:01.026 --> 15:03.094
I hope not.

15:05.431 --> 15:07.298
Well...

15:07.366 --> 15:10.234
he's offering a million dollars
to whoever brings her in.

15:12.215 --> 15:13.570
You're welcome.

15:36.061 --> 15:37.395
It's a puzzle.

15:38.464 --> 15:40.485
The trick is opening it.

15:40.754 --> 15:41.891
The man at the store said

15:41.929 --> 15:44.035
it's one of the most
difficult ever made.

15:44.103 --> 15:46.037
People pass it down unsolved

15:46.105 --> 15:47.338
for generations.

15:49.641 --> 15:51.909
A mathematician once went mad trying...

15:56.081 --> 15:57.415
Yes.

15:57.483 --> 15:58.683
Well,

15:58.751 --> 16:00.118
there you go.

16:00.185 --> 16:02.253
It was a lovely thought.

16:04.723 --> 16:05.867
And did you got the biscuits?

16:05.891 --> 16:07.658
A-And the sweater?

16:07.726 --> 16:08.937
I-I know how drafty these rooms are.

16:08.961 --> 16:10.561
- Mr. Penguin.
- Oswald.

16:10.629 --> 16:12.240
When I think of how I
treated you... Stop.

16:12.264 --> 16:15.366
Why are you being so kind?

16:15.434 --> 16:20.571
Talking to you these past months,

16:20.639 --> 16:23.074
I don't know how I would've
gotten by otherwise.

16:25.043 --> 16:27.278
With Fish out there
planning who knows what...

16:29.615 --> 16:32.049
Me being surrounded by
morons and lunatics.

16:32.117 --> 16:33.751
I know the feeling.

16:37.089 --> 16:38.956
Why didn't she kill me
when she had the chance?

16:40.659 --> 16:42.029
I was powerless.

16:42.885 --> 16:45.096
She must have a larger goal.

16:45.164 --> 16:47.465
I-I need to know what she is doing.

16:47.533 --> 16:49.333
Do you?

16:56.842 --> 16:59.844
When Alexander encountered
the Gordian knot,

16:59.912 --> 17:02.947
a knot so complex no one had
ever been able to untangle it...

17:06.952 --> 17:10.821
he just removed his
sword and cut it in two.

17:10.888 --> 17:12.957
Details can be distracting.

17:13.025 --> 17:14.224
Sometimes...

17:16.127 --> 17:18.162
a simple solution is best.

17:18.230 --> 17:21.299
See, no matter what she is planning,

17:21.366 --> 17:22.767
just remember...

17:26.972 --> 17:29.407
penguins...

17:29.475 --> 17:30.408
eat...

17:30.476 --> 17:32.677
fish.

18:11.483 --> 18:13.384
You know why we're here.

18:16.955 --> 18:19.490
- What are you doing here?
- Stop.

18:19.558 --> 18:21.726
Stop...

18:31.403 --> 18:34.005
So what are we after?

18:34.072 --> 18:36.173
It's not like they keep cash around.

18:36.241 --> 18:38.175
For now, survival. GUARD: Don't move!

18:39.545 --> 18:41.546
Hands.

18:43.015 --> 18:44.482
Hands.

18:47.753 --> 18:49.186
Of course.

18:55.594 --> 18:57.128
Drop the gun.

19:00.666 --> 19:02.266
Now knock yourself out.

19:07.339 --> 19:09.707
That was awesome. How did you...

19:10.742 --> 19:13.544
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa, Fish.

19:13.612 --> 19:15.179
I'm fine.

19:15.247 --> 19:16.914
Watch the door.

19:21.486 --> 19:23.487
Yeah, that's the only
company that makes the drug.

19:23.555 --> 19:25.590
Gray Pharma.

19:25.657 --> 19:27.001
They actually have a
warehouse here in Gotham.

19:27.025 --> 19:28.426
You think they could be a target?

19:28.493 --> 19:30.828
Well, they're the only
pharmacy that carries the drug.

19:30.896 --> 19:33.230
If somebody wants it, they'll
have to go to the source.

19:33.298 --> 19:35.366
Let me find the address.

19:35.434 --> 19:37.268
That's all right.

19:59.391 --> 20:01.559
James Gordon.

20:01.627 --> 20:03.160
Hands where I can see them.

20:03.228 --> 20:06.130
So, what?

20:06.198 --> 20:09.066
You're here to collect the
bounty Penguin has over my head?

20:09.134 --> 20:11.902
What is it, a million dollars?

20:11.970 --> 20:14.739
And to think I let that punk live.

20:14.806 --> 20:16.374
Well, then,

20:16.441 --> 20:19.910
I think you better cuff me.

20:19.978 --> 20:21.912
Cuff yourself.

20:23.482 --> 20:25.282
How many others you have with you?

20:25.350 --> 20:26.884
They're all with me.

20:26.952 --> 20:28.919
Every wretched soul

20:28.987 --> 20:31.422
that Hugo Strange experimented on.

20:31.490 --> 20:32.690
But tonight,

20:32.758 --> 20:34.158
just him.

21:22.271 --> 21:23.671
Did you hear them rats last night?

21:23.739 --> 21:26.074
Scurrying around in the attic,
driving me bloody bonkers.

21:26.141 --> 21:28.276
I'm gonna ask you,

21:28.343 --> 21:29.487
what's the point of having a caretaker,

21:29.511 --> 21:31.646
if they can't take care of nothing, aye?

21:33.744 --> 21:34.978
You all right, Master B?

21:35.046 --> 21:36.746
Hungry.

21:37.815 --> 21:39.535
- I should've eaten.
- Excuse me, gentlemen.

21:47.029 --> 21:49.023
I do this, there's no turning back.

21:50.722 --> 21:51.834
No.

21:53.664 --> 21:55.298
You say your piece.

21:57.097 --> 21:59.628
We'll see about getting you a
proper breakfast, all right?

22:13.231 --> 22:16.600
I'd like to thank the board
for giving me this time.

22:17.668 --> 22:19.336
It will come as no surprise

22:19.403 --> 22:21.638
I'd like to talk about Indian Hill.

22:21.706 --> 22:24.207
I know preliminary
investigations have concluded

22:24.275 --> 22:26.443
Hugo Strange acted alone.

22:26.773 --> 22:29.379
I reject this conclusion.

22:30.454 --> 22:32.455
While trapped in Indian
Hill, I was led to believe

22:32.522 --> 22:35.424
an unnamed group had taken
control of my company,

22:35.492 --> 22:37.993
and it was they who hired Hugo Strange.

22:38.061 --> 22:39.495
I left Gotham

22:39.563 --> 22:41.130
both for my own safety and so that

22:41.198 --> 22:42.975
I might have the time to
discover hard evidence

22:42.999 --> 22:45.334
of their existence.

22:45.402 --> 22:49.338
A conspiracy theory?
That's why we're all here?

22:49.406 --> 22:50.973
Excuse me, Master Bruce.

22:51.041 --> 22:54.076
Pardon me, sir, might I
have your name, please?

22:54.144 --> 22:57.747
- What?
- Your name... please, sir.

22:59.625 --> 23:00.625
Crowley.

23:00.664 --> 23:04.286
Mr. Crowley, did your parents
ever teach you any manners?

23:04.354 --> 23:06.689
I don't have to listen to this.

23:06.757 --> 23:08.724
Oh, but you do, sir!

23:08.792 --> 23:12.061
That is precisely the
point that I am making.

23:13.323 --> 23:15.100
I know how it sounds.

23:16.900 --> 23:20.102
But I now have proof they exist.

23:21.304 --> 23:23.566
And I can tell you that they're here.

23:24.708 --> 23:27.643
In this room.

23:31.712 --> 23:33.616
I want to talk face to face.

23:33.683 --> 23:36.118
You have 24 hours to contact
me, or the information

23:36.186 --> 23:38.154
that I've gathered will
be sent to every newspaper

23:38.221 --> 23:39.555
and television station in Gotham.

23:41.324 --> 23:43.659
Thank you for your time.

23:48.598 --> 23:50.466
Pancakes?

23:50.534 --> 23:52.268
Pancakes.

23:58.275 --> 24:00.209
And how did the board react?

24:01.511 --> 24:03.679
Then he leaves us no choice.

24:09.886 --> 24:11.420
Bruce Wayne.

24:12.456 --> 24:14.457
Do it quietly.

24:42.486 --> 24:44.887
- You Barbara Kean?
- We're closed.

24:47.958 --> 24:49.592
What?

24:49.659 --> 24:52.394
You built this club on our territory.

24:52.462 --> 24:55.998
We let you, 'cause we heard
Penguin had your back.

24:56.066 --> 24:58.534
- And now we hear that ain't so.
- Oh.

24:59.569 --> 25:02.137
Bad for you; good for us.

25:03.874 --> 25:05.007
Get the hell out.

25:06.743 --> 25:08.577
This place is ours now.

25:08.645 --> 25:09.979
Do you understand?

25:10.046 --> 25:11.146
You can't just come...

25:12.148 --> 25:13.582
Don't hit me, okay? Please.

25:48.618 --> 25:50.119
Hey. Hey.

25:50.186 --> 25:52.488
You still paying for stuff
about the Indian Hill freaks?

25:52.556 --> 25:54.123
Depends.

25:54.190 --> 25:55.658
If it's good.

25:55.725 --> 25:58.294
Is Fish Mooney good?

26:09.506 --> 26:11.840
- Guess I'm finding a new bar.
- I heard you ran into

26:11.908 --> 26:13.208
Fish Mooney yesterday.

26:13.276 --> 26:14.910
- So?
- So...

26:14.978 --> 26:16.645
are you still interested in finding her?

26:16.713 --> 26:19.114
Every cop in the city's
looking for her now.

26:19.182 --> 26:22.284
But I know where she's gonna be next.

26:22.352 --> 26:24.787
- Why are you telling me?
- You see,

26:24.854 --> 26:26.522
I need something from the cops.

26:26.590 --> 26:29.124
They're not gonna tell me,
but Bullock still trusts you.

26:29.192 --> 26:31.260
And you want me to lie to him.

26:31.328 --> 26:33.629
A million dollars covers a lot of sins.

26:33.697 --> 26:36.198
And obviously, I get to come along.

26:36.266 --> 26:38.434
Aw. Don't tell me you have a conscience.

26:38.501 --> 26:39.635
Yeah, all right.

26:46.643 --> 26:48.978
Jimmy, hey. So...

26:49.045 --> 26:51.246
after your run-in with Fish,

26:51.314 --> 26:53.292
Barnes had us up all night,
rousting her old hideouts.

26:53.316 --> 26:55.217
- Yeah. Did you find anything?
- Nada.

26:55.285 --> 26:57.620
But I did get what you asked for.

26:57.687 --> 26:59.788
Want to tell me what this is about?

26:59.856 --> 27:01.724
It's a hunch. Probably nothing.

27:01.791 --> 27:03.536
Well, if you got a hot lead
you don't want to share

27:03.560 --> 27:04.960
so you can collect Penguin's money,

27:04.995 --> 27:06.261
I got no problem with that.

27:06.329 --> 27:08.731
Just don't get yourself
killed or me fired, okay?

27:08.798 --> 27:10.766
I'll do my best. Hey,
get some rest, huh?

27:14.771 --> 27:16.772
Hey.

27:23.313 --> 27:25.414
When'd you get back?

27:25.482 --> 27:26.949
A couple days ago.

27:28.618 --> 27:30.219
I tried to find you before I left.

27:30.286 --> 27:31.687
No worries.

27:31.755 --> 27:35.457
You remember what I discovered
that night at Indian Hill?

27:35.525 --> 27:37.603
That there was a secret group
that infiltrated my company.

27:37.627 --> 27:39.795
I wasn't paying attention.

27:39.863 --> 27:42.297
I needed time to research
them. I couldn't do it here.

27:42.365 --> 27:43.832
Okay.

27:43.900 --> 27:45.344
I have a plan, but these
people are powerful.

27:45.368 --> 27:47.703
We need to assume they
know you and I are friends.

27:47.771 --> 27:48.871
You need to be careful.

27:48.938 --> 27:49.938
- Got it.
- I'm serious.

27:50.006 --> 27:51.940
I can see that!

27:55.278 --> 27:57.946
I'm sorry I was gone for so long.

27:58.014 --> 27:59.648
Don't apologize.

27:59.716 --> 28:01.617
Shoot, if I could fly to Italy

28:01.685 --> 28:03.919
and eat pizza all day, I would, too.

28:03.987 --> 28:06.155
- Switzerland.
- Italy's better.

28:06.222 --> 28:08.924
- Selina...
- Bruce, seriously...

28:08.992 --> 28:10.793
don't sweat it.

28:10.860 --> 28:12.961
I got to go.

28:13.029 --> 28:15.931
I'll see you around.

28:17.100 --> 28:19.835
Good to see you, Selina.

28:34.863 --> 28:36.964
- Hey, did you get it?
- Yeah.

28:37.031 --> 28:39.409
She's under guard in a
building on Douglas and 80th.

28:39.473 --> 28:41.140
There's one thing, though.

28:41.808 --> 28:43.342
Hey. Hey!

28:43.410 --> 28:44.844
What the hell are you doing?!

28:44.911 --> 28:46.222
You're 100 yards from a police station.

28:46.246 --> 28:47.913
I'll be back in an hour or two.

28:47.981 --> 28:49.181
We had a deal.

28:49.249 --> 28:51.183
If there's a story, I'll
make sure you get it.

28:51.251 --> 28:52.752
Oh, you're a son of a bitch.

28:52.819 --> 28:54.197
Also, you could scream,
but then you'd have

28:54.221 --> 28:55.264
to tell the cops everything.

28:55.288 --> 28:57.456
And you'd lose the story entirely.

28:57.524 --> 28:58.524
Gordon.

28:58.592 --> 29:00.259
Gordon!

29:00.327 --> 29:02.995
Son of a bitch!

29:15.375 --> 29:17.777
47... this is dispatch.

29:17.844 --> 29:18.978
This is 47.

29:19.046 --> 29:20.323
Report to Captain Barnes immediately.

29:20.347 --> 29:22.648
Relief team will take
your place. Over and out.

29:22.716 --> 29:25.985
You got it. We're out of here.

29:55.749 --> 29:57.283
I knocked.

29:57.350 --> 29:59.118
I didn't answer.

29:59.186 --> 30:00.920
You alone?

30:00.987 --> 30:02.688
All day, every day.

30:02.756 --> 30:06.292
I wasn't expecting
Jim Gordon to stop by.

30:06.359 --> 30:09.595
You aren't supposed to be here, are you?

30:09.663 --> 30:11.897
How come you're not in jail?

30:11.965 --> 30:15.351
I agreed to testify
against Professor Strange.

30:15.936 --> 30:17.236
In case you're about to ask,

30:17.304 --> 30:19.939
I don't know who really ran Indian Hill.

30:20.006 --> 30:22.875
I don't care who ran Indian Hill.

30:22.943 --> 30:24.910
Then why are you here?

30:27.314 --> 30:28.781
Fish Mooney.

30:28.849 --> 30:32.485
And why would I know
how to find Fish Mooney?

30:32.552 --> 30:34.153
No reason you would.

30:34.221 --> 30:36.355
But it's clear whatever
you and Strange did to her

30:36.423 --> 30:37.756
is making her sick.

30:37.824 --> 30:40.759
Her people are stealing drugs.

30:40.827 --> 30:42.038
But I don't think they're working.

30:42.062 --> 30:43.696
She's gonna come after you.

30:43.763 --> 30:45.898
Or her goons will.

30:45.966 --> 30:48.000
And they'll lead me to her.

30:48.068 --> 30:49.268
And how will they find me?

30:49.336 --> 30:51.370
Only the police are supposed to know.

30:51.438 --> 30:54.573
My guess... she'll have someone
get the information for her.

30:54.641 --> 30:57.376
Someone who wouldn't suspect being used.

30:57.444 --> 31:00.012
Maybe a reporter.

31:04.451 --> 31:06.986
She'll follow that person or whoever

31:07.053 --> 31:08.888
she goes to for help.

31:08.955 --> 31:10.756
In this case, a bounty hunter.

31:10.824 --> 31:12.057
Right...

31:12.125 --> 31:13.826
to you.

31:16.763 --> 31:18.264
You led them to me on purpose.

31:18.331 --> 31:20.733
You're using me as bait.

31:20.800 --> 31:22.668
I don't like being played.

31:22.736 --> 31:24.637
Plus she's worth a million dollars.

31:48.028 --> 31:50.362
No! Gordon! Help!

31:50.430 --> 31:52.131
Somebody help!

32:41.804 --> 32:43.338
I don't know, which one of you

32:43.405 --> 32:45.573
I want to bat over the
head with this cane more.

32:45.641 --> 32:48.142
I get it.

32:48.210 --> 32:50.378
Life disappointed you.

32:50.446 --> 32:52.981
So what? Does that make you special?

32:53.048 --> 32:54.616
I'm done with you.

32:54.683 --> 32:57.406
You cross me again, I will
have you skinned alive

32:57.457 --> 32:59.420
and your head put on a pike.

32:59.488 --> 33:01.823
And you,

33:01.890 --> 33:03.763
when I came back,

33:03.853 --> 33:07.195
and saw the way you handled
things while I was away,

33:07.262 --> 33:09.489
I swear, I had this feeling right here.

33:10.435 --> 33:12.000
I thought I was having a heart attack.

33:12.067 --> 33:14.335
But it was pride, Bullock.

33:14.403 --> 33:15.803
In you.

33:15.871 --> 33:17.864
The next time I have that feeling,

33:18.746 --> 33:21.042
I'll know it was just gas.

33:22.544 --> 33:25.380
You both better pray that we find her.

33:26.697 --> 33:27.937
Get out of my sight.

33:36.425 --> 33:38.393
I'd say that went well.

33:38.460 --> 33:41.025
He was right though.
About me being Captain.

33:41.383 --> 33:43.251
I did a good job. I even liked it.

33:43.319 --> 33:45.920
Yeah. Hey, look, I'm sorry, Harvey.

33:45.988 --> 33:47.822
I'll do my best to find Peabody.

33:47.890 --> 33:49.657
Honestly, Jim,

33:49.725 --> 33:51.593
for the time being, I think

33:51.660 --> 33:53.995
it might be better if you just...

33:54.063 --> 33:55.296
stayed away.

33:56.332 --> 33:58.333
Hey. Hey!

34:00.803 --> 34:04.105
- Ow.
- Just tell me, did you know?

34:04.173 --> 34:05.673
Did I know what?

34:05.741 --> 34:07.085
That Mooney was using
us to find Peabody.

34:07.109 --> 34:08.775
You mean using you?

34:08.844 --> 34:10.445
Yeah, it's her kind of play.

34:10.512 --> 34:11.980
You should've told me.

34:12.047 --> 34:14.572
Sure. Why don't you tell
me who your source was?

34:15.583 --> 34:16.618
That's it?

34:16.685 --> 34:18.712
You're not gonna try and find Mooney?

34:19.922 --> 34:21.589
Barnes is on it. I've had a long day.

34:21.657 --> 34:22.956
I'm gonna get a drink.

34:23.025 --> 34:25.025
Gordon...

34:28.429 --> 34:30.732
Nothing.

34:36.505 --> 34:39.139
- Come on.
- I said no.

34:39.208 --> 34:41.509
- Who are they?
- Just people.

34:41.577 --> 34:43.110
They need me to do things for them.

34:43.178 --> 34:44.379
Well, I can do stuff.

34:46.148 --> 34:47.882
These are scary people, okay?

34:47.949 --> 34:50.991
- It's for your own good.
- You just don't want to share.

34:51.120 --> 34:54.255
Just stay here, all right?

35:01.063 --> 35:02.664
Hello?

35:02.731 --> 35:04.599
What do you want?

35:04.667 --> 35:07.168
I want to talk to her.

35:07.236 --> 35:10.238
I was following her.

35:10.306 --> 35:11.934
She was kind to me.

35:13.742 --> 35:15.576
But then she met him. That boy.

35:15.644 --> 35:17.345
What happened to you?

35:18.511 --> 35:21.476
- You know me?
- Uh, yeah. I know Bruce Wayne.

35:21.514 --> 35:23.151
Who is he? Who is he?

35:23.218 --> 35:24.496
What's wrong with you? Let go of me!

35:24.520 --> 35:25.553
Bruce Wayne!

35:25.621 --> 35:27.488
Bruce Wayne.

35:27.556 --> 35:29.424
Who is he?

35:32.094 --> 35:33.995
Really do not have time for this!

35:34.063 --> 35:35.196
He started it.

35:35.264 --> 35:36.431
It's a lie!

35:36.498 --> 35:37.899
They cwub is in our territory

35:37.966 --> 35:39.867
"Cwub?" What's a "cwub?"

35:39.935 --> 35:41.602
Cwub.

35:41.670 --> 35:44.005
What's a "cwub?" I mean,
can anyone understand him?

35:44.073 --> 35:45.807
- Do you know what a "cwub" is?
- Cwub.

35:45.874 --> 35:47.742
Enough.

35:47.810 --> 35:49.577
We will work something out.

35:49.645 --> 35:52.246
Now, this is his territory.

35:52.314 --> 35:54.048
What are you willing to give him?

36:03.859 --> 36:05.226
Boop.

36:06.295 --> 36:07.829
That is not helpful.

36:07.896 --> 36:10.598
Are you telling me you don't
see what's going on here?

36:10.666 --> 36:13.183
He is behind this.

36:13.861 --> 36:14.941
What are you talking about?

36:15.003 --> 36:17.438
He sent this ding dong to squeeze us,

36:17.506 --> 36:18.850
hoping it would send us back to you,

36:18.874 --> 36:21.309
so that he could lord it over Tabby.

36:21.377 --> 36:22.543
Ain't that right?

36:22.611 --> 36:25.246
That's c... that's just... that's crazy.

36:25.314 --> 36:26.881
She's crazy.

36:26.949 --> 36:28.649
She was in Arkham. Hello?

36:28.717 --> 36:30.251
"Hello?" So was I.

36:31.320 --> 36:32.687
Is that true, Butch?

36:36.725 --> 36:37.992
Unbelievable.

36:47.803 --> 36:49.937
Fine. Run your club.

36:50.005 --> 36:52.006
Just so we're clear,

36:52.074 --> 36:54.008
the only reason you are alive

36:54.076 --> 36:55.476
is Butch.

36:55.544 --> 36:59.377
The moment he gives
the word, you're mine.

37:16.665 --> 37:18.433
Hello again.

37:18.500 --> 37:21.135
I know why you brought me here.

37:21.203 --> 37:22.737
Your body is beginning to reject

37:22.805 --> 37:25.473
the changes we made to your DNA.

37:25.541 --> 37:29.143
You feel it every time you use...

37:29.211 --> 37:30.411
your ability.

37:30.479 --> 37:32.914
How do I fix it?

37:32.981 --> 37:35.016
Stop using the power.

37:35.083 --> 37:36.951
Every time you use it,

37:37.019 --> 37:39.086
new cells are activated,
and your body rejects them.

37:39.154 --> 37:43.057
Stop, and you will recover.

37:43.125 --> 37:44.703
It's that simple.

37:45.252 --> 37:46.676
It's just...

37:46.957 --> 37:49.797
I like the new me.

37:49.865 --> 37:51.999
I can't fix you.

37:52.067 --> 37:53.968
I can't re-order your DNA...

37:57.263 --> 38:00.333
There's... always a way.

38:01.210 --> 38:03.611
Strange. He can.

38:04.913 --> 38:06.147
He's the only one.

38:10.089 --> 38:12.887
- Where is Strange?
- I don't know.

38:12.955 --> 38:15.323
They've hidden him somewhere secret.

38:15.390 --> 38:18.526
Him fixing me is just the beginning.

38:19.761 --> 38:21.162
I want an army.

38:22.446 --> 38:24.532
I want an army like me!

38:24.600 --> 38:27.034
And he is going to give it to me.

38:27.102 --> 38:30.549
- He can't.
- Oh, he will.

38:32.007 --> 38:33.774
Or he will die.

38:35.878 --> 38:37.778
You remember Marv.

38:37.846 --> 38:39.661
He's one of yours.

38:40.275 --> 38:42.984
Sort of a... fountain of youth

38:43.051 --> 38:44.952
in reverse.

38:51.326 --> 38:53.294
Good night, Ethel.

38:53.362 --> 38:55.396
No!

39:19.363 --> 39:20.909
We caught a spy.

39:21.379 --> 39:22.379
Ivy?

39:22.417 --> 39:24.585
Selina, tell this creep

39:24.652 --> 39:25.819
to let go of me.

39:25.887 --> 39:27.020
She's my friend.

39:27.956 --> 39:30.724
- I don't like spies.
- She's not a spy.

39:30.792 --> 39:33.193
Ivy, what are you doing here?

39:33.261 --> 39:35.272
I followed you the other day,
so I knew where you went.

39:35.296 --> 39:36.864
Bruce Wayne came looking for you,

39:36.931 --> 39:38.332
but he was acting all weird...

39:38.399 --> 39:40.634
Who else have you told about us?

39:40.702 --> 39:42.102
- No one.
- I asked her.

39:42.170 --> 39:43.904
- Selina...
- Ivy, shut up!

39:43.972 --> 39:45.783
They're those monsters everyone's
talking about, aren't they?

39:45.807 --> 39:47.374
You better tell your friend

39:47.442 --> 39:49.109
to be careful who she calls a monster.

39:49.177 --> 39:50.844
You better stay away from me.

39:50.912 --> 39:52.146
All of you! I'll tell!

39:56.885 --> 39:58.273
Marv?

40:00.822 --> 40:02.623
No!

40:02.690 --> 40:03.991
Leave her alone!

40:04.058 --> 40:05.993
Stay away from me!

40:09.664 --> 40:10.898
Ivy!

40:10.965 --> 40:12.299
Ivy!

40:17.172 --> 40:18.472
Ivy!

40:19.641 --> 40:21.108
Watch out!

40:22.844 --> 40:24.711
Help!

40:28.950 --> 40:29.983
Ivy?

41:31.946 --> 41:33.780
Right, once this alarm
is set, Master Bruce,

41:33.848 --> 41:36.550
no coming downstairs till
the morning, is that clear?

41:36.618 --> 41:38.585
Yes, but was a new alarm
system really necessary?

41:38.653 --> 41:40.130
I don't know. Was it really necessary

41:40.154 --> 41:43.323
offering a challenge to a shadowy cabal?

41:44.726 --> 41:47.961
Yes, it was necessary, Master Bruce.

42:58.132 --> 43:00.233
Alfred?

43:00.301 --> 43:02.169
Alf...

43:02.236 --> 43:03.236
Alfred!

43:06.341 --> 43:07.908
Alfred, wake up.

43:07.975 --> 43:09.643
Alfred!
