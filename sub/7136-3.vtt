01:46.033 --> 01:48.133
- The Bill of Rights,

01:48.200 --> 01:50.900
those first ten amendments
to the Constitution?

01:50.967 --> 01:53.433
We invented them, us,

01:53.500 --> 01:55.967
the U.S. of A.

01:56.033 --> 01:58.600
Before our Founding Fathers
dipped their quills

01:58.667 --> 02:01.333
into the inkwell
and wrote the Bill of Rights,

02:01.400 --> 02:03.133
no other country
had ever defined

02:03.200 --> 02:05.900
a government's responsibility
to its people.

02:05.967 --> 02:08.166
The prime
responsibility being

02:08.233 --> 02:11.567
to preserve liberty.

02:11.633 --> 02:14.400
Liberty!

02:14.467 --> 02:16.033
Of course,
there are those

02:16.100 --> 02:19.133
who take all kinds
of liberties with liberty.

02:19.200 --> 02:21.166
- Sometime yesterday
before 5:00,

02:21.233 --> 02:22.934
two inmates escaped
through a tunnel

02:23.000 --> 02:25.066
under the southeast wall
of the prison.

02:25.133 --> 02:27.700
Miguel Alvarez,
30s, Latino,

02:27.767 --> 02:30.533
and Agamemnon Busmalis,
50s, Caucasian,

02:30.600 --> 02:32.533
are not believed
to be armed.

02:32.600 --> 02:34.867
Alvarez is, however,
considered dangerous.

02:34.934 --> 02:36.467
- Alvarez!

02:36.533 --> 02:37.834
- I want to assure
the public

02:37.900 --> 02:39.567
that there is
a coordinated effort

02:39.633 --> 02:41.266
by Warden Glynn's staff,

02:41.333 --> 02:43.567
the local police department,
and state troopers

02:43.633 --> 02:45.567
to locate and apprehend
these criminals.

02:45.633 --> 02:47.133
- Warden Glynn!
- Warden Glynn.

02:47.200 --> 02:48.567
- Warden Glynn,
how long did it take

02:48.633 --> 02:49.834
for them to dig this tunnel?

02:49.900 --> 02:51.433
- I wouldn't know.

02:51.500 --> 02:53.066
- Can we assume the digging
took more than a day?

02:53.133 --> 02:55.400
- Yes.
- More than a week?

02:55.467 --> 02:57.166
- Yes.
- And how can your staff

02:57.233 --> 02:58.367
not have known
what was going on?

02:58.433 --> 03:00.667
- Busmalis
is a low-risk prisoner

03:00.734 --> 03:02.467
who demonstrates
no aggressive tendencies

03:02.533 --> 03:05.066
and so was given
slightly more freedom than,

03:05.133 --> 03:06.400
in retrospect,
he should have.

03:06.467 --> 03:08.467
- You say Alvarez
is dangerous?

03:08.533 --> 03:09.834
- He has a history
of violence,

03:09.900 --> 03:11.133
but he's been
under medication

03:11.200 --> 03:12.800
to control
that kind of behavior.

03:12.867 --> 03:14.367
- Hey, Hernandez,

03:14.433 --> 03:17.066
look like you missed your
chance to kill Alvarez, huh?

03:17.133 --> 03:19.834
- Adebisi, you'd better
shut the fuck up, man.

03:25.433 --> 03:26.934
- Those goddamn reporters.

03:27.000 --> 03:28.633
- You handled yourself
well, Leo,

03:28.700 --> 03:30.200
all things considered.

03:30.266 --> 03:32.300
- Well, I appreciate
your standing by me.

03:32.367 --> 03:34.100
- People love
a prison break.

03:34.166 --> 03:35.400
It's sexy, exciting.

03:35.467 --> 03:36.567
- But in the end,

03:36.633 --> 03:38.233
they want the escapees
captured.

03:38.300 --> 03:39.533
- We know where
their families are,

03:39.600 --> 03:40.667
who their friends are.

03:40.734 --> 03:42.000
We're watching
every plane, train,

03:42.066 --> 03:43.333
and highway in the state.

03:43.400 --> 03:44.333
We'll get them.

03:44.400 --> 03:45.734
- I hope so,

03:45.800 --> 03:47.200
because if we don't,

03:47.266 --> 03:52.200
your chances of becoming
lieutenant governor are zero.

03:53.900 --> 03:55.000
- You had no idea

03:55.066 --> 03:56.867
Busmalis was working
on a tunnel?

03:56.934 --> 03:58.600
- No.

03:58.667 --> 04:00.000
The truth is,
I'm a little hurt

04:00.066 --> 04:01.934
that he didn't ask me
to go with him.

04:02.000 --> 04:04.467
- Alvarez never talked
to you about escaping?

04:04.533 --> 04:05.767
- When?

04:05.834 --> 04:07.967
He's in Solitary.
Then he's in the hospital.

04:08.033 --> 04:09.367
- Come on, Hernandez,

04:09.433 --> 04:11.567
you hate Alvarez
as much as I do.

04:11.633 --> 04:13.300
Help me
bring him back.

04:13.367 --> 04:14.767
- I don't know dick.

04:16.467 --> 04:17.467
- Yo.

04:19.266 --> 04:21.400
- I want word out
on the street.

04:21.467 --> 04:22.800
When Alvarez
shows his face,

04:22.867 --> 04:24.367
I want his fucking
heart ripped out

04:24.433 --> 04:26.033
and shoved up
his fucking ass.

04:26.100 --> 04:27.433
- El Cid.

04:27.500 --> 04:28.500
- Go.

04:28.567 --> 04:30.000
- Alvarez...

04:30.066 --> 04:31.767
I kill you.

04:31.834 --> 04:34.200
I kill you, Alvarez.
- No, Papi!

04:34.266 --> 04:36.300
- I kill you! I kill you!
- No, Papi!

04:36.367 --> 04:39.166
- Yo, Adebisi,
feeling cocky today?

04:40.266 --> 04:41.900
Always.

04:41.967 --> 04:43.367
- Yeah, you won't be
feeling so fucking cocky

04:43.433 --> 04:45.200
after I talk
to the hacks.

04:45.266 --> 04:47.066
- About what?

04:47.133 --> 04:48.934
- About you giving
the French guy the gun.

04:50.333 --> 04:52.633
Warden wants to know
how Frenchy killed four guys.

04:54.967 --> 04:57.233
I tell him it was you
that was responsible,

04:57.300 --> 05:00.900
they're gonna ship your
kokolo ass to Death Row, bro.

05:01.000 --> 05:03.200
- Tell them it was me,

05:03.266 --> 05:04.633
I tell them
it was you, Papi.

05:04.700 --> 05:07.667
- Hey, that's fine.
We'll see who he believes.

05:07.734 --> 05:10.300
- So Adebisi gave the gun
to Tarrant?

05:10.367 --> 05:13.700
- Yeah, he wanted a white man
to shoot a black man.

05:13.767 --> 05:15.834
- Why?
- Why?

05:15.900 --> 05:17.533
Stir things up.

05:17.600 --> 05:19.133
- One last question.

05:19.200 --> 05:21.767
Who did Adebisi
get the gun from?

05:27.867 --> 05:29.166
Step out.

05:36.834 --> 05:38.033
Who?

05:43.433 --> 05:44.633
- Hughes.

05:44.700 --> 05:47.300
- Hughes?

05:47.367 --> 05:49.467
Clayton Hughes?

05:49.533 --> 05:51.867
- The day you fired him
as a CO.

05:51.934 --> 05:56.533
- Oh...fuck!

06:02.066 --> 06:03.900
- Leo, what's up?

06:03.967 --> 06:05.433
You called,
said come right over.

06:07.333 --> 06:10.300
Look at you.

06:10.367 --> 06:13.867
Like a Zulu.

06:13.934 --> 06:15.900
- What's this about?

06:15.967 --> 06:17.633
- Right there.

06:17.700 --> 06:20.433
Right fucking there.

06:20.500 --> 06:23.133
- Yeah, I know.
That's where my dad died.

06:24.567 --> 06:27.500
- Stabbed...by an inmate.

06:27.567 --> 06:29.834
- A white  inmate.

06:33.667 --> 06:36.033
- Clayton,

06:36.100 --> 06:38.000
I'm gonna ask you
something,

06:38.066 --> 06:40.100
and I want you
to tell me,

06:40.166 --> 06:43.233
on your father's soul,

06:43.300 --> 06:44.734
the absolute truth.

06:44.800 --> 06:47.333
- Yes, I gave
Adebisi the gun.

06:49.834 --> 06:50.934
Feel better?

06:51.000 --> 06:52.500
- No.

06:52.567 --> 06:54.000
- I knew the minute I heard
your voice on the phone

06:54.066 --> 06:55.600
that you knew
what I had done.

06:55.667 --> 06:57.734
Because of me, four people
are dead, four black  people.

06:57.800 --> 06:59.000
- Shut up.
- No, Leo--

06:59.066 --> 07:00.133
- Don't say any more!
- Listen to me.

07:00.200 --> 07:03.233
- Don't say another
goddamn word.

07:05.500 --> 07:07.266
Officer Mineo.

07:07.333 --> 07:09.700
Look, we're gonna
get you a lawyer,

07:09.767 --> 07:12.767
and until then, I don't want you
saying anything to anybody.

07:12.834 --> 07:14.633
You understand?
- I am guilty.

07:14.700 --> 07:18.467
- Clayton, I'm trying
to protect you.

07:18.533 --> 07:20.467
- Hey, Clayton,
how you doing?

07:20.533 --> 07:21.567
- Arrest him.

07:21.633 --> 07:22.700
- What?

07:22.767 --> 07:24.867
- I said
arrest him.

07:36.000 --> 07:39.533
- Yes, Hughes
gave me the gun.

07:39.600 --> 07:41.266
- And you gave it
to Tarrant?

07:41.333 --> 07:42.433
- No.

07:42.500 --> 07:44.166
Look, the cocksucker

07:44.233 --> 07:46.166
stole the weapon from my cell.

07:47.934 --> 07:49.700
- Take him to the Hole.

08:15.233 --> 08:16.233
- CabrÃ³n.

08:28.567 --> 08:31.066
- Prisoner number 00M871,

08:31.133 --> 08:32.800
Enrique Morales,

08:32.867 --> 08:35.533
convicted April 6, 2000,

08:35.600 --> 08:37.133
murder in the second degree.

08:37.200 --> 08:39.767
Sentence: 25 years!

08:39.834 --> 08:42.967
Up for parole in 15.

08:44.367 --> 08:45.967
- Hernandez,
Adebisi, and me

08:46.033 --> 08:47.633
have been partners
selling tits.

08:47.700 --> 08:49.033
- This, I know.

08:49.100 --> 08:50.533
- Hernandez is having
some kind of nervous breakdown.

08:50.600 --> 08:52.066
- This, I also know.

08:52.133 --> 08:55.900
- We don't want a partner
who's, uh, loco.

08:55.967 --> 08:58.133
You come with cred,

08:58.200 --> 09:00.333
so we're offering you
Hernandez's third.

09:00.400 --> 09:01.767
- If I waste him?

09:01.834 --> 09:05.600
- Yes.
Do it quietly.

09:05.667 --> 09:07.000
And soon.

09:26.667 --> 09:28.367
- May I come in?
- Well--

09:28.433 --> 09:30.800
- I won't hurt you, sir.
Sit.

09:36.333 --> 09:40.066
I'm not like
Hernandez or Guerra.

09:40.133 --> 09:42.900
They're spics,
old-school thugs.

09:42.967 --> 09:45.133
Me, I'm a businessman.

09:45.200 --> 09:48.233
I like Armani suits.
I surf the net.

09:48.300 --> 09:50.133
- Really?

09:50.200 --> 09:52.200
- I have a proposition
for you.

09:52.266 --> 09:53.467
- Really?

09:53.533 --> 09:56.066
- Raoul Hernandez
must be killed,

09:56.133 --> 09:58.467
but he's so paranoid,

09:58.533 --> 10:01.300
he won't let
anybody near him.

10:01.367 --> 10:04.767
I need the person
he would suspect the least

10:04.834 --> 10:06.867
to finish him off.

10:06.934 --> 10:09.166
And that, Mr. Rebadow,

10:09.233 --> 10:10.166
is you.

10:10.233 --> 10:12.333
- Me?
I can't kill anyone.

10:12.400 --> 10:14.767
- You did once before,
and that's why you're here.

10:14.834 --> 10:17.133
- No, I won't do it.

10:21.834 --> 10:23.033
- Well, you see, sir,

10:23.100 --> 10:25.834
this really isn't
a multiple choice.

10:25.900 --> 10:28.166
You kill him,
or I kill you.

10:28.233 --> 10:29.734
It's that simple.

10:29.800 --> 10:31.834
- I can go into
protective custody.

10:31.900 --> 10:33.333
- For the rest
of your life?

10:33.400 --> 10:36.000
It's pretty lonely
up there.

10:36.066 --> 10:38.300
I would hate to think of you
spending your twilight years

10:38.367 --> 10:39.734
mumbling to yourself.

10:39.800 --> 10:41.300
- But if I kill
Hernandez,

10:41.367 --> 10:43.567
I go to Solitary
or Death Row.

10:43.633 --> 10:44.800
- No, no, no, no.

10:44.867 --> 10:46.700
Here's the beauty part.

10:46.767 --> 10:50.033
We get you moved
into Hernandez's cell.

10:50.100 --> 10:52.567
I'll handle
the arrangements.

10:52.633 --> 10:54.734
And in the middle
of the night,

10:54.800 --> 10:56.700
you stick him
in the neck,

10:56.767 --> 11:00.934
just like you did
that guy 35 years ago.

11:01.000 --> 11:02.934
You yell for help

11:03.000 --> 11:05.500
and say that Hernandez
was attacking you.

11:05.567 --> 11:07.600
- That I killed him
in self-defense.

11:07.667 --> 11:10.033
- Exactly.

11:10.100 --> 11:12.200
Such a sweet old fella.

11:12.266 --> 11:14.367
Who's gonna doubt
your word?

11:14.433 --> 11:18.133
So do we have a deal?

11:18.200 --> 11:21.734
- What do I get
in return?

11:21.800 --> 11:23.633
- Anything you want.

11:23.700 --> 11:27.133
- Okay, I'll kill him.

11:28.734 --> 11:31.166
- I've known Raoul Hernandez
for many years,

11:31.233 --> 11:35.600
and he's changed--
not for the better.

11:38.333 --> 11:40.700
- Sure is quieter
lately.

11:40.767 --> 11:43.867
- He's edgy, dangerous.

11:44.834 --> 11:46.467
- And you suggest?

11:47.867 --> 11:51.166
- He needs
a calming influence.

11:51.233 --> 11:55.467
Someone like, say...

11:55.533 --> 11:57.233
Rebadow.

11:57.300 --> 12:00.000
- Hmm.

12:22.200 --> 12:25.533
- It's not my fault.
I didn't ask to move in here.

12:25.600 --> 12:27.367
- I know.

12:27.433 --> 12:30.333
We have no say.

12:30.400 --> 12:33.000
So how many years
you been here in Oz?

12:33.066 --> 12:35.734
- 35, give or take a day.

12:35.800 --> 12:39.734
- That's about as long
as I've been in prison.

12:39.800 --> 12:43.133
All my life,
in and out.

12:43.200 --> 12:46.667
35 years,
and what do we get?

12:46.734 --> 12:48.567
- Get?

12:48.633 --> 12:50.033
- Yeah, I mean, ain't we
supposed to get something

12:50.100 --> 12:52.367
out of being
locked up?

12:52.433 --> 12:54.300
- No, I don't
think so.

12:56.333 --> 12:59.934
- You know, I wanna
see Alvarez dead.

13:00.000 --> 13:02.200
I don't know why.

13:02.266 --> 13:04.000
You know, it's like, um,

13:04.066 --> 13:05.800
one of those
reflexes you get

13:05.867 --> 13:07.233
when they tap you
in the knee

13:07.300 --> 13:09.834
and your leg jumps up.

13:09.900 --> 13:11.667
What's your first name, viejo?

13:11.734 --> 13:13.033
Don?

13:13.100 --> 13:14.033
- Bob.

13:14.100 --> 13:16.500
- Oh, Bob.

13:18.166 --> 13:20.200
Go to sleep, Bob.

13:23.633 --> 13:25.200
Go to sleep, Bob.

13:38.033 --> 13:39.734
- Yeah?

13:41.500 --> 13:42.433
- We got him, Warden.

13:42.500 --> 13:43.934
- Bring the bastard in.

13:44.000 --> 13:45.066
- Yes, sir.

13:45.133 --> 13:46.100
Bring him in.

13:48.967 --> 13:50.900
- Ow.

13:50.967 --> 13:51.900
Hi, Warden.

13:51.967 --> 13:53.900
- Busmalis,
good to see you.

13:53.967 --> 13:55.166
- Likewise.

13:55.233 --> 13:56.834
These cuffs
are very tight.

13:56.900 --> 13:57.967
- Well, you're gonna have

13:58.033 --> 13:59.333
to endure the pain
a little longer.

13:59.400 --> 14:00.934
You and me
are going on TV.

14:01.000 --> 14:03.300
- Really?
How do I look?

14:03.367 --> 14:04.867
- Busmalis was found
stalking the home

14:04.934 --> 14:06.233
of Miss Whitney Allen,

14:06.300 --> 14:08.433
who plays Miss Sally on
the popular children's show

14:08.500 --> 14:09.834
"Miss Sally's Schoolyard."

14:09.900 --> 14:12.367
- Any sign of the other
escapee, Alvarez?

14:12.433 --> 14:14.867
- No, but we're
closing in on him.

15:54.567 --> 15:56.433
- "No person
shall be held to answer

15:56.500 --> 15:59.600
"for any capital
or otherwise infamous crime

15:59.667 --> 16:03.233
unless under presentment
or indictment of grand jury."

16:03.300 --> 16:07.033
Now, that's part of Article Five
of the Bill of Rights.

16:07.100 --> 16:09.066
The first two articles
get all the press.

16:09.133 --> 16:10.900
You know,
freedom of speech,

16:10.967 --> 16:13.500
freedom of religion,
the gun thing.

16:13.567 --> 16:15.667
But Article Five, baby,

16:15.734 --> 16:17.133
that's the one
you gotta cling to

16:17.200 --> 16:19.000
when they slap on
them cuffs.

16:19.066 --> 16:22.000
"No person shall be compelled
in any criminal case

16:22.066 --> 16:24.266
"to be witness
against himself

16:24.333 --> 16:27.133
"nor deprived
of life, liberty,

16:27.200 --> 16:30.867
or property
without due process of law."

16:30.934 --> 16:33.133
Deprived of life.

16:57.700 --> 16:59.567
- Out of the Hole
already?

16:59.633 --> 17:00.800
- Yeah.

17:00.867 --> 17:02.967
- You missed
all the fun.

17:03.033 --> 17:05.734
- You know, Hernandez's
murder only helps us.

17:05.800 --> 17:07.367
Now we can go to Glynn
and tell him

17:07.433 --> 17:09.266
that Murphy can't control
Emerald City

17:09.333 --> 17:11.133
any better than McManus

17:11.200 --> 17:14.000
and that Glynn has to hire
a black man for the job.

17:14.066 --> 17:16.000
- We tried that
and got nowhere.

17:16.066 --> 17:17.967
The more we push Glynn
in one direction,

17:18.033 --> 17:19.433
the more resistant
he gets.

17:19.500 --> 17:21.300
- Then we have to apply
pressure from the outside.

17:21.367 --> 17:23.200
We get community leaders
to pressure him.

17:23.266 --> 17:25.200
- We don't know
any community leaders.

17:25.266 --> 17:26.333
- Said does.

17:26.400 --> 17:30.066
- No, not Said.

17:30.133 --> 17:31.700
He won't get involved.

17:34.200 --> 17:36.433
- Have faith,
Muslim, eh?

17:36.500 --> 17:38.133
Have faith.

17:46.033 --> 17:48.033
You are looking good.

17:51.266 --> 17:53.133
I need your help.

17:55.734 --> 17:57.533
Jama'a.

18:00.166 --> 18:01.900
Let me ask you,

18:01.967 --> 18:03.700
do you agree that life
would be better

18:03.767 --> 18:05.800
if a black man
ran Emerald City?

18:05.867 --> 18:08.133
- That depends
upon the black man.

18:08.200 --> 18:10.333
- Let's say you
get to help pick.

18:10.400 --> 18:13.200
- Now, why would Glynn
let me do that?

18:13.266 --> 18:15.767
- Because you
have influence.

18:18.934 --> 18:21.200
- I know the man
that I would choose

18:21.266 --> 18:24.633
would not be
your choice.

18:24.700 --> 18:26.133
- Are you sure?

18:26.200 --> 18:30.700
- Yes, because you are looking
to manipulate someone.

18:30.767 --> 18:32.166
- And you are not?

18:32.233 --> 18:36.133
- Don't play me,
Adebisi.

18:36.200 --> 18:37.867
I know you're
up to something.

18:37.934 --> 18:39.800
- You and me,
we have different ways,

18:39.867 --> 18:43.333
different reasons
for what we do, okay.

18:43.400 --> 18:46.667
But our goal
is the same:

18:46.734 --> 18:49.000
the survival
of our people.

18:52.934 --> 18:54.200
- Jama'a.

18:57.800 --> 19:00.333
- We appreciate you taking
the time to see us, Warden.

19:00.400 --> 19:02.834
- I'm always open to input
from the community.

19:02.900 --> 19:04.233
- Actually,
we're concerned about

19:04.300 --> 19:06.166
the most recent incident
of racial tension

19:06.233 --> 19:07.500
that has culminated
in the deaths

19:07.567 --> 19:09.166
of several
African-Americans.

19:09.233 --> 19:10.667
- We believe
that your decision

19:10.734 --> 19:12.967
to fire Tim McManus as
unit director of Emerald City

19:13.033 --> 19:15.233
will only help ease
the situation.

19:15.300 --> 19:17.767
- This murder last night,
a white man killed a Latino?

19:17.834 --> 19:19.300
- That wasn't
racially motivated.

19:19.367 --> 19:21.133
- Even so, we believe
the man that you have

19:21.200 --> 19:22.633
running Emerald City
temporarily

19:22.700 --> 19:24.467
isn't any more qualified
than McManus.

19:24.533 --> 19:25.767
- What we're interested in
is this.

19:25.834 --> 19:27.667
Who do you plan
to replace McManus with

19:27.734 --> 19:29.100
on a permanent basis?

19:29.166 --> 19:31.400
- Well, I'm going over
a number of applicants.

19:31.467 --> 19:33.934
- Obviously, we know
you'll select the best man.

19:34.000 --> 19:35.734
We simply ask you that,
if possible,

19:35.800 --> 19:37.300
you choose
a person of color.

19:37.367 --> 19:38.700
- Ah.

19:38.767 --> 19:40.266
- We believe that many
mistakes were made

19:40.333 --> 19:41.834
because McManus didn't have
enough experience

19:41.900 --> 19:43.633
dealing with men
from the inner cities.

19:43.700 --> 19:45.066
- I see.

19:47.533 --> 19:48.767
- We hear that you
may be running

19:48.834 --> 19:50.967
as Devlin's
lieutenant governor.

19:51.033 --> 19:54.266
We would certainly consider
throwing our support behind you

19:54.333 --> 19:57.700
if we knew that you were
sympathetic to our concerns.

20:01.033 --> 20:03.500
- The truth is,
I am thinking about

20:03.567 --> 20:05.700
hiring a black man
for the job,

20:05.767 --> 20:08.100
maybe a black woman.

20:08.166 --> 20:10.133
- That's excellent news.

20:10.200 --> 20:12.367
- I'm not making
any promises.

20:12.433 --> 20:13.500
- Of course not.

20:13.567 --> 20:15.200
Whoever's most qualified.

20:15.266 --> 20:16.667
- Absolutely.

20:16.734 --> 20:18.600
Absolutely.

20:33.367 --> 20:35.900
- Mobay?

20:35.967 --> 20:38.000
Mobay!

20:38.066 --> 20:39.734
Yo, man.
- Yeah, man?

20:39.800 --> 20:41.200
- Yo, man,
you move my chair?

20:41.266 --> 20:42.533
How many times I gotta
fucking tell you

20:42.600 --> 20:43.867
don't move my chair?

20:43.934 --> 20:45.333
- I had to pee
last night.

20:45.400 --> 20:47.500
- I don't give a shit
about you peeing!

20:51.066 --> 20:53.000
Look, man, all day,
I got people fucking with me,

20:53.066 --> 20:55.166
all right, jumping on the back
of my chair and shit!

20:55.233 --> 20:56.767
I don't need you
fucking with me too!

20:56.834 --> 20:58.600
- Okay, okay.

21:04.633 --> 21:06.567
I'm sorry
I moved the chair.

21:06.633 --> 21:08.600
- It's all right.

21:33.967 --> 21:35.500
- I finished
typing your speech

21:35.567 --> 21:37.233
for the Downtown
Businessman's Association.

21:37.300 --> 21:38.400
- Oh, yeah?

21:38.467 --> 21:39.700
What'd you think?

21:39.767 --> 21:41.834
- Cut it by half.

21:41.900 --> 21:43.367
- Oh.

21:50.100 --> 21:51.834
- I've been summoned.

21:51.900 --> 21:53.633
- Summoned?

21:53.700 --> 21:58.133
- To meet with Adebisi,
Pancamo, and Morales.

21:58.200 --> 21:59.867
They'd asked for the name
of a Jamaican drug dealer

21:59.934 --> 22:01.433
they could check with
about me.

22:01.500 --> 22:02.834
I gave them
Nesta Parks.

22:02.900 --> 22:05.266
We busted Parks
four years ago.

22:05.333 --> 22:06.834
Now he's up for parole.

22:06.900 --> 22:08.066
Knows we'll lean
on the board

22:08.133 --> 22:09.500
if he says
the right things.

22:09.567 --> 22:12.000
- Well, I guess he did.

22:12.066 --> 22:16.266
- Yeah, well, I doubt
it's my last hurdle.

22:16.333 --> 22:18.333
Our merry little trio
will probably want

22:18.400 --> 22:19.767
to share some heroin
with me.

22:19.834 --> 22:21.400
- You know, as a law
enforcement officer,

22:21.467 --> 22:23.367
you're not allowed
to use drugs.

22:23.433 --> 22:25.800
- Don't worry.
We have ways of faking it.

22:25.867 --> 22:27.633
Usually the perps are
so fucked up themselves,

22:27.700 --> 22:29.367
they don't even notice.

22:29.433 --> 22:31.333
- Even so,
from here on,

22:31.400 --> 22:33.166
it's gonna get
a lot more dangerous.

22:33.233 --> 22:35.767
- You worried
about me, Warden?

22:35.834 --> 22:37.533
- No, I just don't
want to have

22:37.600 --> 22:40.967
to break in
another new assistant.

22:41.033 --> 22:42.233
By half, huh?

22:42.300 --> 22:43.700
- At least.

22:47.266 --> 22:48.767
- Where is he?

22:48.834 --> 22:50.700
- He's coming.

22:50.767 --> 22:53.367
- I don't like
Jamaicans.

22:53.433 --> 22:55.166
- You don't like
anybody.

23:01.600 --> 23:03.767
So far,
you check out.

23:03.834 --> 23:05.266
- There are
a few more steps

23:05.333 --> 23:08.100
you gotta take before
you can gain our friendship.

23:08.166 --> 23:10.100
- You could be
an undercover cocksucker,

23:10.166 --> 23:14.333
but undercover cocksuckers
aren't allowed to use drugs.

23:16.133 --> 23:19.667
Now, we know you've been
buying a lot of product,

23:19.734 --> 23:22.700
but no one's ever
seen you use the stuff.

23:28.867 --> 23:30.033
- Enjoy.

23:31.767 --> 23:33.967
- We wanna see it
go up your nose.

23:48.900 --> 23:51.033
- More.

23:57.266 --> 23:58.867
- More.

24:07.800 --> 24:09.533
- More.

24:31.200 --> 24:34.300
- Hey, man.
You okay?

24:34.367 --> 24:35.533
Mobay!

24:35.600 --> 24:37.800
Yo, Mobay, you--

24:37.867 --> 24:39.633
Mobay?

24:43.066 --> 24:45.500
Mobay, look--oh!

24:48.400 --> 24:50.867
Yo, you got
a serious problem, bro.

24:50.934 --> 24:52.433
Yo, man, look at me.

24:52.500 --> 24:53.800
Look, I know
where you at, right?

24:53.867 --> 24:55.633
I don't a whole share
of that shit.

24:55.700 --> 24:58.033
We gotta get you
some help, man, all right?

24:58.100 --> 25:01.333
- Shakedown, shakedown!

25:04.400 --> 25:05.567
- Stand up.

25:05.633 --> 25:07.567
- Everybody in front
of their cells!

25:21.900 --> 25:23.834
- You, out!

25:33.700 --> 25:36.333
- "The right of the people
to be secure in their person,

25:36.400 --> 25:38.900
"houses, papers,
and effects

25:38.967 --> 25:41.233
"against unreasonable
searches and seizures

25:41.300 --> 25:43.767
"shall not be violated.

25:43.834 --> 25:47.600
"And no warrants shall issue
but upon probable cause,

25:47.667 --> 25:50.266
"supported by oath

25:50.333 --> 25:52.900

25:57.767 --> 25:59.600

26:25.700 --> 26:27.700
- What's this, Hill?

26:27.767 --> 26:29.767
- I don't know.
Looks like drugs.

26:31.767 --> 26:33.133
- Those are mine.

26:33.200 --> 26:36.233
- No kidding.

26:36.300 --> 26:37.767
To the Hole.

26:41.734 --> 26:42.834
- Whoa!

27:02.467 --> 27:04.100
- Leave us.

27:09.066 --> 27:12.533
Hey, you okay?

27:12.600 --> 27:15.166
- Momentary setback.

27:15.233 --> 27:16.800
I'll be fine.

27:34.367 --> 27:35.433
- All right, Cramer.

27:35.500 --> 27:37.934
Meet me later
in the library.

27:42.133 --> 27:43.333
As-salaam alaikum.

27:43.400 --> 27:44.967
- Is the rumor true?

27:45.033 --> 27:48.000
You gonna defend
that...man?

27:49.800 --> 27:51.233
- Yes, I am.

27:51.300 --> 27:53.567
- I forbid it.

27:54.867 --> 27:56.000
- You forbid it?

27:56.066 --> 27:57.934
- You swore you wouldn't
challenge me.

27:58.000 --> 28:00.633
- Over leadership, Arif.

28:00.700 --> 28:02.700
I did not say that I would
subjugate my actions

28:02.767 --> 28:04.967
to your will.

28:11.066 --> 28:13.834
- Harley versus the State.

28:13.900 --> 28:17.266
A black man's life sentence
was overturned

28:17.333 --> 28:18.500
when it was discovered
that the judge

28:18.567 --> 28:19.967
presiding over the trial

28:20.033 --> 28:22.066
was an active member
of the Ku Klux Klan.

28:22.133 --> 28:23.533
- So you think
'cause a juror at my trial

28:23.600 --> 28:25.734
made antigay remarks,

28:25.800 --> 28:28.200
I might get set free?

28:28.266 --> 28:31.367
- Let's just say, at best,
you can hope for a new trial.

28:31.433 --> 28:32.767
- Excuse me, Said.

28:32.834 --> 28:35.000
I just heard the news
on the TV.

28:35.066 --> 28:36.433
Our lawsuit, we won.

28:36.500 --> 28:37.867
- What?

28:37.934 --> 28:40.066
- The jury decided
that the state was responsible

28:40.133 --> 28:42.433
for the deaths and injuries
caused after the riot.

28:42.500 --> 28:43.867
- They say how much money
we're gonna be getting?

28:43.934 --> 28:45.233
- The amount won't be
announced until next week,

28:45.300 --> 28:46.533
but the newscaster said

28:46.600 --> 28:48.700
it could be
the full $45 million.

28:48.767 --> 28:51.266
- Oh, fuck, yes! Nice!

28:51.333 --> 28:52.500
- Great news, huh?

28:52.567 --> 28:54.000
- That's very good.

28:54.066 --> 28:55.667
Now, if you'll
excuse me,

28:55.734 --> 28:57.367
Jason and I
are working.

28:58.533 --> 29:00.500
- Yeah, okay.

29:02.900 --> 29:04.567
- Now, where was I?

29:04.633 --> 29:09.934
Yes, Harley versus the State.

29:10.000 --> 29:11.667
- I thought you'd be happy.

29:11.734 --> 29:13.066
- I am happy.

29:13.133 --> 29:16.333
- Kareem, Arnie Zelman
says that we could get

29:16.400 --> 29:20.533
upwards of $250,000 each
from the settlement.

29:21.734 --> 29:23.033
- I've decided I'm gonna
take the money

29:23.100 --> 29:24.800
and start again.

29:24.867 --> 29:26.367
- Well, that's terrific.

29:26.433 --> 29:28.834
- I hate my job.

29:28.900 --> 29:30.467
I hate my apartment.

29:30.533 --> 29:33.100
I hate everything
about living in town.

29:33.166 --> 29:36.100
I'm moving to California.

29:36.166 --> 29:37.567
- California?

29:37.633 --> 29:42.133
- The only thing
I'll miss here is you.

29:42.200 --> 29:45.200
And even this,
my visits here,

29:45.266 --> 29:48.633
seem wrong.

29:48.700 --> 29:50.433
'Cause we can never
be intimate

29:50.500 --> 29:54.133
the way I know
in my heart we should.

29:54.200 --> 29:58.433
I love you, Kareem.

29:58.500 --> 30:02.834
And I know you love me.

30:02.900 --> 30:06.500
And I know why
you can't say it,

30:06.567 --> 30:09.000
but please,

30:09.066 --> 30:13.166
just this once,

30:13.233 --> 30:15.066
please say it.

30:15.133 --> 30:18.133
Tell me you love me.

30:18.200 --> 30:19.600
- No.

30:25.200 --> 30:28.033
This will make
your leaving

30:28.100 --> 30:30.967
easier...

30:31.033 --> 30:32.400
for both of us.

30:41.667 --> 30:45.266
- Hello, Minister.
- Mr. Fortunato.

30:45.333 --> 30:46.600
My client,
Jason Cramer.

30:46.667 --> 30:49.433
- Hey.
- Yeah, how ya doing?

30:49.500 --> 30:52.800
Congrats on winning that
lawsuit against the state.

30:52.867 --> 30:54.467
- Thank you.

30:54.533 --> 30:57.433
- All rise
for Judge Mason Koessler.

31:03.233 --> 31:04.934
Be seated.

31:05.000 --> 31:06.467
- All right, gentlemen,

31:06.533 --> 31:07.700
I have read the motion
by the plaintiff.

31:07.767 --> 31:09.266
I am ready
to hear arguments.

31:10.700 --> 31:12.467
- Your Honor,

31:12.533 --> 31:16.433
Jason Cramer is a homosexual.

31:16.500 --> 31:18.400
But he was not
on trial for that.

31:18.467 --> 31:20.934
He was on trial for
murder in the first degree,

31:21.000 --> 31:24.400
kidnapping, assault
with a dangerous instrument.

31:24.467 --> 31:27.333
Now, a juror,
a Mr. Christopher Jacobs,

31:27.400 --> 31:30.066
during the jury's
deliberations,

31:30.133 --> 31:32.633
made continuous defamatory
statements to the others

31:32.700 --> 31:35.967
regarding Mr. Cramer's
sexual orientation.

31:36.033 --> 31:37.867
- I did not go on
and on and on.

31:37.934 --> 31:39.900
I made a couple
of simple statements.

31:39.967 --> 31:42.233
Every one of those people
on the jury agreed with me.

31:42.300 --> 31:43.800
- And was one of those
simple statements,

31:43.867 --> 31:45.467
"This should not take long,"

31:45.533 --> 31:47.033
that "he was a fag,"

31:47.100 --> 31:49.166
that "all fags
should be dead"?

31:49.233 --> 31:51.200
- I don't know if I said
those words exactly.

31:51.266 --> 31:52.934
- Before you heard
any other evidence,

31:53.000 --> 31:54.200
any other witnesses,

31:54.266 --> 31:55.800
how were you gonna vote?

31:55.867 --> 31:57.100
- Guilty.

31:57.166 --> 31:58.567
- Mr. Cramer.

32:00.166 --> 32:01.333
- Yes, Your Honor?

32:01.400 --> 32:03.300
- Your lawyers
should never have allowed

32:03.367 --> 32:05.734
Christopher Jacobs
a seat in the jury box.

32:05.800 --> 32:07.467
That was their mistake.

32:07.533 --> 32:09.500
Normally, I would
chalk it up to bad luck

32:09.567 --> 32:11.033
on your part
and wish you well,

32:11.100 --> 32:13.934
but there was a judge
presiding at your trial,

32:14.000 --> 32:16.200
and he should never have
allowed Jacobs to serve.

32:16.266 --> 32:19.667
And for that reason,
and for that reason only,

32:19.734 --> 32:22.767
I am going to grant
your motion for a new trial.

32:22.834 --> 32:24.266
- Yeah!

32:24.333 --> 32:25.734
- Your Honor,
Your Honor--

32:25.800 --> 32:26.834
- You can whine to me,
Counselor,

32:26.900 --> 32:28.033
on the way back to town.

32:28.100 --> 32:29.967
- Thanks.

32:32.667 --> 32:35.133
- "In all
criminal prosecutions,

32:35.200 --> 32:36.900
"the accused
shall enjoy the right

32:36.967 --> 32:39.867
"to a speedy
and public trial

32:39.934 --> 32:42.867
"by an impartial jury,

32:42.934 --> 32:48.667
"to be confronted with
the witnesses against him,

32:48.734 --> 32:52.834
and to have the assistance
of counsel for his defense."

33:13.100 --> 33:15.266
- I suffocated
Antonio Nappa.

33:15.333 --> 33:17.233
- The mob boss?
- One and the same.

33:17.300 --> 33:20.033
- That took balls.
- Not really.

33:20.100 --> 33:22.133
I killed him at the behest
of Mr. Chucky Pancamo.

33:22.200 --> 33:24.000
- Pancamo wanted
to take over?

33:24.066 --> 33:25.600
- I don't know
the politics, honey.

33:25.667 --> 33:27.533
I just got
the job done.

33:30.967 --> 33:32.033
- Lights out.

34:01.567 --> 34:03.834
- Hi.
- Hi.

34:03.900 --> 34:06.300
- Let's get rid of this.

34:27.233 --> 34:28.767
- Zeke Bellinger,
the ex-husband

34:28.834 --> 34:30.900
of condemned prisoner
Shirley Bellinger,

34:30.967 --> 34:33.166
has requested
that after the execution,

34:33.233 --> 34:35.200
the state hand her body
over to him

34:35.266 --> 34:37.533
for burial beside
their slain daughter.

34:37.600 --> 34:39.667
- Hey, rumor has it
that Shirley Bellinger

34:39.734 --> 34:42.266
wanted to be buried
in an unmarked grave.

34:42.333 --> 34:43.734
- So why's he going
against her wishes?

34:43.800 --> 34:46.800
- I hear hubby went born again
after the drowning.

34:58.166 --> 34:59.667
- Hello, Shirley.

34:59.734 --> 35:03.567
- Zeke, you're
looking very thin.

35:03.633 --> 35:05.567
That new wife
not feeding you?

35:05.633 --> 35:08.300
- Patsy's a singer.
She don't have time to cook.

35:08.367 --> 35:09.934
- Singer, huh?

35:10.000 --> 35:11.667
- A chanteuse.

35:11.734 --> 35:15.133
- My, my, lucky you.

35:15.200 --> 35:17.300
She pregnant?

35:17.367 --> 35:19.734
- We decided
not to have kids.

35:19.800 --> 35:21.700
- She afraid what it
might do to her figure?

35:21.767 --> 35:24.266
Might ruin that
chanteusing career?

35:24.333 --> 35:26.066
- No, I just wouldn't
be able to survive

35:26.133 --> 35:29.400
losing another child.

35:29.467 --> 35:32.000
- I want to be buried
in an unmarked grave.

35:32.066 --> 35:33.433
- No, it's wrong.

35:33.500 --> 35:34.533
- All the years
we were married,

35:34.600 --> 35:36.233
you never did
one thing I asked.

35:36.300 --> 35:38.066
Do this.
- No.

35:38.133 --> 35:39.567
- I wanna be
lost in oblivion.

35:39.633 --> 35:42.000
- It's too late for that,
Shirley. You're infamous.

35:42.066 --> 35:43.467
- I don't understand.

35:43.533 --> 35:46.400
I'd think you wouldn't want me
buried anywhere near Katie.

35:46.467 --> 35:49.600
- Well, you see,
you're wrong,

35:49.667 --> 35:52.500
'cause I forgive you.

35:52.567 --> 35:54.100
- You forgive me?

35:54.166 --> 35:56.867
- Took me all this time
to get my heart in place,

35:56.934 --> 35:59.367
but Reverend Kney,
he's been very helpful to me,

35:59.433 --> 36:01.100
praying with me,
praise the Lord!

36:01.166 --> 36:02.867
- You forgive me?

36:02.934 --> 36:04.033
- Yes.

36:04.100 --> 36:05.300
- What makes you think

36:05.367 --> 36:06.834
I want your fucking
forgiveness?

36:06.900 --> 36:08.066
- Now, Shirley,
don't cuss.

36:08.133 --> 36:09.767
- You come in here
all high and mighty

36:09.834 --> 36:12.000
deciding to free me
of my guilt?

36:12.066 --> 36:14.567
Well, Zeke,
I don't feel guilty.

36:14.633 --> 36:17.233
I did what I had to do,
and unlike you,

36:17.300 --> 36:19.400
at least my balls
were big enough.

36:20.667 --> 36:22.767
You came to console me?

36:22.834 --> 36:24.567
Well, I got a little
consolation prize

36:24.633 --> 36:25.734
for you, darling.

36:25.800 --> 36:27.367
You and the chanteuse
ought to go ahead

36:27.433 --> 36:28.967
and have yourselves
another child,

36:29.033 --> 36:32.200
because when Katie died,

36:32.266 --> 36:34.000
you didn't lose a child.

36:34.066 --> 36:35.867
She wasn't yours.

36:35.934 --> 36:37.066
- What?

36:37.133 --> 36:39.066
- Your father raped me.

36:39.133 --> 36:42.367
That child was his seed.

36:42.433 --> 36:44.233
- Goddamn you!

36:53.100 --> 36:55.000
- I'm gonna put this
under my pillow tonight,

36:55.066 --> 36:56.767
wait for the tooth fairy
to come.

37:01.734 --> 37:03.066
- Yeah, I need that
by Friday.

37:03.133 --> 37:05.433
I'm dead serious.
All right, thanks.

37:08.900 --> 37:10.633
- And the money.

37:15.333 --> 37:17.500
- You know, Nikolai,

37:17.567 --> 37:19.400
I figure since
we made our peace pact

37:19.467 --> 37:21.500
and now that
we're comrades and all

37:21.567 --> 37:23.867
that you wouldn't be charging me
to use the cell phone.

37:23.934 --> 37:25.567
- Just because we're not
trying to kill each other

37:25.633 --> 37:27.133
doesn't mean
you get a free ride.

37:27.200 --> 37:28.500
- You know, Nikolai,

37:28.567 --> 37:30.500
you and I are the only two
who know about this phone.

37:30.567 --> 37:34.266
I could tell a few people,
and they could take it away.

37:34.333 --> 37:37.133
- If the hacks
confiscate my phone,

37:37.200 --> 37:39.000
you won't be able
to use it.

37:39.066 --> 37:41.467
- Who said I was
gonna tell the hacks?

37:42.800 --> 37:44.233
- I'm real busy here,
O'Reily,

37:44.300 --> 37:46.266
so whatever you want,
make it fast and make it good.

37:46.333 --> 37:47.967
- Ralph Gulino.
- What about him?

37:48.033 --> 37:50.300
- I don't know, don't it
strike you odd that he's dead?

37:50.367 --> 37:52.300
- Odd?
Why odd?

37:52.367 --> 37:54.033
- Well, 'cause on the outside,
he had no history of using.

37:54.100 --> 37:55.600
- Well, a lot of guys
who were clean outside

37:55.667 --> 37:56.867
get hooked in Oz.

37:56.934 --> 37:57.900
- Yeah, but not Gulino.

37:57.967 --> 37:59.166
I mean, he and I
became friendly.

37:59.233 --> 38:00.500
He was here, like,
what, a week

38:00.567 --> 38:02.533
and he goes
from zero tolerance to OD?

38:02.600 --> 38:04.467
- O'Reily, I'm not big
on Morse code.

38:04.533 --> 38:06.266
Just tell me
what you wanna tell me.

38:06.333 --> 38:08.066
- I got nothing to tell.

38:08.133 --> 38:10.166
I don't know why anybody
would wanna grease Gulino,

38:10.233 --> 38:12.834
but I do know he was having
some run-ins with Stanislofsky.

38:12.900 --> 38:14.233
- Run-ins about what?

38:14.300 --> 38:15.834
- You'd have to ask
Stanislofsky.

38:15.900 --> 38:19.166
Get the fuck out of my office.

38:19.233 --> 38:21.166
Come on.

38:21.233 --> 38:23.900
- You're here because you're
concerned about Ryan O'Reily.

38:23.967 --> 38:27.633
- Well, the other day,
I saw him unwrap his bandage

38:27.700 --> 38:30.367
and hit his hand
repeatedly against the sink,

38:30.433 --> 38:31.934
deliberately
causing it to bleed.

38:32.000 --> 38:32.934
- Really?

38:33.000 --> 38:34.300
- I'm worried about him.

38:34.367 --> 38:37.066
He's self-destructive,
perhaps even suicidal.

38:37.133 --> 38:38.500
You should examine him,

38:38.567 --> 38:41.200
put him in isolation,
by himself.

38:41.266 --> 38:42.633
- Mm.

38:42.700 --> 38:44.033
I have to tell you,
Nikolai,

38:44.100 --> 38:46.066
I'm a tad suspicious
of your motives.

38:46.133 --> 38:48.333
In my experience,
every time a prisoner

38:48.400 --> 38:50.233
shows genuine concern
for another prisoner,

38:50.300 --> 38:51.767
he usually
has an agenda.

39:01.233 --> 39:02.667
- You wanna run that
past me again?

39:04.200 --> 39:06.433
- That Stanislofsky guy's
been talking shit about you.

39:06.500 --> 39:07.533
- Stan who?

39:07.600 --> 39:08.533
- The Russian guy.

39:08.600 --> 39:09.667
- What do I care about him?

39:09.734 --> 39:11.066
He's just
a nothing nobody.

39:11.133 --> 39:12.433
- Uh-uh.

39:12.500 --> 39:14.133
Those Russian mobsters,
they're crafty, Adebisi.

39:14.200 --> 39:16.266
They're crafty
and they're cold-blooded.

39:16.333 --> 39:17.900
He came to me asking
if I'd help him

39:17.967 --> 39:19.200
make a move
against you.

39:19.266 --> 39:21.367
- Yeah?
Let him try.

39:21.433 --> 39:23.000
- Oh, I'm just warning you,
that's all.

39:23.066 --> 39:25.333
- Go away, O'Reily.

39:26.467 --> 39:28.200
- No problem.

39:36.800 --> 39:38.200
- I love it
when he talks like that.

39:38.266 --> 39:39.367
What's shaking, man?

39:39.433 --> 39:40.633
- Ryan O'Reily.

39:40.700 --> 39:41.867
He knows we killed Gulino.

39:41.934 --> 39:43.200
He swears
to get revenge.

39:43.266 --> 39:45.567
- O'Reily and Gulino,
that don't add up.

39:45.633 --> 39:46.934
They weren't
in business together.

39:47.000 --> 39:48.200
They weren't
fucking each other.

39:48.266 --> 39:49.433
So why the fuck

39:49.500 --> 39:51.066
would O'Reily give a shit
about Gulino?

39:51.133 --> 39:52.834
- I'm telling you
what I heard.

39:52.900 --> 39:54.100
We should take care
of O'Reily

39:54.166 --> 39:55.567
before he comes at us.

39:55.633 --> 39:56.934
- If we whack
O'Reily now,

39:57.000 --> 39:58.767
the whole joint
goes back on lockdown.

39:58.834 --> 40:00.367
No way. We wait.

40:00.433 --> 40:02.066
- Hoyt, listen to me.

40:02.133 --> 40:03.367
- What, all of a sudden,
you don't understand English?

40:03.433 --> 40:04.834
We wait.

40:04.900 --> 40:06.266
- Yeah, yeah, yeah,
no, tomorrow's great.

40:06.333 --> 40:08.333
Okay, thanks, bye.

40:12.333 --> 40:14.300
Here you go, pal.

40:14.367 --> 40:15.934
- Anytime, my friend.

40:16.000 --> 40:17.300
- Yeah.

40:24.367 --> 40:25.900
Cyril, stop
playing around.

40:25.967 --> 40:27.500
- I'm not
playing around.

40:27.567 --> 40:29.266
- Well, then wash
behind your ears.

40:29.333 --> 40:31.967
- Nobody can see
behind my ears.

40:33.033 --> 40:34.433
- Listen, Cyril,

40:34.500 --> 40:36.233
today's the day that we're
meeting with Dr. Nathan

40:36.300 --> 40:38.333
and her husband's
parents, okay?

40:38.400 --> 40:39.834
- I know that.

40:39.900 --> 40:41.667
- Come on, you gotta take
this stuff seriously, man.

40:41.734 --> 40:43.000
- I am.

40:43.066 --> 40:45.767
- Well, then wash behind
your ears, all right?

40:45.834 --> 40:48.734
- Okay.
- Right there.

40:59.333 --> 41:01.734
- Gloria,
you seem anxious.

41:01.800 --> 41:04.834
- No, I'm fine.

41:04.900 --> 41:07.200
- Well, I'm anxious.

41:07.266 --> 41:10.400
I know, we've been
preparing for weeks,

41:10.467 --> 41:14.367
and Sister Peter Marie
feels we're all ready, but...

41:14.433 --> 41:16.834
I'm not sure what
my first reaction will be.

41:16.900 --> 41:19.600
I'm afraid I might
just want to clobber them.

41:19.667 --> 41:22.767
- Lars, they're
half your age.

41:22.834 --> 41:24.567
They'll clobber you.

41:24.633 --> 41:26.400
- Oh, well, even so.

41:26.467 --> 41:28.500
- We can still cancel,
you know?

41:28.567 --> 41:29.900
- No, we've
come this far.

41:29.967 --> 41:33.333
Let's see
the saga through.

41:33.400 --> 41:34.734
- I still
can't understand

41:34.800 --> 41:36.767
how you can keep
working here.

41:39.867 --> 41:40.800
- How's your hand?

41:40.867 --> 41:42.033
- Oh, it's fine.

41:42.100 --> 41:43.533
- Didn't you have
to go to the hospital?

41:43.600 --> 41:44.900
- No, it was nothing, you know,
a little bleeding.

41:44.967 --> 41:45.967
The wound reopened.

41:46.033 --> 41:48.433
- Mm-hmm.
I heard you reopened it.

41:48.500 --> 41:51.200
- Really?
Where'd you hear that?

41:51.266 --> 41:52.600
- Some people
are self-destructive,

41:52.667 --> 41:54.066
but not you.

41:54.133 --> 41:55.867
I can guess why
you did what you did.

41:55.934 --> 41:57.133
I can even
maybe guess why

41:57.200 --> 41:58.367
you're going
into this interaction

41:58.433 --> 41:59.667
with the Nathans now.

41:59.734 --> 42:01.533
- Well, I'm here to cure
Cyril of his nightmares,

42:01.600 --> 42:02.734
that's all.

42:02.800 --> 42:04.900
- Listen, Ryan,
I've told you this before.

42:04.967 --> 42:07.033
I am not going
to take you in there

42:07.100 --> 42:10.734
if you intend to cause Gloria
and Preston's parents more pain,

42:10.800 --> 42:12.834
because by professing
your love for Gloria,

42:12.900 --> 42:14.233
you will cause more pain.

42:14.300 --> 42:16.600
- I know, but I promised you,
didn't I?

42:16.667 --> 42:18.467
- Okay.

42:25.200 --> 42:27.600
Lars and Patricia Nathan,

42:27.667 --> 42:29.834
Ryan and Cyril O'Reily.

42:32.567 --> 42:33.967
- I'm sorry.

42:34.033 --> 42:36.066
- No, no, no,
I'm sorry.

42:36.133 --> 42:37.500
I'm sorry.

42:37.567 --> 42:40.767
- A child dies
of a disease,

42:40.834 --> 42:43.200
in war,

42:43.266 --> 42:46.867
hell, gets hit
by a crosstown bus,

42:46.934 --> 42:48.734
somehow you can
convince yourself

42:48.800 --> 42:52.166
his death makes sense.

42:52.233 --> 42:54.100
But this...

42:56.433 --> 42:58.467
It was so premeditated,

42:58.533 --> 43:00.633
so cold-blooded.

43:06.867 --> 43:11.100
- I was behind him,

43:11.166 --> 43:14.700
so I couldn't
see his eyes.

43:20.300 --> 43:23.033
If I had seen
his eyes...

43:26.533 --> 43:29.800
I don't know if
I could have kept going.

43:31.333 --> 43:35.133
- I keep thinking
about the future.

43:37.166 --> 43:39.867
Gloria and Preston
were almost ready

43:39.934 --> 43:41.567
to have children.

43:43.533 --> 43:45.467
My grandchildren.

43:48.567 --> 43:52.533
I hate you for taking them
away from me!

43:55.834 --> 43:57.967
- You can blame me
and Cyril all you want

43:58.033 --> 43:59.567
for not having
grandchildren,

43:59.633 --> 44:01.600
but the truth is,

44:01.667 --> 44:03.000
you're just
fooling yourselves.

44:03.066 --> 44:04.300
- Shut up.

44:04.367 --> 44:06.867
- No, let him finish.

44:06.934 --> 44:11.900
- The marriage between
Gloria and your son,

44:11.967 --> 44:13.166
it was over.

44:13.233 --> 44:14.834
- Is this true?
- No.

44:14.900 --> 44:16.266
- Liar.
- Ryan.

44:16.333 --> 44:18.033
- We were having
some problems.

44:18.100 --> 44:19.500
- She had an affair
with Tim McManus.

44:19.567 --> 44:20.900
- All right,
that's enough!

44:20.967 --> 44:22.400
You speak one more time
without my asking you,

44:22.467 --> 44:24.500
I'm shutting down
the session.

44:24.567 --> 44:25.667
- You had an affair?

44:25.734 --> 44:27.600
- Preston and I
were separated briefly.

44:27.667 --> 44:28.867
- Well,
he never told us.

44:28.934 --> 44:30.533
- We wanted to work it
out ourselves

44:30.600 --> 44:31.767
without any
interference.

44:31.834 --> 44:34.767
- Interference?
He was our son!

44:34.834 --> 44:36.867
And because of you,
he's lying in the ground!

44:36.934 --> 44:38.033
- Patricia.

44:38.100 --> 44:39.333
- Well, but it's true,
isn't it?

44:39.400 --> 44:42.467
Because of what went on
between her and him,

44:42.533 --> 44:43.900
Preston's dead!

44:43.967 --> 44:47.400
- This is what
you wanted, isn't it?

44:47.467 --> 44:49.333
To get us fighting
with each other.

44:49.400 --> 44:51.100
- No.
- Yes.

44:51.166 --> 44:53.000
You always have
some plan, O'Reily,

44:53.066 --> 44:54.433
some secret agenda.

44:54.500 --> 44:56.133
- Not this time!

44:56.200 --> 44:58.266
Unlike you,
I never made it a secret!

44:58.333 --> 45:00.633
I love you!
- Stop it!

45:00.700 --> 45:02.900
- I always will,
and that will never change!

45:03.000 --> 45:04.767
- Officers!
- No, let him say it!

45:04.834 --> 45:06.700
Let him try
and convince himself.

45:06.767 --> 45:09.567
Everything
you have ever done

45:09.633 --> 45:12.033
for your entire life,
O'Reily,

45:12.100 --> 45:15.500
you've only done
for yourself.

45:15.567 --> 45:18.734
You don't know
how to love.

45:18.800 --> 45:20.700
I'm leaving.

45:26.734 --> 45:28.533
I'll call you later.

45:45.633 --> 45:49.800
- Once something's bad,
it can never get good.

45:53.667 --> 45:56.133
- Yeah, yeah.

45:56.200 --> 45:58.700
I need it done
by tonight.

45:58.767 --> 46:00.834
Yeah, I'm serious.

46:00.900 --> 46:03.667
Okay, all right.

46:11.066 --> 46:12.500
- Who were you talking to?
- Nobody.

46:12.567 --> 46:14.600
Let's go watch
"Miss Sally."

46:41.767 --> 46:43.066
- You're shittin' me.

46:43.133 --> 46:45.367
- No, I heard it from
Timmy Kirk this morning.

46:45.433 --> 46:47.967
- Hey, who's
this spic Morales?

46:48.033 --> 46:49.233
- Yo, O'Reily,
you hear the news?

46:49.300 --> 46:50.400
- About what?

46:50.467 --> 46:51.934
- Dr. Nathan.

46:52.000 --> 46:53.500
Last night on her
way home from work,

46:53.567 --> 46:54.500
she got raped.

46:54.567 --> 46:57.266
- Raped?
- Yeah.

46:57.333 --> 46:58.700
- Huh.

47:01.600 --> 47:02.867
- Article Eight:

47:02.934 --> 47:05.533
"Excessive bail
shall not be required

47:05.600 --> 47:07.834
"nor excessive fines imposed

47:07.900 --> 47:10.467
"nor cruel and unusual
punishment.

47:10.533 --> 47:14.033
Cruel and unusual.

47:14.100 --> 47:17.066
In Oz, cruel is
the usual punishment.

47:17.133 --> 47:21.300
- Sister, what happened
to Gloria fucking sucks.

47:21.367 --> 47:22.800
- Yeah, it's terrible.

47:22.867 --> 47:24.400
- Before we begin,

47:24.467 --> 47:26.800
have you heard any more
about how Chris is doing?

47:26.867 --> 47:28.200
- No.

47:28.266 --> 47:31.533
- Rumor has it
he'll be back in Oz today,

47:31.600 --> 47:32.934
though he'll be
spending some time

47:33.000 --> 47:34.934
in the hospital ward.

47:35.000 --> 47:36.200
- Where'd you hear that?

47:36.266 --> 47:38.100
- My sister.

47:38.166 --> 47:40.834
She's a doctor
over at Benchley Memorial.

47:40.900 --> 47:43.700
- Your sister's
a doctor?

47:43.767 --> 47:45.667
- Yeah.

47:45.734 --> 47:48.033
- What's she practice,
voodoo?

47:48.100 --> 47:50.700
- Hey, can we get
started, please?

47:50.767 --> 47:52.467
Poet, since you're
in such a talkative mood,

47:52.533 --> 47:54.100
why don't you do
the kickoff?

47:54.166 --> 47:56.934
- Okay, I wrote a poem.

47:57.000 --> 47:59.533
Fear not love
loosen its hooks

47:59.600 --> 48:01.533
from its sheath
and capture you

48:01.600 --> 48:04.266
in its painfully
seductive grasp.

48:04.333 --> 48:07.400
Fear not the blood
that oozes from your wounds

48:07.467 --> 48:10.567
and holds your patience
to task.

48:10.633 --> 48:13.700
Fear not the tearing
sounds of passion

48:13.767 --> 48:17.233
as they rip apart
the feelings at the start.

48:17.300 --> 48:20.233
Fear not the fainting
pulse of heartbeat,

48:20.300 --> 48:24.633
for that, that is
the very best part.

48:24.700 --> 48:26.066
- Hi, Padre.

48:26.133 --> 48:27.433
- You asked to see me?

48:27.500 --> 48:29.633
- You know I got shot.

48:29.700 --> 48:33.100
You know I died?

48:33.166 --> 48:34.533
During surgery.

48:34.600 --> 48:37.367
They brought me back
from the dead twice.

48:37.433 --> 48:40.900
Now, you come nose-to-nose
with death like that,

48:40.967 --> 48:43.533
you begin to see things
different.

48:43.600 --> 48:46.467
- Are you telling me
that you've changed?

48:46.533 --> 48:50.200
- Sister Peter Marie okay?

48:51.600 --> 48:52.900
- Yes.

48:52.967 --> 48:54.900
- I don't mean physically.
I mean here.

48:59.367 --> 49:01.467
You know I fucked
with that woman.

49:01.533 --> 49:04.200
I enjoy sex.
Don't you?

49:04.266 --> 49:06.300
I bet you were wild.

49:06.367 --> 49:09.600
I wanted her
to help me with Beecher.

49:09.667 --> 49:12.367
Now I hear she's thinking
of quitting the convent,

49:12.433 --> 49:15.967
and, well, I wanna do something
to make it up to her.

49:16.033 --> 49:17.567
- Well, Chris,
even you would admit

49:17.633 --> 49:20.000
that your credibility's
pretty low.

49:20.066 --> 49:23.800
- Look,

49:23.867 --> 49:28.166
there's no--there's no reason
for you or her to believe me,

49:28.233 --> 49:31.066
but I gotta try.

49:31.133 --> 49:33.200
I gotta try
to make her see

49:33.266 --> 49:37.433
that I know that
what I did was wrong.

49:37.500 --> 49:40.400
I don't wanna burn in hell.

49:40.467 --> 49:43.333
- What do you
want me to do?

49:43.400 --> 49:46.166
- Have Sister Pete
come visit me.

49:48.600 --> 49:50.266
- Pete?

49:50.333 --> 49:51.767
- Hi.

49:51.834 --> 49:54.633
- I just came from visiting
Chris Keller.

49:54.700 --> 49:56.066
- How is he?

49:56.133 --> 49:58.300
- He's back
in full force.

49:58.367 --> 50:00.400
He says that he wants
to talk to you.

50:00.467 --> 50:02.600
- Well, I don't
wanna talk to him.

50:07.600 --> 50:09.066
- Tobias,
maybe you should go.

50:09.133 --> 50:10.600
- No, we have
work to do.

50:10.667 --> 50:11.767
Stay where you are, Tobias.

50:11.834 --> 50:13.233
- Pete, he seems
full of remorse.

50:13.300 --> 50:15.066
How genuine that is
is tough to gauge,

50:15.133 --> 50:16.200
but if it's true--

50:16.266 --> 50:17.767
- It's not true.

50:17.834 --> 50:19.600
Chris Keller
is a manipulative,

50:19.667 --> 50:22.467
sociopathic liar.

50:22.533 --> 50:23.700
I won't go see him.

50:23.767 --> 50:25.100
- Well, what if he
really needs you,

50:25.166 --> 50:28.567
psychologically,
spiritually?

50:28.633 --> 50:29.800
- That's too bad.

50:29.867 --> 50:31.166
- Let me go.

50:31.233 --> 50:33.266
- Tobias, no.

50:33.333 --> 50:36.300
- Look, I know
better than you

50:36.367 --> 50:39.467
the hurt he can cause,

50:39.533 --> 50:42.200
but still,
I love him.

50:47.934 --> 50:50.900
- Take this
to Dr. Prestopnik.

50:53.667 --> 50:55.300
Don't.

51:14.867 --> 51:15.900
Hey.

51:17.533 --> 51:18.767
- Hey.

51:18.834 --> 51:21.066
- Beecher, what are you
doing in here?

51:21.133 --> 51:23.133
- I came to drop off a file
to Dr. Prestopnik.

51:23.200 --> 51:24.467
- Where's the file?

51:24.533 --> 51:25.867
- It's on his desk.

51:25.934 --> 51:28.767
- Well, if you delivered it,
take a walk.

51:28.834 --> 51:29.967
- Yeah, I just...

51:30.033 --> 51:31.934
- I don't give a shit.

51:32.000 --> 51:34.133
Take a walk.

51:36.934 --> 51:38.100
- I'll see you later.

51:45.567 --> 51:48.800
- Now, that was such
a touching moment.

51:48.867 --> 51:51.734
I'm gonna write
about it in my diary.

51:57.500 --> 51:58.934
- Where do you think
you're going?

51:59.000 --> 52:00.800
- I have information.
- Mm.

52:00.867 --> 52:02.266
- Mr. Schillinger,

52:02.333 --> 52:04.700
I'm the altar boy
for Father Mukada at Mass.

52:04.767 --> 52:07.500
When I'm in the office
changing out of vestments,

52:07.567 --> 52:09.200
sometimes I overhear things.

52:09.266 --> 52:10.667
This is primo stuff.

52:10.734 --> 52:11.967
- About what?

52:12.033 --> 52:13.233
- About you.

52:20.033 --> 52:22.233
- What do you want
in return?

52:22.300 --> 52:24.567
- This guy in my unit,
Stan Butwin,

52:24.633 --> 52:25.834
stole my watch.

52:25.900 --> 52:27.667
- Done.

52:27.734 --> 52:28.700
What do you got?

52:28.767 --> 52:30.734
- Your son Hank,

52:30.800 --> 52:32.700
I know who paid
to have him found

52:32.767 --> 52:34.467
and arranged
to have him see you.

52:34.533 --> 52:35.900
- Who?

52:38.266 --> 52:40.867
Beecher?

52:46.400 --> 52:48.233
- Hey, don't forget
my watch, will you?

52:50.700 --> 52:52.533
- Doesn't make any sense.

52:52.600 --> 52:55.633
Why would Beecher pay
to find your son?

52:55.700 --> 52:58.000
- This is some
plan of his,

52:58.066 --> 53:01.066
some double-dealing plan
to fuck with me.

53:01.133 --> 53:02.400
He's gonna use Hank
against me,

53:02.467 --> 53:06.100
the same way he did
with Andrew.

53:06.166 --> 53:08.533
- What are you
gonna do?

53:08.600 --> 53:10.300
- Take the offensive.

53:14.633 --> 53:16.767
Look, I know I was tough
on you and your brother

53:16.834 --> 53:21.233
growing up,
but you gotta understand,

53:21.300 --> 53:23.200
when your mom died,

53:23.266 --> 53:26.400
I had to raise you
all by myself.

53:26.467 --> 53:28.467
I'd drop you off
at school,

53:28.533 --> 53:30.166
same one
I went to,

53:30.233 --> 53:32.133
only it turned
into a shithole.

53:32.200 --> 53:37.300
Niggers and gangs, drugs.

53:37.367 --> 53:41.567
If I was hard,
it was only to protect you.

53:41.633 --> 53:44.867
- Yeah, I know that, Dad.

53:44.934 --> 53:49.066
- Do you?
- Yeah.

53:49.133 --> 53:51.867
I'm not like Andrew,

53:51.934 --> 53:55.300
blaming you for all
the fucked-up shit in his life.

53:55.367 --> 53:59.000
I know you did
the best you could.

53:59.066 --> 54:01.200
- Thank you, son.

54:01.266 --> 54:03.867
- You've gotten so huggy, man.

54:06.734 --> 54:08.967
- Listen, I want you
to do something for me.

54:09.033 --> 54:10.533
- Do something?

54:10.600 --> 54:12.600
- Yeah, a mission.

54:12.667 --> 54:15.367
- A crime.

54:15.433 --> 54:18.100
- Yes.

54:18.166 --> 54:19.166
- How much?

54:19.233 --> 54:20.500
- How much what?

54:20.567 --> 54:23.033
- How much cash?
- Cash?

54:23.100 --> 54:25.500
- You want the crime,
you gotta pay the dime.

54:28.166 --> 54:30.400
- $1,000.

54:30.467 --> 54:32.734
- I'm all yours, Daddy.

54:34.734 --> 54:38.166
- Here's what
I need you to do.

54:41.200 --> 54:42.567
- Beecher?
- Yeah?

54:42.633 --> 54:44.567
- Come with me.
- Where?

54:44.633 --> 54:46.900
- Warden Glynn's office.

54:46.967 --> 54:48.166
- What's the warden want
to see me for?

54:48.233 --> 54:49.934
- All he said was for me
to get you, so, uh,

54:50.000 --> 54:52.066
move your ass.

54:53.433 --> 54:55.700
Oh, fuck.

55:07.433 --> 55:09.633
Holy shit,
what's wrong?

55:09.700 --> 55:11.200
- Sit down.

55:15.300 --> 55:19.300
- Tobias, there's no
easy way to say this.

55:19.367 --> 55:21.200
- Well,
then just say it.

55:23.533 --> 55:25.967
- Your son and daughter
have been kidnapped.

55:31.200 --> 55:36.166
- No. No. No.

55:36.233 --> 55:38.166
No.

55:40.367 --> 55:42.266
- The Declaration
of Independence says

55:42.333 --> 55:44.633
that we are, all of us,
due certain rights,

55:44.700 --> 55:47.633
the most important
being life, liberty,

55:47.700 --> 55:50.467
and the pursuit
of happiness.

55:50.533 --> 55:52.867
I mean, and isn't that
what it's all about?

55:52.934 --> 55:56.700
Life, liberty...

56:01.700 --> 56:03.367
- Happiness.
