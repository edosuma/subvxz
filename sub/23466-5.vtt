00:12.167 --> 00:14.467
[female reporter]
Do you know the mood
within the compound?

00:14.767 --> 00:16.433
Well, our intel is saying

00:16.567 --> 00:19.733
that people
are starting to question
their loyalty to Koresh.

00:19.867 --> 00:21.033
[voices overlapping]

00:21.167 --> 00:22.400
How many people
are still inside?

00:22.533 --> 00:24.633
-[camera shutter clicks]
-We estimate 130.

00:24.767 --> 00:27.500
Is there any concern
for the possibility
of a mass suicide?

00:28.900 --> 00:31.000
All possibilities are a concern.

00:31.133 --> 00:35.033
Have you been talking
to the White House about
what's going on?

00:35.167 --> 00:38.000
Yes. They are apprised
of the situation.

00:38.133 --> 00:40.600
Sir, what do think it will take
for them to come out?

00:41.367 --> 00:45.067
[scoffs]
Apparently, a sign from God.

00:45.200 --> 00:46.333
[reporters clamoring]

00:48.167 --> 00:50.200
[theme music playing]

01:22.733 --> 01:24.600
[Steve]
I don't understand, Gary.

01:24.733 --> 01:27.533
-Why did you shut our power off?
-Look, you gotta understand.

01:27.667 --> 01:30.867
The negotiators do not get
100% of the input, okay?

01:31.067 --> 01:33.300
The tactical side,
they have a say in it, as well.

01:34.100 --> 01:35.800
Our position is moving forward.

01:36.567 --> 01:38.767
I thought we made
a lot of progress yesterday

01:38.900 --> 01:40.567
delivering you that milk
with Sheriff Harwell.

01:40.700 --> 01:42.867
[Steve] Me, too.
Which is why I'm confused.

01:43.067 --> 01:45.567
I mean, you send in
milk for the kids, then
turn off the power

01:45.700 --> 01:48.700
so it goes bad. I mean,
where's the sense in that?

01:53.100 --> 01:55.767
My bosses have it in their minds

01:55.900 --> 01:58.333
that this might become
another Jonestown.

01:58.467 --> 02:01.667
Another Jonestown?
Wait a second.

02:01.800 --> 02:04.667
Do you think that we are going
to kill ourselves?

02:04.800 --> 02:07.133
Well, frankly,
Steve, I don't know
what you're thinking.

02:07.267 --> 02:10.633
Gary, do you honestly believe
that I would spend

02:10.767 --> 02:13.367
this much time on the phone
with you if that was our plan?

02:13.500 --> 02:15.367
We're trying to find a solution.

02:15.500 --> 02:17.833
A solution that will take us
back to the life we had

02:17.967 --> 02:19.700
before you came in here
and ruined it.

02:19.833 --> 02:21.067
I am, too.

02:21.133 --> 02:22.533
Now, what I'd really
like to do

02:22.667 --> 02:24.733
is take advantage
of the good stuff

02:24.867 --> 02:27.067
that happened yesterday
and keep moving forward.

02:27.133 --> 02:30.067
-Do you think we can do that?
-Look. What I want you to do

02:30.167 --> 02:32.567
is tell our bosses we are not
going to kill ourselves.

02:32.700 --> 02:34.500
That is not what we're about.

02:34.633 --> 02:36.133
I will.

02:36.900 --> 02:38.600
Is David there?
I'd like to talk to him.

02:38.733 --> 02:40.167
David's not gonna
talk to you again

02:40.300 --> 02:42.867
until you turn
our electricity back on.

02:45.667 --> 02:48.333
[Prince] Lack of electricity
makes them less comfortable

02:48.467 --> 02:50.167
and more willing to compromise.

02:50.300 --> 02:52.100
Under normal circumstances, yes.

02:52.233 --> 02:53.133
But these people,
they already know

02:53.267 --> 02:54.667
how to live with nothing.

02:55.600 --> 02:57.700
All you're doing
is pissing 'em off.

02:59.633 --> 03:01.267
-Mitch feels differently.
-You know, sir,

03:01.400 --> 03:03.700
with you talking
to Mitch and I separately,

03:03.833 --> 03:06.433
it feels like we're operating
at cross purposes here.

03:06.567 --> 03:08.733
It's been nine days.

03:08.867 --> 03:11.367
How much longer
do I let this go on?

03:12.233 --> 03:13.533
As long as it takes.

03:13.667 --> 03:15.433
Do you know
what this is costing taxpayers?

03:15.567 --> 03:17.667
God damn it, I'm not worried
about taxpayers right now.

03:18.433 --> 03:21.200
Gary, we need to bring this
to a resolution.

03:21.333 --> 03:23.433
Look...

03:24.700 --> 03:27.867
Koresh has been bullied
his entire life.

03:28.067 --> 03:29.433
Here we go.

03:29.567 --> 03:31.567
The more you let HRT do
what they did last night,

03:31.700 --> 03:33.333
the more he's gonna dig in.

03:33.467 --> 03:34.733
He's let people out.

03:34.867 --> 03:36.567
That shows he's willing to work
with us.

03:36.700 --> 03:38.833
But we've gotta meet that
with positive reinforcement,

03:38.967 --> 03:40.333
not punishment.

03:40.467 --> 03:42.433
You wanna train a dog
to fetch your newspaper?

03:42.567 --> 03:43.833
Do you kick him in the balls

03:43.967 --> 03:45.967
every time he brings it
back to ya?

03:46.100 --> 03:46.900
No.

03:47.067 --> 03:48.933
I'm sorry, Tony.

03:49.800 --> 03:53.500
We both want the same thing.
You know that, right?

03:53.633 --> 03:56.867
But in order to get it,
we gotta turn the power back on!

03:58.967 --> 04:00.800
Whew.

04:03.067 --> 04:04.433
[splashing]

04:06.267 --> 04:07.633
[sniffles]

04:10.733 --> 04:12.333
-[Brad] Morning.
-Morning.

04:33.333 --> 04:36.633
Your mom...
it's sweet what she did.

04:36.767 --> 04:38.867
Yeah, it was kind of
embarrassing.

04:40.400 --> 04:42.433
I wish my mom
did something like that.

04:45.667 --> 04:48.233
-Yeah, what happened to her?
-She left.

04:49.067 --> 04:51.900
Right after I joined
the House of David.

04:52.700 --> 04:54.800
She didn't like
how that happened.

04:56.667 --> 04:58.367
What-- what's that like?

05:01.533 --> 05:03.433
Being married to David?

05:07.200 --> 05:08.567
[chuckles]

05:12.467 --> 05:13.600
It's...

05:14.367 --> 05:16.067
it's like...

05:16.200 --> 05:19.800
being married
to the most special person
in the world.

05:22.267 --> 05:24.367
But not being special yourself.

05:30.067 --> 05:31.833
You're special to me.

05:35.200 --> 05:37.067
You're special to me, too.

05:42.400 --> 05:44.967
[Steve] David wants you to try
and get that generator working.

05:45.767 --> 05:47.067
That thing hasn't worked
forever.

05:47.167 --> 05:49.733
I know, but you know,
do what you...

05:52.467 --> 05:54.500
[happy murmuring]

05:56.333 --> 05:58.533
[Steve] Hey! I take that back.

05:58.667 --> 06:02.233
[claps] Hey, Thibs,
will you turn that up for me?

06:02.367 --> 06:04.767
[TV news anchor]  Still no sign
of surrender. Robert...

06:04.900 --> 06:06.733
See what they're saying
about us now.

06:06.867 --> 06:09.700
...joins us now
live with the latest. Robert?

06:09.833 --> 06:12.467
We've just learned
that the Branch Davidians
who left Mt. Carmel

06:12.600 --> 06:14.200
have been arrested.

06:14.333 --> 06:17.067
Also, a judge has declared
those remaining inside

06:17.200 --> 06:18.567
to be unfit parents.

06:18.700 --> 06:20.067
Child Services
has been brought in

06:20.200 --> 06:22.767
to handle the situation
as it unfolds.

06:22.900 --> 06:25.567
[David] How dare you call us
"unfit parents"?

06:25.700 --> 06:28.433
When was the last time
you saw your kids, Gary?

06:28.567 --> 06:30.167
I see mine every day.

06:31.300 --> 06:34.100
The judge doesn't know you
or your people, David.

06:35.067 --> 06:37.700
Which is why
you need to come out
and tell your side of things.

06:37.833 --> 06:39.833
Oh, I'd love to tell
my side of things, Gary,

06:39.967 --> 06:41.833
but you won't let us speak
to the press.

06:41.967 --> 06:44.067
Every time I turn that TV on,

06:44.167 --> 06:47.233
all I see is "David Koresh,
the fanatic.

06:47.367 --> 06:48.700
David Koresh, the antagonist."

06:48.833 --> 06:50.167
Well, from what I can see,

06:50.300 --> 06:51.733
there's an awful lot
of sympathy for you

06:51.867 --> 06:53.200
and a lot of anger
towards the ATF

06:53.333 --> 06:54.500
in all parts
of the country.

06:55.367 --> 07:00.067
It's in your interest
to come out now, and not
have that sentiment turn.

07:00.167 --> 07:03.200
You know, you sure like
putting all the pressure
on us to come out,

07:03.333 --> 07:06.200
when what you should be doing
is just back off.

07:06.333 --> 07:07.567
Let time take its toll.

07:07.700 --> 07:09.200
Do you understand?

07:09.333 --> 07:10.900
It's not our desire
to die in here, Gary.

07:11.067 --> 07:12.367
I understand,

07:12.500 --> 07:14.133
and I've been trying
to buy time with my bosses,

07:14.267 --> 07:15.867
-but it's very difficult--
-Buy time for what?

07:16.067 --> 07:17.800
Before you come in here
full force?

07:17.933 --> 07:21.067
[Gary] No. Buy the time...

07:21.133 --> 07:22.467
you need, you know,

07:22.600 --> 07:25.100
to pray and talk to your God.

07:29.067 --> 07:30.233
Tell me, Gary...

07:31.233 --> 07:32.767
who's your God?

07:33.567 --> 07:35.800
You do believe in God, don't ya?

07:38.567 --> 07:40.200
I don't know what I believe.

07:40.333 --> 07:42.833
[David] Well, how do you think
all this started, Gary?

07:42.967 --> 07:45.400
Do you think i-it's all
just random?

07:45.533 --> 07:47.467
It's all one big coincidence?

07:47.600 --> 07:52.067
That a proton collided
with a neutron and that's
how it all got started?

07:52.133 --> 07:56.400
Well, who created
that proton, Gary?
Who created that neutron?

07:57.433 --> 08:00.867
How did the universe
get this possibility?

08:04.200 --> 08:07.400
The kids, David-- let's talk
about sending more of 'em out.

08:07.533 --> 08:09.700
[David] Gary, I know.

08:09.833 --> 08:12.467
I know you don't like talking
about religion.

08:12.600 --> 08:14.900
But religion is all I am.

08:15.067 --> 08:18.133
-Right, but the kids are what--
-Listen to me!

08:18.267 --> 08:22.467
Listen. Listen carefully.
These kids in here
are my children,

08:22.600 --> 08:24.833
and they ain't coming out!

08:24.967 --> 08:28.233
Especially to someone
who doesn't even believe in God.

08:28.367 --> 08:29.300
[handset slams]

08:33.567 --> 08:35.267
[tapping in rhythm]

08:37.367 --> 08:38.867
[drumming]

08:39.800 --> 08:41.400
That's hard.

08:41.533 --> 08:44.267
Well, everything's hard
until you practice it, right?

08:44.400 --> 08:46.100
-[faint whirring]
-Trust me.

08:46.233 --> 08:48.433
By your birthday,
I'm gonna have you playing
like John Bonham.

08:48.567 --> 08:50.933
[whirring]

08:51.933 --> 08:54.200
[aircraft engine buzzing, fades]

08:56.733 --> 08:59.667
Are you gonna leave us,
Thibodeau?

09:03.433 --> 09:04.433
Let's try again.

09:04.567 --> 09:06.633
[kids laughing and talking]

09:08.233 --> 09:10.900
Do these kids seem abused
to you?

09:11.067 --> 09:13.200
-No, they sure don't.
-Yeah.

09:13.333 --> 09:15.900
I've seen abused kids.
They don't act like this.

09:17.533 --> 09:19.433
[Gary] These children are loved.

09:19.567 --> 09:22.167
Their parents must be
suffering to be without 'em.

09:22.933 --> 09:24.633
But Koresh won't send out
any more kids.

09:24.767 --> 09:27.233
We need to start
working on the parents.

09:27.367 --> 09:29.100
Okay. How do we do that?

09:31.267 --> 09:32.967
Go get the camera.

09:33.100 --> 09:35.200
[kids chatting and laughing]

09:48.400 --> 09:50.100
What?

09:52.767 --> 09:54.867
[phone rings]

09:57.400 --> 09:59.200
[monitor beeps]

09:59.333 --> 10:01.967
-Hello.
-[Kathy] You lied to me.

10:02.800 --> 10:05.033
-Who's this?
-Kathy Schroeder.

10:05.167 --> 10:07.000
I saw that tape you sent.

10:07.133 --> 10:09.567
I gave my children over to you
and you lied to me!

10:09.700 --> 10:11.733
-[clicks]
-Get Gary!

10:13.200 --> 10:16.633
Uh, I'm sorry, Kathy.
You have me at a bit
of a disadvantage.

10:16.767 --> 10:18.233
I'm not sure
what we're talking about here.

10:18.367 --> 10:20.900
Danny!
I mean, where are his brothers?

10:21.033 --> 10:25.367
They're supposed to be together!
Danny is only three
and he's all alone!

10:25.500 --> 10:27.600
I don't know why your sons
would be separated.

10:27.733 --> 10:29.300
Wait.

10:31.367 --> 10:33.800
The father took them.
Now, why didn't he take Danny?

10:33.933 --> 10:36.000
Well, Danny's not his.

10:36.133 --> 10:39.167
He belongs to Mike.
You know, my second husband...

10:39.300 --> 10:42.100
who you killed?

10:42.233 --> 10:43.433
[Walter] Oh.

10:43.567 --> 10:45.900
I need you to get Danny
to his brothers.

10:46.033 --> 10:49.800
Okay? They'll look after him.
I need you to make Dale
understand.

10:49.933 --> 10:53.667
Kathy, your first husband
has no legal right to Danny.

10:53.800 --> 10:56.200
Well, nobody told me that! You--

10:56.967 --> 11:00.400
God, you guys are like--!
I mean, first you killed Mike,

11:00.533 --> 11:02.400
and now Danny's just all alone!

11:02.533 --> 11:04.100
[sobs] This is not right.

11:04.233 --> 11:07.167
-[sobbing] This is not right.
-Kathy...

11:07.300 --> 11:11.067
I'm so sorry. I can only imagine
what you're going through.

11:12.133 --> 11:13.933
But sometimes when it comes
to children,

11:14.067 --> 11:16.667
it's necessary to set aside
what we need

11:16.800 --> 11:18.400
for their needs.

11:19.367 --> 11:21.400
And right now...

11:21.533 --> 11:23.067
you know
what Danny needs most...

11:24.633 --> 11:26.133
is a hug from his mommy.

11:32.933 --> 11:34.700
[Kathy sobbing]

11:37.733 --> 11:40.233
-Shh...
-[Kathy gasps, sniffles]

11:40.367 --> 11:42.400
[whimpers] God...!

11:47.433 --> 11:48.800
Okay.

11:51.433 --> 11:54.600
[Kathy sighs] Okay.

11:54.733 --> 11:56.433
I'm coming out.

11:59.267 --> 12:00.500
[handset clicks]

12:02.333 --> 12:03.900
Whew. [sniffles]

12:11.800 --> 12:14.067
[sobs] I'm sorry.

12:23.900 --> 12:25.667
[Ron Engelman]
The ATF believe these guys

12:25.800 --> 12:29.800
were converting
semiautomatic weapons
into automatics.

12:29.933 --> 12:32.967
Now, in Texas, that's illegal.
Unless...

12:33.100 --> 12:37.600
you purchase a $25 permit,
in which case, it's fine.

12:37.733 --> 12:40.433
This is Ron Engelman,
reminding you to pay your
parking tickets,

12:40.567 --> 12:44.800
because the ATF is in town
and they're hunting Americans.

12:49.433 --> 12:52.233
I noticed you've been
sleeping in your car
the last few nights.

12:53.300 --> 12:55.067
Yeah, well,
there's a lot of press in town.

12:55.200 --> 12:57.133
I can't get a room
at a decent rate.

12:57.267 --> 12:58.500
I got a room.

12:58.633 --> 13:00.267
With two beds in it,
if you like.

13:01.067 --> 13:03.700
Thank you,
but I... got myself a pillow

13:03.833 --> 13:05.067
and my seat folds
all the way back.

13:05.133 --> 13:07.533
-So, I'm good.
-Okay. Look.

13:07.667 --> 13:10.633
I know you blame me
for everything that's happened.

13:10.767 --> 13:13.800
And I'll be the first to admit
I was not the best mother.

13:15.200 --> 13:16.900
I had David when I was 14.

13:17.800 --> 13:22.100
It's no excuse,
but what 14-year-old
knows how to raise a child?

13:22.867 --> 13:26.100
We don't have the luxury
to not like one another.

13:26.233 --> 13:30.967
We both want the same thing.
We both want our boys
to come out of there.

13:36.333 --> 13:38.900
Okay. Okay.

13:39.700 --> 13:42.067
I had my son when I was 16.

13:46.067 --> 13:48.167
I didn't have it
figured out either.

13:50.333 --> 13:53.967
My offer stands
if you change your mind.

13:54.900 --> 13:58.200
It's room 47. Okay?

14:01.533 --> 14:03.433
[sighs]

14:03.567 --> 14:04.900
[Thibodeau]
Serenity mentioned
it's her birthday next week.

14:05.067 --> 14:06.667
You planning anything?

14:06.800 --> 14:08.767
It's not really
an appropriate time
to celebrate.

14:09.700 --> 14:13.533
That's not how it works.
Can't not have a party
on your birthday.

14:16.667 --> 14:18.467
Everyone's spirit's down.

14:19.267 --> 14:20.867
All the more reason
to lift it up.

14:21.067 --> 14:22.267
I can help you plan
something--

14:22.400 --> 14:24.533
Thanks, Thibs,
but not now, okay?

14:26.067 --> 14:28.433
I'm sorry. Just not now.

14:30.533 --> 14:32.433
Uh...

14:36.067 --> 14:39.267
[David]  Kathy,
put your heart to wisdom.

14:40.167 --> 14:42.167
Think this through.

14:44.100 --> 14:46.233
These are the people
that murdered your husband.

14:47.633 --> 14:49.067
I know.

14:49.200 --> 14:52.300
[Kathy sighs] It...
it's not an easy decision,

14:52.433 --> 14:54.767
but Danny needs me.

14:55.533 --> 14:58.133
Well, if your desire
is stronger than your
loyalty to God,

14:58.267 --> 14:59.400
then we have our answer,
don't we?

14:59.533 --> 15:00.600
David...

15:00.733 --> 15:02.833
I know God is here. I know that.

15:03.733 --> 15:06.667
-It's-- it's all coming true--
-If you're gonna go, go.

15:07.433 --> 15:11.233
If you're looking
for my blessing, you ain't
getting it.

15:14.467 --> 15:16.067
Go.

15:17.733 --> 15:19.067
-Go on.
-[sighs]

15:29.467 --> 15:31.300
-Take Brad with you.
-Me?

15:34.067 --> 15:37.333
I heard you were drinking.
Is that the truth?

15:38.833 --> 15:40.567
[David]
We are all one body here.

15:40.700 --> 15:44.167
And for that body
to work properly, we all
need to be in harmony.

15:44.300 --> 15:46.600
If one finger isn't working,

15:46.733 --> 15:48.667
or if someone decides
to go out on their own--

15:48.800 --> 15:51.600
-David--
-then we're all out of harmony.

15:51.733 --> 15:54.967
This is God's test,
and you failed miserably.

15:55.100 --> 15:56.733
-[Rachel] Calm down.
-Don't tell me to calm down.

15:56.867 --> 15:58.900
I'm protecting us.

16:03.467 --> 16:05.233
You're done here.

16:06.233 --> 16:08.433
Steve, let 'em out.

16:10.067 --> 16:11.900
[whispers] Kathy...

16:27.100 --> 16:28.967
Sir, do you copy?

16:29.100 --> 16:31.900
[sniper over radio]
I have two targets in my view.
Over.

16:32.067 --> 16:33.600
[radio transmission]

16:58.067 --> 17:01.933
[David's voice]
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Everyone! Just calm down!

17:02.067 --> 17:05.133
[agent's voice]
Keep your hands in the air
and get on the ground, now!

17:05.267 --> 17:08.167
[footsteps approaching]

17:11.333 --> 17:13.500
I was right there.

17:16.733 --> 17:20.167
-I tried to stop it.
-[Judy] I know you did.

17:26.833 --> 17:28.233
[soft chuckle]

17:32.100 --> 17:34.367
God's not speaking to me
anymore.

17:37.067 --> 17:39.200
I have no idea
what I'm gonna do.

17:44.067 --> 17:46.067
You know, you always say

17:47.367 --> 17:49.467
"To trust God
in the light's easy, but...

17:49.600 --> 17:52.233
to trust Him
in the dark, that's faith."

17:55.633 --> 17:57.067
[David sighs]

18:04.100 --> 18:06.500
[wind whistling]

18:09.233 --> 18:11.467
[rumbling]

18:12.667 --> 18:14.300
[crashes]

18:21.600 --> 18:24.100
-What's happening?
-I don't know?

18:46.067 --> 18:48.400
[David] Everything you tell me
is a lie, Gary.

18:48.533 --> 18:50.933
No, Everything I tell you
is not a lie.

18:51.067 --> 18:53.867
I'm not the one
who drove that vehicle
onto your property, David.

18:54.067 --> 18:56.733
[David] I don't wanna hear it.
We aren't afraid of
the government.

18:56.867 --> 18:58.767
Big Brother wants to
come in here and fight,

18:58.900 --> 19:00.567
we will fight back.

19:00.700 --> 19:02.900
I think
we've proven that before.

19:03.067 --> 19:05.300
And as long
as our flag is still flying,
I'm gonna defend it.

19:05.433 --> 19:07.333
As an American citizen,

19:07.467 --> 19:09.633
anyone that steps
on my property,

19:09.767 --> 19:12.200
anyone that destroys
my property, is gonna get
their ass whupped.

19:12.333 --> 19:15.533
Look, I would feel
exactly the same way
if I was in your position.

19:15.667 --> 19:19.067
But, the thing is, these guys
are frustrated, too.

19:19.933 --> 19:22.867
And they don't wanna be here
any more than you
want them here.

19:23.067 --> 19:26.133
But try as I might,
I cannot get them to understand

19:26.267 --> 19:28.467
somebody waiting
for a sign from God.

19:28.600 --> 19:31.867
It's just not part
of their worldview.

19:36.067 --> 19:37.633
I get that, Gary.

19:37.767 --> 19:39.867
But we can get through this
if we work together, okay?

19:40.067 --> 19:44.200
Now I want you to sit tight.
I'm gonna go talk to my bosses

19:44.333 --> 19:46.067
and try and get those tanks
off your property.

19:46.200 --> 19:47.567
[Gary] Okay?

19:50.067 --> 19:52.767
Okay. All right.

19:53.733 --> 19:55.433
-[handset clicks]
-[sighs]

19:55.567 --> 19:57.267
[Gary] Do you realize
I'm getting all my information

19:57.400 --> 19:59.833
about what we're doing
from the Branch Davidians?

20:01.667 --> 20:02.900
Maybe you should move in
with them.

20:03.033 --> 20:04.400
God damn it!

20:06.233 --> 20:08.367
Why did you send
that damn tank in there?

20:10.033 --> 20:12.267
Because when I went to pick up
those people,

20:12.400 --> 20:17.400
I noticed several vantage
points where they could hide
and fire on our agents.

20:17.533 --> 20:19.767
I had to mitigate
their strategic advantage.

20:19.900 --> 20:21.767
You didn't try to "mitigate
their strategic advantage."

20:21.900 --> 20:25.433
You're trying to irritate them
into coming out!

20:25.567 --> 20:27.600
It's not a winning strategy!

20:27.733 --> 20:30.867
What's not a winning strategy
is "waiting for a sign
from God."

20:32.100 --> 20:33.967
-Sir, I--
-[Prince] No.

20:34.100 --> 20:38.033
I'm tired of buying you time.
You need to tell them
to come out.

20:38.167 --> 20:40.467
[Prince]
It's been 17 days, Gary.

20:40.600 --> 20:42.633
-I've been pushing 'em.
-Not hard enough.

20:42.767 --> 20:45.867
I'm under
an awful lot of pressure
to get them out.

20:46.000 --> 20:49.467
I have the attorney general
and every politician
in Washington

20:49.600 --> 20:52.267
breathing down my neck!

20:52.400 --> 20:55.467
I want them outta there
by tomorrow morning!

20:55.600 --> 20:58.300
I can't give 'em a deadline.
I've tried that before.

20:58.433 --> 21:00.300
It doesn't work.
Now, time is on our side--

21:00.433 --> 21:03.467
Time is not on our side.
Now, give them the deadline.
Now.

21:08.200 --> 21:09.500
No.

21:12.067 --> 21:14.167
I won't do that.

21:20.900 --> 21:23.067
Get Koresh on the phone.

21:23.200 --> 21:25.200
Whoa, Tony. What are you doing?

21:25.333 --> 21:27.400
Hey...

21:27.533 --> 21:29.767
[phone ringing]

21:35.167 --> 21:36.200
Hello?

21:36.333 --> 21:38.067
-[Prince] David?
-Yes?

21:38.200 --> 21:40.833
This is Tony Prince,
Special Agent in Charge
for the FBI.

21:42.400 --> 21:44.167
If you don't come out of there
by morning...

21:44.300 --> 21:49.600
certain actions will be taken
against you and your people.

21:51.567 --> 21:53.367
That's not a threat,
it's a promise.

21:53.500 --> 21:54.267
[handset slams]

21:54.400 --> 21:56.167
[line hums]

22:07.067 --> 22:08.433
[music playing]

22:08.567 --> 22:10.767
[announcer]
This is the CBS Evening News.

22:12.167 --> 22:13.600
Good evening,
Dan Rather reporting.

22:13.733 --> 22:16.167
That heavily-armed cult
in central Texas

22:16.300 --> 22:17.767
is showing no signs
of surrender.

22:17.900 --> 22:20.400
Indeed, it shows all signs
of defiance.

22:20.533 --> 22:23.933
Vicki Mabrey is on the scene
covering for us near
Waco, Texas.

22:24.067 --> 22:27.067
[Mabrey] The standoff outside
the Branch Davidian compound

22:27.133 --> 22:29.067
has become
a psychological power struggle

22:29.167 --> 22:32.467
between federal agents
and cult leader David Koresh.

22:32.600 --> 22:35.167
The FBI is restocking
its own arsenal,

22:35.300 --> 22:37.600
borrowing Abrams tanks
from the defense department.

22:37.733 --> 22:39.967
Now, sources tell CBS News

22:40.100 --> 22:42.667
that federal agents
don't plan to let this
go on indefinitely.

22:42.800 --> 22:44.933
Their frustration level
is very high

22:45.067 --> 22:47.500
and if negotiations
are not more fruitful,

22:47.633 --> 22:50.167
they may take action
by this weekend.

22:50.300 --> 22:53.533
I think we should probably
just prepare everyone
for another attack.

22:53.667 --> 22:55.600
We don't know
they're going to do that.

22:55.733 --> 22:57.333
Yeah, but we don't know
that they're not.

22:57.467 --> 22:59.067
Steve, what do you think
that they are gonna do?

22:59.133 --> 23:00.900
We can just leave.

23:01.067 --> 23:03.900
The minute
we walk out those doors,
we're admitting guilt.

23:04.067 --> 23:06.400
I don't know,
guilt versus death.
Is there a decision?

23:06.533 --> 23:09.067
Yeah. Spending the rest
of your life in jail,

23:09.133 --> 23:10.933
or death. Some decision.

23:11.067 --> 23:12.567
This is why we need a lawyer.

23:12.700 --> 23:14.867
-No offense, Wayne.
-None taken.

23:15.067 --> 23:16.633
[Judy] Well, they barely
gave us milk.

23:16.767 --> 23:18.700
Do you think they're gonna
give us a lawyer?

23:18.833 --> 23:21.700
No, Judy's right.
The chances of that
are as good as them--

23:21.833 --> 23:22.900
[door opening]

23:24.500 --> 23:26.300
Hey, David.

23:27.333 --> 23:28.667
What's going on?

23:29.500 --> 23:32.767
-We're just talking.
-About...?

23:34.233 --> 23:37.600
-About our options.
-Options?

23:37.733 --> 23:39.900
-Mm-hmm.
-[David] Steven...

23:40.067 --> 23:42.933
you of all people know
there's only one option.

23:46.167 --> 23:47.700
Wayne...

23:47.833 --> 23:50.233
you wanna go out there,
be with your family?

23:50.367 --> 23:52.733
Or do you wanna feel
the hand of God?

23:53.633 --> 23:54.633
You are my family, David.

23:57.200 --> 23:59.900
Judy, do you wanna stay
or do you wanna leave?

24:00.733 --> 24:02.867
I don't wanna leave
without you.

24:03.900 --> 24:05.067
Thibodeau?

24:06.233 --> 24:09.400
Go on.
Take the easy way out.

24:11.633 --> 24:13.133
-I...
-[Rachel] David.

24:13.267 --> 24:15.433
You owe it to us to tell us
what you're thinking.

24:15.567 --> 24:18.900
No. I owe you nothing.

24:19.867 --> 24:21.400
[sighs]

24:22.767 --> 24:25.767
You are not the only one
that's suffering here.

24:25.900 --> 24:30.500
-Don't you forget that.
-Don't forget... why we're here.

24:30.633 --> 24:32.600
This is our "withering."

24:34.700 --> 24:37.067
Y'all wanna miss out
on the miracle?

24:39.433 --> 24:41.067
Be my guest.

24:50.233 --> 24:52.400
Get outta my chapel.

24:58.700 --> 25:01.767
Sir, I apologize
for my outburst,
but I'd...

25:02.600 --> 25:06.067
I'd really appreciate
if you'd reconsider
your ultimatum.

25:08.433 --> 25:10.067
Gary, please sit down.

25:15.633 --> 25:17.800
[Prince]
How many kids do you have?

25:18.967 --> 25:21.600
-Three.
-I have two myself.

25:22.367 --> 25:26.800
Your wife, uh...
she understands the job?

25:27.567 --> 25:31.667
Well, she was a secretary
in the Bureau when we met,
so she gets it.

25:31.800 --> 25:33.267
Oh.

25:33.400 --> 25:35.067
My wife, she... [chuckles]

25:35.133 --> 25:40.067
she pretends to get it.
But she doesn't.

25:41.767 --> 25:44.733
-Where did you grow up?
-Atlantic Beach, Florida.

25:44.867 --> 25:46.267
Now, uh, sir,
I'd really like to--

25:46.400 --> 25:47.533
What?

25:47.667 --> 25:50.433
Move this conversation along?

25:52.467 --> 25:54.600
What if I just wanna
sit here and talk?

25:54.733 --> 25:57.933
[chuckles]
For hours?

25:58.067 --> 26:01.167
What if we just talked
and talked, but then,

26:01.300 --> 26:02.967
after all that, I decided

26:03.100 --> 26:06.533
not to give you the response
you came in here looking for?

26:07.833 --> 26:10.067
That would be frustrating,
wouldn't it?

26:11.067 --> 26:14.067
Sir, one of the main principles
I try to teach my students

26:14.167 --> 26:18.500
who wanna be negotiators
is to never, ever start a clock

26:18.633 --> 26:20.733
because it gives the person
on the other end

26:20.867 --> 26:22.800
the opportunity to make
the wrong decision.

26:22.933 --> 26:25.600
We're not
in a classroom here, Gary.

26:25.733 --> 26:27.800
And the principles
that you apply

26:27.933 --> 26:31.567
to hypothetical
situations, well...

26:31.700 --> 26:33.667
they don't always work.

26:33.800 --> 26:36.067
We're at an impasse here.

26:36.133 --> 26:40.967
And your
"trickle-flow-gush"
theory-- albeit a good one--

26:41.100 --> 26:45.200
well... that doesn't
seem to be working either.

26:45.333 --> 26:47.200
So, what's your plan, then?

26:47.333 --> 26:49.367
It's time to apply pressure.

26:49.500 --> 26:53.467
Decker wants to start
implementing psy-ops
to get them out.

26:54.733 --> 26:56.367
You wanna psychologically
torture them?

26:56.500 --> 26:58.100
It's not torture.

26:58.233 --> 27:00.267
It's a safe way to push them.

27:00.400 --> 27:02.633
This is not an FBI-sanctioned
strategy. You do understand
that, right?

27:02.767 --> 27:04.800
Don't think
I haven't thought this through.

27:05.833 --> 27:07.767
I'm in a difficult
position here, Gary.

27:07.900 --> 27:10.700
All right, so, uh, you know...

27:10.833 --> 27:12.800
just for shits and giggles,
let me get this straight.

27:12.933 --> 27:17.667
You wanna take a guy
that we're fairly certain
is unstable to begin with...

27:18.767 --> 27:21.600
and you're gonna attempt
to drive him crazy

27:21.733 --> 27:24.300
with psychological pressure,

27:24.433 --> 27:26.800
in hopes that somehow

27:26.933 --> 27:29.967
that will suddenly
make him more reasonable?

27:31.967 --> 27:36.067
You've been requesting
an open flow of communication
since you got here.

27:38.333 --> 27:40.233
I just gave it to ya.

27:46.267 --> 27:47.900
[Gary] My commander, David,
I spoke to him.

27:48.067 --> 27:50.167
He's not gonna back down
on this ultimatum.

27:50.300 --> 27:53.867
[David] Yeah, well,
we're not backing down
either, Gary.

27:55.633 --> 27:57.067
David, I'm gonna try
something here.

27:57.133 --> 27:59.067
I wanna talk to ya

27:59.133 --> 28:02.267
not like "Gary,
the FBI agent," but...

28:02.400 --> 28:04.233
like I was your friend.

28:04.367 --> 28:07.333
And I want you to listen
to what I'm gonna say.

28:08.267 --> 28:11.600
As if a friend
was saying it to you.

28:14.300 --> 28:15.600
[Gary] Come out.

28:16.367 --> 28:19.067
Just come out
before it gets any worse.

28:20.700 --> 28:23.433
That's my friendly advice.

28:23.567 --> 28:26.100
I appreciate that, Gary.

28:26.233 --> 28:29.100
And I want this to be over
just as much as you do.

28:29.233 --> 28:31.600
You think I like
being in this place like this?

28:31.733 --> 28:33.767
I don't. It's awful.

28:33.900 --> 28:37.433
[David] You have
no idea what I'd give to have
a hot shower right now.

28:37.567 --> 28:39.667
It can be over, David.

28:40.433 --> 28:43.633
You have the ability
to make it be over.

28:43.767 --> 28:45.867
I'm trying.

28:46.067 --> 28:48.433
I'm trying to connect with God.

28:48.567 --> 28:51.167
And I'm not just giving you
the runaround either, Gary.

28:51.300 --> 28:52.833
I know.

28:54.500 --> 28:59.300
Well, I just want you
to know, whatever happens
from here on out...

28:59.433 --> 29:01.733
I'm trying, too.

29:03.267 --> 29:04.833
I know you are.

29:05.633 --> 29:07.267
I know.

29:10.367 --> 29:12.233
[line clicks]

29:13.767 --> 29:15.133
[crickets chirping]

29:17.233 --> 29:19.067
[drumming]

29:20.200 --> 29:22.200
-[cymbal rings]
-Okay, yeah.

29:23.067 --> 29:24.600
[Thibodeau]
All right. It's almost bedtime.

29:24.733 --> 29:26.800
But before you go,
I have something for you.

29:26.933 --> 29:28.600
[Serenity] What is it?

29:28.733 --> 29:30.533
Happy birthday.

29:30.667 --> 29:33.700
Go ahead, make a wish,
and blow it out.

29:33.833 --> 29:35.133
[puffs]

29:35.267 --> 29:36.533
[Michelle]
What's going on here?

29:37.300 --> 29:39.400
Uh, we're just having
a little party.

29:39.533 --> 29:40.633
Because it's my birthday.

29:40.767 --> 29:43.667
I know it is. [chuckles]

29:43.800 --> 29:45.133
It's time to go to bed,
all right?

29:45.267 --> 29:47.067
Wait. She has to open
her present first.

29:50.767 --> 29:53.833
[Michelle gasps]
Wow. It's so pretty.

29:53.967 --> 29:56.067
-What is it?
-It's a drum key.

29:56.867 --> 29:58.133
If you're gonna be
a rock star someday,

29:58.267 --> 30:00.667
gotta know how to tune
a drum, right?

30:00.800 --> 30:03.900
-Hmm.
-[Thibodeau] You like it?

30:04.033 --> 30:05.400
-Yeah.
-[Michelle] What do you say?

30:05.533 --> 30:08.667
-Thank you, Thibodeau.
-Aw, you're welcome.

30:09.933 --> 30:11.533
-[lights click]
-[Michelle gasps]

30:11.667 --> 30:13.100
[Serenity] What's happening?

30:18.667 --> 30:19.833
Light 'em up, boys.

30:23.100 --> 30:25.167
[Thibodeau]
It's okay. It's okay.

30:25.300 --> 30:27.333
It's okay.

30:29.267 --> 30:31.133
[loud screeching]

30:31.267 --> 30:33.967
[buzzing, whining]

30:34.767 --> 30:37.500
[distant rattling, honking]

[thunder continues]

31:53.500 --> 31:56.367
[rain pattering]

31:57.267 --> 31:59.733
No, no, I'm sorry.
Please don't put words
in my mouth.

31:59.867 --> 32:02.967
The FBI has no comment
at this time. Next question.

32:03.100 --> 32:05.500
Is there a consideration
to use psychological warfare?

32:05.633 --> 32:07.067
Have you discussed it at all?

32:07.167 --> 32:09.067
I don't even know
what psychological warfare is.

32:09.167 --> 32:11.267
Well, it was reported
that you're playing loud music

32:11.400 --> 32:13.667
and shining bright lights
on the compound all night

32:13.800 --> 32:15.333
to try to agitate the group.

32:15.467 --> 32:17.900
Yeah, I cannot discuss tactics
of that sort, but I'd say

32:18.067 --> 32:20.400
there's minimal chance
that we would get up to
that sort of activity.

32:20.533 --> 32:22.900
When are you gonna
allow the parents to intervene
and talk to our children?

32:23.067 --> 32:25.600
Well, that is not something
we're comfortable doing
at the moment.

32:25.733 --> 32:28.733
Why? Why? How can it hurt
for our voices to get in there?

32:28.867 --> 32:32.533
We know our children.
We should be speaking
to our children.

32:32.667 --> 32:34.967
-Ma'am, there's a protocol--
-[snaps] Screw your protocol!

32:35.100 --> 32:37.533
I want to talk to my son!

32:37.667 --> 32:38.833
-Ma'am--
-Everybody here,

32:38.967 --> 32:40.733
all of these families here,

32:40.867 --> 32:42.200
we don't wanna
just stand around--

32:42.333 --> 32:44.467
-Is there security?
-and just figure out

32:44.600 --> 32:46.267
that we've waited too long?
I don't want...

32:46.400 --> 32:48.333
-a dead son on my hands!
-[Prince] Security, please!

32:48.467 --> 32:50.533
Let me talk to my son!
Let us talk to our children!

32:50.667 --> 32:54.900
I think that's going to
do it for today. Thank you.

32:55.733 --> 32:58.067
[thunder rumbling]

32:59.333 --> 33:01.433
[rain pattering]

33:03.400 --> 33:04.667
[faint knocking on door]

33:05.500 --> 33:09.167
I filled a bunch of glasses.
I figured I'd bring one
over for Serenity.

33:10.500 --> 33:11.800
Thank you.

33:11.933 --> 33:13.300
You're welcome.

33:16.667 --> 33:18.167
How you guys doing?

33:18.300 --> 33:20.333
It's freezing.

33:20.467 --> 33:22.800
I have an extra blanket.
I'll run and grab it.

33:22.933 --> 33:24.267
Wait, Thibs.

33:28.700 --> 33:30.733
You're the best.

33:38.500 --> 33:40.067
Be right back.

33:44.700 --> 33:46.067
[clicking]

33:48.967 --> 33:51.067
-[sniffles]
-[Steve] Wayne?

33:51.133 --> 33:53.100
Get that generator working yet?

33:53.967 --> 33:55.967
Looks like it's gonna be
another cold one tonight.

33:56.733 --> 33:59.833
I've taken it apart and
put it back together twice.

34:00.067 --> 34:02.100
I still can't figure out
what's wrong with it.

34:02.233 --> 34:03.767
Do you mind if I have a look?

34:04.533 --> 34:06.200
I'll take all the help
I can get.

34:13.333 --> 34:14.433
[raps]

34:18.567 --> 34:19.900
Come on in.

34:25.767 --> 34:28.167
[sighs] How you doing?

34:28.300 --> 34:30.067
Good.

34:30.200 --> 34:34.100
I was just checking in on you,
see if you're okay.

34:35.800 --> 34:37.200
What's wrong?

34:38.967 --> 34:40.867
Um...

34:43.100 --> 34:45.133
I don't wanna die
in here, David.

34:47.833 --> 34:50.067
I know I might.

34:50.833 --> 34:54.067
And-and maybe
that's God's will, but...

34:55.067 --> 34:57.067
I don't want to.

34:59.067 --> 35:01.400
I wish I had three more years
with you.

35:01.533 --> 35:04.100
Three more years
to teach you the message.

35:04.233 --> 35:05.967
Who's to say you won't?

35:06.100 --> 35:08.933
The way things are going,
I think it's clear.

35:09.067 --> 35:11.067
We're going home.

35:11.133 --> 35:13.267
One way or another, Thibs.

35:17.767 --> 35:19.133
Uh...

35:19.267 --> 35:20.867
Michelle and Serenity...

35:23.433 --> 35:25.233
What about 'em?

35:27.533 --> 35:29.567
If I decide to go...

35:30.867 --> 35:32.433
will you let them leave with me?

35:33.233 --> 35:35.300
[faint chuckle]

35:37.467 --> 35:39.467
Hm.

35:39.600 --> 35:41.067
[sighs]

35:43.067 --> 35:45.267
Your mother.

35:45.400 --> 35:48.400
She sure struck a nerve
with you, didn't she?

35:49.767 --> 35:52.067
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

35:53.433 --> 35:55.533
They have a way of doing that.

36:00.700 --> 36:02.800
And it would pain me,

36:02.933 --> 36:06.467
but I would not hold it
against you if you wanted
to go join her.

36:08.467 --> 36:10.967
But Michelle?

36:11.833 --> 36:13.233
And Serenity?

36:16.433 --> 36:20.467
That is my wife...
and my daughter.

36:24.167 --> 36:27.300
They are mine... to protect.

36:28.567 --> 36:30.467
Not yours.

36:33.267 --> 36:35.333
You understand?

36:37.533 --> 36:39.433
[faintly] Mm-hmm.

36:55.700 --> 36:57.633
[TV reporter] Sources
near the scene are reporting

36:57.767 --> 37:00.367
that the FBI's main concern
right now is a mass suicide.

37:00.500 --> 37:04.067
Authorities feel
Koresh has become unstable
in the last few days

37:04.133 --> 37:06.300
and they worry
about what he might do.

37:06.433 --> 37:07.800
[male reporter]
A lightning storm--

37:07.933 --> 37:09.500
[remote clicks]

37:10.367 --> 37:12.267
[knocking on door]

37:21.600 --> 37:25.933
I ran outta money for gas.
My car is freezing.

37:26.067 --> 37:29.800
-May I come in?
-Yes. Please.

37:29.933 --> 37:31.500
[thunder rumbles]

37:34.867 --> 37:36.267
[Steve] All right, Thibs.

37:37.200 --> 37:38.467
I'm ready when you are.

37:39.433 --> 37:41.233
[inhales]

37:42.133 --> 37:44.400
Hi, Mom. It's me.

37:45.233 --> 37:47.433
I saw you on the news
the other night.

37:48.600 --> 37:51.533
I know this is hard on you.
I'm sorry.

37:54.533 --> 37:56.500
I just want you to know
I'm okay.

37:58.267 --> 38:00.567
I'm not being held
against my will.

38:01.600 --> 38:05.833
I can come out whenever I want.
But...

38:05.967 --> 38:10.633
this is something
I-- I thought about
a lot, and...

38:12.133 --> 38:14.367
I need to see this through.

38:15.567 --> 38:17.733
'Cause people here...

38:17.867 --> 38:19.633
they're counting on me.

38:20.400 --> 38:23.700
[Thibodeau]
I can't leave them behind, so...

38:28.267 --> 38:30.367
[voice quavers]
I hope you understand.

38:32.467 --> 38:34.500
I really love you, Mom.

38:36.067 --> 38:37.500
I hope-- [clears throat]

38:38.267 --> 38:40.200
hope to see you soon.

38:47.767 --> 38:49.667
[crickets chirping]

38:52.067 --> 38:54.467
[popping]

38:56.400 --> 38:59.167
-Hey, help me hang this blanket.
-[Thibodeau] Yeah.

39:00.067 --> 39:02.133
[grunts]
Can you get that side?

39:02.267 --> 39:05.167
-Hang this up.
-[recording screeches]

39:08.333 --> 39:10.500

[whirring]

39:58.100 --> 39:59.267
[sighs]

40:07.400 --> 40:12.233
What's it gonna take
to get you to start seeing
them as people?

40:12.367 --> 40:14.167
I see 'em as people.

40:15.567 --> 40:17.533
Just not the kind
I ever wanna be around again.

40:17.667 --> 40:19.167
Hm.

40:21.467 --> 40:24.900
Have you noticed...
that not a single person
has come out

40:25.033 --> 40:28.067
since you started
screwing around with them?
What does that tell ya?

40:28.200 --> 40:30.300
I don't know.

40:30.433 --> 40:32.533
That they're a bunch
of stubborn sons of bitches?

40:32.667 --> 40:33.667
[Gary scoffs]

40:36.833 --> 40:40.233
History's not
gonna be on your side
with this one, Mitch.

40:43.533 --> 40:45.367
I'll take the other side
of that bet.

40:45.500 --> 40:48.000
Just stand down, okay?
For a few days.

40:48.133 --> 40:52.267
Turn the power back on.
And give them...

40:53.033 --> 40:55.033
a moment to start
thinking straight again.

40:55.167 --> 40:57.267
That's not my call.
Talk to Prince.

40:57.400 --> 41:00.233
Prince isn't listening to me
anymore, Mitch.

41:01.367 --> 41:03.800
He's listening to you.

41:10.767 --> 41:12.267
Five thousand to one.

41:12.400 --> 41:14.833
Those are the odds against us.

41:14.967 --> 41:18.467
Five thousand people
to every one officer of the law.

41:21.200 --> 41:23.767
You know how we keep order
with those odds?

41:23.900 --> 41:27.300
Because they believe
we're more powerful than we are.

41:27.433 --> 41:29.100
We project strength.

41:29.233 --> 41:31.733
And the people believe
in that strength.

41:35.400 --> 41:39.667
So when we sit outside
a place like this,

41:39.800 --> 41:41.467
for weeks on end,

41:42.267 --> 41:44.567
waiting for them to tire...

41:45.767 --> 41:49.100
we look weak
in front of the rest
of the whole world.

41:49.233 --> 41:53.800
And every angry asshole
with a bomb kit starts
getting ideas.

41:54.667 --> 41:57.567
This is more
than a situation now, Gary.

41:59.133 --> 42:00.667
This is a symbol.

42:03.567 --> 42:07.367
Are we the kind of agency
that coddles cop killers?

42:09.500 --> 42:12.400
Or are we the goddamn FBI?

42:20.067 --> 42:22.700
[recording shrieks, squeals]

42:25.067 --> 42:26.900
-[sputters]
-[sighs]

42:29.567 --> 42:30.600
Come on.

42:31.367 --> 42:34.200
-[sputters, whirrs]
-Whoo!

42:34.333 --> 42:36.700
Yeah!

42:36.833 --> 42:39.467
[laughing]

42:41.067 --> 42:42.900
[David] You did it!

42:43.067 --> 42:45.633
I knew you would!
Great job!

42:46.800 --> 42:48.400
How much gas do we have
in there?

42:49.167 --> 42:51.733
-[Wayne] 10 minutes, tops.
-[recorded honking playing]

42:53.167 --> 42:55.433
I know what I wanna do with it.

42:57.833 --> 43:00.533
[recorded screaming, honking
continues]

43:08.167 --> 43:10.300
Oh, my God.

43:15.900 --> 43:18.267
[beeps]

43:26.367 --> 43:28.933
[keypad beeping]

43:33.133 --> 43:35.233
[line ringing]

43:39.300 --> 43:41.300
[woman] Hello?

43:42.200 --> 43:45.467
-Hi, sis.
-Oh, my God, Steve!

43:45.600 --> 43:48.300
Where are you?
Did you get out of there?

43:48.433 --> 43:50.600
No, I'm still inside.

43:51.367 --> 43:53.700
-I found a phone. And--
-[beeping]

43:53.833 --> 43:56.300
-[sister] Steve?
-You know what? I--

43:56.433 --> 43:59.267
Look, Sue,
I don't have a lot of time.

43:59.400 --> 44:03.600
This thing's beeping at me,
but... listen.

44:04.767 --> 44:07.900
I-- there's been a lot of talk
on the news

44:08.067 --> 44:12.067
and, um, with the FBI,
about us committing suicide
in here.

44:12.200 --> 44:15.433
And I just want you to know,
no matter what they tell you,

44:15.567 --> 44:19.267
that we would never
kill ourselves.

44:19.400 --> 44:21.667
And so,

44:21.800 --> 44:25.900
if we somehow-- I don't know--
if we wind up dead, or--

44:26.067 --> 44:27.900
[phone beeping]

44:28.833 --> 44:32.967
and-- and that's what they're
telling people around the world,

44:33.100 --> 44:36.300
then I just want you to know
that it's a lie.

44:38.067 --> 44:39.700
Okay?

44:41.300 --> 44:43.167
Sue...?

44:43.300 --> 44:45.800
-[beeping]
-Can you hear what I'm--

44:47.867 --> 44:49.967
-[faint thumping]
-[sobbing]

44:53.733 --> 44:56.467
-[music playing]
-[recorded screaming continues]

44:57.333 --> 45:00.533
-[music continues]
-What is that?

45:01.433 --> 45:03.600
What's that sound?

45:03.733 --> 45:05.300
Hey, turn off the speakers.

45:05.433 --> 45:07.833
[distant drumming]

45:08.933 --> 45:10.833
[music continues]

45:12.100 --> 45:15.067
-I thought we cut the power off.
-We did.

45:15.133 --> 45:17.933
[music continues]

45:23.067 --> 45:26.967
* I've been in a cave
For 40 days *

45:27.733 --> 45:31.567
* Only a spark
To light my way *

45:32.367 --> 45:33.967
* I want to give out *

45:34.767 --> 45:36.633
* I want to give in *

45:37.433 --> 45:39.400
* This is our crime *

45:39.533 --> 45:41.333
* This is our sin *

45:41.467 --> 45:43.833
* Oh, I still believe! *

45:47.933 --> 45:49.967
[music continues]

45:55.067 --> 45:57.067
[music continues]

46:06.700 --> 46:08.533
[music continues]

46:09.433 --> 46:10.700
If we were to go in...

46:10.833 --> 46:12.067
[David]
* But I still believe... *

46:12.200 --> 46:14.267
What would that look like?

46:15.067 --> 46:17.900
[Mitch] I could have a plan
on your desk by morning.

46:18.067 --> 46:21.733
-* Through the heartache... *
-Get it to me.

46:22.500 --> 46:26.700
* Through the waiting,
Through the years *

46:26.833 --> 46:28.800
* For people like us *

46:29.567 --> 46:31.667
* In places like this *

46:31.800 --> 46:36.300
* We need all the hope
That we can get *

46:36.433 --> 46:38.667
* Oh, I still believe! *

46:53.300 --> 46:54.700
[music ends]
