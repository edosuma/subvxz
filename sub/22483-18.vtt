TYLER: <i>You guys insisted</i>
<i>we take our finances seriously,</i>

00:11.083 --> 00:12.667
and renting out the tiny house
is the perfect way

00:12.750 --> 00:13.875
for us to pay off our debt.

00:13.959 --> 00:16.583
Uh, where are you two

00:16.667 --> 00:18.834
Our friend Cheese
is paying us to house-sit

00:18.917 --> 00:21.125
until he finds what he's
looking for in Thailand.

00:21.208 --> 00:23.959
Well, I guess you guys

00:21.208 --> 00:23.959
have given this some thought.

00:24.041 --> 00:27.208
We have. Oh, and if you ever

00:24.041 --> 00:27.208
want a night away,

00:27.291 --> 00:28.542
we're marketing it

00:27.291 --> 00:28.542
as a tiny escape

00:28.625 --> 00:29.959
from your big problems.

00:30.041 --> 00:32.041
Well, my big problem is that

00:30.041 --> 00:32.041
my son and his wife

00:32.125 --> 00:34.458
-have a tiny house

00:32.125 --> 00:34.458
in my backyard.

00:32.125 --> 00:34.458
-Yeah.

00:34.542 --> 00:38.166
-Yeah, then this escape

00:34.542 --> 00:38.166
might not be for you.

00:34.542 --> 00:38.166
-No.

00:41.458 --> 00:43.792
-(sighs)

00:43.875 --> 00:46.500
Scam call.

00:43.875 --> 00:46.500
It's just like that porn site

00:46.583 --> 00:48.000
that started billing us

00:46.583 --> 00:48.000
for a membership

00:48.083 --> 00:49.792
we never even signed up for.

00:49.875 --> 00:51.959
Yeah, that was weird.

00:53.667 --> 00:55.667
(door opens,

00:53.667 --> 00:55.667
shuts in other room)

00:55.750 --> 00:57.583
(whispering):

00:55.750 --> 00:57.583
Someone's in the house.

00:57.667 --> 00:59.458
No, they're not.

00:57.667 --> 00:59.458
You always think there's

00:59.542 --> 01:01.333
someone in the house,

00:59.542 --> 01:01.333
and there's never anything.

WOMAN:

01:01.417 --> 01:02.375
Does anyone live in this house?

01:02.458 --> 01:03.667
Someone's in the house!

01:05.166 --> 01:06.458
Mother...

01:06.542 --> 01:08.000
(gasps) Hi.

01:08.083 --> 01:09.834
Sorry, I didn't know which

01:08.083 --> 01:09.834
of these doors

01:09.917 --> 01:11.333
was the soaking tub.

01:11.417 --> 01:13.000
Who the hell are you?

01:13.083 --> 01:14.417
I'm Mavis.

01:14.500 --> 01:16.083
I'm renting the tiny house.

01:16.166 --> 01:18.417
-Tiny house is outside.

01:16.166 --> 01:18.417
-Yeah.

01:18.500 --> 01:19.959
-Unless it rolled away.

01:18.500 --> 01:19.959
-Again...

01:20.041 --> 01:21.709
No, it's there. It's so cute.

01:21.792 --> 01:23.500
But the listing said

01:21.792 --> 01:23.500
I would have access

01:23.583 --> 01:25.125
to the tub in the main house.

01:25.208 --> 01:26.583
Oh, the listing says that,

01:25.208 --> 01:26.583
does it?

01:26.667 --> 01:28.875
Y-Yeah,

01:26.667 --> 01:28.875
it should not say that.

01:28.959 --> 01:32.041
Oh, well, maybe you should take

01:28.959 --> 01:32.041
that up with the management.

01:32.125 --> 01:34.208
Yeah, the only tub in the house

01:34.291 --> 01:35.709
is in the master upstairs.

01:35.792 --> 01:37.125
Oh. (chuckles)

01:37.208 --> 01:39.250
Oh, thanks.

01:37.208 --> 01:39.250
I would tip you,

01:39.333 --> 01:41.834
but I left my wallet

01:39.333 --> 01:41.834
in my other towel.

01:44.417 --> 01:46.333
-She thinks we work here.

01:44.417 --> 01:46.333
-(door shuts upstairs)

01:46.417 --> 01:48.792
I think I didn't flush.

01:50.125 --> 01:51.542
I cannot believe that you guys

01:51.625 --> 01:53.458
told this woman she

01:51.625 --> 01:53.458
could use our tub.

01:53.542 --> 01:55.000
Look,

01:53.542 --> 01:55.000
that's just good marketing.

01:55.083 --> 01:56.417
We had to get creative

01:55.083 --> 01:56.417
with the listing

01:56.500 --> 01:57.625
to set us apart.

01:57.709 --> 01:59.000
Yeah, Mavis could have rented

01:59.083 --> 02:00.959
any tiny house,

01:59.083 --> 02:00.959
but she chose ours.

02:01.041 --> 02:02.959
Yeah, yeah, she did,

02:01.041 --> 02:02.959
because you say here

02:03.041 --> 02:05.250
that there is a nightly

02:03.041 --> 02:05.250
turndown service.

02:05.333 --> 02:06.625
Who do you think

02:05.333 --> 02:06.625
is gonna do that?

02:06.709 --> 02:08.458
Sophia.

02:08.542 --> 02:10.458
What? It said

02:08.542 --> 02:10.458
"tips encouraged,"

02:10.542 --> 02:12.000
so I took a gamble.

02:12.083 --> 02:13.583
Okay, I cannot believe

02:12.083 --> 02:13.583
that you dragged

02:13.667 --> 02:15.000
your little sister into this.

02:15.083 --> 02:17.166
Okay, don't worry,

02:15.083 --> 02:17.166
we'll take care of it

02:17.250 --> 02:18.875
and make sure she

02:17.250 --> 02:18.875
doesn't bother you again.

02:18.959 --> 02:20.375
Fine.

02:20.458 --> 02:22.333
And?

02:22.417 --> 02:23.875
What?

02:23.959 --> 02:25.959
You're proud of us?

02:28.083 --> 02:29.709
(knocking on door)

02:29.792 --> 02:32.542
MAVIS:
Hello? (chuckles)

02:29.792 --> 02:32.542
Can someone help me?

02:32.625 --> 02:34.375
Oh. Mavis...

02:34.458 --> 02:37.041
-Oh, my gosh, what happened?
-Hi.

02:37.125 --> 02:40.959
Okay, the sprinkler's shooting
directly into the tiny house.

02:41.041 --> 02:42.458
It is like the <i>Titanic </i>in there,

02:42.542 --> 02:44.166
but without a hot guy
or an old lady.

02:44.250 --> 02:47.041
-Yeah, 'cause we're in here.
-Oh, thanks a lot, Tim.

02:47.125 --> 02:49.333
I've been meaning to tell you
that the faucet drips,

02:49.417 --> 02:51.083
but now everything's dripping.

02:51.166 --> 02:53.250
Okay, well, listen, you know
what-- oh, you're so wet.

02:53.333 --> 02:56.875
Actually, you should call
Tyler and Clementine,

02:56.959 --> 02:59.000
because
it's their responsibility.

02:59.083 --> 03:01.917
Oh, aren't you
the on-site caretakers?

03:02.000 --> 03:03.500
Okay, you know what?
This is ridiculous.

03:03.583 --> 03:04.625
I'm calling Tyler.

03:04.709 --> 03:05.917
I'm assuming
you're not gonna need

03:06.000 --> 03:07.583
turndown service tonight.

03:07.667 --> 03:08.792
-(phone vibrating)
-MAN (on TV): <i>Antarctica...</i>

03:08.875 --> 03:10.709
Oh, my God, it's my mom.

03:10.792 --> 03:12.834
I'm too messed up to talk
to her.

03:12.917 --> 03:15.250
-You have to talk to her.
-To who?

03:15.333 --> 03:18.041
-To my mom.
-HEATHER: <i>Tyler. I-I know,</i>

03:15.333 --> 03:18.041
<i>I'm your mom.</i>

03:18.125 --> 03:19.834
Oh, shoot, uh, hello?

03:19.917 --> 03:21.583
Tyler, listen. Mavis is here.

03:21.667 --> 03:24.125
She's... Hi, yeah.
She's soaking wet.

03:24.208 --> 03:25.542
<i>The sprinkler is broken.</i>

03:25.625 --> 03:27.583
You need to come over here
and fix this.

03:27.667 --> 03:28.834
Wait, is it water?

03:28.917 --> 03:31.792
Mm, no, it's an energy drink.

03:31.875 --> 03:33.250
Way better for you.

03:33.333 --> 03:36.250
Uh, we, will...
we will take care of it.

03:36.333 --> 03:38.250
Okay, so you're-you're coming
over here right now?

03:38.333 --> 03:39.417
<i>Yeah.</i>

03:39.500 --> 03:40.500
We are on our way.

03:40.583 --> 03:41.875
Uh, what's the address?

03:41.959 --> 03:43.500
Oh, my God. Are you high?

03:43.583 --> 03:46.333
No, but Clementine is.

03:46.417 --> 03:48.500
I said that you were crying.

03:48.583 --> 03:51.125
Am I?

03:52.250 --> 03:54.458
Where were you last night?

03:54.542 --> 03:56.166
You were supposed to come
over and fix the sprinkler.

03:56.250 --> 03:57.458
Yeah.
Sorry we missed your call,

03:57.542 --> 03:58.500
we were sleeping.

03:58.583 --> 04:01.542
I-I talked to you.

04:01.625 --> 04:04.041
You said you were
on your way over.

04:04.125 --> 04:05.834
I said that?

04:05.917 --> 04:07.834
No, no, <i>he </i>said that.

04:07.917 --> 04:09.333
Ugh!

04:09.417 --> 04:11.375
Guys, come on.

04:11.458 --> 04:13.458
You said you were gonna
be responsible for this.

04:13.542 --> 04:15.125
Your dad and I have
done everything.

04:15.208 --> 04:17.333
-Yeah. So I fixed the sprinkler.
-Yes.

04:17.417 --> 04:19.917
And I moved all the cars
so Mavis had a place to park.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.667
And I even turned
the tiny house around

04:21.750 --> 04:23.125
so the sun wouldn't
shine in in the morning

04:23.208 --> 04:24.959
and wake her up, and I made

04:25.041 --> 04:26.875
three different
dinner reservations.

04:26.959 --> 04:29.375
Then I had to highlight a map
with directions to Six Flags.

04:29.458 --> 04:32.166
Heather,
name all the things you did.

04:32.250 --> 04:35.041
Uh, um... wow.

04:35.125 --> 04:36.625
I'm just saying wow
'cause it's a lot.

04:36.709 --> 04:38.875
-It's that-- all of that...
-Right.

04:38.959 --> 04:41.291
...and then... more.

04:41.375 --> 04:42.750
-Very good.
-Thank you.

04:42.834 --> 04:43.875
So, you two

04:43.959 --> 04:45.542
need to get your act together.

04:45.625 --> 04:47.125
Or you and your tenant
are gonna be finding

04:47.208 --> 04:48.333
somewhere else to live.

04:48.417 --> 04:51.709
And we will post
a no-star review

04:51.792 --> 04:53.667
saying that your little
tiny house

04:53.750 --> 04:55.667
is on a burial ground
and Sophia has been dead

04:55.750 --> 04:57.500
for ten years.

04:57.583 --> 04:58.792
You wouldn't.

04:58.875 --> 05:01.500
-Yep.
-Oh, yeah, we would.

05:02.834 --> 05:04.208
Oh, I feel like

05:04.291 --> 05:07.792
our talk with Tyler and Clem
really worked.

05:07.875 --> 05:09.750
They fixed the sprinkler,

05:09.834 --> 05:11.750
and not just, like,
threw an outdoor cushion

05:11.834 --> 05:13.291
on it, fixed it all half-assed.

05:13.375 --> 05:15.250
I mean, they, like,
really fixed it.

05:15.333 --> 05:17.750
-You told me to use the cushion.
-(door opens, shuts)

05:17.834 --> 05:19.834
Great news. Mavis gave us
a five-star review.

05:19.917 --> 05:22.625
-Oh...
-She said, "You can't beat

05:22.709 --> 05:24.792
their tiny house-pitality."

05:24.875 --> 05:27.375
(chuckles) Well,
I am very proud of you two.

05:27.458 --> 05:29.291
(sighs) Thank you.

05:29.375 --> 05:31.250
Now, was that so hard?

05:31.333 --> 05:32.834
TYLER:
And we're really sorry

05:32.917 --> 05:34.917
about, uh, putting
all the responsibility

05:35.000 --> 05:36.208
on you before.

05:36.291 --> 05:37.291
Oh, you two...

05:37.375 --> 05:39.166
Oh, you didn't have to do that.

05:39.250 --> 05:41.000
I mean, you two acting
like grown-ups,

05:41.083 --> 05:43.041
that is gift enough.

05:43.125 --> 05:44.500
Let's see what you got us.

05:44.583 --> 05:45.750
Oh, no, no,
this isn't a gift,

05:45.834 --> 05:47.333
this is our living room.

05:47.417 --> 05:48.792
We're moving back in with you.

05:48.875 --> 05:51.041
Yeah. Mavis loved
our tiny house so much

05:51.125 --> 05:52.542
that she booked it
for six months.

05:52.625 --> 05:54.208
-(laughter)
-Heather, what's happening?

05:54.291 --> 05:55.500
-Come on.
-HEATHER: Six months...

05:55.583 --> 05:57.667
Works for me.
She tips in cash,

05:57.750 --> 05:59.291
so I don't have
to declare anything.

05:59.375 --> 06:01.709
I don't know...
we'll be okay, we'll be okay...

06:05.709 --> 06:09.333
My art isn't about law
or copyright.

06:09.417 --> 06:11.417
It's about not those things.

06:11.500 --> 06:13.000
Well, Erikson, you did infringe

06:13.083 --> 06:15.250
upon the fast food
company's logo.

06:15.333 --> 06:17.250
Oh, come on.
You cannot own shapes

06:17.333 --> 06:20.667
and letters and creative ways
to put them together.

06:20.750 --> 06:22.000
No, you can. Yeah.

06:22.083 --> 06:23.959
That's literally what a logo is.

06:24.041 --> 06:26.750
But, um, the good news is,
I got them to drop the case.

06:26.834 --> 06:28.792
(sighs, laughs)

06:28.875 --> 06:30.875
How can I ever repay you?

06:30.959 --> 06:32.834
Oh, well, you don't need
to <i>repay </i>me,

06:32.917 --> 06:34.667
you just need to pay me.

06:34.750 --> 06:36.583
Can I pay you with a painting?

06:36.667 --> 06:38.166
What?

06:38.250 --> 06:40.458
Money is so passé.

06:40.542 --> 06:43.083
-Art is the currency
of the woke.

06:40.542 --> 06:43.083
-Uh-huh.

06:43.166 --> 06:44.834
Also, I don't have any money.

06:44.917 --> 06:47.542
Wait, so, like,
an original Erikson?

06:47.625 --> 06:49.166
For what you have done for me--

06:49.250 --> 06:51.000
for the people, as a whole,
who love me--

06:51.083 --> 06:52.792
I will paint whatever you want.

06:52.875 --> 06:54.834
-Wow. Ooh!
-(chuckles)

06:54.917 --> 06:56.583
Well, paint me excited!
(laughing)

06:56.667 --> 06:57.875
-Bring it down.
-Okay.

06:57.959 --> 06:59.667
-Except for birds.
-Oh.

06:59.750 --> 07:01.625
Never ask Erikson to paint
a bird.

07:01.709 --> 07:02.917
Right.

07:04.083 --> 07:06.875
This guy's art is weird.

07:06.959 --> 07:09.959
-Maybe you just don't understand
what he's trying to say.

07:06.959 --> 07:09.959
-Well...

07:10.041 --> 07:12.458
-And you do?
-No, but that's how I know

07:10.041 --> 07:12.458
it's good.

07:12.542 --> 07:14.834
You got to expand your mind,
Greg.

07:14.917 --> 07:17.041
You can't just reject something
'cause you don't understand it.

07:17.125 --> 07:20.458
Well, I don't understand serial
killers and yet I reject them.

07:21.667 --> 07:24.333
Looks like the lawyer
just got lawyered.

07:24.417 --> 07:27.166
Hey, bud. Don't do that.

07:27.250 --> 07:28.208
(doorbell rings)

07:28.291 --> 07:29.375
Okay, that's him.

07:29.458 --> 07:30.834
Listen, honey,

07:30.917 --> 07:32.250
you can't bring up birds.

07:32.333 --> 07:33.834
I have no explanation
for this.

07:33.917 --> 07:35.083
Just don't do it.

07:36.375 --> 07:39.166
-Erikson, hi.
-(chuckles)

07:39.250 --> 07:40.583
Come on in.

07:40.667 --> 07:42.291
Uh, this is my husband, Greg.

07:42.375 --> 07:44.625
He's also a big fan
of your paintings.

07:44.709 --> 07:46.959
-Oh.
-I don't understand them,

07:44.709 --> 07:46.959
which is why I love them.

07:47.041 --> 07:49.041
(laughs) So... (clears throat)

07:49.125 --> 07:51.291
...have you given any thought

07:51.375 --> 07:53.750
-to what you wanted me to paint?
-Yes.

07:53.834 --> 07:55.792
We were thinking
a family portrait.

07:55.875 --> 07:57.500
Well, that is great.

07:57.583 --> 08:00.667
-I would love to get a feel
for you both.

07:57.583 --> 08:00.667
-Mm-hmm.

08:00.750 --> 08:03.625
Would you mind if I just
sat here quietly for 24 hours

08:03.709 --> 08:05.792
and watched you?

08:05.875 --> 08:08.250
Or, uh,

08:08.333 --> 08:11.709
I could just get you
some pictures.

08:11.792 --> 08:14.291
Well, I guess
that could work, too.

08:14.375 --> 08:16.417
-(squeals)
-Yes.

08:16.500 --> 08:18.792
-(chuckles)
-So excited.

08:18.875 --> 08:20.750
Now I know what those
Dutch windmills felt like.

08:20.834 --> 08:23.250
(laughs)
I do not like the Dutch.

08:28.875 --> 08:30.083
I love it.

08:31.208 --> 08:32.792
You knew that I have

08:32.875 --> 08:35.959
that "V" muscle
on my lower stomach

08:36.041 --> 08:38.000
and you never saw me
with my shirt off.

08:38.083 --> 08:40.041
Well, you can put a tiger
in a T-shirt,

08:40.125 --> 08:41.875
but it is still a tiger.

08:41.959 --> 08:43.458
(laughs)

08:43.542 --> 08:44.500
What do you think, Jen?

08:44.583 --> 08:46.917
You're a genius.

08:47.000 --> 08:48.625
I pulled back
the curtain on you

08:48.709 --> 08:49.875
and there you were.

08:49.959 --> 08:51.458
(all chuckle)

08:51.542 --> 08:54.458
Okay, well, um, yes.

08:54.542 --> 08:56.417
So much of that,

08:56.500 --> 08:58.542
and, hey, don't get
into any more trouble

08:58.625 --> 09:02.542
or I'm gonna have to take
ten more of these masterpieces.

09:02.625 --> 09:04.333
(laughs)

09:04.417 --> 09:05.959
I hate it.

09:06.041 --> 09:08.458
It's horrible.
I don't want it in this room.

09:08.542 --> 09:09.750
Come on, honey.

09:09.834 --> 09:11.250
I mean,
don't-don't reject something

09:11.333 --> 09:12.709
'cause you don't understand it.

09:12.792 --> 09:15.917
I understand that I hate it.

09:16.000 --> 09:18.208
(sighs) O-Okay. All right.

09:18.291 --> 09:22.834
Marriage is all about
compromise, so I'll fix this.

09:26.583 --> 09:29.375
No, Greg, this is not a fix.

09:29.458 --> 09:31.542
In our bedroom?

09:31.625 --> 09:33.625
Well, only you and I
will ever see it.

09:33.709 --> 09:36.625
Well, and Renata on Thursdays,
but she's pretty discreet.

09:36.709 --> 09:38.000
She doesn't even speak English.

09:38.083 --> 09:40.125
She doesn't speak English
to you.

09:40.208 --> 09:41.500
MATT:
Hey, Greg?

09:41.583 --> 09:43.959
-Yeah, in the bedroom.
-Is that Matt?

09:44.041 --> 09:46.208
Yeah. You know, he said
he wanted to see the painting,

09:46.291 --> 09:48.709
and I was like, "Yeah, sure, if
you want to come over, I guess."

09:48.792 --> 09:50.458
Hey, man. Where's this painting
you begged me to see?

09:50.542 --> 09:51.875
It's right here.

09:51.959 --> 09:53.250
MATT:
Whoa.

09:53.333 --> 09:54.500
Is that an original Erikson?

09:54.583 --> 09:56.000
Yeah. He's a client.

09:56.083 --> 09:57.166
This is special.

09:57.250 --> 09:59.959
You see the "V"? I'm yoked.

10:00.041 --> 10:01.750
Yeah. We're getting rid of it.

10:01.834 --> 10:04.250
-Wh-Why?
-Oh, I know.

10:04.333 --> 10:07.083
Art is the currency of the woke.
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

10:07.166 --> 10:10.458
No, no, no. Jen, getting rid
of an Erikson right now

10:10.542 --> 10:13.000
would be like getting rid
of an early Basquiat.

10:13.083 --> 10:14.875
You have hit the jackpot.

10:14.959 --> 10:18.208
Yeah. And I may be his muse.

10:18.291 --> 10:19.333
(ringtone plays)

10:19.417 --> 10:20.500
Hello?

10:20.583 --> 10:22.125
FEMALE VOICE:
<i>This is IRS Officer Richardson.</i>

10:22.208 --> 10:25.041
Okay, this is an IRS scam call
that I'm gonna take

10:25.125 --> 10:27.792
'cause it's preferable
to looking at this picture,

10:27.875 --> 10:29.083
but please get rid of it.

10:32.917 --> 10:35.917
-We just wanted to have you
over to thank you.

10:32.917 --> 10:35.917
-(gasps)

10:36.000 --> 10:39.000
It-It's really so lovely
in this room.

10:39.083 --> 10:42.291
That is sexy.

10:42.375 --> 10:46.375
Wow. Uh, I can't believe
it's-it's in here.

10:46.458 --> 10:49.083
Mom, I thought I told you
to put it in your bedroom.

10:49.166 --> 10:51.375
I couldn't sleep with it
in the bedroom.

10:51.458 --> 10:52.458
(laughing):
Neither could I.

10:52.542 --> 10:54.583
Oh, my God.

10:54.667 --> 10:58.000
Dead sexy.

11:08.375 --> 11:12.125
So, then my mom was like, "Where
do all your missing socks go?"

11:12.208 --> 11:13.458
And that got me wondering.

11:13.542 --> 11:15.375
What if the socks aren't lost?

11:15.458 --> 11:18.417
What if they go to a dryer
vent portal to another dimension

11:18.500 --> 11:20.542
where socks ruled?

11:20.625 --> 11:23.166
It's called Socktopia.

11:23.250 --> 11:25.083
(laughs)
Listen, it's no secret

11:25.166 --> 11:27.583
that you're at a lower
reading level than us,

11:27.667 --> 11:30.333
but as a storyteller
you're fantastic.

11:30.417 --> 11:32.208
Yeah. So what happens?

11:32.291 --> 11:34.500
All the socks go
into a big dance.

11:34.583 --> 11:36.375
Ooh, is it a sock hop?

11:36.458 --> 11:37.583
No.

11:37.667 --> 11:39.583
Well, that's a misfire.

11:39.667 --> 11:42.375
(bell rings)

11:43.417 --> 11:44.583
-Yeah.
-It's so cute, right?

11:44.667 --> 11:46.000
Oh, so cute. Yeah.

11:46.083 --> 11:47.166
Oh, hey. Why don't you
just run it by Sophia?

11:47.250 --> 11:48.208
She'll tell you if it's good.

11:48.291 --> 11:49.250
What's good?

11:49.333 --> 11:50.792
You remember
your Aunt Colleen and I

11:50.875 --> 11:52.583
wrote that children's book,
<i>The Chicken Who Could Chew?</i>

11:52.667 --> 11:56.166
Yes. You bring it up every time
Mom-Mom serves chicken.

11:56.250 --> 11:58.917
-Okay, so not that often, 'cause
she hardly ever makes chicken.

11:56.250 --> 11:58.917
-Yeah.

11:59.000 --> 12:00.083
I wonder why.

12:00.166 --> 12:01.500
-Okay.
-(clears throat)

12:01.583 --> 12:03.458
Well, anyway, we came up
with a great new idea

12:03.542 --> 12:05.166
for a children's book:

12:05.250 --> 12:07.583
<i>The Chicken</i>
<i>Who Could Chew-Chew.</i>

12:07.667 --> 12:10.208
It's about a chicken
who drives a train.

12:10.291 --> 12:12.458
-Choo-choo.
-Choo-choo.

12:12.542 --> 12:13.959
Yikes.

12:14.041 --> 12:16.333
Original ideas are very
hard to come by, Sophia.

12:16.417 --> 12:18.083
-I'd like to see you
come up with one.

12:16.417 --> 12:18.083
-(scoffs)

12:18.166 --> 12:20.583
Okay. Well...

12:20.667 --> 12:22.625
yesterday I started thinking.

12:22.709 --> 12:24.417
Where do all
the missing socks go?

12:24.500 --> 12:27.792
Mom says they're lost,
but what if they're not?

12:27.875 --> 12:31.291
What if the missing socks travel
through a dryer vent portal

12:31.375 --> 12:32.458
to another dimension

12:32.542 --> 12:34.291
where socks rule

12:34.375 --> 12:35.583
called Socktopia?

12:35.667 --> 12:37.333
-Ooh.
-That's really good.

12:37.417 --> 12:38.875
-I just got full-body chills.
-Yeah.

12:38.959 --> 12:40.333
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I like that one.

12:40.417 --> 12:42.792
I like that way better than
the chicken driving a trolley.

12:42.875 --> 12:44.208
No, no, no, it's a chicken
on a train.

12:44.291 --> 12:45.792
What would a chicken be doing
on a trolley? Heather, shut up.

12:45.875 --> 12:48.041
Oh, you shut up.

12:48.125 --> 12:51.500
So, Sophia, Uncle Matt and I
have been talking,

12:51.583 --> 12:54.500
and we think that your sock idea
would be the perfect follow-up

12:54.583 --> 12:56.166
to <i>The Chicken Who Could Chew.</i>

12:56.250 --> 12:58.583
What happened to <i>The Chicken</i>
<i>Who Could Chew-Chew?</i>

12:58.667 --> 12:59.875
No, no, no,
that was just a joke.

12:59.959 --> 13:01.291
Anyway, we think
it would be really fun

13:01.375 --> 13:02.333
to collaborate with you.

13:02.417 --> 13:04.500
Oh, no. No.

13:04.583 --> 13:06.083
I-It's-it's just a dumb idea.

13:06.166 --> 13:08.166
-What? No, it's not.
-No.

13:08.250 --> 13:10.458
We've all wondered where
those missing socks go.

13:10.542 --> 13:12.291
You're the only person
who's ever figured it out.

13:12.375 --> 13:14.000
COLLEEN:
It's so exciting.

13:14.083 --> 13:15.625
Your original vision
is gonna be turned

13:15.709 --> 13:17.792
into <i>our </i>original vision.

13:17.875 --> 13:19.375
-Yay!
-(whoops)

13:19.458 --> 13:20.834
(chuckles) Yay!

13:20.917 --> 13:22.500
(cheering)

13:22.583 --> 13:24.750
Mmm, okay, sweetie, can you
hand me those potato chips?

13:24.834 --> 13:26.959
It's time
for the secret ingredient

13:27.041 --> 13:30.083
-in Heather's Famous
Chocolate Chip Cookies.

13:27.041 --> 13:30.083
-Hey, Mom?

13:30.166 --> 13:33.000
Don't you use the recipe
on the bag of chocolate chips?

13:33.083 --> 13:34.333
Yeah, sure.

13:34.417 --> 13:36.458
But you call this your recipe.

13:36.542 --> 13:39.208
Well, what makes it mine
is that I double the butter

13:39.291 --> 13:42.458
and then I had
crushed potato chips.

13:42.542 --> 13:44.709
So, if you change a few details

13:44.792 --> 13:46.709
you don't have to feel guilty
about taking someone's idea?

13:46.792 --> 13:47.917
Oh, no.

13:48.000 --> 13:49.417
My Famous Eight-Layer Dip?

13:49.500 --> 13:51.792
Yeah, that's store-bought
seven-layer dip

13:51.875 --> 13:54.041
and then I add
crushed potato chips.

13:54.125 --> 13:57.041
Wait, then what are
Heather's Famous Potato Chips?

13:57.125 --> 13:58.792
I add salt.

14:00.834 --> 14:01.792
COLLEEN:
<i>Do the socks travel</i>

14:01.875 --> 14:03.250
in cars or in shoes?

14:03.333 --> 14:05.083
Ooh, and how about
instead of socks

14:05.166 --> 14:06.709
we make them puppies

14:06.792 --> 14:08.834
on their way to Puppytopia?

14:08.917 --> 14:11.583
That's some slobbery fun
we can all get behind.

14:11.667 --> 14:12.792
Yeah, puppies are
this year's frozen yogurt.

14:12.875 --> 14:14.333
They're played out.

14:14.417 --> 14:17.083
Okay, fine. But you know
what we'd all really love?

14:17.166 --> 14:20.291
-Hmm?
-Puppies that are also fish.

14:20.375 --> 14:21.667
Guppy puppies.

14:21.750 --> 14:22.875
Ew, gross.
Why are you changing it?

14:22.959 --> 14:23.917
What, you don't like socks?

14:24.000 --> 14:25.917
I like socks

14:26.000 --> 14:28.583
because they're in boots
who live in Booty-Town.

14:28.667 --> 14:31.333
That's our story.
I love this back and forth.

14:31.417 --> 14:32.750
-(sighs)
-Booty-Town?

14:32.834 --> 14:35.875
You don't lose boots
in a dryer vent. That's crazy.

14:35.959 --> 14:37.834
You lose boots at a bar.

14:37.917 --> 14:39.208
What?

14:39.291 --> 14:42.583
Uh, yeah. Let's just stick
with your initial vision.

14:45.750 --> 14:46.792
Corbin, wait up.

14:46.875 --> 14:50.041
We need to talk.
I did something awful.

14:50.125 --> 14:51.834
You put the dead gerbil
in my sneaker?

14:51.917 --> 14:53.709
What? Oh, my gosh, no.

14:53.792 --> 14:57.208
Anyway, you remember
that Socktopia story you told?

14:57.291 --> 15:00.250
-Mm-hmm.
-I-I...

15:00.333 --> 15:01.667
I pretended it was mine,

15:01.750 --> 15:04.166
and now my aunt and uncle
are using it for a book.

15:04.250 --> 15:06.083
What?

15:06.166 --> 15:07.917
I-I can't believe
you would do that.

15:08.000 --> 15:10.792
I'm so sorry. I feel awful.

15:10.875 --> 15:11.917
But I promise,

15:12.000 --> 15:14.875
any money that comes my way,
it's yours.

15:14.959 --> 15:18.792
I'll take the money and maybe
I could learn to forgive you.

15:18.875 --> 15:20.208
You liar!

15:20.291 --> 15:21.625
I already apologized, Beverly.

15:21.709 --> 15:24.583
Not you, Corbin.

15:24.667 --> 15:26.750
<i>Socktopia's </i>a book.

15:26.834 --> 15:30.500
<i>Socktopia </i>is already a book?

15:30.583 --> 15:32.875
MATT:
And on the other side

15:30.583 --> 15:32.875
of the dryer vent portal

15:32.959 --> 15:34.834
is a magical land

15:34.917 --> 15:36.291
where socks rule.

15:36.375 --> 15:37.959
<i>Socktopia.</i>

15:38.041 --> 15:41.709
You mean <i>Socktopia,</i>
the popular children's book?

15:43.667 --> 15:46.000
Okay, uh, what about
puppies that are guppies?

15:47.041 --> 15:49.083
Or a chicken
that drives a train?

15:49.166 --> 15:50.417
-Choo-choo.
-(chuckles)

15:55.917 --> 15:58.333
FEMALE VOICE:
<i>This is IRS Officer Richardson</i>

15:58.417 --> 16:01.709
<i>with final notification against</i>
<i>your case for moneys owed.</i>

16:01.792 --> 16:04.709
<i>$5,000 must be wired</i>
<i>to us immediately</i>

16:04.792 --> 16:06.792
<i>or we will come to arrest you.</i>

16:06.875 --> 16:09.500
<i>The wire routing number</i>
<i>for wiring is</i>

16:09.583 --> 16:12.917
<i>177421.</i>

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
<i>Good-bye.</i>

16:15.083 --> 16:18.375
Oh, Tank. Daddy's really
in trouble this time.

16:20.125 --> 16:21.417
-Hey, partner.
-Whoa.

16:21.500 --> 16:22.834
Where you headed?

16:22.917 --> 16:24.792
Oh...

16:24.875 --> 16:27.917
I don't want to worry you,
so I'm not gonna tell you.

16:28.000 --> 16:29.792
What is it? Is someone hurt?

16:29.875 --> 16:31.709
No. It's the IRS.

16:31.792 --> 16:34.417
They're really angry,
but I don't want to worry you.

16:34.500 --> 16:37.166
-The IRS? Are we in trouble?
-Mm.

16:37.250 --> 16:38.667
Real big trouble, yeah.

16:38.750 --> 16:41.792
But, again,
I don't want to worry you.

16:41.875 --> 16:43.500
-But, John...
-Mm-hmm?

16:43.583 --> 16:44.917
We'll just call our accountant.

16:45.000 --> 16:47.625
Celeste is brilliant,
and it's my understanding that,

16:47.709 --> 16:50.125
if we're in trouble,
we can throw her under the bus.

16:50.208 --> 16:54.041
Celeste might not want to take
our call because I-I fired her.

16:54.125 --> 16:56.291
-You fired her? When?
-Mm-hmm.

16:56.375 --> 16:59.291
On her birthday. I didn't know
it was her birthday.

16:59.375 --> 17:02.333
Why? Our taxes
are so easy with her.

17:02.417 --> 17:04.667
Well, that's what made me think
I could do them myself.

17:04.750 --> 17:08.333
See, I called the office, and
she had left early for the day,

17:08.417 --> 17:09.750
which really ticked me off.

17:09.834 --> 17:12.291
Because she left early
on her birthday?

17:12.375 --> 17:16.291
Yeah. But then again,
I, I didn't know that.

17:16.375 --> 17:19.583
We'll just look at our tax
return because the only reason

17:19.667 --> 17:22.917
the IRS would be after us
is if you screwed something up.

17:23.000 --> 17:26.250
It's possible. I did use
the demo version of the program.

17:26.333 --> 17:28.667
The-the deluxe version
was $19.99,

17:28.750 --> 17:31.792
but I guess I could've written
that off, like I did the boat.

17:31.875 --> 17:33.583
Boat?

17:33.667 --> 17:35.291
Oh, I think I know
what I did wrong.

17:35.375 --> 17:37.417
-I'm calling the bank.
-Yeah.

17:37.500 --> 17:39.375
And we're going
to transfer the funds

17:39.458 --> 17:40.750
and that's the end of this.

17:40.834 --> 17:43.166
Then we're gonna take Celeste

17:43.250 --> 17:46.208
to the Cheesecake Factory
to apologize.

17:46.291 --> 17:48.250
I don't think that's
such a good idea, Joan.

17:48.333 --> 17:49.750
They don't take reservations,

17:49.834 --> 17:51.875
but I hear the brown bread
is really good.

17:51.959 --> 17:53.041
Oh, hello.

17:53.125 --> 17:55.208
This is Joan Short calling.

17:55.291 --> 17:58.709
I'm hoping to wire
some money to the IRS.

17:58.792 --> 18:00.250
MAN:
<i>Yes, please hold.</i>

17:58.792 --> 18:00.250
<i>I'll transfer.</i>

18:00.333 --> 18:02.000
What are you doing now?

18:02.083 --> 18:04.583
If the IRS is coming for us,

18:04.667 --> 18:07.041
I'm gonna hide these valuables
for the kids.

18:07.125 --> 18:09.959
The kids...
We've got to call the kids.

18:10.041 --> 18:12.750
No, no, it'd break my heart
to get them involved in this.

18:12.834 --> 18:17.417
You drive me crazy,
and you're the sweetest man.

18:17.500 --> 18:18.875
Give me your ring.

18:18.959 --> 18:21.250
I'm gonna shove it
up Cheeto's butt.

18:21.333 --> 18:22.709
I'll stuff it up there.

18:22.792 --> 18:26.083
Why is this so difficult?
Oh. (laughs)

18:26.166 --> 18:27.917
Merry Christmas, Joanie.

18:28.000 --> 18:29.625
Thank you, honey.

18:29.709 --> 18:30.709
(doorbell rings)

18:30.792 --> 18:32.709
-(gasps)
-(knocking on door)

18:32.792 --> 18:35.750
-It can't be them.
-It is. The IRS. They're here.

18:35.834 --> 18:37.625
-No.
-I want you one last time.

18:37.709 --> 18:38.959
Right now.

18:39.041 --> 18:41.250
You don't even have to finish.

18:41.333 --> 18:42.417
-(knocking continues)
-No.

18:42.500 --> 18:44.667
-(doorbell ringing)
-If it's them, we go.

18:44.750 --> 18:47.709
-Oh.
-I'm done running.

18:47.792 --> 18:49.208
MAN:
<i>Ma'am, are you there?</i>

18:49.291 --> 18:52.208
<i>-Can you hold?</i>
-Oh, yes. Yes, I'll hold.

18:53.583 --> 18:54.834
(knocking on door)

18:54.917 --> 18:56.291
(doorbell ringing)

18:59.875 --> 19:00.834
Heather!

19:00.917 --> 19:02.250
Why do you have the door locked?

19:02.333 --> 19:03.834
The IRS called.

19:03.917 --> 19:06.542
If we don't wire them money
today, they're coming for us.

19:06.625 --> 19:08.625
Oh, no, no, no, no, Mom.
That's a scam.

19:08.709 --> 19:11.083
-A scam?
-Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah.

19:11.166 --> 19:12.291
We get that call all the time.

19:12.375 --> 19:14.583
Listen, if the IRS
wants to get ahold of you,

19:14.667 --> 19:15.834
they do it
through certified mail.

19:15.917 --> 19:17.959
-Are you sure?
-Oh, yeah.

19:18.041 --> 19:21.083
Yeah, because
Tim wired them $5,000,

19:21.166 --> 19:22.375
so that's how we know.

19:22.458 --> 19:24.875
(laughs) What an idiot!

19:32.834 --> 19:36.041
Okay, I re-hired Celeste.

19:36.125 --> 19:38.291
Yeah, well, I learned my lesson.

19:38.375 --> 19:39.333
(laptop chimes)

19:39.417 --> 19:42.041
Oh, boy, it's your nephew.

19:42.125 --> 19:45.625
No, not Mikey.

19:45.709 --> 19:48.125
"I'm sorry for the odd request

19:48.208 --> 19:50.166
"because it might
get to you too urgent.

19:50.250 --> 19:51.875
"I'm stuck in
an Indonesian prison

19:51.959 --> 19:55.834
"and need 2, 000 monies
I can refund

19:55.917 --> 19:58.583
on prompt return to America"?

20:00.917 --> 20:03.250
Oh, I don't know about this.

20:04.375 --> 20:07.166
Offer them a thousand,
see if they go for it.

20:07.250 --> 20:08.625
I'll get my checkbook.

20:08.709 --> 20:12.208
I think this counts
as a tax write-off.

20:12.291 --> 20:14.166
"I'm stuck in monies..."

20:14.250 --> 20:15.750
Oh, Mikey,

20:15.834 --> 20:19.458
if you'd just passed English
in high school.
