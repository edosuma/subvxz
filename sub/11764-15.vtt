WEBVTT

00:02.033 --> 00:06.337
(chuckles)
I CAN'T BELIEVE WE'RE IN NAPA.

00:06.337 --> 00:07.438
OH.
(voice breaks) I'M SORRY.
(chuckles)

00:07.438 --> 00:08.709
IT'S JUST...

00:08.709 --> 00:11.242
WELL, I FEEL LIKE
I'M MEETING GOD. (sighs)

00:11.242 --> 00:12.243
(Ellie) MM.

00:12.243 --> 00:13.644
MM-HMM.

00:13.644 --> 00:17.148
OKAY, GUYS. WE'VE GOT ONE DAY
TO PLAN THIS WEDDING.

00:17.148 --> 00:18.289
CAN YOU WHIP UP A CAKE?

00:18.289 --> 00:19.450
ON IT.

00:19.450 --> 00:21.752
I WANT TO MAKE
AN EXACT CAKE REPLICA

00:21.752 --> 00:23.154
OF THE CUL-DE-SAC,

00:23.154 --> 00:25.256
BECAUSE THAT'S
WHERE YOUR ROMANCE STARTED,

00:25.256 --> 00:28.059
SO I WANT
TO MAKE LITTLE CAKE HOUSES

00:28.059 --> 00:29.130
AND COTTON CANDY BUSHES,

00:29.130 --> 00:31.702
BUT THERE IS ONE THING
THAT I WILL NOT BEND ON.

00:31.702 --> 00:35.236
THE ASPHALT IS ACTUALLY GOING
TO HAVE TO BE ASPHALT.

00:35.236 --> 00:36.737
THERE ARE SOME THINGS
THAT YOU CAN'T FAKE

00:36.737 --> 00:38.169
IN THE CAKE WORLD.

00:38.169 --> 00:39.170
TRUE.

00:39.170 --> 00:42.413
NOW DO YOU THINK,
FOR ONE DAY,

00:42.413 --> 00:44.415
YOU COULD ACTUALLY STAY OUT
OF TROUBLE?

00:44.415 --> 00:46.817
OH, COME ON, J-BIRD.
WE'RE NOT RACCOONS.

00:46.817 --> 00:48.719
THEN WHY ARE YOU
IN THAT WINE BARREL?

00:48.719 --> 00:51.182
I'M GONNA ROLL HIM DOWN
THE HILL.

00:51.182 --> 00:54.085
HEY, DIME EYES. THANK YOU
FOR LETTING US ELOPE WITH YOU.

00:54.085 --> 00:56.387
WELL, THAT'S HOW I LIKE
TO DO MY ELOPEMENTS--

00:56.387 --> 00:57.828
SEVEN PEOPLE DEEP.

00:57.828 --> 00:59.059
EIGHT.
WHAT?

00:59.059 --> 01:00.391
HEY, JUNE BUG.

01:00.391 --> 01:02.293
DAD!
MM. HI.

01:02.293 --> 01:03.534
DAD.
SWEETIE.

01:03.534 --> 01:05.096
(Andy) HEY, HEY.

01:05.096 --> 01:06.837
WHOA!
(thuds)

01:06.837 --> 01:07.798
(grunts)

01:07.798 --> 01:12.743
THIS... ISN'T... AS... FUN...
AS... I... THOUGHT!

01:12.743 --> 01:17.778
в™Єв™Єв™Є

01:17.778 --> 01:20.581
OW, OW, OW, OW, OW, OW, OW!
(inhales deeply)

01:20.581 --> 01:23.614
MY SOCKS SUCK
AS POT HOLDERS.

01:23.614 --> 01:25.456
STILL, IT'S NICE OF THE HOTEL
TO LET YOU USE THEIR KITCHEN

01:25.456 --> 01:27.218
TO BAKE THE WEDDING CAKE.

01:27.218 --> 01:28.519
(lowered voice)
I MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE TOLD THEM

01:28.519 --> 01:30.661
THAT I'M THE NEW PASTRY CHEF.

01:30.661 --> 01:32.523
JUST BE COOL.

01:32.523 --> 01:34.225
(normal voice)
BY THE WAYANS BROTHERS,

01:34.225 --> 01:36.867
I CANNOT BELIEVE THAT TOMORROW
IS YOUR 21st BIRTHDAY!

01:36.867 --> 01:40.231
WELL, SO FAR, EVERY ONE
OF MY BIG BIRTHDAYS HAS SUCKED.

01:40.231 --> 01:42.373
16--I HAD THE CHICKEN POX.

01:42.373 --> 01:43.874
18--MY MOM TOOK ME

01:43.874 --> 01:46.207
TO SEE "HARRY POTTER
AND THE HALF-BLOOD PRINCE."

01:46.207 --> 01:48.609
OH, TRAVIS. THAT'S SO SAD.
(chuckles)

01:48.609 --> 01:49.610
NO, THAT PART WAS AWESOME,

01:49.610 --> 01:50.811
BUT ON THE WAY OUT
OF THE THEATER,

01:50.811 --> 01:53.214
SOME 10-YEAR-OLD POKED ME
IN THE EYE WITH HIS WAND.

01:53.214 --> 01:54.385
I MEAN, WHY DO THEY GIVE
THOSE THINGS OUT?

01:54.385 --> 01:55.386
IT'S SO DANGEROUS.

01:55.386 --> 01:57.218
YOU KNOW,
WADE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE

01:57.218 --> 01:58.549
MY DATE
TO YOUR MOM'S WEDDING

01:58.549 --> 02:00.451
WHEN IT WAS GONNA BE
IN FOUR MONTHS,

02:00.451 --> 02:02.393
BUT NOW I'M SOLO.

02:02.393 --> 02:05.556
WHAT DO YOU SAY WE HAVE,
LIKE, A TRAV-LAURIE

02:05.556 --> 02:09.700
WEDDING DATE/21st BIRTHDAY
BLOWOUT?

02:09.700 --> 02:11.702
DEAL.

02:11.702 --> 02:13.564
HEY, MAGNUM.

02:13.564 --> 02:17.208
YOU WANT TO COME OVER HERE
AND LET ME STOMP ON YOUR GRAPES?

02:17.208 --> 02:20.171
YOU WANT TO STOMP
ON MY BOYS?

02:20.171 --> 02:22.643
(chuckles) IT'S JUST REALLY HARD
TO THINK OF SEXY WINE TALK.

02:22.643 --> 02:24.715
YEAH, WELL,
THEN WHY EVEN TRY?

02:24.715 --> 02:26.317
WHY ARE YOU SO MOPEY?

02:26.317 --> 02:30.751
WHEN I SAID I WANTED
TO ELOPE, JUST US,

02:30.751 --> 02:32.253
I MEANT JUST US.

02:32.253 --> 02:34.755
I KNOW. WE DID IT, BABY!

02:34.755 --> 02:37.258
OKAY, I MEANT JUST US TWO.

02:37.258 --> 02:38.859
ONE, TWO.

02:38.859 --> 02:40.291
HONEY, I THOUGHT YOU MEANT

02:40.291 --> 02:42.763
YOU JUST DIDN'T WANT
A BIG WEDDING,

02:42.763 --> 02:44.935
NOT THAT YOU DIDN'T WANT
THE GANG HERE.

02:44.935 --> 02:47.738
OHH. I'M SO SORRY.

02:47.738 --> 02:52.303
HEY, WHAT IF WE ALL STAY HERE
FOR A FEW DAYS

02:52.303 --> 02:55.306
AND HAVE FUN,
BUT THEN THEY ALL FLY HOME

02:55.306 --> 02:58.209
AND WE STAY AND GET MARRIED
BY OURSELVES?

02:58.209 --> 02:59.810
LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT.

02:59.810 --> 03:02.953
IF I MAKE THE EMPTY GESTURE
OF ASKING THEM TO GO,

03:02.953 --> 03:05.886
WHEN THEY SAY NO,
YOU'LL STILL BE HAPPY?

03:05.886 --> 03:07.218
YEAH.

03:07.218 --> 03:09.390
(chuckles)
THIS IS THE BEST FIGHT EVER.

03:09.390 --> 03:11.562
(both chuckle)

03:11.562 --> 03:14.225
(singsongy) DING-DONG!
(normal voice) IT'S MIDNIGHT!

03:14.225 --> 03:15.396
LET'S GO.

03:20.731 --> 03:22.433
(whispers) OKAY.

03:22.433 --> 03:23.774
WHAT'S GOING ON?

03:23.774 --> 03:25.236
YOU FOUR, GRAB HIM.

03:25.236 --> 03:27.278
WHAT'S HAPPENING?
WAIT. WAIT. WAIT. WAIT.

03:27.278 --> 03:28.909
WHAT--WHAT'S GOING ON?
I DON'T LIKE THIS.

03:28.909 --> 03:30.411
WHY IS NOBODY SAYING ANYTHING?

03:30.411 --> 03:32.543
SOMEBODY TELL ME
WHAT'S HAPPENING!

03:32.543 --> 03:37.248
(all) в™Є HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU в™Є

03:37.248 --> 03:38.749
(inhales deeply)

03:38.749 --> 03:39.920
(blows air)

03:39.920 --> 03:42.553
(cheering)

03:42.553 --> 03:44.825
YOU KNOW, I GOTTA SAY,
I'VE, UH, TRIED WINE BEFORE,

03:44.825 --> 03:47.398
AND... NOT A BIG FAN.

03:47.398 --> 03:48.899
(glass shatters)

03:48.899 --> 03:50.561
MAYBE I CAN LEARN TO LIKE IT.

03:50.561 --> 03:53.564
(cheering)

03:53.564 --> 03:55.406
OF COURSE
I CAN GET A LITTLE ROOM

03:55.406 --> 03:56.937
FOR YOUR FRIEND'S RECEPTION.

03:56.937 --> 03:58.969
(chuckles) OHH.

03:58.969 --> 04:01.272
LOOK, ELLIE...

04:01.272 --> 04:02.413
CAN I CALL YOU "ELLIE"?

04:02.413 --> 04:03.414
"ELLIE" IS GOOD.

04:03.414 --> 04:04.545
(chuckles) ELLIE...

04:04.545 --> 04:08.279
(chuckles) I CAN GET YOU
ANYTHING YOU WANT...

04:08.279 --> 04:09.450
(gasps)
SO IF YOU WANT A GROUP

04:09.450 --> 04:11.882
OF SHAVED BRAZILIAN GIGOLOS
UP IN YOUR ROOM...

04:11.882 --> 04:13.854
(inhales deeply and sighs)
I WILL PICK THEM UP MYSELF.

04:13.854 --> 04:16.427
I'LL BRING MY RAZOR.
I'LL SHAVE 'EM DOWN.

04:16.427 --> 04:17.528
(sighs)

04:17.528 --> 04:20.391
WOW. YOU HAVE
THE MOST AMAZING EYES.

04:20.391 --> 04:22.333
THANKS. (chuckles)
(chuckles)

04:22.333 --> 04:23.864
THAT WAS INAPPROPRIATE.
I'M SORRY.
NO.

04:23.864 --> 04:24.865
(chuckles)

04:24.865 --> 04:27.538
(exhales deeply)

04:28.599 --> 04:31.402
HEY.
WHY ARE YOU ALL FLUSHED?

04:31.402 --> 04:33.043
DON'T BLOCK MY VIEW.

04:33.043 --> 04:34.705
(chuckles)

04:34.705 --> 04:36.046
HI.

04:37.308 --> 04:40.351
OH, YEAH.
THAT GUY WANTS YOU.

04:40.351 --> 04:42.483
I HOPE SO.

04:42.483 --> 04:43.914
WAIT. WHAT'S HAPPENING?

04:46.317 --> 04:48.319
HEY, DAD.

04:48.319 --> 04:50.321
I NEED
TO ASK YOU SOMETHING.

04:50.321 --> 04:51.562
SURE, JUNE BUG.

04:51.562 --> 04:54.995
WASN'T THAT GLASS
JUST EMPTY?

04:54.995 --> 04:56.827
WHEN I GOT HERE,
I GAVE THE BELLHOP $20

04:56.827 --> 04:58.699
TO FILL IT UP
WHENEVER IT WAS EMPTY.

04:58.699 --> 05:00.070
WATCH.
(wine splatters)

05:04.975 --> 05:05.976
(chuckles)

05:05.976 --> 05:07.908
LIKE FATHER, LIKE DAUGHTER.

05:07.908 --> 05:09.580
(clatters)

05:09.580 --> 05:11.482
(laughs)

05:11.482 --> 05:13.414
I WANT TO SHOW YOU HOW TO DO
SOMETHING ONLINE.

05:13.414 --> 05:16.517
NO COMPUTERS. I DON'T TRUST
ANYTHING WITHOUT A SOUL.

05:16.517 --> 05:19.550
THAT'S WHY I DON'T DO
BUSINESS WITH GERMAN PEOPLE.

05:19.550 --> 05:24.395
I WANT YOU TO GO ONLINE AND GET
ORDAINED AS A MINISTER.

05:24.395 --> 05:26.427
DAD, I WANT YOU
TO MARRY US.

05:26.427 --> 05:29.329
(chuckles) OH.
I JUST LOVE YOU SO MUCH...
(chuckles) OHH.

05:29.329 --> 05:31.762
AND--AND I'M SO HONORED
THAT YOU WANT ME TO B-BE--

05:31.762 --> 05:33.934
OH, NO, NO. NO CRYING.
(chuckles)

05:33.934 --> 05:35.936
SEE, THIS IS GONNA BE HARD
FOR YOU,

05:35.936 --> 05:37.868
BUT YOU CAN'T CRY
WHEN YOU MARRY US,

05:37.868 --> 05:40.871
BECAUSE IF YOU CRY,
THEN I'M GONNA START CRYING,

05:40.871 --> 05:42.373
AND I'LL BE WEARING
EYE MAKEUP,

05:42.373 --> 05:46.116
AND I CAN'T GET MARRIED
LOOKING LIKE ALICE COOPER.

05:46.116 --> 05:49.580
(voice breaks) AND I'M GONNA BE
MARRYING OFF MY BABY. (sobs)

05:49.580 --> 05:53.384
(crying) I KNOW.
SEE? NOW I'M COOPERING.

05:53.384 --> 05:54.925
IS THIS WHAT YOU WANT?

05:54.925 --> 05:56.927
NO.

05:56.927 --> 05:59.430
ARTURO, GO GRAB ME SOME VANILLA.

05:59.430 --> 06:02.433
DAMN, GIRL. YOU GOT
THESE PEOPLE IN CHECK.

06:02.433 --> 06:04.435
ARTURO AND I BONDED
BECAUSE WE'RE BOTH REALLY PISSED

06:04.435 --> 06:07.438
THAT MANAGEMENT WON'T LET US
WEAR FLIP-FLOPS IN THE KITCHEN.

06:07.438 --> 06:10.441
(chuckles) THIS IS AWESOME,

06:10.441 --> 06:12.803
AND THE, UH, THE CAKE IS
GONNA LOOK GREAT.

06:12.803 --> 06:14.445
YOU THINK?

06:14.445 --> 06:16.547
'CAUSE I'M NOT GREAT
AT WEDDING CAKES.

06:16.547 --> 06:18.008
DON'T BE MODEST, LAURIE.

06:18.008 --> 06:20.481
YOU'RE THE BEST FAKE PASTRY CHEF
THIS HOTEL'S EVER HAD.

06:20.481 --> 06:23.484
(chuckles) AW. THANK YOU.
HERE. TRY THIS.

06:25.486 --> 06:27.958
(gasps)
OH, NO. WHAT AM I DOING?

06:27.958 --> 06:29.920
MNH-MNH.
(chuckles) WHAT?

06:29.920 --> 06:32.392
HOW DO WE ALWAYS END UP
FLIRTING WITH EACH OTHER?

06:32.392 --> 06:34.565
WE'RE NOT FLIRTING.
THIS IS NOT HOW I FLIRT.

06:34.565 --> 06:35.766
I'M MUCH MORE...

06:35.766 --> 06:37.568
SUBTLE WHEN I FLIRT.
OH, REALLY?

06:37.568 --> 06:39.470
YEAH, I FOLLOW GIRLS TO CLASSES,
MEMORIZE THEIR SCHEDULES

06:39.470 --> 06:41.031
SO I CAN SHOW UP
RIGHT WHEN THEY GET THERE.

06:41.031 --> 06:42.533
(chuckles)

06:42.533 --> 06:43.974
GOOD GOD. I'M A STALKER.

06:43.974 --> 06:48.509
(chuckles) I'M NOT...
TRYING TO FLIRT WITH YOU.

06:48.509 --> 06:50.140
IT JUST...

06:50.140 --> 06:52.513
(whispers) I DON'T KNOW.
IT COULD HAPPEN.

06:52.513 --> 06:55.045
WELL, MAYBE IT'S FATE.

06:55.045 --> 06:57.548
I MEAN, WE'RE HERE...

06:57.548 --> 06:59.049
AT A WEDDING...

06:59.049 --> 07:02.523
ON MY 21st BIRTHDAY,
JUST YOU AND ME...

07:02.523 --> 07:03.624
AND ARTURO.

07:03.624 --> 07:04.995
(laughs)

07:04.995 --> 07:06.426
YOUR BOYFRIEND COULDN'T
MAKE IT.

07:06.426 --> 07:09.600
MY GIRLFRIEND, UH,
DOESN'T EXIST.

07:09.600 --> 07:11.662
(laughs)

07:11.662 --> 07:14.965
WHAT IF THIS IS EXACTLY HOW
IT'S SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN?

07:14.965 --> 07:18.108
LAURIE.

07:18.108 --> 07:20.511
WADE.

07:22.442 --> 07:24.545
YOU GUYS READY
FOR ANOTHER FOUR BOTTLES?

07:24.545 --> 07:25.576
FAT CHANCE. (chuckles)

07:25.576 --> 07:27.147
WHOA. WAIT. WE'RE FINISHED?

07:27.147 --> 07:29.880
NO, I WANT MORE. THAT'S WHY
I SAID, "FAT CHANCE." (chuckles)

07:29.880 --> 07:31.882
IF I DIDN'T WANT MORE WINE,
I WOULD HAVE SAID,

07:31.882 --> 07:33.984
"SLIM CHANCE."
(chuckles) OKAY.

07:33.984 --> 07:35.986
BUT, UH, "FAT CHANCE"
AND "SLIM CHANCE"

07:35.986 --> 07:37.528
MEAN THE SAME THING.

07:37.528 --> 07:38.489
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.
(chuckles)

07:38.489 --> 07:41.061
"FAT" AND "SLIM" ARE
OPPOSITE.

07:41.061 --> 07:43.564
OKAY, CAN WE ALL AGREE
THAT FROM NOW ON,

07:43.564 --> 07:45.766
"FAT CHANCE" MEANS
DEFINITELY?

07:45.766 --> 07:46.997
CHANGE APPROVED.

07:46.997 --> 07:49.640
YOU CAN'T JUST CHANGE
THE MEANING OF PHRASES.

07:49.640 --> 07:52.472
I JUST DID. OKAY, I KNOW
WHAT'S GONNA CHEER YOU UP.

07:52.472 --> 07:54.074
GRAYSON THOUGHT
THAT IT WAS JUST GONNA BE

07:54.074 --> 07:56.106
THE TWO OF US ELOPING.

07:56.106 --> 07:57.107
(chuckles)
EVEN THOUGH

07:57.107 --> 07:59.680
I KNOW YOUR ANSWER...

07:59.680 --> 08:01.752
HOW WOULD YOU FEEL
IF WE ALL HUNG OUT

08:01.752 --> 08:04.484
FOR A FEW DAYS,
AND THEN YOU GUYS LEFT

08:04.484 --> 08:07.558
AND GRAYSON AND I COULD GET
MARRIED ALONE? (chuckles)

08:07.558 --> 08:08.488
LOVE IT.
YEAH.

08:08.488 --> 08:10.521
THAT'S FANTASTIC.

08:10.521 --> 08:12.022
THAT'S JUST
WHAT GRAYSON WANTED...

08:12.022 --> 08:14.965
EVEN THOUGH OUR PICTURES
WILL HAVE NO ONE IN THEM,

08:14.965 --> 08:18.799
AND, UH, MY MEMORIES WILL
FEEL EMPTY. (chuckles)

08:18.799 --> 08:21.672
JULES, WE'RE JUST MESSIN'
WITH YA.

08:21.672 --> 08:23.634
WHY?
LOOK, I KNOW MARRYING YOU

08:23.634 --> 08:26.607
MEANS MARRYING EVERYONE,

08:26.607 --> 08:27.678
SO...

08:29.680 --> 08:31.842
WILL YOU MARRY ME?

08:31.842 --> 08:33.513
BEFORE ANYONE ANSWERS...

08:33.513 --> 08:35.145
COUNCIL.

08:35.145 --> 08:36.516
(clears throat)

08:36.516 --> 08:38.248
(Jules, Andy, Ellie, and Bobby
whisper indistinctly)

08:38.248 --> 08:39.249
OH, OKAY.

08:39.249 --> 08:40.551
(chuckles)
ALL RIGHTY.

08:40.551 --> 08:42.953
(chuckles)
JUST A COUPLE OF CONDITIONS.

08:42.953 --> 08:46.226
ANDY AND BOBBY WANT YOU
TO FINANCE THEIR SHORT FILM.

08:46.226 --> 08:48.228
IT'S CALLED
"BRO-MANCING THE STONE."

08:48.228 --> 08:50.731
ALSO, IN JULES' KITCHEN,
YOU ARE NEVER ALLOWED

08:50.731 --> 08:53.063
TO SIT IN MY CHAIR,
EVEN IF I'M NOT THERE.

08:53.063 --> 08:55.065
YES...
TO EVERYONE BUT ELLIE.

08:55.065 --> 08:57.768
WHERE ARE WE ALL GOING
ON OUR HONEYMOON?
(chuckles)

08:57.768 --> 08:59.239
YEAH!
(laughing)
NO. THAT'S NOT--

08:59.239 --> 09:00.240
(chuckles) I LOVE YOU.
JUST KIDDING.
NOT--NOT FUNNY.

09:00.240 --> 09:01.872
MM.
MM. I'M JUST KIDDING.

09:05.145 --> 09:08.048
OH, I NEVER THOUGHT
I'D GET MY DREAM WEDDING.

09:08.048 --> 09:10.180
HONEY, YOU'VE BEEN
SO GREAT TO ME.

09:10.180 --> 09:11.551
I WISH
THERE WAS SOMETHING SPECIAL

09:11.551 --> 09:13.023
I COULD DO FOR YOU.

09:13.023 --> 09:17.027
MAYBE ON OUR WEDDING NIGHT,
WE CAN FINALLY HAVE ROBE SEX.

09:17.027 --> 09:19.059
WHY DOES THAT TURN YOU ON
SO MUCH?

09:19.059 --> 09:22.793
BECAUSE IT'S LIKE WE'RE MONKS
DOING SOMETHING FORBIDDEN.

09:22.793 --> 09:24.635
(monotone voice, chants)
I WILL SEX...

09:24.635 --> 09:27.037
(deep voice) YOU.

09:27.037 --> 09:30.570
THERE'S GOTTA BE SOMETHING I CAN
DO TO MAKE IT MORE SPECIAL.

09:30.570 --> 09:33.804
I WISH MY DAUGHTER COULD BE
HERE TO SEE US GET MARRIED.

09:33.804 --> 09:35.776
I CAN MAKE THAT HAPPEN.

09:35.776 --> 09:37.077
SURE, JULES. YEAH.

09:37.077 --> 09:40.250
IT'S TOTALLY FINE WITH ME
FOR TAMPA JILL TO FLY TO NAPA,

09:40.250 --> 09:43.113
BUT, UH, THANKS
TO A SUPER SOAKER...

09:43.113 --> 09:44.254
(chuckles)
FULL OF MARGARITAS

09:44.254 --> 09:47.958
AND AN AIR MARSHAL WITH,
LIKE, ZERO SENSE OF HUMOR,

09:47.958 --> 09:50.821
I AM CURRENTLY
ON THE NO-FLY LIST.

09:50.821 --> 09:53.123
(cell phone beeps)
ALL RIGHT.
MINOR SKANK SETBACK,

09:53.123 --> 09:55.095
BUT I'LL STILL MAKE
THIS HAPPEN.

09:55.095 --> 09:57.628
(chuckles)
I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT

09:57.628 --> 10:00.801
WE'RE FINALLY TOGETHER
FACE-TO-FACE.

10:00.801 --> 10:02.703
YOU KNOW WHY
YOU'RE SO AMAZEBALLS?

10:02.703 --> 10:03.704
WHY?

10:03.704 --> 10:06.136
YOU'RE SO... NAKED,

10:06.136 --> 10:08.979
AND I DON'T MEAN, LIKE,
NAKED NAKED.

10:08.979 --> 10:12.012
YOU'RE JUST
SO EMOTIONALLY HONEST.

10:12.012 --> 10:14.044
I MEAN,
BUT DON'T GET ME WRONG.

10:14.044 --> 10:15.846
THE NAKED NAKED STUFF WAS
REAL GOOD, TOO.

10:15.846 --> 10:17.017
(laughs)

10:17.017 --> 10:18.989
IT WAS LIKE YOU HADN'T HAD
SEX IN TEN YEARS,

10:18.989 --> 10:21.922
AND, YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN
WITH SOME EX-CONS...

10:21.922 --> 10:23.654
(chuckles)
SO I KNOW.

10:23.654 --> 10:25.355
YEAH. WE WERE ACTUALLY
PRETTY LOUD LAST NIGHT.

10:25.355 --> 10:27.027
I MEAN, I FEEL REALLY BAD
FOR WHOEVER WAS

10:27.027 --> 10:28.298
IN THE ROOM NEXT TO US.

10:28.298 --> 10:31.101
OH, MY GOD. (laughs)
I DON'T KNOW.

10:31.101 --> 10:35.235
(sighs) THAT WOULD BE ME.

10:35.235 --> 10:37.838
GOOD OLD ROOM 207.

10:37.838 --> 10:39.139
I'M SORRY.
I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE

10:39.139 --> 10:41.141
TO BE SURE SOMEONE'S MEANT
FOR YOU,

10:41.141 --> 10:45.045
AND YET YOU CAN'T BE
WITH THEM.

10:45.045 --> 10:46.747
OH. HI. (chuckles)

10:48.248 --> 10:50.080
HOW DOES
THAT WEDDING RING FEEL?

10:50.080 --> 10:51.121
LIKE HANDCUFFS.

10:54.284 --> 10:55.826
(dishes clink)

10:55.826 --> 10:57.157
THANK YOU.

10:57.157 --> 10:59.129
OH. SORRY. (grunts)

11:01.391 --> 11:02.733
WHAT'S WRONG, CHICK?

11:02.733 --> 11:05.435
I KEEP PRACTICING
FOR JUNE BUG'S CEREMONY,

11:05.435 --> 11:07.838
AND I CAN'T GET
TWO SENTENCES DEEP

11:07.838 --> 11:10.170
WITHOUT SQUIRTING OUT
TEARS.

11:10.170 --> 11:11.942
CAN YOU FELLAS HELP?

11:11.942 --> 11:13.043
FAT CHANCE.

11:13.043 --> 11:15.105
THANK YOU, SON.

11:15.105 --> 11:17.077
(sighs)

11:17.077 --> 11:18.208
WHAT JUST HAPPENED?

11:18.208 --> 11:21.411
AH. WE ALL GOT BEER GUYS.

11:21.411 --> 11:24.414
GET IN THE GAME, MAN.
OKAY, CHICK.

11:24.414 --> 11:27.257
WE JUST NEED TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT'LL KEEP YOU FROM CRYING.

11:27.257 --> 11:29.720
WELL, I'D NEVER CRY
IN FRONT OF MY HORSE.

11:29.720 --> 11:31.421
ONCE YOU DO THAT,
THEY OWN YOU.

11:31.421 --> 11:33.263
YOU KNOW HOW I KEEP
FROM CRYING?

11:33.263 --> 11:36.066
I HAVE TWO LITTLE SECRETS--
MY NUTS.

11:36.066 --> 11:37.167
PEACE OUT, SIR.

11:37.167 --> 11:39.099
(exhales deeply)

11:39.099 --> 11:41.401
LOOK, IF YOU LOCK
ON ANOTHER MAN'S EYES,

11:41.401 --> 11:43.333
THERE'S NO WAY
YOU'RE GONNA CRY.

11:43.333 --> 11:44.875
WATCH.

11:44.875 --> 11:49.139
LOVE IS THE MOST POWERFUL THING
IN THE UNIVERSE.

11:49.139 --> 11:52.943
(voice breaking) LOVE IS WHAT
BRINGS TWO PEOPLE TOGETHER.

11:52.943 --> 11:54.244
ANDY, YOU TRY.

11:54.244 --> 11:56.817
(voice breaks)
I KNOW I CAN'T DO IT.

11:56.817 --> 11:59.049
TOM, PLEASE SAY
YOU'RE ON THE PLANE.

11:59.049 --> 12:00.190
SORRY, JULES.

12:00.190 --> 12:02.152
THEY WON'T LET ME FLY
WITH A BABY THAT'S NOT MINE.

12:02.152 --> 12:03.153
LET'S SEE. BEND OVER.

12:03.153 --> 12:04.494
OH. ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT. THERE.

12:04.494 --> 12:05.495
THERE YOU GO. HOLD ON.

12:05.495 --> 12:07.027
STAND UP. STAND UP.
ALL RIGHT.

12:07.027 --> 12:08.028
(imitates siren whoops)

12:08.028 --> 12:10.360
CLEAVAGE ALERT! (laughs)

12:10.360 --> 12:12.302
STOP STARING.
THESE AREN'T FOR YOU.

12:12.302 --> 12:13.503
I NEED THE CONCIERGE
TO BREAK SOME LAWS

12:13.503 --> 12:15.205
TO GET GRAYSON'S KID HERE,

12:15.205 --> 12:18.038
AND SINCE HE'S OBVIOUSLY GOT
A THING FOR YOUR WIFE...

12:18.038 --> 12:21.141
(chuckles) I'M GONNA USE ELLIE
TO CLOSE THE DEAL.

12:21.141 --> 12:22.873
I LIKE THIS LIPSTICK COLOR,
BUT... (sighs)

12:22.873 --> 12:24.174
DO YOU THINK
IT'S WET ENOUGH FOR HIM?

12:24.174 --> 12:26.016
MM. LICK YOUR LIPS.
HUH? HUH?

12:26.016 --> 12:27.017
UH-HUH.

12:27.017 --> 12:28.979
I'M NOT COMFORTABLE
WITH THIS.

12:28.979 --> 12:31.421
DO YOU THINK I WANT
TO GO DO THIS WITH DANIEL?

12:31.421 --> 12:33.183
HIS NAME IS DANIEL.
(gasps)

12:33.183 --> 12:34.184
(whispers) I LOVE THAT NAME.

12:34.184 --> 12:35.856
(chuckles)
OH. "DANIEL." REALLY?

12:35.856 --> 12:40.330
DAMN IT, ANDY, I NEED THIS,
SO IF ELLIE HAS TO GET DOLLED UP

12:40.330 --> 12:43.493
OR FLIRT OR MAKE OUT A LITTLE,
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?

12:43.493 --> 12:45.165
MAKE OUT?
WE DON'T MAKE OUT!

12:45.165 --> 12:47.838
FEELS LIKE YOU DON'T WANT
JULES TO BE HAPPY.

12:47.838 --> 12:49.099
THAT'S NOT COOL, MAN.

12:49.099 --> 12:51.471
(whispers) NOT COOL.

12:51.471 --> 12:54.905
YOU'RE NOT WEARING UNDERWEAR!
COME ON!
(door opens and closes)

12:56.006 --> 12:58.448
SO YOU WANT ME
TO KIDNAP A BABY?

12:58.448 --> 12:59.910
YES.
NO.

12:59.910 --> 13:01.311
NO.

13:01.311 --> 13:04.084
WHAT WE WANT YOU TO DO IS
TO SNEAK A BABY...

13:04.084 --> 13:05.115
(lowered voice)
THAT ISN'T MINE...

13:05.115 --> 13:06.456
(chuckles, normal voice)
ONTO A PLANE.

13:06.456 --> 13:09.459
IT'S--IT'S MORE LIKE
KID BORROWING. (chuckles)

13:09.459 --> 13:12.963
WELL, I COULD GET MY HANDS
ON A REALLY GREAT LOCAL BABY.

13:12.963 --> 13:14.564
(whispers) OH.
NO.

13:14.564 --> 13:17.197
IMPORTED BABY IT IS.
I'M ON IT.

13:17.197 --> 13:21.371
LISTEN, DANIEL,
YOU GET US WHAT WE NEED,

13:21.371 --> 13:25.375
AND WE WILL GET YOU
EXACTLY WHAT YOU NEED.

13:25.375 --> 13:26.476
OKAY. (sighs)

13:26.476 --> 13:27.537
(whispers) STOP IT.

13:27.537 --> 13:29.379
(lowered voice)
I DON'T WANT TO STOP IT.

13:29.379 --> 13:32.042
TOMMY... (lowered voice)
I NEED ANOTHER ONE.

13:33.113 --> 13:35.315
I'M SORRY, LADIES.
I TRIED.

13:35.315 --> 13:37.247
WRITE TO ME.

13:37.247 --> 13:40.420
GRAYSON, I'M SO SORRY.

13:40.420 --> 13:43.553
I-I CAN'T GET TAMPA JILL
HERE FOR THE WEDDING.

13:43.553 --> 13:47.327
THANKS FOR TRYING. (sighs)

13:47.327 --> 13:51.361
OH. WOW. WADE'S HERE.
(gasps) IS THE WAR OVER?

13:51.361 --> 13:52.362
NO, SWEETIE.

13:52.362 --> 13:53.503
NO, I PULLED SOME STRINGS.

13:53.503 --> 13:55.305
I, UH, KNEW YOUR WEDDING
WOULDN'T BE AS SPECIAL

13:55.305 --> 13:57.968
FOR LAURIE UNLESS I WAS HERE
TO SHARE IT WITH HER.

13:57.968 --> 13:59.910
THAT IS SO SWEET.

13:59.910 --> 14:01.071
(mouths word)

14:01.071 --> 14:03.243
(sighs) I CAN'T DO THIS.

14:03.243 --> 14:04.614
WHAT?
WE HAVE A WEDDING PLANNED

14:04.614 --> 14:06.446
IN A FEW MONTHS.

14:06.446 --> 14:08.278
YOUR DAUGHTER COULD
BE THERE.

14:09.549 --> 14:10.921
GUYS.

14:12.052 --> 14:13.083
THE WEDDING'S OFF.

14:13.083 --> 14:14.084
(Laurie and Andy) WHAT?

14:14.084 --> 14:15.926
GOOD. I NEVER LIKED HIM.

14:15.926 --> 14:18.128
STILL MARRYING HIM, DAD.
JUST A LITTLE BIT LATER.

14:18.128 --> 14:20.390
LAURIE!

14:20.390 --> 14:23.433
(slurred voice)
YOU SAID YOU WANTED NAKED!

14:23.433 --> 14:24.995
(Bobby, Wade, Andy
and Chick laugh)

14:24.995 --> 14:26.196
(Ellie) HEY. HEY, HEY!

14:26.196 --> 14:29.339
HARVEY KEITEL. OVER HERE.
THAT'S RIGHT.

14:29.339 --> 14:34.604
(camera shutter clicks)
LAURIE... (sighs)
I'M SO... CRAZY ABOUT YOU,

14:34.604 --> 14:40.150
BUT YOU JUST KEEP IGNORING IT
LIKE IT'S NOT REAL.

14:41.211 --> 14:42.512
MOM, GUESS WHAT?

14:42.512 --> 14:45.455
(lowered voice) I LIKE WINE NOW.
(high-pitched voice) HAPPY?

14:45.455 --> 14:47.157
MIXED FEELINGS.

14:53.663 --> 14:55.395
I KNOW POSTPONING THE WEDDING
HAS BEEN TOUGH ON YOU,

14:55.395 --> 14:57.397
BUT THANKS FOR
LOOKING OUT FOR ME.

14:57.397 --> 14:58.398
ALWAYS.

14:58.398 --> 15:00.900
MWAH.

15:00.900 --> 15:04.274
MAN, I WISH I HAD A FIANCEE.

15:04.274 --> 15:06.977
SEE YA, G-SPOT!

15:06.977 --> 15:10.210
SO, J-BIRD,
HOW ARE YOU HOLDING UP

15:10.210 --> 15:12.582
WITH LAST NIGHT'S
NON-NUPTIALS?

15:12.582 --> 15:14.084
I GUESS
I AM A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED

15:14.084 --> 15:16.286
BECAUSE LAST NIGHT WAS
SUPPOSED TO BE MY HONEYMOON,

15:16.286 --> 15:20.490
BUT INSTEAD WE SPENT THE NIGHT
TAKING CARE OF THIS DUMMY.

15:20.490 --> 15:22.622
OH, I CAN'T BELIEVE
OUR BOY IS 21.
(sighs)

15:22.622 --> 15:23.693
(whispers) I KNOW.

15:23.693 --> 15:26.596
(normal voice)
HE DOES LOOK SO OLD NOW,

15:26.596 --> 15:29.499
BUT IT MIGHT JUST BE
THAT MUSTACHE I DREW ON HIM.

15:29.499 --> 15:33.633
(laughs) THAT IS CLASSIC.
WE GOTTA GET TO THE AIRPORT.

15:33.633 --> 15:37.137
(snoring)

15:37.137 --> 15:38.708
(grunts)

15:40.070 --> 15:41.371
(sniffles)

15:41.371 --> 15:43.513
(groggy voice)
HOW DID I GET HERE?

15:43.513 --> 15:44.944
MOSTLY LUGGAGE CARTS.

15:44.944 --> 15:47.017
(chuckles)
THIS IS THE BEST PART.

15:47.017 --> 15:49.049
THIS IS WHEN HE REMEMBERS
WHAT HE DID.

15:49.049 --> 15:51.621
OHH! NO.

15:51.621 --> 15:53.483
YAY!

15:53.483 --> 15:56.326
THIS IS SO EMBARRASSING.

15:56.326 --> 15:59.329
I'M GONNA HAVE TO HIDE
FROM LAURIE FOREVER.

15:59.329 --> 16:01.491
(Bobby)
NO, IT'S OKAY, T-MAN.
(sighs)

16:01.491 --> 16:02.732
EVERY GREAT LOVE STORY
STARTS OUT

16:02.732 --> 16:05.495
WITH A MAN EMBARRASSING THE CRAP
OUT OF HIMSELF.

16:05.495 --> 16:08.468
YOUR FATHER'S CORRECT.
RIGHT, BABE?

16:08.468 --> 16:10.700
SORRY.
I WAS TEXTING DANIEL.

16:10.700 --> 16:13.703
JULES, HONESTLY,
IS THIS CHEATING?

16:13.703 --> 16:15.005
(whispers) LET ME SEE.
(laughs)
(laughs)

16:15.005 --> 16:16.606
(normal voice) WOW. YES.

16:16.606 --> 16:17.677
(laughs)

16:17.677 --> 16:19.279
THIS IS NOT OKAY.

16:19.279 --> 16:22.512
TRAV,
THESE BIG, MORTIFYING MOMENTS...
(mouths words)

16:22.512 --> 16:25.055
THEY MAKE AN IMPRESSION.
TRUST ME, OKAY?

16:25.055 --> 16:26.756
YOU'RE GONNA FIND
YOURSELF SOMEPLACE,

16:26.756 --> 16:29.089
AND SHE WON'T BE ABLE
TO STOP LOOKING AT YOU.

16:29.089 --> 16:32.062
JULES DID IT TO ME.
REMEMBER WHEN, UM, WE FIRST MET

16:32.062 --> 16:34.024
AND YOU FLASHED THAT PAPERBOY

16:34.024 --> 16:36.666
AND THEN HE CRASHED HIS BIKE
INTO THIS CAR? (chuckles)

16:36.666 --> 16:41.631
AFTER THAT, I COULD NOT STOP
THINKING ABOUT HER.

16:41.631 --> 16:42.732
(crying)

16:42.732 --> 16:45.675
NO. YOU'RE COOPERING.
WHY IS SHE COOPERING?

16:45.675 --> 16:46.776
(voice breaking)
WHY DOES TALKING ABOUT US

16:46.776 --> 16:49.509
FALLING IN LOVE MAKE ME
SO SAD?

16:49.509 --> 16:51.481
(clicks tongue) AW.
COME HERE.

16:51.481 --> 16:53.283
(sniffles)

16:53.283 --> 16:55.345
WELL, BEFORE NAPA,

16:55.345 --> 16:57.787
I WAS REALLY EXCITED
ABOUT OUR BIG WEDDING.

16:57.787 --> 17:01.221
I HAD INVITED EVERYONE I KNOW,
EVEN MY POOL GUY...

17:01.221 --> 17:03.153
ERNIE?
I HAVE NO IDEA.

17:03.153 --> 17:04.424
BUT THEN WE DECIDED
TO ELOPE,

17:04.424 --> 17:06.596
AND I-I FELT LIKE
I WAS HAVING A STROKE,

17:06.596 --> 17:08.728
YOU KNOW,
ONE OF THOSE HAPPY STROKES.

17:08.728 --> 17:10.600
THERE ARE NO SUCH THING
AS HAPPY STROKES.

17:10.600 --> 17:12.062
WELL, THEN WHAT DID
KIRK DOUGLAS HAVE?

17:12.062 --> 17:13.133
A STROKE.

17:13.133 --> 17:15.335
ANYWAY, I'M NOT EVEN
LOOKING FORWARD

17:15.335 --> 17:17.337
TO THE BIG WEDDING ANYMORE.
(sighs)

17:17.337 --> 17:18.568
THIS BIG WEDDING,

17:18.568 --> 17:20.570
THE--THE ONE THAT
THE POOL GUY IS GOING TO--

17:20.570 --> 17:22.812
AM I INVITED?

17:22.812 --> 17:24.744
THAT'S AWKWARD. (chuckles)
VERY, VERY AWKWARD.

17:24.744 --> 17:26.176
I'M SORRY. I'M--
I'M JUST A LITTLE EDGY.

17:26.176 --> 17:28.178
I WAS UP ALL NIGHT...
(sighs) WATCHING VIDEOS

17:28.178 --> 17:32.352
THAT MY DEAD HUSBAND MADE
OF HIS FORMER LOVERS.

17:32.352 --> 17:34.724
HERE'S SOMETHING FUN.

17:34.724 --> 17:37.457
THERE WERE A FEW DUDES
IN THERE. (chuckles)

17:37.457 --> 17:38.588
THAT'S A TOUGH ONE. YEAH.
THAT'S ROUGH.

17:38.588 --> 17:40.130
(chuckles) WOW.
WHEW. (chuckles)

17:40.130 --> 17:41.661
LOOK, I THINK THE REASON WHY
YOU GUYS WERE SO EXCITED

17:41.661 --> 17:43.693
ABOUT ELOPING IS THAT
BOTH OF YOU HAVE A TENDENCY

17:43.693 --> 17:46.366
TO SORT OF BE
SET IN YOUR WAYS.

17:46.366 --> 17:48.138
I THINK THAT'S WHY
IT'S IMPORTANT

17:48.138 --> 17:50.200
THAT YOU GUYS ARE
SPONTANEOUS, YOU KNOW?

17:50.200 --> 17:52.402
THAT'LL ADD EXCITEMENT
TO YOUR LIFE.

17:52.402 --> 17:57.447
IF YOU DO THAT, I PROMISE,
THIS MARRIAGE CAN WORK.

17:57.447 --> 17:59.809
(paper rips)

18:01.511 --> 18:03.853
A HANDWRITTEN
WEDDING INVITATION?

18:03.853 --> 18:06.456
(gasps) I WOULD LOVE TO.
(chuckles)

18:06.456 --> 18:09.189
(Katie Herzig's "Lost And Found"
playing)

18:09.189 --> 18:11.761
DO YOU PROMISE TO DO
WHAT LYNN SAID--

18:11.761 --> 18:14.464
TO ALWAYS BE SPONTANEOUS?

18:14.464 --> 18:15.625
OF COURSE.

18:15.625 --> 18:17.767
IT'S SO PRETTY HERE.

18:17.767 --> 18:22.232
IT SUCKS THAT THIS STUPID TOWN
WON'T ALLOW BEACH WEDDINGS.

18:22.232 --> 18:23.833
YOU SURE YOU STILL WANT
TO DO THIS?

18:23.833 --> 18:25.635
HELL, YEAH.

18:25.635 --> 18:27.377
ALL CLEAR.

18:27.377 --> 18:28.878
(lowered voice)
GO, GO, GO, GO, GO!

18:28.878 --> 18:31.481
в™Є BUT I CAN'T FIND THE WORDS
I WANT в™Є

18:31.481 --> 18:33.413
в™Є OH, I CAN'T в™Є

18:33.413 --> 18:34.814
DAD, IT'S TIME!

18:34.814 --> 18:36.816
в™Є I WANT в™Є

18:39.889 --> 18:41.321
(blusters)

18:41.321 --> 18:43.323
(chuckles)

18:43.323 --> 18:45.295
в™Є IF YOU ARE GONE
IN ANOTHER LIFE в™Є

18:45.295 --> 18:46.896
THAT'S IT, BABY.
YOU WAIT RIGHT THERE.

18:46.896 --> 18:49.128
HIT IT, DAD.

18:49.128 --> 18:51.831
TO ME, LOVE IS
THE MOST POWERFUL THING

18:51.831 --> 18:53.833
IN THE UNIVERSE.

18:53.833 --> 18:57.167
LOVE IS WHAT BRINGS
TWO PEOPLE TOGETHER.

18:57.167 --> 18:59.839
в™Є OH, I'M AFRAID в™Є

18:59.839 --> 19:01.541
(mouths words)

19:01.541 --> 19:03.413
(mouths words)

19:04.574 --> 19:05.575
в™Є AH, AH, AH в™Є

19:05.575 --> 19:08.748
в™Є SOMEBODY FOUND ME HERE в™Є

19:08.748 --> 19:09.819
в™Є AH, AH, AH в™Є

19:09.819 --> 19:11.281
LIFE IS NOT WORTH LIVING

19:11.281 --> 19:13.823
UNLESS YOU FIND SOMEONE
TO SHARE IT WITH.

19:13.823 --> 19:15.825
COPS! ABOUT 100 YARDS BACK.

19:15.825 --> 19:18.858
OKAY. YOU ALL KNOW THE DRILL.

19:18.858 --> 19:20.390
LET'S TAKE THIS ON THE MOVE.

19:20.390 --> 19:24.264
в™Є IF YOU'RE GONNA CRY
MY TEARS в™Є

19:24.264 --> 19:26.165
UH, CAN WE GET
THE RINGS, PLEASE?

19:26.165 --> 19:27.166
STAN!

19:27.166 --> 19:28.698
(screaming)

19:28.698 --> 19:29.699
(Jules chuckles)

19:29.699 --> 19:31.541
AAH! (chuckles)

19:31.541 --> 19:33.673
BACK TO THE NANNY, STAN!

19:33.673 --> 19:36.576
DO YOU, GRAYSON, TAKE
MY DAUGHTER JULES

19:36.576 --> 19:38.748
TO BE YOUR WIFE
AND TO TAKE CARE OF

19:38.748 --> 19:40.910
OR I'LL KICK YOUR ASS?

19:40.910 --> 19:42.382
I DO.

19:42.382 --> 19:44.854
в™Є LOST AND FOUND в™Є

19:44.854 --> 19:49.859
JUNE BUG, YOU'VE NEVER
LOOKED MORE BEAUTIFUL.

19:49.859 --> 19:52.892
YOU REALLY WANT THIS FELLA TO BE
YOUR HUSBAND, DON'T YA?

19:52.892 --> 19:54.864
I REALLY DO, DAD.

19:54.864 --> 19:59.729
в™Є OH, OH, OH в™Є

19:59.729 --> 20:00.900
(sighs)

20:00.900 --> 20:02.232
USE YOUR HORSE, CHICK.

20:02.232 --> 20:03.733
в™Є OH, OH, AH, AH, AH в™Є

20:03.733 --> 20:05.735
(nickers)
в™Є SOMEBODY FOUND ME HERE в™Є

20:05.735 --> 20:09.239
THEN I NOW PRONOUNCE YOU
MAN AND WIFE.

20:09.239 --> 20:11.581
NOW LET'S ALL JUST
STOP WALKING...

20:11.581 --> 20:13.313
в™Є SOMEBODY SAVED ME в™Є

20:13.313 --> 20:17.216
AND WATCH THIS YOUNG MAN
KISS HIS BRIDE.

20:19.218 --> 20:23.222
в™Є IF YOU'RE GONNA CRY
MY TEARS в™Є

20:23.222 --> 20:27.226
в™Є IF YOU'RE GONNA HOLD
MY BREATH в™Є

20:27.226 --> 20:30.229
в™Є IF YOU'RE GONNA LET ME SEE в™Є

20:30.229 --> 20:32.362
в™Є THE SUN YOU SET в™Є

20:32.362 --> 20:33.833
(sighs)

20:33.833 --> 20:35.405
ALL RIGHT. WHAT THE HELL'S
GOING ON HERE?

20:35.405 --> 20:36.406
YOU GUYS, GO! GO!
OH.

20:36.406 --> 20:38.438
COME ON.

20:38.438 --> 20:40.740
GUYS? UH, A LITTLE HELP?

20:40.740 --> 20:42.542
(indistinct conversations)

20:42.542 --> 20:45.915
в™Є OH, I AM LOST AND FOUND в™Є
(horse whinnies)

20:45.915 --> 20:47.977
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.

20:47.977 --> 20:50.680
I LOVE YOU, TOO,
BUT HOLD ON.

20:50.680 --> 20:52.021
I'M NOT GREAT AT DRIVING
THESE THINGS.

20:52.021 --> 20:53.022
(whispers) OH.

21:04.394 --> 21:07.337
(grunts)
WHAT ARE YOU DOING, HON?

21:07.337 --> 21:09.499
DANIEL'S HAVING TROUBLE
SLEEPING.

21:09.499 --> 21:11.401
WILL YOU TAKE A QUICK PIC?

21:11.401 --> 21:13.343
THIS IS SERIOUSLY NOT OKAY.

21:13.343 --> 21:14.604
ANDY, THE MAN CAN'T SLEEP.

21:14.604 --> 21:17.276
HE'S GOT A PAROLE HEARING
AT 6:00.

21:21.651 --> 21:23.353
(camera shutter clicks, beep)

21:23.353 --> 21:25.955
WELL, WOULD YOU
AT LEAST C.C. ME ON THAT?

21:25.955 --> 21:28.758
MAYBE. I'LL ASK DANIEL
IF IT'S OKAY.
