WEBVTT

00:00.130 --> 00:01.403
Good morning, Boyle.

00:01.404 --> 00:05.370
It's Halloween... I'm surprised
you didn't put on a costume.

00:05.371 --> 00:07.338
I was going to, sir,
but then I decided,

00:07.339 --> 00:08.873
"screw that jazz."

00:08.874 --> 00:11.142
Well, I'm the only one
who ever dresses up,

00:11.143 --> 00:12.777
no one ever gets my costume,

00:12.778 --> 00:14.679
and they make fun of me...
so I'm done.

00:14.714 --> 00:17.382
These people don't deserve
my dress-up gifts.

00:17.383 --> 00:18.483
[elevator dings]

00:18.484 --> 00:20.785
<i>Charles, seriously?</i>

00:20.820 --> 00:21.820
No costume?

00:21.821 --> 00:22.921
What the hell, Charles?

00:22.922 --> 00:24.189
Where's your Halloween spirit?

00:24.223 --> 00:26.591
But you guys always
make fun of me.

00:26.592 --> 00:30.195
I have never once
insulted you in my life,

00:30.196 --> 00:32.497
especially vis-à-vis
your appearance.

00:32.497 --> 00:34.265
Yeah, man, we always
love your costumes.

00:34.300 --> 00:36.468
Remember last year,
when you came as that

00:36.469 --> 00:38.903
person and/or thing?

00:38.904 --> 00:40.238
Yes, I do remember!

00:40.272 --> 00:43.375
Sir, permission to sprint
to my car and get

00:43.376 --> 00:44.476
my emergency costume?

00:44.477 --> 00:45.677
Does it matter if I say no?

00:45.711 --> 00:47.345
No!

00:52.952 --> 00:54.619
A-bam, bam, boom.

00:56.288 --> 00:57.455
What the... what...

00:57.456 --> 00:59.257
Why are you dressed up?
You look like an idiot.

00:59.291 --> 01:00.325
But... but...

01:00.326 --> 01:01.726
Yeah, what are you
supposed to be,

01:01.727 --> 01:03.228
a sassy car mechanic?

01:03.229 --> 01:06.564
No, come on... he's clearly
the rejected Pop-Tarts mascot,

01:06.565 --> 01:07.699
Harry Pop-Tart.

01:07.700 --> 01:09.534
I am not!
You know who I am!

01:09.568 --> 01:11.369
Squad, that's enough...
you're making Boyle

01:11.370 --> 01:12.370
feel bad on purpose.

01:12.371 --> 01:13.671
- He's Elvis.
- Yes!

01:13.672 --> 01:15.440
Elvis Stojko,
the Canadian figure skater.

01:15.441 --> 01:16.507
No!

01:36.529 --> 01:38.863
Attention, squad:
today is the most

01:38.864 --> 01:40.865
important day in
the history of this precinct.

01:40.900 --> 01:44.803
For today is Halloween...

01:44.804 --> 01:46.471
I thought we were going to
say it together.

01:46.472 --> 01:47.939
- I never agreed to that.
- All right.

01:47.940 --> 01:49.507
As you may know,
for the past two years,

01:49.508 --> 01:52.544
Captain Holt and I have engaged
in an epic battle of wits.

01:52.578 --> 01:55.213
The goal: to determine
who must call the other

01:55.214 --> 01:57.282
an amazing detective/genius.

01:57.283 --> 01:59.918
The first year,
by sheer, dumb luck,

01:59.919 --> 02:01.720
Jake eked out a feeble victory.

02:01.721 --> 02:03.288
And last year, I let
the captain win,

02:03.289 --> 02:04.956
because he's old an sad.

02:04.957 --> 02:06.858
Sad because the competition
was so dismal.

02:06.859 --> 02:08.258
Is this meaning
about something?

02:08.259 --> 02:09.627
It's about everything.

02:09.627 --> 02:10.829
<i>This year's the tie-breaker,</i>

02:10.830 --> 02:12.697
a final heist to decide
once and for all

02:12.698 --> 02:14.833
the true king of the nine-nine.

02:14.834 --> 02:17.635
Halloween Heist III:
The Heistening. Tagline?

02:17.636 --> 02:19.637
This year we both attempt
to steal the same object

02:19.638 --> 02:21.539
instead of Jake attempting
to steal one from me.

02:21.540 --> 02:24.175
I gave you one direction
on the tagline... snappy.

02:24.176 --> 02:27.078
But yes, we will be attempting
to steal the same item...

02:27.079 --> 02:28.480
this.

02:28.514 --> 02:30.281
<i>The crown will be locked
in this briefcase,</i>

02:30.282 --> 02:33.118
which in turn will be locked
in the interrogation room.

02:33.119 --> 02:37.722
<i>♪ And so unto the briefcase
goes the crown ♪</i>

02:37.723 --> 02:39.357
Didn't sing it with me.

02:39.358 --> 02:40.525
<i>We will need help,</i>

02:40.526 --> 02:41.960
so to be fair,
we're holding a draft.

02:41.961 --> 02:43.728
The captain and I have
given up our overtime,

02:43.729 --> 02:46.231
so everyone who participates
will get the night off... captain?

02:46.232 --> 02:48.366
With the first pick
of the draft, I choose...

02:48.367 --> 02:49.901
Terry.

02:49.902 --> 02:52.604
Okay, brawns over brains.

02:52.605 --> 02:53.938
All right, I take Charles.

02:53.939 --> 02:55.440
I get it. Close friend.

02:55.441 --> 02:56.641
- I pick Gina.
- Gina?

02:56.642 --> 02:57.909
I take Rosa.

02:57.910 --> 02:58.910
What?

02:58.911 --> 03:01.379
Okay, all right.
Well, Captain...

03:01.380 --> 03:03.081
that leaves me with you.

03:03.082 --> 03:04.816
- Let's do this.
- Hang on, Santiago.

03:04.817 --> 03:06.284
I'm not sure I can trust you.

03:06.285 --> 03:10.755
You're Peralta's paramour;
maybe you should be on his team.

03:10.756 --> 03:12.524
No, no, no...
Amy would do anything

03:12.525 --> 03:14.959
to win your approval,
including pretending

03:14.960 --> 03:16.995
to be in a relationship with me
for the past few weeks

03:16.996 --> 03:18.797
only to betray me now.

03:18.798 --> 03:20.732
Jake, you are majorly
overthinking this.

03:20.733 --> 03:23.201
Maybe, but it's a risk
I'm not willing to take.

03:23.202 --> 03:26.571
- You're not on my team, Amy.
- Yeah, Amy's out.

03:26.572 --> 03:28.907
By midnight,
whoever has the crown

03:28.908 --> 03:32.043
will be the king
of the nine-nine.

03:32.044 --> 03:34.212
Uh, Hitchcock and I still
haven't been chosen.

03:34.213 --> 03:35.714
- I'm good.
- Me too.

03:37.650 --> 03:42.354
So, I see you've been assigned
to guard the briefcase too.

03:42.355 --> 03:46.524
Yup, I'm not supposed to let
it or you out of my sight,

03:46.525 --> 03:48.360
if that even is you.

03:48.394 --> 03:50.895
Ow, that's my face!

03:50.896 --> 03:53.398
Oh, sorry... I thought it
was a cheap, rubber mask.

03:53.399 --> 03:55.767
Well, I have exciting news.

03:55.768 --> 03:57.902
I found the perfect guy
to set you up with.

03:57.937 --> 04:02.240
After zero consideration,
I'm happy to say, "hard pass."

04:02.274 --> 04:04.442
Come on, our parents
are married.

04:04.443 --> 04:05.910
Genevieve and I are dating.

04:05.911 --> 04:07.746
I want you to have someone too.

04:07.747 --> 04:09.547
- [sighs]
- You shouldn't have to

04:09.548 --> 04:11.116
slow-dance alone
after family dinner.

04:11.117 --> 04:13.018
How did my life come to this?

04:13.019 --> 04:15.387
Charles, it's very sweet
that you want to

04:15.388 --> 04:17.055
set me up with someone,

04:17.055 --> 04:19.757
but I do not trust your taste
in guys at all.

04:19.759 --> 04:21.726
I have spectacular taste in men.

04:21.726 --> 04:23.428
You would love Nadia.

04:23.429 --> 04:24.596
His name is Nadia?

04:24.597 --> 04:27.265
Oh, all of a sudden
Nadia's not a cool name?

04:27.300 --> 04:29.701
You are impossible.

04:29.735 --> 04:32.170
- Here, got it?
- Got it.

04:36.509 --> 04:38.243
Hey, Jake.
Can we talk?

04:38.277 --> 04:39.711
Yeah.

04:39.712 --> 04:41.946
You really hurt my feelings
by leaving me off your team.

04:41.947 --> 04:44.487
Oh, I had no idea
you felt that way.

04:44.517 --> 04:47.152
Well, it doesn't feel great
to be left out.

04:47.153 --> 04:49.421
Right, totally, I get it.
I'm sorry...

04:49.422 --> 04:50.522
Captain Holt!

04:50.556 --> 04:52.724
What? Why are you yelling
at my boobs?

04:52.725 --> 04:54.359
Because that's where
the camera is.

04:54.360 --> 04:55.894
Nice try, Ray-Ray!

04:55.895 --> 04:57.295
There's no camera, Jake.

04:57.296 --> 04:58.496
I was being serious.

04:58.531 --> 05:01.299
Okay fine... if you're
telling the truth,

05:01.300 --> 05:02.767
then I sincerely apologize.

05:02.768 --> 05:06.571
But since you're not,
I will defeat you!

05:09.342 --> 05:12.143
[witch cackling]
Ahhh! Gah! Scary witch!

05:12.144 --> 05:13.144
Scary, so scary!

05:13.145 --> 05:14.379
Amy, don't feel bad.

05:14.380 --> 05:16.281
You can get in on
my bet with Scully.

05:16.282 --> 05:17.949
At midnight tonight,
we will steal

05:17.950 --> 05:19.684
his foot fungus cream.

05:19.685 --> 05:22.153
Thanks, that's very kind
of you to include me,

05:22.154 --> 05:23.388
but I'll have to pass.

05:23.389 --> 05:24.823
The mind games have
already begun.

05:24.824 --> 05:27.258
- No, I'm not part of this.
- Oh, of course not.

05:27.259 --> 05:29.594
Neither am I.
Wink.

05:29.595 --> 05:30.762
Ugh.

05:30.763 --> 05:33.231
I'm not going to meet
my next boyfriend

05:33.232 --> 05:34.499
through a Charles set-up.

05:34.533 --> 05:37.435
I'm going to meet him in
an illegal dance competition

05:37.436 --> 05:39.437
in an abandoned subway tunnel.

05:40.640 --> 05:42.007
It's go time, Boyle.

05:42.008 --> 05:44.376
Holt and Terry have closed
the blinds... release the roaches.

05:44.410 --> 05:47.445
Alternately, he could win
an illegal street race

05:47.446 --> 05:49.481
in which my love is the prize.

05:49.482 --> 05:51.650
Oh, my God! Gina, look!
Roaches!

05:51.651 --> 05:53.151
- [screams]
- Look!

05:53.152 --> 05:56.655
Ew, Charles, kill them with
whatever cologne you're wearing!

05:56.656 --> 05:58.223
No, I can't!
They're moving too fast!

05:58.224 --> 06:00.592
I can't kill them!
It's pandemonium!

06:00.593 --> 06:03.561
If I die, turn my Tweets
into a book!

06:03.562 --> 06:06.398
Commence operation,
"Oh crap, wrong vent."

06:06.432 --> 06:10.068
- [gasp]
- Oh crap, wrong vent.

06:10.069 --> 06:11.369
This was a mistake.

06:11.370 --> 06:13.371
Nice try, losers.
You blew it.

06:13.372 --> 06:14.639
Yeah, we totally blew it.

06:14.640 --> 06:16.708
And all because Boyle
marked the wrong vent.

06:18.144 --> 06:20.178
<i>It's not my fault... I thought
it was the right vent.</i>

06:20.179 --> 06:22.714
- Unbelievable, mister.
- You are, mister.

06:22.748 --> 06:25.417
I'm having trouble even
believing you at all right now.

06:25.418 --> 06:27.919
<i>That is the last time
I let Charles mark a vent.</i>

06:27.954 --> 06:29.721
<i>I'm normally great
at marking vents.</i>

06:29.722 --> 06:31.222
Lock picked.

06:31.223 --> 06:34.931
<i>Never, ever, never, ever,
ever, never, ever, ever,</i>

06:34.961 --> 06:38.463
never, ever, will I ever,
never, ever, ever, ever,

06:38.464 --> 06:40.966
ever, never, never, never...
I forgive you, and good-bye.

06:44.303 --> 06:46.204
Wow, you should have
seen us, Rosa.

06:46.205 --> 06:47.505
Charles and I were amazing.

06:47.540 --> 06:49.174
I somersaulted through a window,

06:49.175 --> 06:50.709
cut the crown out of
a briefcase,

06:50.710 --> 06:52.944
and replaced everything
in under a minute.

06:52.945 --> 06:54.412
Yeah, I guess you
helped a little.

06:54.413 --> 06:57.349
But our fake argument
was super convincing.

06:57.350 --> 06:59.250
And all of a sudden,
we had to make it longer,

06:59.251 --> 07:01.052
and we did.

07:01.053 --> 07:03.421
Anyways, now all we gotta do
is guard this drawer

07:03.422 --> 07:05.624
until midnight,
and the best part about it is

07:05.625 --> 07:09.094
Captain Holt has
absolutely no idea.

07:09.095 --> 07:11.730
He is such a fool.

07:11.731 --> 07:14.666
Yes, I'm the fool.

07:14.667 --> 07:16.635
You fool.

07:16.669 --> 07:18.103
So we wanted Jake
to take the crown?

07:18.104 --> 07:20.572
Sergeant, are you familiar
with the Hungarian fencing term,

07:20.573 --> 07:22.240
<i>Hosszú Gorcs?</i>

07:22.241 --> 07:23.575
You must realize
my answer is no.

07:23.576 --> 07:25.243
It's a strategy of
letting your opponent

07:25.244 --> 07:28.179
win points early to give them
a sense of overconfidence,

07:28.180 --> 07:32.083
thus exposing a much easier
target for you later.

07:32.084 --> 07:33.652
You think he's
overconfident enough?

07:35.888 --> 07:37.789
<i>I'm the smartest man alive.</i>

07:37.790 --> 07:39.291
<i>I'm never gonna die.</i>

07:42.080 --> 07:43.547
- [knocks on door]
- Sir, do you have a minute?

07:43.548 --> 07:44.715
Of course.

07:44.716 --> 07:46.384
Jeffords,
we'll rendezvous later.

07:52.958 --> 07:55.092
Sir, I want to talk about Jake.

07:55.093 --> 07:57.295
- Okay...
- Amy! Help!

07:57.296 --> 07:59.563
Our foot fungus heist
has gone sideways!

07:59.564 --> 08:01.098
Hitchcock, not now.

08:01.099 --> 08:02.500
Scully doesn't know I'm in here.

08:02.501 --> 08:04.235
I stole his foot cream,
but then I lost it.

08:04.236 --> 08:06.837
Amy, you're the only hope
I have of finding it.

08:06.838 --> 08:08.172
You're a detective.

08:08.173 --> 08:10.808
You're a detective!
Get out of here!

08:10.809 --> 08:14.078
Go! [sighs]

08:14.112 --> 08:15.946
Sir, Jake really pissed me off,

08:15.947 --> 08:17.848
and I want to help you
take him down.

08:17.849 --> 08:19.884
Well, that's
an intriguing proposition.

08:19.885 --> 08:21.819
You certainly could be useful...

08:21.853 --> 08:23.221
Thank you.

08:23.222 --> 08:24.889
To Jake!

08:24.923 --> 08:28.626
I got you, Peralta!
You're not fooling anyone!

08:28.627 --> 08:31.128
Why does everyone think
that's where a camera would be?

08:31.163 --> 08:34.965
Because the cleavage cloaks
the camera with its curves.

08:34.966 --> 08:37.434
That will be all, spy.

08:38.636 --> 08:41.371
- Sorry I said cleavage.
- Mm-hmm.

08:41.405 --> 08:45.076
Charles, that is so nasty you
put cockroaches in your pants.

08:45.077 --> 08:46.611
When you say it like that, yeah.

08:46.612 --> 08:47.812
But Jake made it sound so cool.

08:47.813 --> 08:48.913
How?
[knocks on door]

08:48.914 --> 08:51.182
Oh, I wasn't expecting anyone.

08:53.685 --> 08:56.487
- Come in, Nadia.
- Hey, Charles.

08:56.488 --> 08:57.788
What up, bro?

08:57.789 --> 09:00.024
Gina, this was the boy
I was telling you about.

09:00.025 --> 09:01.425
You're Nadia?

09:01.426 --> 09:04.261
Well, my real name's Leo;
Nadia's just my tag.

09:04.262 --> 09:06.664
I don't love it, but when Banksy
gives you a nickname,

09:06.665 --> 09:07.932
it just sticks.

09:07.933 --> 09:09.433
Okay, I see what's
going on here.

09:09.434 --> 09:11.736
This isn't a setup...
this is a setup.

09:11.770 --> 09:15.640
And all of this is supposed to
distract me from the heist.

09:15.674 --> 09:18.175
- The heist?
- [mocking tone] The heist?

09:18.176 --> 09:20.211
You shut your hot lips.

09:20.212 --> 09:21.512
<i>Charles, I don't buy it.</i>

09:21.546 --> 09:23.781
This is an obvious trap, okay?

09:23.782 --> 09:26.050
Who are you, really, hmm?

09:26.051 --> 09:29.387
You some male prostitute
that Charles busted

09:29.388 --> 09:31.689
out on some
lonely pier somewhere?

09:31.690 --> 09:33.524
Well, guess what, sweetie?

09:33.559 --> 09:36.894
This is one trick you ain't
gonna be turning tonight.

09:36.895 --> 09:38.296
I'm not a prostitute.

09:38.297 --> 09:39.297
Okay.

09:39.298 --> 09:40.298
[laughs]

09:40.299 --> 09:41.866
Right.
Bye-bye, whore.

09:43.468 --> 09:45.002
It's go time, Sergeant.

09:49.074 --> 09:50.374
Hey, Rosa.

09:50.375 --> 09:52.910
I'm not saying these are
from your motorcycle,

09:52.911 --> 09:55.413
but I found these
stripped handlebars outside.

09:55.447 --> 09:58.249
You better not have messed
with my bike for this heist.

09:58.250 --> 10:00.117
Let me remind you
I'm carrying a weapon.

10:00.152 --> 10:01.471
We all have the same weapons.

10:02.487 --> 10:04.589
Damn, Rosa!
Where'd you get that?

10:07.626 --> 10:10.127
The scorpion has left the nest.

10:10.128 --> 10:20.504
<i>♪

10:20.505 --> 10:22.073
And...

10:22.074 --> 10:23.040
Ding.

10:23.075 --> 10:24.075
[elevator dings]

10:24.076 --> 10:25.743
See Daddy?
Come on.

10:25.744 --> 10:28.779
Time for the twin twist.

10:28.780 --> 10:31.082
- Hey, Jake.
- Hey, you guys.

10:31.083 --> 10:32.984
We wanted to surprise Terry;
have you seen him?

10:32.985 --> 10:34.518
Oh, he just went downstairs
for a bit,

10:34.519 --> 10:35.620
but he should be back soon.

10:35.621 --> 10:37.288
Oh. Cagney? Lacey?

10:37.289 --> 10:39.523
Do you guys want to take
a picture with Uncle Jake?

10:39.524 --> 10:40.825
- Yeah!
- [laughs]

10:40.826 --> 10:42.660
You don't mind, do you?

10:42.661 --> 10:45.529
Um...
no, of course not.

10:45.530 --> 10:46.797
That would be so fun.

10:46.798 --> 10:48.266
<i>What if we do it
in the briefing room,</i>

10:48.267 --> 10:49.934
like you're assigning them
a case?

10:49.968 --> 10:52.203
No, I mean,
you know what would be fun...

10:52.204 --> 10:53.671
even more that that...

10:53.672 --> 10:56.807
is if we took a picture
right here,

10:56.808 --> 10:58.442
and I could have
my hand on this cabinet.

10:58.443 --> 10:59.510
Okay.

11:00.779 --> 11:03.147
- Nailed it.
- <i>Here we go.</i>

11:04.460 --> 11:06.384
Oh, God, it was in
video mode... sorry.

11:06.385 --> 11:09.120
<i>Take your time;
I could do this all day.</i>

11:09.121 --> 11:10.955
<i>Matter of fact,
what if we did one</i>

11:10.956 --> 11:13.324
where I had both hands
on the cabinet...

11:13.325 --> 11:16.494
one on top, and then one
on the front?

11:16.495 --> 11:18.162
Looks good, yeah.

11:18.163 --> 11:22.433
<i>All right, smile...
three, two, one...</i>

11:22.434 --> 11:25.269
Cheese! Very good.

11:25.270 --> 11:27.471
Great, you guys.
Let's go find Daddy.

11:27.472 --> 11:30.675
- [witch cackling]
- What's going on?

11:34.980 --> 11:36.649
Aha!
What are you doing?

11:36.682 --> 11:40.418
Nothing... just enjoying a taste
of my favorite beverage,

11:40.419 --> 11:41.819
the soda pop.

11:41.820 --> 11:45.323
Really? I have never seen you
enjoy soda pop before.

11:45.357 --> 11:47.725
- Hmm.
- Have some now.

11:56.501 --> 11:59.570
Ahh.

11:59.571 --> 12:01.138
- It's delicious.
- I don't buy it.

12:01.139 --> 12:03.040
You're making the same face
you made when you found

12:03.041 --> 12:04.302
a chocolate chip
in your trail mix.

12:04.309 --> 12:06.110
Something's up.
I'm patting you down.

12:07.913 --> 12:11.015
Damn it, nothing
but a surprisingly toned set of abs.

12:11.016 --> 12:12.350
Why would I have
the crown, Jake?

12:12.351 --> 12:14.018
Isn't it still
in the interrogation room?

12:14.019 --> 12:16.520
Yes. Yes.
Of course.

12:16.521 --> 12:18.656
Of course it's still in there.

12:18.690 --> 12:21.125
Welp, I guess
I'll see you at midnight.

12:21.126 --> 12:23.895
- After you.
- No, after you.

12:23.929 --> 12:25.696
I insist.

12:29.768 --> 12:31.302
[witch cackling]

12:31.303 --> 12:32.503
Ugh.

12:32.504 --> 12:33.738
You drank a soda?

12:33.739 --> 12:35.539
Not sure that's
the worst thing in the world.

12:35.574 --> 12:37.108
It was the worst thing
in the world...

12:37.109 --> 12:39.510
worse than a fruit-forward
Riesling.

12:39.511 --> 12:41.412
No, I'm not exaggerating.

12:41.413 --> 12:45.449
Anyhow, I cleverly ditched
the crown in a trash can...

12:45.450 --> 12:47.718
wait a minute... so as to not
arouse suspicion

12:47.719 --> 12:48.853
and then retrieve it.

12:48.854 --> 12:50.188
Got it.

12:50.189 --> 12:53.224
Hey... while I'm in there,
should I get you a soda?

12:53.258 --> 12:54.959
I know you're joking,
but on the off chance

12:54.960 --> 12:56.394
you aren't...

12:56.395 --> 12:58.062
No.

13:02.267 --> 13:03.968
- Hi, there.
- Oh, is it?

13:03.969 --> 13:05.469
The handlebar thing was fake.

13:05.470 --> 13:06.771
They were trying to distract me.

13:06.772 --> 13:08.239
I think they made
a play for the crown.

13:08.240 --> 13:10.508
I know, but I had my hand
on the cabinet the whole time,

13:10.509 --> 13:12.143
so I'm pretty confident
there's no way

13:12.144 --> 13:13.344
they could have gotten it.

13:13.345 --> 13:14.512
They got it.

13:14.513 --> 13:16.380
Look at the back.
Screws are loose.

13:16.415 --> 13:20.117
Damn it.
That son of a bitch is good.

13:20.118 --> 13:22.687
Sir, we got a problem.

13:22.688 --> 13:25.356
The crown wasn't in
the trash can.

13:25.357 --> 13:26.991
Jake must have taken it back.

13:26.992 --> 13:28.392
Damn it.

13:28.393 --> 13:30.322
That son of a bitch is good.

13:33.617 --> 13:34.917
We have to get that crown back.

13:34.918 --> 13:36.952
I already changed my email
to "kingjakerulez" with a z.

13:36.953 --> 13:38.587
Everyone's going to think
I'm an idiot.

13:38.588 --> 13:40.823
- Hello, Peralta.
- Captain.

13:40.824 --> 13:42.525
- Midnight nears.
- Yes, it does.

13:42.526 --> 13:45.611
- Tick tock.
- Tick tock indeed.

13:45.629 --> 13:48.297
But tick tock for who?

13:48.298 --> 13:49.398
You know it's "for whom."

13:49.399 --> 13:50.533
Don't try to provoke me.

13:50.534 --> 13:52.968
I didn't know that.

13:52.969 --> 13:54.570
Both: I'm going to get
that crown back.

13:54.571 --> 13:55.638
- Wait... what?
- Huh?

13:55.639 --> 13:58.107
Will you excuse me
for just one moment?

13:58.108 --> 14:00.309
Yes, I too need to be excused.

14:00.310 --> 14:01.944
[whispering]
He doesn't have the crown!

14:01.945 --> 14:03.179
Why you asked that?

14:03.180 --> 14:04.747
- I don't know who has it.
- What do we do?

14:04.748 --> 14:06.682
Pull the security tape.
I'll distract them.

14:06.683 --> 14:08.784
Hey, look at this.

14:08.785 --> 14:13.055
Ahhhhhhhhhh.

14:13.056 --> 14:14.657
Damn it, how did that not work?

14:14.658 --> 14:18.361
Hmm, Captain Holt said
you guys stole the crown

14:18.362 --> 14:19.795
when Jake came through
the ceiling.

14:19.796 --> 14:21.397
Yeah, I can't believe
you fell for that.

14:21.398 --> 14:22.999
You really think I'd mark
the wrong vent?

14:23.000 --> 14:25.034
I've never marked
a wrong vent in my life.

14:25.035 --> 14:26.610
You're very intense about vents.

14:26.637 --> 14:27.770
Yeah.

14:27.771 --> 14:29.530
Wait... so Nadia wasn't
just a distraction?

14:29.539 --> 14:31.741
No, 100% real.

14:31.742 --> 14:34.910
Handsome, cool, hair as thick
as a collie's.

14:34.911 --> 14:37.146
I found you the perfect guy,
and you drove him off.

14:37.180 --> 14:38.848
Ugh. I'm sorry.

14:38.849 --> 14:40.616
I should have trusted you.

14:40.617 --> 14:42.685
Please call him
and tell him I messed up.

14:42.686 --> 14:44.820
Fine, but only if you
agree that your first date

14:44.821 --> 14:46.856
will be a double date
with me and Genevieve

14:46.857 --> 14:48.224
on a week-long trip to Turk's...

14:48.225 --> 14:49.959
Forget it, no.
Forget it.

14:49.960 --> 14:51.027
No! Okay, I'll call him.

14:51.061 --> 14:52.662
Please, I want this so badly.

14:52.663 --> 14:55.631
Fine, you may call him for me.

14:55.632 --> 14:57.900
Thank you.

14:57.901 --> 15:00.369
Okay, here I am taking
pictures with Terry's kids.

15:00.404 --> 15:02.672
Man, I look so strong
standing next to them.

15:02.673 --> 15:03.739
- Should I have kids?
- Sure.

15:03.740 --> 15:04.907
Okay.

15:04.908 --> 15:07.376
It's Holt.
Whoa, how did he do that?

15:07.377 --> 15:08.945
Guy has an insane set of abs.

15:08.946 --> 15:11.080
Oh, look, he's got the crown.

15:11.081 --> 15:12.406
And he's headed to
the break room.

15:12.416 --> 15:13.749
He dumped it in the trash.

15:13.750 --> 15:14.884
Did he go back and get it?

15:14.885 --> 15:18.487
Nope, janitor came in
and took it.

15:18.488 --> 15:19.555
But which janitor?

15:19.556 --> 15:21.090
Looks like I'm going to
have to squint.

15:24.661 --> 15:27.263
His name is Al...
Al the janitor.

15:27.264 --> 15:29.532
All right, it's 11:00 P.M. now;
That means Al's long gone.

15:29.533 --> 15:31.100
How are we going to
get his home address?

15:31.101 --> 15:33.002
Who's the one person you know
who's anal enough

15:33.003 --> 15:35.905
to send out holiday cards
to every single employee?

15:37.207 --> 15:39.976
- Amy!
- What do you want, Jake?

15:39.977 --> 15:42.578
What? Why would you assume
that I want anything?

15:42.579 --> 15:45.147
What I want is to apologize
to my girlfriend,

15:45.148 --> 15:46.349
who I hurt.

15:46.350 --> 15:47.416
It's "whom."

15:47.417 --> 15:48.818
Why does the word "who"
even exist

15:48.819 --> 15:50.052
if you're not allowed to say it?

15:50.053 --> 15:51.687
Anyways,
now that I've apologized

15:51.688 --> 15:55.558
and you've accepted, can you
give me janitor Al's address?

15:55.559 --> 15:57.727
This is related
to your heist, isn't it?

15:57.728 --> 16:00.596
No, no.
It's about a crime.

16:00.597 --> 16:03.399
I think janitor Al is
going to kill the president.

16:03.400 --> 16:05.801
Oh, Santiago.
There's my protégé.

16:05.802 --> 16:07.837
Let me guess...
you want the janitor's address.

16:07.871 --> 16:10.906
Janitor? Address? Al?

16:10.941 --> 16:12.708
I never said his name.

16:12.709 --> 16:15.211
Well, isn't this rich.

16:15.245 --> 16:17.613
After being excluded
by both of you,

16:17.614 --> 16:18.915
here I am with the power
to decide

16:18.916 --> 16:21.784
who wins and who loses
your little heist.

16:21.785 --> 16:23.386
I wouldn't have it
any other way.

16:23.387 --> 16:25.321
You are my wisest detective.

16:25.355 --> 16:28.658
Pathetic.
She can't be manipulated, sir.

16:28.659 --> 16:30.393
Amy, we are in love.

16:30.394 --> 16:31.727
I know we've never
said it before,

16:31.728 --> 16:33.562
but I think this is
the perfect time, don't you?

16:33.563 --> 16:35.031
Love? Ha.

16:35.032 --> 16:38.234
What's love compared to
the respect of a workplace superior?

16:38.235 --> 16:40.269
Amy Santiago, will you m...

16:40.270 --> 16:41.871
- Enough!
- Okay.

16:41.872 --> 16:43.940
Pretending to be nice to me
is worse than being mean.

16:43.941 --> 16:46.876
You know what?
You want the address?

16:46.877 --> 16:51.147
Here, you can both have it.

16:51.148 --> 16:52.982
[cell phones ringing]

16:52.983 --> 16:55.184
Hope you're happy,
you selfish monsters.

16:56.520 --> 16:58.387
- I feel terrible.
- We should apologize.

16:58.388 --> 16:59.689
Yes, I agree.

16:59.690 --> 17:01.924
You definitely should now;
I'll do mine later.

17:01.959 --> 17:03.392
Fat chance.

17:03.393 --> 17:05.294
Charles, I need your butt.
Meet me downstairs.

17:05.295 --> 17:06.896
Alpha Team, this is
the Golden Sparrow.

17:06.896 --> 17:08.564
Rendezvous at Drop Zone Yankee.

17:08.565 --> 17:10.500
When did you come up
with those code names?

17:12.736 --> 17:14.436
Okay, he lives on
the sixteenth floor.

17:14.438 --> 17:15.538
I think we beat Holt here.

17:15.539 --> 17:17.874
- Or did you?
- I'll get the elevator.

17:17.875 --> 17:20.343
Crap! Looks like
we're taking the stairs.

17:22.112 --> 17:25.281
All right, it's sixteen floors...
pace yourselves.

17:25.281 --> 17:26.983
Forget it.
Run as fast as you can!

17:30.120 --> 17:33.356
[panting]

17:33.357 --> 17:36.592
[knocks] Ha ha!

17:36.627 --> 17:38.995
I win. I knocked first.

17:40.397 --> 17:41.397
You're not Al.

17:41.398 --> 17:42.723
You're looking for Al?

17:42.733 --> 17:44.934
Of course we're looking
for Al, you imbecile!

17:44.935 --> 17:47.303
Sorry.

17:47.304 --> 17:49.138
He's having a cigarette
on the roof.

17:49.139 --> 17:50.473
The roof?

17:52.876 --> 17:55.845
[panting]

17:55.846 --> 17:58.114
Yes.
I did it.

17:58.115 --> 18:00.383
I am the greatest
athlete in the world.

18:00.384 --> 18:02.218
[vomits]

18:02.219 --> 18:04.086
Al? Al?

18:04.087 --> 18:06.422
Where's Al?

18:06.423 --> 18:08.324
Oh, there he is.
There he is!

18:08.325 --> 18:10.359
I did it. I did it.

18:10.360 --> 18:11.894
[vomits]

18:11.895 --> 18:13.629
Good God.

18:13.630 --> 18:15.665
Are you Al the janitor?

18:15.666 --> 18:19.001
Nope.
I'm your worst nightmare.

18:19.002 --> 18:21.103
Amy Santiago.

18:21.104 --> 18:23.739
Oh, no.

18:26.554 --> 18:30.390
I don't understand
what is happening.

18:30.391 --> 18:32.559
Allow me to explain.

18:32.560 --> 18:35.896
Amy and I were ahead of you
the whole time.

18:35.897 --> 18:38.131
No, you weren't part of this.

18:38.132 --> 18:40.267
Get back over to
the loser side, loser.

18:40.268 --> 18:41.281
All right.
Worth a shot.

18:41.302 --> 18:42.469
So how'd you pull it off?

18:42.470 --> 18:44.738
Well, it all started
when I went to tell Jake

18:44.739 --> 18:46.807
how badly he hurt my feelings,

18:46.808 --> 18:48.675
and he yelled at my breasts.

18:48.676 --> 18:51.078
Oh, boy, I am not going to
come off well in this story.

18:51.079 --> 18:52.145
Nope.

18:52.146 --> 18:53.580
Remember when you
set off the witch?

18:53.581 --> 18:54.948
[witch cackling]

18:54.949 --> 18:56.783
<i>You made Captain Holt
flinch, which was weird,</i>

18:56.784 --> 18:58.185
<i>since his door was closed,</i>

18:58.186 --> 19:00.520
<i>but not weird, since
he actually heard it over a bug</i>

19:00.521 --> 19:01.955
<i>he planted at your desk.</i>

19:01.956 --> 19:04.124
It was in an old muffin that you
never threw in the trash.

19:04.125 --> 19:06.193
That's why people
throw away garbage.

19:06.227 --> 19:07.224
How are we together?

19:07.228 --> 19:08.462
Eh.

19:08.463 --> 19:10.564
Anyway, I tapped into
the bug's frequencies,

19:10.565 --> 19:12.366
so I had ears on Jake.

19:12.367 --> 19:13.800
<i>I needed to know
what Holt was up to.</i>

19:13.801 --> 19:15.802
That's where Hitchcock came in.

19:15.803 --> 19:17.771
I masterminded the entire plan.

19:17.772 --> 19:20.240
You did one small thing,
and I had to explain it to you,

19:20.241 --> 19:21.608
like, 45 times.

19:21.609 --> 19:23.410
<i>He left a tiny crack
in the blind,</i>

19:23.411 --> 19:24.778
<i>so I could read
the Captain's lips.</i>

19:24.812 --> 19:27.114
<i>"Sharon and your kids
will distract Jake.</i>

19:27.115 --> 19:28.871
<i>"They'll be here at 9:30 sharp.</i>

19:28.883 --> 19:31.618
<i>My waffle xylophone
on the cheese man."</i>

19:31.619 --> 19:32.619
What?

19:32.620 --> 19:33.920
My lip-reading is not flawless.

19:33.955 --> 19:35.255
<i>Now that I knew your plan,</i>

19:35.290 --> 19:36.523
it was simple to disrupt.

19:36.557 --> 19:38.425
<i>While Scully gracefully
moved the witch,</i>

19:38.459 --> 19:39.960
<i>I got into character.</i>

19:39.961 --> 19:41.028
<i>Holt triggered the witch,</i>

19:41.029 --> 19:42.396
<i>which brought Jake
into the room.</i>

19:42.397 --> 19:44.331
And I threw the crown
in the trash can.

19:44.332 --> 19:46.233
Exactly as I planned.

19:46.234 --> 19:49.469
Then I sent you all here,
placed an out-of-order sign

19:49.470 --> 19:52.406
on the perfectly
functional elevator,

19:52.407 --> 19:54.107
made you all walk up
31 flights of stairs

19:54.142 --> 19:55.609
and vomit twice.

19:55.610 --> 19:56.777
Actually, it was four times,

19:56.778 --> 19:59.079
if you count all
the stairwell stuff.

19:59.080 --> 20:00.861
You thought I was
just Holt's lackey.

20:00.882 --> 20:03.283
And you thought I was
just Jake's girlfriend.

20:03.317 --> 20:05.252
Well, I'm my own person,

20:05.253 --> 20:07.387
capable of making
my own decisions,

20:07.388 --> 20:09.523
and I decided to
humiliate you both.

20:09.557 --> 20:13.794
Well, you did,
and it was awesome.

20:13.795 --> 20:16.897
One last question:
where's the crown?

20:16.898 --> 20:18.532
Oh, it's at Shaw's Bar,

20:18.533 --> 20:21.301
the official site
of my coronation.

20:21.302 --> 20:23.470
All hail the crown of destiny.

20:23.504 --> 20:26.607
[cheers]

20:26.608 --> 20:31.411
And all hail she who wears it,
Amy Santiago, the...

20:31.412 --> 20:33.046
Queen.

20:33.047 --> 20:34.881
Queen of the nine-nine.

20:34.882 --> 20:36.283
[cheers]

20:36.284 --> 20:37.684
I believe there's something else

20:37.685 --> 20:38.852
you both need to say.

20:38.853 --> 20:39.886
<i>Gladly.</i>

20:39.887 --> 20:40.988
Both: Amy Santiago

20:40.989 --> 20:44.224
is an amazing detective/genius.

20:44.225 --> 20:45.525
Drinks are on us.

20:45.526 --> 20:47.561
- Nope.
- Drinks are on me.

20:47.562 --> 20:49.062
Yeah!

20:50.965 --> 20:53.767
Hey.

20:53.768 --> 20:55.369
I'm glad you showed up.

20:55.370 --> 20:57.604
Sorry I was acting
so weird earlier.

20:57.605 --> 21:00.641
Hey, I don't blame you.
Sagittarius, right?

21:00.642 --> 21:02.910
With Saturn where it is,
you're right to be wary

21:02.911 --> 21:04.277
of new relationships.

21:04.278 --> 21:08.148
How is it possible
that a spirit such as yourself

21:08.149 --> 21:09.516
even knows Charles?

21:09.517 --> 21:11.485
I did an art show
at Genevieve's gallery.

21:11.486 --> 21:14.154
Oh, right... so you're not
really friends,

21:14.155 --> 21:17.024
you know his girlfriend
through the art world.

21:17.025 --> 21:19.126
Yeah, plus,
she's my twin sister.

21:19.127 --> 21:20.360
What?

21:20.361 --> 21:22.362
Hi, Leo.
A kiss for my bro.

21:22.363 --> 21:23.997
And a kiss for my beau.

21:23.998 --> 21:25.032
No.

21:25.033 --> 21:26.066
A kiss for my beau.

21:26.067 --> 21:27.868
And a kiss for my sis.

21:27.869 --> 21:29.036
No!
