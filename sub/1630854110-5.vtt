00:04.395 --> 00:06.484
<i>Dr. Ben Song
risked everything</i>

00:06.528 --> 00:08.704
<i>when he used
the Quantum Leap Accelerator</i>

00:08.747 --> 00:10.575
<i>to travel back in time.</i>

00:10.619 --> 00:13.448
<i>Now our team's working
to find out why.</i>

00:13.491 --> 00:17.234
<i>As he leaps between bodies
with no memory of who he is,</i>

00:17.278 --> 00:19.323
<i>he still has one hope--</i>

00:19.367 --> 00:23.632
<i>that his next leap
takes him back</i>

00:23.675 --> 00:27.897
<i>to the place
and people he calls home.</i>

00:32.249 --> 00:34.730
You just got here
and now you want to leave?

00:34.773 --> 00:36.558
Put the suitcases down!

00:37.820 --> 00:40.344
Did you even read
the letter that I wrote you?

00:40.388 --> 00:42.303
I don't want to go
to San Francisco.

00:42.346 --> 00:44.566
You know, Papa
warned me about you.

00:44.609 --> 00:47.177
He said you were
selfish and cold,

00:47.221 --> 00:49.136
and I didn't believe him.

00:49.179 --> 00:52.095
I remember you
from when I was little.

00:52.139 --> 00:53.792
You were my <i>abuelo,</i>

00:53.836 --> 00:56.708
and I was your <i>
pequeñita</i> Valentina.

00:56.752 --> 00:59.798
I could see in your eyes
how much you cared for me.

00:59.842 --> 01:01.365
Maybe I was wrong.

01:01.409 --> 01:04.151
Let's--um,
can we just start again?

01:04.194 --> 01:05.674
As I'm getting
older, it's just--

01:05.717 --> 01:08.633
Papa built this town
for all of us.

01:08.677 --> 01:10.809
He was your son,

01:10.853 --> 01:14.117
and this is how you choose
to honor his memory?

01:14.161 --> 01:16.685
You're--you're upset,
I get it,

01:16.728 --> 01:18.730
but maybe we can start
from the beginning.

01:18.774 --> 01:19.949
Can we--

02:01.382 --> 02:02.644
He remembered you.

02:02.687 --> 02:03.993
He did.

02:04.036 --> 02:05.734
I didn't prompt him.

02:05.777 --> 02:07.431
We knew it would
happen eventually.

02:07.475 --> 02:09.868
Magic, I know you're worried
about Ben's motivations,

02:09.912 --> 02:11.087
about why he left,

02:11.131 --> 02:12.523
about why he didn't
say anything.

02:12.567 --> 02:14.525
And I know that you didn't
want me to jog his memory

02:14.569 --> 02:16.701
because our only safeguard was

02:16.745 --> 02:18.399
that if he didn't
remember anything,

02:18.442 --> 02:20.879
then he couldn't remember
his agenda.

02:20.923 --> 02:22.098
That's true.

02:22.142 --> 02:23.621
But his memory
is coming back.

02:23.665 --> 02:26.189
And I think it's a mistake
not to use that at this--

02:26.233 --> 02:28.191
I agree.

02:28.235 --> 02:31.325
You don't have to sell me.

02:31.368 --> 02:33.718
Things have changed since then.

02:33.762 --> 02:35.285
Janice is in our system.

02:35.329 --> 02:37.157
She's stolen
government hardware.

02:37.200 --> 02:39.463
This is a fluid,
active situation

02:39.507 --> 02:41.639
we just don't understand yet.

02:41.683 --> 02:43.989
Ben trusts you,
now even more so

02:44.033 --> 02:45.513
since he remembers you.

02:45.556 --> 02:48.646
At this point, any insight
he has into what is happening

02:48.690 --> 02:52.084
is information we sorely need.

02:52.128 --> 02:55.740
That's a long way of saying,

02:55.784 --> 02:58.787
you don't have
to hold back anymore.

02:58.830 --> 03:00.658
Thank you, Magic.

03:00.702 --> 03:01.877
Thank you.

03:01.920 --> 03:03.966
I know how hard it's been.

03:04.009 --> 03:05.881
Yeah.

03:08.797 --> 03:10.233
Ian has him.

03:10.277 --> 03:12.061
Where is he?

03:12.104 --> 03:14.324
That cannot be right.

03:16.892 --> 03:18.894
1879?

03:20.983 --> 03:23.507
Ladies and gentlemen
of Salvation,

03:23.551 --> 03:25.335
I come before you on behalf

03:25.379 --> 03:27.511
of the estimable
Board of Directors

03:27.555 --> 03:29.861
for the Southwest
Pacific Railroad Company

03:29.905 --> 03:32.386
to remind you that
the deadline for you to accept

03:32.429 --> 03:34.126
their offering
of a rather generous

03:34.170 --> 03:37.695
and life-changing compensation
for your land and property

03:37.739 --> 03:40.698
presently draws a pace.
- Who is that guy?

03:40.742 --> 03:42.700
Salvation had its heyday
during the Gold Rush,

03:42.744 --> 03:44.702
but those days are long gone.

03:44.746 --> 03:47.270
This here boomtown's
gone bust.

03:47.314 --> 03:50.404
Well, good riddance, I say!

03:50.447 --> 03:52.362
This town ain't
worth fighting for.

03:52.406 --> 03:53.842
Fishing's no good.

03:53.885 --> 03:55.147
Hunting's no good.

03:55.191 --> 03:57.367
Ain't nothing left to trap.

03:57.411 --> 03:58.542
Hush your mouth, Joe.

03:58.586 --> 04:00.457
Go inside and get
another drink.

04:00.501 --> 04:02.851
Should you choose to reject
my employer's offer,

04:02.894 --> 04:04.940
they have empowered
me and my posse here

04:04.983 --> 04:07.421
to see to your
permanent relocation,

04:07.464 --> 04:10.902
at which point
all that was once yours

04:10.946 --> 04:12.426
will become theirs.

04:12.469 --> 04:15.298
We told your employer we
reject their paltry offer--

04:15.342 --> 04:16.908
Tell them, Sheriff.

04:16.952 --> 04:19.346
and to inform you that we
have petitioned the governor

04:19.389 --> 04:20.999
against the railroad's claims--

04:25.134 --> 04:28.833
Ain't no sheriff or governor
gonna help you out here!

04:28.877 --> 04:32.576
No one cares, which is to say,
in summation,

04:32.620 --> 04:35.100
resist me at your own peril.

04:36.798 --> 04:40.062
Citizens of Salvation,
you know who I am,

04:40.105 --> 04:42.325
so you know what this town
means to me,

04:42.369 --> 04:44.632
which is why I'm
asking you to ignore

04:44.675 --> 04:46.416
this

04:46.460 --> 04:48.157
and remember
my father's vision

04:48.200 --> 04:49.506
for this place.

04:49.550 --> 04:51.291
And here's the good news--

04:51.334 --> 04:54.119
Salvation's salvation has
already arrived.

04:54.163 --> 04:55.947
Oh, no, no.

04:55.991 --> 04:59.951
Who pray tell is this
savior come to deliver y'all?

04:59.995 --> 05:02.954
The legendary gunslinger, <i>
mi abuelo,</i>

05:02.998 --> 05:05.130
Diego de la Cruz!

05:09.831 --> 05:11.093
Him?

05:11.136 --> 05:12.616
I've heard of you, old-timer.

05:12.660 --> 05:15.053
If you're the savior, these
people are already damned.

05:15.097 --> 05:17.969
Look, no one here wants
any further violence.

05:18.013 --> 05:20.624
Maybe, uh, there's some other
arrangement we can work out.

05:20.668 --> 05:22.104
Only one way out, partner.

05:22.147 --> 05:24.541
Either you convince these folks
to pick up sticks

05:24.585 --> 05:27.327
and get the hell out of dodge

05:27.370 --> 05:29.198
or there will be blood.

05:46.128 --> 05:49.827
Valentina, I want to help,
I really do.

05:49.871 --> 05:53.440
It's just your <i>abuelo</i> isn't
the man he used to be,

05:53.483 --> 05:55.267
especially not
at this specific moment.

05:56.791 --> 05:58.880
I know just what you need.

06:00.664 --> 06:02.362
What I need is--

06:02.405 --> 06:04.102
Howdy, stranger.

06:04.146 --> 06:05.277
You're looking for me?

06:05.321 --> 06:06.888
Addison!

06:09.934 --> 06:11.980
I'm sorry it took me
so long to remember you.

06:12.023 --> 06:14.635
I'm sorry I couldn't
say anything,

06:14.678 --> 06:17.942
but at least now you know.

06:19.727 --> 06:22.207
I have so many questions.

06:22.251 --> 06:23.731
I know.

06:23.774 --> 06:26.995
We knew that there would be
some gaps in your memory.

06:27.038 --> 06:29.519
Uh, but let's not worry
about that right now.

06:29.563 --> 06:30.825
Let's figure out what
you're here to do

06:30.868 --> 06:32.130
so we can get you out of here.

06:32.174 --> 06:34.568
Yes, whatever gets me
back to you faster.

06:35.917 --> 06:37.222
Yeah.

06:37.266 --> 06:40.530
OK, so it says here that
you are Diego de la Cruz,

06:40.574 --> 06:43.490
a famed Mexican-American
gunslinger who hung up

06:43.533 --> 06:46.101
his six-shooters and retired
to San Francisco

06:46.144 --> 06:47.537
after your wife died.

06:47.581 --> 06:49.670
Your son, Marco, was
the mayor of this town,

06:49.713 --> 06:51.323
but he too died recently.

06:51.367 --> 06:53.978
Which is why Valentina sent
that letter asking for help.

06:54.022 --> 06:55.806
- You met the granddaughter?
- Oh, yeah.

06:55.850 --> 06:57.112
Cute kid.

06:57.155 --> 06:58.461
She just promised a
whole town that I'd fight

06:58.505 --> 07:01.203
some outlaw named McDonough.

07:01.246 --> 07:03.684
Please tell me Diego didn't
lose this fight.

07:03.727 --> 07:05.294
Actually, he never fought.

07:05.337 --> 07:07.905
Uh, It looks like Diego
and Valentina skipped town,

07:07.949 --> 07:09.951
so there was no showdown.
- That's a relief.

07:09.994 --> 07:13.128
Because I, uh, kind of feel
like I hate guns.

07:13.171 --> 07:15.652
Does that line up
with the Ben you knew?

07:15.696 --> 07:17.872
Yeah. You're a pacifist.

07:17.915 --> 07:20.440
I mean, I can't be here
to win a gun fight.

07:20.483 --> 07:22.485
To jump back in time
to kill someone?

07:22.529 --> 07:24.444
That feels wrong.
- Yeah.

07:24.487 --> 07:26.358
Deeply, cosmically wrong.

07:26.402 --> 07:28.535
OK.

07:28.578 --> 07:31.451
Records in this era
were spotty at best.

07:31.494 --> 07:34.018
I'm having a really hard time
accessing our database,

07:34.062 --> 07:35.759
probably because we're
so far back in time.

07:35.803 --> 07:37.544
OK, I'm gonna go back
and talk to the team

07:37.587 --> 07:39.415
and see what info they
can rustle up, OK?

07:39.459 --> 07:41.156
OK. Hey, hurry.

07:41.199 --> 07:43.463
Um...

07:43.506 --> 07:46.117
the whole cowboy thing works.

07:46.161 --> 07:47.815
You think?

07:47.858 --> 07:50.992
Well, this whole hologram
thing is also working.

07:52.776 --> 07:53.908
- OK.
- OK.

08:02.351 --> 08:03.831
I'm Frankie.

08:03.874 --> 08:06.486
It's a pleasure to finally
make your acquaintance, señor.

08:06.529 --> 08:08.662
I was real close to your son.

08:09.837 --> 08:12.622
His passing was a--

08:12.666 --> 08:15.277
was a loss for us all.

08:15.320 --> 08:17.758
I've been looking after
Valentina like she was my own,

08:17.801 --> 08:19.237
not that she much needs it.

08:19.281 --> 08:21.370
Most certainly do not.

08:21.413 --> 08:22.893
Thank you.

08:22.937 --> 08:24.373
What's mine is yours.

08:24.416 --> 08:25.766
What can I tempt you with?

08:25.809 --> 08:27.550
It's on the house.

08:27.594 --> 08:29.552
Oh, that's very--

08:29.596 --> 08:30.814
thank you.

08:30.858 --> 08:34.470
Thank you,
but I'm recently engaged.

08:34.514 --> 08:36.516
Whiskey it is, then.

08:36.559 --> 08:37.865
Just water, please.

08:39.649 --> 08:41.259
Here you are.

08:41.303 --> 08:42.652
Oh, sorry, I said water.

08:42.696 --> 08:43.871
That is the water,
which is why

08:43.914 --> 08:45.916
most people go for the whiskey.

08:45.960 --> 08:47.570
Great.

08:50.399 --> 08:53.228
Aren't you a little young
to be in a place like this?

08:53.271 --> 08:55.360
I'm 15.

08:55.404 --> 08:57.841
Look, I'm starting to see
why Salvation

08:57.885 --> 08:59.277
might not be the best place
for you.

08:59.321 --> 09:02.585
Between the outlaws
and all the boarded-up shops,

09:02.629 --> 09:04.021
this place is looking
pretty bleak.

09:04.065 --> 09:05.675
Ever since that
gold vein dried up,

09:05.719 --> 09:07.503
so did everything
else around here.

09:07.547 --> 09:09.200
Then why stay?

09:09.244 --> 09:11.289
There are other towns.

09:11.333 --> 09:13.204
Not like Salvation.

09:13.248 --> 09:16.991
This place was built
by outsiders, for outsiders.

09:17.034 --> 09:19.471
Back in normal society,
a woman like me

09:19.515 --> 09:20.734
can't even get a bank loan.

09:20.777 --> 09:23.258
And look at me now,
sole proprietor

09:23.301 --> 09:24.607
of this here saloon.

09:24.651 --> 09:26.130
I busted my ass
for all that I have.

09:26.174 --> 09:28.219
I'm not just gonna
walk away from it.

09:28.263 --> 09:29.438
See?

09:29.481 --> 09:31.005
It's not just me.

09:31.048 --> 09:33.007
And there's only one way
to protect it.

09:37.359 --> 09:39.840
Your son asked me
to keep these safe.

09:39.883 --> 09:42.190
Your wife sent them
to him before she died,

09:42.233 --> 09:45.367
said she hoped they'd
bring you two back together.

09:47.108 --> 09:49.893
Trust me, violence
only begets more violence.

09:49.937 --> 09:51.199
Where I'm from,
there are better ways

09:51.242 --> 09:53.201
to handle things like this.
- Really?

09:53.244 --> 09:55.595
And what pray tell do
they do in San Francisco?

09:55.638 --> 09:57.118
That's not where I'm f--

09:57.161 --> 09:58.554
act--actually,

09:58.598 --> 10:00.556
San Francisco would
throw money at the problem.

10:00.600 --> 10:01.905
Well, we ain't
got none of that.

10:01.949 --> 10:03.907
Not yet, but if--

10:03.951 --> 10:05.735
let me talk
to the Sheriff's deputies.

10:05.779 --> 10:07.258
I think I have an idea.

10:16.006 --> 10:18.356
OK, and I'm gonna
need everything

10:18.400 --> 10:20.794
you've got on the Old West.

10:20.837 --> 10:23.274
Well, uh, OK,
it's not that Ziggy and I

10:23.318 --> 10:25.189
couldn't get you everything
that there was to know

10:25.233 --> 10:27.191
about one of the most
overly romanticized

10:27.235 --> 10:29.977
and completely misrepresented
periods of American history.

10:30.020 --> 10:32.109
But in order for me to narrow
down my search parameters,

10:32.153 --> 10:33.807
if you just gave me
like a specific detail.

10:33.850 --> 10:35.460
- Sure.
- Hey, later.

10:35.504 --> 10:37.201
We got to pretend like we're
not in the middle of a leap,

10:37.245 --> 10:38.333
like, right now.

10:38.376 --> 10:39.682
Yeah, we can't do that.

10:39.726 --> 10:40.727
Ben needs this
information right now.

10:40.770 --> 10:42.380
He is in 1879.

10:42.424 --> 10:44.774
Which is an unauthorized
activity that we've

10:44.818 --> 10:46.689
been keeping secret,
something that maybe

10:46.733 --> 10:48.517
our friends in Congress
who fund us

10:48.560 --> 10:49.736
probably shouldn't hear about.

10:49.779 --> 10:51.128
Why--why would they?

10:51.172 --> 10:52.739
And why are you
talking like this?

10:52.782 --> 10:55.350
That's why.

10:55.393 --> 10:57.134
OK, so who's trouble
in a power suit?

10:57.178 --> 10:58.701
Congresswoman Kavita Adani.

10:58.745 --> 11:00.485
She's the member of the
project's oversight committee

11:00.529 --> 11:02.052
and a rising star in DC.

11:02.096 --> 11:04.315
Jenn, why did you not
tell us that she was coming?

11:04.359 --> 11:05.839
Because I just found
out two minutes ago.

11:05.882 --> 11:08.450
She just showed up,
out of nowhere.

11:08.493 --> 11:09.886
She's got clearance.

11:09.930 --> 11:12.497
Congresswoman, to what
do we owe the pleasure?

11:12.541 --> 11:14.325
Since I've been sitting
on your oversight committee

11:14.369 --> 11:15.892
for the last few terms,
I thought,

11:15.936 --> 11:17.502
why not come check
it out for myself?

11:17.546 --> 11:20.027
Plus, I heard your team has
been making great strides.

11:20.070 --> 11:21.681
Where'd you hear that from?

11:21.724 --> 11:23.117
Our mutual friends
at the Pentagon.

11:23.160 --> 11:24.727
They mentioned that
there have been

11:24.771 --> 11:27.295
several spikes in the energy
consumption of this facility.

11:27.338 --> 11:30.341
Those are actually
just some random surges.

11:30.385 --> 11:32.517
You know who would
really put my mind at ease?

11:32.561 --> 11:33.997
Dr. Song.

11:34.041 --> 11:36.304
I'd love to get
his expert scientific opinion

11:36.347 --> 11:37.609
on the status of things.

11:37.653 --> 11:39.437
You want to see Ben, now?

11:39.481 --> 11:42.005
- He's here, isn't he?
- Not at the moment.

11:42.049 --> 11:44.573
Something came up,
a personal matter.

11:44.616 --> 11:46.401
He's currently off-site.

11:46.444 --> 11:47.837
Until when?

11:47.881 --> 11:49.752
Well, he wasn't
exactly clear on that,

11:49.796 --> 11:51.754
but, uh, I'll have
him reach out to you

11:51.798 --> 11:54.017
as soon as he gets back.

11:54.061 --> 11:55.976
Now, if there's nothing else--

11:56.019 --> 11:58.065
Actually, while I'm here
getting the lay of the land,

11:58.108 --> 12:00.328
I'd love to have a chat
with your team.

12:00.371 --> 12:02.722
Perhaps you could arrange
a sit-down with them,

12:02.765 --> 12:06.334
each of them, separately, now.

12:10.730 --> 12:12.166
Ben!

12:12.209 --> 12:13.471
Hey!

12:13.515 --> 12:14.734
Perfect timing.

12:14.777 --> 12:15.822
What have you got?

12:15.865 --> 12:17.084
On Diego? Not much.

12:17.127 --> 12:20.130
Just his obituary from 1886.

12:20.174 --> 12:23.438
Diego de la Cruz was found
dead from liver failure

12:23.481 --> 12:26.093
in his boardinghouse
outside of San Francisco.

12:26.136 --> 12:28.356
The West really was as bleak
as the history books

12:28.399 --> 12:29.487
made it out to be.

12:29.531 --> 12:30.924
Sounds like he dragged
Valentino off

12:30.967 --> 12:32.490
to San Francisco,
and everything went

12:32.534 --> 12:34.188
horribly wrong after that.

12:34.231 --> 12:35.842
Maybe--
maybe that's my mission,

12:35.885 --> 12:37.887
to keep those two together?

12:37.931 --> 12:39.497
Yeah, according to Ziggy,

12:39.541 --> 12:41.021
your mission is much bigger
than two people.

12:41.064 --> 12:43.588
It's about all of Salvation.

12:43.632 --> 12:46.766
Look, after Diego skipped
out on the showdown,

12:46.809 --> 12:49.159
McDonough drove the people out.

12:49.203 --> 12:52.206
The railroad took over,
and Salvation disappeared.

12:52.249 --> 12:55.252
I mean, practically, it
was erased from the map.

12:55.296 --> 12:56.993
But I had an idea.
- Yeah?

12:57.037 --> 12:58.995
McDonough is a wanted man.

12:59.039 --> 13:02.216
There's a huge reward out
for him and his gang,

13:02.259 --> 13:06.046
maybe enough to pay off
the railroad and save the town.

13:06.089 --> 13:07.917
What?
- Nothing.

13:07.961 --> 13:10.267
I-- we're on the same page.

13:10.311 --> 13:13.096
I was on my way to talk
to the deputies.

13:13.140 --> 13:16.534
Um, those deputies?

13:18.188 --> 13:21.104
They're not riding out
to stop McDonough, are they?

13:21.148 --> 13:22.976
Afraid not, señor.

13:23.019 --> 13:24.455
They're quitting.

13:24.499 --> 13:27.110
Quitting? But why?

13:27.154 --> 13:30.113
Because I made 'em
a better offer.

13:30.157 --> 13:33.551
They're not coming back,
so what's your price?

13:33.595 --> 13:35.292
I won't take your money.

13:35.336 --> 13:37.642
And I can't let you
hurt these people.

13:41.777 --> 13:44.736
I'm sure you dealt with
some bad hombres in your past,

13:44.780 --> 13:48.044
but you ain't never
met one like me.

13:48.088 --> 13:50.655
Leave this town while you can.

13:54.050 --> 13:57.314
This is gonna end badly,
isn't it?

13:57.358 --> 14:01.928
Uh, you're not gonna
like this, Ben.

14:01.971 --> 14:04.365
Ziggy says there's an 87%
chance you have

14:04.408 --> 14:07.498
to duel Josiah McDonough
to save the town.

14:17.117 --> 14:19.467
Ah, this can't be right.

14:19.510 --> 14:20.947
Look, Ziggy says that--

14:20.990 --> 14:23.123
Ziggy isn't the one who
has to live with this choice.

14:23.166 --> 14:25.125
I'm the person standing
here in the past.

14:25.168 --> 14:26.909
I'm the person that's
gonna have a man's life

14:26.953 --> 14:28.606
on his conscience
if I do this.

14:28.650 --> 14:30.043
Does it make you feel
any better that this

14:30.086 --> 14:32.567
is a really, really bad man?

14:32.610 --> 14:34.917
I mean, I can read you
a list of atrocities

14:34.961 --> 14:36.658
that he has committed,
and this is just

14:36.701 --> 14:39.052
the things history knows about.
- I get it.

14:39.095 --> 14:41.881
I believe there are non-violent
solutions to every problem.

14:41.924 --> 14:45.667
Yeah, we've always
disagreed on that.

14:45.710 --> 14:48.365
I was in the military,
and I know sometimes

14:48.409 --> 14:50.802
there's just no getting
around it.

14:50.846 --> 14:54.023
Sometimes, you have
to meet force with force.

14:54.067 --> 14:55.764
OK, but even if--

14:56.765 --> 14:58.158
Have I ever fired a gun?

14:58.201 --> 14:59.376
No.

14:59.420 --> 15:00.769
So how am I supposed to duel

15:00.812 --> 15:02.902
one of the most accomplished
outlaws in the West?

15:02.945 --> 15:05.339
Because you are
in the body of--

15:05.382 --> 15:07.645
I am in the body
of an old man,

15:07.689 --> 15:10.257
long past his prime days
as a gunslinger.

15:10.300 --> 15:12.346
Can we just try?

15:12.389 --> 15:15.088
Can we just try
to shoot the cans?

15:15.131 --> 15:17.046
Pacifists can shoot cans.

15:17.090 --> 15:18.134
I checked.

15:22.138 --> 15:23.705
Quid pro quo.

15:25.098 --> 15:26.751
What?

15:26.795 --> 15:30.581
You give me something I want,
I give you something you want.

15:32.018 --> 15:34.455
OK, I'll bite.

15:35.630 --> 15:37.501
Tell me about our first date.

15:41.201 --> 15:44.421
We'd been friends for
a few years, work friends.

15:44.465 --> 15:45.945
We'd always been
seeing other people.

15:45.988 --> 15:48.773
I mean, nothing serious,
but, I don't know,

15:48.817 --> 15:51.080
it just never lined up.

15:51.124 --> 15:53.778
And then one day,

15:53.822 --> 15:55.650
we were both kind of single,

15:55.693 --> 15:59.001
and, uh, you asked me
out for Chinese food.

16:00.394 --> 16:03.484
I don't know, something
was suddenly different,

16:03.527 --> 16:05.703
the way you looked at me.

16:05.747 --> 16:10.012
We shut that place down
and then went back to yours,

16:10.056 --> 16:12.580
and I never left.

16:12.623 --> 16:16.888
We've been kind of inseparable
ever since.

16:16.932 --> 16:20.240
Do you remember any of that?

16:20.283 --> 16:23.547
I, uh, I'm sorry.

16:24.548 --> 16:26.550
I don't.

16:26.594 --> 16:28.204
Yeah.

16:29.031 --> 16:31.294
And, um--and when--

16:31.338 --> 16:33.470
No, no.

16:33.514 --> 16:34.819
Quid pro quo.

16:34.863 --> 16:36.082
I did something for you.

16:36.125 --> 16:38.301
Now you do something for me.
- OK.

16:38.345 --> 16:39.650
Shoot the cans.

16:39.694 --> 16:42.175
Hey, OK.

16:42.218 --> 16:44.133
Here we go. Here we go.

16:44.177 --> 16:46.483
Whoa! OK, uh--

16:46.527 --> 16:48.050
- What?
- That's a good start.

16:48.094 --> 16:49.443
Can I help?

16:49.486 --> 16:50.922
Please.

16:52.489 --> 16:54.578
OK.

16:54.622 --> 16:56.145
Now, uh, bring it up.

16:57.494 --> 16:58.626
Yeah.

16:58.669 --> 17:00.454
To your eye.

17:00.497 --> 17:01.846
How's this?

17:03.109 --> 17:04.240
It's good.

17:06.242 --> 17:08.418
Ready?

17:08.462 --> 17:10.681
Aim.

17:10.725 --> 17:12.901
Fire.

17:15.208 --> 17:16.557
Oh!

17:16.600 --> 17:18.559
It's-- it's not that bad.

17:18.602 --> 17:19.864
- Not that bad?
- Yes.

17:19.908 --> 17:21.257
Hey, looks like
it's been a while since you

17:21.301 --> 17:22.606
had a gun in your hand.

17:22.650 --> 17:24.304
Oh, they need me back in HQ.

17:24.347 --> 17:25.348
I'll be right back.

17:25.392 --> 17:28.003
Uh, been a minute.

17:28.047 --> 17:30.484
I'm Henry, the one deputy

17:30.527 --> 17:32.964
that didn't take
McDonough's bribe.

17:33.008 --> 17:34.053
May I?

17:34.096 --> 17:35.880
Go for it.

17:45.760 --> 17:47.457
You can sit down,
Captain, if you like.

17:47.501 --> 17:48.719
This isn't a formal inquiry.

17:48.763 --> 17:50.504
Just a friendly check-in.

17:50.547 --> 17:52.593
Yes, ma'am.

17:52.636 --> 17:54.160
OK.

17:54.203 --> 17:56.858
Well, this is a
thrilling experience for you.

17:56.901 --> 17:59.121
First woman selected
to travel through time,

17:59.165 --> 18:02.124
working side by side
with your fiancé.

18:02.168 --> 18:03.691
Truly incredible.

18:03.734 --> 18:04.996
Yes, ma'am.

18:05.040 --> 18:06.563
How are things
going around here?

18:06.607 --> 18:07.564
Testing going well?

18:07.608 --> 18:09.305
Yes, ma'am.

18:09.349 --> 18:10.828
Excited by the progress?

18:10.872 --> 18:12.134
Yes, ma'am.

18:12.178 --> 18:13.831
You don't have to just
answer with "yes, ma'am."

18:13.875 --> 18:16.356
Permission to speak freely
and add any color

18:16.399 --> 18:17.792
you think might be helpful.

18:17.835 --> 18:19.098
Yes, ma'am.

18:20.273 --> 18:21.317
How's your fiancé?

18:21.361 --> 18:22.623
When was the last time
you saw him?

18:22.666 --> 18:24.103
Yesterday.

18:24.146 --> 18:26.235
Uh, unfortunately,
he is dealing

18:26.279 --> 18:27.758
with a private family matter today.

18:27.802 --> 18:29.847
Hmm, I heard.

18:29.891 --> 18:32.198
Captain, is there anything
going on here

18:32.241 --> 18:34.461
that I should know about?

18:34.504 --> 18:35.897
both: No, ma'am.

18:35.940 --> 18:37.942
How'd I guess?

18:37.986 --> 18:40.684
OK, well, thank you, Captain.

18:40.728 --> 18:42.208
Great seeing you.

18:42.251 --> 18:44.601
This has been
deeply illuminating.

18:44.645 --> 18:46.125
Yes, ma'am.

18:48.866 --> 18:51.521
Now look, it's just
like riding a horse.

18:51.565 --> 18:53.175
All you gotta do
is get back on.

18:53.219 --> 18:55.177
I actually don't remember
the last time I rode a horse.

18:55.221 --> 18:57.571
Come on now.
You can do this.

18:57.614 --> 19:00.878
You just got to set your sights
and pull that trigger, OK?

19:00.922 --> 19:03.229
Hey, and don't forget
to breathe.

19:15.763 --> 19:16.894
OK, OK, OK!

19:16.938 --> 19:18.287
Oh, that's OK.

19:18.331 --> 19:19.984
You're still a little rusty,
all right?

19:20.028 --> 19:21.290
Ain't nothing you can't
work out with some practice.

19:21.334 --> 19:23.684
Trust me,
this is not happening.

19:23.727 --> 19:24.815
OK?

19:24.859 --> 19:26.600
Everyone has this idea of me

19:26.643 --> 19:28.819
as being
this storied gunslinger.

19:28.863 --> 19:30.299
They've got me all wrong.

19:30.343 --> 19:32.649
The person they see,
that's not who I am.

19:32.693 --> 19:33.998
I know what that's like.

19:34.042 --> 19:36.000
Where I was born,
I spent most of my life

19:36.044 --> 19:38.177
letting folks see
me as someone I wasn't,

19:38.220 --> 19:39.700
until one day
I decided I didn't want

19:39.743 --> 19:41.180
to do that no more.

19:41.223 --> 19:43.834
I want it to be seen
for who I really am.

19:45.140 --> 19:47.664
That's when I heard
about this place,

19:47.708 --> 19:51.190
where people like me could go
and be whoever they wanted,

19:51.233 --> 19:54.323
their true selves, Salvation.

19:54.367 --> 19:56.760
So I picked up sticks
and made the change that

19:56.804 --> 19:59.067
I needed to make
and I came here.

20:00.286 --> 20:02.897
This town really
was my salvation.

20:04.507 --> 20:07.423
And I will defend it
until my very last breath.

20:10.296 --> 20:13.516
Then I'd better give
this one more shot.

20:15.649 --> 20:16.693
OK.

20:23.526 --> 20:25.049
Ahh!

20:25.093 --> 20:26.616
I hate guns!

20:26.660 --> 20:28.488
Ah, all right.

20:28.531 --> 20:29.967
Let me see that.

20:31.360 --> 20:33.057
- Oh.
- OK.

20:33.101 --> 20:35.146
You got a doctor
in this town?

20:35.190 --> 20:37.148
- Well, that depends.
- On what?

20:37.192 --> 20:39.194
On your definition
of the word "doctor."

20:41.718 --> 20:43.285
Ah, that stings!

20:43.329 --> 20:44.504
What is that?

20:44.547 --> 20:46.854
Ancient Chinese secret.

20:46.897 --> 20:48.508
Kidding. It's just aloe.

20:48.551 --> 20:51.467
The bullet left a nasty burn,
but it's just a graze.

20:51.511 --> 20:53.208
This will heal it right up.

20:53.252 --> 20:54.253
Ah.

20:54.296 --> 20:55.819
So you're, uh, really gonna

20:55.863 --> 20:57.821
take on the McDonough gang, huh?

20:57.865 --> 21:01.085
We're evaluating
multiple scenarios.

21:06.830 --> 21:09.137
- You speak Cantonese?
- I guess so.

21:09.180 --> 21:10.660
Too bad he can't hear you.

21:10.704 --> 21:12.183
My father lost his hearing

21:12.227 --> 21:13.924
doing demolition
for the railroad.

21:15.709 --> 21:16.971
Thank you.

21:23.238 --> 21:26.110
Mmm.
I forgot how hungry I was.

21:26.154 --> 21:28.112
Please tell your father
that this is the best

21:28.156 --> 21:29.636
wonton soup I've ever had.

21:29.679 --> 21:31.290
He'll appreciate that.

21:31.333 --> 21:32.682
Ever since we came
to Salvation,

21:32.726 --> 21:34.902
all he's wanted to do
is open his own restaurant.

21:34.945 --> 21:39.602
Well, then consider me
your first customer.

21:41.909 --> 21:44.390
Valentina is like family
to all of us.

21:44.433 --> 21:45.826
The people in this town
would follow her

21:45.869 --> 21:47.349
into hell if she asked.

21:49.177 --> 21:51.353
That sounded like it came
from the forge.

21:57.011 --> 21:58.447
We need more water!

21:59.666 --> 22:02.451
My forge!

22:12.287 --> 22:13.767
One second, I'm in there
fixing a wagon wheel.

22:13.810 --> 22:16.422
The next, a stick of dynamite
comes flying in.

22:16.465 --> 22:18.075
Boom.
- McDonough.

22:18.119 --> 22:20.469
The shop's all I had
in the world.

22:20.513 --> 22:23.603
Now, what am I gonna do?

22:25.082 --> 22:27.041
I got nowhere else to go.

22:28.390 --> 22:30.349
You'll rebuild.

22:31.611 --> 22:33.961
And we're all gonna help.

22:34.004 --> 22:36.355
I mean, that's what we do
in Salvation.

22:36.398 --> 22:38.269
We stick together.

22:38.313 --> 22:40.359
Some of us, anyway.

22:40.402 --> 22:42.012
Looks like McDonough's
plan worked.

22:42.056 --> 22:43.405
He's scaring people off.

22:43.449 --> 22:45.146
Yeah, well, he's not
gonna scare us.

22:45.189 --> 22:46.582
This fight isn't over.

22:46.626 --> 22:48.584
Right, <i>abuelo?</i>

22:51.979 --> 22:55.939
Look, I know you all
want me to fight,

22:55.983 --> 22:58.899
but I think there might
be a better way.

22:58.942 --> 23:01.205
What is it?

23:01.249 --> 23:02.772
Just give it a little time.

23:02.816 --> 23:04.426
- We don't have much time.
- You're a coward.

23:04.470 --> 23:05.688
Valentina!

23:05.732 --> 23:07.386
When I saw you come
to this town,

23:07.429 --> 23:08.822
it's like I'd seen a ghost.

23:08.865 --> 23:11.477
To have <i>mi sangre, mi familia</i>

23:11.520 --> 23:14.175
standing beside me,

23:14.218 --> 23:15.742
it touched my heart.

23:15.785 --> 23:18.571
Now that you've seen
what Papa has built,

23:18.614 --> 23:22.052
to see how much this
means to me, to us,

23:22.096 --> 23:24.664
and to not even fight?

23:24.707 --> 23:28.711
Papa said you were
a washed-up, wasted drunk.

23:28.755 --> 23:32.062
I hoped you were more,
but he was right.

23:34.282 --> 23:36.589
You mean nothing to me.

23:44.423 --> 23:46.990
You need to fight him,

23:47.034 --> 23:49.471
for her, for us.

23:49.515 --> 23:51.038
Please.

23:57.610 --> 23:59.655
As a member
of the Oversight Committee,

23:59.699 --> 24:02.092
I have full access to this
program's personnel files.

24:02.136 --> 24:04.617
And I must say,
I am particularly

24:04.660 --> 24:06.096
fascinated by yours, Ms. Chou.

24:06.140 --> 24:07.489
Let me guess.

24:07.533 --> 24:09.186
You're wondering how
a former cyber-criminal goes

24:09.230 --> 24:11.493
from hacking Bitcoin accounts
on the dark web

24:11.537 --> 24:13.626
to being chief of security
of a top secret,

24:13.669 --> 24:15.192
multibillion dollar,

24:15.236 --> 24:17.107
government-sanctioned
time travel project?

24:17.151 --> 24:19.283
Oh, I'm aware of how
Admiral Williams lobbied

24:19.327 --> 24:20.720
for your release from prison.

24:20.763 --> 24:22.025
Magic knew what I could
bring to the table.

24:22.069 --> 24:23.462
More than that,
he knew he could

24:23.505 --> 24:24.463
trust me with his secrets.

24:24.506 --> 24:25.768
Perhaps.

24:25.812 --> 24:27.291
But any secrets
pertaining to this project

24:27.335 --> 24:29.772
are the purview
of the Oversight Committee,

24:29.816 --> 24:31.818
everything
from day-to-day operations

24:31.861 --> 24:35.299
to breaches in protocol,
which, as chief of security,

24:35.343 --> 24:38.520
you are duty-bound to report
per the terms of your release.

24:38.564 --> 24:40.130
Bearing that in mind,
have there been

24:40.174 --> 24:43.003
any incidents in recent weeks
you'd care to share now?

24:43.046 --> 24:44.961
I'd actually need
written authorization

24:45.005 --> 24:46.876
from the Pentagon
to be able to discuss

24:46.920 --> 24:48.878
the program
with anybody who does not

24:48.922 --> 24:50.619
have day-to-day clearance.

24:50.663 --> 24:52.142
I have day-to-day clearance.

24:52.186 --> 24:54.144
Yes, but do you have it
in writing?

24:55.972 --> 24:58.540
See, as you mentioned,
I'm a former felon.

24:58.584 --> 25:00.586
I learned my lesson.

25:00.629 --> 25:02.283
I'm by the book now.

25:02.326 --> 25:04.590
I think that about does it.

25:07.027 --> 25:08.811
Drinking straight
from the bottle.

25:08.855 --> 25:10.726
That's not
a very Ben Song move.

25:10.770 --> 25:12.989
It's been a day.

25:13.033 --> 25:15.122
A long day.

25:15.165 --> 25:17.994
I realize I haven't slept
since I leapt.

25:18.038 --> 25:20.301
Yeah, well, the hosts
you've jumped into have,

25:20.344 --> 25:21.650
if that's any consolation.

25:21.694 --> 25:23.783
I know why I'm here.
I get it.

25:23.826 --> 25:26.525
This town deserves to be saved.

25:26.568 --> 25:27.656
It's special.

25:27.700 --> 25:30.267
And the people, they need it.

25:30.311 --> 25:34.837
I just can't be who
they need me to be, and...

25:34.881 --> 25:36.883
I've been feeling
that a lot lately.

25:37.840 --> 25:39.320
What's that supposed to mean?

25:39.363 --> 25:42.018
I saw the way you looked at
me when I told you

25:42.062 --> 25:43.498
I didn't remember
our first date.

25:43.542 --> 25:45.848
Look, come on, Ben,
it's just--

25:45.892 --> 25:49.112
I want
to remember everything.

25:49.156 --> 25:51.854
I want us to go back
to the way things were.

25:51.898 --> 25:53.813
And the fact that I can't--

26:01.821 --> 26:03.605
Why would I do this to us?

26:07.827 --> 26:09.655
Oh, it tastes like gasoline.

26:09.698 --> 26:11.700
Yeah, it probably is.

26:11.744 --> 26:13.572
Not my body.

26:15.095 --> 26:19.926
OK, all right,
let's stop drinking

26:19.969 --> 26:21.188
and maybe stay focused.

26:21.231 --> 26:23.451
Focused on what?
My failures?

26:23.494 --> 26:24.713
The leap.

26:24.757 --> 26:26.976
Let's say I can
put aside all morality

26:27.020 --> 26:29.588
and agree to kill this man
for the sake of the town.

26:29.631 --> 26:31.328
I can't physically do it.

26:31.372 --> 26:33.287
I'm not in the body
of a prizefighter.

26:33.330 --> 26:35.289
I'm an old man who can't
shoot straight.

26:37.378 --> 26:38.771
Where are you going?

26:38.814 --> 26:41.512
I've got to go get
Valentina and pick up sticks,

26:41.556 --> 26:42.905
as they say in these parts.

26:42.949 --> 26:46.561
If I can't save Salvation,
maybe I can

26:46.605 --> 26:48.302
try to save her.

26:54.482 --> 26:56.745
Valentina!

26:56.789 --> 26:58.181
Valentina?

26:58.225 --> 26:59.792
Where could she be?

26:59.835 --> 27:01.663
There's literally nothing to
do here at night except sleep

27:01.707 --> 27:04.274
or hang out at the saloon.
- Ben.

27:04.318 --> 27:07.364
Oh, she took the guns.

27:07.408 --> 27:08.670
OK, uh, you don't think she--

27:08.714 --> 27:09.976
Oh, no.

27:10.019 --> 27:11.281
Henry!

27:11.325 --> 27:13.109
Have you seen Valentina?
- Not since the fire.

27:13.153 --> 27:14.415
Why?
- She took my guns.

27:14.458 --> 27:15.764
I think she went
after McDonough.

27:15.808 --> 27:17.113
She did.

27:18.462 --> 27:20.290
Valentina!

27:20.334 --> 27:21.770
Oh, hey.

27:21.814 --> 27:24.207
Easy. Easy.

27:24.251 --> 27:26.079
Girl's got gumption,
I'll give her that.

27:26.122 --> 27:28.559
Anyone fool enough to come up
on me and try to take a shot,

27:28.603 --> 27:30.387
I don't care what your age,

27:30.431 --> 27:32.259
that's something I ain't
likely to forgive.

27:32.302 --> 27:35.131
Please, your fight's
not with her.

27:35.175 --> 27:36.611
She tried to kill me,
old man.

27:36.655 --> 27:37.873
It most certainly is.

27:37.917 --> 27:40.963
Let's talk, you and me.

27:42.225 --> 27:43.357
Please.

27:52.932 --> 27:54.498
Don't kill her.

27:54.542 --> 27:56.500
You may not believe this,
but I don't much like

27:56.544 --> 27:58.633
killing women and children.

27:58.677 --> 28:01.375
I will, but I don't
much like it.

28:01.418 --> 28:03.029
So I've been thinking,

28:03.072 --> 28:05.335
I think I know a way
that you and me both

28:05.379 --> 28:06.772
can save a lot of lives.

28:06.815 --> 28:08.164
You--

28:09.775 --> 28:11.124
OK.

28:11.167 --> 28:13.692
I see the way this town
looks at you.

28:13.735 --> 28:15.737
They've invested
the little hope they have

28:15.781 --> 28:17.783
into a legendary gunfighter,

28:17.826 --> 28:20.002
the savior of Salvation.

28:20.046 --> 28:26.052
I gun you down,
all that hope evaporates away,

28:26.095 --> 28:27.836
and they'll abandon
this town without me

28:27.880 --> 28:30.621
having to fire another shot.

28:30.665 --> 28:32.928
So I propose a duel.

28:32.972 --> 28:36.279
You win, and my gang
leaves this town be,

28:36.323 --> 28:38.847
and you can have
Valentina back.

28:38.891 --> 28:43.547
You lose, you die,
but she lives.

28:43.591 --> 28:44.984
Tomorrow, then.

28:46.246 --> 28:47.813
High noon.

28:47.856 --> 28:49.728
I'm guessing you're
going to want these.

28:56.038 --> 28:58.737
Tomorrow, we duel.

29:05.482 --> 29:06.875
All right, good news, y'all.

29:06.919 --> 29:10.836
Diego has agreed to duel
Josiah McDonough for the town.

29:10.879 --> 29:12.011
All right!

29:12.054 --> 29:13.577
About time.

29:13.621 --> 29:15.405
Oh, thank goodness.

29:16.929 --> 29:18.104
I'm dead.

29:18.147 --> 29:19.975
That's the spirit.

29:20.019 --> 29:22.151
What are we gonna do?

29:22.195 --> 29:24.675
Look, all of these people
would die for this town.

29:24.719 --> 29:26.503
It's not all on your shoulders.

29:27.853 --> 29:30.638
Henry's good with a gun,
but the rest of them--

29:32.335 --> 29:34.903
Ming's a chemist.

29:34.947 --> 29:38.080
His dad is basically
an explosives expert.

29:38.124 --> 29:41.388
Frankie has 1,000 gallons
of 100-proof whiskey

29:41.431 --> 29:43.129
in this saloon.

29:43.172 --> 29:44.870
Old Joe, he--

29:44.913 --> 29:47.611
he's a drunk,
but he used to be a hunter.

29:47.655 --> 29:49.526
You've got a lot
of skill sets here.

29:49.570 --> 29:51.354
They're just looking
for some leadership.

29:51.398 --> 29:53.487
So you're a lousy shot,
so what?

29:54.705 --> 29:56.359
Build a better mousetrap.

30:02.975 --> 30:04.585
I can't win.

30:06.021 --> 30:07.762
I'm sorry.

30:07.806 --> 30:10.939
McDonough's in his prime,
and I'm not.

30:10.983 --> 30:12.506
I can't win.

30:14.900 --> 30:16.423
But we can.

30:18.468 --> 30:20.514
I know how important it is
to have a place

30:20.557 --> 30:25.345
where you can be
what you were meant to be.

30:25.388 --> 30:28.870
I'm starting to experience
some of that myself recently.

30:30.959 --> 30:34.267
If we can capture McDonough
and his posse alive, we--

30:35.703 --> 30:38.010
Listen, if we can
capture them alive,

30:38.053 --> 30:41.883
we collect $10,000,
which is more than enough money

30:41.927 --> 30:44.886
to pay off the railroad
and buy us some peace, right?

30:44.930 --> 30:46.279
Sure.

30:46.322 --> 30:47.889
But how in tarnation
are we going

30:47.933 --> 30:52.981
to take down one of the most
notorious outlaws in the West?

30:53.025 --> 30:58.073
This place means more
to us than it does to him.

30:58.117 --> 31:01.816
I have a plan, but it's
gonna take all of us.

31:01.860 --> 31:05.080
If we want that money,
we can't kill any of them.

31:05.124 --> 31:06.560
What are you thinking?

31:09.519 --> 31:11.521
I understand you put
a computational firewall

31:11.565 --> 31:12.696
around Ziggy the other day.

31:12.740 --> 31:15.003
Uh, yeah,
there was an anomaly

31:15.047 --> 31:16.700
in one
of the system subroutines,

31:16.744 --> 31:18.180
and the AI had to be protected.

31:18.224 --> 31:20.487
But rest assured, I have it
all under control now.

31:20.530 --> 31:21.836
Oh, good.

31:21.880 --> 31:23.185
I was afraid it
might have something

31:23.229 --> 31:24.839
to do with those power surges.

31:24.883 --> 31:27.189
No, no, no.
Not at all.

31:27.233 --> 31:29.888
You see, the subroutines
are a set

31:29.931 --> 31:31.498
of pre-programmed instructions.

31:31.541 --> 31:33.543
And any deviation
from those instructions

31:33.587 --> 31:36.329
triggers a series
of fail-safes or redundancies.

31:36.372 --> 31:38.897
I mean, it doesn't matter
if it's a run-of-the-mill bug

31:38.940 --> 31:41.203
in the system or if it's
a targeted cyberattack.

31:41.247 --> 31:45.555
We treat each and every glitch
as if it were a DDOS.

31:46.687 --> 31:48.602
A distributed denial
of service.

31:48.645 --> 31:50.430
Basically,
it's when a hacker floods

31:50.473 --> 31:52.693
a system full of malware
and junk code

31:52.736 --> 31:54.869
with the express purpose
of slowing the system down.

31:54.913 --> 31:57.002
That was a lot to follow.

31:58.133 --> 32:01.658
Almost feels like you're trying
to be intentionally opaque.

32:01.702 --> 32:03.269
I'm sorry, that's--

32:03.312 --> 32:04.792
that's just how I talk.

32:04.835 --> 32:06.794
Funny thing about
those power surges, though--

32:06.837 --> 32:08.274
the amount of terawatts
they're pulling

32:08.317 --> 32:10.885
is almost identical
to Dr. Song's calculations

32:10.929 --> 32:13.670
of the exact amount of energy
required for a person to leap.

32:13.714 --> 32:15.672
Strange coincidence,
don't you think?

32:16.891 --> 32:18.501
Yeah, I thought so too.

32:18.545 --> 32:20.199
Thank you, Dr. Wright.

32:20.242 --> 32:21.983
This has been very helpful.

32:25.595 --> 32:27.467
So I just ran into Ian,
who just finished

32:27.510 --> 32:28.859
with Congresswoman Adani.

32:28.903 --> 32:30.470
- How'd it go?
- Not great.

32:30.513 --> 32:32.080
She may not have figured
out that Ben leaped,

32:32.124 --> 32:33.908
but she's definitely starting
to put the pieces together.

32:33.952 --> 32:35.997
But I think I have something

32:36.041 --> 32:38.086
we can use in our defense.
- What is it?

32:38.130 --> 32:40.088
Information I'm sure
she doesn't want you

32:40.132 --> 32:41.655
or anyone else to see.

32:41.698 --> 32:43.004
- Where did you get this?
- Does it matter?

32:43.048 --> 32:44.353
I verified it.

32:44.397 --> 32:46.877
If this got out,
it could destroy her career.

32:46.921 --> 32:48.879
It's why I'm giving it
to you,

32:48.923 --> 32:51.752
in case you find yourself
in need of a nuclear option.

32:53.188 --> 32:54.798
I'm hoping it won't
come to that.

32:54.842 --> 32:56.800
But if it does,
how far are you willing to go

32:56.844 --> 32:58.672
to save Quantum Leap?

33:42.542 --> 33:44.152
All right, steady.

33:44.196 --> 33:45.240
Is that all right?

33:47.112 --> 33:48.548
Good to go here.

33:48.591 --> 33:49.897
Me and the girls will
get into position.

33:49.940 --> 33:51.986
I love it when a plan
comes together.

33:52.030 --> 33:54.554
You sure this
is going to work?

33:54.597 --> 33:56.512
A little 21st century
know-how goes

33:56.556 --> 33:58.079
a long way in the 19th century.

33:58.123 --> 34:01.039
Yeah, but, uh,
what if it doesn't?

34:01.082 --> 34:02.866
I mean, there's literally a man
coming here to kill you, Ben.

34:02.910 --> 34:04.390
So if any of this
goes sideways--

34:04.433 --> 34:05.913
It won't.

34:05.956 --> 34:07.697
I already lost you once.

34:08.785 --> 34:10.526
And the thought
of losing you again,

34:10.570 --> 34:14.530
forever this time...

34:14.574 --> 34:16.184
just when I was starting
to get you back.

34:18.795 --> 34:20.232
It's time.

34:30.981 --> 34:32.287
Where the hell is everybody?

34:32.331 --> 34:33.941
Looks like your
old <i>abuelo</i> done

34:33.984 --> 34:35.725
chickened out, little lady.

34:40.165 --> 34:41.775
Looks can be deceiving.

34:41.818 --> 34:44.430
You should have left when
you had the chance, amigo.

34:44.473 --> 34:47.128
I'm giving you
one last chance.

34:47.172 --> 34:48.390
For what?

34:48.434 --> 34:50.218
Turn yourself in.

34:50.262 --> 34:52.786
Let us take you, peaceful-like.

34:54.831 --> 34:55.832
Nah.

34:57.269 --> 35:00.098
How about we get our duel
out of the way?

35:00.141 --> 35:01.664
Change of plans.

35:01.708 --> 35:03.797
Now, Henry!

35:08.323 --> 35:10.020
Ah, son of a bitch!

35:10.064 --> 35:11.457
It's an ambush!

35:22.685 --> 35:24.426
Sounds like the whole damn
town's shooting at us.

35:24.470 --> 35:25.775
Take cover!
Come on!

35:28.778 --> 35:31.216
Ahh!

35:31.259 --> 35:34.044
Sucker!

35:51.279 --> 35:53.194
What the--

35:54.674 --> 35:56.197
That's for burning my shop.

35:57.546 --> 35:59.722
I'd think twice about
that if I were you.

35:59.766 --> 36:03.248
I won't shoot you,
but the new sheriff might.

36:10.385 --> 36:11.952
Maybe we can work
something out here.

36:11.995 --> 36:13.345
Too late.

36:13.388 --> 36:15.173
Telegraph went out
this morning.

36:15.216 --> 36:18.176
And these here fine folks have
already claimed their reward.

36:18.219 --> 36:19.612
Marshals will be here
to haul you

36:19.655 --> 36:21.875
and your boys in come sun up.

36:21.918 --> 36:25.618
Should have left while
you had the chance, huh?

36:25.661 --> 36:27.054
Amigo.

36:28.186 --> 36:29.274
Ben!

36:33.234 --> 36:34.801
You did it.

36:34.844 --> 36:35.932
You saved the town.

36:35.976 --> 36:37.238
None of this
would have happened

36:37.282 --> 36:39.022
without you and your papa.

36:39.066 --> 36:40.285
You saved the town.

36:49.555 --> 36:51.426
There was no
off-site emergency.

36:51.470 --> 36:52.949
The power surges
weren't random.

36:52.993 --> 36:54.821
And the reason why
Dr. Song is not here

36:54.864 --> 36:57.519
is because you all have
used the quantum accelerator

36:57.563 --> 36:58.955
to perform
an unauthorized leap,

36:58.999 --> 37:01.262
which you've been covering up
this whole time.

37:01.306 --> 37:05.135
Well, if you knew this whole
time, why didn't you say so?

37:05.179 --> 37:06.702
I wasn't sure.

37:06.746 --> 37:09.314
But after talking
to everyone...

37:10.880 --> 37:13.492
I genuinely do believe
in Project Quantum Leap,

37:13.535 --> 37:15.363
and I tried to give you
a chance to come clean,

37:15.407 --> 37:17.017
but I'm afraid
it's too late for that.

37:17.060 --> 37:19.454
Now that I know that the
program has been compromised,

37:19.498 --> 37:21.064
you leave me no choice
but to pass this

37:21.108 --> 37:22.370
up the chain of command.

37:22.414 --> 37:24.067
You can't let them
shut us down,

37:24.111 --> 37:25.939
not until we bring Ben back.

37:25.982 --> 37:28.376
That is for the committee
to decide.

37:31.466 --> 37:34.121
10 years ago,
you and your brother

37:34.164 --> 37:37.037
took a joy ride
after a night of drinking.

37:37.080 --> 37:38.691
There was an accident.

37:39.996 --> 37:41.433
Your brother was killed.

37:41.476 --> 37:46.307
Everyone believed
he was behind the wheel,

37:46.351 --> 37:49.484
but he wasn't, was he,
Congresswoman?

37:49.528 --> 37:51.094
Are you blackmailing me,
Admiral?

37:51.138 --> 37:54.228
No, that's not my style.

37:54.272 --> 37:55.447
Then why are you
bringing this up?

37:55.490 --> 37:57.971
Quantum Leap
technology works.

37:58.014 --> 38:02.497
We can go back in time
and change the past,

38:02.541 --> 38:04.282
change it for the better.

38:04.325 --> 38:08.068
What if Ben could
jump back 10 years

38:08.111 --> 38:11.027
and make sure you two
never get into that car?

38:11.071 --> 38:12.899
We can save your brother.

38:12.942 --> 38:15.510
We just need time
to figure out how.

38:15.554 --> 38:19.209
But if you shut us down,
I can't help you.

38:21.342 --> 38:22.822
What'll it be?

38:28.828 --> 38:30.395
I will definitely be there.

38:30.438 --> 38:31.700
That's great.

38:33.049 --> 38:35.225
Thank you for your
hospitality, Magic.

38:35.269 --> 38:37.750
Good luck
with your alpha tests.

38:37.793 --> 38:39.534
Safe travels back to DC.

38:39.578 --> 38:42.015
I will keep you updated
on our progress.

38:42.058 --> 38:43.451
Thank you.

38:48.717 --> 38:50.415
Please tell me she's not
going to shut us down,

38:50.458 --> 38:53.374
leaving Ben stranded.
- No, not yet.

38:53.418 --> 38:55.028
So you used
the nuclear option?

38:55.071 --> 38:56.595
Not exactly.

38:56.638 --> 38:59.380
I told her we could go back
and save her brother's life.

38:59.424 --> 39:01.208
Magic, we can't do that.

39:01.251 --> 39:03.384
I mean, the technology,
it doesn't support us leaping

39:03.428 --> 39:04.516
to a specific moment in ti--

39:04.559 --> 39:06.953
I know that, but she doesn't.

39:06.996 --> 39:09.869
I bought us time,
bought you time.

39:09.912 --> 39:11.131
Now use it.

39:11.174 --> 39:13.699
Figure out how
to get Ben back here.

39:23.099 --> 39:27.365
A toast to <i>mi abuelo,</i>
Diego de la Cruz,

39:27.408 --> 39:29.192
the savior of Salvation.

39:31.934 --> 39:36.548
I don't want to be negative,
but at some point,

39:36.591 --> 39:38.288
railroad's gonna come
knocking again.

39:38.332 --> 39:40.726
And that reward money
will only last us for so long.

39:40.769 --> 39:43.250
Well, he's not wrong,
but this might help.

39:43.293 --> 39:45.252
Apparently, there's
a copper deposit a few miles

39:45.295 --> 39:46.819
due west of here.

39:46.862 --> 39:48.516
Might come in real handy
for that new invention,

39:48.560 --> 39:49.996
the, uh, telephone.

39:50.039 --> 39:51.432
That's a good one.

39:55.349 --> 39:57.612
So, uh, I happen
to know there's

39:57.656 --> 40:00.572
a pretty good copper vein
a couple of miles west.

40:00.615 --> 40:02.051
Folks might want
to stake that claim

40:02.095 --> 40:04.097
before the telephone companies do.

40:04.140 --> 40:05.577
You think those
newfangled talk boxes

40:05.620 --> 40:06.926
are gonna be a thing?

40:06.969 --> 40:07.796
Oh, yeah.

40:07.840 --> 40:09.450
Yeah, I'm sure of it.

40:13.454 --> 40:16.022
Will that save the town?

40:16.065 --> 40:18.154
Well, let's see.

40:18.198 --> 40:19.678
More than that.

40:19.721 --> 40:23.246
Their newfound success
puts Salvation on the map.

40:23.290 --> 40:26.728
It looks like your little
gamble paid off, cowboy.

40:26.772 --> 40:29.905
Couldn't have done it
without you, partner.

40:32.821 --> 40:34.997
Look, it's kind of like
our first date.

40:35.041 --> 40:36.259
Totally, yeah.

40:36.303 --> 40:37.609
This feels exactly the same.

40:40.742 --> 40:44.485
I may not remember
the specifics,

40:44.529 --> 40:46.792
but I remember how I feel

40:46.835 --> 40:49.272
and how much I care about you, Addison,

40:49.316 --> 40:50.665
and that I'll do anything

40:50.709 --> 40:54.582
to find my way back to you
so we can start over,

40:54.626 --> 40:57.672
build new memories, together.

40:59.674 --> 41:02.808
There's nothing I want
more than that, Ben.

41:02.851 --> 41:04.679
Is it possible
to kiss a hologram?

41:04.723 --> 41:07.421
Because I really
want to right now.

41:07.465 --> 41:08.770
Oh!

41:08.814 --> 41:10.076
You made a serious miscalculation

41:10.119 --> 41:11.338
coming here, Ben.

41:11.381 --> 41:12.644
Did he just call you, Ben?

41:12.687 --> 41:13.906
How did you know my name?

41:13.949 --> 41:15.821
I know everything
about you, Dr. Ben Song,

41:15.864 --> 41:17.605
from the year 2022.

41:17.649 --> 41:19.215
I know what you're doing.

41:19.259 --> 41:22.392
But if you value your life,
you need to stop following me.

41:22.436 --> 41:24.090
Do you understand?
