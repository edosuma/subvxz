Subtitles by demonseye

02:30.776 --> 02:31.613
Yeah !

02:32.986 --> 02:34.403
Stay! Stay!

02:34.571 --> 02:36.322
- Stay!
- I got it!

03:34.381 --> 03:36.048
Good morning, gentlemen,

03:36.133 --> 03:39.051
and welcome to another season
of Indians baseball.

03:42.472 --> 03:46.475
I know it may not seem the same
without... Donald here,

03:47.311 --> 03:49.186
but I promise you,
by the end of this season,

03:49.271 --> 03:51.606
we will have made history.

03:51.940 --> 03:55.290
Unfortunately, there are
some in the press who feel that

03:55.290 --> 03:59.655
"the... ex-showgirl wife
of Donald Phelps

03:59.740 --> 04:03.868
"has no business being the owner
of a major league baseball team."

04:04.828 --> 04:07.330
Spring training begins
in two weeks.

04:07.831 --> 04:11.213
Here's a list of the players
we'll be inviting to camp.

04:15.088 --> 04:16.813
I never heard
of half of these guys,

04:16.813 --> 04:20.009
and, uh, the ones I do know
are way past their prime.

04:20.093 --> 04:21.928
Most of these guys
never had a prime.

04:22.012 --> 04:25.556
The facts are we lost
our two best players to free agency.

04:25.724 --> 04:27.516
We haven't won a pennant
in over 35 years.

04:27.601 --> 04:31.020
We haven't placed higher
than fourth in the last 15.

04:31.104 --> 04:33.481
Obviously, it's time
for some changes.

04:33.565 --> 04:37.526
- This guy here is dead.
- Cross him off, then.

04:37.611 --> 04:40.154
Spring training starts
on the 1st.

04:40.238 --> 04:42.952
How do you think the Indians
will do this year?

04:43.283 --> 04:45.247
It doesn't look too good.

04:45.702 --> 04:48.403
These guys don't look
too fucking good.

04:54.294 --> 04:57.129
Oh, hi, Charlie.
Come in, have a seat.

04:57.214 --> 04:58.798
I'm glad
you called me in.

04:58.882 --> 05:01.884
I'm, uh, still unclear
about a couple of things.

05:01.969 --> 05:03.302
Oh, really? Like what?

05:03.387 --> 05:06.514
Well, if I'm the GM,
who's gonna be the manager?

05:06.598 --> 05:09.767
I was thinking
of Lou Brown.

05:10.394 --> 05:11.727
Who's Lou Brown?

05:11.812 --> 05:14.105
He's managed the Toledo Mud Hens
of the International League

05:14.189 --> 05:15.982
for the last 30 years.

05:16.066 --> 05:18.985
I think he'll fit right in
with our team concept.

05:19.069 --> 05:21.654
What exactly
is our team concept?

05:21.738 --> 05:24.031
That's what I wanted
to talk to you about, Charlie.

05:24.116 --> 05:28.035
I wanna put together a team
that'll help us relocate to Miami.

05:28.120 --> 05:29.305
What do you mean?

05:29.496 --> 05:31.288
Some of these guys
are furniture movers?

05:31.373 --> 05:33.958
I'm serious
about this, Charlie.

05:34.042 --> 05:36.708
It's no secret
I've never liked Cleveland much.

05:37.796 --> 05:40.103
The stadium's falling apart,
we don't draw dick,

05:40.103 --> 05:42.330
the weather's lousy.
Another couple years of this,

05:42.330 --> 05:45.970
and I'm gonna have to start
feeding Cha-Cha real dog food.

05:46.054 --> 05:49.682
Mrs. Phelps, you just can't
up and move a team on a whim.

05:49.766 --> 05:51.517
It's hardly a whim.

05:52.686 --> 05:55.479
Miami's offered
to build us a new stadium.

05:55.689 --> 05:59.919
62,000 capacity,
45 VIP boxes,

05:59.971 --> 06:02.069
and for me,
a mansion in Boca Raton,

06:02.154 --> 06:03.480
plus free membership

06:03.480 --> 06:06.056
in the Palm Beach
Polo and Country Club.

06:06.783 --> 06:09.744
Now, no other franchise in baseball
can match that deal.

06:09.828 --> 06:11.370
The league will never let us
leave Cleveland.

06:11.455 --> 06:13.111
We got a lease with the city.

06:13.206 --> 06:14.874
The lease says
we have the right to move

06:14.958 --> 06:17.251
if the attendance falls
below 800,000 for the year.

06:17.335 --> 06:19.253
Paragraph 40, line 17.

06:19.337 --> 06:22.548
If we play bad enough, we should
be able to come in under that.

06:22.632 --> 06:24.925
What are you saying?
You want us to lose?

06:25.010 --> 06:27.303
No. We've been losing.

06:28.221 --> 06:31.807
What I want is for us
to finish dead last.

06:55.123 --> 06:56.707
- Yeah?
- Hello, Jake?

06:56.792 --> 06:59.928
This is Charlie Donovan,
the new GM of the Cleveland Indians.

07:00.879 --> 07:01.923
Yeah.

07:02.214 --> 07:03.881
We'd love for you
to come to spring training

07:03.965 --> 07:05.424
for a shot
at this year's club.

07:05.509 --> 07:08.052
- Is that you, Talbert?
- What?

07:08.136 --> 07:10.846
<i>This isn't very funny, you know.
I'm hung over,</i>

07:10.931 --> 07:13.140
my knees are killing me,
and if you're gonna pull this shit,

07:13.225 --> 07:15.768
at least you could have said
you were from the Yankees.

07:18.522 --> 07:19.522
Tire World.

07:19.606 --> 07:22.858
<i>Hello, Lou? This is Charlie Donovan
of the Cleveland lndians.</i>

07:22.943 --> 07:25.602
How would you like to manage
the Indians this year?

07:25.821 --> 07:27.530
I don't know.

07:28.115 --> 07:29.615
What do you mean,
you don't know?

07:29.699 --> 07:31.826
This is a chance to manage
in the big leagues.

07:31.910 --> 07:33.494
Let me think it over,
will you, Charlie?

07:33.578 --> 07:36.288
I got a guy on the other line
about some whitewalls.

07:36.373 --> 07:38.040
I'll talk to you later.

07:38.125 --> 07:40.876
Rick, we heard about your pitching
out of Portland last year.

07:41.002 --> 07:42.920
I'm not really with them anymore.

07:43.004 --> 07:44.713
Well, we'd still like
to take a look at you

07:44.798 --> 07:47.424
at our spring camp in Arizona,
March the 1st.

07:47.509 --> 07:50.219
Well, I'm not sure
I can make it by then.

08:21.668 --> 08:23.221
There's Jake Taylor.

08:24.087 --> 08:25.671
He was an all-star at Boston,
wasn't he?

08:25.755 --> 08:27.965
Yeah, wound up
in the Mexican League.

08:28.049 --> 08:30.050
Had some problems
with his knees.

08:30.135 --> 08:33.220
- Wish we had him two years ago.
- We did.

08:33.304 --> 08:35.181
Four years ago, then.

08:41.770 --> 08:43.397
Who is that?

08:43.481 --> 08:45.498
Must be Cerrano.

08:45.525 --> 08:48.319
Defected from Cuba.
Wanted religious freedom.

08:48.403 --> 08:50.279
What's his religion?

08:51.948 --> 08:53.282
Voodoo.

09:03.960 --> 09:06.295
I thought you didn't have
any high-priced talent.

09:06.463 --> 09:08.631
Forgot about Dorn,
cause he's only high-priced.

09:08.715 --> 09:10.799
Picked him up as a free agent
three years ago.

09:10.884 --> 09:12.760
Still hits the ball pretty well,
doesn't he?

09:12.844 --> 09:15.054
Yeah. He just can't field it.

09:17.682 --> 09:19.678
We'll shape him up.

09:19.684 --> 09:21.268
Hey.

09:25.190 --> 09:27.316
I don't recognize this guy.

09:29.694 --> 09:33.113
Say, hey.
Willie Mays Hayes here.

09:33.198 --> 09:35.616
Play like Mays,
but I run like Hayes.

09:35.700 --> 09:36.744
How you doin'?

09:37.622 --> 09:38.897
How you doin'?

09:40.455 --> 09:43.332
- My man.
- Lou Brown. Nice to meet you, Hayes.

09:43.416 --> 09:46.168
The parking lot
is right out there.

09:48.505 --> 09:49.713
Thanks.

09:50.507 --> 09:53.002
Oh, and don't you guys
go anywhere.

09:53.343 --> 09:55.592
I plan to put on
a hitting display.

09:58.265 --> 10:00.902
I don't remember
a Hayes on the list.

10:18.201 --> 10:20.661
Look at
this fucking guy.

10:25.542 --> 10:28.836
My kinda team, Charlie.
It's my kinda team.

10:32.716 --> 10:33.841
Mr. Dorn.

10:33.925 --> 10:35.926
Harris! How you doin'?

10:36.011 --> 10:37.970
Hey, that weave 
s looking good, huh?

10:38.054 --> 10:40.639
It's better than
that rug of yours.

10:40.724 --> 10:42.474
Whoa! Another freak show
candidate.

10:42.559 --> 10:45.006
How do you cut your hair, rook?
Vegematic?

10:45.562 --> 10:49.940
The earring's cute, too. Have you got
the, uh, matching bracelet, veg-head?

10:51.401 --> 10:52.735
Whoa.

10:57.907 --> 11:00.951
- Watch yourself, Rog.
- Mr. Tough Guy.

11:07.542 --> 11:09.126
Hi. Jake Taylor.

11:13.465 --> 11:16.342
So, you got a name,
or you gonna settle for "veg-head"?

11:16.426 --> 11:19.094
-Vaughn. Rick Vaughn.
-Hi, Rick.

11:19.179 --> 11:20.554
Hey, forget about Dorn.

11:20.638 --> 11:22.139
He's always a little tough
on the rookies.

11:22.223 --> 11:23.849
You get a lot worse
from other clubs.

11:23.933 --> 11:27.144
Say, hey! How you doin'?
Willie Mays Hayes here.

11:27.270 --> 11:28.937
Jake Taylor here.

11:29.022 --> 11:30.829
Uh, Rick, uh, Vaughn.

11:31.274 --> 11:32.766
What the hell league
you been playing in?

11:32.766 --> 11:34.461
California Penal.

11:34.778 --> 11:37.248
Never heard of it.
Well, how'd you end up playin' there?

11:37.489 --> 11:38.906
Stole a car.

11:43.620 --> 11:46.288
Hey, big guy.
You a golfer?

11:47.832 --> 11:50.426
Hats for bats.

11:50.960 --> 11:53.676
Yeah.
What's your handicap?

11:54.255 --> 11:55.798
Keep bats warm.

11:58.301 --> 12:00.154
Gracias.

12:01.304 --> 12:03.274
Whoa, amigo, I, uh...

12:03.807 --> 12:04.755
You can't ju...

12:07.977 --> 12:09.478
You're welcome.

12:27.872 --> 12:29.706
This is the guy that
wasn't invited to the camp.

12:29.791 --> 12:31.667
Let's take his ass out.

12:58.736 --> 13:00.863
Shit!
I been cut already?

13:08.204 --> 13:10.122
Who the hell is that?

13:29.601 --> 13:31.018
Get him a uniform.

13:31.102 --> 13:33.233
All right.
Did you get enough hay for him?

13:33.313 --> 13:36.607
You sure? Take good care
of it, all right? All right.

13:38.651 --> 13:40.986
Hey, Jake.
How's the knees holding up?

13:41.070 --> 13:42.488
Great.
Never been better.

13:42.572 --> 13:45.324
Mobility's good? No problem
gettin' off the throw to second?

13:45.408 --> 13:46.533
No problemo.

13:46.618 --> 13:47.910
I need a catcher, Jake,

13:47.994 --> 13:50.162
somebody who can lead
this team on the field.

13:50.246 --> 13:53.749
So, I want the absolute truth here.
Are you 100%?

13:53.875 --> 13:55.792
Yeah. Would I bullshit you
about somethin' like that?

13:55.877 --> 13:58.587
You better,
if you wanna make this team.

14:01.424 --> 14:02.811
Second base!

14:05.595 --> 14:06.917
Shit.

14:29.994 --> 14:31.745
Hold it. Hold it.

14:34.290 --> 14:37.918
Well, you may run like Mays,
but you hit like shit.

14:38.002 --> 14:40.546
With your speed,
you should hit the ball on the ground

14:40.630 --> 14:41.755
and be legging them out.

14:41.839 --> 14:44.550
Every time I see you
hit one in the air,

14:44.634 --> 14:46.468
you owe me 20 pushups.

14:47.470 --> 14:49.721
Hey, no problem.

15:01.150 --> 15:02.276
Shit.

15:06.322 --> 15:09.074
All right, Vaughn,
they tell us you're a pitcher.

15:09.158 --> 15:11.410
You're sure not much
of a dresser.

15:11.494 --> 15:14.454
We wear caps and sleeves
at this level, son.

15:14.956 --> 15:16.415
Understood?

15:17.667 --> 15:20.335
All right, let's see
what you can do.

15:30.847 --> 15:33.181
- Nice velocity.
- Sounded like it.

15:33.266 --> 15:34.556
Jesus.

15:35.727 --> 15:37.102
How much?

15:38.021 --> 15:39.563
96.

15:40.523 --> 15:44.359
Better teach this kid some control
before he kills somebody.

15:46.529 --> 15:49.197
Come on, Dorn.
Get in front of the damn ball.

15:49.282 --> 15:51.658
Don't give me
this ole bullshit.

15:51.743 --> 15:53.285
Look, I took one of those
in the eye last year.

15:53.369 --> 15:54.620
I'm not about
to lose my sight.

15:54.704 --> 15:57.456
I'm deeply moved. Every time
you play one off your hips,

15:57.540 --> 15:59.374
you owe me 40 sit-ups.

15:59.459 --> 16:00.578
What?

16:23.900 --> 16:25.692
Jesus.
This guy hits a ton.

16:25.777 --> 16:28.153
How come nobody else
picked up on 'im?

16:28.237 --> 16:31.707
Okay, Eddie, that's enough fastballs.
Throw him some breaking balls.

16:41.250 --> 16:43.752
Lou, I want a word
with you here.

16:45.129 --> 16:46.254
Sure.

16:50.051 --> 16:51.635
About those sit-ups
you want me to do,

16:51.719 --> 16:53.009
I got it right here
in my contract.

16:53.009 --> 16:54.548
Says I don't have to do
any calisthenics

16:54.548 --> 16:57.718
I don't feel are necessary.
So, what do you think about that?

17:12.240 --> 17:13.385
Two hundred pushups.

17:13.563 --> 17:15.673
How am I supposed to hit
if I can't lift my arms?

17:15.673 --> 17:16.673
Shit.

17:16.953 --> 17:17.993
The way I played today,

17:18.079 --> 17:20.204
I wouldn't be surprised
if they red-tagged me already.

17:20.289 --> 17:21.540
What do you mean?

17:21.624 --> 17:22.881
You get a red tag
on your locker,

17:22.881 --> 17:24.229
it means the manager
wants to see you

17:24.229 --> 17:27.107
because you just died
and went down to the minors.

17:33.970 --> 17:35.588
Hey, don't worry, kid.

17:35.888 --> 17:38.284
They ain't gonna cut anybody
the first day.

17:49.318 --> 17:51.528
What's that shit
on your chest?

17:52.405 --> 17:53.739
Crisco.

17:54.949 --> 17:56.158
Bardahl.

17:57.368 --> 17:58.368
Vagisil.

17:58.453 --> 17:59.619
Any one of 'em
will give you

17:59.704 --> 18:02.080
another 2 to 3 inches drop
on your curve ball.

18:02.165 --> 18:04.082
Course, if the umps
are watching me close,

18:04.167 --> 18:07.085
I just rub a little jalapeno
inside my nose, get it running.

18:07.170 --> 18:09.129
Then if I need to load
the ball up a little,

18:09.213 --> 18:11.131
I just... wipe my nose.

18:12.383 --> 18:14.384
You put snot...
on the ball?

18:15.178 --> 18:19.431
I haven't got an arm like yours.
I gotta put anything on it I can find.

18:19.932 --> 18:22.017
Someday you will, too.

18:45.166 --> 18:47.083
Que pasa there, Pedro?

18:48.795 --> 18:51.046
Bats, they are sick.

18:51.798 --> 18:53.465
I can no hit curve ball.

18:53.549 --> 18:55.967
Straight ball,
I hit it very much.

18:56.469 --> 18:59.137
Curve ball...
bats are afraid.

19:01.724 --> 19:05.393
I ask Jobu to come,
take fear from bats.

19:06.187 --> 19:09.356
I offer him...
cigar... and rum.

19:11.150 --> 19:12.651
He will come.

19:12.735 --> 19:14.319
Hey, you know,
you might think about

19:14.403 --> 19:16.112
taking Jesus Christ
as your savior,

19:16.197 --> 19:18.615
instead of fooling around
with all this stuff.

19:18.699 --> 19:20.459
Shit, Harris.

19:22.870 --> 19:26.289
Jesus.
I like him very much,

19:27.124 --> 19:29.584
but he no help
with curve ball.

19:29.669 --> 19:32.587
You tryin' to say
Jesus Christ can't hit a curve ball?

19:32.672 --> 19:35.590
Okay, Harris.
Let's not start a holy war here.

19:38.386 --> 19:41.513
I wouldn't leave that rum sittin' around
out here with this group.

19:44.267 --> 19:47.769
Is very bad...
to steal Jobu's rum.

19:53.317 --> 19:54.734
Is very bad.

20:01.659 --> 20:03.285
Si, si, Pedro.

20:32.398 --> 20:35.233
Attaboy, Dorn.
Way to get in front of that ball.

20:35.318 --> 20:36.717
That's the ticket.

21:03.679 --> 21:05.068
Gracias.

21:06.557 --> 21:07.807
Okay.

21:22.031 --> 21:23.406
Third base.

21:30.748 --> 21:32.843
- Shit.
- Jesus!

21:34.251 --> 21:35.710
He's safe!

21:39.882 --> 21:41.092
Damn!

21:46.305 --> 21:47.441
Jeez!

21:49.558 --> 21:51.098
He's goin'.

21:54.522 --> 21:56.940
- Come on.
- Out!

22:01.362 --> 22:04.222
- Final cut-down day, right?
- Afraid so.

22:05.157 --> 22:06.795
I don't wanna go in there.

22:07.243 --> 22:09.035
Yeah. Look, uh,
whatever happens,

22:09.120 --> 22:12.163
you just keep it to yourselves
until you get out of the clubhouse.

22:12.248 --> 22:15.481
You don't wanna celebrate
in front of guys who just died.

22:16.127 --> 22:19.421
Yeah, but what if
we're one of the deceased, huh?

22:25.720 --> 22:28.367
Come on, Jake,
it's only your life.

23:49.345 --> 23:50.512
Yes, yes, yes.

24:15.913 --> 24:18.998
I got news for you, Mr. Brown.
You haven't heard the last of me.

24:19.083 --> 24:20.500
You may think
I'm shit now,

24:20.584 --> 24:23.253
but someday,
you're gonna be sorry that you cut me.

24:23.337 --> 24:24.546
I'm gonna catch on
somewhere else,

24:24.630 --> 24:26.798
and every time
that I pitch against you,

24:26.882 --> 24:29.759
I'm gonna stick it
up your fucking ass!

24:32.096 --> 24:35.140
Good. I like that kind of spirit
in a player.

24:35.599 --> 24:38.309
The only problem is
I didn't cut you.

24:38.394 --> 24:39.394
What?

24:39.478 --> 24:42.564
I think someone's been
having some fun with you.

24:48.988 --> 24:50.029
Jesus.

24:53.826 --> 24:55.410
Hey, hey, hey!

24:57.913 --> 24:59.038
Vaughn!

25:00.624 --> 25:02.417
Come on, guys!
Cool it!

25:02.501 --> 25:04.002
- Don't fuck with me, Vaughn!
- Yeah?

25:04.086 --> 25:05.086
Fuck you!

25:05.171 --> 25:07.505
What's the matter, rookie fuckwad,
can't you take a little joke?

25:07.590 --> 25:10.133
Oh, yeah.
Real fucking funny, asshole!

25:10.217 --> 25:13.011
All right. All right!
Knock that shit off!

25:14.096 --> 25:16.347
Lou, you better make it
real clear to this little lady,

25:16.432 --> 25:18.600
I'm not about
to take his shit.

25:18.726 --> 25:20.435
Shut up, Dorn.

25:20.519 --> 25:23.104
Save all that energy
for the field.

25:23.189 --> 25:26.191
Got a long way to go
before the season's over.

25:29.445 --> 25:32.739
Hey, forget about Dorn.
We got other things to do.

25:32.948 --> 25:34.414
Like what?

25:35.576 --> 25:37.911
Like packing
for Cleveland.

25:39.788 --> 25:41.047
Come on.

25:56.597 --> 25:59.015
Ricky Vaughn? Willie Hayes?

25:59.892 --> 26:02.018
I never heard of
most of 'em.

26:03.145 --> 26:04.437
Mitchell Friedman?

26:05.648 --> 26:07.398
Who are these fucking guys?

26:26.710 --> 26:28.920
Two down.
Bottom of the ninth.

26:29.463 --> 26:31.089
Game is tied.

26:32.049 --> 26:33.925
Taylor calls his shot.

26:37.680 --> 26:39.472
There's the pitch.

27:06.583 --> 27:08.127
Yeah!

27:09.086 --> 27:12.630
Whoo! Oh, boy!
Oh, you really got a hold of that one.

27:13.007 --> 27:15.216
Yeah. What was that,
a slider?

27:16.635 --> 27:18.303
It was outta here.

27:32.192 --> 27:34.444
Are you gentlemen
ready to order?

27:34.528 --> 27:37.457
Oh, we'll need a few
minutes more, please.

27:44.747 --> 27:46.873
I look like a banker
in this.

27:47.833 --> 27:50.543
Sorry, Rick,
those are the house rules.

27:51.295 --> 27:53.379
So, what are we
gonna have?

27:53.464 --> 27:56.062
- What language is this?
- French.

27:57.092 --> 27:59.218
They got chilidogs
over there?

27:59.303 --> 28:02.221
Forget it, I'll order.
Let's have a toast.

28:05.684 --> 28:07.435
Here's to baseball,

28:07.770 --> 28:10.396
and to the start of
two great careers.

28:11.357 --> 28:12.857
And for me,

28:13.275 --> 28:16.073
here's to one more good year
in the sun.

28:37.633 --> 28:39.801
What is it? The chick?

28:40.177 --> 28:43.513
- That's my wife.
- Does she know that?

28:43.847 --> 28:45.973
I mean, uh, she would have been,
if I hadn't messed it up.

28:46.058 --> 28:47.183
Who's that guy
she's with?

28:47.267 --> 28:49.852
I don't know.
He's not wearing a name tag.

28:49.937 --> 28:53.065
You want me to drag 'im out of here,
kick the shit out of 'im?

28:58.821 --> 28:59.862
Excuse me.

28:59.947 --> 29:02.573
Miss Westland, there's
a telephone call for you at the desk.

29:02.658 --> 29:04.450
Oh, okay, thank you.

29:05.035 --> 29:07.662
That's strange.
I'll be right back.

29:13.293 --> 29:17.320
- Hello?
- Hello, Lynn? It's Jake.

29:18.090 --> 29:19.519
Jake.

29:20.342 --> 29:22.135
- Jake Taylor?
- Uh-huh.

29:24.012 --> 29:25.555
How'd you know
I was here?

29:25.639 --> 29:27.390
Oh, just a hunch.

29:28.016 --> 29:30.738
I took you there when you got
your master's degree, remember?

29:31.102 --> 29:35.231
<i>I figured you're wearing
that black dress with the, uh, red sash.</i>

29:36.316 --> 29:39.704
How'd you know that?
I didn't even have this dress when...

29:46.952 --> 29:48.957
You're still a stunner.

29:50.205 --> 29:51.890
Thanks.

29:54.376 --> 29:55.626
What are you doing here?

29:55.711 --> 29:58.004
Aren't you supposed to be
in Mexico somewhere?

29:58.088 --> 30:00.923
Well, I'm playing with the Indians again.
Back in the bigs.

30:01.008 --> 30:04.510
Well, that's great. That's-that's
great, Jake. I'm happy for you.

30:04.595 --> 30:08.181
Lynn, I don't think he's gonna buy
the phone bit now.

30:13.270 --> 30:15.188
I, uh... I gotta get back.

30:15.522 --> 30:16.898
Wait a minute.
I need your number.

30:16.982 --> 30:19.150
I tried calling you at home,
but you're not listed.

30:19.234 --> 30:21.319
My life is different
from when you knew me, Jake.

30:21.403 --> 30:23.362
Meaning what,
I don't know you anymore?

30:23.447 --> 30:24.780
Couldn't we talk about this
some other time?

30:24.865 --> 30:26.741
- I really gotta get back.
- Okay. Just give me the number.

30:26.825 --> 30:29.243
- I don't think that's a good idea.
- Why? Cause of this guy you're with?

30:29.328 --> 30:31.746
- What is he, an accountant?
- Attorney.

30:31.830 --> 30:35.124
- Oh, worse.
- Please. He's watching us.

30:35.209 --> 30:38.219
I'm not leaving
till you give me your number.

30:39.755 --> 30:43.758
All right.
It's 555-1934.

30:44.218 --> 30:45.685
Thank you.

30:46.553 --> 30:47.637
Lynn.

30:49.348 --> 30:51.807
I'm back.
I'm gonna be around.

31:35.310 --> 31:38.229
Relax, kid.
We got 162 o' these games to go.

31:44.653 --> 31:45.987
All right, everybody.

31:46.071 --> 31:49.657
We got 10 minutes to game time.
Let's all gather round.

31:54.329 --> 31:57.456
I'm not much for
giving inspirational addresses,

31:57.749 --> 32:02.003
but I'd just like to point out that
every newspaper in the country

32:02.129 --> 32:04.505
has picked us
to finish last.

32:06.174 --> 32:09.760
The local press seems to think
we'd save everyone

32:09.845 --> 32:12.138
a lot o' time and trouble

32:12.222 --> 32:15.057
if we just went out
and shot ourselves.

32:15.475 --> 32:18.394
Me? I'm for wasting
sportswriters' time.

32:18.645 --> 32:20.855
So, I'd like
to hang around

32:20.981 --> 32:24.900
and see if we can give 'em all
a nice big shit-burger to eat.

32:27.940 --> 32:29.680
Shit-burger, Skip?

32:29.865 --> 32:30.974
Hey, Lou.

32:32.993 --> 32:35.369
Aren't we gonna
have a prayer?

32:35.495 --> 32:39.206
I mean, we're not all savages
like Cerrano over there.

32:42.044 --> 32:43.794
You guys go ahead.

32:43.879 --> 32:45.880
Oh, well, okay.
Let's, uh...

32:47.257 --> 32:50.801
- Let's all bow our heads.
- Excuse me. I'll be in my office.

32:53.472 --> 32:57.099
Dear Heavenly Father,
we humbly pray that you will guide...

32:59.019 --> 33:01.187
Jesus Christ, Cerrano.

33:01.271 --> 33:03.064
Have to wake up bats.

33:03.607 --> 33:06.161
Okay. Shit,
can we try this again?

33:08.570 --> 33:13.574
Dear God, we humbly pray
that you will guide and protect us

33:13.659 --> 33:16.452
as we gird up our loins
to take the field of battle.

33:16.536 --> 33:19.747
Lead us all into victory
in the name of Jesus...

33:21.208 --> 33:22.500
Christ.

33:24.294 --> 33:26.545
- Way to go, Cerrano.
- Goddamn it.

33:26.630 --> 33:28.756
- Jesus.
- Let's go. Go.

33:34.763 --> 33:35.805
Hello again, everybody.

33:35.889 --> 33:38.933
Harry Doyle here, welcoming
all you friends of the feather

33:39.226 --> 33:41.477
to another season
of Indians baseball.

33:41.561 --> 33:44.563
A lot of new faces in Chief Wahoo's
tribe this year

33:44.648 --> 33:46.899
as they take on the defending
American League champs,

33:46.983 --> 33:48.275
the New York Yankees.

33:48.360 --> 33:50.903
And hopefully, we'll have some
of the names that go with those faces

33:50.987 --> 33:52.488
before their first at-bat.

33:52.572 --> 33:56.951
Anyway, listen to the roar of the crowd
as the Indians take the field.

34:05.043 --> 34:08.504
Yes, sir, they love this club
here in Cleveland.

34:08.880 --> 34:11.674
Just a reminder, fans,
about Die Hard Night

34:11.757 --> 34:12.967
coming up here
at the stadium.

34:13.051 --> 34:15.803
Free admission to anyone
who was actually alive

34:15.887 --> 34:18.806
the last time
the Indians won a pennant.

34:21.393 --> 34:24.103
Here's to
the thrill of defeat, Charlie.

34:25.480 --> 34:29.275
Keltner delivers. Here's a swing,
and a high fly ball to center field.

34:29.484 --> 34:30.568
Hayes under it.

34:30.652 --> 34:33.737
Hey. Makes a basket catch,
Willie Mays style.

34:33.905 --> 34:35.531
And the side is retired.

34:36.699 --> 34:39.243
All right.
Way to look out there. Great.

34:39.327 --> 34:42.663
Nice catch, Hayes.
Don't ever fucking do it again.

34:42.998 --> 34:45.750
- All right. Let's go! Let's get it goin'!
- Let's go.

34:45.958 --> 34:48.002
Bottom of the first,
and Willie Mays Hayes

34:48.085 --> 34:50.004
to lead it off
for the wigwammers.

34:50.088 --> 34:52.672
A lot of people say you can tell
how the season's gonna go

34:52.757 --> 34:54.300
by the first hitter
of the year.

34:54.384 --> 34:56.677
Brewster into the wind,
and comes to the plate.

34:57.012 --> 34:57.548
Oops!

34:57.548 --> 34:59.972
Hey! Here's a hot shot
toward the hole.

35:00.056 --> 35:03.893
Rudiya knocks it down, fires to first.
Late! Hayes beat it!

35:05.687 --> 35:09.607
Hey, give Rudiya credit for
sacrificing his body on that racket.

35:09.691 --> 35:11.442
That guy's got a family
to think about.

35:11.526 --> 35:14.361
So, Hayes becomes
the first Indian in 15 years

35:14.446 --> 35:15.863
to lead off the season
with a hit.

35:15.947 --> 35:18.157
Really knocked the crap
outta that one.

35:18.241 --> 35:20.451
Oh, I plan to get
at least a double out of this.

35:20.577 --> 35:24.079
I bought 100 of these,
one for every base I'm gonna steal.

35:24.164 --> 35:24.550
Shit.

35:24.550 --> 35:27.739
Well, maybe things will turn around
a little for the Indians this year.

35:27.739 --> 35:30.544
<i>Now batting, number seven,
catcher Jake TayIor.</i>

35:30.629 --> 35:33.881
Excuse me. Gotta take my first step
toward the Hall of Fame.

35:33.965 --> 35:34.965
My ass.

35:35.050 --> 35:37.176
We don't know where Hayes
played last year,

35:37.260 --> 35:39.386
but I'm sure he did
a hell of a job.

35:39.471 --> 35:42.807
Brewster ready from the stretch.
Hayes with a good lead.

35:42.891 --> 35:45.184
You look real sharp,
but it's hard to steal second base

35:45.268 --> 35:47.102
with your shoe untied.

35:47.187 --> 35:49.990
Quick move to first.
He got 'im!

35:49.990 --> 35:52.119
Hayes is picked off.

35:55.695 --> 35:56.862
Well, so much for that.

35:56.947 --> 35:59.667
Personally, I think we got hosed
on that call.

36:06.706 --> 36:10.084
Nice goin'.
Don't bounce the damn ball.

36:11.378 --> 36:13.254
Nice throw, dickhead.

36:15.382 --> 36:16.559
Strike.

36:16.967 --> 36:18.492
Son of a bitch!

36:18.510 --> 36:20.135
Comin' through! I...

36:20.220 --> 36:22.847
Oh, oh, shit!

36:24.516 --> 36:28.519
Top of the sixth, and rookie sensation
Ricky Vaughn on the pitch now.

36:28.603 --> 36:32.166
You can close the book
on Keltner.... Thank God.

36:32.440 --> 36:34.024
Relax, rookie.
We're only four runs down.

36:34.109 --> 36:35.192
We're still in this game.

36:35.277 --> 36:36.393
You take it to 'em.

36:36.486 --> 36:37.695
- Let's go.
- All right.

36:37.779 --> 36:40.281
Look, man, a guy gets to second,
first sign indicator.

36:40.448 --> 36:42.950
Vaughn, a juvenile delinquent
in the off-season,

36:43.034 --> 36:44.535
in his major league debut.

36:44.619 --> 36:46.913
I'm gonna light
your ass up, meat.

36:49.875 --> 36:52.543
Vaughn into the wind-up
in his first offering.

36:53.128 --> 36:56.684
Just a bit outside.
He tried the corner and missed.

36:58.049 --> 37:00.301
Ball four. Ball eight.

37:01.887 --> 37:04.346
Low, and Vaughn has walked
the bases loaded

37:04.431 --> 37:05.931
on 12 straight pitches.

37:06.016 --> 37:08.142
Boy, how can these guys
lay off pitches that close?

37:08.226 --> 37:09.226
Fuck!

37:12.314 --> 37:15.107
Wild thing

37:15.358 --> 37:17.359
You make my heart sing

37:19.154 --> 37:21.280
You walk everything

37:23.158 --> 37:24.742
Taylor, what are you doin'
back up here?

37:24.826 --> 37:27.589
I couldn't cut it
in the Mexican League.

37:28.121 --> 37:29.948
How's your wife
and my kids?

37:30.332 --> 37:33.083
Vaughn in deep trouble here
with Clue Haywood,

37:33.168 --> 37:36.587
last year's American League
home-run champ at the plate.

37:36.671 --> 37:38.422
Vaughn kicks, fires....

37:38.506 --> 37:42.551
Here is a swing and a drive
toward left field, and deep. Oh, boy.

37:42.636 --> 37:45.304
No way. No way.
Too high. Too high.

37:45.513 --> 37:48.390
It is gone
off the reservation.

37:48.475 --> 37:51.185
A grand-slam home run
for Haywood.

37:52.520 --> 37:53.604
Looked like a strike,
anyway.

37:53.688 --> 37:54.772
Where are you going?

37:54.856 --> 37:56.440
"Too high"?
What does that mean, "too high"?

37:56.524 --> 37:58.108
Too high, I thought.

37:58.193 --> 38:00.402
So, Vaughn is off
to a rocky start,

38:00.487 --> 38:03.280
as Haywood clears the bases
with one swing.

38:03.365 --> 38:05.115
Not "too high",
"too hard", right?

38:05.200 --> 38:08.202
- At first, it was really high.
- Who gives a shit? It's gone.

38:10.872 --> 38:14.166
-W ant me to go get 'im?
- Nah. Let's see how he reacts.

38:14.334 --> 38:16.835
Well, Brown, apparently,
is going to stay with Vaughn here,

38:16.920 --> 38:19.713
as the Indians trail now,
eight to nothin'.

38:19.839 --> 38:23.509
Coleman steps in.
A 281 lifetime hitter.

38:23.593 --> 38:27.179
Taylor with a sign,
Vaughn into his motion, and the pitch.

38:27.931 --> 38:28.973
Uh-oh !

38:29.057 --> 38:30.516
Interesting.

38:30.600 --> 38:31.600
About time,
it's eight-nothing.

38:31.685 --> 38:33.268
You ! You're gone!

38:33.395 --> 38:35.771
- What?
- You heard me, you're gone!

38:35.855 --> 38:37.147
He was right on top
of the plate.

38:37.232 --> 38:39.358
Get 'im outta here!
He's horse shit.

38:39.442 --> 38:41.694
I think
you can go get him now.

38:41.778 --> 38:44.071
The ball slipped out of my hand.
It was an accident.

38:44.155 --> 38:45.614
You threw at him
intentionally.

38:45.699 --> 38:47.866
- Oh, kiss my ass.
- You're gone.

38:47.951 --> 38:50.494
- You're full o' shit! Fuck you!
- Get outta here, rookie!

38:50.578 --> 38:52.329
Why don't you blow me,
ump?

38:52.414 --> 38:53.015
You're gone!

38:53.015 --> 38:55.708
All right, Coleman, take it easy.
Accidents will happen.

38:55.792 --> 38:57.626
You show a lot of heart
shaking it off like this.

38:57.711 --> 38:58.567
Fuck you, Taylor.

38:59.129 --> 39:00.879
- He done hurt him, hurt himself!
- Come on !

39:00.964 --> 39:02.965
Don't even think about it,
Coleman.

39:03.258 --> 39:05.884
The fucking wall,
you pansy!

39:06.928 --> 39:07.928
Hard and high.

39:08.013 --> 39:10.681
They succeeded at getting the object
that they were trying to establish.

39:10.765 --> 39:13.350
Because of the trajectory of the ball,
it looked way too high.

39:15.145 --> 39:17.688
So, a tough start
for the Erie warriors,

39:17.772 --> 39:21.692
as they drop a heartbreaker
to the Yankees, nine to nothing.

39:21.776 --> 39:24.319
Post-game show
is brought to you by...

39:26.781 --> 39:29.450
Christ, I can't find it.
The hell with it.

39:31.494 --> 39:33.620
<i>Hello.
Cuyahoga Sheet Metal.</i>

39:34.539 --> 39:37.291
Yeah, uh... you wouldn't happen
to have someone working there

39:37.459 --> 39:39.543
named Lynn Westland,
would you?

39:39.627 --> 39:41.545
<i>Nah, nobody here
by that name.</i>

39:41.629 --> 39:43.297
Didn't think so.

40:08.573 --> 40:09.948
Jake, you shouldn't
have come here.

40:10.033 --> 40:11.742
I was wondering
why you'd give an old friend

40:11.826 --> 40:13.476
a bum phone number.

40:14.162 --> 40:17.331
- Let's talk in my office, okay?
- I don't wanna talk in your office.

40:17.415 --> 40:19.666
I told you, I don't think it's a good idea
that we see each other.

40:19.751 --> 40:20.571
Why not?

40:20.835 --> 40:22.002
Because we don't have
anything in common.

40:22.087 --> 40:23.504
Sometimes I wonder
if we ever did.

40:23.588 --> 40:24.922
What are you talking about?

40:25.006 --> 40:27.508
We were both athletes,
world-class, hot for each other.

40:27.592 --> 40:28.926
What more could we
have in common?

40:29.010 --> 40:30.969
I stopped being an athlete
three years ago, Jake.

40:31.054 --> 40:32.898
Books are my life now.

40:34.516 --> 40:36.308
Don't you dare laugh.
In two years, I put together

40:36.392 --> 40:38.644
one of the best special collection
departments in the country.

40:38.728 --> 40:42.189
What is this? You're still sore
I never read "Moby Dick"?

40:42.992 --> 40:44.525
You never read anything
I asked you to.

40:44.609 --> 40:47.027
All right, I'll check it out now.
Is this the whale section?

40:47.112 --> 40:49.029
I'll bet what's-his-name
at the restaurant read it.

40:49.114 --> 40:50.656
Tom. His name's Tom,
and keep your voice down.

40:50.740 --> 40:51.990
What do you see
in this guy?

40:52.075 --> 40:53.784
Well, he's stable, intelligent,

40:53.868 --> 40:55.869
and I never found him in bed
with a stewardess.

40:55.954 --> 40:57.496
That's because no stewardess
would have 'im.

40:57.580 --> 40:59.623
Hey, wouldn't you rather be
with someone who's in demand?

40:59.707 --> 41:01.458
Oh, God, you know, Jake,
it's just like always.

41:01.543 --> 41:03.669
You don't take anything seriously.
Everything's a joke to you.

41:03.753 --> 41:06.964
Oh, come on, man, for Christ's sake.
I'm just tryin' to loosen things up.

41:07.048 --> 41:09.216
I'm gettin' frostbite here.

41:09.717 --> 41:12.074
Tom and I
are getting married in the fall.

41:13.388 --> 41:16.056
Oh, God, Lynn, that's crazy.
I had plans for us.

41:16.182 --> 41:17.266
- Plans?
- Yeah.

41:17.392 --> 41:19.059
How can you say
stuff like that?

41:19.144 --> 41:22.146
I haven't seen you in three years.
You never even wrote me a letter.

41:22.230 --> 41:23.313
Well, I'm sorry
about that,

41:23.398 --> 41:25.023
but I wasn't exactly proud
of my situation.

41:25.108 --> 41:26.859
Come on, you never thought
about me at all while I was gone?

41:26.943 --> 41:28.485
Yeah, Jake, not so loud.

41:28.570 --> 41:30.696
What about the three nights
we spent on the beach in Veracruz?

41:30.780 --> 41:32.156
You ever have nights like that
with Mr. Briefcase?

41:32.240 --> 41:33.538
What about the night
you had in Detroit

41:33.538 --> 41:34.700
with Miss Fuel Injection?

41:34.700 --> 41:35.784
Well, what was I
supposed to do?

41:35.910 --> 41:37.494
She bet me 50 bucks
she had a better body than you,

41:37.579 --> 41:38.620
and I had
to defend your honor.

41:38.705 --> 41:39.788
Oh, what a bunch
of bullshit!

41:39.873 --> 41:42.802
I have a much better body
than she does!

41:48.506 --> 41:49.631
She's right.

41:51.801 --> 41:53.177
You haven't changed
at all, have you?

41:53.261 --> 41:54.928
I'm afraid I have,
or I wouldn't be here.

41:55.013 --> 41:56.590
Come on, Lynn.
Don't make me do time

41:56.590 --> 41:58.340
for things that happened
years ago.

41:58.349 --> 41:59.516
Jake, I'm sorry.

41:59.601 --> 42:02.753
You'll just always be the little boy
who wouldn't grow up.

42:03.188 --> 42:04.271
Lynn.

42:08.443 --> 42:11.236
A quarter of the season's gone.
We're 15 and 24.

42:11.321 --> 42:12.821
Seven games out of first.

42:12.906 --> 42:14.448
That's bad.
It's not bad enough.

42:14.532 --> 42:17.696
Plus, this team is showing
signs of improvement.

42:17.911 --> 42:20.204
I didn't think we'd win
15 games all year.

42:20.288 --> 42:22.718
- Any ideas?
- On how we can get worse?

42:24.125 --> 42:26.376
How 'bout a series of fines
for good play?

42:26.461 --> 42:30.380
Maybe a 30,000-dollar bonus for
the guy voted least valuable player.

42:32.842 --> 42:34.760
Maybe the problem is...

42:36.137 --> 42:40.733
we're cuddling these guys
too much. Yeah.

42:47.690 --> 42:49.816
What's with this?
We never leave from down here.

42:49.901 --> 42:51.556
Maybe the Jetway
isn't workin'.

42:54.072 --> 42:56.198
Hey, this is good.
This is real good.

42:56.282 --> 42:57.699
A 757 to Milwaukee?

42:57.784 --> 43:01.106
No, that's not your plane.
Yours is this one rolling in.

43:17.053 --> 43:19.969
Oh, sure,
now you come around.

43:20.515 --> 43:21.682
He's not fooled.

43:23.601 --> 43:26.937
So, the sons of Geronimo,
still suffering from propeller-lag,

43:27.021 --> 43:29.856
are nipped by the Brewers
tonight, seven to nothing.

43:29.941 --> 43:32.317
The only excitement for the tribe
provided by Rick Vaughn,

43:32.402 --> 43:34.152
who set an American League
record

43:34.237 --> 43:36.488
by throwing four wild pitches
in one inning.

43:36.572 --> 43:38.365
Hey, congratulations,
Rick.

43:38.449 --> 43:41.660
Excuse me, Mr. Vaughn?
Can I have your autograph?

43:41.869 --> 43:43.245
Yeah, sure.

43:44.664 --> 43:45.956
My first autograph.

43:46.040 --> 43:47.958
Couldn't give these away
a couple of weeks ago.

43:48.084 --> 43:51.920
I saw your record on the news.
You made their Hall of Shame.

43:52.005 --> 43:53.630
Congratulations.

43:53.756 --> 43:56.174
- Thanks.
- Hey, thank you.

43:58.011 --> 43:59.770
Nice hair.

44:00.013 --> 44:02.345
Well, you're
a celebrity now, Vaughn.

44:02.473 --> 44:04.916
Thought you had to do
something good to be a celebrity.

44:05.059 --> 44:06.518
Not if you do it
colorfully.

44:09.981 --> 44:13.317
Call the stewardess, Vaughn.
I need one of those bags.

44:13.401 --> 44:16.052
There aren't
any stewardesses.

44:16.195 --> 44:18.061
I wonder
if there are any pilots.

44:21.826 --> 44:24.077
So, the tribe drops
its third straight on this trip.

44:24.162 --> 44:25.871
Six to one to the Rangers.

44:25.955 --> 44:29.249
For the Indians, one run on,
let's see, one hit.

44:29.667 --> 44:32.085
That's all we got,
one goddamn hit?

44:32.879 --> 44:34.588
You can't say "goddamn"
on the air.

44:34.672 --> 44:37.174
Don't worry,
nobody's listenin' anyway.

44:37.258 --> 44:38.441
- Hey, Mort.
- What?

44:38.441 --> 44:40.135
What is Comtec at?

44:41.596 --> 44:43.472
Buy it when it hits 34.

44:45.058 --> 44:46.058
What?

44:46.142 --> 44:48.101
"Moby Dick"?
What you reading that for?

44:49.937 --> 44:53.774
This happens to be a masterpiece
of American literature, that's why.

44:53.858 --> 44:55.400
Lynn turned you
on to that?

44:55.485 --> 44:57.611
Yeah, a long time ago.

44:57.695 --> 44:59.029
Well, look, if we ever
get outta here,

44:59.113 --> 45:01.406
me and the guys, we're gonna
go to a club later on tonight.

45:01.491 --> 45:02.714
Wanna come along?

45:03.326 --> 45:05.952
Well, I...
I got some reading to do.

45:06.037 --> 45:07.454
What, you got
a test or somethin'?

45:07.538 --> 45:09.581
Hey, Jake, man, why don't you
just go over there and see 'er?

45:09.665 --> 45:11.625
I mean, maybe she'll let you slide
on a couple o' these.

45:11.709 --> 45:14.002
Well, I would,
if I knew where she lived.

45:14.087 --> 45:17.172
That's easy.
Just tail her home from the library.

45:17.340 --> 45:20.359
What, do you mean sit in the car
and wait for her to come out?

45:20.760 --> 45:22.635
That's kinda juvenile,
don't you think?

45:22.635 --> 45:23.821
Yeah.

46:57.940 --> 46:59.983
Jake, this isn't my place.

47:00.067 --> 47:02.611
- Who is this, love?
- Whose is it?

47:03.196 --> 47:05.238
Oh, Mr.... Taylor, right?

47:06.324 --> 47:08.325
I remember you
from the restaurant.

47:08.503 --> 47:10.660
Lynn's told me
a lot about you.

47:11.704 --> 47:13.717
Uh, why don't you
come in for a while?

47:13.998 --> 47:16.124
Oh, no. I-I really
ought to be running along.

47:16.209 --> 47:19.002
-Yeah, he's gotta get going.
-Yeah.

47:19.086 --> 47:21.505
Really. Come on in
for a drink.

47:21.756 --> 47:22.923
Well...

47:24.800 --> 47:27.677
Excuse me, everybody.
This is Jake Taylor.

47:28.012 --> 47:30.347
Jake, Arthur
and Claire Holloway.

47:30.431 --> 47:31.598
- How do you do?
- Hi.

47:31.682 --> 47:34.017
- Hello.
- Brent and Janice Bowden.

47:34.101 --> 47:35.602
- How do you do?
- Hi. How are you?

47:35.686 --> 47:36.937
Hi.

47:37.021 --> 47:39.523
Jake is a professional
baseball player.

47:39.607 --> 47:40.774
Really?

47:41.734 --> 47:44.444
Jake, what brings you here
this evening?

47:45.613 --> 47:48.365
Well, I... wanted to discuss
a couple of books with Lynn,

47:48.449 --> 47:51.076
and I thought
this was her place.

47:51.452 --> 47:54.204
Well, it... soon will be.

47:55.623 --> 47:59.459
Yeah. I heard you were engaged.
Congratulations.

48:03.923 --> 48:05.257
Thank you.

48:05.341 --> 48:09.052
- What can I... get you to drink?
- Beer will be fine.

48:09.136 --> 48:10.887
Great. Have a seat.

48:23.818 --> 48:25.944
- Oh, that's great.
- Yeah.

48:26.028 --> 48:27.487
- No, thanks.
- Sir.

48:29.031 --> 48:30.031
No.

48:37.456 --> 48:41.084
Well... What team
do you play for, Jake?

48:41.168 --> 48:42.627
The Indians.

48:42.712 --> 48:44.546
- Here in Cleveland?
- Mmm-hmm.

48:44.839 --> 48:47.173
I didn't know
they still had a team.

48:47.258 --> 48:50.635
Yeah. We got uniforms
and everything. It's really great.

48:51.846 --> 48:56.474
They're in last right now,
but hopefully moving up... eh, Jake?

48:57.607 --> 48:58.515
Eh.

49:00.396 --> 49:04.482
I've heard baseball players
make very good salaries these days.

49:05.443 --> 49:08.612
Well, that depends on
how good they are, I guess.

49:08.863 --> 49:10.488
How good are you?

49:12.199 --> 49:14.200
I make the league minimum.

49:16.454 --> 49:18.113
He was one of the best
in baseball

49:18.113 --> 49:20.586
before he had problems
with his knees.

49:25.546 --> 49:28.455
Well, Jake, uh,
what are you gonna do

49:28.455 --> 49:29.788
when your career's over?

49:29.800 --> 49:33.094
I mean, you... can't play
baseball forever, can you?

49:33.888 --> 49:37.363
- Eh, something will come up.
- Will it?

49:40.728 --> 49:43.063
Well, I thought
I'd go to Hawaii,

49:44.023 --> 49:46.441
have a couple of kids who grow up
to be Olympic champions.

49:47.401 --> 49:50.070
Really? In... what event?

49:50.571 --> 49:51.738
Swimming.

49:53.407 --> 49:55.116
The 200-meter
individual medley.

49:55.201 --> 49:57.661
I figure it ought to be
real big by then.

49:57.745 --> 49:59.162
You got
the girl picked out?

49:59.246 --> 50:02.749
I did, but I wasn't smart enough
to hold on to her.

50:06.170 --> 50:08.380
You used to be an athlete,
didn't you, Lynn?

50:08.464 --> 50:09.798
Yeah.

50:09.882 --> 50:12.217
What did you do?

50:13.803 --> 50:16.304
200-meter
individual medley.

50:22.770 --> 50:25.397
Uh... Alternate
on the '80 Olympic team.

50:26.107 --> 50:28.942
Oh, really? Well...

50:32.947 --> 50:34.739
Well, I better get goin'.

50:34.824 --> 50:36.366
Oh, let me walk you out.

50:36.450 --> 50:38.952
- Nice meeting all of you.
- Yeah.

50:42.039 --> 50:44.457
- Thanks for the beer.
- Don't mention it.

50:44.542 --> 50:47.377
I'll let you know if I land a job.
I know you're very concerned.

50:47.503 --> 50:49.754
Yeah, well, I, uh...

50:50.548 --> 50:51.385
just wanted Lynn to know

50:51.385 --> 50:52.990
what she would have had
ahead of her.

50:55.136 --> 50:57.595
- Stay away from her.
- Suck my dick.

51:08.816 --> 51:11.359
- Pepper says you wanted to see me.
- Yeah, Rick.

51:11.444 --> 51:13.653
Come on in. Have a seat.

51:19.285 --> 51:22.203
Rick, I'm not gonna
beat around the bush here.

51:22.288 --> 51:25.582
You got a great arm.
It's one of the best I've ever seen,

51:25.666 --> 51:29.294
but your control hasn't come around
like we'd hoped it would.

51:29.503 --> 51:31.629
Now, a lot of pitchers
started off wild,

51:31.714 --> 51:34.340
and after they worked it out
in the minors for a while,

51:34.425 --> 51:36.426
they went on
to great careers.

51:36.510 --> 51:38.136
Take Ryan there.

51:45.144 --> 51:47.937
- What about 'im?
- Never mind Ryan.

51:56.071 --> 51:58.198
Read these letters for me.

52:02.077 --> 52:04.204
You can't read them,
can you?

52:09.168 --> 52:12.462
Yo, man, they look nice.
I had a pair just like 'em.

52:13.547 --> 52:16.800
Well, after the game, I'm gonna
pick out a pair that's more me.

52:16.884 --> 52:18.468
- Good luck.
- They look good.

52:18.552 --> 52:21.596
Besides, seeing's
the most important thing, son.

52:21.889 --> 52:24.265
I don't think
it's that important.

52:27.394 --> 52:28.603
Fuck.

52:29.188 --> 52:31.815
All right,
let's hit the field.

53:01.929 --> 53:03.847
Up your butt, Jobu.

53:19.113 --> 53:22.448
Yo, bartender!
Jobu needs a refill !

53:23.117 --> 53:25.243
- Head's up!
- Yo, watch it!

53:25.327 --> 53:26.870
Hustle! Let's go!

53:26.954 --> 53:28.580
- Goddamn!
- Shit.

53:31.834 --> 53:33.784
We're in the ninth.

53:34.962 --> 53:36.254
Two down,
a man on first,

53:36.338 --> 53:38.882
and the Indians clinging
to a one-run lead.

53:38.966 --> 53:41.259
Ricky Vaughn,
the kid they call "Wild Thing",

53:41.343 --> 53:44.512
one out away from
his first major league victory.

53:45.306 --> 53:47.390
Vaughn's been lookin' good
out there today.

53:47.474 --> 53:49.769
Don't worry,
he'll blow it.

53:49.804 --> 53:52.604
Vaughn's showing some signs
of fatigue out there.

53:52.688 --> 53:55.732
He seems to have lost
some zip on his fastball.

53:55.816 --> 53:57.775
Slow curve. Here's a swing,
and a bouncing ball.

53:57.860 --> 54:00.653
Dorn has a chance to make the play.
He can't get it.

54:00.738 --> 54:03.990
Clark diggin' around second.
He'll make it to third easily.

54:04.074 --> 54:07.201
And the A's have
runners at the corners.

54:07.494 --> 54:10.163
Dorn didn't get much of a jump
on that ball, Monte.

54:10.247 --> 54:13.445
But let's give him credit,
at least he didn't spike himself.

54:15.419 --> 54:16.836
You want me to get 'im
out of there, Lou?

54:16.921 --> 54:17.962
No.

54:18.047 --> 54:20.590
He's come this far,
let's see if he can finish it.

54:20.674 --> 54:22.759
Come on, we need
some defense here!

54:22.843 --> 54:25.053
Johnny, uh, maybe we ought to do
one of those waves.

54:25.137 --> 54:27.489
So, Vaughn
in a little trouble here.

54:28.182 --> 54:30.099
But I'll tell you,
these Cleveland fans are great.

54:30.184 --> 54:32.352
Listen to them
get behind Vaughn.

54:32.436 --> 54:35.104
- Hey, way to go, Rick!
- Go, Rick!

54:35.189 --> 54:38.274
Come on, baby. Come on, Ricky.
Come on, Ricky.

54:39.526 --> 54:42.654
Okay, Ricky, there's two outs,
so forget about the runners.

54:42.738 --> 54:46.032
Get this guy at the plate.
Come on, Rick. Get tough.

54:46.825 --> 54:47.825
This guy's
a first-ball hitter.

54:47.910 --> 54:49.827
You gotta come up
with something nasty.

54:49.912 --> 54:51.746
Fucking Dorn.
This game should be over by now.

54:51.830 --> 54:54.290
He could have had that ball.
He tanked it on purpose.

54:54.375 --> 54:56.751
This isn't the California
Penal League, Vaughn.

54:56.835 --> 54:58.169
We're professionals here.

54:58.253 --> 54:59.712
We don't tank plays
for personal reasons,

54:59.797 --> 55:01.547
so cut the crybaby shit.

55:01.632 --> 55:04.342
Now, you pitched a hell of a game.
You wanna finish it, don't you?

55:04.426 --> 55:06.219
- Yeah.
- All right.

55:06.637 --> 55:08.680
Think you can throw
a strike on this pitch?

55:08.764 --> 55:11.307
There's not gonna be much on it.
My arm feels like jello right now.

55:11.392 --> 55:13.900
Just get it over the plate.
I want 'im to swing.

55:14.186 --> 55:16.980
Last time I did that,
the guy hit one that hasn't landed yet.

55:17.064 --> 55:18.481
Don't worry about it.
I'll take care of it.

55:18.565 --> 55:21.275
<i>27, right fielder
Mike Rexman.</i>

55:21.360 --> 55:22.568
Hi, Rexman.

55:22.653 --> 55:24.779
Hell of a situation we got here.
Two on, two out,

55:24.863 --> 55:27.074
you guys trailing
by one in the ninth.

55:27.157 --> 55:29.158
You got a chance to be a hero
on national television.

55:29.243 --> 55:30.496
If you don't blow it.

55:30.828 --> 55:32.996
By the way, I saw your wife
at the Capri Lounge last night.

55:33.080 --> 55:35.164
Hell of a dancer.
You must be very, very proud.

55:35.249 --> 55:36.332
That guy she was with,

55:36.417 --> 55:38.126
I mean, I'm sure he's
a close personal friend and all,

55:38.210 --> 55:39.335
but tell me,
what was he doing

55:39.420 --> 55:41.671
wearing her panties
on his head?

55:41.922 --> 55:43.381
Swung on and popped up.

55:43.465 --> 55:47.260
Uh-oh, Rexie, I don't think
this one's got the distance.

55:48.887 --> 55:51.389
Taylor under it. He's got it,
and this ball game is over...

55:51.473 --> 55:52.515
Shit.

55:52.599 --> 55:54.434
... as the Indians hold out
for a 3-2 victory.

55:54.518 --> 55:55.727
Yeah.

55:55.811 --> 55:57.915
Startin' to come together, Pepper.
Startin' to come together.

55:57.915 --> 55:59.280
Yeah.

56:03.485 --> 56:05.494
Knock it off, Charlie.

56:22.796 --> 56:24.547
Well, hi, Jake.
Come on in.

56:24.631 --> 56:26.382
Hi, Suzanne.

56:26.467 --> 56:28.593
- How are you?
- Oh, I'm fine, thanks.

56:28.677 --> 56:31.846
I was just wondering if I might have
a quick word with Roger?

56:31.972 --> 56:34.265
Well, sure. He's in the solarium.
I'll get some coffee.

56:34.349 --> 56:35.975
Oh, thank you.

56:36.101 --> 56:39.562
<i>United Airlines down
three-quarters at 141 .</i>

56:39.646 --> 56:43.399
<i>lnternational Business Machines down
one-half to 96 and three-eighths.</i>

56:43.484 --> 56:44.859
American Telephone
& Telegraph...

56:44.943 --> 56:47.361
- Hey, Jake.
- Hey, Roger.

56:48.655 --> 56:49.614
Nice place.

56:49.698 --> 56:50.740
Yeah, we're still
working on it,

56:50.824 --> 56:54.042
trying to figure if we wanna take
this room Oriental or Santa Fe.

56:54.745 --> 56:57.121
Listen, Rog, I had to talk to you
about something,

56:57.206 --> 56:59.290
and I didn't wanna do it
in front of the rest of the team.

56:59.374 --> 57:01.292
Yeah, sure. What is it?
Here, have a seat. Want a beer?

57:01.376 --> 57:02.861
Oh, no, thank you.

57:04.505 --> 57:06.964
You, uh, have financial problems?

57:07.132 --> 57:09.050
I could put you on
to a great investment guy.

57:09.134 --> 57:12.637
No, I... I don't have much
of a portfolio right now,

57:12.721 --> 57:14.389
but, you know,
what I was concerned about

57:14.389 --> 57:16.808
was, uh, why you didn't come up
with that grounder

57:16.892 --> 57:18.559
that Reichart hit
in the ninth.

57:18.644 --> 57:19.582
It was out of my reach.

57:20.005 --> 57:21.902
What do you want me
to do, dive for it?

57:25.025 --> 57:27.568
Rog, it could
have meant the game.

57:27.694 --> 57:30.071
Oh, come on.
Cut the rah-rah shit, Taylor.

57:30.155 --> 57:31.364
Year after this,
I go free agent.

57:31.448 --> 57:32.932
Plus, my agent and I
got a couple of plans

57:32.932 --> 57:34.276
for life after baseball.

57:34.535 --> 57:36.536
So, I am not about
to risk major injury,

57:36.620 --> 57:38.871
or deface this property,
for a collection of stiffs.

57:39.873 --> 57:40.998
You know, Dorn,

57:41.083 --> 57:44.127
I liked you so much better
when you were just a ballplayer.

57:44.211 --> 57:45.628
You were
really great once.

57:45.712 --> 57:47.463
If you wanna be
an interior decorator now,

57:47.548 --> 57:48.840
that's none
of my business,

57:48.924 --> 57:51.217
but some of us
still need this team.

57:51.301 --> 57:54.720
Now, you listen to me.
This is my last shot at a winner.

57:54.930 --> 57:57.056
And for the younger guys,
it could be their only shot.

57:57.141 --> 57:59.058
I don't know
what happened to you,

57:59.143 --> 58:03.062
but if you ever, ever tank
another play like you did today,

58:03.897 --> 58:05.542
I'm gonna
cut your nuts off

58:06.083 --> 58:08.972
and stuff 'em
down your fucking throat.

58:10.237 --> 58:11.821
Coffee, anybody?

58:19.079 --> 58:21.068
Hello again,
all you Wahoo maniacs.

58:21.068 --> 58:22.879
This is Harry Doyle
welcoming you

58:22.879 --> 58:25.334
to another edition
of Teepee Talk.

58:25.419 --> 58:27.003
Hey, in case
you haven't noticed,

58:27.087 --> 58:29.547
and judging by the attendance,
you haven't,

58:29.631 --> 58:32.425
the Indians have managed
to win a few here and there,

58:32.509 --> 58:34.927
and are threatening
to climb outta the cellar.

58:43.520 --> 58:47.648
Wild thing,
you make my heart sing.

58:52.779 --> 58:55.281
You know,
they could be a lot worse.

58:56.450 --> 58:58.492
You know, these guys
ain't so fucking bad.

59:03.415 --> 59:07.460
Oh, boy, this old body
could use a soak.

59:07.544 --> 59:09.837
Yeah? Well, forget it,
cause it ain't workin' again.

59:09.922 --> 59:13.299
Damn it! I thought
they were gonna replace this thing.

59:13.884 --> 59:16.385
Hey! No hot water
in here.

59:16.470 --> 59:19.388
I've had it with this
nickel-and-dime stuff.

59:19.598 --> 59:22.183
I'm gonna get
that bitch on the phone.

59:22.935 --> 59:25.561
- You wanted to talk to the bitch?
- Yeah.

59:26.021 --> 59:27.535
Don't you think
you ought to cover yourself

59:27.535 --> 59:29.752
with a towel first,Mr. Brown?

59:29.787 --> 59:31.192
We're out of towels,

59:31.276 --> 59:34.070
and I'm too old
to go diving into lockers.

59:34.154 --> 59:36.155
I can take it
if you can.

59:38.325 --> 59:41.953
What happened to the new whirlpool
we were supposed to get?

59:43.163 --> 59:46.666
Revenue problems have forced us
to cut back on equipment.

59:49.127 --> 59:50.503
Cups still work,
though.

59:50.587 --> 59:52.590
We'll simply have to fix
the old whirlpool.

59:52.590 --> 59:54.966
You have fixed it
six times already.

59:55.092 --> 59:57.260
Now there's no hot water
in the shower.

59:57.344 --> 01:00:00.346
The pipes in this building
are old and rusted.

01:00:00.847 --> 01:00:05.153
We're replacing them,
but... it's a long, expensive process.

01:00:05.227 --> 01:00:06.269
Sorry.

01:00:06.353 --> 01:00:07.024
How am I supposed
to keep my players healthy

01:00:07.024 --> 01:00:09.272
with cold water
and no therapy equipment?

01:00:09.356 --> 01:00:12.630
Your players will just have
to get a little tougher.

01:00:13.652 --> 01:00:16.737
What are they,
a bunch of pansies?

01:00:16.822 --> 01:00:20.992
Over 162 games,
even tough guys get sprains,

01:00:21.076 --> 01:00:22.285
sore arms, muscle pulls.

01:00:22.369 --> 01:00:24.091
It's only temporary.

01:00:24.496 --> 01:00:27.248
Besides, these guys
weren't playing that good

01:00:27.332 --> 01:00:29.041
when the equipment
was working.

01:00:29.126 --> 01:00:31.460
If I could get anybody
to come out and watch this team,

01:00:31.545 --> 01:00:33.748
none of this
would be necessary.

01:00:35.507 --> 01:00:39.218
You ought to be grateful
I can still afford to pay your salary.

01:00:56.903 --> 01:00:59.238
Harris winds and delivers.

01:00:59.323 --> 01:01:01.907
Vaseline ball, swung on
and grounded to short.

01:01:01.992 --> 01:01:05.202
Hey, easy play for Malina.
Up with it, throws to first.

01:01:05.287 --> 01:01:06.746
And this ball game is over,

01:01:06.830 --> 01:01:09.874
as the Indians
beat the Tigers five to four.

01:01:10.250 --> 01:01:14.420
Harris struggled, but picked up
his ninth win of the season.

01:01:35.942 --> 01:01:37.777
Frank,
I need a car, quick,

01:01:37.861 --> 01:01:39.570
and mine's on the other side
of the stadium.

01:01:39.654 --> 01:01:41.697
- Take the bullpen car.
- Yeah.

01:03:01.111 --> 01:03:03.154
Whose place
are we at this time?

01:03:03.488 --> 01:03:04.655
Mine.

01:03:07.451 --> 01:03:09.410
Did you follow me again?

01:03:09.494 --> 01:03:11.537
I spotted you
in the stands.

01:03:11.621 --> 01:03:14.540
Figured you wanted
to see me about somethin'.

01:03:15.250 --> 01:03:17.793
I just wanted
to see you play.

01:03:18.295 --> 01:03:19.295
How was I?

01:03:19.379 --> 01:03:20.597
You ought to open
your stance a little.

01:03:20.597 --> 01:03:22.018
They're pitching you inside.

01:03:24.134 --> 01:03:27.414
I'll try that.
What's all this?

01:03:29.306 --> 01:03:31.223
I'm moving in with Tom.

01:03:33.393 --> 01:03:36.218
- Going uptown, huh?
- No.

01:03:36.396 --> 01:03:37.813
Not going uptown.

01:03:37.898 --> 01:03:41.525
Just... wanna lead a regular life,
you know. Like an adult, maybe?

01:03:41.902 --> 01:03:44.149
You think
I can't lead a regular life?

01:03:44.154 --> 01:03:46.380
Oh, God, Jake.

01:03:46.781 --> 01:03:47.990
Do you like the life
you've had?

01:03:48.074 --> 01:03:51.452
You like hangin' out
with the boys, living in hotels,

01:03:51.578 --> 01:03:54.788
having girls send you
their underwear in the mail.

01:03:55.081 --> 01:03:57.941
Remember the surprise party
I threw for you on your birthday?

01:03:58.251 --> 01:03:59.003
You never showed up,

01:03:59.003 --> 01:04:02.505
but... the doorbell rang once,
and we all got real quiet

01:04:02.589 --> 01:04:04.531
and hid
behind the furniture.

01:04:04.758 --> 01:04:07.051
It was a guy to serve you
with a paternity suit.

01:04:07.135 --> 01:04:08.078
That was a hoax.

01:04:08.849 --> 01:04:10.627
The girl was looking
for some publicity.

01:04:10.627 --> 01:04:13.432
Yeah, but you'd obviously
been with her.

01:04:13.517 --> 01:04:16.018
And it happened
in front of all of our friends.

01:04:16.102 --> 01:04:18.145
Those days are gone,
Lynn.

01:04:19.481 --> 01:04:22.766
I'm just a guy tryin'
to put his life back together.

01:04:24.569 --> 01:04:27.196
I've come back to you
so many times, Jake.

01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:29.740
I can't afford
to believe you anymore.

01:04:29.824 --> 01:04:30.908
Well...

01:04:32.160 --> 01:04:34.453
I guess this is
our last hurrah, then.

01:04:35.038 --> 01:04:37.122
Yeah. I guess so.

01:04:46.841 --> 01:04:47.925
Hey,

01:04:48.969 --> 01:04:51.492
did you ever read
"Moby Dick"?

01:04:52.973 --> 01:04:54.974
Cover to cover, babe.

01:04:56.434 --> 01:04:59.362
- When's the wedding?
- October 3rd.

01:04:59.771 --> 01:05:03.527
- Your folks like this guy?
- You're still their favorite.

01:05:05.485 --> 01:05:07.695
- Gonna be a big wedding?
- No, Tom doesn't like big weddings.

01:05:07.779 --> 01:05:10.906
You know, you could have read
Plot Outlines of 101 Great Novels.

01:05:10.991 --> 01:05:12.237
- Where?
- At any library.

01:05:12.237 --> 01:05:16.539
- No, no, no. Where's the wedding?
- Oh, All Saints, on Euclid.

01:05:26.172 --> 01:05:28.340
- Nice church.
- Yeah.

01:05:34.848 --> 01:05:37.224
- Who saved Ishmael at the end?
- What?

01:05:37.350 --> 01:05:39.643
Nobody. It was, uh, Queequoc's cof....
Queequeg's coffin.

01:05:39.728 --> 01:05:40.935
Yeah.

01:05:44.691 --> 01:05:46.358
- Am I invited?
- Where?

01:05:46.443 --> 01:05:48.611
- To the wedding.
- Yeah.

01:05:49.029 --> 01:05:50.362
- Lynn?
- What?

01:05:50.447 --> 01:05:52.448
The zipper
on your skirt's stuck.

01:05:52.532 --> 01:05:54.533
Use your imagination.

01:05:57.287 --> 01:05:59.163
You know,
this doesn't change anything.

01:05:59.539 --> 01:06:01.123
We were always good
at... this.

01:06:19.017 --> 01:06:20.976
We're 60 and 60.
Nine games out of first.

01:06:21.061 --> 01:06:22.853
Who do these guys
think they are?

01:06:22.937 --> 01:06:24.406
Maybe you just have
to accept the fact

01:06:24.406 --> 01:06:25.687
they're not as bad
as you hoped.

01:06:25.687 --> 01:06:27.626
I don't have
to accept anything.

01:06:28.068 --> 01:06:30.110
Attendance is only just
beginning to rise.

01:06:30.195 --> 01:06:32.821
If we can force a losing streak,
we can still turn this thing around.

01:06:32.906 --> 01:06:33.676
What's left to do?

01:06:33.676 --> 01:06:35.349
You've taken away
everything you can.

01:06:35.700 --> 01:06:36.867
Not everything.

01:06:43.291 --> 01:06:46.788
Hey, Ricky, I'll trade you Song of
Hiawatha for The Deerslayer.

01:06:47.045 --> 01:06:49.254
Nah, I'm not into
Song of Hiawatha.

01:06:49.381 --> 01:06:52.257
Veg-head, I think I got one here
that's right up your alley.

01:06:52.342 --> 01:06:54.176
Crime and Punishment.

01:06:57.389 --> 01:07:00.099
Hey, is that a
detective story? Yeah?

01:07:02.435 --> 01:07:03.560
"WiId Thing" Vaughn

01:07:03.645 --> 01:07:06.605
roughed up in his only other
appearance against the Yankees,

01:07:06.690 --> 01:07:07.856
in a little jam here.

01:07:07.941 --> 01:07:09.483
He fanned Burton
to open the inning,

01:07:09.567 --> 01:07:12.361
walked Saslow, gave up
a double to Billy Leff,

01:07:12.445 --> 01:07:13.862
which will bring up
Haywood,

01:07:13.947 --> 01:07:16.281
who leads the league
in most offensive categories,

01:07:16.366 --> 01:07:18.117
including nose hair.

01:07:18.243 --> 01:07:21.395
When this guy sneezes,
he looks like a party favor.

01:07:21.579 --> 01:07:23.664
Taylor,
they ain't released you yet?

01:07:23.748 --> 01:07:26.159
Haywood's a convicted felon,
isn't he, Monte?

01:07:26.459 --> 01:07:28.961
- Uhh, doesn't really say it here.
- Well, he should be.

01:07:29.087 --> 01:07:31.547
Vaughn among the league leaders
in strikeouts now,

01:07:31.631 --> 01:07:33.465
up on the rubber
and ready to work.

01:07:33.550 --> 01:07:36.093
And from the wind-up,
here he comes.

01:07:36.177 --> 01:07:40.013
Haywood swings and crushes one
towards South America.

01:07:40.140 --> 01:07:42.725
Tomlinson's gonna need
a visa to catch this one.

01:07:42.809 --> 01:07:46.997
It is outta here, and there's
nothing left but a vapor trail.

01:07:47.063 --> 01:07:50.816
Vaughn continues to have problems
with Haywood and the Yankees.

01:07:50.900 --> 01:07:52.276
Oh, boy.

01:08:00.535 --> 01:08:01.702
Hi, Lou.

01:08:01.786 --> 01:08:03.328
Donovan,
what are you doin' here?

01:08:03.413 --> 01:08:06.317
Well, I just wanted to get
back out on the road again.

01:08:06.458 --> 01:08:08.073
You know, you had
a hell of a road trip.

01:08:08.073 --> 01:08:10.071
You nearly pulled
that one out today.

01:08:10.106 --> 01:08:12.782
Some day we'll figure out
how to beat those guys.

01:08:13.590 --> 01:08:16.305
You know, you've done
a great job this year.

01:08:16.426 --> 01:08:19.219
60 and 61 is hardly
a great job.

01:08:19.304 --> 01:08:21.596
With this club, it is.

01:08:22.140 --> 01:08:25.542
You know, there's a lot of talent
on this club, Charlie.

01:08:25.577 --> 01:08:27.352
The veterans are startin'
to play back to form,

01:08:27.437 --> 01:08:29.354
and the rookies are developin'
faster than I thought.

01:08:29.439 --> 01:08:32.649
There's two or three
potential all-stars in there.

01:08:33.651 --> 01:08:36.153
I think we're a contender,
right now.

01:08:36.237 --> 01:08:37.988
You really believe that,
don't you?

01:08:38.072 --> 01:08:39.281
I know it.

01:08:39.365 --> 01:08:42.658
All we need is something
to bring it all together.

01:08:44.328 --> 01:08:46.662
Rachel Phelps will never
allow that to happen.

01:08:53.087 --> 01:08:55.520
Can I have your attention,
please?

01:08:57.175 --> 01:09:00.551
I have something I think
you all ought to know about.

01:09:01.095 --> 01:09:06.265
It seems that Mrs. Phelps
doesn't think too highly of our worth.

01:09:08.060 --> 01:09:09.812
She put this team
together

01:09:09.895 --> 01:09:10.604
because she thought

01:09:10.604 --> 01:09:13.368
we'd be bad enough
to finish dead last,

01:09:13.566 --> 01:09:15.149
knocking attendance
down to the point

01:09:15.234 --> 01:09:18.111
where she could
move the team to Miami

01:09:18.196 --> 01:09:21.365
and get rid of all of us
for better personnel.

01:09:21.908 --> 01:09:25.479
- Even me?
- Even you, Dorn.

01:09:25.479 --> 01:09:27.453
What if we don't finish last?

01:09:27.538 --> 01:09:30.332
She'll replace you
with somebody who will.

01:09:30.917 --> 01:09:34.127
After this season,
you'll be sent back to the minors

01:09:34.212 --> 01:09:36.796
or given your outright release.

01:09:48.268 --> 01:09:51.603
Well, then I guess
there's only one thing left to do.

01:09:52.145 --> 01:09:53.564
What's that?

01:09:54.566 --> 01:09:56.775
Win the whole fuckin' thing.

01:10:07.203 --> 01:10:09.454
- Yeah.
- Yes!

01:10:12.500 --> 01:10:13.625
Yes!

01:10:16.546 --> 01:10:18.087
Yeah.

01:10:25.513 --> 01:10:30.017
I figure it's gonna take
32 more victories to win this thing.

01:10:30.810 --> 01:10:34.605
Every time we win,
we peel a section.

01:10:35.481 --> 01:10:36.648
Yeah.

01:10:43.031 --> 01:10:44.312
Come on.

01:10:49.787 --> 01:10:51.163
Oh, shit.

01:11:02.592 --> 01:11:03.759
Strike!

01:11:04.093 --> 01:11:05.093
He's out!

01:11:12.810 --> 01:11:14.119
Safe!

01:11:15.355 --> 01:11:17.022
- Yeah, man.
- Yes!

01:11:32.288 --> 01:11:33.941
Strike!

01:11:41.339 --> 01:11:42.464
Shit!

01:11:47.220 --> 01:11:48.297
He's out!

01:11:51.349 --> 01:11:53.741
Hello.
Do you know us?

01:11:53.741 --> 01:11:56.708
We're a Major League
baseball team.

01:11:56.896 --> 01:11:59.806
But since we haven't won
a pennant in over 30 years,

01:11:59.941 --> 01:12:01.882
nobody recognizes us,

01:12:01.917 --> 01:12:03.944
not even
in our own hometown.

01:12:04.028 --> 01:12:07.030
That's why we carry
the American Express card.

01:12:07.115 --> 01:12:10.242
No matter how far out
of first we are, it's cool.

01:12:10.535 --> 01:12:11.994
You know, it keeps us
from getting shut out

01:12:12.078 --> 01:12:15.247
at our favorite hotels
and restaurant-type places.

01:12:15.331 --> 01:12:17.624
So, if you're looking
for some big-league clout,

01:12:17.709 --> 01:12:20.085
apply for that little green
home-run hitter.

01:12:20.169 --> 01:12:21.920
Look what it's done for us.

01:12:22.005 --> 01:12:24.589
People still
don't recognize us, but...

01:12:25.425 --> 01:12:27.893
We're contenders now.

01:12:28.428 --> 01:12:31.847
The American Express card.
Don't steal home without it.

01:13:36.162 --> 01:13:37.355
Yeah!

01:13:51.177 --> 01:13:52.313
Safe!

01:13:56.474 --> 01:13:58.183
Cowabunga!

01:13:58.267 --> 01:14:00.143
Good afternoon,
ladies and gentlemen.

01:14:00.228 --> 01:14:01.478
The incredible has happened.

01:14:01.562 --> 01:14:03.730
Even though it comes as
no surprise to this commentator,

01:14:03.815 --> 01:14:07.109
the Indians have finished
the regular season in a first-place tie

01:14:07.193 --> 01:14:08.193
with the New York Yankees

01:14:08.277 --> 01:14:10.737
on the strength of a 4-2 win
over the White Sox

01:14:10.822 --> 01:14:12.864
in Chicago today.

01:14:19.372 --> 01:14:20.831
All right!

01:14:21.207 --> 01:14:23.959
Not bad for a has-been
and a couple of never-will-be's, huh?

01:14:24.043 --> 01:14:25.293
Yeah. Yeah.

01:14:25.378 --> 01:14:28.026
We haven't won anything yet.
Still got one game to go.

01:14:29.382 --> 01:14:32.467
<i>The Indians are still savoring
their victory today in Chicago</i>

01:14:32.552 --> 01:14:34.469
<i>but are due
to leave in a few hours.</i>

01:14:34.554 --> 01:14:36.221
<i>We're going to go back now
to Ross Farmer,</i>

01:14:36.305 --> 01:14:38.431
<i>who's standing by
with the team at their hotel.</i>

01:14:38.516 --> 01:14:40.058
<i>Thank you, Hal.
Well, as you can see,</i>

01:14:40.143 --> 01:14:42.269
<i>the Indians are
in high spirits tonight,</i>

01:14:42.353 --> 01:14:45.188
<i>looking forward to
their final showdown</i>

01:14:45.398 --> 01:14:47.023
<i>with the Yankees.</i>

01:14:47.692 --> 01:14:50.610
<i>Who will start that game
is still a matter of some conjecture,</i>

01:14:50.695 --> 01:14:54.156
<i>but the smart money is on
the crafty veteran, Eddie Harris,</i>

01:14:54.240 --> 01:14:58.076
<i>or the young fireballer,
"Wild Thing" Ricky Vaughn.</i>

01:14:58.244 --> 01:14:59.619
<i>Meanwhile,
the Yanks have announced</i>

01:14:59.704 --> 01:15:02.664
<i>that they will start
20-game winner Steve Jackson,</i>

01:15:02.748 --> 01:15:05.458
<i>a curve-ball specialist
who has shut...</i>

01:15:13.926 --> 01:15:15.692
You wanted
to see me, skip?

01:15:17.096 --> 01:15:19.222
Yeah, Rick. Have a seat.

01:15:23.561 --> 01:15:26.563
I just wanted to tell you
that... I'm starting Harris

01:15:26.647 --> 01:15:28.857
against the Yankees
tomorrow,

01:15:28.941 --> 01:15:32.110
even though I know
it's... your turn in the rotation.

01:15:32.737 --> 01:15:34.696
He's got
a little more experience,

01:15:34.780 --> 01:15:37.741
with a bit better record
against the Yankees.

01:15:38.951 --> 01:15:41.786
Yeah, I guess
what's... best for the team.

01:15:41.871 --> 01:15:44.080
Don't read anything
into it, Rick.

01:15:44.165 --> 01:15:46.875
You're one o' the guys
that got us here.

01:15:51.130 --> 01:15:52.214
Hello again, everybody.

01:15:52.298 --> 01:15:54.883
Harry Doyle coming to you
live from the stadium,

01:15:54.967 --> 01:15:57.010
where the Indians
have just returned home

01:15:57.094 --> 01:15:59.554
in preparation
for their one-game play-off

01:15:59.639 --> 01:16:02.891
with the New York Yankees for
the Eastern Division Championship.

01:16:02.975 --> 01:16:06.102
We'll have interviews
on Indians Powwow at 8 o'clock,

01:16:06.187 --> 01:16:10.023
but in the meantime, get
your tomahawks ready, Cleveland.

01:16:10.900 --> 01:16:12.416
You're the best!

01:16:56.070 --> 01:16:58.620
You mind
if I join you?

01:16:59.198 --> 01:17:01.935
I don't think I'd be
very good company right now.

01:17:02.326 --> 01:17:07.767
- Why not?
- Nothing. Job problem.

01:17:09.375 --> 01:17:11.793
- I'm a... ballplayer.
- I know.

01:17:12.378 --> 01:17:14.879
But that's not
why I came over here.

01:17:14.964 --> 01:17:17.132
I don't chase ballplayers.

01:17:17.216 --> 01:17:19.384
Why'd you come
over here then?

01:17:22.138 --> 01:17:26.778
Because you are the sexiest man
I have ever laid eyes on,

01:17:29.312 --> 01:17:32.355
and you look like
you could use a friend.

01:17:36.569 --> 01:17:37.736
Check.

01:17:42.908 --> 01:17:46.285
- Where are you goin'?
- I've got to get home.

01:17:47.747 --> 01:17:50.081
I don't think
I ever got your name.

01:17:50.166 --> 01:17:53.675
Suzanne. Suzanne Dorn.

01:17:55.755 --> 01:17:57.213
Suzanne Dorn?

01:18:00.760 --> 01:18:02.385
Mrs. Roger Dorn.

01:18:05.598 --> 01:18:09.236
So long.
You're a great kid.

01:18:17.943 --> 01:18:19.444
Hi, Jake.

01:18:29.747 --> 01:18:32.582
I didn't know who she was.
I swear to God.

01:18:32.958 --> 01:18:36.171
Got one off the chest,
but he's up with it, and it's over!

01:18:37.463 --> 01:18:41.374
Bye-bye, honey. See you
at the park. Wish me luck.

01:18:44.053 --> 01:18:45.553
Before you go,

01:18:46.389 --> 01:18:48.575
there's something
I'd like to tell you.

01:18:48.575 --> 01:18:49.676
What?

01:18:49.711 --> 01:18:51.893
I don't know what Dorn's wife
is up to, but I think it best

01:18:51.977 --> 01:18:54.145
if you get dressed out early
and out to the bullpen

01:18:54.230 --> 01:18:56.748
before Dorn hits
the clubhouse, okay?

01:18:57.942 --> 01:18:59.734
Hey, we got
a big problem.

01:18:59.819 --> 01:19:01.820
Cerrano wants some
extra power for tonight.

01:19:01.904 --> 01:19:04.948
He's looking to sacrifice
a live chicken.

01:19:05.032 --> 01:19:06.157
Hey, Jake, man,
we can't have people

01:19:06.242 --> 01:19:08.076
puking in the locker room
before the game.

01:19:08.160 --> 01:19:10.080
God, what next?

01:19:10.204 --> 01:19:13.331
All right, tell 'im not to worry.
I'll think o' something. Come on.

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:16.214
Jake.

01:19:16.335 --> 01:19:18.628
Where's Vaughn?
Seen him around?

01:19:19.171 --> 01:19:22.882
If you do, tell him I'd like
to have a little talk with 'im.

01:19:29.348 --> 01:19:30.598
- Thanks, Pepper.
- Yeah.

01:19:30.683 --> 01:19:32.694
One whole chicken,
just like you said.

01:19:58.252 --> 01:19:59.335
Hello again,
everybody.

01:19:59.420 --> 01:20:02.130
Harry Doyle bidding you
a big Wahoo welcome

01:20:02.214 --> 01:20:03.798
from Municipal Stadium,

01:20:03.883 --> 01:20:06.314
where tonight,
before a capacity crowd

01:20:06.314 --> 01:20:09.386
of 75,000 screaming
feather-heads,

01:20:09.421 --> 01:20:11.556
the fighting braves
of the Cuyahoga

01:20:11.640 --> 01:20:14.142
will leave their teepees
in search of Cleveland's

01:20:14.226 --> 01:20:17.479
first league championship
in over 30 years.

01:20:17.563 --> 01:20:20.106
Standing in the way,
their long-time nemesis,

01:20:20.191 --> 01:20:21.608
the New York Yankees.

01:20:21.692 --> 01:20:24.360
Tryin' to put the stop on
the Yanks will be Eddie Harris,

01:20:24.445 --> 01:20:26.696
the tribe's veteran
right-hander.

01:20:26.780 --> 01:20:29.949
- Monte, anything to add?
- No.

01:20:30.034 --> 01:20:32.952
He's not the best colorman
in the league for nothing, folks.

01:20:33.078 --> 01:20:35.079
All right, we're set to go.

01:20:38.501 --> 01:20:40.502
- Are you ready?
- We're ready!

01:20:40.586 --> 01:20:42.629
Are you ready?
Let's take it to 'em!

01:21:15.579 --> 01:21:19.415
Two out in the first inning,
and Harris looking very sharp, so far.

01:21:19.500 --> 01:21:22.961
The sign from Taylor.
The target goes up, and the pitch.

01:21:24.129 --> 01:21:26.798
Here's a bouncer to third,
easy play for Dorn.

01:21:26.924 --> 01:21:30.802
Fires across to Metcalfe,
and the Yankees are gone in the first.

01:21:35.432 --> 01:21:36.516
Bottom of the third,

01:21:36.600 --> 01:21:39.394
Cerrano swings and misses
strike three.

01:21:40.729 --> 01:21:42.564
Springer leads away
from first.

01:21:42.648 --> 01:21:45.942
Harris comes to the plate,
Taylor, snap throw to first, got 'im!

01:21:46.443 --> 01:21:48.403
Springer is picked off.

01:21:49.113 --> 01:21:51.447
Jackson deals.
Hayes pops it up,

01:21:51.532 --> 01:21:54.492
and that will do it
for the Indians in the fourth.

01:21:55.411 --> 01:21:58.079
Harris delivers.
K-Y ball hit toward the hole.

01:21:58.163 --> 01:22:01.916
Hey, great stop by Dorn !
Throws in time, and he got him.

01:22:02.668 --> 01:22:04.919
A curve ball,
and down goes Cerrano again.

01:22:05.004 --> 01:22:06.337
Strike!

01:22:06.422 --> 01:22:09.090
Williams swings
and drives one deep.

01:22:10.634 --> 01:22:13.261
Back goes Hayes.
Way back to the wall.

01:22:13.345 --> 01:22:15.763
Jumps and makes
a great catch!

01:22:15.848 --> 01:22:19.142
Whoa, what a play, and the Yankees
are turned away in the sixth!

01:22:28.402 --> 01:22:31.404
Still nothing-nothing.
Top of the seventh, with two out.

01:22:31.488 --> 01:22:33.823
Harris has been in trouble,
but has battled his way out

01:22:33.907 --> 01:22:36.075
with the help of some
great defensive plays.

01:22:36.160 --> 01:22:38.578
All right,
here's Burton comin' on.

01:22:41.332 --> 01:22:45.168
Harris, from the stretch, is ready,
and here he comes to Burton.

01:22:45.252 --> 01:22:47.420
He swings and
drives one to right field.

01:22:47.504 --> 01:22:52.342
Uh-oh, this one is way back,
way back. It is off the reservation.

01:22:52.426 --> 01:22:56.387
A home run, and the Yankees
now lead two to nothing.

01:22:57.931 --> 01:22:59.932
That ought
to shut these people up.

01:23:00.017 --> 01:23:02.852
Well, the Indians have been
living dangerously all night,

01:23:02.936 --> 01:23:05.560
and Burton finally
burned them.

01:23:05.731 --> 01:23:07.482
One down,
bottom of the seventh.

01:23:07.566 --> 01:23:10.276
Taylor hits a ground ball to short.
Danello up with it.

01:23:10.361 --> 01:23:13.571
On to first in time,
and Taylor is hobbling a little

01:23:13.697 --> 01:23:15.907
as he goes back
to the dugout.

01:23:22.206 --> 01:23:24.457
<i>- Now batting, number 24.
- Go, Roger.</i>

01:23:25.292 --> 01:23:28.503
<i>Third baseman,
Roger Dorn.</i>

01:23:28.587 --> 01:23:31.506
Dorn up. Two men out,
bottom of the seventh.

01:23:31.590 --> 01:23:34.092
The Indians runnin'
out o' chances.

01:23:34.593 --> 01:23:36.302
Dorn off to
a slow start this year,

01:23:36.387 --> 01:23:40.556
has come on lately,
hitting 271 , with 86 RBIs.

01:23:40.641 --> 01:23:42.975
Here's the wind-up,
and the... pitch to him.

01:23:43.060 --> 01:23:46.521
And he... swings and drives
a base hit to left field.

01:23:50.025 --> 01:23:53.027
And the Indians have
a runner here with two men out

01:23:53.112 --> 01:23:55.780
on a sharp single
to left by Dorn.

01:23:56.281 --> 01:24:00.576
All right. That'll bring up Cerrano,
the big man, with two away,

01:24:00.661 --> 01:24:03.204
and he represents
the tying run.

01:24:03.288 --> 01:24:07.709
<i>Now batting, number 13,
Pedro Cerrano.</i>

01:24:07.793 --> 01:24:09.252
Cerrano hitless tonight.

01:24:09.336 --> 01:24:11.796
As a matter of fact,
he hasn't touched the ball yet.

01:24:12.131 --> 01:24:16.467
- Pedro! Pedro! Pedro!
- Pedro! Pedro! Pedro!

01:24:19.513 --> 01:24:21.723
Cerrano ready now.

01:24:21.807 --> 01:24:23.975
Here's the pitch.
Swings and misses.

01:24:24.059 --> 01:24:26.384
We should have gotten
a live chicken.

01:24:27.980 --> 01:24:30.398
Cerrano digging in.
Down a strike.

01:24:32.359 --> 01:24:34.902
Jackson gets his sign
and comes set.

01:24:35.112 --> 01:24:37.780
Checks Dorn at first.
Here's the pitch.

01:24:37.865 --> 01:24:39.991
A curve ball.
Swung on and missed.

01:24:40.075 --> 01:24:43.619
Strike two, and Cerrano
wasn't even close to that one.

01:24:44.997 --> 01:24:47.206
Pissed off now,
Jobu.

01:24:47.291 --> 01:24:50.001
Look, I good to you.
I stick up for you.

01:24:50.919 --> 01:24:52.837
If you no help me now,

01:24:54.381 --> 01:24:58.141
I say, fuck you, Jobu.
I do it myself.

01:25:09.521 --> 01:25:13.399
Jackson wants a new sign.
Now he's got what he likes.

01:25:15.944 --> 01:25:18.070
Here's the pitch to Cerrano.

01:25:18.489 --> 01:25:21.240
He swings and drives
one to deep left.

01:25:22.576 --> 01:25:25.536
Way back! Way back!
This ball is gone!

01:25:25.704 --> 01:25:26.888
Yeah!

01:25:50.938 --> 01:25:53.105
Jobu! Yes!

01:26:01.782 --> 01:26:03.616
Sit down, Charlie.

01:26:21.593 --> 01:26:23.553
Welcome to
the happy hunting ground !

01:26:23.637 --> 01:26:25.805
The Indians have tied it
at two

01:26:25.889 --> 01:26:29.156
on a two-run blast by Cerrano.

01:26:32.479 --> 01:26:35.231
Two outs, top of the ninth,
still tied at two.

01:26:35.315 --> 01:26:37.483
Harris, working
on a seven-hitter.

01:26:37.568 --> 01:26:40.194
Here's the pitch.
Saslow hits a long drive.

01:26:40.279 --> 01:26:43.072
This one's gonna get
over Cerrano's head and off the wall.

01:26:43.156 --> 01:26:46.868
Cerrano up with it.
Fires it back in, Marx digging for third.

01:26:46.952 --> 01:26:49.370
Saslow into second
with a standing double,

01:26:49.454 --> 01:26:51.873
and the Yankees have runners
at second and third,

01:26:51.957 --> 01:26:55.126
as Harris is now beginning
to show signs of fatigue.

01:26:55.419 --> 01:26:56.419
Shit!

01:26:57.254 --> 01:26:58.838
Get Vaughn up.

01:27:03.468 --> 01:27:05.845
Activity continues
in the bullpen.

01:27:06.096 --> 01:27:08.306
Harris is
in real trouble now.

01:27:08.765 --> 01:27:11.893
He got the first two hitters,
then gave up a single and a double,

01:27:11.977 --> 01:27:14.312
and has now gone
3 and 0 to Cheevers.

01:27:14.813 --> 01:27:18.232
Harris sets,
checks the runners.

01:27:18.317 --> 01:27:21.110
Comes to the plate.
High, ball four,

01:27:21.194 --> 01:27:23.946
and the bases are loaded,
and that's gonna bring up

01:27:24.031 --> 01:27:27.408
Clue Haywood, the biggest
Indian-killer of them all.

01:27:27.576 --> 01:27:29.577
Taylor and Brown
on their way to the mound,

01:27:29.661 --> 01:27:33.091
and this could be all for Harris.
He has pitched a beauty.

01:27:35.250 --> 01:27:37.934
How's it holding, Eddie?
You look a little tired.

01:27:38.337 --> 01:27:41.596
I'm throwing every piece of junk
I can think of at 'em, skipper.

01:27:41.840 --> 01:27:43.382
I got enough left
for one more hitter.

01:27:43.467 --> 01:27:45.217
Nah.
You pitched a hell of a game there.

01:27:45.302 --> 01:27:48.044
Take a seat, and we'll see
if we can get this guy out for you.

01:27:48.430 --> 01:27:50.681
- All right.
- Good game, Eddie.

01:27:51.099 --> 01:27:52.753
Give me Vaughn.

01:27:53.352 --> 01:27:54.727
You want Vaughn?

01:27:54.811 --> 01:27:56.520
I know he hasn't done
very well against this guy,

01:27:56.605 --> 01:27:58.731
but I got a hunch he's due.

01:27:59.566 --> 01:28:01.484
Good job. Good job.

01:28:21.880 --> 01:28:23.923
<i>Wild thing</i>

01:28:25.550 --> 01:28:27.426
<i>You make my heart sing</i>

01:28:27.511 --> 01:28:29.762
I hate this fuckin' song.

01:28:34.476 --> 01:28:36.644
<i>Come on, wild thing</i>

01:28:47.406 --> 01:28:50.741
<i>Wild thing,
I think I love you</i>

01:28:51.743 --> 01:28:54.912
<i>But I wanna know for sure</i>

01:29:04.798 --> 01:29:05.840
Okay, Ricky.

01:29:05.924 --> 01:29:08.384
Haywood likes the hard stuff
out over the plate,

01:29:08.468 --> 01:29:11.595
so bust him in,
and don't get up with anything.

01:29:12.472 --> 01:29:14.348
- You listening to me, Rick?
- Yeah.

01:29:14.433 --> 01:29:17.143
Okay, you're my man.
Go get 'im, kid.

01:29:19.730 --> 01:29:20.558
This guy's the out

01:29:20.558 --> 01:29:22.362
you've been waiting
your whole life for.

01:29:25.110 --> 01:29:27.111
<i>Wild thing</i>

01:29:28.363 --> 01:29:30.489
<i>Come on, wild thing</i>

01:29:31.533 --> 01:29:35.161
<i>Come on, come on,
come on, wild thing</i>

01:29:35.704 --> 01:29:37.788
<i>Shake it, shake it,
shake it, shake it</i>

01:29:37.873 --> 01:29:38.956
<i>Wild thing</i>

01:29:41.626 --> 01:29:43.961
<i>Come on, come on,
wild thing</i>

01:29:44.046 --> 01:29:47.840
So, a surprise move by Brown here,
bringing in the Wild Thing,

01:29:47.924 --> 01:29:51.637
who's been shelled
in two outings against the Yankees.

01:29:56.641 --> 01:29:58.684
Oh, shit.

01:30:07.819 --> 01:30:12.156
Let's cut through the crap, Vaughn.
I only got one thing to say to you.

01:30:14.534 --> 01:30:16.744
Strike
this motherfucker out!

01:30:29.257 --> 01:30:31.842
Okay, the conference
on the mound is over,

01:30:31.927 --> 01:30:33.844
and we are ready to go.

01:30:34.179 --> 01:30:39.183
<i>Now batting, number 6,
first baseman, Clue Haywood.</i>

01:30:44.147 --> 01:30:45.272
Haywood steps in,

01:30:45.357 --> 01:30:47.149
the American League's
Triple Crown winner.

01:30:47.234 --> 01:30:51.195
341 average,
48 homers, 121 RBIs.

01:30:51.279 --> 01:30:54.490
He's homered the only two times
he's faced Vaughn.

01:31:04.584 --> 01:31:07.017
All right, Ricky.
Let's get nasty.

01:31:08.922 --> 01:31:11.507
Haywood's set
at the plate.

01:31:12.175 --> 01:31:14.385
Vaughn, from the wind-up...

01:31:14.594 --> 01:31:16.137
Swing and a miss.

01:31:19.224 --> 01:31:20.766
That sucker was moving,
wasn't it?

01:31:20.851 --> 01:31:24.228
If it hit you, it'd leave
a two-foot hole comin' out.

01:31:26.398 --> 01:31:28.440
Okay, what shall we
call now?

01:31:28.525 --> 01:31:31.735
Let's see what the kid feels
about the old number one.

01:31:35.198 --> 01:31:38.325
Wild Thing delivers.
Strike two!

01:31:38.410 --> 01:31:39.952
Fuck!

01:31:45.375 --> 01:31:49.003
Forget about the curve ball, Ricky.
Give 'im the heater.

01:31:49.504 --> 01:31:52.381
Now, shit.
All these pitches to choose from.

01:31:52.507 --> 01:31:55.885
Maybe we ought to try
something different this time.

01:32:25.332 --> 01:32:28.209
- Got him swingin'!
- Strike three!

01:32:28.293 --> 01:32:30.920
All right, Ricky! Yeah!

01:32:42.474 --> 01:32:47.061
Oh, Lordy! Three straight heaters,
and the Yankees are blown down.

01:32:47.145 --> 01:32:50.314
No runs, two hits,
three left on.

01:32:50.398 --> 01:32:52.483
And are you ready,
Cleveland?

01:32:52.567 --> 01:32:55.819
We go to the Indian ninth
still tied at two.

01:32:56.780 --> 01:32:59.657
Can you believe this,
Monte?

01:33:02.285 --> 01:33:05.746
One down in the ninth.
Jackson delivers, Tomlinson swings

01:33:05.830 --> 01:33:07.790
and drives one deep
to right field !

01:33:07.874 --> 01:33:11.418
Back goes Worberg and
makes the catch against the wall.

01:33:11.503 --> 01:33:14.255
Tomlinson gave it a ride,
but came up short.

01:33:14.839 --> 01:33:17.758
That's gonna bring
a visit to the mound.

01:33:17.842 --> 01:33:21.345
And Horton wastin' no time.
He's goin' to the Duke.

01:33:25.433 --> 01:33:27.355
The Duke leads the league
in saves,

01:33:27.355 --> 01:33:30.020
strikeouts per inning
and hit batsmen.

01:33:30.105 --> 01:33:33.274
This guy threw at his own kid
in a father-son game.

01:33:33.358 --> 01:33:39.029
<i>Now batting, number double zero,
center fielder Willie Mays Hayes.</i>

01:33:39.114 --> 01:33:42.574
Two down now, as Hayes steps in,
hitting 291.

01:33:42.701 --> 01:33:45.619
Tryin' to get somethin' goin'
for the tribe.

01:33:46.538 --> 01:33:49.331
The Duke, who's been overpowerin'
down the stretch,

01:33:49.416 --> 01:33:53.085
has not been scored upon
in his last 16 appearances.

01:33:54.754 --> 01:33:59.008
The Duke ready now and delivers.
Here's a high chopper towards short.

01:33:59.384 --> 01:34:01.802
Danello charges.
Can he get him? No!

01:34:01.886 --> 01:34:03.637
- Safe!
- Hayes beat it!

01:34:11.521 --> 01:34:12.563
All right!

01:34:26.995 --> 01:34:30.622
- Goin' somewhere, meat?
- About 90 feet.

01:34:31.291 --> 01:34:35.711
Number 7,
catcher Jake Taylor.

01:34:42.177 --> 01:34:43.844
Taylor to the plate.

01:34:43.928 --> 01:34:46.847
He's 0 for 12
against the Duke, lifetime.

01:34:46.931 --> 01:34:49.641
The Duke has his sign
and is ready.

01:34:49.768 --> 01:34:51.352
Hayes with a good lead.

01:34:51.436 --> 01:34:53.604
- Go! Go! Go! Go!
- Go! Go! Go! Go!

01:35:00.236 --> 01:35:02.863
A quick move by the Duke,
and Hayes just beat it back.

01:35:02.947 --> 01:35:04.531
Safe!

01:35:16.294 --> 01:35:18.545
Hayes leads away again.

01:35:18.630 --> 01:35:21.382
Tie game, 2-2,
two outs in the ninth,

01:35:21.466 --> 01:35:22.841
and the winning run
at first.

01:35:22.926 --> 01:35:25.386
Hayes out
to a big lead now.

01:35:34.729 --> 01:35:36.563
Hayes goes!

01:35:41.778 --> 01:35:43.002
Come on!

01:35:45.365 --> 01:35:46.769
Come on, Willie.

01:35:47.450 --> 01:35:49.246
Here's the throw.

01:35:50.662 --> 01:35:51.912
- Safe!
- Yeah!

01:35:51.996 --> 01:35:53.122
Yeah!

01:35:58.920 --> 01:36:01.296
All right, Willie!
Way to go!

01:36:03.716 --> 01:36:07.052
- Whoo! All right!
- You, man! You, man!

01:36:10.181 --> 01:36:11.432
It's up to Taylor now,

01:36:11.516 --> 01:36:15.436
as the Indians have the winning run
in scoring position.

01:36:23.361 --> 01:36:25.362
That's
a hell of an idea.

01:36:26.380 --> 01:36:27.435
Tim!

01:36:45.884 --> 01:36:48.469
What's this?
Taylor is pointing to the bleachers.

01:36:48.553 --> 01:36:50.387
He's calling his shot.

01:36:52.932 --> 01:36:56.518
Nobody's done this since Babe Ruth
in the '32 World Series.

01:36:56.644 --> 01:36:59.605
Hayes leads from second,
as Duke takes his stretch.

01:36:59.689 --> 01:37:00.981
The pitch.

01:37:01.065 --> 01:37:03.984
Look out! Down goes Taylor!

01:37:09.616 --> 01:37:12.910
Come on, hairball!
Cut down on that shit, man!

01:37:12.994 --> 01:37:15.204
Bring that shit
to me, man.

01:37:15.288 --> 01:37:18.499
Taylor back up,
refusing to dust himself off

01:37:18.583 --> 01:37:21.585
after Duke gave him
a little chin music.

01:37:26.049 --> 01:37:28.008
Taylor's pointing again!

01:37:34.015 --> 01:37:34.998
Unbelievable.

01:37:34.998 --> 01:37:37.980
They're on their feet here,
stomping, clapping.

01:37:39.062 --> 01:37:41.438
Come on. Join in
wherever you are out there.

01:37:41.523 --> 01:37:42.940
Let's hear you,
Cleveland!

01:37:43.024 --> 01:37:45.317
- Go, go, go!
- Go, go, go!

01:37:56.621 --> 01:37:58.664
Taylor waits at the plate.

01:37:59.457 --> 01:38:02.417
The Duke at the belt.
Hayes away from second.

01:38:08.550 --> 01:38:11.510
Here comes the 1-1 pitch.

01:38:17.225 --> 01:38:18.737
Taylor bunts!

01:38:18.772 --> 01:38:19.685
Shit.

01:38:45.545 --> 01:38:46.670
Safe!

01:38:47.839 --> 01:38:51.216
Hayes around third!
He's gonna try to score!

01:38:53.011 --> 01:38:55.095
Here comes the throw.

01:38:58.349 --> 01:39:01.476
He slides! He is...

01:39:01.978 --> 01:39:03.228
Safe! Safe!

01:39:03.855 --> 01:39:06.064
And the Indians win it!
The Indians win it!

01:39:06.149 --> 01:39:08.692
Oh, my God!
The Indians win it!

01:39:23.166 --> 01:39:25.083
I can't believe it!

01:39:51.319 --> 01:39:53.111
We did it! We did it!
