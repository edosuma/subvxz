01:49.505 --> 01:53.100
- Don't answer it.
- I have to. It's football season.

01:53.305 --> 01:56.695
Oh, come on. There is no game tonight.

01:57.145 --> 01:59.295
- Paulie, what's up?
- Forget that.

01:59.505 --> 02:03.464
- I was making cheese dogs for you.
- Why, what's going on?

02:03.665 --> 02:05.462
Okay.

02:05.665 --> 02:07.098
All right.

02:07.304 --> 02:08.853
I'll be there.

02:09.065 --> 02:10.782
Chrissy!

02:12.985 --> 02:15.374
It was a bitch getting off work.

02:16.105 --> 02:19.495
- Adriana, I think this could be it.
- What?

02:19.705 --> 02:24.938
He told me to meet him at Modell's.
He told me to shine my shoes.

02:25.505 --> 02:29.293
Oh, my God. Christopher!

02:30.065 --> 02:34.502
Find a matching shirt and tie.
Not the camellia. Paulie has one.

02:34.705 --> 02:38.857
I can't believe it. I mean,
I knew it would happen, but...

02:39.065 --> 02:43.024
So now can we get out of here?
Get a big loft, maybe?

02:43.665 --> 02:46.941
- You're giving notice today.
- You wish.

02:50.905 --> 02:53.578
The wife of a made guy
doesn't hostess.

02:53.785 --> 02:56.663
I'm so proud of you.

02:56.865 --> 03:00.175
- I love you, Christopher.
- You better.

03:11.545 --> 03:15.094
- What?
- I don't know.

03:15.305 --> 03:21.653
You getting called like this and going
off all happy. I worry, that's all.

03:22.625 --> 03:24.616
You've seen too many movies.

03:38.625 --> 03:40.934
- How you doing, kid?
- Good.

03:41.385 --> 03:43.580
No, no, no. Ride up front.

03:43.785 --> 03:45.935
Where we going?

03:47.225 --> 03:50.820
You look good. Shoot your cuffs.

03:58.025 --> 04:00.414
Where we going, Sil?

04:02.545 --> 04:04.263
Here he is.

04:06.825 --> 04:09.055
So this is it.

04:09.265 --> 04:11.301
All right.

04:11.505 --> 04:16.339
He sat on one ass cheek
the whole way over!

04:17.265 --> 04:20.620
- Too many movies, is his problem.
- I didn't sit funny.

04:20.904 --> 04:25.501
All right. Let's get started. Come on.

04:30.545 --> 04:33.503
All right, finish up over there.

04:33.705 --> 04:35.377
You know why we're here.

04:35.585 --> 04:39.021
So if you've got any doubts
or reservations, say so.

04:39.225 --> 04:41.659
No one will think any less of you.

04:42.065 --> 04:46.695
Because once you enter this family,
there's no getting out.

04:46.905 --> 04:50.420
This family comes before
everything else. Everything.

04:50.825 --> 04:55.421
Before your wife, your children,
your mother and your father.

04:55.625 --> 04:57.695
It's a thing of honor.

04:57.905 --> 05:00.624
If something happens
and you can't earn...

05:00.825 --> 05:03.703
...we'll take care of you.
That's part of it.

05:03.905 --> 05:07.614
If you got a problem,
you just gotta let somebody know.

05:07.825 --> 05:11.022
This man right here,
he's like your father.

05:13.585 --> 05:16.941
No matter if it's with somebody here
or outside...

05:17.465 --> 05:21.094
...you bring it to him,
he'll solve it.

05:21.345 --> 05:25.224
You stay within the family.

05:26.425 --> 05:29.337
All right, give me your hand.

05:50.505 --> 05:51.733
Okay.

05:52.185 --> 05:55.734
That's St. Peter, my family saint.
As the card burns...

05:55.945 --> 06:00.018
...so may your soul, if you
betray your friends in the family.

06:02.665 --> 06:06.738
Now rub your hands together like this
and repeat after me.

06:06.945 --> 06:09.823
- May I burn in hell...
- May I burn in hell...

06:10.025 --> 06:14.496
...if I betray my friends.
...if I betray my friends.

06:17.905 --> 06:19.338
Congratulations.

06:46.105 --> 06:49.893
- My heart's pounding.
- You done good with the sports book.

06:50.185 --> 06:54.542
- Yeah, it's been good.
- I'm gonna give it to you. It's yours.

06:54.745 --> 06:58.863
- I was wondering what it was gonna be.
- You're a made guy now.

06:59.065 --> 07:02.740
It's your turn to make real money,
and I get to relax.

07:02.945 --> 07:07.894
Your only problem is to give me 10
points of the take each settle-up day.

07:08.305 --> 07:10.694
Other than that, you got no problem.

07:10.905 --> 07:16.104
My only problem in life? I gotta kick
my points to that man over there.

07:16.665 --> 07:19.577
And onward goes this thing of ours.

07:19.785 --> 07:23.334
When you think of all the
headaches people have...

07:23.545 --> 07:26.742
...ours are boiled down to one.
Not a bad deal.

07:26.945 --> 07:31.814
- You got it.
- There's a six-G minimum every week.

07:32.025 --> 07:37.145
I gotta get something out of this.
Six grand could be a lot or a little.

07:37.345 --> 07:40.655
Depends on you, and how
much you grow the business.

07:40.865 --> 07:44.141
I love you, Paulie.
We're in it together now.

07:44.585 --> 07:47.179
I love you too, kid.

07:50.985 --> 07:54.341
Anything on the Newark
Riverfront Esplanade project?

07:54.545 --> 07:57.537
My guy says the matching funds
are close.

07:57.745 --> 08:02.341
They added plans for a Newark
Museum of Science and Trucking.

08:02.705 --> 08:05.583
More cement. More everything.

08:06.705 --> 08:09.538
Answer the fucking thing.

08:10.385 --> 08:12.740
So you feeling okay?

08:12.945 --> 08:16.540
You mean about my mother?
Well, what're you gonna do?

08:16.745 --> 08:20.784
- You pick up the pieces and go on.
- I meant your spells.

08:20.985 --> 08:22.657
They're not spells.

08:22.865 --> 08:24.981
How do you know about that?

08:25.185 --> 08:28.143
Everyone knows.
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

08:28.345 --> 08:31.701
- Julius Caesar was an epileptic.
- I'm not epileptic.

08:31.905 --> 08:35.614
Whatever it is, take care of yourself.
It's your health.

08:35.825 --> 08:39.340
- Is the psychiatrist helping?
- You know about that?

08:39.544 --> 08:42.105
There's no stigmata these days.

08:42.304 --> 08:45.263
My kid saw one
for that thing with his wife.

08:45.465 --> 08:48.457
- They're happy now.
- What about privacy?

08:49.025 --> 08:52.779
Our family's done business a long time
with the Sopranos.

08:52.985 --> 08:58.855
Peacefully and profitably. I wanna
keep it like that. Take care of this.

08:59.065 --> 09:03.183
- All right, Carmine.
- Be a better friend to yourself.

09:03.385 --> 09:06.695
I will.
I appreciate your concern. Really.

09:14.185 --> 09:18.064
Jayne was determined to "bust"
into the business, so to speak.

09:18.265 --> 09:23.214
Hollywood folklore has it that she
called Paramount Pictures and said:

09:23.425 --> 09:27.577
"My name's Jayne Mansfield
and I wanna be a movie star."

09:27.785 --> 09:31.334
You got a phone call
from some young kid.

09:31.825 --> 09:35.818
- Drew. Asked when you were going home.
- How'd he sound?

09:36.025 --> 09:38.823
Like he was about 15 years old.

09:39.025 --> 09:45.260
- Wait. Is that your so-called fiancÃ©?
- He's 19, and he can go all night.

09:47.305 --> 09:50.377
When are you going back to Seattle,
Janice?

09:50.585 --> 09:54.464
It depends on how long it takes
to settle Ma's estate.

09:56.465 --> 10:01.414
Estate? A falling-down house
and some old-lady underwear.

10:01.625 --> 10:06.380
- Sad, isn't it? What it all comes to.
- You know how much we love you.

10:06.585 --> 10:09.258
And you know we love
having you around.

10:09.465 --> 10:14.414
But there's a big house over there.
And I know you want maximum value.

10:14.625 --> 10:21.019
So for security, or so it don't fall
into disrepair, you could stay there.

10:21.265 --> 10:25.497
I been thinking the same. I just
don't wanna push Svetlana out.

10:25.865 --> 10:30.416
I talked to her. She's moving out
tomorrow, maybe the next day.

10:30.625 --> 10:33.093
- Really?
- Yeah.

10:33.385 --> 10:35.262
Great.

10:38.385 --> 10:40.819
I better go pack.

11:05.385 --> 11:08.218
Jesus Christ! Let me come around.

11:08.425 --> 11:10.700
How you doing, Roy?

11:11.785 --> 11:14.015
Congratulations.

11:14.225 --> 11:18.264
Large Old Blue Eyes for this
gentleman. Soft drinks of choice.

11:18.465 --> 11:20.183
Look.

11:24.545 --> 11:27.981
- Without Tony, he's a zero with shoes.
- He wears a stripe.

11:28.185 --> 11:31.655
- My uncle Richie was gonna...
- Yeah, but he never did.

11:41.465 --> 11:44.775
- Chris. My propers.
- Dino.

11:44.985 --> 11:47.021
Hey, Benny.

11:50.985 --> 11:53.260
Congratulations.

11:53.545 --> 11:57.584
- When did you get out, Benny?
- D.A. tossed it. Witness bailed.

11:57.785 --> 12:01.095
- Jackie, how's Rutgers?
- Fuck it. I'm dropping out.

12:01.305 --> 12:03.341
Come on. "Boola Boola."

12:03.545 --> 12:07.902
We were talking about our former
school. They got the coffeehouse.

12:08.105 --> 12:11.654
It's a pure cash operation.
The beauty part is...

12:12.225 --> 12:16.013
...I mean, who's gonna stop you?
Kids? Campus security?

12:16.225 --> 12:19.979
What are you telling him about that?
That's ours.

12:23.465 --> 12:26.980
- Watch where the fuck you're going!
- Kiss my ass!

12:27.185 --> 12:30.495
Take it outside!
Don't disrespect the pizza parlor.

12:30.705 --> 12:34.584
- Asshole! I know where you live!
- You hear what I said?

12:39.665 --> 12:42.623
Good talking to you, Chris.
Keep Dino in mind.

12:42.825 --> 12:47.740
Not to be an asshole, but I can't
be seen in a place like this anymore.

12:57.785 --> 12:59.013
All right.

12:59.905 --> 13:03.215
This has gotta start showing results,
or end.

13:03.425 --> 13:07.464
I talked to a business associate
about these panic attacks.

13:07.665 --> 13:11.021
Enough fucking around.
Enough money in your pocket.

13:11.225 --> 13:13.944
What's the story here?

13:14.905 --> 13:19.581
The latest treatment of Panic Attack
Syndrome is a three-part approach.

13:19.785 --> 13:20.854
It's a syndrome?

13:21.065 --> 13:24.296
Medication for depression,
psychotherapy...

13:24.505 --> 13:27.178
...and cognitive behavioral therapy.

13:27.385 --> 13:28.864
You're on medication.

13:29.305 --> 13:32.502
If you feel ready, you could
see a behaviorist.

13:33.025 --> 13:38.145
- You mean talk to somebody else?
- You seem unhappy with my approach.

13:39.105 --> 13:43.383
If you're really ready to commit to
mental health, I say great.

13:43.585 --> 13:46.383
Let's get going, I'm ready to help.

13:47.025 --> 13:50.301
But we'll have to delve deeper. Focus.

13:52.545 --> 13:55.184
This latest incident, for starters.

13:56.265 --> 13:59.098
All right. Fine.

14:02.545 --> 14:05.378
My daughter brought home a black.

14:05.745 --> 14:10.375
They were on the couch, watching TV.
Snuggling.

14:12.945 --> 14:15.015
And?

14:15.785 --> 14:20.984
She went upstairs, and I had a
frank conversation with Buckwheat.

14:21.185 --> 14:24.461
I told him to stay the fuck
away from my daughter.

14:24.665 --> 14:28.499
And she came downstairs and they left.

14:29.985 --> 14:31.657
Then you had the attack?

14:32.145 --> 14:38.220
Not right then. I went to the kitchen
for a sandwich, opened the cabinet...

14:38.425 --> 14:41.735
...I saw a box of Uncle Ben's rice.
Boom!

14:41.945 --> 14:44.539
I see. The rice logo.

14:45.105 --> 14:50.384
The first onset of hyperventilation,
that occurred upon seeing the rice?

14:54.265 --> 14:58.338
No. I was taking the capocollo
and shit out of the fridge.

14:58.545 --> 15:04.017
I'm thinking when you first came here,
the panic attacks with ducks...

15:04.225 --> 15:07.979
...as I remember it,
you were grilling meat, weren't you?

15:08.185 --> 15:10.221
The memory on you.

15:10.425 --> 15:14.384
- Sausages, wasn't it?
- Sausages. Steaks. Yeah.

15:14.585 --> 15:18.863
Wow. Let's get back
to that capocollo.

15:19.305 --> 15:23.696
I gotta take that. My busy season.

15:25.625 --> 15:27.217
Yeah?

15:27.425 --> 15:29.336
Fifty?

15:29.785 --> 15:32.140
That's pretty rich for one game.

15:32.745 --> 15:35.020
If he's good for it, take it.

15:35.225 --> 15:38.456
But keep me posted on
Duke-Wake Forest.

15:38.825 --> 15:40.497
All right.

15:44.745 --> 15:46.337
Sorry.

15:47.425 --> 15:49.143
Where were we?

15:49.865 --> 15:53.335
The connection between
your anxiety attacks and meat.

15:53.545 --> 15:55.024
Right.

15:56.505 --> 15:58.894
What was it again?

15:59.905 --> 16:02.465
Closing Ohio State.
They're kicking off.

16:02.665 --> 16:06.294
- Who you like? lowa?
- No difference, as long as it pays.

16:06.585 --> 16:09.463
Chris, fuck. Oregon vs. USC?

16:09.665 --> 16:13.260
I told you we should have
laid off some of that action.

16:13.465 --> 16:18.061
Spread's 11. Oregon's down by 12,
they're on the 45, no timeouts.

16:18.265 --> 16:21.496
Oregon's got an
All-American field-goal kicker.

16:21.705 --> 16:23.980
Why didn't somebody tell me?

16:24.225 --> 16:26.785
- See?
- And it's good!

16:27.505 --> 16:29.860
Forty-three yarder.

16:30.065 --> 16:33.774
That spread could've opened at 18,
fucking top 10 team!

16:33.985 --> 16:37.660
We should have laid off some.
Paulie did it all the time.

16:37.865 --> 16:40.174
You see him here?

16:41.265 --> 16:45.258
What's the matter with you people?
Answer the fucking phones!

16:48.865 --> 16:52.175
- Minor setback, that's all.
- Oh, yeah?

16:52.385 --> 16:55.695
- The frost is on the pumpkin.
- Supposed to warm up.

16:55.905 --> 16:58.055
Good football weather.

16:58.545 --> 17:01.264
Mom said she's waiting for the meat.

17:01.465 --> 17:03.979
- Did Jackie Jr. show?
- I don't know.

17:04.185 --> 17:09.498
- Little fuck promised he'd be here.
- Watch your mouth in front of my kid.

17:11.105 --> 17:15.576
Probably keeping a booth warm
at the O.F., him and Dino Zerilli.

17:19.145 --> 17:23.502
What's he doing? I told his father
I'd try to keep him out of this.

17:23.704 --> 17:26.538
- He's the heir apparent.
- Not this kid.

17:26.744 --> 17:29.703
Do me a favor.
Watch out for Jackie, okay?

17:29.905 --> 17:32.942
You ought to turn that one link there.

17:34.905 --> 17:36.623
Little setback, huh?

17:39.425 --> 17:43.179
Ro, your kid's late.
It's rude, he should be set straight.

17:43.385 --> 17:46.980
He'll be here. I paged him.
The poor kid lost his dad.

17:47.185 --> 17:49.301
I lost mine when I was 6.

17:49.505 --> 17:53.418
Ralph had to drop out of 11 th grade
to raise his siblings.

17:53.625 --> 17:55.741
You'd never know it.

17:55.945 --> 18:00.780
I'm Satan to this kid,
just because I'm in love with his mom.

18:01.145 --> 18:04.979
- What are we talking about?
- The cheerleaders. Any hotties?

18:05.185 --> 18:08.495
There's no cheerleaders
for freshman ball.

18:09.065 --> 18:13.024
These are Mario Batali's string beans,
with Parmesan.

18:19.905 --> 18:22.465
- You are very late, young man.
- It's me.

18:22.665 --> 18:24.576
- Meadow! Hi, babe.
- Who is it?

18:24.785 --> 18:28.664
- It's Meadow. What are you doing?
- Nothing. What's going on?

18:28.865 --> 18:31.902
- Well, Sunday dinner.
- Yeah?

18:32.105 --> 18:35.381
- Wanna talk to your dad? He's outside.
- Burning a cross?

18:35.905 --> 18:39.580
I don't know what you mean,
but it's not the proper time.

18:39.825 --> 18:43.500
- Your brother wants to talk to you.
- No, I don't.

18:45.265 --> 18:47.495
- Hello?
- Hi. What's up?

18:47.705 --> 18:51.015
- Everybody's here. It's boring.
- Is that Jackie?

18:51.225 --> 18:55.104
It's not him.
It's Meadow, from school.

18:55.305 --> 18:58.263
Hold on, call waiting. Hello?

18:58.465 --> 19:00.342
- My mother there?
- Yeah.

19:01.265 --> 19:04.814
Aunt Ro? Yeah, I gotta go.

19:05.505 --> 19:07.302
Thank you.

19:08.225 --> 19:10.534
- Where are you?
- I can't make it.

19:10.745 --> 19:15.535
- We're all waiting. You promised.
- Fuck it.

19:23.065 --> 19:25.898
The way he talks to me...

19:27.105 --> 19:30.415
I'll bring it up to Tony,
maybe he'll talk to him.

19:44.345 --> 19:46.256
Paulie?

19:54.705 --> 19:56.821
What time is it?

19:57.025 --> 20:02.577
That's almost all of it. Warren
probably told you about Oregon-USC.

20:04.785 --> 20:07.060
- This is unacceptable.
- It's $4000.

20:07.265 --> 20:11.702
- I'll have the rest in a few days.
- I thought I made myself clear.

20:11.905 --> 20:16.456
Fucking college ball.
But I learned a valuable lesson.

20:18.265 --> 20:20.221
I'm not running a school, kid.

20:20.585 --> 20:23.497
Paulie, this is me.
You know I'm good for it.

20:23.705 --> 20:27.664
Don't drag in our friendship.
You work for me.

20:27.865 --> 20:30.220
- I want to...
- Shut up and listen.

20:30.425 --> 20:32.222
I'll give you a few days...

20:32.425 --> 20:36.862
...but it'll cost another two G's
as a reminder not to fuck it up.

20:37.065 --> 20:39.374
I make myself clear?

20:40.265 --> 20:44.975
And don't give me the malocchio.
I'm not the one with the short bag.

20:54.385 --> 20:59.698
Any word from your lvy Leaguer?
How's Carm with the empty nest?

20:59.905 --> 21:04.023
Empty? Meadow's always home
with laundry or hauling food out.

21:04.225 --> 21:06.693
All that talk, she didn't go far.

21:06.905 --> 21:10.693
We created too nice a home life.
They don't want to go.

21:10.905 --> 21:16.138
But if they're closer to us than we
were to our parents, is that bad?

21:23.785 --> 21:26.219
- What time is it?
- I'm here, aren't I?

21:26.425 --> 21:30.657
- Out of respect to my father.
- I gotta make two phone call.

21:30.865 --> 21:32.856
Sit down.

21:40.305 --> 21:43.502
- Want something to eat?
- I'm not hungry.

21:44.105 --> 21:47.302
That's too bad. I said lunch meeting.

21:47.865 --> 21:50.095
You want a drink?

21:56.985 --> 21:59.180
Lose the glasses.

22:04.025 --> 22:06.493
I'm gonna say a few things.

22:07.385 --> 22:12.823
I'm gonna say some bad words,
and you're gonna have to deal with it.

22:13.265 --> 22:17.019
I know what you think.
You think I clipped your uncle.

22:17.225 --> 22:21.298
You'd be a shithead
to believe I didn't do it.

22:21.505 --> 22:23.541
But I didn't.

22:25.145 --> 22:28.182
And I got some bad news for you.
Look at me.

22:28.945 --> 22:30.822
Look at me.

22:33.785 --> 22:36.299
- Your uncle was a rat.
- No fucking way!

22:37.265 --> 22:39.984
Sit down. Sit the fuck down.

22:44.705 --> 22:48.300
He was a rat. He's in the
Witness Protection Program.

22:48.585 --> 22:54.899
- That's my father's brother.
- I'm a member of your family, almost.

22:55.665 --> 22:59.340
You think I'm the only one
that knows this about Richie?

22:59.545 --> 23:04.335
You ask anybody. This hurt all of us.

23:12.745 --> 23:15.054
Jesus Christ.

23:15.265 --> 23:18.337
Your dad and me,
you know how close we were?

23:19.505 --> 23:24.135
He never wanted this for you.
He wanted you to be a doctor.

23:24.505 --> 23:26.097
Give me a fucking break.

23:26.305 --> 23:31.220
Let me tell you something. Besides the
money, doctor's a powerful position.

23:31.425 --> 23:33.017
I'm no doctor.

23:33.225 --> 23:37.377
Know how hard you have to work
to get your MD? How many years?

23:37.585 --> 23:41.897
I was thinking osteopathy,
but I don't have the grades for that.

23:42.105 --> 23:44.983
You're not gonna drop out of Rutgers?

23:45.465 --> 23:48.662
No. But those premed courses
almost killed me.

23:48.865 --> 23:51.743
I only did it because my dad was sick.

23:51.945 --> 23:56.461
But you should know
he never wanted this life for you.

23:56.665 --> 24:01.102
And I'll tell you something.
I don't want it for my son, either.

24:03.865 --> 24:09.098
Come on! Let's go, I wanna see
you hit them! Get off the ball!

24:14.905 --> 24:19.456
Fourth and three and this cetriolo is
going for it? With that offense?

24:19.665 --> 24:21.860
Why's my kid still on the bench?

24:22.065 --> 24:26.263
The coach will let him in.
They all get to play one quarter.

24:26.465 --> 24:28.581
Pucillo in for Sposato!

24:28.785 --> 24:31.345
Pucillo played already!
Put my kid in!

24:34.105 --> 24:35.254
It's the rules.

24:40.265 --> 24:42.574
I told you they wouldn't make it.

24:42.785 --> 24:46.300
Are you fucking crazy, ref?
What?

24:46.505 --> 24:49.019
What did you say?
Come here and say it!

24:49.225 --> 24:52.297
- Romano. The periodontist.
- Get off the field!

24:52.505 --> 24:54.541
I'll rip your heart out!

24:54.745 --> 24:58.420
- Look. Anthony's going in.
- All right, A.J.!

25:02.345 --> 25:04.336
Okay, defense, 41 stack.

25:04.545 --> 25:08.982
- A.J.! Stick 'em, baby!
- Stick 'em! Do it!

25:11.265 --> 25:13.256
- Fumble!
- Fumble!

25:15.465 --> 25:17.820
Up! Up! Everybody up! Wait, get up.

25:44.945 --> 25:48.779
It's A.J.! Yeah!
Yeah! Good job, A.J.!

25:48.985 --> 25:51.215
Good job, good job. Yeah!

25:52.185 --> 25:54.221
Hey! Hey!

25:54.425 --> 25:56.575
That's my son.

25:59.265 --> 26:02.894
You got a nose for the ball,
and that can't be taught.

26:03.105 --> 26:06.541
But you gotta have leverage
and footwork.

26:06.745 --> 26:11.216
I remember hitting that sled
till my shoulder was raw.

26:11.425 --> 26:13.655
But then you reward yourself.

26:13.865 --> 26:17.016
So I'll take you to Stewart's
and buy some dogs.

26:17.225 --> 26:19.102
I just wanna go home.

26:19.305 --> 26:23.139
You should be riding high
after what you did on the field.

26:23.345 --> 26:26.417
Wanna play some Nintendo? You and me?

26:26.625 --> 26:29.458
When are you gonna toss that
out the window?

26:29.665 --> 26:33.977
- Why?
- Well, all right. Play Nintendo.

26:35.985 --> 26:38.374
Okay, let's go to Stewart's.

26:38.905 --> 26:40.702
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

26:51.305 --> 26:54.934
- Yeah?
- I need you home, Tony, for dinner.

26:55.145 --> 26:58.342
- Now? It's our busiest season.
- I know.

26:58.545 --> 27:03.096
It's important that we not turn
into a family who eats at the counter.

27:03.385 --> 27:05.137
All right. I'll be there.

27:07.785 --> 27:10.219
Pass the potatoes, please.

27:11.905 --> 27:15.102
Anthony? The potatoes?

27:16.105 --> 27:18.539
- Sorry.
- Every night.

27:20.305 --> 27:22.899
Go ahead. Pour yourself another glass.

27:23.105 --> 27:26.654
You need good bones
for those open field tackles.

27:29.665 --> 27:33.294
So.
How was everybody's day today?

27:33.505 --> 27:34.938
Busy.

27:39.225 --> 27:43.013
Nana was asking me where
you might want to go to college.

27:43.225 --> 27:44.977
- I don't know.
- West Point.

27:45.265 --> 27:47.495
- West Point?
- That's what you said.

27:47.705 --> 27:50.299
- No, I didn't.
- Oh, yeah, you did.

27:50.505 --> 27:56.216
- You said Harvard or West Point.
- I'd never say that. I'd never get in.

28:02.225 --> 28:04.534
- Can we eat with the TV on?
- No.

28:09.065 --> 28:11.818
I gotta take that. My busy season.

28:14.825 --> 28:16.178
Mom there?

28:16.385 --> 28:18.501
Hey, how are you?

28:18.705 --> 28:20.457
Is Mom there?

28:20.665 --> 28:24.624
- Yeah, she's here. How's school?
- Fine.

28:24.825 --> 28:26.781
Is Mom there?

28:29.745 --> 28:33.533
- Is that Meadow? Can I talk?
- Yeah, you can have her.

28:34.465 --> 28:36.183
Hello?

28:37.185 --> 28:40.222
Did you hear what happened
to Bobby Capodianco?

28:51.945 --> 28:54.584
I feel bad. Taking your old room.

28:54.785 --> 28:57.936
Don't worry about it.
You're all settled in.

28:58.145 --> 29:01.057
You could sleep in your mother's room.

29:01.265 --> 29:03.540
- Pass.
- Won't be for long.

29:03.745 --> 29:10.139
Bill's children go to live with their
mother, end of week. I stay with him.

29:13.385 --> 29:17.219
A few days is not a problem.
I'm glad I can help you out.

29:17.425 --> 29:21.657
God knows my brother used to sleep
like a dead man in there.

29:23.225 --> 29:26.422
I'm sorry about how I behaved
at the cemetery.

29:26.625 --> 29:29.981
Janice. I cannot give records back.

29:30.505 --> 29:32.143
I wish you'd reconsider.

29:32.345 --> 29:37.499
I know Livia left no will,
but possession is 9/10 of law.

29:37.705 --> 29:39.980
Let's not descend into that.

29:40.265 --> 29:44.577
Feeling in me is,
she is not here to ask.

29:44.785 --> 29:49.256
I know. I'm sorry.
This is an emotional issue for me.

29:49.465 --> 29:52.662
I thought that if we
could talk one-on-one...

29:52.865 --> 29:57.416
...I could make you understand
how much those records mean to me.

29:58.265 --> 30:01.098
Just promise me you'll sleep on it.

30:22.225 --> 30:25.262
It was that fucking bird
in the window!

30:25.505 --> 30:28.463
It was a coincidence.

30:28.665 --> 30:33.455
I was making good jack!
Now everything turns to shit?

30:33.665 --> 30:38.785
The bird thing is if it's in the
house. And that's death, not bad luck.

30:38.985 --> 30:43.501
- Will your mother loan me money?
- She's paying for her hysterectomy.

30:43.705 --> 30:49.814
- Where's that bracelet I got you?
- Get rid of that stupid Range Rover!

30:51.065 --> 30:53.215
I'm sorry.

30:54.665 --> 30:57.862
Jesus-fucking-Christ.

31:25.145 --> 31:30.060
Janice! Janice! Janice!

31:38.785 --> 31:41.379
Janice! Janice!

32:07.625 --> 32:13.541
- The fuck is this? You owe me $300!
- I ain't using. Chris, I got mugged...

32:14.225 --> 32:16.864
That's it! I want my money!

32:18.625 --> 32:20.263
Fuck!

32:40.265 --> 32:43.701
- Janice call yet?
- No.

32:47.465 --> 32:48.784
Hello, Tony.

32:50.625 --> 32:54.220
- How have you been?
- What is she doing here?

32:54.465 --> 32:59.141
She brings old leg.
Piece of shit, made in Russia.

32:59.345 --> 33:03.020
I have losted weight,
cannot wear it no more.

33:03.225 --> 33:05.819
Only an hour, then starts to hurt.

33:06.025 --> 33:10.223
- I'm getting married. Did you know?
- You told me.

33:11.145 --> 33:16.742
- Wish you all the best.
- She put into my Sprite three Halcyon.

33:17.025 --> 33:18.743
I miss you so much, Tony.

33:18.945 --> 33:22.574
Let's stick to the subject.
Your cousin's missing a leg.

33:22.785 --> 33:27.336
$20,000. That's what it cost,
leg she took.

33:27.545 --> 33:31.094
Flex foot, latest technology
with vertical shock pylon.

33:31.905 --> 33:34.214
Plus, calfskin boot.

33:35.065 --> 33:37.295
Kenneth Cole.

33:37.945 --> 33:44.339
You don't even want to talk to me.
I don't see why we can't be friends.

33:44.585 --> 33:49.181
I don't even know what I'm doing here,
except you worked it this way.

33:50.505 --> 33:53.975
- We could have talked on the phone.
- I'm sorry, Tony.

33:54.185 --> 33:55.982
It's not your fault.

33:56.465 --> 33:58.774
Look, I'm sorry about your leg.

33:59.625 --> 34:02.093
I'll reach Janice.

34:02.945 --> 34:06.824
- Janice put any food in there?
- No, but I have orange juice.

34:07.025 --> 34:09.493
Plus there are two Miller Genuines.

34:09.705 --> 34:14.255
And your mother's meat delivery
still is coming every week.

34:51.505 --> 34:54.143
Southern California vs. Notre Dame.

34:54.344 --> 34:57.894
We're in Indiana
on a perfect football afternoon.

34:58.105 --> 35:00.414
- See you next week.
- Thank you.

35:01.505 --> 35:06.135
- I was just gonna call you, Johnny.
- Oh, yeah?

35:08.345 --> 35:12.133
- Someplace we can talk in private?
- I'm kind of busy.

35:12.345 --> 35:14.495
Gonna call.

35:15.225 --> 35:16.738
Now you're busy.

35:16.945 --> 35:21.336
- Something I could get you, Junior?
- No, I'm good.

35:24.345 --> 35:26.540
It'll just take a minute.

35:27.545 --> 35:31.060
Anthony, I told you
to wait in the car!

35:35.345 --> 35:38.223
Listen to your old man, Anthony.

35:41.945 --> 35:45.381
So, what were you gonna call me about?

35:45.705 --> 35:47.058
I don't got it.

35:48.665 --> 35:50.144
Weasely son of a bitch!

35:50.345 --> 35:53.303
Can't make payments?
See me. Work out a plan.

35:53.505 --> 35:56.941
- I swear, a vendor owes me $300.
- Shut the fuck up!

35:57.305 --> 36:02.425
Your wife's weekly order's ready.
It's gotta be $30 worth of meat there.

36:02.625 --> 36:05.219
Capocollo, chops
and a standing roast.

36:05.425 --> 36:08.701
You gonna backtalk me?
Junior, get him over here.

36:08.905 --> 36:11.578
No, wait, please!
What are you gonna do?

36:17.345 --> 36:20.496
Anthony, what did I fucking tell you?

36:24.425 --> 36:27.974
What, your father never cut off
anybody's pinky?

36:31.065 --> 36:35.502
That's traumatic for anyone
to witness, much less an 11 -year-old.

36:35.705 --> 36:37.297
Actually, it wasn't.

36:39.505 --> 36:42.577
It was a rush,
if you want to know the truth.

36:43.265 --> 36:47.497
- You want me to delve?
- Go on.

37:01.225 --> 37:03.102
Dinner's ready.

37:07.505 --> 37:09.223
Come here.

37:10.465 --> 37:13.104
Come on, I wanna talk to you.

37:22.625 --> 37:27.619
What you seen today, Anthony,
a very sad thing.

37:27.825 --> 37:32.694
You disobeyed your old man,
and I ought to give you the belt.

37:33.505 --> 37:35.655
But I gotta say that...

37:37.385 --> 37:42.539
...a lot of boys your age would have
run like a girl. But you stayed.

37:44.745 --> 37:48.704
I know you like Mr. Satriale.
We all do. He's a lovely man.

37:48.985 --> 37:52.534
The man is a gambler.

37:53.105 --> 37:57.542
He got over his head in debt.
He owed me money and refused to pay.

37:57.745 --> 37:59.224
He avoided me.

38:00.705 --> 38:04.937
That's why you should never gamble,
Anthony.

38:09.065 --> 38:11.260
What was I supposed to do?

38:11.585 --> 38:16.613
That's my livelihood.
It's how I put food on the table.

38:17.505 --> 38:21.020
You should never gamble, Anthony.

38:22.185 --> 38:28.374
Johnny, dinner's ready! Anthony!
Janice, turn that off.

38:28.625 --> 38:31.185
Let this be a lesson to you.

38:31.385 --> 38:35.424
A man honors his debts.

38:40.465 --> 38:42.183
Beautiful cut he sent.

38:42.385 --> 38:45.377
You like it standing
with the bone in, Lee?

38:45.625 --> 38:48.264
Look at those juices.

39:06.865 --> 39:08.423
Go, Wayne Newton.

39:22.105 --> 39:24.096
Can I have the end piece?

39:25.545 --> 39:28.184
Johnny, let's eat
while it's still hot.

39:28.705 --> 39:34.337
You bet, baby.
The lady loves her meat.

39:48.425 --> 39:50.541
Four stitches. Ruined dinner.

39:50.745 --> 39:55.341
- This was your first panic attack?
- Fainted, my old man called it.

39:55.545 --> 39:59.424
Obviously, we've finally touched
on something here.

39:59.625 --> 40:03.903
What you witnessed that day.
Where the meat came from.

40:04.105 --> 40:06.744
And your mother's
great pleasure in it.

40:06.945 --> 40:09.903
It was the one time
she'd be in a good mood...

40:10.105 --> 40:13.302
...when the weekly delivery
from Satriale's came.

40:13.505 --> 40:15.939
Or Fusco, the vegetable man, maybe.

40:16.145 --> 40:19.615
Probably the only time
the old man got laid.

40:19.865 --> 40:22.743
- Probably.
- Pretty sick, huh?

40:22.945 --> 40:25.413
Getting turned on by free cold cuts?

40:25.625 --> 40:28.822
Did your mother question
why the meat was free?

40:29.025 --> 40:32.062
Meat that was going
into her children's mouths?

40:32.265 --> 40:34.620
I don't know. I don't wanna know.

40:34.825 --> 40:37.419
I don't wanna think about any of it.

40:37.625 --> 40:43.222
I'm sure it was too much for you then
too. That's why you short-circuited.

40:43.425 --> 40:48.783
Puberty. Witnessing not only your
mother and father's sexuality...

40:48.985 --> 40:53.183
...but also the violence and blood
so closely connected...

40:53.385 --> 40:56.183
...to the food you were about to eat.

40:56.385 --> 40:59.297
And also, the thought that someday...

40:59.505 --> 41:03.544
...you might be called upon
to bring home the bacon.

41:03.745 --> 41:07.499
- Like your father.
- All this from a slice of capocollo?

41:08.025 --> 41:11.620
Kind of like Proust's madeleines.

41:11.825 --> 41:14.293
- What?
- Marcel Proust.

41:14.505 --> 41:18.896
Wrote a seven-volume classic,
Remembrance of Things Past.

41:19.105 --> 41:21.539
He took a bite of a madeleine.

41:22.025 --> 41:26.143
It's a kind of tea cookie
he used to have as a child.

41:26.345 --> 41:31.499
And that one bite unleashed a tide
of memories of his childhood...

41:31.705 --> 41:34.424
...and ultimately of his entire life.

41:34.985 --> 41:38.341
This sounds very gay.
I hope you're not saying that.

41:38.545 --> 41:40.342
No.

41:41.785 --> 41:46.905
Understanding root causes makes you
less vulnerable to future episodes.

41:47.265 --> 41:49.825
My fucking head is swimming here.

41:50.025 --> 41:55.304
We're gonna have to stop.
It's a lot to process.

41:55.625 --> 41:59.538
But we've made real progress today.
Good work.

42:00.625 --> 42:05.255
And I'd really like you to write down
any thoughts or associations.

42:08.425 --> 42:09.858
See the left tackle?

42:10.065 --> 42:13.580
He fakes inside,
and then gets a spin move on the guy.

42:13.785 --> 42:16.697
Now he's charging the quarterback.
See?

42:16.905 --> 42:21.774
- I thought the tailback had it.
- You gotta keep your eye on the ball.

42:22.545 --> 42:24.934
- Okay, I'm going.
- Where?

42:25.145 --> 42:29.582
I gotta bring Med her biking shoes,
she's been missing my braciole.

42:29.985 --> 42:33.182
- Can I come?
- Hey, we're watching the game.

42:33.385 --> 42:35.979
I can catch the game in the car.

42:36.505 --> 42:39.383
It's nice he wants
to visit his sister.

42:40.265 --> 42:44.099
- You're right. I'll get my shoes.
- Why not watch your game?

42:44.305 --> 42:46.865
What, I shouldn't go now?

42:47.345 --> 42:51.099
A.J., why don't you bring this stuff
out to the car?

42:57.825 --> 43:01.977
This is about Sambo, right?
I'm paying for that goddamn college.

43:02.185 --> 43:06.781
I don't know what's going on.
But if you want to make a scene...

43:06.985 --> 43:10.944
...then comb your hair and come along.
Embarrass her.

43:11.145 --> 43:14.421
Alienate her.
Or better yet, cut her off.

43:14.625 --> 43:18.982
Let her drop out and go to a state
school. Or move back in here.

43:21.465 --> 43:27.461
I was just trying to protect her from
herself. And I'll do that till I die.

43:31.065 --> 43:35.217
I'm not gonna tell you you can't come.
She's your daughter.

43:38.785 --> 43:41.299
I'll probably watch the game.

44:07.945 --> 44:12.416
Garcia handing off at the 40-yard line
across to the 43.

44:13.345 --> 44:16.462
I got your favorite
Santa Barbara olives.

44:16.945 --> 44:19.539
Leave me the fuck alone.

44:25.585 --> 44:31.182
Go for the touchdown. I need another
five points to cover the spread.

44:34.265 --> 44:36.540
Hi. Pardon me.

44:37.265 --> 44:40.621
Here she is. Come on.
Meadow!

44:41.305 --> 44:43.375
We're here.

44:46.425 --> 44:49.701
- This is my mom and my brother, A.J.
- Hey.

44:49.905 --> 44:53.693
- Dad didn't come?
- No, he didn't. Did you want him to?

44:57.465 --> 45:00.980
- Noah, would you mind?
- Noah told me what Dad said.

45:01.185 --> 45:06.179
- It's out in the open, so fuck this.
- Let's watch the latrine-lip.

45:07.185 --> 45:09.494
Oh, what'd Dad say?

45:09.705 --> 45:14.256
Anthony, wait for me downstairs.
I want to talk to your sister.

45:15.385 --> 45:19.060
- Oh, I know what he said.
- Go.

45:20.985 --> 45:25.581
I'm always being sent away.
Why do I bother going anywhere?

45:27.465 --> 45:30.821
- What did your father say?
- Like he didn't tell you.

45:31.345 --> 45:35.463
- Believe what you like...
- He called Noah things so ugly...

45:35.665 --> 45:37.383
...I can't even repeat it.

45:38.825 --> 45:43.296
- You're right. There's no excuse.
- He's lucky I didn't punch him out.

45:43.505 --> 45:47.544
- Because you're civilized.
- So this was gonna be a big drama?

45:47.745 --> 45:51.624
You wanted your father
to subject your friend to this again?

45:51.985 --> 45:54.340
Wait. So I'm in the wrong?

45:54.545 --> 45:57.537
The rest of the world
should work around...

45:57.745 --> 46:01.533
...his racist, retrograde,
fucking-asshole personality?

46:01.745 --> 46:06.500
He's from a place and a time where
he thinks it's in your best interest.

46:06.705 --> 46:10.141
New Jersey? The third millennium?

46:10.345 --> 46:12.176
Noah, you know what I mean.

46:12.385 --> 46:16.617
Coming from a racially-mixed marriage
must have been a burden.

46:16.865 --> 46:21.097
Don't slam his background.
Look what you wound up in!

46:21.905 --> 46:25.215
Excuse us, Noah.
I want a word with my daughter.

46:25.425 --> 46:28.542
I'm not going anywhere
unless she wants me to.

46:29.385 --> 46:32.343
It's okay.
I'll be up in a little while.

46:54.625 --> 46:58.379
I'd hate to think you're airing
family business in public.

46:58.585 --> 47:02.544
Noah's not stupid.
It took him a while, but he caught on.

47:02.745 --> 47:05.657
He keeps his opinions to himself.

47:05.865 --> 47:09.653
Unlike some people,
he's brilliant and sensitive.

47:09.865 --> 47:11.457
I'll keep my mouth shut.

47:11.665 --> 47:15.499
Anything I say to you,
or your father, will just fuel this.

47:15.705 --> 47:18.617
I'm not gonna stop seeing Noah.

47:18.985 --> 47:24.696
I put your helmet there. Though I'd
rather you not bike in the city.

47:24.905 --> 47:28.693
If you must know, I'm going to
Litchfield, Connecticut...

47:28.905 --> 47:34.138
...to the weekend home of Noah's
parents' friends, who work at NBC.

47:48.025 --> 47:51.540
- but Hegel is talking about...

48:08.025 --> 48:11.301
- Svetlana, get out here!
- Oh, hi.

48:11.505 --> 48:14.383
You must be the famous Bill.
Moving day, huh?

48:14.585 --> 48:19.136
I didn't think you would have
the nerve to show your face to me.

48:19.345 --> 48:23.941
- Why? What's wrong?
- Don't bullshit me. Where is my leg?

48:24.145 --> 48:28.502
- Your leg? Oh, yeah, where's your...?
- I know you took it.

48:28.705 --> 48:31.378
That's preposterous.
How could I use it?

48:31.585 --> 48:36.136
You think that will make me give
records back, but you're wrong.

48:36.345 --> 48:40.623
If you see a karmic connection
between my mother's records...

48:40.825 --> 48:43.020
...and your missing leg, wow!

48:43.225 --> 48:47.537
The records return, and so does
the leg. I see how you got there.

48:48.065 --> 48:50.420
How do you live with yourself?

48:50.625 --> 48:53.219
Bill, don't waste breath.

48:53.425 --> 48:57.703
This cunt is gonna be sorry
she ever fuck with me.

48:58.905 --> 49:04.741
You better hope you have all your
shit, 'cause I'm calling the locksmith.

49:10.505 --> 49:13.224
Doc. Where's Dino?

49:13.665 --> 49:16.737
They got him for possession.
What do you care?

49:16.945 --> 49:20.574
He mentioned a job at Rutgers.
A coffeehouse.

49:20.785 --> 49:26.542
Coffeehouse, shit. We were gonna
jack a benefit concert there tonight.

49:26.745 --> 49:31.216
- Can you make it work without Dino?
- It was my fucking idea.

49:42.745 --> 49:45.305
I know this must be hard, Anthony.

49:45.505 --> 49:49.418
Your sister off at college,
you all by yourself with us.

49:49.625 --> 49:51.775
But it won't be for long.

49:51.985 --> 49:55.421
Soon, you'll be heading
off to college yourself.

49:55.665 --> 49:59.453
- I don't think I'm gonna go.
- College? Of course you will.

50:00.425 --> 50:03.223
I don't wanna talk about it right now.

50:04.025 --> 50:08.143
There's so many people, all smarter
than me. A bunch of freaks.

50:08.345 --> 50:09.937
What?

50:13.865 --> 50:16.333
You're not excused!

50:16.545 --> 50:21.221
- You're punished!
- He's all right. Lascia lui.

50:29.705 --> 50:33.061
Move this car and your life
will not be worth shit.

50:33.265 --> 50:35.017
Get me Jewel's autograph.

50:35.225 --> 50:38.979
You're a good kid.
I'll bring you her underpants.

50:47.145 --> 50:50.103
- All goes in there, no one gets shot.
- Oh, my God!

51:02.465 --> 51:06.378
- You're robbing a benefit concert.
- Is that all there is?

51:06.985 --> 51:11.024
- Most people used student cards.
- Hey! What's going on, you?

51:11.265 --> 51:14.974
Say one word on that fucking thing
and you're dead!

51:27.545 --> 51:28.580
Hit it!

51:53.145 --> 51:55.375
There's your money.

51:59.425 --> 52:03.384
- You ought to hit a tanning salon.
- I had a late night.

52:04.225 --> 52:05.658
Give that shit a rest.

52:05.865 --> 52:08.584
Man needs his seven hours
to keep sharp.

52:08.785 --> 52:13.779
This was work. Little Jackie hyped us
to a score at Rutgers, not bad.

52:13.985 --> 52:16.943
What's the matter, Chrissy?
Tell Uncle Paulie.

52:17.145 --> 52:21.058
Being made isn't like I thought.
A lot of responsibilities.

52:21.345 --> 52:25.099
- What did you think?
- You're as smart as the week's lines.

52:25.305 --> 52:28.661
One mistake and you're chasing,
not making, money.

52:28.865 --> 52:32.255
Welcome to the NFL, rookie.
Go home, get some sleep.

52:32.465 --> 52:34.820
Tomorrow's a new day.

52:44.985 --> 52:48.614
Sorry I'm late.
I had to make a few stops.

52:49.305 --> 52:52.980
- Have a smelt.
- No.

52:53.185 --> 52:55.904
We had a very good week
this week, boss.

52:57.665 --> 53:01.055
- How's our little friend doing?
- He had some knocks.

53:01.265 --> 53:02.744
Came out all right.

53:02.945 --> 53:05.743
Wait'll he hears the policy
on newly-made guys.

53:05.945 --> 53:08.937
They're subject to strip search
for wires.

53:09.145 --> 53:11.340
He'll love that.

53:11.545 --> 53:16.096
He had to augment his kick with a
stickup little Jackie put him onto.

53:16.305 --> 53:18.500
Jackie Aprile?

53:18.865 --> 53:22.653
- He did the thing in the papers?
- He was only the wheel man.

53:22.865 --> 53:28.303
- I told Christopher to leave him out.
- I'm just telling you what I know.

53:42.265 --> 53:46.019
Don't be too hard on him.
He's having a hard enough time.

53:46.225 --> 53:49.376
What's wrong with him?
When's he gonna grow up?

53:50.545 --> 53:52.581
- Where's Soprano?
- Here.

53:52.785 --> 53:58.735
Guys, take a good look at Soprano and
remember his performance last week.

53:58.945 --> 54:03.461
He's on the sidelines three quarters,
waiting. Does his mind go soft?

54:03.665 --> 54:06.975
No. Does his fire go out? Heck, no.

54:07.185 --> 54:09.904
When the call came,
he brought his A game.

54:10.105 --> 54:13.063
He may have a big future.
He may be a leader.

54:13.425 --> 54:18.021
That's what it takes. And that's
why I'm naming him defensive captain.

54:21.385 --> 54:26.254
All right! So let's hit those showers,
one thought in mind...

54:26.465 --> 54:29.298
Soprano! Soprano, you all right?

55:54.345 --> 55:55.334

[ENGLISH]

57:46.671 --> 57:49.583
Ton, will you get that?

57:52.871 --> 57:54.907
- Hello.
- Tony, it's me.

57:56.231 --> 57:58.586
Don 't hang up.

57:59.071 --> 58:01.631
You know who could answer this phone?

58:01.831 --> 58:06.268
Please. You're so conceited.
Do you think I want to call you?

58:06.471 --> 58:09.986
You're drinking and dialing.
I can smell the Stoli.

58:10.191 --> 58:13.786
Yell to your sister, not to me.
My poor cousin...

58:13.991 --> 58:16.221
...has not had her prosthetic leg.

58:16.431 --> 58:19.150
- What do you want me to do?
- Tony, please.

58:19.351 --> 58:23.583
I miss you so much.
Can't you come over here?

58:23.791 --> 58:26.589
Don't you ever call here again.

58:30.191 --> 58:33.388
- Didn't you see my favorite patient?
- Tomorrow.

58:33.591 --> 58:36.901
- How's that going?
- Let's not, Richard.

58:37.111 --> 58:40.501
- I wish you hadn't taken him back.
- I took you back.

58:40.711 --> 58:44.340
I see the synergy.
Treat him, we start seeing each other.

58:44.551 --> 58:46.906
- Richard, Richard.
- No, seriously.

58:47.111 --> 58:50.786
If you want to know, he had
a breakthrough last week.

58:50.991 --> 58:55.781
- What? Through somebody's jaw?
- You're right, I'm wasting my time.

58:56.031 --> 58:59.706
Better I boycott with
the Italian American Foundation...

58:59.911 --> 59:05.110
...and save the world from
what is it this week? Gangster?

59:05.471 --> 59:10.670
The idea ABC would think of producing
that stereotypical goombah fest.

59:10.871 --> 59:16.025
Richard, we are an advertisement for
the American experiment. We did great.

59:16.231 --> 59:21.385
I'm fed up with people assuming I'm a
thug because my name ends in a vowel.

59:21.631 --> 59:25.021
Undershirts, yelling.
Hollywood gives sociopaths...

59:25.231 --> 59:27.791
...the tragic grandeur of Al Pacino.

59:27.991 --> 59:31.267
He's an expert at this.
The guy's conning you.

59:31.751 --> 59:36.950
Condescend to me, Richard.
It gets me so hot.

59:37.471 --> 59:41.623
Tell me about this breakthrough.
You said he's alexithymic.

59:41.831 --> 59:43.230
Nothing will get through.

59:43.431 --> 59:47.947
Not if it threatens that straw house
he's built inside his head.

59:48.151 --> 59:53.066
It concerns me you don't see this.
Pink-slip this guy. He's dangerous.

59:53.271 --> 59:56.343
I'll pink-slip you if
you don't do the chicken.

01:00:00.151 --> 01:00:02.187
Is that new?

01:00:03.351 --> 01:00:05.945
- Looks good.
- Did you bring your log?

01:00:07.631 --> 01:00:11.829
- My log?
- Remember? You were to keep a record.

01:00:12.031 --> 01:00:14.386
I asked you to write feelings...

01:00:14.631 --> 01:00:18.544
...of anxiety or memories
of past anxiety attacks.

01:00:18.751 --> 01:00:21.549
My parents and the pork store. I know.

01:00:21.751 --> 01:00:25.380
That was... it was interesting.

01:00:26.271 --> 01:00:29.820
Have you thought at all about that?

01:00:30.071 --> 01:00:33.347
- How do people find the time?
- To get well?

01:00:37.391 --> 01:00:42.021
Look, my mother's dead.
I haven't had a panic attack since.

01:00:42.271 --> 01:00:46.901
You've gone without them before.
The conflicts that cause them...

01:00:47.111 --> 01:00:51.389
...and your depression are
buried deep inside you.

01:00:52.671 --> 01:00:55.981
- Are you happy?
- Am I happy?

01:00:56.831 --> 01:01:00.983
That's not even...

01:01:01.231 --> 01:01:05.986
Look, I'm sorry
I didn't bring the list.

01:01:06.191 --> 01:01:08.580
I'll bring it next week.

01:01:11.391 --> 01:01:15.384
Will you ever think about
bringing your wife into this?

01:01:15.591 --> 01:01:17.707
In here? Carmela?

01:01:17.911 --> 01:01:21.790
You're the one who wanted to take
a proactive approach.

01:01:21.991 --> 01:01:24.903
That's not in the future.

01:01:25.151 --> 01:01:30.350
Let's talk frankly.
You demanded more of me. Fine.

01:01:31.551 --> 01:01:34.588
- But you're not trying.
- I know.

01:01:34.791 --> 01:01:36.986
The past.

01:01:38.431 --> 01:01:42.583
But shit happens in my daily
life that needs attention now.

01:01:42.791 --> 01:01:45.942
I got some genuine concerns, you know.

01:01:46.151 --> 01:01:50.383
About my son. He shies away
from anything that requires effort...

01:01:50.591 --> 01:01:53.105
...and I think he picks
that up from me.

01:01:53.311 --> 01:01:57.509
He's in football now. Carmela's as
guilty about this as I am.

01:01:57.711 --> 01:01:58.860
She indulges him.

01:02:01.071 --> 01:02:02.823
Richard was right.

01:02:03.071 --> 01:02:06.825
I've been charmed by a sociopath.
Why didn't I listen?

01:02:07.031 --> 01:02:08.259
Why do you think?

01:02:08.471 --> 01:02:11.861
Why did I reject Richard
in the first place?

01:02:12.071 --> 01:02:15.143
If you think about my life,
it's so textbook.

01:02:15.351 --> 01:02:17.660
Marry a man 10 years my senior.

01:02:17.871 --> 01:02:22.308
Of course Richard's gonna be
protective and patriarchal.

01:02:22.551 --> 01:02:25.270
Then I reject him for being just that.

01:02:25.471 --> 01:02:28.622
There's nothing wrong
with wanting to be safe.

01:02:28.831 --> 01:02:32.870
I know Richard's right.
I should get Tony Soprano...

01:02:33.231 --> 01:02:34.380
Shit.

01:02:34.591 --> 01:02:39.790
I always thought it was that
other guy. Little Augie Aprile.

01:02:40.991 --> 01:02:45.382
- I can't believe I revealed his name.
- Why did you?

01:02:47.231 --> 01:02:49.586
Does Richard know who he is?

01:02:49.831 --> 01:02:54.586
I think he saw it in my Day-Timer.
That's why he's been so adamant.

01:02:54.831 --> 01:02:57.629
Because Soprano is very high up.

01:02:57.831 --> 01:03:00.903
If he was some button man
you wouldn't treat him?

01:03:01.111 --> 01:03:03.181
Please, with the terminology.

01:03:03.391 --> 01:03:08.590
You know psychotherapy is limited
in the treatment of anxiety disorder.

01:03:09.471 --> 01:03:14.420
You've medicated Soprano and helped
him gain insight he's able to absorb.

01:03:14.671 --> 01:03:18.789
It's time to send him
on to a behaviorist.

01:03:35.071 --> 01:03:36.982
Janice!

01:03:47.271 --> 01:03:48.784
Janice.

01:03:52.551 --> 01:03:54.030
I was cleaning up.

01:03:54.271 --> 01:03:56.421
When did you change the locks?

01:03:56.671 --> 01:04:00.300
The minute that Ukrainian dye-job
was out the door.

01:04:01.431 --> 01:04:03.899
Don't mess with the Russians, Janice.

01:04:04.151 --> 01:04:08.383
She can have her leg when
she returns Ma's record collection.

01:04:08.591 --> 01:04:13.745
- You would've done the same thing.
- I'm getting calls from her cousin.

01:04:13.951 --> 01:04:16.101
Miss Carburetor Works of 1987?

01:04:16.311 --> 01:04:19.587
Don't fuck with me on this.
Give back the leg.

01:04:19.831 --> 01:04:24.461
Tony, those records are yours too.
It's sad that you don't care.

01:04:24.671 --> 01:04:29.870
Those old albums...
They're a window into Ma's soul.

01:04:30.391 --> 01:04:33.303
In fact, I'm making a documentary.

01:04:34.231 --> 01:04:37.701
World War II generation's music,
exemplified by Ma.

01:04:37.911 --> 01:04:41.790
Who are you kidding?
You're gonna sell them on the Internet!

01:04:41.991 --> 01:04:44.630
- I have work to do.
- Cleaning the cellar.

01:04:44.871 --> 01:04:49.069
Good luck finding gold.
You'd make money working a real job.

01:04:49.271 --> 01:04:55.141
Like the minute I'm out you won't have
contractors tearing apart the walls.

01:04:55.351 --> 01:04:57.945
Oh, Janice.

01:05:13.151 --> 01:05:17.827
You finished? I wanna meet my bud at
the gym, we're gonna spar.

01:05:19.671 --> 01:05:21.980
You got a girlfriend?

01:05:23.311 --> 01:05:28.146
You know who's turning into a little
mink, though? Meadow Soprano.

01:05:28.351 --> 01:05:30.023
Look at him perk up.

01:05:30.231 --> 01:05:33.826
- I've known her since we were kids.
- Speaking of them...

01:05:34.031 --> 01:05:36.306
You did a stickup with Chris?

01:05:36.511 --> 01:05:39.947
I wanted to fly to South Beach.
Mom wouldn't pay.

01:05:40.151 --> 01:05:42.460
Don't worry. I'm won't tell her.

01:05:43.071 --> 01:05:45.027
Look, kid...

01:05:45.271 --> 01:05:48.900
I'm trying real hard here.

01:05:49.671 --> 01:05:51.343
I know it's tough on you.

01:05:51.551 --> 01:05:54.782
- I'm the guy that's dating your mom.
- Dating?

01:05:55.031 --> 01:05:57.784
Don't get fucking filthy about it.

01:05:59.831 --> 01:06:02.106
Anyway this...

01:06:02.311 --> 01:06:05.940
This was a good idea she had,
us going out to dinner.

01:06:06.151 --> 01:06:09.507
Not that one conversation
solves anybody's problems.

01:06:09.751 --> 01:06:14.586
I'm only here so I don't have
to hear her bitching and crying.

01:06:15.951 --> 01:06:17.987
The gym, huh?

01:06:22.871 --> 01:06:25.783
Mind if I make a stop first?

01:06:33.631 --> 01:06:36.099
My brother is out.
He said you knew.

01:06:36.311 --> 01:06:38.188
I get the bad-tempered one.

01:06:38.431 --> 01:06:41.628
Bashir said that this
payment would be late...

01:06:41.831 --> 01:06:43.947
...because we had truck problems.

01:06:44.151 --> 01:06:46.619
Three of them needed new hydraulics.

01:06:46.831 --> 01:06:49.903
- Nobody talked to me.
- He said you approved.

01:06:50.151 --> 01:06:53.905
You're collecting on my routes.
You gotta pay me.

01:06:54.111 --> 01:06:56.466
Only because you say they are.

01:06:56.671 --> 01:07:01.745
You wanna question New Jersey business
practice that goes back 70 years?

01:07:03.591 --> 01:07:05.582
What is this, Ralphie?

01:07:05.791 --> 01:07:08.942
I ought to stick a shish kebab
up your ass.

01:07:09.631 --> 01:07:12.099
Why do you provoke me?

01:07:12.351 --> 01:07:14.581
This young buck.

01:07:16.191 --> 01:07:19.069
He'll fuck your wife until she moans.

01:07:20.471 --> 01:07:24.020
- You fucking wop. You began it.
- What did you call me?

01:07:24.231 --> 01:07:26.825
- Bringing my wife in this!
- Put it down!

01:07:27.031 --> 01:07:28.783
- Mister, come on!
- Hey!

01:07:30.031 --> 01:07:32.226
- Get the fucking bat!
- Let go!

01:07:34.191 --> 01:07:36.182
- You all right?
- Asshole!

01:07:36.391 --> 01:07:39.508
School this prick.
In the breadbasket!

01:07:40.671 --> 01:07:45.187
Good, kid. Introduce him to his desk.

01:07:47.071 --> 01:07:49.710
Take an anger management course.

01:07:49.911 --> 01:07:51.424
Fucking racial slurs.

01:07:51.671 --> 01:07:54.390
Why you doing this to me?

01:07:59.871 --> 01:08:02.988
That's what you get for using
a baseball bat.

01:08:08.871 --> 01:08:10.987
Let's go, kid.

01:08:25.791 --> 01:08:30.182
- Yeah?
- Ginny. It's Tony Soprano.

01:08:30.911 --> 01:08:36.109
What's wrong with me? I'm a mess here
with the moving. I'll get John.

01:08:38.350 --> 01:08:43.185
John! John, get down here!
You got company!

01:08:43.390 --> 01:08:45.381
Look who's here.

01:08:45.631 --> 01:08:48.828
- The guinea welcome wagon.
- This is for you.

01:08:49.031 --> 01:08:53.468
Carmela's bringing something nice to
the housewarming for Ginny.

01:08:56.151 --> 01:08:59.700
This is the Great Room.
I don't see what's so great.

01:08:59.951 --> 01:09:03.738
It's mediocre. We got a
living room right over there.

01:09:05.631 --> 01:09:07.701
I didn't know you were moving.

01:09:07.911 --> 01:09:12.859
Ginny wanted to be near her sisters,
you know and the schools out here.

01:09:13.470 --> 01:09:17.180
We were with Carmine.
You never mentioned this place.

01:09:17.390 --> 01:09:19.506
It's not his favorite subject.

01:09:19.751 --> 01:09:23.460
It's what, half an hour,
40 minutes over the bridge?

01:09:24.071 --> 01:09:26.301
Why didn't you say you were moving?

01:09:26.551 --> 01:09:28.906
- Why?
- I gotta find out second hand?

01:09:29.151 --> 01:09:31.823
You care?
You working in a tollbooth?

01:09:32.031 --> 01:09:35.501
Besides, I already got
the condo in Point Pleasant.

01:09:36.151 --> 01:09:39.029
- You should have told me.
- I'm telling you now.

01:09:39.231 --> 01:09:43.702
This is a place to live. I got no
intention of sticking my beak in.

01:09:43.911 --> 01:09:48.223
I mean, there's our family
and then there's the Soprano family.

01:09:49.631 --> 01:09:52.099
Don't I get to see the rest of this?

01:09:52.310 --> 01:09:54.950
You can help me unstick
this rain bird.

01:09:55.151 --> 01:09:58.746
I'm a stranger in
a strange land out here.

01:10:09.871 --> 01:10:12.590
Look at this pair.

01:10:12.951 --> 01:10:16.023
How many Neapolitans
to screw in a light bulb?

01:10:16.271 --> 01:10:21.345
There's only candles in Naples.
The cardinal controls that racket.

01:10:21.551 --> 01:10:23.587
That's a good one.

01:10:23.831 --> 01:10:25.787
Use it on your paesans.

01:10:25.991 --> 01:10:30.189
We don't have those bulb jokes.
They don't translate.

01:10:31.111 --> 01:10:33.944
Tony, I go get a cappuccino.

01:10:34.151 --> 01:10:36.221
Two thousand of that is mine.

01:10:36.431 --> 01:10:39.423
Sand monkey on 17 is
holding out on us.

01:10:39.671 --> 01:10:43.505
- So you put his brother in an ambulance?
- He said a bad word.

01:10:43.751 --> 01:10:47.664
Why would you take Jackie's kid
on something like that?

01:10:47.871 --> 01:10:51.386
He's got to know how it works.
Kid's got a chip.

01:10:51.591 --> 01:10:53.741
23 and still living at home?

01:10:53.951 --> 01:10:57.910
So he can keep an eye on
the prick that's banging his mom.

01:10:58.591 --> 01:11:01.742
No matter how nice I am,
he still hates me.

01:11:01.951 --> 01:11:05.261
I got a daughter that age.
It's all a mystery.

01:11:05.471 --> 01:11:06.506
Amen.

01:11:06.751 --> 01:11:09.868
Being a parent,
that's the hardest job.

01:11:10.071 --> 01:11:12.221
It's harder than this other shit.

01:11:12.431 --> 01:11:18.222
- Like my first marriage and my kid...
- I got news you're not gonna like.

01:11:18.431 --> 01:11:22.390
- I'm putting him in as captain.
- What?

01:11:25.071 --> 01:11:27.221
No.

01:11:29.751 --> 01:11:32.902
- Fucking Gigi, are you shitting me?
- I'm sorry.

01:11:33.871 --> 01:11:38.581
This shit with the Arab?
I went too far. I'll take care of it.

01:11:38.791 --> 01:11:40.190
This isn't the first.

01:11:40.391 --> 01:11:45.590
At least tell the truth. You want your
own there to spy on the Aprile crew.

01:11:45.791 --> 01:11:48.021
Yeah. But I shouldn't have to.

01:11:48.671 --> 01:11:52.459
You got bad tendencies.
I sympathize because I do too.

01:11:52.671 --> 01:11:56.380
You partnering with
Joe Brooklyn on shit at the port.

01:11:56.591 --> 01:11:57.740
A bum decision.

01:11:57.951 --> 01:12:00.909
The bottom line speaks.
I'm earning my ass.

01:12:01.151 --> 01:12:03.187
It's my decision.

01:12:03.871 --> 01:12:08.865
Jesus Christ, Ton.
I eat dinner at your house.

01:12:09.071 --> 01:12:11.585
This is business.

01:12:18.071 --> 01:12:21.188
See? Turned it off.

01:12:22.191 --> 01:12:25.627
I've been thinking about
your course of therapy.

01:12:25.831 --> 01:12:27.981
You're the doctor.

01:12:29.551 --> 01:12:33.430
You're ready to move on to
behavior modification therapy.

01:12:33.831 --> 01:12:36.982
What's that mean?
Talk to somebody else?

01:12:37.791 --> 01:12:41.579
Is this because of what
happened last time?

01:12:42.951 --> 01:12:47.900
Look, I'm sorry. But like you said,
it's hard to think about that stuff.

01:12:48.111 --> 01:12:51.501
- It took how long to even remember?
- I realize that.

01:12:51.711 --> 01:12:56.102
You know, you're unbelievable.
I ask you to get serious in here.

01:12:56.311 --> 01:13:00.190
When it gets hard,
you pawn me off on somebody else.

01:13:03.191 --> 01:13:08.185
I'm just introducing the idea.
Something for you to think about.

01:13:08.391 --> 01:13:13.590
I'm going to bring in things for you
about behavior modification therapy.

01:13:17.351 --> 01:13:19.819
Yes, he was here earlier today.

01:13:20.031 --> 01:13:23.990
Yes, we talked about
behavior mod, but...

01:13:24.191 --> 01:13:27.183
Maybe you could.

01:13:27.631 --> 01:13:30.589
Listen, I told you
I would discharge him...

01:13:30.791 --> 01:13:35.182
...and I will, in my own good time.

01:13:35.431 --> 01:13:40.141
I'm going into the garage.
I'm gonna lose you. See you later.

01:13:49.351 --> 01:13:51.387
Shut up. Don't turn around.

01:13:51.591 --> 01:13:55.345
I said, shut up. I got a knife.
I'll cut you, bitch.

01:13:56.471 --> 01:13:58.189
Help!

01:13:59.671 --> 01:14:02.424
- Get off!
- Shut up!

01:14:06.351 --> 01:14:09.980
- I'll give you all my money.
- Get in!

01:14:12.511 --> 01:14:15.708
- No!
- Shut up!

01:14:15.911 --> 01:14:17.788
- Get the panties off.
- Stop!

01:14:17.991 --> 01:14:22.382
- I'm gonna fuck you, bitch!
- No!

01:14:24.591 --> 01:14:28.106
Please! No!

01:14:28.871 --> 01:14:31.590
You fucking bitch!

01:14:34.631 --> 01:14:39.147
Stop it!

01:14:57.191 --> 01:15:00.786
She's almost done.
We just need a few more swabs.

01:15:02.071 --> 01:15:05.620
- For God's sake, Jen.
- Richard.

01:15:09.591 --> 01:15:12.105
You're gonna be all right.

01:15:12.351 --> 01:15:15.229
I thought that I broke my leg...

01:15:15.471 --> 01:15:20.670
...but it's just really
badly sprained.

01:15:21.791 --> 01:15:24.749
Jesus. Oh, God.

01:15:24.951 --> 01:15:25.940
Bastard.

01:15:26.151 --> 01:15:29.223
- Did they tell you they caught him?
- Thank God.

01:15:29.431 --> 01:15:33.788
We nabbed somebody with the
description not far from the scene.

01:15:33.991 --> 01:15:36.869
He's denying it,
but he had her Palm Pilot.

01:15:37.271 --> 01:15:39.102
Says he found it.

01:15:39.351 --> 01:15:43.026
This is Detective Piersol.
She's been great.

01:15:43.631 --> 01:15:47.180
- There's no way to describe this.
- Of course.

01:15:47.431 --> 01:15:50.821
- The son of a bitch. Who is he?
- Jesus Rossi.

01:15:51.031 --> 01:15:54.706
- Rossi?
- Lives in Elizabeth. 28, no priors.

01:15:54.911 --> 01:15:58.142
- That's an Italian name.
- Am I missing something?

01:15:58.351 --> 01:16:02.026
The girl said he was a Puerto Rican,
that's all.

01:16:02.271 --> 01:16:06.423
- I just wanna take a shower, okay?
- We'll be done here soon.

01:16:06.951 --> 01:16:08.464
All right.

01:16:08.671 --> 01:16:09.660
Mom!

01:16:09.871 --> 01:16:13.784
- Jason.
- Jesus, Mom.

01:16:14.031 --> 01:16:17.182
What did these lousy fuckers do?

01:16:17.391 --> 01:16:18.790
I'll be all right.

01:16:18.991 --> 01:16:21.221
I'm gonna kill these fuckers.

01:16:21.711 --> 01:16:23.030
- Jason.
- Fuck it, Dad!

01:16:23.231 --> 01:16:26.780
You know the world is a sewer!
Nothing but a sewer!

01:16:26.991 --> 01:16:30.586
It's animals out there running wild!
They're winning!

01:16:30.791 --> 01:16:34.067
The police caught the man that did it.

01:16:34.271 --> 01:16:37.308
I want five minutes with that asshole!

01:16:37.511 --> 01:16:39.467
She doesn't need to hear it.

01:16:39.671 --> 01:16:44.062
Why don't you go outside and
settle down? I'll be right out.

01:16:50.031 --> 01:16:53.421
- Hello?
- May I speak to Anthony Soprano?

01:16:53.671 --> 01:16:56.469
He's not available now.
Who's calling?

01:16:56.671 --> 01:17:01.825
This is Jennifer Melfi.
Is this Mrs. Soprano?

01:17:02.471 --> 01:17:04.302
Yes, it is. How are you?

01:17:04.511 --> 01:17:07.947
That's why I'm calling,
to cancel his appointment.

01:17:08.151 --> 01:17:10.824
He'll be disappointed.
Nothing serious.

01:17:11.831 --> 01:17:13.901
A car accident, but I'm fine.

01:17:14.111 --> 01:17:18.184
I hope they had insurance.
You weren't hurt, I hope?

01:17:18.391 --> 01:17:23.465
My knee got the worst of it. But I'll
be up and about in a couple of days.

01:17:23.671 --> 01:17:26.265
I'll tell him.
You stay off of it.

01:17:26.471 --> 01:17:27.699
Who ate the cake?

01:17:27.911 --> 01:17:29.629
Thank you, I will.

01:17:29.831 --> 01:17:33.380
Thank you for giving him the message.

01:17:34.431 --> 01:17:36.706
That's gotta be some marriage.

01:17:36.951 --> 01:17:39.749
Hello, Kate? This is Jennifer Melfi.

01:17:39.951 --> 01:17:44.502
I know the phone upsets you,
but I need to cancel our appointment.

01:17:46.431 --> 01:17:50.390
- Tell him what?
- That was your therapist.

01:17:50.631 --> 01:17:54.943
Why don't you just announce
it on WFAN? Go find some dust!

01:17:55.951 --> 01:17:59.023
She was in a car accident.
She has to cancel.

01:17:59.471 --> 01:18:03.350
- She all right?
- She was okay. She hurt her knee.

01:18:03.551 --> 01:18:07.624
Her knee? Really? What happened?

01:18:07.831 --> 01:18:10.584
I don't know. She didn't say.

01:18:12.511 --> 01:18:17.460
I hope she don't need stitches.
Stitches on the knee never heal right.

01:18:17.671 --> 01:18:19.468
Can leave a very bad scar.

01:18:22.351 --> 01:18:24.819
Any knee injury can be very serious.

01:18:25.071 --> 01:18:28.780
You can get arthritis for
the rest of your life.

01:18:29.191 --> 01:18:31.751
- Ask Joe Namath.
- No, thanks.

01:18:36.191 --> 01:18:39.786
Listen, last time...

01:18:39.991 --> 01:18:44.826
...she mentioned that maybe
you would come into my therapy.

01:18:45.991 --> 01:18:51.190
Give your perspective on
the panic attacks and kind of...

01:18:51.391 --> 01:18:54.986
...our home life. Whatever.

01:18:57.351 --> 01:18:58.784
Sure.

01:19:00.391 --> 01:19:02.780
But not now. She's sick.

01:19:10.071 --> 01:19:14.622
- They call yet?
- No, not yet.

01:19:14.831 --> 01:19:17.664
I thought they'd call by now.

01:19:17.871 --> 01:19:22.387
They said they'd call when
they want us to come down.

01:19:22.631 --> 01:19:27.785
Look, I'm gonna call them.
Where's that detective's card?

01:19:28.031 --> 01:19:31.501
They said they'd call.
I don't want to bother them.

01:19:31.711 --> 01:19:36.785
I'm not gonna let you just wait here.
I'm gonna call them.

01:19:39.511 --> 01:19:41.820
Hello. Hi, Detective Piersol?

01:19:42.071 --> 01:19:46.189
I'm on hold.

01:19:48.791 --> 01:19:53.182
She is? Then maybe you can help me.
This is Dr. La Penna.

01:19:53.391 --> 01:19:55.780
I'm calling for Jennifer Melfi.

01:19:55.991 --> 01:19:59.381
The rape. Right, Detective Piersol
was gonna call...

01:19:59.631 --> 01:20:02.782
...when you were ready
for us to come down.

01:20:03.031 --> 01:20:05.591
What? Why not?

01:20:05.791 --> 01:20:07.190
What's going on?

01:20:07.391 --> 01:20:10.667
- Why? That's ridiculous.
- What happened?

01:20:10.871 --> 01:20:13.066
It isn't Piersol.
She's moved.

01:20:13.271 --> 01:20:14.909
She never said anything.

01:20:15.151 --> 01:20:18.109
You just let him go?
Are you fucking crazy?

01:20:18.351 --> 01:20:21.661
Yes, I do need to use
this kind of language!

01:20:21.911 --> 01:20:24.630
- I don't care if you're sorry.
- Richard.

01:20:24.871 --> 01:20:26.384
Fine, you do that.

01:20:26.591 --> 01:20:31.790
You haven't heard the end of this.
I'm contacting my attorney. Asshole!

01:20:32.551 --> 01:20:35.019
- What?
- Chain of custody was mishandled...

01:20:35.231 --> 01:20:38.906
...so they let him go.
- They let him go?

01:20:39.111 --> 01:20:42.421
Somebody misplaced
the evidence kit or something...

01:20:42.631 --> 01:20:45.429
I don't know what they did,
those idiots!

01:20:45.631 --> 01:20:49.146
Is he just out until the trial?
I can identify him.

01:20:49.351 --> 01:20:53.583
It's a legal thing. I think they
just have to let him skip.

01:20:54.831 --> 01:20:57.789
That's impossible. You misunderstood.

01:20:58.031 --> 01:20:59.908
Give me the phone.

01:21:00.111 --> 01:21:04.343
- I told you what he told me.
- Before or after you cursed at him?

01:21:04.551 --> 01:21:09.750
Give me the phone. I'll call them.
All right. I'll call.

01:21:16.071 --> 01:21:19.666
Detective Lindheim, please.
Yes, I'll hold.

01:21:19.911 --> 01:21:22.584
Now it's not even the same cop.

01:21:24.671 --> 01:21:29.426
Hello. Dick La Penna again. I want to
apologize for losing my temper.

01:21:29.671 --> 01:21:32.504
Could I please have the phone?

01:21:32.711 --> 01:21:35.179
Just a second.

01:21:40.391 --> 01:21:44.179
Hello? I'm sorry, I don't
understand what's going on.

01:21:44.431 --> 01:21:48.788
I don't know what you people did,
but I can identify him.

01:21:54.391 --> 01:21:58.987
I don't know what to say. I'm stunned.

01:22:04.271 --> 01:22:08.628
They had to let him go...

01:22:08.871 --> 01:22:12.580
...because they fouled up
the chain of custody.

01:22:12.831 --> 01:22:14.787
What am I gonna do?

01:22:14.991 --> 01:22:18.301
You're gonna have someone
escort you to your car.

01:22:18.511 --> 01:22:23.221
- What's that supposed to mean?
- That's what the counselor told me.

01:22:23.431 --> 01:22:26.503
Deserted garages are
where attacks happen.

01:22:26.751 --> 01:22:31.108
You think this is my fault.
Do you blame me for what happened?

01:22:31.591 --> 01:22:34.788
I told you to call security
when it's late.

01:22:34.991 --> 01:22:37.141
It wasn't late.

01:22:37.471 --> 01:22:40.747
- This isn't any good.
- Let me tell you something.

01:22:40.951 --> 01:22:43.749
If I hadn't have been on the
phone with you...

01:22:43.951 --> 01:22:47.705
...maybe I would've seen
that guy in the stairwell.

01:22:47.951 --> 01:22:51.261
- What?
- You and your hard-on about my patient!

01:22:52.351 --> 01:22:53.670
So it's my fault?

01:22:53.871 --> 01:22:56.829
You should've seen your face...

01:22:57.031 --> 01:23:02.230
...when you heard that that shitbag
that raped me had an Italian name.

01:23:02.871 --> 01:23:06.625
You're the one who told
them he was Puerto Rican.

01:23:06.831 --> 01:23:08.981
What difference does it make?

01:23:09.191 --> 01:23:11.500
Are you so ashamed
of your background...

01:23:11.751 --> 01:23:16.381
...that any misdeed by an Italian
somehow damages your self-esteem?

01:23:16.831 --> 01:23:18.469
This is so misdirected.

01:23:18.671 --> 01:23:22.505
The whole fucking world's
about your self-esteem.

01:23:22.711 --> 01:23:24.861
Or maybe you don't have enough.

01:23:25.351 --> 01:23:26.989
Jennifer, come on.

01:23:27.231 --> 01:23:29.426
Fuck you, Richard.

01:23:29.671 --> 01:23:31.104
Jen!

01:23:41.351 --> 01:23:43.660
How's Ralphie? With you over him?

01:23:43.871 --> 01:23:45.065
He busts balls.

01:23:45.271 --> 01:23:49.662
He played like it was his idea
for me to be Aprile crew captain.

01:23:49.871 --> 01:23:52.988
What is he gonna do?
Tony cut off his cazzi.

01:23:53.191 --> 01:23:57.070
Very prudently. Not that you
ain't gonna hear more later.

01:23:57.271 --> 01:24:00.786
Most of the conversation
was about Johnny moving.

01:24:00.991 --> 01:24:03.585
Ginny told Gabriella
she needs a big house.

01:24:03.791 --> 01:24:07.625
Ginny Sacrimoni?
What she needs is her own zip code.

01:24:07.831 --> 01:24:11.983
Jersey's a small state.
She moves in, she could tip it over.

01:24:12.191 --> 01:24:13.988
I like something to grab onto.

01:24:14.191 --> 01:24:17.422
You grab onto her,
your hands will disappear.

01:24:17.631 --> 01:24:21.829
- She's so fat, her blood is RagÃº.
- When she goes camping...

01:24:22.071 --> 01:24:23.629
...bears hide their food.

01:24:23.831 --> 01:24:27.221
When Ginny hauls ass,
she's gotta make two trips.

01:24:27.431 --> 01:24:31.140
Two guys could fuck her at
the same time and never meet.

01:24:31.351 --> 01:24:33.182
Johnny!

01:24:34.031 --> 01:24:36.420
- Fuck who?
- What?

01:24:36.631 --> 01:24:38.064
What's so funny?

01:24:38.271 --> 01:24:41.069
Nothing. We're just talking
about a girl.

01:24:41.271 --> 01:24:43.990
Is that all you do,
is talk about cooze?

01:24:44.231 --> 01:24:48.304
When we're not planting potatoes.
Welcome. You wanna drink?

01:24:48.511 --> 01:24:51.787
I mean it.
You don't keep up with events?

01:24:51.991 --> 01:24:53.982
- What?
- It's all over 1010 WINS.

01:24:54.231 --> 01:24:58.190
It's right there in front of you.
Turn it up.

01:24:58.391 --> 01:25:03.101
After years of planning and delays,
there's good news for Newark.

01:25:03.311 --> 01:25:07.543
Coming from the Passaic River where
Assemblyman Ronald Zellman...

01:25:07.751 --> 01:25:12.222
...held a press conference to
announce the release of $ 25 million...

01:25:12.471 --> 01:25:14.587
...in state and federal funds.

01:25:14.791 --> 01:25:16.941
25 million.

01:25:17.391 --> 01:25:22.419
The time has come to return Newark
and its waterfront to its past glory.

01:25:23.151 --> 01:25:27.269
By the year 2003, this long-neglected
stretch of riverfront...

01:25:27.471 --> 01:25:31.828
...will be alive with condominiums,
film studios and public parks.

01:25:32.071 --> 01:25:34.710
A self-perpetuating revenue base.

01:25:34.951 --> 01:25:38.990
The $ 100 million Newark Museum
of Science and Trucking...

01:25:39.191 --> 01:25:44.390
...will serve to make this the
attraction of the area and beyond.

01:25:44.951 --> 01:25:49.103
This fucking busted valise,
he's worth every cent of his cut.

01:25:49.311 --> 01:25:52.189
Fucking dry wall contracts alone.

01:25:52.431 --> 01:25:54.308
- Thank you very much.

01:26:03.951 --> 01:26:06.385
Jen, can I come in?

01:26:12.271 --> 01:26:14.580
I'm sorry.

01:26:17.151 --> 01:26:19.984
I'm just so frustrated.

01:26:20.751 --> 01:26:21.820
We both are.

01:26:22.031 --> 01:26:26.468
I just want to go find that bastard
and kill him with my hands.

01:26:26.671 --> 01:26:31.870
And I could and I would. But I can't.

01:26:32.271 --> 01:26:35.388
They'd put me in jail,
that's how things are.

01:26:35.871 --> 01:26:37.987
I know.

01:26:44.391 --> 01:26:48.304
- You said Satriale's at 1.
- So now you know how it feels.

01:26:48.551 --> 01:26:53.750
I know why I'm here and I apologize.
I won't let it happen again.

01:26:54.711 --> 01:26:56.383
Let's go.

01:27:03.311 --> 01:27:05.950
I asked you to
watch out for Jackie, Jr.

01:27:06.191 --> 01:27:09.422
I said, "Don't let the kid
get involved in this."

01:27:09.631 --> 01:27:12.941
I hear about a joint,
and Jackie's a part of it.

01:27:13.151 --> 01:27:18.350
He only drove. I said I was sorry.
Let me tell you, he was an asset.

01:27:18.711 --> 01:27:22.943
He pissed on the car seats,
but he handled himself very good.

01:27:23.151 --> 01:27:25.665
You listening?
Leave him out of it.

01:27:26.511 --> 01:27:29.821
He begged me for a taste.
He's the heir apparent.

01:27:30.031 --> 01:27:34.024
I don 't want him mixed up in this.
I promised his old man.

01:27:34.231 --> 01:27:37.746
- But it's all right for me?
- I didn't say that.

01:27:37.951 --> 01:27:43.025
What did you say? The life's good
for me, but not for Lord Fuckpants?

01:27:43.231 --> 01:27:48.385
Look, he's not suited to it.
He's not like you. Like us.

01:27:48.591 --> 01:27:52.379
Kids today, they're bored,
they're spoiled.

01:27:54.591 --> 01:27:59.301
- I promised his old man.
- What? You promised him what?

01:27:59.551 --> 01:28:01.781
I don't know.

01:28:02.191 --> 01:28:04.751
I was his best friend.

01:28:05.671 --> 01:28:08.390
Don't bust my balls.

01:28:08.591 --> 01:28:11.583
I gotta go make a stop in Nutley.

01:28:12.631 --> 01:28:14.587
Come here.

01:28:19.991 --> 01:28:21.822
I love you.

01:28:22.071 --> 01:28:24.380
You're a good boy.

01:28:33.471 --> 01:28:36.622
Lord Fuckpants? Whose moniker is that?

01:28:36.871 --> 01:28:38.987
I'm not sure it is a moniker.

01:29:13.471 --> 01:29:16.110
Hi. Come on in.

01:29:16.991 --> 01:29:22.190
Jesus. What's the other guy look like?

01:29:33.071 --> 01:29:36.381
That must have been some accident.
What happened?

01:29:36.591 --> 01:29:40.220
Someone ran a stop sign on
Eisenhower Parkway.

01:29:40.791 --> 01:29:44.625
- It was one of those things.
- I know a woman with one leg.

01:29:44.991 --> 01:29:46.982
Terrible thing.

01:29:47.511 --> 01:29:52.710
Last time we met we talked about
getting you into behavioral therapy.

01:29:53.071 --> 01:29:57.383
I brought a couple of things
for you to look at.

01:29:59.031 --> 01:30:03.741
"Feel the Fear and Do It Anyway."
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

01:30:06.591 --> 01:30:10.584
The title leaves something
to be desired.

01:30:13.671 --> 01:30:16.026
It's okay, it's just your...

01:30:16.271 --> 01:30:20.389
It's okay. I'm sorry. Sorry.

01:30:21.151 --> 01:30:22.379
You want me to...?

01:30:22.591 --> 01:30:26.869
- It startled me, that's all.
- Maybe you came back too soon.

01:30:27.071 --> 01:30:30.984
- It's better for me to be busy.
- Right.

01:30:36.871 --> 01:30:40.784
I'm okay. Really.

01:30:41.271 --> 01:30:44.388
And I appreciate your concern.

01:30:50.911 --> 01:30:53.425
That's what's wrong with the world.

01:30:53.671 --> 01:30:56.504
A person is minding
their own business...

01:30:56.751 --> 01:31:00.983
...and some fucking asshole comes out
and smashes into them.

01:31:03.711 --> 01:31:07.420
- You can't control everything.
- You can get pissed off.

01:31:07.671 --> 01:31:10.390
And then what? Lose control?

01:31:10.591 --> 01:31:13.389
You direct your
anger where it belongs.

01:31:13.591 --> 01:31:15.229
You have panic attacks.

01:31:15.431 --> 01:31:20.630
Panic occurs when feelings of anger,
revenge, whatever, overwhelm you.

01:31:21.231 --> 01:31:24.029
That's where behavioral therapy
comes in.

01:31:24.271 --> 01:31:28.787
It can teach you to control
those triggers.

01:31:30.551 --> 01:31:33.429
How do you get people
to do what you want?

01:31:33.871 --> 01:31:37.705
You tell your mother it's
hers anytime she wants it.

01:31:37.911 --> 01:31:41.699
- How was your cousin's shower?
- It sounded like screaming.

01:31:41.911 --> 01:31:45.620
I wondered whose Z24 was in
the driveway. You get a car?

01:31:45.831 --> 01:31:47.389
Yeah.

01:31:48.151 --> 01:31:51.621
Where did I put the sleeves
to that samovar?

01:31:52.791 --> 01:31:56.420
- You want anything? A Coke?
- No, I'm set, Ton.

01:31:56.671 --> 01:31:59.424
I heard Ralph Cifaretto
got passed over.

01:31:59.671 --> 01:32:01.343
You heard about what? Who?

01:32:01.551 --> 01:32:04.065
I'm saying that was probably smart.

01:32:04.311 --> 01:32:08.270
- He's kind of a cool guy...
- That's none of your concern.

01:32:08.511 --> 01:32:11.901
You were going to college.
I hear shit from Chris?

01:32:12.111 --> 01:32:16.229
- You didn't talk to Chris. Shit.
- That's right.

01:32:16.631 --> 01:32:18.542
I promised your dad.

01:32:18.751 --> 01:32:22.061
Don't make this hard.
I got a son to bust my balls.

01:32:22.311 --> 01:32:24.620
I'm home!

01:32:25.311 --> 01:32:27.029
Ma?

01:32:27.831 --> 01:32:30.425
Hey, Jackie. What are you doing here?

01:32:30.631 --> 01:32:32.622
I'm waiting for you.

01:32:35.351 --> 01:32:36.420
What? No hello?

01:32:36.631 --> 01:32:39.429
I need $200 to put in
my student account.

01:32:39.631 --> 01:32:41.701
We haven't talked for weeks.

01:32:41.911 --> 01:32:45.381
I look forward to total
independence, believe me.

01:32:45.591 --> 01:32:49.106
African-Americans go to Columbia.
Some are my friends.

01:32:49.311 --> 01:32:53.782
My ass. On my couch, watching TV
with his shoes off with you?

01:32:53.991 --> 01:32:56.664
Meadow, when did you get here?

01:33:03.831 --> 01:33:05.787
See you. Say hi to your mom.

01:33:05.991 --> 01:33:08.824
Come into the city, we'll do sushi.

01:33:09.071 --> 01:33:11.221
I won't say anything.

01:33:11.431 --> 01:33:14.423
You just remember
what we talked about.

01:33:18.631 --> 01:33:23.147
I'll have a chicken avocado wrap,
no dressing. And a Coke.

01:33:23.391 --> 01:33:27.623
One number three,
dressing on the side.

01:33:28.071 --> 01:33:29.629
Thanks.

01:34:31.791 --> 01:34:33.622
Excuse me. Wait a minute.

01:34:33.831 --> 01:34:36.584
Let go of me! Let the fuck go of me!

01:34:36.791 --> 01:34:40.704
- We don't wanna continue. Give us leg.
- What leg?

01:34:40.911 --> 01:34:44.506
Don't do this to me.
Don't push me to edge. Repent!

01:34:44.711 --> 01:34:47.908
Motherfucker, do you know
who my brother is?

01:34:48.111 --> 01:34:50.500
- Mother, what did you say?
- Mother...

01:34:55.631 --> 01:35:00.830
Those records were all I had of my
mother. What could they mean to her?

01:35:02.231 --> 01:35:06.668
- Are you people really so callous...?
- Fuck you. You are callous.

01:36:29.791 --> 01:36:32.351
Oh, my God! Help me, please!

01:36:51.791 --> 01:36:54.703
I felt such a sense of relief.

01:36:54.951 --> 01:36:57.624
I felt safe for the first time.

01:36:57.831 --> 01:36:59.628
Empowered.

01:37:01.431 --> 01:37:03.069
The vending machine?

01:37:03.311 --> 01:37:06.542
My guilt for putting myself
in harm's way.

01:37:06.791 --> 01:37:09.942
I read about that too,
that honeymooner...

01:37:10.191 --> 01:37:14.548
...who rocked a vending machine
and it fell on him and killed him.

01:37:15.511 --> 01:37:19.470
The dog though, I don't know.

01:37:19.711 --> 01:37:24.910
The forbidden part of your psyche,
murderous rage.

01:37:25.311 --> 01:37:28.701
Yeah, but at first I thought
he was after me.

01:37:29.111 --> 01:37:31.944
The door said, "Danger."

01:37:32.151 --> 01:37:37.350
Actually, no, it said, "High Voltage.
Call NJGE Before Digging."

01:37:38.231 --> 01:37:40.426
"Jersey Gas and Electric."

01:37:40.671 --> 01:37:45.222
- Was Richard anywhere in all this?
- No.

01:37:45.991 --> 01:37:48.346
Oh, my God. The dog.

01:37:48.591 --> 01:37:50.741
- What?
- A rottweiler, Elliot.

01:37:50.951 --> 01:37:53.624
Big head. Massive shoulders.

01:37:53.871 --> 01:37:58.581
Descendent of the dog used by
the Roman armies to guard their camps.

01:37:58.791 --> 01:38:00.668
- I didn't know that.
- Digging?

01:38:00.871 --> 01:38:04.261
Who do I dig with?
And who's dangerous?

01:38:04.471 --> 01:38:09.670
Who could I sic on that son of a bitch
to tear him to shreds?

01:38:12.231 --> 01:38:14.267
Let me tell you something.

01:38:14.511 --> 01:38:19.710
No feeling has ever been so sweet
as to see that pig beg...

01:38:20.111 --> 01:38:22.261
...and plead and scream for life.

01:38:22.511 --> 01:38:27.062
Because the justice system
is fucked up, Elliot.

01:38:27.311 --> 01:38:30.860
Richard's attorney is
in this at $300 an hour.

01:38:31.111 --> 01:38:34.626
Meanwhile, that
employee of the month cocksucker...

01:38:34.831 --> 01:38:39.427
...is back on the street,
and who's gonna stop him? You?

01:38:40.511 --> 01:38:42.422
Jennifer...

01:38:44.111 --> 01:38:48.150
- Civilization...
- Don't worry.

01:38:48.391 --> 01:38:51.383
I'm not going to break
the social compact.

01:38:51.911 --> 01:38:56.462
But that's not saying there's not a
certain satisfaction in knowing...

01:38:56.671 --> 01:39:01.062
...that I could have that asshole
squashed like a bug.

01:39:01.311 --> 01:39:02.790
If I wanted.

01:39:13.591 --> 01:39:15.627
What happened?

01:39:18.031 --> 01:39:19.703
Janice?

01:39:21.711 --> 01:39:25.750
I can't drive.
And they broke three ribs.

01:39:25.951 --> 01:39:31.150
What did I tell you? I told you
not to mess with those people.

01:39:31.391 --> 01:39:34.383
I was supposed to be married
at this point.

01:39:34.591 --> 01:39:37.264
- Yeah? So?
- The man I loved died.

01:39:43.111 --> 01:39:46.820
This is all I fucking need.
Thanks, Janice.

01:39:47.751 --> 01:39:49.309
- What?
- What do you mean?

01:39:49.511 --> 01:39:51.741
They slapped my sister around.

01:39:51.951 --> 01:39:55.023
I have to get payback.
It's always something.

01:39:55.231 --> 01:39:59.019
Every time I hear your voice,
I know it's gonna cost me.

01:39:59.231 --> 01:40:03.907
Time. Money. You never do anything
to simplify my life.

01:40:04.111 --> 01:40:10.061
I stole a woman's prosthetic leg.
When did I get like this?

01:40:10.271 --> 01:40:13.866
- You really wanna know?
- When Richie died.

01:40:14.071 --> 01:40:18.428
Till that time, I was functioning
at a very high level.

01:40:20.231 --> 01:40:22.950
There's only one trajectory for me.

01:40:24.111 --> 01:40:25.624
Really?

01:40:26.431 --> 01:40:30.219
- God.
- You see what I mean?

01:40:30.431 --> 01:40:33.867
All this soul-searching,
it's always on my dime.

01:40:34.071 --> 01:40:36.824
I've hit bottom, Tony.

01:40:37.911 --> 01:40:43.110
But it's odd because
I feel born again in the Lord.

01:40:45.871 --> 01:40:49.830
And I prayed to God
and I asked him...

01:40:50.031 --> 01:40:54.821
...to forgive Svetlana
for what she's done.

01:40:55.831 --> 01:41:00.700
We've been here before. With Vishnu
and Richard-fucking-Alpert...

01:41:00.911 --> 01:41:04.665
...and the Coyote Spirit.
You know what it always spells?

01:41:04.911 --> 01:41:09.541
Trouble for the rest of us.
So put your fucking clothes on.

01:41:09.791 --> 01:41:12.942
Seriously. I gotta get out of here.

01:41:13.191 --> 01:41:18.390
I give myself up utterly
and totally to God.

01:41:19.231 --> 01:41:21.620
If this is the bottom.

01:41:21.831 --> 01:41:23.059
If not...

01:41:24.071 --> 01:41:25.220
You can go now.

01:41:25.431 --> 01:41:28.662
Billing needs to see you.
Follow the blue line.

01:41:40.231 --> 01:41:42.222
Carmela.

01:41:43.311 --> 01:41:46.030
- Gorgeous as ever.
- My God, this house.

01:41:46.271 --> 01:41:47.386
You got one.

01:41:50.671 --> 01:41:54.903
Move to Jersey, but maybe take
a little bit of a halfway step?

01:41:55.111 --> 01:41:57.625
Fucking wife of mine.

01:42:03.751 --> 01:42:05.070
Gentlemen.

01:42:05.311 --> 01:42:09.862
"What we do in life
echoes in eternity."

01:42:10.071 --> 01:42:12.187
He's obsessed with Gladiator.

01:42:12.391 --> 01:42:17.067
Come on, it's a great fucking film.
"Strength and honor."

01:42:17.311 --> 01:42:21.270
Scotch and soda. Long as you're
on the way to the bar.

01:42:21.511 --> 01:42:22.864
Ball breaker.

01:42:23.111 --> 01:42:24.942
J & B, right, Ton?

01:42:25.191 --> 01:42:28.228
T, what do you think
a place like this...

01:42:28.431 --> 01:42:31.104
...set John back?
- Who gives a shit?

01:42:31.311 --> 01:42:33.984
Landscape alone's gotta be
100, 150 G's.

01:42:34.191 --> 01:42:37.820
- To keep up this lawn...
- Property taxes. Gotta pay those.

01:42:38.031 --> 01:42:39.020
Taxes.

01:42:39.231 --> 01:42:42.143
Use the money to
fix air traffic control?

01:42:42.391 --> 01:42:44.188
We should fight terrorism.

01:42:44.391 --> 01:42:48.020
How about that stampede in
Zimbabwe? Soccer game.

01:42:48.231 --> 01:42:51.826
No assigned seating. Always a problem.

01:43:07.711 --> 01:43:11.021
You're not using the cane anymore.

01:43:17.271 --> 01:43:22.220
Been making my list.

01:43:23.111 --> 01:43:28.026
Even bought a little notebook.

01:43:28.671 --> 01:43:31.231
Good. That's good.

01:43:32.551 --> 01:43:37.579
I've been thinking about your behavior
therapy idea. You got a point.

01:43:38.031 --> 01:43:42.741
I could use some help with a few
things. If they can help me there...

01:43:42.951 --> 01:43:44.543
...I should go there.

01:43:44.751 --> 01:43:45.740
No.

01:43:46.191 --> 01:43:50.070
You sure about that?
Because the last couple of times...

01:43:50.311 --> 01:43:54.827
...I've been getting the feeling
that you're giving me the boot.

01:44:04.991 --> 01:44:06.822
What's the matter?

01:44:07.031 --> 01:44:09.226
Hey, come on.

01:44:09.431 --> 01:44:11.422
What did I do?

01:44:11.631 --> 01:44:13.826
Come on, huh?

01:44:16.551 --> 01:44:18.428
Come on.

01:44:20.231 --> 01:44:24.144
Now, what did I do? What's the matter?

01:44:24.391 --> 01:44:26.461
Tell me. What's the matter?

01:44:26.711 --> 01:44:28.349
Go sit over there.

01:44:28.591 --> 01:44:31.105
We'll do this.

01:44:31.311 --> 01:44:32.824
Go.

01:44:34.711 --> 01:44:38.420
It's just my knee.

01:44:49.431 --> 01:44:51.820
It's okay. Go on.

01:44:54.711 --> 01:44:56.224
What?

01:44:57.231 --> 01:45:00.223
I mean, you wanna say something?

01:45:07.071 --> 01:45:08.220
No.

01:46:42.031 --> 01:46:43.020
