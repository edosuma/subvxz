01:21.160 --> 01:24.260
Congratulations, Learner.
You cracked your first case.

01:25.190 --> 01:28.160
Thank you, Lieutenant Hickey.
Learned a lot from you, sir.

01:29.470 --> 01:32.030
You knew. Didn't you?

01:41.040 --> 01:42.680
If I was in Mike's shoes,

01:44.010 --> 01:46.080
I might have done
the same thing he did.

01:47.550 --> 01:48.820
And slept well.

01:49.720 --> 01:53.760
These guys put their lives
on the line every single day
hunting down assholes.

01:54.490 --> 01:55.920
We sleep good at night,

01:55.990 --> 01:57.790
because these guys deal
with the ugly shit,

01:57.860 --> 01:59.330
so we don't have to.

01:59.400 --> 02:02.230
That's why the rules matter.
I'm after the truth.

02:02.300 --> 02:05.100
The truth is that
sometimes the department
doesn't protect your family

02:05.170 --> 02:08.240
after you spent your whole life
protecting everybody else's.

02:15.040 --> 02:16.810
<i>Cops.</i>

02:16.880 --> 02:18.850
<i>Most of them are good people.</i>

02:18.910 --> 02:20.380
<i>Good men and women.</i>

02:20.450 --> 02:22.920
<i>But when a police officer</i>
<i>comes from war,</i>

02:22.990 --> 02:25.020
<i>they're a different</i>
<i>kind of cop.</i>

02:26.890 --> 02:28.660
<i>Their life, their job...</i>

02:29.790 --> 02:31.690
<i>They'll never be</i>
<i>the same again.</i>

02:35.800 --> 02:38.000
<i>Doing what's gotta be done</i>
<i>takes on a different meaning,</i>

02:38.070 --> 02:40.670
<i>and another type of war starts.</i>

02:53.720 --> 02:54.880
Where are you hit?

02:54.950 --> 02:56.450
How are we gonna
get out of here?

02:57.920 --> 02:59.490
A helicopter.
What do you think?

03:03.330 --> 03:05.660
<i>After a few years</i>
<i>of active duty,</i>

03:05.730 --> 03:08.100
<i>Thornton and Moran joined</i>
<i>the New York City</i>
<i>Police Department</i>

03:08.160 --> 03:12.130
<i>as undercover narcotics cops</i>
<i>during the crack epidemic</i>
<i>of the nineties.</i>

03:12.200 --> 03:16.140
<i>They went from eating sand</i>
<i>to pounding the pavement</i>
<i>under yours truly.</i>

03:16.210 --> 03:18.410
<i>They can be a real pain</i>
<i>in the ass sometimes.</i>

03:18.470 --> 03:21.810
<i>But wherever they went,</i>
<i>you always knew</i>
<i>they'd be in it together.</i>

03:21.880 --> 03:24.680
<i>Only death was gonna</i>
<i>separate those two.</i>

03:44.330 --> 03:47.240
Hey, <i>hermano,relax.</i>
We're just having some fun.

03:47.940 --> 03:50.440
You don't get high
on your own supply, <i>cabr√≥n.</i>

03:50.510 --> 03:52.840
Hey, hey. Let's go.

04:21.740 --> 04:23.110
Hey, yo, I-- I seen it.

04:23.710 --> 04:26.770
They're all in there
waving it around, shit-bragging.

04:27.440 --> 04:31.110
There's a lot of motherfuckers
up in and out of there
all high and shit.

04:32.480 --> 04:33.650
What's he wearing?

04:33.720 --> 04:34.920
What's up with his girl?

04:35.450 --> 04:37.390
I-- I don't know, man.
You-- I don't know.

04:37.450 --> 04:39.460
It's gray, black,
some-- some shit.

04:39.520 --> 04:41.590
I don't know, man. I didn't--
I didn't catch that.

04:41.660 --> 04:43.760
<i>Gracias.You stay low.</i>

04:44.430 --> 04:45.630
Yeah. All right.

04:52.930 --> 04:54.770
Our guy's there.
He got a buddy in there.

04:55.440 --> 04:56.640
You ready?

04:56.710 --> 04:58.610
Another day, another door.

05:19.190 --> 05:21.560
Entry to the leader.
CI states two suspects present.

05:21.630 --> 05:23.030
Possession of gun.

05:23.100 --> 05:24.430
Rock and roll, boss.

05:25.400 --> 05:27.300
Unit, stand by
for the green.

05:31.810 --> 05:33.410
Hey, yo, <i>Papi.You good?</i>

05:33.480 --> 05:35.980
- Yeah, I'm good. You the same?
- Yeah? Yeah.

05:36.050 --> 05:38.050
- Mm-hmm.
- Anyone holding?

05:39.450 --> 05:40.480
What you want?

05:42.320 --> 05:44.120
I want you to kiss that
motherfucking concrete.

05:44.190 --> 05:47.220
Yeah, nigga. Yeah,
drop that shit, huh.

05:47.290 --> 05:49.630
Don't fuck around.
Yeah, spread that shit.

05:50.230 --> 05:51.690
- What you got on you,
motherfucker?
- Ain't got shit.

05:51.760 --> 05:54.660
Don't lie, nigga.
What the fuck you got? Hmm?

05:54.730 --> 05:56.030
Told you I ain't
got shit, man.

05:56.100 --> 05:58.430
What the fuck is this? Okay.

05:58.500 --> 06:00.270
Okay. Lie now.

06:00.340 --> 06:02.470
Put your hands behind your back.
Don't fucking move.

06:05.570 --> 06:07.540
Got your ass now.

06:07.610 --> 06:08.880
Front secure.

06:08.940 --> 06:11.380
Okay, unit. You got the green.

06:33.670 --> 06:35.700
Police! Raise your hands!
Raise your hands!

06:35.770 --> 06:38.740
Get down! Get down
on your back! Everybody down!

06:45.550 --> 06:46.580
Okay, okay!

06:47.550 --> 06:49.080
Who are these fucking--

06:49.150 --> 06:51.390
Shut your fucking mouth!
Get the fuck out!

06:59.400 --> 07:01.530
Where are you going
so fast, <i>flaco?</i>

07:01.960 --> 07:03.200
Fucking!

07:04.800 --> 07:06.030
Shut your mouth!

07:06.100 --> 07:08.600
Shut your fucking
goddamn mouth!

07:10.610 --> 07:12.880
- What's her story?
- She's bragging about
her boyfriend

07:12.940 --> 07:14.680
- fucking killing a cop.
- Tom, Tom.

07:14.740 --> 07:16.680
It's not worth it.
He's a cop killer.
We need the case.

07:16.750 --> 07:18.180
Jimmy O?

07:18.250 --> 07:19.650
<i>What's been going</i>
<i>on with your guy?</i>

07:21.080 --> 07:24.490
He's got a car-alarm
remote. No keys.

07:24.550 --> 07:25.750
Wanna give it a whirl?

07:25.820 --> 07:27.260
Sure. Stand by.

07:34.800 --> 07:36.530
One of our cops is dead.

07:37.200 --> 07:39.600
Benito, you're looking at life
for killing a cop,

07:41.040 --> 07:43.070
and that is a long-ass
stretch of 22.

07:43.140 --> 07:44.910
But I didn't kill no cop.

07:44.970 --> 07:47.980
Hey, I believe you,
but you was there.

07:49.880 --> 07:51.810
So you're swinging
with your boy,

07:51.880 --> 07:53.580
unless you own this.

07:54.150 --> 07:56.950
You make yourself look good
by saying,

07:57.020 --> 07:59.520
"Yes, I am a drug dealer."

07:59.590 --> 08:01.590
You know?
"But I don't kill cops."

08:02.720 --> 08:04.990
And then you tell us
what Renaldo did,

08:05.060 --> 08:07.160
and you got another big problem.

08:07.230 --> 08:10.070
We found a ton of shit
in your crib,

08:10.970 --> 08:12.200
so we need your connect.

08:12.700 --> 08:15.300
I don't wanna sell drugs.
I've got a kid.

08:15.370 --> 08:17.640
I need to feed my family.
There's things I gotta do, man.

08:17.710 --> 08:19.510
Hey, man, I'm listening.

08:19.580 --> 08:21.010
I'm not judging you.

08:21.080 --> 08:23.510
We all do what we gotta do
for our family,

08:23.580 --> 08:26.720
even if that means that
doing what's right by them

08:26.780 --> 08:28.280
ain't exactly right.

08:30.450 --> 08:33.820
But you're not doing them
any good if you go away, right?

08:34.490 --> 08:37.460
So, give me the cop killer
and your connect,

08:37.530 --> 08:39.700
and I will make this
right with the DA.

08:41.200 --> 08:42.760
When I say
I'm gonna do something,

08:42.830 --> 08:44.430
I see it through to the end.

08:47.640 --> 08:48.670
Chayo.

08:55.640 --> 08:56.780
Good fucking job.

08:57.650 --> 08:58.650
Hey.

09:00.380 --> 09:03.420
Write down what Chayo
did to that cop.

09:03.490 --> 09:06.320
Do you want, uh,
soda or something?

09:09.990 --> 09:11.160
Yo.

09:13.830 --> 09:15.130
What's up?

09:16.870 --> 09:18.470
You were looking
to hook me up,

09:19.200 --> 09:20.540
even though I did wrong?

09:22.500 --> 09:24.670
There's all kinds of rights
and wrongs in this world.

09:24.740 --> 09:28.740
You know, sometimes
you gotta do a smaller wrong
for a bigger right.

09:29.680 --> 09:32.210
You got a dead cop's gun,
your teeth in his nightstick,

09:32.280 --> 09:33.480
and you don't wanna
say anything.

09:33.550 --> 09:36.490
What am I gonna say?
I did it?

09:36.550 --> 09:38.190
Benito's gonna say you did.

09:38.250 --> 09:40.860
Okay. So? Whatever.

09:41.620 --> 09:44.590
Or maybe there's something else
you wanna share.

09:46.500 --> 09:50.570
It's okay. Go to court.
Take my chance.

09:55.640 --> 09:58.240
Your girlfriend said
Chayo killed the cop.

09:59.110 --> 10:00.680
You're gonna die in jail.

10:02.240 --> 10:05.280
Hey, cop, we all dead, okay?

10:05.350 --> 10:08.950
Five, ten, maybe 50 years,

10:09.020 --> 10:11.050
but we all die sometime.

10:11.120 --> 10:12.650
Doesn't matter.

10:18.430 --> 10:20.060
You made me miss
my Yankees game.

10:20.130 --> 10:22.160
I'm here, I'm old,
and I'm pissed.

10:23.370 --> 10:25.230
I just had to listen
to the CO of Homicide

10:25.300 --> 10:27.540
cry in my ear like
some kind of jilted bitch

10:27.600 --> 10:29.770
because you didn't notify him
of the warrant.

10:30.410 --> 10:33.310
Honestly, we got a tip
from a confidential informant

10:33.380 --> 10:37.350
about a stash house,
a large quantity,
possibly some weapons,

10:37.410 --> 10:38.750
and it was moving soon.

10:38.810 --> 10:40.950
Yeah, it was just
one of those things.

10:41.020 --> 10:42.320
One of those things, smart-ass?

10:42.380 --> 10:44.050
- Yeah.
- How about one of these things?

10:44.120 --> 10:45.650
Wrongfully or failure to,

10:45.720 --> 10:47.760
because Homicide wants me
to put you on paper,

10:47.820 --> 10:51.330
and if I start any sentence
with either or both
of those things,

10:51.390 --> 10:52.830
you two won't see
another vacation day

10:52.890 --> 10:54.560
until the next good
president gets in.

10:54.630 --> 10:57.000
I checked with
the search warrant registry,

10:57.070 --> 10:59.430
but there's no sworn affidavit.

10:59.500 --> 11:02.970
So what I don't know
is if he did or didn't tell you

11:03.670 --> 11:05.610
about the shooter
before the warrant was issued.

11:05.670 --> 11:10.910
Boss, CI-4622 has
confidential informant status,

11:10.980 --> 11:12.650
which means it's not required.

11:12.710 --> 11:14.750
Yeah, and I can't talk
to your informant,

11:14.820 --> 11:16.450
so it's your word
against homicide,

11:16.520 --> 11:18.550
and personally,
I could give a rat's ass.

11:18.620 --> 11:20.460
We're trying to put
a cop killer behind bars.

11:20.520 --> 11:22.160
That's gotta be more important
than a fucking phone call.

11:22.220 --> 11:23.730
Oh, I agree.

11:23.790 --> 11:25.690
But you guys didn't know
before you entered the room

11:25.760 --> 11:27.400
that there was a couple
of cop killers
in there, did you?

11:31.330 --> 11:33.640
A last-minute tip
from a CI

11:33.700 --> 11:36.910
about a stash getting ready
to move, so we jumped.

11:37.610 --> 11:39.840
It wasn't until we found the gun
and the broken teeth

11:39.910 --> 11:41.480
that we got suspicious.

11:41.540 --> 11:43.010
There's certain protocols
that have to be followed,

11:43.080 --> 11:45.410
Detective Thornton,
you know, but, you know...

11:46.450 --> 11:49.180
- What do I know?
- Yes, sir.

11:49.250 --> 11:51.620
- I mean...
- Keep your nose clean.

11:58.290 --> 12:00.400
Dad, can I hold
your baseball mitt?

12:00.460 --> 12:03.800
Baseball players call it
a "glove," not a "mitt."

12:04.300 --> 12:05.600
The glove.

12:05.670 --> 12:07.340
I won two state
championships

12:07.400 --> 12:09.010
pitching with this old thing

12:09.070 --> 12:10.710
before I joined the Marines.

12:11.610 --> 12:13.380
- Ready to play ball?
- Yeah.

12:13.440 --> 12:14.710
All right, Mark.

12:14.780 --> 12:16.910
Let's show your old man
what you got.

12:18.880 --> 12:19.920
All right.

12:22.090 --> 12:23.320
Ready?

12:24.850 --> 12:25.920
Again.

12:26.990 --> 12:28.460
Whoo. Again.

12:31.760 --> 12:32.790
Good.

12:34.030 --> 12:35.900
Now, the fastball.

12:40.170 --> 12:41.500
What's wrong, Dad?

12:43.940 --> 12:45.840
Hey, you all right?

12:45.910 --> 12:47.380
Yeah.

12:47.440 --> 12:48.840
- You gotta go
to a doctor, baby.
- Yeah.

12:48.910 --> 12:50.950
You've had this thing
for a week.

12:52.950 --> 12:54.180
You sure you're okay?

12:54.250 --> 12:56.620
Yeah, I'm fine,
I'm fine, I'm fine.

12:56.690 --> 12:58.590
- I'm fine. Yeah.
- Yeah? Okay.

12:59.290 --> 13:00.520
All right.

13:01.120 --> 13:03.290
You ready? Take your stance.

13:04.590 --> 13:06.500
Target, not your mom.

13:10.870 --> 13:12.530
- Good boy. Again.
- There you go.

13:13.440 --> 13:14.470
And again.

13:14.940 --> 13:17.740
Dad, when can we go pitch off
a real mound?

13:19.080 --> 13:20.440
When I got time.

13:26.120 --> 13:28.680
<i>I'd fooled myself</i>
<i>into thinking</i>
<i>the doctor would tell me</i>

13:28.750 --> 13:30.290
<i>it was something else.</i>

13:31.020 --> 13:32.260
<i>The tests don't lie.</i>

13:32.920 --> 13:35.660
<i>This was the third time</i>
<i>this week I've pissed blood.</i>

13:36.490 --> 13:39.100
<i>My father died</i>
<i>of the same thing</i>
<i>about this age.</i>

13:41.560 --> 13:45.470
<i>You can't really say</i>
<i>civilian life was agreeing</i>
<i>with me in those days.</i>

13:46.740 --> 13:48.370
<i>Besides my partner,</i>

13:49.500 --> 13:52.310
<i>I had nothing but booze</i>
<i>and a stripper.</i>

13:52.370 --> 13:54.980
<i>I envied Moran and his family.</i>

13:56.850 --> 13:59.920
<i>I had no clue he was</i>
<i>in a worse place than me.</i>

14:30.550 --> 14:32.580
Hey, Ginger,
come home with me.

14:36.850 --> 14:39.020
Come home, baby.
Let's go. Come on.

14:39.090 --> 14:41.020
It's my night
with the kid, Mikey.

15:01.440 --> 15:03.780
Mike, they're gonna cut you off.

15:24.230 --> 15:25.300
Hey, buddy.

15:26.040 --> 15:29.210
Hey, Dad. Can I sleep
on the couch tonight?

15:29.270 --> 15:31.710
Are you gonna be here
in the morning when I wake up?

15:32.640 --> 15:36.010
Of course I'm gonna be here
and, yes, you can sleep
on the couch.

15:36.950 --> 15:38.310
- I love you.
- I love you too.

15:38.380 --> 15:39.650
I'm gonna go to bed.

16:51.950 --> 16:53.790
<i>You talked to your CI,</i>

16:53.860 --> 16:57.360
Se√±or, or whatever the fuck
his secret squirrel name is?

16:57.430 --> 16:59.400
He missed his meet.

16:59.460 --> 17:02.160
Since when are junkies punctual?

17:02.230 --> 17:03.200
Never.

17:03.830 --> 17:06.370
Hey, uh, is boss gonna
come up with the money

17:06.440 --> 17:07.900
if we need to make a buy?

17:08.770 --> 17:10.710
Yeah. Yeah,
just lay it out,

17:10.770 --> 17:12.410
and I'll give it to you
when you get here.

17:12.480 --> 17:14.210
I don't have that kind of cash.

17:21.950 --> 17:22.920
Here.

17:23.550 --> 17:24.520
Great.

17:25.050 --> 17:26.860
- See ya. Later.
- Later.

17:30.260 --> 17:31.390
Look who it is.

17:32.030 --> 17:34.830
Hey, hey. How's
the good life, Frankie?

17:36.000 --> 17:37.100
I'm getting by.

17:40.140 --> 17:45.010
Man, you know what,
I look forward
to the golden years, you know?

17:45.070 --> 17:50.180
When I can just sit around
drinking on my fat-ass
pension all day.

17:51.980 --> 17:55.550
Fat pension? I'm drinking
Bud Light over here.

17:59.720 --> 18:02.060
I'm feeling generous today.
Get him a shot.

18:03.290 --> 18:04.630
Thank you, Michael.

18:06.460 --> 18:07.700
What's it like?

18:09.200 --> 18:12.830
- What's what, like?
- The moon. The pension.

18:13.640 --> 18:16.210
Well, it's like shit on rye.

18:18.310 --> 18:21.640
No. Strike that. Even worse.

18:22.380 --> 18:23.980
Say it how it is.

18:24.050 --> 18:27.050
Oh, yeah, well, wait till
you're living off half a salary

18:27.120 --> 18:29.620
clipping coupons
like your grandmother.

18:29.680 --> 18:31.350
I fucking do.

18:31.420 --> 18:34.290
Only hitting the bars
that have senior discounts.

18:37.860 --> 18:39.260
Might as well be dead.

18:41.000 --> 18:44.170
But I can't, right?
Because, well, I got debt.

18:44.230 --> 18:47.770
And I got a kid,
so I gotta watch out.
I don't wanna leave it back.

18:52.870 --> 18:54.940
But some days I think, "Hey,

18:55.010 --> 18:57.980
maybe I should have been
taken out in the line of duty."

18:58.050 --> 18:59.480
Huh.

18:59.550 --> 19:00.920
Well, that's a first,

19:00.980 --> 19:02.350
a cop wanting to die
in the line of duty.

19:02.420 --> 19:04.450
It's a game-changer,
I'll tell you that much.

19:04.520 --> 19:06.860
- Keep 'em coming for this guy.
- Do you know that the city

19:06.920 --> 19:08.160
pays the widow half a mil

19:08.220 --> 19:10.130
on top of what
the pension gives?

19:10.190 --> 19:13.200
And then the union throws in
a chunk of change.

19:13.260 --> 19:16.600
And then they got that, uh,
Widows and Orphans Fund.

19:16.660 --> 19:19.900
And they got all kinds
of scholarships--
Thank you, honey.

19:19.970 --> 19:22.170
All kinds of scholarships
up the yin-yang.

19:24.610 --> 19:26.710
The bottom line that I see

19:27.310 --> 19:30.210
is that the family gets paid,
but you paid the bill.

19:31.310 --> 19:32.350
Yeah.

19:33.220 --> 19:36.920
A pension worth
a hundred percent
of your salary,

19:36.990 --> 19:42.160
400 grand in state
and federal tax benefits, right?

19:43.760 --> 19:45.360
Free life insurance.

19:46.930 --> 19:51.800
Free in-state college tuition
for my kid.

19:54.200 --> 19:56.070
Now, my boy,
he won't talk to me,

19:56.140 --> 19:58.210
but that would have been
something, right?

19:59.140 --> 20:02.410
That would have been something
for me to leave him. That's all.

20:05.280 --> 20:08.450
Yeah. I think I'm gonna go
smoke outside.

20:10.020 --> 20:11.390
Thank you, Michael.

20:23.470 --> 20:24.900
Jesus Christ.

20:27.440 --> 20:28.840
Fuck's wrong with you?

20:29.540 --> 20:30.710
Life.

20:35.380 --> 20:37.350
Se√±or.

20:37.410 --> 20:38.450
It's him?

20:39.220 --> 20:40.180
Yeah.

20:41.080 --> 20:42.280
Thank you, Soph.

22:09.000 --> 22:10.510
Ah, shit.

22:10.570 --> 22:13.980
Se√±or, how many fucking days
you been out, man?

22:15.480 --> 22:16.940
I ain't dead, man.

22:17.850 --> 22:20.050
You got my money?

22:20.120 --> 22:23.120
Yeah. We got your money.
Take it in.

22:27.490 --> 22:30.730
I ain't shit to y'all, right?
I'm just a fucking skell.

22:31.290 --> 22:34.630
Why are you saying that?
We've never treated you
like a skell.

22:34.700 --> 22:35.960
You know that. What's wrong?

22:36.030 --> 22:37.530
It's over, man.

22:38.500 --> 22:39.640
It's all over.

22:39.700 --> 22:40.970
Hey, listen.

22:41.600 --> 22:45.010
Any day you want out,
we got a bed waiting
for you in rehab.

22:45.070 --> 22:46.110
I told you that.

22:46.810 --> 22:48.980
Ah, see, I can't--
I can't never get out of this.

22:49.040 --> 22:51.580
- That's not true.
- Yeah, yeah. Yeah, it is.

22:54.050 --> 22:55.550
I got AIDS, man.

22:57.890 --> 22:59.120
Fuck, man.

23:00.620 --> 23:03.130
I ain't making it
to Christmas, kid.

23:04.830 --> 23:06.430
I got a daughter.

23:07.530 --> 23:08.600
I got a wife.

23:10.770 --> 23:14.600
I'm just glad she threw
my junky ass out before
I could infect her. You know?

23:15.400 --> 23:17.640
You know why I always
like to come here?

23:18.640 --> 23:19.910
This spot?

23:22.410 --> 23:24.380
See, back in the day,
I was, uh...

23:25.210 --> 23:26.950
I was gonna join the Navy.

23:27.680 --> 23:30.050
You know? And now, uh...

23:31.890 --> 23:33.590
I ain't got shit
to leave my family.

23:38.290 --> 23:40.760
You know, I give these
motherfuckers up...

23:42.060 --> 23:46.000
so that maybe they won't fuck up
some other kid's life
like they did mine.

23:47.370 --> 23:49.070
We've been saving this for you,

23:49.140 --> 23:51.170
just in case
you ever decide to kick it.

23:55.440 --> 23:56.510
Shit, uh...

24:01.150 --> 24:03.450
I knew you was light
when you hit me off, but, uh...

24:04.590 --> 24:06.590
just figured it went back
in your pocket.

24:08.560 --> 24:12.430
No, man, it's a savings plan
for retirement.

24:16.430 --> 24:19.170
You, uh, you still got
that address in Puerto Rico?

24:19.640 --> 24:20.640
Yeah.

24:22.810 --> 24:24.070
Send it there.

24:25.140 --> 24:26.940
My, uh...

24:27.010 --> 24:30.850
My daughter and my wife,
they're with the mom's,
you know, I...

24:31.580 --> 24:34.220
I gotta do right
by 'em, you know?

24:35.480 --> 24:36.550
Anything else?

24:37.490 --> 24:38.320
The...

24:38.950 --> 24:41.590
Don't-- don't tell 'em who--
who it's from, all right?

24:41.660 --> 24:43.430
Anything else we can do?

24:46.130 --> 24:48.060
Yeah, let me hold
your gun for a second.

24:48.130 --> 24:49.430
You don't mean that.

24:49.500 --> 24:50.600
Yeah, I do.

24:52.430 --> 24:54.870
Almost jumped in front
of a fucking train today.

24:55.540 --> 24:58.470
Right, right, right.
Look, uh...

25:00.140 --> 25:03.180
Let's meet back here,
same time tomorrow night

25:05.650 --> 25:06.680
Yeah.

25:12.050 --> 25:14.020
Fuck, man.

25:14.090 --> 25:15.620
What do you say to that, huh?

25:18.730 --> 25:20.130
Take it on the chin.

25:21.660 --> 25:23.000
That's all you can do.

25:31.640 --> 25:34.610
He's not the only one who's
not gonna make it to Christmas.

25:38.380 --> 25:39.750
I got stomach cancer.

25:40.850 --> 25:42.220
Had it for a while.

25:45.190 --> 25:46.920
Bullshit.

25:46.990 --> 25:48.690
What doctor did you see?

25:48.760 --> 25:50.330
Three of them.

25:54.630 --> 25:55.660
Fuck.

25:57.700 --> 25:59.070
What are the options?

26:00.840 --> 26:02.340
Out of options.

26:03.840 --> 26:04.840
Surgery?

26:04.910 --> 26:06.140
No time.

26:07.240 --> 26:09.950
Okay, so then,
uh... then chemo.

26:10.010 --> 26:11.350
It's spread.

26:12.610 --> 26:13.720
It's everywhere.

26:15.350 --> 26:16.650
Dying's expensive.

26:16.720 --> 26:18.890
Insurance covers shit.

26:18.950 --> 26:22.090
I'm sure as hell not gonna
leave my wife and kid
homeless and destitute,

26:22.160 --> 26:23.690
that's a fuckin' guarantee.

26:26.560 --> 26:28.530
Yesterday in the bar,
when Frank was talking about

26:28.600 --> 26:30.170
preferring to die
in the line of duty

26:30.230 --> 26:32.530
'cause it would pump up
his life insurance

26:32.600 --> 26:36.170
and benefit his kids,
it made sense.

26:36.910 --> 26:38.170
It made a lot of sense.

26:40.980 --> 26:42.580
I'm gonna go down the street.

26:44.180 --> 26:45.380
What?

26:45.450 --> 26:48.280
Listen, I'm gonna
need your help.

26:49.750 --> 26:51.490
He's dying. I'm dying.

26:51.550 --> 26:56.190
If I can get Se√±or
to take me out
in the line of duty,

26:56.260 --> 26:58.290
my family get
a million bucks.

27:01.200 --> 27:02.200
What the fuck?

27:02.760 --> 27:04.630
What are you
talking about, man?

27:05.670 --> 27:08.570
And you... you want
my help with that?

27:08.640 --> 27:09.770
No, fuck that.

27:10.840 --> 27:12.170
He's an informant.

27:12.240 --> 27:15.880
Only you know he's
an informant. Only you.

27:17.710 --> 27:19.580
This is fucking...
this is crazy.

27:19.650 --> 27:21.380
Do you hear what
you're asking me to do?

27:21.450 --> 27:25.050
- Yeah, I do.
- Yeah, well, the answer's no.

27:25.120 --> 27:27.720
- Fuck, no.
- It's for my family.

27:28.660 --> 27:31.130
You know what?
Fuck you, Tommy.

27:46.440 --> 27:49.080
Yo, I ain't got no business
with you, bro. Fuck.

27:49.140 --> 27:51.150
I ain't your bro, man.

27:51.210 --> 27:52.750
I see you talking
to Five-O over there.

27:52.810 --> 27:54.950
Shit. Five-O just
run up on me.

27:55.620 --> 27:57.550
I-- I ain't got shit.
I know you've seen it.

27:57.620 --> 27:59.820
What I seen was they ain't
searched your ass.

28:01.620 --> 28:04.160
Matter of fact, I think
that they hit you off.

28:06.800 --> 28:07.900
Fucking snitch!

28:28.450 --> 28:30.220
Clock's ticking now, bro.

28:45.270 --> 28:46.600
- Is it good?
- Mm-hmm.

28:46.670 --> 28:48.570
- Oh, good.
- Delicious as usual.

28:48.640 --> 28:51.110
- Yay.
- I gotta split.

28:51.170 --> 28:52.570
Mm.

28:52.640 --> 28:54.480
Have a good day.
I love you.

28:54.540 --> 28:56.480
I love you too. Okay.
See you, buddy.

29:06.120 --> 29:08.220
That's the proposal for you.

29:08.290 --> 29:09.520
Uh, yeah, I'm down.

29:10.330 --> 29:14.760
Um... You, uh, you remember
that money house I--
I told y'all about?

29:17.100 --> 29:20.670
We do that money house, send--
send that dough to San Juan,

29:20.740 --> 29:23.140
and, um, yeah, we got a deal.

29:23.210 --> 29:24.840
Are you sure
he's alone up there?

29:25.770 --> 29:27.110
Yeah, man.

29:27.180 --> 29:30.680
Oh, and, and he knows
where your boy Chayo is at.

29:33.720 --> 29:35.420
Just give us the address.

29:41.320 --> 29:42.890
<i>Moran was dying.</i>

29:43.690 --> 29:47.960
<i>For most guys, that would mean</i>
<i>collapsing in a puddle</i>
<i>of tears and whining.</i>

29:48.830 --> 29:52.240
<i>But in Moran's case,</i>
<i>it just made him crazy brave.</i>

29:53.500 --> 29:54.870
<i>We had a lead on a money house</i>

29:54.940 --> 29:56.670
<i>that might bring us</i>
<i>one step closer</i>

29:56.740 --> 29:59.310
<i>to taking down the cop killer.</i>

29:59.370 --> 30:00.810
<i>We had to go for it.</i>

30:01.680 --> 30:04.110
<i>Moran wasn't taking no</i>
<i>for an answer.</i>

30:14.590 --> 30:15.760
They're awake.

30:16.590 --> 30:19.860
Yeah, well, it ain't like
he's gotta get up for work
in the morning.

30:40.920 --> 30:42.020
<i>Polic√≠a!</i>

30:43.420 --> 30:45.490
Where's Chayo?

32:25.650 --> 32:27.590
They're going through
the fucking fire escape!

32:47.310 --> 32:48.710
Fuck!

33:13.340 --> 33:15.240
Perseverance keeps honor bright.

33:16.470 --> 33:18.910
So, what do you got?

33:18.970 --> 33:22.380
Two male whites with ski masks
crashed the victim's door.

33:22.910 --> 33:25.010
They know exactly
where the money is.

33:25.080 --> 33:26.250
They didn't kill anyone.

33:27.480 --> 33:28.990
You figured
they were cops, yeah?

33:29.050 --> 33:32.620
They spoke bad Spanish,
but I'd say it's possible.

33:35.160 --> 33:37.260
Drug dealers rip
each other off all the time.

33:38.530 --> 33:42.500
And it's easy to get
a police jacket
in any uniform store in Midtown.

33:43.500 --> 33:45.630
Don't drool over
this one just yet.

33:45.700 --> 33:47.270
Belief's a graveyard.

33:51.110 --> 33:52.940
Oh, Bureau called.

33:53.510 --> 33:56.380
They have that police-involved
shooting coverage on next week.

33:57.010 --> 33:59.150
Boy, I'm looking
forward to that.

34:00.220 --> 34:01.250
Thank you, sir.

34:03.320 --> 34:04.550
Thank you.

34:07.120 --> 34:09.990
You need some blood
in your alcohol stream.

34:10.060 --> 34:11.460
Here. Eat this.

34:31.610 --> 34:32.980
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

34:40.060 --> 34:42.690
Am I supposed to eat this
with my hands or what?

35:06.580 --> 35:10.390
The wife's worried about
your drinking and your health.

35:10.450 --> 35:12.250
The irony.

35:12.950 --> 35:15.360
Maybe you should give it
a rest or give re--

35:26.440 --> 35:27.640
Give rehab another shot.

35:27.700 --> 35:29.640
Come on, man. I'm fine.

35:29.700 --> 35:31.110
You're not fine.

35:32.010 --> 35:34.210
I didn't save your life
so you could fuck it up again.

35:37.710 --> 35:39.320
Look, I got, uh...

35:40.120 --> 35:41.250
I got 12K...

35:42.280 --> 35:43.350
in savings.

35:43.950 --> 35:45.920
I know it's not a lot,
but it's yours.

35:48.320 --> 35:50.290
I appreciate it. I do.

35:53.660 --> 35:57.130
I can't do this...
without you.

36:02.040 --> 36:03.840
It's not over till it's over.

36:08.910 --> 36:10.280
- Mike.
- See you later.

36:15.420 --> 36:16.520
Whoa.

36:17.120 --> 36:20.390
Two drug dealers got ripped off
by two guys posing as cops?

36:21.260 --> 36:24.360
Yeah. So be prepared
for IAB snooping around.

36:25.760 --> 36:27.600
Does your CI have
anything on Chayo?

36:28.160 --> 36:31.070
No. He's gone away for a week.

36:31.130 --> 36:33.070
I don't know where
the fucker's gone.

36:33.970 --> 36:35.240
Gone away?

36:36.040 --> 36:38.440
Yeah, gone away.
To the fucking Bahamas.

36:39.140 --> 36:41.740
He's at an all-inclusive
shooting gallery.

36:43.110 --> 36:46.550
I know where his <i>bodegais at.</i>
We can maybe do an OP,

36:46.620 --> 36:48.280
see if we can grab somebody.

36:48.350 --> 36:50.320
Good. Do that.

36:50.390 --> 36:52.420
You got rid of the jacket
and the mask?

36:53.120 --> 36:55.960
Yeah. What are we gonna do
about the money?

36:56.030 --> 36:58.260
Mail it to him,
like he said.

37:00.600 --> 37:03.000
Do you really still wanna
go through with this?

37:04.570 --> 37:05.730
Yes.

37:23.450 --> 37:26.320
<i>Tom was asking me</i>
<i>to put my neck in a noose.</i>

37:29.230 --> 37:30.990
<i>But how could I turn him down?</i>

37:32.060 --> 37:33.760
<i>He saved my fucking life.</i>

37:40.070 --> 37:42.670
<i>Talk about being between</i>
<i>a rock and a hard place.</i>

37:43.340 --> 37:46.910
<i>When everything's wrong,</i>
<i>that's when life sucks.</i>

37:50.210 --> 37:52.980
Get in! Now!

38:03.690 --> 38:05.360
I heard about Cotto.

38:05.430 --> 38:06.960
Your info was bad.

38:07.030 --> 38:08.800
You didn't tell us there'd be
another fucking guy

38:08.860 --> 38:10.230
in the place.

38:14.170 --> 38:16.170
I heard his stash
is gone, though.

38:19.140 --> 38:20.510
It's taken care of.

38:24.750 --> 38:25.980
I bet.

38:27.280 --> 38:28.320
Get out.

38:47.770 --> 38:49.440
Shouldn't you just take it in?

38:50.210 --> 38:51.570
Mm-hmm.

38:51.640 --> 38:54.580
And how am I gonna pay
for it, my charm?

38:54.640 --> 38:56.580
Yeah, and your good looks.

38:56.650 --> 38:58.250
Funny. Hm.

39:03.090 --> 39:05.520
Hey, what'd the doctor say?
Didn't you see him?

39:07.490 --> 39:11.130
Waiting for results.
Look, I'm fine.

39:14.430 --> 39:17.370
It's all-- it's all good.
I wouldn't worry.

39:17.430 --> 39:18.630
I always worry.

39:19.130 --> 39:21.170
I know you do.
You gotta stop anyway.

39:21.240 --> 39:24.110
I got a moonlight security
gig tonight, so, uh...

39:25.110 --> 39:26.510
So I'll see you tomorrow.

39:27.510 --> 39:28.940
Yes, you will.

39:31.450 --> 39:32.510
<i>Okay.</i>

40:03.380 --> 40:05.410
Sorry, Mike, they're
gonna cut you off.

40:06.580 --> 40:07.580
Hey.

40:12.290 --> 40:14.390
<i>It was just going</i>
<i>too far with Ginger.</i>

40:15.420 --> 40:20.000
<i>The alcohol and the drugs</i>
<i>might kill me before</i>
<i>the cancer would kill Tom.</i>

40:23.400 --> 40:25.500
<i>Shit was about to hit the fan.</i>

41:30.030 --> 41:32.130
Look, uh...

41:32.200 --> 41:34.040
You know what? I--
I've been backing off.

41:34.700 --> 41:36.670
I'm trying to put myself
in your shoes.

41:37.770 --> 41:40.510
And I'm not sure I could do
what you're doing right now,

41:41.010 --> 41:43.080
But this ain't
no bargain for me,

41:43.880 --> 41:44.910
okay?

41:44.980 --> 41:47.720
I've been having nightmares.

41:47.780 --> 41:50.720
And they're about to get
a whole lot worse after tonight.

41:50.790 --> 41:54.460
And then I'm the one
who has to face Anna and Mark.

41:56.390 --> 41:58.960
What-- what if
somebody finds out

41:59.030 --> 42:02.130
that your shooter
is our CI, huh?

42:02.200 --> 42:03.470
What then?

42:04.300 --> 42:06.770
My head will be spinning
so bad from the Q&A

42:06.840 --> 42:09.710
from the DA's office and IAB.

42:09.770 --> 42:11.670
Right? But I won't have time
to think about that

42:11.740 --> 42:14.640
because I'll be too busy
working the Chayo caper

42:14.710 --> 42:16.080
and planning your funeral.

42:17.010 --> 42:20.320
That is, until they put my ass
on ice for 25 to life.

42:21.650 --> 42:24.750
So don't act like this
is some fucking picnic for me.

42:24.820 --> 42:28.790
Because it's starting to look
a lot like you got
the easy way out by dying.

42:39.270 --> 42:41.470
You know what? Truth is...

42:43.110 --> 42:44.640
when I'm alone...

42:47.010 --> 42:48.710
it does make some sense.

42:53.280 --> 42:57.050
Having something to die for
is better than having
nothing to live for.

43:22.140 --> 43:23.410
Right on time.

43:24.610 --> 43:25.580
Here.

43:26.210 --> 43:27.520
Give this to Mark.

43:39.000 --> 43:40.300
Oh, fuck.

43:45.630 --> 43:47.300
Uh... Fuck.

43:49.740 --> 43:52.080
Fuck. Oh, fuck, man.

43:52.140 --> 43:54.580
Jesus fucking Christ,
you're fried.

43:55.180 --> 43:56.210
Man...

43:56.910 --> 43:59.210
Look, man, I-- I don't think
I can do this, bro.

43:59.280 --> 44:01.680
Fuck-- What the fuck
is wrong with you?

44:01.750 --> 44:05.150
Hey-- hey, listen. I--
I don't think I can do
this shit, man.

44:05.220 --> 44:06.490
You fucking better do it.

44:06.560 --> 44:08.490
- Chill, man. I just--
- Fuck you, man.

44:08.560 --> 44:10.290
- You faggot!
- I don't think I can
fucking do this!

44:10.360 --> 44:13.930
Fuck. Stop. Fuck!

44:14.000 --> 44:16.030
- <i>Polic√≠a.</i>
- Oh, shit.

44:16.100 --> 44:17.330
Show me your hands.

44:19.040 --> 44:20.700
Mikey!

44:23.540 --> 44:25.140
- Hey.
- Man, you-- look,
look, look-- I--

44:25.210 --> 44:26.480
What the fuck
are you doing, man?

44:26.540 --> 44:27.780
No, he just fucking
put his gun--

44:27.840 --> 44:30.310
- Drop the gun! What the...
- Fuck!

44:36.180 --> 44:38.090
- Mike. Shit!
- Drop the gun!

44:38.150 --> 44:39.890
Hey, Mikey look--

44:39.960 --> 44:42.360
- Hey, hey, hey, drop it.
- I'm sorry, man.

44:48.260 --> 44:49.430
Fuck.

44:53.270 --> 44:55.170
Alright. Fuck

44:57.840 --> 44:58.810
Tommy.

44:59.370 --> 45:00.640
Fucking, Tommy.

45:09.250 --> 45:10.420
Fuck.

45:38.580 --> 45:40.220
Finally, he, uh...

45:41.480 --> 45:43.350
came around, shooting.

45:44.790 --> 45:45.920
We exchanged...

45:49.890 --> 45:51.160
That's good for now.

45:51.730 --> 45:53.760
The DA will follow up,
then the grand jury.
I don't know.

45:53.830 --> 45:56.170
It all seems pretty
cut and dry to me.

45:56.260 --> 45:58.900
Just a few routine questions.

45:59.740 --> 46:01.340
Why were you out there again?

46:02.210 --> 46:03.940
We're working a large sale case.

46:04.440 --> 46:05.640
- For a suspected sale?
- No,

46:05.710 --> 46:07.610
but it's a drug-prone location.

46:07.680 --> 46:09.780
- For sales?
- No, for users.

46:10.510 --> 46:12.380
We're looking for intel.

46:14.280 --> 46:17.450
You know, you catch a guy using,

46:17.520 --> 46:19.690
he gives you a name,
you throw back the little fish.

46:20.160 --> 46:23.390
- So you let him go?
- I did years in narcotics.

46:23.460 --> 46:25.460
That's how it's done. Move on.

46:25.530 --> 46:27.160
Did you identify yourselves
as police?

46:27.230 --> 46:29.030
Yeah. We were doing a car stop.

46:29.560 --> 46:33.400
We said "police."
We had the light on.

46:33.470 --> 46:35.370
Yes, but you were
in plainclothes.

46:35.440 --> 46:37.710
I yelled "police" twice.

46:37.770 --> 46:39.780
Before or after the shooting?

46:40.880 --> 46:41.940
What the fuck?

46:44.080 --> 46:45.680
Lieutenant, there is no doubt

46:45.750 --> 46:47.120
that he knew we were cops.

46:47.750 --> 46:50.850
- Obviously. Learner, let's--
- I even yelled it in Spanish.

46:52.550 --> 46:53.890
<i>¬ø¬øHablas espa√±ol?</i>

46:53.960 --> 46:56.730
Yeah, just basic
street stuff, you know?

46:56.790 --> 46:59.260
"Put up your hands.
Where do you live?"

46:59.330 --> 47:00.560
We both do.

47:01.300 --> 47:02.460
Did.

47:05.770 --> 47:08.740
That's all for now, Mike.
We'll be in touch. Scram.

47:14.410 --> 47:15.840
What the hell's
the matter with you?

47:16.680 --> 47:18.010
They're standard questions.

47:18.080 --> 47:19.710
The guy just lost his partner.

47:19.780 --> 47:21.780
Exercise a little discretion.

47:47.210 --> 47:48.440
<i>Ginger,</i>

47:49.180 --> 47:50.410
<i>the alcohol,</i>

47:51.150 --> 47:52.380
<i>the drugs...</i>

47:57.520 --> 47:59.390
<i>Nothing makes sense anymore.</i>

48:07.600 --> 48:09.000
It was a beautiful service.

48:09.070 --> 48:10.330
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

48:33.220 --> 48:35.020
- Mrs. Moran?
- Yes.

48:35.090 --> 48:36.260
Kevin Hickey.

48:36.330 --> 48:38.030
Did you work with Thomas?

48:38.090 --> 48:40.100
I knew him. Yeah.

48:43.530 --> 48:45.030
You have my sincerest
sympathies.

48:45.100 --> 48:46.430
Tom was a brave man.

48:47.440 --> 48:49.840
A very decent man.

48:49.910 --> 48:53.840
Sadly, sometimes loss
shows us true value.

48:57.110 --> 48:59.580
I didn't need to lose him
to know his value.

48:59.650 --> 49:01.250
Yeah, I'm sorry. I, uh...

49:01.320 --> 49:03.750
I don't quite know
what to say at these things.

49:05.990 --> 49:07.990
I'm sorry for you
and for your son.

49:08.890 --> 49:10.260
The whole department's
behind you.

49:10.330 --> 49:11.560
Thank you.

49:16.300 --> 49:17.670
- Mrs. Moran.
- Yes.

49:17.730 --> 49:20.200
I'm Joe Mangano.
I'm your police union delegate.

49:20.900 --> 49:23.610
I imagine you're concerned
about the expenses piling up.

49:23.670 --> 49:27.180
Oh, we... we have no money.

49:27.240 --> 49:30.680
I mean, his 20,000-dollar
life insurance paid,

49:30.750 --> 49:35.320
but that doesn't cover
the back payment
on his mortgage and PSOBs

49:35.380 --> 49:36.720
not coming in for a year.

49:36.790 --> 49:38.920
We, we, we--
We can't cover this.

49:38.990 --> 49:41.720
I understand.
Believe me, I get it.

49:42.290 --> 49:44.990
And I want you to know that
we're going to cover everything.

49:46.060 --> 49:50.230
It's the least we can do
for your husband's sacrifice.

49:53.270 --> 49:54.870
If it's all right,
I would love the opportunity

49:54.940 --> 49:57.240
to explain the next steps.

49:57.310 --> 49:58.640
May I walk you out?

49:59.210 --> 50:00.180
Okay.

50:01.640 --> 50:02.880
Thank you.

50:25.500 --> 50:27.470
<i>- Gary.</i>
<i>- Mike.</i>

50:27.540 --> 50:29.010
<i>Well...</i>

50:29.070 --> 50:31.870
recovery is rarely
a straight line, brother.

50:31.940 --> 50:34.910
Every day is a new day.
Have a seat.

50:36.950 --> 50:37.980
All right.

50:39.710 --> 50:43.420
We are a fellowship
of men and women

50:43.490 --> 50:47.360
who share their
experience, strength,

50:47.420 --> 50:48.960
and hope with each other

50:49.030 --> 50:52.030
that they may solve
their common problem

50:52.090 --> 50:56.100
and help each other
to recover from alcoholism.

50:56.170 --> 50:59.300
The only requirement
for membership here

50:59.370 --> 51:01.840
is a desire to stop drinking.

51:15.920 --> 51:18.590
<i>It's Tom.</i>
<i>Leave your number.</i>

51:21.360 --> 51:22.690
<i>What time tonight?</i>

51:23.590 --> 51:24.860
<i>Give me a call.</i>

51:30.030 --> 51:32.600
Ask him if any
of these voices
sound familiar.

51:34.040 --> 51:36.770
<i>It's Tom. Leave your number.</i>

51:37.870 --> 51:39.970
<i>What time tonight?</i>

51:40.040 --> 51:41.410
<i>Give me a call.</i>

51:49.580 --> 51:52.350
He says maybe the first one,
but he's not too sure.

51:54.020 --> 51:55.620
All right.

51:55.690 --> 51:57.030
Tell him to listen again.

52:03.200 --> 52:05.200
I don't think he wants
to get involved, man.

52:06.000 --> 52:07.970
Tell him I don't care
where he got the money from.

52:08.040 --> 52:09.440
He's a fucking drug dealer.

52:09.510 --> 52:10.870
- Tell him.
- Look...

52:12.410 --> 52:13.610
I have to be here.

52:14.140 --> 52:16.110
You volunteered for this shit.

52:16.180 --> 52:17.210
Yeah, big boy.

52:17.710 --> 52:19.250
But what if these
are dirty cops?

52:19.320 --> 52:20.380
He said he doesn't know.

52:21.180 --> 52:24.320
Look, you're on your
own crusade, white knight.

52:25.390 --> 52:26.620
I'm done.

52:36.800 --> 52:38.070
Hey, Mike, got a minute?

52:38.870 --> 52:41.970
Um... I'm not gonna make
a whole big how-to-do about it,

52:42.040 --> 52:44.310
'cause I'm sure you wanna
move on with things,

52:44.370 --> 52:45.870
um, but just...

52:45.940 --> 52:48.710
we-- we want you to know
that we're glad you're back.

52:52.550 --> 52:54.150
So, uh, just to...

52:55.180 --> 52:57.420
...bring you up to speed, um,

52:57.490 --> 53:00.760
I ran the perp from
your shooting, um, to see
if there was a connection.

53:02.490 --> 53:04.430
Jenny asked you to run him?

53:04.490 --> 53:05.930
No, I mean, he was a user,

53:06.000 --> 53:08.260
and your shooting wasn't far
from the <i>bodega,</i>

53:08.330 --> 53:10.700
so I thought maybe,
but that really doesn't matter,

53:10.770 --> 53:13.440
because it was a dead end,
so he's out.

53:13.970 --> 53:15.840
We did get some
surveillance photos,

53:15.900 --> 53:17.970
and we're hoping that
Chayo's one of them.

53:18.040 --> 53:20.640
And, uh, we're gonna try
a buy attempt in the hallway

53:20.710 --> 53:22.340
that Jimmy O's trying to set up.

53:22.410 --> 53:26.180
And we'll see what happens
from there.

53:31.120 --> 53:33.290
What's up?

53:33.360 --> 53:35.890
I have a couple
of old complaints
on you and your partner.

53:35.960 --> 53:39.430
Now, I don't wanna
bring you down officially
in light of what's happened.

53:40.200 --> 53:42.200
Thing is, I still need
to address them.

53:43.300 --> 53:48.070
I don't know, maybe if I knew
a few things off the record,
we could squash this, huh?

53:48.140 --> 53:50.140
Is there something
you wanna ask me?

53:50.210 --> 53:52.340
'Cause just come
right out and ask it.

53:55.840 --> 54:00.950
No disrespect, but, um,
was your partner
having financial problems?

54:01.980 --> 54:04.590
This is, uh...
this is off the record?

54:04.650 --> 54:05.920
Of course.

54:06.960 --> 54:10.890
Oh, off the record.
Go fuck yourself.

54:12.460 --> 54:14.000
And no disrespect.

54:15.500 --> 54:16.730
Of course.

54:32.080 --> 54:34.450
Anna, just relax.

54:36.690 --> 54:38.090
He talked more to you?

54:39.390 --> 54:42.420
It's, uh, it's a cop thing,
you know?

54:43.190 --> 54:47.230
No one, uh, can understand you
like another cop.

54:48.630 --> 54:49.800
Well...

54:51.330 --> 54:53.270
maybe you know more
about him than I do.

54:56.470 --> 54:57.540
What are you getting at?

55:05.450 --> 55:07.780
Was Tommy taking money
on the side?

55:08.450 --> 55:10.120
Never. No.

55:12.250 --> 55:14.520
If he was, Mike,
I have a right to know.

55:14.590 --> 55:16.730
Anna, think about it.

55:16.790 --> 55:18.390
If-- if he was taking money,

55:19.160 --> 55:23.430
don't you think you and Mark
would have everything
you needed and wanted?

55:23.500 --> 55:25.400
- Yeah.
- What about that shit box
he was driving,

55:25.470 --> 55:29.000
held together with bubble gum
and rubber bands, huh?

55:32.810 --> 55:34.240
And where's this coming from?

55:36.110 --> 55:40.280
I don't know.
Someone just came around
and they were asking questions.

55:40.850 --> 55:42.150
The IA guy?

55:42.850 --> 55:44.450
- Learner?
- Yeah.

55:46.890 --> 55:47.860
Look.

55:48.490 --> 55:50.990
There were these drug dealers.
They lied.

55:51.060 --> 55:53.460
They said we ripped them off.
That's it.

55:54.300 --> 55:56.270
I just buried my husband.

55:59.000 --> 56:00.700
Do I deserve a little peace?

56:00.770 --> 56:02.740
Yes. Yes.

56:03.270 --> 56:05.270
You do, and you will have it.

56:06.040 --> 56:08.640
And that guy,
he won't mess with you again.

56:08.710 --> 56:10.180
I promise you that.

56:16.320 --> 56:17.350
Thank you.

56:42.110 --> 56:44.150
Take a look at the yellow
and tell me what you make
of that shit.

56:45.780 --> 56:48.080
Hey, you wanna play games?

56:48.150 --> 56:49.550
Okay, you play with me.

56:49.620 --> 56:53.520
You leave Moran's family
out of it, understand?

56:55.790 --> 56:59.600
God, it is dangerous
to be you in this world
right now, Learner.

57:04.270 --> 57:06.600
Seems pretty upset for a guy
who's done nothing wrong.

57:06.670 --> 57:08.640
Yeah, I wouldn't push
the envelope.

57:08.700 --> 57:11.410
He's got the personality
of a landmine right now.

57:13.140 --> 57:14.610
We've been told.

57:20.420 --> 57:23.720
Hey, why is Tom's locker
empty right now?

57:23.790 --> 57:26.590
Take it easy.
Learner took it.

57:27.020 --> 57:29.160
He's playing his game.

57:29.220 --> 57:31.430
When he doesn't find shit,
he'll bring it back.

57:31.490 --> 57:32.590
Moving on.

57:34.300 --> 57:37.570
We're gonna try to make
a buy attempt in that lobby

57:38.600 --> 57:40.770
to try to get a pipeline
into Chayo.

57:40.840 --> 57:42.340
I need you on point.

57:43.240 --> 57:44.940
So I'm asking you...

57:45.010 --> 57:46.610
Yeah, I'm good, boss.

57:48.110 --> 57:49.650
- I'm good.
- Okay.

57:57.820 --> 58:00.590
I'm thinking Moran
and Thornton might be good

58:00.660 --> 58:02.220
for impersonation robbery.

58:03.790 --> 58:05.160
Because?

58:05.230 --> 58:07.260
They're narcotics.
They know the players.

58:07.700 --> 58:09.830
Moran was buried
in bills and expenses.

58:09.900 --> 58:11.900
His house was in foreclosure.

58:11.970 --> 58:14.140
- And?
- It's motive.

58:14.200 --> 58:16.270
Hell, if that's a motive,
I'm a suspect.

58:16.340 --> 58:18.410
They both spoke broken Spanish.

58:18.970 --> 58:20.710
The victim,
to the perp's Spanish,

58:20.780 --> 58:22.410
was white boy-like.

58:22.480 --> 58:25.210
I re-interviewed them, they said
he could be Moran and Thornton.

58:25.280 --> 58:27.480
Everybody speaks broken--
Hey, wait a minute.

58:28.350 --> 58:31.650
You're saying the victim
somehow heard Moran
and-- and Thornton speak,

58:31.720 --> 58:33.820
and since then they made
some kind of voice comparison?

58:33.890 --> 58:35.120
How'd you manage that?

58:36.460 --> 58:37.560
I'm resourceful.

58:38.560 --> 58:40.460
That's a stretch.

58:40.530 --> 58:42.260
That's a lot
of what-ifs, Learner.

58:44.470 --> 58:45.930
Don't open up a can of worms

58:46.000 --> 58:48.840
on the say-so
of a drug dealer, okay?

58:48.900 --> 58:51.310
If I know anything
about that pair,
they can keep a secret.

58:51.370 --> 58:53.140
They've been joined at the hip
since Desert Storm,

58:53.210 --> 58:54.640
and one of them
ain't talking at all.

58:55.480 --> 58:57.280
See, what you got here
is a tinderbox.

58:57.880 --> 59:00.550
You got a dead cop,
a hero partner, and a widow.

59:01.150 --> 59:05.120
If you're wrong about this,
that jarhead is gonna stick
his foot so far up your ass,

59:05.190 --> 59:07.160
and there'll probably be
a line behind him.

59:09.490 --> 59:11.690
All right. Well,
the next thing I plan is--

59:11.760 --> 59:13.230
Close-- close the door.

59:15.000 --> 59:17.970
No, don't. You'll be
on the other side of the door
when you close it.

59:18.070 --> 59:19.270
Got it.

59:32.210 --> 59:33.650
Okay. Okay.

59:36.150 --> 59:38.390
Oh, shit.

59:39.860 --> 59:42.160
No, no, no. There goes Five-O.

59:42.220 --> 59:43.490
I told you it's gonna be
fucking hot out here.

59:43.560 --> 59:45.090
I ain't doing no sale
in the streets.

59:45.160 --> 59:46.090
All right, let's do
this quick, then.

59:46.160 --> 59:47.830
Without a doubt, son.

59:47.900 --> 59:49.130
You know?

59:54.840 --> 59:57.010
10-4. 2-5-5. Lobby out.

59:57.070 --> 01:00:00.340
<i>What's fucking</i>
<i>Learner doing here</i>
<i>in his black cop car?</i>

01:00:13.090 --> 01:00:15.420
It's a rip-off,
move in, move in.

01:00:16.830 --> 01:00:21.030
<i>2-5, that's your radio.</i>
<i>You're breaking up.</i>

01:00:21.100 --> 01:00:23.030
Get down there, 2-5-5.

01:00:28.670 --> 01:00:31.110
Hey, hey, hey, hey, <i>Papi,</i>
what's with the biscuit, man?

01:00:31.170 --> 01:00:33.140
Yo. Yo, can you help me out?

01:00:34.280 --> 01:00:36.140
- Fuckin' bum!
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

01:00:47.260 --> 01:00:48.890
- Give me your hand.
- Don't fucking move!

01:00:53.900 --> 01:00:55.960
- Give me your hand.
- Don't you fucking move!

01:00:56.030 --> 01:00:58.930
- Turn around!
- I got him, I got him,
I got him.

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:00.070
- Come on.
- Hey.

01:01:01.840 --> 01:01:03.040
Everybody okay?

01:01:03.110 --> 01:01:04.010
- Yeah, boss. We're good.
- Yeah.

01:01:04.540 --> 01:01:07.610
What in the fuck
were you thinking? Huh?

01:01:07.680 --> 01:01:09.680
Another cop almost got killed.

01:01:09.750 --> 01:01:12.410
You had no business
tailing them on a buy.

01:01:12.480 --> 01:01:14.150
And here's another question
for you, Detective.

01:01:14.220 --> 01:01:17.390
It's a police operation.
Cops are involved.
Shots are fired.

01:01:17.450 --> 01:01:20.960
And you don't even bother
to get out of your car
to see if they're okay?

01:01:21.560 --> 01:01:23.890
- I fucked up.
- You bet you fucked up.

01:01:23.960 --> 01:01:26.260
You're not to follow them
anymore. You got that?

01:01:26.330 --> 01:01:27.600
If I can't follow him,

01:01:28.160 --> 01:01:30.830
I'm gonna need to get
into the confidential
informant files.

01:01:31.370 --> 01:01:33.470
Well, that's fairly impossible.
What the fuck for?

01:01:33.540 --> 01:01:36.870
These two cops have more CIs
than anyone on their team.

01:01:36.940 --> 01:01:38.370
The perps from this robbery

01:01:38.440 --> 01:01:40.740
knew exactly where
the money was hidden.

01:01:40.810 --> 01:01:42.180
Now, I have a feeling

01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:43.310
that they're either using
CI information

01:01:43.380 --> 01:01:44.680
or that the shooter is either--

01:01:44.750 --> 01:01:46.950
All you got is conjecture,
all right?

01:01:47.020 --> 01:01:49.550
My gut is right on this, sir.

01:01:50.150 --> 01:01:53.020
Why are you defensive of him?
Why do you keep shutting me out?

01:01:53.090 --> 01:01:55.890
Ah, you hold your horses, pal.
You watch those accusations.

01:01:55.960 --> 01:01:57.390
I'll tell you
what you're gonna do.

01:01:57.460 --> 01:01:58.790
You're gonna
interview Thornton.

01:01:58.860 --> 01:02:00.660
You're gonna close
this thing up, okay?

01:02:00.730 --> 01:02:02.660
Just your basic
fucking police work.

01:02:02.730 --> 01:02:04.370
- Is this police work?
- Yeah.

01:02:04.430 --> 01:02:06.100
Turning a deaf ear
to your subordinate

01:02:06.170 --> 01:02:09.370
when he's telling you that
he may have legit corruption.

01:02:09.440 --> 01:02:12.740
Closing a blind eye
to the evidence he presents you.

01:02:13.210 --> 01:02:14.680
Learner, you're about
an inch away

01:02:14.740 --> 01:02:16.480
from getting bounced
out of the IAB,

01:02:16.550 --> 01:02:18.210
and that's pretty tough to do.

01:02:18.280 --> 01:02:21.520
But you're also a cunt hair away
from getting your ass kicked.

01:02:21.580 --> 01:02:23.020
Why do you want him so bad?

01:02:23.090 --> 01:02:24.490
I don't know what
you're talking about, sir.

01:02:24.550 --> 01:02:25.920
- I'm just doing my job.
- No, no.

01:02:25.990 --> 01:02:27.960
You've had a hard-on for him
from the start.

01:02:28.020 --> 01:02:29.320
Now, why is that?

01:02:31.690 --> 01:02:33.530
They don't follow
the rules, sir.

01:02:35.400 --> 01:02:37.000
They do whatever
the hell they want.

01:02:38.700 --> 01:02:40.540
Guys like that,

01:02:40.600 --> 01:02:42.240
they give the department
a bad name.

01:02:42.740 --> 01:02:45.570
Guys like that made this
department what it is today.

01:02:47.340 --> 01:02:48.510
Yeah.

01:03:00.620 --> 01:03:02.660
Have a seat, gentlemen.

01:03:02.720 --> 01:03:04.160
- Mike.
- Lieutenant.

01:03:04.230 --> 01:03:05.560
Hickey. How are you?

01:03:07.330 --> 01:03:09.070
Well, sit down. Yeah.

01:03:10.870 --> 01:03:13.700
All right, oh, where's that
damn tape? Oh, here it is.

01:03:14.840 --> 01:03:15.800
Okay.

01:03:16.940 --> 01:03:18.010
Here we go. Now...

01:03:20.010 --> 01:03:21.540
I'm sure we have got
better things to do,

01:03:21.610 --> 01:03:23.380
so let's just jump
right into this.

01:03:23.450 --> 01:03:24.980
- Everybody ready?
- Yeah.

01:03:25.780 --> 01:03:26.750
Okay.

01:03:28.050 --> 01:03:29.190
Uh...

01:03:29.850 --> 01:03:32.850
Have you ever loaned
your partner
a large sum of money?

01:03:34.360 --> 01:03:36.560
Uh, what's a large sum?

01:03:37.590 --> 01:03:39.000
A thousand bucks?

01:03:39.060 --> 01:03:42.230
I see he was in quite
the financial bind.

01:03:42.800 --> 01:03:44.900
- Is that a question?
- It's a fact.

01:03:45.600 --> 01:03:47.670
Detective Moran's
financial status

01:03:47.740 --> 01:03:51.140
has no bearing on allegations
against Detective Thornton.

01:03:51.210 --> 01:03:52.810
Do you know how much we make?

01:03:52.870 --> 01:03:55.010
Learner, can we get
to the point?

01:03:57.080 --> 01:04:01.250
Did you or your partner
ever meet a CI
outside of the job?

01:04:01.320 --> 01:04:03.090
No. Never.

01:04:04.290 --> 01:04:06.560
Outside of drug houses,

01:04:06.620 --> 01:04:08.960
has a CI ever informed you
about money spots?

01:04:09.790 --> 01:04:12.330
That's not enough for an arrest
or a search warrant,

01:04:12.390 --> 01:04:16.030
so what good
is that info to us?

01:04:16.100 --> 01:04:19.000
- That's what I'd like to know.
- All right, that's enough.

01:04:19.870 --> 01:04:22.740
Hickey, if this keeps up,
we're filing a grievance

01:04:22.800 --> 01:04:26.010
to the accusatory tone
of your investigator.

01:04:26.580 --> 01:04:28.310
I mean, you're not
investigating allegations.

01:04:28.380 --> 01:04:29.980
You're making accusations.

01:04:30.050 --> 01:04:31.850
Duly noted. Move on.

01:04:34.080 --> 01:04:36.120
Have you seen Mrs. Moran
since the shooting?

01:04:36.190 --> 01:04:38.990
What the fuck does that
have to do with anything, huh?

01:04:39.060 --> 01:04:40.790
If your all so close,

01:04:40.860 --> 01:04:42.760
and I know you spend nights
over there on occasions.

01:04:42.820 --> 01:04:45.030
Ah, Learner, where do you get
the balls for this?

01:04:45.090 --> 01:04:46.530
Come on, can we move on?

01:04:53.070 --> 01:04:54.770
Can you explain this?

01:04:55.740 --> 01:04:57.510
I make it to be a ski mask.

01:04:59.570 --> 01:05:01.880
I found that
in your partner's locker.

01:05:03.410 --> 01:05:04.810
Says you.

01:05:05.380 --> 01:05:08.380
It was obtained during
an ongoing internal
affairs investigation.

01:05:08.450 --> 01:05:10.620
Then why isn't it vouchered?

01:05:11.320 --> 01:05:12.690
Excuse me?

01:05:12.750 --> 01:05:15.020
Well, it should be
in a property envelope

01:05:15.090 --> 01:05:16.360
with a voucher attached

01:05:16.420 --> 01:05:19.030
marked as investigatory evidence

01:05:19.100 --> 01:05:22.430
in order to, you know,
ensure the chain of evidence.

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.100
I mean, you could have bought
that on the way over here.

01:05:25.170 --> 01:05:26.430
Okay, I'm wrapping this up.

01:05:26.500 --> 01:05:27.740
That's enough
of that. All right.

01:05:28.240 --> 01:05:30.070
It's okay. He's just
playing at being a cop

01:05:30.140 --> 01:05:31.970
'cause he's never
actually been one.

01:05:32.040 --> 01:05:34.480
I got nothing
to hide, so...

01:05:35.740 --> 01:05:37.180
You got nothing to hide?

01:05:38.410 --> 01:05:40.980
Then let me ask you something,

01:05:41.680 --> 01:05:44.390
- off the record, of course.
- Sure.

01:05:44.450 --> 01:05:46.590
But remember, last time.

01:05:47.890 --> 01:05:50.230
You still fucking
your dead partner's wife?

01:05:50.290 --> 01:05:51.660
- Okay. Mike!
- Mike.

01:05:51.730 --> 01:05:53.330
- I fucking warned you!
- Forget it. Forget it.

01:05:53.400 --> 01:05:55.230
Forget it. Go on.
Go on. Fuck him.

01:05:55.900 --> 01:05:57.870
- Did you hear what he said?
- I don't give a rat's ass.

01:05:57.930 --> 01:05:59.470
This is still an investigation

01:05:59.530 --> 01:06:01.370
and you never raise
your hands, right?

01:06:01.440 --> 01:06:04.070
Hickey. Asshole.

01:06:05.540 --> 01:06:06.780
What the fuck was that?

01:06:07.440 --> 01:06:11.010
I wanted to send him
over the edge,
make him come clean.

01:06:11.080 --> 01:06:12.680
Come clean about what?

01:06:12.750 --> 01:06:14.120
I know he's dirty.

01:06:14.880 --> 01:06:16.990
You've jeopardized
other cops' lives.

01:06:17.050 --> 01:06:19.790
They're definitely gonna file
a grievance against us.

01:06:19.850 --> 01:06:22.460
You jackpotted your own career,
and worst of all,

01:06:22.520 --> 01:06:24.290
I'm gonna get one up the ass.

01:06:25.030 --> 01:06:27.730
This investigation is over.
I'm keeping the tape.

01:06:29.500 --> 01:06:31.030
Are you gonna let
this assault go?

01:06:31.100 --> 01:06:33.940
Buddy, for a minute,
I almost helped him.

01:06:36.140 --> 01:06:40.180
Kid from the hallway gave up
what might be Chayo's main digs.

01:06:42.450 --> 01:06:45.580
<i>Catching Chayo</i>
<i>was Moran's last wish.</i>

01:06:46.580 --> 01:06:48.350
Talk to me, Harnischer.
What's going on?

01:06:56.160 --> 01:06:57.490
I don't see the fucker.

01:06:57.560 --> 01:06:59.030
<i>No sign of our subject?</i>

01:07:02.230 --> 01:07:05.030
Be advised, Leader, no sign
of our subject as of yet.

01:07:06.370 --> 01:07:08.040
10-4. Keep an eye on him.

01:07:12.270 --> 01:07:14.310
Tell him to keep watching.

01:07:14.380 --> 01:07:16.010
He's gonna fall asleep.

01:07:19.050 --> 01:07:20.220
Detective Cruz.

01:07:23.990 --> 01:07:25.320
Detective Cruz.

01:07:26.060 --> 01:07:27.990
- What can I do for you?
- I need some information

01:07:28.060 --> 01:07:30.090
pertaining to
a registered informant.

01:07:30.160 --> 01:07:32.130
I think you might have
something I need.

01:07:46.570 --> 01:07:48.010
Where the fuck is he?

01:07:48.940 --> 01:07:50.850
10-4. Keep an eye on him.

01:07:50.910 --> 01:07:52.780
Ohh...

01:07:52.850 --> 01:07:54.850
I think our man just showed up.

01:07:58.520 --> 01:08:00.120
Be advised,
subject just arrived.

01:08:00.190 --> 01:08:01.160
Yeah.

01:08:02.160 --> 01:08:03.460
There you are.

01:08:03.530 --> 01:08:05.530
Okay, subject
at location now.

01:08:05.590 --> 01:08:07.160
Nice. He's got him.

01:08:17.670 --> 01:08:20.340
I need this information,
<i>por favor.</i>

01:08:22.780 --> 01:08:26.220
You need a request
from your CO stating why.

01:08:26.280 --> 01:08:27.380
Hold on.

01:08:27.450 --> 01:08:29.450
And if a judge approves it,

01:08:29.520 --> 01:08:31.820
I will notify you.

01:08:31.890 --> 01:08:34.320
Those files are very sensitive.

01:08:35.860 --> 01:08:39.160
You live in Queens, right?

01:08:39.230 --> 01:08:40.260
What's this about?

01:08:41.160 --> 01:08:44.200
Your auto insurance here says
that you live in, uh...

01:08:45.300 --> 01:08:46.600
New Jersey.

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.510
Heh. Wasn't that something?

01:08:51.140 --> 01:08:52.970
Close enough to commute
to the city,

01:08:53.040 --> 01:08:57.210
yet far enough away for a drop
in your insurance premium.

01:08:58.380 --> 01:08:59.810
Wow.

01:09:01.180 --> 01:09:02.420
Excuse me?

01:09:02.490 --> 01:09:03.990
In this crazy city,

01:09:04.050 --> 01:09:07.390
you have nothing better to do
than mess with me.

01:09:08.020 --> 01:09:09.820
Which way would
those files be?

01:09:12.860 --> 01:09:14.800
- <i>Gracias.</i>
- Mm.

01:09:26.440 --> 01:09:27.680
Who's the guy?

01:09:29.450 --> 01:09:30.410
Gotcha.

01:09:36.190 --> 01:09:37.350
<i>Gracias.</i>

01:09:38.120 --> 01:09:40.260
Talk to me, Harnischer.
What's going on?

01:09:42.320 --> 01:09:44.960
- What's going on?
- Shh, shh. You hear that shit?

01:09:45.030 --> 01:09:46.960
Is there a back door
to this building?

01:09:47.030 --> 01:09:49.000
You're gonna have
to repeat later. There's
a motorcycle buzzing around.

01:09:49.060 --> 01:09:50.770
Take a plate
on that motorcycle.

01:10:08.020 --> 01:10:10.390
- What's this fucking guy doing?
- What the fuck?

01:10:27.300 --> 01:10:29.770
Talk to me,
Harnischer! Kurt?

01:10:34.240 --> 01:10:35.740
Oh, fuck!

01:10:39.550 --> 01:10:44.790
10-13, Central. 10-13.
Shots fired. 357-1457 Street.

01:11:32.030 --> 01:11:34.370
You know the policy
on vehicle pursuits?

01:11:34.440 --> 01:11:36.710
We shouldn't have even been
out there in the first place.

01:11:36.770 --> 01:11:38.370
We're so undermanned.

01:11:38.440 --> 01:11:40.510
Well, then why were you?

01:11:40.580 --> 01:11:43.380
- Your guy is very fortunate.
- Fortunate?

01:11:43.450 --> 01:11:45.410
He's in critical
but stable condition.

01:11:45.480 --> 01:11:47.180
What's that mean, Doc?

01:11:47.250 --> 01:11:49.420
It means he got shot
in the liver.

01:11:49.490 --> 01:11:52.390
Lost a lot of blood.
Doesn't look very lethal,
but that could change.

01:11:52.450 --> 01:11:54.420
- Did you recover the bullet?
- You kidding?

01:11:54.490 --> 01:11:56.590
A lot of blood in there.
We were packing the liver.

01:11:56.660 --> 01:11:58.190
I mean, if we saw it,
we could have grabbed it.

01:11:58.260 --> 01:12:00.100
What, is it still in there?

01:12:00.160 --> 01:12:02.030
Yeah, I mean, the area
where he got shot,

01:12:02.100 --> 01:12:03.770
the bullet's caught
between three blood vessels.

01:12:03.830 --> 01:12:05.530
We call it the Bermuda Triangle.

01:12:05.600 --> 01:12:08.200
Unless he got a clear shot,
we wouldn't go after it.

01:12:08.270 --> 01:12:10.010
Is he gonna be okay with that?

01:12:10.070 --> 01:12:11.740
Sure, unless you're worried
about lead poisoning.

01:12:11.810 --> 01:12:14.080
Usually, going after a bullet
is more trouble than it's worth.

01:12:14.140 --> 01:12:16.940
- Trust me.
- Oh, we don't need
the evidence.

01:12:17.010 --> 01:12:18.550
We know who shot him.

01:12:18.610 --> 01:12:19.950
Later on, when he wakes up,

01:12:20.020 --> 01:12:21.550
you can send your team in
to see him.

01:12:24.290 --> 01:12:27.320
I wouldn't let that motherfucker
nab me with a scalpel.

01:12:30.360 --> 01:12:33.060
Here he comes.
Don't give him anything.

01:12:33.600 --> 01:12:34.560
Mike,

01:12:35.100 --> 01:12:37.170
I have to place you
on suspension.

01:12:38.130 --> 01:12:40.040
We should wait
for Mike's delegate.

01:12:40.100 --> 01:12:41.540
Doesn't matter at this point.

01:12:43.010 --> 01:12:44.110
What are the charges?

01:12:44.640 --> 01:12:46.480
Fraternizing with
confidential informants

01:12:46.540 --> 01:12:49.980
outside of departmental
guidelines, for starters.

01:12:50.050 --> 01:12:51.610
I need your gun and your shield.

01:12:55.320 --> 01:12:58.890
I'd rather give them
to a real cop
than an empty suit.

01:13:00.960 --> 01:13:02.120
Mike,

01:13:03.590 --> 01:13:04.860
watch yourself.

01:13:08.160 --> 01:13:09.730
Be advised,
Sergeant Sullivan,

01:13:10.330 --> 01:13:12.800
once these two are found
guilty of wrongdoing,

01:13:12.900 --> 01:13:14.270
charges will be brought
against you

01:13:14.340 --> 01:13:15.770
for failure to supervise.

01:13:15.840 --> 01:13:17.870
Back the fuck off.

01:13:36.560 --> 01:13:38.560
It's over, Mike.

01:13:38.630 --> 01:13:41.330
It's Detective Thornton,
you fucking prick.

01:13:42.960 --> 01:13:44.300
Not anymore.

01:13:48.140 --> 01:13:49.610
I've seen your records.

01:13:51.540 --> 01:13:52.640
You guys did some...

01:13:53.540 --> 01:13:54.710
Huh.

01:13:54.780 --> 01:13:56.010
Good work.

01:13:56.080 --> 01:13:57.410
A thankless job.

01:13:59.720 --> 01:14:00.680
But...

01:14:01.420 --> 01:14:04.350
somewhere along the line,
things went sideways.

01:14:08.690 --> 01:14:10.160
This won't go away.

01:14:11.890 --> 01:14:13.260
It's gonna haunt you

01:14:14.600 --> 01:14:16.230
and the Moran family.

01:14:16.300 --> 01:14:18.670
You don't know shit
about the Moran family.

01:14:23.410 --> 01:14:25.410
It's your last chance, Michael.

01:14:26.580 --> 01:14:27.710
Last chance at what?

01:14:29.610 --> 01:14:30.650
Redemption.

01:14:34.850 --> 01:14:36.080
What happened that night?

01:14:36.150 --> 01:14:37.950
I told you what happened
that night.

01:14:38.020 --> 01:14:39.790
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:14:39.860 --> 01:14:42.190
- Tell me again.
- A hero fell.

01:14:44.430 --> 01:14:47.000
Look, I know you don't wanna
destroy his legacy,

01:14:48.260 --> 01:14:50.300
but it's better this thing
comes out right,

01:14:51.430 --> 01:14:54.400
- the way you want it told.
- No.

01:14:57.870 --> 01:15:00.080
Come clean, Mike. Huh?

01:15:00.740 --> 01:15:01.780
Be honest.

01:15:02.480 --> 01:15:05.250
It's gonna come out anyway,
one way or the other.

01:15:07.220 --> 01:15:09.650
Take a shot at freedom
while you still have it.

01:15:13.290 --> 01:15:14.690
Why did Se√±or kill Moran?

01:15:14.760 --> 01:15:17.330
He's a fucking junkie.
I don't know.

01:15:17.990 --> 01:15:19.090
He was your junkie.

01:15:19.860 --> 01:15:21.830
- What did he have on you guys?
- He was high.

01:15:22.800 --> 01:15:25.400
- Why were you out there?
- He was suicidal.
I don't fucking know.

01:15:25.470 --> 01:15:26.870
- Suicidal?
- What? Yeah.

01:15:26.940 --> 01:15:28.040
What were you doing out there?

01:15:28.100 --> 01:15:30.870
Nothing. I told you already.

01:15:30.940 --> 01:15:32.340
Why did your CI want him dead?

01:15:32.410 --> 01:15:34.210
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

01:15:34.280 --> 01:15:35.610
They're both dead.

01:15:35.680 --> 01:15:36.710
Why did he kill him?

01:15:36.780 --> 01:15:38.410
They were both already dead.

01:15:39.980 --> 01:15:41.220
All right?

01:15:46.660 --> 01:15:48.520
Se√±or was dying of AIDS.

01:15:51.060 --> 01:15:52.230
He was suicidal.

01:15:52.830 --> 01:15:55.060
He was leaving a wife
and kid destitute.

01:15:55.630 --> 01:15:58.730
And Moran, he found out
he had cancer.
He had weeks to live.

01:16:00.970 --> 01:16:04.470
We robbed that dealer
to send the money
back to Se√±or's family.

01:16:05.810 --> 01:16:09.410
At least, maybe they
would have a chance.

01:16:09.480 --> 01:16:12.020
And we staged the shooting
so Moran's family

01:16:12.080 --> 01:16:14.120
would get the full
death benefits.

01:16:20.260 --> 01:16:22.660
You know, Se√±or, he was
supposed to kill himself.

01:16:23.760 --> 01:16:26.260
But, uh...

01:16:27.030 --> 01:16:28.530
...he got scared.

01:16:28.600 --> 01:16:30.770
He couldn't do it,
so he started shooting at me.

01:16:35.500 --> 01:16:37.770
It's got a happy ending,
you know,

01:16:37.840 --> 01:16:39.610
'cause they're dead

01:16:39.680 --> 01:16:41.780
and their families
are taken care of.

01:16:44.810 --> 01:16:46.080
Are you happy now?

01:16:50.720 --> 01:16:54.120
You wanna shame a hero cop
who knew he was dying,

01:16:54.190 --> 01:16:57.560
who sacrificed his last days
on this earth with his family

01:16:57.630 --> 01:16:59.860
so he doesn't leave them
in a mess.

01:17:03.300 --> 01:17:04.800
You have at it, Learner.

01:17:06.100 --> 01:17:08.540
You couldn't shine
his fucking shoes.

01:17:37.730 --> 01:17:40.840
Congratulations, Learner.
You cracked your first case.

01:17:41.700 --> 01:17:44.840
Thank you, Lieutenant Hickey.
Learned a lot from you, sir.

01:17:44.910 --> 01:17:46.380
Hm.

01:17:47.240 --> 01:17:49.810
You knew, didn't you?

01:18:00.060 --> 01:18:01.290
Knew what?

01:18:01.820 --> 01:18:02.860
You knew.

01:18:05.530 --> 01:18:07.500
That's why you kept
trying to deter me.

01:18:16.010 --> 01:18:18.770
Yeah, I lost a partner
on the job once, you know?

01:18:20.080 --> 01:18:23.950
Over the years, I stayed
in touch with his kids, and...

01:18:24.650 --> 01:18:26.380
they're doing well.
They're happy.

01:18:27.850 --> 01:18:28.950
Seventeen years.

01:18:30.350 --> 01:18:31.890
We took care of him.

01:18:32.550 --> 01:18:33.490
Yeah.

01:18:38.160 --> 01:18:39.760
If I was in Mike's shoes,

01:18:40.930 --> 01:18:43.270
I might have done
the same thing he did.

01:18:44.800 --> 01:18:45.830
And slept well.

01:18:46.870 --> 01:18:48.940
It's our job...

01:18:49.010 --> 01:18:52.010
to protect the community,
uphold the law.

01:18:52.640 --> 01:18:54.110
They broke the rules, sir.

01:18:54.180 --> 01:18:56.310
Rules.

01:18:57.850 --> 01:18:58.950
There's no rules.

01:19:00.250 --> 01:19:05.090
These guys put their lives
on the line every single day
hunting down assholes.

01:19:05.150 --> 01:19:06.560
We sleep good at night

01:19:06.620 --> 01:19:08.460
because these guys deal
with the ugly shit,

01:19:08.520 --> 01:19:09.790
so we don't have to.

01:19:10.660 --> 01:19:12.630
That's why the rules matter.

01:19:12.690 --> 01:19:14.260
There's no room for error.

01:19:15.100 --> 01:19:16.430
An error means a funeral.

01:19:16.500 --> 01:19:17.970
That's right,
it's life or death.

01:19:18.030 --> 01:19:20.840
Strap on a bulletproof vest
for what?

01:19:21.570 --> 01:19:25.770
Shitty paycheck,
the alcoholism, the nightmares.

01:19:25.840 --> 01:19:28.040
If you're lucky,
that means you're still alive.

01:19:29.150 --> 01:19:33.520
America without cops
would be like--
like God without his angels.

01:19:35.080 --> 01:19:36.850
It's not for everyone, sir.

01:19:36.920 --> 01:19:38.290
Damn right it's not.

01:19:39.160 --> 01:19:40.520
You're so focused on the manual

01:19:40.590 --> 01:19:41.990
that you're willing
to tear down someone

01:19:42.060 --> 01:19:44.090
who's spent the last 12 years

01:19:44.160 --> 01:19:46.500
keeping the wolves at bay.

01:19:46.560 --> 01:19:48.400
I'm not trying
to tear anyone down.

01:19:49.930 --> 01:19:51.870
I'm after the truth.

01:19:51.930 --> 01:19:54.000
The truth is that
sometimes the department
doesn't protect your family

01:19:54.070 --> 01:19:57.370
after you've spent
your whole life protecting
everybody else's.

01:20:11.120 --> 01:20:14.660
I call Detective William Learner

01:20:14.720 --> 01:20:16.460
of the Internal Affairs Bureau

01:20:16.530 --> 01:20:18.660
to state the charges
and specifications

01:20:18.730 --> 01:20:21.300
against Detective
Michael Thornton.

01:20:22.930 --> 01:20:25.500
I must inform the board
at this time

01:20:25.570 --> 01:20:29.140
the parties of the Internal
Affairs Bureau concerned
with allegations of misconduct

01:20:29.210 --> 01:20:32.970
against Detectives
Michael Thornton
and Thomas Moran

01:20:34.580 --> 01:20:37.880
wish to withdraw departmental
and criminal charges.

01:20:41.220 --> 01:20:43.390
Was this a self-initiated case?

01:20:44.020 --> 01:20:47.120
I apologized to the board
for misleading you.

01:20:47.190 --> 01:20:48.390
I acted hastily.

01:20:48.990 --> 01:20:52.630
To pursue these charges
would be a disregard
for the facts.

01:20:53.700 --> 01:20:55.330
And what are the facts?

01:20:56.200 --> 01:21:00.040
My suspicion was based
on a now proven false allegation

01:21:00.100 --> 01:21:03.870
and supported by an unfortunate
string of coincidences.

01:21:04.710 --> 01:21:08.740
I request that even my filing
on these charges

01:21:08.810 --> 01:21:10.350
be expunged from the record

01:21:11.080 --> 01:21:14.350
so to not blemish these
detectives' untarnished records.

01:21:17.120 --> 01:21:18.150
Um...

01:21:18.850 --> 01:21:21.390
Effective immediately,
your suspension is rescinded.

01:21:21.460 --> 01:21:23.630
You may resume your assignment.

01:21:46.150 --> 01:21:47.980
Yeah, club soda with lime.

01:21:48.050 --> 01:21:51.490
Well, club soda.
I'll take yours then.
You won't be needing this.

01:21:52.390 --> 01:21:53.860
- A toast.
- Cheers.

01:21:53.920 --> 01:21:56.960
- To Chayo getting nine.
- <i>Salud.</i>

01:21:57.030 --> 01:21:58.490
- Yes, yes, yes.
- We got it, we got it.

01:21:58.560 --> 01:21:59.790
- Hear, hear.
- Long time coming.

01:21:59.860 --> 01:22:01.330
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

01:22:01.400 --> 01:22:03.000
- Yeah.
- We got them.

01:22:03.070 --> 01:22:04.070
<i>Salud.</i>

01:22:24.020 --> 01:22:26.960
I was just passing by the bar
to see how you were doing.

01:22:28.020 --> 01:22:29.060
Yeah, I'm good.

01:22:30.390 --> 01:22:31.630
Hey, where's your guy?

01:22:33.130 --> 01:22:35.200
Believe it or not,
he transferred out

01:22:35.260 --> 01:22:37.570
and into narcotics in Brooklyn.

01:22:39.800 --> 01:22:41.440
Well, I did not see that coming.

01:22:41.500 --> 01:22:43.570
No, me either.
He's a Boy Scout,

01:22:43.640 --> 01:22:45.070
but, you know,
he'll be all right.

01:22:46.240 --> 01:22:47.740
Is that Vietnam?

01:22:49.440 --> 01:22:51.150
Oh, yeah. Yeah, two tours.

01:22:51.910 --> 01:22:54.580
You know, war's like
surviving a tornado.

01:22:54.650 --> 01:22:58.120
Well, you know that.
Moran knew that.

01:22:58.190 --> 01:22:59.690
Once the storm is over,

01:22:59.750 --> 01:23:02.890
you don't even remember
how you survived it. Hmm.

01:23:04.990 --> 01:23:07.330
It's never really over, is it?

01:23:07.400 --> 01:23:08.560
No.

01:23:09.560 --> 01:23:10.800
One thing's for sure.

01:23:11.370 --> 01:23:13.670
You don't come out
the same way you went in.

01:23:15.240 --> 01:23:17.910
See, you were born 20 years
too late for the job.

01:23:19.280 --> 01:23:22.080
They don't want guys
like you and Moran anymore.

01:23:23.180 --> 01:23:26.450
A long time ago, long before
they even invented light bulbs,

01:23:26.510 --> 01:23:29.050
some smart-ass
named Machiavelli,

01:23:29.120 --> 01:23:31.820
I think he said, um,
"It's better to be loved than--"

01:23:31.890 --> 01:23:34.960
No, "it's better to be
feared than loved."

01:23:36.190 --> 01:23:39.060
I mean, what's that say
about us, huh?

01:23:39.130 --> 01:23:41.230
That we're a bunch
of fucking animals?

01:23:41.300 --> 01:23:42.230
Mm.

01:23:42.860 --> 01:23:45.030
But we're also the zookeepers.

01:23:46.770 --> 01:23:48.070
Is that love?

01:24:36.550 --> 01:24:37.950
Is that your dad's
baseball mitt?

01:24:38.020 --> 01:24:40.060
It's not a mitt, it's a glove.

01:24:40.860 --> 01:24:42.220
I stand corrected.

01:24:44.890 --> 01:24:47.400
Spoken like the son
of a real baseball player.
