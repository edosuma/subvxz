00:12.880 --> 00:16.590
Oh, my gosh!
Dad, look at this place!

00:16.620 --> 00:19.510
Lockers instead of coffins,

00:19.530 --> 00:22.680
classrooms instead of cages.

00:23.940 --> 00:26.690
Him instead of...

00:26.720 --> 00:27.700
What was I talking about?

00:31.490 --> 00:34.440
Dad, does she have to go to my high school?

00:34.480 --> 00:36.310
Seriously, she's creepy.

00:37.570 --> 00:40.130
It's not Chyna's fault she's a monster.

00:40.170 --> 00:42.380
It's your mom's fault.

00:42.410 --> 00:45.310
When I met her, I thought
she was wearing a costume.

00:45.350 --> 00:49.070
I didn't know she was a monster
till after we were married.

00:49.110 --> 00:51.120
Which actually happens to a lot of guys.

00:53.440 --> 00:56.940
Well, I don't want Chyna anywhere
near me with her disgusting...

00:59.290 --> 01:02.130
Chyna, how many times have I told you

01:02.170 --> 01:04.090
not to turn your brother to stone?

01:20.830 --> 01:22.880
Hi, I'm Gibson.
Hi.

01:22.920 --> 01:26.800
Welcome to the Mutant Farm!

01:26.830 --> 01:28.790
I love doing that.

02:27.690 --> 02:30.650
So, all these kids are monsters?

02:30.690 --> 02:34.580
Yes. Like you, each student in
the Mutant Program is a freak.

02:35.960 --> 02:37.610
Alex is a skeleton.

02:41.670 --> 02:45.460
He should stop exercising.
He's down to 0% body fat.

02:47.990 --> 02:50.350
Angus is a zombie.

02:50.380 --> 02:53.240
Do I have guidance counselor
stuck in my teeth?

02:55.280 --> 02:57.970
And then there's Svetlana.

02:58.000 --> 02:59.170
Where is Svetlana?

03:04.060 --> 03:07.490
That's it. You're grounded.
Give me your broom.

03:11.480 --> 03:14.890
Ugh! How is that
punishing him?

03:19.180 --> 03:21.970
Uh, I don't mean to alarm anyone,

03:22.000 --> 03:24.030
but that kid has a dead body.

03:24.070 --> 03:26.680
Oh, that's Fletcher.
He collects dead bodies.

03:29.130 --> 03:31.960
Is this your coffin?
It's beautiful.

03:32.330 --> 03:33.320
You're beautiful.

03:35.020 --> 03:38.020
I mean, your coffin is beautiful.

03:38.050 --> 03:40.320
I don't have a coffin.
I sleep in a snake pit.

03:42.050 --> 03:44.310
I know, but, you see, I...

03:50.940 --> 03:54.240
Hi. I'm Olive Doyle,
mad scientist.

03:54.270 --> 03:57.270
You know, I could get
you one of these hats.

03:57.300 --> 03:59.030
Why would I want to hide my brain?

03:59.070 --> 04:00.930
Brains!

04:02.070 --> 04:03.930
Do they come in pink?

04:03.960 --> 04:07.060
You can go right over there, bud.

04:07.090 --> 04:10.960
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm
working on an evil formula.

04:10.990 --> 04:12.890
What's in it?

04:12.920 --> 04:14.890
Methyl glucose ether, sodium
hydroxide, tartaric acid,

04:14.920 --> 04:17.890
sulfate copolymer, polyquaternium
10, and high-fructose corn syrup.

04:18.250 --> 04:20.930
That stuff's in everything.

04:20.959 --> 04:24.130
Now, this will turn that skunk into a hunk.

04:37.110 --> 04:39.880
A hunk of what?
That's Gibson.

04:39.920 --> 04:42.250
Oh, thank goodness I'm not a skunk anymore.

04:43.990 --> 04:45.050
Ugh!
Ugh!

04:45.090 --> 04:48.290
Man, what's that smell?
Oh, I just farted.

05:03.200 --> 05:06.210
Halloween dance?

05:06.240 --> 05:09.980
I don't understand why we have to
celebrate this stupid holiday.

05:10.010 --> 05:13.080
I mean, it's Halloween
every day around here.

05:13.110 --> 05:16.150
Speaking of which, how much
time do we have before...

05:18.850 --> 05:19.990
Run!

05:23.130 --> 05:25.060
Brains!

05:27.200 --> 05:29.100
Brains!

05:33.940 --> 05:35.300
This arm looks a little dry.

05:36.270 --> 05:39.010
Does anyone have any ranch dressing?

05:40.240 --> 05:42.110
Or moisturizer?

05:46.950 --> 05:48.220
What's with the evil laugh?

05:48.250 --> 05:51.020
Evil laugh?
That's my regular laugh.

05:51.050 --> 05:53.950
This is my evil laugh.

05:53.990 --> 05:55.060
Tee-hee-hee!

06:07.070 --> 06:09.240
Oh, look, they're serving Sloppy Joe.

06:10.210 --> 06:11.940
Hey, Joe.

06:12.180 --> 06:13.980
Help!

06:14.010 --> 06:16.180
I'll be there as fast as I can!

06:20.250 --> 06:23.820
Angus ate the entire basketball team!

06:23.850 --> 06:26.060
Well, I couldn't eat the track team.

06:26.090 --> 06:27.290
They're too hard to catch.

06:29.060 --> 06:30.960
You have to do something about this.

06:30.990 --> 06:32.190
Angus ate my prom date.

06:33.130 --> 06:34.860
And my boyfriend.

06:35.270 --> 06:36.970
And the guy I like.

06:40.170 --> 06:44.840
Oh, come on.
There's no reason we can't be friends.

06:44.880 --> 06:47.980
You'd like us if you got to know us.

06:48.010 --> 06:51.910
Maybe this revolting
creature is on to something.

06:51.950 --> 06:53.220
We'll have a buddy system.

06:53.250 --> 06:55.320
Every mutant will be
paired with a non-mutant.

06:55.350 --> 06:58.990
You guys can work together to
prepare for the Halloween dance.

06:59.020 --> 07:00.150
What?

07:01.020 --> 07:02.090
What?

07:02.920 --> 07:04.960
That is a great idea!

07:04.990 --> 07:08.090
We can choose our buddies by
drawing names out of my hat.

07:08.830 --> 07:10.160
No!

07:11.070 --> 07:12.270
No!

07:14.870 --> 07:16.270
I'll just pair you up right now.

07:16.300 --> 07:19.110
Chyna, you're with Lexi.
Olive, you're with Paisley.

07:19.140 --> 07:21.630
Fletcher, you're with Cameron.
And you...

07:22.670 --> 07:24.280
Well, you're good.

07:34.160 --> 07:36.290
Look at these offensive decorations.

07:36.330 --> 07:39.000
I mean, spider webs?

07:39.030 --> 07:42.200
Just because we're monsters doesn't
mean we don't keep a tidy home.

07:44.300 --> 07:46.270
Look at the size of this orange!

07:48.040 --> 07:51.070
It's hard to peel.

07:51.110 --> 07:54.080
You know, I could hook you up to a
machine that could make you smarter.

07:54.480 --> 07:56.080
Okay.

07:56.110 --> 07:57.380
It might melt your insides.

07:58.180 --> 07:59.180
Okay.

08:03.350 --> 08:05.990
I'll make you smarter
by switching your brain

08:06.020 --> 08:08.360
with one from a far more intelligent being.

08:13.160 --> 08:15.300
Do you really think this will...

08:21.070 --> 08:24.010
Okay, we're in charge
of games for the dance.

08:24.040 --> 08:26.380
I was thinking bobbing for eyeballs?

08:26.410 --> 08:28.450
Musical electric chairs?

08:28.480 --> 08:30.250
Truth or death?

08:31.450 --> 08:35.049
Don't look at me!
I don't want to turn to stone!

08:35.090 --> 08:37.390
I'd instantly gain like 2,000 pounds.

08:39.030 --> 08:42.330
Okay, well, how about hide and shriek?

08:46.430 --> 08:49.130
Okay, you win.
Let's play again.

08:53.470 --> 08:57.110
So, let's talk refreshments.
What should we serve at the dance?

08:57.440 --> 08:59.180
How about

09:00.150 --> 09:01.150
garlic?

09:05.420 --> 09:07.180
That's just a myth.

09:07.220 --> 09:09.150
Vampires aren't afraid of garlic.

09:09.190 --> 09:10.420
In fact, we love it.

09:10.460 --> 09:12.960
Sauteed over blood sausage?

09:12.990 --> 09:14.090
To die for.

09:16.030 --> 09:19.030
Okay, in that case, why don't we serve

09:20.130 --> 09:21.130
stake?

09:24.000 --> 09:25.340
That doesn't work either.

09:25.370 --> 09:27.240
If you want to damage
my heart with a stake,

09:27.270 --> 09:29.110
make it a fatty porterhouse.

09:30.340 --> 09:32.080
All right.

09:32.110 --> 09:34.350
How about for drinks we serve

09:36.080 --> 09:37.250
holy water?

09:42.260 --> 09:43.460
Seriously, dude.

09:49.430 --> 09:51.060
Hey, Angus!

09:51.100 --> 09:52.430
How are you and your buddy
doing with ticket sales?

09:52.470 --> 09:54.070
Good.

09:55.140 --> 09:57.170
Where is your buddy?

09:58.270 --> 10:01.070
He's not feeling well.

10:01.110 --> 10:04.080
Angus, did you eat your buddy?

10:05.380 --> 10:07.350
Not all of him.

10:07.380 --> 10:10.250
There's some left
over in this tinfoil swan.

10:17.360 --> 10:21.230
Wow.
The gym looks great!

10:21.260 --> 10:23.360
And see?
Nobody got hurt.

10:23.400 --> 10:25.500
That's true.
Good point.

10:25.530 --> 10:27.230
I feel fine.

10:29.240 --> 10:31.140
And we all did it together.

10:31.170 --> 10:35.540
Lexi suggested instead of
eyeballs, we bob for apples.

10:38.150 --> 10:40.410
And I've got to say apples
are just not as sweet.

10:43.080 --> 10:46.450
You know, maybe we'll actually
have fun at this party.

10:46.490 --> 10:48.220
I can't wait to hit the dance floor.

10:48.250 --> 10:50.120
I'm going to do the Frankenstein!

10:54.460 --> 10:57.460
Oh, no, don't do that.
It's culturally insensitive.

10:57.500 --> 11:00.430
Not all monsters dance like that.

11:00.470 --> 11:04.170
Besides, you're not going to the dance.
It's monsters only.

11:04.210 --> 11:07.040
What?
Why can't they come?

11:07.080 --> 11:09.440
Sorry.
It's Mutant Council policy.

11:09.480 --> 11:11.410
"No humans are allowed
to the Halloween dance,

11:11.450 --> 11:13.350
"unless already in
Angus' stomach."

11:15.080 --> 11:17.080
Who wants to be my plus one?

11:19.150 --> 11:21.450
That's not fair.
We did all that work.

11:21.490 --> 11:23.120
Yeah.

11:23.160 --> 11:25.220
This really ruffles my feathers.

11:36.070 --> 11:38.100
Hey, Dad.

11:38.140 --> 11:40.510
I see you finally had your growth spurt.

11:42.340 --> 11:44.340
It's a Halloween costume.

11:44.380 --> 11:46.240
Halloween's stupid.

11:46.280 --> 11:47.410
Like candy corn.

11:47.450 --> 11:50.210
Doesn't look like corn!
Doesn't taste like corn!

11:50.250 --> 11:52.550
You can't pop it in the microwave!
I tried!

11:55.190 --> 11:57.150
Hey, where are you going dressed like that?

11:57.190 --> 11:59.090
Trick or treating.

11:59.120 --> 12:01.520
Since Chyna and the other mutants
won't let us go to the dance.

12:01.560 --> 12:04.530
No way. It's not safe for
you to be out on Halloween.

12:04.560 --> 12:08.000
That's not fair.
You let Chyna go out.

12:08.030 --> 12:09.430
You let her do anything she wants.

12:09.470 --> 12:11.300
Because I'm scared of her.

12:11.340 --> 12:13.240
She's got snakes for hair, man!

12:28.390 --> 12:31.320
Hey. Sorry I'm late.
I had to stop at the bank.

12:36.060 --> 12:39.230
Oh, look!
I just got a text from Satan.

12:39.260 --> 12:41.330
"See you soon."

12:41.360 --> 12:44.270
We're going bowling on Saturday.

12:44.300 --> 12:49.100
What? Satan and I are supposed
to go rollerblading on Saturday.

12:49.140 --> 12:51.310
Aw! You cannot
trust that guy!

12:57.250 --> 13:00.220
You know, I still feel bad
for the regular kids.

13:00.250 --> 13:02.190
They really wanted to be here.

13:02.220 --> 13:06.190
Boo-hoo.
Poor beautiful, undeformed humans.

13:06.220 --> 13:08.160
Just think about how they must feel,

13:08.190 --> 13:10.230
being scared in their own school.

13:10.260 --> 13:12.300
If only we could walk a
mile in their shoes.

13:12.330 --> 13:15.470
What? That's crazy.
Walk a mile?

13:15.500 --> 13:18.030
No one can walk a mile.

13:19.270 --> 13:21.340
Would you stop worrying
about the normal kids?

13:21.370 --> 13:24.310
Come on. Just relax
and have some punch.

13:24.340 --> 13:25.470
There's eye of newt in it.

13:28.210 --> 13:30.280
Sorry, Newt.

13:30.420 --> 13:32.250
How can I get through to them?

13:36.350 --> 13:39.020
The punch!

13:39.050 --> 13:41.050
This should give the punch a kick.

14:03.010 --> 14:04.980
Ooh, trick or treaters.

14:05.010 --> 14:06.110
Help yourself to some candy.

14:12.320 --> 14:16.150
Cameron, it's us.
Lexi and Paisley.

14:16.190 --> 14:18.390
Paisley? Did Olive
switch you back?

14:18.420 --> 14:23.290
Yeah. I didn't want to,
but the duck insisted.

14:23.330 --> 14:26.230
Ooh! Good,
you're in costume.

14:26.270 --> 14:29.230
A bunch of us humans are going
to sneak into the dance

14:29.270 --> 14:31.170
dressed as mutants.

14:32.310 --> 14:35.070
Hey!
What's going on here?

14:35.110 --> 14:36.980
You're not going out, are you?

14:37.010 --> 14:40.250
No, these are friends from school,

14:40.280 --> 14:42.120
here to watch a horror movie

14:42.150 --> 14:44.050
and it's more fun when you dress up.

14:44.080 --> 14:45.950
If we're going to watch a movie,

14:45.990 --> 14:47.150
can you cut me bigger eye holes?

14:49.390 --> 14:51.360
Well, a movie sounds fun!

14:51.390 --> 14:53.360
I'll join you!
Let me get my costume!

14:56.200 --> 14:58.430
Great.
Now we're stuck here.

14:58.460 --> 15:00.200
Not necessarily.

15:02.200 --> 15:06.170
These sculptures are so realistic!
They look just like us!

15:11.110 --> 15:13.210
Now let's go get our party on!

15:21.220 --> 15:22.920
Check out this policeman costume I bought

15:22.960 --> 15:24.990
with money I made at my policeman job.

15:27.330 --> 15:30.030
All right, kids!
Let's watch that movie!

15:32.230 --> 15:33.230
Vroom! Vroom!

15:46.310 --> 15:49.150
Okay, everyone act natural.

15:50.120 --> 15:52.050
I mean, unnatural.

15:54.020 --> 15:57.960
The bride of Frankenstein, huh?

15:57.990 --> 16:00.160
Hey, Frank, mind if I dance with your wife?

16:07.330 --> 16:09.400
Hey, baby.
What's your blood type?

16:11.200 --> 16:13.170
Oh.
I'm not positive.

16:13.210 --> 16:16.040
Dang. I'm so in the
mood for O positive!

16:17.240 --> 16:19.180
Okay, everybody, gather round.

16:22.050 --> 16:24.050
I would like to propose a toast.

16:25.220 --> 16:27.190
To life!

16:28.190 --> 16:29.260
And death.

16:34.100 --> 16:36.060
Wow. Good stuff.

16:44.210 --> 16:45.310
What's happening to me?

16:49.280 --> 16:50.380
I'm beautiful!

16:53.280 --> 16:56.150
I have a reflection!

16:56.180 --> 17:00.120
I used your lab to whip up a formula
that makes monsters look human.

17:00.150 --> 17:02.390
And we all just drank it.

17:04.220 --> 17:05.930
This way you can see for yourself

17:05.960 --> 17:08.160
that it's not so easy to be human.

17:08.200 --> 17:09.960
How come they didn't change?

17:10.970 --> 17:12.329
They're drinking the punch.

17:12.369 --> 17:14.300
Uh, no we're not.

17:16.339 --> 17:17.369
Cameron?

17:20.339 --> 17:22.280
You guys crashed our dance?

17:22.310 --> 17:25.310
I will now feast on your blood!
Tee-hee-hee!

17:27.280 --> 17:28.349
You don't have fangs.

17:29.420 --> 17:33.120
But you do have some baby teeth.

17:33.160 --> 17:38.330
Look, there's no reason monsters
and humans can't get along.

17:38.360 --> 17:40.290
Can't you see we're all
the same underneath?

17:40.330 --> 17:44.000
Oh, a jack-o-lantern!
Let's light it!

17:44.030 --> 17:45.970
Fire bad!

17:57.050 --> 17:59.210
Great.
The DJ left!

17:59.250 --> 18:02.180
This party's dead and so am I.

18:02.220 --> 18:05.350
Well, at least I was
before you turned me into

18:05.390 --> 18:07.060
a human.

18:08.290 --> 18:10.230
Yeah.
Let's go, you guys.

18:11.960 --> 18:13.130
Hey, wait!

18:14.970 --> 18:18.000
If you guys want music,
I can perform something.

18:18.030 --> 18:21.300
What are you going to do?
Play some creepy organ?

18:21.340 --> 18:25.310
There are organs?
I didn't see any at the snack table!

18:25.340 --> 18:29.110
Hey! Don't take that.
Not the spleen! Not the spleen!

18:31.980 --> 18:35.020
Actually, Lexi, I was thinking
I could sing a little.

20:32.100 --> 20:34.070
Oh, okay, it was just you guys.

20:43.280 --> 20:44.420
Oh, no.

20:44.450 --> 20:46.150
It's the cops!

20:46.190 --> 20:48.290
We'll never outrun that motorcycle!

20:51.120 --> 20:53.320
Have there been complaints
about too much noise?

20:53.360 --> 20:57.060
No. But there have been
complaints about too much candy.

20:58.100 --> 21:00.460
I'm going to have to confiscate this.

21:32.330 --> 21:34.000
He went in the basement.

21:40.210 --> 21:43.380
See? Nothing good ever
happens in the basement.

21:48.050 --> 21:50.250
Wow. You guys are
not easily scared.

21:55.810 --> 21:57.940
Wow, Cameron.
