00:03.804 --> 00:04.535
(MUSIC PLAYING)

00:09.310 --> 00:12.213
Hey guys, thanks for
helping me set up for my
Mixed Martial Arts party

00:12.213 --> 00:13.943
even though you both
don't want to come.

00:13.943 --> 00:15.516
It's not that
I don't want to come,

00:15.516 --> 00:17.418
it's just...
I'm very shy.

00:17.418 --> 00:19.290
I get
uncomfortable at parties.

00:19.290 --> 00:21.092
Especially ones
watching a sport
I dislike

00:21.092 --> 00:23.124
with people
I can't stand
eating food I hate.

00:23.124 --> 00:24.455
I'm very shy.

00:26.397 --> 00:29.160
But Barry,
you said, we had
"better things to do."

00:30.331 --> 00:31.902
I mean, I'm shy too.

00:34.065 --> 00:36.067
Hey, Cyd, you ready to
go to the craft fair?

00:36.067 --> 00:38.309
The craft fair
is tomorrow night.
My party's tonight.

00:38.309 --> 00:39.740
No, your party
is tomorrow night.

00:39.740 --> 00:41.412
The craft fair
is tonight.

00:41.412 --> 00:42.713
How did we
mix this up?

00:42.713 --> 00:44.475
I put it in
the calendar
on your phone.

00:44.475 --> 00:46.077
I deleted the calendar

00:46.077 --> 00:48.079
'cause it kept
telling me what to do
and when to do it.

00:49.220 --> 00:51.051
But how'd you
forget about my party?

00:51.051 --> 00:52.183
I wrote it
on your hand.

00:52.183 --> 00:53.384
I wash my hands.

00:53.384 --> 00:56.687
So that's where
the problem happened.

00:56.687 --> 00:59.760
This is a disaster.
How are we both gonna
go to each other's things?

00:59.760 --> 01:03.364
What's the big deal?
Can't you each just
go to your own events?

01:03.364 --> 01:06.066
This is the first time
I'm selling my jewelry
at a craft fair.

01:06.066 --> 01:08.139
I want my best friend
with me for support.

01:08.139 --> 01:10.271
And this is the first party
I've ever thrown.

01:10.271 --> 01:12.743
I want my best friend
with me for support.

01:12.743 --> 01:15.476
And to tell the cops
everything is cool when
the party gets outta hand.

01:15.476 --> 01:17.348
I do not have a
trustworthy face.

01:19.580 --> 01:21.081
Plus, everything
Cyd and I do

01:21.081 --> 01:23.314
is so much better
when we do it together.

01:23.314 --> 01:25.486
I even made us
"Better Together"
necklaces.

01:25.486 --> 01:27.658
BOTH: Better together!

01:27.658 --> 01:29.320
It's cool 'cause
we said it together.

01:29.320 --> 01:31.021
Are you sure about that?

01:31.021 --> 01:34.295
Hey, it is cool!

01:34.295 --> 01:37.498
What are we going to do?
It's not like we can go to
two things on the same night.

01:37.498 --> 01:40.831
Guys, I think the
answer to your problem
is obvious.

01:40.831 --> 01:41.832
Think about it.

01:42.533 --> 01:45.035
Right!
We can time travel!

01:45.035 --> 01:46.637
We can do my thing,
then jump back in time

01:46.637 --> 01:48.879
and go to your thing.
Thanks, Naldo.

01:48.879 --> 01:50.441
Oh, I wasn't gonna
say time travel.

01:50.441 --> 01:52.583
I was gonna say use
Rock, Paper, Scissors
like we do.

01:54.845 --> 01:59.089
Yes! I never lose
since I invented
my rock-cutting scissors.

01:59.089 --> 02:01.222
I know there's no such thing
as rock-cutting scissors,

02:01.222 --> 02:03.324
but Barry really
needs a win sometimes.

Renaldo, we've been

to replicate
time travel without success.

03:03.654 --> 03:05.216
Remember when I told you

03:05.216 --> 03:06.517
we're not nearly
desperate enough

03:06.517 --> 03:08.158
to start
reassigning inputs randomly

03:08.158 --> 03:09.620
like a couple of idiots?
Yes.

03:09.620 --> 03:11.362
We are now
desperate enough

03:11.362 --> 03:13.364
to start reassigning

03:17.127 --> 03:19.199
We are not invited,
but we are here!

03:21.201 --> 03:23.334
We just finished our game
and now we're bored.

03:23.334 --> 03:26.677
I wanted to stay at the park
and whack stuff with a bat.

03:26.677 --> 03:29.580
But I wanted to come here
to see what science stuff
is going on

03:29.580 --> 03:31.181
and whack that
with a bat.

03:31.181 --> 03:32.283
No! Not my laser!

Why are you
calling me Bret?
I'm Chet.

03:42.393 --> 03:44.625
And why are you
calling me Chet?
I'm Bret.

03:44.625 --> 03:46.927
I'm sorry, guys,
I always get
you two mixed up.

03:46.927 --> 03:48.629
No, you didn't.

03:48.629 --> 03:50.461
I think the laser
made them switch bodies.

03:54.034 --> 03:55.406
Well...

03:56.267 --> 03:57.538

freckles are gone!

04:13.684 --> 04:15.085
It does matter.

04:15.085 --> 04:16.757
They're not who
they're supposed to be.

04:16.757 --> 04:18.529
Bret is Chet,
and Chet is Bret.

04:18.529 --> 04:19.990
This is a nightmare!

04:19.990 --> 04:21.362
I am not doing
this to be difficult.

04:21.362 --> 04:23.364
I just don't see
the problem.

04:24.795 --> 04:26.967
We have to tell Mom.
She'll fix this.

04:26.967 --> 04:28.439
Wait, wait,
don't tell your mom.

04:28.439 --> 04:30.941
Barry, if anyone finds out,
we're gonna be
in huge trouble.

04:30.941 --> 04:33.504
Why? Switching
their bodies, it's like...

04:33.504 --> 04:35.476
It's like
ordering a Cobb salad

04:35.476 --> 04:37.308
and the waitress
accidentally brings you

04:37.308 --> 04:39.850
someone else's
identical Cobb salad.

04:39.850 --> 04:41.452
It doesn't matter!

04:42.553 --> 04:44.014
But if anyone finds out,

04:44.014 --> 04:46.056
they could make us
stop doing science
in the RV.

04:46.056 --> 04:47.588
Okay, that matters.

04:47.588 --> 04:50.521
Um, I'll just make
some adjustments
to the laser

04:50.521 --> 04:51.862
and we'll
zap them again.

04:51.862 --> 04:53.364
And I'm sure it will
switch them right back.

but you know
how every time
you get excited,

05:24.625 --> 05:26.126
you punch me
in the arm?
Yeah!

05:27.428 --> 05:29.099
Sorry, Shelby,
were you saying something?

05:29.099 --> 05:30.160
You want me to switch
places with you?

05:30.160 --> 05:32.302
I can take a punch.
Name's Drake.

05:32.302 --> 05:33.464
Oh, I get it.

05:33.464 --> 05:35.105
Just because
I'm a woman,

05:35.105 --> 05:36.637
I can't take a punch?
Ah!

05:37.468 --> 05:38.539
Okay, let's switch.

Ah!

Hey, you're not Shelby.

Uh, Drake,
this is Cyd.
Cyd, Drake.

Nice jab
you got there.

05:47.618 --> 05:49.119
Sorry, did that hurt?

I can take a punch.

Hit me
in the chest.
Ah!

05:56.587 --> 05:58.829
Nothing.
Punch me
in the gut.

Ah!
Ow! (COUGHS)

06:00.791 --> 06:02.493
Just kidding.
Nothing.

are fake!

they're coasters.

who'd love these?

07:37.287 --> 07:39.289
Not my parents,
they think
I'm wasting my life.

07:39.289 --> 07:40.761
When I left

my mom told me to,

07:40.761 --> 07:42.733
"Have fun
wasting your life!"

That's messed up, right?

What's your name?

07:50.400 --> 07:51.471
Joaquin.

Coasters that
look like food?

07:52.843 --> 07:55.676
That is so clever,
fellow professional.

07:57.508 --> 07:59.079
I made them myself.

Oh, I love them.
I... I mean
I like them.

08:00.781 --> 08:04.054

08:10.220 --> 08:12.763
Wow, you're holding me close,
but not too close,

08:12.763 --> 08:14.795
I like your breath,
it smells like noodles.

08:14.795 --> 08:19.199
Shelby, you're doing that
ramble-y thing you do
when you think a guy's cute.

08:19.199 --> 08:23.033
He's insecure, neurotic,
and self-deprecating.

08:23.033 --> 08:24.304
I like him so much!

08:25.275 --> 08:26.837
You do?
I do!

08:26.837 --> 08:28.108
(BOTH SQUEALING)

08:28.108 --> 08:29.740
This is just like
a Y.A. novel

08:29.740 --> 08:31.542
where we both
find boys
at the same time!

08:31.542 --> 08:32.743
What would
it be called?

08:32.743 --> 08:34.585
Who cares?
We both found boys
at the same time!

08:40.721 --> 08:42.852
So when I activate
these rocket sleds,

08:42.852 --> 08:44.825
you will be
hurled into each other,

08:44.825 --> 08:46.997
much like
atoms in a
particle accelerator.

08:46.997 --> 08:50.661
The resulting collision
should slam you back
into your correct bodies.

08:50.661 --> 08:52.633
Ready? Three,

08:52.633 --> 08:54.635
two...
BOTH: Wait!

08:54.635 --> 08:56.607
Are you sure
this is safe?

08:56.607 --> 08:58.368
I have concerns!

09:00.510 --> 09:03.443
Very well.
I will prove to you
that it's perfectly safe.

09:03.914 --> 09:06.376
Three, two, one!

09:06.376 --> 09:07.377
(BEEPS)

09:10.681 --> 09:12.683
All right.
We'll do it.

09:14.725 --> 09:17.187
We'll think of
something else.

09:17.187 --> 09:19.890

Bret! Chet! Dinner!

09:19.890 --> 09:20.891
This is bad, Barry.

09:20.891 --> 09:22.532
Their mom will
definitely be able to tell

09:22.532 --> 09:24.534
there's something
wrong with them.

09:24.534 --> 09:26.867
We better go with them
to dinner and help
keep a lid on this.

09:26.867 --> 09:29.740
Barry, Norm's at work,
so you can take his seat.

09:29.740 --> 09:31.271
And the girls
are at the craft fair,

09:31.271 --> 09:33.573
so Naldo can sit
at Shelby's place.

09:33.573 --> 09:37.147
So, looks like
everybody's sitting in
someone else's seat tonight.

09:37.147 --> 09:39.179
Get it?
Renaldo, what
are you doing?

09:39.179 --> 09:41.451
Do you not understand
the meaning of
"keep a lid on it"?

09:41.451 --> 09:43.553
No, I don't.
It's not a
common phrase.

09:45.716 --> 09:46.857
Ew!

09:46.857 --> 09:49.219
But Chet, you love
mashed potatoes.

09:49.219 --> 09:50.590
I'll take his.

09:50.590 --> 09:52.422
But Bret, you hate
mashed potatoes.

09:52.422 --> 09:54.895
Yeah, you hate
mashed potatoes.
(TAP)

09:54.895 --> 09:55.766
Ow!

09:55.766 --> 09:57.698
Don't kick my body!

09:59.099 --> 10:01.632
You boys are
acting very strange.

10:01.632 --> 10:03.433
She's onto us.

10:03.433 --> 10:04.735
Mrs. M,

10:04.735 --> 10:06.476
you do so much
around here.

10:06.476 --> 10:07.778
We'll keep an eye
on Chet and Bret

10:07.778 --> 10:09.139
and do the dishes.

10:09.139 --> 10:11.882
Go, have some Astrid time.
You deserve it.

10:11.882 --> 10:13.814
Part of me thinks
you're up to something,

10:13.814 --> 10:15.615
but the rest of me
is goin' to the movies.

10:15.615 --> 10:17.447
Don't forget
to pre-rinse.

10:17.447 --> 10:20.520
There's a French New Wave
festival at the Art House.

10:20.520 --> 10:23.323
That's weird.
Chet's the
pretentious film snob.

10:23.323 --> 10:24.795
Quick, say
something pretentious.

10:24.795 --> 10:25.996
Something pretentious.

10:25.996 --> 10:27.357
(SPEAKING FRENCH)

10:31.932 --> 10:34.865
I can't believe
we both met boys
we like at the same time!

10:34.865 --> 10:37.167
Joaquin is so
sweet and creative,

10:37.167 --> 10:39.239
and we have
the best conversations.

10:39.239 --> 10:41.111
Well, he mostly
makes fun of himself
and I ramble,

10:41.111 --> 10:42.512
but we make it work.

10:43.774 --> 10:45.716
And I love how
Drake can take a punch!

10:45.716 --> 10:48.148
Other guys
would be like
"Ow, stop it,"

10:48.148 --> 10:51.882
but not my Drake
Whatever-his-last-name-is.

10:51.882 --> 10:55.025
Hi, Shelby.
You like my shirt?
It's probably dumb.

10:55.025 --> 10:56.326
I love it,
I wanna marry it.

10:56.326 --> 10:57.828
I mean, why would
I wanna marry it?

10:57.828 --> 10:59.559
You can't marry a shirt,
at least not in the
state of Oregon,

10:59.559 --> 11:00.731
I mean, hi.

11:01.692 --> 11:03.493
I'll leave you two alone.

11:04.564 --> 11:06.566
What's up,
Soft Palms?

11:06.566 --> 11:07.868
Whoa, whoa,
who told you about that?

11:07.868 --> 11:09.239
That's my weakness.

11:10.300 --> 11:11.471
I know.

11:11.471 --> 11:13.403
That and big brown eyes.

11:15.075 --> 11:16.977
What is wrong with you?

11:18.648 --> 11:21.611
What do you mean?
We did this at my MMA party...

11:21.611 --> 11:23.754
Which I canceled
in this timeline

11:23.754 --> 11:25.115
to go to the
craft fair with Shelby

11:25.115 --> 11:27.187
so we never met.

11:27.187 --> 11:28.759
That doesn't
make any sense.

11:29.860 --> 11:30.861
(SNICKERING)

11:33.093 --> 11:34.624
Drake doesn't know
who I am.

11:34.624 --> 11:36.967
One second, Cyd.
Let me just finish
what I was saying.

11:36.967 --> 11:38.298
(GIGGLING)

11:38.298 --> 11:41.501
What do you mean Drake
doesn't know who you are?

11:41.501 --> 11:44.134
We erased that timeline
when we jumped back
to do your craft fair.

11:44.134 --> 11:45.976
I never met him
at the MMA party.

11:45.976 --> 11:47.978
Well,
let's just go back
and do it again.

11:47.978 --> 11:49.079
But then you
won't meet Joaquin.

11:49.079 --> 11:51.681
The timeline we do last
is the one we continue in.

11:51.681 --> 11:53.744
The other one disappears
like it never happened.

11:53.744 --> 11:56.787
Unless, we jump back
in time and split up.

11:56.787 --> 11:58.448
Then we can each
get to meet our guys!

11:58.448 --> 11:59.950
You're right.
We wanted to
do this together,

11:59.950 --> 12:01.191
but this seems
like the only way.

12:06.897 --> 12:08.558
Where did you
run off to?

12:08.558 --> 12:10.400
What are you talking about?
I came here to fix the laser.

12:10.400 --> 12:12.432
And left me to do
the dishes by myself!

12:12.432 --> 12:14.064
You're the one
who offered to
do the dishes!

12:14.064 --> 12:15.866
Why are we fighting?

12:15.866 --> 12:17.067
I don't know.

12:17.067 --> 12:18.939
It's just the kids
have me so stressed out.

12:21.171 --> 12:22.572
Me, too.

12:22.572 --> 12:24.775
Look what we've
done to the Marcus's.

12:24.775 --> 12:26.746
We body swapped the twins,

12:26.746 --> 12:29.279
we turned their daughter
into a time traveler,

12:29.279 --> 12:32.282
we use their hot tub
without permission...

12:32.282 --> 12:33.483
A lot.

12:35.826 --> 12:36.827
Barry, look!

12:41.691 --> 12:42.833
Bret...
Huh?

12:42.833 --> 12:44.394
...or Chet.
I don't know.

12:45.695 --> 12:48.598
Was I sleepwalking?
Aw, man.

12:48.598 --> 12:52.042
Mom usually tucks me
in super tight at night
so I stay in bed.

12:52.042 --> 12:53.904
So your body is
tucked into bed right now
with Bret inside of it?

12:53.904 --> 12:57.047
Yes, but Bret drinks
a lot of water before bed,

12:57.047 --> 12:58.508
so right about now
he has to pee.

12:58.508 --> 13:00.150
CHET: Help!
I'm tucked in too tight

13:00.150 --> 13:02.012
and I have to...

13:02.012 --> 13:03.013
Never mind!

13:04.684 --> 13:07.918
My Great Directors
of German Expressionism
sheets!

13:07.918 --> 13:09.589
I'm coming, Fritz Lang!

13:13.693 --> 13:15.595
Hey, Joaquin!

13:15.595 --> 13:16.726
How do you
know my name?

13:16.726 --> 13:18.798
Oh, right.
This isn't how we met.

13:18.798 --> 13:22.102
I should just ramble
and you can tell me
how dumb your shirt is.

13:22.102 --> 13:23.603
That was
not very nice.

13:24.504 --> 13:25.735
(CHUCKLES)

13:25.735 --> 13:27.237
(CHEERING ON TV)

13:27.237 --> 13:29.309
Excuse me,
I need this seat.

13:29.309 --> 13:30.680
Can we switch?

13:30.680 --> 13:32.983
Oh. Well, I got here early
and put my cushion down.

13:32.983 --> 13:34.144
So, this is my seat.

13:35.545 --> 13:37.347
Uh, you don't understand.

13:37.347 --> 13:39.819
I have to meet
that cute guy
next to you.

13:39.819 --> 13:42.592
Oh, there's
a cute guy
next to me?

13:42.592 --> 13:45.455
Oh, I see what
you're working with.

13:48.098 --> 13:49.960
But this is
my party.

13:49.960 --> 13:51.962
This was supposed
to be my seat!

13:51.962 --> 13:52.933
Oh!

13:52.933 --> 13:55.105
Hey!
You're supposed to like this!

13:56.736 --> 13:57.968
Let's get away
from her.

14:00.310 --> 14:03.243
It shouldn't be
happening like this!

14:03.243 --> 14:06.146
This was different
when Shelby was here!

14:06.146 --> 14:07.277
And Cyd called me over
and I said,

14:07.277 --> 14:08.879
"Coasters that
look like food?
So clever."

14:08.879 --> 14:10.050
And you said,
"I made them myself."

14:10.050 --> 14:10.981
And then you took my
"Together" necklace

14:10.981 --> 14:11.982
and you pulled me close.
Take the necklace!

14:11.982 --> 14:12.983
Take the necklace!

14:14.254 --> 14:16.186
Finally, you're here!
She's freaking me out!

14:18.058 --> 14:20.090
You called security on me?

14:20.090 --> 14:21.791
Oh, no.

14:21.791 --> 14:23.463
If I'm having
this much trouble
without Cyd...

14:23.463 --> 14:26.796
Maybe Shelby's having
the same problem
without me.

14:26.796 --> 14:27.837
BOTH: I've gotta go.

14:29.139 --> 14:30.500
Hey, have you seen Shelby?

14:30.500 --> 14:32.342
Sorry,
I don't know Shelby.

14:32.342 --> 14:34.204
Hey, you want to
buy a coaster
that looks like food?

14:34.204 --> 14:36.446
No thanks.
Well, how about
I give you one?

14:36.446 --> 14:37.877
'Cause no one's
buying them anyway.

14:40.050 --> 14:41.481
These are
actually pretty cool.

14:41.481 --> 14:43.153
Thanks.
I love making them

14:43.153 --> 14:44.884
but, I don't know...
I mean, maybe
my parents are right.

14:44.884 --> 14:46.656
Maybe I am
wasting my time.
(SCOFFS)

14:46.656 --> 14:49.559
Well, my parents
aren't even here.
They're in Peru.

14:49.559 --> 14:51.922
How'd you swing that?
I'd love to send
my parents to Peru.

14:51.922 --> 14:53.623
(BOTH LAUGH)

14:53.623 --> 14:55.525
I'm Joaquin.
I'm Cyd.

14:58.328 --> 15:01.071
The thing about the
frozen vegetable medley

15:01.071 --> 15:03.133
is that every bite
is a surprise.

15:03.133 --> 15:05.135
You got peas,
carrots, and corn.

15:05.135 --> 15:06.676
Uh, carrots,
corn, peas.

15:06.676 --> 15:09.179
Corn, peas,
green beans.
You just never know, right?

15:09.179 --> 15:10.180
(BOTH LAUGHING)

15:11.741 --> 15:14.144
Excuse me,
have you seen Cyd?

15:14.144 --> 15:15.946
I'm sorry,
this is really important.

15:15.946 --> 15:17.847
I have to talk to her.

15:17.847 --> 15:21.451
Well, I was only talking
to you to make
my boyfriend jealous, anyway.

15:21.451 --> 15:24.024
You brought this
on yourself, Anthony.

15:24.024 --> 15:25.155
You made me
do this!

15:29.399 --> 15:31.661
Huh! Wicked cool
of you to rescue me.

15:31.661 --> 15:34.364
These MMA parties bring
out all kinds of nutjobs.

15:34.364 --> 15:37.237
I have to admit,
I'm not
that into MMA.

15:37.237 --> 15:38.438
It's actually
my friend who likes it.

15:38.438 --> 15:41.111
It's a little
over-the-top for me.

15:41.111 --> 15:43.013
Well, it kinda has to be.

15:43.013 --> 15:44.474
These guys
aren't going in
all big and tough

15:44.474 --> 15:46.116
because they know
they're going to win.

15:46.116 --> 15:49.049
They're doing it
because they're afraid
they might lose.

15:49.049 --> 15:50.720
I never thought
of it like that.

15:52.022 --> 15:54.024
Sometimes
I go big,

15:54.024 --> 15:55.885
and maybe
it's 'cause I'm scared
things might not work out

15:55.885 --> 15:56.987
the way
I want them to.

15:57.527 --> 16:00.060
I get that.

16:00.060 --> 16:02.332
I'm sure I'm probably
coming off a little strong
at this party,

16:02.332 --> 16:05.135
but it's 'cause
I don't really
know anybody here.

16:06.296 --> 16:07.537
Well, you're not
doing that with me.

16:08.898 --> 16:11.271
Yeah, I'm not.

16:11.271 --> 16:13.073
(CHUCKLES) I guess you're just
really easy to talk to.

16:14.374 --> 16:15.975
You are, too.

16:17.007 --> 16:18.678
(BOTH LAUGHING)

16:18.678 --> 16:20.080
I can't believe
your favorite food
is nachos.

16:20.080 --> 16:22.012
I can't believe
I haven't punched you once.

16:23.853 --> 16:25.415
I didn't realize
that was a thing
you might do.

16:25.415 --> 16:28.188
Should I be worried?

16:28.188 --> 16:29.959
CYD: We've been talking
 for two hours.

16:29.959 --> 16:32.192
I really like this guy.

16:32.192 --> 16:33.393
Dang it!
 What am I saying?

16:33.393 --> 16:35.495
This is Shelby's guy!

16:35.495 --> 16:37.227
SHELBY: Wait, what am I doing?

16:37.227 --> 16:39.269
This is Cyd's guy!

16:39.269 --> 16:41.031
BOTH: I am the worst friend!

16:47.137 --> 16:50.210
SHELBY: Man,
 Drake and I
 really connected.

16:50.210 --> 16:51.681
It wasn't like with Joaquin.

16:51.681 --> 16:53.583
This is so much deeper.

16:53.583 --> 16:55.045
But Drake is Cyd's guy!

16:55.045 --> 16:56.216
I feel so guilty.

16:57.887 --> 16:59.919
Just play it cool, Shelby.

17:00.320 --> 17:02.352
Hey, Cyd.

17:02.352 --> 17:04.894
"Hey, Cyd"?
 Could I be
 any more obvious?

17:06.226 --> 17:07.327
Hey, Shelby.

17:07.327 --> 17:09.699
Could I be
 any more obvious?

17:11.701 --> 17:14.164
I can't believe
 I like Shelby's guy.

17:14.164 --> 17:17.537
But Joaquin and I
 really talked,
 not like with Drake.

17:17.537 --> 17:19.539
That was
 just punchin' arms.

17:19.539 --> 17:22.442
Joaquin and I
 punched each other
 with our hearts.

17:24.314 --> 17:26.316
So I went to look for
you at the MMA party.

17:26.316 --> 17:29.279
I thought you might
need my help with Drake,
but you weren't there.

17:29.279 --> 17:30.520
Because I went
to the craft fair

17:30.520 --> 17:32.952
thinking you needed my help
with Joaquin!

17:32.952 --> 17:34.984
Shelbs, we were
thinking the same thing!

17:34.984 --> 17:36.126
BOTH: Aw!

17:37.257 --> 17:39.028
BOTH: I'm living a lie!

17:41.131 --> 17:43.032
CYD: I'll just text him
 and end it.

17:43.032 --> 17:45.395
SHELBY: I'll just tell him
 I can't do this.

17:45.395 --> 17:47.567
(CELL PHONE CHIMES)
(DRAKE'S VOICE)
 I got this for you.

17:47.567 --> 17:49.269

Yeah, mine too.

18:04.053 --> 18:06.686
Wow,
8:30 already?
Should we go to bed?

18:06.686 --> 18:07.687
Great idea!

18:13.363 --> 18:15.595
You've got to take
care of me, Chet.

18:15.595 --> 18:17.927
You haven't
showered once
in my body!

18:17.927 --> 18:19.229
I don't want to touch it!

18:19.229 --> 18:20.670
It's gross!

18:22.402 --> 18:24.404
Go take a shower!

18:24.404 --> 18:26.306
Ow!
You shocked me!

18:27.837 --> 18:29.979
(STATIC BUZZ))
Ow!
You shocked me back!

18:31.981 --> 18:33.613
I'm charging up, Bret!

18:33.613 --> 18:35.185
Bring it on, Chet!

18:43.923 --> 18:45.355
Are you
back in you, Bret?

18:45.355 --> 18:47.627
Yes. Are you
back in you, Chet?

18:47.627 --> 18:49.259
Let me check.

18:49.259 --> 18:50.260
'Sup.

18:50.260 --> 18:51.601
I'm back!

18:53.102 --> 18:54.133
Morning, boys.

18:55.765 --> 18:57.807
Oh. Are you two
here for breakfast?

18:57.807 --> 18:59.469
Do your parents
feed you?

18:59.469 --> 19:00.840
Do you need me to make a call?

19:02.272 --> 19:04.274
No, Mrs. Marcus.
Something happened

19:04.274 --> 19:05.775
and we were
trying to fix it,
but we can't.

19:05.775 --> 19:07.447
So it's time for
us to come clean.

19:07.447 --> 19:09.078
Barry, I'm Bret!

19:09.078 --> 19:10.820
I know and
I feel terrible
about it.

19:12.121 --> 19:15.154
You see Mrs. Marcus,
he's Bret and he's Chet

19:15.154 --> 19:16.486
and it's
all our fault.

19:16.486 --> 19:18.328
I think I had
something to do with it.

19:20.029 --> 19:22.692
I don't care if it means
we can't do science
in the RV anymore.

19:22.692 --> 19:24.734
Bret and Chet
are more important.

19:24.734 --> 19:26.536
See, they may seem identical,

19:26.536 --> 19:29.839
but they are unique
and special individuals...

19:31.040 --> 19:32.372
So good job
raising them.

19:34.404 --> 19:36.206
Barry, what are
you talking about?

19:36.206 --> 19:39.409
Gratitude is not
just for Mother's Day.
Run, Renaldo.

19:42.051 --> 19:43.753
How Kafkaesk.

19:43.753 --> 19:46.716
Oh, man,
your pretentiousness
stayed in my body!

19:47.917 --> 19:48.918
Enjoy it.

19:53.122 --> 19:54.964
I hope
 I don't run into Drake.

19:54.964 --> 19:57.096
It's going to be
 so awkward.

19:57.096 --> 19:59.399
I didn't text
 Joaquin back all night.

19:59.399 --> 20:01.831
He probably hates me.

20:01.831 --> 20:04.374
Oh, look, there's Joaquin.

20:04.374 --> 20:06.906
The guy I like.
Oh, and there's Drake.

20:06.906 --> 20:08.378
The guy I like.

20:08.378 --> 20:10.380
Well, I guess
we should go talk to 'em.

20:10.380 --> 20:13.082
Yup.
The guys we like.

20:17.387 --> 20:18.618
(BOTH TALKING AT ONCE)

20:24.294 --> 20:26.596
BOTH: We're perfect
for each other
and I'm so sorry!

20:28.598 --> 20:31.230
I can't believe
we didn't talk to
each other about this.

20:31.230 --> 20:34.133
We always
talk to each other
about everything.

20:34.133 --> 20:36.135
We let boys
come between us.

20:36.135 --> 20:38.037
We can't do that.

20:38.037 --> 20:41.271
Nothing is more important
than our friendship.

20:41.271 --> 20:44.173
I hated keeping a secret
from my best friend.

20:44.173 --> 20:46.946
We can't be afraid
to tell each other
the truth.

20:46.946 --> 20:48.448
You can tell me anything,

20:48.448 --> 20:50.750
even if you think
it's gonna hurt my feelings,
I can take it.

20:50.750 --> 20:52.081
Me too.
No you can't.

20:52.081 --> 20:53.753
Hey! Oh, you were
telling the truth.

20:53.753 --> 20:54.754
Totally takin' it.

20:56.756 --> 20:58.488
So, have we
messed things up

20:58.488 --> 21:00.860
with the boys
by not texting them back
all night?

21:00.860 --> 21:03.092
Most likely.
How do we fix it?

21:03.893 --> 21:05.164
Together.

21:05.164 --> 21:06.296
(BOTH TALKING AT ONCE)

21:13.743 --> 21:14.974
BOTH: Huh?

21:16.175 --> 21:18.107
BOTH: She really likes you.

21:18.107 --> 21:19.779
BOTH: She likes me!
 She likes me!

21:19.779 --> 21:20.950
BOTH: She likes me!

21:22.111 --> 21:23.313
BOTH: Cool.

21:27.787 --> 21:29.088
So.

21:29.088 --> 21:30.520
Joaquin, is it?

21:32.522 --> 21:33.723
That's correct, sir.

21:33.723 --> 21:35.024
Where do you see this
coaster thing going?

21:35.024 --> 21:36.426
Is that a full time job?

21:36.426 --> 21:37.397
You think you can
support a family on that?

21:40.229 --> 21:41.931
So Drake, tell me.

21:41.931 --> 21:44.073
How do you feel about
salt and vinegar chips?

21:44.073 --> 21:45.605
Eh, not a fan.

21:45.605 --> 21:46.806
I don't like
these guys, Barry.

21:46.806 --> 21:48.307
They're not good enough
for our girls.

21:50.079 --> 21:52.181
Barry, Naldo,
what are you doing?

21:52.181 --> 21:54.484
You guys do not have to
answer their questions.

21:54.484 --> 21:56.486
Yeah. Let's get out of here.

21:56.486 --> 21:57.617
Be home by 8:00!

21:57.617 --> 21:58.848
They grow up so fast.
