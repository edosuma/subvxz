01:03.931 --> 01:06.700
You are the winner of

Icesis Couture,
shantay you stay.

01:11.371 --> 01:14.675
Ocane, sashay away.

01:21.248 --> 01:23.850
Ocane is sent home.

01:23.850 --> 01:26.320
All of a sudden
it just, like, hits me.

01:26.320 --> 01:28.789
I'm gutted that Ocane
won't be here.

01:28.789 --> 01:30.524
Oh, my God.

01:30.524 --> 01:33.627
Ocane, I love you so much,
it's so sad.

01:33.627 --> 01:36.430
But what is this novel?

01:36.430 --> 01:37.431
A whole book.

01:37.431 --> 01:40.634
This bitch
wrote a whole book.

01:40.634 --> 01:41.635
Trilogy.

01:41.635 --> 01:45.872
"Thanks for this amazing time
with you girls.

01:45.872 --> 01:47.407
Love you, Icesis."

01:49.076 --> 01:50.844
[cries] Okay.

01:50.844 --> 01:53.313
Girl, you were
one of my only friends

01:53.313 --> 01:55.248
outside of this competition,

01:55.248 --> 01:58.051
and I am going to miss you.

01:58.051 --> 02:00.787
Ocane brought such a light,

02:00.787 --> 02:03.557
but I needed to stay
and she had to go,

02:03.557 --> 02:05.492
so the show must go on.

02:05.492 --> 02:07.594
I kicked her fucking ass,
though.

02:07.594 --> 02:08.795
[all laugh]

02:08.795 --> 02:12.632
I'm really happy that the judges
gave me a second chance.

02:12.632 --> 02:13.934
I'm not gonna fuck up again,

02:13.934 --> 02:16.103
because this just means
too much to me.

02:16.103 --> 02:19.239
It's fucking scary up there.

02:19.239 --> 02:21.575
To go from, like, being
the winner to the bottom

02:21.575 --> 02:23.744
is such a far drop.

02:23.744 --> 02:25.545
-But we love you.
-And you put on a fucking show.

02:25.545 --> 02:26.546
And you killed it.

02:26.546 --> 02:30.250
Icesis went from top to bottom
in one week.

02:30.250 --> 02:32.686
She is versatile.

02:32.686 --> 02:35.522
Apparently, no one is safe.

02:35.522 --> 02:39.226
Congratulations to you,
Miss Pythia. Uh-huh.

02:39.226 --> 02:42.362
Yes.
[applause]

02:42.362 --> 02:44.965
How does it feel to win?

02:44.965 --> 02:45.999
It feels amazing,

02:45.999 --> 02:47.968
because after not winning
the design challenge,

02:47.968 --> 02:50.971
which is what I do,
I was a little bitter.

02:50.971 --> 02:53.774
I work in circus
and film and theater

02:53.774 --> 02:55.609
as a designer
and a makeup artist,

02:55.609 --> 02:59.379
and I was like, I need to excel
in my element, and I did it.

02:59.379 --> 03:00.580
Honestly, well deserved.

03:00.580 --> 03:01.815
Yeah, well deserved.

03:01.815 --> 03:04.017
This is, like,
one of the most iconic looks.

03:04.017 --> 03:04.951
-Thank you.
-Seriously.

03:04.951 --> 03:06.520
And you're gonna
give people nightmares

03:06.520 --> 03:08.321
with that performance.

03:08.321 --> 03:09.990
One step closer to the crown.

03:09.990 --> 03:10.991
[laughs]

03:10.991 --> 03:13.393
So my Ontario sister Eve,

03:13.393 --> 03:15.362
this is your second time
in the bottom.

03:15.362 --> 03:17.998
-Uh-huh.
-How are you feeing?

03:17.998 --> 03:18.965
With Ocane going home,

03:18.965 --> 03:21.101
it makes me feel like
I don't deserve to be here.

03:21.101 --> 03:22.702
-Oh!
-No, no, no.

03:24.604 --> 03:25.772
I'm sorry.

03:25.772 --> 03:28.475
I've always wanted
to be positive,

03:28.475 --> 03:29.643
but it's really hard,

03:29.643 --> 03:34.147
because... [cries]

03:34.147 --> 03:36.683
I'm so closed off
with my emotions,

03:36.683 --> 03:40.754
and I'm a lot more sensitive
than I allow people to see.

03:40.754 --> 03:43.290
I'm so sorry, Kendall, for...

03:43.290 --> 03:45.292
No, you were in your feelings.

03:45.292 --> 03:46.560
I don't take it personally.

03:46.560 --> 03:47.494
We all say shit.

03:47.494 --> 03:48.628
Let's just move on

03:48.628 --> 03:50.530
and just, like, believe
and trust in yourself.

03:50.530 --> 03:52.899
Trust me, I ain't mad, girl.

03:52.899 --> 03:57.404
She needs to realize that we all
are here to support her.

03:57.404 --> 03:59.139
No one is out to get her.

03:59.139 --> 04:02.642
But there's
an inner saboteur in there

04:02.642 --> 04:04.811
that needs to be put to bed.

04:04.811 --> 04:06.513
We're here,
and bitches are being--

04:06.513 --> 04:08.181
Pew, pew, pew.

04:08.181 --> 04:10.817
Slicked off the island, girls.

04:10.817 --> 04:16.389
Strap in, honey, because
this is a wild roller coaster.

04:16.389 --> 04:18.825
I went from the bottom
to the top.

04:18.825 --> 04:20.894
Icesis went from the top

04:20.894 --> 04:23.063

to cuddle up close
to a nice slab of man meat

06:06.900 --> 06:09.803
than watching a good,
old-fashioned horror flick.

For this week's maxi-challenge,

06:12.672 --> 06:15.141
you will each unleash
your inner scream queen,

06:15.141 --> 06:17.711
as you overact
in a slasher film

06:17.711 --> 06:20.280
that we're calling Screech.

06:20.280 --> 06:22.849
[screaming]

06:22.849 --> 06:24.784
This is iconic.

06:24.784 --> 06:27.454
Screech tells the story
of a gaggle of drag sisters

06:27.454 --> 06:30.223
competing for the title
of drag superstar.

06:30.223 --> 06:31.858
-Oh.
-Sound familiar?

06:31.858 --> 06:32.792
Yeah.

06:32.792 --> 06:34.995
But the competition
takes a killer turn

06:34.995 --> 06:37.831
when the queens start
death-dropping, or, rather...

06:37.831 --> 06:38.898
dropping dead.

07:25.712 --> 07:27.380
She was able to show us

07:27.380 --> 07:30.283
that Black people don't
just listen to rap and hip-hop.

07:30.283 --> 07:33.286
We not only originated
rock and roll,

07:33.286 --> 07:34.788
but we're still here, baby.

07:48.335 --> 07:50.870
Okay, so what do we all think?

07:50.870 --> 07:52.472
-It's so good.
-It's so funny.

07:52.472 --> 07:54.374
There's a lot of lines.

07:54.374 --> 07:57.377
So the premise
is there is a killer

07:57.377 --> 08:00.246
killing drag queens.
Child.

08:00.246 --> 08:03.149
I'll begin by reading out
all the character descriptions.

08:03.149 --> 08:04.284
"Hooking Hytes:

08:04.284 --> 08:08.054
"cold-hearted and bitchy version
of Brooke Lynn Hytes.

08:08.054 --> 08:10.123
"Blood and Goreski:

08:10.123 --> 08:13.727
a creepy and devilish version
of Brad Goreski. [laughs]

08:13.727 --> 08:15.295
Speaks very ominously."

08:15.295 --> 08:16.796
-What's "ominously?"
-"A-Martha:

08:16.796 --> 08:18.298
"A stern Martha

08:18.298 --> 08:20.166
"who's determined to use
her position as a judge

08:20.166 --> 08:21.901
to guide the queens to safety."

08:21.901 --> 08:26.005
Overacting in a drag horror
movie
is gonna be quite fun.

08:26.005 --> 08:28.641
There's gonna be
a lot of layers of stereotypes

08:28.641 --> 08:30.143
that we're gonna play with.

08:30.143 --> 08:31.311
I've already decided
what role I want.

08:31.311 --> 08:33.580
I think it's pretty obvious
from the description

08:33.580 --> 08:35.115
I'm gonna be Nara Hater.

08:35.115 --> 08:37.083
The fun thing about Nara Hater

08:37.083 --> 08:39.285
is that she's always
turning to the camera.

08:39.285 --> 08:40.487
If you wanna be a scene stealer,

08:40.487 --> 08:43.423
there's no better way than
to make everyone else freeze

08:43.423 --> 08:44.924
as you turn to the camera

08:44.924 --> 08:47.460
and tell everybody
exactly what's happening.

08:47.460 --> 08:50.597
I would really love
the role of Nara Hater.

08:50.597 --> 08:52.065
My first choice--

08:52.065 --> 08:53.767
It's already highlighted.

08:53.767 --> 08:56.069
Don't try it, little girl,
because this is my role.

08:56.069 --> 08:57.837
I think I really
understand the humor,

08:57.837 --> 08:59.939
and also, she says
"body-ody-ody,"

08:59.939 --> 09:02.242
and I think I'm the only one
who really can do that.

09:02.242 --> 09:03.576
Aah!

09:03.576 --> 09:06.746
I would like to play
Jocklyn Straps.

09:06.746 --> 09:08.481
Yeah, I see it.
I so see it.

09:08.481 --> 09:13.720
She's this dumb,
hetero, typical jock.

09:13.720 --> 09:15.121
I thought about Jocklyn Straps

09:15.121 --> 09:17.624
because it's such a contrast
to my character.

09:17.624 --> 09:19.259
I kind of thought
I could, like, butch it up

09:19.259 --> 09:20.393
because it would be
so hilarious.

09:20.393 --> 09:21.995
I'm sorry, Synthia,

09:21.995 --> 09:23.730
but you're gonna have
to fight me for this role.

09:23.730 --> 09:24.831
So then we're gonna settle it

09:24.831 --> 09:26.433
with some rock, paper, scissors,
guys. I'm sorry.

09:26.433 --> 09:28.334
Rock, paper, scissors.

09:28.334 --> 09:31.237
Oh, bitch, okay!

09:31.237 --> 09:33.306
Fuck! [laughs]

09:33.306 --> 09:35.375
Fuck, fuck,
fuck, fuck, fuck!

09:35.375 --> 09:36.476
I have a question.

09:36.476 --> 09:39.979
What does "cont'd," C-O-N-T-D--

09:39.979 --> 09:41.080
"Continued."

09:41.080 --> 09:43.283
Yeah, you don't read
that part, it's just--

09:43.283 --> 09:45.685
Don't be calling nobody
no cont'd around here.

09:45.685 --> 09:48.855
I really wanted Nara Hater,

09:48.855 --> 09:51.324
but as I'm reading the script,

09:51.324 --> 09:53.760
this bitch has, like,
fucking 50 lines,

09:53.760 --> 09:55.728
and they're long.

09:55.728 --> 09:58.698
I love a long one,
but not lines.

09:58.698 --> 10:00.266
I'm gonna take a step back.

10:00.266 --> 10:01.267
Okay.

10:01.267 --> 10:03.670
Because I'm not really good
at memorizing lines,

10:03.670 --> 10:05.538
so I'm gonna take Clitney.

10:05.538 --> 10:06.906
Eve, I think
you should be Nara.

10:06.906 --> 10:07.807
I agree.

10:07.807 --> 10:09.209
I think you're
very confident in that,

10:09.209 --> 10:10.743
and I think it's gonna
be really good for you.

10:10.743 --> 10:13.279
Me having the role
of the casting agent,

10:13.279 --> 10:16.783
I want everyone to shine
in their own way.

10:16.783 --> 10:18.852
We have Suki as Emmy Dumpa,

10:18.852 --> 10:21.688
sex-obsessed horndog drag queen.

10:21.688 --> 10:23.590
I'm feeling so confident.

10:23.590 --> 10:28.628
Sex? It's oozing from
all the orifices over my body.

10:28.628 --> 10:29.729
We have Kendall
as Hooking Hytes,

10:29.729 --> 10:32.565
Adriana as Blood and Goreski,

10:32.565 --> 10:33.766
Synthia as A-Martha,

10:33.766 --> 10:35.101
me as Fairuzah Cock,

10:35.101 --> 10:37.470
drag queen who is
a spooky, kooky witch.

10:37.470 --> 10:40.240
No matter what, someone may be
unhappy and someone may not,

10:40.240 --> 10:42.408
but that's the name of the game.

10:42.408 --> 10:44.777
Okay, girls, let's get to work.

10:44.777 --> 10:46.980
[cheering]

10:46.980 --> 10:51.384
We've got lines to memorize,
we have itty-bitty time.

10:51.384 --> 10:53.453
So I'm Blue Scarymore,

10:53.453 --> 10:56.489
a stereotypical
Valley Girl drag queen.

10:56.489 --> 10:58.458
I'm Clitney Lescott,

10:58.458 --> 11:02.595
drag queen who is anxious
and suspicious of everything.

11:02.595 --> 11:04.264
It's not far from who I am,

11:04.264 --> 11:05.865
because I'm definitely
so anxious

11:05.865 --> 11:07.800
and very suspicious
all the time,

11:07.800 --> 11:11.037
because there's fucking ghosts
everywhere around me.

11:11.037 --> 11:13.840
I get sleep paralysis,
and I see them.

11:13.840 --> 11:14.974
I'm not crazy, I swear it.

11:14.974 --> 11:16.142
I barely have any lines,

11:16.142 --> 11:17.744
so I really
have to sell my character.

11:17.744 --> 11:21.548
So I've been thinking of,
like, super overreacting it.

11:21.548 --> 11:23.016
What Drag Race has taught me

11:23.016 --> 11:25.985
is you don't have to be
a professional actor

11:25.985 --> 11:27.754
to win an acting challenge.

11:27.754 --> 11:31.958
My plan of attack:
go big or go home.

11:31.958 --> 11:35.295
We're kind of doing
impersonations
to an extent, right?

11:35.295 --> 11:36.629
Of our beloved judges.

11:36.629 --> 11:39.299
It's like them
turned into a cartoon.

11:39.299 --> 11:41.000
I think with Brooke Lynn,

11:41.000 --> 11:42.201
it's a lot about the, like,

11:42.201 --> 11:44.804
sort of tiny nuances
of her, like, face.

11:44.804 --> 11:46.072
She does a lot of, like...

11:46.072 --> 11:50.143
I have a little bit of
a smaller, more nuanced role,

11:50.143 --> 11:52.545
so I'm excited to kind of
reel it in a little bit.

11:52.545 --> 11:55.148
Now, in this week's
act of resistance...

11:55.148 --> 11:57.483
Through the fates
of rock, paper, scissors,

11:57.483 --> 12:00.253
I am blessed with the role
of A-Martha.

12:00.253 --> 12:04.557
It's a great part of the script,
but it didn't resonate with me,

12:04.557 --> 12:05.725
and that is always a flag,

12:05.725 --> 12:08.328
because those lines
aren't gonna come naturally.

12:08.328 --> 12:10.830
I'm a little bit of
a Stressica Simpson right now.

12:10.830 --> 12:14.033
It says that I have to be
kind of "om-i-ness."

12:14.033 --> 12:15.034
-Ominous?
-Ominous?

12:15.034 --> 12:16.669
I thought that was an
interesting prompt,

12:16.669 --> 12:19.672
because Brad is quite, like,
sprightly in his demeanor.

12:19.672 --> 12:23.343
I am playing a creepy
and devilish version

12:23.343 --> 12:25.211
of our judge Brad.

12:25.211 --> 12:26.579
Trying to do, like, both,

12:26.579 --> 12:29.315
so go like this a little,
and then go, ooh.

12:29.315 --> 12:30.350
That makes--

12:30.350 --> 12:31.684
Yeah, campy, campy, campy.

12:31.684 --> 12:34.921
I did theater in school,
and I loved it.

12:34.921 --> 12:36.723
It's my passion.

12:36.723 --> 12:39.092
I need to kill this role.

12:39.092 --> 12:42.328
Brad is a real person,
and he's gonna be judging me.

12:42.328 --> 12:47.533
I'm gonna try and tone down
the sass that I usually have.

12:47.533 --> 12:51.037
So I am Frontelle Lobe,
the nerd.

12:51.037 --> 12:52.171
It's outta my wheelbarrow.

12:52.171 --> 12:54.040
Normally I am Black and sassy.

12:54.040 --> 12:56.743
One thing I do love
is to have different characters,

12:56.743 --> 12:58.678
especially when you're on stage.

12:58.678 --> 12:59.612
In the pageant world,

12:59.612 --> 13:02.782
when you have a talent,
you have to become that talent.

13:02.782 --> 13:04.250
So you have to emote.

13:04.250 --> 13:07.153
So if it's one thing
if I can do, it's emote.

13:07.153 --> 13:08.321
Aah!

13:08.321 --> 13:10.223
Oh, bro.

13:10.223 --> 13:13.092
Oh, fuck, man. Oh, no!

13:13.092 --> 13:15.194
Aah! Woo-woo-woo-woo-woo!

13:15.194 --> 13:17.764
Oh, shit! Oh, fuck! Oh!

13:17.764 --> 13:20.033
-Aah! Aah! Aah!
-Oh, I can do it, too.

13:20.033 --> 13:22.201
Uh-uh! [laughs]

13:22.201 --> 13:23.536
Shut up.

13:26.172 --> 13:28.408
Girls, what did you dress up as
for Halloween as children?

13:28.408 --> 13:31.611
To school, I was too nervous,
so I dressed up as a sailor.

13:31.611 --> 13:33.713
And then to go
trick or treating, bitch,

13:33.713 --> 13:36.015
she had her trench coat on,
and her black bob.

13:36.015 --> 13:38.251
-Love!
-And she was Victoria Beckham.

13:38.251 --> 13:40.687
That was actually the first time
I did drag, I think,

13:40.687 --> 13:42.021
in grade two.

13:42.021 --> 13:43.489
That is everything.

13:43.489 --> 13:44.891
There's actually not Halloween
in Greece,

13:44.891 --> 13:46.826
so I never got
to dress up as a child.

13:46.826 --> 13:48.628
So now I'm, like, well.

13:48.628 --> 13:50.229
She's doing it full time.

13:50.229 --> 13:52.865
Let's make it
a life choice.

13:52.865 --> 13:54.500
For me, Halloween is always
a little bit different,

13:54.500 --> 13:57.603
because October 31st
is actually my sobriety date.

13:57.603 --> 13:59.939
So we're coming up
onto six years.

13:59.939 --> 14:00.840
-Aah!
-Yeah!

14:00.840 --> 14:02.175
Congrats, baby!

14:02.175 --> 14:03.710
I bow out of Halloween

14:03.710 --> 14:06.045
because I don't like being
in the club if I can avoid it.

14:06.045 --> 14:07.547
If you don't mind me asking,

14:07.547 --> 14:11.084
what made you decide
to go sober?

14:11.084 --> 14:12.819
I was forced into the situation

14:12.819 --> 14:16.189
because my life had sort of,
like, fallen apart.

14:16.189 --> 14:19.959
I was about to lose my job,
I lost my apartment, my friends.

14:19.959 --> 14:22.995
Six years ago, I was a, uh...

14:22.995 --> 14:24.464
a drug addict.

14:24.464 --> 14:30.236
Drag sort of allowed me to
wear a mask in my bad behavior.

14:30.236 --> 14:31.838
Kendall was doing
the crazy shit.

14:31.838 --> 14:34.207
Ken was not.
Ken was chill.

14:34.207 --> 14:35.775
I think sometimes
that disconnect,

14:35.775 --> 14:38.010
it's hard to disassociate.

14:38.010 --> 14:41.681
It took my entire life
sort of falling apart

14:41.681 --> 14:44.016
for me to get out of that.

14:44.016 --> 14:46.619
What you see today here is not
who she was six years ago.

14:46.619 --> 14:48.154
She was rough.

14:48.154 --> 14:51.357
I was not a casual,
like, drug user.

14:51.357 --> 14:53.926
Drag in so many ways,
like, saved me.

14:53.926 --> 14:55.027
-Mm-hmm.
-Amen.

14:55.027 --> 14:59.198
It doesn't always happen
for people like this.

14:59.198 --> 15:00.800
The fact that I actually
get to, like,

15:00.800 --> 15:02.568
live my dreams
and, like, do this,

15:02.568 --> 15:03.636
and, like, literally look around

15:03.636 --> 15:06.005
and, like, I'm on
fucking Drag Race.

15:06.005 --> 15:07.874
-We love you.
-[laughs]

15:07.874 --> 15:11.110
This smoky eye's gonna run,
girl,
so I'm not gonna cry.

15:11.110 --> 15:12.178
[all laugh]

15:12.178 --> 15:13.146
I love you so much.

15:13.146 --> 15:14.046
Thank you, my love.

15:14.046 --> 15:15.381
I wanna hug you, but
I'm gonna start crying,

15:15.381 --> 15:17.316
and I wanna have one episode
where I don't cry.

15:17.316 --> 15:20.286
Yeah, we'll give you
one episode off.

15:20.286 --> 15:21.521
[laughs]

15:23.723 --> 15:26.492
[cheering]

15:26.492 --> 15:27.393
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo.

15:27.393 --> 15:28.528
Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

15:28.528 --> 15:32.098
Now it's time to shoot
the movie Screech.

15:32.098 --> 15:33.633
Hello, ladies.

15:33.633 --> 15:35.701
-Hi!
-Yo, wassup, wassup?

15:35.701 --> 15:37.737
Fefe, Amanda,
they're directing us.

15:37.737 --> 15:40.840
Woman power in the house. Ooh.

15:40.840 --> 15:41.774
Are y'all ready
for your closeups?

15:41.774 --> 15:43.509
Yes. Okay.

15:43.509 --> 15:44.777
We are going to kick off
your big-screen debut

15:44.777 --> 15:45.878
by shooting the first scene.

15:45.878 --> 15:46.979
Are you ready?

15:46.979 --> 15:48.414
-Yes!
-Yes!

15:48.414 --> 15:49.649
Lights, please.

15:50.917 --> 15:52.618
-Ooh!
-All right.

15:52.618 --> 15:53.619
And action.

15:53.619 --> 15:57.356
It's a new day in the werkroom,
and I'm feeling horny.

15:57.356 --> 15:59.659
Well, I'm feeling witchening.

15:59.659 --> 16:01.928
You're looking at
the next winner, baby.

16:01.928 --> 16:05.331
Cut. Pythia,
if you could enunciate.

16:05.331 --> 16:06.265
I love the breathiness,

16:06.265 --> 16:07.166
but I need to hear
what you're saying as well.

16:07.166 --> 16:08.568
The words? Yeah.

16:08.568 --> 16:11.070
-Action.
-Well, I'm--oh.

16:11.070 --> 16:13.406
Well, I'm feeling witchening.

16:13.406 --> 16:15.575
I just have
this horrible feeling

16:15.575 --> 16:19.145
like something bad
is gonna happen today!

16:19.145 --> 16:20.646
[wails]

16:20.646 --> 16:22.515
Well, whatever it is,

16:22.515 --> 16:25.084
I'm sure there's
an ointment for it.

16:25.084 --> 16:28.454
Stephanie, tone down a bit,
honey.

16:28.454 --> 16:30.289
I love the commitment.

16:30.289 --> 16:32.825
I need you to dial it back
a little bit.

16:32.825 --> 16:34.193
-Oh, me? Okay.
-Yes.

16:34.193 --> 16:35.895
Sometimes it's so gregarious

16:35.895 --> 16:38.831
that I'm not understanding
everyone else in the scene.

16:38.831 --> 16:44.270
I understand your note,
but I want all eyes on me.

16:44.270 --> 16:45.471
Action.

16:45.471 --> 16:49.408
Something bad
is gonna happen today.

16:49.408 --> 16:50.877
I'm sure there's
an ointment for it.

16:50.877 --> 16:54.280
Suki, love the sexuality.

16:54.280 --> 16:55.615
I say go hornier.

16:55.615 --> 16:56.749
-Hornier?
-Yeah.

16:56.749 --> 16:58.451
Ooh! I've been horny.

16:58.451 --> 17:01.854
Go horny or go home, baby.

17:01.854 --> 17:04.690
I'm sure there's
an ointment for it.

17:04.690 --> 17:05.691
Oh!

17:05.691 --> 17:07.894
[all laugh]

17:07.894 --> 17:09.629
-Hornier works, always.
-Hornier works.

17:09.629 --> 17:13.366
-Action.
-But there wasn't an ointment.

17:13.366 --> 17:14.834
There is no ointment

17:14.834 --> 17:17.470
for... murder.

17:17.470 --> 17:18.905
Be super dramatic when
you're looking into the camera,

17:18.905 --> 17:20.306
'cause that's your moment.

17:20.306 --> 17:22.241
Suck it up.

17:22.241 --> 17:26.078
There is no ointment for murder.

17:26.078 --> 17:28.648
I really felt
you have fun with it,

17:28.648 --> 17:30.216
which I don't think
I've ever seen you do

17:30.216 --> 17:32.184
in this competition yet
is see you have fun.

17:32.184 --> 17:33.886
[applause]
Oh, my God, I'm gonna cry now.

17:33.886 --> 17:37.256
I'm having so much fun
with this challenge.

17:37.256 --> 17:40.359
It is so fun to be
so crazy and over the top.

17:40.359 --> 17:44.063
What is it gonna do, kill me?
[laughs]

17:44.063 --> 17:46.365
Gia, when you say,
"What's it gonna do, kill me?"

17:46.365 --> 17:48.567
Like, that moment,
since we're foreshadowing,

17:48.567 --> 17:50.803
I think that could be
a real cool moment

17:50.803 --> 17:52.471
to, like, kind of
be over the top with it.

17:52.471 --> 17:54.273
May I ask a question about that?

17:54.273 --> 17:57.243
-Yeah, of course.
-I'm almost, like, traveling.

17:57.243 --> 18:00.112
Should I plant and then say it?

18:00.112 --> 18:02.448
Do I talk and have
a conversation with them?

18:02.448 --> 18:04.583
-The camera is your best friend.
-Okay.

18:04.583 --> 18:06.519
Fuck her.
[all laugh]

18:06.519 --> 18:07.553
Don't look back, man.

18:07.553 --> 18:09.989
And the camera is what
you wanna fuck, really, so--

18:09.989 --> 18:11.557
Oh.

18:11.557 --> 18:13.326
-Action.
-It's just a phone.

18:13.326 --> 18:16.729
What is it gonna do, kill me?
[laughs]

18:16.729 --> 18:18.564
[deep voice]
Who's a pretty little girl?

18:18.564 --> 18:20.533
[all scream]
None of you!

18:20.533 --> 18:22.468
-Aah!
-Was that RuPaul?

18:22.468 --> 18:25.137
Can you ask her
how much she benches?

18:25.137 --> 18:26.539
Oh!

18:26.539 --> 18:29.008
Cut. [laughs]
Icesis, bro,

18:29.008 --> 18:31.344
you remind me of everyone
I've ever dated.

18:31.344 --> 18:32.845
Gimme some, gimme some.

18:32.845 --> 18:35.681
Okay, so the cue will be
for the judges' entrance.

18:35.681 --> 18:37.049
Action.

18:38.784 --> 18:41.654
Bonjour, bonjour,
bonjour, bitches.

18:41.654 --> 18:43.856
Here I come.

18:43.856 --> 18:46.592
My daughters,
I can get you out of here.

18:46.592 --> 18:49.028
When I give
a deep, knowing glance,

18:49.028 --> 18:50.329
the time has come.

18:50.329 --> 18:53.799
Cut. Synthia, do you know
what you're saying

18:53.799 --> 18:56.235
by saying, "I'll send out
a deep, knowing glance?"

18:56.235 --> 18:57.703
Like, do you know
what that's based on?

18:57.703 --> 18:58.938
-The Handmaid's Tale?
-Yes.

18:58.938 --> 19:01.841
They have so many tales,
those handmaids.

19:01.841 --> 19:03.776
I will be watching
Handmaid's Tale

19:03.776 --> 19:05.144
the minute I get home.

19:05.144 --> 19:08.614
Character description
is quite stern and quite rigid.

19:08.614 --> 19:09.648
Just try to push that
a little more.

19:09.648 --> 19:10.649
Sternness.

19:10.649 --> 19:11.917
And watch the show next time.

19:11.917 --> 19:13.686
-Oh!
-[laughs]

19:13.686 --> 19:15.087
On it.
On it like a bonnet.

19:15.087 --> 19:16.322
They wear those, right?

19:16.322 --> 19:19.725
So let's pick it up.
Kendall, "Stop talking."

19:19.725 --> 19:21.360
Stop talking.

19:22.328 --> 19:25.598
My daughters,
I can help you escape here.

19:25.598 --> 19:28.367
When I give
a deep, knowing glance,

19:28.367 --> 19:29.468
the time has come.

19:29.468 --> 19:30.736
Cut.

19:30.736 --> 19:32.405
The line is "We leave tomorrow."

19:32.405 --> 19:33.773
We leave tomorrow.

19:33.773 --> 19:35.708
"I'll send out a deep, knowing
glance
when it's time."

19:35.708 --> 19:37.276
-Okay.
-Action.

19:37.276 --> 19:40.146
I can get you out of here.

19:40.146 --> 19:42.081
Oh, it's the cutoff.
I'm so sorry.

19:42.081 --> 19:45.284
This is why
I didn't want A-Martha.

19:45.284 --> 19:48.387
I wanted a role with less words.

19:48.387 --> 19:52.691
That is really why Jocklyn
Straps
was the perfect part.

19:52.691 --> 19:53.659
Fefe, just one more time,
the line.

19:53.659 --> 19:55.694
-We leave tomorrow.
-We leave tomorrow.

19:55.694 --> 19:57.496
I can see Synthia's in her head.

19:57.496 --> 20:00.132
Lalalalala. Okay.

20:00.132 --> 20:01.167
Get out of there, girl!

20:01.167 --> 20:03.102
Each of you will have the chance
to audition

20:03.102 --> 20:07.206
for the lead role in the
upcoming
production of Screech.

20:07.206 --> 20:10.810
Pause. Kendall, it was
a bit of paraphrasing.

20:10.810 --> 20:12.711
"In the new drag
slasher film Screech."

20:12.711 --> 20:16.982
Okay. I'm a very improv,
kind of adlib person,

20:16.982 --> 20:19.151
so sometimes I fill in the gaps

20:19.151 --> 20:21.520
in the way that my brain
thinks is good.

20:21.520 --> 20:24.056
We wanna see you scream, queen.

20:24.056 --> 20:27.226
"So let's hear you scream,
queens."

20:27.226 --> 20:28.260
So let's hear you scream,
queens.

20:28.260 --> 20:29.762
So let's hear you scream,
queens.

20:29.762 --> 20:30.663
What am I saying?

20:30.663 --> 20:31.730
We're gonna try this
one more time.

20:31.730 --> 20:34.066
We wanna hear you scream, queen.

20:34.066 --> 20:35.167
Aah!

20:35.167 --> 20:37.770
[laughs]

20:37.770 --> 20:41.373
Oh, no, I think
she sprained her glutes!

20:41.373 --> 20:43.943
In fact, she's dead.

20:43.943 --> 20:49.248
The body-ody-ody count
has only just begun.

20:49.248 --> 20:51.117
And cut.

20:53.586 --> 20:55.521
Yeah!

20:55.521 --> 20:56.755
We're here!

20:56.755 --> 20:58.757
-Whoo!
-It's elimination day,

20:58.757 --> 21:01.694
and I think a lot of these
other girls are really excited,

21:01.694 --> 21:02.962
but they shouldn't be,

21:02.962 --> 21:04.930
because I'm gonna win
the fucking challenge.

21:04.930 --> 21:07.099
[laughs]

21:07.099 --> 21:09.435
Is anybody worried
about their performance?

21:09.435 --> 21:10.970
Why are you looking at me?

21:10.970 --> 21:12.505
[all laugh]

21:12.505 --> 21:13.439
I feel great.

21:13.439 --> 21:16.442
Like, honestly,
I feel like I slayed.

21:16.442 --> 21:18.777
It was just, like, all net,
you know what I mean?

21:18.777 --> 21:21.614
Like, to be so good.

21:21.614 --> 21:23.215
Were you guys okay?
Like, were you intimidated?

21:23.215 --> 21:24.550
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

21:24.550 --> 21:27.853
Are you--I can't--
are you being sarcastic?

21:27.853 --> 21:31.724
Girl, I am being
deeply sarcastic.

21:31.724 --> 21:33.025
I didn't pick that up.

21:33.025 --> 21:34.360
I think us three,
I would say the judges,

21:34.360 --> 21:37.163
we were not as much
of, like, a unit

21:37.163 --> 21:40.666
as I think we were before
we started to go on camera.

21:40.666 --> 21:43.002
I'm panicking, bitch. Whew.

21:43.002 --> 21:44.270
Let's get into drag.

21:44.270 --> 21:45.938
What are you waiting for?

21:45.938 --> 21:47.940
[all scream]

21:50.609 --> 21:54.013
Our scene's so good,
but I'm so worried.

21:54.013 --> 21:54.947
It's just my mom

21:54.947 --> 21:56.982
when she's gonna see me
in underwears on TV.

21:56.982 --> 22:00.085
She's gonna be like,
"Whose child is this?"

22:00.085 --> 22:02.521
What's your relationship
with your parents?

22:02.521 --> 22:03.689
Do they know you're here?

22:03.689 --> 22:05.758
I asked my dad before I left,

22:05.758 --> 22:07.960
I was, like, "Have you heard
of RuPaul's Drag Race?

22:07.960 --> 22:08.861
And he's, like, "No."

22:08.861 --> 22:10.863
He doesn't actually know
that I do drag.

22:10.863 --> 22:11.764
Oh!

22:11.764 --> 22:14.867
My relationship with my dad,
I would say, is evolving.

22:14.867 --> 22:17.870
When I was 16, he told me

22:17.870 --> 22:20.272
that he can't handle
my openly gay lifestyle.

22:20.272 --> 22:21.974
I didn't talk to him
for, like, five years.

22:21.974 --> 22:22.875
But do you feel like

22:22.875 --> 22:24.610
the fact that he doesn't know
you're doing drag

22:24.610 --> 22:28.080
stops you from going, like,
full-on in your drag art?

22:28.080 --> 22:29.215
-No, not at all.
-No?

22:29.215 --> 22:31.417
At this point,
I'm almost 30 years old.

22:31.417 --> 22:33.552
I can do what I fucking want
with my life.

22:33.552 --> 22:35.588
Over the last few years,

22:35.588 --> 22:37.623
my dad has been
really making an effort

22:37.623 --> 22:38.958
to connect with me more

22:38.958 --> 22:40.459
and, like, he checks in on me
all the time.

22:40.459 --> 22:43.262
I told him I was going away
to do something.

22:43.262 --> 22:45.097
And he's, like, asking me
for more information,

22:45.097 --> 22:47.633
but I'm, like, "Well, it's not
gonna be your cup of tea."

22:47.633 --> 22:49.034
And then he was, like,
"You're an adult,

22:49.034 --> 22:50.369
"and you have to do
your own thing,

22:50.369 --> 22:52.171
and don't worry about
what I think about it."

22:52.171 --> 22:53.839
I'm really hoping
that this is an opportunity

22:53.839 --> 22:57.142
for him to learn more about me,
my art form,

22:57.142 --> 22:59.078
and have an appreciation for it.

22:59.078 --> 23:02.648
Actually, the first time my dad
saw me in drag I was so scared,

23:02.648 --> 23:04.350
and all I remember
is being onstage

23:04.350 --> 23:07.019
and he's at
the back of the club,

23:07.019 --> 23:11.290
and he's, like,
"Go, buddy, go, buddy!

23:11.290 --> 23:12.658
That's my kid!"

23:12.658 --> 23:15.127
It was a very special moment.

23:15.127 --> 23:16.762
I stopped the relationship

23:16.762 --> 23:18.964
with all the side
of my father's family.

23:18.964 --> 23:20.666
Same here, yeah.

23:20.666 --> 23:23.269
They treated me like
if I was the son of the devil

23:23.269 --> 23:25.804
because I was gay,

23:25.804 --> 23:28.807
and that
I was gonna burn in hell.

23:28.807 --> 23:31.043
My father, he spied on me,

23:31.043 --> 23:34.880
and he used different names
on Internet

23:34.880 --> 23:36.949
to talk to my boyfriend
at the time,

23:36.949 --> 23:39.985
and destroyed
my first relationship.

23:39.985 --> 23:44.290
My mom's side of the family,
they were there for me.

23:44.290 --> 23:50.863
They were there
in the worst part of my life.

23:50.863 --> 23:53.265
Adriana is actually
the name of my mom.

23:53.265 --> 23:54.933
-Oh!
-Oh!

23:54.933 --> 23:58.337
At the very beginning,
I was kind of her a little bit.

23:58.337 --> 24:02.141
And she didn't know
for the first two years,

24:02.141 --> 24:05.044
until I kind of won
a competition almost.

24:05.044 --> 24:05.944
Third place.

24:05.944 --> 24:08.247
-Kind of won.
-Kind of won.

24:08.247 --> 24:10.215
You might kind of win
this week, too.

27:48.600 --> 27:51.770
I really feel like I'm showing
the judges
something different,

27:51.770 --> 27:54.106
but still with my own twist.

27:54.106 --> 27:55.874
Brooke Lynn:
Kimora Amour.

27:55.874 --> 27:57.976
Kimora: I am coming here
to bless the masses.

27:57.976 --> 28:00.646
Brooke Lynn: Yes-feratu!

28:00.646 --> 28:03.181
Out comes a beautiful succubus,

28:03.181 --> 28:05.250
and oh, oh, wait,
there's more.

28:05.250 --> 28:08.921
Pope hat, go.
Ponytail, inches!

28:08.921 --> 28:10.255
You heard of Cardi B?

28:10.255 --> 28:13.058
Well, this is her auntie,
Cardinal B.

28:13.058 --> 28:15.894
I wanna show all the judges
that I'm versatile.

28:15.894 --> 28:17.663
She can give you
a little bit of camp,

28:17.663 --> 28:20.065
but she can still give you
a little bit of sex.

28:20.065 --> 28:23.569
I can always give you
a little bit of sex.

28:23.569 --> 28:25.370
Brooke Lynn:
Kendall Gender.

28:25.370 --> 28:26.505
Kendall: Oh, heavenly Father,
forgive me,

28:26.505 --> 28:28.874
for I have gotten nasty.

28:28.874 --> 28:29.942
I am serving

28:29.942 --> 28:33.545
the quintessential
good girl gone bad.

28:33.545 --> 28:36.181
Brad: The power of drag
compels you.

28:36.181 --> 28:38.183
The power of drag compels you!

28:38.183 --> 28:43.021
This devil is all about
her curves and swerves, bitch.

28:43.021 --> 28:44.523
Brooke Lynn: Adriana.

28:44.523 --> 28:46.391
Adriana: [speaking French]

28:46.391 --> 28:48.760
I am giving you
Marie Antoinette,

28:48.760 --> 28:51.630
one of the baddest bitches
in herstory.

28:51.630 --> 28:53.398
Amanda: I could just
eat this look up.

28:53.398 --> 28:54.999
Accuse me of treason.

28:54.999 --> 28:59.438
at least I'm having fun and
giving
good head, baby. Ooh!

28:59.438 --> 29:01.540
Brad: She is serving.

29:01.540 --> 29:04.910
This is a perfect example
of what Adriana does best.

29:04.910 --> 29:09.615
It is gorgeous, but it is
horrifying
at the same time.

29:09.615 --> 29:11.783
Bon apptit.

29:11.783 --> 29:12.951
Brooke Lynn: Icesis Couture.

29:12.951 --> 29:14.953
Icesis: My good girl gone bad

29:14.953 --> 29:17.489
is inspired
by a comic book character.

29:17.489 --> 29:19.858
Lady Bunny, we meet again.

29:19.858 --> 29:22.694
I'm feeling strong,
I'm feeling powerful.

29:22.694 --> 29:23.929
I got my bat.

29:23.929 --> 29:26.298
She's a real bad bunny, honey.

29:26.298 --> 29:28.867
She got her mind on her bunny,
and her bunny on her mind.

29:28.867 --> 29:30.502
[all laugh]

29:30.502 --> 29:32.371
And now it's time for the movie

29:32.371 --> 29:36.375
we've all been dying to see:
Screech!

29:36.375 --> 29:38.677
I had to kill
to get these tickets.

29:38.677 --> 29:40.312
Ooh, it's about to start.

29:46.585 --> 29:48.487
Ha ha ha!

29:49.988 --> 29:54.660
It's a new day in the werkroom,
and I'm feeling horny.

29:54.660 --> 29:56.361
I mean, sickening.

29:56.361 --> 29:58.697
Well, I'm feeling witchening.

29:58.697 --> 30:01.566
You're looking at
the next winner, baby.

30:01.566 --> 30:04.136
[laughs]

30:04.136 --> 30:08.306
It was indeed a brand-new day
in the werkroom,

30:08.306 --> 30:11.843
but something very foul
was in the air,

30:11.843 --> 30:16.748
and this time
it wasn't just gas.

30:16.748 --> 30:18.684
[fart]

30:18.684 --> 30:20.118
[laughs] Nice.

30:20.118 --> 30:22.320
So top seven, ladies!

30:22.320 --> 30:23.722
Did you know statistically,

30:23.722 --> 30:29.494
we each have 14.286% chance
of winning the finale!

30:29.494 --> 30:33.465
Top seven?
I'm only counting six.

30:33.465 --> 30:36.101
Girl, did you forget
to count yourself?

30:36.101 --> 30:39.571
Well if I were her,
I would count myself out, too.

30:39.571 --> 30:41.473
[all laugh]

30:41.473 --> 30:42.674
What's wrong, girl?

30:42.674 --> 30:45.077
You seem totally worried.

30:45.077 --> 30:47.646
I just have
this horrible feeling,

30:47.646 --> 30:51.116
like something bad
is gonna happen today.

30:51.116 --> 30:52.718
Aah!

30:52.718 --> 30:56.688
Well, whatever it is,
I'm sure there's an ointment for
it.

30:56.688 --> 30:59.124
But there wasn't an ointment.

30:59.124 --> 31:02.027
There is no ointment for...
[gasps]

31:02.027 --> 31:03.962
murder.

31:03.962 --> 31:06.698
[thunder]

31:06.698 --> 31:10.035
[all scream]

31:10.035 --> 31:12.771
[telephone rings]
Oh, what is that?

31:12.771 --> 31:14.706
What is making that sound?

31:14.706 --> 31:19.010
It's giving me goosebumps
all over my body!

31:19.010 --> 31:22.481
It appears to be coming
from that object over there!

31:22.481 --> 31:23.982
[ring]

31:23.982 --> 31:26.718
Blue, be careful!

31:26.718 --> 31:28.787
Chill, Clitney.
It's just a phone.

31:28.787 --> 31:30.856
What is it gonna do, kill me?

31:30.856 --> 31:34.192
[ring]

31:34.192 --> 31:36.528
Hello. Drag Race residence.

31:36.528 --> 31:40.098
Blue Scarymore speaking.
[laughs]

31:40.098 --> 31:42.334
[heavy breathing]

31:42.334 --> 31:44.903
Sorry, I can't even,
like, hear you right now.

31:44.903 --> 31:47.539
The service in here sucks.

31:47.539 --> 31:50.742
I'm gonna have to put you
on speaker, hon!

31:52.043 --> 31:53.745
[deep voice]
Who's a pretty little girl?

31:53.745 --> 31:55.413
[all scream]

31:55.413 --> 31:57.682
-None of you!
-Was that RuPaul?

31:57.682 --> 32:00.552
Can you ask her
how much she benches?

32:00.552 --> 32:03.455
But that wasn't RuPaul.

32:03.455 --> 32:10.462
That was someone
much, much younger.

32:11.963 --> 32:14.599
Bonjour, bonjour,
bonjour, bitches.

32:14.599 --> 32:18.236
Blessed be the fruit,
gender traitors.

32:18.236 --> 32:22.641
Yes, queen,
Versace boots the house down,

32:22.641 --> 32:26.411
wig, period, tea, mama.

32:26.411 --> 32:28.346
For this week's mini-challenge--

32:28.346 --> 32:32.117
Hush! My daughters,
I can get you out of here.

32:32.117 --> 32:33.485
We leave tomorrow.

32:33.485 --> 32:37.055
When I give you a deep, knowing
glance,
it's time.

32:38.323 --> 32:43.862
I don't know what show she's on,
but, girl, I'm living.

32:46.865 --> 32:49.301
Each of you will have
a chance to audition

32:49.301 --> 32:54.172
for the lead role of the new
drag slasher flick Screech.

32:54.172 --> 32:58.376
And we wanna hear you
scream, queen.

32:58.376 --> 33:00.445
Blue, you're up first.

33:00.445 --> 33:03.014
I am so excited to audition,

33:03.014 --> 33:05.784
but I cannot audition
without my lucky panties.

33:07.152 --> 33:08.620
I'm just gonna go
grab them real quick.

33:08.620 --> 33:11.523
So sorry. BRB!

33:11.523 --> 33:13.225
Well, fuck her, then.

33:13.225 --> 33:15.727
Fairuzah, it's your time.

33:15.727 --> 33:18.463
[clears throat]

33:18.463 --> 33:22.901
[screams and cackles]

33:22.901 --> 33:24.569
[coughs and hacks]

33:24.569 --> 33:27.639
Sounds like
she got a case of the hex.

33:27.639 --> 33:28.640
Next!

33:30.709 --> 33:37.849
[screams]

33:37.849 --> 33:41.419
We said "scream," not "cream."

33:41.419 --> 33:43.054
[scoffs]

33:44.756 --> 33:46.758
Aah!

33:46.758 --> 33:50.328
Aah!

33:50.328 --> 33:52.564
I, uh... Aah!

33:54.833 --> 33:57.369
We have a winner, baby!

33:57.369 --> 34:03.174
We were living for your dead.

34:03.174 --> 34:07.579
Oh, no, I think
she sprained her glutes!

34:07.579 --> 34:09.047
Quite the opposite.

34:09.047 --> 34:11.316
In fact, she's dead.

34:11.316 --> 34:13.351
[all gasp]

34:13.351 --> 34:15.720
[all scream]

34:23.628 --> 34:26.264
It looks like
it's a double penetration!

34:26.264 --> 34:28.166
Lucky girl!

34:28.166 --> 34:29.467
Shut up.

34:29.467 --> 34:33.104
Blue, we love
your dedication to the role.

34:33.104 --> 34:36.041
Other queens, take notes.

34:36.041 --> 34:38.810
Yes, we mustn't let them
see us sweat.

34:38.810 --> 34:41.780
Now, for this week's
act of resistance--

34:41.780 --> 34:43.048
Maxi-challenge.

34:43.048 --> 34:45.684
Right. Maxi-challenge.

34:45.684 --> 34:49.754
Each of you must tailor
a child's Hallow's Eve costume

34:49.754 --> 34:52.157
into a disguise.

34:52.157 --> 34:55.160
Meet me on the runway.
Tell no one.

34:55.160 --> 34:57.662
#Boo.

34:57.662 --> 35:00.231
Racers, start your engines,

35:00.231 --> 35:04.369
and may the best drag queen win.

35:04.369 --> 35:07.205
[all laugh]

35:08.139 --> 35:10.075
One broad was down,

35:10.075 --> 35:13.044
but little do these
filler queens know,

35:13.044 --> 35:17.716
the body-ody-ody count
has only just begun.

35:21.019 --> 35:25.757
And that's how I became
an empress of the dark arts.

35:25.757 --> 35:28.760
Yeah, yeah, your story's
gonna change lives.

35:28.760 --> 35:34.065
When I was little, my mom
left me at a ferry terminal.

35:34.065 --> 35:37.535
I started screwing
a bunch of seamen,

35:37.535 --> 35:40.739
and that's how I ended up
a teenage drag mother.

35:40.739 --> 35:42.974
I had to give the baby up.

35:42.974 --> 35:44.442
Oh!

35:45.977 --> 35:48.513
You know what's even spookier?

35:48.513 --> 35:49.748
What?

35:49.748 --> 35:51.916
I've never met my drag mother.

35:51.916 --> 35:53.118
No!

35:53.118 --> 35:56.187
She put me up for adoption.

35:56.187 --> 35:57.822
All she left me with

35:57.822 --> 36:00.058
was this birthmark
shaped like a potato.

36:00.058 --> 36:02.160
Oh!

36:02.160 --> 36:03.762
[both gasp]

36:03.762 --> 36:05.130
Baby?

36:05.130 --> 36:06.297
Mama?

36:06.297 --> 36:08.466
-Baby!
-Mama!

36:08.466 --> 36:10.969
-Baby!
-Mama!

36:10.969 --> 36:12.637

36:15.607 --> 36:17.342
Let's have a toast.

36:23.114 --> 36:24.082
[gags]

36:24.082 --> 36:25.550
[coughs]

36:25.550 --> 36:27.652
[retches]

36:36.628 --> 36:41.066
Jocklyn, your outfit,
it looks...

36:41.066 --> 36:42.167
interesting.

36:43.835 --> 36:45.570
Ugh.

36:45.570 --> 36:47.872
Oh, it must be
my inner saboteur again.

36:47.872 --> 36:49.574
Jocklyn, I'm not certain

36:49.574 --> 36:52.544
this is the work
of your inner saboteur.

36:52.544 --> 36:55.046
In fact, I'm hypothesizing

36:55.046 --> 36:57.949
that there is
a real saboteur among us.

36:57.949 --> 37:01.286
You mean an outer saboteur?

37:01.286 --> 37:04.155
[sewing machine runs]
Uh-oh!

37:04.155 --> 37:05.790
Oh! Oh!

37:05.790 --> 37:08.426
Aah! Aah! Aah!

37:08.426 --> 37:10.695
-Aah!
-Aah!

37:10.695 --> 37:13.531
[both scream]

37:17.268 --> 37:20.638
Eh, well, I think she'd
want me to have her fabric.

37:21.673 --> 37:25.310
So how are you feeling
about the competition?

37:25.310 --> 37:27.378
Well, it's all so weird,

37:27.378 --> 37:32.784
being here with all the queens
disappearing from the werkroom.

37:32.784 --> 37:34.552
But little
did the judges know...

37:34.552 --> 37:37.655
Nara, who are you talking to?

37:37.655 --> 37:40.792
Woman: Ladies, please report
to the main stage.

37:40.792 --> 37:44.629
I guess I'll see you
on the runway, girl.

37:47.665 --> 37:51.369
Nara walks toward the mirror
to touch up her makeup,

37:51.369 --> 37:54.772
while narrating her every move.

37:54.772 --> 37:56.774
She looks at her reflection,

37:56.774 --> 37:59.410
smiles...

37:59.410 --> 38:02.447
and laughs.

38:03.381 --> 38:06.217
She has absolutely no idea

38:06.217 --> 38:10.455
that the killer is standing
right next to her.

38:10.455 --> 38:12.457
Wait, what?

38:12.457 --> 38:17.328
Aah!

38:18.563 --> 38:22.467
Ladies, I see some of you
made it out.

38:22.467 --> 38:25.637
A-Martha, help!
There's a killer!

38:25.637 --> 38:28.439
Hush, child!
Killers surround us.

38:28.439 --> 38:31.910
You were formidable
in this week's challenge.

38:31.910 --> 38:33.878
I completely agree
with A-Martha.

38:33.878 --> 38:35.046
I love it!

38:35.046 --> 38:37.448
The only thing
you killed tonight

38:37.448 --> 38:39.217
was the art form of drag.

38:39.217 --> 38:42.854
I completely agree with Hooking.
I hate it.

38:42.854 --> 38:46.224
We've made our decision.

38:46.224 --> 38:50.662
I'm sorry, my dears,
but you're both up for
elimination.

39:49.654 --> 39:53.258
Now, that was a lip sync
for your life.

39:53.258 --> 39:55.927
Shantay you stay.

39:55.927 --> 39:58.896
Now take off your mask.

39:58.896 --> 40:01.399
I'd like to keep it on.

40:01.399 --> 40:03.968
All: Please?

40:06.170 --> 40:07.272
No!

40:07.272 --> 40:13.378
-Why?
-Why?

40:13.378 --> 40:16.814
[evil laugh]

40:22.687 --> 40:24.255
[applause]
Oh, so good!

40:24.255 --> 40:26.858
Good job, queens.

40:26.858 --> 40:28.426
Based on your performance
in the film

40:28.426 --> 40:29.961
and your runway presentations,

40:29.961 --> 40:32.330
the judges have made
some decisions.

40:32.330 --> 40:36.934
When I call your name,
please step forward.

40:36.934 --> 40:38.936
Icesis Couture.

40:38.936 --> 40:40.972
Kimora Amour.

40:40.972 --> 40:43.274
Pythia.

40:43.274 --> 40:44.942
Suki Doll.

40:44.942 --> 40:46.544
You are all safe.

40:47.945 --> 40:49.881
You may go untuck
in the werkroom.

40:51.482 --> 40:53.885
Hello, my scream queens.

40:53.885 --> 40:57.889
You represent the tops
and bottoms of the week.

40:57.889 --> 41:00.792
First up, Eve 6000.

41:00.792 --> 41:03.394
So you played Nara Hater.

41:03.394 --> 41:04.295
Mm-hmm.

41:04.295 --> 41:07.098
You made me laugh.
You hit all your jokes.

41:07.098 --> 41:08.433
I thought that it was spot-on.

41:08.433 --> 41:10.134
Thank you.

41:10.134 --> 41:11.469
You were fantastic.

41:11.469 --> 41:15.173
You chose a role that you knew
was going to push you,

41:15.173 --> 41:18.076
and you rose to the occasion,
and I was very proud of that.

41:18.076 --> 41:20.244
You had a bit of a rocky start
in this competition,

41:20.244 --> 41:23.581
and I feel like you're finally
starting to turn a corner,

41:23.581 --> 41:24.816
which is really great to see.

41:24.816 --> 41:25.883
You look beautiful.

41:25.883 --> 41:27.752
-Thank you.
-I love this color combination.

41:27.752 --> 41:29.587
And your booty looks amazing.

41:29.587 --> 41:31.956
[all laugh]
But I wanna see the passion.

41:31.956 --> 41:34.359
There's an awareness and a spark
when you come out on the runway

41:34.359 --> 41:36.828
that you sometimes miss.

41:36.828 --> 41:38.296
Be confident in yourself
when you come out,

41:38.296 --> 41:39.564
and give us a fucking show.

41:39.564 --> 41:41.699
Open up, crack it open,
and see what happens.

41:41.699 --> 41:43.234
Okay.

41:43.234 --> 41:44.569
Next up, we have the artist

41:44.569 --> 41:45.970
formerly known
as Stephanie Prince.

41:45.970 --> 41:47.238
Aow!

41:47.238 --> 41:50.775
You were Clitney Lescott--
great name--

41:50.775 --> 41:54.145
who is anxious and suspicious
of everything.

41:54.145 --> 41:55.480
I got the anxious.

41:55.480 --> 41:57.815
I didn't get
a whole lot of suspicious.

41:57.815 --> 42:00.685
It was all up
kind of on one level,

42:00.685 --> 42:03.154
which was a good level,
and you were good at it.

42:03.154 --> 42:06.691
But I wanted to see
more variety from you.

42:06.691 --> 42:08.593
I really appreciated the fact

42:08.593 --> 42:11.129
that you leaned into the
character
as much as you could.

42:11.129 --> 42:14.499
However, I did ask you
to tone it down.

42:14.499 --> 42:18.403
I wanted you to have
a little more nuance.

42:18.403 --> 42:20.738
But tonight you look adorable
and super sexy.

42:20.738 --> 42:22.140
Thank you.
Adorable is the word.

42:22.140 --> 42:24.809
I think
this is very playful,

42:24.809 --> 42:27.945
fun, definitely
a good girl gone bad.

42:27.945 --> 42:28.913
Thank you.

42:28.913 --> 42:31.182
Next up, Synthia Kiss.

42:31.182 --> 42:32.183
Hi, guys.

42:32.183 --> 42:34.252
Synthia Kiss,
you played A-Martha.

42:34.252 --> 42:39.123
I didn't get the essence
of A-Martha.

42:39.123 --> 42:40.691
Just because
you haven't seen the show

42:40.691 --> 42:44.629
doesn't mean that you don't know
what stern is or serious is.

42:44.629 --> 42:46.731
The moment you slipped up
a couple lines,

42:46.731 --> 42:48.332
I could see you unraveling.

42:48.332 --> 42:50.668
And it doesn't matter
if you are inside.

42:50.668 --> 42:52.437
Right now, I could be having
a panic attack,

42:52.437 --> 42:53.504
but no one will ever know.

42:53.504 --> 42:55.006
-Right.
-Except my therapist.

42:55.006 --> 42:58.409
The performance for me was okay.

42:58.409 --> 43:01.012
It was more of sort of
how you handled the pressure.

43:01.012 --> 43:01.913
It just wasn't funny.

43:01.913 --> 43:03.181
-Yeah.
-You need to make us laugh.

43:03.181 --> 43:04.215
That's what it's all about.

43:04.215 --> 43:05.817
I'm absorbing all of this.

43:05.817 --> 43:08.886
If I ever get a note again,
I will capture it.

43:08.886 --> 43:10.688
You look
rock and roll as fuck.

43:10.688 --> 43:12.356
Everything you're gonna see
on this runway

43:12.356 --> 43:13.658
is by me and my partner.

43:13.658 --> 43:16.961
And I'm just so freaking proud
to show you guys that.

43:16.961 --> 43:19.397
-Gia Metric.
-Hey, girl.

43:19.397 --> 43:21.999
You were so eager and willing
to hit your marks,

43:21.999 --> 43:24.368
asked questions,
were so thorough.

43:24.368 --> 43:25.470
Thank you so much
for saying that.

43:25.470 --> 43:27.672
It was hard for me
to ask questions on set,

43:27.672 --> 43:29.474
because, you know,

43:29.474 --> 43:32.376
sometimes when you're
in the position of asking
questions,

43:32.376 --> 43:33.511
there's a lot of shame

43:33.511 --> 43:35.379
that comes with, you know,

43:35.379 --> 43:37.882
being brave enough
to ask these questions...

43:37.882 --> 43:40.284
So that I was doing the right
thing,
and I was doing...

43:40.284 --> 43:43.654
Making it
so comfortable on set...

43:43.654 --> 43:47.792
Standing here on the stage,
I am so proud to be here...

43:47.792 --> 43:50.695
Re-watching it, I had
some really funny moments.

43:50.695 --> 43:51.896
Obviously,
I'm critiquing myself.

43:51.896 --> 43:53.264
Thanks, Gia.

43:53.264 --> 43:56.400
I also had a fantastic time
watching you on the runway.

43:56.400 --> 44:01.205
So pretty and fun and gross
to look at at the same time.

44:01.205 --> 44:03.174
The earrings
are just to die for.

44:03.174 --> 44:05.510
Just head to toe,
it makes my heart warm.

44:05.510 --> 44:08.646
It definitely did take me until
you
got to the end of the runway

44:08.646 --> 44:10.314
to figure out what it was.

44:10.314 --> 44:11.916
I had to think about it
that much.

44:11.916 --> 44:14.352
Then I was like,
oh, good girl gone bad.

44:14.352 --> 44:16.187
-Did you just get it?
-I just got that!

44:16.187 --> 44:19.257
-Fefe literally just got it!
-You just got it now?

44:19.257 --> 44:21.025
Oh, I get it now!
She went bad.

44:21.025 --> 44:24.195
-Fefe, where have you been?
-Stop it!

44:24.195 --> 44:25.796
Girl, you should have
just tapped on the glass.

44:25.796 --> 44:27.532
I would have told you.

44:27.532 --> 44:30.635
-I'm dead!
-I get it now, I get it.

44:30.635 --> 44:31.802
Hello, Kendall Gender.

44:31.802 --> 44:34.839
Your role as Hooking Hytes,

44:34.839 --> 44:37.708
cold-hearted, bitchy version
of Brooke Lynn Hytes.

44:37.708 --> 44:39.176
-What a stretch.
-I know.

44:39.176 --> 44:40.444
I feel like it was, like,

44:40.444 --> 44:42.880
a little bit under
where it should be.

44:42.880 --> 44:45.483
It wasn't bad. It just could
have been
so much better.

44:45.483 --> 44:46.717
You could have played me bigger.

44:46.717 --> 44:48.052
You could have
played me bitchier.

44:48.052 --> 44:49.020
Yes.

44:49.020 --> 44:50.888
-What do you mean, "Yes?"
-Jeez!

44:50.888 --> 44:51.923
I'll second that.

44:51.923 --> 44:53.090
Guys!

44:53.090 --> 44:56.494
I think going into it, I wanted
to take a little bit of a chance

44:56.494 --> 44:57.929
and do something
a little bit smaller

44:57.929 --> 44:59.297
than what I did last week.

44:59.297 --> 45:01.966
I felt that smallness
coming through.

45:01.966 --> 45:05.102
But I didn't think it was
the worst thing I'd ever seen.

45:05.903 --> 45:07.705
You struggled with lines.

45:07.705 --> 45:09.073
Yes, I think I was going on

45:09.073 --> 45:11.342
a little bit of more
adlibbing, for sure,

45:11.342 --> 45:13.978
and that was a mistake
that I made, I think.

45:13.978 --> 45:16.480
I was just trying to get
the, like, structure of it.

45:16.480 --> 45:18.816
Going forward,
if you're handed a script,

45:18.816 --> 45:20.284
I do suggest you stick to it,

45:20.284 --> 45:21.719
unless it is
an improv challenge.

45:21.719 --> 45:22.620
Totally.

45:22.620 --> 45:24.288
Just because it can shake you
and knock you off center.

45:24.288 --> 45:27.224
Your look on the runway tonight
is nice.

45:27.224 --> 45:28.759
It's very well made.

45:28.759 --> 45:31.329
It's just the obvious
good girl gone bad,

45:31.329 --> 45:32.496
the nun into the devil.

45:32.496 --> 45:33.831
Pythia did the same look.

45:33.831 --> 45:35.333
Hers was a little bit
more interesting.

45:35.333 --> 45:36.434
But I will say

45:36.434 --> 45:39.170
you are always such a joy
to see walk down the runway.

45:39.170 --> 45:40.938
You have great presentation.

45:40.938 --> 45:44.108
Thanks. [exhales]

45:44.108 --> 45:47.178
It is time to clear something up
once and for all.

45:47.178 --> 45:50.815
Is it A-driana?
Is it Ah-driana?

45:50.815 --> 45:51.816
How do we say your name?

45:51.816 --> 45:52.950
Ah-driana.

45:52.950 --> 45:53.985
Ah-driana.

45:53.985 --> 45:56.787
You were playing
Blood and Goreski,

45:56.787 --> 46:00.057
a creepy, devilish version
of Brad Goreski?

46:00.057 --> 46:02.660
-[gasps]
-I was delighted.

46:02.660 --> 46:05.696
I was a tiny bit confused,

46:05.696 --> 46:07.898
but I was really entertained.

46:07.898 --> 46:10.601
You looked like
you were having a lot of fun.

46:10.601 --> 46:14.171
I got the character description
all the way through.

46:14.171 --> 46:16.607
You really leaned into
a character

46:16.607 --> 46:17.708
that I wanna see again.

46:17.708 --> 46:21.412
Like, I wanna see a show
based on Blood and Goreski.

46:21.412 --> 46:22.346
It was so much fun.

46:22.346 --> 46:24.949
It was maniacal, it was crazy,

46:24.949 --> 46:27.284
part Brad, part Count Chocula.

46:27.284 --> 46:29.787
-[laughs]
-Love this look.

46:29.787 --> 46:31.522
It is one of my favorites

46:31.522 --> 46:33.824
of any of
the Drag Race franchises.

46:33.824 --> 46:35.026
Oh, my God.

46:35.026 --> 46:37.461
It's clever, it's fun,
it's beautiful,

46:37.461 --> 46:39.497
it's complex,
it looks like it hurts.

46:39.497 --> 46:40.631
All of the things that I love.

46:40.631 --> 46:42.566
Thank you, queens.

46:42.566 --> 46:44.435
While you go untuck
in the werkroom,

46:44.435 --> 46:46.904
the judges and I
will make popcorn.

46:51.342 --> 46:53.110
I think Eve is on top.

46:53.110 --> 46:54.445
Eve is absolutely on top.

46:54.445 --> 46:56.747
At least this time when she
asked
for a role, it worked.

46:56.747 --> 46:58.983
[all laugh]

46:58.983 --> 47:00.217
Hi, ladies!

47:00.217 --> 47:01.619
-Oh, she's smiling!
-Hello!

47:01.619 --> 47:03.587
How much crying did you do?

47:03.587 --> 47:05.289
No crying this week yet.

47:05.289 --> 47:06.290
Okay, okay.

47:06.290 --> 47:07.658
No howlin' for Eve.

47:09.960 --> 47:13.030
Well, if Eve is not crying, I
am.

47:14.598 --> 47:16.567
-What happened?
-I'm in the bottom.

47:16.567 --> 47:18.202
-No!
-No!

47:18.202 --> 47:19.136
No, she's lying, she's lying.

47:19.136 --> 47:20.705
-No, I am in the bottom.
-No, she's in the bottom.

47:20.705 --> 47:22.940
-Are you serious?
-No, I'm not lying, you guys.

47:22.940 --> 47:24.375
I wish I'm lying.

47:24.375 --> 47:25.309
What they said about Steph

47:25.309 --> 47:27.611
was that she was, like,
up here, and--

47:27.611 --> 47:28.846
And it didn't change.

47:28.846 --> 47:30.948
They loved my energy,
but it was monotone.

47:30.948 --> 47:33.584
Yeah, you got the anxious part,
but not the suspicious.

47:33.584 --> 47:35.853
Which I don't know
what that word means, so...

47:35.853 --> 47:38.956
I'm really hoping the bottom two

47:38.956 --> 47:40.825
will be between Synthia
and Kendall.

47:40.825 --> 47:43.294
I am also in the bottom
for sure.

47:43.294 --> 47:47.131
They said that it was
too understated, which was sad,

47:47.131 --> 47:50.101
because that was definitely,
like, a choice that I made.

47:50.101 --> 47:51.635
I'm not feeling too great.

47:51.635 --> 47:54.939
I feel like
I've let, like, myself down.

47:54.939 --> 47:56.273
I'm also bummed out
because there's a chance

47:56.273 --> 47:58.442
that I could be lip syncing
against Synthia,

47:58.442 --> 47:59.677
and that just adds

47:59.677 --> 48:02.513
a whole 'nother layer
of emotions for me.

48:02.513 --> 48:05.449
I really don't wanna
lip sync against Kendall.

48:05.449 --> 48:08.385
That is just salt to a wound.

48:08.385 --> 48:10.621
Like, we've got history, man.

48:10.621 --> 48:14.024
It was a really shitty
crumbling of a cookie,

48:14.024 --> 48:15.860
the way the parts
had to get given out.

48:15.860 --> 48:16.894
You know why I was worried.

48:16.894 --> 48:18.229
It was a tricky role
to make funny.

48:18.229 --> 48:21.932
Miss Eve, what did the judges
say about you, mama?

48:21.932 --> 48:22.933
I don't know,
it wasn't like Gia's.

48:22.933 --> 48:25.302
Gia's, they were, like,
you're a genius,

48:25.302 --> 48:27.505
and, like, I want you
to do my accounting

48:27.505 --> 48:29.874
and, like, please,
can I suck your toes?

48:29.874 --> 48:31.175
They were, like, all over Gia.

48:31.175 --> 48:35.412
So for mine, it was, like,
a little more tempered.

48:35.412 --> 48:37.615
I don't think you're giving
yourself
enough credit, girl.

48:37.615 --> 48:39.550
Why are you complaining?
You're not in the bottom.

48:39.550 --> 48:42.720
Oh, my God, they're so thirsty
for camera time, these girls.

48:42.720 --> 48:44.255
[laughs]

48:44.255 --> 48:45.656
What's the comment for Adriana?

48:45.656 --> 48:49.426
My look was one of the best
of all Drag Race.

48:49.426 --> 48:51.796
This is the work
of my partner and I.

48:51.796 --> 48:53.597
Come on, come on, love.

48:53.597 --> 48:55.366
Everyone right now
is celebrating

48:55.366 --> 48:57.635
and talking about
how good they are.

48:57.635 --> 48:59.904
I'm just here in a corner,

48:59.904 --> 49:02.306
thinking that
I might be going home.

49:02.306 --> 49:06.410
I just feel fucking stupid.

49:06.410 --> 49:11.916
If I get in the bottom,
I will give it my all.

49:11.916 --> 49:14.285
I will lip sync
for my life, bitch.

49:16.554 --> 49:18.722
Just between us virgins...

49:18.722 --> 49:20.457
[laughs]

49:20.457 --> 49:21.959
What do we think?

49:21.959 --> 49:23.427
Let's start with Eve 6000.

49:23.427 --> 49:24.428
During Screech,

49:24.428 --> 49:26.430
I really think she was the glue
in a lot of ways.

49:26.430 --> 49:28.499
Her timing was bang on,

49:28.499 --> 49:30.401
that it just kind of
made things flow.

49:30.401 --> 49:33.938
Yeah, she played the Nara Hater,
and the Nara Loved Her.

49:33.938 --> 49:35.906
And then tonight on the runway,

49:35.906 --> 49:37.241
the hair, the makeup,

49:37.241 --> 49:40.344
all the way down to that
little pin-up pump,

49:40.344 --> 49:43.047
she just looked
so beautiful tonight.

49:43.047 --> 49:45.416
Beautiful runway, really,
really great in the challenge,

49:45.416 --> 49:47.351
but there's just that
extra oomph that's missing,

49:47.351 --> 49:48.485
you know what I mean?

49:48.485 --> 49:49.920
Stephanie Prince.

49:49.920 --> 49:53.023
Stephanie has great energy,
like a fiery personality.

49:53.023 --> 49:56.293
Unfortunately, it was a bit too
fiery
during the performance.

49:56.293 --> 49:59.530
She was a little frantic
when she was delivering her
lines.

49:59.530 --> 50:00.764
A very one-note performance,

50:00.764 --> 50:03.067
and also kind of
a one-note runway for me.

50:03.067 --> 50:05.269
This is actually
the first time in my life

50:05.269 --> 50:07.338
that I don't think
I'm a friend of Dorothy.

50:07.338 --> 50:08.739
[gasps]

50:08.739 --> 50:09.940
Synthia Kiss.

50:09.940 --> 50:11.742
She came in wrong,

50:11.742 --> 50:13.844
and it went downhill from there.

50:13.844 --> 50:16.747
She had Amanda Brugel,
the character she's playing,

50:16.747 --> 50:20.684
in front of her, to ask her
questions,
you know?

50:20.684 --> 50:22.753
She was Amanda Brutal
in that challenge.

50:22.753 --> 50:25.956
Also, the runway look,
the dress was beautifully made,

50:25.956 --> 50:28.058
but it was just
very frumpy and dumpy,

50:28.058 --> 50:30.995
and it did not give me a sense
of who Synthia Kiss is.

50:30.995 --> 50:31.929
Mm.

50:31.929 --> 50:34.164
Gia Metric
was perfection tonight.

50:34.164 --> 50:35.366
The garment
was beautifully made,

50:35.366 --> 50:37.368
the concept was incredible

50:37.368 --> 50:39.236
And the process to get to--

50:39.236 --> 50:41.205
I mean, it took you
a little longer, Fefe, but--

50:41.205 --> 50:44.575
The process to get
to what the whole concept was,

50:44.575 --> 50:47.511
like, that revelation,
was part of the exciting part.

50:47.511 --> 50:50.514
And in the challenge also,
she was so entertaining.

50:50.514 --> 50:53.117
But I feel like after every
single time
we critique her,

50:53.117 --> 50:54.318
we get an Oscar speech.

50:54.318 --> 50:56.220
I would like to thank
the Academy.

50:56.220 --> 50:58.022
It seems a little put-on
sometimes.

50:58.022 --> 50:59.690
The person that
we met in the werkroom

50:59.690 --> 51:02.359
and the person
that we meet on the runway

51:02.359 --> 51:03.294
are two different people.

51:03.294 --> 51:05.496
One is very performative,
and one is very sincere.

51:05.496 --> 51:07.965
I would like to see more
of that sincerity on the runway

51:07.965 --> 51:08.966
when receiving critiques.

51:08.966 --> 51:10.601
Mm-hmm.

51:10.601 --> 51:12.069
What do we think
about Kendall Gender?

51:12.069 --> 51:13.103
Tonight she told us

51:13.103 --> 51:15.172
that she thought that
it would be good for her

51:15.172 --> 51:16.507
to get an idea of the script.

51:16.507 --> 51:19.810
She purposefully
didn't memorize the lines.

51:19.810 --> 51:21.512
If I did that,
I would be fired.

51:21.512 --> 51:23.047
I thought
it was very interesting

51:23.047 --> 51:26.684
that she made a choice to
play it smaller than last week.

51:26.684 --> 51:28.252
Girl, you're playing
Brooke Lynn Hytes.

51:28.252 --> 51:30.387
Like, you're a big personality.

51:30.387 --> 51:31.789
She wasn't very memorable.

51:31.789 --> 51:33.223
I feel like she can be.

51:33.223 --> 51:34.158
I just wanted more, more, more.

51:34.158 --> 51:36.727
And on the runway, it was fine.

51:36.727 --> 51:38.295
When you have Pythia come out

51:38.295 --> 51:41.165
doing kind of a better version
of what you're doing,

51:41.165 --> 51:44.101
it just felt a little meh
and meh together

51:44.101 --> 51:45.436
for both things for me.

51:45.436 --> 51:48.205
Adriana stole the show.

51:48.205 --> 51:51.408
The runway was smart
and well-tailored and crafted

51:51.408 --> 51:52.943
and intricate and pretty.

51:52.943 --> 51:54.244
Every single element--

51:54.244 --> 51:57.114
the little tiny tassels
hanging off of the trays,

51:57.114 --> 51:59.750
the cake,
the knife in the hair,

51:59.750 --> 52:02.686
every detail was splendid.

52:02.686 --> 52:04.888
It's why I love drag.

52:04.888 --> 52:08.359
And the maxi-challenge was about
coming up with a character,

52:08.359 --> 52:10.527
being funny,
and also being in command

52:10.527 --> 52:12.796
of the material
that you were given,

52:12.796 --> 52:14.698
and she did all of those things.

52:14.698 --> 52:16.633
I thought she did
such a good job.

52:16.633 --> 52:17.701
I really enjoyed her.

52:17.701 --> 52:19.069
I thought she was so funny.

52:19.069 --> 52:21.038
She just has
a beautiful personality,

52:21.038 --> 52:22.706
and she made it her own.

52:22.706 --> 52:25.042
We have a very big decision
to make.

52:25.042 --> 52:28.012
Bring back our Bloody Marys.

52:29.046 --> 52:31.315
Welcome back, queens.

52:31.315 --> 52:32.649
We've made some decisions.

52:35.386 --> 52:39.223
Gia Metric, in the challenge,
you always stole the scene,

52:39.223 --> 52:45.329
and on the runway, my dear,
you were our gangrene queen.

52:45.329 --> 52:46.263
You are safe.

52:46.263 --> 52:47.865
Thank you.

52:47.865 --> 52:49.466
-Safe?
-Safe.

52:49.466 --> 52:50.467
Oh.

52:53.904 --> 52:59.710
Adriana, in the challenge,
you were Brad to the bone,

52:59.710 --> 53:02.212
and your runway look
was the icing on the cake.

53:04.615 --> 53:05.516
Con-drag-ulations.

53:05.516 --> 53:06.917
Oh!

53:06.917 --> 53:09.153
You are the winner
of this week's maxi-challenge.

53:09.153 --> 53:11.121
Oh, my God, thank you so much!

53:11.121 --> 53:14.258
Oh, my God,
I'm the winner this week,

53:14.258 --> 53:16.360
and for an acting challenge!

53:16.360 --> 53:17.928
I'm an actress, baby!

53:17.928 --> 53:20.864
You have won
a $5.000 gift certificate

53:20.864 --> 53:23.600
from our friends at Fabricland.

53:23.600 --> 53:26.637
Yes! Come on, Fabric.

53:26.637 --> 53:29.440
You may join the other girls.

53:33.844 --> 53:36.213
Eve 6000, you are safe.

53:36.213 --> 53:38.415
Please move
to the back of the stage.

53:43.287 --> 53:48.258
Kendall Gender. On the runway,
your look was very Halloween,

53:48.258 --> 53:51.395
but your performance
in the challenge

53:51.395 --> 53:53.163
was very hollow queen.

53:57.234 --> 53:58.202
You are safe.

53:59.736 --> 54:00.971
Oh, my God.

54:00.971 --> 54:02.873
Please join your sisters
at the back of the stage.

54:02.873 --> 54:05.175
Good job, babe.

54:05.175 --> 54:06.443
Thank you guys a lot.

54:06.443 --> 54:09.246
Unfortunately, that means

54:09.246 --> 54:12.182
Synthia Kiss
and Stephanie Prince,

54:12.182 --> 54:13.417
you are both up for elimination.

54:16.253 --> 54:19.923
Two queens stand before us.

54:19.923 --> 54:22.025
Prior to tonight,

54:22.025 --> 54:24.595
you were asked to prepare
a lip sync performance

54:24.595 --> 54:26.263
of Fefe Dobson's Ghost.

54:26.263 --> 54:30.033
This is your last chance
to impress us

54:30.033 --> 54:31.869
and save yourself
from elimination.

54:34.371 --> 54:36.807
The time has come...
[thunder]

54:36.807 --> 54:39.009
for you to lip sync...

54:39.009 --> 54:40.744
for your life.

54:41.945 --> 54:44.181
I don't wanna go home.

54:44.181 --> 54:45.816
I have to kill this.

54:45.816 --> 54:49.653
I have danced
since I was in grade one.

54:49.653 --> 54:51.488
Fefe Dobson,
I will be your ghost.

54:52.856 --> 54:57.394
Good luck,
and don't fuck it up.

Wow, I got emotional.

57:10.460 --> 57:14.598
It takes a lot of courage
to go onstage

57:14.598 --> 57:17.968
and to show yourself
and to be vulnerable.

59:00.036 --> 59:03.039
And remember, stay true north,
strong, and fierce.

59:03.039 --> 59:05.475

the Snatch Game.
[cheering]

59:27.197 --> 59:29.065
Give me a little bit
of your character.

59:29.065 --> 59:30.367
I'm gonna try to guess.

59:30.367 --> 59:32.302
Bitch, I love glitter
and cocaine.

59:33.870 --> 59:35.138
I am your host tonight.

59:35.138 --> 59:38.909
I'm back, back, back again,
because they won't let me leave.

59:38.909 --> 59:41.511
It's nice to see you again,
Rachel.
It's been a while.

59:41.511 --> 59:43.447
It was a little one-note.

59:43.447 --> 59:46.950
You picked a tough character,
and it didn't work.

59:46.950 --> 59:48.118
Send her flowers after this.

59:48.118 --> 59:49.586
