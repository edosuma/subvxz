WEBVTT

00:00.467 --> 00:03.643
- Previously on SWAT...
- I have a hard policy against

00:03.667 --> 00:06.269
dating cops, any cops anywhere.
Let alone on the same team.

00:06.293 --> 00:07.971
- Who's Bonnie?
- I mentioned her, she...

00:07.995 --> 00:10.390
kind of stays at my place now,
sort of getting serious.

00:10.414 --> 00:11.975
So Bonnie wants to seal the deal, huh?

00:11.999 --> 00:13.310
She wants me to meet her parents.

00:13.334 --> 00:15.061
You don't want to marry the one woman.

00:15.085 --> 00:16.730
But you don't want to be so scared

00:16.754 --> 00:18.281
that you, you don't marry
the right one, either.

00:18.305 --> 00:20.567
Not everything came up normal
in my checkup.

00:20.591 --> 00:22.152
You're pregnant?

00:22.176 --> 00:23.203
She's pregnant.

00:23.227 --> 00:24.376
Again. Mm.

00:26.000 --> 00:32.073
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:56.143 --> 00:57.820
For Javi.

01:19.899 --> 01:22.066
Jam. Switch.

01:28.741 --> 01:30.386
Transition drill complete.

01:30.410 --> 01:32.021
Make your weapons safe and holstered.

01:32.045 --> 01:34.857
Damn, Deac. I see you putting
in work with that left hand.

01:34.881 --> 01:36.525
Good job. Somebody's got

01:36.549 --> 01:38.894
a little extra pep in their step
today; I wonder why that is.

01:38.918 --> 01:40.229
Yeah. Hey, what?

01:40.253 --> 01:41.647
You didn't tell these guys yet?

01:41.671 --> 01:43.482
- Tell us what?
- Yeah, what's the word, Deac?

01:43.506 --> 01:46.869
Well, because of, uh, what
Annie went through last year,

01:46.893 --> 01:49.738
the doctor wants to induce
labor to avoid risks.

01:49.762 --> 01:52.741
So I'm gonna work a half
day and have a baby tonight.

01:52.765 --> 01:55.229
- Oh, whoa. Congratulations, man.
- Wow.

01:55.253 --> 01:57.254
Sure beats what I got going tonight.

01:57.278 --> 01:59.055
- Oh, yeah? What's that?
- I got roped into hitting

01:59.079 --> 02:00.673
a single's bar with this
guy as his wingman.

02:00.698 --> 02:01.913
What?

02:01.938 --> 02:04.553
Valentine's Day is a great
time to meet girls.

02:04.577 --> 02:05.838
Or so I'm told.

02:06.443 --> 02:07.423
What about you, Chris?

02:07.447 --> 02:09.463
Hibachi and fondue with Ty and Kiera,

02:09.487 --> 02:11.094
but let me know when it's a
goodtime to go

02:11.118 --> 02:12.512
visit my new goddaughter later.

02:12.536 --> 02:14.264
Hibachi and fondue, huh?

02:14.288 --> 02:15.732
That sounds romantic.

02:15.756 --> 02:17.350
Where do you, where do you go for that?

02:17.374 --> 02:18.685
Whipping it all up at home.

02:18.709 --> 02:20.520
I've already spent too
much money on the gifts.

02:20.544 --> 02:22.522
It's Valentine's Day, not an anniversary.

02:22.546 --> 02:24.858
It's expensive dating two people.

02:24.882 --> 02:26.443
What about you?

02:26.467 --> 02:28.411
Word from Bonnie is,
you got a big night tonight.

02:28.435 --> 02:30.530
Yeah, I guess. Uh, dinner at
her favorite sushi place,

02:30.554 --> 02:32.782
maybe a moonlit walk on the beach.

02:32.806 --> 02:34.351
What you got brewing tonight, Hondo?

02:34.375 --> 02:36.036
Me? I got a little something-something

02:36.060 --> 02:37.871
happening a little later
tonight, but that's all you get.

02:37.895 --> 02:40.290
I got to keep it PG right now.

02:40.314 --> 02:41.925
Hey, kid. Let's go, you and me.

02:41.949 --> 02:44.427
- Head-to-head.
- What if I win?

02:44.451 --> 02:46.262
You might get a box of chocolates.

02:46.286 --> 02:48.487
- Better be heart-shaped.
- Let's go.

02:50.157 --> 02:52.469
Okay, whoa, whoa. Flag's up.

02:52.493 --> 02:53.740
Flag's up.

02:57.869 --> 02:58.953
Officer shot.

02:58.977 --> 02:59.976
Let's move.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.540
Move.

03:07.674 --> 03:08.818
Central Division's currently looking

03:08.842 --> 03:10.070
for multiple shooters.

03:10.094 --> 03:11.955
Search starting at Lochlyn and Pacific.

03:11.979 --> 03:14.290
That's the rec center in South L.A.

03:14.314 --> 03:16.159
They know if our guy
was undercover? Vice?

03:16.183 --> 03:17.744
Word I got is he was a patrol cop

03:17.768 --> 03:19.651
- on break, just parked.
- What? Shot in his cruiser?

03:21.438 --> 03:22.999
We know our guy's name yet?

03:23.023 --> 03:24.634
Not until the family's been notified.

03:25.497 --> 03:26.753
All right, on my mark we convene at

03:26.777 --> 03:28.805
mobile command on
Imperial and South Central

03:28.829 --> 03:30.779
one hour from now.

03:33.696 --> 03:35.340
Let's do what we do best.

03:35.365 --> 03:36.334
His family's counting on us.

03:45.796 --> 03:47.357
Got anything, Burrows?

03:47.381 --> 03:48.858
Multiple bullet trajectories.

03:48.882 --> 03:50.827
Three shooters on this hit.

03:50.851 --> 03:53.363
Witnesses either too far or too scared

03:53.387 --> 03:54.781
to give us any descriptions.

03:54.805 --> 03:56.950
We got casings going to Ballistics?

03:56.974 --> 03:58.451
Didn't find any casings, guys.

03:58.475 --> 04:00.120
So they used revolvers.

04:00.144 --> 04:02.038
Sounds like they had a plan.

04:02.062 --> 04:04.207
We're gonna lead the search
south of Jordan Downs.

04:04.231 --> 04:05.675
Copy that, hop in.

04:05.699 --> 04:07.210
You guys know who the officer was?

04:07.234 --> 04:08.878
- Pete Schwartz.
- Pete Schwartz?

04:08.902 --> 04:11.681
Yeah, uh, spent the last two
years with him at Central.

04:11.705 --> 04:13.216
Real hard charger, good dude.

04:13.240 --> 04:14.551
Has a wife and two kids.

04:14.575 --> 04:16.575
Paramedics say he's 50/50.

04:17.711 --> 04:18.721
You know him?

04:18.745 --> 04:20.140
Yeah, I worked with him once.

04:20.164 --> 04:22.725
He come to you guys from the Street
Crime Unit in Glassell Park?

04:22.749 --> 04:24.060
Yeah.

04:24.084 --> 04:25.250
All right, let's get going.

04:27.254 --> 04:29.899
It's got to be
a local set to hit a rec center

04:29.923 --> 04:31.201
at peak hours in broad daylight.

04:31.225 --> 04:32.652
Well, this is Los Mags territory.

04:32.676 --> 04:34.904
Only group I can think of
brazen enough to do this.

04:34.928 --> 04:37.679
Glad we have you
to knock on their doors now.

04:39.054 --> 04:40.877
We canvassing security footage?

04:40.901 --> 04:43.194
Yeah, no cameras on any houses
and nearby buildings

04:43.218 --> 04:44.476
picked up anything.

04:45.239 --> 04:47.000
Our shooters might have been
casing our cop.

04:47.024 --> 04:48.683
Knew his rounds, that he'd be here.

04:48.707 --> 04:50.014
Officer did volunteer hours

04:50.038 --> 04:52.222
at the rec center for Operation Progress.

04:52.246 --> 04:55.008
Whoever they are, the shooters
came and left on foot.

04:55.032 --> 04:56.926
Entry gate has a license plate scanner.

04:56.950 --> 04:58.261
We already ran them from earlier today,

04:58.285 --> 04:59.596
all came up clean.

04:59.620 --> 05:01.264
Then these guys are long gone by now.

05:01.288 --> 05:02.682
And so far, no one's talking.

05:03.787 --> 05:05.590
I know someone who will.

05:11.169 --> 05:13.026
Little Maurice got got?

05:13.505 --> 05:14.744
When that go down, man?

05:14.768 --> 05:16.112
Last week.

05:16.136 --> 05:18.114
Neighborhood newspaper never lies, Hondo.

05:18.138 --> 05:20.366
Everything that happens to or by Los Mags

05:20.390 --> 05:21.868
gets written on that wall.

05:21.892 --> 05:23.620
Don't see no cops' name, do you?

05:23.644 --> 05:24.954
You're telling me this ain't even

05:24.978 --> 05:26.873
a set of Mags coming out of Jordan Downs?

05:27.269 --> 05:29.626
Nah. Or a rival crew
in from Hacienda Village.

05:29.650 --> 05:31.094
I'd know, Hondo.

05:31.118 --> 05:32.795
Trust me, we'd both know by now.

05:32.819 --> 05:34.214
All right, well, look,
somebody took down a cop, Trae.

05:34.238 --> 05:35.798
Now come on, man.

05:35.822 --> 05:37.600
Ain't a traphouse in Watts
you don't know about.

05:37.624 --> 05:39.219
So how come this one got you stuck?

05:39.531 --> 05:40.803
Don't tell me you're losing a step, man.

05:40.827 --> 05:43.106
Man, keep slander out your mouth.

05:43.130 --> 05:45.942
Nobody got no beef with cops
in this area, Hondo.

05:45.966 --> 05:47.560
Wasn't no retribution.

05:47.584 --> 05:49.479
You reached out to
the Farmtown 12 in Nobu Gardens?

05:49.503 --> 05:50.980
Man, they reached out to me.

05:51.334 --> 05:53.116
Nobody want po-po coming around

05:53.140 --> 05:54.901
shooting first, asking questions later.

05:55.463 --> 05:56.736
Things were actually improving

05:56.760 --> 05:58.071
between us and the police.

05:58.095 --> 05:59.405
Ain't gonna be that way no more.

05:59.429 --> 06:00.657
Not after this.

06:00.681 --> 06:02.242
And your boys coming at everyone hard.

06:02.266 --> 06:04.294
Nah, nah, ain't gonna
let that happen, man.

06:04.318 --> 06:06.079
All right, I guess I'm
looking for a crew that

06:06.103 --> 06:08.164
got something more than gang
beef, but in the meantime,

06:08.188 --> 06:10.188
you keep your head low,
you understand me?

06:12.276 --> 06:14.170
My nephew's going to Verbum Dei.

06:14.194 --> 06:16.923
Been in Operation Progress
for two years on, praise God.

06:16.947 --> 06:19.142
- I know that's right.
- He's gonna go to college, Hondo.

06:19.166 --> 06:21.311
That's the only game
I'm running right now.

06:21.615 --> 06:23.201
I'm proud of you, man.

06:27.674 --> 06:29.185
Hondo.

06:30.165 --> 06:31.988
The other search areas are clear, too.

06:32.012 --> 06:33.323
No sign of our shooters.

06:33.793 --> 06:36.442
And I just got word that Officer Schwartz

06:36.466 --> 06:38.861
passed away five minutes
ago at the hospital.

06:38.885 --> 06:40.196
Chief's with the immediate family

06:40.220 --> 06:41.614
and assistant chiefs and chaplain

06:41.638 --> 06:42.865
are taking them to MLK.

06:42.889 --> 06:44.784
Robbery-Homicide will
run point from now on

06:44.808 --> 06:46.169
out of our mobile command.

06:46.193 --> 06:47.828
We're gonna need all hands on deck.

06:47.852 --> 06:50.061
We're also rotating Mumford
and Vandelli's teams in.

06:54.231 --> 06:55.817
Officer.

07:00.657 --> 07:02.822
Be careful.

07:05.879 --> 07:13.887
Synced & corrected by -robtor-
www.addic7ed.com

07:43.295 --> 07:44.594
Captain.

07:44.594 --> 07:45.988
Just spoke with Hondo.

07:46.012 --> 07:48.040
Until RHD comes back
with intel on our shooters,

07:48.064 --> 07:49.742
I was gonna head over to MLK.

07:49.766 --> 07:51.577
Pay my respects to the officer's family.

07:51.601 --> 07:52.911
- You knew him?
- Yeah.

07:52.935 --> 07:54.496
I did a stint with his Street Crime Unit

07:54.520 --> 07:56.415
six years ago when I was K-9
in Glassell Park.

07:56.439 --> 07:57.750
I heard about that team.

07:57.774 --> 07:59.418
- Made a lot of arrests.
- Yeah, I used Champ

07:59.442 --> 08:00.919
to sniff out drug hides and stash houses.

08:00.943 --> 08:03.088
I spent the summer
with Schwartz and his team

08:03.112 --> 08:05.340
- cleaning up that part of town.
- I didn't know that.

08:05.364 --> 08:07.176
I'm sorry this hits close for you.

08:07.200 --> 08:09.728
Yeah. Schwartz was, um, a go-getter.

08:10.309 --> 08:11.897
I didn't know he went back to patrol.

08:11.921 --> 08:14.751
- He was detective grade back then.
- A lot can happen in six years.

08:14.775 --> 08:16.568
Never imagined this, though.

08:16.592 --> 08:17.770
Captain.

08:17.794 --> 08:19.354
Got a lead on our shooters.

08:19.378 --> 08:21.359
Hospital's gonna have to wait.

08:22.098 --> 08:23.909
Mizael "Tuzo" Martinez.

08:23.933 --> 08:25.611
L2D gang leader and multiple offender.

08:25.635 --> 08:27.362
You think this guy's
graduated from running drugs

08:27.386 --> 08:29.748
- to being a cop killer?
- DEA reached out.

08:29.772 --> 08:31.583
Wire taps they got
from a joint task force

08:31.607 --> 08:33.284
have Martinez talking retaliation

08:33.308 --> 08:35.788
for one of his captains getting
arrested a couple weeks ago.

08:35.812 --> 08:38.090
The arresting officer? Pete Schwartz.

08:38.114 --> 08:40.092
They could have dropped us
a line if they thought

08:40.116 --> 08:41.960
- something was up, don't you think?
- What's more important

08:41.984 --> 08:43.860
to them, a cop's life
or building a RICO case?

08:43.884 --> 08:45.931
I get it. I think sharing this

08:45.955 --> 08:47.350
was the DEA's version of an olive branch.

08:47.374 --> 08:48.817
Look, the intel's promising,

08:48.841 --> 08:50.469
but if the recordings
are from two weeks ago...

08:50.493 --> 08:51.937
Could've taken him this long to plan it.

08:51.961 --> 08:53.138
We definitely have to talk to him;

08:53.162 --> 08:54.306
best lead we have so far.

08:54.330 --> 08:56.141
The word is, he stays in the Kerlon block

08:56.165 --> 08:57.810
in Nobu Gardens; that project's no joke.

08:57.834 --> 08:59.478
That's gonna be a tough extraction.

08:59.502 --> 09:01.613
- If he hasn't fled by now.
- One of my CIs says

09:01.637 --> 09:03.949
he hasn't moved from
the area in the last 36 hours.

09:03.973 --> 09:06.624
Maybe he's making himself visible
there so he'd have an alibi.

09:06.649 --> 09:09.454
You think he'd stick around city
limits with this much heat on him?

09:09.478 --> 09:10.653
No, running would make him look guilty.

09:10.678 --> 09:12.991
One thing he is not is impulsive.

09:13.015 --> 09:14.660
He rarely leaves the block, which is why

09:14.684 --> 09:16.962
it's been so hard for the feds
to make a case on him.

09:16.986 --> 09:20.299
Former World War II barracks
turned into a housing project.

09:20.323 --> 09:21.682
The perfect bunker.

09:21.706 --> 09:23.001
LAPD's never raided that compound

09:23.025 --> 09:24.336
in broad daylight before.

09:24.360 --> 09:26.138
- Considered it too dangerous.
- Yeah.

09:26.162 --> 09:27.594
We can't do a Contain and Callout.

09:27.618 --> 09:30.058
His homies have shot into crowds
before to get away from police.

09:30.082 --> 09:31.844
Yeah, and put bounties on injured cops.

09:31.868 --> 09:34.239
Zero-sum game, but it gets you
a badge of honor in the pen.

09:34.263 --> 09:36.478
We need a plan that doesn't
give them time to prepare,

09:36.502 --> 09:38.317
or let lookouts warn Martinez to run.

09:39.104 --> 09:40.936
Police presence is high
in that neighborhood.

09:40.960 --> 09:42.187
With our perimeter just up the road,

09:42.211 --> 09:43.822
we'll look like spillover from Watts.

09:43.846 --> 09:46.158
So, we come in from above,
we fast-rope down.

09:46.778 --> 09:49.328
I'll lead Red Team's staggered
entry, shallow to deep.

09:49.352 --> 09:51.446
And we use non-lethal
rounds for crowd control.

09:51.470 --> 09:52.948
That'll help us get Martinez out.

09:52.972 --> 09:54.833
Blue team will pick you up on the ground

09:54.857 --> 09:57.141
and bring you back here.
Let's go get him.

10:04.533 --> 10:06.178
Air 17 to Command.

10:06.202 --> 10:07.379
Inbound to location.

10:07.403 --> 10:10.682
D-Team be advised, 30 seconds to target.

10:11.344 --> 10:13.218
This is 20-David to Command.

10:13.242 --> 10:16.829
Exfil point clear on the Kerlon
block, northwest outlet. Copy.

10:16.853 --> 10:18.357
Roger that, 20-David.

10:18.381 --> 10:20.080
Blue Team standing by for your signal.

10:26.756 --> 10:28.901
D-Team, go for entry.

10:28.925 --> 10:30.224
Ropes away.

10:40.603 --> 10:42.446
Tan and I are secure on the rooftop.

10:42.470 --> 10:44.438
Send down the gear.

10:49.532 --> 10:50.925
Got it.

11:07.763 --> 11:11.048
Chopper away. We are go for ingress.

11:19.976 --> 11:21.331
Go, go.

11:29.652 --> 11:30.963
Freeze! Police!

11:30.987 --> 11:32.881
Tuzo Martinez, you're under arrest!

11:32.905 --> 11:34.466
LAPD SWAT! Don't move!

11:34.490 --> 11:36.935
Turn around! Get your ass down!

11:36.959 --> 11:38.220
- Hands behind your back.
- Give me your hands!

11:38.244 --> 11:40.272
Revolver. Same as our shooter's.

11:40.296 --> 11:42.107
The serial number's been
filed off, that's illegal.

11:42.131 --> 11:43.642
Whose gun is this?

11:43.666 --> 11:45.144
What if I said it's mine?

11:45.168 --> 11:47.396
- Then you'd be covering for your dad.
- It ain't worth it, kid.

11:47.420 --> 11:49.815
- Against the wall!
- Is that your dad's gun?

11:49.839 --> 11:51.483
Celebrating Valentine's ain't illegal.

11:51.507 --> 11:53.151
- Stop resisting! Hey! Stop!
- Yeah.

11:53.175 --> 11:54.558
Now show me a damn warrant.

11:54.583 --> 11:56.955
You're wanted for questioning in the
death of Officer Peter Schwartz.

11:56.979 --> 11:58.323
This is 20-David to Command,

11:58.347 --> 11:59.791
we have confirmation on the package.

11:59.815 --> 12:01.660
Air 17, hold your perimeter.

12:01.684 --> 12:03.295
Blue Team, we are go for exfil.

12:03.319 --> 12:04.550
Blue Team's 30 seconds out.

12:04.574 --> 12:06.081
Proceed to Kerlon and Pacific.

12:10.026 --> 12:12.239
- What do we do with his girl?
- And the kid?

12:13.049 --> 12:14.840
Hondo, we got a situation.

12:14.864 --> 12:16.135
Kerlon exit's blocked.

12:19.097 --> 12:22.014
I count 30, 40 hostiles
approaching from the north.

12:22.038 --> 12:23.768
Looks like everyone knows we're here.

12:26.125 --> 12:27.605
Somebody's got eyes on us.

12:30.880 --> 12:32.107
There.

12:32.318 --> 12:33.992
There's a lookout
in the adjacent building

12:34.016 --> 12:35.827
- with a two-way radio.
- All right, listen up.

12:35.851 --> 12:37.696
We're here for Martinez.
Leave the woman and kid.

12:37.720 --> 12:39.531
It's gonna be hard enough
getting him out of here.

12:39.555 --> 12:40.499
Deacon, take Chris.

12:40.523 --> 12:42.367
Contain that lookout, pget his radio.

12:42.391 --> 12:44.289
You're not taking me in, right?

12:46.225 --> 12:47.702
You know what? Today's your lucky day.

12:47.980 --> 12:49.530
Why don't you work on your taste in men?

12:54.153 --> 12:56.465
My boys ain't gonna let you take me.

12:56.489 --> 12:58.050
Why don't you just leave me here?

12:58.074 --> 12:59.634
- Call it even.
- No chance.

12:59.658 --> 13:02.020
LAPD! Stay right there
with your hands in the air.

13:02.044 --> 13:03.355
Now! Do it now!

13:03.379 --> 13:04.759
Command to Blue Team.

13:04.783 --> 13:07.392
Move to the southern end
of Kerlon to exfil the team.

13:07.416 --> 13:11.363
Hey, Luca, I got him. Get us out
of here. Let's go, go. Move.

13:11.387 --> 13:14.566
- Street, go! Tan, move!
- Go, go, go, go, go!

13:14.590 --> 13:15.589
Move.

13:17.697 --> 13:19.681
Lookout's upstairs. Corner unit.

13:19.705 --> 13:21.242
Go. I got your back.

13:22.431 --> 13:24.910
Hey, it's okay. It's okay. Shh. Policia.

13:28.020 --> 13:29.603
Yeah, go.

13:34.527 --> 13:35.887
Police.

13:35.911 --> 13:37.506
Stop right there.

13:39.010 --> 13:40.008
Police!

13:40.032 --> 13:42.032
Hands in the air!

14:00.970 --> 14:03.248
- All of you, back inside.
- What, pig?

14:03.272 --> 14:05.256
You gonna shoot an unarmed man?

14:05.280 --> 14:07.786
- Or all 20 of us?
- Deac, fall back.

14:09.895 --> 14:11.540
Move, move, move.

14:11.564 --> 14:14.209
This is 20-David to Command.
Package en route.

14:14.233 --> 14:15.449
Let's go, let's go.

14:16.485 --> 14:18.470
Bad news at the south exit.

14:18.494 --> 14:19.801
No better on the north.

14:20.489 --> 14:21.989
We could use some help.

14:32.468 --> 14:35.135
51-David. Shots fired! Shots fired!

14:37.173 --> 14:38.984
This is 20-David.
I need a visual on the shooter.

14:39.008 --> 14:40.485
Bald head. Northwest!

14:40.509 --> 14:42.988
D-Team, maintain non-lethal rounds.

14:43.012 --> 14:44.656
Teenagers and women in the crowd.

14:44.680 --> 14:46.791
Street, move, go. Go, go, go, go, go.

14:50.186 --> 14:51.830
I got him.

14:51.854 --> 14:53.498
25-David to Air 17.

14:53.522 --> 14:55.417
Got visual on a fire
coming from obstructions

14:55.441 --> 14:57.085
at the southern exfil point. Copy.

14:57.109 --> 14:59.004
Air 17, have visual on multiple barriers

14:59.028 --> 15:02.307
blocking ingress. No ground
access to your position.

15:02.331 --> 15:04.698
Repeat, no ground access
to your position.

15:06.952 --> 15:09.648
He's stalling. Waiting for his homies.

15:09.672 --> 15:11.689
I'll drag him out of here if I have to.

15:11.713 --> 15:13.935
Hondo, I'm clocked at 70-80 bangers

15:13.959 --> 15:16.938
approaching from the south. We
got hostiles on both ends now.

15:16.962 --> 15:18.490
This is 20-David to Command.

15:18.514 --> 15:19.774
The alley is blocked.

15:19.798 --> 15:22.027
Roll Armored to the northwest
side of Craddock Avenue.

15:22.051 --> 15:23.495
Meet you there with the package.

15:23.519 --> 15:25.197
On your feet.

15:33.395 --> 15:36.374
LAPD! Get back!
Don't move! On the ground!

15:36.398 --> 15:38.176
Get back! Now! Now!

15:38.200 --> 15:40.400
Against the wall. Come here.
Against the wall, now.

15:42.404 --> 15:44.799
Hondo, we need an exit plan, now.

15:46.992 --> 15:49.554
Do not come closer! Get back now!

15:55.167 --> 15:56.647
Back up, back up.

16:01.890 --> 16:03.068
Here we go.

16:03.092 --> 16:06.037
Three, two, one... Get down!

16:06.061 --> 16:07.739
Breach!

16:07.763 --> 16:09.291
Go, go, go, go, go!

16:09.315 --> 16:10.347
Move, move.

16:11.704 --> 16:13.600
Hold it right there!

16:15.104 --> 16:17.582
Move, come on! Through the hole!

16:17.606 --> 16:18.883
Let's go, let's go.

16:22.444 --> 16:25.423
Do not move! Do not move!

16:25.447 --> 16:28.343
Y'all treating me like the president.

16:28.367 --> 16:31.418
Back up! We can't
hold them. There's too many.

16:35.291 --> 16:38.436
Retreat, Deac! Fall back to exfil!

16:38.460 --> 16:39.626
Fall back!

16:42.715 --> 16:43.942
Get in here!

16:43.966 --> 16:45.132
Go, go!

16:48.304 --> 16:51.366
This is 20-David, package secure.

16:51.390 --> 16:53.451
D-Team is clear.

16:53.475 --> 16:54.789
Headed back to base.

17:10.459 --> 17:12.971
Makes you think about what's
really important, doesn't it?

17:12.994 --> 17:14.271
You mean, getting the guy responsible

17:14.296 --> 17:16.273
for putting one of us in the dirt?

17:16.298 --> 17:20.228
That, plus sometimes
you take things for granted.

17:20.897 --> 17:23.818
You forget it can all be gone,
in one moment.

17:25.278 --> 17:26.483
It's been, like, over a month

17:26.508 --> 17:29.154
since I spent some
quality time with my pops.

17:29.178 --> 17:30.739
You should invite him over to the house.

17:30.763 --> 17:32.201
Think I will.

17:32.514 --> 17:34.959
What's going on with your mom?
I mean, you see her lately?

17:34.983 --> 17:36.580
We're still not talking.

17:37.748 --> 17:39.895
Hey. Your girl blowing up your phone?

17:39.919 --> 17:41.838
Yeah, especially with her
watching the news and all.

17:41.862 --> 17:43.542
Yeah, you can't blame her
for being worried.

17:43.566 --> 17:44.913
Yeah, it's gonna be a big relief for her

17:44.937 --> 17:46.304
when I walk through that door tonight.

17:46.328 --> 17:48.673
Hell, yeah. Especially with you
popping the question, huh?

17:48.697 --> 17:50.759
What? No.

17:50.783 --> 17:52.811
Dude, Bonnie's been texting us on the DL.

17:52.835 --> 17:54.813
She's reading into this big production.

17:54.837 --> 17:56.931
She's expecting you to get
on one knee tonight.

17:56.955 --> 17:58.983
You telling me that's not happening?

17:59.395 --> 18:00.518
No.

18:00.938 --> 18:03.104
You had her move in with you
after five months,

18:03.128 --> 18:05.323
she came to Deac and
Annie's vow renewals,

18:05.347 --> 18:07.025
and now you're taking her to
her favorite sushi restaurant

18:07.049 --> 18:08.660
before a moonlit walk on the beach

18:08.684 --> 18:10.028
on Valentine's Day?

18:10.052 --> 18:12.530
That's leading the witness, playboy.

18:12.554 --> 18:14.449
I mean, yeah, we're-we're
headed in that direction,

18:14.473 --> 18:16.497
but I wasn't gonna propose any time soon.

18:16.521 --> 18:18.002
Okay, what did you get her tonight?

18:18.831 --> 18:20.455
- A teddy bear.
- A teddy bear?

18:20.479 --> 18:22.507
- It's big.
- Oh, my...

18:22.531 --> 18:23.958
You're just gonna wreck this whole thing.

18:23.982 --> 18:26.211
It's all right, Street and I got a couch

18:26.235 --> 18:28.652
with your name on it
when she kicks you out.

18:30.906 --> 18:32.384
Swear to God,

18:32.408 --> 18:34.386
I'm gonna pop a cap in that pig's face

18:34.410 --> 18:37.389
so his mother can't have an
open casket for his sorry ass.

18:37.413 --> 18:39.557
That's after Officer Schwartz

18:39.581 --> 18:41.630
arrested one of your captains
a couple weeks ago.

18:41.654 --> 18:42.961
In addition to the two counts

18:42.985 --> 18:45.230
of illegal handgun possession
we've got you on, that recording

18:45.254 --> 18:47.031
will play well for a jury

18:47.055 --> 18:48.566
on capital murder of a police officer.

18:48.590 --> 18:51.369
Mm-hmm. Ese, that's just talk.

18:51.393 --> 18:53.238
I ain't dumb enough to go after no cop.

18:53.262 --> 18:54.823
That's a death sentence.

18:54.847 --> 18:56.741
Where were you at 10:18
this morning, then?

18:56.765 --> 19:01.079
At home, in my living room,
watching some game show.

19:01.103 --> 19:03.748
- Got anyone to confirm that?
- Nah, querida.

19:03.772 --> 19:06.050
My son wasn't back from school.

19:06.074 --> 19:08.420
My old lady, she hadn't come by yet.

19:08.444 --> 19:10.004
Help yourself out.

19:10.028 --> 19:12.507
Tell us where your
two accomplices are hiding.

19:12.531 --> 19:15.677
So you're telling me that
I couldn't pull off a hit alone?

19:16.263 --> 19:19.898
If I need to handle a grudge,
I roll solo, dawg.

19:19.922 --> 19:22.183
You think this is funny, circus freak?

19:22.207 --> 19:25.520
Hey! I lost a captain to you fools,

19:25.544 --> 19:27.650
so I was mad.

19:29.465 --> 19:31.743
Being pissed at pigs ain't a crime.

19:31.767 --> 19:33.778
I was fronting for my jainas.

19:34.365 --> 19:36.531
Spitting big game, you know.

19:37.076 --> 19:38.950
Acting hard.

19:39.870 --> 19:41.786
You just happened to catch me playing.

19:41.810 --> 19:43.254
Yeah, I don't think so.

19:43.278 --> 19:45.145
Your alibi is weak.

19:58.126 --> 19:59.626
This is for Javi.

20:09.338 --> 20:11.838
Help me!

20:14.309 --> 20:15.487
It's only a matter of time

20:15.511 --> 20:16.654
before we catch your buddies

20:16.678 --> 20:18.790
and they give you up.

20:18.814 --> 20:20.658
Another cop just got shot now.

20:24.937 --> 20:27.153
How's my alibi look for this one?

20:31.228 --> 20:32.572
It's the same group of shooters.

20:32.596 --> 20:34.074
Witness saw two of them flee
on foot down Rossmore.

20:34.098 --> 20:36.543
Cop winged the third, suspect
fled into an office nearby

20:36.567 --> 20:37.744
and he's hiding out inside.

20:37.768 --> 20:39.212
The owner said the office is closed.

20:39.236 --> 20:40.914
Should be empty, no innocents involved.

20:40.938 --> 20:43.750
However, the business
is Assault Rifle Technologies.

20:43.774 --> 20:45.335
It's a weapons R&D site.

20:45.359 --> 20:46.670
Shooter may have grabbed up more guns,

20:46.694 --> 20:47.921
so be ready for anything.

20:47.945 --> 20:49.832
The best efforts to take this guy alive

20:49.856 --> 20:51.091
so he can lead us to the other shooters.

20:51.115 --> 20:53.727
- We get an ID on the second victim yet?
- Not yet,

20:53.751 --> 20:55.762
but he's Hollywood Division
and we all got friends there.

20:55.786 --> 20:57.764
- Where they transporting him to?
- St. Mary's Hospital.

20:57.788 --> 21:00.233
Two cops in one day, same MO

21:00.257 --> 21:01.744
Who says it's gonna stop there?

21:23.474 --> 21:25.458
Guess there's no way
to stop the alarm now.

21:25.482 --> 21:27.482
No. It sure looks like he tried, though.

21:30.454 --> 21:31.882
He in?

21:31.906 --> 21:33.488
- No.
- Okay.

21:36.660 --> 21:38.827
Nothing.

21:53.587 --> 21:56.340
Bathroom's clear,
but our shooter's been here.

21:59.176 --> 22:01.628
Looks like he downed the whole
bottle of rubbing alcohol.

22:01.652 --> 22:04.497
Be advised, our shooter
may have some pep to him.

22:04.521 --> 22:06.642
Four, four. Four.

22:11.862 --> 22:13.340
Whoa!

22:13.364 --> 22:15.926
22-David, suspect's got
an automatic weapon!

22:15.950 --> 22:17.987
Headed to the second floor!

22:52.403 --> 22:53.713
Move.

22:53.737 --> 22:56.154
Cover, cover, cover!

23:03.282 --> 23:05.225
This is 20-David to Command, be advised,

23:05.249 --> 23:08.287
suspect is headed down the exit
stairwell to the back alley.

23:23.233 --> 23:24.676
Drop the gun!

23:24.700 --> 23:27.080
Face down on the ground, now!

23:27.104 --> 23:29.082
Get down on the ground!

23:29.106 --> 23:30.856
Do not make us shoot you!

23:47.136 --> 23:48.602
Had to put him down.

23:51.580 --> 23:53.962
There goes our lead
on the other two shooters.

24:04.134 --> 24:05.707
Hey, honey, how are you feeling?

24:05.731 --> 24:06.753
I'm fine.

24:06.777 --> 24:09.589
Just worried about you.
This thing is all over the news.

24:09.613 --> 24:10.957
You know I can be right over there.

24:10.981 --> 24:13.093
Have you found the guys responsible yet?

24:14.061 --> 24:15.462
Not all of them.

24:15.486 --> 24:17.213
Well, then your team
needs you more than I do.

24:17.237 --> 24:19.099
Besides, the doctor
hasn't even induced yet,

24:19.123 --> 24:21.968
and as we remember
from the last two go-arounds,

24:21.992 --> 24:24.731
I was in 12 hours of labor each time.

24:24.755 --> 24:25.928
My mom's on her way

24:25.952 --> 24:28.775
to keep me company,
so you do what you got to do.

24:28.799 --> 24:30.703
I'll see you when you get done.

24:31.620 --> 24:33.146
I love you so much.

24:33.683 --> 24:35.127
Love you, too.

24:35.152 --> 24:36.351
I'll be there soon.

24:38.575 --> 24:40.820
Deacon, Luca and Tan
will lead this sector's search

24:40.844 --> 24:42.622
here for the other two shooters.

24:43.507 --> 24:46.404
A security camera at an ATM
on Romaine and La Brea

24:46.428 --> 24:48.723
caught two guys fitting
our witness's description

24:48.747 --> 24:50.580
going behind this auto body shop.

24:50.604 --> 24:51.965
And that's where we go blind.

24:51.989 --> 24:53.299
No security cameras beyond that point.

24:53.767 --> 24:55.686
Copy that, thanks.

24:57.020 --> 24:58.171
Captain, I just heard the ID

24:58.195 --> 24:59.839
on the second cop is Marc Walters.

24:59.863 --> 25:01.257
You knew him, too?

25:01.859 --> 25:04.094
Anything special
about Walters and Schwartz?

25:05.571 --> 25:07.364
They were on the same Street Crime Unit

25:07.388 --> 25:08.982
I worked back in Glassell Park.

25:09.006 --> 25:10.817
They were hotshots.
The commander in their division

25:10.841 --> 25:13.937
loved them, they were making
arrests, so everyone was happy.

25:14.663 --> 25:16.523
But you looked at it differently.

25:16.547 --> 25:18.691
Cards up, uh,

25:18.715 --> 25:21.494
I was casually dating a member
of the team at the time.

25:22.379 --> 25:24.030
There would be
a big takedown of a dealer,

25:24.054 --> 25:26.282
and suddenly, my boyfriend
would be sitting on some cash.

25:26.306 --> 25:28.168
He would talk about
bringing me in on something,

25:28.192 --> 25:30.203
but I got a bad vibe about it all.

25:30.227 --> 25:32.539
I broke up with him
and transferred out of there.

25:32.563 --> 25:34.340
Well, it sounds like you did
the right thing.

25:34.364 --> 25:36.376
I had a sense they were
all up to something,

25:36.400 --> 25:38.044
but each of them outranked me.

25:38.395 --> 25:40.526
I had no proof, and the
commander, you know,

25:40.550 --> 25:42.584
he could've made it really
hard for me if I came forward.

25:42.609 --> 25:44.684
You were a woman
trying to make your career.

25:44.708 --> 25:46.886
And it's not like you had
any intel to go to IA with.

25:46.910 --> 25:49.522
Wasn't your job to police them.

25:49.546 --> 25:52.892
At the time, my instinct was
just to get away from it.

25:53.285 --> 25:56.330
But I can't help feeling like
I should've come forward then,

25:57.498 --> 25:59.232
'cause maybe I could've
stopped all of this.

25:59.256 --> 26:00.900
So you think these shooters are targeting

26:00.924 --> 26:02.457
the old Street Crime Unit.

26:02.481 --> 26:04.571
The other two guys, David
Wong and Clark Thompson,

26:04.595 --> 26:06.406
I've got outdated contacts for them.

26:06.430 --> 26:08.708
I can't raise either one, but...

26:08.732 --> 26:11.211
...what if one of them's next?

26:11.235 --> 26:12.429
We'll scoop them up.

26:32.923 --> 26:35.018
David Wong, it's LAPD.

26:35.042 --> 26:36.625
Please open the door.

26:38.747 --> 26:40.428
Uh, be right there!

26:49.132 --> 26:50.867
Whoa, SWAT. Hey.

26:50.891 --> 26:53.286
- Officer Wong, are you home alone?
- Yeah, yeah, I'm alone.

26:53.310 --> 26:54.504
- Thanks for coming.
- Listen, we've got reason

26:54.528 --> 26:56.122
to believe that your life is in danger.

26:56.146 --> 26:57.757
So we're gonna escort you
to Metro headquarters.

26:57.781 --> 27:00.482
All right. Uh, yeah, come in.
Let me get my stuff.

27:03.954 --> 27:05.965
Luca, Tan, we're Code 4.

27:06.441 --> 27:08.885
30-David to Command, Wong is secure.

27:08.909 --> 27:10.637
26-David to Command,

27:10.661 --> 27:12.661
we're just rolling up
on Thompson's place.

27:18.418 --> 27:19.646
Door.

27:19.670 --> 27:21.419
Go, go, go.

27:29.012 --> 27:31.241
Clark Thompson?

27:31.265 --> 27:33.848
LAPD. Are you home?

27:45.439 --> 27:48.007
This is LAPD Chris Alonso!

27:48.031 --> 27:49.693
Clark, can you hear us?

27:58.342 --> 28:00.320
26-David to Command.

28:00.704 --> 28:03.332
No sign of Thompson.
House looks broken into.

28:05.626 --> 28:07.443
Phone got left behind.

28:07.467 --> 28:10.113
We know he didn't report to his
division at shift an hour ago.

28:10.756 --> 28:12.665
So he's officially missing.

28:13.142 --> 28:14.175
Chris.

28:17.477 --> 28:18.977
You think our killers got to him?

28:30.680 --> 28:31.805
We've got a patrol unit

28:31.830 --> 28:34.179
staked outside your place,
keeping an eye on it

28:34.203 --> 28:36.043
- in case the shooters come by.
- Thank you.

28:36.044 --> 28:37.438
- Appreciate it, guys.
- Did you know

28:37.462 --> 28:38.856
that two of your former
colleagues were killed today?

28:38.880 --> 28:40.157
Heard about Schwartz earlier,

28:40.181 --> 28:42.162
then about Walters just
before you guys showed up.

28:42.186 --> 28:44.125
Have you reached out to the
fourth member of your old crew,

28:44.150 --> 28:44.995
Clark Thompson?

28:45.019 --> 28:46.947
I tried to call him,
but couldn't get him.

28:46.971 --> 28:48.699
Any idea what this is about?

28:48.723 --> 28:50.668
When I was working
Glassell Park with you,

28:50.692 --> 28:52.169
I got a sense that with Thompson,

28:52.193 --> 28:54.004
maybe things weren't always aboveboard.

28:54.383 --> 28:57.458
Could something he did have
triggered these attacks today?

28:57.482 --> 29:00.544
No. No way. We made a lot of good busts.

29:00.568 --> 29:02.002
Not everyone might have
looked at them that way.

29:02.026 --> 29:03.681
Seems like Thompson's
been living pretty well.

29:03.705 --> 29:05.349
Especially for a guy
on a detective's salary.

29:05.373 --> 29:06.884
He runs a PI firm on the side.

29:06.908 --> 29:08.219
Consults here and there, I heard.

29:08.243 --> 29:10.521
I saw up-close how he ran that SCU.

29:10.545 --> 29:13.435
Singlehandedly set a record
for arrests in Glassell Park.

29:13.459 --> 29:15.726
Do you think it's possible
that he jammed up a few people

29:15.750 --> 29:17.728
- who didn't deserve it?
- Come on, guys.

29:17.752 --> 29:19.396
When you're effective,
you make a bunch of dirtbags

29:19.420 --> 29:20.898
and their pals unhappy.

29:20.922 --> 29:22.149
I'm sure someone started
spreading the word

29:22.173 --> 29:23.992
that we did this or we did that,

29:24.022 --> 29:26.068
'cause they wanted nothing
more than getting us off our beat.

29:26.092 --> 29:27.488
I mean, just look
what happened to that part

29:27.512 --> 29:30.074
- of town after we left.
- You had an impressive record.

29:30.098 --> 29:32.376
Some might say too impressive.

29:33.004 --> 29:34.545
Look.

29:34.569 --> 29:36.747
If I knew something
that could stop people

29:36.771 --> 29:40.439
from coming to kill me,
believe me, I'd tell you.

29:42.764 --> 29:44.388
Captain.

29:44.412 --> 29:46.279
Got a possible ID on one of our shooters.

29:56.958 --> 29:58.435
If Chris is right
about Wong and Thompson,

29:58.459 --> 30:00.404
I got a bad feeling
this could blow up even bigger.

30:00.428 --> 30:02.273
After everything we've
done to improve relations

30:02.297 --> 30:03.774
between the police and the community,

30:03.798 --> 30:04.942
this could set it all back.

30:04.966 --> 30:06.243
Ran the serial number

30:06.267 --> 30:07.945
of the revolver from our dead suspect.

30:07.969 --> 30:09.613
Came back as one of three stolen

30:09.637 --> 30:11.582
from a local fence out
of a Whittier pawn shop.

30:11.606 --> 30:14.118
Clerk cooperated, gave us
a positive ID on this guy.

30:14.142 --> 30:15.536
Hector Ledesma.

30:15.560 --> 30:17.751
Two priors for petty theft and burglary.

30:17.775 --> 30:19.290
Address is a house in Baldwin Hills.

30:19.314 --> 30:20.624
All right, I want a 500-foot perimeter

30:20.648 --> 30:21.907
around that house before we breach.

30:21.931 --> 30:22.982
I'll brief my guys.

30:29.290 --> 30:31.907
- Give me a two, give me a two!
- Two, two, two.

30:34.319 --> 30:36.130
Give me two!

30:37.110 --> 30:39.165
Chris. The basement.

30:48.009 --> 30:49.987
LAPD SWAT!

30:50.011 --> 30:52.823
Come to the bottom of the stairs
with your hands up!

30:52.847 --> 30:54.597
Hector Ledesma!

31:00.735 --> 31:02.666
- You're not Hector Ledesma.
- No.

31:02.690 --> 31:03.917
Hector's my son.

31:06.611 --> 31:08.172
Who did this to you?

31:08.196 --> 31:10.341
Officer Thompson. Clark Thompson.

31:10.365 --> 31:12.627
- He was here?
- He threatened to kill me

31:12.651 --> 31:14.645
if I didn't let him know
where Hector was hiding.

31:14.669 --> 31:16.597
- Then he left me for dead.
- So Thompson

31:16.621 --> 31:18.349
and his men did something
to your son, didn't they?

31:18.373 --> 31:20.317
Yeah, but not the son you're thinking of.

31:20.341 --> 31:22.519
- You want Hector.
- Yeah.

31:22.543 --> 31:24.521
But you should have
brought Javi back to me.

31:24.545 --> 31:26.357
- Who's Javi?
- My other son.

31:27.077 --> 31:29.860
He died in prison last week.

31:29.884 --> 31:32.029
- In a riot.
- What was he doing time for?

31:32.958 --> 31:34.365
You tell me.

31:34.876 --> 31:37.000
Thompson and his guys took him.

31:37.024 --> 31:39.002
They used my boy.

31:39.422 --> 31:41.705
He did nothing wrong, he was a good kid.

31:41.729 --> 31:45.542
Then they framed him, they
took his pot and sold it.

31:45.566 --> 31:47.211
It wasn't just my son this happened to.

31:47.235 --> 31:49.847
They jammed up a ton of kids
in this neighborhood.

31:49.871 --> 31:52.549
- When did this happen, then?
- Five, six years ago.

31:52.573 --> 31:54.017
He was innocent.

31:54.041 --> 31:55.886
He didn't deserve to go to jail.

31:55.910 --> 31:57.638
But you know what your other
son's been up to, right?

31:57.662 --> 31:59.056
Killing two cops?

31:59.080 --> 32:00.793
I couldn't stop him or his friends.

32:00.817 --> 32:02.559
But you could've come to the police.

32:03.363 --> 32:05.052
You have any kids, Officer?

32:05.076 --> 32:06.299
No. Not yet.

32:06.324 --> 32:08.399
Then you don't know what
it's like to lose one.

32:09.536 --> 32:12.069
Look, I get your pain,

32:12.093 --> 32:14.037
I get what these guys did
to your neighborhood,

32:14.061 --> 32:16.209
but this is not how you fix it.

32:17.098 --> 32:18.826
Where is your son and his friend hiding?

32:18.851 --> 32:19.910
I don't know.

32:19.934 --> 32:21.912
Thompson took my phone,
and he made me call Hector.

32:22.340 --> 32:24.081
That's the last thing I remember.

32:24.105 --> 32:25.416
So he could track Hector's signal,

32:25.440 --> 32:27.418
get a bead on the location
of their hideout.

32:27.442 --> 32:29.553
Look, you should've come to us,
okay? We could've helped you.

32:29.577 --> 32:31.110
I should trust cops?

32:35.270 --> 32:37.340
Come on. Get up.

32:37.364 --> 32:39.452
Hondo, we're coming up!

32:41.443 --> 32:43.600
Hey, what happened to Wong?

32:43.624 --> 32:45.519
Said he was going for a smoke
out in the motor pool.

32:45.543 --> 32:47.354
- When was this?
- Maybe a half hour ago?

32:47.824 --> 32:50.190
I was just in the motor pool
and he wasn't there.

32:50.214 --> 32:51.575
Nobody said I was supposed
to keep an eye on him.

32:51.599 --> 32:52.704
You weren't.

33:02.643 --> 33:04.922
Why'd you have me meet you here?

33:04.946 --> 33:07.980
Got some intel that paid off.

33:11.152 --> 33:14.047
The guys trying to kill us.

33:14.071 --> 33:15.215
What are you gonna do with them?

33:15.239 --> 33:16.967
We're gonna take them to my office.

33:16.991 --> 33:18.461
Make it look like they
were coming for us,

33:18.485 --> 33:20.523
but we got the drop on them first.

33:21.412 --> 33:23.128
Otherwise, everything's gonna come out.

33:29.287 --> 33:31.051
With our cops looking for
the shooters and the shooters

33:31.075 --> 33:32.811
looking for our cops, they're
on a collision course.

33:32.836 --> 33:34.280
Yeah, I'd hate to think what could happen

33:34.304 --> 33:35.948
in those neighborhoods if Wong
and Thompson get ahold of

33:35.972 --> 33:37.483
these guys and try to
cover up what they did.

33:37.507 --> 33:39.484
Okay, the last ping
from Wong's cell phone

33:39.508 --> 33:40.961
came from a freeway off-ramp

33:40.985 --> 33:42.521
in Canoga Park before the signal died.

33:42.562 --> 33:44.491
Probably destroyed the phone
before we could track him.

33:44.515 --> 33:46.375
We've already been
to Wong and Thompson's houses.

33:46.399 --> 33:47.793
Where else would the shooters go looking?

33:47.817 --> 33:49.044
They went after the first two cops

33:49.068 --> 33:50.212
while they were on their beat.

33:51.486 --> 33:53.715
Thompson's PI firm,
which is probably a front

33:53.739 --> 33:55.330
so he can launder money
and live in style.

33:55.355 --> 33:57.184
Guy had a choice. Went the wrong way.

33:57.208 --> 33:58.501
Yeah, so did his buddies. They thought

33:58.525 --> 34:00.052
they were above the law...
it's a good thing

34:00.076 --> 34:01.113
they never came to my neighborhood.

34:01.137 --> 34:02.560
The address for the PI firm

34:02.584 --> 34:04.206
is six blocks south of where

34:04.230 --> 34:06.175
Wong's cell signal died:
De Soto and Saticoy.

34:06.199 --> 34:08.226
- Check it out.
- We go in stealth.

34:14.123 --> 34:15.520
Let's go.

34:15.543 --> 34:17.603
Get up. Come on.

34:24.634 --> 34:25.694
Shut up.

34:25.717 --> 34:27.196
Dispatch.

34:27.219 --> 34:28.746
Dispatch, this is 20-Lincoln-30.

34:28.771 --> 34:30.187
Went by my off-duty place of work.

34:30.210 --> 34:32.951
There's a break-in. 15821 Saticoy.

34:32.975 --> 34:34.620
Send backup.

34:34.643 --> 34:35.952
Roger, 20-Lincoln-30.

34:35.976 --> 34:37.385
1-1-4 is already on site.

34:37.409 --> 34:39.625
Negative, Dispatch.
This is not an open call.

34:39.649 --> 34:42.094
We're the only officers
currently at location.

34:42.118 --> 34:43.379
Standing by. Over.

34:43.402 --> 34:45.264
I repeat, 1-1-4 is on site.

34:45.288 --> 34:47.022
LAPD SWAT will advise at location.

34:47.045 --> 34:48.801
Dispatch, I didn't call it in yet.

34:48.824 --> 34:50.768
That's 'cause I did.
LAPD SWAT. Drop the gun.

34:50.793 --> 34:52.972
Both of you! Drop your guns now!

34:52.996 --> 34:54.473
Hey.

34:54.496 --> 34:55.996
You got it. The gun.

34:59.330 --> 35:01.614
We caught these guys
red-handed, all right?

35:01.638 --> 35:02.868
Trying to come in here and waylay me.

35:02.892 --> 35:04.733
Lucky my buddy Wong was here.

35:04.757 --> 35:05.867
We took 'em down.

35:05.891 --> 35:08.454
- Yeah, we were just calling it in.
- Nice try, guys.

35:08.478 --> 35:09.699
Hey, Chris.

35:09.723 --> 35:11.123
Good to see you.

35:11.147 --> 35:13.648
Damn, you look fly in full tac.

35:15.430 --> 35:16.415
Been a long time.

35:16.439 --> 35:18.986
Not long enough. I know what you did.

35:21.274 --> 35:23.556
- What did I do?
- You jammed up innocent people.

35:24.122 --> 35:25.804
Like his brother.

35:25.828 --> 35:27.644
His brother was a junkie,

35:27.668 --> 35:28.858
not some innocent.

35:28.882 --> 35:30.450
He had no priors. Just a pothead.

35:30.474 --> 35:33.429
- Don't defend these lowlifes, Chris.
- And the legit busts?

35:33.453 --> 35:36.015
You palmed the goods
and sold 'em off to, uh,

35:36.039 --> 35:37.349
float your lifestyle.

35:37.373 --> 35:38.940
Just wait a second. Hold on. Guys.

35:38.964 --> 35:40.189
We're all on the same team here, right?

35:40.214 --> 35:41.210
Hell no, we're not.

35:41.234 --> 35:43.729
His brother died in the pen
because of you.

35:43.753 --> 35:45.376
Hey, Chris, come on.

35:46.382 --> 35:49.695
- You know me.
- Yeah, deep down I did know you.

35:49.719 --> 35:51.547
I should have done something
about it six years ago.

35:51.572 --> 35:52.577
All clear.

35:56.660 --> 35:58.370
Turn around. Turn around.

35:58.394 --> 35:59.705
Hands behind your back.

35:59.729 --> 36:01.373
You're both under arrest for the murders

36:01.397 --> 36:03.197
of Officers Pete Schwartz
and Marc Walters.

36:36.432 --> 36:37.720
You okay?

36:38.234 --> 36:39.912
Yeah, it's just

36:39.936 --> 36:41.880
this job is hard enough
as it is, and even harder

36:41.904 --> 36:44.249
when you got a few bad apples
in your own ranks, you know?

36:44.273 --> 36:47.002
There's a lot more of us
than there are of them.

36:47.026 --> 36:49.004
But they were protected along the way,

36:49.028 --> 36:51.757
or turned a blind eye to, even by me.

36:52.277 --> 36:54.426
I was in the Crime Unit six years ago

36:54.450 --> 36:56.011
when I started dating Thompson.

36:56.035 --> 36:57.930
He was this...

36:57.954 --> 37:02.017
hotshot cop, and I guess
I was, um... impressed.

37:02.453 --> 37:04.236
Like everyone else,
I didn't think too much

37:04.260 --> 37:05.938
about how he was getting it done.

37:05.962 --> 37:07.439
I...

37:07.463 --> 37:09.942
- I could have stopped all of this.
- No.

37:09.966 --> 37:11.966
You're being way too tough on yourself.

37:20.276 --> 37:22.943
He's the reason I don't date cops.

37:34.457 --> 37:37.970
Anesthesiology
to OR Three for emergency surgery.

37:37.994 --> 37:39.410
Anesthesiology to OR Three
for emergency surgery.

37:41.818 --> 37:44.096
- This'll all be over really soon, okay?
- Okay.

37:44.121 --> 37:45.131
What's happening?

37:45.334 --> 37:46.945
She has a placental abruption.

37:46.969 --> 37:48.480
We're prepping
for an emergency C-section.

37:48.504 --> 37:50.282
- Why didn't you call me?
- 'Cause I

37:50.306 --> 37:52.985
didn't want to worry you,
again. I'm gonna be okay.

37:53.009 --> 37:55.465
- And the baby?
- We'll know soon.

38:01.846 --> 38:02.779
Bonnie.

38:02.803 --> 38:04.747
Hey. Hey.

38:05.350 --> 38:06.386
How you doing?

38:06.387 --> 38:07.477
Good.

38:08.101 --> 38:10.579
I should've texted, I know, I just...

38:10.604 --> 38:13.033
I really needed to see your face
after everything today.

38:13.144 --> 38:15.506
How's Annie doing? Is she in labor yet?

38:15.530 --> 38:16.707
I think everything's on track.

38:16.731 --> 38:18.792
Mm. You got that for the baby?

38:18.816 --> 38:20.127
Oh, no, I got him for you.

38:20.151 --> 38:21.712
Or, um, maybe it's a her.

38:21.736 --> 38:23.797
I don't know. Are these
things, uh, asexual?

38:25.990 --> 38:28.135
I know, teddy bear's a lousy gift, um...

38:28.159 --> 38:30.554
you were probably expecting
something more meaningful...

38:30.958 --> 38:32.556
significant...

38:32.580 --> 38:34.024
permanent.

38:36.551 --> 38:38.729
You mean like an engagement ring?

38:38.753 --> 38:41.532
I don't know. Maybe?

38:41.556 --> 38:43.150
Were you expecting such a thing?

38:43.174 --> 38:44.568
- Unbelievable.
- What?

38:44.592 --> 38:46.537
I think your friends are messing with us.

38:46.561 --> 38:48.489
- Who, Luca?
- And Street.

38:48.513 --> 38:50.491
I've been getting
all of these weird texts

38:50.515 --> 38:51.658
from the two of them,

38:51.682 --> 38:53.243
asking all of these theoreticals

38:53.267 --> 38:55.356
about how serious we were getting.

38:55.380 --> 38:56.469
They've been telling me

38:56.493 --> 38:57.915
you thought I was gonna propose tonight.

38:57.939 --> 38:59.383
Wh... No.

38:59.407 --> 39:01.585
That was totally taken out of context.

39:01.609 --> 39:04.087
I just said that's the kind of thing

39:04.111 --> 39:06.089
a lot of people do on Valentine's Day.

39:07.698 --> 39:09.760
I'm lucky you're not like
a lot of people.

39:10.841 --> 39:11.814
Yeah, I guess maybe

39:11.838 --> 39:13.430
***

39:13.454 --> 39:14.431
Like they think...

39:14.455 --> 39:15.899
We should end up together.

39:15.923 --> 39:17.267
Eh, could be worse.

39:17.291 --> 39:18.268
Your friends could hate me.

39:18.292 --> 39:19.736
- Who could hate you?
- Hmm.

39:19.760 --> 39:22.072
Trust me, I've made
a few enemies in my time.

39:22.096 --> 39:23.357
Oh, yeah? Well, let's see
'em try and get through me.

39:24.382 --> 39:25.776
My hero.

39:27.398 --> 39:29.530
Well, thank God that's settled.

39:30.268 --> 39:33.617
To be honest, Luca had me
high-key terrified

39:33.641 --> 39:35.202
that you were gonna
pop the question tonight.

39:35.226 --> 39:36.587
Wait. Terrified?

39:36.611 --> 39:38.121
I've got my period

39:38.145 --> 39:40.090
and I'm, like, so bloated I
feel completely unattractive.

39:40.114 --> 39:41.919
Oh, please. You look amazing.

39:41.943 --> 39:44.127
And a woman should feel beautiful

39:44.151 --> 39:45.825
when someone proposes to her.

39:46.621 --> 39:48.737
Uh...

39:49.957 --> 39:51.385
Oh, no. What?

39:51.409 --> 39:53.437
Annie's having some kind of
complication with the birth.

39:53.461 --> 39:54.888
Hondo's getting the team
together at the hospital.

39:54.912 --> 39:56.190
- Okay, go.
- Yeah.

39:56.214 --> 39:57.307
- Text me what's happening.
- I will.

39:57.331 --> 39:58.308
- Hey.
- Yeah?

39:58.332 --> 39:59.643
Leave the bear.

39:59.667 --> 40:01.834
He's totally punk rock and he's all mine.

40:11.798 --> 40:13.853
You know I totally want
to end up with you, right?

40:14.849 --> 40:16.460
I know.

40:16.484 --> 40:18.441
Maybe you'll even deserve me.

40:22.857 --> 40:26.225
Waiting really isn't my strong suit.

40:26.249 --> 40:27.254
Aw, come on, now.

40:27.278 --> 40:29.172
Annie's tough... she's gonna
pull through for both of them.

40:29.196 --> 40:30.307
Hey, you still got some time, man.

40:30.331 --> 40:31.975
Fix that gift situation with your girl.

40:31.999 --> 40:34.011
Uh, for your information,
she loved the teddy bear

40:34.035 --> 40:36.813
and despite your best attempts
to trick Bonnie and me

40:36.837 --> 40:38.015
into getting engaged,

40:38.039 --> 40:39.349
we're gonna move at our own speed.

40:39.373 --> 40:41.332
Plus, I booked us a trip
to wine country next week.

40:41.356 --> 40:43.405
Not bad. Way to score some
points at the last minute.

40:43.429 --> 40:45.439
You think so? I was worried
it might come off as desperate.

40:45.463 --> 40:47.274
Nah. Hitting a singles bar
with a colleague

40:47.298 --> 40:49.026
on Valentine's Day is desperate.

40:49.050 --> 40:51.528
Tactical. Whatever you say, man.

41:00.645 --> 41:01.955
Hey.

41:01.979 --> 41:03.236
Deac.

41:04.487 --> 41:05.792
What's the word?

41:06.405 --> 41:08.378
Her name is Victoria Josie Kay.

41:08.402 --> 41:10.213
She's eight pounds four ounces,

41:10.237 --> 41:11.298
and she's fine, and Annie's fine.

41:11.322 --> 41:13.133
- Baby girl in the building!
- Yeah!

41:13.157 --> 41:14.693
- Congratulations.
- I want her to meet her new family.

41:14.718 --> 41:15.686
Come on.

41:15.710 --> 41:16.853
- Congratulations.
- And her new godmother.
