NETFLIX PRESENTS

00:43.627 --> 00:46.797
Do you realize I'm the only one
of my friends who's still single?

00:47.798 --> 00:48.757
You're not single.

00:48.840 --> 00:52.094
-You know what I mean, Gabriel.
-Ana, it's not a good time.

00:53.095 --> 00:56.098
You said you'd give me
a ring nine months ago.

00:56.348 --> 00:58.892
-What matters is that we're together.
-Set a date!

01:00.894 --> 01:02.312
When am I getting my ring?

01:02.396 --> 01:04.231
-Don't say "soon."
-Soon.

01:06.441 --> 01:07.943
If you can't set a date,

01:08.527 --> 01:10.279
we shouldn't be together.

01:11.738 --> 01:12.656
You're right.

01:13.198 --> 01:14.241
Seriously?

01:15.367 --> 01:16.326
Yes.

01:16.410 --> 01:17.869
We should break up.

01:22.499 --> 01:23.584
What?

01:23.834 --> 01:26.920
I don't want to waste your time.
I don't want to get married.

01:33.176 --> 01:35.178
You know what? Forget what I said.

01:35.721 --> 01:38.473
-Forget it.
-I can't give you what you want.

01:38.557 --> 01:41.727
No, Gabriel. We can't break up.

01:43.812 --> 01:46.148
-Calm down.
-Please don't do this to me.

01:46.356 --> 01:48.942
If you don't calm down,
I'm going to have to leave.

01:49.318 --> 01:52.154
Look, I won't pressure you anymore.
No more wedding talk.

01:52.237 --> 01:55.866
-It's not just that.
-I can be more spontaneous.

01:55.949 --> 01:58.660
We can try new things.
In fact, if you want, I can...

02:02.039 --> 02:05.542
I'll do anything you want.
Just tell me and I'll do it.

02:05.626 --> 02:07.127
-I'm leaving.
-I'll do it!

02:07.210 --> 02:09.087
But please don't leave me!

02:09.379 --> 02:12.466
-This is ridiculous. I'm leaving.
-Gabriel, where are you going?

02:12.549 --> 02:14.468
No.

02:17.929 --> 02:20.098
Don't leave, Gabriel!

02:21.308 --> 02:24.645
No!

02:40.160 --> 02:43.121
-Is that your sister's car?
-Yes. What's she doing?

02:43.747 --> 02:45.290
Hey!

02:45.832 --> 02:46.792
Damn it!

02:48.919 --> 02:52.297
-Where are you going?
-Thanks to you, I just crashed my car.

02:52.381 --> 02:56.051
-About twenty times, right?
-Nothing happened to it.

02:56.134 --> 02:58.178
Are you coming in?
Mom and Dad are waiting.

02:59.221 --> 03:00.222
Ana.

03:00.972 --> 03:02.557
Seriously. I've had enough.

03:02.641 --> 03:05.143
-What's she doing?
-I don't know. Let's go in.

03:23.662 --> 03:26.081
-Hi, Dad. Happy Anniversary.
-Hi, sweetie.

03:26.581 --> 03:28.875
Thank you! Do you remember <i>Huevo?</i>

03:29.918 --> 03:32.337
Didn't we meet at her wedding
about three years ago?

03:32.421 --> 03:36.091
No, that was Julia. Ana is making us wait.

03:37.509 --> 03:38.969
I'm going to eat something.

03:49.521 --> 03:51.273
Love, wait you can't eat that.

03:53.275 --> 03:55.026
Can I have some<i> paella?</i>

03:55.110 --> 03:58.029
I don't like seafood and greens.
Can you take all that out?

03:58.488 --> 04:00.699
-Do you want just rice?
-Yes.

04:00.866 --> 04:01.950
That's not possible.

04:04.035 --> 04:06.872
How's everything?
Are you back with Gabriel?

04:06.955 --> 04:10.167
No, I'm giving him some time
to realize what he's lost.

04:10.250 --> 04:12.252
Six months isn't enough?

04:12.419 --> 04:15.922
What beautiful girls.
Just like their mother!

04:16.006 --> 04:18.008
-It's so nice of you to say so!
-Thanks.

04:18.091 --> 04:19.885
-Congratulations.
-Oh, sweetie!

04:19.968 --> 04:21.678
Thank you, dear.

04:24.139 --> 04:26.308
Congratulations, Mari.
We brought you something.

04:26.391 --> 04:28.310
You can exchange it if you don't like it.

04:28.935 --> 04:31.146
No way! It's from my favorite store!

04:31.688 --> 04:35.609
So, where's that handsome boyfriend
of yours?

04:41.072 --> 04:42.115
Is something wrong?

04:44.034 --> 04:46.703
It's just that Gabriel broke up with Ana.

04:47.329 --> 04:49.456
Well, actually...

04:50.540 --> 04:51.750
I broke up with him.

04:51.833 --> 04:54.002
Well, practically, he dumped you,
didn't he?

04:55.170 --> 04:56.755
Weren't you going to get married?

04:56.838 --> 05:01.426
You never know. A friend of mine
got engaged after a seven-year break-up.

05:01.510 --> 05:05.096
And now she's happily married.
It's all she talks about.

05:05.180 --> 05:08.558
Poor Ana, so unlucky!
She just can't find a husband.

05:08.642 --> 05:10.894
-And she's cute.
-I know.

05:11.269 --> 05:12.896
It's a bit late to meet someone.

05:12.979 --> 05:15.565
-Well, it's not the 20th century anymore.
-She's right.

05:15.649 --> 05:18.902
Some people don't get married.
Like Tamara, for example.

05:18.985 --> 05:20.570
-Tamara!
-What?

05:20.654 --> 05:22.781
You haven't told them
about my Tammy?

05:24.658 --> 05:26.785
We were having dinner
at a Japanese restaurant.

05:26.868 --> 05:29.204
I knew something was up.
But I never imagined

05:29.287 --> 05:32.999
that my ring would be inside
a fortune cookie!

05:33.208 --> 05:36.920
In front of everyone,
Benny knelt down and said,

05:37.337 --> 05:40.423
<i>"Omae to kekkon shitai."</i>

05:42.342 --> 05:44.761
It means, "Will you marry me?"
in Japanese.

05:44.928 --> 05:47.180
Isn't that incredible?
I'm getting married!

05:47.264 --> 05:49.808
-Incredible? Not really.
-It's really cool.

05:49.891 --> 05:52.060
And so original, in Japanese.

05:52.894 --> 05:55.730
So, where is this dreamy Benny?

05:56.565 --> 05:58.191
I don't see him anywhere.

05:58.775 --> 05:59.609
Babe!

06:00.151 --> 06:01.570
Come meet my cousins.

06:04.656 --> 06:05.490
Hello.

06:13.331 --> 06:14.207
What's up?

06:22.716 --> 06:25.093
-How did you do it?
-How did I do what?

06:26.678 --> 06:31.641
I was with Gabriel for ten years
and you got engaged in three months.

06:31.892 --> 06:33.059
Are you drunk?

06:34.144 --> 06:35.604
Tell me your secret.

06:36.229 --> 06:38.481
How did you get him to give you a ring?

06:38.565 --> 06:41.526
There's no secret.
We fell in love, that's all.

06:43.194 --> 06:44.863
You're not fooling me.

06:45.322 --> 06:47.824
There's something fishy going on here.

06:49.200 --> 06:51.369
I'm way prettier than you.

06:51.870 --> 06:53.788
How did you do it? How!

06:55.206 --> 06:56.750
Okay, you got me.

06:58.001 --> 06:59.127
I took a workshop.

07:04.382 --> 07:05.842
What do you mean, a workshop?

07:06.718 --> 07:09.054
A workshop on how to find a husband.

07:13.308 --> 07:17.187
That's pathetic.
You really outdid yourself this time.

07:17.270 --> 07:18.188
You know what?

07:19.314 --> 07:21.066
Being alone will do you good!

07:29.532 --> 07:33.453
Today we're celebrating 35 years together.

07:33.662 --> 07:37.415
Damn, just saying it out loud
sounds crazy.

07:37.791 --> 07:40.669
I still don't understand
how she convinced me.

07:41.127 --> 07:44.839
Maybe it was because she baked
such wonderful brownies.

07:45.298 --> 07:48.802
In the end, my Mari caught me.

07:49.636 --> 07:55.350
Before I knew it,
we were married and had two lovely girls.

07:55.767 --> 07:57.936
Wild haired and feisty!

07:58.269 --> 08:00.605
-Especially feisty. A little.
-Not true.

08:00.689 --> 08:04.985
Thank you so much for celebrating
our anniversary with us.

08:05.360 --> 08:06.444
Cheers, my love!

08:07.362 --> 08:09.030
-Cheers.
-Thank you.

08:09.364 --> 08:12.075
Thank you for everything,
for giving me so much.

08:14.869 --> 08:16.329
-Bravo!
-Bravo!

08:16.496 --> 08:20.250
I don't have much to add
to my husband's long speech.

08:20.333 --> 08:23.128
But there is something
I want to tell all of you.

08:23.294 --> 08:26.506
I've never baked brownies in my life!

08:27.382 --> 08:29.134
Thank you for coming.

08:29.509 --> 08:31.594
Can I borrow that?
I want to say a few words.

08:32.971 --> 08:37.600
I just want to congratulate you
for staying together so long.

08:37.684 --> 08:39.227
-Thanks, sweetie..
-Thank you.

08:40.562 --> 08:44.774
It's hard to find someone who wants
to spend their whole life with you.

08:45.066 --> 08:47.277
-Especially nowadays.
-I think that's enough.

08:47.569 --> 08:49.821
I'm not done, Mom. I'm not done yet.

08:49.904 --> 08:52.949
-What's she on?
-My point is, life is unfair.

08:53.033 --> 08:55.577
One day, you're about to get married.

08:55.660 --> 08:57.746
And the next,
you're at your parents' house,

08:57.829 --> 09:00.749
congratulating your loser cousin

09:01.416 --> 09:03.168
on her engagement.

09:04.461 --> 09:07.005
-Sorry. Someone had to say it.
-Anita.

09:07.589 --> 09:11.051
No, I have something to say.
I want to say something!

09:11.217 --> 09:12.260
That's the way it is.

09:12.343 --> 09:15.055
In life, if you want it,<i></i>
you can't have it.

09:15.138 --> 09:18.141
If you don't want it, you get it.
And that's that.

09:18.224 --> 09:22.228
But not everything is lost.
I still hope to find someone.

09:22.312 --> 09:26.900
If you want to help me,
please dial 5540-3242.

09:26.983 --> 09:28.276
That's enough!

09:34.032 --> 09:36.034
-Lovely speech.
-Thank you.

09:36.951 --> 09:37.786
Cheers!

09:37.994 --> 09:41.956
It's ruined! The party is ruined. Ruined!

09:42.415 --> 09:46.336
Don't worry. Just go to bed.
We'll talk about it tomorrow.

09:46.544 --> 09:50.006
It's all because of
that fucking ugly Tamara.

09:54.385 --> 09:57.055
Why didn't he want to marry me, Julia?

09:57.138 --> 10:00.809
Because he's an asshole, Ana.
He did you a favor.

10:01.142 --> 10:05.230
-Forget about him.
-But he's so handsome.

10:05.730 --> 10:08.108
You haven't seen him
without a shirt. Really.

10:08.191 --> 10:11.111
Please, we'll talk tomorrow.
Please get in the car!

10:11.903 --> 10:13.780
-What do I do?
-Just let her go.

10:13.988 --> 10:16.116
-Not that one, Ana!
-Not that one!

10:16.199 --> 10:17.450
-What the fuck?
-No!

10:17.534 --> 10:20.870
-Wait. What's up with you?
-It's this one.

10:21.704 --> 10:24.999
-Should we give her some club soda?
-We're not giving her anything.

10:25.083 --> 10:28.753
-Why not?
-Because you hate club soda!

10:29.170 --> 10:32.382
-Honey, she might puke in the taxi.
-She won't. You won't, right?

10:32.549 --> 10:35.552
-What?
-Hush, just watch your head.

10:35.844 --> 10:38.096
-Why are you laughing at me?
-He's not laughing.

10:38.263 --> 10:40.223
-I saw him!
-No, he's not laughing.

10:40.306 --> 10:41.641
I'm not laughing, Ana.

10:41.724 --> 10:44.352
He's not laughing.
No one is laughing at you.

10:44.978 --> 10:47.480
-Settle down.
-Don't worry. She's fine.

10:48.231 --> 10:51.943
-I love him!
-Yes, I know.

10:52.026 --> 10:55.363
But you'll get over him. Watch your feet.

10:55.446 --> 10:57.574
Honey, pull down her skirt.

10:58.825 --> 11:01.286
Watch your feet.
Let me know when you get there.

11:03.246 --> 11:05.123
-Are you sure she's okay?
-Gabriel.

11:05.456 --> 11:06.416
I don't know.

11:37.363 --> 11:39.866
Gabriel!

11:52.128 --> 11:52.962
Gabo?

11:57.091 --> 11:57.926
Gabo!

12:12.232 --> 12:13.691
Gabriel!

12:23.868 --> 12:24.786
Surprise!

12:26.788 --> 12:27.622
Cheers!

12:29.832 --> 12:30.959
What the fuck?

12:31.876 --> 12:32.752
Ana...

12:33.127 --> 12:33.962
what are you--

12:35.129 --> 12:36.047
What are you doing?

12:36.130 --> 12:38.925
I thought you were alone.
It was a surprise.

12:40.927 --> 12:41.928
Ana, wait!

12:42.929 --> 12:44.305
I'll be right back.

12:45.682 --> 12:46.599
Gabriel?

12:48.434 --> 12:50.144
What the hell is going on?

12:50.728 --> 12:51.854
Who's this?

12:52.814 --> 12:56.401
-Remember Ingrid, from work?
-Ana, Gabriel and I are engaged.

12:58.945 --> 13:01.823
-What?
-I never found the right time to tell you.

13:02.865 --> 13:04.200
You're joking, right?

13:05.660 --> 13:07.245
I don't get it. We just broke up.

13:07.578 --> 13:09.414
Honestly, your relationship was over.

13:09.497 --> 13:11.708
-Shut up, fucking whore.
-Ana!

13:12.500 --> 13:15.044
Gabriel, my parents are waiting for us.

13:16.045 --> 13:18.631
You said that she was your friend.

13:18.840 --> 13:20.425
That she had bad breath.

13:20.508 --> 13:22.593
-That she was annoying.
-Listen.

13:22.885 --> 13:25.263
We don't choose the person
we fall in love with.

13:34.731 --> 13:35.940
I'm going.

13:39.777 --> 13:41.195
I'm leaving.

13:53.624 --> 13:56.169
You said you weren't ready
to get married.

13:56.627 --> 13:57.628
To you.

14:12.727 --> 14:15.563
I hope you get run over
outside the church.

15:38.729 --> 15:43.860
GABRIEL ORDOÑEZ IS ENGAGED
TO INGRID AVENDAÑO

16:02.670 --> 16:04.088
-Hello.
-Tamara?

16:04.380 --> 16:05.256
What?

16:05.673 --> 16:06.507
Hi.

16:06.924 --> 16:07.842
What do you want?

16:07.925 --> 16:10.887
I need you to send me the info
about the workshop you took.

16:11.762 --> 16:13.764
I thought you said it was pathetic.

16:14.557 --> 16:17.935
-It's not for me. It's for a friend.
-Ana, I saw Gabriel's Facebook.

16:20.396 --> 16:22.815
I shouldn't help you
because of the way you treat me.

16:23.232 --> 16:25.234
<i>But I think you need it.</i>

16:25.693 --> 16:28.362
Call them.
It will save you a lot of dates.

16:29.071 --> 16:30.364
<i>Tell them I referred you.</i>

16:30.865 --> 16:32.867
<i>I got along great with the teacher.</i>

16:33.034 --> 16:34.827
<i>The school has good karma.</i>

16:36.120 --> 16:37.330
<i>Did you get it? Ana?</i>

16:37.413 --> 16:39.332
ARE YOU TIRED
OF GOING ON BAD DATES?

16:39.415 --> 16:41.167
IS YOUR BIOLOGICAL
CLOCK TICKING AWAY?

16:41.918 --> 16:42.793
<i>Ana?</i>

16:43.002 --> 16:43.836
<i>Fuckin' Ana.</i>

17:11.697 --> 17:12.823
-Go ahead.
-Thank you.

17:12.990 --> 17:14.200
You're welcome.

17:16.619 --> 17:17.787
Hi, princess!

17:19.121 --> 17:20.289
Can I help you?

17:27.713 --> 17:29.924
-Hi.
-What's your name?

17:31.217 --> 17:32.051
Ana Mendoza.

17:36.973 --> 17:38.599
Here's your welcome kit.

17:42.645 --> 17:44.897
HELLO! MY NAME IS:
ANA.

17:45.147 --> 17:46.023
Thanks.

17:48.025 --> 17:49.569
Isn't this nerve-racking?

17:53.990 --> 17:55.199
Hi. I'm Ema.

17:56.492 --> 17:57.326
Sandra.

17:58.661 --> 17:59.954
You look familiar.

18:00.788 --> 18:03.666
Didn't I see you
in the "Master your sexual self" workshop?

18:04.625 --> 18:06.168
This is my first workshop.

18:07.128 --> 18:08.588
Yeah, mine too.

18:14.468 --> 18:16.846
Never jump into a lake
if you're wasted.

18:17.471 --> 18:21.058
-Do you think we'll find a husband?
-I hope so.

18:21.225 --> 18:23.603
More than anything,
I really hate wasting my time.

18:23.769 --> 18:27.398
One of my friends took the course
and married a millionaire in six months.

18:27.481 --> 18:29.775
She doesn't have to pay rent anymore

18:29.859 --> 18:32.737
or date creepy old dudes
because she feels past her prime.

18:35.531 --> 18:38.743
So, all of you are on a journey
to find a man.

18:43.664 --> 18:45.499
And what have you done to find him?

18:51.255 --> 18:53.924
I signed up for a workshop
to find a husband!

18:55.676 --> 18:57.887
Well, my aunt paid for it.

18:59.388 --> 19:02.350
Well, I downloaded Tinder...

19:02.975 --> 19:05.603
and other apps,
but no one takes you seriously.

19:05.770 --> 19:08.439
Maybe you're the ones
who don't take yourselves seriously.

19:10.608 --> 19:12.610
How many failed dates
have you been on?

19:14.195 --> 19:18.491
How many times have you waited
for that phone call that never came?

19:20.826 --> 19:22.370
No need to answer.

19:22.787 --> 19:23.704
I can imagine.

19:24.622 --> 19:26.290
We live in hard times.

19:27.333 --> 19:31.212
Technology allows us to find
a partner with one simple click.

19:31.462 --> 19:32.588
And with another...

19:33.214 --> 19:34.590
we can get rid of them.

19:35.800 --> 19:39.303
Men have more options
to choose from nowadays.

19:40.179 --> 19:41.097
But...

19:41.931 --> 19:42.932
so do we.

19:44.809 --> 19:46.060
My name is Lucila.

19:46.727 --> 19:51.357
In this course you'll learn
all the secrets for getting a husband.

19:57.863 --> 19:59.365
Did I say something funny?

20:01.367 --> 20:04.870
No. I think this workshop
isn't right for me.

20:05.204 --> 20:06.288
I'm leaving.

20:07.081 --> 20:08.416
Fine. Leave.

20:08.708 --> 20:15.005
Go back to your boring, miserable life
while everyone around you gets married.

20:15.506 --> 20:17.007
My life isn't boring.

20:26.517 --> 20:28.978
"Go back to your boring, miserable life."

20:29.979 --> 20:31.522
Your face is miserable.

20:32.523 --> 20:35.276
<i>I can't answer</i>
<i>because I'm planning my wedding!</i>

20:35.443 --> 20:36.736
<i>Please leave your message.</i>

20:36.944 --> 20:40.573
You're too much, Tamara. Too fucking much!

20:40.990 --> 20:45.327
That workshop was full of desperate women,
and I'm not desperate.

20:47.621 --> 20:48.664
Oh, shit.

20:55.504 --> 20:59.049
I've got to go now. I'm running late
and I have a lot to do.

20:59.842 --> 21:01.177
Why the bad mood? What's up?

21:03.262 --> 21:05.181
You could've said
you didn't want to help.

21:05.264 --> 21:07.391
What would you have done?
You have no money.

21:07.767 --> 21:10.770
Why are you being so mean to me?
Why does everyone hate me?

21:10.853 --> 21:12.354
Cut the drama.

21:12.730 --> 21:16.108
Why are you surprised?
Your car's been messed up for months.

21:16.317 --> 21:19.403
Why would I pay to have it fixed

21:19.862 --> 21:21.864
if I was about to get married?

21:22.615 --> 21:25.785
-What does that have to do with it?
-We wouldn't need two cars.

21:25.951 --> 21:29.330
-I care about the environment.
-That's your answer to everything?

21:29.705 --> 21:32.500
-The environment?
-Your life is stuck, Ana.

21:33.876 --> 21:35.711
Does life start when you find a husband?

21:36.212 --> 21:38.005
You know what? I don't need your help.

21:46.180 --> 21:47.181
Julia!

21:53.979 --> 21:56.607
Can you get me an Uber? My phone's dead.

22:00.736 --> 22:02.613
-I'm getting you a shared Uber.
-Why?

22:02.696 --> 22:03.697
Just because.

22:04.365 --> 22:06.367
"Why don't you get your life in order?"

22:07.576 --> 22:08.494
Bitch.

23:09.638 --> 23:12.641
<i>The first thing you need to do </i>
<i>is get rid of that outfit.</i>

23:12.725 --> 23:14.184
But it's a designer suit!

23:14.268 --> 23:16.520
That suit screams,
"I have no social life

23:16.604 --> 23:19.565
and I eat canned tuna at my desk
every single day."

23:21.442 --> 23:23.861
You have to wear clothes
that are casual but feminine.

23:24.445 --> 23:26.780
You're looking for a husband,
not a job.

23:26.864 --> 23:28.991
You should be wearing
dresses and skirts.

23:29.074 --> 23:33.537
Not too loose but not too tight,
so you don't show your flaws.

23:33.954 --> 23:39.501
Wear solid colors, not prints.
Remember that less is more.

23:39.585 --> 23:40.961
USE FLATTERING CLOTHES

23:41.045 --> 23:42.838
You've been there for ten minutes.

23:42.922 --> 23:44.423
Who are you? What do you want?

23:45.466 --> 23:47.343
My name is Ana. I was here before.

23:48.302 --> 23:51.430
-You said my life was miserable.
-Yes, of course.

23:51.513 --> 23:53.140
I changed my mind. You're right.

23:54.558 --> 23:57.102
Too late. Close the door behind you.

23:57.394 --> 23:59.897
Please! I'm begging you!
I don't want to die single.

24:03.108 --> 24:05.611
I guess I can always rise to a...

24:06.695 --> 24:07.780
challenge.

24:10.324 --> 24:11.617
Where was I?

24:12.034 --> 24:15.871
You said, “Wear solid colors, not prints.

24:15.955 --> 24:19.750
Remember that less is more.
You've been standing--" Oops.

24:20.584 --> 24:26.173
Memorize this: men only notice looks.
They can't help it.

24:26.882 --> 24:28.258
It's in their DNA.

24:28.550 --> 24:31.178
So if you want their attention,

24:32.221 --> 24:34.264
you must improve your looks.

24:36.225 --> 24:41.397
Shouldn't we be with someone
who sees beyond appearances?

24:41.730 --> 24:42.690
I don't know.

24:43.315 --> 24:44.358
You tell me.

24:45.234 --> 24:48.153
How many men have been interested
in your big heart?

24:49.530 --> 24:53.200
Like it or not, girls,
these are the rules of the game.

24:53.659 --> 24:59.373
Use them and you'll be living it up
for the rest of your life.

25:00.499 --> 25:01.667
That's great!

25:04.336 --> 25:08.382
Five thousand pesos?
That's what my whole wardrobe is worth!

25:08.507 --> 25:09.883
It's not that expensive.

25:10.092 --> 25:11.719
Think of it as an investment.

25:11.802 --> 25:15.431
In six months, you'll have a husband
who'll pay that and more.

25:15.514 --> 25:19.101
Great idea! Maybe I'll ask him
to pick out my clothes for me.

25:19.518 --> 25:20.561
Sure, why not?

25:25.357 --> 25:27.693
Don't worry.
I'm used to people staring at me.

25:27.776 --> 25:29.194
I wasn't staring at you.

25:30.988 --> 25:32.740
Six months is perfect for me.

25:32.823 --> 25:36.910
I have a wedding dress on hold
and I have only six payments left.

25:37.161 --> 25:39.038
But you don't have a boyfriend yet.

25:39.788 --> 25:43.959
I can't find anyone I like.
But that dress was love at first sight.

25:46.211 --> 25:48.297
-How are you doing?
-Good.

25:49.548 --> 25:51.925
Let's see, Ema. Try this on.

25:55.262 --> 25:56.388
Are you serious, Lola?

25:56.764 --> 25:57.723
What?

25:58.348 --> 25:59.266
Boxers?

25:59.933 --> 26:01.477
Lots of guys like them.

26:01.560 --> 26:04.229
You must look feminine at all times.

26:04.396 --> 26:06.482
Unless you're not looking
for a man, of course.

26:08.150 --> 26:09.234
Ilse.

26:10.569 --> 26:13.822
Men don't want a wife
who looks like a stripper.

26:14.281 --> 26:15.449
-They don't?
-No.

26:15.824 --> 26:19.203
They want a wife so they can think
about the stripper.

26:19.703 --> 26:20.704
What?

26:20.871 --> 26:23.540
They're men. Don't try
to understand their logic.

26:25.125 --> 26:26.001
Good.

26:26.752 --> 26:28.962
Well done, Sandra.
Much better!

26:33.842 --> 26:36.637
This isn't going to work.
This isn't me, Lucila.

26:36.720 --> 26:39.056
You can be whoever you want, Ana.

26:39.264 --> 26:40.099
Take this.

26:40.641 --> 26:42.351
The new you is going to need that.

26:43.310 --> 26:46.063
Make it quick, ladies.
You still have to get your makeovers.

27:12.631 --> 27:13.632
Julia!

27:13.882 --> 27:16.718
-It's your sister.
-Oh, no. What does she want now?

27:16.802 --> 27:20.597
Open up! I know you're in there!
I can hear you!

27:23.809 --> 27:25.394
Julia!

27:27.146 --> 27:28.438
What is it?

27:40.909 --> 27:42.744
No electricity? Why all the candles?

27:44.163 --> 27:47.541
Anita, you have a knack for showing up
at the best time.

27:47.791 --> 27:48.625
Thanks.

27:52.796 --> 27:54.298
What's with the new look?

27:56.383 --> 27:57.593
And your face?

27:58.927 --> 28:01.722
I decided to try the workshop
Tamara told me about.

28:02.806 --> 28:05.142
-The workshop for desperate women?
-Yes.

28:05.684 --> 28:06.852
They're not desperate.

28:08.979 --> 28:10.814
Well, she is. I'm not.

28:12.274 --> 28:16.361
-Ana, why did you do that?
-You told me to get my life together.

28:16.695 --> 28:19.198
-That's not what I meant.
-What did you mean then?

28:19.781 --> 28:22.117
There are many ways
to make your life meaningful.

28:22.201 --> 28:25.037
-Buy a dog, like everyone else.
-Yeah, a dog.

28:27.581 --> 28:28.874
You know I hate dogs.

28:33.420 --> 28:35.130
You went off the deep end.

28:35.631 --> 28:36.924
For you two...

28:38.050 --> 28:39.885
it's so easy to judge.

28:44.723 --> 28:47.184
-Where are you going?
-We'll talk later.

28:48.560 --> 28:53.232
Your future husband is out there,
and it's up to you to find him.

28:53.649 --> 28:55.484
Lucila, there's nothing. There's no one.

28:55.567 --> 29:01.156
Maybe you were too busy stalking
your ex to find the time to go out.

29:01.240 --> 29:03.492
I'm not stalking him.
He blocked me ages ago

29:03.575 --> 29:05.118
on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram.

29:05.202 --> 29:07.621
You've made your point, Ana. Thank you.

29:08.038 --> 29:12.334
If you really want to meet someone,
you have to leave your comfort zone.

29:12.626 --> 29:14.753
Change your routine.

29:15.045 --> 29:19.091
No more chaperoned dinners,
Netflix nights, or cyber sex.

29:19.800 --> 29:23.679
-I told you that in private.
-For privacy, find a priest, dear.

29:25.514 --> 29:29.309
Stop going to Pilates
and find a class with more men.

29:29.977 --> 29:31.812
Or women, if you prefer.

29:32.396 --> 29:34.815
-Is she talking about me?
-Join a gym.

29:35.190 --> 29:37.985
Go out! There's a whole world
of possibilities out there.

29:39.194 --> 29:43.323
Isn't that why we have internet?
So we don't have to go out.

29:43.615 --> 29:45.450
And look how far it's got you.

29:46.034 --> 29:48.662
I'm not telling you
to give up social media.

29:49.121 --> 29:54.418
Instead, use every possible resource
to maximize your opportunities.

29:55.335 --> 29:56.336
I got it!

29:56.420 --> 29:59.965
Before the next class,
I want you all to go out on a date.

30:00.424 --> 30:02.259
-What?
-In one week?

30:02.843 --> 30:04.303
-That's why I'm here!
-Exactly!

30:04.386 --> 30:06.638
-We need more time.
-What if we double date?

30:06.722 --> 30:08.223
Such a weirdo.

30:13.228 --> 30:16.231
<i>The first thing you have to do</i>
<i>is get his attention.</i>

30:16.481 --> 30:18.734
<i>Usually, a smile is enough,</i>

30:18.817 --> 30:21.653
<i>but I don't think that will be enough</i>
<i>for you girls.</i>

31:01.026 --> 31:03.779
<i>The next step is to find a subtle way</i>

31:04.529 --> 31:05.364
<i>to break the ice.</i>

31:05.447 --> 31:06.656
Hi!

31:08.408 --> 31:10.410
Do you know how to turn this on?

31:10.660 --> 31:12.788
Yes. With the "on" button.

31:28.762 --> 31:29.596
Come on.

31:31.556 --> 31:35.602
<i>If this doesn't work,</i>
<i>take an object to start a conversation.</i>

31:35.685 --> 31:37.354
<i>Or see if he has something.</i>

31:37.437 --> 31:38.355
<i>Everyone dies.</i>

31:39.106 --> 31:40.524
-What?
-Your book.

31:40.982 --> 31:43.318
-Is it good?
-Yes. I'm on page 20.

31:43.944 --> 31:46.154
-It's great. I recommend it.
-Ready?

31:47.697 --> 31:48.698
Yes.

32:01.795 --> 32:04.548
<i>Whatever happens, keep trying.</i>

32:05.465 --> 32:07.300
<i>You're not getting any younger.</i>

32:20.021 --> 32:21.731
Stop retreating and attack!

32:22.107 --> 32:23.567
Keep your guard up!

32:24.067 --> 32:26.278
Is that all you've got?
Come on, soldier, go!

32:29.573 --> 32:31.992
Sorry! Are you OK?

32:38.707 --> 32:40.709
Blow him off. He's an asshole.

32:41.168 --> 32:42.085
Thanks.

32:42.294 --> 32:45.255
<i>If you played your cards right</i>
<i>and you want to see him again...</i>

32:46.089 --> 32:48.508
-Hey?
<i>...you have to find a way to make him</i>

32:48.592 --> 32:51.011
<i>-come back to you.</i>
<i>-</i>Could you give me some classes?

32:52.929 --> 32:54.222
Yeah, sure.

32:58.768 --> 33:00.896
I'm not really into working out.

33:01.480 --> 33:05.442
I signed up for a spinning class,
but I dropped out in two days.

33:06.109 --> 33:07.444
And...

33:07.819 --> 33:12.699
when I was little, I really liked ballet,
but the teacher was a bitch.

33:13.033 --> 33:16.786
One day, all the girls ran up
to the bar saying, "Me first--"

33:16.870 --> 33:19.748
Ana, we don't want your whole life story,

33:20.081 --> 33:21.041
and neither does he.

33:22.334 --> 33:26.129
-Yeah, that's boring.
-Just answer what they're asking.

33:26.421 --> 33:30.008
Don't open up too much
until you really know each other.

33:30.300 --> 33:35.013
But... what if we have
a special connection with someone,

33:35.096 --> 33:38.600
and he tells us things
he's never told anyone before?

33:39.309 --> 33:40.143
Ema,

33:40.810 --> 33:43.855
that's the oldest trick in the book.

33:44.940 --> 33:49.152
Men will set all sorts of traps
to discover your flaws.

33:50.195 --> 33:53.198
-Don't fall for it.
-They'll find out eventually, won't they?

33:53.573 --> 33:56.076
-Yes.
-Isn't it better to be up front?

33:56.159 --> 33:58.078
Information is power, girls.

33:58.995 --> 34:02.707
Show only your good side.
Besides, they'll do the same.

34:03.500 --> 34:04.376
Ema.

34:08.380 --> 34:10.882
"Hey, Ana, I had a phenomenal time.

34:11.341 --> 34:14.511
What if we go back to my place?"

34:14.678 --> 34:16.680
-Yes!
-Sexy!

34:17.264 --> 34:19.349
First of all, who says phenomenal?

34:19.432 --> 34:20.976
Answer the question, Ana.

34:25.188 --> 34:26.106
No.

34:29.276 --> 34:30.485
No.

34:32.862 --> 34:33.738
No!

34:35.365 --> 34:36.783
-Yes?
-No!

34:36.866 --> 34:38.326
That's what I said! No!

34:38.410 --> 34:41.997
Not if you want to keep him
interested! Listen, girls.

34:42.956 --> 34:45.584
You won't gain anything
by having sex on the first date.

34:46.459 --> 34:50.630
Except for some pleasure,
but that's what vibrators are for.

34:50.714 --> 34:53.300
-There are some really good ones.
-Lucila, but--

34:53.383 --> 34:54.801
No exceptions.

34:55.385 --> 34:56.720
What about a hand job?

34:57.220 --> 34:58.179
Does that count?

34:58.972 --> 34:59.806
Lola.

35:00.390 --> 35:01.850
You haven't understood a thing.

35:02.559 --> 35:05.604
Am I imagining things,
or does Lucila think I'm gay?

35:06.479 --> 35:08.148
-You're not?
-Of course not!

35:08.231 --> 35:09.065
Okay.

35:10.442 --> 35:13.903
-Do you think she's married?
-I heard she's been divorced seven times.

35:13.987 --> 35:16.114
Twice from the same guy. Some rich banker.

35:17.032 --> 35:17.949
Maybe he's single?

35:18.700 --> 35:21.119
I just hope her methods work.

35:21.202 --> 35:22.912
So do I. I don't get it.

35:23.580 --> 35:25.790
I go out drinking with a guy.
We party hard.

35:26.291 --> 35:27.959
We have an amazing time.

35:28.043 --> 35:31.463
Then without warning, the next day, poof!
He disappears.

35:31.838 --> 35:33.381
Not even breakfast.

35:33.882 --> 35:34.841
I totally get that.

35:35.133 --> 35:39.054
I know you think I'm perfect,
that there's no way I'm single,

35:39.638 --> 35:42.140
but it's been rough for me as well.

35:42.599 --> 35:46.519
I know. I wasted my best years
with a good-for-nothing.

35:46.936 --> 35:49.356
We got divorced because
he said I worked too much.

35:52.817 --> 35:54.110
What's with Ana?

35:54.653 --> 35:56.613
Come on, Ana! We don't bite.

35:58.198 --> 36:03.703
I just want someone handsome,
romantic, and sensitive.

36:04.537 --> 36:06.414
Basically, someone who doesn't exist.

36:07.582 --> 36:09.626
As long as he's not a psycho.

36:09.876 --> 36:12.128
-Exactly!
-Oh, no!

36:26.393 --> 36:29.979
Hey, you didn't tell me the show
was yours. Well done!

36:30.689 --> 36:33.358
I'm more self-centered than I look.

36:35.527 --> 36:37.153
So, what do you think?

36:38.405 --> 36:41.991
Were the polka dots and sprinkles
your idea?

36:43.326 --> 36:44.452
Yes.

36:44.744 --> 36:48.456
You have a great eye.
That was my original idea.

36:48.748 --> 36:53.294
The juxtaposition of colors
and shapes are suggestive.

36:53.545 --> 36:57.507
-It makes you...
-Crave the donut.

37:00.677 --> 37:01.511
Wow.

37:02.679 --> 37:03.680
Exactly.

37:05.432 --> 37:06.307
Wow.

37:10.145 --> 37:13.398
So, how can a girl like you
still be single?

37:14.274 --> 37:15.567
A girl like me?

37:16.943 --> 37:20.029
Yes. You're pretty, nice.

37:20.363 --> 37:23.450
You're terrible at boxing,
but you can hold your own.

37:25.744 --> 37:29.497
Did you have a bad time with an ex?
What's your secret?

37:32.625 --> 37:35.420
What if we talk about it
once we know each other better?

37:37.464 --> 37:40.258
If you don't tell me,
I'll imagine the worst.

37:45.764 --> 37:46.723
All right, fine.

37:48.308 --> 37:50.518
We broke up 'cause
he wasn't ready for marriage.

37:50.602 --> 37:52.854
And six months later,
I found out he was engaged.

37:52.937 --> 37:55.648
-To a co-worker.
-No!

37:55.815 --> 37:58.985
-What? Really?
-Yes, a real piece of work.

37:59.152 --> 38:01.196
-Wow.
-But you're not like that, right?

38:01.654 --> 38:04.616
What? Me? No. Not at all.

38:29.057 --> 38:29.891
Hello.

38:30.058 --> 38:32.977
<i>Ana, tell me everything.</i>
<i>I want all the details.</i>

38:33.061 --> 38:33.937
Who's this?

38:34.521 --> 38:35.355
<i>Ema.</i>

38:35.772 --> 38:38.149
-Who?
-Ema, from the workshop.

38:39.859 --> 38:40.860
What's up?

38:41.194 --> 38:44.864
-Can we talk later? I'm busy.
-Hello there!

38:45.240 --> 38:47.450
All the girls are here on the line.

38:47.617 --> 38:49.536
There's not much to tell. His name is--

38:49.619 --> 38:50.620
My night was a mess.

38:51.162 --> 38:53.206
We went to watch the game
with his friends.

38:53.289 --> 38:55.250
Finally, when we were alone,

38:55.667 --> 38:57.210
he asked me to...

38:58.044 --> 39:00.463
-He asked me to sit on his face.
-I'm jealous!

39:00.547 --> 39:01.422
Yummy!

39:01.506 --> 39:04.133
My date brought me
to an incredible place.

39:04.217 --> 39:06.261
This guy is seriously hot.

39:07.846 --> 39:11.015
At first things were great.
He's a lawyer, good looking.

39:11.099 --> 39:15.186
But the asshole spent the night
on his phone, supposedly working.

39:15.478 --> 39:18.773
-Sounds like someone I know, Sandra.
-What? I'm not like that.

39:18.857 --> 39:20.650
-Yes, you are.
-Just a little bit.

39:20.733 --> 39:24.279
We ended up having a party at my place.
I feel lucky tonight!

39:24.779 --> 39:27.615
-Wait, here he comes.
-Lola, can we borrow your room?

39:27.699 --> 39:28.867
What?

39:30.034 --> 39:30.869
Lola?

39:30.952 --> 39:34.622
I think I should go now.
I can barely keep my eyes open.

39:35.039 --> 39:37.333
-Why are you whispering?
-I'm not whispering!

39:37.417 --> 39:39.252
Are you still with the photographer?

39:40.003 --> 39:42.422
If I had said no,
he would have found someone hotter.

39:42.505 --> 39:44.591
Don't worry. Lucila exaggerates.

39:44.674 --> 39:46.843
-For sure he'll call you again.
-He will, right?

39:47.802 --> 39:48.636
Yes.

39:49.053 --> 39:51.139
-Bye!
-Sleep tight.

39:53.641 --> 39:54.559
Yes. For sure.

40:10.116 --> 40:12.243
-Hi, I'm Max.
-Hello.

40:13.453 --> 40:16.748
-I'm Ana.
-Wow, you look just like my ex.

40:19.334 --> 40:20.919
Sorry, these are for you.

40:22.253 --> 40:24.047
-My favorite.
-Sweet.

40:29.761 --> 40:31.012
Her name is Monica.

40:31.346 --> 40:32.972
She's dating someone else now.

40:33.056 --> 40:36.225
What if we skip dinner
and watch a movie at my place?

40:36.559 --> 40:39.479
-I live around the corner.
-Thanks, but I'd rather not.

40:40.438 --> 40:42.649
-Why? Are you a screamer?
-What?

40:43.232 --> 40:44.192
Do you want to share?

40:44.275 --> 40:47.654
The portions are small.
We can try lots of things.

40:48.404 --> 40:49.322
All right.

40:49.781 --> 40:50.990
How about octopus ceviche?

40:51.074 --> 40:53.201
How about something
without tentacles?

40:54.994 --> 40:55.870
Sure.

40:56.412 --> 40:59.791
How about a pizza with anchovies?
Or mushrooms?

41:02.710 --> 41:04.796
Why don't we order separately?

41:10.426 --> 41:13.221
Tell me. Why did you break up
with your ex?

41:13.304 --> 41:16.683
He wasn't a good person,
but I learned a lot from him.

41:17.517 --> 41:18.643
Excuse me.

41:20.311 --> 41:22.063
-Is that work?
-No.

41:22.605 --> 41:23.481
My wife.

41:24.148 --> 41:25.483
You're married?

41:26.025 --> 41:27.360
You don't mind, do you?

41:29.362 --> 41:30.238
Thank you.

41:30.989 --> 41:31.990
See you.

41:32.073 --> 41:33.282
Wait.

41:34.367 --> 41:36.577
We had a nice dinner. I drove you home.

41:38.413 --> 41:40.957
Gross! No!

41:42.250 --> 41:43.292
I love you!

42:04.605 --> 42:06.232
Can I see your ID?

42:07.191 --> 42:09.861
-Are you joking?
-Sorry, store policy.

42:11.779 --> 42:13.698
I don't have it on me. I left it at home.

42:14.115 --> 42:18.411
So, go home, get your ID,
and come back later.

42:18.494 --> 42:19.328
What?

42:19.537 --> 42:20.371
No.

42:20.747 --> 42:23.332
Do you know how long ago
I stopped being underage?

42:24.417 --> 42:26.044
It's a rhetorical question.

42:27.003 --> 42:29.881
Sorry, I can't sell you beer
without an ID.

42:29.964 --> 42:31.966
It's beer, not meth.

42:52.445 --> 42:55.656
Can you buy me some beer?
The clerk won't sell me any.

42:56.074 --> 42:57.075
I don't know.

42:57.533 --> 43:00.703
I don't want to get in trouble.
How do I know you're old enough?

43:01.079 --> 43:01.913
What?

43:05.333 --> 43:06.167
Okay.

43:14.884 --> 43:17.136
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

43:17.929 --> 43:20.389
-Did you find everything?
-I did.

43:21.641 --> 43:23.351
What about his ID?

43:24.936 --> 43:26.771
That'll be 96 pesos, sir.

43:36.614 --> 43:37.698
Thank you.

43:38.032 --> 43:39.784
-Your receipt.
-Keep it.

43:43.246 --> 43:44.997
-Well, bye.
-Bye.

43:55.174 --> 43:56.008
Hey!

44:01.389 --> 44:02.306
Thank you.

44:03.224 --> 44:04.142
You're welcome.

44:04.767 --> 44:05.768
What's your name?

44:06.227 --> 44:07.854
Diego. What's yours?

44:08.855 --> 44:09.730
Ana.

44:11.065 --> 44:12.024
"Ana?

44:13.609 --> 44:16.904
-You look great."
-"Thank you.

44:17.488 --> 44:19.407
You look great too."

44:21.742 --> 44:25.413
"Do you want to kiss me?
Just kidding."

44:31.127 --> 44:32.378
Okay. Just like that.

44:39.385 --> 44:40.219
Diego.

44:41.012 --> 44:41.888
Ana!

44:41.971 --> 44:43.014
-Hi.
-Hi,

44:43.598 --> 44:45.099
-how are you?
-Fine.

44:51.397 --> 44:54.066
-I have the tickets. Shall we go in?
-Okay.

44:56.027 --> 44:58.029
Did you bring your ID?

44:59.614 --> 45:01.616
I wouldn't like it if you couldn't get in.

45:34.649 --> 45:35.566
Want some?

45:38.361 --> 45:39.946
-Thanks.
-You're welcome.

45:46.118 --> 45:47.912
-Did you like the movie?
-Yes.

45:48.537 --> 45:50.539
I don't know
why I'd never seen it before.

45:50.957 --> 45:53.084
Maybe when you went to see it,
you fell asleep.

45:55.044 --> 45:56.170
No! Why?

45:57.380 --> 45:58.673
No reason.

45:58.839 --> 46:01.175
No way. I never fall asleep at the movies.

46:01.676 --> 46:04.387
-Never.
-Well, that's good to know.

46:08.891 --> 46:11.269
Are <i>masago </i>the little jelly-like balls?

46:11.352 --> 46:12.436
Yes.

46:13.896 --> 46:16.816
-Do you know what you're having?
-There are too many choices.

46:17.608 --> 46:20.194
-I recommend the<i> omakaze.</i>
-Oma... what?

46:20.278 --> 46:23.614
The chef makes a special dish
with the catch of the day.

46:23.864 --> 46:26.117
It's great if you like to try everything.

46:26.534 --> 46:27.451
Sounds good.

46:28.869 --> 46:30.413
Two<i> omakazes, </i>please.

46:31.289 --> 46:32.581
Well then, cheers.

46:33.582 --> 46:35.042
Tell me about yourself.

46:37.086 --> 46:41.090
-What do you do?
-I work in a digital media firm.

46:41.173 --> 46:45.052
Our company handles corporate
social media and creates content.

46:45.136 --> 46:48.097
-How long have you been there?
-Four years. No, five.

46:49.098 --> 46:51.100
I thought it would be temporary.

46:52.184 --> 46:54.312
-But I stayed.
-That happens.

46:54.687 --> 46:58.107
I spent eight years
at a firm and the time flew by.

46:58.482 --> 47:01.360
-Are you a lawyer? Architect.
-Architect.

47:04.864 --> 47:05.865
Thank you.

47:07.616 --> 47:11.120
This is called <i>ankimo.</i>

47:11.704 --> 47:15.624
Thank you. It's a kind of foie gras
made from fish liver.

47:16.000 --> 47:17.835
-Wow! Yeah.
-You'll love it.

47:24.342 --> 47:25.343
Delicious.

47:38.564 --> 47:39.607
Did you like it?

47:44.362 --> 47:46.364
-It's really good.
-I told you.

47:56.082 --> 47:57.291
Thank you very much.

47:58.000 --> 48:00.127
I can tell everyone I tried<i> ankimo.</i>

48:01.420 --> 48:02.880
That's a bold statement.

48:26.195 --> 48:27.780
I think we have company.

48:31.242 --> 48:34.662
It's my neighbor. She's really nosy.
I hate her.

48:36.372 --> 48:38.916
Should we go in
or keep entertaining her?

48:44.630 --> 48:45.464
Yes.

48:52.054 --> 48:53.180
You know what?

48:53.806 --> 48:55.683
I just remembered
I have to work tomorrow.

48:56.475 --> 48:57.393
Super early.

48:58.060 --> 48:59.353
Really?

49:00.271 --> 49:03.524
I have an early meeting tomorrow too.
Maybe some other time?

49:04.150 --> 49:05.568
All right. Are you sure?

49:05.651 --> 49:07.194
-I'm sure.
-All right.

49:07.695 --> 49:08.571
Okay.

49:09.196 --> 49:10.030
Bye.

49:10.114 --> 49:11.031
Bye.

49:14.410 --> 49:16.162
Okay. Everything's fine.

49:16.704 --> 49:18.622
It's fine. You did well, Ana.

49:19.665 --> 49:20.624
HI! ANA HERE

49:20.708 --> 49:22.626
-So?
-We had our first kiss.

49:22.710 --> 49:24.128
-French kiss?
-No.

49:24.211 --> 49:26.255
-Then it's not a real kiss.
-Good.

49:26.338 --> 49:27.423
Good.

49:28.257 --> 49:29.258
Well done, Ema.

49:30.092 --> 49:32.094
I must admit I had no faith in you.

49:32.803 --> 49:34.013
But you've surprised me.

49:34.555 --> 49:36.432
-Thanks?
-I'd also planned a fourth date.

49:36.724 --> 49:39.518
But Álvaro had to leave town,
so we postponed it.

49:39.935 --> 49:42.354
-Didn't he leave three weeks ago?
-Yes.

49:42.688 --> 49:44.607
-That's strange.
-He's a businessman.

49:44.773 --> 49:46.358
I don't know.

49:46.650 --> 49:49.153
I wanted someone romantic and sensitive,

49:49.236 --> 49:53.032
but Tonatiuh is a bit rough
and he curses. And he doesn't like cats.

49:53.115 --> 49:54.283
Maybe he's allergic?

49:54.575 --> 49:56.494
I SAW A JAPANESE PLACE
AND THOUGHT OF YOU.

49:56.577 --> 49:59.455
Lower your expectations, girls.
There are no perfect men.

49:59.747 --> 50:02.208
Only women who can't shape them.

50:02.666 --> 50:05.753
I'm not so sure.
How do you shape a guy who's married?

50:06.086 --> 50:07.254
That's terrible!

50:07.922 --> 50:09.924
All men are pigs.

50:10.007 --> 50:11.884
-Not all of them.
-What about you, Ana?

50:12.468 --> 50:14.053
Have you heard from him?

50:14.845 --> 50:17.598
At first, I thought his phone
was broken, because...

50:18.224 --> 50:19.266
Just because.

50:20.100 --> 50:23.062
But I just saw the idiot
logged on to WhatsApp.

50:23.145 --> 50:25.314
-What?
-How long since you heard from him?

50:25.648 --> 50:27.775
Two weeks. I don't get it.
He liked my posts.

50:27.858 --> 50:28.859
Typical.

50:29.401 --> 50:30.486
What if I call him?

50:31.195 --> 50:35.157
-If he's interested, he'll find you.
-Come on! Just a five-minute call!

50:36.909 --> 50:39.745
-A Facebook message?
-There are plenty of fish in the sea.

50:40.371 --> 50:43.958
Go out! Meet new people.
The same goes for all of you.

50:46.585 --> 50:47.545
Is that him?

50:48.879 --> 50:50.089
PORN STAR REPORTS THREATS

50:50.172 --> 50:53.050
-Shitty cellphone news!
-I hate it.

50:53.801 --> 50:55.177
No.

50:56.136 --> 50:57.179
Gross.

51:00.224 --> 51:01.058
Gross.

51:02.643 --> 51:03.811
No.

51:16.865 --> 51:18.033
IT'S A MATCH!

51:18.993 --> 51:19.952
You look good.

51:20.786 --> 51:23.789
Although you look much better
in your profile pic.

51:23.872 --> 51:26.292
Thanks. It took me a long time
to photoshop it.

51:26.500 --> 51:27.668
I can imagine.

51:29.128 --> 51:30.087
How about a drink?

51:31.005 --> 51:33.924
-Hilario here makes a killer <i>michelada.</i>
<i>-</i>Hello.

51:35.259 --> 51:37.469
-What are you having?
-A <i>michelada.</i>

51:37.636 --> 51:40.306
-And you?
-Some <i>pulque, </i>Hilario, please.

51:40.806 --> 51:41.849
That'll be 100 pesos.

51:45.019 --> 51:47.521
Oops, I forgot my wallet.

51:48.606 --> 51:51.775
Can you take care of this round,
and I'll pay for the next one?

51:58.782 --> 52:00.868
-I'll be right back.
-Thanks.

52:02.453 --> 52:04.163
Your profile says you're a musician.

52:04.246 --> 52:06.248
Yeah, I'm gonna record an album.

52:06.332 --> 52:09.543
We've got the studio lined up
and we're getting the money together.

52:09.627 --> 52:11.295
-Hello.
<i>-Hi, Ana!</i>

52:11.837 --> 52:13.714
-Diego?
-<i>I hope you don't hate me.</i>

52:14.089 --> 52:17.343
<i>The truth is I've had a lot of work.</i>
<i>How are you doing?</i>

52:17.718 --> 52:18.844
Good, all good.

52:19.637 --> 52:20.471
What's up?

52:20.554 --> 52:21.597
<i>Are you busy right now?</i>

52:21.889 --> 52:23.265
No, I'm not busy.

52:23.349 --> 52:24.558
<i>When can we get together?</i>

52:25.434 --> 52:29.855
This week is a little complicated,
but maybe I can make it on Saturday.

52:30.314 --> 52:32.358
<i>-Saturday's perfect. Let me know.</i>
-Deal.

52:34.568 --> 52:35.694
Well, bye.

52:50.084 --> 52:51.669
-Do you like the place?
-Yes.

52:52.127 --> 52:53.128
I love it.

52:55.214 --> 52:58.425
This place has fantastic homemade cheese.

52:59.343 --> 53:01.762
I like how excited you get
when you talk about food.

53:01.845 --> 53:03.681
Really? I can also be a little annoying.

53:03.764 --> 53:04.807
-Really?
-Yes.

53:05.516 --> 53:08.310
That place has a <i>Pad Thai </i>to die for.

53:09.228 --> 53:11.105
What's in it? Shrimp?

53:11.855 --> 53:12.731
What?

53:13.065 --> 53:15.025
-You've never had <i>Pad Thai?</i>
-No.

53:15.567 --> 53:17.820
Can I order you one? You won't be sorry.

53:20.447 --> 53:21.407
A little less.

53:23.117 --> 53:25.661
Less. Less than that.

53:25.744 --> 53:27.621
Less.

53:44.513 --> 53:45.556
Do you like it?

53:48.016 --> 53:49.643
-A lot.
-Really?

53:50.436 --> 53:51.812
It doesn't look like it.

53:54.356 --> 53:57.443
-Ana, you don't have to eat it.
-But I want to.

53:57.526 --> 53:58.944
You really don't have to.

53:59.862 --> 54:03.073
I have a better idea.
Let's eat something you like.

54:03.824 --> 54:05.784
Would you mind if we start with dessert?

54:05.868 --> 54:06.952
Not at all.

54:11.915 --> 54:12.791
What about mangoes?

54:13.333 --> 54:14.752
Too stringy.

54:15.878 --> 54:16.962
Strawberries?

54:18.046 --> 54:19.173
Only if it's jam.

54:19.506 --> 54:21.049
Obviously no seafood.

54:21.759 --> 54:22.634
Why obviously?

54:23.010 --> 54:25.596
-I can tell.
-It smells too much like the ocean.

54:25.679 --> 54:27.639
-But it's not obvious.
-I told you so.

54:28.390 --> 54:30.142
I really like chocolate ice cream.

54:30.225 --> 54:32.436
I'll have a serious talk
with your parents.

54:33.103 --> 54:34.188
Whenever you want.

54:34.563 --> 54:36.231
Are they still together?

54:36.815 --> 54:38.442
Thirty-five years.

54:39.067 --> 54:41.695
They just celebrated their anniversary.
I have pictures.

54:43.030 --> 54:44.114
Let's see them.

54:48.577 --> 54:49.953
I think I deleted them.

54:50.913 --> 54:54.374
-What about your parents?
-Divorced. My sister and I were little.

54:55.209 --> 54:58.587
-And you stayed with...?
-My mom. My dad moved away.

54:58.962 --> 55:00.255
He had another son...

55:00.964 --> 55:02.049
and named him Diego.

55:02.841 --> 55:04.718
-No way.
-Way.

55:07.930 --> 55:09.056
Holy shit.

55:11.391 --> 55:12.351
Do you look alike?

55:13.644 --> 55:15.896
Yes, but I got the good genes.

55:17.022 --> 55:18.732
-Really?
-Really.

56:41.273 --> 56:42.274
What happened?

56:43.233 --> 56:45.193
-What happened?
-What happened?

56:47.279 --> 56:48.280
Hi.

56:48.447 --> 56:50.240
-Morning.
-Good morning.

56:55.495 --> 56:57.706
-I have to go to work.
-What?

56:57.915 --> 56:59.666
No, I don't want you to go.

57:01.251 --> 57:03.170
-Is this your way of trapping me?
-No.

57:03.337 --> 57:05.339
-No?
-This is.

57:09.009 --> 57:09.968
I have to go.

57:11.595 --> 57:12.763
I really have to go.

57:22.272 --> 57:24.483
-Good luck with your meeting.
-Thank you.

57:28.236 --> 57:29.613
Don't say hi to her.

57:30.864 --> 57:32.491
-Dinner at my place?
-Yes.

57:33.283 --> 57:34.493
See you there.

57:39.414 --> 57:40.707
I'm crazy about you.

57:42.376 --> 57:43.585
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

57:52.135 --> 57:54.096
-Let me see it.
-Look at it. It's beautiful!

57:54.179 --> 57:55.764
-It's beautiful!
-Can I try it on?

57:55.847 --> 57:56.807
No.

57:56.890 --> 57:59.518
-My mom says I shouldn't.
-Your mom won't let you?

57:59.601 --> 58:02.020
-Isn't it a bit big?
-I don't know.

58:02.104 --> 58:03.105
What's going on?

58:04.564 --> 58:07.275
-Tonatiuh gave me a ring.
-Because she gave her ring to him.

58:08.443 --> 58:12.406
On our way back from the beach,
he took out a cute little box,

58:12.489 --> 58:14.616
and asked me to marry him!

58:14.908 --> 58:16.451
Isn't it amazing, Ana?

58:16.535 --> 58:19.454
Who would have thought
I'd be the first one!

58:20.539 --> 58:22.332
Ana, are you all right?

58:22.666 --> 58:23.500
Yes, why?

58:24.376 --> 58:25.919
Your face looks weird.

58:27.212 --> 58:29.881
No. Why? I'm smiling.
This is my happy face.

58:34.219 --> 58:35.137
Ana!

58:35.679 --> 58:36.513
What?

58:37.180 --> 58:38.056
Yes.

58:40.183 --> 58:41.018
Sorry,

58:41.768 --> 58:43.645
am I the only one amazed by Ema's news?

58:43.729 --> 58:46.565
-No. I am, too.
-You mean her engagement?

58:46.732 --> 58:49.818
Yes. I don't want to be mean.
I like her and all,

58:49.901 --> 58:51.987
but she's not the smartest
or the prettiest.

58:52.362 --> 58:56.283
-How did she get a ring so fast?
-I'm not taking it personal.

58:56.366 --> 58:57.784
It was beginner's luck.

58:57.868 --> 59:01.288
I don't think it was luck.
The ring looks super fake.

59:01.663 --> 59:05.500
-Wasn't it too much?
-Don't despair, girls.

59:05.917 --> 59:09.755
Each case is different.
You'll get your ring too.

59:11.214 --> 59:14.885
-First, find out if he wants marriage.
-Men don't like that topic.

59:14.968 --> 59:17.554
That's why you'll have to find out
without them noticing.

59:17.804 --> 59:21.099
-But how?
-Make up an event.

59:21.600 --> 59:25.854
Something to help you figure out
exactly where you stand.

59:26.605 --> 59:27.606
For instance:

59:28.648 --> 59:30.984
"I was offered a job abroad."

59:32.569 --> 59:35.280
"My best friend is about to get married."

59:36.656 --> 59:39.493
"My lease is about to expire."

59:40.285 --> 59:41.203
That's crazy.

59:41.495 --> 59:45.040
My lease is about to expire too.
What a coincidence!

59:45.123 --> 59:48.877
Once you've put the idea in his head,

59:49.377 --> 59:53.632
you'll create the perfect moment
for him to give you a ring.

59:54.091 --> 59:57.385
-A trip is always the best option.
-Or you can always get pregnant.

59:57.469 --> 59:58.804
Oh, no. No way!

1:00:00.263 --> 1:00:02.891
-And if he doesn't want to get married?
-Keep looking.

1:00:03.350 --> 1:00:06.978
It's better to lose three months
than to spend a lifetime waiting.

1:00:07.562 --> 1:00:09.481
-That's right.
-How nerve-racking.

1:00:24.746 --> 1:00:25.914
This way.

1:00:31.878 --> 1:00:33.296
What a beautiful view!

1:00:35.924 --> 1:00:37.050
Look here, babe!

1:00:38.135 --> 1:00:39.886
My favorite!

1:00:41.972 --> 1:00:44.683
Your plan is to never leave the room,
right?

1:00:50.313 --> 1:00:52.357
I'm going to take a shower.
I'm all sweaty.

1:01:34.191 --> 1:01:36.359
-Hi.
-I forgot my bag.

1:01:47.996 --> 1:01:50.790
SEND A PICTURE AS SOON
AS YOU GET THERE. LET US KNOW.

1:01:50.874 --> 1:01:55.086
I THINK SOMEONE'S
GONNA GET MARRIED!

1:01:55.253 --> 1:01:59.799
As you can see, this wine
is light and easy to drink.

1:02:00.926 --> 1:02:04.387
It's very crisp,
with some citric undertones.

1:02:09.684 --> 1:02:10.685
Tasty.

1:02:10.769 --> 1:02:13.188
It needs to breathe more, but I like it.

1:02:14.022 --> 1:02:16.524
I don't taste the citrus.
It tastes more like...

1:02:17.317 --> 1:02:18.235
Apples.

1:02:21.404 --> 1:02:23.448
Why did you become such a wine expert?

1:02:24.282 --> 1:02:26.326
Obviously, to impress a girl.

1:02:27.869 --> 1:02:31.665
-An ex-girlfriend?
-A girl who loved wine.

1:02:31.748 --> 1:02:34.209
I took a class to get closer to her.

1:02:35.669 --> 1:02:36.628
And then?

1:02:37.337 --> 1:02:40.340
It turned out
she wanted to impress someone else.

1:02:44.344 --> 1:02:46.012
-Was she pretty?
-Yes.

1:02:46.763 --> 1:02:49.432
-Not as much as you.
-Yeah, right.

1:02:50.642 --> 1:02:52.477
So, who dumped who?

1:02:53.603 --> 1:02:55.397
Let's say it was mutual.

1:02:56.523 --> 1:02:57.482
You got dumped.

1:02:59.317 --> 1:03:00.485
What happened next?

1:03:00.777 --> 1:03:03.280
She went on a trip to find herself.

1:03:04.864 --> 1:03:05.782
And then?

1:03:06.908 --> 1:03:09.035
During her spiritual quest,

1:03:09.452 --> 1:03:11.288
the tour guide got her pregnant.

1:03:12.122 --> 1:03:13.665
-No!
-Yes.

1:03:13.790 --> 1:03:15.792
-Wow!
-Wow.

1:03:16.126 --> 1:03:18.295
Why did you break up with your boyfriend?

1:03:21.089 --> 1:03:23.341
Well, we wanted different things.

1:03:24.301 --> 1:03:26.511
He wanted to date his co-worker
and I didn't.

1:03:31.224 --> 1:03:33.643
Well, I'm very glad it didn't work out.

1:03:35.020 --> 1:03:36.104
So am I.

1:03:46.239 --> 1:03:47.866
Hold on a second.

1:04:02.088 --> 1:04:03.423
I'm getting sort of hungry.

1:04:04.966 --> 1:04:06.217
-Aren't you?
-Right.

1:04:07.594 --> 1:04:08.720
Shall we get some food?

1:04:09.679 --> 1:04:11.056
-Let's go.
-Sure.

1:04:31.826 --> 1:04:35.038
I'd love to stay,
but I want to beat the traffic.

1:04:35.997 --> 1:04:37.415
Yeah, me too.

1:04:42.670 --> 1:04:44.422
MESSAGE FROM EMA
"BACHELORETTES"

1:04:44.798 --> 1:04:47.133
HOW DID IT GO?
CAN WE START CELEBRATING?

1:04:49.052 --> 1:04:50.762
WEDDING!
WHAT SHOULD I WEAR?

1:04:54.057 --> 1:04:55.016
I need the bathroom.

1:05:29.843 --> 1:05:31.010
We need to talk.

1:05:31.344 --> 1:05:33.680
Sure. I'll just take this down.

1:05:34.389 --> 1:05:35.723
I'm pregnant.

1:05:45.066 --> 1:05:46.109
Are you sure?

1:05:47.652 --> 1:05:48.611
Yes.

1:05:58.663 --> 1:05:59.914
I can't believe it!

1:06:08.465 --> 1:06:10.383
No wonder you look a little chubbier.

1:06:21.144 --> 1:06:22.020
Wait.

1:06:26.399 --> 1:06:28.401
It's not what I had in mind, but...

1:06:32.363 --> 1:06:33.781
Will you marry me?

1:06:34.908 --> 1:06:35.909
Yes.

1:06:36.868 --> 1:06:38.077
-Yes?
-Yes!

1:06:46.920 --> 1:06:48.129
I'm going to be a dad.

1:07:01.601 --> 1:07:02.727
Cheers!

1:07:02.810 --> 1:07:05.271
To Ana and the brave man
she managed to reel in.

1:07:05.355 --> 1:07:07.357
-Congratulations!
-To the brave man!

1:07:10.610 --> 1:07:14.322
Ana, when I found out, I felt like crying.

1:07:14.822 --> 1:07:18.243
-You felt the same for me, right?
-Exactly the same.

1:07:19.285 --> 1:07:23.164
You know what we should do?
A double wedding!

1:07:23.581 --> 1:07:27.252
Picture it. We walk in
from different corners.

1:07:27.335 --> 1:07:29.963
Celine Dion is playing,
rose petals everywhere.

1:07:30.046 --> 1:07:32.423
If I were you,
I wouldn't miss that chance.

1:07:33.091 --> 1:07:37.262
How did you get him to propose?
Give us some tips.

1:07:38.054 --> 1:07:41.808
It's all thanks to Lucila.
I just followed her advice.

1:07:42.350 --> 1:07:45.228
It's all thanks to her. Thank you, Lucila.

1:07:45.562 --> 1:07:46.896
Yeah, that's right.

1:07:59.409 --> 1:08:00.243
Lucila.

1:08:00.410 --> 1:08:02.954
I didn't think you'd manage
to do it so fast.

1:08:04.455 --> 1:08:05.415
What did you do?

1:08:06.124 --> 1:08:07.959
I don't know what you're talking about.

1:08:08.626 --> 1:08:11.004
You're not exactly a star student.

1:08:11.963 --> 1:08:14.215
Fine, but please don't judge me.
I feel awful--

1:08:14.299 --> 1:08:15.216
Ana.

1:08:18.595 --> 1:08:20.388
I lied about being pregnant.

1:08:24.892 --> 1:08:26.269
That was a risky move.

1:08:27.020 --> 1:08:28.104
I hope it works.

1:08:32.942 --> 1:08:35.153
Ana, here you are. Come here.

1:08:35.570 --> 1:08:36.988
-Why? What?
-It's starting.

1:08:37.071 --> 1:08:38.364
-What?
-You'll see.

1:08:45.788 --> 1:08:48.708
Let me know if you want a private dance
or anything else.

1:08:49.334 --> 1:08:51.044
I get a special discount.

1:08:58.635 --> 1:09:00.511
She's getting married! She's the one!

1:09:00.595 --> 1:09:02.138
So am I!

1:09:18.946 --> 1:09:20.490
Godzilla!

1:09:20.615 --> 1:09:22.283
-Godzilla!
-Godzilla!

1:09:22.825 --> 1:09:26.329
-Godzilla!
-Godzilla!

1:09:26.704 --> 1:09:28.456
Give her a good farewell!

1:09:45.056 --> 1:09:46.766
I'd love to see your work.

1:09:47.558 --> 1:09:49.602
Ana told me you're a great painter.

1:09:50.186 --> 1:09:53.314
Actually, I no longer paint.
I mostly teach now.

1:09:53.481 --> 1:09:57.193
I always say my wife's talent
is wasted.

1:09:58.027 --> 1:10:00.571
We have some news to share.

1:10:03.366 --> 1:10:04.909
We're getting married.

1:10:13.793 --> 1:10:15.211
You're not going say anything?

1:10:15.586 --> 1:10:17.839
What do you mean?
When did you start dating?

1:10:19.757 --> 1:10:21.300
-Three months ago.
-Six months ago.

1:10:23.428 --> 1:10:26.764
-When's the wedding?
-Next month.

1:10:28.224 --> 1:10:30.852
We don't want to waste
a whole year planning it.

1:10:30.935 --> 1:10:32.061
Isn't it too soon?

1:10:33.020 --> 1:10:35.314
Unless they had a slipup.

1:10:35.398 --> 1:10:36.315
Come on, Dad.

1:10:36.983 --> 1:10:38.109
Of course not.

1:10:38.651 --> 1:10:40.194
Well, actually...

1:10:42.864 --> 1:10:44.115
Are you pregnant?

1:10:47.535 --> 1:10:48.619
Yes.

1:10:53.791 --> 1:10:54.917
Well then.

1:10:55.084 --> 1:10:56.919
Cheers to that. Congratulations.

1:10:57.003 --> 1:10:57.962
Thanks.

1:10:58.171 --> 1:11:00.173
I know it's a bit rushed, but...

1:11:00.465 --> 1:11:02.967
Your daughter's in good hands.

1:11:03.384 --> 1:11:06.220
We're out of wine.
Will you help me, Anita?

1:11:09.891 --> 1:11:11.142
I'll be right back.

1:11:18.691 --> 1:11:19.817
What the fuck?

1:11:20.318 --> 1:11:21.861
Why didn't you tell me anything?

1:11:22.278 --> 1:11:25.740
-We haven't seen each other.
-And you don't have a phone?

1:11:27.033 --> 1:11:30.036
Not long ago, you were crying
over Gabriel, and now this.

1:11:30.870 --> 1:11:33.331
-You don't even know him!
-Of course I know him.

1:11:34.665 --> 1:11:36.209
What are his parents' names?

1:11:37.794 --> 1:11:38.669
Carola...

1:11:39.754 --> 1:11:40.797
and Agustín.

1:11:41.047 --> 1:11:42.507
You're pregnant.

1:11:46.052 --> 1:11:49.514
-Do you need something?
-You should come back to the living room.

1:11:50.973 --> 1:11:52.225
Don't touch me.

1:11:54.143 --> 1:11:55.520
I said don't touch me.

1:12:01.359 --> 1:12:02.360
What is it?

1:12:02.527 --> 1:12:04.737
Your mom had a bit too much to drink.

1:12:04.821 --> 1:12:06.489
You're shameless.

1:12:06.948 --> 1:12:10.409
Do you know who came home at 3:00 a.m.
with some friends he made at a bar?

1:12:10.493 --> 1:12:13.830
-It wasn't 3:00 a.m.
-They were high school kids, Héctor!

1:12:13.913 --> 1:12:16.082
-Do you know how ridiculous you look?
-Hey.

1:12:16.165 --> 1:12:18.543
Why don't you talk about this
in your own home?

1:12:18.751 --> 1:12:22.755
Your mother doesn't want me
to have a life. I'm retired, not dead.

1:12:23.256 --> 1:12:25.758
What I want is not to be
the only adult in the room.

1:12:26.175 --> 1:12:29.011
-You tell me the same thing.
-You don't say.

1:12:29.095 --> 1:12:30.054
You know what?

1:12:30.137 --> 1:12:32.473
It's getting late
and my head is about to explode.

1:12:34.350 --> 1:12:36.394
-It was nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

1:12:38.688 --> 1:12:41.399
-Congratulations, sweetie.
-Nice to meet you.

1:12:41.482 --> 1:12:44.026
I think we should leave too, don't you?

1:12:44.193 --> 1:12:46.571
-Shall we leave?
-Yes, let's leave.

1:12:47.238 --> 1:12:48.072
Nice to meet you.

1:12:49.073 --> 1:12:50.199
Nice to meet you too.

1:12:52.159 --> 1:12:52.994
Bye.

1:12:53.411 --> 1:12:55.663
-Welcome to the family.
-Thank you.

1:13:01.335 --> 1:13:03.588
Sorry. I don't know what got into them.

1:13:04.338 --> 1:13:06.841
You know my parents are divorced.

1:13:07.383 --> 1:13:08.384
It's all right.

1:13:09.218 --> 1:13:10.219
Really.

1:13:10.803 --> 1:13:11.804
Besides,

1:13:12.388 --> 1:13:14.807
we don't want to upset our little bean.

1:13:18.603 --> 1:13:20.062
Don't worry, babe.

1:13:25.985 --> 1:13:27.778
What the hell happened yesterday?

1:13:29.280 --> 1:13:31.866
You're so stressed out.
Have a drop of tequila.

1:13:31.949 --> 1:13:33.034
I don't want tequila.

1:13:34.911 --> 1:13:35.745
Maybe a sip.

1:13:35.828 --> 1:13:37.455
No way! Not even a sip.

1:13:38.122 --> 1:13:39.290
You're pregnant, Ana.

1:13:39.665 --> 1:13:41.042
You made me look like a fool.

1:13:41.459 --> 1:13:43.794
You're ruining the happiest time
of my life!

1:13:43.878 --> 1:13:45.171
We're getting divorced, Ana.

1:13:49.550 --> 1:13:51.719
We wanted to wait until after the wedding.

1:13:52.219 --> 1:13:53.888
But there's no point in delaying it.

1:13:54.055 --> 1:13:55.306
Her idea, not mine.

1:13:57.934 --> 1:13:59.810
You can't do this to me.

1:14:01.646 --> 1:14:03.940
I'm about to get married!

1:14:04.357 --> 1:14:05.524
Look, Ana.

1:14:05.733 --> 1:14:07.735
This has nothing to do with you.

1:14:08.277 --> 1:14:10.321
Well, just a little.

1:14:11.280 --> 1:14:14.492
Yesterday, after hearing your news,
we started thinking.

1:14:14.575 --> 1:14:16.661
We realized that life is too short,

1:14:16.953 --> 1:14:19.288
and we don't want
to spend any more time together.

1:14:19.372 --> 1:14:21.374
I'm so glad I could help.

1:14:22.333 --> 1:14:24.126
I can't believe how selfish you are.

1:14:25.294 --> 1:14:27.296
-Ana--
-I will not allow you...

1:14:28.422 --> 1:14:29.757
to ruin my wedding.

1:14:38.891 --> 1:14:41.602
I'm not a fan of lace. What do you think?

1:14:43.270 --> 1:14:45.439
You're supposed to be
helping me choose a dress.

1:14:45.523 --> 1:14:49.068
We were already here.
Plus, drinks are free, Ana. C'mon.

1:14:49.151 --> 1:14:53.030
-Ema, I thought you already had a dress?
-It's always good to have options.

1:14:53.114 --> 1:14:56.450
-Am I showing too much cleavage?
-Can you even breathe?

1:14:56.534 --> 1:14:57.368
Of course.

1:15:00.746 --> 1:15:02.164
Don't look now,

1:15:02.540 --> 1:15:05.251
but there's a fucking stalker
at the window.

1:15:06.752 --> 1:15:08.629
-I'm going to get him!
-It's Gabriel!

1:15:09.380 --> 1:15:10.631
Your Gabriel?

1:15:10.965 --> 1:15:12.091
Yes.

1:15:12.842 --> 1:15:14.844
Here he comes!

1:15:17.888 --> 1:15:18.973
Did he leave?

1:15:19.056 --> 1:15:19.974
Here he is.

1:15:22.184 --> 1:15:23.102
Ana?

1:15:31.944 --> 1:15:32.778
How are you?

1:15:33.696 --> 1:15:34.572
Fine.

1:15:35.406 --> 1:15:36.574
What are you doing here?

1:15:36.657 --> 1:15:38.868
Just trying on my dress.

1:15:40.411 --> 1:15:41.704
Are you getting married?

1:15:43.456 --> 1:15:44.457
With whom?

1:15:45.166 --> 1:15:46.667
To a better man than you.

1:15:48.252 --> 1:15:49.795
-Do I know you?
-Babe?

1:15:53.257 --> 1:15:55.009
I'm ready. Shall we go?

1:15:55.342 --> 1:15:56.510
Hi, Ingrid.

1:15:59.096 --> 1:16:01.474
Is this the skank who stole your man?

1:16:01.557 --> 1:16:02.391
Excuse me?

1:16:03.350 --> 1:16:06.812
She has the worst bad breath! Gross!

1:16:06.937 --> 1:16:10.232
It's called halitosis. It's a sickness.

1:16:10.316 --> 1:16:13.402
Don't talk if you don't know about it.
Gabriel, can we leave?

1:16:13.861 --> 1:16:14.820
Let's go!

1:16:16.322 --> 1:16:18.783
-Why were you just standing there?
-Have a mint.

1:16:19.200 --> 1:16:20.868
Ana, do you want a sip?

1:16:21.160 --> 1:16:22.661
You look beautiful, Ana.

1:16:27.249 --> 1:16:29.043
Okay.

1:16:30.836 --> 1:16:33.339
-No, you're going to drink it all up.
-There's more.

1:16:33.422 --> 1:16:34.507
Everything's fine.

1:17:04.036 --> 1:17:05.329
What are you doing here?

1:17:06.747 --> 1:17:07.623
We need to talk.

1:17:17.299 --> 1:17:18.425
What do you want?

1:17:20.219 --> 1:17:22.888
I messed up, okay? I acted like an idiot.

1:17:23.305 --> 1:17:25.599
I thought I was over it,
but I saw you in the sh--

1:17:25.683 --> 1:17:28.018
Stop, Gabriel. I don't want to hear it.

1:17:31.188 --> 1:17:32.523
When you saw me in the shop?

1:17:33.107 --> 1:17:34.066
I miss you, Ana.

1:17:34.608 --> 1:17:35.943
I can't forget you.

1:17:36.026 --> 1:17:37.319
Oh, Gabriel.

1:17:38.404 --> 1:17:39.488
Why now?

1:17:39.947 --> 1:17:43.742
-Do you know how hard it was for me?
-I never meant to hurt you.

1:17:47.621 --> 1:17:49.290
I never should have let you go.

1:17:51.667 --> 1:17:54.420
-The way you smell.
-Vanilla oil.

1:17:54.503 --> 1:17:56.380
I love vanilla.

1:17:59.133 --> 1:18:01.385
Gabriel, I'm engaged.

1:18:02.052 --> 1:18:04.638
I don't care. So am I.

1:18:08.100 --> 1:18:09.268
What?

1:18:10.644 --> 1:18:11.729
What?

1:18:17.193 --> 1:18:18.527
Are you still with Ingrid?

1:18:19.904 --> 1:18:21.113
Yeah, so what?

1:18:23.657 --> 1:18:25.409
-No?
-Oh, Gabriel.

1:18:37.630 --> 1:18:38.714
Fine. I'll leave.

1:18:40.716 --> 1:18:42.843
If you change your mind, give me a call.

1:18:59.193 --> 1:19:00.611
What are you doing here?

1:19:04.114 --> 1:19:05.908
Shouldn't you be planning your wedding?

1:19:08.202 --> 1:19:10.371
Okay. This might take a while.

1:19:14.708 --> 1:19:16.835
I thought I wanted this,
but now I don't know.

1:19:16.919 --> 1:19:18.754
Or if I'm making a huge mistake.

1:19:20.589 --> 1:19:22.258
It's normal to have doubts.

1:19:23.175 --> 1:19:26.637
Once you're on your honeymoon,
this will be a thing of the past.

1:19:26.804 --> 1:19:28.013
I'm not so sure.

1:19:28.806 --> 1:19:30.432
I'm not sure because...

1:19:32.434 --> 1:19:34.853
Because I don't know
how to keep up with this...

1:19:35.854 --> 1:19:36.814
charade.

1:19:38.482 --> 1:19:40.192
Just do what you've been doing.

1:19:41.318 --> 1:19:44.405
You did what you had to do
to get what you wanted.

1:19:45.531 --> 1:19:47.408
Now it's time to enjoy it.

1:19:48.909 --> 1:19:50.911
Is it true you've been married
seven times?

1:19:52.079 --> 1:19:53.914
That's my story, Ana.

1:19:55.040 --> 1:19:56.041
Not yours.

1:19:58.836 --> 1:20:00.421
If you don't mind, I have a class.

1:20:16.562 --> 1:20:19.064
So, all of you are on a journey
to find a man.

1:20:20.649 --> 1:20:22.484
And what have you done to find him?

1:20:24.570 --> 1:20:25.696
How is it?

1:20:26.447 --> 1:20:27.740
-It's really good!
-Yes.

1:20:28.240 --> 1:20:31.452
I like this one more than the other two.

1:20:31.535 --> 1:20:33.746
-Okay.
-Let me try this one.

1:20:36.665 --> 1:20:38.375
Delicious. It's unbelievable.

1:20:38.459 --> 1:20:39.293
Hello.

1:20:39.835 --> 1:20:40.794
Hi, babe.

1:20:41.295 --> 1:20:42.421
Can we talk?

1:20:43.255 --> 1:20:44.298
Of course.

1:20:44.465 --> 1:20:45.632
But first, try this.

1:20:46.216 --> 1:20:47.468
Delicious, right?

1:20:48.510 --> 1:20:51.597
-What are you doing?
-Gross! It tastes too much like fish!

1:20:52.014 --> 1:20:53.849
Can you give us five minutes please?

1:20:55.517 --> 1:20:57.144
What is it? Do you feel sick?

1:20:57.519 --> 1:20:58.937
Is it your parents?

1:20:59.188 --> 1:21:01.190
-Is it hormones?
-No, it's not hormones.

1:21:01.273 --> 1:21:03.859
I'm sorry. So what is it?

1:21:05.778 --> 1:21:06.737
It's me.

1:21:07.863 --> 1:21:10.282
You deserve someone
much better than me.

1:21:10.407 --> 1:21:11.700
What are you saying?

1:21:12.159 --> 1:21:15.537
-Let's talk somewhere else.
-There's nothing to talk about.

1:21:17.664 --> 1:21:20.292
I'm sorry, but I don't think
we should get married.

1:21:22.586 --> 1:21:23.420
Ana.

1:21:25.464 --> 1:21:26.340
Ana, wait!

1:21:26.507 --> 1:21:28.425
What are you doing?

1:21:28.801 --> 1:21:29.635
Ana?

1:21:30.386 --> 1:21:31.428
Why are you running?

1:21:34.264 --> 1:21:36.141
Stop running, please!

1:21:39.770 --> 1:21:40.813
Don't run!

1:21:41.563 --> 1:21:42.398
Ana!

1:21:45.442 --> 1:21:48.362
This is ridiculous.
What are you doing? Stop!

1:21:49.446 --> 1:21:50.322
Ana!

1:21:50.656 --> 1:21:52.699
Wait. Where are you going?

1:21:54.034 --> 1:21:55.035
Wait.

1:21:56.036 --> 1:21:56.954
Ana, don't.

1:21:58.414 --> 1:22:02.209
-Ana, open the door.
-What for? I'm doing you a favor.

1:22:02.376 --> 1:22:04.837
I'm not leaving until we talk. Okay?

1:22:08.590 --> 1:22:09.550
Open up, Ana!

1:22:11.009 --> 1:22:12.136
Can you--

1:22:18.350 --> 1:22:19.184
All right.

1:22:19.977 --> 1:22:20.936
Can we talk?

1:22:24.148 --> 1:22:25.732
I get it that you're nervous.

1:22:26.817 --> 1:22:28.819
But we don't have to be like your parents.

1:22:30.863 --> 1:22:31.989
That's not it.

1:22:32.322 --> 1:22:33.365
Then, what is it?

1:22:37.077 --> 1:22:38.620
We're having a baby.

1:22:42.416 --> 1:22:44.501
No, we're not having a baby.

1:22:45.878 --> 1:22:47.421
What do you mean?

1:22:49.214 --> 1:22:50.424
You lost the baby?

1:22:55.512 --> 1:22:56.889
Ana, no.

1:23:01.059 --> 1:23:02.102
No.

1:23:11.945 --> 1:23:12.946
No.

1:23:13.822 --> 1:23:15.949
-We didn't lose the baby.
-What?

1:23:17.784 --> 1:23:19.786
Did we or didn't we?

1:23:20.329 --> 1:23:22.706
We didn't lose it because...

1:23:24.249 --> 1:23:25.959
there was never a baby.

1:23:26.835 --> 1:23:27.794
I made it up.

1:23:29.630 --> 1:23:31.215
I know it was wrong.

1:23:31.590 --> 1:23:32.966
It was very wrong.

1:23:34.760 --> 1:23:37.387
I didn't know what else to do
to get a ring.

1:23:47.731 --> 1:23:49.399
Please forgive me.

1:24:15.092 --> 1:24:17.135
Ana, what is it? What happened?

1:24:21.598 --> 1:24:24.434
I can't understand you.
I can't understand anything.

1:24:25.435 --> 1:24:26.311
Come inside.

1:24:29.356 --> 1:24:32.568
What's wrong now?
Did you get dumped again?

1:24:35.737 --> 1:24:37.573
I'll be in the bedroom.

1:24:38.365 --> 1:24:40.033
Calm down.

1:24:40.492 --> 1:24:42.995
Breathe.

1:24:43.620 --> 1:24:44.621
That's it.

1:24:45.247 --> 1:24:46.164
That's it.

1:24:49.501 --> 1:24:51.587
I've screwed up so much, Julia.

1:24:53.797 --> 1:24:55.591
All because I wanted to get married.

1:24:56.883 --> 1:25:00.220
I don't think it's a lost cause.
Why don't you call Diego?

1:25:00.637 --> 1:25:01.471
No.

1:25:03.098 --> 1:25:04.266
I ruined it.

1:25:06.893 --> 1:25:08.270
The worst part is...

1:25:10.272 --> 1:25:12.107
I think it would have worked with him.

1:25:13.233 --> 1:25:14.526
Oh, Ani.

1:25:16.236 --> 1:25:18.864
I'll never have the perfect life
you two have.

1:25:19.865 --> 1:25:21.408
What perfect life?

1:25:21.491 --> 1:25:22.534
Please, Julia.

1:25:22.909 --> 1:25:24.077
You and Emilio?

1:25:24.786 --> 1:25:27.331
You're like those couples in magazines.

1:25:28.206 --> 1:25:29.666
You have no idea.

1:25:30.042 --> 1:25:32.711
We haven't had sex in six months.

1:25:33.045 --> 1:25:34.254
-What?
-Six.

1:25:37.549 --> 1:25:39.843
Not even during my worst dry spell.

1:25:40.969 --> 1:25:42.638
-Thanks.
-Sorry.

1:25:42.804 --> 1:25:46.266
It's not like we're considering
a divorce or anything.

1:25:48.268 --> 1:25:50.812
We really love each other
and we're going to work it out.

1:25:52.648 --> 1:25:54.358
Why didn't you tell me anything?

1:25:56.443 --> 1:25:59.696
Because it's hard to talk to you
unless it's about you.

1:26:01.531 --> 1:26:03.950
Look how you reacted
to our parents' divorce.

1:26:04.785 --> 1:26:05.661
How are they?

1:26:06.411 --> 1:26:11.625
Dad found an apartment,
and Mom is selling the house.

1:26:11.708 --> 1:26:14.503
Their life is upside down,
but they'll be fine.

1:26:15.337 --> 1:26:16.755
Eventually.

1:26:18.715 --> 1:26:21.385
I'm sorry for being so selfish, Juls.

1:26:29.518 --> 1:26:30.644
-I'm here for you.
-Yes.

1:26:38.026 --> 1:26:39.069
You're so pretty.

1:26:39.778 --> 1:26:40.821
Really?

1:26:43.448 --> 1:26:46.785
Except for that disgusting monster snot.

1:26:46.868 --> 1:26:48.704
-It's so gross.
-Really?

1:26:49.663 --> 1:26:52.332
-Is it gone?
-No, it's watching me.

1:26:52.416 --> 1:26:54.418
-You're so gross.
-You are!

1:26:54.793 --> 1:26:56.670
You and your snot!

1:28:18.794 --> 1:28:22.088
Thanks to you, Ema,
I learned to watch chick flicks

1:28:22.255 --> 1:28:23.340
and enjoy them.

1:28:23.507 --> 1:28:26.426
I learned that concerts are better
when you're with someone.

1:28:26.593 --> 1:28:28.470
That there's nothing wrong with saying...

1:28:28.553 --> 1:28:29.763
-I love you.
-Is it free?

1:28:30.055 --> 1:28:31.431
-Tona...
-Is this seat taken?

1:28:32.599 --> 1:28:33.683
Thank you. Excuse me.

1:28:34.184 --> 1:28:37.062
Tona, I've always heard
that opposites attract.

1:28:37.521 --> 1:28:39.564
But I never believed it until I met you.

1:28:40.065 --> 1:28:44.110
You weren't what I was looking for,
and yet you couldn't be more perfect.

1:28:44.778 --> 1:28:47.656
Thanks for showing me
that love has no rules.

1:28:47.948 --> 1:28:51.952
May these be the first steps
into a happy life.

1:28:52.035 --> 1:28:54.037
I declare you man and wife.

1:28:54.329 --> 1:28:55.705
You may kiss the bride.

1:29:04.214 --> 1:29:06.591
How have you been?
Have you shaken off the blues?

1:29:06.675 --> 1:29:07.551
Yeah.

1:29:08.677 --> 1:29:11.137
-Have you heard from Diego?
-No, nothing.

1:29:11.221 --> 1:29:12.931
I hope he can forgive me someday.

1:29:14.140 --> 1:29:15.183
What will you do?

1:29:15.267 --> 1:29:18.186
-Go back to the workshop?
-No! I've had enough.

1:29:18.270 --> 1:29:21.231
-Even if you die single.
-Even if I die single.

1:29:21.314 --> 1:29:25.485
It was a sexist workshop.
I've aborted the mission.

1:29:25.569 --> 1:29:28.655
-It worked for me. I got my ring.
-You're getting married?

1:29:28.738 --> 1:29:31.116
Yeah! Let me introduce you.
Edmundo, sweetheart?

1:29:31.491 --> 1:29:33.285
He was just featured in <i>Forbes.</i>

1:29:34.160 --> 1:29:36.162
-Nice to meet you.
-This is Ana.

1:29:37.038 --> 1:29:38.623
-Congrats.
-Thank you.

1:29:38.707 --> 1:29:41.501
I hope this one works out better
than my previous marriages.

1:29:42.752 --> 1:29:45.255
He's so funny.
Would you like a drink, sweetie?

1:29:45.338 --> 1:29:47.591
-Sure.
-We'll be right back.

1:29:48.008 --> 1:29:50.176
-Excuse me.
-Go ahead.

1:29:51.428 --> 1:29:54.472
No kidding.
This will be his fourth marriage.

1:29:54.556 --> 1:29:55.724
What?

1:29:57.225 --> 1:29:58.727
What else is new?

1:29:58.977 --> 1:30:01.146
See the chubby guy
eating quesadillas?

1:30:02.981 --> 1:30:06.568
-He's gulping them down!
-He's my ex-husband, Lola!

1:30:06.651 --> 1:30:09.195
-Sorry.
-We're giving it another try.

1:30:09.279 --> 1:30:13.450
Maybe it's a mistake,
but we're making the most of it.

1:30:13.617 --> 1:30:16.745
We've done it three times in the bathroom.
That's why he's hungry.

1:30:17.829 --> 1:30:19.831
-Well, cheers!
-Cheers!

1:30:19.915 --> 1:30:22.334
-Hey. Me too, girls!
-Yeah!

1:30:22.417 --> 1:30:24.753
-You look lovely!
-Oh, thank you.

1:30:24.836 --> 1:30:26.922
Now I get why you kept
that dress on hold.

1:30:27.005 --> 1:30:29.716
Thank you, Ana. I'm so glad you came.

1:30:29.799 --> 1:30:32.218
-How about a photo?
-Yes, a photo!

1:30:32.302 --> 1:30:34.429
-Photo.
-Come here!

1:30:34.596 --> 1:30:38.475
-Look happy, girls!
-Why not sad?

1:30:38.558 --> 1:30:41.895
-Don't forget me!
-Ouch, easy!

1:30:41.978 --> 1:30:45.649
-You're squishing me.
-One, two, three!

1:30:46.024 --> 1:30:47.400
Smile!

1:31:21.059 --> 1:31:24.562
-Would you like to dance?
-Not right now, thanks.

1:31:24.729 --> 1:31:27.148
I'll be at the bar
if you change your mind.

1:31:27.357 --> 1:31:28.525
Okay.

1:31:29.734 --> 1:31:32.362
Come here, Ana!

1:32:24.247 --> 1:32:26.332
