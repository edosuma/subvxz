00:01.160 --> 00:04.164
This place is
under new management.

00:05.040 --> 00:07.441
<i>By order of the Peaky Blinders.</i>

00:07.720 --> 00:09.290
just write down "peace", right,

00:09.640 --> 00:13.964
between the Jews and the Italians.

00:14.280 --> 00:17.727
And war against the gypsies.

00:19.760 --> 00:21.330
<i>- I love him, Tom.</i>
<i>- I know.</i>

00:21.760 --> 00:24.570
That's why I'll keep him away
from the old business,

00:24.640 --> 00:26.165
put him charge of the new.

00:26.280 --> 00:27.930
<i>Some idiots
at the Marquis of Lorne.</i>

00:28.280 --> 00:30.647
Tried to stop me and Isaiah
from drinking, but it's all right.

00:30.760 --> 00:32.000
We fought them off.

00:32.320 --> 00:33.731
The Marquis, eh?

00:38.840 --> 00:40.251
What do we want with
a 1,000-guinea horse?

00:40.440 --> 00:42.761
When we make our move
on Sabini's racing pitches,

00:42.840 --> 00:45.446
<i>a good racehorse is a passport
to the owner's enclosure.</i>

00:45.640 --> 00:48.041
May Carleton.
I breed racehorses and train them.

00:54.280 --> 00:57.523
<i>I've made arrangements
with men I trust.</i>

00:58.000 --> 01:01.561
If I should die, then you will die.

01:28.880 --> 01:29.881
Thanks.

01:43.840 --> 01:45.080
Would you stop the noise?

01:56.640 --> 02:06.641
<b><font color="#004F8C">Ripped By mstoll</font></b>

02:10.440 --> 02:12.010
You working tonight?

02:13.440 --> 02:15.408
Not so much work as pleasure.

02:16.160 --> 02:18.640
Others are doing my work
for me tonight.

02:19.920 --> 02:20.921
Gentlemen, welcome!

02:21.000 --> 02:22.161
Welcome!

02:22.240 --> 02:23.401
Mr Solomon.

02:23.520 --> 02:24.931
You must be Arthur.

02:25.080 --> 02:26.570
- That is right.
-Arthur!

02:27.160 --> 02:29.083
- Arthur!
-Pleasure to meet you, sir.

02:29.160 --> 02:30.844
I've heard so much about you.

02:31.320 --> 02:33.846
Shalom. Let me just say.

02:34.720 --> 02:36.006
Shalom.

02:40.320 --> 02:41.446
For luck.

03:00.120 --> 03:02.805
You understand I'm the commanding
officer on this operation.

03:03.240 --> 03:05.049
You're here purely as an observer.

03:07.600 --> 03:09.045
Just do your duty.

03:11.280 --> 03:12.327
Dear Lord,

03:13.320 --> 03:17.325
for what we're about to receive
may the Lord make us truly grateful.

03:17.600 --> 03:18.806
Amen.

03:23.000 --> 03:24.081
Amen.

03:25.680 --> 03:26.681
Amen.

03:29.520 --> 03:33.241
Passover started off
way out there in the Far East,

03:33.320 --> 03:36.802
out in the sand, out in the desert,
where me forefathers come from.

03:37.040 --> 03:39.168
You know, the Jews, the brews,
whatever you want to call them.

03:40.720 --> 03:42.404
It started out
as a little speck on the horizon.

03:42.520 --> 03:43.521
Arthur, this ain't right.

03:43.600 --> 03:46.285
Billy, don't worry, mate, you know
what I mean? If you want, you can leave.

03:46.560 --> 03:48.961
If you need to go
to the little boys' room, you can leave.

03:49.040 --> 03:50.121
We going to open 'em in a minute.

03:50.240 --> 03:52.322
He's all right, he's all right,
Billy boy.

03:52.400 --> 03:53.447
- Do you want to leave?
-No, you're all right.

03:53.680 --> 03:55.489
- You want to stay?
-I'll stay.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.525
You stay there, then, treacle.

03:57.760 --> 04:01.526
Okay, so the pharaoh.
Have you heard of him?

04:01.640 --> 04:05.486
He kept my people,
the Jewish people, in slavery,

04:05.560 --> 04:08.006
for thousands and thousands of years.

04:08.080 --> 04:09.491
Persecuted race.

04:09.800 --> 04:12.724
He did, he persecuted my race.

04:12.960 --> 04:14.962
The killing of the innocent, right?

04:15.280 --> 04:18.204
<i>Seder, this feast,
that what we is having here.</i>

04:18.519 --> 04:23.651
<i>Seder is basically the day what
when the Jewish angels decided,</i>

04:23.720 --> 04:26.803
<i>you know, that the evil
fucking Egyptians</i>

04:26.880 --> 04:28.689
<i>had pushed their fucking luck!</i>

04:28.760 --> 04:29.921
<i>Right.</i>

04:30.000 --> 04:33.447
<i>It is part of our tradition
to do with Seder, right,</i>

04:33.560 --> 04:38.327
<i>that in order to make it good
with God to kill a king,</i>

04:40.000 --> 04:43.482
<i>we have to carry out the Korban Pesach.</i>

04:43.800 --> 04:45.290
- Right.
-That,

04:45.600 --> 04:49.730
is the ritual sacrifice
of the Passover goat.

04:54.680 --> 04:58.162
- It's a goat.
-Yeah, and we're gonna sacrifice it.

04:59.280 --> 05:04.411
<i>Tonight. That's part of the reason
why we have to shut the doors as well.</i>

05:04.960 --> 05:08.442
But this year we thought
we'd give the fucking goat a name.

05:08.720 --> 05:11.530
- You've named it?
-We fucking did, yeah.

05:11.840 --> 05:15.970
- They named the fucking goat.
-The evil fucking Egyptian pharaoh,

05:16.160 --> 05:17.685
-the fucking enemy.
-That's right.

05:17.760 --> 05:19.603
- You know what we called it?
-What did ya call him?

05:19.680 --> 05:20.727
Tommy Shelby.

05:38.640 --> 05:41.450
- Stay where you are!

05:44.800 --> 05:45.961
You're all fired.

05:46.160 --> 05:48.128
- Fuck you.

05:48.880 --> 05:51.724
- That's right, let's take a load off.

05:53.200 --> 05:54.247
So...

05:55.520 --> 05:57.602
And the evil Egyptian scum...

05:58.920 --> 06:00.809
...was finally cleansed,

06:01.120 --> 06:04.124
with the blood
of the Passover goat, mate.

06:11.920 --> 06:13.490
That's from Sabini.

06:14.880 --> 06:16.723
And tell your gypsy king...

06:18.240 --> 06:21.722
...whoever comes
down south, shall return north

06:22.280 --> 06:25.648
in many fucking pieces. Huh?

06:39.560 --> 06:42.962
This fucking animal. He come in here,
right, with a fucking gun and razor

06:43.040 --> 06:44.963
and he shot him in the face!

06:45.040 --> 06:47.008
And my lads, they restrained him.

06:47.280 --> 06:49.248
Look at him. He's dead. Is he dead?

06:49.800 --> 06:51.211
He's fucking dead!

06:51.560 --> 06:53.528
He wants arresting or something, right?

06:53.680 --> 06:55.284
Surely.

07:01.840 --> 07:05.845
Michael! You can't take him away again,
you can't take my son away!

07:06.240 --> 07:09.369
You come back here! No! No!

07:11.280 --> 07:12.441
Ow!

07:12.640 --> 07:15.564
Don't you fucking touch him!
Get off him!

07:16.000 --> 07:18.002
Don't say anything!
Tommy will get you out!

07:18.080 --> 07:19.081
Fuck!

07:19.160 --> 07:21.242
I'll be all right...

07:25.640 --> 07:30.487
You should know, that as of this night,
Tommy Shelby is finished.

07:44.760 --> 07:47.764
Mick? This is Thomas Shelby,
he's come to check up on his filly.

07:49.960 --> 07:51.246
Yes, I've heard about you.

07:52.960 --> 07:54.485
Mick is
the best horseman in England.

07:56.960 --> 07:59.122
He likes to waste money, I know that.

07:59.360 --> 08:01.010
According to the reports
I've been given,

08:01.080 --> 08:03.208
you're spending two pound a month
on worming powder.

08:03.560 --> 08:05.085
What? You want a horse with worms?

08:05.240 --> 08:07.129
Horses get worms from the water trough.

08:07.720 --> 08:09.848
Put goldfish in them,
they eat the worm eggs.

08:09.920 --> 08:11.001
Goldfish?

08:12.520 --> 08:14.522
- It'll be a gypsy thing, is it?
-No.

08:15.120 --> 08:16.406
It's an accounting thing.

08:17.320 --> 08:20.324
- Goldfish cost a penny each.
-Or you can win them at the fair.

08:24.320 --> 08:27.483
If you want, I'll dispense
with the vet altogether. Excuse me.

08:31.520 --> 08:33.363
Did you ever consider
a career in diplomacy?

08:38.240 --> 08:39.730
Hello, hello.

08:39.799 --> 08:40.881
How are you, eh?

08:41.280 --> 08:42.361
Goldfish, seriously?

08:42.799 --> 08:43.926
Yup.

08:44.480 --> 08:46.164
You people have a lot to learn.

09:04.240 --> 09:07.722
They asked me if I wanted a fire
in the guest bedroom.

09:10.120 --> 09:11.326
I said no.

09:13.880 --> 09:15.041
Just one fire tonight.

09:16.960 --> 09:18.405
Bold and fearless, eh?

09:19.040 --> 09:20.121
Yes.

09:21.800 --> 09:23.325
Though I'm not really fearless.

09:32.920 --> 09:35.241
- Drink?
-Why not?

09:48.920 --> 09:52.288
- Madam, there is a telephone call.
-I'll take it in the drawing room.

09:52.560 --> 09:53.971
It's for Mr Shelby.

09:57.960 --> 09:59.200
We had a deal.

10:00.440 --> 10:01.646
Hey!

10:02.440 --> 10:04.124
We had a fucking deal.

10:04.840 --> 10:08.322
I would thank you to moderate
your language in a place of worship.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.128
We had a fucking deal.

10:15.440 --> 10:16.566
Mr Shelby.

10:18.960 --> 10:20.724
If you read the papers,

10:21.720 --> 10:24.883
you might have seen that
the Home Secretary has got himself

10:24.960 --> 10:28.965
into a bit of a fizz
about certain moral issues.

10:29.440 --> 10:30.646
Prostitution.

10:31.120 --> 10:35.011
Protection, racketeering, drinking,
cocaine and, of course,

10:36.000 --> 10:37.411
gambling.

10:38.200 --> 10:39.725
And he's demanded results.

10:40.120 --> 10:42.566
You offered me protection.

10:42.720 --> 10:44.882
You promised me protection.

10:45.000 --> 10:49.528
Well, no, you see, it was Mr Churchill
that made you that promise.

10:50.800 --> 10:54.282
And the Home Secretary
outranks him, so...

10:56.400 --> 10:58.971
And I can hardly be blamed
if your demented brother

10:59.040 --> 11:02.283
decides to go on some sort
of blood orgy during dinner.

11:02.360 --> 11:03.441
Do not fucking lie to me.

11:03.560 --> 11:07.042
Do not sit here
in your fucking church and lie to me!

11:09.240 --> 11:13.529
You will need to contain your emotions
or this meeting is at an end.

11:22.520 --> 11:23.885
Good.

11:25.480 --> 11:27.005
That's better.

11:29.520 --> 11:30.521
So...

11:32.000 --> 11:35.482
Let us review the new situation.

11:35.800 --> 11:37.723
I have your brother in a prison cell,

11:37.960 --> 11:40.281
charged with the murder
of Billy Kitchen.

11:41.440 --> 11:43.408
The case against him is strong.

11:44.160 --> 11:47.642
And I have no doubt
that his destiny is to hang.

11:48.440 --> 11:50.727
And then there is Polly's son Michael.

11:51.040 --> 11:55.762
He has already admitted to helping
Arthur burn down the Marquis Pub.

11:57.160 --> 12:00.323
Oh, he was
a tough nut to crack, that boy.

12:00.400 --> 12:01.526
But crack he did.

12:02.320 --> 12:04.448
So I have your brother facing the noose.

12:04.520 --> 12:07.091
I have your cousin facing
five years for arson.

12:07.400 --> 12:11.962
And I have
your entire organisation in disarray

12:12.080 --> 12:13.764
in Birmingham and in London.

12:13.840 --> 12:15.001
What do you want?

12:16.400 --> 12:17.686
What do I want?

12:19.040 --> 12:20.280
I don't understand.

12:22.040 --> 12:23.280
I've already agreed

12:23.480 --> 12:25.642
to do your fucking killing for you.

12:26.960 --> 12:30.248
Now what is it you want from me?

12:30.680 --> 12:33.843
Oh. There you go, you see...

12:36.120 --> 12:40.489
An agreement is not the same thing
as an assurance, now, is it?

12:41.960 --> 12:44.281
See, I found that

12:45.240 --> 12:47.083
I wasn't sleeping so well.

12:49.000 --> 12:50.240
And it wasn’t just that...

12:50.520 --> 12:53.171
...the smell and the noise
in that room, no.

12:54.160 --> 12:57.448
It was the nagging doubt.
The knowledge.

12:58.240 --> 12:59.765
The knowledge that...

13:01.640 --> 13:04.325
Tommy Shelby is not afraid to die.

13:06.480 --> 13:08.164
And therefore,

13:09.000 --> 13:11.844
the threat to your own life
might not be enough

13:12.440 --> 13:17.082
to make it certain that
you will obey me on the given day.

13:19.280 --> 13:23.729
I needed also the power
of life and death over your family

13:24.000 --> 13:26.446
and that I now have.

13:27.000 --> 13:30.766
Your brother, your cousin
and your sister.

13:32.680 --> 13:37.083
I've known her address in Primrose Hill
since the day she moved in.

13:38.120 --> 13:41.602
Now she is safe only as long
as I want her to be.

13:42.800 --> 13:47.089
I've been ahead of you,
every step of the way.

13:48.600 --> 13:51.604
And, as my father used to say,

13:52.720 --> 13:56.566
to make sure your dog obeys you,
you have to show it the stick

13:57.120 --> 13:58.804
once in a while.

14:06.360 --> 14:09.489
Tommy, Arthur's in solitary confinement.
Michael's in remand wing...

14:09.560 --> 14:12.166
Yeah, I already know.
Get out, shut the doors.

14:27.160 --> 14:28.241
<i>Tommy?</i>

14:30.000 --> 14:31.161
<i>It's me.</i>

14:34.720 --> 14:35.801
Tommy, can you hear me?

14:37.160 --> 14:38.321
Yes, Grace.

14:39.400 --> 14:40.890
I think you called.

14:41.560 --> 14:42.846
I haven't slept.

14:45.640 --> 14:47.483
Grace, this is not a good time.

14:48.200 --> 14:49.406
<i>I can call you back.</i>

14:49.520 --> 14:51.602
- No, no, it's fine. It's all right.
-Can we meet?

14:53.640 --> 14:55.642
Yes, we'll meet.

14:56.520 --> 14:57.646
When?

15:01.400 --> 15:03.607
Grace, there are some things
I have to do first.

15:13.200 --> 15:14.440
John?

15:15.560 --> 15:17.961
Coppers have lifted
10 of our men in Camden town,

15:18.840 --> 15:20.205
the rest of them on the run.

15:20.360 --> 15:22.283
- Tom, they've taken Michael.
-Business first.

15:22.360 --> 15:25.330
- They took Michael last night.
-Polly, business first!

15:26.680 --> 15:27.681
John?

15:28.440 --> 15:29.680
They took all our whisky.

15:30.600 --> 15:32.443
So no doubt
they'll be supping that for Christmas.

15:33.560 --> 15:35.449
They've impounded all our vans,

15:35.560 --> 15:37.324
put their own locks on the warehouse.

15:39.120 --> 15:42.681
The Eden Club and all our pubs
have been raided by the coppers

15:43.240 --> 15:45.641
and handed back to Sabini and Solomons.

15:47.920 --> 15:50.241
The Black Country boys think
it was Arthur who killed Billy

15:50.320 --> 15:52.163
because that's what
the coppers told them.

15:52.960 --> 15:55.406
So there'll be no more free passes
for our whisky boats.

15:55.480 --> 15:57.084
I don't give a fuck about whisky.

15:57.160 --> 15:58.969
I don't give a fuck about Billy Kitchen.

15:59.320 --> 16:02.369
I want my son out of prison now.

16:02.440 --> 16:03.805
Thomas, I spoke to Johnny Dogs.

16:03.880 --> 16:05.644
This meeting should just be family.

16:05.720 --> 16:07.643
- I can help.
-It's family only, she's not blood.

16:07.720 --> 16:09.722
- Let her speak.
-Tommy! Or is this a business...

16:09.800 --> 16:10.847
Enough!

16:13.120 --> 16:14.724
Enough, Polly.

16:15.360 --> 16:16.600
Esme.

16:17.000 --> 16:19.128
I spoke to Johnny Dogs.
The Lees are kin.

16:19.200 --> 16:21.362
- The bloody Lees!
-They can give us men.

16:21.440 --> 16:23.249
We don't need more fucking men.

16:23.720 --> 16:26.769
It's men that have done
the damage. It's...

16:27.720 --> 16:31.406
It is men fighting like cockerels that
have put us here in the first place.

16:32.640 --> 16:35.120
Esme, I'll take up their offer.
We need men.

16:42.960 --> 16:46.681
If Michael ever gets out of prison,

16:47.360 --> 16:51.001
I am taking him away
from this family, for good.

16:53.960 --> 16:56.008
This life is bad.

16:59.920 --> 17:02.082
This life is all bad.

17:02.360 --> 17:04.681
- Aunt Pol, what are you doing?
-Shut up and walk.

17:13.720 --> 17:15.085
Thomas.

17:16.880 --> 17:19.201
Should I go and speak
to Queen Mary Lee at the Black Patch?

17:24.359 --> 17:25.646
Yes.

17:26.319 --> 17:28.209
She can give us soldiers
for a few nights.

17:28.359 --> 17:29.566
Mmm, good.

17:33.360 --> 17:36.091
John, go bring up the car.

17:56.760 --> 17:58.489
Imagine riding away, Thomas.

18:00.000 --> 18:01.923
Living the real life, you know?

18:03.280 --> 18:05.089
Your gypsy half is the stronger.

18:07.160 --> 18:08.764
You just want to ride away.

18:11.720 --> 18:13.882
France is the new place
for us, they say.

18:15.440 --> 18:17.408
Lot of metal lying around still.

18:18.120 --> 18:20.487
Guns and trucks
and spent shells and things.

18:22.200 --> 18:23.406
Then you go south.

18:24.880 --> 18:26.006
Saintes Maries.

18:27.160 --> 18:28.605
Where the Black Madonna is.

18:30.200 --> 18:32.089
My brothers go sometimes for the fair.

18:34.440 --> 18:35.851
It's like a home for us.

18:40.080 --> 18:42.208
They still let you get lost there.

18:54.080 --> 18:56.003
I've been to France, Esme.

18:57.960 --> 18:59.371
So has John.

19:01.200 --> 19:04.807
Now get your coat
and go with your husband.

19:15.000 --> 19:18.129
If you ever talk about getting
lost again, I'll cut you

19:19.720 --> 19:21.290
from this family.

19:31.120 --> 19:32.565
What family?

19:51.560 --> 19:53.210
- Come in.

19:58.440 --> 20:00.841
Ah. Polly.

20:03.000 --> 20:04.650
I've come to see my son.

20:06.120 --> 20:07.531
Close the door.

20:11.560 --> 20:14.928
I've just been conducting
an interrogation.

20:16.360 --> 20:18.203
It can be awfully hard on the hands.

20:19.080 --> 20:21.242
My son. Michael. Where is he?

20:21.960 --> 20:23.610
Do you think I need a shave?

20:26.000 --> 20:27.490
It's been a long day.

20:28.240 --> 20:29.810
I need a shave, don't you think?

20:32.200 --> 20:35.602
Well, maybe it can wait till later.

20:38.200 --> 20:42.046
Your son has been having
a hard time of it I'm told.

20:42.680 --> 20:45.160
And that is why I thought
that you and I together,

20:45.320 --> 20:48.483
we should do whatever we can
to get him freed.

20:49.760 --> 20:52.764
Now, I have a form here, a release form.

20:53.800 --> 20:55.325
With my signature,

20:56.040 --> 20:59.761
he can be freed
by tomorrow morning at dawn.

21:16.120 --> 21:17.326
So sign it.

21:20.560 --> 21:22.642
- He didn't do anything.
-"Sign it,

21:22.840 --> 21:25.730
"Mr Campbell. Please, sir."

21:27.120 --> 21:29.691
Something like that. That would be
a way to say that, wouldn't it?

21:31.920 --> 21:33.081
Now,

21:34.440 --> 21:38.206
what would prompt me
to do you such a favour, hmm?

21:40.880 --> 21:42.291
What do you want?

21:45.240 --> 21:46.321
Information?

21:46.440 --> 21:51.241
You mean inside information about
Tommy Shelby's criminal empire?

21:53.120 --> 21:54.531
With respect,

21:55.320 --> 21:58.210
I would say I know more
about Tommy's dealings than you do.

21:58.640 --> 22:02.122
He doesn't trouble the family with
Irish business for instance, does he?

22:02.360 --> 22:03.407
No.

22:04.360 --> 22:05.691
So, no.

22:07.120 --> 22:09.487
It's not information I need.

22:16.440 --> 22:18.488
What else could you give me

22:20.240 --> 22:22.163
in return for my signature?

22:24.040 --> 22:26.520
I'm talking about
a simple transaction here.

22:28.960 --> 22:30.769
I have a great curiosity.

22:32.640 --> 22:35.484
Like a magpie sees something,

22:37.840 --> 22:39.763
something shining in the mud.

22:41.760 --> 22:44.127
Oh, he has no need for the silver,

22:46.080 --> 22:47.650
but he takes it anyway.

23:14.440 --> 23:15.805
Sign the form.

23:16.520 --> 23:19.364
-"Please, sir."
-Please, sir.

23:22.920 --> 23:25.969
I will sign that form with this hand

23:27.640 --> 23:29.449
when I am finished.

23:29.880 --> 23:32.804
- It's a deal?
-It's a deal.

23:36.840 --> 23:39.650
- Don't cry.
-Oh, I can cry.

23:40.480 --> 23:41.766
So...

23:43.120 --> 23:44.929
That is what I want.

23:45.360 --> 23:47.328
I need you to cry.

23:49.200 --> 23:50.565
I will try.

23:53.640 --> 23:56.530
"I need a favour, Mr Campbell, sir.

23:56.880 --> 24:00.930
"And I will do anything,
anything in return."

24:01.080 --> 24:03.287
That's what you might have said. Hmm?

24:06.400 --> 24:08.164
I felt something

24:09.960 --> 24:12.008
when I had you up against that car.

24:12.200 --> 24:13.964
And you felt it too.

24:14.440 --> 24:18.331
Don't tell me you didn't,
Polly, because...

24:19.000 --> 24:21.685
Oh, and now you think you're...

24:22.960 --> 24:24.803
You're so respectable,

24:25.240 --> 24:27.846
with your son and your house

24:28.200 --> 24:33.161
and your maid, but I know
what you are, gypsy Fenian slut.

24:34.960 --> 24:37.691
Do you want to do it on the floor
or on the desk, Mr Campbell?

24:47.920 --> 24:49.729
Now you cry.

24:51.080 --> 24:52.650
You cry!

25:00.400 --> 25:02.767
Get out.
Get out.

25:04.760 --> 25:06.091
Get out!

25:06.640 --> 25:09.564
No. No! I want him free.

25:10.880 --> 25:12.405
I'll get him free.

25:16.640 --> 25:18.005
You don't need to shave.

25:20.240 --> 25:21.844
You don't need to do anything.

25:24.960 --> 25:27.281
A victory is just doing nothing as well.

25:28.760 --> 25:30.364
Doing it soft and gentle.

25:39.400 --> 25:41.482
Should I talk or not talk?

25:44.560 --> 25:47.450
Should it be like
I'm weak and small, yes?

25:50.920 --> 25:52.843
Do you want me to talk or not to talk?

25:55.600 --> 25:56.726
Talk.

25:57.280 --> 25:58.770
You're small and weak.

26:00.840 --> 26:01.966
That's what I am...

26:03.360 --> 26:05.044
Small and weak.

26:06.400 --> 26:07.811
Look.

26:13.760 --> 26:15.603
You made me cry.

26:20.200 --> 26:21.247
No!

26:22.960 --> 26:24.883
We had an agreement, right?

26:25.160 --> 26:26.924
Yes. Yes!

26:35.880 --> 26:37.006
Where have you been?

26:39.120 --> 26:41.202
Went to the Spotted Dog in Digbeth.

26:42.200 --> 26:43.440
A glass or two of rum.

26:45.680 --> 26:47.205
Was it one glass or two?

26:47.800 --> 26:49.040
It was three.

26:50.720 --> 26:51.846
Where's the baby?

26:53.280 --> 26:54.566
Sleeping.

26:56.120 --> 26:57.531
More like five.

27:02.720 --> 27:04.529
It was more like six.

27:06.840 --> 27:08.365
Did you meet the maid?

27:09.200 --> 27:11.885
Talked politics with her and
she got bored and went to bed.

27:16.560 --> 27:17.971
I phoned James.

27:18.560 --> 27:20.244
He talked to the lawyer anyway.

27:20.800 --> 27:22.802
Said he'd take Arthur's case for free,

27:23.000 --> 27:24.570
so we don't need Tommy.

27:28.560 --> 27:29.561
Pol?

27:30.800 --> 27:33.007
We'll get Michael free
as well, I promise.

27:33.600 --> 27:35.728
There's no need,
they'll let him out in the morning.

27:40.520 --> 27:43.126
If the baby wants anything at night,
ring the bell by the bed.

27:45.520 --> 27:48.444
She gets paid to work 24 hours,
that girl. She's getting lazy.

27:50.440 --> 27:51.805
Well...

27:54.200 --> 27:55.804
Take advantage if you're nice.

29:35.600 --> 29:37.728
You need cream on them cuts
or they'll go bad.

29:45.680 --> 29:47.330
The screws told me why I've been freed.

29:52.720 --> 29:54.131
They told me what you did.

30:01.240 --> 30:02.651
They thought it was funny.

30:10.360 --> 30:11.361
Maybe it is.

30:37.120 --> 30:38.849
What are you doing, Tommy?

30:40.080 --> 30:42.162
Shovelling shit, Curly.

30:42.280 --> 30:43.725
Just like you.

30:50.240 --> 30:51.571
Why're you doing that, Tommy?

30:51.640 --> 30:54.689
To remind meself what I'd be

30:54.760 --> 30:56.524
if I wasn't who I am.

31:27.760 --> 31:30.127
Tommy. What's going on?

31:30.200 --> 31:32.851
I think Tommy's lost his mind, Charlie.

31:34.920 --> 31:38.083
Well, it's honest work, Curly.

31:39.400 --> 31:41.448
But I don't want to get used to it.

31:42.520 --> 31:45.000
So I'll need six cans of petrol.

31:45.760 --> 31:47.683
Bring them to the garage.

31:48.360 --> 31:50.442
Put them in the back of the car.

31:50.880 --> 31:52.370
Six cans?

31:53.520 --> 31:54.681
Tommy.

31:55.120 --> 31:57.726
If you ever want a job,
I'll get you your own shovel.

31:59.480 --> 32:02.245
Petrol. Yes. Yeah.

32:53.240 --> 32:55.686
You're far too gorgeous
for some half-blind auntie.

32:56.880 --> 32:58.644
She's my harshest critic.

32:58.920 --> 33:00.410
I have to be perfect.

33:01.840 --> 33:03.922
She's not half-blind,
she's half-deaf.

33:05.160 --> 33:07.083
So what time will you be back?

33:07.400 --> 33:08.526
Before midnight.

33:10.240 --> 33:11.685
I'll be awake.

34:07.920 --> 34:09.251
Is this your house?

34:09.320 --> 34:10.481
Yes.

34:11.040 --> 34:12.485
Have a seat.

34:23.520 --> 34:25.123
Do I not get a drink?

34:25.840 --> 34:27.045
Please.

34:31.040 --> 34:33.121
- You want one?
-Yes.

34:33.440 --> 34:34.521
Still whisky?

34:36.000 --> 34:37.126
Yes.

34:38.080 --> 34:39.809
But other things have changed.

34:39.880 --> 34:41.609
I saw vans with your name on
at the docks.

34:41.679 --> 34:43.205
Yes, some things have changed.

35:01.440 --> 35:03.124
Tommy, I really wasn't sure
about coming tonight.

35:03.200 --> 35:05.248
I lit a fire in the bedroom upstairs.

35:06.800 --> 35:08.325
My plan was

35:08.400 --> 35:10.129
that we'd sit here for a while,

35:11.800 --> 35:13.484
talk about old times,

35:13.560 --> 35:14.925
drink some whisky.

35:18.080 --> 35:19.969
And I was gonna tell you

35:20.480 --> 35:21.606
I hadn't spent a day

35:21.680 --> 35:22.966
without thinking about you.

35:23.960 --> 35:25.530
And then we were gonna go upstairs

35:25.600 --> 35:27.045
and sleep together.

35:28.840 --> 35:31.684
But just now on the way
to opening the door,

35:32.200 --> 35:33.531
I changed me mind.

35:36.920 --> 35:38.570
So just have one drink

35:38.640 --> 35:40.130
tell me how happy you are in New York

35:40.200 --> 35:41.611
and then you can go.

35:41.680 --> 35:43.523
- You changed your mind?
-Mmm.

35:44.640 --> 35:45.721
So you can go.

35:46.800 --> 35:48.131
Well...

35:50.400 --> 35:51.401
As a matter of fact,

35:51.480 --> 35:52.845
I am happy in New York.

35:53.640 --> 35:54.801
And I am married.

35:54.880 --> 35:56.609
Oh, yeah, he's... He's rich. I know.

35:56.680 --> 35:57.966
And he's sweet.

35:58.400 --> 36:00.084
And he's kind to me.

36:00.640 --> 36:02.688
So what makes you think that
I would have gone to bed with you

36:02.760 --> 36:05.366
after one whisky and some conversation?

36:05.440 --> 36:07.124
I was accounting for three whiskys.

36:07.200 --> 36:08.565
How dare you?

36:09.080 --> 36:10.889
It doesn't matter now,
'cause I've changed me mind.

36:10.960 --> 36:13.201
I came here because you asked me.

36:13.720 --> 36:15.449
Even though he's sweet
and he's kind to you?

36:15.520 --> 36:16.965
And now I feel like an idiot.

36:17.040 --> 36:18.371
Well, then, go.

36:18.440 --> 36:19.646
Jesus.

36:31.240 --> 36:32.924
Well, you're still here.

36:37.240 --> 36:38.241
Are you so certain?

36:38.880 --> 36:40.689
That you're still in love with me?

36:42.400 --> 36:43.686
I was.

36:44.880 --> 36:46.006
But I'm not any more.

36:50.280 --> 36:51.884
You're not armed, Grace, are you?

36:52.280 --> 36:53.805
No, I'm not armed.

36:55.320 --> 36:58.324
I don't carry guns.
I don't have to.

37:04.480 --> 37:06.687
You don't have a sense of humour
any more, either.

37:06.800 --> 37:08.450
What are you talking about?

37:18.440 --> 37:21.683
The thing is, I hate reunions.

37:22.520 --> 37:24.602
I didn't want to sit here
for hours talking about nothing

37:24.680 --> 37:27.490
and dancing around
what we really want to say.

37:28.480 --> 37:29.845
So now,

37:30.920 --> 37:32.081
I know you're happy in New York.

37:32.160 --> 37:34.322
I know your husband's rich
and sweet and kind to you.

37:34.400 --> 37:36.402
I know you're unarmed.

37:37.040 --> 37:40.442
And you didn't come here for sex
because you don't love me any more.

37:41.960 --> 37:43.724
And it's only three minutes past.

37:45.960 --> 37:47.371
Another drink?

37:50.880 --> 37:52.484
I'll take that as a yes.

37:55.280 --> 37:57.760
It's good to see you, Grace.

38:00.000 --> 38:01.889
So you didn't light the fire?

38:06.160 --> 38:07.924
You see, my real plan

38:10.280 --> 38:11.884
was that we go out.

38:13.680 --> 38:15.170
I want to impress you.

38:16.120 --> 38:17.360
Now,

38:19.040 --> 38:20.804
do you like Charlie Chaplin?

38:23.640 --> 38:24.971
Yes, I like Charlie Chaplin.

38:25.440 --> 38:26.521
Good.

38:27.760 --> 38:30.047
I bet you've never heard
Charlie Chaplin speak.

38:32.920 --> 38:34.570
I thought you were taking me
to see Charlie Chaplin.

38:34.640 --> 38:35.687
I am.

38:35.760 --> 38:38.650
- This isn't a picture house.
-No, it's not a picture house.

38:38.720 --> 38:41.769
So how will
I see Charlie Chaplin?

38:41.880 --> 38:44.850
You will see him and you will hear him,
just like I promised.

38:46.040 --> 38:47.724
There you go. There's Chaplin.

38:47.800 --> 38:49.404
- Oh, my God. That's him.
-Mmm-hmm.

38:49.480 --> 38:51.005
That's really Charlie Chaplin in person.

38:51.080 --> 38:54.129
Yep. He's in England
promoting his film.

38:54.200 --> 38:55.690
And how the hell
do you know Charlie Chaplin?

38:55.760 --> 38:58.570
I don't.
I know his bodyguard, Wag McDonald.

38:59.240 --> 39:00.844
It's that chap there.

39:01.040 --> 39:03.725
Wag was a bookie in Birmingham,
then he went to Los Angeles.

39:04.240 --> 39:06.368
You see, Wag is also Romani gypsy,

39:06.440 --> 39:08.647
as is Chaplin, but he keeps it a secret.

39:09.400 --> 39:12.483
Chaplin was born on the Black Patch,
a gypsy camp in Birmingham.

39:13.200 --> 39:16.363
That's why he gave Wag the job,
even though Wag was on the run.

39:16.440 --> 39:17.726
Thank you.

39:19.920 --> 39:22.446
Thank you.
See, we all have our secrets, Grace.

39:23.440 --> 39:25.522
Come on. I'll introduce you.

39:28.760 --> 39:31.923
Hello, Wag.
Mr Chaplin, this is Grace.

39:32.560 --> 39:34.562
Hello, Mr Chaplin.

39:42.240 --> 39:44.561
- Hello.
<i>- Hello, Mr Campbell.</i>

39:44.760 --> 39:48.162
<i>Uh, you said you knew
my sister's address in Primrose Hill,</i>

39:48.560 --> 39:50.688
<i>so I expect you have men
watching the house,</i>

39:50.760 --> 39:52.364
<i>see who comes and goes.</i>

39:53.320 --> 39:55.800
Well, tonight your men
will see me return to the house

39:55.880 --> 39:57.484
with a very beautiful woman.

39:58.040 --> 40:00.646
She will stay
until just before midnight.

40:01.080 --> 40:03.287
Of course, I'll close the curtains.

40:04.760 --> 40:06.046
Can you guess who the woman is?

40:09.440 --> 40:10.487
Liar!

40:10.600 --> 40:12.284
Sleep well, Mr Campbell.

40:22.320 --> 40:23.810
Tommy.

40:25.480 --> 40:27.209
Tommy, do you have someone?

40:35.440 --> 40:37.124
It's too late, Tommy.

40:38.160 --> 40:39.685
It's 11:00, Grace.

40:39.760 --> 40:41.444
I mean, it's too late.

40:44.760 --> 40:46.569
If you'd come with me to New York...

40:47.480 --> 40:49.164
I have things to do.

40:51.600 --> 40:53.967
You mean the coin landed the wrong way?

40:55.480 --> 40:57.289
It couldn't have worked.

40:58.920 --> 41:00.524
That was a question.

41:11.720 --> 41:12.881
Hey.

41:13.320 --> 41:15.402
Tommy, do you have someone?

41:18.760 --> 41:20.410
I have a racehorse.

41:21.680 --> 41:23.921
She's gonna win the derby.

42:18.080 --> 42:20.287
I'll drive you.

42:25.000 --> 42:26.525
When do you sail back?

42:29.280 --> 42:30.691
We don't know yet.

42:32.280 --> 42:34.009
You don't have a return ticket?

42:35.280 --> 42:37.044
This wasn't right, Tommy.

42:38.560 --> 42:40.403
When do you go back, Grace?

42:45.680 --> 42:47.364
They're doing tests on us.

42:47.720 --> 42:49.688
I don't know when they'll be finished.

42:54.280 --> 42:55.850
We're having treatment.

42:56.960 --> 42:58.689
A doctor on Harley Street.

42:59.720 --> 43:01.563
Some new thing, a breakthrough.

43:05.080 --> 43:06.809
We're trying for a baby.

43:31.480 --> 43:33.562
Why did you come here tonight?

43:39.960 --> 43:42.645
The doctor believes
it's surely me who's at fault.

43:45.560 --> 43:46.721
I'm sorry.

43:50.560 --> 43:51.641
It's no one's fault.

43:51.720 --> 43:53.848
I'm tired of that, Tommy.

44:05.400 --> 44:06.845
Can I see you again?

44:11.320 --> 44:12.560
Grace.

44:17.800 --> 44:20.087
You're used to working undercover, eh?

44:22.360 --> 44:24.442
I've never lied to him once.

44:27.360 --> 44:29.044
So tell him the truth.

44:48.360 --> 44:49.725
Put your arms up.

44:58.040 --> 45:00.168
Oh, what've we got here then?

45:04.960 --> 45:06.325
Get your fuckin' hands off me.

45:08.440 --> 45:09.771
Oh, here he is.

45:10.000 --> 45:11.843
The King of London Town.

45:21.760 --> 45:23.046
You been enjoying yourself?

45:23.120 --> 45:24.565
Oh, yeah, it's fucking great.

45:25.560 --> 45:27.722
Surrounded by Sabini's men.

45:28.000 --> 45:29.445
Rats everywhere.

45:30.280 --> 45:31.850
Fucking cockneys.

45:33.000 --> 45:35.162
Well, at least you're going
to get what you've always wanted.

45:35.760 --> 45:36.761
And what's that?

45:36.840 --> 45:39.002
Well, you tried to hang yourself twice.

45:39.080 --> 45:40.684
Now the King is gonna do it for you.

45:45.040 --> 45:47.247
- I've been a fuckin' idiot.
-Yeah.

45:49.200 --> 45:50.929
I haven't appreciated nothing, John.

45:51.000 --> 45:52.490
Are you fucking repenting or something?

45:52.560 --> 45:53.925
Drawing.

45:54.760 --> 45:55.841
I used to be good at drawing.

45:55.920 --> 45:58.491
Arthur, please, for God's sake,
I don't need this.

45:58.560 --> 46:00.289
I should have listened more in class.

46:00.360 --> 46:02.806
What fucking class?
You were never there.

46:04.120 --> 46:05.963
I used to draw horses.

46:06.480 --> 46:08.482
- Arthur...
-Stallions.

46:08.760 --> 46:10.410
- Great big ones.
-Arthur.

46:10.520 --> 46:12.966
- They looked real.
-Not stallions. Not now.

46:13.720 --> 46:16.326
I should have done more
with me life, John.

46:16.760 --> 46:18.649
- Good things.
-Arthur, for God's sake...

46:18.720 --> 46:19.960
Even Ada said it wasn't my fault.

46:20.040 --> 46:21.371
Arthur, will you listen?

46:21.440 --> 46:24.250
- They're gonna hang me, John.
-They're not gonna hang you.

46:24.320 --> 46:25.651
Says who?

46:27.480 --> 46:28.925
Tommy.

46:32.400 --> 46:35.006
And how is Houdini
gonna get me out of this?

46:35.240 --> 46:37.971
- Well, we...
-Don't tell me. He's got a plan.

46:38.800 --> 46:40.609
But you don't know
what that plan is, do you, John?

46:40.680 --> 46:41.761
I do...

46:41.840 --> 46:43.569
'Cause we just can't be trusted.

46:44.200 --> 46:45.406
All right.

46:45.640 --> 46:48.371
If he's so fucking clever,
why am I in here?

46:48.440 --> 46:49.566
Well, it's...

46:49.640 --> 46:52.450
Why is all our men
and half our whisky been lifted?

46:52.840 --> 46:53.966
Hmm?

46:54.200 --> 46:56.168
The Jew and the cockney
have run rings round him.

46:56.240 --> 46:57.969
- Will you shut up?
-Look at you. Look.

46:58.960 --> 47:02.089
- A big fucking man...
-Fucking shut up!

47:04.680 --> 47:06.762
He's already told me
what I've got to do.

47:24.600 --> 47:26.682
What business have you got here?

47:26.840 --> 47:28.205
I just pulled over.

47:28.280 --> 47:30.681
I never smoke and drive, you know?

47:30.760 --> 47:32.842
- Where are you from?
-I'm from Ireland,

47:33.600 --> 47:35.807
the beautiful north
where the rocks sing in the wind.

47:35.880 --> 47:37.484
Yeah, in the beautiful north.

47:38.000 --> 47:39.286
You know,
I've just pulled over for a fag.

47:39.360 --> 47:41.169
I want to see some identification!

47:41.680 --> 47:42.841
Hey!

48:23.320 --> 48:24.401
Look.

48:24.960 --> 48:26.007
Come!

48:29.680 --> 48:30.727
See?

48:35.000 --> 48:38.049
Does it really stop the horses
from getting worms?

48:38.480 --> 48:40.403
Yep. It really does.

48:46.040 --> 48:48.361
Anyway, I thought
it would make you smile.

48:50.360 --> 48:51.805
I'm sorry that you had
to drive through the night.

48:51.880 --> 48:54.645
You must be exhausted.
You can go and sleep if you want.

48:56.760 --> 48:57.921
May.

48:59.920 --> 49:01.570
We have to stop.

49:02.200 --> 49:03.361
This.

49:04.800 --> 49:07.167
I came here
to tell you we have to stop.

49:09.720 --> 49:10.721
Why?

49:11.840 --> 49:14.002
Because I'm me and you're you,
that old thing?

49:15.200 --> 49:16.406
There's someone.

49:19.720 --> 49:21.210
For a long time.

49:26.240 --> 49:28.049
And I didn't want you to think
anything about how

49:28.120 --> 49:30.202
it's gonna be after the race.

49:35.360 --> 49:36.805
Not many of your people know about me,

49:36.880 --> 49:39.611
so I haven't done
the damage that would come.

49:39.720 --> 49:40.926
"My people?"

49:43.840 --> 49:45.649
Well, the damage isn't done,

49:45.800 --> 49:47.211
is what I mean.

49:47.280 --> 49:48.725
- Right.
-It's...

49:51.200 --> 49:54.044
Even if it's like this,
I want the horse to stay here.

49:54.400 --> 49:56.084
To stay? Yes, of course.

49:56.160 --> 49:57.366
Epsom is close.

49:57.440 --> 49:59.807
I haven't got my outfit yet
so it's all right.

50:01.040 --> 50:03.088
You can still be
with me at the enclosure.

50:03.160 --> 50:04.685
That's very gracious of you, sir.

50:05.600 --> 50:06.681
You can wear something.

50:06.800 --> 50:07.801
It's funny, isn't it?

50:07.880 --> 50:10.645
Because you'll be up there
and I'll be down in the ring.

50:11.720 --> 50:13.449
Sort of upside down, isn't it?

50:14.480 --> 50:17.245
You can still be with me after
and you can still wear something.

50:17.320 --> 50:19.209
I'll be covered in mud from the ring.

50:22.360 --> 50:24.328
May, forget about men like me.

50:24.400 --> 50:26.164
I was going to tell you
how much he's improved.

50:32.200 --> 50:33.440
There are other men, May.

50:33.520 --> 50:36.410
I think she stands
a chance of placing, so...

50:36.600 --> 50:37.761
That's the silly part
of our business done.

50:37.840 --> 50:39.922
Are you going to drive
straight off to Birmingham? Or...

50:46.040 --> 50:48.168
And what if I said, uh,

50:48.360 --> 50:51.330
"All right, I'll stay,"
after what I just said?

50:57.760 --> 50:59.603
Then that would be all right.

51:05.200 --> 51:07.009
You talk about damage.

51:07.280 --> 51:08.406
The damage not yet done.

51:08.480 --> 51:09.720
You don't think that half
of London already thinks

51:09.800 --> 51:11.131
that I'm fucking a racketeer?

51:12.600 --> 51:15.490
Laughing about it. Laying on bets
about when you'll steal the silver.

51:18.360 --> 51:20.931
You think your people are ruthless?
Try mine.

51:24.960 --> 51:27.201
So that's why you carry on, eh?

51:27.800 --> 51:29.723
Because you can't back down.

51:31.480 --> 51:34.370
Amongst many other illogical reasons.

51:38.600 --> 51:40.409
So will you drive straight off or...

51:40.480 --> 51:43.131
I haven't got any petrol in the garage.

51:46.920 --> 51:49.048
Yeah. I have some cans
of petrol in the car.

51:49.120 --> 51:50.849
Good. So you can go.

52:20.040 --> 52:21.530
They look happy in there, eh?

52:23.720 --> 52:24.960
And why wouldn't they be?

52:38.440 --> 52:39.805
Who is she?

52:41.960 --> 52:44.008
Someone who's sailing away.

52:53.240 --> 52:54.651
So let her sail.

52:58.400 --> 52:59.765
You've told me about her
like a gentleman.

52:59.840 --> 53:01.763
Now kindly behave like a gangster again.

53:07.040 --> 53:09.202
Feel sorry for me. It's fine.

53:19.760 --> 53:21.922
Because your horse
will come fifth or sixth.

53:23.880 --> 53:25.530
But I will win you.

53:33.680 --> 53:37.685
Mr Shelby’s just parking his car.
He said for you to wait in here.

53:42.560 --> 53:44.403
Isn't this impressive?

53:45.400 --> 53:48.165
And what is it you exactly do here?

53:49.640 --> 53:52.849
I exactly am a secretary to Mr Shelby.

53:52.920 --> 53:55.207
A secretary? My, my, my.

53:56.560 --> 53:58.085
All that paperwork.

54:00.560 --> 54:01.846
Do you want tea?

54:02.520 --> 54:03.521
No.

54:49.400 --> 54:51.801
I keep everything locked up,
Mr Campbell.

54:51.920 --> 54:53.445
Everything of value.

55:01.840 --> 55:03.524
Take a seat.

55:08.120 --> 55:10.771
How is your company treasurer, Polly?

55:13.040 --> 55:17.045
- Why do you ask?
-Oh, just give her my regards.

55:27.760 --> 55:30.445
You like to play with fire,

55:30.920 --> 55:32.445
don't you, Mr Shelby?

55:34.120 --> 55:36.885
Yesterday in Belgravia,

55:37.920 --> 55:40.890
Field Marshal Russell's
house was burnt out.

55:40.960 --> 55:43.531
An incendiary device was
put through his letterbox,

55:43.600 --> 55:44.886
which means

55:46.240 --> 55:48.811
that he will have to find
somewhere else to live

55:49.080 --> 55:50.764
for at least the next three months.

55:51.280 --> 55:52.486
Hmm.

55:53.200 --> 55:55.806
Which also means that your plan,

55:55.880 --> 55:57.803
for me to break in
and shoot him in his bed,

55:57.880 --> 56:00.121
is now no longer
an operational possibility.

56:00.200 --> 56:01.486
Indeed.

56:01.760 --> 56:05.731
But if you think a wee burn
frees you from your obligations,

56:05.800 --> 56:08.849
-think again.
-I will keep my side of the bargain.

56:09.080 --> 56:10.127
Oh, by God, you will.

56:10.200 --> 56:11.645
I will shoot your field marshal,

56:11.720 --> 56:14.326
but I will do it in a way
that serves my purpose.

56:14.400 --> 56:16.323
The only purpose is my purpose.

56:16.400 --> 56:19.449
I will carry out your assassination
at a place of my choosing.

56:21.680 --> 56:23.091
Listen to me.

56:23.880 --> 56:27.009
All operational detail
must be mutually agreed.

56:27.080 --> 56:29.811
I'm a soldier. I've experience.
I will determine where and when he...

56:29.880 --> 56:33.282
Now that man has 24-hour
armed police protection...

56:33.360 --> 56:35.124
Your plan was full of holes.

56:35.200 --> 56:36.804
My plan was mutually agreed!

56:36.880 --> 56:38.769
Well, now your plan is up in smoke.

56:39.280 --> 56:41.886
And I have formulated
the only viable alternative.

56:42.400 --> 56:44.164
Oh, for God's sake, what do you mean?

56:45.680 --> 56:47.444
How would you get to him?

56:49.840 --> 56:52.207
I won't.
He will come to me.

56:56.800 --> 56:58.723
Now, listen to me, Mr Shelby.

56:59.080 --> 57:00.969
When this meeting is concluded,

57:01.120 --> 57:04.442
I must report directly
to Mr Winston Churchill.

57:05.120 --> 57:08.522
Your relationship with Mr Churchill
is not my concern.

57:09.520 --> 57:13.525
And Mr Winston Churchill
will need to hear detail.

57:14.000 --> 57:16.207
Well, you tell him
he'll have to trust me.

57:20.480 --> 57:22.767
Look, Mr Campbell.

57:23.160 --> 57:25.322
I will carry out my mission.

57:25.840 --> 57:27.001
- Good.
-Good.

57:28.200 --> 57:30.601
But I will do it in a place
where it will be impossible

57:30.680 --> 57:34.810
for you or your men
to have me shot afterwards.

57:36.880 --> 57:38.484
Because that was the plan.

57:39.160 --> 57:40.161
Eh?

57:40.520 --> 57:42.727
Coppers front and back. No way out.

57:42.920 --> 57:44.968
Me shot dead, dumped in the Thames.

57:45.440 --> 57:46.885
I will do the killing,

57:47.360 --> 57:49.601
but at a place
where that will not be an option.

57:52.120 --> 57:55.761
I've recently become
a racehorse owner, Mr Campbell.

58:00.520 --> 58:01.806
It's, uh...

58:03.680 --> 58:06.047
Well, perhaps you can guess
which one is my horse.

58:24.360 --> 58:26.169
Where and when?

58:28.680 --> 58:29.806
Epsom.

58:30.920 --> 58:32.001
Derby Day.

58:36.920 --> 58:46.901
