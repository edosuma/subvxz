32:15.334 --> 32:17.167
What do you want?

32:24.977 --> 32:28.111
I want to be the president
of the united states.

32:28.113 --> 32:30.380
I want to run the world.

32:32.384 --> 32:35.252
[ sighs ]

32:40.125 --> 32:41.692
[ sighs ]

32:49.201 --> 32:51.001
So...

32:53.205 --> 32:55.372
Andrew walks.

32:57.209 --> 32:59.409
Okay, then.

33:04.049 --> 33:06.183
Okay.

33:12.291 --> 33:14.758
I don't think
i've ever been in here.

33:14.760 --> 33:17.127
Mm.

33:17.129 --> 33:18.762
It was
harrison's office.

33:18.764 --> 33:21.765
Before that,
it was stephen's office.

33:21.767 --> 33:23.767
I always think
it feels like it's...

33:23.769 --> 33:27.070
Full of ghosts
or something.

33:27.072 --> 33:29.439
Whatever.

33:29.441 --> 33:32.342
Huck still working on
the password gustavo gave him?

33:32.344 --> 33:34.644
Quinn.

33:34.646 --> 33:36.279
I know what
you're going to say,

33:36.281 --> 33:38.015
So you don't
have to tell me.

33:38.017 --> 33:41.485
Huck did something
unspeakably violent.

33:41.487 --> 33:44.688
Lots of blood, probably
some butchering, severed limbs.

33:44.690 --> 33:46.523
He likes [inhales deeply]
severed limbs.

33:46.525 --> 33:48.458
Looks like a horror film,
right?

33:48.460 --> 33:50.627
That's normal.
He's fine.

33:50.629 --> 33:53.130
He's not fine, quinn.
Of course not.

33:53.132 --> 33:54.464
Liv's gone.
He's not fine.

33:54.466 --> 33:57.200
He's<i> going</i> to be fine.

33:57.202 --> 33:58.635
I've seen
this kind of thing before.

33:58.637 --> 34:00.387
No, you've never seen
anything like this.

34:00.388 --> 34:02.138
<i>I've</i> never seen anything
like it, and i've seen a lot.

34:02.141 --> 34:04.441
He goes to dark places.
I know that.

34:04.443 --> 34:06.777
I have the dental bills
to prove it.

34:06.779 --> 34:09.413
But he pulls himself back.

34:09.415 --> 34:11.448
At some point,
before it's too late,

34:11.450 --> 34:13.150
Huck<i> always</i>
pulls himself back.

34:16.055 --> 34:17.087
And what if he doesn't?

34:17.088 --> 34:18.120
Quinn, i can't
just let him loose to --

34:18.123 --> 34:20.057
He is going to be fine.

34:20.059 --> 34:22.526
I'm in.
Gustavo's password worked.

34:22.528 --> 34:24.428
Are we bidding?
Not yet.

34:24.429 --> 34:26.329
They're gonna scan me
for marie wallace's
digital footprint.

34:26.331 --> 34:27.831
She needs
a browser history.

34:27.833 --> 34:30.400
What now?
Now i make
the perfect fake i.D.

34:30.402 --> 34:32.536
Now i build
marie wallace's bitstream,

34:32.538 --> 34:34.838
Her cash, the metadata.

34:34.840 --> 34:36.273
Now i hack.

34:36.274 --> 34:37.707
<i>Then</i> we're in,
and bidding begins.

34:44.183 --> 34:45.682
Okay.

34:47.719 --> 34:49.119
We're officially bidding
in the auction

34:49.121 --> 34:51.788
For olivia pope
as marie wallace.

34:51.790 --> 34:53.156
Quinn:
Where's the bidding at?

34:53.158 --> 34:54.791
[ computer beep ]
$1.1 billion.

34:54.793 --> 34:57.461
One of the mexican drug cartels
just dropped out.

34:57.463 --> 34:58.862
So, we're down
to eight bidders.

34:58.864 --> 35:00.730
Thank you, los zetas.
Thank you for dropping out.

35:00.732 --> 35:02.032
<i>Gracias.</i>
Wait, something's wrong.

35:02.034 --> 35:03.300
The numbers
aren't going up.

35:03.302 --> 35:04.301
That could be
a good thing.

35:04.302 --> 35:05.301
That's not a good thing.
It could be.

35:05.304 --> 35:06.803
[ beeping ]
it's not!

35:06.805 --> 35:08.338
Was that someone else
dropping out?

35:08.340 --> 35:09.773
That was everything
dropping out. It's gone.

35:09.775 --> 35:11.641
What do you mean?
It's just gone.

35:11.643 --> 35:13.210
What do you mean
it's gone?

35:13.211 --> 35:14.778
The auction -- it's gone.
It's been suspended.

35:14.780 --> 35:16.313
Why would they suspend
the auction?

35:16.315 --> 35:17.447
What happens to olivia?

35:20.519 --> 35:22.853
[ sighs ]

35:22.855 --> 35:25.489
Sir?

35:27.493 --> 35:29.626
Mr. President.

35:37.469 --> 35:39.836
Mr. President.

35:39.838 --> 35:42.405
Shh! Stop. Stop it!

35:42.407 --> 35:44.875
We drank a little too much
last night.

35:44.877 --> 35:48.145
Just once,
can't you let him sleep in?

35:48.147 --> 35:51.314
You know how much pressure
he's been un--

35:55.254 --> 35:56.586
Fitz.

35:56.588 --> 35:59.356
Fitz, wake up right now.

35:59.358 --> 36:01.491
What?

36:01.493 --> 36:03.660
Sir, you're needed in the
situation room, mr. President.

36:03.662 --> 36:05.896
What is it?
What's happened?

36:05.898 --> 36:07.564
Gus: Wake up, olivia!
[ gasps ]

36:10.869 --> 36:12.569
You've been sold.
It's time to go.

36:12.571 --> 36:14.905
But...

36:14.907 --> 36:18.208
The auction's not over
for another 12 hours.

36:18.210 --> 36:20.377
Oh, i know.
That's what's so great.

36:20.379 --> 36:22.679
These buyers came to me
directly, offering cash.

36:22.681 --> 36:25.382
Cold, hard,
roll-around-in-bed-on-it cash.

36:25.384 --> 36:27.884
So the auction's suspended,

36:27.886 --> 36:31.288
And your buyers are
oh-so-excited by their purchase.

36:31.290 --> 36:33.323
Who?

36:33.325 --> 36:36.259
Who did you sell me to?

36:36.261 --> 36:38.328
You're gonna<i> love</i> this.

36:40.399 --> 36:41.831
Iran.

36:45.571 --> 36:48.538
You smashed my head open and
then you killed my best friend.

36:48.540 --> 36:52.309
Who'd you think
i was gonna sell you to?

36:58.383 --> 36:59.549
Sold?
I'm afraid so,
mr. President.

36:59.551 --> 37:00.684
There was a buyer
outside of the auction.

37:00.686 --> 37:02.452
Who?
Iran.

37:05.424 --> 37:07.474
How much time
do we have?

37:07.475 --> 37:09.525
We believe transfer is imminent.
Mr. President --

37:09.528 --> 37:10.961
I want to see
the extraction plan.

37:10.963 --> 37:12.929
We don't believe we can
extract the asset at this time.

37:12.931 --> 37:14.598
In light
of these developments,

37:14.600 --> 37:16.433
We need to consider
other options.

37:16.435 --> 37:18.802
There are no other options
than extraction.

37:18.804 --> 37:20.904
Olivia pope is a former
high-level white house official.

37:20.906 --> 37:22.339
She maintains
a top-secret clear--

37:22.341 --> 37:24.841
There are no other options
than extraction.

37:24.843 --> 37:27.644
Ms. Pope's vast knowledge
of united states intelligence

37:27.646 --> 37:29.879
Poses an ongoing threat
to national security.

37:29.881 --> 37:32.515
Standard protocol
in this situation

37:32.517 --> 37:34.651
Is to neutralize the asset.

37:34.653 --> 37:37.954
We are not
neutralizing the asset!

37:37.956 --> 37:39.756
We get her out of there.

37:39.758 --> 37:42.392
We find a way!

37:42.394 --> 37:43.994
We stick with
the extraction plan.

37:43.996 --> 37:45.595
Are we clear?

37:45.597 --> 37:46.930
Yes, sir.

37:46.932 --> 37:48.331
Mr. President --
director!

37:48.333 --> 37:50.267
This meeting is over.

37:53.472 --> 37:54.871
Anyone could have been bidding
like we were --

37:54.873 --> 37:56.406
Under an alias,
behind a false front.

37:56.408 --> 37:57.974
If you were a major player,
a government,

37:57.976 --> 37:59.242
Why<i> wouldn't</i> you hide it?

37:59.243 --> 38:00.509
Of course no one was
who they said they were.

38:00.512 --> 38:01.711
She could be anywhere,
any country.

38:01.713 --> 38:03.063
North korea -- they'd pay.

38:03.064 --> 38:04.414
Colombians would, too.
Doesn't matter.

38:04.416 --> 38:06.349
We haven't even started talking
about our allies --

38:06.351 --> 38:07.851
England, france, china.

38:07.852 --> 38:09.352
Friendlies or not, it's still
getting the upper hand.

38:09.353 --> 38:10.853
Israel, italy. Even smaller
countries could have her.

38:10.856 --> 38:12.389
Even vatican city
could have her.

38:12.391 --> 38:13.640
Vatican city?

38:13.641 --> 38:14.890
Do you know how much money
vatican city has?

38:14.893 --> 38:16.026
And, yes, immoral or not,
they could be in.

38:16.028 --> 38:17.861
It's leverage.
It's control.

38:17.862 --> 38:19.695
They'd easily pay to get
their hands on her.
Doesn't matter who has her.

38:19.698 --> 38:20.864
I'd prefer it
to the other option.

38:20.866 --> 38:21.931
Drug cartel,
terrorist organization.

38:21.933 --> 38:23.333
Your next
up-and-coming al-qaeda,

38:23.335 --> 38:24.834
Your friendly
neighborhood despot.

38:24.836 --> 38:26.836
It does not matter
who has her!

38:26.838 --> 38:28.405
Huck.

38:28.406 --> 38:29.973
It doesn't matter who has her,
who bought her,

38:29.975 --> 38:33.076
If she went to iran or england
or north korea

38:33.078 --> 38:35.545
Or canada or drug lords.

38:35.547 --> 38:37.747
Whoever they are, whichever
country they represent,

38:37.749 --> 38:40.383
They bought a person
in an auction

38:40.385 --> 38:42.852
To control a president,
to control a nation.

38:42.854 --> 38:45.338
She is not a person
to them.

38:45.339 --> 38:47.823
She is a tool -- a very
expensive, very useful tool.

38:47.826 --> 38:49.759
They want sanctions lifted,

38:49.761 --> 38:51.928
He says no,
they send him olivia's finger.

38:51.930 --> 38:54.864
They want the u.S. To drop
nuclear warheads on iceland,

38:54.866 --> 38:56.449
And he hesitates.

38:56.450 --> 38:58.033
Perhaps they'll send him
a few of her ribs --

38:58.036 --> 38:59.869
Just the bones, just a few.
Huck.

38:59.871 --> 39:01.871
They will take her apart
bit by bit, piece by piece,

39:01.873 --> 39:04.074
Until she is no longer
recognizable as olivia pope,

39:04.076 --> 39:06.643
Until she is no longer
recognizable as a person,

39:06.645 --> 39:09.813
Until she is so far from what
we want to think of as human,

39:09.815 --> 39:13.016
That the president will be able
to let go of her in his mind.

39:13.018 --> 39:15.819
He'll tell himself,
"olivia pope is dead."

39:15.821 --> 39:17.371
Stop it.

39:17.372 --> 39:18.922
So he'll stop caring
when they send him body parts --

39:18.924 --> 39:20.790
An arm or a leg.

39:20.792 --> 39:24.427
And soon, there'll stop being
worthwhile body parts to send.

39:24.429 --> 39:26.930
Shut up. Just stop it.
Just shut up.

39:26.932 --> 39:28.432
Hopefully they'll kill her --

39:28.433 --> 39:29.933
Shoot her in the head,
slit her throat.

39:29.935 --> 39:31.835
Because if they let her
starve to death

39:31.837 --> 39:33.570
Because she's
no longer worth feeding --

39:33.572 --> 39:35.071
Shut up, huck!

39:35.073 --> 39:36.906
Shut up, shut up,
shut up,

39:36.908 --> 39:39.609
Shut up,
you sick bastard!!

39:42.948 --> 39:45.148
Olivia pope is dead.

39:48.854 --> 39:50.854
I have some more
executive orders

39:50.856 --> 39:52.822
To go over with you, sir,
if you have a moment.

39:52.824 --> 39:54.591
I'm sorry i lost it
back there.

39:54.593 --> 39:56.526
Apologize
to director lowry for me.

39:56.528 --> 39:58.661
I refuse
to do that, sir.

39:58.663 --> 39:59.896
You were in the right.

39:59.898 --> 40:02.098
Besides,
if the director of the cia

40:02.100 --> 40:03.800
Can't take
being yelled at,

40:03.802 --> 40:05.101
The future of
our nation's intelligence

40:05.103 --> 40:07.670
Is in severe jeopardy.

40:07.672 --> 40:11.107
43 coffins
are coming off the plane

40:11.109 --> 40:15.645
At dover air base
this afternoon.

40:15.647 --> 40:18.815
Did you know mellie meets
every plane?

40:18.817 --> 40:20.817
I did not, sir, no.

40:20.819 --> 40:25.054
I think she's trying to save
our souls or something.

40:28.927 --> 40:31.027
As if
they could be saved.

40:35.167 --> 40:38.168
We have to
get olivia back --

40:38.170 --> 40:39.669
Not just
because i love her,

40:39.671 --> 40:41.704
Not just because having her
out there

40:41.706 --> 40:42.906
Is a threat
to national security.

40:42.908 --> 40:45.942
There are soldiers
who are never coming home

40:45.944 --> 40:48.611
Because i tried
to get her back --

40:48.613 --> 40:50.980
Someone's father,
someone's husband.

40:50.982 --> 40:54.751
I have killed
so many mothers' sons

40:54.753 --> 40:56.886
Trying to get her back.
Man: Present, hua!

40:56.888 --> 41:00.990
The flags placed on the coffins
where they lay are there...

41:00.992 --> 41:03.193
Because they had the courage
to give their lives,

41:03.195 --> 41:06.596
And i did not have the courage
to give liv's.
Order, hua!

41:07.866 --> 41:12.135
So, she has to come back...

41:12.137 --> 41:15.672
Because their sacrifice
damn well has to mean something.

41:17.609 --> 41:20.143
They cannot have died
for nothing.

41:20.145 --> 41:22.545
They cannot
have gone to their deaths

41:22.547 --> 41:25.014
For no other reason
than i asked them to.

41:47.572 --> 41:49.539
We will get her back.

41:49.541 --> 41:51.841
I promise you, sir --
i will do everything in my power

41:51.843 --> 41:53.042
To make sure
we get her back.
