WEBVTT

00:02.100 --> 00:03.590
(quietly crying)

00:07.370 --> 00:11.033
I paid you to help me
with this adoption.

00:11.070 --> 00:13.277
I, um...

00:13.310 --> 00:15.801
Would you like to take a minute?
No, I'm fine.

00:15.840 --> 00:19.219
I told you that it was
tricky because...

00:19.250 --> 00:22.117
the baby was
half Chippewa Indian

00:22.150 --> 00:24.789
and tribal law might apply,
but you didn't care.

00:24.820 --> 00:27.459
That's why we're
suing you for $6 million.

00:27.490 --> 00:29.048
Any more questions?

00:29.090 --> 00:30.318
Mrs. Gopnik,

00:30.360 --> 00:32.396
who, specifically,
did you hire to help you

00:32.430 --> 00:34.523
with this adoption? Which firm?

00:34.560 --> 00:36.824
Lockhart/Gardner.
And, in fact,
wasn't it Lockhart/Gardner

00:36.870 --> 00:40.169
who failed you? Not...
Objection, it's already
been established

00:40.200 --> 00:41.838
Mrs. Florrick was the lead
attorney on this adoption.
Uh, no,

00:41.870 --> 00:44.634
that has not been established.
David Lee was the lead attorney.
Oh, come on, Alicia,

00:44.670 --> 00:46.831
you know very well...
(everyone clamoring)

00:46.880 --> 00:49.542
It is unconscionable that
you are blaming thIs on me.

00:49.580 --> 00:51.775
SCHMIDT:
One at a time when
speaking. Excuse me,

00:51.810 --> 00:54.142
ladies and gentlemen,
we can't hear everybody.

00:54.180 --> 00:56.148
The teleconferencing
system can't handle

00:56.190 --> 00:57.441
that much crosstalk.

00:57.490 --> 00:58.946
We need to move on. Any
questions from Lockhart/Gardner?
(beep)

00:58.990 --> 01:02.221
They're not after us, they're
after the deeper pockets of
Lockhart/Gardner.

01:02.260 --> 01:04.728
I know, we just need to
get David Lee talking.
DIANE: Mrs. Gopnik,

01:04.760 --> 01:07.092
who at our firm
did you deal with on a

01:07.130 --> 01:09.325
day-to-day basis
with this adoption?

01:09.370 --> 01:10.621
Who? Alicia.

01:10.670 --> 01:13.093
Alicia Florrick?
When she worked at our firm?

01:13.140 --> 01:14.835
Yes.
Was this under
the direction

01:14.870 --> 01:17.236
of David Lee?
Mr. Schmidt, you'll
be allowed follow-up

01:17.270 --> 01:18.464
questions
afterwards.

01:18.510 --> 01:20.137
Thank you, Mr. Lee.
And who

01:20.180 --> 01:21.602
told you
that the adoption

01:21.640 --> 01:23.346
had fallen through?
GOPNIK: Alicia.

01:23.380 --> 01:26.770
So, Alicia was in charge
of the day-to-day,

01:26.820 --> 01:29.687
but for some reason you
are suing both Lockhart/Gardner

01:29.720 --> 01:31.585
and Florrick-Agos
for $6 million?

01:31.620 --> 01:32.848
Is there a question there,

01:32.890 --> 01:34.619
Diane?
Well, I thought
that was a question.

01:34.660 --> 01:36.855
If you're asking whether we're
suing both of your firms,

01:36.890 --> 01:39.222
the answer is yes.

01:39.260 --> 01:41.194
Unfortunately, we
have to leave it there.

01:41.230 --> 01:42.788
I suggest we resume
in three hours

01:42.830 --> 01:46.288
when I land in Chicago.
At which point I'll be
able to question Mrs. Florrick.

01:46.340 --> 01:50.265
Can't wait.
Okay, we'll resume the
teleconference at 1:00p.m.

01:50.310 --> 01:52.130
RECEPTIONIST:
Lockhart/Gardner/Canning.

01:53.640 --> 01:54.834
The vote?

01:54.880 --> 01:57.178
That's my bet.

01:57.210 --> 01:59.872
Are you ready
for questioning?
I'll be fine.

01:59.920 --> 02:01.911
Yeah, we should prep.

02:01.950 --> 02:03.815
Canning seemed a bit
too eager for my taste.

02:03.850 --> 02:05.488
I have to pick up
dinner for tonight,

02:05.520 --> 02:06.782
I'll be back in an hour.

02:06.820 --> 02:08.185
Your son's graduation?

02:08.220 --> 02:09.357
Yup.

02:09.390 --> 02:11.426
We're having a dinner party.

02:11.460 --> 02:12.757
How are you
handling it?

02:12.800 --> 02:14.256
HandHng?

02:14.300 --> 02:15.392
Empty nest.

02:15.430 --> 02:16.795
My mom, she...

02:16.830 --> 02:18.559
she almost broke
down when I left.

02:18.600 --> 02:20.158
Thanks, Cary.
Yeah.
(phone rings)

02:20.200 --> 02:22.464
Oh.

02:22.510 --> 02:23.602
Eli, what's up?

02:23.640 --> 02:25.232
Dis_aster. I'll_ be there
In two minutes.

02:25.270 --> 02:27.306
Wait, uh... you... you'll be
where in two minutes?

02:27.340 --> 02:28.307
Your office.

02:28.340 --> 02:29.341
I'm coming to you.

02:29.380 --> 02:31.200
No, Eli, I'm heading out.

02:31.250 --> 02:32.945
Well, you can't,
Finn's already on his way.

02:32.980 --> 02:34.743
I have an hour.
I have to pick something up.

02:34.780 --> 02:36.589
Finn is pulling out of the race.
What?

02:36.620 --> 02:38.588
Castro dropped a bombshell.
You need to talk to him,

02:38.620 --> 02:40.315
he doesn't like me.
Well,

02:40.360 --> 02:42.225
I can't convince him
if he doesn't want to run.

02:42.260 --> 02:44.285
No, he wants to.
We have to convince him not to.

02:44.330 --> 02:47.754
Eli?
This bombshell will hurt Finn,
it will hurt Peter.

02:47.800 --> 02:49.791
I'm five minutes away,
I'm coming to you.

02:51.570 --> 02:53.197
Oh, come on.

02:53.240 --> 02:54.229
Who did this?

02:55.270 --> 02:57.261
(sighs)

02:59.440 --> 03:01.977
Hi, Mom. Where are you?

03:02.010 --> 03:04.274
Bloomingdale's. What kind of
sunglasses does Zach like?

03:04.310 --> 03:07.211
Uh, Mom, I have to ask
you a favor.

03:07.250 --> 03:10.242
Can you pick up the lasagna
and the cake for tonight?

03:10.290 --> 03:11.712
Why is Zach leaving tomorrow?
Mom,

03:11.750 --> 03:13.251
did you hear my question?

03:13.290 --> 03:15.383
Yes. Why is Zach
leaving tomorrow?

03:15.420 --> 03:17.650
Because he has a summer job
at Georgetown.

03:17.690 --> 03:20.420
It's at Fig Catering
on Blue Island Avenue.
Hey, hey.

03:20.460 --> 03:21.996
Thought you were
heading off.

03:22.030 --> 03:23.725
Why doesn't he just
take the summer off?

03:23.770 --> 03:25.397
Go to India or something.
Mom,

03:25.430 --> 03:27.239
if you don't want to pick up
the food, can you just

03:27.270 --> 03:29.363
tell me that, so I can try
and find someone else?
I can

03:29.410 --> 03:31.366
pick up the food.

03:31.410 --> 03:32.377
Why don't I make it?

03:32.410 --> 03:34.378
What? Oh, no.
Yes.

03:34.410 --> 03:36.446
I can make a lasagna
as good as any caterer.

03:36.480 --> 03:39.005
Uh, I need to keep
things simple tonight,

03:39.050 --> 03:40.540
'cause I'm gonna
be here all day.

03:40.580 --> 03:42.639
Why is it not simple
if I make it? Come on,

03:42.690 --> 03:43.839
let me make the food.

03:43.890 --> 03:45.687
I'm hanging up now.
Mom, please.

03:45.720 --> 03:47.278
What is this, some kind
of empty nest thing?

03:47.320 --> 03:48.287
Is that why you're so tense?

03:48.320 --> 03:49.582
I'm not tense.
Good.

03:49.630 --> 03:51.552
I'll make the food,
I'll see you tonight.

03:51.590 --> 03:53.592
I... Oh.

03:55.830 --> 03:58.264
Howard Lyman.

03:58.300 --> 04:00.962
No.
Yes.

04:01.000 --> 04:04.333
He's undecided?
The only undecided.

04:06.440 --> 04:07.976
(laughing)

04:09.380 --> 04:10.540
That's so my luck this year.

04:10.580 --> 04:11.547
Listen,

04:11.580 --> 04:13.810
just offer him something.

04:13.850 --> 04:15.943
He's easily persuadable.

04:15.980 --> 04:18.380
We're like
a banana republic here.

04:18.420 --> 04:20.980
KALINDA:
And I would hurry.

04:21.020 --> 04:23.625
Diane is not Will,
you know that.

04:23.660 --> 04:25.525
Oh, that's true.

04:25.560 --> 04:28.324
Diane needed Will to
run this firm well.

04:28.360 --> 04:30.590
They were like
yin and yang.
Mm-hmm.

04:30.630 --> 04:32.359
Left brain, right.

04:32.400 --> 04:35.790
We need a strong
managing partner.

04:35.840 --> 04:37.000
What about me?

04:37.040 --> 04:38.007
Oh, Howard,
you don't want

04:38.040 --> 04:41.009
to do that. It's, uh,
too much of a hassle.

04:41.040 --> 04:42.803
Besides, you're too valued
as a senior partner.
Let Canning

04:42.850 --> 04:44.579
be the front man.
You'll be the...

04:44.610 --> 04:46.419
shadow behind the scenes.

04:46.450 --> 04:47.644
Like a puppet master.

04:47.680 --> 04:48.908
(short laugh)
Yes.

04:48.950 --> 04:50.941
We need you to
vote for Canning

04:50.990 --> 04:53.356
at the partnership
meeting tomorrow.

04:53.390 --> 04:55.085
Uh, I'll propose a
change in management,

04:55.120 --> 04:58.351
and you second it.
We have the votes.

04:58.390 --> 04:59.550
HOWARD:
What do I get?

04:59.600 --> 05:01.955
CANNING: You've been wanting
a-an office near the bathrooms,

05:02.000 --> 05:04.059
(chuckling)
we could do that.
And-and, uh

05:04.100 --> 05:05.795
you can have the
biggest one there.

05:05.830 --> 05:06.831
DAVID:
You're currently napping

05:06.870 --> 05:08.394
in your office.
This office...

05:08.440 --> 05:09.407
What are you doing?

05:09.440 --> 05:10.600
What am I doing?

05:10.640 --> 05:12.107
Yes. What is that?

05:12.140 --> 05:13.630
That's Lockhart/Gardner.

05:13.680 --> 05:14.931
They're trying
to bribe Howard Lyman

05:14.980 --> 05:18.438
into voting Diane out
as managing partner.

05:18.480 --> 05:19.777
You can't be watching that.

05:19.820 --> 05:21.515
What? Yes, I can.

05:21.550 --> 05:22.949
No, you can't.
Turn it off.

05:22.990 --> 05:25.345
No, Clarke,
they left their camera on.

05:25.390 --> 05:26.652
They thought they
turned it off

05:26.690 --> 05:28.351
when they turned
the monitor off.

05:28.390 --> 05:29.755
I'm just passively watching.

05:29.790 --> 05:31.348
(sighs)
No.

05:31.390 --> 05:33.927
Funny, you don't
seem passive.

05:33.960 --> 05:35.552
Your camera's on, Mr. Canning.

05:35.600 --> 05:38.319
They can't hear
you, we're muted.

05:40.170 --> 05:41.637
Stop it. This is ridiculous.
Let go of it.

05:41.670 --> 05:42.967
No, you let go!
You're acting childish.

05:43.010 --> 05:44.659
Oh, I acting childish.
Yes, you are,

05:44.710 --> 05:46.132
you're gonna break it...
Hey, guys, guys.

05:46.170 --> 05:47.876
I'm trying to have
a meeting here.

05:47.910 --> 05:50.902
Maybe next time get some doors
on your conference room.

05:50.950 --> 05:52.474
How did you
get this?

05:52.520 --> 05:54.476
I have someone in
Castro's office.

05:54.520 --> 05:55.612
He won't use it now,

05:55.650 --> 05:57.379
he'll wait until
Peter's overcommitted,

05:57.420 --> 05:58.819
or we start spending money
on commercials.

05:58.850 --> 06:00.158
So we put it out first.

06:00.190 --> 06:01.612
No.

06:01.660 --> 06:03.150
Well, then how
do we fight it?

06:03.190 --> 06:05.385
We don't. That's
a crImInal offense.

06:05.430 --> 06:07.455
Well, that's debatable.
Alicia,

06:07.500 --> 06:09.388
it is not debatable.

06:09.430 --> 06:10.624
You bribed a prosecutor
(Clarke and Carey's
voices rising)

06:10.670 --> 06:11.921
to drop drug charges
against your sister.

06:11.970 --> 06:12.994
I didn't bribe
the prose...

06:13.040 --> 06:15.099
Oh, you cut a deal to lessen
charges on another case.

06:15.140 --> 06:16.289
That's a bribe.
CLARKE: You don't know
what you're doing.

06:16.340 --> 06:17.329
CAREY: I do.
CLARKE: You don't realize
the ramifications...

06:17.370 --> 06:19.133
CAREY:
You don't. You're gonna
break this thing.

06:19.170 --> 06:22.105
It's expensive.
Guys, come on. Cary.

06:22.140 --> 06:23.107
CLARKE: Stop! Stop it!
CAREY: Stop it.

06:23.150 --> 06:24.401
What's going on, Eli?

06:24.450 --> 06:25.974
Nothing's going on.

06:26.010 --> 06:28.444
Peter is withdrawing
his support.

06:28.480 --> 06:30.880
Oh, come on. He's endorsed
candidates with worse problems.

06:30.920 --> 06:32.512
At least this is sympathetic.

06:32.560 --> 06:34.118
A bribe is not sympathetic.
She was gonna be

06:34.160 --> 06:35.388
eaten alive
by the system.

06:35.420 --> 06:38.059
She needed time to get back on
her feet, and both my parents

06:38.090 --> 06:40.456
were at the end of their tether.
Peter's movmg on.

06:40.500 --> 06:43.469
We advise you to withdraw
to avoid an embarrassment.

06:43.500 --> 06:45.468
Eli,

06:45.500 --> 06:47.434
is this about the photo?

06:47.470 --> 06:49.062
The photo of Finn
leaving my apartment.

06:49.100 --> 06:51.000
Alicia, you like Finn.
Good for you.

06:51.040 --> 06:54.009
He seems like a
good person, but put
your political hat on.

06:54.040 --> 06:56.702
This is not survivable.

06:56.750 --> 06:59.048
Finn's heroism
will be forgotten
in three months' time

06:59.080 --> 07:00.513
and all we'll
be left with is

07:00.550 --> 07:02.177
(phone rings)
Peter endorsing a briber.

07:02.220 --> 07:04.814
Oh, here he is. Peter.

07:04.850 --> 07:06.954
No, it's Jackie.

07:06.990 --> 07:08.855
Hello, Alicia.

07:08.890 --> 07:10.755
Um, why did you think Peter?

07:10.790 --> 07:13.122
Jackie, can I call you
back in a minute?
Oh, God, what does she want?

07:13.160 --> 07:16.220
Oh, no, it's okay. I just want
to know what cake you want.

07:16.260 --> 07:17.363
Um... Uh, what?

07:17.400 --> 07:21.063
What kind of cake you want
me to make-- uh, meringue,

07:21.100 --> 07:23.660
devil's food...
Jackie, what... I-I don't
need you to make a cake.

07:23.710 --> 07:24.802
Are you sure? Veronica called

07:24.840 --> 07:26.705
and said you wanted me
to bake a cake

07:26.740 --> 07:28.674
for Zach tonight.
No,

07:28.710 --> 07:30.769
I asked her to pick up the cake.

07:30.810 --> 07:32.516
It's too hot.

07:35.120 --> 07:38.749
Wha... Where are
you going? Uh, no,
I'm right here.

07:38.790 --> 07:40.781
Jackie, hold on a sec.
What are you gonna do?
I don't know.

07:40.820 --> 07:41.787
I'm too angry.
Okay, well,

07:41.820 --> 07:43.481
don't withdraw. Let's talk.
Sorry.

07:43.530 --> 07:45.555
Alicia, it's time-sensitive.

07:45.590 --> 07:48.093
Okay. We'll talk later, okay?

07:48.130 --> 07:50.098
Yeah.

07:50.130 --> 07:53.566
Jackie, thanks for the offer,
but I'm gonna...

07:53.600 --> 07:56.137
Jackie?

07:56.170 --> 07:58.138
You can rationalize it
any way you want,

07:58.170 --> 08:00.900
but it would still...
I'm not rationallzmg
anything. Whatever we do,

08:00.940 --> 08:02.976
it's a partner's decision.
You're not a partner.
Hey,

08:03.010 --> 08:05.706
hey, hey, one second.
All right...

08:05.750 --> 08:07.718
CANNING: Diane is great,
but she's still struggling.
DAVID: We don't want her gone,

08:07.750 --> 08:11.538
we just want to...
nudge her aside.
That they left

08:11.590 --> 08:12.659
their camera on?
Yes.

08:12.690 --> 08:13.588
And they can't see us?
No.

08:13.620 --> 08:15.554
And we're trying
to figure out what to do.

08:15.590 --> 08:17.182
We know what to do.
We have to turn it off.

08:17.230 --> 08:18.527
No, it's not
our mistake.

08:18.560 --> 08:22.052
It's their mistake.
We have to zealously
represent our client.

08:22.100 --> 08:23.658
Not by cheating.

08:23.700 --> 08:24.689
It's not cheating.
According to the ABA...

08:24.730 --> 08:26.539
It's an inadvertent
disclosure.

08:26.570 --> 08:28.231
It's like if someone
accrdentally sent you

08:28.270 --> 08:31.000
their-their
courtroom strategy.
Exactly. You have to return it.

08:31.040 --> 08:33.907
No, you don't.
You have to zealously
represent your client

08:33.940 --> 08:36.602
by using it.
People think by adding
"zealously" to everything,

08:36.650 --> 08:37.708
it makes it all right.

08:37.750 --> 08:40.742
"A lavwer who receives
documents not intended for them

08:40.780 --> 08:43.044
"should refrain
from examining the documents

08:43.090 --> 08:44.842
and notify
the sending lawyer."

08:44.890 --> 08:46.551
That is the equivalent
of a document.

08:46.590 --> 08:49.753
Those are the 1992 rules.
The new rules do not say

08:49.790 --> 08:51.849
that the lavwer must refrain
from using the information.

08:51.890 --> 08:53.221
Where are you
reading that?

08:53.260 --> 08:56.252
Follow the link. The new rules
leave It up to the lawyers.
No.

08:56.300 --> 09:00.634
The ABA says the lawyer
must consult with the client.

09:00.670 --> 09:02.934
You're the one being sued
for $6 million, Alicia.

09:02.970 --> 09:05.131
So do we leave it on
or turn It off?

09:05.170 --> 09:06.569
Okay, then.
Mm-hmm.

09:06.610 --> 09:08.669
We're counting on you.
Thank you.

09:08.710 --> 09:10.678
Well, they're not talking
about trial strategy,

09:10.710 --> 09:12.769
they're talking about
moving Diane out.

09:12.820 --> 09:14.276
Has nothing
to do with us.

09:14.320 --> 09:15.639
So we turn it off?
Yes.

09:15.680 --> 09:17.341
Oh... This is
such a mistake.

09:17.390 --> 09:18.982
We can't turn
their side off,

09:19.020 --> 09:20.851
we can only tell them
they left it on.

09:20.890 --> 09:22.721
Wait.

09:22.760 --> 09:24.079
They'll think
we were listening.

09:24.130 --> 09:26.598
We were listening.
Is that a good thing
or a bad thing?

09:29.870 --> 09:31.622
(beep)

09:31.670 --> 09:34.138
Mr. Canning?
David Lee?

09:34.170 --> 09:35.933
You left your
camera on.

09:35.970 --> 09:37.631
Think he'll stick with us?

09:37.670 --> 09:39.672
Who knows? Howard can't remember
what he ate this morning.

09:39.710 --> 09:41.029
Must be muted
on their end.

09:41.080 --> 09:42.229
CANNING:
...Florrick-Agos.

09:42.280 --> 09:43.304
We need
to call them.
Shh.

09:43.350 --> 09:45.204
CANNING:
Then we can handle
Florrick-Agos next.

09:45.250 --> 09:46.308
DAVID:
Did you talk to her?

09:46.350 --> 09:49.342
The wife? Yeah, I spoke
to her after the deposition.

09:49.380 --> 09:50.381
DAVID: She believes you?
CANNING: Yeah.

09:50.420 --> 09:52.650
DA_VID: Mm.
We just agreed
that we can't do this.

09:52.690 --> 09:54.783
Shh! Clarke.
DAVID: And they have no idea?

09:54.820 --> 09:57.380
CANNING: No, Florrick-Agos?
None. Uh, I think she

09:57.430 --> 09:58.886
feels betrayed by them.

09:58.930 --> 10:00.750
You got to make nice
with her, though.

10:00.800 --> 10:02.051
Mrs. Gopnik?
DAVID: I know,

10:02.100 --> 10:04.762
she likes me. And we just
blame it on Alicia.

10:04.800 --> 10:06.062
CANNING:
And Florrick-Agos is done.

10:06.100 --> 10:09.160
DAVID:
Done and gone in 48 hours.

10:09.200 --> 10:12.033
Diane's gonna want
to save Alicia, you know?

10:12.070 --> 10:14.231
Well, we'll get Chumhum,
we'll take Paisley,

10:14.280 --> 10:16.032
and then we'll decide
what to do with her.

10:18.210 --> 10:19.347
That doesn't
change anything.

10:19.380 --> 10:21.018
We have to tell them it's on.

10:21.050 --> 10:24.941
They just said they're
gonna destroy us in 48 hours.

10:24.990 --> 10:26.810
That changes
everything.

10:37.900 --> 10:39.265
(several voices clamoring)

10:39.300 --> 10:40.858
Well, we were listening,
so now we have to...

10:40.900 --> 10:42.800
now we have to decipher
So now we're all overreacting.

10:42.840 --> 10:46.003
what it was that they...
(whistles)

10:46.040 --> 10:47.871
Thank you.

10:47.910 --> 10:49.070
What did they say,
exactly?

10:49.110 --> 10:50.771
They said they
talked to Mrs. Gopnik.

10:50.810 --> 10:52.243
No, they said
they talked to the wife.

10:52.280 --> 10:54.817
I heard "waif."
"Waif"? What does
that even mean?

10:54.850 --> 10:56.715
I don't know.
No. Canning said

10:56.750 --> 10:59.218
he talked to the wife
after the deposition.

10:59.250 --> 11:01.150
And that Florrick-Agos
would collapse in 48 hours.

11:01.190 --> 11:03.351
And that Mrs. Gopnik
feels betrayed by us.

11:03.390 --> 11:04.288
Why?
I don't know.

11:04.330 --> 11:06.321
But it sounds like
they're lying to her.

11:06.360 --> 11:08.157
Remember? David Lee said,
"Did she believe you?"

11:08.200 --> 11:09.724
ROBYN:
It makes no sense.

11:09.770 --> 11:11.897
She's suing both firms
for $6 million.

11:11.930 --> 11:12.931
I mean, even if we settle,

11:12.970 --> 11:14.392
$3 million--
it won't destroy us.

11:14.440 --> 11:16.761
They said they
wanted to blame me.

11:16.810 --> 11:18.061
For what?
We couldn't
hear the rest.

11:18.110 --> 11:19.771
Lockhart/Gardner made a deal
with Mrs. Gopnik,

11:19.810 --> 11:20.936
and she turned on Alicia?

11:20.980 --> 11:22.208
ROBYN:
It still wouldn't destroy us.

11:22.240 --> 11:25.004
It would if Alicia
couldn't practice law.

11:26.150 --> 11:27.378
If we lose Alicia,

11:27.420 --> 11:30.480
we lose Chumhum, Paisley,
a lot of others.

11:30.520 --> 11:32.044
They're trying
to disbar her?

11:32.090 --> 11:33.387
CAREY: Is there
any other mistake

11:33.420 --> 11:34.751
in the adoption work?

11:34.790 --> 11:36.212
Something disbarrable?

11:36.260 --> 11:38.319
I don't think so,
but David Lee was involved,

11:38.360 --> 11:39.827
so anything's possible.

11:39.860 --> 11:41.919
CARY: Okay, so, we go
through the discovery.

11:41.960 --> 11:43.063
We go through
everything.
Wait.

11:43.100 --> 11:44.067
DAVID:
In here.

11:44.100 --> 11:46.125
You know, just get it
ready for 'em to come.

11:46.170 --> 11:47.933
There's five lavwers and
a court reporter, okay?

11:47.970 --> 11:50.006
Just clear everything out.

11:54.980 --> 11:57.073
(items clattering on video)

11:57.110 --> 11:59.169
(phone ringing)

11:59.210 --> 12:01.041
WOMAN:
Yes.

12:01.080 --> 12:03.219
Hello, Grace. What's up?
VERONICA: No, it's Mom.

12:03.250 --> 12:04.808
We're looking for flour.
Where do you keep your flour?

12:04.850 --> 12:07.819
I'm at work, Mom. I'm working!

12:07.860 --> 12:08.952
Foundit

12:08.990 --> 12:10.127
Oh, no problem. We got it.

12:10.160 --> 12:11.354
Who's there with you?

12:11.390 --> 12:13.392
Jackie.

12:13.430 --> 12:15.057
Jackie's there?

12:15.100 --> 12:16.522
Yeah. Why?

12:16.560 --> 12:18.926
Cary, this is exactly
like the NSA.

12:18.970 --> 12:21.063
We were outraged
when they listened to us.

12:21.100 --> 12:23.102
Clarke, I'm responsible
for 60 employees.

12:23.140 --> 12:24.801
This is a decision I made

12:24.840 --> 12:27.832
because I don't want to see
those 60 people out of work.

12:27.880 --> 12:29.871
By that logic,
you can justify any decision.

12:29.910 --> 12:32.003
Yes... but I won't.

12:32.050 --> 12:34.871
Now, help us look through
the adoption discovery.

12:34.920 --> 12:36.888
PETER:
So, how did he take it?

12:36.920 --> 12:40.083
Not great.

12:40.120 --> 12:42.008
But don't worry. He'll back out.
It's his only play.

12:42.060 --> 12:46.258
By the way, have you been, uh,
wearing perfume back here?

12:46.290 --> 12:47.996
Yeah. You don't like it?

12:48.030 --> 12:49.520
Jackie.

12:49.560 --> 12:52.961
She likes to sit at your
desk when you're not here.

12:53.000 --> 12:55.798
You know, it's odd that
he wrote her as "Lady Macbeth."

12:55.840 --> 12:58.001
I think "Mother Macbeth"
would have made more sense.

12:58.040 --> 12:59.268
(laughs)

12:59.310 --> 13:01.335
Well, who's our replacement
going to be?

13:01.380 --> 13:02.574
For Jackie? I don't know.

13:02.610 --> 13:05.078
I could make
up a list.
Very funny.

13:05.110 --> 13:06.941
Someone who's already vetted.

13:06.980 --> 13:08.242
You're getting a reputation.

13:08.280 --> 13:10.111
What about Diane?

13:10.150 --> 13:11.447
Diane Lockhart?

13:11.490 --> 13:13.117
She's already
been vetted.

13:13.160 --> 13:15.048
You don't think she'd make
a good state's attorney?

13:15.090 --> 13:16.819
I think she'd make a
great state's attorney.

13:16.860 --> 13:18.122
I don't know
if she'd do it.

13:18.160 --> 13:20.151
We stood her up at the altar
already, remember?

13:20.200 --> 13:22.156
Let's set up a meeting.

13:22.200 --> 13:23.224
Persuade her.

13:23.270 --> 13:25.124
She'd bring real stature
to the office.

13:25.170 --> 13:27.058
DIANE:
So,

13:27.100 --> 13:29.364
Howard, what do I have to do
to get your vote?

13:29.400 --> 13:32.005
What do you have
to do?
Mm.

13:32.040 --> 13:33.837
I don't know.
What can you do?

13:33.880 --> 13:35.199
Well, you've
been wanting

13:35.240 --> 13:37.071
a different office
for quite a while.
No.

13:37.110 --> 13:38.270
No. I'm good.

13:39.210 --> 13:41.314
Canning offered it to you?

13:41.350 --> 13:43.318
No.

13:43.350 --> 13:45.614
Maybe.

13:45.650 --> 13:47.857
What do you want, Howard?

13:47.890 --> 13:49.983
You know how long
I've been a lawyer?

13:50.030 --> 13:52.089
55 years.
Really?

13:52.130 --> 13:54.894
Yeah. In all of those 55 years,

13:54.930 --> 13:57.398
never once
have I cross-examined anybody.

13:57.430 --> 13:59.466
You want to question a witness?

13:59.500 --> 14:01.934
Well, I was second chair
on the Paisley case,

14:01.970 --> 14:03.130
and I liked it.

14:03.170 --> 14:04.102
Excuse me.
Ms. Lockhart?

14:04.140 --> 14:05.266
Uh, not right now, Bonnie.

14:05.310 --> 14:06.937
The governor is on line two.

14:08.110 --> 14:11.307
Okay, I'll, uh...
I'll get it.

14:11.350 --> 14:13.079
Howard, if you vote my way,

14:13.120 --> 14:15.076
I will let you question
in court.

14:15.120 --> 14:17.338
Mr. Canning and David Lee
will do the same.

14:17.390 --> 14:18.641
No, they won't.

14:18.690 --> 14:20.248
David Lee doesn't_ think
you're up to it.

14:20.290 --> 14:21.484
I do. One second.

14:21.520 --> 14:23.579
Hello, Governor Florrick.

14:23.630 --> 14:25.655
Hi, Diane.
Thanks for taking my call.

14:25.690 --> 14:27.499
Listen, uh,
could we meet with you

14:27.530 --> 14:29.418
sometime today, Eli and myself?

14:29.460 --> 14:31.621
You and...?

14:31.670 --> 14:34.389
Uh, certainly. Regarding?

14:34.440 --> 14:37.238
Well, I think it would be better
if we explained it in person.

14:37.270 --> 14:39.261
So, how about around 5:00?
Is that good for you?

14:39.310 --> 14:40.436
Uh, good.

14:40.480 --> 14:43.176
I-I look forward to it.

14:43.210 --> 14:45.144
See you then.

14:45.180 --> 14:47.319
The Supreme Court?

14:47.350 --> 14:49.215
I don't know. I mean,
that would be odd.

14:49.250 --> 14:51.548
Well, they haven't
filled the seat yet.
It's probably nothing.

14:51.590 --> 14:53.251
A committee or something.

14:53.290 --> 14:54.450
Come with me.

14:54.490 --> 14:56.082
What?

14:56.120 --> 14:58.179
No. I want a...
I want a posse there.

14:58.230 --> 15:00.027
Uh, Diane, I-I really
don't think I'm right.

15:00.060 --> 15:01.197
Yes, you are right.

15:01.230 --> 15:03.164
Howard, how would you like
to question a witness today?

15:03.200 --> 15:05.259
Uh, I think we should...

15:05.300 --> 15:06.460
It's a deposition.

15:06.500 --> 15:08.434
Whatever he doesn't cover,
we'll follow up.

15:08.470 --> 15:10.267
What do you say, Howard?

15:10.310 --> 15:12.699
Anything yet? I'm being deposed
in about 30 minutes.

15:12.740 --> 15:14.230
Nothing yet.

15:14.280 --> 15:15.679
They could have kept it
out of discovery.

15:15.710 --> 15:18.201
If David Lee had anything
to do with it, that's my bet.

15:18.250 --> 15:20.172
You think they're gonna
sandbag me at the deposition?

15:20.220 --> 15:21.209
Possibly.

15:21.250 --> 15:23.241
Here's the other thing.

15:28.490 --> 15:30.458
Robyn and I
were talking.

15:30.490 --> 15:32.378
We think you should go
over there to be deposed.

15:32.430 --> 15:34.398
Lockhart/Gardner? Why?

15:34.430 --> 15:37.160
So they don't turn off the
teleconferencing camera, or...?

15:37.200 --> 15:38.565
Not just that.

15:38.600 --> 15:40.534
Tell them you want
to discuss the discovery,

15:40.570 --> 15:41.730
what documents are missing.

15:41.770 --> 15:43.237
They're not gonna
say anything.

15:43.270 --> 15:45.602
Not in your
presence.

15:45.640 --> 15:47.278
You're kidding.

15:47.310 --> 15:48.277
No. After you leave,
we'll see what they say

15:48.310 --> 15:49.402
about missing
documents.

15:49.440 --> 15:51.078
It's smart.

15:51.110 --> 15:53.214
It's slimy.
They're trying
to set us up.

15:53.250 --> 15:55.218
Trying to set you up.

15:55.250 --> 15:57.241
It's not slimy.
It's self-defense.

15:59.690 --> 16:01.715
CANNING:
Mrs. Florrick, thanks
for coming to our place.

16:01.760 --> 16:03.079
It wasn't
necessary.

16:03.130 --> 16:04.256
I didn't want any
misunderstanding

16:04.290 --> 16:05.029
in the_
transmi55ion.

16:05.060 --> 16:07.699
Mr. Schmidt, Mr.
Canning, Diane.

16:09.500 --> 16:11.024
I never rate, do I?

16:11.070 --> 16:12.196
ALICIA:
David.

16:12.230 --> 16:13.265
How are you?

16:13.300 --> 16:14.232
Peachy keen.

16:14.270 --> 16:15.339
Shall we start?

16:15.370 --> 16:17.201
I have no questions for Alicia.

16:17.240 --> 16:18.537
Diane?

16:18.570 --> 16:19.537
Yes, Howard actually

16:19.570 --> 16:21.071
has some questions.

16:21.110 --> 16:22.475
Wait. What?

16:22.510 --> 16:24.239
Howard is going
to examine Alicia.

16:24.280 --> 16:27.010
He... No, he isn't.
Yes, he is.

16:27.050 --> 16:29.541
I have the utmost
confidence in Howard.

16:29.580 --> 16:32.185
You don't, David?

16:32.220 --> 16:34.313
SCHMIDT:
Do you, uh,

16:34.360 --> 16:36.214
want us to step out
for a second?
DIANE: No, no.

16:36.260 --> 16:38.023
We're good. Howard?

16:38.060 --> 16:40.255
I...
Shut up. Shut up.

16:40.300 --> 16:42.256
Lyman? Why Howard Lyman?

16:42.300 --> 16:44.268
He's an idiot.

16:44.300 --> 16:46.097
Is your name Alicia Florrick?

16:46.130 --> 16:47.233
It is.

16:47.270 --> 16:49.738
And did you bribe
the Indian council?

16:49.770 --> 16:51.465
You mean, the Tribal council?

16:51.510 --> 16:53.273
Well, the Tribal council

16:53.310 --> 16:55.608
and the Indian council
is the same thing.

16:55.640 --> 16:57.278
I don't believe
they refer to themselves

16:57.310 --> 16:58.402
with that colloquialism.

16:58.450 --> 16:59.803
Would you just answer
the question?

16:59.850 --> 17:02.819
I did not bribe
the Tribal council.

17:02.850 --> 17:04.317
And you expect us
to believe that?

17:04.350 --> 17:06.318
ALICIA:
I do.

17:06.350 --> 17:08.056
You did everything else
on the case.

17:08.090 --> 17:10.752
Yes, but David Lee--
behind my back--

17:10.790 --> 17:13.293
attempted to bribe
the Tribal council, and

17:13.330 --> 17:15.753
that's why
this adoption fell through.

17:15.800 --> 17:18.496
But, uh, what is this?

17:18.530 --> 17:20.395
A Xerox of a take-out menu.

17:22.400 --> 17:24.368
What is this?

17:24.410 --> 17:25.809
Um...

17:25.840 --> 17:27.398
it's a transcript.

17:27.440 --> 17:28.372
A transcript

17:28.410 --> 17:30.605
of a deposition, to be exact.

17:30.650 --> 17:33.175
It's not offensive _
to say "Indian counCIl."

17:33.220 --> 17:34.619
They don't
mind "Indian."

17:34.650 --> 17:36.277
What the hell?

17:36.320 --> 17:38.686
Would you read from here,
Mrs. Flo_rrick?
Question:

17:38.720 --> 17:40.358
"How do you turn this thing on?
Is this

17:40.390 --> 17:41.459
the new kind of smart phone?"
Answer: "Yes."

17:41.490 --> 17:43.424
HOWARD:
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

17:43.460 --> 17:46.258
You mean, here.

17:46.290 --> 17:49.851
ALICIA:
Question: "On March 6, 2013,
did you send

17:49.900 --> 17:51.527
"Chief Joshua
Proudfoot of

17:51.570 --> 17:53.561
"the Chippewa Nation
$10,000 in cash

17:53.600 --> 17:56.296
to induce the tribe not
to object to this adoption?"

17:56.340 --> 17:58.228
Answer: "I did."

17:58.270 --> 17:59.737
So you did?
No. I just read that.

17:59.770 --> 18:02.307
This was one of your associates
being deposed.

18:02.340 --> 18:04.547
But what does it say next?

18:04.580 --> 18:05.877
You want me to keep reading?

18:05.910 --> 18:07.810
I demand that you keep reading.

18:07.850 --> 18:10.318
(Alicia clears her throat)
Question:

18:10.350 --> 18:12.511
"And at whose direction did you
deliver this inducement?"

18:12.550 --> 18:14.256
Answer: "Alicia Florrick."

18:14.290 --> 18:17.123
Aha. There it is
in black and white.

18:17.160 --> 18:18.320
He's lying.
Is he?

18:18.360 --> 18:20.328
Or are you lying?
He's lying.

18:20.360 --> 18:22.123
Why would the associate lie?

18:22.160 --> 18:23.627
There's no reason.

18:23.670 --> 18:25.820
Because he wanted
to be made a partner here,

18:25.870 --> 18:28.634
and you made him a partner here.

18:28.670 --> 18:30.137
It's not a reason.

18:30.170 --> 18:31.432
Actually, it is.

18:31.470 --> 18:32.664
Maybe it's a
smokescreen?

18:32.710 --> 18:36.339
They're trying to |u|| us
into a false sense of security?

18:36.380 --> 18:38.371
Okay, so I'm lulled.

18:38.410 --> 18:40.412
Good job, Howard.
Fun.

18:41.520 --> 18:43.385
Um, do you have a minute?

18:43.420 --> 18:45.843
I have a question I'd
like to ask you two.
What?

18:45.890 --> 18:47.312
Okay, here we go.

18:47.360 --> 18:49.385
ALICIA:
I would like
to do it in private?

18:49.420 --> 18:52.480
Fine. We can go in my office.

18:52.530 --> 18:53.656
Damn it.
Keep them there.

18:55.700 --> 18:59.466
Actually, um,
can we do it, uh, here?

18:59.500 --> 19:01.934
Why?

19:01.970 --> 19:03.562
CANNING:
Oh.

19:03.610 --> 19:08.309
Yeah, uh, I... I didn't want
to take Will's office.

19:08.340 --> 19:11.468
I just thought it would be best
if clients didn't see it empty.

19:11.510 --> 19:13.512
We can do it here.

19:18.420 --> 19:20.411
DIANE:
Uh, well, what is it?

19:20.460 --> 19:22.781
What documents did you leave out
of the discovery?

19:22.820 --> 19:25.323
What documents? No documents.
What are you talking about?

19:25.360 --> 19:27.419
We made copies of everything
when we left Lockhart/Gardner,

19:27.460 --> 19:29.223
so if there are any
additional documents,

19:29.260 --> 19:30.420
we'll be able to check.

19:30.470 --> 19:31.459
Are you accusing us of...?

19:31.500 --> 19:33.388
Alicia, I-I don't understand.
What are you saying?

19:33.440 --> 19:35.260
I don't want this
to get confrontational.

19:35.300 --> 19:36.289
I just want
to warn you:

19:36.340 --> 19:38.729
we'll look askance at any
late-arriving evidence.

19:43.610 --> 19:44.577
Okay, here we go.

19:44.610 --> 19:45.747
DIANE:
What was that about?

19:45.780 --> 19:47.213
I have no idea.

19:47.250 --> 19:49.309
CANNING:
She's warning us. Why?

19:49.350 --> 19:50.817
Not gonna say anything
with Diane there.

19:50.850 --> 19:53.819
Not unless...

19:53.860 --> 19:55.612
ROBYN:
What?

19:57.830 --> 19:59.582
What is it?
CARY: _
Can you zoom in?

19:59.630 --> 20:01.222
Not without them knowing.

20:01.260 --> 20:02.625
Can you record it?
No.

20:02.660 --> 20:04.662
It's a live stream. Why?

20:09.540 --> 20:10.359
Oh, it's not
what we thought.

20:10.410 --> 20:11.661
They don't have the wife
that we thought.

20:11.710 --> 20:13.701
It's not Mrs. Gopnik?

20:14.710 --> 20:16.473
No.

20:16.510 --> 20:17.602
Your 3:00 is here.

20:17.650 --> 20:20.539
CANNING:
Oh, great. In my office.

20:20.580 --> 20:21.945
Who is it?
Deena Lampard.

20:21.980 --> 20:23.516
Who's that?

20:23.550 --> 20:24.915
Neil Gross's wife.

20:24.950 --> 20:27.453
Oh, crap.

20:27.490 --> 20:31.381
Yeah. They have Mrs. Chumhum,
and we're screwed.

20:37.060 --> 20:38.527
That smells good.

20:38.570 --> 20:40.561
Well, had to make due
with what's here.

20:40.600 --> 20:42.966
It's not my best.
Why do you always do that?

20:43.000 --> 20:43.932
I just gave you a compliment,

20:43.970 --> 20:45.631
and you made it sound
like an accusation.

20:45.670 --> 20:48.036
I'm just trying
to explain why...

20:48.080 --> 20:49.104
Ugh. You're right.

20:49.140 --> 20:52.348
Your daughter always accused me
of the same thing.

20:52.380 --> 20:54.041
I guess she's a lot like me,

20:54.080 --> 20:56.275
and Peter's a lot like you.

20:56.320 --> 20:58.345
Now, that sounded
like an accusation.

20:58.390 --> 21:01.416
It did, didn't it?

21:01.460 --> 21:03.951
I see where Alicia's drinking
comes from.

21:03.990 --> 21:05.958
And Peter's rudeness.

21:05.990 --> 21:08.424
No wonder they're splitting up.

21:08.460 --> 21:10.894
What?
No wonder
they're splitting up,

21:10.930 --> 21:13.637
or not splitting up, or just
doing the power couple thing.

21:13.670 --> 21:14.534
What does that mean?

21:14.570 --> 21:15.889
Forwarding their own careers

21:15.940 --> 21:17.737
while sleeping
with anyone they want.

21:19.770 --> 21:21.909
They're not doing that.

21:21.940 --> 21:23.032
Oh, yes, they are.

21:23.080 --> 21:24.809
Where did you hear that?
From my son.

21:24.850 --> 21:26.340
Alicia talks to him.

21:26.380 --> 21:28.348
Well, that's awful.

21:28.380 --> 21:30.018
Oh, it's fine.

21:30.050 --> 21:31.642
They're getting along better
than they did

21:31.690 --> 21:32.839
when they were sleeping
together.

21:32.890 --> 21:34.881
Are you all right?

21:36.120 --> 21:39.351
I don't like the way
you're waving this in my face.

21:39.390 --> 21:41.358
I am hardly waving this
in your face.

21:41.400 --> 21:42.594
(door opens)
GRACE:
Hi, Mom.

21:42.630 --> 21:43.767
Oh, hi, honey.

21:43.800 --> 21:45.427
It's not Mom.
How are you, Grace?

21:45.470 --> 21:46.425
We're making dinner.

21:46.470 --> 21:47.892
GRACE:
Oh.

21:47.940 --> 21:50.568
ALICIA:
So,

21:50.610 --> 21:52.828
this isn't about Mrs. Gopnik
at all?

21:52.870 --> 21:56.670
This is about Mrs. Gross?

21:56.710 --> 21:58.746
It looked like her.

21:58.780 --> 22:01.715
Last time I saw her was during
their fight over their prenup.

22:01.750 --> 22:04.116
We lose Chumhum, that would
close our doors, right?

22:04.150 --> 22:06.914
It's still_75°_/o of
our operating income.

22:06.950 --> 22:08.417
ROBYN:
Does she have that much sway

22:08.460 --> 22:10.428
over her husband?

22:10.460 --> 22:12.087
Did you try Neil Gross?

22:12.130 --> 22:13.757
He's traveling in China.

22:13.800 --> 22:15.449
They said,
"Does she believe you?"

22:15.500 --> 22:17.559
That's what they said
in the teleconference?
Yes.

22:17.600 --> 22:19.761
So they're lying
to her.

22:19.800 --> 22:21.768
About us.
So we meet with her.

22:21.800 --> 22:23.438
Ask her if she's happy.
No.

22:23.470 --> 22:25.438
Cary, you do it.
She liked you.

22:25.470 --> 22:27.108
(phone rings)
Work your magic.

22:27.140 --> 22:29.802
God, I am the new Will.

22:29.840 --> 22:30.943
Sorry.

22:30.980 --> 22:32.800
Hello.
PETER:
Hey, it's me.

22:32.850 --> 22:35.819
Sorry to bother you at work.
Oh, no, that's okay, Peter.

22:35.850 --> 22:36.748
What do you need?

22:36.780 --> 22:38.839
This is gonna seem
like an odd question.

22:38.890 --> 22:41.711
Do you know
where your casserole dish is?

22:42.760 --> 22:44.455
What?

22:44.490 --> 22:46.856
Mother called.
She said she couldn't call you.

22:46.890 --> 22:48.858
They're making lasagna
at your apartment.

22:48.900 --> 22:51.926
Oh, dear mother of God.
She called you?

22:51.970 --> 22:53.835
They sound
like they've been drinking.

22:53.870 --> 22:55.565
I'm gonna kill them.

22:55.600 --> 22:57.568
I'm in a meeting,
so I really don't know...

22:57.610 --> 23:00.408
Peter, just tell them to stop.

23:00.440 --> 23:01.930
This needs to stop. Seriously.

23:01.980 --> 23:03.538
I would go there myself
with a hatchet,

23:03.580 --> 23:05.138
but I'm in the middle
of something here.

23:05.180 --> 23:07.148
Okay.

23:07.180 --> 23:09.148
You didn't, uh...

23:09.180 --> 23:11.978
you didn't say anything
to Mother about us,

23:12.020 --> 23:14.056
about our situation, did you?

23:14.090 --> 23:16.581
To Jackie? No. Why?

23:16.620 --> 23:20.522
She mentioned something about
wanting to talk to both of us.

23:20.560 --> 23:22.494
Alicia, we need you
over here.

23:22.530 --> 23:25.624
Uh, we're not talking to Jackie.

23:25.670 --> 23:26.489
I know.

23:26.530 --> 23:30.068
Aanay, how do you feel
about tomorrow?

23:30.100 --> 23:32.534
Tomorrow?
Empty nest?

23:32.570 --> 23:35.437
I'll be fine.
I'll see you tonight at 8:00.

23:36.910 --> 23:39.549
Oh, Eli.

23:39.580 --> 23:42.219
You busy?

23:42.250 --> 23:44.718
ALICIA:
I thought we were only watching
things that had to do with us.

23:44.750 --> 23:47.583
This does.
DIANE: Alicia was open
to the idea at one point,

23:47.620 --> 23:49.178
but others were reluctant.

23:49.220 --> 23:50.756
What can we offer them?
Guaranteed partnerships?

23:50.790 --> 23:52.655
They want to merge?
Diane does.

23:52.690 --> 23:53.793
I don't think
Canning's scheme

23:53.830 --> 23:55.525
has anything to do with this.

23:55.560 --> 23:58.666
Cary wants three years of
segregated Chumhum money.

23:58.700 --> 24:00.531
We can't do that.
I know.

24:00.570 --> 24:03.835
Can you talk to him,
Kalinda, see what you can do?

24:03.870 --> 24:06.009
I know we keep asking this
of you,

24:06.040 --> 24:08.873
but it's important.

24:08.910 --> 24:12.038
Sure.

24:12.080 --> 24:13.718
JULIUS:
What can she do?

24:13.750 --> 24:15.012
I guess I don't understand.

24:15.050 --> 24:16.608
DIANE:
Kalinda has a way with Cary.

24:16.650 --> 24:20.017
We've exploited this before.

24:20.050 --> 24:23.554
So, Canning will vote
against the merger,

24:23.590 --> 24:26.684
so we_ wait until after
the managing partnership vote.

24:26.730 --> 24:29.551
I go to Florrick-Agos.
We guarantee them

24:29.600 --> 24:32.694
an equal number of seats
on the managing committees
(phone buzzing)

24:32.730 --> 24:36.564
and 18 months
of segregated Chumhum profit.

24:36.600 --> 24:38.158
Hello.

24:38.210 --> 24:41.008
Cary, uh, what are you doing?

24:41.040 --> 24:42.268
Working.

24:42.310 --> 24:44.608
Are we still on for 6:00
this evening?

24:44.650 --> 24:46.743
Um...

24:46.780 --> 24:48.771
6:00.

24:50.750 --> 24:52.513
Do you still want to be?

24:52.550 --> 24:55.610
Yeah. Um, don't you?

24:55.660 --> 24:57.150
Sure.

24:57.190 --> 24:58.657
You're being weird.

24:58.690 --> 25:01.124
Look, I'll see you tonight
at 6:00, okay?

25:01.160 --> 25:03.799
Yep.

25:07.840 --> 25:09.193
We need to
discuss this.

25:09.240 --> 25:10.935
Where?

25:10.970 --> 25:12.608
Can I just say

25:12.640 --> 25:14.278
this was
a stupid design choice?

25:14.310 --> 25:17.279
We need someplace
with walls and doors.

25:17.310 --> 25:19.505
Like Lockhart/Gardner?

25:21.650 --> 25:24.141
(truck beeping)

25:24.190 --> 25:26.681
I think we should merge.

25:26.720 --> 25:28.688
I disagree.

25:28.720 --> 25:29.948
They're offering us

25:29.990 --> 25:31.958
equal spots
on management committees.

25:31.990 --> 25:33.958
That's where all the decisions
are made.

25:34.000 --> 25:36.696
We could be the top firm
in Chicago.
Yes.

25:36.730 --> 25:38.789
And your name will be on
the letterhead and mine won't.
You don't

25:38.830 --> 25:39.660
know that.

25:39.700 --> 25:40.667
Alicia,

25:40.700 --> 25:42.861
don't try to sell me.

25:42.900 --> 25:45.733
You are the governor's wife.
Your name means something.

25:45.770 --> 25:48.330
So we'll insist that
yours is on it, too.

25:48.380 --> 25:50.200
Well, why would
we do this?

25:50.240 --> 25:52.572
We said we wanted to build
something from the ground up,

25:52.610 --> 25:53.304
something
that we could be proud of.

25:53.350 --> 25:55.011
Why would we go back?

25:55.050 --> 25:56.813
Because we're struggling.

25:56.850 --> 25:58.681
Because...

25:58.720 --> 26:00.984
(truck whirring)
I'm tired.

26:01.020 --> 26:01.759
What?

26:01.790 --> 26:03.587
I'm tired!

26:03.630 --> 26:06.986
I don't want to just keep
struggling to stay alive.

26:07.030 --> 26:08.224
That's not why you're tired.

26:08.260 --> 26:11.093
Excuse me?
You are not

26:11.130 --> 26:13.269
tired because of work.

26:14.300 --> 26:17.133
Are we talking about Will?

26:17.170 --> 26:19.035
Is it about Will?

26:19.070 --> 26:21.834
If you're angry
at what Kalinda said,

26:21.880 --> 26:23.677
you take it out on her.

26:24.710 --> 26:26.678
I've got the
votes, Cary.

26:26.710 --> 26:29.213
I've got the votes
to get us to merge.

26:30.050 --> 26:32.746
So that's how it'll be?

26:32.790 --> 26:34.155
Fight to the death?

26:34.190 --> 26:36.579
No. We vote.

26:44.230 --> 26:46.221
(indistinct chatter)

26:56.680 --> 26:58.705
Can you do
something for me?

26:58.750 --> 27:00.718
Just me.

27:00.750 --> 27:02.843
You can't tell Alicia.
What?

27:02.880 --> 27:05.940
Sound out the partners.
Get a head count

27:05.990 --> 27:07.082
on merging
with Lockhart/Gardner.

27:07.120 --> 27:08.212
CAREY:
No, we can't merge with them.

27:08.260 --> 27:09.386
They'll lay off half our staff.

27:09.420 --> 27:11.923
I know.

27:11.960 --> 27:14.053
I need a vote
count in an hour.
You got it.

27:14.100 --> 27:16.193
Bob, hey.

27:16.230 --> 27:19.165
You got a minute to talk
about this merger stuff?

27:19.200 --> 27:22.237
Diane, thank you for coming in
on such short notice.

27:22.270 --> 27:23.737
Of course.
It's an honor.

27:23.770 --> 27:25.863
I hope you don't mind
if Kalinda sits in.

27:25.910 --> 27:28.071
She's become
an invaluable girl Friday.

27:28.110 --> 27:29.202
Kalinda, hi.

27:29.240 --> 27:31.071
Peter.

27:31.110 --> 27:33.749
So, Mr. Governor,

27:33.780 --> 27:36.214
what is this
pressmg matter?

27:36.250 --> 27:38.047
Well, we hated

27:38.090 --> 27:40.183
how it ended up last year
with the Supreme Court spot,

27:40.220 --> 27:42.381
and we wanted to bring
this offer to you personally.

27:42.420 --> 27:43.409
I'm glad you did.
Diane,

27:43.460 --> 27:45.428
how would you feel

27:45.460 --> 27:48.054
about running
for state's attorney?

27:50.930 --> 27:52.227
Oh.

27:52.270 --> 27:53.362
ELI: _
Yes, we were endor5ing

27:53.400 --> 27:56.289
Finn Polmar, but he's
in the process of dropping out.

27:56.340 --> 27:58.831
And, uh, you're pre-vetted.
Actually,

27:58.870 --> 28:02.431
we think you would also make
a terrific state's attorney.

28:02.480 --> 28:03.742
Yes.

28:03.780 --> 28:06.169
But not Supreme Court justice?

28:07.950 --> 28:10.248
Well, unfortunately,
that position

28:10.280 --> 28:13.078
has been offered
to Harley Joseph.

28:13.120 --> 28:15.111
Yes, I know.

28:15.160 --> 28:17.822
This is an honor, Diane.

28:17.860 --> 28:19.987
We're offering to put
all the power and prestige

28:20.030 --> 28:21.452
of the governor's office
behind you.

28:21.500 --> 28:23.127
I really do hope you will...

28:23.160 --> 28:24.764
consider it.

28:27.530 --> 28:29.862
Uh, when do you need an answer?

28:29.900 --> 28:32.903
Tomorrow. We need to play
a little bit of catch-up.

28:35.910 --> 28:37.878
Good. Thank you.

28:37.910 --> 28:40.947
I shall consider it.

28:40.980 --> 28:43.210
You all right?

28:43.250 --> 28:46.139
You mean because they offered me
the state's attorney's office

28:46.190 --> 28:48.010
and not Supreme Court justice?

28:48.060 --> 28:49.413
And they didn't
come to me first?

28:49.460 --> 28:51.883
And they only came to me
because I was pre-vetted?

28:51.930 --> 28:53.158
Am I all right with that?

28:53.190 --> 28:55.158
Yeah.
Peachy.

28:55.200 --> 28:57.498
Kalinda, could you
find out, ifI did run,

28:57.530 --> 28:59.760
what I would
be up against?

28:59.800 --> 29:02.769
Would I be conflicted
out of my partnership?

29:02.800 --> 29:04.836
I'm on it.

29:04.870 --> 29:06.508
So you're considering it?

29:06.540 --> 29:09.509
I don't know. The world
is so confusing right now.

29:09.540 --> 29:13.306
I just might quit and
go live in New Zealand.

29:17.350 --> 29:19.318
Hey, Cary,

29:19.350 --> 29:21.352
I'm up here.

29:26.230 --> 29:28.221
What?

29:32.500 --> 29:34.195
(moaning)

29:34.240 --> 29:36.231
Hey, slow down.

29:39.570 --> 29:42.334
Kalinda, just
shut up.

29:42.380 --> 29:44.871
Excuse me?

29:44.910 --> 29:47.276
I am not one
of your women.

29:47.310 --> 29:50.211
I'm not gonna go slow
when you want me to go slow.

29:50.250 --> 29:51.945
Get off of me, Cary.

29:51.990 --> 29:53.958
Why? You don't
like it like this?

29:53.990 --> 29:56.982
Cary, get off of me.
I swear I'll hurt you.

30:05.270 --> 30:07.261
(sighs)

30:08.270 --> 30:09.862
Hey.

30:09.900 --> 30:11.902
What's going on?

30:17.280 --> 30:19.271
(phone buzzing)

30:20.950 --> 30:23.248
Hello?

30:23.280 --> 30:25.942
Hey, it's Carey.
The count is close.

30:25.990 --> 30:29.289
I can't believe it, but Alicia
is up by two partners.

30:29.320 --> 30:31.550
If the merger were voted on
today, we would lose.

30:31.590 --> 30:32.921
Okay.

30:32.960 --> 30:34.325
What are you gonna do?

30:34.360 --> 30:36.123
We can't merge
with Lockhart/Gardner.

30:36.160 --> 30:38.162
I'll talk with you.

30:42.300 --> 30:44.302
What was that?

30:45.340 --> 30:47.331
(exhales)

30:57.680 --> 30:59.910
Is this private
enough for you?

30:59.950 --> 31:01.451
Mr. Canning.

31:01.490 --> 31:03.287
Mr. Agos.

31:03.320 --> 31:05.880
We haven't had many
dealings, have we?
No.

31:05.930 --> 31:08.398
You don't like
me, do you?

31:08.430 --> 31:09.897
No.

31:10.930 --> 31:13.933
What did you want to tell me?

31:16.670 --> 31:20.333
Diane wants to merge with us.

31:20.370 --> 31:23.009
She'll wait until she's voted in
as managing partner

31:23.040 --> 31:25.304
and then approach us
about a merger.

31:25.350 --> 31:28.148
How do you know this?

31:29.450 --> 31:32.010
You don't want a merger,
and I don't want a merger.

31:32.050 --> 31:34.518
So whatever moves you want
to make, I'd make 'em now.

31:36.690 --> 31:38.885
Nice talking to you.

31:47.100 --> 31:50.263
God, look at you.
You look so adult.

31:50.300 --> 31:53.064
Can I take it off now?
No, you have to keep
it on for the next

31:53.110 --> 31:55.203
24 hours. It's a law.
(chuckles)

31:55.240 --> 31:58.107
Whew. You're all packed.
What a good boy.

31:58.150 --> 31:59.970
Yeah, I'm leaving tomorrow.
Yeah,

32:00.010 --> 32:00.669
so Alicia said.

32:00.710 --> 32:02.211
I think she's sad.
No.

32:02.250 --> 32:03.547
She did the same
thing to me.

32:03.580 --> 32:04.683
Left right after
graduation.

32:04.720 --> 32:05.687
Didn't want
the tears,

32:05.720 --> 32:07.085
didn't want the hugs.

32:07.120 --> 32:08.678
She left that same night.

32:08.720 --> 32:10.654
Really?
We didn't have
time for a cake.

32:10.690 --> 32:12.624
She was so anxious
to get away from me.

32:12.660 --> 32:13.820
Did she have _
a summer internship?
No,

32:13.860 --> 32:16.590
she just wanted to get started
looking for an apartment.

32:16.630 --> 32:18.393
I cried like a baby.

32:18.430 --> 32:19.522
Kids are tougher.

32:19.570 --> 32:21.037
They know better.

32:22.070 --> 32:24.038
I think I smell
the cake burning.

32:24.070 --> 32:27.062
Does that smell
like the cake's burning?

32:28.310 --> 32:30.301
(knocking)

32:32.310 --> 32:34.744
Hello?

32:34.780 --> 32:36.748
Front door's open.

32:36.780 --> 32:38.589
Hello?

32:38.620 --> 32:41.453
Jackie, how are we?

32:41.490 --> 32:43.185
Oh, Mr. Gold.

32:43.220 --> 32:45.381
What a surprise.

32:45.430 --> 32:46.658
CAREY:
Canning and David Lee

32:46.690 --> 32:48.499
are scheming again.

32:50.460 --> 32:52.724
DAVID:
They've got Howard. He won't
switch back to us. Idiot.

32:52.770 --> 32:54.567
CANNING:
We got another problem.

32:54.600 --> 32:56.488
I just heard
that Diane is offering

32:56.540 --> 32:57.393
a merger with Florrick-Agos

32:57.440 --> 32:59.499
if she gets
the managing partnership.

32:59.540 --> 33:01.508
She'll give Florrick-Agos
all the top positions

33:01.540 --> 33:03.508
on the management committees.

33:03.540 --> 33:06.008
DAVID:
Oh, what the hell?

33:06.050 --> 33:07.449
How did you find out?

33:07.480 --> 33:09.016
Oh, uh...

33:10.050 --> 33:12.189
That kid on the other side.

33:12.220 --> 33:13.744
What is his name? Uh...

33:13.790 --> 33:16.008
The name partner.

33:16.060 --> 33:17.186
Cary... He told me.

33:17.220 --> 33:18.426
What?

33:18.460 --> 33:20.052
Is this true?

33:20.090 --> 33:21.421
ALICIA:
Did you really go

33:21.460 --> 33:23.519
to Canning, Cary? Did you?

33:23.560 --> 33:25.596
Yes.

33:25.630 --> 33:27.621
Why the hell...?!

33:27.670 --> 33:30.491
Because a merger
is a mistake.

33:30.540 --> 33:32.462
Do you know
what a betrayal this is?!

33:32.510 --> 33:33.761
I know if we join
Lockhart/Gardner,

33:33.810 --> 33:35.175
it will be over.

33:35.210 --> 33:36.609
Well, then argue that,
discuss that,

33:36.640 --> 33:38.540
but you don't go
to the other side.

33:38.580 --> 33:40.275
I will argue that.

33:40.310 --> 33:42.414
But they should know
what Diane is doing.

33:42.450 --> 33:44.748
Diane is operating
in secret.
No, no, no.

33:44.790 --> 33:46.815
Don't turn this
into some selfless act.

33:46.850 --> 33:48.317
I'm not turning
it into anything.

33:48.360 --> 33:50.157
You wanted to sabotage
Diane's efforts.

33:50.190 --> 33:52.488
It will only sabotage it if
she doesn't have the support.

33:52.530 --> 33:54.350
Oh, that is such
a load of crap, Cary.

33:54.400 --> 33:56.152
Well, I'm sorry I don't
hold up to your standards!

33:56.200 --> 33:58.566
You _wanted to take this offer
right out of our hands!

33:58.600 --> 33:59.794
Let's take this outside.
No!

33:59.830 --> 34:01.297
I can't believe you.

34:01.340 --> 34:02.637
It's so wrong.

34:02.670 --> 34:04.433
What was wrong was
listening to them at all.

34:04.470 --> 34:05.732
IfI did this,
you would be appalled,

34:05.770 --> 34:07.101
and you would have
every right to be.

34:07.140 --> 34:08.471
What I hate is_that
you are argumg

34:08.510 --> 34:09.670
for a merger that
will benefit you!

34:09.710 --> 34:11.507
Well, if that's what mattered
to you, Cary, argue for that.

34:11.550 --> 34:13.541
What about the 30 paralegals?
What about the other people?

34:13.580 --> 34:14.547
Oh, you know what?
Go to hell, Cary.

34:14.580 --> 34:16.138
If you think so little...

34:16.180 --> 34:17.374
That is your answer to
anything you can't deal with!

34:17.420 --> 34:18.739
If you think so little
of our partnership,

34:18.790 --> 34:20.417
we should quit this now!

34:20.450 --> 34:21.485
You should cool down.

34:21.520 --> 34:24.159
No. Y should_ take this
more seriously.

34:24.190 --> 34:25.521
(phone ringing)

34:25.560 --> 34:26.754
What?

34:26.790 --> 34:30.556
Hey. Is this a bad time?

34:30.600 --> 34:32.568
No. There's no good timing
these days.

34:32.600 --> 34:34.761
How are you?

34:34.800 --> 34:37.132
I'm dropping out.

34:37.170 --> 34:39.138
Oh, Finn.

34:39.170 --> 34:40.159
Are you sure?

34:40.210 --> 34:42.428
Yeah.

34:42.480 --> 34:45.199
Yeah, look, it's-it's...

34:45.250 --> 34:47.275
the right thing to do.

34:47.310 --> 34:49.346
And, you know,
I-I talked to my parents,

34:49.380 --> 34:52.508
and they were both...
really supportive,

34:52.550 --> 34:56.281
but I just don't want them
to suffer anymore, so...

34:56.320 --> 34:58.720
And I heard they're out
to Diane Lockhart.

34:58.760 --> 35:00.728
What?

35:00.760 --> 35:03.593
They've asked Diane
to step in in my stead.

35:08.840 --> 35:11.764
Well. And then
there were two.

35:14.610 --> 35:16.828
I'm amazed by you,
Mr. Canning.

35:16.880 --> 35:20.441
This is your fourth week
at my firm--

35:20.480 --> 35:22.675
a firm that I've built
from the ground up

35:22.720 --> 35:24.278
over the last nine years--

35:24.320 --> 35:26.481
and you're already
knocking at the door

35:26.520 --> 35:27.589
of managing partnership.

35:27.620 --> 35:29.315
I'm knocking,

35:29.360 --> 35:31.487
but I'm afraid
that door's not gonna open.

35:31.530 --> 35:32.883
You have Howard.

35:32.930 --> 35:34.591
You-you have
the votes.

35:34.630 --> 35:37.758
You want some whiskey?
Sure.

35:37.800 --> 35:39.222
My meds are just kicking in.

35:39.270 --> 35:40.589
This could be interesting.

35:40.630 --> 35:43.235
So...

35:43.270 --> 35:45.704
what scheme
do you have for me now?

35:45.740 --> 35:47.605
(laughs)

35:47.640 --> 35:49.608
What scheme?
Yes.

35:49.640 --> 35:53.747
You don't scratch your nose
without there being some plan.

35:53.780 --> 35:57.671
Are you familiar
with the nuclear option?

35:57.720 --> 35:59.779
No.

35:59.820 --> 36:03.711
It's a notice of dissolution.

36:03.760 --> 36:05.625
Readit

36:05.660 --> 36:08.549
As partner, I have
unilateral right to dissolve

36:08.600 --> 36:10.852
the firm... with-with cause.

36:10.900 --> 36:12.868
And what would that cost me?

36:12.900 --> 36:13.821
Acquisitions were made

36:13.870 --> 36:15.599
without the full consent
of the partnership.

36:15.640 --> 36:17.858
The West Coast, East Coast
offices were acquired.

36:17.900 --> 36:20.437
By Will, a partner who is dead.

36:20.470 --> 36:22.802
Unfortunately, the courts
still hold the current managing

36:22.840 --> 36:24.239
partnership
accountable.

36:24.280 --> 36:25.577
Why are you doing this?

36:25.610 --> 36:26.804
Thought that
was clear.

36:26.850 --> 36:29.273
I want to be managing partner.

36:29.320 --> 36:30.446
You're dying.

36:33.920 --> 36:36.650
My work is my life.

36:36.690 --> 36:39.420
If I don't work,
I'll die sooner.

36:39.460 --> 36:41.928
So, if you don't get
the partnership,

36:41.960 --> 36:43.928
you will dissolve this firm?

36:43.960 --> 36:45.723
No, y will
dissolve this firm.

36:45.770 --> 36:47.260
I want this firm to be strong.

36:47.300 --> 36:49.894
I want there to
be... a consensus

36:49.940 --> 36:51.931
going forward.

36:56.310 --> 36:58.870
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

37:10.990 --> 37:12.981
What are you gonna do?

37:15.730 --> 37:19.769
Do you mean, do I let Canning
take the managing partnership,

37:19.800 --> 37:23.395
or fight him and watch
my firm dissolve?

37:24.840 --> 37:27.001
He's right about Will.

37:27.040 --> 37:30.339
The expenditures were
made without a full vote.

37:30.380 --> 37:33.599
There's always
option number three.

37:33.650 --> 37:36.414
You could run
for state's attorney.

37:38.450 --> 37:40.589
I don't think I have the...

37:42.720 --> 37:44.722
the fight left in me, Kalinda.

37:45.860 --> 37:47.828
If Will were still here, I...

37:47.860 --> 37:49.851
I'm here.

37:58.970 --> 38:00.938
You've decided?

38:00.970 --> 38:03.677
Yes.

38:04.780 --> 38:06.805
Good.

38:11.080 --> 38:13.082
I'll be home as soon as I can.
Something just came up.

38:13.120 --> 38:14.985
PETER:
What?

38:15.020 --> 38:18.012
Something important. I'm sorry.

38:18.060 --> 38:20.051
Tell Zach I'll be home
as soon as I can?

38:20.090 --> 38:22.058
Please hurry.

38:22.100 --> 38:25.490
She's playing
you for a fool.

38:25.530 --> 38:28.021
Mother, what does that
even mean?

38:30.470 --> 38:33.507
It means, Alicia wants the power
of your office

38:33.540 --> 38:35.531
without giving anything
in return. She...

38:35.580 --> 38:37.332
Hi, Veronica.

38:37.380 --> 38:41.100
Peter. I thought
I'd put out the lasagna.

38:41.150 --> 38:43.368
Your daughter's going
to be late again. I'd wait.

38:43.420 --> 38:46.014
Well, that's what happens when
you work for a living, Jackie,

38:46.050 --> 38:47.938
a concept that's
probably alien to you.

38:49.760 --> 38:51.387
Bitch.

38:51.430 --> 38:53.853
All right, all right, all right,
please, please, girls.

38:53.890 --> 38:57.758
Thank you for giving me a moment
so late at night.

38:57.800 --> 39:00.689
I, um... I have a proposal
for you to consider.

39:00.730 --> 39:02.436
Diane,

39:02.470 --> 39:04.802
any merger would require
a three-year window on Chumhum.

39:04.840 --> 39:06.637
ALICIA:
Cary, we don't decide

39:06.670 --> 39:09.537
until we vote.
Nothing's deCIded
until we get a proposal.

39:09.580 --> 39:11.377
And I'm saying that a
proposal would require...

39:11.410 --> 39:12.638
You don't have
the right to say...

39:12.680 --> 39:14.102
Alicia, Cary,
why don't we leave it

39:14.150 --> 39:14.969
to our guest to talk?

39:15.020 --> 39:17.079
That's all I wanted.
Alicia. Please.

39:17.120 --> 39:18.485
We're here to listen.

39:20.090 --> 39:22.058
(clears her throat)

39:22.090 --> 39:26.424
I know we've talked a lot
about a merger.

39:26.460 --> 39:29.554
I have my own dissenting voices
at Lockhart/Gardner.

39:29.600 --> 39:33.468
Many don't want
to let you back in the door.

39:33.500 --> 39:35.388
Great.
Cary.

39:35.440 --> 39:37.067
DIANE:
But even if we were
to make a deal

39:37.100 --> 39:41.639
tonight, my concern is that
it would dissolve very quickly.

39:41.680 --> 39:43.170
A merger, I'm afraid,

39:43.210 --> 39:45.178
would make Lockhart/Gardner
unwieldy.

39:45.210 --> 39:47.007
So,

39:47.050 --> 39:49.848
you've come here
to propose not merging?

39:49.880 --> 39:51.848
I don't understand.

39:51.890 --> 39:53.846
No.

39:53.890 --> 39:57.519
I've come_ here to ask
if you Will take me.

40:01.230 --> 40:02.891
Holy crap.

40:02.930 --> 40:04.761
DIANE:
Me.

40:04.800 --> 40:08.463
And my $38 million a year
in client billing.

40:13.910 --> 40:16.071
ELI:
Uh-huh.

40:16.110 --> 40:18.704
Uh-huh.

40:18.750 --> 40:21.048
Are you sure, Diane?

40:22.680 --> 40:25.581
Okay, I'll tell Peter.

40:25.620 --> 40:27.588
Thank you for considering it.

40:27.620 --> 40:29.679
Bye.

40:32.160 --> 40:36.153
Why is everything...
so difficult?

40:39.230 --> 40:41.664
("Pomp and Circumstance" plays,
applause)

40:41.700 --> 40:44.191
MAN (over P.A.):
Raymond Fitzmorris.

40:44.240 --> 40:46.231
(applause)

40:46.270 --> 40:48.135
Anna Fitzpatrick.

40:48.170 --> 40:49.831
(applause)

40:49.880 --> 40:52.075
Zachary Florrick.

40:52.110 --> 40:54.977
(applause)

40:58.180 --> 41:01.047
Addison Garisovic.

41:04.090 --> 41:06.752
Stephanie Green.

41:09.300 --> 41:11.256
ALICIA:
I'm sorry

41:11.300 --> 41:13.518
I was late.
It's fine.
You weren't.

41:13.570 --> 41:15.492
You saw it.
The rest was boring.

41:15.540 --> 41:16.893
I'm so proud of you, Zach.

41:16.940 --> 41:18.191
Thanks, Mom.

41:18.240 --> 41:19.229
(laughs)

41:19.270 --> 41:21.238
You're all packed up?

41:21.270 --> 41:23.602
Uh, yeah. Sam called.
He wants to leave tonight.

41:23.640 --> 41:24.800
What?

41:24.850 --> 41:27.171
Well, just so we can get
a jump on the traffic.

41:27.210 --> 41:28.677
We'll drive through the night,

41:28.720 --> 41:30.938
and we'll get there
tomorrow morning.

41:30.980 --> 41:32.516
You okay with that?

41:32.550 --> 41:34.518
Yeah.

41:34.560 --> 41:36.983
I just wish there was more time.

41:37.020 --> 41:39.853
I'll be home for Thanksgiving.

41:39.890 --> 41:41.858
I love you.

41:41.900 --> 41:43.959
I love you, too.

41:44.000 --> 41:45.991
I'll call you when I get there.

41:47.230 --> 41:49.232
Mmm.

42:23.300 --> 42:26.531
(sighs)
Oh.

42:31.010 --> 42:32.898
It's been a weird day.

42:32.950 --> 42:34.247
Yeah.

42:34.280 --> 42:36.771
Weird year.

43:02.740 --> 43:05.345
Alicia?

43:05.380 --> 43:08.201
Yes?

43:09.050 --> 43:11.985
Would you want to run
for state's attorney?

43:12.020 --> 43:13.817
What?
