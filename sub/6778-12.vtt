HELLO !

01:50.040 --> 01:51.564

01:51.670 --> 01:53.831
IF IT HASN'T WORKED
FOR THE LAST 45 MINUTES,

01:53.940 --> 01:55.305
IT'S NOT
GONNA WORK NOW.

01:55.410 --> 01:58.174
THAT GODDAMN NIGHT GUARD
MUST BE DRUNK AND DEAF.

01:58.280 --> 02:00.510
I'LL TRY
MY PHONE AGAIN.

02:00.620 --> 02:02.076
WE'VE ALREADY
TRIED OUR PHONES.

02:02.190 --> 02:03.282
WE DON'T GET RECEPTION
UP HERE, ALRIGHT ?

02:03.390 --> 02:05.381
JUST WAIT FOR
THE RESCUE TEAMS.

02:10.960 --> 02:12.086
SHIT.

02:12.200 --> 02:13.326
SHIT.

02:13.430 --> 02:15.990
DON'T DO THAT,
YOU COULD MAKE IT WORSE !

02:16.100 --> 02:17.465
WE HAVE
TO DO SOMETHING.

02:17.570 --> 02:19.060
OKAY, LET'S ALL TRY TO PRY
THIS DOOR OPEN ONE MORE TIME.

02:19.170 --> 02:21.138
GIVE IT
EVERYTHING WE GOT.

02:24.510 --> 02:26.831
WERE GONNA DROP 10 FLOORS,
AND WE'RE ALL GONNA DIE !

02:26.940 --> 02:30.546
WE COULD USE A LITTLE MORE
BRUCE WILLIS A'I'I'ITUDE, MISTER.

02:38.190 --> 02:41.455
LEMME OUT, LEMME OUT !

02:41.560 --> 02:43.084
NO WAY, YOU'RE BEING
SO OBNOXIOUS.

02:43.190 --> 02:46.421
GET UP THERE,
WE'LL GIVE YOU A BOOST.

02:50.230 --> 02:51.891
I'LL TAKE THE STAIRS,
I'LL GET SOME HELP--

02:52.000 --> 02:53.297
GOD, WE'RE ALL

02:53.400 --> 02:56.267
STOP IT, STOP IT,

02:56.370 --> 02:57.507

03:40.250 --> 03:42.844

03:44.290 --> 03:45.086
OH, MY GOD !

WHAT HAPPENED !

03:47.760 --> 03:48.988
LET'S BOTH GO.

03:49.090 --> 03:50.182
I THINK WE SHOULD
STAY TOGETHER.

03:50.290 --> 03:51.757
I'M TOO SCARED.

03:55.600 --> 03:57.898
GEORGE, THE GLASS
PUT ON YOUR SLIPPERS.

04:08.040 --> 04:09.598

04:34.640 --> 04:35.891
GEORGE.

04:41.840 --> 04:43.808
WHAT DID YOU DO ?

04:46.110 --> 04:47.543
GEORGE ?

04:53.020 --> 04:55.181
GEORGE ?

04:55.290 --> 04:56.518
GEORGE ?

04:56.630 --> 04:58.029
GEORGE ?

04:59.290 --> 05:00.723
I'M AWAKE.

05:00.830 --> 05:04.596
YOU WERE WHIMPERING
AND PADDLING WITH YOUR FEET.

05:04.700 --> 05:06.668
WHAT WERE YOU
DREAMING ABOUT ?

05:09.100 --> 05:10.601
I DON'T REMEMBER.

05:23.990 --> 05:27.653
( alarm clock)

05:32.460 --> 05:34.519
YEAH, IT'S AT THE BELLANDI
GALLERY DOWNTOWN,

05:34.630 --> 05:37.428
WHERE JIMMY WAS,
YOU GOT MY POSTCARD, RIGHT ?

05:37.530 --> 05:39.464
OKAY, WELL CALL ME
IF YOU DO NEED DIRECTIONS.

05:39.570 --> 05:42.038
ALRIGHT, I'LL
SEE YOU TOMORROW.

05:42.140 --> 05:44.438
OH, BRING COOL PEOPLE.

05:50.280 --> 05:52.771
OH HI, EDIE,
IT'S CLAIRE.

05:54.520 --> 05:55.817
LISTEN, TOMORROW
IS MY SHOW.

05:55.920 --> 05:58.286
I KNOW YOU PROBABLY
WON'T BE THERE BUT--

05:58.390 --> 06:02.349
I WISH YOU
WOULD BE THERE.

06:04.290 --> 06:05.928
OKAY, SHIT,
NEVER MIND.

06:15.540 --> 06:16.962
I BROKE UP
WITH RUSSELL.

06:17.070 --> 06:18.162
WHY ?

06:18.270 --> 06:19.635
WHY DO
YOU THINK ?

06:19.740 --> 06:22.379
HE'S A BIG DRAMA QUEEN,
EVERYTHING'S SO HEAW

06:22.480 --> 06:24.243
AND NEGATIVE, HE'S
SUCH A FUCKING VICTIM.

06:24.350 --> 06:26.648
YEAH, REALLY.

06:26.750 --> 06:29.548
HE GOT IN MY FACE
ABOUT YOUR SHOW.

06:29.650 --> 06:32.483
OH, GOD,
HE'S UNBELIEVABLE.

06:32.590 --> 06:35.559
I WAS LIKE,
"WHOEVER'S IDEA IT WAS

06:35.660 --> 06:37.685
AND I DON'T FUCKING CARE,
CLAIRE RAN WITH IT".

06:37.790 --> 06:40.054
I WAS LIKE,
"ADAPT, DUDE".

06:41.860 --> 06:43.896
THANK YOU
FOR DEFENDING MY HONOR.

06:45.870 --> 06:48.259
HEY, I BROUGHT YOU
A PRESENT.

06:48.370 --> 06:50.565
HAPPY FAME.

06:52.270 --> 06:54.807
OH, MY GOD,
IS THAT COCAINE ?

06:54.910 --> 06:57.276
THIS IS SO DISCO !

06:57.380 --> 06:58.745
LET'S DO
A FEW LINES.

06:58.850 --> 07:01.375
OH SHIT, I WANT TO BUT
I HAVE TO GO TO MY GALLERY

07:01.480 --> 07:03.345
AND MEET SOME
HUGE MOVIE STAR.

07:03.450 --> 07:05.111
SERIOUSLY ?

07:05.220 --> 07:06.517
WHAT MOVIE STAR ?

07:06.620 --> 07:08.315
I DON'T KNOW,
SOME LIKE CELEBRITY WOMAN

07:08.420 --> 07:10.149
WANTS TO BUY
MY STUFF.

07:10.260 --> 07:12.285
YOU'RE GETTING
WAY TOO COOL FOR ME.

07:12.390 --> 07:14.449
FUCK YOU.

07:14.560 --> 07:17.893
NO, IT'S
A FISH TAIL.

07:18.000 --> 07:20.036
IT'S A FISH TAIL !

07:20.140 --> 07:21.289
YES.

07:21.400 --> 07:23.209
I'M CALLING
THE LAWYER AGAIN.

07:23.310 --> 07:24.504
WHERE'S THE PHONE ?

07:24.610 --> 07:25.861
YOU'RE TOO CLEVER,
HE ALREADY TOLD YOU.

07:25.970 --> 07:27.403
YEAH, I KNOW
HE ALREADY SAID THAT

07:27.510 --> 07:29.478
BARB HAS NO
RIGHT TO CUSTODY,

07:29.580 --> 07:31.241
BUT I JUST SAW THIS
ARTICLE ON THE NET--

07:31.350 --> 07:33.443
YOU'RE THE FATHER,
BARB'S THE AUNT,

07:33.550 --> 07:34.812
MAYA'S STAYING
RIGHT HERE WHERE SHE IS.

07:34.920 --> 07:37.980
YOU'RE NOT TAKING
THIS SERIOUSLY.

07:38.090 --> 07:40.308
YES, I AM, BUT IT DOESN'T
DO US ANY GOOD TO LIVE

07:40.420 --> 07:41.887
IN THIS CONSTANT
STATE OF PANIC.

07:41.990 --> 07:43.855
WELL, THAT'S EASY FOR YOU
TO SAY, MAYA'S NOT YOURS.

07:43.960 --> 07:46.224
YES, CAN YOU REACH
MR. SUTCLIFFE FOR ME, PLEASE.

07:46.330 --> 07:48.127
NATE FISHER.

07:48.230 --> 07:49.595
IT'S AN EMERGENCY.

07:49.700 --> 07:51.668
THIS ISN'T ABOUT MAYA,
IT'S ABOUT YOUR EMOTIONS

07:51.770 --> 07:53.260
AND HOW YOU
DEAL WITH THEM.

07:53.370 --> 07:54.394
WILL YOU STOP USING
THE THERAPY VOICE,

07:55.640 --> 07:57.335
HOW WOULD YOU KNOW ?

07:57.440 --> 07:58.236
YOU'VE NEVER
TRIED THERAPY.

07:58.340 --> 07:59.432
I DON'T
NEED THERAPY.

07:59.540 --> 08:01.132
IT'S NOT MY FAULT
THERE'S A DISASTER

08:01.240 --> 08:02.332
EVERY TIME
I BLINK.

08:02.440 --> 08:03.247
WHAT'S WITH
THIS BOOK ?

08:03.350 --> 08:04.499
IT'S MACABRE.

08:04.610 --> 08:05.702
LET'S GET RID OF IT
OR PUT IT AWAY.

08:05.810 --> 08:07.141
MICHAELA GAVE IT TO ME
TO GIVE TO DAVID.

08:07.250 --> 08:08.512
I KEEP FORGE'ITING
ABOUT IT.

08:08.620 --> 08:10.508
I REALLY WISH
YOU'D CONSIDER IT--

08:10.620 --> 08:12.019
LOOK, EVERYTHING
IS UNDER CONTROL !

08:12.120 --> 08:15.089
OF COURSE IT IS.

08:24.200 --> 08:25.497
NUMBER THREE.

08:25.600 --> 08:27.261
EXCUSE ME ?

08:27.370 --> 08:30.009
THAT'S HIM,
NUMBER THREE.

08:34.310 --> 08:35.402
DAVID.

08:35.510 --> 08:37.148
DAVID,
IT'S ALMOST 11.

08:37.250 --> 08:38.000
ARE YOU GOING
TO GET UP ?

08:38.110 --> 08:39.816
YEAH.

08:43.090 --> 08:44.614
WHAT ?

08:44.720 --> 08:48.588
I'M STILL REPLAYING
THAT FUCKING LOOK HE GAVE ME.

08:49.830 --> 08:51.252
DO YOU WANT
TO TALK ABOUT IT ?

08:51.360 --> 08:53.555
NO, I DON'T WANT
TO TALK ABOUT IT.

08:53.660 --> 08:56.561
I'VE TOLD YOU
ABOUT IT 900 TIMES,

08:56.670 --> 08:59.127
I'VE TOLD MY THERAPIST
ABOUT IT 900 TIMES,

08:59.230 --> 09:01.369
I WANT TO FUCKING MOVE ON
AND LEAVE IT BEHIND ME.

09:01.470 --> 09:03.028
SO DO IT.

09:04.070 --> 09:05.002
YOU CAN.

09:05.110 --> 09:06.031
NO, I CAN'T.

09:06.140 --> 09:08.870
I'M FUCKING STUCK.

09:08.980 --> 09:12.279
IF YOU COULD DO ANYTHING,
WHAT WOULD YOU DO ?

09:14.080 --> 09:18.119
I'D TELL HIM WHAT I THINK
OF HIM AND WHAT HE DID TO ME,

09:18.220 --> 09:19.778
THAT EVIL, EVIL FUCK.

09:19.890 --> 09:21.118
WELL, YOU CAN
DO THAT.

09:21.220 --> 09:24.929
I KNOW, I SAID IT ALL
TO THE THERAPY PILLOW.

09:25.030 --> 09:27.555
NO, YOU CAN
VISIT HIM IN JAIL.

09:29.430 --> 09:30.727
WHAT ?!

09:30.830 --> 09:33.492
MAYBE HE'LL SEE YOU, MAYBE
HE WON'T, BUT YOU CAN TRY.

09:33.600 --> 09:35.158
ARE YOU SERIOUS ?

09:35.270 --> 09:36.601
YES, I AM.

09:36.710 --> 09:38.860
I THINK IT WOULD
BE EXTREMELY SELF-DESTRUCT IVE

09:38.970 --> 09:40.699
TO PUT MYSELF
IN THAT SITUATION !

09:40.810 --> 09:43.347
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'D
EVEN SUGGEST IT TO ME.

09:53.220 --> 09:54.778
TWO HOURS, GREAT !

09:54.890 --> 09:57.427
LET ME KNOW WHEN YOU'RE ON THE
GROUND AND I'LL COME MEET YOU.

09:57.530 --> 09:59.589
ME, TOO.

09:59.700 --> 10:02.760
BYE-BYE.

10:09.870 --> 10:12.361
MY DAUGHTER'S ON HER WAY
TO HAWAII FOR A CONFERENCE

10:12.470 --> 10:14.734
AND SHE HAS A LAYOVER
THIS AFTERNOON.

10:14.840 --> 10:18.446
WOULD YOU LIKE
TO MEET HER FOR LUNCH ?

10:18.550 --> 10:20.108
MAGGIE ?

10:20.220 --> 10:21.278
REALLY ?

10:21.380 --> 10:23.109
OH, YES !

10:23.220 --> 10:25.984
THIS IS SO
EXCITING !

10:26.090 --> 10:28.479
WHAT KIND
OF CONFERENCE ?

10:28.590 --> 10:30.057
I DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT HER.

10:30.160 --> 10:31.184
WHAT DOES SHE DO ?

10:31.290 --> 10:32.382
PHARMACEUTICAL REP.

10:32.490 --> 10:33.855
YOU'RE PROUD OF HER,
I CAN TELL.

10:33.960 --> 10:36.724
SHE'S THE APPLE
OF YOUR EYE.

10:38.300 --> 10:40.097
I KNOW YOU'RE DOING
THIS FOR ME, TOO, GEORGE.

10:40.200 --> 10:41.667
THANK YOU.

10:41.770 --> 10:43.169
YOU'LL LIKE HER.

10:43.270 --> 10:45.761
I CAN'T WAIT !

10:49.140 --> 10:51.540
I'M NOT THE PERSON
WHO'S SUPPOSED TO BE HERE,

10:51.650 --> 10:53.914
WE'VE BEEN DIVORCED
FOR AGES.

10:54.020 --> 10:57.979
HE MUST HAVE A NEW WIFE
OR A GIRLFRIEND.

11:00.990 --> 11:02.821
YOU WERE HIS
EMERGENCY CONTACT.

11:02.930 --> 11:05.057
HE WORKED AT THE SAME
PLACE FOR 25 YEARS,

11:05.160 --> 11:07.390
I'M SURE HE JUST FORGOT
TO CHANGE THE FORM.

11:10.500 --> 11:12.024
MAYBE HE STILL
LOVED YOU.

11:14.840 --> 11:16.364
HE'S A VERY
NICE GUY,

11:16.470 --> 11:18.267
BUT YOU KNOW...

11:18.370 --> 11:20.770
I'VE MOVED ON.

11:20.880 --> 11:23.201
WELL, I'M SORRY,
BUT THERE ARE DECISIONS

11:23.310 --> 11:24.709
ABOUT THE FUNERAL
THAT HAVE TO BE MADE.

11:24.810 --> 11:26.277
YES, WELL, I DON'T
WANT TO MAKE THEM !

11:26.380 --> 11:29.747
NOW THERE MUST BE SOMEONE
ELSE WHO CAN DEAL WITH THIS.

11:29.850 --> 11:31.147
'CAUSE I CAN'T
BELIEVE IT !

11:31.250 --> 11:33.650
HOW CAN YOU GET KILLED
BY AN ELEVATOR ?

11:33.760 --> 11:36.149
WELL, THERE WERE THREE
OTHER PEOPLE TRAPPED INSIDE.

11:36.260 --> 11:38.956
AND HE TRIED TO GET THEM OUT AND
THE ELEVATOR TORE HIM IN HALF.

11:40.500 --> 11:42.058
(vomiting )

11:50.440 --> 11:51.634
I HIT A NEW LOW.

11:51.740 --> 11:55.176
I MADE
THE BEREAVED VOMIT.

11:56.610 --> 11:58.373
DON'T TELL ME WE HAVE TO SEND
THIS GUY SOMEWHERE ELSE,

11:58.480 --> 11:59.344
I JUST
EMBALMED HIM.

11:59.450 --> 12:03.147
NO, NO, WE
WORKED IT OUT.

12:03.250 --> 12:05.844
I THINK IT'S WEIRD
WE DON'T SEW HIM TOGETHER.

12:08.060 --> 12:10.153
ONCE HE'S IN THE CASKET,
DRESSED, WITH A LITTLE PADDING,

12:10.260 --> 12:11.454
CAN'T EVEN TELL
THE DIFFERENCE.

12:11.560 --> 12:14.495
HERE, IT'S A PRESENT
FROM MICHAELA.

12:16.330 --> 12:18.594
WHAT A SWEET KID.

12:18.700 --> 12:21.396
LITTLE MORBID,
BUT SWEET.

12:23.270 --> 12:26.307
SO UNLIKE HER MOTHER,
THAT CRAZY BITCH FROM HELL.

12:27.480 --> 12:29.129
WHAT'S THAT ?

12:39.190 --> 12:41.909
( male )
It's Roger Pasquese,
does that ring a bell ?

12:42.790 --> 12:43.722
YEAH.

12:43.830 --> 12:45.855
YEAH, IT DOES.

12:46.630 --> 12:47.995
HOW ARE YOU,
KEITH ?

12:48.100 --> 12:50.261
I'M FINE,
A LITTLE SURPRISED.

12:50.370 --> 12:51.860
HOW ARE YOU ?

12:51.970 --> 12:53.039
I'm well,
thank you.

12:53.140 --> 12:55.461
ENJOYING THE DAY,
CARPE DIEM.

12:55.570 --> 12:57.060
YEAH, THAT'S GREAT.

12:57.170 --> 12:58.137
WHAT'S UP ?

12:58.240 --> 13:01.573
I'm taking a break
from angry ugly white men.

13:01.680 --> 13:03.341
LET'S TAKE IT
EASY NOW, HUH ?

13:03.450 --> 13:06.601
Okay, seriously.

13:06.710 --> 13:08.018
I HAVE A BUSINESS
PROPOSITION FOR YOU

13:08.120 --> 13:10.247
AND I'D LIKE
FOR US TO MEET.

13:10.350 --> 13:11.282
WHAT DO YOU SAY,

13:11.390 --> 13:12.311
YOU COME TO
MY HOUSE AND WE TALK ?

13:12.420 --> 13:13.887
PROBABLY NOT.

13:13.990 --> 13:15.150
NOTHING AGAINST YOU.

13:15.260 --> 13:16.511
IT JUST DOESN'T SEEM LIKE
A VERY GOOD IDEA.

13:16.620 --> 13:18.759
But thanks, anyway.

13:18.860 --> 13:21.920
YOU KNOW, CERTAIN PAPERS
HAVE YET TO BE SIGNED.

13:22.030 --> 13:26.126
Our lawsuit might
rear its ugly head again.

13:27.270 --> 13:29.397
ROGER, WE HAD
AN AGREEMENT.

13:29.500 --> 13:32.799
I DON'T THINK A BLOWJOB
IS LEGAL OR BINDING.

13:32.910 --> 13:34.468
How about
tomorrow afternoon ?

13:34.580 --> 13:35.808
I'LL THINK
ABOUT IT.

13:35.910 --> 13:39.073
WELL, YOU SEE NICOLE,
CLAIRE HAS A PLURALITY

13:39.180 --> 13:42.308
OF INFLUENCES
AT WORK HERE.

13:42.420 --> 13:45.116
THEY'RE PORTRAITS,
AN ANCIENT, CLASSICAL FORM,

13:45.220 --> 13:47.586
AND THEY'RE PHOTOGRAPHS,
WHICH ARE ESSENTIALLY MODERN.

13:47.690 --> 13:49.351
AND THEN THEY'RE
TORN TO BITS.

13:49.460 --> 13:52.588
A NOD TO THE DADAISTS,
AND THE CUBISTS AS WELL.

13:52.690 --> 13:54.897
THEN THE PIECES
ARE REASSEMBLED

13:55.000 --> 13:58.891
FOR A DECONSTRUCTED MIX
OF DETACHMENT AND TENDERNESS

13:59.000 --> 14:03.004
WHICH SEEMS TO ME TO BE
VERY NEW MILLENNIUM.

14:04.140 --> 14:06.608
ANYTHING YOU'D
LIKE TO ADD, CLAIRE ?

14:08.440 --> 14:10.579
UM, WELL...

14:12.310 --> 14:14.915
WHAT YOU SAID
IS PART OF IT.

14:16.550 --> 14:18.518
OF COURSE, IT'S MORE
INVOLVED THAN THAT--

14:18.620 --> 14:20.952
I TOTALLY GET IT.

14:21.060 --> 14:26.657
IT REMINDS ME OF PAPER DOLLS
AND BAD RELATIONSHIPS

14:26.760 --> 14:29.422
AND LIES PEOPLE TELL
ABOUT STUPID THINGS.

14:29.530 --> 14:31.327
RIGHT ?

14:31.430 --> 14:32.590
RIGHT.

14:32.700 --> 14:34.964
IS THIS ALL
YOU HAVE ?

14:35.070 --> 14:37.061
AS A MATTER OF FACT,

14:37.170 --> 14:39.866
SHE'S WORKING HARD
ON A WHOLE NEW SERIES.

14:39.980 --> 14:41.572
IT LOOKS
VERY PROMISING.

14:41.680 --> 14:43.545
COOL, WHEN
CAN I SEE IT ?

14:45.910 --> 14:46.706
SOON.

14:46.810 --> 14:47.913
VERY SOON.

14:48.020 --> 14:50.079
I HAVE TO FIGURE
OUT SOME STUFF.

14:51.320 --> 14:54.312
WE USED TO COME TO
THIS PLACE WHEN I WAS A GIRL.

14:54.420 --> 14:57.628
SARAH AND I WOULD EAT THOUSAND
ISLAND DRESSING ALL BY ITSELF.

14:58.760 --> 15:00.296
WHAT A TREAT !

15:00.400 --> 15:01.856
I LIKE THIS PLACE.

15:01.960 --> 15:04.497
THE MENU
NEVER CHANGES

15:04.600 --> 15:07.433
AND THIS BUILDING HAS STOOD
THROUGH ALL THE MUDSLIDES,

15:07.540 --> 15:09.064
FIRES, EARTHQUAKES.

15:09.170 --> 15:11.206
YES,
IT'S COM FORTING.

15:13.480 --> 15:14.299
MAGGIE !

15:14.410 --> 15:15.900
DADDY !

15:19.810 --> 15:20.845
HI!

15:20.950 --> 15:24.010
OH, SWEETIE, IT'S
GREAT TO SEE YOU.

15:24.120 --> 15:26.987
THIS IS WONDERFUL.

15:34.130 --> 15:36.223
WITH MANAGED CARE
THE WAY THAT IT IS,

15:36.330 --> 15:39.060
MOST OF THESE SAMPLES THAT
I HAUL AROUND END UP

15:39.170 --> 15:42.094
GOING TO PATIENTS WHO CAN'T
AFFORD TO PAY FOR PRESCRIPTIONS,

15:42.200 --> 15:46.068
SO EVERYBODY AT THE DOCTOR'S
OFFICE IS GLAD TO SEE MAGGIE.

15:48.280 --> 15:50.475
SO, WHAT'S NEW
IN ANTIBIOTICS ?

15:54.820 --> 15:56.981
A COURSE OF THIS WILL
KNOCK OUT JUST ABOUT ANYTHING.

15:57.090 --> 15:58.182
BUT YOU HAVE TO TAKE
THE WHOLE SEVEN DAYS.

15:58.290 --> 16:00.281
HUH, ANY SIDE EFFECTS ?

16:00.390 --> 16:03.382
MINIMAL, MAYBE A LITTLE NAUSEA,
SO TAKE IT WITH FOOD.

16:03.490 --> 16:05.287
THANKS, HON.

16:05.390 --> 16:06.948
ARE YOU SICK ?

16:07.630 --> 16:09.894
NO.

16:10.000 --> 16:12.195
I JUST WANT
TO BE PREPARED.

16:12.300 --> 16:15.633
OF COURSE THESE THINGS
WON'T TOUCH ANYTHING VIRAL.

16:15.740 --> 16:18.436
DID YOU KNOW THAT YOU
CAN ORDER POTASSIUM IODIDE

16:18.540 --> 16:19.962
OFF THE INTERNET NOW ?

16:20.080 --> 16:21.308
OH, THAT'S GREAT.

16:21.410 --> 16:23.970
THAT IS SO MUCH
MORE CONVENIENT.

16:26.110 --> 16:28.374
WHAT'S POTASSIUM
IODIDE ?

16:28.480 --> 16:30.584
ANTI-RADIATION.

16:30.690 --> 16:33.011
IF YOU TAKE IT IN TIME,
IT BLOCKS THE THYROID'S UPTAKE

16:33.120 --> 16:37.250
OF AIRBORNE RADIOACTIVE IODINE
FROM A NUCLEAR ACCIDENT.

16:37.360 --> 16:39.248
LET'S NOT WORRY
TODAY, DAD.

16:40.060 --> 16:41.652
WE'RE OKAY TODAY.

16:42.960 --> 16:45.064
OF COURSE WE ARE.

16:52.270 --> 16:55.034
OKAY, I'D LIKE TO TALK
ABOUT THIS MORNING.

16:56.040 --> 16:58.008
WHAT ABOUT IT ?

16:58.110 --> 17:00.169
WELL, BESIDES THE FACT
THAT YOUR ATTITUDE TO THERAPY

17:00.280 --> 17:01.747
IS TOTALLY MEDIEVAL.

17:02.920 --> 17:06.117
YOU HAVE REALLY
BIG EMOTIONS,

17:06.220 --> 17:08.586
NATE, AND THEY'RE NOT
THAT EASY TO LIVE WITH.

17:08.690 --> 17:11.158
YOU KNOW ?

17:11.260 --> 17:12.420
SOMETIMES YOU DUMP THEM
ALL ON ME AND IT'S NOT FAIR.

17:12.530 --> 17:15.158
WELL, MAYBE IF
I GOT A LITTLE SUPPORT

17:15.260 --> 17:16.420
FOR WHAT I'M
GOING THROUGH

17:16.530 --> 17:17.861
THAT'S NOT HOW
I WOULD FEEL TO YOU--

17:17.970 --> 17:19.221
YOU HAVE GOT TO BE
KIDDING, RIGHT ?

17:19.330 --> 17:20.763
ALL I DO
IS SUPPORT YOU.

17:20.870 --> 17:22.462
IT'S LIKE
A FULL-TIME JOB.

17:24.370 --> 17:25.735
WHAT ARE YOU
LOOKING AT ?

17:33.880 --> 17:36.314
I CAN'T COMPETE
WITH A DEAD WOMAN.

17:49.000 --> 17:51.321
BRIAN AND I
JUST ADORED HIM.

17:51.430 --> 17:53.569
HE TOOK US
HIKING, CAMPING--

17:53.670 --> 17:55.934
CAMPING ?

17:56.040 --> 17:57.598
I LOVE CAMPING !

17:57.710 --> 17:59.234
WE'LL HAVE
TO GO, TOO.

17:59.340 --> 18:01.433
HE TAUGHT US
CAMPFIRE SONGS--

18:01.540 --> 18:03.405
CAM PFIRE SONGS ?

18:03.510 --> 18:04.647
YOU ?

18:04.750 --> 18:05.500
YEAH, A COUPLE.

18:05.610 --> 18:06.872
REMEMBER ?

18:06.980 --> 18:11.349
* ABOVE THE PLAIN
OF GOLD AND GREEN *

18:11.450 --> 18:14.886
* A YOUNG BOY'S HEAD
IS PLAINLY SEEN *

18:14.990 --> 18:17.925
* A-HOO-YA,
HOO-YA, HOO-YA-YA *

18:18.030 --> 18:19.179
* SWIFTLY FLOWING RIVER

18:19.290 --> 18:20.757
* A-HOO-YA, HOO-YA,
HOO-YA-YA *

18:20.860 --> 18:22.725
* SWIFTLY FLOWING RIVER

18:22.830 --> 18:25.094
IT WAS KID HEAVEN.

18:25.200 --> 18:26.269
GEORGE.

18:26.370 --> 18:28.736
IF YOU LADIES
WILL EXCUSE ME.

18:37.480 --> 18:39.107
WELL, THANK GOD
HE SHAVED FOR YOU.

18:39.210 --> 18:42.611
HE USED TO HAVE
A BIG SCRAGGLY BEARD.

18:42.720 --> 18:44.381
A BEARD ?

18:44.490 --> 18:46.344
I CAN'T
PICTURE IT.

18:47.860 --> 18:49.555
WELL, YES, I CAN.

18:49.660 --> 18:50.820
EXACTLY.

18:50.930 --> 18:55.492
HE LOOKED LIKE HE JUST
WALKED OUT OF THE BIBLE.

18:59.970 --> 19:01.767
SO HOW'S
HE BEEN ?

19:01.870 --> 19:03.565
FINE.

19:04.310 --> 19:06.198
NO PROBLEMS ?

19:06.940 --> 19:08.737
YOU CAN TELL ME.

19:09.640 --> 19:11.744
WHAT DO YOU MEAN ?

19:20.420 --> 19:22.559
RUTH, I WANT YOU
TO HAVE ALL MY NUMBERS.

19:23.490 --> 19:25.685
IF YOU NEED ME,
CALL.

19:25.790 --> 19:29.055
ANYWHERE, ANYTIME.

19:29.160 --> 19:30.889
WELL, THANK YOU.

19:31.000 --> 19:32.888
HE TRUSTS ME.

19:39.810 --> 19:41.232
Do you mind ifI ask
you a personal question ?

19:41.340 --> 19:42.932
If it isn't
too personal.

19:43.040 --> 19:44.109
Are those whiskers
your own ?

19:44.210 --> 19:45.768
No one else
has claimed them.

19:45.880 --> 19:48.417
DO YOU THINK
I SHOULD ?

19:48.520 --> 19:52.286
I CAN'T TELL YOU
WHAT TO DO.

19:52.390 --> 19:55.484
WHAT DO YOU MEAN ?

19:55.590 --> 19:56.852
YOU LOVE TO TELL
ME WHAT TO DO.

19:56.960 --> 19:59.326
THIS IS DIFFERENT.

20:05.170 --> 20:07.092
MAYBE IF I SEE HIM
AND TELL HIM HOW I FEEL,

20:07.200 --> 20:08.235
I CAN FINALLY
GET MY BALLS BACK.

20:08.340 --> 20:10.194
YOU HAVE BALLS.

20:10.310 --> 20:12.961
YEAH, YEAH.

20:14.480 --> 20:18.940
LOOK, IF YOU DECIDE TO GO,
I'LL GO WITH YOU.

20:19.050 --> 20:21.814
NO, I HAVE TO HANDLE
THIS ALONE.

20:21.920 --> 20:22.909
I'M GOING.

20:23.020 --> 20:24.749
I JUST SAID--

20:24.850 --> 20:26.215
I KNOW WHAT
YOU SAID.

20:26.320 --> 20:27.787
THE SAME THING YOU SAID
WHEN I WAS ON THE ROAD.

20:27.890 --> 20:28.982
"I'M FINE, I'M FINE,"

20:29.090 --> 20:30.421
BUT YOU WEREN'T.

20:30.530 --> 20:32.748
YOU WEREN'T
HONEST WITH ME.

20:34.660 --> 20:37.026
I WASN'T HONEST
WITH MYSELF.

20:37.130 --> 20:38.529
I DID THE BEST
I COULD.

20:38.630 --> 20:39.562
I KNOW.

20:39.670 --> 20:41.490
BUT, I STILL DON'T
KNOW WHEN TO BELIEVE YOU

20:41.600 --> 20:43.465
AND I'M NOT
TAKING ANY CHANCES.

20:52.850 --> 20:54.044
OH, COME ON,
GUYS.

20:55.520 --> 20:56.873
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
HELPING ME OUT HERE.

20:56.980 --> 20:58.015
AND YOU'RE SITTING
TOO CLOSE TO THAT TELEVISION.

20:58.120 --> 20:59.439
GET AWAY FROM IT.

21:02.390 --> 21:03.379
GARBAGEMAN, C'MON !

21:03.490 --> 21:05.754
COME HELP
MOMMY OUT.

21:05.860 --> 21:07.953
YES, VERY GOOD.

21:08.060 --> 21:09.288
THANK YOU.

21:22.310 --> 21:24.847
WOULD YOU TURN OFF
THE LIGHT AND GO TO SLEEP ?

21:26.850 --> 21:28.010
I CAN'T.

21:28.120 --> 21:31.715
YES, YOU CAN, IF YOU QUIT
SUCKIN' WEED AND LIE DOWN.

21:31.820 --> 21:34.983
I HAVE TO MAKE SURE
I INVITED EVERYBODY ON MY LIST.

21:35.090 --> 21:37.388
I'M NOT TIRED,
I'M ALL BUZZY.

21:39.130 --> 21:40.529
DID YOU GET INTO
THAT BLOW WITHOUT ME ?

21:40.630 --> 21:43.565
NO, LOOK, IT'S MY
FIRST EXHIBITION,

21:43.670 --> 21:44.967
THERE'S ALL
THIS STRESS.

21:45.070 --> 21:46.799
CLAIRE.

21:46.900 --> 21:48.333
ONE NIGHT.

21:48.440 --> 21:50.601
SOME PICTURES.

21:50.710 --> 21:52.166
A PARTY.

21:52.270 --> 21:54.374
I THINK YOU
CAN DEAL.

22:19.000 --> 22:20.433
( giggling )

22:38.750 --> 22:40.149
HEY, BREN !

22:40.250 --> 22:41.478
SHHH, MAYA'S
STILL ASLEEP.

22:41.590 --> 22:43.683
CHECK THIS OUT,
THIS IS WHAT LISA WORE.

22:43.790 --> 22:45.155
WELL, YEAH.

22:45.260 --> 22:46.784
NO, NO, NO,
WHEN SHE DIED.

22:46.890 --> 22:48.892
SHE BOUGHT THIS SHIRT
A WEEK BEFORE SHE DIED.

22:49.000 --> 22:49.955
OH, NATE.

22:50.060 --> 22:51.061
NO, I KNOW IT.

22:51.170 --> 22:52.068
DON'T DO THIS
TO YOURSELF.

22:52.170 --> 22:53.296
SHE SHOWED
IT TO ME.

22:53.400 --> 22:54.139
SHE ASKED ME IF
I LIKED THE COLOR.

22:54.240 --> 22:55.537
THIS IS THE SHIRT.

22:55.640 --> 22:57.096
AND THIS IS THE BEACH
WHERE SHE DISAPPEARED.

22:57.200 --> 22:58.963
SO, HOW CAN MICHAELA HAVE
SENT ME THIS PICTURE OF LISA

22:59.070 --> 23:02.073
AT THIS BEACH WHEN LISA
NEVER MADE IT TO SANTA CRUZ ?

23:02.180 --> 23:03.408
I DON'T KNOW.

23:03.510 --> 23:04.602
THERE'S PROBABLY
A SIMPLE EXPLANATION.

23:04.710 --> 23:05.972
THEN I WANT
TO FUCKING HEAR IT.

23:06.080 --> 23:07.104
I'M GOING UP THERE.

23:07.210 --> 23:08.609
OH, GOD, THIS IS NEVER
GOING TO END.

23:10.620 --> 23:11.882
DON'T YOU FUCKING REALIZE
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE ?

23:11.990 --> 23:13.218
THERE WAS SOMEBODY
THERE WITH HER.

23:13.320 --> 23:14.287
SOMEBODY TOOK
THIS PICTURE.

23:14.390 --> 23:15.709
OKAY, LOOK.

23:15.820 --> 23:17.856
WHY DON'T YOU CALL THE LITTLE
GIRL AND JUST ASK HER ?

23:17.960 --> 23:20.952
I'M GOING UP THERE.

23:21.060 --> 23:22.049
I CAN'T JUST CALL.

23:22.160 --> 23:23.661
THE WAY THEY
FEEL ABOUT ME.

23:23.770 --> 23:24.919
DO YOU REALLY THINK THEY'RE
GOING TO GIVE HER THE PHONE

23:25.030 --> 23:26.691
AND SAY, "HERE, MICHAELA,
RE'S UNCLE NATE".

23:26.800 --> 23:27.869
YEAH, HOW DO YOU THINK
THEY'RE GOING TO FEEL ABOUT YOU

23:27.970 --> 23:29.062
WHEN YOU JUST TURN UP
OUT OF NOWHERE,

23:29.170 --> 23:30.068
SOUNDING LIKE
A CRAZY MAN ?

23:30.170 --> 23:31.501
OH, THANKS FOR
THE SUPPORT.

23:31.610 --> 23:32.634
THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT
I'M FUCKING TALKING ABOUT.

23:32.740 --> 23:33.832
OH, COME ON,
THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

23:33.940 --> 23:35.100
YOU'RE DRIVING
UP THERE ALL BECAUSE

23:35.210 --> 23:36.336
OF SOME
RAN DOM SNAPSHOT--

23:36.440 --> 23:38.101
I DON'T NEED
YOUR PERMISSION.

23:38.210 --> 23:39.472
NO, YOU DON'T.

23:39.580 --> 23:40.808
YEAH, I DON'T.

23:40.920 --> 23:42.478
SO I'M GONNA MAYA
TO MY MOTHER'S HOUSE.

23:43.080 --> 23:44.445
WHY ?

23:47.820 --> 23:50.926
WELL, BECAUSE SHE'S
NEVER SPENT THE NIGHT...

23:51.960 --> 23:53.222
HERE WITHOUT ME--

23:53.330 --> 23:54.729
NATE, IF YOU DON'T THINK
THAT I CAN TAKE CARE OF MAYA,

23:54.830 --> 23:56.297
THERE'S NOT REALLY
A WHOLE LOT OF POINT

23:56.400 --> 23:58.129
TO THE THREE OF US
LIVING TOGETHER.

24:02.370 --> 24:04.008
OKAY, I'M SORRY.

24:07.410 --> 24:08.968
I'M SORRY.

24:11.980 --> 24:13.538
I HAVE TO DO THIS.

24:20.390 --> 24:24.053
ERY DAY IT SEEMS
HARDER TO BREATHE.

24:25.590 --> 24:27.649
IS THAT
MY IMAGINATION ?

24:27.760 --> 24:29.398
NO.

24:29.500 --> 24:32.594
THE AIR IS POISONED,
GEORGE.

24:32.700 --> 24:35.760
IT'S A SCIENTIFIC FACT.

24:35.870 --> 24:37.599
THEY TOOK BLOOD SAMPLES
FROM A REMOTE VILLAGE

24:37.710 --> 24:41.430
OF INDIANS
IN BOLIVIA.

24:41.540 --> 24:44.202
ALTO LOS ZARZOS.

24:44.310 --> 24:45.846
EVEN THEY WERE
CONTAMINATED.

24:45.950 --> 24:48.510
THERE ARE CHEMICALS
IN THE RAIN.

24:50.320 --> 24:52.743
I KEEP THINKING ANY MINUTE
SOMETHING TERRIBLE WILL HAPPEN.

24:52.850 --> 24:55.512
IT'S ALREADY
HAPPENING.

24:55.620 --> 24:58.953
YES, I KNOW, BUT--

24:59.060 --> 24:59.879
OUR DAYS ARE NUMBERED.

24:59.990 --> 25:02.220
IT'S ONLY
A MATTER OF TIME.

25:02.330 --> 25:06.118
BUT I TRULY BELIEVE
IF WE PREPARE--

25:06.230 --> 25:07.697
DON'T BE NAIVE,
GEORGE.

25:07.800 --> 25:09.131
YOU WEREN'T
BROUGHT UP THAT WAY.

25:09.240 --> 25:11.538
THERE'S NO HOPE.

25:11.640 --> 25:14.370
STOP SAYING THAT !

25:14.480 --> 25:18.007
EVEN IF IT'S TRUE,
I CAN'T GIVE UP.

25:22.520 --> 25:23.782
NO.

25:24.620 --> 25:26.178
NO, I WON'T.

25:48.180 --> 25:49.101
ARE YOU ALRIGHT ?

25:49.210 --> 25:50.029
YES.

25:50.140 --> 25:52.779
NO.

25:53.950 --> 25:56.271
COULD YOU...

25:56.380 --> 25:58.086
COULD YOU
SIT WITH ME ?

26:00.190 --> 26:01.179
OKAY.

26:09.330 --> 26:10.456
THE WAY HE DIED,
OH GOD.

26:10.560 --> 26:12.892
GOD, IT'S AWFUL.

26:13.000 --> 26:15.730
I CAN'T STOP
THINKING ABOUT IT.

26:15.840 --> 26:19.435
IF THERE WAS ANYONE WHO
DESERVED TO GO IN THEIR SLEEP,

26:19.540 --> 26:22.179
IT WAS KEN.

26:23.710 --> 26:27.498
IT'S THE WAY THAT KEN
LIVED THAT'S IMPORTANT.

26:27.620 --> 26:29.144
WE WEREN'T CLOSE
ANYMORE.

26:32.890 --> 26:34.619
HE WAS YOUR
HUSBAND ONCE.

26:34.720 --> 26:36.688
15 YEARS AGO.

26:36.790 --> 26:40.578
HONESTLY, WHEN I GOT
THE CALL, I HAD TO THINK,

26:40.700 --> 26:43.123
"KEN, KEN WHO" ?

26:46.000 --> 26:50.562
THEN I REMEMBERED,
EVERY MINUTE WE SPENT TOGETHER,

26:50.670 --> 26:53.161
I REMEMBER EVERYTHING.

26:55.210 --> 26:58.805
I'M GOING TO BURY HIM
WITH THE REST OF MY FAMILY.

27:00.920 --> 27:02.945
THAT'S THE WAY IT SHOULD BE,
DON'T YOU THINK ?

27:03.050 --> 27:06.383
YES, YES, I DO.

27:06.490 --> 27:07.980
EVEN IF
I MARRY AGAIN...

27:08.090 --> 27:12.823
WHEN I'M DEAD
I WANT KEN THERE, TOO.

27:13.660 --> 27:14.592
FAMILY'S FAMILY.

27:14.700 --> 27:16.429
DIVORCE DOESN'T
CHANGE THAT.

27:16.530 --> 27:20.364
NOT DIVORCE, NOT DEATH,
NOT ANYTHING.

27:20.470 --> 27:23.564
WHEN PEOPLE...

27:23.670 --> 27:26.332
GET IN YOUR HEART ?

27:26.440 --> 27:28.237
THEY STAY
FOR GOOD.

27:40.960 --> 27:42.188
MAGGIE,
THIS IS RUTH.

27:42.290 --> 27:43.928
I'M VERY SORRY TO BOTHER
YOU IN WAIKIKI,

27:44.030 --> 27:45.884
BUT PLEASE
CALL ME BACK.

27:45.990 --> 27:49.892
I'M WORRIED
ABOUT YOUR FATHER.

27:57.170 --> 27:58.262
MR. FISHER.

28:03.080 --> 28:04.502
Could I see a yalid
passport, a Visa,

28:04.610 --> 28:05.804
alien registration card

28:05.910 --> 28:07.309
or _va|id California
driver's license ?

28:16.660 --> 28:17.979
YOU MAY TAKE IN
ONE HANDKERCHIEF,

28:18.090 --> 28:19.489
AN UNOPENED
PACK OF TISSUE,

28:19.590 --> 28:21.251
$30 IN COIN AND
ONE-DOLLAR BILLS ONLY.

28:21.360 --> 28:24.659
You may not take in cameras,
cell phones unless approved

28:24.770 --> 28:26.192
prior to entering
the visiting room.

28:26.300 --> 28:29.167
I don't
have anything.

28:29.270 --> 28:33.058
Are you wearing implants
or prosthetic devices ?

28:33.170 --> 28:36.731
No.

28:36.840 --> 28:39.047
PLEASE PROCEED DOWN
THE HALL TO THE NEXT OFFICER,

28:39.150 --> 28:41.311
He'll direct you
to the metal detector.

28:42.380 --> 28:43.881
( buzzer )

28:48.720 --> 28:51.325
SIR, PLEASE PROCEED
DOWN THE HALL.

29:09.840 --> 29:11.478
GOD, WHAT IF A LOT
OF PEOPLE COME ?

29:11.580 --> 29:12.808
THEY'RE ALL GOING
TO BE LOOKING AT ME.

29:12.910 --> 29:14.514
ISN'T THAT
WHAT YOU WANT ?

29:14.620 --> 29:16.645
I DON'T KNOW,
I HAVEN'T DONE MUCH COKE.

29:16.750 --> 29:19.116
I DON'T WANT IT TO MAKE ME
MORE NERVOUS THAN I ALREADY AM.

29:19.220 --> 29:20.744
NO, IT'LL HELP.

29:20.860 --> 29:21.986
THIS SHIT'S NOT CUT WITH METH,
IT'S PRETTY SMOOTH.

29:22.090 --> 29:23.751
IT MAKES YOU FEEL
REALLY IMPORTANT

29:23.860 --> 29:25.259
FOR ABOUT
20 MINUTES.

29:27.030 --> 29:28.327
GIMME.

29:32.670 --> 29:33.796
I'LL HANG ONTO IT
IF YOU WANT.

29:33.900 --> 29:34.992
I THOUGHT
IT WAS A PRESENT.

29:35.100 --> 29:36.965
IT IS, BUT SINCE
IT'S YOUR SPECIAL NIGHT,

29:37.070 --> 29:39.129
I COULD BE LIKE
THE KEEPER OF IT.

29:42.210 --> 29:42.733
OH.

29:42.840 --> 29:44.000
YEAH ?

29:44.110 --> 29:44.974
OKAY.

29:45.080 --> 29:46.775
NICE.

29:55.220 --> 29:55.811
WHAT ?

29:55.920 --> 29:57.751
I JUST WANT
TO LOOK.

29:57.860 --> 29:59.157
WHATEVER,

29:59.260 --> 30:00.955
I'LL MEET YOU BACK HERE
IN A HALF HOUR FOR A LITTLE.

30:01.060 --> 30:02.948
OKAY.

30:11.340 --> 30:13.001
YOU KNOW, THE BOYS AREN'T HERE,
THEY'RE AT A BIRTHDAY PARTY.

30:13.110 --> 30:16.238
BUT IF YOU CALL,
YOU COULD PROBABLY STOP OVER.

30:20.150 --> 30:22.914
IT'S YOU
I CAME TO SEE.

30:23.820 --> 30:25.412
WELL,
I GOTTA GO SOON.

30:28.560 --> 30:29.857
OKAY.

30:38.570 --> 30:40.060
VANESSA...

30:45.970 --> 30:47.267
THIS IS ALL
MY FAULT.

30:47.370 --> 30:50.476
ALL MY FAULT.

30:52.610 --> 30:58.219
WHAT I GAVE SOPHIA,
THE TIME AND THE ATTENTION--

30:58.320 --> 30:59.912
MONEY.

31:00.020 --> 31:01.487
THE INTIMACY.

31:01.590 --> 31:04.024
I HAD NO RIGHT.

31:04.130 --> 31:06.348
IT ALL BELONGED
TO YOU AND THE KIDS.

31:08.230 --> 31:11.620
EVEN IF YOU HADN'T SLEPT
WITH HER, IT WAS ADULTERY.

31:15.600 --> 31:16.999
BEING CLOSE
TO SOMEBODY ELSE

31:17.100 --> 31:18.431
WHEN YOU'RE THE MOST
IMPORTANT PERSON IN MY LIFE,

31:18.540 --> 31:21.304
YES, THAT
WAS ADULTERY.

31:23.110 --> 31:26.409
I BETRAYED
MY MARRIAGE.

31:27.450 --> 31:29.042
I WAS SO WRONG

31:30.450 --> 31:32.611
AND I'M SO SORRY FROM
THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART.

31:39.490 --> 31:40.752
YOU FINALLY SAID IT.

31:40.860 --> 31:42.020
THANK YOU.

31:45.000 --> 31:46.888
SO, I'LL COME BACK HOME
AND WE'LL GO BACK

31:47.000 --> 31:48.365
TO BEING OURSELVES
AGAIN, OKAY ?

31:57.010 --> 31:59.069
WE CAN'T GO BACK.

31:59.750 --> 32:02.378
EVERYTHING IS CHANGED.

32:02.480 --> 32:06.484
I NEVER EXPECTED THIS,
AND I FEEL REALLY SAD,

32:07.150 --> 32:09.482
BUT IT FEELS RIGHT.

32:13.490 --> 32:14.889
NO.

32:15.000 --> 32:16.888
YOU KNOW THAT WE GOT
TOGETHER SO YOUNG.

32:17.000 --> 32:19.798
BEING ON MY OWN
IS GOOD FOR ME NOW.

32:19.900 --> 32:22.095
AND I THINK THAT MAYBE
IT'S GOOD FOR YOU, TOO.

32:23.470 --> 32:25.006
NO.

32:25.110 --> 32:28.307
NO, NO, IT IS
DEFINITELY NOT GOOD.

32:29.810 --> 32:31.505
DON'T YOU LOVE
ME ANYMORE ?

32:31.610 --> 32:33.271
OF COURSE
I LOVE YOU.

32:36.420 --> 32:38.581
IT'S JUST NOT
LIKE BEFORE.

32:40.620 --> 32:41.882
OH, JESUS.

32:41.990 --> 32:44.481
I'M NOT TRYING TO HURT YOU,
RICO, I SWEAR TO GOD.

32:48.760 --> 32:50.648
I WANT AIVORCE.

32:55.540 --> 32:57.064
YOU DON'T MEAN IT.

32:58.770 --> 33:00.306
YOU DON'T MEAN IT.

33:08.880 --> 33:11.087
( door slams )

33:28.600 --> 33:29.635
WHO ARE YOU ?

33:31.870 --> 33:34.077
DAVID FISHER.

33:34.180 --> 33:35.704
REMEMBER ME ?

33:38.710 --> 33:42.077
YEAH, I THINK SO.

33:44.450 --> 33:46.111
HOW YA DOING ?

33:47.420 --> 33:49.354
HOW DO YOU
THINK I AM ?

33:50.460 --> 33:51.586
I DON'T KNOW.

33:51.690 --> 33:55.251
YOU LOOK PRETTY GOOD COMPARED
TO EVERYBODY ELSE I SEE.

33:59.730 --> 34:02.039
I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY HERE
BEHIND BARS WHERE YOU BELONG.

34:02.140 --> 34:05.166
NOBODY BELONGS
HERE, MAN.

34:06.940 --> 34:09.704
YOU EVER BEEN
THROUGH DETOX ?

34:09.810 --> 34:11.698
IT'S LIKE DYING.

34:11.810 --> 34:14.574
EVERY FUCKING
MINUTE YOU DIE.

34:14.680 --> 34:17.649
GOOD.

34:17.750 --> 34:20.844
DID YOU BRING
ME SOMETHING ?

34:20.950 --> 34:23.817
NO, I HATE YOU.

34:23.920 --> 34:27.026
OH, GOD
HERE WE GO.

34:27.130 --> 34:28.995
YOU SOAKED ME
WITH GASOLINE,

34:29.100 --> 34:31.159
YOU BEAT ME AND STUCK
A GUN IN MY MOUTH.

34:31.270 --> 34:35.195
WELL, YEAH, YOU DROVE ME ALL
OVER HELL WITH A DEAD CHICK

34:35.300 --> 34:37.860
FARTING IN THE BACK OF YOUR VAN,
WHAT WAS I SUPPOSED TO DO ?

34:37.970 --> 34:39.631
YOU SCARED ME
SHITLESS.

34:39.740 --> 34:42.937
NOW I WALK AROUND ALL
THE TIME FEELING LIKE

34:43.040 --> 34:44.109
EVERYBODY'S GONNA
HUMILIATE AND MURDER ME.

34:44.210 --> 34:46.269
WELL, THEY ARE.

34:46.380 --> 34:47.608
SO I DID
YOU A FAVOR.

34:47.710 --> 34:50.417
NOW YOU'LL BE A LITTLE
MORE CAREFUL, WON'T YOU ?

34:50.520 --> 34:53.648
STOP YOUR FUCKING GAMES
FOR ONCE, YOU GODDAMN--

34:53.750 --> 34:55.251
IT'S YOUR GAME.

34:55.360 --> 34:56.349
YOU COME HERE AND YOU VISIT ME
AND YOU DON'T BRING ANYTHING,

34:56.460 --> 34:57.859
YOU JUST WANT
TO SHIT ON ME

34:57.960 --> 35:00.679
AND BREAK ME DOWN,
LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE.

35:00.790 --> 35:01.654
WELL, I WON'T
LET YOU.

35:01.760 --> 35:02.897
APOLOGIZE TO ME.

35:03.000 --> 35:04.467
FOR DEFENDING MYSELF ?

35:04.570 --> 35:06.128
FUCK YOU.

35:09.800 --> 35:11.506
YOU HAVE A FAMILY,
RIGHT ?

35:13.210 --> 35:15.906
YOU HAVE PEOPLE
LOOKING OUT FOR YOU ?

35:16.010 --> 35:18.376
YEAH, BUT--

35:18.480 --> 35:20.607
ALL I HAVE IS YOU,
DAVID, AND YOU HATE ME.

35:20.710 --> 35:23.713
YOU MADE A SPECIAL TRIP UP HERE
TO TELL ME THAT YOU HATE ME.

35:23.820 --> 35:27.745
I THINK I'M THE ONE THAT
DESERVES A GODDAMN APOLOGY.

35:32.990 --> 35:35.720
YOU REALLY ARE SICK.

35:35.830 --> 35:38.697
I'M NOT THE ONE WHO SITS IN
JAIL WHEN HE DOESN'T HAVE TO.

35:41.970 --> 35:43.858
WELL, AT LEAST YOU
KNOW HOW I FEEL.

35:43.970 --> 35:46.302
AND YOU KNOW
HOW I FEEL.

35:54.320 --> 35:57.312
LOOK, YOU CAN COME VISIT ME
AGAIN IF YOU WANT TO.

36:00.090 --> 36:02.058
NO, I WON'T BE BACK.

36:02.160 --> 36:03.616
OH.

36:04.230 --> 36:05.686
OKAY.

36:05.790 --> 36:07.428
WELL, MAYBE WHEN I GET
PAROLED YOU CAN COME

36:07.530 --> 36:09.521
AND TAKE ME
OUT TO LUNCH.

36:11.200 --> 36:12.929
PROBABLY NOT,
I'M PRETTY BUSY.

36:22.580 --> 36:24.309
I DON'T THINK YOU
CAN BE AN ARTIST

36:24.410 --> 36:26.549
WITHOUT EXPERIENCING
MAJOR SUFFERING.

36:26.650 --> 36:29.244
AND YOU HAVE TO BE SUPER-AWARE
OF THE SUFFERING AROUND YOU.

36:29.350 --> 36:33.286
AND YEAH, I'VE BEEN
INFLUENCED BY DADA AND CUBISM,

36:33.390 --> 36:35.654
BUT I ALSO FEEL LIKE
I'VE ADDED DETACHMENT

36:35.760 --> 36:38.479
AND TENDERNESS,
FOR THE NEW MILLENNIUM.

36:45.900 --> 36:48.095
THIS IS FUCKING FANTASTIC,
EVERYBODY LOVES MY SHIT.

36:48.200 --> 36:50.361
THERE'S SOMEBODY
IN HERE !

36:50.470 --> 36:51.698
HAVE YOU
TALKED TO JIMMY ?

36:51.810 --> 36:54.108
NO, EVERY TIME I SEE HIM,
SOMEBODY GRABS ME

36:54.210 --> 36:55.336
AND WANTS TO TALK
ABOUT THE PICTURES.

36:55.440 --> 36:56.805
YOU SHOULD AT LEAST
GET HIM HIGH.

36:56.910 --> 36:58.138
HERE, YOU DO IT.

36:58.250 --> 36:59.569
HOW DO YOU THINK
IT'S GOING ?

36:59.680 --> 37:01.170
WHAT ?

37:01.280 --> 37:02.110
MY SHOW, WHORE.

37:02.220 --> 37:03.118
OH.

37:03.220 --> 37:04.175
FINE, WHORE.

37:04.290 --> 37:05.541
WELL, WHAT ARE
PEOPLE SAYING ?

37:05.650 --> 37:08.016
I DON'T KNOW, I'M JUST
HANGING OUT WITH MY FRIENDS.

37:08.120 --> 37:10.281
COME ON, I WANNA KNOW
WHAT THEY'RE SAYING.

37:10.390 --> 37:13.450
DON'T DO IT ALL,
SAVE SOME FOR ME.

37:31.850 --> 37:35.172
EVERYONE IS VERY IMPRESSED
WITH CLAIRE'S PICTURES.

37:35.280 --> 37:37.043
YOU MUST BE
VERY PROUD.

37:37.150 --> 37:38.310
I CERTAINLY AM.

37:38.420 --> 37:40.741
I'M PROUD OF ALL
MY CHILDREN.

37:42.460 --> 37:44.212
NATE AND I BACK
TOGETHER AGAIN.

37:44.330 --> 37:46.958
THAT MUST SEEM
VERY SUDDEN.

37:47.060 --> 37:50.496
I MARRIED MY HUSBAND
ALMOST RIGHT AFTER WE MET.

37:50.600 --> 37:53.967
SUDDEN IS SOMETHING
I UNDERSTAND NOW.

37:54.070 --> 37:57.437
IT'S NOT
ALWAYS BEST.

37:57.540 --> 37:59.428
BUT, SOMETIMES IT IS.

38:02.580 --> 38:06.243
BRENDA, I'M GLAD NATE
IS WITH SOMEONE

38:06.350 --> 38:09.740
AND I HOPE THE THREE
OF YOU ARE VERY HAPPY.

38:12.150 --> 38:13.219
THANK YOU.

38:13.320 --> 38:16.380
HE SAYS, YOU'RE
STUDYING PSYCHOLOGY.

38:16.490 --> 38:19.653
YES, I AM GOING TO BE
A COGNITIVE THERAPIST.

38:20.960 --> 38:24.157
WHAT DOES IT MEAN WHEN
A PERSON STARTS TALKING

38:24.260 --> 38:25.818
TO HIMSELF
OUT OF NOWHERE ?

38:37.740 --> 38:39.173
NONE OF YOUR
PIECES HAVE NAMES.

38:39.280 --> 38:42.078
HOW COME ?

38:42.180 --> 38:44.842
I COULDN'T
THINK OF ANY.

38:44.950 --> 38:47.646
COME ON, DON'T BULLSHIT ME,
I'M ACTUALLY INTERESTED.

38:50.120 --> 38:55.490
WELL, I FEEL LIKE WHEN
YOU GIVE SOMETHING A NAME,

38:55.600 --> 38:57.295
PEOPLE TAKE
YOUR WORD FOR IT.

38:57.400 --> 38:59.322
WHICH IS OKAY
FOR SOME THINGS,

38:59.430 --> 39:01.432
BUT NOT THESE.

39:01.540 --> 39:04.338
I DIDN'T WANT TO TELL
ANYBODY WHAT TO SEE.

39:05.740 --> 39:08.504
IT'S LIKE MUSIC
THAT'S CALLED OPUS 15

39:08.610 --> 39:10.339
OR THREE-PART INVENTION
IN "A MINOR".

39:10.440 --> 39:12.169
WHAT'S THAT ABOUT ?

39:18.120 --> 39:20.008
YOU KNOW,
IT'S LIKE LIFE.

39:21.390 --> 39:23.779
IT'S KINDA SCARY.

39:25.490 --> 39:26.559
NO GUIDE.

39:26.660 --> 39:27.922
DON'T KNOW WHERE
I'LL END UP.

39:31.100 --> 39:32.590
YOU KNOW WHAT ?

39:35.500 --> 39:38.037
I HAVE NO FUCKING IDEA
WHAT THESE PICTURES MEAN.

39:40.170 --> 39:41.239
I KNOW.

39:41.340 --> 39:43.399
ISN'T IT GREAT ?

39:48.880 --> 39:49.847
ROGER, YOU DON'T
NEED A BODYGUARD.

39:49.950 --> 39:51.144
YES, I DO.

39:51.250 --> 39:53.639
LOOK, I HAVE ENEMIES.

39:53.750 --> 39:56.287
THERE ARE FUCKERS OUT THERE THAT
WOULD DO ANYTHING TO GET ME.

39:56.390 --> 39:58.085
ANYTHING.

39:58.190 --> 40:00.658
I JUST WANT
TO FEEL SAFE.

40:00.760 --> 40:04.628
AND I WILL PAY YOU
A SHITLOAD OF MONEY.

40:09.400 --> 40:10.731
WELL, I COULDN'T WORK
FOR YOU EXCLUSIVELY,

40:10.840 --> 40:13.365
IT WOULD HAVE TO BE A FREELANCE,
WHEN-I-CAN SITUATION.

40:13.470 --> 40:15.631
I'M SURE WE CAN FIGURE
SOMETHING OUT.

40:15.740 --> 40:17.378
WE'LL DRAW UP
A CONTRACT.

40:17.480 --> 40:19.641
FIRST, I NEED SOMETHING
IN WRITING THAT SAYS

40:19.750 --> 40:20.842
YOU'RE GOING TO DROP
OUR LAWSUIT.

40:20.950 --> 40:21.939
FOREVER.

40:22.050 --> 40:24.610
OH, ALRIGHT.

40:30.020 --> 40:31.658
IS THAT ONE OF THE PEOPLE
YOU'RE AFRAID OF ?

40:31.760 --> 40:33.887
NO.

40:33.990 --> 40:35.696
THAT'S STEVE.

40:35.800 --> 40:38.928
HE STAYS IN THE GUEST
HOUSE SOMETIMES.

40:45.310 --> 40:46.402
WELL ?

40:46.510 --> 40:50.071
I'LL GIVE IT SERIOUS
CONSIDERATION.

41:02.860 --> 41:04.316
I WASN'T SURE
YOU'D BE HERE.

41:04.420 --> 41:06.354
OF COURSE
I'M HERE.

41:06.460 --> 41:08.724
YOU WERE MY STUDENT,
MY ASSISTANT,

41:08.830 --> 41:10.024
YOU THINK THAT MEANS
NOTHING TO ME ?

41:10.130 --> 41:13.588
IT'S MY RESPONSIBILITY
AND MY PLEASURE

41:13.700 --> 41:15.133
TO SUPPORT YOU, CLAIRE.

41:15.240 --> 41:16.264
WOW.

41:16.370 --> 41:17.928
BESIDES,
YOU'RE COMPETITION, NOW.

41:18.040 --> 41:20.964
THOUGH I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE
RUSSELL FIRST IN THIS POSITION.

41:21.070 --> 41:22.901
WELL, YOU
WERE WRONG.

41:23.010 --> 41:23.977
BECAUSE IT'S ME.

41:26.180 --> 41:28.478
AND SO IT
ALL BEGINS.

41:28.580 --> 41:32.209
WITH THE FIRST SUCCESS,
CORRUPTION.

41:32.320 --> 41:35.289
IT'S CORRUPT TO FEEL LIKE
I FINALLY DID SOMETHING RIGHT ?

41:35.390 --> 41:36.982
ACTUALLY,
YES, IT IS.

41:37.090 --> 41:38.978
YOU'LL SEE.

41:39.090 --> 41:41.854
BUT SO WHAT ?

41:41.960 --> 41:43.222
WHO WANTS TO BE
A SAINT, RIGHT ?

41:43.330 --> 41:45.218
NOT ME.

41:45.330 --> 41:46.365
NO, NO ONE DOES

41:46.470 --> 41:49.496
AND THE WORK SUFFERS.

41:51.100 --> 41:53.568
I TOAST YOU WITH
THIS SHITTY WINE.

42:00.980 --> 42:01.742
HELLO THERE.

42:01.850 --> 42:04.341
WELL, YOU LOOK
RECOVERED.

42:04.450 --> 42:07.214
I FEEL FABULOUS.

42:07.320 --> 42:09.185
EVERYONE SHOULD
DROP AN ORGAN,

42:09.290 --> 42:10.757
AFTER THE FIRST SHOCK,

42:10.860 --> 42:12.828
IT'S POSITIVELY
LIBERATING.

42:14.960 --> 42:16.598
SO, IS THIS THE FRUIT
OF NATE'S LOINS ?

42:16.700 --> 42:20.864
MAYA,
THIS IS MARGARET.

42:23.200 --> 42:24.633
LOOK.

42:24.740 --> 42:25.764
DON'T TAKE THIS PERSONALLY,
BUT I DON'T THINK SHE LIKES YOU.

42:25.870 --> 42:26.939
SHE HARDLY KNOWS
YOU'RE HERE.

42:27.040 --> 42:30.430
MARGARET CAN'T HELP
TRYING TO MAKE US

42:30.540 --> 42:31.973
FEEL BAD
ABOUT OURSELVES.

42:32.080 --> 42:34.401
YOU KNOW, BRENDA,

42:34.510 --> 42:36.478
IT'S UNETHICAL TO USE
AN INNOCENT CHILD

42:36.580 --> 42:38.138
TO EXPRESS
YOUR RESENTMENT.

42:42.090 --> 42:43.159
CLAIRE.

42:43.260 --> 42:44.784
DO YOU DO
COMMISSIONS ?

42:44.890 --> 42:46.721
UH, YES.

42:46.830 --> 42:48.991
WELL, I WANT YOU
TO PHOTOGRAPH OLIVIER AND ME

42:49.100 --> 42:52.194
AND DO THAT THING YOU DO, ONLY
MIX ALL OUR PIECES TOGETHER.

42:52.300 --> 42:55.895
THAT WILL BE
A PORTRAIT.

42:58.100 --> 43:01.069
KUDOS, DARLING,
YOU'RE BRILLIANT.

43:07.680 --> 43:08.499
CONGRATULATIONS.

43:08.620 --> 43:11.339
THANK YOU.

43:14.550 --> 43:16.051
EXCUSE ME.

43:25.270 --> 43:26.294
HEY.

43:26.400 --> 43:28.368
CONGRATULATIONS.

43:28.470 --> 43:29.789
THANK YOU,

43:29.900 --> 43:30.832
LOOK, THERE'S SOMEBODY
WHO MAY WANT TO BUY SOMETHING,

43:30.940 --> 43:31.565
I'LL BE BACK
IN ONE MINUTE.

43:31.670 --> 43:33.399
WHAT THE FUCK ?

43:33.510 --> 43:34.408
ARE YOU
BLOWING ME OFF ?

43:34.510 --> 43:35.977
NO.

43:36.080 --> 43:37.479
YOU HAVEN'T SAID SHIT
TO ME SINCE I GOT HERE,

43:37.580 --> 43:39.639
I MEAN,
WHAT THE FUCK ?

43:39.750 --> 43:41.240
I THINK IT'S PRETTY
FUCKING RUDE.

43:41.350 --> 43:42.840
OKAY.

43:42.950 --> 43:45.009
MAYBE YOU DIDN'T
REALIZE THIS,

43:45.120 --> 43:46.781
BUT I'M A LITTLE
FUCKING BUSY RIGHT NOW,

43:46.890 --> 43:47.879
I'M IN THE MIDDLE
OF MY FUCKING SHOW.

43:47.990 --> 43:49.810
MAYBE YOU
DON'T REMEMBER,

43:49.920 --> 43:53.083
BUT I'M THE ONE WHO FUCKING
GOT YOU THIS FUCKING SHOW.

43:55.400 --> 43:56.822
JIMMY.

44:00.800 --> 44:03.394
WELL, FUCK YOU, THEN.

44:03.500 --> 44:05.639
FUCK YOU ALL.

44:36.270 --> 44:37.396
HI, MICHAELA.

44:37.500 --> 44:38.933
HI, UNCLE NATE.

44:43.010 --> 44:44.136
I GAVE THE BOOK
TO DAVID.

44:44.240 --> 44:45.673
THANK YOU.

44:45.780 --> 44:48.169
HE LIKED IT A LOT.

44:54.690 --> 44:56.112
THERE WAS
A PICTURE IN IT.

44:56.220 --> 44:57.812
I KNOW.

44:57.920 --> 45:00.059
WHERE'D THE PICTURE
COME FROM ?

45:03.660 --> 45:05.389
DO YOU KNOW
WHO TOOK IT ?

45:09.040 --> 45:10.439
WHY'D YOU PUT
IT IN THE BOOK ?

45:10.540 --> 45:13.839
YOU SHOULD TALK
TO MY DAD.

45:13.940 --> 45:15.407
HE'S IN THE OFFICE.

45:32.790 --> 45:35.122
GOD, YOU FREAK, WHEN
ARE YOU GONNA LET IT GO ?

45:35.230 --> 45:38.495
WHEN YOU ADMIT, IN PUBLIC,
THAT I AM PART OF YOUR WORK.

45:38.600 --> 45:40.989
YOU'RE NOT !

45:41.100 --> 45:43.660
I CREATED THESE PIECES, THEY
ARE MINE AND PEOPLE LOVE THEM.

45:43.770 --> 45:45.658
I LOVE YOU.

45:45.770 --> 45:47.601
YOU LOVE ?

45:47.710 --> 45:48.904
YOU FUCKED A MAN
AND LIED ABOUT IT.

45:49.010 --> 45:50.329
YOU FUCKED A WOMAN !

45:50.440 --> 45:51.702
NOT WHEN I WAS
WITH YOU !

45:51.810 --> 45:54.404
NO, YOU JUST WENT AND HAD
AN ABORTION WITHOUT ME !

45:54.510 --> 45:57.775
DON'T YOU
DARE GO THERE.

45:57.880 --> 45:59.017
DON'T YOU
FUCKING DARE !

45:59.120 --> 46:00.542
IS THERE
A PROBLEM, GUYS ?

46:00.650 --> 46:04.484
YOU ARE SO
DEEPLY IRRELEVANT.

46:08.800 --> 46:10.199
ARE YOU FUCKING
HIM NOW ?

46:12.100 --> 46:13.692
YOU FUCKED JIMMY
TO GET A GALLERY,

46:13.800 --> 46:16.997
WHAT CAN BILLY CHENOWITH
DO FOR YOU ?

46:17.100 --> 46:18.567
YOU ASSHOLE,
I FUCKING HATE YOU.

46:18.670 --> 46:19.762
THIS HAS
TO STOP NOW.

46:19.870 --> 46:21.098
IT'S TIME
TO LEAVE.

46:21.210 --> 46:22.507
JUST LEAVE.

46:22.610 --> 46:24.498
THIS NEEDS TO STOP.

46:24.610 --> 46:26.475
OUT.

46:38.930 --> 46:40.420
ARE YOU ALRIGHT ?

46:43.460 --> 46:45.064
TAKE ME HOME.

46:54.810 --> 46:56.368
ARE YOU CRAZY ?

46:56.480 --> 46:58.675
IF I WAS YOU, FELLA,
I'D MOVE ON DOWN THE ROAD

46:58.780 --> 47:00.179
BEFORE BARB FINDS
OUT YOU'RE HERE.

47:00.280 --> 47:01.747
HOYT, I'LL ASK YOU
ONE MORE TIME

47:01.850 --> 47:03.340
AND THEN I'M
CALLING THE POLICE.

47:03.450 --> 47:04.986
WHOA, WHOA.

47:05.090 --> 47:06.614
DID YOU TAKE
THAT PICTURE ?

47:06.720 --> 47:09.780
SHE'S A KIMMEL,

47:09.890 --> 47:13.018
WE TEND TO POINT
CAMERAS AT EACH OTHER.

47:13.130 --> 47:17.453
SOMEBODY OBVIOUSLY TOOK IT,
MAYBE IT WAS ME.

47:17.560 --> 47:20.290
NO, I REMEMBER THIS,
THIS WAS A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO.

47:20.400 --> 47:22.265
WE HAD A PICNIC.

47:24.470 --> 47:26.006
YOU'RE A FUCKING LIAR.

47:27.840 --> 47:29.307
YOU WERE WITH THERE WITH LISA
ON THE BEACH THE DAY SHE DIED.

47:29.410 --> 47:30.399
NO.

47:30.510 --> 47:31.977
YES, YOU WERE.

47:32.080 --> 47:34.503
AND THIS PROVES IT.

47:37.720 --> 47:39.039
YOU SONOFABITCH,
WHAT DID YOU DO TO HER ?

47:39.150 --> 47:42.051
NOTHING, GOD, NOTHING !

47:44.420 --> 47:47.355
THIS WAS A PLACE
THAT WE USED TO GO.

47:47.460 --> 47:49.621
I'D DRIVE SOUTH
AND I'D MEET HER THERE.

47:49.730 --> 47:51.357
ALONE ?

47:51.460 --> 47:53.599
MAYBE, A FEW TIMES.

47:53.700 --> 47:55.031
YEAH.

47:55.900 --> 47:57.538
WHY ?

48:04.380 --> 48:06.473
WE HAD A THING.

48:06.580 --> 48:08.047
IT WAS ON AND OFF...

48:09.450 --> 48:10.815
BUT IT WAS INTENSE.

48:10.920 --> 48:12.285
YOU KNOW LISA...

48:13.390 --> 48:15.210
SHE WAS INTENSE.

48:17.890 --> 48:19.448
WHEN WAS THIS ?

48:20.530 --> 48:21.588
WHEN WE
WERE MARRIED ?

48:21.690 --> 48:23.021
BEFORE.

48:25.770 --> 48:27.419
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU.

48:30.170 --> 48:32.661
SHE TOLD ME WHAT IT
WAS LIKE TO BE YOUR WIFE.

48:34.810 --> 48:36.004
WHAT THE FUCK
IS WRONG WITH YOU ?

48:36.110 --> 48:37.668
WHY DID YOU PUT HER
THROUGH ALL THAT ?

48:37.780 --> 48:39.145
1--

48:39.250 --> 48:41.571
YOU THINK SHE JUST SPENT HER
WHOLE LIFE WAITING FOR YOU ?

48:42.580 --> 48:44.275
PEOPLE LOVED LISA.

48:46.120 --> 48:48.418
AND SHE LOVED US BACK.

48:50.190 --> 48:52.249
YOU KNOW, SHE MIGHT HAVE
KILLED HERSELF BECAUSE OF YOU.

48:52.360 --> 48:55.227
OH YEAH, DID YOU EVER
THINK ABOUT THAT ?

49:00.230 --> 49:02.266
LISTEN, LET'S TAKE
A WALK, OKAY ?

49:02.370 --> 49:03.689
THIS IS A BIG
MISUNDERSTANDING.

49:03.800 --> 49:04.869
NO, NO, NO !

49:04.970 --> 49:06.699
LISA WOULD NEVER
KILL HERSELF !

49:07.670 --> 49:09.103
I KNOW THAT.

49:09.210 --> 49:11.974
SHE MIGHT LEAVE ME,
BUT SHE WOULD NEVER LEAVE MAYA.

49:14.680 --> 49:18.116
SO YOU TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED
ON THAT BEACH RIGHT NOW.

49:18.220 --> 49:20.040
RIGHT THE FUCK NOW !

49:29.100 --> 49:31.751
I WANTED SOME TIME
BY OURSELVES.

49:31.860 --> 49:33.669
LISA SAID SHE
WASN'T INTO IT.

49:33.770 --> 49:35.988
YOU KNOW, CLEAN SLATE,
NEVER AGAIN.

49:36.100 --> 49:38.091
OKAY, FINE.

49:40.270 --> 49:42.135
I COULDN'T LET
HER TELL BARB.

49:49.050 --> 49:51.939
I DID NOT GET
ANGRY WITH HER.

49:52.050 --> 49:54.314
I PLAYED THE GUITAR,
I SANG HER A SONG.

49:55.690 --> 49:57.089
I SANG HER A SONG...

49:59.690 --> 50:01.089
AND WE...

50:05.600 --> 50:07.158
WENT OUR
SEPARATE WAYS.

50:08.900 --> 50:10.492
(crying )

50:20.380 --> 50:20.903
( gunshot)

50:21.010 --> 50:22.511
AAHH !

52:06.150 --> 52:10.519
( police radio chatter)

52:59.770 --> 53:01.533
GEORGE ?

53:11.980 --> 53:13.538
GEORGE ?

53:17.620 --> 53:19.850
HAVE YOU BEEN HERE
ALL NIGHT ?

53:19.960 --> 53:23.157
I HAD TO PUT THINGS IN ORDER
AND I GUESS I FELL ASLEEP.

53:23.260 --> 53:25.694
DIDN'T MEAN
TO WORRY YOU.

53:26.330 --> 53:27.866
NO HARM DONE.

53:29.130 --> 53:31.997
COME ON, LET'S GO
BACK TO THE HOUSE.

53:32.100 --> 53:33.738
I CAN'T DO THAT.

53:33.840 --> 53:37.936
YES, YOU CAN, DEAR,
IT'S WHERE WE LIVE.

53:38.040 --> 53:40.440
NO, RUTH.

53:40.550 --> 53:44.418
THIS IS WHERE
I LIVE NOW.

55:05.130 --> 55:06.961
LET'S GET MARRIED
AND HAVE A BABY.

55:08.770 --> 55:09.930
WILL YOU ?

55:10.040 --> 55:11.962
YES.

55:19.240 --> 55:22.038
(thunder)

55:59.990 --> 56:01.218
OH, GOOD.

56:01.320 --> 56:02.719
MY BOUGAINVILLEA
NEEDS THIS.

56:04.690 --> 56:06.453
YOU WERE BRAVE
TO FACE HIM.

56:08.790 --> 56:09.825
NOT REALLY.

56:09.930 --> 56:10.828
THERE WAS A GUARD.

56:10.930 --> 56:11.828
DOESN'T MATTER.

56:11.930 --> 56:14.797
I'M PROUD OF YOU.

56:17.640 --> 56:19.198
I THOUGHT IT WOULD
SET ME FREE.

56:19.300 --> 56:21.268
BUT IT DIDN'T
CHANGE ANYTHING,

56:21.370 --> 56:23.270
EXCEPT NOW I KNOW
HE REALLY IS INSANE.

56:23.380 --> 56:25.177
YOU'RE MISSING
THE POINT.

56:25.280 --> 56:27.942
THERE IS NO POINT.

56:28.050 --> 56:29.005
THAT'S THE POINT.

56:29.110 --> 56:31.317
ISN'T IT ?

56:31.420 --> 56:33.115
OH, DON'T GIVE ME THAT PHONY
EXISTENTIAL BULLSHIT.

56:33.220 --> 56:34.585
I EXPECT BETTER
FROM YOU.

56:34.690 --> 56:37.659
THE POINT'S RIGHT
IN FRONT OF YOUR FACE.

56:39.630 --> 56:42.326
WELL, I'M SORRY,
BUT I DON'T SEE IT.

56:42.430 --> 56:44.159
YOU'RE NOT EVEN
GRATEFUL, ARE YOU ?

56:45.160 --> 56:46.422
GRATEFUL ?

56:46.530 --> 56:48.794
FOR THE WORST FUCKING
EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE ?

56:48.900 --> 56:51.198
YOU HANG ONTO YOUR PAIN
LIKE IT MEANS SOMETHING,

56:51.300 --> 56:52.608
LIKE IT'S WORTH
SOMETHING.

56:52.710 --> 56:53.961
WELL, LET ME TELL YOU,
IT'S NOT WORTH SHIT.

56:54.070 --> 56:55.332
LET IT GO.

56:55.440 --> 56:59.479
INFINITE POSSIBILITIES
AND ALL HE CAN DO IS WHINE.

57:01.480 --> 57:02.469
WELL, WHAT AM
I SUPPOSED TO DO ?

57:02.580 --> 57:03.512
WHAT DO YOU THINK ?

57:03.620 --> 57:04.769
YOU CAN DO ANYTHING,

57:04.880 --> 57:08.316
YOU LUCKY BASTARD,
YOU'RE ALIVE.

57:08.420 --> 57:10.752
WHAT'S A LITTLE PAIN
COMPARED TO THAT ?

57:16.600 --> 57:18.795
IT CAN'T BE
SO SIMPLE.

57:25.510 --> 57:27.068
WHAT IF IT IS ?
