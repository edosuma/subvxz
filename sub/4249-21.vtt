11:33.442 --> 11:36.237
- ALFIE, NO, DON'T--
DON'T MOVE, DON'T MOVE!

11:40.616 --> 11:41.784
OKAY.

11:41.867 --> 11:42.410
I'VE GOT YOU.

11:42.493 --> 11:44.703
- I'M OKAY.

11:44.787 --> 11:47.540
- I'M SO SORRY, ALFIE.

11:47.623 --> 11:48.874
- COME ON, LET'S GET YOU
OUT OF HERE.

11:48.958 --> 11:50.334
COME ON.
NICE AND SLOW.

11:50.418 --> 11:51.669
NICE AND SLOW.

12:07.393 --> 12:09.645
- WHAT YOU DOING?

12:09.728 --> 12:10.771
- NOTES.

12:10.855 --> 12:13.691
I'M FOLLOWING A HOT LEAD
FOR MY...

12:13.774 --> 12:15.151
LIGHT PROFILE ON VERA.

12:15.234 --> 12:17.736
- WHAT IS IT?

12:17.820 --> 12:20.948
SOME KIND OF LIFETIME
ACHEIVEMENT IN BAKING?

12:21.031 --> 12:23.868
- YEAH, SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

12:26.454 --> 12:29.623
- NO, THANK YOU, PATRICIA.

12:29.707 --> 12:32.251
- IS THAT ALL YOU'VE GOT
IN YOUR BAD GIRL BAG?

12:32.334 --> 12:34.170
FAIL.
EPIC FAIL.

12:34.253 --> 12:36.672
- THERE'S ONLY ONE
EPIC FAIL AROUND HERE.

12:36.755 --> 12:38.424
AND I'M LOOKING AT HIM.

12:38.507 --> 12:39.800
- LET ME SHOW YOU
HOW IT'S DONE, HMM?

12:50.686 --> 12:52.521
- I CAN TOTALLY TOP THAT.

12:52.605 --> 12:55.232
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

12:57.234 --> 12:57.985
- OH, PATRICIA, NO.

13:01.280 --> 13:03.491
- OOPS.

13:03.574 --> 13:04.533
- OH.

13:04.617 --> 13:06.368
A LITTLE MORE CARE, GIRLS.

13:06.452 --> 13:07.828
- SORRY.
- OH, I'LL HELP.

13:30.476 --> 13:31.477
- YUM-YUM.

13:31.560 --> 13:33.062
HO!

13:33.145 --> 13:34.563
PATRICIA, WAS THAT YOU?

13:34.647 --> 13:35.689
- GUILTY.

13:35.773 --> 13:37.066
- WELL, YOU'RE IN REAL TROUBLE.

13:37.149 --> 13:39.109
YOU SEE ME AFTER CLASS.

13:44.240 --> 13:45.324
[screaming]

13:45.407 --> 13:46.242
[laughter]

13:46.325 --> 13:48.369
PATRICIA!

13:48.452 --> 13:51.747
- UH, THAT WAS ME.

13:51.830 --> 13:54.250
- WELL, DON'T LET ME CATCH YOU

13:54.333 --> 13:57.211
MISUSING SCHOOL APPARATUS
AGAIN, IS THAT CLEAR?

13:57.294 --> 13:58.420
- YEAH.

13:58.504 --> 14:00.172
- AND, AS FOR YOU,
MISS WILLIAMSON,

14:00.256 --> 14:01.298
I'M GETTING RATHER TIRED

14:01.382 --> 14:03.509
OF YOU LEADING
NEW STUDENTS ASTRAY.

14:03.592 --> 14:06.262
YOU WILL COPY DOWN
THAT PERIODIC TABLE

14:06.345 --> 14:08.764
100 TIMES BEFORE TOMORROW.

14:08.847 --> 14:11.892
PERHAPS YOU WILL LEARN
SOME RESPECT FOR THE SCIENCES.

14:23.028 --> 14:24.780
- DUDE!
HERE IT IS!

14:24.863 --> 14:26.657
THE SCHOOL SPORTING RECORD.

14:31.620 --> 14:33.747
- FROBISHER SHIELD,
FROBISHER SHIELD!

14:33.831 --> 14:36.166
THE JUBILANT CHAMPIONS
HOLDING THE WINNER'S SHIELD,

14:36.250 --> 14:36.959
WHICH WAS DONATED
TO THE SCHOOL

14:37.042 --> 14:38.627
BY SARAH FROBISHER-SMYTHE

14:38.711 --> 14:40.504
IN HONOR OF HER FATHER ROBERT,

14:40.588 --> 14:44.300
A KEEN PING-PONG ENTHUSIAST.

14:44.383 --> 14:47.011
- SO...CHARMING AND SCAMMING
ARE OUT, THEN.

14:47.094 --> 14:48.887
YOU MIGHT HAVE TO WIN IT BACK
FAIR AND SQUARE.

14:50.431 --> 14:52.308
- FAIR AND SQUARE?

14:52.391 --> 14:52.933
THAT'S A THING, RIGHT?

14:53.017 --> 14:54.685
- IT'S A THING.

14:56.353 --> 14:57.438
- THAT'S FUNNY.

14:57.521 --> 14:59.148
I'VE NEVER REALLY GOT IT.

15:05.070 --> 15:05.946
- MR. SWEET!
MR. SWEET!

15:06.030 --> 15:08.991
- AH, LEWIS AND CLARKE.
EXCELLENT.

15:09.074 --> 15:10.117
AND WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU?

15:10.200 --> 15:12.661
- IT'S ABOUT
THE FROBISHER SHIELD.

15:12.745 --> 15:13.871
I WANT TO WIN IT BACK.

15:13.954 --> 15:17.166
- THE FROBISHER SHIELD
ISN'T A JOKE.

15:17.249 --> 15:19.460
IF WE COULD ACTUALLY
WIN IT BACK, WHY, THEN,

15:19.543 --> 15:22.046
THE SCHOOL COULD
BE TRULY GREAT ONCE MORE,

15:22.129 --> 15:25.633
AND GREATNESS
IS NO LAUGHING MATTER.

15:25.716 --> 15:28.677
- CHECK OUT HIS SERIOUS FACE,
MR. SWEET.

15:28.761 --> 15:29.386
HUH?
SEE?

15:29.470 --> 15:31.889
IT'S SERIOUS.

15:31.972 --> 15:33.849
SERIOUSLY.

15:33.932 --> 15:35.351
- IF YOU BOTH REALLY MEAN THIS,

15:35.434 --> 15:37.144
THEN I'LL MAKE ARRANGEMENTS.

15:37.227 --> 15:37.978
BUT ONCE YOU BEGIN ON THIS,

15:38.062 --> 15:40.564
THE HOPES OF THE ENTIRE SCHOOL

15:40.648 --> 15:43.525
WILL BE RIDING ON THIS MATCH.

15:43.609 --> 15:45.069
- NO PRESSURE, THEN.

15:48.322 --> 15:50.824
- AND YOU'LL BE NEEDING
ONE OF THESE, ALFIE.

15:50.908 --> 15:54.370
THE FROBISHER SHIELD
IS FOR PING-PONG DOUBLES.

15:56.872 --> 15:58.415
- JEROME AND ALFIE,

15:58.499 --> 16:01.210
PING-PONG PARTNERS IN CRIME.

16:01.293 --> 16:04.880
WHO ELSE AM I GONNA TRUST
WITH SOMETHING LIKE THIS?

16:20.979 --> 16:23.899
- HEY.
- HEY.

16:23.982 --> 16:27.027
SO, UH...WHAT DID YOU WANT
TO MEET ME FOR?

16:27.111 --> 16:28.904
- UM, TO SPEAK WITH JASPER
ABOUT THE DOCUMENTARY.

16:28.987 --> 16:30.906
I THOUGHT YOU SHOULD BE HERE.

16:30.989 --> 16:32.825
WHY?
WHAT DID YOU THINK IT WAS?

16:32.908 --> 16:34.493
- [laughs]
NOTHING.

16:34.576 --> 16:36.829
UM, NOTHING.

16:36.912 --> 16:38.080
I JUST...

16:38.163 --> 16:39.081
THOUGHT MAYBE, UH...

16:39.164 --> 16:43.419
- NINA, THERE IS NO ME AND JOY.

16:43.502 --> 16:46.213
HONEST.
IT WAS JUST A MOVIE.

16:46.296 --> 16:48.674
IS THAT WHAT LAST NIGHT
WAS ABOUT?

16:48.757 --> 16:51.176
- LOOK,
LAST NIGHT WAS A MISTAKE.

16:51.260 --> 16:52.720
I WON'T BE MAKING IT AGAIN.

16:52.803 --> 16:55.264
[door opens]

16:55.347 --> 16:59.101
- SO, FABIAN, HOW DID YOU ENJOY
<i>SECRETS OF ANCIENT EGYPT?</i>

16:59.184 --> 17:00.519
THRILLING, WASN'T IT?

17:00.602 --> 17:02.771
- WELL, THAT WAS WHAT I WANTED
TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT.

17:02.855 --> 17:04.982
WE NEED TO KNOW MORE ABOUT THE
EGYPTIAN TYRANT IT MENTIONED.

17:05.065 --> 17:08.068
- AH, YES.
FASCINATING SUBJECT, EH?

17:08.152 --> 17:12.781
NOW, I DO HAVE SOMETHING
SOMEWHERE ABOUT HER.

17:12.865 --> 17:14.950
NOW, WHERE WOULD I HAVE
FILED IT?

17:15.032 --> 17:17.953
[creepy whispering]
CHOSEN ONE...

17:19.496 --> 17:21.330
- A-HA, HERE WE ARE, YES.

17:21.415 --> 17:22.708
[creepy whispering]
CHOSEN ONE...

17:22.790 --> 17:24.792
- THE FORGOTTEN RULER:

17:24.877 --> 17:26.878
A TERRIBLE, TYRRANICAL QUEEN.

17:26.962 --> 17:29.631
ARCHAEOLOGISTS FOUND
AN EMPTY TOMB IN 1913.

17:29.715 --> 17:32.885
APART FROM THE CROWN,

17:32.968 --> 17:33.761
IT WAS COMPLETELY EMPTY.

17:33.844 --> 17:36.638
NO BODY, NOTHING.

17:36.722 --> 17:40.225
[creepy whispering]
CHOSEN ONE...

17:40.309 --> 17:41.393
- THERE'S NO NAME IN THE BOOK?

17:41.477 --> 17:42.144
- NO.

17:42.227 --> 17:44.188
ALTHOUGH, I WAS TOLD ONCE

17:44.271 --> 17:48.150
I THINK SEVERAL YEARS AGO
IN CAIRO.

17:48.233 --> 17:50.861
[creepy whispering]
CHOSEN ONE...

17:50.944 --> 17:52.237
- OUR GUIDE WHISPERED A NAME,

17:52.321 --> 17:54.948
SOMETHING HIS GRANDMOTHER
HAD TOLD HIM

17:55.032 --> 17:57.284
WHEN HE WAS A CHILD,
TO SCARE HIM.

17:57.367 --> 17:58.660
WHAT WAS IT, NOW?

17:58.744 --> 18:00.412
YOU KNOW, FOR THE LIFE OF ME,
I CAN'T REMEMBER.

18:00.496 --> 18:03.624
IT WAS SO LONG AGO.

18:03.707 --> 18:04.792
woman: FIND IT.

18:04.875 --> 18:06.168
FIND IT BEFORE ANYONE ELSE.

18:08.754 --> 18:10.088
OR FORFEIT YOUR LIFE.

18:12.424 --> 18:17.805
[creepy whispering]
SANKARA, SANKARA, SANKARA.

18:18.680 --> 18:19.181
- SANKARA.

18:21.725 --> 18:22.810
- YES!

18:22.893 --> 18:24.520
HOW DID YOU KNOW?

18:36.824 --> 18:38.200
- WHERE DID YOU FIND IT?

18:38.283 --> 18:40.202
- IN THE UPSTAIRS HALLWAY.

18:40.285 --> 18:43.163
ONE OF THOSE BRATS
MUST HAVE DROPPED IT.

18:43.247 --> 18:45.290
- AND DOES IT CONTAIN
THE RECIPE FOR THE ELIXIR.

18:45.374 --> 18:47.292
- WELL, I'M NOT SURE.

18:47.376 --> 18:50.629
I'VE ONLY BEEN ABLE
TO DECIPHER HALF OF IT.

18:50.712 --> 18:54.132
THE REST OF THE HIEROGLYPHICS
ARE A MYSTERY.

18:54.216 --> 18:55.634
- "AT THE PORTAL OF THE MIND,

18:55.717 --> 18:58.345
THE WEEPING PARAGON
WILL FIND..."

19:01.431 --> 19:02.558
WILL FIND WHAT?

19:02.641 --> 19:03.725
- WELL...

19:03.809 --> 19:05.769
- SEEMS LIKE A LOAD
OF MUMBO-JUMBO TO ME.

19:05.853 --> 19:08.188
- OH, NO, NO, NO, NO.

19:08.272 --> 19:12.568
IT MEANS THIS MASK
IS MUCH MORE POWERFUL

19:12.651 --> 19:13.193
THAN I THOUGHT.

19:26.373 --> 19:27.916
- WE HAVE A PROBLEM.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.168
VICTOR'S FOUND
THE FINAL CHAPTER.

19:32.880 --> 19:35.132
- THREE HOURS.

19:35.215 --> 19:37.426
THREE HOURS
OF EGYPTIAN HISTORY.

19:39.887 --> 19:41.263
HELLO, MARA...

19:41.346 --> 19:43.265
WHERE'S MY POST-DATE THERAPY?

19:43.348 --> 19:44.892
- OH, SORRY, JOY.

19:44.975 --> 19:46.101
FIRST LESSON OF JOURNALISM:

19:46.184 --> 19:50.606
QUESTION EVERYTHING,
ASSUME NOTHING.

19:52.441 --> 19:56.612
- "COOK SERVES UP
PRESTIGIOUS AWARD."

19:56.695 --> 19:58.238
AND THIS IS RELEVANT HOW?

19:58.322 --> 20:00.115
- THIS ARTICLE IS FROM THE YEAR

20:00.198 --> 20:02.826
VERA CLAIMS TO HAVE WORKED
AT BEACON GROVE BOYS SCHOOL,

20:02.910 --> 20:04.703
AS HEAD COOK.

20:04.786 --> 20:07.289
- OH.

20:07.372 --> 20:09.666
WELL, EITHER SHE WAS
A SHORT GUY IN A WHITE SHIRT

20:09.750 --> 20:11.293
OR SHE'S NOT IN THAT PHOTO.

20:11.376 --> 20:12.794
- WHICH MEANS SHE'S LYING.

20:12.878 --> 20:16.298
- OR SHE MADE A MISTAKE.

20:16.381 --> 20:17.925
AREN'T YOU TAKING THIS
A BIT TOO SERIOUSLY

20:18.008 --> 20:20.135
FOR A FLUFF PIECE?

20:20.218 --> 20:23.972
- QUESTIONG EVERYTHING,
ASSUME NOTHING, JOY.

20:24.056 --> 20:25.098
- HMM.

20:28.602 --> 20:32.648
- IT'S 10:00.

20:32.731 --> 20:36.068
YOU HAVE FIVE MINUTES PRECISELY,

20:36.151 --> 20:43.283
AND THEN I WANT TO HEAR
A PIN DROP.

20:46.912 --> 20:49.456
- "LAY HER DAUGHTERS
IN THEIR HOME."

21:11.395 --> 21:13.939
- WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN THEY'RE ALL DONE?

21:16.608 --> 21:18.318
- LET'S JUST ALL BE READY.

21:25.993 --> 21:29.079
[high-pitched moaning]

21:35.627 --> 21:37.045
[gears clicking]

21:41.133 --> 21:42.300
- YOU DID IT!

21:42.384 --> 21:43.343
WAY TO GO!

21:48.473 --> 21:50.517
- [gasps]

21:50.600 --> 21:51.768
- NO, NINA, DON'T!

21:53.812 --> 21:55.731
- THIS MIGHT BE
THE ONLY CHANCE I GET.

21:55.814 --> 21:57.816
- NO!
NO!

21:57.899 --> 21:58.775
NINA!

21:58.859 --> 22:00.152
both: NO!

22:02.696 --> 22:03.989
- NINA!
