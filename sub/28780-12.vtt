00:49.849 --> 00:52.185
The details you put in
make it look wrong.

00:52.252 --> 00:54.120

- It's a pretty clunky design.

00:54.187 --> 00:55.588

00:57.157 --> 00:58.658

a very flat,
non-detailed image.

01:01.060 --> 01:02.562
My decision's for Janelle.

06:32.859 --> 06:34.127

06:34.193 --> 06:35.895

06:35.962 --> 06:38.898
like, a hammer and a wrench
behind a horseshoe

06:38.965 --> 06:40.867

06:40.933 --> 06:42.735

you in my direction,

06:42.802 --> 06:44.837

won for this tattoo, so--

06:44.904 --> 06:46.572
- Are you the next Ink Master?

06:46.639 --> 06:47.707
- I have faith in myself,

06:47.774 --> 06:48.875
{\an1}so I don't have faith
in everybody else.

06:48.941 --> 06:50.476

{\an3}- Yeah,
intergalactic alien girl.

06:52.879 --> 06:54.580

kind of similar.

06:54.647 --> 06:56.082
{\an1}- As impressive

06:56.149 --> 06:57.550
I've seen it a bunch of times.

06:57.617 --> 06:58.885

something else, trust me.

07:14.233 --> 07:16.369

07:16.435 --> 07:18.004
{\an1}I love doing black and gray,
obviously, as you see.

07:18.070 --> 07:20.239
{\an1}There's another guy here
that also does black and gray,

07:20.306 --> 07:21.574
{\an1}but I think we both kind of do
the same thing.

07:21.641 --> 07:22.909
{\an1}So, I think that would
just be up to you,

07:22.975 --> 07:24.177
{\an1}who you feel
more comfortable with.

07:24.243 --> 07:25.611

24:05.210 --> 24:07.646
the judges will determine
whether or not you are safe

24:07.712 --> 24:08.747
{\an8}from elimination.

24:14.319 --> 24:16.054
{\an8}- Let's see how you did.

24:16.121 --> 24:17.823
Dani.

24:17.889 --> 24:19.291
<i>[dramatic music]</i>

24:19.357 --> 24:20.892
Let's take a look
at your day one tattoo.

24:20.959 --> 24:22.561
- This tattoo is very nice.

24:22.627 --> 24:24.196
All the little circles
that you have

24:24.262 --> 24:26.631
around the jewel
show a lot of accuracy,

24:26.698 --> 24:29.467
and the subtle little shading
behind the clear areas

24:29.534 --> 24:30.902
push the tattoo forward.

24:30.969 --> 24:33.038
I can see why a canvas
would pick you,

24:33.104 --> 24:34.806
because it did show
a lot of accuracy.

24:34.873 --> 24:36.107
- Thank you very much.

24:36.174 --> 24:37.509
- Let's take a look
at your second tattoo.

24:37.576 --> 24:39.444
- This tattoo has
an unfinished feel to it.

24:39.511 --> 24:41.513
- The reason this is happening
is tonal.

24:41.580 --> 24:45.250
I need black to separate
all that nice work in the face

24:45.317 --> 24:47.786
from this big open space
that leaves my partner

24:47.853 --> 24:48.987
thinking that you're not done.

24:49.054 --> 24:50.789
- All right, guys,
time to determine,

24:50.856 --> 24:52.757
is Dani safe from elimination?

24:52.824 --> 24:54.125
- This late in the competition,

24:54.192 --> 24:55.861
this is not enough
to get safety.

24:55.927 --> 24:57.395
- You gotta go back
to the drawing board

24:57.462 --> 24:58.563
and show us one more time.

24:58.630 --> 25:01.199
- Dani, you are not safe
from elimination.

25:03.535 --> 25:05.036
Holli.

25:05.103 --> 25:06.538
<i>[dramatic music]</i>

25:06.605 --> 25:08.607
Let's take a look
at your day one tattoo.

25:08.673 --> 25:10.442
- Architecture is not something
you want to try to pull

25:10.508 --> 25:11.977
in this competition.

25:12.043 --> 25:14.246
- The shape of the door,
the shape of the windows,

25:14.312 --> 25:16.615
those need to be very stiff
and very rigid

25:16.681 --> 25:19.284
and very parallel,
and you lose it.

25:19.351 --> 25:22.153
- Based on this tattoo,
another canvas chose you.

25:22.220 --> 25:24.289
- This one's got some nice
effects to it.

25:24.356 --> 25:27.092
You show some nice application
and some smooth color fades,

25:27.158 --> 25:28.326
and a stronger outline.

25:28.393 --> 25:29.895
- The lizard itself,
I like the details

25:29.961 --> 25:31.463
that you put in the face.

25:31.529 --> 25:32.998
- I like it a lot better than
the house, that's for sure.

25:33.064 --> 25:34.099
- Yeah, me too.

25:34.165 --> 25:35.867
- Is Holli safe
from elimination?

25:35.934 --> 25:38.770
- That many outline problems,
I have to say no.

25:38.837 --> 25:41.673
- Holli, you are not safe
from elimination.

25:45.477 --> 25:47.746
- Jake.

25:47.812 --> 25:50.081
Let's get into
your day one tattoo.

25:50.148 --> 25:51.516
- Tonal overall.

25:51.583 --> 25:53.151
The shading on the back side
of the tentacle

25:53.218 --> 25:54.519
looks like the shading
in the skull,

25:54.586 --> 25:55.921
looks like the shading
in the boat.

25:55.987 --> 25:57.555
- This was a lot of shit
to try to fit in one thing.

25:57.622 --> 25:59.457
- You gotta accentuate
some things, man.

25:59.524 --> 26:01.426
You gotta push and pull
dark and light

26:01.493 --> 26:02.794
to separate things.

26:02.861 --> 26:04.396
- Let's take a look
at your day two tattoo.

26:04.462 --> 26:06.665
- From the arm up, he's hairy.

26:06.731 --> 26:08.133
From the arm down,
you don't have

26:08.199 --> 26:09.634
a single fur texture.

26:09.701 --> 26:11.436
- I just tried to change it up
so it didn't look like,

26:11.503 --> 26:13.605
which part's the leg,
which part's the stick?

26:13.672 --> 26:14.839
Like, that was all intentional.

26:14.906 --> 26:16.474
- Right, but you want
to keep it furry.

26:16.541 --> 26:18.710
The knees and the wrinkles,
the way that you have it

26:18.777 --> 26:20.345
in the legs,
they look like skin.

26:20.412 --> 26:22.914
- All right, judges,
time to determine,

26:22.981 --> 26:24.382
is Jake safe?

26:24.449 --> 26:25.917
- There is some
shortcomings overall.

26:25.984 --> 26:28.954
Doing decent tattoos is not
gonna win this competition.

26:29.020 --> 26:30.121
If you're gonna be safe,

26:30.188 --> 26:31.957
you gotta really push
the limits.

26:32.023 --> 26:34.292
- I'm on board with Oliver.

26:34.359 --> 26:37.295
- Jake, you are not safe
from elimination.

26:41.366 --> 26:42.934
{\an8}- Jason.

26:43.001 --> 26:44.336
<i>[dramatic music]</i>

26:44.402 --> 26:46.071
Let's take a look
at your day one tattoo.

26:46.137 --> 26:47.572
What I really love is the way

26:47.639 --> 26:49.941
that this purple is shaded
in the suit,

26:50.008 --> 26:52.043
and how you're showing
the musculature

26:52.110 --> 26:54.079
with so much open skin.

26:54.145 --> 26:55.413
- The color play is super cool.

26:55.480 --> 26:57.215
The background is also
very cool.

26:57.282 --> 26:58.516
I like it a lot.

26:58.583 --> 27:00.285
- Clearly, this tattoo spoke
to the canvas,

27:00.352 --> 27:02.053
because you were selected
right off the bat.

27:02.120 --> 27:03.421
- Your design on this
is killer,

27:03.488 --> 27:04.889
and your outline
on this is killer.

27:04.956 --> 27:06.157
- I love the color choices.

27:06.224 --> 27:07.592
I love the pink
against the green,

27:07.659 --> 27:09.961
the blue in the umbrella
is done really well.

27:10.028 --> 27:11.162
It came out super sweet.

27:11.229 --> 27:12.664
- Awesome, thank you.

27:12.731 --> 27:15.433
- Time to determine if Jason
is safe from elimination.

27:15.500 --> 27:17.635
- It's two clean tattoos,
and I say yes.

27:17.702 --> 27:19.037
- I agree.
- Awesome.

27:19.104 --> 27:21.406
- Jason, you are safe
from elimination.

27:21.473 --> 27:24.743
Please have a seat.
- Thank you.

27:24.809 --> 27:25.977

27:26.044 --> 27:27.078
- [laughs]

27:28.546 --> 27:30.482

any comments for the artists

27:30.548 --> 27:31.916
that didn't tattoo today?

27:31.983 --> 27:34.085
- Cam, I wasn't really
super surprised

27:34.152 --> 27:36.321
that you didn't get picked,
because from a distance,

27:36.388 --> 27:37.789
it's hard to see
what's going on.

27:37.856 --> 27:40.592

Another horse, buddy.

38:00.277 --> 38:03.214

You still do
a traditional tattoo,

39:18.756 --> 39:20.024

39:20.091 --> 39:21.425

39:21.492 --> 39:22.960

39:23.027 --> 39:24.662

black and gray again.

I mean, it's gray and gray,
there's no black in it.

- I mean, if you want to go
on which tattoos

39:31.502 --> 39:33.504
were done cleaner
but didn't hit the challenge,

39:33.571 --> 39:34.872
because I won't lie
to you, Cam, like,

39:34.939 --> 39:36.674
they're very similar styles.

39:36.741 --> 39:38.576
But then with Holli's,
they just weren't as clean.

39:38.642 --> 39:41.545
- As far as application,
Holli's black-and-gray tattoo,

39:41.612 --> 39:44.348
ignore the redness,
just look at the solid black

39:44.415 --> 39:45.549
and see the roughness.

39:45.616 --> 39:48.018
- In this tattoo,
you crave the softness

39:48.085 --> 39:49.086
of Cam's light shading.

39:49.153 --> 39:50.321
- Yeah.

39:50.387 --> 39:51.722

to a body of work,
