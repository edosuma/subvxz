00:02.160 --> 00:04.280
TARA NARRATING: Previously
on "Dance Academy."

00:04.320 --> 00:05.400
-Amazeballs.

00:05.440 --> 00:06.559
Will you show me so I
can do it better?

00:10.080 --> 00:11.439
-Oh!

00:11.480 --> 00:14.759
-I'm stuck here, but I don't
care about being the best.

00:14.800 --> 00:16.559
-Everyone cares about
being the best.

00:16.600 --> 00:18.239
GRACE (OFFSCREEN):
I'm not everyone.

00:18.280 --> 00:21.480
-I think I like you.

00:21.519 --> 00:23.440
I know I like you.

00:23.480 --> 00:24.399
It was a blip.

00:24.440 --> 00:26.320
Just forget it ever happened.

00:26.359 --> 00:28.600
-Oh, yeah, who caved first?

00:28.640 --> 00:29.120
-She did.

00:29.160 --> 00:30.480
-He did.

00:30.519 --> 00:32.600
-Mom, we both know the only part
of me you've ever been

00:32.640 --> 00:33.840
interested in is dancing.

00:33.880 --> 00:37.359
-Actually, I'm cancelling
my tour commitments.

00:37.399 --> 00:39.719
You're going to go to school
as a day girl.

00:39.759 --> 00:41.840
-So I'll be staying
at home with you?

00:41.880 --> 00:44.359
-We're just going to have to
learn be a normal family.

00:44.399 --> 00:47.600
-Actually, new girl, we've
already made up our minds.

01:06.719 --> 01:09.640
THEME SONG: Take a breath.

01:09.680 --> 01:13.640
Close your eyes.

01:13.680 --> 01:18.599
Take a leap of faith, and
lead the way to life.

01:22.200 --> 01:23.560
This is my chance.

01:23.599 --> 01:27.519
This is my chance, my chance
to feel alive.

01:38.879 --> 01:41.519
INSTRUCTOR (OFFSCREEN): Allie.

01:41.560 --> 01:42.920
Trilby.

01:42.959 --> 01:46.159
KAT NARRATING: So far, I've
been to 17 ballet schools.

01:46.200 --> 01:49.480
That includes four in London,
two in Singapore, and an

01:49.519 --> 01:52.280
unfortunate month of classical
tutoring from a half-deaf

01:52.319 --> 01:54.400
sadist in Prague.

01:54.439 --> 01:58.319
The one thing that I never get
used to is being the new kid,

01:58.359 --> 02:01.200
that fear of being left out.

02:01.239 --> 02:04.640
-Gentlemen, we have a
new guy, Ben Tickle.

02:04.680 --> 02:06.400
First year couldn't contain
his mad skills.

02:06.439 --> 02:07.599
So he's been bumped up.

02:09.840 --> 02:10.639
Get into pairs.

02:10.680 --> 02:11.599
Someone bring Ben up to speed.

02:15.439 --> 02:17.800
KAT NARRATING: Usually you've
got about three seconds to

02:17.840 --> 02:20.080
make a decent first
impression.

02:20.120 --> 02:22.159
-Thanks, Mr. Lieberman.

02:22.199 --> 02:23.599
-The Liebermeister.

02:23.639 --> 02:26.439
KAT NARRATING: My usual tactic
is to make a splash.

02:26.479 --> 02:29.639
That way, in theory, you get to
choose your friends, rather

02:29.680 --> 02:31.080
than them choosing you.

02:37.680 --> 02:39.439
-Stop pretending it
doesn't hurt.

02:39.479 --> 02:40.800
-Like it's not easy
for you, too.

02:46.879 --> 02:48.680
KAT NARRATING: Now that I'm at
normal school, I don't want to

02:48.719 --> 02:50.400
stick out anymore.

02:50.439 --> 02:52.319
For once, I want to blend in.

02:54.759 --> 02:55.840
-You can have her.

02:55.879 --> 02:56.800
-No.

02:56.840 --> 02:57.439
Look at her.

02:57.479 --> 02:59.319
She's one of yours.

02:59.360 --> 03:01.479
-Lexie, Elke, one warning.

03:01.520 --> 03:05.120
Kat, join Elke's group.

03:05.159 --> 03:09.360
Now this next piece is all kinds
of exciting, because it

03:09.400 --> 03:11.759
requires you to use
two art forms--

03:11.800 --> 03:13.639
music and movement--

03:13.680 --> 03:15.479
to tell a dramatic story.

03:15.520 --> 03:16.599
-Ms. Fawsie?

03:16.639 --> 03:17.639
-Yes, Elke.

03:17.680 --> 03:20.319
You may use the spoken
word, as well.

03:20.360 --> 03:23.039
No, Lexie, it's not
a requirement.

03:23.080 --> 03:24.360
Let's get started.

03:24.400 --> 03:26.599
-So we're all boat people.

03:26.639 --> 03:29.680
And we're coming to Australia,
across the sea, while

03:29.719 --> 03:31.599
Gorecki's "Symphony of Sorrowful
Song" plays.

03:31.639 --> 03:33.479
-How do boat people
dance, again?

03:33.520 --> 03:36.680
-Trilby, I am so sick
of your negativity.

03:36.719 --> 03:38.639
-It's called realism, Elk.

03:38.680 --> 03:39.639
We have to keep it simple.

03:39.680 --> 03:40.639
You can't dance.

03:40.680 --> 03:41.560
I can't dance.

03:41.599 --> 03:43.800
Marissa and Darcy can't dance.

03:43.840 --> 03:45.240
What about you, new girl?

03:45.280 --> 03:48.199
Can you dance?

03:48.240 --> 03:49.759
-I've got it--

03:49.800 --> 03:52.199
a piece about humanity's
destruction of the

03:52.240 --> 03:53.800
environment.

03:53.840 --> 03:55.800
We can call it Gaia's
Vengeance.

03:55.840 --> 03:57.360
-That sounds like a
really good idea.

04:02.639 --> 04:04.319
-Girls' class is boring
without Kat.

04:04.360 --> 04:06.319
Do you reckon you could smuggle
me in with you?

04:06.360 --> 04:11.120
-You might need to grow some
wispy facial hair first.

04:11.159 --> 04:14.080
-Do the words third and wheel
mean anything to you guys?

04:21.680 --> 04:24.600
-Seriously, she's
your big threat?

04:24.639 --> 04:27.600
-Don' be fooled by the naive
country bumpkin act.

04:27.639 --> 04:29.800
The best pas de deux partner
and the assistant

04:29.839 --> 04:31.839
choreographer both succumbed.

04:31.879 --> 04:36.199
Basically, she owes her
status to pash rash.

04:36.240 --> 04:38.319
-You're funny.

04:38.360 --> 04:40.800
-I've always thought so.

04:40.839 --> 04:42.199
What do you bring
to the table?

04:42.240 --> 04:46.199
-You two, be quiet or chop.

04:46.240 --> 04:48.160
To the center.

04:48.199 --> 04:49.480
-I could even the
odds for you.

04:52.199 --> 04:55.480
-Really travel this, guys, and
explode that front foot into

04:55.519 --> 04:56.639
the air, yeah.

04:56.680 --> 04:59.480
Show me that [inaudible].

04:59.519 --> 05:01.839
OK, here we go.

05:01.879 --> 05:04.759
-You guys organizing that hip
hop night was so cool.

05:04.800 --> 05:07.120
But even before the tap on the
shoulder, I knew second year

05:07.160 --> 05:08.360
was where I belonged.

05:08.399 --> 05:10.160
-Shh.

05:10.199 --> 05:11.720
-I mean, I wouldn't call
first years immature.

05:11.759 --> 05:13.600
It's just like my mom says--

05:13.639 --> 05:15.160
I'm an old soul.

05:15.199 --> 05:15.639
-Old soul?

05:15.680 --> 05:16.199
-All right.

05:16.240 --> 05:16.959
We're up.

05:17.000 --> 05:18.680
-Five, six, seven, eight.

05:18.720 --> 05:20.279
[music playing]

05:27.680 --> 05:28.839
-Oooh.

05:33.240 --> 05:35.079
-So Ben, good stuff in there.

05:35.120 --> 05:36.040
-Thanks, Reed-o.

05:36.079 --> 05:37.079
Oh, and Ben's pretty boring.

05:37.120 --> 05:39.160
Must people call
me the Benster.

05:39.199 --> 05:40.480
-Really?

05:40.519 --> 05:43.319
-So did you do martial arts
before you danced?

05:43.360 --> 05:45.480
-No, why?

05:45.519 --> 05:48.199
-There was this Asian kid back
at dance school in Newy.

05:48.240 --> 05:49.519
He started out in Tae Kwon Do.

05:49.560 --> 05:51.600
You look a bit like him.

05:51.639 --> 05:52.279
-Yep.

05:52.319 --> 05:53.800
We all look the same.

05:53.839 --> 05:56.639
-Mate, that's a bit racist.

05:56.680 --> 06:00.079
-Cucumber on a sandwich,
that is so gay.

06:00.120 --> 06:00.839
-What?

06:00.879 --> 06:02.199
-I'm just taking them off.

06:02.240 --> 06:03.079
-That's what I mean.

06:03.120 --> 06:04.319
It's gay.

06:07.279 --> 06:08.199
-Newsflash.

06:08.240 --> 06:09.680
I think Abigail's
made a friend.

06:09.720 --> 06:11.120
Hi.

06:11.160 --> 06:15.720
-Tara, the Benster.

06:15.759 --> 06:17.160
-Have you always walked
funny, or did ballet

06:17.199 --> 06:19.519
make you that way?

06:19.560 --> 06:21.319
-What?

06:21.360 --> 06:22.160
-Ballet girls--

06:22.199 --> 06:23.360
they're so sensitive.

06:26.839 --> 06:28.600
-How do normal people walk?

06:28.639 --> 06:29.800
-Uh, heel toe.

06:29.839 --> 06:31.319
I think you're more toe heel.

06:31.360 --> 06:32.360
-Great.

06:32.399 --> 06:33.680
So I'll just, you know,
unlearn that.

06:33.720 --> 06:35.800
-Hey, we should come up with
a name for our gang--

06:35.839 --> 06:37.360
The Untouchables.

06:37.399 --> 06:38.079
-Yeah, that's great.

06:38.120 --> 06:39.240
That's appropriate.

06:39.279 --> 06:42.319
Um, look, can you just
excuse me a second?

06:42.360 --> 06:44.600
-You push me off balance
like yesterday, I will

06:44.639 --> 06:45.800
punch you in the brain.

06:45.839 --> 06:49.160
-It's good to see you
too, Abigail.

06:49.199 --> 06:51.160
-The fairy godmother
has spoken.

06:51.199 --> 06:53.399
My child, you shall
go to the ball.

06:53.439 --> 06:54.800
-Good afternoon, students.

06:54.839 --> 06:57.519
I have decided to make
some changes.

06:57.560 --> 06:58.720
You're swapping partners.

07:04.279 --> 07:05.480
Lovely, Abigail.

07:12.399 --> 07:13.399
-Stay with me, muscles.

07:13.439 --> 07:15.480
Come on.

07:15.519 --> 07:16.720
-Ow!

07:20.759 --> 07:23.319
Aw, is that really
necessary, Ben?

07:23.360 --> 07:24.360
-You want me to sweat less?

07:24.399 --> 07:25.600
You'd better lay off
the lamingtons.

07:29.720 --> 07:30.839
ABIGAIL (OFFSCREEN):
Thank you.

07:30.879 --> 07:32.480
-You owe me.

07:32.519 --> 07:37.199
-Celebration in my room,
seven o' clock.

07:37.240 --> 07:38.800
So how's school, kitten?

07:38.839 --> 07:40.160
Any fun activities?

07:40.199 --> 07:42.800
-Oh, like finger painting?

07:42.839 --> 07:45.759
Uh, best part was
probably drama.

07:45.800 --> 07:47.600
We're doing music and
movement piece.

07:47.639 --> 07:49.279
-Oh, is that like dance?

07:49.319 --> 07:50.480
-No.

07:50.519 --> 07:51.639
In fact, it's almost entirely
unlike dance.

08:02.519 --> 08:06.160
-It's a classic, isn't it?

08:06.199 --> 08:08.439
I'll get more carrot sticks.

08:08.480 --> 08:10.439
"Golden Steps 3"?

-If it's as good as one and
two, then I am there.

08:15.800 --> 08:17.439
-I'm actually pretty tired.

08:17.480 --> 08:19.800
-Hey, I wasn't criticizing.

08:19.839 --> 08:21.680
Let's bring this trilogy home.

08:21.720 --> 08:24.720
-I forgot, we have character
at 8:00.

08:24.759 --> 08:29.240
-OK, well, thanks for
the celebration.

08:29.279 --> 08:32.080
I had fun.

give me your arm.

to my welcome

09:00.879 --> 09:01.919
to second year party.

09:01.960 --> 09:03.320

after class.

I'm inviting all the second
years, but I'm

making you the co-host.

-So hold on.

09:11.759 --> 09:13.399
You're throwing yourself
a welcome party.

09:13.440 --> 09:14.720
-I'm kind of an alpha male.

09:14.759 --> 09:16.799
Except my stupid stamp
has run out of ink.

09:16.840 --> 09:18.399
That is gay.

09:18.440 --> 09:19.600
I'll see you guys there?

09:19.639 --> 09:21.080
-I wouldn't miss it.

09:24.320 --> 09:25.200
-No stamp, drat.

09:25.240 --> 09:26.480
I guess I can't go.

09:26.519 --> 09:28.559
-No, you guys have to come.

09:28.600 --> 09:29.840
-I don't think so.

09:29.879 --> 09:31.799
-Well, you just said
you would.

09:31.840 --> 09:35.320
OK, [inaudible] not just
for Christmas.

09:35.360 --> 09:38.080
-Where did that come from?

09:38.120 --> 09:43.320
-Seven, eight, we are glaciers,

09:43.360 --> 09:45.559
shedding ice as we recede.

09:45.600 --> 09:48.480
-Shake out your dandruff,
girls.

09:48.519 --> 09:50.679
-Look, we only have
to be better than

09:50.720 --> 09:52.000

09:52.039 --> 09:54.679
And they're doing nothing.

-That's Geri Scherm.

choreographer.

She's pretty good, actually.

-What?

10:13.519 --> 10:16.039
-You know her name, and you
know her specialty.

-Look, we thought you were like
Lexie, only more boring.

us beat her.

-I did.

don't dance anymore.

I do have some connections.

"Golden Steps 3." It's just

I'll call an ambulance.

21:11.720 --> 21:14.319
I'm recommending they hire a
smarter sales assistant.

21:14.359 --> 21:16.319
I don't want to be mistaken
for a thief

21:16.359 --> 21:18.119
or some B-list celebrity.

21:18.160 --> 21:19.440
-Well, you still
had fun, right?

21:19.480 --> 21:20.079
-Yeah.

21:20.119 --> 21:21.240
You coming?

21:35.359 --> 21:38.720
-So we're good, right?

21:38.759 --> 21:41.519
-Yeah.

21:41.559 --> 21:46.559
It's just, you and Tara
being so full on.

21:46.599 --> 21:49.400
Little bit adjusting to.

21:49.440 --> 21:51.720
-OK.

21:51.759 --> 21:53.240
-It's gross, obviously.

21:53.279 --> 21:57.079
But, yeah, it's great.

21:57.119 --> 22:02.000
-Well, honestly, I, I haven't
really known how to play it.

22:02.039 --> 22:03.400
You said things were
cool between us.

22:03.440 --> 22:05.720
-Yeah, it is.

22:05.759 --> 22:07.240
I don't feel the same
way I did last year.

22:07.279 --> 22:08.720
That's gone.

22:08.759 --> 22:11.359
But it did mean something,
I guess.

22:11.400 --> 22:16.319
At some stage I have to figure
out what, you know?

22:16.359 --> 22:17.319
-Yeah.

22:17.359 --> 22:18.240
Come on.

22:18.279 --> 22:19.480
Let's go.

22:22.160 --> 22:25.519
-Boys, hey, look, um, I made
you rainbow cupcakes.

22:29.680 --> 22:34.720
When I said that's so gay, I
didn't mean to offend you.

22:34.759 --> 22:36.720
-Um, OK.

22:36.759 --> 22:39.359
-Uh, wait, that's a bad
turn of phrase.

22:39.400 --> 22:45.039
Um, look, it, it's totally
cool that you guys are--

22:45.079 --> 22:46.240
yeah.

22:56.559 --> 22:58.000
-[sighing]

22:58.039 --> 23:00.039
Ben, mate, the cupcakes--

23:00.079 --> 23:01.599
KAT NARRATING: The toughest
thing about being kicked out

23:01.640 --> 23:03.559
of the Academy wasn't that
I didn't fit in.

23:03.599 --> 23:05.039
-Oh.

23:05.079 --> 23:06.519
-Excuse us.

23:06.559 --> 23:07.960
-Sorry, partner.

23:08.000 --> 23:10.200
KAT NARRATING: It was how much
I did fit with the people

23:10.240 --> 23:12.240
there, my friends.

23:12.279 --> 23:13.599
-Hello.

23:13.640 --> 23:14.559
KAT NARRATING: I don't know how
things are going to work

23:14.599 --> 23:16.400
with school number 18.

23:16.440 --> 23:18.359
-Hey, are you the one that
got rejected last year?

23:18.400 --> 23:19.960
-I don't think I've found
my place yet.

23:20.000 --> 23:21.519
-The very same.

23:21.559 --> 23:22.640
You are Ben?

23:22.680 --> 23:26.079
-Call me Benster.

23:26.119 --> 23:28.640
No one gets to pick their
own nickname, Ben.

23:28.680 --> 23:29.680
-She's awesome.

23:29.720 --> 23:32.319
Hey, she should be
part of our gang.

23:32.359 --> 23:34.240
-Can I be a part of your gang?

23:34.279 --> 23:35.720
KAT NARRATING: But I know
who I fit with.

23:35.759 --> 23:38.559
And maybe that's
enough for now.

23:38.599 --> 23:45.519
