NARRATOR:
<i>Previously on </i>Hill Street Blues...

00:03.294 --> 00:05.755
-(electricity crackling)
-(gasping)

00:05.839 --> 00:10.510
Congratulations to Officer Renko
on the birth of a brand-new baby daughter.

00:10.593 --> 00:12.429
(cheering, applauding)

00:12.512 --> 00:15.181
...Rachel, and the kid's
asleep in the next room.

00:15.974 --> 00:16.850
What happened?

00:17.642 --> 00:21.062
(inhales) Four o'clock this morning,
she was attacked. Raped.

00:21.146 --> 00:22.689
-How do you feel?
-Tired.

00:22.772 --> 00:24.065
-Happy we talked.
-So am I.

00:24.149 --> 00:27.402
I'm almost embarrassed, yet I'm happier
than I've been in four months.

00:27.485 --> 00:31.156
Rachel, we know who the guy is.
You can put him away, for God's sake.

00:31.239 --> 00:32.741
Let someone else be a hero.

00:32.824 --> 00:36.619
I will not let that animal violate my life
any more than he already has.

00:38.580 --> 00:40.123
Is that the knife you used, James?

00:40.623 --> 00:42.542
Is that the knife you held to her throat
while you raped her?

00:42.625 --> 00:46.046
-My name's Cathleen McConnell.
-Pleased to meet you, Cathleen McConnell.

00:46.129 --> 00:48.298
Pleased to meet you, Henry Goldblume.

00:50.050 --> 00:51.426
I know capital punishment's wrong,

00:51.509 --> 00:54.679
but if I go just with my feelings,
I got blood up to my elbows.

00:56.431 --> 01:00.143
-(chattering)
-Okay, all right, hold it down. Item four.

01:01.227 --> 01:03.396
Welcome to first tour officers,

01:03.480 --> 01:05.899
Randall Buttman and Lawrence Swan.

01:05.982 --> 01:07.192
(chuckles)

01:07.275 --> 01:11.488
These guys are, uh, Hill Street's pick
of this year's police academy litter.

01:11.571 --> 01:12.614
Step forward.

01:13.740 --> 01:14.866
-I'm Buttman.
-I'm Renko.

01:14.949 --> 01:16.201
I'm Hill.

01:16.284 --> 01:18.703
Rookies will ride... Buttman with Bates.

01:18.787 --> 01:20.413
Swan with Coffey.

01:20.497 --> 01:23.708
I'm gonna take Swan
and Coffey will take Buttman.

01:25.752 --> 01:26.961
Okay.

01:27.504 --> 01:28.505
Item five.

01:28.963 --> 01:33.176
Last night another prostitute
was found murdered, 137 and Euclid.

01:33.259 --> 01:35.929
It's our first,
but the Heights has already had two,

01:36.012 --> 01:38.932
and Polk Avenue another,
all with the same MO.

01:39.015 --> 01:40.892
Some john bludgeoned them to death.

01:41.267 --> 01:44.896
Let's see if we can work up some
leads among the sidewalk Sadies.

01:45.897 --> 01:48.024
-They got a right to breathe, too.
-(man coughs)

01:48.608 --> 01:51.569
Item six, Operation Airwave.

01:52.403 --> 01:55.740
Cable TV companies have been
putting the arm on Division

01:55.824 --> 01:59.911
to enforce the new vector
electronic services law.

01:59.994 --> 02:01.746
Estimates are we've got four times

02:01.830 --> 02:04.541
as many people stealing the cable
as paying for it.

02:04.624 --> 02:06.167
That include cops, Sarge?

02:07.377 --> 02:08.711
We got something here, Detective?

02:08.795 --> 02:11.005
Saying a few guys in this room
don't pay for it, either.

02:11.089 --> 02:13.216
Why don't you mind your own
business there, boy?

02:13.758 --> 02:14.968
STAN: Well, I do.

02:15.677 --> 02:18.054
Uh, anybody wanna turn themselves in?

02:18.471 --> 02:19.389
(mumbling)

02:19.889 --> 02:22.684
Garibaldi here will be
taking the collars on this,

02:22.767 --> 02:26.729
since it's him and Mayo
draw this plum assignment.

02:26.813 --> 02:31.025
They'll be going after the installers,
commencing stakeout at 1600 Archibald,

02:31.109 --> 02:33.486
the Norman Arms, where we've been tipped
that an individual's

02:33.570 --> 02:35.864
wiring the entire apartment complex.

02:36.573 --> 02:37.866
-Item seven.
-(pen scratches)

02:39.200 --> 02:42.078
Also Garibaldi and Mayo.

02:43.037 --> 02:44.581
You two draw a double shift.

02:45.373 --> 02:48.251
Berman and Frisch from the night tour
are both out with the flu.

02:48.334 --> 02:49.252
Item eight.

02:51.045 --> 02:54.090
Forty-eight percent
robbery jump in fast food joints

02:54.174 --> 02:56.176
along the Dekker Business Sector.

02:56.259 --> 02:58.845
Detective Mike Belker undercover today

02:58.928 --> 03:01.222
at Uncle Fryer's Chicken Kitchen
number 12.

03:01.306 --> 03:02.223
(man imitates clucking)

03:02.307 --> 03:04.934
Dekker and Devane,
Sherman and Gray are backup.

03:05.018 --> 03:05.977
(officers clucking)

03:06.060 --> 03:07.562
Let's go lay an egg out there, Detective.

03:07.645 --> 03:09.105
(laughter)

03:09.189 --> 03:10.899
(growls)

03:10.982 --> 03:13.568
(chuckles) Don't get that wrong.

03:14.194 --> 03:16.362
Where I'll sometimes rib with you.

03:17.155 --> 03:21.326
Uh, sometimes seem to, you know,
get on off at your expense.

03:23.077 --> 03:24.913
All right. Let's roll.

03:24.996 --> 03:28.499
Let's get out there. Let's do it to them
before they do it to us.

03:30.752 --> 03:32.921
Don't let's lay no eggs, now. (chuckles)

03:39.135 --> 03:41.054
-So what do you like, "Larry"?
-That's fine.

03:41.137 --> 03:42.472
Nobody likes a Lawrence.

03:42.889 --> 03:45.516
Hey, just asking the guy his preference.

03:47.185 --> 03:48.686
And you must be "Randy"?

03:48.770 --> 03:52.023
-Randy or...
-Yeah.

03:53.399 --> 03:54.359
HENRY: Would you believe it?

03:54.442 --> 03:56.611
The guy threatens to kill
my kids, rapes my ex-wife

03:56.694 --> 03:59.280
and then he gets a bail
he can make out of pocket change.

03:59.989 --> 04:04.702
That's because he was charged
only on old warrants.

04:04.786 --> 04:06.955
-How do you know?
-ADA phoned from night court.

04:07.038 --> 04:08.706
He decided to drop the new charges

04:08.790 --> 04:11.209
in order to avoid a counter-charge
of police brutality,

04:11.292 --> 04:12.877
which he wasn't sure he could beat.

04:12.961 --> 04:14.420
It seems that Fitzsimmons had to be

04:14.504 --> 04:16.464
treated at Mercy Hospital
before he could be arraigned.

04:16.798 --> 04:19.884
A resident concluded he had been beaten
because he was passing blood.

04:20.969 --> 04:22.011
The guy resisted.

04:25.306 --> 04:28.101
(sighs) Look, Frank, I'm sorry.
I was wrong. I lost it.

04:28.184 --> 04:29.310
When you asked for the day yesterday,

04:29.394 --> 04:31.104
I presumed it was to spend time
with Rachel.

04:31.187 --> 04:33.398
I didn't think you'd be out
on a vigilante mission.

04:33.481 --> 04:36.234
I said I was sorry. I told you yesterday
I was having a small problem.

04:36.317 --> 04:38.611
It's not a small problem!
And I won't have it.

04:42.031 --> 04:44.742
-(telephone ringing)
-(chattering)

04:50.915 --> 04:51.749
Henry!

04:55.712 --> 04:58.673
-Henry, I really gotta thank you, buddy.
-How's that, J.D.?

04:58.756 --> 05:01.217
Because you're a stand-up guy.
A man of conviction.

05:01.301 --> 05:03.011
-What are you talking about?
-I'm talking about

05:03.094 --> 05:06.139
I'm batting around .025
picking this broad up

05:06.222 --> 05:07.890
the other night at Mulligan's
till I find out

05:07.974 --> 05:10.727
she's a heavyweight
anti-capital punishment nut.

05:10.810 --> 05:12.437
The kid tells her he's you.

05:12.520 --> 05:16.482
I show her our name in that newspaper ad
and an hour later, we're in her ballpark

05:16.566 --> 05:19.277
and LaRue is doing his
famous home run trot.

05:20.361 --> 05:21.654
I'm really happy for you.

05:26.117 --> 05:27.577
Damn. Henry?

05:28.244 --> 05:29.287
Cathleen!

05:29.370 --> 05:32.665
Hey, my wallet!
You know, I just realized I lost this.

05:32.749 --> 05:35.543
-You're really sweet to bring it up.
-Not at all, "Henry."

05:36.669 --> 05:39.714
Oh, hey, I bet you, uh, noticed
some of my fake ID, huh?

05:39.797 --> 05:41.591
-You mean for John LaRue?
-Yeah, that's right.

05:41.674 --> 05:44.177
Yeah, like late payment warnings,
disconnect notices...

05:44.260 --> 05:45.762
Yeah, well, you know,
this was for this undercover--

05:45.845 --> 05:47.513
No sale, creep!

05:48.056 --> 05:51.851
STAN: Whoa, okay ma'am.
That's it, that's quits.

05:51.934 --> 05:53.853
Get your hands off me.

05:53.936 --> 05:55.772
Right. You got it.

05:58.941 --> 05:59.859
Never touched her.

06:00.360 --> 06:03.196
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch. We have a 9-11.</i>

06:03.279 --> 06:04.739
<i>Armed robbery in progress.</i>

06:04.822 --> 06:09.118
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner of People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

06:09.202 --> 06:10.536
(sirens wailing)

06:16.000 --> 06:18.628
(theme music playing)

07:28.531 --> 07:29.699
MAN: Hey, hey, taxi!

07:31.325 --> 07:32.869
MANAGER: You know what this
company's motto oughta be?

07:32.952 --> 07:33.786
MICK: What?

07:33.870 --> 07:36.706
The left hand don't know
what the right hand's doing.

07:37.039 --> 07:39.292
They send three weeks' worth
of promotional material

07:39.375 --> 07:40.793
on pumping up breakfast trade.

07:40.877 --> 07:42.920
They promise an Uncle Fryer egg man

07:43.004 --> 07:44.839
out in front of all
the Uncle Fryers out there.

07:44.922 --> 07:46.841
I don't have an egg outfit, sir.

07:46.924 --> 07:48.801
This is the only outfit they gave me.

07:48.885 --> 07:52.847
Look, I don't want a chicken out in front
of my store before 10:30 a.m.

07:52.930 --> 07:54.849
People don't buy chicken
that early in the morning.

07:54.932 --> 07:56.350
I have an idea, sir.

07:56.684 --> 07:58.311
How about if I yell,

07:58.394 --> 08:00.688
"The best eggs come
from the best chickens"?

08:00.771 --> 08:03.274
No, really. I mean, I think
we can make this outfit work.

08:03.691 --> 08:04.942
Yeah, well that might be a way to go.

08:05.026 --> 08:07.778
All right, good. Good.
Where would you like me to stand?

08:07.862 --> 08:10.907
I want you to walk
back and forth in front of the store.

08:10.990 --> 08:13.451
-Who the hell is this guy?
-A jerk.

08:14.327 --> 08:16.454
He works this corner over here.
Just ignore him.

08:16.913 --> 08:19.874
He's early. All right, buddy,
go ahead, beat it. Go on.

08:21.834 --> 08:26.506
Okay, you get ten minutes off every hour,
40 percent discount off on all food.

08:26.756 --> 08:28.257
I hope you're not hungry.

08:33.137 --> 08:35.723
Don't give me any trouble,
do you understand that?

08:37.600 --> 08:39.060
(growls)

08:41.604 --> 08:44.440
-(phones ringing)
-(chattering)

08:47.818 --> 08:48.778
Good morning.

08:49.529 --> 08:52.406
Madam, this is a police report

08:52.490 --> 08:55.826
that you have treated
with such incendiary carelessness.

08:57.453 --> 08:58.913
-I burned it.
-Mm-hmm.

08:59.539 --> 09:03.167
I'm sorry, Lieutenant,
but it's mainly on the border.

09:03.251 --> 09:05.920
Well, this sort of clerical incompetence
is insupportable,

09:06.003 --> 09:09.507
and I might add it is not the first time
that I have observed it in you.

09:10.174 --> 09:11.509
Well, you smoke a pipe.

09:12.593 --> 09:16.556
Uh, rigorously reasoned
and it's only 9:28.

09:16.847 --> 09:17.682
What does that mean?

09:17.765 --> 09:21.477
That means that smoking
is not the issue, Clerk Kimmel.

09:22.186 --> 09:25.189
But rather your porcine slovenliness.

09:26.399 --> 09:27.358
Porcine?

09:28.109 --> 09:28.943
Pork.

09:31.821 --> 09:32.947
No way.

09:34.907 --> 09:37.660
-No way do I take that!
-(folder slams)

09:37.743 --> 09:40.871
Judas Priest, I consider
myself the offended party,

09:40.955 --> 09:44.125
and Ms. Kimmel, I intend to seek redress

09:44.208 --> 09:48.713
regarding the repeated
charring of my 914-salmons.

09:48.796 --> 09:49.839
-Forget it!
-(door slams)

09:49.922 --> 09:51.757
(door lock clicks)

09:52.341 --> 09:55.845
(chuckles) That's par for your course.

09:55.928 --> 09:57.847
You're in the wrong lavatory!

09:58.347 --> 10:00.308
-(scrapes)
-(rattles door)

10:01.058 --> 10:03.394
I say you're in the wrong lavatory.

10:05.062 --> 10:06.105
(rattling)

10:06.647 --> 10:08.482
The woman's barricading herself.

10:09.442 --> 10:11.277
Think we should take her out of the game?

10:13.154 --> 10:14.322
Seems premature.

10:14.405 --> 10:17.283
Lieutenant? Homicide. 1437 Marshall.

10:17.700 --> 10:20.620
-(loud scraping)
-(thuds)

10:24.498 --> 10:27.835
Cathleen, whatever your name was,
take poison and die.

10:27.918 --> 10:29.920
-Man, I've learned--
-(police siren wailing)

10:30.004 --> 10:32.506
-(car door closes)
-(police siren continues)

10:34.634 --> 10:36.260
Hill Street detectives, ma'am,
thanks a lot.

10:36.344 --> 10:38.179
I got the incident report
right here for you fellas.

10:38.262 --> 10:39.513
Yeah, we'll take over from there, thanks.

10:39.597 --> 10:41.098
Look at that. Isn't that a shame?

10:41.182 --> 10:44.310
They broke in in broad daylight.
They took my radio and my tape deck.

10:44.393 --> 10:46.812
That's why I tell you to park
in the underground, Ms. Reynolds.

10:46.896 --> 10:49.106
I do volunteer work here at the hospital.

10:49.190 --> 10:50.483
Yeah? Good for you.

10:51.317 --> 10:55.029
Uh, really. Thanks for your help, sport.
We'll carry the ball from here.

10:55.655 --> 10:57.615
I'd be happy to stay here with you, ma'am.

10:57.698 --> 11:00.534
Yeah, but then you'd miss
your appointment. At the hearing clinic.

11:00.618 --> 11:03.079
Hey, uh, that happened
on a city street, my man.

11:03.162 --> 11:04.997
Let the public servants do our job, okay?

11:05.665 --> 11:07.083
You can go over the report with me.

11:08.793 --> 11:10.961
-How you doing?
-All right, I guess.

11:11.045 --> 11:12.505
I just feel so invaded.

11:12.963 --> 11:14.048
Have you got a little time?

11:14.924 --> 11:17.426
-What do you mean?
-Well, like, 30 or 45 minutes.

11:17.510 --> 11:21.013
If we work up a thorough theft report
and get the information out fast,

11:21.097 --> 11:23.265
our chances of catching
whoever did this go way up.

11:23.933 --> 11:25.434
(scoffs) Well, I'd be happy to cooperate,

11:25.518 --> 11:27.186
but I only caught
the barest glimpse of them.

11:27.269 --> 11:28.938
Well, sometimes that's enough.

11:29.021 --> 11:30.648
Why don't you come to the station house?

11:31.691 --> 11:33.317
-All right.
-Want me to drive?

11:33.609 --> 11:34.819
No, that isn't necessary.

11:34.902 --> 11:36.987
J.D.: Necessary
isn't where it's at, ma'am.

11:37.571 --> 11:38.739
I mean, would it help you?

11:38.823 --> 11:40.282
Are you still feeling a little shaky?

11:41.450 --> 11:43.953
-Please.
-Uh, Detective Washington,

11:44.036 --> 11:45.996
why don't you follow us in her car.

11:47.164 --> 11:48.040
Sure.

11:50.334 --> 11:51.877
RENKO: Landlady called in a domestic.

11:51.961 --> 11:53.546
Folks, let me and the lieutenant by here--

11:53.629 --> 11:54.463
Anyway, we got here

11:54.547 --> 11:58.050
and she said the fighting stopped
about a hour and a half ago.

11:58.134 --> 12:00.886
Meantime, this little girl
is the victim's common-law.

12:02.888 --> 12:05.975
-What's the matter?
-I was here yesterday.

12:06.600 --> 12:09.729
-Related incident. Did you call SID?
-Yeah, they're on the way.

12:09.812 --> 12:11.772
I saw you before.

12:11.856 --> 12:13.065
-Yes, ma'am.
-Looking for Jimmy.

12:13.149 --> 12:16.235
Guy we want's James Thomas Fitzsimmons,
no aliases.

12:16.318 --> 12:18.738
I'm going back to the station house.
Get it to work.

12:18.821 --> 12:20.573
-Did you run this for SID?
-Yeah.

12:21.240 --> 12:22.324
Well, I thought you arrested him.

12:22.408 --> 12:24.785
All kinds of warrants
and charges and everything.

12:24.869 --> 12:25.703
I did.

12:26.203 --> 12:28.456
Well, then what happened for God's sake?

12:29.582 --> 12:31.917
(Randy whistling)

12:33.711 --> 12:35.504
Hey, Randy, could you put your foot down?

12:35.880 --> 12:37.965
-Sure, sorry.
-No problem.

12:38.632 --> 12:41.761
I gotta tell you, Joe, this is a little
bit like Disneyland for me.

12:41.844 --> 12:43.679
-How's that?
-Riding with you.

12:43.888 --> 12:44.972
(chuckles) Oh, yeah?

12:46.182 --> 12:47.975
You got a great reputation, man.

12:48.392 --> 12:50.728
Hey, man, I'm just--
I'm just a street cop.

12:50.811 --> 12:54.064
Come on, everyone says you're the ace
skirt man at the department.

12:55.357 --> 12:56.776
Hey, you're doing that
with your foot again.

12:56.859 --> 12:57.735
Sorry.

12:59.028 --> 13:01.280
Hey, listen, Joe, you know we're having
kind of a rookie thing

13:01.363 --> 13:03.199
in the back room of Kubiak tonight.

13:03.282 --> 13:05.826
Rookies from the Hill, Polk Avenue,
the Heights...

13:05.910 --> 13:09.455
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah, uh, if you happen to be out front,

13:09.538 --> 13:12.458
you might be in a position
for a little prime gonzola.

13:12.541 --> 13:14.293
If you don't mind working with a pro.

13:15.169 --> 13:16.212
I'll pass.

13:17.129 --> 13:19.381
Okay. (clicks tongue)
Just thought I'd let you know.

13:19.465 --> 13:20.841
Hey, look, do me a favor.

13:20.925 --> 13:23.719
Don't do that where you make
your finger like it's a gun, all right?

13:23.803 --> 13:24.887
-I don't like that.
-Okay.

13:25.554 --> 13:27.556
WOMAN (over radio):<i> Unit 2203, respond.</i>

13:28.265 --> 13:29.475
Yeah, 2203.

13:29.934 --> 13:34.313
<i>2203, back-up and street disturbance,</i>
<i>Marion and Decker, do you copy?</i>

13:34.522 --> 13:36.565
-(car engine revving)
-2203 responding.

13:36.816 --> 13:38.609
-Want some bubblegum?
-(police siren wailing)

13:38.692 --> 13:41.362
-Dude, you crazy!
-Get back.

13:41.445 --> 13:43.113
Dude's crazy! Dude, you're crazy!

13:43.197 --> 13:46.116
-(people shouting)
-You're gonna cut me off no more, are you?

13:46.200 --> 13:48.577
You're going to jail, man!
You're going right to jail!

13:48.661 --> 13:51.288
-(glasses breaks)
-(police siren wailing)

13:51.372 --> 13:53.958
Get him outta here!
He's gonna kill somebody with that!

13:54.041 --> 13:56.794
What you guys gonna do?
Stand there and let him demolish that car?

13:56.877 --> 13:59.213
-(banging)
-(chattering)

14:00.548 --> 14:01.632
LUCY: Hey, Rufus!

14:02.508 --> 14:04.343
(banging car continue)

14:05.678 --> 14:08.597
MAN: Dude's crazy, man!
Get him outta here!

14:08.681 --> 14:12.643
(overlapping shouts)

14:12.726 --> 14:15.729
-COFFEY: What's the shot, man?
-Man, you'd better cool it, blood!

14:15.813 --> 14:16.689
What's the shot?

14:16.772 --> 14:19.650
Man come out with that tire iron
like a crazy man!

14:20.484 --> 14:25.030
-MAN: Hey, get that man away!
-(overlapping shouts)

14:25.489 --> 14:27.074
Hey, is he the driver?

14:27.533 --> 14:29.410
What y'all gonna do,
stand there with your thumbs up, or what?

14:29.493 --> 14:31.871
Sir, I told you... to be quiet.

14:31.954 --> 14:34.415
Trying to talk this clown down,
but the kid is scared.

14:36.333 --> 14:37.877
-RANDY: You back off, turkey!
-Hey!

14:37.960 --> 14:40.880
Hey, Randy, easy, man!
If he's dusted, you'll flip him!

14:40.963 --> 14:42.172
Just take it easy.

14:42.256 --> 14:44.550
No, you take it easy.
That man gave me an obscene finger.

14:44.633 --> 14:45.843
Hey, what's your name?

14:45.926 --> 14:47.428
-Ruf--
-LUCY: Rufus, Rufus.

14:47.511 --> 14:49.680
Hey, look, Rufus, we don't
want any more damage, all right?

14:49.763 --> 14:50.639
I'm not looking for damage.

14:51.098 --> 14:52.641
But don't try to come over me, man.

14:52.725 --> 14:54.435
-Don't come wrong.
-Hey, I'm with you.

14:54.518 --> 14:56.437
All right, just take it real easy.

14:56.520 --> 14:58.772
What do you say
you just put that tire iron down, huh?

14:59.982 --> 15:01.483
Man came in my lane.

15:02.151 --> 15:03.694
But I'm gonna put it down, okay?

15:03.777 --> 15:05.738
-All right, spread 'em.
-Ow!

15:05.821 --> 15:08.574
(all yelling)

15:11.535 --> 15:13.621
(screams)

15:13.704 --> 15:15.414
(grunts)

15:15.497 --> 15:17.541
(yelling, screaming)

15:17.625 --> 15:19.209
-(thuds)
-(grunts)

15:20.961 --> 15:22.755
Cuff him, that's it, just cuff him!

15:22.838 --> 15:24.840
(man shouting)

15:24.924 --> 15:25.966
Get out!

15:28.135 --> 15:29.637
(mocking) Read him his rights?

15:29.720 --> 15:31.889
-JOE: Just calm down, Rufus.
-Shut up!

15:31.972 --> 15:33.724
You have the right to remain silent...

15:34.141 --> 15:38.103
(police siren wailing)

15:38.938 --> 15:42.483
I don't know. I was going out
with this guy for a while.

15:43.067 --> 15:45.903
-Yeah? Did you like him?
-More than a little.

15:46.403 --> 15:47.655
But he stopped calling.

15:48.447 --> 15:50.157
-He's crazy.
-(dog barking)

15:50.240 --> 15:51.492
No, just particular.

15:53.285 --> 15:54.662
-(dog barks)
-Harry...

15:55.913 --> 15:57.498
if you liked a woman,

15:58.415 --> 16:01.585
but there was something maybe you didn't
like so much about her--

16:02.086 --> 16:04.797
I mean, physically,
could you still enjoy her?

16:05.214 --> 16:06.590
Well, what are we talking here, Patsy,

16:06.674 --> 16:09.218
we talking a big mole with hair sticking
out of it or what?

16:12.304 --> 16:15.808
No, Harry, we're not talking about
a big mole with a hair sticking out of it.

16:16.433 --> 16:17.267
Well, what then?

16:19.269 --> 16:23.023
-Well, what about breasts?
-Breasts?

16:24.024 --> 16:25.943
You think I should get my attic insulated?

16:27.778 --> 16:28.988
Patsy, we talking falsies?

16:29.071 --> 16:30.572
No, we're talking implants.

16:31.156 --> 16:31.991
You?

16:33.909 --> 16:36.161
Uh, well, Pats,
you're talking to a leg man.

16:36.787 --> 16:37.997
Seriously.

16:38.247 --> 16:40.290
Maybe I'd feel better about myself.

16:40.666 --> 16:41.834
Really? Seriously?

16:41.917 --> 16:44.253
I mean, from a man's point of view,

16:44.795 --> 16:48.799
would a woman with breast implants
be a plus or minus?

16:50.551 --> 16:52.594
Well, Pats, this is a judgment call.

16:52.970 --> 16:54.847
And nobody with your best interests
at heart

16:54.930 --> 16:56.765
is gonna make that call sight unseen.

16:58.976 --> 17:00.185
Great, Harry.

17:00.769 --> 17:03.480
-Am I your best shot this week?
-I'm just trying to be objective.

17:03.564 --> 17:05.315
Because if I am, you're outta luck.

17:05.399 --> 17:07.067
These are not in your future.

17:07.151 --> 17:09.737
-Fine, pass up expert advice.
-I will, thank you.

17:09.820 --> 17:11.113
-Fine.
-Hey.

17:11.363 --> 17:12.364
(Harry clears throat)

17:12.781 --> 17:15.617
-HARRY: Uh, excuse me sir?
-What?

17:15.951 --> 17:17.161
-I'm busy.
-Please halt!

17:18.412 --> 17:20.039
Look, I hate getting out of breath, chump.

17:20.122 --> 17:21.999
-Hey, I didn't do nothing wrong.
-Yeah right.

17:22.082 --> 17:24.918
-Theft of service, cable fraud.
-Hey, write me a ticket.

17:25.002 --> 17:27.212
-Uh-uh, buddy, we're taking you in.
-Oh, man.

17:27.296 --> 17:28.756
You have the right to remain silent.

17:28.839 --> 17:30.549
If you give up
the right to remain silent...

17:30.632 --> 17:32.051
I understand Fitzsimmons's
common-law was murdered.

17:32.134 --> 17:35.512
We got blood samples, fibers, clothes.
I'm asking for priority SID.

17:35.596 --> 17:37.139
You can't have the case, Henry, I'm sorry.

17:37.222 --> 17:40.392
Frank, I know the arguments,
believe me. I'm aware.

17:41.435 --> 17:42.811
Just don't want that animal
out there anymore.

17:42.895 --> 17:43.729
Oh, and we do?

17:44.313 --> 17:45.731
He rapes your wife murders his girlfriend

17:45.814 --> 17:47.775
and we want to see him
get through medical school?

17:47.858 --> 17:49.068
Give your notes to Neal.

17:49.443 --> 17:50.861
Thinking if I hadn't hit him
he'd still be in?

17:50.944 --> 17:52.029
Frankly, yes.

18:03.207 --> 18:06.668
-Any developments on Fitzsimmons?
-Yeah, I got a snitch who knows the dude.

18:06.752 --> 18:07.628
Waiting for his call.

18:07.711 --> 18:09.129
-Keep me current?
-Deal.

18:09.546 --> 18:13.717
Detective, uh, I have to go.
I'm sorry, I've got some appointments,

18:13.801 --> 18:16.261
but I'll be happy to cooperate
any way I can.

18:16.929 --> 18:18.263
Thank you very much.

18:18.806 --> 18:19.932
Uh, yeah, look, uh...

18:20.015 --> 18:24.937
Hey, maybe, uh, you drop back by later,
you know, eyeball some more mugshots.

18:25.020 --> 18:26.396
Uh, well...

18:27.731 --> 18:30.442
You couldn't bring them to my place,
could you?

18:31.777 --> 18:32.611
Yeah.

18:33.112 --> 18:34.738
Yeah, that can be arranged.

18:35.030 --> 18:36.907
-Three?
-Three.

18:37.324 --> 18:38.158
Good.

18:39.785 --> 18:42.412
-LUCY: What do you got?
-(stuttering)

18:43.205 --> 18:46.708
-Disorderly conduct--
-I just told the man, don't come rollin',

18:46.792 --> 18:48.001
next thing I know
they're throwing me on the ground.

18:48.085 --> 18:49.795
-LUCY: Rufus, pipe down!
-Easy, man.

18:49.878 --> 18:51.380
How'd you like to play her down?

18:52.548 --> 18:53.423
What'd you say, Buttman?

18:54.550 --> 18:56.301
-Nothing, sorry.
-Come on, let's go.

18:56.385 --> 18:58.554
Hey, what you looking at him
for when I'm talking to you?

19:01.306 --> 19:02.933
What is this, premenstrual or something?

19:03.851 --> 19:06.436
Please. Who are you, Clubber, Slugger,
whatever you think you are?

19:06.520 --> 19:08.814
Come on, right now, badges off.
Outside, you and me. Come on!

19:08.897 --> 19:11.233
-Come on, can you take that?
-COFFEY: Buttman, walk away.

19:11.984 --> 19:14.153
-Sergeant Bates. Sergeant Bates.
-What?

19:14.236 --> 19:17.281
-Let's have a little consultation.
-I am talkin' to this jerk right now!

19:17.364 --> 19:19.366
So talk to me now, jerk number two.

19:24.788 --> 19:27.457
Captain, we got an installer
wants to roll on his client list.

19:27.541 --> 19:29.376
You know, the people
that are getting hooked up?

19:29.626 --> 19:30.878
Call the DA's office.

19:31.253 --> 19:32.296
Anything they want to do?

19:32.504 --> 19:34.298
Got some real heavy dudes, man.

19:35.007 --> 19:37.843
You bust these people,
you get on the news.

19:39.595 --> 19:40.721
(grunts)

19:41.388 --> 19:44.266
-I don't want to have to be handled, okay?
-STAN: I couldn't agree with you more.

19:44.349 --> 19:46.310
Just burns me
that he had to make that reference.

19:46.393 --> 19:47.853
Plus the lack of respect.

19:48.520 --> 19:50.647
I mean, I say to the kid
to do something, right?

19:50.731 --> 19:53.734
I'm the sergeant and he looks
to Coffey to see if he has to.

19:53.817 --> 19:55.652
So you know what'd I tell you
about that, Sergeant Bates?

19:55.736 --> 19:57.654
-Sergeant to sergeant?
-What?

19:57.738 --> 20:00.282
The world is full of a number of swines.

20:01.658 --> 20:03.619
-And what does that mean?
-Think about it.

20:05.996 --> 20:08.373
On this matter of respect, Sergeant, uh,

20:08.582 --> 20:10.918
you wouldn't have been having a little
hard time with me, personally,

20:11.001 --> 20:13.712
-since I come up here, would you?
-Why is that?

20:14.171 --> 20:17.633
Just seems certain occasions
I'll say "X," you'll say "Y."

20:18.258 --> 20:19.551
And what are you referring to?

20:20.302 --> 20:22.012
For instance, this a.m. turnout.

20:22.763 --> 20:25.515
I say that Bates rides with Buttman,
Swan with Coffey.

20:25.599 --> 20:27.851
You say no. Bates gets Swan.

20:27.935 --> 20:30.354
So okay, no arguments from Stach.

20:31.063 --> 20:32.689
But if you've got a bigger
problem, Sergeant...

20:35.025 --> 20:37.444
Yeah, well, I don't like
your attitude towards women.

20:39.404 --> 20:43.825
Referencing the fact that in self-defense,
I gave Lieutenant Vera Horvath a shot.

20:43.909 --> 20:46.745
That's what I like.
That's what I like, Sergeant.

20:48.497 --> 20:50.707
Two seconds ago, you were
about to duke it out with a guy.

20:50.791 --> 20:51.875
What about the guy?

20:52.542 --> 20:55.337
If you'd gone, what's he supposed to do,
keep his hands tied up like this?

20:55.420 --> 20:57.839
-Of course not!
-There! Good! You said it!

20:57.923 --> 20:58.840
-WOMAN: Hey, Sarge?
-What?

20:59.466 --> 21:01.134
Guys are using the ladies room, Sarge.

21:02.135 --> 21:03.011
That's it.

21:03.637 --> 21:05.389
That's it. Rhonda Kimmel, that's it.

21:08.600 --> 21:12.062
-See? We're both sergeants.
-Mm-hmm.

21:12.938 --> 21:14.523
We gotta be fair with each other.

21:16.984 --> 21:18.527
(chattering)

21:19.528 --> 21:22.364
This is Henry to Rachel's
answering machine.

21:23.323 --> 21:26.868
Uh, Rach, the guy who raped you
made bail last night.

21:27.327 --> 21:28.912
His girlfriend's dead this morning.

21:29.538 --> 21:32.207
Nice going. I guess that's
some kind of civics lesson.

21:35.419 --> 21:36.378
(telephone thuds)

21:38.755 --> 21:42.092
Okay Ms. Kimmel,
this is what you're forcing me to do here.

21:42.634 --> 21:44.344
-RHONDA: What?
-What?

21:45.178 --> 21:46.263
What do you think?

21:47.055 --> 21:49.599
-Man's got functions, Ms. Kimmel.
-(zipper opens)

21:53.562 --> 21:55.814
Believe me, Ms. Kimmel,
this embarrasses me

21:55.897 --> 21:57.816
as much as it embarrasses you.

21:58.650 --> 21:59.609
Uh, Stan...

22:01.403 --> 22:03.405
Go ahead. Urinate.

22:05.365 --> 22:06.825
-Ah!
-(zips fly)

22:09.494 --> 22:11.872
This woman's got a lot of stones, Captain.

22:12.622 --> 22:13.707
Pardon the metaphor.

22:15.417 --> 22:16.626
(sighs) Rhonda,

22:17.169 --> 22:19.671
-just listen to me--
-Tell the woman anything, right?

22:19.755 --> 22:22.758
Tell her she's beautiful.
Tell her she's 25 years old.

22:22.841 --> 22:25.677
-Rhonda--
-I don't have a slim waist.

22:25.886 --> 22:28.013
You think I don't know that?

22:28.096 --> 22:29.056
Frank?

22:30.515 --> 22:31.391
What?

22:31.641 --> 22:32.809
I just thought maybe I could help.

22:32.893 --> 22:34.436
-Absolutely not.
-(sighs)

22:34.519 --> 22:36.730
You're not a cop.
This isn't any of your business.

22:36.813 --> 22:38.523
Okay, okay.

22:39.566 --> 22:41.401
You know there are no urinals
in this men's room?

22:41.485 --> 22:44.112
-RHONDA: Who's that, the victim lady?
-Yes, it is.

22:44.196 --> 22:46.239
-Well, I'm a victim!
-(slapping stall)

22:46.907 --> 22:49.326
Well, don't look at me
like I'm a co-conspirator or something.

22:49.409 --> 22:53.121
I just happened to spend ten minutes
talking to her this morning.

22:53.205 --> 22:54.831
Can any of the rest of you say that?

22:55.248 --> 22:57.459
RHONDA: I want to talk to the victim lady.

22:58.001 --> 22:59.086
Alone.

22:59.753 --> 23:01.254
Come on, is that possible?

23:01.797 --> 23:04.132
I mean, you all have
better things to do, don't you?

23:08.804 --> 23:10.514
Okay, but make sure she understands,

23:10.597 --> 23:13.600
if she comes out now,
we can still forgive and forget.

23:16.853 --> 23:17.729
Rhonda?

23:18.355 --> 23:21.525
MICK: Free soft drink with this coupon.
All aboard.

23:21.608 --> 23:24.069
I have a coupon for a free drink.

23:24.152 --> 23:26.196
I told you...

23:26.279 --> 23:28.615
to get away from here!

23:29.241 --> 23:30.784
All of you!

23:31.118 --> 23:34.621
Great! Great. Some lure I got here.

23:34.704 --> 23:37.249
-The guy was in my way.
-Let me ask you something.

23:37.332 --> 23:39.751
-Whose relative are you?
-What?

23:39.835 --> 23:41.586
You gotta be somebody's relative.

23:41.670 --> 23:42.754
Since you've been here,

23:42.838 --> 23:46.341
I've had the worst hour
of customer traffic in my history.

23:46.425 --> 23:48.552
-You kneecapped two kids--
-They we're pulling my feathers.

23:48.635 --> 23:50.971
You growl at workmen coming in for coffee

23:51.054 --> 23:54.349
and when I call downtown
to speak to Uncle Fryer personally,

23:54.433 --> 23:57.394
begging him let me fire this nut
before I go broke,

23:57.644 --> 23:59.104
-he says no.
-Listen to me, mister--

23:59.187 --> 24:00.981
No, you listen to me, mister.

24:01.064 --> 24:04.109
from now no more talk,
no growling, just this...

24:04.192 --> 24:07.362
(mimics chicken clucking)

24:11.408 --> 24:13.952
-(alarm bell clanging)
-Stop him! Robber!

24:14.035 --> 24:16.872
-Hey, somebody call the cops!
-MICK: I am a cop!

24:18.248 --> 24:19.749
(people yelling)

24:51.531 --> 24:53.283
(growls)

24:53.575 --> 24:55.243
You have a choice, armpit!

24:55.744 --> 24:59.164
I can either bust you or I can kill you!

24:59.915 --> 25:01.249
(growls)

25:10.759 --> 25:13.303
NEAL: Yeah. Right, soon as I can.

25:13.678 --> 25:15.514
-Thanks.
-(cradles phone)

25:15.597 --> 25:17.349
-(knocks on glass)
-HENRY: What you got?

25:17.432 --> 25:18.725
NEAL: Wait for the Captain.

25:19.935 --> 25:21.478
Got a tip on Fitzsimmons, Captain.

25:21.561 --> 25:23.647
He's checked into a boarding house
on 117th Street.

25:23.730 --> 25:25.315
-Arrest warrant?
-Just calling for it.

25:25.398 --> 25:29.903
-Briscoe, line four.
-Washington. Mm-hm.

25:30.278 --> 25:31.154
FRANK: Furillo.

25:32.239 --> 25:34.699
-I don't like it either, Chief.
-(loud crash)

25:34.783 --> 25:36.284
His options were limited.

25:38.954 --> 25:42.457
FRANK: No. All right, there was
no way to hold Fitzsimmons.

25:44.918 --> 25:45.961
Sit!

25:50.131 --> 25:52.133
(chair rumbles)

26:01.226 --> 26:02.143
Name.

26:06.481 --> 26:09.526
Name, hairball, or I'll rip
your lungs out through your nose.

26:09.609 --> 26:12.028
(mouths)

26:13.905 --> 26:16.283
Oh, are you, uh, deaf?

26:20.328 --> 26:23.331
(falsetto voice) He's not deaf.
He wants his lawyer. Ha-ha!

26:26.626 --> 26:28.044
(growls)

26:31.131 --> 26:32.757
(typewriter clacking)

26:33.967 --> 26:34.968
Ready?

26:35.552 --> 26:38.138
Yeah, one second. Just let me...

26:38.930 --> 26:41.224
(typewriter clacking)

26:42.934 --> 26:44.728
Done. Got a minute?

26:44.811 --> 26:45.895
Sure, what's up?

26:47.063 --> 26:48.481
Well, um...

26:50.275 --> 26:52.611
I... I just thought I'd ask,

26:52.694 --> 26:54.362
but you seemed a little
nervous out there this morning.

26:55.822 --> 26:57.032
(stammers) What do you mean?

26:57.657 --> 26:59.492
You know, with the cuffs, and, uh...

27:00.285 --> 27:01.244
You feel better now?

27:04.623 --> 27:07.125
Larry, maybe I'm way out of line,
but you gotta tell me.

27:07.208 --> 27:10.503
I mean, uh, can I ask you
about your stammer?

27:13.423 --> 27:16.718
(stammers) It's a lot better
than it used to be.

27:18.136 --> 27:19.346
You're seeing a therapist?

27:19.804 --> 27:23.850
I used to, but it only
comes out now under stress.

27:25.018 --> 27:26.895
And this is stress.

27:30.982 --> 27:33.026
It's only because you brought it up.

27:36.363 --> 27:38.740
Why, you think I'm not right to be a cop?

27:40.283 --> 27:42.994
The Academy passed me.
They th-thought it was okay.

27:44.704 --> 27:47.040
Yeah, well, we're gonna be late for court,

27:47.123 --> 27:49.918
and it's probably none
of my business, anyway.

27:50.001 --> 27:53.421
Hey, (stammers) I'm glad
I pulled the Hill.

27:54.464 --> 27:57.175
Gives me a chance to work this thing out.

27:57.717 --> 27:59.803
(telephone ringing)

27:59.886 --> 28:02.097
Captain, DA said make the deal
with the cable install

28:02.180 --> 28:04.891
-and investigate the names he gives us.
-Are you on it?

28:04.974 --> 28:07.268
Yeah, Mr. Cornell gave us
a three-page list.

28:07.352 --> 28:09.062
There's one particular name here.

28:12.107 --> 28:13.233
You're kidding.

28:13.316 --> 28:15.735
Cornell's a B&amp;E guy.
He knows a lot of lawyers.

28:16.945 --> 28:17.779
Harry?

28:19.656 --> 28:22.701
I have a theft of services
suspect I'd like you to bring in.

28:22.784 --> 28:26.037
STAN: Bingo, well, there's a bingo.

28:26.121 --> 28:28.832
-Feeling better now, are we?
-Yeah, she's okay.

28:28.915 --> 28:32.794
Frank. All she wants is just
once in a while, you know,

28:32.877 --> 28:35.505
somebody of rank to say
good morning to her,

28:35.588 --> 28:38.049
or to ask her about her work
without criticizing her.

28:38.133 --> 28:39.718
You know, that's all she wants.

28:40.009 --> 28:41.594
All ready for Fitzsimmons, Captain.

28:44.347 --> 28:47.058
Um, I accept your apology, Lieutenant.

28:51.020 --> 28:52.105
Rhonda.

28:52.814 --> 28:54.816
You know, they're very busy men.

28:55.150 --> 28:58.236
MICK: You can't run an undercover
with guys clowning around like that.

28:58.319 --> 29:01.448
Are the defendant's assertions true?

29:01.531 --> 29:03.241
Your Honor,
he was obstructing all morning.

29:03.324 --> 29:06.453
By which, you mean, he was
expressing himself artistically.

29:06.536 --> 29:08.163
No, I mean he was a hump.

29:08.246 --> 29:11.332
-No, no, no, you're the hump, detective.
-What?

29:11.833 --> 29:14.586
-No, what the hell does that mean?
-You arrest a man

29:15.044 --> 29:18.506
because you tripped over him
or because you didn't like his face.

29:18.590 --> 29:22.635
You vent your rage at him
because you had to wear a chicken suit.

29:22.719 --> 29:25.180
And you clog the courts with this garbage!

29:26.306 --> 29:28.933
Now, I'd say that makes you
hump of the day, Detective.

29:29.017 --> 29:30.185
(growling)

29:31.186 --> 29:32.187
You're on the verge of contempt.

29:32.270 --> 29:34.230
-No, you're a joke!
-(gavel thuds)

29:36.024 --> 29:39.736
I cite you, Detective.
Give him ten minutes to put a muzzle on.

29:48.578 --> 29:51.080
-(door opens, closes)
-A street artiste.

29:51.664 --> 29:53.291
Well, I think that's sweet.

29:54.751 --> 29:56.169
Norbert, Smith.

30:00.840 --> 30:03.343
Oh. Busted again, huh, man?

30:04.010 --> 30:05.261
MAN: What you got, blood?

30:08.848 --> 30:11.351
Little reefer. You're walking right home.

30:11.434 --> 30:12.727
Well, look, I want you to do me a favor.

30:13.311 --> 30:15.605
Remember thing I was talking to you about?

30:15.688 --> 30:17.649
-What thing?
-That thing with Curtis.

30:17.732 --> 30:21.361
-The dude you offed?
-Yeah, the dude I offed.

30:21.444 --> 30:22.278
Curtis!

30:22.362 --> 30:24.197
Hey, I want you to shut up
about that, Lane.

30:24.280 --> 30:28.076
Just listen, I'm telling you.
The piece is under my bed.

30:28.827 --> 30:30.995
-What you want from me?
-I want you to lose it.

30:31.746 --> 30:34.666
PD say I got 20 days, so lose it.

30:35.124 --> 30:36.417
Understand, brother man?

30:37.752 --> 30:38.795
Okay, you got it.

30:39.170 --> 30:41.130
-(door opens)
-MAN: Rufus Gordon.

30:42.090 --> 30:45.134
-MAN 1: I was here before he was.
-MAN 2: Hey, man, what about us?

30:48.263 --> 30:49.264
Guard.

30:50.223 --> 30:51.140
Guard!

30:54.519 --> 30:56.396
Tell the judge I gotta get out of here.

30:57.605 --> 30:58.439
Now.

31:00.900 --> 31:04.737
More garbage. Does this department
ever nab a serious felon?

31:04.821 --> 31:07.782
Your Honor. Excuse me, could I step up?

31:07.866 --> 31:10.076
As long as you don't lift a leg.

31:10.159 --> 31:11.744
(chuckling)

31:12.871 --> 31:15.456
Your Honor, this dirtbag here, Gordon...

31:16.040 --> 31:19.377
just confessed to a murder
back in the holding pen.

31:19.627 --> 31:21.379
Recess and I'll swear the complaint.

31:21.880 --> 31:23.214
-This guy right here?
-Yeah.

31:24.090 --> 31:25.049
That's not bad.

31:26.551 --> 31:28.011
Recess, 15 minutes.

31:28.094 --> 31:29.095
(gavel bangs)

31:31.097 --> 31:31.931
JUDGE: Belker.

31:34.142 --> 31:35.727
Sorry about our tiff before.

31:37.228 --> 31:38.980
But let's ask ourselves, Detective.

31:39.689 --> 31:42.692
Could it have been some weird
prescience on my part

31:42.775 --> 31:44.235
that turned us up a biggie?

31:50.700 --> 31:53.536
-Excuse me, Ms. Davenport?
-Yes, Detective?

31:53.620 --> 31:55.079
Yeah, don't kill the messenger, okay?

31:55.163 --> 31:58.583
But I have a warrant here for you
for a theft of services.

31:59.959 --> 32:00.793
What is this?

32:00.877 --> 32:02.545
Look, as soon as the arraignment's done,

32:02.629 --> 32:04.547
would you come back
with me to Hill Street?

32:05.548 --> 32:08.843
-Is this some kind of joke?
-No, ma'am, it's Captain Furillo's orders.

32:08.927 --> 32:11.721
He said as soon as your cases were done,
I should bring you back.

32:27.737 --> 32:30.073
Hold it. Hold it, man!

32:30.156 --> 32:32.659
(police siren wailing)

32:46.422 --> 32:48.591
(all yelling)

32:48.675 --> 32:50.551
(screams)

32:56.099 --> 32:58.893
(screaming continues)

33:10.113 --> 33:11.656
Hey, stupid, huh?

33:11.739 --> 33:13.700
You didn't get rid of it,
did you, Fitzsimmons?

33:13.783 --> 33:15.702
(groans) Come on, man, what are you doing?

33:15.785 --> 33:17.787
You're under arrest, man,
for the murder of Marsha Stanley!

33:17.870 --> 33:19.455
-Now, read him his rights.
-Leave me alone!

33:19.539 --> 33:20.623
Shut up!

33:20.707 --> 33:22.667
You have the right to remain silent...

33:22.750 --> 33:24.669
-If you give up that right...
-(groaning loudly)

33:24.752 --> 33:27.714
...it can and will be held
against you in a court of law.

33:27.797 --> 33:31.384
That was self-defense.
Of all the crap I expect...

33:32.552 --> 33:34.721
-Just leave me alone!
-Okay, move him out.

33:35.930 --> 33:37.515
(phones ringing)

33:37.598 --> 33:39.392
-Hi.
-Hey.

33:40.059 --> 33:41.644
You get the Grateful Bladder Award.

33:41.728 --> 33:43.104
Excuse me. Thanks, Leo.

33:43.187 --> 33:46.899
-Getting Rhonda Kimmel out of the john.
-Well, I am the victims' aide, Henry.

33:46.983 --> 33:48.651
-Rachel.
-Hi.

33:48.735 --> 33:51.320
-Mrs. Goldblume.
-Mrs. Ferrar.

33:51.612 --> 33:52.739
What's in a name, right?

33:52.822 --> 33:54.574
-Excuse us a minute, Fay?
-Sure.

33:55.324 --> 33:57.827
You have a hell of a nerve leaving
that message on my machine!

33:57.910 --> 33:59.162
-A woman is dead.
-(Renko yells)

33:59.245 --> 34:00.246
Let's not talk about anybody's nerve.

34:00.329 --> 34:04.042
What if your son had come home from school
and clicked on that machine before I did?

34:06.335 --> 34:08.629
Rachel. Rachel, look at me.

34:08.713 --> 34:10.048
Rachel. Rachel!

34:11.966 --> 34:14.343
He looked right at me.
He didn't even know who I was.

34:14.427 --> 34:17.263
-Okay, okay, okay. Leo?
-Bastard.

34:17.555 --> 34:20.016
-Could I get an interrogation room?
-Sorry, Lieutenant.

34:27.482 --> 34:29.358
(panting)

34:30.860 --> 34:31.736
You okay?

34:36.282 --> 34:37.116
Listen...

34:39.702 --> 34:41.037
I know it's too late,

34:41.412 --> 34:43.581
but if signing a complaint
will keep him off the streets--

34:43.664 --> 34:44.832
It's not necessary.

34:44.916 --> 34:47.043
(inhales)
We should have him cold on murder.

34:50.630 --> 34:51.964
I feel responsible.

34:54.801 --> 34:58.471
-I never felt more rotten in my life.
-What good's that gonna do you?

35:00.765 --> 35:02.350
I let him kill someone.

35:02.433 --> 35:04.560
You said that was gonna happen
and that's what happened.

35:04.644 --> 35:05.478
Listen...

35:07.396 --> 35:09.941
The guy walked this morning
mostly 'cause of how I arrested him.

35:12.235 --> 35:13.444
You were attacked.

35:13.820 --> 35:17.073
What you did afterward was trying
to protect yourself. And our kids.

35:18.074 --> 35:19.492
Please forgive yourself.

35:22.870 --> 35:25.873
(exhales) And forgive me.
I'm making it harder for you.

35:27.375 --> 35:29.043
Come on. Let's go home.

35:29.335 --> 35:31.003
There's nothing for you to do here.

35:32.421 --> 35:36.008
-Go on. I'll try to see the kids later.
-Okay, we're counting on it.

35:38.219 --> 35:39.137
Six o'clock.

35:42.682 --> 35:43.724
I'm gonna try.

36:00.199 --> 36:01.284
(doorbell rings)

36:01.826 --> 36:02.660
(door opens)

36:04.036 --> 36:04.871
Thanks.

36:10.209 --> 36:12.962
-Hi.
-Oh, hi.

36:13.754 --> 36:14.964
Hi, I, uh...

36:15.298 --> 36:18.301
-I, uh, brought the, uh, the photos.
-Please.

36:22.638 --> 36:23.472
Thank you.

36:25.183 --> 36:28.978
-Oh, this is really great of you.
-What?

36:30.396 --> 36:34.233
-Oh, you mean to come over.
-To give this so much attention.

36:34.734 --> 36:36.736
Let's face it, I do have insurance.

36:36.819 --> 36:38.988
Hey, insurance doesn't
cover the time you're out.

36:39.530 --> 36:40.531
No, you're right.

36:40.615 --> 36:43.075
Insurance doesn't cover
the sense of violation, either.

36:43.159 --> 36:45.286
That's true. Thank you.

36:48.456 --> 36:51.417
-Hmm.
-You, uh, see anybody?

36:51.959 --> 36:53.669
Oh, gosh, he was pretty far away.

36:53.753 --> 36:57.465
I don't think I could recognize
anything off of a photo.

36:58.216 --> 36:59.133
Sorry.

36:59.759 --> 37:02.637
Hey... just keep trying.

37:04.305 --> 37:06.390
-Could we keep trying over dinner?
-Dinner. Din--

37:06.849 --> 37:08.392
Yeah, sure dinner.

37:08.768 --> 37:10.478
(telephone ringing)

37:10.895 --> 37:13.773
-You want to see me captain?
-Yeah, come on in.

37:17.026 --> 37:18.361
Close the door, would you?

37:26.244 --> 37:29.747
-Word gets out fast, Officer Buttman.
-About what, sir?

37:30.456 --> 37:33.292
About how many feathers you managed
to ruffle your first day on the job.

37:34.919 --> 37:36.629
I was just trying to fit in, Captain.

37:37.380 --> 37:40.633
You know, someday you might need
one of those uniforms to save your life.

37:41.133 --> 37:42.969
Might be wise to stay on their good side.

37:45.763 --> 37:47.181
I guess until people get to know me,

37:47.265 --> 37:49.392
they don't always
appreciate my sense of humor.

37:50.476 --> 37:51.310
Uh-huh.

37:52.937 --> 37:54.021
When I was a rookie,

37:54.480 --> 37:55.982
we always figured the best way to fit in

37:56.065 --> 37:58.234
was to keep our mouths shut
and do our jobs.

38:00.861 --> 38:03.114
Well, maybe I ought
to be fitted for a muzzle or something.

38:03.197 --> 38:04.949
Might be a good idea, starting right now.

38:05.032 --> 38:07.410
Unless you have something
clever to say to that, too.

38:08.661 --> 38:12.290
-Can't think of a thing, Captain.
-That's a B. Best answer's, "No, sir."

38:13.291 --> 38:14.125
Yes, sir.

38:21.799 --> 38:23.759
Captain, the aforementioned
suspect's in interrogation

38:23.843 --> 38:25.886
-anytime you're ready.
-Thanks, Harry.

38:29.640 --> 38:33.185
-HENRY: Thirty seconds for me, Frank?
-(sighs) Yeah, 30 seconds.

38:36.647 --> 38:39.150
I want you to know I know
there was more to your conversation

38:39.233 --> 38:41.819
-with the assistant DA this morning.
-What do you mean?

38:42.153 --> 38:45.323
I mean I know he must've recommended
an IAD inquiry

38:45.406 --> 38:46.657
into my arrest of Fitzsimmons.

38:46.741 --> 38:48.159
You must've asked him to pass.

38:48.242 --> 38:50.703
Well, if that's true, Henry,
I must've thought you deserved it.

38:52.371 --> 38:54.790
I mean, the books in your account
didn't just open this morning.

38:54.874 --> 38:58.753
-I want you to know, first I'm grateful--
-No need for gratitude.

38:58.836 --> 39:01.756
And also, I'm gonna
take a little time off.

39:01.839 --> 39:03.758
I got some coming,
I think ought to take it.

39:04.342 --> 39:07.053
If I could have next week,
maybe I can be of some help to Rachel.

39:07.136 --> 39:10.222
Don't. Frank,
really I just wanted to tell you.

39:13.309 --> 39:14.352
(sighs)

39:14.935 --> 39:17.146
I've been cruel these last couple days.

39:17.813 --> 39:19.398
Uh, not these last couple days.

39:22.943 --> 39:23.903
(sighs)

39:24.695 --> 39:27.490
I'm gonna take this time try to figure out
what the hell happened.

39:29.033 --> 39:30.034
Next week's fine.

39:30.951 --> 39:32.453
-Keep me posted.
-Keep you posted.

39:36.582 --> 39:37.666
(door opens)

39:39.794 --> 39:45.007
(clears throat) Uh, Detective,
has Ms. Davenport been Mirandized?

39:45.091 --> 39:47.510
-Yes, sir.
-Thank you.

39:47.593 --> 39:50.971
Oh, I think I'll leave you alone
with the suspect now, sir.

39:56.769 --> 39:58.270
-(door shuts)
-(clears throat)

39:59.146 --> 40:01.065
I can't believe that little creep.

40:01.148 --> 40:02.650
You know, he approached me?

40:02.733 --> 40:05.319
He was somebody's client,
he offered to hook the damn thing up.

40:05.403 --> 40:08.239
Well, counselor,
we're talking Class B misdemeanor here.

40:08.614 --> 40:10.199
Frank, a joke's a joke.

40:10.449 --> 40:14.328
Instructions from the DA's office
are go for a conviction wherever possible.

40:14.745 --> 40:17.623
Garib-- You know Garibaldi
didn't read me my rights.

40:18.457 --> 40:19.417
Have any witnesses?

40:24.463 --> 40:26.715
Maybe you and I could
cut some sort of deal.

40:28.968 --> 40:30.594
I'm a realist. (clears throat)

40:31.679 --> 40:34.306
I know our judiciary's
strained to the limit.

40:37.893 --> 40:38.936
Is that a yes?

40:40.563 --> 40:41.439
What have you got?

40:43.357 --> 40:45.901
It's... mostly in the personal area.

40:45.985 --> 40:47.027
Be specific.

40:47.445 --> 40:49.572
Resumption of conjugal relations.

40:50.322 --> 40:53.075
-Where?
-At home, in bed.

40:53.742 --> 40:54.702
I want a new address.

40:57.163 --> 40:58.122
And what's wrong with the old address?

40:58.205 --> 40:59.915
It was yours. I want one that that's ours.

41:06.005 --> 41:07.798
You're a tough cop, Furillo.

41:10.092 --> 41:11.552
And it's understood...

41:12.887 --> 41:16.182
that if the charges are dropped,
you'll terminate illegal cable hookup

41:16.265 --> 41:17.600
and make restitution.

41:18.809 --> 41:19.643
Okay.

41:19.727 --> 41:22.813
Also, that this arrangement
was not coerced in any way.

41:23.147 --> 41:24.565
Yes to all of it.

41:26.066 --> 41:27.401
(chuckles)

41:29.361 --> 41:31.405
These past four months, I've missed you.

41:32.656 --> 41:33.908
I had to find that out.

41:36.702 --> 41:38.037
Come home, pizza man.

41:53.302 --> 41:57.223
This is, uh, not the kind of place
a guy like me usually gets to.

41:58.724 --> 42:02.019
And you're not the kind of woman a guy
like me usually attracts.

42:02.978 --> 42:04.730
What kind of guy is that?

42:05.523 --> 42:08.067
You know. Cop.

42:09.443 --> 42:11.028
Well, this woman's attracted.

42:14.114 --> 42:15.783
I gotta tell you something, Caroline.

42:16.283 --> 42:18.327
Being a cop, it makes you kind of cynical.

42:18.410 --> 42:20.496
You see so much that's ugly in people.

42:21.705 --> 42:23.582
I guess what I'm trying to say is...

42:24.583 --> 42:27.878
I've had my share of problems
relating to women in the past.

42:29.004 --> 42:31.882
But I get a rush off of you
I haven't felt for a long time.

42:35.344 --> 42:36.971
-John?
-Yeah.

42:37.972 --> 42:39.431
Do you want to take me home now?

42:42.351 --> 42:43.686
(exhales) Do I.

42:45.104 --> 42:46.480
Uh, here. Here, use this.

42:46.564 --> 42:48.274
-Hey. Hey.
-No, hey.

42:49.233 --> 42:50.276
I invited you.

42:51.318 --> 42:52.361
(chuckles)

42:53.153 --> 42:55.447
Soldier wants to re-enlist there, Alfonso.

42:55.531 --> 42:57.449
(laughter)

42:57.533 --> 43:01.704
WOMAN: Let me down!
God, what are you, Tarzan?

43:01.787 --> 43:03.247
You folks meet my fiancée, Lois?

43:03.330 --> 43:04.873
Get outta here, Buttman.

43:06.125 --> 43:10.629
Sorry, we were just looking for the, uh,
(sniffs) lavatory facilities.

43:10.713 --> 43:12.590
It's around the side, right over there.

43:13.465 --> 43:14.800
Side, over there.

43:14.883 --> 43:17.094
Ever tried it around the side, Lois?

43:17.177 --> 43:20.723
-Stop being such a jerk.
-(laughing)

43:21.140 --> 43:22.391
Excuse the interruption.

43:23.892 --> 43:25.894
-Subhuman.
-Take it easy, Luce.

43:25.978 --> 43:28.647
-You take it easy. I'll see you later.
-See you later, Luce.

43:29.064 --> 43:32.192
You know, this kid is really a bad egg.
He's a wrong number.

43:33.402 --> 43:34.653
No proof, fellas.

43:34.737 --> 43:37.156
They went in the back room.
They're supposed to stay in the back room.

43:37.239 --> 43:39.658
That's a private gathering.
It's none of my concern.

43:39.742 --> 43:40.576
Sorry.

43:40.659 --> 43:42.911
This here, I jeopardize my license
and everything else.

43:42.995 --> 43:44.204
Hey, we'll take care of it, Al.

43:44.288 --> 43:46.957
No one's more grateful than me.
You people have my racket.

43:59.470 --> 44:00.304
Yeah?

44:01.597 --> 44:04.350
Hey, brother. What's happening?

44:04.433 --> 44:06.935
Things have gotten a little out
of hand back here, Randy.

44:07.227 --> 44:10.689
Oh, yeah, man, I gave the bartender some
lip when he brought the last round.

44:11.231 --> 44:13.359
Listen, tighten him up for me,
would you, fellas?

44:13.442 --> 44:15.277
-Tell him I'm sorry.
-Put the money away, Buttman.

44:15.361 --> 44:16.487
It's over, man.

44:17.821 --> 44:20.908
Hey, guys. The rookies
rented this room for the evening.

44:20.991 --> 44:23.285
-This is a private party--
-Not anymore.

44:24.119 --> 44:26.622
(chuckles) The hell with the bartender.

44:27.873 --> 44:30.876
You guys aren't interested in seconds?
To hell with you, too.

44:30.959 --> 44:32.294
Hey, you just don't get it,
do you, sucker!

44:32.378 --> 44:33.295
Hey, take it easy!

44:33.379 --> 44:35.714
Now, you shut it down, you hear me?

44:35.798 --> 44:37.800
-Okay!
-BOBBY: You got five minutes, boy.

44:37.883 --> 44:39.510
-Okay.
-And you leave by the back way.

44:39.593 --> 44:41.136
We don't want to see any of it,
you got it?

44:41.220 --> 44:42.554
I got it.

44:48.435 --> 44:51.397
-(loud music playing)
-(laughter)

45:13.669 --> 45:17.423
LARRY (stuttering): Let me go.

45:19.007 --> 45:21.176
(mocking) Are you sure, Larry?

45:21.260 --> 45:23.053
We still got five minutes.

45:24.847 --> 45:26.932
(police siren wailing)

45:33.147 --> 45:34.565
(radio chatter)

45:35.232 --> 45:36.191
Hey, Pats.

45:37.359 --> 45:41.280
Look, uh, I found this
in the dumpster down the alley.

45:41.363 --> 45:42.865
There's no cash, there's no credit--

45:42.948 --> 45:44.992
-Wait, don't smudge it.
-I won't.

45:47.411 --> 45:49.288
Warren C. Reynolds.

45:51.540 --> 45:53.167
(phone ringing)

45:54.376 --> 45:55.210
Uh, hello?

45:56.462 --> 45:57.671
Yes, this is she.

46:00.924 --> 46:02.009
Oh, my God.

46:04.011 --> 46:07.097
Yes. Of course, I'll be over right away.

46:08.307 --> 46:10.684
-Thank you.
-Hey. Hey.

46:10.976 --> 46:11.852
What's the matter?

46:13.437 --> 46:16.940
I, uh, just got some horrible news.

46:18.192 --> 46:19.985
My husband's been murdered.

46:35.959 --> 46:36.960
(door opens, closes)

46:37.294 --> 46:39.338
In the horrible news category,

46:40.756 --> 46:42.424
I didn't know you had a husband.

47:03.946 --> 47:04.863
(sighs)

47:06.323 --> 47:08.575
-I'm nervous.
-Why?

47:08.659 --> 47:09.660
I don't know.

47:10.327 --> 47:11.537
It's been a long time.

47:21.547 --> 47:22.714
It's like riding a bike.

47:24.132 --> 47:26.260
Just climb on and start pedaling.

47:26.343 --> 47:27.761
(laughs)

47:40.023 --> 47:41.650
Thanks for waiting, pizza man.

47:43.277 --> 47:44.695
Thanks for being so patient.

47:47.573 --> 47:49.157
Patience just ran out.

47:50.367 --> 47:51.618
I call that perfect timing.

48:03.213 --> 48:05.591
(closing theme playing)
