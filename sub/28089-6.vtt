<i>Previously on
Doom Patrol...</i>

00:22.121 --> 00:23.257
Who wants pancakes?

00:23.289 --> 00:26.126
Cliff!

00:26.161 --> 00:28.528
<i>You told me
my daughter was dead!</i>

00:28.562 --> 00:30.931
- I was trying to protect you.
- By lying?

00:30.964 --> 00:33.466
Paraguay was an eye-opener.
All that carnage.

00:33.500 --> 00:34.902
Cliff,
you're a fucking monster.

00:34.936 --> 00:36.804
It's not your fault, Elliot.

00:36.838 --> 00:38.273
You should've let me die.

00:38.305 --> 00:43.305
I went with my gut,
and my gut says you deserve a break.

00:47.048 --> 00:48.883
- Shit! Shit.
- What is that?

00:48.915 --> 00:50.750
Don't! No, it's an
emergency trigger!

00:50.784 --> 00:52.020
- No, no, no. Don't!
- What?

00:52.052 --> 00:54.253
- If you press it, my dad...
- It'll send an SOS.

00:54.287 --> 00:55.856
This is for your own good.

00:55.890 --> 00:57.991
Grid. Stop, no.

00:58.026 --> 01:00.161
<i>I have one more
task for you.</i>

01:00.195 --> 01:02.627
What the fuck
is the Doom Patrol?

02:50.770 --> 02:51.770
Shit.

03:00.181 --> 03:03.283
Ms. Farr, Mr. Bloom
will see you now.

03:03.318 --> 03:08.318
That only took
an hour and a half.

03:10.824 --> 03:12.659
There she is.

03:12.693 --> 03:14.627
Come here, gorgeous.

03:16.097 --> 03:19.099
Oh. What can my girl get you?
Coffee? Tea?

03:19.133 --> 03:21.669
- Anything at all?
- I'm fine, Sydney. Thank you.

03:21.701 --> 03:24.070
That's all, hon.

03:24.104 --> 03:28.140
Sit.

03:32.445 --> 03:34.748
So, how are you, kiddo?

03:34.782 --> 03:36.518
I'm hungry, Syd.

03:36.550 --> 03:39.219
I want the love-interest role
in your new wrestling picture.

03:39.253 --> 03:41.055
You know I'd be perfect for it.

03:41.088 --> 03:43.223
Boy, you just get right to it,
don't you?

03:43.258 --> 03:46.493
Some girls may need to play
little games. I'm a woman.

03:46.527 --> 03:49.362
I know what I want,
and I'm not afraid to say it.

03:49.395 --> 03:50.431
So I've heard.

03:50.465 --> 03:53.567
Scoop around town is
you're nothing but trouble.

03:53.600 --> 03:55.036
Moody, abusive,

03:55.068 --> 03:58.004
and there's not a makeup girl
in the burg who'll touch you.

03:58.038 --> 04:01.709
Besides, the director has
his heart set on Mary Lacy.

04:01.741 --> 04:05.379
Moon-eyed Mary? Please.

04:05.413 --> 04:08.582
You need a hit bad, Syd,
and I need a job.

04:08.616 --> 04:13.616
So what do you say
we help each other out, hmm?

04:14.122 --> 04:16.322
You wanna talk turkey?

04:16.355 --> 04:17.992
You don't need help.

04:18.024 --> 04:19.927
What you need is a miracle.

04:19.961 --> 04:24.732
Because the name "Rita Farr" hasn't
put a butt in the seat in a dog's age.

04:24.764 --> 04:28.134
Concrete shines brighter
than your star...

04:28.168 --> 04:29.517
My sweet.

04:36.509 --> 04:37.509
Hmm.

04:51.458 --> 04:52.958
Atta girl.

05:00.134 --> 05:03.437
Show me how hungry you are.

05:03.470 --> 05:06.238
Hmm.

05:40.940 --> 05:44.644
Syd?

05:44.677 --> 05:45.677
Syd?

05:53.487 --> 05:57.190
Uh...

05:57.225 --> 06:01.425
Mr. Bloom?

06:06.067 --> 06:10.716
The bastard had a heart attack.

06:14.742 --> 06:16.776
You were never here.

06:16.810 --> 06:20.480
Get it? Go.

06:34.694 --> 06:39.345
I don't think he's coming back.

07:04.860 --> 07:09.797
"This user's profile
is only viewable by friends."

07:09.829 --> 07:12.098
What about her fucking father?

07:29.050 --> 07:30.584
Jane?

07:30.617 --> 07:35.617
I made you some, "We kicked
the apocalypse's ass" sandwiches.

07:36.689 --> 07:37.759
Hi.

07:37.791 --> 07:39.793
I was wondering, if you're
not busy or anything...

07:39.827 --> 07:43.297
I'm trying to look at my kid's
online thing, and...

07:43.297 --> 07:46.100
I could use some help.

07:46.132 --> 07:50.737
I made 'em just the way
Baby Doll likes...

07:52.105 --> 07:56.009
Does that mean you're still
mad at me?

07:56.043 --> 07:58.144
Hello?

07:58.178 --> 08:00.947
I'm not cleaning this shit up.

08:00.980 --> 08:02.149
Fine, I'll do it!

08:02.182 --> 08:04.918
But just this fucking once.
You hear me, Jane?

08:04.951 --> 08:06.586
Jane!

08:06.620 --> 08:08.988
Fuck!

08:09.023 --> 08:11.125
<i>No!</i>

08:11.158 --> 08:16.129
<i>No! N-O. N-O.
I don't want you to go.</i>

08:16.163 --> 08:18.399
<i>It's only for
a few days, Baby Doll.</i>

08:18.432 --> 08:20.100
<i>It's seven.</i>

08:20.134 --> 08:23.137
Seven is a whole week!

08:23.170 --> 08:24.971
You'll miss pancake day.

08:25.004 --> 08:27.574
But what if...

08:27.608 --> 08:32.578
I promise to have pancakes
at 9:00 a.m. tomorrow,

08:32.613 --> 08:35.014
and think of you.

08:35.048 --> 08:37.750
And you have pancakes
at the same time

08:37.784 --> 08:39.620
and think of me, hmm?

08:39.653 --> 08:41.489
No.

08:41.522 --> 08:44.024
No, you're trying to trick me.

08:44.057 --> 08:45.926
It won't be the same.

08:45.960 --> 08:47.461
You're telling me.

08:47.495 --> 08:51.097
For once, I'm going
to be able to enjoy my breakfast without

08:51.131 --> 08:54.302
a certain little piggy...

08:54.335 --> 08:59.005
Snarfing up all the syrup.

08:59.038 --> 09:03.538
Mmm?

09:06.714 --> 09:11.714
<i>But what if you start liking
your new friends more than you like me?</i>

09:12.119 --> 09:13.721
<i>That's impossible.</i>

09:13.754 --> 09:18.057
<i>For one thing, they have
a hopelessly silly name.</i>

09:18.091 --> 09:20.394
<i>"The Doom Patrol."</i>

09:20.427 --> 09:22.697
<i>I mean, really. Come on.</i>

09:22.730 --> 09:27.730
<i>And for another,
they don't like pancakes.</i>

09:38.712 --> 09:41.447
You gonna try and
glue 'em back on?

09:41.480 --> 09:42.982
No need.

09:43.017 --> 09:44.384
Fucking A.

09:44.418 --> 09:46.953
Guess it was a good day
to be a robot boy.

09:46.986 --> 09:51.424
Am I right?

09:51.458 --> 09:54.995
How do I see my kid's
Facehole?

09:55.029 --> 09:59.500
Create a profile, send her a friend request
, and wait for her not to accept it.

09:59.533 --> 10:01.469
I was thinking
you could stick a...

10:01.501 --> 10:04.138
cyber finger in it,
jiggle the handle,

10:04.171 --> 10:05.505
and unlock it for me.

10:05.539 --> 10:07.875
First of all, none of
what you just said makes sense.

10:07.908 --> 10:10.544
And if you're asking me to hack
into it for you... No!

10:10.577 --> 10:13.215
I saved your life, and you can't
do this one lousy thing for me?

10:13.248 --> 10:16.551
Actually, you put me in safety
mode when you pushed my reset button.

10:16.583 --> 10:19.653
And now my cyber fingers won't jiggle
unless my dad turns it off.

10:19.687 --> 10:24.191
You're locked out of your own brain?
That's fucked up.

10:24.225 --> 10:28.328
I thought I was fucked up.

10:28.361 --> 10:31.231
Hey, Siri,
what's the Doom Patrol?

10:31.264 --> 10:33.366
Will you please
stop doing that?

10:33.400 --> 10:36.336
His shit's busted
right now, Jane.

10:36.370 --> 10:38.806
"Doom Patrol"? Never heard of them.
Why do you ask?

10:38.839 --> 10:41.041
Mr. Nobody

10:41.075 --> 10:45.575
kind of asked me to find them.

10:51.552 --> 10:55.121
How come you're helping her
with her thing, but not mine?

10:55.155 --> 10:59.293
Feel free
to take it personally.

10:59.326 --> 11:01.596
Here we go.
Okay, Doom Patrol.

11:01.629 --> 11:05.231
A minor superhero team
active from the early to late '50s.

11:05.265 --> 11:09.135
And then they just...
dropped off the scene.

11:09.169 --> 11:11.739
They're so... smiley.

11:11.773 --> 11:15.775
Look more like a creepy
sex cult than superheroes.

11:15.808 --> 11:17.043
What happened to them?

11:17.076 --> 11:19.046
- Doesn't say.
- Two words...

11:19.046 --> 11:20.615
tracksuits, and Kool-Aid.

11:20.648 --> 11:24.083
Why are you looking
at pictures of the Doom Patrol?

11:24.118 --> 11:25.720
You've heard of them?

11:25.753 --> 11:30.753
If you must know,
I had a brief love affair with Mento.

11:31.557 --> 11:33.759
Mento.

11:33.793 --> 11:35.864
Steve Dayton?

11:35.897 --> 11:38.865
The fifth richest man
in America...

11:38.899 --> 11:40.600
in 1955.

11:40.634 --> 11:43.437
The guy with the salad spinner
on his head?

11:43.471 --> 11:45.339
It's a psionic amplifier.

11:45.373 --> 11:48.442
It enhances his natural
psychic abilities.

11:48.475 --> 11:51.345
Our liaison ended poorly
and I don't wish to speak of it.

11:51.379 --> 11:53.447
No one cares. Start talking.

11:53.480 --> 11:54.682
Well, I never met the others.

11:54.716 --> 11:57.017
Niles only introduced me
to Steve.

11:57.017 --> 11:58.284
How did Niles know him?

11:58.318 --> 11:59.620
I have no idea.

11:59.653 --> 12:04.653
Did you ever ask this dude
anything about himself?

12:05.225 --> 12:06.727
Anything at all?

12:06.760 --> 12:08.996
It was a very introspective
time in my life.

12:09.029 --> 12:13.801
Do you have any idea why Mr. Nobody would
point us inthe direction of Doom Patrol?

12:13.835 --> 12:16.102
Mr. Nobody wants you
to find them.

12:16.135 --> 12:17.238
And you're doing it.

12:17.270 --> 12:18.806
You got a problem with that?

12:18.840 --> 12:22.576
What, with you doing precisely
what the bad guy told you to do?

12:22.610 --> 12:25.145
No. Why would we have
a problem with that?

12:25.179 --> 12:28.048
I didn't hear you complaining
when he helped us stop the Decreator.

12:28.082 --> 12:31.317
By all means, let's t
rust the degenerate who kidnapped Niles

12:31.351 --> 12:33.788
and shoved an entire town
up a donkey's ass.

12:33.821 --> 12:37.357
Yeah. Unfortunately,
I don't give a fuck what you think.

12:37.390 --> 12:39.793
We're got nothing else to go on
right now.

12:39.826 --> 12:41.629
You're my in
and you're my backup.

12:41.662 --> 12:46.662
So shut your assholes
because we're doing this.

12:49.803 --> 12:52.706
Please, God, don't let me
puke in my bandages.

12:52.739 --> 12:53.974
What?

12:54.006 --> 12:57.307
- Where...
- We're here.

13:04.317 --> 13:06.821
Jane, I want no part
of this nonsense.

13:06.854 --> 13:08.989
Have Flit take me back
this instant.

13:09.022 --> 13:10.823
Hang on, let me tell her.

13:10.856 --> 13:12.059
Uh-huh? Uh-huh?

13:12.092 --> 13:14.495
Yeah, Flit says
to fuck yourself in the face.

13:14.495 --> 13:16.429
We're not leaving here
till we find the Doom Patrol.

13:22.903 --> 13:25.539
Hey.

13:25.572 --> 13:30.572
Hey, you guys are...

13:34.914 --> 13:36.051
Trust me,

13:36.083 --> 13:38.253
when I tell you ladies
you do not wanna fuck with me.

13:38.285 --> 13:43.285
Remember, it's always better
to subdue your opponent if you can.

13:43.725 --> 13:47.193
What is this shit?
A fucked-up <i>Rushmore?</i>

13:50.597 --> 13:55.269
Deadly force should be
your last resort.

13:57.404 --> 13:58.806
Okay...

13:58.840 --> 14:02.509
Okay, kids! You guys wanna see
what your teachers look like

14:02.543 --> 14:04.211
on the inside?

14:04.245 --> 14:06.044
Jane.

14:10.918 --> 14:13.587
Where is Niles?

14:13.620 --> 14:17.390
I was just gonna ask you
the same goddamn thing.

14:17.424 --> 14:20.193
Magnificent.

14:20.226 --> 14:21.895
How long did it take?

14:21.929 --> 14:25.633
Didn't think to time it. Sorry.

14:25.666 --> 14:28.269
My arm cannon overheated.

14:28.302 --> 14:31.272
What I wanna know is
why you deployed it in the first place.

14:31.304 --> 14:32.740
To get Niles back.

14:32.774 --> 14:35.308
The man who took him,
Mr. Nobody, he was right here.

14:38.044 --> 14:39.147
I'm sorry, who?

14:39.179 --> 14:42.383
Mr. Nobody. He's a member
of the Brotherhood of Evil.

14:42.416 --> 14:44.152
He's bad news, Pops.

14:44.152 --> 14:45.986
He should be on the JLA
watchlist or something.

14:45.986 --> 14:49.490
The JLA doesn't tend to overlook
the credible threats.

14:49.523 --> 14:53.193
If he mattered,
they'd know him.

14:53.227 --> 14:55.495
You don't care if Niles
lives or dies, do you?

14:55.528 --> 14:56.529
He's your friend.

14:56.563 --> 14:57.999
We haven't been friends
for ages.

14:58.000 --> 14:59.299
So what, that makes him
your enemy?

14:59.299 --> 15:01.068
This is none
of your concern, Vic.

15:01.101 --> 15:05.139
Now, suffice it to say, when you
mix in with weirdos, and pseudo-scientists,

15:05.172 --> 15:07.240
you reap the consequences.

15:07.274 --> 15:08.576
Enough about all that.

15:08.609 --> 15:10.043
We should get started.

15:10.077 --> 15:12.111
How long is this thing
gonna take?

15:12.145 --> 15:14.181
Depending on the damage,

15:14.214 --> 15:16.918
three hours at the most.

15:16.951 --> 15:19.854
- But don't worry, you'll be in sleep mode.
- What?

15:19.886 --> 15:22.456
You won't feel a thing.
It'll be just like taking a nap.

15:22.490 --> 15:24.491
No, no, no.
I gotta be awake for this.

15:24.493 --> 15:25.725
I gotta see how
this thing works.

15:25.725 --> 15:29.797
Victor, do you want me
to reboot you or not?

15:29.831 --> 15:32.365
- How big was that explosion?
- Not very.

15:32.399 --> 15:34.201
Why?

15:34.235 --> 15:37.105
<i>This week's "Stupid Criminal"
spotlight is on Steve Larson,</i>

15:37.138 --> 15:40.073
<i>also known as
Animal Vegetable Mineral Man.</i>

15:40.107 --> 15:43.409
<i>He was attacked by
his secondary dinosaur head</i>

15:43.443 --> 15:45.979
<i>during a robbery gone wrong.</i>

15:46.013 --> 15:48.916
Let's take a look.

15:48.950 --> 15:51.852
Open the register! Now! Now!

15:51.885 --> 15:54.522
Ow! God damn it!

15:54.554 --> 15:56.990
Not the face! Not the face!

15:57.024 --> 16:01.225
Ow! Ow!

16:04.230 --> 16:05.432
What a tit.

16:05.466 --> 16:08.101
<i>Larson was charged with armed robbery.</i>

16:08.135 --> 16:12.373
<i>His dinosaur,
with aiding and a-biting.</i>

16:12.405 --> 16:15.976
What?

16:16.009 --> 16:18.011
Is one of your fucking fingers
inside me?

16:18.046 --> 16:20.447
You really gotta phrase it
that way, huh?

16:20.480 --> 16:22.082
Get the fuck out!

16:22.115 --> 16:25.184
It appears that Niles Caulder's
indestructible man...

16:25.219 --> 16:26.520
Isn't.

16:26.554 --> 16:29.255
I think I have a blowtorch
and some chewin' tobacco in the car.

16:29.288 --> 16:31.057
Fix you right up.

16:33.427 --> 16:38.376
The hell's that
supposed to mean?

16:39.133 --> 16:40.335
Okay, look.

16:40.368 --> 16:42.702
My dad's gonna power me down
when he runs the diagnostics,

16:42.736 --> 16:44.437
you cannot leave me alone
with him.

16:44.471 --> 16:46.039
Why? What's he gonna do?

16:46.073 --> 16:48.176
I don't know. That's the point.

16:48.208 --> 16:52.013
Look, I need you to watch
what he does, and tell me after, okay?

16:52.046 --> 16:53.980
Sure. I can help you out
with that.

16:54.014 --> 16:55.015
Thank you.

16:55.048 --> 16:57.918
But you gotta help me out
with Clara's Facehole.

16:59.687 --> 17:01.355
Please, Cliff.

17:01.388 --> 17:03.490
All right.

17:03.524 --> 17:06.226
Have a nice snooze, buddy.

17:09.430 --> 17:12.098
The Chief started this place?

17:12.098 --> 17:13.067
When?

17:13.067 --> 17:14.902
After the
Doom Patrol retired.

17:14.935 --> 17:16.505
This was their headquarters.

17:16.538 --> 17:20.074
It was Niles' idea to
turn it into a school for meta-humans.

17:20.107 --> 17:24.144
Mento, Rhea, and Arani,
they all agreed to stay on.

17:24.178 --> 17:26.280
As teachers.

17:26.314 --> 17:29.349
How did Niles get involved
with superheroes?

17:29.383 --> 17:30.651
Niles never said.

17:30.684 --> 17:32.920
You know he has his secrets.

17:32.953 --> 17:35.154
You said
your name was Josh Clay.

17:35.189 --> 17:37.257
Have we met before?

17:37.290 --> 17:38.625
No.

17:38.659 --> 17:40.594
I don't believe so.

17:40.627 --> 17:43.329
Were you
in the military?

17:43.364 --> 17:47.433
Briefly.

17:47.468 --> 17:49.804
So Niles kept his shit tight,

17:49.836 --> 17:53.140
- but he told you about me.
- Yeah.

17:53.173 --> 17:56.022
You could say that.

17:58.578 --> 18:00.413
What?

18:00.446 --> 18:02.549
This is your room.

18:02.583 --> 18:04.885
What?

18:04.919 --> 18:08.969
Isn't that why you're here?

18:10.457 --> 18:12.559
Niles didn't send you?

18:12.593 --> 18:13.994
Niles is missing.

18:14.028 --> 18:16.529
"Taken" would be
more accurate.

18:16.564 --> 18:17.798
By who?

18:17.832 --> 18:19.901
Some ass-bag named
Mr. Nobody.

18:19.933 --> 18:23.403
Mr. Nobody?

18:23.436 --> 18:24.637
Who has he taken?

18:24.672 --> 18:27.607
- You know this Nobody freak?
- Jane.

18:27.641 --> 18:29.143
You and I should talk.

18:29.176 --> 18:31.679
Arani, would you mind
showing Larry around?

18:31.711 --> 18:33.580
I don't wanna put anybody out.

18:33.614 --> 18:36.717
No, no, no.
Enjoy the tour, LT.

18:36.750 --> 18:38.851
Take pictures.

19:08.382 --> 19:10.084
The thing about me is,

19:10.117 --> 19:14.288
once I set my mind to a task,
I excel at it.

19:14.321 --> 19:18.159
When I played Jules Niagara
in <i>Three Sabres to Saskatchewan,</i>

19:18.192 --> 19:21.296
I learned the Dance of
the Seven Veils in less than a day.

19:21.328 --> 19:23.663
It's a very complicated number,
Niles.

19:23.663 --> 19:25.299
It is, yes. I've seen it.

19:25.333 --> 19:28.336
So, the fact that I can't
seem to keep

19:28.368 --> 19:32.038
myself together by now
doesn't give me much hope

19:32.073 --> 19:33.575
that a stranger can help me.

19:33.607 --> 19:37.611
Well, I certainly understand
how you feel. And I agree,

19:37.644 --> 19:40.646
you are
an exceptional woman, but...

19:40.647 --> 19:43.182
it's only been a month.

19:43.215 --> 19:44.986
And we are in

19:45.019 --> 19:46.386
uncharted territory.

19:46.421 --> 19:49.089
Do you know how long
a month is in Hollywood?

19:49.123 --> 19:53.094
Every second that passes,
my name gets colder and colder.

19:53.126 --> 19:56.330
If I don't nip this business
in the bud soon,

19:56.364 --> 19:59.901
I may well be stuck here
forever. No offense.

19:59.933 --> 20:02.069
No, this is a safe place.

20:02.103 --> 20:03.337
That is what you make of it.

20:03.371 --> 20:06.340
Isn't there a vitamin shot
I could take instead?

20:06.374 --> 20:09.243
Dr. Kurtz, he will prescribe
you anything you ask for.

20:09.277 --> 20:11.846
Anything at all.
Maybe we should call him.

20:11.878 --> 20:13.548
You and I both know, Rita,

20:13.582 --> 20:17.218
whatever's going on with you
goes deeper than that.

20:17.251 --> 20:19.386
I believe your issue
is as much

20:19.421 --> 20:22.757
psychological,
as it is physiological.

20:22.789 --> 20:24.657
And this...

20:24.692 --> 20:26.294
Mento...

20:26.326 --> 20:31.326
aside from being
fantastically rich, is a doctor?

20:31.365 --> 20:33.867
Not exactly. No.

20:33.901 --> 20:38.772
Ah!

20:38.773 --> 20:40.039
- Am I late?
- No.

20:40.040 --> 20:41.808
Right on time. Steve Dayton,

20:41.842 --> 20:43.544
I'd like you to meet
Rita Farr.

20:43.576 --> 20:45.980
It's a pleasure, Ms. Farr.

20:46.012 --> 20:49.750
Niles, I don't think
I'm comfortable with this.

20:49.785 --> 20:54.188
This may be hard to believe,
but when Niles first found me,

20:54.221 --> 20:56.723
I looked like the creature
from your last film.

20:56.757 --> 20:58.558
After Mick Manly
had killed him.

20:58.592 --> 20:59.926
You're familiar with my work?

20:59.961 --> 21:01.327
Who isn't?

21:01.361 --> 21:04.265
You're... Rita Farr.

21:04.298 --> 21:06.866
It would be my privilege
to work with you.

21:06.901 --> 21:11.538
And what is it that
we'd be doing exactly?

21:11.571 --> 21:14.040
Learning to, uh...

21:14.075 --> 21:15.442
quiet the mind.

21:15.477 --> 21:18.846
Mento has extraordinary
psychic abilities.

21:18.880 --> 21:23.880
He can teach you
how to transcend the emotional obstacles

21:24.085 --> 21:28.122
that are preventing you
from reshaping yourself.

21:28.155 --> 21:30.357
That's your game,
you read minds?

21:30.391 --> 21:34.894
I have a few other tricks
up my sleeve, but, yes,

21:34.929 --> 21:37.463
I can read minds.

21:37.498 --> 21:39.066
Well...

21:39.099 --> 21:42.503
I'm sorry to have wasted
your time, Mr. Dayton,

21:42.537 --> 21:47.537
but I don't care to have some
stranger gawking at my private thoughts.

21:47.807 --> 21:49.710
As tempting
as that might be,

21:49.742 --> 21:52.046
I give you my word
as a gentleman,

21:52.078 --> 21:55.048
that I will not gawk
at anything of yours

21:55.082 --> 21:58.585
without permission.

21:58.618 --> 22:01.288
Starting now.

22:01.320 --> 22:03.124
See?

22:03.156 --> 22:05.856
Not a single peek.

22:15.736 --> 22:18.939
<i>Rita?</i>

22:18.972 --> 22:22.241
My God, it is you.

22:22.242 --> 22:23.108
Steven.

22:23.109 --> 22:25.479
What on earth
are you doing here?

22:25.511 --> 22:26.646
I wish I knew.

22:26.680 --> 22:27.914
You look fantastic.

22:27.948 --> 22:29.950
Oh, please. I'm a mess.

22:29.983 --> 22:32.286
Not on your worst day, doll.

22:32.319 --> 22:35.122
You always were
a smooth talker.

22:35.155 --> 22:37.258
It helped hide
what a judgmental oaf you were.

22:37.290 --> 22:39.359
I certainly had you fooled
for a while.

22:39.394 --> 22:43.163
I was at a low point. Besides,
that was then. I've moved on.

22:43.196 --> 22:45.699
So, there's no harm in us
getting a drink together?

22:45.732 --> 22:47.501
Only to your liver.

22:47.535 --> 22:50.436
Which I pray dies
a slow, mournful death.

22:54.642 --> 22:57.211
I don't know why
Mr. Nobody sent you here,

22:57.244 --> 22:59.980
and I'm sorry to hear
about Niles, but, um...

23:00.013 --> 23:01.281
I'm afraid we can't help you.

23:01.315 --> 23:04.151
Well, that's not a very
super-heroic thing to say.

23:04.184 --> 23:05.652
I'm not a superhero.

23:05.685 --> 23:06.854
I'm an administrator.

23:06.886 --> 23:10.990
And you and your friends
have to leave.

23:14.429 --> 23:16.696
Was I supposed to be
a student or a teacher?

23:16.730 --> 23:17.865
Pardon?

23:17.898 --> 23:20.134
Well, Niles was shipping
me here for a reason, right?

23:20.167 --> 23:22.403
We had a few preliminary
conversations,

23:22.436 --> 23:24.739
but, uh, he wasn't very forthcoming.

23:24.772 --> 23:27.709
Why'd you fob Larry off
to ol' fire fingers back there?

23:27.709 --> 23:29.809
Like you didn't want me
to ask her about Mr. Nobody?

23:29.844 --> 23:30.978
That's none of your concern.

23:31.011 --> 23:32.880
I have a room here.

23:32.913 --> 23:35.817
Maybe it should be.

23:35.851 --> 23:39.787
Perhaps when you officially
move in, we could revisit the matter.

23:39.819 --> 23:42.790
Yeah, sure. I'll go.

23:42.824 --> 23:47.824
Just as soon as you tell me
everything you know about Mr. Nobody.

23:57.171 --> 24:01.442
These are our extracurricular
classrooms.

24:01.476 --> 24:04.244
Niles believes strongly in
encouraging the creative,

24:04.278 --> 24:09.278
as well as
the meta-human abilities.

24:11.951 --> 24:14.655
You don't talk much, do you?

24:14.689 --> 24:19.689
Forgive me, but to be perfectly honest,
I didn't wanna come here.

24:20.228 --> 24:21.761
What was that?

24:21.795 --> 24:22.796
Did you see that?

24:22.829 --> 24:24.298
Forgive the students.

24:24.332 --> 24:26.467
It's all my husband's fault,
really.

24:26.500 --> 24:29.470
He encourages their
harmless prankery.

24:29.503 --> 24:31.672
Oh, you and Josh
are married?

24:31.704 --> 24:34.075
Goodness, no.

24:34.107 --> 24:37.258
I'm married to Niles.

24:47.355 --> 24:50.557
That's one way
to take the edge off.

24:50.592 --> 24:54.028
Though the venue
leaves something to be desired.

24:54.060 --> 24:55.962
The most secure room
in the building.

24:55.996 --> 25:00.067
Due to all the things
that go boom.

25:00.102 --> 25:04.071
And this is the safest place
to hide hooch from the teenagers.

25:04.105 --> 25:08.241
You can't imagine the hijinks
that these meta-kids can get up to.

25:08.276 --> 25:13.276
Good for them.
You're only young once.

25:14.315 --> 25:16.750
What is this horrid thing?

25:16.784 --> 25:18.684
That...

25:18.719 --> 25:20.854
that belonged to Ultimax.

25:20.887 --> 25:23.523
Leader of
the Brotherhood of Evil.

25:23.557 --> 25:26.027
And unfortunately,
the brain escaped.

25:26.060 --> 25:31.060
But he won't get up to
much mischief without his helm.

25:31.699 --> 25:35.201
These aren't
confiscated weapons, they're trophies.

25:35.236 --> 25:38.338
You brought me here
for one reason, to show off.

25:38.372 --> 25:41.575
Well, isn't that the peahen
calling the peacock proud?

25:41.576 --> 25:45.278
No judgment here.
I'm just surprised...

25:45.313 --> 25:47.682
that you'd still want to
impress me.

25:47.714 --> 25:50.384
Given the way things ended
between us.

25:50.417 --> 25:55.417
Maybe I'd just forgotten
what a head-turner you are.

25:56.324 --> 25:59.160
<i>I was a belly dancer,</i>

25:59.192 --> 26:02.163
<i>an SOE spy,</i>

26:02.195 --> 26:05.932
the queen of Muscle Beach...

26:05.965 --> 26:08.769
I...

26:08.801 --> 26:11.238
I used to be Rita Farr.

26:11.271 --> 26:15.976
Star of stage and screen.

26:16.009 --> 26:18.913
Now I don't know who I am.

26:18.946 --> 26:23.946
A blank slate is the perfect
place for you to start to rebuild yourself.

26:24.519 --> 26:29.519
You just have to decide
who it is you wanna be.

26:32.359 --> 26:35.261
The same person
I've always been...

26:35.296 --> 26:39.566
Rita Farr.

26:39.599 --> 26:41.400
Let's begin.

26:50.243 --> 26:53.381
I want you
to close your eyes.

26:53.413 --> 26:55.015
Take a deep breath.

26:55.048 --> 26:57.218
In.

26:57.250 --> 27:00.054
Then out.

27:00.086 --> 27:01.955
In.

27:01.989 --> 27:06.294
And out.

27:06.326 --> 27:09.626
<i>Now open them.</i>

27:12.932 --> 27:15.836
What's happening?

27:15.868 --> 27:16.938
Mento?

27:16.971 --> 27:21.040
<i>It's all right,
you're perfectly safe.</i>

27:21.075 --> 27:22.875
Where am I?

27:22.910 --> 27:25.846
<i>You are nowhere.</i>

27:25.878 --> 27:28.848
<i>All that exists are you...</i>

27:28.882 --> 27:31.251
<i>and your breath.</i>

27:31.285 --> 27:34.188
<i>Breathe in...</i>

27:34.221 --> 27:37.825
<i>...then out.</i>

27:37.857 --> 27:39.058
<i>Good.</i>

27:39.093 --> 27:42.430
<i>Now, repeat after me.</i>

27:42.462 --> 27:47.462
<i>"The person who is breathing
is me."</i>

27:48.836 --> 27:53.273
The person who is breathing
is me.

27:53.307 --> 27:55.343
<i>Again.</i>

27:55.375 --> 28:00.375
The person who is breathing
is me.

28:00.515 --> 28:04.484
The person who is breathing
is me.

28:04.519 --> 28:09.519
The person who is breathing
is me.

28:10.657 --> 28:15.630
The person who is breathing
is me.

28:15.663 --> 28:20.663
The person who is breathing
is me.

28:23.738 --> 28:25.472
This nonsense actually works!

28:25.506 --> 28:30.506
Oh! Good to know
you'll be keeping an open mind.

28:34.749 --> 28:39.749
You probably have strict
psychic-patient rules...

28:41.087 --> 28:44.538
about things like this.

29:00.973 --> 29:02.742
- You're shaking.
- No.

29:02.776 --> 29:04.576
It's just...

29:07.915 --> 29:12.915
What do you think about
wearing the helmet?

29:13.319 --> 29:15.757
Whatever did you have in mind,
Ms. Farr?

29:15.789 --> 29:20.740
I'm not being kinky.

29:22.028 --> 29:25.164
I'm scared, Steve...

29:25.199 --> 29:27.935
of hurting you.

29:27.969 --> 29:31.338
Something terrible happened
once before. If...

29:31.373 --> 29:36.373
you wear the helmet,
you can help me keep control of things.

29:37.545 --> 29:40.513
You are in control of you.

29:40.548 --> 29:43.584
I'll wear the helmet
if you like.

29:43.617 --> 29:47.988
But I know you don't need it.

29:48.020 --> 29:52.292
Wait.

29:52.326 --> 29:55.296
You sure?

29:55.328 --> 29:57.278
Not remotely.

30:07.909 --> 30:11.144
Okay, son,
let's get you rebooted.

30:11.178 --> 30:13.779
You won't feel a thing.

30:13.814 --> 30:15.763
Nighty-night.

30:34.134 --> 30:36.436
All right.

30:36.470 --> 30:38.038
Let's take a look at you.

30:38.073 --> 30:41.942
Looks like none of
your micro-servo units were damaged.

30:41.974 --> 30:43.477
Consider yourself lucky.

30:43.510 --> 30:45.646
You'd need a time machine
to find replacements.

30:45.681 --> 30:50.585
You really think my robo-guts are fucked,
or do you just like shittin' on the Chief?

30:50.617 --> 30:54.622
Well, I don't believe the two
are mutually exclusive.

30:54.654 --> 30:57.557
Niles actually had me consult
on your design.

30:57.592 --> 30:59.992
But then, he refused to take
a single suggestion.

31:00.027 --> 31:01.228
Why?

31:01.261 --> 31:03.064
The man's a dinosaur.

31:03.097 --> 31:07.634
He's terrified of anything that might
threaten to make himor his ideas extinct.

31:07.667 --> 31:09.369
What kind of stuff
would you have done?

31:09.403 --> 31:14.403
Would I be more like
Astro Boy over there?

31:14.508 --> 31:18.010
You would have
been better.

31:24.652 --> 31:26.519
How exactly did this happen?

31:26.554 --> 31:28.355
Vic was scant on the details.

31:28.388 --> 31:30.325
Oh, it was pretty gnarly.

31:30.357 --> 31:33.126
Vic was gonna blast
Mr. Nobody with his hand cannon

31:33.160 --> 31:34.862
and then everything stopped.

31:34.895 --> 31:36.864
Next thing I knew, ka-blam!

31:36.897 --> 31:39.232
Everyone goes fucking flying.

31:39.266 --> 31:40.500
I thought we were dead meat.

31:40.534 --> 31:42.436
Vic? All kinds of fucked up.

31:42.471 --> 31:45.740
He's bleeding.
His hand looked like Elmer Fudd's shotgun

31:45.772 --> 31:50.772
after Bugs Bunny stuck
a cork in it, and then...

31:51.480 --> 31:56.480
I mean, you know, now that I'm really
thinking about it, it wasn't that bad.

31:59.319 --> 32:01.521
He could have been killed.

32:01.555 --> 32:03.657
And for what?

32:03.691 --> 32:05.859
Some puerile teenage rebellion?

32:05.893 --> 32:09.096
Hey, your robo-Boy Scout
bugs the crap out of me,

32:09.130 --> 32:12.799
but even I gotta admit,
what he did yesterday was noble as shit.

32:12.834 --> 32:15.336
He put his ass on the line
to save Chief.

32:15.369 --> 32:18.638
Maybe you should give him a little credit
instead of knocking him down all the time.

32:18.640 --> 32:20.273
What the hell do you know
about being a parent?

32:20.275 --> 32:22.844
Do you really have any idea
what it's like to almost lose a child?

32:22.876 --> 32:26.380
Yeah, I got some idea,
you arrogant fuck-knuckle.

32:26.413 --> 32:28.080
And I got regrets.

32:28.115 --> 32:31.714
What are you gonna have?

32:39.259 --> 32:43.063
It was a small
ceremony, but it was beautiful.

32:43.096 --> 32:45.200
I know it sounds cliche,

32:45.232 --> 32:47.667
but it was the happiest day
of my life.

32:47.701 --> 32:50.305
All my days have been happy
since I met Niles.

32:50.337 --> 32:54.842
Forgive me, but I've
known Niles for almost six decades,

32:54.875 --> 32:58.546
and in all that time,
he's never once mentioned a wife.

32:58.578 --> 33:00.548
Niles and his secrets.

33:00.582 --> 33:03.683
We were married for almost a
year before he told me he had a daughter.

33:03.684 --> 33:04.684
A daughter?

33:04.719 --> 33:07.055
It wasn't until we fought
Mr. Nobody

33:07.087 --> 33:08.722
that he really started
opening up.

33:08.756 --> 33:10.657
<i>You fought Mr. Nobody?</i>

33:10.691 --> 33:12.593
We wiped the floor with him.

33:12.625 --> 33:14.127
Tell me everything.

33:14.162 --> 33:16.998
The Mr. Nobody fight
was the last in the Doom Patrol's career.

33:17.030 --> 33:20.067
Niles brought me in a bit later
to oversee things here.

33:20.101 --> 33:22.702
How it went down exactly...

33:22.737 --> 33:24.672
That depends on who you ask.

33:24.704 --> 33:27.642
<i>It was
Memorial Day weekend,</i>

33:27.674 --> 33:30.478
the park was filled
with families.

33:30.510 --> 33:32.747
That's when Mr. Nobody struck.

33:32.779 --> 33:36.250
At first, it looked like
an ordinary hot-air balloon,

33:36.284 --> 33:39.720
but as it got closer,
people could see that it wasn't.

33:39.753 --> 33:42.423
The balloon was shaped
like a giant...

33:42.455 --> 33:44.491
buttocks.

33:44.525 --> 33:47.193
<i>Instead of a basket
attached to it,</i>

33:47.227 --> 33:48.863
<i>there was a jukebox.</i>

33:48.895 --> 33:51.165
<i>And it played
only one song...</i>

33:51.199 --> 33:55.971
<i>"Hot Diggity" by Perry Como,
and it played it over and over, and over.</i>

33:56.005 --> 34:00.540
<i>Within 20 minutes, everyone
within an earshot went completely insane.</i>

34:02.042 --> 34:03.810
♪ Oh, hot diggity, dog ziggity
<i>Boom what you do to me ♪</i>

34:03.811 --> 34:07.115
<i>♪ It's so new to me What you do to me ♪</i>

34:07.147 --> 34:10.885
<i>♪ Hot diggity, dog ziggity
Boom what you do to me ♪</i>

34:10.918 --> 34:14.322
<i>♪ When you're
Holding me tight ♪</i>

34:14.356 --> 34:19.356
The police arrived first,
but Mr. Nobody was ready for them.

34:20.161 --> 34:22.996
<i>The jukebox was
equipped with a transformer ray</i>

34:23.030 --> 34:28.030
<i>that changed
all the police officers into pinatas.</i>

34:36.478 --> 34:39.414
<i>The crazed crowds
tore them to pieces</i>

34:39.447 --> 34:44.447
<i>and then they ate the candy
from the pinatas.</i>

34:49.422 --> 34:54.422
<i>It was the most
horrible thing that I've ever seen.</i>

35:11.878 --> 35:13.646
<i>When we arrived,</i>

35:13.681 --> 35:15.382
<i>the jukebox split open</i>

35:15.416 --> 35:19.353
and Mr. Nobody leapt out
followed by a hoard of vinyl warriors,

35:19.387 --> 35:22.623
their bodies composed of
long-playing records.

35:22.657 --> 35:26.494
Niles said that Mr. Nobody
was there for him, not us.

35:26.527 --> 35:29.764
<i>And he insisted on being
the tip of our spear.</i>

35:29.797 --> 35:32.465
As the strongest member
of the Doom Patrol,

35:32.498 --> 35:34.768
I led us into the fray.

35:34.802 --> 35:38.606
Rhea and Arani got into
a spot almost immediately.

35:38.639 --> 35:43.445
Luckily, I was there to save them
and destroy Mr. Nobody in one fell swoop.

35:43.478 --> 35:46.681
Mento was so frightened,
he sold his super-suit.

35:46.715 --> 35:50.717
If Niles hadn't been there
to destroy them all, along with Mr. Nobody,

35:50.751 --> 35:52.987
I don't think any of us
would have survived.

35:53.019 --> 35:56.623
Uh-huh. So, Niles
rescued a team of superpeople

35:56.657 --> 35:58.525
from a supervillain?

35:58.559 --> 36:00.961
Without any superpowers?

36:00.994 --> 36:04.364
Why don't you ask him yourself?

36:04.398 --> 36:08.367
- Hello, darling, how was your day?
- Arani, my jewel.

36:08.402 --> 36:09.637
Mmm!

36:09.670 --> 36:13.507
- What a sight for sore eyes.
- Dinner's almost ready.

36:13.539 --> 36:17.139
Fantastic! I'm famished.

36:22.682 --> 36:26.119
How did you escape Mr. Nobody,
Niles?

36:26.152 --> 36:28.923
Mr. Nobody?

36:28.956 --> 36:33.726
Oh, that little devil and his
butt balloon were laid to waste ages ago.

36:33.760 --> 36:37.431
Thanks to my beautiful wife,
that is.

36:37.463 --> 36:40.614
Oh, Niles.

36:49.277 --> 36:52.112
We've got Nobody's balloon
here, somewhere.

36:52.146 --> 36:53.581
It's really
quite a sight to see.

36:53.614 --> 36:56.818
I'm sure it was a terrific
battle, Steven, but...

36:56.851 --> 37:03.255
I'm afraid it was only
the first time Mr. Nobody came after Niles.

37:03.257 --> 37:05.358
He came back.

37:05.391 --> 37:06.693
Impossible.

37:06.726 --> 37:08.028
We KO'd that idiot.

37:08.061 --> 37:10.264
Well, I don't know
what to tell you,

37:10.297 --> 37:13.467
except that he's back,
and he's taken Niles.

37:18.639 --> 37:22.175
- What's happening?
- You're lying.

37:22.210 --> 37:23.945
You couldn't let me
have this, could you?

37:23.978 --> 37:25.813
What on earth
are you going on about?

37:25.846 --> 37:28.416
You came all the way down here
just to ruin me.

37:28.449 --> 37:31.085
Take my wins away,
all the good work that I've done.

37:31.119 --> 37:33.253
- That's not true.
- Please.

37:33.288 --> 37:35.789
We both know
you're capable of anything.

37:43.898 --> 37:45.264
Marybeth?

37:45.298 --> 37:47.135
I didn't say no.

37:47.168 --> 37:52.168
I was too scared
to say anything at all.

37:52.706 --> 37:55.675
Don't!

37:55.708 --> 37:57.811
No!

37:57.844 --> 38:01.347
No. No. No. No.

38:01.380 --> 38:03.184
No. No.

38:03.217 --> 38:07.755
No, no, no, no, no. No.

38:07.788 --> 38:09.556
No. No. No.

38:09.590 --> 38:11.840
No!

38:15.262 --> 38:17.097
What the ever-loving fuck?

38:17.130 --> 38:19.800
It's Mento.
He's going to his dark place.

38:19.835 --> 38:22.503
If we don't do something fast,
he's gonna take us with him.

38:26.773 --> 38:28.074
Rhea.

38:28.108 --> 38:30.409
They're starting to lose
control of their powers.

38:30.443 --> 38:31.612
You stay here, okay?

38:31.644 --> 38:33.313
Wait. What about the students?

38:33.347 --> 38:34.981
There aren't any.

38:35.016 --> 38:37.565
There never were.

38:41.889 --> 38:43.023
Hello, Joshua.

38:43.056 --> 38:45.059
Niles, thank God.
We have to move.

38:45.092 --> 38:47.661
- Mento has had another break.
- Forget him.

38:47.695 --> 38:50.063
And the others.

38:50.097 --> 38:54.746
You and I have more work to do.

38:55.369 --> 38:56.536
No.

38:56.570 --> 38:58.539
Come now, Joshua.

38:58.572 --> 39:01.442
You've done good work here.

39:01.476 --> 39:06.476
But you and I both know
where your talents truly lie.

39:06.780 --> 39:10.016
I can't.

39:10.050 --> 39:11.952
I told you...

39:11.985 --> 39:14.722
never again.

39:55.061 --> 39:57.097
<i>Sweet...</i>

39:57.130 --> 40:00.733
<i>sweet, sweet baby.</i>

40:00.768 --> 40:05.768
<i>Please don't keep me waiting.</i>

40:14.016 --> 40:19.016
Arani, I really think
you need to have a talk with your students.

40:22.755 --> 40:27.094
Arani?

40:27.128 --> 40:29.797
He's run off again.

40:29.829 --> 40:33.967
Who? Niles?

40:34.001 --> 40:36.471
Look what you did!

40:36.503 --> 40:38.873
- Oh, no, no.
- Look what you did!

41:13.407 --> 41:18.057
<i>Sweet, sweet baby.</i>

41:18.913 --> 41:21.481
<i>Sweet, sweet baby.</i>

41:21.514 --> 41:24.050
<i>Come join me!</i>

41:24.085 --> 41:26.753
<i>Sweet, sweet baby.</i>

41:26.786 --> 41:29.222
<i>Come join me!</i>

41:29.257 --> 41:32.393
Okay, this is gonna be okay.

41:32.427 --> 41:34.628
We just happen to be
in <i>The Shining.</i>

41:34.661 --> 41:35.797
Which is fine.

41:35.829 --> 41:38.398
Shelley Duvall and
the kid got out, and so will we.

41:38.432 --> 41:43.432
Captain Trainor, you and I know
there is no getting out.

41:43.938 --> 41:47.407
Once a soldier,
always a soldier.

41:47.442 --> 41:52.442
Now, are you and your partner
ready to continue our mission?

41:52.746 --> 41:54.981
This isn't happening.

41:55.014 --> 41:57.083
This isn't happening!

41:57.117 --> 41:59.387
I am so sorry.

41:59.420 --> 42:01.722
I didn't mean
for this to happen.

42:01.755 --> 42:03.657
Oh, Rita, let's be honest,

42:03.690 --> 42:08.690
you've been grinding this ax
for 60 years.

42:10.197 --> 42:12.632
You're doing this.

42:12.666 --> 42:14.335
Looks pretty real to me.

42:19.806 --> 42:22.009
You sick son of a bitch!

42:22.041 --> 42:23.943
Now, darling,

42:23.978 --> 42:28.177
we both know
you started it.

42:29.615 --> 42:32.385
I envy you, sir.

42:32.420 --> 42:37.420
You get to make the world
safe for democracy single-handedly.

42:38.559 --> 42:43.230
Well, almost single-handedly.

42:49.068 --> 42:53.072
Where is that bastard?

43:25.905 --> 43:30.706
<i>This is your room.</i>

43:33.514 --> 43:37.885
It wasn't always
like this.

43:37.918 --> 43:42.155
Niles formed the Doom Patrol back in
the day as part of a government program.

43:42.188 --> 43:45.559
He selected
their missions and...

43:45.592 --> 43:50.164
One of which inadvertently
put them on Mr. Nobody's radar.

43:50.197 --> 43:51.831
So they really did fight him?

43:51.864 --> 43:53.500
Yeah, but they lost.

43:53.532 --> 43:54.568
Big time.

43:54.601 --> 43:57.237
Mr. Nobody got into
their heads,

43:57.271 --> 43:59.139
preyed on their fears
and weaknesses.

43:59.172 --> 44:02.342
One by one, they all
turned on each other.

44:02.376 --> 44:04.846
They were never the same
after that.

44:04.878 --> 44:07.514
Their minds and bodies
started to deteriorate.

44:07.547 --> 44:10.617
They'd become frightened
and confused easily,

44:10.652 --> 44:14.054
and they would lash out
with their powers.

44:14.088 --> 44:18.057
They became a danger
to themselves, and to others.

44:18.092 --> 44:20.793
So, this was never a school?

44:20.827 --> 44:22.697
It was, uh...

44:22.730 --> 44:26.766
a safe place
for these folks to...

44:26.800 --> 44:31.072
To rest.

44:31.106 --> 44:34.342
I was able to stabilize
Mento's moods with medication.

44:34.375 --> 44:36.077
It was Niles' idea to
modify his helmet,

44:36.110 --> 44:39.681
to try to keep him calm
with an immersive group delusion.

44:39.713 --> 44:44.713
Mento hadn't made a peep
in 50 years.

44:44.818 --> 44:46.688
Until today.

44:46.721 --> 44:50.757
So, you're like what,
their babysitter?

44:50.791 --> 44:52.826
Physician, actually.

44:52.860 --> 44:54.295
I'm also a meta-human.

44:54.327 --> 44:56.630
I don't like to use my powers,

44:56.664 --> 44:59.166
but they're pretty good
to have around here.

44:59.199 --> 45:00.802
Just in case.

45:00.835 --> 45:03.570
Arani said
she's married to Niles.

45:03.603 --> 45:07.175
- Is that...
- All part of the fantasy.

45:07.208 --> 45:10.443
None of you should feel bad
about what you may have seen.

45:10.478 --> 45:13.447
That was just Mento
lashing out with his powers.

45:13.481 --> 45:15.449
Using your biggest fears
against you,

45:15.483 --> 45:18.117
like Mr. Nobody did to him,

45:18.152 --> 45:20.688
and to the others.

45:20.722 --> 45:23.456
Now, I think it's best if...

45:23.490 --> 45:27.293
If you all leave.

45:27.327 --> 45:31.228
What about Arani and Rhea?

45:38.371 --> 45:43.371
This is what their realities
are like.

45:49.416 --> 45:52.119
Don't leave me.

45:52.152 --> 45:55.422
Torturing themselves
with ghosts from their past.

45:55.456 --> 45:58.958
But you can fix it,
right?

45:58.992 --> 46:00.628
I don't know.

46:00.661 --> 46:05.311
Please, Niles...

46:06.132 --> 46:07.632
May I try?

46:21.514 --> 46:24.518
Whoa, whoa. Take it easy, son.

46:24.552 --> 46:27.253
Give yourself a minute.

46:27.288 --> 46:29.657
Am I okay?

46:29.690 --> 46:33.025
Everything looks fine.

46:33.059 --> 46:34.994
So, I'll be heading back.

46:35.027 --> 46:37.898
You gonna pack my bags too?

46:37.931 --> 46:40.668
Not unless you're planning
to come back with me.

46:40.702 --> 46:44.237
But if you would prefer
to be here,

46:44.271 --> 46:46.641
I think you should stay.

46:46.673 --> 46:49.043
Incidentally, I, uh...

46:49.076 --> 46:52.213
enabled your privacy mode.

46:52.246 --> 46:53.547
For real this time.

46:53.581 --> 46:56.115
I won't be
listening in anymore.

46:56.150 --> 46:57.485
I promise.

46:57.518 --> 47:02.518
Am I awake? Or are snakes
gonna start pouring out of your face?

47:02.590 --> 47:04.858
You've been telling me...

47:04.893 --> 47:07.260
you're ready to be
your own man.

47:07.293 --> 47:12.293
I think it's time
I start listening.

47:17.293 --> 47:18.293
Wait.

48:07.186 --> 48:10.490
What's wrong?

48:10.523 --> 48:12.393
How could you?

48:12.425 --> 48:14.427
What are you talking about?

48:14.461 --> 48:18.264
Marybeth?

48:18.298 --> 48:20.548
That poor girl.

48:23.471 --> 48:26.474
You read my mind.

48:26.507 --> 48:28.576
Without my permission.

48:28.608 --> 48:31.344
Don't you dare judge me.

48:31.378 --> 48:35.427
Not after what you've done.

48:37.485 --> 48:42.485
I'm just sorry
I didn't do it sooner.

48:50.264 --> 48:55.036
<i>A long time ago, you taught
me I was my own biggest obstacle,</i>

48:55.068 --> 49:00.068
that I could decide
who I wanted to be.

49:00.708 --> 49:02.943
For the last 60 years,
I decided that Rita Farr

49:02.976 --> 49:06.813
was someone who deserved
to be punished.

49:06.847 --> 49:10.184
I haven't changed my mind
about that.

49:10.217 --> 49:12.318
Rita Farr is...

49:12.353 --> 49:15.289
empty and ugly.

49:15.322 --> 49:18.726
And small.

49:18.759 --> 49:22.797
And I don't wanna be
those things anymore.

49:22.829 --> 49:27.829
I don't wanna be
Rita Farr anymore.

49:27.934 --> 49:32.934
Without her,
I don't know who I am.

49:33.005 --> 49:35.643
All I know is...

49:35.675 --> 49:38.778
I don't want to end up
like you.

49:38.813 --> 49:41.512
Or Arani, or Rhea.

49:44.351 --> 49:47.554
And, who knows.

49:47.588 --> 49:50.257
Maybe if I...

49:50.291 --> 49:55.291
stop trying to forget
the things that haunt me,

49:55.896 --> 49:57.798
and actually face them,

49:57.831 --> 50:02.831
maybe Mr. Nobody won't hold
so much power over me.

50:03.637 --> 50:07.608
I owe you for that.

50:07.641 --> 50:10.342
And I forgive you.

50:27.795 --> 50:31.094
Goodbye, Steve Dayton.

50:48.748 --> 50:52.652
How often
does he come see them?

50:52.686 --> 50:54.188
For real.

50:54.221 --> 50:58.025
Niles?

50:58.057 --> 50:59.659
Not very.

51:02.429 --> 51:04.264
So he just abandoned them?

51:04.297 --> 51:06.634
Like broken toys?

51:06.666 --> 51:09.570
Why would he send me here?

51:09.603 --> 51:12.340
I'm not broken.
He never treated me like I was broken.

51:12.373 --> 51:15.143
- Why would he wanna abandon me too?
- I think...

51:15.143 --> 51:17.445
this is something for you
to discuss with Niles directly.

51:17.445 --> 51:19.780
How the fuck am I supposed
to do that? He's missing.

51:19.813 --> 51:22.483
Then keep looking.

51:22.516 --> 51:26.653
'Cause I think that's what Mr. Nobody
really wants is for you to give up.

51:26.686 --> 51:28.822
That's why he sent you here.

51:28.856 --> 51:33.856
See what happens to those
who cross him.

51:34.661 --> 51:38.097
Good luck to you, Jane, and...

51:38.130 --> 51:40.132
For God sakes,

51:40.166 --> 51:44.538
you be careful.

51:57.918 --> 52:02.918
No offense, but your dad's
a real bite in the ass.

52:02.989 --> 52:05.125
Here.

52:05.157 --> 52:06.293
You hacked it.

52:06.327 --> 52:09.161
I created a profile for you,
sent her a friend request.

52:09.163 --> 52:09.929
She accepted it?

52:09.931 --> 52:12.365
She did. Only, um...

52:12.398 --> 52:14.001
she doesn't know it.

52:14.034 --> 52:17.871
Congratulations.
You're officially catfishing your daughter.

52:17.905 --> 52:20.474
Is this because
I stuck up for you with your pops?

52:20.507 --> 52:25.146
- You did?
- A little.

52:25.179 --> 52:27.949
I just thought that you should

52:27.981 --> 52:32.981
have the chance
to get to know your daughter.

52:35.322 --> 52:37.625
Maybe it's better
for both of you if you

52:37.657 --> 52:41.128
done it from afar.

52:59.481 --> 53:04.481
Been far too long
since we took some publicity photos.

53:05.219 --> 53:10.219
Folks are gonna start to forget
what the Doom Patrol means.

54:21.230 --> 54:28.023
<i>Captain Trainor, are you and
your partner ready to continue our mission?</i>

54:37.344 --> 54:41.282
I know.

54:41.315 --> 54:46.315
I don't wanna
think about it either.

55:45.612 --> 55:47.780
What the fuck?

55:47.815 --> 55:51.518
"Me and Dad"?

55:51.552 --> 55:54.722
What the hell is she doing
with Bump?

55:54.755 --> 55:57.423
Bump. Bump.

55:57.456 --> 55:59.159
Bump. Bump...

55:59.193 --> 56:03.831
Bump! Bump! Bump! Bump! Bump!

56:04.305 --> 56:10.729
