WEBVTT

00:08.063 --> 00:09.195
Ohh.

00:10.660 --> 00:12.808
Hurry it up, please.

00:12.896 --> 00:15.003
Patience, Em.
It takes a minute.

00:16.410 --> 00:18.253
Ooh.
Now it can take all day.

00:18.341 --> 00:20.285
- Why don't I just help you?
- Whoa, Em.

00:20.581 --> 00:22.847
Is that
my Jamaica Blue Mountain?

00:22.935 --> 00:24.001
I don't know.

00:24.089 --> 00:26.174
What's the difference between
that and flat earth coffee?

00:26.261 --> 00:27.667
- Ugh.
- About 50 bucks a pound.

00:27.755 --> 00:28.910
That's why we were
making this

00:28.997 --> 00:29.917
- for Sara...
- What?

00:30.005 --> 00:31.398
...and we were
drinking Earl Grey.

00:31.486 --> 00:35.566
Ooh, bless you. That's
the last of it for a while.

00:35.654 --> 00:38.309
It's post holidays,
and my credit cards are full.

00:38.460 --> 00:40.201
Didn't know your study
session turned

00:40.289 --> 00:42.495
into an all-nighter.

00:42.598 --> 00:44.078
Well, I'm cramming
for the bar.

00:44.166 --> 00:46.572
Makes the law school exam
look like a crossword puzzle.

00:46.660 --> 00:47.705
Hmm.

00:47.808 --> 00:49.269
- Here.
- Ahh.

00:50.229 --> 00:53.277
Hey! You sip
the Jamaica Blue Mountain.

00:54.666 --> 00:56.589
Coffee's on me,
Deputy Watkins.

00:58.473 --> 01:00.417
Ready?
I'll give you a ride.

01:00.683 --> 01:03.743
You packed your lunch?
I'm impressed.

01:03.831 --> 01:04.837
I'm trying.

01:04.925 --> 01:06.470
Can I get in
on the rideshare?

01:06.558 --> 01:08.025
I left my car
at the courthouse.

01:08.113 --> 01:10.134
How-How about I call you
an actual rideshare?

01:10.222 --> 01:11.876
It might be weird,
us showing up together.

01:11.963 --> 01:14.043
Two weeks ago, you kissed me
in front of all your friends.

01:14.130 --> 01:17.206
But not the whole courthouse.
I'll miss you till I see you.

01:17.294 --> 01:20.370
- Mmm! Bye.
- You two are so cute.

01:20.487 --> 01:21.722
Mwah. Bye!

01:23.777 --> 01:26.548
Mmm, mmm. New first day
of trial ritual...

01:26.636 --> 01:28.327
Best avocado toast
in town.

01:28.414 --> 01:30.807
That's $18 plus gratuity
for something

01:30.894 --> 01:32.026
I could spread
in my kitchen,

01:32.113 --> 01:36.048
but I do love 80 degrees
in January, though.

01:36.136 --> 01:37.597
Robin is so jealous.

01:37.684 --> 01:40.042
- How's he doing in D.C.?
- He's cold.

01:40.130 --> 01:43.814
How's your dad? He's an old guy in jail
facing a murder charge.

01:43.902 --> 01:45.066
He's okay.

01:45.347 --> 01:47.003
That's Amy Quinn's problem
for now.

01:47.091 --> 01:49.306
I need to keep my head clear.
Racist doctor's trial

01:49.394 --> 01:50.479
starts today.

01:50.566 --> 01:53.395
A biaseddoctor tried with
murder in criminal court.

01:53.482 --> 01:54.917
Not malpractice,
not neglect.

01:55.005 --> 01:56.137
It's already
a game-changer, Mark.

01:56.224 --> 01:58.204
Don't scare the jury.
Be covert.

01:58.292 --> 01:59.441
Fine. Biased.

01:59.529 --> 02:01.314
But a woman died
from internal bleeding,

02:01.402 --> 02:03.623
left a baby without a mother...
Totally preventable.

02:03.710 --> 02:05.556
Amen. Tell me again
what you got.

02:05.644 --> 02:07.337
- Expert witnesses.
- Mm-hmm.

02:07.425 --> 02:09.107
- Patient records showing prejudice.
- Yes!

02:09.193 --> 02:11.087
Testimony
from victim's husband

02:11.175 --> 02:12.730
proves their requests
for help

02:12.817 --> 02:13.980
- were ignored.
- Preach!

02:14.068 --> 02:15.200
But I got Campbell
on the bench.

02:15.287 --> 02:18.246
He makes Laski look like,
well... you.

02:18.333 --> 02:21.032
Campbell hasn't said a word
to me since I got called up,

02:21.119 --> 02:22.331
and getting hauled in front

02:22.419 --> 02:23.791
of the Committee
on Judicial Performance

02:23.878 --> 02:25.471
for abuse of power
didn't help.

02:25.558 --> 02:27.894
Doesn't matter. You nailed
the hearing. Your robe is safe.

02:27.982 --> 02:30.214
If I play the politics right.
The other judges,

02:30.302 --> 02:32.010
they might respect me,
but they don't know me.

02:32.097 --> 02:33.980
If what Laski said
about Benner is right,

02:34.068 --> 02:35.553
- I might need more friends.
- I don't know if

02:35.640 --> 02:37.229
I'd believe him.
Benner's been good to you.

02:37.316 --> 02:39.423
She has, and I'm gonna
continue to trust her

02:39.511 --> 02:40.834
until she gives me
a reason not to.

02:40.921 --> 02:43.236
But it won't hurt to join
the judges' inner circle.

02:43.324 --> 02:44.574
Join how?

02:44.691 --> 02:46.660
Like going
to the literacy gala?

02:46.902 --> 02:50.372
Ha ha! I'd like to see you
trade PJs for a black tie

02:50.460 --> 02:52.917
- on a school night.
- Challenge accepted.

02:53.011 --> 02:55.267
I just need to breach
the inner circle

02:55.355 --> 02:56.673
without stepping
on any toes.

02:56.761 --> 02:58.089
Never gonna happen!

02:58.268 --> 03:00.053
I'm a toe-stepper.

03:01.991 --> 03:05.441
D.A. offered three years,
which isn't really an offer.

03:05.831 --> 03:07.214
Maybe they have it out
for my mom.

03:07.316 --> 03:09.400
Congresswoman Valerie Moore
has a lot of enemies.

03:09.488 --> 03:10.565
- I don't blame them.
- Jeremy,

03:10.652 --> 03:12.953
you got caught
sabotaging the valves

03:13.040 --> 03:14.847
at an oil refinery
with a blowtorch.

03:14.935 --> 03:16.728
I was hoping to shut them
down for a while.

03:16.816 --> 03:18.845
That thing is
in a residential district.

03:18.933 --> 03:22.142
It's a crime. People are being
poisoned by toxic fumes.

03:22.230 --> 03:23.376
I had to do something.

03:23.464 --> 03:26.556
Which is why we're going
with the "necessity" defense.

03:26.644 --> 03:28.181
You acted in an emergency

03:28.269 --> 03:29.978
to prevent
significant bodily harm

03:30.066 --> 03:31.056
to the people
in that neighborhood,

03:31.144 --> 03:33.251
and you did not create
a greater danger

03:33.339 --> 03:35.618
than the one avoided
because, thankfully,

03:35.706 --> 03:37.347
you didn't blow up
the place.

03:39.349 --> 03:40.993
You look like
you're not sleeping.

03:41.081 --> 03:42.822
You don't have to stay
in custody.

03:42.910 --> 03:44.115
Let your mom
pay your bail.

03:44.202 --> 03:46.613
With her dirty
Big Oil money? No.

03:46.701 --> 03:47.990
Whatever is going on

03:48.078 --> 03:49.859
between you and your mom,
she's still your family.

03:49.946 --> 03:52.509
I found a new family...
3rd Rock Saviors.

03:52.597 --> 03:55.251
And its leader,
Ed Parker, yeah.

03:55.339 --> 03:56.588
He could have been
a good character witness

03:56.675 --> 03:58.291
if the D.A. wasn't using him
to help theircase.

03:58.378 --> 04:00.183
It's better if he doesn't
vouch for me.

04:00.402 --> 04:01.947
I didn't
go after that refinery

04:02.035 --> 04:03.699
as a 3rd Rock Savior.

04:03.863 --> 04:05.527
I did it for myself.

04:06.238 --> 04:09.258
Whatever your reason,
you wanted to help people,

04:09.346 --> 04:10.782
and we are gonna
prove that.

04:15.910 --> 04:18.055
Sherri?
How do I get into

04:18.144 --> 04:19.822
the Provoke Literacy Gala
tonight?

04:19.910 --> 04:21.611
You need to bribe someone
or crash it.

04:21.699 --> 04:23.040
That's been sold out
for weeks.

04:23.128 --> 04:25.243
You made a donation
in lieu of tickets.

04:25.331 --> 04:27.894
- Said you'd take PJs over...
- I know what I said.

04:27.982 --> 04:30.814
Then yousaid it would be
a good move to go, politically,

04:30.902 --> 04:32.129
that all the other judges
were going.

04:32.216 --> 04:35.370
Aren't you excited I'm listening to you?
Your timing could be better.

04:35.722 --> 04:37.527
I'll make some calls.

04:39.397 --> 04:41.144
I'll see what I can do.

04:41.386 --> 04:43.488
Congresswoman
Valerie Moore.

04:43.576 --> 04:45.761
She is a force.

04:47.000 --> 04:53.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:54.785 --> 04:57.079
I read that she went
against the governor

04:57.167 --> 04:58.822
and almost killed a law

04:58.910 --> 05:00.790
that would have banned
all new oil drilling

05:00.878 --> 05:02.894
in California by herself.

05:08.404 --> 05:10.251
Was that a civilian
visiting you

05:10.362 --> 05:11.886
in a restricted area?

05:12.425 --> 05:14.626
Valerie Moore and I
go way back.

05:14.714 --> 05:15.978
As her friend,
I can tell you

05:16.066 --> 05:17.354
don't listen to what
the press is saying.

05:17.441 --> 05:19.462
Yes,
she's a shrewd politician,

05:19.550 --> 05:21.647
but she's also
a very worried parent.

05:21.734 --> 05:23.997
She must be to come to court
for jury selection.

05:24.144 --> 05:26.730
To be honest, she wanted
to watch you in action,

05:26.878 --> 05:29.611
but I assured her
that, as my protégé,

05:29.698 --> 05:31.277
she can count on you

05:31.365 --> 05:34.316
for the fairest
of proceedings.

05:38.316 --> 05:40.103
My Lyft driver
this morning was crazy.

05:40.191 --> 05:41.705
Well, I'm glad
you got here alive.

05:41.793 --> 05:43.399
I hope I didn't
offend you earlier.

05:43.494 --> 05:45.886
No offense taken, especially
when you smile at me like that.

05:45.974 --> 05:47.551
You just missed some drama
with your client.

05:47.638 --> 05:48.543
I figure when I got

05:48.645 --> 05:50.137
the urgent message,
he wanted to see me.

05:50.224 --> 05:51.996
Well, the congresswoman,
his mother...

05:52.183 --> 05:53.439
She dropped Benner's name

05:53.527 --> 05:54.984
to influence her way
down here.

05:55.102 --> 05:56.938
She didn't care that it was
against the rules.

05:57.026 --> 05:58.930
She had to settle
on sending him a note.

06:00.512 --> 06:03.008
Jeremy? You all right?

06:03.938 --> 06:05.123
I wouldn't
have talked to her,

06:05.211 --> 06:06.851
even if it was allowed,
but she's got an idea

06:06.938 --> 06:09.266
- about my case that could work.
- What'd she say?

06:18.583 --> 06:21.020
Your Honor, my client
is exercising his right

06:21.108 --> 06:22.364
to request a bench trial.

06:22.452 --> 06:25.598
He is concerned about
the politics around this matter

06:25.686 --> 06:27.539
and feels that it's
in his best interest

06:27.626 --> 06:29.270
for Your Honor
to decide the case.

06:29.358 --> 06:30.803
Mr. Moore,
is that correct?

06:30.890 --> 06:32.785
You want to waive
your right to a jury?

06:32.873 --> 06:34.178
I do.

06:34.372 --> 06:36.037
Stand up.

06:37.092 --> 06:38.168
Yes, Your Honor.

06:38.295 --> 06:40.637
- Counsel, do you join the waiver?
- I join.

06:40.725 --> 06:44.139
- Mr. Berger, do the People join?
- Cautiously, Your Honor.

06:44.272 --> 06:47.295
Brief recess. 
Then let's begin.

06:50.419 --> 06:51.973
She steps into the building,

06:52.061 --> 06:54.645
visits my boss,
plants herself in my courtroom,

06:54.740 --> 06:55.668
and all of a sudden,

06:55.756 --> 06:57.676
I'm the person deciding
her son's fate?

06:57.764 --> 06:58.926
You need to tread carefully.

06:59.014 --> 07:01.452
I'll tread
according to the evidence.

07:02.086 --> 07:04.176
If that means getting
on the wrong side

07:04.264 --> 07:06.950
of Valerie Moore,
then so be it.

Captioned by Los Angeles
Distribution and Broadcasting, Inc.

07:15.428 --> 07:16.539
All right, Niles,

07:16.627 --> 07:18.122
let's go over your testimony
one more time.

07:18.209 --> 07:22.028
Again? Okay.
Joy had an emergency cesarean.

07:22.116 --> 07:23.491
After Austin was born,

07:23.595 --> 07:27.084
Joy started feeling,
uh, chest pains, fatigue.

07:27.172 --> 07:30.296
- She, um, asked for more tests.
- Do you need help?

07:30.384 --> 07:32.233
No, I got this.

07:32.577 --> 07:34.764
Joy complained
about that monster.

07:34.852 --> 07:36.202
Dr. Timothy Gipson.

07:36.290 --> 07:38.423
He never said her name.
Called her "Miss."

07:38.511 --> 07:41.834
Dr. Gipson ignored
your wife's pain on purpose.

07:42.034 --> 07:44.545
That type of neglect
made his actions criminal.

07:44.817 --> 07:47.741
We can win this. We just
have to convince a jury

07:47.889 --> 07:49.772
of the source
of that neglect...

07:49.958 --> 07:51.395
Conscious bias.

07:52.600 --> 07:54.436
Oh. Here we go.

07:54.729 --> 07:56.108
- Diaper duty.
- Ah.

07:56.196 --> 07:58.372
It's like, uh, clockwork.

07:58.460 --> 08:00.045
Here you go.

08:02.522 --> 08:04.467
- Uh...
- Gotta grab my stuff.

08:05.550 --> 08:06.899
All right.

08:09.106 --> 08:10.498
Okay.

08:10.748 --> 08:12.217
Stopped by your office.

08:12.305 --> 08:14.742
Had an emergency.
Quinn, Niles.Hi.

08:14.830 --> 08:16.426
- Hey.
- Ah! He's adorable.

08:16.515 --> 08:18.489
And capable of a 7.5
on the Richter.

08:18.577 --> 08:21.241
Aftershocks are coming.
Godspeed.

08:24.530 --> 08:27.262
Niles, don't.
Take Austin inside.

08:27.353 --> 08:29.817
I'll see you later today.

08:33.105 --> 08:34.697
It's Dr. Gipson.

08:34.784 --> 08:36.051
Bad vibes there.

08:36.138 --> 08:37.751
What, you researching
my trials now?

08:37.840 --> 08:38.995
Don't you have
better things to do,

08:39.082 --> 08:41.033
like working
on my father's case?

08:41.121 --> 08:42.520
A doctor charged
with murder...

08:42.607 --> 08:44.520
Talk of the private firm
grapevine.

08:44.698 --> 08:46.004
You asked me to stop by
because...

08:46.091 --> 08:48.093
- I need an update.
- You wanted to see me.

08:48.329 --> 08:49.635
- And you need help...
- You can admit it.

08:49.722 --> 08:51.422
...deciphering Vic Callan,
reading between the lines.

08:51.509 --> 08:53.492
Your dad
doesn't trust me yet.

08:53.580 --> 08:55.016
Still claiming
he walked in

08:55.104 --> 08:56.797
and found
Addison Farwell dead,

08:56.885 --> 08:58.687
likely after one
of her infamous card games,

08:58.774 --> 09:01.255
which isn't much of a counter
to the prosecution's case.

09:01.342 --> 09:02.182
What does
the prosecution have?

09:02.270 --> 09:03.518
Taking their time
with discovery.

09:03.605 --> 09:05.875
Apparently, two days
before Addison dies,

09:05.963 --> 09:07.367
your dad gets
into a shouting match

09:07.455 --> 09:09.229
- with one of her guys.
- Gambling debts?

09:09.317 --> 09:11.102
It might involve a guy
named Kurt Flannery,

09:11.190 --> 09:13.399
an old friend of Vic's.
Talk to him. He's... I wasn't finished.

09:13.486 --> 09:16.648
There's a witness. Claims Vic
got very tough guy about it.

09:16.736 --> 09:18.713
- So motive.
- Except I don't buy it.

09:18.801 --> 09:20.762
Vic doesn't seem like
the pre-emptive strike type.

09:20.862 --> 09:22.886
I thought you were resistant
to the Callan charm.

09:22.987 --> 09:25.870
Just yours.
I think he's innocent, Mark.

09:26.284 --> 09:28.339
Yeah. Maybe.

09:28.784 --> 09:30.808
Do you want me
to win this case?

09:35.042 --> 09:36.511
Okay.

09:40.508 --> 09:41.727
Water?

09:41.815 --> 09:43.704
- Ah...
- Still or sparkling?

09:43.792 --> 09:45.634
No, sparkling
gives me heartburn.

09:45.722 --> 09:48.212
Still it is.
Judge Campbell.

09:48.300 --> 09:50.438
Congresswoman
Valerie Moore's son

09:50.526 --> 09:52.350
is about to appear
before me.

09:52.437 --> 09:54.610
I could use your advice,
judge to judge.

09:54.698 --> 09:56.985
How to walk that...
political tightrope.

09:57.073 --> 09:59.226
Oh, go on.
Ow coy.

09:59.360 --> 10:02.510
I think you'll be just fine,
Judge Carmichael.

10:02.708 --> 10:05.266
Then perhaps you could
use my help.

10:05.354 --> 10:07.219
Your doctor murder trial,
I'll admit

10:07.307 --> 10:09.289
I have a vested interest
as a black woman.

10:09.377 --> 10:11.000
And thoughts
on the justice system's

10:11.088 --> 10:12.549
responsibility
in cases like that.

10:12.637 --> 10:14.458
Well, I don't see race.
I see facts.

10:14.546 --> 10:15.908
One and the same
in that trial.

10:15.996 --> 10:17.588
Let's talk about it
tonight at the gala,

10:17.676 --> 10:20.055
if I can find
a last-minute ticket.

10:20.143 --> 10:23.096
They sold out
while I was preoccupied with the CJP.

10:23.229 --> 10:25.094
I'll tell ya, I got
an empty seat at the table

10:25.182 --> 10:28.156
I purchased for the gala,
so why don't you just join me?

10:28.244 --> 10:31.846
I'm curious about...
your thoughts.

10:39.587 --> 10:41.023
The defendant's
patient history...

10:41.111 --> 10:42.367
As an obstetrician,

10:42.455 --> 10:44.141
did anything stand out
to you, Dr. Salazar?

10:44.228 --> 10:46.078
Individually, the records
appeared to be fine,

10:46.166 --> 10:47.622
but when evaluated
as a group,

10:47.709 --> 10:50.150
- patterns started to emerge.
- What types of patterns?

10:50.238 --> 10:53.281
Over the last four years,
three women in Dr. Gipson's care

10:53.369 --> 10:56.039
experienced extreme
postpartum hardship.

10:56.127 --> 10:57.604
All three were
African-American.

10:57.692 --> 11:00.047
And how did
non-African-American women

11:00.135 --> 11:01.930
with similar
complications fare?

11:02.018 --> 11:03.799
They received
more examinations

11:03.887 --> 11:05.867
and appropriate medication
for their pain.

11:05.955 --> 11:08.273
- That discrepancy is alarming.
- Nothing further.

11:08.361 --> 11:11.609
Dr. Salazar, did you find
anything in my client's records

11:11.697 --> 11:13.695
that indicated
negligent behavior?

11:13.783 --> 11:15.781
He prescribed
less medication,

11:15.869 --> 11:17.957
asked for fewer
follow-up procedures,

11:18.044 --> 11:20.984
and spent less time with his
African-American patients.

11:21.072 --> 11:23.267
Is that negligent behavior?

11:23.354 --> 11:24.846
I'd argue it could be, yes.

11:24.934 --> 11:27.618
The charge is murder here.
Malice and intent are crucial.

11:27.706 --> 11:30.687
Did Dr. Gipson ever
do anything that indicated

11:30.775 --> 11:32.344
he intended to harm
his patients?

11:32.432 --> 11:33.541
No, not that I saw.

11:33.629 --> 11:35.711
Was there anything
that he did that showed

11:35.799 --> 11:38.055
a conscious disregard
for the lives of his patients?

11:38.143 --> 11:40.033
- No, not directly.
- Right.

11:41.508 --> 11:43.075
No further questions.

11:49.236 --> 11:50.945
Congressman Moore,
what do you have to say

11:51.033 --> 11:52.313
about your son
being an ecoterrorist?

11:52.400 --> 11:54.702
- No comment.
- Well, the real ecoterrorists

11:54.790 --> 11:56.358
are the ones
that Congresswoman Moore

11:56.446 --> 11:59.001
fights so hard to protect...
Big Oil.

11:59.165 --> 12:01.827
Ed Parker,
founder of 3rd Rock Saviors.

12:01.915 --> 12:03.057
The group Moore's son
is a part of?

12:03.144 --> 12:06.759
Yes. Yes, Jeremy is a part
of our family.

12:07.087 --> 12:08.631
All rise.

12:15.962 --> 12:17.274
Hey, do you mind?

12:17.362 --> 12:20.063
He's, uh,
calmer in small spaces.

12:20.157 --> 12:22.290
Whew!
That is fragrant.

12:22.378 --> 12:24.424
Oh, man,
it's Southern-fried okra.

12:24.519 --> 12:28.095
It's fire. But I mostly did
the cooking before, um...

12:28.962 --> 12:30.509
How's it going in there?

12:31.056 --> 12:34.241
Uh, we took a bit of a hit
on the expert witness,

12:34.329 --> 12:36.217
but we'll counter
with the nurse's testimony.

12:36.305 --> 12:38.858
- So we're screwed?
- I knew it.

12:39.805 --> 12:40.959
It's foolish.

12:41.047 --> 12:43.129
Niles, take a second.
Breathe.

12:43.216 --> 12:44.609
I can't stop,
not even for a second.

12:44.696 --> 12:46.906
That happened before,
and then she was gone.

12:56.680 --> 12:57.821
I know he did this,

12:57.909 --> 13:00.438
but I can't help
but feel like I'm guilty.

13:02.656 --> 13:03.739
Like I failed her.

13:03.827 --> 13:05.711
You did not fail her.

13:09.164 --> 13:10.762
We have a strategy.

13:10.938 --> 13:12.917
We're putting you up last
because we want the emotion

13:13.004 --> 13:14.943
to carry through
to the jury.

13:16.183 --> 13:18.700
My advice...
take Austin home.

13:19.301 --> 13:21.606
Get some rest
before you testify tomorrow.

13:23.169 --> 13:25.161
The People call Ed Parker.

13:28.434 --> 13:29.707
Remember, he's on our side,

13:29.795 --> 13:32.567
even if the prosecution is
trying to use him against us.

13:35.297 --> 13:37.901
You run an organization
called 3rd Rock Saviors?

13:37.989 --> 13:39.901
It's called
3rd Rock Saviors!

13:39.989 --> 13:42.871
There's an exclamation mark,
and we pronounce it.

13:42.974 --> 13:47.012
We peacefully protest to expose
local environmental concerns.

13:47.100 --> 13:49.963
You say that, but there were
arrests in San Pedro,

13:50.051 --> 13:52.856
and incidents in refineries
in Huntington Beach and Carson.

13:52.944 --> 13:54.973
Are you running
an extremist eco organization?

13:55.061 --> 13:57.542
No. We're passionate,
but sometimes...

13:57.630 --> 13:58.936
Sometimes what?

13:59.423 --> 14:01.510
Did you plot the attack
at the refinery

14:01.598 --> 14:02.957
the defendant
is accused of doing?

14:03.045 --> 14:04.106
Are you an accomplice?

14:04.194 --> 14:06.152
No,
I tried to stop him.

14:09.653 --> 14:10.698
Are you saying

14:10.786 --> 14:12.478
that the defendant
talked to you

14:12.566 --> 14:14.104
- about this crime?
- Objection.

14:14.192 --> 14:15.613
Overruled.

14:16.278 --> 14:17.789
Jeremy, I'm sorry.

14:18.082 --> 14:21.551
So you knew the defendant
was gonna commit this crime?

14:21.783 --> 14:24.573
He told me what he was gonna do.
I begged him not to.

14:24.661 --> 14:26.928
A blowtorch?
People could have been hurt.

14:27.015 --> 14:30.012
The very same people
my organization tries to help.

14:30.911 --> 14:32.575
Nothing further, Your Honor.

14:32.738 --> 14:34.309
Ms. Lopez?

14:39.676 --> 14:41.204
You said you tried
to stop him.

14:41.291 --> 14:43.604
Do you really believe
he set out to hurt people?

14:43.692 --> 14:45.317
He's got a good heart.

14:45.995 --> 14:47.471
He just got carried away

14:47.559 --> 14:50.323
because his mother
isn't present in his life,

14:50.411 --> 14:52.637
off in D.C.,
protecting corporations

14:52.731 --> 14:54.002
that are destroying
the planet.

14:54.090 --> 14:56.067
He said she drove him
to do this.

14:56.155 --> 14:58.721
Objection. We're talking
about Jeremy, not his mother.

14:58.809 --> 15:01.543
Sustained as to the reasoning.
That will be stricken.

15:01.770 --> 15:04.496
Did Jeremy say
he was targeting the refinery

15:04.621 --> 15:07.362
in response to the urgency
of the situation?

15:07.450 --> 15:09.315
What these refineries
are doing to people

15:09.403 --> 15:10.981
should be outlawed.

15:11.613 --> 15:14.018
But sadly, what he was
trying to do, I think,

15:14.106 --> 15:16.973
was make a statement
by embarrassing his mother.

15:18.262 --> 15:19.567
Nothing further.

15:21.137 --> 15:22.810
Prosecution rests,
Your Honor.

15:22.965 --> 15:25.106
Then court is adjourned
for today.

15:35.357 --> 15:37.651
That just killed
our "necessity" defense.

15:37.739 --> 15:39.518
He said he wouldn't do that.
He promised me.

15:39.606 --> 15:42.198
He promised you what?
What else do I need to know?

15:42.286 --> 15:43.793
Nothing that matters.

15:56.426 --> 15:58.582
Something's not right.
Jeremy's passionate,

15:58.669 --> 16:00.339
but I don't believe he ever
wanted to hurt anyone.

16:00.426 --> 16:02.833
Well, I'll tell you what I saw...
A troubled kid with Mom issues.

16:02.920 --> 16:04.830
Yeah. Something's up
with her, too.

16:05.629 --> 16:07.401
Which you can
figure out tomorrow.

16:07.504 --> 16:09.042
If you're okay being done
talking about work,

16:09.129 --> 16:12.168
I'd like you
to enjoy this...

16:12.552 --> 16:13.684
with me.

16:14.043 --> 16:15.270
Okay.

16:16.809 --> 16:18.801
I love the energy
at the beach,

16:19.020 --> 16:20.090
the smell of the ocean,

16:20.178 --> 16:23.075
all the people
blending together.

16:23.504 --> 16:25.217
After dinner,
let's go back to my place.

16:25.441 --> 16:28.219
Let's make it myplace.
It'll be my honor

16:28.307 --> 16:30.092
to inconvenience you
with a Lyft...

16:30.180 --> 16:31.408
...in the morning.

16:32.300 --> 16:33.862
Come here.

16:48.644 --> 16:50.275
Flannery. Long time.

16:50.363 --> 16:52.447
Callan.
Rhymes with "gallon."

16:52.535 --> 16:54.205
And "conspiracy."

16:54.332 --> 16:57.150
Listen, uh,
Vic's in a bit of a bind.

16:57.238 --> 16:59.150
You heard about
this Addison Farwell thing?

16:59.238 --> 17:01.205
- Yeah, why?
- Vic was found at the scene.

17:01.293 --> 17:02.939
They're charging him
with murder.

17:03.027 --> 17:05.204
Says he didn't do it,
but I'm guessing, Flannery,

17:05.292 --> 17:07.126
you might be able
to fill in some blanks.

17:07.214 --> 17:08.532
There you go.

17:08.621 --> 17:10.691
This all the bribe
you can afford?

17:10.917 --> 17:14.175
I told Vic the old days
were dead and gone.

17:14.621 --> 17:16.298
This new crew,
the Armenians?

17:16.386 --> 17:17.748
It's all about territory
with them.

17:17.835 --> 17:21.012
It's all they care about,
and they are fierce.

17:21.299 --> 17:23.406
So when Vic got
his little game going...

17:23.493 --> 17:25.008
Vic was running
a card game?

17:25.096 --> 17:27.976
You didn't know that?
Just a local game,

17:28.063 --> 17:30.274
a bunch of young tech guys
with too much money.

17:30.362 --> 17:31.977
And Vic's got the look,
right?

17:32.065 --> 17:33.459
Old school mob guy.

17:33.546 --> 17:36.114
- Yeah.
- These kids ate it up.

17:36.260 --> 17:39.335
It was a lucrative game. But it's
on the Armenians' turf.

17:39.422 --> 17:42.573
He thought they wouldn't care.
He was wrong.

17:43.791 --> 17:45.078
You want to hear
my theory?

17:45.166 --> 17:46.284
Sure.

17:47.603 --> 17:49.039
Vic's a pawn.

17:49.284 --> 17:52.494
The Armenians want
Addison Farwell dead

17:52.768 --> 17:54.758
for whatever reason.
Could be anything, right?

17:54.846 --> 17:56.110
He owes them a favor.

17:56.198 --> 17:57.440
They don't take no
for an answer.

17:57.527 --> 17:59.422
So he pays Addison
a visit.

17:59.494 --> 18:01.901
Bang-bang,
problem solved.

18:02.300 --> 18:03.792
It's a theory.

18:04.182 --> 18:06.854
A good one.
You eating this?

18:08.995 --> 18:11.062
It's conveyor-belt
justice.

18:11.149 --> 18:13.001
Coined by bleeding hearts.

18:13.089 --> 18:14.641
Look, we gotta keep
things moving,

18:14.729 --> 18:16.454
and your way
gums up the works.

18:16.542 --> 18:18.016
Yes, I do get backlogged

18:18.104 --> 18:20.110
because I look at more
than just the facts.

18:20.198 --> 18:21.962
And that is where
the trouble starts.

18:22.050 --> 18:24.696
See, when a judge gets soft,
lets somebody go,

18:24.784 --> 18:27.440
comes right back
to bite him in the robe.

18:29.338 --> 18:31.753
I didn't mean
your unfortunate car thief.

18:32.392 --> 18:34.721
Tell me this.
Would you do it again?

18:34.809 --> 18:35.948
I think I would.

18:36.044 --> 18:39.626
- I think that is ridiculous.
- I don't think you do.

18:39.714 --> 18:41.001
You look at things
as either/or.

18:41.089 --> 18:43.834
I don't have that luxury.
You might not understand it,

18:43.921 --> 18:45.550
but you're curious
about it.

18:46.440 --> 18:48.099
Judge Campbell...

18:49.525 --> 18:51.688
Uh, Congresswoman Moore,

18:51.776 --> 18:53.344
I didn't expect
to see you this evening.

18:53.432 --> 18:55.657
This is one of my favorite
charities, Albert.

18:55.745 --> 18:57.628
Judge Carmichael,
you look lovely.

18:57.716 --> 19:00.241
Congresswoman Moore,
we really shouldn't be speaking.

19:00.329 --> 19:02.743
Can't help who we run into
at social gatherings, can we?

19:02.831 --> 19:04.355
Albert, make sure
we don't break any rules.

19:04.442 --> 19:06.112
No.
Be my guest.

19:09.599 --> 19:12.253
I will not discuss
your son's case.

19:12.659 --> 19:14.829
This is
highly inappropriate.

19:14.917 --> 19:17.087
I want you
to understand my family.

19:17.175 --> 19:19.493
It's only been me and Jeremy
since his father died.

19:19.581 --> 19:21.112
He's a good boy.

19:21.917 --> 19:22.954
I've made mistakes.

19:23.042 --> 19:24.938
Congresswoman,
if you continue,

19:25.026 --> 19:27.196
I will be forced
to declare a conflict

19:27.284 --> 19:30.010
and remove myself
from your son's case.

19:30.839 --> 19:32.182
We can't have that.

19:33.807 --> 19:35.668
I've heard
you're sympathetic

19:35.755 --> 19:37.854
to the circumstances
around defendants.

19:37.942 --> 19:39.030
Good night.

19:39.237 --> 19:40.565
Congresswoman.

19:49.807 --> 19:52.665
Valerie Moore has taken up
residence in my courtroom.

19:52.753 --> 19:53.844
She ambushed me
last night,

19:53.932 --> 19:55.314
and I think Campbell
orchestrated it.

19:55.401 --> 19:57.454
I'm not sure he's that shady.
From what Laski said,

19:57.542 --> 20:00.032
- Benner could have done it.
- Maybe. I'll start with Campbell.

20:00.120 --> 20:01.675
Man has a mean poker face.

20:01.763 --> 20:03.462
I need to get in his head
and shake him up.

20:03.550 --> 20:05.993
Please don't piss him off.
I'm still presenting my case.

20:06.081 --> 20:08.094
Ooh, I think I'll come watch.
Thank you.

20:08.182 --> 20:10.790
That's literally the opposite
of what I just said.

20:10.878 --> 20:13.329
Judges stay out of
other judges' courtrooms, Lola.

20:13.417 --> 20:15.417
It's accepted wisdom.
It's not even a rule.

20:16.869 --> 20:20.297
I've worked as Dr. Gipson's
nurse for the last 10 years.

20:20.385 --> 20:24.149
He's an excellent doctor.
He's caring, attentive.

20:24.237 --> 20:25.892
- Patients love him.
- I see.

20:25.980 --> 20:28.579
Did Joy Allen ever file
a complaint about Dr. Gipson

20:28.667 --> 20:30.774
- to you, Ms. Perkins?
- Yes, that happened.

20:30.862 --> 20:33.659
And based on your previous
characterization, do you find it odd

20:33.747 --> 20:35.307
that Joy didn't speak directly
to Dr. Gipson?

20:35.394 --> 20:36.563
I don't know.

20:36.651 --> 20:38.243
Well, yes, but...

20:38.331 --> 20:39.438
Ms. Perkins,

20:39.526 --> 20:41.071
did you ever notice anything

20:41.159 --> 20:43.475
that might have led to a direct
communication breakdown

20:43.562 --> 20:44.930
between Joy and Dr. Gipson?

20:45.018 --> 20:48.542
Dr. Gipson and Joy didn't...
He...

20:56.687 --> 20:58.341
Ms. Perkins,
you're under oath here.

20:58.444 --> 21:00.194
Let's answer the question.

21:00.913 --> 21:03.765
Dr. Gipson and Joy
disagreed.

21:04.192 --> 21:06.601
They were cordial
until they weren't.

21:06.726 --> 21:08.022
Yes, it's possible

21:08.109 --> 21:10.177
that he didn't get along
with her, but...

21:10.265 --> 21:12.239
Did you ever hear
the defendant verbalize

21:12.327 --> 21:14.077
the way he felt about Joy?

21:17.468 --> 21:20.577
I remember exactly what
he said in the breakroom.

21:20.718 --> 21:24.022
"How dare she have
the audacity to complain,"

21:24.155 --> 21:27.216
that we can't be responsible
for her actions

21:27.304 --> 21:28.911
if she just kept
the weight off

21:28.999 --> 21:30.585
like he told her.

21:31.327 --> 21:33.778
Someone of her...
background.

21:33.866 --> 21:36.085
It's not our fault.
It's theirs.

21:36.226 --> 21:38.021
The court appreciates
your honesty, Ms. Perkins.

21:38.108 --> 21:39.442
No more questions.

21:39.530 --> 21:41.733
- Mrs. Taylor.
- Ms. Perkins,

21:41.944 --> 21:43.990
is there any reason
why you didn't approach Dr. Gipson

21:44.077 --> 21:46.741
about his so-called
biased tirades?

21:46.835 --> 21:48.981
He's my boss.
I'm sitting here now,

21:49.069 --> 21:50.716
wondering if I'm
ever gonna work again.

21:50.803 --> 21:53.755
Yeah, I can imagine
how difficult your job must be,

21:53.843 --> 21:56.536
seeing people
at their lowest every day.

21:56.624 --> 21:59.030
They say things
that they don't really mean.

21:59.132 --> 22:02.497
Do those hurtful comments ever
impact the care you provide?

22:02.585 --> 22:03.630
Absolutely not.

22:03.718 --> 22:06.294
I treat every patient
with the utmost respect,

22:06.382 --> 22:08.430
meet our patients
where they are.

22:08.663 --> 22:11.052
How many people
do you think would be jailed

22:11.140 --> 22:13.169
for things said in confidence
with friends

22:13.257 --> 22:14.340
or with trusted colleagues?

22:14.428 --> 22:16.124
- Objection.
- Your Honor...

22:19.899 --> 22:21.272
Your Honor?

22:21.437 --> 22:22.364
Apologies.

22:22.452 --> 22:23.981
I am in need
of a recess here.

22:24.069 --> 22:25.882
Shouldn't take longer
than 15.

22:25.969 --> 22:28.458
How about this?
Does it seem like I'm lying in wait?

22:28.546 --> 22:29.755
I want to set a tone.

22:29.842 --> 22:32.802
Mm, mm, sit at your desk.
It's more ominous.

22:32.927 --> 22:34.569
Ooh. I like ominous.

22:42.361 --> 22:43.631
Got this.

22:48.906 --> 22:50.517
Come in.

22:51.896 --> 22:54.339
Bold move,
making me find you.

22:54.427 --> 22:56.026
That and coming
into my courtroom...

22:56.114 --> 22:57.208
I'd just like to ask.

22:57.296 --> 22:59.409
Did you plan to
help Moore ambush me

22:59.497 --> 23:00.933
when you invited me
to the gala?

23:01.021 --> 23:02.698
You invited yourself.

23:02.786 --> 23:04.877
As for Moore
ambushing you,

23:05.083 --> 23:07.893
I deplore that kind
of unethical behavior.

23:07.981 --> 23:10.036
Good!
I will resume considering

23:10.124 --> 23:11.833
whether or
not I like you.

23:16.411 --> 23:17.716
You know, I wasn't sure

23:17.803 --> 23:19.886
when Benner hand-picked you
for the Moore trial.

23:19.974 --> 23:21.323
I mean, you and Benner
are close.

23:21.411 --> 23:24.222
She's... friendly
with the congresswoman.

23:24.310 --> 23:25.745
I was just worried that

23:25.833 --> 23:28.597
you and Moore might
become friendly, too.

23:28.739 --> 23:30.130
Glad I was wrong.

23:33.974 --> 23:36.456
The victim, Joy,
and that doctor...

23:36.544 --> 23:39.739
May I ask, has something like
this ever happened to you?

23:40.310 --> 23:44.378
No, not me, but my mother
had a heart attack

23:44.466 --> 23:45.933
because one doctor
wouldn't listen,

23:46.021 --> 23:47.408
and another saved
her life.

23:47.496 --> 23:49.224
But was it about race?

23:49.481 --> 23:51.450
I don't know
for sure,

23:51.592 --> 23:54.737
but, because of Gipson,
you now know the stats.

23:54.825 --> 23:58.622
There's no either/or
about numbers, just facts.

23:59.317 --> 24:00.401
If it's all right,

24:00.489 --> 24:03.325
I'd like to be present
for the verdict.

24:04.652 --> 24:05.954
All right.

24:09.806 --> 24:13.116
I wasn't planning
on stealing or hurting anyone

24:13.204 --> 24:15.218
or destroying property
just to destroy it.

24:15.306 --> 24:17.759
The refinery is poisoning
that neighborhood.

24:17.907 --> 24:21.304
People are losing their sense
of smell, rashes, cancer.

24:21.392 --> 24:23.601
Tankers carrying containers
of flammable oil

24:23.689 --> 24:24.890
roll through there every day.

24:24.978 --> 24:26.712
There are
constant spills and leaks.

24:26.800 --> 24:29.702
So you were trying to do
what you thought was right,

24:29.790 --> 24:31.704
not just getting back
at your mom.

24:32.157 --> 24:35.407
My mom isn't really
a part of my life anymore.

24:56.215 --> 24:57.730
Come in.

24:58.386 --> 25:00.806
You handpicked me
for the Moore trial

25:00.894 --> 25:03.275
as a favor to your friend
in exchange for what?

25:03.363 --> 25:05.822
A "not guilty" verdict?
Leniency?

25:05.910 --> 25:08.369
It's not unethical to reassure
a concerned mother

25:08.457 --> 25:11.095
that her son's judge is fair
almost to a fault.

25:11.183 --> 25:13.806
Is she concerned about him
or her future in politics?

25:13.894 --> 25:16.580
Why can't it be both?
We all have our future to consider.

25:16.668 --> 25:18.853
What concerns me right now
is Congresswoman Moore.

25:18.941 --> 25:20.463
She approached me
in public.

25:20.551 --> 25:21.931
That move was ill-advised.

25:22.019 --> 25:24.166
No matter how I rule now,
it's tainted.

25:24.254 --> 25:26.182
Either it looks like
I caved to political pressure,

25:26.269 --> 25:27.650
or it looks like
retribution.

25:27.738 --> 25:30.298
Again, it's not unethical
to do things that benefit

25:30.386 --> 25:32.982
both yourself as well as others.
Try to enjoy it.

25:33.537 --> 25:35.800
I look forward
to your ruling.

25:41.792 --> 25:43.384
Joy was my world.

25:44.409 --> 25:46.128
She loved planning things.

25:46.853 --> 25:48.692
Half birthdays,

25:50.002 --> 25:52.643
"because I love you"
staycations.

25:53.323 --> 25:54.924
Austin has her eyes.

25:55.049 --> 25:57.635
I say her name to him
every night.

26:01.272 --> 26:03.299
I hope
that it's his first word.

26:03.924 --> 26:06.407
Six years of marriage,
and she...

26:06.495 --> 26:08.001
She never stopped
surprising me.

26:08.089 --> 26:10.628
She never stopped loving me
or a job

26:10.964 --> 26:12.601
or whatever life had given her.

26:12.689 --> 26:15.458
She was grateful,
even in the end.

26:16.447 --> 26:17.956
And now she's gone.

26:19.432 --> 26:21.086
Could you describe
Joy's interactions

26:21.174 --> 26:22.368
with the defendant?

26:22.456 --> 26:24.329
Joy didn't take no
for an answer.

26:24.417 --> 26:26.571
Dr. Gipson,
he didn't like that.

26:26.659 --> 26:27.515
Joy knew her rights,

26:27.602 --> 26:30.300
and she wasn't afraid
to make noise.

26:30.596 --> 26:33.829
After the complaint,
he treated her like casework.

26:33.917 --> 26:35.774
Cut and dry.
He was inhumane.

26:35.862 --> 26:37.672
- Objection.
- Overruled.

26:37.822 --> 26:39.589
Continue, Mr. Allen.

26:41.331 --> 26:45.331
Joy had to sit there
as a bystander

26:45.424 --> 26:47.227
to her own
deteriorating health.

26:52.370 --> 26:57.643
Being silenced, um, that can
erase your will to fight.

27:06.745 --> 27:09.003
You couldn't possibly know
what that's like.

27:17.683 --> 27:20.876
Joy didn't trust me. I tried,
but you have to understand,

27:20.964 --> 27:23.313
I deliver hundreds of newborns
a year.

27:23.401 --> 27:25.274
My office can be
a revolving door

27:25.362 --> 27:27.885
of pain and suffering,
and, yes, anger.

27:28.001 --> 27:30.033
I never got to know Joy
the way that you described her.

27:30.120 --> 27:31.760
- I wish I had.
- Thank you.

27:31.847 --> 27:33.081
No further questions.

27:33.169 --> 27:35.159
Uh, Mr. Callan.

27:37.259 --> 27:39.610
I'd like to talk
about audacity.

27:39.861 --> 27:41.971
Dr. Gipson, what did you mean
when you said

27:42.059 --> 27:45.102
Joy Allen had
the audacity to complain?

27:45.190 --> 27:46.660
- I don't recall that clearly...
- In your mind,

27:46.747 --> 27:49.532
what kind of people
get to be audacious?

27:49.655 --> 27:52.057
What about Joy made her
not one of those people?

27:52.145 --> 27:53.833
- Objection.
- I was just telling the truth.

27:53.920 --> 27:55.826
The truth?
The truth about what?

27:55.914 --> 27:57.462
Studies have proven
that black women have

27:57.549 --> 27:59.573
higher rates of obesity
and high blood pressure

27:59.661 --> 28:01.401
which often complicate
childbirth.

28:01.489 --> 28:04.198
Don't studies also show that
black women's health issues

28:04.286 --> 28:05.901
are largely impacted
by racism?

28:05.996 --> 28:08.448
I will not be held accountable
for someone's poor choices.

28:08.536 --> 28:11.336
Joy Allen asked you to run
additional tests multiple times.

28:11.424 --> 28:12.583
Why did you ignore
those requests?

28:12.670 --> 28:13.932
Because we thought
she was fine.

28:14.020 --> 28:16.415
Perhaps the stress
of the blatant discrimination

28:16.503 --> 28:17.579
you showed Mrs. Allen

28:17.667 --> 28:18.995
contributed
to her complications.

28:19.083 --> 28:21.181
Objection, Your Honor.
Motion to strike from the record.

28:21.268 --> 28:23.028
The prosecution's
inflammatory remarks

28:23.115 --> 28:24.447
which have no relevance
in this case

28:24.534 --> 28:25.730
and no place in the courtroom.

28:25.817 --> 28:28.253
Sustained, and, Callan,
I am warning you...

28:28.341 --> 28:30.387
- Your Honor, may I?
- Your Honor?

28:34.037 --> 28:36.690
What happened to my patient
was a tragedy,

28:37.065 --> 28:39.784
and it was one of the biggest
failures of my career,

28:39.871 --> 28:41.417
but it was an accident.

28:41.505 --> 28:43.464
I was put on this earth
to help people.

28:43.552 --> 28:45.293
That's what I was
supposed to do.

28:45.490 --> 28:47.440
Please don't take that
away from me.

29:06.139 --> 29:07.421
What's she doing here?

29:07.516 --> 29:09.538
Since neither of you
will tell me what's going on,

29:09.626 --> 29:10.905
maybe you'll talk
to each other.

29:10.993 --> 29:12.767
Please have a seat,
Congresswoman.

29:13.022 --> 29:14.036
What are you going to do?

29:14.123 --> 29:15.639
Sit here.
Referee.

29:15.819 --> 29:17.546
Hope that one of you
tells me something

29:17.634 --> 29:18.750
that will help
Jeremy's case,

29:18.837 --> 29:21.139
because right now
it is not looking good.

29:21.428 --> 29:23.405
Jeremy, your freedom
depends on this.

29:23.493 --> 29:25.044
Did you attack
the refinery

29:25.132 --> 29:27.049
to punish your mom
for her stance on Big Oil?

29:27.136 --> 29:29.397
No. She knows why.

29:29.485 --> 29:31.530
Jeremy, I have no idea
why you did this.

29:31.618 --> 29:32.647
Please let me in.

29:32.744 --> 29:35.046
How could you be
so clueless?

29:36.077 --> 29:37.233
I'm protecting you.

29:37.321 --> 29:39.764
I am not the one who was
supposed to be doing that.

29:39.888 --> 29:41.559
- Youare the parent.
- Honey, what?

29:41.647 --> 29:43.866
I would never want you
to go to jail for me.

29:43.954 --> 29:45.632
I told you that this
would happen,

29:45.763 --> 29:47.257
that someone
would find out.

29:47.360 --> 29:48.786
Things don't stop
being true

29:48.874 --> 29:50.919
just because you don't want
to accept them, Mom.

29:51.091 --> 29:53.944
- And now it's too late.
- It's not.

29:54.032 --> 29:56.139
Jeremy, I still have to present
the rest of our case.

29:56.227 --> 29:58.427
Tell me the story, and I will
tell you if we can use it.

29:59.569 --> 30:02.249
Ed Parker blackmailed me
into attacking that refinery.

30:02.850 --> 30:04.615
That would have been good
to know from the beginning.

30:04.702 --> 30:06.481
- Keep going.
- He made me trust him,

30:06.569 --> 30:08.307
and I told him something
that I shouldn't have

30:08.394 --> 30:11.217
about my mom.
He hates her... her politics.

30:11.850 --> 30:13.372
Ed Parker wanted
to make a statement

30:13.460 --> 30:14.434
about the environment

30:14.522 --> 30:15.911
and embarrass you
at the same time.

30:15.999 --> 30:18.148
He threatened me and told me
that he would ruin your life

30:18.235 --> 30:20.428
if I didn't do exactly
as I was told.

30:22.186 --> 30:24.030
Objection.
This is desperate fiction.

30:24.118 --> 30:26.247
Why would Mr. Parker
blackmail the defendant?

30:26.335 --> 30:28.835
Your Honor, we have proof
of that blackmail.

30:28.923 --> 30:30.944
Submitting copies
of said text messages.

30:31.032 --> 30:33.774
The defense will provide
the "why" if we may continue.

30:33.942 --> 30:35.022
No further questions.

30:35.110 --> 30:36.764
The People will cross-examine
Mr. Moore

30:36.901 --> 30:39.129
after the grand mystery
is revealed.

30:39.217 --> 30:41.038
Mr. Moore,
you may step down.

30:41.633 --> 30:43.452
Ms. Lopez, you may continue.

30:43.858 --> 30:46.076
The defense
calls Valerie Moore.

30:46.164 --> 30:47.170
Objection.

30:47.258 --> 30:49.044
Congresswoman Moore
is not on the witness list.

30:49.131 --> 30:50.611
Both of you, approach.

30:54.998 --> 30:56.754
Your Honor,
Ms. Moore's testimony

30:56.842 --> 30:59.061
will further call into question
Ed Parker's credibility.

30:59.149 --> 31:00.793
Impeachment?
This is extraordinary.

31:00.881 --> 31:02.231
Your Honor,
my client's relationship

31:02.318 --> 31:04.146
with his mother is fraught.

31:04.287 --> 31:06.051
Under no circumstance
would I call her

31:06.139 --> 31:07.824
unless her testimony
was relevant.

31:07.912 --> 31:09.928
I'll allow it
to get to the truth,

31:10.016 --> 31:12.115
but no bait and switch.
You understand?

31:12.203 --> 31:13.545
Understood, Your Honor.

31:15.820 --> 31:18.240
Ms. Moore,
you may take the stand.

31:23.175 --> 31:25.427
What information did
Ed Parker use

31:25.515 --> 31:27.178
to blackmail
the defendant?

31:30.647 --> 31:32.631
I have bipolar disorder.

31:33.285 --> 31:35.371
I was diagnosed
when I was 18.

31:35.459 --> 31:37.266
It was frightening.

31:37.615 --> 31:39.598
And it took some time
to figure it out,

31:39.686 --> 31:41.183
but I was mostly well

31:41.318 --> 31:43.011
by the time
that Jeremy was born,

31:43.098 --> 31:45.613
and I've managed it
successfully

31:45.701 --> 31:47.159
with medication
for decades.

31:47.247 --> 31:49.320
Why is this information
so damaging?

31:49.408 --> 31:52.237
Most people don't understand
mental illness. They're scared.

31:52.475 --> 31:54.990
If the news got out,
my career would be over.

31:55.107 --> 31:58.460
So I didn't tell anyone,
not even my son,

31:58.548 --> 32:01.199
who stood a good chance
of inheriting the condition,

32:01.287 --> 32:04.373
but then he started
experiencing symptoms.

32:07.007 --> 32:08.975
And I pretended
that I didn't know why.

32:09.647 --> 32:11.293
But he's so much braver
than me.

32:11.381 --> 32:13.717
He went to a doctor
and was diagnosed,

32:13.805 --> 32:15.895
and that's how he found out.

32:16.279 --> 32:18.910
Honey, I know it looks like I
was putting my work before you,

32:18.998 --> 32:22.615
but I was...
so ashamed,

32:22.833 --> 32:24.615
and I was trying
to protect you.

32:24.835 --> 32:26.010
People look at you
differently

32:26.097 --> 32:27.280
when they know
you have an illness.

32:27.367 --> 32:29.779
If I could,
I would take it all back.

32:31.755 --> 32:34.395
Ed Parker is the real criminal.

32:34.483 --> 32:37.332
He is an extremist
who wants to control people.

32:37.420 --> 32:38.912
Well, not my family.

32:40.537 --> 32:41.928
Not anymore.

32:42.154 --> 32:43.678
Nothing further, Your Honor.

32:44.326 --> 32:45.899
Mr. Berger?

32:46.600 --> 32:47.901
No, Your Honor.

32:48.076 --> 32:50.513
We ask that the court receive
the defense exhibits,

32:50.600 --> 32:52.600
and we will be arguing
for a duress defense.

32:52.688 --> 32:55.647
Objection. You can't just tack
duress on like a side dish.

32:55.743 --> 32:57.851
I would have included it,
but my client did not tell me

32:57.938 --> 32:59.840
he was blackmailed
because he was under duress.

32:59.928 --> 33:01.334
It is the reason
he is not guilty.

33:01.422 --> 33:03.177
Duress requires
an imminent threat.

33:03.265 --> 33:05.746
Ed Parker didn't hold a gun
to Jeremy Moore's head

33:05.834 --> 33:07.443
when your client attacked
the refinery.

33:07.530 --> 33:10.340
Your Honor, social media
is the weapon.

33:10.428 --> 33:12.326
When the public
disagrees with someone,

33:12.414 --> 33:16.146
that person is subjected to
threats of ruin and death

33:16.234 --> 33:18.068
by cowards who hide
behind anonymity.

33:18.156 --> 33:20.324
It is a new kind
of imminent threat.

33:20.412 --> 33:23.309
The defendant was
forced to commit this crime.

33:23.397 --> 33:25.381
My client is not guilty.

33:25.469 --> 33:27.621
I will take that
into submission, counsel.

33:27.709 --> 33:29.904
You'll have my decision
in the morning.

33:34.201 --> 33:35.279
The People have shown

33:35.367 --> 33:37.863
that Dr. Gipson failed
to perform his sworn duty,

33:37.951 --> 33:39.754
knowing that it would result

33:39.842 --> 33:42.045
in the harm or death
of Joy Allen.

33:42.305 --> 33:45.522
The defendant's
deep-seated bias, his racism,

33:45.610 --> 33:46.923
led to his indifference

33:47.011 --> 33:49.623
as to whether
Joy Allen lived or died,

33:49.967 --> 33:51.162
and by failing to act,

33:51.250 --> 33:54.522
he elevated her death
from tragedy to murder.

33:55.490 --> 33:57.449
We cannot perpetuate injustice

33:57.536 --> 33:59.834
by allowing the law
to protect inaction

33:59.922 --> 34:02.621
when action would mean
that Joy Allen was here today

34:02.779 --> 34:05.592
with her husband
and her newborn son.

34:06.084 --> 34:08.779
I ask you to find
Dr. Timothy Gipson

34:08.928 --> 34:10.943
guilty of Joy Allen's murder.

34:25.639 --> 34:28.076
Finally come
to take over my case?

34:30.108 --> 34:32.036
Best lawyer
in L.A. is my son,

34:32.148 --> 34:33.951
and he chooses
not to represent me.

34:34.039 --> 34:35.538
You were running
a high-stakes card game?

34:35.625 --> 34:37.858
It was a poker night.
I would have invited you,

34:37.946 --> 34:39.139
except you're
so damn busy.

34:39.226 --> 34:40.897
You got in sideways
with the Armenians?

34:40.985 --> 34:43.239
Come on.
You spoke to Flannery.

34:43.328 --> 34:44.880
He loves to make a mountain

34:44.969 --> 34:46.376
- out of nothing.
- What happened, Dad?

34:46.463 --> 34:48.648
You didn't go to Addison's place
for a card game. I know that much.

34:48.735 --> 34:51.272
I walked in.
There she was, laying...

34:51.360 --> 34:53.061
It's never your fault.

34:53.482 --> 34:55.928
It's a mistake.
It's a misunderstanding.

34:56.016 --> 34:57.443
You talk your way
out of everything.

34:57.531 --> 34:59.647
- Watch your tone with me.
- Or what?

35:00.787 --> 35:02.315
What, Dad?

35:02.608 --> 35:06.936
Just once, take responsibility
for your situation one time.

35:07.024 --> 35:09.397
I didn't do anything.

35:10.927 --> 35:12.725
I don't believe you.

35:15.537 --> 35:17.178
You don't wanna tell me,
fine.

35:17.266 --> 35:18.843
But if you have any hope
of saving yourself,

35:18.930 --> 35:20.280
you will tell Amy Quinn
everything,

35:20.367 --> 35:21.632
or you will never
walk out of here.

35:21.719 --> 35:26.545
Yeah? Well, that's between
me and my lawyer, isn't it?

35:40.759 --> 35:42.287
All rise.

35:52.529 --> 35:53.897
"As to count 1,

35:54.016 --> 35:56.498
"a violation
of Penal Code 187,

35:56.586 --> 35:58.787
"murder in the second degree
of Joy Allen,

35:58.875 --> 36:03.014
"the jury finds the defendant,
Dr. Timothy Gipson...

36:03.903 --> 36:05.123
not guilty."

36:05.534 --> 36:07.545
Oh, no.

36:11.218 --> 36:12.553
Thank you,
ladies and gentlemen.

36:12.641 --> 36:14.426
This concludes
your jury service.

36:14.704 --> 36:17.061
Dr. Gipson,
you are free to go.

36:29.830 --> 36:33.850
Niles, sorry
doesn't even begin...

36:37.059 --> 36:39.920
Guilty or not,
I wake up tomorrow.

36:41.246 --> 36:43.422
Joy's side of the bed
is still empty.

36:44.847 --> 36:48.373
I just didn't want her pain
to have been for nothing.

36:54.070 --> 36:55.463
I failed.

36:55.551 --> 36:58.772
Niles... the look
in his eye.

36:58.973 --> 37:01.764
He'd never say it,
but that broke him.

37:01.996 --> 37:04.350
All you can offer Niles
is space.

37:04.605 --> 37:07.067
People don't like
to admit prejudice is real

37:07.155 --> 37:09.481
unless they can pinpoint
some bigoted boogeyman

37:09.569 --> 37:11.379
behind a curtain,
but the truth is,

37:11.547 --> 37:13.184
sometimes it's invisible.

37:13.337 --> 37:14.926
It doesn't make it
any less dangerous.

37:15.014 --> 37:18.325
Amazing, a man can
do something unforgiveable,

37:18.413 --> 37:20.583
and the law gives him
armor and a shield.

37:20.671 --> 37:23.239
And sometimes the law
hands a judge

37:23.327 --> 37:25.770
an outdated definition
of "duress."

37:25.858 --> 37:27.543
Get creative.

37:27.631 --> 37:30.182
Getting creative
is what had me sweating

37:30.270 --> 37:32.011
in front of the Commission
on Judicial Performance

37:32.098 --> 37:32.989
last year.

37:33.077 --> 37:35.692
Lola, you can't help
but see it through your lens.

37:35.780 --> 37:37.659
That's what got you
on the bench.

37:37.747 --> 37:41.194
That's why Sherri hasn't
set your chambers on fire.

37:41.812 --> 37:43.317
Yet.

37:44.411 --> 37:46.481
Try harder.
What's beneath the case?

37:46.569 --> 37:49.180
- What's invisible?
- A broken family,

37:49.268 --> 37:51.333
smack in the middle
of a political minefield.

37:51.421 --> 37:52.489
Okay, well,
that's a start.

37:52.577 --> 37:53.731
Now get creative.

37:53.819 --> 37:56.895
Why am I always burdened
with the creativity?

37:56.983 --> 37:59.520
I would be happy to give
someone else that platform.

38:00.645 --> 38:01.872
Platform.

38:01.960 --> 38:03.129
That's it.

38:03.217 --> 38:04.278
Good talk.

38:04.543 --> 38:05.661
Go good!

38:10.333 --> 38:13.379
I find the defendant
guilty of all charges.

38:13.467 --> 38:15.466
There's no doubt, Mr. Moore,
that you were pressured

38:15.553 --> 38:17.575
into committing your crimes,
but that pressure

38:17.663 --> 38:20.270
does not meet the criteria
for the duress defense.

38:20.358 --> 38:22.970
I do, however, believe
you deserve leniency.

38:23.065 --> 38:25.543
As such, I will exercise
my discretion

38:25.639 --> 38:28.051
by reducing those charges
to misdemeanors.

38:28.239 --> 38:32.114
You are sentenced to probation
and six months house arrest.

38:32.202 --> 38:34.639
I would like that house
to be yours, Congresswoman,

38:34.725 --> 38:36.466
if you will accept
the court's request.

38:36.572 --> 38:39.231
Mr. Moore, the only time
you'll be allowed out

38:39.325 --> 38:42.262
is to complete 300 hours
of community service

38:42.350 --> 38:44.903
with a reputable
eco organization,

38:44.991 --> 38:46.833
where you will explore
making change

38:46.921 --> 38:48.512
withoutbreaking the law.

38:48.600 --> 38:50.083
Thank you,
Your Honor.

38:50.840 --> 38:53.270
Lastly, Mr. Parker,
please stand.

38:53.358 --> 38:56.426
Your hubris may not
allow you to see it,

38:56.514 --> 38:58.754
but you lied under oath...
A felony.

38:58.842 --> 39:00.614
I've had
an arrest warrant signed.

39:00.702 --> 39:03.137
F-For me? Your Honor,
I am not the criminal here.

39:03.225 --> 39:04.618
That's for another court
to decide.

39:04.706 --> 39:07.098
Thank you, Deputy Watkins.
You may take him into custody,

39:07.186 --> 39:09.661
and, Mr. Parker,
I have no doubt

39:09.749 --> 39:11.817
that further investigation
into your actions

39:11.905 --> 39:13.317
will lead to more charges.

39:13.405 --> 39:15.363
Fighting for the Earth...

39:15.507 --> 39:17.786
Also means fighting
for its people.

39:17.925 --> 39:19.448
We're adjourned.

39:22.048 --> 39:24.050
Thank you.
You're welcome.

39:24.178 --> 39:25.020
<i>Folks, wait one second.</i>

39:25.108 --> 39:27.590
<i>One second.
Stay right there.</i>

39:36.762 --> 39:39.176
This isn't an appeal
of today's verdict,

39:39.287 --> 39:41.965
but it is an appeal
to the public.

39:45.938 --> 39:47.520
<i>♪ I can hear the bells ♪</i>

39:47.608 --> 39:50.590
DDA Mark Callan and I

39:50.678 --> 39:53.246
to learn the facts of this case
and the underlying issue

39:53.334 --> 39:56.590
that racial bias, whether
conscious or unconscious,

39:56.678 --> 39:58.059
can kill people.

39:58.147 --> 40:00.062
Had Dr. Gipson just listened,

40:00.150 --> 40:01.278
Joy wouldn't have...

40:01.366 --> 40:03.208

40:03.296 --> 40:04.887
This is a public health crisis

Serena Williams.

40:12.565 --> 40:13.793

You still think race

40:35.855 --> 40:37.909
Oh, it matters at times.

40:37.997 --> 40:40.690
I'm just not convinced
it's relevant in this case.

40:40.842 --> 40:43.432
Look, I admit I was
surprised at that verdict,

40:43.520 --> 40:46.393
but I don't think
I disagree.

40:46.481 --> 40:47.910
I'm sorry
if that offends you.

40:47.998 --> 40:50.520
You don't need to apologize
for your opinion

40:50.608 --> 40:52.131
when it's thoughtful.

40:52.429 --> 40:53.856
Sadly, I'm not surprised

40:53.944 --> 40:56.629
at the verdict
or that you feel that way.

40:58.543 --> 40:59.762
Judge Carmichael,

41:00.022 --> 41:02.154
if I have questions

41:02.242 --> 41:04.504
about gaining
another perspective

41:04.592 --> 41:07.441
just from time to time,
might that be all right?

41:08.613 --> 41:10.082
Depends on the question.

41:10.170 --> 41:11.777
But... yes.

41:11.865 --> 41:13.410
That would be all right.

41:19.282 --> 41:22.121
<i>♪ Hold your head high ♪</i>

41:22.217 --> 41:26.265
<i>♪ Hold your head high ♪</i>

41:37.440 --> 41:39.496
I had to come back
here

41:39.584 --> 41:42.402
and love on this
Los Angeles winter weather.

41:42.816 --> 41:44.051
Thanks for meeting me.

41:44.139 --> 41:46.035
Oh, I'm happy
to get out of the office.

41:46.123 --> 41:48.668
I didn't clear
that press conference

41:48.756 --> 41:50.277
- with the boss.
- Ooh. Fallout?

41:50.365 --> 41:52.371
Choi doesn't like
surprises,

41:52.459 --> 41:54.488
but Gipson and his lawyer
aren't happy, so...

41:55.910 --> 41:58.793
Did Amy Quinn
see you on TV?

41:58.950 --> 42:00.856
Did she think
you looked handsome?

42:00.944 --> 42:03.465
I don't think my little
TV appearance redeemed me.

42:03.553 --> 42:05.559
Hey, if Vic loses,
maybe you can pardon him

42:05.647 --> 42:07.380
- when you get elected governor.
- Not happening.

42:07.467 --> 42:08.777
I don't know,
but the congresswoman

42:08.864 --> 42:10.311
- thinks she owes you.
- Doesn't matter.

42:10.398 --> 42:12.153
The congresswoman is taking
a break from politics.

42:12.240 --> 42:13.488
You are just getting
started.

42:13.576 --> 42:15.660
I have never been
a political animal.

42:15.748 --> 42:17.144
I don't think you can
avoid it anymore.

42:17.231 --> 42:18.637
You think Jeremy
would be free

42:18.725 --> 42:20.316
if that stayed
a jury trial?

42:20.404 --> 42:22.114
I don't think he'd be at home
with his mother,

42:22.201 --> 42:23.402
that's for sure.

42:23.611 --> 42:24.917
I'm glad
the switch happened.

42:25.005 --> 42:26.512
That case needed
a fresh lens,

42:26.600 --> 42:28.606
unsullied
by the political shenanigans

42:28.694 --> 42:31.629
- in need of me.
- Hey, amen to that.

42:31.717 --> 42:33.168
Hmm.

42:34.400 --> 42:38.970
I still can't believe
you drive across the city

42:39.276 --> 42:41.527
from downtown
through traffic to the beach

42:41.615 --> 42:43.051
for avocado toast.

42:43.139 --> 42:44.967
<font color=#ffff00>You </font>made the same drive.

42:45.107 --> 42:49.416
Hey, I came for the scenery
and the company.

42:49.713 --> 42:51.988
I think you're secretly addicted
to all-day breakfast.

42:52.115 --> 42:53.566
I don't think that's a secret.

42:53.691 --> 42:56.096
I still don't think avocado toast
should be a thing, though.

42:56.192 --> 42:57.496
Then why you keep
eating mine?
