(cheering and shouting)

01:58.501 --> 02:01.081
You owe me 300 euros.

02:04.459 --> 02:05.919
Hah!

02:06.542 --> 02:08.961
- Cheeky boy.
- You were... Wow.

02:09.042 --> 02:11.752
- Did you see the face on that nun?
- Yeah. And that old guy.

02:11.876 --> 02:13.496
I thought he was going to faint.

02:13.584 --> 02:15.544
He will when he finds his Rolex gone.

02:15.626 --> 02:18.456
Come back to mine and we'll get high.

02:18.584 --> 02:21.214
It don't get better than that.
That was a high.

02:21.334 --> 02:24.174
Yeah, but that was only an appetiser.

02:27.251 --> 02:29.081
You can do better than me.

03:01.459 --> 03:03.919
MAN: Special Agent Briar,
they're ready for you.

03:19.251 --> 03:22.001
Are you familiar with Deep Net
cryptocurrency transactions?

03:22.084 --> 03:23.884
I don't bank online.

03:23.959 --> 03:26.079
Right. You're a field guy.

03:27.167 --> 03:29.497
Your last op, Anbar,

03:29.584 --> 03:32.134
you were tasked surveillance,

03:32.209 --> 03:33.789
but you did a little more than that.

03:34.126 --> 03:37.786
Without clear visual evidence,
you broke cover to take down six suspects

03:37.917 --> 03:41.247
who you alone had ascertained
were carrying concealed explosives.

03:41.376 --> 03:43.286
I'm curious, are you saying you knew

03:43.417 --> 03:47.037
what they were carrying underneath
their clothing before engaging?

03:47.126 --> 03:48.626
Oh, yeah.

03:48.751 --> 03:50.581
Like I could tell you, Tom...

03:51.417 --> 03:53.247
got tighty whities on, right?

03:55.501 --> 03:59.831
But in the process, you exposed
your key informant, Fatima Hamza.

04:00.001 --> 04:02.961
Two years building her trust,

04:03.126 --> 04:05.496
infiltrating the terror network, wasted.

04:05.626 --> 04:07.246
- It was a calculated risk.
- Really?

04:07.376 --> 04:10.326
Because your Baghdad CO describes you
as reckless, insubordinate

04:10.459 --> 04:12.459
and irresponsible toward human assets.

04:12.542 --> 04:13.782
You recognise that description?

04:13.834 --> 04:16.423
No, but I recognise an asshole
when I see one.

04:18.250 --> 04:19.630
Tom, a minute.

04:30.334 --> 04:32.924
I stuck my neck out
trying to get you this position.

04:33.001 --> 04:35.001
- You have to play the game.
- Oh, yeah.

04:35.126 --> 04:37.496
And you know how good I am at that.

04:41.834 --> 04:43.544
Welcome to Paris.

04:52.126 --> 04:53.876

05:57.709 --> 06:00.039
Merci. Merci.

06:15.459 --> 06:17.249
That.

06:17.334 --> 06:19.964
And as ordered...

06:20.042 --> 06:22.922
two Japanese passports.

06:23.917 --> 06:25.667
How about 800?

06:25.751 --> 06:30.751
Baba, that's a genuine Reverso. I could
get two grand for that on George V.

06:30.834 --> 06:32.044
So sell it there.

06:32.876 --> 06:34.246
Nine.

06:35.209 --> 06:37.079
And I throw in Lacoste shirts.

06:38.417 --> 06:40.747
Your crocodiles are sewn on backwards.

06:45.792 --> 06:46.832
(chuckles)

06:59.917 --> 07:02.877
You must have enough now, Michael,
to go back home.

07:04.167 --> 07:06.077
Nothing to go back to.

07:06.209 --> 07:08.039
Then, forward.

07:08.126 --> 07:09.916
Everyone has to have a dream.

07:10.917 --> 07:15.077
I'm gonna put myself through med school,
find a cure for Alzheimer's.

07:15.209 --> 07:17.459
Last week, wasn't it Parkinson's?

07:17.542 --> 07:18.582
Really?

07:22.584 --> 07:25.504
You have a good evening... Dr Michael.

The French picture is back to front.

14:47.917 --> 14:52.167
We got lucky. Unrelated surveillance of
their Finance Minister five blocks away.

14:52.292 --> 14:55.582
- The same guy shows up in our shot.
- Are we sharing this with the French?

14:55.667 --> 14:59.077
I think the less they know about us
spying on them, the better, don't you?

14:59.167 --> 15:01.247
It could jeopardise our entire operation.

- Same payphone?
- Yeah?

15:50.042 --> 15:51.602
What are we waiting for? Let's get him.

we can get 24 hours with him off site.

24:44.876 --> 24:47.576
- What? No.
- What the fuck are you doing in Paris?

24:47.709 --> 24:49.879
- I just...
- What organisation do you work for?

24:50.209 --> 24:53.039
Your manifesto says
this is the first strike.

- I'm not a terrorist.

24:58.917 --> 25:01.377

- You didn't look inside?
- Yeah, I looked inside.

25:11.751 --> 25:14.041
- You didn't see the bomb?
- There was just crap in there.

25:14.167 --> 25:17.417
It was a wig, a toy. I put it back.
I swear to God. I'm really sorry.

25:17.501 --> 25:19.081
- I didn't... I'm sorry.
- Shut up!

25:19.251 --> 25:21.131
Focus!

25:21.209 --> 25:23.249
I didn't know what was in that bag.

25:23.417 --> 25:26.997
But you ran and you made me chase you,
and innocent people do not run.

25:27.084 --> 25:29.504
You were coming after me.
Have you seen yourself?

25:36.751 --> 25:41.921
What I need you to understand
is this does not look good for you.

25:42.751 --> 25:46.711
One phone call and you're on a phantom
flight to the middle of nowhere,

25:46.834 --> 25:48.794
off the grid.

25:48.876 --> 25:51.456
You would not be missed.

25:53.751 --> 25:56.131
It wasn't my bag.

25:56.209 --> 25:57.879
I swear to God.

25:58.917 --> 26:00.627
Whose was it?

26:00.959 --> 26:02.879
Er... this girl.

26:03.209 --> 26:06.669
- Describe her.
- OK. She was pretty.

26:06.751 --> 26:09.081
She had brown hair and a blonde wig.

26:09.251 --> 26:13.251
She had a bag. Her body language made me
think there was something valuable in it.

26:13.334 --> 26:14.964
Two pounds of Semtex. Well done.

26:16.542 --> 26:19.382
That's her phone. That was in the bag.
It rang and I answered it.

26:19.709 --> 26:21.419
Some French guy, he called her Zoe.

26:21.501 --> 26:23.581
- Where'd you steal it?
- Pigalle.

26:23.917 --> 26:26.287
If I go to surveillance cameras,
I see you stealing it?

26:26.417 --> 26:29.497
- I only work blind spots so no cameras.
- Yeah.

26:29.626 --> 26:31.576
Because you don't have a record in Paris.

26:31.709 --> 26:33.919
No thefts, no pick-pockets,
no stolen bags.

26:34.001 --> 26:38.001
- Just this motherfucking terrorist money.
- That is from selling the stuff I steal.

26:38.084 --> 26:39.834
- Who do you sell it to?
- I have a guy.

26:39.917 --> 26:41.877
- Where?
- In Barbès.

26:42.709 --> 26:44.539
You must be really good.

26:44.709 --> 26:47.499

53:06.959 --> 53:09.789
Zoe, right? It was your bag, wasn't it?

53:09.876 --> 53:13.206
You remember? In Pigalle. It was your bag.

53:13.542 --> 53:15.882
With the bomb in it that he stole?

53:19.667 --> 53:20.667
Sshh!

53:20.834 --> 53:22.084
(coughing)

53:22.167 --> 53:24.207
Now, Zoe, I don't have time for this,
all right?

53:24.334 --> 53:26.964
But you're gonna tell me where
the next bomb's gonna be.

53:27.084 --> 53:28.754
I need to know now!

53:28.834 --> 53:30.754
I don't wanna hurt you.

53:37.001 --> 53:40.001
Look at me. Look at me.

53:40.584 --> 53:43.134
I've seen this a thousand times.

53:43.209 --> 53:46.919
I take one look at you and I know
you're not a terrorist. You're being used.

53:47.001 --> 53:49.541
They probably gave you a story,

53:49.626 --> 53:51.706
told you
you're the only one they could trust,

53:51.834 --> 53:54.214
that they'll look after you,
but they lied, Zoe.

53:54.292 --> 53:55.832
You're in a lot of trouble.

53:57.376 --> 53:59.246
No one was meant to die.

54:01.459 --> 54:03.079
Who built that bomb?

54:04.334 --> 54:06.794
Jean. I only knew Jean.

54:06.876 --> 54:09.166
Jean. Where is he?

54:09.251 --> 54:12.461
The guy that gave her that bomb
is at 14, Rue Kleber. Send backup.

54:12.584 --> 54:16.544
Briar, we're a fucking surveillance team.
Your job was to find Mason.

54:16.876 --> 54:18.746
<i>- They're both with me.</i>
- You what?

54:19.084 --> 54:21.714
KAREN: <i>Briar, bring them in.</i>
- No time. Heading there now.

54:22.042 --> 54:23.542
You are way off the reservation here.

54:23.959 --> 54:26.789
If you do this, you are on your own,
do you understand?

54:26.876 --> 54:28.166
Understood.

54:34.167 --> 54:37.377
- So we're taking her to the cops, right?
- Not yet.

54:37.709 --> 54:39.589
That wasn't the deal.
We turn her in, I'm clear.

54:39.876 --> 54:41.326
You wanna go? Go.

54:41.417 --> 54:43.457
I can't cos the cops still think I did it.

54:43.542 --> 54:46.422
I did everything you asked.
I thought we were a team.

54:46.501 --> 54:48.081
Sorry, man. You're not Ivy League.

54:48.417 --> 54:49.787
You fucking played me.

54:49.917 --> 54:53.127
All that shit about your past, was that
a lie too? You even from Belize?

54:53.459 --> 54:55.039
No, Connecticut, actually.

55:07.292 --> 55:08.712
(yells)

55:08.792 --> 55:10.632
- I fucking trusted you, man.
- Hey. Shut up.

55:10.959 --> 55:12.459
(shouts)

55:13.542 --> 55:14.882
Get down!

55:24.126 --> 55:25.206
Shit!

55:30.792 --> 55:32.332
You OK?

55:32.417 --> 55:33.827
- Are you hit?
- No.

55:34.001 --> 55:36.251
I'm OK too, thanks.
Who the fuck are these guys?

55:36.376 --> 55:38.826
Who are they, Zoe? Was that Jean's crew?

55:39.167 --> 55:41.707
No, Jean is not like that.
He would never hurt anyone.

55:41.792 --> 55:44.002
He gave you a bomb.
Zoe, we don't have time for this.

55:44.126 --> 55:46.206
Are they planning another bomb?

55:46.292 --> 55:48.962
No, we were not planning anything
and we only had one bomb.

55:49.084 --> 55:51.634
Well, what are they doing?
Give me something. Come on.

55:51.959 --> 55:54.209
Jean said we were fighting back
against the fascists,

55:54.334 --> 55:57.214
- that we were trying to disrupt them.
- How?

55:57.292 --> 55:59.712
I was supposed to bomb
an empty office building.

55:59.834 --> 56:01.884
- Right.
- But I changed my mind.

56:01.959 --> 56:04.379
- And then he came along.
- You can't put this all on me.

56:04.501 --> 56:07.131
- It was your bag.
- I was going to throw it in the river.

56:55.334 --> 56:56.634
Where?

56:56.709 --> 56:58.629
First floor.

56:59.459 --> 57:01.379
Please don't hurt him.

57:36.334 --> 57:37.634
(sobs)

57:40.001 --> 57:41.461
Get her out of here.

57:42.501 --> 57:43.881
Come here.

57:46.667 --> 57:48.077
(sobs)

58:57.167 --> 58:59.037
So you first met him at a demonstration?

59:00.292 --> 59:03.132
- You know why he chose you?
- Chose?

59:03.209 --> 59:05.709
- No, we were in love.
- Zoe, listen to me.

59:05.792 --> 59:08.832
When a man is an undercover cop,
relationships are not what they seem.

59:08.917 --> 59:10.417
No, it's not true.

59:10.542 --> 59:13.542
I believed in him and I believed
in what we had together.

59:13.667 --> 59:15.417
That was his skill.

59:15.751 --> 59:17.461
He had to gain your trust.

59:18.667 --> 59:20.537
Have you done this?

59:21.709 --> 59:26.999
Lie, screw, fuck, use people
to get what you want?

59:27.084 --> 59:28.794
Yeah, he's done that and more.

59:30.251 --> 59:31.831
It's what he does for a living.

59:31.917 --> 59:34.667
Hey, I don't need judgement from you.

59:50.209 --> 59:52.039
BRIAR:
<i>They're cops, Karen. It's a RAPID team.</i>

59:52.167 --> 59:54.747
<i>They planned the bomb to go off
in the Nation Pure offices.</i>

59:54.876 --> 59:56.326
To pin it on a mosque?

59:56.459 --> 59:58.959
Karen, someone's playing chess
with the city right now.

59:59.084 --> 01:00:00.714
<i>Briar, this is out of control.</i>

01:00:01.042 --> 01:00:03.002
I have to give this
to French Intelligence, OK?

01:00:03.334 --> 01:00:04.714
Yeah, who are you gonna talk to?

01:00:04.876 --> 01:00:07.456
<i>Victor Gamieux. He was my contact
back in Libya. He's OK.</i>

01:00:07.542 --> 01:00:09.382
And what about my assets?

01:00:09.459 --> 01:00:12.879
- He's gonna want us to turn them over.
- A pick-pocket and a bomb mule?

01:00:13.251 --> 01:00:14.791
<i>What do you care?</i>

01:00:16.209 --> 01:00:17.999
- I don't.
<i>- Good.</i>

01:00:18.376 --> 01:00:19.916
I'll set a pickup.

01:00:54.042 --> 01:00:55.542
D'accord?

01:01:07.417 --> 01:01:08.667
Victor.

01:01:09.876 --> 01:01:12.746
The bomb was made
by an undercover police officer.

01:01:13.084 --> 01:01:15.214
His name was Pascal Fibbert.

01:01:15.334 --> 01:01:19.254
He was found hanging last night,
but he was most likely strangled.

01:01:19.584 --> 01:01:23.084
Victor, you have a terrorist conspiracy
in the heart of the police force.

01:01:23.417 --> 01:01:26.287
The mosque was a setup.
There's something going on.

01:01:26.917 --> 01:01:28.577
And you have evidence?

01:01:28.917 --> 01:01:32.207
I have a witness. Currently in the company
of one of my agents.

01:01:32.584 --> 01:01:35.834
- The other American?
- We're prepared to hand them over to you.

01:01:36.167 --> 01:01:37.727
But can you get them into safe custody?

01:01:41.542 --> 01:01:47.502
Witness handover needs to be off the books
until I know how far the rot spreads.

01:01:47.876 --> 01:01:50.666
They're near the Stalingrad Square,
in Aubervilliers.

01:01:51.042 --> 01:01:52.922
OK, call him. I'll arrange a pickup.

01:01:53.001 --> 01:01:55.041
Tell him the safe word is Mike Alpha.

01:01:55.167 --> 01:01:56.787
Thank you, Victor.

01:02:01.209 --> 01:02:04.539
Gamieux's hand-picking his men.
Safe word Mike Alpha.

01:02:06.376 --> 01:02:08.036
Thank you for coming to me.

01:02:08.376 --> 01:02:09.536
You owe me dinner.

01:02:11.251 --> 01:02:12.921
(two more gunshots)

01:02:51.042 --> 01:02:52.672
Mike Alpha?

01:03:32.876 --> 01:03:34.376
(mobile phone rings)

01:03:35.376 --> 01:03:37.126
Allo?

01:03:40.709 --> 01:03:42.419
OK, à toute à l'heure.

01:04:12.417 --> 01:04:13.787
(horn blares)

01:04:37.667 --> 01:04:38.667
Agh!

01:04:39.626 --> 01:04:41.286
(horn blares)

01:04:49.084 --> 01:04:50.294
(tyres screech)

01:05:20.209 --> 01:05:21.829
(panting)

01:05:35.292 --> 01:05:36.752
Come on, Michael.

01:05:37.751 --> 01:05:40.131
TV: <i>While the Bastille Day procession
gets underway,</i>

01:05:40.251 --> 01:05:42.461
<i>protesters have opened up
a new front of attack.</i>

01:05:42.792 --> 01:05:45.212
<i>The hashtag, Attack The Bank,
has gone viral</i>

01:05:45.292 --> 01:05:47.962
<i>in a highly co-ordinated online campaign.</i>

01:05:48.084 --> 01:05:50.384
<i>In unprecedented numbers,</i>

01:05:50.459 --> 01:05:52.749
<i>demonstrators are surrounding
the National Bank of France.</i>

01:06:01.459 --> 01:06:02.829
(protesters chanting)

01:06:25.667 --> 01:06:27.207
- Where is she?
<i>- We can't locate her.</i>

01:06:27.542 --> 01:06:29.002
All the devices have gone dark.

01:06:29.084 --> 01:06:31.504
She went to meet Gamieux
this morning to arrange a pickup.

01:06:31.834 --> 01:06:33.294
<i>His guys just tried to kill us.</i>

01:06:33.459 --> 01:06:35.829
He's Head of French Intelligence.
Do you know what...?

01:06:36.167 --> 01:06:37.957
Karen's dead, Luddy, all right?

01:06:38.959 --> 01:06:40.249
She's dead.

01:06:40.626 --> 01:06:43.206
Gamieux is dirty
and we need to find out what he's doing.

01:06:43.334 --> 01:06:45.044
He is protecting the Bank of France.

01:06:45.376 --> 01:06:47.666
He's put RAPID cops in charge.
They've gone to Code Five.

01:06:48.042 --> 01:06:51.332
Right, so he's put RAPID cops
to protect the bank

01:06:51.459 --> 01:06:53.249
from the riots that he started.

01:06:53.584 --> 01:06:55.834
It's all about the distraction, right?

01:06:55.917 --> 01:06:58.997
These guys aren't terrorists.
They're thieves.

01:06:59.376 --> 01:07:01.876
- What are you talking about?
<i>- How much money's in that vault?</i>

01:07:02.001 --> 01:07:03.711
It's the French National Reserve.

01:07:04.042 --> 01:07:06.712
- And we just gave them the keys.
<i>- This is fantasy, Briar.</i>

01:07:07.084 --> 01:07:08.844
It is impossible to walk out
with that money.

01:07:08.917 --> 01:07:10.717
The eyes of the fucking city
are on that bank.

01:07:10.917 --> 01:07:13.457
<i>And I order you to come in now
and hand over...</i>

01:07:14.792 --> 01:07:16.042
Briar.

01:07:16.417 --> 01:07:17.537
Briar!

01:07:28.917 --> 01:07:30.577
(klaxons blare)

01:08:09.626 --> 01:08:11.536
(keypad bleeps)

01:08:13.376 --> 01:08:15.326
I'll be on the comms. Listen in.

01:08:15.459 --> 01:08:17.879
- And stay here till it's over.
- You're ditching us?

01:08:18.792 --> 01:08:22.131
- You won't be any use to me.
- Why are you doing this?

01:08:22.626 --> 01:08:25.496
Well, let's just say
I can't stand thieves.

01:08:27.626 --> 01:08:29.626
They killed a good CIA officer.

01:08:29.751 --> 01:08:31.791
She deserved better.

01:08:31.876 --> 01:08:33.416
I mean, what are you doing?

01:08:33.542 --> 01:08:35.631
Going in alone, no plan, no backup?

01:08:36.251 --> 01:08:39.711
You read my report.
I'm reckless and irresponsible.

01:08:42.126 --> 01:08:43.916
(chanting and shouting)

01:09:33.376 --> 01:09:34.666
J'y arrive.

01:09:36.167 --> 01:09:37.457
(electricity buzzes)

01:09:47.751 --> 01:09:48.831
(bleeping)

01:10:04.042 --> 01:10:06.252
- (whistles)
- Christophe.

01:11:04.709 --> 01:11:06.079
Hey.

01:11:47.917 --> 01:11:51.417
- He's trapped.
- He told us to wait here.

01:11:52.501 --> 01:11:55.711
- This isn't our fight.
- Four people died because of us.

01:11:56.792 --> 01:11:58.422
What can we do? There's only two of us.

01:12:00.876 --> 01:12:02.576
No, there's a lot more.

01:12:16.501 --> 01:12:18.211
(angry shouting)

01:12:19.876 --> 01:12:21.036
À bas la police!

01:12:25.292 --> 01:12:27.882
- Bande de fascistes!
- They just need a push.

01:12:36.709 --> 01:12:37.709
Zoe!

01:12:40.542 --> 01:12:42.712
- Come on!
- Bande de chiens!

01:12:43.542 --> 01:12:46.172
(protesters roar)

01:13:00.542 --> 01:13:02.212
(machine gun clicks)

01:13:04.501 --> 01:13:06.081
(mob roars)

01:13:26.084 --> 01:13:27.584
(heavy pounding)

01:13:29.167 --> 01:13:30.787
(mighty roar)

01:13:34.584 --> 01:13:35.964
(chanting)

01:13:36.042 --> 01:13:37.082
(man shouts)

01:13:50.042 --> 01:13:51.042
Briar!

01:14:29.167 --> 01:14:30.827
Put your hands up.

01:14:33.584 --> 01:14:34.834
Now!

01:14:37.834 --> 01:14:39.424
(automatic gunfire)

01:15:22.501 --> 01:15:24.081
(wheels squeaking)

01:15:39.959 --> 01:15:41.079
(grunts)

01:16:08.001 --> 01:16:09.211
Non!

01:16:11.251 --> 01:16:12.921
(yells)

01:16:18.376 --> 01:16:19.626
(yells)

01:16:22.209 --> 01:16:23.709
(grunts)

01:16:31.209 --> 01:16:32.749
- (mobile phone rings)
- Oui.

01:17:03.126 --> 01:17:05.456
- Michael, can you hear me?
- Briar.

01:17:05.584 --> 01:17:09.384
A man from the safe house is coming your
way with half a billion in his pocket.

01:17:09.459 --> 01:17:11.329
- What?
<i>- Listen to me. It's not gold.</i>

01:17:11.417 --> 01:17:14.077
It's digital currency.
It's in his chest pocket, on a hard drive.

01:17:14.417 --> 01:17:16.827
(protestors chanting)

01:17:34.417 --> 01:17:35.667
(shouting)

01:17:40.334 --> 01:17:41.754
Putain!

01:17:42.959 --> 01:17:44.709
Banquiers enculés!

01:18:00.209 --> 01:18:02.959
Where are you? I know it's you.

01:18:03.292 --> 01:18:04.382
Where are you?

01:18:05.501 --> 01:18:06.961
(woman shouts)

01:18:12.251 --> 01:18:13.331
Salope!

01:18:14.542 --> 01:18:16.132
(gunshots)

01:18:16.209 --> 01:18:17.539
(protestors go silent)

01:18:22.626 --> 01:18:23.706
Show your face!

01:18:59.126 --> 01:19:01.036
BRIAR:
<i>Don't move, Michael.</i>

01:19:03.751 --> 01:19:05.001
Give it to me.

01:19:26.376 --> 01:19:27.376
Give it to me.

01:19:31.042 --> 01:19:32.542
The drive.

01:19:34.417 --> 01:19:35.417
Descendez-le.

01:19:39.126 --> 01:19:40.876
Police! Police!

01:19:41.209 --> 01:19:42.039
(panicked shouting)

01:19:42.209 --> 01:19:43.669
Allez! Allez!

01:20:10.376 --> 01:20:12.496
- You OK?
- Yeah.

01:20:16.251 --> 01:20:19.041
- Where's Michael?
- I don't know.

01:20:30.251 --> 01:20:31.831
Come on.

01:20:42.584 --> 01:20:44.924
<i>Director Gamieux has been praised
for his work</i>

01:20:45.001 --> 01:20:47.631
<i>bringing down the gang
of corrupt police officers.</i>

01:20:47.792 --> 01:20:49.582
<i>The suspected bomber is still at large</i>

01:20:49.917 --> 01:20:52.167
<i>and police are watching
all ports and airports,</i>

01:20:52.292 --> 01:20:54.212
<i>asking the public to remain vigilant.</i>

01:21:40.042 --> 01:21:41.752
(door closes)

01:22:09.709 --> 01:22:11.249
Sergei?

01:22:12.001 --> 01:22:14.631
- Fuck.
- Don't worry, Michael.

01:22:14.751 --> 01:22:16.631
I'm here alone.

01:22:16.709 --> 01:22:18.629
I'm not here to arrest you.

01:22:19.751 --> 01:22:22.041
I'm here to make a deal.

01:22:22.834 --> 01:22:25.584
It was a passport you wanted?

01:22:29.167 --> 01:22:33.377
I'll give you tickets to Brazil
and $100,000 cash

01:22:33.459 --> 01:22:35.169
for the hard drive.

01:22:35.251 --> 01:22:37.171
For half a billion?

01:22:37.834 --> 01:22:41.544
Trust me, you're not in
a position to negotiate.

01:22:54.376 --> 01:22:56.246
You got the cash?

01:23:01.417 --> 01:23:03.877
This way. Follow me.

01:23:14.751 --> 01:23:16.541
Where are we going?

01:23:16.709 --> 01:23:18.789
Just out through there.

01:23:34.792 --> 01:23:35.962
Get in there.

01:23:43.792 --> 01:23:48.292
Drop your gun... or I shoot your friend.

01:23:49.709 --> 01:23:50.879
Who, this guy?

01:23:56.042 --> 01:23:58.132
Now what?

01:24:20.292 --> 01:24:21.962
(coughs)

01:24:23.917 --> 01:24:25.577
(gasps)

01:24:26.501 --> 01:24:28.461
I didn't know you were gonna shoot me.

01:24:28.542 --> 01:24:30.712
You're still alive. Come on.

01:24:48.417 --> 01:24:49.787
(exhales)

01:24:54.709 --> 01:24:56.209
Drive.

01:24:56.292 --> 01:24:57.792
I gave it to Gamieux.

01:25:05.626 --> 01:25:08.826
So where do I go from here?
I didn't even get the money.

01:25:08.959 --> 01:25:10.879
Are the CIA gonna reimburse me?

01:25:11.001 --> 01:25:12.961
- Guess you gotta get a job.
- A job?

01:25:13.084 --> 01:25:14.794
The CIA got anything going?

01:25:14.876 --> 01:25:17.246
- Yeah, you can clean the cars.
- Like swept for bombs?

01:25:17.376 --> 01:25:19.246
No, buddy. Soap and water.

01:25:19.334 --> 01:25:21.134
- What about surveillance?
- I don't think so.

01:25:21.251 --> 01:25:22.631
- The mailroom?
- No.

01:25:22.792 --> 01:25:25.502
- Come on, man, I got skills.
- I should have shot you in the face.
