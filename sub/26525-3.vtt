WEBVTT

00:01.784 --> 00:04.526
My name is Kara Zor-El.
I'm from Krypton.

00:04.569 --> 00:07.007
I'm a refugee on this planet.

00:07.050 --> 00:09.313
I was sent to Earth
to protect my cousin.

00:09.357 --> 00:11.315
But my pod
got knocked off course.

00:11.359 --> 00:13.317
And by the time I got here,

00:13.361 --> 00:17.017
my cousin had
already grown up
and become... Superman.

00:18.235 --> 00:20.194
I hid who I really was
until one day

00:20.237 --> 00:23.719
when an accident
forced me to reveal
myself to the world.

00:23.762 --> 00:27.418
To most people,
I'm a reporter
at CatCo Worldwide Media.

00:27.462 --> 00:29.855
But in secret,
I work with my adopted sister

00:29.899 --> 00:32.858
at the DEO to protect
this planet I call my home

00:32.902 --> 00:35.209
from anyone
that means to cause it harm.

00:36.210 --> 00:38.734
I am Supergirl.

00:39.735 --> 00:41.519
Previously
onSupergirl...

00:41.563 --> 00:43.130
As I step down,

00:43.173 --> 00:45.915
I put my full confidence
in Vice President Baker

00:45.958 --> 00:47.612
as Commander-in-Chief.

00:47.656 --> 00:50.180
The climate towards
the aliens is changing.

00:50.224 --> 00:52.617
But I cannot fight with you.
I'm sorry.

00:52.661 --> 00:56.404
Those roaches want to be us,
Agent Jensen.

00:56.447 --> 00:57.796
They came for our planet.

00:57.840 --> 01:00.103
And your job
is to protect that.

01:00.147 --> 01:03.237
Your assistance
will be greatly noted.

01:03.280 --> 01:04.455
Earth first.

01:22.952 --> 01:25.781
It's a Kryptonite
contamination alarm.

01:25.824 --> 01:27.739
Find out where.

01:27.783 --> 01:29.567
Supergirl, we've got
a Kryptonite alert

01:29.611 --> 01:31.569
-somewhere in National City.
-Director Danvers...

01:31.613 --> 01:33.223
You're gonna need to stay back
until we figure out
what we're dealing with.

01:33.267 --> 01:34.572
-Alex.

01:34.616 --> 01:38.489
It's not just National City.
It's everywhere.

01:40.187 --> 01:42.319
Supergirl, do you read me?

01:42.363 --> 01:45.496
Earth first! Earth first!
Earth first!

01:50.240 --> 01:51.502
-Alex.
-J'onn!

01:51.546 --> 01:53.287
The atmosphere was just seeded
with Kryptonite.

01:53.330 --> 01:55.376
-Look, I'm not sure
how it happened,

01:55.419 --> 01:56.986
but Supergirl was flying back
from D.C.

01:57.029 --> 01:58.466
and now,
I can't get her on her comms.

01:58.509 --> 02:00.163
She's way out
in the atmosphere, J'onn,

02:00.207 --> 02:02.861
and the last known signal
from her was in Nevada.

02:02.905 --> 02:04.036
I'm on it.

02:16.397 --> 02:17.833
Come on, Supergirl.

02:17.876 --> 02:19.226
Where are you?

02:20.357 --> 02:21.576
I've got her.

02:24.579 --> 02:28.322
-She's falling fast.
-Come on, J'onn,
where are you?

02:28.365 --> 02:30.324
-He's too far.
-He'll make it.

02:30.367 --> 02:32.239
If he doesn't,
with the Kryptonite radiation,

02:32.282 --> 02:34.066
the impact will kill her.

02:35.372 --> 02:37.766
Come on. Get our girl.

03:00.310 --> 03:01.659
I've got you.

03:03.270 --> 03:04.836
Yes!

03:09.928 --> 03:12.757
Alex, she's in bad shape.
I'm coming in hot.

03:23.290 --> 03:27.250
Oh, no, no. We need to get her
to a clean room, stat.

03:27.294 --> 03:29.252
It won't do any good.
The entire atmosphere

03:29.296 --> 03:31.646
was irradiated in an instant.

03:31.689 --> 03:33.648
-Nowhere is safe.
-We have to do something.

03:33.691 --> 03:35.432
Yellow sun
radiation should help.

03:35.476 --> 03:37.129
Yeah, okay, let's do it.

03:42.134 --> 03:43.745
What could do
something like this?

03:43.788 --> 03:45.486
The lead dispersal device.

03:45.529 --> 03:47.575
The one that we used
to knock out the Daxamites?

03:47.618 --> 03:50.273
Yeah, unlikely. That device
is here under lock and key.

03:50.317 --> 03:53.842
Only a DEO Agent
could... Jensen.

03:54.886 --> 03:56.584
What about Astra's
anti

03:56.627 --> 03:57.933
You have
an anti

03:57.976 --> 03:59.587
Winn adapted it
for moments just like this.

03:59.630 --> 04:01.284
It can leech the Kryptonite
out of her system.

04:01.328 --> 04:02.764
-Vault 97.
-I'll get it.

04:02.807 --> 04:06.681
Activate the sun lamps. Okay.

04:06.724 --> 04:11.294
-We had a security breach.

04:11.338 --> 04:13.122
The President's attackers,
they escaped custody,

04:13.165 --> 04:16.691
and one of our DEO recruits,
he helped them.

04:16.734 --> 04:20.521
J'onn, I can fix this.
I can fix her.

04:21.478 --> 04:23.654
I am not losing
my sister today.

04:26.570 --> 04:27.658
I've got it.

04:30.487 --> 04:31.488
She's seizing.

04:34.839 --> 04:37.233
-It just needs more time.

04:39.235 --> 04:41.498
What kind of person
is capable of doing this?

04:43.021 --> 04:44.806
Now, in each
and every one of you,

04:44.849 --> 04:49.332
there is a light, a spirit
that cannot be snuffed out.

04:49.376 --> 04:53.205
That won't give up.
I will never abandon you.

04:53.249 --> 04:55.686
And I am doing everything
I can to fight for you

04:55.730 --> 04:59.342
but I can't do it alone.
I need your help again.

04:59.386 --> 05:01.562
I need you to hope.

05:01.605 --> 05:02.954
Yeah, sure.

05:02.998 --> 05:05.522
We can all leap tall buildings
in a single bound.

05:05.566 --> 05:07.524
You will remember
that you can all be...

05:07.568 --> 05:10.092
And we can punch him
into the middle of next week.

05:10.571 --> 05:12.573
I was watching that.

05:12.616 --> 05:13.791
More like hate-watching it.

05:13.835 --> 05:16.054
George.
Dad, I think
it's quite enough.

05:16.098 --> 05:18.056
Show that speech
over and over again

05:18.100 --> 05:20.058
like it was
the Gettysburg Address.

05:20.102 --> 05:23.061
Project Maniac was weeks ago.

05:23.105 --> 05:26.108
-It's "Myriad."
-Oh, that's right.

05:26.151 --> 05:28.023
Project Myriad.

05:28.589 --> 05:30.547
Stupid name.

05:30.591 --> 05:32.549
And who
was responsible?

05:32.593 --> 05:34.725
Other roaches
from her home planet.

05:34.769 --> 05:37.293
Pete, we don't talk like that
in this house.

05:37.337 --> 05:39.426
No, it's fine.
I hear it at school sometimes.

05:39.469 --> 05:42.080
What's the problem?
Just saying that,

05:42.124 --> 05:46.171
you know, aliens are resilient
like cockroaches.

05:46.781 --> 05:47.956
A planet may die,

05:47.999 --> 05:50.741
but they survive
and infest someone else's.

05:50.785 --> 05:52.308
-Dad!

05:53.483 --> 05:54.919
Supergirl's family invades

05:54.963 --> 05:57.748
our planet
with the power of gods.

05:57.792 --> 06:00.142
And all of us little people
are just supposed to sit back,

06:00.185 --> 06:01.578
relax and have hope?

06:01.622 --> 06:02.884
Is that it?

06:02.927 --> 06:06.453
Meanwhile, our president
offers them all amnesty?

06:07.236 --> 06:08.368
Amnesty.

06:09.456 --> 06:10.935
So, you tell me, Georgie,

06:10.979 --> 06:13.851
how deep
does this conspiracy go?

06:18.987 --> 06:21.816
Ben, I think, maybe,
you should drive
your dad to work.

06:26.473 --> 06:30.607
Firing up that alien factory
across the street today.

06:30.651 --> 06:31.956
Two dozen known alien worlds,

06:32.000 --> 06:33.958
and Nth metal
is just the strongest material

06:34.002 --> 06:35.525
brought to Earth
from any one of them, by far.

06:35.569 --> 06:37.788
It's... Gotta think
of the good it can do.

06:37.832 --> 06:40.051
Cars, skyscrapers...

06:40.095 --> 06:42.358
It doesn't even have a vowel.

06:42.402 --> 06:44.708
It's supposed
to hold up skyscrapers?

06:46.014 --> 06:49.800
We lost the Luthor Corporation
contract last week.

06:49.844 --> 06:53.195
-I had to shutter
two blast furnaces.

06:53.238 --> 06:56.154
Taking on statue commissions
just to make ends meet.

06:56.198 --> 06:58.722
What if you
retrofitted the factory

06:58.766 --> 06:59.810
to process Nth metal?

06:59.854 --> 07:00.985
You could
retrain your employees.

07:01.029 --> 07:03.161
This town was built on steel.

07:03.205 --> 07:04.641
American steel.

07:04.685 --> 07:06.513
You rip out that foundation,

07:06.556 --> 07:08.515
and everything
will crumble around it.

07:08.558 --> 07:10.342
You mark my words.

07:10.386 --> 07:12.997
People thought textiles would
be the end of modern society,

07:13.041 --> 07:14.346
but the Industrial Revolution,

07:14.390 --> 07:16.523
it created
unprecedented opportunities--

07:16.566 --> 07:18.568
I'm not one
of your students, Ben.

07:18.612 --> 07:20.178
And I'll remind you,

07:20.222 --> 07:22.529
it was called a "revolution"
for a reason.

07:22.572 --> 07:24.531
And I'll also remind you,

07:24.574 --> 07:25.880
that steel
is what paid for that

07:25.923 --> 07:27.664
fancy college
education of yours,

07:27.708 --> 07:28.926
that you seem
to only wanna use

07:28.970 --> 07:31.538
when you wanna
condescend to your old man.

07:31.581 --> 07:33.670
Worth every penny. Right, Dad?

07:33.714 --> 07:35.106
Not so much.

07:36.891 --> 07:38.762
Listen. Hey, hey.

07:39.720 --> 07:41.678
You're the strongest
guy I know.

07:41.722 --> 07:43.027
You're stronger
than Nth metal.

07:43.071 --> 07:44.681
Your workers are strong, too.
I just...

07:44.725 --> 07:45.682
You're gonna
figure something out.

07:45.726 --> 07:47.249
It's gonna be okay.

07:48.555 --> 07:49.991
You'll see.

07:50.034 --> 07:52.733
Come on, come on.
Come on, let's go stop them.

07:56.998 --> 07:58.695
We've gotta
shut down those aliens.

07:58.739 --> 08:00.480
-Stop those roaches!
-Hurry up!

08:05.920 --> 08:07.487
Stop that truck!

08:10.751 --> 08:11.882
Get down!

08:11.926 --> 08:13.405
What's going on here?

08:13.449 --> 08:14.885
Thack! Thack, what the hell
is going on here?

08:14.929 --> 08:16.800
We're not gonna let them
kill this town, Ben.

08:16.844 --> 08:18.410
No!
-We won't let them.

08:18.454 --> 08:19.455
Wait! No, no, no, no.

08:21.936 --> 08:23.546
Dad! Dad, you gotta stop this.

08:23.590 --> 08:25.200
They're your employees.
They'll listen to you.

08:26.593 --> 08:27.768
-Dad!
-Please!

08:27.811 --> 08:29.247
We are workers, same as you.

08:30.901 --> 08:32.250
He's got spikes!

08:33.600 --> 08:35.210
No! No! No, no, no.

08:35.253 --> 08:37.604
Guys, guys, listen to me!
It's just the way he looks!

08:37.647 --> 08:39.301
It's just the way he looks!
It's okay, it's okay.

08:39.344 --> 08:41.521
-I come in peace!
-Okay, let's just
all calm down.

08:41.564 --> 08:42.522
And be reasonable.

08:47.831 --> 08:48.876
I didn't mean to!

08:48.919 --> 08:51.400
I didn't mean to!
I didn't mean to!

08:56.013 --> 08:58.189
Someone call an ambulance!

09:06.371 --> 09:10.288
Hey, stay with me.
Stay with me.

09:20.385 --> 09:22.562
Is it Supergirl?

09:22.605 --> 09:24.738
No. Agent Alex Danvers. FBI.

09:24.781 --> 09:27.436
Supergirl got called away.
Afraid you're stuck with me.

09:28.045 --> 09:30.004
Is it... is it bad?

09:30.047 --> 09:31.179
Not half as bad as what you

09:31.222 --> 09:32.702
and your friends
did to that Bravik.

09:32.746 --> 09:34.704
What? No, no, no.
No, I was just--

09:34.748 --> 09:36.227
I was trying to help

09:36.271 --> 09:38.012
but our guys are just angry.
They are scared, they're--

09:38.055 --> 09:40.101
-My family,

09:40.144 --> 09:42.843
we own the steel factory
across the way.

09:42.886 --> 09:44.627
The workers,
they're very good people.

09:44.671 --> 09:46.673
Oh, they are lucky people.

09:46.716 --> 09:50.372
Because Supergirl
went very, very easy on them.

09:50.415 --> 09:52.461
Keep it clean,
change the bandage often,

09:52.504 --> 09:53.854
and stay out of trouble.

09:53.897 --> 09:56.770
Went very, very easy on them?

10:01.949 --> 10:04.038
The FBI are supposed
to work for the people.

10:04.081 --> 10:05.779
Indeed, we work
for the American people

10:05.822 --> 10:07.041
and per
the Alien Amnesty Act--

10:07.084 --> 10:08.782
Alien. Alien?

10:10.261 --> 10:12.873
The man your workers
just attacked is an American.

10:12.916 --> 10:15.223
He has just as much right
to work here safely as you.

10:15.266 --> 10:17.660
He impaled my son
with a freak spike.

10:17.704 --> 10:18.748
I think you're talking about

10:18.792 --> 10:19.923
his biological
defense mechanism.

10:19.967 --> 10:22.622
Biological what?
It was an assault!

10:22.665 --> 10:23.623
What do you call this?

10:27.452 --> 10:28.323
Hey.

10:28.366 --> 10:29.585
Supergirl was just attacked

10:29.629 --> 10:31.979
with stolen alien weaponry
on Fig and 8th.

10:32.022 --> 10:33.284
Winn said that
she's okay, but...

10:33.328 --> 10:35.983
All right.
Let's move it out! Let's go.

10:36.026 --> 10:37.941
How are you doing, buddy?
Are you all right?

10:39.943 --> 10:42.729
Why in the world is the FBI
working with Supergirl?

10:42.772 --> 10:44.078
The real question is,

10:44.121 --> 10:46.471
why are
they working against us?

10:50.954 --> 10:53.130
See if we can do something
for the children's hospital.

10:53.174 --> 10:55.524
Maybe a fundraising
gala would help?

10:55.567 --> 10:57.091
Ms. Luthor,
could I have a word with you?

10:57.134 --> 10:59.267
Please. It's about
my father's company,

10:59.310 --> 11:01.008
Lockwood Family Steel.

11:01.051 --> 11:05.447
Wait, wait, it's okay.
Hi, how can I help you?

11:05.490 --> 11:07.449
Hi, I am so sorry
to ambush you like this.

11:07.492 --> 11:09.103
You're not exactly
an easy person to reach.

11:09.146 --> 11:11.453
Well, that's by design, but...

11:11.496 --> 11:13.107
Lockwood Steel.
You're Peter Lockwood's son?

11:13.150 --> 11:17.024
Yeah,
I'm Ben Lockwood and, uh...

11:17.067 --> 11:21.028
Okay. For 20 years,
Lockwood Steel has been used

11:21.071 --> 11:23.944
in some of Luthor Corp's
most successful products.

11:23.987 --> 11:25.336
Well, yeah, that is true,

11:25.380 --> 11:27.469
but in case you weren't aware,
we are rebranding.

11:27.512 --> 11:29.297
And in order for L-Corp
to remain successful,

11:29.340 --> 11:30.646
it has to stay current.

11:30.690 --> 11:32.517
Steel made
with Nth metal is the future.

11:32.561 --> 11:35.216
Shouldn't
the past matter, too?

11:35.259 --> 11:37.479
Look at it this way. This is
an opportunity for your father

11:37.522 --> 11:39.655
to modernize the plant,
and his work force.

11:39.699 --> 11:42.353
Well, yeah, but those machines
cost millions of dollars.

11:42.397 --> 11:45.487
Your father is a businessman,
and a good one.

11:45.530 --> 11:47.010
Just because
it's the march of progress,

11:47.054 --> 11:48.751
doesn't mean
he has to be left behind.

11:56.063 --> 11:57.542
Manifest Destiny.

11:57.586 --> 12:00.241
That was the name of America's
unstoppable push west

12:00.284 --> 12:03.287
during the mid 1800s.
It's "progress..."

12:09.903 --> 12:11.295
Ladies and gentlemen,

12:11.339 --> 12:13.080
I'm gonna go
off script a little bit.

12:13.950 --> 12:17.737
Progress. What do
we think of progress?

12:17.780 --> 12:20.304
Without continual
growth and progress,

12:20.348 --> 12:23.917
notions such as improvement,
achievement, and success,

12:23.960 --> 12:25.657
have no meaning.

12:25.701 --> 12:27.224
That's not me.
That's Ben Franklin.

12:27.268 --> 12:28.269
But my point is,

12:28.312 --> 12:29.574
ever since the beginning,

12:29.618 --> 12:32.577
our leaders had been
obsessed with progress.

12:32.621 --> 12:34.492
But can you tell me
what's so great about it?

12:34.536 --> 12:36.059
Well, the discovery
of the New World,

12:36.103 --> 12:37.321
that's progress, right?

12:37.365 --> 12:39.062
For Spain and Columbus.

12:39.106 --> 12:40.411
No so much
for the Native Americans.

12:40.455 --> 12:43.458
President Marsdin's
Alien Amnesty Act.

12:44.285 --> 12:45.895
Is that progress?

12:45.939 --> 12:48.811
I think it's progress, right?
Of course, it is.

12:50.117 --> 12:53.120
But I know some Americans
who don't think so.

12:53.163 --> 12:57.167
In fact, I know some Americans
who are worse off for it.

12:58.168 --> 12:59.909
So, what's my point?

12:59.953 --> 13:02.303
The next time someone tells
you how great progress is,

13:02.346 --> 13:05.436
I want you to stop a moment,
I want you to think

13:05.480 --> 13:09.701
about who
paid the price for it.

13:10.659 --> 13:13.183
Okay, get out of here,
get out of here.

13:21.844 --> 13:24.934
The fallout continues
for Biomax Technology

13:24.978 --> 13:26.980
exposed last month
for touting a fraudulent,

13:27.023 --> 13:28.329
and possibly fatal design...

13:28.372 --> 13:31.158
Dad! What are you doing home?

13:32.246 --> 13:33.682
I shut it down.

13:34.857 --> 13:38.556
-Oh, not another blaster.
-Whole factory.

13:39.514 --> 13:40.863
What?

13:40.907 --> 13:43.300
He went to the bank
for the loan. They said no.

13:43.344 --> 13:45.128
Hell with them
and everyone else.

13:45.172 --> 13:48.001
Oh, God, Dad, um...

13:48.044 --> 13:51.874
-I am so sorry.
-Spare me.

13:51.918 --> 13:53.006
This is what happens

13:53.049 --> 13:54.094
when you're too soft,

13:54.137 --> 13:55.486
when you don't
stand up and fight.

13:55.530 --> 13:58.228
Fight... Dad, fight who?

13:58.272 --> 14:00.143
-You know who.
-The roaches.

14:00.187 --> 14:01.884
-George!
-George!

14:01.928 --> 14:02.972
Sorry.

14:03.016 --> 14:06.149
Okay, we might not have much,

14:06.193 --> 14:07.847
but we still have the house.
We can...

14:07.890 --> 14:10.327
We can get a second mortgage.
I'm gonna go talk to the bank.

14:10.371 --> 14:12.895
Talk. That's mostly
what you do, right?

14:12.939 --> 14:15.202
Talk, talk, talk.

14:15.245 --> 14:16.507
When what you should be doing,

14:16.551 --> 14:17.857
-is go out there--
-Hey.

14:17.900 --> 14:20.207
-And be a man.

14:20.250 --> 14:21.686
You're drunk.

14:25.212 --> 14:28.737
People of Earth,
do not be afraid.

14:28.780 --> 14:30.260
We come in peace.

14:30.304 --> 14:32.262
We have crossed a sea of stars

14:32.306 --> 14:33.785
in order to bring
you a new way...

14:33.829 --> 14:35.004
You were saying?

14:35.048 --> 14:36.484
...a better way.

14:45.972 --> 14:48.888
Oh! Look at that. Gin rummy.

14:48.931 --> 14:50.890
Okay, I'm 100%
sure you're cheating.

14:50.933 --> 14:54.241
Okay, so, what have we got?
This is maybe a week of food,

14:54.284 --> 14:55.416
maybe two if we ration it.

14:55.459 --> 14:57.070
Yeah, but we're
running out of water.

14:57.113 --> 14:59.072
We have three,
maybe four days.

14:59.115 --> 15:00.725
Didn't we fill the tub?

15:00.769 --> 15:01.901
Yes.

15:03.424 --> 15:05.078
I think maybe we should leave.

15:05.121 --> 15:06.209
Leave?

15:06.253 --> 15:09.430
-This is our home.
-Yeah, it is,

15:09.473 --> 15:11.432
but it's quickly
running out of food and water.

15:11.475 --> 15:13.303
There is nowhere for us to go.

15:13.347 --> 15:14.652
The Daxamites
have set up checkpoints.

15:14.696 --> 15:16.437
Okay, then
we drive as far as we can.

15:16.480 --> 15:17.786
Maybe we can sneak
around the checkpoints,

15:17.829 --> 15:20.310
get to Coast City
but we have to try something.

15:20.354 --> 15:22.965
Try something? Yeah.

15:23.009 --> 15:26.012
How about we try this?
How about we stay

15:26.055 --> 15:27.970
and we fight for what's ours?

15:28.014 --> 15:31.278
This is our home, Ben.
We're not refugees.

15:31.321 --> 15:32.496
Dad, just wait here.

15:32.540 --> 15:34.107
Supergirl will come
and save us.

15:34.150 --> 15:35.717
No! No, she won't,

15:35.760 --> 15:38.807
because Supergirl is an alien
just like the invaders.

15:38.850 --> 15:42.202
And fight, Dad?
Fight with what?

15:42.245 --> 15:44.639
Because all we
have is right here.

15:44.682 --> 15:45.988
But you know what?
That's okay.

15:46.032 --> 15:48.295
Because we're a family.

15:48.338 --> 15:51.515
And we can come
together as a family.

15:51.559 --> 15:53.039
So, Dad,
you and Georgie get the bags.

15:53.082 --> 15:55.302
Lydia, ready the car.
I'll get the supplies.

15:55.345 --> 15:57.869
Hey, listen. We can do this.

16:15.539 --> 16:17.541
You're a good man,
Ben Lockwood.

16:19.761 --> 16:21.415
You're not so bad yourself.

16:26.768 --> 16:27.769
Go!

16:43.480 --> 16:45.743
-Get back!
-Go! Go!

16:55.101 --> 16:56.058
My bike!

16:56.102 --> 16:57.494
It's okay,
it's okay, it's okay.

17:08.114 --> 17:09.289
You're safe, now.

17:11.247 --> 17:12.466
They're gone...

17:29.700 --> 17:31.311
Next question.

17:31.354 --> 17:32.703
Um...

17:33.617 --> 17:35.793
All right,
long beard, go ahead.

17:35.837 --> 17:37.578
With the White House
renovations coming along,

17:37.621 --> 17:38.840
what color is the President

17:38.883 --> 17:40.450
intending to paint
the Blue Room?

17:40.972 --> 17:42.409
Blue.

17:42.452 --> 17:45.107
Can somebody please bring me
some Ibuprofen?

17:45.151 --> 17:46.978
I feel a bit
of a headache coming on.

17:47.022 --> 17:48.545
Mr. Olsen?

17:48.589 --> 17:50.112
Eve, can you make sure that
we have a reporter downtown

17:50.156 --> 17:52.071
for the bank robbery?

17:52.114 --> 17:53.159
-We can't expect Kara
to be everywhere, all over--

17:53.202 --> 17:55.509
This is Professor Lockwood
from NCU.

17:55.552 --> 17:57.293
Remember he asked
for five minutes?

17:57.859 --> 17:59.165
Right.

17:59.208 --> 18:01.602
Thank you for seeing me
on such short notice.

18:01.645 --> 18:03.821
Not a problem. I always
have time for our subscribers.

18:03.865 --> 18:05.649
-Please have a seat.
-Yeah.

18:06.476 --> 18:08.261
What can I help you with?

18:08.304 --> 18:10.089
Well, I'll just ask you.

18:10.828 --> 18:12.787
Why doesn't CatCo cover

18:12.830 --> 18:15.616
the impact
of extraterrestrial attacks

18:15.659 --> 18:17.618
on your average citizen?

18:17.661 --> 18:18.967
I'm surprised
to hear you say that

18:19.010 --> 18:20.447
because we
make our best effort

18:20.490 --> 18:22.971
to cover every side
of every story.

18:23.014 --> 18:25.713
And our coverage
on the Daxamite invasion

18:25.756 --> 18:28.672
and its aftermath
did win us a Pulitzer.

18:28.716 --> 18:30.848
I'm aware of that.
It's a very
beautifully-written article,

18:30.892 --> 18:34.025
but it treats the story
like it's over and done with.

18:34.069 --> 18:36.332
In my neighborhood,
people have lost their jobs,

18:36.376 --> 18:38.595
people have lost possessions,
people have lost...

18:40.423 --> 18:42.512
People have lost their homes.

18:42.556 --> 18:43.687
I'm sorry,
it's been a hell of a week.

18:43.731 --> 18:45.515
Let me just blow
your mind here, okay?

18:45.559 --> 18:47.126
Home owner's insurance.

18:47.169 --> 18:49.606
Did you know that it doesn't
actually cover alien invasion?

18:49.650 --> 18:50.955
-We did,

18:50.999 --> 18:52.131
because we covered that
in our business section.

18:52.174 --> 18:53.958
Right, and that's
all the way in the back,

18:54.002 --> 18:56.874
and it turns the common person
into numbers and statistics.

18:56.918 --> 18:58.398
I am here to tell you
that there are

18:58.441 --> 19:00.443
people behind these numbers.

19:00.487 --> 19:01.749
People who are hurting,

19:01.792 --> 19:04.186
and it would be
so very helpful

19:04.230 --> 19:06.275
if you would just tell
their stories, too.

19:06.319 --> 19:09.887
Professor Lockwood,
I appreciate your position,

19:09.931 --> 19:11.541
and I'm very sorry
for what you've been going--

19:11.585 --> 19:12.760
Did you hear
anything that I--

19:12.803 --> 19:14.414
This isn't about just me.

19:14.457 --> 19:17.460
Mr. Olsen, I have Lena Luthor
on the line for you.

19:19.419 --> 19:20.637
I have to cut this short,

19:20.681 --> 19:22.596
but you make some valid points

19:22.639 --> 19:24.554
and I'll bring them
up to Ms. Luthor.

19:24.598 --> 19:26.948
Lena Luthor.
What the hell does she
have to do with any of this?

19:26.991 --> 19:29.646
I'm not sure if you heard,
but she runs this place now.

19:31.039 --> 19:33.607
Ms. Luthor.
No, I'm not busy right now.

19:38.307 --> 19:39.308
Nativist.

19:40.527 --> 19:42.616
Term often used
in a derogatory fashion

19:42.659 --> 19:45.488
to describe those
who fear the other.

19:45.793 --> 19:47.316
Question for you.

19:47.360 --> 19:49.971
What's wrong with those who
wish to protect their homes

19:50.624 --> 19:51.973
from the outsiders?

19:53.627 --> 19:56.412
Well, America
is a country of immigrants.

19:56.456 --> 19:57.935
Yes, but that's always
been controversial.

19:57.979 --> 20:01.243
You see, in 1775,
Benjamin Franklin himself

20:01.287 --> 20:04.290
writes of his own fears
of immigrants whom he warned,

20:04.333 --> 20:07.945
"The immigrant will never
adopt our language or customs

20:07.989 --> 20:11.253
"any more than he could
acquire our complexion."

20:11.297 --> 20:13.516
Franklin was talking
about German immigrants

20:13.560 --> 20:15.953
back when America
was still a British colony.

20:15.997 --> 20:18.608
I don't see
how it applies to anything.

20:18.652 --> 20:21.611
I can see why this point
of view would be problematic,

20:21.655 --> 20:23.222
especially since
we are talking about

20:23.265 --> 20:24.571
human immigrants.

20:24.614 --> 20:26.268
Human immigrants, who,
for the past 200 years,

20:26.312 --> 20:28.618
made America great no matter
what their complexion.

20:28.662 --> 20:29.967
But now, we welcome immigrants

20:30.011 --> 20:31.621
not only
from outside our borders,

20:31.665 --> 20:33.797
but from beyond
our atmosphere.

20:33.841 --> 20:35.234
So, let me just ask you...

20:36.191 --> 20:40.674
How does
the human worker compete?

20:40.717 --> 20:42.241
Anyone?
How does the human worker

20:42.284 --> 20:44.155
compete against an alien

20:44.199 --> 20:46.854
who could lift
two tons of steel

20:46.897 --> 20:49.726
over its head
without even breaking a sweat.

20:49.770 --> 20:51.815
How does
the human worker compete

20:51.859 --> 20:53.643
against an alien
that can fly goods

20:53.687 --> 20:54.992
from one coast to the other,

20:55.036 --> 20:57.908
leaving our trucks
to rust away in the sand.

20:57.952 --> 20:59.649
Sorry, Professor,
what page are we on?

20:59.693 --> 21:02.261
Ben Franklin's fears
have come to pass.

21:02.304 --> 21:05.655
The modern immigrant
cannot assimilate

21:05.699 --> 21:06.874
and it's not
a question of desire,

21:06.917 --> 21:08.354
not a question of culture,

21:08.397 --> 21:12.401
it is a question of biology.
And from that context...

21:17.624 --> 21:18.929
From that context,

21:19.800 --> 21:21.192
I should be proud

21:21.236 --> 21:24.152
if you were
to call me a nativist.

21:26.720 --> 21:31.028
This isn't nativism.
It's xenophobia.

21:31.072 --> 21:33.204
I can't say
I'm surprised to hear that

21:33.248 --> 21:34.989
from someone
with your complexion.

21:47.088 --> 21:49.612
We've had another complaint
about your class, Ben.

21:49.656 --> 21:53.616
-Uh-oh. Millennials.
-Still.

21:53.660 --> 21:55.923
It sounds like your lectures
are extreme.

21:55.966 --> 21:59.100
Well, history is extreme,
truth is extreme.

21:59.143 --> 22:00.884
The classroom
isn't a safe space

22:00.928 --> 22:02.495
where everyone gets to hear
a fairy tale version
of the facts.

22:02.538 --> 22:04.018
And if students
can't handle perspectives

22:04.061 --> 22:06.281
that are different
than their own,

22:06.325 --> 22:08.762
then I don't know.
Maybe they don't belong here.

22:08.805 --> 22:10.807
The tenure board
would disagree.

22:13.070 --> 22:14.768
What are you saying?

22:14.811 --> 22:16.160
You've been
warned multiple times

22:16.204 --> 22:17.858
about the rhetoric
in your class.

22:18.859 --> 22:19.947
Now, we think you should

22:19.990 --> 22:22.123
take a leave
of absence without pay.

22:22.166 --> 22:23.646
You know what my family
is going through.

22:23.690 --> 22:24.821
I can't lose this job.

22:24.865 --> 22:26.519
You're passing
on your own prejudice

22:26.562 --> 22:27.998
to our students, Ben.

22:28.825 --> 22:31.262
We're a university,
a diverse one.

22:32.176 --> 22:37.138
Look, I'm sorry.
I've always liked you,

22:37.181 --> 22:38.661
but you brought
this on yourself.

22:38.705 --> 22:40.837
Dean Warren, look, I'm...

22:49.106 --> 22:50.543
I still can't believe
they haven't rounded up

22:50.586 --> 22:53.154
all those escaped convicts
from Albatross Bay.

22:53.197 --> 22:55.722
Honestly, after that
crazy goth chick

22:55.765 --> 22:57.419
tried frying them
all in their cells

22:57.463 --> 22:59.552
they probably deserve
a little furlough.

23:02.859 --> 23:04.078
Do you know this guy?

23:05.427 --> 23:08.822
Professor Lockwood?
Did you follow me here?

23:08.865 --> 23:09.910
Did you tattle
on me, Snowflake?

23:09.953 --> 23:11.477
What are you talking about?

23:11.520 --> 23:13.522
What am I talking about? Okay,
look, the complexion thing.

23:13.566 --> 23:14.915
I'm sorry, I apologize,

23:14.958 --> 23:17.831
but you had to get me fired?
This is my job.

23:17.874 --> 23:20.181
This is my livelihood.
I have a family!

23:20.224 --> 23:21.356
I didn't say anything,

23:21.400 --> 23:23.402
but I'm not
surprised someone did.

23:23.445 --> 23:26.927
Oh! Someone. Absolutely!
Because I was so out of line!

23:26.970 --> 23:28.842
Look at you. You are not okay.

23:28.885 --> 23:30.191
Okay, I don't need your pity--

23:30.234 --> 23:32.585
-Yeah.

23:33.586 --> 23:37.024
You're not an alien.
What are you doing here?

23:37.067 --> 23:39.940
It's karaoke night.
Let me ask you something.

23:39.983 --> 23:41.898
Should I do Beastie Boys?

23:41.942 --> 23:43.204
Do you think
I could pull that off?

23:43.247 --> 23:44.727
It's either that,
or Africaby Toto.

23:44.771 --> 23:46.076
That's not really not
what I'm talking about.

23:46.120 --> 23:47.774
I'm talking about you're human
and they are not,

23:47.817 --> 23:50.385
-and they are dangerous.

23:50.429 --> 23:51.734
Roaches.

23:52.561 --> 23:54.563
You don't know what
I'm talking about? She does.

23:55.956 --> 23:57.218
We don't touch aliens.

23:57.261 --> 23:58.698
Actually, you know what?
We don't touch anyone.

23:58.741 --> 24:00.221
So, why don't you
keep your hands to yourself

24:00.264 --> 24:01.918
and watch that mouth.

24:01.962 --> 24:03.964
Got it. Yeah. Earth traitor.

24:05.792 --> 24:06.923
Thanks for the backup.

24:06.967 --> 24:08.185
Yeah. Anytime.

24:08.229 --> 24:10.623
And for the record,
definitely Beastie Boys.

24:11.493 --> 24:12.755
I knew it.

24:14.453 --> 24:16.237
Excuse me, sir,
are you a concerned citizen?

24:16.280 --> 24:18.239
Hi, are you concerned
for your children?

24:18.282 --> 24:20.067
Hi, are you concerned that
Supergirl works with the FBI

24:20.110 --> 24:21.764
to round up political enemies?

24:21.808 --> 24:23.940
Hi, are you...
You just watch it.

24:23.984 --> 24:26.377
Sorry. My bad.
It's just an accident.

24:27.944 --> 24:29.772
Was it, though?

24:29.816 --> 24:32.775
-Whatever, dude.
-Okay. Walk away!

24:38.955 --> 24:40.479
I'll take one of those.

24:44.831 --> 24:46.789
Keep spreading
the good word, brother.

24:48.965 --> 24:50.184
Thank you.

25:00.847 --> 25:02.631
Oh, God. Not again.

25:07.070 --> 25:08.594
We're fine.

25:08.637 --> 25:10.465
But your dad...
What about him?

25:10.509 --> 25:13.337
I can't reach him.
I don't know where he is.

25:14.991 --> 25:16.645
I think I have an idea.

25:29.440 --> 25:32.966
Dad! Dad!

25:36.056 --> 25:38.058
Oh, my God. Dad!

25:38.624 --> 25:40.103
Dad!

25:40.147 --> 25:42.366
I'm gonna get you out of here.

25:42.410 --> 25:45.892
-You can't.
-Okay. You're right,
you're right.

25:45.935 --> 25:47.197
I'm gonna lift
this up, and you

25:47.241 --> 25:49.069
just slip off
out from under, okay?

25:49.112 --> 25:51.201
One, two, three!

25:51.245 --> 25:53.116
You're not Supergirl.

25:57.817 --> 26:00.689
No. No. I can do this, Dad.
I can get you out of here.

26:00.733 --> 26:02.082
I don't want you to.

26:03.083 --> 26:04.127
What?

26:05.955 --> 26:08.305
Dad, what did you just say?

26:08.349 --> 26:11.439
I came here on purpose, Ben.

26:12.832 --> 26:14.616
This is my home.

26:15.138 --> 26:16.662
And this steel...

26:17.967 --> 26:20.796
It's my life. Always has been.

26:21.754 --> 26:25.496
Now, its time is over,
and so is mine.

26:25.540 --> 26:27.586
Hey, hey, no.
Don't talk like that.

26:27.629 --> 26:28.978
You've got
a lot of years left.

26:29.022 --> 26:33.026
Maybe, but all the good ones
are long behind me.

26:34.636 --> 26:36.464
Remember
how I raised you, kid.

26:36.507 --> 26:40.120
-And you raise
Georgie the same way.
-Yes, sir.

26:40.163 --> 26:41.774
All right? You stand tall.

26:44.124 --> 26:48.258
Stand proud.
You're a Lockwood.

26:48.302 --> 26:52.436
You're human.
This planet belongs to you.

26:52.480 --> 26:55.135
Stand up and fight
for what's yours.

26:55.526 --> 26:56.615
Dad!

27:05.580 --> 27:07.147
I love you, Dad.

27:07.190 --> 27:11.499
Love you, too. Now, go, go.
Be the man I raised you to be.

27:43.749 --> 27:45.794
Sometimes,
things happen in life

27:45.838 --> 27:47.666
that we can't explain.

27:47.709 --> 27:53.193
Like a good man
being sent to an early grave.

27:53.236 --> 27:55.412
And when, not if,
these things happen,

27:55.456 --> 27:58.328
it can make us feel like
we want to give up.

27:58.372 --> 28:02.071
So, I'm very
happy to read to you,

28:03.072 --> 28:05.335
my father's favorite quote.

28:05.379 --> 28:07.729
Well, it's the only
quote he knew.

28:09.078 --> 28:10.558
Winston Churchill.

28:13.213 --> 28:14.605
"Never give in.

28:20.786 --> 28:22.570
Never give in.

28:24.224 --> 28:28.794
Never, in nothing,
great or small,

28:29.751 --> 28:31.013
large or petty,

28:31.057 --> 28:34.234
except in considerations
of honor and good sense.

28:34.277 --> 28:37.237
Never yield to force,

28:37.280 --> 28:39.369
or the apparently
overwhelming might

28:39.413 --> 28:41.763
of the enemy
that confronts you.

28:41.807 --> 28:44.287
Never. Never, ever

28:46.637 --> 28:47.769
give in."

29:01.478 --> 29:04.786
Well, you certainly
have some nerve coming here.

29:05.526 --> 29:07.615
I just wanted
to pay my respects.

29:07.658 --> 29:09.095
You had the chance
to give respect

29:09.138 --> 29:10.618
when I asked for help.

29:10.661 --> 29:13.273
But now, my dad's gone,
so, we don't need it.

29:13.316 --> 29:15.275
Okay, Ben, listen,
this isn't about your factory.

29:15.318 --> 29:17.277
This is about you
and your family

29:17.320 --> 29:19.192
and your father's workers.

29:20.193 --> 29:21.672
Times are tough,

29:21.716 --> 29:23.544
and I wanted to set up a fund
in your father's name--

29:23.587 --> 29:26.460
-Absolutely not.
-I'm just trying to help.

29:26.503 --> 29:29.158
You work with the things
that killed him.

29:29.202 --> 29:30.638
Nth metal, alien technology?

29:30.681 --> 29:32.031
I hear you got some new

29:32.074 --> 29:33.380
image device that lets them
hide what they are.

29:33.423 --> 29:35.730
That's really sick.

29:35.774 --> 29:38.298
I understand
that you're angry, okay?

29:38.341 --> 29:39.473
But you can't
go down this path.

29:39.516 --> 29:40.866
Blaming other people
for your problems,

29:40.909 --> 29:42.824
you will just end up
like my brother.

29:44.043 --> 29:46.001
They're not people.

29:48.787 --> 29:52.225
Nice speech, Benny.
What do you say,
you join us for a beer?

29:52.268 --> 29:53.704
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

30:03.018 --> 30:05.586
Hey, thanks for hiring us
to patch up your place, Ben.

30:05.629 --> 30:07.370
Jobs have been scarce
since the factory shut.

30:07.414 --> 30:08.894
Jobs are scarce
because of the roaches.

30:08.937 --> 30:09.938
Damn right.

30:11.418 --> 30:14.551
Remember what your old man
said, Ben? "Never give up."

30:14.595 --> 30:16.684
The fact that monstrosity
is still standing,

30:16.727 --> 30:18.381
while this place
has been left to rot,

30:19.208 --> 30:20.253
it's an insult to us all.

30:22.385 --> 30:23.865
What if we did something?

30:23.909 --> 30:25.867
Seriously,
what if we did something?

30:25.911 --> 30:28.696
It's like Dad always said,
"You can talk, talk, talk.

30:28.739 --> 30:32.221
Sooner or later, a man's
gotta stand up and be a man!

30:33.135 --> 30:34.267
And he's gotta fight."

30:36.051 --> 30:38.749
That's all well and good,
but what can we do?

30:39.489 --> 30:40.664
I don't know.

30:45.104 --> 30:46.409
What if we burn it down?

31:00.859 --> 31:02.034
Shh...

31:02.077 --> 31:04.906
Come on. Come on. Okay.

31:04.950 --> 31:07.822
All right, gentlemen,
let's light 'em up.

31:11.478 --> 31:13.045
I already got one.

31:13.088 --> 31:16.439
No sloppy work. Safety first.
I'll show you how it's done.

31:20.487 --> 31:21.923
Look at it burn!

31:28.277 --> 31:29.496
Stronger than steel now?

31:35.284 --> 31:36.503
I can't breathe.

31:38.461 --> 31:40.028
Oh, no, he's human.

31:41.551 --> 31:43.162
-Earl! Earl!
-I'll go get help.

31:46.513 --> 31:48.776
He's got a face changer.

31:48.819 --> 31:51.431
Don't move. Don't move.
I remember you.

31:51.474 --> 31:52.954
He's dangerous.

31:52.998 --> 31:56.653
No, I'm not.
I'm a floor manager.

31:58.003 --> 31:59.482
No, you're not.

31:59.526 --> 32:01.832
-You're an alien.
-Don't.

32:05.619 --> 32:07.664
I actually met him once,

32:07.708 --> 32:09.492
and I thought,
"This guy is soft."

32:09.536 --> 32:10.972
But I don't know.
Maybe I'm wrong.

32:11.016 --> 32:13.540
Maybe this is exactly
what we need.

32:13.583 --> 32:16.021
We need humans
protecting humans.

32:16.064 --> 32:17.544
I mean, when
the Founding Fathers said,

32:17.587 --> 32:18.980
"All men are created equal,"

32:19.024 --> 32:20.982
what did they mean?
They meant men.

32:21.026 --> 32:22.941
They didn't mean some roach
from the vacuum of space.

32:22.984 --> 32:25.508
I mean, my God,
if Benjamin Franklin
were alive today,

32:25.552 --> 32:28.207
would he have protected
the right of some Maaldorian

32:28.250 --> 32:30.426
to take your job, Thack?

32:30.470 --> 32:33.516
-Hell no.
-Hell no, no, no.

32:33.560 --> 32:34.822
He would have defended you.

32:34.865 --> 32:36.780
Can you give me a second?
Just pass those out.

32:36.824 --> 32:38.739
I'll be right back, everyone.

32:40.262 --> 32:41.394
Dean Warren.

32:44.745 --> 32:47.574
Ben. How are you?

32:47.617 --> 32:51.708
I'm good. I'm very good.
How are you?

32:51.752 --> 32:53.710
Wish I could say the same.

32:53.754 --> 32:55.930
Classes are overcrowded,
budget's being cut.

32:56.931 --> 32:58.541
Minnie and I lost
the house, too.

32:58.585 --> 33:01.718
-Oh, no, no.
-That genesis event.

33:01.762 --> 33:03.982
-Terraforming.
-Right.

33:05.461 --> 33:06.680
We're in student housing now.

33:06.723 --> 33:10.075
-Oh, I'm sure
Minnie loves that.
-Yeah.

33:10.684 --> 33:13.339
Look, Ben,

33:14.862 --> 33:17.125
I'm sorry for what happened

33:17.169 --> 33:18.909
-with you and the University.
-Oh! No--

33:18.953 --> 33:21.956
No, it was wrong throwing you
out on the street like that.

33:22.000 --> 33:23.653
I don't think
any of us understood

33:23.697 --> 33:25.655
what you were going through,
but now...

33:25.699 --> 33:29.224
Now, a lot of people are going
through the same thing.

33:29.268 --> 33:31.792
Well, what's happening
is happening to us,

33:31.835 --> 33:33.054
and that gives us power,

33:33.098 --> 33:34.621
that means
that we can fight back.

33:34.664 --> 33:35.796
As a matter of fact,
me and some friends,

33:35.839 --> 33:37.928
we are putting together

33:37.972 --> 33:40.670
something
like a support group,

33:40.714 --> 33:43.717
and I would like very much
for you to join us.

34:01.648 --> 34:03.867
Professor Lockwood.

34:05.652 --> 34:08.133
Well, that depends
on who's asking.

34:08.176 --> 34:10.961
Someone who knows
that you and your friends

34:11.005 --> 34:12.963
have been harassing
alien immigrants

34:13.007 --> 34:14.835
for the last couple of months.

34:14.878 --> 34:17.055
Hurting them, killing them.

34:17.664 --> 34:18.882
Get in.

34:25.193 --> 34:28.109
So, you're the thing
that goes bump in the night.

34:28.153 --> 34:29.458
Okay, listen,
I don't really know

34:29.502 --> 34:30.503
what you're talking about.

34:30.546 --> 34:31.852
You boys are good.

34:34.724 --> 34:35.986
But you're sloppy.

34:36.030 --> 34:37.640
We found a partial fingerprint

34:37.684 --> 34:40.556
in the pipe you used to beat
over the head of that Bravik.

34:40.600 --> 34:42.384
And we found
your DNA in the dirt

34:42.428 --> 34:45.474
next to the bodies
of those Maaldorian twins.

34:45.518 --> 34:48.912
They got you good, huh?
But you got them better.

34:50.610 --> 34:52.394
This should help
for next time.

34:56.137 --> 34:58.574
Why would I need body armor
if you're gonna arrest me?

34:58.618 --> 35:02.491
I'm not gonna arrest you.
You've done such great work.

35:02.535 --> 35:06.713
I'm here to tell you
that we need to work together.

35:06.756 --> 35:08.018
People love you, Ben.

35:08.062 --> 35:10.760
You have
a rare gift of communication,

35:10.804 --> 35:15.200
like Franklin Roosevelt
or Mussolini.

35:15.243 --> 35:18.028
The people I work with,
they don't have such gifts.

35:18.072 --> 35:20.683
But I think
if we could all work together,

35:20.727 --> 35:24.731
we could make this country
a much better place.

35:25.775 --> 35:26.776
How?

35:26.820 --> 35:28.735
We're gonna
expose the president

35:28.778 --> 35:32.695
as a liar, a fraud,
and an alien.

35:35.481 --> 35:37.091
Read a little 4chan, do ya?

35:37.135 --> 35:40.573
I can understand
why you wouldn't believe me.

35:40.616 --> 35:43.663
But can you imagine
if we proved it was true?

35:43.706 --> 35:45.621
How that would
change the world?

35:47.188 --> 35:49.147
Well, that's a nice dream,

35:49.190 --> 35:52.846
but I don't even
know who you are.

35:52.889 --> 35:54.935
Mercy Graves.

35:54.978 --> 35:57.285
And that's my brother, Otis.

35:57.720 --> 35:59.331
What's up?

35:59.374 --> 36:02.856
And most importantly,
this is Fiona.

36:02.899 --> 36:04.771
Part-time bartender,

36:04.814 --> 36:06.947
full-time
alien rights activist.

36:06.990 --> 36:09.210
Don't be fooled
by the lipstick.

36:09.254 --> 36:12.257
Beneath the disguise,
she's a monster.

36:12.300 --> 36:14.781
One who
is organizing other monsters

36:14.824 --> 36:16.826
to defend
themselves against us.

36:16.870 --> 36:18.959
But that's okay.

36:19.002 --> 36:20.787
Because some
of these creatures

36:20.830 --> 36:22.789
have skills we can use.

36:22.832 --> 36:24.399
So, what do you say?

36:25.313 --> 36:26.749
Besties?

37:12.926 --> 37:14.232
Get down!

37:19.976 --> 37:23.719
Earth first!
Earth first! Earth first!

37:38.386 --> 37:40.083
The yellow
sun radiation is helping

37:40.127 --> 37:42.129
the shield
counteract the Kryptonite.

37:42.999 --> 37:44.871
But not fast enough.

37:44.914 --> 37:45.915
So, what are you saying?

37:45.959 --> 37:47.787
Unless we could
somehow get her

37:47.830 --> 37:50.355
out of Earth's
very atmosphere,

37:50.398 --> 37:52.226
soon, there won't be anything
we can do for her.

37:52.270 --> 37:56.883
Then, that's what we do.
I mean, it worked for Mon-El.

37:56.926 --> 37:58.972
Then we can
just put her in a pod,

37:59.015 --> 38:00.539
and we can
send her to Argo City.

38:00.582 --> 38:02.889
Negative. Supergirl's
already been irradiated.

38:02.932 --> 38:04.325
She's too weak.

38:04.369 --> 38:08.547
Alex, if we try to take her
off-world, she'll die.

38:08.590 --> 38:10.897
Well, there must
be something I can do.

38:10.940 --> 38:12.420
There is, objectively,

38:12.464 --> 38:15.945
across the entire
quantifiable universe,

38:15.989 --> 38:17.599
nothing you could do.

38:21.951 --> 38:24.824
Then I need to ask
somebody else for help.

38:28.958 --> 38:30.612
Lena--

38:30.656 --> 38:31.874
She's this way.

38:31.918 --> 38:33.398
Hey, listen,
I know that you and Supergirl,

38:33.441 --> 38:36.749
you don't always see
eye to eye on everything,

38:36.792 --> 38:40.753
but it means a tremendous
amount to us, to me,

38:40.796 --> 38:42.798
that you're always here
when we need you the most.

38:42.842 --> 38:44.931
People underestimate me,
but I care.

38:44.974 --> 38:46.498
I really do.

38:49.718 --> 38:51.241
You're here.

38:52.852 --> 38:56.638
Oh, my. A radiation-controlled
proto-environment

38:56.682 --> 38:59.162
housed in a vacuum-sealed,
mechanical exoskeleton

38:59.206 --> 39:02.165
contained in a spring-loaded
two-millimeter disc.

39:02.209 --> 39:03.645
Supergirl is gonna have to
stay inside this

39:03.689 --> 39:05.560
until we figure out how
to detoxify the atmosphere.

39:05.604 --> 39:07.997
Which we have
no idea how to do.

39:08.041 --> 39:10.304
So, this is indefinite
confinement?

39:12.393 --> 39:16.049
We have no other choice,
so, do it.

39:43.250 --> 39:45.731
Don't worry. He's with us.

39:50.605 --> 39:51.911
Is Supergirl dead?

39:51.954 --> 39:55.044
It's nothing official yet,
but it looks scary.

39:55.088 --> 39:57.569
Just one more thing.

39:57.612 --> 40:00.093
Hey, hey! Stop!
What are you doing?

40:00.136 --> 40:02.095
-Tying up loose ends.
-It happens.

40:02.138 --> 40:04.924
No! No, not here.
We do not kill our own.

40:04.967 --> 40:08.884
Oh, please. He's a nobody.

40:08.928 --> 40:10.277
Are you sure?

40:12.105 --> 40:14.237
All right.
You're from the DEO, right?

40:14.281 --> 40:15.935
You got these fine people out.

40:15.978 --> 40:17.066
-Yeah.
-Good.

40:17.110 --> 40:18.241
Well, then I'm gonna assume

40:18.285 --> 40:20.330
that you can
get us all back in.
