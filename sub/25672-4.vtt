<font size="20"><b>Hey, don't you think we're a bit far out?</b></font>

00:05.600 --> 00:08.900
<font size="20"><b>No point in searching 
if we're not spread out.</b></font>

00:08.900 --> 00:11.690
<font size="20"><b>Why did I get stuck with you?</b></font>

00:11.690 --> 00:16.030
<font size="20"><b>Wait, Marlo... You just wanted
alone time with me, didn't you?</b></font>

00:16.030 --> 00:20.370
<font size="20"><b>Hitch... I'm sorry, but you're
not my first choice either.</b></font>

00:20.370 --> 00:23.620
<font size="20"><b>Oh, is that right? Well, good for you.</b></font>

00:23.620 --> 00:26.290
<font size="20"><b>But, don't you think it's odd?</b></font>

00:26.290 --> 00:30.340
<font size="20"><b>Why would the Scouts kill
a civilian and run for the hills?</b></font>

00:30.340 --> 00:36.180
<font size="20"><b>They're the same group that's always
risking their lives for the sake of humanity.</b></font>

<font size="20"><b>I can't believe you... Did you forget?</b></font>

00:39.640 --> 00:42.470
<font size="20"><b>Remember what they did to Stohess District?</b></font>

00:42.470 --> 00:45.350
<font size="20"><b>How they turned it into a battlefield?</b></font>

00:45.350 --> 00:48.610
<font size="20"><b>All those corpses we had to carry?</b></font>

00:49.610 --> 00:52.230
<font size="20"><b>And how Annie's still missing?</b></font>

00:53.610 --> 00:58.120
<font size="20"><b>All of her junk is still in
my room... and it's annoying.</b></font>

00:58.120 --> 01:04.160
<font size="20"><b>But they also uncovered that Titan in hiding
and somehow managed to capture it.</b></font>

01:04.160 --> 01:07.750
<font size="20"><b>You think any other regiment could do that?</b></font>

01:07.750 --> 01:11.460
<font size="20"><b>If the Scouts get disbanded
like this, humanity can't...</b></font>

01:11.460 --> 01:12.630

01:13.800 --> 01:15.470

<font size="20"><b>Don't move!</b></font>

01:23.430 --> 01:25.390
<font size="20"><b>Slowly turn this way.</b></font>

01:28.650 --> 01:30.690
<font size="20"><b>You must be a scout.</b></font>

01:32.650 --> 01:35.650
<font size="20"><b>Just like that... Not a word.</b></font>

01:35.650 --> 01:38.360
<font size="20"><b>Now listen to me and do as I--</b></font>

01:40.410 --> 01:44.790
<font size="20"><b>That's right... Hand over your
guns to the one in front.</b></font>

01:51.040 --> 01:53.000

the interrogation over with.</b></font>

03:51.000 --> 03:56.710
<font size="20"><b>So, it's unmistakable that the Scout
Regiment murdered a civilian?</b></font>

03:56.710 --> 03:59.000

03:59.000 --> 04:03.340

04:35.250 --> 04:38.840
<font size="20"><b>It's a weapon practically made
for killing the Scouts...</b></font>

04:38.840 --> 04:42.920

05:54.620 --> 05:59.630
