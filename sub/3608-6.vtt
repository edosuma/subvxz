00:02.001 --> 00:03.670
Previously on Lost:

00:03.754 --> 00:06.089
Boone, what do you see?

00:30.447 --> 00:32.615
All right, all of you, get up.

00:32.700 --> 00:34.951
We're moving out.

00:37.788 --> 00:40.957
- Moving out where?
- Back to where you came from.

00:45.587 --> 00:49.006
- Your buddy ran off into the jungle.
- Michael... he just left.

00:52.428 --> 00:53.928
Walt!

00:54.054 --> 00:57.390
What are we supposed to do?
Wait for him?

00:57.474 --> 01:01.561
- What are you doing?
- I'm going to help him find his friend.

01:30.841 --> 01:33.092
You thirsty, dog?

01:33.177 --> 01:35.511
Yeah, you're always thirsty, aren't you?

01:37.347 --> 01:39.348
So, drink.

01:44.521 --> 01:47.064
Come on.

01:47.149 --> 01:49.692
Gather your things.

01:49.777 --> 01:52.028
Where are we going?

01:52.154 --> 01:53.863
Sayid?

01:56.074 --> 01:59.535
- Right over here.
- Where are we going?

02:12.674 --> 02:14.884
What do you think?

02:16.136 --> 02:17.970
Does it have an inside?

02:36.657 --> 02:39.992
- When did you do this?
- It's all yours.

02:42.246 --> 02:43.871
Thank you.

02:45.624 --> 02:48.084
You are quite welcome.

03:16.905 --> 03:18.906
I'm sorry.

03:29.626 --> 03:32.545
You need to carry that all the time?

03:32.629 --> 03:35.965
I only carry it
because I have someone to protect.

03:57.654 --> 04:00.239
Ana, it's gotta be over an hour.

04:00.324 --> 04:05.077
- Shouldn't we start moving again?
- Let them rest a little while longer.

04:05.162 --> 04:07.204
Yeah, but what if they come?

04:09.333 --> 04:13.586
- She's lost.
- I am not lost.

04:13.670 --> 04:17.589
Then tell me, Ponce de LeÃ³n,
which way are we supposed to go?

04:21.845 --> 04:25.556
All right then, genius,
which way would you go?

04:25.641 --> 04:28.184
Hey, I'm with you.

04:28.268 --> 04:32.146
Sit tight and wait for Mr. Eko
to show up and guide us.

04:33.649 --> 04:38.069
If your friend didn't run off, Eko
would still be here now, wouldn't he?

04:38.195 --> 04:41.739
You sure didn't have any problem
leaving him behind, though, huh?

04:43.325 --> 04:46.285
Mike only cares about himself
and his kid.

04:46.370 --> 04:48.788
Neither's got squat to do with me.

04:48.872 --> 04:51.207
Glad you feel that way.

04:52.209 --> 04:54.627
Didn't expect to see you again.

05:05.722 --> 05:08.015
Yeah, yeah, Chewie, I know.

05:08.100 --> 05:11.060
My arm's about to fall off.

05:13.939 --> 05:16.482
- You OK?
- Yes.

05:16.566 --> 05:19.068
But we have to go.

05:19.152 --> 05:22.780
- I saw them.
- What? How many were there?

05:22.864 --> 05:25.241
- Did you see the kids?
- Libby.

05:27.244 --> 05:29.912
We need to go. Now.

05:29.997 --> 05:32.957
All right, we're moving out.

05:34.418 --> 05:35.710
Now.

05:56.148 --> 05:58.357
So, does all this...

05:58.442 --> 06:01.527
...the tent, the flowers...

06:03.071 --> 06:05.448
...mean that we're serious now?

06:05.532 --> 06:07.950
Quite definitely not.

06:08.035 --> 06:11.287
I do this for all the girls I meet
on deserted islands.

06:15.792 --> 06:17.960
Don't go anywhere.

06:19.129 --> 06:22.381
- Where are you going?
- To get some water.

06:27.512 --> 06:29.597
Let me.

06:38.273 --> 06:39.940
I'll be right back.

06:53.747 --> 06:56.082
That was quick.

07:19.272 --> 07:23.901
There's nothing. There's no one there.

07:23.985 --> 07:28.114
- I'm telling you. I saw Walt.
- It was a dream, Shannon...

07:28.198 --> 07:31.826
He was here. I saw him.
He went into the tent.

07:31.910 --> 07:33.702
I was only gone a few moments.

07:33.787 --> 07:38.916
- You must have fallen asleep...
- This was not a dream. I saw Walt!

07:39.000 --> 07:41.460
Then where is he?

07:42.587 --> 07:44.421
Hey. What's going on?

07:44.548 --> 07:46.340
Nothing. It's just a dream.

07:46.424 --> 07:48.384
Everything's fine.

07:55.225 --> 07:57.268
Shannon...

07:57.352 --> 08:00.396
- What's wrong?
- Shannon had a nightmare.

08:02.566 --> 08:04.650
And why is he up?

08:04.734 --> 08:06.819
- I woke him.
- You woke him?

08:06.903 --> 08:11.240
I heard screams, I got worried.
Would you rather I had left him alone?

08:11.324 --> 08:14.076
You woke up the baby
and ran towards them?

08:14.161 --> 08:17.788
- It sounded like she needed help...
- He's gonna need feeding.

08:17.873 --> 08:20.833
He's going to be up all night
and fussy all day.

08:20.917 --> 08:22.793
- Sorry.
- All right. No harm done.

08:22.878 --> 08:25.588
Give him here, then. I got him...

08:32.761 --> 08:35.054
Hey, it's OK.

08:35.140 --> 08:36.182
It's OK.

08:38.934 --> 08:41.895
Wait.

08:43.773 --> 08:47.526
- Come back and let's talk about this.
- Do you believe me?

08:51.364 --> 08:55.117
No. I know what I saw.

09:14.596 --> 09:19.099
Beautiful, Sophie. OK, can you bring
your shoulders down for me a little?

09:19.184 --> 09:21.644
Extend up. Good.

09:21.770 --> 09:25.189
And, finish. Very nice, ladies.

09:25.273 --> 09:28.275
Did my papa see me?

09:31.112 --> 09:32.571
I think so.

09:34.658 --> 09:36.242
Wonderful.

09:37.410 --> 09:40.663
All right, thank you
for a great class today, ladies.

09:41.581 --> 09:43.666
Very nice work, Tina.

09:49.714 --> 09:53.008
He wants me to be his au pair.
Can you believe that?

09:53.134 --> 09:54.260
Au pair, my ass.

09:54.344 --> 09:57.930
"Live in my big house,
take care of my kids."

09:58.014 --> 10:02.142
Next thing, it's "Oh, I am sorry.
I did not know you were in the shower."

10:02.227 --> 10:04.270
Please. What a perv.

10:06.064 --> 10:08.023
- Hello?
- Shannon,

10:08.108 --> 10:10.276
your father's been in an accident.

10:10.402 --> 10:13.195
I'm on my way to St. Sebastian's.
I'll meet you there.

10:14.531 --> 10:16.407
- Mrs. Rutherford?
- Yes.

10:16.491 --> 10:19.493
Why don't we talk down here?

10:21.997 --> 10:25.207
Doctor, my husband, Adam. How is he?

10:25.292 --> 10:28.210
Your husband
was in a head-on collision with an SUV.

10:28.295 --> 10:31.380
He suffered massive internal injuries.

10:33.258 --> 10:36.051
He stopped breathing
at the site of the accident.

10:37.929 --> 10:40.556
I'm afraid
we were unable to resuscitate him.

10:41.516 --> 10:43.642
I'm so sorry.

10:46.396 --> 10:49.481
- May I see him?
- Of course.

10:52.819 --> 10:55.696
- Would your daughter like to come?
- Stepdaughter.

10:57.907 --> 11:00.075
Come on, Shannon.

11:10.587 --> 11:13.339
How much further to their camp?

11:13.423 --> 11:17.092
A day. Maybe more. Maybe less.

11:17.218 --> 11:20.220
Thanks for being so specific.

11:26.144 --> 11:28.437
Damn it!

11:28.772 --> 11:31.065
I'm OK. I'm fine.

11:32.025 --> 11:35.527
You wanna let me
just take a look at your shoulder?

11:35.612 --> 11:38.781
- What are you, a doctor?
- Clinical psychologist.

11:38.907 --> 11:41.367
You're a shrink.

11:41.451 --> 11:43.619
Maybe you ought to talk to my shoulder.

11:44.954 --> 11:47.915
- How'd you get shot anyway?
- With a gun.

11:50.543 --> 11:53.462
He got shot when they took my kid.

11:59.094 --> 12:02.054
- It's bad, right?
- Yeah, it's bad.

12:03.306 --> 12:05.682
But it's not real bad.

12:05.767 --> 12:08.727
Come on, you're gonna be OK.

12:08.812 --> 12:10.938
Let's go.

12:16.653 --> 12:18.862
I'm all right. I'm fine.

12:21.491 --> 12:23.659
Let me give you a hand, OK?

12:29.290 --> 12:33.085
Tell me again why we're doing this
here when there's a dryer in the hatch?

12:33.169 --> 12:35.504
I don't like the hatch.

12:36.172 --> 12:38.757
It's because of the doomsday button,
isn't it?

12:38.842 --> 12:42.928
Well, who needs a dryer
when we've got sun and fresh air?

12:43.012 --> 12:46.098
Wouldn't wanna spoil ourselves,
now, would we?

12:46.182 --> 12:48.225
Yeah, "spoil."

12:48.351 --> 12:50.644
Do you know where Michael and Walt

12:50.728 --> 12:53.897
left the stuff that they didn't
take with them on the raft?

12:53.982 --> 12:57.109
- What kind of stuff?
- Their clothes?

12:57.193 --> 13:00.779
I think their stuff's still on the
beach, back where their tent is.

13:01.448 --> 13:02.906
Thanks.

13:05.493 --> 13:07.744
Poor thing.

13:07.871 --> 13:11.748
Can't be easy, losing the one person
you love on the island.

13:28.892 --> 13:33.645
Here, smell this. That's his, right?
Come on, get a good whiff.

13:33.730 --> 13:37.900
You're always trying to run off
and find him, then find him. Find Walt.

13:42.363 --> 13:44.907
Good dog. Find Walt!

14:10.350 --> 14:13.227
I know I woke you
and I'm so very, very sorry,

14:13.311 --> 14:16.438
but, please,
staying awake for eight hours straight?

14:16.523 --> 14:18.941
Isn't that
cruel and unusual punishment?

14:19.025 --> 14:20.817
How's that cradle treating you?

14:20.902 --> 14:23.904
The cradle's great,
it's the baby that's the problem.

14:25.949 --> 14:28.867
- What's wrong?
- He just won't sleep.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.834
May I?

14:37.919 --> 14:39.628
Sure.

14:43.299 --> 14:46.969
Babies like the feeling
of being constricted.

14:47.053 --> 14:51.181
It's not until we're older
that we develop the desire to be free.

14:53.810 --> 14:55.394
There.

15:06.781 --> 15:10.117
You know, I think everybody
knows more about my baby than me.

15:11.202 --> 15:13.745
Everybody?

15:13.830 --> 15:17.583
Charlie read me the riot act last night
for waking him.

15:17.667 --> 15:21.253
And as mad as it made me,
turns out he was right.

15:23.339 --> 15:26.383
It's like we're playing
Mum and Dad to this baby,

15:26.509 --> 15:28.969
yet I don't remember marrying him.

15:30.597 --> 15:35.767
Seriously. We're practically strangers.
Charlie could be some religious freak.

15:35.852 --> 15:37.769
I seriously doubt that.

15:37.854 --> 15:41.773
Then why does he carry around
a Virgin Mary statue?

15:41.858 --> 15:45.444
- A what?
- You know, one of the little statues?

15:45.528 --> 15:48.113
He says he found it in the jungle.

15:51.909 --> 15:54.119
How about that?

16:05.381 --> 16:07.132
I'm so sorry.

16:07.216 --> 16:09.676
Thank you, Jerry.
I'm so glad you could come.

16:10.720 --> 16:13.555
- If you need anything, please call me.
- Thank you.

16:29.656 --> 16:31.907
Death sucks, doesn't it?

16:31.991 --> 16:34.576
Boone!

16:34.702 --> 16:36.912
- Hey.
- Hey.

16:40.083 --> 16:42.876
I'm so sorry, Shan.

16:45.254 --> 16:47.881
You came back.

16:58.476 --> 17:02.229
- Where'd the poster of Marky Mark go?
- I'm 18, Boone.

17:08.903 --> 17:11.238
- Your mom's gonna freak.
- It's a wake.

17:13.366 --> 17:16.410
I mean, seriously,
who doesn't serve booze at a wake?

17:18.788 --> 17:20.955
Scotch?

17:22.416 --> 17:25.127
To your dad.

17:37.765 --> 17:40.767
Maybe after all this
you'll come visit me in New York.

17:43.938 --> 17:49.151
I won't have to visit if I get that job
at the Martha Graham Dance Company.

17:49.235 --> 17:51.862
I'll be living there.

17:51.988 --> 17:54.406
Right. Internship.

17:56.367 --> 18:00.954
I know it's, like, a one in three
thousand chance, but I might get it.

18:02.206 --> 18:03.999
Absolutely.

18:09.505 --> 18:11.673
Have you spoken to my mother?

18:13.468 --> 18:16.678
She's going through her thing
and I'm going through mine.

18:18.097 --> 18:20.932
Have you two been getting along?

18:22.643 --> 18:25.020
She hates me.

18:25.980 --> 18:28.273
Just try to talk to her.

18:30.860 --> 18:33.862
From day one,
she resented my relationship with him.

18:35.698 --> 18:37.532
With Dad.

19:11.484 --> 19:14.236
- We need a break.
- Five minutes.

19:14.320 --> 19:16.321
Here.

19:29.544 --> 19:31.628
What are you looking at?

19:31.754 --> 19:34.172
We have to cut inland.

19:34.257 --> 19:36.716
What? Into the jungle?

19:39.345 --> 19:41.638
They said their people
were on the beach.

19:41.722 --> 19:44.850
- If we keep walking...
- The beach curves into a peninsula.

19:47.353 --> 19:49.896
It may not be passable.

19:49.981 --> 19:51.731
May not?

19:53.484 --> 19:55.151
May not.

19:56.195 --> 19:59.322
You're doing this to get
the cowboy back faster, aren't you?

20:00.783 --> 20:03.535
You would risk our lives to help him?

20:04.620 --> 20:06.955
It's the only way I know.

20:09.625 --> 20:12.294
I liked you better
when you weren't talking.

20:18.467 --> 20:21.386
I can't believe he's still asleep.

20:23.306 --> 20:26.099
Swaddling works every time.

20:28.644 --> 20:30.312
Do you want to hold him?

20:34.609 --> 20:36.735
That's OK.

20:36.819 --> 20:39.154
Put your arms out.

20:43.326 --> 20:45.660
It's OK. There.

20:55.338 --> 20:57.213
- He smells good.
- Doesn't he?

20:57.298 --> 20:58.673
Yeah.

21:00.509 --> 21:02.010
Oh.

21:04.221 --> 21:07.182
- Hello, Charlie.
- Hello.

21:07.266 --> 21:10.435
Hey, John just taught me a new trick.
Swaddling.

21:12.021 --> 21:13.563
That's excellent.

21:15.900 --> 21:18.568
I just came to take him
so you could have your walk.

21:24.283 --> 21:27.577
Well, great timing.
Yeah, I got to get going.

21:29.372 --> 21:30.872
I got him.

21:35.711 --> 21:38.213
Well, thanks for your help, John.

21:38.297 --> 21:40.006
You're welcome.

21:45.221 --> 21:46.471
What?

22:20.840 --> 22:24.050
I'm fine. I'm fine, damn it.

22:26.595 --> 22:28.430
Shut up!

22:28.556 --> 22:32.684
- What? They can't talk at all?
- If he talks he'll get us all killed.

22:32.768 --> 22:36.771
By what? Them? I thought
they lived a day back that way.

22:36.856 --> 22:40.775
How about you shut your mouth
and get your buddy over here moving?

22:43.154 --> 22:45.321
What happened to you people?

22:50.536 --> 22:53.121
You want us to
take you back with us, fine.

22:53.205 --> 22:55.331
But you want me to keep quiet?

22:57.376 --> 23:00.211
Then you need to tell me why I have to.

23:10.973 --> 23:15.477
They came
the first night that we got here.

23:18.564 --> 23:21.066
They took three of us.

23:21.150 --> 23:23.902
Nothing happened for two weeks.

23:23.986 --> 23:27.155
Then they came back, and took nine more.

23:30.826 --> 23:33.203
They're smart.

23:33.329 --> 23:37.165
And they're animals.
And they could be anywhere, at any time.

23:40.503 --> 23:44.047
Now we're moving through
the jungle... their jungle...

23:44.799 --> 23:48.259
...just so that you can save
your little hick friend over here.

23:49.678 --> 23:54.015
And if you think that one gun
and one bullet is gonna stop them...

23:55.476 --> 23:57.852
...think again.

24:01.524 --> 24:04.776
So shut your mouth, and keep moving.

24:04.860 --> 24:07.362
They took my son.

24:10.199 --> 24:12.826
They took a lot of things.

24:42.690 --> 24:46.359
I know what it is to lose someone
you care deeply about.

24:54.535 --> 24:57.620
You really think
that this is all about Boone?

25:02.960 --> 25:05.920
I saw Walt, Sayid.

25:08.257 --> 25:10.592
Then why are we sitting
at Boone's grave?

25:17.141 --> 25:20.602
- Just go back, Sayid.
- Where are you going?

25:22.396 --> 25:24.105
To find him.

25:29.028 --> 25:31.196
It came.

25:31.280 --> 25:34.365
What? Oh, my God.

25:35.451 --> 25:37.368
Open it.

25:40.831 --> 25:43.750
- I can't open it.
- You what?

25:43.834 --> 25:44.876
You open it.

25:44.960 --> 25:48.588
You've been waiting six months
for this letter. No way I'm opening it.

26:02.353 --> 26:04.229
- I got it.
- You got it?

26:04.313 --> 26:08.149
- I got it!
- Oh, my God, you're going to New York!

26:08.275 --> 26:11.319
You're going to New York! Oh, my God!

26:11.445 --> 26:14.864
Hello. Yeah, this is her.

26:18.535 --> 26:20.495
That's impossible.

26:20.579 --> 26:22.789
OK, are you sure?

26:24.541 --> 26:27.460
Of course. I will certainly do that.

26:28.504 --> 26:30.088
Sorry.

26:32.841 --> 26:34.634
What?

26:34.718 --> 26:36.636
My rent check bounced.

26:37.930 --> 26:40.682
But you're like... rich.

26:44.853 --> 26:48.773
I would have offered you a drink,
but I have a meeting in ten minutes.

26:48.857 --> 26:53.778
Yeah. My checks are bouncing.

26:53.862 --> 26:57.407
That happens when you withdraw
and you don't deposit.

26:57.491 --> 27:00.368
When do I get the money Dad left me?

27:03.706 --> 27:06.040
The money from the will?

27:06.166 --> 27:08.209
There was no will.

27:09.295 --> 27:10.962
What?

27:11.046 --> 27:14.924
Shannon,
your father and I had a living trust.

27:15.009 --> 27:16.968
Everything passed to me.

27:17.052 --> 27:20.555
I'm afraid there was nothing
specifically designated for you.

27:23.058 --> 27:24.475
Why would he do that?

27:24.560 --> 27:28.104
Well, maybe he just wanted you
to find your own way.

27:28.897 --> 27:30.648
We all have to work, Shannon.

27:30.733 --> 27:33.735
And most of us are the better for it.

27:33.819 --> 27:37.989
I can work. I just got
this really prestigious internship

27:38.073 --> 27:40.783
and I'm not gonna
make any money for a while

27:40.868 --> 27:43.745
but I'm gonna be working
like 16 hours a day.

27:43.829 --> 27:47.498
The only thing I've ever seen you do
16 hours a day straight is sleep.

27:49.043 --> 27:51.711
I just need to get to New York.

27:54.590 --> 27:58.259
I need just something to get started.

28:00.554 --> 28:04.140
- I'll pay you back.
- This week it's an internship.

28:04.224 --> 28:07.977
Last year it was, what...
interior design?

28:09.438 --> 28:11.981
You'll never pay me back.

28:12.816 --> 28:15.610
And you'll only hate yourself even more.

28:17.446 --> 28:20.448
I really want this, Sabrina.

28:20.532 --> 28:22.283
I can do this.

28:24.703 --> 28:26.954
I'm sorry, Shannon.

28:31.293 --> 28:32.960
You're on your own.

28:48.143 --> 28:50.311
Double sixes, how nice for you.

28:50.396 --> 28:52.480
Lucky.

28:59.488 --> 29:03.157
I hope you didn't get the wrong idea
about seeing me with the baby.

29:04.993 --> 29:07.120
What wrong idea would that be?

29:08.539 --> 29:13.126
You and Claire are close,
and you spend a lot of time with Aaron.

29:13.210 --> 29:15.545
I just wouldn't want
to overstep my bounds.

29:17.464 --> 29:20.383
Did she tell you we had a fight?

29:20.467 --> 29:23.428
She didn't say it was a fight.

29:27.099 --> 29:31.018
She was gonna give it up, you know...
for adoption.

29:32.563 --> 29:37.150
- She tell you that?
- Yeah. When I built the cradle.

29:38.819 --> 29:41.404
Oh, of course.

29:41.530 --> 29:43.406
When you built the cradle.

29:44.908 --> 29:46.909
Why do you ask?

29:47.035 --> 29:50.872
She's got a bit to learn...
about being a mum.

29:52.249 --> 29:54.917
Responsibility and all.

29:56.336 --> 30:01.257
Now, that's an interesting thing
to say, for a heroin addict.

30:03.886 --> 30:07.513
- Recovering addict.
- Recovering.

30:13.729 --> 30:15.897
It's your turn.

30:38.629 --> 30:41.172
Here, let me help you.

30:43.258 --> 30:44.842
I got it.

30:44.927 --> 30:48.221
I said I got him, man. Take a break.

30:48.347 --> 30:52.016
What?
You suddenly give a damn about me?

30:53.227 --> 30:57.063
Just leave me alone. Both of you.

30:58.524 --> 31:00.399
I got it.

31:02.236 --> 31:05.696
Hey! Hey! Hey, hey, hey!

31:07.533 --> 31:10.409
Come here. Come on.

31:12.037 --> 31:15.540
Hey, Sawyer. Hey, you OK?

31:18.126 --> 31:20.044
I would have left you behind.

31:20.128 --> 31:22.421
Shut up, man. Don't try to...

31:23.757 --> 31:26.300
I did leave you behind.

31:26.385 --> 31:29.887
Yeah, well, good thing I ain't you.

31:38.689 --> 31:43.568
Hey! Hey, hey! No, Sawyer. Sawyer!

31:44.820 --> 31:47.530
Sawyer! Hey!

31:50.033 --> 31:51.576
Water! Water!

31:51.660 --> 31:55.246
- Sawyer! Sawyer. Come on, man.
- Here you go.

31:55.330 --> 31:58.708
Here. Here. Thank you.

31:58.792 --> 32:00.543
Come on.

32:00.627 --> 32:02.753
Sawyer.

32:06.842 --> 32:09.385
- What's the matter with him?
- The fever.

32:09.469 --> 32:12.763
- He's got an infection, dehydrated.
- We gotta keep moving.

32:12.848 --> 32:15.182
- What?
- We gotta keep going.

32:17.060 --> 32:20.062
You wanna stay?
That's fine, but we're rolling out.

32:20.147 --> 32:21.897
We can't just leave him, Ana.

32:21.982 --> 32:25.026
Maybe if we rest a while,
he'll regain consciousness.

32:25.110 --> 32:28.029
Rest? Here?

32:28.113 --> 32:30.364
Do you remember what happened to us?

32:30.490 --> 32:33.409
What they did to us?

32:33.535 --> 32:35.536
Do you remember Goodwin?

32:39.791 --> 32:42.627
Ana's right,
maybe we should just push on.

32:42.711 --> 32:45.212
You know what?
I don't remember Goodwin,

32:45.297 --> 32:49.050
and I'm really sorry about whatever
happened to him, but I don't care.

32:49.885 --> 32:54.388
Mr. Eko, can you
help me make a stretcher?

33:02.564 --> 33:06.901
Hey, Bernard, I need four sticks...
sturdy ones, about five feet long.

33:06.985 --> 33:09.612
- Got it.
- You're gonna carry your friend.

33:09.738 --> 33:12.073
Yeah. We're gonna carry him.

33:17.913 --> 33:22.833
- Why are you doing this, Shannon?
- I didn't ask you to follow me.

33:22.918 --> 33:25.336
You'd rather be alone
and get lost or hurt.

33:25.420 --> 33:29.423
- I don't need your help, Sayid!
- Walt is not out here!

33:29.508 --> 33:33.177
You are following a Labrador
to find a boy who is on a raft...

33:33.261 --> 33:36.347
- He's not on the raft.
- What are you talking about?

33:38.934 --> 33:41.310
We found the bottle on the beach.

33:43.021 --> 33:46.232
The bottle with the messages
that they brought with them?

33:49.236 --> 33:53.239
I know he's out here somewhere.
I saw Walt.

33:55.450 --> 33:58.285
And the raft is gone
and he is all alone.

34:03.083 --> 34:04.709
Shannon...

35:09.649 --> 35:11.066
Come on!

35:21.495 --> 35:23.370
Cindy...

35:25.332 --> 35:27.208
Cindy!

35:27.334 --> 35:29.210
Where's Cindy?

35:30.128 --> 35:35.174
- What? She was just here...
- Cindy! Cindy!

35:35.258 --> 35:38.052
- Did they take her?
- How could she just be gone?

35:38.136 --> 35:39.887
Cindy!

35:40.013 --> 35:44.725
- I'm going after her.
- No. We stay together.

35:44.851 --> 35:47.353
We split up,
we give them what they want.

35:48.355 --> 35:52.608
This is all your fault! We never
should have gone through the jungle.

35:52.692 --> 35:54.902
You risked our lives to save him.

35:54.986 --> 35:58.280
He's already dead. This one's on you.

36:11.419 --> 36:13.504
What the hell is that?

36:20.053 --> 36:22.513
- Oh, God.
- Run!

36:32.774 --> 36:34.942
- Hey.
- Hey.

36:52.127 --> 36:54.587
She said no.

36:58.341 --> 37:01.760
I guess she knew
why I asked for the money.

37:04.180 --> 37:08.267
Can I crash at your place
in New York for just a little while?

37:10.312 --> 37:12.646
Until I get on my feet?

37:19.029 --> 37:21.071
I'm leaving New York.

37:21.740 --> 37:24.491
She offered me a job.

37:27.162 --> 37:31.498
- You're going to work for your mother?
- It's a really good job, Shannon.

37:38.131 --> 37:42.468
This is all I have, but my trust fund
will kick in at the end of the month.

37:42.552 --> 37:45.471
And after that
I can absolutely keep you afloat.

37:45.555 --> 37:51.352
Thank you, but I'm gonna figure out
a way to make my own money.

37:51.436 --> 37:54.104
But who knows when that's gonna be.
Just take it.

37:56.816 --> 38:00.945
- What, you don't think I can do it?
- I didn't say that.

38:01.029 --> 38:03.447
Do you believe I can
or don't you, Boone?

38:07.494 --> 38:12.206
OK, you know what? I really want you
to just take your money.

38:12.290 --> 38:14.959
- Go work for your mother. Take it!
- Shannon.

38:15.043 --> 38:18.462
- I'm trying to help you, Shannon!
- I don't want your money!

38:19.965 --> 38:21.757
OK.

38:33.603 --> 38:38.482
- Shannon! Are you OK?
- Do not help me up!

38:45.115 --> 38:47.157
Let's go back.

38:52.872 --> 38:55.582
Why don't you believe me?

38:58.878 --> 39:02.756
- I need you to believe in me!
- I do believe in you.

39:02.841 --> 39:06.427
You don't. No one does.

39:08.263 --> 39:10.431
They think that I am some kind of joke.

39:12.892 --> 39:17.604
- They think I'm worthless.
- Shannon, you are not worthless.

39:18.106 --> 39:20.232
You say that now...

39:21.609 --> 39:23.569
...but you don't...

39:26.531 --> 39:28.782
You're just gonna leave me.

39:31.870 --> 39:35.956
I know, as soon as we get out of here,
you're just gonna leave me.

39:43.298 --> 39:45.507
I will never leave you.

39:49.804 --> 39:51.764
I love you.

39:55.351 --> 39:57.311
And I believe you.

39:59.230 --> 40:00.981
You do?

40:03.276 --> 40:04.485
I do.

40:43.316 --> 40:45.484
Do you see him?

40:49.322 --> 40:55.035
Walt!

40:56.788 --> 40:58.455
- Walt!
- Shannon!

40:58.540 --> 41:00.916
Walt... wait!

41:05.213 --> 41:14.555
Shannon!
