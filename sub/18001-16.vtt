00:06.900 --> 00:08.266
George Lucas comes up to you,

00:08.319 --> 00:10.686
he hands you all six Star Wars movies.

00:10.738 --> 00:12.771
And he says you can pick any character,

00:12.773 --> 00:14.356
but you could only be in one movie.

00:14.408 --> 00:15.941
What movie would you be in, what character

00:15.943 --> 00:17.442
would you want to play?

00:17.494 --> 00:19.578
Oh, man, I mean,
if I were to pick...

00:19.613 --> 00:21.530
Please tell me you don't
realize you're Jar Jar Binks.

00:21.582 --> 00:23.115
How am I Jar Jar Binks?

00:23.117 --> 00:25.117
- Do I talk in a weird ac...
- Me nobody like.

00:27.621 --> 00:29.421
I don't know,
I-I'm not Jar Jar Binks.

00:29.456 --> 00:33.041
I think I want to be Han
Solo from Empire Strikes Back.

00:33.093 --> 00:34.493
Mike, who are you gonna be?

00:34.528 --> 00:36.928
Obi-Wan in Phantom Menace.

00:36.964 --> 00:37.929
George Lucas is
like, "You guys have looked

00:37.965 --> 00:39.297
in a mirror, right?"

00:39.350 --> 00:40.799
- Tell you what...
- Not lately.

00:40.851 --> 00:46.221
Why do you ask?

00:46.273 --> 00:48.140
I mean, I gotta
go Darth Vader, right?

00:48.192 --> 00:49.608
You come in,
they're screwing around.

00:49.643 --> 00:53.311
You're like... Just like, "Oh!"

00:53.313 --> 00:54.980
I'm gonna go Greedo.

00:55.032 --> 00:57.816
My face is covered, I
immediately get killed,

00:57.818 --> 00:59.451
yet I remain in the mythos forever

00:59.486 --> 01:01.236
with this "who shot first" thing.

01:01.288 --> 01:03.955
Oh, and you get to square
off with Ming too at the table.

01:03.991 --> 01:06.792
Yes, the... the
Handsome Solo over there.

01:09.963 --> 01:11.163
Hey, I shot first, man.

01:49.670 --> 01:51.536
Hello, and welcome to another episode

01:51.588 --> 01:54.873
of Comic Book Men, the only
show that has the infinity stones

01:54.925 --> 01:56.291
to tell it like it is.

01:56.343 --> 01:58.210
- I'm Kevin Smith.
- Bryan Johnson.

01:58.212 --> 01:59.511
- Walt Flanagan.
- Mike Zapcic.

01:59.546 --> 02:01.346
Ming Chen.

02:01.381 --> 02:02.547
All right, you guys get
in any shenanigans this week,

02:02.599 --> 02:04.015
or what?

02:04.051 --> 02:05.550
Jay happened to
be at the Stash today,

02:05.552 --> 02:08.386
and we all proceeded to just geek out.

02:15.796 --> 02:17.062
All right, good job, Ming.

02:17.064 --> 02:18.196
Remember, be... be
careful with that.

02:18.232 --> 02:19.981
That is old.

02:20.033 --> 02:22.534
That is the original glass
from Monmouth Street, dude.

02:22.569 --> 02:24.069
That's the original Jay
and Silent Bob Secret Stash.

02:24.121 --> 02:25.320
I got it.

02:25.372 --> 02:26.571
Does it bring back some memories?

02:26.573 --> 02:27.989
It does.

02:28.041 --> 02:29.708
I remember going
to the store and, like,

02:29.743 --> 02:31.710
it should have been open. I
would, like, yank on the door.

02:31.745 --> 02:33.211
That's the glass I'd have to look through

02:33.247 --> 02:34.913
to be like, "Where's Mewes?"

02:34.915 --> 02:36.414
That's true. That's true.

02:36.467 --> 02:38.250
- Hey, guys.
- What's going on?

02:38.302 --> 02:39.384
Hey, I think I have something

02:39.419 --> 02:40.502
that you're going to like.

02:40.554 --> 02:41.670
Oh, my God.

02:41.722 --> 02:44.005
1981, Milton Bradley.

02:44.057 --> 02:46.508
The world's first electronic
board game, Dark Tower.

02:46.560 --> 02:48.009
Oh, my God.

02:48.061 --> 02:49.261
I haven't seen one of these in a long time.

02:58.005 --> 02:59.771
I remember seeing this in the toy store.

02:59.823 --> 03:02.073
You know, you had, you know,
Chutes and Ladders, Life,

03:02.109 --> 03:04.109
Monopoly, and then you had this.

03:04.161 --> 03:05.744
I mean, those other games were for kids.

03:05.779 --> 03:07.746
- This was just like...
- This was mack daddy.

03:07.781 --> 03:08.914
This was a man's game right here?

03:08.949 --> 03:10.282
This is a man's game.

03:10.284 --> 03:12.200
It says 10 to adult right there.

03:12.252 --> 03:13.785
- Exactly.
- Can we open it up?

03:13.837 --> 03:14.786
- Yeah, for sure.
- Check it out?

03:14.838 --> 03:17.122
Okay.

03:17.174 --> 03:18.957
It's not very impressive looking.

03:18.959 --> 03:20.375
What are you talking about?

03:20.427 --> 03:22.294
It's a big, foreboding dark tower.

03:22.296 --> 03:24.212
You have... you have
your choice between this

03:24.264 --> 03:25.380
and, like, a little thimble.

03:25.432 --> 03:27.098
What are you gonna take?

03:27.134 --> 03:29.601
I remember that game.
And it was so complicated.

03:29.636 --> 03:32.437
There were beeps and whistles,
but it didn't make that game

03:32.472 --> 03:33.438
any more fun.

03:33.473 --> 03:34.973
I disagree.

03:35.025 --> 03:37.609
Right in the middle was
an intimidating electronic

03:37.644 --> 03:40.312
dark tower and it... it
had a keypad of buttons.

03:40.364 --> 03:42.948
And you could buy things and
you could battle orcs and trolls.

03:42.983 --> 03:44.232
In the early '80s, I thought

03:44.284 --> 03:46.818
that blew all the other games away.

03:46.820 --> 03:50.071
If only Candyland had
a tower in the middle of it.

03:50.123 --> 03:52.824
A dark tower.

03:52.876 --> 03:54.326
- There you go.
- There we go.

03:54.328 --> 03:55.327
You've played this, obviously.

03:55.329 --> 03:56.578
A couple times.

03:56.630 --> 03:58.330
You remember how exciting it was.

03:58.332 --> 04:01.082
The object of the game was
to go around, amass an army,

04:01.134 --> 04:03.335
find three keys, and then once
you did that, you could attack

04:03.387 --> 04:05.003
the evil inside the dark tower.

04:05.005 --> 04:06.304
It would light up when
you got into a battle.

04:06.340 --> 04:07.806
- It had orcs...
- You had this?

04:07.841 --> 04:09.341
Uh, I didn't have this as a kid.

04:09.343 --> 04:11.927
It was pretty... I
didn't. When it came out,

04:11.979 --> 04:13.428
it was a fairly expensive game.

04:13.480 --> 04:14.930
Suffice to say,
your parents would not

04:14.982 --> 04:16.430
- buy it for you?
- No.

04:16.483 --> 04:18.350
You were the original Oliver Twist.

04:18.351 --> 04:19.935
And even you got stuff as a kid, right?

04:19.987 --> 04:21.519
Yeah, sometimes.

04:21.521 --> 04:23.655
But it was usually after
my mom stole a credit card

04:23.690 --> 04:26.441
to pay for it.

04:26.493 --> 04:28.526
So it depended on if
it was a good mail, uh,

04:28.579 --> 04:31.446
mail theft day or not.

04:31.498 --> 04:32.948
Wow.

04:33.000 --> 04:36.368
I mean, she wasn't
as frugal as your pops.

04:36.370 --> 04:38.703
So later on in life
when I had some money,

04:38.705 --> 04:40.505
I went online and I bought this game.

04:40.540 --> 04:42.340
I paid over $100 for it.

04:42.376 --> 04:44.676
I had friends over. We
had Dark Tower parties.

04:44.711 --> 04:47.295
Oh, it sounds like a blast.

04:47.347 --> 04:48.713
But I ended up
selling it for, like, $300

04:48.715 --> 04:50.382
to buy my wife a expensive pair of shoes.

04:50.384 --> 04:51.883
Do you wish you had the game back

04:51.935 --> 04:53.518
- instead of the shoes now?
- No, but, you know,

04:53.553 --> 04:55.887
I'm... I would love to
have this back, though.

04:55.939 --> 04:58.807
All right, well,
there's a little catch here.

04:58.859 --> 05:03.528
When you turn it on, the score
comes up, but that only works

05:03.563 --> 05:06.731
if you kinda tap it in the
right place, the right time.

05:06.733 --> 05:08.233
So it won't turn on, you're saying?

05:08.235 --> 05:09.901
No, it will turn on sometimes.

05:09.903 --> 05:10.902
So it's broken
is what you're saying?

05:10.904 --> 05:12.237
You just have to have...

05:12.239 --> 05:13.989
You have to have good luck.

05:14.041 --> 05:15.407
All right, well, I
mean, with that in mind,

05:15.459 --> 05:16.992
I mean, what are you
looking to get for this?

05:17.044 --> 05:18.410
I think you guys can get

05:18.412 --> 05:20.745
over 200 for it in the Stash here, so...

05:20.797 --> 05:23.248
Give me 175 and you guys
can make a little money too.

05:23.300 --> 05:25.667
I mean, would you take 75?

05:25.719 --> 05:30.588
Um... the best I'd do is 125.

05:30.590 --> 05:32.173
With the tower's
not working, you know,

05:32.225 --> 05:35.093
I might as well pitch it in the garbage.

05:35.095 --> 05:36.094
That's a little... all right,
you know what, I'm sorry.

05:36.096 --> 05:37.679
That's a little harsh.

05:37.731 --> 05:39.347
That's a little harsh. I do like this game.

05:39.399 --> 05:40.849
Uh, it's fine, it's
fine. I appreciate it.

05:40.901 --> 05:42.517
I-I... yeah, I
can't go over 75, though.

05:42.569 --> 05:44.019
It's... it's fine.
I'll take it back.

05:44.071 --> 05:45.570
I'll sell it online.
Thank you so much, guys.

05:45.605 --> 05:47.439
- I appreciate it.
- Well, yeah,

05:47.441 --> 05:49.574
thanks for bringing it in.
I mean, it... it is cool.

05:49.609 --> 05:52.527
If it were working, I mean, I'd
be drooling all over this, but...

05:52.579 --> 05:53.945
Yeah.

05:53.947 --> 05:55.447
No drool today. But thank you.

05:55.499 --> 05:57.282
Yeah, thanks so much,
guys. I appreciate it.

05:57.334 --> 05:58.583
- Thank you.
- See you later.

06:00.287 --> 06:02.620
- What do you think?
- I've seen other copies

06:02.673 --> 06:04.956
not nearly in this good of condition.

06:05.008 --> 06:06.624
This is the holy grail for me.

06:12.915 --> 06:14.130
Hey, when you guys were kids,

06:14.146 --> 06:15.729
did you ever wish you had a talking dog?

06:15.765 --> 06:17.514
I saw a video. There
are dogs that can say,

06:17.566 --> 06:19.683
"I love you" and "mama"
now. I mean, it's not a lot.

06:19.735 --> 06:21.602
- Now?
- Yeah, yeah.

06:21.654 --> 06:23.237
It's been on
America's Funniest Home Videos

06:23.272 --> 06:24.187
for, like, 20 years now.

06:24.509 --> 06:28.443
I hear there's a special breed
of dog that can now say...

06:28.443 --> 06:31.931
"Mama!"

06:32.742 --> 06:34.526
If you have a
talking dog, do people know

06:34.578 --> 06:36.361
that the dog talks?
Well, because it...

06:36.413 --> 06:38.279
I wouldn't want people to
know, 'cause I could send

06:38.331 --> 06:41.282
my dog over to eavesdrop on conversations,

06:41.284 --> 06:42.917
then come over and tell me.

06:42.953 --> 06:44.619
Would you do the
same things you do in front

06:44.671 --> 06:47.922
of the dog now that you would do
in front of an intelligent dog?

06:47.958 --> 06:49.591
- No. No.
- No?

06:49.626 --> 06:51.092
The dog would run
right back to my girlfriend.

06:51.127 --> 06:53.795
"Bryan's cheating on you."

07:02.639 --> 07:04.606
- How you doing?
- Hey, how's it going, guys?

07:04.641 --> 07:06.808
Uh, can I took a look at
the Silver Surfer number 3?

07:06.810 --> 07:08.226
Absolutely. Mike,
want to grab that Surfer?

07:08.278 --> 07:10.311
- Sure.
- Big Surfer fan?

07:10.363 --> 07:12.397
Yeah, man. He's one of my favorites.

07:12.449 --> 07:13.982
- Here we are.
- There we go.

07:14.034 --> 07:16.734
Issue number 3. First
appearance of Mephisto.

07:16.786 --> 07:18.987
- What do you think?
- I've seen other copies

07:18.989 --> 07:21.289
not nearly in this good of condition.

07:28.164 --> 07:30.081
You a big fan of
the Silver Surfer, Jay?

07:30.133 --> 07:32.166
- I'm not. I'm not.
- Really?

07:32.218 --> 07:34.085
I mean, I like Silver
Surfer, but I'm just saying,

07:34.137 --> 07:35.837
I never read enough books

07:35.839 --> 07:38.006
to have enough knowledge of the Surfer.

07:38.058 --> 07:40.642
Well, he's the... he is
the thinking man's superhero,

07:40.677 --> 07:41.843
I'd have to say.

07:41.895 --> 07:44.012
He ponders every move.

07:44.014 --> 07:46.681
If he just wants to take a
step, there's like four or five

07:46.733 --> 07:49.851
thought balloons that precede that step.

07:49.903 --> 07:51.019
I think what
you're trying to say is,

07:51.071 --> 07:53.321
he's the boring superhero?

07:53.356 --> 07:55.023
So this is number 3 and it's...

07:55.025 --> 07:57.025
It's... it's the first
appearance of Mephisto,

07:57.027 --> 07:59.277
- one of his... his villains.
- Ooh.

07:59.329 --> 08:01.829
Mephisto is Marvel's answer to Satan,

08:01.865 --> 08:03.364
'cause they couldn't call him Satan.

08:03.416 --> 08:05.116
- Why couldn't they?
- Uh, comics code.

08:05.168 --> 08:08.786
They said you can't have
Satan being a character

08:08.838 --> 08:10.538
in a comic book.

08:10.540 --> 08:12.457
So just call him by
one of his many other names

08:12.509 --> 08:14.542
- and it's cool?
- Eh, pretty much.

08:16.596 --> 08:20.715
Marvel was never
afraid to tackle any fad,

08:20.767 --> 08:22.717
even the satanic fad.

08:22.719 --> 08:25.019
Yeah, they're just
like, "What are the kids into?

08:25.055 --> 08:28.356
The devil? All right.
Put a book out there."

08:28.391 --> 08:29.857
Let me ask you this.

08:29.893 --> 08:31.809
You're a pretty
straightforward dude and stuff.

08:31.861 --> 08:34.645
Why do you gravitate toward
the darkness, toward the devil?

08:34.698 --> 08:37.198
It's the ultimate evil.
I mean, I don't want to see...

08:37.232 --> 08:38.366
"And that's what I gravitate toward,

08:38.400 --> 08:40.068
the ultimate evil."

08:40.120 --> 08:41.068
No, I don't want to
see the ultimate evil win.

08:41.121 --> 08:42.703
Right.

08:42.739 --> 08:44.372
But if I want to
see my heroes throw down,

08:44.407 --> 08:46.240
I want to see them beat the ultimate evil.

08:46.292 --> 08:48.409
So you're growing up
going, "Ma, why won't Batman

08:48.461 --> 08:49.744
ever fight Satan?"

08:52.215 --> 08:53.998
What's the Silver Surfer's deal?

08:54.050 --> 08:55.717
Like, he's a superhero,
but what does he do?

08:55.752 --> 08:57.752
He has the Power Cosmic, man.

08:57.804 --> 09:00.922
He just soars through the spaceways.

09:00.924 --> 09:02.840
But how does he fight?
How does he fight someone?

09:02.892 --> 09:04.759
- With what powers?
- I mean...

09:04.761 --> 09:05.843
He's got plenty of
power. Just like he said,

09:05.895 --> 09:07.428
he's got the Power Cosmic.

09:07.430 --> 09:09.063
The Power Cosmic is so vague.

09:09.099 --> 09:10.932
What the hell does that
mean? What does that mean?

09:10.934 --> 09:12.433
It means he's a... he's a badass.

09:12.435 --> 09:14.769
He's like, "Aiyee!"

09:14.821 --> 09:16.571
I cannot believe you
don't dig the Silver Surfer.

09:16.606 --> 09:17.905
That's so disappointing to me, man.

09:17.941 --> 09:19.407
I feel like... I feel like taking a rock

09:19.442 --> 09:21.275
and just putting it right through that face

09:21.277 --> 09:23.361
right up there when you say you
don't like the Silver Surfer.

09:23.413 --> 09:25.029
I didn't say I don't like
him, I just said I don't know

09:25.081 --> 09:26.748
enough about him. I've
read so many other comics

09:26.783 --> 09:29.867
that, you know, he
was... he was down here.

09:29.919 --> 09:31.619
Stand your ground.
Don't worry about him

09:31.621 --> 09:32.754
- throwing a rock at your face.
- I'm just saying.

09:35.341 --> 09:37.091
This is a key issue for me.

09:37.127 --> 09:38.793
I have a lot of the first run.

09:38.795 --> 09:41.129
This is, like, the holy grail for me, um...

09:41.181 --> 09:42.263
Would you like to pop
it open, take a look at it?

09:42.298 --> 09:43.798
- Yes, I-I...
- Make sure?

09:43.800 --> 09:45.266
What if his hands aren't clean, bro?

09:45.301 --> 09:46.300
Well, he's not gonna touch it.

09:46.352 --> 09:47.769
Oh, okay.

09:47.804 --> 09:50.438
All right, so, issue number 3.

09:50.473 --> 09:52.140
- First appearance of Mephisto.
- Right.

09:52.192 --> 09:54.726
Really nice copy.
Very high grade as well.

09:54.778 --> 09:57.278
That's why we're looking to get 250 for it.

09:57.313 --> 09:58.946
What do you think?

09:58.982 --> 10:01.232
It's a little much for me.

10:01.284 --> 10:02.650
Um...

10:02.702 --> 10:04.402
Can you do 180?

10:04.454 --> 10:07.822
- 180.
- Mmm.

10:07.824 --> 10:10.792
I can knock 25 bucks
down. I can go to 225.

10:10.827 --> 10:13.127
That's still a little steep.

10:13.163 --> 10:17.415
Would you do 200 for it?

10:17.467 --> 10:18.966
We could do 200. I could do that.

10:19.002 --> 10:20.001
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

10:20.003 --> 10:21.469
I like it. 200 bucks.

10:21.504 --> 10:23.171
Let's see the money. Show me the money!

10:23.223 --> 10:24.756
Three, four, five.

10:24.808 --> 10:26.841
And he even had an extra 50 bucks in there.

10:26.843 --> 10:29.177
Huh? He even had more.

10:29.179 --> 10:30.344
He used the
Power Cosmic on you, man.

10:30.346 --> 10:31.763
He did. He did.

10:31.815 --> 10:33.014
- All right.
- Thank you, sir.

10:33.066 --> 10:34.482
Thank you.

10:34.517 --> 10:36.684
I got some, uh, Spider-Man history

10:36.686 --> 10:38.352
I thought you may want to check out.

10:38.404 --> 10:40.855
It's some, uh, letters
I've got from Steve Ditko,

10:40.907 --> 10:42.774
the creator of Spider-Man.

10:42.826 --> 10:44.025
They're very, very special.

10:46.277 --> 10:48.232
Did you have a
family board game night?

10:48.423 --> 10:49.528
Certain night of the week?

10:49.581 --> 10:51.530
The one time the
whole family did get involved

10:51.583 --> 10:54.700
in a game was not a board
game, but a gaming system.

10:54.752 --> 10:58.704
That triangular video
game system that had, like,

10:58.756 --> 11:00.923
the firing game and a racing game in it.

11:00.959 --> 11:05.044
And then the other one
was Pong. So many fights.

11:05.096 --> 11:07.546
Until my mother was
just like, "Never again!"

11:07.599 --> 11:09.966
And it went away till next Christmas.

11:10.018 --> 11:13.269
I think, like, uh,
a lot of board games, um,

11:13.304 --> 11:15.054
they take way too long.

11:15.106 --> 11:17.640
A lot of the siblings
and parents throw a board

11:17.692 --> 11:20.776
by the, uh, the first half hour
involved and they're just trying

11:20.812 --> 11:23.145
to cheat to get out of, uh...
"You won, let's get it over,

11:23.147 --> 11:24.730
let's watch some TV."

11:24.782 --> 11:26.315
Well, then the second
half hour, it encourages

11:26.317 --> 11:28.451
violence, obviously. People are fighting.

11:28.486 --> 11:31.070
There is no... no worse
fight than the family fight

11:31.122 --> 11:32.822
over a board game.

11:32.824 --> 11:36.158
You know, tears are rolling
and the, uh, voices are raising.

11:36.160 --> 11:38.794
And then somewhere in the midst
of it, there's some calmness

11:38.830 --> 11:41.664
inside of you going, "This is over Life.

11:41.716 --> 11:44.750
We have the game of
Life, not even real life."

11:44.802 --> 11:47.303
My parents almost got
divorced because of Uno, so,

11:47.338 --> 11:49.138
you know, it was a...

11:49.173 --> 11:51.090
It kinda scarred me off of, uh, games.

11:51.142 --> 11:53.009
They were like, "Marriage? Skip."

12:01.527 --> 12:02.943
Do you guys remember in The Matrix

12:02.995 --> 12:04.361
where they would upload a program,

12:04.363 --> 12:06.029
you could learn a skill immediately?

12:06.081 --> 12:07.614
Like, if there was one
skill that you could pick,

12:07.666 --> 12:09.666
- what would it be?
- Can I learn how to do

12:09.701 --> 12:12.202
"half, half, whole," like, perfect?

12:12.204 --> 12:13.537
Yeah, you... you
could... you could increase

12:13.589 --> 12:15.038
your sexual prowess like... like that.

12:15.090 --> 12:17.124
- Really? Yeah.
- What's that?

12:17.176 --> 12:18.792
"Half, half, whole"?

12:18.844 --> 12:22.879
You know, like, half, half, whole.

12:22.881 --> 12:24.464
- So...
- You got the swivel.

12:24.516 --> 12:26.016
I'm not saying that's what I want,

12:26.051 --> 12:28.802
but I really would love to know Spanish.

12:28.854 --> 12:32.722
I'd either want to know
"half, half, whole," or Spanish.

12:32.724 --> 12:34.307
I just feel like it would take years

12:34.359 --> 12:36.026
to learn another language.

12:36.061 --> 12:37.360
How long do you... do
you think it would take Mike

12:37.396 --> 12:39.146
to learn "half, half, whole"?

12:43.902 --> 12:47.070
Longer than it
takes him to learn Spanish.

12:51.627 --> 12:52.709
- Hey, man. How you doing?
- What's going on, man?

12:52.744 --> 12:54.244
- How are ya?
- Good.

12:54.296 --> 12:55.712
Got some, uh,
Spider-Man history I thought

12:55.747 --> 12:56.713
- you might want to check out.
- Sure.

12:56.748 --> 12:57.747
What do you got?

12:57.800 --> 12:59.049
Okay. Just open her up?

12:59.084 --> 13:00.750
Yeah, have at it.

13:00.752 --> 13:03.253
It's some, uh, letters
I've got from Steve Ditko,

13:03.305 --> 13:05.088
- the creator of Spider-Man.
- Really?

13:05.140 --> 13:07.674
So Steve Ditko sent you some letters?

13:07.726 --> 13:10.510
Yeah. He's like
my 88-year-old penpal.

13:10.562 --> 13:12.262
"Dear, Jeff. Everyone
who publicly does anything,

13:12.264 --> 13:14.264
"from the best to the poorest seller,

13:14.266 --> 13:17.267
"will find an audience,
followers, and critics.

13:17.319 --> 13:18.735
Regards, Steve Ditko."

13:18.770 --> 13:20.103
He's, you know, kinda out there.

13:20.105 --> 13:21.855
Speaks in riddles.

13:21.907 --> 13:23.440
Um, I actually... I kinda
actually agree with that.

13:23.442 --> 13:25.575
I think that's, uh, actually pretty poetic.

13:25.611 --> 13:27.194
Why did he send this to you?

13:27.246 --> 13:28.912
Some people in the
past had written him letters.

13:28.947 --> 13:31.248
I figured I'd give it a
shot, and he wrote back.

13:31.283 --> 13:32.949
- That's amazing.
- Believe it or not.

13:32.951 --> 13:34.784
Steve Ditko, for
those who don't know,

13:34.837 --> 13:37.287
is the co-father
of Spider-Man.

13:37.339 --> 13:38.788
I mean, and not just Spider-Man,

13:38.790 --> 13:40.457
- but you have The Question...
- Oh!

13:40.459 --> 13:42.876
Creeper, Hawk and
Dove. The list goes on and on.

13:42.928 --> 13:45.545
But Steve Ditko has kinda fallen out

13:45.597 --> 13:48.265
of the public eye for a long, long time.

13:48.300 --> 13:51.434
Kinda like the JD
Salinger of comic books.

13:51.470 --> 13:53.887
At a certain point, he just kinda went away

13:53.939 --> 13:55.305
and didn't interact with fandom.

13:55.357 --> 13:57.307
Became a bit more reculsive and whatnot.

13:57.359 --> 13:59.609
So to look into the life
of, like, one of the biggest

13:59.645 --> 14:03.063
creators in comic books ever
is pretty damn exclusive.

14:03.115 --> 14:05.148
Let's just take one of these nuggets

14:05.150 --> 14:07.617
- that, uh, that caught my eye.
- Okay, drop it, baby.

14:07.653 --> 14:09.152
"I see it was a mistake

14:09.154 --> 14:13.323
"clarifying you on young
Peter Parker/Spider-Man.

14:13.325 --> 14:16.293
"Now I'm supposed to fill you in
about my Marvel days as I know?

14:16.328 --> 14:19.079
Comic book fans are
always asking too much."

14:19.131 --> 14:20.914
- Ooh!
- "Fans." Yes!

14:20.966 --> 14:23.750
Like I said, I-I stepped
one over the... the line there.

14:23.802 --> 14:25.635
You probably asked
him, "What was it like

14:25.671 --> 14:27.087
to be hanging out with Stan Lee?"

14:27.139 --> 14:29.005
Yeah.

14:29.057 --> 14:30.840
Uh... they're... yeah,
they're really cool, man.

14:30.893 --> 14:32.475
Thanks for bringing them in.
I mean, they're pretty special.

14:32.511 --> 14:33.843
Yeah, I figured you'd appreciate 'em.

14:33.845 --> 14:35.762
They're very, very special.

14:35.814 --> 14:37.514
Is that... I mean is it... did you
bring them in for any other...

14:37.566 --> 14:38.815
I was looking to see if you guys

14:38.850 --> 14:40.267
were interested in buying them.

14:40.319 --> 14:42.185
- Oh, you want to sell them?
- Possibly.

14:42.187 --> 14:44.854
I'm not 100% committed to
selling them, but if you guys

14:44.907 --> 14:46.439
- are interested in them...
- Wow.

14:46.491 --> 14:48.191
To be able to kind
of pass them on to...

14:48.193 --> 14:50.193
You're 100% committed
if the price is right?

14:50.195 --> 14:51.494
- Sure.
- That's gotta be

14:51.530 --> 14:53.113
a little distasteful, right?

14:53.165 --> 14:54.831
I mean, you reach out to
the guy, he's good enough

14:54.866 --> 14:56.700
to write you back, and
now you want to sell them?

14:56.702 --> 14:58.451
I'm not looking to get
a million dollars out of them.

14:58.503 --> 15:00.537
I'm sure... I'm sure
he takes solace in that.

15:02.841 --> 15:05.508
I mean, he took the time
to write these personally...

15:05.544 --> 15:07.010
Well, I took the
time to write him too.

15:07.045 --> 15:08.545
Oh!

15:08.597 --> 15:10.797
Steve Ditko's running to the mail,

15:10.849 --> 15:13.016
"Oh, Jeff wrote me again. Thank God!"

15:13.051 --> 15:14.217
Didn't Ditko come in yesterday

15:14.269 --> 15:15.218
trying to sell his letters?

15:18.523 --> 15:22.225
Well, like I said, I'm not
100% interested in selling them,

15:22.227 --> 15:25.395
but if the number was right,
then I would consider it.

15:25.397 --> 15:27.564
And you're looking
to get how much for them?

15:27.616 --> 15:30.400
About 10,000.

15:30.452 --> 15:32.402
- $10,000?
- Yes.

15:32.404 --> 15:33.987
What, does he
get paid by the letter?

15:35.574 --> 15:37.157
He didn't learn
nothing from Spider-Man.

15:37.209 --> 15:39.576
Spider-Man in the beginning
wanted to use his powers

15:39.628 --> 15:41.411
for monetary gain.

15:41.463 --> 15:43.246
I don't think this
guy's gonna become Spider-Man.

15:45.250 --> 15:46.716
We appreciate you sharing it with us.

15:46.752 --> 15:48.051
No problem.

15:48.086 --> 15:50.003
Sharing it with us was pretty cool,

15:50.055 --> 15:52.055
but buying it is not something

15:52.090 --> 15:53.673
I think that we would have an interest in.

15:53.725 --> 15:54.924
No problem at all.

15:54.926 --> 15:56.559
Thank you for bringing it in.

15:56.595 --> 15:57.927
- Thanks for looking at it.
- I appreciate it.

15:57.980 --> 16:00.513
- All right, take care, man.
- All right.

16:00.565 --> 16:02.899
Which creator would you write to?

16:02.934 --> 16:04.768
Um...

16:04.820 --> 16:07.020
Probably Ditko because
he'll write back to anybody.

16:08.657 --> 16:10.940
Uh, I got some artwork
I want you to see here.

16:10.942 --> 16:13.943
Oh, wow.

16:20.311 --> 16:21.593
Hey, guys, how you doing today?

16:21.645 --> 16:23.095
- How you doing?
- Good.

16:23.147 --> 16:24.596
Uh, I got some artwork
I want you to see here

16:24.598 --> 16:27.305
- from Amazing Fantasy 15.
- Oh, wow.

16:28.068 --> 16:30.902
So wait. So these aren't the pages

16:30.938 --> 16:33.405
from the original Amazing Fantasy 15.

16:33.440 --> 16:34.856
Those are in the Library of Congress?

16:34.908 --> 16:36.408
- Right.
- So what are these, then?

16:36.443 --> 16:38.076
These are just reproduction art.

16:38.112 --> 16:41.446
So somebody went in
and redid the whole story?

16:41.448 --> 16:42.948
Exactly, yeah.

16:43.000 --> 16:44.282
They're spot-on, aren't they?

16:44.335 --> 16:46.335
They're gorgeous.

16:52.292 --> 16:54.042
Where did you get this from?

16:54.094 --> 16:57.095
I actually acquired it on a
trade through an online Website.

16:57.131 --> 17:00.132
Uh, a gentleman told me that
he acquired these in the '80s

17:00.134 --> 17:01.967
from an estate sale, and
that's where he left it.

17:01.969 --> 17:03.385
I mean, what's, like,

17:03.437 --> 17:04.770
one of the great mysteries of the world?

17:04.805 --> 17:06.304
What happened to Amelia Earhart?

17:06.357 --> 17:08.106
Who kidnapped the Lindbergh baby?

17:08.142 --> 17:09.891
Maybe this could be the new, uh, mystery

17:09.943 --> 17:11.560
of the, uh, unsolved mystery.

17:11.612 --> 17:13.228
I feel like people
are tired of talking

17:13.280 --> 17:15.063
about the Lindbergh
baby. Yeah, you're right.

17:17.034 --> 17:18.817
Everything you need to know about

17:18.868 --> 17:21.987
and tell a Spider-Man story is
right there in those 11 pages.

17:21.989 --> 17:24.790
It might be some of the most
succinct, brilliant writing

17:24.825 --> 17:26.657
ever done by a comic book writer.

17:26.660 --> 17:29.795
It packs so much within
such a small amount of space,

17:29.830 --> 17:31.329
and then the renderings as well

17:31.382 --> 17:33.331
just really bring that story to life, man.

17:33.384 --> 17:35.333
Ditko's art was beautiful
and told the story

17:35.386 --> 17:38.170
of a superhero that
kids hadn't seen before,

17:38.172 --> 17:40.172
someone that was more like them, their age,

17:40.174 --> 17:41.973
as opposed to an adult.

17:42.009 --> 17:46.011
It looks like they went
to a manic amount of detail

17:46.013 --> 17:47.596
to make it look like the legit deal.

17:47.648 --> 17:49.848
That was one of the
things that drew my eye to it.

17:49.850 --> 17:52.601
The book was originally supposed
to be slated for April of '62,

17:52.653 --> 17:55.353
and someone actually went off
and corrected it August '62.

17:55.355 --> 17:57.022
And then this is the
more fanned-out cloud line

17:57.074 --> 17:59.608
that they actually had on the
original 15 that Kirby did,

17:59.660 --> 18:01.193
and then, of course,

18:01.245 --> 18:04.162
the little wisp that
comes off the top bubble.

18:04.198 --> 18:06.832
You know who might be
able to solve the mystery?

18:06.867 --> 18:08.033
Rob Bruce, right?

18:08.035 --> 18:08.842
You want to give Rob Bruce a call?

18:08.842 --> 18:10.579
- You mind if we give him a call?
- No, do that.

18:10.579 --> 18:11.449
And also, do you mind

18:11.449 --> 18:13.043
if we take it back to the
poker table, lay them out,

18:13.301 --> 18:15.126
- and kind of soak it all in?
- Yeah, let's do that.

18:23.456 --> 18:24.877
- Hey, guys. Wow, look at that.
- What's up, Rob?

18:25.068 --> 18:28.562
It's pretty substantial.
So what's the deal?

18:28.562 --> 18:30.388
That's what we called you in for?

18:30.390 --> 18:32.390
He's hoping you have any knowledge

18:32.443 --> 18:34.860
where these pages may have come from?

18:34.895 --> 18:37.529
I really believe that
somebody sat in their basement

18:37.564 --> 18:39.865
and literally traced...
'cause there's no way

18:39.900 --> 18:42.150
that anybody could've hand-drawn this.

18:42.202 --> 18:43.902
I mean, this is extreme.

18:43.904 --> 18:45.821
Someone sweated
blood doing everything to...

18:45.873 --> 18:48.874
- A T.
- A T.

18:48.909 --> 18:51.543
But we don't know its origins at all.

18:51.578 --> 18:53.161
It's only right now speculation.

18:53.213 --> 18:54.579
It's a true mystery.

18:54.631 --> 18:55.997
So do you think

18:56.049 --> 18:58.250
it was just, like, the ultimate fan effort,

18:58.252 --> 19:00.919
or do you think it was
somebody trying to make a buck?

19:00.971 --> 19:03.421
Some lunatic, psychopath was like,

19:03.474 --> 19:04.890
"I'm gonna see if I can do it."

19:04.925 --> 19:06.391
But my kind of lunatic, psychopath.

19:06.426 --> 19:07.759
He was like, "I'm not gonna hurt others.

19:07.761 --> 19:09.427
I'm just gonna copy a comic book."

19:10.764 --> 19:12.430
My theory was, who cares?

19:14.134 --> 19:16.468
What would your best
guess be why this was made?

19:16.503 --> 19:17.936
I think it's a forgery.

19:17.988 --> 19:20.105
Just as they've attempted

19:20.107 --> 19:22.440
to make forgeries of the Mona Lisa

19:22.493 --> 19:24.276
or, you know, Starry Night by Van Gogh,

19:24.278 --> 19:26.111
it's on that level,

19:26.113 --> 19:27.913
'cause this book... I mean,
it's one of the few books

19:27.948 --> 19:30.582
that will actually sell for
more than a million dollars.

19:30.617 --> 19:32.751
But what would you pay for this?

19:32.786 --> 19:36.454
Probably $100 a page, $75 a page.

19:36.507 --> 19:37.923
What could it be worth?

19:37.958 --> 19:39.875
It's kind of like that "unknown."

19:39.927 --> 19:43.128
You know, taking in what Robert says,

19:43.130 --> 19:44.763
I still have interest in it

19:44.798 --> 19:46.131
if you're really looking
to sell them today.

19:46.133 --> 19:47.883
Yeah, definitely.

19:47.935 --> 19:49.968
What'll it take for
you to let them go today?

19:50.020 --> 19:53.555
Well, with what Rob said,
um, I'm thinking about a grand.

19:53.607 --> 19:55.640
Would you take $700 for it?

19:55.692 --> 19:57.976
I'm really stuck on that grand.

19:57.978 --> 20:00.145
Yeah.

20:00.147 --> 20:01.947
I can do 8.

20:01.982 --> 20:04.566
But I'm not gonna be able to
go more than $800 on the lot.

20:04.618 --> 20:06.785
No way you can do $900?

20:06.820 --> 20:09.254
No, I can't do it.

20:09.289 --> 20:11.239
All right, let's do 8.

20:11.291 --> 20:12.490
Take it?

20:12.543 --> 20:13.825
Take it. Give it a good home.

20:13.827 --> 20:15.627
All right, man, Got a deal.

20:15.662 --> 20:17.412
It's incredible. I
can't wait to see them framed.

20:17.464 --> 20:18.914
I'm gonna be really mad if I
come in here in, like, a year,

20:18.966 --> 20:20.332
and they're, like, 18,000.

20:20.384 --> 20:21.967
- No.
- Each.

20:22.002 --> 20:22.789
Maybe somebody out there

20:22.869 --> 20:24.637
knows where these pages came from.

20:24.671 --> 20:26.207
Maybe they'll contact the Stash

20:26.241 --> 20:28.645
and let us, you know, find out the mystery

20:28.679 --> 20:31.447
of the counterfeit Amazing Fantasy 15.

20:31.482 --> 20:33.849
And if you can't help
us figure out the mystery, kids,

20:33.884 --> 20:36.018
at least now you know you
can come into the Stash

20:36.053 --> 20:38.474
with the "Declaration of Independence"

20:39.294 --> 20:41.047
and probably sell it to Walt.

20:42.826 --> 20:46.464
***

20:46.464 --> 20:48.246
For Comic Book Men, I'm Kevin Smith.

20:48.246 --> 20:49.857

- Walt Flanagan.

20:49.857 --> 20:51.149

- Ming Chen.

20:51.277 --> 20:53.417
Rebember Kids, don't
ever let anyone tell you,

20:53.417 --> 20:56.351
you're not worth enough
to ***, good night.
