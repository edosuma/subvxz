00:32.540 --> 00:34.749
Greece, 1965

04:09.250 --> 04:10.790
Jacques, come quick!

04:10.916 --> 04:14.665
- It's shining!
- Quick, Jacques! It's shining in the harbour!

04:14.791 --> 04:16.874
Quick!

05:21.000 --> 05:22.999
There! You see it, Jacques?

05:23.125 --> 05:24.957
It's a coin.

05:25.083 --> 05:28.124
- It's mine! I saw it first!
- No, you liar!

05:28.250 --> 05:31.040
- Liar! Liar!
- We'll see who's lying!

05:32.666 --> 05:35.249
OK, I'll get it, but no fighting. All right?

05:35.375 --> 05:38.499
- We'll split it.
- You can't split a coin. It's stupid.

05:38.625 --> 05:41.832
- It's mine! I saw it!
- He's right! You're stupid!

05:42.875 --> 05:45.499
Then we'll buy something and split that.

05:58.166 --> 06:01.832
- Can you stop pointing? I've seen it.
- I've seen it, too.

06:10.916 --> 06:15.457
Well, if it isn't the little Frenchman!
How is the little Frenchman?

06:17.000 --> 06:18.499
Fine.

06:24.583 --> 06:27.082
You don't mind if I go instead, do you?

06:29.458 --> 06:31.582
If you did mind, you'd tell me, no?

06:31.708 --> 06:33.249
Yes.

06:37.583 --> 06:39.290
Good.

06:56.541 --> 06:58.165
Count!

07:27.833 --> 07:29.957
Whose is it now?

07:30.083 --> 07:32.665
You saw it, but I dove for it.

07:38.458 --> 07:41.374
- Roberto, how long?
- Six!

07:41.500 --> 07:43.540
I throw it back into the water.

07:43.666 --> 07:47.165
You dive, and if you do less than six,

07:47.291 --> 07:49.415
it's yours.

07:59.708 --> 08:02.374
Enzo, I saw the coin first.
We'll split it?

08:02.500 --> 08:05.040
We can't split a coin, stupid!

08:18.250 --> 08:21.165
Is it... a coin shining there?

08:22.083 --> 08:23.999
It is. It's a coin.

08:24.791 --> 08:26.874
I'll get it for you, Father.

08:28.041 --> 08:30.499
It will be for the poor.

08:41.500 --> 08:43.582
Father!

09:44.458 --> 09:46.499
Time to get up, Jacques.

10:51.833 --> 10:53.999
Shit.

11:19.458 --> 11:21.624
You shouldn't dive every day, Papa.

11:21.750 --> 11:24.665
Then you shouldn't eat every day, Jacques.

11:31.250 --> 11:33.707
Don't worry. When I am tired,

11:33.833 --> 11:35.915
the mermaids help me out.

12:29.791 --> 12:32.915
Hey, have you ever seen a mermaid?

12:35.416 --> 12:37.499
I've seen them.

12:38.416 --> 12:40.499
Don't you want to know where?

12:50.500 --> 12:52.499
Why don't you ask me?

12:52.625 --> 12:54.707
- What?
- Where I saw mermaids.

12:54.833 --> 12:58.790
Why don't you ever ask any questions?
I always ask the questions.

12:58.916 --> 13:02.457
Here we are, like two stones,
and now I'm talking to myself.

13:02.583 --> 13:05.207
Ask me something, goddamn it!

13:06.458 --> 13:08.499
Why did my mother leave?

13:09.166 --> 13:10.624
Pump.

13:18.083 --> 13:22.874
Your mother didn't leave.
She went back to America, that's all.

13:23.000 --> 13:25.040
It's her home.

13:25.166 --> 13:27.582
Women are like that.

13:27.708 --> 13:29.790
Unpredictable.

13:29.916 --> 13:32.124
Like the sea.

13:38.333 --> 13:41.332
Jacques! The water! Water!

13:42.000 --> 13:43.957
Help! I can't breathe!

13:44.083 --> 13:46.165
No!

13:53.416 --> 13:55.707
Daddy? Daddy!

14:11.666 --> 14:14.707
Wait! Stay here, Jacques!

16:22.500 --> 16:25.207
Yes! How did it happen?

16:25.333 --> 16:29.999
Well, uh... the company asked me to
extract everything I could from the wreck.

16:30.125 --> 16:34.040
And so the... the divers
were trying to get at the engine...

16:34.166 --> 16:37.665
and the boat just turned over
in the current!

16:39.291 --> 16:41.749
Look, I... I fucked up!

16:41.875 --> 16:43.582
Look!

16:44.375 --> 16:46.207
Can you help?

16:46.333 --> 16:48.374
How many are down there?

16:48.500 --> 16:53.915
There's just one. We're feeding him lots of air
but... he's not breathing properly.

16:54.041 --> 16:56.749
You've gotta get him outta there, fast!

17:00.500 --> 17:02.165
Ten thousand.

17:05.125 --> 17:06.707
Lire?

17:06.833 --> 17:08.749
Dollars.

17:11.790 --> 17:13.874
Hey, wait a minute!

17:14.000 --> 17:17.707
You guys aren't gonna try to
hold me up at a time like this?!

17:22.540 --> 17:24.457
OK, you tell me.

17:24.583 --> 17:27.374
How much would you say
a man's life is worth?

17:29.375 --> 17:31.332
In my village we have a saying.

17:33.291 --> 17:35.374
How does it go again?

17:37.458 --> 17:39.457
I don't remember.

17:39.583 --> 17:42.665
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Forget it.

18:05.666 --> 18:07.290
Enzo!

18:07.416 --> 18:10.165
Forza!

18:37.375 --> 18:40.582
Since we have a little time,
you write that cheque?

19:29.916 --> 19:31.957
How much longer can he do that?

19:32.083 --> 19:34.207
My brother...

19:34.333 --> 19:36.665
is a world champion.

19:36.791 --> 19:38.290
Sign.

20:52.666 --> 21:04.665
Bravo!

21:04.791 --> 21:06.999
Bravo! Bravo!

21:11.833 --> 21:14.415
Thanks! Bravo!

21:26.583 --> 21:28.374
Hey!

21:28.500 --> 21:30.499
Wait! Wait a minute!

21:30.625 --> 21:34.124
Wait a minute! Wait! Hey!

21:35.083 --> 21:37.415
Hey, thanks, you guys.

21:37.541 --> 21:39.582
Really. I mean it.

21:39.708 --> 21:41.457
You're welcome.

22:01.166 --> 22:04.207
Ten thousand dollars, Roberto!

22:27.333 --> 22:30.207
What are you gonna do with the money?

22:30.333 --> 22:32.374
Have the car painted.

22:32.500 --> 22:35.124
But Giuseppe will do that for 25 dollars.

22:38.291 --> 22:40.624
Then tell him to wax it, too.

23:02.125 --> 23:06.249
- What are you really gonna get?
- A rosary for Mamma...

23:06.375 --> 23:08.457
...a dress for Angelica...

23:10.125 --> 23:12.957
...and a suit that fits you.

23:18.000 --> 23:19.665
But most important...

23:22.208 --> 23:23.249
Yes?

23:25.958 --> 23:28.082
Find me the Frenchman.

23:31.333 --> 23:33.415
Find me Jacques Mayol.

25:30.291 --> 25:32.290
Are you Dr Laurence?

25:32.416 --> 25:35.290
No. I'm the assistant.

25:35.416 --> 25:37.499
Welcome to Peru.

26:32.875 --> 26:34.915
A drink to warm up?

26:35.041 --> 26:37.124
Yes, please.

26:37.250 --> 26:39.290
- Tea or whiskey?
- Both.

26:39.416 --> 26:43.624
Did... Did I just see a man
in a red suit and goggles?

26:43.750 --> 26:45.832
Right.

26:48.291 --> 26:50.665
The insurance person is here.

26:50.791 --> 26:53.207
It's about time.

26:54.833 --> 26:56.957
Johana Baker.

26:57.083 --> 26:59.499
Nice trip, eh?

27:02.958 --> 27:06.915
It's three weeks since the accident.
We're getting a little anxious.

27:07.041 --> 27:09.540
Franck, get out there. He's ready to go in.

27:09.666 --> 27:11.707
Right.

27:14.958 --> 27:17.832
First dive, two minutes.

27:37.125 --> 27:38.874
Who...

27:39.000 --> 27:41.082
Who is that?

27:41.208 --> 27:43.832
Mayol. Jacques Mayol.

27:44.958 --> 27:46.999
So those are your experiments?

27:47.125 --> 27:49.165
Dumping a guy in a frozen lake?

27:49.291 --> 27:51.874
The truck fell into a very deep crevasse.

27:52.000 --> 27:54.665
We weren't able to rescue the equipment.

27:56.083 --> 27:58.207
I'll have to talk to the driver.

27:59.125 --> 28:01.624
In the spring, when he melts.

28:06.708 --> 28:08.874
You really send him under the ice?

28:09.000 --> 28:11.999
He isn't a slave or a convict
or anything, is he?

28:12.125 --> 28:15.749
My dear, science is a cruel mistress.

28:25.208 --> 28:28.040
- How is he gonna breathe?
- He isn't.

28:39.625 --> 28:41.624
Listen.

28:41.750 --> 28:43.790
That's the sound of his heart.

28:43.916 --> 28:47.915
Can you hear the speed
at which it's slowing down?

28:48.041 --> 28:50.707
It's incredible!

29:09.083 --> 29:11.957
He's in the fluoroscope now.

29:14.333 --> 29:16.415
Listen to his heartbeat!

29:16.541 --> 29:18.582
I can't believe that!

29:18.708 --> 29:21.457
All the blood is concentrated in his brain.

29:21.583 --> 29:24.374
It doesn't even feed his limbs any more.

29:24.500 --> 29:28.957
That's a phenomenon that's only
been observed in whales and dolphins.

29:29.083 --> 29:31.207
Until now.

29:50.083 --> 29:52.707
Why is he doing this?

29:54.500 --> 29:56.582
I don't know.

30:57.666 --> 31:00.999
Shouldn't someone take him
a blanket or something?

31:31.291 --> 31:35.457
- I know you.
- We just met, a few minutes ago.

31:37.583 --> 31:41.665
- In the lake?
- No... In the hut.

31:54.666 --> 31:58.415
Then it must have been someone
who looked a lot like you.

33:10.166 --> 33:12.249
It's a present.

33:18.750 --> 33:20.749
Aren't you gonna open it?

33:37.500 --> 33:39.582
Are you here for a long time?

33:42.250 --> 33:44.165
Where do you live?

33:45.000 --> 33:46.665
In New York.

33:57.416 --> 33:59.499
It's been nice meeting you.

34:04.291 --> 34:07.040
Nice... meeting you, too.

34:48.875 --> 34:50.998
I'll only be five minutes.

35:22.458 --> 35:24.540
Clown.

35:26.166 --> 35:29.332
It's a llama.

35:40.166 --> 35:43.749
Darjeeling.

35:58.625 --> 36:00.832
I missed you rascals.

37:06.750 --> 37:08.999
Jacques, my friend.

37:10.041 --> 37:12.124
How are you?

37:12.708 --> 37:14.540
Enzo?

37:14.666 --> 37:18.207
I leave you swimming
and 20 years later you're still in the water.

37:18.333 --> 37:20.832
What the hell are you doing? Training?

37:22.125 --> 37:23.790
Yeah.

37:24.916 --> 37:26.957
Good.

37:30.875 --> 37:33.790
Check out the suit.

37:33.916 --> 37:35.999
Looking good, no?

37:36.125 --> 37:39.290
- You know I'm the world champion?
- Yeah, I know.

37:40.583 --> 37:44.499
The world championship
starts in ten days in Taormina.

37:45.541 --> 37:47.624
Be my guest.

37:48.750 --> 37:50.790
Your ticket.

37:50.916 --> 37:52.540
Why?

37:53.958 --> 37:56.499
Because I'm sure you're dying to beat me.

38:00.291 --> 38:02.957
You're the best, Enzo.

38:06.000 --> 38:08.624
See you there.

42:06.125 --> 42:08.165
I... I can't hear you!

42:08.291 --> 42:11.665
I said the snowmobile papers
are in the glove compartment.

42:11.791 --> 42:14.290
Get the customs office to send me a copy.

42:14.416 --> 42:17.999
We can't get you new equipment
until our file is complete.

42:18.125 --> 42:21.082
All right. You'll have them
by the end of the week.

42:21.208 --> 42:25.290
Great. You've made me a very happy
insurance person. Thank you.

42:25.416 --> 42:27.665
- All right. Goodbye.
- Dr. Laurence?

42:27.791 --> 42:29.165
Yes?

42:29.291 --> 42:33.582
You don't happen to know how I can
get in touch with that diver of yours?

42:33.708 --> 42:35.499
Jacques Mayol?

42:36.958 --> 42:41.499
The last I heard he was in Taormina,
at the World Diving Championships.

42:41.625 --> 42:43.457
In Sicily.

44:16.333 --> 44:18.499
Mayol... Mayol... No reservation.

44:24.958 --> 44:27.624
- Are you sure?
- Positive, sir.

44:28.875 --> 44:30.957
This is the Hotel San-Domenico?

44:31.083 --> 44:34.124
Yes, it has been so for 127 years.

44:44.666 --> 44:47.499
Be careful of that car.
It's a new paintjob. OK?

44:59.958 --> 45:02.165
So, you finally decided to join us.

45:02.291 --> 45:04.499
You did the right thing.

45:04.625 --> 45:06.457
Paolo, the key.

45:06.583 --> 45:09.165
You remember my little brother Roberto?

45:09.291 --> 45:12.415
- Hi.
- Hi, Roberto.

45:12.541 --> 45:15.582
- What room have you got?
- I haven't got one.

45:15.708 --> 45:18.165
You don't have a room? Paolo!

45:18.291 --> 45:22.499
What did I just hear? I call you to reserve
a room for my friend Jacques Mayol...

45:22.625 --> 45:24.707
and you treat him like a stranger!

45:24.833 --> 45:29.332
- It's OK, Enzo. I'll go somewhere else.
- Not only is he a very special friend.

45:29.458 --> 45:33.249
But he is one of the best divers
in the world. And you sling him out!

45:33.375 --> 45:35.707
Are you crazy or what?

45:37.541 --> 45:40.082
Drop it, Enzo. I'll find something.

45:44.125 --> 45:47.165
Take mine. I'll take the Countess's suite.

45:47.291 --> 45:50.040
She told me she was leaving
for the cemetery.

45:50.958 --> 45:53.457
She'll be more comfortable there! Ha!

45:58.708 --> 46:00.790
I'm glad you're here.

46:09.500 --> 46:15.249
So, after all these years, you must have
lots of questions to ask me. Am I right?

46:16.250 --> 46:18.874
Yeah, sure, lots of questions.

46:23.166 --> 46:25.290
Well, what are they?

46:30.500 --> 46:32.915
I don't know how to ask the questions.

46:36.708 --> 46:38.582
Are you married?

46:44.458 --> 46:46.499
Me neither. Because of my mother.

46:46.625 --> 46:48.707
She's a curse, my mother. Tornado.

46:48.833 --> 46:51.582
Stubborn as a mule.

46:51.708 --> 46:53.665
I was engaged for a week.

46:53.791 --> 46:57.374
After, Mamma was so mad,
the pasta was bouncing off the walls!

47:00.291 --> 47:02.374
So, not married.

47:02.500 --> 47:04.540
Good for you.

47:04.666 --> 47:08.040
You play the field, like me.
A girl in every port, eh?

47:08.166 --> 47:10.749
- After all, we're men!
- Damn right!

47:10.875 --> 47:14.582
That's what I tell them
when people say you've turned into a fish.

47:14.708 --> 47:16.290
People say that?

47:19.291 --> 47:21.374
Forget it! I was joking!

47:54.375 --> 47:57.457
I'll bet you my watch
that she's in my bed tonight.

48:04.375 --> 48:06.415
- You know each other?
- Yes!

48:06.541 --> 48:11.165
- Enzo Molinari. This is a great pleasure.
- Johana Baker. Nice to meet you.

48:11.291 --> 48:14.207
This is... a coincidence! It's unbelievable!

48:22.541 --> 48:24.624
Would you like to sit down?

48:29.708 --> 48:33.415
- I'm not interrupting anything, am I?
- No, not at all.

48:35.291 --> 48:39.374
- You staying at the hotel?
- It's full. But they recommended a pensione.

48:39.500 --> 48:43.540
- All of Taormina is full.
- It's the Free Diving World Championship.

48:43.666 --> 48:45.582
I am, by the way, world champion.

48:45.708 --> 48:50.374
- What are you doing in Sicily?
- I was doing an insurance claim in Palermo...

48:50.500 --> 48:53.707
and decided to take a few days off,
see the island.

48:53.833 --> 48:57.540
There is no place in the world
more beautiful than Sicily.

48:57.666 --> 49:01.207
Spaghetti del mare
for the super-dedicated insurance agent.

49:07.875 --> 49:11.207
As I was saying earlier,
I am the world champion free diver.

49:11.333 --> 49:14.540
Some people say it's
the most virile sport in the world.

49:14.666 --> 49:17.082
One has to admit that seeing those men...

49:17.208 --> 49:21.957
diving headfirst in that deep blue sea,
all muscles contracted...

49:22.083 --> 49:24.040
- Enzo...
- What?!

49:24.166 --> 49:26.415
- Mamma?
- Where?

49:26.541 --> 49:28.624
Wait.

49:30.875 --> 49:34.790
She'll kill me if she catches me
eating pasta in a restaurant.

49:34.916 --> 49:37.082
Eat up, quickly.

49:46.250 --> 49:49.124
You think I can carry these two bags
by myself?

49:49.250 --> 49:53.499
Mamma... Roberto and an elevator.
Isn't that enough?

49:54.583 --> 49:57.165
- What have you had today?
- Just a small coffee.

49:57.291 --> 50:01.624
I am diving tomorrow. Ah,
remember little Jacques? Jacques Mayol?

50:01.750 --> 50:03.790
And his friend, Johana.

50:04.375 --> 50:06.457
She is beautiful, no?

50:10.291 --> 50:12.540
Spaghetti del mare!

50:24.958 --> 50:27.040
I'm so hungry!

50:37.666 --> 50:39.624
Welcome!

50:58.000 --> 51:00.332
This is it.

51:07.250 --> 51:10.165
So, you're gonna be
really busy these days, eh?

51:10.291 --> 51:12.374
I don't know.

51:13.250 --> 51:14.832
Why?

51:14.958 --> 51:17.040
I... Because I...

51:18.125 --> 51:20.249
I don't know. I just thought...

51:21.875 --> 51:24.415
You have the competition, interviews.

51:24.541 --> 51:29.582
A competition like this requires
a great deal of concentration... Doesn't it?

51:37.333 --> 51:39.415
You can put down the bags now.

51:49.791 --> 51:54.249
We have to get ready for the ceremony.
The Tahitian is the new world champion.

51:54.375 --> 51:56.457
I'm tired. I don't feel like it.

51:57.541 --> 51:59.749
Roberto, the jacket.

52:01.000 --> 52:03.082
- This one?
- Yes.

52:08.833 --> 52:10.915
Very good.

52:15.041 --> 52:17.165
What about the shoes?

52:19.625 --> 52:21.207
Very chic.

52:21.333 --> 52:24.374
- You don't have anything else, do you?
- No.

52:24.500 --> 52:27.374
Then it's very chic. Let's go.

52:41.875 --> 52:45.207
Ladies and gentlemen,
your attention, please.

52:45.333 --> 52:49.915
Andre Bonnet, president of the International
Diving Championship Committee...

52:53.041 --> 52:55.332
this trophy to the new world champion.

52:55.458 --> 53:00.457
This afternoon, our new champion
descended to the remarkable depth...

53:00.583 --> 53:03.082
of 310 feet.

53:06.375 --> 53:08.457
A one-day hero.

53:10.958 --> 53:12.874
Mr President, if you please...

53:15.083 --> 53:17.207
A new world record. That's great.

53:17.333 --> 53:19.832
It gives me something to beat tomorrow.

53:19.958 --> 53:22.249
Have you ever been to Tahiti?

53:23.000 --> 53:26.790
I'll take you there. We'll live in the sun.
You'll cook fresh fish...

53:26.916 --> 53:29.790
and we'll make love
under the coconut trees.

53:29.916 --> 53:32.290
Hey, wait.
How about you do the cooking?

53:32.416 --> 53:34.499
And you forgot the hula.

53:34.625 --> 53:37.290
Excuse me.

53:45.666 --> 53:49.332
He looks strange, doesn't he?
Like a baby who just learned to walk.

53:50.916 --> 53:53.207
- Have you known him long?
- For ever.

53:53.333 --> 53:57.624
We used to live on the same island in Greece,
when we were kids.

54:00.250 --> 54:03.124
- What was he like when he was little?
- Little.

54:03.250 --> 54:05.249
Very little.

54:05.375 --> 54:07.415
That is, compared to me.

54:07.541 --> 54:10.957
- I get it, Enzo. You were a superior child.
- Exactly.

54:12.000 --> 54:14.124
What is it, Johana?

54:14.250 --> 54:17.707
You are so crazy about him,
you don't see the truth?

54:17.833 --> 54:22.040
Don't think of Jacques as a human being.
He is from another world.

54:24.166 --> 54:26.707
And just what world are you from, Enzo?

54:27.833 --> 54:29.415
Italia!

54:39.750 --> 54:41.790
And now, my friends,

54:41.916 --> 54:45.082
you are all invited for a drink
around the swim pool.

55:16.083 --> 55:19.874
Today, at lunch, you asked me
if I had any questions.

55:21.416 --> 55:23.957
You finally want to know about women!

55:26.041 --> 55:29.165
- Are they what's most important?
- No.

55:29.291 --> 55:31.374
It depends.

55:32.375 --> 55:34.457
Sometime they are.

55:36.083 --> 55:38.249
What exactly do you want to know?

55:39.041 --> 55:41.249
Everything.

55:42.541 --> 55:44.582
Everything about what?

55:46.916 --> 55:49.040
About everything.

56:07.791 --> 56:10.374
So, between Mamma,
Roberto and Alfredo,

56:10.500 --> 56:12.540
we yell and scream all day long.

56:12.666 --> 56:15.165
Except with Angelica. She just cries.

56:16.208 --> 56:19.874
And then, finally, we all end up kissing.

56:20.000 --> 56:22.040
Can you explain that to me?

56:26.000 --> 56:28.457
Because that's what love is all about.

56:28.583 --> 56:30.624
It's a pain in the ass,

56:30.750 --> 56:32.832
but it keeps us together.

56:35.416 --> 56:37.499
A large...

56:38.625 --> 56:40.749
and beautiful...

56:44.875 --> 56:47.082
family.

56:58.625 --> 57:00.915
We've gotta quit this competition.

57:01.041 --> 57:03.124
Why?

57:03.250 --> 57:05.665
Cos... if we don't,

57:05.791 --> 57:08.415
I'm gonna beat you.

57:14.875 --> 57:17.582
Do you hear that?

57:23.041 --> 57:25.082
- What?
- He looks me in the eye...

57:25.208 --> 57:27.249
like some fucking goldfish...

57:27.375 --> 57:30.832
and says..."I'm gonna beat you."

57:42.875 --> 57:45.165
That's what you guys are here for.

57:45.291 --> 57:47.332
Ha! Listen to her!

57:47.458 --> 57:49.749
That's what he's here for!

57:50.916 --> 57:54.249
He's here to lose!
That's what he's here for.

57:54.375 --> 57:56.874
First of all, I am unbeatable.

57:58.500 --> 58:00.165
Second...

58:00.291 --> 58:03.457
- How old are you?
- Two years younger than you.

58:03.583 --> 58:05.665
As I said,

58:05.791 --> 58:08.124
second of all, you're too skinny.

58:08.250 --> 58:13.624
You've got tiny lungs. I still don't understand
how you can dive without getting sick.

58:13.750 --> 58:19.624
The size of the lungs
has nothing to do with it.

58:19.750 --> 58:22.624
How long can you hold your breath?

58:24.458 --> 58:26.499
Longer than you.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.582
Hey! Take it easy! Jesus!

01:00:09.625 --> 01:00:11.749
Are you mad?

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.082
Come on, let me help you with this.

01:00:26.208 --> 01:00:28.415
- Who won?
- What? The Asshole Award?

01:00:28.541 --> 01:00:30.540
Let me tell you, it was a tie.

01:00:30.666 --> 01:00:33.207
Acting like a pair of two-year-olds.

01:00:33.333 --> 01:00:35.832
You could've died in that pool.

01:00:43.500 --> 01:00:45.957
Stop moving. You're rocking the boat.

01:00:46.083 --> 01:00:48.165
Luckily, I was there to save you.

01:00:52.500 --> 01:00:54.290
My wallet.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.790
- It's here.
- No, no. I wanna show you.

01:00:59.916 --> 01:01:01.999
Give it to me.

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:06.665
Sit down.

01:01:25.875 --> 01:01:27.999
That's my family.

01:01:42.625 --> 01:01:44.707
What kind of man...

01:01:45.416 --> 01:01:47.499
has such a family?

01:02:03.708 --> 01:02:05.790
It's OK.

01:02:11.041 --> 01:02:13.124
It's all right.

01:03:10.500 --> 01:03:13.207
All the medics are looking for you, Enzo.

01:03:13.333 --> 01:03:15.374
I am meditating! Can't you see?

01:03:15.500 --> 01:03:18.582
Jacques does two hours of yoga
before going down!

01:03:18.708 --> 01:03:20.790
I can have a five-minute nap!

01:03:35.875 --> 01:03:38.124
Mr Molinari, I am sorry,

01:03:38.250 --> 01:03:41.540
but you cannot dive
in this state of exhaustion.

01:03:46.458 --> 01:03:48.874
What do you know about the sea?
Nothing!

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.999
So you just take your tubes
and your tin cans away.

01:03:52.750 --> 01:03:54.790
The sea is mine.

01:03:54.916 --> 01:03:57.999
I know when she is ready for me
and when she isn't.

01:03:58.125 --> 01:04:00.249
And today she is ready.

01:04:01.958 --> 01:04:03.915
You dive at your own risk.

01:04:35.333 --> 01:04:37.290
One minute!

01:05:48.041 --> 01:05:50.499
Your trousers are too big for me.

01:05:56.916 --> 01:05:58.999
Where are they?

01:06:07.250 --> 01:06:11.040
- Where is everybody?
- They're gone.

01:06:11.166 --> 01:06:13.249
Something's wrong.

01:06:26.583 --> 01:06:28.624
You can't do that.

01:06:28.750 --> 01:06:30.790
What's the matter?

01:06:30.916 --> 01:06:32.915
I don't understand.

01:06:33.041 --> 01:06:35.415
I've tried for two days. They won't eat.

01:06:35.541 --> 01:06:37.540
They won't perform.

01:06:37.666 --> 01:06:39.790
Since we got a new one.

01:06:44.416 --> 01:06:47.124
It's finished for today.

01:06:47.250 --> 01:06:49.332
She's a new one.

01:06:50.833 --> 01:06:52.915
How can you tell it's a female?

01:06:54.916 --> 01:06:56.999
It's the way she moves.

01:08:35.791 --> 01:08:39.082
Don't be sad.
I only took back what was mine.

01:08:39.207 --> 01:08:41.290
Here. A present.

01:08:41.416 --> 01:08:46.207
Tonight we're having a little party
among ourselves. Eight o'clock in my suite.

01:08:48.750 --> 01:08:51.999
Mr Roberto, tell your brother
to be reasonable.

01:08:52.125 --> 01:08:54.582
Everybody's waiting for him upstairs.

01:08:54.707 --> 01:08:57.374
He can't! He's indisposed!

01:08:57.500 --> 01:08:59.540
Shall we call a doctor?

01:08:59.666 --> 01:09:02.415
No, no! La Mamma,
she is trying something!

01:09:05.625 --> 01:09:07.874
Mr Mayol, help us.

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:11.374
He refuses to receive his medal,
and everybody's waiting for him.

01:09:14.916 --> 01:09:17.624
- I'll do my best.
- That's very kind of you.

01:09:18.832 --> 01:09:20.415
It's Jacques!

01:09:22.207 --> 01:09:24.290
My friend! Come on in!

01:09:24.416 --> 01:09:27.165
Mr Molinari,
allow me to impress upon you...

01:09:27.291 --> 01:09:30.874
the importance of your attending
the award ceremony...

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.082
for the press.

01:09:33.207 --> 01:09:37.499
I think my brother told you I was indisposed.
That should do it, no?

01:09:37.625 --> 01:09:40.749
I am allowed to be indisposed, right?

01:09:40.875 --> 01:09:44.707
So you just go tell the press
that the big Enzo Molinari,

01:09:44.832 --> 01:09:49.665
overwhelmed by his inspiring descent
of 324 feet,

01:09:49.791 --> 01:09:52.540
will not be able to receive his trinket...

01:09:52.666 --> 01:09:54.290
because he is...

01:09:54.416 --> 01:09:56.540
- Hm?
...he is...

01:09:56.666 --> 01:09:58.499
Indisposed!

01:10:03.166 --> 01:10:05.207
Jacques, my friend!

01:10:05.333 --> 01:10:10.332
- Why don't you pick up your medal?
- Because pasta should be eaten al dente!

01:10:28.333 --> 01:10:30.415
Let me know how you find it.

01:10:59.958 --> 01:11:03.415
My office in New York.
It's really busy back there.

01:11:03.541 --> 01:11:05.582
I have so much work to do.

01:11:09.166 --> 01:11:11.915
- Do you want some?
- Oh, no.

01:11:34.458 --> 01:11:36.540
What's the matter?

01:11:37.750 --> 01:11:39.832
I have to ask you a favour.

01:11:49.666 --> 01:11:51.957
Hey, we're not stealing a dolphin, eh?

01:11:52.083 --> 01:11:54.749
No. I told you, we're just helping one out.

01:11:57.083 --> 01:11:58.290
Trying to help one out?

01:12:01.333 --> 01:12:03.624
Good.

01:12:18.833 --> 01:12:21.790
Taormina by night!
Lucky dolphin, eh?

01:12:25.291 --> 01:12:27.374
Yeah! Stairs!

01:13:14.083 --> 01:13:17.707
You can stop that now.
She has all the water she needs.

01:13:22.791 --> 01:13:26.332
All right, we did it!
Let's go back to the party.

01:13:46.750 --> 01:13:48.832
Five minutes, that's all! OK?

01:14:06.583 --> 01:14:08.665
Night.

01:14:08.791 --> 01:14:11.124
- Good night, Jacques.
- Good night.

01:14:17.625 --> 01:14:20.499
You don't need a stretcher
to take her with you.

01:14:20.625 --> 01:14:23.332
- You know that?
- What?

01:14:24.416 --> 01:14:28.665
Dolphins aren't the only ones
who don't feel very good sometimes.

01:14:30.583 --> 01:14:34.499
Jacques!
Can I watch you dive tomorrow?

01:14:49.583 --> 01:14:52.915
You really do have
a few things to learn about women.

01:15:26.250 --> 01:15:28.582
What do those guys do?

01:15:28.708 --> 01:15:30.749
They are paramedics.

01:15:30.875 --> 01:15:32.999
They wait at 200 feet.

01:15:51.666 --> 01:15:53.499
And him?

01:15:53.625 --> 01:15:56.582
That is the diver who goes below 300 feet.

01:15:56.708 --> 01:16:01.499
He dives with a helium-oxygen mixture.
Compressed air is too dangerous.

01:17:10.083 --> 01:17:11.749
Three minutes!

01:23:48.916 --> 01:23:51.499
He went down to 360 feet!

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:58.249
Congratulations, Jacques.
It's wonderful. I'm happy for you.

01:23:58.375 --> 01:24:01.915
Here.

01:24:02.041 --> 01:24:04.999
- What is it?
- Little presents. Nothing much.

01:24:06.208 --> 01:24:08.999
I knew it. I just knew it.

01:24:14.208 --> 01:24:15.749
Do you still collect them?

01:24:16.958 --> 01:24:18.999
You don't have that one, do you?

01:24:22.541 --> 01:24:24.832
It's beautiful. Thank you.

01:24:24.958 --> 01:24:27.040
It's nothing.

01:24:27.166 --> 01:24:29.207
I knew it. I told Roberto.

01:24:29.333 --> 01:24:32.790
He's very good, that little Frenchman.
Very good.

01:24:32.916 --> 01:24:34.499
Is this a poem?

01:24:34.625 --> 01:24:38.124
No, it's a recipe
for spaghetti frutti del mare.

01:24:41.291 --> 01:24:46.207
I was right in getting you out here.
You're a world champion, my friend.

01:24:57.833 --> 01:24:58.874
It's a measuring tape.

01:25:03.333 --> 01:25:05.540
You see? This is your record.

01:25:05.666 --> 01:25:08.040
Three feet more than mine.

01:25:09.500 --> 01:25:13.332
Looking at it from here,
it doesn't look like much, does it?

01:25:16.916 --> 01:25:20.124
Keep your little measuring tape, my friend.

01:25:20.250 --> 01:25:23.165
It will be a nice souvenir
when I beat you next.

01:30:38.166 --> 01:30:40.082
Did you have a nice night?

01:30:40.916 --> 01:30:42.499
Yeah.

01:30:46.250 --> 01:30:48.290
I was with the dolphin.

01:30:49.791 --> 01:30:51.165
All night?

01:30:52.333 --> 01:30:53.790
Yeah.

01:30:54.791 --> 01:30:57.832
- With the dolphin?
- Yeah.

01:31:04.083 --> 01:31:07.249
I gotta get back to New York.

01:31:12.291 --> 01:31:16.874
Because I have my job,
I have my work and my... life.

01:31:32.208 --> 01:31:34.290
Will you take me to the train station?

01:32:20.750 --> 01:32:23.665
If you're ever in New York,
give me a call, OK?

01:32:44.708 --> 01:32:47.999
- Can I come in?
- No problem. I enjoy talking in my sleep.

01:32:56.291 --> 01:32:59.207
Wake me up at 11.

01:33:24.500 --> 01:33:29.624
Why are you always talkin'? Nobody's
interested in what you're talkin' about.

01:33:29.750 --> 01:33:33.874
So just stop talkin'! Other people
have things to say! Understand?

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:36.374
Stop talkin'! It's bullshit!

01:33:36.500 --> 01:33:39.415
- She's gone?
- Yes, she's gone!

01:33:41.875 --> 01:33:43.874
Hey, I'm gonna take care of you.

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:46.249
I've got a job, on an oil rig.

01:33:46.375 --> 01:33:47.790
No sweat.

01:33:47.916 --> 01:33:49.999
I'm taking you along. OK?

01:33:50.125 --> 01:33:53.999
Come on, get your bags packed.
You're coming with me.

01:33:55.375 --> 01:33:57.457
You stupid bastard.

01:34:01.916 --> 01:34:04.749
We'll make a great team, the two of us.

01:34:04.875 --> 01:34:06.874
You'll see.

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:09.124
OK?

01:35:30.458 --> 01:35:32.749
100 feet.

01:35:38.916 --> 01:35:40.957
You're still thinking about her.

01:35:41.083 --> 01:35:44.374
Don't think about her any more.

01:35:44.500 --> 01:35:47.082
There are so many women in the world.

01:35:47.208 --> 01:35:50.624
Plenty of women everywhere. Right?

01:35:50.750 --> 01:35:52.790
Smoking is absolutely forbidden.

01:35:52.916 --> 01:35:54.915
It isn't lit yet.

01:35:55.583 --> 01:35:58.499
You shouldn't even
carry cigarettes on board.

01:36:00.208 --> 01:36:03.082
Listen, we're not supposed to piss, either.

01:36:03.208 --> 01:36:06.415
But that doesn't stop you
from carrying it on board.

01:36:06.958 --> 01:36:09.040
The rules are the rules.

01:36:10.250 --> 01:36:12.207
What's your name again?

01:36:13.041 --> 01:36:14.624
Noireuter.

01:36:14.750 --> 01:36:16.790
And where did you say you were from?

01:36:19.250 --> 01:36:20.749
Brussels.

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:42.290
I was 17.

01:36:42.791 --> 01:36:46.332
I loved her so much, I tried to die for her.

01:36:46.458 --> 01:36:48.499
Two years later,

01:36:48.625 --> 01:36:50.999
I couldn't even remember her name.

01:36:51.833 --> 01:36:56.374
Let me tell you,
time erases everything.

01:36:56.500 --> 01:36:58.249
I don't want to erase anything.

01:37:09.083 --> 01:37:11.915
450 feet. End of descent.

01:37:14.333 --> 01:37:17.290
We'll be left here for 50 minutes.

01:37:17.416 --> 01:37:19.915
What's with the voice?

01:37:20.041 --> 01:37:23.040
It's nothing.
Maybe the helium is up too high.

01:37:24.958 --> 01:37:28.749
- Does the voice come back?
- For others, yes.

01:37:28.875 --> 01:37:31.415
For you... Who knows?

01:37:34.416 --> 01:37:36.749
Try speaking to me.

01:37:37.541 --> 01:37:41.749
I don't find this funny.
We were having a serious conversation!

01:37:46.125 --> 01:37:48.207
It's OK for the helium.

01:37:49.625 --> 01:37:52.040
Here, give me your finger.

01:37:53.583 --> 01:37:56.874
Is that alcohol?
That's really forbidden!

01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:59.790
Hey, do you have any other complaints?

01:37:59.916 --> 01:38:03.332
Make a list and we'll stick it
on the porthole. OK?

01:38:03.458 --> 01:38:07.415
- Suck your finger.
- Stop kidding around. It's...

01:38:07.541 --> 01:38:09.999
It's dangerous at this pressure - alcohol.

01:38:11.750 --> 01:38:14.165
Enzo, it's very deep down here.

01:38:14.291 --> 01:38:16.374
Come on, suck your finger.

01:38:23.500 --> 01:38:26.332
Ah, you'll be seeing
mermaids everywhere.

01:38:33.083 --> 01:38:37.832
A thousand commanders and we get
the Belgian from Alcoholics Anonymous!

01:38:54.250 --> 01:38:56.207
Are we clear?

01:39:17.458 --> 01:39:20.332
Can you hear me?

01:42:50.500 --> 01:42:52.582
It's Johana.

01:42:53.583 --> 01:42:55.290
How are you?

01:42:58.708 --> 01:43:00.332
I got fired.

01:43:01.666 --> 01:43:03.707
I got this job with Enzo.

01:43:03.833 --> 01:43:05.874
We got fired, too.

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:08.082
Really?

01:43:10.041 --> 01:43:11.915
It's strange.

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:21.040
Talk to me some more.

01:43:21.166 --> 01:43:25.332
It's hard. I don't know what else to say.
You're so far away.

01:43:27.250 --> 01:43:29.332
Tell me a story.

01:43:31.166 --> 01:43:33.249
A story?

01:43:36.875 --> 01:43:39.707
Do you know how it is...

01:43:39.833 --> 01:43:43.040
Do you know what you're supposed to do
to meet a mermaid?

01:43:47.208 --> 01:43:49.582
You go down to the bottom of the sea...

01:43:50.375 --> 01:43:53.332
where the water isn't even blue any more...

01:43:53.458 --> 01:43:55.457
and the sky is only a memory...

01:43:55.583 --> 01:43:58.540
and you float there, in the silence,

01:43:59.541 --> 01:44:01.624
and you stay there...

01:44:03.125 --> 01:44:05.999
and you decide... that you'll die for them.

01:44:06.125 --> 01:44:08.582
Only then do they start comin' out.

01:44:08.708 --> 01:44:13.332
They come, and they greet you,
and they judge the love you have for them.

01:44:14.333 --> 01:44:16.415
If it's sincere,

01:44:17.875 --> 01:44:19.957
if it's pure,

01:44:21.541 --> 01:44:23.624
they'll be with you...

01:44:24.625 --> 01:44:26.707
and take you away for ever.

01:44:34.541 --> 01:44:37.040
I like that story.

01:46:34.916 --> 01:46:36.499
What is it?

01:46:38.333 --> 01:46:40.415
I think I love you.

01:47:15.375 --> 01:47:17.415
You live here?

01:47:17.541 --> 01:47:20.040
Yeah. Sometimes.

01:47:35.666 --> 01:47:38.207
- Who's that?
- That's my Uncle Louis.

01:47:45.708 --> 01:47:47.874
I can't get him out of the bathtub.

01:48:04.583 --> 01:48:06.165
Assassin!

01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:10.499
Uncle Louis!
This is my friend Johana!

01:48:13.291 --> 01:48:15.332
Johana is visiting me!

01:48:15.458 --> 01:48:17.499
He's a bit deaf. He's 75.

01:48:17.625 --> 01:48:20.624
It's very nice to meet you, Uncle Louis!

01:48:42.333 --> 01:48:45.540
So, where are you from, Henrietta?

01:48:45.666 --> 01:48:47.999
Johana! New York!

01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:52.707
New York? What kind of name is that?

01:48:52.833 --> 01:48:56.415
- No, I'm from New York.
- Oh, yeah!

01:48:57.541 --> 01:49:00.332
The best legs are from New York!

01:49:04.541 --> 01:49:06.582
Uncle Louis...

01:49:08.416 --> 01:49:10.540
Johana is my friend.

01:49:16.083 --> 01:49:18.790
She's come to... stay with me...

01:49:20.791 --> 01:49:22.832
for a while.

01:49:22.958 --> 01:49:26.040
Good. That way I'll see more of you.

01:49:26.166 --> 01:49:28.207
Where are you gonna stay?

01:49:29.208 --> 01:49:33.457
- Here.
- Here? In my apartment?

01:49:34.208 --> 01:49:36.249
It's my apartment.

01:49:36.375 --> 01:49:39.499
Liar! Cheat! Torturer!

01:49:39.625 --> 01:49:42.790
Uncle Louis, go back to your bathtub.

01:49:43.791 --> 01:49:45.957
I'm going to put a lock on the telephone.

01:49:49.375 --> 01:49:51.999
Have some more wine, Uncle Louis.

01:49:54.458 --> 01:49:56.999
Thank you, Henrietta.

01:49:57.583 --> 01:49:59.665
I'll change my name.

01:50:16.750 --> 01:50:18.790
This is, er...

01:50:18.916 --> 01:50:20.832
my room.

01:50:37.625 --> 01:50:42.332
Enzo phoned. He's coming over next week
for another competition.

01:50:45.458 --> 01:50:48.374
Are you gonna compete, too?

01:50:48.500 --> 01:50:49.790
Yeah.

01:50:58.833 --> 01:51:01.165
Are you sure you'll be all right here?

01:51:53.833 --> 01:51:55.874
It's not like him to be late.

01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:58.249
Of course,
sometimes he doesn't show up at all.

01:51:59.666 --> 01:52:01.832
Two dollars?!

01:52:01.958 --> 01:52:05.832
You didn't even need to catch the fish!

01:52:05.958 --> 01:52:08.707
It died of cancer!

01:52:22.958 --> 01:52:26.957
- Where did you get that?
- That? This is not a "that".

01:52:27.083 --> 01:52:30.665
This is Bonita Mariposa,
the famous Spanish actress,

01:52:30.791 --> 01:52:34.082
who is going to be very careful
with the varnish...

01:52:35.208 --> 01:52:37.915
...and who is spending
a few days with us.

01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:46.832
- Where is Mamma?
- You have 8 hours before she gets here.

01:52:51.666 --> 01:52:55.707
He's really going totally deaf.

01:52:55.833 --> 01:52:58.457
I'm not as deaf as you are blind!

01:52:59.625 --> 01:53:03.374
You take care of your eyes,
and I'll take care of my ears!

01:53:03.875 --> 01:53:06.207
I'm sorry, Uncle Louis.

01:53:07.958 --> 01:53:10.040
Come on, drink up, my boy!

01:53:20.625 --> 01:53:23.457
Hey, tell me, what century are you in?

01:53:23.583 --> 01:53:25.957
Second.

01:53:33.583 --> 01:53:35.624
What's going on here?

01:53:35.750 --> 01:53:38.415
We're listening to some music.
With Enzo.

01:53:41.500 --> 01:53:44.665
- This is Dr Laurence.
- Ah!

01:53:45.666 --> 01:53:48.957
So, you must be the famous
Enzo Molinari.

01:53:49.083 --> 01:53:52.165
In the flesh! I have that honour.

01:53:57.791 --> 01:54:01.040
God... I'm getting wrinkles.

01:54:01.166 --> 01:54:04.165
Mm-hm. And I'm getting pimples.

01:54:06.458 --> 01:54:08.957
So, are you gonna live here permanently?

01:54:09.083 --> 01:54:11.874
I don't know.
Things have happened so fast.

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:14.082
We haven't even talked about it.

01:54:15.791 --> 01:54:18.124
You're very much in love. I can tell.

01:54:22.458 --> 01:54:24.415
You have that look.

01:54:25.625 --> 01:54:27.957
The look of a woman who wants a baby.

01:54:31.958 --> 01:54:34.415
I haven't even thought of having a baby.

01:54:34.541 --> 01:54:38.915
God, we're just... starting
to get to know each other. It'd be really...

01:54:39.041 --> 01:54:40.999
Do I really?

01:54:41.125 --> 01:54:43.832
Well, maybe he's not quite ready, but...

01:54:44.583 --> 01:54:46.665
he's a nice guy, sensitive.

01:54:49.875 --> 01:54:53.082
Well, I can't have a baby by myself.

01:54:53.208 --> 01:54:55.624
Why not? I have a baby.

01:54:55.750 --> 01:54:57.749
I loved his father.

01:54:57.875 --> 01:55:00.124
We're not together any more but...

01:55:00.250 --> 01:55:02.332
I have his baby.

01:55:04.666 --> 01:55:07.665
At the end, you do it alone anyway.

01:55:27.166 --> 01:55:29.540
Enzo Molinari for classification.

01:55:41.375 --> 01:55:43.457
What was his last time?

01:55:45.208 --> 01:55:48.124
I don't know, but it was really long.

01:56:57.333 --> 01:56:59.082
Hey, that's not bad.

01:57:06.041 --> 01:57:08.124
Very good, Enzo. Very good.

01:57:21.208 --> 01:57:23.707
So what? Anybody can have a bad day.

01:57:23.833 --> 01:57:27.249
Well, I've had many,
when the sea doesn't want you.

01:57:27.375 --> 01:57:31.665
It's never the sea.
It's Mamma, Roberto, that stupid actress!

01:57:33.666 --> 01:57:35.749
Don't break my balls.

01:58:32.208 --> 01:58:34.332
Did you have a nice day?

01:58:35.375 --> 01:58:37.624
Enzo had a bad day.

01:58:40.375 --> 01:58:41.957
Did you dive?

01:58:46.958 --> 01:58:48.915
No, it didn't feel right.

01:58:56.375 --> 01:59:00.499
It's a cute baby, eh?
I love that baby.

02:00:47.791 --> 02:00:50.290
Let them try.

02:02:28.500 --> 02:02:30.415
Is he OK?

02:03:03.666 --> 02:03:05.749
What are they doing?

02:03:06.375 --> 02:03:08.290
I don't know.

02:03:50.250 --> 02:03:52.332
Great time!

02:04:07.333 --> 02:04:09.415
How was it?

02:04:10.750 --> 02:04:12.790
It was dangerous.

02:04:12.916 --> 02:04:14.999
380 feet,

02:04:15.125 --> 02:04:17.874
four minutes and 50 seconds underwater.

02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:20.332
Great.

02:04:30.458 --> 02:04:32.290
Thank you. Thank you very much.

02:04:37.125 --> 02:04:39.957
My son, bravo!

02:04:43.875 --> 02:04:45.540
Now...

02:04:47.666 --> 02:04:53.082
I am sure you heard some people suggest
it is too dangerous for us to continue.

02:04:53.208 --> 02:04:55.999
Dangerous because
we don't know how to measure...

02:04:56.125 --> 02:04:59.832
the physiological consequences
of this type of dive.

02:04:59.958 --> 02:05:04.624
And also because the scuba divers
are not used to going down below 300 feet.

02:05:06.333 --> 02:05:08.374
- But...
- What's he saying?

02:05:08.500 --> 02:05:10.999
...we asked the free divers,

02:05:11.125 --> 02:05:13.290
and they all insist...

02:05:13.416 --> 02:05:16.165
that the competition continue.

02:05:24.125 --> 02:05:27.249
Good luck to you all. Good luck.

02:06:41.875 --> 02:06:43.999
One minute!

02:08:34.125 --> 02:08:36.165
You can't stay here!

02:09:03.791 --> 02:09:05.457
Do you see him?

02:09:08.583 --> 02:09:10.499
Hey! Do you see him?

02:09:26.583 --> 02:09:28.624
Jacques!

02:10:22.125 --> 02:10:23.915
400 feet.

02:10:24.041 --> 02:10:27.457
400 feet!

02:10:43.583 --> 02:10:45.499
You all right?

02:10:55.166 --> 02:10:57.124
I'll be right there!

02:10:57.250 --> 02:10:58.332
Hi! Come on in.

02:10:59.208 --> 02:11:02.415
- No. I wanted to say goodbye.
- You're leaving?

02:11:02.541 --> 02:11:06.790
Yes.
Could you please give this to Enzo?

02:11:11.541 --> 02:11:13.624
It's no use.

02:11:14.625 --> 02:11:18.874
Just tell him I said goodbye,
and give him a kiss for me. OK?

02:11:19.875 --> 02:11:22.374
- Promise?
- Promise.

02:11:24.791 --> 02:11:27.290
Maybe you shouldn't give up so easily.

02:11:28.625 --> 02:11:30.749
Here's a present for you.

02:11:35.166 --> 02:11:37.290
It's your baby.

02:11:41.833 --> 02:11:44.374
Believe me, it will change your life,

02:11:44.500 --> 02:11:46.499
only for the better.

02:11:49.750 --> 02:11:51.999
You take care of yourself, Johana.

02:11:52.916 --> 02:11:54.999
You, too.

02:14:05.875 --> 02:14:08.499
Welcome to Greece, Jacques!
How are you?

02:14:08.625 --> 02:14:10.874
Welcome, Johana. Have a good trip?

02:14:11.000 --> 02:14:14.374
OK, let me give you all the information.
Come with me.

02:14:32.916 --> 02:14:34.999
This is making me sick.

02:14:36.916 --> 02:14:38.999
Why?

02:14:40.583 --> 02:14:42.749
Would you give me a glass of water?

02:15:04.416 --> 02:15:06.499
Nervous about the competition?

02:15:14.750 --> 02:15:16.874
What's it feel like when you dive?

02:15:23.250 --> 02:15:26.040
It's a feeling of slipping without falling.

02:15:28.166 --> 02:15:30.749
The hardest thing is when
you hit the bottom.

02:15:33.750 --> 02:15:35.249
Why?

02:15:39.625 --> 02:15:42.957
Because you have to find
a good reason to come back up.

02:15:43.083 --> 02:15:45.249
And I have a hard time finding one.

02:15:53.083 --> 02:15:55.165
Well, we have the same problem.

02:15:58.000 --> 02:15:59.040
Why?

02:15:59.166 --> 02:16:02.915
Because I have a hard time
finding a good reason to stay.

02:16:25.958 --> 02:16:28.040
I found one.

02:16:44.250 --> 02:16:46.040
Is he here?

02:16:47.790 --> 02:16:49.249
Yeah.

02:16:51.875 --> 02:16:53.540
Good.

02:17:36.833 --> 02:17:39.665
It scares me when you look
at the sea like that.

02:17:46.333 --> 02:17:48.874
I used to dive here when I was a boy.

02:17:52.250 --> 02:17:54.999
I have something
I want to talk to you about.

02:17:55.125 --> 02:17:57.207
Not here.

02:18:20.165 --> 02:18:22.249
Can we talk here?

02:18:42.500 --> 02:18:44.582
Let's talk about my world.

02:18:47.165 --> 02:18:48.999
My world is you.

02:18:55.000 --> 02:18:57.124
I love you.

02:18:59.915 --> 02:19:02.040
I wanna live with you.

02:19:03.500 --> 02:19:05.582
I wanna have a baby with you.

02:19:07.333 --> 02:19:09.374
I wanna have a house with you.

02:19:09.500 --> 02:19:12.665
A car with you. A dog with you.

02:19:12.790 --> 02:19:14.749
You know?

02:19:14.875 --> 02:19:18.124
Jacques, I think I might be pregnant!

02:19:23.208 --> 02:19:25.249
Did you hear me?

02:20:14.750 --> 02:20:16.832
Tomorrow is going to be a big day.

02:21:45.250 --> 02:21:49.499
When I analysed the data from
Mayol's last dive, it became apparent.

02:21:49.625 --> 02:21:53.415
At the depths these men are diving,
it is a physiological impossibility...

02:21:53.541 --> 02:21:57.249
that they could retain enough oxygen
to make it to the surface.

02:21:57.375 --> 02:22:02.540
The pressure is so strong, it stops the oxygen
from circulating through the body.

02:22:03.208 --> 02:22:05.832
To attempt to break Mayol's record now...

02:22:05.958 --> 02:22:08.082
is simple suicide.

02:22:10.375 --> 02:22:12.290
Do you understand?

02:22:13.625 --> 02:22:15.707
Yes, I understand.

02:22:16.958 --> 02:22:19.082
Today is just training.

02:22:21.291 --> 02:22:24.499
- Molinari is a 17-time world champion.
- Three minutes!

02:22:24.625 --> 02:22:26.707
Do you want to tell him he can't dive?

02:22:32.500 --> 02:22:34.457
Cancel the competition.

02:22:41.750 --> 02:22:43.832
Two minutes!

02:22:49.333 --> 02:22:51.249
Get Mayol in here.

02:22:57.083 --> 02:22:59.165
One minute!

02:23:14.583 --> 02:23:17.082
They wanna cancel the competition.

02:23:17.208 --> 02:23:19.290
For a while.

02:23:20.458 --> 02:23:22.290
Why?

02:23:23.625 --> 02:23:25.707
It's not safe, they say.

02:23:30.125 --> 02:23:32.207
The doctors say...

02:23:33.541 --> 02:23:36.082
we can't go deeper and survive.

02:23:38.083 --> 02:23:40.582
You say that because you have the title.

02:23:42.250 --> 02:23:44.332
I would never cheat you.

02:23:47.625 --> 02:23:49.707
That's very nice of you.

02:23:57.500 --> 02:24:00.457
Oh, Jesus!
I told you to tell him not to go!

02:24:00.583 --> 02:24:02.707
It's not my fault! I told him!

02:24:07.625 --> 02:24:09.665
- No, no, no!
- And then they die!

02:24:09.791 --> 02:24:12.957
It's the first time
I've organised a competition!

02:25:25.250 --> 02:25:26.874
Wonderful!

02:25:38.416 --> 02:25:40.040
Get away!

02:25:40.166 --> 02:25:41.874
Will you get away?!

02:25:42.000 --> 02:25:43.457
Goddamn it!

02:25:43.583 --> 02:25:45.874
Get away!

02:25:46.000 --> 02:25:49.082
- Give him some time! Leave him alone!
- Out!

02:25:52.000 --> 02:25:53.665
Clear off!

02:26:12.833 --> 02:26:15.374
You were right.

02:26:17.875 --> 02:26:19.540
About what?

02:26:20.958 --> 02:26:23.082
It's much better down there.

02:26:27.083 --> 02:26:29.124
It's a better place.

02:26:45.750 --> 02:26:47.874
Push me back in the water.

02:26:49.583 --> 02:26:51.624
No, I can't.

02:26:58.375 --> 02:27:00.665
Take me back down.

02:27:08.333 --> 02:27:10.207
Please.

02:28:04.375 --> 02:28:05.707
Hey, look!

02:28:50.750 --> 02:28:54.332
- Up with the arms... Over the top...
- Come on, Jacques.

02:28:57.583 --> 02:28:59.790
Let's get a heartbeat.

02:28:59.916 --> 02:29:01.790
Come on, breathe!

02:29:01.916 --> 02:29:04.665
Come on, Jacques. Come on, Jacques!

02:29:10.291 --> 02:29:12.790
Come back, Jacques!

02:29:36.625 --> 02:29:39.207
Jacques! Stay with us!

02:30:04.125 --> 02:30:06.207
Good. Good.

02:30:06.333 --> 02:30:08.790
Good boy.

02:30:13.791 --> 02:30:15.874
Very good.

02:30:35.333 --> 02:30:37.415
Here.

02:30:41.750 --> 02:30:43.832
Get some sleep.

02:31:04.041 --> 02:31:06.124
We'll talk later.

02:31:09.125 --> 02:31:11.165
You sleep now.

02:31:22.541 --> 02:31:24.624
I love you.

02:31:30.875 --> 02:31:34.665
Doctor Laurence...
This just arrived for you.

02:31:56.750 --> 02:31:58.832
I wasn't on the boat.

02:32:05.083 --> 02:32:07.165
The only time in 20 years,

02:32:09.916 --> 02:32:11.999
and I wasn't on the boat.

02:32:17.416 --> 02:32:22.457
I must go now, tell Mamma.

02:32:49.125 --> 02:32:52.290
I know this isn't a good time for this, but...

02:32:52.416 --> 02:32:54.915
I have the results of your test here.

02:32:55.916 --> 02:32:57.749
Yes, you're pregnant.

02:33:08.750 --> 02:33:10.790
Are you happy?

02:33:11.833 --> 02:33:14.124
- Yes.
- Good.

02:33:14.250 --> 02:33:16.290
I'm happy.

02:33:18.458 --> 02:33:20.499
I'm scared,

02:33:20.625 --> 02:33:22.707
but I'm happy.

02:33:24.041 --> 02:33:25.832
So...

02:33:25.958 --> 02:33:28.290
no more ouzo.

02:33:29.500 --> 02:33:31.624
No more cigarettes.

02:33:34.750 --> 02:33:36.790
- You take care.
- Thank you.

02:37:15.958 --> 02:37:18.332
What is it? Talk to me!

02:37:23.875 --> 02:37:25.957
OK. Wait a minute.

02:37:26.833 --> 02:37:28.832
Let's talk to Laurence.

02:37:28.958 --> 02:37:31.082
What are you doing?

02:37:31.208 --> 02:37:33.249
Please, please don't do this.

02:37:33.375 --> 02:37:35.207
Look, don't do this!

02:37:35.333 --> 02:37:37.457
Why are you doing this?

02:37:46.208 --> 02:37:48.290
Jacques... Just talk to me!

02:38:36.541 --> 02:38:38.415
I've got to go and see.

02:38:40.000 --> 02:38:42.082
See what?

02:38:42.541 --> 02:38:44.707
There's nothing to see, Jacques!

02:38:44.833 --> 02:38:46.874
It's dark down there! It's cold!

02:38:47.000 --> 02:38:49.374
You'll be alone!

02:38:49.500 --> 02:38:53.624
And I'm here! I'm real! I exist!

02:39:28.166 --> 02:39:30.415
I'm pregnant.

02:39:38.041 --> 02:39:41.082
Didn't you hear me?

02:40:58.717 --> 02:41:00.800
Go.

02:41:00.883 --> 02:41:03.092
Go and see, my love.
