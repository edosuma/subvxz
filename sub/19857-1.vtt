I got a lot of things to do today.

Thank you.

Hey!

Claude!

Come here!
I want to show you something.

Just come here, please.

I don't know.

28:17.654 --> 28:21.115

There. See?

Hello.

29:27.348 --> 29:29.250
Ted, Ted...

29:49.454 --> 29:51.872
Excuse me. Mr. Berger?

29:51.873 --> 29:54.333
- You can call me George.
- I think that it's a private party.

29:54.334 --> 29:57.503
I think you and your friends
better leave, please.

29:57.504 --> 30:01.113
- You do?
- Yes, I think that's the thing to do.

30:01.925 --> 30:03.437
OK.

30:06.846 --> 30:08.764
Mr. Berger...

30:08.765 --> 30:09.837
Excuse me, everybody.

30:09.849 --> 30:12.434
- Everybody, please quiet down.
- Mr. Berger...

30:12.435 --> 30:14.812
I think that you and your...

30:14.813 --> 30:16.522
I just wanted to say a few words,
then we'll go.

30:16.523 --> 30:20.067
- I don't care what you have to say.
- I know. Everybody, listen.

30:20.068 --> 30:21.860
- We weren't invited to this party...
- Mr. Berger.

30:21.861 --> 30:25.531
Just a second.
I just want to talk for a second, OK?

30:25.532 --> 30:28.700
- I don't care about that.
- I know you don't care.

30:28.701 --> 30:30.869
- I think you better leave.
- Please, just give me two minutes.

30:30.870 --> 30:32.412
Just wanna talk to
the people for a second.

30:32.413 --> 30:35.040
- All right?
- No.

30:35.041 --> 30:37.417
- Please.
- No, I think you better go.

30:37.418 --> 30:38.979
Please.

30:39.879 --> 30:42.631
I'm losing my patience.
This is a private party.

30:42.632 --> 30:44.842
You were not invited.
You'd better leave.

30:44.843 --> 30:46.927
- You don't understand.
- I have nothing to understand.

30:46.928 --> 30:47.952
You got something to understand.

30:47.971 --> 30:49.972
You don't understand what this man
will be doing for you.

30:49.973 --> 30:52.933
- I don't want to hear about it.
- You should hear about it!

30:52.934 --> 30:55.227
- You know what he's gonna do for you?
- I don't care!

30:55.228 --> 30:59.064
You should care because
he's gonna be fighting for you.

30:59.065 --> 31:01.733
He's going to Vietnam to fight for you,
to save your life!

31:01.734 --> 31:04.152
- I don't care what he's gonna do.
- To save your life!

31:04.153 --> 31:05.654
Or what you're gonna do.

31:05.655 --> 31:08.093
- I want you out!
- You should care!

31:09.659 --> 31:13.495
If you want me out of here,
you'll have to throw me out.

31:13.496 --> 31:16.130
That's exactly what I'm gonna do.

31:17.417 --> 31:20.836
I'm gonna get the police. I'm not gonna
muss myself up fussing with you.

31:20.837 --> 31:24.496
- I'll get the police if I have to.
- OK.

31:26.301 --> 31:28.886
- That's exactly what I'm gonna do.
- OK.

31:31.639 --> 31:33.004
Penguin.

31:34.350 --> 31:38.061
Now, my friend, Claude, here,
is in love.

31:38.062 --> 31:39.688
He saw this chick on a horse...

31:39.689 --> 31:41.315
- Excuse me.
- Jesus.

31:41.316 --> 31:44.526
Now, let's deal
with this as gentlemen.

31:44.527 --> 31:47.738
- OK. OK. Good.
- Quietly. As gentlemen.

31:47.739 --> 31:50.532
- Now may I give you a word of advice?
- Yeah.

31:50.533 --> 31:54.778
Get your ass out of here, now.

31:55.538 --> 31:57.039
Is that it?

31:57.040 --> 31:59.291
- That's it, yes.
- Thank you.

31:59.292 --> 32:01.126
Now, listen.

32:01.127 --> 32:02.753
Claude here is in love.

32:02.754 --> 32:06.340
The girl he's in love with
is sitting in this room.

32:06.341 --> 32:11.141
He just wants to sit here
and look at her for five minutes.

32:11.512 --> 32:15.015
He just wants to look at her
and have this picture in his head

32:15.016 --> 32:17.436
when he's off there fighting
in the jungles.

32:20.021 --> 32:24.066
Is that so much to ask?
Hey! This is for you, man.

32:24.067 --> 32:26.526
Wait a minute.
This is what you want.

32:26.527 --> 32:30.238
Sheila, is that OK if Claude
just sits here and looks at you

32:30.239 --> 32:32.776
for a few minutes before we go?

You don't know anybody on the streets.

36:42.366 --> 36:44.318
How you gonna get the bread?

36:47.663 --> 36:51.833
He's not, man. He's just gonna leave us
in here to rot, that's all.

36:51.834 --> 36:56.371
- No, I can make some calls.
- Yeah, call my mama.

37:04.722 --> 37:07.307
You better know what you're doing.

37:07.308 --> 37:09.552
You sure better, George.

37:36.087 --> 37:37.354

37:46.180 --> 37:50.980
Uh, excuse me.
You're in our way.

37:51.852 --> 37:53.511
What?

37:54.522 --> 37:57.524
You're blocking our way.
Would you move, please?

37:57.525 --> 37:59.183
Sure.

38:13.124 --> 38:15.250
- Hi.
- Hi.

38:15.251 --> 38:17.002
Remember me?

38:17.003 --> 38:18.807
Yeah.

38:19.630 --> 38:21.288
Come on in.

38:22.800 --> 38:24.634
We have to get to school.

38:24.635 --> 38:26.803
Great.
Just get in, will you?

38:26.804 --> 38:29.048
What do you want?

38:32.435 --> 38:35.312
What are you doing?
Where are you going?

38:36.397 --> 38:39.149
Jesus H. Christ!
What do you think you're doing?

38:39.150 --> 38:43.950
You can't drive this car! We're only
covered for Dad and me, OK? Sheila...

38:44.739 --> 38:47.490
Listen, man, I got a little problem.
I need some bread right away.

38:47.491 --> 38:50.160
It's $250.
I need it now.

38:50.161 --> 38:53.413
- This is all about money?
- Yeah. You got any?

38:53.414 --> 38:55.123
No.

38:55.124 --> 38:58.209
Look, we really don't have any time now.

38:58.210 --> 39:02.088
We've got to be at school.
So will you just stop the car? OK?

39:02.089 --> 39:03.942
Just let me drive.

39:05.009 --> 39:06.968
Sheila!

39:06.969 --> 39:10.774
- What do you want me to do?
- Tell him to stop.

39:11.223 --> 39:12.442
Stop.

39:14.185 --> 39:16.853
Listen, my friends are still in jail.
So what I figured was

39:16.854 --> 39:19.272
you could ask your old man
for the bread to get them out.

39:19.273 --> 39:22.067
- Ask my father for the money?
- Yeah.

39:22.068 --> 39:23.610
Right.

39:23.611 --> 39:27.113
He got us into this.
At least he could get us out of it.

39:27.114 --> 39:29.115
- He got you into this?
- Yeah.

39:29.116 --> 39:31.785
He told you to dance on the table
and break all the dishes?

39:31.786 --> 39:33.203
He didn't tell me to dance on the table.

39:33.204 --> 39:34.954
There's a left here
at the bottom of the hill.

39:34.955 --> 39:37.290
- I think you're really crazy.
- What are you talking about?

39:37.291 --> 39:40.960
The man got the kids in jail.
We want the money to get them out.

39:40.961 --> 39:42.462
- Coming up is a left.
- It's impossible.

39:42.463 --> 39:44.964
- Why is it impossible?
- He won't even give me a credit card.

39:44.965 --> 39:46.966
- With that house you live in?
- It's coming up here!

39:46.967 --> 39:49.803
- Two hundred and fifty dollars.
- Right here!

39:49.804 --> 39:52.180
Turn left! Right here!

39:52.181 --> 39:54.641
Jesus! You missed it!

39:54.642 --> 39:56.476
What did I miss, Steve?

39:56.477 --> 39:59.312
The school. It's back there.

39:59.313 --> 40:04.113
- Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Mmm.

40:19.500 --> 40:24.300
OK. Look, we'll help you, OK?
We'll try to get you some money. OK?

40:24.338 --> 40:28.437
So you can stop the car now,
and I'll drive. OK?

40:28.968 --> 40:33.054
- When?
- I don't know. Right after school.

40:33.055 --> 40:37.855
OK, how's that? About 4:00, OK?
We'll have it for you at 4:00.

40:39.145 --> 40:42.022
See, that's my other problem, man.

40:42.398 --> 40:45.108
- What?
- You're full of shit.

40:50.865 --> 40:55.255
You won't ask your old man for
the bread, and Junior is full of shit.

40:55.911 --> 40:58.204

41:16.307 --> 41:19.087
No, no, no, no...

41:27.401 --> 41:30.487

- Men? What do you mean?

41:30.488 --> 41:33.170
Do you have any sexual attraction
towards men?

41:36.744 --> 41:40.079
- Am I a homosexual or something?
- Yeah.

41:40.080 --> 41:43.249

out of my bed,

41:43.250 --> 41:47.128

- You're going away tomorrow, right?
- Yeah.

01:00:38.551 --> 01:00:41.595
So, what's the point?

01:00:41.596 --> 01:00:45.057
You mean, if I wasn't going away,
it would be different?

01:00:45.058 --> 01:00:46.764
Maybe.

01:00:47.185 --> 01:00:48.501
Well...

01:00:49.729 --> 01:00:52.731
- I might not go.
- Right.

01:00:52.732 --> 01:00:54.983
- You expect me to believe that?
- I'm serious.

01:00:54.984 --> 01:00:57.276
Forget it.
I don't believe you.

01:01:02.784 --> 01:01:07.204

I'm really sorry.

01:02:54.395 --> 01:02:57.022
I didn't think she'd ever
pull a stunt like that.

01:02:57.023 --> 01:03:00.984
We know where she lives. We'll give
her clothes back tomorrow. It's cool.

01:03:00.985 --> 01:03:02.643

What do you want?

01:03:13.372 --> 01:03:16.541
You want to be a hero with a gun,
a big macho dude in a uniform?

01:03:16.542 --> 01:03:20.545
- Is that what you want?
- I can't talk to you.

01:03:20.546 --> 01:03:22.672
I'm standing right here.
Talk to me.

01:03:22.673 --> 01:03:24.722

Look, don't hand me that.
If you're doing it for me, don't.
