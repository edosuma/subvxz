00:07.240 --> 00:10.280
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

00:10.360 --> 00:14.520
<i>Marina and Lorayne were selected</i>
<i>as the most popular players.</i>

00:15.120 --> 00:17.920
The person we've decided to block is...

00:18.640 --> 00:19.480
Ellipsis.

00:20.120 --> 00:22.360
<i>Who is leaving </i>The Circle<i> this time?</i>

00:24.360 --> 00:25.560
Julia?

00:25.640 --> 00:27.000
What?

00:27.080 --> 00:29.840
I'm pissed. I'm really pissed.

00:30.640 --> 00:32.240
<i>And now,</i>

00:32.320 --> 00:34.720
<i>Julia is entering one of the apartments</i>

00:36.040 --> 00:38.040
<i>to settle a score.</i>

00:40.600 --> 00:42.920
It's so intense. I'm gonna light a candle.

01:02.000 --> 01:03.520
No way!

01:04.440 --> 01:05.840
How's it going, girl?

01:05.920 --> 01:07.240
Holy fuck!

01:07.320 --> 01:08.720
No way!

01:13.240 --> 01:16.160
Why were you hiding under the table?

01:16.240 --> 01:18.680
Because you like knives. I was scared.

01:18.760 --> 01:19.920
Holy Jesus!

01:20.000 --> 01:22.520
I can't believe it!

01:24.800 --> 01:27.880
Dude, I hated you since the beginning.

01:28.480 --> 01:30.240
You have no idea.

01:30.320 --> 01:32.960
-Why?
-My crown even fell off.

01:33.040 --> 01:34.720
-Let's sit.
-Make yourself at home.

01:34.800 --> 01:36.800
-Do you want water?
-No, thanks.

01:36.880 --> 01:40.840
It's too bad you misinterpreted me, man.

01:40.920 --> 01:42.600
Because, in fact, I'm like this.

01:42.680 --> 01:45.640
Julia is my daughter's name.
But at the same time,

01:45.760 --> 01:49.640
I ended up posing as my friend Lua

01:49.720 --> 01:51.920
because I want Julia to be like her.

01:52.080 --> 01:55.840
She's a strong womanÂ who's not afraid
of what people think about her.

01:55.920 --> 01:59.040
I am Julia. The only difference
is that I'm not photogenic.

01:59.120 --> 02:02.640
-It would've been better to be yourself!
-Yeah.

02:02.720 --> 02:05.280
You're so stylish.

02:05.360 --> 02:07.080
-It makes no sense.
-I was Julia.

02:07.160 --> 02:09.560
-That was the idea.
-Look at Gaybol.

02:11.480 --> 02:13.040
Yeah, well...

02:13.520 --> 02:15.240
Julia is not coming.

02:15.320 --> 02:17.800
It looks like she's not coming.

02:19.120 --> 02:21.800
Yeah, I'm gonna eat both plates.

02:21.880 --> 02:24.120
Dude, what a pity.

02:24.200 --> 02:25.960
It's so sad.

02:27.680 --> 02:30.080
What about Lucas?
Don't you think he's a catfish?

02:30.160 --> 02:31.440
I don't... Shit...

02:32.520 --> 02:34.400
It's too complicated.

02:36.200 --> 02:38.200
Are you sure Lucas is a catfish?

02:38.280 --> 02:40.520
-Going through that line of thought...
-No.

02:40.600 --> 02:42.960
-We're never sure of anything.
-I know.

02:43.040 --> 02:46.000
But I think JP is a catfish.
Look at that photo.

02:46.080 --> 02:48.520
-It's so fake.
-Yeah, I also suspect him.

02:48.600 --> 02:51.440
He's too perfect.
When this all started, my dream was

02:51.520 --> 02:54.360
to have you, me, Duma, and Lorayne

02:54.440 --> 02:55.760
partying together.

02:55.840 --> 02:57.120
-Everybody twerking.
-Listen.

02:57.200 --> 02:59.280
-What?
-Can you believe I've tried to twerk?

02:59.360 --> 03:02.000
-Let's give it a try.
-Raise your butt like this.

03:02.080 --> 03:05.280
Oh, I have to raise it.
Your butt is enormous!

03:06.120 --> 03:08.040
Holy shit! Dude!

03:08.120 --> 03:09.720
-Let's do it.
-Go!

03:09.800 --> 03:12.640
Raise your butt.
To the left, to the right.

03:12.720 --> 03:14.560
I'm a pro already.

03:14.640 --> 03:15.800
Give Auntie a hug.

03:17.120 --> 03:18.080
Good luck.

03:18.160 --> 03:20.640
-It was great meeting you. You're awesome.
-Thank you.

03:21.320 --> 03:22.440
Thank you, <i>The Circle!</i>

03:23.080 --> 03:24.720
Oh, my God.

03:24.800 --> 03:27.120
It's really hard

03:27.200 --> 03:29.160
to express yourself through messages.

03:29.240 --> 03:32.440
That's why people keep fighting
in social media.

03:32.520 --> 03:35.160
I got it right, girl!

03:35.520 --> 03:37.840
Marina ended up seeing Julia

03:37.920 --> 03:40.040
in a negative light,

03:40.120 --> 03:41.200
now we're blocked.

03:41.280 --> 03:44.800
#EyesOnThePrizeGirl!

03:48.840 --> 03:50.520
All that's left for me...

03:50.600 --> 03:53.160
is to get some sleep
because tomorrow is a new day.

03:53.240 --> 03:56.520
Today was intense.
I have to go up in the ranking.

03:56.600 --> 03:59.440
The game is getting harder.

03:59.520 --> 04:01.320
Better days are coming.

04:01.600 --> 04:02.920
Let's do this!

04:03.000 --> 04:04.520
Good night, Circle.

04:06.800 --> 04:08.920
The masks have fallen.

04:12.960 --> 04:15.280
Good night, Circle!

04:15.920 --> 04:19.440
<i>Masks are falling,</i>
<i>and crazy stuff is happening.</i>

04:19.520 --> 04:23.360
<i>Nothing better than a good night's sleep</i>
<i>to face a new day.</i>

04:36.160 --> 04:38.600
Good morning, Circle!

04:39.480 --> 04:40.320
Cel!

04:40.400 --> 04:41.240
What?

04:41.320 --> 04:42.400
Wake up.

04:42.480 --> 04:45.040
Another day has come.

04:45.120 --> 04:48.240
Fortunately for some,
unfortunately for others.

04:50.640 --> 04:52.680
Her soul is still here.

04:53.120 --> 04:55.480
Too bad for her,
but at least it wasn't me.

04:55.560 --> 04:57.920
She's gone. She didn't come here.

04:58.000 --> 05:01.400
I was all excited, saying,
"Come over, Auntie!"

05:01.480 --> 05:05.160
I'm really curious to know
if Auntie is really Auntie

05:05.240 --> 05:07.640
or if Auntie is an uncle.

05:08.280 --> 05:12.200
<i>The only truth in social media</i>
<i>is what we post, right?</i>

05:14.200 --> 05:16.360
"Update your status."

05:16.440 --> 05:18.000
Nice!

05:18.080 --> 05:19.400
I was waiting for this.

05:19.960 --> 05:21.480
I'm thinking about what to say.

05:21.560 --> 05:23.520
I was in last place.
I want to win them over now.

05:23.600 --> 05:25.560
Circle, message.

05:25.640 --> 05:29.800
I admit I am dying to know...

05:29.880 --> 05:32.440
"...if Julia is Auntie or Uncle."

05:36.480 --> 05:38.440
You will see, Duma.

05:38.520 --> 05:40.600
Whoa, I haven't thought about it.

05:40.680 --> 05:43.880
I think she is what she said she was.

05:43.960 --> 05:45.400
I'm giving myself a like.

05:45.480 --> 05:46.920
Because I...

05:47.000 --> 05:49.640
love myself.

05:49.720 --> 05:51.960
This is so lame.

05:52.040 --> 05:56.000
You want people thinking
you have more likes than them?

05:56.080 --> 05:59.800
Everybody can check the list
and see you gave yourself a like.

05:59.880 --> 06:04.440
If you don't love yourself,
who is going to love you?

06:04.520 --> 06:06.240
Circle, message.

06:06.840 --> 06:09.800
There comes a time when masks fall off,

06:09.880 --> 06:12.600
but you only live once.

06:12.680 --> 06:15.760
#WakeUpPeople.

06:15.840 --> 06:16.720
Send.

06:18.240 --> 06:20.920
Masks falling off? Holy shit.

06:21.000 --> 06:23.080
Is this is a spoiler?

06:23.160 --> 06:25.400
"#WakeUpPeople"?

06:25.480 --> 06:28.560
Marina, what else do you have to say?

06:28.640 --> 06:30.160
Oh, my God.

06:30.240 --> 06:32.920
It looks like she met Ju

06:33.000 --> 06:35.960
and found out she was a catfish,
or something like that.

06:36.520 --> 06:37.960
Circle, message.

06:38.040 --> 06:41.280
What a day, you guys, comma,

06:41.360 --> 06:43.640
I'm so grateful. Oh, my God!

06:43.720 --> 06:45.520
#IDontLieICried

06:45.600 --> 06:48.160
Circle, update my status.

06:49.080 --> 06:51.240
She's so cute!

06:51.320 --> 06:53.640
Does she really just tell the truth?

06:53.720 --> 06:56.240
But since you're an influencer,

06:56.320 --> 06:59.400
you deserve a like.

06:59.480 --> 07:01.760
Good job. Let's go.

07:01.840 --> 07:03.600
Circle, update my status.

07:03.680 --> 07:05.920
Good morning, #CircleClan.

07:06.000 --> 07:07.520
Sun emoji.

07:08.080 --> 07:11.480
Is everything okay, comma,
are we all hydrated?

07:12.040 --> 07:14.360
Because everybody hydrates. They will say,

07:14.440 --> 07:17.280
"Of course I'm hydrated. Give him a like."

07:17.360 --> 07:19.200
Circle, post my status.

07:19.960 --> 07:22.720
Let's see those likes. It's gonna happen.

07:22.800 --> 07:25.280
Duh! "Are we all hydrated?"

07:27.160 --> 07:30.040
I don't like this dude.
I'm not gonna give him a like.

07:30.120 --> 07:33.160
Gaybol is not popular. He can't do it.

07:33.920 --> 07:35.720
He can't do it, the poor guy.

07:35.800 --> 07:37.720
Wow, what a tough crowd.

07:37.800 --> 07:41.120
It's so hard to win them over,
for God's sake.

07:42.280 --> 07:43.640
They hate me.

07:44.200 --> 07:46.520
Circle, give Gaybol a like.

07:47.080 --> 07:50.640
That's a good strategy.
I'm showing him I'm here for him.

07:50.720 --> 07:52.680
My first like. Circle, open the list.

07:53.480 --> 07:55.440
It's Akel. A hydrated dude.

07:56.040 --> 07:59.640
Fuck. Thank you, Akel. At least one.

07:59.720 --> 08:02.080
-Circle, give Gaybol a like.
-Give Gaybol a like.

08:03.960 --> 08:08.160
Wow, everybody is trying to play nice.

08:08.240 --> 08:10.040
Nice. Five likes.

08:10.120 --> 08:13.120
Dumaresq never gives me a like.

08:13.200 --> 08:15.600
I thought I would relate to him, but...

08:15.680 --> 08:18.320
Maybe he suspects me for some reason.

08:18.400 --> 08:19.240
He and JP.

08:19.320 --> 08:20.680
I'm gonna do the same.

08:20.760 --> 08:24.160
Circle, give Gaybol a like.

08:24.240 --> 08:27.560
It's pure politics.

08:27.640 --> 08:29.920
Dumaresq! I was just talking about him!

08:30.000 --> 08:32.080
Wow, Dumaresq. Speak of the devil.

08:32.160 --> 08:33.560
Gaybol has seven likes?

08:34.200 --> 08:36.200
Is there a technical problem?

08:36.760 --> 08:38.560
Dumaresq gave him a like.

08:38.640 --> 08:40.520
Duma, what's your problem?

08:41.040 --> 08:43.880
I thought we were turning into a duo.

08:43.960 --> 08:47.520
And you give him a like now?

08:48.200 --> 08:49.920
I'm completely lost.

08:50.000 --> 08:53.480
I don't wanna be alone in this
and be the annoying one

08:53.880 --> 08:56.120
who didn't like his comment.

08:56.360 --> 08:58.720
Give him a like. Game strategy.

08:59.200 --> 09:00.800
I won't shoot myself in the foot.

09:01.520 --> 09:04.240
One more like, coming straight from JP.

09:04.320 --> 09:07.840
Nice, dude. Now we're talking.
Thank you, JP.

09:08.240 --> 09:11.440
It's done. Everybody gave me a like.

09:11.520 --> 09:13.720
I feel like I've accomplished a mission.

09:13.800 --> 09:16.600
Interesting. Everybody's playing nice.

09:16.680 --> 09:20.840
Giving each other a like.
No one puts their ass on the line.

09:20.920 --> 09:23.520
A like means lots of things.

09:23.600 --> 09:25.040
<i>A bunch of likes!</i>

09:25.120 --> 09:27.320
<i>Everybody wants to leave</i>
<i>a good impression.</i>

09:29.320 --> 09:30.960
<i>JP now lives at the gym,</i>

09:31.040 --> 09:33.840
<i>and Lorayne lives in Akel's heart.</i>

09:35.680 --> 09:36.960
I woke up feeling good.

09:37.040 --> 09:40.480
I'm excited.
My idea was to try and talk to Lolo.

09:40.560 --> 09:44.120
It's nice chatting with her.
This strengthens our bond.

09:44.200 --> 09:46.880
Circle, open a chat with Lorayne.

09:48.440 --> 09:50.600
"Akel has invited you to a private chat."

09:50.680 --> 09:52.680
Are we having a relationship,

09:52.760 --> 09:55.120
or do you just want to kiss my ass

09:55.480 --> 09:59.080
because I'm in first place?

09:59.160 --> 10:02.400
Circle, open the chat with Akel.

10:03.760 --> 10:05.360
Here comes the ladies' man.

10:05.440 --> 10:06.280
He's here.

10:06.360 --> 10:07.840
Circle, message.

10:08.200 --> 10:11.040
Do you miss me already?

10:11.120 --> 10:15.240
"Your profile picture looks great
with that influencer badge on it."

10:15.760 --> 10:19.040
Yeah, he wants to kiss my ass.

10:19.120 --> 10:20.640
Circle, message.

10:20.720 --> 10:22.680
It was super hard to choose.

10:22.760 --> 10:24.760
Emoji that looks like this.

10:24.840 --> 10:28.720
I needed my boo to hold my hand.
LMAO. Send.

10:31.160 --> 10:33.640
"I needed my boo to hold my hand. LMAO."

10:33.720 --> 10:35.640
Circle, message.

10:36.240 --> 10:38.640
I want to keep treating everybody well.

10:38.720 --> 10:41.040
I believe I can make real friends here.

10:41.120 --> 10:42.680
Circle, send.

10:43.120 --> 10:45.840
"I believe I can make real friends here."

10:45.920 --> 10:48.200
I think exactly the same.

10:48.760 --> 10:50.040
Circle, message.

10:50.120 --> 10:53.040
The feeling is mutual. #Reciprocity.

10:53.400 --> 10:54.680
Heart emoji.

10:54.760 --> 10:56.400
Thank you for everything.

10:56.480 --> 10:58.120
Heart eyes emoji.

10:58.800 --> 10:59.640
Send.

11:00.920 --> 11:02.720
"Thank you for everything."

11:04.680 --> 11:07.480
She's messing with my heart.

11:07.560 --> 11:08.840
Circle, message.

11:09.400 --> 11:11.640
It's great to have you around.

11:11.720 --> 11:14.240
Put that emoji with heart-shaped eyes.

11:14.320 --> 11:15.720
Circle, send.

11:17.360 --> 11:18.280
"Akel.

11:18.360 --> 11:21.200
It's great to have you around."

11:21.280 --> 11:24.160
The dude is great at answering messages.

11:24.240 --> 11:26.720
Wow, this duo is going strong.

11:26.800 --> 11:28.880
What the hell?

11:28.960 --> 11:30.200
I have reached my peak.

11:30.280 --> 11:32.960
<i>I don't have any emojis</i>
<i>to respond to that.</i>

11:34.160 --> 11:36.920
If you're not being honest at all,

11:37.000 --> 11:39.120
then you've managed to trick me.

11:39.320 --> 11:41.680
This type ofÂ character thing,

11:41.760 --> 11:44.200
isn't something that lasts.

11:44.280 --> 11:48.120
You can actually smell
the rotting stench that liars have.

11:50.160 --> 11:51.440
Kissing machine gun.

11:53.400 --> 11:55.720
I even knocked down the vase, whoa!

11:56.640 --> 11:58.360
<i>Is that a power couple?</i>

12:13.040 --> 12:15.400
Whoa. "The newsfeed has been updated."

12:15.480 --> 12:17.640
Circle, open my newsfeed.

12:18.320 --> 12:19.400
"Newsfeed.

12:19.480 --> 12:22.880
Before leaving, Julia left a message!"

12:25.440 --> 12:30.080
So it's the moment of truth!

12:30.160 --> 12:31.280
Circle, open the video.

12:31.360 --> 12:33.200
Let's see.

12:34.280 --> 12:38.440
It's time. Catfish...

12:38.520 --> 12:41.320
I'm pretty sure she is
what she said she was.

12:50.280 --> 12:51.680
Holy shit!

12:53.680 --> 12:56.600
-I knew it!
<i>-Julia who?</i>

12:56.680 --> 12:58.600
Uncle!

12:58.680 --> 13:00.320
It's Rob speaking.

13:00.400 --> 13:02.480
I knew it! She was a catfish!

13:02.560 --> 13:06.360
Did you know that things aren't always
what they seem to be?

13:07.080 --> 13:08.920
It's an uncle!

13:09.000 --> 13:12.360
I could smell she was an uncle
from far away!

13:12.440 --> 13:14.160
From far away!

13:14.240 --> 13:18.920
Careful. I think there are other people
like me in the game.

13:19.000 --> 13:21.920
Did you have to say
there are other people like you?

13:22.000 --> 13:24.480
Everybody will get confused now.

13:24.560 --> 13:26.160
<i>Don't spoil it!</i>

13:27.480 --> 13:30.640
Pretending to be a girl
is not an easy task.

13:30.720 --> 13:32.960
I want to know what JP thinks about it.

13:33.040 --> 13:34.920
He was all over Julia.

13:35.000 --> 13:38.240
Holy shit, dude!

13:41.560 --> 13:43.080
There's something

13:43.440 --> 13:46.520
really important that I want to say.
Pay attention.

13:46.720 --> 13:48.760
You guys are ranking people

13:48.840 --> 13:50.520
<i>with your hearts.</i>

13:50.600 --> 13:52.480
<i>Don't forget this is a game.</i>

13:52.560 --> 13:55.160
You might face the consequences
at the end, like I did.

13:55.240 --> 13:57.880
Was that message for me?

13:57.960 --> 14:00.320
Because of Lucas? Dude!

14:02.520 --> 14:04.520
#CallYourAuntie.

14:06.560 --> 14:08.080
I don't want to!

14:08.160 --> 14:10.920
Look at that beast saying,
"Call your Auntie!"

14:11.000 --> 14:14.680
That was so predictable, honey.

14:14.760 --> 14:18.960
I feel very deceived.
I'm scared of everybody now!

14:19.040 --> 14:21.240
I even flirted with her.

14:21.320 --> 14:23.080
Can you believe that?

14:23.160 --> 14:24.800
I was completely fooled.

14:25.520 --> 14:28.440
Even if he's Julio, Julia, Rony...

14:29.160 --> 14:31.920
Dude, we would've been great friends.

14:32.000 --> 14:33.960
If there's another catfish

14:34.040 --> 14:36.320
playing with my feelings...

14:37.240 --> 14:38.280
watch your back.

14:38.360 --> 14:40.000
<i>Yikes, I don't want to see that.</i>

14:47.120 --> 14:49.680
Girl...

14:52.240 --> 14:54.920
I can't wait to chat with the girls.

14:55.000 --> 14:57.440
What is on their minds?

14:58.840 --> 15:02.760
Circle, open the She Fights Chat.

15:04.040 --> 15:06.240
"Marina has invited you to the...

15:06.320 --> 15:08.200
-She Fights Chat."
-"She Fights."

15:08.280 --> 15:10.920
The group chat Dumaresq created.

15:11.480 --> 15:14.920
The She Fights Chat is on fire!

15:15.000 --> 15:18.040
Circle, open the She Fights Chat.

15:22.280 --> 15:24.680
First of all, comma,

good morning.

15:25.840 --> 15:30.440
What the hell was that, girls?

15:30.520 --> 15:33.200
Shocked emoji,
the one who looks like this.

15:50.480 --> 15:53.400
Dude... Circle, message.

15:53.480 --> 15:58.720

16:00.120 --> 16:04.160
"But we actually discussed theories

16:04.240 --> 16:06.200
about some potential catfish.

16:06.280 --> 16:08.200
Do we have another one?"

16:08.280 --> 16:10.480
Of course we have, girl! Of course!

16:10.560 --> 16:12.120
Circle, message.

16:12.200 --> 16:13.880
I might be new in the game,

16:14.360 --> 16:16.840
but at first glance,
I felt there was something weird.

16:16.920 --> 16:18.560
Scared face emoji.

16:19.240 --> 16:22.680
Marina and Lorayne did a great job.

16:23.440 --> 16:25.160
Let's find the next catfish.

16:25.240 --> 16:26.120
Send.

16:29.960 --> 16:30.920
Whoa.

It's JP.

Circle, message.

16:36.320 --> 16:37.640
This morning,

16:37.720 --> 16:41.400
I actually realized

16:41.480 --> 16:43.920
I barely know

16:44.240 --> 16:46.920
anything about Lucas's life.

16:47.000 --> 16:47.920
Period.

16:48.000 --> 16:51.320
#CouldThatBe? Question mark.

16:51.800 --> 16:52.680
Send.

16:54.520 --> 16:57.200
Oh, my God.

16:57.280 --> 17:01.120
Dude, I would hate if he wasÂ a catfish.

17:01.200 --> 17:02.880
Please, God...

17:03.880 --> 17:05.960
He's not a catfish.

17:06.960 --> 17:08.880
I've just touched a sore spot.

17:09.440 --> 17:12.320
In theory...

17:13.200 --> 17:16.600
Marina is into Lucas, right?

17:16.680 --> 17:18.120
Circle, message.

17:18.920 --> 17:21.400
I was thinking about that, too, Dumaresq,

17:21.480 --> 17:22.560
comma,

17:23.000 --> 17:25.920
Lucas and Gaybol, both seem kinda off.

17:26.760 --> 17:29.720

-Send.

17:31.760 --> 17:35.480
Yes, girl. You mentioned exactly

17:35.560 --> 17:38.400
the two people

17:38.640 --> 17:40.160
I suspect the most.

17:40.240 --> 17:41.640
Circle, message.

17:42.120 --> 17:45.640
My guess is JP. His messages are weird.

17:45.720 --> 17:49.120
I don't think Gaybol is a catfish!
Exclamation mark.

17:49.200 --> 17:52.400
He lacks personality. Send.

17:53.160 --> 17:55.920
Lorayne and Marina are strongheaded.

17:57.040 --> 17:59.440
Are they influencers? Yes, they are.

17:59.520 --> 18:01.200
But calm down, girls.

18:01.280 --> 18:05.040
I don't want to give JP
a low ranking right now.

18:05.600 --> 18:07.840
Would I give Lucas a low ranking? Yes.

18:07.920 --> 18:10.760
For sure.

18:11.880 --> 18:13.480
Circle, message.

18:14.040 --> 18:17.120
Let's solve these mysteries.

18:17.760 --> 18:19.560
I hope Lucas...

18:19.640 --> 18:22.400
"...isn't playing with my heart.

18:22.480 --> 18:24.960
#IGotYou. #TogetherWeAreStronger."

18:25.040 --> 18:28.280
He has to loosen up
because Dumaresq is onto him.

18:28.360 --> 18:31.600
Duma is onto him. I was onto him, too.

18:31.680 --> 18:34.160
Yeah. At this stage of the game,

18:34.480 --> 18:39.480
he still needs people
telling him to loosen up?

18:40.000 --> 18:42.880
I think everybody wants to find
the next catfish.

18:44.280 --> 18:46.360
And Luma's ass is not on the line.

18:46.440 --> 18:49.320
Luma is one of the girls.

18:49.880 --> 18:52.160
Luma's next hashtag, write this down.

18:52.800 --> 18:54.800
#FuckingTheEntireHouse.

18:56.360 --> 18:58.760
If I'm not an influencer again,

18:59.720 --> 19:02.360
I'm sure Lucas will leave.

19:02.760 --> 19:04.280
He will be blocked.

19:05.440 --> 19:08.200
Maybe if I talk to Lucas...

19:09.960 --> 19:11.920
he'll pay more attention to this.

19:13.880 --> 19:16.800
And maybe I'll get to know more about him.

19:16.880 --> 19:18.680
<i>Let's see if it works out, Marina.</i>

19:18.760 --> 19:22.440
<i>Your crush needs to wake up</i>
<i>and show everybody who he is.</i>

19:24.080 --> 19:27.240
Circle, open a chat with Lucas.

19:27.840 --> 19:28.920
Whoa.

19:29.000 --> 19:31.800
"Marina has invited you
to a private chat."

Oh, no! My time has come.

Hey, beautiful.

I got worried about you.

20:38.600 --> 20:40.760

Are we starting to protect

20:44.160 --> 20:45.800
people

20:45.880 --> 20:48.240
in the game?

20:48.320 --> 20:50.320
I can't believe it.

20:50.400 --> 20:52.400
I'm not being a tattletale.

20:53.400 --> 20:54.360
Actually, I am.

20:54.440 --> 20:56.920
But he's my crush.
I want him to trust me. Got it?

20:57.480 --> 20:59.920
But if you're playing games
with my heart,

21:00.200 --> 21:02.000

between us.

21:39.080 --> 21:41.600
I don't trust relationships.

He may be playing with my heart,

22:44.600 --> 22:46.600
I relate a lot to Dumaresq,

but he didn't give me a chance
to show that we're similar.

22:50.520 --> 22:53.200
JP and I are opposites,

23:04.840 --> 23:06.720
I bet it's some strategy.

You're not my main focus anymore, okay?

"But I wanted to talk to you."

24:04.600 --> 24:06.600
Great. That's nice to read.

24:06.680 --> 24:08.360
Okay. Got it, Dumaresq.

24:08.440 --> 24:10.320
It makes sense now.

24:10.400 --> 24:11.720
Circle, message.

24:12.000 --> 24:13.160
I agree with Dumaresq.

24:13.720 --> 24:14.560
Gaybol,

24:14.640 --> 24:17.240
aren't you trying too hard
to please people?

24:17.640 --> 24:19.000
Does anybody agree?

24:20.200 --> 24:24.280
Yes! He's trying too hard
to please people!

24:24.360 --> 24:26.920
"Aren't you trying too hard
to please people?"

24:29.880 --> 24:31.640
Circle, message.

24:31.720 --> 24:34.760
You have to be straightforward

24:34.840 --> 24:38.560
and show some personality.

24:38.640 --> 24:41.360
To be on the fence,

24:41.440 --> 24:44.440
to be neither hot nor cold,

24:44.520 --> 24:46.160
it doesn't work well for you.

24:46.240 --> 24:49.040
"And that was my next topic, Gaybol.

24:49.120 --> 24:50.960
#ChanceGiven."

24:51.040 --> 24:52.720
Nice. It's great feedback.

24:52.800 --> 24:54.240
Circle, message.

24:54.880 --> 24:58.040
Wow, just by talking to you guys,

24:58.120 --> 25:02.960
I already know how to express myself
and how I should be in <i>#TheCircle.</i>

25:03.040 --> 25:04.200
Send message.

25:07.880 --> 25:10.160
Well, buddy, you didn't get it.

25:10.240 --> 25:12.120
That wasn't written for you.

25:12.200 --> 25:14.200

25:14.680 --> 25:17.560

25:22.960 --> 25:25.400

25:26.840 --> 25:29.680
Gaybol scored a point!

25:29.760 --> 25:31.440
Circle, message. That's it, then.

25:31.520 --> 25:33.960
Be yourself, loosen up.

25:34.040 --> 25:36.600
Thanks for inviting me. Send.

25:37.440 --> 25:40.800
Thank you, guys.
I learned a lot from this conversation.

25:40.880 --> 25:42.320
Wow. That's awesome.

25:42.400 --> 25:45.320
Dumaresq, my man,
we're in this together.

25:45.400 --> 25:47.520
I'm calm now. My heart is at peace.

25:48.560 --> 25:51.920
Gaybol, your ass isn't on the line now.

25:52.000 --> 25:54.520
I'm focused on Lucas.

25:55.400 --> 25:58.680
<i>To be a catfish or not to be,</i>
<i>that is the question.</i>

26:05.600 --> 26:07.040
OPINION POLL

26:07.120 --> 26:09.320
-Wow!
-Whoa!

26:09.400 --> 26:11.200
Whoa, a game!

26:11.640 --> 26:12.840
Holy shit!

26:13.920 --> 26:18.320
What is that? A game? Oh, wow.

26:18.400 --> 26:20.560
<i>Opinion poll coming through.</i>

26:20.640 --> 26:22.800
<i>What do they think about each other?</i>

26:22.880 --> 26:24.760
Circle, what are you trying to do?

26:24.840 --> 26:27.840
A game to makes us fight with one another?

26:27.920 --> 26:30.760
The Circle <i>will give them five categories.</i>

26:30.840 --> 26:32.160
What's that?

26:32.240 --> 26:36.080
<i>And they will pick the players</i>
<i>that match each one of them.</i>

26:36.640 --> 26:38.840
Holy mother of God.

26:38.920 --> 26:41.400
Marina is screwed.
She likes to be in the spotlight.

26:42.720 --> 26:45.600
"Who is the sexiest person?"

26:47.120 --> 26:50.240
<i>Dumaresq, you can't pick yourself.</i>

26:50.320 --> 26:51.840
JP, for sure!

26:51.920 --> 26:54.680
His arms are three times bigger
than mine. I'm skinny.

26:54.760 --> 26:56.280
I think it's Lolo.

26:56.360 --> 26:59.440
My heart burns when I see her.

26:59.520 --> 27:02.800
The sexiest, in my opinion, is Akel.

27:02.880 --> 27:05.320
I'm not kissing your ass, okay?

27:05.400 --> 27:07.680
Don't get full of yourself, or I...

27:08.360 --> 27:09.200
That's it.

27:09.280 --> 27:11.760
Luma thinks JP is the sexiest.

27:11.840 --> 27:14.920
He's not showing anything
in the photo, you know?

27:15.000 --> 27:17.040
It makes her curious.

27:17.120 --> 27:19.120
Circle, Marina.

27:19.800 --> 27:22.360
I don't think Lucas is sexy.

27:22.440 --> 27:23.840
He has seductive eyes,

27:23.920 --> 27:27.240
but he's still not that sexy, you know?

27:27.320 --> 27:30.240
Circle, my answer is Luma.

27:31.440 --> 27:34.200
"Which <i>The Circle</i> player is two-faced?"

27:34.280 --> 27:37.160
Something tells me...
This sweet voice is telling me,

27:37.240 --> 27:40.480
"Dumaresq, don't trust her!"

27:40.560 --> 27:43.920
I'm gonna listen to it now.
My pick goes to Lorayne.

27:44.000 --> 27:46.040
Lorayne is two-faced.

27:46.120 --> 27:48.400
I'm gonna pick Lucas.

27:48.480 --> 27:50.240
He's always on the fence.

27:50.320 --> 27:52.720
I'm suspicious of him because of that.

27:52.800 --> 27:55.040
Luma picks Marina.

27:55.120 --> 27:56.760
She's nice to everybody,

27:56.840 --> 27:59.560
she's not authentic,
she's on the fence until this day.

27:59.640 --> 28:01.520
I'm pretty sure it's Lorayne.

28:01.600 --> 28:04.360
Everybody thinks she's nice,
she's beautiful...

28:04.440 --> 28:05.920
My pick goes to Lorayne.

28:07.240 --> 28:09.920
"Who's the biggest player in <i>The Circle?"</i>

28:10.480 --> 28:12.040
Trick question.

28:12.120 --> 28:14.360
Circle, Dumaresq.

28:14.920 --> 28:16.840
People seem to be afraid of him.

28:16.920 --> 28:19.600
Everybody is always kissing his ass.

28:19.680 --> 28:21.960
I still think it's Marina.

28:22.040 --> 28:25.240
The biggest player in <i>The Circle</i>
is Marina.

28:25.320 --> 28:27.400
Circle, it's Dumaresq.

28:27.480 --> 28:30.800
He knows how to play
using his strong personality.

28:30.880 --> 28:32.360
He influences people.

28:32.440 --> 28:35.800
He plays with "legal weapons," per se.

28:37.080 --> 28:39.000
"Who's the most trustworthy player?"

28:39.080 --> 28:41.880
What? That's hard.
It will be controversial.

28:41.960 --> 28:45.000
Circle, most trustworthy player

28:45.080 --> 28:46.120
is Dumaresq.

28:46.560 --> 28:50.000
He's not. He's hiding something.
No doubt about it.

28:50.560 --> 28:54.280
I think Luma and I
share the same line of thought,

28:54.360 --> 28:58.480
so my pick goes to Luma.

28:58.560 --> 29:00.600
Circle, my pick goes to Lorayne.

29:00.680 --> 29:03.080
She's authentic, honest, truthful.

29:05.040 --> 29:07.600
"Who's most likely to be a catfish?"

29:07.680 --> 29:10.520
<i>They have the answer</i>
<i>on the tip of their tongue.</i>

29:10.600 --> 29:12.080
<i>That's all they talk about.</i>

29:12.160 --> 29:13.840
Heads will roll!

29:13.920 --> 29:15.640
That's the one.

29:15.720 --> 29:17.280
I'm pretty sure

29:17.360 --> 29:20.200
the person most likely
to be a catfish in <i>The Circle</i>

29:20.280 --> 29:21.280
is Lorayne.

29:22.080 --> 29:24.760
I think the person most likely
to be a catfish is Lucas.

29:24.840 --> 29:27.160
Marina won't pick Lucas.

29:27.240 --> 29:29.240
She's picking JP, I think.

29:29.320 --> 29:30.480
This is easy.

29:30.560 --> 29:34.520
JP. He's too hot, too nice to be true.

29:35.000 --> 29:36.440
THE POLL RESULTS ARE READY
TO BE ANNOUNCED

29:37.360 --> 29:38.920
Here it comes!

29:39.000 --> 29:41.760

everybody's true colors!

29:49.960 --> 29:52.960
Please, be me. Look at this bod.

29:53.040 --> 29:54.560

29:54.640 --> 29:55.480

29:55.560 --> 29:57.320
I'm the sexiest!

29:57.600 --> 30:01.120
Yes! I'm losing my mind right now!

30:01.200 --> 30:02.800
How is Akel sexy?

30:02.880 --> 30:04.760
I didn't think they would pick me, butâ¦

30:04.840 --> 30:06.640
What? Me?

30:09.040 --> 30:11.880
There's a top three? What the hell?

30:11.960 --> 30:13.080
I want all of them.

30:13.160 --> 30:14.800
Circle, message.

30:14.880 --> 30:16.960
JP, the sexy firefighter.

30:17.040 --> 30:19.480
Akel, too obvious.

30:19.560 --> 30:20.480
Send.

30:20.760 --> 30:24.200
Lolo is hitting on me so hard.

30:25.560 --> 30:28.200

30:28.280 --> 30:30.160
Wow, this is heavy shit.

30:30.240 --> 30:31.320
Oh, God...

30:32.960 --> 30:33.960
TWO-FACED

30:34.040 --> 30:36.840
Wow!

30:36.920 --> 30:38.320
Me?

30:42.160 --> 30:44.200
I'm gonna wait and see
what everybody says.

30:44.280 --> 30:46.040
I'm not gonna comment.

30:46.600 --> 30:47.880
Everybody's hiding.

30:52.520 --> 30:53.840
What the hell?

30:55.880 --> 30:58.480
All right. Whatever.

30:58.560 --> 30:59.920
Circle, message.

31:00.400 --> 31:02.240
I don't understand

31:02.320 --> 31:07.600
why people picked Lorayne as two-faced

31:07.680 --> 31:11.680
when she was the best rated player.

31:11.760 --> 31:13.720
"#BrazilDoesntKnowHowToVote."

31:15.080 --> 31:15.920
Good one!

31:16.000 --> 31:19.280
An ass-kisser can also take you down.

31:19.360 --> 31:23.640
So nobody did anything.
Nobody picked me, am I right?

one of those hypocrites!

31:42.080 --> 31:44.760
Just so you know, I don't like you either.

Oh God, these people are so shameless.

31:49.040 --> 31:50.000

31:51.240 --> 31:53.760
That one is gonna be huge.

31:53.840 --> 31:56.920
Marina, for sure. She was the influencer
two times in a row.

31:57.000 --> 31:58.640
She knows how to play, dude.

31:59.840 --> 32:02.280
Nice!

Lorayne's the most trustworthy?

You think? I'm sure of it.

-I won't get involved in this.
-Can't wait for the catfish one.

-Let's see what's he gonna say.
-And Luma scores a point.

33:53.400 --> 33:55.640
Let's be careful with the messages.

33:56.200 --> 33:57.600
Luma would say,

33:57.680 --> 34:01.240
"Yeah, Lucas. Show us who you are."

34:01.320 --> 34:05.040
They're a bunch of hypocrites,

34:05.120 --> 34:06.680
Why didn't you eliminate me?

34:06.760 --> 34:11.200

35:21.640 --> 35:22.480
Send.

35:24.600 --> 35:26.360
That's it. Just so you know,

35:27.360 --> 35:29.560
I don't like you either.

35:30.520 --> 35:31.360
Okay?

35:32.440 --> 35:34.760
"Silence gives consent?"

35:34.840 --> 35:37.920
Whoa, Lorayne. I like it. You were bold.

35:38.000 --> 35:39.880
You were bold.

35:39.960 --> 35:41.880
Circle, message.

35:41.960 --> 35:45.520
Controversial, right?
Look at the other categories.

35:56.720 --> 36:00.760
All right, dude. Wow.
You're really incredible.

36:00.840 --> 36:02.360
Wow.

36:03.200 --> 36:06.520
If you're not an ass-kisser,
can you take people down?

36:06.600 --> 36:10.520
I want to take people down,
but I don't want to be an ass-kisser.

36:10.600 --> 36:13.520
I really like him. I think it's unfair.

36:13.600 --> 36:16.280
The poll results were great, dude.

36:16.360 --> 36:18.840
That game was fun.

36:19.240 --> 36:22.360
The catfish category made me sad.

36:22.440 --> 36:24.720
It's unbelievable.

36:24.800 --> 36:27.880
Gaybol and Luma weren't on the poll.

36:27.960 --> 36:30.040
Luma will stand out more.

36:30.360 --> 36:31.800
-How?
-It's time.

36:38.840 --> 36:40.520
<i>The match is about to start.</i>

36:40.600 --> 36:43.800
<i>Lucas will run to the field,</i>
<i>and he needs to score a goal</i>

36:43.880 --> 36:45.560
<i>to avoid getting a red card.</i>

36:46.800 --> 36:50.440
I think I'm gonna talk to the boys
in the Playmakers Chat,

36:50.520 --> 36:52.520
to get closer to them,

36:52.600 --> 36:54.920
to vent it out to them.

36:55.000 --> 36:57.440
Circle, open the Playmakers Chat.

36:59.840 --> 37:00.680
Whoa!

37:00.760 --> 37:02.800
"Lucas has invited you
to the Playmakers Chat."

37:02.880 --> 37:04.360
The group is back.

37:04.440 --> 37:05.760
The catfish Lucas?

37:07.720 --> 37:08.560

37:10.160 --> 37:11.440
What's up, my dudes?

37:11.520 --> 37:14.480
How's everybody doing
after that little game?

37:14.560 --> 37:16.920
LOL. Sunglasses emoji.

37:17.000 --> 37:18.360
Circle, send.

37:20.040 --> 37:21.880
I'm waiting for an opportunity.

37:21.960 --> 37:23.280
Circle, message.

37:23.360 --> 37:26.840
Hey, Lucas!
I'm glad you brought the group back.

37:26.920 --> 37:29.640
#IMissedYou.

37:30.560 --> 37:32.400
Lucas, all good, dude.

37:32.480 --> 37:35.840
But that whole catfish thing
was a bit weird, comma, huh?

37:36.440 --> 37:40.400
Let's wait. I threw the bait.
It has to look like I'm his friend.

37:40.480 --> 37:42.480
Circle, send message.

37:43.640 --> 37:46.400
Yeah, dude.Â Don't get me started.

37:46.480 --> 37:49.560
I get why people think I'm shy.

37:49.640 --> 37:50.480
Because I am.

37:50.560 --> 37:51.720
But a catfish?

37:51.800 --> 37:54.840
I thought it was funny. Circle, send.

37:55.800 --> 37:57.960
Lucas, I know how you feel.

37:58.040 --> 38:00.040
I've been there on our first day here.

38:00.120 --> 38:02.560
It's unfair to be judged as a catfish.

38:02.640 --> 38:03.640
Send.

38:04.720 --> 38:06.920
Circle, message to Lucas.

38:07.000 --> 38:11.040
Lucas, I think the decisions were based
on people's first impressions.

38:11.120 --> 38:13.680
Lolo is living proof of that.
But don't worry, man.

38:13.760 --> 38:17.520
I think you're getting along
with everybody. #OnTheRightPath.

38:17.600 --> 38:18.960
Circle, send.

38:19.040 --> 38:21.160
Akel felt it.

38:21.240 --> 38:23.600
Because his "crush"

38:24.200 --> 38:27.440
was mercilessly judged as two-faced.

38:27.520 --> 38:28.640
Circle, message.

38:28.720 --> 38:29.920
You guys are right.

38:30.280 --> 38:32.040
I'm loosening up a bit.

38:32.120 --> 38:33.720
"It's great having this group.

38:33.800 --> 38:36.880
We can get to know each other
and get our minds off things."

38:37.840 --> 38:39.360
Circle, message.

38:39.440 --> 38:42.640
It's always great to talk to you all

38:42.720 --> 38:44.680
and bond even more.

38:45.240 --> 38:46.720
Three exclamation marks.

38:46.800 --> 38:49.680
"More" with a bunch of O's.

38:49.760 --> 38:52.000
"The girls are getting along,
and as a consequence,

38:52.080 --> 38:54.880
they became influencers
after the last ratings."

38:54.960 --> 38:56.320
I don't think so.

38:56.400 --> 38:59.120
They won your hearts,
so they were up in the ranking.

38:59.200 --> 39:00.600
Circle, message.

39:00.680 --> 39:02.120
Akel, you said it all.

39:02.200 --> 39:04.840
I've noticed the girls
are a tight bunch now.

39:04.920 --> 39:07.200
Let's strengthen our team as well.

39:07.280 --> 39:10.840
#Unite. Regards. Fist bump emoji.

39:23.440 --> 39:24.520
That's it.

<i>to become influencers,</i>

39:29.720 --> 39:33.560

39:50.240 --> 39:53.000
Oh, my God!

39:54.640 --> 39:56.840
Jesus Christ!

39:58.040 --> 39:59.840

39:59.920 --> 40:01.080
<i>The Circle.</i>

40:02.040 --> 40:03.160
<i>Circle.</i>

40:05.920 --> 40:08.560
My name is Rayssa, I'm 22 years old.

40:10.320 --> 40:13.520
I'm the Drum Queen
from a samba school in Manaus.

40:15.880 --> 40:19.560
I take the queen title very seriously.

40:20.840 --> 40:23.440
Queen Rayssa. She's the best queen.

40:24.240 --> 40:26.120
I love the saying, "God is the best."

40:26.200 --> 40:30.480
When anything happens, I say,
"Wow, God is the best."

40:32.000 --> 40:34.480
I'm a bit famous in Manaus.

40:34.560 --> 40:35.920
My nickname is Ray-slayer.

40:36.000 --> 40:39.960
I'm awesome. I slay.
Some say I'm a big slayer.

40:41.320 --> 40:44.840
I'm narcissistic, I love myself.
There is no profile like mine.

40:46.120 --> 40:48.680
I don't like making other people jealous.

40:48.760 --> 40:53.920
But I think girls get
a little annoyed with me.

40:54.000 --> 40:55.400
Let them fight.

40:56.000 --> 40:59.240
My game strategy is to be myself,

40:59.680 --> 41:01.360
but I'll lie about my age

41:01.440 --> 41:03.600
because when we increase our age,

41:03.680 --> 41:05.640
we get more credibility.

41:06.560 --> 41:09.440
I'm taken. But in the game,

41:09.520 --> 41:11.120
I'm 100% available.

41:11.200 --> 41:14.880
Because it's a great strategy
to get some allies.

41:14.960 --> 41:16.320
Maybe a boyfriend.

41:16.400 --> 41:20.400
He might think he's fooling me,
but I'll be the one who's fooling him.

41:22.640 --> 41:25.240
I'm like Snow White's apple.

41:25.320 --> 41:28.440
Beautiful on the outside,
but on the inside, I'm poisonous.

41:34.560 --> 41:37.160
Hi... Circle.

41:39.440 --> 41:40.440
No?

41:40.520 --> 41:42.000
What do I have to say?

41:42.080 --> 41:43.440
Are you listening? Hello!

41:44.320 --> 41:45.640
WELCOME TO THE CIRCLE

41:45.720 --> 41:46.640
It worked!

41:46.720 --> 41:49.600
What else do you have to say to me?

41:51.640 --> 41:53.280
"Set up your profile."

41:54.400 --> 41:56.760
Circle, open my albums.

41:58.920 --> 42:01.480
Look how pretty!

42:02.120 --> 42:04.880
Open the "Slayer" album.

42:06.840 --> 42:08.960
Circle, open the photo

42:09.040 --> 42:11.920
next to the yellow bikini picture.

42:13.880 --> 42:16.440
Aw, that photo is so cute!

42:16.520 --> 42:19.480
Let's save that one as my profile picture.

42:20.760 --> 42:22.080
You look gorgeous!

42:22.160 --> 42:24.920
Circle, write this down. Age...

42:25.000 --> 42:26.440
Twenty five years old.

42:26.520 --> 42:29.000
Made in the Manaus Industrial Sector,

42:29.080 --> 42:30.640
mixed-race,

42:30.720 --> 42:35.040
the mix between black, native, and white
made me a true Brazilian.

42:35.120 --> 42:37.160
Atypical Manaus native,

42:37.240 --> 42:39.320
dancer, and available.

42:39.400 --> 42:42.040
Nice to meet you. #Rayslayer.

42:42.280 --> 42:43.440
Post my profile.
