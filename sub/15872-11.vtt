00:01.500 --> 00:04.083
[Emma]  A few months ago,
I discovered I had
a twin sister.

00:04.083 --> 00:06.667
And then she asked me
to take her place.

00:06.667 --> 00:10.834
Keep the secret,
find our real mother
and try to stay alive.

00:10.834 --> 00:13.125
Put yourself in my shoes.

00:13.125 --> 00:16.125
How long could you keep up
the lying game?

00:16.125 --> 00:17.458
[Ethan]  Previously on
The Lying Game...

00:17.458 --> 00:18.583
You're not Sutton.

00:18.583 --> 00:21.125
When Sutton gets back,
you know what happens.

00:21.125 --> 00:22.208
Sutton is staying
with Thayer in L.A.,

00:22.208 --> 00:23.959
and I think
they're sleeping together.

00:23.959 --> 00:25.125
[Justin] It was my mom's.

00:25.125 --> 00:27.583
I am never taking this off.

00:27.583 --> 00:29.583
What happened to her?

00:29.583 --> 00:31.084
-Annie Sewell--
-[Ted] Who knows?

00:31.084 --> 00:32.542
I think she pretty much
fell off the grid.

00:32.542 --> 00:33.834
I want you.

00:33.834 --> 00:34.875
[door opens]

00:35.667 --> 00:38.458
-Oh, my God.
-Sutton.

00:38.458 --> 00:40.125
All it takes is a kiss,
right, Emma?

00:40.125 --> 00:42.542
She took your spoiled,
selfish life,
and turned it around!

00:42.542 --> 00:44.166
-[Sutton]
You're finished here.
-[Ethan] We saw her.

00:44.166 --> 00:46.542
Now I'm pretty sure
she's coming here
to drop her last bomb.

00:46.542 --> 00:49.167
I don't get it.
Why isn't she here?
She left before us.

00:49.167 --> 00:50.167
[screams]

00:55.625 --> 00:57.000
Annie?

00:57.000 --> 00:58.041
[thunder crashes]

00:58.834 --> 01:00.167
[Sutton screaming]

01:04.333 --> 01:06.166
My God! Annie?

01:08.333 --> 01:09.750
This is just so odd.

01:09.750 --> 01:13.042
We were...
We were just talking
about you, Ted and I.

01:13.042 --> 01:16.042
Oh, I can't imagine why.

01:17.458 --> 01:20.583
-And who is this?
-This is my daughter, Sutton.

01:20.583 --> 01:24.208
Sutton, this is Annie Sewell,
Phyllis' sister.

01:25.041 --> 01:27.708
-Hi.
-Actually, it's Rebecca now.

01:27.708 --> 01:30.041
I, uh, go by my middle name.

01:30.041 --> 01:33.333
I... I dropped "Annie"
as soon as I left town.

01:33.333 --> 01:35.834
Oh.

01:35.834 --> 01:38.917
Anyway, um,
it feels like I'm crashing,
but I'm really not.

01:38.917 --> 01:41.458
I spoke to Char,
and she invited me.

01:41.458 --> 01:44.083
Yes, of course.
Please, come in, have a drink.

01:44.083 --> 01:46.041
Everyone will be
so happy to see you.

01:46.041 --> 01:48.750
[chuckles]
Oh, that'd be great.

01:48.750 --> 01:52.084
Actually, Sutton, I saw you
blowing out candles.

01:52.084 --> 01:53.750
I guess a "happy birthday"
is in order.

01:54.834 --> 01:56.000
Yeah. Thank you.

01:56.000 --> 01:59.125
Yeah, and I caught
a little of your speech.

02:00.083 --> 02:01.875
It was...

02:01.875 --> 02:03.000
It was very stirring.

02:03.000 --> 02:04.500
It's a little confusing, but--

02:04.500 --> 02:07.291
We can talk about it
when we have a chance.

02:08.375 --> 02:09.458
Okay.

02:10.208 --> 02:11.917
[thunder rumbling]

02:17.166 --> 02:19.708
-Who was that?
-Well, I thought
it was Sutton.

02:19.708 --> 02:22.000
That's why
I stopped my speech,

02:22.000 --> 02:25.084
and it turns out
that it's Annie.

02:25.084 --> 02:29.583
I mean, Rebecca Sewell,
Char's aunt.

02:29.583 --> 02:31.000
Am I nuts,
or didn't you think--

02:31.000 --> 02:33.291
She was our
biological mother, yes.

02:33.291 --> 02:35.792
But that was Annie Hobbs.

02:35.792 --> 02:37.959
And still nothing from Sutton?

02:37.959 --> 02:39.417
-Not a word.
-It doesn't make sense.

02:39.417 --> 02:41.542
She... She was pissed.

02:41.542 --> 02:43.458
-Coming straight here.
-I know.

02:45.750 --> 02:46.834
-[sighs]
-What?

02:47.959 --> 02:49.750
A part of me

02:49.750 --> 02:52.084
wishes that
she would just show up

02:52.084 --> 02:53.792
all of this can just be
out in the open

02:53.792 --> 02:55.458
and then the other...

02:56.792 --> 02:59.000
-[sighs] Part hopes that--
-She'll never show up.

03:01.083 --> 03:02.708
Emma.

03:02.708 --> 03:04.167
No matter what happens,

03:04.167 --> 03:06.792
whether she does
or she doesn't,

03:06.792 --> 03:09.042
I'm not gonna let anything
come between us.

03:10.208 --> 03:11.917
Ever, okay?

03:14.167 --> 03:15.209
[Thayer] Ahem.

03:16.875 --> 03:18.792
Felt like you'd spill
the whole thing back there.

03:18.792 --> 03:20.083
I almost did.

03:20.083 --> 03:22.125
Preemptive strike, I like it.

03:22.125 --> 03:24.042
When'll you tell me
what happened
at the cabin?

03:24.042 --> 03:25.042
Doesn't matter.

03:26.167 --> 03:28.208
Things were said.
Sutton went off on us.

03:29.750 --> 03:31.167
Why don't we just call her?

03:32.250 --> 03:34.333
Find out where she is?
May I borrow your phone,
please?

03:34.333 --> 03:36.209
-Yeah.
-Thank you.

Actually, it's Rebecca now.

05:09.583 --> 05:12.250
And it's great news,
she's moving back to Phoenix.

were about?

by pretending to be me.

I was supposed to wear

06:18.167 --> 06:20.375

After a fight like that,
she'll regroup.

She'll plan something.
Some kind of revenge.

About those years?

in the past, right?

you were gonna suggest?

the same thing.

in her head,

-[Laurel] Mom, Dad!
-Oh, look, here's Laurel.

10:10.084 --> 10:12.042
Don't suppose there's
any way I could stay--

10:12.042 --> 10:13.875
No, you, in the car. No.

10:13.875 --> 10:16.917
-Um, this is Laurel.
-Char's aunt, right?

10:16.917 --> 10:19.792
-Nice to meet you, Ms. Sewell.
-Nice to meet you.

10:19.792 --> 10:21.166
-Okay.
-I guess we should be going.

10:21.166 --> 10:22.375
-Away we go.
-Bye.

10:22.375 --> 10:24.458
-Bye, Rebecca.
-Bye, Ted.

10:27.667 --> 10:28.667
Hello, Rebecca.

10:30.917 --> 10:33.125
-Ted told me about
the new moniker.
-Mmm.

10:35.125 --> 10:37.375
And that you've decided
to move back into town.

10:37.375 --> 10:39.417
What else did Ted tell you?

10:39.417 --> 10:41.125
You wanna keep
the past in the past.

10:43.167 --> 10:44.083
Do you think that's possible?

10:45.542 --> 10:47.333
Personally,
I'd like nothing better.

10:47.333 --> 10:49.291
But you're still suspicious.

10:49.291 --> 10:51.209
I don't have a suspicious
bone in my body.

10:51.209 --> 10:53.375
[scoffs]
Oh, some things
never change.

10:53.375 --> 10:56.208
-But you have.
-Yes. Yes, I have.

10:56.208 --> 10:58.291
I've had enough drama
in my life.

10:58.291 --> 11:00.542
I don't really wanna go
digging around for more.

11:00.542 --> 11:01.834
[man on PA]
Red Mercedes is here.

11:01.834 --> 11:04.209
This is me. Goodnight, Alec.

11:04.209 --> 11:05.250
You too, Annie.

11:09.084 --> 11:10.084
Rebecca.

11:24.375 --> 11:26.125
[Ted] It was our extra car.

11:26.125 --> 11:28.084
I mean, way back
when the nanny used it.

11:28.084 --> 11:30.959
Since then,
a housekeeper or two.

11:30.959 --> 11:33.291
I hauled some fertilizer
in it a couple weeks ago.

11:33.291 --> 11:36.209
All right, well I'm
gonna need the names
of everyone who had access.

11:36.209 --> 11:38.000
You said you had a key
hidden around here somewhere?

11:38.000 --> 11:40.333
-In a paint can on the shelf.
-What happened?

11:40.333 --> 11:41.875
[Ted] Well, we were
hoping you might know.

11:41.875 --> 11:43.667
You were the last one
here last night.

11:43.667 --> 11:45.083
Someone took the extra car.

11:46.333 --> 11:48.959
Uh...

11:48.959 --> 11:51.083
I didn't notice
anything when I left.

11:52.291 --> 11:53.792
I'm...

11:53.792 --> 11:56.500
I think that door was closed.
I'm pretty sure of it.

11:56.500 --> 11:58.375
[Kristin] Let me get you
that cup of coffee, Dan,

11:58.375 --> 12:00.375
and those names and numbers,
though I'm sure

12:00.375 --> 12:02.000
none of them
would have taken it.

12:02.000 --> 12:03.708
-I'm gonna walk Ethan out.
-Yeah.

12:07.583 --> 12:11.166
Okay, so now we know
how Sutton was
getting around town.

12:11.166 --> 12:12.792
Did you see
her car at the cabin?

12:12.792 --> 12:14.834
No.

12:14.834 --> 12:17.500
She would have hidden it,
probably around back.

12:17.500 --> 12:19.125
Sutton was here first.

12:19.125 --> 12:21.542
Intercepted the video chat
with me, then she
took the car.

12:21.542 --> 12:23.500
And now the police
are looking for it.

12:24.959 --> 12:27.041
-Is that a good thing?
-I don't know.

12:28.041 --> 12:30.667
Meanwhile,
I'm gonna get out there.

12:30.667 --> 12:32.333
See what I can find
at the cabin.

12:32.333 --> 12:34.792
I'll sleep there tonight
in case she turns up.

12:36.041 --> 12:37.125
Are you gonna be okay?

12:40.125 --> 12:41.125
Yeah.

12:49.291 --> 12:50.333
Happy birthday.

12:52.333 --> 12:53.542
Thanks.

12:53.542 --> 12:55.167
All right.

12:55.167 --> 12:57.125
-Be careful.
-I will.

12:57.125 --> 12:58.166
Okay.

13:01.167 --> 13:02.167
[sighs]

13:05.458 --> 13:07.917
Only one thing could explain
the current look on your face.

13:10.166 --> 13:11.625
You swiped the extra car.

13:12.542 --> 13:14.542
You did always
used to borrow it

13:14.542 --> 13:16.959
before you had
your actual license.

13:16.959 --> 13:20.583
Joy rides, meeting boyfriends,
trips to the reservoir.

13:20.583 --> 13:22.167
Remember how Dad
could never figure out

13:22.167 --> 13:23.500
why he was always
filling it up?

13:25.125 --> 13:28.041
I did not take the car, okay?

13:31.625 --> 13:33.125
You know, Sutton,

13:33.125 --> 13:35.125
you used to be
a much better liar.
[chuckles]

13:53.125 --> 13:55.667
What were you
doing last night?

13:55.667 --> 13:58.084
Get the Mercer car stripped
down, get all the parts sold?

14:00.167 --> 14:02.084
What were you
doing last night?

14:02.084 --> 14:03.041
Waiting for me to come home?

14:03.041 --> 14:05.000
I worked the graveyard.
It was a slow night.

14:05.000 --> 14:06.417
Mercer car was
your biggest case, huh?

14:06.417 --> 14:08.209
No murders? No bodies?

14:09.375 --> 14:11.875
[intense music]

14:12.875 --> 14:14.041
I don't know what
happened to the car.

14:16.000 --> 14:18.333
And I don't have to tell you
where I was last night.

14:18.333 --> 14:21.083
So have a nice day,
and all that.

14:22.834 --> 14:24.792
Ethan.

14:24.792 --> 14:26.792
Look, I know you're way into
this Mercer girl, all right?

14:28.458 --> 14:30.834
The closer you get to her,
the more I worry about you.

14:30.834 --> 14:32.125
Last night, I got a feeling.

14:34.041 --> 14:35.250
It was more about her
than you.

14:36.250 --> 14:38.708
You just can't trust
anyone with money.

14:38.708 --> 14:40.417
I just don't wanna see
you get burned, okay?

14:40.417 --> 14:42.750
Because if anyone gets
dragged down in all this,

14:42.750 --> 14:45.000
it's gonna be you, not her,
that's just the way it works,
man.

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
Just because you won't let
anyone into your life,

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
don't be pissed at me for
letting somebody into mine.

14:54.000 --> 14:55.166
[door slams]

14:56.417 --> 14:58.750
[Kristin] It's just
so much fun to see someone

14:58.750 --> 15:00.959
you haven't seen
since high school and...

15:00.959 --> 15:03.333
And Rebecca,
she's so different.

15:03.333 --> 15:05.375
I don't know,
I didn't really talk to her.

15:05.375 --> 15:08.125
More like
you were avoiding her.

15:08.125 --> 15:11.250
All that crazy stuff you
and Alec did in high school.

15:11.250 --> 15:14.208
Wonder how many other people
you drove out of town.

15:14.208 --> 15:16.083
We didn't drive anybody
out of town, okay?

15:16.875 --> 15:18.084
I'm kidding.

15:18.084 --> 15:20.250
I mean, she is just
so confident now.

15:20.250 --> 15:23.708
Even after what sounded
like this messy divorce.

15:23.708 --> 15:26.209
It's just so funny,
not too long ago,
do you remember this?

15:26.209 --> 15:27.542
You and I were
talking about her.

15:27.542 --> 15:29.333
You said she'd
fallen off the grid.

15:29.333 --> 15:31.542
Yeah, I said I'd heard
she'd fallen off the grid.

15:33.500 --> 15:35.084
[Sutton] Morning.
[Ted] Somebody overslept.

15:35.084 --> 15:36.667
Have you heard
anything about the car?

15:36.667 --> 15:38.625
[Ted] No. It'll turn up.
Don't worry.

15:38.625 --> 15:40.750
We should have gotten rid
of the clunker long ago.

15:40.750 --> 15:43.000
Worst gas mileage ever
in that guzzler.

15:43.000 --> 15:44.042
I am late.

15:44.708 --> 15:46.583
So, I am off to work.

15:47.583 --> 15:48.917
I got to go too.

15:48.917 --> 15:51.084
[Kristen] Wait, we need
to talk about what
happened last night.

15:51.084 --> 15:52.750
You made that whole speech.

15:52.750 --> 15:54.375
Said something about
the last few months,

15:54.375 --> 15:55.542
and then you just rushed out.

15:55.542 --> 15:57.834
Yeah, big wind-up,
no delivery.

15:59.084 --> 16:00.875
I just should have...

16:00.875 --> 16:03.667
Thought something
through beforehand.
[chuckles]

16:03.667 --> 16:05.125
I'll write something
down next time.

16:07.125 --> 16:08.792
[cell phone vibrating]

16:11.500 --> 16:13.375
Char's mom got a DUI.

16:13.375 --> 16:15.000
-Ooh.
-I have to go.

16:16.042 --> 16:18.000
[Emma] How are you
holding up, Char?

16:18.000 --> 16:20.083
Good. I called my dad.
He's coming back.

16:20.083 --> 16:22.625
Aunt Rebecca's
been a huge help.

16:22.625 --> 16:25.084
I'm just sorry for the way
my mom talks to you.

16:26.000 --> 16:27.375
Don't even think about it.

16:27.375 --> 16:28.583
Well, what can we do?

16:28.583 --> 16:30.750
Just tell them at school
that I can't make it.

16:30.750 --> 16:33.708
I'm going with Aunt Rebecca
to see my mom's lawyer.

16:33.708 --> 16:36.041
-We can handle that.
-Yeah. We'll stop by later.

16:36.041 --> 16:38.834
Sure. Thank you, guys.

16:38.834 --> 16:40.166
[Emma] Oh, you're welcome.

16:42.792 --> 16:44.208
-I'm gonna go grab my bag.
-Yeah.

16:46.125 --> 16:48.708
[Rebecca sighs] It just
breaks my heart.

16:48.708 --> 16:50.125
How long has this
been going on?

16:50.125 --> 16:53.000
Oh, I mean, kind of forever.

16:53.000 --> 16:54.875
[scoffs] We do
the best we can.

16:54.875 --> 16:58.000
Yeah, be here for her
and that sort of thing.

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
Yeah, I'm sure you are.

17:00.000 --> 17:02.667
And now that I'm here,
I can help out.

17:02.667 --> 17:07.208
[sighs] In fact, I think
I've got a good idea how.

17:07.208 --> 17:10.209
Nice to meet you.
Sutton, always a pleasure.

17:10.209 --> 17:12.167
-Bye.
-Bye.

17:12.167 --> 17:14.125
Who knew fairy godmothers
could be so cool?

17:15.125 --> 17:16.250
[school bell ringing]

17:16.250 --> 17:20.125
Then Justin does his whole
"Yes, sir, no, sir" thing.

17:20.125 --> 17:21.583
Which is totally sincere,
by the way.

17:22.125 --> 17:23.708
-Oh, my gosh.
-What?

17:24.542 --> 17:26.041
Forgot my bracelet.

17:26.041 --> 17:27.834
The one Justin gave me.

17:27.834 --> 17:29.417
His mother's, actually.

17:29.417 --> 17:32.291
Oh. Well, you don't
have to wear it every day.

17:33.125 --> 17:35.000
But I told him I would,
and I have.

17:40.667 --> 17:41.834
Can we talk later?

17:44.834 --> 17:45.834
Thanks.

17:50.250 --> 17:51.333
-Hey.
-Hi.

17:51.333 --> 17:53.208
So, I tried to
retrace her steps

17:53.208 --> 17:55.208
from the cabin
to the country club.

17:55.208 --> 17:57.166
But there's no sign
of the Mercer car.

17:58.125 --> 17:59.583
Here's another idea.

18:01.208 --> 18:03.500
-We come forward.
-It's an old idea.

18:03.500 --> 18:05.750
Ethan, don't you see
what's happening?

18:05.750 --> 18:08.291
The car's missing,
Sutton is missing.

18:09.250 --> 18:11.291
Why can't you see
that this makes sense?

18:11.291 --> 18:13.417
They're gonna blame us.

18:13.417 --> 18:16.333
-What?
-Thayer's already going there.

18:16.333 --> 18:18.333
And my brother's
not gonna be far behind.

18:18.333 --> 18:20.625
We had a fight at the cabin.

18:20.625 --> 18:21.917
And then she disappeared.

18:21.917 --> 18:22.959
And...

18:24.084 --> 18:25.834
And?

18:25.834 --> 18:27.333
You're impersonating her,
Emma.

18:27.333 --> 18:30.042
It could look like
you didn't want her
to have her life back.

18:30.042 --> 18:31.667
-So--
-So what, I took it?

18:33.209 --> 18:34.834
Ethan, that's crazy.
I wouldn't do that.

18:34.834 --> 18:37.125
I know you wouldn't.
I'm talking about
what it might look like.

18:38.458 --> 18:40.333
Oh, my God, do you think
it's possible that she's...

19:02.083 --> 19:03.750
[Girl] What was with you
today, Sutton?

19:03.750 --> 19:05.417
You lost in straight sets.

19:05.417 --> 19:07.542
Yeah, I was just
a little distracted.

19:07.542 --> 19:09.667
-I will see you guys later.
-Okay.

19:09.667 --> 19:11.417
-Hey.
-Hi.

19:11.417 --> 19:14.208
So have you heard from Char?
I was going to run over there.

19:14.208 --> 19:18.166
Oh, already did.
Rebecca was there again.

19:18.166 --> 19:19.625
She and Char have
already gotten really close.

19:21.167 --> 19:22.834
I was gonna get an iced tea.
Want one?

19:22.834 --> 19:24.209
Yeah. Thank you.

19:28.333 --> 19:30.084
I spent the day
looking for Sutton.

19:30.959 --> 19:33.084
Hotels, hangouts, hospitals.

19:33.084 --> 19:35.417
Yeah, I called Lexi in Vegas.
She said she'd keep
an eye out.

19:37.125 --> 19:39.167
I get off in ten minutes.
We can leave then.

19:39.167 --> 19:40.458
Where you going?

19:40.458 --> 19:42.125
You know what, Thayer,

19:42.125 --> 19:43.500
we really appreciate
your help,

19:43.500 --> 19:45.041
but this is
really our problem.

19:45.041 --> 19:48.166
Oh, really? So I'm not allowed
to give a damn where she is?

19:48.166 --> 19:49.667
[cell phone vibrating]

19:51.875 --> 19:52.959
My brother.

19:54.458 --> 19:55.542
They found the Mercer car.

19:57.000 --> 19:58.500
[Alec] You know,
it's not the first time

19:58.500 --> 20:01.125
that Phyllis has been
popped for drunk driving.

20:01.125 --> 20:03.208
No, I know, apparently
my sister's drinking problem

20:03.208 --> 20:06.875
is rather serious, and since
her parents are separated,

20:06.875 --> 20:09.375
Char's been taking care
of her own mother.

20:09.375 --> 20:12.042
My office really
has no choice here.

20:12.042 --> 20:14.000
You know, I mean,
I got her out last night,
but...

20:15.375 --> 20:17.583
The number of repeats and
the seriousness of the offense

20:17.583 --> 20:19.125
means my hands are tied.
It's not good.

20:19.125 --> 20:22.167
I know, I know.
I have an idea.

20:22.167 --> 20:25.125
I hope it's rehab.
I know Phyllis can afford it.

20:25.125 --> 20:27.250
No, it's just my understanding
that she's checked herself out

20:27.250 --> 20:29.125
after a couple of days
of rehab and then gone home

20:29.125 --> 20:30.375
and started
drinking again, so--

20:30.375 --> 20:31.750
That's what people do.

20:31.750 --> 20:34.000
Unless I propose a mandatory
sentence, there's no--

20:34.000 --> 20:37.458
Actually, yes, that's exactly
what I want you to do.

20:38.750 --> 20:40.083
Well, okay, you, uh...

20:41.083 --> 20:43.333
You pick the place,
I'll sign the papers.

20:43.333 --> 20:44.834
-Really?
-Absolutely.

20:48.375 --> 20:53.000
Just so surprised about
your divorce from Caroline.

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
I figured you two
to be lifers.

20:55.625 --> 20:57.375
Anything else on your mind?

20:57.375 --> 21:00.583
Well, it's just so nice
to see that you and Ted

21:00.583 --> 21:03.084
-are still so close
after all this time.
-Yeah.

21:03.084 --> 21:04.500
It doesn't always
work out that way.

21:04.500 --> 21:06.166
I can't imagine it
any other way.

21:08.041 --> 21:10.583
Guess we'll be in touch.
Thanks, Alec.

21:16.542 --> 21:17.625
[line ringing]

21:17.625 --> 21:18.959
This is Dr. Hughes.

21:18.959 --> 21:20.625
Dr. Hughes, Alec Rybak.

21:22.333 --> 21:24.917
Oh, yeah, yeah.

21:24.917 --> 21:26.542
An Annie showed up in Phoenix.

21:28.750 --> 21:30.083
But it's not Annie Hobbs.

21:31.500 --> 21:33.167
[police radio chatter]

21:43.375 --> 21:44.834
[Dan] That's far enough
right there.

21:46.083 --> 21:47.708
This your family's car,
Sutton?

21:48.250 --> 21:49.625
Yeah, that's it.

21:49.625 --> 21:51.083
Open it up, Harry.
Let's see what's inside.

22:17.000 --> 22:18.959
Is this purse and phone yours?

22:21.750 --> 22:23.042
Yeah.

22:23.042 --> 22:24.625
Well obviously, you took
the car then, didn't you?

22:25.917 --> 22:27.041
You want to tell me
what happened here?

22:28.583 --> 22:31.041
[stutters] Well,
it's complicated. I...

22:32.250 --> 22:33.250
We...

22:34.042 --> 22:35.084
-Okay--
-No, no.

22:36.375 --> 22:37.542
Dan, I took the car, okay?

22:40.042 --> 22:42.167
It was her birthday, and
she wanted to do something...

22:43.834 --> 22:45.917
Crazy and exciting.

22:45.917 --> 22:49.083
I mean, she used to take
the car all the time
to sneak out and see me.

22:49.083 --> 22:52.417
I lost control of it
and it ended up in the lake.

22:52.792 --> 22:53.792
I see.

22:54.792 --> 22:56.042
That how it went down, Sutton?

22:58.209 --> 23:00.084
Yeah, I was...

23:00.084 --> 23:02.667
Nostalgic. No, I...

23:02.667 --> 23:06.208
Well, with a big birthday
coming up I just wanted to...

23:06.208 --> 23:08.000
Relive the wildness.

23:09.167 --> 23:10.250
Stupid. I know. I...

23:10.250 --> 23:12.166
I just didn't...

23:13.750 --> 23:15.167
Wanna move on, I guess.

23:15.417 --> 23:17.209
Right.

23:17.209 --> 23:19.959
You were about to tell me
something else
before Ethan interrupted.

23:22.125 --> 23:24.084
-No. No, that was it.
-No?

23:24.084 --> 23:25.708
That's...
That's what happened.

23:25.708 --> 23:27.750
We should have said
something last night

23:27.750 --> 23:31.209
but my dad was just
so great about the party

23:31.209 --> 23:33.333
and I didn't want
to disappoint him.

23:33.333 --> 23:35.333
And we didn't think
you'd find the car.

23:37.125 --> 23:38.125
Of course.

23:40.167 --> 23:42.166
Well, let's go, you two.

23:43.125 --> 23:44.208
Prank,

23:44.208 --> 23:46.291
game,

23:46.291 --> 23:49.250
crazy trip down nostalgia
lane, I really don't care.

23:49.250 --> 23:50.458
I'm taking you in. Let's go.

23:54.042 --> 23:56.417
[Kristin] Gosh, thanks.
It's really good to know. Bye.

23:59.333 --> 24:00.750
[sighs]

24:00.750 --> 24:04.209
-Hey, who was that?
-Hey. Rebecca.

24:04.209 --> 24:06.291
She really stepped in
on the Phyllis thing.

24:07.250 --> 24:09.083
This will be good for Char.

24:09.083 --> 24:12.125
I mean, no kid
should have to shoulder
something like that alone.

24:12.125 --> 24:13.208
Sure, yeah.

24:13.208 --> 24:15.333
You know, when this is over,
I'm gonna ask her to lunch.

24:17.583 --> 24:19.084
Have either of you
guys seen my bracelet?

24:19.708 --> 24:21.667
-No.
-I've looked everywhere

24:21.667 --> 24:23.583
and I thought I might have
left it on my nightstand

24:23.583 --> 24:25.083
or the bathroom,
but it's disappeared.

24:25.083 --> 24:27.083
Well, it's a vintage bracelet.

24:27.083 --> 24:29.041
It couldn't have
cost you much.

24:29.041 --> 24:31.875
Justin gave it to me.
And it was his mother's.

24:31.875 --> 24:35.166
And it was a really special
gift, so I'm really screwed
if I don't find it.

24:35.166 --> 24:36.708
So, please keep an eye out.

24:40.208 --> 24:42.000
I know. I don't like
that she lied, either.

24:42.333 --> 24:43.375
But...

24:45.166 --> 24:46.458
Maybe it was too
intimate a gift

24:46.458 --> 24:47.750
and she didn't
want to alert us.

24:47.750 --> 24:49.291
Yeah, that's probably
the reason.

24:49.291 --> 24:52.959
I'm just wondering
whose idea it was
to keep it from us.

24:52.959 --> 24:55.959
I mean, well,
why would it be Justin's?

24:55.959 --> 24:57.041
[cell phone ringing]

24:57.041 --> 24:58.208
Right. Exactly.

24:59.959 --> 25:01.209
Hello?

25:01.209 --> 25:02.792
Well, Dan, who found the car?

25:02.792 --> 25:04.375
Some fisherman.

25:04.375 --> 25:07.083
And all we got
was Sutton's purse
and her cell phone.

25:07.083 --> 25:10.209
[police radio chatter]

25:10.209 --> 25:12.125
Dan, like I said,
you know, uh...

25:12.125 --> 25:14.375
For heaven sakes,
Sutton Mercer's
my goddaughter.

25:14.375 --> 25:16.125
-Ethan's your brother.
-I'm aware of that.

25:16.125 --> 25:18.125
I was just
following procedure.
We both were.

25:18.125 --> 25:20.208
[Harry] Sir, we know these
are friends of yours,

25:20.208 --> 25:22.000
but Dan did do
the right thing.

25:22.000 --> 25:23.750
I mean, they were acting
super strange.

25:25.417 --> 25:26.750
Super strange?

25:28.125 --> 25:30.333
Is that a new police term
I'm not familiar with?

25:31.917 --> 25:34.667
Just seeing Sutton's purse
and her phone in there...

25:34.667 --> 25:37.208
God, Ethan it completely
freaked me out. I...

25:37.208 --> 25:39.917
She's... She had to
have been in that car.

25:41.667 --> 25:42.708
[Alec] Hey, guys.

25:46.125 --> 25:47.209
Wow.

25:48.291 --> 25:49.291
[door shuts]

25:50.209 --> 25:52.125
Stealing cars, joyriding?

25:54.500 --> 25:56.542
Let me ask you a question.

25:56.542 --> 25:58.500
How many cars do you own
between the two of you?

25:59.625 --> 26:01.291
Told my brother a second ago.

26:01.291 --> 26:04.333
We were just out
reliving the glory days.

26:04.333 --> 26:05.458
Yeah.

26:05.458 --> 26:07.750
And before I had
my license and...

26:09.083 --> 26:10.166
My own car.

26:14.208 --> 26:15.959
Well, what do you guys
think we should do?

26:17.834 --> 26:22.000
Well, you...
You can just let us go.

26:24.417 --> 26:28.333
Seeing as how I am
your favorite goddaughter.

26:29.458 --> 26:30.750
[chuckling]

26:34.834 --> 26:38.209
Um, okay, what do we do
with James Dean here?

26:40.042 --> 26:41.667
You just do what you have to.

26:41.667 --> 26:42.708
Ethan.

26:45.750 --> 26:48.167
I'm sorry, Dr. Mercer,
uh, but this looks like

26:48.167 --> 26:49.708
a big step backwards
for Sutton.

26:49.708 --> 26:52.375
Yes, it does seem that way.

26:52.375 --> 26:55.375
But, Dan, you know
in your heart
Sutton is a good kid.

26:55.375 --> 26:58.208
He knows that. We all do.

26:58.208 --> 26:59.667
Alec, thanks for stopping by.

27:00.209 --> 27:01.917
Uh, look,

27:01.917 --> 27:04.792
we would like to take care
of this at home within the
family, if that's all right.

27:04.792 --> 27:06.208
We're not pressing charges.

27:06.208 --> 27:07.625
Coincidentally, neither am I.

27:08.667 --> 27:10.792
-Great.
-Dan, let them go.

27:10.792 --> 27:12.667
Just fill out that
accident report so Dr. Mercer

27:12.667 --> 27:14.625
can file it with his
insurance company, okay?

27:14.625 --> 27:16.333
-Thank you.
-No problem.

27:17.750 --> 27:19.542
You should have just
let me confess.

27:21.166 --> 27:25.166
That there's twins
and the whole thing.

27:25.166 --> 27:26.625
You know, it's not too late.

27:29.834 --> 27:31.042
I know.

27:31.542 --> 27:33.167
I know.

27:33.167 --> 27:34.417
I'll look guilty.

27:36.625 --> 27:38.625
You think she's dead,
don't you?

27:40.583 --> 27:41.834
I don't know.

27:49.042 --> 27:50.291
[sighs]

27:54.083 --> 27:57.083
[Emma] Well, I guess
this is where you throw
the book at me.

27:57.083 --> 28:00.834
Well, we're having a little
trouble believing any of it.

28:00.834 --> 28:02.166
Well, Alec believed us.

28:02.166 --> 28:05.125
I'm told it's a pretty scary
thing to crash a car into
a lake.

28:05.125 --> 28:07.125
You come to a party
and you don't mention
it to us?

28:07.125 --> 28:09.083
[Kristin] Honey,
you could have
been seriously hurt.

28:09.083 --> 28:11.375
Your dad and I are
really worried about you.

28:11.375 --> 28:13.041
[Ted] We have no choice,
you're grounded.

28:13.041 --> 28:15.750
School, tennis, home,
that's it.

28:15.750 --> 28:17.333
Nothing in between,
no late nights.

28:17.333 --> 28:19.125
[Kristin] It's not only that.
I mean, yes,

28:19.125 --> 28:21.000
and I would like to know,
why is this happening?

28:21.000 --> 28:23.583
Why now, after everything
that's gone on?

28:23.583 --> 28:25.083
I don't know.

28:25.083 --> 28:27.209
Well, you have to have
some kind of reason.

28:27.209 --> 28:28.708
I can't explain it!

28:28.708 --> 28:31.375
It is just as much a mystery
to me as it is to you!

28:37.375 --> 28:38.542
[door shuts]

28:40.167 --> 28:42.167
Crashed into a lake?

28:42.625 --> 28:44.209
That is just so awesome.

28:44.875 --> 28:47.542
I mean it. Like, truly epic.

28:47.542 --> 28:50.583
Can we just save the adulation
for tomorrow, Laurel?

28:50.583 --> 28:52.000
This has been insane.

28:53.084 --> 28:54.000
Good night.

28:55.708 --> 28:56.917
[sighs]

28:56.917 --> 28:58.042
[gasps]

28:59.250 --> 29:02.458
Thayer, why didn't you
use the front door?

29:02.458 --> 29:05.458
Well, I didn't think
your parents would be
allowing visitors right now.

29:05.458 --> 29:06.750
Yeah.

29:06.750 --> 29:08.500
So, they actually bought
the whole joyriding story?

29:08.500 --> 29:10.667
Well, my parents
certainly didn't.

29:10.667 --> 29:12.792
And it is not Ethan's fault.

29:12.792 --> 29:15.458
He had, like, a second
to come up with the story.

29:15.458 --> 29:18.667
Keeping you from
a complete and detailed
confession of the twins.

29:18.667 --> 29:20.125
Ugh.

29:20.125 --> 29:22.042
You don't think it's weird?

29:22.042 --> 29:24.000
You and Ethan have a fight
with Sutton at the cabin.

29:24.000 --> 29:26.417
She storms off, all pissed
and full of threats.

29:26.417 --> 29:29.084
You both realized
she was about to blow
your lives out of the water--

29:29.084 --> 29:30.125
I don't wanna talk about this.

29:31.375 --> 29:33.291
This back and forth,
being two people...

29:33.291 --> 29:35.542
Uh, it's exhausting.
I'm gonna lose it.

29:38.125 --> 29:39.625
What?

29:39.625 --> 29:42.291
After the fight at the cabin
you needed to stop her.

29:43.375 --> 29:45.042
And maybe one
or both of you did.

29:45.042 --> 29:46.542
That is insane.

29:46.542 --> 29:49.209
I went to the bus station
and then I went to the party.

29:49.209 --> 29:50.041
What about Ethan?

29:52.917 --> 29:55.209
You already know where he was.
He was at the party.

29:55.209 --> 29:57.917
Yeah, to stop her.
What if he'd already
stopped her?

29:57.917 --> 30:00.625
-Thayer, I am warning you--
-Just... Just think about it.

30:00.625 --> 30:03.250
Why else would
he keep you from saying
anything about Sutton?

30:03.250 --> 30:04.834
Hmm? I'll tell you why.

30:04.834 --> 30:07.041
Because, then,
the entire world
would be looking for her.

30:08.166 --> 30:10.333
I love him. He loves me.

30:12.375 --> 30:13.875
Which just might
explain everything.

30:13.875 --> 30:15.875
[intense music]

30:18.500 --> 30:19.583
[door clicks]

30:28.917 --> 30:30.458
[sighs]
I don't want to hear it.

30:30.458 --> 30:31.875
Yeah, well,
you're gonna hear it.

30:31.875 --> 30:33.208
It was stupid. I know.

30:33.208 --> 30:35.208
No, stupid was that story
you came up with.

30:35.875 --> 30:37.000
Come on.

30:38.000 --> 30:40.125
Tell me how that car really
got in the lake, Ethan.

30:41.667 --> 30:43.250
Yeah, that's what I thought.
You don't know, do you?

30:44.166 --> 30:46.042
You made up that story
to protect Sutton.

30:46.042 --> 30:49.792
She was the one
who took the car and somehow
it ended up in the lake.

30:49.792 --> 30:52.084
You were rescuing her
with that lie, weren't you?
Come on.

30:53.708 --> 30:54.834
Get out of my face.

30:55.375 --> 30:56.834
Yeah, or what?

30:58.041 --> 30:59.333
What are you gonna do?

31:01.208 --> 31:03.667
It's been
my experience that...

31:03.667 --> 31:05.834
Behind every punk,

31:05.834 --> 31:08.041
behind every
slacker delinquent
is a pretty face.

31:10.042 --> 31:11.834
Sure, man, sure. You can...

31:11.834 --> 31:14.208
You can rescue her
day after day after day
if you want to,

31:14.208 --> 31:16.167
it don't matter.

31:16.167 --> 31:18.209
You should ask yourself
one question.

31:19.542 --> 31:21.375
When things get
really, really bad...

31:23.042 --> 31:24.000
Think she'll be there for you?

31:24.625 --> 31:26.625
[intense music]

31:32.750 --> 31:34.084
[school bell ringing]

31:35.750 --> 31:38.166
Come on, it was some kind
of a lying game, right?

31:38.166 --> 31:41.125
Like sophomore summer,
before you got your license?

31:41.125 --> 31:42.834
You used to take that
car out every Saturday

31:42.834 --> 31:44.583
and then we'd siphon gas
from your mom's car.

31:45.834 --> 31:48.000
And we even gave it
that name, Sylvia,

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
after your last housekeeper.

31:50.000 --> 31:53.166
Wow, Mads,
you have a good memory.

31:53.166 --> 31:54.250
[both chuckling]

31:55.000 --> 31:57.041
Hey, Mads.
I just saw Char inside.

31:58.500 --> 32:01.041
Oh, I know. She wanted
to meet before class.

32:01.041 --> 32:02.625
I'd better get going.

32:06.542 --> 32:07.750
We need to talk.

32:13.125 --> 32:14.708
I called you three times.

32:15.583 --> 32:17.917
I was busy
with the family and...

32:17.917 --> 32:18.917
And what?

32:21.542 --> 32:24.542
And... Could you please
let go of my arm?

32:25.750 --> 32:27.042
I'm sorry.

32:27.667 --> 32:29.041
What happened after the cabin?

32:29.041 --> 32:31.583
-With Sutton?
-The cabin?

32:31.583 --> 32:33.792
The fight.

32:33.792 --> 32:36.125
I told you.
I went to the party
to look for Sutton.

32:38.167 --> 32:39.250
You think I did something?

32:40.083 --> 32:41.208

32:42.750 --> 32:45.417
You just jumped in
so quickly at the lake...

32:48.042 --> 32:50.417
-Who put this in your head?
-It doesn't matter.

32:50.417 --> 32:54.708
Uh. It couldn't have been Dan.
He hasn't had the chance.

32:54.708 --> 32:56.083
It wasn't your parents.

32:58.125 --> 32:59.041

[school bell ringing]

33:02.667 --> 33:05.125
-I have to go to class.
-Come on, was it?

33:05.667 --> 33:06.917
Was it Thayer?

33:10.041 --> 33:12.042
It's my dad's car.
He'll be right out.

33:14.291 --> 33:15.959
-Thanks a lot.
-Yep.

33:20.458 --> 33:23.166
-You got a second?
-Kind of depends.

33:23.166 --> 33:24.625
You've got a second. Come on.

33:27.500 --> 33:29.000
What'd you say to her?

33:29.000 --> 33:31.542
Well, nothing.
I just posited a theory,
that's all.

33:31.542 --> 33:35.083
Posit it to my face,
why don't you?

33:35.083 --> 33:37.834
Do you really think
I did something to Sutton?

33:37.834 --> 33:40.125
Yeah, well, you had
the strongest motive.

33:40.125 --> 33:42.375
You had to stop her before
she got to that party.

33:42.375 --> 33:43.750
Any way you could.

33:43.750 --> 33:45.167
You're out of line
right now, man.

33:45.167 --> 33:47.125
All right, boys.
That's enough.

33:47.125 --> 33:50.250
-What seems to be the problem?
-Nothing, we're just talking.

33:50.250 --> 33:52.125
Okay, well, there's
a big queue of members

33:52.125 --> 33:53.667
lining up over there
waiting for their cars.

33:53.667 --> 33:55.250
Maybe you ought to
get back to your station.

33:57.959 --> 33:59.625
Wasn't about Sutton, was it?

33:59.625 --> 34:01.000
No, it wasn't.

34:03.417 --> 34:06.000
Little piece of advice to you,
if you can take it.

34:06.000 --> 34:08.625
Sutton is a road you
never wanna go down.

34:08.625 --> 34:10.209
Ever. Hey.

34:12.083 --> 34:14.125
-Okay? All right.
-Okay.

34:16.708 --> 34:18.000
If you'd help me
with this paper

34:18.000 --> 34:19.708
I could get it done
a lot faster.

You're thinking
about Sutton again?

that she's crazy about.

34:34.167 --> 34:35.834
It's not just about that.

34:35.834 --> 34:37.834
Sure it is.
You just can't accept it.

34:37.834 --> 34:40.500
She's in love with him,
not you.

34:40.500 --> 34:42.583
And there's nothing
you can do to get her back.

34:47.042 --> 34:49.458
Hmm, what?
There is something you can do?
