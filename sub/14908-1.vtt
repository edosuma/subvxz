01:10.155 --> 01:12.055
Shhh.

01:12.091 --> 01:14.616
You go back to sleep now, Kenneth.
Mama's gotta work.

01:57.469 --> 01:59.562
Wait a second, wait...

02:08.146 --> 02:10.479
Bitch!

02:55.093 --> 02:58.859
Freakdog.

03:22.487 --> 03:24.853
Emergency units are responding

03:24.890 --> 03:27.882
to a multi-vehicle pileup
on I-95 North.

03:27.926 --> 03:30.326
Forthaven PD are
advising motorists

03:30.362 --> 03:32.159
to avoid all approach routes

03:32.197 --> 03:35.462
to Forthaven County General
until further notice.

03:35.500 --> 03:38.333
This sounds like
a bad one, folks,

03:38.370 --> 03:43.501
so keep it locked
on Forthaven WSVU 87.3

03:43.542 --> 03:45.806
for all the news as it happens.

03:45.844 --> 03:48.005
I'm Dan Masters.
And coming up on...

03:51.717 --> 03:53.548
Vitals?

03:53.585 --> 03:56.007
Still in VF,
20 minutes.

03:58.924 --> 04:02.087
Continue chest compressions.

04:02.127 --> 04:04.152
Defib charge, 360.

04:04.196 --> 04:06.130
Clear.

04:06.164 --> 04:09.930
- Asystolic.
- Zero output.

04:11.336 --> 04:13.861
- Nothing.
- Dr. Thomas.

04:15.207 --> 04:17.869
We go again.

04:17.909 --> 04:19.637
We stop.

04:19.678 --> 04:22.306
Team direction
assured and timely...

04:22.347 --> 04:25.441
no patient could ask for more.

04:25.484 --> 04:27.315
Okay, put Mr. D back in his box

04:27.352 --> 04:30.048
and everybody report
to me in my office for analysis.

04:30.088 --> 04:32.784
Onward and upward.

04:32.824 --> 04:34.815
You did good, Cat.

04:34.860 --> 04:37.385
Yo, Cat!

04:37.429 --> 04:39.329
- Ever made it with a stiff?
- Jesus.

04:46.038 --> 04:49.371
Harris, Harris.

04:49.408 --> 04:52.036
I am sorry.
I meant to ring you.

04:52.077 --> 04:55.535
It was very close,
if that's any consolation.

04:55.580 --> 04:58.811
No.

04:58.850 --> 05:01.182
These your wunderkinder?

05:01.219 --> 05:02.550
Our jobs are safe.

05:05.424 --> 05:08.086
- With me.
- So what's with Harris?

05:08.126 --> 05:10.890
His last research project
was high on ambition,

05:10.929 --> 05:12.760
but low on patient safety.

05:12.798 --> 05:14.959
They pulled the funding
and transferred him here.

05:15.000 --> 05:17.161
Yeah, with the rest
of us rejects.

05:18.804 --> 05:22.831
The adrenergic effects of first-line
drugs on cardiac arrest are?

05:22.874 --> 05:25.104
Augment coronary
diastolic pressure,

05:25.143 --> 05:28.010
increase of endocardio perfusion
during compression.

05:28.046 --> 05:30.674
Tell me that isn't
your best shot.

05:30.716 --> 05:31.876
Show-off.

05:31.917 --> 05:34.715
Jesus, you two fucking eggheads
need to get out a whole lot more.

05:34.753 --> 05:37.017
- Oh, Harriet, you're quite subtle, eh?
- All right.

05:37.055 --> 05:39.990
Enough already.
Tonight we party.

05:40.025 --> 05:41.583
A-fucking-men.

05:41.626 --> 05:44.561
I can't. I need to research
why Mr. D didn't make it today.

05:44.596 --> 05:47.963
Cat, you do know that Mr. D is
brain-dead and made of plastic, right?

05:47.999 --> 05:50.968
Like every fucking man.
Fuck Mr. D.

05:51.002 --> 05:53.436
Something I'm sure
you've considered, Harriet.

05:53.472 --> 05:57.203
No way. I'm still waiting for
Mr. B to call me. I feel so used.

05:57.242 --> 05:59.733
- Jake's gonna be there.
- And?

05:59.778 --> 06:03.009
Well, I'm sick of this
"I'm too busy for a boyfriend" bullshit.

06:03.048 --> 06:05.278
He's hot. You're hot.
Make it happen.

06:05.317 --> 06:08.081
Yeah, Cat, put out already or those
Johns Hopkins sluts will eat him alive.

06:08.120 --> 06:09.109
Thanks.

06:15.193 --> 06:18.128
Yeah, Cat, put out already or those
Johns Hopkins sluts will eat him alive.

06:18.163 --> 06:19.152
Thanks.

06:22.033 --> 06:24.866
Anyway, I already
told him you're coming.

06:24.903 --> 06:27.428
What?
- And that you want him to be there.

06:27.472 --> 06:29.599
Oh, you fucking...

06:29.641 --> 06:32.735
Hey, get your kicks
creeping around like this?

06:37.048 --> 06:39.608
Hello, C-C-Catherine.

06:43.855 --> 06:47.552
- He is seriously weird.
- He's harmless.

06:47.592 --> 06:49.184
It's typical Catherine:

06:49.227 --> 06:51.752
"Bring me your waifs and strays
and your unwashed masses."

06:51.797 --> 06:54.357
Next thing you know, you'll be
giving a bum a bed or an orphan a...

06:54.399 --> 06:56.663
Harriet!
- Jesus, Cat, I'm sorry.

06:56.701 --> 06:58.134
Don't worry about it.

07:02.641 --> 07:05.337
Hey, Walt, working first-class tonight?
I'm impressed.

07:05.377 --> 07:08.312
One night only.
Back to the underworld tomorrow.

07:08.346 --> 07:10.075
- Be safe home.
- See ya.

07:34.406 --> 07:36.169
He's adorable.

07:36.208 --> 07:38.506
Thanks. It's his birthday today.
One month.

07:38.543 --> 07:41.307
- Coochi-fucking-coo.
- Yo, he hung?

07:41.346 --> 07:43.974
- He's his father's son.
- That's why I asked.

07:45.383 --> 07:47.408
You still living it up
in your parents' mansion?

07:47.452 --> 07:48.919
- Huh, jealous?
- Do I look it?

07:48.954 --> 07:50.979
- Yeah.
- Then that answers the question.

07:51.022 --> 07:54.355
So, Jake...

07:54.392 --> 07:56.792
you see Cat
in the ER today?

07:58.096 --> 08:00.257
When she's
in the zone like that,

08:00.298 --> 08:03.062
all hot and bothered,
full of passion...

08:04.703 --> 08:07.365
...she's incredible, right?
- Yeah, she's...

08:07.405 --> 08:09.896
she's very impressive.

08:09.941 --> 08:14.105
No, not as impressive as a research
fellowship at Johns Hopkins.

08:14.145 --> 08:16.773
A possible research fellowship
at Johns Hopkins,

08:16.815 --> 08:19.147
but thank you, yes, it's very cool.

08:19.184 --> 08:21.880
Well, you deserve it.

08:21.920 --> 08:23.979
But we'll miss you.

08:24.022 --> 08:26.957
Well, I'm not gone yet.
You have me for a month or so.

08:29.995 --> 08:31.758
What do you say, guys?

08:31.796 --> 08:34.890
Prognosis: wasted.

08:34.933 --> 08:38.061
- Fuck yeah.
- Whoo!

08:43.008 --> 08:45.875
Whoo!

09:12.704 --> 09:16.003
- Night, Crystal.
- See you guys.

09:22.547 --> 09:25.710
Oh God, please. Guys...

09:25.750 --> 09:27.684
Oh, fuck.

09:27.719 --> 09:31.246
- Hello... Catherine.
- No.

09:31.289 --> 09:33.189
Hi.

09:33.224 --> 09:35.283
Uh...

09:35.327 --> 09:38.319
maybe I-I could...

09:38.363 --> 09:41.526
Drop dead?

09:41.566 --> 09:44.034
No no.

09:47.005 --> 09:50.304
- walk-walk... walk you home?

09:52.110 --> 09:55.204
Cat's not your type.
She's got a pulse.

09:55.246 --> 09:58.181
Fucking freakdog.

09:58.216 --> 10:00.116
Guys.

10:00.151 --> 10:04.019
You have a potty-mouth.

10:04.055 --> 10:07.115
Yeah, I'm crushed.
Fuck off.

10:10.028 --> 10:13.862
Thanks, Kenneth, but I'm just
gonna hang out here for a while.

10:13.898 --> 10:16.264
Sure, yeah.

10:16.301 --> 10:19.168
Okay.

10:19.204 --> 10:22.799
- Having a party, right?
- Yeah, that's right.

10:22.841 --> 10:26.436
- You're not invited.
- You're still here?

10:26.478 --> 10:28.446
- We're closed.
- He's just leaving.

10:31.683 --> 10:33.913
- Enjoy your party.
- We will.

10:37.722 --> 10:40.384
What's with that fucking jacket?

10:40.425 --> 10:42.052
Adios, loser.

10:45.397 --> 10:48.366
The guy's a fucking freakdog.

10:55.807 --> 10:57.832
And your drugs, Sean.

11:00.245 --> 11:02.304
Keep walking, retard.

11:02.347 --> 11:05.373
The-the ones that are
in your pocket.

11:07.619 --> 11:10.520
The ones from the...
from the pharmacy.

11:10.555 --> 11:15.254
The ones you probably
shouldn't have.

11:19.464 --> 11:22.865
- You're deluded.
- No no.

11:22.901 --> 11:26.132
See, I, uh...

11:26.171 --> 11:28.731
I recorded you.

11:28.773 --> 11:30.240
What?

11:30.275 --> 11:33.108
Hey, I said we're closed!

11:33.144 --> 11:36.079
- Okay.
- This guy's out of control.

11:36.114 --> 11:38.105
Shit, guys.
- Oh my God.

11:38.149 --> 11:40.117
Hospital policy is
zero tolerance.

11:40.151 --> 11:42.210
- Guys, this is really bad.
- Shit.

11:42.253 --> 11:44.312
Oh man,
what a fucking mess.

11:44.355 --> 11:46.949
Slow down, okay?
The hospital doesn't know.

11:46.991 --> 11:49.516
- Not yet.
- We gotta get him back.

11:49.561 --> 11:52.257
- Catherine.
- What?

11:52.297 --> 11:55.095
- Come on, he likes you.
- Oh, man.

11:55.133 --> 11:57.397
- Catherine, seriously.
- Come on.

11:59.437 --> 12:02.873
Go. Go.

12:05.744 --> 12:07.439
Kenneth, wait.

12:07.479 --> 12:11.210
Hey, why don't you
come back inside

12:11.249 --> 12:13.809
and we can all talk
and hang out?

12:13.852 --> 12:18.016
M-me?

12:18.056 --> 12:20.786
Yeah, you.

12:27.198 --> 12:29.098
Okay.

12:29.134 --> 12:31.159
Come on.

12:34.205 --> 12:36.605
Man, I'm gonna enjoy
fucking this guy up.

12:36.641 --> 12:39.872
- Keep it flowing, man. Fill it up.
- He's gonna have a good time.

12:39.911 --> 12:42.141
Record this, Kenneth,
you little fucker.

12:45.116 --> 12:46.447
You okay, Kenneth?

12:46.484 --> 12:48.349
Yeah yeah, I'm okay.

12:48.386 --> 12:51.583
You know, I guess we all need
to party from time to time.

12:51.623 --> 12:54.717
You know,
let off some steam.

12:54.759 --> 12:57.819
Yeah, I know that.
I know that.

12:57.862 --> 13:01.491
We're all friends now, right?

13:01.533 --> 13:04.195
Yeah, of course.

13:08.039 --> 13:09.529
Sure thing.

13:09.574 --> 13:11.565
Got it, got it.

13:11.609 --> 13:14.237
So I guess getting
people wasted is the only way

13:14.279 --> 13:16.179
you can get them
to do what you want?

13:16.214 --> 13:18.910
Hey, if that's how you want
to justify a night of passion,

13:18.950 --> 13:22.351
- that's up to you.
- I don't remember any passion.

13:22.387 --> 13:24.685
Don't worry. I do.

13:24.722 --> 13:26.155
Just go fuck him up.

13:26.191 --> 13:29.388
Hey, Sean, Kenneth's fine,
so just leave him. It's cool.

13:29.427 --> 13:31.918
You sure about that, Catherine?

13:31.963 --> 13:33.555
I'm not taking any chances.

13:33.598 --> 13:35.498
Yo, Kenny!

13:35.533 --> 13:37.660
You wanna sip cow's piss
with the old ladies?

13:37.702 --> 13:39.795
Or do you wanna play
with the big boys?

13:39.838 --> 13:43.001
You've got some catching up
to do, my friend.

13:43.041 --> 13:44.633
Kenneth, you don't
have to do this.

13:44.676 --> 13:47.839
God, are you his fucking mom?
Thank you.

13:47.879 --> 13:50.439
Come on, Kenny, you're one
of us, boy. Get in here!

13:50.481 --> 13:52.312
Come on!
- Get ahold of that!

13:52.350 --> 13:54.341
- Whoo!
- Get up, get up here!

13:54.385 --> 13:56.649
Yeah, Kenny boy.

13:56.688 --> 13:59.350
- We like that. Get it up. Come on.
- Hey, you okay?

13:59.390 --> 14:01.358
- I don't know.
- Come on, get into it, baby.

14:01.392 --> 14:05.453
- It'll be fine.
- Oh yeah, it's the Freakdog!

14:05.496 --> 14:08.693
Freakdog, Freakdog, Freakdog!

14:15.607 --> 14:17.302
Whoo!

14:17.342 --> 14:21.745
Put it in your mouth, chicken!

14:30.455 --> 14:32.946
Oh my God.
- Jesus.

14:32.991 --> 14:36.290
What the fuck?

14:36.327 --> 14:39.262
Jesus.
- Who did that to you?

14:39.297 --> 14:41.891
You did that,
didn't you, Kenneth?

14:43.334 --> 14:46.235
No no, you don't know.

14:47.438 --> 14:50.100
You know n-n... nothing about me.

14:50.141 --> 14:52.905
You're right, Kenneth, we don't
know you, and we're so sorry.

14:52.944 --> 14:55.378
You're not fucking sorry.

14:55.413 --> 14:58.678
You're not.
You're never fucking sorry.

14:58.716 --> 15:00.946
You-you-you...

15:00.985 --> 15:03.783
you're all high and mighty

15:03.821 --> 15:07.917
with your wiseass comments.

15:07.959 --> 15:10.951
You're all the fucking same.

15:10.995 --> 15:13.987
You're bastards!

15:14.032 --> 15:17.627
You...

15:24.642 --> 15:27.736
Kenneth!

15:32.150 --> 15:35.586
Harriet, kill the strobe.
He's an epileptic and he's fitting.

15:35.620 --> 15:38.020
- He can't breathe.
- He needs an airway now.

15:39.023 --> 15:41.821
Just keep calm, okay.
Keep the fuck calm!

15:43.061 --> 15:45.586
Okay, when I cut, breech him.

15:45.630 --> 15:47.427
Steve, don't be nuts.

15:47.465 --> 15:49.524
Steve, ignore him.
He needs a tracheostomy now.

15:49.567 --> 15:50.932
- Steve!
- Shut up, Sean!

15:50.969 --> 15:53.494
You do this, Steve, you might as well
write your fucking name on him.

15:53.538 --> 15:57.599
- Give me that.
- Fuck you, asshole.

15:57.642 --> 15:59.166
Fuck.

15:59.210 --> 16:01.508
- Cat, no. Just listen to me!
- Get off of me.

16:01.546 --> 16:03.741
- What the hell are you doing, Cat?
- Get off of me.

16:03.781 --> 16:05.544
- He needs help!
- Don't do this!

16:05.583 --> 16:07.312
Jesus, Sean,
what the hell are you doing?

16:07.352 --> 16:09.616
- Get the fuck off me!
- Wait, look.

16:09.654 --> 16:13.090
His airway's cleared.

16:13.124 --> 16:15.957
I think he's still breathing.

16:15.994 --> 16:18.326
All right, fuck this.
I'm calling an ambulance.

16:18.363 --> 16:20.490
Jake, we're high as shit.

16:20.531 --> 16:23.193
We're with a guy pumped
full of stolen hospital drugs.

16:23.234 --> 16:25.668
- How's that gonna look?
- All right, fuck.

16:25.703 --> 16:27.500
We don't have time to wait.
Let's go.

16:27.538 --> 16:30.098
We call an ambulance,
we're officially involved.

16:30.141 --> 16:33.872
It's on the record.
They have to act, make an example.

16:33.911 --> 16:36.436
Zero tolerance.
Zero exceptions.

16:37.515 --> 16:41.144
Daddy might not be able
to buy you out of this one, Kim.

16:41.185 --> 16:43.847
Hell, he might not
even want to.

16:43.888 --> 16:46.516
Talking of daddies...

16:46.557 --> 16:48.582
your new visa,
Harriet, revoked.

16:48.626 --> 16:50.617
I'll send ya a postcard.

16:50.661 --> 16:52.720
Like you give a fuck
about anyone, Sean.

16:52.764 --> 16:55.790
Jake, your perfect
record is blown.

16:55.833 --> 16:58.028
Johns Hopkins won't
wanna know you.

16:58.069 --> 17:00.333
It sucks, but it's fact.

17:00.371 --> 17:03.363
- Enough, Sean!
- You want your prognosis?

17:03.408 --> 17:04.897
Here it is:

17:04.942 --> 17:08.343
fucked, flatlined,
do not resuscitate,

17:08.378 --> 17:10.813
wipe your tears with
your cheap-ass scholarship

17:10.848 --> 17:12.941
- on the way back to Hicksville.
- Fuck you.

17:12.983 --> 17:14.974
You're with us, Catherine.

17:15.019 --> 17:17.749
Drugs or no drugs,
you're gone.

17:18.790 --> 17:21.623
All right, Sean, hold up.

17:21.659 --> 17:25.185
We take him to ER
and we say we found him.

17:25.229 --> 17:27.628
It makes no difference.
It still ties him to us.

17:27.665 --> 17:31.226
And when he wakes up and starts
bitching to anybody who will listen,

17:31.269 --> 17:33.965
it's gonna look pretty
fucking dismal for us. Trust me.

17:38.242 --> 17:41.075
We dump him outside.
There's no connection.

17:41.112 --> 17:43.137
And what if nobody finds him?

17:43.181 --> 17:45.206
- No, they will.
- You don't know that, Kim.

17:45.249 --> 17:47.649
- Okay, none of you know that.
- No, yes.

17:47.685 --> 17:50.347
That way he still gets help
and we're not connected.

17:50.388 --> 17:53.448
Sean, you can drive.

17:53.491 --> 17:56.289
Oh, and what happens
when Kenneth comes to...

17:56.327 --> 17:58.761
if he comes to? You think
he's just gonna forgive and forget?

17:58.796 --> 18:00.923
You think he's gonna
keep quiet about this?

18:00.965 --> 18:03.866
It's his word against ours.

18:03.901 --> 18:05.630
We deny everything.

18:05.670 --> 18:08.264
It's easier to do minus
some half-assed trache hole.

18:08.306 --> 18:11.901
We stick together.
We never saw him tonight.

18:11.943 --> 18:14.241
We weren't here.
Nobody, okay?

18:14.278 --> 18:16.838
Harriet's right.
Dump him.

18:16.881 --> 18:19.008
Oh Jesus,
this isn't happening.

18:19.050 --> 18:21.416
It's gotta happen.
If it doesn't, we're screwed,

18:21.452 --> 18:24.649
end of fucking story!

18:37.668 --> 18:40.831
Come on,
get him out of here.

18:40.872 --> 18:44.103
- Push him, come on!
- Go go go!

18:57.021 --> 18:59.012
Cat?

18:59.056 --> 19:02.287
Are you in there?

19:02.326 --> 19:05.386
Look, nobody saw us.
It's done.

19:05.429 --> 19:08.865
Cat?

19:08.900 --> 19:12.336
Cat, this is all gonna
work out for the better, okay?

19:12.370 --> 19:14.031
You'll see.

19:34.659 --> 19:36.422
Forthaven General.

19:36.460 --> 19:39.293
Yes, hi, I'm calling
about a patient.

19:39.330 --> 19:41.195
An inpatient?
- Mm-hmm.

19:41.232 --> 19:44.929
- Name of patient?
- Kenneth, Kenneth Chisholm.

19:44.969 --> 19:47.437
Are you a relative?

19:47.471 --> 19:50.770
No. No, I'm a friend.

19:50.808 --> 19:54.107
Well, I'm afraid...
- Can you please tell me something,

19:54.145 --> 19:56.670
anything about him?

19:56.714 --> 19:59.205
Can you hold, please?
- Yeah, I'll hold.

20:02.954 --> 20:06.321
He's in intensive care.
Sorry, that's all I can tell you.

20:06.357 --> 20:09.758
Thank you.

20:18.135 --> 20:21.104
Kenneth's in a coma.

20:24.609 --> 20:26.941
Jesus.

20:26.978 --> 20:28.639
Oh my God.

20:28.679 --> 20:31.307
Jesus.

20:35.820 --> 20:39.085
It seemed our self-indulgent
ass-saving debate

20:39.123 --> 20:42.786
lasted just long enough
to starve him of oxygen to the brain.

20:42.827 --> 20:46.422
- People come out of comas, right?
- In a lot of cases, yes.

20:46.464 --> 20:48.625
Yeah, but in this case,

20:48.666 --> 20:51.260
he consumed high levels
of alcohol and narcotics.

20:51.302 --> 20:53.736
I mean, in this case,

20:53.771 --> 20:56.740
his brain was starved
of oxygen for way too long.

20:58.609 --> 21:01.874
Let's just be clear, Yoshimi.
This isn't locked-in syndrome.

21:01.912 --> 21:04.710
This isn't persistent
vegetative state.

21:04.749 --> 21:08.048
This is deep coma.

21:10.721 --> 21:12.279
We're all upset too, Cat.

21:12.323 --> 21:14.791
Good.

21:15.893 --> 21:18.953
So let's just go to Dr. Stegman
and tell him what happened.

21:18.996 --> 21:21.260
No no!

21:21.299 --> 21:24.063
Are you out of
your fucking mind?

21:24.101 --> 21:28.401
Look, this is a shame, okay?

21:30.141 --> 21:32.109
But let's be logical.

21:32.143 --> 21:37.046
If he's asleep, he can't move.
He can't talk.

21:37.081 --> 21:39.811
What good does
telling anyone do?

21:39.850 --> 21:42.842
It's the right thing to do.

21:42.887 --> 21:44.946
Catherine...

21:44.989 --> 21:46.923
we need to have
each other's backs here.

21:46.957 --> 21:49.482
We just need to stick together.
There's no point in...

21:49.527 --> 21:51.859
No point?

21:51.896 --> 21:54.660
Kim, what we did might cause
somebody to die.

21:54.699 --> 21:57.031
Keep your voice down.
Kim's right.

21:57.068 --> 22:00.799
- Don't fucking speak for me, Sean.
- Okay, fine fine.

22:00.838 --> 22:03.602
I won't.

22:03.641 --> 22:06.542
You can speak
for yourself, Kim.

22:06.577 --> 22:08.374
You all can.

22:09.880 --> 22:13.873
And we all did... last night.

22:13.918 --> 22:16.716
Kenneth's in a coma.
It's a tragedy,

22:16.754 --> 22:19.314
but we can't change that.

22:19.357 --> 22:21.882
You talk, Cat, and you'll
fuck everyone's life up

22:21.926 --> 22:24.394
and you won't have changed
one damn thing for Kenneth.

22:24.428 --> 22:27.886
You wanna go and confess?
Knock yourself out.

22:27.932 --> 22:30.730
Good luck finding
another scholarship.

22:32.103 --> 22:34.196
But let me be clear:

22:34.238 --> 22:36.331
I'll be denying everything.

22:40.044 --> 22:41.705
Right.

22:44.815 --> 22:46.680
So if Kenneth can't talk,

22:46.717 --> 22:48.582
it just didn't happen.

22:48.619 --> 22:51.417
No, it happened.

22:51.455 --> 22:53.650
And we'll never
get away from that.

22:55.126 --> 22:57.594
But it's done.

23:12.877 --> 23:15.437
Kim.

24:02.026 --> 24:03.994
I'm sorry.

24:04.028 --> 24:06.121
What's wrong?

24:06.163 --> 24:08.188
Dr. Harris.

24:08.232 --> 24:10.860
Yeah, and you're one of
Dr. Stegman's, aren't you?

24:10.901 --> 24:13.631
What are you sorry for?

24:13.671 --> 24:16.663
I've taken an interest
in coma care,

24:16.707 --> 24:20.473
so I'm sorry I can't
help this patient.

24:22.079 --> 24:24.013
Ah.

24:25.349 --> 24:27.749
Let me tell you something,

24:27.785 --> 24:30.720
something that
Dr. Stegman won't tell you.

24:30.754 --> 24:34.554
In this department...
in this hospital,

24:34.592 --> 24:37.322
we don't really cure patients.

24:37.361 --> 24:39.022
We just manage them.

24:39.063 --> 24:43.124
It's all about budgets
and box ticking.

24:43.167 --> 24:45.135
Advancement is denied.

24:45.169 --> 24:47.933
Ambition is scorned.

24:47.972 --> 24:50.167
I read your research paper

24:50.207 --> 24:54.371
on the transplantation
of neural progenitor cells in TBI cases.

24:56.580 --> 24:59.378
I'd like to observe this case,
if you'll allow me.

24:59.416 --> 25:02.715
Well, you can observe if you
want to, but it won't be for long.

25:02.753 --> 25:04.846
No relatives have
come forward,

25:04.889 --> 25:06.914
and prognosis
hasn't improved,

25:06.957 --> 25:09.425
and he's out of insurance.

25:09.460 --> 25:12.657
You're talking about
terminating life support.

25:12.696 --> 25:14.687
Well, once AVR tests
have been concurred,

25:14.732 --> 25:16.791
yes, that's exactly
what we're going to do.

25:28.812 --> 25:31.007
Hey, Cat.

25:31.048 --> 25:34.040
Stegman missed you
on rounds.

25:34.084 --> 25:36.245
You can have
my notes if you want.

25:37.621 --> 25:40.784
Hey, what's up?

25:42.793 --> 25:44.818
They're switching
Kenneth off tomorrow.

25:44.862 --> 25:48.195
- Thank Christ.
- Jesus, Sean. What is it with you?

25:48.232 --> 25:50.223
- What?
- Too much, Sean.

25:50.267 --> 25:53.259
- You okay?
- I don't know, Kim.

25:53.304 --> 25:55.431
Wait a second. "They"?

25:55.472 --> 25:57.838
Have you talked
to someone about this?

25:57.875 --> 26:01.174
- We should have helped him.
- Hey hey.

26:01.211 --> 26:03.975
Hey hey hey, Cat.

26:04.014 --> 26:06.505
You're right, okay?

26:06.550 --> 26:09.178
We should have.
But look at us.

26:09.219 --> 26:12.017
Think about the people
we can help...

26:12.056 --> 26:14.456
for years to come.

26:14.491 --> 26:17.426
You're going
to be a great doctor.

26:18.462 --> 26:21.863
That is something, huh?
That's really something.

26:22.900 --> 26:24.333
Yeah.

28:11.075 --> 28:15.239
Dr. Stegman, I've been researching
the latest round of drug trials.

28:15.279 --> 28:17.509
I would be interested
in hearing your thoughts.

28:20.150 --> 28:23.745
Organ rejection
and neural regeneration drugs

28:23.787 --> 28:26.153
combine to help stimulate
dead mitochondria.

28:28.092 --> 28:31.255
These combinations are
in early stages of lengthy testing.

28:31.295 --> 28:34.560
I don't think they're gonna come up
in the exam anytime soon, Cat.

28:35.599 --> 28:38.432
Hypothetically, though,
I mean, these are existing drugs

28:38.469 --> 28:41.438
that could help stimulate
coma patients, correct?

28:41.472 --> 28:44.635
One day, perhaps.

28:44.675 --> 28:47.235
This strictly isn't my field,
you understand?

28:47.277 --> 28:49.643
Talk to Dr. Harris.

28:49.680 --> 28:52.615
I'd still like your opinion.

28:52.649 --> 28:55.641
Close your eyes.

28:55.686 --> 28:58.086
Go on, close your eyes.

28:58.122 --> 29:01.683
Imagine you're looking up
at a clear night sky.

29:01.725 --> 29:03.886
What you see is nothing...

29:03.927 --> 29:07.021
a few thousand stars
visible to the naked eye,

29:07.064 --> 29:10.500
a mere fraction
of 100 billion stars

29:10.534 --> 29:13.196
that make up our galaxy.
The point is

29:13.237 --> 29:16.502
there are more
neural connections in your brain

29:16.540 --> 29:20.704
than there are stars in the whole
of our small corner of the universe.

29:20.744 --> 29:22.871
You start putting
these both these drugs

29:22.913 --> 29:25.609
into something
so incredibly complex,

29:25.649 --> 29:29.915
well, we have to be very
very careful.

29:34.224 --> 29:36.624
Catherine...

29:36.660 --> 29:38.821
you don't seem your usual self.

29:38.862 --> 29:41.626
I will be.

29:41.665 --> 29:43.599
Thank you, Doctor.

30:26.910 --> 30:29.310
Hi.

30:29.346 --> 30:31.746
- Shelby?
- Yeah.

30:31.782 --> 30:34.649
- Hi, I'm Catherine.
- Hi.

30:34.685 --> 30:37.848
Um, Dr. Stegman has me
running vitals on a new patient.

30:37.888 --> 30:40.379
A Kenneth...

30:40.424 --> 30:43.484
- Uh, Kenneth Chisholm?
- Yes.

30:43.527 --> 30:44.721
Has Harris okayed this?

30:44.761 --> 30:48.458
Unfortunately. It means
I'll be in and out of here all night.

30:48.498 --> 30:50.159
Well, he's all yours.

30:50.200 --> 30:53.363
Oh, wait.
You've gotta give this guy a call,

30:53.403 --> 30:55.303
a Detective Carter.

30:55.339 --> 30:57.637
Just in case Kenneth gets
any visitors, okay?

30:57.674 --> 31:00.199
Don't worry. He won't.
I mean, none of them do.

31:00.244 --> 31:01.802
Right.

31:01.845 --> 31:04.541
Thanks.

31:42.286 --> 31:44.652
Harris having a party?

31:44.688 --> 31:46.679
I'm just the messenger.

31:46.723 --> 31:50.124
I'll have it ready in a few.

31:58.835 --> 32:01.235
Gotta love those sexy texts.

32:03.140 --> 32:06.473
Listen, if you wanna
take five, I'll be fine here.

32:06.510 --> 32:08.637
Yeah? You sure?

32:08.679 --> 32:10.306
Mm-hmm.

32:13.951 --> 32:15.714
I won't be long.

33:40.070 --> 33:43.039
Come on.

33:43.073 --> 33:45.234
Don't do this to me, Kenneth.

33:50.847 --> 33:52.610
Third floor.

33:52.649 --> 33:54.310
Come on.

34:26.083 --> 34:28.210
- Bye.
- Bye.

36:23.800 --> 36:24.994
Safe home.

36:25.035 --> 36:27.595
Hey, Cat.

36:27.637 --> 36:29.798
Hey, Cat, wait.

36:32.375 --> 36:35.173
Cat, hey, I've been looking
for you everywhere.

36:35.212 --> 36:37.578
- Where have you been?
- Not now, Yoshimi, okay?

36:37.614 --> 36:39.047
Look, just hear me out, Cat.

36:39.082 --> 36:41.516
Please, look,
all I knew was textbooks

36:41.551 --> 36:43.542
and printouts
and stupid dummies.

36:43.587 --> 36:46.886
Seeing him like that...
I couldn't handle it.

36:46.923 --> 36:49.653
You tried to help him that night
and I just stood there.

36:49.693 --> 36:51.558
It turns out
I couldn't help him either.

37:41.645 --> 37:44.170
It is over, Yoshimi, okay?

37:44.214 --> 37:47.445
I tried to help him
and it's just not gonna happen.

37:47.484 --> 37:50.419
Just move on.

37:50.453 --> 37:53.183
But, Catherine, I'm sorry.

38:17.047 --> 38:19.515
What are you doing?!

38:19.549 --> 38:22.017
Stop it!

39:17.674 --> 39:20.541
So did you notice anything
different about him lately?

39:23.780 --> 39:26.374
I mean...

39:26.416 --> 39:28.748
we walked by him
every single night.

39:28.785 --> 39:31.811
"Safe home."

39:33.690 --> 39:35.681
And that's it.

39:35.725 --> 39:38.990
So you didn't know of any problem
he might have had with your friend.

39:39.028 --> 39:41.223
No no.

39:41.264 --> 39:43.255
Hmm.

39:43.299 --> 39:46.063
He says he doesn't remember a thing.

39:46.102 --> 39:49.094
Last thing he knew,
he had a nosebleed,

39:49.139 --> 39:51.073
and woke up to this.

39:53.877 --> 39:57.677
Just... how could he do it?

39:57.714 --> 40:00.649
You never know what's
going on in people's heads.

40:00.683 --> 40:02.548
He seemed like a regular guy.

40:02.585 --> 40:05.577
Then this.

40:05.622 --> 40:07.817
Well, here's my card,

40:07.857 --> 40:10.951
if you need
to get in touch.

40:10.994 --> 40:13.895
Detective Carter, thank you.

40:13.930 --> 40:15.625
Call any time.

40:31.881 --> 40:34.042
She was gone
before I could even...

40:34.083 --> 40:36.608
Cat, you couldn't
have stopped him.

40:36.653 --> 40:38.780
No way.

40:38.822 --> 40:40.756
Thank you for walking me.

40:42.525 --> 40:44.493
Listen, you sure
you don't wanna...

40:44.527 --> 40:46.927
talk?

40:46.963 --> 40:49.955
- Or something?
- No, I'm fine. Really.

40:49.999 --> 40:52.160
- Yeah.
- I just need to sleep.

40:54.571 --> 40:57.096
I'm gonna be there tomorrow
when they turn him off.

40:57.140 --> 40:59.904
Whoa, you're not
going to work tomorrow.

40:59.943 --> 41:01.274
No way.

41:01.311 --> 41:03.802
Somebody should be there.

41:03.847 --> 41:06.372
Yeah, well, that someone
doesn't have to be you.

41:08.818 --> 41:11.218
You gotta let it go.

41:11.254 --> 41:14.485
Cat, you can't help
him anymore.

41:14.524 --> 41:16.082
Okay?

41:16.125 --> 41:17.888
You gotta look after yourself.

41:20.463 --> 41:23.193
Stop torturing yourself.

41:23.233 --> 41:26.532
Maybe you were right, Jake.

41:28.505 --> 41:30.996
Maybe if I do my job

41:31.040 --> 41:33.440
better than I ever
have before,

41:33.476 --> 41:37.537
then I can look
at myself again.

41:39.716 --> 41:41.707
No, wait.

41:43.286 --> 41:46.050
Listen, I gotta go
to Hopkins... find a pad.

41:47.390 --> 41:49.085
Okay.

41:49.125 --> 41:52.458
Why don't you come with me?

41:53.696 --> 41:55.493
We could get away,

41:55.532 --> 41:57.864
take some time out.

41:57.901 --> 42:00.768
I can't.

42:00.803 --> 42:03.897
I'm sorry.
I wanna be there tomorrow.

42:15.451 --> 42:17.043
Hi, Cat.

42:33.202 --> 42:36.330
Dr. Harris, has there been
a change in his condition?

42:36.372 --> 42:39.170
The patient showed
sporadic brain activity in the night.

42:39.208 --> 42:41.642
Probably the result
of faulty equipment.

42:41.678 --> 42:44.078
It's happened before.
It'll happen again.

42:45.882 --> 42:48.851
But he might not
actually be brain-dead.

42:48.885 --> 42:52.013
I shall monitor him
for one more night.

42:53.022 --> 42:54.649
Protocol.

43:08.104 --> 43:10.504
Doors opening.

43:10.540 --> 43:12.633
Ground floor.

43:15.511 --> 43:18.207
Doors closing.

43:18.247 --> 43:20.477
Doors opening.

43:22.118 --> 43:25.849
- Something on your mind?
- Doors closing.

43:25.888 --> 43:29.346
For some reason, you can't
give this Kenneth thing up,

43:29.392 --> 43:32.327
but my life isn't getting trashed

43:32.362 --> 43:34.296
because of
Sleeping-Fucking-Ugly.

43:34.330 --> 43:36.525
Yoshimi was murdered
last night, Sean.

43:36.566 --> 43:38.500
But she didn't have
anything on you,

43:38.534 --> 43:40.434
so it doesn't even register,
does it?

43:40.470 --> 43:42.529
I'm telling you
what does register.

43:42.572 --> 43:44.665
That cop who busted Walt...

43:44.707 --> 43:47.437
he's the same cop they sent
when Kenneth was admitted.

43:47.477 --> 43:50.173
I know. I have his card.
You want me to call him?

43:50.213 --> 43:54.172
Cute.

43:54.217 --> 43:57.209
I want you to realize we're
all way past bouts of conscience.

43:57.253 --> 44:01.349
Let them pull the plugs
and let it go.

44:01.391 --> 44:03.552
- Doors opening.
- You're a real piece of work.

44:03.593 --> 44:06.562
- Have a nice day.
- Ninth floor.

44:55.945 --> 44:59.005
Okay, Kenneth,
work with me tonight.

44:59.048 --> 45:01.073
No surprises, huh?

45:01.117 --> 45:03.347
I'm trying to help you.

45:40.757 --> 45:42.486
Shelby?

45:45.027 --> 45:46.858
Shelby, I need you to see this.

46:13.589 --> 46:16.422
Shelby?

46:16.459 --> 46:18.825
Down here all alone?

46:18.861 --> 46:21.193
Naughty.

46:21.230 --> 46:24.722
Very naughty.

46:24.767 --> 46:26.667
What's with the blood?

46:29.472 --> 46:31.599
Are you sick, Nurse?

46:31.641 --> 46:34.166
Wanna play games?

46:34.210 --> 46:37.077
Why don't we step
into my office, honey,

46:37.113 --> 46:40.139
and take a closer
look at that?

46:40.183 --> 46:43.448
How long have we got?

46:46.956 --> 46:48.287
Lots of good shit around.

46:48.324 --> 46:51.657
Just gotta know
where to look.

47:20.056 --> 47:22.047
I get it.

47:22.091 --> 47:24.116
You're the boss.

47:39.075 --> 47:41.236
Come on, baby.

47:41.277 --> 47:43.541
What you got?

47:49.952 --> 47:51.510
Kinky.

47:51.554 --> 47:53.351
I like.

49:47.803 --> 49:51.705
Freakdog.

50:35.918 --> 50:37.909
If you see him,
we're just trying to find him.

50:37.953 --> 50:40.114
They found him
in the storeroom.

50:40.156 --> 50:42.556
Half his fucking
head was melted.

50:42.591 --> 50:43.717
I'm scared.

50:43.759 --> 50:45.784
One thing has got
nothing to do with the other.

50:45.828 --> 50:47.625
What if this has something
to do with Kenneth?

50:47.663 --> 50:48.857
Wanna say his name louder?

50:48.898 --> 50:50.832
Don't think the cops
in the next precinct heard you.

50:50.866 --> 50:53.061
You might want to ease
off the hooch a little, Kim.

50:53.102 --> 50:55.400
- Screw you, Steve.
- Look, I'm sorry, okay?

50:55.438 --> 50:57.804
But we don't wanna lose it.

50:57.840 --> 51:00.502
We weren't the only people
Sean partied with.

51:00.543 --> 51:02.738
- He kept bad company.
- What about Yoshimi?

51:02.778 --> 51:04.712
She never did anything wrong.

51:04.747 --> 51:06.772
There isn't any mystery there.
We know who killed Yoshimi.

51:06.816 --> 51:08.408
Yeah, but what
do you mean, Kim?

51:08.451 --> 51:12.182
I'm just saying
what if somebody knew,

51:12.221 --> 51:14.485
and they're punishing us?

51:14.523 --> 51:16.616
- Like who?
- I don't know.

51:16.659 --> 51:19.127
Until a few days ago, they were
ready to turn off his machines

51:19.161 --> 51:21.152
because nobody gave a rat's ass.
And what now?

51:21.197 --> 51:23.256
Out of the blue
he's got some kind of avenging angel?

51:23.299 --> 51:25.358
Christ, Kim,
give me a fucking break.

51:25.401 --> 51:27.266
All right, that's enough.

51:27.303 --> 51:29.601
This isn't helping, okay?

51:29.638 --> 51:31.936
It's weird
and it's all screwed up,

51:31.974 --> 51:34.340
but it is not connected.

51:34.376 --> 51:36.139
Hey, Kim, maybe it's
Creepy Kenny:

51:36.178 --> 51:38.408
the all-singing, all-dancing,
all-sleepwalking,

51:38.447 --> 51:40.677
coma killing vegetable.

51:40.716 --> 51:42.513
How about that, princess?

51:44.520 --> 51:47.546
You know what?

51:48.691 --> 51:50.818
Maybe I'm next.

51:50.860 --> 51:53.351
I'll work on being worried.

52:15.217 --> 52:16.582
Your thoughts?

52:21.157 --> 52:23.489
An increase in pulse between...

52:23.526 --> 52:25.824
Look at the brain activity.

52:25.861 --> 52:27.829
Heightened electrical activity.

52:27.863 --> 52:30.229
- Where?
- Angular gyrus.

52:30.266 --> 52:31.494
Which does what?

52:31.534 --> 52:34.697
It's located in the vestibular area
of the cerebral cortex,

52:34.737 --> 52:36.568
so we think
it helps link visual input

52:36.605 --> 52:39.073
to the brain's touch and balance
representation of the body.

52:39.108 --> 52:41.201
Very good.
What else?

52:41.243 --> 52:43.040
Uh...

52:45.714 --> 52:48.478
Subjects who undergo
electrical stimulus to this region

52:48.517 --> 52:50.314
claim to leave their own bodies.

52:50.352 --> 52:53.913
They attribute this to the paranormal.
Out-of-body experience.

52:55.824 --> 52:59.282
It's utter nonsense.
Their perception is simply altered.

52:59.328 --> 53:01.421
The body sensors
transmitting information

53:01.463 --> 53:04.227
to a region of the brain...

53:06.335 --> 53:09.964
We have here a patient
who is spontaneously

53:10.005 --> 53:12.098
peaking in this region.

53:12.141 --> 53:14.939
Not just electrical spikes.

53:16.712 --> 53:19.681
It seems Mr. Chisholm has
more life in him than we thought.

53:19.715 --> 53:20.977
I think an MRI scan...

53:21.016 --> 53:23.780
Prior electrical activity 105.

53:23.819 --> 53:26.583
It stabilized at 130.

53:33.963 --> 53:36.158
- I'm sorry. I have to go.
- Are you all right?

53:36.198 --> 53:38.723
I'm sorry, I have to go.

54:21.277 --> 54:24.212
I need to know
what happened that night.

54:24.246 --> 54:27.875
I saw the security tape...

54:27.916 --> 54:30.942
what I did.

54:33.789 --> 54:35.654
Once you see,

54:35.691 --> 54:38.216
you can't unsee.

54:38.260 --> 54:41.127
- Forget about the tape.
- I can't.

54:41.163 --> 54:42.892
Tell me what you remember.

54:42.931 --> 54:46.367
You spoke to me, Walt.

54:46.402 --> 54:49.667
Do you remember
what you said?

54:49.705 --> 54:52.970
What I always say:

54:53.008 --> 54:55.602
"Safe home."

54:57.946 --> 55:00.141
"Safe home" to the ladies;

55:00.182 --> 55:01.979
"Be good" to the boys.

55:02.017 --> 55:05.851
Safe home. Be good.

55:05.888 --> 55:07.856
And after that?

55:07.890 --> 55:10.859
I don't remember.

55:10.893 --> 55:14.090
You can't remember anything
that happened after we spoke?

55:16.065 --> 55:17.657
Blood.

55:19.168 --> 55:21.159
You had a nosebleed.

55:21.203 --> 55:23.603
Yeah.

55:23.639 --> 55:25.903
Can you remember
anything else?

55:25.941 --> 55:27.806
Nothing else.

55:27.843 --> 55:29.674
No more.

55:32.648 --> 55:35.583
I'd like to go back
to my room now.

55:35.617 --> 55:37.107
Come on, pal.

55:37.152 --> 55:40.588
You killed her, Walt, and you
can't remember anything else?

55:43.926 --> 55:45.689
Freakdog.

55:48.063 --> 55:50.361
What did you say?

55:53.068 --> 55:56.231
Walt, what did you
say to me?!

55:56.271 --> 55:58.933
Walt, what did you say?!

55:58.974 --> 56:02.307
Freakdog.

56:07.116 --> 56:09.277
Freakdog.

56:10.486 --> 56:12.283
- Fucking freakdog.
- Freakdog.

56:12.321 --> 56:14.983
Freakdog, Freakdog, Freakdog!

56:16.892 --> 56:19.326
I need to get out!

57:12.714 --> 57:14.807
Your methods are deplorable,

57:14.850 --> 57:18.513
but ultimately
this breakthrough could prove

57:18.554 --> 57:20.613
very beneficial to you,

57:20.656 --> 57:24.183
to this hospital, and also
to Kenneth and other patients like him.

57:24.226 --> 57:26.524
- I've made a terrible mistake.
- Yes, you have,

57:26.562 --> 57:29.156
but I shall be taking over
Kenneth's treatment from now on,

57:29.198 --> 57:31.325
and I shall take the credit
for the breakthrough.

57:31.366 --> 57:35.029
We'll both keep quiet
about your unethical behavior

57:35.070 --> 57:37.800
- and you still get to become a doctor.
- Nope.

57:37.840 --> 57:40.070
- You don't understand.
- On the contrary.

57:40.108 --> 57:42.633
Something quite
extraordinary is happening.

57:42.678 --> 57:44.976
Something groundbreaking.
I can smell it.

57:45.013 --> 57:47.811
Dr. Harris, something
terrible is happening.

57:47.850 --> 57:50.876
Out of body. It is real.
It is happening. We have to stop...

57:50.919 --> 57:52.682
No, you stop.

57:52.721 --> 57:55.656
I've been stepped over in this place
more times than I care to imagine,

57:55.691 --> 57:58.023
and I will not be stepped over
by a fucking student.

57:58.060 --> 58:00.051
We have to stop
injecting treatment now!

58:00.095 --> 58:02.063
He's my patient... mine.
Do you understand?

58:02.097 --> 58:04.565
Go. Everything's fine.
Everything is under control.

58:04.600 --> 58:07.433
No, you can't control him!

58:11.740 --> 58:14.538
Doors closing.

58:18.146 --> 58:20.774
Oh shit.

58:31.960 --> 58:33.894
- Stop!
- What the fuck was that for?

58:33.929 --> 58:35.396
Yeah!
- I'm sorry.

58:35.430 --> 58:37.864
Anyone gonna hit dick-for-brains,
it's me. Got that?

58:37.900 --> 58:40.198
- Oh, sorry. I thought that he was...
- I'll tell you who he is.

58:40.235 --> 58:42.294
He's a no-good lying shitbag.

58:42.337 --> 58:44.202
- Cat?
- Jake.

58:44.239 --> 58:46.400
Oh, thank God.

58:46.441 --> 58:49.069
What's going on?

58:49.111 --> 58:51.773
- It's Kenneth.
- Kenneth?

58:51.813 --> 58:54.907
- What are you talking about?
- I tried to fix things,

58:54.950 --> 58:56.577
and I made them
so much worse.

58:56.618 --> 58:59.143
- It all went wrong.
- What went wrong?

58:59.187 --> 59:02.953
I injected him
with a Phase I drug

59:02.991 --> 59:05.152
that I thought could
help his condition.

59:05.193 --> 59:08.629
He killed them.

59:08.664 --> 59:11.963
Kenneth's in a coma.

59:14.436 --> 59:16.734
Oh, Cat, it's the pressure.

59:16.772 --> 59:18.899
We've all been
under a lot of stress.

59:18.941 --> 59:20.841
No, it's happening.

59:20.876 --> 59:23.845
Look, he has the ability

59:23.879 --> 59:26.404
to take people, to use them.

59:26.448 --> 59:28.848
The drugs I gave him are
making his brainwaves peak.

59:28.884 --> 59:30.579
They're causing
some sort of a...

59:30.619 --> 59:33.349
Hey, look at me, Cat.
You're talking crazy, all right?

59:33.388 --> 59:35.379
- No!
- This doesn't make any kind of sense.

59:35.424 --> 59:38.086
The peaks are a result
of heightened electrical activity

59:38.126 --> 59:39.650
in the angular gyrus.

59:39.695 --> 59:43.495
That part of the brain is directly
linked to out-of-body experience.

59:43.532 --> 59:45.830
This peak happened
at the exact same time

59:45.867 --> 59:48.563
that Sean had a funnel
rammed down his mouth.

59:48.604 --> 59:50.629
A goddamn funnel.

59:50.672 --> 59:55.371
So Kenneth's somehow
taking over people's bodies

59:55.410 --> 59:57.935
and killing us one at a time?

59:59.915 --> 01:00:02.042
Have I got that right?

01:00:05.654 --> 01:00:07.645
Yes.

01:00:07.689 --> 01:00:09.953
You know what, Cat?

01:00:09.992 --> 01:00:12.426
I'm... I'm gonna get
you some sedatives.

01:00:12.461 --> 01:00:14.224
Jake!

01:00:14.262 --> 01:00:15.889
He's not gonna stop.

01:00:15.931 --> 01:00:17.899
He's gonna kill us all...

01:00:17.933 --> 01:00:21.460
you, Kim, me, Steve, Harriet.

01:00:21.503 --> 01:00:23.471
He is gonna get us, Jake,

01:00:23.505 --> 01:00:25.473
for what we did to him.

01:00:30.812 --> 01:00:33.406
- You don't believe me. Okay.
- Well...

01:00:33.448 --> 01:00:35.712
Come on.

01:00:35.751 --> 01:00:39.414
Do me a favor
and lock your door.

01:00:39.454 --> 01:00:41.081
And don't let anyone in.

01:00:58.573 --> 01:01:01.542
Harriet!

01:01:03.612 --> 01:01:06.479
Harriet!
Come on.

01:01:06.515 --> 01:01:08.608
Harriet, open the door!

01:01:11.019 --> 01:01:13.214
Oh, God.

01:01:18.593 --> 01:01:21.153
Oh my God.

01:01:21.196 --> 01:01:23.721
What happened?

01:01:46.121 --> 01:01:49.682
Oh, shit.
Cat, come on.

01:01:53.428 --> 01:01:56.261
Cat, I'm sorry.
Okay?

01:01:59.901 --> 01:02:01.198
What?

01:02:01.236 --> 01:02:03.295
Get Steve and his family.

01:02:03.338 --> 01:02:06.796
Find Kim. Check the malls,
the clubs. Just find her.

01:02:06.842 --> 01:02:09.208
Maybe if you guys
get far enough away,

01:02:09.244 --> 01:02:12.338
- he won't be able to hurt you.
- You should come too.

01:02:12.380 --> 01:02:14.871
No, I have to stop him.

01:04:10.932 --> 01:04:13.059
Help me.

01:04:14.736 --> 01:04:17.796
Please, somebody.

01:04:21.309 --> 01:04:23.903
No.

01:04:55.010 --> 01:04:57.478
No.

01:05:11.192 --> 01:05:14.684
Freakdog.

01:05:24.172 --> 01:05:26.333
Help me!

01:05:43.892 --> 01:05:47.123
Freakdog.

01:05:47.162 --> 01:05:50.359
Vanessa?

01:06:23.131 --> 01:06:25.122
Vanessa?

01:06:29.137 --> 01:06:31.435
Jesus, Vanessa,
what are you doing?

01:06:31.473 --> 01:06:33.703
Vanessa.

01:06:38.813 --> 01:06:41.247
Vanessa, you're
sleepwalking, baby.

01:06:42.751 --> 01:06:44.514
Hey, come on.
Don't be afraid.

01:06:44.552 --> 01:06:48.010
Turn around. It's me.

01:06:48.056 --> 01:06:49.683
Hey, don't be afraid.

01:06:49.724 --> 01:06:52.921
Come on. Come on.

01:07:33.501 --> 01:07:36.698
Oh, come on.

01:07:36.738 --> 01:07:39.832
Come on, Jake.
Come on, please.

01:07:39.874 --> 01:07:42.365
- Hi, this is Jake. I'm not available...
- Shit.

01:07:51.653 --> 01:07:53.280
Fuck.

01:07:55.757 --> 01:07:57.987
Jesus, girl.
Get yourself together.

01:08:23.283 --> 01:08:26.412
- Catherine?
- Kim. Oh, thank God.

01:08:26.453 --> 01:08:28.011
Okay, where are you?

01:08:28.055 --> 01:08:31.252
I'm... I'm...
I'm at the bar.

01:08:31.292 --> 01:08:33.453
Okay, Kim, you have
to listen to me.

01:08:33.495 --> 01:08:36.191
You have to get away from people.
Do you hear me?

01:08:36.231 --> 01:08:38.426
If their nose is bleeding,

01:08:38.466 --> 01:08:40.832
it's really Kenneth.

01:08:40.868 --> 01:08:43.702
Do you understand me?
It's really Kenneth.

01:08:49.544 --> 01:08:52.377
Kenneth, Kenneth.

01:08:55.283 --> 01:08:57.751
Kenneth, you leave her alone.

01:08:59.354 --> 01:09:03.120
Kenneth, Kenneth!
Don't you fucking hurt her!

01:11:16.057 --> 01:11:18.719
Kim, Kim.

01:11:22.530 --> 01:11:25.397
Get an ambulance. Now!

01:11:40.915 --> 01:11:43.179
No.

01:11:43.217 --> 01:11:45.685
Freakdog, die.

01:11:45.720 --> 01:11:49.212
No no!

01:11:49.257 --> 01:11:52.454
Freakdog.

01:11:52.493 --> 01:11:54.256
No!

01:12:04.906 --> 01:12:07.033
Kenneth...

01:12:07.075 --> 01:12:10.340
please, don't do this.

01:12:14.315 --> 01:12:16.875
No no.

01:12:32.867 --> 01:12:34.835
Out of the way, please.

01:12:37.238 --> 01:12:38.762
What have you got?

01:12:38.806 --> 01:12:42.037
We've got possible
pulmonary lacerations,

01:12:42.076 --> 01:12:44.704
massive internal bleeding,
weak pulse.

01:12:44.746 --> 01:12:47.374
Kim, I'm not gonna lose you.

01:12:53.287 --> 01:12:55.517
- Ms. Thomas, I'm arresting you.
- What?

01:12:55.556 --> 01:12:57.387
- Come over here, please.
- No, you can't.

01:12:57.425 --> 01:12:58.517
- Put your hands against the car.
- I need to be with her.

01:12:59.861 --> 01:13:01.294
Why am I here?

01:13:07.602 --> 01:13:09.593
How are my friends?

01:13:09.670 --> 01:13:13.436
All right, that's enough.

01:13:13.474 --> 01:13:16.409
You need to start getting
your head straight, Catherine.

01:13:16.444 --> 01:13:18.776
You're in a world of shit.

01:13:18.813 --> 01:13:20.974
I need to know the truth.

01:13:21.015 --> 01:13:24.951
- I've already told you the truth.
- Tell me again...

01:13:26.354 --> 01:13:28.288
everything.

01:13:29.991 --> 01:13:33.518
We had a party.

01:13:33.561 --> 01:13:37.759
Got ourselves Adderall,
Vicodin, you name it.

01:13:40.501 --> 01:13:42.867
Kenneth Chisholm showed up.

01:13:44.639 --> 01:13:46.630
So we gave him
the booze and the drugs.

01:13:46.674 --> 01:13:50.633
We thought if he was
taking them too,

01:13:50.678 --> 01:13:52.839
then he couldn't tell on us.

01:13:56.417 --> 01:13:59.318
But it didn't happen that way.

01:13:59.353 --> 01:14:01.412
He seized and we panicked.

01:14:03.691 --> 01:14:05.454
And we dropped
him at the ER.

01:14:07.628 --> 01:14:10.495
So you injected him

01:14:10.531 --> 01:14:14.058
with some kind
of wonder drug.

01:14:15.436 --> 01:14:17.631
Yes.

01:14:17.672 --> 01:14:20.573
To try to make up
for what you did?

01:14:20.608 --> 01:14:23.736
In the beginning, yes.

01:14:23.778 --> 01:14:26.246
But now the hospital
thinks it's working,

01:14:26.280 --> 01:14:29.078
- so they're pumping him with this...
- And Kenneth...

01:14:29.116 --> 01:14:32.381
he, what, he possesses people?

01:14:32.420 --> 01:14:34.650
He infects them.

01:14:35.990 --> 01:14:39.357
He takes them and he kills.

01:14:43.431 --> 01:14:46.958
And then he returns to his body
and they don't remember anything.

01:14:49.237 --> 01:14:51.330
From his coma, he does this?

01:14:51.372 --> 01:14:54.705
Look, he is doing this, okay?

01:14:54.742 --> 01:14:57.905
- He is doing all of this.
- Kenneth?

01:14:57.945 --> 01:15:00.675
Yes, Kenneth.

01:15:00.715 --> 01:15:03.980
Coma Kenneth.

01:15:12.493 --> 01:15:16.452
Just what exactly do you think
I can do with any of that?

01:15:22.069 --> 01:15:24.003
I'll tell you what you can do.

01:15:28.109 --> 01:15:31.636
You can go down
to that hospital

01:15:31.679 --> 01:15:35.115
and you can put a bullet
in that sick fucker's head.

01:15:37.151 --> 01:15:39.119
Or give me a gun
and I'll do it.

01:15:39.153 --> 01:15:42.350
You'd do that?

01:15:44.992 --> 01:15:46.892
In a heartbeat.

01:16:02.476 --> 01:16:05.809
- What is this?
- Watch.

01:16:07.014 --> 01:16:09.744
He got a text, see?

01:16:09.784 --> 01:16:12.446
Telling him to meet...

01:16:13.621 --> 01:16:17.284
meet someone he trusted.

01:16:17.325 --> 01:16:19.793
Jake.

01:16:19.827 --> 01:16:23.126
Yeah, Jake.

01:16:29.070 --> 01:16:31.971
No.

01:16:32.006 --> 01:16:35.464
- No!
- You slaughtered him, Catherine!

01:16:35.509 --> 01:16:38.137
- It wasn't me!
- Not Kenneth.

01:16:38.179 --> 01:16:40.943
Not the goddamn bogeyman.
You!

01:16:43.517 --> 01:16:45.849
So no more bullshit.

01:16:51.993 --> 01:16:53.927
You need help, Catherine.

01:17:47.848 --> 01:17:50.146
Excuse me, can I help you?
- Stay the fuck away.

01:20:19.800 --> 01:20:22.291
F-f-f-freak...

01:20:22.336 --> 01:20:24.634
dog.

01:21:40.414 --> 01:21:43.406
That's enough for today,
okay, Catherine?

01:21:44.952 --> 01:21:48.888
- Vitals?
- All good, Catherine.

01:21:48.923 --> 01:21:50.948
Rest now.

01:21:54.094 --> 01:21:56.756
Can we go again?

01:21:56.797 --> 01:21:59.789
Yep.

01:21:59.833 --> 01:22:02.233
We go again tomorrow

01:22:02.269 --> 01:22:05.329
after you get some rest.
