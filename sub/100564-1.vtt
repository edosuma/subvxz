It's not right and I'm on it.

15:22.095 --> 15:24.010
Secretary: Line four.

15:24.053 --> 15:25.925
-: Would you just tell her I
went into a meeting

15:25.968 --> 15:27.796

[dance music]

15:38.328 --> 15:40.113
-: Oh, I hate working out.

15:40.156 --> 15:42.332
I should be working on marrying
a doctor or a lawyer

15:42.376 --> 15:43.943
and letting myself go.

15:43.986 --> 15:45.205
-: You know what?

15:45.248 --> 15:48.251
You say some of the
craziest things Mindy.

feelings anytime soon.

How can you be happy if you
don't at least try?

16:05.529 --> 16:06.878
-: Buy a jet ski.

16:06.922 --> 16:10.621
Have you ever seen anyone
unhappy riding a jet ski?

16:10.665 --> 16:13.059
Or wait, how about a
trip to Hawaii,

16:13.102 --> 16:14.930
smiling and taking selfies.

16:14.974 --> 16:16.714
Love, it's overrated.

16:18.238 --> 16:19.804
-: Whatever you say.

16:19.848 --> 16:22.329
-: Look, you can go ahead and
get yourself paired okay.

16:22.372 --> 16:25.549
But don't say I didn't warn you.

16:25.593 --> 16:28.117

16:28.161 --> 16:30.119
-: I'm a realist.

16:30.163 --> 16:33.862
-: Well, I would rather
be a dreamer.

16:33.905 --> 16:37.387

01:48:54.310 --> 01:48:56.268
And so are you Lucy.

01:48:56.312 --> 01:48:58.532
-: Dad, she's my friend.

01:48:58.575 --> 01:48:59.663
-: Too bad.

01:48:59.707 --> 01:49:02.579
-: Okay 1 1 2 0 0 Attwater.

01:49:02.623 --> 01:49:03.928
[phone vibrates]

01:49:03.972 --> 01:49:05.713
-: Oh let me see that.

01:49:05.756 --> 01:49:06.583
It's him.

01:49:07.584 --> 01:49:08.585
Hello.

01:49:08.629 --> 01:49:10.369
-: I'm ready for you now.

01:49:10.413 --> 01:49:11.893
-: Yeah you sick fucker.

01:49:11.936 --> 01:49:13.329
-: You really don't understand?

01:49:13.372 --> 01:49:15.026
-: Understand, what is
there to understand?

01:49:15.070 --> 01:49:16.375
-: You don't get it.

01:49:16.419 --> 01:49:18.682
It's not the same reason for
all of them but...

01:49:18.726 --> 01:49:19.814
You know I'd love to tell you

01:49:19.857 --> 01:49:21.946
and your lovely
daughter in person.

01:49:21.990 --> 01:49:23.469
Max: She's not coming.

01:49:23.513 --> 01:49:25.036
-: You sure abut that?

01:49:25.080 --> 01:49:27.648
[Jess screams]

01:49:27.691 --> 01:49:31.608
If I get disappointed, I'll have
to take Jess's life early.

01:49:31.652 --> 01:49:33.392
-: I'll be there.

01:49:33.436 --> 01:49:34.219
Justin: What's that?

01:49:34.263 --> 01:49:36.178
-: I said I'll be there.

01:49:37.135 --> 01:49:38.572
-: 11200 Attwater.

01:49:39.660 --> 01:49:40.574
Come alone.

01:49:42.750 --> 01:49:46.884
If I see anyone else, I'll
kill her right away.

01:49:46.928 --> 01:49:48.451
Do you understand?

01:49:50.235 --> 01:49:51.976
Oh and come unarmed.

01:49:57.155 --> 01:49:58.200
See you soon.

01:49:58.243 --> 01:49:59.157
-: Fuck you.

01:50:01.116 --> 01:50:02.683
Same location you got huh?

01:50:02.726 --> 01:50:03.597
-: Yep.

01:50:04.989 --> 01:50:05.816
-: Oh god.

01:50:06.991 --> 01:50:07.905
Oh alright.

01:50:10.081 --> 01:50:12.083
We better get going huh?

01:50:13.128 --> 01:50:15.870
[thunder cracks]

01:50:22.441 --> 01:50:23.529
-: Stop there.

01:50:29.884 --> 01:50:32.626
Show me that you
have no weapons.

01:50:38.719 --> 01:50:39.545
Her too.

01:50:47.728 --> 01:50:48.554
Well done.

01:50:57.738 --> 01:50:58.608
-: You just let her go.

01:50:58.652 --> 01:51:00.479
-: That's close enough.

01:51:01.567 --> 01:51:03.047
-: Okay.

01:51:03.091 --> 01:51:04.614
-: You're a sick piece of shit.

01:51:04.658 --> 01:51:05.484
-: Shh.

01:51:08.009 --> 01:51:10.315
-: Maybe I'm just awake.

01:51:10.359 --> 01:51:14.102
-: You mean, killing people
makes you feel like
you're awake?

01:51:14.145 --> 01:51:14.798
-: You really don't get it?

01:51:14.842 --> 01:51:16.321
-: No.

01:51:16.365 --> 01:51:18.106
So you feel like you're alive
when you kill somebody?

01:51:18.149 --> 01:51:20.412
No, I never felt like that.

01:51:23.328 --> 01:51:27.376
-: I have seen people when they
can't possibly lie to me.

01:51:28.769 --> 01:51:32.947
I've seen people when they can't
possibly ignore me.

01:51:35.776 --> 01:51:36.820
Okay.

01:51:36.864 --> 01:51:38.604
Like Mindy for instance.

01:51:38.648 --> 01:51:40.998
Treated me like I was nothing.

01:51:42.086 --> 01:51:44.480
Gave herself to me,
body and soul,

01:51:44.523 --> 01:51:46.830
when I made the right promises.

01:51:48.179 --> 01:51:52.183
Or my father for instance, now
that was special.

01:51:54.229 --> 01:51:57.406
I'll never forget the look on
his face when he realized,

01:51:57.449 --> 01:51:58.929
finally he'd lost.

01:52:02.019 --> 01:52:04.848
He'd lost a contest for
once in his life.

01:52:04.892 --> 01:52:08.852
[laughs] It was too me.

01:52:08.896 --> 01:52:10.332
Oh he hated that.

01:52:14.031 --> 01:52:17.165
My mother though, that may
be my favorite,

01:52:18.470 --> 01:52:20.821
because I never knew she had
such a pure soul.

01:52:20.864 --> 01:52:23.214
Honestly, she
couldn't believe it.

01:52:23.258 --> 01:52:26.740
Even as she bled out, and
she faded away

01:52:26.783 --> 01:52:29.743
she never stopped believing
in her baby boy.

01:52:29.786 --> 01:52:31.919
And I'll always have that.

01:52:35.879 --> 01:52:39.448
Honestly the cops I killed, were
mostly just in the way.

01:52:39.491 --> 01:52:41.058
And there was Cody.

01:52:42.364 --> 01:52:46.542
Piece of shit Cody,
right [laughs].

01:52:49.023 --> 01:52:50.764
But honestly, really,

01:52:53.810 --> 01:52:56.682
you can't tell me you've
never felt that.

01:52:56.726 --> 01:52:57.814
-: No, I never did that.

01:52:57.858 --> 01:52:59.685
I kill people who try to
kill me usually.

01:52:59.729 --> 01:53:02.514
Or I kill people that are bad,
like yourself.

01:53:02.558 --> 01:53:04.560
Hey look, Justin, really
just listen to me.

01:53:04.603 --> 01:53:06.605
Hey, snap out of it okay.

01:53:06.649 --> 01:53:08.303
We're on earth.

01:53:08.346 --> 01:53:12.046
This is earth and murder is
against the law

01:53:12.089 --> 01:53:15.005
and you're not gonna get
away with this.

01:53:15.049 --> 01:53:16.006
I mean, you don't think
you're gonna get away,

01:53:16.050 --> 01:53:17.268
I mean you kill the three of us

01:53:17.312 --> 01:53:18.879
and all those other
people you've killed,

01:53:18.922 --> 01:53:21.272
but you don't think you're gonna
get away with this, do you?

01:53:21.316 --> 01:53:22.186
-: What do you even
mean by that?

01:53:22.230 --> 01:53:23.405
It's such a vague term.

01:53:23.448 --> 01:53:25.146
-: You can't be serious.

01:53:25.189 --> 01:53:27.583
-: Oh I'm quite serious.

01:53:27.626 --> 01:53:29.628
-: You know what you are really?

01:53:29.672 --> 01:53:31.848
Fuck all the games here, you
know what you are?

01:53:31.892 --> 01:53:33.676
-: You're the bacillus
of infection.

01:53:33.719 --> 01:53:35.721
And for your low IQ,
small brained ass,

01:53:35.765 --> 01:53:37.811
that means you're the
bottom of the pimple.

01:53:37.854 --> 01:53:39.421
The bacillus of infection,

01:53:39.464 --> 01:53:41.858
you know you've gotta be popped
out for it too heal.

01:53:41.902 --> 01:53:43.599
You're that sick alright.

01:53:43.642 --> 01:53:48.125
And there's nothing special
about that at all, okay.

01:53:48.169 --> 01:53:50.388
And you got a bad haircut on top
of everything else.

01:53:50.432 --> 01:53:51.912
-: To you perhaps.

01:53:51.955 --> 01:53:54.131
In your eyes perhaps, sir.

01:53:55.785 --> 01:53:57.874
But that's because
you're just like me.

01:53:57.918 --> 01:54:00.790
You have the beast inside.

01:54:00.834 --> 01:54:03.358
I've seen the darkness
behind your eyes.

01:54:03.401 --> 01:54:04.228
I know.

01:54:06.143 --> 01:54:08.842
And when I kill you, and I will,

01:54:11.322 --> 01:54:13.498
I'll be complete.

01:54:13.542 --> 01:54:15.370
-: That's some kind of
special baby.

01:54:15.413 --> 01:54:17.415
[laughs] That's some
kind of special.

01:54:17.459 --> 01:54:18.982
-: Yeah.

01:54:19.026 --> 01:54:20.331
But that's enough.

01:54:20.375 --> 01:54:21.202
-: What's that?

01:54:21.245 --> 01:54:23.726
-: Come here or she's dead.

01:54:23.769 --> 01:54:25.206
[Jess sobs]

01:54:25.249 --> 01:54:26.033
-: Okay hang on, hang on.

01:54:26.076 --> 01:54:26.903
Don't, don't, no.

01:54:26.947 --> 01:54:27.861
No, no, no.

01:54:28.687 --> 01:54:30.646
Hey, listen to me.

01:54:30.689 --> 01:54:32.430
Come on, aren't you
enjoying this?

01:54:32.474 --> 01:54:34.824
Seeing me tremble like this
and my daughter?

01:54:34.868 --> 01:54:36.043
It's gotta be fun for you right?

01:54:36.086 --> 01:54:37.522
Look how frightened we are.

01:54:37.566 --> 01:54:38.654
I mean, that's my daughter.

01:54:38.697 --> 01:54:41.396
I would rather die a
thousand deaths

01:54:41.439 --> 01:54:42.832
than her ever be harmed.

01:54:42.876 --> 01:54:44.007
Aren't you getting a
kick out of this?

01:54:44.051 --> 01:54:46.096
So give me a minute here,
alright.

01:54:46.140 --> 01:54:47.706
You got the big bad wolf
really afraid.

01:54:47.750 --> 01:54:49.491
I'm gonna start crying.

01:54:50.666 --> 01:54:52.363
So, get a thrill out of
this alright.

01:54:52.407 --> 01:54:54.148
There's a thrill
murdering right?

01:54:54.191 --> 01:54:56.498
Now, I wanna make you a deal.

01:54:56.541 --> 01:55:01.416
You let these two girls go and
you kill me, okay?

01:55:01.459 --> 01:55:03.418
Okay let's make this
last a long time.

01:55:03.461 --> 01:55:05.376
You kill me really slow,
you know.

01:55:05.420 --> 01:55:07.465
You cut me, you kill me with
papercut's or some shit

01:55:07.509 --> 01:55:10.120
but you let them go and kill me.

01:55:11.948 --> 01:55:13.515
-: You'd do that for me?

01:55:13.558 --> 01:55:14.385
-: Yeah.

01:55:15.996 --> 01:55:16.822
-: Okay.

01:55:18.215 --> 01:55:19.390
Come here.

01:55:19.434 --> 01:55:21.523
[dramatic music]

01:55:21.566 --> 01:55:22.393
-: Um.

01:55:26.223 --> 01:55:27.007
Now!

01:55:27.050 --> 01:55:29.313
[gun pops]

01:55:31.446 --> 01:55:33.578
[Jess sobs]

01:55:33.622 --> 01:55:34.449
Let's go come on.

01:55:34.492 --> 01:55:35.493
-: Oh my god.

01:55:44.415 --> 01:55:45.242
-: Done.

01:55:48.115 --> 01:55:50.378
Hey my sweeties, it's over.

01:55:51.379 --> 01:55:52.902
It's all over.

01:55:52.946 --> 01:55:53.772
It's over.

01:55:55.296 --> 01:55:58.386
Don't look at him,
don't look at him.

01:55:59.430 --> 01:56:02.694
[tense dramatic music]
