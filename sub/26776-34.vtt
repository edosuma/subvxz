20:03.569 --> 20:06.071
Ha! You idiots did nothing.

20:06.138 --> 20:08.407
This device is still live!

20:08.473 --> 20:10.742
- Yeah we know.

20:10.809 --> 20:12.578
- But now we're in
the boom-proof box.

20:12.644 --> 20:15.981
- And you're out there
with the boomsday device.

20:16.048 --> 20:19.084
- We'll see you again,
Frittleman -- when ducks fly!

20:19.151 --> 20:21.286
[ all laugh at Frittleman ]

20:21.353 --> 20:23.589
- Oh. Frittles.

20:29.027 --> 20:31.496
- Okay...so we peed again,
we watched the second number

20:31.563 --> 20:32.864
of "Dog Judge: The Musical"--

20:32.931 --> 20:34.266
♪ Dog! Judge! ♪

20:34.333 --> 20:36.835
♪ You'll never believe
what happened. Woof! ♪

20:36.902 --> 20:38.737
- --looked up pictures of trees
on the Internet,

20:38.804 --> 20:41.239
decided Piper should be
in the suit, peed again,

20:41.306 --> 20:43.675
and fed Chonk the hamster.

20:45.744 --> 20:47.646
Are we ready to go save
Ray and Henry?!

20:47.713 --> 20:48.747
- Yeah!
- Save them!

20:48.814 --> 20:51.049
- This suit smells weird.

20:54.353 --> 20:56.355
- Oh wait! I just remembered
I have homework to do!

20:56.421 --> 20:57.656
- NOOOOO!
- Do it later!

20:57.723 --> 20:59.057
- This is why
you get paid the least.

20:59.124 --> 21:01.026
- Wait -- what?!

21:07.032 --> 21:10.168
- Hey good news.
The hospital just texted me.

21:10.235 --> 21:12.137
They were able to reattach
Jack Frittleman's face.

21:12.204 --> 21:15.707
- Yeah! Quick thinking on your
part to put that face on ice.

21:15.774 --> 21:17.542
- That was actually
Miles and Mika's idea.

21:17.609 --> 21:19.144
- Who?

21:19.211 --> 21:23.815
- The kids who helped us
escape from Frittleman's trap?

21:23.882 --> 21:25.250
{\an8}- Frittle who?
- Are you serious?

21:25.317 --> 21:26.818
{\an8}Are you serious right now?
You know what, whatever.

21:26.885 --> 21:28.453
{\an8}Your brain's broke
but I gotta wazz.

21:28.520 --> 21:30.122
{\an8}- Yeah, me too.
- Welllll I'm gonna go first.

21:30.188 --> 21:31.957
{\an8}- Welllll I'm in charge here.
- Well think I'm gonna--

21:32.024 --> 21:34.593
{\an8}- Don't tug me
I'm holding a duck!
