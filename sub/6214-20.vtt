WEBVTT

00:05.902 --> 00:06.926
I am so sorry.

00:07.103 --> 00:09.333
My assistant will be spoken to
and dealt with.

00:09.505 --> 00:12.030
Gloria, another screw-up like that
and you're out of here.

00:12.208 --> 00:14.335
Oh, boy, here come the tears.
Gotta go.

00:15.111 --> 00:18.444
Wow, I'm beginning to feel sorry
for your imaginary assistant.

00:18.615 --> 00:21.448
Well, she's the one
not doing her imaginary job.

00:21.618 --> 00:22.744
I accidentally sent my editor

00:22.919 --> 00:24.910
the guest list to my wedding
instead of my article,

00:25.088 --> 00:27.352
so now she's mad it's late
and that she wasn't invited.

00:27.523 --> 00:29.320
Oh, poor Sabrina.

00:29.492 --> 00:30.516
How about a pick-me-up?

00:31.294 --> 00:32.921
How about a put-that-down?

00:34.030 --> 00:35.224
Aaron and I promised each other

00:35.398 --> 00:36.956
we'd open our wedding presents
together.

00:37.133 --> 00:40.432
A steam iron and some fresh tape
and he'll be none the wiser.

00:40.603 --> 00:41.695
I'd never do that.

00:41.871 --> 00:44.101
I'd take it to the airport
and have it x-rayed.

00:44.273 --> 00:46.002
Aaron and I have this weird thing
between us.

00:46.175 --> 00:48.473
- Trust?
- Oh, I have one of those.

00:48.645 --> 00:49.669
Mine's offshore.

00:49.846 --> 00:52.246
I haven't paid taxes in years.

00:56.919 --> 00:57.977
Salem, what are you doing?

00:58.154 --> 00:59.178
Inventory.

00:59.355 --> 01:03.553
By the way, about your china pattern,
Colonial floral?

01:03.726 --> 01:05.694
Did you pick it out over the phone?

01:06.062 --> 01:08.360
Oh, I had no idea
you were so interested in China.

01:10.299 --> 01:11.664
Eh?

01:12.935 --> 01:14.630
Oh, man.

01:14.804 --> 01:17.932
It's gonna take me forever
to mark my territory.

01:19.000 --> 01:25.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:58.281 --> 02:00.408
"Roommate Wanted
for Immediate Opening. "

02:00.583 --> 02:01.607
Immediate?

02:01.784 --> 02:03.809
So until the wedding
I sleep in the garage?

02:03.986 --> 02:07.012
Oh, thanks, I was afraid that was
gonna be a tough conversation.

02:07.890 --> 02:10.154
We're not pushing you out,
but you are moving to L.A.

02:10.326 --> 02:12.658
We gotta start making
some sort of plans.

02:12.829 --> 02:14.126
We're gonna miss you so much.

02:14.297 --> 02:15.662
- I'm gonna miss you too.
- Uh-huh.

02:15.832 --> 02:17.766
Can this wait?
Those telephone poles fill up fast.

02:17.934 --> 02:19.401
We won't be long.

02:21.337 --> 02:23.999
You're actually
letting those two dizzy dames live here

02:24.173 --> 02:26.437
after we catch the trolley
to Tinseltown?

02:26.609 --> 02:28.440
Don't worry,
I've got an Other Realm contractor

02:28.611 --> 02:31.011
coming to disconnect the portal,
and your vocal cords.

02:31.180 --> 02:33.705
So there won't be any more
magical surprises popping in.

02:36.719 --> 02:38.243
Like that.

02:41.224 --> 02:42.248
What the...?

02:42.425 --> 02:44.791
I don't think the Other Realm
knew about the wedding.

02:44.961 --> 02:47.259
It's not who knows,
it's what they sent.

02:47.430 --> 02:49.398
And whether it's in my size.

02:49.565 --> 02:50.589
Okay, here goes.

02:50.767 --> 02:52.234
You never know
with Other Realm gifts.

02:52.401 --> 02:53.459
It could be a time machine,

02:53.636 --> 02:55.695
the Eighth Wonder of the World
or corncob holders.

02:56.439 --> 02:57.736
Oh.

02:57.907 --> 03:00.171
I was gonna get you a box.

03:00.343 --> 03:02.641
Yeah,
I think I know where this is going.

03:04.647 --> 03:07.377
I just didn't think
it would take so long to get there.

03:07.550 --> 03:09.040
Oh, just want I always wanted:

03:09.218 --> 03:11.982
- An ice cube.
- An ice cube?

03:12.488 --> 03:13.682
Aunt Irma.

03:16.092 --> 03:20.085
Ooh, these clever entrances
are wreaking havoc on my spine.

03:20.963 --> 03:25.059
Aunt Irma, what a lovely...
What a pleasant... What a surprise.

03:25.234 --> 03:26.258
Well, it shouldn't be.

03:26.435 --> 03:28.027
I believe
you have something to share?

03:28.204 --> 03:29.671
Not really. Let's see.

03:29.839 --> 03:31.534
I switched shampoos.
I got new tires.

03:31.707 --> 03:33.299
- I'm getting married...
- That's the one.

03:33.476 --> 03:35.273
Congratulations. Ha, ha.

03:35.444 --> 03:38.004
Really? You're okay with this?
I mean, no death and destruction?

03:38.181 --> 03:39.443
No plague of scorpions?

03:39.615 --> 03:41.515
Not unless you registered for them.

03:41.684 --> 03:44.915
Now, you know where I stand
on witches marrying mortals.

03:45.087 --> 03:46.679
Usually on their necks.

03:47.924 --> 03:49.915
But, if you insist,

03:50.092 --> 03:53.755
I suppose this Harvey Kinkle
is the least offensive of the lot.

03:53.930 --> 03:55.830
Harvey, Aunt Irma...

03:55.998 --> 03:57.693
Welcome to the family.

03:57.867 --> 04:00.131
- I'm not marrying Harvey.
- What?

04:03.840 --> 04:05.000
I'm okay.

04:05.174 --> 04:07.734
So who is this mystery groom?

04:07.910 --> 04:09.901
Does he come
from a good witch family?

04:10.079 --> 04:12.479
Good, bad, who are we to judge?

04:12.648 --> 04:14.616
He's a witch, isn't he?
Because if he isn't:

04:16.485 --> 04:19.214
Oh, man, and that was the only
wedding present I liked.

04:19.387 --> 04:20.514
Well, I can tell you this,

04:20.690 --> 04:23.716
his mother's a real witch
and his father's a bit of a gnome.

04:23.893 --> 04:25.986
Splendid, I must meet this boy now.

04:26.162 --> 04:29.222
No, Aaron hates being popped in.
I mean, he hates anything pop.

04:29.398 --> 04:32.265
<i>Pop music, popcorn,
he doesn't even like Mary Poppins.</i>

04:32.435 --> 04:34.926
Ha, ha. Who does? Chirpy little twit.

04:35.605 --> 04:37.698
I look forward to meeting him
tonight at dinner.

04:37.874 --> 04:40.069
- Tonight? Kind of late notice.
- Mm-hm.

04:40.243 --> 04:43.474
Sabrina, without my blessing,
there will be no wedding.

04:43.846 --> 04:45.780
Chicken or fish?

04:46.315 --> 04:49.546
You do realize
she thinks Aaron's a witch?

04:49.719 --> 04:51.311
Yeah, that's kind of
what I was going for.

04:51.487 --> 04:53.318
You heard her.
You saw the shards of pottery.

04:53.489 --> 04:55.218
- I had no choice.
- Ha.

04:55.391 --> 04:58.121
Well, at least you don't have to worry
about what's for dinner:

04:58.294 --> 04:59.693
Your butt in a sling.

05:00.263 --> 05:02.390
Well, maybe I'll start with a salad.

05:03.933 --> 05:04.957
Okay, what do you think?

05:05.134 --> 05:07.364
Does this vinaigrette say,
"Please don't kill my fiancé"?

05:07.536 --> 05:10.061
That's a lot of pressure
to put on a salad dressing.

05:10.239 --> 05:13.572
Mm. But, heck, it is tangy.

05:14.043 --> 05:15.943
Okay, all I have to do now
is convince Aunt Irma

05:16.112 --> 05:17.943
to keep believing
that Aaron's a witch

05:18.114 --> 05:19.706
and I'll have her blessing
before dessert.

05:19.882 --> 05:22.009
As long as everything
goes according to plan.

05:22.752 --> 05:23.912
Oh, not according to plan.

05:24.086 --> 05:26.316
- What are you guys doing here?
- Roommate interviews.

05:26.489 --> 05:28.684
We need the table.
It gives us the illusion of power.

05:28.858 --> 05:30.985
Can you give the illusion
of doing it somewhere else?

05:31.160 --> 05:32.855
- You can't stay here.
- Why?

05:33.029 --> 05:35.429
Why? I'll tell you exactly why.

05:35.598 --> 05:36.622
Oh, here's why.

05:36.799 --> 05:38.164
Because people
who respond to flyers

05:38.334 --> 05:39.858
on telephone poles
are total whack-jobs.

05:40.036 --> 05:41.469
You want them knowing
where you live?

05:41.637 --> 05:45.129
Well, they're going to have to know
if they're going to live here.

05:45.308 --> 05:47.367
Right. Why don't we pre-screen them
at the diner?

05:47.543 --> 05:49.704
Good idea. Who cares
if they know where the diner is?

05:49.879 --> 05:51.642
- Even crazy people have to eat.
- I'm hungry.

05:53.015 --> 05:55.074
- Go that way.
- Why can't we use the front door?

05:55.251 --> 05:57.219
Why? I'll tell you exactly why. Later.

05:58.187 --> 05:59.620
I'm coming. I'm coming.

06:01.624 --> 06:04.525
Fresh-picked daisies. Thought they'd
help me get on your aunt's good side.

06:04.694 --> 06:06.423
Yeah, well, she hasn't a good side.

06:06.595 --> 06:09.029
Aunt Irma's a nut. No, correction.

06:09.198 --> 06:11.530
She's a kook. Oh, check that.
She's insane.

06:11.701 --> 06:13.965
Her condition seems to be
deteriorating as we speak.

06:14.136 --> 06:15.831
Yeah, but don't mention that to her.
Uh...

06:16.005 --> 06:19.168
Whatever she says, just embrace it.
Play along, but don't question her.

06:19.342 --> 06:22.573
Ha, ha. Sabrina, calm down.
I'm sure I can handle your aunt.

06:22.745 --> 06:24.736
- By the way, when does she get here?
- Now.

06:24.914 --> 06:26.245
Whoa.

06:26.415 --> 06:28.212
- Where did you come from?
- The Big Dipper.

06:31.587 --> 06:33.111
Oh, I love it there.

06:33.289 --> 06:34.620
It's an armpit.

06:35.925 --> 06:38.120
Do you visit
the outer reaches often?

06:38.294 --> 06:39.659
I feel like I am right now. Ha, ha.

06:39.829 --> 06:41.592
Oh, Aaron loves to travel the galaxy,

06:41.764 --> 06:43.288
although
he's surprisingly down to earth

06:43.466 --> 06:44.763
and plays along really well.

06:44.934 --> 06:45.958
Right, right.

06:46.135 --> 06:48.569
I mean, just last week
I was backpacking on Mars.

06:48.738 --> 06:52.731
Oh, my 16th husband died
in a backpacking accident on Mars.

06:52.908 --> 06:54.967
- Oh, I'm so sorry.
- Oh, don't be.

06:55.144 --> 06:57.942
Fortunately for me,
they were never able to prove a thing.

06:59.582 --> 07:00.913
Okay, well, who's hungry?

07:01.083 --> 07:03.108
Oh, I'm famished.
What's for dinner?

07:03.285 --> 07:06.277
Well, I thought I'd let you choose.
What would you like for dinner?

07:06.455 --> 07:08.116
Oh, don't go to any trouble. I...

07:08.290 --> 07:12.249
Oh, maybe prime rib, horseradish,
creamed spinach, baked potatoes

07:12.428 --> 07:14.555
and hot rolls.

07:14.730 --> 07:16.288
Easy.
And, Aaron, where shall we eat?

07:16.465 --> 07:19.434
In here? Or in there?

07:19.602 --> 07:25.404
Well, I think since it's a special night,
we should eat in there.

07:25.741 --> 07:27.902
Oh, well done.
And I don't mean the meat.

07:28.077 --> 07:29.101
Let's eat. Ha, ha.

07:29.278 --> 07:30.677
Well, shall we?

07:30.846 --> 07:33.906
Oh, what manners. Ha-ha-ha.

07:34.383 --> 07:36.681
Oh. And such manly magic.

07:38.387 --> 07:39.581
Manly?

07:39.755 --> 07:41.882
Well,
I guess I could use a manicure.

07:42.058 --> 07:45.357
I always pay my rent in advance,
and love to cook and clean.

07:45.528 --> 07:48.122
Uh, oh, and my father, he owns
a chain of women's shoe stores.

07:48.297 --> 07:51.130
Oh, I have met Mr. Right
and she is a woman.

07:51.300 --> 07:52.324
When can you move in?

07:52.501 --> 07:54.162
What she means is,
we'll be in touch.

07:55.137 --> 07:57.002
Did I mention
my brother's a fireman?

07:57.173 --> 07:59.664
Swell. You can go now.

08:00.476 --> 08:02.239
I'll call you.

08:02.645 --> 08:04.875
What is your problem?
She's perfect.

08:05.047 --> 08:06.947
Let's just say she's no Sabrina.

08:07.116 --> 08:09.607
Yeah, no Sabrina is why we're here.

08:09.785 --> 08:12.515
If we don't find a roommate,
we are gonna be living on the street.

08:12.688 --> 08:14.417
Oh, maybe we could time-share
a dumpster.

08:14.590 --> 08:17.150
I'm sorry, but no one's ever
gonna compare to Sabrina.

08:17.893 --> 08:19.986
So I have to move out
of the greatest house ever

08:20.162 --> 08:23.063
unless we find someone
who's exactly like Sabrina?

08:23.232 --> 08:24.529
I'm just not gonna settle.

08:24.700 --> 08:27.191
Hey, I hear you guys
are looking for a roommate

08:27.369 --> 08:28.836
and I'm looking for a room.

08:29.004 --> 08:31.802
- So maybe...
- I'm sorry. I don't think so.

08:32.341 --> 08:33.433
Well, your loss.

08:34.809 --> 08:35.902
Gotta go.

08:36.078 --> 08:37.841
Wait, wait, wait.
What did you just say?

08:38.581 --> 08:41.482
I said I gotta go?

08:42.751 --> 08:45.549
Please, they were practically
separated at birth.

08:45.721 --> 08:47.484
So, Betty, huh?

08:47.656 --> 08:49.487
Is that short for "Bettrina"?

08:49.658 --> 08:52.218
Mm. Delicious.

08:52.394 --> 08:55.955
The last decent prime rib I had
was for my 600th birthday.

08:56.132 --> 08:58.862
Oh, Charlemagne
was such a scamp.

09:00.236 --> 09:02.568
Oh, where does the time go?

09:02.738 --> 09:05.036
Oh, you know time. It flies.

09:05.207 --> 09:07.266
When you're off your meds.

09:07.443 --> 09:08.501
I'm sorry.

09:08.677 --> 09:11.043
I can't sit here and listen
to this any longer.

09:11.213 --> 09:15.343
You actually expect me to believe
that you're over 1,000 years old?

09:16.952 --> 09:20.183
Because you, Irma,
don't look a day over 500.

09:20.356 --> 09:21.948
Oh, I like this boy. Ha-ha-ha.

09:22.124 --> 09:24.820
Oh, he's a heart-stopper all right.

09:24.994 --> 09:27.724
- So tell me, what do you fly?
- Fly?

09:27.897 --> 09:30.229
Oh, Aarons a big flyer.
He flies all the time.

09:30.399 --> 09:33.095
You know, kites, flags,
and occasionally off the handle.

09:33.269 --> 09:35.897
And when I have the time,
my vintage Mustang.

09:36.071 --> 09:37.163
Now, she really flies.

09:37.706 --> 09:39.469
Do you wanna see her?
She's right outside.

09:43.212 --> 09:44.873
Oh, lovely.

09:45.047 --> 09:46.810
A classic.

09:51.387 --> 09:54.288
I must say, Sabrina.
You have quite a catch here.

09:54.456 --> 09:56.083
Oh, thank you, Irma.

09:56.258 --> 09:58.783
And you have my blessing.

09:59.195 --> 10:00.890
Woo-hoo! She fell for...

10:01.063 --> 10:02.894
Aaron. Just like I did.

10:03.065 --> 10:04.657
I'll get the pudding.

10:06.802 --> 10:08.429
Well, Salem, you doubting tomcat,

10:08.604 --> 10:12.165
I just got Irma's blessing
to marry my witch fiancé.

10:12.341 --> 10:14.002
Now I can just relax and enjoy...

10:14.176 --> 10:15.370
Oh, no, you guys can't be here.

10:15.544 --> 10:17.375
And yet we are. Sabrina, Betty.

10:17.546 --> 10:20.515
- Bettrina.
- Okay, the name is Betty.

10:20.683 --> 10:21.980
Oh, my gosh.

10:22.151 --> 10:24.312
Seeing the two of you
next to each other,

10:24.486 --> 10:26.078
it's uncanny.

10:26.255 --> 10:28.621
- We're giving her a house tour.
- Fine, great.

10:28.791 --> 10:31.191
Start upstairs and show Betty
every square inch of everything.

10:31.360 --> 10:33.920
You can't make a decision
about a place until you've slept there.

10:34.096 --> 10:36.189
Don't come down
until you've had a good night's sleep.

10:36.365 --> 10:39.892
Whoa, I am having a Mary-Kate
and Ashley moment.

10:40.069 --> 10:42.594
Have you ever thought
about dying your hair blonde?

10:42.771 --> 10:45.831
This better be some room.

10:47.676 --> 10:50.839
Here.
Don't say I never gave you anything.

10:51.814 --> 10:53.679
Looks like we'll have
to call it an early night.

10:53.849 --> 10:55.942
The cat got into the...
Where's Aunt Irma?

10:56.118 --> 10:58.279
Ahh! Did she violate
the immutable laws of physics

10:58.454 --> 11:00.046
and do something
completely inexplicable?

11:00.222 --> 11:01.280
If she did, I can explain.

11:01.724 --> 11:04.158
Maybe you can explain
what he's doing here.

11:04.326 --> 11:05.520
He? He who?

11:05.694 --> 11:06.718
He Harvey.

11:06.895 --> 11:09.887
Your aunt's fawning over him
in the living room.

11:10.065 --> 11:11.896
What you talking about?
Aaron's not a witch.

11:12.067 --> 11:13.125
No, wait, what he means is,

11:13.302 --> 11:15.827
Aaron is not a witch
that you can take lightly.

11:16.005 --> 11:18.803
I mean, he is all-powerful
in his witchy, witchy ways.

11:18.974 --> 11:20.407
Witchy ways?

11:20.576 --> 11:21.975
Yeah, what she said.

11:22.144 --> 11:23.634
You lied to me.

11:23.812 --> 11:24.836
Lied? No.

11:25.014 --> 11:27.448
All I did was deliberately mislead you
at every possible turn.

11:27.616 --> 11:29.948
But in my defense, you did say
that Aaron was quite a catch.

11:30.119 --> 11:32.417
That's true. I did.

11:36.392 --> 11:38.952
And now he's the catch of the day.

11:41.830 --> 11:43.991
We always talked
about a house in the country,

11:44.166 --> 11:46.634
but a little castle in pea gravel
wouldn't not be so bad.

11:46.802 --> 11:49.362
Are you trying to kiss me?
Talk to me?

11:49.538 --> 11:52.939
Or is none of this making sense
because you're a fish?

11:53.108 --> 11:54.132
Aaron, I'm...

11:58.480 --> 12:00.209
Irma, please, be reasonable.

12:00.382 --> 12:03.044
Well, she should know better
than to try to make a fool out of me.

12:05.087 --> 12:07.612
Sabrina, don't worry,
everything's gonna be okay.

12:07.790 --> 12:10.281
Yeah, it will now.
You were standing on my air hose.

12:10.459 --> 12:12.859
- Oops, my bad.
- Yeah. No kidding, your bad.

12:13.028 --> 12:15.189
You're single-handedly destroying
my relationship.

12:15.364 --> 12:16.422
Don't be angry with Harvey.

12:16.598 --> 12:18.156
You have no one to blame
but yourself.

12:18.334 --> 12:20.859
I'm sorry that my choices don't fit
with your view of the world,

12:21.036 --> 12:22.765
but it doesn't give you
the right to do this.

12:22.938 --> 12:26.567
Ha. Sabrina, the one with
the biggest magic makes the rules.

12:26.742 --> 12:30.178
Look, you mean, vindictive crone,
you're not gonna get away with this.

12:30.346 --> 12:33.144
Okay, I'm gonna do whatever it takes
to walk down the aisle with Aaron.

12:33.315 --> 12:34.805
Or swim, as the case may be.

12:36.151 --> 12:38.381
Did she just call me a crone?

12:38.554 --> 12:40.351
Actually, it was vindictive crone.

12:42.057 --> 12:43.490
I'm not helping, am I?

12:44.626 --> 12:46.526
Oh, boy, a goldfish.

12:46.695 --> 12:48.492
- Can I eat him?
- That's Aaron.

12:48.664 --> 12:50.791
So is that a yes or a no?

12:51.333 --> 12:52.994
Sabrina, I am so sorry.

12:53.168 --> 12:55.466
I didn't do it on purpose, I swear.

12:55.637 --> 12:59.596
Besides, you know I always thought
there was something fishy about him.

13:01.543 --> 13:02.703
Sorry.

13:02.878 --> 13:05.972
Well, you want to redeem yourself?
Here, you watch Aaron.

13:06.148 --> 13:07.740
I'm gonna go try to make a man
out of him.

13:08.550 --> 13:10.450
You know what I mean.

13:13.421 --> 13:15.753
Wait. No, you can't go in there.

13:15.924 --> 13:17.824
Oh, well, tour's over.
Thanks for stopping by.

13:17.993 --> 13:20.461
No, no, not over.
That room's perfect for Bettrina.

13:20.629 --> 13:22.358
Please stop calling me that.

13:22.531 --> 13:25.523
Oh, four walls, closet, ceiling,
a window or two. Ha, ha.

13:25.700 --> 13:28.635
But the real excitement is in the cellar.
Why don't you guys show her that?

13:28.804 --> 13:30.328
Don't go in the living room.

13:30.505 --> 13:31.665
Is that my sweater?

13:31.840 --> 13:33.705
Yeah, doesn't it look great on her?

13:36.545 --> 13:40.413
You guys are gonna need name tags
for me to tell you apart.

13:41.750 --> 13:42.910
Is she part of the deal?

13:43.084 --> 13:45.211
It's negotiable.

13:46.655 --> 13:48.885
Spellman family alert. Stop.

13:49.057 --> 13:50.319
Emergency. Stop.

13:50.492 --> 13:52.187
Aunt Irma must be stopped. Stop.

13:52.360 --> 13:54.726
Oh, I gotta stop stopping.

13:54.896 --> 13:57.262
Sabrina, I swear, it wasn't my fault.

13:57.432 --> 13:59.161
It's okay.
I'm sending out a distress call.

13:59.334 --> 14:03.202
No, this new thing that's not my fault,
is also not my fault.

14:03.371 --> 14:05.464
Say hello to Roxie and Morgan.

14:05.640 --> 14:06.834
No.

14:07.008 --> 14:08.305
They startled Aunt Irma.

14:08.476 --> 14:11.001
She doesn't have much
of a safety on that ping finger.

14:11.179 --> 14:12.612
I'll have to add this to the charges

14:12.781 --> 14:14.442
that are presented
to the Witches' Council.

14:14.616 --> 14:16.607
I'm arming myself
with every possible spell.

14:16.785 --> 14:18.582
- Where's Aaron?
- Oh, it's okay.

14:18.753 --> 14:20.448
- Betty's watching him.
- What?

14:20.622 --> 14:22.749
You left a strange woman
and a hungry cat with my fish?

14:22.924 --> 14:25.188
I mean fiancé.

14:26.695 --> 14:28.788
Okay, there he is.

14:28.964 --> 14:30.932
No, that's just a piece of pasta.

14:31.099 --> 14:32.430
Oh, my gosh. What have you done?

14:32.601 --> 14:36.731
Sorry, I thought goldie looked like
he could use a little more water and...

14:36.905 --> 14:39.931
You flushed my fia...
I mean my fish down the drain?

14:40.108 --> 14:41.405
Honey, calm down.

14:41.576 --> 14:43.771
They're 25 cents
at any school carnival.

14:43.945 --> 14:47.403
- Here, watch these.
- Oh, no, I hate cats.

14:47.582 --> 14:48.776
I can't...

14:48.950 --> 14:52.442
Get enough of these
furry little creatures.

14:52.621 --> 14:56.057
Let's see if we can find a box
for you in the garage.

14:56.224 --> 14:58.385
You and I are going fishing.

14:58.660 --> 15:00.821
Hang on, Aaron. I'm coming.

15:00.996 --> 15:03.794
Whoa! I have a whole new respect
for my plumber.

15:04.266 --> 15:06.894
Yuck. That is so disgusting.

15:07.068 --> 15:09.036
Even I wouldn't go down there.
Ha, ha.

15:12.040 --> 15:14.133
Wow, this place is filthy.

15:14.309 --> 15:15.833
I'm calling my city councilman.

15:16.011 --> 15:18.639
I can't believe this.
Most marriages end up in the sewer.

15:18.813 --> 15:20.041
Mine's starting out there.

15:20.215 --> 15:22.911
The lighting
is surprisingly good down here,

15:23.084 --> 15:25.575
which isn't too good.

15:25.754 --> 15:27.221
Why is this so hard?

15:27.389 --> 15:31.120
Sabrina, come on, we've got, like,
50 miles of sewer to cover.

15:31.293 --> 15:32.385
We just started looking.

15:32.560 --> 15:34.357
No, this, me and Aaron.

15:34.529 --> 15:35.860
Why is it so hard?

15:36.031 --> 15:38.625
It seems like the entire universe
is conspiring against us.

15:38.800 --> 15:41.291
I wish everyone would leave us
alone and let us get married.

15:41.469 --> 15:43.994
I'm sorry, I know I haven't made things
any easier.

15:44.172 --> 15:45.696
Harvey, I didn't mean...

15:45.874 --> 15:47.364
I know this has been hard
on you too.

15:47.542 --> 15:50.010
But, ah! Goldfish. That's him.

15:51.379 --> 15:54.542
Oh, it's just an orange sock.

15:54.849 --> 15:56.248
What if I never find him?

15:56.418 --> 15:58.716
Yeah, what if?

16:00.655 --> 16:02.816
- I think I got something.
- Careful.

16:02.991 --> 16:04.583
Give him some play
or he'll snap the line.

16:04.759 --> 16:05.783
- What?
- What?

16:05.961 --> 16:07.986
My dentist has a lot
of fishing magazines.

16:09.097 --> 16:10.189
Okay, reel him in.

16:10.365 --> 16:13.357
Right.
Get ready to hit him with a hammer.

16:13.535 --> 16:16.060
There will be no
hammering of the fish.

16:16.771 --> 16:18.739
Harvey, you found him.

16:18.907 --> 16:20.636
Yeah. Yeah, I did.

16:20.809 --> 16:23.903
Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you.
I don't know what I'd do without you.

16:24.412 --> 16:26.243
I'm sure you'd do just fine.

16:26.414 --> 16:27.506
Wait a minute.

16:27.682 --> 16:32.176
If you've got Aaron,
then what have I got?

16:32.354 --> 16:33.719
Oh, dear.

16:33.888 --> 16:35.879
A long bath coming.

16:36.524 --> 16:38.788
Okay, Aunt Irma,
we're gonna settle this once and for all.

16:38.960 --> 16:40.222
Put down those three kittens.

16:40.395 --> 16:41.657
Three?

16:41.830 --> 16:43.457
Betty. It was inevitable.

16:43.631 --> 16:45.929
Ah, the odds have shifted.

16:46.101 --> 16:47.762
Advantage, cats.

16:48.236 --> 16:50.864
Oh, I see you found
your fishy friend. Ha, ha.

16:51.039 --> 16:54.031
And I'd heard the relationship
had gone down the drain.

16:54.209 --> 16:56.473
Look, I'm gonna ask you
for the last time, and please...

16:56.644 --> 16:58.373
Note the prominent use
of the word, "please. "

16:58.546 --> 17:00.275
Please turn Aaron back into a man.

17:00.448 --> 17:03.747
And I'm telling you for the last time,
I will not let you marry this mortal.

17:03.918 --> 17:05.351
Fine, then you leave me no choice.

17:06.253 --> 17:08.518
What are you doing?

17:10.392 --> 17:12.359
Giving up my magic.

17:12.527 --> 17:14.461
Sabrina, are you sure
you really want to do that?

17:14.628 --> 17:16.790
If this is the only way that Aaron and I
can be married,

17:16.964 --> 17:17.989
yes, it's what I wanna do.

17:18.165 --> 17:20.964
Ha-ha-ha. So you think just because
you've made this sacrifice

17:21.136 --> 17:25.435
I am going to be all boo-hoo
and your beloved will be a biped?

17:25.607 --> 17:26.800
I can live without the boo-hoo,

17:26.974 --> 17:28.636
but you can't object to two mortals
getting married.

17:28.810 --> 17:30.835
Oh, well, guess what. I can and I do.

17:31.012 --> 17:34.140
So you can give up your magic,
stomp your foot, slam your door,

17:34.315 --> 17:35.873
but I am not turning him back.

17:36.051 --> 17:37.882
You are the meanest aunt ever.

17:38.053 --> 17:39.350
It's too late to kiss up to me.

17:39.521 --> 17:40.545
We are not done.

17:40.722 --> 17:43.418
If it takes me the rest of my life,
I am gonna marry this fish... Man.

17:43.591 --> 17:44.888
Oh, I've got to quit doing that.

17:47.462 --> 17:49.225
Irma, why are you doing this?

17:49.397 --> 17:51.024
Hmm. I have my reasons.

17:51.633 --> 17:53.157
Harvey,

17:53.401 --> 17:56.529
how would you like
to be an all-powerful being?

17:57.205 --> 17:59.196
Hey, I work out.

18:00.208 --> 18:04.076
What would you say
if I offered you Sabrina's magic?

18:04.946 --> 18:06.436
Thanks, I'm good.

18:06.614 --> 18:07.876
Oh, come on now, Harvey.

18:08.049 --> 18:14.181
Don't tell me there isn't something
or someone you desire?

18:14.355 --> 18:16.721
Magic can make many things
happen.

18:22.664 --> 18:25.861
Don't worry, I may not have my magic,
but I still know people.

18:26.601 --> 18:29.434
I have to say, you're holding up well
under the circumstances,

18:29.604 --> 18:31.731
and you're really a great swimmer.

18:33.808 --> 18:35.173
Aaron.

18:35.343 --> 18:36.776
- Ahem.
- Ooh.

18:36.945 --> 18:37.969
What's going on?

18:38.146 --> 18:40.444
Uh, well, you fainted.

18:40.615 --> 18:43.209
And your eyes rolled back,
tongue came out. Not pretty.

18:43.384 --> 18:45.648
So you put me in a bathtub
with all my clothes on?

18:45.820 --> 18:47.287
You would have done
the same for me.

18:47.455 --> 18:50.015
Here. Dry off.

18:50.191 --> 18:51.681
I'll be back.

18:55.830 --> 18:58.128
Aunt Irma, I don't know
what made you change your mind,

18:58.299 --> 19:00.062
but thank you
for turning him back into a man.

19:00.235 --> 19:02.703
Well, obviously
that boy loves you very much.

19:02.871 --> 19:04.930
He really does,
and if you'll just give him a chance,

19:05.106 --> 19:06.368
you'll see why I love Aaron too.

19:06.541 --> 19:09.476
Aaron? I was talking about Harvey.

19:09.644 --> 19:12.738
I gave him the powers
of the universe.

19:12.914 --> 19:14.506
Well, your magic, actually.

19:14.682 --> 19:16.616
Wait, so Harvey
changed Aaron back?

19:16.784 --> 19:17.910
Why couldn't I do that?

19:18.086 --> 19:19.986
You were trying to undue my spell.

19:20.155 --> 19:21.554
He was trying to make you happy.

19:21.723 --> 19:24.556
Turns out
his was a much more powerful motive.

19:24.726 --> 19:26.091
Can't believe he did that for me.

19:26.261 --> 19:27.853
Oh, so marry a mortal.

19:28.029 --> 19:29.690
Don't expect to see me
at your wedding.

19:29.864 --> 19:31.297
Oh, so this does
have a happy ending.

19:32.267 --> 19:33.291
Bye, Aunt Irma.

19:33.468 --> 19:36.266
Oh, wait,
what about our three furry friends?

19:39.007 --> 19:42.443
Oh, fine.
I'll just write off the entire day.

19:44.946 --> 19:45.970
Whoa.

19:46.147 --> 19:47.705
What's going on?

19:47.882 --> 19:49.110
What are we doing?

19:49.284 --> 19:52.219
I don't know, but you two are freaks.

19:52.887 --> 19:54.650
Guys, if Aaron comes
slogging down the stairs,

19:54.822 --> 19:55.914
tell him I'll be right back.

19:56.090 --> 19:58.285
I've got a big thank-you to deliver.

19:58.459 --> 20:01.087
I can't believe that I thought
you were anything like Sabrina.

20:01.262 --> 20:03.127
What are you,
some kind of a sorceress?

20:03.298 --> 20:04.458
Ha, ha. Yeah.

20:04.632 --> 20:06.930
Watch me disappear.

20:08.203 --> 20:10.398
I am so sorry, Roxie.
You know, you were right.

20:10.572 --> 20:12.631
We are never gonna find anyone
to replace Sabrina.

20:12.807 --> 20:14.069
I told you.

20:14.242 --> 20:15.266
And for some reason,

20:15.443 --> 20:18.173
I feel like drowning my sorrows
in a bowl of cream.

20:18.680 --> 20:21.615
I'm more in a raw tuna
kind of mood.

20:24.886 --> 20:25.978
Harvey, it's me.

20:26.487 --> 20:28.580
I just want to thank you.

20:32.760 --> 20:34.250
Harvey?

20:36.097 --> 20:37.724
Harvey?

20:58.453 --> 21:00.819
<i>May your life be filled with happiness</i>

21:00.989 --> 21:03.753
<i>and with the magic
only you can create.</i>

21:03.925 --> 21:07.053
<i>I'll always love you. Harvey.</i>

21:09.497 --> 21:10.521
Goodbye, Harvey.

21:16.971 --> 21:19.906
- I can't believe Harvey's really gone.
- Neither can I.

21:20.074 --> 21:21.598
Oh, it's just tragic.

21:21.776 --> 21:22.970
He was a great guy.

21:23.144 --> 21:24.304
I know, we were so close.

21:24.479 --> 21:25.503
Tell me about it.

21:25.680 --> 21:27.807
We could have had him moved
in here by the weekend.

21:27.982 --> 21:30.712
It wouldn't have worked anyway.
He never would've worn the sweater.

21:30.885 --> 21:32.045
Oh, good point.
