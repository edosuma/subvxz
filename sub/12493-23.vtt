WEBVTT

00:03.792 --> 00:04.834
- Hi, Ivy.
- Ivy: Hey.

00:04.917 --> 00:08.917
- Hi, G.G.
- Uh, Lana, I know you're new here,

00:09.000 --> 00:10.375
but my name is Teddy.

00:10.750 --> 00:14.041
Ohm I'm sorry. I've just heard
so many people call you "G.G.,"

00:14.125 --> 00:15.667
- I thought--
- No, it's Teddy.

00:16.041 --> 00:18.542
Got it. Teddy. Starts with a "T."

00:19.000 --> 00:19.959
Just like touchy.

00:22.500 --> 00:24.333
Ivy, why are people calling me gigi?

00:24.417 --> 00:26.125
I don't know. Maybe it's a nickname.

00:27.667 --> 00:30.625
What-- Are they saying gigi
like the name "gigi"

00:30.709 --> 00:32.125
or the letters "G.G."?

00:32.208 --> 00:33.875
I don't know. Probably the second one.

00:35.375 --> 00:38.750
What would G.G. Stand for? Glamorous Gal.

00:39.208 --> 00:40.583
Golden Goddess.

00:41.083 --> 00:42.750
Genetic Greatness.

00:43.583 --> 00:46.500
Goody-goody. It means goody-goody.

00:48.125 --> 00:50.250
Wha-- Goody-goody--
Why would they call me that?

00:50.375 --> 00:52.250
Maybe it's because you always play
by the rules

00:52.375 --> 00:53.792
and never do anything bad.

00:55.709 --> 00:56.959
Or something like that.

00:57.417 --> 00:59.792
Uh, okay, but I am so not a goody-goody.

00:59.875 --> 01:02.333
If anything, I am a baddy-baddy.

01:03.041 --> 01:06.250
T, only a goody-goody
would say baddy-baddy.

01:06.917 --> 01:09.000
I've been bad. I've broken rules.

01:09.083 --> 01:10.792
- Like when?
- Like the time--

01:12.166 --> 01:14.291
- Okay, I've bent rules.
- Like when?

01:14.375 --> 01:15.542
Like the time a--

01:17.041 --> 01:17.959
Oh, man.

01:19.125 --> 01:20.583
I am a G.G.

01:20.667 --> 01:23.709
I'm glad you came around, girl.

01:23.834 --> 01:25.083

Oh, Gabe, I need your help.

02:24.250 --> 02:26.542
So I just found out
I have this horrible nickname.

02:26.625 --> 02:27.875
You mean G.G.?

02:29.291 --> 02:32.041
- How do you know about that?
- Oh, I helped Ivy come up with it.

02:33.041 --> 02:34.750
Okay, well, I'm not a goody-goody

02:34.834 --> 02:36.792
and I wanna do something
naughty to prove it.

02:36.875 --> 02:38.875
First, stop using words like naughty.

02:39.166 --> 02:40.083
Got it.

02:40.750 --> 02:44.166
Now, I'll help you be bad,
but you gotta help me with something.

02:44.500 --> 02:46.792
- What?
- Well, I'm grounded,

02:46.875 --> 02:49.333
but I need to get ungrounded by Saturday.

02:49.375 --> 02:51.166
Jake invited me to Super Adventure Land.

02:51.250 --> 02:52.750
Super adventure land reopened?

02:53.125 --> 02:55.959
Yeah, that's why I gotta get there
before they close it down again.

02:56.834 --> 02:58.834
Now, how do I get mom
and dad to let me go?

02:59.250 --> 03:02.166
Well, you could try behaving better.

03:02.250 --> 03:04.750
All right, I don't have time for jokes.
I need answers.

03:05.458 --> 03:07.834
Why don't you just do something nice
for them?

03:07.917 --> 03:09.625
- Like?
- Well,

03:10.166 --> 03:12.250
okay, I was in the garage last week

03:12.417 --> 03:15.041
and I found this old poem that dad wrote
to mom back in high school.

03:15.625 --> 03:17.500
I was gonna give it to her
for her birthday,

03:17.583 --> 03:19.083
but you could do it now.

03:19.166 --> 03:22.125
Huh, then they'll be putty in my hands.

03:22.208 --> 03:24.625
- Thanks, G.G.
- Stop calling me that.

03:30.500 --> 03:32.750
- Hi, Charlie.
- Hi, G.G.

03:32.834 --> 03:36.250
Argh!

03:37.917 --> 03:40.166
Mom, will you make me a dress?

03:45.041 --> 03:46.959
PJ, do we need to talk?

03:48.458 --> 03:49.458
About what?

03:51.458 --> 03:53.667
About why you want me to make you a dress.

03:55.542 --> 03:57.709
I don't want you to. I need you to.

03:57.792 --> 04:01.125
Honey, can't you just borrow one of mine?

04:01.208 --> 04:02.542
This could just be a phase.

04:05.250 --> 04:06.917
The dress isn't for me.

04:07.250 --> 04:08.583
It's for Charlie.

04:09.166 --> 04:11.583
I got an assignment in my Home EC class
to make an outfit

04:11.667 --> 04:12.917
for someone in my family.

04:13.583 --> 04:15.917
Okay, next time lead with that.

04:18.375 --> 04:21.667
- So, will you do it?
- Nope, if I do it, how will you learn?

04:21.750 --> 04:25.583
Mom, I took this class to meet girls,
not to learn stuff.

04:27.041 --> 04:30.375
It's my third year taking Home EC,
and I still don't know what "EC" means.

04:31.375 --> 04:32.834
Sorry, kiddo. You're on your own.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.250
Fine. Well, then will you help me
with my Civil War report?

04:35.417 --> 04:36.417
Nope.

04:36.875 --> 04:39.166
Will you at least tell me who won?

04:45.542 --> 04:47.834
I've got a daring new plan

04:47.917 --> 04:51.208
that's gonna blow away
my goody-goody image forever.

04:51.625 --> 04:52.583
Are you ready for this?

04:53.542 --> 04:57.208
- Tomorrow, I say we ditch school.
- Okay.

04:58.583 --> 05:01.083
Ivy, I don't think you understand
what I'm proposing here.

05:01.166 --> 05:04.875
I'm saying tomorrow
we're not going to be in school

05:05.500 --> 05:07.333
when school is going on.

05:09.125 --> 05:12.417
T, I'm familiar
with the concept of ditching.

05:13.375 --> 05:14.625
So, where are we going?

05:14.834 --> 05:17.709
- Super Adventure Land.
- I'm in.

05:19.709 --> 05:21.709
Okay, Ivy, it's settled.

05:22.375 --> 05:24.542
We are going to ditch school tomorrow.

05:25.875 --> 05:29.333
That's right.
Tomorrow, Teddy, Ivy ditching.

05:31.000 --> 05:36.250
And by ditching, I mean gone. Not here.

05:36.792 --> 05:38.542
Absent sans excuse.

05:39.417 --> 05:41.542
We got it, Teddy. You're ditching.

05:42.208 --> 05:44.709
Yeah, by tomorrow I'm gonna have
a new nickname.

05:45.583 --> 05:46.917
Gone girl.

05:48.375 --> 05:49.917
That's still G.G.

05:50.000 --> 05:51.250
Agggghh!

05:56.083 --> 05:58.583
Okay, Charlie,
I'm gonna design a dress for you.

05:58.667 --> 06:02.375
Now don't worry. I just watched 10 hours
of fashion reality shows.

06:02.458 --> 06:03.917
So I'm highly qualified.

06:04.500 --> 06:07.750
Now, let's start by taking a look
at what you usually wear.

06:08.125 --> 06:10.792
Okay, no.

06:11.709 --> 06:12.542
Wrong.

06:14.083 --> 06:17.291
Hate it. Girlfriend,
what are you thinking?

06:17.375 --> 06:19.250
Owls are so last year.

06:21.250 --> 06:23.583
Honey, we need to create
a whole new look for you,

06:23.667 --> 06:25.542
something that screams Charlie!

06:27.250 --> 06:28.959
Oh, sorry I screamed "Charlie."

06:31.959 --> 06:35.041
If I'm gonna make you the perfect dress,
I need to know more about you.

06:35.125 --> 06:36.333
So tell me what you like.

06:36.583 --> 06:38.125
I like toys.

06:38.208 --> 06:40.291
Toys. Fun.

06:40.709 --> 06:42.709
Youth. I'm getting something.

06:43.166 --> 06:47.333
Wait a second. Yes. Yes!

06:48.625 --> 06:49.875
That's your new look.

06:51.083 --> 06:52.000
No.

06:53.959 --> 06:56.542
You are such a diva. I love it.

07:01.959 --> 07:07.834
Mom, Dad, I was feeling so bad
about whatever I did to get grounded.

07:08.542 --> 07:10.250
- Gabe: That--
- You sprayed Mrs. Dabney

07:10.375 --> 07:11.583
with a garden hose.

07:13.709 --> 07:14.834
It was an accident.

07:14.917 --> 07:16.500
She was in her kitchen.

07:18.792 --> 07:23.917
Anyway, I felt so bad about that,
that I decided to clean the garage

07:24.000 --> 07:25.834
and I found this in one
of mom's little boxes

07:25.917 --> 07:27.875
- and framed it for you.
- What is it?

07:27.959 --> 07:30.792
Oh, it's a love poem Dad wrote
to Mom in high school.

07:30.875 --> 07:32.000
- Listen to this,
- No, no, no.

07:32.083 --> 07:33.917
- You don't have to read it, Gabe.
- "My dearest Amy,

07:34.000 --> 07:35.792
how does a dream leave footprints
in the sand?

07:35.875 --> 07:39.959
How does a flower kindle a memory
or candlelight whisper your name?"

07:40.625 --> 07:42.375
Pretty good so far, huh?

07:42.500 --> 07:45.625
Pretty good? I'm a plate of soup.

07:47.834 --> 07:49.250
I don't remember writing that.

07:50.125 --> 07:52.250
It doesn't even rhyme
like a good poem should.

07:54.250 --> 07:56.250
Look at that.
That's not even my handwriting.

07:56.458 --> 07:59.417
Dad, you wrote it. It's signed "Bob D."
Who else would "Bob D." Be?

07:59.500 --> 08:01.083
Diddlebock.

08:01.166 --> 08:02.875
Hey, Dad, watch the language.

08:05.250 --> 08:09.834
Why would Bob Diddlebock
write you a love poem?

08:10.750 --> 08:14.458
Okay, during that brief time
in high school

08:14.542 --> 08:15.834
when we were broken up,

08:15.917 --> 08:18.083
I dated Bob Diddlebock.
It was no big deal.

08:18.166 --> 08:20.041
Not to Bob Diddlebock.

08:21.834 --> 08:26.333
You were a dream that left footprints
in his sand.

08:30.458 --> 08:31.834
I do have that effect on men.

08:33.125 --> 08:38.583
Whoa, whoa! So the minute we break up,
you go out and find another guy?

08:38.667 --> 08:41.250
What was I supposed to do?
Go home and cry all day?

08:41.333 --> 08:42.500
I did.

08:44.166 --> 08:46.834
Bob, it's been 20 years. Let it go.

08:46.917 --> 08:48.792
Oh, like you let the poem go?

08:48.875 --> 08:50.375
We were on a break.

08:50.458 --> 08:53.166
- How about we take another one?
- Works for me.

08:56.333 --> 09:00.667
Guys, this was supposed to be
a happy moment...

09:01.250 --> 09:02.500
for me!

09:09.500 --> 09:14.417
Oh! School's just starting.
First period is happening right now.

09:14.500 --> 09:17.542
Aah, congratulations, T.
You're officially ditching.

09:17.625 --> 09:20.208
- How does it feel to be bad?
- Great.

09:21.834 --> 09:23.291
Does your stomach hurt as much as mine?

09:24.667 --> 09:26.917
Howdy, young ladies!

09:27.000 --> 09:29.959
I'm the mayor of Super Adventure Land.

09:30.041 --> 09:32.792
- Who are you?
- I'm Ivy.

09:34.166 --> 09:36.917
Uh... I'm Claudette.

09:39.208 --> 09:41.500
I'm from Oklahoma.
My parents aren't here right now.

09:41.583 --> 09:44.375
They're taking my brothers
Rusty and Dusty to the bathroom.

09:45.834 --> 09:49.709
Well, that's a little more information
than I needed, darling.

09:53.041 --> 09:55.125
What is wrong with you, Claudette?

09:55.875 --> 09:57.667
I'm new at this, okay?

10:00.333 --> 10:03.000
A cop is staring at us.
He totally knows we're ditching.

10:03.083 --> 10:05.917
T, will you stop?
He doesn't care about us.

10:06.166 --> 10:07.750
Then why is he coming over here?

10:07.834 --> 10:09.750
Just be cool. Nobody's in trouble.

10:10.959 --> 10:13.792
Young ladies, you're under arrest.

10:21.458 --> 10:22.709
We're under arrest?

10:22.792 --> 10:24.542
- Afraid so.
- For what?

10:24.750 --> 10:27.458
For not having enough fun.

10:28.583 --> 10:32.583
And as sheriff of Super Adventure Land,
I'm gonna have to give you a ticket.

10:33.500 --> 10:37.000
For a free smoothie.

10:37.875 --> 10:40.709
Now can we please go have some fun?

10:40.792 --> 10:43.750
I wanna ride terror in the sky.

10:45.041 --> 10:48.792
Really? 'Cause I was thinking
Mr. Chipmunk's kooky clown cars.

10:50.834 --> 10:52.667
Yeah, I'm gonna go find Rusty and Dusty.

10:59.583 --> 11:03.041
Dad, check out this old photo album
I found in the garage.

11:03.125 --> 11:04.959
You stay out of the garage.

11:06.375 --> 11:07.834
It's full of misery.

11:09.375 --> 11:11.750
Let's look at all the great times
you and Mom have had.

11:12.542 --> 11:15.625
Hey, there's you and Mom
and some handsome guy at the prom.

11:15.917 --> 11:17.166
That's Bob Diddlebock.

11:20.542 --> 11:21.792
Moving on.

11:23.125 --> 11:25.583
Hey, where'd mom get
that really cool sports car?

11:26.041 --> 11:27.417
That's Bob Diddlebock's.

11:29.375 --> 11:30.792
He had two.

11:32.875 --> 11:34.709
All right, let's try one more.

11:36.750 --> 11:38.875
Any chance you had a boat...

11:39.500 --> 11:41.125
called the S.S. Diddlebock?

11:47.041 --> 11:47.959
You know,

11:49.250 --> 11:51.834
I just can't believe she kept his poem
all these years.

11:53.250 --> 11:56.208
Anyway, thanks for cheering me up, Gabe.

12:00.208 --> 12:02.083
Handsome, smart and rich.

12:02.959 --> 12:04.834
Oh, Amy, how did you let him get away?

12:09.000 --> 12:10.166
Hey, mom.

12:10.250 --> 12:12.917
You know what would be a really cool thing
to do before Saturday?

12:13.000 --> 12:13.959
What's that?

12:14.041 --> 12:16.375
Rip up Bob Diddlebock's poem
in front of Dad.

12:16.458 --> 12:17.959
Show him it means nothing to you.

12:18.041 --> 12:19.875
Gabe, I'm not gonna do that.

12:20.750 --> 12:21.834
Why?

12:23.750 --> 12:25.500
Because you still have feelings for him?

12:25.917 --> 12:28.458
So, now you're lurking in the kitchen?

12:28.959 --> 12:31.083
Hey, I am always in the kitchen.

12:31.333 --> 12:33.917
I just happened to be lurking
this one time.

12:35.333 --> 12:36.583
You just answer the question.

12:37.000 --> 12:40.166
No, I do not have feelings
for Bob Diddlebock.

12:40.250 --> 12:42.750
Then why did you keep
his stupid poem all these years?

12:42.834 --> 12:46.083
Because it's the only love poem
anyone ever wrote me. That's why.

12:49.000 --> 12:51.625
Oh, yeah? Well, that's-- That's--

12:51.709 --> 12:54.917
That's a pretty good reason.

12:57.458 --> 12:59.959
Man, now I just feel bad.

13:00.041 --> 13:02.458
You know,
the best way to get over feeling bad

13:02.542 --> 13:04.166
is to make someone else feel good.

13:05.000 --> 13:06.500
I can be that someone.

13:09.709 --> 13:10.875
No? Okay.

13:18.750 --> 13:20.166
So, where should we go next?

13:20.750 --> 13:23.709
Say cheese!

13:23.792 --> 13:26.834
Have a super day! Hoo-hoo!

13:26.917 --> 13:29.834
- Ivy, did you see that?
- See what?

13:29.917 --> 13:33.500
Who wants to take a picture with me?
Step right up.

13:33.583 --> 13:35.291
Hey, I saw what you did!

13:35.667 --> 13:36.917
You stole that woman's wallet.

13:37.291 --> 13:39.834
I don't know what you're talking about.
Toodle-oo!

13:40.458 --> 13:41.625
Hey, come back here.

13:46.291 --> 13:49.750
What in tarnation is going on here?

13:49.834 --> 13:52.709
The mayor, he's a thief.
He stole a woman's wallet.

13:52.792 --> 13:54.250
- What?
- Careful, bill.

13:54.291 --> 13:57.083
She's been acting up all day.
Might be a Code 6.

13:57.166 --> 13:59.333
- Let's go.
- Wait a minute.

13:59.792 --> 14:01.208
What's a code 6?

14:01.500 --> 14:03.834
Possible wacko!

14:12.583 --> 14:14.083
Why isn't Charlie in preschool?

14:14.166 --> 14:16.291
I had to pull her out. We have work to do.

14:17.542 --> 14:18.709
Why aren't you in school?

14:18.792 --> 14:20.834
Charlie's dress isn't done,
and I'm on a deadline.

14:21.291 --> 14:23.166
Okay, are any of my kids in school?

14:23.834 --> 14:25.792
Oh, at least I know Teddy is.

14:26.291 --> 14:28.917
Mom, I'm freaking out.
Would you mind taking a look at my dress?

14:29.166 --> 14:30.333
Sure, let's see what you got.

14:36.875 --> 14:39.917
It's all Charlie's fault.
She's not selling it.

14:40.250 --> 14:41.917
Honey, don't blame the model.

14:42.000 --> 14:45.125
I said be fierce. Is that fierce?

14:45.208 --> 14:46.750
I don't know.

14:47.792 --> 14:51.583
No, you don't, do you?
This-- This is a disaster.

14:56.000 --> 14:59.208
Ivy, you gotta get me out of here.
I am not cut out for the slammer.

15:01.208 --> 15:03.709
Don't worry. I've got this.

15:03.792 --> 15:04.875
Okay.

15:08.417 --> 15:09.458
Howdy, Sheriff.

15:11.834 --> 15:12.792
Whoops.

15:14.959 --> 15:16.959
Sheriff, I think you dropped
200 fun bucks there.

15:17.625 --> 15:18.917
Are you trying to bribe me?

15:20.041 --> 15:21.166
Maybe I am.

15:21.250 --> 15:23.917
With pink money
that has absolutely no monetary value?

15:27.166 --> 15:29.917
Sheriff. Oh, I'm on my way.

15:30.792 --> 15:33.500
Well, it's your lucky day.
We're understaffed.

15:33.583 --> 15:35.250
- We just got a code 12.
- What's that?

15:35.375 --> 15:37.709
Some kid just barfed on the tilt-a-whirl.

15:38.458 --> 15:39.834
Now you're free to go.

15:39.917 --> 15:41.250
Oh, thank goodness.

15:48.875 --> 15:51.125
PJ, we're waiting.

15:51.750 --> 15:52.750
All right.

15:55.500 --> 15:56.875
Say hello...

15:59.125 --> 16:00.291
to Charlie.

16:01.083 --> 16:04.000
Her kicky summer dress is perfect
for the 2-year-old

16:04.083 --> 16:06.417
who plays all day and parties all night.

16:07.375 --> 16:10.917
From nap time to snack time,
this dress says it all.

16:11.000 --> 16:15.375
And if there's an oopsie with a juice box,
no problem. It's washable.

16:16.500 --> 16:19.458
I have to say I am impressed.

16:20.125 --> 16:22.041
Clean lines, nice stitching.

16:22.542 --> 16:25.792
- Excellent job.
- Thank you and thank you, Charlie.

16:26.291 --> 16:28.000
- Yeah.
- Charlie:

16:28.834 --> 16:30.500
Is that a price tag?

16:33.917 --> 16:35.917
All right, "B" minus.

16:36.041 --> 16:41.709
Really? Oh, because buying the dress
is a creative way to solve the problem?

16:42.083 --> 16:45.750
No, because this is your third time
in my class.

16:45.917 --> 16:47.250
We're done.

16:53.333 --> 16:56.834
Hello! Can I borrow someone's notes?

16:57.333 --> 17:01.000
Sorry, I don't know if you guys noticed.
I wasn't here yesterday.

17:01.083 --> 17:02.792
That's right. Ditching.

17:03.500 --> 17:05.250
Yeah, you told us that.

17:05.333 --> 17:07.000
We went to Super Adventure Land,

17:07.083 --> 17:10.750
had a bit of a run-in with the cops,
ended up in jail.

17:13.291 --> 17:14.917
T, look.

17:16.500 --> 17:17.750
What is he doing here?

17:17.834 --> 17:19.917
Teddy Duncan,
would you come up here, please?

17:20.000 --> 17:22.333
All:

17:24.375 --> 17:27.834
Hello, I am the sheriff
of Super Adventure Land.

17:28.125 --> 17:30.041
And because of this young lady,

17:30.375 --> 17:35.333
we uncovered a ring of pickpockets
that sadly included our own mayor,

17:35.417 --> 17:38.750
the town crier and yes, Sal the squirrel.

17:40.500 --> 17:44.208
And now on behalf of Super Adventure Land,

17:44.291 --> 17:47.834
and our parent company,
Famfunco Industries, North America,

17:48.375 --> 17:51.750
I'm proud to present
this super citizen medal

17:51.834 --> 17:53.500
to Teddy Duncan.

17:53.583 --> 17:56.834
I'm not a super citizen.
I'm a ditcher. I'm bad.

17:58.000 --> 17:59.875
Well, whatever you are,

18:00.000 --> 18:03.625
thank you for saving
good wholesome clean family fun.

18:07.250 --> 18:09.208
G.G.! G.G.!

18:09.417 --> 18:11.083
Guys, I'm bad!

18:11.417 --> 18:13.458
I'm bad I tell you!

18:13.542 --> 18:15.667
G.G.! G.G.!

18:15.750 --> 18:17.750
- All: G.G.! G.G.!
- What the heck?

18:17.834 --> 18:19.750
All: G.G.! G.G.!

18:23.542 --> 18:25.542
Hey, Amy, you got a minute?

18:26.417 --> 18:28.583
- What is it, Bob?
- Something I want you to hear.

18:29.208 --> 18:32.083
Okay, I wrote this for you.

18:33.542 --> 18:35.542
"To my wonderful wife,

18:36.375 --> 18:40.458
the love of my life,
here is a poem from your Bobby-boo.

18:43.792 --> 18:46.917
I love your sweet hugs
even more than my bugs.

18:47.291 --> 18:50.375
And your kisses more than chili or stew."

18:52.375 --> 18:53.750
You do love your stew.

18:54.500 --> 18:57.500
Okay, okay, here, there's more.
There's more. Okay.

18:57.583 --> 19:01.417
"And though our future's unwritten,
I still remain smitten

19:02.083 --> 19:04.458
and will till the end of all time.

19:05.583 --> 19:09.000
This poem may be late.
I know it's not great,

19:09.834 --> 19:12.792
but at least I know how to rhyme."

19:16.875 --> 19:20.125
That's very sweet. Thank you, Bobby-boo.

19:23.709 --> 19:26.417
Eww. I mean, what's going on?

19:27.750 --> 19:32.250
- I have a new poem for my frame.
- Yes, and it rhymes.

19:32.667 --> 19:36.375
Oh, you guys made up.
That's just fantastic.

19:36.667 --> 19:38.667
You know, we should celebrate.

19:39.125 --> 19:40.834
How about a trip to Super Adventure Land?

19:41.125 --> 19:43.166
Hey, yeah, why not?
We haven't been there in a while.

19:43.250 --> 19:45.333
- Yeah, sounds good to me.
- Yes!

19:46.667 --> 19:48.125
Hey, PJ, guess what.

19:48.208 --> 19:50.208
The whole family's
going to Super Adventure Land.

19:50.291 --> 19:52.166
Oh, didn't you hear?

19:52.250 --> 19:55.667
There's a big scandal involving the mayor.
Super adventure land's closed.

19:56.083 --> 20:00.291
No!

20:03.917 --> 20:06.250
Well, Charlie,
mom and dad found out I ditched

20:06.333 --> 20:07.625
and now I'm grounded.

20:08.250 --> 20:09.709
It's called consequences.

20:10.208 --> 20:12.792
Something you get used to
when you're a baddy-baddy.

20:14.458 --> 20:16.542
Darn, I'm still wearing the medal.

20:19.250 --> 20:23.000
Teddy, what are you doing?
No video diary while you're grounded.

20:23.959 --> 20:27.125
No video diary while I'm grounded?
That seems kind of lame.

20:27.750 --> 20:30.792
I don't know how else to punish you.
You don't really do anything.

20:33.750 --> 20:37.250
So, you don't think I'm bad?
Mom, I'm, I'm bad.

20:37.333 --> 20:40.166
I'm so bad I'm not even
gonna say good luck, Charlie.

20:40.250 --> 20:41.959
- You just did.
- Oh!

20:46.959 --> 20:49.709
Announcer: The story you have just seen
is true.

20:49.792 --> 20:53.083
The outcomes are completely made up.

20:53.250 --> 20:55.959
The mayor was found guilty
of lying, stealing

20:56.041 --> 20:58.000
and talking in a ridiculous
cartoony voice.

20:58.083 --> 21:00.834
Ridiculous? I think not.

21:03.667 --> 21:06.667
Gabe Duncan eventually made it
to Super Adventure Land.

21:06.750 --> 21:10.166
He was thrown in jail three minutes later
for spitting off the monorail.

21:13.583 --> 21:17.500
PJ Duncan did not go on to a career
in fashion design.

21:20.959 --> 21:24.375
Amy Duncan just likes having
her picture taken.
