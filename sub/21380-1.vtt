this is a hub of

to put his hands in the air

15:45.244 --> 15:46.541
when I told him
not to move?

15:46.612 --> 15:48.102

you take it back.

What are you clowns
doing here?

15:52.284 --> 15:53.342

15:53.419 --> 15:55.717
We got a call about a homeless
guy kicking in the door.

15:55.788 --> 15:57.187
Do I look like
a homeless guy?

16:08.233 --> 16:10.292
"I now have
the power." Power.

16:11.170 --> 16:12.762
Who in this town
has power?

16:13.339 --> 16:15.398
A power lifter?
Maybe a bodybuilder.

16:16.008 --> 16:18.738
MMA guy.
Electrician, ranger.

16:19.878 --> 16:21.140
A Power Ranger.

16:21.680 --> 16:22.669
Yes.

16:23.315 --> 16:24.475
(SIMMONS WHISTLES)

16:25.751 --> 16:27.844
Hey, didn't the Captain tell
you to work from your desk?

16:28.120 --> 16:29.451
What can I say?

16:29.521 --> 16:31.614
I couldn't resist seeing
you two heroes in action.

(GLASS SHATTERS)

16:45.604 --> 16:46.798
Hey, little guy.

16:48.607 --> 16:49.596

Hey!

17:04.323 --> 17:05.756
(STAMMERS) Wait.

17:06.492 --> 17:08.756
Before you do
whatever you're about to do,

17:09.528 --> 17:11.051
let me just say two words.

17:11.663 --> 17:12.686
Look out!

(CONTINUES LAUGHING)

18:29.007 --> 18:30.497
You've had
quite the day, Detective.

18:32.744 --> 18:34.735
Would you like to tell me what
you were doing at that building?

18:34.813 --> 18:36.041
Following a lead.

18:36.115 --> 18:37.912
A lead which you didn't share
with anyone else.

18:38.584 --> 18:39.949
And, as it turns out,

18:40.018 --> 18:42.578
a lead that's gonna cost you
another front door.

18:45.891 --> 18:47.119
I found a bunch of these.

18:51.196 --> 18:54.359
Leyden Industries makes
batteries, totally legit.

18:54.666 --> 18:56.224
And it's not
a city-owned building

18:56.301 --> 18:57.928
like the other
Badge Bandit targets.

18:59.238 --> 19:00.671
So, what's the connection?

19:01.273 --> 19:03.707
I would try to find out,
but I am sitting here

19:03.775 --> 19:05.436
getting scolded
in a very small chair.

19:05.677 --> 19:07.304
That's intentional, right,
the very small chair?

19:07.379 --> 19:10.075
The Mayor is watching
closely how we handle this.

19:10.582 --> 19:13.813
So, I think we need some fresh eyes
on this until things calm down.

19:14.253 --> 19:16.084
Until you calm down.

the lead on this for now,

from your desk.

know who you are or...

just say "pipsqueak"?

Goodbye.

Are you on the big case?

20:19.818 --> 20:20.910
The Badge Bandit?

20:20.986 --> 20:22.214
The guy who set off
stink bombs

20:22.287 --> 20:24.721
in all the city buses without
a single person spotting him?

20:27.459 --> 20:28.585
Is this the file?

20:31.029 --> 20:32.018
Suit yourself.

20:32.965 --> 20:35.991
Guess I'll just pursue
this big lead on my own.

20:36.401 --> 20:37.663
Yeah, good,
you do that.

20:38.103 --> 20:40.162
I would break
this case wide open.

20:40.472 --> 20:42.064
Right, you betcha.

Okay!

Okay,
what's the big lead?

21:00.959 --> 21:02.051
Make yourself at home.

21:09.534 --> 21:11.866
I saw it fly out of the window
of that building you were in.

21:14.506 --> 21:15.700
Drones.

21:16.475 --> 21:17.965
That's how he escaped
from the library.

21:18.043 --> 21:19.476
He was never there
in the first place.

21:19.811 --> 21:21.574
He gets drones to do
his dirty work.

21:22.080 --> 21:23.809
But why would he be interested
in high-tech batteries?

21:24.149 --> 21:25.980
That's what
we gotta find out.

21:26.451 --> 21:27.611
Yeah.

21:28.520 --> 21:29.612
Wait a second.

21:30.055 --> 21:31.181
Where did... How did...

21:31.256 --> 21:32.245
I was recording it.

21:32.524 --> 21:34.492
It pursued me,
so I took it out.

21:34.960 --> 21:36.052
You took it out?

21:36.194 --> 21:37.286
After it took a shot at me.

21:37.362 --> 21:38.420
It took a shot at you?

are armed.

couple of things right out there,

but I don't need
an overeager kid

21:50.842 --> 21:52.332
interfering with my case,
you understand?

21:53.378 --> 21:54.367
Yeah.

Do you understand?

Yes.

I'm a dangerous criminal,

who has lodged
M&Ms up his nose...

24:21.126 --> 24:22.286

24:22.661 --> 24:23.992
That's what I said.

24:24.062 --> 24:25.859
Anyway, there's
this gaggle of doctors

trying to figure out
which tweezers to use

24:27.699 --> 24:29.462
and whether or not they
should sedate the poor kid,

24:29.534 --> 24:31.001
because he is
screaming hysterically.

24:31.503 --> 24:33.027
So, just as they're
about to book the OR,

24:33.371 --> 24:35.168
I come running in
with my hair dryer,

24:35.240 --> 24:38.403

out of his nose in about 30 seconds.

28:46.057 --> 28:47.854
As for your
second question,

28:48.693 --> 28:52.424
this is my undercover outfit, so
no one suspects I'm on the case.

28:53.798 --> 28:55.629
Yeah,
that's pretty inconspicuous.

like a kid's toy to me.

body, maybe some Kevlar.

about all that stuff?

a little edgy.

41:24.014 --> 41:26.346

41:26.851 --> 41:28.045

been committing the crimes

42:20.538 --> 42:21.937
Well, go ahead.

42:22.840 --> 42:24.273
Ask him where
he got the lead.

42:24.775 --> 42:26.936
What is the most important
thing is that I... We.

42:27.011 --> 42:29.741
...might have gotten a glimpse
of someone on the scene

42:29.813 --> 42:32.441
who could be our suspect, but
before I could question him, I...

42:32.516 --> 42:35.576
We got into a gnarly scrape
with a bunch of those drones,

42:36.120 --> 42:38.645
and Detective Simmons went
full-on superhero mode,

42:39.123 --> 42:40.920
took a couple
laser zaps for me...

42:41.158 --> 42:43.217
And came straight here
to fill you in.

42:44.762 --> 42:45.956
You didn't tell her
the best part.

42:46.030 --> 42:47.725
I think she's heard plenty.
CAPTAIN: No.

42:47.798 --> 42:52.235
No, sweetie,
I'd love to hear more.

42:52.836 --> 42:54.428
I drove.

42:55.839 --> 42:57.306
The squad car?

42:57.675 --> 43:00.075
Yeah. Well, sort of. It was
more of a team effort.

43:00.144 --> 43:02.203
So, anyway, the drones
were hot on our tail,

43:02.279 --> 43:04.975
so we threw some evasive
maneuvers at them and lost 'em.

earned my way back on this case.

sneak back out there.

gonna find anything.

is insane.

45:25.522 --> 45:27.581
Try 25,000.

45:27.791 --> 45:29.224
Whoa!

45:34.331 --> 45:37.357
Might have to translate.
(WHISPERS) Flip phone.

45:41.638 --> 45:45.699
Uh, the idea is that capacity
for a cell this size

45:45.776 --> 45:47.243
is usually measured
in hours.

45:47.511 --> 45:50.309
This one would be measured in days.
Or weeks.

45:50.614 --> 45:51.774
All that from
a little battery?

45:52.116 --> 45:54.516
Small, but very potent.

45:54.585 --> 45:55.984
Like me.

45:56.220 --> 45:59.712
Even the best consumer drones can
only fly for 10, maybe 15 minutes.

46:00.023 --> 46:03.083
A drone with this much power could stay
aloft indefinitely without recharging.

46:03.427 --> 46:05.292
With an energy source
this size,

46:05.529 --> 46:07.053
the speed
would be ridonkulous.

46:07.931 --> 46:10.832
Plus, those mini-laser weapons would
have the power to melt steel.

46:11.268 --> 46:12.826
This is
military-grade stuff.

46:13.437 --> 46:14.961

more power.

stand by. Keep a look out.

46:17.107 --> 46:18.096

This guy is planning
something bigger.

46:19.977 --> 46:21.911
CAPTAIN: The warehouse
is totally clean.

46:21.979 --> 46:24.641
No drones,
no humans, no nothing.

46:25.582 --> 46:27.675
You were right,
but now what?

46:28.352 --> 46:29.910
He and his drones
could be anywhere.

46:30.087 --> 46:31.486
And we have no way
to track them.

46:32.856 --> 46:34.221
I have a way to track them.

46:36.527 --> 46:38.586
(YELPS)
I hate these things!

46:41.098 --> 46:42.087
(SIGHS)

46:44.268 --> 46:45.667
What did you mean
back there about

46:45.736 --> 46:46.998
having ways to
track the drones?

46:47.271 --> 46:49.671
I'm about to show you
some real police work.

46:49.740 --> 46:52.300
No cameras, no gadgets,
no hard drives

46:52.376 --> 46:53.968
that make scary
whirring noises.

46:54.978 --> 46:56.172
We're going old school.

46:59.683 --> 47:01.275
Cops today rely too much
on technology.

47:01.885 --> 47:05.082
It's put a void between the
citizens and the police.

47:05.455 --> 47:08.219
Before computers, we had
to be out on the streets.

47:09.026 --> 47:11.654
Among the people, taking
the pulse of the city.

47:12.262 --> 47:15.459
When it comes down to it, good police
work is all about relationships.

47:17.367 --> 47:18.766
What's shakin', Detective?

47:19.303 --> 47:20.793
You know that guy?

47:22.105 --> 47:24.005
Listen up, gentlemen,
for the next three minutes,

47:24.074 --> 47:26.440
Slim-Mart havin' a "Do Not Ask
Where It Come From" sale.

47:26.743 --> 47:30.304
I got all the best. Genuine
Gucci, Tory Burch, Coach.

47:30.848 --> 47:32.338
That looks like a hustle.

47:32.916 --> 47:34.247
I bet it's all counterfeit.

47:37.454 --> 47:38.648
Hey, Slim,
how's business?

47:38.722 --> 47:40.747
Detective Simmons.
My man.

47:44.161 --> 47:46.629
It just me, or the rookies getting
younger and younger all the time?

47:46.697 --> 47:47.686
(BOTH LAUGHING)

47:50.667 --> 47:51.827
(CLEARS THROAT)

47:52.369 --> 47:54.098
I could use
a little information, Slim.

47:54.171 --> 47:57.197
And Slim needs to write seven
alimony checks by Saturday.

48:01.678 --> 48:03.168
(GRUNTS)
You like this one?

48:03.480 --> 48:04.674
Absolutely not.

48:04.748 --> 48:05.737
We'll take it.

48:06.617 --> 48:09.211
You know anything about a psycho
who likes to play with drones?

48:09.386 --> 48:10.648
Oh, Slim know
lots of psychos,

48:10.721 --> 48:12.052
but what the heck's
a drone?

48:13.390 --> 48:14.823
An unmanned,
video-piloted quadcopter.

48:17.461 --> 48:18.860
Slim don't know
nothin' 'bout that,

48:19.529 --> 48:22.862
but Slim will toss some stones
into the water, see what ripples.

48:33.543 --> 48:35.534
You're not gonna arrest him?
For what?

48:36.113 --> 48:38.308
Peddling counterfeit goods,
selling without a permit,

48:38.682 --> 48:40.445
referring to himself
in the third person?

48:42.085 --> 48:43.677
You gotta pick
your battles, kid.

48:44.187 --> 48:46.348
Slim has got connections
that the cops don't.

48:47.057 --> 48:48.615
If someone is making
souped-up drones,

48:49.026 --> 48:51.085
that someone might
need guys to help him.

48:51.495 --> 48:53.725
Guys who Slim might
associate with.

48:54.831 --> 48:56.856
Slim was definitely shady.

48:59.937 --> 49:02.701
Whatever.
I can't accept that.

49:03.206 --> 49:04.400
There's nothing illegal
about that bag.

49:04.474 --> 49:06.101
Uh, it's
totally counterfeit.

49:06.310 --> 49:07.368
Look a little closer.

49:08.445 --> 49:10.037
"Coach" is not spelled
with a "K."

49:23.694 --> 49:25.059
Something just isn't
sitting right.

49:25.629 --> 49:27.256
It's that
disgusting food you eat.

49:27.864 --> 49:30.492
Even my dog, Lucy,
would turn her butt to that.

49:31.802 --> 49:34.600
I mean, the Badge Bandit's been running
the department in circles for weeks.

49:35.238 --> 49:36.364
He's always
one step ahead of us,

49:36.440 --> 49:38.237
like he knows what we're
gonna do before we do it.

49:40.210 --> 49:41.609
You know what
my dad would say?

49:42.346 --> 49:45.679
Sometimes the most obvious
answer is the right one.

49:47.317 --> 49:49.217
So, who would know that much
about police procedure?

49:51.388 --> 49:54.289
An ex-cop would know exactly
how to stage a crime scene.

49:55.092 --> 49:56.491
Interesting theory.

49:59.096 --> 50:00.563
Sure you don't want a bite? Ew!

50:01.098 --> 50:03.396
Processed food can lead
to high cholesterol,

50:03.700 --> 50:06.999
high blood pressure,
chronic grumpiness...

50:08.372 --> 50:09.600
I don't worry about it.

50:10.440 --> 50:11.998
What about your
close family and friends?

50:12.309 --> 50:13.469
Don't have any.

50:14.411 --> 50:15.605
I researched you online.

50:17.147 --> 50:18.546
You were a rock-star cop,

50:19.149 --> 50:21.174
all kinds of accolades
and awards.

50:23.253 --> 50:24.481
What changed?

50:29.893 --> 50:31.087
It was one case.

50:36.767 --> 50:39.793
You've been gone all day. Won't
your mother be getting worried?

50:40.303 --> 50:42.168
I texted her to
let her know I was okay.

50:43.140 --> 50:44.334

50:59.156 --> 51:00.384
See? You like it.

51:00.624 --> 51:02.615

totally get a phone

51:02.692 --> 51:05.593
that doesn't have the word "flip"
in it, and we should FaceTime.

51:06.430 --> 51:08.523
"FaceTime"?
It's like a video chat

51:08.598 --> 51:10.793
where you can talk
while looking at each other.

You found that?

52:53.737 --> 52:55.671
Exactly how much
have you shared with

this whole adventure?

No.

speak with her.

for me to say hello,

since we didn't have a formal
introduction at the warehouse.

56:36.259 --> 56:38.921
Nice investigative work,
by the way.

56:40.430 --> 56:42.660
You seem to be
the only one capable

56:42.732 --> 56:44.495
of following
the breadcrumbs I've left

56:44.567 --> 56:47.058
for your
pathetic police force.

56:47.537 --> 56:49.903
Don't you mean
our police force, pal?

liked that very much.

our paths are destined

to collide
in a much different way.

allowing you to get, Detective.

is either retired, in their 80s,

57:40.056 --> 57:41.387

so many cops in one place

show at the Academy.

What is it, Simmons?

57:59.008 --> 58:01.238
What if it's not an ex-cop,
but a wannabe cop?

58:01.311 --> 58:03.279
Somebody who wanted to be on
the force but never made it.

58:03.713 --> 58:05.772
That would certainly be
grounds for a vendetta.

It's like someone
messed with the file.

Why would
a civilian recruit

58:49.325 --> 58:51.259
wear a full uniform
for his application pic?

58:51.561 --> 58:53.119
I think that's
a Halloween costume.

Can you unblur
the picture?

59:01.638 --> 59:03.936
I could try to run some facial

01:12:12.895 --> 01:12:14.089
CAPTAIN: Perfect match.

01:12:14.663 --> 01:12:16.062
Well done, people.

01:12:17.232 --> 01:12:18.256
Okay, here's the plan.

01:12:18.400 --> 01:12:21.460
We are going to infiltrate the suspect's
drone cluster with our decoys,

01:12:21.770 --> 01:12:23.738
then going to follow them
back to his hideout.

01:12:24.373 --> 01:12:26.136
Oliver, you'll pilot
the decoys.

01:12:27.443 --> 01:12:29.604
Oh, uh, I don't know
about that.

01:12:30.713 --> 01:12:33.807
Not everyone's qualified
to do actual police stuff.

01:12:34.083 --> 01:12:35.710
We need you, Oliver.

01:12:35.784 --> 01:12:37.115
SIMMONS: You know, Cap,

01:12:39.755 --> 01:12:41.313
I think Karina should pilot
one of the drones.

01:12:42.891 --> 01:12:44.153
She's a whiz
at that kind of thing.

01:12:46.495 --> 01:12:48.486
I'm not saying she could
land a fighter jet

01:12:48.564 --> 01:12:50.156
on an aircraft carrier
or anything.

01:12:51.367 --> 01:12:52.698
Actually,
she probably could.

01:12:53.369 --> 01:12:54.700
CAPTAIN:
That's a good idea.

01:12:54.770 --> 01:12:56.738
She'll be safe here, away
from any physical danger,

01:12:57.005 --> 01:12:58.302
and if one of
the drones goes down,

01:12:58.374 --> 01:12:59.568
the other one
will finish the job.

01:12:59.808 --> 01:13:00.866
Roger that, Cap.

01:13:01.744 --> 01:13:04.440
Meanwhile, Detective Simmons
will lead a small tactical unit

01:13:04.513 --> 01:13:06.071
to tail the drones
to their landing site.

01:13:06.315 --> 01:13:07.373
BOTH: Banzai!

01:13:08.817 --> 01:13:10.652
Let's take
this guy down.

01:13:19.595 --> 01:13:21.654
I got a pack of 'em,
headed west,

01:13:21.730 --> 01:13:23.357
away from
the downtown corridor.

01:13:23.432 --> 01:13:24.660
I see them.

01:13:24.933 --> 01:13:26.662
Maneuvering the decoys
into the pack.

01:13:27.002 --> 01:13:28.697
Nice and easy.

Good work, you two.

01:13:37.679 --> 01:13:40.546
Matthews, O'Leary, stay
close but not too close.

01:13:41.116 --> 01:13:42.879
Don't want those drones
spotting us on their tail.

O'LEARY: Sorry.

Entering some kind of warehouse,
and the eagles have landed.

01:14:23.125 --> 01:14:25.616

01:15:48.477 --> 01:15:52.243
I don't get it. All this
evidence just sitting around.

01:15:52.314 --> 01:15:54.714
Well, without his drones,
he's done.

No, thanks. I still got

CAPTAIN: I guess Dewey thought
we were getting too close,

01:17:45.327 --> 01:17:47.488
so he decided to pull the
plug on his operation

01:17:47.562 --> 01:17:48.756
and go out with a bang.

01:17:48.930 --> 01:17:49.919
Literally.

But what was the point?

01:17:53.168 --> 01:17:55.728
Like the poem said, to make us
look bad in the eyes of the city.

01:17:56.471 --> 01:17:57.802
But in a weird way,

01:17:58.106 --> 01:18:00.768

the best in us.

out of a drone.

the Mayor's address

when we thought we were
going to Dewey's place.

He knew about
the plan tonight!

drones back to their home base,

01:18:54.329 --> 01:18:56.194
so he could blow them all
to smithereens!

is working with Dewey?

to wear the uniform.

01:26:24.979 --> 01:26:26.139
(SCREAMING)

01:26:31.419 --> 01:26:32.408
(GASPS)

01:26:33.521 --> 01:26:34.545
(CRACKLES)

01:26:34.622 --> 01:26:36.283
Karina!
I've got her, Sarah! Run!

01:26:36.524 --> 01:26:37.548
Okay.

01:26:40.461 --> 01:26:42.156
We've got to take
this thing down!

01:26:44.199 --> 01:26:47.259
I have an idea, but I need
you to stay right here.

01:26:47.335 --> 01:26:49.030
You should know
better than that by now.

01:26:52.740 --> 01:26:53.764
(WHIMPERING)

01:26:53.841 --> 01:26:55.934
I was gonna run
for governor.

01:26:56.511 --> 01:26:58.877
(CRYING) I still have shoes
I've never worn.

01:27:00.515 --> 01:27:02.039
Hi, fellas.
I need a favor.

01:27:02.717 --> 01:27:03.911
Do you think this thing
still works?

01:27:04.185 --> 01:27:06.619
She'll fire,
but only a spark.

01:27:06.821 --> 01:27:08.982
We got one shell
to make a spark.

01:27:12.293 --> 01:27:17.595
Now, the thing that goes boom goes
in there and comes out there.

01:27:18.099 --> 01:27:21.000
Just make sure to
put these in here.

01:27:21.970 --> 01:27:23.130
Gunpowder's not
going to be enough.

01:27:23.204 --> 01:27:25.138
We need to find something
to shoot outta this thing.

01:27:26.874 --> 01:27:27.863
How about

01:27:32.780 --> 01:27:33.769
this?

01:27:34.616 --> 01:27:36.743
Karina, are you sure?

01:27:39.921 --> 01:27:40.910
Positive.

01:27:54.269 --> 01:27:55.736
It's headed for the station!

01:27:58.773 --> 01:28:00.104
(GRUNTS)

01:28:06.547 --> 01:28:07.912
A little left!

01:28:08.549 --> 01:28:09.573
A little more!

01:28:09.651 --> 01:28:11.846
SIMMONS: It's too heavy.
This thing weighs a ton!

01:28:12.654 --> 01:28:13.951
(RUMBLING)

01:28:15.990 --> 01:28:17.116
Who are you again?

01:28:17.759 --> 01:28:19.158
I'm her deputy.

01:28:22.230 --> 01:28:23.527
(BOTH GRUNTING)

01:28:28.636 --> 01:28:30.001
We've gotta take it out now.

01:28:32.407 --> 01:28:33.465
Fire!

01:28:44.452 --> 01:28:45.714
Direct hit!

01:28:46.087 --> 01:28:47.520
(BEEPING RAPIDLY)

01:28:48.823 --> 01:28:49.812
Oh. No.

01:28:51.192 --> 01:28:52.181
(EXPLODES)

01:28:52.260 --> 01:28:53.454
(CHEERING)

01:28:53.695 --> 01:28:55.526
Now, that's what
I'm talking about!

01:28:56.964 --> 01:28:58.295
(ALL CHEERING)

01:28:59.467 --> 01:29:00.559
Yes!

01:29:02.203 --> 01:29:03.795
Oh! Boo-ya!

01:29:05.640 --> 01:29:06.629
Karina!

01:29:09.911 --> 01:29:11.503
I am so proud of you.

01:29:11.879 --> 01:29:13.346
Just an average day.

01:29:15.283 --> 01:29:16.375
ALL: Aw.

01:29:42.944 --> 01:29:45.538
KARINA: I learned a lot from my days
on the front lines of the police force.

01:29:46.447 --> 01:29:49.712
Mostly, I learned that I have
plenty of time to become a cop.

01:29:51.886 --> 01:29:54.446
Right now,
I'm cool with being a kid.

01:29:55.857 --> 01:29:57.085
Hey, Karina.

01:29:57.158 --> 01:29:59.149
There's a party at my place on Friday.
You wanna come?

01:29:59.827 --> 01:30:00.987
Okay. Sounds fun.

01:30:01.062 --> 01:30:03.053
Cool, and invite
your friend, Bobby C.

01:30:03.131 --> 01:30:04.860
Will do.
Bye.

01:30:06.467 --> 01:30:08.526
KARINA: And really,
when it comes down to it,

01:30:08.803 --> 01:30:11.772
good police work
is all about relationships.

01:30:12.039 --> 01:30:13.700
Morning, Officer.

01:30:14.642 --> 01:30:17.543
I believe
this belongs to you.

01:30:27.155 --> 01:30:28.417
Way to go, kiddo.

01:30:29.524 --> 01:30:31.048
KARINA:
But don't get me wrong,

01:30:31.592 --> 01:30:33.059
in this day and age,

01:30:33.127 --> 01:30:35.220
even the most
old-school curmudgeons

01:30:35.296 --> 01:30:37.321
need to make room for
a little technology.

01:30:40.301 --> 01:30:43.236
"Pretty slow on
my watch. You?"

01:30:49.510 --> 01:30:52.035
"Hope you're prepared."

01:30:53.014 --> 01:30:54.709
(PHONE CHIMES)

01:31:05.860 --> 01:31:06.849
(CAMERA CLICKS)

01:31:12.733 --> 01:31:14.200
(CHUCKLES)

01:33:04.545 --> 01:33:06.308
(WHIRRING)

01:33:47.054 --> 01:33:48.578
All right, kicking
down doors is an art,

01:33:48.656 --> 01:33:51.124
one that is totally underappreciated
by today's rookies.

01:33:51.192 --> 01:33:53.820
So, we're gonna start with your
basic surprise burst-in maneuver.

01:33:54.095 --> 01:33:56.620
You line yourself up, you square
yourself up to your target,

01:33:56.697 --> 01:33:57.994
you lock in your core

01:33:58.065 --> 01:34:00.033
so that you can swivel it to a
45-degree angle, just like...
