09:37.869 --> 09:39.079
The only thing
she hates more than football

09:39.079 --> 09:40.705
are football players themselves.
Stop that.

09:40.705 --> 09:42.123
I'm just saying.

09:42.123 --> 09:44.417
(Noannie)
What do you need money for,
anyway?

09:44.417 --> 09:45.418
Look, Noannie‐‐

09:45.418 --> 09:46.920
A man needs money.

09:46.920 --> 09:49.547
Hey, Mattie.
What's going on?

09:49.547 --> 09:51.758
What's up, baby?
Looking sharp in that hat.

09:51.758 --> 09:53.843
Oh, man.
Shut up.

09:53.843 --> 09:55.887
Yeah,
pimpin', pimpin'.

09:55.887 --> 09:58.848
Listen, how long you been
workin' here?

09:58.848 --> 10:02.602
I don't know.
About a year or so.

10:02.602 --> 10:04.604
Yeah?
Mm‐hmm.

10:04.604 --> 10:05.605
Brian!

10:05.605 --> 10:07.732
Can we order?

10:07.732 --> 10:09.901
I'm gonna deal with you
in one second.

10:09.901 --> 10:12.237
How much money do you make
working here?

10:12.237 --> 10:15.198
Everybody just starts out
at minimum wage, so...

10:15.198 --> 10:17.700
Okay, okay.

10:17.700 --> 10:20.620
You think you can get
the Smash an application?

10:20.620 --> 10:21.454
For real.

10:21.454 --> 10:23.665
Yeah, I'll just talk
to the manager.

10:23.665 --> 10:25.125
Go talk to him.

10:25.125 --> 10:26.751
I'll be right back.

10:26.751 --> 10:28.586
(Noannie)
Be serious, Brian.

10:28.586 --> 10:29.629
You walkin' home.

10:40.473 --> 10:41.975
Hi.

10:45.812 --> 10:47.021
Hi.

10:50.567 --> 10:51.609
He knows.

10:51.609 --> 10:53.945
What?

10:53.945 --> 10:54.946
Tim, he knows.

10:54.946 --> 10:56.990
Jason knows.

11:00.660 --> 11:03.163
[sighs]

11:03.163 --> 11:04.831
Does he know
because you told him?

11:04.831 --> 11:05.748
No.

11:05.748 --> 11:07.667
He asked me.
Well, I didn't tell him.

11:07.667 --> 11:08.626
He asked me
if something happened

11:08.626 --> 11:09.669
and I said no, but‐‐

11:09.669 --> 11:10.920
Then there's nothing else
to do.

11:10.920 --> 11:12.255
We're done.

11:12.255 --> 11:13.673
You called it off,
so it's off.

11:13.673 --> 11:15.508
As far as I'm concerned,

11:15.508 --> 11:17.135
you're Jay's girl
and always have been.

11:17.135 --> 11:19.679
So let's move on.

11:19.679 --> 11:20.847
How?

11:23.183 --> 11:24.642
Hey, Lyla.

11:24.642 --> 11:25.810
Hi.

11:25.810 --> 11:28.021
How's Jason doing?

11:28.021 --> 11:29.272
He's good.

11:31.316 --> 11:32.859
He's real good.

11:32.859 --> 11:34.694
Um, I just actually
came by

11:34.694 --> 11:36.821
to invite Tim.

11:36.821 --> 11:38.031
Jason's doing a scrimmage thing

11:38.031 --> 11:40.700
this Thursday
at the center.

11:40.700 --> 11:42.535
That's really sweet.

11:43.328 --> 11:44.829
Yeah.

11:46.873 --> 11:49.709
Thanks for letting me know.
Yeah, see ya.

11:49.709 --> 11:51.211
(Tyra)
Real nice of you
to stop by.

11:57.133 --> 11:58.927
[car engine starting]

12:08.549 --> 12:10.384
So I slap it
out of his hand.

12:10.384 --> 12:12.636
He leans into me.
He gets real close.

12:12.636 --> 12:14.388
Right in his nose.

12:14.388 --> 12:16.557
[laughter]

12:16.557 --> 12:18.058
(JD)
Blood everywhere, I bet.

12:18.058 --> 12:20.561
[laughter]

12:20.561 --> 12:22.396
Midget,
toss you out the window.

12:22.396 --> 12:23.772
Oh!
[laughter]

12:26.567 --> 12:27.443
You tell the boys here

12:27.443 --> 12:31.071
that I'm gonna come scrimmage
on Thursday?

12:33.073 --> 12:34.408
(Street)
I'm ready.

12:34.408 --> 12:35.325
I told you I'm ready.

12:35.325 --> 12:36.118
(Phil)
Jason, you're not ready.

12:36.118 --> 12:37.578
(Street)
Phil, come on.

12:37.578 --> 12:38.746
Everyday it's about how great

12:38.746 --> 12:39.747
my progress has been.

12:39.747 --> 12:41.248
And how unusual I am.

12:41.248 --> 12:42.249
What's the worst
that could happen, huh?

12:42.249 --> 12:44.084
I fall out of my chair,
break my neck‐‐oh, wait.

12:44.084 --> 12:45.335
That already happened,
didn't it?

12:45.335 --> 12:48.255
(Phil)
You could tear
your rotator cuff.

12:48.255 --> 12:50.090
You can get a concussion.

12:50.090 --> 12:51.592
Worst case scenario,

12:51.592 --> 12:52.426
your fusion's still healing.

12:53.677 --> 12:54.636
You don't seem to know
what that means,

12:54.636 --> 12:57.431
so let me spell it out
for you.

12:57.431 --> 12:59.099
Those little bits of bone
are all that's protecting

12:59.099 --> 13:01.602
your spinal cord
at your injury sight.

13:01.602 --> 13:02.603
You know how
you can use your hands?

13:02.603 --> 13:04.271
Screw up your fusion‐‐

13:04.271 --> 13:07.691
No more grip.
Then what?

13:07.691 --> 13:09.610
I want you to think
long and hard about this

13:09.610 --> 13:11.695
before you do it.

13:12.821 --> 13:15.407
[snickers]
You're really
moving me, Phil.

13:17.284 --> 13:19.119
If you hadn't noticed,
we are crippled.

13:19.119 --> 13:21.288
Kicking a boy
while he's down.

13:21.288 --> 13:23.290
(all)
Captain Bringdown!

13:23.290 --> 13:25.459
[shouting]

13:25.459 --> 13:27.127
(Phil)
I don't know why I do this.

13:27.127 --> 13:28.754
(Herc)
Captain Bringdown, let's show
that super speed you got.

13:29.630 --> 13:32.549
(Tami)
Lyla!

13:32.549 --> 13:34.468
Hey, Lyla.

13:34.468 --> 13:35.636
Hey, sweetie.
How are you?

13:35.636 --> 13:36.470
I'm good.
Good.

13:36.470 --> 13:37.304
You know, I was wondering,

13:37.304 --> 13:39.389
Would you mind
just telling your mom

13:39.389 --> 13:42.100
I am not even halfway through
The Secret Life of Bees‐‐

13:44.311 --> 13:45.479
Sweetheart...

13:45.479 --> 13:47.147
I'm sorry‐‐

13:49.316 --> 13:51.527
[crying]

13:51.527 --> 13:54.196
(Tami)
Is it over
with you and Tim Riggins?

13:54.196 --> 13:55.614
[Lyla crying]
Yes.
Is it, really?

13:55.614 --> 13:58.575
Yes, absolutely.

13:58.575 --> 14:00.494
(Tami)
Can I give you
a piece of advice?

14:00.494 --> 14:03.830
Yeah, please.

14:03.830 --> 14:07.834
Jason Street
has been hurt...

14:07.834 --> 14:10.671
worse than he has been
in his whole life.

14:10.671 --> 14:12.172
I know.

14:12.172 --> 14:15.425
Don't you hurt him more, girl.

14:15.425 --> 14:17.177
But‐‐

14:17.177 --> 14:19.596
You would not be telling him
for him.

14:19.596 --> 14:23.267
You would be telling him
for you.

14:23.267 --> 14:26.770
You let him heal.

14:26.770 --> 14:29.648
You move on with your life.
You let him heal.

14:36.822 --> 14:38.282
What do you want me
to cook for dinner

14:38.282 --> 14:39.366
when the Riggins boys
come over?

14:39.366 --> 14:40.701
Should I slaughter a goat?

14:40.701 --> 14:43.370
(Taylor)
Mmm, slaughtered goat
would be fine.

14:43.370 --> 14:44.871
Hey, kiddo.

14:44.871 --> 14:46.707
What do you got
going on this week?

14:46.707 --> 14:48.458
Um, tomorrow
is Lois' birthday,

14:48.458 --> 14:50.627
so Katie's gonna make
some red velvet cupcakes

14:50.627 --> 14:51.461
and bring them to school.

14:51.461 --> 14:53.880
Probably go into
a sugar coma at lunch.

14:53.880 --> 14:56.717
And Matt Saracen
asked me out on a date.

14:56.717 --> 14:57.759
[bowl drops on the counter]

14:59.386 --> 15:00.721
Just putting it out there.

15:02.306 --> 15:03.849
What did you say
to him?

15:05.392 --> 15:07.394
I told him
I was considering.

15:07.394 --> 15:09.229
Oh...

15:09.229 --> 15:10.063
All right.
[bowl dropped on the counter]

15:10.063 --> 15:12.733
See, Smash,
the key with all this

15:12.733 --> 15:13.692
is really in the swirl.

15:13.692 --> 15:16.778
So that then you can get
all the candy in it

15:16.778 --> 15:18.447
and what not.

15:18.447 --> 15:19.740
Are you getting this?

15:19.740 --> 15:20.616
Yeah, yeah.

15:20.616 --> 15:22.409
I'm putting
my own little spin to it.

15:22.409 --> 15:23.994
No, that's the thing,
though.

15:23.994 --> 15:25.662
We're trying to keep product
really consistent

15:25.662 --> 15:27.497
'cause our manager's
a real stickler.

15:27.497 --> 15:28.665
Oh, man, I think I'm gonna
like this job.

15:28.665 --> 15:29.666
Why?

15:29.666 --> 15:31.418
Hey, look.
Check this out.

15:31.418 --> 15:33.420
Take notes.

15:33.420 --> 15:34.296
Hey, how you doing?

15:34.296 --> 15:36.673
Um, could I get
a scoop of mocha, please?

15:36.673 --> 15:37.674
Naw.

15:37.674 --> 15:38.675
No, no, no.

15:38.675 --> 15:39.926
You don't want that.

15:39.926 --> 15:41.261
Really?

15:41.261 --> 15:42.846
Look, what you want is

15:42.846 --> 15:44.848
a chocolate‐covered
mocha cup with jimmies.

15:44.848 --> 15:47.684
All right.

15:47.684 --> 15:48.769
If that's what you say
I want,

15:48.769 --> 15:50.270
then I'll take that.

15:50.270 --> 15:51.772
All right, well‐‐

15:51.772 --> 15:53.607
He'll get it for you.

15:53.607 --> 15:54.941
Yeah‐‐

15:54.941 --> 15:57.569
(girl)
How much to I owe you?

15:57.569 --> 15:58.987
It's on me.

15:58.987 --> 16:00.322
Are you sure?

16:00.322 --> 16:01.907
Yeah.
Thanks.

16:03.283 --> 16:04.618
(Smash)
See, that's what you do.

16:04.618 --> 16:05.452
No, that's what you do.

16:05.452 --> 16:07.454
You don't ask someone
what they want.

16:07.454 --> 16:08.455
You tell them

16:08.455 --> 16:10.374
what they want.

16:10.374 --> 16:12.584
You'll learn.
You'll learn

16:18.715 --> 16:22.010
[Tami knocking]
Jules?

16:24.638 --> 16:26.348
Brought you some clean.

16:29.810 --> 16:32.312
How's Faulkner?

16:33.980 --> 16:36.650
Good.

16:36.650 --> 16:38.527
Good.

16:38.527 --> 16:42.030
So, uh,
can I talk to you

16:42.030 --> 16:44.491
for a second.

16:44.491 --> 16:45.826
[sighs]

16:45.826 --> 16:46.993
You're just freaking out

16:46.993 --> 16:48.412
because I got asked
on a date.

16:48.412 --> 16:49.830
I'm not freaking out.
I'm not freaking out.

16:49.830 --> 16:51.915
I think it's great.
I think it's nice.

16:51.915 --> 16:55.335
I'm just, um...

16:55.335 --> 16:57.337
Freaking out.
No.

16:57.337 --> 17:00.507
I mean, I sit in that
counselor's chair all day,

17:00.507 --> 17:03.009
and I kinda get a sense
of what goes on over there

17:03.009 --> 17:04.845
at that school.

17:04.845 --> 17:06.596
And I just want
to make sure that you've‐‐

17:06.596 --> 17:07.848
You know‐‐
Are comfortable.

17:07.848 --> 17:11.017
I haven't even
told him "yes" yet.

17:11.017 --> 17:12.018
Okay, good.

17:12.018 --> 17:14.980
I mean, oh...

17:17.023 --> 17:19.109
(Smash)
Hey, man.
You're worse than the IRS.

17:19.109 --> 17:21.737
That's what your
football name should be.

17:21.737 --> 17:22.904
"The Accountant."

17:22.904 --> 17:23.989
(Saracen)
That's funny.

17:23.989 --> 17:26.533
Dammit.

17:26.533 --> 17:27.784
I'm short.

17:27.784 --> 17:29.536
Oh, yeah?
By how much?

17:29.536 --> 17:32.372
$1.10.
You gotta be kidding me.

17:32.372 --> 17:33.915
Wait, hold on a second.
Hold on, hold on.

17:56.480 --> 17:58.815
[grunting]

17:58.815 --> 17:59.983
Come on!

17:59.983 --> 18:01.568
You ain't got nothing
on me, baby!

18:01.568 --> 18:02.944
I'll get your wallet,
boy!

18:02.944 --> 18:04.780
Come on, now!

18:04.780 --> 18:06.948
Ain't you got
some medals or something?

18:10.410 --> 18:13.163
[both breathing heavily]

18:13.163 --> 18:14.498
Don't feel bad.

18:14.498 --> 18:17.501
I was all conference
last year.

18:17.501 --> 18:19.836
Yeah, that don't mean you're
ready to get on the court yet.

18:19.836 --> 18:22.089
I'm telling you.
Phil's telling you.

18:22.089 --> 18:24.925
Your doctor is telling you.

18:24.925 --> 18:27.886
Even your cute little cheater's
telling you.

18:33.850 --> 18:34.851
She didn't cheat.

18:34.851 --> 18:35.936
Oh, now, pal...

18:35.936 --> 18:38.105
You and me both know
that's not true.

18:38.105 --> 18:39.606
She is messing with you‐‐

18:39.606 --> 18:40.607
Herc‐‐

18:40.607 --> 18:42.109
And you are letting her!

18:42.109 --> 18:43.819
You're just trying to hold on

18:43.819 --> 18:46.238
to something that
don't exist anymore.

18:46.238 --> 18:47.906
You told me
what you saw.

18:47.906 --> 18:49.783
Yeah?
Well, I saw wrong, huh?

18:49.783 --> 18:51.618
Oh, you saw wrong.
That's pathetic.

18:51.618 --> 18:52.953
That is pretty pathetic.

18:52.953 --> 18:54.204
(Street)
Oh, really?
You know what's pathetic?

18:54.204 --> 18:55.622
What's that?

18:55.622 --> 18:56.957
You're little obsession
with trying to get me

18:56.957 --> 18:58.458
to break up
with my girlfriend.

18:58.458 --> 18:59.793
You got a little crush on me?

18:59.793 --> 19:00.794
You think as long as you

19:00.794 --> 19:02.796
hold on to that girlfriend‐‐

19:02.796 --> 19:05.465
The girlfriend you had
when you could walk‐‐

19:05.465 --> 19:08.093
You could avoid the reality
of being one of us.

19:10.887 --> 19:12.556
That's got nothing
to do with it.

19:12.556 --> 19:14.558
Oh, so you admit it?

19:14.558 --> 19:15.809
She's cheating, huh?

19:15.809 --> 19:17.811
Where you going?
You running away, all star?

19:17.811 --> 19:19.980
Leave it.
Leave it?

19:19.980 --> 19:21.148
Leave it!
Leave it?

19:21.148 --> 19:22.566
Ugh!
Ow!

19:22.566 --> 19:25.026
Dammit, Herc!
Argh!

19:33.994 --> 19:37.956
She's all I got, man.
So quit busting my balls.

19:42.002 --> 19:44.838
Just 'cause we're crippled...

19:44.838 --> 19:49.176
Don't mean we have
to take the crumbs.

19:54.097 --> 19:55.599
You got some secret way

19:55.599 --> 19:58.935
we get back up
on our chairs now?

19:58.935 --> 20:01.021
Uh, yeah, I do.

20:01.021 --> 20:03.023
Call Phil.

20:03.023 --> 20:05.192
Phil!

20:05.192 --> 20:07.903
Phiiiiiilll!

20:07.903 --> 20:12.866
(Herc)
Phi‐il!

20:12.866 --> 20:15.535
(Herc)
Phil!

20:15.535 --> 20:17.495
[laughing together]
Phil!

20:23.668 --> 20:25.503
(Billy)
No, that's not fair.
I shored those orders up.

20:25.503 --> 20:26.713
Well‐‐

20:26.713 --> 20:30.508
Ask Ailene.
She filed the paperwork.

20:30.508 --> 20:32.385
Come on, Jack.
I am telling you right‐‐

20:32.385 --> 20:33.470
Yeah?

20:33.470 --> 20:34.512
Well, if that's the way
you feel,

20:34.512 --> 20:35.472
you know what you can do?

20:35.472 --> 20:37.349
You can just go to hell,
you son of a bitch.

20:37.349 --> 20:38.391
(Riggins)
Let me guess‐‐

20:38.391 --> 20:40.560
Fired again, huh?

20:40.560 --> 20:42.062
Jack Gordon wouldn't know
a good salesman

20:42.062 --> 20:43.480
if one walked up
and smacked him in the mouth.

20:43.480 --> 20:45.398
Why don't you just try
selling weed again?

20:45.398 --> 20:46.316
(Billy)
Look, that was a short‐term
thing, all right.

20:46.316 --> 20:48.735
What the hell are you doing
eating that?

20:48.735 --> 20:50.445
We got dinner
in fifteen minutes.

20:50.445 --> 20:54.324
I'm so tired of being
the damn man of the house.

20:54.324 --> 20:57.994
Yeah, you really are
a good role model.

20:57.994 --> 20:59.079
You're go into your room.

20:59.079 --> 21:00.413
Comb your hair,
wash your hands,

21:00.413 --> 21:01.581
put on a clean shirt!

21:01.581 --> 21:03.333
And run a comb through your hair
for once in your life!

21:03.333 --> 21:04.626
(Riggins)
Will do, bro.

21:06.753 --> 21:07.754
(Taylor)
Hey.

21:07.754 --> 21:09.005
(Tami)
Hey.

21:09.005 --> 21:10.423
Smells good.

21:10.423 --> 21:11.424
Thank you.

21:11.424 --> 21:12.425
I hope you got that ice cream

21:12.425 --> 21:14.094
because this
is all I had time to prepare.

21:14.094 --> 21:15.262
Of course I got ice cream.

21:15.262 --> 21:16.263
It's what you just sent me out
to get.

21:16.263 --> 21:17.013
How could I forget to‐‐

21:17.013 --> 21:18.932
Hey, come here.
Hey, what's wrong?

21:18.932 --> 21:20.600
What's wrong?

21:20.600 --> 21:22.269
I think she's on the phone
with Matt Saracen.

21:22.269 --> 21:24.354
Look, you gotta stop
with this Matt Saracen thing.

21:24.354 --> 21:26.106
He's a good kid.
Don't worry about it.

21:26.106 --> 21:27.357
Just relax, would you?

21:27.357 --> 21:28.275
You know what, honey?
He's a good kid now,

21:28.275 --> 21:30.026
but he's about to become
the star quarterback

21:30.026 --> 21:31.152
of your football team,

21:31.152 --> 21:32.654
where we know they like
to just use these girls

21:32.654 --> 21:34.155
and throw them away.
Wait a sec.

21:34.155 --> 21:35.448
Wait a second there.

21:35.448 --> 21:36.616
First of all,
she's my daughter too.

21:36.616 --> 21:37.784
Second of all,
I'm not the enemy.

21:37.784 --> 21:39.286
Don't start lumping
all of us

21:39.286 --> 21:40.704
into this culture
you've created.
I'm not saying‐‐

21:40.704 --> 21:41.955
What are you talking‐‐

21:41.955 --> 21:43.290
I'm not creating
some kind of culture.

21:43.290 --> 21:44.416
[doorbell rings]

21:44.416 --> 21:46.126
All I'm saying is you can't
do anything about them.

21:46.126 --> 21:46.960
But you could talk
to you daughter.

21:46.960 --> 21:48.295
It would make me feel
really good

21:48.295 --> 21:49.629
if you could just talk
to her.

21:49.629 --> 21:52.132
Is that what you want me
to do?
From your point
of view as a‐‐

21:52.132 --> 21:53.591
I'll talk to her.
I will talk to her

21:53.591 --> 21:54.759
If you'll relax, I will talk
to her.

21:54.759 --> 21:55.802
I'll have a talk with her
tonight.

21:55.802 --> 21:57.470
Wait‐‐
I gotta get the door.

21:57.470 --> 21:58.972
You look beautiful.

21:58.972 --> 22:00.473
Now, go answer the door.
Thank you.

22:00.473 --> 22:02.600
[shouting]
Julie, get off the phone

22:02.600 --> 22:04.060
(Taylor)
Now!

22:04.060 --> 22:05.061
How's that?

22:05.061 --> 22:06.313
Oh, that's very good.

22:08.148 --> 22:09.482
Hey!
Hi, how are you doing?

22:09.482 --> 22:10.650
Good to see you again,
Tami.

22:10.650 --> 22:12.319
Come on in.

22:12.319 --> 22:14.195
Brought you a little, um,
dinner present there.

22:14.195 --> 22:15.780
Thank you,
that's great.

22:15.780 --> 22:17.490
(Taylor)
Come on in,
get something to drink.

22:17.490 --> 22:19.659
Oh, fantastic.
Thank you all.

22:19.659 --> 22:21.578
You been on break all day,
it seems like.

22:21.578 --> 22:23.663
Yeah, well, I'll tell you
when I'm done breaking.

22:23.663 --> 22:24.664
(Matt)
All right, you let me know.

22:24.664 --> 22:25.665
(Smash)
Oh...

22:25.665 --> 22:26.666
(Matt)
What?

22:26.666 --> 22:28.585
This is it.
This is the one.

22:29.502 --> 22:32.088
Uh, no‐‐
You do this‐‐

22:32.088 --> 22:33.340
One more time.
Dude, it's all you.

22:33.340 --> 22:34.341
Come on.

22:34.341 --> 22:36.301
All right.

22:36.301 --> 22:40.638
Hi, how's it‐‐
What can I do for you?

22:40.638 --> 22:44.351
Can I have an Alamo burger
and a root beer?

22:44.351 --> 22:46.353
Uh, no‐‐
I don't think‐‐

22:46.353 --> 22:48.521
I don't think
you really want that.

22:48.521 --> 22:51.191
I don't?
What do you want me to have?

22:51.191 --> 22:56.237
I don't know.
Um...

22:56.237 --> 22:58.531
Well, you wanted root beer,
so you like root beer.

22:58.531 --> 23:00.200
And I make a‐‐

23:00.200 --> 23:01.201
I make a mean
root beer float.

23:01.201 --> 23:02.202
Is that so?

23:02.202 --> 23:03.244
Mm‐hmm.

23:03.244 --> 23:05.538
Make you wanna cry.
Yeah, it's real mean.

23:05.538 --> 23:07.832
Hmm, well...

23:07.832 --> 23:10.710
Or a sundae...
With jimmies.

23:10.710 --> 23:12.212
Hmm, tempting.

23:12.212 --> 23:13.713
All right.

23:13.713 --> 23:16.549
(girl)
But I think I'll stick
with the Alamo burger

23:16.549 --> 23:18.385
and just a plain root beer.

23:18.385 --> 23:21.304
Okay, well...
Maybe next time.

23:21.304 --> 23:22.555
Oh, here.

23:22.555 --> 23:23.890
The drinks are just
right over there.

23:23.890 --> 23:25.392
Thanks.

23:25.392 --> 23:26.851
All right.

23:26.851 --> 23:28.395
What do you think?
Think that went all right?

23:28.395 --> 23:29.646
Hey, it's a start.

23:29.646 --> 23:31.564
Now, it wasn't the best.

23:31.564 --> 23:33.817
But, you know,
no shame in the game.

23:33.817 --> 23:35.068
Yeah, all right, cool.
Thanks.

23:35.068 --> 23:36.611
Look on the bright side.

23:36.611 --> 23:37.612
At least it's pay day.

23:37.612 --> 23:38.696
Speaking of which, um...

23:38.696 --> 23:40.532
Can I sign my check
over to cash?

23:40.532 --> 23:43.201
Actually, you're not gonna get
a paycheck today.

23:43.201 --> 23:44.702
Man, stop playing
with me, man.

23:44.702 --> 23:46.329
This ain't no volunteer work.

23:46.329 --> 23:47.330
No, no, but seriously.

23:47.330 --> 23:48.248
We only get paid
every two weeks.

23:48.248 --> 23:50.250
And because of processing
and everything

23:50.250 --> 23:51.543
they're always a week behind.

23:51.543 --> 23:53.586
So, you're probably
not going to get a check

23:53.586 --> 23:54.879
'til the end of the month.

23:54.879 --> 23:57.424
Maybe.
What?

23:57.424 --> 24:00.260
Sorry, man.

24:00.260 --> 24:02.554
Oh, no‐‐
This ain't right, man.

24:02.554 --> 24:03.430
But you get free ice cream.

24:03.430 --> 24:04.722
That's good.
That's a perk.

24:04.722 --> 24:06.599
No?

24:06.599 --> 24:08.268
So I grab that ball
and I just start running.

24:08.268 --> 24:09.519
And I am running and running.

24:09.519 --> 24:10.645
I am chugging down that field

24:10.645 --> 24:12.439
and the whole entire crowd
is going nuts.

24:12.439 --> 24:13.398
People were standing up
and screaming.

24:13.398 --> 24:14.399
I couldn't even hear
anything.

24:14.399 --> 24:16.609
I get all the
into the end zone.

24:16.609 --> 24:18.486
After I throw the ball down
I realize‐‐

24:18.486 --> 24:19.737
I went the wrong damn way.

24:19.737 --> 24:21.614
[laughter]
(Tami)
Oh, no!

24:21.614 --> 24:23.783
That's an awful story.

24:23.783 --> 24:26.619
Mmm, that's really nice.

24:26.619 --> 24:28.621
Truth is I was never much

24:28.621 --> 24:29.622
of a player.

24:29.622 --> 24:30.748
Not like my little brother
here.

24:30.748 --> 24:31.666
He's got the gift.

24:31.666 --> 24:33.793
(Taylor)
He's good, he's good.

24:33.793 --> 24:35.128
(Billy)
So, Coach, uh...

24:35.128 --> 24:38.256
You think he's got a shot
at college ball?

24:38.256 --> 24:40.467
Keeps playing
the way he does, yeah.

24:40.467 --> 24:43.261
I like to hear that.
Right, Tim?

24:43.261 --> 24:46.431
You bet.

24:46.431 --> 24:47.599
Do both parents live here
in Dillon?

24:47.599 --> 24:49.225
[clearing throat]

24:49.225 --> 24:50.226
Dad is down
in Corpus Christi

24:50.226 --> 24:53.646
He's working
on a driving range.

24:53.646 --> 24:55.607
Doesn't get home
a whole heck of a lot.

24:55.607 --> 24:56.774
He's a real hard worker,
the old man.

24:56.774 --> 24:57.942
(Billy)
Yeah...

24:57.942 --> 24:59.777
Shagging golf balls
for a living‐‐

24:59.777 --> 25:01.696
It's real important work.

25:01.696 --> 25:03.823
What I meant was...

25:03.823 --> 25:08.912
He sends checks
pretty often, so...

25:08.912 --> 25:10.663
That'd be twice.

25:10.663 --> 25:11.789
Two checks in six years.

25:16.836 --> 25:18.811
So, what are you
looking to do now?

25:18.811 --> 25:20.020
Whattaya got going on, Bill?

25:20.020 --> 25:21.147
You know what
I've been looking into

25:21.147 --> 25:22.022
is, um, real estate.

25:22.022 --> 25:24.024
(Taylor)
Real estate, yeah?

25:24.024 --> 25:25.484
I've been in sales
for years,

25:25.484 --> 25:27.403
so I figured once I get
my real estate license,

25:27.403 --> 25:28.404
I'll be selling
the biggest things‐‐

25:28.404 --> 25:29.488
[crash]

25:29.488 --> 25:30.573
Dammit, Tim!

25:31.574 --> 25:33.576
Um, sorry.

25:33.576 --> 25:35.035
(Taylor)
You know, the Riggins boys

25:35.035 --> 25:37.079
came over for dinner
last night.

25:37.079 --> 25:38.914
You and Tim,
you're still best friends,

25:38.914 --> 25:41.459
aren't you?

25:41.459 --> 25:42.960
I guess so.

25:42.960 --> 25:46.046
You guess so?

25:46.046 --> 25:48.591
Parents did a number
on those kids, that's for sure.

25:48.591 --> 25:50.092
Yeah, well...

25:50.092 --> 25:54.263
Everyone's got
a sad story.

25:54.263 --> 25:55.848
Doesn't excuse anything.

25:58.225 --> 26:00.102
He played
a hell of a game Friday.

26:00.102 --> 26:01.520
I'll tell you that.

26:01.520 --> 26:03.606
He'll make something
of himself

26:03.606 --> 26:05.608
If he doesn't become
his own worst enemy.

26:05.608 --> 26:06.567
So, uh...

26:06.567 --> 26:08.527
See these two cones
behind me?

26:08.527 --> 26:09.928
That's the goal line.

26:09.928 --> 26:13.473
Why don't you try
and get across it?

26:18.019 --> 26:19.354
[Taylor laughing]

26:22.065 --> 26:24.484
All right.

26:24.484 --> 26:26.361
[metal clanging together]

26:26.361 --> 26:27.445
[Taylor laughing]

26:27.445 --> 26:30.031
Try it again.

26:30.031 --> 26:32.283
Everyone says
I'm not ready for this game.

26:32.283 --> 26:34.452
Everyone says I shouldn't be
at the scrimmage tonight.

26:34.452 --> 26:35.870
Doctors, parents...

26:35.870 --> 26:40.458
Why, what‐‐

26:40.458 --> 26:42.544
What do you say?

26:42.544 --> 26:44.295
I say I am ready.

26:44.295 --> 26:46.297
I don't know,
it's just‐‐

26:46.297 --> 26:48.550
My whole life I've been
thinking about football.

26:48.550 --> 26:50.301
Football, football, football‐‐
That's all.

26:50.301 --> 26:52.470
Nothing else.

26:52.470 --> 26:54.055
Think about what it
used to feel like.

26:54.055 --> 26:55.473
Be able to compete,

26:55.473 --> 26:56.599
be able to be a part
of something, you know?

26:56.599 --> 26:58.810
I feel like...

26:58.810 --> 27:00.311
Like that whole part of me
is just empty now.

27:00.311 --> 27:04.023
It's just gone.

27:06.442 --> 27:08.987
