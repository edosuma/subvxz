Previously on "Pretty Little
Liars, The Perfectionists.."

00:03.103 --> 00:04.771
- Find something?
- No.

00:04.771 --> 00:07.374
- What are you looking for?
- Secrets.

00:07.374 --> 00:09.510
(Claire)
Dana Booker's
looking into three people

00:09.510 --> 00:11.678
in the investigation
of Nolan's murder.

00:11.678 --> 00:13.380
Nothing stays secret forever.

00:13.380 --> 00:15.282
I know you had
nothing to do with it.

00:15.282 --> 00:17.518
But Dylan is a small-town boy

00:17.518 --> 00:19.786
and Ava is a felon's daughter.

00:19.786 --> 00:21.388
Did he have something on them?

00:21.388 --> 00:23.390
- 'What is that?'
- 'It's Nolan's stash.'

00:23.390 --> 00:25.392
There's a note,
"One of you is a rat

00:25.392 --> 00:26.660
either you tell her or I will."

00:26.660 --> 00:28.528
This campus, this town..

00:28.528 --> 00:30.797
- Something's wrong here.
- What?

00:30.797 --> 00:32.799
I think Taylor Hotchkiss
might be alive.

00:32.799 --> 00:34.134
What do you know
about Mason Gregory?

00:34.134 --> 00:35.836
He used to be besties
with Nolan.

00:35.836 --> 00:37.537
And that probably ended
when Nolan started dating

00:37.537 --> 00:38.572
his girlfriend.

00:38.572 --> 00:40.307
Do you want us to walk you home?

00:40.307 --> 00:42.276
I mean, there's a killer
on the loose after all.

00:42.276 --> 00:45.846
- No, I'm-I'm good.
- Suit yourself.

00:45.846 --> 00:48.148
(Caitlin)
I think I know who was
in the woods that night.

00:48.148 --> 00:50.751
It was Mason.

00:50.751 --> 00:53.487
Ava followed Nolan
the night he was killed.

00:53.487 --> 00:56.156
And she saw him
inside the cabin with a blonde.

00:56.156 --> 00:58.158
Who you think
was Taylor Hotchkiss?

00:58.158 --> 00:59.826
It's possible.

00:59.826 --> 01:00.827
[phone beeps]

01:00.827 --> 01:02.562
Ali..

01:02.562 --> 01:03.597
Ali!

01:03.597 --> 01:05.866
Taylor Hotchkiss is dead.

01:05.866 --> 01:08.735
And I was dead myself
for a while, and so were you.

01:08.735 --> 01:10.971
Point taken.
But this isn't Rosewood.

01:10.971 --> 01:14.007
No, but this place,
there's something about it.

01:14.007 --> 01:15.842
Look, I know that's
supposed to protect us

01:15.842 --> 01:18.145
but, for god sakes, somebody
wrote, "They're watching"

01:18.145 --> 01:21.581
on my wall.
How much are they watching?

01:21.581 --> 01:24.985
Only enough to keep us safe
as far as I know.

01:24.985 --> 01:27.854
Beacon Guard didn't protect
Nolan or Taylor.

01:27.854 --> 01:29.890
If there's a chance
she faked her own death

01:29.890 --> 01:32.859
she must be hiding
from someone or something.

01:32.859 --> 01:34.594
It could've been the person
that killed Nolan.

01:34.594 --> 01:36.163
Taylor committed suicide.

01:36.163 --> 01:37.998
She jumped off
the Haskell Road Bridge.

01:37.998 --> 01:40.500
- Did they recover a body?
- No. But there were witnesses.

01:40.500 --> 01:43.003
Who said they saw someone or
something fall into the river.

01:43.003 --> 01:44.771
I read the same reports you did.

01:44.771 --> 01:47.741
You know, you're making
an awful lot out of one rose.

01:47.741 --> 01:49.142
It's more than just a rose.

01:49.142 --> 01:50.510
What are we talking about then?

01:50.510 --> 01:52.479
- A feeling.
- What kind of feeling?

01:52.479 --> 01:53.914
The same one that told me
that you're alive

01:53.914 --> 01:55.482
when everyone else
thought you were dead.

02:11.465 --> 02:14.568
This Mason theory is held
together by chewing gum.

02:14.568 --> 02:17.838
Listen, maybe Mason is like us.

02:17.838 --> 02:20.440
Nolan had something on him,
and he just decided

02:20.440 --> 02:21.875
the world would be a better
place without him.

02:21.875 --> 02:23.844
You really think
Mason killed Nolan?

02:23.844 --> 02:25.112
(Ava)
'And put that rat in my car.'

02:25.112 --> 02:27.114

he stole Nolan's stash'

02:27.114 --> 02:28.582

I put this on your tab.

02:38.458 --> 02:39.860
I know you can afford it.

02:41.595 --> 02:43.997
So, how are the Three Musketeers
doin', huh?

02:43.997 --> 02:46.133
Well, it's not like
we're exactly joined at the hip.

02:46.133 --> 02:47.901
Oh, yeah, that's right, I mean

02:47.901 --> 02:50.771
you guys were joined
at the Nolan, right?

02:50.771 --> 02:53.507
I have been thinkin' about you.

02:53.507 --> 02:54.875
- Why?
- You know, it's getting late.

02:54.875 --> 02:56.176
- I think that we should--
- 'Oh, no, no.'

02:56.176 --> 02:58.045
This won't take long.
Trust me. You can stay.

03:00.080 --> 03:02.816
No secrets
between friends, right?

03:02.816 --> 03:05.552
Or fake friends,
for that matter.

03:05.552 --> 03:08.555
- What do you want, Mason?
- I want what Nolan had.

03:08.555 --> 03:09.990
And just like him,
I'm willing to use

03:09.990 --> 03:13.093
what I know when I have to.

03:13.093 --> 03:14.828
So, we should hang out.
Soon.

03:14.828 --> 03:17.564
You know, I miss spending time
with your moms.

03:17.564 --> 03:18.965
Like the old days.

03:21.968 --> 03:25.839
Oh, Dylan, uh, buddy...I've been
reading those papers

03:25.839 --> 03:27.974
that you wrote for Nolan.
It's good stuff.

03:27.974 --> 03:29.709
Well, what makes you think
I ever did that?

03:29.709 --> 03:30.977
[chuckles]
Nice try.

03:30.977 --> 03:32.479
Look, how 'bout
you keep doing for me

03:32.479 --> 03:34.481
what you were doing
for Nolan. Alright?

03:34.481 --> 03:36.016
I don't know what you're talking
about, man. I'm sorry.

03:36.016 --> 03:37.584
Then I'll clarify.

03:37.584 --> 03:39.586
Y-you're still into
your boyfriend, right?

03:39.586 --> 03:41.588
The two of you
are still a thing?

03:41.588 --> 03:43.990
Then, same arrangement
as last year.

03:46.460 --> 03:47.994
(Alison)
'Mona, I told you.'

03:47.994 --> 03:49.863
'I think Taylor is alive.'

03:49.863 --> 03:52.766
If this can't help us find her,
why are we looking at it?

03:52.766 --> 03:54.601
You are looking
inside the core

03:54.601 --> 03:56.870
of the Hotchkiss Beacon Guard
system.

03:56.870 --> 04:00.540
And that...is
the program I wrote.

04:00.540 --> 04:01.675
It's pretty.

04:04.077 --> 04:05.412
Well, what do you
want me to say?

04:05.412 --> 04:06.546
It's letters and numbers.

04:06.546 --> 04:07.814
My letters, my numbers

04:07.814 --> 04:09.816
my crystal ball.

04:09.816 --> 04:12.085
Your Beacon Heights
success predictor.

04:12.085 --> 04:14.554
Yes, but somebody
has been messing with it.

04:14.554 --> 04:16.089
And they had me
thrown off the system

04:16.089 --> 04:18.458
so I wouldn't see the changes.

04:18.458 --> 04:20.127
So, it's not looking
for smart people anymore?

04:20.127 --> 04:21.428
Well, no,
it's still doing that.

04:21.428 --> 04:22.729
But now
it's looking for, uh

04:22.729 --> 04:25.098
particular kind of
smart person.

04:25.098 --> 04:26.967
Someone who matches
a new criteria.

04:26.967 --> 04:28.702
- What's the criteria?
- 'I don't know yet.'

04:28.702 --> 04:30.837
So far, it's only found
two people who match.

04:30.837 --> 04:31.972
Anyone we know?

04:39.446 --> 04:40.847
What do I have in common
with Caitlin?

04:40.847 --> 04:42.582
Well, I'm her advisor,
so it should be easy

04:42.582 --> 04:44.451
for me to snoop around.

04:44.451 --> 04:46.620
You're an advisor?

04:46.620 --> 04:51.024
Almost all faculty
is assigned students to mentor.

04:51.024 --> 04:52.859
It's adding somebody
to the list.

04:54.995 --> 04:56.863
"Ray Hogadorn."

04:56.863 --> 04:58.765
Who the hell's Ray Hogadorn?

05:02.536 --> 05:03.670
So, I thought
the interview

05:03.670 --> 05:05.572
for my congressional
internship was set.

05:05.572 --> 05:07.807
It is, it's just as your advisor

05:07.807 --> 05:09.943
I wanted to check-in
with you personally.

05:09.943 --> 05:12.412
So, why do want this particular
congressional internship?

05:12.412 --> 05:13.680
I mean,
wouldn't it just be easier

05:13.680 --> 05:15.816
to get a job
in your mom's office?

05:15.816 --> 05:17.083
Well, that would tell people

05:17.083 --> 05:19.085
more about my mom
than it would about me.

05:19.085 --> 05:20.987
And what do you want
people to know about you?

05:20.987 --> 05:23.557
That I'm gonna be
the first Olympic gold medalist

05:23.557 --> 05:24.691
to sit in the Oval Office.

05:24.691 --> 05:26.560
[chuckles]

05:26.560 --> 05:29.696
You know, you remind me of a
very determined friend of mine.

05:29.696 --> 05:31.431
Someone you know actually.

05:31.431 --> 05:33.700
- Alison DiLaurentis.
- Oh!

05:33.700 --> 05:35.569
- Uh, you're friends?
- Oh..

05:35.569 --> 05:37.571
We go way back,
the two of us.

05:37.571 --> 05:39.839
What do you think of her?

05:39.839 --> 05:41.708
I, uh, like her.

05:41.708 --> 05:44.477
Yeah, she seems intuitive,
loyal

05:44.477 --> 05:48.114
and she takes chances on people
when she doesn't have to.

05:48.114 --> 05:50.150
So she puts herself out there

05:50.150 --> 05:52.118
she's loyal and intuitive.

05:52.118 --> 05:54.154
- That's interesting.
- Is it?

05:54.154 --> 05:55.855
Those are the three comments
I wrote about you

05:55.855 --> 05:58.858
after our initial interview.

05:58.858 --> 06:01.828
- Oh. Wow. That's, uh--
- Thank you for stopping by.

09:47.821 --> 09:49.956
Dona's donuts and pies?
Tonight at 9:00?

09:49.956 --> 09:52.692
Coffee and pie.
How decadent.

09:52.692 --> 09:54.561
[footsteps approaching]

09:55.728 --> 09:58.565
Oh, Caitlin.
What a nice surprise.

09:58.565 --> 09:59.966
Oh, you know, Jeremy Beckett.

09:59.966 --> 10:03.136
- Jeremy, this is--
- Caitlin. We just met.

10:03.136 --> 10:06.105
Jeremy is an expert
in large-scale data analysis

10:06.105 --> 10:08.575
and a welcome addition
to Hotchkiss.

10:08.575 --> 10:10.610
Oh. Sounds impressive.

10:12.145 --> 10:14.581
Oh, your funding
has been approved.

10:14.581 --> 10:15.715
Thank you.

10:17.117 --> 10:19.319
And it was lovely meeting you,
Caitlin.

10:22.455 --> 10:23.456
Mm.

10:26.593 --> 10:28.728
I can't do it.

10:28.728 --> 10:31.865
- Do what?
- Spy on Ava and Dylan.

10:31.865 --> 10:33.766
They're my friends.

10:33.766 --> 10:36.035
I know you're helping me by
keeping that picture under wraps

10:36.035 --> 10:37.904
but you're helping you too.

10:37.904 --> 10:40.173
You're one of my mother's
biggest donors.

10:40.173 --> 10:43.009
I thought you wanted justice
for Nolan as much as I do.

10:43.009 --> 10:44.477
I do.

10:44.477 --> 10:47.647
But Booker's harassing
the wrong people.

10:47.647 --> 10:50.016
We were all together that night
at Alison's.

10:51.618 --> 10:55.021
The entire night?
All of you?

10:55.021 --> 10:56.623
Yes.

10:56.623 --> 11:00.426
And I promise,
Dana Booker is wrong about this.

11:00.426 --> 11:02.428
We want what you want.

11:02.428 --> 11:05.131
For Nolan's killer
to be brought to justice.

11:05.131 --> 11:07.700
I hope that's true, Caitlin.

11:07.700 --> 11:08.968
For your sake.

11:11.104 --> 11:12.739
You can show yourself out.

11:14.574 --> 11:16.576
[instrumental music]

11:22.148 --> 11:23.850
Get me Dana Booker.

11:27.120 --> 11:29.322
Caitlin just lied to my face.

11:30.623 --> 11:32.025
Turn up the heat.

11:35.361 --> 11:37.096
I've made a decision.

11:37.096 --> 11:39.499
I'm not gonna let
Mason blow us up.

11:39.499 --> 11:41.501
Whatever it is,
I'm totally in.

11:41.501 --> 11:42.635
Sounds like
you have a plan.

11:42.635 --> 11:44.971
Yeah, I'm gonna
hang out with him.

11:44.971 --> 11:46.973
- A bad plan.
- Yeah.

11:48.508 --> 11:50.510
Look, if Mason did what we think
he did, he's a killer.

11:50.510 --> 11:52.378
I don't think
he wants to hurt me.

11:52.378 --> 11:54.380
I mean, Mason and Nolan and I,
we all grew up here.

11:54.380 --> 11:56.249
You know, we went trick-
or-treating together as kids.

11:56.249 --> 11:58.518
Yeah, well, I went trick-
or-treating with Betsy Burnham

11:58.518 --> 12:00.320
and she was a perfectly
polite little mermaid

12:00.320 --> 12:02.956
until she sugar crashed and
tried to light my hair on fire.

12:02.956 --> 12:04.624
Yeah. Nolan's gone.

12:04.624 --> 12:06.459
Mason made it
very clear last night.

12:06.459 --> 12:07.961
He's trying to take
Nolan's place.

12:07.961 --> 12:09.362
Mason trusts me.

12:09.362 --> 12:12.231
I can use that
to find out the truth.

12:12.231 --> 12:15.068
What if I record
our conversation?

12:15.068 --> 12:16.936
If he admits to anything,
we can use it against him

12:16.936 --> 12:18.471
we just turn it into the police.

12:18.471 --> 12:20.940
And Mason goes away.

12:20.940 --> 12:23.209
Along with all our secrets.

12:23.209 --> 12:24.844
What do you guys say?

12:26.479 --> 12:28.348
Okay.

12:28.348 --> 12:31.084
But, Caitlin,
you're not doing this alone.

12:31.084 --> 12:32.952
I mean, you come up with a plan,
and Ava and I'll be there

12:32.952 --> 12:34.087
to back you up.

12:38.625 --> 12:39.993
Oh, my God.

12:42.395 --> 12:43.830
(Ava)
'Did Mason do that?'

12:45.965 --> 12:47.400
- Shit!
- Where is he?

12:49.002 --> 12:50.370
Everywhere.

12:52.505 --> 12:54.374
[camera whirring]

12:55.508 --> 12:56.976
Scoreboard messages

12:56.976 --> 12:58.511
are controlled
by the athletic offices

12:58.511 --> 13:01.080
which means that someone must've
hacked into their computer.

13:01.080 --> 13:03.583
And you think that was Mason?

13:03.583 --> 13:07.620
Yeah. He was in my programming
class and he was good.

13:07.620 --> 13:11.057
I'm better, but he was good.

13:11.057 --> 13:13.192
Yeah, we can connect him
to what we said in the woods

13:13.192 --> 13:14.494
uh, what happened at the vigil

13:14.494 --> 13:16.195
and the cabin.

13:16.195 --> 13:17.797
Where you saw the blonde.

13:19.599 --> 13:21.067
Do you guys think that
the blonde and Mason

13:21.067 --> 13:22.335
could be working together?

13:24.070 --> 13:25.371
So, who's the rat?

13:27.473 --> 13:28.941
I wasn't expecting an answer.

13:28.941 --> 13:31.110
But if Mason knows your secrets

13:31.110 --> 13:32.612
he's got all the power.

13:32.612 --> 13:35.081
Yeah. We know.

13:35.081 --> 13:37.250
If you can't tell
the world your secrets

13:37.250 --> 13:39.652
consider telling each other.

13:39.652 --> 13:42.655
Secrets have a way
of keeping you close.

13:42.655 --> 13:44.090
And you need each other.

13:45.224 --> 13:46.659
They're secrets for a reason.

13:46.659 --> 13:49.228
I didn't say
it was gonna be easy, Dylan.

13:49.228 --> 13:51.097
But I lived through this.

13:51.097 --> 13:53.499
'My friends and I,
we didn't just survive'

13:53.499 --> 13:55.968
we became family.

13:55.968 --> 13:57.970
Where did you get these books?

13:57.970 --> 14:01.307
Oh, there were just a couple
of boxes left in the basement.

14:01.307 --> 14:03.910
This book belongs
to Taylor Hotchkiss.

14:09.315 --> 14:10.917
She changed the maps.

14:13.052 --> 14:14.454
Why would she do that?

14:16.189 --> 14:17.356
I don't know.

14:20.460 --> 14:22.095
Thank you for meeting with me.

14:22.095 --> 14:23.463
I just wanted
to show you these.

14:23.463 --> 14:25.631
I found it at the house.

14:25.631 --> 14:27.200
I thought
you might wanna have them.

14:28.935 --> 14:31.804
Oh, you can keep them there.
That's where they belong.

14:35.074 --> 14:38.077
Taylor had so much imagination.

14:38.077 --> 14:40.480
She thought the Emerald City
was out there in the woods

14:40.480 --> 14:43.649
around our house
and she was going to find it.

14:43.649 --> 14:47.086
She could overlay her own
personal geography

14:47.086 --> 14:48.354
on the real world.

14:50.223 --> 14:51.491
You've lost people,
haven't you?

14:53.226 --> 14:54.393
Yes, I have.

14:54.393 --> 14:56.963
Did strangers tell you
how brave you were?

14:56.963 --> 14:58.231
Mm-hm.

14:58.231 --> 15:00.566
People are always saying
how brave I am.

15:00.566 --> 15:04.303
They said it when
Nolan was killed.

15:04.303 --> 15:06.172
They said it when Taylor left.

15:06.172 --> 15:07.573
They said it when
my husband was shot

15:07.573 --> 15:12.311
because he walked down
an alley at the precise..

15:12.311 --> 15:15.047
...wrong moment.

15:15.047 --> 15:19.318
All that loss
and look how brave she is.

15:19.318 --> 15:21.587
Being brave can make you
very tired.

15:21.587 --> 15:23.322
Yes, it can.

15:27.593 --> 15:31.330
Is that why Beacon Guard?
Because of your husband?

15:31.330 --> 15:34.200
Because you didn't want anyone
else to have to be so brave?

15:34.200 --> 15:38.805
Well, that was the idea
but, uh, not the result.

15:39.972 --> 15:41.808
Yeah, I'm sorry.

15:45.511 --> 15:48.948
(Ava)
I want you coming on stage
in the finale with your cello.

15:48.948 --> 15:50.616
And I want you shredding
something amazing

15:50.616 --> 15:52.952
and leading my models
down the runway

15:52.952 --> 15:54.620
like, you're the,
the Pied Piper or something.

15:54.620 --> 15:56.389
No, you don't want my cello.
You want..

15:58.524 --> 16:00.026
Do you play the violin?

16:00.026 --> 16:02.461
Yeah, it's got four strings
and a bow. Of course.

16:02.461 --> 16:05.598
We can rent it, too.
I mean, is that in your budget?

16:05.598 --> 16:08.167
Yeah, I'll,
I'll just figure out

16:08.167 --> 16:10.069
a way to cover it somehow.

16:10.069 --> 16:11.938
Cool.

16:11.938 --> 16:14.307
[sighs]
So, did you think about
what Alison said?

16:16.576 --> 16:18.477
About telling each other
everything?

16:18.477 --> 16:19.779
Yeah.

16:21.180 --> 16:22.315
Yeah.

16:23.449 --> 16:24.951
You first.

16:28.054 --> 16:32.091
I made a mistake that
I'm always going to regret.

16:32.091 --> 16:34.327
If you tell me what it is,
I won't judge you.

16:35.628 --> 16:39.065
Not tonight.

16:39.065 --> 16:41.334
I have to find a way
to tell someone else first.

16:49.609 --> 16:51.377
I'm late. I know. I'm sorry.

16:51.377 --> 16:55.481
Just give me 60 seconds.
I promise, I'll be ready to go.

16:55.481 --> 16:57.483
Just need to find
my Joan Crawford T-shirt.

16:59.218 --> 17:01.554
It's not snooping
if you only read the top page.

17:01.554 --> 17:03.422
That was not the top page.

17:03.422 --> 17:05.591
It was after I opened and closed
the door a couple of times

17:05.591 --> 17:07.894
real fast to make a breeze.

17:07.894 --> 17:09.295
This doctors report,
says you have

17:09.295 --> 17:11.597
a pinched nerve
in your shoulder.

17:11.597 --> 17:13.900
You're supposed to be taking
a break from playing.

17:13.900 --> 17:15.902
'Resting both your arm
and your hand'

17:15.902 --> 17:17.570
to prevent
"Permanent nerve damage."

17:17.570 --> 17:19.438
You know what, the doctor
is just covering his ass.

17:19.438 --> 17:22.041
Wait, it's your ass
I'm worried about.

17:22.041 --> 17:23.442
You have to postpone
that audition.

17:23.442 --> 17:26.045
- I can't do that.
- They'll understand.

17:26.045 --> 17:29.582
They'll move on to the next
person, is what they'll do.

17:29.582 --> 17:32.919
- It's not that important.
- It is exactly that important.

17:34.587 --> 17:37.056
Is there anything else
you've been lying to me about?

17:37.056 --> 17:38.324
No.

17:38.324 --> 17:40.927
When we decided
to be exclusive

17:40.927 --> 17:43.195
honesty was all
I asked you for.

17:47.934 --> 17:49.068
Wait.

17:51.470 --> 17:53.072
There's something that
I wanna talk about that I

17:53.072 --> 17:55.508
that I need to tell you.

17:55.508 --> 17:57.076
[cell phone beeping]

17:58.611 --> 18:00.279
[indistinct chatter]

18:08.554 --> 18:10.456
[dramatic music]

18:29.575 --> 18:31.444
[cell phone beeps]

18:40.186 --> 18:41.454
[cell phone beeps]

18:55.267 --> 18:56.302
Bad time?

18:56.302 --> 18:58.270
Oh, for you? Come on.

18:58.270 --> 19:00.206
It's always the right time.

19:00.206 --> 19:02.208
[indistinct chatter]

19:09.615 --> 19:11.517
[thunder rumbling]

19:14.220 --> 19:16.255
That was the only time,
alright? I swear.

19:16.255 --> 19:18.758
I'm sorry, alright?
I-I, I was stupid.

19:18.758 --> 19:20.760
I admit it. I..

19:20.760 --> 19:23.763
I shoulda stopped it
when it started, but I didn't.

19:23.763 --> 19:26.365
- I'm sorry.
- I so wanna blame the dead guy.

19:26.365 --> 19:27.900
I know what Nolan was like.

19:27.900 --> 19:30.503
I saw him in action and I just
wanted to dump it all on him.

19:30.503 --> 19:32.371
But I can't.

19:32.371 --> 19:33.506
Can I?

19:36.375 --> 19:37.543
I love you, Andrew.

19:38.778 --> 19:39.912
I love you.

19:39.912 --> 19:41.247
- Did you love Nolan?
- No.

19:41.247 --> 19:42.682
- Maybe a little bit?
- No.

19:42.682 --> 19:44.383
'Cause I can guarantee you
he didn't love you

19:44.383 --> 19:45.785
he just wanted to prove that
he could do it.

19:45.785 --> 19:47.920
You know that, right?

19:47.920 --> 19:51.524
You knew that while it was
happening but you did it anyway.

19:51.524 --> 19:53.692
What can I do to fix this?

19:53.692 --> 19:55.161
You've done enough.

19:56.796 --> 19:58.531
- No, where are you going?
- I don't know,

19:58.531 --> 20:00.666
I just can't be here right now.

20:00.666 --> 20:03.536
You asked me to be honest.

20:03.536 --> 20:04.837
You said that
I could tell you anything.

20:04.837 --> 20:05.938
Yeah. Well, that was a mistake.

20:05.938 --> 20:08.274
I over estimated myself..

20:08.274 --> 20:09.542
...and you.

20:12.411 --> 20:13.412
[door slams]

20:14.947 --> 20:16.549
(Mona)
'I don't know what
this list is, but maybe'

20:16.549 --> 20:18.818
'it does have something
to do with Taylor.'

20:18.818 --> 20:21.320
Okay, you and Caitlin have some
personality traits in common

20:21.320 --> 20:23.823
but, who the hell
is Ray Hogadorn?

20:23.823 --> 20:26.425
He's not on the faculty.

20:26.425 --> 20:27.960
He's not a student.

20:27.960 --> 20:29.729
I'm gonna start matching
social security numbers

20:29.729 --> 20:31.197
to names and see
if I can find him.

20:32.865 --> 20:33.966
Hello?

20:33.966 --> 20:35.000
Mona-to-Alison.

20:35.000 --> 20:36.969
Anybody home?

20:36.969 --> 20:39.705
I saw a picture of Emily
and the girls on Insta today.

20:41.574 --> 20:44.477
She stopped wearing
her wedding ring.

20:44.477 --> 20:45.845
So, what does that mean?

20:45.845 --> 20:47.446
She's moved on.

20:47.446 --> 20:50.583
- And you haven't?
- I guess not.

20:50.583 --> 20:54.720
Ali, you moved across
the country.

20:54.720 --> 20:56.856
This tells me that you knew
how it was gonna end.

20:56.856 --> 21:00.793
Yeah. I convinced myself that
I came here with a clean slate.

21:00.793 --> 21:03.529
That I can prove to Emily that
I could live a trustworthy life.

21:03.529 --> 21:05.698
Maybe win her back.

21:05.698 --> 21:08.701
But I realize the truth is..

21:08.701 --> 21:10.803
It was just too hard
to be there close to her

21:10.803 --> 21:12.671
knowing that
we wouldn't be together.

21:15.407 --> 21:18.677
Look, I think
you moved on, Alison.

21:18.677 --> 21:20.412

about being at the library

I thought that we could be

...was that just for us or
meant for the outside world?

He's not just my boyfriend.
I'm in love with him.

26:08.700 --> 26:11.236
Nolan knew about him

26:11.236 --> 26:12.604

so that we could be

was holding over me.

with him now.

But I don't want
to drag him into this.

If I tell him the truth,
he's gonna go after Mason.

will keep him safe?

to Jeremy--
