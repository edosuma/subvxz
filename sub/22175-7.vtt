{\an3}I feel like
the angles of stuff is off.

19:42.247 --> 19:44.016
- No, he's bending his leg.

19:44.082 --> 19:46.985
<i>- I'm so shocked to see</i>
<i>what Rose tattooed--</i>

19:47.052 --> 19:49.488
<i>the fact that the eyes</i>
<i>are so separated.</i>

19:49.555 --> 19:52.457
I would have been
embarrassed to do that tattoo.

19:52.524 --> 19:55.327
<i>[suspenseful music]</i>

19:55.394 --> 19:57.029
- All right. Let's take
a look at these tattoos.

19:57.095 --> 19:59.331
{\an1}Rose, tell me a little bit
about what

19:59.398 --> 20:00.566
you wanted to do here.

20:00.632 --> 20:01.967
- I tried to give you something

20:02.034 --> 20:04.369
<i>that is a little</i>
<i>bit more unique.</i>

20:04.436 --> 20:06.672
- This tattoo isn't finished.

20:06.738 --> 20:11.009
There's no shading in that
bottom band of the headscarf.

20:11.076 --> 20:13.779
- That's one of the things
that I didn't have time to do.

20:13.845 --> 20:15.547
<i>- She has a purple</i>
<i>blotch on her face,</i>

20:15.614 --> 20:16.982
<i>which looks like a bruise.</i>

20:17.049 --> 20:18.584
- I actually kind
of like the purple.

20:18.650 --> 20:21.920
I see that a lot
in color portraiture to kind

20:21.987 --> 20:23.989
<i>of liven up the skin tone.</i>

20:24.056 --> 20:27.059
But the thing that's
killing me--I feel like you

20:27.125 --> 20:28.694
phoned it in on this design.

20:28.760 --> 20:31.363
- The design
part was really hard on me.

20:31.430 --> 20:35.701
This design actually
was drawn in 20 minutes.

20:35.767 --> 20:39.371
- You need to devote more
than 20 minutes of design time.

20:39.438 --> 20:42.641
- I know. In real life,
I will take hours to design--

20:42.708 --> 20:46.745
{\an1}- This is real life. That's
a real tattoo on a real person.

20:46.812 --> 20:50.182
- I know.
- Completely unacceptable.

20:55.253 --> 20:57.656
- Tai, what was your
plan going into this tattoo?

20:57.723 --> 21:00.659
- I wanted something that
would come across as a gypsy

21:00.726 --> 21:02.494
<i>not reading a crystal ball,</i>

21:02.561 --> 21:04.129
<i>but maybe something that</i>
<i>would cross space and time.</i>

21:04.196 --> 21:05.731
- What I appreciate most

21:05.797 --> 21:07.132
<i>is that you cleaned</i>
<i>your line work up.</i>

21:07.199 --> 21:08.767
<i>Those lines are beautiful.</i>

21:08.834 --> 21:11.069
- I love that you
threw a lot of jewelry all over

21:11.136 --> 21:14.139
her headscarf, and I really
like how you threw the little

21:14.206 --> 21:16.441
<i>symbols on the little coins.</i>

21:16.508 --> 21:18.744
It kind of ties
into the jewelry element.

21:18.810 --> 21:20.746
But there are some problems.

21:20.812 --> 21:24.883
That nose--I cannot get
past that flat little edge

21:24.950 --> 21:28.220
that you used to shade the
underside of the nose, because

21:28.286 --> 21:30.756
no one's nose looks like that.

21:30.822 --> 21:32.658
- The headscarf being

21:32.724 --> 21:35.160

21:38.296 --> 21:40.132
There's not
a lot of color harmony.

21:40.198 --> 21:42.467
- What's going on?
Are you nervous?

21:42.534 --> 21:44.503
- Oh, yeah.
This is a huge thing for me

21:44.569 --> 21:46.271
to step out of my comfort zone,

21:46.338 --> 21:48.073
being a very shy and reserved
person to even do this.

21:48.140 --> 21:50.942
- There is nothing
for you to be nervous about.

21:51.009 --> 21:52.811
You should be proud
of yourself for the amount

21:52.878 --> 21:54.913
of time and dedication
that you put into this design.

21:54.980 --> 21:57.182

I'm very happy to be here.

lot to discuss. We'll be back.

22:00.485 --> 22:02.054

22:03.588 --> 22:05.323
{\an3}- What the [bleep] just
happened?

22:05.390 --> 22:07.759
- Rose had the advantage today,
and what did he do?

22:07.826 --> 22:09.094
He threw that [bleep] together

22:09.161 --> 22:10.562
20 minutes before
he came in here?

22:10.629 --> 22:12.130
<i>The composition of this tattoo</i>

22:12.197 --> 22:14.499
<i>is very strange</i>
<i>and very under-thought.</i>

22:14.566 --> 22:17.769
{\an3}- Yeah. But just because we
were angry at how he approached

22:17.836 --> 22:21.206
{\an3}this tattoo does not
make Tai completely safe.

22:21.273 --> 22:23.709
<i>The space didn't</i>
<i>translate like space to me.</i>

22:23.775 --> 22:25.777
<i>It looked like cotton</i>
<i>candy and kind of muddy.</i>

22:25.844 --> 22:28.413
- Well, to be completely fair
and unbiased, I have to say

22:28.480 --> 22:31.049
that even though there was less
of jewelry in Rose's tattoo,

22:31.116 --> 22:34.286
the beads that were
there were done beautifully.

22:34.352 --> 22:37.255
- And I did
like how he did the lips.

22:37.322 --> 22:39.958
- But there was zero contrast.
There was no black.

22:40.025 --> 22:42.828
- But the nose in Tai's
tattoo was not perfect as well.

22:42.894 --> 22:45.464
- They both had issues.

22:45.530 --> 22:47.466
- You dropped
the ball today, man.

22:47.532 --> 22:49.534
That was a pretty rough tattoo.
- They went really easy on you.

22:49.601 --> 22:51.636
Your line work was really,
really raggedy.

22:51.703 --> 22:52.804
- My lines were--my
lines were nice.

22:52.871 --> 22:54.072
- Really?

22:54.139 --> 22:55.874
- They were clean,
they were crisp.

22:55.941 --> 22:58.009
Your woman looked like it
was a splice between an alien

22:58.076 --> 22:59.411
and some other kind of creature

22:59.478 --> 23:00.879
that I've never
even seen before.

23:00.946 --> 23:02.848
- What's up, guys?
Let's do this.

23:02.914 --> 23:05.617
- I think it's bull[bleep]
how you ripped me apart.

23:05.684 --> 23:08.854
- Can you think about
how your canvas feels right now

23:08.920 --> 23:11.923
knowing that you only put
20 minutes into your design?

23:11.990 --> 23:15.193
- That tattoo will
be perfect with, like,

23:15.260 --> 23:19.197
maybe an hour worth of polish.
- Are you serious?

23:19.264 --> 23:22.234
- Unfortunately, we
have a very different opinion.

23:22.300 --> 23:24.770
- Ultimately,
one of you is going to win,

23:24.836 --> 23:26.471
and one of you
will be eliminated.

that Rose, you are eliminated.

{\an1}- The flood started
on Saturday. I was at work.

29:08.113 --> 29:10.515
{\an1}I decided to go ahead
and take a chance and leave.

29:10.582 --> 29:13.651
{\an1}I got two blocks away,
and the current took my car,

29:13.718 --> 29:16.788
{\an1}and then I got
stuck under a bridge.

29:16.855 --> 29:18.323
Within minutes the car was

29:18.389 --> 29:21.092
{\an1}filling up, and the electrical
power was failing.

29:21.159 --> 29:22.727

the windows down.

29:22.794 --> 29:24.362

rising around you.

was out of the car,

29:28.233 --> 29:29.801
but being trapped in the car,

29:29.868 --> 29:31.569
{\an1}and I couldn't get out
of it--that was the scary part.

29:31.636 --> 29:33.705
Eventually, that evening,
two corrections officers

29:33.771 --> 29:35.440
from the facility that I worked

29:35.507 --> 29:38.109

happened to be on the road.

{\an1}stick my umbrella
out of the sunroof.

29:42.947 --> 29:46.518

me around 4:00 in the morning.

<i>- It could be</i>
<i>a personal preference.</i>

38:05.583 --> 38:07.618
<i>- Right.</i>
<i>It's not an execution problem;</i>

38:07.685 --> 38:09.286
<i>it's just a matter of taste.</i>

38:09.353 --> 38:11.856
- Yeah. We're gonna have
a really tough decision.

38:11.922 --> 38:13.624
- Sure. Absolutely.

38:13.691 --> 38:15.526
- It is absolutely
breathtaking.

38:15.593 --> 38:18.195
- Thank you.

38:18.262 --> 38:20.965
{\an3}- While I am impressed
that Tai got so much done

38:21.032 --> 38:23.434
<i>in that amount of time,</i>
<i>there's a lot of issues.</i>

38:23.501 --> 38:26.170
{\an3}When you're rushing yourself,
it's going to get in the way of

38:26.237 --> 38:27.605
the perfection of your tattoo.

38:27.672 --> 38:29.106
- It's so blaringly obvious

38:29.173 --> 38:31.409
{\an1}that the entire
left side is a cover-up.

38:31.475 --> 38:33.210
<i>- Yeah.</i>
<i>- It's thick.</i>

38:33.277 --> 38:35.713
<i>- And I also noticed</i>
<i>that she completely forgot</i>

38:35.780 --> 38:38.015
<i>to line the separation</i>
<i>from one</i>

38:38.082 --> 38:40.017
<i>feather to another</i>
<i>on the right side,</i>

38:40.084 --> 38:42.820
and I think she just maybe bit
off way more than she can chew.

38:42.887 --> 38:46.157
{\an3}Kelly, on the other hand,
had way less details,

38:46.223 --> 38:50.027
<i>but really pulled it</i>
<i>off in every other way.</i>

38:50.094 --> 38:52.630
- It is unbelievable
that Kelly's able to make

38:52.697 --> 38:56.701
it look so packed,
so buttery and beautiful.

38:56.767 --> 38:58.569
- If there's anything
that could have been done

38:58.636 --> 39:00.638
differently, maybe if there was

39:00.705 --> 39:03.808
<i>a really bold line to separate</i>
<i>the tree from the background,</i>

39:03.874 --> 39:06.243
<i>it would have stood</i>
<i>out like her umbrella,</i>

39:06.310 --> 39:08.646
but that's just a small gripe.

39:08.713 --> 39:10.815
- I know.
- Well, let's go let them know.

39:10.881 --> 39:12.650
<i>[suspenseful music]</i>

39:12.717 --> 39:15.052

guys ready to find out who won?

39:15.119 --> 39:18.322
[cheers and applause]

39:20.424 --> 39:23.127

if Tai beats Kelly,

39:23.194 --> 39:27.064
she will secure a spot
on "Ink Master" season ten.

You did so good.

40:20.751 --> 40:23.454
- So yeah, I didn't win,
but coming to this competition

40:23.521 --> 40:25.790
was me confronting a huge fear.

had that in the bag.

<i>Nashville should count itself</i>

40:44.942 --> 40:48.979
lucky that it has

40:49.046 --> 40:52.750
{\an1}It was an absolute delight
getting to compete against you.
