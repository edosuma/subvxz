WEBVTT

00:13.185 --> 00:15.360
And then I looked
after some twins

00:15.739 --> 00:17.534
for a lovely couple in Richmond.

00:18.501 --> 00:20.330
Unfortunately, he died recently.

00:20.882 --> 00:22.815
He had a heart attack
on a trip to Paris.

00:23.471 --> 00:25.163
Oh, I love Paris.

00:25.784 --> 00:28.580
- So, when can you start?
- Oh!

00:28.614 --> 00:30.213
I mean, the sooner,
the better, really, for me.

00:30.237 --> 00:31.800
I mean, I know, I know
this sounds ridiculous,

00:31.824 --> 00:34.068
but, um... if you could start
this afternoon,

00:34.103 --> 00:35.423
that would...
That would be great.

00:36.450 --> 00:39.349
But I... I know
that's ridiculous.

00:39.729 --> 00:42.732
- Is it? Is that ridiculous?
- What, to start, now?

00:42.766 --> 00:45.217
No, no, no, no, no, no.
This afternoon.

00:45.700 --> 00:47.737
Unless you can start now?

00:48.876 --> 00:51.258
Shouldn't I meet
the kids first, or...

00:51.465 --> 00:54.675
Whatever you want.
Um, meet them, don't meet them..

00:54.916 --> 00:58.541
Jesus Christ! Is that the door?

01:05.203 --> 01:07.826
- This is my boyfriend, Luke.
- Oh, hi.

01:08.206 --> 01:09.206
Nice house.

01:10.139 --> 01:11.419
How much did that painting cost?

01:11.692 --> 01:13.176
I dunno...

01:13.211 --> 01:15.011
A lot of nice houses
round here, ain'’t there?

01:16.214 --> 01:18.595
- You coming or what?
- Oh, sorry, we have to go.

01:29.641 --> 01:31.229
So, when can you meet the kids?

01:36.889 --> 01:39.340
No, she just didn't turn up.
I can'’t believe it.

01:39.375 --> 01:41.456
She was perfect in every way,
apart from not turning up.

01:41.480 --> 01:43.482
Now we'’re gonna be late
for school, again.

01:43.517 --> 01:45.415
I mean, I just,
Paul, I don't know

01:45.657 --> 01:47.728
how much more of this
I can take,

01:48.556 --> 01:51.456
I mean, it'’s just...
it's just too much for me.

01:51.490 --> 01:55.322
It's just too much for me, Paul.
Just... it'’s too much.

01:55.632 --> 01:57.151
It's a bit early, isn't it?

01:57.358 --> 01:58.358
I'll just have a Pimm'’s.

01:59.257 --> 02:01.155
Agh! It sounds like hell.

02:01.190 --> 02:04.607
I'm so sorry I had to come
on this bloody stag.

02:05.884 --> 02:07.127
Do you want me to come home?

02:07.334 --> 02:10.268
No, no, no, no, no,
don't come home.

02:10.302 --> 02:13.271
- I'll come home.
- No, no. You know, really don'’t.

02:13.305 --> 02:14.865
I'm coming home.
I'm going to come home.

02:15.721 --> 02:17.492
No, don'’t be silly.
Put those down. Don'’t be silly.

02:17.516 --> 02:20.174
No, look, you need me
and that's that.

02:20.209 --> 02:21.831
- I'm gonna come home.
- Well,

02:22.280 --> 02:24.903
if you're serious,
that would be amazing.

02:25.766 --> 02:27.940
But if I can't come home...

02:27.975 --> 02:30.633
what's
the next best thing I could do?

02:30.667 --> 02:31.634
Oh, I know.

02:31.668 --> 02:34.015
No, no, no, no, no.
Don't send your parents.

02:34.050 --> 02:37.398
They don't help.
They do not help, Paul.

02:37.433 --> 02:40.229
- What? Hey?
- Paul?

02:40.919 --> 02:42.817
- Julia?
- Paul, I said don't send...

02:43.473 --> 02:46.027
your parents, that would be
an absolute disaster.

02:46.062 --> 02:47.615
- Julia.
- Paul.

02:48.064 --> 02:50.515
Julia, the reception here
is shit, I didn't catch

02:50.549 --> 02:53.380
any of what you just said.
But if you can hear me,

02:54.553 --> 02:57.591
don't worry,
I'm going to call my parents.

03:03.700 --> 03:04.700
Julia?

03:06.876 --> 03:08.360
Hey, did you put mint in this?

03:17.714 --> 03:19.544
- Morning.
- Oh, gangway!

03:19.578 --> 03:20.752
- Can't talk.
- Morning.

03:26.447 --> 03:29.347
In, in, in, in. Sorry, sorry,
sorry, I know it's past nine,

03:29.381 --> 03:30.701
but can I just sneak
them through?

03:30.831 --> 03:32.212
Bye-bye, love you,
love you. Bye.

03:37.286 --> 03:38.849
I'm gonna have to mark
them down as late.

03:38.873 --> 03:40.713
Oh, no, please, we can'’t get
another late mark this term,

03:40.737 --> 03:43.361
- it'’s so upsetting for Ivy.
- I have to put them in the book.

03:43.395 --> 03:45.742
Please don't do that. Look,
please don'’t open the book.

03:45.984 --> 03:47.882
Don't pick up the pen.
Just put the pen down.

03:48.400 --> 03:50.782
- Stop writing!
- I have to put them in the book.

03:51.334 --> 03:54.958
Wonderful. Wonderful, wonderful.
Okay, well... thank you very muc

03:54.993 --> 03:58.548
you'’ve been so kind, I hope
you have a marvelous day.

03:58.893 --> 03:59.929
Nice jumper.

04:13.839 --> 04:14.959
Just take whatever you want.

04:16.048 --> 04:18.248
Anything left over is going
to the charity shop. Trevor,

04:18.844 --> 04:20.777
- could I get a latte?
- Only if you're good.

04:23.849 --> 04:25.102
You'll never get
away with that, Anne.

04:25.126 --> 04:26.852
Oh, God, yeah. I was joking.

04:28.785 --> 04:31.271
- Two doughnuts please.
- Sure.

04:33.583 --> 04:35.112
You need to get them
into Breakfast Club,

04:35.136 --> 04:37.829
- miss the traffic that way.
- Breakfast Club? What's that?

04:37.863 --> 04:40.349
Just what it sounds like.
You can drop them off at eight.

04:40.383 --> 04:41.971
I'’m trying to get
Charlie in on it.

04:42.005 --> 04:44.698
He'’s having his half eight poo
in school and I'm back in bed.

04:44.732 --> 04:47.425
What? They give them breakfast?
God, that is great.

04:47.459 --> 04:49.679
I hate doing breakfast. My kids
never know what they want.

04:49.703 --> 04:50.704
What? You ask them?

04:51.187 --> 04:52.982
- Yeah, don't you?
- No!

04:53.741 --> 04:55.167
Just put a bowl
of cornflakes in front of them.

04:55.191 --> 04:56.572
They're not gourmets.

04:57.814 --> 05:00.214
Charlie would eat a bowl of Lego
if I put it in front of him.

05:00.507 --> 05:02.819
God, yeah. Why did I ever think
I have to ask them?

05:03.406 --> 05:05.512
Right, so, how do you get
into Breakfast Club, then?

05:05.546 --> 05:07.721
You need to speak to Mrs. Lamb.
She sorts it all out.

05:07.755 --> 05:09.550
Oh, I love this.

05:09.964 --> 05:11.844
Well, don'’t get too excited,
it'’s last season.

05:12.553 --> 05:14.037
Oh, which teacher
is Mrs. Lamb, again?

05:14.072 --> 05:16.350
No, she's the sour cow
on reception. Can I have this?

05:17.006 --> 05:19.871
Oh, no, I don't think so.

05:20.872 --> 05:21.942
Why not?

05:21.976 --> 05:23.806
Well... I can'’t give
everything away.

05:23.840 --> 05:25.577
They'’ll be nothing left
for the charity shop.

05:25.601 --> 05:26.705
And it's for cancer.

05:28.776 --> 05:32.055
I tell you what, I'’ll give
you a tenner for cancer

05:32.090 --> 05:35.990
and I'’ll throw in my coat
for even more cancer.

05:36.197 --> 05:37.371
That's not a bad deal.

05:39.200 --> 05:40.200
Great.

05:44.171 --> 05:47.519
Oh, yeah, Mrs. Lamb's the man.
Breakfast Club, Homework Club.

05:47.554 --> 05:49.797
Oh, God! I was sort
of off-ish with her earlier.

05:49.832 --> 05:52.213
How bad was it? Was it anything
you could walk back?

05:52.248 --> 05:53.974
Well, I said
that she was very helpful

05:54.008 --> 05:55.631
and I said, "Nice jumper."

05:56.425 --> 05:59.151
Shit.
She responds well to gifts.

05:59.186 --> 06:01.222
I got her a St. Tropez kit
for her birthday,

06:01.257 --> 06:03.097
and now Charlie's allowed
back on school trips.

06:03.846 --> 06:05.468
I feel a bit sorry for her.

06:05.744 --> 06:07.574
You see her around the place
on her own a lot.

06:07.608 --> 06:08.782
Here comes trouble.

06:10.128 --> 06:11.957
You're looking
at a free man, ladies.

06:12.199 --> 06:13.683
What do you mean?

06:13.718 --> 06:15.961
Oh, Jill'’s gone
to her mother's with the kids.

06:15.996 --> 06:17.307
Oh, no, what'’s happened?

06:17.342 --> 06:20.932
Oh, nothing. It'’s just a thing
she has to do from time to time.

06:21.898 --> 06:23.018
When she's had enough of me.

06:23.866 --> 06:25.592
When I'm driving
her up the walls.

06:26.455 --> 06:28.526
She just says, "Ah!

06:29.630 --> 06:32.426
I can't take it!"
and scarpers. So...

06:32.461 --> 06:35.222
Um, what are you guys doing
for the weekend?

06:35.256 --> 06:36.810
A few friends have
invited me to Milan.

06:38.052 --> 06:39.537
- Have they?
- No.

06:39.813 --> 06:42.850
- I've got my in-laws coming...
- Oh.

06:43.575 --> 06:46.647
I call my in-laws,
"the outlaws".

06:46.992 --> 06:47.993
Well, not really.

06:49.236 --> 06:51.790
Well, then. Looks like I've got
a weekend to myself doing

06:51.825 --> 06:54.897
boy stuff in the man cave.
Could be worse.

06:55.622 --> 06:57.209
Actually,
sounds pretty good to me.

06:57.865 --> 07:00.558
Right, well, I better go
and pick them up.

07:00.592 --> 07:02.121
I'’d have to bloody work
from home today

07:02.145 --> 07:05.217
because they don'’t understand,
"Key under flowerpot".

07:05.873 --> 07:07.150
- See you, troops.
- Bye.

07:09.808 --> 07:11.088
You done your hair or something?

07:12.915 --> 07:14.675
Might have treated
myself to a wash.

07:14.882 --> 07:16.815
Whatever you did, it's working.

07:20.509 --> 07:21.789
I should wash myself more often.

07:25.341 --> 07:28.724
I can'’t park here! Wait there,
I'll bring the car around!

07:28.758 --> 07:32.106
- We're coming! We'’re coming!
- No, no, no, don't!

07:33.107 --> 07:34.246
Oh.

07:35.385 --> 07:37.595
Wait a minute, we haven'’t got
all the bags. Where...

07:37.802 --> 07:39.838
- Where...
- Oh, for goodness sake, look.

07:39.873 --> 07:41.599
Oh.

07:41.633 --> 07:44.291
- Oh, God!
- Oh, Julia.

07:46.017 --> 07:47.639
- Oh.
- Come on, come on.

07:50.124 --> 07:52.713
- Where'’s my paper? My newspaper?
- Oh, Geoff, please!

07:52.748 --> 07:53.956
I left it up the stairs.

07:53.990 --> 07:55.071
- Must've been...
- Just stay there.

07:55.095 --> 07:57.062
Yes, well, go on,
hurry up, hurry up, hurry up.

07:58.305 --> 08:01.135
- Oh, look! Look, I'’ve got it.
- Oh, for goodness sake,

08:01.170 --> 08:02.861
- come on then, let'’s go.
- All right.

08:04.863 --> 08:06.244
Oh!

08:18.394 --> 08:21.017
The cavalry have arrived.

08:26.678 --> 08:28.887
- There you go.
- What'’s this?

08:28.922 --> 08:31.096
Uh, closing early,
only throw them away, otherwise.

08:31.338 --> 08:33.202
Oh, thanks.

08:43.868 --> 08:46.664
Yes, thank you. She's letting
you through, Julia.

08:46.871 --> 08:47.975
She's letting you through.

08:48.010 --> 08:50.115
Thank you, Elizabeth,
Yes, I know what this means.

08:51.289 --> 08:53.774
Oh, oh!

08:53.809 --> 08:56.156
She thinks you're waving
her through, now.

08:56.190 --> 08:58.745
Yes, yes.
Sorry, you go, you go.

09:08.237 --> 09:10.135
How are my two darlings?

09:10.964 --> 09:12.251
They're not in the car,
Elizabeth.

09:12.275 --> 09:15.071
- They're at school, remember?
- Oh, yes, of course.

09:15.416 --> 09:16.797
You all right back there, Geoff?

09:17.177 --> 09:18.592
I am, thank you, Julia.

09:20.421 --> 09:21.940
Do you know who used
to live here?

09:21.975 --> 09:24.218
- Who?
- Michael Caine.

09:24.253 --> 09:26.369
Michael Caine? Really?
He used to live in Queen'’s Park?

09:26.393 --> 09:28.257
No, no, no, no, London.

09:30.017 --> 09:32.606
Did you get anything nice
for Christmas?

09:32.641 --> 09:35.851
- They're not in the car.
- Oh, yes.

09:37.922 --> 09:40.994
- Oh, where are they?
- They're at school.

09:41.339 --> 09:44.653
Oh, yes, yes. Oh, careful
with that one, Julia.

09:44.687 --> 09:46.033
We don't want to break it,
do we?

09:47.863 --> 09:49.312
Do you want to take
your coats off?

09:49.934 --> 09:51.176
I'm a bit cold.

09:51.383 --> 09:53.903
- Oh, I can put the heating on?
- No, no.

09:54.248 --> 09:56.043
I'’ll just keep my coat on.

09:58.218 --> 10:00.323
How about a nice cup of tea
and a catch up?

10:00.358 --> 10:02.118
Oh, okay. You want tea.

10:03.119 --> 10:04.638
Great. I'll put the kettle on.

10:05.363 --> 10:07.814
- Do you want one, Geoff?
- Huh? Uh,

10:07.848 --> 10:09.528
well, only if you're putting
the kettle on.

10:09.712 --> 10:10.712
I am, yeah.

10:12.681 --> 10:14.959
Actually, could I have
a coffee, rather?

10:15.338 --> 10:16.892
Coffee. Absolutely.

10:17.099 --> 10:18.997
Have you got
a small piece of bread?

10:19.308 --> 10:22.449
I haven't had breakfast.
Just the heel will be fine.

10:23.726 --> 10:25.141
- Just the heel?
- Yes.

10:25.521 --> 10:26.902
Don'’t waste a proper slice.

10:38.327 --> 10:39.880
I thought it might be fun

10:39.915 --> 10:42.676
if you guys picked up the kids
from school? Surprise them?

10:42.883 --> 10:45.783
I'’ve a bit of work to get
on with. You can take my car.

10:45.990 --> 10:48.820
Oh. I don't like driving
in London.

10:49.476 --> 10:51.789
- I'’ll ask Geoff.
- Toilet's broken.

10:51.996 --> 10:53.756
Oh, don't worry,
I'll take care of it.

10:53.791 --> 10:55.827
- No, don'’t...
- Julia was wondering

10:55.862 --> 10:57.760
if we could pick
up the children from school.

10:57.795 --> 10:59.866
Oh well, I'd better get
on with the toilet,

10:59.900 --> 11:01.868
especially if I'm not going
to miss the rugby.

11:01.902 --> 11:03.902
- Don'’t worry about the toilet.
- It'’s all right.

11:04.491 --> 11:08.253
Yes, best we don't.
Oh, before you go, Julia,

11:08.288 --> 11:11.394
could you get out a deckchair
so I can sit in the garden?

11:44.876 --> 11:48.086
You leaving us, Barbara?
Can you take me with you?

11:57.302 --> 12:00.064
I mean, they can'’t even make
a cup of tea themselves.

12:01.134 --> 12:03.895
They'’d die of dehydration
if I didn't come home.

12:03.930 --> 12:06.277
- Bless them.
- And they're so cheap.

12:06.622 --> 12:08.520
They won't let anything
go to waste.

12:08.555 --> 12:10.971
Geoff even ate
a rancid mango today,

12:11.006 --> 12:12.835
rather than throw it away.

12:12.870 --> 12:15.596
My dad drives two miles
further away from the local shop

12:15.631 --> 12:17.150
to get cheaper bin bags.

12:17.391 --> 12:20.981
- How old?
- How old? I don't know, Kevin.

12:21.016 --> 12:23.535
- Late sixties?
- Oh, that's a lovely age.

12:23.570 --> 12:24.951
- Can I meet them?
- What?

12:25.468 --> 12:26.573
Can I meet them?

12:26.607 --> 12:29.749
You want to meet
my husband's parents? Why?

12:29.956 --> 12:32.372
I love old people.
I used to work with old people

12:32.406 --> 12:34.477
when I was at uni.
Best years of my life.

12:36.341 --> 12:39.068
People tell me I'm very much
like an old person sometimes.

12:39.620 --> 12:41.243
Um, no. That'’s weird, Kevin.

12:45.661 --> 12:47.836
- What are you doing?
- Just got flirted at again.

12:48.077 --> 12:49.838
- Flirted at by who?
- Trevor.

12:50.424 --> 12:53.151
- He winked at me.
- Oh, my God.

12:53.186 --> 12:55.050
This café is the only place
I have now

12:55.084 --> 12:56.534
and you are going
to make it weird.

12:56.568 --> 12:57.915
How am I going to make it weird?

13:01.642 --> 13:03.334
Oh, for God'’s sake.

13:09.064 --> 13:11.549
Geoff! I'’ve got your Rennies!

13:11.583 --> 13:14.103
Ah, thank you! Oh, now...

13:14.932 --> 13:16.372
don't you worry
about this, Julia,

13:16.692 --> 13:19.591
I managed to turn
the water off, eventually.

13:20.627 --> 13:23.112
But I did remember
to fill up the kettle

13:23.147 --> 13:25.528
so, if you wouldn't mind
just going and popping it on?

13:26.081 --> 13:28.083
Geoff, Geoff, will I tell her?

13:28.117 --> 13:30.130
- Or do you want to tell her?
- Just tell me, Elizabeth.

13:30.154 --> 13:32.121
You tell me before I execute
both of you.

13:32.156 --> 13:35.297
Well, we were going to save it
until Paul got home, but...

13:36.091 --> 13:37.955
- Sit down, Julia.
- I don'’t want to sit down.

13:38.921 --> 13:40.889
Well, Paul has told us

13:40.923 --> 13:43.039
how difficult you'’re finding
things at the moment, you know,

13:43.063 --> 13:45.238
since your mother
stopped doing everything for you

13:45.479 --> 13:48.897
and we'’ve seen first-hand
how overwhelmed you are,

13:49.242 --> 13:51.002
so we'’ve decided...

13:52.279 --> 13:54.557
to move back to London. Hmm.

13:55.179 --> 13:57.457
So we won't be just at the end
of the phone any more.

13:57.491 --> 13:59.942
We'’ll be right here.
All the time.

14:00.253 --> 14:01.944
You'll be able to sit back

14:01.979 --> 14:04.326
and let us take care
of everything.

14:04.360 --> 14:07.501
Elizabeth,
it'’s time for my pill.

14:07.536 --> 14:09.434
- Uh. Uh.
- Where are my pills?

14:09.469 --> 14:11.160
Oh, they'’re in the car.
I'’ll get them.

14:11.471 --> 14:14.405
I'’ll get them! I need something
anyway. I'’ll get the pills.

14:29.213 --> 14:30.421
Barbara,

14:30.766 --> 14:33.079
have you seen this?
Somebody must have...

14:33.734 --> 14:35.391
I ran over as soon as I...

14:36.323 --> 14:37.462
Never mind.

14:38.532 --> 14:40.372
I know, I'’ll get,
I'll get Paul to put it back

14:40.465 --> 14:42.571
as soon as he's home
from his stag.

14:43.020 --> 14:44.573
How did they do that?

14:44.953 --> 14:46.333
It was buried...

14:47.058 --> 14:48.163
very deep.

14:48.197 --> 14:50.717
Desperate people are capable
of anything, Barbara.

14:54.134 --> 14:55.929
You have
called the Brady residence.

14:55.964 --> 14:58.276
Please leave a short message
after the beep.

14:58.656 --> 15:01.279
Or if you like, you can
message me on Tumblr.

15:01.314 --> 15:02.556
Hi, Kevin,

15:02.971 --> 15:04.627
uh, if you'’re still
at a loose end...

15:05.249 --> 15:07.044
- Hello?
- Hi. Kevin.

15:08.321 --> 15:12.014
I have reached the limits
of my endurance.

15:12.394 --> 15:14.603
I am taking them out to eat,

15:15.431 --> 15:18.469
so, if the offer still stands,

15:18.503 --> 15:21.679
could you please come and do
some geriatric whispering.

15:21.713 --> 15:24.164
I'’d love to.
When do you want me? Now?

15:24.199 --> 15:26.270
I could come now?
Would you like me to come now?

15:29.307 --> 15:31.344
You know what, let'’s go out,
let'’s go out to eat.

15:31.378 --> 15:34.036
- What? Where?
- To a... To a restaurant?

15:34.416 --> 15:37.143
- Oh, whose birthday is it?
- No, it'’s no-one's birthday.

15:37.177 --> 15:38.661
Well, what will I wear?

15:39.352 --> 15:42.320
Just... what? Just... casual.
Casual clothes.

15:42.355 --> 15:44.022
I'’m not sure
I'’ve got any casual clothes.

15:44.046 --> 15:45.392
Geoff, Geoff! We're going out!

15:46.773 --> 15:49.672
No, no, no! Spit that out!
That is not a biscuit.

15:50.259 --> 15:54.988
- Geoff is this your hearing aid?
- Oh, there it is.

15:55.023 --> 15:56.162
We're going out.

16:04.653 --> 16:08.312
Julia, why did you let him
put my hearing aid in his mouth?

16:09.278 --> 16:11.246
This was the best one
I ever had, you know and...

16:12.523 --> 16:14.456
Well now, I...
I can't hear a thing.

16:15.388 --> 16:17.286
- Oh, Elizabeth, say something.
- Uh.

16:17.769 --> 16:21.290
Testing. Testing. Testing
Geoff'’s hearing aid.

16:21.670 --> 16:26.468
Alpha, Bravo, Charlie,
Delta, Echo.

16:26.744 --> 16:28.228
Oh, there's Kevin!

16:35.235 --> 16:37.444
Geoff! Geoff, it's okay!
It's my friend!

16:37.479 --> 16:39.757
- This is my friend.
- Hello.

16:44.900 --> 16:47.489
Geoff and Elizabeth. Got it.

16:48.869 --> 16:50.802
Weren't names lovely
in the past?

16:51.700 --> 16:53.736
- What do you mean?
- Hmm?

16:53.771 --> 16:57.119
- What do you mean in the past?
- Oh, I see.

16:57.154 --> 16:59.673
It's almost like I'm saying
you belong in the past.

16:59.708 --> 17:01.330
I'm... I'm not at all.

17:01.365 --> 17:03.436
We're here now, aren't we?
We're not dead yet.

17:03.470 --> 17:05.231
No, indeed.

17:05.265 --> 17:08.130
Very much still with us
and thank goodness for that.

17:10.270 --> 17:12.859
Oh, these are heated seats,
aren't they, Julia?

17:14.205 --> 17:16.380
You're spoiling
the backseat boys here.

17:16.587 --> 17:18.658
Isn't she, Geoff?
Do you feel that, Geoff?

17:19.624 --> 17:21.040
Lovely and warm.

17:22.524 --> 17:25.320
Lovely and warm. The seats.

17:26.114 --> 17:27.494
Warm your bum up!

17:28.323 --> 17:29.323
Oh!

17:30.118 --> 17:31.360
Are you all right, Geoffrey?

17:31.395 --> 17:33.121
What are you doing
to him, Kevin?

17:33.155 --> 17:34.639
I... I'm not doing
anything to him.

17:41.646 --> 17:44.166
I thought you said you were like
Paul O'Grady with old people?

17:44.201 --> 17:46.824
Just got off on the wrong foot.
I'll win them over, don't worry.

17:46.858 --> 17:48.308
Would you like children's menus?

17:48.343 --> 17:49.343
Yes. No!

17:51.449 --> 17:54.245
I will choose for them.
They will have...

17:55.350 --> 17:56.730
fish pie.

17:57.835 --> 18:01.356
Hmm, dear. Oh, no...

18:01.390 --> 18:02.670
Is there something
about the menu

18:02.702 --> 18:03.817
that bothers you, Elizabeth?

18:03.841 --> 18:05.705
Well, is there anything
other than fish?

18:05.739 --> 18:06.739
Are you...

18:09.398 --> 18:12.229
- Why didn't you say before?
- I didn't want to be a bother.

18:12.608 --> 18:14.507
Excuse me, excuse me,
I'’m so sorry,

18:14.541 --> 18:15.922
is there something
that's not fish?

18:16.405 --> 18:18.235
Uh, well,
it's a fish restaurant.

18:18.269 --> 18:19.469
I know it's a fish restaurant.

18:20.582 --> 18:24.137
Um, the surf and turf?
We can take away the... surf.

18:24.517 --> 18:25.759
Elizabeth? They have steak.

18:25.794 --> 18:27.634
- I don't like steak.
- She doesn't like steak.

18:28.245 --> 18:29.901
It'’s all very expensive.

18:32.318 --> 18:34.147
I... I'll just have
the breadsticks.

18:34.182 --> 18:36.460
Geoff? Geoff?

18:36.494 --> 18:38.358
Do you think you should
just have a main?

18:38.393 --> 18:40.843
Skip the starter,
because of your indigestion?

18:40.878 --> 18:43.846
Yes, yes, I'll have a starter.
What do they have?

18:43.881 --> 18:45.641
Get some lovely grub in there!

18:46.263 --> 18:48.886
- Who is he?
- This is Kevin.

18:51.923 --> 18:53.270
That'’s Mrs. Lamb over there.

18:53.891 --> 18:56.859
Oh, yes. On her own again,
poor thing.

18:57.412 --> 18:59.207
Excuse me, excuse me?
Hi, I'’m so sorry.

18:59.448 --> 19:01.381
I'’m so sorry, you see
that woman over there?

19:01.416 --> 19:03.314
I... I'll pick up her bill.
You can tell her.

19:03.728 --> 19:05.247
Oh. Okay, yeah.

19:18.018 --> 19:19.710
- Lovely to see you.
- How are you?

19:20.435 --> 19:22.678
Nice meeting you.
Oh, thank you very much.

19:22.713 --> 19:24.370
- Oh, come on.
- How are you?

19:24.404 --> 19:25.724
Can we have
the wine list, please?

19:45.529 --> 19:46.875
I don't believe it.

19:47.841 --> 19:50.016
Everyone's been talking
about her like she's a recluse.

19:50.050 --> 19:53.433
It's like Ant and Dec's Saturday
Night Takeawayover there.

19:54.641 --> 19:57.748
Excuse me. Look.
Can you tell me again

19:58.266 --> 20:01.717
how you know my daughter-in-law?
Who are you?

20:02.097 --> 20:03.097
Well, we'’re...

20:05.652 --> 20:07.654
I don'’t want to say
more than friends

20:08.448 --> 20:10.554
but we are very close.

20:29.711 --> 20:32.265
I think it'’s your pilot light,
that'’s the problem.

20:32.300 --> 20:34.992
Right. Well, it's not worked
properly since you installed it.

20:35.026 --> 20:37.097
- Oh, really?
- Yeah, really.

20:37.132 --> 20:38.306
Well, I'’m sorry about that.

20:40.825 --> 20:41.825
Nice coat.

20:49.144 --> 20:51.526
- Jesus, you reek.
- I've been working, haven't I?

20:52.596 --> 20:55.564
Yeah, you were fixing a boiler,
not wrestling a B.O. machine.

20:58.360 --> 21:00.673
- No, no, no. Leave it on.
- What?

21:00.983 --> 21:02.847
- The coat. Leave it on.
- What?

21:04.504 --> 21:07.542
Stop. Stop. The kid.

21:07.783 --> 21:09.958
- Daddy!
- Hello mate!

21:10.165 --> 21:12.926
Oh, look at you.
What are we gonna do with you?

21:13.133 --> 21:16.965
- What about this?
- Stop it!

21:16.999 --> 21:18.656
Don't shake him like a can
of coke, Lee.

21:18.691 --> 21:20.520
You don't have to mop
up the mess.

21:20.796 --> 21:23.696
You gonna throw up for Mummy?
Throw up for Mummy, go on!

21:25.801 --> 21:27.113
Are you gonna throw
up for Mummy?

21:27.147 --> 21:28.735
All right. Oh, come back here.

21:30.806 --> 21:33.050
What'’s been happening?
You good? Yeah?

21:36.018 --> 21:37.365
I didn't want fish pie.

21:37.399 --> 21:39.643
That'’s all there is, okay,
shush it down.

21:39.677 --> 21:41.921
Hello, yes, I just want to make
it absolutely clear

21:42.473 --> 21:45.062
that I am only getting
dinner for her.

21:45.096 --> 21:47.754
- Not for everybody else.
- Right,

21:47.789 --> 21:49.791
but that puts me in
a very uncomfortable position.

21:49.825 --> 21:50.826
Ah, it'’s a lobster.

21:52.587 --> 21:54.761
- Can you tell her?
- Me tell her I'm not paying

21:54.796 --> 21:56.729
for the meal? No, that would...

21:57.039 --> 21:58.524
Y... You tell her.

21:59.214 --> 22:01.872
Look, just subtract
her meal from the bill

22:01.906 --> 22:04.530
and then point at me
like you did the first time.

22:04.771 --> 22:06.980
Then she'll know
and it won't look like

22:07.015 --> 22:08.568
we're suddenly changing
our minds.

22:08.982 --> 22:11.399
- We're changing our minds?
- Yes, yes, yes, yeah,

22:11.433 --> 22:12.710
because you're part of it,

22:13.987 --> 22:16.347
uh, because you agreed to make
the offer in the first place.

22:16.680 --> 22:19.648
This is the only way.
Don'’t bail on me now.

22:26.068 --> 22:28.692
And there'’s no
"you left the seat up" politics,

22:28.726 --> 22:30.659
because I now pee sitting down.

22:31.488 --> 22:33.766
Now, I don'’t know
why more men don'’t do it.

22:34.594 --> 22:36.493
Geoff?
Oh. He'’s asleep.

22:37.839 --> 22:40.359
Who is this man, Julia?

22:50.265 --> 22:55.028
Uh, excuse me, didn'’t you say
that you were paying for dinner?

22:55.063 --> 22:57.065
- Yes. Yes.
- Well, he's saying you didn't.

22:57.099 --> 22:59.170
Oh!

22:59.964 --> 23:04.555
There's been...
I think you've misunderstood me.

23:05.176 --> 23:09.008
I definitely do want to pay
for the whole dinner.

23:09.249 --> 23:10.527
Not just her.

23:11.804 --> 23:14.738
Sorry, I obviously
didn't make that clear.

23:15.255 --> 23:16.498
Thank you.

23:31.306 --> 23:32.306
No.

23:33.584 --> 23:34.584
No.

23:38.313 --> 23:39.313
They're wonderful.

23:50.912 --> 23:52.154
Oh, God!

23:56.607 --> 23:59.161
- Bye!
- Bye. Bye.

23:59.852 --> 24:01.474
Two hundred and forty quid,
that cost me.

24:01.819 --> 24:04.891
- How did you even manage it?
- Oh, you know, I have my ways.

24:04.926 --> 24:06.824
Anyway, back to bed.
I'’ll see you later.

24:06.859 --> 24:07.859
See you.

24:15.902 --> 24:18.974
Go on. Get inside.

24:20.044 --> 24:23.634
- Don't want to miss your train.
- Oh, hang on a minute! Hang on.

24:23.669 --> 24:24.669
Oh, no.

24:26.844 --> 24:29.295
Look, I'll let you know
how the house hunting goes.

24:29.709 --> 24:33.299
But, in the meantime, any time
it gets too much for you,

24:33.333 --> 24:36.026
- you know what to do.
- You bet, I do.

24:37.096 --> 24:38.994
- Bye.
- Come on, Elizabeth, come on.

24:42.998 --> 24:44.724
- Have you got the tickets?
- What?

24:45.000 --> 24:47.762
- Have you got the tickets?
- What?

24:47.796 --> 24:50.281
Oh, Geoff, never mind.
Never mind.

24:50.765 --> 24:53.699
Get in there. Get in.

24:54.320 --> 24:56.495
Get in the station.

24:58.255 --> 24:59.498
Yes!

25:11.302 --> 25:12.302
Hi.

25:16.135 --> 25:18.137
- It's happened again.
- Aw, thanks.

25:49.306 --> 25:50.963
- Hello, Kevin.
- Amanda.

25:51.653 --> 25:52.999
What'’s going on with you two?

25:53.034 --> 25:54.898
- Are you lost?
- No, I was just passing.

25:55.139 --> 25:56.347
It'’s private. I can't.

25:57.314 --> 25:58.833
Holy shit, it'’s Anne.

25:58.867 --> 26:00.110
Why'’s she got all those kids?

26:00.317 --> 26:03.251
She'’s part of a carpool
now for school drops.

26:03.285 --> 26:05.356
Carpool. Car...
Why don'’t we have a carpool?

26:05.391 --> 26:07.393
- That would really help me.
- I got terribly into

26:07.427 --> 26:09.360
driftwood crafting
after my early menopause.

26:09.706 --> 26:11.846
Well, what you lost in estrogen,

26:11.880 --> 26:13.360
you definitely made
up for in hobbies.

26:14.296 --> 26:15.929
You haven'’t said anything
to Anne, have you?

26:15.953 --> 26:17.610
Oh no. Oh, God, no.

26:17.645 --> 26:19.888
You are on the make
the whole time Julia.

26:19.923 --> 26:21.245
The only reason
you'’re here tonight

26:21.269 --> 26:24.099
- is 'cause you wanted something.
- No. Well, yeah.

26:24.134 --> 26:26.377
Johnny wanted to take
control of his jealousy.

26:26.757 --> 26:28.138
- Are we even friends?
- What?

26:28.483 --> 26:30.243
He is horribly jealous,

26:30.278 --> 26:33.799
but at the same time, he enjoys
watching me with another man.

26:33.833 --> 26:35.766
Of course. Wha... What?
