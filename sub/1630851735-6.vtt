00:09.958 --> 00:14.791
Trouble on the horizon today,
as believers in the flat-Earth theory

00:14.875 --> 00:17.500
protested outside
the National Air and Space Museum.

00:17.583 --> 00:19.166
-Ah!

00:19.250 --> 00:21.875
The Earth's not round! It is flat!

00:21.958 --> 00:24.125
We are here to protest that!

00:24.208 --> 00:26.875
My God, this flat-Earth nonsense.

00:26.958 --> 00:29.250
Why do conspiracies keep getting stupider?

00:29.333 --> 00:31.250
If they only knew the obvious truth.

00:31.333 --> 00:32.875
The Earth isn't flat. It's hollow

00:32.958 --> 00:36.791
and filled with mole people, sea monsters,
and that family from Land of the Lost.

00:36.875 --> 00:38.708
They don't know
about the mole people?

00:38.791 --> 00:42.041
This is what happens
when schools cut science funding.

00:42.125 --> 00:43.083
-Sad.

00:43.166 --> 00:47.208
You fail me again, and I find out
where your family lives.

00:47.291 --> 00:49.541
-Florists, am I right?

00:49.625 --> 00:51.625
Thank God my mom's wedding is tonight.

00:51.708 --> 00:54.041
I'm so sick of planning this thing.

00:54.125 --> 00:56.000
Oh, I love weddings.

00:56.083 --> 01:00.333
They're a celebration of two souls
who got sick of dating apps and settled.

01:00.416 --> 01:03.500
That's the kicker.
My mom is getting married to herself.

01:03.583 --> 01:06.916
Oh,
that's two Tamikos on the invite.

01:07.000 --> 01:09.708
I just thought your mom was a lesbian
and I was racist.

01:09.791 --> 01:11.083
My mom marrying herself

01:11.166 --> 01:13.958
is just another dramatic stunt
to piss off my dad.

01:14.041 --> 01:16.291
That's why I've been working
on an active cover-up.

01:16.958 --> 01:20.041
My dad finds out about this wedding,
it'll be total chaos.

01:21.041 --> 01:23.541
Well, the rest of us are stoked
for a cruise under the stars

01:23.625 --> 01:25.083
on J.R.'s super-yacht.

01:25.166 --> 01:28.500
Please, Brett, mega-yacht.
We have an onboard horse track.

01:28.583 --> 01:30.208
And I volunteer to be security.

01:30.291 --> 01:34.083
I spent my own wedding doing
cavity searches of suspicious guests.

01:34.166 --> 01:36.375
Turns out we didn't even need a registry.

01:36.458 --> 01:38.916
See, Reagan? Weddings are magical.

01:39.000 --> 01:41.041
Stop worrying about your parents
and have some fun.

01:41.125 --> 01:44.583
Fun? You have no idea
what my parents are capable of.

01:44.666 --> 01:48.250
One of their arguments had a ripple effect
that caused the LA riots.

01:48.333 --> 01:49.583
I just need to get through this,

01:49.666 --> 01:53.041
'cause as soon as we re-dock,
I'm on the next flight to Bora-Bora.

01:53.125 --> 01:55.625
Old Reagorino's gonna lay on a beach

01:55.708 --> 01:59.250
and enjoy having blood pressure
in the recommended range.

02:00.083 --> 02:01.125
Brett, a word.

02:01.208 --> 02:04.708
Despite my sunny demeanor,
I am not doing this for fun.

02:04.791 --> 02:06.833
My yacht is a money pit.

02:06.916 --> 02:09.458
The maintenance costs
are about to drag me down into the…

02:09.541 --> 02:11.291
…0.2%.

02:11.375 --> 02:14.333
-No, J.R. Don't say that. No!

02:14.416 --> 02:17.250
My plan is to sell it
to one of the fat cats at the wedding,

02:17.333 --> 02:19.500
so I need you to stoke the fires

02:19.583 --> 02:22.583
by posing as a billionaire
who's interested in buying it.

02:22.666 --> 02:24.041
A solo mission?

02:24.125 --> 02:25.833
Yes. And if you pull this off,

02:25.916 --> 02:28.666
I will give you an enthusiastic "attaboy."

02:28.750 --> 02:31.500
J.R., that… that's too much.

02:31.583 --> 02:34.250
Anchors up at 4 p.m., guys. Don't be late.

02:34.333 --> 02:36.000
Everything needs to be perfect.

02:36.083 --> 02:37.416
Oh, you need a massage.

02:37.500 --> 02:40.291
-Oh, her mind! The rage! The terror!

02:40.375 --> 02:43.791
Oh, we live on the edge of a knife!
This wedding could doom us all!

02:49.958 --> 02:53.458
BT-dubs, if anyone needs it,
I know how to do a bow tie.

03:17.708 --> 03:19.875
I saw your protest on the news.

03:19.958 --> 03:23.541
You really showed
those globalists who's boss.

03:23.625 --> 03:26.666
After years of being ridiculed
for our beliefs,

03:26.750 --> 03:30.750
it's so nice to have someone on our side
that's a respected scientist

03:30.833 --> 03:33.000
and not just a respected NBA player.

03:33.083 --> 03:36.125
Yeah, I'm choking on respect.

03:36.208 --> 03:40.750
Oh man, don't leave the house.
It's really coming down out there.

03:40.833 --> 03:43.875
I got us groceries
so we can stay inside all weekend.

03:43.958 --> 03:47.250
Reagan, meet the DC chapter
of the Flat Earth Society.

03:48.958 --> 03:51.208
They, uh, haven't seen a girl in a while.

03:51.291 --> 03:54.375
Why are you in a chat room
with a bunch of flat-earthers?

03:55.291 --> 03:57.541
A few years back, I made a bet with J.R.

03:57.625 --> 04:01.541
there was no idea so dumb that people
couldn't be made to believe it.

04:01.625 --> 04:05.250
So I spread the flat-Earth theory,
and it worked too well.

04:05.333 --> 04:07.833
Now I just egg them on to piss off J.R.

04:07.916 --> 04:12.416
Well, that sounds like a fun distraction
for the next 72 hours.

04:12.500 --> 04:14.625
Oh, an overnight mission?

04:14.708 --> 04:17.458
Oh my goodness,
looks like work all weekend for me.

04:17.541 --> 04:20.041
You stay here and get cozy. Okay, bye!

04:20.750 --> 04:22.250
So as I was saying,

04:22.333 --> 04:25.708
the true shape of the Earth
can be seen in this secret documentary,

04:25.791 --> 04:27.208
Bruce Almighty.

04:27.291 --> 04:29.375
-Oh, yeah, of course.
-Oh!

04:34.416 --> 04:38.208
All right, he bought the fake storm, boys,
so he's not going anywhere.

04:38.291 --> 04:40.500
All clear.
We intercepted the wedding invitation.

04:40.583 --> 04:41.916
Enjoy your mom's big day.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.208
Enjoy it?

04:58.958 --> 05:00.375
Welcome, everyone.

05:00.458 --> 05:04.166
Me and I thank you all
so much for coming.

05:04.250 --> 05:06.250
Mom, I need you upstairs in 20.

05:06.333 --> 05:08.583
Darling, must you wear
this hideous headset?

05:08.666 --> 05:12.500
The energy of the day is joy,
not fast-food drive-through.

05:12.583 --> 05:15.500
Mom, I'm basically at work here.
I need to stay on point.

05:15.583 --> 05:18.583
Just promise me you'll let go
and live a little.

05:18.666 --> 05:20.375
I'm not just doing this for me.

05:20.458 --> 05:23.041
You're not just marrying yourself
for yourself?

05:23.125 --> 05:25.416
I'm doing it for you too, darling.

05:25.500 --> 05:29.000
To show you how much better life can be
when you serve yourself.

05:29.083 --> 05:30.833
Anyway, serve our guests.

05:30.916 --> 05:31.791
Ugh.

05:33.708 --> 05:35.791
-Open your bags.
-Nothing bad in here.

05:35.875 --> 05:37.500
Just tons of illegal drugs.

05:38.500 --> 05:39.875
No problem, buddy.

05:41.500 --> 05:44.083
No! Oh God! No!

05:47.208 --> 05:49.125
Wow.

05:49.208 --> 05:52.250
Oh my God, I love you guys.

05:52.333 --> 05:55.291
Protocol is protocol.
This is a clean event.

05:55.375 --> 05:56.375
Uh, no worries.

05:56.458 --> 05:59.291
I'm as fun clean as I am wasted,
uh, just a little different.

05:59.375 --> 06:00.833
Huh, I've never seen you sober.

06:00.916 --> 06:03.833
This should be either interesting
or profoundly uninteresting.

06:03.916 --> 06:06.083
Either way, it's gonna be interesting!

06:06.166 --> 06:07.375
-Put the helium down.

06:07.458 --> 06:08.750
Hey! Hey!

06:09.625 --> 06:12.166
Excuse me, sir,
I'm gonna have to ask you to step aside.

06:12.250 --> 06:13.416
Hey, buddy, I do

06:13.500 --> 06:15.750
the vaguely threatening requests
around here.

06:15.833 --> 06:18.333
Glenn, I hired my own security.

06:18.416 --> 06:20.041
With all these VIPs around,

06:20.125 --> 06:22.666
I… I needed someone in peak form.

06:22.750 --> 06:24.666
What do you mean, "peak form"?

06:27.583 --> 06:28.458
Oh!

06:30.083 --> 06:32.791
See? I just took out a waiter
from 30 feet.

06:32.875 --> 06:34.291
I'm combat-ready.

06:34.375 --> 06:36.041
Why don't you enjoy the party

06:36.125 --> 06:38.625
and treat yourself
to a bucket of raw shrimp?

06:40.375 --> 06:42.333
The SS Atlas Shrugged

06:42.416 --> 06:46.541
is the yacht that made Bernie Sanders
vomit on live TV.

06:47.541 --> 06:52.500
But I find one onboard vineyard limiting,
so I'm thinking of selling the old gal.

06:52.583 --> 06:53.708
You know, every month…

06:53.791 --> 06:55.416
Color me intrigued.

06:55.500 --> 06:58.583
-Charmed to meet you all.

06:58.666 --> 07:02.458
I'm Joffrey Game of Thrones,
and these are my monocles.

07:02.541 --> 07:03.916
Brett, what are you doing?

07:04.000 --> 07:06.916
I told you to look like a billionaire,
not Mr. Peanut.

07:07.000 --> 07:10.125
I'm helping you sell the yacht.
I did a lot of character work.

07:10.208 --> 07:11.541
I'm a spoiled prince

07:11.625 --> 07:15.000
whose mom and dad
are actually brother and sister.

07:15.083 --> 07:17.333
Stop it!
Now, get out of that ridiculous costume

07:17.416 --> 07:18.875
before you embarrass me in front of--

07:23.583 --> 07:25.458
Same-day delivery.

07:27.375 --> 07:28.625
Jeff Bezos.

07:28.708 --> 07:31.250
The richest man in the world.

07:31.333 --> 07:33.041
-What do you think of my yacht?
-Well, it's--

07:33.125 --> 07:35.333
Too expensive for you, I imagine.

07:35.416 --> 07:37.875
You aren't wearing any monocles at all.

07:37.958 --> 07:40.625
Now, I'm off to admire
the servant-thrashing quarters.

07:40.708 --> 07:43.666
Wait, your monocle hoarding intrigues me.

07:43.750 --> 07:46.041
I don't believe we've met, Mr…

07:46.125 --> 07:47.666
Please, call me Joffrey.

07:47.750 --> 07:50.041
Mister is the name of my uncle father.

07:52.708 --> 07:54.458
So, Dr. R, we took your advice,

07:54.541 --> 07:59.291
and we bought a boat to embark
on the first ever flat-Earth expedition.

07:59.375 --> 08:01.250
Do you have the coordinates
to the Earth's edge?

08:01.333 --> 08:04.291
Sure thing.
Latitude 5 degrees, 12 minutes,

08:04.375 --> 08:07.125
longitude 24 degrees, 46 minutes,

08:07.208 --> 08:08.416
and the Powerball is 12.

08:09.791 --> 08:11.833
Sandals? Who's going to Sandals?

08:11.916 --> 08:13.541
No one in this house likes fun.

08:14.125 --> 08:15.500
Flowers, cake,

08:15.583 --> 08:18.291
the smooth jazz grooves of Kenny G?

08:18.375 --> 08:20.916
-My wife is getting remarried!

08:21.000 --> 08:24.125
Hmm. Hey, Harold,
did you say you have a boat?

08:27.458 --> 08:29.916
I've forgotten my Dramamine.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.375
-I didn't.
-Oh!

08:32.250 --> 08:34.958
Bear-o, serve rappers first,
royalty second.

08:35.041 --> 08:36.416
Glenn, anything to report?

08:37.000 --> 08:39.416
-All quiet at the bar area.

08:39.500 --> 08:43.083
I've already lost my dignity.
This shrimp is all I have left.

08:43.166 --> 08:44.833
Suck my ass, Flipper!

08:47.333 --> 08:50.000
Okay, I survived being raised
by hardcore Christians.

08:50.083 --> 08:51.291
I can handle sobriety.

08:51.375 --> 08:54.166
Did I tell you guys
about my RPG tournament in high school?

08:54.250 --> 08:56.125
-It was--
-High-stakes Elder Scrolls.

08:56.208 --> 08:57.791
We know. You're the only person

08:57.875 --> 09:01.458
who tells the same bad story
over and over when they're not drunk.

09:01.541 --> 09:03.333
When I'm sober, my anxiety flares up.

09:03.416 --> 09:05.541
Shit! Piss! Boob! Gigi, you look stunning!

09:05.625 --> 09:06.458
The fuck?

09:06.541 --> 09:09.541
Sorry, so does my Tourette's.
But at least my OCD is under--

09:09.625 --> 09:12.041
One, two, three, four,
four, three, two, one.

09:12.125 --> 09:14.416
We need drugs, now.

09:24.291 --> 09:27.416
-Thank you, Mr., uh, G.

09:27.500 --> 09:31.250
-Everyone, the ceremony is about to begin.

09:33.375 --> 09:36.250
So hot. Looks like
the older version of my daughter.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.958
Please, please, be seated.

09:46.041 --> 09:48.958
Hello. Most of you
know me as Gwyneth Paltrow,

09:49.041 --> 09:54.166
but I'm also… "Tamiko's best friend."

09:54.250 --> 09:55.708
Mmm. Hugs.

09:55.791 --> 09:57.958
Today, we celebrate all the--

09:58.041 --> 09:59.250
-I object!

10:00.625 --> 10:03.541
Drop the rings
and keep your lips where I can see 'em.

10:03.625 --> 10:04.958
Oh God!

10:08.291 --> 10:09.208
Who the hell--

10:09.291 --> 10:11.708
Oh jeez, you brought the flat-earthers?

10:11.791 --> 10:14.375
Dr. Ridley,
why are we on a wedding cruise?

10:14.458 --> 10:17.125
Where's the groom?
I'm gonna kick his dick in the ass.

10:17.208 --> 10:19.333
Ha! There is no groom, Rand.

10:19.416 --> 10:22.958
I'm marrying myself
to make a statement about empowerment.

10:23.041 --> 10:25.791
What the… You just did this
to get my attention, didn't you?

10:25.875 --> 10:27.916
God, that's so stupid, it's sexy.

10:28.000 --> 10:29.125
You narcissist,

10:29.208 --> 10:32.083
trying to make my wedding
to myself about you.

10:32.166 --> 10:35.166
Wow, I'm starting to see
why you're so fucked-up, Reagan.

10:35.250 --> 10:36.541
There are layers.

10:36.625 --> 10:38.708
Dad, you have to leave.

10:38.791 --> 10:41.583
Does this mean that we're not going
to the edge of the Earth?

10:41.666 --> 10:42.625
Aw!

10:42.708 --> 10:44.916
But I wore my best fanny pack.

10:45.000 --> 10:46.875
Okay, sirs, my father tricked you.

10:46.958 --> 10:51.458
He does not think that the Earth is flat.
He was just using you to get to our boat.

10:51.541 --> 10:52.833
You lied to us?

10:52.916 --> 10:54.291
But we were so close,

10:54.375 --> 10:56.666
like the North Pole and the South Pole.

10:56.750 --> 10:57.958
Oh, come on.

10:58.041 --> 11:00.750
You don't actually think
the Earth is flat, right?

11:00.833 --> 11:02.333
Of course I do.

11:02.416 --> 11:03.875
Why would YouTube lie to me?

11:03.958 --> 11:05.666
"Because that's
how they get rich?"

11:05.750 --> 11:07.250
I find that hard to believe.

11:07.333 --> 11:10.416
Look, if you agree to go,
then I'll let you in on a secret.

11:10.500 --> 11:13.125
The Earth is not flat,
but it is hollow.

11:13.208 --> 11:16.041
We put this cap on it to keep krakens
from eating people's boats.

11:16.125 --> 11:17.458
Enough!

11:17.541 --> 11:20.541
You sphere mongers have been talking down

11:20.625 --> 11:22.833
to us flat-earthers for years.

11:22.916 --> 11:24.000
Yeah!

11:24.083 --> 11:25.833
-Well, no more.

11:27.083 --> 11:28.333
-Oh no!

11:30.291 --> 11:31.375
They got guns?

11:31.458 --> 11:33.875
They're adult men
who still use chat rooms.

11:33.958 --> 11:35.833
Of course they have guns.

11:35.916 --> 11:37.416
Don't worry, they're just bluff--

11:37.500 --> 11:39.875
-Oh my God, he just shot the bouncer!

11:45.333 --> 11:47.708
No more communication with the mainland.

11:48.708 --> 11:50.916
Look at me. Look at me.

11:51.000 --> 11:52.500
I'm the captain now.

11:55.875 --> 12:00.166
Hand over your wallets, cell phones,
and any spherical objects.

12:00.666 --> 12:03.583
Robots? Aliens? I knew it.

12:03.666 --> 12:06.708
It's the Deep State.
My theories are all correct.

12:06.791 --> 12:07.708
I'm not an alien.

12:07.791 --> 12:11.333
I'm a subterranean sentient mushroom
from a hive cluster--

12:11.416 --> 12:13.750
Okay, that's a lot to remember,
so you're an alien.

12:13.833 --> 12:16.708
Now which one of you Illuminatis

12:16.791 --> 12:20.291
is gonna tell me
where the edge of the Earth is?

12:20.375 --> 12:21.416
This is your fault.

12:21.500 --> 12:23.541
Everything you touch comes unglued.

12:23.625 --> 12:25.291
Our marriage, our child…

12:25.375 --> 12:27.250
Of course Reagan's screwed-up.

12:27.333 --> 12:29.500
She spent nine months inside of you.

12:29.583 --> 12:32.500
Fuck! Fuck! If I don't get
this situation under control,

12:32.583 --> 12:34.708
I'm gonna miss my flight to Bora-Bora.

12:34.791 --> 12:37.458
-What's going on?
-Glenn? Where are you?

12:37.541 --> 12:40.416
In a flesh prison
of my own making.

12:40.500 --> 12:42.625
We got boat-jacked by flat-Earth pirates.

12:42.708 --> 12:44.958
They're taking a stand about-- Against--

12:45.041 --> 12:47.500
Uh-- The purpose of the whole movement,
it's not really clear,

12:47.583 --> 12:49.583
but they are armed and uninformed!

12:49.666 --> 12:51.083
Uninvited guests?

12:51.166 --> 12:53.291
-Not on my watch.

12:55.875 --> 12:58.250
Okay, there's an air vent
above the ballroom.

12:58.333 --> 12:59.708
Make your way to it.

13:00.708 --> 13:03.041
I think we have a shot
if we take these guys by surprise.

13:03.125 --> 13:04.625
All right, Glenn,

13:04.708 --> 13:08.541
the best way to prove you're not fat
is to kill people.

13:08.625 --> 13:09.625
Let's do this.

13:13.500 --> 13:17.500
-Okay, Glenn, I'm ready.
-Copy. Flipper is in the net.

13:19.083 --> 13:21.458
I can't believe I've been taken hostage
on my own yacht.

13:21.541 --> 13:23.250
This is unconscionable.

13:23.333 --> 13:27.583
Holding all these people
in a hot, stuffy room for hours on end,

13:27.666 --> 13:31.000
making us pee in bottles
with no paid sick leave.

13:31.083 --> 13:33.625
This is in no way ironic to me.

13:33.708 --> 13:37.541
Well, I, for one,
want to buy your yacht even more

13:37.625 --> 13:40.625
now that it has the rich history
of a pirate takeover.

13:40.708 --> 13:41.916
What luxury.

13:42.000 --> 13:43.458
Here's your shit bucket.

13:44.458 --> 13:47.416
I'm having a panic attack.
I need to calm myself with calming noises.

13:47.500 --> 13:49.125
Scat, scat, scat! A-ooh, a-ooh!

13:49.208 --> 13:52.041
-Actually, uh, can you shoot me?
-Quiet!

13:52.125 --> 13:54.958
Someone tells me
how to get to the edge of the Earth,

13:55.041 --> 13:57.291
or a hostage dies every hour,

13:57.375 --> 14:01.583
starting with the richest man
in the world.

14:03.833 --> 14:05.500
Wh… what about Bezos?

14:05.583 --> 14:07.958
-He's the second-richest man.
-Second?

14:08.041 --> 14:09.875
Unless you've been lying.

14:11.291 --> 14:13.208
Even though we are both wealthy enough

14:13.291 --> 14:16.541
that the actual number
is abstract and meaningless,

14:16.625 --> 14:19.541
and anyone in their right mind
would just pay their taxes,

14:19.625 --> 14:22.875
I am, in fact, the richer man.

14:22.958 --> 14:24.791
I accept my fate.

14:25.958 --> 14:27.166
Brett, what are you doing?

14:27.250 --> 14:30.166
If they kill Bezos,
he won't be able to buy your boat.

14:30.750 --> 14:33.958
Damn it, you beautiful, brave, simple man.

14:37.750 --> 14:39.583
Glenn, it's now or never.

14:39.666 --> 14:43.208
Almost there.
Just a few more feet.

14:43.291 --> 14:45.291
-Glenn?
-Uh, we have a problem.

14:45.375 --> 14:47.583
-What?
-We're gonna need a bigger boat.

14:47.666 --> 14:49.250
Damn it, I can't do this alone.

14:49.333 --> 14:52.791
Darling, you had months
to find a plus-one.

14:52.875 --> 14:57.291
Mom, can you please stop telling me
how to live my… life?

14:59.708 --> 15:01.458
I need some kind of distraction

15:01.541 --> 15:03.791
so I can fix the ship's radio
and call for help.

15:03.875 --> 15:06.750
-Can you guys help me out here?
-Have you read The Secret?

15:06.833 --> 15:09.083
We could try manifesting
a little positivity.

15:09.166 --> 15:10.791
Manifest my ass!

15:10.875 --> 15:12.916
Will you two shut up?

15:13.000 --> 15:15.083
If I wanted to listen to parents arguing,

15:15.166 --> 15:17.583
I would've stayed
in me and my mom's bedroom.

15:17.666 --> 15:19.208
Actually, they won't shut up

15:19.291 --> 15:21.750
unless you let my mom finish her wedding

15:21.833 --> 15:23.833
and lock my dad in a room downstairs.

15:23.916 --> 15:25.125
Ah shit.

15:25.208 --> 15:27.458
Do that, and I will take you
to the Earth's edge.

15:27.541 --> 15:29.791
-Finally. All right, lock him up.

15:29.875 --> 15:31.958
Lock all our Deep State friends up.

15:32.041 --> 15:35.250
-Please be seated. We gather here again.

15:35.333 --> 15:36.333
You okay, Bezos?

15:36.416 --> 15:38.333
No! Thanks to Joffrey,

15:38.416 --> 15:41.541
everyone thinks
I'm the second-richest man in the world.

15:41.625 --> 15:43.916
I've never been more humiliated.

15:44.000 --> 15:45.625
Uh, he saved your life.

15:45.708 --> 15:47.875
Well, his kindness is his weakness.

15:47.958 --> 15:50.208
I'm buying your boat and renaming it

15:50.291 --> 15:53.750
the SS Alexa Blue Origin
Whole Foods Fresh.

15:53.833 --> 15:55.541
Who wants an Echo Dot?

15:56.541 --> 15:58.750
You did it. Attaboy, Joffrey.

15:58.833 --> 16:01.250
And now for the exchange of the ring.

16:01.333 --> 16:03.291
Oh no! I forgot the ring!

16:03.375 --> 16:04.375
I'll be right back.

16:04.458 --> 16:06.583
Harold, do me a favor
and read Corinthians.

16:06.666 --> 16:08.750
Um… Uh, oh.

16:08.833 --> 16:11.041
"Love is patient, love is kind."

16:11.625 --> 16:13.958
"It does not envy,
it does not boast,

16:14.041 --> 16:16.000
it is not proud. It does not dishonor…"

16:18.333 --> 16:22.500
Hello. What do people
think is round but is actually flat?

16:22.583 --> 16:23.625
Uh, the Earth.

16:23.708 --> 16:25.208
No, your balls.

16:28.333 --> 16:31.750
Okay, just patch this baby up,
and everything will be back under control.

16:31.833 --> 16:34.583
And then Tamiko says
I never listen to her

16:34.666 --> 16:38.041
because I'm only focused on negativity,
chaos, and revenge.

16:38.125 --> 16:39.833
Or something like that.
I wasn't listening.

16:39.916 --> 16:42.291
Let's fuck these pirates up.
Who's with me?

16:42.375 --> 16:44.333
What am I even doing with my life?

16:44.416 --> 16:47.041
I work in a basement
with a mushroom and a dolphin. What?

16:47.125 --> 16:49.083
Where's the kid that wrote slam poetry?

16:49.166 --> 16:52.333
I should've been a screenwriter.
It's not that hard!

16:52.416 --> 16:54.333
Eh, beats listening to this.

16:54.416 --> 16:56.416
-We're in.
-I am in as well.

17:00.083 --> 17:03.625
Let's give these assholes
a latitude adjustment.

17:03.708 --> 17:04.750
Whoa! Whoa!

17:05.250 --> 17:07.208
"…it is not easily angered--"

17:07.291 --> 17:08.833
Stop. I can't do this.

17:08.916 --> 17:10.833
The energy is all wrong.

17:13.083 --> 17:15.000
-See you 'round.

17:15.583 --> 17:18.250
Ha ha! Easy-peasy.

17:18.333 --> 17:20.208
-Flat's all, folks!

17:20.291 --> 17:21.583
Celebrate curves!

17:21.666 --> 17:24.041
-Jeff, this is all fixable.

17:24.125 --> 17:25.750
Screw that. Deal's off.

17:25.833 --> 17:29.208
If I wanted a sinking ship,
I'd buy another print newspaper.

17:33.666 --> 17:36.875
Yippee ki-yay,
mother-basement-dweller!

17:36.958 --> 17:38.958
Guys, I'm in the sunken place!

17:42.208 --> 17:45.375
There we go. Mayday, Mayday.
We've been hijacked by pirates.

17:45.458 --> 17:48.000
I've diffused the situation,
but we're gonna need backup.

17:48.083 --> 17:50.125
Roger that.
We have received your transmission.

17:50.208 --> 17:51.208
What are your coordinates?

17:51.291 --> 17:52.625
Motherfucker!

17:52.708 --> 17:54.958
Our coordinates are 40.3 north--

17:55.833 --> 17:56.916
What the fuck?

17:57.000 --> 17:58.583
I got ya, fucker!

17:59.708 --> 18:00.750
Mom! Dad!

18:00.833 --> 18:02.791
-Can't take your eyes off--
-Get off me!

18:02.875 --> 18:05.875
-Oh my God.
-Don't even look at me. You disgust me.

18:05.958 --> 18:10.458
Congratulations. It's total fucking chaos.
You know what, Mom?

18:10.541 --> 18:13.416
I am taking your advice,
and I am worrying about myself.

18:13.500 --> 18:15.583
Have fun solving your own problems.

18:18.625 --> 18:21.125
Time for my own me-rriage, dickwads.

18:21.208 --> 18:22.458
Oh no, you don't.

18:22.958 --> 18:23.833
Hold on--

18:23.916 --> 18:26.583
-My flagella!

18:27.375 --> 18:31.375
You're taking me to the edge of the Earth,
one way or another.

18:33.958 --> 18:36.125
-Look what you did.

18:36.208 --> 18:37.791
Mother's coming to save you.

18:37.875 --> 18:40.041
With what, veiled criticism?

18:40.791 --> 18:41.791
Are you serious?

18:42.375 --> 18:43.333
Are you serious?

18:43.416 --> 18:44.333
Are you serious?

18:44.875 --> 18:46.041
Are you serious?

18:46.125 --> 18:47.375
Are you serious?

18:47.458 --> 18:49.416
I'm serious. Drive.

18:49.500 --> 18:51.208
He's serious.

18:57.500 --> 19:00.833
I'm telling you, the Earth is not flat!
I made the whole thing up.

19:00.916 --> 19:03.791
You were gullible before.
Why can't you be gullible now?

19:03.875 --> 19:06.125
Brilliant, Rand.
Taunt the man with the gun.

19:06.208 --> 19:07.250
You got a better plan?

19:07.333 --> 19:09.416
I had a plan, but you guys ruined it,

19:09.500 --> 19:11.833
because all you ever do is hurt each other

19:11.916 --> 19:15.041
and create a big ol' shitstorm
that rains down on me.

19:16.458 --> 19:18.166
So when do we get to the edge?

19:18.250 --> 19:20.375
Soon. We just have to maintain our heading

19:20.458 --> 19:24.666
of 140 degrees at 25 knots,

19:24.750 --> 19:27.083
which are specific coordinates

19:27.166 --> 19:29.750
that we are going to, Glenn--
I mean, Harold.

19:31.000 --> 19:33.166
-We gotta help Reagan.

19:33.250 --> 19:36.291
The radio's busted, the engine controls
are shot. What can we do?

19:36.375 --> 19:39.125
There was something
I could have done, my duty.

19:39.208 --> 19:41.791
-I can still hear Reagan's voice now.

19:41.875 --> 19:44.208
Because she's talking
into your headset, Glenn.

19:44.291 --> 19:48.916
Again, our heading
is 140 degrees at 25 knots.

19:49.000 --> 19:51.583
Why is she going that way?
That just leads them out to the open sea.

19:51.666 --> 19:52.583
No, it doesn't.

19:52.666 --> 19:54.625
-Sober Andre?

19:54.708 --> 19:57.916
Guess again. I found a sweet teenth
of psilocybin, and it just kicked in.

19:58.000 --> 19:59.916
That was not yours to lick.

20:01.083 --> 20:02.333
With Reagan's trajectory,

20:02.416 --> 20:04.083
combined with a tailwind of…

20:04.166 --> 20:05.916
…seven and a half knots,

20:06.000 --> 20:09.666
she's taking them
to the portal to the Hollow Earth!

20:09.750 --> 20:12.291
Of course. She can't bring Harold
to the edge of the Earth,

20:12.375 --> 20:14.416
but she can make him think she is.

20:14.500 --> 20:16.916
Andre, this is your brain on drugs.

20:17.000 --> 20:18.083
Keep licking.

20:18.166 --> 20:19.833
-Oh!

20:21.333 --> 20:23.291
MI6. Got your Mayday.

20:23.375 --> 20:25.041
Can we be of assistance?

20:25.125 --> 20:27.291
Yes. I need a satellite phone, stat.

20:29.208 --> 20:32.875
Cognito HQ. Open the Hollow Earth portal.

20:32.958 --> 20:35.416
Wait! When the ocean water
drains into the portal,

20:35.500 --> 20:38.000
it'll create a whirlpool
that will suck Reagan's boat in!

20:38.083 --> 20:40.791
Swim to Reagan! Swim like the wind!

20:40.875 --> 20:42.458
Sir, yes, sir.

20:44.333 --> 20:47.208
Godspeed, you buoyant monstrosity.

21:08.333 --> 21:10.000
Bruce Almighty.

21:12.791 --> 21:15.000
Welcome to the edge of flat Earth.

21:15.083 --> 21:17.666
It's true! It's really true!

21:17.750 --> 21:20.666
-Take that, empirical evidence!
-Uh-oh.

21:20.750 --> 21:24.250
Uh, why are we drifting
towards that huge waterfall?

21:26.375 --> 21:27.666
Holy shit.

21:28.916 --> 21:32.958
So tired. Must use ocean powers.

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
Seal Team Six,
head southeast on the double!

21:39.083 --> 21:40.458
Yes, sir!

21:42.416 --> 21:43.416
Hang on!

21:44.791 --> 21:47.916
Uh, Reagan, honey,
time to go full throttle.

21:48.000 --> 21:51.708
-Yes! Yes! Keep going.

21:51.791 --> 21:56.750
I swear on my divorce lawyer's Maserati,
I will not die next to this asshole!

21:56.833 --> 21:59.291
Ah, you can make
an abyss feel claustrophobic.

21:59.375 --> 22:00.708
Will you shut up?

22:04.416 --> 22:05.541
Oh?

22:15.916 --> 22:19.541
You made it to the edge, Harold.
Yay! Let's go home.

22:19.625 --> 22:21.708
Home? No way. I wanna keep going.

22:21.791 --> 22:23.833
But you can't. It's the edge.

22:23.916 --> 22:25.375
Yeah, and when you go over it,

22:25.458 --> 22:28.583
it wraps around to the other side
of the Earth like in Pac-Man.

22:28.666 --> 22:30.791
Oh, I finally get to see Australia.

22:30.875 --> 22:32.125
Oh Jesus Christ.

22:32.208 --> 22:36.708
Harold, YouTube and Joe Rogan
are lying for your money and attention.

22:36.791 --> 22:38.791
Most conspiracies are just capitalism.

22:38.875 --> 22:41.750
Reagan, you fulfilled my life's dream.

22:41.833 --> 22:45.583
You don't have to come with me,
but I'm going to a land down under.

22:46.458 --> 22:48.625
Harold, wait.
Listen, this is not the Earth's edge.

22:48.708 --> 22:50.541
This is the portal to the Earth's core.

22:50.625 --> 22:52.750
Remember the sea monsters on old maps?

22:52.833 --> 22:53.791
They're down there!

22:53.875 --> 22:56.458
Pfft! Okay, what do I look like, an idiot?

22:56.541 --> 23:00.208
G'day, mate!

23:01.291 --> 23:05.041
Don't feel bad, darling.
He's in a better place now.

23:05.125 --> 23:06.916
Yeah, you'd-- Come on, totally.

23:07.000 --> 23:10.375
Mole people are like four feet tall.
They'll treat him like he's a king.

23:10.458 --> 23:11.375
Let's get out of here.

23:13.625 --> 23:16.541
Just try not to fight
on the ride back, okay?

23:16.625 --> 23:19.208
It's the least you can do
for making me miss my flight.

23:21.833 --> 23:22.958
I'm sorry, Reagan.

23:23.041 --> 23:26.333
Our uncoupling
has been anything but conscious.

23:26.416 --> 23:28.416
And I'm tired of being the bitter ex.

23:28.500 --> 23:31.583
-Maybe it's time to bury the hatchet.
-What do you mean?

23:31.666 --> 23:34.416
We got our bride. We got a witness.

23:34.500 --> 23:36.791
The sunset is perfect right now.

23:36.875 --> 23:39.333
Tamiko, will you remarry me?

23:39.416 --> 23:41.125
-No! No!

23:41.208 --> 23:43.166
-No! Glenn!

23:45.708 --> 23:46.583
Hey, wait--

23:48.708 --> 23:52.666
Now that we took care of that,
Mom, do you take you to be your bride,

23:52.750 --> 23:55.291
to have and to hold,
in sickness and in health

23:55.375 --> 23:59.000
for as long as you… both shall live?

23:59.791 --> 24:00.875
I do.

24:00.958 --> 24:03.291
By the power vested in me
by the Deep State,

24:03.375 --> 24:06.958
I now pronounce you spiritually renewed.

24:07.041 --> 24:09.125
You may kiss the you.

24:26.083 --> 24:29.166
I hear you handled yourself
quite famously with those pirates.

24:29.250 --> 24:32.041
Are you interested
in any other type of seaman?

24:32.125 --> 24:33.750
Normally, that'd be a "hell no,"

24:33.833 --> 24:39.000
but I have been inspired by my mom
to say yes to me, for once.

24:39.083 --> 24:40.375
And you have an accent.

24:44.041 --> 24:46.375
The Coast Guard said
they can tow your yacht in to shore.

24:46.458 --> 24:47.916
I got a better plan. Look.

24:48.000 --> 24:49.833
-Is that a kraken?

24:49.916 --> 24:50.916
Hell yes.

24:51.000 --> 24:53.750
I'm about to collect
on my yacht insurance policy.

24:53.833 --> 24:55.833
Hey, has anyone seen Jeff Bezos?

24:56.416 --> 24:58.958
Is the fight over? Guys?

25:01.083 --> 25:04.166
This is why I don't allow bathroom breaks!

25:09.750 --> 25:12.458
I can't believe Jeff Bezos is dead,

25:12.958 --> 25:15.625
and right in his prime.
