00:36.578 --> 00:39.331
"My Father's house has many rooms.

00:39.414 --> 00:41.083
If that were not so,

00:41.166 --> 00:45.170
would I have told you that I am
going there to prepare a place for you?

00:47.589 --> 00:50.425
And if I go and prepare a place for you,

00:50.509 --> 00:53.720
I will come back and take you
to be with me…

00:55.305 --> 00:59.017
so you also may be where I am."

01:03.564 --> 01:06.608
"Do not let your hearts be troubled."

01:06.692 --> 01:08.527
-No one came.
-No.

01:08.610 --> 01:11.989
I thought more people would come.

01:12.072 --> 01:13.407
People loved him, didn't they?

01:13.490 --> 01:16.869
Yeah. No, of course.
It's the flight and everything. Just--

01:16.952 --> 01:19.329
Got food for fucking hundred people.

01:20.455 --> 01:22.416
I'm sure
it'll all get eaten at some point.

01:22.499 --> 01:23.500
Yeah, thanks.

01:27.087 --> 01:31.258
I know that he's gone,
but it feels like he's here.

01:32.134 --> 01:34.386
Like, why wouldn't he be here right now?

01:35.721 --> 01:37.598
But no, I keep looking for him.

01:39.433 --> 01:40.976
That makes sense.

01:44.521 --> 01:49.484
Was his last night… happy?

01:51.570 --> 01:53.030
Sure.

01:57.868 --> 02:00.204
At the end of the night, after…

02:01.496 --> 02:04.041
-After the fight. That's what you mean?
-Right, the fight.

02:04.124 --> 02:07.794
But after that, we got some food,

02:07.878 --> 02:10.380
and he was making jokes, and he--

02:11.340 --> 02:12.925
He really did seem happy.

02:14.009 --> 02:17.930
But at the party, was he happy?
Was he enjoying his life?

02:19.848 --> 02:20.849
Yes.

02:26.897 --> 02:28.899
Who did he talk to at the party?

02:35.572 --> 02:38.659
-He landed some punches though?
-Yes, he did.

02:39.826 --> 02:42.579
-And he fell down and hit his head?
-Right.

02:42.663 --> 02:44.915
-How long was he on the ground?
-Honey.

02:44.998 --> 02:47.501
It wasn't that long. He got right back up.

02:47.584 --> 02:50.379
-And he didn't seem any different?
-No.

02:50.921 --> 02:52.714
Did his pupils look different?

02:53.715 --> 02:55.759
-I didn't notice.
-Stop.

02:55.843 --> 02:59.763
-I just wanna understand what happened.
-I don't think we can understand.

03:07.938 --> 03:11.608
And I don't know how much
longer he's gonna be alive.

03:12.276 --> 03:13.861
Maybe we should come over.

03:13.944 --> 03:15.529
Parents were there.

03:15.612 --> 03:18.699
He was sitting with them watching TV.

03:18.782 --> 03:21.910
He told me that he wanted to go
to a Tony Robbins seminar

03:21.994 --> 03:23.328
once he moved to California.

03:23.412 --> 03:24.413
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

03:24.496 --> 03:26.665
Wonder if he ever made it
to a Tony Robbins seminar.

03:26.748 --> 03:29.001
I don't know. He never mentioned it.

03:29.543 --> 03:31.962
Right. I guess he would have if he did.

03:32.045 --> 03:35.465
Yeah, I guess. Tony Robbins
people bring up Tony Robbins a lot.

03:37.092 --> 03:41.597
He always wanted to go to Tony Robbins,
and… now he never will.

03:42.848 --> 03:46.560
Tony Robbins is a very large man.

03:47.978 --> 03:48.979
I know.

03:53.358 --> 03:55.861
I can tell he was really lucky
to have you as a friend.

03:58.780 --> 04:04.161
-So, how long have you--
-I'm sorry. I just…

04:04.244 --> 04:05.662
Sure. Sure.

04:07.414 --> 04:08.582
So sorry.

04:10.542 --> 04:11.543
Sorry.

04:18.425 --> 04:19.676
Hey.

04:21.970 --> 04:22.971
Hey.

04:26.308 --> 04:27.392
This is weird.

04:28.519 --> 04:29.937
Yeah.

04:32.564 --> 04:34.525
I don't wanna go back in there.

04:34.608 --> 04:35.609
Me neither.

04:38.695 --> 04:40.239
I'm really gonna miss him.

04:40.864 --> 04:42.115
Yeah, me too.

04:45.035 --> 04:46.828
He was my only verified friend.

04:49.456 --> 04:51.291
Were you avoiding me in there?

04:53.126 --> 04:55.838
I just didn't know if you'd wanna talk.

04:55.921 --> 04:59.633
I think you didn't know if you wanted
to talk and you're putting that on me.

05:00.384 --> 05:01.593
Okay, sorry.

05:01.677 --> 05:06.515
It's fine. Actually, I'm sorry.
I don't need to be-- I--

05:06.598 --> 05:07.599
-God.
-It's okay.

05:07.683 --> 05:09.434
No. Today is a really fucked-up day.

05:09.518 --> 05:10.644
It is.

05:12.020 --> 05:14.898
-How did he really die?
-He hit his head.

05:14.982 --> 05:17.484
-You really think that's what happened?
-What do you mean?

05:17.568 --> 05:19.570
You don't think he killed himself?

05:22.030 --> 05:23.407
Why would you say that?

05:23.490 --> 05:27.369
I don't know. I'm sorry.
It's just so random.

05:27.452 --> 05:28.579
What are the odds?

05:28.662 --> 05:30.873
-No, that kind of head trauma, it happens.
-No.

05:30.956 --> 05:32.958
I'm talking about the whole thing.

05:33.041 --> 05:34.626
He and I weren't even friends
in high school,

05:34.710 --> 05:36.670
then we both happened
to move to LA at the same time.

05:36.753 --> 05:38.297
He happens to meet you out there.

05:38.380 --> 05:42.050
Then he introduces the two of us and
we become whatever it was that we were.

05:42.134 --> 05:44.845
And all because of what?
Him? Dax Peterson?

05:44.928 --> 05:46.096
From Algebra 2?

05:46.180 --> 05:47.848
And now, I'm at his funeral?

05:50.142 --> 05:51.602
What the fuck?

05:51.685 --> 05:54.313
That has gotta mean something.
That cannot just be random.

05:55.939 --> 05:56.982
No, I think it is.

06:00.277 --> 06:01.278
Right.

06:03.280 --> 06:05.657
-Sun came out.
-Thank God.

06:17.878 --> 06:19.463
-What are you looking at?
-Nothing.

06:20.172 --> 06:21.882
Yeah, what are you looking at?

06:21.965 --> 06:23.675
You don't usually wear your hair up.

06:24.676 --> 06:26.637
No. Was it a good thing?

06:27.554 --> 06:28.931
It's just an observation.

06:32.976 --> 06:33.977
How's teaching?

06:34.978 --> 06:35.979
It's good.

06:37.189 --> 06:39.149
-And?
-What?

06:39.233 --> 06:41.068
-I mean, I--
-Why do you ask?

06:42.194 --> 06:43.862
Because I'm asking. I'm interested.

06:47.407 --> 06:48.408
Okay.

06:48.492 --> 06:50.869
I mean, honestly, I love it.

06:50.953 --> 06:53.997
It's frustrating sometimes,
but I wake up every day,

06:54.081 --> 06:57.084
and I know what I'm doing
and why I'm doing it.

06:57.751 --> 06:59.294
It feels good.

06:59.378 --> 07:03.340
Wow, that's great.
I'm really happy to hear that.

07:03.423 --> 07:04.883
-You are?
-Yeah.

07:04.967 --> 07:07.761
-Why did you have to say that?
-What?

07:07.845 --> 07:09.471
That makes me sound
like a horrible person.

07:09.555 --> 07:11.348
-I didn't mean it--
-Josh,

07:12.099 --> 07:14.977
of course I'm happy for you.
I want you to be happy.

07:20.315 --> 07:21.358
Sorry.

07:23.485 --> 07:26.446
-Are you flying back tonight?
-Yeah, on the 10:00.

07:27.114 --> 07:30.117
-Fun, I know that flight.
-Yeah, how about you?

07:30.200 --> 07:31.493
No, tomorrow.

07:31.577 --> 07:34.705
I figured I'm here.
I should see my parents.

07:34.788 --> 07:36.498
Speaking of, I should go.

07:36.582 --> 07:39.042
I said I'd pick some stuff up for my mom.

07:39.126 --> 07:41.587
Okay. Say hi for me.

07:42.421 --> 07:43.755
If you're not busy, you could come.

07:43.839 --> 07:47.634
I think I should just go to the
airport. See if there's an earlier flight.

07:48.343 --> 07:49.386
There isn't.

07:52.639 --> 07:53.807
Yeah, I know.

07:56.018 --> 07:58.687
Honestly, this past year
has been really intense.

07:58.770 --> 08:01.064
Cosmo, like, almost died four times,

08:01.148 --> 08:03.275
and each time she makes him
get another surgery,

08:03.358 --> 08:04.443
and then he's alive again.

08:04.526 --> 08:06.820
-Isn't that kind of cruel?
-No, she needs him.

08:06.904 --> 08:09.364
Wouldn't it be nicer to the cat
if you just let him--

08:09.448 --> 08:13.535
I get it. But he is her whole world.

08:14.161 --> 08:15.704
He means everything to her.

08:15.787 --> 08:16.830
What about Frank?

08:20.083 --> 08:21.668
I feel bad for her.

08:22.586 --> 08:25.464
I mean, she is a sad, sad woman.
She really is.

08:26.298 --> 08:28.842
She loves that cat so much.

08:28.926 --> 08:32.596
Just the thought of her
waking up and Cosmo--

08:46.360 --> 08:48.570
-Oh, my God.
-It's okay.

08:51.490 --> 08:54.076
-Sorry.
-It's okay.

09:14.429 --> 09:16.390
Wow, that felt really good.

09:17.057 --> 09:18.684
You should do that. Have a cry.

09:18.767 --> 09:20.102
I'm good.

09:20.185 --> 09:21.854
Come on. It would be good for you.

09:21.937 --> 09:24.189
I don't think I could do that
if I wanted to.

09:24.273 --> 09:26.316
Excuse me. I just saw what happened.

09:26.400 --> 09:28.569
Are you okay? Is he bothering you at all?

09:31.154 --> 09:32.489
Yeah, he is.

09:33.031 --> 09:34.825
You need me to call someone?

09:35.409 --> 09:36.785
Maybe.

09:45.544 --> 09:47.004
That's not funny.

09:47.671 --> 09:50.841
Obviously it is. Come on.

10:05.772 --> 10:07.524
Your face.

10:13.947 --> 10:15.991
That's why I was always
dying to get out of here.

10:16.074 --> 10:17.826
No one has a sense of humor.

10:18.327 --> 10:21.580
I don't think that
would have landed any better in LA.

10:22.915 --> 10:25.334
Well, you liked it. So…

10:33.926 --> 10:36.678
-Are you dating anyone?
-I don't wanna talk about dating with you.

10:36.762 --> 10:38.263
Come on. We were both thinking about it.

10:38.347 --> 10:42.267
I'm happy to think about it
and not talk about it.

10:42.351 --> 10:43.519
Where are we going?

10:43.602 --> 10:46.438
It's the last stop. It's
my mom's special fruit place.

10:47.105 --> 10:50.192
I'm actually kinda hungry.
Should have eaten more before.

10:50.275 --> 10:52.653
There was food for a hundred people.

10:52.736 --> 10:53.737
I know. I heard.

10:54.321 --> 10:55.948
-You talked to his mom?
-Yeah.

10:56.031 --> 10:57.449
Sad.

11:00.118 --> 11:03.247
There's Ritz in the back.
'Cause Cheryl's gotta have her Ritz.

11:03.330 --> 11:04.748
-Can I have some?
-Yeah.

11:05.624 --> 11:08.418
There's a lot of sad moms today, huh?
What does that mean?

11:11.296 --> 11:12.464
Doesn't mean anything.

11:15.592 --> 11:16.593
How's Ruth?

11:16.677 --> 11:19.429
She's good. And…

11:20.973 --> 11:21.974
withheld.

11:23.058 --> 11:24.059
Withheld?

11:27.688 --> 11:29.147
Oh, shit.

11:29.857 --> 11:32.442
-Want one?
-Making a mess, huh?

11:32.526 --> 11:33.777
I'll pick those up.

11:38.949 --> 11:40.701
I'm not dating anyone.

11:42.911 --> 11:46.164
-You what?
-I'm not dating anyone.

11:47.291 --> 11:48.417
Okay.

11:49.334 --> 11:51.879
I mean, there's been
some almost dating people.

11:54.298 --> 11:55.424
Yeah.

11:57.676 --> 12:00.262
I've had that too.

12:00.345 --> 12:02.055
It's pathetic. No one likes me.

12:03.849 --> 12:06.476
I thought you'd be killing it on the apps.
You're so nonthreatening.

12:06.560 --> 12:07.936
-Thanks.
-You're welx.

12:08.020 --> 12:09.938
-I actually do get a lot of matches.
-See?

12:10.022 --> 12:12.733
Yeah, it's just, most people
I match with don't ever respond.

12:12.816 --> 12:14.193
What's wrong with that one?

12:14.276 --> 12:16.695
It's no good. What do you mean "people"?

12:16.778 --> 12:18.864
-The women.
-I was just checking.

12:18.947 --> 12:21.408
Yeah. I don't know if it helps
to have endless options.

12:21.491 --> 12:23.202
-What's wrong with that one?
-Which one?

12:23.285 --> 12:25.996
-The one you just had.
-Oh, no. No.

12:26.914 --> 12:28.665
Seriously? That's fucking exciting.

12:28.749 --> 12:31.585
Yeah. I'm super stoked.
I've had some really good feedback.

12:31.668 --> 12:34.171
Gonna take a few months off Covell
and go tour with it.

12:34.254 --> 12:36.215
-Wow!
-I bought a shitty van and everything.

12:36.840 --> 12:39.092
It has working windshield wipers.

12:40.052 --> 12:41.345
We could've used those.

12:41.428 --> 12:44.348
Oh, yeah. Then we wouldn't
have spent that weekend in Austin

12:44.431 --> 12:45.974
with Gabriel and Elena.

12:46.058 --> 12:48.560
-Gabriel and Elena.
-Yeah, those freaks.

12:50.062 --> 12:53.023
In hindsight, I don't think those two
even really liked our music.

12:53.106 --> 12:54.399
I think they did.

12:54.483 --> 12:56.443
They just also really liked our bodies.

12:57.027 --> 12:58.487
You still think we should've done that.

12:58.570 --> 13:00.364
-I do. Yes.
-I couldn't have.

13:00.447 --> 13:01.448
You're homophobic.

13:01.532 --> 13:04.952
It's not homophobic
to not wanna have sex with a guy.

13:05.035 --> 13:07.996
-You weren't gonna have sex with him.
-I think that's what he had in mind.

13:08.080 --> 13:10.374
-No, he wanted to watch.
-What, watch you and me?

13:10.457 --> 13:11.458
And her.

13:13.001 --> 13:14.002
Really?

13:14.086 --> 13:15.879
-Yeah, I thought so.
-Fuck.

13:17.047 --> 13:21.468
-That was not clear to me.
-Wow, you blew it, bro.

13:28.058 --> 13:30.561
But congrats on the album though.
It's great.

13:31.270 --> 13:32.479
Thank you.

13:32.563 --> 13:34.565
Yeah, it's taken me a minute, but I--

13:35.983 --> 13:41.864
I think I found a sound that
is just my own, you know?

13:43.615 --> 13:46.118
I'll have to come see you
when you play out in town.

13:47.119 --> 13:48.495
Definitely. Please.

13:50.539 --> 13:52.165
What about you? Are you playing?

13:54.918 --> 13:58.046
-We don't have to talk about it.
-No. It's fine. Yeah, I'm playing.

13:58.589 --> 14:02.301
-Yeah?
-You know I'll always play.

14:02.384 --> 14:03.385
Yeah, no. I know.

14:04.386 --> 14:06.889
Sorry, it's just you said
that you hadn't been playing.

14:06.972 --> 14:10.350
That was a long time ago.
That was, like, right after we broke up.

14:11.018 --> 14:12.019
Okay.

14:12.978 --> 14:14.563
Yeah, I've been…

14:16.648 --> 14:18.775
been making something.

14:20.652 --> 14:23.780
Yeah? What's it like?

14:27.367 --> 14:29.077
Hey. You okay?

14:30.245 --> 14:31.496
Yeah, sorry.

14:32.623 --> 14:35.042
-It's just a stressful few days.
-Yeah.

14:41.924 --> 14:44.927
Look, I'm sorry. I've been…

14:47.429 --> 14:49.014
having some anxiety.

14:49.097 --> 14:50.140
Hey, that's okay.

14:59.399 --> 15:02.027
Sorry. I'm just gonna-- I'm gonna…

15:02.861 --> 15:04.613
-go walk this off.
-Okay.

15:23.257 --> 15:25.384
We'll unload this stuff,
and I'll drive you to the airport.

15:25.467 --> 15:27.553
Oh, no. You don't have to do that.

15:27.636 --> 15:28.679
I want to.

15:30.639 --> 15:32.015
It's good to see you.

15:36.478 --> 15:39.231
Yeah. It's good to see you too.

15:39.314 --> 15:40.440
Josh?

15:41.108 --> 15:43.068
Oh, my God. Is that you?

15:43.151 --> 15:44.152
Hi, Cheryl.

15:44.653 --> 15:46.196
Get out of there and give me a hug!

15:46.280 --> 15:48.782
No. Mom,
we're just gonna unload this stuff

15:48.866 --> 15:51.451
-and I'm driving Josh to the airport.
-No.

15:51.535 --> 15:52.953
Frank! Josh is here!

15:53.537 --> 15:55.455
You guys, these apples are terrible.

15:55.539 --> 15:57.207
You gotta check 'em
before you put 'em in a bag.

15:57.291 --> 15:58.584
-Stop.
-Don't listen to her.

15:58.667 --> 16:00.252
-It's great to see you.
-Good to see you.

16:00.335 --> 16:02.671
-Look at you. You finally got old.
-Shut up.

16:02.754 --> 16:05.591
What? He knows what I mean.
You're not really old.

16:05.674 --> 16:07.718
You still got the rest of your life
ahead of you. Not like me.

16:07.801 --> 16:09.636
-Breaking news.
-Now what?

16:09.720 --> 16:11.513
See, that's what I'm talking about.

16:11.597 --> 16:14.433
The world's burning down and
we're all living our stupid lives.

16:14.516 --> 16:15.642
You hear what I put up with?

16:15.726 --> 16:18.061
Can you smell that? It's so bad.

16:18.145 --> 16:19.855
24-7, 365.

16:19.938 --> 16:20.939
How's Cosmo?

16:22.858 --> 16:26.445
He's not well. But he's hanging in there
'cause he's a trouper.

16:26.528 --> 16:28.488
And thank you for asking.

16:28.989 --> 16:30.073
God, I miss you.

16:30.866 --> 16:31.909
Mom.

16:31.992 --> 16:33.076
I miss you too, Cheryl.

16:33.660 --> 16:36.330
-Mom.
-No, I really do.

16:36.413 --> 16:39.249
I only wish it hadn't come to this
to see you again.

16:39.333 --> 16:41.585
God, so terrible.
I keep thinking about his mother.

16:41.668 --> 16:42.711
Yeah.

16:43.295 --> 16:45.172
-What can I fix you?
-No, we should go.

16:45.255 --> 16:48.383
Hey, Josh is not coming all this way
without me giving him something.

16:48.467 --> 16:49.801
Now, what do you want?

16:51.261 --> 16:52.804
-Got any fruit dip?
-Come on.

16:52.888 --> 16:54.181
You know me. Always.

16:54.264 --> 16:55.682
-You don't want fruit dip.
-I definitely do.

16:55.766 --> 16:57.434
Josh always loved my fruit dip.

17:06.944 --> 17:08.319
That is so good.

17:08.403 --> 17:09.988
Sometimes I just eat it with a spoon.

17:10.070 --> 17:12.199
-Don't I, Frank?
-She does.

17:12.281 --> 17:13.909
Remember when you learned the ingredients?

17:13.992 --> 17:15.410
Are we doing this again?

17:15.492 --> 17:17.162
Yeah, it's funny. What'd you say?

17:18.664 --> 17:21.375
Velveeta and Cool Whip.
How can two wrongs feel so right?

17:23.252 --> 17:24.545
I'm gonna need more wine.

17:25.337 --> 17:28.632
I don't miss working.
I just miss the community.

17:28.715 --> 17:32.094
It can get lonely.
And the news is just sad, sad, sad.

17:32.970 --> 17:36.598
You know, we gotta hold on to each other
'cause it's all we've got.

17:36.682 --> 17:38.433
If we let go, we're lost.

17:38.517 --> 17:40.769
It's like that song of yours.
It was so sweet.

17:40.853 --> 17:43.313
-What was that song, Meg? The one I liked.
-"The one" she liked.

17:43.397 --> 17:44.982
Why don't we listen to it?

17:45.065 --> 17:47.818
-No, we shouldn't listen to it.
-Yeah. Come on. It's great.

17:47.901 --> 17:49.236
It should've done more for you.

17:49.319 --> 17:50.320
Mom. No.

17:51.321 --> 17:53.031
-Here it is.
-Mom. Please.

17:53.115 --> 17:54.867
What number was it, Josh?

18:00.455 --> 18:02.416
It's track seven. But Megan's right.

18:02.499 --> 18:04.418
We really shouldn't listen.

18:14.011 --> 18:16.430
I just love this song.
It just sucks you right in.

18:19.558 --> 18:23.145
Another day slips away
And you're fading

18:23.770 --> 18:27.441
Your voice is so beautiful,
Meggie. Ever since you were little.

18:30.444 --> 18:35.657
They say love takes time
But why'd you waste mine, baby?

18:35.741 --> 18:37.534
Be honest now

18:37.618 --> 18:39.494
Why couldn't you two have figured it out?

18:39.578 --> 18:41.038
Mom, Jesus fucking Christ!

18:42.331 --> 18:45.042
I cannot believe
you're doing this right now.

18:46.627 --> 18:48.170
I don't understand her.

18:49.421 --> 18:51.507
Yeah, it's always hard to hear yourself.

18:52.049 --> 18:54.593
She always says that
I'm not supportive enough of her career,

18:54.676 --> 18:57.429
and then when I play her music,
she gets upset.

18:57.513 --> 18:58.805
That's her old music.

19:00.307 --> 19:01.767
Well, that's all she's got.

19:01.850 --> 19:03.143
I mean…

19:03.227 --> 19:05.229
She's always talking about this new album.

19:05.312 --> 19:08.273
Like, oh, she's working on it
and then, oh, it's finished.

19:08.357 --> 19:10.817
Then, oh, it's not really finished.
Oh, you can listen to it soon.

19:10.901 --> 19:13.320
But I never get to hear it.
And how long has it been?

19:13.403 --> 19:15.656
I don't even know.

19:18.116 --> 19:21.119
I mean, I worry about her.

19:21.203 --> 19:22.996
'Cause she's 31, and that's--

19:24.081 --> 19:25.624
For a woman…

19:26.583 --> 19:28.919
You can't bartend forever, right?

19:29.002 --> 19:30.712
Now, you were reasonable.

19:30.796 --> 19:33.465
And I told her she should just
marry you already.

19:34.049 --> 19:35.467
You can't stay engaged forever.

19:35.551 --> 19:38.303
And you guys were just so good together.

19:40.055 --> 19:41.473
Shit. Cheryl, are you okay?

19:44.601 --> 19:46.103
I'm gonna get something to clean that.

19:46.186 --> 19:47.813
Jesus Christ. What is wrong with you?

19:47.896 --> 19:49.898
-It's not my fault.
-Whose fucking fault is it?

19:49.982 --> 19:51.859
-Here we go.
-You don't need to do this.

19:51.942 --> 19:53.193
Frank and I will do this.

19:53.277 --> 19:55.153
What the hell did you have for lunch?

19:55.237 --> 19:56.238
Just help me!

19:56.321 --> 19:57.698
-Josh, stop.
-I don't mind.

19:57.781 --> 19:59.366
I don't want you to. It's disgusting.

19:59.449 --> 20:01.076
Fucking right. Makes me wanna puke too.

20:01.159 --> 20:02.578
Shut up!

20:09.835 --> 20:11.128
Yeah?

20:13.005 --> 20:14.047
Hey.

20:15.257 --> 20:16.258
Hey.

20:23.473 --> 20:30.022
So, your mom just vomited fruit dip.

20:31.398 --> 20:34.443
-What?
-Sorry. It's not funny.

20:35.569 --> 20:36.570
Yeah.

20:37.863 --> 20:40.699
Not in the toilet.
She vomited all over herself

20:40.782 --> 20:42.993
and the table and the floor
and everything.

20:43.076 --> 20:44.995
-Oh, my God.
-Yeah.

20:45.078 --> 20:47.247
-Oh, my God.
-Good news is your dad's awake now.

20:51.752 --> 20:53.086
Yeah, that's good.

21:08.101 --> 21:09.102
No.

21:11.813 --> 21:13.524
Dax died.

21:14.107 --> 21:16.276
I just don't think we should get confused.

21:16.360 --> 21:17.611
What if we're not?

21:19.238 --> 21:20.864
I can't go back.

21:24.076 --> 21:25.118
Okay.

21:37.840 --> 21:38.966
Why'd you leave?

21:39.716 --> 21:41.051
Let's not do this right now.

21:41.134 --> 21:42.845
No, you should have to say it to my face.

21:42.928 --> 21:46.265
I have said it to your face.
Many times, Josh.

21:47.057 --> 21:49.560
You left me way before I left you.

21:49.643 --> 21:52.396
You did. You were the one that decided
to just give up

21:52.479 --> 21:55.440
on everything that we had been
building together for six years.

21:55.524 --> 21:57.901
-You didn't talk to me about it.
-What are you saying?

21:57.985 --> 22:01.029
All we ever did was
talk about what we're building together.

22:01.113 --> 22:02.990
Yeah, and then you stopped.

22:03.073 --> 22:05.284
I was just told that's it.
We don't have a band anymore.

22:05.367 --> 22:06.869
-That's over.
-It was over.

22:06.952 --> 22:09.872
If you think that that band was
going anywhere or something,

22:09.955 --> 22:11.039
that's delusional.

22:11.957 --> 22:13.000
Right.

22:13.083 --> 22:15.127
I'm sorry. Trust me.
I didn't want that either.

22:15.210 --> 22:17.004
But at a certain point, you know--

22:17.087 --> 22:19.798
I mean, we said it was time
to be grown-ups.

22:20.632 --> 22:22.467
We said we wanted a family.

22:24.178 --> 22:27.598
I was just doing what I thought
I had to do to make that happen.

22:27.681 --> 22:29.057
And then when I did…

22:32.644 --> 22:34.229
you didn't want me anymore.

22:35.230 --> 22:38.400
You didn't wanna be with some
normal guy with a job.

22:39.776 --> 22:42.487
Don't do that.

22:42.571 --> 22:46.867
Don't make me out to be
some superficial asshole.

22:46.950 --> 22:49.244
I didn't leave you
because you became a teacher.

22:50.579 --> 22:54.291
I left because I thought I was doing
what I love with the man I love.

22:55.209 --> 22:56.877
Loved.

22:58.212 --> 23:00.255
But yeah, evidently,
I was having fucking delusions.

23:00.339 --> 23:01.840
That's not what I meant.

23:01.924 --> 23:04.051
I was trying to do what was best for us.

23:04.134 --> 23:06.637
No, you weren't.
You were doing what was best for you.

23:06.720 --> 23:10.057
And then when I kept going
and I tried to do it alone,

23:10.140 --> 23:13.894
by myself, you made me feel so small.

23:14.394 --> 23:18.774
Like I was this idiotic little girl that

23:19.733 --> 23:21.735
couldn't see the writing
on the wall like the man could.

23:21.818 --> 23:23.654
I didn't say that.
I never said you were idiotic.

23:23.737 --> 23:25.239
-No. I know.
-I never said that.

23:25.322 --> 23:27.824
You were so sure that you were right.

23:29.326 --> 23:30.869
God, the way you see the world, Josh,

23:30.953 --> 23:33.205
is the only way
it could possibly ever exist.

23:35.165 --> 23:37.543
You still think you're right. Look at you.

23:38.210 --> 23:39.795
You're thinking it right now.

23:46.009 --> 23:48.095
Do you know how much that hurts?

23:51.473 --> 23:55.143
The person that you love
is supposed to believe in you.

23:57.020 --> 24:00.315
And you never believed in me.
You never thought I could do it.

24:05.821 --> 24:07.698
I don't think anyone can do it.
