WEBVTT

00:05.505 --> 00:07.083
That's our programme.

00:07.257 --> 00:09.214
Thanks for tuning into Jazz
on Starry Night.

00:11.094 --> 00:13.133
Sigalert from earlier this evening...

00:32.741 --> 00:34.199
Rafael!

01:17.994 --> 01:20.781
- You can't sing both parts of a duet.
- Says who?

01:20.955 --> 01:22.070
Not in a competition.

01:22.248 --> 01:24.241
That sounds
like second place talking.

01:24.417 --> 01:26.457
I was clearly the better performer
last night.

01:26.628 --> 01:29.249
You can ask Kensi, Hetty,
Nate, Eric.

01:29.422 --> 01:31.331
Come on, man.
They saw it with their own ears.

01:31.508 --> 01:34.081
Well, a table of impartial observers
would beg to differ.

01:34.260 --> 01:36.170
Those women
were seriously hammered.

01:36.346 --> 01:38.671
And you let them vote.

01:39.140 --> 01:42.260
"To All the Girls I've Loved Before"
is a karaoke classic.

01:42.435 --> 01:44.143
I just made it my own.

01:44.312 --> 01:46.554
And my fans clearly appreciated
the effort.

01:46.731 --> 01:49.400
You held your nose
during Willie Nelson's parts.

01:49.567 --> 01:51.726
That was very original.

01:51.903 --> 01:54.441
"My Funny Valentine?"
What, are you kidding me?

01:54.614 --> 01:57.401
No. I hear that's in heavy rotation
at the senior's centre.

01:58.201 --> 02:00.774
It's a jazz standard.

02:00.954 --> 02:03.575
Huh. Just be glad you're not Nate.

02:03.915 --> 02:05.457
Julio, Willie.

02:06.835 --> 02:08.578
Valentine.

02:09.378 --> 02:10.577
- Hetty here yet?
- No.

02:10.755 --> 02:12.499
But Backstreet's back. Ha!

02:14.968 --> 02:17.126
- Is there any coffee?
- Yeah.

02:17.303 --> 02:21.550
Nate, friends do not let friends
sing boy bands.

02:21.724 --> 02:24.678
Mm. Who has an extra pencil?

02:29.899 --> 02:31.393
Are you sure you're not still drunk?

02:31.776 --> 02:32.807
Maybe.

02:33.695 --> 02:36.364
Anyone know how long this,
uh, seminar thing is supposed to go?

02:36.531 --> 02:39.401
Last year was six and a half hours
before the first bathroom break.

02:39.576 --> 02:41.118
Oh, my God.

02:41.661 --> 02:43.452
Has anyone seen Dom?

02:43.621 --> 02:45.744
No, but that's one way to avoid
a hangover.

02:45.915 --> 02:48.537
- Don't show up for karaoke.
- Yeah. Don't show up for work.

02:48.710 --> 02:50.453
Thirty seconds,
he's gonna be rookie meat.

02:50.628 --> 02:53.036
Your watch is slow, Mr. Callen.

02:53.214 --> 02:56.049
- Bravo.
- Hetty, all right.

02:56.217 --> 02:58.459
- Wow. The crowd goes wild.
- Oh.

02:58.636 --> 03:00.795
"Wanted Dead or Alive."

03:00.972 --> 03:02.347
An inspired choice, Hetty.

03:02.515 --> 03:07.473
Well, there's no magic
quite like the quixotic combination

03:07.645 --> 03:11.939
of the Messrs.,
cognac and Bon Jovi.

03:13.902 --> 03:17.436
But given our various states
of post inebriation,

03:18.156 --> 03:22.818
I will waste no time in welcoming each
and almost every one of you

03:22.994 --> 03:27.952
to our mandated annual
workplace safety evaluation.

03:29.500 --> 03:31.078
Where is Mr. Vail?

03:31.252 --> 03:33.957
I just called him
and it went straight to voicemail.

03:34.130 --> 03:35.375
Huh. He didn't get the memo?

03:35.548 --> 03:38.917
Maybe we should postpone this
until we're all here.

03:39.093 --> 03:43.720
Oh, no. I'll prepare a make-up session
especially for Dom.

03:43.890 --> 03:47.970
Have no fear.
It will consume his entire weekend.

03:48.144 --> 03:49.935
Number two pencils.

03:50.438 --> 03:51.980
The tools of ignorance.

03:52.148 --> 03:54.900
Let's open our books to page one.

03:55.068 --> 03:56.099
And begin.

03:58.196 --> 04:01.150
- Sorry. Off.
- Mm-hm.

04:01.783 --> 04:05.199
"A safe work environment
is not just a goal..."

04:06.746 --> 04:08.371
That's me. Sorry.

04:08.915 --> 04:10.077
Phaser's on stun.

04:10.250 --> 04:13.204
Does the word "vibrate" mean anything
to you people?

04:16.422 --> 04:18.332
If you're behind this, Mr. Beale...

04:18.507 --> 04:21.509
What? Ugh. It wasn't me.
Pinky promise.

04:22.887 --> 04:24.216
Oh, lord.

04:24.389 --> 04:28.338
It's an Agent Needs Assistance alert.
It's coming from Dom's phone.

04:28.518 --> 04:30.012
Let's find him.

04:33.940 --> 04:36.347
Broadcast for 15 seconds
and then it stopped.

04:36.526 --> 04:38.981
- Maybe he pocket-dialled it?
- There's almost no chance

04:39.153 --> 04:42.487
that Dom's specific four-digit sequence
got entered accidentally.

04:42.657 --> 04:46.073
Had to happen twice. Sender has
to enter the same code to turn it off.

04:46.244 --> 04:47.952
Straight to voicemail first ring.

04:48.538 --> 04:50.827
So the alert got turned off
and so did his phone.

04:50.999 --> 04:52.576
Turn it back on.

04:53.543 --> 04:56.460
Mm-mm, it's not responding.
Battery is either dead or taken out.

04:56.629 --> 04:57.910
What about a GPS log?

04:58.089 --> 05:00.247
Wasn't broadcast long enough.
I can't get a position.

05:00.425 --> 05:02.797
Dom's home phone
is not answering either.

05:02.969 --> 05:04.760
What about the GPS in his car?

05:06.806 --> 05:08.882
All right, I got it.
Just south of downtown.

05:09.058 --> 05:10.434
An alley off 18th and Santa Fe.

05:21.738 --> 05:24.311
No, it's their jurisdiction, okay?

05:25.616 --> 05:27.775
What the heck was Dom
doing down here?

05:27.952 --> 05:28.983
It's his usual shortcut.

05:29.162 --> 05:31.569
He takes the alley
to avoid the long light at Santa Fe.

05:45.136 --> 05:46.416
Oh, my God.

06:08.001 --> 06:10.124
Hang on a second, I'll be right there.

06:10.295 --> 06:11.919
- Hit me up, G.
- Eric,

06:12.088 --> 06:14.413
check for traffic cameras in the alley,
this parking lot,

06:14.591 --> 06:15.753
anywhere nearby, okay?

06:15.925 --> 06:17.550
See if there was anyone tailing Dom.

06:18.011 --> 06:19.173
Looking now.

06:20.096 --> 06:22.634
This is just how we found it
about 45 minutes ago.

06:22.807 --> 06:24.266
No body.

06:25.727 --> 06:28.348
IPod, cash, house keys,
laptop still here.

06:28.521 --> 06:29.766
This wasn't a robbery.

06:30.148 --> 06:31.642
Did anybody see anything?

06:31.816 --> 06:34.272
No witnesses at all.
That's not surprising, though.

06:34.444 --> 06:37.979
This part of town's no man's land
till rush hour kicks in around 7.

06:38.156 --> 06:40.528
A guy stopped at a light on 18th,
called it in.

06:40.700 --> 06:42.906
Bullet holes have a raised edge
from the outside.

06:43.077 --> 06:44.737
Shots came from inside the car.

06:44.913 --> 06:47.748
There's a lot of blood
and a lot of glass.

06:47.916 --> 06:49.873
Okay. So Dom comes through here,

06:50.043 --> 06:51.323
he stops for some reason.

06:51.503 --> 06:53.661
Somebody sneaks up,
smashes the driver's window.

06:53.838 --> 06:56.543
Second assailant smashes
the passenger-side window,

06:56.716 --> 07:00.334
forces his way in,
throws it in park, they struggle.

07:00.512 --> 07:02.172
Bang, bang, bang.

07:02.347 --> 07:03.675
He's been here a few months?

07:05.058 --> 07:06.386
What does he know
about shortcuts?

07:06.559 --> 07:08.552
- Yeah?
- There are traffic cams

07:08.728 --> 07:10.187
at every intersection downtown.

07:10.355 --> 07:13.272
Near your alley and in the parking lot,
no video at all.

07:13.983 --> 07:16.272
Cameras everywhere on Dom's route,
but this spot.

07:16.444 --> 07:18.318
Is he taking the short cut
to and from work?

07:18.488 --> 07:20.979
- The car is pointed east.
- That means he was headed home.

07:21.157 --> 07:23.197
Well, in that case,
this happened last night.

07:23.368 --> 07:25.656
Then why did we get
an assistance call this morning?

07:25.828 --> 07:28.320
Dom must've gotten his phone
this morning, even for a second.

07:29.123 --> 07:30.783
Something went wrong
when they took him...

07:30.959 --> 07:33.532
Bad guys got sidetracked somehow.

07:35.588 --> 07:39.171
Guys, onboard camera
was activated.

07:39.342 --> 07:41.085
Hard drive has a bullet hole
in it, though.

07:41.261 --> 07:43.502
Techs might still be able to pull
some footage off it.

07:44.222 --> 07:46.049
You know what?

07:46.599 --> 07:48.508
No one bleeds this much
and survives.

07:53.731 --> 07:55.973
Ty, could you look at this?

07:56.985 --> 07:59.392
Oh. Poor little fella.

07:59.904 --> 08:02.193
Who'd wanna shoot you?

08:02.490 --> 08:04.281
You talk to your computer parts?

08:04.659 --> 08:07.067
Do you talk to your plants
when you water them?

08:07.245 --> 08:09.570
Just my orchids,
but they can be tricky.

08:09.747 --> 08:12.203
Look, hard drives
are like people, okay?

08:12.375 --> 08:15.329
Take one to the casing
and it's like getting shot in the butt.

08:15.503 --> 08:17.247
Hurts, but probably
not gonna kill you.

08:17.422 --> 08:21.633
But take one to the platter, like...
It's like getting shot through the heart.

08:23.428 --> 08:24.708
Wait.

08:24.887 --> 08:26.547
Is this from Dom's car?

08:27.515 --> 08:29.093
Yeah.

08:30.393 --> 08:34.342
He's supposed to bring in a cooling fan
from an old G4 tower today.

08:35.481 --> 08:39.063
We're building a PC together.
Rule is spare parts only.

08:39.611 --> 08:44.687
He's a pretty good geek, you know,
for an agent.

08:47.619 --> 08:49.777
Just see what you can get off it.

08:53.625 --> 08:55.451
As far as Dom's demeanour
is concerned,

08:55.627 --> 08:57.785
I noticed nothing unusual
in the past few days.

08:57.962 --> 08:59.587
And what about his laptop?

08:59.756 --> 09:01.380
From what we can tell, untouched.

09:01.549 --> 09:05.381
That's not surprising.
Dom's a stickler for security.

09:06.721 --> 09:09.129
- What about witnesses?
- There's no witnesses, Hetty.

09:11.225 --> 09:12.885
Why did this happen?

09:13.061 --> 09:14.685
I mean, why Dom?

09:15.146 --> 09:16.724
Right now, we have no idea.

09:18.066 --> 09:22.395
Okay, FBI, DEA and ICE
they've all called to offer their help.

09:22.737 --> 09:23.900
Work them.

09:24.072 --> 09:27.238
Cross-reference threats
to their agents.

09:27.408 --> 09:30.824
See if there have been
any similar abductions.

09:30.995 --> 09:34.744
Do whatever you have to do
to find him.

09:34.916 --> 09:37.751
By whatever means necessary.

09:46.344 --> 09:49.547
- You ever been here before?
- No.

09:50.098 --> 09:51.806
Me neither.

09:53.101 --> 09:56.434
Hey, it's not unusual to wait
a considerable period of time

09:56.604 --> 09:59.439
before visiting the residence
of a colleague, okay?

10:07.699 --> 10:08.861
Okay.

10:09.033 --> 10:13.991
Dom went straight from college
at MIT to training at FLETC to us.

10:14.163 --> 10:16.037
A guy in a hurry
to get his life started.

10:22.630 --> 10:24.789
You know, he told me
he was so excited to come to L.A.

10:24.966 --> 10:28.002
That he didn't even stop
at his folk's place to pick up his stuff.

10:30.805 --> 10:33.261
We really never got to know him.

10:34.308 --> 10:35.471
Nate.

10:36.185 --> 10:37.514
Don't go there.

10:38.438 --> 10:40.845
Sorry. I didn't mean it like that.

10:43.484 --> 10:45.810
So who calls to tell them
that he's missing?

10:46.320 --> 10:48.562
Maybe the director. Maybe Hetty.

10:50.032 --> 10:52.155
I've never had to make
one of those calls before.

10:59.041 --> 11:01.034
He didn't come home last night.

11:04.338 --> 11:05.881
Why two monitors?

11:07.425 --> 11:09.168
Internet? Game console.

11:11.929 --> 11:14.717
Dom tapped into
the parking garage security system.

11:17.560 --> 11:19.718
Building's got cameras.

11:22.273 --> 11:26.318
All his e-mails ran through
the secure server at NCIS.

11:26.486 --> 11:27.517
Nothing suspicious here.

11:27.695 --> 11:30.233
No indication that he thought
anyone was targeting him.

11:30.406 --> 11:33.656
What about his personal stuff?
His browser. Go through his history.

11:34.035 --> 11:35.197
You wanna do this?

11:38.873 --> 11:43.416
No. It's gadget blogs, news sites,
tech reviews and...

11:43.586 --> 11:44.961
Doesn't even clear his cache.

11:45.129 --> 11:47.454
We don't all need private browsing.

11:49.008 --> 11:52.092
He hasn't been around long enough
to make enemies, Sam.

11:52.261 --> 11:53.921
So, what are you saying?

11:54.097 --> 11:55.555
- It was random?
- Maybe.

11:56.307 --> 11:58.015
I mean, bad things happen
in this town.

11:58.184 --> 12:00.011
Wrong place? Wrong time?
Come on, G.

12:00.186 --> 12:02.807
Well, he's a kid. Driving down an alley
in a bad part of town.

12:02.980 --> 12:05.685
- It's as good as anything we've got.
- Which is a lot of nothing.

12:05.858 --> 12:09.690
You know as well as I do
no one gets snatched up for nothing.

12:11.989 --> 12:13.448
We got something.

12:16.369 --> 12:19.904
So we've got three cameras in the
parking garage, all Internet enabled.

12:20.081 --> 12:22.536
Four-digit password,
eminently hackable.

12:22.708 --> 12:24.251
Well, how far can you go back?

12:24.418 --> 12:27.040
Uh, well, the DVR they're connected to
records continuously

12:27.213 --> 12:29.004
for five days and then resets.

12:29.173 --> 12:32.625
So we've got one, two, three angles.
And here's Dom's car.

12:32.802 --> 12:35.091
Coming and going lots of times.

12:35.471 --> 12:38.342
- When's this from?
- Um, last week.

12:38.683 --> 12:40.343
And that one?

12:40.518 --> 12:42.261
Yesterday. Why?

12:42.687 --> 12:44.975
Put them both on the screen for me,
side by side.

12:52.780 --> 12:54.488
New camera.

12:55.283 --> 12:57.571
And it's mounted
right above Dom's parking spot.

12:57.743 --> 12:59.238
Where's the footage
from that camera?

13:01.330 --> 13:03.868
There isn't any. It's not connected
to the building's system.

13:04.041 --> 13:06.829
But if that is new, the other
should have footage of who put it up.

13:13.050 --> 13:15.624
- That's not Dom.
- It's from two days ago.

13:16.637 --> 13:18.429
Shoulders are hunched, tense.

13:18.598 --> 13:21.801
His body language definitely suggests
he's conscious of being watched.

13:21.976 --> 13:24.218
The installer knew
other cameras were there.

13:24.395 --> 13:26.020
His face is hidden intentionally.

13:26.189 --> 13:28.893
Why not disable other cameras
if you're worried about being seen?

13:29.066 --> 13:32.270
Shut down three video feeds, someone
from the office is gonna check.

13:32.862 --> 13:35.946
Okay, see that antenna?
The new camera's wireless.

13:36.115 --> 13:38.784
It's designed to be monitored
from a laptop nearby.

13:38.951 --> 13:40.149
The image isn't clear.

13:40.328 --> 13:42.700
Is this good enough
to run through facial recognition?

13:43.247 --> 13:45.821
- Doubt it.
- Do it anyway.

13:49.545 --> 13:52.463
You and me set up on a target
to run surveillance. How long?

13:53.049 --> 13:56.418
Two to three weeks
to chart a guy's habits, patterns.

13:56.594 --> 13:57.625
Minimum.

13:57.803 --> 14:01.504
Dom gets snatched up two days
after that camera gets installed?

14:17.949 --> 14:20.522
All right. It all came together quickly.
What is your point?

14:20.868 --> 14:22.327
Pros are deliberate.

14:22.495 --> 14:24.784
Whoever did this
was obviously professional.

14:24.956 --> 14:27.079
Why would they break
operational security?

14:27.250 --> 14:30.334
Well, maybe they paid a premium
to get this done quickly.

14:30.962 --> 14:32.420
Why Dom?

14:32.755 --> 14:34.415
He's a rookie.

14:34.590 --> 14:37.544
He's never been with any agency
other than NCIS.

14:37.718 --> 14:41.716
You said it. He wasn't on the job
long enough to make any enemies.

14:43.057 --> 14:45.263
Maybe it's not about Dom.

14:46.602 --> 14:47.978
Maybe it's about us.

14:48.145 --> 14:51.312
Huh. We've got enemies.

14:52.608 --> 14:53.723
Lots of them.

14:53.901 --> 14:57.235
So maybe somebody wants to send us
a message.

14:57.405 --> 14:59.196
Dom's the easiest one to grab.

15:00.199 --> 15:01.943
I told him. "Change your routes.

15:02.118 --> 15:04.241
Vary your time table.
Stay alert for tails."

15:04.912 --> 15:07.581
Sam, what were you gonna do?

15:07.748 --> 15:11.117
You gonna pick him up in the morning?
Drop him off at the end of the night?

15:11.294 --> 15:13.666
He was new. We were supposed
to watch out for him, G.

15:14.797 --> 15:16.790
Dom's phone just came back on.

15:19.260 --> 15:22.344
Audio and video from Dom's phone,
waiting on the GPS lock.

15:31.439 --> 15:32.470
What is that?

15:32.898 --> 15:34.309
Looks like a hand.

15:34.483 --> 15:35.978
Come on, Eric. Where is he?

15:36.152 --> 15:37.183
Triangulating.

15:37.361 --> 15:39.935
It's north. Maybe in the valley.

15:42.616 --> 15:43.945
No. Still north.

15:44.910 --> 15:46.286
Santa Clarita?

15:48.622 --> 15:51.908
- Private residence. Valencia.
- Tell Kensi to meet us in the car.

16:23.574 --> 16:25.863
- Clear.
- Clear.

16:26.035 --> 16:27.494
Clear.

16:45.971 --> 16:47.514
Clear.

16:47.681 --> 16:48.880
Clear.

17:05.616 --> 17:07.194
Clear.

17:07.867 --> 17:08.900
No Dom.

17:18.378 --> 17:19.458
We're too late.

17:38.891 --> 17:40.718
Like a makeshift hospital in here.

17:40.893 --> 17:42.636
I hate hospitals.

17:42.811 --> 17:45.433
- No ID.
- Huh. Shocking.

17:47.650 --> 17:50.057
Whoever put this in
hit the vein on the first try.

17:50.235 --> 17:52.691
He's a pro. A doctor? A nurse?

17:52.863 --> 17:55.650
Yeah. Whoever it was, they tried
pretty damn hard to save him.

17:55.824 --> 17:57.449
Not hard enough.

17:57.618 --> 17:58.649
This is Dom's phone.

17:59.370 --> 18:01.078
Why leave the phone behind?

18:01.246 --> 18:04.947
Why not? Took the battery out
so we couldn't track it.

18:05.125 --> 18:08.494
Okay. So this guy comes to,

18:09.213 --> 18:12.000
sees the phone,
drags himself across the carpet.

18:12.174 --> 18:14.214
Make one last call.

18:18.389 --> 18:19.420
Incomplete.

18:21.266 --> 18:22.298
Yeah.

18:22.977 --> 18:25.099
But he activated the GPS for us.

18:25.562 --> 18:27.354
This IV's got a serial number
on it.

18:27.523 --> 18:28.898
Here.

18:36.699 --> 18:40.281
Eric, it's coming to you.
Run it through facial recognition.

18:42.121 --> 18:43.615
Every available database.

18:48.502 --> 18:50.625
These guys try to take Dom,
he fights back,

18:50.796 --> 18:52.207
one of them gets shot.

18:52.381 --> 18:55.465
Buddies brought him out here
to fix him up, but lost too much blood.

18:55.634 --> 18:59.928
IV, bandages, morphine.
Leaving a phone behind.

19:00.097 --> 19:02.469
They didn't leave him here to die.

19:03.559 --> 19:05.053
Wait.

19:05.769 --> 19:08.058
If Dom wounded him
before being abducted,

19:08.230 --> 19:11.065
it could mean that the blood we found
in the car wasn't Dom's.

19:12.067 --> 19:14.902
I like the sound of that.
Let's get it tested.

19:15.070 --> 19:16.944
Keep hope alive.

19:17.698 --> 19:18.943
Yeah.

19:20.451 --> 19:21.909
Yeah.

19:28.250 --> 19:30.124
- News, Eric?
- Bad and good.

19:30.294 --> 19:32.666
No luck on facial recognition
for Mr. Valencia

19:32.838 --> 19:36.289
and Ty couldn't pull any video
off the hard drive from Dom's car.

19:36.467 --> 19:38.009
Too much damage to the platter.

19:38.177 --> 19:39.587
That's bad and bad.

19:39.762 --> 19:43.973
Well, there's no video,
but I managed to salvage the audio.

19:44.141 --> 19:45.884
Here goes.

19:47.686 --> 19:51.387
It's in Spanish.
Grab his arm. Grab his arm.

19:52.274 --> 19:53.899
Help. He's getting loose.

19:56.361 --> 19:58.853
I can't hold him. My gun.

20:00.532 --> 20:02.240
Rafael, wait. I'm coming in.

20:09.917 --> 20:11.031
That's it.

20:39.113 --> 20:40.607
I should've called him.

20:40.781 --> 20:42.240
Made him come with us.

20:46.036 --> 20:48.871
And you know,
he never wanted to drive with me.

20:49.039 --> 20:50.866
He said I took too long to get ready.

20:52.793 --> 20:54.204
You listen.

20:54.628 --> 21:01.129
Guilt is the strongest emotion,
the most powerful emotion we exhibit.

21:01.301 --> 21:06.047
It's so easy to feel
and it's impossible to dismiss.

21:06.223 --> 21:13.353
It's also a strong motivator,
but it tends to cloud our judgement.

21:13.522 --> 21:16.392
I'm talking from experience.

21:20.863 --> 21:22.273
Agent Sullivan.

21:27.161 --> 21:31.205
Oh, God. I don't know how many days
I second-guessed myself

21:31.373 --> 21:33.413
after we lost him.

21:36.503 --> 21:39.374
Remember that you
are a strong woman.

21:39.882 --> 21:43.630
Sometimes it just gets to be too much,
you know?

21:48.599 --> 21:51.553
Yeah. Sometimes.

21:52.269 --> 21:58.272
But don't think for a minute
that they can do it without us.

22:02.196 --> 22:06.027
It's time to follow this through.

22:15.292 --> 22:16.323
Guys, we got a hit.

22:20.047 --> 22:22.004
We got a match
on the dead Latino dude.

22:22.174 --> 22:23.716
Frederico Gomez.

22:23.884 --> 22:24.999
Colombian national.

22:25.177 --> 22:26.636
Here come his vitals.

22:27.179 --> 22:28.839
Crap. They're all in Spanish.

22:29.014 --> 22:32.597
Wanted on multiple charges,
kidnapping for hire,

22:32.768 --> 22:36.682
prueba de vida, proof of life abduction
from Bogotá to Medellin.

22:36.855 --> 22:39.809
Cross-reference for any
known associates named Rafael.

22:39.983 --> 22:42.225
The name screamed in Dom's car.

22:43.695 --> 22:44.940
Rafael Taro.

22:45.113 --> 22:46.572
Has a brother, Jose.

22:46.740 --> 22:49.445
Let me guess,
the Taro brothers make a power trio.

22:49.618 --> 22:53.153
Bigtime. Looks like the Taro brothers
and Frederico were involved

22:53.330 --> 22:55.821
in a number of abductions
in South America,

22:55.999 --> 22:58.241
mostly businessmen snatched
for ransom.

22:58.418 --> 23:00.210
This says hermana.
They have a sister.

23:00.754 --> 23:04.004
Yup. Emigrated to the U.S.
Seven years ago.

23:05.509 --> 23:07.300
She's a nurse at Valencia Hospital.

23:07.469 --> 23:08.928
Closest hospital to where you found.

23:09.096 --> 23:12.050
- Frederico Gomez's body.
- I hate hospitals.

23:12.224 --> 23:14.762
Serial numbers from the IV bag
trace back to a shipment made

23:14.935 --> 23:16.310
to Valencia Hospital.

23:16.478 --> 23:18.636
I hacked into the hospital
personnel database.

23:18.814 --> 23:22.147
Their firewall might as well be made
of cheese from the hospital cafeteria.

23:22.317 --> 23:24.109
Please tell me Claudia lives nearby.

23:24.278 --> 23:27.693
Better. She's a critical care nurse.
Works today.

23:28.574 --> 23:29.605
Let's go.

23:32.035 --> 23:33.909
Oh, yeah.

23:37.374 --> 23:40.079
If she doesn't show up for her shift,
where the hell is she?

23:40.252 --> 23:41.331
Maybe she never left home.

23:41.503 --> 23:43.496
- Eric'll have the address.
- I'll call him.

23:47.092 --> 23:48.123
Claudia Taro?

23:53.682 --> 23:57.430
You're running. That means you have
something to hide. That right, Claudia?

24:09.873 --> 24:11.249
Where's our friend?

24:11.417 --> 24:13.076
I don't know.

24:13.252 --> 24:14.283
I want a lawyer.

24:14.461 --> 24:17.083
You don't need a lawyer.
You need a magician.

24:17.256 --> 24:19.379
It's the only chance
of making your prints disappear

24:19.550 --> 24:21.542
from the vials of morphine we found
at the scene.

24:23.262 --> 24:26.678
Frederico was hurt bad.
He needed to go to the hospital.

24:26.849 --> 24:29.422
But your brothers
wouldn't allow that, would they?

24:29.601 --> 24:32.353
I knew he wasn't going to make it.

24:32.521 --> 24:36.353
But I thought if I just helped them
this one time...

24:36.692 --> 24:40.108
Well, maybe that'd be it. That you'd
never have to see them again.

24:40.404 --> 24:44.022
I never had anything to do
with their business.

24:44.199 --> 24:46.690
I came to L.A.
To get away from them.

24:46.869 --> 24:48.031
But they don't care.

24:48.495 --> 24:51.247
I'm still the little sister.
They want me back home.

24:51.415 --> 24:52.790
What did they say?

24:52.958 --> 24:54.785
Nothing.

24:55.335 --> 24:58.087
Only about a package
they had to deliver.

24:58.255 --> 25:00.746
That package is an NCIS agent.

25:01.467 --> 25:04.254
A package that has a family
and a name, Claudia.

25:04.428 --> 25:07.595
Who, unlike your brothers, has
something to contribute to this world.

25:14.062 --> 25:16.020
- Are you okay?
- Fine.

25:17.274 --> 25:18.305
You saw him.

25:19.735 --> 25:20.980
Didn't you?

25:21.445 --> 25:23.188
Claudia?

25:25.157 --> 25:26.817
What did they do with our friend?

25:29.536 --> 25:31.825
You had a choice
what to become when you came here.

25:31.997 --> 25:33.539
And you became a nurse.

25:34.791 --> 25:37.199
Now, I'm guessing that's
because you wanted to help people.

25:37.794 --> 25:38.993
Wanted to make up for things,

25:39.171 --> 25:42.622
things that maybe your brothers did
that you had nothing to do with.

25:45.677 --> 25:47.587
Our friend helps people too.

25:49.139 --> 25:52.674
People like you
and those that you take care of.

25:52.851 --> 25:56.018
To keep them safe
from people like your brothers.

26:05.822 --> 26:07.696
They brought him in with Frederico.

26:08.408 --> 26:12.951
He'd been shot,
but it was a minor flesh wound.

26:13.497 --> 26:15.536
I patched him up.

26:16.208 --> 26:19.043
When they left,
they took him with them.

26:20.504 --> 26:21.749
That's all I know.

26:22.214 --> 26:23.838
How did they contact you?

26:25.634 --> 26:27.425
On my cell.

26:27.594 --> 26:28.839
What time?

26:30.222 --> 26:32.096
Around 10 p.m.

26:41.149 --> 26:42.181
Eric?

26:42.693 --> 26:44.270
- Give me the love.
- Okay.

26:44.444 --> 26:48.027
213-555-7862.

26:48.198 --> 26:49.361
Running it now.

26:51.702 --> 26:55.320
Oh, so not feeling the love.
It's a burn phone and no GPS.

26:55.497 --> 26:58.948
Best I can do is get you
the nearest cell site.

27:04.548 --> 27:07.086
All right, the call came
from the Alameda Corridor

27:07.259 --> 27:08.374
near the L.A. River.

27:10.971 --> 27:12.631
That's a lot of ground to cover.

27:13.640 --> 27:14.969
Too much ground.

27:43.503 --> 27:45.330
If I had only ridden him harder.

27:45.922 --> 27:48.164
If you'd ridden him any harder,
he may have washed out.

27:48.342 --> 27:50.168
Either way,
this wouldn't have happened.

27:50.344 --> 27:52.170
Maybe, maybe not.

27:53.055 --> 27:55.213
I don't know how
you keep a lid on your feelings.

27:56.350 --> 27:58.093
I just focus on the case.

27:59.269 --> 28:00.977
It's not natural, G.

28:04.066 --> 28:06.438
Neither is that. Heh.

28:06.610 --> 28:10.275
Why you choose to live in this area
is yet another Callen mystery.

28:10.447 --> 28:13.234
- The atmosphere stimulates my brain.
- Yeah?

28:14.076 --> 28:16.483
Mine's about to explode.

28:16.745 --> 28:20.612
L.A.P.D. Sent the description of Dom
and Taros to all the units in this area.

28:20.999 --> 28:23.537
- Nothing yet.
- No. With all the gangs

28:23.710 --> 28:26.462
and street crime they're dealing with,
I wouldn't hold your breath.

28:26.630 --> 28:29.631
The informants won't be of any use.
Taros came up for this job special.

28:29.800 --> 28:31.709
They're not gonna
have connections locally.

28:31.885 --> 28:34.341
- At least not on the street level.
- Even if we find where

28:34.513 --> 28:37.004
they're keeping him, chances are
we have to shoot our way in.

28:37.182 --> 28:40.966
You know the odds of a hostage
surviving in a raid like that?

28:42.479 --> 28:44.472
- Let's call them.
- And say what?

28:45.065 --> 28:47.437
Tell us where you are
and give us our friend back alive?

28:47.818 --> 28:49.276
Something like that.

28:53.615 --> 28:54.646
A swap.

28:56.910 --> 28:58.986
Family ties are strong.

28:59.204 --> 29:00.484
They might just take the risk.

29:01.248 --> 29:03.324
Just gotta get Claudia onboard.

29:03.500 --> 29:06.121
Hmm. Yeah.

29:10.590 --> 29:12.548
You're asking me
to betray my family.

29:12.718 --> 29:14.710
We're asking you to do a good thing.

29:15.679 --> 29:18.086
We're asking you
to help us save our friend.

29:22.936 --> 29:24.264
Claudia,

29:24.438 --> 29:26.929
if someone was at your hospital,

29:27.107 --> 29:29.230
someone hurt really bad

29:29.401 --> 29:31.773
who witnessed a crime committed
by your brothers,

29:33.071 --> 29:34.150
would you help them?

29:34.823 --> 29:37.361
Or would you let them die
to save your brothers from jail?

29:42.247 --> 29:43.990
Please.

30:07.689 --> 30:09.267
Frederico's dead.

30:09.441 --> 30:11.730
Your sister is alive. For now.

30:13.528 --> 30:14.560
Who is this?

30:14.738 --> 30:16.232
Doesn't matter.

30:21.661 --> 30:22.824
What do you want?

30:22.996 --> 30:24.241
A trade.

30:24.623 --> 30:25.654
Let me talk to her.

30:38.678 --> 30:39.710
Raffie?

30:56.404 --> 30:58.278
Claudia. Claudita.

31:02.911 --> 31:04.322
Here's the deal, Raffie.

31:04.496 --> 31:06.821
If you wanna see your sister
back home safe and sound,

31:06.998 --> 31:08.623
you meet me in two hours at the...

31:08.792 --> 31:12.077
No. We do this my way
or we don't do this at all.

31:13.588 --> 31:15.047
I'm waiting, Raffie.

31:15.215 --> 31:19.378
There's an abandoned hospital
on Soto, south of 9th.

31:19.553 --> 31:21.592
There's a boiler room
in the southeast corner.

31:21.763 --> 31:24.681
Be there in one hour.

31:31.064 --> 31:32.095
Thank you.

31:39.990 --> 31:41.021
Thank you.

31:56.723 --> 31:59.261
It was a community hospital
that shut down five years ago.

31:59.434 --> 32:02.269
It's been vacant ever since.
Boiler room is in the basement.

32:02.646 --> 32:05.101
It's 50 feet across, ceiling is 25 high.

32:05.273 --> 32:06.981
Accessibility?

32:07.150 --> 32:09.606
One door on the ground floor,
which is where you will enter.

32:09.778 --> 32:13.823
And there's a staircase that leads
you to the boiler room floor below.

32:13.991 --> 32:16.482
To the north, there's a hallway
that leads to the basement.

32:16.660 --> 32:19.780
Now, the building is six storeys high
and three storeys below ground.

32:19.955 --> 32:21.864
A warren of corridors and rooms.

32:22.040 --> 32:23.582
Lots of places to hide.

32:23.750 --> 32:24.865
Lots.

32:25.043 --> 32:28.495
- Visibility?
- DWP indicate minimal activity.

32:28.672 --> 32:31.163
My guess would be
few low-wattage maintenance fixtures.

32:31.341 --> 32:34.212
- Windows?
- Ten-foot high industrials, east side.

32:34.386 --> 32:36.628
There might be enough illumination
from the moonlight

32:36.805 --> 32:38.963
to make out figures,
but not much else.

32:39.141 --> 32:42.841
Their turf, their staging, their lighting
in a little over 30 minutes.

32:43.020 --> 32:44.977
- Not good.
- Very not good.

32:45.147 --> 32:47.768
What we need is a satellite.

32:49.484 --> 32:51.975
With high resolution optical stabilizers
and infrared.

32:52.154 --> 32:53.945
I'll make a phone call.

32:54.114 --> 32:56.107
Is there anything else?

32:56.616 --> 32:58.775
Uh, luck.

32:59.536 --> 33:00.615
A little luck.

33:00.787 --> 33:02.198
I'll see what I can do.

33:02.372 --> 33:04.080
Kensi, we're gonna need Claudia.

33:18.555 --> 33:20.429
In position, Eric. Which way in?

33:20.724 --> 33:22.218
All right, satellite's online.

33:22.392 --> 33:24.848
I have one heat signature
inside the boiler room.

33:25.020 --> 33:26.395
Only one?

33:26.563 --> 33:27.843
It's a huge complex.

33:28.023 --> 33:30.312
Three subterranean layers,
lots of concrete,

33:30.484 --> 33:33.734
protective shields in X-ray rooms.
Dom could be anywhere.

33:33.904 --> 33:35.446
And so could the other Taro brother.

33:39.993 --> 33:41.156
I'm going in.

33:55.175 --> 33:56.753
Raffie?

33:56.927 --> 33:58.504
I'm here.

33:58.678 --> 34:00.470
Come down.

34:00.639 --> 34:02.050
Steps.

34:03.642 --> 34:05.017
Where's my friend?

34:05.393 --> 34:06.888
Some place safe.

34:07.187 --> 34:08.929
Keep coming.

34:09.313 --> 34:12.730
- Where are you?
- Move to the far end of the room.

34:13.777 --> 34:15.353
Stop.

34:19.157 --> 34:21.648
I delivered my part.
Where's my friend?

34:21.827 --> 34:23.949
Someplace safe.

34:24.246 --> 34:25.408
Let her go.

34:25.580 --> 34:27.489
Or he's not gonna be safe
much longer.

34:28.583 --> 34:31.454
Sam, I have another heat signature
west of the boiler room.

34:31.628 --> 34:33.953
It's weak. Possibly hostile,
probably subterranean.

34:34.130 --> 34:35.161
Okay. Which way in?

34:35.340 --> 34:38.092
The courtyard.
There's a bathroom window.

34:38.260 --> 34:40.003
It's the fifth window in.

34:51.648 --> 34:54.103
- He's not gonna get to Jose in time.
- He'll make it.

34:59.573 --> 35:00.604
Come on now.

35:00.991 --> 35:02.568
Sam, he just turned east.

35:04.286 --> 35:06.325
There's no way east.
There's only a stairway down.

35:06.496 --> 35:08.240
Heat signatures don't show elevation.

35:08.415 --> 35:10.621
He could've gone down to go east.
Take it.

35:17.632 --> 35:18.712
Eric, where is he?

35:18.884 --> 35:20.876
He should be right there.
He's ten feet away.

35:21.052 --> 35:22.381
I got nothing.

35:22.554 --> 35:25.555
Must be on a different level. Wherever.
He's headed for the boiler room.

35:25.849 --> 35:27.473
Take the hallway to your right.
Go fast.

35:30.020 --> 35:32.427
He's on the move, Sam.
Headed north.

35:32.606 --> 35:34.894
You're not getting anything
till I see my buddy.

35:37.027 --> 35:39.352
Why is that heat signature stronger
than the other one?

35:39.529 --> 35:42.199
Not stronger by much,
but it could be closer to the satellite.

35:42.365 --> 35:44.654
Which means he could be...
Sam, he's right above Callen.

35:47.746 --> 35:48.991
Put the gun down!

35:50.957 --> 35:52.950
Put it down!

35:57.797 --> 35:59.422
Go! Go!

35:59.758 --> 36:01.169
Take off the hood.

36:01.343 --> 36:03.631
Buy me a little time, G.

36:09.017 --> 36:11.804
I didn't think
you'd be bringing Claudia.

36:12.854 --> 36:14.479
What are you? FBI?

36:14.648 --> 36:16.474
You're L.A.P.D.

36:16.691 --> 36:17.936
NCIS.

36:18.109 --> 36:20.945
I just wanna know what name to put
on the tombstone.

36:21.821 --> 36:24.988
Diversion in three, two, one.

36:47.556 --> 36:49.180
Cover me.

37:13.540 --> 37:14.868
Where is he, Raffie?

37:15.041 --> 37:16.452
Where is he?

37:18.753 --> 37:20.082
I want a deal.

37:22.882 --> 37:24.341
What do you want, Raffie?

37:24.509 --> 37:26.217
Not for me.

37:26.720 --> 37:28.546
For Claudia.

37:33.435 --> 37:35.677
You don't take her in.

37:37.314 --> 37:40.268
You don't put nothing on her record.

37:42.736 --> 37:44.194
You never even met her.

37:46.698 --> 37:48.737
You have my word.

37:48.908 --> 37:50.153
She walks.

37:51.161 --> 37:54.993
Your friend is in San Bernardino.

37:58.460 --> 37:59.491
Hook Creek Road.

38:01.504 --> 38:03.296
There's a blue van.

38:03.673 --> 38:05.465
We took the money.

38:06.760 --> 38:08.384
We left him inside.

38:08.803 --> 38:10.298
Why did they want him?

38:11.264 --> 38:13.056
I don't know.

38:15.268 --> 38:16.679
I never saw them.

38:20.982 --> 38:24.517
L... I never met them.

38:56.893 --> 38:58.850
Sam, Kensi.

38:59.020 --> 39:00.051
Go.

40:10.425 --> 40:15.336
At the end of the day,
we all deal with things in our own way,

40:15.513 --> 40:17.422
don't we?

40:28.568 --> 40:30.644
Good night, Mr. Callen.
