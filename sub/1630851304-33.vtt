>> THEY DIDN'T NEED TO DO THAT.

RIGHT NOW I'M PISSED.

01:45.071 --> 01:47.607
>> Announcer: AND BIG "D" WAS
WORRIED HE MIGHT BE THE ODD MAN

01:47.674 --> 01:48.308
OUT.

>> MY ATTITUDE IS NOT WITH YOU.

>> IT'S JUST NO ONE TELL-- NO
ONE TOLD ME WHAT HE WAS GOING

01:57.584 --> 01:58.785
ON.

01:58.852 --> 02:01.087
WITH THEM PULLING THIS STUNT AS
THEY DID, I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT

02:01.154 --> 02:02.355
MEANS FOR A FUTURE IN THIS GAME.

02:02.422 --> 02:06.292

INSURMOUNTABLE.

02:18.304 --> 02:21.674
THIS H.O.H. VERY WELL COULD BE
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ME

02:21.741 --> 02:26.446
WINNING $750,000, AND NOW I FEEL
LIKE I'M IN A VERY GOOD

02:26.513 --> 02:27.514

BATTLE FOR THREE-QUARTERS OF A

02:54.641 --> 02:55.441
MILLION DOLLARS.

>> THIS NOMINATION CEREMONY IS
ADJOURNED.

03:14.427 --> 03:20.366
♪ ♪ ♪
I HAVE NOMINATED KYLAND AND

03:20.433 --> 03:21.601
AZAH.

03:21.668 --> 03:24.938
MY GOAL THIS WEEK IS SIMPLY TO
ENSURE MYSELF AND DEREK F. MAKE

03:25.004 --> 03:26.406
IT TO THE FINAL THREE.

03:26.472 --> 03:29.576
THIS VETO COMPETITION IS BY FAR
THE MOST IMPORTANT OF THE SUMMER

03:29.642 --> 03:32.345
BECAUSE THIS VETO COMPETITION
DETERMINES WHO GOES TO THE FINAL

03:32.412 --> 03:36.182
THREE, AND I INTEND TO DO
EVERYTHING IN MY POWER TO WIN

03:36.249 --> 03:36.583
THIS VETO.

03:36.649 --> 03:38.351
THERE YOU GO.

03:38.418 --> 03:40.553
.SORRY.

03:40.620 --> 03:43.990
>> I'VE NEVER BEEN THIS STRESSED
OUT BEFORE BECAUSE THE ONLY

03:44.057 --> 03:49.262
THING THAT MATTERS THIS WEEK IS
THE VETO BECAUSE THE VETO WINNER

03:49.329 --> 03:52.532
DECIDES WHO CASTS THE SOLE VOTE
TO EVICT.

03:52.599 --> 03:57.804
IT'S ESSENTIALLY WIN THIS VETO,
OR LOSE THIS GAME.

03:57.870 --> 03:58.871
>> YOUR PICTURE IS BLOWN UP.

03:58.938 --> 04:01.007
>> IT LOOKS NICE BLOWN UP.

04:01.074 --> 04:02.342
>> IT LOOKS GREAT.

04:02.408 --> 04:07.480
>> I'M HAPPY NOT TO BE ON THE
BLOCK BUT I'M ALSO SAD.

04:07.547 --> 04:09.115
I'M IN A WEIRD SPOT.

04:09.182 --> 04:14.187
I WANT TO GO TO WANT FINAL THREE
WITH XAVIER AND I MIGHT HAVE TO

04:14.253 --> 04:15.955
SAY GOOD-BYE TO AZAH AT THE END
OF THIS WEEK.

04:16.022 --> 04:17.223
>> ARE YOU DONE?

04:17.290 --> 04:21.628
>> IT'S GOING TO CRUSH MY HEART
BECAUSE SHE'S MY BEST FRIEND IN

04:21.694 --> 04:23.830
THE GAME BUT I HAVE TO DO WHAT'S
BEST FOR MY GAME.

04:23.896 --> 04:25.565
>> I LOOK UP THERE.

04:25.632 --> 04:28.468
UP UNTIL NOW, I MADE IT THE
ENTIRE SEASON WITHOUT BEING

04:28.534 --> 04:32.372
NOMINATED AND IT'S SOBERING,
BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE I MIGHT GO

04:32.438 --> 04:33.573
HOME.

04:33.640 --> 04:36.009
I KNOW WINNING THE VETO IS THE
ONLY WAY I'LL BE ABLE TO STAY

04:36.075 --> 04:37.176
SAFE THIS WEEK.

04:37.243 --> 04:38.878
BUT I ALSO NEED TO KNOW WHERE I
STAND WITH THE REST OF THE

04:38.945 --> 04:39.379
HOUSE.

04:39.445 --> 04:42.015
>> HOW YOU FEELING?

04:42.081 --> 04:43.216
>> I'M OKAY.

04:43.282 --> 04:46.319
I HAVE A CLOSE RELATIONSHIP WITH
EVERY SINGLE PERSON IN THIS

04:46.386 --> 04:46.786
HOUSE.

04:46.853 --> 04:48.721
I CAN'T SAY THAT.

04:48.788 --> 04:49.656
>> NO, I CAN'T.

04:49.722 --> 04:50.657
I DON'T KNOW.

04:50.723 --> 04:52.058
WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT KY.

04:52.125 --> 04:54.761
WE ALL KNOW KY IS A WILD CARD.

04:54.827 --> 04:58.331
>> DID YOU COMMIT TO A FINAL
THREE WITH THEM?

04:58.398 --> 05:03.703
>> NO.

05:03.770 --> 05:06.105
>> WE'RE GOING TO BE MUCH MORE
CUT THROAT.

05:06.172 --> 05:09.075
ONE THING I'M NOT TRYING TO DO
IS HAVE EITHER OF YOUR NAMES IN

05:09.142 --> 05:09.609
MY MOUTH.

05:09.676 --> 05:10.476
>> I AGREE WITH THAT.

05:10.543 --> 05:11.110
>> OKAY.

05:11.177 --> 05:12.378
>> JUST BE UPFRONT WITH ME.

05:12.445 --> 05:14.781
>> I AM.

05:14.847 --> 05:19.352
IT'S-- IT'S A VERY UNCOMFORTABLE
CONVERSATION, BUT I CAN TELL YOU

05:19.419 --> 05:22.855
THE TWO DEALS THEY HAVE MADE.

05:22.922 --> 05:24.157
>> OKAY.

05:24.223 --> 05:31.197
>> ME AND "X" HAVE A FINAL TWO
FROM DAY ONE, FROM WEEK TWO,

05:31.264 --> 05:35.935
WHEN KY WAS H.O.H., I MADE A
DEAL.

05:36.002 --> 05:38.771
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WANT TO MAKE
A FINAL TWO DEAL.

05:38.838 --> 05:42.942
I'M JUST SAYING WE CAN MAKE THE
DEAL, AND THEN WE CAN REVISIT IT

05:43.009 --> 05:44.711
AND BE LIKE, "TIME TO CHECK IN.

05:44.777 --> 05:46.979
HOW ARE YOU?"
JUST SAYING.

05:47.046 --> 05:48.548
>> I LIKE THAT.

05:48.614 --> 05:49.482
I'M DOWN WITH THAT.

05:49.549 --> 05:50.450
>> DAMN.

05:50.516 --> 05:52.752
>> I HAVE HAD THESE DEALS SINCE
THE BEGINNING.

05:52.819 --> 05:55.455
>> THAT'S ESSENTIALLY A FINAL
THREE WITH THE GUYS, THOUGH, YOU

05:55.521 --> 05:56.656
KNOW THAT, RIGHT?

05:56.723 --> 06:03.563
>> I WAS SETTING MYSELF UP TO BE
SAFE WITH EITHER ONE OR TWO.

06:03.629 --> 06:06.099
I NEVER DID THIS.

06:06.165 --> 06:07.166
IF THAT MAKES SENSE.

06:07.233 --> 06:09.969
>> BUT IT'S ESSENTIALLY A FINAL
THREE WITH THE GUYS.

06:10.036 --> 06:11.537
I AM HONESTLY SHOCKED.

06:11.604 --> 06:16.209
I HAVE KNOWN PRETTY MUCH ABOUT
ALL THE BIG "D'S" PLAN, UP UNTIL

06:16.275 --> 06:16.943
THIS MOMENT.

06:17.009 --> 06:19.045
I'M HONESTLY AT A LOSS FOR
WORDS.

06:19.112 --> 06:24.050
>> COULD HAVE NOT SENT HANNAH
HOME AND JUST SENT A GUY HOME.

06:24.117 --> 06:25.885
PROBABLY SET MYSELF UP BETTER
THAN HOW I AM NOW.

06:25.952 --> 06:27.754
>> WE'RE IN THE BEST POSITION.

06:27.820 --> 06:30.857
>> IT'S NOT US ANYMORE, BOO.

06:30.923 --> 06:32.725
IT'S YOU.

06:32.792 --> 06:37.029
I DON'T HAVE A FINAL TWO WITH
BIG "D."

06:37.096 --> 06:42.135
WE'RE JUST PEOPLE WHO HAVE HAD
EACH OTHER'S BACK THIS ENTIRE

06:42.201 --> 06:43.269
TIME.

06:43.336 --> 06:45.338
BUT THIS JUST CEMENTS THE FACT
THAT THE ONLY PERSON I CAN

06:45.404 --> 06:46.439
DEPEND ON IS MYSELF.

06:46.506 --> 06:50.977
AND I HAVE TO DO WHAT I CAN TO
GET TO FINAL THREE.

06:51.043 --> 06:54.647
CALL IT WHAT IT IS OPIN.

06:54.714 --> 06:58.785
IF I DON'T WIN VETO, I'M GOING
HOME.

06:58.851 --> 06:59.986
>> HOW YOU DOING?

07:00.052 --> 07:00.953
>> I'M DOING GOOD.

07:01.020 --> 07:01.754
HOW ARE YOU?

07:01.821 --> 07:02.855
>> STRESSED.

07:02.922 --> 07:03.589
>> STRESSED?

07:03.656 --> 07:08.928
>> I'M JUST BEAT UP BY AZAH.

07:08.995 --> 07:12.999
THERE'S A POTENTIAL CHANCE I'M
GOING TO SEND MY FRIEND HOME.

07:13.065 --> 07:15.735
IT'S JUST HARD.

07:15.802 --> 07:19.639
SOMEONE WHO IS... RIDE OR DIE
FOR YOU.

07:19.705 --> 07:23.342
AND TELL HER, YOU KNOW, IF IT
COMES DOWN TO IT, I-- I HAVE TO

07:23.409 --> 07:27.580
SEND YOU HOME BECAUSE I MADE
DEALS THAT I SAID I WOULDN'T GO

07:27.647 --> 07:28.381
BACK ON.

07:28.447 --> 07:28.881
IT'S JUST HARD.

07:28.948 --> 07:34.187
THAT'S ALL.

07:34.253 --> 07:35.755
I HAVE MADE MY BED.

07:35.822 --> 07:38.491
YOU AND ME WERE GOING TO MAKE IT
TO THE END.

07:38.558 --> 07:42.595
SO I'M JUST TRYING TO MAKE SURE
I'M NOT SHOOTING MYSELF IN THE

07:42.662 --> 07:43.830
FOOT.

07:43.896 --> 07:47.033
I KNOW THAT I HAVE MY FINAL TWO
DEAL WITH XAVIER, SO I WANT TO

07:47.099 --> 07:51.170
MAKE SURE THAT ME AND KYLAND ARE
GOOD BEFORE I EVEN THINK ABOUT

07:51.237 --> 07:54.273
CONSIDERING SENDING HOME MY BEST
FRIEND IN THE GAME, AZAH.

07:54.340 --> 07:58.311
BECAUSE I NEED TO MAKE SURE THEY
END UP IN FINALE NIGHT, NO

07:58.377 --> 07:59.545
MATTER WHO DECIDES TO TAKE ME.

07:59.612 --> 08:04.417
>> I FEEL LIKE RIGHT NOW, YOU'RE
HAVING A CONVERSATION WITH ME

08:04.483 --> 08:06.352
ABOUT FEARS OF MAKING IT TO TWO.

08:06.419 --> 08:08.487
AND RIGHT NOW, I'M JUST TRYING
TO GET TO THREE.

08:08.554 --> 08:12.525
>> WHAT I'M GETTING AT IS TO
MAKE SURE OUR DEAL THAT WE MADE

08:12.592 --> 08:13.459
TO THE END STICKS.

08:13.526 --> 08:15.294
>> I RECOGNIZE THAT.

08:15.361 --> 08:16.896
WE'RE IN DIFFERENT POSITIONS.

08:16.963 --> 08:18.431
I'M MORE VULNERABLE THAN YOU
ARE.

08:18.497 --> 08:21.133
I DON'T THINK IT'S YOUR
INTENTION TO LEVERAGE IT,

08:21.200 --> 08:22.768
BECAUSE I'M IN A VULNERABLE
SPOT.

08:22.835 --> 08:24.804
IT IS, LIKE, A LEVERAGED
QUESTION.

08:24.871 --> 08:27.940
IF NOMINATIONS STAY THE SAME,
THEN DEREK IS GOING TO BE THE

08:28.007 --> 08:33.412
SOLE VOTE AS TO WHO GOES WITH
HIM AND XAVIER TO THE FINAL

08:33.479 --> 08:34.747
THREE.

08:34.814 --> 08:39.418
AND IT FEELS LIKE HE'S USING
THIS MOMENT TO ALMOST THREATEN

08:39.485 --> 08:44.724
ME INTO REASSURING HIM BEFORE HE
COMMITS TO BRINGING ME TO FINAL

08:44.790 --> 08:45.491
THREE.

08:45.558 --> 08:47.059
>> LISTEN, I MADE MY DEAL WITH
YOU.

08:47.126 --> 08:48.227
>> YEAH.

08:48.294 --> 08:50.963
>> AND I JUST WANTED TO JUST
MAKE SURE ME AND YOU ARE STILL

08:51.030 --> 08:51.631
GOOD.

08:51.697 --> 08:52.465
THAT WAS MY ONLY THING, SO...

08:52.531 --> 08:54.800
>> IT'S HARD TO SEE PAST THIS
WEEK.

08:54.867 --> 08:59.305
>> KYLAND IS JUST MAKING ME FEEL
LIKE I CAN'T TRUST HIM.

08:59.372 --> 09:01.407
AND THEN HE'S NOT GIVING ME A
STRAIGHT ANSWER.

09:01.474 --> 09:02.842
IT'S A YES OR NO.

09:02.909 --> 09:03.776
SO WHAT IS IT?

09:03.843 --> 09:07.280
ARE WE GOOD TO THE FINAL TWO, OR
ARE WE NOT?

09:07.346 --> 09:11.250
>> RIGHT NOW, I'VE HAD MY WORLD
ROCKED IN THIS GAME.

09:11.317 --> 09:18.491
I THINK ALL OF US HAVE.

09:18.557 --> 09:20.026
>> CAN I ASK YOU A QUESTION?

09:20.092 --> 09:21.294
>> SURE.

09:21.360 --> 09:25.364
>> I DON'T KNOW IF YOU DECIDED
THIS YET, BUT DO YOU DESIRE TO

09:25.431 --> 09:29.769
BE AT FINAL THREE WITH
COMPETITIVE PEOPLE?

09:29.835 --> 09:35.041
>> UHM, I DESIRE TO BE IN FINAL
THREE WITH WHOEVER I FEEL WILL

09:35.107 --> 09:36.943
BEST REPRESENT "BIG BROTHER'S"
FIRST AFRICAN AMERICAN WINNER.

09:37.009 --> 09:41.814
AND I HONESTLY THINK ALL FOUR OF
US CAN DO THAT.

09:41.881 --> 09:47.253
WITH KYLAND AND I, I KNOW HE'S
ALSO FELT A COMPETITIVE RIVALRY

09:47.320 --> 09:48.421
WITH ME.

09:48.487 --> 09:52.692
I THINK HE HAS A DESIRE TO,
LIKE, BRING COMPETITORS TO THE

09:52.758 --> 09:53.826
END.

09:53.893 --> 09:56.262
HE'D USE ME AS THE STRONGEST
COMPET INTERESTOP I THINK HE

KYLAND WOULD BE EPIC, BUT WILL

40:49.680 --> 40:51.182

PLAN?

40:51.248 --> 40:52.416
THAT'S THE BIG QUESTION.

40:52.483 --> 40:55.486
I HAVE TO DECIDE ON WHETHER OR
NOT I BELIEVE BIG "D" IS WILLING

40:55.553 --> 40:59.924
TO TAKE THAT SHOT.

40:59.990 --> 41:02.660
