it's 'cause of white women

-To hump.

Do you know who Barbecue Becky is?
All right, Barbecue Becky...

03:12.233 --> 03:14.611
was a white woman
from Oakland, California,

03:14.694 --> 03:16.070
and she was a snitch.

03:16.154 --> 03:17.864
[laughter]

03:18.406 --> 03:21.492
And most white women
from Oakland, California are snitches.

03:22.243 --> 03:23.953
But she was a super snitch.

03:24.412 --> 03:26.706
She had a cellphone
with an external battery cord

03:26.789 --> 03:28.791
going into a motorcycle battery.

03:29.042 --> 03:30.501

Bitch was on the phone with the police
for two hours

with 100% battery life.

03:35.715 --> 03:36.799
[continued laughter]

03:37.091 --> 03:39.594
Who the fuck ever has 100% battery life?

03:39.844 --> 03:43.431
Soon as you wake up in the morning,
"Fuck, I just woke up, I'm on 85%."

Go outside, "1%?
Fuck that, I ain't going out with 1%."

03:53.107 --> 03:54.817
Barbecue Becky on the phone
with the police,

03:54.901 --> 03:57.654

04:04.035 --> 04:05.036
[gasping]

04:05.954 --> 04:09.332

She said, "They're barbecuing!"

Police is like, "What?"
She said, "With black charcoals!"

04:14.879 --> 04:17.507
I thought this was the dumbest shit
I ever heard in my life.

04:17.590 --> 04:19.092
I had to do more research.

04:19.175 --> 04:20.969
You know why Barbecue Becky was so upset?

04:21.052 --> 04:24.722
Because the black people invited her
to the barbecue the year before.

04:25.223 --> 04:27.809
They said barbecue...
You can come to the barbecue.

04:28.434 --> 04:30.144

She said, "What should I bring?"

04:37.068 --> 04:39.654
They said, "Whatever you want, bitch,
just come to the barbecue."

04:39.737 --> 04:42.240
BBQ Becky showed up the next day
to the black barbecue

04:42.323 --> 04:44.492
with some white people potato salad.

04:44.575 --> 04:45.743
[oohs and laughter]

04:51.666 --> 04:54.585
She had olive oil and hummus
and yogurt and shit.

04:55.336 --> 04:58.631
That shit ain't had no mustard, no relish,
no mayonnaise...

05:07.515 --> 05:09.517

05:10.018 --> 05:13.604
I'm a big music fan, man. You like music?

05:24.282 --> 05:26.951

05:45.178 --> 05:46.220
Send me the link."

05:46.304 --> 05:48.806
A fuck tape is a tape
that you fuck off of.

05:49.557 --> 05:51.517
It helps you with your rhythm,
your stamina.

05:51.601 --> 05:54.270

Just an uncoordinated dick with no rhythm.

06:13.873 --> 06:16.584
Then they came out with fuck CDs.
You know what a fuck CD is?

06:16.667 --> 06:19.003

You ever scratch your CD,
that shit will always skip

06:29.680 --> 06:30.598

'Cause black people, we want to know
what level gay you are.

09:40.454 --> 09:41.664
You can't just say, "I'm gay."

09:41.747 --> 09:44.375
They like, "You gay?
You gay-gay-gay-gay-gay-gay?

09:44.959 --> 09:47.336
-How many gays are you, motherfucker?"
-[audience laughs]

09:48.754 --> 09:52.091
But I respect him, 'cause when he came out
and said he was gay,

09:52.174 --> 09:55.386
he responded... Everybody was upset.
He said,

09:55.469 --> 09:57.471
"I thought it was obvious."

09:57.597 --> 09:58.431
[laughter]

09:58.723 --> 10:01.267
That's some gangster-ass shit,
right there.

10:01.350 --> 10:04.395
And it was obvious to me, I don't know
why it wasn't obvious to the world.

10:04.478 --> 10:05.896
I knew Lil Nas was gay

10:05.980 --> 10:07.982
because the first time I heard him
in the interview,

10:08.065 --> 10:09.900
he started his sentences off like this...

10:09.984 --> 10:11.027
[clicks tongue] "Um..."

10:11.319 --> 10:12.987
[audience laughs]

10:14.030 --> 10:15.031
[applause]

10:15.281 --> 10:16.574

10:17.158 --> 10:18.993
[effeminate] <i>"Yas!</i>

10:19.869 --> 10:21.662
Yas, Nas!

10:22.288 --> 10:23.664
Yas!"

10:23.748 --> 10:24.999
[laughter]

10:25.833 --> 10:28.461
And then he got even more gangster.
He tweeted the next day,

10:28.544 --> 10:31.547
'cause everybody was fucking with him,
he said, and I quote,

10:32.173 --> 10:34.091
"The next one of you niggas..."

10:34.842 --> 10:36.636
I was like, "This Tupac, nigga!"

10:36.719 --> 10:37.678
[audience laughs]

10:37.845 --> 10:41.432
He said, "The next one of you niggas
say some offensive shit to me,

10:41.515 --> 10:42.975
I'm going to kiss you."

10:43.392 --> 10:44.644
[oohs and laughter]

10:44.852 --> 10:48.272
And guess what, ain't nobody say shit!

10:48.356 --> 10:49.190
[cheering]

10:49.273 --> 10:52.026
Them niggas was quiet as a motherfucker.
Nas was like,

10:52.109 --> 10:53.861
[gruff vocals]

10:53.944 --> 10:56.280

10:57.782 --> 10:59.617

11:11.087 --> 11:13.964
Where you going to raise
this bitch-ass horse? [chuckles]

11:14.048 --> 11:16.467
Can you imagine that shit?
Horses in the hood?

11:16.676 --> 11:17.927
[laughing]

11:18.135 --> 11:19.595
Could you imagine horses in the hood?

11:19.679 --> 11:22.390
It would be horseshit
on every goddamn corner.

11:23.224 --> 11:25.267
'Cause black people don't pick up shit.

11:25.726 --> 11:29.021
You don't know the last time
you picked up some shit. Niggas don't...

11:29.105 --> 11:31.982
Black people don't pick up no shit.
You better hope it rains,

11:32.066 --> 11:34.276
that's the only way
that shit's getting off that block.

11:34.360 --> 11:35.486

-If it don't rain,

11:35.569 --> 11:37.571
the whole neighborhood going to be shitty.

11:38.239 --> 11:41.909
White people love to pick up shit.
You motherfuckers love to pick up shit.

11:42.368 --> 11:44.537
White people can't wait to pick up shit.

11:44.829 --> 11:47.540
-They go shopping for shit bags.
-[continued laughter]

11:47.623 --> 11:51.419
Them blue bags,
they read the box and shit, biodegradable,

11:51.669 --> 11:53.504
environmentally friendly.

11:54.839 --> 11:58.092
They can't wait to... They got
the little pouch to put the shit bags.

11:58.634 --> 12:01.137
They got the shit-bag fucking purse.

12:01.846 --> 12:04.056
They can't wait to rip off a sheet.

12:04.306 --> 12:07.351
You probably got some blue sheets
in your pocket right now.

12:07.435 --> 12:09.478
They can't wait to be like...

[audience laughs]

12:10.604 --> 12:11.522
[imitates whoosh]

12:12.732 --> 12:15.735
You know how much pressure it is
being walked by a white dog owner?

12:16.318 --> 12:19.405
You can't just enjoy your walk,
you gotta shit immediately.

12:20.239 --> 12:22.867
It ain't no, "Sit, Bruno."
It's like, "Shit, Bruno!"

12:22.992 --> 12:24.118

12:24.410 --> 12:26.871
You know how stressed out
that dog is? [laughs]

12:27.455 --> 12:30.499
You know that motherfucker like this,
"Here come this motherfucker with..."

'Cause once a dog do this move right here,
ain't no coming back.

12:34.837 --> 12:37.506
Ain't no...
A human can't come back from this shit.

You ever see
a black person walk their dog?

13:07.745 --> 13:10.664
Their dog start to shit, they act like
they don't even know the dog no more.

-I know you got a rescue dog.
-[audience laughs]

13:35.231 --> 13:38.317
I know you got... Every white friend
of mine got a rescue dog.

13:38.859 --> 13:40.861
I don't have a problem with rescue dogs.

13:40.945 --> 13:42.947
I have a problem with rescue dog owners.

13:43.864 --> 13:45.866
'Cause they sensitive as shit!

13:46.033 --> 13:48.702

That's all you...
You looking at the dog like this.

You like,
"What type of dog are you, nigga?"

[uproarious laughter]

14:11.809 --> 14:13.435
[Donnell laughs]

14:13.936 --> 14:16.105
Then you ask the owner,
"What kind of dog is it?"

14:16.188 --> 14:19.066
"It's a rescue." "Bitch,
what breed is that motherfucking dog?"

14:20.109 --> 14:23.028
I don't give a fuck where you found
this three-legged paralyzed-ass dog.

14:23.153 --> 14:24.196

[laughs] I was just trying to figure out
what kind of dog this punk-ass dog is.

14:29.451 --> 14:32.121
White people have insurance
for their motherfucking dogs.

14:32.830 --> 14:36.250
Black don't have no insurance. [laughs]
You a black dog owner, your dog...

15:37.019 --> 15:39.271
All these plastic-ass straws and shit.

They trying to ban straws

I didn't believe this shit
and I didn't think it was real

15:55.037 --> 15:57.873
until I went to...
I went to fucking Montreal, Canada.

15:57.957 --> 15:58.999
I went to this bar, right?

15:59.083 --> 16:02.336
And I walked in and I said,
"Can I get a Tito's and tonic?"

16:02.962 --> 16:06.090
Right, white lady came back,
she gave me a Tito's and tonic

16:06.715 --> 16:08.550
and the shit didn't have a straw in it.

16:09.301 --> 16:11.345

That's what I said. She said, "You didn't
hear about the turtle?" I said...

16:40.249 --> 16:42.084
There was these marine biologists,
right, sir?

16:42.167 --> 16:46.130
All right, first off, marine biologists
are always, always, <i>always...</i>

going to be white people.

16:48.007 --> 16:49.049

16:49.258 --> 16:52.511
I'm not racist, but you never gonna see
a black marine biologist

16:52.594 --> 16:56.390
because black people like
fried fish sandwiches way too much

16:56.765 --> 17:00.436
to catch and release, motherfucker.
I'm gonna catch and grease that bitch.

17:00.519 --> 17:01.520

17:01.729 --> 17:04.606
White people love to fucking rescue shit.

17:04.690 --> 17:05.816
They catch the fucking fish,

17:05.899 --> 17:08.318
they put tags on 'em, they swim with 'em.

[yelling] "Bye, Molly!"

17:18.662 --> 17:20.664

17:23.667 --> 17:26.795
So, these marine biologists
rescue this turtle

17:26.879 --> 17:30.007
and they do an examination of the turtle
and they notice that the turtle

17:30.090 --> 17:31.467
had a straw in his nose, right?

17:31.550 --> 17:34.595
And everybody's upset.
"Fuck! Humans are assholes.

17:35.137 --> 17:37.931
I can't believe they would do this
to this fucking turtle!"

17:38.057 --> 17:39.099
[laughter]

17:39.183 --> 17:42.311
Right, and they tried to pull it out.
It wouldn't come out, they took pliers,

fucking turtle's nose
started bleeding and shit.

17:44.438 --> 17:46.899
They was like,

17:47.066 --> 17:51.195
And everybody was upset that this turtle
had a straw in its nose.

17:52.613 --> 17:54.740
But nobody was upset that this turtle

17:54.823 --> 17:57.493
had a motherfucking cocaine problem,
motherfucker!
