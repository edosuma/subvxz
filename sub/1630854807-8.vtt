Yeah.

enter the phrase incorrectly

04:14.337 --> 04:16.256

it locks out forever.

07:22.942 --> 07:24.778
and how they didn't have
enough piercings.

07:24.778 --> 07:27.072
Yeah,
that does sound like us.

07:27.072 --> 07:29.074
I shouldn't have
pressed that button.

07:29.074 --> 07:31.701
Playtime is over.
I am being decisive.

07:31.701 --> 07:33.078
We gotta pay that ransom.

07:33.078 --> 07:35.372
- Just, you know, we can't.
- Why?

07:35.372 --> 07:37.916
Because of the company policy?
I'm the CEO.

07:37.916 --> 07:39.501
I am the company.
So guess what?

07:39.501 --> 07:42.253
- Poof. No more policy.
- Yes, right.

07:42.253 --> 07:44.923
It's just, with all due respect
to the power of poof,

07:44.923 --> 07:46.883
without the shield
of a corporate mandate,

07:46.883 --> 07:48.009
you know, I'm the one
that's on the hook

07:48.009 --> 07:49.260
for having authorized
the payments.

07:49.260 --> 07:51.096
Right. So, great.
You can do it.

07:51.096 --> 07:54.683
Technically I can,
but I...won't.

07:54.683 --> 07:56.101
What?

07:56.101 --> 07:57.477
Well, what you're really
asking me to do

07:57.477 --> 07:59.062
is put my name
to a series of payments

07:59.062 --> 08:01.022
to people who, for all we know,
might be terrorists.

08:01.022 --> 08:02.273
We don't know.
You know,

08:02.273 --> 08:03.650
I could be breaking
any number of laws.

08:03.650 --> 08:05.443
They have all my emails.

08:05.443 --> 08:07.654
Do you realize how bad
that would be if they got out?

08:07.654 --> 08:09.239
I'd be humiliated.

08:09.239 --> 08:11.366
With all due respect to that,
and I don't want you to be

08:11.366 --> 08:14.202
humiliated at all, but equally
on the other side of the coin,

08:14.202 --> 08:16.037
I don't want to go to jail.

08:16.037 --> 08:18.248
So you have to admit that
it is kind of a close call.

08:18.248 --> 08:20.250
Are you really saying
no to me right now?

08:20.250 --> 08:21.876
- Is that what's happening here?
- No.

08:21.876 --> 08:23.211
Apart from that one.
It doesn't count.

08:23.211 --> 08:24.462
Look, what I'm trying
to say is--

08:24.462 --> 08:26.131
Because to be honest,
the fact that you

08:26.131 --> 08:27.424
aren't brownnosing me
right now,

08:27.424 --> 08:30.218
- it's very, very disorienting.
- I know. I know.

08:30.218 --> 08:32.137
It's weird for me, too.

08:32.137 --> 08:33.930
Retrace your steps mentally.

08:33.930 --> 08:35.140
Where were you
when you changed it?

08:35.140 --> 08:37.267
- What were you doing? Who--
- Oh, oh,

08:37.267 --> 08:39.144
Fedora.
I was wearing a fedora.

08:39.144 --> 08:40.979
- There you go. A fedora?
- Ew.

08:40.979 --> 08:42.856
It's the exact same one
Bruno Mars wears.

08:42.856 --> 08:44.482
First things first, you need
to get rid of that damn hat.

08:44.482 --> 08:46.609
Wait, wait, wait.
Bruno Mars.

08:46.609 --> 08:47.861
Bruno.
Sacha Baron Cohen.

08:47.861 --> 08:49.988
Oh, my God.
I think I remember it.

08:49.988 --> 08:52.699
I like to make sexy time.

08:52.699 --> 08:53.742
- Oh.
- Nice.

08:53.742 --> 08:54.868
[buzzer blares]
Ah.

08:54.868 --> 08:58.246
Oh, uh, my wife
likes to make sexy time.

08:58.246 --> 08:59.998
No, It's not "my wife
likes to make sexy time."

08:59.998 --> 09:01.416
Have you even seen the movie?

09:01.416 --> 09:03.752
- OK, Is it a person?
- Yep.

09:03.752 --> 09:05.170
Definitely not an animal.
Wait, that's doesn't count.

09:05.170 --> 09:06.504
- That doesn't count.
- Yes, it does.

09:06.504 --> 09:08.173
So if you go into
the negative on "Jeopardy!",

09:08.173 --> 09:09.799
do you have to pay them?

09:09.799 --> 09:12.093
If you're worried,
I just wouldn't go on the show.

09:12.093 --> 09:14.304
So is it bigger than a dog?

09:14.304 --> 09:16.181
Yes, obviously.
It's a person.

09:16.181 --> 09:17.349
Sorry, I just thought
like, you know,

09:17.349 --> 09:19.017
what about like a--
like a big dog?

09:19.017 --> 09:20.977
You can't give
an invisibility cloak

09:20.977 --> 09:22.228
to boy that age.

09:22.228 --> 09:23.646
They're gonna use it
for sex stuff.

09:23.646 --> 09:25.023
- You would have?
- Yeah.

09:25.023 --> 09:26.274
Of course, I would have.
Everybody boy would have.

09:26.274 --> 09:28.360
And Harry did, too.
It was just offscreen.

09:28.360 --> 09:29.861
If you wanted
to know if it's a big dog,

09:29.861 --> 09:31.196
say is it a big dog?

09:31.196 --> 09:32.280
I'm thinking
of the next question, Sadie.

09:32.280 --> 09:33.948
I already said it's a person.

09:33.948 --> 09:36.368
- So kill Elliot.
- What about Wesley?

09:36.368 --> 09:37.952
Uhh.

09:37.952 --> 09:39.913
I'm gonna marry him
just for the money.

09:39.913 --> 09:41.206
OK.

09:41.206 --> 09:42.374
Never having sex
with him ever.

09:42.374 --> 09:43.875
And I just
don't understand

09:43.875 --> 09:44.918
how a little girl
is allowed to have

09:44.918 --> 09:46.503
a dog the size of a house.

09:46.503 --> 09:48.713
And if you read those books,
like, really read them,

09:48.713 --> 09:51.966
you realize that Clifford
is constantly killing people.

09:51.966 --> 09:53.927
Like, his tail
is swatting the mailman

09:53.927 --> 09:55.679
300 feet through the air.

09:55.679 --> 09:56.846
Got it.
Is it Katherine?

09:56.846 --> 09:58.390
- Yes.
- Yes.

09:58.390 --> 09:59.641
Finally.

09:59.641 --> 10:02.310
- Ah, that is so pathetic.
- Yeah, a little bit.

10:02.310 --> 10:04.104
[laughter]

10:05.897 --> 10:07.524
Oh, it's stopping.
It stopped.

10:07.524 --> 10:10.360
- Maybe it's on a timer.
- Thank God.

10:10.360 --> 10:12.153
I've been dying
to stretch my legs.

10:12.153 --> 10:14.489
- Ohh.
- Ooh. Phew.

10:14.489 --> 10:15.949
[buzzer blares]
[fan whooshing]

10:15.949 --> 10:17.826
- Whoa!
- Oh! Oh, my God!

10:17.826 --> 10:20.704
- OK, get back, get back.
- Oh, oh.

10:20.704 --> 10:22.622
Get back, get back.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.043
Whew,
I guess it's a whole cycle.

10:28.586 --> 10:30.338
So you think
you can just talk the hackers

10:30.338 --> 10:31.589
out of releasing your emails?

10:31.589 --> 10:33.842
Well, I would prefer
to pay them,

10:33.842 --> 10:36.261
but I guess I'll just have
to charm them instead.

10:36.261 --> 10:38.013
Trust me,
I can schmooze anyone.

10:38.013 --> 10:40.890
- OK, we're on.
- Oh. Hey, there! Hi!

10:40.890 --> 10:43.101
Katherine Hastings,
CEO Payne Motors.

10:43.101 --> 10:45.854
- And who do we have here?
<i>- No names.</i>

10:45.854 --> 10:47.605
[laughs] Anonymous.
Very cool.

10:47.605 --> 10:50.483
I like it, yeah.
May I call you hacker?

10:50.483 --> 10:52.152
Is that--
Is hacker an offensive term?

10:52.152 --> 10:53.903
It's probably
a badge of honor.

10:53.903 --> 10:54.946
And how would you know that?

10:54.946 --> 10:56.197
<i>It's fine.</i>

10:56.197 --> 10:57.615
- See?
<i>- We have our demands.</i>

10:57.615 --> 10:59.826
<i>Deliver the Bitcoin,
or we leak the data.</i>

10:59.826 --> 11:02.454
Yes, well,
I want to pay you,

11:02.454 --> 11:05.123
but we have encountered
a slight hiccup

11:05.123 --> 11:06.541
on the legal side.

11:06.541 --> 11:08.293
I don't know
what it's like in your office,

11:08.293 --> 11:10.211
but maybe you have
one of those guys

11:10.211 --> 11:12.881
who's like a real by the books
kind of stick in the mud.

11:12.881 --> 11:14.132
You know,
really not a team player,

11:14.132 --> 11:16.968
- kinda grates on everyone.
<i>- Ivan.</i>

11:16.968 --> 11:18.094
Yes.
[laughs]

11:18.094 --> 11:20.388
Ugh, exactly, exactly.

11:20.388 --> 11:22.140
I think we're both just gonna
have to work around

11:22.140 --> 11:23.975
our respective Ivans here.

11:23.975 --> 11:25.477
This is a waste of time,
all right?

11:25.477 --> 11:28.063
These guys are criminals
or possibly terrorists.

11:28.063 --> 11:29.939
Come on, Elliot.

11:29.939 --> 11:32.067
I mean, you guys
aren't terrorists, right?

11:32.067 --> 11:33.985
<i>We're freedom fighters.</i>

11:33.985 --> 11:35.653
I'm not sure
what to do with that one.

11:35.653 --> 11:37.489
<i>You must pay Bitcoin
by end of day</i>

11:37.489 --> 11:40.158
<i>or we will send this
to everyone.</i>

11:40.158 --> 11:41.826
- [gasps]
- Oh, my God!

11:41.826 --> 11:43.953
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Everyone, look away!

11:43.953 --> 11:45.580
Why does this exist?

11:45.580 --> 11:47.499
Richard and I were sexting.
Nobody's supposed to see these.

11:47.499 --> 11:49.876
- Katherine.
- Is that Elliot in the back?

11:49.876 --> 11:51.503
I am mid-presentation.

11:51.503 --> 11:52.587
I knew you weren't
paying attention.

11:52.587 --> 11:55.006
All right.
Nobody look, nobody look!

11:55.006 --> 11:56.216
It's looking right at me.

12:00.887 --> 12:01.721
This is
our therapist's fault.

12:02.722 --> 12:03.890
Richard and I
were falling apart,

12:03.890 --> 12:05.392
and her only advice is,
"keep it spicy."

12:05.392 --> 12:07.268
Your therapist
advised full spread?

12:07.268 --> 12:08.853
That is not professional.
You should sue.

12:08.853 --> 12:10.855
God, how could this
be happening to me?

12:10.855 --> 12:12.273
Well, we could probably
trace it back to when

12:12.273 --> 12:13.650
you took your undies off
at work.

12:13.650 --> 12:15.527
- [sighs]
- Hey, did you connect

12:15.527 --> 12:16.820
your phone
to your work account?

12:16.820 --> 12:18.154
Because then they
would have access

12:18.154 --> 12:19.656
to all of your text messages.

12:19.656 --> 12:21.574
Oh, my God. That can happen?

12:21.574 --> 12:23.201
[sighs] That means
they have all the photos.

12:23.201 --> 12:24.536
All the photos?

12:24.536 --> 12:26.329
You mean there's more
than what we saw?

12:26.329 --> 12:27.831
That was one
of the classier ones.

12:27.831 --> 12:30.333
I'm stressed.
Let me hit it.

12:31.251 --> 12:33.586
I gotta go call Richard.

12:33.586 --> 12:37.257
Waffles69.
Waffles exclamation point.

12:37.257 --> 12:38.883
OK.

12:38.883 --> 12:40.552
You are not gonna believe
what you just missed.

12:40.552 --> 12:42.595
Katherine sent
a nude to her husband

12:42.595 --> 12:44.305
and the hackers got hold of it.

12:44.305 --> 12:45.974
- Oh, cool.
- No, no, no.

12:45.974 --> 12:49.269
They sent it to us.
You can see everything.

12:49.269 --> 12:50.895
- [sighs] Oh, my--
- I feel like

12:50.895 --> 12:52.522
you should be
a lot more excited about this.

12:52.522 --> 12:54.107
I'm trying to remember
all the passwords

12:54.107 --> 12:55.692
I've ever used for any account.

12:55.692 --> 12:57.402
Maybe I use one of them
for the Bitcoin.

12:57.402 --> 12:59.779
What's "don't go
Jason Waterfalls"?

12:59.779 --> 13:02.198
- Uh, the TLC song?
- That's not the line.

13:02.198 --> 13:03.867
I thought it was the line
when I made the password,

13:03.867 --> 13:05.410
or maybe I didn't.

13:05.410 --> 13:07.454
I don't know, man.
I'm freaking out.

13:07.454 --> 13:09.247
I probably could get you
a copy of the photo.

13:09.247 --> 13:11.082
That'd be fun, right?

13:11.082 --> 13:14.878
Naked pictures of women.
Wes, now I'm getting concerned.

13:14.878 --> 13:17.464
[fan whooshing]

13:21.176 --> 13:23.261
- Can you actually--
- Yep, that's annoying.

13:23.261 --> 13:25.096
- Sorry.
- Mm-hmm.

13:25.096 --> 13:26.431
<i>Are you sure
they have all the pictures?</i>

13:26.431 --> 13:27.766
- Yes.
<i>- No!</i>

13:27.766 --> 13:29.059
- Yes.
<i>- What about the kitchen one?</i>

13:29.059 --> 13:30.769
All of them, Richard!

13:30.769 --> 13:31.978
<i>I would never
use condiments that way.</i>

13:31.978 --> 13:33.855
I'll fix it.
I always fix everything.

13:33.855 --> 13:35.940
- You see what you did?
- I am not enjoying this, OK?

13:35.940 --> 13:37.442
I hate it, all right?

13:37.442 --> 13:38.943
I can feel
my hives coming back.

13:38.943 --> 13:40.236
I don't get it.

13:40.236 --> 13:42.197
You're usually such
a spineless, weak yes-man.

13:42.197 --> 13:43.740
Yeah, I know, OK?

13:43.740 --> 13:45.617
And that's why
every fiber of my being

13:45.617 --> 13:47.619
is screaming at me
to authorize the payments.

13:47.619 --> 13:50.121
I am desperate
to obey her, but I can't.

13:50.121 --> 13:51.498
Well, just do it.

13:51.498 --> 13:52.957
Pretend she's
the queen or something.

13:52.957 --> 13:55.835
She's not the only victim
in this, all right? OK?

13:55.835 --> 13:58.046
Yes, her genitals
are out in the public sphere,

13:58.046 --> 14:00.215
but so is my face
right next to her genitals.

14:00.215 --> 14:01.800
What are people going to think?

14:01.800 --> 14:03.343
They're gonna be thinking
about her genitals.

14:03.343 --> 14:06.680
[both tapping rhythmically]

14:08.390 --> 14:10.684
- Take it home!
- I see you.

14:10.684 --> 14:11.976
[laughs]

14:11.976 --> 14:13.061
That was quite good.

14:13.061 --> 14:14.354
I think so.

14:14.354 --> 14:16.272
That was the coolest
I've ever felt.

14:16.272 --> 14:18.024
Oh, yeah.

14:18.024 --> 14:19.651
Hey, it's snowing.

14:19.651 --> 14:22.570
That is actually
really pretty.

14:22.570 --> 14:25.365
Oh, it's kinda--it's coming
down pretty hard, though.

14:25.365 --> 14:28.660
- Yeah.
- It's really cold.

14:28.660 --> 14:31.830
- Fast, too.
- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

14:31.830 --> 14:33.373
Hypnosis is just
about getting you

14:33.373 --> 14:36.668
into a meditative state so
that you can access memories.

14:36.668 --> 14:38.086
Now close your eyes
and take in

14:38.086 --> 14:40.005
a nice, deep breath.

14:40.005 --> 14:41.339
Shouldn't you have,
like, a pocket watch

14:41.339 --> 14:43.008
or, like, a big spiral thing
that keeps turning?

14:43.008 --> 14:44.217
I'm sorry.

14:44.217 --> 14:45.510
I didn't realize
you wanted to be hypnotized

14:45.510 --> 14:46.845
"Looney Tunes" style.

14:46.845 --> 14:49.097
I'm telling you this will work.

14:49.097 --> 14:51.099
In therapy, it helped me
through a lot of stuff.

14:51.099 --> 14:53.601
OK, maybe my mind's not
as weak as yours, though.

14:53.601 --> 14:56.521
- Excuse me?
- I'm not suggestible.

14:56.521 --> 14:57.897
God, I'm not one
of those idiots

14:57.897 --> 15:00.608
who can be hypnotized
into clucking like a chicken

15:00.608 --> 15:02.944
- or whatever.
- Mm-hmm, right.

15:02.944 --> 15:05.613
Well, even if I was trying
to get you to make

15:05.613 --> 15:07.490
chicken noises,
they're super hard to make,

15:07.490 --> 15:08.950
so I doubt you could
do it anyway.

15:08.950 --> 15:11.036
Not that hard dude. Cluck.

15:11.036 --> 15:12.454
No, I mean
like a real chicken

15:12.454 --> 15:14.080
because chickens don't cluck.
They "bock."

15:14.080 --> 15:15.749
OK, fine.
"Bock."

15:15.749 --> 15:17.876
No, but they're, like,
much louder and higher pitch.

15:17.876 --> 15:20.170
- "Bock."
- Yeah, but more repetitive.

15:20.170 --> 15:21.379
[imitating chicken]

15:21.379 --> 15:22.630
Oh,
and you don't think anybody

15:22.630 --> 15:23.840
- could ever get you to do that?
- No. I don't.

15:23.840 --> 15:29.220
- OK. Show me again.
- [imitating chicken]

15:29.220 --> 15:30.347
Knock knock.

15:30.347 --> 15:33.016
Oh, Katherine.
Hi, come in.

15:33.016 --> 15:35.143
This is your office, huh?
This is the whole--

15:35.143 --> 15:36.728
well, it's nice.

15:36.728 --> 15:38.897
- You've done a nice job with it.
- Thanks.

15:38.897 --> 15:41.441
Look, Katherine,
I can't do what it is you--

15:41.441 --> 15:43.109
I consider you a friend,
I do.

15:43.109 --> 15:45.236
I mean, I know we have fun
with your accent,

15:45.236 --> 15:47.197
and all that, you know.

15:47.197 --> 15:48.698
Like, what do you call this?

15:48.698 --> 15:51.618
- Oh, that's a soda.
- No, no.

15:51.618 --> 15:53.828
- The material, the can.
- Oh.

15:53.828 --> 15:55.330
- The aluminum.
- Oh yeah.

15:55.330 --> 15:56.539
- Say aluminum.
- Aluminum.

15:56.539 --> 15:58.458
No, not how I would say it.

15:58.458 --> 16:00.293
Say--
um, it's fine.

16:00.293 --> 16:03.546
Look, I'm not going
to ask you to do something

16:03.546 --> 16:04.839
you're not comfortable with.

16:04.839 --> 16:07.217
In the end, I respect
whatever you decide.

16:07.217 --> 16:08.677
I am just--

16:08.677 --> 16:10.929
I am just asking you
as a friend

16:10.929 --> 16:13.431
to please consider
doing this for me.

16:13.431 --> 16:14.683
Thank you,
and I appreciate that.

16:14.683 --> 16:16.142
And listen,
I would love to help--

16:16.142 --> 16:18.603
Holy [bleep]!
You are worthless.

16:18.603 --> 16:20.563
You are a worthless grub
of a man.

16:20.563 --> 16:21.940
Whoa.

16:21.940 --> 16:23.274
Whew. Ugh.

16:23.274 --> 16:25.902
That cold air just pours
right in, doesn't it?

16:25.902 --> 16:27.654
- It's just so poorly made.
- Mm-hmm.

16:27.654 --> 16:29.072
I thought that,
like, doing this thing

16:29.072 --> 16:30.782
was gonna make you warmer,
it's making me colder.

16:30.782 --> 16:32.158
You know,
on "Naked and Afraid,"

16:32.158 --> 16:33.827
they always kinda, like,
hug each other

16:33.827 --> 16:35.203
- for body heat.
- Right.

16:35.203 --> 16:37.580
I wasn't suggesting
that we, like--

16:37.580 --> 16:39.666
Ooh, yeah,
I am down for, like,

16:39.666 --> 16:41.418
- a safety cuddle, if you are.
- You're down?

16:41.418 --> 16:42.794
- Yeah, yeah.
- OK, sweet.

16:42.794 --> 16:43.753
- Bring it in.
- Yeah.

16:43.753 --> 16:44.921
- Whoa.
- Mm-hmm.

16:44.921 --> 16:46.297
[both chuckling]

16:46.297 --> 16:49.300
Yeah. That is nice.

16:49.300 --> 16:51.219
Oh.

16:51.219 --> 16:52.679
I am begging you, Elliot.

16:52.679 --> 16:54.973
This will ruin my life,
not just my job.

16:54.973 --> 16:56.391
You think Richard is gonna
to stay with me

16:56.391 --> 16:59.102
if I am the reason
that a picture of his penis

16:59.102 --> 17:01.146
with a squiggle of mustard
gets out on the internet?

17:01.146 --> 17:02.939
Why would you take
that picture?

17:02.939 --> 17:04.399
We thought it would be sexy.

17:04.399 --> 17:05.817
I mean, it was stupid.
It wasn't.

17:05.817 --> 17:08.236
It was humiliating, OK?
It wasn't fun.

17:08.236 --> 17:09.821
It wasn't--did you know
that mustard stains?

17:09.821 --> 17:10.989
- Surely not forever.
- Did you know that

17:10.989 --> 17:12.574
it stains the skin?
I didn't know that.

17:12.574 --> 17:14.242
I swear to God
I didn't know that.

17:14.242 --> 17:15.827
Katherine, I'm so sorry,
but you aren't the only one

17:15.827 --> 17:17.412
that's suffering here, right?

17:17.412 --> 17:19.497
I am at war internally between
my abject fealty to you, and--

17:19.497 --> 17:20.665
You do this.
This is your fault.

17:20.665 --> 17:22.000
- Oh, no, don't!
- Look at that.

17:22.000 --> 17:23.877
- You look at that right now!
- Ow! Please, stop!

17:23.877 --> 17:25.628
That is me
as a guidance counselor.

17:25.628 --> 17:27.380
Hey, where do you wanna
go to college?

17:32.385 --> 17:32.802
[both moaning]

17:36.348 --> 17:38.183
- Oh, this small in here.
- OK, yeah.

17:38.183 --> 17:39.309
- Over your head?
- Is this--no--

17:39.309 --> 17:40.977
- [honks horn]
- Oh. Is that the horn?

17:40.977 --> 17:42.187
- I think so.
- Oh, my God,

17:42.187 --> 17:43.104
this car is
such a piece of crap.

17:43.104 --> 17:44.689
Such a piece of crap.

17:44.689 --> 17:46.024
- Come on over.
- Yeah.

17:46.024 --> 17:47.025
- [thud]
- Ow. I hit my head.

17:47.025 --> 17:48.360
- That didn't work.
- OK, OK.

17:48.360 --> 17:49.944
- Can you come here?
- OK, how am I supposed to--

17:49.944 --> 17:52.030
- Just come here.
- All right, all right.

17:52.030 --> 17:54.616
<i>[upbeat soul music]</i>

17:54.616 --> 17:55.992
- OK.
- I am gonna come over.

17:55.992 --> 17:57.827
- Yeah, yeah. This is--
- Ooh, I think the lever

17:57.827 --> 17:59.704
is quite--I think the lever
is gonna, yep,

17:59.704 --> 18:00.705
drop like this!

18:00.705 --> 18:02.290
Oh, my God.

18:02.290 --> 18:04.292
[both laugh]

18:06.836 --> 18:09.214
Katherine.
This is Calvin.

18:09.214 --> 18:10.423
You've been beating me up
all day,

18:10.423 --> 18:11.675
so I thought it might
be useful for you

18:11.675 --> 18:13.134
to see this sort
of low level drone

18:13.134 --> 18:14.969
you'd be relying on for
assistance if I weren't here.

18:14.969 --> 18:16.888
But you said Katherine
wanted to congratulate me

18:16.888 --> 18:18.431
- on the Crystali brief?
- Yes.

18:18.431 --> 18:19.891
And I apologize
for bringing you here

18:19.891 --> 18:21.393
under false pretenses
just to humiliate you.

18:21.393 --> 18:24.020
Look, this sort of
credulousness is exactly

18:24.020 --> 18:25.230
the sort of character defect

18:25.230 --> 18:26.439
that I'm trying
to make you aware of.

18:26.439 --> 18:28.233
I mean, Calvin here
is mindless--no offense.

18:28.233 --> 18:29.734
These underlings,
they don't have

18:29.734 --> 18:30.944
the character,
the integrity,

18:30.944 --> 18:32.612
or the experience
that I bring to the table.

18:32.612 --> 18:34.197
What are you getting at?

18:34.197 --> 18:35.990
Well, my voice has value,

18:35.990 --> 18:37.742
and I'm drawing a line
in the sand.

18:37.742 --> 18:39.244
So if you won't accept
my counsel,

18:39.244 --> 18:40.954
I hope you'll accept
my letter of resignation.

18:40.954 --> 18:42.080
- I hope you recognize--
- Oh, great, I accept.

18:42.080 --> 18:43.456
You accept?
What do you mean?

18:43.456 --> 18:44.874
Wait, what is this?

18:44.874 --> 18:46.793
It's just a random piece
of paper out of my binder.

18:46.793 --> 18:48.003
Where's the letter?

18:48.003 --> 18:49.295
Well, there isn't
a letter is there?

18:49.295 --> 18:50.839
It's just supposed
to be a bluff

18:50.839 --> 18:52.549
to make you do what I want,
which is, like, be nice to me.

18:52.549 --> 18:53.883
Calvin, are you willing
to rubber stamp

18:53.883 --> 18:55.260
a ransom payment
to a bunch of hackers?

18:55.260 --> 18:57.554
- Are you telling me I have to?
- Yes.

18:57.554 --> 18:59.180
- OK.
- Well, hang on.

18:59.180 --> 19:00.849
It was just a fake resignation,
so let's not get carried away.

19:00.849 --> 19:02.350
OK. Fine.
You're fired.

19:02.350 --> 19:03.518
There. Poof.

19:03.518 --> 19:05.979
What?
No, don't poof--don't poof me.

19:05.979 --> 19:07.272
This is very serious. Stop.

19:07.272 --> 19:08.565
Calvin, on me.

19:08.565 --> 19:11.401
Let's all--let's all
just, you know, rewind.

19:11.401 --> 19:13.111
[grumbles indistinctly]

19:13.111 --> 19:15.155
What's up with this
little pork pie hat?

19:15.155 --> 19:17.407
It's a fedora.
It's sexy.

19:17.407 --> 19:19.743
He's a little stressed.
He's trying to jog his memory.

19:19.743 --> 19:20.952
You'd be stressed,
too, if you were

19:20.952 --> 19:23.455
- close to losing $70 million.
- $70 million?

19:23.455 --> 19:25.582
- You're that rich?
- I'm so stupid.

19:25.582 --> 19:27.459
Why don't I make it something
simple and obvious,

19:27.459 --> 19:29.502
like do not forget
this pass phrase.

19:29.502 --> 19:31.254
[gasps]
Oh, my God!

19:31.254 --> 19:33.882
Oh, that's it.
That's it.

19:33.882 --> 19:38.219
"Do not forget
this pass phrase."

19:38.219 --> 19:39.804
[buzzer blares]
[bleep]

19:39.804 --> 19:42.265
- You tried that one earlier.
- How many guesses is that?

19:42.265 --> 19:45.352
That's nine, so one left.

19:47.520 --> 19:50.231
You know what?

19:50.231 --> 19:52.650
Forget it.

19:52.650 --> 19:53.777
What are you doing?

19:53.777 --> 19:55.695
I'm choosing not to play.

19:55.695 --> 19:58.698
As long as I don't make
any more wrong guesses,

19:58.698 --> 19:59.991
I still have my money.

19:59.991 --> 20:01.493
But you can't access it?

20:01.493 --> 20:02.994
But I still have it.

20:02.994 --> 20:05.121
I have it right here.

20:05.121 --> 20:06.331
What's the point
of having money,

20:06.331 --> 20:07.582
Wesley, if you can't spend any?

20:07.582 --> 20:09.209
I said I have it right here.

20:09.209 --> 20:10.710
Looking like
an extra from "Goodfellas."

20:10.710 --> 20:13.338
- I told him to get rid of it.
- Don't he look stupid?

20:13.338 --> 20:16.132
So that was, uhh,
that was cool.

20:16.132 --> 20:18.551
Yeah, yeah, it was cool.

20:18.551 --> 20:21.137
It was--I was gonna say
it was cool.

20:21.137 --> 20:23.556
Is that always part
of the vehicle testing?

20:23.556 --> 20:25.350
Ooh, yeah. Yep.

20:25.350 --> 20:28.269
Rain, wind, snow, sex stuff.
That's pretty standard.

20:28.269 --> 20:30.897
- [both laugh]
- Hey.

20:32.941 --> 20:34.484
Hey.

20:34.484 --> 20:37.404
I have some photos
for you to look at.

20:37.404 --> 20:38.446
Oh.

20:38.446 --> 20:40.198
Of the car.

20:40.198 --> 20:42.867
How long has she been there?

20:42.867 --> 20:45.286
Jeez, chin up.

20:45.912 --> 20:47.914
[scoffs]

20:47.914 --> 20:49.708
You're obviously not fired.

20:49.708 --> 20:52.210
Oh.
What about Calvin?

20:52.210 --> 20:53.628
Calvin just put his name
on a payment

20:53.628 --> 20:55.714
to a bunch of terrorists.
The guy is radioactive.

20:55.714 --> 20:57.215
Oh.

20:57.215 --> 21:00.051
Look, if I'm being honest,
I'm shocked

21:00.051 --> 21:02.178
that you stood up to me,
I'm almost impressed.

21:02.178 --> 21:05.557
Oh, well, yeah, I mean,

21:05.557 --> 21:07.392
you know, on my day,
I can be pretty forceful.

21:07.392 --> 21:08.977
Yeah. Don't ever do it again.

21:08.977 --> 21:11.104
No, no, God, no.
I wouldn't dream of it.

21:11.104 --> 21:13.231
- Good.
- Lesson learned.

21:13.231 --> 21:14.566
Oh, hey, Katherine.

21:14.566 --> 21:17.110
What do we got here,
some aluminum?

21:17.110 --> 21:19.279
That's crazy.
I love that.

21:19.279 --> 21:22.741
Yeah.
Great. Great.

21:22.741 --> 21:25.952
Yes!
OK.

21:25.952 --> 21:26.995
You're back in the game,
E-bomb.

21:26.995 --> 21:28.496
[laughs]

21:28.496 --> 21:30.081
I think we'll be having
a stuffed crust tonight,

21:30.081 --> 21:31.958
yeah, and a fizzy drink.
