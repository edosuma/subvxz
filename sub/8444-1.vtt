00:10.000 --> 00:22.000
You're Watching on 123Movies.to

00:41.250 --> 00:45.120
Long, long ago,
in a faraway land

00:45.290 --> 00:48.890
a young woodcarver took
secretly to the forest.

00:49.060 --> 00:54.050
His name was Geppetto,
and he was shy and quiet.

00:54.230 --> 00:56.600
Oh, and very much in love.

00:56.770 --> 00:59.600
I carve this heart
for dear Leona...

00:59.840 --> 01:02.070
while in this
peaceful meadow.

01:02.240 --> 01:04.640
With dreams and hope...

01:04.810 --> 01:07.110
my love endures.

01:07.280 --> 01:10.510
Forever yours, Geppetto.

01:11.750 --> 01:15.080
Sooner or later, though,
when the heart is full...

01:15.250 --> 01:17.590
and the heavens are listening,

01:17.760 --> 01:21.190
magic... is bound to happen.

01:45.020 --> 01:49.720
For many years after,
Geppetto kept to his chores,

01:49.890 --> 01:52.760
and the forest
kept Geppetto's secret.

01:52.920 --> 01:56.880
But the forest knew one thing
that Geppetto did not:

01:57.060 --> 02:00.230
that miracles
don't grow on trees.

02:00.400 --> 02:03.560
Miracles are made
in the heart

02:21.150 --> 02:24.710
A log underneath the wheel.

02:24.890 --> 02:27.450
Oh, I got to take you home.

02:27.630 --> 02:30.030
A very good one, too.

02:30.200 --> 02:31.420
All right.

02:32.530 --> 02:33.900
Here we go.

02:40.110 --> 02:43.970
@ My wife's the blushing,
blooming rose of dawning

02:44.140 --> 02:45.470
@ Without the sting

02:45.640 --> 02:47.130
Morning, Luigi

02:47.310 --> 02:49.080
Put a sock in it, Luigi!

02:49.250 --> 02:51.080
@ Welcome, welcome

02:51.250 --> 02:52.840
@ Blessed morning sun

02:53.020 --> 02:54.250
@ Welcome, welcome

02:54.420 --> 02:55.410
@ New day just begun

02:55.590 --> 02:56.650
@ Buon giorno, life

02:56.820 --> 02:58.120
@ Buon giorno, sun

02:58.290 --> 02:59.620
@ Buon giorno, wife

02:59.790 --> 03:01.190
@ My Little one

03:01.360 --> 03:02.660
@ That's my little song

03:02.830 --> 03:05.020
@ Good day,
buon giorno, everyone

03:05.200 --> 03:06.690
@ Housework, homework

03:06.870 --> 03:08.530
@ Off to work we go

03:08.700 --> 03:10.360
@ Buying, selling

03:10.540 --> 03:12.400
@ Making money so that we can eat

03:12.570 --> 03:13.540
@ And we can drink

03:13.710 --> 03:16.770
@ and we can have a little fun

03:16.940 --> 03:18.070
@ I've sung my little song

03:18.240 --> 03:20.110
@ And now my little song is done

03:23.680 --> 03:25.480
@ Buon giorno, Life,
buon giorno, sun

03:25.650 --> 03:28.410
@ Buon giorno, wife,
my little one

03:28.590 --> 03:30.080
@ That's my little song

03:30.260 --> 03:33.250
@ Good day,
buon giorno, everyone

03:34.990 --> 03:36.120
Watch this

03:39.400 --> 03:41.190
Oops, looks like you've
dropped your wood,

03:41.370 --> 03:42.230
Signor Puppetmaker.

03:42.400 --> 03:44.390
Maybe I should be
more careful next time

03:46.100 --> 03:47.090
Let's go boys.

03:47.270 --> 03:49.500
Hey, last one to the bridge
gets dunked.

03:56.880 --> 03:58.870
Yoo hoo, everybody.

03:59.050 --> 04:00.680
I'm home.

04:02.850 --> 04:04.750
All right, don't say hello.

04:07.090 --> 04:08.420
Hello, little one.

04:08.590 --> 04:09.920
How was your day?

04:10.100 --> 04:11.890
Ah, that's nice. Me...

04:12.060 --> 04:14.360
I got lost in the forest.

04:14.530 --> 04:18.730
Used to be a time
when west was west.

04:18.899 --> 04:20.560
Are you two fighting again?

04:20.740 --> 04:23.400
What's the problem this time?

04:23.580 --> 04:26.200
He said I have a funny nose.

04:26.380 --> 04:28.440
I said you have a funny toes.

04:28.610 --> 04:29.710
Funny nose.

04:29.880 --> 04:31.040
Funny toes.

04:31.220 --> 04:33.840
Now stop it. I'm tired of
hearing you two argue.

04:34.020 --> 04:35.490
Stop it!

04:36.760 --> 04:39.780
You know what happens
to bad little boys who fight?

04:39.960 --> 04:43.050
They go to bed
without being sandpapered.

04:45.860 --> 04:47.350
It's chilly.

04:54.740 --> 04:55.870
There.

04:56.040 --> 04:58.670
It's going to be a chilly night.

05:11.990 --> 05:15.190
This log has a will of it's own.

05:23.430 --> 05:26.930
Let's see if we can find
a face to match.

05:43.220 --> 05:45.420
Our heart.

05:45.590 --> 05:49.080
Anyone who wants a new brother,
say so now.

05:49.260 --> 05:53.160
All right, all right,
don't everybody talk at once.

05:55.870 --> 05:58.930
I'm going to make
the most perfect nose.

06:02.510 --> 06:06.500
A world of wisdom
could be told in a nose.

06:55.330 --> 06:58.450
Open wide.
Give me a big smile.

07:17.220 --> 07:20.670
Nina, go find yourself a mouse.

07:43.810 --> 07:47.210
Blue eyes, just like your papa.

07:53.350 --> 07:55.950
Bellissimo.

07:58.090 --> 08:01.750
Now would you like your papa
to show you how to walk?

08:02.530 --> 08:03.550
Yes?

08:05.200 --> 08:08.460
Very nice.
What a smart little boy you are.

08:08.630 --> 08:10.730
Excuse me, coming through!

08:10.900 --> 08:13.030
Now say hello
to your brothers and sisters.

08:13.200 --> 08:14.470
Say hello.

08:14.640 --> 08:17.670
They'll keep you company
while I'm at work.

08:17.840 --> 08:21.370
Now what shall we call you,
dear child, hmm?

08:21.550 --> 08:23.570
You're made of pine.

08:23.750 --> 08:25.580
That's a start.

08:28.250 --> 08:30.190
You have beautiful eyes.

08:30.360 --> 08:33.289
Occhi magnifico.

08:35.360 --> 08:37.520
We'll call you...

08:39.200 --> 08:40.960
Pinocchio!

08:42.570 --> 08:44.000
Pinocchio.

08:49.770 --> 08:52.070
Better to have puppets...

08:52.240 --> 08:57.040
than noisy little boys
running around.

09:01.620 --> 09:04.110
Oh, my back is...

09:11.260 --> 09:14.320
I'm not as young
as I used to be.

10:15.530 --> 10:17.320
Nina, leave that puppet alone!

10:17.500 --> 10:19.690
Behave yourself!

10:41.990 --> 10:45.650
Excuse me,
coming through.

11:09.810 --> 11:11.440
Ah, get the soap.

11:22.930 --> 11:24.860
Thank you.
Now get me the scrub brush.

11:25.030 --> 11:26.660
Scwub-bwsh.

11:39.340 --> 11:41.470
It's happened.

11:41.650 --> 11:44.140
I've finally lost my mind.

11:44.320 --> 11:45.780
Mind...

11:47.850 --> 11:49.440
It's impossible!

11:51.490 --> 11:52.890
You can't be real!

11:53.060 --> 11:54.750
Real.

11:54.930 --> 11:56.590
But you're a puppet!

11:58.630 --> 12:00.320
Pup-peh...

12:01.800 --> 12:02.860
Pa-pa!

12:03.030 --> 12:06.060
No, I'm not your papa!

12:10.140 --> 12:11.340
Wait, Pinocchio.

12:12.340 --> 12:12.670
Stop!

12:16.480 --> 12:19.310
Come down right now!

12:19.480 --> 12:20.970
What are you doing?

12:22.920 --> 12:25.320
Come down this instant,
young... man.

12:25.490 --> 12:26.850
Come down here!

12:27.020 --> 12:28.720
I'm not going to go
chasing after you.

13:34.330 --> 13:36.560
Luigi, please, put a sock in it!

13:43.070 --> 13:44.830
Pinocchio, hold on, I'll save you!

14:11.000 --> 14:12.090
No!

14:27.610 --> 14:30.640
Take off my underwear right now!

14:33.680 --> 14:36.020
Pinocchio, listen to me.

14:36.390 --> 14:37.450
Pinocchio?

14:37.490 --> 14:38.960
Right. Listen to me.

14:39.120 --> 14:40.520
Papa.

14:40.690 --> 14:42.220
No, l--No, that's not--

14:42.390 --> 14:44.220
Well, yes,
in a manner of speaking.

14:44.400 --> 14:46.120
No, I'm not your papa.

14:46.160 --> 14:47.930
Papa, papa, papa...

14:47.970 --> 14:50.020
You are a puppet.
You're not a real boy.

14:50.200 --> 14:51.430
Real boy.

14:51.600 --> 14:53.500
No! And be glad for it.

14:53.670 --> 14:55.730
If you were a real boy,

14:55.910 --> 14:58.970
you'd have to have doctor
instead of--

14:59.140 --> 15:01.370
Sit still!

15:01.550 --> 15:04.980
Look at this mess! I'll have
to wash all over again.

15:05.150 --> 15:06.670
Ciao, Geppetto.

15:06.850 --> 15:08.940
Quite a new puppet.

15:09.120 --> 15:10.610
He's amazing.

15:10.790 --> 15:11.950
He still needs work.

15:12.120 --> 15:14.850
So do you. Look at you,
you were up all night again.

15:15.030 --> 15:18.360
- I slept a little.
- You were up all night.

15:18.530 --> 15:22.060
I made these
for Lorenzini's puppets,

15:22.230 --> 15:24.430
but I think he needs them more.

15:24.600 --> 15:25.430
Thank you.

15:25.600 --> 15:27.130
You're welcome.

15:27.300 --> 15:29.600
Wouldn't want
his head to fry, either.

15:29.770 --> 15:30.600
Thank you.

15:30.780 --> 15:32.000
You're welcome.

15:32.180 --> 15:34.080
Bet your house
is full of sawdust.

15:34.250 --> 15:35.340
I'll come by and sweep it up.

15:35.510 --> 15:36.980
Leona, I'm not a child.

15:37.150 --> 15:39.010
The Little one,
does he have a name?

15:39.180 --> 15:40.550
Pinocchio.

15:40.720 --> 15:43.020
Enchanted.

15:43.190 --> 15:44.550
Leona

15:44.660 --> 15:46.150
Leona...

15:52.430 --> 15:54.900
You even gave him your heart.

15:55.070 --> 15:56.430
Our heart

15:56.600 --> 15:58.230
What did you say?

15:58.400 --> 16:00.800
Nothing.

16:00.970 --> 16:02.530
Come, Pinocchio.

16:02.710 --> 16:05.170
Come, Pinocchio.
Come, Papa.

16:09.780 --> 16:11.770
Seems a little stiff, Leona.

16:11.950 --> 16:14.110
Just like his father.

16:20.620 --> 16:23.020
Marco, look!

16:23.190 --> 16:24.290
Look here.

16:24.460 --> 16:26.660
Wow! Look at that.

16:38.240 --> 16:39.570
Wow!

17:00.260 --> 17:01.730
Stop it!

17:21.390 --> 17:23.079
What are you doing?

17:23.250 --> 17:24.220
It's your color.

17:24.390 --> 17:27.319
- Did I ask for a scarf?
- No.

17:27.490 --> 17:29.120
Then get rid of it.

17:29.290 --> 17:30.820
I'll take that one.

17:33.800 --> 17:36.320
He's magnificent, Geppetto!

17:36.500 --> 17:38.800
Do you see what I see?

17:38.840 --> 17:39.860
Yes!

17:40.870 --> 17:43.470
What?

17:43.640 --> 17:45.800
He is more than--
he's just--

17:45.980 --> 17:47.140
he's...

17:47.310 --> 17:48.470
Well, l--well...

17:48.650 --> 17:49.910
How did you do this?

17:50.080 --> 17:51.010
I don't know.

17:51.180 --> 17:52.150
Where are the strings? l--

17:52.320 --> 17:53.150
I don't know.

17:53.320 --> 17:54.250
You don't know.

17:54.420 --> 17:57.820
I don't know.
Tino, am I going crazy?

17:57.990 --> 18:00.510
I have no idea
how this happened.

18:00.690 --> 18:02.560
They're going to
burn me at the stake!

18:02.730 --> 18:05.990
No, no,
they've stopped burning people.

18:06.160 --> 18:08.150
They might hang you, though.

18:11.140 --> 18:12.600
Excuse me, coming through.

18:12.770 --> 18:14.260
Then you'll know where
the strings are.

18:27.650 --> 18:30.620
Are you real boy?

18:30.790 --> 18:33.220
Yes. Are you?

18:33.960 --> 18:34.980
Yes

19:03.120 --> 19:05.210
Hello

19:05.260 --> 19:06.690
Hello

19:07.860 --> 19:11.760
Oh, my, what an intriguing
little item you are.

19:11.930 --> 19:13.120
May l?

19:16.400 --> 19:18.830
Empty as a witch's dowry.

19:19.000 --> 19:24.130
Oh, and look how smoothly
his arms move.

19:24.310 --> 19:26.070
Volpe, Felinet...

19:28.250 --> 19:32.110
Excuse me, but haven't you two
got a pushcart to rob?

19:32.280 --> 19:34.150
We've already done that.

19:35.750 --> 19:36.740
Come, Pinocchio.

19:36.920 --> 19:40.860
Oh, but, Geppetto, darling,
we were just playing with him.

19:41.030 --> 19:42.220
He'll play with
his own sort, thank you.

19:42.390 --> 19:44.830
And what sort would that be?

19:46.530 --> 19:50.090
Pinocchio, don't
wander away like that.

19:50.270 --> 19:52.130
I don't want you to do that.

19:52.300 --> 19:56.170
I don't get it.
ls he a boy or a puppet?

19:56.340 --> 19:59.970
He's a puppet, furface,
and he's worth a fortune.

20:00.140 --> 20:03.270
And I know exactly
where to cash him in.

20:03.450 --> 20:06.280
Don't worry, son,
I'll get your ball back.

20:09.850 --> 20:13.080
Take my kid's ball, would you?

20:38.580 --> 20:40.710
Listen closely.

20:40.880 --> 20:42.910
Next week's puppet show...

20:43.090 --> 20:45.420
must be the most
spectacular ever.

20:45.590 --> 20:48.850
Every single boy
must be in attendance.

20:49.030 --> 20:51.650
Lorenzini, darling.

20:51.830 --> 20:54.260
Felinet, looking for employment?

20:54.430 --> 20:57.630
I see my timing is purr-fect!

20:57.800 --> 20:59.830
What I've seen
will assure you...

21:00.000 --> 21:03.630
more curtain calls
than Rome has rats.

21:03.810 --> 21:05.830
Do tell.

21:06.010 --> 21:08.670
There, there. That's better.

21:08.850 --> 21:11.280
That's didn't hurt, did it?

21:11.450 --> 21:13.010
No. Didn't hurt.

21:19.160 --> 21:20.750
What does he want?

21:23.760 --> 21:25.230
Open up.

21:25.400 --> 21:26.990
No good can come of this.

21:27.160 --> 21:29.130
Be very quiet.
Stay here and be quiet

21:32.440 --> 21:34.870
Don't even breathe.

21:35.040 --> 21:36.400
Do you understand?

21:36.570 --> 21:37.470
Open up!

21:37.640 --> 21:40.970
Signor Lorenzini, uh...

21:42.050 --> 21:43.640
Geppetto, my friend.

21:43.810 --> 21:47.150
To want do I owe this honor?

21:47.320 --> 21:50.840
The honor is mine
to call a gain on the man...

21:51.020 --> 21:52.610
with the magical hands.

21:52.790 --> 21:54.380
I bring good news, Geppetto.

21:54.560 --> 21:58.050
I am mounting my grandest
production ever,

21:58.230 --> 22:03.500
and I want to purchase
your newest creation...

22:05.070 --> 22:07.130
whatever that might be.

22:12.580 --> 22:15.980
I've been spending a great deal
of time in the forest lately.

22:16.150 --> 22:20.450
I will carve you something very
special the first chance I get.

22:22.150 --> 22:26.610
I was looking
for something with,

22:26.790 --> 22:30.690
shall we say, thinner strings.

22:30.860 --> 22:32.350
Thinner strings?

22:32.530 --> 22:35.520
Why-- why didn't
you say so? Come.

22:35.700 --> 22:37.830
I've got just the thing.

22:38.000 --> 22:41.160
These wonderful pieces
are made of cherry wood,

22:41.340 --> 22:45.040
and they are on sale
this week only.

22:45.210 --> 22:47.700
Don't toy with me.

22:47.880 --> 22:51.210
I didn't buy those puppets
from you two years ago,

22:51.380 --> 22:54.680
and I'm not going to
buy them today,

22:54.850 --> 22:57.620
so show me your best...

22:57.790 --> 22:59.850
and show me now.

23:08.730 --> 23:10.890
Excuse me. Coming through.

23:12.270 --> 23:15.710
Incredible.

23:15.870 --> 23:17.770
He is perfect.

23:20.080 --> 23:21.440
Stay.

23:21.610 --> 23:24.100
- Boys do little bugs.
- Bugs

23:24.150 --> 23:27.610
Don't they?
They like to tease them...

23:27.780 --> 23:29.580
and twist them and--

23:29.750 --> 23:30.980
Please, Lorenzini.

23:33.390 --> 23:36.950
Name your price.

23:37.130 --> 23:38.750
He's not for sale.

23:38.930 --> 23:42.390
- Geppetto, everything is for sale.
- Stay, Stay!

23:42.570 --> 23:45.030
Not him.
Not at any price.

23:45.200 --> 23:46.670
Stay, bug.

24:06.890 --> 24:10.990
You can have the emperor
and his daughter, and that's it.

24:14.560 --> 24:17.690
You are making a big mistake,
Geppetto.

24:20.670 --> 24:23.970
That's my last offer.
Take it or leave it.

24:27.310 --> 24:28.540
Very well.

24:33.150 --> 24:37.280
I will take these lovely puppets
off your hands.

24:37.450 --> 24:41.650
I'm just burning with ideas.

24:41.830 --> 24:45.350
Thank you.
Good afternoon, Geppetto.

24:51.700 --> 24:52.730
Pinocchio.

24:55.210 --> 24:56.300
Pinocchio

25:06.750 --> 25:08.480
Infantino is a creep.

25:12.190 --> 25:13.710
Hey, fatty!

25:24.630 --> 25:26.760
You're late, dimwit.

25:37.180 --> 25:40.120
Pinocchio, show
yourself right now...

25:40.280 --> 25:42.910
because I'm not leaving this
house to look for you again.

25:44.050 --> 25:46.320
Would someone please
like to tell us...

25:46.490 --> 25:49.820
of a characteristic
which separates humans...

25:49.990 --> 25:52.290
from the rest of
the animal kingdom?

25:52.460 --> 25:54.050
Cages.

25:54.230 --> 25:56.030
Humans cry tears, professore.

25:56.200 --> 25:58.860
Ah, tears.

26:00.370 --> 26:02.070
Expressions of the soul.

26:02.240 --> 26:05.770
Do any other creatures look
so deeply within themselves?

26:09.280 --> 26:11.940
No, professore. Only humans.

26:12.120 --> 26:14.740
We must always decide
what is right and wrong.

26:14.920 --> 26:15.910
Excellent.

26:26.260 --> 26:28.060
Hey, Woody.

26:28.230 --> 26:29.720
You ever get termites?

26:29.900 --> 26:32.490
What are termites?

26:32.670 --> 26:33.830
They're bugs.

26:34.000 --> 26:36.500
I like bugs.

26:36.670 --> 26:39.040
Not these kind, you don't.

26:39.210 --> 26:41.940
They eat wood like you.

26:46.920 --> 26:50.650
Hey, lay off my friend, Woody.

26:50.820 --> 26:52.950
Lay off my friend, Woody.

26:55.190 --> 26:57.290
What is going on
in my classroom?

27:00.700 --> 27:03.790
The new kid punched Lampwick,
professore.

27:13.910 --> 27:16.710
ls that true?

27:21.550 --> 27:22.610
No

27:27.860 --> 27:30.350
Hey, how'd you do that?

27:30.530 --> 27:32.150
Silence.

27:32.330 --> 27:36.820
Now, you're not lying to me
by any slim chance, are you?

27:49.210 --> 27:51.980
There are two kinds of lies--

27:52.150 --> 27:56.210
lies that have short legs
and lies that have a long nose,

27:56.390 --> 28:00.580
and yours are clearly the kind
that have long nose.

28:00.760 --> 28:05.290
Now, I will give you one
last chance to redeem yourself.

28:05.460 --> 28:10.300
If you didn't punch Lampwick,
how did he end up on the floor?

28:12.740 --> 28:16.100
Nobody punched Lampwick.

28:16.270 --> 28:19.330
Lampwick punched himself.

28:21.080 --> 28:25.140
l--l mean, a man climed
in the window and punched him.

28:25.320 --> 28:27.720
And Lampwick tried
to kick him back,

28:27.880 --> 28:30.110
but he missed and fell
on the floor, and--

28:38.760 --> 28:40.090
Silence.

28:41.600 --> 28:42.620
Infantino!

28:47.100 --> 28:48.230
Silence!

28:55.680 --> 28:59.780
Infantino, go on, go on.

28:59.950 --> 29:02.320
Handkerchief. Go on, quickly.

29:02.490 --> 29:05.820
Run, run, run, run, run!

29:28.280 --> 29:33.440
Right, I did punch Lampwick,
professore,

29:33.620 --> 29:36.590
and I'm sorry

29:36.750 --> 29:39.480
Well, it's too late
for that now.

29:39.660 --> 29:41.920
If there's one thing
l will not tolerate...

29:42.090 --> 29:44.460
in my classroom, it's a liar.

29:45.530 --> 29:46.890
Out.

29:53.240 --> 29:54.860
And...

29:55.040 --> 29:56.970
I'm sorry that
l kicked him, too.

29:57.140 --> 29:58.970
Out.

30:04.250 --> 30:08.380
And I'm even more sorry
that I told a lie.

30:08.550 --> 30:10.540
Out, out, I said.

30:10.720 --> 30:14.020
But I want to stay and learn.

30:14.190 --> 30:18.650
Now, class, we will review
what we have learned today.

30:30.470 --> 30:31.870
If anything happened to him,

30:32.040 --> 30:33.510
he's going to be
in big trouble.

30:33.680 --> 30:37.040
If I don't find him, I'm never
talking to him again.

30:37.210 --> 30:39.270
Pinocchio!

31:18.690 --> 31:22.420
It's finished.
Isn't it beautiful?

31:22.590 --> 31:24.390
Everything you bake
is beautiful, dear.

31:24.560 --> 31:27.460
You know, I sold it to
the magistrate by the pound,

31:27.630 --> 31:30.760
and the best part is,
l cheated on the weight.

31:30.930 --> 31:33.430
You're very good at that, dear.

31:38.240 --> 31:43.110
It reminds me of the cake
that we had on our wedding day.

31:58.430 --> 32:00.790
Don't eat that.

32:00.960 --> 32:02.230
- I'm not eating anything.
- Not you!

32:02.400 --> 32:04.300
Look!

32:07.800 --> 32:10.030
Mmm, more?

32:10.210 --> 32:11.500
I'll give you more.

32:11.670 --> 32:14.170
You're a bad boy, huh?

32:14.340 --> 32:16.740
Real bad boy.

32:21.750 --> 32:24.720
Little mischief maker.

32:47.410 --> 32:50.110
Your father's going to
pay for this!

33:00.290 --> 33:01.780
Got him.

33:05.260 --> 33:06.730
Even better.

33:23.210 --> 33:24.240
Pinocchio.

33:25.010 --> 33:27.380
Papa, want some?

33:27.550 --> 33:30.250
Geppetto, he's yours?

33:30.420 --> 33:32.080
Arrest him.

33:32.260 --> 33:33.720
Arrest both of them.

33:33.890 --> 33:34.880
You're under arrest, signore.

33:35.060 --> 33:36.220
Wait.

33:36.390 --> 33:37.590
Papa.

33:37.760 --> 33:39.590
Come on. you, too, little one.

33:41.500 --> 33:43.400
Hey, stop him!

33:43.570 --> 33:45.330
There goes our commission.

33:45.500 --> 33:46.990
Au contraire.

33:47.170 --> 33:49.760
I have a feeling our job
just got easier.

34:13.600 --> 34:15.000
Come on, now.

34:15.159 --> 34:17.130
It's past your bedtime.
Into bed.

34:17.300 --> 34:18.790
Good night, son.

34:20.800 --> 34:23.639
I love you, Papa.

34:27.409 --> 34:29.380
I love you, Papa.

35:34.640 --> 35:36.700
I can't do anything right.

35:36.880 --> 35:38.240
The human dilemma.

35:38.410 --> 35:39.970
Who said that?

35:40.150 --> 35:41.240
Or is it the puppet dilemma?

35:41.420 --> 35:43.610
You've still got cake
on your face.

35:46.520 --> 35:47.890
What?

35:49.590 --> 35:51.220
Say, do you always
squish someone...

35:51.390 --> 35:53.330
before being
formally introduced?

35:53.500 --> 35:56.950
Are--are you a termite?

35:57.130 --> 35:58.830
Oh, please!

35:59.000 --> 36:01.100
So you're not going to eat me.

36:01.270 --> 36:03.300
Thanks for the offer,
but I'm on a low-wood diet.

36:04.070 --> 36:06.100
Let me introduce myself.

36:06.280 --> 36:10.000
The name is...
Pugnacio Elecuzio P. Elegante.

36:10.000 --> 36:12.270
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to
The name is...
Pugnacio Elecuzio P. Elegante.

36:12.270 --> 36:13.580
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

36:13.580 --> 36:14.780
Give me a ''P,'' an ''E,''
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

36:14.780 --> 36:14.950
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

36:14.950 --> 36:16.380
a ''P,'' an ''E.''
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

36:16.380 --> 36:16.550
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

36:16.550 --> 36:20.150
Put 'em all together
and call me...
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

36:20.150 --> 36:20.320
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

36:20.320 --> 36:22.000
Pepe.
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

36:22.000 --> 36:22.420
Pepe.

36:23.760 --> 36:25.590
- Pepe?
- You don't like it?

36:25.760 --> 36:27.630
- It's OK.
- I'm very sensitive, you know.

36:27.800 --> 36:29.130
No. It's--it's fine.

36:29.300 --> 36:31.790
We can't all
be called Pinocchio.

36:31.970 --> 36:32.990
Now listen to me.

36:33.170 --> 36:36.760
I'm here because you are
one tumult little puppet.

36:36.940 --> 36:39.910
Your papa's in jail,
you're all alone,

36:40.080 --> 36:41.940
you trounced me
in the alley,

36:42.110 --> 36:45.980
and I'm here to see that we get
our friendship back on track...

36:46.150 --> 36:47.510
right this very second!

36:49.120 --> 36:51.280
Sorry.
Didn't meant to holler,

36:51.450 --> 36:52.850
but insects are people,
too, you know?

36:53.020 --> 36:57.290
And I'm a lot more than your
standard garden-variety cricket.

36:57.460 --> 36:58.950
I'm a teller of truths.

36:59.960 --> 37:02.760
I'll be your best friend,
pine cone.

37:02.930 --> 37:04.490
I'll open your eyes.

37:04.670 --> 37:07.160
I'm not a pine cone.
I'm a boy.

37:07.340 --> 37:09.700
Not yet, but it's
a top-notch goal...

37:09.870 --> 37:12.240
for such a cute little puppet,

37:12.410 --> 37:14.000
which is why it's time
to get to work.

37:14.180 --> 37:17.310
You can become a real boy
one you get the tools.

37:17.480 --> 37:20.570
I'll advise you
and be your regal guardian,

37:20.750 --> 37:22.310
but you've got to do
the hard work.

37:22.490 --> 37:23.820
You, my little sapling,

37:23.990 --> 37:25.820
will have to shed something blood,
sweat, and tree bark.

37:25.990 --> 37:28.050
Total eclipse.

37:30.030 --> 37:32.390
Visitors. How wonderful.

37:32.560 --> 37:35.530
Get the door, and be polite,
and smile, now.

37:35.700 --> 37:38.390
Show those pearly whites.

37:43.810 --> 37:45.640
No, stop.

37:45.810 --> 37:47.000
- Let me go.
- Come on. We've got you now.

37:59.820 --> 38:02.590
Court is now in session.

38:02.760 --> 38:07.130
Case number 491, your honor.

38:07.300 --> 38:14.000
The People versus Luca Antonio
Renaldo Geppetto Baldini.

38:14.170 --> 38:16.930
My papa.

38:17.110 --> 38:18.840
It will be all right, Pinocchio.

38:19.010 --> 38:22.210
There he is, your honor,
the little mutilator.

38:22.380 --> 38:23.940
He ruined my cannolis.

38:24.110 --> 38:25.440
He ruined my fruit tarts.

38:25.620 --> 38:26.640
Silence, woman.

38:26.820 --> 38:29.340
He even ruined my grandmother's
torta della nonna...

38:29.520 --> 38:31.780
with the pinoli
and the chocolate--

38:31.950 --> 38:32.780
Are you done?

38:32.960 --> 38:35.220
No, I am not done. I would--

38:35.390 --> 38:36.980
Arrest her!

38:37.160 --> 38:38.750
Now I'm done.

38:42.970 --> 38:44.560
Now...

38:44.730 --> 38:46.600
Since you, Geppetto,

38:46.770 --> 38:51.230
are responsible
for this, uh, puppet,

38:51.410 --> 38:53.340
how do you plead?

38:53.510 --> 38:55.370
Guilty, sir.

38:57.650 --> 39:02.410
You will pay 20,000 lira
to the bakers...

39:02.590 --> 39:04.490
and 10,000 to the court.

39:04.650 --> 39:05.590
l--l don't have it.

39:05.760 --> 39:07.520
That--that's
three years' wages.

39:07.690 --> 39:11.520
If you cannot pay, then you
will go to debtors prison.

39:11.690 --> 39:14.160
Three years locked away.

39:16.170 --> 39:17.360
Your honor.

39:19.800 --> 39:24.640
I propose the court
allow me to pay the fines...

39:24.810 --> 39:28.140
for this poor,
impoverished peasant.

39:28.310 --> 39:31.440
This is most generous
of you, Signore Lorenzini.

39:31.610 --> 39:33.510
Kindness is my weakness.

39:33.680 --> 39:37.950
Of course, no good deed
should go without obligation,

39:38.120 --> 39:42.580
so all I ask is to keep
Pinocchio in return.

39:42.760 --> 39:45.850
Lorenzini, please,
take any other puppet.

39:46.030 --> 39:49.620
I will work for you day
and night the rest of my life.

39:49.800 --> 39:56.670
Geppetto, is it just
money for you?

39:56.840 --> 39:58.570
Pinocchio needs a home.

39:58.740 --> 40:01.610
All you can offer him...

40:01.780 --> 40:05.580
is table scarps
and cold winter nights,

40:05.750 --> 40:08.650
but with me,
he will have a family.

40:08.820 --> 40:11.910
What's a family, Papa?

40:12.090 --> 40:16.180
My goodness,
such a heartbreaking question,

40:16.360 --> 40:19.490
one no one should
ever have to ask.

40:19.660 --> 40:23.360
Pinocchio, I can
give you a life...

40:23.530 --> 40:27.090
other little boys
only dream of.

40:27.270 --> 40:30.430
What is your decision, Geppetto?

40:48.760 --> 40:50.120
Listen to me.

40:50.290 --> 40:55.360
You're going to go
with that man now.

40:55.530 --> 40:58.690
But I want to be with you.

40:58.870 --> 40:59.990
I know,

41:00.170 --> 41:04.700
but you see--you see,
there--there's no other choice.

41:04.870 --> 41:06.310
You're my papa.

41:06.480 --> 41:08.340
I can't be your papa.

41:08.510 --> 41:11.140
You're made of wood.

41:11.310 --> 41:13.250
You're not flesh.
You're not a real boy.

41:14.720 --> 41:16.450
Now go, for everyone's good!

41:23.890 --> 41:26.730
Let's go.

41:26.900 --> 41:28.230
Son.

41:50.350 --> 41:52.180
Good boy.

42:02.400 --> 42:04.330
I love you, Papa.

42:21.150 --> 42:22.950
I'm sorry.

42:26.460 --> 42:30.390
Why does everything good
get thrown to the beasts?

42:37.600 --> 42:39.070
@ No to tyranny

42:39.240 --> 42:40.930
@ He shall not have his pleasure

42:41.100 --> 42:44.870
@ for goodness shall prevail

42:48.140 --> 42:53.510
I see gold out there--
little pieces of gold.

43:01.190 --> 43:02.620
Yeah, Woody!

43:02.790 --> 43:04.380
@ All the world is waiting

43:04.560 --> 43:06.360
@ A maiden I must save

43:06.530 --> 43:08.090
@ No time for hesitating

43:08.260 --> 43:10.530
@ If only I were brave

43:10.700 --> 43:12.530
@ For now is the hour

43:12.700 --> 43:13.900
@ I must be the hero

43:14.070 --> 43:15.770
@ It's my call, that's my cue

43:15.940 --> 43:17.930
@ It's everything or nothing

43:18.110 --> 43:20.600
@ Look out, he's coming through

43:22.340 --> 43:25.610
Sorry.
Excuse me. Pardon me.

43:28.180 --> 43:29.850
Coming through.

43:32.820 --> 43:35.810
I'll save you--

43:35.990 --> 43:37.190
Sorry.

43:38.660 --> 43:41.030
Puny peasants!

43:41.200 --> 43:43.830
I'll save you, princess.

43:44.000 --> 43:45.400
@ Oh, the giant

43:45.570 --> 43:47.400
@ Please stand up
in defiance

43:47.570 --> 43:51.400
@ The princess shall be mine!

43:52.680 --> 43:55.140
Hey, you up there
with the beard.

44:01.950 --> 44:04.010
@ I was made of freedom

44:04.190 --> 44:06.020
@ Nobody pulls my strings

44:06.190 --> 44:08.050
@ And I can equal any man

44:08.220 --> 44:12.060
@ In all the grown-up things

44:12.230 --> 44:13.390
@ And I will do or die

44:13.560 --> 44:15.430
@ For I know one thing after all

44:15.600 --> 44:17.830
@ The bigger any giant comes

44:18.000 --> 44:20.090
@ The harder he may fall

44:30.280 --> 44:33.150
@ My hero

44:33.320 --> 44:37.720
@ He saved me

44:37.890 --> 44:41.820
@ My hero, my hero, my hero,
my hero, my hero

44:45.730 --> 44:48.750
I love being a star.

44:48.930 --> 44:50.360
Of course you do.

44:50.530 --> 44:53.090
All real boys love being stars.

44:53.270 --> 44:56.070
Now this is all yours,
Pinocchio.

44:56.240 --> 44:58.970
You can buy anything you want,

44:59.140 --> 45:01.740
and after tonight,
there will be more.

45:01.880 --> 45:04.000
Here.

45:04.180 --> 45:05.110
Now hurry, son.

45:05.280 --> 45:07.310
Get ready for the next scene.

45:09.390 --> 45:10.320
Champagne.

45:10.490 --> 45:13.080
OK, kiddo, now we're
in the swing of things.

45:13.260 --> 45:16.020
Lesson number one--
beware of temptation.

45:16.190 --> 45:18.350
Applause may be good
for the moment,

45:18.530 --> 45:20.150
but love is everlasting.

45:20.330 --> 45:22.920
I do have love.
Lorenzini loves me.

45:23.100 --> 45:25.570
That's not love.
He's fooling you.

45:25.730 --> 45:27.430
He's got evil plans
in the works,

45:27.600 --> 45:29.470
and he's using you
to make them come true.

45:29.640 --> 45:32.400
Why do you have to
make everything so hard?

45:32.580 --> 45:33.970
No pain, no gain.

45:35.780 --> 45:38.270
They love us.

45:38.450 --> 45:40.420
To success.

45:44.020 --> 45:47.480
Wait till they see
what I've got for them next.

45:54.400 --> 45:55.760
Pinocchio, you're on.

46:01.370 --> 46:04.900
@ What are we made of?

46:05.070 --> 46:08.740
@ Can we know what we will be?

46:08.910 --> 46:11.540
@ What are the chances

46:11.710 --> 46:15.450
@ I can find the better path

46:15.620 --> 46:16.980
@ The better life

46:17.150 --> 46:19.920
@ The better me?

46:20.090 --> 46:24.080
@ What are we made of?

46:24.260 --> 46:26.920
@ If you think you know the answer

46:27.100 --> 46:30.690
@ Turn around

46:30.870 --> 46:34.670
@ Think again

46:35.840 --> 46:37.140
@ Carabonza!

46:37.310 --> 46:39.670
@ The fire-breathing monster

46:39.840 --> 46:42.000
@ Alas, we are undone

46:42.180 --> 46:44.040
Stand by for fireworks.

47:08.900 --> 47:10.700
Here's your proof, Pinocchio.

47:10.870 --> 47:13.930
This is how much
Lorenzini loves you.

47:14.110 --> 47:16.100
You can save the others,
if you want.

47:21.180 --> 47:23.310
This is your chance, Pinocchio.

47:23.490 --> 47:24.850
You can do what's right.

47:25.020 --> 47:27.280
Those puppets are
your brothers and sisters.

47:27.460 --> 47:29.190
Stop it.

47:29.360 --> 47:30.590
Brilliant acting, Pinocchio.

47:30.760 --> 47:33.690
Geppetto made them.
l won't let them burn.

47:33.860 --> 47:34.760
Good work!

47:34.930 --> 47:37.460
- No.
- Yes.

47:48.910 --> 47:52.110
ls it hot in here,
or is it me? Ciao!

48:18.070 --> 48:21.770
Come here, you little--

48:36.760 --> 48:37.820
There.

48:39.160 --> 48:40.320
Get him.

48:40.500 --> 48:41.330
Signor Lorenzini,

48:41.500 --> 48:43.930
I'm sorry things
didn't quite work out.

48:44.100 --> 48:46.530
I don't know. I think things
turned out rather well.

48:46.700 --> 48:48.800
I guess you'll pay us
our commission now, huh?

48:48.970 --> 48:50.960
Pay you?

48:51.140 --> 48:54.670
I will kill you if you don't
bring me that puppet.

48:59.280 --> 49:01.770
I thought you were burned.

49:05.190 --> 49:06.680
Where's my Pinocchio?

49:17.630 --> 49:20.120
There he is! On the bridge!

49:22.200 --> 49:23.730
Grab him!

49:28.380 --> 49:31.840
@ What are we made of?

49:32.010 --> 49:34.950
@ Just for this moment

49:35.120 --> 49:38.710
@ Take your life
into your hands

49:38.890 --> 49:43.190
@ You'll decide
what you are made of

49:43.360 --> 49:47.120
@ What it is that I can be

49:47.300 --> 49:50.090
@ Turn around

49:50.270 --> 49:53.360
@ Think again

50:11.220 --> 50:13.120
Pinocchio?

50:15.720 --> 50:17.390
Oh, Leona

50:17.660 --> 50:18.850
I've been all over town.

50:19.030 --> 50:20.930
So have l.
l hope you had more luck.

50:21.100 --> 50:22.590
I asked Carmella
if she'd seen Pinocchio.

50:22.760 --> 50:24.100
She said no.

50:24.270 --> 50:25.390
But then I went to see Tino.

50:25.570 --> 50:26.690
He said no.

50:26.870 --> 50:28.500
But then I went to see
Maria, the witch--

50:28.670 --> 50:30.300
the one who hasn't
spoken in years.

50:30.470 --> 50:32.700
- What did she say?
- Nothing.

50:32.880 --> 50:35.970
But... she gave me this.

50:36.140 --> 50:37.200
A stick?

50:37.380 --> 50:38.900
What's it mean?

50:39.080 --> 50:40.640
Think about it.

50:40.820 --> 50:43.050
Pinocchio probably feels like
he can't come home,

50:43.220 --> 50:44.910
like he'd only be
in trouble if he does.

50:45.090 --> 50:45.920
Yes...

50:46.090 --> 50:50.120
Where would you go
if you felt that way?

50:50.290 --> 50:52.660
l... don't know.

50:53.960 --> 50:56.290
Someplace safe.

50:56.470 --> 50:58.300
And where would that be,

50:58.470 --> 51:00.800
given the fact that
you're made out of wood?

51:03.110 --> 51:04.870
The forest.

51:05.040 --> 51:07.130
Thank you, Maria.

51:07.310 --> 51:09.640
What are you waiting for?
Let's go.

51:22.190 --> 51:24.250
Smell that pine.

51:24.430 --> 51:26.220
You know, they ought
to bottle that scent...

51:26.400 --> 51:28.260
so you can spray it
around your house.

51:28.430 --> 51:31.870
Have I told you what an honor
it is to be your cricket?

51:32.030 --> 51:35.090
You were brilliant last night.

51:35.270 --> 51:37.670
You stayed cool
when things got hot.

51:37.840 --> 51:40.870
You did the right thing,
and you deserve to be proud.

51:41.040 --> 51:42.700
This is where I belong.

51:42.880 --> 51:45.970
You know, I prefer
the beach myself,

51:46.150 --> 51:48.340
but property there
is so expensive.

51:54.490 --> 51:57.690
You've gone back to your roots.

51:57.860 --> 51:59.990
I know you feel lost, Pinocchio.

52:00.160 --> 52:05.120
Believe me, it's only natural,
but you can't stay here.

52:05.300 --> 52:06.700
Go away, please.

52:06.870 --> 52:09.130
I fell happy here.

52:09.300 --> 52:11.430
You can't sleep
your problems away.

52:11.610 --> 52:13.130
You've got to get back
to your papa.

52:13.310 --> 52:14.300
Bye.

52:14.480 --> 52:16.940
We've got to roll.
Let's make tracks. Let's go!

52:17.110 --> 52:20.600
Follow me! Off we go!

52:20.780 --> 52:22.370
Run. Run. Run.

52:29.260 --> 52:30.350
Pepe?

52:41.970 --> 52:44.030
Where are you when I need you?

52:53.720 --> 52:55.950
Quit it!

52:56.120 --> 52:58.750
Peck on someone your own size.

52:58.920 --> 53:00.750
''Let's get into
the puppet business,'' you said.

53:00.920 --> 53:02.150
- I never--
- Shut up!

53:02.320 --> 53:04.320
- ''We'll be rich,'' you said.
- I didn't...

53:04.360 --> 53:07.260
Shut up. ''He's worth
a fortune,'' you said.

53:07.430 --> 53:08.990
Why do I always listen to you?

53:10.770 --> 53:11.760
Get off!

53:11.930 --> 53:12.990
Go away.

53:13.170 --> 53:14.160
Who do you suppose
that might be?

53:14.340 --> 53:16.630
Are you serious?

53:16.810 --> 53:18.430
Go away.

53:18.470 --> 53:19.600
Pinocchio!

53:35.090 --> 53:37.250
Out of my way.

54:14.000 --> 54:17.900
Let's put Lorenzini off
for just a few more minutes.

54:29.710 --> 54:31.840
Hey, I know you.

54:32.010 --> 54:33.740
You're friends with Lorenzini.

54:33.920 --> 54:35.580
We're finished with him now.

54:35.750 --> 54:37.720
- We're repugnant.
- Repentant.

54:37.890 --> 54:39.220
Yeah, that, too.

54:40.790 --> 54:44.120
And we're here to
ask for forgiveness.

54:44.290 --> 54:45.730
What's forgiveness?

54:45.890 --> 54:48.450
Forgiveness means that when
you did something really wrong,

54:48.630 --> 54:50.960
you want somebody to tell you...

54:51.130 --> 54:52.330
that it wasn't
really, really wrong,

54:52.500 --> 54:55.160
when you know what you did
was wrong because you did it!

54:57.710 --> 55:00.370
Please forgive me
for being a puppet,

55:00.540 --> 55:03.910
instead of a real boy
for my papa.

55:05.510 --> 55:07.350
I miss my daddy, too.

55:08.480 --> 55:10.310
You know,
it is possible...

55:10.490 --> 55:12.980
for you to become a real boy.

55:13.160 --> 55:14.880
How?

55:15.060 --> 55:16.680
All you need is a miracle.

55:16.860 --> 55:18.050
What's a miracle?

55:18.230 --> 55:20.060
A miracle is--

55:20.230 --> 55:22.200
Miracles make your dreams
come true,

55:22.360 --> 55:24.160
and you could buy one...

55:24.330 --> 55:25.770
with enough of these.

55:25.930 --> 55:29.060
Look... I have four more.

55:30.540 --> 55:31.870
Very good.

55:32.040 --> 55:35.070
Will you people be quiet!

55:37.050 --> 55:40.070
Unfortunately,
you're just a little short.

55:41.920 --> 55:45.110
But you might have enough if...

55:45.290 --> 55:47.150
If what?

55:47.320 --> 55:50.090
If you planted them
and let them grow.

55:50.260 --> 55:51.890
Where?

55:52.060 --> 55:55.050
Why, in the field of miracles,
of course.

55:55.230 --> 55:58.890
The field of miracles.

56:00.800 --> 56:02.030
Faster.

56:02.200 --> 56:04.430
Found the perfect spot.

56:04.610 --> 56:06.340
Stop. That's deep enough.

56:06.510 --> 56:08.910
Now cover the hole
and let it cook.

56:09.080 --> 56:09.940
For one hour.

56:10.110 --> 56:11.600
Exactly.

56:13.850 --> 56:15.320
Just keep going this way.

56:15.480 --> 56:17.380
Leona, please, don't tell me
about the forest.

56:17.550 --> 56:19.540
I've been coming out here with
my brother, Enzio--

56:19.720 --> 56:21.750
may he rest in peace--
since I was a little boy.

56:21.920 --> 56:23.410
Stop.

56:31.470 --> 56:34.460
He was here.
Maybe he's not far off.

56:38.440 --> 56:42.040
Now you stand here
and watch that clock.

56:42.210 --> 56:44.610
The big hand will go
all the way around...

56:44.780 --> 56:47.980
and come back to the top,
and that's an hour.

56:48.150 --> 56:49.740
Got it?

56:51.150 --> 56:52.310
Got it.

57:27.490 --> 57:31.690
@ Our souls are like
a cup of cappuccino

57:31.860 --> 57:33.420
@ Strong and dark

57:33.600 --> 57:35.320
@ Strong and dark

57:35.500 --> 57:37.990
Out of the woods, huh?
What are you doing now?

57:38.170 --> 57:39.830
Watching the clock.

57:40.000 --> 57:40.830
Why?

57:41.000 --> 57:42.300
So I can buy a miracle.

57:42.470 --> 57:44.440
Any particular brand?

57:44.610 --> 57:47.340
Real Boy brand.
Here's how it works--

57:47.510 --> 57:50.240
You dig a hole, you plant
your gold, you let it cook--

57:50.410 --> 57:52.900
The first lesson about trust
is learning whom to trust.

57:53.080 --> 57:55.110
Didn't this gold deal
seem a little shaky?

57:55.280 --> 57:56.510
I don't know.

57:56.690 --> 57:57.880
A little.

57:58.050 --> 58:01.490
And let me guess...
you ignored your instincts.

58:01.660 --> 58:03.590
- Didn't you?
- Maybe.

58:03.760 --> 58:07.990
You just don't give maybe to the
president of the Cricket Union.

58:08.160 --> 58:11.430
Now, let's say we regroup
and talk about your papa.

58:11.600 --> 58:14.070
Or I'll be falling down
on the job.

58:15.140 --> 58:18.590
Look, my papa wants me
to be a real boy.

58:18.770 --> 58:21.330
I'm staying right here
and waiting for my miracle.

58:21.510 --> 58:25.380
Your papa want you,
no matter what you're made of.

58:25.550 --> 58:26.880
Be a loving son,

58:27.050 --> 58:29.610
and the real boy stuff
will take care of itself.

58:29.780 --> 58:32.550
So remember,
you heard it here first.

58:32.720 --> 58:35.420
Miracles don't grow on trees.

58:35.590 --> 58:38.180
Miracles are made in the heart.

59:02.020 --> 59:03.880
Stupid me!

59:05.150 --> 59:07.780
Miracles don't grow on trees.
Miracles don't grow on trees.

59:34.380 --> 59:36.110
Hey, Woody!

59:36.280 --> 59:37.950
Stop!

59:39.790 --> 59:41.380
Come on. Come with us.

59:41.560 --> 59:43.180
We're going to
the greatest place.

59:43.360 --> 59:44.660
It's great. There's no school.

59:44.830 --> 59:46.620
No rules.
You can do whatever you want.

59:46.800 --> 59:48.850
And it's just for boys.

59:49.030 --> 59:50.330
Just for boys?

59:50.500 --> 59:52.090
Yep. Real boys.

01:00:10.820 --> 01:00:13.310
Look. Look. There he is.

01:00:14.460 --> 01:00:16.290
Where? I don't see him.

01:00:16.460 --> 01:00:17.580
I'm sure.

01:00:46.350 --> 01:00:49.920
I'm going to be a real boy!

01:00:57.370 --> 01:00:59.420
Hey, Woody,
watch out for your hat.

01:01:47.220 --> 01:01:50.450
Welcome to the Terra Magica!

01:01:55.790 --> 01:01:57.620
New boys.

01:01:58.430 --> 01:01:59.450
NO NOISE

01:01:59.490 --> 01:02:01.960
Wait a minute.
l thought there were--

01:02:02.130 --> 01:02:05.660
I forgot the biggest rule
of them all!

01:02:05.830 --> 01:02:08.030
There are no rules.

01:02:08.200 --> 01:02:11.100
That's more like it!

01:02:13.580 --> 01:02:14.600
NO LYING

01:02:50.980 --> 01:02:52.500
He's out there.

01:02:53.510 --> 01:02:55.640
Not necessarily.

01:02:55.820 --> 01:02:57.180
What do you think this is?

01:02:57.350 --> 01:03:00.250
It's his hat,
the one I gave to him.

01:03:00.420 --> 01:03:02.320
I'm going to go find him.

01:03:02.490 --> 01:03:04.720
Now wait one minute.

01:03:04.890 --> 01:03:07.620
You're going to kill youself
for one of your puppets?

01:03:11.100 --> 01:03:12.530
He's my son.

01:03:17.070 --> 01:03:20.400
I've already let one great love
slip through my fingers.

01:03:20.580 --> 01:03:22.910
I don't want it to happen again.

01:03:23.080 --> 01:03:25.070
You've never been in a boat
in your life.

01:03:25.250 --> 01:03:26.610
You can't even swim.

01:03:26.780 --> 01:03:28.210
I can row.

01:03:28.380 --> 01:03:31.650
But, Geppetto...
you may never come back.

01:03:31.820 --> 01:03:33.950
In that case,
I'll tell you why...

01:03:34.120 --> 01:03:36.390
you should never
have married my brother.

01:03:36.560 --> 01:03:37.390
Why?

01:03:37.560 --> 01:03:40.860
Because you should have
married me!

01:03:41.030 --> 01:03:43.830
The day I carved that heart
in the tree,

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.470
you accepted
my brother's proposal.

01:03:46.630 --> 01:03:50.800
25 years you take to tell me,
and I'm supposed to wait?

01:03:50.970 --> 01:03:53.960
You're too late.
I'm not waiting!

01:04:05.520 --> 01:04:07.390
This is foul.

01:04:07.560 --> 01:04:08.520
Foul?

01:04:08.690 --> 01:04:10.720
Come on, Woody,
you're missing all the fun!

01:04:25.170 --> 01:04:27.110
Hey, your turn, Woody!

01:04:31.450 --> 01:04:34.850
Rather cruel of you to shoot
my cousins into outer space.

01:04:35.020 --> 01:04:37.110
All I'm doing
is having a little fun.

01:04:37.290 --> 01:04:39.010
Fun? Your idea of fun...

01:04:39.190 --> 01:04:41.490
puts my antenna
way out of whack,

01:04:41.660 --> 01:04:44.220
and what about your papa,
since you brought him up?

01:04:44.390 --> 01:04:45.860
I didn't bring him up.

01:04:46.030 --> 01:04:48.520
Precisely my point!

01:04:48.700 --> 01:04:51.670
You know he wouldn't want you
acting like a jackass,

01:04:51.830 --> 01:04:55.200
and if you act like one,
you'll become one!

01:04:55.370 --> 01:04:57.840
This is how you light it,
Woody.

01:04:58.010 --> 01:04:59.400
That's it.

01:05:03.240 --> 01:05:04.730
I can't go on a trip.

01:05:04.910 --> 01:05:07.380
I forgot to go to the bathroom!

01:05:15.260 --> 01:05:18.950
Act like a jackass,
if you have the nerve.

01:05:19.130 --> 01:05:22.560
Drink up the water.
Get what you deserve.

01:05:22.730 --> 01:05:24.820
Be wicked, be naughty.

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.330
Come drink from my fountain,

01:05:27.500 --> 01:05:31.440
then I will be rich--
king of the mountain.

01:05:36.780 --> 01:05:38.300
Let me try.

01:05:42.520 --> 01:05:44.210
Nice shooting.

01:05:44.390 --> 01:05:47.480
Look. No, look...
I'll show you how.

01:05:47.660 --> 01:05:48.820
No!

01:05:48.990 --> 01:05:50.250
Sorry.

01:05:50.430 --> 01:05:52.260
That's my gun.

01:05:52.430 --> 01:05:54.050
No, it's mine, Lampshade.

01:05:54.230 --> 01:05:56.630
Nobody calls me Lampshade.

01:06:00.370 --> 01:06:02.390
You give me the gun.

01:06:15.220 --> 01:06:16.340
Nice shot.

01:06:16.520 --> 01:06:18.010
Hey...

01:06:18.190 --> 01:06:21.050
I can see right through him.

01:06:21.220 --> 01:06:22.710
What's all this?

01:06:24.530 --> 01:06:25.490
He started it.

01:06:25.660 --> 01:06:26.490
You liar.

01:06:26.660 --> 01:06:28.790
Stop! Let's settle this.

01:06:31.500 --> 01:06:35.030
Tokens for
the ride of your life.

01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:38.760
You have all earned it.

01:06:38.940 --> 01:06:41.030
For you...

01:06:41.210 --> 01:06:42.770
and you.

01:06:45.580 --> 01:06:47.310
Hey, swiss cheese,
we're going on the big one.

01:06:47.480 --> 01:06:48.740
Me, too.

01:07:08.270 --> 01:07:10.860
Sell these jackasses
to the circus...

01:07:11.040 --> 01:07:14.870
and at the market--
20,000 lira each--

01:07:15.040 --> 01:07:18.270
then skin one...
for a new pair of boots.

01:07:23.680 --> 01:07:25.620
We're going on
the big one, Woody.

01:07:25.790 --> 01:07:27.280
The big one.

01:07:30.790 --> 01:07:32.660
Here we go.

01:07:32.830 --> 01:07:34.120
Aw, yeah.

01:07:44.010 --> 01:07:45.800
Coming through!

01:07:47.780 --> 01:07:50.440
I'm a real boy.
I'm a real boy.

01:07:57.490 --> 01:08:00.450
Come on! Whoa! Faster!

01:08:23.580 --> 01:08:24.939
All right!

01:08:25.109 --> 01:08:27.710
Hey, Woody, you're leaking!

01:08:27.880 --> 01:08:31.370
I guess some guys
just can't hold their water.

01:08:34.990 --> 01:08:36.350
Faster!

01:08:44.270 --> 01:08:47.229
What's wrong with you?

01:08:47.399 --> 01:08:48.930
I don't know.
l don't feel so good.

01:08:49.100 --> 01:08:50.800
You don't
look so good, either.

01:08:54.910 --> 01:08:56.470
Where'd you get that?

01:09:31.609 --> 01:09:34.080
Here's another batch, signor.

01:09:37.250 --> 01:09:39.189
Corral them.

01:09:41.760 --> 01:09:44.450
I don't want to be a jackass.
l don't want to be a jackass.

01:09:44.630 --> 01:09:46.960
Don't panic, Pinocchio.
Keep your wits.

01:09:47.130 --> 01:09:49.100
Please, Pepe,
get me out of here.

01:09:49.260 --> 01:09:52.660
You can do it. Be brave.
Don't let fear tie you up.

01:09:56.770 --> 01:09:58.640
Yikes!

01:10:00.440 --> 01:10:03.840
One of them didn't
drink their water, signor!

01:10:09.280 --> 01:10:10.000
- Catch him!
- He's gone.

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:11.480
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to
- Catch him!
- He's gone.

01:10:11.480 --> 01:10:11.650
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

01:10:11.650 --> 01:10:15.450
Don't let him get away!
Go and find him!
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

01:10:15.450 --> 01:10:15.620
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

01:10:15.620 --> 01:10:17.420
There...behind the donkey.
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

01:10:17.420 --> 01:10:17.590
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

01:10:17.590 --> 01:10:20.360
Calm these donkeys!
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

01:10:20.360 --> 01:10:21.600
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

01:10:21.600 --> 01:10:22.000
Of course, signore.
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:23.260
Of course, signore.

01:10:24.970 --> 01:10:28.560
Go. Go. Go.

01:10:28.740 --> 01:10:30.600
Come on. Go.

01:10:30.770 --> 01:10:31.970
Run!

01:10:51.960 --> 01:10:53.020
Get him!

01:10:56.430 --> 01:10:59.630
I will break you
into firewood...

01:10:59.800 --> 01:11:01.730
puppet!

01:11:01.840 --> 01:11:05.240
Come here. Over here.

01:11:05.410 --> 01:11:08.970
No, this is all wrong.
You got to believe me.

01:11:09.140 --> 01:11:10.670
Look, they're
trying to trick you.

01:11:10.850 --> 01:11:12.680
They wants us
to behave badly.

01:11:12.850 --> 01:11:14.470
Don't go on the ride. Please!

01:11:14.650 --> 01:11:16.480
We've been acting
like jackasses,

01:11:16.650 --> 01:11:18.350
so that's what we turn into.

01:11:18.520 --> 01:11:19.820
Well, well, well...

01:11:19.990 --> 01:11:25.190
Here I provide you with the most
wonderful place to frolic,

01:11:25.360 --> 01:11:28.120
and this is the thanks I get?

01:11:28.300 --> 01:11:31.090
You steal my donkeys?

01:11:31.270 --> 01:11:32.890
They're not your donkeys.

01:11:33.070 --> 01:11:35.000
This one's Lampwick.

01:11:39.910 --> 01:11:42.840
Pinocchio, a good boy does not
go around spreading lies.

01:11:43.010 --> 01:11:45.000
It's not a lie.

01:11:45.180 --> 01:11:47.270
My nose grows when I lie.

01:11:47.450 --> 01:11:50.380
Come on, boys. Take the ride.

01:11:50.550 --> 01:11:52.380
Drink the water.

01:11:52.550 --> 01:11:53.710
No, don't!

01:11:55.420 --> 01:11:57.080
Be yourselves!

01:11:57.260 --> 01:11:59.620
Lampwick...

01:12:01.060 --> 01:12:02.290
Go on.

01:12:24.820 --> 01:12:26.290
He's turning into a monster.

01:12:28.620 --> 01:12:29.850
Look at his face.

01:12:30.020 --> 01:12:31.690
Lorenzini's turned
into a monster.

01:12:39.070 --> 01:12:41.090
Lorenzini was a monster.

01:12:41.270 --> 01:12:44.500
He was a monster
and got what he deserved.

01:12:51.910 --> 01:12:53.380
Jackasses!

01:12:56.620 --> 01:12:58.590
I'm going home.

01:13:00.120 --> 01:13:01.820
Thanks, Pinocchio.

01:13:13.100 --> 01:13:15.630
Home home home home!

01:13:20.010 --> 01:13:23.530
I don't care if I never
become a real boy anymore.

01:13:23.710 --> 01:13:26.540
I just want
to get home to my papa.

01:13:28.220 --> 01:13:29.270
There you are.

01:13:33.350 --> 01:13:36.410
I knew you didn't go out to sea.

01:13:36.590 --> 01:13:37.780
Where have you been?

01:13:37.960 --> 01:13:40.320
We were so worried,
and look at you.

01:13:40.490 --> 01:13:41.620
Have you eaten?

01:13:41.800 --> 01:13:43.700
You're so skinny.

01:13:43.860 --> 01:13:45.590
Where is my papa?

01:13:49.340 --> 01:13:52.790
He's out there somewhere,
looking for you.

01:13:55.280 --> 01:13:56.400
Wait, Pinocchio!

01:13:56.580 --> 01:13:58.070
It's too dangerous.

01:14:06.820 --> 01:14:08.480
If you think
I'm going to wait...

01:14:08.660 --> 01:14:10.060
for both of you--

01:14:10.220 --> 01:14:12.420
You don't even know how to swim.

01:14:46.530 --> 01:14:48.550
I'm not scared.

01:14:48.730 --> 01:14:50.630
I'm not scared.

01:15:50.920 --> 01:15:53.920
I smell seaweed.
Are--are we at the beach?

01:15:54.930 --> 01:15:57.260
Pepe, I thought you left me.

01:15:57.430 --> 01:15:59.590
Ahoy, captain.
Where are we now?

01:15:59.770 --> 01:16:02.200
Boy, you sure get
into a let of trouble.

01:16:02.370 --> 01:16:04.770
You know,
it smells an awful lot...

01:16:04.940 --> 01:16:06.770
like rotten
chili peppers in here.

01:16:06.940 --> 01:16:10.070
Lorenzini, he must be
the sea monster.

01:16:10.240 --> 01:16:11.180
OK. Fine. Enjoy yourself.

01:16:11.350 --> 01:16:13.750
I'm playing
cricket this afternoon.

01:16:13.910 --> 01:16:15.780
Hey, I'm a clamophobic.

01:16:15.950 --> 01:16:17.250
Quiet.

01:16:17.420 --> 01:16:18.940
We're in this together, now.

01:16:19.120 --> 01:16:21.780
But--but--but I'm
afraid of the dark.

01:16:22.790 --> 01:16:23.690
Papa!

01:16:23.860 --> 01:16:26.350
Oh, sure, like he's
just around the corner.

01:16:26.530 --> 01:16:27.460
He might be.

01:16:27.630 --> 01:16:30.690
Oh, you two had plans
to meet here for dinner?

01:16:30.860 --> 01:16:32.890
- Quiet.
- Sorry.

01:16:42.310 --> 01:16:44.800
Excuse me.

01:16:44.980 --> 01:16:47.110
Coming through.

01:16:55.520 --> 01:16:58.180
If only it were true.

01:17:19.810 --> 01:17:21.710
Where were you?

01:17:30.790 --> 01:17:33.780
Let's try to find
a way out of here.

01:17:33.960 --> 01:17:35.050
Come.

01:17:35.230 --> 01:17:38.360
It smells like
rotten chili peppers in here.

01:17:49.580 --> 01:17:50.840
The throat.

01:17:51.850 --> 01:17:54.180
hold on.
Pinocchio, hold on.

01:18:03.790 --> 01:18:05.350
Go, Pinocchio.

01:18:05.530 --> 01:18:06.860
Not without you.

01:18:07.030 --> 01:18:08.190
Go, I said.

01:18:08.360 --> 01:18:09.450
No. Push it open.

01:18:09.630 --> 01:18:11.120
I can't get through there.

01:18:11.300 --> 01:18:12.930
Now, do as I say!

01:18:30.050 --> 01:18:31.750
I hate you, Papa.

01:18:33.420 --> 01:18:34.790
What?

01:18:35.920 --> 01:18:37.520
I never, ever missed you.

01:18:38.660 --> 01:18:39.790
That's a lie.

01:18:44.100 --> 01:18:47.330
I wish I never found you.

01:18:50.040 --> 01:18:51.330
I never wanted to be your son.

01:18:51.510 --> 01:18:53.500
I want to stay a puppet.

01:18:53.670 --> 01:18:56.370
Lies, all lies.

01:19:47.890 --> 01:19:50.190
Don't judge my cooking
by this, OK?

01:20:11.590 --> 01:20:13.050
Are you OK, Papa?

01:20:19.030 --> 01:20:20.020
Wake up.

01:20:35.540 --> 01:20:38.510
Forgive me, Pinocchio...

01:20:38.680 --> 01:20:41.770
for doubting my heart
and letting you go.

01:20:44.580 --> 01:20:46.920
I'm sorry, too, Papa.

01:20:48.160 --> 01:20:50.150
I'm sorry for not...

01:20:52.090 --> 01:20:54.220
for not being a real boy.

01:20:57.130 --> 01:21:00.360
But you're real to me,
my son.

01:21:00.530 --> 01:21:02.200
Real to me.

01:21:04.100 --> 01:21:05.570
Oh, I love you.

01:21:06.570 --> 01:21:08.730
I love you, too, Papa.

01:22:32.130 --> 01:22:33.650
I'm a boy.

01:22:33.830 --> 01:22:35.730
Tell me it's true.

01:22:37.260 --> 01:22:39.430
Miracles are made
in the heart, Papa.

01:22:45.770 --> 01:22:49.830
Yoo-hoo, hello.
I'm in the dark in here.

01:22:50.010 --> 01:22:53.040
What am I missing?
Have the pilgrims landed?

01:23:04.060 --> 01:23:06.120
I don't even want
to know what happened.

01:23:06.290 --> 01:23:08.120
Keep it to yourself.

01:23:08.300 --> 01:23:09.630
Nice to know you, junior.

01:23:09.800 --> 01:23:11.200
Lots of luck.

01:23:11.360 --> 01:23:14.390
You look good in the flesh,
a real doll--uh, boy,

01:23:14.570 --> 01:23:15.800
but I got to go. Ciao.

01:23:15.970 --> 01:23:17.160
You're leaving again?

01:23:17.340 --> 01:23:19.130
I'm just starting
to have a good time.

01:23:19.310 --> 01:23:20.330
Leaving?

01:23:20.510 --> 01:23:22.840
That would make me
a hypo-cricket.

01:23:23.010 --> 01:23:24.870
Union rules--
I'm with you forever.

01:23:25.050 --> 01:23:27.100
I just got to get some sleep.

01:23:32.250 --> 01:23:34.410
Papa! Pap, stop the cart.

01:23:34.590 --> 01:23:36.150
- What?
- Please stop the cart.

01:23:36.320 --> 01:23:37.650
There's just
one more little thing...

01:23:37.820 --> 01:23:39.550
I need to take care of.
It'll only take a minute.

01:23:44.330 --> 01:23:46.160
I'm not going
to sleep in no barn.

01:23:46.330 --> 01:23:47.800
Fine, then sleep
in the doghouse.

01:23:48.840 --> 01:23:50.130
Hello.

01:23:52.340 --> 01:23:55.100
Don't you answer back
when a person greets you?

01:23:55.280 --> 01:23:56.110
Hello.

01:23:56.280 --> 01:23:58.010
Haven't I seen you
somewhere before?

01:23:58.180 --> 01:24:01.940
No. Believe me,
l just got here.

01:24:02.120 --> 01:24:04.520
That sure isn't very much gold
you've got there.

01:24:04.750 --> 01:24:08.020
Excuse me, sonny. We're rich.

01:24:08.190 --> 01:24:09.680
That's not rich.

01:24:09.860 --> 01:24:11.450
This is rich.

01:24:13.560 --> 01:24:15.460
That's nothing but a rock.

01:24:15.630 --> 01:24:19.190
Yes, but if you take this road
five miles, there's a valley.

01:24:19.370 --> 01:24:20.360
I've been there.

01:24:20.530 --> 01:24:23.030
Drinking the water
turns bad boys into donkeys.

01:24:23.200 --> 01:24:24.260
Get out of here.

01:24:24.440 --> 01:24:26.840
Fine, then I won't
tell you about the gold.

01:24:27.010 --> 01:24:28.200
Gold?

01:24:28.380 --> 01:24:29.710
Keep this to yourselves.

01:24:29.880 --> 01:24:31.370
If you drink the water
while holding onto a rock...

01:24:31.550 --> 01:24:32.380
Yeah?

01:24:32.550 --> 01:24:33.570
It turns into gold.

01:24:33.750 --> 01:24:35.720
Gold?

01:24:35.880 --> 01:24:37.180
Would I lie?

01:24:39.090 --> 01:24:40.210
Bye.

01:24:44.420 --> 01:24:45.820
See you later, Papa.

01:24:45.990 --> 01:24:47.520
Pinocchio,
where are you going?

01:24:47.690 --> 01:24:49.220
To play with Lampwick.

01:24:49.400 --> 01:24:51.760
Did you do your studies
and all of your chores?

01:24:51.930 --> 01:24:53.190
Yes, Papa.

01:24:53.370 --> 01:24:56.060
Sometimes I wish
that nose still grew.

01:24:56.240 --> 01:24:57.360
Lampwick.

01:25:00.640 --> 01:25:02.700
Come on, Woody, let's go.

01:25:04.680 --> 01:25:06.040
Careful!

01:25:07.950 --> 01:25:09.510
We're--we're very sorry, sir.

01:25:09.680 --> 01:25:10.980
Yeah. Let us pick these up.

01:25:11.150 --> 01:25:15.710
- Don't you just hate that kid?
- Not as much as I hate you.

01:25:17.260 --> 01:25:18.250
Papa, Papa,

01:25:18.430 --> 01:25:20.220
I've got a great idea.

01:25:20.390 --> 01:25:23.450
How about carving me
a girlfriend?

01:25:23.630 --> 01:25:25.530
You've been a boy two minutes,

01:25:25.700 --> 01:25:27.360
already you're
thinking about girls?

01:25:27.530 --> 01:25:30.770
Am I going
to have trouble with you!

01:25:36.210 --> 01:25:37.900
And there you have it.

01:25:38.080 --> 01:25:42.240
Geppetto and Leona
lived happily ever after.

01:25:42.420 --> 01:25:44.470
Luigi ate a lot of socks,

01:25:44.650 --> 01:25:47.250
and all the donkeys
turned back into boys.

01:25:47.420 --> 01:25:49.010
It took some hard work.

01:25:49.190 --> 01:25:52.350
They had to do many good deeds
to earn the privilege.

01:25:52.530 --> 01:25:55.190
As for me,
l took a house on Lake Como...

01:25:55.360 --> 01:25:57.690
and played canasta
with a couple of locusts.

01:25:57.860 --> 01:25:59.730
So, ciao, my little saplings.
Arrivederci!

01:25:59.900 --> 01:26:02.700
And when you need me,
give me a holler.

01:26:02.870 --> 01:26:05.960
We'll see if we can
arrange something.
