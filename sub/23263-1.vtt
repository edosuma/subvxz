I'll have to check. Why?

I'm not sure.

I'll call you back.
Thanks, Brian.

Morning, David.

last week.

It's OK. I know you're busy.
I don't mind busy, it's...

05:34.899 --> 05:36.420
Oh, well. No excuses.

05:37.980 --> 05:41.379
You're just one of the few people
I'd rather see than not.

05:41.379 --> 05:42.579
Thank you.

05:42.620 --> 05:43.819
Come in.

05:45.060 --> 05:47.338
My husband dropped dead
right in front of me

05:47.340 --> 05:50.858
and it turned out that
sitting at home was a disaster.

05:50.860 --> 05:53.980
I'm not saying you should go back
to work, either, by the way.

05:55.019 --> 05:57.180
But you were glad you did?

05:57.220 --> 05:59.058
It was right for me.

05:59.060 --> 06:03.899
But only you know what you went
through, what you need to do.

06:03.939 --> 06:06.980
You've been home... six weeks?

06:08.220 --> 06:09.620
Two months.

06:10.819 --> 06:13.699
In one sense that's no time at all.
But in another...

06:13.699 --> 06:15.298
It's an eternity.

06:15.300 --> 06:19.220
Only you know which - everyone else
can respectfully shut up.

06:22.019 --> 06:25.259
After Mexico... I didn't
want to come home.

06:25.259 --> 06:27.699
I stopped off in New York,
did I tell you?

06:27.699 --> 06:29.538
You said you made a pit-stop.

06:29.540 --> 06:31.298
What happened?

06:31.300 --> 06:35.218
For about 48 hours,
it was incredible.

06:35.220 --> 06:39.459
I didn't feel scared,
I didn't feel relieved...

06:39.500 --> 06:42.459
I felt alive, awake,

06:42.500 --> 06:44.899
and I wanted to hold on to that.

06:45.980 --> 06:47.259
And then you woke up?

06:49.620 --> 06:51.459
Now I'm scared, Sally.

06:52.899 --> 06:54.860
I'm scared of my own shadow.

06:54.899 --> 06:58.778
I'm scared of the bloody dark,
and that's not me.

06:58.779 --> 07:00.379
And that makes you angry?

07:00.379 --> 07:01.620
Furious.

07:01.660 --> 07:03.139
Come here.

07:32.259 --> 07:34.699
What're you doing, David?
I just want to talk.

07:34.740 --> 07:35.939
You've had all day to talk.

07:35.939 --> 07:38.379
Except every time I try,
you brush me off.

07:40.019 --> 07:42.259
If Brian Hawke wants a word,
no problem, yeah?

07:42.259 --> 07:44.259
But your own colleague...
That is such bullshit.

07:44.300 --> 07:46.538
At least allow me to explain
how it would work.

07:46.540 --> 07:48.899
You don't even have to be
directly involved.

07:48.939 --> 07:50.019

please leave a message.

08:30.819 --> 08:32.980
Sally, it's Nikki.

08:33.019 --> 08:36.220
Checking in with you again
like you said to.

08:36.259 --> 08:39.179
I know you're up to your eyes,
but...

08:39.220 --> 08:41.580
..text me, call me, whatever.

08:41.620 --> 08:44.818
I haven't heard back from you -
you've got me worried.

08:44.820 --> 08:48.418
It's probably just my paranoia,
I'm sure there's nothing...

08:48.419 --> 08:50.219
Sorry. Rambling.

08:50.220 --> 08:52.778
Just let me know you got this.

08:52.779 --> 08:54.100
Lots of love.

09:54.299 --> 09:56.100
Sorry, can I help you?

09:56.980 --> 10:00.178
Where's Sally? What's going on?
What's your connection?

10:00.179 --> 10:04.458
I'm a friend of hers.
Is she OK? Who are you?

10:04.460 --> 10:08.100
Guy Bernhardt. NCA.
Can I see some ID?

10:13.580 --> 10:15.019
Sorry.

10:16.820 --> 10:18.019
Nikki Alexander.

10:19.860 --> 10:22.179
Right, well, I'm afraid
she's gone missing.

10:23.539 --> 10:25.700
How long? Three days.

10:25.740 --> 10:28.940
But couldn't she...?
She didn't turn up for court.

10:28.980 --> 10:31.419
When did you last see her?

10:31.460 --> 10:33.499
Er...

10:33.500 --> 10:35.820
Four days ago... Tuesday?

10:37.580 --> 10:41.179
Oh, my God... Don't panic.
We'll go and sit down.

10:45.460 --> 10:47.580
So how long have you known her?

10:47.620 --> 10:48.899
Er...

10:50.460 --> 10:52.980
We worked together
on a difficult case

10:53.019 --> 10:55.139
and we stayed in touch as friends.

10:55.139 --> 10:58.658
And when you saw her last Tuesday,
how did she...?

10:58.659 --> 11:00.899
How did she come across?

11:03.700 --> 11:05.179
A bit distracted.

11:06.419 --> 11:07.500
Tense.

11:09.059 --> 11:12.259
She said she didn't mind being busy
like...

11:13.899 --> 11:16.419
..like there was something else
bothering her

11:16.460 --> 11:18.379
other than day-to-day stuff.

11:18.419 --> 11:19.980
Anything specific?

11:21.820 --> 11:24.458
She was selling her lab.
Did you know that?

11:24.460 --> 11:25.698
Mm-hmm.

11:25.700 --> 11:28.740
One of her staff
had made her an offer.

11:28.779 --> 11:31.578
If Sally signed over
the lab to them,

11:31.580 --> 11:34.019
then she'd get a cut,
something like that.

11:34.019 --> 11:35.739
She wasn't interested?

11:35.740 --> 11:40.299
No, but they were being difficult.
Weren't taking no for an answer.

11:42.179 --> 11:46.418
She didn't say the word "bullied",
but that's what it sounded like.

11:46.419 --> 11:48.419
Are we talking about David Cannon?

11:50.460 --> 11:52.059
Is he a suspect?

11:52.100 --> 11:53.938
He's a person of interest.

11:53.940 --> 11:55.338
Why?

11:55.340 --> 11:57.580
He's just one of a number
of leads we're... Why?

11:59.059 --> 12:02.460
Four years ago, he was arrested
for falsifying PM reports.

12:03.740 --> 12:05.099
But he wasn't charged?

12:05.100 --> 12:08.059
No, but he still warrants
a closer look.

12:10.299 --> 12:13.219
I asked David Cannon
when he last saw Sally.

12:13.220 --> 12:15.259
He said Tuesday at the lab.

12:15.299 --> 12:17.860
But we pulled his fingerprints
off a smashed mug

12:17.899 --> 12:19.460
found in her kitchen bin.

12:21.539 --> 12:23.979
But that doesn't mean...
He said, HE said,

12:23.980 --> 12:27.820
the last time he'd been there was
a Christmas party two years ago.

12:29.299 --> 12:31.580
How did he explain it?
Didn't ask him to.

12:31.620 --> 12:34.740
Why? He knows the drill.

12:34.779 --> 12:36.980
If we show our hand,
he'll clam up and get a lawyer.

12:37.019 --> 12:39.219
Then, of course,
if he does know where Sally is...

12:39.220 --> 12:41.658
He'll never tell you. Exactly.

12:41.659 --> 12:44.499
We've closed the lab on a ruse
that we're looking into old cases

12:44.500 --> 12:46.538
that might explain
her disappearance.

12:46.539 --> 12:49.740
We applied for warrants to search
his flat and access his phone,

12:49.779 --> 12:52.379
both denied.
Now you can tell me to buzz off...

12:54.059 --> 12:55.620
..but maybe you can help us?

12:57.019 --> 12:58.620
APPLAUSE

12:58.659 --> 13:01.700
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you
very much for joining us.

13:01.740 --> 13:03.940
Early on, somebody said to me,

13:03.980 --> 13:07.178
"Starting your own club
isn't a sprint, it's a marathon."

13:07.179 --> 13:08.818
Having run a few marathons myself,

13:08.820 --> 13:10.659
I can safely say
that was a cruel lie.

13:12.019 --> 13:14.259
It's been a hard road,

13:14.259 --> 13:16.379
and I would've given up years ago

13:16.379 --> 13:19.059
without the faith
and encouragement of my wife Emma.

13:23.340 --> 13:26.340
Even now, we're not quite there
on our funding.

13:28.179 --> 13:31.620
Which is why you've all been
invited here today.

13:31.659 --> 13:34.538
Anyway, I'm sure you've all heard
quite enough from me.

13:34.539 --> 13:37.460
Now it's your turn.
Does anybody have any questions?

13:37.500 --> 13:40.580
Yes. What's the total budget
for this project?

13:48.139 --> 13:49.580
BEEP, DOOR UNLOCKS

14:15.340 --> 14:16.500
Hi.

14:19.379 --> 14:21.899
What the hell are you doing here?

14:21.940 --> 14:23.820
Nice to see you, too, Thomas.

14:27.659 --> 14:31.419
So we're offering this guy a job
just so we can keep an eye on him?

14:31.460 --> 14:33.779
Yep, that's what
we've been asked to do.

14:41.220 --> 14:42.899
What? You know what.

14:42.940 --> 14:46.019
Thomas... Not exactly page one
of the recovery manual, is it?

14:46.059 --> 14:47.259
This wasn't my idea.

14:47.299 --> 14:50.220
No-one goes through what you did
and gets away unscathed.

14:50.259 --> 14:51.860
Not even you, Nikki.
Four days.

14:51.899 --> 14:54.298
If she's alive,
we might not have long.

14:54.299 --> 14:57.100
Look. If it doesn't work out,
we can call it.

14:57.139 --> 15:00.178
All right.
But supportive capacity only.

15:00.179 --> 15:02.739
OK! Baby steps. No postmortems.

15:02.740 --> 15:05.259
I volunteered to go on leave
in the first place.

15:05.299 --> 15:07.700
And if you hadn't, I'd've insisted.

15:10.139 --> 15:11.580
BUZZER

15:13.019 --> 15:14.538
Thanks for seeing us, David.

15:14.539 --> 15:15.820
No problem.

15:17.460 --> 15:19.259
Is there any news?

15:19.299 --> 15:21.100
No. Nothing.

15:22.700 --> 15:25.578
Course, the police are saying
they're not winding down the search,

15:25.580 --> 15:27.178
but I know for a bloody fact

15:27.179 --> 15:29.379
all the lads from Berkshire
were sent home last night.

15:29.419 --> 15:31.059
So what's this about?

15:31.100 --> 15:33.700
Well, we were wondering...

15:33.740 --> 15:37.740
How would you feel about coming to
work at the Lyell for a bit?

15:37.779 --> 15:39.379
Seriously?

15:39.419 --> 15:42.019
Yeah. Truth is,
Nikki's been off for a while

15:42.059 --> 15:44.659
and we've been struggling
with our workload.

15:46.620 --> 15:48.139
You've got a backlog?

15:48.139 --> 15:50.460
I'm about to install
a freezer in my office. Right.

15:53.419 --> 15:54.778
Why me?

15:54.779 --> 15:56.659
Sally said you were the best.

15:58.059 --> 16:00.339
And if you're anything like me,

16:00.340 --> 16:03.500
time on your hands is the last
thing you want right now.

16:05.860 --> 16:08.058
It was just a thought,
so please don't feel like...

16:08.059 --> 16:09.779
Sally said that? About me?

16:11.220 --> 16:13.100
She said you were bloody good.

16:25.259 --> 16:27.859
Ah, Jack. David,
this is Jack Hodgson.

16:27.860 --> 16:29.578
Jack. Good to know you.

16:29.580 --> 16:30.940
How you doing? You all right?

16:30.980 --> 16:33.019
David's going to help us out
for a bit.

16:34.659 --> 16:36.459
Us?

16:36.460 --> 16:38.899
As in... you're back?

16:38.899 --> 16:41.739
He's a colleague of Sally Vaughan's.

16:41.740 --> 16:46.500
Right. How long's it been now?
Hello, stranger.

16:46.539 --> 16:50.418
Clarissa! My goodness,
it's so good to see you. What?

16:50.419 --> 16:51.979
Did she put you up to this?

16:51.980 --> 16:54.058
Hang on, what,
you two know each other?

16:54.059 --> 16:56.179
Hello! David!

16:56.220 --> 16:58.580
Moscow, 2008, the Monarch Hotel.

16:58.620 --> 17:01.259
Seven days.
7,000 Russian criminologists...

17:01.259 --> 17:03.658
You're exaggerating.
..hanging on your every word.

17:03.659 --> 17:06.338
They wanted to learn from the best.
Hello.

17:06.339 --> 17:09.019
Good to see you.
Maybe I should leave you two to it.

17:09.059 --> 17:11.939
Will you show him around?
She can indeed. Let's go.

17:11.940 --> 17:14.058
See you later.
See you in a bit.

17:14.059 --> 17:16.220
Welcome to my world.
Are you having fun here?

17:19.579 --> 17:21.578
Hello, Jack.

17:21.579 --> 17:23.338
Hi.

17:23.339 --> 17:25.220
Good to see you.

17:26.460 --> 17:27.660
Mmm.

17:28.740 --> 17:30.579
I've been trying to call you.

17:32.740 --> 17:33.859
I know.

17:33.900 --> 17:37.538
You got my messages, then? Mm-hmm.

17:37.539 --> 17:38.819
So?

17:40.259 --> 17:43.700
So, uh, it's been full-on since I've
been back, it's just been really...

17:43.740 --> 17:45.180
Full-on? Yeah.

17:49.779 --> 17:51.019
Fair enough.

17:54.460 --> 17:56.900
A few changes, I see.
Yeah. A few.

18:00.140 --> 18:04.940
We don't hear a word, then you show
up with David bloody Cannon in tow.

18:04.980 --> 18:07.778
Is he that bad? No, he's great.

18:07.779 --> 18:09.538
How are you, Nikki?

18:09.539 --> 18:12.138
Yeah. I'm... getting there.

18:12.140 --> 18:14.380
Absolutely getting there.

18:14.420 --> 18:17.420
Right. We've got a job on.

18:35.700 --> 18:39.979
DCI Pete Hollis, DC Heidi Bailey.

18:39.980 --> 18:42.660
Nikki Alexander, David Cannon.
Hi.

18:59.099 --> 19:02.338
Body was found floating face-down
about 20 yards out.

19:02.339 --> 19:03.659
Who found him?

19:03.660 --> 19:05.259
Early fisherman.

19:05.259 --> 19:07.779
Did divers bring the body up here?
Yeah.

19:09.220 --> 19:11.298
We should supervise
a move like that.

19:11.299 --> 19:13.220
Yeah, I needed to get started.

19:13.259 --> 19:15.299
Your Jack squared it with
the crime scene manager.

19:15.339 --> 19:16.740
Yeah. Blame me.

19:17.740 --> 19:19.579
I took lots of pictures.

19:21.220 --> 19:22.500
Thanks.

19:26.579 --> 19:27.900
Over to you.

19:32.619 --> 19:35.940
Got a preliminary ID
from his wallet. Livtar Singh.

19:35.980 --> 19:38.459
Audi in the car park's also
registered to him.

19:38.460 --> 19:39.700
Lovely.

19:42.740 --> 19:43.859
Thank you.

19:45.019 --> 19:46.740
Well...

19:48.339 --> 19:49.858
Looks like he was wearing
a head torch,

19:49.859 --> 19:51.660
the lens of which is broken.

19:54.700 --> 19:56.099
Alcohol.

19:56.140 --> 19:57.380
Yeah. Whisky.

19:57.420 --> 19:59.419
Found it up by the railings.

19:59.420 --> 20:03.019
I can't see him falling over those
railings no matter how drunk he was.

20:03.019 --> 20:05.939
But we can't rule out
that he jumped, can we?

20:05.940 --> 20:07.859
No, we can't.

20:07.900 --> 20:11.979
With a bit of Dutch courage
to help him on his way.

20:11.980 --> 20:13.419
Problem.

20:13.420 --> 20:15.419
Did he smash it in the fall?

20:15.420 --> 20:16.940
Maybe it was already broken.

20:16.980 --> 20:18.900
Then why not leave it in the car?

20:18.940 --> 20:20.700
PHONE RINGTONE: "You Sexy Thing"

20:21.980 --> 20:23.779
Hold that a sec, would you? Cheers.

20:27.859 --> 20:29.859
Hello, mate. You all right?

20:31.059 --> 20:32.500
What do you need?

20:36.579 --> 20:38.618
Oooh, if you'd asked me
three years ago

20:38.619 --> 20:40.819
I could have told you any number
of places.

20:42.700 --> 20:47.058
Erm... the Wheatsheaf
just off the Common.

20:47.059 --> 20:48.740
I better go.

20:48.779 --> 20:51.339
Yep. See you later. Ta-ta.

20:51.380 --> 20:53.619
Bye-bye. Time and place.

21:29.500 --> 21:30.739
Illuminating?

21:30.740 --> 21:34.740
Buckfield Services, 11.32pm.

21:34.779 --> 21:38.299
30 quid's worth of fuel,
bottle of Evian,

21:38.339 --> 21:42.539
two bunches of flowers and a
miscellaneous item priced 3.99.

21:42.579 --> 21:44.140
No whisky? No.

21:46.940 --> 21:48.858
Bottle of Evian's half-drunk.

21:48.859 --> 21:50.500
Where are the flowers?

21:51.700 --> 21:53.740
And who were they for?

22:00.339 --> 22:02.220
Everything OK?

22:02.259 --> 22:05.138
Yeah. Thanks.

22:05.140 --> 22:09.180
No breakfast.
Most important meal of the day.

22:13.859 --> 22:17.058
There's no sign of the whisky
bottle. Could be in his coat.

22:17.059 --> 22:20.220
Yeah, but he's walking steadily.
No indication he's drunk.

22:20.259 --> 22:23.299
Maybe he didn't imbibe
until he reached his spot.

22:25.420 --> 22:27.459
Do you think that...?
I think that

22:27.460 --> 22:30.099
it's always too early
to jump to conclusions.

22:31.740 --> 22:34.740
Sure. OK.

22:36.660 --> 22:39.859
Thing is, I haven't worked on
an actual homicide yet, and...

22:39.900 --> 22:42.180
So you're kind of hoping
that it's murder?

22:42.220 --> 22:43.739
No!

22:43.740 --> 22:46.859
No. Of course not, no. I just...

22:46.900 --> 22:48.578
Mm-hmm.

22:48.579 --> 22:51.140
My advice? Work backwards.

22:51.180 --> 22:52.859
Why was he here?

22:52.900 --> 22:54.419
What did this place mean to him?

22:54.420 --> 22:55.859
Who else knew he came here?

23:00.420 --> 23:04.220
Some kind of grey powder, or silt.

23:04.259 --> 23:08.898
Uh-huh. Yeah, yeah. There's transfer
on the brake and accelerator pedal.

23:08.900 --> 23:10.939
Dried mud in the bag.

23:10.940 --> 23:14.259
Looks like he switched his shoes
for hiking boots...

23:14.299 --> 23:16.900
Why would you change your shoes
and strap a head torch on

23:16.940 --> 23:18.859
if you're about to end it all?

23:24.380 --> 23:26.180
I met Livtar at that reservoir.

23:28.660 --> 23:31.259
We were both sailing instructors.

23:31.299 --> 23:33.500
He was so great with the kids.

23:34.900 --> 23:36.940
I didn't have the patience
back then.

23:40.619 --> 23:43.818
There's no way he'd kill himself.

23:43.819 --> 23:45.220
No way.

23:51.180 --> 23:53.819
We going to need a formal
identification, Emma.

23:57.740 --> 23:58.900
It's him.

24:00.299 --> 24:01.940
Thank you.

24:13.140 --> 24:14.740
This way.

24:16.779 --> 24:18.979
Emma, David. Saw you earlier. Yes.

24:18.980 --> 24:21.380
Can I get you anything?
No, thank you.

24:21.420 --> 24:22.858
Would you like to sit down?

24:22.859 --> 24:24.019
No. I'm fine, thanks.

24:25.900 --> 24:27.099
Thanks.

24:27.140 --> 24:30.339
Emma, we were wondering
if Livtar was much of a drinker.

24:34.220 --> 24:37.898
When we first met, every couple of
months or so he'd get really drunk.

24:37.900 --> 24:41.338
I mean, annihilated, actually.

24:41.339 --> 24:42.699
On what?

24:42.700 --> 24:44.579
Spirits, mostly.

24:45.819 --> 24:48.659
It was like a ritual.

24:48.660 --> 24:50.660
A valve. Something he had to do.

24:52.299 --> 24:53.739
I didn't like it,

24:53.740 --> 24:55.818
so when we got married
he swore he'd stop.

24:55.819 --> 24:56.940
And did he?

25:00.339 --> 25:02.819
Unless you're telling me different?

25:02.859 --> 25:07.338
No, we're not. We haven't reached
any firm conclusions yet.

25:07.339 --> 25:10.980
Victim was wearing this. Something
white embedded in the lens frame.

25:11.019 --> 25:14.459
You want an upgrade on
"something white"? I do.

25:14.460 --> 25:16.900
Hello. DC Bailey.
Good to have Nikki back.

25:18.940 --> 25:20.339
Bit of a surprise.

25:21.500 --> 25:23.098
Yeah. Yeah, for me, too.

25:23.099 --> 25:24.579
You sanctioned it.

25:25.859 --> 25:27.740
For now. Yeah.

25:29.099 --> 25:30.898
How'd you think she seems?

25:30.900 --> 25:34.140
So far, so good - too early to say.

25:34.180 --> 25:35.779
What's David Cannon like?

25:35.819 --> 25:38.459
He's a good laugh.
I don't really know him.

25:38.460 --> 25:41.659
It was one week
nine - ten? - years ago.

25:41.660 --> 25:43.740
Miscellaneous item
on Livtar's receipt.

25:43.779 --> 25:45.299
Let me see.

25:50.220 --> 25:53.059
He was so excited
about becoming a dad.

25:54.539 --> 25:59.539
But when Amy arrived
he just seemed... sad.

25:59.579 --> 26:01.179
Why?

26:01.180 --> 26:04.900
I dunno... it was like
he couldn't enjoy her.

26:11.259 --> 26:12.739
SOBS

26:12.740 --> 26:14.940
Sorry.

26:14.980 --> 26:16.778
Hey, hey, come here.

26:16.779 --> 26:18.220
It's OK, it's OK.

26:27.700 --> 26:30.460
PANTING AND GRUNTING

26:43.259 --> 26:44.819
LIGHTER CLICKS

26:46.859 --> 26:48.298
Gave up.

26:48.299 --> 26:49.900
Yeah?

26:51.539 --> 26:52.979
Since when?

26:52.980 --> 26:54.779
Two years.

26:57.259 --> 26:59.220
That how long it's been?

26:59.259 --> 27:02.259
No. It's been four years.

27:07.420 --> 27:09.338
Sorry.

27:09.339 --> 27:12.420
It's all right. You're a busy woman.

27:19.619 --> 27:21.900
Suspected suicide?

27:23.819 --> 27:25.420
That's what they said.

27:26.299 --> 27:27.700
I don't get it.

27:29.059 --> 27:30.940
He'd just become a father.

27:33.019 --> 27:36.098
Who knows what goes on
in another person's head?

27:36.099 --> 27:38.259
Ain't that the truth.

27:40.900 --> 27:42.339
Do you think it's our fault?

27:43.779 --> 27:45.380
Probably.

27:47.059 --> 27:49.420
Hope the police
didn't find anything untoward.

27:50.980 --> 27:52.339
Like what?

27:54.740 --> 27:56.700
I've no idea.

28:00.019 --> 28:01.299
I've got to go.

28:07.859 --> 28:11.460
Mrs Singh, before Livtar
drove to the reservoir,

28:11.500 --> 28:13.979
he stopped off at a garage
and made some purchases.

28:13.980 --> 28:16.659
Right...? Among other things,
he bought two bunches of flowers

28:16.660 --> 28:18.019
and a teddy bear.

28:18.019 --> 28:20.059
We didn't retrieve these items
from his car.

28:22.059 --> 28:24.140
I can't help you... I'm sorry.

28:24.180 --> 28:27.819
No friends who've just had a baby?
Or a child's birthday?

28:27.859 --> 28:30.659
The journey from the garage
to the reservoir was 30 minutes,

28:30.660 --> 28:33.499
but he didn't get there for an hour.
Now if he stopped off somewhere,

28:33.500 --> 28:36.138
it explains the missing half-hour
and... I'm really sorry -

28:36.140 --> 28:38.180
I need to go home now.
Of course. Just one moment.

28:38.220 --> 28:39.380
Can I have a word? Yeah.

28:41.380 --> 28:43.578
I need you to escort her home.

28:43.579 --> 28:45.579
Sir, no!
I don't want to miss the PM.

28:45.619 --> 28:47.138
There'll be plenty more PMs.

28:47.140 --> 28:50.180
It's the flowers and the toys
we need to explain. So take Jack,

28:50.220 --> 28:52.019
have a nose around,

28:52.019 --> 28:55.058
hoover up any computers, laptops,
phones that you find.

28:55.059 --> 28:57.058
If she asks any questions,
say we're checking

28:57.059 --> 28:59.500
whether Livtar was in financial
difficulties, all right?

28:59.539 --> 29:01.819
All right. Warrant?

29:01.859 --> 29:04.140
It's my next call.

29:12.099 --> 29:13.500
Want to give me a hand?

29:14.579 --> 29:16.500
Excuse me. Sorry.
David?

29:17.980 --> 29:20.619
What is the matter with that guy?

29:21.859 --> 29:24.859
It's OK. Want me to assist?

29:30.380 --> 29:33.819
The rectangular mark on his forehead
is from a head torch.

29:38.099 --> 29:39.539
Camera?

29:41.740 --> 29:44.259
That and the torch's broken lens

29:44.259 --> 29:48.299
suggests he struck something
head-first with force.

29:50.700 --> 29:52.579
Torch is being processed for trace.

29:57.140 --> 30:00.778
There's a champignon de mousse -
foam in his throat, pinkish tinge.

30:00.779 --> 30:02.579
Clear hallmark of drowning.

30:02.619 --> 30:07.140
Lack of oxygen,
myocardial and cerebral anoxia,

30:07.180 --> 30:08.380
death.

30:10.819 --> 30:12.700
SIREN

30:18.099 --> 30:19.138
Hey.

30:19.140 --> 30:21.338
Hey. Sorry.

30:21.339 --> 30:23.339
Sorry. It's OK. What happened?

30:23.380 --> 30:26.779
Just, er, lost it a bit.

30:28.099 --> 30:29.220
Right.

30:32.380 --> 30:36.140
Soon as I saw the body bag,
all I could think of was...

30:36.180 --> 30:38.259
..when we unzipped it...

30:38.259 --> 30:40.939
..it was going to be her inside
and not Livtar Singh.

30:40.940 --> 30:42.500
Sally?

30:43.700 --> 30:45.140
Sorry.

30:47.140 --> 30:48.339
OK.

30:54.460 --> 30:56.499
TV: And now it's time for a news
update.

30:56.500 --> 30:58.939
Police are continuing the hunt
for Sally Vaughan,

30:58.940 --> 31:00.859
who's now been missing
for five days.

31:00.900 --> 31:02.378
At a press conference last night

31:02.380 --> 31:04.699
detectives from
the National Crime Agency

31:04.700 --> 31:07.740
said they were pursuing
a number of active leads

31:07.779 --> 31:10.298
but refused to say
if Dr Vaughan's disappearance

31:10.299 --> 31:13.179
is being linked to her work
as a pathologist.

31:13.180 --> 31:15.140
In other news...

32:20.819 --> 32:22.660
Is that really necessary?

32:25.700 --> 32:27.460
You'll get them all back.

32:33.220 --> 32:36.539
He... He had a shortfall
in the funding.

32:38.259 --> 32:40.420
His dad could've bridged
the gap easily, but...

32:41.940 --> 32:44.940
..Livtar could never
ask for help from anyone,

32:44.980 --> 32:48.619
even though he was the first to
help others. I know the species.

32:50.380 --> 32:51.940
I found it really hard.

32:53.940 --> 32:56.299
When you love someone, you want to
be there for them, right?

32:58.220 --> 32:59.380
Right.

33:02.660 --> 33:05.900
I'll... let you get on.

33:11.779 --> 33:14.618
Thomas. Tox is back on Livtar Singh.

33:14.619 --> 33:16.660
Interesting results.

33:16.700 --> 33:18.900
High levels of alcohol
in his stomach contents,

33:18.940 --> 33:21.420
but almost none in his blood
and urine.

33:23.220 --> 33:25.618
Could he have drowned
before it entered his system?

33:25.619 --> 33:27.858
We'd still expect to find
some alcohol in his urine.

33:27.859 --> 33:30.019
And the fact you didn't...?
Suggests the whisky

33:30.019 --> 33:32.578
was tipped down his throat
after he lost consciousness.

33:32.579 --> 33:34.180
Well, well.

33:34.220 --> 33:35.819
I think someone tried very hard

33:35.859 --> 33:38.619
to make Livtar look like
the author of his own demise.

33:42.460 --> 33:43.900
Thank you, Emma.

34:03.980 --> 34:07.259
Regina vs Henry Drake. Ring a bell?

34:07.259 --> 34:09.420
No. Why would it?

34:09.460 --> 34:12.980
Don't worry. We've got
a resident expert.

34:15.420 --> 34:19.300
18 years ago, I worked
on the Valerie Drake investigation.

34:19.340 --> 34:21.458
It was unusual
because there was no body,

34:21.460 --> 34:24.300
but the police were in no doubt her
husband Henry Drake had killed her.

34:24.340 --> 34:25.739
Why were they so sure?

34:25.739 --> 34:28.018
No other suspects,
plus we found traces of her blood

34:28.059 --> 34:31.219
and fingernails
in the boot of his car. Not enough?

34:31.260 --> 34:33.460
PHONE RINGTONE: You Sexy Thing

34:36.539 --> 34:39.938
No. Drake had money -
and money bought him Morgan Lawson.

34:39.940 --> 34:41.579
The barrister.

34:41.579 --> 34:44.300
He kept drumming home
the same simple mantra.

34:44.340 --> 34:47.539
No body, no case. No body, no case.

34:47.539 --> 34:50.300
Right. Not exactly legal argument,
but it stuck

34:50.340 --> 34:52.539
and Drake was acquitted.
So what happened to him?

34:52.579 --> 34:55.579
Remarried and moved to New Zealand,
where he made a fortune in wine.

34:55.619 --> 34:58.858
Morgan Lawson became one of
the highest-paid barristers

34:58.860 --> 35:00.139
in the country. Karma?

35:00.179 --> 35:01.500
It's a myth.

35:04.139 --> 35:05.860
So what do we think of this note?

35:05.900 --> 35:08.978
It says, "I can make you disappear
and get away with it."

35:08.980 --> 35:11.018
Threat? Maybe.

35:11.019 --> 35:12.458
The Drake case was national news,

35:12.460 --> 35:14.498
doesn't exactly
narrow down the sender.

35:14.500 --> 35:18.300
And I've processed the note -
no prints except Livtar's own.

35:22.500 --> 35:25.980
Excuse me. Just going to
pop out for five minutes.

35:29.739 --> 35:31.139
Excuse me.

35:37.460 --> 35:39.099
Come on, come on...

35:40.460 --> 35:42.099
Bernhardt. It's Nikki.

35:42.099 --> 35:44.659
David just got a text
and walked out of a police briefing.

35:44.659 --> 35:46.059
I need you to keep eyes on him.

35:46.059 --> 35:47.739
Well, I can't. Nikki, please.

35:47.739 --> 35:50.659
He could be going to find Sally.

35:52.099 --> 35:53.900
We might not get another chance.

36:56.139 --> 36:57.739
DOOR CLOSES

CAMERA CLICKS

37:41.019 --> 37:42.739
I've been processing the evidence

37:42.780 --> 37:44.458
you brought back from
the Singh house.

37:44.460 --> 37:48.259
I recovered data from the USB
in Livtar's drawer.

37:48.260 --> 37:50.460
Simplest if I just show you
what's on it.

37:58.300 --> 38:00.018
Who is this woman?

38:00.019 --> 38:02.500
And who was she to Livtar Singh?

38:04.699 --> 38:06.659
Flowers and teddy bears...

38:07.980 --> 38:09.739
Any ideas on location?

38:09.780 --> 38:12.619
Well, I'm working on the shop fronts
visible in the background.

38:12.619 --> 38:13.980
She's pretty.

38:15.260 --> 38:18.739
I've also sourced
the white fragments

38:18.739 --> 38:20.820
embedded in Livtar's head torch.

38:20.860 --> 38:22.818
Barium metaborate.

38:22.820 --> 38:25.259
Anti-rust paint? Yeah.

38:25.260 --> 38:27.460
I assumed it was grit
from the dam wall.

38:27.500 --> 38:30.500
Anything painted white at the scene
he might've run into?

38:31.739 --> 38:34.739
Some missing paint chips consistent
with Livtar's head torch

38:34.739 --> 38:36.418
striking the gate.

38:36.420 --> 38:40.300
Also traces of glass or plastic
on the ground.

38:40.340 --> 38:43.018
From the head torch...?
I'll be pissed off if they're not.

38:43.019 --> 38:45.780
Yeah. I've got to say you've seemed
rather pissed off most of the day.

38:47.179 --> 38:49.179
I should have seen this
the first time.

38:49.219 --> 38:51.179
You've seen it now.
That's the important thing.

38:51.219 --> 38:52.260
It's good.

38:53.460 --> 38:57.099
So he hits the gate face-first
coming from this direction...

38:57.099 --> 38:58.900
So he was heading back to his car.

38:58.940 --> 39:00.579
Running back, given the impact.

39:00.619 --> 39:02.259
And if he was looking round
as he ran,

39:02.260 --> 39:04.659
explains why he didn't see it
until it was too late,

39:04.659 --> 39:06.059
even with a head torch.

39:06.099 --> 39:08.659
Begging the question...
What was he running from?

39:16.500 --> 39:18.619
I told you. I don't know her.

39:18.619 --> 39:20.418
Are you sure, Emma?

39:20.420 --> 39:22.699
Yes, I'm sure.

39:22.739 --> 39:25.539
Look, what am I doing
in a police station?

39:25.539 --> 39:27.780
I'm sorry, Emma. But you
say you don't know this woman.

39:27.820 --> 39:30.778
You say you don't know why Livtar
went off on midnight drives

39:30.780 --> 39:33.019
or why he bought flowers
or teddy bears

39:33.059 --> 39:35.099
or why he drank whisky
back in the day...

39:35.139 --> 39:36.380
What is your point?

39:38.380 --> 39:40.661
I'm just trying to find out
what happened to your husband.

39:45.380 --> 39:47.898
You think this wasn't an accident?

39:47.900 --> 39:50.340
That's why
you're in a police station.

39:56.420 --> 40:00.300
He's right. Huh? It's no big deal
you missed the gate.

40:00.340 --> 40:03.139
Out of character, though.
I was distracted.

40:03.139 --> 40:05.699
That's what I mean.
Out of character.

40:05.699 --> 40:07.179
What do you want, Nikki?

40:07.179 --> 40:09.019
I want to know
why you missed the gate.

40:09.059 --> 40:12.219
I told you. The real reason.
I missed it cos I was thinking,

40:12.260 --> 40:15.298
"Why is Nikki back
when she's so clearly not ready?"

40:15.300 --> 40:18.460
How would you know?
You haven't seen me in months.

40:20.980 --> 40:23.659
Sorry. I don't want an apology.

40:23.699 --> 40:28.139
I just want to understand why.
Why you haven't seen me.

40:28.139 --> 40:29.659
Why do you think?
I don't know!

40:29.699 --> 40:31.940
It's a genuine question...
I was supposed...

40:34.860 --> 40:36.980
I went out there to find you.

40:38.460 --> 40:40.099
To bring you home.

40:40.099 --> 40:41.579
I failed.

40:43.940 --> 40:46.659
Jack... that's nuts.

40:46.699 --> 40:49.298
You're here. I'm here.

40:49.300 --> 40:52.300
We made it. You saved the lives
of... Please stop.

40:57.699 --> 41:00.460
Jack, you've got nothing to prove.

41:01.659 --> 41:03.059
Nothing.

41:04.659 --> 41:06.300
Get a room!

41:08.460 --> 41:09.739
Check this out.

41:19.539 --> 41:22.340
So, came through here.

41:22.380 --> 41:25.898
Got various broken branches,
got trampled ground.

41:25.900 --> 41:29.260
That gave me a reverse path
round to...

41:30.780 --> 41:31.900
..this.

41:33.539 --> 41:35.860
I didn't bag it, cos, well,
that's your bag.

41:35.900 --> 41:37.539
You're on fire, David.

41:40.260 --> 41:44.059
So you say there was a problem with
the contractors. Anything specific?

41:44.059 --> 41:45.938
Not really.

41:45.940 --> 41:49.179
But they knew he had a launch
date that he needed to hit

41:49.219 --> 41:50.780
and they dragged their heels.

41:52.820 --> 41:54.858
At the fundraiser
I had to leave early

41:54.860 --> 41:57.458
to take my daughter
to an appointment.

41:57.460 --> 41:59.778
I went to say goodbye to Livtar
and I found him

41:59.780 --> 42:03.019
in the spa with this man
who was obviously giving him grief.

42:04.900 --> 42:07.019
Do you know what about?

42:07.059 --> 42:09.139
Money, I think.

42:11.099 --> 42:13.059
Anyway, the guy was dodgy.

42:13.099 --> 42:14.659
As soon as he saw me coming

42:14.659 --> 42:17.579
he picked up some plans
that were lying around.

42:17.579 --> 42:19.699
But it was bullshit.

42:19.739 --> 42:21.820
He was holding them upside down.

42:21.860 --> 42:25.938
He said something like,
"It's one thing asking for money

42:25.940 --> 42:29.179
"for yourself, but asking for it
for her is something else."

42:30.699 --> 42:32.420
I know it doesn't make any sense.

42:32.460 --> 42:33.860
Who was the her?

42:36.059 --> 42:37.298
I don't know.

42:37.300 --> 42:39.380
And you didn't ask Livtar about it?

42:40.980 --> 42:42.780
I never got a chance.

42:45.460 --> 42:47.900
OK. Will do. Thanks, Heidi.

42:49.460 --> 42:52.340
Where's Jack?
Went back to the reservoir.

42:54.179 --> 42:56.179
Why?

42:56.179 --> 42:58.820
Thinks he might've missed something.
And did he?

43:00.659 --> 43:02.059
What are you after?

43:02.059 --> 43:03.978
Clarissa...

43:03.980 --> 43:07.579
I think he was a bit thrown
by Nikki coming back.

43:07.579 --> 43:11.099
Sally Vaughan must be
dragging it all up for her.

43:12.860 --> 43:14.659
What did you need Jack for?

43:14.699 --> 43:16.898
Secure some plans
from Livtar's club,

43:16.900 --> 43:20.778
see if we can lift fingerprints.
OK. I can do that.

43:20.780 --> 43:23.420
Right. Good.

43:24.659 --> 43:26.659
Go carefully -
it's still a building site.

43:29.699 --> 43:32.739
Good day's work. Fancy a beer later?

43:32.739 --> 43:35.338
Nice offer, but... knackered.

43:35.340 --> 43:39.219
OK, raincheck? Raincheck. Raincheck.

PHONE VIBRATES

43:48.820 --> 43:50.019
Hello?

43:50.059 --> 43:52.860
Sally's phone just came back online
for 30 seconds.

43:52.900 --> 43:55.460
You're kidding!
Is David Cannon with you?

43:56.980 --> 43:58.500
Yes.

43:58.539 --> 44:00.978
The phone pinged a mast
in North Kent.

44:00.980 --> 44:04.420
One mast means no exact location,
but Cannon's definitely with you?

44:04.460 --> 44:07.059
Yes. Great. Thanks, Nikki.

44:11.380 --> 44:13.018
Just the one, then.

44:13.019 --> 44:14.619
Yeah.

45:09.699 --> 45:11.659
Can I help you with something?

45:11.699 --> 45:14.099
You do know
you're on private property?

45:19.619 --> 45:21.019
Excuse me.

45:35.659 --> 45:39.900
OK, so we've traced the signal
from Sally's phone to a farm.

45:44.179 --> 45:47.019
Angus Merrick.
Why do I know that name?

45:49.260 --> 45:50.460
Shit.

45:50.500 --> 45:52.340
He's not going to come quietly.

45:53.980 --> 45:57.380
Mobilise Firearms, be discreet.
Sir.

46:00.780 --> 46:03.018
Well, it's really good of
you to help us out, David.

46:03.019 --> 46:05.699
Don't be daft. You're helping me.

46:05.699 --> 46:07.340
I was worried about you earlier.

46:08.780 --> 46:11.219
Why? You disappeared again.

46:11.219 --> 46:12.219
Did I?

46:13.900 --> 46:17.780
Yeah, yeah, I went to see...
Gwen Blair. Our lab technician.

46:17.820 --> 46:21.179
I thought maybe she'd have
some news about Sally. Did she?

46:26.860 --> 46:30.099
Did you and Sally see each other
much outside of work?

46:30.099 --> 46:31.699
No. Not lately.

46:31.739 --> 46:34.139
Used to. When I got divorced...

46:34.179 --> 46:36.179
She's a bloody good listener.

46:36.219 --> 46:38.418
Yeah, she is.

46:38.420 --> 46:40.099
Can I tell you something?

46:40.139 --> 46:41.619
In confidence.

46:41.659 --> 46:43.219
Sure.

46:44.739 --> 46:47.179
When I last saw Sally...

46:47.179 --> 46:48.778
..we argued.

46:48.780 --> 46:50.579
Right.

46:52.420 --> 46:54.340
Well, Jack and I fight sometimes.

46:54.380 --> 46:57.059
No, I mean a proper, full-on,
stand-up row.

46:57.099 --> 46:58.500
About what?

46:58.539 --> 47:01.380
About the lab. You know
she was selling the lab.

47:03.099 --> 47:05.219
And I wanted her to make it over
to me.

47:05.260 --> 47:06.539
She'd be a sleeping partner.

47:06.579 --> 47:08.298
She could keep her hand in
if she wanted...

47:08.300 --> 47:10.500
That doesn't sound like
a terrible idea. No, it wasn't.

47:10.539 --> 47:12.139
She thought it was.

47:12.139 --> 47:14.139
And that's what you rowed about?

47:14.179 --> 47:15.938
Yeah. We made the lab together.

47:15.940 --> 47:18.219
You know, I did everything to
help her with it.

47:18.219 --> 47:20.659
But she owned it all on paper.
Every brick.

47:20.699 --> 47:22.898
She could be stubborn.

47:22.900 --> 47:25.460
Yeah. So can I, believe me.

47:26.980 --> 47:28.778
I should've let it drop.

47:28.780 --> 47:31.019
I didn't have the right.
Did you tell the police?

47:32.900 --> 47:34.018
Of course.

47:34.019 --> 47:36.539
And they said the same -
I shouldn't beat myself up about it.

47:38.460 --> 47:40.579
I'm going to nip to the loo.
Excuse me.

Hello? Hi, Nikki, it's Bernhardt.

48:24.539 --> 48:27.139
Listen. The woman
that Cannon met earlier -

48:27.139 --> 48:29.699
she gave him a map
of Sally's village.

48:29.699 --> 48:32.498
We traced her phone to
a farm in Kent.

48:32.500 --> 48:34.978
Angus Merrick - ring any bells?

48:34.980 --> 48:36.380
No.

48:36.420 --> 48:39.659
His brother Craig was killed in a
high-speed police chase last year.

48:39.699 --> 48:42.099
Angus blamed them
and then didn't want a pathologist

48:42.099 --> 48:44.778
adding insult to injury
by cutting up his brother.

48:44.780 --> 48:46.579
Sally did the postmortem?

48:46.619 --> 48:49.300
Sorry, I'm going to have to go.
I'll call you back.

48:49.340 --> 48:50.820
Thanks. Bye.

48:50.860 --> 48:51.938
Everything OK?

48:51.940 --> 48:54.780
Yeah. Sorry, where were we?

Hello, mate. All right?
What brings you here?

49:47.980 --> 49:51.139
Fancy a couple of rounds yourself?

49:51.139 --> 49:53.219
I've got a slot Friday night.

49:56.260 --> 49:57.699
Yeah. Why not?

50:17.380 --> 50:19.219
Angus Merrick!

50:55.780 --> 50:57.818
We just want to talk, Angus.

50:57.820 --> 51:00.860
Yeah - like you wanted to
talk to my brother!

51:02.900 --> 51:05.059
We need to know Sally's safe.

51:05.059 --> 51:07.019
I don't know any Sally!

51:07.059 --> 51:09.980
That's not true, is it, Angus?

51:10.019 --> 51:11.579
SHOTGUN BLAST

51:11.619 --> 51:12.860
GUNSHOT

51:14.059 --> 51:15.259
Go, go, go!

51:15.260 --> 51:16.420
Call Sally's mobile.

51:23.500 --> 51:25.019
PHONE RINGING

52:42.420 --> 52:43.900
TYPING

53:03.380 --> 53:04.860
PHONE VIBRATING

53:09.820 --> 53:11.780
Hello? Hi, Nikki, it's Bernhardt.

53:11.820 --> 53:13.699
Have you found her?
No, but we've got him.

53:13.739 --> 53:14.938
How do you know it's him?

53:14.940 --> 53:17.980
Merrick had her phone.
Blood on the screen matches Sally's.

53:19.139 --> 53:20.179
Christ.

53:21.420 --> 53:24.500
David Cannon
was a blind alley - sorry.

53:37.539 --> 53:40.699
I've ID'd the man
Emma saw arguing with Livtar.

53:40.739 --> 53:43.739
Gary Hadlow -
loan shark and bouncer.

53:43.739 --> 53:46.219
He was at the club yesterday -
I saw him.

53:46.219 --> 53:48.420
What were you doing there?
My job.

53:48.460 --> 53:51.260
Why were his prints on file?
He has form for GBH.

53:51.300 --> 53:54.460
I've been over Livtar's
phone records -

53:54.500 --> 53:58.539
there's calls to and from Hadlow's
mobile in the past month.

53:58.579 --> 54:00.380
Loan shark?

54:00.420 --> 54:03.579
We know Livtar had some issues
with some contractors.

54:03.619 --> 54:05.699
Sir, we should bring Hadlow in now.

54:05.739 --> 54:08.619
And hit him with what?
Making phone calls?

54:08.659 --> 54:11.179
We can't even place him
at the reservoir.

54:11.219 --> 54:13.059
No - but somebody
breached that fence.

54:13.059 --> 54:17.458
This snagged material contains
neoprene, a synthetic rubber.

54:17.460 --> 54:21.340
Neoprene finger ridges are found
in army tactical gloves.

54:21.380 --> 54:24.418
It was a good find.
David's find. I just ran it.

54:24.420 --> 54:27.219
Don't... don't we need to focus
on the gap between

54:27.260 --> 54:30.260
Livtar leaving the service station
and getting to the reservoir?

54:30.300 --> 54:32.300
Where did he go
in that half an hour?

54:32.340 --> 54:34.858
What did he do with the flowers
and the toy?

54:34.860 --> 54:36.539
We might have a few ideas
about that.

54:36.579 --> 54:40.018
Clarissa looked at the grey powder
on the bottom of Livtar's shoes.

54:40.019 --> 54:42.739
It's significantly degraded
amorphous carbon.

54:42.739 --> 54:44.699
Ash, basically.

54:44.739 --> 54:46.338
Would you do me the honours?

54:46.340 --> 54:49.219
Given the limits of where Livtar
could've gone in 30 minutes,

54:49.219 --> 54:51.378
we have a best guess.

54:51.380 --> 54:54.659
Yeah, it's the globe, isn't it?
Yeah. Here you go.

54:54.699 --> 54:58.659
Maitland Salt Factory, which
burned to the ground in '85.

55:55.780 --> 55:57.420
Necklace is quite distinctive.

56:00.500 --> 56:02.420
Might help with the ID.

56:05.940 --> 56:07.380
Look at that.

56:09.340 --> 56:11.458
CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS

56:11.460 --> 56:13.260
Any idea how long we're talking?

56:15.099 --> 56:16.579
Ten years? Maybe more.

56:19.179 --> 56:21.219
Livtar knew where they were buried.

56:25.659 --> 56:27.019
Look at this.
