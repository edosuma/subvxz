<i> In the criminal justice system</i>

<i> Un fuego..!</i>

01:01.195 --> 01:02.528
Get across the street.

01:02.530 --> 01:04.263
Move it!

01:04.265 --> 01:10.169
We got your two and
a half-inch line over here!

01:10.171 --> 01:16.341
(<i> fireman radioing location</i>

01:18.412 --> 01:20.579
Okay! Go! Go! Go!

01:20.581 --> 01:24.283

01:33.594 --> 01:38.697
(<i> unclear radio transmissions</i> )

01:38.699 --> 01:41.433
Ready in here!

01:41.435 --> 01:44.403
You going to put
the fire out yourself?

01:44.405 --> 01:46.872
Every kid wants
to be a fireman.

01:46.874 --> 01:48.140
Or a cop.

01:48.142 --> 01:49.658
Not me.
No?

01:49.659 --> 01:51.175
When I saw my old man,
which was, like,

01:51.178 --> 01:52.277
every Sunday morning
at mass,

01:52.279 --> 01:53.345
I swore I'd do
something different.

01:53.347 --> 01:54.346
What happened?

01:54.348 --> 01:55.714
I grew up, I gues...

01:58.652 --> 02:01.153
God help us.

02:05.693 --> 02:08.260
Oh, my God.

03:59.940 --> 04:01.840
I've never seen
this many.

04:01.842 --> 04:03.575
You?

04:03.577 --> 04:06.845
Not in civilian life.

04:06.847 --> 04:10.882
God knows how many
are still up in there.

04:13.454 --> 04:14.953
What was this place?

04:14.955 --> 04:17.289
A social club.

04:17.291 --> 04:19.391
Social?

04:36.277 --> 04:38.043
MAN:
coming out.her one

04:40.948 --> 04:43.315
Sorry, fellows,
can't let you in just yet.

04:43.317 --> 04:44.449
We got tickets.

04:44.451 --> 04:46.985
Hey, this isn't
a dick contest, buddy.

04:46.987 --> 04:48.520
You're saying
it's arson?

04:48.522 --> 04:51.456
Somebody laid the propellant
between 1:00, 1:15.

04:51.458 --> 04:53.659
The whole thing
took two, three minutes.

04:53.661 --> 04:54.926
It's arson.

04:54.928 --> 04:57.329
Then forego
the waiting period.

04:57.331 --> 05:01.300
No, we got to make sure
there are no hot spots.

05:01.302 --> 05:02.334
And no evidence!

05:02.336 --> 05:04.503
Look,
we got the burn pattern

05:04.505 --> 05:06.371
and a piece
of the device.

05:06.373 --> 05:08.507
You go
running up

05:08.508 --> 05:10.642
fall through the ceiling--
what good does that do?

05:10.644 --> 05:12.010
Call me impulsive.

05:12.012 --> 05:14.413
Monahan. Arson.

05:16.450 --> 05:18.750
CRAGEN:
And the death count?

05:18.752 --> 05:21.320
We got, what-- 51, mike?

05:21.322 --> 05:22.487
Fifty-two.

05:22.489 --> 05:24.273
The club was
on the second floor,

05:24.274 --> 05:26.058
the guy torched it
from the bottom of the stairs.

05:26.060 --> 05:28.026
It was like, whoosh,
right up the chimmney.

05:28.028 --> 05:30.595
Anybody up above
would have been blinded.

05:30.597 --> 05:34.032
This guy picked a moment
when nobody was outside.

05:34.034 --> 05:35.634
Or nobody
remembers anything.

05:35.636 --> 05:36.935
Oh, yeah? Why's that?

05:36.937 --> 05:39.438
It's one of those
social clubs

05:39.440 --> 05:41.773
for Central Americans--
Honduras, El Salvador.

05:41.775 --> 05:43.775
They don't have
enough heartache

05:43.777 --> 05:45.377
in their own country?

05:45.379 --> 05:46.511
They're here illegally.

05:46.513 --> 05:48.513
They see an authority figure

05:48.515 --> 05:50.782
they shut their mouths fast.

05:50.784 --> 05:52.084
CRAGEN:
Well, this club...

05:52.086 --> 05:54.052
LOGAN:
<i> El Cielo.</i>

05:54.054 --> 05:55.987
"Heaven."

05:55.989 --> 05:57.556
Heaven.

05:57.558 --> 05:59.958
Okay, assuming
that this is arson

05:59.960 --> 06:03.028
do we have any idea
who the owner is?

06:03.030 --> 06:07.065
These places change owners
like you change your socks.

06:07.067 --> 06:08.767
Hall of records opens
in one hour.

06:08.769 --> 06:09.801
It's Sunday, Mike.

06:09.803 --> 06:11.370
Maybe you ought to just...

06:11.372 --> 06:12.504
I don't care.

06:12.506 --> 06:13.638
I can't sleep.

06:13.640 --> 06:15.073
Let's get on it.

06:15.075 --> 06:17.376
We'll check the hospital,
check for survivors.

06:17.378 --> 06:20.045
Maybe somebody
will get over their problem

06:20.047 --> 06:21.680
with authority figures.

06:25.052 --> 06:27.052
Is this
the complete list?

06:27.054 --> 06:28.153
So far.

06:28.155 --> 06:30.021
We've got the first 20.

06:30.023 --> 06:33.425
The rest are at Mount Sinai
and Saint John's.

06:34.828 --> 06:37.629
Pinero, Rojas,
Santiago, Segre...

06:37.631 --> 06:40.098
Have you sorted out
any of these people?

06:40.100 --> 06:41.400
They're the lucky ones.

06:41.402 --> 06:43.402
Yeah, I know.
You talked to them.

06:43.404 --> 06:45.070
Did they all work there?

06:45.072 --> 06:47.472
Were any of them customers?

06:47.474 --> 06:49.641
I think the manager...

06:49.643 --> 06:51.009
Yeah. Acosta, Gilberto.

06:51.011 --> 06:53.578
He's being prepped
for surgery.

06:53.580 --> 06:55.514
Better hurry.

06:57.818 --> 06:59.718
CERRETA:
Mr. Acosta.

06:59.720 --> 07:03.488
The man you had
to throw out of the club

07:03.490 --> 07:04.756
the troublemaker--

07:04.758 --> 07:06.625
what is his name?

07:06.627 --> 07:10.929
(<i> Strained whispering</i> )

07:14.768 --> 07:17.703
Guillermo something.

07:17.704 --> 07:20.639
His girlfriend's the barmaid,
Celia Montalbano.

07:20.641 --> 07:22.641
So this was
a lovers' quarrel?

07:22.643 --> 07:26.812
(<i> whispering</i> )

07:31.118 --> 07:33.685
He says the guy's a drunk.

07:33.687 --> 07:35.153
Bouncer throws him out.

07:35.155 --> 07:38.490
He threatens to come back
and wipe everybody out.

07:38.492 --> 07:42.494
Mr. Acosta,
what is your bouncer's name?

07:42.496 --> 07:44.763
NURSE:
Guys... come on.

07:44.765 --> 07:47.632
Now, the man
can hardly breathe.

07:47.634 --> 07:49.768
Pedro Cruz.

07:49.770 --> 07:50.902
Thank you, sir.

07:50.904 --> 07:52.804
Thank you.

07:58.078 --> 08:01.079
Pedro cruz is...

08:01.081 --> 08:02.180
not so lucky.

08:02.182 --> 08:04.850
D.O.A., Saint John's.

08:04.852 --> 08:07.586
What about that barmaid,
Celia something?

08:07.588 --> 08:08.753
Celia, Celia, Celia...

08:08.755 --> 08:10.789
Montalbano.

08:10.791 --> 08:12.858
Montalbano.

08:15.095 --> 08:18.597
Released Mount Sinai,
7:00 a.m.

08:18.599 --> 08:20.499
Thanks.

08:21.935 --> 08:23.568
By the way, you were great.

08:23.570 --> 08:25.270
Listen, you know
how gunshot vics act?

08:25.272 --> 08:27.706
You mean, "patchme up
before the pigs get here"?

08:27.708 --> 08:30.208
Anybody with a bad burn
acting like that...

08:30.210 --> 08:31.543
A.S.A.P., Detective.

08:31.545 --> 08:32.911
I owe you.

08:36.116 --> 08:37.282
Celia Montalbano?

08:37.284 --> 08:38.850
<i> Si.</i>

08:38.852 --> 08:40.552
<i> ¿Usted hable ingles?</i>

08:40.554 --> 08:42.754
I've been here seven years.

08:42.756 --> 08:45.223
Listen, we understand
you have a boyfriend.

08:45.225 --> 08:46.658
No.

08:46.660 --> 08:48.660
I don't have a boyfriend.

08:48.662 --> 08:52.264
WOMAN:
<i> No hables</i>
<i> con esa gente.</i>

08:52.266 --> 08:54.266
CELIA:
<i> Esta bien, esta bien.</i>

08:54.268 --> 08:56.134
<i>Esta bien, mama,</i>
<i>le dije.</i>

08:56.136 --> 08:58.937
A man named Guillermo,
we're told that you and he...

08:58.939 --> 09:00.272
He's a pig.

09:00.274 --> 09:02.240
<i> Un borrachon.</i>

09:02.242 --> 09:05.544
I told him to stop pestering me.

09:05.546 --> 09:07.145
We her that
he's in love with you.

09:07.147 --> 09:09.147
I can't help that.

09:09.149 --> 09:11.550
LOGAN:
Let me tell you
something.

09:11.552 --> 09:14.252
Word gets around
that he torched that club

09:14.254 --> 09:16.888
there's gonna be a lot
of people looking for him.

09:16.890 --> 09:18.290
Not just us.
You understand me?

09:18.292 --> 09:21.960
You're saying
that Guillermo did that?

09:24.164 --> 09:26.731
He's crazy,
you know?

09:26.733 --> 09:29.601
But he's not that bad.

09:29.603 --> 09:31.269
Maybe you're right

09:31.271 --> 09:34.873
but I'll need his address,
okay?

09:34.875 --> 09:37.275
I haven't been out.

09:37.277 --> 09:39.010
No television,
Guillermo?

09:39.012 --> 09:40.278
No radio?

09:40.280 --> 09:43.348
All right then,
we'll break the news.

09:43.350 --> 09:46.017
Last night
somebody torched<i> El Cielo</i>

09:46.019 --> 09:49.321
and at least 50
of your people died.

09:52.826 --> 09:55.226
Doesn't that mean anything
to you, man?

09:57.197 --> 09:59.598
Give him back
his medicine

09:59.600 --> 10:01.833
maybe it will help his memory.

10:07.040 --> 10:08.807
Listen.

10:08.809 --> 10:12.377
You made a big stink
last night around 11:00 p.m.

10:12.379 --> 10:14.980
What did you do after that?

10:17.684 --> 10:18.917
<i> No se.</i>

10:18.919 --> 10:21.653
<i> No se?</i>

10:21.655 --> 10:23.922
Or won't say?

10:23.924 --> 10:25.757
All right, let's go.

10:29.329 --> 10:31.396
Where were you
all that time?

10:31.398 --> 10:32.998
I don't know.

10:33.000 --> 10:37.002
Come on, Ruiz--
think, think.

10:37.004 --> 10:39.704
I don't know.

10:39.706 --> 10:41.740
We got traces
of gasoline--

10:41.742 --> 10:43.875
regular
unleaded.

10:43.877 --> 10:45.010
Really.

10:45.012 --> 10:46.845
What brand?

10:46.847 --> 10:48.980
We can't get it
that close

10:48.982 --> 10:50.982
but I know
how he did it.

10:50.984 --> 10:54.319
It's the old gas-can-
in-the-trouser trick

10:54.321 --> 10:55.954
or in this case

10:55.956 --> 10:58.356
the thing that holds
windshield-wiper fluid.

10:58.358 --> 11:00.825
I don't...
i don't really follow.

11:00.827 --> 11:01.993
Well, it's simple.

11:01.995 --> 11:04.329
You run a tube
down your leg.

11:04.331 --> 11:06.398
Nobody sees
a thing until...

11:06.400 --> 11:09.267
and we're off
to the races.

11:09.269 --> 11:10.969
This is a common MO?

11:10.971 --> 11:12.704
Among your
card-carrying

11:12.706 --> 11:14.272
professional
arsonists, yeah.

11:14.274 --> 11:17.075
I mean, it's simple,
but it's tricky.

11:17.077 --> 11:19.844
You got a container
of gasoline

11:19.846 --> 11:22.313
strapped down there
between your legs.

11:22.315 --> 11:24.416
I mean, one false move--

11:24.418 --> 11:26.851
it's bye-bye
future generation.

11:26.853 --> 11:29.020
Well, our Mr. Ruiz here

11:29.022 --> 11:33.291
does not strike me
as that smart or that lucky.

11:33.293 --> 11:35.760
He doesn't look
like he could

11:35.762 --> 11:39.364
burn his way
out of a paper bag.

11:52.012 --> 11:53.411
Fellows,
Patrick thinks

11:53.413 --> 11:55.747
we're barking
up the wrong tree

11:55.749 --> 11:58.349
with the jealous boyfriend idea.

11:58.351 --> 12:01.953
First the crime scene
was too hot to visit.

12:01.955 --> 12:03.455
Now you've got him

12:03.457 --> 12:04.856
all sussed out?

12:04.858 --> 12:05.990
MONAHAN:
We found this

12:05.992 --> 12:08.026
at the foot
of the stairs.

12:08.028 --> 12:09.127
New variation

12:09.129 --> 12:11.429
on an old arsonist's
trick.

12:11.431 --> 12:13.765
Look,
the guy's a firebug

12:13.767 --> 12:15.133
not a brain surgeon.

12:15.135 --> 12:17.285
Phil?

12:17.286 --> 12:19.436
Ruiz claims to be missing
a crucial period of time.

12:19.439 --> 12:23.074
Maybe he<i> was</i> in a blackout.

12:23.076 --> 12:25.110
I still can't imagine this guy

12:25.112 --> 12:27.779
wanting to kill
all those people.

12:27.781 --> 12:30.749
Well, that might be the guy,
fellows.

12:30.751 --> 12:32.050
I'm just saying

12:32.052 --> 12:33.451
if I were you

12:33.453 --> 12:35.920
I would start
with arson for profit

12:35.922 --> 12:37.422
and follow the money.

12:37.424 --> 12:39.157
You got a fix on the owner?

12:39.159 --> 12:40.792
Yeah, Jose Rivera.

12:40.794 --> 12:42.026
Check him out

12:42.028 --> 12:43.995
after you take
Mr. Ruiz home.

12:43.997 --> 12:46.397
Maybe something
will come back to him.

12:46.399 --> 12:50.135
Tomorrow the D.A.'s office
is holding a press conference.

12:50.137 --> 12:52.070
I would really like

12:52.072 --> 12:54.839

13:19.099 --> 13:20.665
Last night, sir

13:20.666 --> 13:22.232
did you let Mr. Ruiz
into the apartment?

13:22.235 --> 13:24.969
He said
he lost his keys again.

13:24.971 --> 13:28.907
Next time sleep it off
on the street,<i> estupido.</i>

13:28.909 --> 13:30.074
When was that?

13:30.076 --> 13:32.410
About 11:30--
the news was ending.

13:32.412 --> 13:36.114
Do you know if Mr. Ruiz
went out again?

13:36.116 --> 13:39.851
No way. That<i> borrachon</i>
was dead to the world.

13:39.853 --> 13:41.920

Ah, well.

13:45.492 --> 13:48.993

14:06.980 --> 14:08.479
Mr. Rivera.

14:10.517 --> 14:11.616

14:11.618 --> 14:13.518
You don't seem surprised.

14:13.520 --> 14:16.554
CERRETA:
Doesn't seem like
much of a building

14:16.556 --> 14:18.590

this building.

14:21.094 --> 14:22.560
No?

14:22.561 --> 14:24.027
Just the chairs
and tables.

14:24.030 --> 14:27.065
A new P.A. system
just last week.

14:27.067 --> 14:29.033
I'm sure they're all covered.

14:29.035 --> 14:31.002
I don't have insurance.

14:31.004 --> 14:33.872
Can't get insurance
without papers.

14:33.874 --> 14:37.542
You don't own it,
who does?

14:37.544 --> 14:39.510
<i> Cubano</i> named marcos.

14:39.512 --> 14:42.480
I begged him
to put in sprinklers

14:42.482 --> 14:44.482
but he was too cheap.

14:44.484 --> 14:46.084
You're such a safety nut

14:46.086 --> 14:49.087
how come you padlock
the only exit door?

14:49.089 --> 14:51.122
They were always
like that.

14:51.124 --> 14:53.008
I don't suppose

14:53.009 --> 14:54.893
it was to keep people
from sneaking in?

14:54.895 --> 14:58.296
I lost my only daughter
in there, mister

14:58.298 --> 15:00.899
and three of my cousins.

15:00.901 --> 15:03.501

15:18.151 --> 15:20.084
Take the circus outside.

15:20.086 --> 15:22.053
They're here

15:22.055 --> 15:24.088
No comment,

15:24.090 --> 15:25.189
It will save trees.

15:25.191 --> 15:27.625
The whole town's

15:27.627 --> 15:29.560
Everybody's feeling
righteous indignation

15:29.562 --> 15:31.963
over the tragic loss
of a lot of people

15:31.965 --> 15:35.199
they wouldn't ordinarily
have the time of day for.

15:35.201 --> 15:36.301
A bit cynical.

15:36.303 --> 15:37.936
Is that right, Paul?

15:37.938 --> 15:39.938
You're here
with the D.A.'S press liaison.

15:39.940 --> 15:41.506
We don't have a suspect
or an eyewitness.

15:41.508 --> 15:44.142
The only physical evidence
we<i> do</i> have

15:44.144 --> 15:45.343
we are not releasing.

15:45.345 --> 15:48.079
The melted windshield
cleaner gizmo?

15:48.081 --> 15:51.182
And you heard that where?

15:51.184 --> 15:52.183
Sources.

15:52.185 --> 15:54.619
You got half
the city commissioners

15:54.621 --> 15:58.156
scrambling to reassess
the licensing practices of...

15:58.158 --> 16:01.192
And scrambling
to cover their own asses

16:01.194 --> 16:03.194

16:05.098 --> 16:08.099
As soon as I have something,
Katrina, okay?

16:08.101 --> 16:09.367
What about you?

16:09.369 --> 16:11.102
Remember the rap?

16:11.104 --> 16:12.370
"The city deplores

16:12.372 --> 16:15.106

16:15.108 --> 16:18.076
You give good sound bite,
Paul.

16:23.650 --> 16:25.383
Bunch of shell corporations.

16:25.385 --> 16:28.386
Bottom line-- the real
owner is named Marcos.

16:28.388 --> 16:31.656
The<i> Voice</i> named him
slumlord of the year in '87.

16:31.658 --> 16:32.657
Hang on, please.

16:32.659 --> 16:33.725
And?

16:33.727 --> 16:35.126
He's even done time

16:35.128 --> 16:36.995
for safety code
violations.

16:36.997 --> 16:38.129
He's that bad.

16:38.131 --> 16:39.664
Excellent.

16:41.601 --> 16:46.137
What time does your boss
usually get in?

16:53.213 --> 16:55.780
It's important
we speak to him.

16:55.782 --> 16:58.750
Has he called in
for messages?

16:58.752 --> 17:01.753
Have you called Mr. Marcos
at home?

17:03.256 --> 17:05.123
Okay,
give us his address.

17:05.125 --> 17:07.392
We'll go there
ourselves.

17:07.394 --> 17:09.627

17:27.414 --> 17:29.280
He no come home last night.

17:29.282 --> 17:31.282
Is Mrs. Marcos in?

17:31.284 --> 17:33.151
She down in the morgue.

17:33.153 --> 17:34.419
In the what?

17:34.421 --> 17:35.686
The morgue.

17:35.688 --> 17:37.688
She down in the morgue.

17:37.690 --> 17:39.157
Oh, brother.

17:40.126 --> 17:42.060
Thank you.

17:44.230 --> 17:45.797
Yeah, I understand.

And please tell his honor

17:47.667 --> 17:51.135

the overtime paperwork

17:51.137 --> 17:52.270

17:52.272 --> 17:54.205
Oh, no, thank<i> you.</i>

17:55.642 --> 17:57.075
Well?

17:57.077 --> 17:59.844
The coroner's office
confirmed Marcos's death

17:59.846 --> 18:01.145
at 10:21 this morning.

18:01.147 --> 18:02.280
Smoke inhalation.

18:02.282 --> 18:04.148
That shoots
arson for profit.

What is less than square one?

18:06.152 --> 18:09.187
Minus zippo? Negative<i> bupkis?</i>

18:09.189 --> 18:11.222
Oh, please, God.

18:11.224 --> 18:13.324
That head nurse
says some guy came in

18:13.326 --> 18:15.827
<i>begging</i> them
to take care of his leg.

18:15.829 --> 18:18.196
Some kind of a wound
<i>plus</i> a second-degree burn.

18:18.198 --> 18:21.232
He took off,
but they got photos.

18:21.234 --> 18:22.133
X-rays?

18:22.135 --> 18:23.167
Yep.

18:23.169 --> 18:24.869

Plastic, maybe.

18:37.417 --> 18:39.383
Dr. Mendel wanted to remove it

18:39.385 --> 18:43.387
but the patient apparently
had a big day in front of him.

18:43.389 --> 18:45.289
I bet.

18:45.291 --> 18:49.160
We gave him cortisone
and a cold compress for his leg

18:49.162 --> 18:51.496
and then he took off...
limped off, actually.

18:51.498 --> 18:53.531

in his right thigh.

18:53.533 --> 18:56.400
Please, tell me
you have paperwork on him.

18:56.402 --> 18:57.535
He paid cash

18:57.537 --> 19:00.204
but he showed us
his green card.

19:00.206 --> 19:03.207
Made a big deal of it,
actually.

19:03.209 --> 19:05.276

You're the best.

There is nothing wrong
with my legs.

I'm modest.

Is that a crime?

Drop your pants
and we're out of here, okay?

19:30.236 --> 19:32.303
Let's go. Drop them.

Nope.

Couple of weeks ago

a junkie broke
into my place.

my green card.

Some junkie's got
your green card?

Yeah. It cost me five grand

20:00.833 --> 20:03.301
plus three years
of running around.

20:03.303 --> 20:05.269
I wanted to break his face

20:05.271 --> 20:08.239
but he started crying
that he didn't have anything

20:08.241 --> 20:10.775
plus he already shoot it
in his arms.

He needed
medical treatment.

No green card, no hospital.

23:54.600 --> 23:57.568
The guy is here
illegally.

23:57.570 --> 24:00.438
The constitution
applies to everyone

24:00.440 --> 24:02.740
including illegals.

24:02.742 --> 24:05.509
This says you get
to cut my leg open.

24:05.511 --> 24:07.478
No, that's
a consent form.

24:07.480 --> 24:09.980
It says you agree
to let us remove

24:09.982 --> 24:12.850
whatever is causing
the infection in your leg.

24:12.852 --> 24:14.952
If you didn't do anything wrong,
don't worry.

24:14.954 --> 24:18.622
No damn butcher
going to cut my leg open.

24:18.624 --> 24:19.890
That's fine.

24:19.892 --> 24:22.860
You're going to be limping
on one leg anyway.

24:22.862 --> 24:24.495
You get it, genius?

24:24.497 --> 24:27.131
Infection spreads.

24:27.132 --> 24:29.766
The only way to save you
is to chop off that leg.

24:29.769 --> 24:31.769
Don't I get a lawyer?

24:31.771 --> 24:34.705
Yeah, you get
a lawyer.

24:34.707 --> 24:38.542
Cutting my client's leg open
to get a piece of plastic

24:38.544 --> 24:39.677
is an atrocity.

24:39.679 --> 24:41.645
If Judge Waxman
grants my motion

24:41.647 --> 24:43.647
pescador gets
the best medical care.

24:43.649 --> 24:45.783
Intrusive procedures
will be minimal.

24:45.785 --> 24:48.519
The operation
could be life-threatening.

24:48.521 --> 24:51.789
He'll get better odds
than the people at the club.

24:51.791 --> 24:53.657
If he didn't do it?

24:53.659 --> 24:55.693
Surgery against
his will--

24:55.695 --> 24:58.629
it's the ultimate
invasion of privacy.

24:59.899 --> 25:04.735
(<i> printer feeds forward</i> )

25:06.873 --> 25:11.242
There are 53 families screaming
for your client's head.

25:11.244 --> 25:13.244
His right to privacy?

25:13.246 --> 25:15.880
That's for a court
to consider.

25:21.654 --> 25:24.622
ROBINETTE:
to emphasizeould like

25:24.624 --> 25:27.658
the narrow scope
of the pending motion.

25:27.660 --> 25:30.761
The evidence currently imbedded
in the defendant's leg

25:30.763 --> 25:34.031
is essential
to the prosecution of this case.

25:34.033 --> 25:35.766
WAXMAN:
Thank you, counselors.

25:35.768 --> 25:37.101
Be seated.

25:37.103 --> 25:40.571
This is a difficult
decision.

25:40.573 --> 25:43.107
It brings the rights
of the individual

25:43.109 --> 25:45.109
into head-on conflict

25:45.111 --> 25:47.912
with legitimate
governmental requirements.

25:47.914 --> 25:51.582
However,
I'm inclined

25:51.584 --> 25:54.852
to grant
the people's limited request.

25:54.854 --> 25:56.086
What?!

25:56.088 --> 25:58.622
This is worse
than Castro, man!

25:58.624 --> 26:01.759
You can't cut my leg
without my say-so!

26:01.761 --> 26:03.594
I'm not going
to no hospital!

26:03.596 --> 26:04.962
(<i> angry shouting</i> )

26:04.964 --> 26:07.331
I'm not going to no hospital!

26:07.333 --> 26:09.633
WAXMAN:
All of you, sit down!

26:09.635 --> 26:11.602
Quiet in this courtroom.

26:11.604 --> 26:12.870
Quiet!

26:12.872 --> 26:15.773
Quiet or I'll
clear the court.

26:17.843 --> 26:20.044
Excuse me.

26:20.046 --> 26:22.646
Excuse me,
Mr. Pescador.

26:22.648 --> 26:25.683
We can and will.

26:25.685 --> 26:27.818
Now sit down.

26:27.820 --> 26:29.954
The defendant
will submit forthwith

26:29.956 --> 26:31.889
to the surgical procedure

26:31.891 --> 26:34.625
which shall be conducted
in a manner

26:34.627 --> 26:37.027
consistent with this court's
written ruling.

26:37.029 --> 26:39.730
Arson for profit
I can understand

26:39.732 --> 26:41.732
but what was driving
this guy?

26:41.734 --> 26:43.133
Rage, maybe.

26:43.135 --> 26:44.802
It's beyond me.

26:50.676 --> 26:52.710
ROBINETTE:
<i> You have a fix yet?</i>

26:52.712 --> 26:54.845
Polymer analysis,
margin of error

26:54.847 --> 26:57.681
plus or minus
a few measly molecules

26:57.683 --> 26:59.750
but not so you'd notice.

26:59.752 --> 27:01.752
Meaning
you've got a fix.

27:01.754 --> 27:03.887
This piece?

27:03.889 --> 27:06.890
Same plastic found
on the floor of the club.

27:06.892 --> 27:07.891
Absolutely.

27:07.893 --> 27:09.393
Windshield wiper
reservoir?

27:09.395 --> 27:10.861
Good old
American plastic--

27:10.863 --> 27:13.130
still the best
in the world.

27:13.132 --> 27:16.100
It's a miracle this guy
didn't die of toxic shock.

27:16.102 --> 27:19.803
Piece they took out
still has gasoline on it.

27:21.841 --> 27:23.841
ROBINETTE:
Attempted homicide?

27:23.843 --> 27:26.110
Those 53 people are dead.

27:26.112 --> 27:28.112
He didn't mean
to kill anyone.

27:28.114 --> 27:30.848
You're not thinking
about negligent homicide.

27:30.850 --> 27:32.850
If he's only
a messenger boy

27:32.852 --> 27:34.852
he better start
naming names

27:34.854 --> 27:36.420
or he's going down alone.

27:36.422 --> 27:38.722
He says
if he goes to prison

27:38.724 --> 27:40.791
the man
will have him killed.

27:41.727 --> 27:43.093
You don't go to jail

27:43.095 --> 27:45.729
there's about
500 grieving relatives

27:45.731 --> 27:47.831
who'd be happy
to kill you.

27:47.833 --> 27:50.668
I'll take my chances
with them.

27:50.670 --> 27:53.137
This is a ridiculous exercise.

27:53.139 --> 27:55.873
No matter what, he's going down.

27:55.875 --> 27:58.242
Upstate, downstate--
it doesn't matter.

27:58.244 --> 27:59.943
Somebody will get him.

27:59.945 --> 28:02.746
It's not a perfect world, Cesar

28:02.748 --> 28:04.448
but you already
know that.

28:04.450 --> 28:06.784
(<i> moaning</i> )

28:06.786 --> 28:08.986
It ain't... it ain't fair.

28:08.988 --> 28:11.455
That assassin
didn't even pay me.

28:11.457 --> 28:13.090
I get nothing for the deal.

28:13.092 --> 28:14.725
What assassin?

28:14.727 --> 28:16.760
What's the deal?

28:16.762 --> 28:18.062
LAWYER:
Tell him, Cesar.

28:20.132 --> 28:21.932
Tell him!

28:21.934 --> 28:26.236
A lot of people give the<i> cubano</i>

28:26.238 --> 28:28.939
a lot of money for their
<i> micas--</i>

28:28.941 --> 28:31.942
five, six thousand cash.

28:31.944 --> 28:34.845
Then they find out
they're bogus.

28:34.847 --> 28:37.448
Bunch of paper, man.

28:37.450 --> 28:39.917
So they start making noise.

28:39.919 --> 28:41.485
What kind of noise?

28:41.487 --> 28:44.488
A lot of lawyers
telling them

28:44.490 --> 28:46.490
"Hey, you got rights, too."

28:46.492 --> 28:49.827
So the people they want
to turn the<i> cubano</i> in.

28:49.829 --> 28:52.096
So he come to me and he says

28:52.098 --> 28:55.466
"Cesar, Cesar,
I'll tell you what to do.

28:55.468 --> 28:58.202
"You send those people
a message.

28:58.204 --> 29:01.905
You put the fear of God
into them."

29:01.907 --> 29:03.874
By burning down the club?

29:03.876 --> 29:07.010
It was supposed to be a warning.

29:07.012 --> 29:10.180
Like what they do
in El Salvador.

29:10.182 --> 29:14.752
The<i> cubano</i> he says,
"So some people burn

29:14.754 --> 29:17.020
"then so what?

29:17.022 --> 29:21.091
There's a whole lot more
where they come from."

29:22.027 --> 29:24.294
The people in<i> El Cielo--</i>

29:24.296 --> 29:28.031
a lot of Salvadorans.

29:28.033 --> 29:31.535
They got the message.

29:31.537 --> 29:33.871
They got the message.

29:33.873 --> 29:35.205
Ow!

29:43.015 --> 29:45.015
The Cuban--

29:45.017 --> 29:46.884
what's his name?

29:50.055 --> 29:51.789
Guerra.

29:51.791 --> 29:53.023
Domingo Guerra.

29:53.025 --> 29:55.292
He owns a club himself.

29:55.294 --> 29:58.796
The<i> Del Mundo.</i>

29:58.798 --> 30:00.097
<i> Del Mundo.</i>

30:02.468 --> 30:05.035
MAN:
Guerra's my partner.

30:05.037 --> 30:07.471
So he owns 50% of the club.

30:07.473 --> 30:10.274
So he sits around
drinking cuba libres.

30:10.276 --> 30:11.975
I do all the work.

30:11.977 --> 30:13.377
You got a partner?

30:13.379 --> 30:15.879
You're lucky.

30:15.881 --> 30:17.881
Where's Mr. Guerra now?

30:17.883 --> 30:20.384
No idea.

30:22.822 --> 30:24.388
What is this?

30:24.390 --> 30:27.090
You can strong-arm
in Havana

30:27.092 --> 30:28.525
but not here.

30:28.527 --> 30:31.094
I call my lawyer,
he calls it harassment.

30:31.096 --> 30:34.264
We sue your butt
from here to Miami.

30:34.266 --> 30:36.033
God bless America.

30:36.035 --> 30:37.968
This is a search warrant.

30:37.970 --> 30:41.071
It specifically allows us
to look for stolen

30:41.073 --> 30:43.841
or forged
immigration papers.

30:43.843 --> 30:48.111
I don't know about Havana,
but what happens in New York

30:48.113 --> 30:50.047
is that the officers

30:50.049 --> 30:52.049
in pulling
the place apart

30:52.051 --> 30:54.051
come across
other things.

30:54.053 --> 30:57.054
I can't believe Mr. Guerra
had anything to do

30:57.056 --> 30:58.622
with that terrible fire.

30:58.624 --> 31:01.124
I've heard the rumors, yes

31:01.126 --> 31:03.060
but a man of his stature?

31:03.062 --> 31:04.962
Where is he?

31:04.964 --> 31:07.064
<i> Verdad.</i> I don't know.

31:09.468 --> 31:13.070
But he maintains a small office
in the back.

31:13.072 --> 31:17.074
Sometimes he drops by,
occasionally.

31:17.076 --> 31:18.976
For a cuba libre?

31:18.978 --> 31:23.046
Mr. Guerra has many irons
in many fires,<i> senor.</i>

31:29.622 --> 31:31.889
Green card apps.

31:31.891 --> 31:34.024
We also confiscated
two file cabinets

31:34.026 --> 31:35.392
filled with completed forms.

31:35.394 --> 31:38.562
If any of the victims' names
turn up...

31:38.564 --> 31:40.030
still
cross-referencing.

31:40.032 --> 31:41.932
They use
so many aliases

31:41.934 --> 31:44.368
it's hard to know who's who.

31:44.370 --> 31:46.103
At 3,000 a shot

31:46.105 --> 31:49.506
this guy's making
a lot of money.

31:49.508 --> 31:52.643
It's funny
we never heard of him before.

31:52.645 --> 31:55.512
I get the feeling
he's greased a lot of palms

31:55.514 --> 31:57.080
in the Hispanic community.

31:57.082 --> 31:59.483
He sounds like the godfather.

31:59.485 --> 32:03.120
I wonder what Guerra's
immigration status is.

32:08.060 --> 32:11.361
I'm not going to give you

32:11.363 --> 32:14.398
the old "our records
are confidential" speech.

32:14.400 --> 32:17.000
I didn't expect you to, Robert.

32:17.002 --> 32:18.201
I'm flattered

32:18.203 --> 32:20.604
but you overestimate my clout,
Ben.

32:20.606 --> 32:22.172
Oh, I doubt that.

32:22.174 --> 32:24.975
First Latino on fraternity row?

32:24.977 --> 32:28.078
They'd never seen a Cuban
in New Hampshire.

32:28.080 --> 32:29.146
I was a novelty.

32:29.148 --> 32:30.380
Off the record.

32:30.382 --> 32:31.648
Off the record

32:31.650 --> 32:33.116
I know who he is.

32:33.118 --> 32:36.086
Everybody in the community does.

32:36.088 --> 32:38.155
He's got a lot of friends.

32:38.157 --> 32:42.192
I hear he has a lot of irons
in the fire

32:42.194 --> 32:44.962
not all of them on the books.

32:44.964 --> 32:48.098
Guerra is to the Latin community

32:48.100 --> 32:53.070
what Adam Clayton Powell was
to the people of Harlem--

32:53.072 --> 32:55.839
he's a hero.

32:55.840 --> 32:58.607
Heroes don't incinerate
a roomful of innocent people.

32:58.610 --> 33:00.077
That's right.

33:00.079 --> 33:03.080
That's why Guerra
couldn't be involved

33:03.082 --> 33:04.715
in any of this.

33:04.717 --> 33:07.150
It was an awful tragedy.

33:07.152 --> 33:09.686
Maybe your friend's
hiding something.

33:09.688 --> 33:12.155
The only possible thing
that he's hiding

33:12.157 --> 33:13.557
is his agenda.

33:13.559 --> 33:15.125
He's a political
animal.

33:15.127 --> 33:17.561
He's ambitious,
but not dirty.

33:17.563 --> 33:21.098
And since when
is ambition and greed

33:21.100 --> 33:24.001
mutually exclusive?

33:24.003 --> 33:25.769
<i> You</i> don't know him. I do.

33:25.771 --> 33:28.271
Do you?

33:28.273 --> 33:31.608
When I see 53 corpses
on the front page

33:31.610 --> 33:33.143
I don't see friendship.

33:33.145 --> 33:35.078
I see bogus green cards

33:35.080 --> 33:37.781
I see intransigence
in the I.N.S. office

33:37.783 --> 33:40.017
and maybe I see a connection.

33:40.019 --> 33:42.152
That's a bit of a leap.

33:42.154 --> 33:43.553
Fine.

33:43.555 --> 33:45.155
Prove me wrong.

33:45.157 --> 33:52.162
<i> "Un reunion de los amigos"--</i>
a meeting of friends.

33:52.164 --> 33:54.164
Where did you get these?

33:54.166 --> 33:57.567
<i>La Verdad,</i>
the Cuban American newspaper.

33:57.569 --> 34:01.204
The guy in the shades
next to Diaz is Guerra.

34:01.206 --> 34:05.275
The others are prominent
businessmen, politicians.

34:07.212 --> 34:11.048
This one looks like
Robert's yearbook photo.

34:11.050 --> 34:13.183
"I know who he is."

34:13.185 --> 34:17.254
They look a little more
familiar than that.

34:17.256 --> 34:19.256
He's got his arm
around you.

34:19.258 --> 34:20.791
What should I believe?

34:20.793 --> 34:22.592
We're demonstrative people.

34:22.594 --> 34:23.827
Come on, ben.

34:23.829 --> 34:26.730
You've been
to political parties yourself.

34:26.732 --> 34:29.733
Everybody wants to have
their picture taken with you.

34:29.735 --> 34:32.202
Ordinarily, politicians
are discreet enough

34:32.204 --> 34:34.838
to deal with criminals
behind closed doors!

34:34.840 --> 34:36.239
I see, except Latinos.

34:36.241 --> 34:38.842
We're all corrupt
or all on the take.

34:38.844 --> 34:41.578
Tinhorn dictators.

34:41.579 --> 34:44.313
Don't start that oppressed
minority crap with me, Bobby.

34:44.316 --> 34:46.183
We go back too far.

34:46.185 --> 34:49.086
I'm insisting
that your hands are clean.

34:49.088 --> 34:50.854
My boss isn't so sure.

34:54.326 --> 34:57.461
Okay.

34:57.462 --> 35:00.597
Ben, Guerra helped me get
my first job out of law school.

35:00.599 --> 35:02.232
He helped
a lot of us.

35:02.234 --> 35:04.167
You needed a loan,
he was there.

35:04.169 --> 35:06.803
You needed tickets
for fund-raising

35:06.805 --> 35:11.208
he'd have them printed,
then he'd throw in the labor.

35:11.210 --> 35:13.310
What about printing green cards?

35:13.312 --> 35:15.245
On or off the record?

35:15.247 --> 35:18.248
I don't think you understand
the gravity of the situation.

35:18.250 --> 35:20.383
You administer
a green card program.

35:20.385 --> 35:23.386
Guerra has an office
filled with forged forms

35:23.388 --> 35:25.122
which he's selling.

35:25.124 --> 35:27.157
Wake up, Roberto!

35:30.262 --> 35:32.295
Okay.

35:34.700 --> 35:37.868
What can I tell you?

35:37.870 --> 35:40.203
For starters

35:40.205 --> 35:42.672
where was this taken?

35:42.674 --> 35:45.909
This was
the Latino-American club

35:45.911 --> 35:49.346
116th Street and Second Avenue.

36:08.834 --> 36:10.700
Domingo Guerra?

36:10.702 --> 36:13.703
I'm Assistant District
Attorney Ben Stone.

36:13.705 --> 36:16.173
This is A.D.A.
Robinette.

36:16.175 --> 36:19.276
Would you like a drink,
<i> licensario?</i>

36:19.278 --> 36:23.346
I'd like a word
with you, sir.

36:43.302 --> 36:46.269
I never set foot
in<i> El Cielo.</i>

36:46.271 --> 36:49.739
A disco
for Salvadorans?

36:49.741 --> 36:52.709
Do you consider yourself
above them, Mr. Guerra?

36:52.711 --> 36:56.213
Am I being charged
with prejudice?

36:56.215 --> 36:58.215
You can be charged
with conspiracy

36:58.217 --> 37:00.250
to defraud
the United States government

37:00.252 --> 37:01.818
so change your tune.

37:01.820 --> 37:03.320
United States?

37:03.322 --> 37:04.888
STONE:
Yes, sir.

37:04.890 --> 37:07.457
Is the state of New York
pinch-hitting

37:07.459 --> 37:10.360
for the federal government,
Mr. Stone?

37:10.362 --> 37:13.763
No, but what we can do
is charge you

37:13.765 --> 37:15.865
with possession
with intent to sell

37:15.867 --> 37:17.367
forged immigration
documents.

37:17.369 --> 37:21.304
That comes under state
and federal jurisdiction.

37:21.306 --> 37:24.741
Then there will be
Cesar Pescador's testimony

37:24.743 --> 37:28.378
that you offered him money
to burn down the club.

37:30.949 --> 37:34.851
(<i> whispering</i> )

37:36.321 --> 37:38.321
My client
denies this charge

37:38.323 --> 37:41.358
but he's wondering
if you'd be interested

37:41.360 --> 37:43.493
in talking
to an I.N.S. agent.

37:43.495 --> 37:45.762
Which agent?

37:45.764 --> 37:49.499
A man he can implicate
in the deaths of these people

37:49.501 --> 37:51.901
in exchange for a plea bargain.

37:51.903 --> 37:55.372
No, that's
completely premature.

37:55.374 --> 37:59.542
You give us the name
of the agent and we'll see.

38:06.385 --> 38:12.355
(<i> whispering</i> )

38:14.293 --> 38:16.826
The man's name is Collins.

38:16.828 --> 38:19.029
James Collins.

38:19.031 --> 38:21.431
Manhattan office.

38:21.433 --> 38:23.333
Of course I know Guerra.

38:23.335 --> 38:25.435
I've been investigating him
for years.

38:25.437 --> 38:27.470
Why wasn't I apprised
of this?

38:27.472 --> 38:30.407
I don't bother you
with every minor case.

38:30.409 --> 38:31.508
Excuse me-- minor?

38:31.510 --> 38:33.376
The guy hires
illegals

38:33.378 --> 38:34.778
to work day jobs.

38:34.780 --> 38:37.047
They get $20 for ten hours work.

38:37.049 --> 38:38.748
Guerra gets 30 per head.

38:38.750 --> 38:40.984
For this
we get a visit?

38:40.986 --> 38:43.353
The district attorney
has information

38:43.355 --> 38:45.989
that you've been skying
green cards--

38:45.991 --> 38:47.991
you and Guerra
together.

38:47.993 --> 38:50.327
That's slick.

38:50.329 --> 38:52.996
Well, the best defense
is a good offense.

38:52.998 --> 38:55.332
Where did they get this crap?

38:55.334 --> 38:57.334
We are continuing
the investigation

38:57.336 --> 38:59.502
and if you care
to cooperate...

38:59.504 --> 39:02.005
Get lost.

39:04.476 --> 39:06.076
You know the man.

39:06.078 --> 39:08.078
What do you think?

39:16.355 --> 39:18.355
We'll run
an internal audit

39:18.357 --> 39:20.123
see how many apps
he's written

39:20.125 --> 39:22.359
in the past few years.

39:22.361 --> 39:24.027
That's not good enough.

39:24.029 --> 39:26.463
What do you
want me to do?

39:26.465 --> 39:28.465
First,
I give up my patron.

39:28.467 --> 39:31.434
Now it's coming down
on my own office.

39:33.105 --> 39:36.506
GUERRA:
hard to findcigars--

39:36.508 --> 39:38.041
in this country.

39:38.043 --> 39:39.809
Not for long,
I imagine.

39:39.811 --> 39:41.378
Anyway,
I don't smoke

39:41.380 --> 39:43.480
and neither do you
in my office.

39:43.482 --> 39:45.615
What do you bring
to the table?

39:45.617 --> 39:49.486
Proof that my client
was an unwilling participant

39:49.488 --> 39:52.055
in this green card business.

39:52.057 --> 39:54.424
I'm listening.

39:54.426 --> 39:56.193
You know the game.

39:56.194 --> 39:57.961
You want the<i> quid,</i>
we want the<i> quo.</i>

39:57.963 --> 39:59.095
I'm listening

39:59.097 --> 40:01.831
but I'm not making
a blind commitment

40:01.833 --> 40:03.433
to a mass murderer.

40:03.435 --> 40:04.968
I'm a businessman

40:04.970 --> 40:08.471
in business with an agent
of the United States government.

40:08.473 --> 40:12.075
You are a man who betrayed
his people at $3,000 a head.

40:12.077 --> 40:15.412
I don't need to listen
to this cheap suit.

40:15.414 --> 40:17.847
Mr. Guerra will testify
against Collins

40:17.849 --> 40:19.082
of the I.N.S.

40:19.084 --> 40:20.950
To explain to the jury

40:20.952 --> 40:24.454
how Collins conceived the plan
to hire Cesar Pescador

40:24.456 --> 40:27.957
and to threaten the patrons
of the<i> El Cielo</i> into silence.

40:27.959 --> 40:29.859
Maybe you'd explain it to us.

40:29.861 --> 40:32.962
Collins went to a big-league
firebug for help.

40:32.964 --> 40:34.431
Name?

40:34.433 --> 40:36.433
He's called...

40:36.435 --> 40:38.635
Professor.

40:38.637 --> 40:41.171
My client will explain this
and more

40:41.173 --> 40:45.208
in exchange for one count
of conspiracy to defraud.

40:45.210 --> 40:47.010
A class E felony?

40:47.012 --> 40:49.012
Give it up.

40:49.014 --> 40:51.114
The bill of indictments
against you

40:51.116 --> 40:53.583
will probably run
to hundreds of pages.

40:53.585 --> 40:55.151
Now, somewhere in there

40:55.153 --> 40:58.488
I might find a little space
for compromise

40:58.490 --> 41:00.623
possibly
a sentencing recommendation.

41:00.625 --> 41:05.128
<i> ¿Que en el diablo</i>
<i> habla este hombre?</i>

41:05.130 --> 41:08.231
He's being reasonable,
Domingo.

41:08.233 --> 41:11.067
You better cooperate.

41:12.237 --> 41:16.206
Stu Simmons,
Allan Brown, Max Dworkin

41:16.208 --> 41:20.109
and Romaine Ireland.

41:20.111 --> 41:22.111
Addresses?

41:22.113 --> 41:25.148
Simmons still has two to go
in Attica.

41:25.150 --> 41:27.150
Brown's dead.

41:27.152 --> 41:31.120
Dworkin skipped bail--
Tahiti if he's smart.

41:31.122 --> 41:33.122
What about Ireland?

41:33.124 --> 41:35.592
Romie the Bug.

41:35.594 --> 41:37.594
Nine years in the can

41:37.596 --> 41:40.563
for torching a dry cleaners
in Queens.

41:40.565 --> 41:42.632
Paroled last July.

41:44.603 --> 41:46.135
All right,
thanks.

41:46.137 --> 41:48.204
Mm-hmm.

41:48.206 --> 41:51.574
I play bridge, tend my roses.

41:51.576 --> 41:53.510
I read a lot.

41:53.512 --> 41:54.944
Yeah, right.

41:54.946 --> 41:57.514
You're a gentleman
and a scholar.

41:57.516 --> 42:00.216
I never killed anybody.

42:00.218 --> 42:03.786
It's just a business,
and I'm retired.

42:03.788 --> 42:05.788
Not entirely.

42:05.790 --> 42:07.190
Somebody needs advice

42:07.192 --> 42:10.293
you give it to him,
<i> sell it</i> to him.

42:10.295 --> 42:11.761
What am I saying?

42:11.763 --> 42:13.596
Next thing you know

42:13.598 --> 42:16.165
there's 53 corpses
on the sidewalk.

42:16.167 --> 42:19.202
Your M.O.,
Professor.

42:19.204 --> 42:22.138
Your neck.

42:22.140 --> 42:25.041
Okay.

42:25.043 --> 42:27.010
Guy comes up to me--

42:27.012 --> 42:29.579
I don't know,
maybe he's writing a book.

42:29.581 --> 42:32.148
I give him the benefit
of my experience.

42:32.150 --> 42:33.616
Which was?

42:33.618 --> 42:35.084
Which was

42:35.086 --> 42:38.087
if I was to go
into a crowded place

42:38.089 --> 42:40.123
I'd use the hidden
container trick.

42:40.125 --> 42:42.225
What kind of container?

42:42.227 --> 42:45.228
Anything that will fit
down your trouser leg.

42:45.230 --> 42:48.298
In this case,
a windshield washer reservoir.

42:50.035 --> 42:52.068
Is this the guy?

42:55.240 --> 42:59.042
For complete immunity
I could be 100% certain.

43:02.247 --> 43:03.580
You rang, chief?

43:03.582 --> 43:06.215
Come in.

43:08.119 --> 43:10.286
Sit down.

43:17.329 --> 43:20.229
Did you remove
the windshield liquid reservoir

43:20.231 --> 43:22.799
from your partner's car,
Mr. Collins?

43:22.801 --> 43:24.601
The what?

43:24.603 --> 43:26.336
What is this?

43:26.338 --> 43:28.137
Read this.

43:28.139 --> 43:31.307
It's a sworn notarized statement
from the mechanic

43:31.309 --> 43:33.343
who services
your official vehicles.

43:33.345 --> 43:35.612
He witnessed you
under the hood.

43:35.614 --> 43:37.146
He's a liar.

43:37.148 --> 43:39.282
I don't care if it is notarized.

43:39.284 --> 43:41.751
Did you ask Romaine Ireland
for advice

43:41.753 --> 43:44.087
in starting the fire
in club<i> El Cielo?</i>

43:44.089 --> 43:45.288
Never heard of him.

43:45.290 --> 43:47.190
He's heard of you.

43:48.627 --> 43:50.059
I don't care.

43:50.061 --> 43:51.628
I never...

43:51.630 --> 43:53.863
This man.

43:53.865 --> 43:56.299
Remember him now?

43:58.236 --> 44:00.770
Am I under arrest?

44:00.772 --> 44:03.106
Not yet.

44:04.376 --> 44:07.410
Can I at least call a lawyer?

44:12.417 --> 44:14.684
Guerra roped in the victims

44:14.686 --> 44:17.320
but it was Collins
who shut them up.

44:17.322 --> 44:20.657
We'll put them
on trial together.

44:22.193 --> 44:24.293
Solicitation...

44:24.295 --> 44:27.196
criminal solicitation
in the first degree.

44:27.198 --> 44:29.198
Arson in the first degree.

44:29.200 --> 44:31.300
Murder in the second degree,
53 counts.

44:31.302 --> 44:34.337
This will make
a hell of an indictment.

44:34.339 --> 44:37.306
Is Collins worse
than Guerra?

44:37.308 --> 44:41.744
A man in a position to help
who would do that.

44:41.746 --> 44:46.349
What happened to "give me
your huddled masses"?

44:46.351 --> 44:49.852
What the hell's happened
to this city?

44:53.224 --> 44:56.259
