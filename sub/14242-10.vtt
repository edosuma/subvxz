00:28.440 --> 00:30.159
WOMAN: All the way
to the other side of the world.

00:30.280 --> 00:31.759
- Buenos Aires.
- Shanghai.

00:31.880 --> 00:33.719
A mission on both sides of the world?

00:33.840 --> 00:35.559
And you're taking me with you.

00:35.680 --> 00:36.959
- Oh!
- OK?

00:38.360 --> 00:39.999
I never knew about that.

00:42.880 --> 00:45.719
I think it's showing us the way.
It's the Blessing.

00:45.840 --> 00:49.439
It's somewhere over there,
and I think it's calling you, Jack.

00:53.040 --> 00:54.719
When I was about five or six...

00:57.640 --> 00:59.719
...my dad came home from work early.

01:01.560 --> 01:04.519
And I knew there was something wrong.
I could hear voices from the kitchen.

01:06.680 --> 01:08.119
So I looked through the door, and...

01:10.720 --> 01:12.479
...I could see him crying.

01:15.160 --> 01:18.119
It turns out money
had gone missing from work,

01:18.240 --> 01:20.319
and he'd got the blame.

01:20.440 --> 01:24.279
So, I went to get all my pocket money
and I put it in his hand.

01:25.520 --> 01:27.159
It must've been about Â£2.50.

01:29.200 --> 01:32.039
And he looked at me and he said,
"It's not about the money."

01:32.160 --> 01:37.439
He said, "I can't stand anyone
thinking I'm not an honest man."

01:37.560 --> 01:39.719
And I will always remember that.

01:41.280 --> 01:42.719
Always.

01:45.120 --> 01:46.799
Cos that was the first time in my life

01:46.920 --> 01:49.479
anybody had spoken to me
like an adult.

01:52.400 --> 01:56.279
And then we went into the back garden
and we played till dark.

01:59.240 --> 02:01.119
So, that's my dad.

02:02.600 --> 02:05.799

the nicest man in the world.

02:59.160 --> 03:03.559
Er, it's heading southeast 23 degrees,
six minutes, four seconds south.

in both cities.

- Damn it!

03:13.160 --> 03:15.239
- Is that World War II? What's wrong?
- It feels like

03:15.360 --> 03:17.799
all the blood inside me
is trying to get out, churning.

03:17.920 --> 03:20.959
- Tell me about it.
- Why? What's wrong with you?

03:21.080 --> 03:23.519
You're not the only one
affected by the miracle.

03:23.640 --> 03:25.239
It saved Rex's life ,

03:25.360 --> 03:28.439
and we don't know what happens next
if we stop this thing.

03:28.560 --> 03:29.719
Maybe death catches up with him.

03:29.840 --> 03:32.399
OK, OK, enough of the superstition.
Let's get back to the mission, people.

03:32.520 --> 03:34.319
If both cities are connected underground,

03:34.440 --> 03:36.039
- it's like a pole.
- A secondary pole.

03:36.160 --> 03:39.159

It seems like you've been planning
some kind of an explosion,

28:54.840 --> 28:56.719
but I'd love to make sure

28:56.840 --> 28:58.639
you're still inside.

28:58.760 --> 29:00.519
Advantage Torchwood.

29:00.640 --> 29:05.039
Well, I'm afraid we have a major
disagreement here in Buenos Aires.

29:05.160 --> 29:07.399
I'd say advantage families.

29:07.520 --> 29:10.399
Say hello to your friends.

29:10.520 --> 29:13.319
JACK: What's that supposed to mean?

29:13.440 --> 29:15.879
- He means us.
- GWEN: Rex?

29:16.000 --> 29:17.439
Oh, my God. And Esther?

29:17.560 --> 29:19.199
I'm here.

29:19.320 --> 29:20.599
They caught us.

29:20.720 --> 29:22.319
Just glad to hear you're alive.

29:22.440 --> 29:24.279
I'll swap your standoff for my standoff.

29:24.400 --> 29:26.159
- REX: Don't you do it.
- (GUNS COCK)

29:27.120 --> 29:28.239
But nobody dies.

29:28.360 --> 29:31.639
She'll keep on living - just perforated.

29:31.760 --> 29:33.799
- Threaten me, you coward, not her.
- Rex.

29:33.920 --> 29:36.239
- Hey, I'm OK.
- (REX GROANS)

29:36.360 --> 29:39.359
If you hurt her, we've got
explosives here ready to go.

29:39.480 --> 29:40.879
And don't imagine I won't!

29:41.000 --> 29:44.399
Whatever happens here tonight,
there's no place on Earth that I can go,

29:44.520 --> 29:47.559
and I wasn't planning
on coming out of here alive!

29:50.880 --> 29:54.559
So, who's gonna lose their nerve first?

29:54.680 --> 29:55.839
The thing is,

29:55.960 --> 29:57.479
we don't need explosives,

29:57.600 --> 29:59.479
or guns or threats,

29:59.600 --> 30:01.959
cos I've got
the most powerful thing of all.

30:18.880 --> 30:21.119
(CRUNCHING)

30:28.720 --> 30:30.399
It wants me...

30:30.520 --> 30:31.799
mortal blood.

30:31.920 --> 30:34.199
The only one in the whole world.

30:35.800 --> 30:39.239
So, I suggest
you're very careful with me, OK?

30:39.360 --> 30:41.039
And if you fail to take
the Captain's advice,

30:41.160 --> 30:42.959
you can certainly come to oblivion
with me.

30:43.080 --> 30:45.799
Jack, you're the future man.

30:45.920 --> 30:49.159
You've seen wonders
beyond this world,

30:49.280 --> 30:51.919
so tell us of these Blessings
and miracles.

30:53.080 --> 30:55.319
GWEN: What the hell is that thing?

31:00.120 --> 31:03.399
- Can you feel it?
- Yeah.

31:06.680 --> 31:10.039
Oh, yeah. God, I can... OK. God.

31:10.160 --> 31:11.719
Oh, my God.

31:11.840 --> 31:14.399
It is said that it reflects
your own self back at you.

31:17.680 --> 31:18.919
What can you see?

31:19.040 --> 31:21.319
Enough guilt to last me a lifetime.

31:22.760 --> 31:24.119
But that's OK. I'm a working mother.

31:24.240 --> 31:26.319
I don't need the Blessing
to tell me that.

31:26.440 --> 31:27.719
And you, Jack?

31:30.400 --> 31:32.079
I've lived so many lives.

31:33.480 --> 31:35.999
And now I can see them all.

31:38.120 --> 31:39.199
Hey.

31:41.320 --> 31:42.519
Not so bad.

31:42.640 --> 31:46.319
Well, you might want to question
your choice of weapon, soldier.

31:46.440 --> 31:48.799
Let's see. You brought
the world's biggest bastard,

31:48.920 --> 31:50.999
wired him up to a bomb,
then showed him his soul.

31:51.120 --> 31:54.399
Hmm, that's good work. You know,
I feel really safe right now(!)

31:54.520 --> 31:56.399
- JACK: Oswald? Oswald.
- (GRUNTS)

31:56.520 --> 31:57.799
Don't lose it.

31:57.920 --> 31:59.679
Sin.

31:59.800 --> 32:02.599
- The Blessing feels like sin.
- Oswald, don't. I need you.

32:12.840 --> 32:14.479
(PANTS)

32:18.920 --> 32:21.199
I guess I'm accustomed to sin.

32:22.840 --> 32:24.399
- Ah!
- Thank you.

32:26.280 --> 32:28.519
GWEN: I still don't get it.

32:28.640 --> 32:32.559
What are we looking at? The Blessing -
is it the rock or is it the edge? What?

32:32.680 --> 32:34.479
It's the gap in-between.

32:34.600 --> 32:36.439
The nothingness.

32:36.560 --> 32:37.719
The space.

32:37.840 --> 32:39.759
It's alive.

32:39.880 --> 32:43.199
It's like they broke the world.

32:43.320 --> 32:44.639
GWEN: You're the expert.

32:44.760 --> 32:46.559
- What is it?
- The world's been turning

32:46.680 --> 32:49.559
for over four billion years.

32:49.680 --> 32:52.519
There's so much buried under its skin.

32:54.240 --> 32:57.839
The Doctor used to say
there's Silurian mythology,

32:57.960 --> 33:01.279
Huon particles, Racnoss energy,

33:01.400 --> 33:06.039
an expansion of their
hibernation matrix, maybe...

33:06.160 --> 33:07.239
You don't bloody know, do you?

33:07.360 --> 33:09.239
- No. (LAUGHS)
- (LAUGHS)

33:13.640 --> 33:16.239
It's been here since the Earth began?

33:17.320 --> 33:18.399
Could be.

33:18.520 --> 33:21.279
Yeah. Oh, it has. I can feel it.

33:21.400 --> 33:24.559
We're so used to these things
being extraterrestrial,

33:24.680 --> 33:27.599
but this might be the most
terrestrial thing of them all.

33:27.720 --> 33:29.079
Wow.

33:29.200 --> 33:31.319
So, you found the Blessing

33:31.440 --> 33:35.519
- and you worked out this morphic field.
- The Blessing exists

33:35.640 --> 33:38.199
in a symbiotic relationship
with the human race.

33:38.320 --> 33:40.159
It transmits a morphic field
around the planet,

33:40.280 --> 33:44.799
binding us together
like magnetism, like sunlight.

33:44.920 --> 33:47.759
But finding it wasn't enough.
You had to experiment on it.

33:47.880 --> 33:50.399
Oh, we fed it.

33:50.520 --> 33:52.479
We fed it the blood of an immortal.

33:52.600 --> 33:55.319
We had one remarkable artefact.

33:55.440 --> 33:57.759
We found a second remarkable artefact.

33:57.880 --> 34:00.399
The combination was inevitable.

34:00.520 --> 34:04.119
So the Blessing absorbed the blood,
copied it like a new template.

34:04.240 --> 34:08.959
- So, the system changed its setting.
- You know why it did that?

34:09.080 --> 34:11.519
I think you hurt it.

34:11.640 --> 34:14.879
It was being attacked, so it took
the blood pattern and made it a gift.

34:15.000 --> 34:18.879
It's exerting itself to sustain
every person on the planet.

34:19.000 --> 34:20.999
This whole miracle...

34:21.120 --> 34:22.439
it's trying to be kind.

34:22.560 --> 34:24.199
You've seen immortality.

34:24.320 --> 34:27.079
I'm living it.
Why would you want this?

34:27.200 --> 34:28.599
This is only stage one.

34:28.720 --> 34:30.799
But you ruined the world out there!

34:30.920 --> 34:33.479
The miracle shocked the economy.
The economy collapsed.

34:33.600 --> 34:35.439
We tear down in order to rebuild.

34:35.560 --> 34:37.439
And now it's almost within sight...

34:37.560 --> 34:39.239
the new world.

34:39.360 --> 34:41.959
Yeah, with no room for the poor,
the weak or the ones that don't fit in.

34:42.080 --> 34:45.439
That's the way the world works now.
We're just making it official.

34:45.560 --> 34:47.839
The families have just been waiting.

34:47.960 --> 34:50.239
Now we can step in to control the banks.

34:50.360 --> 34:53.079
The banks control government.
The government controls people.

34:53.200 --> 34:58.279
Soon we'll be able to decide who lives,
how long, where and why.

34:58.400 --> 34:59.919
It's about time!

35:00.040 --> 35:02.479
Oh, great(!) So, it's the world
according to Kitzinger, is it?

35:02.600 --> 35:07.039
Listen, you can bleed your liberal heart
all over the place,

35:07.160 --> 35:09.319
but are you really gonna tell me
the world was working before?

35:09.440 --> 35:12.239
Cos I have worked for the rich
and the powerful and the obese.

35:12.360 --> 35:16.199
I have stared into the high end
of Western society, and let me tell you,

35:16.320 --> 35:18.079
it is like shovelling an open sewer.

35:19.280 --> 35:20.479
These families...

35:20.600 --> 35:24.319
they wanna to make the world fitter,
more compact, more disciplined.

35:24.440 --> 35:26.999
And I like the sound of that.

35:27.120 --> 35:28.599
That sounds like salvation.

35:28.720 --> 35:30.039
But before you launched
this brave new world,

35:30.160 --> 35:31.399
you had to deal with one more thing.

35:32.640 --> 35:34.239
Yeah.

35:34.360 --> 35:35.559
Me.

35:35.680 --> 35:38.559
So, as soon as the miracle happened,
you sent the Torchwood e-mail.

35:38.680 --> 35:40.079
His blood endangers the plan.

35:40.200 --> 35:42.879
- We had to draw him out into the open.
- Well, you failed.

35:43.000 --> 35:44.759
I got to Shanghai.

35:44.880 --> 35:47.559
I've got the only mortal blood
on the planet.

35:49.560 --> 35:50.999
If it gets into the Blessing...

35:52.280 --> 35:53.959
...life switches back.

35:55.280 --> 35:57.639
I can make the whole world mortal.

36:02.280 --> 36:04.239
(LAUGHS)

36:09.640 --> 36:11.639
- No.
- Oh, no.

36:11.760 --> 36:12.759
Sadly not.

36:12.880 --> 36:15.119
- He's not listening.
- He doesn't seem to get it.

36:15.240 --> 36:17.519
No, no, no.

36:17.640 --> 36:19.959
- Polar dynamics, Jack.
- Everything on this axis

36:20.080 --> 36:23.439
operates in a polar-dynamic field.

36:23.560 --> 36:25.279
You couldreset the Blessing,

36:25.400 --> 36:28.159
your blood could
make the whole world mortal again,

36:28.280 --> 36:31.119
but only by introducing it
to both cities at once.

36:31.240 --> 36:33.919
- Blood in Buenos Aires.
- Blood in Shanghai.

36:34.040 --> 36:37.879
- Entering the Blessing simultaneously.
- That's how we fed it.

36:38.000 --> 36:40.759
That's how
we made the world immortal.

36:40.880 --> 36:44.279
- For you, I'm sorry, it's impossible.
- You did well, almost worked it out,

36:44.400 --> 36:46.959
but all that spare blood of yours
went up in flames.

36:47.080 --> 36:50.799
So...we're just gonna have to kill you.
(SPEAKS MANDARIN)

36:50.920 --> 36:53.359
No, no, no. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Whoa! Whoa!

36:53.480 --> 36:57.239
Jack, I know how your mind works.
Even now, you're ferociously calculating

36:57.360 --> 37:00.479
how you can get your blood
to the other side of the world.

37:00.600 --> 37:01.879
But I can't allow that. Absolutely not.

37:02.000 --> 37:04.919
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
I'm warning you, I'll do it.

37:05.040 --> 37:06.919
Then I'll die.

37:07.040 --> 37:08.919
And that's a shame,

37:09.040 --> 37:11.039
because you can blast his blood
into that wall,

37:11.160 --> 37:13.639
and it won't make any difference at all.
(BARKS ORDER IN MANDARIN)

37:13.760 --> 37:15.479
- JACK: Listen to me, don't do it.
- I'll do it!

37:15.600 --> 37:19.119
If you need the blood ofJack Harkness
on the other side of the world, then...

37:19.240 --> 37:20.999
I'll do it!

37:21.120 --> 37:23.679
REX: Just listen to me! Jack!

37:23.800 --> 37:26.919
All right.

37:27.040 --> 37:29.319
(PANTS) As I was saying,

37:29.440 --> 37:32.319
if you need Jack's blood...

37:33.520 --> 37:34.959
...how about this?

37:49.120 --> 37:51.759
- What was that? What happened?
- Rex, what did you do?

37:51.880 --> 37:55.079
That's impossible. No way.
There's nothing special about you.

37:55.200 --> 37:58.999
Oh, but there is, when I've got Jack's
blood flowing through my veins.

37:59.120 --> 38:00.479
It's inside me.

38:00.600 --> 38:02.559
- What?
- Oh, my God.

38:02.680 --> 38:05.879
See, we knew this blood was important,
so as soon as we arrived...

38:06.000 --> 38:07.639
We transfused it into Rex.

38:07.760 --> 38:09.759
We exchanged his blood forJack's.

38:14.640 --> 38:16.839
(GRUNTS AND GROANS)

38:20.880 --> 38:23.559
Most days it might've killed me.

38:23.680 --> 38:26.839
But we're all living on Miracle Day.

38:26.960 --> 38:29.159
And everyone thought the blood
was gone, so no-one even suspected.

38:29.280 --> 38:32.719
All we did was keep one final bag,
filled the rest with Rex's blood ,

38:32.840 --> 38:35.079
- and Jack's mortal blood...
- Just walked right in.

38:35.200 --> 38:37.359
Hey, Oswald,
you want to be a walking bomb?

38:37.480 --> 38:39.679
- Get him out of there!
- Well, try this.

38:39.800 --> 38:41.639
Shoot me! Shoot me!
Come on! Shoot me!

38:41.760 --> 38:44.439
- Don't! Don't! Don't!
- Pull that trigger! Splatter my blood!

38:44.560 --> 38:45.799
- Shoot me!
- Get him out! Get him out!

38:45.920 --> 38:47.479
- Nobody move!
- Huh?

38:47.600 --> 38:49.479
Oh, Rex, you're a genius!

38:51.000 --> 38:52.319
(GROANS) You just shut the hell up.

38:52.440 --> 38:54.799
All right? This shit hurts.

38:54.920 --> 38:57.119
Yeah, we've got blood on both sides
of the world, Jack, but...

38:57.240 --> 38:58.599
They will die. Is that what you want?

38:58.720 --> 39:01.879
The Blessing will take every last drop.
You'll both die, gentlemen.

39:02.000 --> 39:03.359
You'll both kill yourselves.

39:03.480 --> 39:06.919
You willdie in a pit in Shanghai.
Is that what you want?

39:07.040 --> 39:11.079
I think I've lived long enough.
Are you ready, Rex?

39:11.200 --> 39:13.959
Oh, you know, I wish
I'd never met you... (CHUCKLES)

39:14.080 --> 39:15.959
...you World War II idiot.

39:22.160 --> 39:23.399
Good times, huh?

39:23.520 --> 39:25.399
Yeah.

39:25.520 --> 39:27.799
I'll see you.

39:31.320 --> 39:33.919
- Just one last thing, Jack.
- What is it?

39:34.040 --> 39:35.279
You're never gonna be a suicide.

39:41.440 --> 39:42.679
Thank you.

39:43.920 --> 39:44.879
Bye, then.

39:45.000 --> 39:46.679
- Bye.
- Face front.

39:50.080 --> 39:52.439
This is it, Rex.

39:55.640 --> 39:56.839
Nothing's gonna stop me.

39:56.960 --> 39:58.439
I think this might.

39:58.560 --> 39:59.959
(GUNSHOT)

40:00.080 --> 40:02.199
No!

40:02.320 --> 40:03.919
No! No!

40:04.040 --> 40:05.999
- What was that?!
- Rex, what was that?

40:06.120 --> 40:07.959
You bastard! You son of a bitch!

40:08.080 --> 40:10.079
Esther, come here. Oh, God.

40:10.200 --> 40:12.119
These are the days of the miracle,
Mr Matheson.

40:12.240 --> 40:15.799
She can't die, and we have
infinite resources. We can help her.

40:15.920 --> 40:19.199
- We can make her better.
- WOMAN: If the miracle ends, she dies.

40:19.320 --> 40:21.559
Is that what you want?

40:21.680 --> 40:24.199
All of you
with your fine and noble deaths,

40:24.320 --> 40:25.799
do you really want to bring about hers?

40:25.920 --> 40:28.199
Jack, what do I do?

40:28.320 --> 40:31.159
- I don't know.
- Oh, God, what do I do?

40:32.400 --> 40:34.479
What do I do?

40:35.800 --> 40:40.159
I'll tell you what you do, Rex - you
carry on. Keep going. Back to the plan.

40:43.000 --> 40:44.999
- We'll kill her.
- I know.

40:45.120 --> 40:46.839
This is Esther we're talking about.

40:46.960 --> 40:49.279
Yes, I know it's Esther
and it's my dad...

40:49.400 --> 40:51.599
and it's everyone who's ever gonna die.

40:51.720 --> 40:53.599
But, Rex, we've gotta do this,

40:53.720 --> 40:55.599
and I'm gonna tell you why.

40:55.720 --> 40:59.639
Because I'm standing here
and I'm staring at Oswald Danes.

40:59.760 --> 41:03.999
And he chose when that girl lived
and he chose when that girl died.

41:04.120 --> 41:08.959
And no-one should have that power.
Not the rich, not the mad, not anyone.

41:09.080 --> 41:11.279
- You're choosing now.
- Yeah, you watch me.

41:11.400 --> 41:14.599
You'll kill Jack
and Rex and that girl, Esther...

41:14.720 --> 41:16.759
all of your Torchwood team?
You'd kill them all?

41:16.880 --> 41:17.919
Yeah...

41:18.040 --> 41:19.039
Yeah.

41:19.160 --> 41:22.479
Oh, you are magnificent.

41:23.880 --> 41:25.719
Ready?

41:27.520 --> 41:29.159
Rex!

41:34.840 --> 41:35.759
I'm sorry.

41:40.160 --> 41:41.359
Yeah.

41:41.480 --> 41:43.759
- I'm so sorry.
- Don't do it! Don't!

41:43.880 --> 41:45.959
Don't do it!

41:46.080 --> 41:47.479
You'll kill her!

42:10.240 --> 42:12.799
(GUARDS SHOUT IN MANDARIN)

42:18.360 --> 42:21.039
GWEN: And that's what I did.

42:21.160 --> 42:22.759
In a pit in Old Shanghai...

42:24.600 --> 42:26.399
...I brought death back to the world.

42:31.400 --> 42:34.959
They said it was like a breath...

42:35.080 --> 42:37.759
the breath that went around
the whole wide world.

42:52.680 --> 42:54.239
The last breath.

42:58.600 --> 43:00.319
And then no more.

43:02.040 --> 43:04.119
We said goodbye to them then...

43:05.240 --> 43:07.119
...the dads and the mums...

43:08.760 --> 43:10.319
...the sick and the old...

43:11.680 --> 43:13.639
...the friends and the neighbours...

43:15.520 --> 43:17.559
...and the people we once met...

43:21.800 --> 43:24.079
...and the people
whose names we never knew.

43:36.440 --> 43:38.159
We said goodbye to them all...

43:40.000 --> 43:43.879
...on the day that death...came back.

43:45.280 --> 43:46.679
(RUMBLING)

43:46.800 --> 43:48.359
Jesus Christ Almighty!

44:04.840 --> 44:05.919
Shit!

44:06.040 --> 44:07.559
Ah!

44:07.680 --> 44:10.039
- WOMAN: Ah!
- OSWALD: Go!

44:13.000 --> 44:15.519
I'm giving you this one chance.

44:16.640 --> 44:19.319
I'll give you estates!
I'll give you places to hunt!

44:26.760 --> 44:28.359
(GASPS) Ah!

44:31.240 --> 44:32.599
Hold that lift!

44:40.360 --> 44:43.599
- Guess what... Death came back.
- No!

44:43.720 --> 44:45.599
(SCREAMS)

44:56.000 --> 44:57.079
He changed back!

44:57.200 --> 44:58.759
He's immortal!

45:01.120 --> 45:02.959
Wait!

45:03.080 --> 45:05.279
(JILLY SCREAMS)

45:19.000 --> 45:21.279
At last! A miracle!

45:23.640 --> 45:28.199
How...much...bloody...lipstick
can you wear?

45:39.400 --> 45:40.799
OSWALD: Better run, Torchwood!

45:40.920 --> 45:43.639
I'm taking this thing with me!
The whole thing!

45:43.760 --> 45:45.159
Please! For God's sake, help me!

45:45.280 --> 45:47.759
Help me!

45:50.720 --> 45:54.479
- Oh, soon I'll see her!
- You won't see anybody!

45:54.600 --> 45:56.479
You're going to hell, Danes!

45:56.600 --> 45:58.199
But that's where they go!

45:58.320 --> 46:03.359
All the bad little girls, they run
straight to hell, and I'm following!

46:05.080 --> 46:06.479
Come on!

46:10.000 --> 46:12.559
Susie, keep running!
I'm coming to get you!

46:14.600 --> 46:17.839
Run! Faster!

46:20.120 --> 46:21.279
Faster!

46:23.120 --> 46:24.239
Jilly!

46:24.360 --> 46:26.319
Ahhh!

46:39.360 --> 46:40.959
FEDERICO: Get 'em out!

46:46.000 --> 46:48.119
Get 'em out!

46:48.240 --> 46:49.879
Get them out!

47:07.360 --> 47:09.759
Esther and Rex,
did I just kill them?

47:43.200 --> 47:44.759
(CHURCH ORGAN PLAYS)

47:46.960 --> 47:54.319
# The day thou gavest, Lord, is ended

47:54.440 --> 48:00.559
# The darkness falls at thy behest

48:00.680 --> 48:08.039
# To thee our mourning hymns ascended

48:08.160 --> 48:14.839
# Thy praise shall sanctify our rest

48:15.960 --> 48:23.359
# We thank thee that
thy church unsleeping

48:23.480 --> 48:29.639
# While Earth rolls onward into light

48:29.760 --> 48:37.039
# Through all the world
her watch is keeping

48:37.160 --> 48:44.519
# And rest not now by day nor night

48:44.640 --> 48:48.759
# As o'er each continent and island... #

48:59.040 --> 49:00.439
We meet again.

49:11.840 --> 49:15.919
I have been coming here
every day for weeks...

49:17.440 --> 49:18.999
...waiting for you.

49:19.120 --> 49:21.039
We tend not to repeat
patterns of behaviour.

49:21.160 --> 49:23.839
But...just this once.

49:27.200 --> 49:28.759
I've got nothing.

49:28.880 --> 49:31.119
What the hell am I supposed to do?

49:31.240 --> 49:33.919
I had to buy my way out
of that godforsaken country.

49:34.040 --> 49:35.679
I had to sell my own jewellery!

49:35.800 --> 49:36.919
I can't go home.

49:37.040 --> 49:40.439
I've got the CIA watching out for me,
the FBI, everyone.

49:40.560 --> 49:44.239
What do I do now?

49:44.360 --> 49:46.119
You start again.

49:46.240 --> 49:47.559
With who?

49:47.680 --> 49:49.679
Us.

49:54.880 --> 49:56.279
Why would I do that

49:56.400 --> 49:58.399
after everything
you have put me through?

49:58.520 --> 50:01.479
Because we very nearly succeeded.

50:01.600 --> 50:03.719
As trial runs go,

50:03.840 --> 50:05.919
it was good.

50:06.040 --> 50:07.479
Trial runs for what?

50:07.600 --> 50:09.919
Plan B.

50:12.040 --> 50:13.239
Interested?

50:35.120 --> 50:36.319
I'm sorry, Rex.

50:36.440 --> 50:38.719
She was more than a colleague.
I'd like to think she was a friend.

50:38.840 --> 50:40.359
Thanks. Appreciate it.

50:42.720 --> 50:44.079
Ready?

50:44.200 --> 50:45.999
Lucky she got a full service.

50:46.120 --> 50:48.439
There's ten funerals every hour
these days...

50:48.560 --> 50:49.959
catching up with the backlog.

50:50.080 --> 50:51.679
Well, that's made us all feel better(!)

50:51.800 --> 50:53.839
You'd think
if that Blessing was so kind,

50:53.960 --> 50:56.399
it could've shown some sort of...grace.

50:56.520 --> 50:57.959
Esther died right in front of it.

50:58.080 --> 51:01.759
That morphic field could've reached out
and saved one last life. Why not?

51:01.880 --> 51:04.839
We'll never know.
UNIT's sealed those sites up for ever.

51:04.960 --> 51:06.959
- Let that thing stay buried.
- Yeah.

51:07.080 --> 51:10.439
What about you two, this Torchwood
team? You reunited or what?

51:10.560 --> 51:11.839
Say no, please.

51:11.960 --> 51:14.479
- Dunno. You staying?
- Do you want me to stay?

51:14.600 --> 51:15.959
Please say no.

51:16.080 --> 51:17.959
(BEEPING)

51:18.080 --> 51:19.959
Oh, boy. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

51:20.080 --> 51:22.879
- JACK: Anything wrong?
- It's about Noah.

51:23.000 --> 51:24.719
You know, the analyst
that died with Shapiro?

51:24.840 --> 51:27.799
They just retrieved his software
from the explosion.

51:27.920 --> 51:30.679
The good thing is, he told me
his password, because it's the same place

51:30.800 --> 51:32.199
I used to go for doughnuts.

51:32.320 --> 51:34.239
His last job was to look for that leak.

51:36.240 --> 51:38.159
- What is it? What's it say?
- Shit.

51:43.080 --> 51:44.959
Charlotte!

51:45.080 --> 51:46.679
(SHOUTS) Charlotte!

51:47.960 --> 51:49.639
Charlotte!

51:56.640 --> 51:57.799
Get help! Clear the area!

51:57.920 --> 51:59.239
- There might be more!
- GWEN: Oh, no!

51:59.360 --> 52:00.679
JACK: No way.

52:00.800 --> 52:04.119
Come on. No, no. Not after
everything he's gone through. No!

52:04.240 --> 52:05.679
JACK: There's nothing we can do. I'm...

52:05.800 --> 52:07.159
I'm sorry, Gwen.

52:09.320 --> 52:10.639
I am so sorry.

52:12.200 --> 52:13.479
He's dead.

52:15.400 --> 52:17.439
(GASPS)

52:19.960 --> 52:21.159
- What?
- What?

52:21.280 --> 52:23.439
What?

52:28.440 --> 52:29.719
What?!

52:29.840 --> 52:30.999
What the hell?

52:32.040 --> 52:33.999
That's impossible.

52:34.120 --> 52:35.839
You,

52:35.960 --> 52:37.279
World War II,

52:37.400 --> 52:38.799
what the hell did you do to me?
