WEBVTT

00:00.933 --> 00:02.600
[cheers]
- OKAY, THAT IS IT.

00:02.600 --> 00:04.767
EVERYBODY OUT OF MY HOUSE.
RAY!

00:04.767 --> 00:06.933
IF THEY MISS THAT BUS,
YOU'RE DRIVING THEM.

00:06.933 --> 00:09.767
- OH, I GOT THE JACKET!
I GOT IT!

00:09.767 --> 00:11.167
COME ON.
STOP IT, STOP IT.

00:11.167 --> 00:12.533
- HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING,
HUH?

00:12.533 --> 00:13.733
COME ON NOW.

00:13.733 --> 00:14.933
YOU KNOW BOTH ARMS
DON'T GO IN ONE HOLE.

00:14.933 --> 00:17.333
- BUONGIORNO!

00:17.333 --> 00:19.367
- WE'RE BACK
FROM OUR HONEYMOON.

00:19.367 --> 00:20.467
- HE'S GOT NO SHOE.
WHERE'S HIS SHOE?

00:20.467 --> 00:22.067
- WHAT DID YOU DO?
HERE.

00:22.067 --> 00:23.600
TAKE THIS ONE.
- IT DOESN'T MATCH.

00:23.600 --> 00:25.300
- I DON'T CARE.
DON'T PUT IT ON IN HERE.

00:25.300 --> 00:26.400
YOU TAKE THAT SHOE. YOU PUT IT
ON AT THE BUS STOP. GO.

00:26.400 --> 00:28.300
- HEY, KIDS.
[horn honking]

00:28.300 --> 00:29.767
- ALL RIGHT, THE BUS IS HERE.
YOU GUYS BETTER RUN.

00:29.767 --> 00:31.433
- GO. RUN.
- AND, MICHAEL, DON'T FORGET

00:31.433 --> 00:33.300
TO GIVE YOUR NOTE TO MRS. ABBY.
NO GYM TODAY.

00:33.300 --> 00:35.233
- WAIT, GEOFFREY'S HOMEWORK.
HIS HOMEWORK.

00:35.233 --> 00:38.467
- HOLD THE BUS.
HOLD THE BUS!

00:38.467 --> 00:42.100
- I FOUND THE OTHER SHOE.
I FOUND THE OTHER SHOE.

00:46.367 --> 00:50.033
- I DON'T THINK
WE MISSED ANYTHING.

00:52.233 --> 00:53.333
- THE DRIVER'S SUCH A JERK.

00:53.333 --> 00:54.833
HE SEES ME RUNNING AT HIM,

00:54.833 --> 00:55.833
WAVING THIS, YELLING,

00:55.833 --> 00:58.367
HE STILL TAKES OFF.

00:58.367 --> 01:00.500
- I THINK HE WAS SCARED.

01:02.800 --> 01:05.167
- HI, DEBRA.
- HI. HI.

01:05.167 --> 01:07.367
HI, ROBERT.
- HIYA, SIS.

01:07.367 --> 01:10.233
- YEAH, WELCOME BACK.
WHAT'S UP?

01:12.767 --> 01:16.167
- HOW WAS ITALY?

01:16.167 --> 01:18.700
- GREAT!
- IT WAS SO FANTASTIC.

01:18.700 --> 01:19.900
- YEAH, WELL, GUESS WHAT.

01:19.900 --> 01:21.933
NOW THAT THE HONEYMOON'S OVER...

01:21.933 --> 01:24.867
THE HONEYMOON'S OVER.

01:24.867 --> 01:27.000
- IT'S NOT OVER IN HERE,

01:27.000 --> 01:30.267
AND IT'S NOT OVER IN HERE.

01:30.267 --> 01:35.733
- THAT'S BECAUSE
THAT IS IN THERE.

01:42.333 --> 01:45.500
- SO YOU TWO LOOK GREAT.
DID YOU HAVE FUN?

01:45.500 --> 01:46.967
- OH, YEAH.

01:46.967 --> 01:48.900
VENICE AND FLORENCE...

01:48.900 --> 01:50.133
- LIKE A PAINTING.

01:50.133 --> 01:51.567
EVERY NIGHT AT SUNSET,

01:51.567 --> 01:53.467
WE'D GET ON THE GONDOLA
WITH A BOTTLE OF WINE

01:53.467 --> 01:56.500
AND JUST FLOAT
DOWN THE GRAND CANAL.

01:56.500 --> 01:58.367
- AND THE GONDOLIERS
WOULD SING FOR US,

01:58.367 --> 02:03.333
AND WE'D SIP OUR WINE
UNDER A BLANKET AND CUDDLE.

02:03.333 --> 02:07.267
- AND IT WAS SO BEAUTIFUL,
WE'D JUST START TO CRY.

02:16.233 --> 02:19.033
- WHAT DID YOU GUYS DO
THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS?

02:26.000 --> 02:26.567
- [chuckles]

02:27.500 --> 02:28.567
I LOVE SEEING
RAYMOND LIKE THIS.

02:28.567 --> 02:31.667
- LIKE WHAT?
- DEPRESSED.

02:31.667 --> 02:33.567
- LOOK WHO'S HERE!

02:33.567 --> 02:34.667
- HI, MA.

02:34.667 --> 02:37.500
- OH, HONEY!

02:37.500 --> 02:39.533
OH, I THOUGHT I SAW
YOU TWO COME IN HERE.

02:39.533 --> 02:43.500
I'VE BEEN LOOKING OUT THE WINDOW
FOR THE LAST TWO DAYS.

02:43.500 --> 02:46.267
- SHE SCARED THE CRAP
OUT OF THE MAILMAN.

02:48.033 --> 02:50.233
- YOU TWO LOOK SO WONDERFUL.

02:50.233 --> 02:52.467
- THANKS, MA.
YOU LOOK NICE TOO.

02:52.467 --> 02:55.967
- HEY, MA.
- COME ON, LET'S SIT DOWN.

02:55.967 --> 02:58.067
I WANT TO HEAR EVERYTHING.

02:58.067 --> 02:59.800
- MA, I JUST SAID HI.

02:59.800 --> 03:01.600
- RAYMOND, CAN'T YOU SEE

03:01.600 --> 03:04.200
WE'RE HAVING A CONVERSATION?

03:06.700 --> 03:09.600
ROBBIE'S HOME!

03:09.600 --> 03:12.467
WITH HIS BEAUTIFUL
NEW BRIDE!

03:12.467 --> 03:14.567
- HI, MA!

03:18.700 --> 03:19.800
- OH, WE HAVE PRESENTS!

03:19.800 --> 03:21.433
- PRESENTS TOO?

03:21.433 --> 03:23.533
BUT JUST SEEING
YOU TWO IS A PRESENT.

03:23.533 --> 03:26.000
- OPEN THE BAG.

03:27.900 --> 03:30.033
- OH, YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO.

03:30.033 --> 03:32.433
- THIS IS
THE MOST THOUGHTFUL GIFT

03:32.433 --> 03:34.233
ANYONE HAS EVER GIVEN ME.

03:34.233 --> 03:39.467
- WHAT IS IT?
- IT'S A PIECE OF SHRAPNEL.

03:39.467 --> 03:42.500
- IT'S FROM WORLD WAR II
IN ANZIO.

03:44.333 --> 03:47.433
- IT'S WONDERFUL.

03:47.433 --> 03:50.700
I'LL BET IT'S FROM
THE ASS OF SOME KRAUT.

03:55.700 --> 03:58.167
- OH, LOOK!
A PIN!

03:58.167 --> 04:01.033
- THAT'S ANTIQUE,
100 YEARS OLD.

04:01.033 --> 04:03.667
ANTIQUE.

04:03.667 --> 04:06.300
- FRANK, LOOK.

04:06.300 --> 04:09.033
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

04:09.033 --> 04:11.433
100 YEARS OLD!

04:17.767 --> 04:19.767
- I THINK IT'S LOVELY,

04:19.767 --> 04:21.000
JUST LOVELY.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.900
- OHH...

04:22.900 --> 04:26.067
- WHAT THE HELL?

04:26.067 --> 04:27.733
- AH, THIS IS SO NICE.

04:27.733 --> 04:29.933
OH, SPEAKING OF GIFTS,
HOW DID YOU LIKE

04:29.933 --> 04:32.533
WHAT LEE AND STAN GOT YOU
FOR YOUR WEDDING PRESENT?

04:32.533 --> 04:34.667
- OH, YES.
WHAT WAS IT AGAIN?

04:34.667 --> 04:37.933
SOME SORT OF PORCELAIN THING
OR A SCULPTURE?

04:37.933 --> 04:39.167
- OH, NO, NO, NO.

04:39.167 --> 04:41.500
IT WAS A LARGE
CRYSTALLY COVERED CANDLE

04:41.500 --> 04:44.300
WHICH THEY HAD MADE
WITH YOUR WEDDING INVITATION

04:44.300 --> 04:46.667
IN A KIND OF WINDOW
WITHIN THE WAX

04:46.667 --> 04:49.133
SO THAT, WHEN
THE CANDLE BURNS DOWN,

04:49.133 --> 04:53.667
THE INVITATION
IS ILLUMINATED FROM BEHIND.

04:55.300 --> 04:57.800
YOU KNOW, THE ORANGE ONE?

04:57.800 --> 05:00.067
- RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT. YES.

05:00.067 --> 05:03.333
IT WAS...BEAUTIFUL.

05:03.333 --> 05:05.667
- I THOUGHT IT WAS SO CLEVER.

05:05.667 --> 05:08.233
THEY JUST WANTED
TO MAKE SURE YOU GOT IT.

05:08.233 --> 05:10.733
- OH, YEAH, WE GOT IT.

05:10.733 --> 05:12.933
- 'CAUSE THEY HAD IT
SPECIALLY MADE.

05:12.933 --> 05:15.067
- WE GOT IT, MA.
VERY NICE.

05:15.067 --> 05:17.300
- SO I'LL TELL THEM
THAT YOU GOT IT.

05:17.300 --> 05:19.633
THEY DIDN'T KNOW...

05:19.633 --> 05:23.733
BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T GET
A THANK-YOU NOTE.

05:23.733 --> 05:25.900
- OH. WELL...

05:25.900 --> 05:28.000
- WELL, MOM, THEY'RE GONNA
GET A THANK-YOU NOTE.

05:28.000 --> 05:29.567
IT'S JUST, YOU KNOW...

05:29.567 --> 05:31.967
- OF COURSE.
YOU'RE GONNA SEND ONE, RIGHT?

05:31.967 --> 05:33.667
I MEAN, YOU'RE GONNA BE SENDING
OUT THANK-YOU NOTES,

05:33.667 --> 05:34.733
AREN'T YOU, AMY?

05:34.733 --> 05:37.133
- YEAH, SURE, MARIE.
I'LL GET TO IT.

05:37.133 --> 05:38.467
- OKAY, GOOD.

05:38.467 --> 05:43.400
WHEN YOU SAY "GET TO IT"...

05:43.400 --> 05:45.467
WHEN DO YOU THINK
YOU'D BE DOING THEM?

05:45.467 --> 05:49.800
BECAUSE PEOPLE
HAVE BEEN COMMENTING.

05:49.800 --> 05:52.467
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
WHO'S COMMENTING?

05:52.467 --> 05:53.633
- PEOPLE.

05:53.633 --> 05:56.567
SO, AMY, WHEN CAN I
TELL THE PEOPLE

05:56.567 --> 05:59.367
TO EXPECT
THEIR THANK-YOU NOTES?

05:59.367 --> 06:03.667
- WELL...CAN I BE
HONEST WITH YOU, MARIE?

06:03.667 --> 06:07.133
- UH-OH.

06:07.133 --> 06:09.600
- OF COURSE.
YOU CAN SAY ANYTHING TO ME.

06:09.600 --> 06:11.033
WE'RE FAMILY.

06:11.033 --> 06:15.300
- UH-OH.

06:15.300 --> 06:18.367
- WELL, YOU KNOW,
WE JUST GOT BACK

06:18.367 --> 06:19.867
FROM OUR HONEYMOON, AND--

06:19.867 --> 06:21.800
- OH.
- WHAT?

06:21.800 --> 06:23.367
- NOTHING.

06:23.367 --> 06:24.867
I JUST THOUGHT YOU WERE GONNA
BE HONEST WITH ME.

06:24.867 --> 06:26.833
I MEAN, TO TELL THE TRUTH,
YOU TWO HAVE BEEN HOME

06:26.833 --> 06:29.367
FOR A DAY AND A HALF NOW,
HAVEN'T YOU?

06:34.900 --> 06:40.067
- WELL, WE JUST WANTED
TO UNWIND FOR A LITTLE BIT.

06:40.067 --> 06:41.733
- BUT YOU KNEW I WAS WAITING.

06:41.733 --> 06:43.467
NO CALL OR ANYTHING.

06:43.467 --> 06:45.367
I WAS SO WORRIED,
I CALLED THE AIRLINES.

06:45.367 --> 06:47.600
I THOUGHT, "WHAT IF
THERE WAS A PLANE CRASH?"

06:47.600 --> 06:49.833
BUT WHEN THEY SAID
OF COURSE THERE WAS NONE,

06:49.833 --> 06:52.333
I HAVE TO TELL YOU,
I WAS A LITTLE UPSET.

07:00.067 --> 07:01.800
AND NOW TO MAKE SUCH A FUSS

07:01.800 --> 07:04.500
WHEN I'M JUST ASKING
ABOUT THANK-YOU NOTES...

07:04.500 --> 07:07.100
YOU KNOW, I WOULD LIKE TO THINK
THAT WE'RE AT LEAST GRATEFUL

07:07.100 --> 07:09.333
FOR THE GOOD FORTUNE
AND GENEROSITY

07:09.333 --> 07:13.067
BESTOWED UPON US
BY PEOPLE WHO LOVE US.

07:17.067 --> 07:20.700
- "THANK YOU
FOR MY SHRAPNEL."

07:34.867 --> 07:38.033
- MARIE, I CAN'T BELIEVE
THIS MEANS SO MUCH TO YOU.

07:38.033 --> 07:39.400
BUT, IF IT DOES,

07:39.400 --> 07:41.467
I'LL WRITE THE NOTES
AS SOON AS I CAN.

07:41.467 --> 07:43.633
- AND WHEN WILL THAT BE, DEAR?

07:43.633 --> 07:45.800
SO I CAN TELL EVERYONE.

07:45.800 --> 07:47.200
- I DON'T KNOW, MARIE.

07:47.200 --> 07:48.600
CAN'T YOU JUST TELL THEM

07:48.600 --> 07:50.833
THEY'LL GET THEM
WHEN THEY GET THEM?

07:50.833 --> 07:53.767
- I SEE.

07:53.767 --> 07:55.333
I HAVE TO SAY, AMY,

07:55.333 --> 07:59.133
THAT I'M A LITTLE SURPRISED
AND DISAPPOINTED.

07:59.133 --> 08:01.467
- AND I HAVE TO SAY, MARIE,

08:01.467 --> 08:05.300
I REALLY DON'T CARE
ABOUT THIS RIGHT NOW.

08:17.100 --> 08:19.167
- HEY!

08:19.167 --> 08:21.633
- WE'RE LEAVING, FRANK.

08:21.633 --> 08:22.900
- OH, COME ON, MOM.

08:22.900 --> 08:24.167
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE BEING
A LITTLE CRAZY ABOUT--

08:24.167 --> 08:27.633
- WHAT DID YOU SAY TO ME?

08:30.067 --> 08:33.200
- [whispers]
NOTHING.

08:50.167 --> 08:54.600
- ROBBIE'S HOME!

08:54.600 --> 08:56.067
[laughing]

09:00.100 --> 09:03.267
- THAT COULD'VE GONE BETTER.

09:07.033 --> 09:09.567
- NICE GOING, AMY.

09:10.733 --> 09:12.267
- WHAT HAPPENED?

09:12.267 --> 09:15.233
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

09:15.233 --> 09:16.933
- OH, HONEY.

09:16.933 --> 09:19.600
YOU MARRIED
INTO THE MANSON FAMILY.

09:24.467 --> 09:28.500
AND CHARLIE GOES OFF
SOMETIMES.

09:29.900 --> 09:31.433
- I DIDN'T MEAN TO ARGUE.

09:31.433 --> 09:34.167
IT'S THANK-YOU NOTES.
IT'S SO STUPID.

09:34.167 --> 09:36.200
- HEY, HEY, HEY,
HEY, HEY.

09:36.200 --> 09:37.667
LOOK AT ME.

09:37.667 --> 09:41.800
YOU WERE GREAT.

09:41.800 --> 09:43.467
DO YOU HEAR ME?

09:43.467 --> 09:45.900
YOU CAN'T LET HER
GET AWAY WITH ANYTHING.

09:45.900 --> 09:47.733
- BUT SHE'S SO UPSET.

09:47.733 --> 09:49.667
I DON'T WANT
A BAD RELATIONSHIP WITH HER.

09:49.667 --> 09:50.800
I SHOULD GO APOLOGIZE.

09:50.800 --> 09:53.233
- NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

09:53.233 --> 09:56.033
HEY, LISTEN, THAT IS EXACTLY
WHAT SHE IS WAITING FOR,

09:56.033 --> 09:57.467
FOR YOU TO GO OVER THERE

09:57.467 --> 09:58.867
AND SAY YOU'LL WRITE
THOSE THANK-YOU NOTES.

09:58.867 --> 10:01.667
YOU HAVE GOT TO BE STRONG.

10:01.667 --> 10:03.433
SHE IS TESTING YOU.

10:03.433 --> 10:04.833
TRUST ME,
WHAT SHE JUST PULLED HERE,

10:04.833 --> 10:07.633
THAT'S HER BIG WEAPON,
THE GUILT BOMB.

10:07.633 --> 10:10.000
AND IT DOESN'T HELP THAT
ALL THE MEN IN HER FAMILY

10:10.000 --> 10:12.333
ARE SCARED TO DEATH OF HER.

10:18.000 --> 10:19.667
WHENEVER SHE COMES UP AGAINST
SOMEBODY WITH A BACKBONE

10:19.667 --> 10:21.533
WHO MIGHT ACTUALLY
CONFRONT HER,

10:21.533 --> 10:24.233
SHE'S COMPLETELY THREATENED
AND SHE GETS HER CLAWS OUT.

10:24.233 --> 10:26.267
AND SO SHE HAS BEEN
ALLOWED TO RULE THIS WAY,

10:26.267 --> 10:29.567
UNOPPOSED, FOR DECADES.

10:29.567 --> 10:31.933
LISTEN, AMY...

10:31.933 --> 10:35.133
I HAVE BEEN
WAITING FOR YOU.

10:43.100 --> 10:44.600
THIS IS A CRITICAL TIME.

10:44.600 --> 10:46.400
EVEN THOUGH THIS IS
A TOUGH REGIME TO TOPPLE,

10:46.400 --> 10:48.667
WITH YOU IN THE FAMILY,
NOW WE HAVE A SHOT,

10:48.667 --> 10:51.100
YOU AND ME TOGETHER,
TO END ALL THE SUFFERING.

10:51.100 --> 10:53.733
DO YOU HEAR ME?
WE CAN DO IT!

10:55.800 --> 10:58.300
[Ray laughs]

10:58.300 --> 11:00.000
- WHAT IS SO FUNNY?

11:00.000 --> 11:02.933
- YOU'RE SO NUTS.

11:02.933 --> 11:04.500
YOU STILL, AFTER 15 YEARS,

11:04.500 --> 11:07.467
HAVEN'T FIGURED ANYTHING OUT
ABOUT THIS WOMAN?

11:07.467 --> 11:09.333
AMY...

11:09.333 --> 11:11.767
HERE'S HOW I SEE
ALL THIS STUFF.

11:16.333 --> 11:19.900
MOM LOVES THE FAMILY.
SHE REALLY DOES.

11:19.900 --> 11:24.467
AND SHE THINKS IT'S HER JOB
TO HOLD IT ALL TOGETHER.

11:24.467 --> 11:28.067
DOES SHE OVERREACT
OCCASIONALLY?

11:29.400 --> 11:31.733
OKAY.

11:33.367 --> 11:36.367
SO SHE WANTS YOU TO WRITE
A FEW THANK-YOU NOTES.

11:36.367 --> 11:40.733
SHE'S AN OLD LADY.
WHAT ELSE DOES SHE HAVE?

11:40.733 --> 11:45.467
BESIDES, BEFORE EVEN
GIVING UP A DROP OF POWER,

11:45.467 --> 11:48.767
SHE WILL TRULY KILL US ALL.

11:56.100 --> 11:58.233
- WHAT DO YOU THINK,
ROBERT?

11:58.233 --> 12:00.033
- I AGREE WITH RAYMOND.
- OH, COME ON!

12:00.033 --> 12:02.667
- NO, NO.

12:04.067 --> 12:06.000
I TOTALLY AGREE,
AND I EVEN ADD

12:06.000 --> 12:08.667
THAT BECAUSE MA FAVORS RAYMOND
SO MUCH MORE THAN ME,

12:08.667 --> 12:11.600
YOU WILL HAVE TO BE
DOUBLY NICE.

12:13.933 --> 12:16.867
- YOU'RE BOTH IDIOTS.

12:16.867 --> 12:19.500
- YOU KNOW, IT'S REAL EASY
TO MAKE TROUBLE, MISSY, OKAY?

12:19.500 --> 12:22.100
BUT WHEN MA'S UPSET WITH YOU,
WE'RE THE ONES WHO SUFFER!

12:22.100 --> 12:24.400
- PLEASE DON'T MAKE HER MAD.

12:25.933 --> 12:27.600
- ALL RIGHT, STOP.

12:27.600 --> 12:30.300
WHY DOES THIS FAMILY
HAVE TO BE THIS WAY,

12:30.300 --> 12:32.500
WITH MARIE WIELDING
SO MUCH POWER

12:32.500 --> 12:34.100
AND EVERYONE LIVING IN FEAR

12:34.100 --> 12:35.967
INSTEAD OF JUST ENJOYING
EACH OTHER?

12:35.967 --> 12:37.367
- YOU ARE RIGHT, AMY.

12:37.367 --> 12:40.167
THAT HAS BEEN
MY PHILOSOPHY FROM DAY ONE.

12:40.167 --> 12:43.033
HARMONY, LOVE,
UNDERSTANDING--

12:43.033 --> 12:45.700
THAT IS WHAT HOLDS
A FAMILY TOGETHER.

12:45.700 --> 12:48.133
MARIE IS GOING DOWN.

12:48.133 --> 12:50.533
- NO, NO, NO, NO.
PLEASE STOP THIS.

12:50.533 --> 12:52.133
- THIS IS WHAT WE DO.
- I CAN'T TAKE THIS.

12:52.133 --> 12:53.833
I CAN'T--RAYMOND!
- NO MORE CRAP.

12:53.833 --> 12:55.967
WE STAND UP; WE CONFRONT.

12:55.967 --> 12:57.433
- I'M NOT AFRAID TO CONFRONT.

12:57.433 --> 13:00.133
- MY LIFE WAS SUPPOSED
TO GET BETTER.

13:00.133 --> 13:01.800
- THAT'S GOOD.

13:01.800 --> 13:04.133
NOW, WITH THESE THANK-YOU NOTES,
HERE'S WHAT WE DO.

13:04.133 --> 13:06.067
YOU WAIT A MONTH,
TWO MONTHS.

13:06.067 --> 13:07.400
- REALLY? YOU THINK?

13:07.400 --> 13:10.200
- ANY SOONER,
AND MARIE WINS.

13:10.200 --> 13:12.467
YOU SET THE TIMETABLE.
THAT IS KEY.

13:12.467 --> 13:14.733
AND ANOTHER THING--
IF SHE COMES OVER TO YOUR HOUSE

13:14.733 --> 13:17.033
AND STARTS SNOOPING
AROUND YOUR REFRIGERATOR,

13:17.033 --> 13:18.567
YOU PULL HER
THE HELL OUT OF THERE.

13:18.567 --> 13:21.200
- RIGHT, BECAUSE
IT'S MY REFRIGERATOR.

13:21.200 --> 13:23.000
- YES! THIS IS SO GREAT,

13:23.000 --> 13:25.067
BECAUSE YOU CAN NIP THIS
IN THE BUD,

13:25.067 --> 13:26.933
AND I AM GOING TO BE
RIGHT BEHIND YOU.

13:26.933 --> 13:28.267
- WE CAN HELP EACH OTHER.

13:28.267 --> 13:31.700
- I'M HAVING CHEST PAINS.

13:44.700 --> 13:47.067
- YOU GET MY SHRAPNEL?

13:47.067 --> 13:48.400
- SHH!

13:48.400 --> 13:49.667
LISTEN, DAD,
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

13:49.667 --> 13:50.900
I NEED YOUR HELP.

13:50.900 --> 13:54.333
THE LADIES,
THEY'RE PLANNING A TAKEOVER.

13:55.933 --> 13:58.800
- GO ON.

13:58.800 --> 14:00.033
- DEBRA, SHE SAW WHAT HAPPENED

14:00.033 --> 14:01.433
WITH AMY AND MOM
AND THE THANK-YOU NOTES,

14:01.433 --> 14:03.467
AND SHE GOT AMY
TO JOIN FORCES WITH HER,

14:03.467 --> 14:07.200
AND NOW DEBRA'S
ALL FOAMING AT THE MOUTH.

14:07.200 --> 14:10.800
- WAIT A MINUTE.
THIS IS BAD NEWS FOR ME.

14:10.800 --> 14:13.400
ANYTHING THAT PUTS THE MISSUS
IN A WORSE MOOD THAN USUAL

14:13.400 --> 14:16.133
PUTS ME IN THE DUMPER.

14:16.133 --> 14:19.600
WHO'S GONNA FEED ME
IF THIS HAPPENS?

14:19.600 --> 14:24.467
DEBRA?
THAT'S NO KIND OF LIFE.

14:24.467 --> 14:26.833
HOW'S AMY'S COOKING?

14:26.833 --> 14:28.633
- I DON'T KNOW.
IT'S GOOD, I GUESS.

14:28.633 --> 14:31.500
- STILL,
IT'S A TEN-MINUTE DRIVE.

14:31.500 --> 14:33.067
YOU GOT TO SHUT
THIS DOWN, RAY.

14:33.067 --> 14:34.367
HOW ARE THEY GONNA
PULL IT OFF?

14:34.367 --> 14:35.733
- IT'S ALREADY STARTED.

14:35.733 --> 14:37.567
THEY'RE PLANNING, LIKE,
A BIG THROW-DOWN,

14:37.567 --> 14:40.033
LAYING OUT THE NEW ORDER,
AND--AND EVERYBODY'S EQUAL.

14:40.033 --> 14:42.667
LOVE ALL AROUND,
PEACE AND HARMONY.

14:42.667 --> 14:46.467
- THOSE STUPID BROADS.

14:47.933 --> 14:49.500
YOU CAN'T OVERTHROW MARIE.

14:49.500 --> 14:51.533
BESIDES, ANY TIME YOU CUT
THE HEAD OFF SOMETHING,

14:51.533 --> 14:55.500
THE BODY STILL RUNS AROUND
BY ITSELF, ALL CRAZED-LIKE.

14:55.500 --> 14:57.833
- I KNOW! I KNOW.
THAT'S WHY I'M ASKING YOU.

14:57.833 --> 15:00.000
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.
WHAT DO YOU THINK WE SHOULD DO?

15:00.000 --> 15:03.000
- I'M NOT SURE YET.
- AAH!

15:08.633 --> 15:10.333
WHAT THE--

15:13.300 --> 15:15.033
YOU HEARD EVERYTHING?

15:15.033 --> 15:16.633
- I HEARD ENOUGH.

15:16.633 --> 15:18.800
- DID YOU KNOW
SHE WAS BACK THERE?

15:18.800 --> 15:21.733
- YES.

15:23.333 --> 15:26.067
- WELL, WHAT DID YOU
LET ME GO ON FOR?

15:26.067 --> 15:29.367
- I WANT MY SHRAPNEL BACK.

15:33.033 --> 15:35.067
- ALL RIGHT. LISTEN, MA...

15:36.300 --> 15:38.067
YOU GOT TO UNDERSTAND...

15:45.400 --> 15:46.867
- AND IF SHE OFFERS
TO DO YOUR LAUNDRY?

15:46.867 --> 15:48.033
- JUST SAY NO?

15:48.033 --> 15:49.467
- UNLESS YOU WANT
EVERYONE TO KNOW

15:49.467 --> 15:52.967
WHAT SIZE UNDERWEAR YOU HAVE
AT DINNER PARTIES.

15:52.967 --> 15:54.900
- THAT'S FUNNY. YEAH.

15:54.900 --> 15:58.167
HEY, UH, WHO WANTS TO GET
SOMETHING TO EAT?

15:58.167 --> 16:00.067
YOU KNOW, I MEAN, LIKE,
RIGHT THIS SECOND.

16:01.033 --> 16:04.000
- HELLO.

16:04.000 --> 16:05.633
- LET'S GO!
WHATEVER YOU WANT.

16:05.633 --> 16:07.333
I'M BUYING, I'M DRIVING,
AND I'M LEAVING RIGHT NOW!

16:07.333 --> 16:09.733
VROOM, VROOM, VROOM!

16:11.767 --> 16:13.333
- RAYMOND, PLEASE STAY.

16:13.333 --> 16:16.000
AFTER ALL, YOU BROUGHT SOMETHING
IMPORTANT TO MY ATTENTION.

16:24.400 --> 16:28.767
- WHERE DID YOU JUST COME FROM?

16:28.767 --> 16:30.800
- I WENT TO THE BATHROOM.

16:30.800 --> 16:33.167
- NO, YOU DIDN'T.

16:34.233 --> 16:37.233
- I'M DOING IT NOW.

16:41.700 --> 16:43.500
- I WAS SHOCKED TO HEAR
THAT YOU TWO

16:43.500 --> 16:46.933
WERE CONSPIRING
AGAINST ME IN SOME WAY.

16:46.933 --> 16:49.200
- GROUP HUG!

16:52.867 --> 16:56.067
ALL RIGHT, IT AIN'T HAPPENING;
IT'S NOT HAPPENING.

16:58.133 --> 17:02.200
- WHAT HAVE I DONE TO BRING ON
SUCH DISRESPECT?

17:03.533 --> 17:06.233
I MEAN, YOU KNOW,
IN THE ORIENT,

17:06.233 --> 17:08.333
ELDERS ARE REVERED
AND HONORED,

17:08.333 --> 17:10.633
NOT PLOTTED AGAINST.

17:10.633 --> 17:13.067
AND WHY DO YOU HAVE TO TALK
ABOUT ME BEHIND MY BACK?

17:13.067 --> 17:15.500
I'M HERE, RIGHT HERE.

17:16.633 --> 17:20.133
AND, DEBRA, WE MAY HAVE
OUR DIFFERENCES,

17:20.133 --> 17:23.567
BUT I CONSIDER YOU
MY DAUGHTER.

17:23.567 --> 17:27.233
AND, AMY, ALL I WANT IS FOR YOU
TO FEEL THE SAME WAY.

17:27.233 --> 17:31.633
I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY
YOU COULDN'T BE DIRECT WITH ME.

17:31.633 --> 17:34.033
YOU MAY NOT LIKE
WHAT I SAID BEFORE,

17:34.033 --> 17:37.333
BUT AT LEAST I SAID IT TO YOU.

17:39.433 --> 17:43.267
- YOU'RE RIGHT, MARIE.
I'M SORRY.

17:43.267 --> 17:44.800
I DON'T WANT TO START OFF
LIKE THIS.

17:44.800 --> 17:45.800
I LOVE YOU.

17:45.800 --> 17:48.233
- I LOVE YOU, HONEY.

17:54.967 --> 17:56.700
- AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

17:56.700 --> 17:59.067
I'M GONNA SIT DOWN AND START
ON THOSE THANK-YOU NOTES TODAY.

17:59.067 --> 18:00.467
- WHAT?

18:00.467 --> 18:02.333
- WHENEVER YOU GET TO IT, DEAR.
NO PRESSURE.

18:02.333 --> 18:04.033
- WAIT A MINUTE.
WAIT A MINUTE.

18:04.033 --> 18:06.233
THAT'S WHAT THIS
IS ALL ABOUT!

18:06.233 --> 18:07.967
- WHAT'S THE MATTER, DEBRA?

18:07.967 --> 18:11.233
- OH, DON'T GIVE ME THAT.
I KNOW YOU TOO WELL, MARIE.

18:11.233 --> 18:14.000
YOU COME OVER HERE
ALL RATIONAL AND NORMAL

18:14.000 --> 18:15.133
AND TELLING THE TRUTH,

18:15.133 --> 18:16.800
AND THIS SAP FELL FOR IT.

18:16.800 --> 18:19.067
- HEY!

18:19.067 --> 18:20.433
- YOU CAN'T SEE THAT?

18:20.433 --> 18:22.900
THIS IS A STRATEGY:
DIVIDE AND CONQUER.

18:22.900 --> 18:26.133
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE
TALKING ABOUT, DEBRA,

18:26.133 --> 18:29.400
BUT COULD IT BE
THAT YOU'RE A BIT JEALOUS

18:29.400 --> 18:33.367
BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO SHARE
THE SPOTLIGHT WITH AMY?

18:38.033 --> 18:41.667
- JEALOUS?
JEALOUS?

18:46.800 --> 18:48.200
- WHAT IS THIS?

18:48.200 --> 18:50.733
- VANILLA EXTRACT.

18:56.800 --> 18:59.633
- SHE JUST DID IT AGAIN, AMY!

18:59.633 --> 19:01.600
I AM PUTTING AN END
TO ALL OF THIS, DO YOU HEAR ME?

19:01.600 --> 19:03.600
I AM NOT LETTING YOU
TAKE ANOTHER ONE.

19:03.600 --> 19:05.133
AMY, DON'T YOU SEE
SHE WILL DO ANYTHING TO WIN?

19:05.133 --> 19:07.700
SHE'S THE DEVIL!

19:07.700 --> 19:09.367
- I GOT TO TELL YOU, DEB,
IT SEEMED TO ME

19:09.367 --> 19:11.533
LIKE SHE WAS BEING
VERY UP FRONT AND HONEST.

19:11.533 --> 19:15.633
- NO! NO, AMY, DON'T GO!
DON'T GO!

19:15.633 --> 19:18.767
- DEBRA, STOP IT!

19:18.767 --> 19:21.233
I CAN'T STAND ALL THIS.

19:21.233 --> 19:24.967
I'M NOT USED TO IT.
I'M NOT GOOD AT IT.

19:24.967 --> 19:26.367
I COME FROM A FAMILY

19:26.367 --> 19:30.467
THAT WOULDN'T YELL
IF THEY WERE ON FIRE.

19:30.467 --> 19:34.200
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE NOT
GONNA LIKE HEARING THIS, DEBRA,

19:34.200 --> 19:35.667
BUT I THINK RAY
WAS RIGHT BEFORE

19:35.667 --> 19:41.233
WHEN HE SAID MAYBE WE SHOULD
JUST ALL TRY BEING NICE.

19:46.800 --> 19:49.600
- SHE'S GONE.

19:50.833 --> 19:53.200
- DID YOU WANT TO SAY
SOMETHING, DEBRA?

19:53.200 --> 19:55.800
- NO, MARIE.

19:55.800 --> 19:58.667
NOTHING.

19:58.667 --> 20:01.067
JUST...

20:01.067 --> 20:04.200
I'M SORRY.

20:04.200 --> 20:09.900
- AW, NOW, DOESN'T THAT
FEEL GOOD TO SAY THAT?

20:09.900 --> 20:11.467
OH, YES.

20:15.100 --> 20:18.767
- GET OUT OF HERE!

20:18.767 --> 20:22.733
- AND I AGREE WITH EVERYTHING
YOU'VE SAID, AMY,

20:22.733 --> 20:23.933
EVERYTHING.

20:23.933 --> 20:25.367
- THANK YOU, MARIE.

20:25.367 --> 20:27.233
- AND ABOUT
THOSE THANK-YOU NOTES,

20:27.233 --> 20:29.300
I DON'T CARE
IF YOU EVER GET TO THEM.

20:29.300 --> 20:33.033
EXCEPT MAYBE ONE TO LEE AND STAN
ABOUT THE CANDLE.

20:33.033 --> 20:34.700
COULD YOU JUST DO THAT ONE?

20:34.700 --> 20:38.933
SEE, LEE CAN BE SO ANNOYING
ABOUT THINGS LIKE THIS.

20:38.933 --> 20:41.167
- NO PROBLEM, MARIE.

20:41.167 --> 20:43.867
- OH, YOU'RE AN ANGEL.

20:54.100 --> 20:56.300
- HELLO.
- OH, HI, LEE. HOW ARE YOU?

20:56.767 --> 20:58.167
- HEY, LEE.

20:58.167 --> 21:00.233
- HI. I'M ON MY WAY
TO THE SUPERMARKET,

21:00.233 --> 21:01.933
BUT I JUST HAD TO STOP BY
AND TELL YOU

21:01.933 --> 21:05.700
I GOT THE NICEST THANK-YOU NOTE
FROM THAT SWEET AMY.

21:05.700 --> 21:09.900
- OH, ISN'T THAT NICE?
WHAT DID IT SAY?

21:09.900 --> 21:11.467
- OH, IT JUST WENT ON AND ON

21:11.467 --> 21:14.800
ABOUT HOW SHE AND ROBERT
LOVE THE ORANGE CANDLE

21:14.800 --> 21:18.000
AND WILL
TREASURE IT ALWAYS.

21:18.000 --> 21:19.633
I HAVE TO TELL YOU, MARIE,

21:19.633 --> 21:23.800
WHEN YOU PICKED OUT THAT CANDLE
FOR US TO GIVE TO THEM,

21:23.800 --> 21:26.500
I WASN'T SURE ABOUT IT.

21:26.500 --> 21:29.267
BUT I AM SO SORRY
I GAVE YOU AN ARGUMENT.

21:29.267 --> 21:33.633
OBVIOUSLY YOU HAVE
WONDERFUL TASTE.

21:34.933 --> 21:36.733
- OH, THANK YOU, LEE.

21:36.733 --> 21:39.733
- THANK YOU.
I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

21:39.733 --> 21:42.133
- OKAY, BYE-BYE.

21:42.133 --> 21:45.467
[humming]
