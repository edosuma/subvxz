12:42.780 --> 12:46.365
I was thinking, you know, a
lot of different points of view

12:46.366 --> 12:48.910
allow for many perspectives.

12:48.911 --> 12:51.871
Uh, even though we examine a
lot on the show from the POV

12:51.872 --> 12:54.332
of the marginalized in this country.

12:54.333 --> 12:56.250
The black woman's voice
is very saleable right now

12:56.251 --> 12:58.336
and you know your
audience better than I do.

12:58.337 --> 13:01.506
But what I would like to know
is what would you with the title

13:01.507 --> 13:02.757
"Ugly Black Woman?"

13:02.758 --> 13:06.803
- I can sell that.
- Yeah, sure.

13:06.804 --> 13:09.555
Well, the next time you
come in to pitch, if you have

13:09.556 --> 13:12.433
'any other ideas,
please pitch those too.'

13:12.434 --> 13:15.879
My door is always open. I'd
love to be in business with you.

13:24.989 --> 13:26.572
Mary Jane, do you have a minute?

13:26.573 --> 13:27.991
I'm late for my meeting.

13:27.992 --> 13:29.701
Well, that's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

13:29.702 --> 13:31.410
Let's walk 'n talk.

13:31.411 --> 13:34.873
I heard you're revamping
"Talkback" and I want in.

13:34.874 --> 13:37.083
I would love to bring
the Hispanic point of view

13:37.084 --> 13:39.627
or a guest pundit, whatever.

13:39.628 --> 13:42.296
I wanna be a part of the team.

13:42.297 --> 13:44.340
I'm not looking for on-air talent.

13:44.341 --> 13:47.134
Then let me be a part
of your producing team.

13:47.135 --> 13:49.303
Marisol, if you would
have come to me earlier...

13:49.304 --> 13:51.915
What little money I had, I spent.

13:53.225 --> 13:56.503
You'll get something, okay? Don't worry.

14:07.656 --> 14:10.309
- Hey.
- Hey.

14:16.415 --> 14:19.485
Okay, we've got a lot
to do. Let's get started.

14:21.545 --> 14:23.046
Guys, this is Nina.

14:23.047 --> 14:25.048
- She's joining our Think Tank.
- Hey.

14:25.049 --> 14:28.118
Lance here is our show's producer.

14:28.844 --> 14:31.345
- Hey.
- This here is Young Jin.

14:31.346 --> 14:34.390
Our associate producer,
we snagged him from CNN.

14:34.391 --> 14:36.017
Ooh.

14:36.018 --> 14:37.268
And, guys, it took a lot of work

14:37.269 --> 14:41.022
but I somehow managed to convince Nina

14:41.023 --> 14:43.608
to join us as a news consultant.

14:43.609 --> 14:45.777
She's what, 19, 20?

14:45.778 --> 14:47.987
She's over here and I'm 21.

14:47.988 --> 14:50.281
Oh, that's only four
years younger than I am.

14:50.282 --> 14:53.076
Demographically-speaking, don't
you think that's redundant?

14:53.077 --> 14:54.744
Yeah, demographically-speaking?

14:54.745 --> 14:56.746
Trust me, you both offer
a unique point-of-view

14:56.747 --> 14:58.414
to the process, okay?

14:58.415 --> 15:00.666
Are you kidding me?

15:00.667 --> 15:02.668
You hired her?

15:02.669 --> 15:04.336
- What are you even doing here?
- Not getting coffee.

15:04.337 --> 15:06.213
- I can tell you that much.
- 'Okay, okay.'

15:06.214 --> 15:08.466
So what does she bring to
the table that I don't have?

15:08.467 --> 15:09.717
Let's break that down.

15:09.718 --> 15:11.260
Let's start with
intelligence, compassion

15:11.261 --> 15:13.763
insight, estrogen,
real-life experience.

15:13.764 --> 15:16.182
Khalil, until two minutes
ago, you were pretty thrilled

15:16.183 --> 15:17.516
to be starting an internship here.

15:17.517 --> 15:21.629
Now unless that's no
longer the case, you can go.

15:24.024 --> 15:26.426
Up to you. Are you in or out?

15:27.736 --> 15:30.571
- I'm, I'm in.
- Good.

15:30.572 --> 15:32.406
Finish passing out the
coffee, open up your laptop

15:32.407 --> 15:33.741
and start taking some notes.

15:33.742 --> 15:35.660
Nina, I didn't know
what you liked to drink

15:35.661 --> 15:36.995
so I got you a latte, is that okay?

15:36.996 --> 15:38.579
That's actually perfect. Thank you.

15:38.580 --> 15:40.315
There you go.

15:49.008 --> 15:51.634
Alright, let's get started.

15:51.635 --> 15:53.761
Due to the new format, we had
to trim the fat and roll with

15:53.762 --> 15:55.888
a skeleton crew, which
is why all of your voices

15:55.889 --> 15:57.348
are vitally important.

15:57.349 --> 15:59.017
'So don't go getting bashful on me now.'

15:59.018 --> 16:00.434
'You're all here for a reason.'

16:00.435 --> 16:03.229
'I expect each of your
voices to be heard.'

16:03.230 --> 16:05.773
Ideally, they want me on
air as soon as possible

16:05.774 --> 16:08.151
but it's gotta be right, so...

16:08.152 --> 16:11.196
Hi. Are you guys finishing up in here?

16:11.197 --> 16:13.572
No, we're actually just getting started.

16:13.573 --> 16:14.866
Oh.

16:14.867 --> 16:16.325
The "Bradley Hour" or whatever

16:16.326 --> 16:17.493
you guys are being called,
you guys have the room?

16:17.494 --> 16:19.578
Yes, we do. I'm sorry.

16:19.579 --> 16:21.288
No, no, don't apologize.

16:21.289 --> 16:23.191
Let's pack up, guys.

16:24.084 --> 16:27.336
I know it's not perfect, but...

16:27.337 --> 16:29.697
No, it's fine. Oh, okay.

16:31.133 --> 16:32.800
- You were saying.
- 'So, basically.'

16:32.801 --> 16:35.386
'Nearly 52 percent of all
single mothers in the US'

16:35.387 --> 16:37.555
live in extreme poverty,
so, a single mother

16:37.556 --> 16:39.473
'raising two kids on
ninety-nine hundred dol... '

16:39.474 --> 16:41.709
This isn't working. Let's go.

16:42.895 --> 16:44.687
Wow, you make taking
government assistance

16:44.688 --> 16:46.355
sound like a death sentence.

16:46.356 --> 16:49.650
No, what I'm saying is how can
people justify taking it at all?

16:49.651 --> 16:51.069
Uh-huh.

16:51.070 --> 16:52.278
It's been statistically proven that

16:52.279 --> 16:53.946
a certain demographic of people...

16:53.947 --> 16:55.990
Yes, yes, say it. No,
say what you're thinking.

16:55.991 --> 16:57.283
Black people, right?

16:57.284 --> 16:58.951
I mean, that's the demographic you keep

16:58.952 --> 17:00.452
dancing around, isn't it?

17:00.453 --> 17:02.038
- If I'm being honest.
- 'Uh-huh?'

17:02.039 --> 17:04.165
- Yes.
- Oh, okay.

17:04.165 --> 17:07.501
Well, then, it's actually
Caucasian women who receive

17:07.502 --> 17:09.795
the most assistance, but I
guess that's beside the point.

17:09.796 --> 17:12.257
Boom! But ain't nobody talking
about that though, are they?

17:12.258 --> 17:16.551
All I'm saying is that
Asians typically don't.

17:16.553 --> 17:18.596
My parents had to work for
every cent that they earned.

17:18.597 --> 17:20.765
- And we have never taken a...
- And mine didn't?

17:20.766 --> 17:23.226
My point is we never took a free handout

17:23.227 --> 17:24.727
not once, even when we needed it.

17:24.728 --> 17:27.230
Okay, and my point is that
you assume that we did.

17:27.231 --> 17:29.523
'I mean, you think you know
me because of the color'

17:29.524 --> 17:31.025
of my skin, right?

17:31.026 --> 17:32.277
Well, you don't know me.

17:32.278 --> 17:33.778
You see, my mother is a professor

17:33.779 --> 17:35.362
my father is a lawyer

17:35.363 --> 17:38.365
and we can pay our bills just
fine, thank you very much.

17:38.366 --> 17:41.702
But, hey, I guess because I'm
black and I wear my hair natural

17:41.703 --> 17:43.288
I must be on welfare, right?

17:43.289 --> 17:45.331
- 'Love it.'
- Very mature.

17:45.332 --> 17:46.874
Thank you.

17:46.875 --> 17:48.042
Two people speaking their truth.

17:48.043 --> 17:49.794
That's what it's all about, right?

17:49.795 --> 17:51.837
And as we all know, people
fall for all kinds of reasons.

17:51.838 --> 17:54.799
They-they fall for
desperation, addiction

17:54.800 --> 17:56.717
heartache, loss of employment.

17:56.718 --> 17:59.595
'But none of these things
are ever as important'

17:59.596 --> 18:02.723
or as powerful as the
person behind it, right?

18:02.724 --> 18:04.767
'That's what's gonna
make this show different.'

18:04.768 --> 18:07.478
Because as we delve
deeper into those stories

18:07.479 --> 18:11.065
we always have to factor
in a person's history

18:11.066 --> 18:13.318
and their motivation, because facts

18:13.319 --> 18:15.611
are all about perception, right?

18:15.612 --> 18:18.614
So someone's emotions
and-and their passions

18:18.615 --> 18:21.367
those things are gonna
allow us and our viewers

18:21.368 --> 18:24.620
the chance to see the real truth

18:24.621 --> 18:25.955
behind their stories.

18:25.956 --> 18:28.624
- Alright.
- Right, verdict?

18:28.625 --> 18:30.335
We are pitching Greg
a Show on "Welfare ."

18:30.336 --> 18:31.502
Khalil, put it up on the board.

18:31.503 --> 18:33.963
- Yes!
- 'Whoo!'

18:33.964 --> 18:35.006
Good to have you back, Mary Jane.

18:35.007 --> 18:37.091
Oh, good to be back.

18:37.092 --> 18:38.425
I'm afraid to talk
about small businesses

18:38.426 --> 18:40.094
in black communities with this group.

18:40.095 --> 18:41.929
- Let's do it.
- Let's go.

18:41.930 --> 18:43.831

you for an easy favor.</i>

18:50.563 --> 18:51.772
What?

18:51.773 --> 18:53.191
An appearance from you would bring some

18:53.192 --> 18:55.151
much-needed business to the bookstore.

18:55.152 --> 18:57.528
Cece, there are steps you have to take

18:57.529 --> 19:00.489
in order to book me and
I get photo approval.

19:00.490 --> 19:02.658
Why are you fighting our friendship?

19:02.659 --> 19:04.202
I mean, this could just be two friends

19:04.203 --> 19:05.536
doing each other a favor.

19:05.537 --> 19:07.579
I'm not asking you
for any of your money.

19:07.580 --> 19:09.456
I'm just asking you
for some of your time

19:09.457 --> 19:12.084
uses of your celebrity,
so you can encourage

19:12.085 --> 19:14.337
a few black people to read.

19:14.338 --> 19:19.409
Plus, you can keep your cool
points in the hood, you know?

19:20.135 --> 19:25.264
Please? Come on, Mary Jane. Please!

19:25.265 --> 19:26.807
Don't make me get on my knees.

19:26.808 --> 19:31.145
You know when I get on my
knees, it ain't for beggin'.

19:31.146 --> 19:34.148
Okay. Okay. Fine. Yes, I will do it.

19:34.149 --> 19:36.525
- Oh!
- Now you've gotta go.

19:36.526 --> 19:38.903
Oh, see, you're a blessing. I'm
telling you, you're my friend.

19:38.904 --> 19:40.888
Mm-hmm.

19:42.615 --> 19:44.783
So, what's going on in here?

19:44.784 --> 19:48.413
A regular Brain Trust and some
good-smelling Chinese food.

19:48.414 --> 19:50.982
Let me get one of these eggrolls.

19:53.668 --> 19:55.961
Oh, you're workin'
on your new show, huh?

19:55.962 --> 19:57.922
Yeah, uh, we got green-lit.

19:57.923 --> 19:59.757
We don't have a launch date yet, but...

19:59.758 --> 20:01.092
Cece, do you mind taking
that eggroll to go?

20:01.093 --> 20:02.843
'Cause we're kind of busy.

20:02.844 --> 20:05.763
So, what's the format? You're
goin' straight news? Panel?

20:05.764 --> 20:09.100
It's a multi-platform
conversation for pop culture

20:09.101 --> 20:11.310
social engagement,
hard-hitting news with, um

20:11.311 --> 20:13.729
an opening stand up and
then a panel discussion.

20:13.730 --> 20:15.440
CECE: 'Oh. Oh. Oh.'

20:15.441 --> 20:18.984
For a room full of smart people,
y'all sure are predictable.

20:18.985 --> 20:21.362
Predict... How are we predictable?

20:21.363 --> 20:24.365
Well, most of the topics you're tackling

20:24.366 --> 20:26.284
not only have a racial divide

20:26.285 --> 20:28.786
but a gender, a geographical

20:28.787 --> 20:32.498
a socio-economic hell,
a generational divide.

20:32.499 --> 20:37.128
Now to balance out the youth movement

20:37.129 --> 20:38.629
what you're gonna need in this show

20:38.630 --> 20:41.466
is a Dick Gregory, a Harry Belafonte

20:41.467 --> 20:44.551
or Dorothy Cotton, one
of the living legends.

20:44.552 --> 20:48.806
You see what I'm saying?
Write that down, baby.

20:48.807 --> 20:51.976
Let's get that knowledge out
of them before they die, y'all.

20:51.977 --> 20:55.438

21:10.787 --> 21:12.997

Rican girl from the Bronx

31:45.013 --> 31:47.974
with a gambler, but good-natured father

31:47.975 --> 31:50.184
and a mother who worked three jobs

31:50.185 --> 31:52.645
to keep a roof over our heads.

31:52.646 --> 31:54.940
And me running away from
the Bronx was like me

31:54.941 --> 31:56.733
running away from every guy that

31:56.734 --> 31:59.427
reminded me of my dad.

32:00.947 --> 32:03.640
My work ethic comes from my mother.

32:04.658 --> 32:06.785
She worked like a dog.

32:06.786 --> 32:09.203
She's my hero.

32:09.204 --> 32:12.832
And I vowed that I was
gonna have everything

32:12.833 --> 32:15.001
that my mother didn't have.

32:15.002 --> 32:20.073
I was gonna make her hard
work mean something to me.

32:20.758 --> 32:23.969
I was gonna have the best.

32:23.970 --> 32:28.332
Bussed to the best school.
Scholarship to Newhouse.

32:29.349 --> 32:32.811
They say this is the best
neighborhood in Atlanta.

32:32.812 --> 32:35.396
That's where we buy a house.

32:35.397 --> 32:38.733
They say that's the school
that the boys need to go to

32:38.734 --> 32:40.610
that's where they go to school.

32:40.611 --> 32:43.696
They say a white guy

32:43.697 --> 32:46.616
is more acceptable.

32:46.617 --> 32:49.186
He's more sophisticated.

32:51.580 --> 32:54.524
So I opened myself up to that.

32:57.628 --> 33:00.713
So I know how I got here, John.

33:00.714 --> 33:03.491

33:20.192 --> 33:23.569
how is it okay with
you to let your ambition

33:23.570 --> 33:27.239
be so low and watch me
take care of everything?

33:27.240 --> 33:29.283
Oh, I knew this modern arrangement

33:29.284 --> 33:31.828
you likely produced a segment
on, was not gonna work.

33:31.829 --> 33:33.521
Stop.

33:34.373 --> 33:37.525
Just please stop.
John, listen to me. I...

33:38.544 --> 33:42.380
I'm not asking you to fix
the life that I've created

33:42.381 --> 33:45.758
for myself or eat the
problems off my plate.

33:45.759 --> 33:48.511
I am simply asking you

33:48.512 --> 33:50.972
how you got here?

33:50.973 --> 33:53.391
You are a white man in America.

33:53.392 --> 33:55.852
You can do anything.
You can be whatever.

33:55.853 --> 33:57.854
But you are here.

33:57.855 --> 34:00.314
How did you get here?

34:00.315 --> 34:02.567
You, you should be
thanking me that I'm here.

34:02.568 --> 34:04.569
- I should be thanking you?
- 'Yeah.'

34:04.570 --> 34:08.322
If I weren't, you wouldn't
have a starring role in a life

34:08.322 --> 34:10.408
that allows you to work endlessly

34:10.409 --> 34:13.119
come and go as you please,
be a part-time mother.

34:13.120 --> 34:15.621
'You know, this is who I've always been'

34:15.621 --> 34:18.833
and I simply believed you
when you said it was enough

34:18.833 --> 34:21.710
and I had the affair when
I knew I was not enough

34:21.712 --> 34:24.338
'and I moved back in with
you when you figured out'

34:24.339 --> 34:26.799
that you didn't make enough money.

34:26.800 --> 34:28.994
That's how I got here.

34:42.608 --> 34:46.219
Thank you.

34:46.235 --> 34:48.054
Really.

34:51.324 --> 34:52.408
And you're right.

34:52.409 --> 34:55.145
Your ambition was never enough for me.

34:56.663 --> 35:00.166
But they need electricity.

So...

35:02.002 --> 35:04.211
I am gonna stop bothering you

35:04.212 --> 35:07.506

did or did not do, I'm sorry.'

35:34.377 --> 35:35.835
'I'm sure they're sorry too.'

35:35.836 --> 35:38.906
But this is your life
and you have to own it.

35:40.925 --> 35:47.039
I don't get how my dad's
issues have become my problem.

35:48.099 --> 35:50.934
I tell you that I have
a job that I finally like

35:50.935 --> 35:53.479
and the first thing that
you have to say is do better.

35:53.480 --> 35:55.939
- Like damn.
- 'Can I be honest?'

35:55.940 --> 35:58.191
Uh-huh, because you
always seem to hold back.

35:58.192 --> 36:00.319
You would have gotten
pom-poms and rah-rahs

36:00.320 --> 36:03.029
if you were telling me
this at 16 with no kids.

36:03.030 --> 36:07.075
So we're being down on Niecy?
It's like Ebola around here.

36:07.076 --> 36:09.161
- Grow up, Niecy.
- I got a job.

36:09.162 --> 36:11.579
No, grow up at the rate it takes to feed

36:11.580 --> 36:12.789
and house and care for your children.

36:12.790 --> 36:15.250
Grow up at that rate.

36:15.251 --> 36:16.918
Right, making minimum
wage at 20 hours a week

36:16.919 --> 36:18.670
that's not gonna cut it.

36:18.671 --> 36:20.547
Look, I'm sorry you didn't get a parade

36:20.548 --> 36:22.174
for that, but you just heard them

36:22.175 --> 36:24.092
it's time for folks to
get up out their house.

36:24.093 --> 36:27.929
Says the man who just moved out
of his mama and daddy's house.

36:27.930 --> 36:30.015
Damn it, Niecy, God, you...

36:30.016 --> 36:31.517
I found him!

36:31.518 --> 36:35.395
I'm the one who found him
when he overdosed. That was me.

36:35.396 --> 36:37.730
I had to see that, right?

36:37.731 --> 36:41.276
Him trying to be a
better father for D'Asia

36:41.277 --> 36:42.694
is supposed to be for me.

36:42.695 --> 36:44.779
I made the phone call.

36:44.780 --> 36:47.615
I asked grandpa to help us.

36:47.616 --> 36:49.826
That was me.

36:49.827 --> 36:51.453
I asked for help.

36:51.454 --> 36:53.705
I don't know what y'all
want from me, but I'm trying.

36:53.706 --> 36:55.541
- Okay. Okay.
- I'm trying.

36:55.542 --> 36:58.751
I got you. I got you. I got you.

36:58.752 --> 37:01.238
I got you. I'll help you.

37:01.589 --> 37:03.449
(SIGHS)

37:04.467 --> 37:08.428
I just feel like my
life never goes anywhere.

37:08.429 --> 37:11.457
That's because you're waiting
for somebody to rescue you.

37:12.933 --> 37:17.604
But you got this, alright,
and you have support.

37:17.605 --> 37:19.214
Use it.

37:20.525 --> 37:23.776
Look, people can help you, but
they're not gonna rescue you.

37:23.777 --> 37:25.945
Know the difference
before it's too late.

37:25.946 --> 37:29.115
You know, uncle is willing to help

37:29.116 --> 37:31.727
put you on a two-year plan
to get on with your life.

37:34.205 --> 37:36.039
The first thing you're gonna do
is you're gonna start asking for

37:36.040 --> 37:39.568
more help from Cameron's
family and Dante's family.

37:40.587 --> 37:43.296
Then we'll enroll you
in some type of school.

37:43.297 --> 37:44.881
Okay, well, I know I wanna do hair.

37:44.882 --> 37:48.676
Okay, then we'll get
you a license to do hair.

37:48.677 --> 37:51.888
I'll cover daycare for Bill
and preschool for Trayvion

37:51.889 --> 37:55.725
and then, maybe

37:55.726 --> 37:57.810
we'll get you a car.

37:57.811 --> 37:59.479
Yeah, and then we'll start, you know

37:59.480 --> 38:01.314
working on building your credit up.

38:01.315 --> 38:03.358
Yeah, but wouldn't it be easier

38:03.359 --> 38:05.527
if I just came to California with you?

38:05.528 --> 38:07.279
Oh, hell, no.

38:07.280 --> 38:10.198
You're trippin'. No, see, I've
already got my situation...

38:10.199 --> 38:12.451
- Why?

39:30.863 --> 39:32.822
No.

39:32.823 --> 39:35.116
Okay, I apologize.

39:35.117 --> 39:38.119
I saw the official
announcement of "Talkback"

39:38.120 --> 39:39.579
and congratulations.

39:39.580 --> 39:41.914
Thank you, thank you,
yeah, Greg loved the pitch

39:41.915 --> 39:44.125
and told me to go on
ahead and announce it

39:44.126 --> 39:46.002
so we're back on air next week.

39:46.003 --> 39:50.632
Oh, well, I must admit
it feels good to know

39:50.633 --> 39:53.385
that I contributed to your success.

39:53.386 --> 39:55.345
Girl, you got two shows.

39:55.346 --> 39:59.349
- Don't share down ability.
- Exactly.

39:59.350 --> 40:01.934
And I just wanted to know...

40:01.935 --> 40:04.688
what kind of
compensation might a woman

40:04.689 --> 40:08.525
who has made such valuable contributions

40:08.526 --> 40:11.845
expect in a situation such as this?

40:12.572 --> 40:14.280
Are you for real right now?

40:14.281 --> 40:16.199
What happened to "Oh,
we're just two girlfriends

40:16.200 --> 40:17.617
"doing each other favors?"

40:17.618 --> 40:20.078
Come on, bae.

40:20.079 --> 40:22.955
Ain't nobody that friendly.

40:22.956 --> 40:26.443
A woman's gotta eat, don't she?
