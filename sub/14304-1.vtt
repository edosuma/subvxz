Guess who!
It's me, Star.

00:50.718 --> 00:53.385
I have some exciting news
for you.

00:53.387 --> 00:55.354
Well, first, Marco
got kidnapped,

00:55.356 --> 00:57.656
and then I blew up
a bunch of stuff,

00:57.658 --> 00:59.491
including my wand.

00:59.493 --> 01:01.226
And I was super bummed
because I thought

01:01.228 --> 01:02.728
I was never gonna get
to do magic again,

01:02.730 --> 01:05.731
but then, I got
my new wa...

01:08.001 --> 01:09.768
My new wand!

01:09.770 --> 01:11.603
Oh, yeah,
and Marco's okay.

01:11.605 --> 01:13.439
Say hi, Marco.

01:13.441 --> 01:14.573
Hey!

01:17.744 --> 01:20.245
I don't want the computer
to watch me shower.

01:20.247 --> 01:21.847
( gasps )

01:23.583 --> 01:25.584
- What's up with
your wand?
- I don't know.

01:25.586 --> 01:27.719
Oh, no, it's going
downstairs.

01:27.721 --> 01:29.588
( yells )

01:29.590 --> 01:31.256
I almost died.

01:36.563 --> 01:37.963
My towel!

01:37.965 --> 01:39.731
Hang on.
I'll get you out.

01:39.733 --> 01:40.966
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wait a second.

01:40.968 --> 01:43.235
- I'm not decent.
- Oh, okay.

01:43.237 --> 01:44.603
Don't open that.

01:44.605 --> 01:46.205
Wasn't gonna.

01:49.776 --> 01:51.210
Uh, it's locked.

01:51.212 --> 01:52.811
What?!

01:54.981 --> 01:56.815
Try the knob.

01:56.817 --> 01:58.750
What do you think
I am doing?

01:58.752 --> 02:00.786
No, no, not now,
sweetie.

02:00.788 --> 02:02.788
I usually open
this door with my wand.

02:02.790 --> 02:06.058
Well, your book ate it.

02:06.060 --> 02:08.060
Better not be
pokin' around in there.

02:08.062 --> 02:09.962
That's my secrets closet.
It's private.

02:09.964 --> 02:11.396
Just get me outta here.

02:11.398 --> 02:12.731
( straining )

02:17.504 --> 02:19.271
What are you doing?

02:19.273 --> 02:21.006
Uh, hey, Glossaryck.

02:21.008 --> 02:22.641
My wand's locked
in the closet.

02:22.643 --> 02:24.476
Hey, what about me?

02:24.478 --> 02:26.612
Oh, yeah. Marco's
in there, too.

02:26.614 --> 02:28.313
And my spell book.

02:28.315 --> 02:30.682
Basically all my stuff.
I want my stuff.

02:30.684 --> 02:31.850
Did you try the knob?

02:31.852 --> 02:33.919
I tried
the knob.

02:37.991 --> 02:39.324
Anything?

02:41.794 --> 02:43.028
Nope. Still locked.

02:43.030 --> 02:45.030
Aha! What's going on?

02:45.032 --> 02:47.366
Is this some kind
of training thing
or something?

02:47.368 --> 02:49.835
Are you some kind
of training thing?
Are you mad?

02:49.837 --> 02:51.870
Is this wolf-kabob rock bandage
ba-ba-bandage --

02:51.872 --> 02:53.505
Stop, stop. Stop it!

02:53.507 --> 02:55.007
Just tell me how
to get out of here.

02:55.009 --> 02:56.675
Okay, I'll tell you
what to do.

02:56.677 --> 02:59.311
- Are you listening?
- Yes, I'm listening.

02:59.313 --> 03:02.814
To reach the chunks
in the hobo stew,

03:02.816 --> 03:05.050
find her secret.
That's the clue.

03:05.052 --> 03:08.687
So if I find her secret,
the door's just gonna
magically open?

03:08.689 --> 03:10.722
Good-bye!

03:12.058 --> 03:13.725
Secret?

03:15.795 --> 03:17.296
Which one?

03:17.298 --> 03:19.965
Here we go.

03:24.070 --> 03:25.871
Why don't you try
the easy way

03:25.873 --> 03:27.472
and open the door
with magic?

03:27.474 --> 03:29.241
I can't do magic.
My wand's in the closet.

03:29.243 --> 03:30.809
( gasps )

03:30.811 --> 03:32.878
Do you wanna try
the hard way?

03:32.880 --> 03:34.913
Yeah!

03:34.915 --> 03:37.082
What's the hard way?

03:37.084 --> 03:39.318
You've never heard
of the hard way?

03:39.320 --> 03:40.752
Nope. Sounds hard though.

03:40.754 --> 03:43.388
Oh, it is.
But I can teach you.

03:43.390 --> 03:45.757
Teach me.

03:45.759 --> 03:49.661
The lesson begins
inside my eyeball.

03:51.431 --> 03:54.833
Imagine the universe
as this big old cauldron,

03:54.835 --> 03:58.237
and magic is
the bubbly stew inside,

03:58.239 --> 04:01.073
and your wand is the spoon.
And now...

04:01.075 --> 04:03.342
My wand isn't a spoon.
It's a wand.

04:03.344 --> 04:05.544
It's a metaphor, Star.

04:05.546 --> 04:07.179
No, it's a wand.

04:07.181 --> 04:09.781
Fine. It's a wand.

04:09.783 --> 04:11.116
Now you're getting it.

04:11.118 --> 04:13.185
Now the wand can only
skim the surface

04:13.187 --> 04:16.021
of the hobo gravy,
watery and brown.

04:16.023 --> 04:19.191
But if you want
to get to the chunks,

04:19.193 --> 04:21.793
you've got to dip down.

04:23.796 --> 04:25.197
Get it?

04:26.933 --> 04:28.200
Uh-uh.

04:28.202 --> 04:30.602
Okay, look.

04:30.604 --> 04:32.137
You can do magic
without your wand.

04:32.139 --> 04:33.972
You just have to
dip down, ya know?

04:33.974 --> 04:36.541
Dip down.
<i>Dip down!</i>

04:36.543 --> 04:37.976
Without my wand?

04:37.978 --> 04:39.745
Your mom did it.

04:39.747 --> 04:41.913
Psh! If she can do it,
I can do it.

04:41.915 --> 04:44.983
Okay, I've just gotta
dip down.

04:48.621 --> 04:50.122
Hot laser!

04:51.424 --> 04:52.791
I am so sorry.

04:54.093 --> 04:56.561
Star, try dipping down...

04:56.563 --> 04:58.497
for the chunks.

04:58.499 --> 05:00.999
( whistling )

05:01.001 --> 05:02.801
Ow!

05:02.803 --> 05:05.704
Ah, Marco my boy.
How's it going over there?

05:07.073 --> 05:09.908
Oh, you know, just trying
to find her "secrets"

05:09.910 --> 05:11.643
in a closet full of secrets!

05:11.645 --> 05:15.080
Yes, well, you know
I do this because I love you.

05:15.082 --> 05:16.315
Okay, that's
a little weird.

05:16.317 --> 05:18.750
I'm sure it is.

05:18.752 --> 05:19.918
Now if you don't mind,

05:19.920 --> 05:21.820
I've got work to do.

05:21.822 --> 05:24.089
Yeah. So do I.

05:24.091 --> 05:26.925
Help... me!

05:26.927 --> 05:29.861
- ( screams )
- Hmm.

05:34.200 --> 05:35.867
( whistles )

05:48.014 --> 05:50.782
You ever dip down
before, Sajak?

05:52.118 --> 05:53.952
Yeah, me neither.

05:53.954 --> 05:56.221
What a mess.

05:56.223 --> 05:58.357
It's time to get organized.

06:04.497 --> 06:06.031
No.

06:08.134 --> 06:09.801
No!

06:09.803 --> 06:12.504
Dip down, dip down,
dip down, dip down.

06:12.506 --> 06:15.707
Dip down, dip down, dip
down, dip down, dip down.

06:15.709 --> 06:17.976
Dip  <i>down!</i>

06:17.978 --> 06:21.079
<i>Down!!</i>

06:24.517 --> 06:27.052
Aquarium blast!

06:28.354 --> 06:31.223
Fish blast.
Are you okay?

06:37.363 --> 06:39.731
Dip down.

06:44.103 --> 06:46.004
Dip down.

06:54.080 --> 06:55.247
Nope.

06:57.917 --> 07:00.085
( Marco screaming )
They're biting me!

07:00.087 --> 07:01.586
That didn't work.

07:01.588 --> 07:03.088
Stop eating
my flesh.

07:06.426 --> 07:07.626
Hmmm.

07:07.628 --> 07:10.862
Hmm. Hmm. Hmmmmm.

07:14.767 --> 07:16.635
( exhales )

07:16.637 --> 07:18.937
Ahem. Call Mom.

07:20.773 --> 07:22.207
Star?

07:22.209 --> 07:23.942
Hi, Mommy.

07:23.944 --> 07:25.744
What did you do?

07:25.746 --> 07:28.947
( stammering )

07:28.949 --> 07:31.950
Okay, Marco's locked
in my closet,

07:31.952 --> 07:34.085
and Glossaryck wants me to
dip down to get him out.

07:34.087 --> 07:35.954
Dip down?

07:35.956 --> 07:38.390
I didn't learn that
until I was 19.

07:38.392 --> 07:44.496
Wow! So I'm, like,
advanced.

07:44.498 --> 07:45.964
( chuckling )

07:45.966 --> 07:48.066
I suppose.

07:48.068 --> 07:52.404
Anyway, Glossaryck didn't really
give me any instructions, so...

07:52.406 --> 07:55.173
Ha. That sounds familiar.

07:55.175 --> 07:56.775
Well, it's not easy.

07:56.777 --> 07:58.343
If you want to dip down,

07:58.345 --> 08:00.979
you have to summon
everything you have.

08:00.981 --> 08:03.315
Everything?!

08:03.317 --> 08:06.017
Oh!

08:06.019 --> 08:08.086
Everything.

08:08.088 --> 08:11.857
Star, you do know
what I mean by everything...

08:11.859 --> 08:13.525
Yeah, totally, totally.

08:15.528 --> 08:18.530
Okay, I think
that's everything.

08:27.106 --> 08:28.473
You want everything?

08:28.475 --> 08:31.676
Everything you shall get.

08:31.678 --> 08:34.279
Marco Diaz
makin' progress.

08:34.281 --> 08:36.281
( crashing )

08:48.461 --> 08:50.462
Okay, that's not good.

08:50.464 --> 08:53.832
Well, Marco, looks like
I'm just a skimmer.

08:53.834 --> 08:56.868
Skimmin' the surface
of the hobo gravy.

08:56.870 --> 08:58.470
The watery hobo gravy.

08:58.472 --> 09:00.872
How are things
goin' for you?

09:00.874 --> 09:02.641
Not so good.

09:02.643 --> 09:07.312
Actually, you thwarted
my progress.

09:07.314 --> 09:09.381
I guess
it's not that bad.

09:09.383 --> 09:11.716
I can slide sandwiches
under the door.

09:11.718 --> 09:13.051
Bring you your homework.

09:13.053 --> 09:14.686
Life could be good for you.

09:14.688 --> 09:17.222
I don't wanna live
in your secrets closet.

09:20.693 --> 09:22.494
( yells )

09:22.496 --> 09:24.529
All right.

09:24.531 --> 09:26.164
No more riddles,
little man.

09:26.166 --> 09:28.333
Tell me what I'm
supposed to be looking for.

09:28.335 --> 09:29.801
My eyes!

09:34.073 --> 09:37.108
Oh! So this is
the thing.

09:37.110 --> 09:39.177
Bingo.

09:39.179 --> 09:40.712
Star, I found the thing.

09:40.714 --> 09:42.514
It's a little book.

09:42.516 --> 09:43.882
That's good.

09:43.884 --> 09:46.017
Reading will keep
the mind sharp.

09:46.019 --> 09:47.252
Like a horn.

09:47.254 --> 09:49.354
It's in
Mewnian writing.

09:49.356 --> 09:51.022
Oh, wait,
here's English.

09:51.024 --> 09:53.191
"Chapter one.
Mom's a poop head."

09:53.193 --> 09:55.193
Mom's a poop head?

09:55.195 --> 09:56.962
Marco, no.
No, no, no, no, no!

09:56.964 --> 09:58.463
Hang on, Star.
Just give me a sec.

09:58.465 --> 10:00.131
Marco, no.
That's not the thing.

10:00.133 --> 10:01.633
- That's not the thing!
- Skipping forward.

10:01.635 --> 10:04.102
- Marco, put that down!
- "On my tenth birthday,

10:04.104 --> 10:06.104
I put noxie frogs in
all the servants' beds."

10:06.106 --> 10:07.872
Hey.

10:07.874 --> 10:09.441
I'm out of juice.

10:09.443 --> 10:11.176
Dip down!

10:12.712 --> 10:14.713
Marco, it's not the thing,
it's not the thing!

10:14.715 --> 10:18.116
"Chapter 11,
my thoughts on...

10:18.118 --> 10:19.317
Marco."

10:19.319 --> 10:20.652
( gasps )

10:20.654 --> 10:23.221
Dip down.

10:37.570 --> 10:39.971
I did it!

10:39.973 --> 10:41.640
I dipped, I dipped,
I dipped, Marco!

10:41.642 --> 10:43.942
I'm not a skimmer.
I dipped!

10:43.944 --> 10:45.744
Ow!

10:45.746 --> 10:47.712
Sorry. But don't
read my journal.

10:51.317 --> 10:53.184
Well, this thing's
broken,

10:53.186 --> 10:54.653
but give it a whirl.

10:59.158 --> 11:01.359
Uh...

11:01.361 --> 11:03.662
I'm gonna go
put on some pants.

11:03.664 --> 11:05.330
Uh...

11:05.332 --> 11:07.298
( coughs )

11:07.300 --> 11:09.367
I call dibs on
the new tower.

11:21.180 --> 11:22.614
Where is my castle?

11:22.616 --> 11:24.215
It's gone.

11:24.217 --> 11:26.651
And where is
your wand?

11:26.653 --> 11:28.153
That's gone, too.

11:28.155 --> 11:30.221
Everything?

11:30.223 --> 11:32.290
We are no longer friends!

11:32.292 --> 11:33.391
We never were friends.

11:33.393 --> 11:36.728
You are now
my mortal enemy.

11:36.730 --> 11:39.431
This day, I vow...

11:41.167 --> 11:44.169
( screaming )

11:44.171 --> 11:46.304
( screaming continues )

11:56.982 --> 11:59.217
Adrift in the universe

11:59.219 --> 12:02.353
that is infinitely expanding.

12:02.355 --> 12:05.490
Toward nothing...

12:05.492 --> 12:08.393
away from nothing.

12:08.395 --> 12:12.664
A passage of time
marked by age.

12:12.666 --> 12:16.201
Marked by hunger
of the spirit.

12:16.203 --> 12:18.870
And hunger...

12:18.872 --> 12:21.406
of the body.

12:21.408 --> 12:24.042
Alone.

12:24.044 --> 12:26.678
Infinitely...

12:26.680 --> 12:28.880
Chips...

12:28.882 --> 12:30.381
Food...

12:30.383 --> 12:33.251
( straining )

12:33.253 --> 12:35.420
Come back.

12:46.432 --> 12:48.800
Where am I?

12:48.802 --> 12:50.068
Ow!

12:50.070 --> 12:53.705
Dirt...Ow! In my eye!

12:55.374 --> 12:59.144
The sky is throwing
water at my face.

13:03.282 --> 13:05.283
My chips!

13:05.285 --> 13:07.352
Can I please...

13:28.474 --> 13:30.508
Sushi come back.

13:30.510 --> 13:33.044
I want my sushi.

13:39.485 --> 13:41.486
Oh, yes, yes.

13:41.488 --> 13:43.188
Excuse me, brother.

13:53.098 --> 13:54.332
Lunch over?

14:01.473 --> 14:03.408
You never loved me!

14:20.826 --> 14:23.361
( stammering )

14:23.363 --> 14:26.231
( squeaking )

14:26.233 --> 14:28.733
( Ludo screaming )

14:28.735 --> 14:30.468
Please don't let me go.

14:38.344 --> 14:39.811
( straining )

14:39.813 --> 14:42.213
Don't fight it, bro.

14:42.215 --> 14:43.581
You're stuck.

14:43.583 --> 14:45.817
Just let it happen.

14:49.588 --> 14:50.989
Snow!

14:50.991 --> 14:53.291
( crying )
Snow.

14:59.265 --> 15:01.332
No, no.

15:01.334 --> 15:02.734
( spits )

15:02.736 --> 15:04.269
( laughter )

15:04.271 --> 15:06.204
You taste bad.

15:06.206 --> 15:08.339
Never mind.
I'll shut up.

15:14.847 --> 15:17.282
Oh, that's horrible.

15:17.284 --> 15:19.350
Tastes pretty good.

15:23.255 --> 15:24.589
More, please.
Please, please, please.

15:38.804 --> 15:41.039
How long have
I been asleep?

16:22.781 --> 16:25.183
Where are you going?

16:36.495 --> 16:38.162
Ow!

16:58.951 --> 17:00.618
Gotcha!

17:40.392 --> 17:41.993
My chips!

17:41.995 --> 17:43.361
My chips!

17:43.363 --> 17:44.996
( high-pitched shriek )

17:47.766 --> 17:50.435
Big mistake.

18:06.285 --> 18:07.585
Come and get me.

18:15.561 --> 18:16.961
( shrieking )

18:34.646 --> 18:37.682
Ya-ha. Uh-oh.

18:58.837 --> 19:00.905
Look out below.

19:04.176 --> 19:06.677
I win, and to the victor...

19:06.679 --> 19:10.915
the spoils!

19:41.547 --> 19:43.014
Go get it.

20:08.874 --> 20:11.676
Keep it comin'.

20:11.678 --> 20:13.844
Good.

20:13.846 --> 20:16.614
Whoa.
That's enough.

20:18.517 --> 20:20.351
You'll get
the scraps later.

20:20.353 --> 20:22.186
( screeching overhead )

20:22.188 --> 20:24.755
It's time.

20:33.999 --> 20:36.234
Hi.

20:41.940 --> 20:44.942
<i>Nature is a cruel mother.</i>

20:44.944 --> 20:49.113
<i>And favors the merciless.</i>

20:49.115 --> 20:52.450
<i>And so, in order</i>
<i>to survive,</i>

20:52.452 --> 20:56.687
<i>Ludo in the wild</i>
<i>must find</i>

20:56.689 --> 21:00.358
<i>the wild in Ludo.</i>

21:00.360 --> 21:02.126
Hey, Ludo.

21:03.962 --> 21:05.630
Hi.

21:07.633 --> 21:11.035
No, no, no.

21:11.037 --> 21:13.938
Find somebody else to...

21:13.940 --> 21:16.207
get the wand!

21:17.376 --> 21:20.311
It's mine.
It will be mine!

21:20.313 --> 21:21.846
( whistles )
Arachnid!

21:26.451 --> 21:27.852
Bird!

21:38.964 --> 21:41.165
Oh, no. No, no, no!

21:41.167 --> 21:42.833
Where'd she go?

21:42.835 --> 21:44.402
No!!

21:44.404 --> 21:46.537
Cruel vision.

22:00.852 --> 22:02.353
