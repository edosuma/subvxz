<i>Previously on</i> The Vampire Diaries:

00:03.987 --> 00:06.478
<i>For over a century,</i>
<i>I have lived in secret until now.</i>

00:06.656 --> 00:08.487
<i>I know the risk, but I have to know her.</i>

00:08.658 --> 00:11.149
- What are you?
- I'm a vampire.

00:11.327 --> 00:13.454
- You must be Ms. Pierce.
- Call me Katherine.

00:13.630 --> 00:16.531
I was never in love with you.
None of my feelings were real.

00:16.700 --> 00:19.328
Believe what you want, Stefan.
But I know the truth.

00:19.502 --> 00:21.800
- So the black sheep returns.
- Tyler?

00:21.971 --> 00:24.132
- Who's the guy with Carol?
- Mason Lockwood.

00:24.307 --> 00:26.468
Know where I could find
family artifact stuff?

00:26.643 --> 00:29.305
I'm looking for this old piece
of my mom's, a moonstone.

00:29.479 --> 00:31.140
I think the Lockwoods
have a family secret.

00:31.314 --> 00:33.475
They're not vampires.
They're something else.

00:33.683 --> 00:35.173
- The lycanthrope.
- Werewolves?

00:36.986 --> 00:38.578
It was you.

00:38.788 --> 00:41.222
I fed her blood
and Katherine obviously killed her.

00:41.424 --> 00:43.153
And A plus B equals?

00:43.326 --> 00:44.623
Because I'm starving.

00:46.663 --> 00:48.563
- Katherine.
- Don't be frightened.

00:48.798 --> 00:50.663
We're gonna have
so much fun together.

00:53.236 --> 00:56.296
Look who found his dancing shoes.

00:56.473 --> 01:00.102
Ah. No touching, Mr. Salvatore.
Those are the rules.

01:00.276 --> 01:02.744
I thought you didn't believe in rules.

01:04.714 --> 01:08.411
My brother's still upset
that you chose me to escort you.

01:08.618 --> 01:10.108
Well, Damon needs to concede...

01:10.320 --> 01:13.118
...that his younger brother
is a better dancer.

01:14.657 --> 01:19.026
Ah, looks like he found someone
to occupy his time.

01:26.369 --> 01:28.234
Elena.

01:28.404 --> 01:29.928
Stefan, don't.

01:35.145 --> 01:36.840
Elena.

01:38.000 --> 01:44.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

01:51.928 --> 01:53.293
It's your turn.

01:56.065 --> 01:58.090
Be prepared to lose.

02:01.471 --> 02:02.995
All right.

02:04.107 --> 02:05.972
It hurts, doesn't it?

02:08.578 --> 02:11.308
- Hit that one.
- Now you know how I feel.

02:13.116 --> 02:14.777
Don't fight it, Stefan.

02:14.984 --> 02:16.144
You loved me once.

02:17.754 --> 02:20.120
You can love me again.

02:23.760 --> 02:25.853
I love you, Stefan.

02:26.029 --> 02:27.394
We'll be together again.

02:28.398 --> 02:30.491
I promise.

02:42.612 --> 02:44.409
Hey. You okay?

02:44.614 --> 02:46.309
Hey.

02:46.683 --> 02:48.981
Yeah, it's just a bad dream.

02:49.786 --> 02:51.947
Go back to sleep.

02:52.121 --> 02:53.247
Mm.

03:02.665 --> 03:03.825
Katherine.

03:04.033 --> 03:06.661
You have to admit,
I am getting better at this.

03:10.940 --> 03:13.431
It was easy to get inside of your head.

03:13.643 --> 03:16.077
Have you completely
forsaken your nature?

03:19.315 --> 03:20.873
Are we gonna do this again?

03:21.084 --> 03:25.680
We both know I could rip you to shreds
and do my nails at the same time.

03:26.489 --> 03:28.889
- What do you want?
- I wanted to see you.

03:29.058 --> 03:30.685
I missed you, Stefan.

03:30.860 --> 03:32.987
Indulge me for a little while, please.

03:33.196 --> 03:35.096
Why are you back in town?

03:36.232 --> 03:40.225
Three reasons. You, you and you.

03:41.271 --> 03:43.899
See, I can't quite get that down.
It just kind of, ahem...

03:44.073 --> 03:45.131
...gets stuck in my throat.

03:45.308 --> 03:47.572
Well, you know it's the truth.

03:48.278 --> 03:50.872
Deep down inside
that gorgeous body of yours...

03:51.047 --> 03:53.709
...is the Stefan
that fell in love with me too.

04:05.128 --> 04:07.790
- What do you want?
- This is where you spend your time...

04:07.997 --> 04:10.295
...when you're not stabbing people
in the back.

04:10.533 --> 04:13.627
I tricked you into telling me the truth.
That's not stabbing you in the back.

04:13.803 --> 04:16.363
That's using your own tactics
against you.

04:16.539 --> 04:18.005
Where are you going?

04:18.207 --> 04:21.438
I made myself clear, Damon.
I want nothing to do with you.

04:22.077 --> 04:24.512
Okay. See you at Jenna's barbecue.

04:27.250 --> 04:29.377
How did you know
about Jenna's barbecue?

04:29.585 --> 04:33.453
It was my idea. Jenna went
to high school with Mason Lockwood.

04:33.656 --> 04:37.786
So I figured a social gathering would
be a good way to get to know the guy.

04:37.961 --> 04:39.929
So I told Ric to tell Jenna and...

04:40.096 --> 04:43.998
Does Jenna know you're gonna be there?
Because she's not exactly a fan of yours.

04:44.167 --> 04:45.395
Perfect. Thank you.

04:46.102 --> 04:49.936
I'm hoping this peach cobbler
will pave the way.

04:50.139 --> 04:52.107
What are you up to?

04:53.309 --> 04:57.268
I'm gonna put some silver into Mason
Lockwood and prove he's a werewolf.

04:57.447 --> 04:59.415
See you at the barbecue.

05:01.351 --> 05:04.149
- Mason, you got a second?
- No, barbecue at Jenna Sommers'.

05:04.320 --> 05:07.255
Give me two minutes, all right?
You can't keep dodging me.

05:07.457 --> 05:10.153
- I'm freaking out over here.
- Tyler.

05:10.326 --> 05:11.850
What do you want me to say, man?

05:12.061 --> 05:14.825
"Yes, I turned into a wolf.
No, it's not gonna happen to you."

05:15.064 --> 05:16.292
How do you know that?

05:16.833 --> 05:18.596
You're not gonna trigger the curse.

05:18.801 --> 05:21.929
Your dad didn't know about this.
Neither did I until it happened.

05:22.138 --> 05:24.902
- How does it get triggered?
- Ignorance is bliss, trust me.

05:25.074 --> 05:27.542
You blow back into town
with some supernatural family secret...

05:27.710 --> 05:29.177
...and expect me
not to ask questions?

05:29.345 --> 05:32.337
I can't say anything more. Sorry, Tyler.

05:33.149 --> 05:35.617
It's just better for you if I don't.

05:41.791 --> 05:44.453
You ever find that moonstone?

05:45.028 --> 05:46.655
Do you know where it is?

05:46.829 --> 05:48.956
- What's so special about it?
- I told you.

05:49.165 --> 05:51.895
It was my mom's. It's sentimental.

05:52.835 --> 05:54.735
- Look, just don't worry about it.
- Yeah.

05:54.971 --> 05:57.371
Forget I even brought it up, all right?

05:58.875 --> 06:00.399
I'll see you later.

06:10.620 --> 06:13.180
You shouldn't read someone's journal.

06:13.356 --> 06:14.914
I know, I'm sorry.

06:15.124 --> 06:16.386
It was just too tempting.

06:16.626 --> 06:19.220
All of your inner thoughts
and feelings...

06:19.429 --> 06:21.556
...laying there on your desk
for me to read.

06:25.568 --> 06:27.866
Damon's private stock.

06:29.772 --> 06:33.071
That's right, you don't do human.

06:33.276 --> 06:35.039
I read that.

06:35.745 --> 06:38.509
And I also read
about your recent werewolf sighting.

06:38.681 --> 06:40.911
That must have come as a surprise.

06:41.084 --> 06:42.949
What do you know about werewolves?

06:43.653 --> 06:45.382
I know not to pet one.

06:46.789 --> 06:48.256
Their bite kills, Stefan.

06:48.658 --> 06:51.456
It's best to stay clear of them
during a full moon.

06:51.694 --> 06:52.956
And how do you know this?

06:54.097 --> 06:55.758
Who do you think was responsible...

06:55.932 --> 06:58.560
...for ridding this town
of vampires in 1864?

06:58.768 --> 07:00.099
Founding families.

07:00.670 --> 07:03.195
Spearheaded by...?

07:05.374 --> 07:07.365
The Lockwoods.

07:08.111 --> 07:11.080
You remember the Founder's Ball,
don't you?

07:11.247 --> 07:13.772
The one
that you were dreaming about?

07:14.417 --> 07:16.408
I was your escort.

07:16.919 --> 07:19.387
<i>That was before you</i>
<i>and Damon knew about my secret.</i>

07:19.555 --> 07:22.547
Everyone, will you please join me
in raising your glasses...

07:22.758 --> 07:26.159
...to my good friend
George Lockwood.

07:26.329 --> 07:29.298
George, thank you
for so bravely defending the South.

07:29.499 --> 07:30.989
My honor, Mr. Salvatore.

07:31.567 --> 07:34.092
After all, someone had to do it.

07:34.303 --> 07:36.134
Hear, hear.

07:40.643 --> 07:43.305
- May I have a word, Ms. Katherine?
- Grab a glass, Henry.

07:43.479 --> 07:45.606
- It's a celebration.
- Please, Ms. Katherine.

07:50.586 --> 07:54.488
I looked into those attacks
from the other night. It wasn't vampires.

07:55.424 --> 07:58.018
That's good news.
Means we have nothing to worry about.

07:58.227 --> 08:00.195
I'm afraid you don't understand.

08:00.363 --> 08:04.163
Those folks were torn apart
in ways I've never seen before.

08:06.435 --> 08:11.304
Then it won't be long before
the Founders draw up an investigation.

08:11.474 --> 08:13.942
We'll leave town immediately.
I'll tell the others.

08:14.110 --> 08:15.668
Relax, Henry.

08:15.845 --> 08:19.144
This town is our home
and the vampires are my family.

08:19.315 --> 08:21.112
I won't let anything happen to us.

08:26.355 --> 08:30.291
<i>From the moment I met</i>
<i>George, I knew he'd be a problem.</i>

08:32.461 --> 08:35.328
So you're saying
that all the Lockwoods are werewolves.

08:35.498 --> 08:37.898
The werewolf gene
runs in the Lockwood family.

08:38.067 --> 08:41.195
- Not that they're all wolves.
- How many werewolves are out there?

08:41.370 --> 08:44.270
I mean,
is it just limited to the Lockwoods?

08:44.774 --> 08:47.004
No. There are others.

08:47.176 --> 08:49.542
Not many. They're practically extinct.

08:49.712 --> 08:54.342
They mainly exist now
in books and really bad movies.

08:58.154 --> 09:00.679
My turn to ask a question.

09:03.426 --> 09:06.395
Why did you keep this picture?

09:09.765 --> 09:10.789
Hmm?

09:10.967 --> 09:14.562
Why not burn it? Tear it up.

09:15.238 --> 09:16.933
You wanna know why I came back?

09:17.106 --> 09:20.041
Well, I have a better question.
Why did you?

09:20.243 --> 09:22.370
For Elena?

09:22.578 --> 09:24.443
No.

09:24.847 --> 09:30.114
You came back here to fall in love
with me all over again, didn't you?

09:43.766 --> 09:47.827
What is it about you...

09:50.273 --> 09:53.106
...that makes me still care?

10:40.323 --> 10:42.518
Now, where were we?

10:45.294 --> 10:46.488
You were gonna tell me...

10:46.662 --> 10:49.096
...why you came back
to Mystic Falls, weren't you?

10:49.265 --> 10:51.631
- You didn't have to do this.
- Answer the question.

10:52.768 --> 10:55.259
I came back for you.

10:57.506 --> 10:59.531
Well, we're gonna play
by my rules now.

11:10.453 --> 11:12.353
No, what are you do...?

11:17.693 --> 11:19.991
Answer the question.

11:20.896 --> 11:22.227
You're gonna torture me now?

11:22.398 --> 11:25.799
I'm gonna do whatever it takes
to get you to tell me the truth.

11:28.971 --> 11:30.905
Later that night,
at the Founder's Ball...

11:31.073 --> 11:33.064
I don't wanna hear stories
about the past.

11:33.275 --> 11:34.367
Yes, you do, Stefan.

11:35.044 --> 11:37.342
That's exactly what you wanna hear.

11:40.516 --> 11:43.041
She's all alone.

11:43.219 --> 11:46.711
Does this mean
I can finally have you all to myself?

11:46.889 --> 11:48.823
Your father's outdone himself.

11:48.991 --> 11:52.552
Yeah, knowing Father, he'll wanna throw
a Founder's Party every year.

11:55.064 --> 11:59.501
I must admit, I am rather surprised
that you'd come looking for me.

11:59.668 --> 12:02.660
Because you're the rope
in the Salvatore brothers' tug-of-war?

12:02.838 --> 12:06.831
No, because I'm a vampire
who could kill you in your sleep.

12:08.577 --> 12:10.169
I beg your pardon?

12:10.379 --> 12:12.506
Relax, George.

12:12.681 --> 12:14.205
I know you know my secret.

12:14.417 --> 12:16.885
This conversation is over.

12:17.820 --> 12:20.880
And I know your secret too
and I know that you're extra-strong.

12:21.056 --> 12:23.115
Only not as strong.

12:29.398 --> 12:31.025
How do you know who I am?

12:31.233 --> 12:35.363
You think that I would settle into a town
without knowing my enemies?

12:36.705 --> 12:38.605
What do you want?

12:40.709 --> 12:42.108
What did he want?

12:55.558 --> 12:59.119
Thanks for letting me invite Caroline.
She could use a day of distraction.

12:59.295 --> 13:01.786
Well, she's not the plus-one
I'm worried about.

13:01.964 --> 13:03.591
Why is Damon coming?

13:04.099 --> 13:06.659
Because Alaric is a pity-taker.

13:06.902 --> 13:08.267
Come on, Jenna, be nice.

13:08.471 --> 13:12.407
I'll be nice when Damon learns
to keep his paws off of you.

13:14.610 --> 13:17.010
Aha, good news, found the shot glasses.

13:17.480 --> 13:18.845
That would be my exit.

13:19.014 --> 13:22.347
I'm here 10 minutes and I'm back
under the bleachers at the pep rally.

13:22.518 --> 13:24.247
It's just like old times, huh?

13:24.420 --> 13:27.287
Only I didn't swipe this bottle
from my old man.

13:27.823 --> 13:31.691
Oh, the expensive stuff.
I like you already.

13:31.927 --> 13:34.896
- Just happy to be invited.
- Thank Ric, this was his idea.

13:35.097 --> 13:36.121
- Really?
- Yeah.

13:36.298 --> 13:39.699
I thought it'd be nice to meet
some of Jenna's old high school friends.

13:39.935 --> 13:42.301
- Dig up a little dirt.
- Oh, I've got dirt.

13:42.471 --> 13:44.166
- I got dirt.
- I have no secrets.

13:44.406 --> 13:46.033
Only dirty shame.

13:46.208 --> 13:47.766
- To dirty shame.
- Ha, ha.

13:49.111 --> 13:51.102
- Cheers.
- Hey.

13:52.615 --> 13:54.810
- Damon.
- We're just doing shots.

13:54.984 --> 13:58.442
- Let me get you a shot glass, buddy.
- No, here.

13:58.654 --> 14:00.281
Use mine.

14:02.658 --> 14:05.218
She doesn't like me very much.

14:05.461 --> 14:07.486
We haven't met. Mason Lockwood.

14:07.696 --> 14:09.994
Oh, sure, hey. Damon Salvatore.

14:10.165 --> 14:13.293
I know. Heard great things about you.

14:13.469 --> 14:15.733
Really? That's weird.

14:15.938 --> 14:17.030
Because I'm a dick.

14:17.940 --> 14:20.033
Hey. Um, just checking in.

14:20.209 --> 14:23.940
Did you get my message
about Jenna's barbecue?

14:25.848 --> 14:28.840
- Call me when you can.
- Was that Stefan?

14:29.018 --> 14:32.510
He hasn't called me back. I'm trying
to decide if I should be worried.

14:32.688 --> 14:34.246
I'm sure he's fine.

14:35.257 --> 14:37.487
God, I cannot stop eating. Ha, ha.

14:37.860 --> 14:41.193
Stefan says it's a great way
to sublimate the cravings.

14:41.397 --> 14:44.696
You know, it's horrible,
just fighting the urge for blood...

14:44.867 --> 14:47.097
...every minute of every day.

14:48.070 --> 14:50.561
I know that Stefan
really hates that part of himself.

14:50.739 --> 14:53.867
Well, yeah. I mean, he hates
that you're a constant temptation.

14:56.078 --> 14:57.409
- He said that?
- Mm-hm.

14:57.613 --> 15:00.514
The desire to rip out your jugular
every time he's with you?

15:00.683 --> 15:02.207
Trust me, it's there.

15:02.785 --> 15:05.982
And it's why I had to break up
with Matt.

15:08.624 --> 15:11.252
Hey, the food's ready. Come get it.

15:11.427 --> 15:14.260
Finally. I'm starving.

15:18.867 --> 15:21.495
<i>You know,</i>
<i>we could sit here as long as you want.</i>

15:22.004 --> 15:27.601
And when you start to desiccate,
there's a tomb with your name on it.

15:28.577 --> 15:31.410
I've been doing all the talking.
It's your turn.

15:32.748 --> 15:35.114
Do you pretend to be human
when you're with Elena?

15:35.284 --> 15:36.308
Is that the appeal?

15:36.518 --> 15:39.316
Actually, I don't pretend to be anything
when I'm with her.

15:39.722 --> 15:42.020
That's the whole point.

15:42.224 --> 15:45.387
- I get to just be myself.
- Does she know that you love me?

15:47.730 --> 15:49.163
I don't.

15:49.331 --> 15:51.265
That's where you're wrong, Stefan.

15:53.802 --> 15:57.067
Don't you remember
bringing me home that night?

16:00.309 --> 16:01.640
<i>Your family had taken me in.</i>

16:01.810 --> 16:03.607
I had a lovely time, Stefan.

16:03.779 --> 16:06.077
How long do you plan
on staying in Mystic Falls?

16:06.248 --> 16:07.510
As long as I'm wanted.

16:07.683 --> 16:10.151
Your father has been very kind
to give me shelter.

16:10.319 --> 16:13.914
How could we not?
Losing your family in the fire.

16:14.089 --> 16:15.989
I'm grateful you made it out
of Atlanta.

16:16.759 --> 16:18.989
So I gather I'm wanted?

16:19.662 --> 16:21.493
Uh, very much so. Ha, ha.

16:25.134 --> 16:29.366
I know we've only known each other
for a short while and...

16:30.572 --> 16:32.699
And I know I'm in competition
for your affections.

16:34.376 --> 16:36.071
But, uh...

16:37.413 --> 16:41.349
...I've never met a woman
quite like you.

16:42.184 --> 16:46.177
I look at you and I see...

16:47.022 --> 16:48.956
...an angel.

16:50.125 --> 16:52.889
I touch your skin...

16:55.164 --> 16:57.997
...and my entire body ignites.

17:00.536 --> 17:05.337
I kiss you
and I know that I'm falling in love.

17:18.921 --> 17:21.048
I am in love with you.

17:21.423 --> 17:23.914
There's just so much
you don't know about me, Stefan.

17:24.859 --> 17:26.656
More to learn and love.

17:26.862 --> 17:28.762
I must say good night.

17:30.132 --> 17:32.862
- I've upset you?
- No.

17:33.902 --> 17:36.666
You haven't upset me.
You've just surprised me.

17:38.340 --> 17:40.433
Until tomorrow.

17:47.449 --> 17:48.746
- Ah.
- Shh.

17:50.152 --> 17:52.382
What are you doing here?

17:53.188 --> 17:54.587
I told you I would come.

17:55.657 --> 17:59.024
Well, I'm tired. You should go.

17:59.228 --> 18:02.254
Did my little brother's confession
overwhelm you?

18:02.431 --> 18:05.093
You shouldn't eavesdrop.

18:09.071 --> 18:11.266
Is my love not enough?

18:11.440 --> 18:13.908
I told you, I'm tired.

18:14.109 --> 18:17.442
I wish to be alone tonight.
Please leave.

18:20.749 --> 18:21.773
Good night, Katherine.

18:36.565 --> 18:39.090
<i>Go ahead, Stefan, torture me.</i>

18:39.835 --> 18:43.271
Keep me captive, drain me of my blood
until my body turns to dust.

18:43.438 --> 18:45.065
It'll never change the truth.

18:47.910 --> 18:49.775
I never compelled your love.

18:52.581 --> 18:55.607
It was real, and so was mine.

19:03.225 --> 19:04.283
Dress. Ballerina.

19:04.459 --> 19:06.154
Puppy, puppy. Puppy with a tutu.

19:06.361 --> 19:08.625
- No, no.
- Okay, dog, hound, hound dog.

19:08.831 --> 19:11.925
- "You Ain't Nothing But A Hound Dog."
<i>- Dances With Wolves.</i>

19:12.768 --> 19:15.293
Mason wins again.

19:15.470 --> 19:17.370
How is that a wolf?

19:18.640 --> 19:20.801
Aunt Jenna is getting tipsy.

19:20.976 --> 19:24.878
- Will you stop plying her with alcohol?
- Well, I want her to like me.

19:25.581 --> 19:29.017
- How's Operation Lockwood?
- He's my new BFF.

19:29.184 --> 19:31.778
There you are. Isn't this fun?

19:31.954 --> 19:34.354
Yes. Thank you so much
for inviting me.

19:34.523 --> 19:35.990
Did I have a choice?

19:36.191 --> 19:39.354
- I know what you must think about me...
- No, you don't.

19:39.528 --> 19:42.361
You've never dated you.
I have dated many yous.

19:43.398 --> 19:46.196
Well, I'm a work in progress.

19:49.271 --> 19:50.932
Ooh.

19:52.975 --> 19:54.408
- These are fancy.
- Thanks.

19:55.210 --> 19:56.336
My mother's silver set.

20:07.489 --> 20:10.686
Hearing the truth
after a century and a half of denial...

20:10.859 --> 20:12.190
...must be overwhelming.

20:12.361 --> 20:14.852
It wasn't real.
I remember you compelling me.

20:15.030 --> 20:18.488
Only after I showed you
who I really was.

20:18.667 --> 20:21.363
You were so scared of me,
I had to take away your fear.

20:22.704 --> 20:25.434
Well, whatever feelings
I had back then...

20:27.009 --> 20:28.442
...they've all turned to hate.

20:28.944 --> 20:32.778
Love, hate. Such a fine line.

20:33.515 --> 20:34.880
I can wait.

20:35.751 --> 20:38.618
Anyway, George Lockwood
was causing all sorts of trouble.

20:38.787 --> 20:43.224
He used the vampires
to cover up his own tracks.

20:43.392 --> 20:45.223
Told the founding families about us.

20:45.427 --> 20:48.692
But he was willing to strike a deal.

20:49.665 --> 20:50.927
What kind of a deal?

20:51.366 --> 20:53.698
A deal to rid the town of vampires.

20:53.869 --> 20:56.235
- I just spoke to Giuseppe Salvatore.
- Mm?

20:56.405 --> 20:59.067
- The roundup happens tonight.
- Good.

20:59.241 --> 21:02.369
Insist that they do a body count
before the church is set ablaze.

21:02.544 --> 21:05.638
- I will.
- Twenty-seven vampires.

21:05.814 --> 21:10.274
Once the flames creates chaos,
crawl to the exit under the choir loft.

21:10.452 --> 21:12.886
I'll be there to set you free.

21:13.055 --> 21:15.080
Make sure you're not followed.

21:15.257 --> 21:18.283
I need everyone to believe
that I perished in that fire.

21:18.460 --> 21:22.692
You knew that they were gonna burn
the vampires in the church.

21:24.232 --> 21:25.824
I practically lit the match.

21:26.001 --> 21:28.834
They were your friends.
They were your family.

21:29.004 --> 21:30.403
And you just sold them out.

21:31.940 --> 21:34.067
Without blinking.

21:36.979 --> 21:38.708
Mason.

21:40.015 --> 21:41.846
Why don't you start us off?

21:45.153 --> 21:46.518
Sure.

21:55.831 --> 21:59.858
- What am I? I apologize. I'm an animal.
- Ha, ha.

22:02.804 --> 22:05.432
So, Mason, uh,
you and Jenna never dated?

22:06.942 --> 22:11.345
- She was always lost in Logan Fell land.
- Oh, my first mistake.

22:11.546 --> 22:14.106
Mason was a catch.
He had girls lining up.

22:15.017 --> 22:16.041
Really?

22:16.785 --> 22:20.186
Ha. I always pegged you for a Ione wolf.

22:21.023 --> 22:24.049
Oh, I'm sure
I wasn't half the lady-killer you were.

22:25.994 --> 22:27.552
How about a toast?

22:28.563 --> 22:30.360
To new friends.

22:32.401 --> 22:33.527
- Friends.
- Cheers.

22:35.003 --> 22:36.334
Cheers, guy.

22:37.472 --> 22:40.771
Would I be the worst friend in the world
if I abandoned you and went to Stefan's?

22:41.576 --> 22:42.634
You wanna leave?

22:42.811 --> 22:44.836
It's just that he hasn't
gotten back to me.

22:45.013 --> 22:46.844
I'm starting to get this bad feeling.

22:47.049 --> 22:50.485
- I don't think that's a good idea.
- Damon's got him under control here.

22:50.652 --> 22:53.746
Take it from me, there is nothing worse
than a clingy girlfriend.

22:53.922 --> 22:56.152
I'm not being clingy,
I'm just concerned.

22:56.525 --> 22:59.722
- You understand, right?
- Um, how about I drive you?

23:00.595 --> 23:03.359
Yeah, okay,
that would be great, thanks.

23:03.565 --> 23:05.089
Yeah.

23:27.122 --> 23:30.558
What did George get in return
for giving you your freedom?

23:32.627 --> 23:34.618
Something he wanted desperately.

23:34.830 --> 23:41.394
So you sent 26 of your friends
to their death just to fake your own?

23:43.438 --> 23:46.032
No, you were running from something.
What was it?

23:47.375 --> 23:50.139
Everyone has a past, Stefan.

23:50.345 --> 23:51.972
Mine needed to stay far, far away.

23:52.147 --> 23:57.380
But thanks to you, my plan nearly failed
before it even began.

23:57.586 --> 24:00.248
Once George told me
that the roundup was imminent...

24:01.056 --> 24:03.650
<i>...I made sure</i>
<i>I could see you one last time.</i>

24:05.660 --> 24:06.718
- Vervain.
- What?

24:07.229 --> 24:09.629
<i>But your father</i>
<i>used your love for me against you.</i>

24:09.865 --> 24:11.059
Katherine.

24:11.266 --> 24:12.665
He poisoned your blood.

24:15.070 --> 24:16.162
We don't have long.

24:17.873 --> 24:22.503
<i>Then Damon being Damon,</i>
<i>nearly ruined everything.</i>

24:26.081 --> 24:27.776
No.

24:31.253 --> 24:32.618
We came for you.

24:32.988 --> 24:35.513
- We tried to save you.
- I didn't wanna be saved.

24:35.690 --> 24:37.590
So then Damon and I died for nothing.

24:37.759 --> 24:40.592
- For nothing.
- No, Stefan, you died for love.

24:44.799 --> 24:48.496
Jenna just brought out "Guitar Hero."
Might be time to mutiny.

24:48.904 --> 24:50.997
Well, I just happen
to like "Guitar Hero."

24:51.173 --> 24:54.802
So you, my friend,
are barking up the wrong tree.

24:54.976 --> 24:57.103
Okay, enough with the innuendos.
You win.

24:57.312 --> 24:58.438
- Hilarious.
- Thank you.

24:58.647 --> 25:02.139
Come on, man, you don't think
I know what this barbecue's about?

25:02.317 --> 25:03.716
How do you know about me?

25:04.553 --> 25:07.545
- Your brother was completely clueless.
- Doesn't matter.

25:07.722 --> 25:09.155
I'm not your enemy, Damon.

25:09.491 --> 25:12.426
You tried to kill my brother.

25:12.627 --> 25:14.925
- That was a mistake.
- Really?

25:15.096 --> 25:16.961
There was confusion.
I couldn't chain myself up.

25:17.132 --> 25:20.727
- I have no control once I shift.
- What, no obedience school?

25:21.236 --> 25:22.362
I'm serious.

25:23.171 --> 25:26.004
Let's not spark some age-old feud
that doesn't apply to us.

25:26.741 --> 25:30.370
You expect me to believe that you're
in Mystic Falls planting peace trees?

25:31.179 --> 25:33.044
I lost my brother.

25:33.215 --> 25:35.683
My nephew lost his father.
I'm here for my family.

25:39.054 --> 25:40.885
Let's be above this.

26:04.179 --> 26:06.545
Thanks for this. I appreciate it.

26:06.781 --> 26:09.841
Here we come. To the rescue.

26:10.051 --> 26:13.748
- Why are you being so snippy?
- That's my own drama.

26:14.456 --> 26:17.118
No, I'm sure
that you two will beat the odds.

26:17.292 --> 26:20.557
Not that there's any study
to pull odds from.

26:21.196 --> 26:24.688
What is the ratio of success
for vampire-human couplings?

26:24.866 --> 26:26.026
I'm guessing nil.

26:27.669 --> 26:29.660
Okay, Caroline.

26:29.838 --> 26:31.305
Sorry.

26:34.509 --> 26:37.376
<i>You were right for my body</i>

26:38.980 --> 26:40.914
I love this song.

26:43.018 --> 26:44.315
What's playing?

26:44.486 --> 26:46.647
<i>Playing "We Radiate" by Goldfrapp.</i>

26:46.821 --> 26:47.981
Ta-da.

26:50.158 --> 26:51.785
Oh, crap.

26:53.528 --> 26:55.996
No takers for more drinks at the Grill?

26:56.197 --> 27:00.531
- It's like I'm with a bunch of adults here.
- I prefer the term role model.

27:01.870 --> 27:04.498
Okay, well, thanks for having me.
It was awesome.

27:05.240 --> 27:07.071
Alaric, catch that game next week?

27:07.242 --> 27:09.039
Yeah, look forward to it.

27:09.244 --> 27:12.179
Hey, you know,
I should probably head out too.

27:14.449 --> 27:15.507
Jenna.

27:18.420 --> 27:21.014
You are a wonderful hostess.

27:21.189 --> 27:25.023
And you are a terrible artist.

27:25.226 --> 27:27.888
Is that the only thing
that makes me terrible?

27:28.063 --> 27:30.588
- Still deciding.
- Good enough for me.

27:30.765 --> 27:31.823
Alaric.

27:33.868 --> 27:37.599
Let's not catch that game next week.

27:40.875 --> 27:43.639
Are you sure the tow's coming?
We've been waiting forever.

27:43.845 --> 27:46.814
I know, it's weird.
I mean, they said they'd be here by now.

27:46.981 --> 27:48.608
Yeah.

27:49.551 --> 27:51.382
- I'm just gonna call Jenna.
- No, wait...

27:51.753 --> 27:56.122
Just let me try the tow people again.
And I'll use my aggro voice.

27:56.358 --> 27:59.122
- We can just walk from here.
- I can't just leave my car.

27:59.361 --> 28:01.625
- We'll come back for it.
- Just give me a minute.

28:01.796 --> 28:04.594
What part of "I'm worried about Stefan"
didn't sink in?

28:04.766 --> 28:06.097
What's the rush?

28:06.267 --> 28:10.226
Why are you hurrying to get
to a relationship that'll never work?

28:10.405 --> 28:12.896
Okay, look,
I know that you're upset over Matt...

28:13.074 --> 28:16.066
...but will you stop projecting it
onto me and Stefan, please?

28:16.244 --> 28:18.644
I'm not projecting anything.

28:18.813 --> 28:20.906
You're human, he's a vampire.

28:21.082 --> 28:24.574
You're gonna be 70 and in diapers
and he's still gonna be smoking hot.

28:24.753 --> 28:27.745
And you will never have
his children, Elena...

28:27.922 --> 28:30.254
...and you are too maternal
to not have children.

28:30.759 --> 28:34.024
- Where is this coming from?
- I'm just trying to be your friend.

28:34.195 --> 28:37.756
Okay, well,
do me a favor and stop trying.

28:38.600 --> 28:41.797
- There's the tow. I'm gonna walk.
- No, Elena, don't.

28:42.036 --> 28:43.697
Ah! Caroline, you're hurting me.

28:43.905 --> 28:46.499
Don't leave me alone.

28:47.475 --> 28:49.340
What's wrong with you?

28:50.178 --> 28:51.839
Hey there.

28:52.347 --> 28:56.044
- Someone called about a flat tire?
- She did.

29:07.929 --> 29:09.556
Damon?

29:10.465 --> 29:13.298
- What, more dog jokes?
- Nah, those got old.

29:24.813 --> 29:29.807
You know, I think it was werewolves
who started this whole silver myth.

29:31.152 --> 29:33.882
Probably for moments like this.

29:34.856 --> 29:36.949
Duly noted.

29:39.461 --> 29:41.691
I was really looking forward
to last call.

29:48.102 --> 29:50.263
Now you made an enemy.

29:57.278 --> 30:00.839
You gonna tell me why you came back
or were you just playing another game?

30:01.015 --> 30:03.381
Have you not heard a word
that I've said?

30:03.551 --> 30:06.213
I've answered that question
five times over now.

30:06.387 --> 30:08.048
All right, good. Make it six.

30:10.859 --> 30:12.622
I want what I want, Stefan...

30:13.294 --> 30:15.888
...and I don't care
what I have to do to get it.

30:16.264 --> 30:18.232
My list of victims is a long one.

30:18.433 --> 30:21.368
And I have no problem
adding one more name to that list.

30:21.569 --> 30:22.593
Come on, Katherine.

30:22.770 --> 30:25.603
If you wanted Elena dead,
you would have done it by now.

30:25.773 --> 30:27.001
Still can.

30:28.376 --> 30:32.779
If I have to, I will snap her neck
like a twig, and you know it.

30:46.027 --> 30:48.621
Guess you don't hate me
as much as you thought you did.

30:51.332 --> 30:53.630
I don't want you
seeing Elena anymore.

30:53.801 --> 30:56.065
If you don't remove her
from your life...

30:56.237 --> 30:59.070
...I will kill everyone that she loves
while she watches...

30:59.240 --> 31:01.231
...and then I will kill her
while you watch.

31:03.244 --> 31:06.839
Don't you ever think for one moment
that I will not kill you.

31:13.454 --> 31:18.289
I have been sipping vervain
every single day for the last 145 years.

31:18.860 --> 31:22.091
You caught me by surprise once.
I wasn't gonna let it happen again.

31:22.664 --> 31:24.598
It doesn't hurt me, Stefan.

31:25.133 --> 31:28.159
- What? Why?
- I told you.

31:28.336 --> 31:29.667
I've missed you, Stefan.

31:30.505 --> 31:32.234
I just wanted
to spend some time with you.

31:33.608 --> 31:35.098
Hello?

31:38.179 --> 31:40.170
Stefan?

31:52.594 --> 31:54.391
Stefan?

31:59.334 --> 32:01.666
You must be Elena.

32:13.948 --> 32:16.382
How is this possible?

32:18.620 --> 32:20.747
How do we look exactly alike?

32:36.938 --> 32:39.498
You're asking the wrong questions.

32:41.209 --> 32:42.733
Elena.

32:49.417 --> 32:50.907
You okay?

32:51.919 --> 32:53.352
Not really.

32:55.323 --> 32:57.154
Are you okay?

32:57.358 --> 32:58.518
Not really.

33:16.177 --> 33:17.542
Katherine.

33:17.745 --> 33:21.044
Care to share how you couldn't
follow through with one simple task?

33:21.616 --> 33:23.481
I tried, okay?

33:23.651 --> 33:27.382
But I couldn't exactly kidnap
my best friend.

33:27.622 --> 33:30.523
Occupy her. That's all I asked.

33:30.958 --> 33:33.188
I told her
that her relationship was doomed...

33:33.361 --> 33:38.060
...and, you know, all that mortality stuff,
and I think l...

33:38.299 --> 33:41.029
I really think that I got to her.

33:42.070 --> 33:43.662
I hope so.

33:43.871 --> 33:47.034
Because let's not forget.
I already killed you once.

33:47.208 --> 33:49.972
I can easily do it again.

33:56.918 --> 34:00.217
- How's that barbecue?
- Not great.

34:00.421 --> 34:03.015
- You still pissed?
- You still keeping secrets?

34:03.224 --> 34:05.522
- Yep.
- Then I'm still pissed.

34:07.595 --> 34:11.031
Hey, you know, I was thinking
about that stone you're looking for.

34:11.199 --> 34:13.690
I might know a couple places
it could be.

34:14.502 --> 34:16.663
Do you think this is a joke?

34:17.304 --> 34:19.670
- Lf you know, tell me.
- Tell me how the curse is triggered.

34:19.841 --> 34:22.708
You won't think about anything else.
I don't want that for you.

34:22.877 --> 34:26.335
- I think I can handle knowing.
- You think you can handle it, tough guy?

34:26.514 --> 34:28.744
- You have no idea.
- You want your rock or not?

34:28.949 --> 34:30.746
- Tell me.
- What triggers the curse?

34:30.952 --> 34:33.079
You have to kill somebody.
Human blood.

34:33.254 --> 34:36.917
You take another person's life away
from them, the curse is yours forever.

34:41.195 --> 34:42.253
Can you handle that?

34:47.568 --> 34:49.331
Hi. Come on.

34:51.773 --> 34:54.799
<i>There is where the chapter ends</i>

34:55.909 --> 34:57.810
- Elena?
- Hey.

34:57.979 --> 34:59.571
Hey.

35:01.616 --> 35:05.643
Oh, my God,
I am so sorry about earlier today.

35:05.853 --> 35:07.616
I don't know what came over me.

35:07.855 --> 35:10.153
It's okay, Caroline.

35:10.625 --> 35:13.219
Everything that you were saying
was right.

35:13.394 --> 35:17.728
It's just hard for me to hear,
you know?

35:19.934 --> 35:22.095
So you're not mad at me?

35:24.071 --> 35:26.232
You were just being a good friend...

35:26.407 --> 35:28.272
...in your own way.
- Ha, ha.

35:28.743 --> 35:31.610
My own headcase...

35:32.113 --> 35:34.013
...horrible way.

35:35.183 --> 35:36.980
Elena?

35:37.185 --> 35:39.153
I really am sorry.

35:39.320 --> 35:43.950
<i>It's hard to walk away</i>

35:44.158 --> 35:49.221
<i>From the best of days</i>

35:49.430 --> 35:54.561
<i>But if it has to end</i>
<i>I'm glad you have been my friend</i>

35:55.937 --> 35:56.961
I'm starving.

35:57.138 --> 35:59.197
Well, spending a day
with your jealous ex...

35:59.407 --> 36:01.102
...will do that to you.

36:02.276 --> 36:06.144
Listen, I know you're upset, all right?
But we have to take her seriously.

36:06.314 --> 36:09.477
Today was all about the lengths
that she will go to.

36:10.151 --> 36:12.517
If she was going to hurt me,
she would have.

36:12.687 --> 36:16.282
- I was standing right in front of her.
- Elena, you caught her off-guard.

36:16.457 --> 36:18.186
It doesn't mean that you're safe.

36:18.626 --> 36:21.493
- I'm not afraid of her.
- Well, you should be.

36:21.929 --> 36:24.898
Look, if Katherine had her way,
we'd be breaking up right now.

36:25.066 --> 36:28.968
And if today taught me anything, it's
that Katherine's used to getting her way.

36:29.136 --> 36:32.628
You're not actually saying
that we should do what she says.

36:32.807 --> 36:36.004
Listen, she's sadistic, okay?

36:36.177 --> 36:38.702
She threatened you.
She threatened everyone.

36:38.880 --> 36:41.906
Yeah, no, I get it, okay?
She's dangerous.

36:42.083 --> 36:45.348
But every day that we're together,
it's dangerous.

36:45.553 --> 36:48.386
Why are you giving her so much power
over our relationship?

36:48.589 --> 36:50.648
Because it's the reality
of our situation.

36:50.825 --> 36:53.191
Well, reality sucks.

36:56.597 --> 36:58.497
This is what she wants.

36:58.666 --> 37:03.035
She wants us to fight.
She wants to get between us.

37:06.007 --> 37:08.373
She already has, Elena.

37:49.650 --> 37:51.345
Bad day?

37:52.053 --> 37:53.350
Bad century.

37:55.356 --> 37:58.291
- Heard you were on the loose.
- What's the matter?

37:58.459 --> 38:01.792
- Jealous I spent the day with Stefan?
- I don't do jealous.

38:01.963 --> 38:04.898
Not with you. Not anymore.

38:06.734 --> 38:08.167
Then why so pouty?

38:08.402 --> 38:10.666
Tried to kill a werewolf and failed.

38:10.871 --> 38:13.738
Now I feel like I'm not living up
to my best self.

38:13.941 --> 38:15.841
Well, werewolves aren't easy prey.

38:16.010 --> 38:19.468
- What do you know about werewolves?
- Why don't you ask your brother?

38:20.181 --> 38:23.275
Don't try to be the hero, Damon.
You'll end up dead.

38:23.451 --> 38:25.646
Been there, done that.

38:25.820 --> 38:28.414
At least this time, it'll be worth it.

38:56.717 --> 38:57.911
You okay?

39:02.023 --> 39:03.285
Come on.

39:04.525 --> 39:05.856
I hated that fight.

39:06.527 --> 39:08.552
I know. Me too.

39:08.729 --> 39:10.356
Felt too real. Ha, ha.

39:16.837 --> 39:18.327
Did you see Caroline?

39:18.539 --> 39:20.632
- Yeah.
- We were right.

39:20.841 --> 39:23.469
Katherine got to her.
She was hanging on to every word.

39:23.644 --> 39:26.204
It won't be long
before Katherine gets a play-by-play.

39:26.380 --> 39:29.747
I wish I was wrong,
but I know Caroline too well.

39:29.950 --> 39:32.077
It was so obvious
that something was up today.

39:32.253 --> 39:34.084
You're not wrong. It's pure Katherine.

39:34.255 --> 39:37.247
She's always finding somebody
to do her dirty work.

39:37.892 --> 39:40.019
I think Damon
was listening to us fight too.

39:40.761 --> 39:42.820
Are you gonna tell him
that it wasn't real?

39:43.230 --> 39:46.324
The only way Katherine is gonna believe
is if everybody believes it.

39:46.500 --> 39:49.594
It's the best way to make her think
she's getting what she wants.

39:49.770 --> 39:53.399
All this, just to get you back.

39:57.244 --> 39:59.735
That's not why she's here, okay?

40:00.548 --> 40:02.607
No matter what she says.

40:02.850 --> 40:04.181
I know her.

40:04.752 --> 40:09.746
<i>Katherine doesn't care</i>
<i>about anybody but herself.</i>

40:09.990 --> 40:11.981
<i>She never has.</i>

40:12.493 --> 40:15.121
<i>She's incapable of love.</i>

40:18.265 --> 40:20.529
<i>She's here for another reason.</i>

40:24.305 --> 40:26.500
- George.
- Your carriage is waiting.

40:26.707 --> 40:28.197
Well done, George. Thank you.

40:28.375 --> 40:31.503
Ah. Now, on to your part of the deal.

40:33.514 --> 40:36.779
If anyone learns of my escape,
I will find you and I will kill you.

40:39.620 --> 40:41.781
Don't think that I won't.

40:45.759 --> 40:49.058
We shall take each other's secrets
to the grave.

40:51.065 --> 40:53.090
Now, you must hurry.

41:14.188 --> 41:15.587
I love you, Stefan.

41:19.293 --> 41:21.591
We will be together again.

41:22.062 --> 41:24.087
I promise.
