52:21.666 --> 52:24.708
[Autumn] What is this, Royal?

52:30.208 --> 52:33.250
I don't...
I don't know what it is.

52:35.333 --> 52:37.208
Well, you must know something.

52:37.291 --> 52:39.666
Why else would you throw
a body in there?

52:39.750 --> 52:41.541
[flashlight clicks]

52:49.750 --> 52:52.500
You know about
the Greek god Chronos?

52:53.958 --> 52:55.375
What?

52:55.458 --> 52:58.375
He's trickled down, you know,

52:58.458 --> 53:01.375
into every civilization.

53:01.458 --> 53:03.541
He's evolved here and there.

53:03.625 --> 53:08.125
He always carried a...
like, a sickle.

53:10.833 --> 53:13.750
- Listen...
- He used that sickle

53:13.833 --> 53:15.708
to cut a hole.

53:15.791 --> 53:19.375
You know, make a tear in the
cosmos between heaven and earth

53:19.458 --> 53:22.708
to separate this world
from the next.

53:22.791 --> 53:27.791
To separate the-the known
from the unknown.

53:27.875 --> 53:31.750
You see,
that's how we got time.

53:31.833 --> 53:34.416
Because Chronos is chronology.

53:40.708 --> 53:42.166
Who else knows about this?

53:42.250 --> 53:44.250
[breathing heavily]

53:48.916 --> 53:51.208
No one.

53:53.166 --> 53:54.875
Really?

53:56.541 --> 53:58.375
- Yeah.
- Why?

54:04.250 --> 54:05.875
I won't tell anyone.

54:07.458 --> 54:12.458
Hey, I'm not gonna tell anyone.

54:12.541 --> 54:15.500
This'll be our little secret.

54:17.666 --> 54:18.791
Deal?

54:23.416 --> 54:27.083
