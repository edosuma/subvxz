00:10.080 --> 00:11.250
Hey, I brought you lunch.

00:11.250 --> 00:13.120
Chili, your favorite.

00:13.120 --> 00:15.170
Thanks.
You don't have to whisper.

00:15.170 --> 00:16.750
We're not on air yet.

00:16.750 --> 00:18.540
Oh, sorry,
I'm just a civilian.

00:18.540 --> 00:20.000
I don't know broadcasting.

00:20.000 --> 00:22.920
The girls' basketball team
roster is being announced,

00:22.920 --> 00:24.080
and I want to hear
my name live.

00:24.080 --> 00:27.880
In three, two, one...

00:29.500 --> 00:31.500
Yeah, that's not
how it works.

00:31.500 --> 00:32.580
Right. Civilian.

00:32.580 --> 00:34.120
However you do it
in the biz.

00:38.420 --> 00:39.790
Hello, Marshport High.

00:39.790 --> 00:41.830
It's Harley, with today's
announcements.

00:41.830 --> 00:44.120
First up,
I'm happy to report

00:44.120 --> 00:46.790
our favorite Driver's Ed.
teacher, Mr. Miller,

00:46.790 --> 00:47.750
is walking again.

00:47.750 --> 00:50.170
He's receiving
any and all visitors,

00:50.170 --> 00:52.120
except for Ava Gibbs.

00:54.080 --> 00:55.830
In sports news,

00:55.830 --> 00:58.830
the members of this season's
girls' basketball team

00:58.830 --> 00:59.830
are...

01:01.120 --> 01:03.960
What? Georgie's not
on the list.

01:03.960 --> 01:05.330
The real news is,

01:05.330 --> 01:08.830
"Georgie Diaz's entire life is
about to crumble into despair."

01:08.830 --> 01:10.330
I can't announce that.

01:10.330 --> 01:12.790
Maybe there'll be
a fire drill.

01:13.880 --> 01:15.880
Never when you need one.

01:15.880 --> 01:17.620
All right, here goes.

01:20.920 --> 01:22.790
And the basketball team
members are...

01:30.920 --> 01:32.500
Oh, technical difficulties.

01:32.500 --> 01:33.670
We'll pick this up
tomorrow.

01:34.830 --> 01:36.120
Hand spasm.

01:36.120 --> 01:38.380
Giant bummer.
We can't read the list now.

01:38.380 --> 01:39.710
Here, I'll wipe it off.

01:46.120 --> 01:47.960
Another hand spasm.

01:47.960 --> 01:49.460
I'd better get to the nurse.

01:49.460 --> 01:52.330
Is she going to give you
something for faking

01:52.330 --> 01:53.880
Out with it.

01:53.880 --> 01:55.000
Fine.

01:55.000 --> 01:57.120
You're going to find out anyway,
may as well be from me.

01:58.290 --> 01:59.920
-You got cut.

02:06.330 --> 02:07.920
I don't believe it.

02:07.920 --> 02:09.920
After all these years
of eating,

02:09.920 --> 02:12.750
drinking and sleeping
basketball,

Hi, Georgie.

03:20.380 --> 03:21.880
Get away!

03:21.880 --> 03:24.880
Well, glad I decided
not to wear it.

03:24.880 --> 03:26.710
Why do you have
Terry the Terrier?

03:26.710 --> 03:27.880
No, the question is,

03:27.880 --> 03:30.120
why do you have
Terry the Terrier?

03:30.120 --> 03:32.580
You can't cut Georgie
from the team, Coach.

03:32.580 --> 03:35.380
Our family has spent more on
basketball camp than groceries.

03:35.380 --> 03:36.830
Basketball is her life.

03:36.830 --> 03:38.290
I get it.

03:38.290 --> 03:40.210
Why do you think I had you
do the announcement?

03:40.210 --> 03:42.790
But Georgie's got more spirit
than the entire bench.

03:42.790 --> 03:44.880
How many players
have gone to urgent care

03:44.880 --> 03:46.830
for cheering so hard
they injured themselves?

03:46.830 --> 03:49.790
Georgie does get folks fired up.

03:49.790 --> 03:51.790
What if I let her
be the mascot?

03:51.790 --> 03:53.420
Kevin Casey's
been lobbying for it,

03:53.420 --> 03:54.790
but Georgie's a better fit,

03:54.790 --> 03:57.420
in spirit and in head size.

03:58.830 --> 04:00.330
You're going to be
the mascot!

04:00.330 --> 04:02.080
Thanks, but no.

04:03.670 --> 04:05.710
What do you mean, no?

04:05.710 --> 04:08.290
This is the perfect replacement
for basketball.

04:08.290 --> 04:09.880
Nice try, but what I liked
about basketball

04:09.880 --> 04:11.460
was being a part of a team.

04:11.460 --> 04:13.710
As mascot,
it'd be just me.

04:13.710 --> 04:15.920
Not to be rude,
but you'd be doing exactly

04:15.920 --> 04:17.790
what you did on the team:

04:17.790 --> 04:19.040
cheering them on
from the side.

04:20.540 --> 04:22.960
Come on, you're always
rallying the family.

04:22.960 --> 04:24.920
Now you can rally
the whole school.

04:24.920 --> 04:27.120
I did date the Eagle
from St. Joseph's Academy,

04:27.120 --> 04:29.000
so I'm familiar
with the mascot code.

04:29.000 --> 04:31.880
I'd tell you about it,
but I'm not allowed to say.

04:31.880 --> 04:34.170
Literally. You're not allowed
to talk in costume.

04:34.170 --> 04:37.120
So, what do you think?

04:37.120 --> 04:39.210
Time to take your spirit
off the bench

04:39.210 --> 04:41.000
and onto center stage?

04:42.120 --> 04:44.380
All right, I'll do it.

04:44.380 --> 04:46.750
Now let's go upstairs
and practice raising the roof.

04:46.750 --> 04:50.420
Or should I say,
raising the woof.

04:50.420 --> 04:53.000
There's a reason
why the mascots don't talk.

04:53.000 --> 04:54.330
Yeah.

05:03.080 --> 05:06.920
Okay, I love that you're being
quiet, but you almost killed me.

05:06.920 --> 05:08.580
What's the point
of living

05:08.580 --> 05:11.920
if Dad took Ethan and Daphne
to the monster truck rally?

05:13.670 --> 05:15.210
Yeah, he should've
taken us.

05:15.210 --> 05:16.880
What have those two
ever done

05:16.880 --> 05:18.500
to prove that they love
smashing things?

05:18.500 --> 05:21.040
We work hard at it
every day.

05:21.040 --> 05:22.880
Guys, I'm sorry,

05:22.880 --> 05:25.210
but you drew names
out of a hat.

05:25.210 --> 05:28.250
And all we drew
was sadness.

05:28.250 --> 05:30.120
What about having fun
here with Mom?

05:32.040 --> 05:33.750
Thanks, Mom.
That was a nice break.

05:33.750 --> 05:36.380
But we should probably
get back to being bummed.

05:38.170 --> 05:39.620
Plus, don't take this
the wrong way,

05:39.620 --> 05:41.750
but Dad's kind of
the fun parent.

05:41.750 --> 05:44.460
What was the right way
to take that?

05:44.460 --> 05:46.250
I can be fun.

05:46.250 --> 05:48.710
Fun people
don't say that.

05:48.710 --> 05:50.330
It's okay, Mom.
You don't have to be fun.

05:50.330 --> 05:52.040
There's plenty of other things
you're good at.

05:52.040 --> 05:54.920
Making lunches.
Worrying.

05:54.920 --> 05:56.210
Laying down the law.

05:56.210 --> 05:57.960
You say "don't"
more than anybody.

05:57.960 --> 05:59.920
You're the Queen of Don't.

05:59.920 --> 06:02.620
Queen of Don't?

06:03.790 --> 06:05.790
I wasn't always the un-fun mom.

06:05.790 --> 06:07.460
In fact, when I was your age,

06:07.460 --> 06:10.290
they used to call me
Cyclone Suzy.

06:10.290 --> 06:12.880
That's cute. We'll believe it
when we see it.

06:12.880 --> 06:15.250
Well, believe it,
because Cyclone Suzy

06:15.250 --> 06:17.250
is touching down
in Marshport,

06:17.250 --> 06:19.380
and she is ready to do
all the fun things

06:19.380 --> 06:21.790
that you normally do
behind her back.

06:22.830 --> 06:24.670
Do you trust her?

06:24.670 --> 06:28.250
Not sure yet,
but I am intrigued.

06:36.790 --> 06:37.670
I'm kind of nervous.

06:37.670 --> 06:39.380
What if I don't pep up
this pep rally?

06:39.380 --> 06:40.620
I've got spirit.
Yes, I do.

06:40.620 --> 06:42.420
I've got spirit,
but how about them?

06:42.420 --> 06:44.250
No one even knows
you're in there.

06:44.250 --> 06:47.420
You have got nothing to lose.
Just have fun. Hmm?

06:53.000 --> 06:54.880
Look out, everyone.

06:54.880 --> 06:58.580
Terry is off leash and kicking
this party into high gear!

07:03.250 --> 07:04.620
Come on, people!

07:04.620 --> 07:06.330
Whoo! Terry!

07:06.330 --> 07:07.420
Yeah!

07:07.420 --> 07:09.580
Let's do the wave!

07:21.830 --> 07:23.250
Okay, party people.

07:23.250 --> 07:25.330

08:31.420 --> 08:33.250
You slayed out there.

08:35.420 --> 08:37.500
It's just me, Georgie.
You can talk.

08:38.580 --> 08:41.420
Hi, I'm Jo,
dance team captain.

08:41.420 --> 08:44.920
I just want to say we were
blown away by your moves.

08:44.920 --> 08:46.170
Who is in there?

08:47.380 --> 08:49.880
Well, we'd like to recruit
whoever's in there

08:49.880 --> 08:51.540
to be on dance team.

08:52.880 --> 08:55.170
Terry, did you hear that,

08:55.170 --> 08:57.500
or are those ears
just decoration?

08:57.500 --> 08:59.460
They want you
on their team.

09:05.210 --> 09:06.420
That's my sister Georgie
in there.

09:06.420 --> 09:08.000
She's such a kidder.

09:08.000 --> 09:10.500
So she does want to be
on dance team?

09:12.460 --> 09:14.580
I finally found something
Georgie's great at.

09:14.580 --> 09:16.380
I can't let her waste it.

09:16.380 --> 09:19.170
That would be like Shakespeare
never picking up a pen,

09:19.170 --> 09:22.420
or Beast never picking up
a whoopee cushion.

09:22.420 --> 09:24.670
Absolutely.
She would love to.

09:24.670 --> 09:26.920
She'll see you
at practice.

09:26.920 --> 09:28.500
And she'll be bringing that.

09:30.420 --> 09:32.250
Now, before we show you
the things

09:32.250 --> 09:34.710
we may or may not do
behind your back,

09:34.710 --> 09:37.420
we need your assurance
that we will not be punished,

09:37.420 --> 09:40.330
put in lockdown
or finger-wagged at.

09:40.330 --> 09:41.880
Do we have an accord?

09:41.880 --> 09:45.040
The Queen of Don't
has left the premises.

09:45.040 --> 09:48.620
It's Cyclone Suzy
from here on out.

10:00.460 --> 10:02.120
Let it begin.

10:02.120 --> 10:04.250
First up: Gut Shot.

10:04.250 --> 10:07.380
So... so we want those
to hit me in the stomach?

10:07.380 --> 10:09.460
Yeah, that's the whole point
of Gut Shot.

10:10.460 --> 10:12.120
Oh!

10:12.120 --> 10:13.380
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

10:13.380 --> 10:14.710
They're just stone pucks.

10:14.710 --> 10:15.960
-Whoo!
-No big deal.

10:15.960 --> 10:17.670
Oh! Oh!

10:17.670 --> 10:19.460
Yeah!

10:19.460 --> 10:21.880
Next, Hide-and-Go-Pie.

10:25.580 --> 10:27.540
-Found you!

10:27.540 --> 10:29.540
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

10:30.540 --> 10:33.420
You ruined my shirt!

10:34.330 --> 10:36.710
Which doesn't
bother me at all.

10:36.710 --> 10:40.000
Yeah, I love pie. Yum.

10:40.000 --> 10:41.620
Mmm.

10:41.620 --> 10:44.000
Yeah, that's shaving cream.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.080
Then: Berry Battles.

10:46.080 --> 10:48.250
Mom?

10:48.250 --> 10:50.120
Who's "Mom"?

10:50.120 --> 10:52.460
This is Cyclone Suzy's town.

11:01.500 --> 11:03.420
Aah!

11:03.420 --> 11:05.250
-Yes!
-Whoo-hoo!

11:05.250 --> 11:06.500
Yeah.

11:06.500 --> 11:08.000
I ruined another shirt.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.750
So fun.

11:12.000 --> 11:13.290
Great day, boys.

11:13.290 --> 11:15.500
So, who wants some
lemonade?

11:15.500 --> 11:17.920
But we haven't played
Duck, Duck, Marker.

11:17.920 --> 11:19.380
There's more?

11:21.920 --> 11:23.330
Does this look like
I'm raising the roof

11:23.330 --> 11:24.580
or pumping up the jam?

11:24.580 --> 11:27.420
Put down that roof.
I've got great news.

11:27.420 --> 11:30.500
I said "yes" to the dance
team for you.

11:30.500 --> 11:32.920
What? You took advantage
of a non-speaking dog.

11:32.920 --> 11:34.120
You knew I said no.

11:34.120 --> 11:35.880
You didn't actually
say anything.

11:35.880 --> 11:38.040
Why wouldn't you want
to do dance?

11:38.040 --> 11:39.920
How'd you even get
so good?

11:39.920 --> 11:42.790
Listening to dance music is how
I psych myself up for games.

11:53.000 --> 11:54.460
I'm serious
about my psych-up.

11:54.460 --> 11:56.580
Most game days,
it's the only exercise I get.

11:56.580 --> 12:00.080
However it happened, you're too
talented not to do this.

12:00.080 --> 12:03.080
You're way better at dance than
you've ever been at anything.

12:03.080 --> 12:06.540
Basketball, softball,
volleyball, pinball--

12:06.540 --> 12:08.170
Okay, stop.
I get where you're going.

12:08.170 --> 12:10.580
I'd rather be mascot.
It's good enough.

12:10.580 --> 12:12.120
Good enough is not great.

12:12.120 --> 12:13.540
You deserve great.

12:13.540 --> 12:15.040
Your talent
shouldn't be hidden

12:15.040 --> 12:16.920
under a giant ridiculous
dog head.

12:16.920 --> 12:19.500
Harley, he's right here.

12:19.500 --> 12:22.710
What you loved about basketball
was being part of a team.

12:22.710 --> 12:25.460
Well, here's your chance.
You're being recruited.

12:27.330 --> 12:28.750
Being mascot is safe.

12:28.750 --> 12:30.920
When you're part of a team,
you can get cut.

12:30.920 --> 12:32.460
But when you were on
all those teams,

12:32.460 --> 12:34.540
if I may,

12:34.540 --> 12:38.500
you were way, way, way less good
than you are at dancing.

12:38.500 --> 12:40.000
You stunk.

12:44.080 --> 12:46.380
Okay, I'm in.

12:47.330 --> 12:48.710
And next time you ask
"if I may,"

12:48.710 --> 12:50.040
wait for an answer.

12:53.170 --> 12:54.580
Oh, yeah!

12:54.580 --> 12:56.170
Are you sure that was
the first time

12:56.170 --> 12:57.580
you played
Duck, Duck, Marker?

12:57.580 --> 12:59.580
Because you are
really good at it.

13:00.960 --> 13:02.540
You'd think being good
at Duck, Duck, Marker

13:02.540 --> 13:06.040
would mean that you don't
have marker all over your face.

13:06.040 --> 13:07.330
How would that be fun?

13:07.330 --> 13:09.580
I got to admit,
at first,

13:09.580 --> 13:11.790
we were skeptical
about Cyclone Suzy.

13:11.790 --> 13:14.460
But she is the real deal.

13:16.250 --> 13:17.580
Time to learn
from the master.

13:17.580 --> 13:19.420
Hit us with
your best games.

13:19.420 --> 13:20.830
More games?

13:20.830 --> 13:24.540
But we've been playing all day.
I thought we were done.

13:24.540 --> 13:26.290
Are you tired?

13:26.290 --> 13:29.460
Oh, maybe you don't have
any games.

13:29.460 --> 13:32.500
What? No, I have plenty
of games.

13:32.500 --> 13:36.380
It's just that they might
be too crazy.

13:36.380 --> 13:37.920
The laws are
different today.

13:37.920 --> 13:40.620
Didn't you say you were
more fun than Dad?

13:40.620 --> 13:42.620
Gotcha!

13:42.620 --> 13:46.420
I just wanted to see
how tired you were.

13:46.420 --> 13:49.380
Because I have crazy games.

13:49.380 --> 13:54.120
Look out, because Cyclone Suzy's
going to blow your windows out.

13:54.120 --> 13:55.580
Let's do this.

13:59.330 --> 14:00.880
Mom, have some respect.

14:00.880 --> 14:03.500
It's for handshakes only.

14:03.500 --> 14:04.750
Oh.

14:08.170 --> 14:09.330
Hey, Georgie.

14:09.330 --> 14:11.580
We're so excited
to have you join the team.

14:11.580 --> 14:14.460
Oh, me too. I watched hours
of dance team videos online

14:14.460 --> 14:16.460
and memorized
a bunch of the moves.

14:16.460 --> 14:19.380
Head snap up, hands in the air,
enthusiastic elbows,

14:19.380 --> 14:20.960
twist booty pop,
shimmy shimmy bobblehead,

14:20.960 --> 14:22.540
block the sun,
block the sun,

14:22.540 --> 14:24.580
outlaw frog, hop-hop.

14:24.580 --> 14:26.420
What you looking at?

14:26.420 --> 14:28.880
Oh, sorry, that was the move,
not a complaint.

14:28.880 --> 14:32.250
Wow, you named things I didn't
know we were even doing.

14:32.250 --> 14:33.330
I'm glad you're a quick study.

14:33.330 --> 14:35.420
It'll help us prepare
for the pep rally later.

14:35.420 --> 14:38.380
All right, get in formation.
We'll take it from the top.

14:47.580 --> 14:49.580
Five, six, seven, eight.

14:59.210 --> 15:00.960
Did someone hit "pause"
on Georgie?

15:11.040 --> 15:15.080
Okay, what was up with you
at dance practice?

15:15.080 --> 15:16.880
I've never seen you
panic like that.

15:16.880 --> 15:18.670
And that includes the time
you couldn't turn off

15:18.670 --> 15:20.380
the frozen yogurt dispenser.

15:20.380 --> 15:23.580
I saw all those eyes,
and I just froze up.

15:23.580 --> 15:25.120
When I was dancing
in the costume,

15:25.120 --> 15:26.670
everyone was looking
at Terry the Terrier.

15:26.670 --> 15:29.040
But when it was just me,

15:29.040 --> 15:31.210
everyone was looking at Georgie,
the nervous human being.

15:31.210 --> 15:34.290
It's too much.
The dance team isn't for me.

15:34.290 --> 15:37.500
You can't give up.
You're too good.

15:37.500 --> 15:40.380
Being the star of a team
is your dream.

15:40.380 --> 15:42.500
I appreciate you looking out
for my dreams,

15:42.500 --> 15:43.960
but I can't
live up to them.

15:43.960 --> 15:46.120
I'll go back to being
the mascot.

15:46.120 --> 15:47.330
But you can't.

15:47.330 --> 15:50.790
It's fine. I've already
let dance team go.

15:50.790 --> 15:54.290
No, I mean, you really can't.

15:54.290 --> 15:55.670
What?

15:55.670 --> 15:58.170
He's all yours, Kev.
Wear it with pride.

15:58.170 --> 16:00.290
And, if possible,
an air freshener.

16:00.290 --> 16:01.710
I don't know what to say!

16:01.710 --> 16:03.290
Good, because once
you're in the costume,

16:03.290 --> 16:04.710
you're not allowed to talk.

16:09.120 --> 16:12.000
How could you? I just ordered
a personalized dog collar

16:12.000 --> 16:13.290
with our home address.

16:13.290 --> 16:14.790
You can't cancel
a custom order.

16:14.790 --> 16:16.960
I thought you had moved on
to dance team.

16:16.960 --> 16:18.670
I was trying
to pass on the joy.

16:18.670 --> 16:20.380
You didn't pass it on,
you gave it away.

16:20.380 --> 16:21.960
This is typical Harley.

16:21.960 --> 16:23.620
I was fine, but then you push,
push, pushed me

16:23.620 --> 16:24.960
out of my comfort zone.

16:24.960 --> 16:26.210
Now I have nothing.

16:26.210 --> 16:27.580
You don't have nothing.

16:27.580 --> 16:29.250
You have a big
dog collar coming.

16:29.250 --> 16:31.210
You'll always know
our address.

16:36.420 --> 16:37.670
Mom, can I ask you
something?

16:40.460 --> 16:43.790
Ooh, congrats on winning
Duck, Duck, Marker.

16:43.790 --> 16:46.620
Yeah, apparently
I'm a natural.

16:46.620 --> 16:48.500
What's up?

16:48.500 --> 16:50.960
So, I pushed Georgie
into doing dance team

16:50.960 --> 16:53.580
because she's
an amazing dancer.

16:53.580 --> 16:55.710
But it turns out
she's afraid to bust a move

16:55.710 --> 16:57.250
with everybody watching.

16:57.250 --> 16:59.580
I want to help her,
but I don't know how.

16:59.580 --> 17:02.500
I get it.
When I dance at weddings, I'm...

17:05.920 --> 17:07.880
But when I'm home, I'm...

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
I'm sorry, which one
was supposed to be good?

17:15.000 --> 17:16.790
The second one.

17:16.790 --> 17:17.960
See?

17:19.830 --> 17:20.880
Totally.

17:22.210 --> 17:24.460
When I'm around family,
I'm comfortable.

17:24.460 --> 17:26.710
Okay, so I just need to make
Georgie feel like

17:26.710 --> 17:27.960
she's around family.

17:29.460 --> 17:31.290
I think I have an idea
that might work.

17:31.290 --> 17:33.460
Thanks, Mom.

17:33.460 --> 17:34.960
Oh, where do I put these?

17:34.960 --> 17:37.710
And, more importantly,
what am I holding them for?

17:37.710 --> 17:39.330
I wish I knew.

17:39.330 --> 17:40.670
I'm collecting them
hoping to come up

17:40.670 --> 17:42.750
with a game
for your brothers.

17:42.750 --> 17:44.920
Does Sled Ball
sound fun?

17:44.920 --> 17:47.960
The look on your face
makes me want to say yes.

17:47.960 --> 17:50.880
You're right,
it's a terrible idea.

17:50.880 --> 17:53.380
I guess I'm just going to have
to come clean to the boys

17:53.380 --> 17:56.000
that I'm not as fun
as I pretended to be.

17:56.000 --> 17:57.670
Fun is kind of Dad's thing.

18:01.080 --> 18:02.830
Georgie, wait.

18:02.830 --> 18:04.750
Don't give back
your uniform yet.

18:04.750 --> 18:06.500
It's okay,
I should thank you.

18:06.500 --> 18:07.880
You helped push me
to do something

18:07.880 --> 18:09.790
I've never done before:
quit.

18:09.790 --> 18:11.250
Hold that thought.

18:11.250 --> 18:13.460
I've invented something to help
you get over stage fright.

18:14.460 --> 18:16.790
Spectator Specs.

18:18.830 --> 18:20.880
Thanks to the magic
of digital overlap,

18:20.880 --> 18:23.290
you won't have to dance in front
of a bunch of strangers.

18:23.290 --> 18:26.290
Wow, everyone looks like
a brilliant inventor

18:26.290 --> 18:28.420
who gets too involved
in her sister's life.

18:30.330 --> 18:32.080
Thank you. I love them.

18:32.080 --> 18:33.710
It'll be like
dancing around our room

18:33.710 --> 18:35.250
with a few hundred Harleys
watching.

18:35.250 --> 18:38.250
Now, go change
and give this school a little

18:38.250 --> 18:39.750
"What you looking at?"

18:39.750 --> 18:41.960
Hey, you're almost
as good as Mom.

18:47.750 --> 18:49.960
-Cyclone Suzy!
-Cyclone Suzy!

19:05.670 --> 19:06.750
So, that's Sled Ball?

19:09.830 --> 19:13.790
Wow, that banister shattered
pretty easy, didn't it?

19:13.790 --> 19:16.290
That's because last year
we broke it

19:16.290 --> 19:19.500
and we glued it back together
with melted fruit snacks.

19:19.500 --> 19:21.170
Don't tell Mom.

19:21.170 --> 19:24.250
Yeah, about her.

19:24.250 --> 19:26.460
She owes you an apology.

19:26.460 --> 19:30.710
She was trying to impress you
so you'd think she was fun.

19:30.710 --> 19:32.290
But the truth is,

19:32.290 --> 19:34.290
there's never been
a Cyclone Suzy.

19:34.290 --> 19:35.710
I made her up.

19:35.710 --> 19:37.500
-Good.
-Phew!

19:37.500 --> 19:40.750
Okay, this may be post-Sled Ball
wooziness,

19:40.750 --> 19:43.290
but you guys
sound relieved.

19:43.290 --> 19:45.290
I can't believe
we're going to say this,

19:45.290 --> 19:47.830
but living in a house
with no rules has been weird.

19:47.830 --> 19:50.750
The whole thrill of doing stuff
you're not supposed to

19:50.750 --> 19:52.120
is maybe getting caught.

19:53.540 --> 19:57.380
It's cops and robbers,
not robbers and robbers.

19:57.380 --> 19:59.710
And while you make
an awesome robber,

19:59.710 --> 20:01.790
we need you
to be our cop.

20:01.790 --> 20:03.790
You want me to be you cop?

20:03.790 --> 20:06.420
Well, I can do that
all day long.

20:06.420 --> 20:08.420
Pick up those balls.
Put away that sled.

20:08.420 --> 20:11.330
Melt some fruit snacks
and fix that banister.

20:13.170 --> 20:15.250
No, seriously, go.

20:19.710 --> 20:21.420
Okay, everyone,

20:21.420 --> 20:23.670
the performance you've all
been waiting for:

20:23.670 --> 20:26.790
The Marshport High
Dance Team!

20:40.830 --> 20:42.750
Whoo!

21:04.620 --> 21:07.580
What are you doing?
Georgie, get up.

21:09.000 --> 21:10.960
You're ruining the dance.

21:10.960 --> 21:12.750
Seriously, they're all
staring at you.

21:12.750 --> 21:14.960
Get out there!
Pull focus! Save her!

21:14.960 --> 21:16.540
I can't rush my debut.

21:16.540 --> 21:18.000
That's not even
my entrance song.

21:18.000 --> 21:20.540
Well, then it's mine.

21:30.460 --> 21:32.620
-Whoa!
-No, no, no, no!

21:32.620 --> 21:34.750
Get out of the way!

21:34.750 --> 21:36.040
Whoa!

21:37.040 --> 21:38.750
Where am I? Whoa!

21:42.710 --> 21:46.830
Go, Terrier football!

after all.

22:36.750 --> 22:39.790
Turns out no amount
of fake Harleys in the audience

22:39.790 --> 22:41.710
is as powerful
as the real Harley

22:41.710 --> 22:43.040
needing her sister's help.

22:48.000 --> 22:49.580
Purple ice?

22:49.580 --> 22:51.040
Was this in your grape juice?

22:51.040 --> 22:52.920
Don't bring me used ice.

22:54.040 --> 22:55.750
The Queen of Don'ts
is back!

22:55.750 --> 22:57.830
Yeah, Mom.
You're no fun.

22:57.830 --> 23:00.420
Aw, thanks.

23:00.420 --> 23:03.620
Sometimes, when you
step outside your comfort zone,

23:03.620 --> 23:05.040
you crash.

23:09.880 --> 23:12.420
And sometimes, you soar.
