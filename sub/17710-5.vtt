00:34.960 --> 00:37.725
<i>One quarter of all the land on Earth</i>

00:37.800 --> 00:41.361
<i>is covered by a single,
remarkable type of plant.</i>

00:47.760 --> 00:52.129
<i>Almost indestructible,
it can grow two feet in a day...</i>

00:58.560 --> 01:01.882
<i>And be tall enough to hide a giant.</i>

01:06.200 --> 01:08.521
<i>That plant is grass,</i>

01:08.600 --> 01:11.888
<i>and the world it creates
is truly unique.</i>

01:25.440 --> 01:29.161
<i>The grass in northern India
is the tallest on the planet,</i>

01:29.320 --> 01:33.370
<i>home to some of the most
impressive creatures to tread the Earth.</i>

01:48.360 --> 01:50.488
<i>These are the good times,</i>

01:50.560 --> 01:54.201
<i>but in just a few months,
all this fresh growth will be gone,</i>

01:54.760 --> 01:57.843
<i>and the animals
will be forced to move on.</i>

02:00.560 --> 02:05.168
<i>That is the way things are
on grasslands across the planet.</i>

02:08.840 --> 02:13.050
<i>A cycle of abundance,
destruction and rebirth</i>

02:13.400 --> 02:15.721
<i>that affects every creature
that lives here.</i>

02:30.640 --> 02:35.248
<i>The largest grassland on Earth,
the vast Eurasian Steppe,</i>

02:35.680 --> 02:39.082
<i>stretches one third of the way
around our planet.</i>

02:43.400 --> 02:48.566
<i>Spring rain has brought fresh grass,
and with it, new life.</i>

02:52.760 --> 02:57.402
<i>A relic from the Ice Age,
a baby Saiga antelope,</i>

02:57.680 --> 02:59.489
<i>just three hours old.</i>

03:02.680 --> 03:04.921
<i>His only company, his twin.</i>

03:06.240 --> 03:10.848
<i>Until they can stand, their mother
has left them hidden in the grass.</i>

03:18.560 --> 03:22.485
<i>They should be safe,
as long as they remain quiet.</i>

03:27.480 --> 03:30.370
<i>For these calves,
the clock is already ticking.</i>

03:31.920 --> 03:36.562
<i>Their herd will soon be moving on,
seeking the freshest new grass.</i>

03:53.840 --> 03:58.402
<i>Their lanky legs are a sure sign that
they're built for a life on the move.</i>

04:22.760 --> 04:25.684
<i>Saiga always give birth to twins,</i>

04:25.760 --> 04:29.287
<i>so their numbers grow rapidly
just when grass is plentiful.</i>

04:32.680 --> 04:36.048
<i>Their bizarrely shaped nose
can detect fresh growth</i>

04:36.360 --> 04:38.328
<i>from hundreds of miles away.</i>

04:50.080 --> 04:53.323
<i>The young twins will now
begin the nomadic life</i>

04:53.520 --> 04:57.605
<i>they share with most animals
on the world's open plains.</i>

05:18.760 --> 05:24.369
<i>Grasslands occur where rain is
too sporadic for forests to exist.</i>

05:34.520 --> 05:37.888
<i>The rain that a grassland
needs to survive for a year</i>

05:38.160 --> 05:40.242
<i>might arrive all at once.</i>

06:00.840 --> 06:05.846
<i>Storms like these can release
12 inches of rain in 24 hours.</i>

06:16.600 --> 06:19.251
<i>Not much fun if you're out in it.</i>

06:30.960 --> 06:34.248
<i>Eventually the earth
can't soak up any more,</i>

06:37.120 --> 06:40.567
<i>and the grassland undergoes
a radical change.</i>

06:47.400 --> 06:51.883
<i>Many plants would drown here,
but grasses thrive.</i>

06:55.000 --> 06:56.126
<i>They grow so fast,</i>

06:56.200 --> 06:59.568
<i>their leaves quickly rise above
the water and into the sunlight.</i>

07:04.200 --> 07:05.964
<i>Here in southern Africa,</i>

07:06.040 --> 07:10.602
<i>water transforms one of the most
remarkable grasslands on Earth,</i>

07:13.160 --> 07:14.207
<i>the Okavango.</i>

07:17.920 --> 07:22.244
<i>Every year, 5,000 square miles
of grassland are flooded.</i>

07:30.200 --> 07:34.205
<i>For one pride of lions,
this poses a major problem.</i>

07:36.520 --> 07:38.921
<i>There may be plenty of prey around,</i>

07:39.000 --> 07:41.685
<i>but lions struggle
to run it down in water.</i>

07:48.760 --> 07:53.607
<i>The pride has three-month-old cubs.
They've never seen water before.</i>

07:57.520 --> 07:59.648
<i>If their mothers
don't make a kill soon,</i>

08:00.240 --> 08:02.766
<i>the cubs might not survive the week.</i>

08:12.160 --> 08:17.769
<i>But fuelled by the flood, the eruption
of grass attracts new possible prey.</i>

08:20.960 --> 08:24.009
<i>Buffalo arrive in herds 2,000 strong.</i>

08:31.480 --> 08:34.404
<i>Powerful, aggressive and united,</i>

08:34.799 --> 08:37.690
<i>they're the most dangerous animal
a lion can face.</i>

09:15.040 --> 09:17.247
<i>The biggest bulls don't run.</i>

09:19.560 --> 09:22.848
<i>They're simply too huge
to be scared of lions.</i>

09:25.320 --> 09:30.201
<i>At 900 kilos, he weighs more
than all five lionesses combined.</i>

09:34.640 --> 09:37.086
<i>The pride do have numbers on their side,</i>

09:38.720 --> 09:41.564
<i>but one sweep of his horns
could be deadly.</i>

09:55.360 --> 09:59.649
<i>One distracts the bull up front,
while her sisters attack from behind.</i>

10:10.520 --> 10:12.807
<i>The cats must somehow
topple the buffalo,</i>

10:13.000 --> 10:16.163
<i>but with swamp under foot,
they can't get any traction.</i>

10:59.240 --> 11:00.844
<i>The bull is weakening,</i>

11:01.720 --> 11:03.882
<i>but the lions are tiring, too.</i>

11:08.880 --> 11:12.521
<i>It's now a battle of will
as much as strength.</i>

11:15.680 --> 11:19.162
<i>To live, the bull must somehow
shake off the lioness.</i>

11:57.000 --> 11:58.570
<i>The bull is wounded,</i>

11:58.640 --> 12:02.361
<i>but thanks to his two-inch-thick hide,
he will recover.</i>

12:08.200 --> 12:11.522
<i>For the pride, these are hungry times.</i>

12:19.640 --> 12:24.407
<i>But, ultimately, once the water recedes,
there will be new life,</i>

12:25.400 --> 12:27.562
<i>and new food to benefit all.</i>

12:36.720 --> 12:40.645
<i>In the right conditions,
grasses have the extraordinary ability</i>

12:40.720 --> 12:45.487
<i>to grow from first shoots to flower
in a matter of only days.</i>

12:52.080 --> 12:56.290
<i>Grasses become the miniature equivalents
of fruiting trees.</i>

13:03.600 --> 13:06.171
<i>And for creatures living
within the grass,</i>

13:06.240 --> 13:10.529
<i>this is a landscape as vast
and towering as any rainforest.</i>

13:15.600 --> 13:18.490
<i>And excellent place
to build a tiny tree house</i>

13:21.000 --> 13:22.206
<i>for a harvest mouse.</i>

13:34.280 --> 13:38.410
<i>During summer,
European meadowlands are full of food,</i>

13:41.760 --> 13:43.967
<i>but only for those that can reach it.</i>

14:02.400 --> 14:05.370
<i>Climbing grass is harder
than climbing trees,</i>

14:05.520 --> 14:08.763
<i>not least because their stems
just won't stay still.</i>

14:16.520 --> 14:19.888
<i>Her prehensile tail
acts like a fifth limb,</i>

14:19.960 --> 14:23.965
<i>so she's as agile as a monkey
clambering around in a tree.</i>

14:31.680 --> 14:32.966
<i>And just as well,</i>

14:33.320 --> 14:37.689
<i>for the best food in this tiny forest
is at the very top of its canopy.</i>

14:48.440 --> 14:51.364
<i>Feeding up here, she's exposed.</i>

14:58.720 --> 14:59.881
<i>A barn owl.</i>

15:30.800 --> 15:32.643
<i>Not her finest move...</i>

15:36.440 --> 15:37.646
<i>But it did the trick.</i>

15:39.800 --> 15:43.202
<i>Harvest mice seldom go
all the way down to the ground.</i>

15:46.480 --> 15:49.768
<i>It's a tangled and
dangerous world down here.</i>

16:03.000 --> 16:07.210
<i>But she can read the pattern
of the stems overhead like a map,</i>

16:08.320 --> 16:10.209
<i>and so find her way home.</i>

16:18.240 --> 16:20.686
<i>And not a minute too soon.</i>

16:25.240 --> 16:27.288
<i>There are mouths to feed.</i>

16:41.040 --> 16:43.168
<i>Her babies must fatten up quickly.</i>

16:45.440 --> 16:49.923
<i>They need to harvest the summer grasses
while they're still rich with food.</i>

16:58.360 --> 17:03.127
<i>On the African savannah, too,
seasonal grasses are filled with life,</i>

17:03.640 --> 17:05.005
<i>but it won't last long.</i>

17:08.560 --> 17:11.848
<i>Carmine bee-eaters
are superb aerial hunters,</i>

17:13.560 --> 17:17.007
<i>experts at catching insects in midair.</i>

17:24.359 --> 17:27.807
<i>But they have no way of
flushing their prey out of the grass.</i>

17:37.920 --> 17:41.129
<i>Once alarmed, most insects stay put.</i>

17:44.480 --> 17:48.121
<i>The bee-eaters need someone
to stir things up a bit.</i>

17:54.040 --> 17:55.166
<i>A kori bustard.</i>

18:00.200 --> 18:02.521
<i>It's the world's heaviest flying bird,</i>

18:02.600 --> 18:05.251
<i>so it should be bulky enough
to kick up some insects.</i>

18:13.240 --> 18:14.241
<i>Bingo!</i>

18:17.200 --> 18:22.240
<i>Until someone else comes along
and cramps your style.</i>

18:28.160 --> 18:32.210
<i>Never mind, perhaps there are
bigger opportunities ahead.</i>

18:35.360 --> 18:37.010
<i>What about an ostrich?</i>

18:39.680 --> 18:41.011
<i>The heaviest bird of all.</i>

18:46.920 --> 18:50.561
<i>This time there's more than enough
transport to go around.</i>

19:00.600 --> 19:04.491
<i>Soon, almost every ostrich
has its own passenger.</i>

19:12.240 --> 19:15.926
<i>But free riders are only
tolerated for so long.</i>

19:22.480 --> 19:24.608
<i>What the bee-eaters really need</i>

19:24.680 --> 19:27.923
<i>is a creature so big
it won't even notice them.</i>

19:38.120 --> 19:43.206
<i>Nothing cuts a swathe through grass
like an African bull elephant.</i>

19:59.520 --> 20:03.525
<i>The trick is to fly as close to
the front of the giant as possible.</i>

20:04.160 --> 20:07.323
<i>They only have a split second
to grab the prize.</i>

20:17.000 --> 20:21.164
<i>As more insects are stirred up,
the competition intensifies.</i>

20:43.120 --> 20:47.569
<i>With summer drawing to a close,
the race to stock up is on.</i>

20:52.800 --> 20:57.840
<i>Soon, the grass will wither,
and this opportunity will have gone.</i>

21:07.360 --> 21:09.931
<i>As the dry season takes hold,</i>

21:10.000 --> 21:12.651
<i>food becomes increasingly thin
on the ground.</i>

21:15.320 --> 21:20.201
<i>Now, only the most specialised predators
on the plains can make a living.</i>

21:25.720 --> 21:30.362
<i>She may be spotted like a cheetah,
but this cat is no sprinter.</i>

21:43.080 --> 21:48.405
<i>Instead, she has extra-long legs
which give her a high vantage point.</i>

21:59.480 --> 22:04.611
<i>But a serval cat's main weapon
are enormous radar ears.</i>

22:08.800 --> 22:11.929
<i>They help her pinpoint prey
hiding in the grass.</i>

22:20.760 --> 22:23.730
<i>But the prey she seeks are canny.</i>

22:27.520 --> 22:28.931
<i>Southern vlei rats.</i>

22:32.200 --> 22:35.568
<i>They know that any sustained movement
can give them away.</i>

22:41.200 --> 22:43.680
<i>So they move in short bursts.</i>

22:51.600 --> 22:54.843
<i>But even the slightest rustle
will give her a clue.</i>

23:17.120 --> 23:18.121
<i>Warm.</i>

23:30.480 --> 23:31.606
<i>Warmer.</i>

23:45.880 --> 23:46.961
<i>Missed.</i>

25:06.440 --> 25:09.523
<i>In better times,
she could catch 10 a day,</i>

25:10.880 --> 25:15.363
<i>but now, with so few rodents around,
she will have to go hungry.</i>

25:17.720 --> 25:22.169
<i>As drought intensifies,
life gets tougher for all.</i>

25:28.920 --> 25:32.561
<i>Predators with permanent territories
must tough it out,</i>

25:33.320 --> 25:37.291
<i>while most of their prey
disappear over the horizon.</i>

25:41.520 --> 25:47.084
<i>To avoid starvation, many grassland
animals follow a nomadic way of life.</i>

25:49.440 --> 25:53.490
<i>Over 2,000,000 wildebeests wander
the East African savannahs</i>

25:53.560 --> 25:55.244
<i>chasing the rains.</i>

26:08.880 --> 26:10.962
<i>And they are not alone.</i>

26:13.320 --> 26:14.810
<i>Arriving on the wing,</i>

26:14.880 --> 26:18.566
<i>Jackson's Widowbirds
also seek fresh grass.</i>

26:20.600 --> 26:23.968
<i>Although, it's not just
food that they're after.</i>

26:28.520 --> 26:30.602
<i>This male wants a mate.</i>

26:33.760 --> 26:36.764
<i>He's grown elaborate breeding plumage
for this moment,</i>

26:38.800 --> 26:41.690
<i>but he needs a stage
on which to show it off.</i>

26:46.040 --> 26:50.364
<i>By carefully selecting grass blades,
each trimmed to the correct length,</i>

26:51.080 --> 26:53.242
<i>he's creating something very special.</i>

27:08.200 --> 27:10.771
<i>He needs an even surface,</i>

27:12.800 --> 27:14.131
<i>and a centre-piece.</i>

27:16.920 --> 27:18.285
<i>The stage is set.</i>

27:19.640 --> 27:24.123
<i>His bachelor pad is sufficiently
neat and tidy to attract a female.</i>

27:25.960 --> 27:27.007
<i>The problem is,</i>

27:27.480 --> 27:28.641
<i>can she see it?</i>

27:32.680 --> 27:33.806
<i>He has competition.</i>

27:44.160 --> 27:48.324
<i>It might take more than a little
gardening to impress the ladies.</i>

27:50.760 --> 27:52.603
<i>Jumping is the right idea,</i>

27:53.960 --> 27:56.327
<i>but he's misjudged
the height of the grass.</i>

28:06.240 --> 28:08.163
<i>His rival makes it look easy.</i>

28:31.400 --> 28:33.482
<i>Time to raise his game.</i>

29:09.080 --> 29:13.802
<i>It's not only who jumps the highest,
but who can keep doing so the longest.</i>

29:22.880 --> 29:27.647
<i>Unable to go the distance,
his rivals drop out one by one.</i>

29:32.280 --> 29:35.409
<i>Stamina has won him admirers,</i>

29:36.840 --> 29:40.003
<i>now he can show off
his courtship arena...</i>

29:49.440 --> 29:53.081
<i>And engage in a little
romantic hide-and-seek.</i>

30:05.000 --> 30:07.606
<i>Finally, he's done enough.</i>

30:19.320 --> 30:23.484
<i>The East African savannahs
support millions of grazers.</i>

30:24.800 --> 30:28.282
<i>Each year they devour
millions of tons of grass,</i>

30:30.440 --> 30:32.568
<i>and yet there's one creature here</i>

30:32.640 --> 30:37.521
<i>whose impact is far greater
than all these animals combined.</i>

30:41.560 --> 30:44.530
<i>They're found wherever
grass grows on the planet,</i>

30:45.280 --> 30:48.409
<i>yet their labours go
almost entirely unnoticed.</i>

30:53.320 --> 30:58.804
<i>One of the most remarkable is found here
on the grasslands of South America.</i>

31:01.760 --> 31:07.483
<i>These blades are so tough that virtually
no large grass eaters can stomach them.</i>

31:08.720 --> 31:12.361
<i>Yet they're harvested
on an industrial scale...</i>

31:16.360 --> 31:19.011
<i>...by tiny grass cutter ants.</i>

31:25.920 --> 31:28.685
<i>But they themselves
can't digest one bit of it.</i>

31:31.920 --> 31:33.251
<i>So, why bother?</i>

31:37.600 --> 31:40.080
<i>The answer is underground,</i>

31:42.120 --> 31:44.168
<i>and it's very ingenious.</i>

31:48.840 --> 31:54.131
<i>Each blade is cut to length
and placed into a garden of fungus.</i>

31:59.120 --> 32:05.526
<i>The rotting grass feeds the fungus,
and in turn the fungus feeds the ants.</i>

32:09.120 --> 32:13.444
<i>But feeding 5,000,000 workers
requires intensive agriculture.</i>

32:16.040 --> 32:19.283
<i>Luckily, they are an industrious lot.</i>

32:23.760 --> 32:28.687
<i>This colony alone will collect
over half a ton of grass every year.</i>

32:32.880 --> 32:36.248
<i>With billions of ant colonies
across the world's grasslands</i>

32:36.400 --> 32:41.804
<i>all doing exactly the same thing,
that's a mind-boggling amount of grass.</i>

33:10.040 --> 33:13.965
<i>It's estimated that over one third
of the grass that grows on Earth</i>

33:14.440 --> 33:17.091
<i>will be harvested by an insect.</i>

33:23.160 --> 33:29.008
<i>In northern Australia, termites
memorialise their industry in sculpture.</i>

33:36.960 --> 33:40.009
<i>These astonishing mounds
are 10 feet tall.</i>

33:40.760 --> 33:43.684
<i>They're always built
on a north-south axis,</i>

33:43.760 --> 33:47.048
<i>which is why their builders
are called compass termites.</i>

34:00.600 --> 34:02.329
<i>These castles of clay</i>

34:02.400 --> 34:05.131
<i>protect their builders
from extremes of heat</i>

34:05.200 --> 34:09.045
<i>and seasonal floods
experienced on many grasslands.</i>

34:20.560 --> 34:24.849
<i>Termites manage to do
what most grass eaters can't,</i>

34:25.920 --> 34:29.242
<i>break down dead grass
and extract the nutrients.</i>

34:30.600 --> 34:34.491
<i>But they themselves can be food
for those that can reach them.</i>

34:40.159 --> 34:41.924
<i>A two-foot-long tongue</i>

34:43.239 --> 34:45.368
<i>covered in microscopic hooks,</i>

34:48.760 --> 34:53.129
<i>followed by claws longer
than those of a velociraptor.</i>

34:59.320 --> 35:02.767
<i>A giant anteater
on the plains of South America.</i>

35:07.720 --> 35:10.803
<i>It can devour 20,000 insects a day.</i>

35:16.080 --> 35:21.325
<i>Powerful forelegs enable it to rip apart
a termite hill with ease.</i>

35:31.320 --> 35:36.451
<i>And as the sun bakes the grass,
the termites face new danger.</i>

35:58.520 --> 36:02.605
<i>In minutes, fire turns grassland to ash.</i>

36:16.480 --> 36:22.010
<i>But the grasses are not dead.
Their underground stems are unharmed.</i>

36:25.280 --> 36:27.647
<i>Weeks, months may pass,</i>

36:28.080 --> 36:32.802
<i>but eventually the rains will return
and the grass will sprout again.</i>

36:39.920 --> 36:45.131
<i>Some grasslands must endure
not only fire, but ice.</i>

36:50.440 --> 36:55.128
<i>As winter approaches, the prairies
of North America begin to freeze.</i>

37:11.120 --> 37:13.646
<i>In summer, bison roamed freely,</i>

37:13.720 --> 37:17.202
<i>almost continuously cropping
the abundant green grass.</i>

37:19.120 --> 37:24.331
<i>Now, that grass is not only withered
and frozen, it's about to be buried.</i>

37:45.880 --> 37:50.568
<i>Sixty million tons of snow
now blanket this herd's territory.</i>

37:54.600 --> 37:57.843
<i>Pushing through deep snow
is exhausting work,</i>

37:57.920 --> 38:00.526
<i>and the bison are now slowly starving.</i>

38:07.520 --> 38:10.808
<i>Just keeping warm
saps huge amounts of energy.</i>

38:17.320 --> 38:21.450
<i>Their thick coats can insulate them
down to minus 20 Fahrenheit.</i>

38:22.360 --> 38:24.283
<i>It's now minus 40.</i>

38:27.280 --> 38:32.923
<i>The only thing that will keep them alive
is buried beneath three feet of snow.</i>

38:37.560 --> 38:41.042
<i>And that's a problem shared
with a surprising neighbour.</i>

38:58.920 --> 39:02.561
<i>The food the fox seeks
is also deep beneath the snow.</i>

39:14.920 --> 39:19.562
<i>The survival of both creatures depends
on getting through to the ground.</i>

39:25.040 --> 39:28.647
<i>For the bison, it will be
a matter of brute strength.</i>

39:33.400 --> 39:38.088
<i>Massive neck muscles enable them
to shovel five tonnes of snow a day.</i>

39:44.560 --> 39:47.484
<i>Their light-weight neighbour
needs more precision.</i>

40:15.080 --> 40:17.048
<i>The bison have reached their goal,</i>

40:17.840 --> 40:20.207
<i>a mouthful of withered grass.</i>

40:23.960 --> 40:28.568
<i>And where the bison have dug,
the fox now spots an opportunity.</i>

40:37.520 --> 40:39.602
<i>Every footstep counts,</i>

40:42.560 --> 40:44.210
<i>but he mustn't break through...</i>

40:45.200 --> 40:46.201
<i>Yet.</i>

40:49.480 --> 40:52.882
<i>He listens carefully
to pinpoint his target.</i>

40:58.600 --> 40:59.601
<i>It's moving.</i>

41:21.280 --> 41:22.281
<i>A vole.</i>

41:24.840 --> 41:30.210
<i>Small, but 100 times more nutritious
than a mouthful of dried grass.</i>

41:36.920 --> 41:42.882
<i>To get through the winter on these
prairies, sometimes brain beats brawn.</i>

41:49.600 --> 41:55.084
<i>Ultimately, life on all grasslands
depends on the turn of the seasons.</i>

42:20.720 --> 42:24.202
<i>Five hundred miles further north
than any tree can survive,</i>

42:24.280 --> 42:26.886
<i>grass returns to life.</i>

42:37.680 --> 42:40.889
<i>Caribou females have
journeyed to the far north</i>

42:41.640 --> 42:42.766
<i>to calve.</i>

42:46.600 --> 42:51.401
<i>Over 70,000 caribou babies
will be born in the next few days.</i>

42:56.240 --> 43:01.087
<i>As the calves appear, so too do the
leaves of the newly sprouting grass.</i>

43:04.600 --> 43:06.602
<i>And the calves must strengthen quickly.</i>

43:07.000 --> 43:10.243
<i>Within days they will have to
keep up with their parents</i>

43:10.360 --> 43:12.328
<i>on a never-ending march.</i>

43:17.320 --> 43:22.360
<i>At one day old, they're already faster
than an Olympic sprinter.</i>

43:23.480 --> 43:27.485
<i>They're testing the legs that will
carry them thousands of miles,</i>

43:29.000 --> 43:31.287
<i>better to learn their limitations now.</i>

43:51.200 --> 43:55.330
<i>It may look playful, but there's
no harder life on the grasslands</i>

43:55.400 --> 43:58.051
<i>than that facing these infants.</i>

44:01.440 --> 44:03.681
<i>The caribou mothers now join together,</i>

44:03.760 --> 44:06.843
<i>each with an infant
exactly the same age.</i>

44:15.400 --> 44:20.531
<i>They're setting off on the greatest
overland trek made by any animal.</i>

44:43.680 --> 44:48.846
<i>But wherever grass eaters travel,
predators lie in wait.</i>

44:55.640 --> 44:59.531
<i>Here they are, Arctic wolves.</i>

45:06.640 --> 45:08.244
<i>They must seize their chance</i>

45:08.320 --> 45:10.800
<i>while the caribou
pass through their territory.</i>

45:46.920 --> 45:51.528
<i>The wolf runs at the herd, trying to
flush out the weak or the slow.</i>

46:00.920 --> 46:02.604
<i>A calf is separated.</i>

46:10.960 --> 46:15.682
<i>At full tilt, 40 miles an hour,
the wolf is just faster.</i>

46:24.000 --> 46:26.480
<i>But the calf has stamina.</i>

46:56.080 --> 47:01.484
<i>Only a few weeks old, and this
calf's will to survive is remarkable.</i>

47:06.800 --> 47:08.643
<i>And it needs to be,</i>

47:09.080 --> 47:12.050
<i>for these young caribou
have now started a journey</i>

47:12.320 --> 47:14.163
<i>that will last a lifetime.</i>

47:17.480 --> 47:22.281
<i>Forever chasing the seasonal growth
of the grass on which they depend.</i>

47:31.360 --> 47:34.569
<i>Like all grassland creatures,
they are at the mercy</i>

47:34.640 --> 47:39.089
<i>of these unpredictable
but ultimately bountiful lands.</i>

47:45.200 --> 47:49.171
<i>Grass can survive some of
the harshest conditions on Earth,</i>

47:49.240 --> 47:53.529
<i>flood, fire and frost,
and still flourish.</i>

48:03.760 --> 48:07.162
<i>So it is that grasslands
provide a stage</i>

48:07.440 --> 48:11.126
<i>for the greatest gatherings of wildlife
on planet Earth.</i>

48:25.760 --> 48:29.481
<i>For the grasslands team,
no location would prove as challenging</i>

48:29.600 --> 48:33.241
<i>as that dominated by elephant grass
in northeast India.</i>

48:34.640 --> 48:39.680
<i>The aim, to capture intimate images of
some the world's most elusive creatures</i>

48:40.120 --> 48:42.327
<i>using the latest technology.</i>

48:49.480 --> 48:51.403
<i>But they will need to be careful.</i>

48:56.880 --> 49:00.089
<i>More people are killed by wildlife
here in Kaziranga</i>

49:02.520 --> 49:05.490
<i>than in any other
national park on the planet.</i>

49:07.560 --> 49:09.369
Every time we go into these tunnels,

49:10.040 --> 49:11.724
we have to take an armed guard,

49:12.360 --> 49:14.886
'cause there are so many animals
in here that are dangerous.

49:14.960 --> 49:17.122
Tigers are probably
the least of our worries,

49:17.440 --> 49:19.169
but rhinos and buffalo,

49:19.560 --> 49:21.961
elephants, sloth bear,
all of them can injure you.

49:22.160 --> 49:24.242
And we gotta keep up
with our armed guard.

49:30.240 --> 49:32.561
<i>The team have bumped
into their first obstacle.</i>

49:34.280 --> 49:35.770
There's a rhino right there.

49:38.960 --> 49:43.249
Let's go back because it's too risky
going through this heavy grass.

49:45.640 --> 49:46.971
Let's get in the open.

49:48.360 --> 49:50.203
There's another rhino.

49:52.000 --> 49:54.207
- Now we have two rhinos.
- Let's get in here.

49:56.560 --> 49:57.561
Okay.

49:58.280 --> 50:01.523
<i>The guard throws
a ball of mud to one side of the rhinos,</i>

50:01.760 --> 50:04.331
<i>moving the animals on
without harming them.</i>

50:12.400 --> 50:14.402
- We're okay. It's gone.
- Okay.

50:14.760 --> 50:16.091
What about the other one?

50:16.320 --> 50:17.481
Let's go, quick.

50:22.000 --> 50:24.571
<i>With the rhinos
now a safe distance away,</i>

50:24.640 --> 50:28.565
<i>the crew focus on the best spots
to position their camera traps.</i>

50:29.080 --> 50:30.809
I love that tunnel, the effect.

50:34.920 --> 50:38.322
<i>Over 100 scaffold poles
provide the anchor points</i>

50:38.400 --> 50:40.289
<i>for these secret cameras.</i>

50:41.280 --> 50:43.647
<i>When an animal triggers
an infrared beam,</i>

50:43.720 --> 50:46.963
<i>the cameras will switch on automatically
and start recording.</i>

50:48.240 --> 50:52.802
<i>If it works, the remote-control cameras
should capture close-up footage</i>

50:52.960 --> 50:56.282
<i>without disturbing the animals
or putting the crew at risk.</i>

50:57.680 --> 51:00.763
Basically, that's about as much
like grass as we can make it look.

51:02.680 --> 51:06.082
<i>As night falls,
the crew head back to base for safety.</i>

51:08.200 --> 51:11.921
<i>It's time for the new technology
to prove its worth.</i>

51:17.840 --> 51:22.448
<i>At dawn, the crew have
a whodunnit mystery on their hands.</i>

51:22.640 --> 51:24.290
Oh, wow.

51:25.080 --> 51:26.286
That's carnage!

51:27.680 --> 51:29.444
This looks like elephant, we think?

51:30.840 --> 51:32.683
This is scaffold pole

51:34.080 --> 51:36.560
they have bent.
Look at that.

51:39.920 --> 51:42.605
It's a sad day.
You win some, you lose some.

51:43.160 --> 51:45.606
And this time,
the animals have outsmarted us.

51:46.640 --> 51:48.768
In fact, check this out.

51:49.280 --> 51:50.327
Whoo-hoo.

51:50.400 --> 51:55.042
So this is our little army of guards,
protecting our trigger box.

51:55.640 --> 51:58.450
Do they bite? These ones, they bite?

51:59.000 --> 52:00.047
Sting?

52:00.120 --> 52:01.963
Whoa! Argh! Ow!

52:02.640 --> 52:04.768
The little (BLEEP).

52:08.360 --> 52:10.522
<i>While Chadden
irons out the bugs,</i>

52:11.480 --> 52:14.324
<i>Sandesh has met some grumpy locals.</i>

52:18.080 --> 52:21.641
<i>Wild Asian water buffalo
have extraordinary senses.</i>

52:24.160 --> 52:26.686
<i>Mothers will charge
if they feel threatened.</i>

52:29.560 --> 52:33.042
<i>The guard carries a gun,
in case a warning shot is needed,</i>

52:33.200 --> 52:34.611
<i>and with good reason.</i>

52:37.360 --> 52:42.685
<i>More people are killed by buffalo
than by any other animal in Kaziranga.</i>

52:49.760 --> 52:51.489
That'll wake you up in the morning.

52:52.200 --> 52:55.682
<i>Many of the park staff
have cautionary tales about buffalo.</i>

53:00.080 --> 53:03.641
The buffalo caught him here,
through his throat

53:04.320 --> 53:07.210
and the horn came out through his mouth

53:07.720 --> 53:10.246
and flung him before running away.

53:10.320 --> 53:12.800
It's a miracle that he's still alive.

53:15.000 --> 53:17.526
<i>If the wildlife
is unfriendly to humans,</i>

53:18.760 --> 53:21.730
<i>it's proving downright hostile
to camera traps.</i>

53:22.120 --> 53:25.442
Completely ripped out
the scaffold poles,

53:26.240 --> 53:29.244
they've torn the triggers.

53:30.440 --> 53:32.602
<i>While Chadden
is convinced it's elephants,</i>

53:32.680 --> 53:34.523
<i>the rest of the crew are not so sure.</i>

53:34.600 --> 53:36.011
This is huge!

53:36.640 --> 53:38.369
It's almost like a human footprint.

53:38.800 --> 53:41.804
You can see the front paw, the rear paw.

53:41.960 --> 53:46.329
We are now two weeks in
and it's very frustrating.

53:46.560 --> 53:49.166
I've never actually been anywhere
where the animals

53:49.880 --> 53:52.565
go after your equipment and destroy it,
more than here.

53:53.680 --> 53:56.843
<i>It's time for the team
to do some detective work.</i>

53:58.800 --> 54:01.644
Here is our little security camera.

54:01.720 --> 54:04.929
If any animals are coming through
and vandalising our main cameras,

54:05.640 --> 54:09.087
we hope that they're being caught
on these little things.

54:12.120 --> 54:14.566
<i>As the crew
up their spying efforts,</i>

54:14.640 --> 54:17.041
<i>the guards take them
to a promising lead.</i>

54:18.080 --> 54:21.289
<i>Nothing attracts tigers
like a rhino carcass.</i>

54:21.960 --> 54:24.884
It's very fresh.
It's like from the morning.

54:25.240 --> 54:27.129
And it looks like there's a tiger cub,

54:28.120 --> 54:32.967
so it should be a tigress with cubs,
coming to feed on this rhino carcass.

54:33.240 --> 54:34.321
It's pretty cool.

54:35.760 --> 54:39.401
<i>Chadden decides to give
the camera traps one last chance.</i>

54:40.080 --> 54:44.847
<i>If there are tigers around, they might
scare away the mystery vandals.</i>

54:46.360 --> 54:47.646
<i>Elsewhere in the park,</i>

54:47.720 --> 54:51.361
<i>the security cameras are
turning up some unexpected results.</i>

54:51.840 --> 54:55.401
At nighttime, survived another... Ooh!

54:56.080 --> 54:57.206
It's a bear.

54:58.200 --> 54:59.929
Wow, that's a very rare sighting.

55:00.080 --> 55:01.764
I've never seen a bear
in Kaziranga.

55:01.840 --> 55:03.410
In all my years, never.

55:04.800 --> 55:08.646
- Oh, his fingernails...
- Look at his claws, right on the lens.

55:09.640 --> 55:11.802
So I thought
this was elephant damage.

55:12.800 --> 55:15.883
I never thought we'd see
a sloth bear doing that.

55:16.720 --> 55:17.767
That's amazing.

55:21.840 --> 55:26.084
<i>A return to
the rhino carcass and the plot thickens.</i>

55:27.440 --> 55:28.771
Our transmitter's gone.

55:29.640 --> 55:31.005
That's what tigers
think of camera traps.

55:31.080 --> 55:33.003
Do you think
there's a bit over there?

55:33.160 --> 55:34.161
Pieces.

55:34.600 --> 55:38.127
<i>The security cameras
have caught a new culprit.</i>

55:38.240 --> 55:40.129
Oh, my goodness,
there they are.

55:40.200 --> 55:41.201
Ooh!

55:41.320 --> 55:43.607
There it's a tigress, see that.
It's a tigress.

55:43.680 --> 55:45.887
It snarled at the camera trap,
look at that.

55:45.960 --> 55:47.485
Sure don't like camera traps.

55:48.240 --> 55:49.241
Okay.

55:50.640 --> 55:52.768
<i>With the technology struggling,</i>

55:52.840 --> 55:56.447
<i>Sandesh decides
to put himself on the frontline.</i>

55:56.520 --> 55:58.284
- It's on.
- And now we're ready.

55:59.160 --> 56:00.491
Time to get the tiger.

56:02.120 --> 56:05.647
<i>He'll have no protection
apart from a thin wall of grass,</i>

56:05.960 --> 56:09.646
<i>and must hope he's as well-hidden
as the local wildlife.</i>

56:11.840 --> 56:15.083
<i>Over the next five days,
Sandesh plays the role</i>

56:15.160 --> 56:16.810
<i>of human camera trap.</i>

56:19.880 --> 56:23.771
<i>Eventually, the more
hands-on approach pays off.</i>

56:50.120 --> 56:53.329
<i>Traditional filming methods
and a little bit of patience,</i>

56:53.520 --> 56:57.320
<i>have helped reveal the
hidden creatures of Kaziranga.</i>

57:03.360 --> 57:06.330
<i>But it's good to know
there are still wild places</i>

57:06.440 --> 57:09.489
<i>where animals like to keep
their secrets.</i>

57:15.760 --> 57:17.125
I knew it was elephants.

57:20.160 --> 57:21.286
<i>Next time,</i>

57:22.640 --> 57:25.371
<i>we venture to
the newest habitat on Earth,</i>

57:26.040 --> 57:27.565
<i>our cities.</i>

57:28.360 --> 57:31.250
<i>To reveal the extraordinary ways</i>

57:31.960 --> 57:35.282
<i>that animals survive
in this man-made world.</i>
