00:40.582 --> 00:42.004
Bobby, your tire is flat.

00:42.209 --> 00:42.835
I know.

00:43.043 --> 00:44.340
Well, why didn't you change it?

00:44.545 --> 00:46.843
Eh, this gets the job done.

00:50.050 --> 00:52.178
Sorry about your boy, Hank.

00:53.470 --> 00:55.893
If Bobby doesn't learn
to take care of himself,

00:55.889 --> 00:58.733
he's going to go from a kid
who can't change a bike tire

00:58.725 --> 01:01.478
to a man who can't
change a car tire.

01:01.478 --> 01:03.401
Well, maybe his wife
will be handy

01:03.564 --> 01:06.192
with that sort of thing.

01:06.191 --> 01:09.695
Did ya'll hear about
Maxine Sweeney resigning?

01:09.695 --> 01:14.326
"Arlen Welcome Wagon Lady
No Longer Welcome in Arlen.

01:14.324 --> 01:16.247
Really?
Let me see that.

01:16.243 --> 01:17.415
It says she's
been swiping coupons

01:17.578 --> 01:20.457
from the welcome baskets
for years.

01:20.455 --> 01:21.798
That's not all.

01:21.790 --> 01:24.293
I heard her husband
caught her welcoming

01:24.293 --> 01:26.466
one of the new guys in her car.

01:26.461 --> 01:30.637
Well, Maxine's humiliating
public loss is my gain.

01:30.632 --> 01:33.476
Welcome Wagon Lady
is the most prestigious

01:33.468 --> 01:35.220
volunteer position in town!

01:36.680 --> 01:40.105
With her out, this could be
the new face of Arlen.

01:41.476 --> 01:44.150
This is so much fun!

01:44.146 --> 01:49.448
Gossiping and socializing
with other married women!

01:49.443 --> 01:52.993
But that part is over now.
Lucky!

01:54.072 --> 01:58.077
Ladies, lemonade is served.

02:01.788 --> 02:06.464
Unfortunately, we have to drink
out of Lucky's bachelor glasses.

02:06.460 --> 02:10.090
I was hoping someone would
buy us real married glasses

02:10.088 --> 02:12.557
for our wedding,
but none of you did.

02:15.469 --> 02:18.313
So, Luanne and I
have decided it's time

02:18.305 --> 02:21.900
to collect our rightful
wedding gifts from everyone.

02:21.892 --> 02:24.020
Enjoy your beverages.

02:24.019 --> 02:25.441
We'll be coming for you later.

02:29.441 --> 02:31.660
Dang it!

02:34.529 --> 02:36.372
Bobby?

02:36.531 --> 02:39.000
Hey, can you grab
that cereal for me?

02:38.992 --> 02:42.087
This bread's too squishy
to knock anything down.

02:42.079 --> 02:44.377
Bobby, there's a stepladder
right there.

02:45.874 --> 02:47.171
Right.

02:48.293 --> 02:51.467
Arlen and I have
some wonderful news.

02:51.463 --> 02:55.218
I have been named our town's
new Welcome Wagon Lady.

02:55.217 --> 02:56.469
All right, Peggy.
Way to go, Mom!

02:56.468 --> 02:59.221
And I already have
my very first family.

02:59.221 --> 03:01.474
Wesley and Annette Cherish.

03:01.473 --> 03:05.068
Formerly of Fort Worth,
husband is an accountant.

03:05.060 --> 03:08.485
Wife is apparently fertile
because they have six children.

03:08.480 --> 03:10.448
What's their pet situation?

03:10.440 --> 03:11.441
Please say monkey.

03:11.441 --> 03:13.409
I do not know,
but your father and I

03:13.568 --> 03:15.445
will find out when
we visit them tomorrow.

03:15.445 --> 03:17.618
Wait. Why do I have to go?

03:17.614 --> 03:21.869
Because when I say, "Hi, I'm
Peggy Hill, and this is my..."

03:21.868 --> 03:23.586
there has to be something there.

03:26.039 --> 03:29.464
And then there's the
farmer's market every Tuesday.

03:29.459 --> 03:31.177
Now, I don't want
to give too much away,

03:31.169 --> 03:32.921
but I hope you like corn.

03:32.921 --> 03:34.468
We love corn.

03:34.464 --> 03:35.966
Boy, the way you make it sound,

03:35.966 --> 03:39.470
if Arlen wasn't in Texas,
I'd think it was in heaven.

03:39.469 --> 03:42.018
Dad, we're done
cleaning our room.

03:42.013 --> 03:43.936
Is there anything else
we can do to help?

03:43.932 --> 03:46.151
Well, you can say hello
to Mr. and Mrs. Hill.

03:46.143 --> 03:48.237
This is Robin
and Kerri, our oldest.

03:48.228 --> 03:50.196
Nice to meet you.

03:51.940 --> 03:54.363
Couple of nice boys
you got there.

03:54.359 --> 03:55.952
We think they're pretty great.

03:55.944 --> 03:57.446
We're looking to
get them involved

03:57.446 --> 03:59.369
in the Order of
the Straight Arrow.

03:59.531 --> 04:01.454
Do you know who runs
a local chapter?

04:01.450 --> 04:04.169
Well, actually,
we don't have one anymore.

04:04.161 --> 04:06.710
Once <i>American Idol</i> caught on,

04:06.705 --> 04:08.503
it got kind of tough
to schedule a meeting.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.469
But we do have many other
great children's activities.

04:12.461 --> 04:15.135
There's, uh, the-the arcade.

04:15.130 --> 04:16.928
Very popular, arcade.

04:16.923 --> 04:18.470
Oh, and the kids
love hanging out

04:18.466 --> 04:20.140
at the <i>Whattaburger</i> parking lot.

04:20.135 --> 04:22.433
Well, what on earth
do they do there?

04:23.472 --> 04:26.021
Well, break glass
bottles, mostly.

04:26.016 --> 04:27.939
Shame.

04:27.934 --> 04:30.483
You know, I'd be happy to get
the Arrow going again here

04:30.479 --> 04:31.731
if I had some help.

04:31.730 --> 04:32.652
What do you say, Hank?

04:32.647 --> 04:34.240
Want to change some lives?

04:34.232 --> 04:37.111
Well, you know, this could be
great for our son, Bobby.

04:37.110 --> 04:38.327
I'm in!

04:40.155 --> 04:42.453
See, when Arlenians put
their minds to something,

04:42.449 --> 04:44.201
there is nothing we can't do.

04:44.201 --> 04:46.124
Except for that AIDS walk.

04:46.119 --> 04:48.463
We just couldn't get that
together.

04:48.455 --> 04:51.208
I can't believe the
Straight Arrow is back!

04:51.208 --> 04:53.131
This is so exciting!

04:53.126 --> 04:55.845
Well, I'm glad it's back
for Bobby's sake.

04:55.837 --> 04:57.839
The Arrow is just
what the boy needs

04:57.839 --> 04:59.466
to learn some resourcefulness

04:59.466 --> 05:03.061
and stop being,
you know... the way he is.

05:03.053 --> 05:05.897
Well, Joseph won't be joining.

05:05.889 --> 05:09.018
Thanks to my tutelage,
he's a level six survivalist.

05:09.017 --> 05:12.442
He's been trained to use boys
like yours as food and shelter.

05:13.480 --> 05:16.700
Check out
these handsome fellas.

05:16.691 --> 05:20.821
Look how happy I was there.

05:20.821 --> 05:23.119
That little guy didn't know
what was going to hit him.

05:23.114 --> 05:25.367
Hey, look, it's my
old Arrow knife.

05:25.367 --> 05:28.211
This fellow helped me
make a fishing pole,

05:28.203 --> 05:30.456
cut more twine
than I can remember.

05:30.455 --> 05:33.425
Now Bobby will get to do
all those things, too.

05:33.583 --> 05:35.551
No!

05:39.464 --> 05:41.387
Hello, former wedding guest.

05:41.383 --> 05:46.480
As you may recall, Luanne and I
were bonded in holy matrimony,

05:46.471 --> 05:49.600
and you were there
to witness said event.

05:49.599 --> 05:52.478
Oh, yes, beautiful ceremony.

05:52.477 --> 05:54.195
You didn't get us a gift!

05:54.187 --> 05:56.155
Uh, sure I did.

05:56.147 --> 05:58.320
I got you... a star!

05:58.316 --> 06:00.444
But I can't eat off a star!

06:00.443 --> 06:03.367
The Gribbles prefer a
romantic gift to the practical.

06:03.363 --> 06:05.115
Point is, our obligation
is fulfilled.

06:05.115 --> 06:07.083
I'll be awaiting
your thank-you note.

06:12.956 --> 06:16.210
We're going to need
to change our strategy.

06:18.295 --> 06:20.468
Greetings, fellow troopers!

06:20.463 --> 06:22.056
I'm Arrowmaster Wesley.

06:22.048 --> 06:23.721
Who's ready to have some fun?

06:25.468 --> 06:28.096
And who's ready to learn
some self-reliance?

06:28.096 --> 06:30.770
Huh?

06:30.765 --> 06:33.188
Assistant Arrowmaster Hank
is right.

06:33.184 --> 06:34.481
The Arrow is going to teach you

06:34.477 --> 06:36.900
to be courageous,
independent men.

06:36.897 --> 06:39.650
And we're going start by
building our first fire.

06:39.649 --> 06:42.778
All right, let's get outside
and collect some wood.

06:42.777 --> 06:44.450
Oh, that's not necessary, Hank.

06:44.446 --> 06:45.868
We're building them right here.

06:45.864 --> 06:46.865
Inside?

06:48.241 --> 06:50.414
Building a fire
is like building a house.

06:50.577 --> 06:53.000
You start
with a strong foundation.

06:52.996 --> 06:55.465
Then come the walls
and the roof,

06:55.457 --> 06:59.303
and finally a family of flame
to live inside.

06:59.294 --> 07:01.422
Whoosh!

07:05.216 --> 07:07.435
Okay, troopers,
now it's your turn.

07:09.471 --> 07:12.395
That was, uh, creative.

07:12.390 --> 07:14.108
But don't you think
the kids should learn

07:14.100 --> 07:16.603
how to, you know,
make a real fire?

07:16.603 --> 07:19.231
Oh, no, Hank,
that's too dangerous.

07:19.230 --> 07:21.073
Do you want Bobby to get burned?

07:21.066 --> 07:23.034
I don't know. Maybe a little.

07:23.026 --> 07:25.245
You're funny.

07:25.236 --> 07:27.659
Hey, what do you say we hand out
the Arrow knives?

07:27.656 --> 07:29.658
Oh, good, the knives.

07:30.617 --> 07:32.460
What the heck is this?

07:32.452 --> 07:33.624
Great, huh?

07:33.620 --> 07:35.418
Well, it's a toy.

07:35.413 --> 07:36.835
Hey, Dad, look!

07:36.831 --> 07:39.425
My fire's roaring!

07:47.133 --> 07:50.854
Hey, Mom, Straight Arrow
is the best.

07:50.845 --> 07:52.472
Everyone's super nice

07:52.472 --> 07:56.477
and we made these cool replica
Native American necklaces.

07:56.476 --> 07:58.444
Oh, it's very pretty, honey.

08:00.397 --> 08:03.241
Sounds like Bobby
had a great time today.

08:03.233 --> 08:05.110
But don't Indian necklaces
usually have

08:05.110 --> 08:07.283
an eagle claw or a bear tooth?

08:07.278 --> 08:10.202
Wesley thought
they were too pointy.

08:11.324 --> 08:13.918
Something about
that guy seems off.

08:13.910 --> 08:16.459
He had the kids
build a fake fire.

08:16.454 --> 08:18.081
It was just lame.

08:18.081 --> 08:19.674
Did you say that to him?

08:19.666 --> 08:21.259
Is he upset?
Is he moving?!

08:21.251 --> 08:22.628
I just welcomed him!

08:22.627 --> 08:25.426
Well, I didn't say anything,
but I feel like I should.

08:25.588 --> 08:29.058
The last thing Bobby needs
is more "pretend" time.

08:34.472 --> 08:35.472
Hey, Hank.

08:35.472 --> 08:37.475
Boy, this was a
great idea you had,

08:37.475 --> 08:40.479
sitting down for a little
Arrow brainstorming session.

08:40.477 --> 08:42.446
Well, we owe it to the kids

08:42.438 --> 08:45.909
to plan some, you know...
useful activities.

08:45.900 --> 08:48.323
Come on. Let's powwow
in the TV room.

08:48.319 --> 08:50.538
Annette's home-schooling
in the den.

08:54.034 --> 08:57.755
This is the TV room?
I don't see a TV.

08:59.456 --> 09:01.458
But... how do you
watch the game?

09:01.458 --> 09:03.005
The football game?

09:03.001 --> 09:04.378
Oh, no.

09:04.377 --> 09:07.221
We discourage the kids
from predatorial sports

09:07.213 --> 09:09.932
like football, basketball, tag.

09:09.924 --> 09:14.896
Uh, so I was thinking we could
do a lesson on tying knots.

09:14.888 --> 09:16.765
Then we could use them
to make something fun,

09:16.765 --> 09:18.312
like a bow and arrow.

09:18.308 --> 09:21.653
Whoa, bow and arrow is a
little too "hunty-killy."

09:21.644 --> 09:22.611
Don't you think?

09:23.897 --> 09:25.695
But you know what we could make?

09:25.690 --> 09:27.442
A dreamcatcher.

09:27.442 --> 09:29.786
Yeah, that sounds awful.

09:29.778 --> 09:32.406
You know, Wesley, back when I
was in the Straight Arrow,

09:32.572 --> 09:35.291
we did a lot more
"active" activities.

09:35.283 --> 09:36.455
Well, the kids
are still learning

09:36.451 --> 09:38.169
the same skills we did, Hank.

09:38.161 --> 09:40.459
Just in a safe,
controlled environment.

09:40.455 --> 09:41.957
No risk, no danger.

09:41.956 --> 09:43.924
But...
Daddy!

09:45.085 --> 09:47.634
During recess we usually
take a family walk.

09:49.464 --> 09:52.434
Would you like to join us?

09:53.468 --> 09:55.436
Nope, uh, I'm good.

10:05.980 --> 10:07.823
We've come for
our blender, Kahn.

10:07.816 --> 10:10.911
I want to crush ice
with the touch of a button!

10:10.902 --> 10:12.449
Have you been huffing paint?

10:12.445 --> 10:14.038
It's 3:00
in the morning!

10:14.030 --> 10:16.283
You didn't get us
a wedding gift,

10:16.282 --> 10:18.000
so, now, we're here to collect.

10:17.992 --> 10:21.121
Look, we have a year
to buy you a gift.

10:21.121 --> 10:23.465
And, how should I
put this delicately?

10:23.456 --> 10:25.675
We don't think your
hillbilly marriage

10:25.667 --> 10:26.884
going to last that long.

10:26.876 --> 10:28.378
Come back in a few months.

10:28.378 --> 10:32.724
We're not leaving
without our small appliance.

10:34.175 --> 10:37.429
Oh, would you like it
in chrome or buttercup yellow?

10:44.018 --> 10:47.147
He didn't even allow you
the dignity of pants.

10:47.147 --> 10:49.445
I hate this Wesley guy.

10:49.440 --> 10:51.989
You know what we're doing
instead of a campout?

10:51.985 --> 10:53.407
A "camp-in."

10:53.403 --> 10:56.156
Apparently, the woods
are too unpredictable,

10:56.156 --> 10:58.454
so we're spending the night
at the library.

10:58.449 --> 11:00.167
Man, that dang ol'
disgraceful, man.

11:00.160 --> 11:02.458
Talkin' 'bout won't
let kids be kids, man.

11:02.453 --> 11:05.457
Exactly. Kids are supposed
to get dirty and get hurt.

11:05.456 --> 11:06.708
We did.

11:06.708 --> 11:09.461
Sure, we cut ourselves
and burned ourselves,

11:09.460 --> 11:13.181
but that's how we learned
things were sharp and hot.

11:13.173 --> 11:14.891
And we turned out all right.

11:14.883 --> 11:17.056
Except for Boomhauer's
pinky toe,

11:17.051 --> 11:18.803
wherever she may be.

11:26.019 --> 11:27.817
Wematanya, guys.

11:27.812 --> 11:30.440
Wematanya, Bobby.
Wematanya, Bobby.

11:30.440 --> 11:31.987
Wematanya, Hank.

11:31.983 --> 11:33.610
Hi, Wesley.

11:33.610 --> 11:36.454
You guys will not believe
what I did last night.

11:36.446 --> 11:40.121
<i>Face Kicker 3,</i> level 15.
I owned it.

11:40.116 --> 11:41.459
All right, Bobby.

11:41.451 --> 11:42.452
That's awesome!

11:42.452 --> 11:44.079
What's <i>Face Kicker 3?</i>

11:44.078 --> 11:46.706
Only the best video game ever.

11:46.706 --> 11:49.300
Oh, we don't have
any video games.

11:49.292 --> 11:51.135
Wait, you don't have any...

11:51.127 --> 11:53.846
You guys have got
to see this right now.

11:55.465 --> 11:57.467
That should do it.

11:57.467 --> 11:58.889
We should probably
get on the road

11:58.885 --> 12:00.637
so we have time to
stretch our hammies.

12:00.637 --> 12:01.980
Go, Bobby! Kick him!

12:01.971 --> 12:03.063
Double-kick him.

12:08.353 --> 12:10.151
What is the matter with you?

12:10.146 --> 12:11.318
I don't understand.

12:11.314 --> 12:12.440
What did I do?

12:12.440 --> 12:15.444
How could you expose
the troop to this garbage?

12:15.443 --> 12:17.320
You're a bad influence, Bobby,

12:17.320 --> 12:18.697
and I won't have that here.

12:18.696 --> 12:20.198
Hey, back off, Wesley.

12:20.198 --> 12:22.246
Don't talk to my son like that.

12:22.242 --> 12:24.461
Kids, get in the van.

12:24.452 --> 12:27.126
Maybe violence is acceptable
in your household, Hank,

12:27.121 --> 12:28.418
but it isn't here.

12:37.465 --> 12:40.469
Where does he get off
criticizing our son like that?

12:40.468 --> 12:43.312
That's what you do at home
behind people's backs.

12:43.304 --> 12:45.477
Bobby is a good, normal kid.

12:45.473 --> 12:47.350
Not like his little weirdos.

12:47.350 --> 12:49.569
Has Arrowmaster Wesley called?

12:49.560 --> 12:51.358
Am I kicked out of the troop?

12:51.354 --> 12:53.903
The not knowing is killing me.

12:53.898 --> 12:55.900
You know, Bobby,
maybe it's for the best

12:55.900 --> 12:57.368
if you don't go back.

12:57.360 --> 12:59.454
But I need the Arrow, Dad.

12:59.445 --> 13:02.039
Arrowmaster
Wesley was right.

13:02.031 --> 13:03.999
My video games are violent.

13:03.992 --> 13:07.462
Making all these faces explode
can't be good for me.

13:07.453 --> 13:08.955
Oh, sure it can, sweetie.

13:10.039 --> 13:12.212
Dad, tell Arrowmaster Wesley

13:12.208 --> 13:14.757
I'll do whatever it takes
to stay in the troop.

13:14.752 --> 13:16.800
Here, destroy this

13:16.796 --> 13:19.595
before it destroys anyone else.

13:22.552 --> 13:25.476
How could Wesley
bad-mouth Bobby like that?

13:25.471 --> 13:26.973
I'm as mad as if...

13:26.973 --> 13:29.442
as if someone made fun
of my own son...

13:29.434 --> 13:31.482
which I don't have, which...

13:31.477 --> 13:33.354
it makes me even more mad!

13:33.354 --> 13:35.448
And now he's got Bobby on board

13:35.440 --> 13:37.613
with his asinine way
of thinking.

13:37.608 --> 13:39.406
What those kids need is a taste

13:39.402 --> 13:41.279
of what the Arrow
used to be like.

13:41.279 --> 13:44.203
What we got to do is get
that man out of the picture.

13:44.198 --> 13:45.450
Let's see.

13:45.450 --> 13:47.248
Uh, too complicated...

13:47.243 --> 13:48.870
too messy...

13:48.870 --> 13:50.622
we'd need a lion.

13:50.621 --> 13:52.214
Hey, I think I know a way.

13:52.206 --> 13:56.052
I'll offer to chaperone a shift
of the Arrow camp-in.

13:56.044 --> 13:57.466
When Wesley isn't around,

13:57.462 --> 13:59.260
the kids can finally experience

13:59.255 --> 14:01.474
some good-natured
Arrow mischief.

14:01.466 --> 14:02.467
I like mischief.

14:02.467 --> 14:03.468
I want to help.

14:03.468 --> 14:04.390
Me, too.

14:04.552 --> 14:06.395
If I can reach just one child

14:06.554 --> 14:08.227
through candy and matches,

14:08.222 --> 14:11.317
it'll all have been worthwhile.

14:20.443 --> 14:21.945
Oh, no, campers.

14:21.944 --> 14:24.447
A hungry bear
has entered our campsite.

14:24.447 --> 14:25.869
What do we do?

14:26.783 --> 14:28.831
Make yourself big and noisy.

14:32.872 --> 14:33.998
Well done.

14:33.998 --> 14:35.841
You scared that bear away.

14:37.293 --> 14:38.715
Isn't this fun, Hank?

14:38.711 --> 14:41.305
Oh, I'm so glad you
came around to our side.

14:41.297 --> 14:42.765
I think you'll see Bobby

14:42.757 --> 14:45.385
will really benefit
from this environment.

14:45.385 --> 14:46.477
Well, look at that.

14:46.469 --> 14:47.391
Time for you to go.

14:47.553 --> 14:49.476
Already? Wow.

14:49.472 --> 14:51.474
Thanks again for taking
the midnight shift.

14:51.474 --> 14:54.478
The kids say the family bed
seems empty without me.

14:54.477 --> 14:56.070
See you in the AM.

15:03.945 --> 15:05.413
He's gone.

15:05.571 --> 15:07.198
Put down those books, kids.

15:07.198 --> 15:08.324
We're gonna show you

15:08.324 --> 15:11.328
what an Arrow campout
was like in my day.

15:11.327 --> 15:15.457
Dad, this isn't part of
Arrowmaster Wesley's itinerary.

15:15.456 --> 15:17.925
Campouts don't have itineraries.

15:51.617 --> 15:53.790
Now, this is a campout.

15:53.786 --> 15:56.460
Hey!

15:56.456 --> 15:58.834
You know, we should let them
run around the parking lot.

15:58.833 --> 16:01.177
Running on asphalt.

16:01.169 --> 16:03.263
Oh, Wesley would love that.

16:04.338 --> 16:05.464
Go on, now.

16:05.465 --> 16:08.218
Remember, you're not having fun
unless you get dirty.

16:09.886 --> 16:12.480
Uh, hey, guys,
that's far enough.

16:12.472 --> 16:14.224
Yeah, come on!

16:20.771 --> 16:22.114
Robin, Kerri!

16:22.106 --> 16:23.824
Ah, dang it, they're gone.

16:23.816 --> 16:26.319
Well, we've still
got five kids left.

16:26.319 --> 16:28.196
That's something.

16:28.196 --> 16:30.699
We have to find them,
and we have to do it fast,

16:30.698 --> 16:33.292
because Wesley
is due back here in an hour.

16:33.284 --> 16:35.912
Okay, boys, go grab your gear.

16:35.912 --> 16:37.414
You're coming with me.

16:37.580 --> 16:38.923
Peggy,

16:38.915 --> 16:41.964
you stay here in case
Robin and Kerri come back.

16:41.959 --> 16:43.927
Guys, I need you to stall Wesley

16:43.920 --> 16:45.888
at his house
to give me as much time

16:45.880 --> 16:48.474
as possible to find
his crazy kids.

16:48.466 --> 16:49.718
Can do.

16:49.717 --> 16:51.344
You bet.

16:51.344 --> 16:53.472
Are you sure about this, Dad?

16:53.471 --> 16:55.223
There's no way we can find them.

16:55.223 --> 16:56.475
We'll get lost.

16:56.474 --> 16:59.273
Then the people who come looking
for us will get lost,

16:59.268 --> 17:01.066
and we'll lose half the town.

17:01.062 --> 17:03.315
Don't worry, son.
No one's getting lost.

17:03.314 --> 17:04.406
We're gonna track them.

17:04.565 --> 17:07.444
Everything that moves through
the woods leaves a trail,

17:07.443 --> 17:10.287
whether you're a deer
or a 13-year-old boy.

17:10.279 --> 17:11.656
So start looking for signs

17:11.656 --> 17:12.999
like crushed grass,

17:12.990 --> 17:14.992
broken branches, footprints...

17:14.992 --> 17:16.117
What about frosting?

17:17.453 --> 17:18.500
Good eye, son.

17:19.704 --> 17:21.457
Okay, they headed this way.

17:21.457 --> 17:23.050
Let's go.

17:25.461 --> 17:27.930
Fried baloney served on silver.

17:27.922 --> 17:31.222
We are midnight-snacking
like kings.

17:31.217 --> 17:34.187
You know, I celebrated
my birthday last month

17:34.178 --> 17:37.307
and was very disappointed
with the gift response.

17:37.306 --> 17:38.307
You make a list.

17:38.307 --> 17:39.433
I'll call the boys.

17:41.269 --> 17:43.863
Dang it. I
lost the trail.

17:43.854 --> 17:46.983
What we need is a high
vantage point, so we

17:46.983 --> 17:48.235
can see Robin and Kerri.

17:48.234 --> 17:49.451
If we climb this tree,

17:49.443 --> 17:50.695
we might be able to spot them.

17:50.695 --> 17:52.288
But Arrowmaster Wesley

17:52.280 --> 17:54.453
says climbing
only leads to falling.

17:54.448 --> 17:55.916
Not if you're smart about it.

17:55.908 --> 17:57.376
I'll do it.

17:57.535 --> 17:59.879
Great.

17:59.870 --> 18:02.464
Now, remember,
climb with your legs

18:02.456 --> 18:04.879
and be sure of your footing.

18:07.545 --> 18:08.888
I see them!

18:08.879 --> 18:11.473
Okay, take out your compass
and give us a heading.

18:11.465 --> 18:13.058
Uh... east.

18:14.552 --> 18:15.769
That way.

18:19.932 --> 18:21.934
So, what's the plan, Dale?

18:21.934 --> 18:24.483
The old distressed
motorist routine.

18:24.478 --> 18:26.901
We'll tell Wesley
our van is broken.

18:26.897 --> 18:29.446
He'll undoubtedly invite us in
to use the phone

18:29.442 --> 18:31.444
and then offer us
a cup of cocoa,

18:31.444 --> 18:35.199
giving Hank plenty of time
to secure the rogue brothers.

18:36.449 --> 18:38.247
Yo, man, heads
up, here-here-here...

18:38.242 --> 18:39.619
here he come, man.

18:41.954 --> 18:43.376
Excuse me...

18:49.128 --> 18:50.471
It burns!

18:50.463 --> 18:53.433
It burns so much!

18:55.468 --> 18:56.811
Quiet, I think I
heard something.

19:02.391 --> 19:03.734
It's them.

19:05.478 --> 19:07.480
Now, we can't just
jump out like that.

19:07.480 --> 19:08.402
We'll risk scaring them off.

19:08.564 --> 19:10.157
If we want to catch those two,

19:10.149 --> 19:11.992
we have to get them
to come to us.

19:11.984 --> 19:14.407
Like the way my grandpa uses a
duck call when he goes hunting?

19:14.570 --> 19:17.449
Well, exactly,
but a duck call for kids.

19:17.448 --> 19:20.827
Dad, I've got an idea.

19:24.455 --> 19:26.082
Yeah, you're toast!

19:26.082 --> 19:29.461
Shh... is that Bobby
playing Face Kicker?

19:29.460 --> 19:31.383
What's he doing out here?

19:31.379 --> 19:32.631
Who cares?

19:32.630 --> 19:34.678
I want to kick some faces.

19:36.717 --> 19:39.436
Okay, boys, fun's over.

19:44.684 --> 19:46.436
My boys!

19:47.478 --> 19:48.479
Oh, Robbie, Kay-Kay,

19:48.479 --> 19:50.322
are you all right?

19:50.314 --> 19:51.440
The kids are fine.

19:51.440 --> 19:53.363
We were just outside
getting some fresh air

19:53.526 --> 19:56.325
and, uh, you know,
listening to the crickets.

19:56.320 --> 19:57.321
Sorry, Hank.

19:57.321 --> 19:59.039
We told him everything.

19:59.031 --> 20:00.283
He wouldn't stop spraying.

20:00.282 --> 20:02.751
How could you be
so irresponsible,

20:02.743 --> 20:06.122
letting these boys run
around and eat cupcakes

20:06.122 --> 20:08.090
like a pack of wild animals?

20:08.082 --> 20:09.299
Irresponsible?

20:09.291 --> 20:10.759
I let them outside.

20:10.751 --> 20:12.094
I gave them some sugar.

20:12.086 --> 20:13.087
So what?

20:13.087 --> 20:14.634
They needed to have some fun.

20:14.630 --> 20:17.474
Oh, so you think you know
what's best for my kids?

20:17.466 --> 20:20.015
Robin has ADHD.

20:20.010 --> 20:22.433
And Kerri's hyperglycemic.

20:24.640 --> 20:28.144
Uh, sorry about the, uh, fun.

20:28.144 --> 20:29.487
How I raise my children

20:29.478 --> 20:31.446
is my business, not yours.

20:31.439 --> 20:33.407
Come on, boys,
let's get you home

20:33.566 --> 20:35.739
and check you for ticks.

20:38.446 --> 20:39.663
Huh.

20:39.655 --> 20:42.124
He, uh, has some good points.

20:42.116 --> 20:43.789
I feel terrible, Hank.

20:43.784 --> 20:45.707
I had no idea
how emotionally involved

20:45.703 --> 20:48.331
I'd become
with my Welcome Wagon families.

20:48.330 --> 20:49.752
I cannot take the stress.

20:49.749 --> 20:50.966
I am out.

20:52.460 --> 20:55.430
Hey, Dad, we want to
learn more cool Arrow stuff,

20:55.421 --> 20:57.469
like what you taught us
in the woods.

20:57.465 --> 20:59.092
Totally. Please. Yeah.

20:59.091 --> 21:00.468
We brought back some sticks.

21:00.468 --> 21:01.970
Can we make something
fun with them?

21:03.053 --> 21:04.396
Well, sure.

21:04.555 --> 21:06.853
How about we whittle
a fishing spear.

21:06.849 --> 21:08.396
Here, you'll need this.

21:08.559 --> 21:10.482
Cool.

21:10.478 --> 21:13.106
<i>Now, remember, when
you open a pocketknife,</i>

21:13.105 --> 21:14.448
<i>you need to keep your hand...</i>

21:14.440 --> 21:15.441
<i>Ow!</i>

21:15.441 --> 21:16.442
<i>Are you okay?</i>

21:16.442 --> 21:18.035
<i>Uh, you might want</i>

21:18.027 --> 21:20.029
<i>to hold your hand
above your head.</i>

21:54.313 --> 21:56.407
<i>It burns so much!</i>
