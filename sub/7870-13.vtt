12:39.049 --> 12:43.012
Hmm, the French have gotten
into the wine game?

12:43.095 --> 12:45.639
Ha, good luck catchin' up
with the big boys.

12:45.723 --> 12:47.641
I'll get a couple glasses.

12:49.310 --> 12:51.729
Mrs. Simpson, I'd like your permission
to take your daughter

12:51.812 --> 12:54.231
to the Doritos Nutrition Fair
at the school gym.

12:54.315 --> 12:58.611
Well, I usually take Lisa,
but I can just go with Bart.

12:58.694 --> 13:00.237
Wait. What? No!

13:00.321 --> 13:01.572
You're going with me!

13:01.655 --> 13:03.115
But, Lisa, after this,

13:03.199 --> 13:06.327
I don't want you to spend
so much time with this boy.

13:06.410 --> 13:09.955
If you do, it'll mean you're
a separate person from me.

13:10.039 --> 13:12.166
<i>That'll stop her</i>
<i>from seeing him.</i>

13:19.423 --> 13:21.842
Mom can't appreciate
the kind of boy Nick is,

13:21.926 --> 13:23.302
because although I love Dad,

13:23.385 --> 13:25.596
he's a completely
different creature.

13:25.679 --> 13:27.932
Yeah, there's a lot
of fish in the sea,

13:28.015 --> 13:30.059
but she picked out
a drunken walrus.

13:30.142 --> 13:31.852
But you and this Nick fella
sound to me

13:31.936 --> 13:34.855
like the story
of Pyramus and Thisbe.

13:34.939 --> 13:36.607
Which inspired
<i>Romeo and Juliet,</i>

13:36.690 --> 13:38.400
which inspired
<i>West Side Story,</i>

13:38.484 --> 13:40.903
which inspired me to say "eh."

13:40.986 --> 13:44.907
Pyramus and Thisbe were
lovers from ancient times!

13:44.990 --> 13:48.661
<i>They lived next door but their</i>
<i>families despised each other.</i>

13:48.744 --> 13:52.081
I don't like to babble on,
but I sure do like Babylon.

13:52.164 --> 13:54.083
(gurgling)

13:56.210 --> 13:58.587
<i>The lovers had to whisper</i>
<i>their sweet nothings</i>

13:58.671 --> 14:00.297
<i>through a crack in the wall.</i>

14:00.381 --> 14:01.465
<i>LISA:</i>
<i>Wait a minute!</i>

14:01.549 --> 14:06.011
Nick and I met talking through
a crack between two booths!

14:06.095 --> 14:09.056
<i>ABE: And the power of that</i>
<i>forbidden smooch</i>

14:09.139 --> 14:12.017
<i>made them love</i>
<i>each other forever.</i>

14:14.019 --> 14:16.397
(grunting)

14:16.480 --> 14:17.857
(laughing)

14:18.858 --> 14:21.443
<i>LISA: Man, that company</i>
<i>thinks every time</i>

14:21.527 --> 14:24.363
<i>it adds a wisecracking parrot</i>
<i>to a story, they own it.</i>

14:24.446 --> 14:26.240
Talk to the wing, Thisbe!

14:26.323 --> 14:30.744
Grampa, would you help take me
on a foolish romantic mission?

14:30.828 --> 14:32.371
Let me check my schedule.

14:32.454 --> 14:33.581
This might work.

14:33.664 --> 14:34.707
I think I'm free.

14:34.790 --> 14:36.041
Tuesday's open.

14:36.125 --> 14:38.127
You got it, kiddo!

14:40.796 --> 14:43.632
Legend has it
a girl named Eleanor Mackie

14:43.716 --> 14:45.551
drowned on this very spot.

14:45.634 --> 14:47.845
Now they say if you
call her name three times

14:47.928 --> 14:50.890
while looking in this mirror,
you will die.

14:50.973 --> 14:52.308
Milhouse?

14:56.353 --> 14:58.480
(sighs)

14:58.564 --> 15:01.692
Eleanor Mackie.
Eleanor Mackie.

15:01.775 --> 15:03.819
-Eleanor Mackie!
-(all scream)

15:03.903 --> 15:06.155
Aw, gimme a break.

15:06.238 --> 15:09.950
The one day the lunch lady
decides to wash her hands.

15:10.034 --> 15:12.870
Okay, that was
the last school myth

15:12.953 --> 15:14.747
and it's officially cracked.

15:14.830 --> 15:18.000
So, school is just
everything we see?

15:18.083 --> 15:20.294
That's sad, man.

15:20.377 --> 15:22.588
(dejected sighs)

15:25.132 --> 15:26.717
You into cigars now?

15:26.800 --> 15:28.719
It's a Twix.

15:28.802 --> 15:30.721
I can't be the guy who
killed everybody's fun.

15:30.804 --> 15:32.222
That's Skinner's job.

15:32.306 --> 15:35.935
Don't blame me.
You killed the fun, fun-killer.

15:36.018 --> 15:37.728
(yawning)

15:37.811 --> 15:39.688
(growls)

15:39.772 --> 15:42.566
Milhouse, I've just figured out
a way to make school cool again.

15:42.650 --> 15:44.944
American Girl doll day?!

15:45.027 --> 15:46.403
You might be surprised at

15:46.487 --> 15:49.531
the number of boys who have
American Girl dolls.

15:49.615 --> 15:52.368
It's not weird 'cause
they're historic figures.

15:52.451 --> 15:53.452
(groaning)

15:53.535 --> 15:54.620
(growling)

15:54.703 --> 15:56.121
(yelps)

15:57.456 --> 16:00.084
I have found one
last myth to destroy,

16:00.167 --> 16:04.296
the so-called legend of
Groundskeeper Were-Willie.

16:04.380 --> 16:07.299
Prepare to be disappointed!

16:08.884 --> 16:10.928
(moans)

16:11.011 --> 16:14.139
(howling)

16:14.223 --> 16:16.225
(all screaming)

16:16.308 --> 16:19.395
Gentlemen,
we just created a myth.

16:19.478 --> 16:22.898
Now there's a myth about me
I'd like you to correct--

16:22.982 --> 16:25.109
I'm not from Edinburgh!

16:25.192 --> 16:27.903
I'm also not from Glasgow!

16:27.987 --> 16:30.614
I'm from Kirkwall in Orkney!

16:30.698 --> 16:33.701
Me father was an Uppie,
and me mother was a Doonie.

16:33.784 --> 16:35.536
It tore the
family apart!

16:35.619 --> 16:38.038
(sobbing)

16:44.420 --> 16:47.339
-(police siren wails)
-Ow!

16:48.882 --> 16:52.845
Pull over. You're wanted for
grand theft retirement home.

16:52.928 --> 16:55.097
The TV remote is in your pocket!

16:55.180 --> 16:57.182
<i>(on TV):</i>
<i>Hola! Yo soy Maury Povich.</i>

16:57.266 --> 16:59.309
<i>Uno de estos siete hombres es</i>

16:59.393 --> 17:02.730
<i>el verdadero padre de este</i>
<i>"crack baby."</i>

17:02.813 --> 17:05.107
Everyone's speaking Spanish!

17:05.190 --> 17:08.110
But, if we stop now, we'll never
make it there by sunset.

17:09.862 --> 17:11.447
Run, young lovers!

17:11.530 --> 17:12.698
I'll take care
of the cops!

17:12.781 --> 17:14.783
-But, Grampa...
-Go ahead!

17:14.867 --> 17:16.577
I ain't afraid of no prison!

17:17.828 --> 17:19.913
(grunts angrily)

17:19.997 --> 17:22.916
Sir, we're gonna bring you back
to your retirement home.

17:23.000 --> 17:25.210
No!

17:26.712 --> 17:28.213
(gunfire)

17:28.297 --> 17:29.256
Chief, we heard gunfire!

17:29.339 --> 17:31.675
Relax!
It's just my back!

17:31.759 --> 17:33.010
-(gunshot)
-And my hip.

17:33.093 --> 17:34.720
-(gunshot)
-Spinal column!

17:34.803 --> 17:36.555
(gunshot)

17:40.642 --> 17:42.311
Thanks for the ride,
Mr. Spuckler.

17:42.394 --> 17:45.397
Yeah, I don't normally
approve of out-breeding,

17:45.481 --> 17:47.608
but you two seem nice.

17:48.817 --> 17:50.569
We can take this boat.

17:56.408 --> 17:58.660
I don't know,
this water's a little choppy.

17:58.744 --> 18:01.830
I thought you rowed up the Zambezi
without a guide.

18:01.914 --> 18:03.707
Right, right.

18:05.417 --> 18:07.753
(sighs)

18:10.214 --> 18:13.550
So, Dad, what kind of stupid idea
did you put in Lisa's head?

18:13.634 --> 18:17.930
She wants to steal a kiss,
like Pyramus and Thisbe.

18:18.013 --> 18:19.681
Did you say
"ultimate Frisbee"?!

18:19.765 --> 18:21.141
-No!
-Oh...

18:24.394 --> 18:26.814
(annoyed whining)

18:29.650 --> 18:31.693
(grunting)

18:40.077 --> 18:42.162
Women and shoes, am I right?

18:42.246 --> 18:44.665
(grunting)

18:49.378 --> 18:51.755
Your hands are really cold.

18:53.048 --> 18:56.885
You know, you were a lot more adventurous
at the dessert table.

18:56.969 --> 18:58.887
I sure was--
I'm allergic to chocolate!

18:58.971 --> 19:00.722
Shut up and kiss me.

19:03.725 --> 19:06.979
<i>Lisa, it's Hadley Richardson,</i>
<i>Hemingway's first wife.</i>

19:07.062 --> 19:09.523
<i>Trust me,</i>
<i>you're making a big mistake.</i>

19:09.606 --> 19:12.234
<i>If you don't believe me,</i>
<i>ask Pauline Pfeiffer.</i>

19:12.317 --> 19:14.027
<i>I was his second wife.</i>

19:14.111 --> 19:16.029
<i>There were two more after me.</i>

19:16.113 --> 19:18.657
<i>Tortured writers</i>
<i>make horrible husbands.</i>

19:18.740 --> 19:20.742
<i>At least you chose</i>
<i>to be with him.</i>

19:20.826 --> 19:23.954
<i>I was just swimmin' along,</i>
<i>mindin' my own business.</i>

19:24.037 --> 19:26.373
<i>Next thing I know,</i>
<i>I was hanging on his wall!</i>

19:26.456 --> 19:28.375
<i>He used to pee</i>
<i>in the fireplace!</i>

19:28.458 --> 19:29.668
<i>(sobbing)</i>

19:30.460 --> 19:32.796
Wait, how long
is this love for again?

19:32.880 --> 19:34.047
Eternity.

19:34.131 --> 19:36.300
Oh, that's a pretty
long time.

19:36.383 --> 19:39.094
Now my lips
are getting cold.

19:39.178 --> 19:41.471
(panting)
Lisa!

19:42.431 --> 19:44.516
This isn't working out.

19:44.600 --> 19:46.894
Lisa, I'm sorry that
God gave me this gift

19:46.977 --> 19:49.438
of lying to girls,
for a little while.

19:49.521 --> 19:50.856
I'll see ya.

19:53.442 --> 19:54.693
(panting)

19:54.776 --> 19:58.030
I feel kinda silly I walked
all the way out here.

19:58.113 --> 20:01.283
You're just fine.
You always are.

20:01.366 --> 20:03.952
Thanks.
But I couldn't do it, Mom.

20:04.036 --> 20:06.496
I mean, the person you kiss
under a mulberry tree

20:06.580 --> 20:09.374
is someone you'll love
for the rest of your life.

20:14.004 --> 20:16.465
Mwah!

20:19.635 --> 20:21.553
(grunting)

20:21.637 --> 20:23.805
Don't worry, ladies,
I'm-a comin'!

20:23.889 --> 20:25.182
D'oh!

20:25.265 --> 20:27.059
(gurgling)
D'oh...

20:33.649 --> 20:36.485
You know, I heard
if a fat guy stops moving,

20:36.568 --> 20:38.570
he floats.

20:38.654 --> 20:40.447
D'oh!

21:22.489 --> 21:24.199
Shh!
