00:01.635 --> 00:04.338
DANNY:
Previously on Blue Bloods...
Philip Sanfino, that's your guy.

00:04.372 --> 00:05.639
Lieutenant,
so we're clear, um,

00:05.673 --> 00:07.408
I'm not committing
to a career undercover.

00:07.441 --> 00:09.210
You're giving off
some sort of cop scent.

00:09.243 --> 00:10.411
What the hell
is that supposed to me?

00:10.444 --> 00:11.745
Well, my uncle Phil
wants to talk

00:11.779 --> 00:12.713
to you himself,
and you're coming in.

00:12.746 --> 00:14.782
Phil, let's just talk
to him inside, okay?

00:14.815 --> 00:17.051
If I want your opinion,
I'll ask you for it.

00:17.085 --> 00:18.319
Now get inside and wait.

00:18.352 --> 00:20.221
Get him out of the car.
All right, all right,

00:20.254 --> 00:21.489
I got some things
to say, but...

00:23.191 --> 00:25.426
James Riordan, you're wanted
for questioning in the murder

00:25.459 --> 00:26.360
of one Johnny Tesla.

00:26.394 --> 00:27.161
You want to come with us.

00:27.195 --> 00:27.961
You have the right
to remain silent.

00:27.995 --> 00:31.065
If you refuse to
answer questions....

00:43.244 --> 00:44.812
Oh, come on,
let's go.

00:44.845 --> 00:46.480
You're seeing a doctor.

00:46.514 --> 00:48.249
End of story.

00:48.282 --> 00:49.817
(groans)

00:49.850 --> 00:50.851
I just need a roll of Tums.

00:50.884 --> 00:52.253
Listen, that's the third time

00:52.286 --> 00:53.521
you've had the stomachache
this week, okay?

00:53.554 --> 00:54.822
And don't say it was something
you ate,

00:54.855 --> 00:56.824
'cause I know what you ate;
you had ginger ale

00:56.857 --> 00:58.092
and pretzels for dinner.

00:58.126 --> 01:00.294
What, are you a doctor now?

01:00.328 --> 01:01.662
No, I'm not a doctor,

01:01.695 --> 01:02.896
but you have a
high-stress job,

01:02.930 --> 01:06.167
you live alone, you have no
family that you see regularly,

01:06.200 --> 01:07.768
no pets, no sports,
no hobbies.

01:07.801 --> 01:10.604
I think you're a cover girl
for Ulcers Illustrated.

01:10.638 --> 01:12.306
That's lovely, thank you.

01:12.340 --> 01:14.475
The swimsuit issue
is what I meant.
Oh, right.

01:14.508 --> 01:16.210
Definitely the
swimsuit issue.

01:16.244 --> 01:18.712
I'll get you some help.

01:18.746 --> 01:20.881
You ought to see if there's
a suicide counselor there

01:20.914 --> 01:22.183
while we're waiting, too.

01:23.184 --> 01:24.785
Miss,

01:24.818 --> 01:26.787
we've been a couple hours here;
is there anything you can do

01:26.820 --> 01:28.856
to try to,

01:28.889 --> 01:29.823
you know, push things along?

01:29.857 --> 01:31.125
Thank you.

01:31.159 --> 01:34.094
Ramirez? Lydia Ramirez?

01:39.867 --> 01:41.135
How's it going, sport?

01:41.169 --> 01:42.870
Uh, it's just, uh...
(clears throat)

01:42.903 --> 01:45.506
settled a friendly
bet the hard way.

01:45.539 --> 01:46.740
Mm-hmm.

01:46.774 --> 01:48.342
I'm a detective; anything
I can help you with?

01:48.376 --> 01:50.878
Oh, no harm, no foul.
Mm-hmm.

01:50.911 --> 01:52.380
I'd sure like to see
the other guy.

01:52.413 --> 01:54.748
Well, he looks better than me.

01:54.782 --> 01:55.849
What's your name?

01:55.883 --> 01:57.818
Uh, Phil Gibson.
Uh, bloody hand.

01:57.851 --> 02:00.388
Well, despite what the
sign says out front,

02:00.421 --> 02:02.156
if you came here
'cause of an emergency,

02:02.190 --> 02:03.224
you're in the wrong place.

02:03.257 --> 02:05.726
Uh, no biggie; I just
want to get my nose looked at.

02:05.759 --> 02:07.561
Well, good luck with that.

02:07.595 --> 02:09.730
We'll just be sitting

02:09.763 --> 02:12.166
right over here, okay?

02:14.935 --> 02:16.604
Thank you.
My partner takes two sweeteners.

02:16.637 --> 02:17.771
You got?
Sure.

02:17.805 --> 02:18.906
How much do I owe you?

02:18.939 --> 02:20.774
Oh, no, on me, please.

02:20.808 --> 02:22.743
No, no, no, I can't do that.

02:22.776 --> 02:23.911
I'm new on this block.

02:23.944 --> 02:24.845
Better you tell
your fellow officers

02:24.878 --> 02:26.947
that this is the best
coffee in town, yes?

02:26.980 --> 02:28.949
If it is, I will,
but I'm still paying for it.

02:28.982 --> 02:29.850
This is for you.

02:29.883 --> 02:31.919
Whoa.
(chuckles)

02:31.952 --> 02:33.621
Thank you, Officer.

02:33.654 --> 02:34.822
Officer Reagan?

02:34.855 --> 02:36.357
Detective Jones.

02:36.390 --> 02:37.891
Please follow us
back to your command.

02:37.925 --> 02:39.393
Why? What's this all about?

02:39.427 --> 02:41.495
We have orders
to pull you in forthwith.

02:41.529 --> 02:43.631
How come they didn't
just 10-2 me then?
Because clearly,

02:43.664 --> 02:45.866
they didn't want the order
going out over the radio.

02:45.899 --> 02:47.901
Right now please.

02:52.806 --> 02:54.808
Curatola, Jacqueline.

02:54.842 --> 02:56.610
All right,
here we go.

02:56.644 --> 02:58.312
You'll feel better
in a few minutes.

02:58.346 --> 03:00.448
Right. They're just
gonna give me Tums.

03:00.481 --> 03:02.516
You want I should come
hold your hand?

03:02.550 --> 03:03.651
You should.

03:03.684 --> 03:04.752
(muttering)
Hey!

03:04.785 --> 03:06.720
WOMAN:
Help! Help!

03:06.754 --> 03:08.589
Help!

03:08.622 --> 03:10.924
Hey, you all right, man?
(choking)

03:10.958 --> 03:12.926
Hey, we need a doctor!

03:12.960 --> 03:14.262
Get back.

03:14.295 --> 03:15.763
Are you with him?
No, no.

03:15.796 --> 03:16.897
Did he tell you anything?

03:16.930 --> 03:18.832
He said something about
having a fight, but he was fine.

03:18.866 --> 03:19.933
Sir, can you hear me?

03:35.483 --> 03:36.950
Thank you, Detective.

03:40.788 --> 03:42.323
This can't be good.

03:42.356 --> 03:46.427
O.C.C.B. is picking up chatter
that Philip Sanfino's crew

03:46.460 --> 03:48.596
has orders to put a hit on you.

03:49.997 --> 03:51.899
Me or Jimmy Riordan?

03:51.932 --> 03:53.334
Jimmy Riordan.

03:53.367 --> 03:55.436
Apparently,
after we staged your arrest,

03:55.469 --> 03:57.338
they sent a lawyer down.

03:57.371 --> 03:59.873
And there was no client
for them to represent.

03:59.907 --> 04:02.776
No, we just missed it.

04:02.810 --> 04:06.680
We just never anticipated they'd
send someone to represent you.

04:06.714 --> 04:08.716
Do they know I'm a cop?

04:10.050 --> 04:11.285
We don't think so.

04:11.319 --> 04:14.722
But it's probably worse if it's
someone cooperating with a cop.

04:14.755 --> 04:17.057
So, what do we do?

04:17.090 --> 04:19.460
You sit this one out
until we're certain

04:19.493 --> 04:21.629
there's no longer a price
on your head.

04:54.662 --> 04:56.330
CRAIG:
He died from unrelieved swelling

04:56.364 --> 04:58.999
of the brain caused
by a severe concussion

04:59.032 --> 05:00.434
and the resulting
frontal lobe hematoma.

05:00.468 --> 05:02.703
Right, when I spoke
to him right before he died,

05:02.736 --> 05:04.538
he gave me the impression
he was in some kind of fight.

05:04.572 --> 05:06.607
The abrasions and contusions
would point to that,

05:06.640 --> 05:07.975
except for one thing.

05:08.008 --> 05:10.010
The hands.
Exactly.

05:10.043 --> 05:11.812
Looks more like
he got a manicure

05:11.845 --> 05:13.914
than had a beef.

05:22.122 --> 05:24.525
So, what is this,
I'm grounded?
We got everybody

05:24.558 --> 05:27.094
up on the O.C. wires trying
to find out more details,

05:27.127 --> 05:30.764
but for right now, yes,
you are confined to this house.

05:30.798 --> 05:31.932
For how long?

05:31.965 --> 05:33.701
As long as it takes.

05:33.734 --> 05:34.768
Do I have a curfew?

05:34.802 --> 05:35.903
Can I stay up and
watch Jon Stewart?

05:35.936 --> 05:37.905
You think this is funny?

05:37.938 --> 05:39.707
No, I think it's ridiculous;
you wouldn't do this

05:39.740 --> 05:41.409
to any other cop caught
in the same situation.

05:41.442 --> 05:42.743
I damn sure would.

05:42.776 --> 05:45.913
I just wouldn't have
them move in with me.

05:45.946 --> 05:48.782
There's got to be something
I can do besides just sit here.

05:48.816 --> 05:51.018
Well, my dining room chair's
a little wobbly.

05:51.051 --> 05:52.953
I have some Gorilla Glue
in the garage.

05:52.986 --> 05:55.088
I'll see you tonight.

05:56.724 --> 06:00.060
You'd think it was him
they put a hit out on.

06:00.093 --> 06:02.129
Take your worst fear,

06:02.162 --> 06:04.998
multiply it by 100,

06:05.032 --> 06:06.199
you're not even in the ballpark.

06:06.233 --> 06:09.002
You're not even in the parking
lot next to the ballpark.

06:10.571 --> 06:12.406
Thanks. Big help.

06:12.440 --> 06:15.576
Look, you have to understand
the way your father thinks.

06:15.609 --> 06:18.446
He's got such a deep sense
of responsibility

06:18.479 --> 06:20.914
that when something goes wrong,
he takes it personally.

06:20.948 --> 06:23.884
And his job is
to put 30-odd thousand people

06:23.917 --> 06:25.118
in harm's way every day.

06:25.152 --> 06:26.654
Try juggling that.

06:26.687 --> 06:27.888
Okay, well,
sometimes around here,

06:27.921 --> 06:30.758
it's like Danny's made of armor,
and I'm made of toothpicks.

06:30.791 --> 06:32.059
Come on,

06:32.092 --> 06:34.495
he's an equal opportunity
worrywart.

06:34.528 --> 06:36.897
How am I supposed to walk around
with that on my shoulders?

06:36.930 --> 06:39.032
That's for you to figure out.

06:39.066 --> 06:40.868
He's not gonna change.

06:42.836 --> 06:45.873
You clear, I'll clean.

06:50.844 --> 06:52.813
MAN:
He was our colleague,

06:52.846 --> 06:56.517
he was our friend,
but most of all,

06:56.550 --> 06:57.985
he was our brother in arms,

06:58.018 --> 06:59.953
and, um,

06:59.987 --> 07:02.956
suddenly he's gone.

07:02.990 --> 07:06.059
And, uh,

07:06.093 --> 07:08.496
it sucks.

07:08.529 --> 07:11.632
But the way to get through
this is to honor Phil

07:11.665 --> 07:14.001
in all we do,

07:14.034 --> 07:16.169
in all we achieve.

07:17.705 --> 07:20.641
In the memory of one of our own
who is now behind the sun.

07:20.674 --> 07:22.543
Come on, let's hear it for Phil

07:29.983 --> 07:31.885
Excuse me, you
ladies did tell them

07:31.919 --> 07:34.154
that I was a detective
with the NYPD, right?

07:34.187 --> 07:35.255
They're almost finished.

07:35.288 --> 07:37.057
Okay.

07:37.090 --> 07:38.792
You know Phil?

07:38.826 --> 07:40.027
Yes, of course.

07:40.060 --> 07:42.663
Did you know if anyone
had a beef with him?

07:42.696 --> 07:43.764
A beef?

07:43.797 --> 07:46.099
Like some street-y thing?

07:46.133 --> 07:48.536
Like a problem?

07:48.569 --> 07:51.004
Can't think of anyone
who'd want to hurt him.

07:51.038 --> 07:53.106
Mm-hmm. You?

07:53.140 --> 07:54.474
Not here anyway.

07:57.210 --> 08:00.681
Hi, Detective, I'm sorry
to keep you waiting.

08:00.714 --> 08:02.916
I'm Josh Thorp; this
is Terry Longacre.

08:02.950 --> 08:04.552
Um, should we take
it to our office?

08:04.585 --> 08:05.753
Sure.

08:05.786 --> 08:07.788
No calls.

08:09.089 --> 08:12.192
He ever show up to work
like that before?

08:12.225 --> 08:13.561
All beat up?

08:13.594 --> 08:14.895
Only from a hangover.

08:14.928 --> 08:17.197
Wait, wait, wait,
what was his line again?

08:17.230 --> 08:20.167
Oh, uh, "I don't call it
a hangover anymore.

08:20.200 --> 08:21.635
It's just the morning."

08:21.669 --> 08:22.703
So, he had a drinking problem?

08:22.736 --> 08:25.105
Not that ever got
in the way of his productivity.

08:25.138 --> 08:26.707
I don't know
what you mean by that.

08:26.740 --> 08:27.908
Look, Detective,

08:27.941 --> 08:29.577
if you took all the
functioning alcoholics

08:29.610 --> 08:31.311
out of the
financial industry,

08:31.344 --> 08:33.847
you'd be left with, like,
two bond analysts and a ATM.

08:33.881 --> 08:34.982
So, sure he drank.

08:35.015 --> 08:36.917
How about gambling?
Any gambling problems?

08:36.950 --> 08:38.886
We're all gamblers.

08:38.919 --> 08:40.120
I mean,
serious gambling problems,

08:40.153 --> 08:41.855
like he was into his bookie?

08:41.889 --> 08:43.724
I mean,
there is a version of this story

08:43.757 --> 08:44.992
where he caught
a real beat down.

08:45.025 --> 08:46.860
Not that I ever heard of.

08:46.894 --> 08:49.162
I mean, Philip played division
three hockey and lacrosse.

08:49.196 --> 08:51.031
I mean, he knew his way
around a fight.

08:51.064 --> 08:52.900
He have friends in the company?

08:52.933 --> 08:54.267
People he hung out with
after work?

08:54.301 --> 08:56.036
Uh, Larry, Brad, Jason.

08:56.069 --> 08:57.270
Kenny, Rand.

08:57.304 --> 08:58.972
I mean, guys he went
to school with.

08:59.006 --> 09:01.108
I'll have Sara give you
their contacts on your way out.

09:01.141 --> 09:02.910
Great.

09:02.943 --> 09:04.878
Just out of curiosity,

09:04.912 --> 09:06.279
what do you think
happened to him?

09:06.313 --> 09:08.315
Well, same as you do, Detective,

09:08.348 --> 09:10.183
uh, he got
into some sort of fight

09:10.217 --> 09:12.920
and, uh, suffered an injury
the proved to be fatal.

09:12.953 --> 09:15.923
I mean, it's a real tragedy

09:15.956 --> 09:16.924
for all of us.

09:16.957 --> 09:18.358
Mm-hmm. And you?

09:18.391 --> 09:19.927
Yeah, ditto.

09:19.960 --> 09:21.128
And we're gonna do
everything we can

09:21.161 --> 09:23.030
to get to the bottom
of it as well.

09:23.063 --> 09:24.131
What does that mean?

09:24.164 --> 09:25.332
It means that
we're gonna have

09:25.365 --> 09:27.067
our security team
look into it.

09:27.100 --> 09:28.268
Your security team?

09:28.301 --> 09:29.703
Yeah.
Oh.

09:29.737 --> 09:30.904
With all due respect,

09:30.938 --> 09:33.006
I'm not gonna trust
my financial assets

09:33.040 --> 09:34.742
to the New York
City Comptroller.

09:34.775 --> 09:37.945
I'm not gonna trust a human
asset to city services, either.

09:37.978 --> 09:39.747
I'm not city services.

09:39.780 --> 09:41.048
I'm a first grade detective

09:41.081 --> 09:42.349
with the New York City
Police Department.

09:42.382 --> 09:44.818
And I will not hesitate
for one second to lock up

09:44.852 --> 09:46.153
anybody who interferes
with my investigation.

09:46.186 --> 09:47.154
You understand?

09:47.187 --> 09:49.723
Forgive my partner,
Detective.

09:49.757 --> 09:53.026
Um, just in shock around here
this morning.

09:55.028 --> 09:56.797
Very well.

09:56.830 --> 09:57.931
They'll give me that list?

09:57.965 --> 09:59.900
Yeah.

10:02.269 --> 10:04.772
I can, uh, give them all
a heads up, if you like?

10:04.805 --> 10:07.741
No, I wouldn't want you to spoil
the element of surprise.

10:07.775 --> 10:09.176
They are his friends.

10:09.209 --> 10:10.711
Yeah, well, you know,

10:10.744 --> 10:13.046
even friends have stuff
to hide sometimes.

10:13.080 --> 10:16.083
Um, did any of these guys
not show up for work today?

10:17.818 --> 10:19.419
Simple question.

10:19.452 --> 10:21.755
Rand Hilbert.

10:21.789 --> 10:24.124
(elevator dings)
But he was scheduled to
fly for a meeting in Boston

10:24.157 --> 10:25.192
on the first shuttle.

10:25.225 --> 10:27.127
Okay, good to know.

10:27.160 --> 10:29.162
Thanks for your help.

10:32.165 --> 10:34.067
All right, thanks.

10:34.101 --> 10:35.903
What do you got?
Rand Hilbert was booked

10:35.936 --> 10:37.871
on a 6:00 a.m. shuttle to Boston

10:37.905 --> 10:39.707
but was refused boarding
because of his quote,

10:39.740 --> 10:41.374
"inebriated
and agitated state."

10:41.408 --> 10:42.810
Then he's home?
No.

10:42.843 --> 10:44.177
The night doorman says
he got in a town car

10:44.211 --> 10:46.146
at 4:30 to the airport;
the day doorman says

10:46.179 --> 10:47.247
he never returned home.

10:47.280 --> 10:48.916
And the doormen
have your number?

10:48.949 --> 10:50.117
Yeah, and they get
50 bucks to use it.

10:50.150 --> 10:52.753
Show these guys a 20, they look
at it like it's a nickel.

10:52.786 --> 10:54.822
Right, now even the doormen
are players.

10:58.458 --> 11:00.861
All right,
then what the hell is this?

11:00.894 --> 11:01.862
What?

11:01.895 --> 11:04.131
I got an e-mail

11:04.164 --> 11:06.834
from Philip.Gibson
@CortlandtStreetCapital.com.

11:06.867 --> 11:08.201
A dead guy sent you an e-mail?

11:08.235 --> 11:09.737
Apparently, he did.

11:09.770 --> 11:12.005
596 West 2-8, 9:00 p.m.

11:12.039 --> 11:14.174
Bring a $100 bill
with the word "damaged"

11:14.207 --> 11:16.309
written on it--
that's your ticket.

11:17.811 --> 11:19.146
Got a couple $100 bills on you?

11:19.179 --> 11:20.080
Uh, no, but there's a bank

11:20.113 --> 11:21.949
across the street
that's open till 5:00.

11:21.982 --> 11:23.083
Great.

11:23.116 --> 11:25.018
Let's make a withdrawal.

11:35.395 --> 11:37.030
Thanks.

11:38.866 --> 11:40.200
ARBOGAST:
I can't say as this

11:40.233 --> 11:41.468
is good news or bad,

11:41.501 --> 11:43.470
but we picked up further
intel on the hit.

11:43.503 --> 11:45.072
It's now hits-- plural.

11:45.105 --> 11:48.141
Phil Sanfino got orders to
take out his nephew, Noble.

11:49.409 --> 11:51.211
What for?

11:51.244 --> 11:52.445
What for?
For bringing you in,

11:52.479 --> 11:54.782
or rather,
bringing Jimmy Riordan in.

11:54.815 --> 11:56.149
Have they carried it out?

11:56.183 --> 11:58.118
Not that we know of.

11:58.151 --> 12:01.421
So we can still reach out
to him, right?

12:01.454 --> 12:03.323
To who?

12:03.356 --> 12:04.858
Noble.

12:04.892 --> 12:06.459
That's a pretty fragile
ecosystem.

12:06.493 --> 12:08.428
Uh, you know,
we got a lot at stake.

12:08.461 --> 12:10.097
We can't compromise
the whole operation

12:10.130 --> 12:11.965
for one wiseguy.

12:11.999 --> 12:14.935
So, what... what,
Noble's just roadkill in this?

12:14.968 --> 12:19.039
Jamie, we're not talking
about innocent bystanders here.

12:19.072 --> 12:21.308
We're talking about the NYPD
handing down a death penalty.

12:22.910 --> 12:24.011
Collateral damage.

12:24.044 --> 12:25.412
On the side of
the patrol car

12:25.445 --> 12:26.479
that I drive,

12:26.513 --> 12:28.381
it says "courtesy,
professionalism and respect,"

12:28.415 --> 12:29.983
not "judge, jury
and executioner."

12:30.017 --> 12:30.984
That's out of line.

12:31.018 --> 12:32.986
We cannot risk

12:33.020 --> 12:35.155
letting Noble Sanfino know.

12:35.188 --> 12:37.557
We're 36 hours out
from taking down the case.

12:37.590 --> 12:39.392
I can't see how tipping
any of them

12:39.426 --> 12:41.895
that we've got eyes and ears
isn't asking for trouble.

12:44.464 --> 12:46.199
Unless you want to order it.

12:46.233 --> 12:48.168
I won't do that.

12:48.201 --> 12:50.103
And why can't we
move it up to tomorrow?

12:50.137 --> 12:51.538
What are we waiting for, Vic?

12:51.571 --> 12:54.041
Cavazzere's grandkid's
christening.

12:54.074 --> 12:57.077
We're expecting a few of them
to come out of hiding to attend.

13:00.881 --> 13:04.051
Let's just agree this
isn't everyone's finest hour.

13:20.633 --> 13:23.170
(low chatter)

13:23.203 --> 13:25.072
Girl, look, I got one, too.

13:25.105 --> 13:28.008
See? He's already
seen my I.D.

13:29.877 --> 13:30.610
Reagan.

13:30.643 --> 13:32.245
Danny Reagan.
Gary Heller.

13:32.279 --> 13:34.247
Looking good.
Stepping out?

13:34.281 --> 13:35.382
Actually, I'm on the job.

13:35.415 --> 13:36.316
Do you mind?

13:36.349 --> 13:38.118
This is my partner,
Detective Curatola.

13:38.151 --> 13:40.420
Oh... New York's finest.

13:40.453 --> 13:41.588
Would you knock it off?

13:41.621 --> 13:43.056
What are you doing
here anyway?

13:43.090 --> 13:45.993
Working the, uh,
roofie concession here?

13:46.026 --> 13:47.194
You know, Heller
worked, uh,

13:47.227 --> 13:48.929
narcotics in the
2-1 for years.

13:48.962 --> 13:50.197
Mmm.
Jamaicans were running

13:50.230 --> 13:51.364
millions of dollars
through the streets.

13:51.398 --> 13:54.101
But they never lost an ounce
on your watch, did they, Gary?

13:54.134 --> 13:55.168
That's right. Yeah.

13:55.202 --> 13:56.503
See you around, Regan.

13:56.536 --> 13:59.873
Yeah, not if I see you first.

13:59.907 --> 14:01.274
Flopped cop?

14:01.308 --> 14:04.344
He flipped on some Jamaicans
in exchange for immunity.

14:04.377 --> 14:06.279
Guy never met an
angle he didn't like.

14:06.313 --> 14:08.015
(sighs) You know what?

14:08.048 --> 14:09.316
I'm seeing a lot
of these bracelets.

14:09.349 --> 14:10.650
I'm not seeing any bills.

14:10.683 --> 14:12.085
You think we got duped?

14:12.119 --> 14:13.186
I don't know.

14:13.220 --> 14:14.521
Yes?

14:14.554 --> 14:16.356
Not sure how this works.

14:16.389 --> 14:18.658
Damaged?

14:18.691 --> 14:21.161
All right.

14:21.194 --> 14:23.296
Go ahead.

14:32.072 --> 14:33.240
Thank you.

14:46.019 --> 14:47.520
Excuse us.

14:47.554 --> 14:49.456
Thank you.

14:53.393 --> 14:55.462
(hard rock music blaring)

15:11.211 --> 15:13.213
(cheering)

15:15.082 --> 15:16.283
Boxing gloves.

15:16.316 --> 15:18.318
That explains
the clean hands he had.

15:26.059 --> 15:28.361
It's like cockfighting
for rich guys.

15:34.301 --> 15:36.036
I'm going to go
look around.

15:36.069 --> 15:37.070
I'll be back.

15:37.104 --> 15:39.239
Excuse me. Excuse me.

15:39.272 --> 15:41.308
Excuse me.

15:43.210 --> 15:45.245
Excuse me.

15:45.278 --> 15:47.514
There it is, man.
Get in there.

15:47.547 --> 15:49.416
Watch the left!

15:49.449 --> 15:50.683
Who do you got?

15:50.717 --> 15:53.120
Nexmont. You?

15:53.153 --> 15:54.354
Nexmont.

15:54.387 --> 15:55.455
How big?

15:55.488 --> 15:56.990
Oh, big.

15:57.024 --> 15:58.525
How about you?

15:58.558 --> 16:00.560
50K big.

16:00.593 --> 16:01.628
Hit him!

16:09.169 --> 16:11.238
(cheering and applause)

16:15.808 --> 16:18.145
You guys here last night?

16:18.178 --> 16:19.279
Yeah. You?

16:19.312 --> 16:22.049
Did you see the fight with
the Cortlandt Street guy?

16:22.082 --> 16:24.284
Yeah. He ended up
in the hospital.

16:24.317 --> 16:26.519
Not surprised. He was getting
really clocked out there.

16:26.553 --> 16:28.155
Uh-huh.

16:28.188 --> 16:29.389
Who was the guy he fought?

16:29.422 --> 16:32.425
It was another
Cortlandt Street guy.

16:32.459 --> 16:33.760
They're the only firm
that will pit

16:33.793 --> 16:35.428
two of their own
against each other.

16:35.462 --> 16:38.065
Guy gave up like 20 pounds
and six inches of reach,

16:38.098 --> 16:40.133
but it was like
he had a hammer.

16:40.167 --> 16:41.501
Yeah, what was his
name, that guy?

16:42.769 --> 16:44.771
Cortlandt Street,
they're all Ivy guys.

16:44.804 --> 16:46.439
I don't know anybody
down there.

16:50.443 --> 16:51.778
Ooh.

16:51.811 --> 16:53.480
They got no bell here?

16:53.513 --> 16:54.381
Bells are for cats.

16:54.414 --> 16:55.548
Is this your first time?

16:55.582 --> 16:56.749
(cell phone ringing)

16:56.783 --> 16:58.351
Yeah, just checking it out.

16:58.385 --> 16:59.452
Where you work?

16:59.486 --> 17:00.620
One second.

17:00.653 --> 17:02.155
Reagan.

17:02.189 --> 17:03.756
You did?

17:03.790 --> 17:06.226
Yeah, okay.

17:06.259 --> 17:08.361
I'm on my way.

17:10.163 --> 17:11.364
Um, I work here,

17:11.398 --> 17:14.367
with the NYPD.

17:14.401 --> 17:16.035
Your cards?

17:23.210 --> 17:25.345
Good luck.

17:25.378 --> 17:27.280
Excuse me.

17:27.314 --> 17:30.150
Rand Hilbert
came back home, Jack.

17:30.183 --> 17:31.518
We should head over.

17:31.551 --> 17:33.120
Yeah.

17:33.153 --> 17:34.554
It's time for his
post-fight interview.

17:40.493 --> 17:42.295
Wow. Cortlandt Street
company cars.

17:42.329 --> 17:44.231
Looks like they started
the party without us.

17:44.264 --> 17:46.199
Yeah.

17:50.203 --> 17:51.371
Hey. When did he get back?

17:51.404 --> 17:52.572
Minute before
I called you.

17:52.605 --> 17:53.806
Yeah? And how about
his visitors?

17:53.840 --> 17:55.442
Uh, ten minutes
after that.

17:55.475 --> 17:56.509
Apartment?

17:56.543 --> 17:57.410
11-B.

17:57.444 --> 17:58.711
We go up unannounced.

17:58.745 --> 18:00.480
You got it?

18:01.881 --> 18:04.083
(men's voices in distance)

18:05.685 --> 18:07.654
You hear that?
Mm-hmm.

18:07.687 --> 18:09.689
(man yelling)

18:10.857 --> 18:12.492
(knocking)

18:12.525 --> 18:14.427
Police. Open up.

18:16.863 --> 18:18.365
Let's go.

18:18.398 --> 18:19.666
Coming in!

18:20.800 --> 18:22.269
Mr. Hilbert?

18:22.302 --> 18:23.503
That's my father's name.

18:23.536 --> 18:25.505
Would you put the bottle
down, please, sir?

18:26.539 --> 18:28.441
I said put the bottle down now.

18:31.378 --> 18:32.579
Cutting myself off.
Hey, easy, easy.

18:32.612 --> 18:34.514
Sit down
and don't move.

18:34.547 --> 18:36.449
My partner and I
just come from Damaged.

18:36.483 --> 18:38.151
Who wants to go first?

18:39.852 --> 18:41.554
Okay, then.

18:41.588 --> 18:43.456
The first rule
of fight club is:

18:43.490 --> 18:45.925
you will talk
about fight club now.

18:45.958 --> 18:47.627
Detective, I'm Jack Quayle.
I know who you are.

18:47.660 --> 18:48.628
Who's lawyered up?

18:48.661 --> 18:49.729
I'm on retainer with the firm.

18:49.762 --> 18:50.563
Oh, lucky for them.

18:50.597 --> 18:52.165
Were you at the
fight last night?

18:52.199 --> 18:53.500
(laughs)
Of course not.

18:53.533 --> 18:54.767
Then get at the back
of the line.

18:54.801 --> 18:57.470
None of us
were there.
Rand was there.

18:57.504 --> 18:58.171
Weren't you, Rand?

18:58.205 --> 18:59.172
You don't have to answer that.

18:59.972 --> 19:01.441
You really want
to waste my time

19:01.474 --> 19:03.210
making me go round up
witnesses, huh?

19:03.243 --> 19:05.645
Go ahead. Go ahead.

19:05.678 --> 19:07.447
Were you there or not, Rand?

19:09.316 --> 19:11.784
Yeah. Yep.

19:11.818 --> 19:13.620
And you were in the ring
with Mr. Gibson, weren't you?

19:13.653 --> 19:15.722
Yeah.

19:15.755 --> 19:18.291
Yeah, and you hit
Mr. Gibson, who later died.

19:18.325 --> 19:19.926
Is that not true?
QUAYLE:
Detective, you talked

19:19.959 --> 19:21.661
to Mr. Gibson
before he passed away.

19:21.694 --> 19:23.396
And you know that how?

19:23.430 --> 19:25.465
LONGACRE:
As I told you,

19:25.498 --> 19:27.767
we're trying to get
to the bottom of this ourselves.

19:27.800 --> 19:30.237
The point is, did he
say anything to you

19:30.270 --> 19:32.439
about being forced
into the ring?

19:32.472 --> 19:34.641
The point is,
we're asking the questions.

19:34.674 --> 19:36.276
Whatever you say.

19:36.309 --> 19:38.311
I had words with him.

19:38.345 --> 19:39.679
Wasn't an interview.

19:39.712 --> 19:41.248
But you identified yourself
as NYPD,

19:41.281 --> 19:42.882
so, surely,
if there was some foul play,

19:42.915 --> 19:44.217
he would have said something.

19:44.251 --> 19:45.084
Not necessarily.

19:45.117 --> 19:47.287
Is there a bathroom
here I can use?

19:47.320 --> 19:49.256
Yeah, right through there.

19:55.027 --> 19:57.330
Were you close, you and Phil?

19:57.364 --> 19:58.865
(sighs)

19:58.898 --> 20:00.967
We were brothers, man.

20:01.000 --> 20:02.269
They went to prep school
and college together.

20:02.302 --> 20:03.236
They were best friends.

20:03.270 --> 20:04.971
And as you can see,
Rand here is crushed.

20:05.004 --> 20:07.940
No, as I can see,
Rand here is a train wreck,

20:07.974 --> 20:09.276
and you guys
are all up here

20:09.309 --> 20:10.277
trying to get
your stories straight.

20:10.310 --> 20:11.077
(stifled retching)

20:11.110 --> 20:11.878
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, no.

20:11.911 --> 20:13.280
That's the ladies' room
right now.

20:13.313 --> 20:14.881
Use the sink.

20:16.283 --> 20:18.551
Counselor, I need to interview
him as soon as possible,

20:18.585 --> 20:20.720
so why don't you get him
straightened out, all right?

20:20.753 --> 20:22.855
I will have Mr. Hilbert
ready at 8:00 a.m.

20:22.889 --> 20:24.991
for an interview with you
and the ADA of your choice.

20:25.024 --> 20:26.293
Oh, you'll do that?
Mm-hmm.

20:26.326 --> 20:27.960
And you two,

20:27.994 --> 20:30.297
you knew about this
when we met this morning,

20:30.330 --> 20:32.565
and instead, you choose
to yank my chain instead?

20:32.599 --> 20:33.500
That's not true.

20:33.533 --> 20:34.634
We're piecing this together
just as you are.

20:34.667 --> 20:37.904
We apologize if you got
the wrong impression, Detective.

20:37.937 --> 20:39.606
Your money doesn't
make me stupid, all right?

20:39.639 --> 20:42.275
And Mr. Quayle doesn't
make me shrink, either.

20:42.309 --> 20:43.743
Yeah, and that fact,
if it is one,

20:43.776 --> 20:45.312
doesn't make you right.
Shut up, Terry.

20:46.313 --> 20:47.480
Take it easy.

20:47.514 --> 20:49.349
Let's go, partner.

20:50.317 --> 20:52.752
We'll see you bright
and early, Mr. Hilbert.

20:52.785 --> 20:55.588
Try some tomato juice.

20:57.690 --> 20:58.925
You find anything
in the bathroom?

20:58.958 --> 21:00.393
Yeah, there
were meds for him

21:00.427 --> 21:02.061
like a Marine coming back
from a third tour.

21:02.094 --> 21:04.464
It's a bottle of alprazolam
prescribed to a girl.

21:04.497 --> 21:06.299
Recent prescription.

21:06.333 --> 21:07.500
Okay, what's alprazolam?

21:07.534 --> 21:08.968
It's a generic for Zanny.

21:09.001 --> 21:10.703
All right, and the
girl-- what's her name?

21:10.737 --> 21:12.038
Sara Allen, Chelsea address.

21:12.071 --> 21:14.307
Sara Allen is the name

21:14.341 --> 21:17.510
of one of the assistants at
Cortlandt Street Capital.

21:34.961 --> 21:37.564
That bottle full
when you cracked it?

21:37.597 --> 21:39.832
Sir, yes, sir.

21:39.866 --> 21:42.369
Stop at the halfway mark.

21:43.836 --> 21:46.706
Wasn't doing
a damn thing anyway.

21:46.739 --> 21:48.408
(sighs)

21:48.441 --> 21:50.643
It isn't missionary work we do.

21:51.678 --> 21:53.880
Yep.

21:53.913 --> 21:56.649
You want me to go?
Just say so.

21:59.386 --> 22:01.821
What would you do in my shoes?

22:01.854 --> 22:06.826
Drink the neck and shoulders
off a bottle for starters.

22:06.859 --> 22:08.461
Then?

22:08.495 --> 22:11.531
You can't just go out
and find him.

22:11.564 --> 22:15.001
His family has a hit out on
a guy who looks just like you,

22:15.034 --> 22:17.504
and they're not gonna stop
and ask for I.D.

22:17.537 --> 22:19.406
I know that.

22:19.439 --> 22:21.741
And you can't tell him
you're a cop.

22:21.774 --> 22:23.476
That would scratch
a pending bust

22:23.510 --> 22:25.945
that's taken up thousands
of man hours

22:25.978 --> 22:27.480
and should and must go down.

22:27.514 --> 22:29.716
So what do I do?

22:29.749 --> 22:31.150
I don't want to screw this up,

22:31.183 --> 22:33.820
but I can't just stand by
knowing what I know.

22:35.422 --> 22:38.024
Neither would you.

22:44.130 --> 22:47.700
Don't tell the Commissioner
I said this...

22:49.536 --> 22:52.004
that you want to make a move,

22:52.038 --> 22:54.507
you keep those boundaries in
sight at all times.

22:55.775 --> 22:57.777
Not a lot of room there.

22:57.810 --> 23:02.415
A smart cop can find room
between a rock and a hard place.

23:02.449 --> 23:05.418
Good night, son.

23:05.452 --> 23:06.719
Good night.

23:18.097 --> 23:20.199
Noble. You know what to do.

23:20.232 --> 23:22.134
It's Jimmy.
You need to call me

23:22.168 --> 23:24.403
as soon as you get this.

23:43.723 --> 23:45.191
Sara the receptionist.

23:45.224 --> 23:47.594
Did you give Rand Hilbert
your Zannies

23:47.627 --> 23:49.829
or did you just leave 'em
at his apartment?

23:49.862 --> 23:52.064
Neither.

23:52.098 --> 23:54.467
Really? You know, I could
screw your weekend up

23:54.501 --> 23:55.735
pretty easy if I
wanted to, Sara.

23:55.768 --> 23:57.036
I dated Philip a little.

23:57.069 --> 23:59.639
And Rand must
have lifted 'em.

23:59.672 --> 24:02.509
Those two practically lived
at each other's apartments.

24:02.542 --> 24:04.210
You and Philip Gibson,
you were close?

24:04.243 --> 24:06.145
Not very.

24:06.178 --> 24:08.681
You can't be,
with a guy like that.

24:08.715 --> 24:09.849
Why not?

24:09.882 --> 24:11.751
They're little boys.
Oh.

24:11.784 --> 24:15.021
They're a lot of fun,
but you can't trust them

24:15.054 --> 24:16.989
with anything breakable.

24:17.023 --> 24:18.758
But I, uh, I cared about him.

24:18.791 --> 24:20.192
You did care
about him.

24:20.226 --> 24:22.194
Is that why you sent me
the e-mail?

24:22.228 --> 24:25.197
I, I don't know
what you're talking about.

24:25.231 --> 24:27.700
Sure, you do. You wanted to
clear up how he was killed

24:27.734 --> 24:29.135
so he could rest in peace.

24:29.168 --> 24:31.237
Or so maybe you could
have a little peace, hmm?

24:31.270 --> 24:36.042
Were Rand and Philip
forced to fight?

24:36.075 --> 24:38.678
You mean, like, with a gun
to their heads?

24:38.711 --> 24:41.013
No. It's a lot
more subtle than that.

24:41.047 --> 24:42.248
What do you mean?

24:42.281 --> 24:46.118
It's like at college when they
were pledging fraternities.

24:46.152 --> 24:48.788
They didn't have to endure
all that humiliation,

24:48.821 --> 24:51.223
but they weren't getting in
the frat if they didn't.

24:51.257 --> 24:54.994
But no, no one was forced.

24:55.027 --> 24:57.564
What about Longacre and Thorp?

24:57.597 --> 24:58.965
They bet on the fight?

24:58.998 --> 25:01.133
I can't say for sure,

25:01.167 --> 25:03.235
but Longacre and Thorp will
literally bet six figures on

25:03.269 --> 25:05.004
which bird flies
off the wire next.

25:05.037 --> 25:07.139
Work with me here, Sara.

25:07.173 --> 25:09.709
Look, I get paid 50 K for my
skills and another 50

25:09.742 --> 25:11.210
to look good
and keep my mouth shut.

25:11.243 --> 25:14.046
I've already said too much.

25:14.080 --> 25:16.783
It was an accident,

25:16.816 --> 25:22.722
tragic and sad, but an accident.

25:22.755 --> 25:25.892
And I have a wake to go to.

25:25.925 --> 25:28.160
All right, go on.

25:38.237 --> 25:41.741
I do hear you, Detective,
but right now all I'm hearing is

25:41.774 --> 25:44.010
that Mr. Hilbert and Mr. Gibson
stepped

25:44.043 --> 25:45.277
into that ring voluntarily

25:45.311 --> 25:47.980
to more or less audition
for the next Jackass movie.

25:48.014 --> 25:49.982
It was stupid and tragic,

25:50.016 --> 25:53.586
but there is no evidence that
Mr. Hilbert committed a crime.

25:53.620 --> 25:54.621
Right.

25:54.654 --> 25:56.923
What? So I'm free? Is that...?

25:56.956 --> 25:59.759
My office is not charging you
with anything at this moment.

25:59.792 --> 26:01.193
Thank you, Ms. Reagan.

26:01.227 --> 26:02.361
No need for gratitude,
Mr. Quayle,

26:02.394 --> 26:04.931
but I would appreciate it
if your client was available

26:04.964 --> 26:06.833
to the detectives should they
need any further assistance

26:06.866 --> 26:07.900
with the investigation.

26:07.934 --> 26:09.135
I'll be at home.

26:09.168 --> 26:10.269
I won't move unless
you ask me to.

26:10.302 --> 26:12.639
Your friend

26:12.672 --> 26:14.173
Gibby...

26:14.206 --> 26:15.642
you know, he had
a reach advantage

26:15.675 --> 26:17.343
and about a good 20 pounds
on you.

26:17.376 --> 26:19.812
I sure would love to see
the gloves you had on.

26:19.846 --> 26:22.081
They're in my gym bag in
the closet by the door.

26:22.114 --> 26:23.650
Oh. So you're giving me
permission

26:23.683 --> 26:25.317
to send my partner
to retrieve it?

26:25.351 --> 26:26.218
No, wait, wait...
Absolutely.

26:26.252 --> 26:28.120
Absolutely!

26:28.154 --> 26:29.789
Do whatever you want with them.

26:29.822 --> 26:31.323
I got nothing
to hide.

26:31.357 --> 26:33.292
Great.

26:33.325 --> 26:35.194
Sound like consent to me.

26:41.868 --> 26:44.804
SANFINO:
Leave a message after the beep.

26:44.837 --> 26:47.306
Yeah, Jimmy, it's Noble.

26:47.339 --> 26:49.842
I'm sorry I'm late.
I'm almost there, all right?

26:52.311 --> 26:54.246
(phone buzzing)

27:12.264 --> 27:13.966
Yeah, man, where is this diner?

27:14.000 --> 27:15.234
I'm at the corner of...

27:15.267 --> 27:16.302
JAMIE:
What are you talking about?

27:16.335 --> 27:19.071
You left me a message
to meet you at the diner.

27:19.105 --> 27:20.306
No, no, no, no, no, no.

27:20.339 --> 27:22.274
Turn around and get back in
your car, Noble.

27:22.308 --> 27:24.176
Get out of there!
What, What's going on!?

27:24.210 --> 27:26.813
I left you a message
to call me, that's all.

27:26.846 --> 27:28.080
I don't get it.

27:28.114 --> 27:30.649
To tell you that there's a hit
out on you, too!

27:32.184 --> 27:34.754
(tires squeal)

27:34.787 --> 27:35.888
Noble?

27:41.761 --> 27:42.995
(gasps)

27:43.029 --> 27:44.363
(tires squeal)

27:49.035 --> 27:51.437
Noble? Noble?

27:51.470 --> 27:54.440
Noble? Noble?!

27:59.879 --> 28:01.748
ERIN:
Enterprise Corruption,

28:01.781 --> 28:03.883
it's under the
Organized Crime Control Act.
Yeah.

28:03.916 --> 28:05.251
If you can find
hard evidence

28:05.284 --> 28:08.420
that the partners had money
on the fight and hid it,
(phone rings)

28:08.454 --> 28:12.191
or a paper trail that they
organized the event...

28:12.224 --> 28:13.192
Yeah, Jack?

28:13.225 --> 28:15.394
Yeah, I got the gloves.

28:15.427 --> 28:17.463
They're right where
he said they'd be.

28:17.496 --> 28:18.798
And?

28:18.831 --> 28:20.166
And then nothing.

28:20.199 --> 28:22.835
I'll get them right to
the lab. They're just regular

28:22.869 --> 28:24.336
12-ounce standard gloves.

28:24.370 --> 28:26.438
All right, look, hand-deliver
those gloves

28:26.472 --> 28:29.708
to the lab regardless,
all right? Yeah.

28:36.983 --> 28:38.284
And what would you have done?

28:38.317 --> 28:39.485
What, What would
I have done?

28:39.518 --> 28:41.854
I would have
stayed the...

28:41.888 --> 28:43.255
I would have stayed out
of it...

28:43.289 --> 28:44.323
the same way you should have.

28:44.356 --> 28:46.492
Like it or not, gangster
justice is very efficient.

28:46.525 --> 28:48.060
It saves taxpayer dollars.

28:48.094 --> 28:49.395
Seriously? This guy
guy gets assassinated,

28:49.428 --> 28:50.496
and that's all you've got?

28:50.529 --> 28:51.798
He got what he deserved.

28:51.831 --> 28:53.265
Where'd we adopt him
from, anyway?

28:53.299 --> 28:54.466
Let's keep it civil.

28:54.500 --> 28:55.768
This is civil.

28:57.970 --> 29:00.472
Boys, help me clear?

29:00.506 --> 29:02.141
But I'm not finished.

29:02.174 --> 29:04.376
She means we're excused.
Oh.

29:04.410 --> 29:06.045
Thank you, Nicky.

29:13.019 --> 29:15.855
Jamie, Danny's not saying
that gangster justice is right.

29:15.888 --> 29:17.990
If one person's a write-off,
then everybody is.

29:18.024 --> 29:18.891
Your heart's bleeding

29:18.925 --> 29:20.526
all over my good tablecloth.

29:20.559 --> 29:21.760
Thanks.

29:21.794 --> 29:24.530
Well, you're absolutely right.
The day we sit at this table

29:24.563 --> 29:26.065
and make a pecking order

29:26.098 --> 29:27.399
over who's expendable
and who's not is

29:27.433 --> 29:28.968
the day we lost our way.

29:30.136 --> 29:32.471
Yeah, but Danny's does have
a good point.

29:32.504 --> 29:34.807
Well, that never happens.

29:34.841 --> 29:36.042
(chuckles, phone rings)

29:36.075 --> 29:38.444
Jamie, it's not
as if Sanfino was

29:38.477 --> 29:41.914
an honor student that got hit
by a stray bullet.

29:41.948 --> 29:44.250
Excuse me.
I mean, some things are
just proscribed.

29:44.283 --> 29:45.985
What do you owe Danny for?
Yeah, Jack?

29:46.018 --> 29:46.953
What are you talking about?

29:46.986 --> 29:49.956
Danny has his own personal scale
of justice.

29:49.989 --> 29:51.390
He has every right
to choose

29:51.423 --> 29:54.026
who or what he's gonna lose
sleep over at night.

29:55.561 --> 29:56.829
I'm on my way.

29:56.863 --> 29:57.529
What's up?

29:57.563 --> 29:59.265
Rand Hilbert's in the hospital.

29:59.298 --> 30:00.199
For what?

30:00.232 --> 30:03.035
Apparently, he inhaled
his medicine cabinet.

30:03.069 --> 30:04.837
You know that "enterprise
corruption" you told me about?

30:04.871 --> 30:06.238
Yeah.
Well, if that's all
I can bring,

30:06.272 --> 30:09.141
can you at least see how much
damage I could do with it?

30:09.175 --> 30:10.809
Yep.
I got to go.
Excuse me.

30:13.145 --> 30:14.947
I'll talk to you later.
Gramps, Dad.

30:14.981 --> 30:17.583
Excuse me, too.

30:22.454 --> 30:27.493
A hundred years ago at this
family's Sunday dinner,

30:27.526 --> 30:30.062
at least one brother
or uncle at the table

30:30.096 --> 30:31.397
would have been a priest.

30:31.430 --> 30:32.531
(chuckles)

30:34.466 --> 30:36.102
You're talking about Jamie.

30:47.379 --> 30:49.381
Is he still alive?

30:49.415 --> 30:51.984
He took a bullet
and survived.

30:53.552 --> 30:55.554
Will he meet you?

30:55.587 --> 30:58.324
It's not possible under
the circumstances.

31:01.293 --> 31:03.930
You want to give him a chance
to save himself?

31:03.963 --> 31:06.465
Everybody deserves that.

31:09.668 --> 31:11.537
Call him and tell
him to meet you.

31:11.570 --> 31:14.173
Where?

31:14.206 --> 31:16.943
I can think of one safe place.

31:22.714 --> 31:25.484
DANNY:
What is it, Mr. Hilbert?
What happened?

31:25.517 --> 31:28.554
I... (sighs)

31:28.587 --> 31:33.993
I went down and asked
to see the gloves,

31:34.026 --> 31:35.561
and they showed 'em to me.

31:35.594 --> 31:37.196
The boxing gloves?

31:37.229 --> 31:39.198
Yeah.

31:39.231 --> 31:43.069
I started to think...

31:43.102 --> 31:46.973
it seemed like every punch
I landed had more on it

31:47.006 --> 31:48.507
than it felt like.

31:48.540 --> 31:52.011
Gibby was, like,

31:52.044 --> 31:55.314
rocked a few minutes into it.

31:55.347 --> 31:59.651
And I'm-I'm no great boxer.

31:59.685 --> 32:01.253
The gloves we tested,

32:01.287 --> 32:03.622
the ones my partner took
from your apartment,

32:03.655 --> 32:05.357
were they yours?

32:05.391 --> 32:08.394
No.

32:08.427 --> 32:11.063
No, they were, they were
the same,

32:11.097 --> 32:12.631
but they were different.

32:14.233 --> 32:16.468
Well, what does that mean?

32:16.502 --> 32:25.311
Mine, I-I I lifted from my
school's athletic department,

32:25.344 --> 32:31.150
and they had
a little "property of" tag

32:31.183 --> 32:33.319
on the inside if the cuff.

32:33.352 --> 32:37.423
But not the one you guys had.

32:37.456 --> 32:39.025
Are you sure about this?

32:39.058 --> 32:41.693
Yeah.

32:41.727 --> 32:44.196
Listen, listen, do you have
any idea

32:44.230 --> 32:45.631
who would want
to switch the gloves?

32:49.135 --> 32:51.137
It's all right.
Take, take it easy.

32:51.170 --> 32:52.704
Take it easy, all right?
Just...

32:52.738 --> 32:54.406
All right.

32:54.440 --> 32:56.008
(panting, groaning)

32:56.042 --> 32:58.777
Just tell me what the hell
is going on.

32:58.810 --> 33:00.212
DANNY: Listen,
it's all right.

33:00.246 --> 33:02.481
Nurse.

33:12.824 --> 33:15.094
Well, who besides
building staff

33:15.127 --> 33:16.128
would have access
to Mr. Hilbert's apartment?

33:16.162 --> 33:16.795
To Mr. Hilbert's?

33:16.828 --> 33:18.064
No telling.

33:18.097 --> 33:19.598
What do you mean?

33:19.631 --> 33:21.267
Mr. Gibson,
Mr. Hilbert--

33:21.300 --> 33:23.702
their apartments are owned
by the company they work for.

33:23.735 --> 33:25.137
Uh, Cortlandt something.

33:25.171 --> 33:26.138
Cortlandt Street Capital.

33:26.172 --> 33:27.273
Yeah.
Uh-huh.

33:27.306 --> 33:30.542
The whole "B" line, from floors
eight to 12, they own.

33:30.576 --> 33:33.679
They put the new hires there,
six months free rent.

33:33.712 --> 33:35.081
We don't know
who else has keys.

33:35.114 --> 33:36.182
Your security cameras,

33:36.215 --> 33:38.317
they record to a hard drive
over here or something?

33:38.350 --> 33:39.451
State of the art.

33:39.485 --> 33:41.587
We're going to need
a copy of that.

34:11.250 --> 34:13.085
*

34:29.135 --> 34:32.070
I'm a police officer
with the NYPD.

34:33.272 --> 34:34.706
What's your name?

34:35.741 --> 34:37.243
Just call me Jimmy.

34:37.276 --> 34:39.578
Officer Jimmy.

34:40.912 --> 34:42.448
About a half an hour ago,

34:42.481 --> 34:44.283
John Cavazzere
was placed under arrest,

34:44.316 --> 34:46.485
along with four
of his lieutenants

34:46.518 --> 34:48.454
and 13 other known associates.

34:48.487 --> 34:50.422
This concerns me how?

34:50.456 --> 34:51.623
Your uncle,
Philip Sanfino,

34:51.657 --> 34:54.160
was also placed under arrest,
along with Escalade Bobby

34:54.193 --> 34:55.661
and six other of his associates.

34:55.694 --> 34:57.196
Among the charges against him

34:57.229 --> 34:59.298
is conspiracy
to commit murder-- of you.

34:59.331 --> 35:01.500
Well, it never happened, so...

35:01.533 --> 35:03.469
(sniffs)

35:03.502 --> 35:04.670
It's all on the wire.

35:04.703 --> 35:06.172
Made you a mix tape.

35:07.206 --> 35:08.507
Funny guy.

35:08.540 --> 35:11.343
If you agree to testify
and cooperate,

35:11.377 --> 35:13.645
you'll be put back
in contact with your sister,

35:13.679 --> 35:15.347
who's already agreed

35:15.381 --> 35:17.383
and been relocated
with a new identity.

35:17.416 --> 35:19.251
She never would.

35:19.285 --> 35:21.853
She already has.

35:30.596 --> 35:33.865
FRANK: He never would
have lasted as a priest.

35:33.899 --> 35:35.367
Why do you say that?

35:35.401 --> 35:38.504
He's got the conscience,
but not the humility.

35:39.571 --> 35:40.906
Or you can walk away
right now

35:40.939 --> 35:42.308
and spend the rest
of your life

35:42.341 --> 35:43.375
looking over
your shoulder.

35:44.410 --> 35:46.445
You know they'll
find you.

35:53.852 --> 35:55.754
What's it going to be?

36:01.760 --> 36:03.262
DANNY (sighs):
Seriously, how much

36:03.295 --> 36:04.963
more of this do we
got to plow through?

36:04.996 --> 36:07.299
13 hours.
Oh.

36:07.333 --> 36:09.335
13 hours.

36:09.368 --> 36:11.337
(sighs)

36:12.704 --> 36:14.373
Ooh, zoom in on that guy.

36:17.876 --> 36:19.545
It's Gary Heller.

36:19.578 --> 36:20.712
JACKIE: Looks
like he's looking

36:20.746 --> 36:21.847
right at you.

36:24.350 --> 36:26.318
Yeah, you know, Longacre
and Thorp said they had

36:26.352 --> 36:27.486
their own security
investigating this thing.

36:27.519 --> 36:29.255
Dollars to donuts
Gary Heller's

36:29.288 --> 36:30.722
got a private
investigator's license.

36:30.756 --> 36:31.957
Come on.

36:33.292 --> 36:34.960
* I'm-a need to see

36:34.993 --> 36:36.595
* The whole crowd yellin'
* Hey *

36:36.628 --> 36:38.364
* I'm-a need to see
the whole crowd yellin' *

36:38.397 --> 36:40.232
* Hey *
* And if you're feelin' it

36:40.266 --> 36:41.333
* Feelin' it,
put your hands up *

36:41.367 --> 36:42.568
* If you're feelin' it,
feelin' it *

36:42.601 --> 36:44.670
* Put your hands up...
Excuse me, miss.

36:44.703 --> 36:47.773
Would you, uh, give Mr. Heller
and I a moment, please?

36:47.806 --> 36:49.641
Grab a booth, honey.

36:49.675 --> 36:52.210
Order a couple
of the osso buco.

36:57.649 --> 37:00.286
I wish it were anyone
but you, Reagan.

37:00.319 --> 37:01.720
Yeah, well...

37:01.753 --> 37:03.322
I think you have
something I need.

37:03.355 --> 37:05.023
Figured I might.

37:05.056 --> 37:07.559
Hence making sure
I got my picture taken.
Right.

37:07.593 --> 37:08.694
Where are the gloves?

37:08.727 --> 37:09.895
My office,
two blocks away.

37:09.928 --> 37:11.263
You check them out?

37:11.297 --> 37:12.130
Nope. Bagged them in plastic

37:12.163 --> 37:13.999
just as I found them,
made the switch.

37:14.032 --> 37:15.301
No questions asked?

37:15.334 --> 37:17.836
Only from myself to myself.

37:17.869 --> 37:20.339
And what did yourself think?

37:20.372 --> 37:21.573
Someone had heavy money
on that fight,

37:21.607 --> 37:22.608
wanted some insurance.

37:22.641 --> 37:25.377
Oh, so you suspected something.

37:25.411 --> 37:27.313
Then why not
just bring the gloves in?

37:27.346 --> 37:29.548
Because I'm a private eye now.

37:29.581 --> 37:31.950
My loyalties are to my clients,
not the NYPD.

37:31.983 --> 37:33.652
Oh, right.

37:33.685 --> 37:35.754
But you did say
that you made sure

37:35.787 --> 37:37.022
to get your picture taken

37:37.055 --> 37:39.057
just in case we wanted
to look into something.

37:39.090 --> 37:40.459
I never said that.

37:40.492 --> 37:42.027
It'd be bad for business.

37:42.060 --> 37:43.362
Right.

37:43.395 --> 37:44.430
Dundee.

37:44.463 --> 37:46.498
Two more Cutty and water
for the booth with the lady.

37:46.532 --> 37:48.334
Those two are on me.

37:48.367 --> 37:49.801
Hey.

37:49.835 --> 37:52.270
I'll get the gloves,
be back in five.

38:04.416 --> 38:05.951
You know, there's...

38:05.984 --> 38:08.320
there's one thing
that I don't get.

38:09.488 --> 38:10.856
What's that?

38:10.889 --> 38:13.725
What is in
this for you?

38:14.760 --> 38:16.495
I get to sleep at night.

38:16.528 --> 38:18.029
Oh.

38:18.063 --> 38:19.865
And that's all, huh?

38:19.898 --> 38:21.667
JAMIE:
It's a lot,

38:21.700 --> 38:23.034
your conscience
means anything to you.

38:23.068 --> 38:24.970
(laughs)
There's an assistant
United States attorney

38:25.003 --> 38:26.938
ready to talk to you.

38:26.972 --> 38:29.475
All I get's an assistant, huh?

38:29.508 --> 38:30.376
Right.

38:30.409 --> 38:33.879
Oh, okay,
so this conscience of yours,

38:33.912 --> 38:36.081
it-it lets you...

38:36.114 --> 38:38.950
gain people's trust--
perfect strangers--

38:38.984 --> 38:40.919
and then you screw them over?

38:40.952 --> 38:42.954
That's not what went down here.

38:42.988 --> 38:44.456
No?

38:44.490 --> 38:45.724
No, you're not
perfect strangers.

38:45.757 --> 38:47.626
You're criminals, and I'm a cop.

38:47.659 --> 38:49.661
Okay, let's go.

38:49.695 --> 38:51.797
You're a weasel with a badge.
Now, Sanfino.

38:51.830 --> 38:52.998
You're alive because of me.

38:54.733 --> 38:55.734
And you're welcome.

39:05.577 --> 39:06.878
DANNY:
Hey.

39:06.912 --> 39:08.414
JACKIE:
Hey.

39:08.447 --> 39:09.915
What did the lab say?
Well, apparently,

39:09.948 --> 39:12.551
some kind of saltwater solution
was injected into the gloves.

39:12.584 --> 39:14.820
Made the padding hard and made
the leather like sandpaper.

39:14.853 --> 39:16.054
For what?
I have no idea.

39:16.087 --> 39:18.790
Maybe so this guy could get
an edge on his bet on the fight.

39:18.824 --> 39:20.392
I don't know.
How much can one guy eat?

39:20.426 --> 39:21.960
I mean, what's he
going to win in the bet

39:21.993 --> 39:23.395
that he can't already
afford to buy?

39:23.429 --> 39:24.763
I don't know.

39:24.796 --> 39:26.932
The whole thing
makes me sick, seriously.

39:26.965 --> 39:28.767
Let's go arrest this mutt.
Maybe you'll feel better.

39:28.800 --> 39:30.569
Wonderful.

39:31.603 --> 39:32.938
Hello, ladies.

39:32.971 --> 39:35.006
Excuse us.

39:37.643 --> 39:39.911
(laughter)

39:39.945 --> 39:41.046
Hey, gentlemen.

39:41.079 --> 39:42.180
Good afternoon.

39:42.213 --> 39:43.682
Calling you back.

39:43.715 --> 39:45.451
You've got no right
to just barge

39:45.484 --> 39:46.885
in here like this.
Actually, we do.

39:46.918 --> 39:47.753
Josh Thorp,
you're under arrest

39:47.786 --> 39:50.622
for murder in
the second degree. Get up.

39:50.656 --> 39:51.957
Get up!

39:51.990 --> 39:53.759
Come on. Hands
behind your back.

39:53.792 --> 39:55.461
Josh, what's
going on?

39:55.494 --> 39:57.095
Well, Josh doctored
Hilbert's gloves. Yeah.

39:57.128 --> 39:58.997
Oh, and then he sent
a private investigator

39:59.030 --> 40:00.065
over to Hilbert's apartment

40:00.098 --> 40:02.200
to switch out the gloves
the day after Gibson died.

40:02.233 --> 40:03.201
What?

40:03.234 --> 40:06.004
Yeah, and now
Gibson's dead

40:06.037 --> 40:08.006
just so Thorp
could win a bet with you.

40:09.040 --> 40:09.808
Josh?

40:09.841 --> 40:11.610
You have the right
to remain silent,

40:11.643 --> 40:13.445
although it seems
like you got that memo.

40:13.479 --> 40:15.781
You know, for two smart guys,
you really are stupid.

40:15.814 --> 40:17.182
I mean, you know
the price of everything,

40:17.215 --> 40:18.817
but you know
the value of nothing.

40:18.850 --> 40:19.951
Get him out of here.

40:19.985 --> 40:22.120
Come on.

40:23.589 --> 40:26.525
I don't have anything
on you yet,

40:26.558 --> 40:28.860
but you are my new
favorite hobby.

40:32.498 --> 40:34.099
See you around.

40:38.537 --> 40:40.539
Dad.

40:40.572 --> 40:42.841
Oh. I'm off.

40:42.874 --> 40:46.044
Well, it was good
to have you here,

40:46.077 --> 40:48.814
even under
the circumstances.

40:48.847 --> 40:50.115
Good to be here.

40:50.148 --> 40:51.917
Thanks for having my back.

40:51.950 --> 40:53.619
Any time and every time.

41:02.661 --> 41:05.764
Seems that I see
the best in people

41:05.797 --> 41:07.198
even when nobody else can.

41:07.232 --> 41:08.900
Just the way I'm built.

41:08.934 --> 41:11.937
Hmm.
That's got to be an asset
in some line of work,

41:11.970 --> 41:15.140
but I think it may be
a handicap... for a cop.

41:17.175 --> 41:18.243
Just something to think about.
