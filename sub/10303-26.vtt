01:20.940 --> 01:23.215
Steak again, Peg?

01:24.180 --> 01:27.092
Well, that's four nights in a row.

01:27.340 --> 01:28.375
Oh, I'm sorry, Al.

01:28.580 --> 01:32.414
But steak is all
that Kelly's secret admirer sent over.

01:33.580 --> 01:36.538
I thought we had a lobster
around here.

01:36.740 --> 01:38.492
Wonder what could have
happened to it.

01:47.460 --> 01:51.339
<i>No drawn butter?
What do they think I am?</i>

01:52.740 --> 01:55.413
<i>Bud, would you like
some crème brûlée?</i>

01:55.660 --> 01:59.289
<i>- No, I don't want any crème brûlée.
- Good. More for me.</i>

02:00.140 --> 02:03.291
Aren't you two curious
about who is sending all this stuff?

02:03.500 --> 02:05.889
I mean, some mystery guy
sees Kelly on a commercial...

02:06.100 --> 02:07.852
...starts lavishing us with presents.

02:08.060 --> 02:10.175
- He could be a maniac.
- Oh, Bud.

02:10.380 --> 02:14.134
Maniacs don't send nice gifts
like roses and chocolates...

02:14.340 --> 02:17.138
...and Chanel No. 5.

02:19.540 --> 02:22.816
I, for one, will not gorge myself
on my sister's misfortune.

02:23.020 --> 02:24.772
As you say.

02:29.980 --> 02:31.618
Hey, guys.

02:36.740 --> 02:39.459
Guess what my secret admirer
brought for me today.

02:39.700 --> 02:42.976
Twelve long-stem roses.

02:43.260 --> 02:45.820
Al, how come
you never send me roses?

02:46.060 --> 02:48.335
I don't like you, Peg.

02:50.620 --> 02:53.373
Anyway, Mom, I was at my audition
for Easy-Off Jeans.

02:53.580 --> 02:57.493
The jeans so tight, you're the only one
who knows you're wearing pants?

02:57.700 --> 03:01.898
Now, this is a nationwide commercial.
I mean, all 13 colonies.

03:02.900 --> 03:04.731
So naturally I was really nervous.

03:04.940 --> 03:08.694
Then all of a sudden this delivery guy
brings me these flowers.

03:09.900 --> 03:11.856
Any pork?

03:12.660 --> 03:15.174
No, Daddy, but the card said...

03:15.380 --> 03:19.089
...that my secret admirer is gonna
come over here today at 5:30.

03:19.340 --> 03:21.171
Tell him to bring pork.

03:22.180 --> 03:23.977
Dad, don't you know
what that means?

03:24.220 --> 03:25.619
He's stalking her.

03:25.860 --> 03:28.374
I know, I've done this to women.

03:33.260 --> 03:34.932
I mean, I mean, I know...

03:35.140 --> 03:37.938
...I watch a lot
of Eric Roberts' movies.

03:38.940 --> 03:41.818
Budkenstein, first of all...

03:42.060 --> 03:46.019
...following your hand to bed
is not considered stalking.

03:49.980 --> 03:53.256
And second of all,
stalkers don't invite you to the opera.

03:53.460 --> 03:54.654
Look.

03:54.860 --> 03:56.930
"L.A. Boom."

03:58.060 --> 04:01.291
<i>That's La Bohème, you pincushion.</i>

04:01.500 --> 04:05.618
Mom, are you really letting Kelly go off
with a complete and total stranger?

04:05.860 --> 04:08.169
Look, Bud, I am a woman.

04:08.420 --> 04:12.299
And we felines have a way
of picking the right guy.

04:12.540 --> 04:15.418
That's why nobody has picked you.

04:15.660 --> 04:18.618
Now, trust me. I know a Mr. Right
when I see him.

04:20.019 --> 04:21.418
Kelly.

04:21.660 --> 04:25.699
- Stitch, what are you doing here?
- Kelly...

04:26.260 --> 04:30.538
...I fear the chrome on the ball hitch
of our love is flaking.

04:31.700 --> 04:34.294
So tell me,
you seeing someone else?

04:35.100 --> 04:37.489
Is there a Kelly Bundy here?

04:37.740 --> 04:39.651
- I'm Kelly Bundy.
- I'm Kelly Bundy.

04:41.500 --> 04:43.172
Thanks.

04:43.380 --> 04:47.259
Just tell me, Kelly. I can take it.
Are you seeing someone else?

04:49.100 --> 04:50.818
Look, Stitch, it's nothing personal.

04:51.020 --> 04:54.456
It's just that I found someone
who knows how to treat me like a lady.

04:54.700 --> 04:59.490
Hey, when we go out to dinner
don't I let you talk in the clown's head?

05:00.540 --> 05:05.011
Listen, Stitch, what my daughter
is trying to say is that...

05:11.060 --> 05:14.496
...she may not be ready
for a commitment just yet.

05:20.100 --> 05:23.217
But don't take it personally.
Hey, I like you.

05:23.460 --> 05:27.009
If you'd be happy with a friendship,
instead of a relationship...

05:27.220 --> 05:29.688
...you can come here
whenever you want to.

05:43.820 --> 05:47.335
I can't believe you guys are cleaning
for a total stranger.

05:47.940 --> 05:50.773
Hey, you find some rich guy
who keeps us knee-deep in steaks...

05:50.980 --> 05:52.811
...we'll clean for him too.

05:53.780 --> 05:57.295
Hey, Al, I think this thing is broken.

06:00.980 --> 06:03.448
Unlike many of your other devices...

06:03.660 --> 06:05.935
...that one doesn't need batteries.

06:09.500 --> 06:11.092
See, you plug that in.

06:11.820 --> 06:13.492
But where?

06:14.140 --> 06:16.813
Well, I could think
of some places, Peg.

06:19.580 --> 06:23.289
That must be
Kelly's gentleman caller.

06:23.940 --> 06:26.215
Oh, Al, a limo.

06:26.420 --> 06:28.058
Take me.

06:28.300 --> 06:30.939
Come on. Peg, I just ate.

06:32.020 --> 06:34.215
He's here. He's here.

06:39.180 --> 06:41.296
I have never been
so nervous in my life.

06:41.500 --> 06:43.491
I'm on the edge of my feet.

06:43.700 --> 06:46.692
Kelly. Kelly.
I'm gonna try this one last time.

06:46.940 --> 06:50.057
- Please think about what you're doing.
- Okay.

06:50.260 --> 06:52.933
I'm thinking. I'm thinking.
I'm doing.

07:02.060 --> 07:04.415
Hello, Miss Bundy.
My name is Robby Bennett.

07:04.620 --> 07:07.214
<i>I believe you're accompanying me
to La Bohème.</i>

07:11.220 --> 07:14.974
- You're my secret admirer?
- That's right.

07:19.980 --> 07:24.337
Oh, you are one cool guy.

07:29.460 --> 07:34.739
Robby, my man.
Come on in, buddy. Have a seat.

07:35.260 --> 07:38.935
Can I get you a drink?
Yoo-hoo with a Bosco back?

07:39.300 --> 07:41.416
A soda would be cool.

07:41.700 --> 07:45.659
And for you, little missy,
shall I warm your ba-ba?

07:47.060 --> 07:49.813
Get away from me, demon seed.

07:50.700 --> 07:51.894
Excuse me, Opie.

07:52.100 --> 07:54.773
- Robby.
- Of course.

07:55.020 --> 07:56.533
Mom, Dad, what am I going to do?

07:56.740 --> 07:59.891
Well, charm him and conveniently
forget to sign the prenup.

08:00.140 --> 08:01.459
Mom?

08:01.660 --> 08:04.254
Well, he's kind of cute.

08:04.500 --> 08:06.616
He's a fetus.

08:09.140 --> 08:10.573
Here you go.

08:18.060 --> 08:20.415
Well, Robby,
just between you and me...

08:20.660 --> 08:22.571
...Kelly always did like
a man in uniform.

08:22.820 --> 08:26.574
So are you in the Cub Scouts
or Little League or anything?

08:26.820 --> 08:28.811
Get over here, dung beetle.

08:29.060 --> 08:30.652
Now, what am I going to do?

08:30.900 --> 08:35.256
Okay, just answer me three questions,
all right. One, how funny is this?

08:35.700 --> 08:37.929
Two, who the man?

08:38.659 --> 08:41.777
And three, how funny is this?

08:47.780 --> 08:50.897
Somehow, some way,
I will get you for this.

08:51.140 --> 08:55.213
Robby, hi.
I think we need to talk.

08:55.460 --> 08:59.294
Isn't that cute, Al?
They want to be alone.

09:05.060 --> 09:07.176
Maybe we should go outside.

09:15.940 --> 09:19.137
Kelly, before you say anything.

09:27.020 --> 09:30.615
Would you excuse me
for just a second?

09:36.900 --> 09:38.094
As I was saying...

09:38.300 --> 09:40.495
...you're the most beautiful girl
I've ever seen.

09:40.700 --> 09:43.658
And I'd like to take you
to my graduation dance.

09:43.860 --> 09:45.452
Oh, Robby.

09:45.700 --> 09:48.260
This is all very sweet
and everything...

09:48.460 --> 09:51.975
...but, you see,
our love could never be.

09:52.220 --> 09:56.577
I mean, it's a maturity thing.
I mean, what are you, like 3?

09:57.420 --> 09:58.853
Twelve and a half.

09:59.220 --> 10:01.176
Well, Robby, I can't date
a 12-year-old.

10:01.420 --> 10:04.730
I mean, sure, when I was 6,
but it's different now.

10:05.740 --> 10:07.617
- Do you understand?
- No.

10:07.820 --> 10:11.495
- I don't understand.
- Well, good, I'm gla-- What?

10:11.740 --> 10:15.210
Do you think I gave you beef
and roses just to get blown off?

10:15.460 --> 10:17.337
The Bennett family motto is:

10:17.540 --> 10:21.010
"We see it, we want it, we get it."

10:24.820 --> 10:27.380
Well, the Bundy family motto is:

10:27.580 --> 10:31.619
"It sees us, insults us,
we kick its ass."

10:39.780 --> 10:42.214
Do you know who my dad is?

10:42.500 --> 10:44.377
Sure. Your father.

10:46.020 --> 10:47.214
Well, yeah.

10:47.420 --> 10:51.652
But he also owns Bennett Enterprises,
which owns Easy-Off Jeans.

10:53.620 --> 10:56.134
So here's the deal.

10:56.380 --> 10:59.531
You're on my arm at the prom
and you get the commercial.

10:59.740 --> 11:02.698
You turn me down
and I promise you...

11:02.900 --> 11:05.619
...you'll never work
in this town again.

11:12.260 --> 11:13.409
Bud, you're my manager.

11:13.620 --> 11:15.531
You're supposed to be opening
doors for me.

11:15.740 --> 11:18.334
Now, what am I paying you
55 percent for?

11:20.580 --> 11:23.811
How was I supposed to know you were
gonna start saying no to men?

11:25.060 --> 11:27.858
All right, so you dance with a guy
who comes up to your navel.

11:28.060 --> 11:30.779
It'll prepare you for later on
in your showbiz career...

11:31.020 --> 11:35.775
...when you're dancing
with Stallone or Cruise or k.d. lang.

11:39.100 --> 11:40.692
Well, I guess you're right.

11:40.940 --> 11:43.977
I mean, it's obvious
that this kid has some power, so...

11:44.180 --> 11:46.171
...I might as well go
to the dance with him.

11:46.380 --> 11:48.894
- There you go.
- And what's the big deal, anyway?

11:49.100 --> 11:51.330
Lots of starlets go out
with younger guys, right?

11:51.540 --> 11:55.613
Cher, Madonna, Liberace.

11:57.380 --> 11:59.132
I mean, it's just a junior prom.

11:59.340 --> 12:03.015
I can do this with my eyes closed
and my hands tied behind my back.

12:03.260 --> 12:06.172
That's sort of like
one of your real dates then, right?

12:10.740 --> 12:12.617
You're fired.

12:31.180 --> 12:33.933
Whoa, look what Robby brought.

12:37.860 --> 12:40.818
She's huge for a sixth-grader.

12:41.460 --> 12:44.816
I heard her talking outside.
I think she just got held back.

12:47.540 --> 12:49.974
I bet you they're fake.

12:52.940 --> 12:56.091
- Fun punch?
- Groin kick?

13:00.100 --> 13:02.409
Okay, Robby,
this is how it's going to be.

13:02.660 --> 13:03.979
You have two hours.

13:04.180 --> 13:07.013
No talking, no touching.

13:07.220 --> 13:09.370
If you ever call me
your "main squeeze" again...

13:09.580 --> 13:12.253
...you will not live to see
your face clear up.

13:13.180 --> 13:15.057
Fine. I only have one rule.

13:15.260 --> 13:17.376
You have to dance
every dance with me.

13:17.620 --> 13:19.895
- Then do I get the commercial?
- Deal.

13:20.100 --> 13:21.453
And wait till you hear the DJ.

13:21.660 --> 13:23.890
I found him in one of those hip-hop
dance clubs.

13:24.100 --> 13:25.658
I hear he's slamming.

13:34.660 --> 13:37.936
Now, you don't mind
if I make a few adjustments...

13:38.140 --> 13:40.051
...to your song list now, do you?

13:40.420 --> 13:44.049
Hello, departing graduates
of Gale Sayers Middle School.

13:44.300 --> 13:47.337
Hello, Principal Alburton.

13:47.540 --> 13:49.417
Oh, Robby. Nice catch.

13:53.980 --> 13:58.337
And now, please welcome
tonight's happening rapping DJ...

13:58.540 --> 14:00.531
...Rockafella.

14:04.860 --> 14:10.969
Yo, yo, yo.
DJ Rockafella's in the house.

14:11.300 --> 14:14.895
Hold the bus. I know that house.

14:15.140 --> 14:18.815
Now, tonight, instead of the usual
phat beats and bass lines...

14:19.060 --> 14:22.848
...I thought we'd slow it down a little
as a tribute to the Walrus of Love...

14:23.060 --> 14:25.415
...Mr. Barry White.

14:33.300 --> 14:35.177
Let's dance.

14:35.420 --> 14:39.857
- But this is a slow song.
- You said, every dance.

14:47.380 --> 14:51.259
DJ Rockafella's sending shouts-out
to all the players over there...

14:51.460 --> 14:53.257
...and all the fly honeys over here.

14:53.500 --> 14:56.094
But I'm giving mad props
to my boy Robby...

14:56.300 --> 14:58.211
...and to his lady of the night.

15:00.340 --> 15:03.013
I mean, of tonight.

15:14.180 --> 15:15.818
Bud, you've got to help me.

15:16.060 --> 15:18.620
Hey, I would like to,
but you fired me.

15:18.860 --> 15:21.772
And I only took this gig
to make ends meet.

15:22.500 --> 15:25.936
Okay, okay, you're unfired.
Now just get me out of this.

15:26.140 --> 15:28.529
- Play something fast.
- Okay.

15:28.780 --> 15:30.498
But I want 80 percent.

15:30.740 --> 15:33.857
And I want a photo of you
and Robby together.

15:34.620 --> 15:35.814
Why?

15:36.020 --> 15:38.488
In case someday I want 90 percent.

15:39.660 --> 15:41.218
Okay, okay, just--

16:00.020 --> 16:02.659
You know, Kelly,
I have a birthday party coming up...

16:02.860 --> 16:05.294
...and I bet you look pretty hot
in a swimsuit.

16:05.500 --> 16:08.094
I think I just might keep you.

16:09.500 --> 16:12.298
Look, Macaulay, this is America.

16:14.620 --> 16:17.453
And nobody owns anybody
in America.

16:17.660 --> 16:21.619
Except for maybe the guy
who is married to Anna Nicole Smith.

16:22.700 --> 16:24.531
You certainly do not own me.

16:24.780 --> 16:29.092
Well, then I guess you don't care
about your career.

16:29.460 --> 16:33.214
<i>Not if it means kissing
your little Power Ranger butt.</i>

16:37.100 --> 16:39.773
You know, I have a mind
to tell your father about this.

16:40.020 --> 16:43.376
Go ahead. My father has
no control over me.

16:43.580 --> 16:48.370
I'm almost 13. I do and say
what I want, when I want.

16:48.620 --> 16:52.295
And now, boys and girls,
Principal Alburton.

16:52.540 --> 16:54.610
I'd like to introduce
a very special guest...

16:54.820 --> 16:59.291
...and the power behind King Robby,
his dad, Bennett J. Bennett.

17:01.980 --> 17:03.811
Hello, son.

17:05.940 --> 17:07.817
Hi, Dad.

17:08.700 --> 17:10.770
- New tie?
- Yup.

17:11.020 --> 17:13.329
Same old belt though.

17:21.380 --> 17:23.848
But we'll talk about that later.

17:24.300 --> 17:26.939
Thanks for the phone call, homey.

17:28.300 --> 17:31.372
- Word up.
- I owe you.

17:31.620 --> 17:35.329
Hey, listen, Kelly gets that jeans gig
and we'll call it even.

17:35.580 --> 17:37.411
Done.

17:38.380 --> 17:39.574
Let's go, son.

17:39.820 --> 17:42.892
Another time-out, Dad?

17:43.140 --> 17:46.815
Maybe. If the belt unravels.

17:52.740 --> 17:54.173
Hey, thank you, Bud.

17:54.740 --> 17:56.173
Any time, Kel.

17:56.380 --> 17:59.099
Hope I didn't embarrass you
too much out there.

17:59.860 --> 18:02.738
- It's okay.
- Really?

18:02.980 --> 18:04.891
Well, let's try this then.

18:06.260 --> 18:08.820
Now, boys and girls, I'd like to read
a little excerpt...

18:09.020 --> 18:11.215
...from Queen Easy's royal diary.

18:16.420 --> 18:18.980
"November 43rd.

18:22.420 --> 18:25.856
Today I developed a rather
embarrassing personal problem."

18:30.620 --> 18:32.770
Won't you at least
have a pork chop, Bud?

18:32.980 --> 18:35.540
No, I don't want any
of your tainted pork.

18:36.620 --> 18:40.374
Does no one but me worry
that Kelly's now dating Robby's dad?

18:45.420 --> 18:47.331
The guy's 20 years older than her.

18:48.420 --> 18:51.014
Are you never happy?

19:01.780 --> 19:04.419
<i>Thank you for taking me
to Madame Butterfly, Bennett.</i>

19:04.660 --> 19:08.289
It's kind of disappointing though.
I mean, there was no caterpillar...

19:08.500 --> 19:10.172
...there was no cocoon...

19:10.380 --> 19:13.895
...there was no struggle to break free
in the spring.

19:14.140 --> 19:16.335
God, you're beautiful.

19:16.660 --> 19:22.178
- Oh, Al, isn't this sweet?
- The sweetest.

19:24.220 --> 19:26.688
Anyway, Kelly, I just want to say...

19:26.900 --> 19:29.653
...that I've really fallen for you
these last few weeks.

19:29.860 --> 19:31.896
You're everything
I've ever wanted in a woman.

19:32.100 --> 19:36.252
You're young and blonde and young.

19:38.380 --> 19:39.574
Will you marry me?

19:45.700 --> 19:48.089
Would you excuse me
for just a minute?

19:49.420 --> 19:53.208
Mom, how do you know
if someone is Mr. Right?

19:53.460 --> 19:57.055
Well, when you're with him
do you hear bells?

19:57.300 --> 19:58.858
No.

19:59.060 --> 20:03.178
Oh, it doesn't matter.
He's rich, marry him anyway.

20:03.420 --> 20:05.536
- Daddy, what do you think?
- Gary.

20:05.740 --> 20:08.015
Yeah. Al Bundy. Remember me?

20:08.220 --> 20:11.292
I used to work for you
when we were poor.

20:11.980 --> 20:14.494
Yeah, we're moving on up.

20:16.380 --> 20:19.417
That's right, to the east side.

20:26.180 --> 20:28.375
Well, how about it, Kelly?

20:29.140 --> 20:31.370
Will you be my wife?

20:31.700 --> 20:34.931
- Well, I--
- Kelly.

20:36.420 --> 20:38.934
Something is still not right.

20:39.620 --> 20:43.215
I can't shake this feeling
that there's someone else.

20:45.700 --> 20:48.692
But in case our love can never be...

20:48.900 --> 20:50.777
...I wanted you to have this.

20:57.820 --> 21:01.779
Oh, Stitch, you are much man.

21:06.540 --> 21:08.132
I'm sorry, Bennett.

21:08.340 --> 21:13.095
But as the Chinese philosopher
Unconscious once said:

21:14.820 --> 21:17.971
"It is better to have loved and lost...

21:18.180 --> 21:21.377
<i>...than to have never seen
Lost In Space at all."</i>

21:28.900 --> 21:33.018
Well, in seven years
she would have been 30.

21:35.980 --> 21:38.096
Think we should tell Dad?

21:38.420 --> 21:41.332
No, I mean, look at him.

21:41.620 --> 21:44.293
When will you ever see him
that happy again?

21:45.305 --> 21:51.387
