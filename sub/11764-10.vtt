WEBVTT

00:02.173 --> 00:04.035
DID HOLLY PICK UP JILL YET?

00:04.035 --> 00:06.377
YEAH. THIS IS MY BABY.

00:06.377 --> 00:08.439
WHY DO YOU ALWAYS FREAK OUT
WHENEVER HOLLY COMES OVER?

00:08.439 --> 00:10.010
SHE'S NOT THAT BAD.

00:10.010 --> 00:11.742
AM I ALLOWED TO SAY THAT

00:11.742 --> 00:14.285
ABOUT A WOMAN I ACCIDENTALLY
HAD A BABY WITH?

00:14.285 --> 00:16.187
I WOULDN'T.
SHE ALWAYS WANTS TO HANG

00:16.187 --> 00:18.649
AND CONNECT WITH ME
OVER TEQUILA SHOTS.

00:18.649 --> 00:19.720
JUST SAY NO. (chuckles)

00:19.720 --> 00:21.552
I CAN'T SAY NO TO TEQUILA.

00:21.552 --> 00:23.654
THAT'S WHY TRAVIS EXISTS.

00:23.654 --> 00:25.396
NO WAY. JILL, TOO.

00:25.396 --> 00:26.757
WHAT AN ADORABLE COINCIDENCE.

00:26.757 --> 00:28.129
LOOK ON THE BRIGHT SIDE.

00:28.129 --> 00:31.062
SHE DRIVES YOU CRAZY,
WHICH I ENJOY.

00:31.062 --> 00:32.032
(chuckles sarcastically)

00:32.032 --> 00:33.134
(horn honks)

00:33.134 --> 00:35.366
SHE'S HERE. COME HERE.

00:35.366 --> 00:39.210
IF SHE PUSHES PAST US
WITH HER SUPER BIMBO STRENGTH,

00:39.210 --> 00:41.041
WE SAY
WE CAN'T HANG TONIGHT...
(vehicle door closes,
alarm chirps)

00:41.041 --> 00:44.175
BECAUSE WE ALL HAVE SOME
VERY IMPORTANT THING TO GO TO.

00:44.175 --> 00:45.216
GOT IT.

00:45.216 --> 00:47.718
HEY, YOU GUYS.
WHOOPS. WHOA. (chuckles)

00:47.718 --> 00:49.720
DAMN IT.
SHE BACKDOORED US.

00:49.720 --> 00:53.084
JULES, I HAVE SO MUCH I GOTTA
TALK TO YOU ABOUT. (chuckles)

00:53.084 --> 00:55.826
(chuckles) I'M SORRY. WE CAN'T
HANG BECAUSE WE ALL HAVE

00:55.826 --> 01:00.060
A VERY IMPORTANT THING
WE HAVE TO GO TO, SO...
(refrigerator door
opens and closes)

01:00.060 --> 01:01.492
THAT THING GOT CANCELED.

01:01.492 --> 01:05.196
I DO HAVE A DIFFERENT THING
THAT ONLY I HAVE TO GO TO.

01:05.196 --> 01:09.100
YOU KNOW WHAT? I'LL DRIVE YOU.
HAVE FUN, MOM.

01:09.100 --> 01:10.241
SHOULD WE CONNECT?

01:10.241 --> 01:12.173
(laughs)

01:12.173 --> 01:13.674
YEAH. (sighs)
(door closes)

01:14.675 --> 01:15.676
OHH.

01:15.676 --> 01:18.179
(clink)

01:18.179 --> 01:23.214
в™Єв™Єв™Є

01:23.214 --> 01:24.315
ARE YOU HAPPY?

01:24.315 --> 01:27.418
I HAD TO LISTEN TO HOLLY YAP
FOR OVER AN HOUR.

01:27.418 --> 01:29.220
SHE'S WAY TOO YOUNG TO HAVE
THAT MANY STORIES

01:29.220 --> 01:31.622
ABOUT LOSING TEETH.
(chuckles) SORRY.

01:31.622 --> 01:34.665
THAT'S THE LEAST CONVINCING
"SORRY" EVER.
I'LL WORK ON IT.

01:34.665 --> 01:37.328
SO JULES AND I DECIDED WE WANT
TO GET MARRIED ON THE BEACH.

01:37.328 --> 01:38.799
(gasps) YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO GO TO CITY HALL

01:38.799 --> 01:40.371
AND GET A PERMIT FOR THAT.

01:40.371 --> 01:42.773
OOH. THAT SOUNDS LIKE
QUITE AN IMBROGLIO.

01:42.773 --> 01:46.807
SHE BOUGHT HERSELF A LITTLE
WORD-OF-THE-DAY CALENDAR.

01:46.807 --> 01:48.139
AH.
GOTCHA.

01:48.139 --> 01:49.310
WHY WOULD YOU BUST ME
ON THAT?

01:49.310 --> 01:50.311
THEY WOULD HAVE
JUST THOUGHT

01:50.311 --> 01:52.343
I HAD GOTTEN ALL SMART
AND STUFF.

01:52.343 --> 01:53.714
SORRY.

01:53.714 --> 01:54.815
OH, NO. THAT WAS BETTER.

01:54.815 --> 01:56.147
RIGHT? I'M GETTING IT.

01:56.147 --> 01:57.117
GETTING A PERMIT IS EASY.

01:57.117 --> 01:58.789
I GOT ONE TO PUT
THAT NEW SPEED BUMP

01:58.789 --> 02:00.321
IN THE CUL-DE-SAC.

02:02.393 --> 02:03.824
UHH! OHH!

02:06.757 --> 02:10.261
THAT SPEED BUMP IS GONNA PROTECT
OUR KIDS, ESPECIALLY STAN.

02:10.261 --> 02:12.163
HE'S OBSESSED WITH THAT MANHOLE
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET.

02:12.163 --> 02:13.664
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
HE THINKS IS DOWN THERE,

02:13.664 --> 02:15.466
BUT HE LEAVES FOOD FOR IT.

02:15.466 --> 02:17.368
WELL,
IT'S THE MANHOLE MONSTER.

02:17.368 --> 02:20.211
IT EATS LITTLE BOYS
THAT DON'T LISTEN.

02:20.211 --> 02:21.872
SOLID PARENTING, AS ALWAYS.

02:21.872 --> 02:23.244
(whispers) THANKS.

02:25.476 --> 02:28.179
ROGER! (chuckles)

02:28.179 --> 02:30.381
ROGER. (chuckles)
HOW ARE YOU?

02:30.381 --> 02:32.323
OH, SAME AS ALWAYS.

02:32.323 --> 02:34.154
ACTUALLY, I WAS MARRIED
A FEW MONTHS AGO,

02:34.154 --> 02:35.326
SO SLIGHTLY WORSE.

02:35.326 --> 02:37.728
(laughs, lowered voice)
OH, GOD.

02:37.728 --> 02:39.190
NEXT.
EXCUSE ME.

02:39.190 --> 02:42.233
I WANT TO GET A PERMIT
FOR A BEACH WEDDING.

02:42.233 --> 02:43.934
WE DON'T ALLOW WEDDINGS
ON THE BEACH.

02:43.934 --> 02:46.267
BUT I SEE PARTIES
ON THE BEACH ALL THE TIME.

02:46.267 --> 02:47.668
WE ALLOW PARTIES.

02:47.668 --> 02:50.271
OKAY, THEN I WANT
A PERMIT FOR A PARTY.

02:50.271 --> 02:51.942
WILL THERE BE A PRIEST
AT YOUR PARTY?

02:51.942 --> 02:54.305
(chuckles) DEPENDS ON
HOW CRAZY IT GETS.

02:54.305 --> 02:55.246
NO PERMIT.

02:55.246 --> 02:57.348
IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM,
TALK TO THE MAYOR.

02:57.348 --> 02:59.950
THIS PODUNK TOWN
HAS A MAYOR? WHO?

02:59.950 --> 03:01.252
ME.

03:01.252 --> 03:02.253
(chuckles) STOP IT.
(chuckles)

03:02.253 --> 03:03.554
(chuckles)

03:03.554 --> 03:05.686
NO, REALLY. IT'S ME.

03:07.218 --> 03:10.391
I LOVE THIS
CAKE SHOP/REAL ESTATE OFFICE.

03:10.391 --> 03:11.592
YOU GIVE ME
DAY-OLD BLACK-AND-WHITE COOKIES,

03:11.592 --> 03:13.524
AND JULES LETS ME TAKE COFFEE
FROM HER SIDE.

03:13.524 --> 03:14.795
(mouth full)
MM. THE COFFEE'S FREE?

03:14.795 --> 03:17.898
OH, I'M SORRY, SIR.
YOU'LL HAVE TO BUY A CONDO.

03:17.898 --> 03:19.199
AH.
(chuckles)

03:19.199 --> 03:21.702
(chuckles) WHOO, MAN,
THAT CAMERA CAKE LOOKS REAL.

03:21.702 --> 03:23.704
I'LL BET YOU WISH YOU HAD
THAT SUCKER

03:23.704 --> 03:25.506
HANGING AROUND YOUR NECK.
(chuckles)

03:25.506 --> 03:27.408
WHY, BECAUSE I'M ASIAN?

03:27.408 --> 03:29.209
NO! (scoffs)
(mouth full) YEAH.

03:29.209 --> 03:31.342
THE LONG "NO" MEANS
"STOP TALKING."

03:31.342 --> 03:32.583
JUST ANOTHER GOOD OLD BOY

03:32.583 --> 03:34.945
THROWING RACIST STEREOTYPES
AROUND.

03:34.945 --> 03:37.388
RACIST? AM I THAT BAD?

03:37.388 --> 03:39.550
NO, SWEETIE.

03:39.550 --> 03:42.293
OH, MY GOD. LOOK AT
YOUR BLACK-AND-WHITE COOKIE.

03:42.293 --> 03:44.255
YOU'VE ONLY EATEN
THE WHITE PART.

03:44.255 --> 03:46.226
I'M A MONSTER.

03:46.226 --> 03:49.900
GOOD! LEAVE!
I DON'T EVEN CARE!

03:49.900 --> 03:52.533
(scoffs)

03:52.533 --> 03:53.904
HEY. (chuckles)

03:53.904 --> 03:54.905
EH.

03:54.905 --> 03:56.637
UH, EVERYTHING OKAY?

03:56.637 --> 03:58.469
STUPID INTERNET DATE.

03:58.469 --> 03:59.940
I THOUGHT HAVING A BABY
WAS GONNA BE, LIKE,

03:59.940 --> 04:02.743
A NONSTOP PARTY...
(chuckles) YOU KNOW?

04:02.743 --> 04:06.347
WRONG. TURNS OUT THEY'RE
A TOTAL CROTCH-BLOCK.

04:06.347 --> 04:07.348
THAT GUY IS A TOOL.

04:07.348 --> 04:10.381
HE SHOULD HAVE PUT
"HATES BABIES" ON HIS PROFILE.

04:10.381 --> 04:12.353
OH, HE DID.
I JUST IGNORED IT.

04:12.353 --> 04:13.454
(giggles)

04:13.454 --> 04:14.625
HEY, WE WERE GONNA GO GET
SOME ICE CREAM.

04:14.625 --> 04:15.986
DO YOU WANT TO COME?

04:15.986 --> 04:17.488
CAN BABIES HAVE ICE CREAM?

04:17.488 --> 04:19.760
OH, YEAH. THAT'S, LIKE,
PRETTY MUCH ALL SHE EATS.

04:19.760 --> 04:22.433
(laughs)

04:22.433 --> 04:24.635
THERE'S GOT TO BE SOMETHING
YOU CAN DO.

04:24.635 --> 04:26.667
I MEAN, I HAVE BEEN DREAMING
OF HAVING A BEACH WEDDING

04:26.667 --> 04:29.570
SINCE... WELL, YESTERDAY.

04:29.570 --> 04:31.402
I KNOW WHERE THIS IS GOING.

04:31.402 --> 04:33.774
YOU THINK IT WOULD BE
SAFE FOR US TO HAVE

04:33.774 --> 04:37.408
A QUICK
BUT PASSIONATE FLING.

04:38.849 --> 04:40.711
I'M FLATTERED...

04:40.711 --> 04:43.354
(nasal voice) BUT IT'S NOT
GONNA HAPPEN. (chuckles)

04:43.354 --> 04:44.515
I'LL TRY TO KEEP IT
IN MY PANTS.

04:44.515 --> 04:45.756
THAT'S A GOOD GIRL.

04:45.756 --> 04:47.388
SO WHO DID YOU MARRY
ANYWAY?

04:47.388 --> 04:48.389
AH.

04:48.389 --> 04:50.060
WELL, HELLO, JULES.
HI.

04:50.060 --> 04:55.295
AW. WHAT
AN ADORABLE ENGAGEMENT RING.

04:55.295 --> 04:58.298
IT'S LIKE MY RING HAD
A BABY. (laughs)

04:58.298 --> 05:00.401
WOW. BARB, YOU'RE MARRIED.
MM.

05:00.401 --> 05:02.903
(chuckles) I'M SO, UM...

05:02.903 --> 05:04.905
UM, SOMETHING FOR YOU.

05:04.905 --> 05:06.076
(both laugh)

05:06.076 --> 05:07.878
OH, YOU WOULD HAVE LOVED
OUR WEDDING.

05:07.878 --> 05:09.610
WE HAD
THE MOST SPECTACULAR CEREMONY

05:09.610 --> 05:12.343
ON THE BEACH.

05:12.343 --> 05:13.584
IT WAS MORE LIKE A PARTY.

05:13.584 --> 05:14.815
YEAH.

05:14.815 --> 05:17.648
YOU KNOW HOW I'M ALWAYS
TALKING ABOUT POLITICS?

05:17.648 --> 05:18.649
NOT ONCE.
NOT EVER.

05:18.649 --> 05:20.421
THIS TOWN NEEDS
A NEW MAYOR,

05:20.421 --> 05:22.893
AND NOT ONE THAT'S IN BED
WITH "BIG BUSINESS."

05:22.893 --> 05:25.325
THAT'S WHAT BARB CALLS
HER PRIVATE PARTS.

05:25.325 --> 05:27.097
YOU KNOW WHO'D BE GREAT?

05:27.097 --> 05:28.959
JOHN MAYER.

05:28.959 --> 05:31.762
(gasps) "MAYOR MAYER"--
IT SOUNDS REALLY FUNNY.

05:31.762 --> 05:34.334
PLUS HE COULD TOTALLY
SHAKE THINGS UP...

05:34.334 --> 05:36.336
(deep voice) IN MY PANTS.

05:36.336 --> 05:37.768
I THINK
IT SHOULD BE YOU, ANDY.

05:37.768 --> 05:39.670
ME?
YOU LOVE GETTING INVOLVED.

05:39.670 --> 05:41.412
YOU PETITIONED
AGAINST THE NEW MALL.

05:41.412 --> 05:43.774
YOU PUT IN THAT NEW SPEED BUMP
WE ALL HATE.

05:43.774 --> 05:46.717
PLUS YOU WOULD LOOK
SO GREAT KISSING A BABY

05:46.717 --> 05:49.019
'CAUSE YOU KINDA LOOK
LIKE A BABY,

05:49.019 --> 05:50.350
AND EVERYONE KNOWS
THERE'S NOTHING CUTER

05:50.350 --> 05:52.022
THAN A BABY KISSING A BABY.

05:52.022 --> 05:53.424
TRUTH.

05:53.424 --> 05:55.055
I ACTUALLY THINK I WOULD BE
A GREAT MAYOR.

05:55.055 --> 05:57.087
I LOVE HELPING PEOPLE,
AND AT PARADES,

05:57.087 --> 05:59.730
YOU GET TO WEAR A TOP HAT
LIKE THE MONOPOLY GUY.

05:59.730 --> 06:01.432
(gasps)

06:01.432 --> 06:03.694
STAN, YOU BETTER NOT BE TAKING
THAT TO THE MANHOLE MONSTER.

06:03.694 --> 06:05.466
BUT HE'S MY BEST FRIEND.

06:05.466 --> 06:07.538
YOUR KID IS WEIRD.
(exhales deeply)

06:07.538 --> 06:09.970
WHY WOULD YOU TELL ANDY
TO RUN FOR MAYOR?

06:09.970 --> 06:11.502
'CAUSE I WANT
MY BEACH WEDDING. (chuckles)

06:11.502 --> 06:15.446
PLUS AS A HUMAN BEING,
HE'S... SUPER-LATIVE.

06:15.446 --> 06:17.408
ARE YOU TRYING
TO SAY "SUPERLATIVE"?

06:17.408 --> 06:19.710
HOW CAN I NOT REMEMBER WORDS
FROM TWO DAYS AGO?

06:19.710 --> 06:21.812
I MEAN, THIS THING
DOESN'T WORK.

06:21.812 --> 06:24.084
DO YOU REALIZE
WHAT YOU'VE DONE?

06:24.084 --> 06:25.456
WELL, IF YOU'RE GONNA YELL
AT ME,

06:25.456 --> 06:26.457
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO DO IT
IN THE CAR.

06:26.457 --> 06:28.388
I GOTTA TAKE BACK
TRAVIS' PHONE.

06:28.388 --> 06:30.421
I STOLE IT TO CHANGE
MY CALLER I.D. PHOTO. (chuckles)

06:30.421 --> 06:31.562
(chuckles sarcastically)
SEE?

06:31.562 --> 06:33.494
NEW PHOTO--CUTE SMILE.

06:33.494 --> 06:36.166
OLD PHOTO... SNEEZE FACE.
(chuckles)

06:36.166 --> 06:39.800
I CAN'T BE MARRIED
TO SOMEONE IN PUBLIC OFFICE.

06:39.800 --> 06:43.474
(voice breaking) JULES, I'D HAVE
TO INTERACT WITH PEOPLE.

06:43.474 --> 06:45.806
YOU KNOW I HATE
THE PEOPLE!

06:45.806 --> 06:48.479
THAT'S WHAT YOU GET FOR TELLING
HOLLY OUR THING WAS CANCELED.

06:48.479 --> 06:51.542
YOU KNOW WHAT I HOPE?
THAT THE KARMA GODS GET YOU.

06:51.542 --> 06:55.486
(whispers)
KARMA GODS. OOH. SCARY.

07:00.891 --> 07:02.923
NO.

07:02.923 --> 07:05.425
THANK YOU. (sighs)

07:09.600 --> 07:11.031
HOLLY, GET OUT.

07:11.031 --> 07:12.763
MOM.
NO, IT'S OKAY, TRAV.

07:12.763 --> 07:15.536
THANKS FOR THE ICE CREAM...
(giggles)

07:15.536 --> 07:18.138
AND THE TONGUE PARTY.

07:18.138 --> 07:21.542
(door opens)
OKAY, I WANT TO START BY SAYING
I UNDERSTAND WHY YOU'RE UPSET--

07:21.542 --> 07:23.674
NOT READY TO TALK. OKAY.
(door closes)

07:23.674 --> 07:26.216
I LOVE THE TENSION
IN THIS ROOM.

07:26.216 --> 07:27.518
I JUST WANT TO BAKE IT

07:27.518 --> 07:30.450
INTO A BIG, PUFFY THING
AND EAT IT ALL UP.

07:30.450 --> 07:31.682
SERIOUSLY?

07:31.682 --> 07:33.183
I'M HELPING.

07:33.183 --> 07:36.156
SO IS HOLLY GOING TO SEDUCE
EVERY MAN IN MY LIFE?

07:36.156 --> 07:37.988
OKAY, FIRST OF ALL,
HOLLY DIDN'T SEDUCE ME.

07:37.988 --> 07:39.860
WE JUST--
YOU KNOW WHAT?
TELL ME EVERYTHING.

07:39.860 --> 07:40.861
(sighs)
DID SHE PULL YOUR HAIR?

07:40.861 --> 07:42.963
OHH.
UM, IS SHE A BITER?

07:42.963 --> 07:44.895
OHH.
WHAT DO HER LIPS TASTE LIKE?

07:44.895 --> 07:46.466
(exhales deeply)

07:46.466 --> 07:48.168
CINNAMON.
(whispers) OH.

07:48.168 --> 07:51.171
WELL, I'M DONE WITH CINNAMON.
THERE GOES FRENCH TOAST.

07:51.171 --> 07:52.743
ARE YOU PROUD OF YOURSELF?

07:52.743 --> 07:54.204
HOLLY REALLY ISN'T
THAT BAD.
(door opens)

07:54.204 --> 07:55.676
IF YOU J--

07:55.676 --> 07:59.209
SORRY. I FORGOT SOMETHING.
(chuckles)

07:59.209 --> 08:03.584
YOU ARE TOO QUIET.
(chuckles)

08:03.584 --> 08:06.587
SHE'S A GREAT MOM. (chuckles)
I'LL GIVE YOU THAT.

08:06.587 --> 08:08.118
HEY.

08:08.118 --> 08:09.760
(mouth full) HEY.
I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE

08:09.760 --> 08:11.261
YOU'RE COMING BY
KRAZY KAKES TODAY.

08:11.261 --> 08:12.563
(sighs)

08:12.563 --> 08:16.096
I JUST INVENTED THIS NEW LINE
OF TALKING THREAT CAKES.

08:16.096 --> 08:18.769
OKAY. SAY A CHICK STEALS
YOUR BOYFRIEND.

08:18.769 --> 08:20.270
YOU SEND HER A CAKE,

08:20.270 --> 08:22.873
BUT THEN WHEN SHE OPENS UP
THE LID, IT YELLS...

08:22.873 --> 08:25.105
(gruff voice)
"I'M COMING FOR YOU, BITCH!"

08:25.105 --> 08:26.977
(normal voice) THAT'S CUTE,
RIGHT? (chuckles)

08:26.977 --> 08:28.609
I DON'T REALLY LIKE IT
WHEN MY FOOD TALKS TO ME.

08:28.609 --> 08:30.811
(sighs) THAT'S WHY
I DON'T EAT MONKEYS.

08:30.811 --> 08:31.842
OH.

08:31.842 --> 08:32.843
PLUS
AFTER THAT RACIAL INCIDENT,

08:32.843 --> 08:34.815
I CAN'T SHOW MY FACE
BACK THERE.

08:34.815 --> 08:37.988
SO YOU ACCIDENTALLY SAID
THE WRONG THING.

08:37.988 --> 08:40.050
ONE TIME,
I ASKED THIS BLIND LADY

08:40.050 --> 08:41.692
WHEN HER BABY WAS DUE.

08:41.692 --> 08:44.555
TURNS OUT,
SHE WASN'T PREGNANT...

08:44.555 --> 08:45.295
(exhales deeply)

08:45.295 --> 08:46.957
AND SHE WASN'T EVEN
A LADY,

08:46.957 --> 08:48.929
BUT HE REALLY WAS BLIND,
WHICH WAS GOOD,

08:48.929 --> 08:50.661
BECAUSE WHEN HE WENT TO GO
THROW HIS COFFEE AT ME,

08:50.661 --> 08:53.103
HE TOTALLY MISSED, AND HE HIT
A REAL PREGNANT LADY,

08:53.103 --> 08:55.305
AND I WAS LIKE,
"DUDE, YOU'RE SUCH A JERK!

08:55.305 --> 08:58.108
YOU JUST HIT
A REAL PREGNANT LADY!"

08:58.108 --> 08:59.139
AND THEN IT TURNS OUT

08:59.139 --> 09:01.111
SHE WASN'T PREGNANT
EITHER, SO...

09:01.111 --> 09:02.913
THERE'S A LOT OF FATTIES
IN THIS TOWN.

09:02.913 --> 09:04.575
I KNOW, RIGHT?

09:04.575 --> 09:06.046
WELL... (sighs)

09:06.046 --> 09:08.849
I AM CRAVING
ONE OF YOUR CUPCAKES.
(rubs palms together)

09:08.849 --> 09:10.821
THEY ARE SO ADDICTIVE.

09:10.821 --> 09:12.783
YOU WANNA KNOW
A COMPANY SECRET?

09:12.783 --> 09:15.956
MM-HMM.
A SLIP A LITTLE NICOTINE
INTO THE FROSTING.

09:18.989 --> 09:21.662
ANDY, I KNOW YOU'RE JUST
AROUND THE CORNER

09:21.662 --> 09:23.563
BUILDING THE CONFIDENCE
TO COME ASK ME

09:23.563 --> 09:26.166
IF YOU CAN BE THE MAYOR.

09:26.166 --> 09:29.339
POINT "A"--IT'S SOMETHING
I'D BE REALLY GOOD AT.

09:29.339 --> 09:33.604
"B"--I WANT TO TURN "GULFHAVEN"
INTO "GULF HEAVEN."

09:33.604 --> 09:35.676
HUH?
POSSIBLE CAMPAIGN SLOGAN?

09:35.676 --> 09:40.080
LOOK, WHATEVER YOU DECIDE,
I WON'T BE MAD,

09:40.080 --> 09:43.183
BUT WILL YOU
PLEASE JUST DO ME A FAVOR

09:43.183 --> 09:47.057
AND REALLY THINK
ABOUT IT... FOR ME?

09:47.057 --> 09:51.591
OKAY, SWEETIE. FOR YOU.

09:51.591 --> 09:53.624
THANKS A LOT.
NOW I HAVE TO PRETEND

09:53.624 --> 09:56.927
TO THINK ABOUT
THIS DUMB MAYOR THING ALL DAY.

09:56.927 --> 09:58.598
I GOT MY OWN CRAP
TO DEAL WITH.

09:58.598 --> 10:01.271
DO YOU KNOW THAT IF TRAVIS
AND HOLLY HAD A KID,

10:01.271 --> 10:03.173
MY GRANDDAUGHTER
AND MY STEPDAUGHTER

10:03.173 --> 10:04.604
WOULD BE SISTERS?

10:04.604 --> 10:06.176
THAT PUTS ME IN
THE HILLBILLY HALL OF FAME,

10:06.176 --> 10:07.738
RIGHT NEXT
TO MY COUSIN CHESTNUT,

10:07.738 --> 10:09.810
WHO WAS MURDERED
BY HIS OWN PIGS.

10:09.810 --> 10:12.643
THE PIGS MIGHT HAVE KILLED HIM,
BUT HE WASN'T MURDERED.

10:12.643 --> 10:14.945
"MURDER" IMPLIES FORETHOUGHT.

10:14.945 --> 10:17.087
THEY MURDERED HIM.
THERE MIGHT BE A TRIAL.

10:17.087 --> 10:18.188
WHERE?
OKAY.

10:18.188 --> 10:20.150
THIS SEEMS LIKE
A GOOD STOPPING POINT.

10:20.150 --> 10:22.622
WHY ARE YOU TWO EVEN
UPSET, HMM?

10:22.622 --> 10:24.194
I MEAN, ELLIE,
I ASSUME YOU'RE JUST GOING

10:24.194 --> 10:25.625
TO WAIT A LITTLE WHILE,
THEN CRUSH

10:25.625 --> 10:27.397
YOUR HUSBAND'S SPIRITS,
LIKE USUAL.

10:27.397 --> 10:29.029
CORRECT.
AND, JULES, EVEN THOUGH

10:29.029 --> 10:31.401
I'D LOVE TO KNOW WHY THERE'S
NO MORE CINNAMON IN THE HOUSE...

10:31.401 --> 10:33.203
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT
MY OATMEAL TO TASTE LIKE

10:33.203 --> 10:34.805
A WHORE'S MOUTH.

10:34.805 --> 10:36.406
PFFT!
FAIR ENOUGH.

10:36.406 --> 10:38.238
YOU MADE IT VERY CLEAR
TO TRAVIS...
(door closes)

10:38.238 --> 10:40.711
THAT YOU DON'T WANT HIM
SEEING HOLLY, SO IT'S OVER.

10:41.772 --> 10:43.273
HEY, MOM.

10:43.273 --> 10:46.276
I THINK I'M FALLING FOR HOLLY.

10:46.276 --> 10:47.277
(gasps)

10:47.277 --> 10:48.418
(sighs)
HOW DELISH.

10:48.418 --> 10:52.022
NO, NO, NO. ELLIE, YOU GO.
GRAYSON, STAY.

10:52.022 --> 10:54.424
OHH.
OH, MAN.

10:54.424 --> 10:55.926
(grunts)

10:59.990 --> 11:01.661
(Laurie sighs)
(Bobby, lowered voice)
OH, MAN.

11:01.661 --> 11:03.063
(lowered voice)
NO, IT'S OKAY. I CALLED HIM.

11:03.063 --> 11:05.295
(normal voice) HI, MR. KOH.
YOUR CAKE IS READY,

11:05.295 --> 11:10.170
AND... BOBBY HERE
ACTUALLY PAID FOR IT.

11:10.170 --> 11:12.042
I DID?
YOU DID BECAUSE YOU FELT

11:12.042 --> 11:14.104
SO BAD FOR OFFENDING HIM.

11:14.104 --> 11:18.108
YEP. WHAT SHE SAYS.
I'M SORRY.

11:18.108 --> 11:19.850
I ACCEPT YOUR APOLOGY.

11:19.850 --> 11:22.783
(chuckles)

11:22.783 --> 11:24.785
(deep voice) FORGIVEN!
(normal voice) SEE?

11:24.785 --> 11:28.919
BOBBY, YOU FACED IT,
AND IT'S OVER.

11:28.919 --> 11:30.761
IT'S NOT. I MEAN,
I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING,

11:30.761 --> 11:33.764
BUT MY MIND KEPT THINKING
BAD THINGS, LIKE...

11:33.764 --> 11:34.765
(lowered voice)
THAT DUDE OVER THERE--

11:34.765 --> 11:35.966
I'M WONDERING IF HE CAN DUNK.

11:35.966 --> 11:37.928
(sighs) YOU'RE BEING
TOO HARD ON YOURSELF.

11:37.928 --> 11:39.970
(clatters)

11:39.970 --> 11:41.071
BOBBY?

11:41.071 --> 11:42.232
CAN YOU DUNK?

11:42.232 --> 11:43.373
I CAN.

11:43.373 --> 11:45.876
OH, YEAH! (chuckles)
THAT'S SO AWESOME!

11:50.440 --> 11:53.744
ANDY... (sighs)
LOOK, I'VE THOUGHT ABOUT

11:53.744 --> 11:56.216
THIS MAYOR THING ALL DAY,
AND I-I'M SORRY.

11:56.216 --> 12:00.090
IT'S JUST NOT SOMETHING
I FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH.

12:00.090 --> 12:01.721
ARE YOU OKAY?

12:01.721 --> 12:03.453
YEAH, I SAID
I WOULDN'T BE MAD.

12:03.453 --> 12:05.195
THANKS, BOO.
(engine revving)

12:05.195 --> 12:07.097
ARE YOU SPEEDING UP?

12:09.059 --> 12:12.903
OOH. I FORGOT
THAT SPEED BUMP WAS THERE.

12:12.903 --> 12:15.505
REALLY?

12:15.505 --> 12:18.338
(sighs) THERE'S JUST SOMETHING
SO INNOCENT ABOUT HOLLY.

12:18.338 --> 12:20.740
I JUST WANT TO...
(inhales deeply and grunts)

12:20.740 --> 12:21.872
PROTECT HER.

12:21.872 --> 12:23.743
PLUS JILL COULD REALLY USE
A FATHER.

12:23.743 --> 12:26.216
SHE HAS A FATHER.
I MEANT A GOOD ONE.

12:26.216 --> 12:29.219
(pants) IT'S LIKE MY LIFE
IS FLASHING BEFORE MY EYES.

12:29.219 --> 12:31.481
I SHOULD HAVE DRANK
MORE WINE.

12:31.481 --> 12:32.923
LUCKILY MY PLACE HAS ROOM
FOR A CRIB.

12:32.923 --> 12:34.284
BED'S TINY,
BUT, UH, HOLLY LIKES

12:34.284 --> 12:37.757
TO SLEEP RIGHT ON TOP OF YOU,
STARING INTO YOUR EYES.

12:37.757 --> 12:38.859
DON'T WORRY, MOM.

12:38.859 --> 12:39.890
(clenches teeth) SHE SAYS
SHE'S ON THE PILL...

12:39.890 --> 12:41.061
(whispers) YEAH!

12:41.061 --> 12:43.193
AND I'M TOTALLY MESSING
WITH YOU.

12:43.193 --> 12:44.935
WHY?

12:44.935 --> 12:48.168
BECAUSE YOU TREAT HOLLY
LIKE CRAP. WE ALL DO.

12:48.168 --> 12:49.800
SHE DIDN'T SEDUCE ME.

12:49.800 --> 12:51.371
I JUST SAW
A HOT, VULNERABLE GIRL,

12:51.371 --> 12:53.003
AND I TOOK ADVANTAGE
OF HER.

12:53.003 --> 12:54.805
I THOUGHT YOU WERE BETTER
THAN THAT.

12:54.805 --> 12:55.505
NO.

12:55.505 --> 12:59.179
(chuckling)
PLAYERS GOTTA PLAY.

12:59.179 --> 13:00.881
THAT WAS A HABIT.

13:00.881 --> 13:02.182
I'M GONNA TAKE
THAT HIGH FIVE BACK.

13:02.182 --> 13:04.815
(imitates videotape rewinding)

13:04.815 --> 13:06.186
I KNOW YOU DON'T WANT
TO DEAL WITH HOLLY,

13:06.186 --> 13:08.088
BUT YOU CAN'T BOX HER
OUT OF YOUR LIFE.

13:08.088 --> 13:10.290
HMM. (grunts)

13:10.290 --> 13:12.893
THAT'S FOR BRINGING
THIS GIRL INTO OUR LIFE.

13:12.893 --> 13:14.895
IT'S OKAY.
I'M STILL GONNA WEAR IT.

13:14.895 --> 13:17.327
BESIDES, TRAV HAS A POINT.

13:17.327 --> 13:18.869
YOU REALLY WANT
TO GO THERE?

13:18.869 --> 13:22.172
(imitating announcer) UH-OH.
HE'S ALWAYS BACKED DOWN

13:22.172 --> 13:25.105
WHEN IT COMES TO DEFENDING
HIS BABY MAMA,

13:25.105 --> 13:27.277
BUT NOW HE JUST MIGHT TAKE
A STAND.

13:28.909 --> 13:31.341
HIGH FIVE REINSTATED.

13:31.341 --> 13:32.943
YEAH. YOU WON'T EVEN GIVE
HOLLY A CHANCE,

13:32.943 --> 13:34.814
AND THAT IS NOT LIKE YOU.

13:34.814 --> 13:38.448
IF YOU NEED US--TEAM HOLLY--
WE'LL BE AT MY PLACE.

13:38.448 --> 13:40.420
I DON'T CARE. LEAVE.
(exhales deeply)

13:40.420 --> 13:43.493
YOU'RE BOTH BEING TOTALLY...
MAGNANIMOUS!

13:43.493 --> 13:45.355
NOT A BAD THING.
IT MEANS WE'RE AWESOME.

13:45.355 --> 13:47.557
(door closes)
STUPID CALENDAR!

13:53.103 --> 13:54.204
YOU KNOW
WHEN YOU'RE KISSING HOLLY

13:54.204 --> 13:55.335
AND SHE PUSHES HER GUM
INTO YOUR MOUTH

13:55.335 --> 13:57.467
AND THEN SUCKS IT BACK OUT
INTO HERS?

13:57.467 --> 13:59.309
WHY IS THAT SO HOT?

13:59.309 --> 14:01.471
PROBABLY HER BIG BOOBS.

14:01.471 --> 14:03.944
PROBABLY.

14:03.944 --> 14:06.576
IN CASE
YOU TWO ARE WONDERING,

14:06.576 --> 14:09.179
THIS IS
MY PERSONAL NIGHTMARE.

14:09.179 --> 14:11.451
HERE YOU GO, LITTLE GUY.

14:11.451 --> 14:12.983
(whispers) GREAT.

14:12.983 --> 14:16.626
AS MAYOR,
I DUB THIS POTHOLE FILLED.

14:16.626 --> 14:18.328
THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

14:18.328 --> 14:21.331
OF COURSE YOU MAY HAVE
MY AUTOGRAPH, MS. LATIFAH.

14:21.331 --> 14:24.494
(chuckles) HERE. "HIS HONOR--"

14:24.494 --> 14:27.167
QUEEN LATIFAH COMES
TO VISIT?

14:27.167 --> 14:30.941
NO, SHE'S MY TRUSTED ADVISOR.
SHE HELPS ME KEEP IT REAL.

14:30.941 --> 14:34.104
I'M REALLY SORRY ABOUT
ALL OF THIS MAYOR STUFF.

14:34.104 --> 14:36.046
IT'S STUPID.

14:36.046 --> 14:38.048
I'LL CLEAN THIS UP.

14:40.510 --> 14:43.583
(squeaks and thuds)

14:43.583 --> 14:46.486
WELL, THAT'S MUCH WORSE.

14:46.486 --> 14:48.288
I'LL GET A TOWEL.

14:48.288 --> 14:50.360
(mouths word)

14:50.360 --> 14:53.123
I'VE PUT TOGETHER A PANEL
OF OUR MINORITY FRIENDS

14:53.123 --> 14:55.095
TO GET YOU THROUGH THIS.

14:55.095 --> 14:57.297
TODAY WE'RE GONNA FIX RACISM,

14:57.297 --> 14:59.429
HOPEFULLY,
BEFORE OUR BURGERS COME.

14:59.429 --> 15:00.600
I CAN'T STAY LONG.

15:00.600 --> 15:02.332
I HAVE AN ENGINEERING PAPER
DUE TOMORROW.

15:02.332 --> 15:04.034
WAY TO FIGHT
THE STEREOTYPE THERE, DUDE.
(keys clacking, computer beeps)

15:04.034 --> 15:08.078
AND EVERYONE SAY HI TO WADE,
MY TWITTER BOYFRIEND,

15:08.078 --> 15:11.141
COMING TO US LIVE FROM...
(whispers) AFGHANISTAN.

15:11.141 --> 15:13.213
Hey, girl. (chuckles)

15:13.213 --> 15:14.544
Why aren't you naked?

15:14.544 --> 15:15.946
OH. (lowered voice) UM...

15:15.946 --> 15:18.648
SO WE KIND OF HAVE SKYPE SEX
ALL THE TIME.

15:18.648 --> 15:20.920
I'VE ACTUALLY SAT
ON THAT SCREEN.

15:20.920 --> 15:22.622
IT'S REALLY STRONG.

15:22.622 --> 15:24.124
(normal voice) SORRY.

15:24.124 --> 15:25.295
INSTEAD, I NEED YOU
TO HELP CONVINCE

15:25.295 --> 15:28.528
A TOTAL STRANGER
THAT HE'S NOT PREJUDICED.

15:28.528 --> 15:30.400
Yeah, that's fantastic.

15:30.400 --> 15:32.562
WHY IS ANDY
ON THE MINORITY COUNCIL?

15:32.562 --> 15:33.563
I'M LATINO.

15:33.563 --> 15:35.605
(laughs)

15:35.605 --> 15:36.536
OH, I'M SORRY. NO.

15:36.536 --> 15:39.109
IT'S JUST ALWAYS FUNNY
WHEN YOU SAY IT.

15:39.109 --> 15:41.711
WELL, YOU SHOULDN'T BE LAUGHING
AT OTHER PEOPLE'S HERITAGE.

15:41.711 --> 15:43.343
(chuckling)
I MEAN, LISTEN TO ME.

15:43.343 --> 15:46.946
IT'S LIKE THE POT CALLING
THE KETTLE BLA--

15:46.946 --> 15:48.448
AFRICAN-AMERICAN.

15:48.448 --> 15:50.350
Seriously?

15:50.350 --> 15:52.252
I GET THAT
YOU TWO FEEL GUILTY.

15:52.252 --> 15:55.225
YOU SHOULD. YOU BOTH THINK
WITH YOUR... DANGLIES.

15:55.225 --> 15:56.356
YEP.
GUILTY.

15:56.356 --> 15:58.628
OH. FEEL FREE
TO JUST LET YOURSELF IN

15:58.628 --> 15:59.990
AND DRINK MY WINE.

15:59.990 --> 16:01.661
(clinks)
IT'S MY SECOND BOTTLE.

16:01.661 --> 16:03.663
HOW ARE YOU STILL
SPEAKING CLEARLY?

16:03.663 --> 16:05.095
IT'S ONLY WHITE.

16:05.095 --> 16:07.167
LOOK, HOLLY JUST WANTS
TO BE YOUR FRIEND.

16:07.167 --> 16:09.199
(chuckles) SHE'S THE MOTHER
OF YOUR CHILD.

16:09.199 --> 16:10.570
YOU SHOULD BOND WITH HER.

16:10.570 --> 16:13.503
YOU KNOW WHAT I LEARNED
FROM MY FRIENDSHIP WITH ELLIE?

16:13.503 --> 16:15.175
THERE'S NO SUCH THING
AS TOO MEAN.

16:15.175 --> 16:16.746
NEVER LET YOUR FRIENDS KNOW
FOR SURE IF YOU LIKE THEM?

16:16.746 --> 16:18.678
ALWAYS HOLD A GRUDGE?
REALLY?

16:18.678 --> 16:20.550
SORRY.
I WANTED TO DO ONE, TOO.

16:20.550 --> 16:22.112
SOMETIMES IT'S OKAY

16:22.112 --> 16:24.214
TO OCCASIONALLY PUT
YOURSELF FIRST.

16:24.214 --> 16:26.456
I MEAN, I-IT'S LIKE THAT THING
WITH ANDY BEING MAYOR.

16:26.456 --> 16:28.118
SHE KNOWS IT WOULD MAKE
HER MISERABLE,

16:28.118 --> 16:29.589
SO SHE SAID NO.

16:29.589 --> 16:32.562
I MEAN, SOMETIMES
IT'S OKAY TO BE SELFISH,

16:32.562 --> 16:33.663
RIGHT, ELLIE?

16:33.663 --> 16:36.396
IT'S NOT.

16:36.396 --> 16:39.699
SERIOUSLY? NOW'S THE TIME
YOU DECIDE TO BE HUMAN?

16:41.401 --> 16:42.632
COME ON.
I WANT TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING.

16:46.076 --> 16:48.708
LOOK, YOU HAVE
THIS CRAZY BLIND SPOT

16:48.708 --> 16:50.080
FOR ALL OUR FAULTS,

16:50.080 --> 16:52.282
LIKE, UH, YOU KNOW,
GRAYSON'S VANITY

16:52.282 --> 16:54.784
AND DAD'S CHILDISHNESS.

16:54.784 --> 16:56.186
YOUR GREASY HAIR.

16:56.186 --> 16:59.789
I SAID "BLIND SPOT."
MEANS YOU DON'T SEE IT.

16:59.789 --> 17:04.094
I JUST WISH YOU COULD STOP
SEEING HOLLY FOR HER FAULTS

17:04.094 --> 17:08.298
AND SEE HER
FOR WHAT SHE REALLY IS--

17:08.298 --> 17:10.060
A YOUNG MOM...

17:10.060 --> 17:12.662
(both speaking indistinctly)
WHO FEELS LIKE
SHE'S IN WAY OVER HER HEAD.

17:12.662 --> 17:15.165
I MEAN, THAT WAS YOU ONCE.

17:16.666 --> 17:19.169
THAT WAS REALLY HARD.

17:19.169 --> 17:22.041
YEAH, WELL, NOW YOU KNOW.

17:22.041 --> 17:23.643
AND YOU ARE REALLY SMUG.

17:23.643 --> 17:24.644
(chuckles)

17:24.644 --> 17:26.176
I'M NOT BLIND
TO THAT EITHER.

17:26.176 --> 17:28.718
DON'T HATE.

17:28.718 --> 17:30.120
AND EVERY TIME I OPEN
MY MOUTH,

17:30.120 --> 17:32.722
I'M AFRAID I'M JUST GONNA
OFFEND SOMEONE.

17:32.722 --> 17:33.823
YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES I THINK
IT WOULD JUST BE EASIER

17:33.823 --> 17:36.686
IF WE ALL SEPARATED
INTO OUR OWN GROUPS, YOU KNOW,

17:36.686 --> 17:39.659
LIKE, BLACKS WITH BLACKS,
WHITES WITH WHITES.

17:39.659 --> 17:41.531
THEY TRIED THAT IN SOUTH AFRICA.

17:41.531 --> 17:43.233
YEAH, AND THANK GOD
BONO FIXED IT.

17:43.233 --> 17:44.334
ALL RIGHT. LET'S JUST SAY
WE'RE PICKING TEAMS

17:44.334 --> 17:45.765
TO PLAY BASKETBALL.

17:45.765 --> 17:47.837
NOW, WADE, WOULD YOU BE OFFENDED
IF I PICKED YOU FIRST,

17:47.837 --> 17:50.840
EVEN THOUGH ALL I KNOW ABOUT YOU
IS THAT YOU'RE BLACK?

17:50.840 --> 17:52.502
Hell, yeah, man.
That's messed up.

17:52.502 --> 17:53.743
SO I SHOULDN'T PICK YOU.

17:53.743 --> 17:55.505
Of course you should, man.
I can dunk.

17:55.505 --> 17:56.646
I KNEW IT!

17:56.646 --> 17:57.777
AND AS A LATINO...

17:57.777 --> 17:59.709
(Laurie, Sig, and Bobby laugh)

17:59.709 --> 18:01.481
REALLY?
NOW WE'RE ALL LAUGHING?

18:01.481 --> 18:02.782
WHY IS IT OKAY
TO LAUGH AT HIM?

18:02.782 --> 18:05.285
I MEAN, THIS IS ALL SUCH--
SUCH A MOVING TARGET, MAN.

18:05.285 --> 18:06.686
I CAN'T HANDLE IT.

18:06.686 --> 18:08.418
LOOK, BUDDY, THE FACT
THAT YOU'RE AGONIZING SO MUCH

18:08.418 --> 18:11.621
OVER THIS MEANS
YOU'RE A BETTER MAN THAN MOST.

18:11.621 --> 18:15.094
OH, THANKS, MAN.

18:15.094 --> 18:17.227
OH, MY GOD.

18:17.227 --> 18:19.199
MY RACE PANEL WORKED.

18:19.199 --> 18:20.830
IF THERE IS ONE THING
THAT WE'VE LEARNED

18:20.830 --> 18:23.473
FROM MICHELLE PFEIFFER
IN "DANGEROUS MINDS"

18:23.473 --> 18:25.375
OR SANDY BULLOCK
IN "THE BLIND SIDE"

18:25.375 --> 18:27.877
OR HILARY SWANK
IN THAT MOVIE NO ONE EVER SAW,

18:27.877 --> 18:31.381
IT'S THAT ALL YOU NEED
TO FIX MINORITY PROBLEMS

18:31.381 --> 18:33.413
IS A REALLY PRETTY WHITE WOMAN.

18:39.419 --> 18:41.191
SO YOU WANT TO BE MAYOR?

18:41.191 --> 18:43.823
(thud)
GO FOR IT.

18:47.857 --> 18:49.829
THIS IS SO AWESOME!

18:51.261 --> 18:52.732
YOU KNOW WHY YOU'RE GREAT?

18:52.732 --> 18:55.765
YES, BUT TELL ME ANYWAY.

18:55.765 --> 18:57.767
YOU TRY TO HIDE IT,

18:57.767 --> 19:00.870
BUT YOU REALLY DO CARE
ABOUT WHAT MAKES ME HAPPY.

19:00.870 --> 19:02.442
OKAY.

19:05.845 --> 19:06.816
(paper rustles)

19:06.816 --> 19:08.818
HERE'S WHAT I WANT
AS FIRST LADY.

19:08.818 --> 19:11.321
"I GET TO PARK
WHEREVER I WANT.

19:11.321 --> 19:13.423
"OUR TOWN SHOULD BE
LESS DOG-FRIENDLY.

19:13.423 --> 19:15.425
"NO CAR ALARMS.
NO ROLLERBLADERS.

19:15.425 --> 19:16.826
"NO STREET PERFORMERS.

19:16.826 --> 19:20.190
NO MORE WOODEN LAWN BIRDS
THAT DO THIS."

19:20.190 --> 19:21.861
(mouths words)
"NO CARNIVALS.

19:21.861 --> 19:24.694
"NO 5Ks. NO 10Ks. NO K's.

19:24.694 --> 19:27.267
NO HAIR SALONS
WITH NAMES THAT ARE PUNS."

19:27.267 --> 19:30.440
THE HAIRPORT. WE GET IT.
IT'S NEAR THE AIRPORT.

19:30.440 --> 19:32.702
"NO PUBLIC COUGHING.
NO CIRCUMCISIONS.

19:32.702 --> 19:34.844
"NO PIERCED EARS ON BABIES.

19:34.844 --> 19:36.406
"NO ADULTS WHO SKATEBOARD.

19:36.406 --> 19:37.877
"NO TANK TOPS.
NO TUBE TOPS.

19:37.877 --> 19:40.580
NO SHORT SHORTS,
AND NO STUPID PEOPLE."

19:40.580 --> 19:41.911
THEN MY PEN RAN OUT.

19:41.911 --> 19:43.453
UH, YEAH, AND DON'T FORGET,

19:43.453 --> 19:45.615
YOU WANT ME TO LET JULES HAVE
HER WEDDING ON THE BEACH.

19:45.615 --> 19:47.817
OH, I DON'T CARE
ABOUT THAT.

19:47.817 --> 19:49.519
JULES?

19:49.519 --> 19:52.322
I LET GRAYSON TAKE TAMPA
FOR ICE CREAM,

19:52.322 --> 19:54.364
AND I SAID I'D MEET HIM
HERE AFTER,

19:54.364 --> 19:57.567
SO I'LL JUST WAIT OUT HERE
TILL THEY GET BACK.

19:57.567 --> 20:01.200
IT'S OKAY, HOLLY. COME IN.

20:01.200 --> 20:03.833
(thuds)

20:03.833 --> 20:04.804
PUSH.

20:04.804 --> 20:08.878
WHOA. THANKS. WEIRD DOOR.

20:08.878 --> 20:10.209
NOT REALLY.

20:10.209 --> 20:13.713
SO HOW ABOUT SOME TEQUILA
AND GIRL TALK? (chuckles)

20:13.713 --> 20:15.315
NO.

20:15.315 --> 20:16.686
в™Єв™Єв™Є

20:16.686 --> 20:19.719
YOU KNOW, IF YOU'RE GONNA BE
A PART OF THIS FAMILY,

20:19.719 --> 20:21.691
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO LEARN
TO LOVE WINE.

20:21.691 --> 20:23.393
(chuckles) FAMILY?
(pours wine)

20:23.393 --> 20:25.224
(giggles) OH, MY GOD.

20:25.224 --> 20:27.427
I TOTALLY FEEL LIKE
HUGGING YOU RIGHT NOW.

20:27.427 --> 20:29.899
ALL RIGHT. BRING IT.

20:29.899 --> 20:31.861
MM.

20:31.861 --> 20:33.933
YOU HUG JUST LIKE YOUR SON.

20:33.933 --> 20:35.565
ALL RIGHT. DON'T RUIN IT.

20:35.565 --> 20:38.968
(giggles)
(chuckles)

20:38.968 --> 20:40.340
в™Єв™Єв™Є

20:40.340 --> 20:43.413
MMM. THIS TASTES LIKE
SPICY, RED VODKA.

20:43.413 --> 20:44.644
OH, YOU ARE GONNA LOVE
THIS STUFF.

20:44.644 --> 20:46.516
(chuckles) OH, MY GOD.
(chuckles)

20:49.879 --> 20:50.780
NOW LET'S POP A LITTLE WINE

20:50.780 --> 20:53.323
AND TALK ABOUT
THE SUPPOSED PIG TRIAL, HMM?

20:53.323 --> 20:56.786
I GOT 9,000 QUESTIONS.
DO THEY USE HANDCUFFS?

20:56.786 --> 20:59.028
THEY USE ROPE.
JURY OF THEIR PEERS?

20:59.028 --> 21:00.790
MAYBE.
LAWYERS?

21:00.790 --> 21:02.462
HUMANS.
BAILIFFS?

21:02.462 --> 21:04.894
HORSES.
HOW DO THEY GET THE PIG
ON THE WITNESS STAND?

21:04.894 --> 21:07.567
PIG RAMP.
DO THEY UNDERSTAND
WHAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING?

21:07.567 --> 21:08.798
THEY HAVE INTERPRETERS.

21:08.798 --> 21:10.039
IS THE JURY EVER FED HAM?

21:10.039 --> 21:11.801
NOT IF THEY'RE KOSHER.

21:11.801 --> 21:13.703
WHAT'S THE MAXIMUM SENTENCE?

21:13.703 --> 21:14.804
BACON.

21:14.804 --> 21:15.875
IS THERE
A PIG TRAFFIC COURT?

21:15.875 --> 21:17.547
WELL, I'VE HEARD OF IT.
I'VE NEVER SEEN IT.

21:17.547 --> 21:19.849
HOW DO THEY GET THE PIG
TO STOP SQUEALING?
GAVEL.

21:19.849 --> 21:21.951
WHAT IF A PIG CALLS
A COP A "PIG"?

21:21.951 --> 21:23.983
(chuckles) THAT'S FUNNY.
THAT'S FUNNY. PEOPLE LAUGH.

21:23.983 --> 21:25.785
DO THE PIGS WEAR
PRISON JUMPSUITS?

21:25.785 --> 21:28.418
NO, BOW TIES, AND IT'S
REALLY ADORABLE. (chuckles)

21:28.418 --> 21:29.919
(laughs)
