24:14.249 --> 24:15.458
Are we in trouble?

24:15.541 --> 24:17.458
Do you know
who killed your brother?

24:17.541 --> 24:20.041
(YELLS) What the fuck
is going on, Vince?

24:20.124 --> 24:21.875
VINCENT: Like you care.

24:21.958 --> 24:24.917
I mean, you haven't been here
since he died.

24:24.999 --> 24:27.333
I mean, wh-- where the fuck
you been for me?

24:27.416 --> 24:29.375
Where have I been for you?

24:30.416 --> 24:32.625
Are you fucking kidding me?

24:32.708 --> 24:35.291
-You're not here, Abby.
-ABBY: Oh, my God.

24:35.375 --> 24:38.249
I need you, you--
you're down at the bar.

24:38.333 --> 24:40.792
You're off with Pilar
of whatever fuckhole

24:40.875 --> 24:43.458
wants to make an art project
outta piss

24:43.541 --> 24:44.917
and fucking street trash?

24:44.999 --> 24:48.166
This fucking cause,
this fucking meeting.

24:49.041 --> 24:50.667
I'm right here, Abby!

24:51.500 --> 24:53.875
I've been here, waitin'.

24:53.958 --> 24:56.541
-Where the fuck did you go?
-Answer me.

24:57.958 --> 24:59.375
Why do you need a gun?

25:04.083 --> 25:05.124
Fuck this!

25:09.083 --> 25:10.833
Calm down. Calm down.

25:10.917 --> 25:12.333
Okay, calm down.

25:12.416 --> 25:14.416
Your brother is shot to death,
nobody knows why,

25:14.500 --> 25:17.208
you have a fucking gun?
And you expect me to calm down?

25:17.958 --> 25:19.041
Abby.

25:21.208 --> 25:23.124
Abby. Abby!

25:25.750 --> 25:26.792
You promised.

(DOOR OPENS, SLAMS)

25:32.166 --> 25:35.083
Your fucking spontaneous side?
Come here. Come here.

25:35.166 --> 25:36.833
Do not blame your fucking AC

25:36.917 --> 25:40.333

in fr-- This is not a practical!

25:40.416 --> 25:41.958
Huh? Look this shadow!
Look at me!

25:42.041 --> 25:43.291
Who is this? A ghost?

25:43.375 --> 25:45.208
What am I, the-- the specter
of Jacob Marley

25:45.291 --> 25:46.750
come back from the dead
to tell this whore

25:46.833 --> 25:48.708
-to repent for her sins?
-I saw something, I went for it.

25:48.792 --> 25:50.541
-It could've worked. I'm sorry.
-Nah, bullshit.

25:50.625 --> 25:52.208
Here we go. Look, in our midst.

25:52.291 --> 25:53.625
Huh? In our midst,

25:53.708 --> 25:56.249
a director who knows how
to set a fucking light. Huh?

25:56.333 --> 25:58.667
Look, everybody,
it's the legendary Candy Renee

25:58.750 --> 26:00.333
gracing our humble, uh-- uh--

26:00.416 --> 26:01.958
-little flesh pit here.
-Harvey, shut the fuck up.

26:02.041 --> 26:03.291
Here, here. Come. Stuart.

26:03.375 --> 26:05.249
Gaze upon a director
who shows up to work

26:05.333 --> 26:07.541
with a shot list
and sticks to it. Okay?

26:07.625 --> 26:10.249
Come-- Come touch
the fucking hem of her garment.

26:10.333 --> 26:12.999
All right? So that you can hope
against hope that maybe

26:13.083 --> 26:15.667
some shards of competence
and professionalism

26:15.750 --> 26:17.291

-Don't rattle.

26:17.375 --> 26:18.833
-...to gather unto yourself.
-He talked to me like this

26:18.917 --> 26:20.541
the first five years
we worked together.

26:20.625 --> 26:23.708
-Three years, maybe.
-Can I talk to you?

26:23.792 --> 26:25.291
Yeah. Sure.

26:26.833 --> 26:30.041
Dopey, talk to Eddie. Okay?
Figure out your next move.

26:30.124 --> 26:32.416
Video isn't film,
but it still costs money.

26:32.500 --> 26:33.917
GREG TAYLOR: Market's saturated

26:33.999 --> 26:35.583
since everyone can just
take home their favorites.

26:35.667 --> 26:37.708
People are only gonna watch
so many movies. (SNIFFS)

26:37.792 --> 26:39.249
Distribution's
how you make money.

26:39.333 --> 26:41.875
Mark at Cal Vista was saying
a single retailer

26:41.958 --> 26:44.500
used to buy 20 copies
of a title.

26:44.583 --> 26:46.291
You were at a meeting
with Cal Vista?

26:46.375 --> 26:47.833
GREG: Yeah, we had drinks.

26:48.875 --> 26:50.583
What'd he say?

26:50.667 --> 26:52.333
Production's a money pit.

26:52.416 --> 26:54.166
Too many new releases
flooding the market.

26:54.249 --> 26:55.792
What does that mean?

26:55.875 --> 26:57.667
Greg, when you started
this company,

26:57.750 --> 26:59.208
you said that you had a plan.

26:59.291 --> 27:01.500
I do have a plan, but for now...

27:01.583 --> 27:03.999
it's to break even. (SIGHS)

27:05.667 --> 27:06.999
Where should we go for dinner?

27:07.083 --> 27:08.958
I have a shoot tomorrow.

27:09.041 --> 27:10.625
So, what is the plan?

27:10.708 --> 27:13.249
The plan is for you to be
Lori Madison

27:13.333 --> 27:15.291
like no one else can be
Lori Madison.

27:15.375 --> 27:18.124
Tour was good money,
but was talking to Kiki

27:18.208 --> 27:19.667
and she made it clear

27:19.750 --> 27:21.375
that now you need to get back
on the horse and ride.

27:21.458 --> 27:23.750
Go big. Show people
what they haven't seen before.

27:23.833 --> 27:25.958
What the fuck haven't they seen
before?

27:26.041 --> 27:27.333
(SNIFFS)

27:27.416 --> 27:31.375
Okay, maybe we should buy back
some of my titles

27:31.458 --> 27:33.625
and then we could start
a mail order business

27:33.708 --> 27:35.166
where we sell, like,
signed boxes

27:35.249 --> 27:37.792
and slicks and magazines
and stuff like that.

27:37.875 --> 27:39.750
Do you think we have
enough money left to do that?

27:41.375 --> 27:42.833
(PHONE RINGING)

27:46.999 --> 27:49.625
I saw something the other night.

27:49.708 --> 27:51.458
HARVEY: What'd you see?

27:51.541 --> 27:53.041
It was a waitress.

27:53.124 --> 27:55.625
No, you know,
it doesn't fucking matter.

27:55.708 --> 27:59.208
I saw a moment
and I realized that...

27:59.291 --> 28:02.166
all my talking to the girls,
everything I saw in the street,

28:02.249 --> 28:04.124
you know, I was trying to pull
that through the keyhole.

28:04.208 --> 28:06.833
I was gonna tell people
about a life they can't know.

28:06.917 --> 28:09.208
Right? I was going to tell them
my little truth.

28:09.291 --> 28:11.416
That was my big idea.
That was my movie.

28:12.083 --> 28:13.416
Okay.

28:13.500 --> 28:16.583
-So, what?
-So, it's not my truth.

28:17.875 --> 28:20.917
It's the whole fucking world.

28:20.999 --> 28:24.166
This is how we learn to live.

28:24.249 --> 28:26.875
What we trade,
what we give away,

28:26.958 --> 28:30.166
you know, what the fucking price
of everything is.

28:30.249 --> 28:32.708
The price of wh-- What is
the price of everything?

28:32.792 --> 28:35.375
Okay, look. I used to fuck guys
for 30 dollars.

28:35.458 --> 28:36.958
And I was selling it short.

28:37.041 --> 28:39.958
But every woman in this world,
she's selling shit.

28:40.041 --> 28:41.416
Even if she doesn't wanna be.

28:41.500 --> 28:43.875
She's still got a price tag
on her somewhere.

28:43.958 --> 28:45.667
Every one of us.

28:45.750 --> 28:47.875
Well, that's pretty
fucking cynical.

28:47.958 --> 28:50.500
-CANDY: Oh, it is?
-I mean, yeah, even for me.

28:50.583 --> 28:51.999
This is your world.

28:52.083 --> 28:55.249
You guys made this motherfucker.

28:56.792 --> 28:59.541
Harvey, come on.

28:59.625 --> 29:03.249
How do we end damn near
every fuck scene on camera?

29:03.333 --> 29:07.416
We have the guy pull his dick
out and cum on a woman's face,

29:07.500 --> 29:09.291
and we call it the money shot.

29:09.375 --> 29:11.208
I mean, who makes love

29:11.291 --> 29:13.667
and finishes that way
every damn time?

29:13.750 --> 29:15.083
Or I should say, who,

29:15.166 --> 29:17.833
before we made the dirty movies
to teach them how?

29:19.917 --> 29:21.333
But what men want...

29:22.500 --> 29:24.750
No, what they'll pay for...

29:24.833 --> 29:26.708
that becomes the world.

29:28.208 --> 29:30.833
And we're all whores from this.

29:31.999 --> 29:33.500
(SCOFFS)

29:36.541 --> 29:39.333
All right,
so what is this movie...

29:39.958 --> 29:40.999
a-- about?

29:41.917 --> 29:43.166
(CHUCKLES)

29:43.249 --> 29:45.375
Yeah, well, it's not gonna be
about the life.

29:45.458 --> 29:48.541
You know, that was me making it
just about me.

29:50.291 --> 29:52.416
And that was me...

29:52.500 --> 29:55.291
giving an audience something
to gawk at and say,

29:55.375 --> 29:56.958
"Hey, look at those
fucked up bitches.

29:57.041 --> 29:58.625
They're doing
what good people don't."

29:58.708 --> 30:00.583
I mean, that was me letting
everybody off the hook.

30:00.667 --> 30:04.875
No, it's just gonna be
about a woman in this world.

30:04.958 --> 30:06.833
You know,
she could be a waitress.

30:07.667 --> 30:08.917
(SCOFFS)

30:08.999 --> 30:10.458
She could be a secretary,
doesn't fucking matter.

30:10.541 --> 30:13.999
But everything she does,
everywhere she goes...

30:14.083 --> 30:16.875
she's got a price tag
hanging on her ass.

30:16.958 --> 30:19.375
Are people still fucking
in this movie?

30:19.458 --> 30:20.792
Yeah, of course,
they're fucking.

30:20.875 --> 30:23.541
There's no getting around
the fact that they fuck.

30:24.625 --> 30:27.999
(GROANS)
I'll you what, Miss Merrell.

30:33.750 --> 30:35.249
I'll give you 20 grand.

30:35.333 --> 30:38.083
I'll skin it off the next five
straight-to-videos,

30:38.166 --> 30:39.375
but you gotta match it

30:39.458 --> 30:41.917
with another 20
from somewhere else. How's that?

30:46.500 --> 30:48.667
CHRIS ALSTON: Goldman has some
pull with the Marriott people,

30:48.750 --> 30:51.500
-but I can't guarantee--
-HADDIX: Can't guarantee?

30:51.583 --> 30:55.750
-Now, did I say that to you?
-CHRIS: No. No, you didn't.

30:56.375 --> 30:57.958
One other thing.

30:58.041 --> 31:01.583
It feels like the best days
of public morals are behind us.

31:01.667 --> 31:04.541
Frankly, Lieutenant Alston,
I'm beginning to believe

31:04.625 --> 31:06.833
that you and Goldman
and all the do-gooders

31:06.917 --> 31:09.083
are actually gonna clean up
enough of this shithole

31:09.166 --> 31:11.124
so the Deuce doesn't pay
like it used to.

31:12.583 --> 31:14.667
I think you're gonna ruin
the place for me.

31:14.750 --> 31:17.124
Your confidence in us
is inspiring.

31:18.708 --> 31:20.541
I wanna work nights
at the Marriott,

31:20.625 --> 31:24.416
so I can have a nice, easy spot
where I can finish out my time.

31:26.291 --> 31:28.500
I'm on the captain's list.
When I get promoted,

31:28.583 --> 31:30.333
I don't wanna get tossed back
into the bag.

31:30.416 --> 31:31.667
And where does Captain Haddix

31:31.750 --> 31:33.583
wanna finish out
his stellar career?

31:33.667 --> 31:35.166
Intel.

31:35.249 --> 31:38.917
Or if you guys can't swing that
for me, maybe the academy.

31:38.999 --> 31:41.625
-Anything else?
-No.

31:43.458 --> 31:44.583
It's a good meal.

31:46.875 --> 31:48.458
We should do this more often.

just finish this thought.

get there ourselves?

33:01.291 --> 33:02.500
You think I'm gonna tell
the cops?

33:02.583 --> 33:03.958
They don't know
where we're going.

just to put more money
in your pocket?

34:36.833 --> 34:39.124
And now, we've lost an earner
and I got people on me

34:39.208 --> 34:41.041
to take out Vincent,
which I'm not gonna do.

you didn't want to have anything
to do with the stuff.

in this office.

Well, for one thing,
he made lieutenant,

42:35.041 --> 42:37.208
and Commissioner Ward personally
put him there.

42:37.291 --> 42:39.416
That's his rabbi
in the department, and...

42:39.500 --> 42:43.708
Ward sees him as a candidate
for further elevation.

Are you telling me
the police commissioner

42:45.291 --> 42:46.583
doesn't work
for the mayor anymore?

42:49.124 --> 42:51.625
in Harlem, and with
the Bronx borough leadership,

42:51.708 --> 42:54.750
I don't think he has
the political capital right now

42:54.833 --> 42:57.792
to exile a black lieutenant
who has the commissioner's eye.

to move him

47:10.208 --> 47:11.208
And...

47:12.375 --> 47:13.583
you tell him the truth.

47:15.667 --> 47:18.166
And you wait for him
to love you anyway.

47:18.249 --> 47:20.083
You wait for him
to put his arms around you

47:20.166 --> 47:23.500
and tell you
that it's gonna be okay.

47:23.583 --> 47:26.166
And instead,
he calls you a name...

47:26.249 --> 47:28.541
and he tells you to get in
the God damn car.

47:28.625 --> 47:31.166
And you do, because you don't
really know what he means.

47:31.249 --> 47:32.917
Like, is he gonna take you
to one of those places

47:32.999 --> 47:34.875
where you go to be a mother
if you're not married?

47:34.958 --> 47:39.124
Is he gonna hide you
and your baby curves away...

47:39.208 --> 47:40.708

47:40.792 --> 47:41.792

they used to give those out

about me.

about you,

he went to park the car,

48:48.708 --> 48:51.708
and he's coming back,
or whatever, and...

48:52.625 --> 48:54.541
you don't think...

48:54.625 --> 48:58.458
that he got in the car and he
drove the fuck away from you.
