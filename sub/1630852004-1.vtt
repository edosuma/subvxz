00:24.640 --> 00:27.130
Good morning, Marielle.

00:27.180 --> 00:28.780
This is our home for the summer.

00:30.430 --> 00:31.840
I grew up in this place.

00:31.890 --> 00:32.890
It's beautiful here.

00:38.660 --> 00:40.270
Let's start clearing Nana's

00:40.320 --> 00:41.990
boxes to make space for the family.

00:43.630 --> 00:46.590
Tomorrow you will meet everyone.

03:48.690 --> 03:50.210
- You're awake too?

03:50.260 --> 03:53.670
A little.

04:00.060 --> 04:01.490
Hey, Marielle?
- Hm?

04:01.540 --> 04:02.820
- Happy birthday.

04:04.040 --> 04:07.450
Thank you, nounette.

04:23.570 --> 04:24.350
- Marielle's up.

04:24.400 --> 04:25.670
Why don't you go say hello?

04:30.370 --> 04:31.470
This is nice.

04:39.730 --> 04:40.560
- Hello there.

04:46.630 --> 04:51.020
- So, you're going to cook for us tonight?

04:51.070 --> 04:53.510
We finally get to see it for ourselves.

04:54.360 --> 04:56.470
- Don't make such a big deal of it.

04:56.520 --> 05:00.340
- This is our first family
meal together in years.

05:01.290 --> 05:04.070
I'm sorry if this is not
particularly important to you.

05:04.120 --> 05:06.030
- I mean, there's been
plenty of times when-

05:06.080 --> 05:09.000
- Roland, what is Marielle allergic to?

05:11.650 --> 05:13.050
Exactly.

05:13.100 --> 05:15.450
It's our first time all together

05:15.500 --> 05:17.420
since I took her to France with me.

05:19.720 --> 05:24.200
Marielle never had a
father figure in her life.

05:24.250 --> 05:26.830
She needs to spend some time with you.

05:33.700 --> 05:36.380
It's so nice to see you
sisters together again.

05:36.430 --> 05:38.560
Ada is growing so fast.

05:46.020 --> 05:48.080
I am not getting involved, but

05:49.530 --> 05:51.230
if you're ready to start,

05:51.280 --> 05:53.150
I could find you a contractor.

05:53.200 --> 05:53.980
- Really? You don't

05:54.030 --> 05:55.620
want to sign off on this first?

05:55.670 --> 05:56.500
- No, darling.

05:57.380 --> 05:59.420
I just want you to be in good hands.

06:03.550 --> 06:06.240
- So, what are you gonna try first?

06:06.290 --> 06:10.700
My bean cassoulet or my risotto?

06:10.750 --> 06:12.090
I don't mind.

06:12.140 --> 06:13.140
- Whatever you want.

06:27.270 --> 06:28.650
- Okay, I'm ready.

06:32.410 --> 06:33.240
Roland?

06:50.440 --> 06:51.270
Hello?

06:52.370 --> 06:54.290
Oh, hi, Hugo.

06:55.350 --> 06:56.670
Good.

06:56.720 --> 06:58.090
Do you want to speak to her?

07:01.230 --> 07:03.780
Guess who's looking for you?

07:03.830 --> 07:04.610
- Who?

07:04.660 --> 07:05.850
- Say hello.

07:05.900 --> 07:06.730
- Hello.

07:09.030 --> 07:10.220
Hi, daddy.

07:16.830 --> 07:18.510
- Thanks for waiting for me.

07:20.290 --> 07:23.040
- Ask me before giving the phone to her.

07:23.090 --> 07:25.240
- Her father wanted to speak with her.

07:25.290 --> 07:26.260
- When our dad wanted

07:26.310 --> 07:28.490
to do that sometimes you wouldn't let him.

07:28.540 --> 07:30.810
- It's not the same thing.

07:30.860 --> 07:31.690
- It is.

07:33.820 --> 07:34.720
I have my reasons.

07:43.070 --> 07:44.870
- You have both become so beautiful.

07:48.210 --> 07:49.630
I regret missing the years,

07:52.600 --> 07:54.600
but I intend to make that up to you now,

07:56.290 --> 07:57.400
to be with my girls.

08:01.680 --> 08:04.330
Marielle, welcome to England.

08:05.210 --> 08:06.040
Welcome home.

08:08.560 --> 08:11.290
Adrienne, you'e gonna
renovate your childhood home.

08:11.340 --> 08:13.660
I mean, what a gift that is.

08:15.350 --> 08:17.720
- This was my childhood home, Roland.

08:17.770 --> 08:18.820
This was my mother's

08:18.870 --> 08:20.360
house, let's not forget that.

08:20.410 --> 08:24.250
- Oh, annoying, nagging Nadine who I love.

08:24.300 --> 08:28.540
- Roland, just pass me the salad please.

08:33.670 --> 08:38.670
- So lucky we are to
spend the summer together.

08:41.800 --> 08:45.300
The
besest way to start my retiraaament!

08:48.390 --> 08:51.130
And to start it with
Marielle's 16th birthday

08:51.180 --> 08:52.430
is even more special.

08:55.290 --> 08:57.470
My little laves...

08:57.520 --> 09:00.280
the house is welcoming us to reconnect!

09:02.040 --> 09:05.710
I'm tired.

09:07.180 --> 09:08.990
She's 18.

09:10.060 --> 09:11.910
How do you think that makes her feel?

09:32.080 --> 09:35.800
Ada, let me help you.

09:35.850 --> 09:37.600
- For you.
- For me?

09:38.800 --> 09:40.460
- For your birthday.

09:41.680 --> 09:45.100
Thank you, nounette.

09:51.900 --> 09:54.460
- Thank you for your speech tonight.

09:54.510 --> 09:55.500
I'm proud of you.

09:55.550 --> 09:57.010
- Wait, let me finish my page.

10:06.290 --> 10:08.580
- Sorry to have interrupted your reading.

10:14.360 --> 10:18.840
It took my mother dying
for you to come back?

10:18.890 --> 10:20.460
- You left me, Nadine.

10:20.510 --> 10:21.440
You drove away.

10:21.490 --> 10:23.020
What for? To bring up our

10:23.070 --> 10:24.440
daughter on your own? Away

10:24.490 --> 10:26.570
from her father, away from her sister?

10:29.630 --> 10:31.000
- I drove away,

10:34.610 --> 10:36.760
but you could still have been their dad.

10:44.870 --> 10:45.650
- I'm sorry.

10:45.700 --> 10:48.450
I know how tough things have been for you.

10:51.810 --> 10:52.640
- Look,

10:57.750 --> 10:59.500
we were both unhappy.

11:00.740 --> 11:02.220
I wasn't naive anymore.

11:05.230 --> 11:06.450
- But that doesn't matter.

11:06.500 --> 11:08.330
We are here now.

11:09.530 --> 11:10.310
Are you upset

11:10.360 --> 11:12.180
because I try to get closer to her?

11:13.620 --> 11:15.020
- No.

11:15.070 --> 11:15.850
- Then what is it?

11:15.900 --> 11:17.070
You miss the theater?

11:20.260 --> 11:21.680
- A bit.

11:21.730 --> 11:22.560
- Ah.

11:24.560 --> 11:26.660
You don't think I find you sexy anymore.

11:26.710 --> 11:27.760
- Stop it.

11:28.600 --> 11:30.060
Those new panties eh?

11:30.110 --> 11:31.280
- Stop talking.

11:33.030 --> 11:36.730
I just want us to be better
parents this time around.

11:38.870 --> 11:41.640
And for you to know how
old your daughter is.

11:42.750 --> 11:45.050
Well, she
just seems a lot younger.

13:07.800 --> 13:11.210
Son of a bitch!

13:29.930 --> 13:31.550
- You know what?

13:31.600 --> 13:33.510
I changed my mind flowers.

13:33.560 --> 13:35.440
Flowers are important.

13:36.750 --> 13:40.020
My mother filled this
house with all sorts of...

13:40.070 --> 13:42.200
- We already agreed on the decking area.

13:42.250 --> 13:44.040
We can't keep doing this.

13:44.090 --> 13:47.560
I won't be able to work with
you if every five minutes...

13:47.610 --> 13:49.520
- Adrienne, listen to me.

13:49.570 --> 13:52.600
This BnB was her dream.

13:52.650 --> 13:54.210
I need to honor that now.

13:55.860 --> 13:57.420
She loved her flowers.

13:58.640 --> 14:00.270
Don't you remember?

14:00.320 --> 14:01.170
- I do, yes.

14:01.220 --> 14:02.640
I also remember how you used

14:02.690 --> 14:04.510
to scream at Nana Lottie sometimes,

14:04.560 --> 14:06.450
not getting rid of anything,

14:06.500 --> 14:09.840
piling up too much stuff,
for living in the past.

14:11.230 --> 14:13.580
Don't be like her, maman.

14:13.630 --> 14:14.460
- Fine.

14:15.400 --> 14:17.100
But that's not true.

14:17.150 --> 14:19.380
I never raised my voice.

14:19.430 --> 14:21.480
You must've just interpreted it that way.

14:22.440 --> 14:24.160
- You have to trust me, all right?

14:25.670 --> 14:26.820
I'm doing this for you.

14:29.600 --> 14:31.820
- Ah, it's Ada.

14:31.870 --> 14:32.700
Ada.

14:35.220 --> 14:36.000
Yes.

14:36.050 --> 14:37.500
What do you want to do?

14:38.660 --> 14:40.000
- Find Marielle.

15:16.220 --> 15:17.610
Did you find her?

15:17.660 --> 15:18.830
Do you want an ice pop?

15:21.350 --> 15:23.680
Why don't you give it to Ada?

15:23.730 --> 15:24.690
- I can't.

15:25.930 --> 15:27.030
I'm working right now.

15:28.130 --> 15:30.180
- Adrienne, I'm not her mother.

15:36.570 --> 15:37.350
- No one seems to

15:37.400 --> 15:39.060
know what it is to work anymore.

15:40.370 --> 15:42.070
- Don't be like this.

15:42.120 --> 15:44.520
- We're all here to be
together, all right?

15:46.490 --> 15:49.750
Where is Marielle?

15:49.800 --> 15:51.760
- You didn't find her?

15:51.810 --> 15:52.640
Where is she?

15:53.820 --> 15:55.230
Roland, come with me.

15:55.280 --> 15:56.250
We have to go now.

16:28.710 --> 16:32.060
Everyone when they're too
young wants to run away.

16:35.800 --> 16:36.680
- Should I drive?

16:36.730 --> 16:37.560
I'm sorry.

16:40.000 --> 16:40.930
- Let me go alone.

16:42.730 --> 16:44.210
She's not used to you yet.

16:45.780 --> 16:49.220
I thought all of us coming here together

16:49.270 --> 16:54.270
would make her warm to this
place, but I'm worried, Roland.

16:54.320 --> 16:55.150
I'm worried.

16:59.040 --> 17:00.090
Where did I go wrong?

17:00.960 --> 17:02.180
- Crustaceans!

17:02.230 --> 17:03.550
- What?

17:03.600 --> 17:05.670
- Well, that's what
she's allergic to, right?

17:06.840 --> 17:11.250
- Roland, I have a feeling
she ventured to the water.

17:17.350 --> 17:19.660
- You always have a good feelings.

17:42.230 --> 17:45.150
Marielle!

17:45.200 --> 17:50.200
Marielle!

17:53.100 --> 17:54.270
My little girl!

17:54.320 --> 17:55.580
What's happened?

17:55.630 --> 17:59.050
I wanted
to swim, but then I got lost and-

18:00.010 --> 18:01.000
- Well of course you

18:01.050 --> 18:02.900
got lost. You don't remember this place.

18:04.340 --> 18:07.730
Be careful!

18:07.780 --> 18:10.670
- Here, keep it.

18:12.220 --> 18:13.900
Thank you.

18:13.950 --> 18:16.680
Thank you for rescuing her.

18:17.620 --> 18:18.450
- No trouble.

18:23.410 --> 18:25.400
- Well, it was nice to meet you.

18:25.450 --> 18:26.280
Thank you.

18:27.200 --> 18:28.490
We should go now,

18:28.540 --> 18:31.160
otherwise my husband will
think I've abandoned him.

18:31.210 --> 18:32.620
- Have you?

18:32.670 --> 18:33.510
- What?

18:34.750 --> 18:36.780
- Abandoned him, so to speak.

18:36.830 --> 18:39.390
I don't know
why my relationship

18:39.440 --> 18:41.420
should interest a stranger.

18:41.470 --> 18:45.760
- You almost ran into
me earlier on the road.

18:47.310 --> 18:48.580
- Earlier on the road?

18:48.630 --> 18:49.460
- See?

18:51.510 --> 18:52.960
I wouldn't call us strangers.

18:54.130 --> 18:55.570
- She's only just 18.

18:56.990 --> 18:58.410
We're going home.

19:06.300 --> 19:08.440
- He didn't mean it, you know.

19:08.490 --> 19:09.610
Your dad.

19:09.660 --> 19:13.960
You were so excited to
come here as a child.

19:14.010 --> 19:16.010
Nana Lottie loved you very much.

19:18.370 --> 19:23.370
Please, Marielle, I need
you to give this a chance.

19:23.420 --> 19:25.220
You can't just leave me like this.

19:25.270 --> 19:26.290
You can't.

19:26.340 --> 19:29.760
I'm not used to it.
I can't sleep with her boxes piled in my room.

19:31.950 --> 19:34.360
I'm not mad
at papa, but it's weird.

19:34.410 --> 19:35.870
We're kind of like strangers.

19:35.920 --> 19:37.980
- He reads a lot, like you.

19:39.490 --> 19:41.530
You have more in common than you think.

19:44.120 --> 19:45.630
I took a wrong turn.

19:45.680 --> 19:47.670
I don't recognize this road.

19:47.720 --> 19:51.810
It's easy to get lost here.

19:51.860 --> 19:53.760
Just be careful, all right?

19:55.110 --> 19:58.160
I never really knew my father
because of the car accident.

19:59.260 --> 20:01.100
Your head is always in the clouds...

20:01.150 --> 20:03.970
Mum I know.

20:04.020 --> 20:05.570
Do you like him?

20:05.620 --> 20:08.190
Well yeah, he's my dad...

20:08.240 --> 20:10.010
- That's not who I meant.

20:10.060 --> 20:12.090
It's okay, Marielle.

20:12.140 --> 20:14.220
You're allowed to want to like somebody.

20:16.610 --> 20:17.440
- Vases.

20:19.160 --> 20:20.710
- Ah, perfect.

20:22.380 --> 20:23.210
Okay.

20:27.890 --> 20:29.010
This one, this one.

20:29.060 --> 20:30.980
Yeah, perfect.

20:31.030 --> 20:34.550
- But we're packing up
these boxes for the BnB, no?

20:34.600 --> 20:35.850
Why are you opening them?

20:37.010 --> 20:38.180
- Because they're

20:38.230 --> 20:40.160
beautiful pieces. We could use these, mum.

20:40.210 --> 20:42.260
- Don't you think Nana
Lottie would like it?

20:42.310 --> 20:44.510
- It's just, it's not ready. We haven't

20:44.560 --> 20:46.450
even started the building work.

20:46.500 --> 20:47.810
- Smile!

20:47.860 --> 20:50.080
- Put that away, Roland.

20:50.130 --> 20:52.440
You can't just do whatever you want.

20:52.490 --> 20:54.370
Mum it's no big deal.

20:54.420 --> 20:55.800
- Just leave it, okay?

20:55.850 --> 20:57.260
And plus it was daddy who-

20:57.310 --> 20:59.790
- Oh, of course it was daddy.

21:12.830 --> 21:14.140
This is what my

21:14.190 --> 21:15.770
mum and sister look like

21:15.820 --> 21:17.130
together. It's strange to

21:17.180 --> 21:18.840
think that mum had a whole other

21:19.690 --> 21:21.160
life before me, raising

21:22.030 --> 21:23.680
Adrienne with dad. Is this what

21:23.730 --> 21:24.890
they would do?

21:24.940 --> 21:26.880
Play house? Make arts and crafts?

21:26.930 --> 21:29.700
Before Adrienne left and
mum and dad were fighting,

21:29.750 --> 21:30.880
before I was born,

21:32.030 --> 21:34.200
sometimes I imagine Adrienne's childhood

21:34.250 --> 21:35.500
as if it were my own.

21:44.780 --> 21:48.190
“I drift toward waves”
“With fog in my eyes
A boat arises”

21:54.170 --> 21:54.950
Sorry, Nick,

21:55.000 --> 21:56.550
but this won't work out anymore.

21:56.600 --> 21:58.520
Thank you so much for your help so far.

21:58.570 --> 22:00.450
- After everything I've done for you?

22:00.500 --> 22:03.630
I came here and I saved this place.

22:03.680 --> 22:05.330
I made it beautiful.

22:07.830 --> 22:09.680
Lucy, I don't know where else to go.

22:12.700 --> 22:13.530
Please.

22:14.620 --> 22:15.930
- I'm sorry.

22:15.980 --> 22:18.160
Nick, don't take it badly.

22:19.800 --> 22:20.580
We can be friends.

22:20.630 --> 22:21.460
- Don't touch me.

22:22.750 --> 22:25.900
Don't look at me like
I'm some sad, worthless

22:25.950 --> 22:27.180
"son of a bitch"!

22:27.230 --> 22:28.010
You know what?

22:28.060 --> 22:29.530
I'm the one who feels bad for you,

22:29.580 --> 22:31.350
to be stuck in a place like this.

22:31.400 --> 22:32.770
Where you goin' with your life?

22:32.820 --> 22:34.390
It's a dead end road here.

22:35.360 --> 22:36.610
A fucking dead end road!

22:58.660 --> 22:59.490
You ok?

23:05.490 --> 23:07.640
- No one ever really cares, kid.

23:11.740 --> 23:13.970
You try and make an effort,

23:16.900 --> 23:19.300
and then everything disappears.

23:24.410 --> 23:25.240
Fuck!

23:28.070 --> 23:28.900
- Hey.

23:34.040 --> 23:34.880
It's okay.

23:44.270 --> 23:46.630
So... "son on a bitch"...

23:46.680 --> 23:48.290
Remember that phrase?

23:48.340 --> 23:49.190
- What can I say?

23:50.060 --> 23:51.060
It stuck in my head.

23:59.230 --> 24:00.990
- We're changing our house.

24:01.040 --> 24:02.570
You want to help?

24:02.620 --> 24:03.930
- Oh, no, no, no.

24:03.980 --> 24:05.750
Got some plans...

24:05.800 --> 24:07.300
- You may like it.

24:13.660 --> 24:15.410
- Your English isn't bad, you know.

24:27.750 --> 24:29.050
- Where should I put this?

24:31.480 --> 24:33.980
- Up there I suppose.

24:34.030 --> 24:35.530
- Over the mirror?

24:40.410 --> 24:42.140
- What is that?

24:42.190 --> 24:44.200
- I had it made.

24:44.250 --> 24:46.000
You know what?

24:46.050 --> 24:47.030
Nevermind.

24:48.180 --> 24:50.170
God forbid you should become a little

24:50.220 --> 24:51.350
romantic once in a while.

24:51.400 --> 24:52.180
- All right...

24:52.230 --> 24:54.240
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

24:56.700 --> 24:58.440
Come on, come give me a cuddle.

24:58.490 --> 24:59.320
Come on.

25:06.580 --> 25:10.330
- I decided to try it
again once and for all.

25:13.820 --> 25:16.200
There's plenty of roles for older women,

25:16.250 --> 25:17.070
and I'm sure I...

25:17.120 --> 25:18.410
and I'll play for Arsenal.

25:18.460 --> 25:19.460
How does that sound?

25:20.470 --> 25:21.740
- I'm serious.

25:21.790 --> 25:23.300
- Yeah, pull the other one.

25:28.510 --> 25:31.460
This is the
last audition I'll try.

25:31.510 --> 25:34.020
Please don't ruin it for me.

25:34.070 --> 25:35.430
- Don't be like that.

25:50.250 --> 25:52.210
- Marielle, no.

25:52.260 --> 25:54.850
We've had enough of the
swimming, all right?

25:54.900 --> 25:56.640
Come, run some errands with me.

25:59.840 --> 26:03.320
Marielle, I'm sorry, but I'm your mother

26:03.370 --> 26:05.710
and that shirt is really disgusting.

26:05.760 --> 26:07.180
Whatever.

26:07.230 --> 26:09.040
It looks really ugly on you.

26:09.090 --> 26:10.690
It's as if you do it on purpose.

26:16.030 --> 26:20.750
- I am just listening to
this sexy '80s superstar.

26:23.350 --> 26:25.360
- Stop it, Roland!

26:35.750 --> 26:37.130
- Mummy?

26:37.180 --> 26:38.960
I want to go on a bike ride.

26:39.010 --> 26:40.340
I'm bored.

26:41.310 --> 26:43.180
Not right now.

26:43.230 --> 26:44.660
But daddy says...

26:44.710 --> 26:46.480
- Look, your bike is broken.

26:46.530 --> 26:48.030
When I've got time, I'll fix it

26:48.080 --> 26:49.280
and then we'll go, okay?

26:52.010 --> 26:55.160
Okay.

26:55.210 --> 26:57.450
Where is this song from?

26:57.500 --> 26:59.280
- When I first met your father,

27:00.150 --> 27:01.910
he helped me to make an album.

27:03.180 --> 27:06.600
Oh right,
that's really nice. Do you miss it?

27:10.010 --> 27:11.000
Sometimes.

27:12.650 --> 27:16.670
But the spotlight was a
mere moment in a lifetime

27:16.720 --> 27:20.680
of standing right next to it, in the dark.

27:28.050 --> 27:28.880
- Ada?

27:34.180 --> 27:36.260
Are you in here, sweetie?

27:37.290 --> 27:39.290
Where'd she go?

27:39.340 --> 27:40.170
Ada?

27:46.200 --> 27:48.250
Ada!

27:48.300 --> 27:53.230
Where are you?

27:53.280 --> 27:54.110
Ada?

27:55.070 --> 27:57.750
It's not funny anymore.

27:57.800 --> 27:59.150
Ada, where are you sweetie?

28:14.590 --> 28:15.590
- Hello little girl.

28:16.430 --> 28:17.380
Is your mummy home?

28:23.460 --> 28:24.290
Come.

28:39.690 --> 28:42.240
- Who are you and what are
you doing with my child?

28:44.800 --> 28:48.130
- I hear you're in need of some fixing up.

28:55.970 --> 28:58.330
- Thanks for bringing her back.

28:58.380 --> 28:59.320
Did anyone

28:59.370 --> 29:01.460
tell you how strikingly beautiful you are?

29:17.390 --> 29:18.890
- You look beautiful, darling.

29:21.560 --> 29:22.390
Stop fidgeting.

29:33.480 --> 29:36.730
Go get changed. Go inside.

29:39.560 --> 29:41.480
How did you find our house?

29:41.530 --> 29:43.930
- Oh, I took a wrong turn.

29:44.770 --> 29:45.600
- You know him?

29:47.200 --> 29:47.980
- Yes.

29:48.030 --> 29:49.040
We met the other day.

29:49.090 --> 29:49.880
He's the one who...

29:49.930 --> 29:52.590
- Your little one was all alone outside.

29:56.010 --> 29:56.840
- Ada.

29:58.370 --> 30:00.090
- Your windows could use a new coat.

30:01.300 --> 30:02.490
- Yeah.

30:02.540 --> 30:05.020
Every day I tell my husband to fix them.

30:06.500 --> 30:08.000
- Sorry, I can't help myself.

30:09.030 --> 30:12.700
This place needs some work.

30:12.750 --> 30:13.580
It's what I do.

30:15.250 --> 30:16.480
Really?

30:16.530 --> 30:17.360
- Yeah.

30:18.440 --> 30:19.820
Civil engineer by trade.

30:20.760 --> 30:21.590
- All right.

30:23.640 --> 30:25.680
We need a contractor for the summer.

30:25.730 --> 30:27.690
We're turning it into a BnB.

30:31.130 --> 30:34.160
- My older daughter,
Adrienne, is our designer.

30:35.310 --> 30:36.140
- Great.

30:38.220 --> 30:39.220
Beautiful & smart.

30:40.700 --> 30:43.310
- Well, let me show you the house.

30:46.500 --> 30:48.210
This home means a lot to me.

30:49.230 --> 30:50.620
It belonged to my mother.

30:51.940 --> 30:53.110
I got married here.

30:55.460 --> 30:57.110
I can trust you with it, right?

30:58.300 --> 31:00.620
- You have nothing to worry about.

31:01.910 --> 31:03.910
- Things never end well when you say that.

31:03.960 --> 31:06.410
- You're gonna be very
satisfied with the results.

31:14.950 --> 31:16.230
- Are you tired, sweetie?

31:16.280 --> 31:17.710
- Where's daddy?

31:19.570 --> 31:20.850
- Daddy's at home, baby.

31:23.630 --> 31:25.040
You'll see him after summer.

31:25.090 --> 31:27.280
- He doesn't wanna be with us?

31:28.250 --> 31:29.250
- No, no, no.

31:29.300 --> 31:31.450
It's not that, sweetie.

31:31.500 --> 31:36.500
It's just, I wanted to spend some time

31:36.760 --> 31:39.240
because after this summer

31:42.540 --> 31:46.670
mummy's going away for a
little while and I'll miss you.

31:48.100 --> 31:49.020
I'm so sorry.

31:49.070 --> 31:51.100
I'm sorry about what happened earlier.

31:53.100 --> 31:55.560
Do you want me to call daddy?

31:57.470 --> 31:59.040
Do you want daddy to come visit?

31:59.090 --> 31:59.920
- Yes.

32:02.020 --> 32:02.890
I'm not

32:02.940 --> 32:05.760
swimming much because it
worries mum, since that time.

32:05.810 --> 32:08.290
In Paris, mum's flat is
on such a noisy street

32:08.340 --> 32:10.240
I can never hear myself think.

32:10.290 --> 32:11.950
That's why I like him.

32:12.000 --> 32:14.690
He's quiet, but he says a lot.

32:15.590 --> 32:16.810
A peaceful landscape.

32:18.890 --> 32:20.660
- I love your vision and passion.

32:22.660 --> 32:24.450
The lake house is gonna be perfect.

32:24.500 --> 32:28.300
You're brimming with excitement
right now, it's cute.

32:28.350 --> 32:29.960
- Turn the page.

32:31.190 --> 32:32.020
What's next?

32:34.450 --> 32:35.320
- Leave it with me.

32:35.370 --> 32:36.420
I'll survey the area.

32:38.630 --> 32:42.050
Mummy will tell you.

32:44.600 --> 32:45.430
Ada?

32:59.600 --> 33:00.430
- Nice view.

33:04.730 --> 33:05.910
- Fuck.

33:08.310 --> 33:09.920
- Can I see the photo?

33:09.970 --> 33:11.480
- Hi.

33:11.530 --> 33:12.360
Yeah, Em.

33:13.320 --> 33:14.450
Hang on a minute.

33:48.010 --> 33:50.300
- Are you out of your mind?

33:50.350 --> 33:51.180
It's really hot.

33:52.740 --> 33:54.410
You need to get out of the sun.

33:54.460 --> 33:56.030
It's fine.

33:56.080 --> 33:56.920
It's not.

33:57.820 --> 33:58.650
It's not fine.

34:04.720 --> 34:07.350
Daddy's also reading this.

34:07.400 --> 34:09.060
Oh really?

34:09.110 --> 34:10.310
You two are buddies now?

34:11.290 --> 34:14.710
I know what I'm doing.

34:18.390 --> 34:19.220
You're 18.

34:31.920 --> 34:32.830
- Where are you going?

34:32.880 --> 34:34.280
We're going cycling!

34:35.800 --> 34:38.490
- But look, it's clouding over.

34:40.310 --> 34:42.070
I'm taking our crustacean

34:42.120 --> 34:43.820
daughter out for lunch!

34:43.870 --> 34:46.170
- But it looks like rain.

34:47.380 --> 34:48.550
- Come on.

34:48.600 --> 34:49.880
Yes!

34:49.930 --> 34:50.760
Woo!

34:52.580 --> 34:53.420
Go.

34:56.270 --> 34:57.050
- Papa?

34:57.100 --> 34:57.930
- Yes, darling?

34:57.980 --> 34:59.420
Try it in English.

35:05.550 --> 35:07.460
- Ok. What do you
think if I took a year off

35:07.510 --> 35:10.160
before starting university in Lille?

35:12.200 --> 35:14.010
- Why would you want to do that?

35:14.060 --> 35:15.240
I dunno...

35:15.290 --> 35:18.190
- I just don't want to go back to France.

35:19.300 --> 35:21.430
If I were to try something adventurous,

35:21.480 --> 35:23.060
shouldn't it be now?

35:23.110 --> 35:24.630
- Like what?

35:24.680 --> 35:27.440
- Like go with Adrienne maybe.

35:28.360 --> 35:30.080
I know she has her building project,

35:30.130 --> 35:34.780
but I could work just
to get some experience.

35:34.830 --> 35:36.180
- Thanks, Paul.

35:36.230 --> 35:39.130
I think that is a most excellent idea.

35:39.180 --> 35:40.980
You remind me of me back in the day.

35:57.240 --> 35:58.590
- "Whoever you are,

35:58.640 --> 36:01.970
I have always depended on
the kindness of strangers."

36:03.220 --> 36:04.720
- What?

36:04.770 --> 36:05.600
- Nothing.

36:07.540 --> 36:08.630
Thank you for coming.

36:10.060 --> 36:12.470
Your dedication means a lot.

36:12.520 --> 36:13.470
- It's no big deal.

36:15.050 --> 36:17.560
Getting my hands dirty is the best part.

36:17.610 --> 36:18.860
Adrienne mentioned you'll

36:18.910 --> 36:20.260
be working on the deck now.

36:21.660 --> 36:22.710
- That's right, boss.

36:34.210 --> 36:35.480
- What's the matter?

36:35.530 --> 36:37.100
- I'm too hot and too tired.

36:40.530 --> 36:41.320
- Okay.

36:41.370 --> 36:44.270
Well, should we go and
get you some ice pops?

36:44.320 --> 36:45.760
Yes?

36:45.810 --> 36:47.880
And when you come visit me, we

36:47.930 --> 36:49.470
could get you some then too, I'll

36:49.520 --> 36:50.430
Ihave lots of them.

36:50.480 --> 36:52.460
Lots of lots for you, yes?

36:52.510 --> 36:53.970
Would you like that?

36:54.020 --> 36:55.450
Yeah?

36:55.500 --> 36:56.280
Okay.

36:56.330 --> 36:57.330
You know what?

36:58.630 --> 37:00.550
We need to be tough, buddy.

37:01.400 --> 37:02.800
Say, "I am tough."

37:02.850 --> 37:03.750
- I am tough.

37:03.800 --> 37:05.410
- Yes.

37:05.460 --> 37:06.290
Come.

37:08.810 --> 37:11.010
- And that's how you
make an old fashioned.

37:14.150 --> 37:17.170
This is how a true lady impresses a man.

37:17.220 --> 37:18.000
- Papa...

37:18.050 --> 37:22.010
- But, the most important
thing is the orange peel.

37:23.480 --> 37:24.310
Of course.

37:28.340 --> 37:29.170
- You're lucky.

37:55.380 --> 37:58.420
- Yes please, some water.

37:58.470 --> 37:59.550
Oh, thanks, sweetheart.

37:59.600 --> 38:02.130
That was great fun.

38:02.180 --> 38:03.590
Yes, I know, I know!

38:03.640 --> 38:06.480
I am running in the
house with muddy shoes!

38:06.530 --> 38:07.360
Ah!

38:10.270 --> 38:13.180
- Marielle, I've been doing
a lot of thinking today...

38:13.230 --> 38:15.650
Not now, mum.

38:15.700 --> 38:17.100
- Why do you look so weird?

38:18.790 --> 38:19.790
- I did my hair.

38:22.630 --> 38:23.950
- I'm going for a run.

38:24.000 --> 38:25.260
- But you'll get sick!

38:39.480 --> 38:40.320
- Hey.

38:44.400 --> 38:46.260
- Why did you ignore me yesterday?

39:01.020 --> 39:01.850
- Where?

39:03.190 --> 39:06.120
- Back by the bushes, after the pond.

39:16.960 --> 39:17.790
Nevermind.

39:23.150 --> 39:23.980
- Put this back.

39:39.510 --> 39:41.240
I cut down some trees back there.

39:43.080 --> 39:45.410
I still need to clear the surface up.

39:45.460 --> 39:49.060
It's amazing actually, the amount of nature

39:49.110 --> 39:51.470
that gets tossed up from building works.

40:17.710 --> 40:19.910
What do you like most about it here?

40:19.960 --> 40:22.120
- I like the days where I wake up early.

40:27.570 --> 40:30.990
Naturally.

40:32.060 --> 40:33.720
When there's only a little bit of

40:33.770 --> 40:36.290
light out and the home is asleep.

41:04.910 --> 41:05.820
- How was your run?

41:05.870 --> 41:07.640
- Short, but sweet.

41:09.560 --> 41:11.620
- Would you like some company next time?

41:39.260 --> 41:40.090
- Hey, mum?

41:42.210 --> 41:44.560
I'm going to take a year
off before university.

41:45.430 --> 41:46.260
- What?

41:47.190 --> 41:48.240
Is that right?

41:48.290 --> 41:49.170
- Oui.

41:49.220 --> 41:51.970
Daddy and I agreed that I
should try another experience...

41:52.020 --> 41:53.280
- No, no, no, no.

41:53.330 --> 41:54.730
You can't just withdraw.

41:54.780 --> 41:55.810
- I know.

41:55.860 --> 41:56.900
I'm not withdrawing.

41:56.950 --> 41:58.760
I'm taking time off.

41:58.810 --> 42:01.830
- You're acting spoiled and ungrateful.

42:03.610 --> 42:06.480
I don't like this new English
attitude you've adopted.

42:07.340 --> 42:10.110
Come on, mum.

42:10.160 --> 42:11.040
What's wrong with-

42:11.090 --> 42:12.350
- Nothing's wrong with me.

42:12.400 --> 42:14.150
Why does everyone ask that?

42:15.240 --> 42:18.630
It's just that life is
hard sometimes, Marielle,

42:19.690 --> 42:22.190
and you can't just abandon someplace

42:22.240 --> 42:24.780
because right now you don't
feel like going to school.

42:24.830 --> 42:26.290
You're smarter than that.

42:26.340 --> 42:28.610
- But you're blowing it out of proportion.

42:28.660 --> 42:29.740
- I'm not.

42:32.160 --> 42:34.640
How come you're so sure you won't like it?

42:34.690 --> 42:36.970
You should at least give it a try.

42:37.020 --> 42:40.140
You can’t decide for me.
And Adrienne is leaving-

42:40.190 --> 42:41.390
- To further her career.

42:42.570 --> 42:45.060
She's been working on that
PhD project for years now.

42:45.110 --> 42:47.020
Come on, Marielle.

42:49.150 --> 42:52.570
Fine.

42:54.520 --> 42:57.590
- Okay, so how about if I
stayed at the house this year?

42:57.640 --> 43:00.240
I could use a quiet room
to improve my English

43:00.290 --> 43:02.090
and self-reflect.

43:02.140 --> 43:03.380
- Self-reflect?

43:04.400 --> 43:05.230
At the house?

43:07.890 --> 43:08.760
No, Marielle.

43:09.650 --> 43:13.270
Being an adult is about
accepting your choices

43:13.320 --> 43:15.430
and being responsible.

43:16.690 --> 43:20.690
For instance, there's this
play I'd like to audition for

43:20.740 --> 43:22.910
in an ideal world.

43:22.960 --> 43:25.810
But I can't just go off and be an actress.

43:25.860 --> 43:26.680
It's absurd.

43:26.730 --> 43:27.770
- You should do the play!

43:27.820 --> 43:29.500
- You need to think this through.

43:29.550 --> 43:31.050
- You should do the play, mum.

43:32.020 --> 43:33.230
I think that's great.

43:34.230 --> 43:35.530
- You should go to school!

43:37.870 --> 43:40.030
- Mum always says to be more adventurous,

43:40.080 --> 43:41.680
live life to the fullest.

43:41.730 --> 43:44.550
Being in love makes everything sweeter.

43:44.600 --> 43:47.820
Why does she always have to
complicate things with dad?

43:47.870 --> 43:48.880
My first portrait.

43:59.990 --> 44:01.890
- I'm glad you're going to see Claire.

44:02.860 --> 44:05.320
Maybe she can help you to reconsider, huh?

44:05.370 --> 44:06.990
Referee!

44:07.040 --> 44:09.140
- And don't forget on Sunday...

44:09.190 --> 44:12.410
There's
the audition. Of course I'll be there.

44:12.460 --> 44:13.740
Shoot!

44:13.790 --> 44:14.980
Oh, you donkey!

45:18.580 --> 45:19.790
- Speak French?

45:19.840 --> 45:20.620
- No.
- No?

45:21.500 --> 45:22.990
So you don't speak Italian?

45:23.040 --> 45:23.820
- A little bit.

45:23.870 --> 45:24.870
- A little bit?
- Ciao.

45:24.920 --> 45:26.040
- Oh, ciao.

45:26.090 --> 45:27.360
Bella...

45:27.410 --> 45:29.090
Two words, that's wonderful.

45:33.280 --> 45:36.920
Certo.

45:36.970 --> 45:37.970
Almost three.

45:38.020 --> 45:38.800
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

45:38.850 --> 45:40.060
- What do you mean almost?

45:40.110 --> 45:41.160
That was three.

45:41.210 --> 45:42.360
That was a solid three.

45:43.910 --> 45:45.990
- Hey, there you are.

45:49.020 --> 45:50.420
I should have picked you up.

45:52.370 --> 45:53.970
- It's okay.

45:54.020 --> 45:57.960
- Anyway, the reservation
is under Ventura.

45:58.010 --> 45:58.840
- Right.

46:01.090 --> 46:02.070
Ventura.

46:02.120 --> 46:04.190
Oh, here you are.

46:04.240 --> 46:05.590
Thanks for coming back here.

46:05.640 --> 46:06.780
Great.

46:06.830 --> 46:09.660
- Nick, you know about
continental breakfast, yeah?

46:09.710 --> 46:10.750
Yeah.

46:10.800 --> 46:12.050
- And Emily.

46:12.100 --> 46:14.030
Emily, you have...

46:14.080 --> 46:17.990
- Emily couldn't make
it, but this is Marielle.

46:19.220 --> 46:20.050
- Great.

46:22.680 --> 46:24.650
Here are the keys to your suite.

46:24.700 --> 46:25.530
- Thanks, Soph.

46:26.650 --> 46:27.750
- You're welcome.

46:27.800 --> 46:30.020
Tonight's acoustic night at the garden.

46:30.070 --> 46:30.900
- Great.

46:47.280 --> 46:48.110
- Wow.

46:49.140 --> 46:50.440
This is nice.

46:50.490 --> 46:51.320
- You're nice.

46:52.250 --> 46:53.090
And sweet.

46:56.170 --> 46:57.000
And beautiful.

47:05.440 --> 47:07.190
- That was embarrassing over there.

47:09.920 --> 47:10.750
Why?

47:11.720 --> 47:12.550
- Why?

47:17.320 --> 47:19.620
Did you bring me here as a backup?

47:19.670 --> 47:24.000
- Marielle, look, Emily's in the past.

47:24.050 --> 47:25.880
Yes, she's someone I knew.

47:28.730 --> 47:30.030
Now you're someone I know.

47:32.410 --> 47:33.820
- Really?

47:33.870 --> 47:34.700
- Yeah, kid.

48:06.370 --> 48:07.880
- Wait.

48:07.930 --> 48:08.760
- What?

48:09.790 --> 48:12.630
- Is it okay if we don't have sex?

48:14.430 --> 48:15.980
- We're practically having sex.

48:17.090 --> 48:17.940
Let's just do it.

48:20.120 --> 48:23.540
All right.

48:25.800 --> 48:26.600
- "He's an animal.

48:26.650 --> 48:28.160
He has an animal's habits."

48:32.620 --> 48:33.820
- Whenever you're ready.

48:39.640 --> 48:40.430
- "How much does it

48:40.480 --> 48:41.850
cost for these furs?

48:45.890 --> 48:48.840
- Those were a tribute
from an admirer of mine."

48:57.750 --> 48:58.590
Oh, I...

49:01.110 --> 49:01.940
Oh.

49:03.960 --> 49:06.020
- I acted like a dick before.

49:06.070 --> 49:07.380
I'm sorry.

49:07.430 --> 49:08.950
- You did.

49:09.000 --> 49:10.300
- We had a bit of a fight.

49:11.580 --> 49:12.410
People do that.

49:14.050 --> 49:15.390
Right?
- I guess.

49:20.060 --> 49:22.210
- Do you know what else people do?

49:54.460 --> 49:55.490
- Sorry.

49:55.540 --> 49:56.630
I'm so sorry.

50:10.510 --> 50:12.930
So, I hope everything's okay.

50:14.660 --> 50:16.030
I know you're in good hands,

50:16.080 --> 50:19.480
but it would have been nice,

50:19.530 --> 50:21.310
really nice if you showed up.

50:25.610 --> 50:26.660
Did you go get drunk?

50:28.350 --> 50:30.100
- I'll learn to kiss you better.

50:30.150 --> 50:32.760
- Well, right timing,
that's the first thing.

50:36.210 --> 50:37.500
You were beautiful.

50:40.260 --> 50:42.260
I missed the end of the match to be here.

50:43.560 --> 50:46.480
- Well, that's very kind of, honey.

51:11.860 --> 51:13.660
- You look beautiful in the morning.

51:17.970 --> 51:21.720
“A confetti carnival in my head
I ponder it all as I lay in bed”

51:42.330 --> 51:43.820
Let’s go?

51:43.870 --> 51:44.840
On... y?

51:44.890 --> 51:47.120
I have to
be back in the afternoon.

51:48.350 --> 51:49.180
- Me too.

51:51.750 --> 51:53.650
I'm meeting with your sister actually.

51:58.680 --> 52:02.100
We're already Monday...

52:03.750 --> 52:04.580
- What?

52:08.790 --> 52:11.640
Adrienne, I
don't see any progress

52:11.690 --> 52:12.770
with the deck at all.

52:13.800 --> 52:15.770
Has he even been doing any work?

52:22.360 --> 52:24.870
- We decided against using
wood for the decking area.

52:24.920 --> 52:26.590
I said I wanted glass.

52:27.460 --> 52:29.740
- Well, we had some leftover timber

52:29.790 --> 52:31.820
from the upstairs window frames,

52:31.870 --> 52:33.220
so I thought we'd use that.

52:34.460 --> 52:36.030
- I said I wanted glass.

52:37.680 --> 52:40.230
Marielle, come help me tape
up the lake house area.

52:48.240 --> 52:49.020
- I don't know know

52:49.070 --> 52:51.040
why Adrienne keeps to herself so much.

52:51.090 --> 52:51.870
I want to tell her,

52:51.920 --> 52:54.130
but I know she would disapprove.

52:54.180 --> 52:56.050
My subject acts like I'm not here.

52:59.100 --> 53:00.360
- Just chop the tomatoes.

53:00.410 --> 53:03.510
- I am chopping the tomatoes.

53:03.560 --> 53:05.730
- What is that noise?

53:05.780 --> 53:06.620
- It's Hugo.

53:06.670 --> 53:09.010
He arrived a little bit
earlier, he's with Ada.

53:09.060 --> 53:11.480
- What's he doing, strangling her?

53:11.530 --> 53:12.360
- Just playing.

53:14.380 --> 53:15.160
That's him now.

53:15.210 --> 53:16.800
You'll get to meet him finally.

53:17.920 --> 53:18.750
- Hi.

53:21.300 --> 53:22.390
- Took the wrong turn?

53:22.440 --> 53:25.130
- I thought I'd stop by
and get extra work in.

53:25.180 --> 53:26.010
For you.

53:27.420 --> 53:31.350
It's a great one about
how the space of a home

53:31.400 --> 53:34.270
reflects the mentality
of the people in it.

53:34.320 --> 53:35.150
- Yes.

53:36.580 --> 53:38.560
I studied him in uni.

53:38.610 --> 53:41.060
That's very sweet.

53:44.950 --> 53:46.020
Oh, hi, Hugo.

53:47.230 --> 53:48.660
This is Nick.

53:48.710 --> 53:50.290
- Nick, contractor.

53:58.980 --> 54:00.400
- 17, 18, 19, 20.

54:04.680 --> 54:06.290
Coming, ready or not!

54:07.720 --> 54:09.820
He's taking a break?

54:09.870 --> 54:11.250
- Hey, where's Ada?

54:11.300 --> 54:13.550
- I don't know where Ada is.

54:19.630 --> 54:21.590
- Good of you to swing by.

54:21.640 --> 54:22.470
Have a beer.

54:25.150 --> 54:26.300
- This is lovely salad.

54:28.350 --> 54:30.530
You must be spending a
lot of time together.

54:35.700 --> 54:37.810
The house, it looks beautiful.

54:37.860 --> 54:38.970
What are the plans?

54:40.030 --> 54:41.400
- Yeah, it's going to be great.

54:41.450 --> 54:43.700
- Well, I think you better ask your wife.

54:43.750 --> 54:45.330
- We're going to have a lovely patio

54:45.380 --> 54:47.480
area designed by my beautiful daughter.

54:47.530 --> 54:48.490
- What is he doing?

54:48.540 --> 54:49.660
Pushups?

54:49.710 --> 54:50.780
Pull-ups?

54:53.330 --> 54:54.180
- Pushups.

54:55.590 --> 54:57.090
- It helps define the muscles.

54:59.020 --> 54:59.850
- Unbelievable.

55:05.600 --> 55:06.430
- Hi.

55:08.490 --> 55:11.170
- I didn't know we were all having lunch.

55:24.010 --> 55:25.570
Want to go to the beach?

55:25.620 --> 55:27.210
Mum, you know the one?

55:27.260 --> 55:28.800
- Well, Ada doesn't like the beach.

55:28.850 --> 55:29.960
- Hey!

55:30.010 --> 55:32.280
Hey, baby, do you want
to stay here with daddy?

55:33.660 --> 55:34.440
- Yeah.

55:34.490 --> 55:35.270
You know what?

55:35.320 --> 55:36.520
You go have your fun.

55:36.570 --> 55:37.400
We'll stay.

55:38.270 --> 55:39.100
Ada!

55:48.040 --> 55:50.390
- I'm sweaty, dirty...

55:50.440 --> 55:51.440
- It's okay.

56:13.800 --> 56:14.870
- Marielle! You don't need

56:14.920 --> 56:16.080
to bring a bathing suit.

56:17.750 --> 56:19.930
Roland, I'm ready in five.

56:19.980 --> 56:21.450
Don't leave with me!

56:26.360 --> 56:27.190
- Fuck.

56:43.920 --> 56:44.940
- Where were you?

56:46.890 --> 56:49.060
- Getting to know
the house a little better.

56:54.650 --> 56:56.710
- I wanna go to the beach.

56:56.760 --> 56:58.270
I wanna go together.

56:59.450 --> 57:01.120
- Aren't you and daddy staying here?

57:01.170 --> 57:02.000
- It's okay.

57:02.950 --> 57:04.760
I can go with him.

57:04.810 --> 57:05.640
See you there?

57:15.510 --> 57:20.510
- I thought you'd look strange
in a dress, but you don't.

57:20.730 --> 57:21.560
- Okay.

57:25.730 --> 57:26.830
- It was a compliment.

57:27.970 --> 57:29.320
Let me try again.

57:33.060 --> 57:33.890
What's so funny?

57:35.450 --> 57:36.280
- Nothing.

57:39.090 --> 57:42.380
I just didn't think you'd be nervous too.

57:42.430 --> 57:43.520
- I'm not nervous.

57:46.060 --> 57:49.320
Hey, if the sun ruins your skin you're

57:49.370 --> 57:50.740
gonna lose your beauty

57:51.880 --> 57:55.170
and you'll only have your intellect left.

57:59.120 --> 58:00.540
Maybe I am a little nervous.

58:13.320 --> 58:16.530
- "If a plane lands in the
middle of the Sahara Desert

58:16.580 --> 58:20.080
and moves one grain
of sand one millimeter,

58:22.170 --> 58:23.130
what happens?"

58:23.180 --> 58:24.430
- I don't know.

58:27.930 --> 58:28.930
- Go for swim?

58:31.430 --> 58:32.830
- I'm one step ahead of you.

58:34.010 --> 58:36.060
Been waiting for a moment alone with you.

58:36.990 --> 58:39.010
Tomorrow night, picnic spot, you and me.

58:39.060 --> 58:41.060
- I don't like the two of them together.

58:42.640 --> 58:44.030
I know Adrienne and Hugo are

58:44.080 --> 58:45.590
having problems at the moment,

58:45.640 --> 58:47.160
but it's just not right.

58:48.550 --> 58:51.080
With Hugo right there
and Ada for God's sake.

59:04.630 --> 59:07.250
Marielle, how can you listen to this man?

59:07.300 --> 59:09.120
- It is called a sense of humor.

59:11.070 --> 59:12.580
We are here to relax, no?

59:19.250 --> 59:20.080
- Enough.

59:33.290 --> 59:36.040
- Oh, come here honey, come here.

59:37.080 --> 59:37.970
- Thank you.

59:42.260 --> 59:44.560
- That swim must have felt real nice.

59:46.140 --> 59:47.050
- What happened?

59:48.760 --> 59:49.540
- She fell over.

59:49.590 --> 59:50.420
Come on, now.

59:58.250 --> 59:59.630
Are you ok?

59:59.680 --> 1:00:00.520
Yeah.

1:00:03.700 --> 1:00:06.070
I'm happy to sleep on the couch tonight.

1:00:06.120 --> 1:00:08.200
I'll do whatever it takes.

1:00:08.250 --> 1:00:09.700
- What?

1:00:09.750 --> 1:00:11.720
- To make this work.

1:00:11.770 --> 1:00:13.020
Let's have another child.

1:00:14.290 --> 1:00:15.960
- Hugo, not now.

1:00:16.010 --> 1:00:17.520
I can't think right now.

1:00:17.570 --> 1:00:18.350
- You always

1:00:18.400 --> 1:00:19.610
overthink. Just say it.

1:00:19.660 --> 1:00:20.960
Just say how you feel.

1:00:21.830 --> 1:00:22.680
- I feel like

1:00:24.290 --> 1:00:27.360
I want you to be someone you're not.

1:00:30.410 --> 1:00:31.980
- You think you're better than me?

1:00:33.120 --> 1:00:34.120
You're not better.

1:00:34.170 --> 1:00:34.950
- I know.

1:00:35.000 --> 1:00:35.780
- You're worse.

1:00:35.830 --> 1:00:36.840
Come here.
- I know.

1:00:38.110 --> 1:00:38.900
- Let's go for a

1:00:38.950 --> 1:00:40.810
drive. Do you fancy a little nap?

1:00:46.280 --> 1:00:47.170
- Lucy!

1:00:47.220 --> 1:00:49.130
Let me back in, please!

1:00:55.780 --> 1:00:57.190
Oh, not now, kid.

1:01:01.620 --> 1:01:02.970
- Are you in love with her?

1:01:05.510 --> 1:01:06.350
- Who?

1:01:11.960 --> 1:01:12.800
Marielle.

1:01:20.380 --> 1:01:22.670
- What the hell is going on here?

1:01:22.720 --> 1:01:24.210
Get out of my property.

1:01:25.560 --> 1:01:27.690
You're a disgraceful

1:01:27.740 --> 1:01:29.100
"Son of a bitch"

1:01:29.150 --> 1:01:29.990
as you say.

1:01:31.370 --> 1:01:33.000
You worthless, dirty scum.

1:01:33.050 --> 1:01:34.750
You should be ashamed of yourself.

1:01:42.290 --> 1:01:45.580
I think they'll be fine.

1:01:45.630 --> 1:01:46.880
- I'm not so sure.

1:01:48.530 --> 1:01:49.520
- Teaser.

1:01:56.000 --> 1:01:59.000
- Well, I don't suppose there's
anything we can do about it.

1:02:03.410 --> 1:02:05.330
What happened, darling?

1:02:06.880 --> 1:02:08.270
What happened to your dress?

1:02:08.320 --> 1:02:09.290
- Nothing.

1:02:09.340 --> 1:02:12.210
I went for a little hike
back there and it ripped.

1:02:13.700 --> 1:02:14.550
- Be careful, hm?

1:02:23.250 --> 1:02:24.510
- Can I have some?

1:02:24.560 --> 1:02:25.400
- What?

1:02:31.530 --> 1:02:32.360
Why not?

1:02:55.530 --> 1:02:56.370
- Hugo.

1:02:57.900 --> 1:02:59.250
Hugo.

1:02:59.300 --> 1:03:00.130
- Oh fuck.

1:03:04.990 --> 1:03:07.330
What the hell are you doing?

1:03:10.050 --> 1:03:12.450
Is this your version of
trying to become closer?

1:03:13.970 --> 1:03:15.020
- It was an accident.

1:03:30.890 --> 1:03:31.810
Adrienne!

1:03:40.240 --> 1:03:42.610
He never actually did any work.

1:03:46.700 --> 1:03:48.120
- Give me a drag.

1:03:50.770 --> 1:03:51.670
- You don't smoke.

1:03:58.970 --> 1:04:02.310
- I've never brought anyone here before.

1:04:08.720 --> 1:04:11.220
I told you it was a good spot.

1:04:12.730 --> 1:04:14.440
You're so special, Marielle.

1:04:26.100 --> 1:04:27.640
- Let's stay here forever.

1:04:38.240 --> 1:04:40.220
- Now you'll always remember me.

1:05:07.470 --> 1:05:08.250
- You know what? I

1:05:08.300 --> 1:05:09.080
don't know where

1:05:09.130 --> 1:05:10.290
Nick is. He should be

1:05:11.930 --> 1:05:13.630
here already. Clear up this mess.

1:05:16.760 --> 1:05:18.270
- I'm sure we'll sort it out.

1:05:20.090 --> 1:05:20.920
- Really?

1:05:22.600 --> 1:05:23.860
You're still trusting him?

1:05:25.830 --> 1:05:26.610
- I'll be back.

1:05:26.660 --> 1:05:28.070
I can't look at this chaos.

1:05:29.000 --> 1:05:30.600
- I'm sorry I let him touch you.

1:05:32.050 --> 1:05:33.910
Mummy, can I come with you?

1:05:47.430 --> 1:05:48.580
Why are we stopping?

1:05:48.630 --> 1:05:49.960
- Shh, be quiet.

1:06:23.080 --> 1:06:25.190
- We're all very upset.

1:06:26.380 --> 1:06:27.210
- "Blanche".

1:06:31.230 --> 1:06:32.060
What happened?

1:06:48.210 --> 1:06:51.940
- The house is nothing like this.

1:06:54.080 --> 1:06:55.160
It feels rotten.

1:06:56.480 --> 1:06:57.420
It's broken.

1:06:58.430 --> 1:07:01.850
It's stinks of distrust and secrets

1:07:01.900 --> 1:07:03.570
and dirty little corners.

1:07:06.750 --> 1:07:09.080
The good at this house is crumpled.

1:07:10.160 --> 1:07:15.160
It's turned to dust, turned to
ashes along with Nana Lottie,

1:07:15.810 --> 1:07:20.230
and you have taken away
its purity, its innocence,

1:07:20.280 --> 1:07:22.630
and her beautiful, naive spirit.

1:07:24.510 --> 1:07:26.020
She wasn't at Claire's, mum.

1:07:32.880 --> 1:07:33.660
- I have an update

1:07:33.710 --> 1:07:34.670
regarding her role.

1:07:34.720 --> 1:07:37.640
- Yeah, I'm afraid she's
in a meeting right now.

1:07:37.690 --> 1:07:39.200
I can give her the bad news.

1:07:40.500 --> 1:07:42.600
- I don't know what all the fuss is about.

1:07:42.650 --> 1:07:44.250
I could have it fixed like that.

1:07:46.820 --> 1:07:47.650
- You tell him.

1:07:48.630 --> 1:07:52.990
- Now listen here, we are very unsatisfied

1:07:53.040 --> 1:07:54.760
with your so-called results.

1:07:56.030 --> 1:07:59.290
You better leave her and all
of us alone before I sue you.

1:08:01.110 --> 1:08:04.510
- And before I kick this in
your sad, pathetic little balls!

1:08:05.560 --> 1:08:06.400
- The fuck?

1:08:07.650 --> 1:08:09.490
- Nana, you got the part!

1:08:09.540 --> 1:08:11.580
Congratulations, mum.

1:08:11.630 --> 1:08:13.800
- My little superstar!

1:08:16.790 --> 1:08:17.620
Well done.

1:08:19.310 --> 1:08:20.700
- Congratulations.

1:08:23.640 --> 1:08:27.420
Our very own Blanche Deboise.

1:08:27.470 --> 1:08:28.440
- It's DuBois.

1:08:30.380 --> 1:08:31.880
What are you still doing here?

1:08:41.200 --> 1:08:43.700
- You're all fucking amateurs!

1:09:18.540 --> 1:09:19.540
- I'm sorry.

1:09:22.190 --> 1:09:23.020
I'm sorry.

1:09:25.240 --> 1:09:28.650
It's all ruined.

1:09:43.560 --> 1:09:45.160
- So this is where she puts you.

1:09:46.150 --> 1:09:47.650
- What?

1:09:47.700 --> 1:09:48.680
- I'm curious...

1:09:51.040 --> 1:09:54.060
Do you get off on the image of
your woman with another man?

1:09:54.110 --> 1:09:55.010
- Repeat that?

1:09:55.850 --> 1:09:56.630
- Why haven't you

1:09:56.680 --> 1:09:57.520
hit me already?

1:09:58.620 --> 1:10:00.600
- I'm not usually a violent man.

1:10:01.490 --> 1:10:02.320
- That's cute.

1:10:03.290 --> 1:10:05.130
I bet she loves that about you.

1:10:11.320 --> 1:10:15.760
You know, I'm not the
one that came onto her.

1:10:18.510 --> 1:10:19.340
- Daddy.

1:10:20.400 --> 1:10:21.500
- You're not worth it.

1:10:25.890 --> 1:10:26.890
- Excuse me, ladies.

1:10:57.120 --> 1:10:59.180
We're both
guilty of this, Nadine.

1:10:59.230 --> 1:11:02.030
That bastard took her there on our dime.

1:11:09.950 --> 1:11:11.000
- Come here, sweetie.

1:11:13.370 --> 1:11:14.210
Come here.

1:11:20.860 --> 1:11:25.460
I had no idea just how lost you were.

1:11:25.510 --> 1:11:27.230
You should have come to me.

1:11:28.740 --> 1:11:30.120
I am your mother.

1:11:31.290 --> 1:11:32.640
I'll always be here.

1:11:39.770 --> 1:11:41.320
- Do you think you can hurt me?

1:11:42.530 --> 1:11:45.080
Do you think you're daddy's little hero?

1:11:45.130 --> 1:11:46.130
- I'm a tough girl.

1:11:47.650 --> 1:11:50.070
Don't touch her, or my mother!

1:12:56.890 --> 1:13:00.300
I didn't
want to wake her. Is that okay?

1:13:00.350 --> 1:13:01.350
- Of course.

1:13:07.400 --> 1:13:08.650
Can I sit down?

1:13:11.440 --> 1:13:13.140
- Nana Lottie's cure for sunburns.

1:13:17.520 --> 1:13:18.460
- Here.

1:13:18.510 --> 1:13:20.520
Let me do it for you.

1:13:20.570 --> 1:13:21.490
I'll help.

1:13:39.730 --> 1:13:43.140
Mum? I think...

1:13:44.500 --> 1:13:48.780
- It would be a good idea
to go to the dermatologist.

1:13:49.940 --> 1:13:50.770
- Thank you.

1:13:51.790 --> 1:13:53.960
What happened to you knee?

1:13:56.850 --> 1:14:00.810
- The gynecologist, sorry.

1:14:00.860 --> 1:14:01.690
- What?

1:14:03.290 --> 1:14:06.950
Marielle, are you pregnant?

1:14:07.000 --> 1:14:09.230
Mum no!

1:14:09.280 --> 1:14:13.430
- It's just, I mean, you know,

1:14:13.480 --> 1:14:16.070
since I'm starting university this year.

1:14:19.340 --> 1:14:20.360
- Are you mad at me?

1:14:26.390 --> 1:14:27.170
- This is why

1:14:27.220 --> 1:14:29.100
we don't trust guys like that, Nadine.

1:14:30.870 --> 1:14:34.200
He's been with our 18 year
old daughter, for God's sakes.

1:14:34.250 --> 1:14:35.470
- I'm glad you can count.

1:14:35.520 --> 1:14:38.170
- Oh, do you think this is a joke?

1:14:38.220 --> 1:14:39.300
- I'll fix it.

1:14:39.350 --> 1:14:40.130
- How?

1:14:40.180 --> 1:14:42.630
- Well, I spend time with her

1:14:42.680 --> 1:14:45.900
and work hard for the family
with the bed and breakfast.

1:14:45.950 --> 1:14:47.070
- Bullshit.

1:14:47.120 --> 1:14:48.240
- Excuse me?

1:14:48.290 --> 1:14:49.680
- Well, now that you're gonna

1:14:49.730 --> 1:14:52.270
in the theater, you're gonna
forget about this BnB idea.

1:14:52.320 --> 1:14:53.910
It will never work.

1:14:59.160 --> 1:15:00.950
- What was that for?

1:15:01.000 --> 1:15:02.980
This is not the right timing.

1:15:04.260 --> 1:15:05.120
- I don't know.

1:15:06.120 --> 1:15:09.370
I think there was a hidden
compliment in there somewhere.

1:15:12.980 --> 1:15:13.810
Let's go, love.

1:15:17.170 --> 1:15:20.750
- Ada, you know I love you so much.

1:15:24.240 --> 1:15:29.240
You and daddy are gonna have a blast the
rest of the summer and then you're gonna

1:15:29.960 --> 1:15:31.710
be a big girl for me like

1:15:31.760 --> 1:15:32.810
we talked about.

1:15:38.160 --> 1:15:39.190
I'll miss you.

1:15:40.750 --> 1:15:41.650
I have to do this.

1:15:50.200 --> 1:15:51.150
- I'm proud of you.

1:15:54.300 --> 1:15:55.850
Ada, see you, bud.

1:15:56.870 --> 1:15:57.650
Come on.

1:15:57.700 --> 1:15:58.780
- Where are you going?

1:16:00.640 --> 1:16:01.660
- For a ride around.

1:16:02.860 --> 1:16:03.760
- Marielle, don't.

1:16:04.940 --> 1:16:06.490
- Adrienne, trust me.

1:16:07.710 --> 1:16:09.260
I have to do this.

1:16:47.160 --> 1:16:49.300
Is this where you live?

1:16:49.350 --> 1:16:52.020
This isn't a good idea.

1:16:53.610 --> 1:16:55.220
- Are you...

1:16:55.270 --> 1:16:56.060
homeless?

1:16:56.110 --> 1:16:57.610
- Get out of here!

1:16:59.640 --> 1:17:01.400
- You have our blanket.

1:17:25.640 --> 1:17:27.750
The stillness is misleading.

1:17:27.800 --> 1:17:30.380
Those intimate, beautiful mornings were

1:17:32.440 --> 1:17:35.570
misleading. I needed to know for sure
that it meant nothing.

1:17:40.730 --> 1:17:41.910
I hurt the people who

1:17:41.960 --> 1:17:43.450
love me so I wanted to get hurt.

1:17:44.950 --> 1:17:46.710
Even after everything they have

1:17:46.760 --> 1:17:47.690
forgiven me.

1:17:49.810 --> 1:17:51.920
Just like that. I need to do right by them.

1:19:09.410 --> 1:19:10.490
I'm home now.

1:19:20.910 --> 1:19:22.600
- Where'd you learn to do that?

1:19:23.670 --> 1:19:27.490
- Just a couple of easy tricks
I learned from a stranger.

1:19:48.870 --> 1:19:52.290
“...Returning home as a French belle
Back in England, I sing farewell”

1:21:28.020 --> 1:21:30.080
- You sure you don't
want me to come with you?

1:21:30.130 --> 1:21:31.130
- No, maman.

1:21:31.180 --> 1:21:32.650
You have the BnB now.

1:21:32.700 --> 1:21:33.800
You have to stay here.

1:21:34.890 --> 1:21:36.480
I'm going to be really happy.

1:21:36.530 --> 1:21:37.930
- I want to know everything.

1:21:38.980 --> 1:21:40.160
All the photos you take,

1:21:40.210 --> 1:21:42.310
even the bad ones, you send to me, okay?

1:21:42.360 --> 1:21:43.490
- I will, maman.
