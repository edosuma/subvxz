14:06.101 --> 14:10.856
<i>Clearly out-of-body experience interferes</i>

<i>And dreams of flying,

14:13.567 --> 14:16.570
<i>Surrounds me,

14:16.570 --> 14:18.447
<i>I caught your radio waves</i>

14:19.448 --> 14:20.950
<i>I caught your radio waves</i>

14:21.951 --> 14:25.204
<i>With a tin can and string</i>

14:25.204 --> 14:30.793
<i>Say you string me along</i>

<i>tranquil music</i>

16:11.894 --> 16:13.604
You missed the blessing.

16:13.604 --> 16:15.439
I figured you had it covered.

16:15.439 --> 16:17.733
<i>Would've been better
if you could've been there.</i>

16:18.942 --> 16:21.820
<i>The tea, it's just a symbol.</i>

16:21.820 --> 16:24.156
<i>Of what, exactly?</i>

16:24.156 --> 16:27.826
<i>Of not being so closed off.</i>

16:27.826 --> 16:29.578
<i>Thinking you know everything.</i>

16:31.205 --> 16:33.749
<i>I'm sorry. She-she goes
all witch doctor messiah,</i>

16:33.749 --> 16:35.918
<i>and I'm the one
that's not being humble?</i>

16:35.918 --> 16:37.878
<i>I was talking about myself.</i>

16:37.878 --> 16:41.256

16:48.931 --> 16:51.767
<i>Everyone has their role. Okay?</i>

16:51.767 --> 16:54.436
<i>We're gonna need
more than just food</i>

16:54.436 --> 16:56.271
<i>if we're gonna make it
through this winter.</i>

16:56.271 --> 16:58.816

did she put that in your head?</i>

16:58.816 --> 17:01.527
<i>I...
-</i>

17:01.527 --> 17:05.239
<i>Hey, come on.
No, we're going this way.</i>

17:05.239 --> 17:07.908
<i>The wind's blowing that way.</i>

17:07.908 --> 17:09.993

17:24.341 --> 17:26.927
<i>I'll figure something.</i>

17:28.679 --> 17:31.056
<i>Fine, if you want to go
that way, then go that way,</i>

17:31.056 --> 17:32.724
<i>but...</i>

17:32.724 --> 17:35.144
<i>You know, we need a plan

17:38.689 --> 17:42.568
<i>When the sun hits that peak,</i>

17:42.568 --> 17:45.863
<i>we'll meet back in the clearing
near that weird mossy tree.</i>

17:47.281 --> 17:49.074
<i>Okay?</i>

17:51.034 --> 17:53.287
<i>See you later.
Good luck.</i>

18:08.844 --> 18:10.762
<i>Last I heard,
you were finger painting</i>

18:10.762 --> 18:13.807
<i>in the loony bin,
and now you're running a cult.</i>

18:13.807 --> 18:15.767
<i>Clearly you've recovered, then.</i>

18:15.767 --> 18:18.270
<i>Last I heard,
you were getting out of rehab</i>

18:18.270 --> 18:20.147
<i>for the fifth time.</i>

18:20.147 --> 18:22.232
<i>How's your recovery going?</i>

18:23.233 --> 18:25.068
<i>We're not a cult.</i>

18:25.068 --> 18:29.448
<i>We are an intentional community
turning suffering into strength.</i>

18:29.448 --> 18:31.450
<i>So we can live
as our best selves.</i>

18:31.450 --> 18:33.327
<i>You fucking kidnapped me, Lottie.</i>

18:33.327 --> 18:35.162
<i>That was not the plan.</i>

18:35.162 --> 18:38.373
<i>Oh, and what about the guy you
were burying alive in the woods?</i>

18:38.373 --> 18:41.376
<i>A therapeutic treatment.
One of many we offer here.</i>

18:41.376 --> 18:43.629
<i>Oh. Was I being treated</i>

18:43.629 --> 18:45.714
<i>when your purple fucks
came and jumped me?</i>

18:45.714 --> 18:47.799

<i>Wow, deep.</i>

18:54.973 --> 18:57.392
<i>After Travis died,</i>

18:57.392 --> 19:01.897
<i>I was worried that
you would do something stupid.</i>

19:01.897 --> 19:04.608
<i>So I sent my friends
to keep an eye on you,</i>

19:04.608 --> 19:08.987
<i>and, surprise,
you stuck a gun in your mouth.</i>

19:08.987 --> 19:12.115
<i>They had to act fast.</i>

19:12.115 --> 19:14.493
<i>You're welcome, by the way.</i>

19:15.869 --> 19:18.038
<i>Charlotte.
- Ah.</i>

19:22.668 --> 19:24.711
<i>I smell butterscotch.</i>

19:24.711 --> 19:26.880
<i>Did you... did you put
maca root in here?</i>

19:26.880 --> 19:29.883
<i>Hmm. I asked for ashwagandha.</i>

19:29.883 --> 19:32.261
<i>I want my focus increased,
not my libido.</i>

19:32.261 --> 19:34.972
<i>I'm sorry, Charlotte.
Um, I must have mixed it up.</i>

19:34.972 --> 19:37.057
<i>I-I can go down
and make you another one.</i>

19:37.057 --> 19:38.725
<i>It's all right.</i>

19:38.725 --> 19:39.977
<i>I'll drink it.</i>

19:39.977 --> 19:41.103
<i>I mean,
it can't hurt, right?</i>

19:42.688 --> 19:45.232
<i>Sorry about your hand.</i>

19:48.318 --> 19:49.945
<i>Mmm.</i>

19:49.945 --> 19:51.863
<i>Is that her best self?</i>

19:51.863 --> 19:54.199
<i>Don't be an asshole.</i>

19:54.199 --> 19:55.951
<i>You could have blinded her.</i>

20:05.919 --> 20:07.796
<i>Hey, hi.</i>

20:07.796 --> 20:09.298
<i>How was Ilana's?</i>

20:11.967 --> 20:14.970
<i>I'm so sorry,
I don't speak grunt.</i>

20:14.970 --> 20:16.930
<i>Was that like a...</i>

20:16.930 --> 20:19.808
<i>"what a dumb question"
kind of grunt, or...</i>

20:19.808 --> 20:21.977
<i>oh, my God,
are you choking on something?</i>

20:21.977 --> 20:23.812
<i>Do you need me
to perform the Heimlich, or...</i>

20:23.812 --> 20:25.355
<i>It was fine.</i>

20:25.355 --> 20:27.107
<i>Well, thank God for that. Right?</i>

20:31.069 --> 20:34.823
<i>So, your dad's tied up
at the store.</i>

20:34.823 --> 20:37.117
<i>Do you want to, like,
hit the mall</i>

20:37.117 --> 20:38.827
<i>and try to rack up
the credit card debt?</i>

20:38.827 --> 20:41.163
Make him work even harder?

20:41.163 --> 20:42.956
<i>No, thanks.</i>

20:44.499 --> 20:46.001
<i>We could just go
for a walk instead.</i>

20:46.001 --> 20:48.503
<i>I'm going out with Kyle, okay?
- Sorry.</i>

20:49.504 --> 20:51.423

20:53.550 --> 20:56.011
<i>You're growing up and...</i>

20:59.222 --> 21:02.184
<i>Yeah. Right.</i>

21:16.323 --> 21:18.700
<i>Tai, guess who.</i>

21:18.700 --> 21:21.036
<i>It's Misty. Again.</i>

21:21.036 --> 21:23.038
<i>Third time today actually.</i>

21:23.038 --> 21:24.873
<i>What is up with you and Shauna,
anyway?</i>

21:24.873 --> 21:26.208
<i>What are you guys having, like,</i>

21:26.208 --> 21:28.085
<i>a spa day without me
or something?</i>

21:28.085 --> 21:32.339
<i>But seriously, I have evidence
that Nat has met with foul play,</i>

21:32.339 --> 21:35.884
<i>so I could really use
the support of my teammates.</i>

<i>What's going on?
- What is happening?</i>

23:04.764 --> 23:06.099
<i>Fucking told you
that it wasn't okay!</i>

23:06.099 --> 23:07.267
<i>I knew it wasn't all right.</i>

23:07.267 --> 23:08.310
<i>What?</i>

23:08.310 --> 23:09.978
<i>Go on, Shauna, tell them.</i>

23:11.438 --> 23:14.316
<i>Tell them what
you've been up to with Jackie.</i>

braiding Jackie's hair.</i>

her fucking makeup.</i>

23:22.073 --> 23:23.408
<i>Holy Christ.</i>

23:23.408 --> 23:25.744
<i>And you've been posing her,
right?</i>

23:25.744 --> 23:29.331
<i>Adjusting her limbs
like some fucked-up doll.</i>

23:29.331 --> 23:30.832

23:30.832 --> 23:32.167
<i>Is that healthy?
- It's okay.</i>

23:32.167 --> 23:33.668

26:37.602 --> 26:39.479
<i>Mm. Unfortunately,</i>

26:39.479 --> 26:41.856
<i>he turned
into kind of an asshole.</i>

- Oh.</i>

<i>I've seen

<i>Actually, the opposite.</i>

28:09.486 --> 28:11.613
<i>I did it to protect your dad.</i>

28:11.613 --> 28:14.449
<i>He's been through so much.</i>

28:14.449 --> 28:16.951
<i>The last thing he needs
is everyone...</i>

28:16.951 --> 28:19.037
<i>knowing that I cheated on him.</i>

28:19.037 --> 28:20.955
<i>Wow.</i>

28:20.955 --> 28:23.333
<i>How thoughtful of you.</i>

28:23.333 --> 28:25.210
<i>Callie.</i>

28:25.210 --> 28:27.796
<i>Cals?</i>

28:30.882 --> 28:33.802
<i>At least go through the back
in case he's still out there.</i>

28:46.189 --> 28:47.982
<i>He's so cute, Mom.</i>

28:47.982 --> 28:49.943
<i>Sammy.</i>

28:49.943 --> 28:52.153
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

28:52.153 --> 28:53.780
<i>I wanted to see you.</i>

28:53.780 --> 28:56.658
<i>But you-you walked
all the way from school?</i>

28:56.658 --> 28:58.076
<i>Yeah.</i>

28:58.076 --> 29:01.704
<i>Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.</i>

29:01.704 --> 29:03.414


29:05.250 --> 29:07.919
<i>Does your mom know you're here?</i>

29:07.919 --> 29:09.045
<i>No.</i>

29:09.045 --> 29:10.964
<i>Hmm. Right.</i>

29:10.964 --> 29:13.424
<i>Okay, um, why don't you</i>

29:13.424 --> 29:15.468
<i>go play with Steve.
- Mm-hmm.</i>

29:15.468 --> 29:18.847
<i>And I will make you
a snack, okay?</i>

29:18.847 --> 29:21.266
<i>And give your mom a call.</i>

29:26.187 --> 29:27.730
<i>What do you want?</i>

29:27.730 --> 29:29.816
<i>Don't overreact.</i>

29:29.816 --> 29:31.150
<i>What is it now, Taissa?</i>

29:31.150 --> 29:32.443
<i>Sammy's here.</i>

29:32.443 --> 29:33.486
<i>What?</i>

29:33.486 --> 29:35.196
<i>He walked here after school.</i>

29:35.196 --> 29:36.906
<i>I had nothing to do with it.</i>

29:36.906 --> 29:39.450
<i>Oh, sure.
Nothing to do with it, huh?</i>

29:39.450 --> 29:41.077
<i>I didn't! He just showed up.</i>

29:41.077 --> 29:43.204
<i>Goddamn it,
I'm coming to get him.</i>

29:55.508 --> 29:58.553
<i>I see, so mainly
hypochlorite cleaning supplies.</i>

29:58.553 --> 30:01.180
<i>May I ask
about your HVAC protocols?</i>

30:01.180 --> 30:03.182
Excuse me?

30:03.182 --> 30:04.851
<i>How often
do you change the filters?</i>

30:04.851 --> 30:06.394
<i>Since you're so close
to the highway,</i>

30:06.394 --> 30:08.396
<i>I assume particulate matter
is an issue.</i>

30:08.396 --> 30:10.523
<i>I won't subject
my mother to AQIs</i>

30:10.523 --> 30:12.233
<i>over 35.</i>

30:12.233 --> 30:14.235
<i>Excellent question, sir.
I'll check with Maintenance,</i>

30:14.235 --> 30:15.695
<i>and let you know.</i>

30:15.695 --> 30:17.697
And what about your staff?

30:17.697 --> 30:19.574
<i>We've all heard
the horror stories.</i>

30:19.574 --> 30:22.368
<i>Phone-it-in nurses.
The all-too-common sadist.</i>

30:22.368 --> 30:25.288
<i>I assume you run Live Scan
clearances on all your hires?</i>

30:25.288 --> 30:27.081
I can assure, our caregivers

30:27.081 --> 30:29.375
<i>are the very best of the best.</i>

30:31.294 --> 30:33.630
<i>As for accommodation,
my mother would require</i>

30:33.630 --> 30:36.132
<i>a single occupancy, corner room.</i>

30:36.132 --> 30:38.426
<i>Can you show me the ones
that are available?</i>

<i>Hanging on a branch.</i>

32:14.272 --> 32:16.524
<i>A couple miles back.</i>

32:18.234 --> 32:19.652
<i>Did you-did you look for him?</i>

32:19.652 --> 32:21.279
<i>Everywhere! Everywhere!
- Huh? Did you dig?</i>

32:21.279 --> 32:24.073
<i>Did you dig?!
- I screamed, but nothing.</i>

32:36.961 --> 32:39.756
<i>No. No.
- Hey, come back.</i>

32:39.756 --> 32:42.008
<i>I swear! Hey.</i>

32:42.008 --> 32:44.886
<i>We have to go get him.
- Come on. Come on.</i>

32:44.886 --> 32:47.430
<i>Come on, hey.</i>

32:47.430 --> 32:50.099
<i>Hey. Hey.</i>

33:03.529 --> 33:06.157
<i>Javi's gone.</i>

33:06.157 --> 33:08.201
<i>He's gone.</i>

<i>It's okay.</i>

33:23.633 --> 33:26.177
<i>On the night Travis died,
he called me.</i>

33:26.177 --> 33:28.930
<i>He said the wilderness
had come back</i>

33:28.930 --> 33:30.389
<i>to haunt him.</i>

33:33.976 --> 33:35.603
<i>And he said</i>

33:35.603 --> 33:38.356
<i>he knew what he had to do.</i>

33:38.356 --> 33:40.399
<i>I asked him what he meant,</i>

33:40.399 --> 33:42.443
<i>but he just hung up.</i>

33:42.443 --> 33:44.445
<i>And I panicked.</i>

33:44.445 --> 33:46.489
<i>I drove all night.</i>

33:46.489 --> 33:48.908
<i>And by the time</i>

33:48.908 --> 33:50.576
<i>I found him,</i>

33:50.576 --> 33:52.453
<i>he was a mess.</i>

33:52.453 --> 33:54.580
<i>He was terrified,
he was paranoid.</i>

33:54.580 --> 33:56.290
<i>The only way
to confront the darkness</i>

33:56.290 --> 33:58.042
<i>is to get as close
to death as possible.</i>

33:58.042 --> 34:00.044
<i>When Van almost died,
when you did.</i>

34:00.044 --> 34:01.546
<i>You both said you saw something.</i>

34:01.546 --> 34:03.297
<i>The only way to confront
the darkness to find out</i>

34:03.297 --> 34:05.133
<i>what it wants is to get
as close as possible to death.</i>

34:05.133 --> 34:08.344
<i>Stop reliving this!</i>

34:08.344 --> 34:11.097
<i>You're in the vise grip
of your trauma.</i>

34:31.993 --> 34:34.745
<i>I felt like I had reached him.</i>

34:36.664 --> 34:38.916
<i>I just wish
I'd never fallen asleep.</i>

34:39.500 --> 34:42.253
<i>Oh, you-you don't
think with him like that,</i>

34:42.253 --> 34:44.505
<i>you should have
reached out to me?</i>

34:44.505 --> 34:48.176
<i>You don't think
that I could've helped him?</i>

34:48.176 --> 34:50.344
<i>I asked him that, Nat.</i>

34:52.722 --> 34:55.808
<i>And he said that you would
only make things worse.</i>

34:58.060 --> 35:00.271
<i>suspenseful music</i>

35:05.651 --> 35:09.155
<i>I woke up in the middle of the
night and Travis wasn't there.</i>

35:09.155 --> 35:10.907
<i>He left instructions
of how to get</i>

35:10.907 --> 35:14.368
<i>into his bank account,
and he'd written you that note.</i>

35:17.455 --> 35:20.708
<i>I drove as fast as I could
to the ranch</i>

35:20.708 --> 35:23.211
<i>where he worked. And then...</i>

35:23.211 --> 35:24.962
<i>I found him in the barn.</i>

35:24.962 --> 35:26.631
<i>He had lit candles</i>

35:26.631 --> 35:29.467
<i>around him
in the shape of the symbol.</i>

35:29.467 --> 35:31.135
<i>Travis, what the fuck
are you doing?!</i>

35:31.135 --> 35:32.386
<i>I'm gonna hang myself
until I pass out</i>

35:32.386 --> 35:33.888
<i>so I can talk to it, you know?</i>

35:33.888 --> 35:35.723
<i>He had rigged
his neck to a crane.</i>

35:35.723 --> 35:38.309
<i>Do not press that button.
- If it tells me what it wants,</i>

35:38.309 --> 35:39.977
<i>I can make it go away.</i>

35:39.977 --> 35:42.188
<i>Just a few inches off the
ground, for a couple of minutes.</i>

35:42.188 --> 35:43.856
<i>And how will you get back down?</i>

35:43.856 --> 35:45.233
<i>If you don't help me,
I'm just gonna do it myself.</i>

35:45.233 --> 35:47.151
<i>No.</i>

35:47.151 --> 35:49.153
<i>Fine.</i>

35:50.404 --> 35:52.907
<i>Stop, stop. Okay.</i>

35:57.078 --> 35:59.497
<i>The moment you go unconscious,</i>

35:59.497 --> 36:02.124
<i>I am lowering you back down,
you got it?</i>

36:03.709 --> 36:05.920
<i>Do it.</i>

36:29.360 --> 36:31.612
<i>So that's the story?</i>

36:31.612 --> 36:34.282
<i>That Travis fucking died</i>

36:34.282 --> 36:36.784
<i>because the buttons got stuck?</i>

36:36.784 --> 36:38.369
<i>It was...</i>

36:38.369 --> 36:40.204
<i>a horrendous accident.</i>

36:40.204 --> 36:42.707
<i>I know there's something
you're not telling me.</i>

36:44.500 --> 36:46.627
<i>I swear.</i>

<i>Come on, come on, come on!</i>

<i>Put your faith in him,

<i>No!</i>

37:57.323 --> 37:58.908
<i>I didn't kill him, Nat.</i>

37:58.908 --> 38:01.786
<i>I was trying to save him.</i>

38:01.786 --> 38:04.580
Well, that's funny.

38:04.580 --> 38:07.500
<i>Because every time
that you try to save someone,</i>

38:07.500 --> 38:09.210
<i>a lot of bad shit happens.</i>

38:09.210 --> 38:11.212
<i>And look at you now,
25 years later,</i>

38:11.212 --> 38:14.298
<i>and the same shit's
happening again.</i>

38:14.298 --> 38:17.093
<i>Only this time,
you're wearing a Rolex.</i>

38:17.093 --> 38:19.637
<i>And you have all the broken toys</i>

38:19.637 --> 38:22.390
<i>around here who think
you walk on water.</i>

38:24.350 --> 38:25.851
<i>I'm gonna put a stop</i>

38:25.851 --> 38:27.853
<i>to your fucking bullshit.
I don't know how yet,</i>

38:27.853 --> 38:30.606
<i>but I'm gonna stop it.
- Well, at least you'll have</i>

38:30.606 --> 38:33.859
<i>to stay alive to do that,
so it's a-- a win for me.</i>

38:33.859 --> 38:36.153
<i>Take me to the train station!</i>

38:36.153 --> 38:38.155
<i>Or however
somebody gets out of here,</i>

38:38.155 --> 38:39.865
<i>back to civilization!</i>

38:39.865 --> 38:41.534
<i>Well, I'm afraid
it's-it's too late.</i>

38:41.534 --> 38:43.828
<i>You'll have to spend
the night here.</i>

38:43.828 --> 38:46.914
<i>So you're plan
for my destruction?</i>

38:46.914 --> 38:50.334
<i>It will have to wait
until you're rested.</i>

39:03.013 --> 39:04.682
<i>What the fuck?</i>

39:04.682 --> 39:06.016
<i>Tai?</i>

39:06.976 --> 39:08.561
<i>Tai?
- Mm.</i>

39:11.772 --> 39:14.024
<i>Tai!</i>

<i>God, fucking...</i>

39:16.026 --> 39:18.279
<i>Taissa?</i>

39:18.279 --> 39:21.157
<i>I'm coming.</i>

39:21.157 --> 39:23.492
<i>Just hold on.
- What the fuck?</i>

39:23.492 --> 39:25.286
<i>You knew I was coming,
and you chain the door?</i>

39:25.286 --> 39:27.997
<i>I'm sorry. I must've
done it without thinking.</i>

39:30.916 --> 39:33.169
<i>What?</i>

39:33.169 --> 39:36.297
<i>You just--
you look like hammered shit.</i>

39:36.297 --> 39:38.507
<i>Cool, thanks, Monni.</i>

39:38.507 --> 39:41.093
<i>It's nice to hear from you.
- Where's Sammy?</i>

39:41.093 --> 39:43.012
<i>Playing with the dog.
- Sam?</i>

39:49.852 --> 39:52.438
<i>Okay, I guess
he went up to his room.</i>

39:52.438 --> 39:54.315
<i>I don't-- Come on.</i>

39:54.315 --> 39:55.900
<i>You know, I didn't plan this.</i>

39:55.900 --> 39:57.985
<i>Simone, come on.
- Sammy!</i>

39:59.737 --> 40:01.822
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

40:03.199 --> 40:04.783
<i>Oh, fuck. I'm so--</i>

40:04.783 --> 40:06.827
<i>It must be a cry for attention.</i>

40:06.827 --> 40:07.912
<i>Like, with us fighting...</i>

40:07.912 --> 40:09.497
<i>So, you left him by himself?</i>

40:09.497 --> 40:11.665
<i>Let's go find our son.</i>

40:28.557 --> 40:30.059
Fuck.

<i>God.</i>

40:45.032 --> 40:47.409
<i>Should we save her clothes?</i>

40:48.744 --> 40:50.746
<i>You want to strip her naked?</i>

40:50.746 --> 40:52.998
<i>I mean, her jacket, mostly.</i>

40:52.998 --> 40:55.334
<i>It seems a shame to waste it.</i>

40:55.334 --> 40:57.920
<i>No one is taking
Jackie's jacket.</i>

40:59.004 --> 41:01.173
<i>Shauna, it's worth talking about.</i>

41:01.173 --> 41:03.384
<i>No! Okay, we're not
fucking debating</i>

41:03.384 --> 41:05.177
<i>whether Jackie gets
to keep her clothes.</i>

41:05.177 --> 41:07.388
<i>It's not like she needs them.
- Stop!</i>

41:07.388 --> 41:09.890
<i>Oh, now you're her protector?
Too little too late.</i>

41:09.890 --> 41:11.892
<i>Fuck you, Mari! Fuck you!
-</i>

41:11.892 --> 41:14.144
<i>Hey! Everyone, stop!</i>

41:18.607 --> 41:20.734

what he did? [chuckles]</i>

42:31.680 --> 42:34.308
<i>That guy
has so been checking you out.</i>

42:34.308 --> 42:36.310
<i>You should flirt with him
and go back to his place.</i>

42:37.895 --> 42:38.979
<i>All right.</i>

42:39.897 --> 42:41.106
<i>I'm joking.</i>

42:41.106 --> 42:42.316
<i>Why not?</i>

<i>Because he could be a psycho.</i>

42:54.995 --> 42:56.413
<i>Yeah?</i>

42:57.373 --> 42:58.999
<i>Well, is he around?</i>

42:58.999 --> 43:01.794

you owe me a drink.</i>

43:32.700 --> 43:34.702
<i>why are you day drinking?</i>

43:34.702 --> 43:37.538
<i>I'm a fighter pilot by night.</i>

43:37.538 --> 43:39.039
<i>I love you</i>

43:39.039 --> 43:41.375
<i>I'm pretty sure you're lying.</i>

43:42.251 --> 43:44.253
<i>Oh, shit. "Ceramic."</i>

43:45.754 --> 43:46.714
<i>What?</i>

43:46.714 --> 43:48.549
<i>I just read the hint.</i>

43:48.549 --> 43:50.551
<i>"Ceramic."</i>

43:50.551 --> 43:54.596
<i>Now you have to answer
my question.</i>

43:54.596 --> 43:56.598
<i>Well, okay.</i>

43:56.598 --> 43:58.559
<i>But only because
you're a genius.</i>

44:01.395 --> 44:02.521
Um,

44:02.521 --> 44:04.231
<i>I live in Brooklyn.</i>

44:04.231 --> 44:06.817
<i>But, um, I grew up here.</i>

44:06.817 --> 44:08.569
<i>And...</i>

44:08.569 --> 44:10.696
<i>you know, my parents, after...</i>

44:10.696 --> 44:13.365
<i>26 years
of a messed-up marriage,</i>

44:13.365 --> 44:15.534
<i>my mom's finally had it.</i>

44:15.534 --> 44:17.202
<i>She's moving out,</i>

44:17.202 --> 44:19.371
<i>and I'm helping.</i>

44:19.371 --> 44:21.874
<i>You've got to be kidding.</i>

44:21.874 --> 44:24.084
<i>Yep, said that to be funny.</i>

44:24.084 --> 44:25.419
<i>No, I mean...</i>

44:25.419 --> 44:26.754
<i>I'm...</i>

44:27.337 --> 44:30.591
<i>I'm-I'm just...
I'm kind of in the same boat.</i>

44:32.092 --> 44:35.929
<i>Yeah, I'm-I'm in my last year
at Rutgers,</i>

44:35.929 --> 44:40.100
<i>but I had to take
the semester off.</i>

44:40.100 --> 44:41.602
<i>My mom's...</i>

44:41.602 --> 44:44.605
<i>cheating on my dad.
It's a whole thing.</i>

44:44.605 --> 44:46.023
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

44:46.023 --> 44:47.274
<i>It's tough.</i>

44:49.276 --> 44:50.944
<i>I love you</i>

44:50.944 --> 44:53.238
<i>But, hey,</i>

44:53.238 --> 44:55.282
<i>we're okay, right?</i>

44:55.282 --> 44:58.076
<i>Come on, it's not like we're in
some dive bar getting day drunk,</i>

44:58.076 --> 44:59.745
<i>spilling our guts to strangers.</i>

45:00.746 --> 45:02.331
<i>Exactly.</i>

45:03.290 --> 45:04.958
<i>I'm Callie.</i>

45:06.126 --> 45:07.461
<i>Jay.</i>

45:21.934 --> 45:24.353
<i>What the fuck is going on?</i>

45:24.353 --> 45:26.104
<i>What did you do to her face?</i>

45:26.104 --> 45:28.232
<i>We decided
it was time to move on.</i>

45:32.152 --> 45:34.947
<i>This has been a fucking day.</i>

45:34.947 --> 45:37.491
<i>Wait, are those Javi's?</i>

45:38.700 --> 45:40.077
<i>No.</i>

45:40.077 --> 45:41.078
<i>Can't be.</i>

45:41.078 --> 45:42.496
<i>Not another word.</i>

45:42.496 --> 45:44.498
<i>No, Javi's alive.
I can feel it.</i>

45:44.498 --> 45:47.334
<i>For fuck's sake, shut up!</i>

45:47.334 --> 45:49.586
<i>Don't you see
how much damage you are doing?</i>

45:51.046 --> 45:52.297
<i>Why? Lottie, why?</i>

45:52.297 --> 45:55.008
<i>What is making you
fucking do this?</i>

45:55.008 --> 45:56.093
<i>You can't just keep making him--</i>

46:06.270 --> 46:10.315
<i>soft, somber music</i>

46:17.823 --> 46:19.825
<i>Jackie.</i>

46:23.495 --> 46:26.081
<i>I'll never have another friend
like you.</i>

46:28.542 --> 46:32.588
<i>I don't even know where you end
and I begin.</i>

46:34.840 --> 46:36.216
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

46:37.175 --> 46:39.219
<i>And I love you.</i>

47:22.763 --> 47:24.139
Goodbye, Javi.

47:59.549 --> 48:02.094
<i>soft, eerie music</i>

48:47.889 --> 48:50.142
<i>All right.</i>

48:50.142 --> 48:51.727
<i>It's time
for some fresh sheets, baby.</i>

48:55.897 --> 48:57.441
<i>Oh.</i>

48:59.067 --> 49:01.278
<i>Duh.</i>

49:03.071 --> 49:05.365
<i>I have no doubt
you're reading this note,</i>

49:05.365 --> 49:07.451
<i>because you're too smart
not to have figured it out.</i>

49:07.451 --> 49:09.369
<i>Damn right I am.</i>

49:09.369 --> 49:11.413
<i>Don't shoot the messenger, but
the security camera is a dummy,</i>

49:11.413 --> 49:12.789
<i>for deterrence only.</i>

49:12.789 --> 49:14.624
<i>However, I did I.D. a man</i>

49:14.624 --> 49:17.127
<i>who's been living at the motel
for three months.</i>

49:17.127 --> 49:18.962
<i>He thinks
he's being interrogated</i>

49:18.962 --> 49:21.757
<i>by the FBI tomorrow
at 1100 hours.</i>

49:21.757 --> 49:24.134

<i>of your choosing.</i>

49:27.262 --> 49:29.389
<i>This note

<i>nine...</i>

49:30.932 --> 49:32.851
<i>Never mind, I'm kidding.</i>

49:32.851 --> 49:35.437
<i>Truly yours, PuttingtheSickinForensics.</i>

49:41.443 --> 49:43.236
<i>My liege.</i>

49:44.196 --> 49:45.363
<i>I don't do coffee late.</i>

49:45.363 --> 49:48.283
<i>Oh, God.
I'm such a bad listener.</i>

49:49.576 --> 49:52.329
<i>So, I followed the daughter</i>

49:52.329 --> 49:55.916
<i>and spent two hours with her
at a bar.</i>

49:57.125 --> 49:58.251
<i>Okay, relax.</i>

49:58.251 --> 50:00.003
<i>I was a gentleman.</i>

50:00.003 --> 50:01.713
<i>That's not funny, Matt.</i>

50:01.713 --> 50:03.215
<i>And what the fuck?</i>

50:03.215 --> 50:04.591
<i>We're not undercover on this.
- Okay, well,</i>

50:04.591 --> 50:05.926
<i>unofficially undercover.</i>

50:05.926 --> 50:07.552
<i>And wait for it...</i>

50:07.552 --> 50:09.387
<i>Ms. Sadecki
was cheating on her husband.</i>

50:09.387 --> 50:11.556
<i>The daughter just confirmed.</i>

50:11.556 --> 50:14.601
<i>What is the over-under on
the boyfriend being Adam Martin?</i>

50:14.601 --> 50:16.853
<i>Kevyn, we could bring her in
right now.</i>

50:16.853 --> 50:18.522
<i>Go hard.
- What? N-No.</i>

50:18.522 --> 50:21.441
<i>No, I still say we wait, okay?</i>

50:22.317 --> 50:24.111
<i>Shauna's smart.</i>

50:24.111 --> 50:25.779
<i>We're gonna need more.</i>

50:28.365 --> 50:30.408
<i>What? What?
-</i>

50:30.408 --> 50:31.409
<i>What do you mean, "what?"</i>

50:31.409 --> 50:33.453
<i>Look.</i>

50:33.453 --> 50:34.955
<i>Went to high school with her.</i>

50:34.955 --> 50:36.748
<i>The whole plane crash thing.</i>

50:37.666 --> 50:39.126

<i>You've been on the job,
what, a year?</i>

50:44.256 --> 50:46.591
<i>Just... slow down, okay?</i>

50:46.591 --> 50:49.052
<i>Or you're gonna
royally fuck this up.</i>

50:50.220 --> 50:52.556
<i>Okay. Okay.
- Okay?</i>
