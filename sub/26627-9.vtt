WEBVTT

00:26.860 --> 00:29.904
[Lantom] That's $80.
Unless you want to go double or nothing.

00:29.988 --> 00:32.198
-[man] You hustling me, grandpa?
-[Lantom] You tell me.

00:32.282 --> 00:33.908
[Matt] Did you know, Father?

00:36.411 --> 00:37.787
Matthew? What are you doing here?

00:37.871 --> 00:39.330
Did you know she was my mother?

00:41.166 --> 00:42.542
[sighs]

00:45.462 --> 00:46.463
Yeah. You knew.

00:51.301 --> 00:52.886
I couldn't tell you. Even when I wanted to.

00:56.222 --> 00:58.224
Don't hide behind your collar, Father.

00:58.308 --> 01:01.478
-Wait. You're a priest?
-Take your money and go.

01:05.940 --> 01:07.484
I'm not hiding, Matthew.

01:08.526 --> 01:09.986
-I'm right here.
-You...

01:12.572 --> 01:13.990
of all people...

01:16.201 --> 01:18.536
All those times
I looked to you for guidance.

01:20.872 --> 01:22.373
You saw me struggling...

01:24.042 --> 01:28.046
and you chose to hide the one thing
that could have changed everything for me.

01:30.507 --> 01:35.386
Please, Father, help me understand
why you would do that.

01:37.347 --> 01:42.560
I prayed for Maggie to find it in herself
to tell you years ago.

01:42.644 --> 01:47.315
She couldn't find it in herself
to walk nine blocks to visit me as a kid.

01:48.191 --> 01:52.987
Or to comfort me when my father
was murdered and I thought that...

01:53.863 --> 01:57.909
I knew that I was alone in this world.

01:57.992 --> 01:59.536
-You were never alone--
-Yes, I was!

02:01.371 --> 02:02.997
And you let me believe it.

02:05.166 --> 02:08.628
Yes. Yes, we did.

02:10.547 --> 02:11.548
Why?

02:16.010 --> 02:18.179
-What did Maggie say?
-I'm asking you.

02:18.263 --> 02:20.390
Maggie's a good person, Matthew.

02:20.473 --> 02:23.309
Flawed, like us all.

02:24.394 --> 02:26.896
And tortured over decisions she's made.

02:27.772 --> 02:31.359
But she dedicated her life
to making amends.

02:32.610 --> 02:34.612
You still haven't answered the question.

02:35.530 --> 02:37.866
Growing up without your parents, Matthew,

02:39.159 --> 02:41.870
you don't grow to see them as people.

02:43.079 --> 02:44.914
You need to understand that...

02:46.040 --> 02:47.584
to understand her.

02:48.710 --> 02:52.255
[crowd shouting and cheering]

02:55.008 --> 02:57.719
-We should go. This was a stupid idea.
-[girl 2] Definitely. No, we're here.
Let's just give it a minute.

03:05.727 --> 03:08.271
[crowd whistling and cheering]

03:13.693 --> 03:16.487
Three weeks from now,
we're not going anywhere anymore.

03:16.571 --> 03:19.073
-True.
-Just a minute.

03:19.157 --> 03:19.991
[bell dings]

03:26.456 --> 03:28.958
-Hey. [clears throat]
-Me? Yeah, you. Can you give me a hand up here?

03:32.378 --> 03:34.714
-[chuckles] No, I can't.
-Yeah, you got to.

03:34.797 --> 03:37.842
Come on, it's only gonna take me
60 seconds to put this asshole down.

03:37.926 --> 03:39.219
Three minutes, tops.

03:39.302 --> 03:43.348
-Okay, now is a good time to leave.
-Yes, it is. Let's go.

03:43.890 --> 03:44.891
What do you need me to do?

03:44.974 --> 03:46.142
Nothing much.

03:46.226 --> 03:48.895
Just gotta give me some water,
maybe wipe off my face, like that.

03:48.978 --> 03:50.271
Come on.

03:50.355 --> 03:52.857
Maggie, obedience, poverty...

03:53.483 --> 03:54.484
Chastity.

03:54.567 --> 03:56.861
You ever done this before?
You got brothers or something?

03:56.945 --> 03:58.947
No. Never seen a fight before, either.

03:59.030 --> 04:00.031
Shit.

04:00.114 --> 04:01.658
Then why'd you pick me to come up here?

04:01.741 --> 04:04.452
I just figured a nun
wouldn't put something in my bottle.

04:04.535 --> 04:05.495
It's gonna be all right.

04:05.578 --> 04:08.748
You just gotta put my mouth guard
in my teeth at the start of the rounds.

04:08.831 --> 04:11.000
Maybe give me
some water between rounds, too.

04:11.084 --> 04:13.044
I thought you said
you only needed 60 seconds.

04:13.127 --> 04:17.548
Yeah. Well, it's just a backup plan.
You never know.

04:17.632 --> 04:18.716
[bell dings]

04:22.929 --> 04:24.472
[grunting]

04:36.484 --> 04:37.318
[bell dings]

04:37.402 --> 04:39.529
[panting] Water.

04:39.612 --> 04:41.197
Yeah, come on. I only got a minute.

04:43.783 --> 04:45.868
-Can you get that?
-[Maggie] Get that?

04:45.952 --> 04:47.287
-Yeah.
-[Maggie] Oh, yeah.

05:18.026 --> 05:19.777
[thunder rumbling]

05:21.863 --> 05:23.906
[baby crying]

05:41.007 --> 05:42.633
Maggie, what is wrong with you?

05:45.762 --> 05:46.763
Maggie? Maggie.

06:09.452 --> 06:10.453
Maggie.

06:40.525 --> 06:42.985
[Lantom] <i>Damn, I don't know</i>
<i>what I should've done.</i>

06:44.779 --> 06:47.198
I guess that's not really true.

06:48.282 --> 06:50.743
You know, when I heard Maggie
call me her son,

06:51.369 --> 06:56.624
my thought was... my first thought...
was how stupid I'd been.

06:57.500 --> 07:00.128
That it had been right in front of me
for so long.

07:02.672 --> 07:08.094
And then I remembered that it had been
in front of you for even longer.

07:09.303 --> 07:11.055
From-- From the beginning.

07:12.765 --> 07:16.561
We've talked so much about truth...

07:17.728 --> 07:19.147
you and I.

07:19.856 --> 07:23.568
Of my truth, God's truth.

07:28.614 --> 07:33.744
Now it seems like all those conversations
were just a goddamned lie.

07:38.207 --> 07:39.500
Shame on you.

08:08.029 --> 08:09.739
[breathing heavily]

08:25.713 --> 08:28.633
We couldn't do this at the office?
We had to come all the way out here?

08:29.509 --> 08:34.263
Once I explain everything to you
and the SAC, you'll understand, sir.

08:34.347 --> 08:35.723
Shit, I better.

08:43.856 --> 08:46.150
-[Ray] Sorry about this, boss.
-Come in, guys.

08:46.692 --> 08:47.693
[girl] Mom?

08:48.402 --> 08:49.987
[footsteps approaching]

08:50.613 --> 08:53.115
-Where did you put them?
-Give me a sec?

08:53.199 --> 08:54.492
[girl] Like you'd understand.

08:54.575 --> 08:57.203
I understand, Allison. I just don't care.
Now, move it.

08:58.079 --> 09:01.332
-Make sure your dad signs those papers.
-[Allison] I know. I know. Bye, Mom.

09:08.965 --> 09:10.800
[chuckles] At least she talks to you.

09:10.883 --> 09:12.802
I can't pry my girls
away from their phones.

09:12.885 --> 09:14.679
You say that like it's a bad thing.

09:15.555 --> 09:16.556
Sorry about the mess.

09:16.681 --> 09:19.141
My contractor promised
he would be done months ago.

09:19.225 --> 09:22.103
-How do you take it?
-Black is fine, thanks.

09:23.646 --> 09:25.147
Uh, none for me.

09:27.900 --> 09:29.527
Thanks. [clears throat]

09:37.952 --> 09:43.958
Interview with Special Agent Rahul Nadeem
and Special Agent in Charge Tammy Hattley,

09:44.041 --> 09:46.794
conducted
by Supervisory Special Agent Winn,

09:46.877 --> 09:50.339
FBI Office of Professional Responsibility.

09:50.423 --> 09:53.593
Okay, Ray. You've got our attention.

09:54.385 --> 09:55.511
[Winn] What's this about?

09:59.515 --> 10:01.601
There's no good way for me to say this.

10:04.729 --> 10:08.983
But I believe Wilson Fisk is currently
engaged in a criminal conspiracy

10:09.609 --> 10:13.070
and has manipulated the bureau
into becoming his unwitting accomplice.

10:15.906 --> 10:19.952
I also have reason to believe that Fisk
has corrupted an agent on his detail.

10:20.036 --> 10:21.037
Who?

10:22.663 --> 10:23.706
Dex.

10:24.415 --> 10:26.917
[Winn] You're referring
to Special Agent Ben Poindexter?

10:27.585 --> 10:30.254
[Ray] Yes, sir. And as crazy as it sounds,

10:31.380 --> 10:34.967
I think Poindexter may have perpetrated
the attack at the<i> Bulletin.</i>

10:35.051 --> 10:37.637
What the hell are you talking about?
Why would you think that?

10:38.763 --> 10:41.849
Because while I was pursuing
those suspicions yesterday...

10:45.019 --> 10:46.646
Dex shot me.

10:46.729 --> 10:47.772
Jesus Christ.

10:50.441 --> 10:55.071
Sir, OPR needs to start
an internal investigation into Fisk,

10:55.154 --> 10:57.031
into Poindexter, into all of it.

10:57.573 --> 10:58.574
And for the record...

11:00.242 --> 11:01.619
this was on my watch.

11:02.453 --> 11:04.580
I personally ran Fisk's detail.

11:07.083 --> 11:10.586
SAC Hattley did everything by the book,
and this shouldn't fall on her.

11:13.381 --> 11:15.132
I take full responsibility.

11:18.260 --> 11:21.055
Ray, I'm sorry, but I'm placing you
on administrative leave,

11:21.138 --> 11:22.264
effective immediately. I understand.

11:28.896 --> 11:30.481
And will cooperate fully.

11:53.337 --> 11:54.338
So...

11:55.172 --> 11:56.507
what do we do next?

11:57.383 --> 11:59.301
First, we call you an ambulance.

12:00.136 --> 12:01.178
[gunshot]

12:03.222 --> 12:04.223
[Ray] No!

12:07.226 --> 12:09.812
Ray! Put down the gun! Please!

12:15.234 --> 12:19.447
Damn you, Ray.
You bring this into my house?

12:20.197 --> 12:21.198
My home? Sit down.

12:26.912 --> 12:27.913
Sit.

12:39.467 --> 12:43.345
Your prints, your weapon, the recording.

12:43.429 --> 12:45.723
Do I need to explain to you
what this means?

12:46.557 --> 12:50.978
Answer my question, please.
Do you understand your situation now?

12:53.397 --> 12:54.398
[Hattley] Ray?

12:56.066 --> 12:57.318
You get this?

13:03.407 --> 13:04.700
Yeah, boss.

13:06.619 --> 13:07.828
I understand.

13:08.662 --> 13:10.748
[Hattley] I'm not your boss anymore.

13:13.709 --> 13:15.252
Wilson Fisk is.

13:25.012 --> 13:27.014
[theme music playing]

14:35.666 --> 14:38.210
You don't have to run.
Hiding is an option.

14:38.294 --> 14:40.963
I'm not so sure it is, Foggy.
Not after what I said to Fisk.

14:41.046 --> 14:43.716
-Where will you go?
-I don't know.

14:43.799 --> 14:46.510
But I wouldn't bother paying the rent
like we did for Matt.

14:46.594 --> 14:48.637
Come on. You'll be back.

14:48.721 --> 14:51.557
Foggy,
Fisk is never gonna stop hunting me.

14:51.640 --> 14:54.518
Then don't run or hide. Do what I did.

14:54.602 --> 14:56.937
Make yourself so public
he can't touch you.

14:57.021 --> 14:59.023
Yeah, well, it's not gonna matter, Foggy.

15:00.274 --> 15:03.068
My DA campaign's kept me out
of his crosshairs so far.

15:03.152 --> 15:05.654
Yeah, well, you didn't confess
to killing his BFF, so...

15:06.322 --> 15:07.448
Valid point.

15:08.324 --> 15:11.535
-But maybe--
-Look, Foggy. I'm running.

15:11.619 --> 15:13.913
[panting]

15:14.955 --> 15:17.207
Right after I tell Matt
I completely betrayed him.

15:19.126 --> 15:20.210
Come on.

15:22.087 --> 15:23.714
You didn't betray him.

15:24.673 --> 15:26.926
Fisk knows that Matt is Daredevil
because of me.

15:27.593 --> 15:31.472
He can't actually know that for sure.
You didn't say anything.

15:32.139 --> 15:34.058
No, you weren't there. He, uh...

15:35.809 --> 15:37.227
The way he looked at me...

15:38.896 --> 15:39.897
He knows.

15:43.651 --> 15:45.653
Just, uh, destroy these for me?

15:53.202 --> 15:56.538
-No, Foggy...
-Please take it.

15:59.124 --> 16:00.125
Thank you.

16:01.377 --> 16:02.586
I should go.

16:07.257 --> 16:10.970
We're gonna get through this.
I don't know how, but we will.

16:18.060 --> 16:19.812
Watch your back. Please.

16:30.656 --> 16:31.490
[door closes]

16:31.573 --> 16:33.575
[boy sniffling]

16:36.245 --> 16:38.288
Change can be scary, Marcus.

16:40.207 --> 16:41.792
Even when it's for the good.

16:41.875 --> 16:43.210
No, it's not.

16:44.503 --> 16:46.505
[Maggie softly] Oh...

16:46.588 --> 16:50.509
You know,
the Dockerys are a wonderful family,

16:50.592 --> 16:52.344
and now you get to be a part of it.

16:54.138 --> 16:57.850
But you will always be
a part of our family, too.

17:03.731 --> 17:04.898
Maggie.

17:08.485 --> 17:09.611
What is it, Paul?

17:12.156 --> 17:13.365
[Lantom] Matthew knows.

17:31.967 --> 17:33.093
Oh...

17:38.348 --> 17:40.059
[sobbing]

18:38.200 --> 18:40.536
[Jack] I guess you know
everything now, Matty.

18:44.206 --> 18:45.624
Everything I need to.

18:48.335 --> 18:50.754
Meh. Doesn't change a goddamn thing.

18:58.345 --> 19:01.014
[breathing heavily]

19:41.180 --> 19:42.639
[knocking on door]

19:42.723 --> 19:44.016
-[Seema] Ray?
-Yeah?

19:44.099 --> 19:45.976
[Seema] You have a visitor from work.

19:51.064 --> 19:52.733
[Sami] My hand's not big enough.

19:52.816 --> 19:54.151
[Dex] Sure it is. Look.

19:54.234 --> 19:57.863
Just keep your fingers like that,
hugging the seam,

19:57.946 --> 20:00.574
and just snap your wrist
when you release it.

20:00.657 --> 20:02.201
And that makes it curve?

20:02.910 --> 20:04.036
Like crazy.

20:05.913 --> 20:08.165
There he is. Morning, Ray.

20:08.415 --> 20:10.834
Dad, he's teaching me
how to throw a curveball.

20:11.293 --> 20:12.502
[Seema] You want eggs?

20:12.586 --> 20:15.172
Uh, no, thanks.

20:15.923 --> 20:18.425
-Go get ready for school, Sami.
-But, Dad...

20:18.508 --> 20:19.843
School first, kid.

20:20.344 --> 20:21.345
Okay.

20:21.887 --> 20:24.598
This is cool. Thanks, Mr. Poindexter.

20:24.681 --> 20:28.018
Call me Dex. Your dad and me go way back.

20:32.898 --> 20:36.401
So, Dex, what brings you to my house?

20:36.985 --> 20:39.404
Well, you've been bragging
about Seema's cooking for so long,

20:39.488 --> 20:41.782
I figured I'd come up with an excuse
to finally come try it.

20:41.865 --> 20:45.911
You don't need an excuse, Dex.
What you've done for our family...

20:47.037 --> 20:47.871
[kisses]

20:48.580 --> 20:49.957
...you're always welcome here.

20:50.666 --> 20:52.542
Honey, we're gonna talk shop.

20:52.626 --> 20:56.213
Oh. Okay. But only for a few minutes.
I don't want Dex's eggs getting cold.

20:56.296 --> 20:57.214
[Ray chuckles]

21:10.852 --> 21:14.648
What are you doing here, Dex?
Your issue is with me, not my family.

21:15.399 --> 21:17.734
My issue is definitely with you.

21:18.485 --> 21:22.406
That stunt with the lawyer, Ray?
That was cold.

21:23.782 --> 21:26.493
You convinced me that you had my back.

21:27.536 --> 21:30.205
But Fisk wants you alive.

21:31.832 --> 21:33.417
What does he want from me, Dex?

21:34.209 --> 21:38.130
Your friend.
The one you brought to my home.

21:39.464 --> 21:41.967
I don't know who he is. Or where he is.

21:42.551 --> 21:43.593
Yeah, you do.

21:44.970 --> 21:46.096
But it can wait.

21:47.764 --> 21:48.974
You're bleeding, Ray.

21:51.852 --> 21:53.020
[knocking on window]

21:58.650 --> 22:01.278
I'll cover with Seema
while you change your shirt.

22:01.361 --> 22:04.573
Now, let's go.
We're spending the day together, partner.

22:06.074 --> 22:07.242
It smells delicious.

22:09.745 --> 22:11.455
Taste as good as it looks?

22:12.039 --> 22:13.165
[Foggy] Shit.

22:19.463 --> 22:20.756
I have a super for that.

22:21.423 --> 22:23.008
I can fix this, damn it.

22:23.091 --> 22:25.635
-You okay?
-Peachy.

22:26.803 --> 22:29.639
Karen and Matt can do whatever they want.
I'm not gonna run.

22:29.723 --> 22:32.142
You can't quit now.
You're giving people hope.

22:32.225 --> 22:34.102
Mrs. Wobschall stopped me
in the produce aisle.

22:34.186 --> 22:35.771
At first, I didn't believe her,

22:35.854 --> 22:37.689
but then she showed me
a clip on her iPhone.

22:37.773 --> 22:40.442
You were a natural. Totally amazing.

22:41.526 --> 22:42.819
What are you talking about?

22:42.903 --> 22:45.822
<i>Because when you get</i>
<i>beyond the cold facts,</i>

22:45.906 --> 22:49.284
<i>and you really get worked up</i>
<i>about what you're doing, you can...</i>

22:49.910 --> 22:50.911
<i>Holy shit.</i>

22:50.994 --> 22:52.579
[Marci] We've got to work
on your closing,

22:52.662 --> 22:56.917
but this video has had nearly
100,000 views in its first 24 hours.

22:57.000 --> 22:59.669
Half the cops in New York have reposted it
to their personal accounts.

22:59.753 --> 23:01.171
Has Blake Tower responded?

23:01.254 --> 23:03.173
Complete radio silence.

23:03.256 --> 23:06.218
Probably because you've successfully
branded him as the pro-Fisk candidate

23:06.301 --> 23:08.220
and anything he says
will only make it worse.

23:08.303 --> 23:12.474
-Wow.
-Foggy, if you play this right...

23:13.016 --> 23:14.267
I could actually win.

23:15.394 --> 23:22.234
And as the new DA, you make it
your top priority to nail Wilson Fisk.

23:24.945 --> 23:28.156
I don't have much time.
Fisk is doing something.

23:28.240 --> 23:29.616
[Matt] <i>Specifics, Ray.</i>

23:29.699 --> 23:32.369
I don't know what.
But when I do, I'll call you.

23:33.078 --> 23:34.079
Be ready.

23:38.375 --> 23:39.584
It's done.

23:40.252 --> 23:41.586
Nice work, partner.

23:50.053 --> 23:53.473
It's a shitty way for you to find out,
Matty, about your mother.

23:53.557 --> 23:56.059
Yeah. You should have told me.

23:57.561 --> 24:00.230
[Jack] Maybe I promised her
that I wouldn't.

24:00.313 --> 24:01.982
[Matt] That is no excuse.

24:02.065 --> 24:03.650
[Jack] Yeah, I know, kid.

24:03.733 --> 24:05.235
But after I took that bullet,

24:05.318 --> 24:07.863
Maggie had years to tell you the truth
and she didn't.

24:07.946 --> 24:09.948
That wasn't my choice, it was hers.

24:10.031 --> 24:12.534
You both lied. You both left.

24:15.620 --> 24:17.622
I never left you.

24:17.706 --> 24:20.292
You didn't go down in that fight
like you were supposed to.

24:20.375 --> 24:21.960
Knowing they'd kill you for it.

24:22.043 --> 24:23.712
I did that for you.

24:23.795 --> 24:25.881
So you'd know
what your old man is made of.

24:25.964 --> 24:29.217
My old man chose his ego over a lifetime
with his son. That's what I know.

24:30.427 --> 24:33.305
[Jack] It wasn't ego,
it was living up to a code.

24:34.556 --> 24:35.891
Being a man.

24:36.975 --> 24:40.812
It means lovin' the feel of my fist
in someone else's face.

24:41.688 --> 24:43.523
It means waiting for them
to hit the ground

24:43.607 --> 24:45.400
and knowing that I put them there.

24:45.484 --> 24:47.527
And, yeah, okay...

24:48.653 --> 24:52.657
maybe I put that at the top of my list
and maybe it cost me everything,

24:52.741 --> 24:53.867
including you.

24:56.244 --> 24:57.913
But you do the same thing.

24:59.498 --> 25:01.291
No, I don't.

25:01.374 --> 25:04.628
[Jack] You have a code, too.
You beat the shit out of people.

25:04.711 --> 25:07.297
You tell yourself it's okay
because you didn't kill anyone.

25:08.131 --> 25:12.761
There is something wrong with us, Matty.
It's just who we are.

25:12.844 --> 25:14.721
That's who you were, Dad.

25:16.097 --> 25:17.390
I'm not like you.

25:18.975 --> 25:20.352
I don't throw fights.

25:21.186 --> 25:24.481
And I don't let everyone else suffer
'cause of some bullshit code.

25:25.649 --> 25:26.775
Not anymore.

25:30.529 --> 25:32.072
When I get to Fisk...

25:33.949 --> 25:35.367
I'm gonna kill him.

25:36.368 --> 25:38.453
[echoes of baby crying]

25:44.334 --> 25:46.294
[children laughing]

25:51.716 --> 25:54.761
-[boy] Sister Maggie... Sister Maggie?
-Devin.

26:04.437 --> 26:06.773
[Karen] Excuse me, Sister Maggie?

26:08.692 --> 26:11.111
I'm sorry to bother you.
They told me I could find you here.

26:12.237 --> 26:14.948
He's gone. I don't know where.

26:16.283 --> 26:21.246
[sighs] It's a matter of life and death.
Do you have any idea when he'll be back?

26:23.415 --> 26:24.708
He won't be.

26:26.293 --> 26:27.294
[Karen] I...

26:28.003 --> 26:30.130
I don't understand. Why? Why not?

26:34.926 --> 26:36.511
He learned the truth.

26:39.055 --> 26:40.473
That I'm his mother.

26:43.310 --> 26:45.228
Wow. Uh...

26:47.105 --> 26:50.650
He never talked about... about you.

26:52.736 --> 26:55.864
I was a danger to Matthew
when I gave him up.

26:58.450 --> 27:01.369
Nowadays, they know a great deal
about postpartum, but...

27:02.203 --> 27:03.371
at the time...

27:06.249 --> 27:09.836
I was convinced that I was betraying God.

27:12.589 --> 27:17.594
[clicks tongue] I hadn't yet
taken my vows, but in my heart...

27:19.012 --> 27:22.057
I believed I had committed
an unforgivable sin.

27:22.766 --> 27:25.310
And so I replaced that sin with another.

27:27.479 --> 27:29.397
I abandoned my child.

27:32.734 --> 27:35.236
Why... Why did you tell him now?

27:35.779 --> 27:39.074
I didn't. He found out on his own.

27:40.241 --> 27:41.743
I wanted to tell him.

27:42.577 --> 27:49.084
When Jack was alive, I convinced myself
the truth would confuse Matthew.

27:50.001 --> 27:53.838
After Jack died, I convinced myself
it would do more harm than good.

27:54.506 --> 28:00.595
Finally, I just realized
that I was too much of a coward.

28:03.056 --> 28:04.474
The Lord has a way.

28:06.351 --> 28:09.521
Sending the Devil of Hell's Kitchen
to me now.

28:11.731 --> 28:14.109
Showing me what became of my sin.

28:15.902 --> 28:18.905
The Lord gave me another chance
to make things right.

28:20.115 --> 28:22.992
And I failed, yet again.

28:26.162 --> 28:28.498
Matthew knows who and what I am now.

28:30.041 --> 28:31.418
He won't be back.

28:39.092 --> 28:42.429
I'm sorry.
It's unfair of me to burden you.

28:44.305 --> 28:47.183
[stammering] I just... I don't...

28:48.143 --> 28:49.936
I don't know what to say.

28:52.272 --> 28:55.483
What can you say to someone
who's scarred your friend for life?

29:00.280 --> 29:02.949
He must be in a lot of pain right now.

29:05.952 --> 29:08.371
When you find him, he'll need a friend.

29:10.331 --> 29:13.960
That's just it.
See, I can't really stick around.

29:14.043 --> 29:15.128
Um...

29:17.589 --> 29:23.928
Fisk knows... about Matt. I just...
I just wanted to warn him before I run.

29:24.512 --> 29:26.765
-Are you in danger?
-Yeah.

29:27.307 --> 29:29.517
Matt's not the only one
that Fisk wants dead.

29:30.059 --> 29:31.394
Do you have someplace to go?

29:31.478 --> 29:33.772
No, I was just gonna get
the first bus out of town.

29:35.648 --> 29:37.442
I can help you.

29:38.234 --> 29:39.194
[laughs]

29:39.611 --> 29:43.281
Uh, yeah, no, you don't want me anywhere
near you right now. Trust me.

29:43.364 --> 29:46.868
The church has been helping people hide
for 2,000 years.

29:46.951 --> 29:48.411
Hide here.

29:49.788 --> 29:51.414
Give me a day to make a few calls,

29:51.498 --> 29:55.460
and you'll have shelter halfway
around the world by the end of the week.

29:58.087 --> 30:01.466
Please, let me do something for you.

30:03.802 --> 30:04.886
For Matthew.

30:06.012 --> 30:07.013
[softly] Yeah.

30:23.321 --> 30:26.449
[Hattley] Everybody,
I have an announcement.

30:27.408 --> 30:29.369
And some good news after a shitty week.

30:30.453 --> 30:32.038
I'm happy to tell you that

30:32.121 --> 30:35.166
Special Agent Poindexter
has been reinstated to duty.

30:35.250 --> 30:36.876
[all clapping]

30:37.377 --> 30:41.214
[Hattley] Turns out even DC can't hold
good deeds against someone forever.

30:41.297 --> 30:42.382
[agents chuckling]

30:42.465 --> 30:43.633
[Hattley] Seriously, people...

30:44.300 --> 30:47.178
the way you came together
and helped Dex hire that lawyer...

30:47.846 --> 30:48.847
I'm proud of you.

30:49.848 --> 30:51.975
If we don't look out for each other,
who will?

30:53.601 --> 30:55.061
You got anything to say, Dex?

30:56.354 --> 30:57.355
[Dex] Uh...

30:57.981 --> 31:00.316
I guess I just wanna say thank you.

31:00.400 --> 31:02.652
I wouldn't be here without your help.

31:03.945 --> 31:05.321
Especially you, Ray.

31:06.322 --> 31:09.075
Someday, I'll pay you back
for everything you did.

31:09.158 --> 31:11.661
[all clapping]

31:14.998 --> 31:17.041
You look good, Franklin.

31:17.125 --> 31:19.377
<i>I'm still passionate</i>
<i>about what the law can do.</i>

31:19.460 --> 31:22.797
-Maybe a haircut next time, though.
-[all laughing]

31:22.881 --> 31:24.966
He's making quite the name for himself.

31:25.884 --> 31:28.928
Theo, you gotta see this movie
your brother's in.

31:29.470 --> 31:31.222
Let me fix you a plate, sweetie.
Come here.

31:31.306 --> 31:34.017
Hold on, Ma.
I need a couple minutes with Foggy.

31:35.435 --> 31:36.436
I'll be quick.

31:36.519 --> 31:38.563
Don't worry about her, Foggy.
She'll be fine.

31:38.646 --> 31:41.941
So, Marci, have you considered
freezing your eggs?

31:42.025 --> 31:43.943
-It's never too late.
-[Edward] Anna!

31:45.528 --> 31:46.863
This better be important.

31:48.156 --> 31:52.076
All that stuff you said about Fisk
on the video, you gotta take it back.

31:52.160 --> 31:55.121
-What are you talking about?
-You have to make a different video, man.

31:55.204 --> 31:57.790
Issue a statement or whatever.
Say you were drunk.

31:57.874 --> 31:59.375
<i>Au contraire, mon frère.</i>

31:59.459 --> 32:01.294
That's the last thing I gotta do.

32:01.377 --> 32:05.423
I gotta exploit this opportunity
to expose everything Fisk is doing.

32:05.506 --> 32:09.344
No, no, no. Foggy, listen to me.
You need to apologize.

32:10.511 --> 32:14.015
What happened?
Did someone come after you, Theo?

32:14.891 --> 32:16.309
Fog, it's real bad.

32:18.436 --> 32:21.856
About a year ago, some of our suppliers
stopped taking our orders.

32:21.940 --> 32:24.567
Just stopped.
No reason I could understand.

32:25.193 --> 32:27.195
We couldn't change their minds
for the love of money.

32:27.904 --> 32:31.032
After a few months, the shop
was in a tight spot financially, right?

32:31.115 --> 32:33.326
And we didn't have the collateral
to get a loan--

32:33.409 --> 32:35.787
Why didn't you come to me?
I could have helped.

32:35.870 --> 32:38.122
I didn't have to,
because of what happened next.

32:38.206 --> 32:41.042
Out of the blue, I get this call
from a bank I never heard of

32:41.125 --> 32:43.962
offering to help us out. Red Lion Bank.

32:44.837 --> 32:47.215
-Shit.
-You know these guys?

32:47.757 --> 32:49.717
Just keep going.

32:50.677 --> 32:52.553
[sighs] So, the loan officer there,

32:52.637 --> 32:55.556
he coaches me
on how to move the numbers around.

32:55.640 --> 32:58.226
Make our assets look healthier, you know.

32:58.309 --> 33:00.937
And bam!
The loan comes through without a hitch.

33:01.020 --> 33:03.564
I don't give it another thought.
Life goes on.

33:04.148 --> 33:06.651
I mean,
we've been through a lot around here.

33:07.402 --> 33:09.278
And the old suppliers came back.

33:09.362 --> 33:12.156
Yeah. Yeah, they did,
now you mention it.

33:12.699 --> 33:14.325
And then someone came to talk to you?

33:14.409 --> 33:18.997
This afternoon, yeah.
This old English dude comes to see me.

33:19.580 --> 33:21.958
He knew all about the creative accounting
on the loan app.

33:22.834 --> 33:25.545
He said unless I could convince you

33:25.628 --> 33:28.089
to walk back everything
you said about Fisk...

33:29.132 --> 33:30.800
he'd have Red Lion call the loan.

33:31.843 --> 33:33.177
Of course.

33:33.261 --> 33:36.139
Foggy, that application...

33:37.015 --> 33:39.559
if anyone looks too carefully at it...

33:39.642 --> 33:41.185
You're going to jail.

33:42.437 --> 33:43.563
Not just me.

33:45.189 --> 33:47.066
Mom and Dad signed it, too.

33:53.239 --> 33:55.992
[indistinct chatter]

33:58.619 --> 34:00.538
We have a new teammate today.

34:02.123 --> 34:03.499
Take a seat, Ray.

34:06.544 --> 34:10.882
I don't believe it.
Fisk's got something on all of you?

34:22.977 --> 34:23.978
Arinori?

34:25.313 --> 34:28.816
Better we don't talk about it.
And in here, we don't even say his name.

34:29.567 --> 34:34.155
That's one of the rules, Ray.
We only refer to him by his code name.

34:35.865 --> 34:36.991
What code name?

34:38.868 --> 34:39.869
Kingpin.

34:41.579 --> 34:45.583
Another roundup, gentlemen.
And we're going to hit them fast and hard.

34:46.584 --> 34:48.544
Kingpin wants this one to make a point.

34:55.635 --> 34:57.220
[agent 1] FBI! Don't move!

34:57.720 --> 34:59.138
[man] Shit. It's the feds!

35:01.682 --> 35:03.142
[agent 2] Down on the ground, now!

35:04.477 --> 35:06.562
-Stay where you are.
-[man] No.

35:06.646 --> 35:08.940
[Dex] John Hammer, you're coming with us.

35:09.023 --> 35:10.650
[groaning]

35:24.580 --> 35:27.458
[siren blaring]

35:31.838 --> 35:33.297
[Dex] Good morning, Mr. Starr.

35:34.006 --> 35:36.467
[handcuffs closing]

35:41.556 --> 35:43.599
[crowd clapping]

35:45.101 --> 35:46.227
[Ray] I got this one.

35:53.401 --> 35:54.861
Please come quietly.

36:09.250 --> 36:12.086
-[Dex] Shift change, guys.
-We just came on an hour ago.

36:12.712 --> 36:13.796
Hattley's orders.

36:14.380 --> 36:17.341
I think she's punishing me
for getting off suspension so fast.

36:17.425 --> 36:19.468
And thanks for bringing me
along for the ride.

36:20.261 --> 36:21.637
[Alvarez] She's the boss.

36:24.223 --> 36:26.309
-[Ramsey] See you later.
-[elevator dings]

36:36.360 --> 36:39.280
So what was it? Money?

36:40.698 --> 36:42.491
I've known you for ten years,
for Chrissakes.

36:42.575 --> 36:43.993
[Hattley] Shut your goddamn mouth.

36:44.744 --> 36:46.829
Or what?
You'll frame me for another murder?

36:48.497 --> 36:49.874
Keep your head forward.

36:51.375 --> 36:53.794
There's no mics in here,
but you know they're watching.

36:55.463 --> 36:58.216
[Ray] You murdered Winn.
How do you live with that?

37:00.176 --> 37:01.969
[Hattley] I killed him to save your life.

37:03.804 --> 37:06.557
That's right. This is on you.

37:07.683 --> 37:09.685
I didn't tell you
to break into Dex's apartment.

37:09.769 --> 37:11.896
I would've stopped you,
and you wouldn't be here.

37:13.272 --> 37:14.732
But here you are.

37:17.735 --> 37:19.320
[Ray] I can't believe you want this.

37:20.238 --> 37:22.782
We made this happen.
We can find a way to end it.

37:23.574 --> 37:25.993
[Hattley] There's no way out, Ray.

37:26.869 --> 37:28.871
Fisk's had you marked
for more than a year.

37:32.959 --> 37:34.794
What do you mean, had me marked?

37:35.795 --> 37:38.214
Why do you think your sister-in-law
lost health coverage?

37:39.924 --> 37:41.342
He made you desperate for this job,

37:41.425 --> 37:43.552
you did everything you could
to get him this penthouse,

37:43.636 --> 37:45.012
get him everything he asked for.

37:47.056 --> 37:50.559
Like I said, there's no way out.

37:53.145 --> 37:54.647
We're out of our league here.

37:57.358 --> 37:59.318
[elevator stops and door opens]

38:03.823 --> 38:06.367
You could've gone to Homeland Security
or the NYPD.

38:06.450 --> 38:08.828
Not take me down with you.
Not murder an agent.

38:08.911 --> 38:11.872
You make a report.
You get your family somewhere safe. Jesus.

38:11.956 --> 38:13.541
That's not an option with Fisk.

38:17.169 --> 38:18.796
I used to have two children, Ray. They made it look like a hit-and-run.

38:22.842 --> 38:25.303
I got a divorce.
Maybe that keeps him a little safer.

38:26.470 --> 38:28.806
But there's still Allie, so...

38:30.057 --> 38:31.642
Think about Seema and Sami.

38:33.394 --> 38:35.062
And do what Fisk tells you.

38:40.234 --> 38:41.068
[keypad beeping]

38:45.948 --> 38:48.284
-Where is Mrs. Shelby?
-She's on her way, sir.

38:49.535 --> 38:50.619
No.

38:51.829 --> 38:53.122
Nadeem.

39:23.569 --> 39:24.570
[Fisk] Let's go.

40:20.334 --> 40:22.086
[grunting]

40:22.169 --> 40:24.296
[cell phone ringing]

40:28.551 --> 40:31.178
-Yeah?
-[Ray] <i>Fisk has left the hotel.</i>

40:32.179 --> 40:33.556
How is that possible?

40:34.974 --> 40:37.685
I don't think Dex
was the only FBI agent he turned.

40:38.394 --> 40:40.896
But he's taking Fisk
to meet with other crime bosses.

40:41.564 --> 40:44.400
-Some kind of sit-down.
-[Matt] <i>Where?</i>

40:46.026 --> 40:49.363
I'm texting you the address.
But if you catch Fisk in the act--

40:49.447 --> 40:53.325
This is our chance to take him down.
Thank you, Nadeem.

40:59.748 --> 41:01.667
[Fisk] We'll meet you inside, Nadeem.

41:09.592 --> 41:10.968
What do you want me to do?

41:11.594 --> 41:12.678
Be ready.

41:13.888 --> 41:17.808
Daredevil will know it's a trap,
but he'll come anyway.

41:22.188 --> 41:23.856
[automated voice]
<i>Red Fish Blue Restaurant,</i>

41:23.939 --> 41:25.733
<i>48th Street and 9th Avenue.</i>

41:29.778 --> 41:31.655
[Jack] You're not fallin' for that,
are you?

41:32.698 --> 41:36.035
That guy, he ain't in your corner.
Not anymore.

41:36.619 --> 41:37.995
That doesn't matter.

41:39.705 --> 41:42.791
It's been a long time
since you used Muay Thai ropes, Matty.

41:42.875 --> 41:47.296
That guy in my suit kicked my ass.
I can't beat him from a distance.

41:47.379 --> 41:50.716
I gotta draw him in close
and do more damage.

41:50.799 --> 41:54.094
You're too mad to think straight.
And it's gonna get you killed.

41:55.387 --> 41:57.723
Matty, come on.

42:00.976 --> 42:04.897
Your mother didn't only leave you.
She left me, too.

42:06.857 --> 42:08.984
You looking for sympathy?
'Cause that's not happening.

42:09.068 --> 42:10.903
She left us because we're cursed.

42:11.695 --> 42:12.696
[chuckles]

42:12.780 --> 42:15.241
Because she knew we got the devil inside.

42:15.324 --> 42:16.450
So it's my fault?

42:18.452 --> 42:20.329
Would you be honest with yourself?

42:23.832 --> 42:28.212
You put on that mask because it lets you
feel all right with who you really are.

42:28.295 --> 42:32.841
It lets you hurt people and makes you
feel like it's for something important...

42:32.925 --> 42:35.344
[Fisk] ...something good,
maybe even for God.

42:35.427 --> 42:38.430
But that ain't the truth,
and we both know it.

42:38.973 --> 42:41.392
You and your father
are cut from the same cloth.

42:41.976 --> 42:46.689
A corrupt boxer who takes
as much satisfaction in inflicting pain

42:46.772 --> 42:49.066
as he does money for taking dives.

42:49.608 --> 42:50.609
And his son,

42:50.693 --> 42:53.904
who's trying to convince himself
he's any better than his criminal father.

42:55.364 --> 42:57.491
You were born from nothing.

42:58.200 --> 42:59.910
You remain nothing.

42:59.994 --> 43:02.079
[shouting and grunting]

43:46.498 --> 43:48.792
-Arrest me, or I'm leaving.
-Stay where you are.

43:48.876 --> 43:50.419
We have a right to counsel.

43:52.004 --> 43:55.132
This some bullshit.
What are we waiting for?

43:55.215 --> 43:56.675
We'll know when it happens.

43:58.385 --> 43:59.970
You know something about what's going on?

44:00.054 --> 44:04.224
Well, they pick us up all quiet like.
No press, no perp walk.

44:04.308 --> 44:07.186
Take us here instead of downtown.
The feds want something.

44:15.903 --> 44:16.987
[door opens]

44:17.738 --> 44:19.865
[footsteps approaching]

44:28.791 --> 44:32.002
-[Zyl] Fisk?
-[Starr] What the hell is this?

44:33.671 --> 44:35.589
It's an opportunity, Mr. Starr.

45:12.376 --> 45:14.253
[sniffs and exhales]

45:21.593 --> 45:26.849
I've brought you here
to offer you my protection.

45:27.933 --> 45:33.397
From investigations and prosecutions
by the federal government.

45:34.773 --> 45:37.860
Bullshit. This is a sting.

45:37.943 --> 45:42.072
[Carter] Hey, jury, if you can hear this
on tape, I'm totally innocent.

45:42.156 --> 45:44.032
I don't even know these people.

45:47.119 --> 45:49.997
How much? What's the vig?

45:50.873 --> 45:52.666
-Twenty percent.
-[Hammer] For Chrissake.

45:52.750 --> 45:53.751
Of everything.

45:55.002 --> 45:59.590
I don't know how you keep that suit white
with all the bullshit you pack into it.

46:00.507 --> 46:04.303
I know what this is.
We all know what this is.

46:05.012 --> 46:07.973
You want us to confess to something
that buys you another month

46:08.056 --> 46:10.976
in that hotel suite
you conned yourself into.

46:11.059 --> 46:15.355
No. You can count me out.

46:24.740 --> 46:25.991
[inhales sharply]

46:26.408 --> 46:27.701
[exhales]

46:33.832 --> 46:36.710
The tax is now 25 percent.

46:40.631 --> 46:43.884
I gotta hand it to you, Fisk.
You know how to put on a show.

46:46.261 --> 46:50.057
Just one question.
Where do I drop the cash?

48:12.806 --> 48:14.349
If you tipped him...

48:14.433 --> 48:17.060
I said exactly what you told me to say.

48:18.604 --> 48:19.688
You were there.

48:25.027 --> 48:26.028
Let's go.

48:43.170 --> 48:45.422
[Doyle] Moving to Stairwell C.
Weapons out.

49:22.000 --> 49:24.878
[inhales, exhales deeply]

50:02.374 --> 50:04.251
[electricity buzzing]

50:11.633 --> 50:12.884
[tapping lightly]

50:15.387 --> 50:16.596
[tapping]

50:56.428 --> 50:58.847
[Shelby breathing shakily]

51:01.516 --> 51:02.893
Are you gonna kill me?

51:06.271 --> 51:07.272
[Matt] No.

51:09.775 --> 51:10.859
Not you. Fisk?

51:21.203 --> 51:23.038
[shudders] Oh, thank God.

51:23.997 --> 51:25.207
[Matt] When will he be back?

51:26.458 --> 51:27.459
[Shelby] Minutes.

51:36.176 --> 51:37.219
Thank you.

51:38.428 --> 51:41.014
[Ramsey over radio] <i>Karen Page</i>
<i>located at the Clinton Church.</i>

51:41.098 --> 51:46.228
<i>Keep all NYPD units clear of that location</i>
<i>until otherwise advised. Copy?</i>

51:46.812 --> 51:48.688
What does Fisk want with Karen?

51:49.314 --> 51:50.690
[Shelby] He wants her killed.
