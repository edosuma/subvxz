00:01.001 --> 00:05.973
** (upbeat music)

00:06.006 --> 00:09.877
(singing in foreign language)

00:09.910 --> 00:12.180
(man)
It's poison!

00:35.069 --> 00:37.004
Jesus!

00:37.037 --> 00:40.308
Dick!

00:42.876 --> 00:44.445
Why did you
wanna come here?

00:44.478 --> 00:46.580
The chicks.

00:46.614 --> 00:49.217
(music continues)

01:02.496 --> 01:05.966
These girls are
about 15 years old.

01:05.999 --> 01:09.337
How old are we?

01:13.474 --> 01:15.976
People are smoking pot
in public now.

01:16.009 --> 01:18.846
I kind of liked it
when it was illegal.

01:23.417 --> 01:25.719
Some of these kids
are Lilly's age.

01:25.753 --> 01:27.054
How old's Lilly?

01:27.087 --> 01:28.322
Look at this kid--
12 years old.

01:28.356 --> 01:30.858
My daughter's
12 years old.

01:40.168 --> 01:41.602
Hey, man.

01:51.145 --> 01:52.180
Daddy!

01:52.213 --> 01:54.648
Get over here!

01:54.682 --> 01:55.983
Old jagoff.

01:56.016 --> 01:57.951
(kids laughing)

01:57.985 --> 01:59.687
(Lilly)
I wasn't doing anything!

01:59.720 --> 02:01.789
Daddy, stop it,
you're embarrassing me!

02:01.822 --> 02:03.591
Daddy, stop!

02:03.624 --> 02:05.259
Dad, stop it!

02:05.293 --> 02:06.460
Dad, stop,
let go of me!

02:06.494 --> 02:07.495
You're embarrassing me.

02:07.528 --> 02:09.830
I wasn't
doing anything!

02:09.863 --> 02:11.299
Stop it!

02:11.332 --> 02:13.534
Dad-- Oh, my God,
Dad, stop.

02:13.567 --> 02:16.036
Daddy!

02:16.069 --> 02:20.974
Daddy, stop it,
I wasn't doing anything.

02:21.008 --> 02:22.810
Daddy.

02:24.077 --> 02:27.281
Daddy!

02:27.315 --> 02:29.717
Daddy, listen
to me, okay?

02:29.750 --> 02:31.319
Dad, stop it.

02:31.352 --> 02:32.886
Sit down, sit!

02:32.920 --> 02:35.022
Sit!

02:37.258 --> 02:39.227
(gasping)

02:39.260 --> 02:41.695
Oh, God.

02:41.729 --> 02:43.364
Oh, my God.

02:43.397 --> 02:47.067
I didn't do anything--
I saw you!

02:47.100 --> 02:50.204
I saw you!

02:50.238 --> 02:53.974
You're 12 years old!

02:54.007 --> 02:56.577
Oh, my God.

03:09.723 --> 03:12.360
(cashier)
The onions and no tomatoes?

03:14.061 --> 03:16.063
Lilly.
What?

03:16.096 --> 03:18.065
Don't--
You don't do that.

03:18.098 --> 03:20.067
You don't do that
right now.

03:22.303 --> 03:24.472
You're in
a lot of trouble.

03:27.975 --> 03:30.244
Your mom, ugh...

03:30.278 --> 03:31.879
She's gonna
kill you.

03:31.912 --> 03:34.114
I don't care.

03:34.147 --> 03:36.984
What happened to you?
Nothing!

03:40.554 --> 03:41.789
You know,
you think you can--

03:41.822 --> 03:43.957
You think you can
handle this.

03:43.991 --> 03:46.594
You think this is fun?

03:46.627 --> 03:50.398
You can't handle
this, Lilly.

03:50.431 --> 03:53.000
What do you
know about it?

03:58.939 --> 04:02.943
**

04:10.351 --> 04:12.085
You excited to go
to school today?

04:12.119 --> 04:14.054
(scoffing)

04:14.087 --> 04:17.325
You excited
to go to work?

04:17.358 --> 04:20.494
You know what,
I am excited.

04:20.528 --> 04:23.063
You should always be excited
when you're given another day.

04:23.096 --> 04:27.501
You know, another day
is another chance at...

04:27.535 --> 04:31.104
something, I don't know.

04:31.138 --> 04:35.008
You never know
what can happen.

04:35.042 --> 04:37.945
Okay.

04:37.978 --> 04:40.013
But I hate this school.

04:40.047 --> 04:42.082
Ah...

04:42.115 --> 04:44.685
It's your last year.

04:44.718 --> 04:48.255
Next year,
you'll be in...

04:48.288 --> 04:50.524
high school.

04:58.165 --> 04:59.700
Have a good one.

04:59.733 --> 05:02.002
Bye, Mom.
Thanks for the ride.

05:02.035 --> 05:04.905
Thanks for
thanking me.

05:08.041 --> 05:10.844
Bye.

05:17.485 --> 05:22.690
Thus concludes our unit
on minerals.

05:22.723 --> 05:25.393
Which you all
pretty much tanked.

05:25.426 --> 05:28.729
(class laughing)

05:28.762 --> 05:30.898
But...

05:30.931 --> 05:33.901
onward.

05:33.934 --> 05:37.805
Okay, who can tell me

05:37.838 --> 05:40.073
what this is?

05:40.107 --> 05:41.575
Anyone.

05:41.609 --> 05:45.178
Does anyone know
what this is?

05:45.212 --> 05:47.415
Nobody knows
what this is?

05:47.448 --> 05:48.916
That's too bad.

05:48.949 --> 05:51.351
I don't know either,
I was hoping you could help.

05:51.385 --> 05:52.920
(class laughing)

05:52.953 --> 05:57.525
Okay, we got six months
left together.

05:57.558 --> 06:00.394
Now, I could move
from mineral to rocks,

06:00.428 --> 06:02.563
which, I mean,
who cares?

06:02.596 --> 06:05.733
I want to teach you based on
what makes you curious.

06:05.766 --> 06:06.834
Okay?

06:06.867 --> 06:11.104
So we're gonna do
a new unit of work

06:11.138 --> 06:13.373
every week
based on you,

06:13.407 --> 06:14.875
and what interests you.

06:14.908 --> 06:18.712
So what in the realm
of science interests you?

06:18.746 --> 06:20.280
Who's got a question
about science?

06:20.313 --> 06:21.749
Anyone--
Albert?

06:21.782 --> 06:24.618
Is it true that you
can light a fart on fire?

06:24.652 --> 06:27.054
(class giggling)

06:27.087 --> 06:28.622
Excellent question.

06:28.656 --> 06:29.757
Excellent question!

06:29.790 --> 06:32.626
Can you light
a fart on fire?

06:36.964 --> 06:39.933
Can you...

06:39.967 --> 06:42.470
light...

06:42.503 --> 06:46.139
a fart...

06:46.173 --> 06:49.810
on fire!

06:49.843 --> 06:51.545
Fire!

06:51.579 --> 06:53.614
Can you light
a fart on fire?

06:53.647 --> 06:58.652
So, how do we answer
this question?

06:58.686 --> 07:02.490
Let's look in the great
book of scientific knowledge.

07:02.523 --> 07:04.424
Fart...

07:04.458 --> 07:05.793
Fart...

07:05.826 --> 07:08.796
You ever seen fart
in the book?

07:08.829 --> 07:11.499
Fart...
Gotta be in here.

07:11.532 --> 07:15.669
Formaldehyde,
fallout,

07:15.703 --> 07:17.437
farming technology...

07:17.471 --> 07:18.506
(class giggling)

07:18.539 --> 07:22.643
Nope, no farts
in the book.

07:22.676 --> 07:25.779
So let's do
an experiment.

07:25.813 --> 07:28.816
Albert, would you like
to be our farter?

07:28.849 --> 07:31.485
Uh, I don't have
a fart right now.

07:31.519 --> 07:32.520
No?

07:32.553 --> 07:34.121
Okay, who has a fart?

07:34.154 --> 07:36.624
Who has a fart
in them?

07:36.657 --> 07:37.791
Who feels like
they could fart right now

07:37.825 --> 07:39.192
in the interest
of science?

07:39.226 --> 07:40.594
Anyone?

07:40.628 --> 07:42.530
I'm really just
asking the boys here.

07:42.563 --> 07:45.533
I don't expect-- I don't
wanna see a girl fart.

07:45.566 --> 07:46.634
(class giggling)

07:46.667 --> 07:48.135
Louie, come on up.

07:48.168 --> 07:49.603
Okay.

07:49.637 --> 07:52.706
Louie is gonna
provide the fuel.

07:52.740 --> 07:56.143
I will provide...

07:56.176 --> 07:58.378
(gas flowing)

07:58.411 --> 08:02.349
...initial combustion.

08:02.382 --> 08:05.986
Don't worry, Louie,
you're safe.

08:06.019 --> 08:08.922
Okay, Louie,
bend over the desk.

08:11.424 --> 08:13.160
This may be my last day here.

08:13.193 --> 08:15.028
(class laughing)

08:15.062 --> 08:17.197
Okay, Louie.

08:17.230 --> 08:19.399
Ready?
Mm-hmm.

08:19.432 --> 08:22.335
One, two,

08:22.369 --> 08:25.172
three, fart!

08:25.205 --> 08:26.907
(Louie grunts)

08:26.940 --> 08:28.709
I thought you said
you had one.

08:28.742 --> 08:29.977
I do, I just...

08:30.010 --> 08:32.479
You got
performance anxiety?

08:32.512 --> 08:33.814
I think, I--
Okay, okay, look,

08:33.847 --> 08:35.716
okay, just relax.

08:35.749 --> 08:38.151
Just take
a deep breath.

08:38.185 --> 08:39.720
Take it easy.

08:39.753 --> 08:41.421
All right,
come on, Louie.

08:41.454 --> 08:43.523
Do it for science.

08:43.557 --> 08:46.594
Galileo, Einstein,

08:46.627 --> 08:47.728
Louie.

08:47.761 --> 08:49.597
(class laughing)

08:49.630 --> 08:50.664
Whoa!
Ah.

08:50.698 --> 08:52.600
Whoa!
(class applauding)

08:52.633 --> 08:53.867
Nice fart.

08:53.901 --> 08:58.438
And so, methane gas--
methane gas,

08:58.471 --> 09:00.440
which is combustible,

09:00.473 --> 09:01.775
has been generated
organically

09:01.809 --> 09:04.177
inside of young Louie.

09:04.211 --> 09:08.616
So, this week we will explore
organic fuel sources.

09:08.649 --> 09:10.450
Tomorrow we're gonna
blow up a sweet potato!

09:10.483 --> 09:11.785
(class exclaiming)

09:11.819 --> 09:13.921
That's what
I'm talking about.

09:20.661 --> 09:22.562
Good job, Louie.
Thanks.

09:22.596 --> 09:23.597
Nice job, Louie.

09:23.631 --> 09:24.865
Thanks.

09:24.898 --> 09:26.634
Louie, nice job.
Thank you.

09:26.667 --> 09:28.636
Thanks for helping out.
It's okay.

09:28.669 --> 09:30.971
Say, could you, uh,
come in early tomorrow,

09:31.004 --> 09:32.973
help me set up
the potato thing?

09:33.006 --> 09:34.875
Sure, yeah.

09:34.908 --> 09:36.877
Great.

09:36.910 --> 09:38.612
Dad?

09:38.646 --> 09:39.647
Uh, yeah?

09:39.680 --> 09:40.648
Can you give me
a ride home?

09:40.681 --> 09:42.850
You got it, sweet pea.

09:45.585 --> 09:46.787
You lookin'
at my daughter?

09:46.820 --> 09:48.722
No, no!
Don't look at my daughter.

09:48.756 --> 09:51.391
Don't you ever
in your life--

09:51.424 --> 09:53.593
Hey, take it easy,
I'm kidding.

09:53.627 --> 09:54.662
I'm kidding!

09:54.695 --> 09:55.796
Please look at
my daughter.

09:55.829 --> 09:57.631
Hey, ask her out.

09:57.665 --> 09:58.732
Why don't you
take her to the dance?

09:58.766 --> 09:59.833
Are you gonna go
to the dance?

09:59.867 --> 10:00.934
I-- I don't know.

10:00.968 --> 10:02.569
Come on,
Louie, please,

10:02.602 --> 10:03.971
take my daughter
to the dance.

10:04.004 --> 10:06.473
I don't want one of
these hormonal creatures

10:06.506 --> 10:07.675
in this school
taking her.

10:07.708 --> 10:08.776
Huh, will you
think about it?

10:08.809 --> 10:09.777
Think about taking her.

10:09.810 --> 10:10.978
I don't... I don't--

10:11.011 --> 10:12.680
Just think about it,
just think about it.

10:12.713 --> 10:14.181
That's a kid!

10:14.214 --> 10:15.515
Thanks, Louie.

10:15.548 --> 10:16.684
I'll see you tomorrow
for potatoes.

10:16.717 --> 10:18.819
Yes, sir,
see you tomorrow.

10:18.852 --> 10:20.688
We were playing basketball
in Mike's driveway...

10:20.721 --> 10:22.622
Mm-hmm.
...and I had to take a piss.

10:22.656 --> 10:24.858
So I go upstairs,

10:24.892 --> 10:26.827
and I'm walking by
his parents bedroom.

10:26.860 --> 10:28.796
So the door is wide open

10:28.829 --> 10:31.598
and his mom is standing there
with just a skirt on.

10:31.631 --> 10:32.700
I saw her tits.

10:32.733 --> 10:35.035
No you didn't.

10:37.137 --> 10:38.672
What if I did?

10:38.706 --> 10:39.873
You didn't see
Mike's mom's tits.

10:39.907 --> 10:43.643
Just... stop.

10:43.677 --> 10:45.145
Thank you.

10:45.178 --> 10:46.379
Thanks.

10:46.413 --> 10:48.015
Are you going
to the dance?

10:48.048 --> 10:49.683
(sighing)
I don't know, man.

10:49.717 --> 10:50.851
I hate those.

10:50.884 --> 10:52.119
I mean,
you stand there,

10:52.152 --> 10:53.887
you have to wear,
like, a shirt,

10:53.921 --> 10:55.856
you ask
girls to dance.

10:55.889 --> 10:57.791
No one wants to dance.

10:57.825 --> 10:59.292
Last year at the dance,
some kid brought

10:59.326 --> 11:01.061
a jug of vodka.

11:01.094 --> 11:03.563
Vodka?

11:03.596 --> 11:05.733
Uh, can I get
my glasses?

11:05.766 --> 11:06.900
What for?

11:06.934 --> 11:11.238
Uh, I have a test
after lunch.

11:11.271 --> 11:13.006
(sighing)

11:13.040 --> 11:14.174
These ones
yours right here?

11:14.207 --> 11:15.142
Yeah, those.

11:15.175 --> 11:16.744
You gotta
give 'em back though.

11:16.777 --> 11:18.045
Of course.

11:18.078 --> 11:21.081
Hey, mush,
you got a problem?

11:21.114 --> 11:21.915
No.

11:21.949 --> 11:24.151
You want one?
What?

11:24.184 --> 11:25.819
Hold on a sec.

11:25.853 --> 11:27.755
I think I'm gonna
kick your ass.

11:27.788 --> 11:28.756
What do you think?

11:28.789 --> 11:30.023
Is that
a good idea?

11:30.057 --> 11:31.691
No, I don't think so.

11:31.725 --> 11:32.760
Oh, you don't?

11:32.793 --> 11:34.661
Why not?

11:34.694 --> 11:36.263
'Cause I wouldn't like it.

11:36.296 --> 11:38.932
Oh, okay, well,

11:38.966 --> 11:40.433
I'll give you
some options.

11:40.467 --> 11:43.370
I can hit you one time now,
then in like two, three weeks

11:43.403 --> 11:44.772
I'll hit you again.

11:44.805 --> 11:47.074
Like, you know,
spread it out over time.

11:47.107 --> 11:49.576
Or I can just kick the shit
out of you right now.

11:49.609 --> 11:50.844
What do you think?

11:50.878 --> 11:53.947
First one
sound good?

11:53.981 --> 11:55.615
I-- I'll do
the first one.

11:55.648 --> 11:58.919
All right, why don't you put
your tray down for a second?

12:03.824 --> 12:05.625
All right, good job.

12:05.658 --> 12:07.795
Uh, today's Wednesday.

12:07.828 --> 12:11.298
I'll see you
on the 21st.

12:26.847 --> 12:29.649
(Louie clearing throat)

12:29.682 --> 12:32.252
Hey, Laurie.

12:32.285 --> 12:33.320
Yeah?

12:33.353 --> 12:36.489
Um, are you going
to the dance?

12:36.523 --> 12:37.891
Yeah, why?

12:37.925 --> 12:40.660
Oh, I-- I just, uh,
thought, you know,

12:40.693 --> 12:42.095
if, uh-- if I go--

12:42.129 --> 12:44.764
I mean, if we go,
just, you know...

12:44.798 --> 12:48.836
If I go too, then...
we'll both be there?

12:48.869 --> 12:50.670
(snickering)
What?

12:50.703 --> 12:51.972
Like, I'll see
you there.

12:52.005 --> 12:53.406
It'll be like
you'll be there,

12:53.440 --> 12:55.809
I'll be there with you
being there.

12:55.843 --> 12:59.379
Like, together,
we'll both be there.

13:01.148 --> 13:03.817
So I'll see you
at the dance?

13:03.851 --> 13:06.854
Yeah, if you're going.

13:06.887 --> 13:09.823
Good.

13:09.857 --> 13:12.125
Okay...

13:15.362 --> 13:17.130
So, I, uh,

13:17.164 --> 13:19.766
I asked Laurie Sevetta
to the dance.

13:19.799 --> 13:21.301
She said yes.

13:21.334 --> 13:23.871
No she didn't.

13:23.904 --> 13:26.439
Yeah, she did.

13:26.473 --> 13:30.878
You're taking Laurie Sevetta
to the dance?

13:30.911 --> 13:33.914
Well, I'm meeting
her there.

13:36.149 --> 13:37.918
What?

13:39.853 --> 13:42.189
**

13:53.934 --> 13:55.335
(Louie's mother)
Hello?

13:55.368 --> 13:58.038
Hi, I'm in here.

14:02.175 --> 14:03.510
Hi.

14:03.543 --> 14:04.844
Hi, Mom.

14:04.878 --> 14:06.579
Oh, my God,
I'm so tired.

14:06.613 --> 14:09.983
Did you get a chance
to get yourself some dinner?

14:10.017 --> 14:11.718
Yeah, I made a hot dog.

14:11.751 --> 14:12.819
That sounds good.

14:12.852 --> 14:14.087
You want one?

14:14.121 --> 14:17.490
No, I'm--
I'm fine, thanks.

14:17.524 --> 14:19.927
What are you--

14:19.960 --> 14:22.762
Oh, my God,
the dance is tonight.

14:22.795 --> 14:25.432
Oh, Louie, I forgot.
Mom, it's all right.

14:25.465 --> 14:27.700
No, I was gonna
take you shopping

14:27.734 --> 14:28.902
for clothes for that.

14:28.936 --> 14:30.570
Mom, it's fine.

14:30.603 --> 14:32.772
I'll just wear a shirt,
I don't care.

14:32.805 --> 14:34.942
Okay.

14:34.975 --> 14:36.609
Do you need anything?

14:36.643 --> 14:38.611
You want $10
for after?

14:38.645 --> 14:39.846
(scoffing)
What after?

14:39.879 --> 14:40.948
I don't know.

14:40.981 --> 14:42.849
Don't you guys,
like, go get

14:42.882 --> 14:44.884
Chinese food
after the dance?

14:44.918 --> 14:45.885
Mm.

14:45.919 --> 14:47.854
Here, let me
give you $10.

14:47.887 --> 14:50.657
It'll make me feel like
less of a bad mom.

14:53.493 --> 14:55.462
Okay, thanks.

14:55.495 --> 14:57.797
It's a little--
it's a little weird.

14:57.830 --> 14:58.865
I'm just trying it on.
Oh...

14:58.898 --> 15:00.667
Okay.

15:03.570 --> 15:05.872
(boy)
Your shirt looks stupid
all striped.

15:05.905 --> 15:08.441
'Cause I hate you
'cause you're short.

15:08.475 --> 15:10.810
'Cause you're a little bitch,
get out of here.

15:10.843 --> 15:16.016
**

15:30.197 --> 15:32.432
Hey, Mr. Miner,
you look nice tonight.

15:32.465 --> 15:35.435
Thank you, girls.
(girls laughing)

16:13.573 --> 16:14.707
Come here.

16:14.741 --> 16:15.708
What do you want?

16:15.742 --> 16:18.945
Just come with me!
What?!

16:18.978 --> 16:20.780
Let's go!
What are we doing?

16:20.813 --> 16:23.383
Just wait.

16:23.416 --> 16:25.985
All right,
what are we doing?

16:26.019 --> 16:27.720
Doing this.

16:27.754 --> 16:29.056
Where did you get that?

16:29.089 --> 16:30.957
I stole it
from my brother.

16:30.990 --> 16:32.792
Holy shit.

16:32.825 --> 16:34.661
We're gonna
smoke this right now.

16:34.694 --> 16:36.829
We're gonna get high on pot.

16:36.863 --> 16:38.065
I never did that before.

16:38.098 --> 16:41.000
Me neither.

16:41.034 --> 16:43.770
Let's go to the woods.

16:53.613 --> 16:55.014
Whoa.
Ooh!

16:55.048 --> 16:56.816
Ah, cock!

16:56.849 --> 16:58.051
You stepped on a cock?

16:58.085 --> 16:59.686
Ow, Jesus.

16:59.719 --> 17:02.722
(laughing)

17:02.755 --> 17:05.658
Ah!

17:05.692 --> 17:06.926
(sighs)
Okay.

17:06.959 --> 17:08.428
Give me a light.

17:08.461 --> 17:09.996
Uh, I don't
have matches.

17:10.029 --> 17:11.764
Oh, shit!

17:11.798 --> 17:12.932
You didn't get matches?

17:12.965 --> 17:13.933
I didn't--
Boo!

17:13.966 --> 17:16.035
(sighing)

17:16.069 --> 17:19.539
Scared the shit out of
you two dipshits.

17:19.572 --> 17:20.740
Let's go.

17:20.773 --> 17:23.443
Wait, hold on.

17:23.476 --> 17:24.844
Can you
give us a light?

17:24.877 --> 17:26.113
What for?

17:26.146 --> 17:28.615
It's for this.

17:28.648 --> 17:29.916
Where'd you get that?

17:29.949 --> 17:32.452
It's mine.

17:32.485 --> 17:33.920
You know I can just kick
your ass right now

17:33.953 --> 17:35.955
and take it
from you, right?

17:35.988 --> 17:38.125
Yeah, you could.

17:38.158 --> 17:39.559
(sighing)
All right.

17:39.592 --> 17:42.229
Okay, we're gonna
share this, all right?

17:42.262 --> 17:44.864
Have you ever done this?

17:44.897 --> 17:49.502
**

18:02.149 --> 18:04.584
Need papers!

18:04.617 --> 18:06.486
You see, this is
supposed to be a horse.

18:06.519 --> 18:08.821
I don't see
a horse there.

18:08.855 --> 18:10.490
I need papers!

18:10.523 --> 18:13.160
Who's got papers
made of paper?

18:13.193 --> 18:14.894
Shut up, you clown.

18:14.927 --> 18:16.896
Stop it,
you stupid asshole.

18:16.929 --> 18:17.997
Whoo!

18:18.030 --> 18:19.299
You're making me
spill the pot.

18:19.332 --> 18:20.567
Jesus Christ, hey,
calm down, brat.

18:20.600 --> 18:23.770
Hey, when are you
gonna finish rolling that?

18:23.803 --> 18:28.475
I don't have papers!

18:28.508 --> 18:31.844
You guys
are such dicks.

18:31.878 --> 18:34.381
Stop it, you idiots!

18:38.385 --> 18:41.588
What the hell are you doing
on the floor?

18:41.621 --> 18:43.122
Let's go, buddy!

18:43.156 --> 18:44.591
I'm working on it!
Don't have all day.

18:44.624 --> 18:46.226
Come on!

18:47.894 --> 18:52.632
Can I have another?

18:52.665 --> 18:55.568
Yeah, just wait
a minute.

18:59.672 --> 19:02.875
**

19:06.579 --> 19:08.481
Hey.

19:09.816 --> 19:11.284
Hey.
Hmm, what?

19:11.318 --> 19:13.052
You okay?

19:13.085 --> 19:14.887
You seem tired.

19:14.921 --> 19:16.956
Yeah, I'm okay.

19:16.989 --> 19:18.991
Ah.

19:23.062 --> 19:27.334
**

19:40.012 --> 19:41.748
(man)
Excuse us!

19:41.781 --> 19:43.149
Excuse me.

19:43.182 --> 19:46.286
You didn't see us
standing here, young man?

19:53.793 --> 19:56.363
(bell ringing)

20:00.533 --> 20:03.936
(toilet flushing)

20:06.239 --> 20:07.674
What are we doing here?

20:07.707 --> 20:08.841
Doing science.

20:08.875 --> 20:10.777
Science, huh?

20:10.810 --> 20:11.944
We got any weed?

20:11.978 --> 20:13.380
No, I'm all out.

20:13.413 --> 20:15.715
What about you, man?
No, I'm out.

20:15.748 --> 20:17.417
(Louie)
Well, let's go
find Warren then.

20:17.450 --> 20:18.918
Warren just ran out too.

20:18.951 --> 20:20.387
Shit!

20:20.420 --> 20:21.788
Who else then?

20:21.821 --> 20:23.222
I don't know.

20:23.256 --> 20:24.957
Warren's the only one
who ever has any.

20:24.991 --> 20:26.225
Well, what about
your brother?

20:26.259 --> 20:28.127
He joined the Marines.

20:28.160 --> 20:29.462
Marines?

20:29.496 --> 20:31.197
All right, well,
where does Warren get it?

20:31.230 --> 20:32.632
From Jeff Davis.

20:32.665 --> 20:33.566
Jeff Davis?

20:33.600 --> 20:35.368
Well, let's go
ask him.

20:35.402 --> 20:36.903
I don't know, mush,
that guy's a drug dealer.

20:36.936 --> 20:38.305
For real.

20:38.338 --> 20:39.972
I know where he lives,
we can go hit him up.

20:40.006 --> 20:42.475
So you're just gonna
walk up to Jeff Davis' house

20:42.509 --> 20:44.811
and knock on his door?

20:44.844 --> 20:46.112
Yeah.
What is that?

20:46.145 --> 20:47.547
Quarter stick
of dynamite.

20:47.580 --> 20:49.816
Oh, shit!
Oh, shit!

20:54.487 --> 20:56.155
(all laughing)

20:56.188 --> 20:58.425
Holy shit!
Oh, my God.

21:01.361 --> 21:02.629
Oh, my God.

21:02.662 --> 21:04.931
What in the hell
was that?

21:04.964 --> 21:06.966
What in the hell was that?

21:06.999 --> 21:08.167
What is going on
in here?

21:08.200 --> 21:10.102
Who-- Did you do that?

21:10.136 --> 21:11.170
Did you,
was it you?

21:11.203 --> 21:13.172
What-- This flame,
did you do that?

21:13.205 --> 21:16.175
Was...

21:16.208 --> 21:17.276
Danny.

21:17.310 --> 21:20.079
What's up, Mr. Miner?

21:20.112 --> 21:21.681
All right, you boys
go to class.

21:21.714 --> 21:23.182
(Louie)
Someone will
take care of that?

21:23.215 --> 21:24.784
Get to class, go.

21:30.056 --> 21:31.791
God damn it.

21:47.540 --> 21:50.377
(footsteps approaching)

21:50.410 --> 21:51.878
What?

21:51.911 --> 21:54.013
What is this?

21:54.046 --> 21:55.548
What is this?

21:55.582 --> 21:57.650
Um... I was wondering

21:57.684 --> 22:01.988
if I could, uh,
make a purchase.

22:02.021 --> 22:05.057
(laughing)
You shitting me?

22:05.091 --> 22:07.193
I'm-- I'm sorry.

22:07.226 --> 22:08.395
What-- Who are you?

22:08.428 --> 22:09.462
Kid, come here,
come here.

22:09.496 --> 22:11.864
Come over here.

22:11.898 --> 22:14.901
Come over here, come on,
get over here.

22:14.934 --> 22:18.538
You know you got a lot of balls
coming up here like that?

22:18.571 --> 22:20.873
You know that?

22:20.907 --> 22:22.575
(coughs)

22:22.609 --> 22:25.578
You an asshole or what?

22:25.612 --> 22:27.947
You an asshole?

22:31.283 --> 22:33.052
Come on,
get in here.

22:35.388 --> 22:37.924
(Jeff)
Down here.

22:42.361 --> 22:44.931
Have a seat.

22:48.367 --> 22:49.702
(sighing)

22:49.736 --> 22:51.771
So, what's your name?

22:51.804 --> 22:53.239
Louie.

22:53.272 --> 22:55.341
Louie.

22:55.374 --> 22:57.910
All right, Louie.

22:57.944 --> 22:59.779
Here you are.

22:59.812 --> 23:01.280
How much?

23:01.313 --> 23:03.816
No, it's social.

23:08.721 --> 23:10.790
So, how old are you?

23:10.823 --> 23:14.293
Like... 13.

23:14.326 --> 23:16.696
Like 13?

23:16.729 --> 23:18.431
Thirteen.
(laughing)

23:18.465 --> 23:21.534
How old are you?

23:21.568 --> 23:23.736
Thirteen.

23:23.770 --> 23:27.640
Thirteen years,
Jesus Christ.

23:27.674 --> 23:31.478
I didn't smoke
weed until I was 20.

23:31.511 --> 23:33.546
Hey, look, I'm not lecturing
you or anything.

23:33.580 --> 23:36.449
I mean, you make
your choices, right?

23:36.483 --> 23:38.317
I don't know
your life.

23:38.350 --> 23:41.454
You know mine?

23:41.488 --> 23:43.255
No, I...

23:43.289 --> 23:44.991
I don't know yours...
Yeah.

23:45.024 --> 23:46.258
What your life is.

23:46.292 --> 23:47.460
No, you don't.

23:47.494 --> 23:50.296
You don't--
Piece of shit.

23:50.329 --> 23:51.330
Piece of shit.

23:51.363 --> 23:52.331
Can I have
that lighter?

23:52.364 --> 23:54.467
Let me see that,
thank you.

23:54.501 --> 23:56.903
You don't know mine.

23:56.936 --> 23:58.605
Yeah, right?

23:58.638 --> 23:59.772
You never know.

23:59.806 --> 24:02.642
Look at all this shit,
look at this.

24:02.675 --> 24:04.511
All this, this is, uh,

24:04.544 --> 24:07.680
this is nothing,
this is no big deal, right?

24:07.714 --> 24:10.116
This is like a plant
that grows in the ground.

24:10.149 --> 24:11.350
It's, uh...

24:11.383 --> 24:13.185
Look, what if we, uh,
took a mulberry bush

24:13.219 --> 24:14.621
and put it
in some papers?

24:14.654 --> 24:16.255
Think people would
give a shit?

24:16.288 --> 24:18.791
No.

24:18.825 --> 24:22.294
Maybe the mulberry bush
wouldn't like it.

24:24.030 --> 24:26.499
(chuckling)

24:26.533 --> 24:29.368
You're a pisser.

24:29.401 --> 24:31.270
All right,
how much you want?

24:31.303 --> 24:32.705
Um...

24:32.739 --> 24:36.008
I-- I don't know,
just some pot.

24:37.744 --> 24:39.311
All right, look,

24:39.345 --> 24:42.048
a quarter ounce
is ten bucks.

24:44.584 --> 24:45.718
Do you want that?

24:45.752 --> 24:46.819
You want that.
Yeah.

24:46.853 --> 24:49.556
Yeah, you want that.
Good.

24:49.589 --> 24:50.723
Come on,
you piece of shit.

24:50.757 --> 24:53.726
Piece of shit scale.

24:53.760 --> 24:58.330
They have scales
just like that at my school.

24:58.364 --> 24:59.732
That right?

24:59.766 --> 25:02.401
Yeah, in science class.

25:02.434 --> 25:04.236
Just like that one.

25:04.270 --> 25:06.405
Ah...

25:06.438 --> 25:09.508
Whoop-dee.

25:09.542 --> 25:11.844
Eh...

25:11.878 --> 25:15.047
Ah, pff.

25:15.081 --> 25:17.083
Here you are.

25:17.116 --> 25:21.654
Mission accomplished--
Just set it there.

25:21.688 --> 25:24.256
Thanks for the, uh...

25:24.290 --> 25:26.726
Yeah.

25:26.759 --> 25:29.361
All right, so, uh...

25:31.931 --> 25:35.267

25:35.301 --> 25:36.703
You s--
You, uh...

25:36.736 --> 25:39.205
Can you get me one of those
scales from your school?

25:39.238 --> 25:41.741
Is that what we're saying?

25:41.774 --> 25:44.677
I can try.
Don't answer, don't answer.

25:44.711 --> 25:46.278
Why don't you--

25:46.312 --> 25:50.249
You get me one of those scales,
I'll give you two ounces for it.

25:50.282 --> 25:52.218
I mean, I know a lot of guys
that need these,

25:52.251 --> 25:54.386
so I could turn 'em over.

25:54.420 --> 25:56.623
So, uh...

25:56.656 --> 25:57.757
As many
as you can get?

25:57.790 --> 25:59.291
Is that what we're saying?

25:59.325 --> 26:01.594
Don't answer,
just think about it, all right?

26:01.628 --> 26:02.695
Just think about it.

26:02.729 --> 26:05.632
You wanna do it,
you just do it.

26:05.665 --> 26:06.866
All right?

26:06.899 --> 26:08.100
You don't want
to do it, you go about

26:08.134 --> 26:10.269
your fairy merry way,
I don't care.

26:10.302 --> 26:11.537
You understand?

26:11.570 --> 26:12.571
Okay.

26:12.605 --> 26:13.640
All right,
you're a good kid.

26:13.673 --> 26:14.907
Thanks.

26:14.941 --> 26:16.308
Hey, look, don't bring
anybody over here.

26:16.342 --> 26:17.610
I don't like people.

26:17.644 --> 26:18.811
And whatever you do,
don't get caught.

26:18.845 --> 26:20.379
Don't be stupid.
Gotcha.

26:20.412 --> 26:22.381
All right?

26:22.414 --> 26:24.083
Thanks.

26:24.116 --> 26:25.952
Thanks again.

26:25.985 --> 26:28.154
Don't bring anybody

Just you.

26:37.496 --> 26:42.234

26:44.103 --> 26:45.337

26:45.371 --> 26:47.406

Awesome.
Cool.

27:29.849 --> 27:31.217
Okay, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

27:31.250 --> 27:32.719
What did we learn?

27:32.752 --> 27:34.286
That you're crazy?

27:34.320 --> 27:35.354
(class laughing)

27:35.387 --> 27:36.889
Okay,

27:36.923 --> 27:38.390
Good observation.

27:38.424 --> 27:40.893
Okay, go ahead,

27:43.262 --> 27:45.464
(laughing)
Wow.

Oh, what a mess.

27:47.399 --> 27:48.735
That was fun, huh?

27:48.768 --> 27:50.302
Yeah.

27:50.336 --> 27:51.570
It's really fun.

27:51.603 --> 27:55.407
Hey, so how you feeling about,
uh, high school coming up?

27:55.441 --> 27:57.543
(sighing)
I don't know.

27:57.576 --> 27:59.178
Not too excited
about science?

27:59.211 --> 28:00.747
There's gonna be a lot--
Hey, Dad.

28:00.780 --> 28:02.581
Oh, hey, Danielle.

Oh, sorry.

Hi.
(clearing throat)

28:12.291 --> 28:14.093
Honey, I gotta clean
this up before we can go.

28:14.126 --> 28:16.595
But ballet starts
at 3:00.

28:16.628 --> 28:17.764
I can take care of it.

28:17.797 --> 28:19.766
Yeah?
Yeah, no problem.

28:19.799 --> 28:22.201
Um... okay.

28:22.234 --> 28:25.104
Well, just put everything back
in the supply closet,

28:25.137 --> 28:26.739
clean up the egg.
Yeah.

28:26.773 --> 28:28.407
Yeah, you don't mind?

28:28.440 --> 28:29.408
No, not at all.

Okay, great, thanks.

You wanna go out

30:18.384 --> 30:19.385
No.

30:19.418 --> 30:21.287
Hey, I'm buying.

30:21.320 --> 30:22.388
No thanks.

30:22.421 --> 30:26.325
Hey, what is going on?

30:26.358 --> 30:27.526
What?

30:27.559 --> 30:29.728
What is going on?

30:29.761 --> 30:31.297
Something is up

30:31.330 --> 30:33.432
Nothing!

30:39.671 --> 30:42.441
Hey, hey!
