SHEPPARD :
Élizabeth, we may have a situation.

00:04.527 --> 00:08.042
Major Leonard’s team,
they’re late returning from M1 B-129.

00:08.207 --> 00:10.596
We sent them to check out
an unusual energy reading.

00:10.767 --> 00:13.406
An anomalous spike the M.A.L.P.
picked up on a gate scout.

00:13.567 --> 00:15.956
The planet’s uninhabited
but warranted a closer look.

00:16.126 --> 00:19.199
SHEPPARD : The point is they missed a
check-in. They’re now six hours overdue.

00:19.367 --> 00:21.278
McKAY : We’ve tried contacting them
by the radio...

00:21.447 --> 00:23.403
... but the signal is intermittent
at best.

00:23.567 --> 00:26.604
Just a lot of static. Could have
something to do with the anomaly.

00:26.767 --> 00:28.837
SHEPPARD : l wanna take our team,
go see what happened.

00:29.007 --> 00:31.077
Of course.
Take an additional marine unit...

00:31.247 --> 00:33.807
... and the good Dr. Beckett,
just in case.

These things are useless.

00:56.327 --> 00:58.363
l’m picking up
that puzzling energy reading.

00:58.527 --> 01:01.564
- What is it ?
- Did l not just use the word puzzling ?

01:01.727 --> 01:03.445
Charming.

01:04.047 --> 01:07.198
Tracks. Boot prints.

01:07.967 --> 01:09.764
Let’s go find them.

01:14.727 --> 01:16.319
McKAY :
The readings are stronger.

01:16.487 --> 01:18.876
Whatever it is, we’re getting warmer.

01:19.047 --> 01:20.685
TEYLA :
Look.

01:27.967 --> 01:30.481
- Genii.
BECKETT : He’s been dead for months.

01:30.887 --> 01:32.400
No, really ?

01:32.567 --> 01:34.797
Okay, we know our guys didn’t do it.

01:34.967 --> 01:37.925
And he wasn’t fed on,
so it wasn’t the Wraith.

01:38.127 --> 01:40.357
Bullet wounds. Dozens of them.

01:40.567 --> 01:41.966

Over here.

01:51.687 --> 01:55.475
- Also shot.
- This guy was stabbed. Repeatedly.

01:55.687 --> 01:57.405
By this guy, it looks like.

01:57.607 --> 01:59.484
So they killed each other ?

01:59.887 --> 02:01.320
BECKETT :
Aye.

02:01.487 --> 02:06.322
Quite possibly. And by the looks of it,
in a violent fashion.

02:06.487 --> 02:08.955
Which begs the question :

02:09.127 --> 02:12.005
What the hell happened
to Major Leonard’s team ?

03:15.527 --> 03:17.245
DEX : l thought this planet
was uninhabited.

03:17.407 --> 03:18.965
McKAY :
According to the Ancient database.

03:19.167 --> 03:21.886
Well, it recently became habited.

03:22.047 --> 03:25.039
Do you suppose the Genii are
responsible for the energy readings ?

03:25.207 --> 03:28.597
Probably. Be our luck if we stumble
on one of their nuclear testing sites.

03:28.807 --> 03:32.561
- Nuclear testing site ?
- Just a small one.

03:34.807 --> 03:36.399
What is it ?

03:38.487 --> 03:39.715
l saw something.

03:41.607 --> 03:44.519
Well, what ? Person ? Animal ?

03:44.687 --> 03:47.645
- How many syllables ?
TEYLA : What is it ?

03:48.127 --> 03:49.401

03:53.447 --> 03:55.324
It’s probably nothing.

Oh, for God’s sake.
Enough with the bodies.

05:08.127 --> 05:10.322
BECKETT :
Quite possibly...

05:10.647 --> 05:12.683

05:15.247 --> 05:17.556
It appears to have been
abandoned for some time.

05:17.727 --> 05:21.356
Genii probably stumbled onto it
just like we did.

05:21.527 --> 05:24.121
- And then promptly killed each other.
- Why ?

05:24.327 --> 05:26.716

In here.

05:26.927 --> 05:28.918
All right. We’Il check it out.

the immediate area around the cave.

05:49.647 --> 05:51.285
It appears to be organic.

05:51.447 --> 05:53.722
McKAY : It’s like the energy conduit
aboard a Wraith ship.

05:53.887 --> 05:55.764
And every bit as disgusting.

05:55.927 --> 05:57.519

SHEPPARD : This thing’s still active ?
McKAY : Apparently so.

06:10.167 --> 06:14.445
- Actively doing what, exactly ?
McKAY : It’s some sort of E.M. generator.

06:14.607 --> 06:18.486
It’s emitting a modulated
ultra-low frequency pulse.

06:18.647 --> 06:22.196
These energy conduits
are acting almost like antennae.

06:22.367 --> 06:24.642
BECKETT : Is that interfering
with the radio communications ?

06:24.807 --> 06:25.796
Probably.

06:25.967 --> 06:29.642
The Genii must have found this,
activated it, couldn’t turn it off.

06:29.807 --> 06:33.561
So they did what any other good
soldier would do in their situation.

06:33.767 --> 06:35.439
Shot the hell out of it.

06:35.607 --> 06:37.359
BECKETT :
Looks like it’s healing itself.

That’s the beauty
of hybrid organic design.

06:39.647 --> 06:41.717

06:41.927 --> 06:45.124
No, it’s doubtful, apart from
the obvious sterility issues.

- What ?
- He’s kidding.

06:48.047 --> 06:49.924

- l don’t know.
- We were unable to locate his body.
