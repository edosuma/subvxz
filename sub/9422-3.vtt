WEBVTT

00:01.101 --> 00:02.969
Previously on
dirty sexy money...

00:03.036 --> 00:05.038
I get that it was
an accident, Patrick,

00:05.105 --> 00:07.040
but we still have to call
the police.
I mean, if this gets out,
the election--that'll be done.

00:07.107 --> 00:09.977
Dad wants me to write
a heartfelt eulogy

00:10.043 --> 00:12.980
for Ellen's memorial--thinks
it'll clinch the election--

00:13.046 --> 00:15.048
and all I can think about
is Carmelita.
Who's this prosecutor
they got on mom's case?

00:15.115 --> 00:16.984
(Nick) A real pit bull.
This is her?

00:17.050 --> 00:19.019
You hooked up with me
and then arrested my mom.

00:19.086 --> 00:21.021
No one will ever find out.

00:21.088 --> 00:24.024
What you do to me,
it scares me a little, you know?

00:24.091 --> 00:26.059
But I like it.
We've got her.

00:26.126 --> 00:29.029
You really expect him
to defend the woman

00:29.096 --> 00:31.965
who's accused of murdering
his father?
I'll take the case.

00:32.031 --> 00:34.001
Ladies and gentlemen,
the new vice chair

00:34.067 --> 00:37.004
of Darling enterprises--
Nick George.

00:37.070 --> 00:39.940
Do you think it's because
you took the case?
Lisa, I didn't know.

00:40.007 --> 00:41.942
Someday, Nick, you're gonna
have to make a choice

00:42.009 --> 00:44.044
between their family and ours.
I hope you choose us.

00:48.115 --> 00:50.984
And if elected to the senate,

00:51.051 --> 00:54.955
I will fight to protect you all
from a similar, fiery fate.

00:55.022 --> 00:57.958
I will make it my goal
that no parent or child,

00:58.025 --> 01:00.027
no husband or wife,
shall ever have to take

01:00.093 --> 01:02.029
that dreaded late-night call
and...

01:02.095 --> 01:04.965
(Camera shutters clicking)

01:05.032 --> 01:07.034
And, uh...

01:07.100 --> 01:10.003
(Crowd murmurs)

01:10.070 --> 01:12.940
And experience the anguish

01:13.006 --> 01:16.977
that all of us who loved
my dear wife Ellen felt

01:17.044 --> 01:18.946
three weeks ago.

01:19.012 --> 01:20.981
No one.

01:21.048 --> 01:23.016
Thank you.

01:25.052 --> 01:27.020
Thank you very much.

01:27.087 --> 01:29.056
That's Patrick Darling,
speaking here today

01:29.122 --> 01:30.991
about stricter fire codes

01:31.058 --> 01:33.026
in the wake
of that recent tragedy

01:33.093 --> 01:36.029
that claimed
the life of his wife.

01:36.096 --> 01:37.998
That's a good speech.

01:38.065 --> 01:39.967
Thanks. I'm so proud.

01:40.033 --> 01:42.970
Patrick, there's nothing wrong
with keeping people safe.

01:43.036 --> 01:44.037
(Scoffs) I know that, Nick.

01:44.104 --> 01:47.040
But my dad's got me pimping
my wife's death for votes

01:47.107 --> 01:49.977
as if she really even died
in a fire.

01:50.043 --> 01:52.012
I mean, you saw me in there.
I'm falling apart.

01:52.079 --> 01:55.949
Listen, why'd you really
ask me down here?
Nick, what if I...

01:56.016 --> 01:57.985
What if I came clean?

01:58.051 --> 01:59.987
Well, how clean, exactly?

02:00.053 --> 02:02.022
Well, what if we go
to the cops and tell them

02:02.089 --> 02:04.024
that Ellen tried to kill me
but died accidentally,

02:04.091 --> 02:06.026
and to avoid a scandal,

02:06.093 --> 02:08.027
we had Clarky
take the body up to Valhalla,

02:08.095 --> 02:10.964
and he's the one
that torched the place?

02:11.031 --> 02:14.001
You know, what if we...
Told the truth?
Patrick, you could face charges

02:14.067 --> 02:17.037
for obstruction of justice
and for arson.
You think I'd really
do time, though?

02:17.104 --> 02:21.008
I don't know.
It's hard to say.
All right. Great.
Let's do it. You set that up?

02:21.074 --> 02:23.010
Wait a minute. Patrick,
I just took the job

02:23.076 --> 02:25.946
defending your mother for
allegedly murdering my father.

02:26.013 --> 02:28.949
When it comes to
Darling felonies, I'm booked.
I don't care, okay?

02:29.016 --> 02:30.951
My dad may think
it's a great strategy,

02:31.018 --> 02:33.020
selling my fake sorrow
for votes,

02:33.086 --> 02:35.022
but I can't show up
at that debate tomorrow night

02:35.088 --> 02:37.024
and perpetuate this lie
on national television.

02:37.090 --> 02:39.059
I mean, this has got to end.

02:39.126 --> 02:42.963
All right. Look,
I'll see what I can do.

02:43.030 --> 02:45.065
Great. Thanks a lot, Nick.

02:48.035 --> 02:50.070
(Engine turns over)

02:56.043 --> 02:59.012
Tripp, we've got a problem.

02:59.079 --> 03:00.981
(Nola) What to wear...

03:01.048 --> 03:02.983
(The weepies'
"all that I want" playing)

03:03.050 --> 03:04.017
Yeah.

03:04.084 --> 03:06.987
What are you up to today,
exactly?

03:07.054 --> 03:09.022
Oh, you know,
same old, same old--

03:09.089 --> 03:11.024
prosecuting your mother
for murder.

03:11.091 --> 03:13.994
Mm. You like the weepies
a lot, huh?

03:14.061 --> 03:15.028
Yeah.

03:15.095 --> 03:17.030
I also like guys
who don't touch...

03:17.097 --> 03:18.966
(Music stops)
My stuff.

03:19.032 --> 03:21.034
They're playing
at Irving Plaza this weekend.

03:21.101 --> 03:23.971
Maybe we can catch
one of their shows.

03:24.037 --> 03:25.973
Jeremy, please consult
your owner's manual.

03:26.039 --> 03:28.942
You and me are only you and me
within these four walls, okay?

03:29.009 --> 03:31.044
We don't go window-shopping
on fifth Avenue,

03:31.111 --> 03:33.981
we don't go to brunch
with your friends,

03:34.047 --> 03:35.983
and we do not gout
to see the weepies.

03:36.049 --> 03:37.985
Now if you'll excuse me,
I've gotta go see a man

03:38.051 --> 03:39.119
about a murder.

03:43.090 --> 03:44.992
Good morning, Nick.

03:45.058 --> 03:46.994
Well, we're about to find out

03:47.060 --> 03:48.996
if it's a good morning
or not, Daisy.

03:49.062 --> 03:51.932
Did the prosecution's
witness list get here yet?
Nope, no sign of it.

03:51.999 --> 03:54.001
Then it is. Call judge wyeth
and let her know

03:54.067 --> 03:57.004
that nola lyons just violated
her first court order.

03:57.070 --> 03:59.940
Violated?
Give a girl a break.

04:00.007 --> 04:01.975
Ms. lyons is here
to see you.

04:02.042 --> 04:03.977
Thank you, Daisy.

04:04.044 --> 04:05.979
Keeping your busted
little office

04:06.046 --> 04:07.981
doesn't mean
you haven't sold out.

04:08.048 --> 04:11.952
You know that, right?
Just give me the witness list.

04:12.019 --> 04:14.021
What, you couldn't have sent
a process server?

04:14.087 --> 04:15.989
No. It's a little delicate.

04:16.055 --> 04:17.991
There's a name on this list

04:18.058 --> 04:20.928
that you're not gonna be
very happy with.

04:20.994 --> 04:23.096
It's someone you haven't seen
in over 30 years.

04:26.066 --> 04:28.936
What the hell
are you doing, nola?

04:29.002 --> 04:32.005
Your mother's
my star witness, Nick.

04:32.072 --> 04:34.942
Anything in her testimony
will be completely irrelevant.

04:35.008 --> 04:37.010
She hasn't communicated
to any of us--
not true.

04:37.077 --> 04:39.046
Your mother was the last person
to speak to your father

04:39.112 --> 04:41.014
the day he was murdered.

04:41.081 --> 04:44.017
And as you will see on page 17
of the murder book,

04:44.084 --> 04:46.019
I've discovered hundreds
of wire transfers

04:46.086 --> 04:48.055
your mother's received
from guess who.

04:48.121 --> 04:50.057
Letitia Darling.

04:50.123 --> 04:53.060
Payments Letitia continues
to make to this day.

04:53.126 --> 04:55.062
Payments for what?

04:55.128 --> 04:57.064
You tell me, Nick.

04:57.130 --> 05:01.034
You tell moi.

05:02.102 --> 05:03.971
I don’t get it.

05:04.037 --> 05:06.039
Why didn’t grandpa name you
as his successor, dad?

05:06.106 --> 05:08.041
You said you were
his right-hand man.

05:08.108 --> 05:11.044
Yeah, well,
maybe he's a lefty.

05:11.111 --> 05:13.981
So how's Brazil, shrimp?
Very hot.

05:14.047 --> 05:15.949
(Beeping)
Hang on a second.

05:16.016 --> 05:17.951
Hey, what the hell?
Hey, we're talking.

05:18.018 --> 05:20.020
Ill be right back.

05:21.989 --> 05:23.924
What is that ball of crap?

05:23.991 --> 05:25.025
Chicken Empadeo.

05:25.092 --> 05:27.995
That's your dinner?
Where's your mother?

05:28.061 --> 05:29.997
She's.. Busy right now.

05:30.063 --> 05:31.999
Is she not there?

05:32.065 --> 05:35.035
She's here.
She's just... resting.

05:35.102 --> 05:38.005
She left you by yourself
at night?

05:38.071 --> 05:40.974
No.
Mrs. Volkmann checks in.

05:41.041 --> 05:42.042
Mrs. Volkmann?

05:42.109 --> 05:44.044
The wife of a war criminal
checks in?

05:44.111 --> 05:46.980
What a relief.
I can take care
of myself, dad.

05:47.047 --> 05:48.982
That’s fine,
but you shouldn’t have to.

05:49.049 --> 05:50.984
You know what? That’s it!
I am coming down there.

05:51.051 --> 05:53.020
And you tell
that absentee mother of yours

05:53.086 --> 05:57.024
when she gets home from her
night of grilled beef and samba

05:57.090 --> 05:59.092
that her little
Brazilian carnival is over!

06:03.096 --> 06:06.099
(Classical piano music playing)

06:12.105 --> 06:15.943
Oh! (Laughs)
How embarrassing--

06:16.009 --> 06:20.013
you catching me
butchering chopin like that.

06:22.015 --> 06:24.017
What's wrong?
What happened?

06:27.087 --> 06:29.990
Le vivier-sur-mer...

06:30.057 --> 06:31.992
It's a village in France.

06:32.059 --> 06:33.994
You must have heard of it.

06:34.061 --> 06:36.029
You've been sending checks
there for years.

06:36.096 --> 06:39.032
(Whispers) Oh, my God.

06:39.099 --> 06:42.002
(Normal voice) I don't know
what clare told you, but--

06:42.069 --> 06:44.004
well, she hasn't told me
anything, Letitia.

06:44.071 --> 06:46.974
I haven't spoken to my mother
in 30 years.
Then how did you find out?

06:47.040 --> 06:48.976
The witness list.

06:49.042 --> 06:52.079
She's been called as a witness
in the case against you.

06:55.015 --> 06:57.017
You paid to send her away?

06:57.084 --> 06:58.986
No, no, it--
it wasn't like that.

06:59.052 --> 07:01.989
Well, by all means,
tell me what it was like,

07:02.055 --> 07:03.924
because I'd love to know.

07:03.991 --> 07:06.026
I offered her a place to live
and a tiny little stipend.

07:06.093 --> 07:09.062
So what, you could have
my father all to yourself?

07:09.129 --> 07:11.031
No! Oh, Nicky...

07:11.098 --> 07:13.934
(Sighs) You don't understand.

07:14.001 --> 07:17.037
She--she was unhappy.
Well, of course
she was unhappy, Letitia.

07:17.104 --> 07:19.973
You were sleeping
with her husband.

07:20.040 --> 07:21.975
It started long before that.

07:22.042 --> 07:23.977
(Sighs) You know, today,
they'd call her,

07:24.044 --> 07:26.013
I don't know, bipolar.

07:26.079 --> 07:28.015
At the very least,
she was depressed,

07:28.081 --> 07:30.951
and for a young child
to be around that--

07:31.018 --> 07:32.953
(laughs)
Let me get this straight.

07:33.020 --> 07:36.056
You--you paid my mother off
30 years ago to help me.

07:36.123 --> 07:38.025
That's your story?

07:38.091 --> 07:41.028
She wanted the money.

07:41.094 --> 07:44.031
She wanted to leave.
She wanted the money.

07:44.097 --> 07:46.967
It was her idea, not mine.

07:47.034 --> 07:48.035
I'm sorry, Nicky.

07:48.101 --> 07:51.038
If you don't believe me,
ask her yourself.

07:54.074 --> 07:55.976
(European telephone rings)

07:56.043 --> 07:56.977
(Ring)

07:57.044 --> 07:58.946
(Woman) Hello?

07:59.012 --> 08:01.982
Uh, yeah, hello.

08:02.049 --> 08:03.050
Is this clare?

08:03.116 --> 08:07.020
Yes, who's calling?

08:07.087 --> 08:09.089
It's Nick.

08:11.124 --> 08:14.027
Nick George.

08:16.063 --> 08:17.931
Your son.

08:17.998 --> 08:18.999
Where are you?

08:19.066 --> 08:21.935
I'm in New York.

08:22.002 --> 08:24.004
I am calling you because you're
on the witness list

08:24.071 --> 08:26.006
for Letitia Darling's
murder trial,

08:26.073 --> 08:28.008
and I am defending her.
I can't talk about this.

08:28.075 --> 08:31.011
I just want to ask you a few--
don't call me again.

08:31.078 --> 08:32.946
(Line disconnects)

08:33.013 --> 08:34.948
(Dial tone drones)

08:35.015 --> 08:36.082
(Hangs up receiver)

08:38.085 --> 08:43.957
♪♪♪

08:54.101 --> 08:55.969
You okay?

08:56.036 --> 08:59.039
Were you listening in
on the call?
A little.

08:59.106 --> 09:02.976
Then you know how I am.

09:03.043 --> 09:05.045
Thank you.

09:05.112 --> 09:07.981
Do you want
the good news first

09:08.048 --> 09:09.983
or the bad news?
How about the good?

09:10.050 --> 09:13.020
I booked you on a flight
to Paris for tonight

09:13.086 --> 09:16.023
in case you don't want
to take no for an answer.

09:16.089 --> 09:18.025
And what's the bad news?
I hate to interrupt

09:18.091 --> 09:20.961
your takeover
of Darling enterprises...

09:21.028 --> 09:23.964
Brian Darling is here.
But I need some legal advice.

09:24.031 --> 09:25.032
Thank you, Daisy.

09:25.098 --> 09:27.067
(Whispers)
Walk with me.

09:29.102 --> 09:31.038
Look,
I'm not exactly an expert

09:31.104 --> 09:33.040
in international
child custody law, Brian.

09:33.106 --> 09:35.976
But just because Andrea
might be partying every night

09:36.043 --> 09:38.045
doesn't mean that you can take
your son out of the country

09:38.111 --> 09:40.013
or even out of her house
without her consent.

09:40.080 --> 09:43.050
But you know he'd be better off
here in New York with me.

09:43.116 --> 09:46.019
You know he would.
It doesn't matter.
She's got full custody.

09:46.086 --> 09:48.956
Yeah, and whose fault
is that?
Yours, for bribing
the arbitrator last year,

09:49.022 --> 09:50.958
thereby ensuring that Andrea
would get full custody.

09:51.024 --> 09:54.027
You know, your moral superiority
was always pretty sickening.

09:54.094 --> 09:55.996
But since you stole
the company

09:56.063 --> 09:57.998
out from under every other kid
in the family,

09:58.065 --> 10:00.033
it really doesn't fly!
That is not true, Brian...

10:00.100 --> 10:03.971
Taxi!
And you know that. I was
just as surprised as you were.

10:04.037 --> 10:06.039
(Woman) Taxi! Taxi. Hel--
I'm going to Brazil.

10:06.106 --> 10:08.008
Tell your benefactor
I'll be in touch.

10:08.075 --> 10:10.944
All right. Well, don't do
anything stupid, all right?

10:11.011 --> 10:12.946
No, I wouldn't
dream of it, boss.

10:13.013 --> 10:15.015
That's my--
move.

10:15.082 --> 10:18.051
I'm sorry.
Mm.

10:20.087 --> 10:21.989
I'm astounded.

10:22.055 --> 10:23.924
Nick ratted me out?

10:23.991 --> 10:26.927
You should thank him, paddy.
He did you a favor.

10:26.994 --> 10:29.997
This conversation is gonna
save you a lot of regrets.
Come on.

10:30.063 --> 10:33.934
How can I have any more regrets
than I have right now?

10:34.001 --> 10:35.969
I mean, how could I put
my kids to sleep at night

10:36.036 --> 10:37.971
telling them to pray
to their mommy in heaven

10:38.038 --> 10:40.040
knowing that I--
knowing you what?

10:40.107 --> 10:43.977
I just want to tell
the truth.

10:44.044 --> 10:45.012
Oh, yeah.

10:45.078 --> 10:47.014
And what about everyone else

10:47.080 --> 10:52.052
who was involved in this,
um, situation?

10:52.119 --> 10:54.988
What about Carmelita?

10:55.055 --> 10:56.957
What about her?

10:57.024 --> 10:58.926
Well, she's your mistress,
isn't she?

10:58.992 --> 11:01.995
Or she was
until she disappeared.

11:02.062 --> 11:04.965
You don't think this will draw
the tabloids' attention to her?

11:05.032 --> 11:07.000
So what, dad? You just
want me to keep on lying?

11:07.067 --> 11:09.036
Damn it, Patrick.
This is not a lie.

11:09.102 --> 11:13.974
Your life with Ellen,
that was a lie.
I know that, dad, and I want
my life with Carmelita,

11:14.041 --> 11:15.976
when I find her,
not to be.

11:16.043 --> 11:18.979
Oh, terrific.
Now I want to tell the truth,

11:19.046 --> 11:22.049
and that's exactly what I plan
to do in the debate on Friday,

11:22.115 --> 11:24.051
and let the chips fall
as they may.

11:24.117 --> 11:26.053
At least then,
my conscience will be clear.

11:26.119 --> 11:28.956
Maybe you don't remember
what that feels like,

11:29.022 --> 11:31.058
but I still do.

11:37.130 --> 11:39.066
How long has your mom
lived in France?

11:39.132 --> 11:42.002
Well, ever since
she split up with my dad

11:42.069 --> 11:43.937
and left New York,

11:44.004 --> 11:46.006
so, uh, 33 years.

11:46.073 --> 11:48.008
Well, how come
we never visited?

11:48.075 --> 11:50.043
Kiki, let your dad
finish packing, okay?

11:50.110 --> 11:52.045
You know, actually,
I tried once

11:52.112 --> 11:54.047
after I graduated
from high school

11:54.114 --> 11:56.049
because I just--
I wanted to see her

11:56.116 --> 11:58.051
because I was starting
to forget her face.

11:58.118 --> 12:01.054
And, uh, you know,
we exchanged some letters,

12:01.121 --> 12:03.991
and she asked me to meet her
in Paris at sainte-chapelle,

12:04.057 --> 12:05.993
which is
this gothic cathedral.

12:06.059 --> 12:08.929
And I went there,
sat and waited,

12:08.996 --> 12:10.030
and she never showed up.

12:10.097 --> 12:12.032
And you never
heard from her?

12:12.099 --> 12:13.934
Nope.

12:14.001 --> 12:16.003
Well, I think she'll be
happy to see you.

12:16.069 --> 12:18.939
After all,
she has to be proud, right?

12:19.006 --> 12:20.974
I mean, you're, like,
famous now,

12:21.041 --> 12:23.110
because of the Darlings.

12:26.046 --> 12:28.115
I need some more socks.

12:33.020 --> 12:34.955
What's going on?
What's the problem?

12:35.022 --> 12:36.957
Nothing. It's just,
you know how many times

12:37.024 --> 12:38.992
I've tried to get you
to reconnect with your mom?

12:39.059 --> 12:40.994
I suggested it
when we got engaged,

12:41.061 --> 12:43.030
then I suggested it again
after Kiki was born.

12:43.096 --> 12:45.999
So I'm going now.
What's the problem?
There's no problem, Nick.

12:46.066 --> 12:48.969
It's just one more thing
you'll do for the Darlings

12:49.036 --> 12:50.971
that you won't do for me.
(Scoffs)

12:51.038 --> 12:53.040
Have a safe flight.

13:05.798 --> 13:08.801
♪♪♪

13:15.808 --> 13:18.778
Brian.
What are you doing here?

13:18.845 --> 13:20.780
I came to see my son.

13:20.847 --> 13:24.835
You flew 6,000 Miles
spur-of-the-moment?

13:24.902 --> 13:26.904
Yeah, thought I'd
check in with the shrimp,

13:26.971 --> 13:28.939
you know, kinda...
Enjoy the nightlife.

13:29.006 --> 13:30.908
What are you talking about?

13:30.975 --> 13:33.911
Nothing. Just that I hear
there's a lot of things

13:33.978 --> 13:36.914
you can do here at night,
out of the house.

13:36.981 --> 13:38.949
He'll be home from school
at 4:00.

13:39.016 --> 13:40.985
You can come back then.

13:43.988 --> 13:45.990
What are you looking at?

13:48.025 --> 13:51.862
And Nick was so coy
when daddy announced

13:51.929 --> 13:53.864
that Nick was gonna
take over the company.

13:53.931 --> 13:55.933
He was, like... (Gasps)
"Oh, oh, m-me?

13:56.000 --> 13:58.903
Little old me? Unh."

13:58.969 --> 14:00.905
You should've been there.

14:00.971 --> 14:02.940
I almost feel like I was.

14:03.007 --> 14:04.942
I'm sorry.
Am I boring you?

14:05.009 --> 14:06.877
No. No, no, no.

14:06.944 --> 14:08.879
I always enjoy
week long monologues

14:08.946 --> 14:11.949
about my girlfriend's ex.
It made me mad, that's all.

14:12.016 --> 14:13.884
I understand that.

14:13.951 --> 14:15.920
What I don't understand

14:15.986 --> 14:18.856
is the pleasure you get from
dwelling on it continuously,

14:18.923 --> 14:20.925
at the expense of everything,
including us.

14:20.991 --> 14:23.928
Karen, Nick has shown you
in a number of ways,

14:23.994 --> 14:25.863
spoken and unspoken,

14:25.930 --> 14:27.865
the kind of low regard
he holds for you.

14:27.932 --> 14:28.933
Let him go,

14:28.999 --> 14:31.936
unless you've become accustomed
to the pain he makes you feel,

14:32.002 --> 14:34.839
unless it's become
some kind of comfort.

14:34.905 --> 14:36.874
No, it's not a comfort.
Really?

14:36.941 --> 14:38.909
Listen, I'm nobody's punk.
You understand that?

14:38.976 --> 14:41.846
And I'm not gonna sit here

14:41.912 --> 14:43.848
and listen to
another conversation

14:43.914 --> 14:45.950
about the man who disrespects
the woman I love.

14:46.016 --> 14:47.952
Karen, it's boring.

14:48.018 --> 14:49.920
If you're really
not convinced yet

14:49.987 --> 14:52.890
that Nick George has no respect
for you, go talk to him,

14:52.957 --> 14:56.827
give him one last chance
to surprise you.

14:56.894 --> 14:58.929
But you know what?
I bet he won't.

15:03.934 --> 15:04.935
(Man) Ms. lyons.

15:05.002 --> 15:06.904
Yes, sir.
How can I help you?

15:06.971 --> 15:08.873
A little heads-up.

15:08.939 --> 15:09.907
Mm. Can't wait.

15:09.974 --> 15:12.910
I heard from one of our
air marshals out at J. F. K.

15:12.977 --> 15:14.912
Nick George went to France?

15:14.979 --> 15:16.881
Yes, I'm aware.

15:16.947 --> 15:19.917
Any idea why he's over there?
Yeah, I have
a pretty good idea.

15:19.984 --> 15:21.852
He's talking
to my star witness.

15:21.919 --> 15:25.890
It's his mother.
I can't really stop him.
You do have a plan, though?

15:25.956 --> 15:27.892
Yeah, I have a plan.
My plan is to nail

15:27.958 --> 15:29.894
Letitia Darling's ass
to the wall for murder,

15:29.960 --> 15:30.961
win this case,

15:31.028 --> 15:32.963
and after I'm done
basking in the glory

15:33.030 --> 15:35.833
of my new found celebrity,
take your job.

15:35.900 --> 15:36.967
Little heads-up.

15:42.973 --> 15:44.842
(Sighs)

15:44.909 --> 15:46.844
Look what I got.

15:46.911 --> 15:49.847
What... you can't
just show up here.

15:49.914 --> 15:51.849
If anybody saw you,
it could cost me the case

15:51.916 --> 15:52.917
and my job.

15:52.983 --> 15:54.885
Sue me. I'm incorrigible.

15:54.952 --> 15:55.953
What are these?

15:56.020 --> 15:59.857
Tickets to the weepies.
I just got 'em.
Jeremy...

15:59.924 --> 16:02.927
If you're not out of here
in the next ten seconds,

16:02.993 --> 16:05.863
I will never see you again...
Anywhere.

16:05.930 --> 16:07.898
I don't know how else
to say this,

16:07.965 --> 16:10.901
but we don't do exteriors.

16:10.968 --> 16:12.937
We can't. Okay?

16:13.003 --> 16:15.873
10... 9...
Nola--

16:15.940 --> 16:18.843
8... 7...
Okay. Won't happen again.

16:18.909 --> 16:20.845
6... 5... 4...

16:20.911 --> 16:24.014
3... 2... 1.

16:26.884 --> 16:29.887
(Knock on door)

16:29.954 --> 16:30.888
Coming.

16:30.955 --> 16:32.957
(Knock)

16:35.960 --> 16:36.927
Oh.

16:36.994 --> 16:38.896
Karen.
Hi.

16:38.963 --> 16:41.899
What are you doing here?
Looking for Nick.
Is he around?

16:41.966 --> 16:44.935
No, I'm sorry. He's not.
Will he be back
anytime soon?

16:45.002 --> 16:47.905
'Cause I can--
I can just wait.

16:47.972 --> 16:49.940
You'd be waiting a long time.
He's in France.

16:50.007 --> 16:51.942
(Gasps) Oh.
Separate vacations?
No, actually.

16:52.009 --> 16:55.913
He's visiting his mother,
who had to move 4,000 Miles away

16:55.980 --> 16:58.849
to escape
your criminally insane family.

16:58.916 --> 17:00.951
Wow. Someone's a bitch.
(Chuckles)

17:01.018 --> 17:04.855
Yeah, someone is.

17:04.922 --> 17:05.890
Okay.

17:05.955 --> 17:08.893
Will you give him
a message for me?
You know what?

17:08.959 --> 17:10.828
Since you and your family

17:10.895 --> 17:12.863
seem to see more of him lately
than I do,

17:12.930 --> 17:15.866
how about you give him
a message for me?
Do you want me to warn him

17:15.933 --> 17:17.935
that you're feeling
a little hormonal? (Laughs)

17:18.002 --> 17:19.904
Cute, but no.

17:19.970 --> 17:21.939
I want you to tell him

17:22.006 --> 17:25.843
that the next time he decides
to represent a murderer

17:25.910 --> 17:28.846
or rule
a multi-billion-dollar empire,

17:28.913 --> 17:30.881
I'd appreciate
if he'd consult with me first.

17:30.948 --> 17:33.818
Because believe it or not,
those kinds of decisions

17:33.884 --> 17:35.953
actually affect my life, too,
not to mention my marriage.

17:36.020 --> 17:38.889
Okay,
that's quite a message.

17:38.956 --> 17:41.892
And, uh, I guess just...
Tell him when you see him

17:41.959 --> 17:44.862
that back in the real world,
his wife really misses him

17:44.929 --> 17:46.864
even though she's not sure
who she's missing,

17:46.931 --> 17:48.866
because the Nick George
she used to know,

17:48.933 --> 17:50.868
the Nick
she fell in love with,

17:50.935 --> 17:53.971
doesn't seem to really,
you know, exist anymore, so...

17:56.907 --> 17:58.843
Crazy, isn't it?

17:58.909 --> 18:00.911
I always thought
I'd lose him to you.

18:00.978 --> 18:02.913
Oh.

18:02.980 --> 18:06.851
Turns out we're both
losing him to Tripp.

18:06.917 --> 18:08.853
Did you get all that?

18:08.919 --> 18:11.989
Yeah. Yeah, I got that.

18:16.927 --> 18:18.963
I'm sorry.

18:21.966 --> 18:24.001
Me, too.

18:27.905 --> 18:29.006
Uh...

18:54.932 --> 18:58.936
(Knocks on door)

19:24.962 --> 19:26.931
Oh, my God.

19:26.997 --> 19:28.866
Nicky?

19:28.933 --> 19:29.934
I knocked on the door.

19:30.000 --> 19:32.837
Why did you come here?

19:32.903 --> 19:35.840
Like I told you on the phone,
I'm defending Letitia Darling,

19:35.906 --> 19:37.908
and I need to discuss
your testimony.

19:37.975 --> 19:40.878
I don't have
anything to say.

19:40.945 --> 19:43.848
I'm sorry your father's dead.
When was the last time
you spoke to him?

19:43.914 --> 19:44.949
A lifetime ago.

19:45.015 --> 19:47.852
You sure about that?

19:47.918 --> 19:50.634
What about the Darlings--
Letitia?

19:50.700 --> 19:53.503
When is the last time you've
seen or spoken to her?

19:53.570 --> 19:55.605
I haven't been part
of their world in decades,

19:55.672 --> 19:58.508
any more than I've been
part of yours.

19:58.575 --> 20:00.510
Well, Letitia Darling's
been paying you a stipend

20:00.577 --> 20:01.611
for the last 30 years.

20:01.678 --> 20:04.614
Stipend?
Is that what she calls it?

20:04.681 --> 20:06.550
It's severance.

20:06.616 --> 20:08.618
It's $350,000 a year,
not including this house.

20:08.685 --> 20:10.620
That's nearly
$11 million in total.

20:10.687 --> 20:13.623
It sure sounds to me like
you're a part of their world.

20:13.690 --> 20:15.559
I won't explain myself.

20:15.625 --> 20:18.562
I can't, and you'll never
be satisfied with my answers.

20:18.628 --> 20:20.564
Well, I'm not leaving here
until I get some,

20:20.630 --> 20:22.632
satisfactory or not.
Bonjour!

20:22.699 --> 20:24.568
Ah! Martin.

20:24.634 --> 20:25.635
(Both make kissing sounds)

20:25.702 --> 20:28.538
Nous avons un invité ici.
Oh, bienvenue.

20:28.605 --> 20:31.508
Nick works for
the American law firm

20:31.575 --> 20:33.510
that distributes
my grandfather's trust.

20:33.577 --> 20:36.513
Oh, very important job,
yes?

20:36.580 --> 20:38.515
Please, stay. Eat with us.

20:38.582 --> 20:40.617
I promise you never have
better oyster.

20:40.684 --> 20:43.553
Actually, Nick was
just about to leave.

20:43.620 --> 20:45.622
He has a long drive
back to Paris.

20:47.591 --> 20:49.593
You know, Paris can wait.

20:49.659 --> 20:52.456
I'd love to stay.

20:58.450 --> 21:00.452
(Martin) When I was young,
I was anostréiculteur.

21:00.519 --> 21:03.388
Oyster farmer.
But now... (Laughs)
Now I am broker,

21:03.455 --> 21:06.391
with many, many boats.

21:06.458 --> 21:08.393
I, uh, probably sell soon.

21:08.460 --> 21:11.330
If we had children,
maybe not.

21:11.396 --> 21:13.432
But, uh, that was not meant
for clare and me.

21:13.498 --> 21:17.369
Uh, I could give
to my nephew,

21:17.436 --> 21:18.403
but, uh, mm, poof.

21:18.470 --> 21:20.372
He's idiot.

21:20.439 --> 21:21.373
(Laughs)

21:21.440 --> 21:23.342
(Laughs)
You have kids, Nick?

21:23.408 --> 21:26.345
Yeah. Yeah, I have--
I have a daughter.

21:26.411 --> 21:28.380
Ah, yes, well...
And how old is she?

21:28.447 --> 21:31.350
She is 10.
Ah, you have a picture?

21:31.416 --> 21:33.452
I do.
Ah.

21:33.518 --> 21:37.356
Uh, this is, uh,
that's my wife Lisa.

21:37.422 --> 21:40.359
Ah, super be.
And there she is.
There's Kiki.

21:40.425 --> 21:41.426
(Martin laughs)

21:41.493 --> 21:43.428
Clare?

21:43.495 --> 21:45.464
(Martin) And your parents?

21:47.466 --> 21:50.335
Well, my father
passed away recently.

21:50.402 --> 21:51.403
Oh, I'm very sorry.

21:51.470 --> 21:53.372
Thank you.

21:53.438 --> 21:56.341
And your mother?

21:56.408 --> 21:59.344
(Sighs)

21:59.411 --> 22:02.347
Uh, well...

22:02.414 --> 22:05.350
Well, she--she left
when I was a little kid,

22:05.417 --> 22:08.420
so I didn't really
get to know her.
Mm. So, uh,

22:08.487 --> 22:11.423
that must have been, uh,
very difficult for you, yes?

22:11.490 --> 22:14.426
No, I-I wouldn't know.
It was my life. I lived it.

22:14.493 --> 22:17.396
I'm gonna clear the dishes.

22:17.462 --> 22:20.332
No, no, please, please.
I do that. Yes.

22:20.399 --> 22:23.368
It's better for you to stay,
maybe talk business, you know?

22:23.435 --> 22:25.404
Money.

22:31.410 --> 22:34.379
(Sobs)

22:34.446 --> 22:37.349
You ready to talk now?

22:37.416 --> 22:39.384
(Sobs)

22:39.451 --> 22:43.422
(Woman) New yorkers
are gathered here tonight

22:43.488 --> 22:45.357
at the civic auditorium

22:45.424 --> 22:47.359
to witness the debate
between incumbent Danielle root

22:47.426 --> 22:49.361
and Attorney General
Patrick Darling.

22:49.428 --> 22:52.331
And now to come to character.
Attorney General Darling,

22:52.397 --> 22:55.334
your opponent has said,
and I quote,

22:55.400 --> 22:58.403
"Patrick Darling's
relationship to the truth

22:58.470 --> 23:01.406
"is like his relationship
to his famous family,

23:01.473 --> 23:03.342
"insecure,

23:03.408 --> 23:06.345
"on again, off again,

23:06.411 --> 23:09.381
probably based
purely on financial gain."

23:09.448 --> 23:13.385
Now what do you say
to the voters of New York

23:13.452 --> 23:15.387
about your character,

23:15.454 --> 23:18.357
particularly as related
to honesty?

23:18.423 --> 23:20.392
Well, Dan, I'm glad
you brought that up,

23:20.459 --> 23:23.362
because there is something
about which

23:23.428 --> 23:27.432
I'd like to finally
set the record straight.

23:27.499 --> 23:29.368
As all of you know,

23:29.434 --> 23:32.404
my family recently experienced
a great tragedy--

23:32.471 --> 23:35.340
the death of the mother
of my children,

23:35.407 --> 23:39.378
my beloved wife
of over ten years,

23:39.444 --> 23:40.412
Ellen.

23:40.479 --> 23:42.481
(Door clatters)

23:47.486 --> 23:51.390
(Crowd murmuring)

23:51.456 --> 23:53.392
(Dan) Mr. Attorney General?

23:53.458 --> 23:57.462
(Murmuring continues)

23:59.431 --> 24:00.432
(Microphone feedback whines)

24:00.499 --> 24:03.435
Excuse me. Um...

24:03.502 --> 24:05.437
I'm sorry, Dan. Um...

24:05.504 --> 24:11.443
A, uh, story got out after...

24:11.510 --> 24:13.412
Yes, sir.

24:13.478 --> 24:15.414
Uh...

24:15.480 --> 24:19.384
A story came out
after the fire that...

24:19.451 --> 24:22.354
Ellen had become
a heavy smoker.

24:22.421 --> 24:24.456
Yes.

24:26.491 --> 24:29.361
It's not true, Dan.

24:29.428 --> 24:31.363
She only smoked
when she was upset.

24:31.430 --> 24:33.332
It was not a habit.

24:33.398 --> 24:35.367
Um...

24:35.434 --> 24:38.437
I, um... just...

24:38.503 --> 24:41.373
Wanted the people to know.

24:41.440 --> 24:44.409
Well, thank you for that
helpful clarification.

24:44.476 --> 24:46.411
Moving on.

24:46.478 --> 24:48.380
(Crowd murmurs)

24:48.447 --> 24:50.349
♪♪♪

24:50.415 --> 24:52.451
Thank you
for visiting, dad.

24:52.517 --> 24:55.454
Are you kidding? If I could,
I'd be with you every day.

24:55.520 --> 24:58.457
So come live here.
Yeah, well,
when Darling enterprises

24:58.523 --> 25:00.392
moves
its corporate headquarters

25:00.459 --> 25:02.394
to the Amazon rain forest,
maybe I will.

25:02.461 --> 25:04.396
Daddy, mommy's house
is that way.

25:04.463 --> 25:06.398
Yeah, I know.
This is a shortcut.

25:06.465 --> 25:09.368
I'm your father.
Have a little faith, okay?
This isn't the way home.

25:09.434 --> 25:11.370
Oh, you're right. Hey, maybe
this nice gentleman

25:11.436 --> 25:13.372
will give us a ride home.
No, dad.

25:13.438 --> 25:15.340
Hello, senor.

25:15.407 --> 25:17.409
Will you give me and my son
a ride to his mother's house?

25:17.476 --> 25:20.412
Come on, shrimp. Get in.
I'm not getting in until
you tell me where we're going.

25:20.479 --> 25:22.347
We're going to New York.

25:22.414 --> 25:23.415
You need to be somewhere

25:23.482 --> 25:25.417
where you're
being taken care of 24/7,

25:25.484 --> 25:28.420
not just in between
street dances or vision quests

25:28.487 --> 25:30.355
or whatever the hell

25:30.422 --> 25:31.423
your mother's
doing every night.

25:31.490 --> 25:33.425
Dad, mom works at night.

25:33.492 --> 25:36.361
She works?

25:36.428 --> 25:39.364
Right over there.

25:39.431 --> 25:41.400
That's where she goes
every night?

25:41.466 --> 25:44.403
Is that why
you brought me here?
Yeah.

25:44.469 --> 25:46.438
Yeah, and what about
the checks I send?

25:46.505 --> 25:49.341
She doesn't cash them.

25:49.408 --> 25:51.310
She wants to make it
on her own.

25:51.376 --> 25:53.445
Don't tell her I told you.

25:55.414 --> 25:58.383
Your father and I met
when I was 20.

25:58.450 --> 26:01.353
I was in my sophomore year
at U. N. C., s-still a kid,

26:01.420 --> 26:04.456
and here was Dutch,
this handsome yankee lawyer

26:04.523 --> 26:09.361
in his...
Sapphire suspenders,

26:09.428 --> 26:11.430
part of this Darling dynasty.

26:11.496 --> 26:13.398
So, what, are you trying
to tell me

26:13.465 --> 26:16.179
that he took advantage of you?

26:16.245 --> 26:18.181
No, no, no.
I loved your father.

26:18.247 --> 26:20.183
I wanted to be his wife.

26:20.249 --> 26:24.153
I wanted to be
part of his world.

26:24.220 --> 26:27.090
But, um...

26:27.156 --> 26:32.128
By the time you were born,
both Dutch and I realized...

26:32.195 --> 26:35.098
I couldn't survive
in New York society.

26:35.164 --> 26:36.199
Couldn't?

26:36.265 --> 26:40.103
I didn't belong.

26:40.169 --> 26:42.105
So...

26:42.171 --> 26:45.141
Slowly I began to, uh...

26:45.208 --> 26:48.144
Disconnect...

26:48.211 --> 26:51.114
From myself...

26:51.180 --> 26:53.182
From him...

26:56.152 --> 26:58.087
From you.

26:58.154 --> 27:00.123
(Sniffles)

27:00.189 --> 27:04.160
(Chuckles)
So I decided to leave.

27:04.227 --> 27:08.197
Why didn't you
take me with you?

27:11.200 --> 27:14.137
You flourished
in my absence.

27:14.203 --> 27:16.139
Look at you.

27:16.205 --> 27:19.075
What the hell
are you talking about?

27:19.142 --> 27:22.145
The idea...
That abandoning me

27:22.211 --> 27:24.147
was somehow
a productive decision

27:24.213 --> 27:26.115
is ridiculous.

27:26.182 --> 27:28.151
I wasn't able
to take care of you.

27:28.217 --> 27:30.119
What was I supposed to do?

27:30.186 --> 27:33.156
I don't know. I don't know.
What were you supposed to do?

27:33.222 --> 27:36.059
Maybe you could've
just looked at me and seen me

27:36.125 --> 27:38.061
and thought
it was worth it to try,

27:38.127 --> 27:40.129
to make an effort
to be a mother.

27:40.196 --> 27:42.131
Now you dragged me
into this world.

27:42.198 --> 27:44.100
I didn't ask to be born.

27:44.167 --> 27:46.169
But the minute that it got hard,
you gave up,

27:46.235 --> 27:49.105
you took the Darlings' money
and you ran away.

27:49.172 --> 27:51.174
That's what happened.
I don't even know
what to say to that!

27:51.240 --> 27:54.143
Well, you could say
you're sorry.
I'm sorry!

27:54.210 --> 27:56.179
Very good. See?
It's all better now.
Oh, please, stop!

27:56.245 --> 27:59.182
I know that you spoke to my dad
the day that he died,

27:59.248 --> 28:02.185
so I want to know what was
said in that conversation,

28:02.251 --> 28:05.154
and I want to know what you're
gonna say when you testify.

28:05.221 --> 28:08.191
And you can tell me
starting now.
Quest-ce qui se passe ici?

28:08.257 --> 28:11.094
Huh? What is happening here?
Please.

28:11.160 --> 28:13.062
(Martin speaks softly)

28:13.129 --> 28:15.131
Are you all right,
my Darling?
Oh, yes.

28:15.198 --> 28:18.134
I think, uh,
maybe you should go.
We were just--

28:18.201 --> 28:22.071
please! Please! Go! Now.

28:40.827 --> 28:42.729
(Whispers) He's sleeping.

28:42.796 --> 28:44.535
Hmm. I'm envious.

28:49.473 --> 28:52.410
(Lowered voice) He showed me
where you work. What the hell?

28:52.476 --> 28:55.413
Brian.
I send you those checks
so you don't have to work.

28:55.479 --> 28:58.416
(Lowered voice) I am not
gonna live off your family.

28:58.482 --> 29:00.351
Yes, you are.

29:00.418 --> 29:02.420
Look, I don't care
how proud you are.

29:02.486 --> 29:05.423
You cannot leave our son
home alone at night, okay?

29:05.489 --> 29:07.358
You can't.

29:07.425 --> 29:10.361
Now I'm his father.
This is not about you.

29:10.428 --> 29:12.396
Just take the money.

29:17.501 --> 29:20.404
Okay.

29:21.505 --> 29:23.507
You win...

29:26.477 --> 29:28.512
This one.

29:33.451 --> 29:36.354
You know, when you first
showed up here,

29:36.420 --> 29:38.422
I was convinced
you were gonna kidnap him

29:38.489 --> 29:40.358
or something.

29:40.424 --> 29:41.425
Kidnap him? You serious?

29:41.492 --> 29:43.361
Mm-hmm.

29:43.427 --> 29:47.398
Why would I do that?
He--he's in good hands.

29:50.501 --> 29:55.373
He's gonna miss you
when you go.

29:55.439 --> 29:59.477
I'm gonna miss him
like hell.

30:01.512 --> 30:03.514
(Indistinct conversations)

30:05.449 --> 30:06.417
Patrick?

30:06.484 --> 30:08.452
Where is she?

30:08.519 --> 30:10.454
You did very well
tonight.

30:10.521 --> 30:12.456
Dad, where's Carmelita?

30:12.523 --> 30:15.393
She's okay. She's safe.
She's near.

30:15.459 --> 30:17.395
I was fortunate.

30:17.461 --> 30:19.397
A friend of a friend
in homeland security

30:19.463 --> 30:21.465
was able
to track her down and...

30:21.532 --> 30:23.467
You know, she told me

30:23.534 --> 30:26.404
that after your late wife
had her driven away,

30:26.470 --> 30:27.471
after that was done,

30:27.538 --> 30:30.441
she made the decision
to remain in hiding

30:30.508 --> 30:33.377
out of concern
for your political future,

30:33.444 --> 30:36.414
a concern that you do not seem
to have the good sense to share.

30:36.480 --> 30:38.449
So you've got her...
Somewhere,

30:38.516 --> 30:41.385
and now you're going to
keep her from me

30:41.452 --> 30:43.521
unless I play along,
is that right?
Paddy.

30:46.457 --> 30:48.359
Okay.

30:48.426 --> 30:50.394
You win.

30:50.461 --> 30:53.364
Where is she?

30:53.431 --> 30:55.366
Here.

30:55.433 --> 30:59.437
I meant it when I said
you did well.

30:59.503 --> 31:02.473
You looked presidential,
son.

31:07.511 --> 31:10.348
(Door opens and squeaks)

31:10.414 --> 31:11.482
(Door closes)

31:15.486 --> 31:17.421
Nicky!

31:19.523 --> 31:21.459
What are you doing here?

31:21.525 --> 31:23.527
I-I wanted to see you.

31:25.496 --> 31:27.431
Why?

31:29.467 --> 31:32.436
I am... so sorry.

31:32.503 --> 31:35.373
I-I know it doesn't matter
anymore,

31:35.439 --> 31:38.409
and that you'll probably
spend the rest of your life

31:38.476 --> 31:40.411
hating me--
I don't hate you.

31:40.478 --> 31:43.414
Yes, you do, and you should.
I feel sorry for you.

31:43.481 --> 31:46.417
Every day
I didn't have a mother,

31:46.484 --> 31:48.452
you didn't have a son.

31:51.522 --> 31:54.358
Letitia killed your father,
Nicky.

31:54.425 --> 31:56.427
That's what I'm gonna tell
the court.

31:56.494 --> 31:58.429
Uh...

31:58.496 --> 32:00.464
On the basis
of what evidence?

32:00.531 --> 32:03.367
She told me
she was going to.

32:03.434 --> 32:06.370
The day your father's plane
went down, I...

32:06.437 --> 32:09.373
I got a call from him,
out of the blue.

32:09.440 --> 32:11.409
He was an absolute mess.

32:11.475 --> 32:14.378
He'd just found out
that Brian was his son

32:14.445 --> 32:16.380
and Letitia
had been lying to him.

32:16.447 --> 32:19.383
He was gonna walk away
and--and leave the Darlings.

32:19.450 --> 32:20.451
And he, uh,

32:20.518 --> 32:24.388
he wanted me to know
that he was...

32:24.455 --> 32:27.358
(Voice breaks)
He was sorry for everything.

32:27.425 --> 32:29.360
(Normal voice)
And then he said,

32:29.427 --> 32:31.395
he was going to come over
and see me

32:31.462 --> 32:34.398
and he wanted to have
a fresh start.

32:34.465 --> 32:36.400
And what did you say?

32:36.467 --> 32:38.436
Well, I-I didn't know
what to say,

32:38.502 --> 32:41.439
so I told him that, you know,
I-I still cared for him,

32:41.505 --> 32:43.441
but that we couldn't
start all over again.

32:43.507 --> 32:47.345
Too much time had passed
it was lunacy.
And did that upset him?

32:47.411 --> 32:49.447
No, he was drunk. He just
hung up the phone on me.

32:49.513 --> 32:51.415
And then what?

32:51.482 --> 32:54.352
I got scared.

32:54.418 --> 32:57.421
I didn't want him suddenly
showing up here on my doorstep.

32:57.488 --> 33:01.359
So I, um...
I picked up the phone again

33:01.425 --> 33:06.397
and called the one person
I thought could stop him.

33:06.464 --> 33:08.466
Letitia.
Mm-hmm.

33:08.532 --> 33:12.436
And you told her that Dutch
wanted to leave her for you?

33:12.503 --> 33:14.372
Yes.

33:14.438 --> 33:16.440
And--and what
did Letitia say?

33:16.507 --> 33:19.477
What were her exact words,
if you can remember them?

33:19.543 --> 33:22.413
"Don't worry, clare. I will take
care of everything. Trust me."

33:22.480 --> 33:24.415
I didn't know what that meant.

33:24.482 --> 33:27.418
I mean, if I thought
for a second...
No, no.

33:27.485 --> 33:30.421
That she was going to
do something, I would've--
no, no, no, Letitia
didn't kill dad.

33:30.488 --> 33:33.357
If you tell that story
in court,

33:33.424 --> 33:36.394
she will die in jail for
a murder she didn't commit.

33:36.460 --> 33:38.429
My silence
is not for sale anymore.

33:38.496 --> 33:41.399
She didn't do it.

33:41.465 --> 33:44.368
Why aren't you proud of me?

33:44.435 --> 33:47.405
I am doing this
for our family.

33:47.471 --> 33:49.407
No. No, no, no.
No, you're not.

33:49.473 --> 33:52.410
You're doing this
for yourself.

33:52.476 --> 33:54.412
I'm telling you
she's innocent.

33:54.478 --> 33:56.447
I am telling you to trust me.
Trust me.

33:56.514 --> 34:00.418
Trust your own son who's never
asked you for a damn thing.

34:00.484 --> 34:02.420
Don't testify. Stay here.

34:02.486 --> 34:05.356
Take the money and live
your life in peace.

34:05.423 --> 34:08.359
Please.

34:08.426 --> 34:10.428
Do this for me.

34:19.437 --> 34:21.438
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
No, it's all coming together.

34:21.505 --> 34:23.440
I've got Karen so busy
chasing her own tail,

34:23.507 --> 34:25.443
she'd never suspect a thing.

34:25.509 --> 34:27.445
I'd say
all this time and effort's

34:27.511 --> 34:30.380
gonna pay off very soon.
(Computer chirps)

34:30.447 --> 34:32.416
Wait, hold on. Hold on.

34:32.483 --> 34:34.351
She's here.

34:34.418 --> 34:37.388
Look, I gotta go.

34:37.455 --> 34:39.456
(Telephone beeps)

34:40.524 --> 34:42.360
Hey.

34:42.426 --> 34:43.360
Hey.

34:43.427 --> 34:44.395
Hi.

34:44.462 --> 34:47.431
I wasn't expecting you.

34:47.498 --> 34:49.433
I know.

34:49.500 --> 34:51.402
What's going on?

34:51.469 --> 34:54.371
I did what you said.

34:54.438 --> 34:57.341
So you went to see Nick?

34:57.408 --> 34:59.377
Yes, but I saw Lisa instead.

34:59.443 --> 35:01.479
So I'm gonna
still have to wait

35:01.545 --> 35:04.415
for you to close the book
on this guy?

35:04.482 --> 35:05.449
No.

35:05.516 --> 35:08.386
When daddy named Nick
as his successor,

35:08.452 --> 35:10.388
I wasn't just upset
because I thought

35:10.454 --> 35:13.391
I deserved to be president
of Darling enterprises.
Even though you do.

35:13.457 --> 35:17.361
I do.
I was upset because...

35:17.428 --> 35:19.363
Because there is
a tiny part of me

35:19.430 --> 35:22.366
that always thought if Nick
ever did take over the company,

35:22.433 --> 35:24.402
it would be because...

35:24.468 --> 35:26.437
He'd married me.

35:26.504 --> 35:30.374
But after hearing Lisa
and what she had to say,

35:30.441 --> 35:32.410
it seems...

35:32.476 --> 35:35.346
The Nick
that I fell in love with,

35:35.413 --> 35:38.382
he's not
really there anymore.

35:38.449 --> 35:40.451
But you are.

35:40.518 --> 35:43.387
And I don't want
to lose you.

35:43.454 --> 35:47.358
Well, you'll never
have to worry about that.

35:47.425 --> 35:50.494
As long as you want me,
I'm here.

35:53.397 --> 35:56.434
And maybe when you finally do
let go of the past...

35:56.500 --> 35:58.336
Mm.

35:58.402 --> 36:00.371
All of it...
Mm.

36:00.438 --> 36:02.373
It'll give you the chance
to open yourself up

36:02.440 --> 36:04.408
to even greater possibilities.

36:04.475 --> 36:06.477
(Gasps) Like what?

36:08.412 --> 36:10.381
Like marrying me.

36:24.528 --> 36:26.397
(Tires squeal)

36:26.464 --> 36:29.467
Okay, what the hell
did you do to my witness?

36:29.533 --> 36:31.435
What witness?

36:31.502 --> 36:33.437
I just got a call
from clare George.

36:33.504 --> 36:35.439
She says she's not
gonna testify now.

36:35.506 --> 36:38.376
Well, you should
send her a subpoena.

36:38.442 --> 36:40.444
Oh, right. She's a French
citizen living abroad.

36:40.511 --> 36:42.380
You can't.
You know what?

36:42.446 --> 36:45.349
I should have you arrested
for witness tampering.

36:45.416 --> 36:48.386
You can't charge me
for talking to my mother.

36:48.452 --> 36:49.420
You done, counselor?

36:49.487 --> 36:51.455
Not even close.

36:51.522 --> 36:54.425
(Tires squeal)

36:57.428 --> 37:00.398
(Letitia) Oh! I-I keep waiting
for this to die.

37:00.464 --> 37:02.400
It never does. (Sighs)

37:02.466 --> 37:04.435
Take it away.

37:04.502 --> 37:06.337
Letitia.

37:06.404 --> 37:09.407
Oh, you know, I spend
so much time at home now,

37:09.473 --> 37:11.409
I notice these things.

37:11.475 --> 37:13.411
Have you come to yell
at me again?

37:13.477 --> 37:15.413
Because I won't brook it.

37:15.479 --> 37:18.349
No, I came to apologize.

37:18.416 --> 37:21.352
You were right about my mother,
everything you said about her.

37:21.419 --> 37:23.387
I'm sorry, Nick.

37:23.454 --> 37:25.456
I take no pleasure in that.

37:26.524 --> 37:30.394
I should go. I haven't even
been home yet.

37:30.461 --> 37:32.430
Nick.

37:36.500 --> 37:40.438
I know I'm not your mother,
but I tried to be.

37:40.504 --> 37:42.473
I never asked you to.

37:42.540 --> 37:44.408
I know.

37:44.475 --> 37:47.478
But if you could've seen
yourself at 6,

37:47.545 --> 37:50.414
this little boy
without a mother,

37:50.481 --> 37:53.351
wandering around our house...

37:53.417 --> 37:58.356
Pushing your little
briefcase on wheels around...

37:58.422 --> 38:00.491
So full of need...

38:02.460 --> 38:05.329
I loved you.

38:05.396 --> 38:08.466
And I still do, Nicky.

38:08.532 --> 38:11.402
Can't you feel that?

38:11.469 --> 38:13.504
Can't you?

38:29.520 --> 38:32.356
I can't tonight.

38:32.423 --> 38:33.424
Bad day?

38:33.491 --> 38:35.426
Let's just say
it wasn't prime.

38:35.493 --> 38:37.461
What happened?

38:37.528 --> 38:40.464
Look, I know you can't
talk to me about mom's case.

38:40.531 --> 38:44.402
Just give me the heart stuff,
big picture.

38:44.468 --> 38:47.338
Okay.

38:47.405 --> 38:50.341
The most important thing
in my life is my work.

38:50.408 --> 38:52.443
I don't have a husband.
I don't have kids.

38:52.510 --> 38:55.379
You have a secret boyfriend.

38:55.446 --> 38:57.381
Yes,
I have a secret boyfriend

38:57.448 --> 38:59.383
and my work,

38:59.450 --> 39:02.386
and when my work
doesn't go well,

39:02.453 --> 39:04.355
when I don't have that...

39:04.422 --> 39:06.457
I don't know
what I have left.

39:08.492 --> 39:11.362
That's... my life.

39:11.429 --> 39:14.432
That's the big picture.

39:14.498 --> 39:17.368
Isn't sharing fun?

39:17.435 --> 39:21.372
You want to go see
the weepies?

39:21.439 --> 39:24.375
I told you
we cannot go out.

39:24.442 --> 39:27.445
Who said anything
about going out?

39:36.520 --> 39:39.357
Nola, weepies.

39:39.423 --> 39:41.359
Weepies, nola.

39:41.425 --> 39:42.426
Hi.
Hey.

39:42.493 --> 39:43.461
Hey.

39:43.527 --> 39:45.429
They've all signed
confidentiality agreements.

39:45.496 --> 39:47.365
Mum is the word.

39:47.431 --> 39:49.367
