WEBVTT

00:22.982 --> 00:25.314
[rock music playing]

01:11.155 --> 01:11.985
[knock on door]

01:21.499 --> 01:23.330
Henry, hi.

01:26.128 --> 01:27.504
What are you doing here?

01:27.713 --> 01:29.044
l was looking for Walt.

01:29.257 --> 01:30.963
Did I miss something
while I was in prison?

01:31.175 --> 01:35.043
No. [chuckles] Shut up.
I was just, like, dropping by.

01:35.263 --> 01:36.594
With beer?

01:39.183 --> 01:42.050
Um...

01:42.270 --> 01:44.852
so, do you have any idea
where he is, or...

01:45.064 --> 01:47.601
If I did, I would be there
rather than here.

01:49.360 --> 01:50.440
[Henry]
Hmm.

01:50.653 --> 01:52.189
What?

01:52.405 --> 01:53.736
[Henry]
Walt's saddle's on the fence.

01:53.948 --> 01:55.484
He normally puts it in the barn.

01:55.700 --> 01:57.031
So?

01:57.243 --> 01:58.858
So that is odd.
Excuse me.

02:02.540 --> 02:05.077
Hey, it's me -- Vic.

02:05.293 --> 02:08.080
Um, just, uh,
seeing what you're up to and --

02:08.296 --> 02:11.584
and I was hoping that,
um, this isn't too weird,

02:11.799 --> 02:15.257
but I was wondering
if you wanted to, um --

02:15.469 --> 02:16.595
[Henr
y
Vic! ]

02:20.433 --> 02:21.593
Henry?

02:21.809 --> 02:23.640
What?

02:23.853 --> 02:26.595
This was in his saddlebag.
It is empty.

02:26.814 --> 02:28.725
So he's out of tea.

02:28.941 --> 02:31.102
This box used to hold Walt's
wife's ashes.

02:31.319 --> 02:33.526
The fact that the ashes are gone
is significant.

02:33.738 --> 02:35.524
Why?

02:35.740 --> 02:37.696
Walt once told me that he would
not scatter Martha's ashes

02:37.908 --> 02:40.115
until he found the person
who killed her.

02:40.953 --> 02:43.615
Yeah, Miller Beck,
which we've known for months.

02:45.374 --> 02:46.875
Henry.

02:50.129 --> 02:51.289
Miller Beck stabbed her,

02:51.505 --> 02:53.791
but David Ridges
hired him to do it.

02:54.008 --> 02:55.339
And Ridges worked
for somebody else.

02:55.551 --> 02:56.882
Yeah, Jacob Nighthorse.

02:57.094 --> 02:58.550
I think Walt is going after him
right now.

02:58.763 --> 03:00.549
[Vic] No, he can't be.
Nighthorse has immunity.

03:00.765 --> 03:02.505
Walt can't arrest him.

03:02.725 --> 03:04.306
He's not going to arrest him.

03:18.032 --> 03:22.150
N The whole world's sitting
on a ticking bomb J‘J‘

03:22.370 --> 03:26.534
N The whole world's sitting

03:57.571 --> 04:01.063

N The whole world's sitting

04:22.304 --> 04:23.464
Walt!

04:24.306 --> 04:25.341
What the hell are you doing?!

04:25.558 --> 04:27.219
-He|ping!
-Get off of me!

04:27.435 --> 04:28.265
No!

04:28.477 --> 04:29.728
Doesn't involve you!

04:38.821 --> 04:40.186
Give me my rifle, Henry.

04:40.406 --> 04:41.316
I cannot do that.

04:42.742 --> 04:45.449
Suit yourself.
I'll just use this one.

04:45.661 --> 04:47.947
I do not think
this is what Martha would want.

04:49.331 --> 04:50.662
We'll never know.

04:50.875 --> 04:52.365
If you fire that gun now,

04:52.585 --> 04:54.496
you will kill everything
that you have ever stood for.

04:57.465 --> 05:00.127
We have been given a second
chance, Walt, both of us.

05:00.301 --> 05:01.586
I will not let you ruin it

05:01.802 --> 05:02.962
by shooting Nighthorse
out of the sky.

05:03.179 --> 05:05.090
l was planning on waiting
for him to land.

05:05.306 --> 05:06.512
Let me have the gun!

05:06.724 --> 05:09.932
Nighthorse is gonna pay
for Martha.

05:12.605 --> 05:14.095
He will!

05:14.315 --> 05:16.101
If you go after him
the right way,

05:16.317 --> 05:17.272
through legal means.

05:17.485 --> 05:19.021
It's too late for that.

05:21.071 --> 05:22.231
If you shoot him now,

05:22.448 --> 05:24.439
I will be implicated
as an accomplice

05:24.658 --> 05:26.910
and I will be thrown
right back in jail.

05:27.119 --> 05:30.156
You promised me that I would
never go back there.

05:39.465 --> 05:41.547
We will get him, Walt.

05:41.759 --> 05:44.546
[breathing heavily]

05:44.762 --> 05:46.548
And he will pay
for what he has done.

06:15.292 --> 06:17.032
So...

06:19.046 --> 06:21.253
What are you two doing here?

06:23.801 --> 06:25.666
Customs.

06:25.886 --> 06:27.922
Anything to declare?

06:29.723 --> 06:30.929
Nope.

06:32.309 --> 06:34.470
[Henry]
Okay, then.

06:34.687 --> 06:36.678
Our work here is done.

07:01.463 --> 07:03.670
[vehicle approaches]

07:16.186 --> 07:18.268
-Hey, morning, Walt.
-Morning.

07:19.815 --> 07:22.477
So, um,
Henry was looking for you
yesterday.

07:22.693 --> 07:23.682
He --

07:23.903 --> 07:24.938
What happened to your face?

07:25.154 --> 07:26.189
Henry found me.

07:26.405 --> 07:27.565
Where?

07:27.781 --> 07:29.191
Out and about.

07:29.408 --> 07:31.273
Don't worry.
We worked it out.

07:32.202 --> 07:33.533
What's in the box?

07:33.746 --> 07:35.156
Casino research.

07:35.372 --> 07:37.749
Stuff my wife pulled together
a while back.

07:37.958 --> 07:39.619
l was hoping
you'd get the paperwork started

07:39.835 --> 07:42.998
on getting wire taps
on Nighthorse's home and office.

07:43.213 --> 07:46.421
I think the casino's got
connections to organized crime.

07:46.634 --> 07:48.340
Why?

07:48.552 --> 07:50.167
It's a casino.

08:00.981 --> 08:02.187
Okay.

08:02.399 --> 08:03.605
I don't know what Henry said,

08:03.817 --> 08:07.230
but I didn't do anything stupid,
so...

08:07.446 --> 08:09.482
Henry didn't say anything.

08:09.698 --> 08:11.484
Should he have?

08:11.700 --> 08:13.110
Oh. Uh...

08:13.327 --> 08:14.783
No.

08:14.995 --> 08:16.201
Why are you here?

08:16.413 --> 08:17.823
Well, l was worried
about Branch,

08:18.040 --> 08:19.576
but now I'm kind of worried
about you.

08:19.792 --> 08:21.748
What's up with Branch?

08:21.961 --> 08:23.417
I haven't talked to him
in a couple weeks.

08:23.629 --> 08:24.914
We kind of left things
on a bad note,

08:25.130 --> 08:26.631
but last night out of the blue,

08:26.840 --> 08:29.217
he started texting me,
like, a bunch of texts,

08:29.426 --> 08:30.632
and they're kind of crazy.

08:30.844 --> 08:32.380
Here, read them.

08:34.014 --> 08:36.346
Don't worry.
There's nothing too personal.

08:39.895 --> 08:41.556
"You deserve better than me."

08:41.772 --> 08:43.182
Well...

08:43.399 --> 08:44.764
"I can't be with you right now."

08:44.984 --> 08:46.849
Uh, "I need to be alone."

08:47.069 --> 08:48.184
"I want you to forget about me.

08:48.404 --> 08:49.860
Don't remember me
howl really am.

08:50.072 --> 08:52.905
I'm a bad person.
Remember me how I should be"?

08:53.117 --> 08:54.948
Sounds like he's been drinking.

08:55.160 --> 08:56.946
Maybe. But...

08:57.162 --> 08:58.902
I don't know.

08:59.123 --> 09:00.613
-Did you call him?
-I texted him,

09:00.833 --> 09:01.948
but he won't respond.

09:02.167 --> 09:03.498
I didn't say text him,
I said call him,

09:03.752 --> 09:06.164
as in two people
talking to each other directly.

09:07.548 --> 09:09.630
Maybe I'll just go over
and see him.

09:10.342 --> 09:11.718
Wait. Wait.

09:11.927 --> 09:13.428
The way Branch
has been acting lately,

09:13.637 --> 09:15.593
I'm not sure I want you
going over there alone.

09:16.306 --> 09:17.842
[knock on door]

09:18.058 --> 09:19.298
Hello?

09:19.518 --> 09:20.724
Branch?

09:20.936 --> 09:21.891
[Walt]
Talked to a neighbor.

09:22.104 --> 09:23.310
Said he saw Branch's truck

09:23.522 --> 09:25.808
come and go last night
around dusk.

09:26.025 --> 09:27.890
I know where he hides a key.

09:28.110 --> 09:30.192
Cady, I don't have any right
to go into his house.

09:30.404 --> 09:32.895
Okay, so stay here.

09:33.490 --> 09:35.822
And if you're gonna arrest
the concerned ex-girlfriend,

09:36.035 --> 09:37.115
go right ahead.

09:51.008 --> 09:52.964
[chuckles]
Morning, Hank.

09:53.177 --> 09:55.919
Or, uh, closer to afternoon,
actually.

09:56.138 --> 09:57.298
Must be nice.

09:57.514 --> 09:58.720
I just got back into town.

09:58.932 --> 10:01.514
We, uh,
had all the locks changed.

10:01.727 --> 10:03.058
So, here's your new key.

10:03.270 --> 10:05.010
Ah. Don't lose it.

10:05.230 --> 10:06.515
[chuckles]

10:06.732 --> 10:10.270
Now, shall we get ready to open,
hmm?

10:12.279 --> 10:14.361
Malachi, lam confused.

10:15.074 --> 10:16.985
You haven't forgotten our deal,
have you?

10:17.826 --> 10:20.488
I give you some useless
information

10:20.704 --> 10:24.413
about my friend Darius'
whereabouts a couple years back,

10:24.625 --> 10:27.367
and you sign
the deed of your bar over to me.

10:27.586 --> 10:29.201
That was if I go to jail.

10:29.421 --> 10:30.831
No, it wasn't.

10:31.048 --> 10:32.379
You're not the first Indian

10:32.591 --> 10:35.674
to, uh,
make a bad business deal.

10:38.639 --> 10:42.803
But you did put years of sweat
into this bar.

10:43.018 --> 10:44.383
You know how to run it.

10:44.603 --> 10:46.969
You'll still be the face
of the Red Pony,

10:47.231 --> 10:49.392
and I'll look after
the finances.

10:53.987 --> 10:55.363
Well, if Barlow comes in,

10:55.572 --> 10:56.436
please have him call me
immediately.

10:56.657 --> 10:57.737
It's important.

10:59.993 --> 11:01.984
Barlow hasn't come
in the office yet.

11:02.204 --> 11:03.865
His secretary doesn't know
where he is.

11:04.081 --> 11:05.412
But that could just be her, uh,

11:05.833 --> 11:08.791
standing instructions
on what to say if I call, so...

11:10.295 --> 11:12.832
-You find anything?
-No.

11:13.048 --> 11:14.333
I checked Branch's bedroom.

11:14.550 --> 11:16.586
Luggage in the closet.

11:16.802 --> 11:18.542
Toothbrush by the sink is dry.

11:18.762 --> 11:20.673
ldon't think he slept here.

11:20.889 --> 11:23.426
-Bed's been made.
-He always makes his bed.

11:26.145 --> 11:28.056
From what I remember.

11:34.862 --> 11:35.692
It's warm.

11:38.365 --> 11:39.195
Dad.

11:45.414 --> 11:47.826
"I'm sorry.
This was not supposed to happen.

11:48.041 --> 11:51.499
But when I look in the mirror,
I don't know who I am anymore.

11:51.712 --> 11:53.748
I've let everybody down
and I can't fix this.

11:53.964 --> 11:55.920
lcan't undo what I've done.

11:56.133 --> 11:58.715
Don't try to find me.
I deserve to be alone.

11:58.927 --> 12:00.758
It's the white warrior's fault.

12:00.971 --> 12:03.053
He made me do this.

12:03.265 --> 12:05.381
Forgive me."

12:05.601 --> 12:07.637
Oh, God.

12:07.853 --> 12:09.764
What do you think he's done?

12:09.980 --> 12:11.686
I'll find him.

12:11.899 --> 12:13.685
I'll get Vic and Ferg to trace
his phone.

12:13.901 --> 12:16.483
We'll find him, okay?

12:16.695 --> 12:17.650
You go home.

12:18.030 --> 12:20.237
You try and get ahold of
Branch's dad.

12:20.449 --> 12:23.612
Try the house, try the office.

12:25.204 --> 12:27.320
Maybe he'll respond to you.

12:27.539 --> 12:28.779
Dad.

12:28.999 --> 12:30.455
What are you looking for?

12:31.835 --> 12:33.291
Nothing.

12:34.463 --> 12:35.953
He's got a shotgun.

12:36.173 --> 12:37.379
Which is exactly why
you want to put one of these on.

12:37.591 --> 12:39.001
Never wore one.
Not starting.

12:39.259 --> 12:40.715
So, this is where the phone
company pinged his phone?

12:40.928 --> 12:41.963
More or less.

12:42.304 --> 12:43.840
Stop changing the subject.
Put it on.

12:44.056 --> 12:45.171
In my experience,

12:45.390 --> 12:47.767
bulletproof vests beget bullets,
so...

12:47.976 --> 12:50.433
Yeah, and in my experience,
when a cop goes postal,

12:50.646 --> 12:52.386
you want to have
one of these on.

12:52.606 --> 12:54.016
She's right, Sheriff.

12:54.775 --> 12:56.390
We're not going with you
unless you put it on.

12:56.610 --> 12:58.521
I don't have time to argue.

12:58.737 --> 13:00.238
[Vic]
Oh, Jesus.

14:12.602 --> 14:14.763
[breathing heavily]

14:35.292 --> 14:36.281
No.

15:07.491 --> 15:09.072
Branch.

15:10.285 --> 15:11.320
Branch.

15:15.248 --> 15:17.455
[breathing heavily]

15:57.290 --> 15:59.667
His, uh...

15:59.876 --> 16:03.539
truck was parked about 100 yards
or so down the bank.

16:06.466 --> 16:08.047
His deputy's uniform and his hat

16:08.260 --> 16:10.546
were in the truck
along with his phone.

16:10.762 --> 16:13.048
Box of shotgun shells
in the back.

16:14.391 --> 16:15.676
Okay.

16:20.689 --> 16:22.395
[Vic]
Should we move the body?

16:24.734 --> 16:26.270
No.

16:29.489 --> 16:31.275
Wait, I think we know
what happened here.

16:31.491 --> 16:32.901
Doesn't matter.

16:33.118 --> 16:34.858
We still got to do the work.

16:35.078 --> 16:37.194
We still got to write up
the report.

16:38.748 --> 16:41.364
Branch Connally was a deputy
in my department.

16:41.585 --> 16:44.167
He gets the same thorough
investigation

16:44.337 --> 16:45.747
that anybody else would get.

16:47.090 --> 16:48.375
I wasn't suggesting
that we don't --

16:48.592 --> 16:51.550
I want to know every detail

16:51.803 --> 16:53.919
about every minute
of his last days.

16:54.181 --> 16:56.217
Every minute
I didn't get to him.

16:57.893 --> 16:59.474
Determining time of death
is gonna be hard

16:59.686 --> 17:00.596
because of the cold water.

17:00.812 --> 17:02.097
I don't care.

17:04.065 --> 17:05.771
We're gonna try.

17:06.443 --> 17:12.188
I ignored everything,
everything leading up to this.

17:13.533 --> 17:15.910
I'm not gonna ignore
anything now.

17:19.915 --> 17:22.952
Need me to take pictures
of the body?

17:24.002 --> 17:25.503
No.

17:25.712 --> 17:27.623
Give me the camera.

17:31.593 --> 17:33.379
I'll do it.

17:39.184 --> 17:41.049
Vic, you...

17:42.145 --> 17:45.433
You got any of those
rubber gloves?

17:47.317 --> 17:49.148
What?

17:49.361 --> 17:52.398
Just never seen you use gloves
before.

17:54.950 --> 17:56.406
Well...

17:58.495 --> 18:01.111
I've never lost a deputy before.

18:06.086 --> 18:08.247
I'm gonna go back

18:08.463 --> 18:10.624
through Branch's truck
a bit more carefully,

18:10.840 --> 18:12.967
see if the shotgun shells match,

18:13.176 --> 18:14.791
check the call log
on his cellphone.

18:15.011 --> 18:18.799
After that,
head over to his house,

18:19.015 --> 18:20.175
take a look with fresh eyes.

18:20.392 --> 18:22.553
I was -- l was there earlier,
but I --

18:22.769 --> 18:24.430
Yeah. Of course.

18:30.569 --> 18:32.480
So, who's gonna tell Cady?

18:40.620 --> 18:42.451
[engine shuts off]

18:42.664 --> 18:46.498
[breathes deeply]

18:49.170 --> 18:51.912
Cady, I'm sorry.

18:53.675 --> 18:55.461
It's Branch.

19:00.890 --> 19:02.505
We found Branch.

19:04.603 --> 19:06.059
It's not good.

19:08.523 --> 19:10.479
Oh, shit.

19:22.412 --> 19:24.323
[Cady] Hey.
I thought I heard you pull up.

19:24.497 --> 19:26.829
What happened?
What's going on?

19:28.418 --> 19:29.999
Ferg, what happened?

19:32.213 --> 19:33.293
Is he okay?

19:36.176 --> 19:39.088
He -- He's...
[clears throat]

19:40.639 --> 19:42.379
He's dead, isn't he?

19:44.434 --> 19:45.640
[Ferg]
Committed...

19:45.852 --> 19:47.638
[clears throat]

19:47.854 --> 19:49.594
He killed himself.

19:54.444 --> 19:56.400
[crying] I'm so sorry, Cady.

20:12.796 --> 20:14.502
Truth is that the Branch
that we knew

20:14.714 --> 20:16.545
was gone a long time ago.

20:22.472 --> 20:24.713
I know this wasn't easy on you,
Ferg.

20:25.975 --> 20:28.102
I'm glad you were the one
to tell me.

20:29.938 --> 20:31.894
I was the last one
to see him alive.

20:34.818 --> 20:38.026
I had to go get the keys
to his squad car.

20:45.078 --> 20:47.114
[Cady]
Just doing yourjob.

20:47.330 --> 20:48.740
And he knew --

20:48.957 --> 20:51.824
he knew that you were always
a good friend.

20:52.043 --> 20:53.658
No, I wasn't.

20:56.673 --> 20:58.538
l was jealous.

21:00.510 --> 21:03.798
And I wished for bad things
to happen to him.

21:04.013 --> 21:06.390
Now it just seems so stupid.

21:11.062 --> 21:13.439
[sighs]

21:16.609 --> 21:17.940
It's okay.

21:19.028 --> 21:20.734
It's okay, Ferg.

21:22.532 --> 21:24.022
It's okay.

21:37.547 --> 21:39.083
[Walt]
196.

21:40.300 --> 21:41.585
Okay, that's it.

21:41.801 --> 21:43.837
-Out, Walt.
-What?

21:44.053 --> 21:45.259
Look, I said you could sit there

21:45.472 --> 21:46.882
as long as you kept
your mouth shut.

21:47.098 --> 21:49.180
-Sorry. I will.
-No, you won't.

21:49.392 --> 21:52.259
I-I don't blame you,
but it rattles my nerves.

21:53.146 --> 21:54.807
Well, I need to know what
happened.

21:55.023 --> 21:56.388
I told you.

21:56.608 --> 21:59.190
Birdshot to the head
at extremely close range.

21:59.402 --> 22:01.233
I found wadding from
a shotgun shell in the wound

22:01.446 --> 22:06.566
and, as you have so rigorously
pointed out, 196 pieces of shot.

22:06.785 --> 22:09.447
All consistent
with a self-inflicted gunshot.

22:09.662 --> 22:10.868
Suicide.

22:11.080 --> 22:12.365
You sure?

22:12.582 --> 22:14.288
Consistent with suicide.

22:14.501 --> 22:16.583
I mean, I have more work to do
before I can confirm anything,

22:16.795 --> 22:18.877
and all due respect, Walt,

22:19.088 --> 22:20.749
I had planned
on doing that work alone.

22:20.965 --> 22:22.375
Now, I need to run
a couple more tests

22:22.592 --> 22:24.378
before I can release the body
to the family,

22:24.594 --> 22:26.255
-so if you can --
-You can take your time, Doc.

22:26.471 --> 22:28.302
I haven't found the family yet.

22:28.515 --> 22:30.506
And I still need them to ID.
the body, so...

22:30.725 --> 22:34.593
Well, Walt, we know who it is.
I mean, I gave him that scar.

22:34.813 --> 22:37.099
Well, technically,
I guess we gave him that scar.

22:37.315 --> 22:39.226
You're not releasing him
till I find the family.

22:40.693 --> 22:42.024
Okay.

22:44.948 --> 22:47.064
[sighs]

22:49.035 --> 22:51.447
[mid-tempo music playing]

22:54.290 --> 22:56.155
[Henry]
You do know we serve food here.

22:56.376 --> 22:58.162
[Walt]
I'm not hungry.

23:02.966 --> 23:05.002
How are you doing?

23:05.218 --> 23:09.507
Well, checked three shells,

23:09.722 --> 23:12.054
all from the box
of number 4 game loads

23:12.267 --> 23:14.849
that Branch had in his truck.

23:15.061 --> 23:17.723
All came out
to the exact same pellet count.

23:17.939 --> 23:19.520
Not one anomaly.

23:19.732 --> 23:21.472
I meant how are you doing?

23:21.693 --> 23:24.150
Better than Branch.

23:29.033 --> 23:32.070
Wait, I know what it feels like
to have a death weigh on you.

23:33.663 --> 23:35.824
I think about Hector every day.

23:36.040 --> 23:37.155
I wonder if there is anything
I can --

23:37.375 --> 23:38.956
Six pellets are missing.

23:39.711 --> 23:41.497
All these shells have 202.

23:41.713 --> 23:45.205
Branch's head wound
only had 196, so...

23:46.092 --> 23:47.593
Six pellets are missing.

23:47.802 --> 23:49.167
Probably washed away
in the river.

23:49.387 --> 23:51.127
And this proves what?

23:53.683 --> 23:55.264
Are you trying
to turn this suicide

23:55.476 --> 23:57.307
into a murder
to ease your conscience?

23:58.354 --> 23:59.890
Or is this so you have
another reason

24:00.106 --> 24:02.392
to go after Nighthorse
as the most likely suspect?

25:09.300 --> 25:11.382
[Ruby]
Walt, Igot Vic for you.

25:15.098 --> 25:16.508
Go ahead.

25:16.724 --> 25:18.464
[Vic]
So, I'm at Branch '5 house.

25:18.685 --> 25:20.425
And I found some business cards.

25:20.645 --> 25:22.601
Branch started working
for his dad.

25:22.814 --> 25:24.020
[Walt]
Doing what?

25:24.232 --> 25:26.564
Vice Presidenting.

25:26.776 --> 25:30.143
You find out, uh,
anything about the, urn...

25:30.363 --> 25:33.480
Well, you saw the note
on the computer.

25:33.700 --> 25:35.156
But I also found
a bunch of pills in a drawer

25:35.368 --> 25:37.233
that I recognize
from a case a few months back.

25:37.453 --> 25:39.034
He stole them from evidence?

25:39.247 --> 25:40.953
Yeah, looks like it.

25:41.165 --> 25:43.121
So, he was self-medicating.

25:43.334 --> 25:46.826
Left a self-loathing note.
We've both seen this before.

25:47.046 --> 25:48.206
I know we don't want
to admit it,

25:48.423 --> 25:49.959
but it looks like suicide.

25:50.174 --> 25:52.790
Walt, listen, I-l know

25:53.011 --> 25:54.467
that you're gonna try and take
responsibility for this,

25:54.679 --> 25:56.260
but you didn't even fire him.

25:56.514 --> 25:58.630
After everything that he did,
you only suspended him.

25:58.850 --> 26:00.636
I'm the one that he was mad at.

26:00.852 --> 26:04.595
I'm the one that he had
an entire file of research on.

26:05.815 --> 26:08.022
If he blamed anyone,
it was me, okay?

26:08.818 --> 26:09.773
So, what do you think
that he meant

26:10.069 --> 26:11.650
by "I can't fix this "?

26:11.946 --> 26:13.561
Do you think he was talking
about us and the job,

26:13.781 --> 26:15.612
or do you think
he did something else?

26:15.825 --> 26:17.611
[Walt]
Vic, [got to go.

26:40.933 --> 26:42.139
[Barlow] Mother Superior says,

26:42.351 --> 26:45.013
"Well, Monsignor,
it's usually $150,

26:45.229 --> 26:47.811
but with the clerical discount,
it'll be $75."

26:48.024 --> 26:50.106
[laughter]

26:50.318 --> 26:53.731
Now, there's a PG-13 version of
that story for the family,

26:53.946 --> 26:55.652
but it's not half as funny.

26:55.865 --> 26:57.605
[laughter]

26:58.367 --> 26:59.868
Oh.

27:00.078 --> 27:01.989
Gentlemen, if this is your idea
of a stripper,

27:02.205 --> 27:04.036
I'm gonna have to kick
all your asses.

27:04.248 --> 27:06.204
-[|aughter]
-It wasn't me.

27:07.752 --> 27:09.333
Barlow, I need a word.

27:09.545 --> 27:11.001
This is a private dinner.

27:11.214 --> 27:12.579
If you need to talk to me,
you call my office,

27:12.799 --> 27:14.380
and we'll get you put
on my calendar.

27:14.592 --> 27:16.048
[Wait]
I tried that.

27:16.260 --> 27:18.125
And my secretary
told you I was here?

27:18.304 --> 27:20.386
-l'm gonna have to fire her.
-[|aughter]

27:20.598 --> 27:22.213
You told me you were here.

27:22.433 --> 27:24.515
I t-- Oh.

27:24.727 --> 27:27.184
I am way too buzzed
to play Sherlock Holmes.

27:27.396 --> 27:30.559
Whatever it is you came to say,
you just go ahead and say it.

27:30.775 --> 27:32.106
Really, Barlow, please.

27:32.318 --> 27:33.979
This -- This needs
to be in private.

27:34.195 --> 27:35.935
Sheriff,
anything you got to say to me

27:36.155 --> 27:38.487
you can say in front
of my partners-to-be.

27:39.325 --> 27:40.360
It's Branch.

27:40.576 --> 27:41.440
Yeah, I know.
He's late.

27:41.661 --> 27:43.151
It's not the first time.

27:43.371 --> 27:45.327
He's not coming.

27:45.540 --> 27:47.451
Why in the hell not?

27:48.751 --> 27:50.662
Gentlemen, please.

28:09.981 --> 28:11.562
He's dead.

28:12.441 --> 28:14.853
Branch is dead.

28:15.069 --> 28:17.185
He's been shot.

28:20.366 --> 28:21.776
Ifound him.

28:21.993 --> 28:22.948
He had his phone on him.

28:23.161 --> 28:24.617
Thafs".

28:24.829 --> 28:26.535
how I knew to come here.

28:30.418 --> 28:31.624
But he...

28:37.008 --> 28:38.873
Who?

28:42.346 --> 28:43.927
Who shot him?

28:44.140 --> 28:50.181
Well, it looks, um...
self-inflicted.

28:51.772 --> 28:53.387
No.

28:54.734 --> 28:56.975
No. No, no, no, no.

28:57.195 --> 28:58.355
Unh-unh.

28:58.571 --> 28:59.651
No.

29:01.866 --> 29:03.106
No!

29:14.921 --> 29:16.582
He's my son.

29:20.760 --> 29:22.796
He's my son.

29:25.973 --> 29:27.929
My only son.

29:56.420 --> 29:57.409
[gasps]

29:57.630 --> 29:59.245
[thud, tires screech]

30:01.384 --> 30:02.544
Shit.

30:04.011 --> 30:05.592
[dinging]

30:25.241 --> 30:26.526
Shit.

30:42.675 --> 30:44.666
[sobbing]

31:35.353 --> 31:37.719
[boy] Dear Hector,
if you are not dead,

31:37.938 --> 31:39.394
will you please help me?

31:39.607 --> 31:41.768
Sometimes my uncle
drinks too much,

31:41.984 --> 31:44.521
and then he gets really angry
and he hits my mom.

31:44.737 --> 31:46.728
I'm not big enough
to make him stop,

31:46.947 --> 31:48.448
but you are.

31:48.824 --> 31:51.110
[woman] Hector, every day my son
comes home from school

31:51.327 --> 31:52.567
beaten to a pulp.

31:52.912 --> 31:54.777
I tell him to fight back,
but he refuses.

31:54.997 --> 31:57.704
Please help my son
find the fighter within.

31:57.917 --> 32:00.124
[man] Hector, all the money
I've been saving is gone.

32:00.336 --> 32:02.167
I've been working every day
since I was 13 trying to save.

32:02.380 --> 32:04.086
[woman] ljust had
a beautiful baby girl.

32:04.298 --> 32:05.799
When my boyfriend saw her,
he knew she wasn't his.

32:06.008 --> 32:07.999
[man] Please,
justice for my wife,

32:08.219 --> 32:09.755
who was mugged getting off
her shift at the hospital.

32:09.970 --> 32:11.176
[boy] Hector, you're the only
one who knows

32:11.430 --> 32:12.545
how scared I am
to go to school.

32:13.391 --> 32:14.801
[woman] He can hit me all
he wants, but if he touches...

32:15.017 --> 32:15.847
[woman] My son is missing,
and I know

32:16.143 --> 32:17.349
it's my ex-husband who has him.

32:17.561 --> 32:18.346
-Hector.
-Hector.

32:18.562 --> 32:19.392
-Hector.
-Hector.

32:19.647 --> 32:21.683
-Hector.
-Hector.

32:39.917 --> 32:41.498
[sniffles]

32:58.811 --> 33:00.142
[grunts]

33:02.398 --> 33:03.604
[sighs]

33:14.910 --> 33:16.286
[clank]

33:38.476 --> 33:40.717
[Walt] You're messing up
my crime scene.

33:41.520 --> 33:43.351
River already did that.

33:45.774 --> 33:47.150
You okay?

33:49.445 --> 33:51.151
I did it again.

33:51.989 --> 33:53.854
What?

33:56.785 --> 33:59.777
Another man is dead
because of me.

34:00.915 --> 34:02.621
I'm toxic.

34:02.833 --> 34:08.669
You should just stay away from
me 'cause I'm bad for people.

34:09.882 --> 34:12.624
And really bad for possums.

34:13.302 --> 34:15.088
Or is it opossum?

34:15.304 --> 34:17.295
Possum, opossum.

34:17.515 --> 34:19.676
I don't even know.

34:19.892 --> 34:21.883
Doesn't matter.
He's dead.

34:22.978 --> 34:25.185
-Vic, that's --
-Did you know

34:25.397 --> 34:28.981
that I came to Wyoming
to start over?

34:29.193 --> 34:30.433
Like, l-l left Philly

34:30.653 --> 34:32.894
to get away
from all of that shit.

34:33.113 --> 34:36.526
But you can't --
can't start over.

34:36.742 --> 34:38.198
There are no second chances.

34:38.410 --> 34:42.323
Your shit just follows you
everywhere you go,

34:42.540 --> 34:44.201
and you just keep making
the same

34:44.416 --> 34:47.283
goddamn mistakes
over and over again.

34:47.503 --> 34:49.414
Maybe --

34:49.630 --> 34:53.623
Maybe the point
is to keep trying.

34:54.343 --> 34:57.927
Maybe getting it right
just one time is good enough.

34:58.138 --> 34:59.514
Come on.
Let's get you out of here.

34:59.765 --> 35:02.723
Oh. [chuckles]

35:02.935 --> 35:08.646
Did you know that my dad
used to call me "The Terror"?

35:08.857 --> 35:10.017
He's right.

35:10.234 --> 35:11.474
You know, I'm -- I am the terror

35:11.694 --> 35:13.184
because everyone
who gets too close to me

35:13.404 --> 35:15.269
either dies or they leave.

35:15.489 --> 35:17.275
So, you know --
Don't you touch me!

35:17.491 --> 35:19.277
Uh! [screams]

35:19.493 --> 35:21.575
[breathing heavily]

35:22.580 --> 35:23.535
No.

35:23.747 --> 35:27.285
-Come on.
-No. No.

35:28.002 --> 35:29.708
Fine.

35:29.920 --> 35:32.161
Gonna be fine.

35:41.348 --> 35:43.384
Did my dad send you?

35:43.601 --> 35:44.716
lsent me.

35:45.769 --> 35:47.760
I made you waffles.

35:47.980 --> 35:50.221
Food eases sorrow.

35:50.983 --> 35:52.769
Have you even spoken
to your dad?

35:52.985 --> 35:54.350
No.

35:55.487 --> 35:56.613
Have you?

35:56.822 --> 35:58.323
Yes.

35:58.532 --> 36:01.148
Or should I say I talked at him.

36:01.368 --> 36:03.745
[silverware clatters]

36:03.954 --> 36:09.119
Branch's death
has him immersed in his work.

36:09.710 --> 36:13.328
It's okay. I... need time
to be with my own thoughts.

36:13.547 --> 36:16.254
l have been thinking
about Branch, too.

36:17.676 --> 36:19.587
How much he helped me.

36:21.013 --> 36:23.675
I would like to return
his bail money.

36:23.891 --> 36:26.633
Henry, you don't have
that kind of money.

36:26.852 --> 36:28.808
And besides, I don't think
it matters much to him now.

36:29.021 --> 36:32.013
My freedom cost a lot of people.

36:32.650 --> 36:34.982
I would at least like to return

36:35.194 --> 36:38.061
the legal defense money
that was donated.

36:38.280 --> 36:40.612
Do you have records of
who contributed and how much?

36:40.824 --> 36:42.030
Not really.

36:42.201 --> 36:44.487
It was kind of
a pass-the-hat thing.

36:46.288 --> 36:47.824
But I have copies
of all the affidavits

36:48.040 --> 36:49.371
that people wrote for you.

36:49.583 --> 36:51.414
That should be close
to a complete list

36:53.170 --> 36:55.161
I have those files.
I'll get them.

36:55.381 --> 36:57.337
No.

36:57.549 --> 36:58.834
They can wait.

37:00.594 --> 37:02.095
Eat.

37:19.697 --> 37:21.562
You know the hardest part?

37:25.452 --> 37:27.317
Realizing how little I feel

37:27.538 --> 37:30.450
about someone
who once meant so much to me.

37:37.506 --> 37:39.167
[sighs]

37:43.053 --> 37:44.463
[groans]

38:04.408 --> 38:06.490
If you're looking
for your possum,

38:06.702 --> 38:09.159
I buried him
by that tree over there.

38:11.206 --> 38:13.117
Isn't the water cold?

38:14.084 --> 38:15.369
Yep.

38:16.920 --> 38:19.127
What are you doing?

38:19.840 --> 38:22.377
Looking for the missing birdshot

38:22.593 --> 38:25.505
from the shotgun shell
that killed Branch.

38:25.721 --> 38:29.464
Planning on dredging
the entire river or just...

38:32.144 --> 38:34.635
Hey, Walt,
what's this gonna prove?

38:34.855 --> 38:36.345
Don't know yet.

38:37.900 --> 38:40.892
Yeah, I think you do.

38:41.111 --> 38:43.568
If you find the pellets, it just
proves what we already know.

38:43.781 --> 38:45.237
If you don't find them,
it just means

38:45.449 --> 38:46.905
that they're buried by mud

38:47.117 --> 38:48.982
or they were carried away
by the stream or --

38:49.203 --> 38:50.693
If it was me instead of him,

38:50.913 --> 38:52.995
I'd hope you'd do
the same thing.

38:56.418 --> 38:58.534
Do you know who you sound like?

38:59.421 --> 39:00.581
Look at you.

39:01.965 --> 39:03.466
You've been up all night,
and -- and --

39:03.675 --> 39:05.085
and you're planning on panning

39:05.302 --> 39:08.419
an entire river
for a couple of 333.

39:08.639 --> 39:11.506
It's like Branch's obsessive
behavior was contagious.

39:11.725 --> 39:13.556
I missed something, Vic.

39:13.769 --> 39:16.010
I didn't pay close enough
attention.

39:16.939 --> 39:19.225
I didn't see how bad
things had gotten for Branch.

39:19.441 --> 39:21.682
You have got to stop
blaming yourself for this.

39:21.902 --> 39:23.893
Too late.

39:24.112 --> 39:27.024
I'm not gonna miss
anything more.

39:27.241 --> 39:29.277
If I find the rest
of the birdshot,

39:29.493 --> 39:30.949
maybe this'll all make

39:31.161 --> 39:33.402
more sense to me
than it does right now.

39:33.622 --> 39:35.533
And if I don't,

39:35.707 --> 39:38.119
at least I'll know it wasn't
through lack of trying.

39:40.045 --> 39:42.252
I think I'm gonna be sick.

39:42.464 --> 39:44.750
Well, try to get clear
of the crime scene.

39:47.177 --> 39:48.758
Jesus.

39:52.224 --> 39:55.682
Hey, Ruby said she didn't know
where either of you guys were,

39:55.894 --> 39:57.475
so I thought you'd be down...

39:58.480 --> 39:59.936
What's he doing?

40:01.608 --> 40:03.394
Grasping at anything
that will prevent him

40:03.610 --> 40:06.352
from having to face the fact
that Branch committed suicide.

40:06.572 --> 40:07.436
[gunshot]

40:07.656 --> 40:09.271
Shit!
Jesus.

40:09.491 --> 40:13.029
Guns make a lot of noise,
especially shotguns.

40:13.245 --> 40:15.236
Anybody could hear my gun

40:15.455 --> 40:17.741
sure as hell
could hear Branch's.

40:17.958 --> 40:19.914
Ferg, get out there.

40:20.127 --> 40:21.742
See if you can find anyone

40:21.962 --> 40:24.044
within earshot
the last couple of days.

40:24.256 --> 40:26.918
I'm supposed to just ask anyone
that lives within a mile of --

40:27.134 --> 40:28.340
[gunshot]

40:28.552 --> 40:31.214
Ferg, why are you still here?

40:41.690 --> 40:44.306
Nothing to see here.

40:44.526 --> 40:46.608
Just, you know...

40:46.820 --> 40:48.026
move along.

40:52.910 --> 40:54.525
[organ music playing]

41:02.044 --> 41:03.580
Um, Ruby.

41:03.795 --> 41:05.877
Are you sure he knows
it's today?

41:06.089 --> 41:07.829
I reminded him three times.

41:08.050 --> 41:09.836
He should be here.

41:11.845 --> 41:12.960
[door closes]

42:13.323 --> 42:17.032
[Barlow]
Branch Connally, my son...

42:18.453 --> 42:21.195
did not take his own life.

42:22.207 --> 42:24.994
He was a deputy

42:25.210 --> 42:27.872
of the Absaroka County
Sheriff's Department.

42:31.008 --> 42:33.499
And that job took his life.

42:45.814 --> 42:47.975
Trying to help all of you.

42:49.484 --> 42:51.224
Help the sheriff.

42:52.738 --> 42:58.574
He sacrificed himself,
even when it went unappreciated.

43:01.580 --> 43:04.822
He would've been sheriff himself
one day if only...

43:13.550 --> 43:15.290
The,uh".

43:16.136 --> 43:20.300
The Connally family
settled this county.

43:22.184 --> 43:27.224
And a lot of Connallys
laid down their lives for it.

43:33.528 --> 43:36.736
But not before they left
their mark.

43:39.409 --> 43:43.994
Branch was supposed to have
built on what I had done,

43:44.206 --> 43:47.118
j-just like I did from my daddy.

43:49.127 --> 43:51.334
But now, uh...

43:53.882 --> 43:55.497
it's the end of the line.

43:57.302 --> 43:59.668
We, uh...

44:01.223 --> 44:03.430
We all let him down.

44:03.642 --> 44:06.179
But that's, uh --

44:06.394 --> 44:09.386
that's the past now.

44:10.315 --> 44:12.431
So, let's, uh...

44:14.694 --> 44:19.905
Let's try to carry him
in our hearts going forward.

44:21.827 --> 44:23.317
He...

44:56.111 --> 44:58.568
Did you notice who wasn't here?

44:58.780 --> 45:00.236
Lucian?

45:00.448 --> 45:02.109
[Walt]
Lucian doesn't do funerals, no.

45:02.325 --> 45:04.065
Nighthorse.

45:04.286 --> 45:05.571
Ah.

45:06.955 --> 45:09.742
I'm not obsessing, Henry.
I'm observing.

45:10.709 --> 45:13.576
Nighthorse was Branch's biggest
benefactor during the election.

45:13.795 --> 45:15.706
You'd think he would make
an appearance.

45:15.922 --> 45:17.537
Walt, do you think
it might be a good idea

45:17.716 --> 45:19.752
to take a break from
your crusade just for today?

45:19.968 --> 45:21.083
Ferg.

45:22.053 --> 45:23.554
When you brought Branch

45:23.763 --> 45:25.378
the personal items
from his desk,

45:25.599 --> 45:28.136
do you remember seeing a bag
full of surveillance cameras?

45:28.351 --> 45:30.216
Yeah, they were right on top.
Why?

45:30.437 --> 45:32.928
'Cause I don't remember
seeing them in Branch's house.

45:33.148 --> 45:35.560
-Did you?
-Did I what?

45:35.775 --> 45:38.187
See a bag full of surveillance
cameras at Branch's house?

45:38.403 --> 45:40.519
No, why?

45:40.739 --> 45:43.355
So, what do you think
that means, Sheriff?

45:43.575 --> 45:44.655
I don't know.

45:45.160 --> 45:47.242
Maybe he put them
somewhere we haven't looked yet.

45:47.454 --> 45:51.447
Or maybe there was incriminating
evidence on those cameras.

45:51.666 --> 45:55.033
And Jacob Nighthorse
broke in and stole it.

46:08.516 --> 46:09.926
Cady.

46:10.143 --> 46:11.474
Cady.

46:13.021 --> 46:14.306
How you holding up?

46:14.522 --> 46:16.558
Oh, you know.
[chuckles]

46:16.775 --> 46:17.981
Yeah.

46:18.193 --> 46:20.650
You want to get some breakfast?

46:20.862 --> 46:21.977
Uh, l-l can't.

46:22.197 --> 46:23.528
Branch's family invited me

46:23.740 --> 46:26.197
to a private ceremony
at the grave site, so...

46:26.409 --> 46:28.365
Of course.
Makes sense.

46:28.578 --> 46:29.784
Not really,
but I guess they don't know

46:29.996 --> 46:32.282
that Branch and I broke up.

46:32.499 --> 46:33.659
It's awkward because

46:33.875 --> 46:35.991
I've never met
Branch's mom before.

46:36.211 --> 46:37.496
That's good of you to go, so...

46:37.712 --> 46:39.293
Yeah.

46:39.464 --> 46:40.670
Um...

46:40.882 --> 46:42.167
How are you?

46:42.884 --> 46:43.748
I'm fine.

46:43.969 --> 46:45.209
ReaHy?

46:45.428 --> 46:46.838
That's not what I'm hearing.

46:47.055 --> 46:49.671
What are you hearing?

46:50.725 --> 46:55.810
That you're having a hard time
accepting the reality of this.

46:56.940 --> 46:58.180
You talking to Henry?

46:58.400 --> 47:01.062
Doesn't matter
who I'm talking to, Dad.

47:01.695 --> 47:04.653
You got to stop carrying around
all this guilt.

47:04.864 --> 47:06.274
You couldn't have done anything.

47:06.491 --> 47:07.776
Branch changed.

47:07.993 --> 47:10.826
I didn't even recognize him
at the end.

47:11.037 --> 47:15.371
What he did, it was --
it was really sad.

47:17.085 --> 47:21.169
But it happened,
and it wasn't your fault.

47:29.806 --> 47:31.546
You know what?
Let's go to breakfast.

47:31.808 --> 47:32.843
-Let's go.
-No, no. You can't.

47:33.059 --> 47:34.219
I-l don't think

47:34.436 --> 47:35.596
that you should be alone
right now.

47:35.812 --> 47:37.427
Neither should Branch's parents.

47:37.647 --> 47:39.979
They just lost their only son.

47:40.191 --> 47:43.558
Now, sometimes we got to do
things we don't want to, Punk.

47:46.197 --> 47:48.688
But what do I say to them?

47:48.908 --> 47:50.819
You don't have to say a word.

47:55.206 --> 47:56.742
Okay.

48:07.761 --> 48:08.671
Thanks.

48:35.372 --> 48:38.910
-Hey. Are you following me?
-Not anymore.

48:39.125 --> 48:40.581
Let me put this another way.

48:40.794 --> 48:42.659
Why are you following me?

48:42.879 --> 48:44.335
You know why.

48:44.547 --> 48:46.253
Okay, I give you my word.

48:46.466 --> 48:48.172
I will have no contact
whatsoever

48:48.385 --> 48:49.500
with Jacob Nighthorse today.

48:49.719 --> 48:51.505
There.
You satisfied?

48:52.931 --> 48:54.796
For today, at least.

49:12.242 --> 49:13.027
Good morning.

49:13.243 --> 49:14.699
Standing Bear.

49:14.911 --> 49:16.026
Hey.

49:16.246 --> 49:18.487
I heard you was out.

49:18.706 --> 49:21.914
It's good to see you breathing
the air of your ancestors.

49:22.127 --> 49:23.537
You have no idea.

49:23.753 --> 49:25.789
I do, actually.

49:26.005 --> 49:29.543
I did a nickel in Rawlins
back in the '905.

49:29.759 --> 49:32.375
Want to buy some oranges?

49:32.595 --> 49:34.506
I also got some buffalo jerky.

49:34.722 --> 49:38.306
Or maybe some dream catchers.

49:38.518 --> 49:39.928
The touristos love them.

49:40.145 --> 49:42.887
No, no, thank you.
I am good.

49:43.106 --> 49:45.188
I actually stopped
to pay you back.

49:45.400 --> 49:46.810
For what?

49:48.278 --> 49:50.314
You contributed
to my defense fund.

49:51.406 --> 49:53.738
You ain't got to pay me back
for that.

49:53.950 --> 49:56.066
I donated that money.

49:56.286 --> 49:58.402
Never meant to see it again.

49:58.621 --> 50:00.407
Or you, for that matter.

50:00.623 --> 50:03.410
Well, here I am.

50:03.626 --> 50:04.581
And here is your money.

50:04.794 --> 50:06.375
I ain't touching it.

50:06.588 --> 50:07.828
Ain't often an Indian

50:08.006 --> 50:10.418
goes into the white man's
justice system

50:10.633 --> 50:12.043
and comes out again.

50:12.260 --> 50:15.002
Ain't often an Indian
gets any kind ofjustice,

50:15.221 --> 50:17.963
especially
now that Hector's gone.

50:28.735 --> 50:31.818
You know, people still put notes
into Hector's jar.

50:32.989 --> 50:35.025
Out there at the old wall.

50:35.241 --> 50:37.277
It makes them feel comfort.

50:37.494 --> 50:39.280
It's good.

50:39.496 --> 50:43.080
But it's a shame ain't no one
to answer those notes no more.

50:48.630 --> 50:50.791
How about an orange
for the road?

50:52.467 --> 50:54.332
Keep the change.

50:54.552 --> 50:56.292
Hey.

51:01.809 --> 51:03.970
[engine turns over]

51:07.023 --> 51:08.638
[Ruby] As soon as I get
the messages checked,

51:08.858 --> 51:10.644
I'll put on a pot of coffee.

51:10.860 --> 51:12.236
[door closes]

51:20.453 --> 51:21.659
[clicking]

51:35.552 --> 51:37.167
Aah!
What the hell are you doing?!

51:37.428 --> 51:38.713
I wasn't, Vic!

51:38.930 --> 51:39.919
-I am not gonna lose you, too!
-I wasn't!

51:40.139 --> 51:41.424
The gun's not even loaded.

51:41.641 --> 51:43.006
-What?
-See?

51:43.226 --> 51:44.341
Empty.

51:46.104 --> 51:48.345
I couldn't stop...

51:48.565 --> 51:52.433
thinking about the length
of the barrel of this shotgun.

51:53.778 --> 51:55.279
Whether it was even possible

51:55.488 --> 51:58.651
for Branch to pull the trigger
with his hands.

52:00.618 --> 52:02.404
It would be difficult.

52:02.620 --> 52:04.201
But it would be possible.

52:09.752 --> 52:13.665
Even if he couldn't,
he could use his toe.

52:16.217 --> 52:18.754
Okay, then, so it was suicide.

52:18.970 --> 52:21.677
Will you move on now?

52:21.889 --> 52:23.425
Please.

52:25.560 --> 52:28.973
Branch was obsessed
with his case.

52:30.440 --> 52:34.353
We thought he was wrong,
but he was right.

52:34.569 --> 52:38.357
I owed it to Branch
to keep on digging, but, uh...

52:39.907 --> 52:44.241
I think I have to stop
fighting this and just, uh...

52:45.580 --> 52:48.697
just admit that what happened
happened,sou.

52:48.916 --> 52:52.579
Okay. So, then, you're not
gonna need this, right?

52:53.421 --> 52:54.877
Shit.
God damn it.

52:55.089 --> 52:56.420
-No, wait, I'll just --
-I got it.

52:56.633 --> 52:58.169
It's fine.

53:09.437 --> 53:10.643
What?

53:10.855 --> 53:12.595
[Walt]
How could dirt get in the shell?

53:12.857 --> 53:14.097
Never left the gun.

53:14.317 --> 53:16.353
There's dirt
inside the shell casing?

53:16.527 --> 53:17.357
Uh-huh.

53:25.912 --> 53:27.197
That would mean that somebody

53:27.413 --> 53:29.665
put a spent shell
back in the gun.

53:29.874 --> 53:31.080
Someone tampered
with that shotgun

53:31.292 --> 53:33.578
before we got to the scene.

53:33.795 --> 53:36.207
So, I went all over
Branch's house and the garage.

53:36.422 --> 53:39.255
No sign of the cameras
or the bag they were in.

53:41.052 --> 53:44.169
I'm sorry.
Am... I interrupting something?

53:46.057 --> 53:48.264
Branch didn't die
the way we thought he did.

53:49.977 --> 53:51.968
What we found down by the river
was staged.

53:52.188 --> 53:55.146
And whoever did it made sure
all the evidence washed away.

53:55.358 --> 53:57.269
I already know someone
with a history

53:57.527 --> 53:59.233
of staging fake death scenes.

54:00.405 --> 54:01.520
Nighthorse?

54:02.281 --> 54:03.532
Nighthorse.

54:05.952 --> 54:08.864
Doc, I need you to change
the cause of death

54:09.080 --> 54:10.445
on Branch's death certificate.

54:10.665 --> 54:12.872
-I can't.
-Well, you have to.

54:13.084 --> 54:14.574
It wasn't suicide.
It was murder.

54:14.794 --> 54:15.829
I found new evidence.

54:16.045 --> 54:17.501
It's too late, Walt.

54:17.714 --> 54:18.703
Don't you even want to hear it?

54:18.923 --> 54:20.629
Honestly, I don't really like

54:20.842 --> 54:22.833
discussing tragedy
after work hours, so, no.

54:23.052 --> 54:25.509
Come on, Doc.
You saw Branch's wound.

54:25.722 --> 54:27.462
You think after he shot himself
in the face,

54:27.682 --> 54:29.422
he ejected the shell,
picked it up off the ground,

54:29.642 --> 54:31.007
and put it back in the gun?

54:31.227 --> 54:33.263
'Cause there was dirt
in the spent shell.

54:33.479 --> 54:35.686
That's the only way
this could be a suicide.

54:35.898 --> 54:37.604
Okay, even so, Walt,
paperwork's already been filed.

54:37.817 --> 54:39.273
There's nothing I can do.

54:39.610 --> 54:41.896
So, you're gonna hide behind
some stupid bureaucratic process

54:42.113 --> 54:43.228
'cause you don't want to do
your job?

54:43.448 --> 54:44.938
Wait a minute.
Are you kidding me?

54:45.158 --> 54:46.864
My job description
says nothing about being

54:47.076 --> 54:50.159
your unofficial
unpaid forensic researcher.

54:50.371 --> 54:52.157
Officially, that body
was supposed to go to Laramie.

54:52.373 --> 54:55.490
I did the autopsy as a personal
favor out of friendship.

54:55.710 --> 54:57.541
Now you're gonna walk in here
and you're gonna criticize me

54:57.754 --> 54:59.335
for -- for not breaking the law?

54:59.547 --> 55:01.287
I'm sorry. I'm not asking you
to break the law.

55:01.507 --> 55:03.293
Actually, that's exactly what
you're asking me to do, Walt.

55:03.509 --> 55:06.046
I cannot legally alter
that death certificate

55:06.262 --> 55:07.968
unless I'm ordered
to do so by a court.

55:08.181 --> 55:09.796
So, if you want a change,

55:09.974 --> 55:11.760
you're gonna have to present
evidence in a court of law,

55:11.976 --> 55:15.013
and if you want to prove that
Branch didn't commit suicide,

55:15.229 --> 55:16.435
I'm telling you right now,
you're gonna need

55:16.647 --> 55:18.148
a little bit more
than just some dirt.

55:18.357 --> 55:19.858
Hey, listen.

55:20.067 --> 55:21.773
You two rummies
don't keep it down out here,

55:21.986 --> 55:23.897
I'm gonna have to ask you
to leave.

55:24.113 --> 55:25.899
What are you doing
in Henry's office?

55:26.115 --> 55:29.073
Oh, you know, just going over
the books, learning the ropes.

55:29.285 --> 55:31.617
It ain't easy with you two
crackers out here

55:31.829 --> 55:33.114
making a lot of racket.

55:33.331 --> 55:35.196
-Where's Henry?
-He's off the clock.

55:35.416 --> 55:36.701
It's none of my concern.

55:37.084 --> 55:39.541
Why are you walking around
like you own this place?

55:39.754 --> 55:41.870
'Cause ever since your boy

55:42.089 --> 55:44.466
signed the deed over to me,
I do.

55:44.675 --> 55:46.085
[chuckles]

55:46.302 --> 55:48.293
Next round's on the house.

56:36.936 --> 56:38.676
[lid closes]

56:48.990 --> 56:51.732
[sighs]

56:57.748 --> 56:59.158
[beep]

56:59.375 --> 57:01.115
[telephone ringing]

57:02.461 --> 57:04.417
[beep]

57:04.630 --> 57:05.460
Hello?

57:05.673 --> 57:06.628
Hey, it's me.

57:06.841 --> 57:09.298
So, I have been to his house,

57:09.510 --> 57:10.716
the office,
the construction site.

57:10.928 --> 57:12.668
There is no sign of Nighthorse
anywhere.

57:12.889 --> 57:14.720
It's possible I alerted Jacob

57:14.932 --> 57:16.843
to our interest in him
earlier tonight.

57:17.059 --> 57:18.174
[Vic]
How?

57:18.394 --> 57:20.601
Malachi.
He overheard me talking

57:20.813 --> 57:22.269
to Doc Weston at the Red Pony,
so...

57:22.481 --> 57:24.517
Shit.

57:24.734 --> 57:26.349
[Walt] Yeah, uh,

57:26.569 --> 57:28.560
was there something else
you wanted to talk to me about?

57:28.779 --> 57:30.565
What? No.
Why?

57:30.781 --> 57:32.157
Well, it's, uh --

57:32.366 --> 57:34.618
it's just that H saw
you called earlier

57:34.827 --> 57:36.738
and didn't leave a message.

57:38.080 --> 57:39.945
Um, yeah, no, that was nothing.

57:40.124 --> 57:41.239
[Walt]
You sure?

57:41.459 --> 57:43.450
Yeah.
Get some sleep, Walt.

57:43.669 --> 57:45.045
[beep]

57:56.057 --> 57:58.264
[sighs]

58:10.279 --> 58:12.440
[vehicles approaching]

58:16.827 --> 58:18.033
[gun cocks]

59:03.416 --> 59:05.782
When General Custer looked out

59:06.002 --> 59:08.209
over the field
at Little Bighorn,

59:08.421 --> 59:11.003
do you think he had a moment
to reflect?

59:11.799 --> 59:13.084
IsuspecL

59:13.300 --> 59:14.585
And how do you think
he characterized

59:14.802 --> 59:17.339
his failure in his own mind?

59:17.555 --> 59:22.174
You think he felt he had
underestimated the Indians?

59:22.393 --> 59:24.054
Overestimated himself?

59:24.270 --> 59:25.601
What do you want, Jacob?

59:25.813 --> 59:27.895
I just want to talk.

59:28.107 --> 59:30.974
No lawyers, no bullshit.

59:31.193 --> 59:32.444
[Walt]
No bullshit?

59:32.653 --> 59:34.314
What do you call this display?

59:34.530 --> 59:38.273
This is just... backup.

59:38.492 --> 59:41.984
What do you want from me?

59:42.204 --> 59:43.580
Your head on a pike.

59:44.665 --> 59:47.873
Or barring that, prison.

59:48.085 --> 59:49.700
For what?

59:49.920 --> 59:52.878
What did I ever
really do to you, Walt?

59:53.090 --> 59:54.671
I believe you murdered Branch.

59:54.884 --> 59:56.169
Why would I murder Branch?

59:56.719 --> 59:58.459
Because he exposed your soldier.

59:58.679 --> 1:00:00.260
David Ridges.

1:00:02.767 --> 1:00:03.973
Yeah.

1:00:04.185 --> 1:00:05.550
But you killed him.

1:00:05.770 --> 1:00:09.354
[Walt] So, I take your deputy,
you take mine.

1:00:09.565 --> 1:00:12.978
Or maybe he found something out
that Ridges did for you.

1:00:15.488 --> 1:00:17.399
Like kill my wife.

1:00:18.866 --> 1:00:20.447
Oh.

1:00:22.286 --> 1:00:25.119
So, that's what this
is all about.

1:00:25.289 --> 1:00:27.075
That's what this is all about.

1:00:27.291 --> 1:00:31.079
Well, let me put your mind
at ease.

1:00:31.295 --> 1:00:33.377
ldon't kill women and children.

1:00:34.507 --> 1:00:38.841
In fact, in my experience
and the experience of my people,

1:00:39.053 --> 1:00:41.465
that's been more
of a white man's strategy.

1:00:41.680 --> 1:00:43.011
You once said you intended

1:00:43.224 --> 1:00:45.180
to fight the white man
on his terms.

1:00:45.392 --> 1:00:47.053
And I will.

1:00:47.269 --> 1:00:48.930
Harnessing the power

1:00:49.146 --> 1:00:51.933
of the almighty dollar
with casinos.

1:00:52.149 --> 1:00:54.356
You took our land.

1:00:54.568 --> 1:00:58.777
You killed us
with guns and disease.

1:00:58.989 --> 1:01:01.025
You lied to us.

1:01:01.242 --> 1:01:02.778
Shame on you!

1:01:02.993 --> 1:01:06.121
But we were naive.
We were gullible.

1:01:06.330 --> 1:01:08.992
We never came together
as a people, so shame on us.

1:01:11.252 --> 1:01:12.708
Look around you, Walt.

1:01:12.920 --> 1:01:16.378
Cheyenne, Blackfoot, Sioux,
Cherokee.

1:01:16.590 --> 1:01:18.546
Could it be

1:01:18.801 --> 1:01:23.090
we are no longer a beaten,
drunken, vanishing people?

1:01:23.305 --> 1:01:24.886
We are united.

1:01:25.099 --> 1:01:28.387
We will not be harassed
and intimidated anymore.

1:01:28.602 --> 1:01:30.513
These men have my back!

1:01:32.398 --> 1:01:34.480
And I have theirs.

1:01:34.692 --> 1:01:36.933
So, you're threatening me?
Is that it?

1:01:37.153 --> 1:01:41.863
I'm just giving you the warning
poor General Custer never got.

1:01:42.074 --> 1:01:45.566
Don't overestimate yourself.

1:01:45.786 --> 1:01:50.405
And don't underestimate us.

1:01:54.295 --> 1:01:55.580
Oh.

1:01:58.966 --> 1:02:00.456
All right, let's go!

1:02:00.676 --> 1:02:02.883
[speaks native language]

1:02:06.182 --> 1:02:07.843
