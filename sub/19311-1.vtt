00:41.376 --> 00:43.962
James Brown,
ladies and gentlemen.

00:44.170 --> 00:47.090
The hottest record man
in the world!

00:47.298 --> 00:49.259
James! James!

00:49.467 --> 00:53.304
<i>James! James! James!</i>

00:53.513 --> 00:57.934
<i>James! James! James!</i>

01:47.108 --> 01:49.235
A lot of people have tried
to define

01:49.444 --> 01:51.071
exactly what soul music is.

01:51.279 --> 01:52.447
How would you define it?

01:52.655 --> 01:55.241
It's the word "can't"
that makes you a soul singer.

01:56.451 --> 01:57.535
"Can't"

01:59.662 --> 02:01.831
I think one thing
that made a black man

02:02.040 --> 02:06.753
is more heavier for soul
coming from the States

02:06.961 --> 02:10.465
is because of the fact
that he had extra hard knocks

02:11.382 --> 02:13.468
and he lived with
the word "can't" for so long.

02:14.427 --> 02:16.638
So, every time
he can sing about it,

02:16.846 --> 02:18.056
it kind of...

02:20.058 --> 02:21.601
...comes out
a little bit stronger.

03:04.352 --> 03:05.854
<i>I want to tell you a little story.</i>

03:06.062 --> 03:08.606
<i>This is a thing that
they don't write in newspapers,</i>

03:08.815 --> 03:11.359
<i>or hear on a record, because
I am sure it wouldn't sell.</i>

03:24.581 --> 03:28.751
<i>My father being a very,
very poor man, undereducated,</i>

03:28.960 --> 03:31.379
<i>he only got a chance
to finish grade two.</i>

03:50.565 --> 03:53.568
There just was no way for me
to dream of becoming anything,

03:53.818 --> 03:56.446
but trying to be a...
just a laborer,

03:56.654 --> 03:57.822
trying to work, you know,

03:58.031 --> 03:59.991
because that's all
I could see around me.

04:00.200 --> 04:01.659
My father was a laborer.

04:01.868 --> 04:03.453
<i>I dreamed then of eating.</i>

04:11.920 --> 04:14.714
<i>When I was a kid, we would
go out and hustle the men</i>

04:15.215 --> 04:17.634
<i>for the women that was
practicing prostitution.</i>

04:23.556 --> 04:26.100
<i>And I had to buck dance
for the soldiers.</i>

04:26.309 --> 04:28.519
<i>They would throw quarters
and nickels to see me dance.</i>

04:35.610 --> 04:36.778
<i>And I used to sing a lot.</i>

04:37.278 --> 04:38.780
<i>I'd make up songs.</i>

04:49.749 --> 04:52.168
<i>The story of it
touched me so deeply.</i>

04:52.377 --> 04:54.879
- You were a shoe shine boy...
- In Augusta, Georgia.

04:55.255 --> 04:56.256
In Augusta, Georgia.

04:56.464 --> 04:58.465
And you carried the shoe shine
box around with you,

04:58.549 --> 05:00.885
and one thing I was reading
not too long ago,

05:01.094 --> 05:02.637
you held it up
as an example to kids.

05:02.845 --> 05:04.347
Would you tell that story?

05:04.555 --> 05:08.810
I said, with all of the success
and everything that you said

05:09.560 --> 05:12.272
it still don't get away the fact
that I come from the ghetto

05:12.480 --> 05:15.066
and that I got my shoeshine box
on my mind.

05:15.275 --> 05:17.819
And it broke the people up
because they were very glad

05:18.027 --> 05:20.196
that I still remembered.

05:39.465 --> 05:44.053
<i>It was Bobby Byrd's family that
took young James Brown in...</i>

05:44.262 --> 05:45.513
...when he got paroled

05:45.722 --> 05:50.018
<i>and really kind of helped him
find his feet.</i>

06:01.362 --> 06:03.406
<i>And then they went on
to create music together</i>

06:03.614 --> 06:05.491
<i>with the Famous Flames</i>

06:05.700 --> 06:08.953
<i>and Bobby Byrd had to be
humble enough to understand</i>

06:09.162 --> 06:10.955
<i>this used to be my group,</i>

06:11.164 --> 06:13.207
<i>but now I got this young guy
coming in here</i>

06:13.416 --> 06:14.792
<i>just kind of taking over.</i>

06:15.043 --> 06:17.128
<i>Well, he's got that thing,</i>

06:17.337 --> 06:18.713
<i>so I'm going to let him have it.</i>

06:19.922 --> 06:24.010
After he got out of prison
and at my home,

06:24.218 --> 06:25.928
<i>I asked him to join the group.</i>

06:26.137 --> 06:27.889
<i>Had a lot of dissension
in the group</i>

06:28.097 --> 06:31.142
<i>because they didn't know
what type of person he was,</i>

06:31.351 --> 06:33.144
<i>they know that
he was kind of rowdy,</i>

06:33.353 --> 06:35.646
<i>but when he started
doing some songs that he knew,</i>

06:35.855 --> 06:37.774
<i>gospel songs of course
during that time,</i>

06:37.982 --> 06:39.984
<i>something about it
was different.</i>

06:40.193 --> 06:45.448
<i>The rowdy type of thing,
the up-tempo, gutsy stuff.</i>

06:46.282 --> 06:48.993
And the reason we know it was
good because we start rehearsing

06:49.202 --> 06:51.079
and we had the porch
would be full of people

06:51.287 --> 06:54.499
and everybody peeping through
windows and that kind of thing.

06:54.707 --> 06:56.268
They didn't do that for no other
groups.

06:56.417 --> 06:57.460
I knew we had something.

07:08.137 --> 07:11.391
<i>At that time "Soul" was more
or less church slang, you know.</i>

07:11.599 --> 07:13.559
<i>They found that most rhythm
and blues sounds</i>

07:13.768 --> 07:16.048
came out of the church, so
they named them "soul singers."

07:16.896 --> 07:18.773
<i>When James Brown
and Bobby Byrd decided</i>

07:18.981 --> 07:21.776
<i>to put together the version
of the Famous Flames,</i>

07:21.984 --> 07:25.905
they took great care to not let
the people in the church know

07:26.114 --> 07:29.117
that they were doing the
secular music on Saturday night

07:29.325 --> 07:31.911
and coming in and singing
in church on Sunday night,

07:32.120 --> 07:33.871
because that was taboo.

07:39.043 --> 07:43.089
A lot of people I liked
in the past, Louis Jordan...

07:47.844 --> 07:50.513
<i>Mr. Brown says, "Louis Jordan
was my biggest hero"</i>

07:50.721 --> 07:52.282
<i>"because he could sing,
he could dance,"</i>

07:52.473 --> 07:54.392
<i>"he could act, he could play."</i>

07:54.600 --> 07:56.436
"And he had good hair
and good teeth."

08:01.357 --> 08:03.276
<i>It's the longevity
of Louis Jordan's career</i>

08:03.484 --> 08:05.684
<i>that had an impact, the way
he handled his own business,</i>

08:05.820 --> 08:07.101
<i>the fact that he was doing music</i>

08:07.196 --> 08:10.700
that was a hybrid of blues,
swing music, bebop.

08:12.577 --> 08:14.787
<i>That music was
the R&B to rock and roll,</i>

08:14.996 --> 08:16.539
<i>the hip-hop of its time.</i>

08:18.583 --> 08:21.836
And James actually considered
himself a jazzman at heart.

08:22.044 --> 08:23.546
It's a pleasure
to present to you

08:23.754 --> 08:26.799
the one and only Duke Ellington.

08:35.765 --> 08:39.854
James Brown, he liked big bands,
he liked a big horn section

08:40.062 --> 08:43.357
<i>and he liked instrumentals,
he liked arranging.</i>

08:43.816 --> 08:46.360
He liked to be a bandleader.

09:00.791 --> 09:06.214
<i>He carried some of that past,
of the swing era in a funny way.</i>

09:14.639 --> 09:17.141
<i>It's always been soul with me,
ever since I've been singing.</i>

09:17.475 --> 09:18.976
<i>It was my opportunity,
it was my knock on the door.</i>

09:19.227 --> 09:20.394
THE JAMES BROWN SHOW

09:21.646 --> 09:24.190
<i>Soul is survival.</i>

09:25.900 --> 09:29.445
<i>And a lot of days I sang
and we got 25 cents.</i>

09:33.449 --> 09:35.010
<i>But I knew it was something
I had to do.</i>

09:36.160 --> 09:38.454
<i>Every time I got the opportunity
I did everything I could.</i>

09:38.663 --> 09:41.582
<i>The hardest part was being black
and being allowed to perform.</i>

09:43.334 --> 09:45.336
<i>Not even black at that time.
Colored.</i>

09:47.129 --> 09:49.507
<i>That's what you call
the segregated years.</i>

09:49.715 --> 09:51.884
I came up through those years

09:52.093 --> 09:54.095
<i>and I never will forget
some things</i>

09:54.303 --> 09:55.513
<i>that happened with us.</i>

09:55.721 --> 09:57.640
<i>It's behind me
but I won't forget them.</i>

09:57.848 --> 10:00.434
You've got to keep the white
and the black separate!

10:00.893 --> 10:04.313
James Brown, he was a father
I never had in many ways.

10:04.522 --> 10:07.042
He said, "You didn't know about
sitting at the back of the bus."

10:07.650 --> 10:11.946
I used to have to perform
in clubs

10:12.154 --> 10:14.073
<i>that I'd have to get dressed
in the bus</i>

10:14.282 --> 10:16.534
because I wasn't allowed
to use the dressing room.

10:18.995 --> 10:21.622
They didn't like black folks,
I'll put it that way.

10:21.872 --> 10:24.208
They didn't like black folks.

10:28.296 --> 10:30.673
Boy, what we went through.
What we went through.

10:35.845 --> 10:38.806
<i>You played what you called
the chitlin' circuit.</i>

10:39.765 --> 10:43.853
All of the gigs that you'd play
were for black audiences.

10:45.688 --> 10:47.773
<i>A lot of down-home
Southern places</i>

10:47.982 --> 10:49.692
<i>that were kind of rough,
you know.</i>

10:49.900 --> 10:52.403
I remember being
in Mr. Brown's dressing room...

10:52.945 --> 10:56.782
and something happened with
the promoter didn't want to pay,

10:56.991 --> 10:59.744
and everybody started pulling
out their guns and everything.

10:59.952 --> 11:01.553
And, you know,
I was frightened to death.

11:02.705 --> 11:05.499
<i>That was definitely the
chitlin' circuit at that time.</i>

11:09.378 --> 11:11.088
James Brown said,
"You have to remember, Reverend,"

11:11.297 --> 11:14.050
"when I was coming up,
you had to be tall,"

11:14.258 --> 11:17.970
<i>"light-skinned, long wavy hair
like Jackie or Smokey Robinson."</i>

11:19.055 --> 11:22.141
<i>And I was short,
had African features</i>

11:22.350 --> 11:23.601
<i>and I didn't have any</i>

11:23.809 --> 11:27.897
<i>of what was considered beautiful
at that time.</i>

11:28.105 --> 11:32.443
<i>I was determined to out dance
and out sing everybody out there</i>

11:32.652 --> 11:34.153
and I was going to work
every night.

11:34.362 --> 11:35.613
<i>James actually said,</i>

11:35.821 --> 11:38.991
<i>Little Richard and Hank Ballard
and the Midnighters were</i>

11:39.200 --> 11:41.327
probably the two
greatest influences

11:41.535 --> 11:43.412
<i>on him and really
that whole generation,</i>

11:43.621 --> 11:45.456
<i>moving out of gospel into doing</i>

11:45.665 --> 11:48.084
<i>what was called rock 'n' roll
or R&B.</i>

12:02.348 --> 12:03.724
<i>I was in Toccoa, Georgia</i>

12:04.016 --> 12:06.560
<i>and Little Richard came down
from Macon and saw me,</i>

12:06.811 --> 12:09.897
<i>and told his manager about me
and I went back to Macon.</i>

12:10.106 --> 12:12.108
<i>I got to give Little Richard
that credit, you know.</i>

12:15.069 --> 12:17.988
Little Richard got a big
contract to record in

12:18.197 --> 12:20.950
Los Angeles and he left behind
about 30 dates

12:21.158 --> 12:22.827
<i>that the management
was committed to,</i>

12:23.035 --> 12:25.621
<i>so they had the bright idea
to have James Brown go out</i>

12:25.830 --> 12:27.665
and impersonate Little Richard.

12:30.292 --> 12:32.628
<i>And so they let him do
a little bit of Little Richard</i>

12:32.837 --> 12:34.130
<i>and he would do
a little bit of James Brown.</i>

12:34.338 --> 12:36.298
<i>That's where James Brown
really learned to scream,</i>

12:36.507 --> 12:38.759
being Little Richard
for about two weeks.

12:44.223 --> 12:45.223
<i>It was before television,</i>

12:45.391 --> 12:47.435
<i>so nobody knew
what Richard really looked like.</i>

12:47.643 --> 12:48.978
<i>He said, "And my goal was,"</i>

12:49.186 --> 12:50.747
"I was going to be bigger
than Richard."

13:20.968 --> 13:24.805
<i>The word is that when Syd
Nathan, who ran King Records,</i>

13:25.014 --> 13:28.726
<i>heard them rehearsing the song,
he fired the A&R guy.</i>

13:28.976 --> 13:30.561
<i>Could not hear it being a hit.</i>

13:30.770 --> 13:32.104
He said, all this guy does is

13:32.313 --> 13:33.481
say "please, please, please"

13:33.689 --> 13:34.982
like, 17 times.

13:35.274 --> 13:36.442
<i>Mr. Brown snuck it out,</i>

13:36.650 --> 13:38.319
<i>got it to the radio stations
and it became a hit,</i>

13:38.527 --> 13:41.363
<i>and Syd Nathan just had to
swallow his disdain.</i>

13:57.713 --> 13:59.924
<i>I guess my all time
favorite tune would be,</i>

14:00.132 --> 14:01.300
"Please, Please, Please" now,

14:01.509 --> 14:03.789
- because that's the tune...
- That's the one that did it.

14:03.803 --> 14:05.554
<i>Yeah.
It gave me that extra meal.</i>

14:05.763 --> 14:08.015
<i>You think you wanted success
so badly at the time</i>

14:08.224 --> 14:10.344
that you were really singing
"please, please, please."

14:10.476 --> 14:11.852
I wanted to eat, period, man.

14:12.061 --> 14:13.479
<i>That's Why I did it.</i>

14:33.499 --> 14:36.335
<i>He's begging, "I got to have you,
I need you in my life."</i>

14:36.544 --> 14:39.463
"You got to come on,
my heart is shattered..."

14:40.214 --> 14:41.590
<i>...and the women would go:</i>

14:41.799 --> 14:45.386
"Somebody really hurt that man,
oh, they hurt him so badly,

14:45.636 --> 14:47.304
I feel so sorry for him."

14:47.680 --> 14:49.223
It worked all over the world.

15:01.777 --> 15:04.321
For some reason I grew up
with a passion for black music.

15:07.074 --> 15:09.910
<i>I was a disc jockey at a black
radio station in Richmond.</i>

15:11.787 --> 15:13.307
<i>I loved James Brown
like everybody else</i>

15:13.372 --> 15:15.092
<i>that was into black music
in the early '60s.</i>

15:15.124 --> 15:17.204
<i>At some point you discover
James Brown and it's like,</i>

15:17.251 --> 15:19.003
"Oh, my god,
this is the gold standard."

15:28.721 --> 15:30.764
<i>The first time I saw James Brown
perform live</i>

15:30.973 --> 15:33.684
was in the fall of 1963,

15:33.893 --> 15:36.854
<i>and I had never experienced
anything like it.</i>

15:38.022 --> 15:40.608
<i>The energy that was in the room,</i>

15:40.816 --> 15:43.527
<i>it was like going
into another dimension.</i>

15:45.154 --> 15:46.530
<i>In the '50s and '60s,</i>

15:46.739 --> 15:49.783
<i>black music
and pop mainstream music,</i>

15:49.992 --> 15:53.454
<i>the segregation was even more
rigid than it is today.</i>

15:53.662 --> 15:57.374
The black music industry
was entirely dependent

15:57.583 --> 15:58.584
<i>on black radio,</i>

15:58.792 --> 16:00.502
<i>and the whole goal became,</i>

16:00.711 --> 16:02.713
<i>how do we cross
these records over?</i>

16:02.922 --> 16:04.798
<i>Because a hit on pop radio</i>

16:05.007 --> 16:06.842
<i>represented
as much as a million,</i>

16:07.051 --> 16:08.844
<i>a million-and-a-half more sales.</i>

16:29.907 --> 16:31.067
<i>After I got "Please, Please,"</i>

16:31.075 --> 16:32.743
<i>it took me three years
to get another hit.</i>

16:32.952 --> 16:33.953
<i>But I wouldn't give up,</i>

16:34.161 --> 16:37.706
<i>and my next hit was a tune
entitled "Try Me."</i>

16:46.423 --> 16:50.010
<i>Somebody like Elvis, one record
would sell ten or 15 million,</i>

16:50.219 --> 16:52.763
<i>and see, I would have to come
through the race era,</i>

16:52.972 --> 16:55.891
<i>when my records were classed
as R&B and race music.</i>

17:02.648 --> 17:05.651
<i>I'm just trying to figure out
the market like a stock man,</i>

17:05.858 --> 17:07.653
<i>trying to see
what the people will go for.</i>

17:07.861 --> 17:09.238
<i>I always worked hard
on the stage,</i>

17:09.445 --> 17:12.366
<i>but you still need that record
as a performer, you know.</i>

17:12.574 --> 17:14.034
<i>Everyone needs a hit record.</i>

17:14.785 --> 17:17.079
James Brown was an anomaly
in the industry,

17:17.287 --> 17:19.039
<i>not just in his ambition,</i>

17:19.248 --> 17:20.749
<i>but he also had a situation</i>

17:20.958 --> 17:23.252
<i>that was pretty much
unlike any other artist.</i>

17:23.669 --> 17:25.170
<i>He had a manager
who embraced him</i>

17:25.378 --> 17:27.172
<i>and became a mentor
father figure,</i>

17:27.381 --> 17:28.966
<i>who was Ben Bart.</i>

17:29.174 --> 17:32.177
Ben taught James
a lot of the music business

17:32.386 --> 17:33.846
and how to handle things.

17:34.388 --> 17:37.391
<i>And Ben really loved him,
and James loved him.</i>

17:37.975 --> 17:41.687
It was kind of a
father-son thing going on there.

17:41.895 --> 17:45.190
<i>Ben was doing everything
he could to move the act,</i>

17:45.399 --> 17:48.068
<i>but James had his own idea
about things.</i>

17:49.445 --> 17:51.405
<i>So now, ladies and gentlemen,
it is Star Time.</i>

17:51.613 --> 17:53.157
<i>Are you ready for Star Time?</i>

17:55.492 --> 17:57.411
<i>Thank you,
and thank you very kindly.</i>

17:57.619 --> 17:58.780
<i>It is indeed a great pleasure</i>

17:58.954 --> 18:00.956
<i>to present to you
at this particular time,</i>

18:01.165 --> 18:03.625
<i>national and international known</i>

18:03.834 --> 18:06.128
<i>as "The Hardest-Working Man
In Show Business."</i>

18:06.336 --> 18:08.130
<i>Here to sing "I'll Go Crazy,"</i>

18:10.591 --> 18:11.967
<i>"Try Me,"</i>

18:13.510 --> 18:16.805
<i>"Mr. Dynamite," the amazing
"Mr. Please, Please" himself,</i>

18:17.014 --> 18:18.014
<i>the star of the show,</i>

18:18.182 --> 18:20.726
<i>James Brown
and the Famous Flames.</i>

18:31.570 --> 18:33.614
<i>He would go up
to the Apollo Theater</i>

18:33.822 --> 18:35.949
<i>and they'd be standing
around the Apollo Theater</i>

18:36.158 --> 18:37.284
<i>for the next show</i>

18:37.493 --> 18:40.162
and that'd be around
from one end of the Apollo

18:40.454 --> 18:43.248
around to the other end.
And that's around the block.

18:44.625 --> 18:46.126
And they'd be standing there
for the next one.

18:46.335 --> 18:48.375
<i>That next show let out,
and they let them people in,</i>

18:48.462 --> 18:51.298
<i>and then another line is there,
waiting to get in.</i>

18:51.507 --> 18:54.968
<i>Unbelievable!
And those blocks are not short.</i>

18:56.261 --> 18:57.721
They made money.

19:06.980 --> 19:09.983
James Brown is just so linked
with the Apollo

19:10.192 --> 19:13.821
<i>in terms of a standard that
was set, in the '60s onward.</i>

19:14.029 --> 19:16.115
<i>It was the peak
of the chitlin' circuit,</i>

19:16.323 --> 19:17.491
so the bands would be
touring around

19:17.699 --> 19:19.660
and they would arrive
in New York City

19:19.868 --> 19:23.247
<i>to show off what they had been
honing on the road.</i>

19:23.455 --> 19:25.874
<i>You'd play about six shows
a day,</i>

19:26.792 --> 19:29.962
<i>each show is about two hours,
and that's a lot.</i>

19:31.505 --> 19:34.216
I remember going there,
and I sat in the balcony.

19:35.134 --> 19:37.334
<i>And there was this sort of
older lady sitting next to me</i>

19:37.469 --> 19:38.804
smoking a big joint.

19:39.763 --> 19:41.598
And I didn't know
that older ladies smoked,

19:41.807 --> 19:43.433
you know, I was a kid.

19:44.351 --> 19:46.854
<i>The James Brown show,
it was like a Revue show.</i>

19:47.896 --> 19:49.398
The band would play
instrumentals,

19:49.606 --> 19:51.441
<i>a female singer would come on,</i>

19:51.650 --> 19:53.735
<i>then Bobby Byrd would come on
and sing.</i>

19:53.944 --> 19:56.905
"TV Mama",
they said she was five by five.

19:57.114 --> 20:00.826
She was five feet tall
and very wide,

20:01.034 --> 20:03.370
<i>and she would sing
the song "All Of Me".</i>

20:03.579 --> 20:05.706
<i>"All of me,
why not take all of me?"</i>

20:05.914 --> 20:09.126
Then he would come on eventually
and do, you know, his show.

20:18.218 --> 20:20.888
<i>Apart from the fact
that it was very entertaining,</i>

20:21.096 --> 20:23.557
I was obviously learning
from him, you know,

20:23.765 --> 20:26.101
<i>trying to steal everything
I could possibly do.</i>

20:31.398 --> 20:35.068
Seeing him dancing
and doing the audience rapport.

20:45.204 --> 20:48.165
<i>Especially very young girls
would go to the front</i>

20:48.373 --> 20:52.711
and be screaming and carrying on
in all these places

20:52.920 --> 20:55.964
where he's,
he's teasing them to do,

20:56.173 --> 20:59.176
you know, he's like,
in total control of them.

21:38.465 --> 21:40.300
Danny Ray was the
so-called "Cape Man."

21:40.509 --> 21:42.678
<i>He was the guy
during "Please, Please, Please"</i>

21:42.886 --> 21:45.514
<i>that would drape that cape
over Brown.</i>

21:47.224 --> 21:48.517
<i>James told me that</i>

21:48.725 --> 21:51.436
<i>he was watching Gorgeous George
the wrestler one day,</i>

21:51.645 --> 21:53.480
<i>after the match
they'd throw a cape on him</i>

21:53.689 --> 21:55.107
<i>and he said he liked that.</i>

22:10.289 --> 22:13.375
<i>Between that period of "Please,
Please, Please" and "Try Me,"</i>

22:13.583 --> 22:15.836
<i>there were a gazillion singles
released,</i>

22:16.044 --> 22:17.645
and none of them
were really catching on.

22:17.838 --> 22:19.506
He felt like,
"Man, if people knew..."

22:19.715 --> 22:22.009
"...what I was offering
on the stage,"

22:22.217 --> 22:23.338
"they would come in droves."

22:29.558 --> 22:31.476
<i>Syd Nathan,
who ran King Records,</i>

22:31.685 --> 22:32.936
<i>didn't want to back it.</i>

22:33.562 --> 22:35.897
Mr. Brown says,
"No, this has got to happen."

22:36.106 --> 22:37.482
"I know better than this guy,

22:37.691 --> 22:39.531
you know, about my audience
about my business."

22:39.693 --> 22:42.779
<i>Mr. Brown paid
for the recording himself.</i>

22:52.372 --> 22:57.210
<i>That was a huge album,
and it was the worst album.</i>

22:57.419 --> 23:00.630
<i>Screams and stuff all over it,
cymbals falling,</i>

23:01.423 --> 23:04.134
and they put that out,
just like that.

23:22.611 --> 23:28.575
Every black household had
"Live at the Apollo Volume One".

23:29.326 --> 23:31.536
<i>Mine included.
Like that album was so powerful,</i>

23:31.745 --> 23:34.915
<i>DJs would love to play
the entire side.</i>

23:43.840 --> 23:47.219
<i>His first million seller was the
"Live at the Apollo Volume One."</i>

23:47.427 --> 23:50.847
It really just kind of blows up
on the national marketplace.

23:54.935 --> 23:56.269
For an R&B record
to be released in England

23:56.478 --> 23:57.478
it had to be quite big.

23:59.940 --> 24:02.067
<i>Everyone had that record
and they played it to death.</i>

24:05.987 --> 24:08.949
<i>He did want the benefits
of crossing over.</i>

24:09.157 --> 24:13.036
He resented being pigeonholed
as a "race artist,"

24:13.245 --> 24:17.249
<i>but he embraced what that meant
emotionally and culturally,</i>

24:17.457 --> 24:20.585
<i>so it was a very, very thin line
he was walking.</i>

24:29.928 --> 24:33.890
<i>Again and again, we must rise
to the majestic heights</i>

24:34.766 --> 24:37.602
<i>of meeting physical force
with soul force.</i>

24:40.147 --> 24:43.275
<i>We're nonviolent with people
who are nonviolent with us.</i>

24:47.696 --> 24:51.533
<i>My fellow Americans,
I am about to sign into law</i>

24:51.741 --> 24:54.077
<i>the civil rights act of 1964.</i>

24:54.995 --> 24:58.165
This civil rights act
is a challenge to all of us,

24:58.373 --> 24:59.666
<i>to eliminate the</i>

24:59.916 --> 25:03.962
<i>last vestiges of injustice
in our beloved country.</i>

25:07.591 --> 25:12.637
The James Brown tour
was able to do hundreds of shows

25:12.888 --> 25:14.848
all over black America,

25:15.098 --> 25:18.185
<i>grossing about a million dollars
a year.</i>

25:20.937 --> 25:23.356
We're talking about '63, '64,

25:23.565 --> 25:25.358
<i>he became a millionaire quietly,</i>

25:25.567 --> 25:29.196
<i>so a lot of what the civil
rights movement was trying to do</i>

25:29.404 --> 25:31.740
<i>in terms of the hope
of economic justice,</i>

25:31.948 --> 25:34.284
he's already been to the top
of that mountaintop.

25:34.701 --> 25:36.953
<i>He's a civil rights movement
of one.</i>

25:39.080 --> 25:42.250
<i>This is the group that was there
in 1964,</i>

25:42.459 --> 25:44.127
<i>that's Maceo in the back.</i>

25:44.794 --> 25:47.339
<i>That's Melvin Parker,
19 years old.</i>

25:47.547 --> 25:50.383
James told me,
"If you ever need a job,"

25:50.592 --> 25:52.177
"playing those drums
the way you play,"

25:52.385 --> 25:53.678
"you have a job with me."

25:53.929 --> 25:55.388
I said, "Oh, by the way..."

25:55.597 --> 25:57.182
"This is my brother,
my brother Maceo,"

25:57.390 --> 25:59.100
"he's a saxophone player."

25:59.684 --> 26:01.520
"He needs a job, too."

26:01.728 --> 26:04.064
He said, "Well, I don't need
a saxophone player."

26:05.023 --> 26:06.566
And I gave him that look.

26:08.777 --> 26:11.655
He said, "Oh, just a minute,
wait a minute, wait a minute,"

26:11.863 --> 26:13.573
"we had,
we need a baritone player."

26:13.782 --> 26:15.422
"My baritone player left
the other night."

26:15.534 --> 26:17.536
He said, "Can you
play baritone?" to Maceo.

26:17.744 --> 26:20.121
My major instrument at the time
was the tenor saxophone,

26:20.330 --> 26:21.790
but I answer like this, "Uhhh,"

26:21.998 --> 26:25.168
with a long "Uhhh",
yes, sir, yes, yes I do."

26:25.377 --> 26:26.586
I can't say no.

26:26.920 --> 26:28.001
He said, "I tell you what,"

26:28.171 --> 26:30.173
"you can meet us,
along with your brother,"

26:30.549 --> 26:32.717
"two nights following."

26:33.552 --> 26:34.594
"How about that?"

26:34.803 --> 26:37.597
And we would go,
"wow, this is great."

26:37.806 --> 26:39.766
<i>And then we got
The T.A.M.I. Show,</i>

26:39.975 --> 26:41.142
<i>now that was fun.</i>

26:49.234 --> 26:52.988
<i>I have been in the
black community ever since '56,</i>

26:53.196 --> 26:56.408
<i>but it really started happening
for me in 1964.</i>

26:56.741 --> 26:58.502
<i>I had the pleasure
of doing The T.A.M.I. Show</i>

26:58.577 --> 27:01.288
<i>with the Rolling Stones,
Gerry and the Pacemakers,</i>

27:01.496 --> 27:04.541
<i>the Supremes,
all the major acts, you know.</i>

27:05.959 --> 27:08.962
<i>It made the white America
familiar with James Brown,</i>

27:09.170 --> 27:10.255
<i>and what he was doing.</i>

27:26.354 --> 27:28.147
The T.A.M.I. Show was
a major breakthrough.

27:28.356 --> 27:29.816
<i>It pitted Brown,</i>

27:30.025 --> 27:32.986
<i>who had largely been confined
to the chitlin' circuit,</i>

27:33.194 --> 27:34.321
<i>against all these artists</i>

27:34.529 --> 27:36.740
<i>who were tearing the country up
at that time.</i>

27:49.753 --> 27:51.964
<i>The T.A.M.I. Show
is not really a show.</i>

27:52.172 --> 27:53.423
<i>It was shot like a movie.</i>

27:53.632 --> 27:55.133
<i>You break for an hour,</i>

27:55.342 --> 27:57.177
and then the other act comes on
and then they break for an hour,

27:57.385 --> 27:58.762
then they re-light
and they change the audience,

27:58.970 --> 28:00.263
and another act comes on.

28:09.481 --> 28:11.900
<i>The story goes
that James Brown is annoyed</i>

28:12.108 --> 28:13.735
<i>that he is not closing the show,</i>

28:14.235 --> 28:17.489
and so I was asked
by the producers of the show

28:17.697 --> 28:19.366
<i>to go and talk to him
because I knew him.</i>

28:19.574 --> 28:21.743
<i>I said, "sure," you know,
I was, what, 20 years old.</i>

28:21.951 --> 28:23.953
<i>I was supposed to talk him down
and say:</i>

28:24.329 --> 28:25.789
"Yeah, don't worry it's a movie,"

28:25.997 --> 28:27.624
"you don't know what's
going to happen in the movie."

28:27.832 --> 28:29.125
"They may, you know, cut it..."

28:29.334 --> 28:31.503
which, which ever,
which is all true,

28:31.711 --> 28:34.130
<i>but I mean,
that wasn't really the point</i>

28:34.339 --> 28:35.740
<i>as far as James Brown
was concerned.</i>

28:35.840 --> 28:37.676
He wasn't really that mad,

28:37.884 --> 28:40.136
but he was a bit pissed off,
I think.

28:45.850 --> 28:47.852
<i>Well, wait a second,
wait a second...</i>

28:48.061 --> 28:49.562
<i>He apparently said
something like,</i>

28:49.771 --> 28:51.314
"Well, I'm going to kill."

28:51.523 --> 28:54.317
Well, fine,
but that, that's good.

28:55.527 --> 28:56.569
He did.

30:19.319 --> 30:22.447
<i>It was definitely an apotheosis.</i>

30:22.739 --> 30:26.576
<i>You were distraught to
where you'd collapse in begging.</i>

30:26.785 --> 30:28.912
<i>But somehow
the strength sweeps you up,</i>

30:29.704 --> 30:31.748
and then you rise
like a phoenix again.

30:38.421 --> 30:41.382
<i>And people you could watch
in the audience</i>

30:41.591 --> 30:42.759
<i>would go through this,</i>

30:43.134 --> 30:45.178
<i>probably reliving
their own lives.</i>

31:15.542 --> 31:19.587
<i>The idea is that he's got to be
taken away against his own will.</i>

31:20.046 --> 31:21.714
It's just not good for him
to do anymore.

31:28.429 --> 31:31.766
<i>It's obviously an act,
but you worry about him.</i>

31:36.646 --> 31:38.523
<i>The people would say,
"Oh, don't take him.</i>

31:38.731 --> 31:40.024
He must be looked after."

31:40.233 --> 31:42.443
You know, "I want to be the one
to look after him."

31:45.113 --> 31:47.740
Are you ready
for the "Night Train"?

31:49.784 --> 31:51.786
<i>When we got to "Night Train",</i>

31:51.995 --> 31:53.246
<i>Sam, the bass player,
whispered in my ear.</i>

31:53.454 --> 31:54.789
<i>He said, "Melvin."</i>

31:54.998 --> 31:57.417
"Let's see if those guys
can keep up with us."

31:58.001 --> 32:00.295
<i>Night! Night!</i>

32:00.503 --> 32:03.965
He said, "Night! Night! Train!"

32:08.386 --> 32:10.305
It was off to the races...

32:28.907 --> 32:31.284
<i>There's that famous story
of Mick Jagger</i>

32:31.534 --> 32:33.828
standing off the side of the
stage watching Brown,

32:34.037 --> 32:36.831
and just being devastated
and traumatized.

33:05.693 --> 33:07.987
No, that's bullshit, because
the whole place was cleared.

33:08.196 --> 33:10.281
And, like,
they re-lit the whole thing.

33:21.960 --> 33:26.089
<i>Now it went to another audience
and screaming teenage girls.</i>

33:26.798 --> 33:28.841
<i>I don't think
they'd even seen James Brown.</i>

33:29.050 --> 33:30.677
<i>And it was hours later.</i>

33:44.273 --> 33:47.318
So, what I said to him
was actually true.

33:47.527 --> 33:52.073
But if you watch the film,
then you see us up against him.

33:52.281 --> 33:53.491
So <i>it's</i> a bit...

34:00.832 --> 34:02.232
Then you go,
like, "Well, you know,"

34:02.375 --> 34:04.415
"they're not quite as good
as James Brown for real."

34:04.544 --> 34:07.797
But, you know, whatever.

34:13.553 --> 34:15.179
<i>We were performing
at the Howard Theater.</i>

34:15.388 --> 34:16.388
We were on stage,

34:16.556 --> 34:19.225
it was such a big ruckus
in the audience.

34:19.434 --> 34:21.310
<i>You know, and I said,
we must be getting down.</i>

34:21.518 --> 34:23.520
The people getting crazy
out there in the audience,

34:23.646 --> 34:25.940
making all that noise,
jumping up and down.

34:26.149 --> 34:28.234
Of course,
James Brown in the audience.

34:28.443 --> 34:34.072
You know, so, it was so exciting
to meet James Brown, 1965.

34:34.282 --> 34:35.616
He was at his peak.

34:37.201 --> 34:40.288
<i>He asked us,
would we travel with him.</i>

34:40.496 --> 34:42.123
<i>It was like, oh, my God.</i>

34:43.206 --> 34:44.958
<i>And he gave me the name High.</i>

34:45.793 --> 34:48.379
My name is Martha Harvin.

34:49.839 --> 34:52.967
But he said to me one day,
"Martha Harvin,"

34:54.302 --> 34:56.094
"that's not a name for the stage."

34:57.013 --> 34:58.848
"I got to come up
with a name for you."

34:59.599 --> 35:02.101
"Let me see.
What should I call you?"

35:02.310 --> 35:03.436
"I know."

35:04.353 --> 35:07.315
"I'm going to call you
'Martha High.' "

35:08.149 --> 35:09.525
And I said, Martha High?

35:09.734 --> 35:10.943
"How you like that?"

35:11.444 --> 35:13.696
And I said, oh, okay.

35:15.448 --> 35:17.283
"Martha High,
that's what it's going to be."

35:18.159 --> 35:20.661
<i>He wanted everything.
He wanted your all.</i>

35:20.870 --> 35:22.288
<i>And he gave his all.</i>

35:45.103 --> 35:49.107
<i>Up until "Papa's Got
A Brand New Bag" in 1965,</i>

35:49.315 --> 35:51.234
all of the James Brown stuff
seemed pretty traditional.

35:51.442 --> 35:54.445
It was like kind of coming out
of this blues gospel feel.

35:55.947 --> 36:00.159
<i>That, coupled with his love for
jazz and embracing the unknown,</i>

36:00.535 --> 36:05.039
<i>it came as the early ingredients
of what we call funk.</i>

36:29.730 --> 36:32.233
<i>"Papa's Got A Brand New Bag"
had the guitar sound.</i>

36:32.817 --> 36:35.027
James heard it.
"Jimmy, give me this."

36:39.073 --> 36:41.159
I mean, the funk was just there.

36:54.755 --> 36:57.049
<i>Now what you had
was called a vamp.</i>

36:57.258 --> 37:01.012
Vamps were only used
mostly in live performances.

37:01.304 --> 37:04.599
<i>The vocalist wanted to talk
to the audience and jive around.</i>

37:14.609 --> 37:17.236
<i>Now of course, in his live
shows, he vamped all the time.</i>

37:17.445 --> 37:19.655
<i>But nobody would ever think
to go in the studio</i>

37:19.864 --> 37:20.864
<i>and record the vamp.</i>

37:21.032 --> 37:25.411
You don't take a two bar phrase
and repeat it ad nauseam

37:25.620 --> 37:26.954
and call that a song.

37:27.163 --> 37:29.290
<i>That's exactly what James Brown</i>

37:29.540 --> 37:31.375
<i>wound up doing
through that period.</i>

38:08.621 --> 38:10.039
It was James Brown.

38:54.792 --> 38:56.335
<i>I think, without question,</i>

38:56.544 --> 39:02.383
Alfred "Pee Wee" Ellis is one
of the most important co-pilots

39:02.591 --> 39:04.218
of the James Brown sound.

39:13.394 --> 39:17.606
<i>Pee Wee's seriousness
and his sense of</i> jazz

39:17.815 --> 39:20.443
<i>and understanding
what Mr. Brown was going for.</i>

39:20.651 --> 39:24.780
I think the two of them really
were a quite a formidable team.

39:30.619 --> 39:31.746
I got drafted.

39:32.455 --> 39:34.248
<i>James mentioned to me</i>

39:34.457 --> 39:37.668
<i>that he was thinking about
getting Bobby Bland's drummer,</i>

39:37.877 --> 39:39.295
Jab'o, to join the group.

39:39.503 --> 39:41.839
I said, yes, that's what you do.

39:42.548 --> 39:46.260
<i>James Brown had been listening
to Bobby</i>

39:46.469 --> 39:49.221
<i>and he sent one of his people</i>

39:49.430 --> 39:52.183
to ask me
if I wanted to join his band.

39:52.808 --> 39:55.936
<i>He said "Whatever they're paying
you over there with Bobby,"</i>

39:56.520 --> 39:58.022
"I will double that."

39:58.939 --> 40:01.442
But then you have to understand
when I joined that band,

40:01.650 --> 40:03.778
what was going on
when I first got there, too.

40:05.780 --> 40:07.865
<i>Five drummers on stage.</i>

40:11.243 --> 40:14.246
Maybe two weeks after that,
he hired Clyde.

40:16.165 --> 40:19.668
He took me out on stage
and there was five drum sets.

40:21.128 --> 40:24.507
Five drummers on his show,
I went, oh, my God!

40:25.299 --> 40:28.010
You know? All these drummers.
What do he want me for?

40:30.096 --> 40:31.416
<i>He says,
"Pick out a set of drums.</i>

40:31.555 --> 40:33.891
<i>We going to do a little jam.
See what you do."</i>

40:34.350 --> 40:37.186
And I was scared, number one.
I was totally scared.

40:37.395 --> 40:39.271
I was going,
God, what am I doing?

40:41.190 --> 40:43.025
<i>And I left out of there
and went to the dressing room</i>

40:43.234 --> 40:44.693
<i>where the band was dressing.</i>

40:44.902 --> 40:47.071
<i>And there was Jab'o
sitting in there.</i>

40:47.363 --> 40:49.782
I said, who you used to play for
before you came here?

40:49.990 --> 40:50.990
He says, "Bobby Bland."

40:51.158 --> 40:53.577
I said, you played
with Bobby Bland?

40:53.786 --> 40:55.329
That was one of my favorites.

40:55.538 --> 40:57.665
<i>And that's when Jab'o and I said,
man, we're not playing enough.</i>

40:57.873 --> 40:59.708
<i>We got to get rid
of some of these drummers.</i>

41:00.084 --> 41:02.211
<i>I go, yeah, man.
We got to get rid of them.</i>

41:02.586 --> 41:04.505
<i>So we started knocking them off</i>

41:04.797 --> 41:06.715
<i>until it got down
to Jab'o and I.</i>

41:06.924 --> 41:10.344
Jabo's style
is more of a blues shuffle.

41:10.553 --> 41:11.554
Like...

41:17.101 --> 41:19.145
My style is...

41:24.024 --> 41:28.028
He plays jazz and blues more,
and I played funk and soul.

41:28.237 --> 41:30.406
We took it over. We had it.

41:32.658 --> 41:33.659
<i>Attention, everyone.</i>

41:33.868 --> 41:36.245
<i>James Brown is coming
to your area.</i>

41:36.454 --> 41:38.094
The show everyone
has been waiting to see.

41:38.164 --> 41:39.915
<i>The dynamic king
of rock and roll.</i>

41:40.124 --> 41:42.668
<i>Star of stage, screen
and television, James Brown!</i>

41:42.877 --> 41:45.296
<i>And his big variety show for '66</i>

41:45.504 --> 41:47.715
<i>featuring Bobby Byrd,
the Famous Flames,</i>

41:47.923 --> 41:50.134
<i>James Crawford,
"TV Mama" Elsie Mae,</i>

41:50.342 --> 41:51.342
<i>The Jewels.</i>

41:51.510 --> 41:55.514
In the early '60s,
he worked almost constantly.

41:56.599 --> 41:59.310
Three hundred sixty two days,
probably.

42:47.149 --> 42:48.589
Thank you,
greetings and Salutations,

42:48.776 --> 42:49.902
ladies and gentlemen.

42:50.110 --> 42:51.445
I'm your emcee, Danny Ray.

42:51.987 --> 42:54.388
I would like to name a few tunes
of the past and the present.

42:54.532 --> 42:57.993
Such tunes as "Try Me",
"Signed, Sealed and Delivered",

42:58.202 --> 43:00.996
"Out Of Sight",
"Papa's Got A Brand New Bag",

43:01.205 --> 43:02.414
"Oh, I Feel Good".

43:03.040 --> 43:05.000
Introducing the King of Soul,

43:05.209 --> 43:07.378
recently has been crowned
as one of the hardest working

43:07.586 --> 43:09.004
entertainers in the world.

43:09.630 --> 43:12.132
The living legend,
the fantastic, Mr. Dynamite,

43:12.341 --> 43:13.551
James Brown!

43:20.057 --> 43:22.268
<i>Once he walked on stage,
the band,</i>

43:22.476 --> 43:25.729
we pay attention to James Brown,
nobody else but him.

43:27.273 --> 43:29.358
<i>You never took your eye
off of him.</i>

43:29.567 --> 43:32.695
<i>Because, see, he had things
that he was doing.</i>

43:41.453 --> 43:44.164
I had to keep the time going
to the music,

43:44.623 --> 43:48.586
but ready at any time
to accent his moves.

43:51.005 --> 43:52.756
Hits,
that's what we would call hits.

43:55.050 --> 43:57.469
<i>He'll make the hits.
We loved to do that, you know.</i>

43:57.678 --> 43:58.679
We would hit with him.

43:58.929 --> 44:02.224
And he would try to trick us,
and we would get him.

44:06.979 --> 44:09.023
<i>If he would see
that you're not watching him,</i>

44:09.231 --> 44:12.443
<i>he would change the song
just like that.</i>

44:12.651 --> 44:15.446
<i>To throw you off,
and then he'll fine you.</i>

44:16.780 --> 44:18.073
He would go like this, you know.

44:18.282 --> 44:20.284
That would be like five, ten,
fifteen, twenty.

44:20.492 --> 44:21.702
He would look at a guy,

44:21.910 --> 44:24.288
and fine them five, fifteen,
twenty dollars like that.

44:31.462 --> 44:33.005
<i>Oh, God, yeah.</i>

44:33.714 --> 44:36.050
<i>That's $30
coming out of your pay.</i>

44:36.258 --> 44:37.676
For what, you don't know.

44:38.844 --> 44:40.724
There's one more thing
I want to say right here.

44:45.517 --> 44:47.936
<i>I guess you can say
James Brown was a tyrant,</i>

44:48.145 --> 44:51.315
maybe because he fought so hard
to learn what he was doing

44:51.523 --> 44:53.442
and learn every aspect
of his business.

44:53.651 --> 44:55.194
He set the bar very, very high.

45:28.268 --> 45:31.522
There was nobody
in the business, period,

45:32.147 --> 45:34.817
<i>that dressed no better
than the James Brown Band.</i>

45:36.527 --> 45:37.528
<i>Oh, man.</i>

45:51.834 --> 45:53.877
<i>He would play seven days a week,</i>

45:54.086 --> 45:56.088
<i>tailor your uniforms
twice a gig,</i>

45:56.296 --> 45:59.925
show up every gig,
pressed, clean.

46:00.259 --> 46:01.339
I don't know how we did it.

46:01.427 --> 46:02.886
I can't even remember
how we did it.

46:05.013 --> 46:07.182
<i>He would look me up and down
and say,</i>

46:07.391 --> 46:08.767
"Miss High...

46:09.685 --> 46:11.562
...that dress has gotten tight."

46:11.770 --> 46:13.772
He was very particular
about what you wore

46:13.981 --> 46:15.274
<i>or how you look.</i>

46:16.400 --> 46:18.944
<i>We had fines if you didn't
have creases in your clothes.</i>

46:19.153 --> 46:21.739
Fines if your shoes
weren't together.

46:21.947 --> 46:24.825
<i>And then it got to where
you had to ride on the bus</i>

46:25.033 --> 46:26.160
<i>in a suit and tie.</i>

46:27.828 --> 46:28.828
<i>As he always said,</i>

46:28.996 --> 46:31.123
"Well, you can't never tell
what might happen.

46:31.331 --> 46:34.585
<i>Somebody might be there,
and you'd be already dressed."</i>

46:36.628 --> 46:38.672
He preached stage decorum.

46:39.506 --> 46:40.591
Punctuality.

46:40.799 --> 46:43.093
<i>Mister this, Mister that. Pride.</i>

46:43.635 --> 46:45.012
<i>It was all positive.</i>

46:46.889 --> 46:48.307
<i>As the years went on, I said,</i>

46:48.515 --> 46:50.726
the Mister thing,
where did that come from?

46:50.934 --> 46:53.604
He said, "Alan,
you got to understand something."

46:53.812 --> 46:55.814
"Where I grew up, when I grew up,"

46:56.607 --> 46:57.858
"I was always Jimmy."

46:59.151 --> 47:00.736
"My name ain't never been Jimmy."

47:00.944 --> 47:02.696
"If they wouldn't call me James,"

47:03.989 --> 47:06.241
"you know they really
weren't going to call me mister."

47:07.242 --> 47:08.744
<i>"But I reached a point"</i>

47:08.952 --> 47:11.246
<i>"where if you were willing
to do business with me,"</i>

47:12.289 --> 47:13.707
<i>"you had to call me mister."</i>

47:13.916 --> 47:17.336
<i>"And the only way to do that
is set the example."</i>

47:18.253 --> 47:21.924
<i>I realized how that really
had contributed</i>

47:22.132 --> 47:24.968
<i>to his relationships
with white people.</i>

47:25.177 --> 47:26.458
<i>Again,
particularly in the South,</i>

47:26.553 --> 47:28.639
<i>who controlled
a lot of the venues.</i>

47:29.181 --> 47:31.141
Business is a part
you've got to adapt yourself to

47:31.225 --> 47:34.102
so you can be prepared
for whatever might come up.

47:34.686 --> 47:37.189
I work with the artists,
and I've...

47:38.440 --> 47:39.525
Forever and ever talking

47:39.733 --> 47:43.320
and trying to get the fellows
to get their business together.

47:52.955 --> 47:54.540
<i>James was in charge</i>

47:54.748 --> 47:57.000
<i>of whatever happened
with his organization.</i>

48:00.337 --> 48:03.006
<i>The manager that he had,
Ben Bart,</i>

48:03.215 --> 48:04.800
<i>it's still was James</i>

48:05.008 --> 48:06.728
that made the decisions
as to what happened.

48:08.428 --> 48:10.806
<i>Because everything
had to come through him.</i>

48:11.890 --> 48:15.394
<i>He saw people like Berry Gordy
and what they were accomplishing</i>

48:15.602 --> 48:17.104
<i>and he wanted to be
a part of that.</i>

48:17.312 --> 48:20.440
He didn't want to just be
that guy who sings and dances.

48:20.649 --> 48:22.651
<i>But then
there was The Ed Sullivan Show.</i>

48:24.444 --> 48:26.989
<i>I was talking
to young Jim Brown,</i>

48:27.197 --> 48:29.199
he was born in Augusta, Georgia.

48:29.408 --> 48:32.160
Where he worked on a farm,
picked cotton

48:32.369 --> 48:36.290
and worked in a coal yard,
and always sang his songs.

48:36.498 --> 48:39.751
So we are delighted
to present James Brown

48:39.960 --> 48:41.086
on our stage on this show.

48:41.295 --> 48:44.464
So let's have a fine welcome
for a very fine talent.

49:05.277 --> 49:06.612
<i>I</i> remember when James Brown

49:06.820 --> 49:09.239
<i>was booked to play Ed Sullivan
for the first time,</i>

49:09.865 --> 49:12.242
<i>black radio was promoting it
like a major event.</i>

49:26.214 --> 49:29.217
<i>Understand when black artists
would come on Ed Sullivan,</i>

49:29.426 --> 49:30.761
<i>they would usually come on</i>

49:30.969 --> 49:34.097
<i>and perform
with Ed Sullivan's house band,</i>

49:34.890 --> 49:36.050
<i>who were excellent musicians.</i>

49:36.183 --> 49:38.393
But you got no soul
out of them at all.

49:43.649 --> 49:44.733
<i>James Brown made it clear</i>

49:44.942 --> 49:47.819
<i>he was coming on one way
and one way only,</i>

49:48.028 --> 49:49.696
<i>and that was with his full band.</i>

49:50.238 --> 49:52.407
So you were going to see
the James Brown Show.

50:21.728 --> 50:22.889
Sullivan was the kind of show

50:23.021 --> 50:25.399
where the whole family sat
in front of the TV on Sunday

50:25.607 --> 50:26.650
<i>and watched together.</i>

50:26.858 --> 50:28.068
<i>So my mom and dad, it's like,</i>

50:28.276 --> 50:30.195
<i>"Oh, that James Brown
you always talk about."</i>

50:37.285 --> 50:40.080
It was like watching something
from outer space for them.

50:44.292 --> 50:47.379
<i>And I imagine white America,
probably their jaws dropped.</i>

50:57.389 --> 50:58.670
<i>The Ed Sullivan Show
was the peak</i>

50:58.765 --> 51:01.351
of American musical
entertainment at that time.

51:08.108 --> 51:09.818
The black community
was very proud

51:10.027 --> 51:12.320
<i>that he would be
on the same show</i>

51:12.529 --> 51:14.531
<i>that presented Elvis
and the Beatles,</i>

51:14.781 --> 51:17.576
<i>and that catapulted him
to a whole new level.</i>

51:25.208 --> 51:27.711
<i>My act was so revolutionary,
they couldn't believe it.</i>

51:28.211 --> 51:30.839
<i>I got so many applause
at the dress rehearsal,</i>

51:31.048 --> 51:33.248
<i>they didn't know if they should
keep the dress rehearsal</i>

51:33.341 --> 51:34.551
<i>or film it again.</i>

51:38.597 --> 51:42.142
<i>I was sure of myself,
I knew what I had.</i>

51:45.145 --> 51:47.022
Fine. Thank you very,
very much.

51:47.230 --> 51:50.317
<i>Singing was the first step to
the real things I wanted to do.</i>

51:53.487 --> 51:55.197
<i>Programs normally seen
at this time</i>

51:55.405 --> 51:56.656
<i>will not be broadcast</i>

51:56.865 --> 52:00.118
<i>in order to bring you
this CBS News Special Report:</i>

52:00.327 --> 52:01.703
<i>The March in Mississippi.</i>

52:02.204 --> 52:04.790
I plan to begin my voter
registration march

52:05.207 --> 52:09.377
into Mississippi on Sunday,
June 5th, 1966,

52:10.212 --> 52:12.881
<i>from the downtown
Memphis Peabody Hotel.</i>

52:13.090 --> 52:14.890
<i>They call it the place
where the Delta begins,</i>

52:15.050 --> 52:17.594
<i>the Mississippi Delta
of rich soil and big plantations</i>

52:17.803 --> 52:20.138
<i>and a population
that is predominantly Negro.</i>

52:20.347 --> 52:22.516
<i>"If I can walk through
Mississippi without harm,"</i>

52:22.724 --> 52:23.975
<i>Meredith told reporters,</i>

52:24.184 --> 52:26.269
<i>"other Negroes
will see that they can, too."</i>

52:26.728 --> 52:28.313
<i>Not everyone
was glad to see him.</i>

52:28.814 --> 52:29.981
<i>Two miles further on,</i>

52:30.190 --> 52:32.651
<i>Meredith was felled
by three shotgun blasts.</i>

52:45.997 --> 52:47.557
<i>From the moment
the civil rights leaders</i>

52:47.624 --> 52:49.501
<i>rushed in to continue
James Meredith's march,</i>

52:49.709 --> 52:50.710
<i>there's been a struggle</i>

52:50.919 --> 52:53.046
<i>to see whose philosophy
would guide the steps.</i>

52:53.755 --> 52:55.257
<i>The moderates or the militants.</i>

52:56.716 --> 52:59.052
<i>- What do you want?
- Freedom!</i>

52:59.261 --> 53:01.304
<i>- When do want it?
- Now!</i>

53:01.513 --> 53:03.807
<i>- How much of it do you want?
- All of it!</i>

53:04.141 --> 53:06.393
<i>- We want Black Power!
- Black Power!</i>

53:06.601 --> 53:08.228
<i>We want Black Power!
What do you want?</i>

53:08.436 --> 53:09.729
<i>Black Power!</i>

53:14.609 --> 53:17.195
<i>As we went down the highway,</i>

53:17.404 --> 53:19.865
we recognized that
we had to overcome our fears.

53:20.407 --> 53:23.702
And we also knew
that we had to challenge

53:23.910 --> 53:26.997
the old tactics and strategies
of the civil rights movement.

53:27.205 --> 53:29.791
<i>It was just too slow
for the younger generation.</i>

53:30.000 --> 53:32.502
<i>We wanted our freedom
and we wanted it then.</i>

53:33.378 --> 53:34.588
<i>Black Power!</i>

53:34.796 --> 53:38.175
<i>- What do you want?
- Black Power!</i>

53:43.555 --> 53:44.931
<i>We had some situations</i>

53:45.140 --> 53:48.685
<i>where they used tear gas
and beat the hell out of people.</i>

53:48.894 --> 53:50.187
<i>But we began to recognize</i>

53:50.395 --> 53:53.064
<i>that we gonna actually make it
to the state capitol</i>

53:53.273 --> 53:55.567
<i>and we said that we needed
a major event.</i>

53:55.775 --> 53:57.194
<i>And who was the better person</i>

53:57.402 --> 54:00.155
<i>to carry the message
we're trying to carry in,</i>

54:00.363 --> 54:03.283
but a soul singer
like James Brown.

54:16.213 --> 54:18.340
<i>Like a lot
of black entertainers,</i>

54:18.548 --> 54:22.093
<i>as the civil rights movement
really begins to pick up steam,</i>

54:22.719 --> 54:24.679
they had to kind of pick a side.

54:26.223 --> 54:29.309
He said, "You got to understand,
I don't believe in non-violence."

54:29.517 --> 54:31.019
"You grew up admiring Dr. King."

54:31.228 --> 54:32.562
<i>"I respected him,"</i>

54:32.771 --> 54:35.440
<i>"but I carried two or three guns
all the time."</i>

54:35.649 --> 54:40.528
<i>"But I wanted to reflect
the fervor of what's going on."</i>

54:46.284 --> 54:49.996
<i>When we flew into Jackson,
they met us out there</i>

54:50.205 --> 54:51.623
<i>and they had the dogs
and the guns.</i>

54:51.831 --> 54:56.628
They surrounded his plane while
we went in to do the concert.

54:58.546 --> 55:02.092
<i>I don't know if I had enough
time to be afraid.</i>

55:02.300 --> 55:03.468
<i>It was touchy.</i>

55:04.177 --> 55:05.470
<i>At Tougaloo College,</i>

55:05.679 --> 55:08.556
<i>just eight miles
outside of Jackson, Mississippi,</i>

55:09.182 --> 55:12.435
<i>Hollywood and Broadway's salute
to the Meredith Marchers.</i>

55:13.144 --> 55:14.396
<i>The program has just started</i>

55:14.604 --> 55:17.857
<i>and on the stage right now,
James Brown.</i>

55:18.108 --> 55:19.442
<i>Let's join him there.</i>

55:21.736 --> 55:24.656
<i>Dr. King and all the other
civil rights leaders</i>

55:24.864 --> 55:27.951
<i>were working out the program
for the next day.</i>

55:28.159 --> 55:30.203
And Dr. King said,
"Look here, you all."

55:30.412 --> 55:32.539
"You all can sit around here and
have this argument if you want to."

55:32.747 --> 55:34.108
"I'm going to go see James Brown."

55:40.630 --> 55:43.341
<i>It was just euphoria
all over the place,</i>

55:43.550 --> 55:46.344
<i>that James Brown is here
with us, you know.</i>

55:46.553 --> 55:50.348
<i>And he said, "Hey, you all,
you marched all the way through"</i>

55:50.557 --> 55:53.727
<i>"and you have fought back
and gave a courageous fight."</i>

55:53.935 --> 55:55.312
He just galvanized the crowd.

56:06.072 --> 56:08.867
<i>We have Dr. Martin Luther King
right before the platform.</i>

56:09.075 --> 56:11.202
<i>Dr. King, what do you think
of this rally tonight?</i>

56:11.411 --> 56:13.621
<i>Oh, it's a marvelous turnout</i>

56:14.581 --> 56:16.291
<i>and I'm happy about the fact</i>

56:16.499 --> 56:19.085
<i>that many of our
outstanding entertainers</i>

56:19.753 --> 56:23.048
<i>have been willing to take time
out of their very busy schedules</i>

56:23.631 --> 56:25.717
<i>to be a part of this struggle.</i>

56:29.804 --> 56:31.389
<i>On that particular occasion,</i>

56:31.598 --> 56:33.725
it was James Brown
that made the difference.

56:34.309 --> 56:37.312
<i>He found a way to fit in
and contribute,</i>

56:37.520 --> 56:38.772
<i>but also to learn a lot</i>

56:38.980 --> 56:42.359
<i>about the people who were trying
to change America.</i>

56:42.567 --> 56:45.987
<i>The James Brown you witnessed,
the rest of this show.</i>

56:46.196 --> 56:48.156
<i>This is Black Power, baby.</i>

56:57.916 --> 56:59.501
<i>"In A Cold Sweat", cut one.</i>

57:29.823 --> 57:30.949
He said...

57:45.088 --> 57:46.423
<i>"In a Cold Sweat", cut two.</i>

58:58.036 --> 59:01.164
<i>By 1967,
when "Cold Sweat" comes out,</i>

59:01.372 --> 59:05.126
now he was officially away
from the rest of the pack.

59:07.170 --> 59:08.796
<i>"Cold Sweat" is a vamp.</i>

59:11.466 --> 59:13.468
<i>But you have
all these different parts.</i>

59:13.676 --> 59:17.138
<i>It was this juxtaposition
of something being tight</i>

59:17.347 --> 59:19.140
<i>but very loose at the same time.</i>

59:19.349 --> 59:21.142
And that's what jazz
really is all about.

59:27.857 --> 59:32.153
Maceo Parker is probably
the most recognizable sound

59:32.362 --> 59:34.280
<i>of the James Brown Band.</i>

59:44.123 --> 59:46.084
<i>When he got to the point
where he start calling my name,</i>

59:46.292 --> 59:48.628
telling me to come out and play,
it was like, "Wow."

59:50.463 --> 59:54.050
<i>When I recognized I could hear
the funky side of stuff,</i>

59:54.259 --> 59:55.760
<i>I said, well, I got to use that</i>

59:55.969 --> 59:57.970
because there is nobody
that can hear it like I do.

01:00:01.224 --> 01:00:02.976
<i>And he appreciated that.</i>

01:00:22.370 --> 01:00:24.289
Now give the drummer some.

01:00:25.790 --> 01:00:27.166
Give the drummer some.

01:00:27.750 --> 01:00:30.169
Give him some! Drummer, you got it!

01:00:30.378 --> 01:00:31.629
<i>Now, Clyde Stubblefield,</i>

01:00:31.838 --> 01:00:34.591
he was almost
like part man, part machine.

01:00:42.682 --> 01:00:44.767
<i>Clyde had all these subtleties,</i>

01:00:44.976 --> 01:00:47.270
this kind of bouncy left hand.

01:00:55.612 --> 01:00:57.697
<i>Music, and especially with soul
and funk music,</i>

01:00:57.905 --> 01:01:01.075
it's based on a very simple
emphasis of the one.

01:01:07.415 --> 01:01:08.499
<i>Now, in gospel music,</i>

01:01:08.708 --> 01:01:10.589
<i>if you played direct rhythm
with the tambourine,</i>

01:01:11.628 --> 01:01:13.838
adding grace notes
is those small notes.

01:01:18.635 --> 01:01:19.875
<i>And that's the sound of church.</i>

01:01:22.055 --> 01:01:25.516
<i>Clyde Stubblefield had perfect
grace notes on his snare.</i>

01:01:29.437 --> 01:01:31.147
<i>I never took lessons.</i>

01:01:32.190 --> 01:01:35.234
Music, to me,
looked like Chinese writing.

01:01:35.485 --> 01:01:38.571
So, I don't know.
I play from my heart and soul.

01:01:50.833 --> 01:01:52.293
<i>That concept of the one,</i>

01:01:52.502 --> 01:01:55.838
it changed the emphasis
from where it had been in jazz.

01:01:56.047 --> 01:01:58.091
In jazz,
it had been on the two and four.

01:02:00.218 --> 01:02:02.095
That's two, four.

01:02:04.263 --> 01:02:05.463
<i>You move into the funk period,</i>

01:02:05.473 --> 01:02:07.433
<i>they change the emphasis
to the one and the three,</i>

01:02:07.475 --> 01:02:09.236
<i>and put it down on the bottom
with the drums,</i>

01:02:09.310 --> 01:02:10.853
to pick you up,
drop you back down.

01:02:54.564 --> 01:02:56.232
Give the band
a big round of applause!

01:03:01.320 --> 01:03:05.241
<i>When I joined the band,
he had "Cold Sweat" as a hit.</i>

01:03:05.450 --> 01:03:08.494
I didn't like it, you know.
I said it's incorrect, you know.

01:03:08.703 --> 01:03:11.664
It's bad, bad musically.

01:03:11.873 --> 01:03:16.586
It had a bridge
that didn't go with the head.

01:03:16.961 --> 01:03:20.548
<i>But I decided to take the job
to get out of the South,</i>

01:03:20.757 --> 01:03:22.175
<i>and go to New York</i>

01:03:22.383 --> 01:03:25.386
<i>and be discovered
as a great jazz trombone player.</i>

01:03:25.595 --> 01:03:28.765
And even though I wasn't crazy
about these songs,

01:03:29.015 --> 01:03:30.255
I knew that they were different

01:03:30.433 --> 01:03:33.478
from the ordinary rhythm
and blues that was happening.

01:03:33.686 --> 01:03:36.105
And the band performed them
real good.

01:03:43.488 --> 01:03:47.408
The thing about performing live
is there's this energy going on

01:03:47.617 --> 01:03:50.787
<i>between the musicians
and the audience.</i>

01:03:50.995 --> 01:03:52.830
<i>You don't get that
in a recording studio.</i>

01:03:53.039 --> 01:03:55.708
<i>That doesn't mean you can't make
great music in a studio.</i>

01:03:55.917 --> 01:03:58.294
<i>You just have to have
a different discipline.</i>

01:03:58.503 --> 01:04:01.005
<i>I think Mr. Brown's
studio recordings</i>

01:04:01.214 --> 01:04:04.425
are somehow just live shows
with no audience there.

01:04:17.188 --> 01:04:21.984
James always had to work himself
into what you were recording.

01:04:22.193 --> 01:04:24.111
<i>You used to hate to do that.</i>

01:04:24.320 --> 01:04:27.990
You'd go from this time of day
till next day almost.

01:04:29.617 --> 01:04:31.202
<i>He would come in and say,
"Wait a minute, Jab.</i>

01:04:31.410 --> 01:04:32.954
<i>Let me show you
how I want it to go."</i>

01:04:34.497 --> 01:04:35.748
So I'm, okay.

01:04:35.957 --> 01:04:38.459
And he would get up, you know,
and he'd sit there

01:04:38.668 --> 01:04:40.711
and whatever it was
he was doing.

01:04:40.920 --> 01:04:43.464
And he said, "You got it?"
And I would say, yeah.

01:04:43.673 --> 01:04:46.717
So I would go back and play
what I already was playing.

01:04:46.926 --> 01:04:48.553
"That's it, you got it."

01:04:49.595 --> 01:04:52.181
<i>And you just laugh to yourself
and keep going.</i>

01:04:54.267 --> 01:04:55.893
<i>James is not trained at all.</i>

01:04:56.102 --> 01:04:57.728
Which makes it difficult

01:04:57.937 --> 01:05:00.273
to understand
what he's talking about.

01:05:06.737 --> 01:05:09.824
<i>He knows that he's working
with musicians</i>

01:05:10.032 --> 01:05:12.577
<i>who are the best
at what they do.</i>

01:05:12.785 --> 01:05:14.036
<i>He doesn't care.</i>

01:05:14.787 --> 01:05:17.164
<i>He's like, "Look,
I know you can read music."</i>

01:05:17.915 --> 01:05:19.250
<i>"I can't do any of that."</i>

01:05:19.458 --> 01:05:21.961
<i>"But you still got to follow me
because I'm the man."</i>

01:05:28.759 --> 01:05:30.887
Part Two of "Get it Together",

01:05:31.095 --> 01:05:34.765
they're having an open rehearsal
right in the middle of the song.

01:05:41.981 --> 01:05:43.900
I'm thinking,
he left this on the record?

01:05:44.108 --> 01:05:45.401
This is brilliant.

01:05:45.651 --> 01:05:47.528
"Engineer, I got to go.
Fade it out."

01:05:49.155 --> 01:05:50.781
You don't say that
on the record.

01:05:51.824 --> 01:05:53.409
I was like, man, this is raw.

01:06:03.252 --> 01:06:05.588
When he get through
in the recording studio,

01:06:05.796 --> 01:06:07.757
<i>they would print up his records
right there,</i>

01:06:07.965 --> 01:06:09.467
<i>next door, in King Studio.</i>

01:06:09.884 --> 01:06:11.969
<i>So everything
was coming out in a day.</i>

01:06:12.178 --> 01:06:15.139
Didn't take no week or nothing,
just right there.

01:06:15.348 --> 01:06:19.685
<i>He owned King Studio,
not money-wise, but talent-wise.</i>

01:06:19.894 --> 01:06:23.272
<i>There was no other artist
who had that kind of control</i>

01:06:23.481 --> 01:06:25.691
<i>or those kinds of resources.</i>

01:06:26.025 --> 01:06:29.695
<i>At that time, his manager,
Ben Bart passed away in 1968.</i>

01:06:30.321 --> 01:06:33.157
From that point on, James Brown
was essentially self-managed.

01:06:33.741 --> 01:06:37.662
<i>All he talked about was,
how much money he could make</i>

01:06:37.870 --> 01:06:38.996
<i>and how big he was.</i>

01:06:39.330 --> 01:06:40.915
<i>Sometimes we'd
start a conversation</i>

01:06:41.123 --> 01:06:42.708
<i>about football or baseball,</i>

01:06:42.917 --> 01:06:46.671
but he'd always get right back
to what song we were going to do

01:06:46.879 --> 01:06:49.298
<i>and who messed up
and stuff like that.</i>

01:06:49.507 --> 01:06:50.883
He never partied with the band.

01:06:51.092 --> 01:06:53.052
<i>It was not a business with us.</i>

01:06:53.260 --> 01:06:54.887
<i>He was mainly
with his girlfriends,</i>

01:06:55.096 --> 01:06:59.266
and once in a blue moon
he might ride the bus.

01:06:59.850 --> 01:07:02.061
<i>He didn't have any friends,
no close friends.</i>

01:07:02.269 --> 01:07:04.063
<i>He had to force people
to be around him.</i>

01:07:05.147 --> 01:07:06.565
I think he was lonely.

01:07:07.858 --> 01:07:09.110
<i>He grew up with a sense</i>

01:07:09.318 --> 01:07:11.529
<i>that you really
can't trust anybody.</i>

01:07:11.737 --> 01:07:15.074
This is a guy who basically
was taught at a very early age

01:07:15.282 --> 01:07:16.993
you can't trust your mother.

01:07:17.201 --> 01:07:19.495
Not to say you didn't love her,
but you can't trust her.

01:07:20.913 --> 01:07:22.123
Because she's gone.

01:07:23.374 --> 01:07:26.002
<i>He was absolutely haunted
by that.</i>

01:07:27.003 --> 01:07:29.755
<i>I remember one night we were
riding around and I told him,</i>

01:07:29.964 --> 01:07:33.134
I come out of a broken home,
my father left.

01:07:33.342 --> 01:07:35.469
He looked at me and said,
"Your father left?"

01:07:35.678 --> 01:07:37.805
"My mother and father left me."

01:07:38.014 --> 01:07:41.308
<i>"My father gave me to my aunt.
I was raised in a whore house."</i>

01:07:41.851 --> 01:07:44.353
<i>He said,
"I'd watch the church women come"</i>

01:07:44.562 --> 01:07:46.480
"and turn tricks all day
and leave at 4:30"

01:07:46.689 --> 01:07:48.569
"so they could be home
to cook for their husbands"

01:07:48.607 --> 01:07:50.568
"and they didn't know
that they were prostitutes."

01:07:51.360 --> 01:07:54.780
<i>To grow up like that, it's hard
for you to trust anybody.</i>

01:07:54.989 --> 01:07:57.241
<i>I think it also
was why he was a loner.</i>

01:07:57.450 --> 01:08:01.495
<i>And once he came of age,
he could never shake that.</i>

01:08:04.623 --> 01:08:06.667
<i>We were in Sacramento
and we performed,</i>

01:08:06.876 --> 01:08:09.378
<i>and he left without making sure</i>

01:08:09.670 --> 01:08:13.132
<i>that the bus could get us back
to the East Coast.</i>

01:08:13.340 --> 01:08:14.925
We basically quit.

01:08:15.134 --> 01:08:17.094
Eventually everybody
came back to him

01:08:17.344 --> 01:08:19.055
but he was angry about it.

01:08:19.263 --> 01:08:22.475
He would remind them, you know,
"You left me, you left me.

01:08:22.683 --> 01:08:26.437
And I don't trust you
because you left me."

01:08:27.313 --> 01:08:30.066
And I think
that was one of his reasons too

01:08:30.274 --> 01:08:34.194
of not really getting close
to anyone in the band.

01:08:34.528 --> 01:08:37.531
Didn't matter where I was.
I was always strapped.

01:08:38.115 --> 01:08:40.076
<i>Because sometimes
James had good days,</i>

01:08:40.283 --> 01:08:41.577
<i>sometimes he had bad days.</i>

01:08:42.203 --> 01:08:43.912
<i>I didn't want to be a part
of the bad days.</i>

01:08:45.038 --> 01:08:48.834
<i>We're in Minneapolis, Minnesota,
I can't forget that.</i>

01:08:49.042 --> 01:08:50.643
<i>Gertrude Saunders,
the wardrobe mistress,</i>

01:08:50.795 --> 01:08:53.130
<i>comes down, said,
"Hey, Melvin, Maceo.</i>

01:08:53.631 --> 01:08:55.758
<i>He wants you guys up
to the dressing room right now."</i>

01:08:56.425 --> 01:09:00.054
As we walked in the door,
Tony Walker, the henchman,

01:09:00.261 --> 01:09:03.349
is strapping on his .45.

01:09:04.390 --> 01:09:06.894
<i>James is doing his hair
and looking in the mirror.</i>

01:09:07.394 --> 01:09:13.984
He says, "Maceo, they tell me
you picking at me on the bus."

01:09:14.819 --> 01:09:15.819
He put the comb down,

01:09:16.028 --> 01:09:17.988
and he stood up
and turned around,

01:09:18.197 --> 01:09:19.907
started to walk toward us.

01:09:20.116 --> 01:09:24.620
He said, "When we come for you,
you better be ready."

01:09:24.828 --> 01:09:27.206
I could see with that left hand,

01:09:27.413 --> 01:09:30.334
he was getting ready
to punch Maceo in the mouth

01:09:30.542 --> 01:09:31.863
so that he couldn't play
his horn.

01:09:33.170 --> 01:09:35.171
I pushed Maceo to the side,

01:09:35.381 --> 01:09:39.051
went in my pocket
at the same time, pulled it out.

01:09:39.260 --> 01:09:40.970
When you have that automatic,

01:09:41.178 --> 01:09:43.346
you always keep one
in the chamber.

01:09:44.140 --> 01:09:45.140
Pump it.

01:09:46.267 --> 01:09:49.645
Let him know that it's loaded.

01:09:49.854 --> 01:09:52.982
When I hit it, the .32 shell
went up in the air,

01:09:53.189 --> 01:09:55.484
came down,
seems as if it was slow motion.

01:09:56.193 --> 01:09:58.863
And when it landed on the floor,
it hit, boom, boom, boom.

01:09:59.071 --> 01:10:03.242
I stuck it right in his nose,
and I said, "I'm ready now."

01:10:03.534 --> 01:10:05.655
"What do you want to do?
What do you want to do, huh?"

01:10:05.786 --> 01:10:06.912
"What do you want to do?"

01:10:07.121 --> 01:10:08.581
He put his hands up and said,
"No, no, no, no, no!

01:10:08.789 --> 01:10:11.458
I didn't mean that!
Not like that! Not like that!"

01:10:11.667 --> 01:10:15.504
I said, "you don't come for me.
You don't come for my brother."

01:10:16.505 --> 01:10:17.715
And that was that.

01:10:18.424 --> 01:10:20.259
You had to approach him
with strength.

01:10:20.467 --> 01:10:21.719
You had to always be a man.

01:10:21.927 --> 01:10:23.721
And I really loved the guy.

01:10:24.680 --> 01:10:27.474
But I could never say to him,
"Hey, man, I love you, man."

01:10:27.683 --> 01:10:30.102
Because he had a way
of taking advantage of that,

01:10:30.311 --> 01:10:31.937
<i>or taking that for weakness.</i>

01:10:33.606 --> 01:10:36.066
<i>With men,
he isn't that super tough guy.</i>

01:10:36.275 --> 01:10:38.194
He wants to be. He is not.

01:10:38.402 --> 01:10:40.196
<i>He is with women.</i>

01:10:40.613 --> 01:10:43.157
<i>Brown would be a super tough guy
with women.</i>

01:10:43.365 --> 01:10:47.036
And the women do what he want,
when he want, so...

01:10:47.244 --> 01:10:51.790
I do remember
the lady that he was dating

01:10:51.999 --> 01:10:53.751
when I first joined him.

01:10:53.959 --> 01:10:56.295
She only focused on him.

01:10:56.503 --> 01:11:00.299
She would never turn
and look at anyone.

01:11:00.507 --> 01:11:05.930
Not unless he said, "Baby, look.
You know, there's the Jewels."

01:11:06.138 --> 01:11:08.349
And then she'll turn around,
"Hello."

01:11:08.557 --> 01:11:12.645
He was very jealous.
He was a very jealous man.

01:11:12.853 --> 01:11:17.483
But I don't think that any woman
deserves to be beaten.

01:11:18.150 --> 01:11:21.278
<i>I know he was arrested
for domestic violence,</i>

01:11:21.487 --> 01:11:22.947
<i>and he has told me he hit women.</i>

01:11:23.155 --> 01:11:26.242
I remember he got into one fight
that I was in the hotel.

01:11:26.450 --> 01:11:27.993
I walked him out of the room.

01:11:28.202 --> 01:11:30.162
When I came in,
they obviously been fighting.

01:11:30.371 --> 01:11:32.206
And we went down
and sat by the pool,

01:11:32.414 --> 01:11:34.208
and he looked at me,
he said, "Reverend."

01:11:34.541 --> 01:11:36.961
He said, "Don't ever hit a
woman. Don't be like me."

01:11:37.169 --> 01:11:39.421
He said, "I come from
generations of that."

01:11:39.630 --> 01:11:40.631
"It's wrong."

01:12:00.901 --> 01:12:04.780
<i>Pillage, looting,
murder and arson</i>

01:12:05.364 --> 01:12:07.283
<i>have nothing to do
with civil rights.</i>

01:12:08.200 --> 01:12:10.995
<i>They are criminal conduct</i>

01:12:11.203 --> 01:12:14.039
<i>and the federal government
has no alternative</i>

01:12:14.248 --> 01:12:15.791
<i>but to respond.</i>

01:12:23.465 --> 01:12:28.012
<i>I think we've got to see a riot
is a language of the unheard,</i>

01:12:28.220 --> 01:12:31.140
<i>and what is it that America
has failed to hear?</i>

01:12:31.348 --> 01:12:32.349
<i>It has failed to hear</i>

01:12:32.558 --> 01:12:38.397
<i>that the economic plight
of the Negro poor has worsened.</i>

01:12:43.193 --> 01:12:46.947
<i>We've got to turn our backs
on this country.</i>

01:12:47.156 --> 01:12:50.284
<i>This country has never cared
about black people.</i>

01:12:53.370 --> 01:12:56.373
<i>Soul is when a man
has to struggle all his life</i>

01:12:56.582 --> 01:12:57.958
<i>to be equal to another man.</i>

01:12:58.167 --> 01:13:01.712
Soul is when a man pays taxes
and still he comes up second.

01:13:02.421 --> 01:13:05.507
<i>Soul is when</i> a <i>man is judged
not by what they do,</i>

01:13:05.716 --> 01:13:07.217
<i>but what color they are.</i>

01:13:11.847 --> 01:13:15.559
<i>The rebellions that we see
are merely dress rehearsals</i>

01:13:15.768 --> 01:13:17.088
<i>for the revolution
that's to come.</i>

01:13:19.355 --> 01:13:21.565
<i>We've got some difficult days ahead,</i>

01:13:22.191 --> 01:13:24.693
<i>but I want you to know tonight</i>

01:13:24.943 --> 01:13:28.947
<i>that we, as a people,
will get to the Promised Land.</i>

01:13:51.178 --> 01:13:52.554
<i>At 7:10 this evening,</i>

01:13:52.763 --> 01:13:55.891
<i>Martin Luther King
was shot in Tennessee.</i>

01:13:56.600 --> 01:13:59.686
<i>Martin Luther King,
20 minutes ago, died.</i>

01:14:13.992 --> 01:14:15.702
<i>Probably the most important show</i>

01:14:15.869 --> 01:14:19.498
<i>of James Brown's career
is April 1968.</i>

01:14:19.706 --> 01:14:22.459
Martin Luther King
had just been assassinated,

01:14:23.460 --> 01:14:26.797
<i>and all of America
is erupting in violence.</i>

01:14:33.887 --> 01:14:35.097
<i>We were on the way to Boston</i>

01:14:35.305 --> 01:14:36.849
<i>and we didn't know
if the show was going to happen.</i>

01:14:37.057 --> 01:14:40.727
<i>We knew that Dr. King was shot.
He was dead.</i>

01:14:40.936 --> 01:14:43.564
And we didn't know
what that meant for us.

01:14:43.772 --> 01:14:47.192
The band was kind of fearful.

01:14:47.401 --> 01:14:51.196
<i>The Mayor didn't want James
to come there and do that show.</i>

01:14:51.447 --> 01:14:54.867
<i>But that city councilman
told him upfront.</i>

01:14:55.242 --> 01:14:57.327
<i>If you don't let him
do that show,</i>

01:14:57.536 --> 01:15:00.831
they are going to burn this
city down, and he was serious.

01:15:01.039 --> 01:15:04.543
They were poised
to do just that.

01:15:12.843 --> 01:15:14.928
<i>I think there's reason
for apprehension</i>

01:15:15.137 --> 01:15:16.137
<i>but not a lot.</i>

01:15:16.305 --> 01:15:17.306
<i>Boston has great hope</i>

01:15:17.514 --> 01:15:20.142
and we are a mature,
patient community

01:15:20.350 --> 01:15:23.687
and I hope
we're going to weather this.

01:15:23.896 --> 01:15:28.108
Tonight you've turned the Brown
concert into a memorial service.

01:15:28.317 --> 01:15:29.943
We're going to broadcast that live

01:15:30.152 --> 01:15:32.196
and I assume you feel that

01:15:32.404 --> 01:15:36.074
that will have an effect
in the community.

01:15:36.283 --> 01:15:39.411
Well, I'm hoping it's one valve
that will let off some steam

01:15:39.620 --> 01:15:41.705
and I think it's
an appropriate place to have it

01:15:41.914 --> 01:15:45.042
because it's
a peaceful gathering

01:15:45.250 --> 01:15:47.628
and that's synonymous
with everything that King did.

01:16:10.692 --> 01:16:12.402
Thank you very much,
ladies and gentlemen.

01:16:14.029 --> 01:16:16.365
I want to say thanks
for coming out to see the show

01:16:17.241 --> 01:16:20.160
and you've made it possible
for me

01:16:20.369 --> 01:16:23.789
to be a first class man
in all respects.

01:16:24.498 --> 01:16:26.083
Thank you.

01:16:27.543 --> 01:16:29.503
In Augusta, Georgia,
I used to shine shoes

01:16:29.711 --> 01:16:33.173
on the steps of a...
Thank you.

01:16:33.382 --> 01:16:35.801
In front of a radio station
called "WRDW."

01:16:36.718 --> 01:16:38.519
I used to shine shoes
in front of that station

01:16:38.554 --> 01:16:39.972
and I think we started off...

01:16:40.180 --> 01:16:41.890
I used to get three cents,
then up to five cents,

01:16:42.099 --> 01:16:43.976
then finally,
I got to six cents.

01:16:46.019 --> 01:16:48.522
But now, I own that station.

01:16:51.858 --> 01:16:53.068
You know what that is?

01:16:54.611 --> 01:16:55.946
That's black power.

01:17:11.795 --> 01:17:14.089
<i>When we did the show,
we were hurt</i>

01:17:14.298 --> 01:17:15.658
but you didn't think
about anything

01:17:15.757 --> 01:17:17.801
but doing that show at the time.

01:18:01.428 --> 01:18:02.679
Wait a minute.

01:18:03.722 --> 01:18:05.932
Move off.
I'll be all right, I'll be fine.

01:18:06.975 --> 01:18:08.894
I'm all right, I'm all right.

01:18:10.896 --> 01:18:12.898
I'm all right, I'm all right.

01:18:15.651 --> 01:18:17.444
You want to dance?
Dance.

01:18:17.653 --> 01:18:22.282
<i>People started rushing the stage
and we weren't playing no more</i>

01:18:22.491 --> 01:18:23.909
<i>but they came on, getting ready</i>

01:18:24.117 --> 01:18:25.994
and trying to come all up
on the stage

01:18:26.203 --> 01:18:29.039
and the police was pushing them,

01:18:29.247 --> 01:18:31.708
the guards and everything
was pushing them off the stage

01:18:31.917 --> 01:18:34.336
and Brown says,
"Hold it, hold it, hold it."

01:18:34.544 --> 01:18:35.587
Wait a minute, wait a minute,
wait a minute,

01:18:35.796 --> 01:18:36.797
they all right. It's all right.

01:18:37.005 --> 01:18:38.715
That's all right,
that's all right.

01:18:46.098 --> 01:18:47.224
Now look,
wait a minute, wait a minute.

01:18:47.432 --> 01:18:48.767
Let me finish the show,
now wait a minute,

01:18:48.975 --> 01:18:50.185
let me finish the show
for everybody else.

01:18:50.394 --> 01:18:52.114
<i>I didn't know what to say
about that myself.</i>

01:18:52.312 --> 01:18:53.980
I'm sitting there on the drums
still just waiting, you know,

01:18:54.189 --> 01:18:55.649
like, wow, what's going on?

01:18:55.857 --> 01:18:58.819
This is no way.
We are black, we are black!

01:18:59.986 --> 01:19:01.071
Now wait a minute,

01:19:01.279 --> 01:19:02.364
can't you all brother
get down from there

01:19:02.572 --> 01:19:03.865
and let's do this show together.

01:19:04.074 --> 01:19:05.675
We are black,
don't make us all look bad,

01:19:05.742 --> 01:19:07.035
let me finish doing the show.

01:19:07.244 --> 01:19:09.538
Get off the stage,
step down there.

01:19:10.497 --> 01:19:12.624
Let's represent our own selves.
Now step down.

01:19:12.833 --> 01:19:14.292
No, no, that's not right.

01:19:15.001 --> 01:19:16.670
You're not being fair
to yourselves or me, either.

01:19:16.878 --> 01:19:19.506
You're not being fair
to yourself or me or your race.

01:19:20.966 --> 01:19:22.092
Now I asked the police
to step back

01:19:22.300 --> 01:19:25.220
because I think I can get
some respect from my own people.

01:19:25.846 --> 01:19:26.972
It don't make sense.

01:19:27.180 --> 01:19:29.015
Now are we together or we ain't?

01:19:32.185 --> 01:19:33.353
Hit the thing, man.

01:19:37.357 --> 01:19:38.608
I was like, oh, my God.

01:19:38.900 --> 01:19:41.278
You did not just stop the show,

01:19:42.195 --> 01:19:43.822
told people off, then went like

01:19:44.030 --> 01:19:46.575
"All right,
let's get it together. Hit it."

01:19:50.370 --> 01:19:52.091
<i>If I were in the band,
I would've been like,</i>

01:19:52.164 --> 01:19:54.416
Uhh, that's my cue, goodbye.
See you.

01:19:55.375 --> 01:19:56.501
There's like a riot
about to break out.

01:19:56.710 --> 01:19:57.878
<i>I'm out, James.</i>

01:19:59.629 --> 01:20:03.675
Oh, God, he handled that crowd
like he was the King

01:20:03.884 --> 01:20:05.302
and they respected him.

01:20:08.555 --> 01:20:09.681
<i>He cleared them up</i>

01:20:09.890 --> 01:20:12.392
<i>and there wasn't
no more fighting or nothing.</i>

01:20:12.601 --> 01:20:14.281
<i>It could have been
a turnout of that place.</i>

01:20:15.395 --> 01:20:17.022
He was damn good.

01:20:21.318 --> 01:20:22.778
<i>Boston was one of the few cities</i>

01:20:22.986 --> 01:20:26.865
<i>that avoided any sort
of a fire retaliation</i>

01:20:27.073 --> 01:20:29.826
<i>in the inner cities.
Everyone stayed calm.</i>

01:20:30.035 --> 01:20:31.787
<i>Trouble was very minimal.</i>

01:20:39.586 --> 01:20:40.946
We'd like to announce
that the city

01:20:41.046 --> 01:20:43.548
is very quiet and calm,

01:20:43.757 --> 01:20:44.966
and the report also states

01:20:45.175 --> 01:20:48.637
that everyone is home
watching the TV program.

01:20:48.845 --> 01:20:50.430
So I think the fact

01:20:50.639 --> 01:20:53.391
that we do have
the television cameras here,

01:20:54.601 --> 01:20:56.812
I think it was a big success.

01:20:58.939 --> 01:21:00.148
<i>I wanted to see people
get off the streets,</i>

01:21:00.357 --> 01:21:01.566
<i>I wanted them to calm down,</i>

01:21:01.775 --> 01:21:03.652
<i>I didn't want to see
no more bloodshed</i>

01:21:03.860 --> 01:21:04.986
<i>and lives lost.</i>

01:21:05.987 --> 01:21:08.740
<i>But yet, still,
I shared in the same convictions</i>

01:21:08.949 --> 01:21:10.069
<i>of the people on the streets</i>

01:21:10.116 --> 01:21:12.828
<i>because I understood
what they were fighting for.</i>

01:21:15.789 --> 01:21:18.208
<i>Around the country,
I've been doing a lot of things,</i>

01:21:18.416 --> 01:21:20.585
<i>I guess
I'm real concerned about people.</i>

01:21:20.794 --> 01:21:22.879
<i>Overlooking the city,
overlooking Harlem,</i>

01:21:23.088 --> 01:21:25.549
<i>I've seen
all the torn buildings,</i>

01:21:25.757 --> 01:21:28.134
<i>buildings that still standing
that should be removed</i>

01:21:28.343 --> 01:21:30.095
<i>and you know who lives there?</i>

01:21:31.221 --> 01:21:32.222
<i>The black people.</i>

01:21:33.390 --> 01:21:34.933
<i>You know, in Washington,</i>

01:21:35.267 --> 01:21:37.936
<i>houses that we were walking
in front of, condemned,</i>

01:21:38.144 --> 01:21:40.689
<i>and no one can be living
in these houses.</i>

01:21:40.897 --> 01:21:42.566
<i>I went to Watts,</i>

01:21:42.774 --> 01:21:44.415
<i>I found a lot of people
staying in an area</i>

01:21:44.442 --> 01:21:46.695
<i>that didn't have nothing
to offer.</i>

01:21:47.320 --> 01:21:48.864
<i>I went from black America</i>

01:21:49.072 --> 01:21:50.713
<i>and I started talking
to the white America</i>

01:21:50.866 --> 01:21:51.866
<i>and I was saying,</i>

01:21:52.033 --> 01:21:53.634
<i>these are the things
that has to be done,</i>

01:21:53.743 --> 01:21:56.371
<i>we need education worse
than any other race.</i>

01:21:56.830 --> 01:21:59.666
<i>We got to go to the people
that are not even surviving.</i>

01:21:59.875 --> 01:22:01.793
<i>My fight is just starting.</i>

01:22:02.002 --> 01:22:07.382
<i>My fight is against the past,
the old colored man.</i>

01:22:07.591 --> 01:22:09.009
<i>My fight now</i>

01:22:09.217 --> 01:22:13.513
<i>is for the black America
become American.</i>

01:22:29.821 --> 01:22:30.821
Here he comes.

01:22:30.989 --> 01:22:33.366
James.
Come here, James.

01:22:34.951 --> 01:22:35.952
Come here.

01:22:38.622 --> 01:22:40.248
He's my friend.

01:22:44.461 --> 01:22:46.296
First, I would like
to say good morning.

01:22:47.797 --> 01:22:48.798
I want to say this:

01:22:49.007 --> 01:22:50.342
We would like to know sometimes

01:22:50.550 --> 01:22:52.151
what's going to be done
for black people.

01:22:52.344 --> 01:22:54.262
The black man wants ownership.

01:22:55.388 --> 01:22:56.989
He wants to be able
to own his own things

01:22:57.057 --> 01:22:59.017
and make up his own mind.

01:22:59.351 --> 01:23:01.770
Number one
in the black community,

01:23:01.978 --> 01:23:04.481
the lower income areas,
we need housing,

01:23:04.689 --> 01:23:06.358
so we don't have to stay
in the dump,

01:23:06.566 --> 01:23:08.193
like I've stayed in
when I was a kid.

01:23:08.401 --> 01:23:09.611
We need our own banks

01:23:09.819 --> 01:23:12.656
so we can get some money
to do things by ourselves.

01:23:13.239 --> 01:23:14.324
We don't want nobody
to do it for us,

01:23:14.532 --> 01:23:15.742
we want to do it by ourselves.

01:23:15.951 --> 01:23:18.745
Now the candidate that gives me
those kind of things,

01:23:18.954 --> 01:23:20.622
that's the man I endorse.

01:23:21.414 --> 01:23:24.334
I don't endorse the party,
I endorse the man.

01:23:38.932 --> 01:23:41.601
<i>- So good.
- So good.</i>

01:23:53.905 --> 01:23:55.746
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to Black Dignity.</i>

01:23:55.907 --> 01:24:00.453
This Sunday afternoon will be
our most spectacular program.

01:24:00.662 --> 01:24:03.999
This is not only
Soul Brother Number One,

01:24:04.207 --> 01:24:05.375
and rhythm and blues

01:24:05.583 --> 01:24:07.085
but there is no man in our race

01:24:07.293 --> 01:24:09.170
who has gone
as far as he's gone.

01:24:09.379 --> 01:24:12.882
Welcome James Brown
to Black Dignity.

01:24:13.091 --> 01:24:14.426
Thank you, brother Don.

01:24:16.970 --> 01:24:18.513
All right, we are ready to go
for some calls,

01:24:18.722 --> 01:24:20.724
and, ask whatever you want.

01:24:20.932 --> 01:24:22.559
Hello, this is Don Warden,
you are on Black Dignity.

01:24:22.767 --> 01:24:24.978
<i>- What's happening, James?
- How you feel, brother?</i>

01:24:25.186 --> 01:24:27.605
<i>All right. Well, I just want
to ask you one question.</i>

01:24:27.814 --> 01:24:29.858
<i>I would like to know
why you got your process cut?</i>

01:24:30.692 --> 01:24:32.235
Well, this is a black move

01:24:32.444 --> 01:24:34.779
and regardless
of what you are thinking,

01:24:34.988 --> 01:24:36.197
we all got to think one way

01:24:36.406 --> 01:24:38.087
and when we look alike,
we can think alike.

01:24:38.241 --> 01:24:39.576
<i>You know, the way I see it,</i>

01:24:39.784 --> 01:24:41.202
<i>it's really what's in the mind
that counts.</i>

01:24:41.411 --> 01:24:42.412
Well, the mind counts,

01:24:42.620 --> 01:24:46.583
but see,
we all don't have a good image

01:24:46.791 --> 01:24:48.168
and the image is like, black.

01:24:48.376 --> 01:24:49.696
See,
we've never thought together.

01:24:49.836 --> 01:24:51.463
You know, in Africa,
a man can do what he want to do

01:24:51.671 --> 01:24:52.922
because he know who he is.

01:24:53.131 --> 01:24:54.257
Over here, you don't know.

01:24:54.466 --> 01:24:56.760
So first, we got to get
our image, our identity.

01:25:02.557 --> 01:25:05.268
Everybody thought
when James Brown cut his hair

01:25:05.477 --> 01:25:06.686
and went natural, that was it,

01:25:06.895 --> 01:25:08.897
<i>that was the height
of the black power era.</i>

01:25:14.402 --> 01:25:15.763
<i>James Brown was known
for his hair,</i>

01:25:15.820 --> 01:25:20.492
<i>he was absolutely fascinated
with the "Conk" as we called it.</i>

01:25:20.700 --> 01:25:22.327
<i>And for him to give it up</i>

01:25:22.535 --> 01:25:24.537
was to show
he ultimately did feel

01:25:24.746 --> 01:25:27.540
that blacks needed
to learn their natural pride.

01:25:28.333 --> 01:25:30.585
Hello, this is Don Warden,
you're on Black Dignity.

01:25:30.794 --> 01:25:32.212
<i>I wanted to tell you
that I'm glad you got rid</i>

01:25:32.420 --> 01:25:33.741
<i>of that stuff you had
in your hair</i>

01:25:33.797 --> 01:25:36.674
<i>and I wish everybody
would wear a natural</i>

01:25:36.883 --> 01:25:38.968
<i>and be what they are
supposed to be.</i>

01:25:39.177 --> 01:25:41.805
How are you going to get respect?
I'm black and proud.

01:26:06.788 --> 01:26:08.540
<i>He told me,
"I was in Los Angeles"</i>

01:26:08.748 --> 01:26:10.188
"and there was
all this in-fighting,"

01:26:10.375 --> 01:26:11.626
"this crime and all,"

01:26:11.835 --> 01:26:13.044
and he said that "I looked"

01:26:13.253 --> 01:26:15.713
"and I said to myself,
we've lost our pride."

01:26:15.922 --> 01:26:18.216
<i>He said, "I went to my room"</i>

01:26:18.424 --> 01:26:20.927
<i>"and I sat down and started
writing on a napkin."</i>

01:26:22.637 --> 01:26:25.390
<i>On the spur of the moment,
it became a song</i>

01:26:25.598 --> 01:26:28.518
<i>that literally changed
the social dynamics</i>

01:26:28.726 --> 01:26:29.894
<i>of the United States.</i>

01:26:53.001 --> 01:26:56.254
Mr. Brown is Number One
Soul Brother United States.

01:26:56.462 --> 01:26:58.339
He's black and he's proud.

01:26:58.548 --> 01:27:01.176
- He brings out the good in me.
- He's like the preacher.

01:27:05.513 --> 01:27:07.265
<i>First thing,
a man has to be a man</i>

01:27:07.473 --> 01:27:09.142
<i>and when we say, "Negro,"</i>

01:27:09.434 --> 01:27:11.194
this is a term that's been used
so many times

01:27:11.352 --> 01:27:13.479
but I don't particularly care
for that term.

01:27:13.688 --> 01:27:15.773
I'd rather be a black man
because that's identity.

01:27:16.774 --> 01:27:19.194
<i>A black man is a man
who want to pay his own way,</i>

01:27:19.402 --> 01:27:20.737
<i>who want to earn his own keep,</i>

01:27:20.945 --> 01:27:22.447
<i>a man that stands up among men.</i>

01:27:22.864 --> 01:27:24.199
<i>You see, when you stand up
in the States</i>

01:27:24.407 --> 01:27:27.243
<i>they say you're a militant
but I say you're a man.</i>

01:27:32.415 --> 01:27:33.666
As an eight-year-old

01:27:33.958 --> 01:27:36.038
"Say It Loud I'm Black
And I'm Proud" was very clear.

01:27:36.211 --> 01:27:39.422
<i>I remember defining myself
as these American terms</i>

01:27:39.631 --> 01:27:42.258
<i>of Negro to colored to black.</i>

01:27:42.467 --> 01:27:44.886
<i>Because of that one song,
black was beautiful,</i>

01:27:45.094 --> 01:27:46.429
the beginning
of being beautiful.

01:27:48.139 --> 01:27:50.808
<i>I was 13
and it was revolutionary,</i>

01:27:51.017 --> 01:27:54.604
<i>because not only did some whites
look down us,</i>

01:27:54.812 --> 01:27:56.213
there were many
light-skinned blacks

01:27:56.397 --> 01:27:58.608
that looked down
on dark-skinned blacks.

01:27:58.816 --> 01:28:00.235
And overnight,

01:28:00.443 --> 01:28:02.904
dark-skinned girls
became the thing you wanted.

01:28:03.154 --> 01:28:06.532
<i>Overnight, James Brown changed
our whole teenaged life.</i>

01:28:16.668 --> 01:28:19.295
<i>There was fear he had alienated
his white audience</i>

01:28:19.504 --> 01:28:20.865
and white people began
to be afraid

01:28:21.005 --> 01:28:22.131
to come to the shows.

01:28:22.340 --> 01:28:23.861
I don't think
that was his plan at all.

01:28:24.008 --> 01:28:25.260
<i>Brown's whole sound</i>

01:28:25.468 --> 01:28:28.346
<i>is an assertion
of black beauty and black pride.</i>

01:28:31.641 --> 01:28:35.019
There is a black revolution
taking place on many campuses.

01:28:35.228 --> 01:28:37.355
Now, what is your feeling
about this?

01:28:37.855 --> 01:28:39.899
Well, that's very complicated.

01:28:40.149 --> 01:28:41.859
The blacks on the campus
in the first place

01:28:42.068 --> 01:28:44.320
are complete separatists,
the campuses I've visited.

01:28:44.529 --> 01:28:46.281
They don't associate
with the whites,

01:28:46.489 --> 01:28:47.782
they don't eat with the whites,

01:28:47.991 --> 01:28:50.285
they advocate
their own dormitories.

01:28:50.493 --> 01:28:53.788
They seem to me to be going
back in time to separatism,

01:28:53.997 --> 01:28:55.581
when there was a white society
and a black society.

01:28:55.790 --> 01:28:57.375
I got to disagree
with you there now.

01:28:57.583 --> 01:28:59.502
I think it's wrong for blacks
to eat with blacks

01:28:59.711 --> 01:29:00.911
and whites to eat with whites.

01:29:01.087 --> 01:29:02.630
- Well, wait a minute...
- We have been fighting forever

01:29:02.839 --> 01:29:03.881
to get together.

01:29:04.090 --> 01:29:07.385
Why can't I know about me,
if you know about yourself?

01:29:07.593 --> 01:29:09.012
I know more about you
than you do about me.

01:29:09.220 --> 01:29:10.260
You know nothing about me.

01:29:10.388 --> 01:29:11.347
That probably true, Jimmy,
but it's not-

01:29:11.556 --> 01:29:13.766
But I have to know that.
Do you call yourself a man,

01:29:13.975 --> 01:29:16.269
knowing that I pay taxes
same as you,

01:29:16.477 --> 01:29:17.979
to stay right here
and use my sweat and blood

01:29:18.187 --> 01:29:19.227
to help build this country

01:29:19.397 --> 01:29:21.278
and I got to be a second
or third class citizen?

01:29:21.482 --> 01:29:22.525
Do you call that a man?

01:29:23.026 --> 01:29:25.403
I believe you ought to be
as good as me and do...

01:29:25.611 --> 01:29:28.072
Ought to be?
I know I'm good as you!

01:29:28.406 --> 01:29:29.907
What do you mean, ought to be?

01:29:30.408 --> 01:29:32.660
- But the conditions...
- What conditions?

01:29:32.869 --> 01:29:34.329
You haven't had
a fair crack at it.

01:29:34.537 --> 01:29:36.539
A fair crack?
How long does it take, man?

01:29:36.748 --> 01:29:38.207
I'm 36 years old,
when am I supposed

01:29:38.416 --> 01:29:39.917
- to be a grown man?
- Now.

01:29:40.126 --> 01:29:42.170
Oh, I'm supposed to be
a grown man at 21, man,

01:29:42.378 --> 01:29:43.838
<i>no, no, not 36.</i>

01:29:44.839 --> 01:29:48.051
Jimmy, I'm on your side.
What are you so mad about?

01:29:48.343 --> 01:29:51.012
I'm not mad,
I'm just disappointed in you

01:29:51.262 --> 01:29:52.930
being ignorant
to what's going on, man,

01:29:53.139 --> 01:29:54.640
you just don't know
what's happening.

01:29:54.849 --> 01:29:56.351
This is not really a joke.

01:29:56.559 --> 01:29:58.999
You're laughing at something
that's going to be a big problem.

01:29:59.020 --> 01:30:00.780
Because you got kids out there
that can't eat

01:30:00.897 --> 01:30:01.856
and they are robbing
and stealing

01:30:02.065 --> 01:30:03.566
doing what they have to do
to make it

01:30:03.775 --> 01:30:04.859
and if you don't do
something about it,

01:30:05.068 --> 01:30:06.549
we're going to lose the country,
not...

01:30:06.569 --> 01:30:08.029
There is a new survey
out today...

01:30:08.237 --> 01:30:09.237
We don't want the survey,

01:30:09.405 --> 01:30:11.199
the survey is out there
on the street.

01:30:13.242 --> 01:30:16.996
Wait a minute, Jimmy,
you can't do that.

01:30:18.790 --> 01:30:20.208
You've got to open your ears.

01:30:20.416 --> 01:30:22.627
My ears has been open,
have your eyes been open?

01:30:25.254 --> 01:30:26.672
<i>Nixon's the one.</i>

01:30:26.881 --> 01:30:29.759
<i>His lead over Humphrey
was so close but he won it</i>

01:30:29.967 --> 01:30:33.179
<i>and, in winning that,
he won the presidency.</i>

01:30:33.513 --> 01:30:35.223
<i>According to present statistics,</i>

01:30:35.431 --> 01:30:38.810
<i>only 10 percent of the black
vote was cast for Nixon.</i>

01:30:39.018 --> 01:30:40.728
<i>The president has proposed
several plans</i>

01:30:40.937 --> 01:30:43.356
<i>which he claims will assist
the Afro American</i>

01:30:43.564 --> 01:30:44.941
<i>to get a piece of the action.</i>

01:30:45.149 --> 01:30:47.944
<i>The president calls it
"Black Capitalism."</i>

01:30:50.154 --> 01:30:52.949
<i>Richard Nixon saw
there was this great desire</i>

01:30:53.157 --> 01:30:55.535
among professional
middle class members

01:30:55.743 --> 01:30:58.329
<i>of the black community
to make it in America.</i>

01:31:02.667 --> 01:31:06.254
James Brown was privately
very politically conservative.

01:31:07.922 --> 01:31:09.799
<i>He had supported Humphrey in '68</i>

01:31:10.007 --> 01:31:13.261
<i>but James Brown believed
in bootstrap economics,</i>

01:31:13.469 --> 01:31:14.887
<i>lift yourself up.</i>

01:31:15.304 --> 01:31:17.723
So the appeal of Richard Nixon,

01:31:18.182 --> 01:31:22.645
which was a total,
total atrocity to me

01:31:22.854 --> 01:31:25.273
<i>but to James Brown
it was black capitalism.</i>

01:31:44.167 --> 01:31:47.420
We got a food franchise getting
started called "Gold Platter."

01:31:47.712 --> 01:31:49.881
<i>It's basically set up
to get the black man</i>

01:31:50.089 --> 01:31:52.884
<i>into being able to run
and own his own business.</i>

01:31:54.635 --> 01:31:55.678
<i>It's geared to the ghetto</i>

01:31:55.887 --> 01:31:58.014
because I think
every man should help

01:31:58.222 --> 01:32:01.225
where he understands
where it's needed most.

01:32:05.188 --> 01:32:07.648
<i>And we have
the James Brown food stamps,</i>

01:32:07.857 --> 01:32:09.192
<i>which is very important.</i>

01:32:09.400 --> 01:32:11.235
This is the idea of us
getting together

01:32:11.444 --> 01:32:14.280
an idea of getting money
into the black community.

01:32:14.864 --> 01:32:16.449
<i>If we keep the turnover going,</i>

01:32:16.824 --> 01:32:21.829
then we shall overcome,
only if we all come over.

01:32:34.967 --> 01:32:37.929
<i>If I could give you
one specific James Brown song</i>

01:32:38.137 --> 01:32:43.392
where the "one" is underlined
bold and italic...

01:32:44.560 --> 01:32:47.647
...I <i>would say, "I Don't Want
Nobody To Give Me Nothing."</i>

01:32:53.486 --> 01:32:56.405
The James Brown hard beat
was the one.

01:32:56.614 --> 01:33:00.034
It's the beat, but it's also
that you're the one,

01:33:00.243 --> 01:33:02.954
<i>you're setting the tone,
you're the trailblazer.</i>

01:33:05.998 --> 01:33:07.708
<i>He told me,
"You can't be big and small</i>

01:33:07.917 --> 01:33:10.002
at the same time, Reverend,
you got to be the one."

01:33:10.211 --> 01:33:11.337
"You got to be the one."

01:33:29.355 --> 01:33:32.441
<i>At that time, Nixon was
preaching self-reliance</i>

01:33:33.025 --> 01:33:34.652
and not really espousing

01:33:35.027 --> 01:33:37.863
systematic structural change
in society.

01:33:38.072 --> 01:33:41.033
<i>And in a way that fed
into Brown's own illusion</i>

01:33:41.242 --> 01:33:42.660
<i>that he had done it himself</i>

01:33:42.868 --> 01:33:45.246
<i>and that, if he could do it,
other people could do it,</i>

01:33:45.454 --> 01:33:46.455
<i>just by working hard.</i>

01:33:50.376 --> 01:33:51.669
<i>But the fact of the matter is,</i>

01:33:51.877 --> 01:33:54.463
<i>Brown was a supernaturally
talented individual.</i>

01:33:54.672 --> 01:33:56.424
<i>Not everyone else
is that talented</i>

01:33:56.632 --> 01:33:59.010
<i>or that ruthless,
or that driven.</i>

01:34:22.366 --> 01:34:25.453
<i>Well, you know, he said
he was a businessman.</i>

01:34:26.078 --> 01:34:27.496
But he never took care
of business.

01:34:27.705 --> 01:34:30.791
He just hung on to his money,
you know.

01:34:31.626 --> 01:34:34.503
When you tried to own
a radio station, they failed,

01:34:34.712 --> 01:34:36.964
a restaurant, they failed,
you know.

01:34:37.173 --> 01:34:41.969
I mean, this is a man
that would pack an auditorium,

01:34:42.178 --> 01:34:44.805
take boxes of money
out of that auditorium,

01:34:45.014 --> 01:34:46.390
and not pay the band.

01:34:46.599 --> 01:34:48.199
When you got ready to get paid,
you know,

01:34:48.351 --> 01:34:51.312
"Hey, look,
we don't have all of the money."

01:34:51.520 --> 01:34:52.605
"We're going to pay you this amount"

01:34:52.813 --> 01:34:54.690
"and you get the rest
the next couple of days."

01:34:54.899 --> 01:34:57.234
And sometimes, it would happen
and sometimes it wouldn't.

01:34:57.443 --> 01:35:01.072
Actually, we didn't get nothing
from anything, just a salary.

01:35:01.280 --> 01:35:04.200
The most money I made
was around $300

01:35:05.034 --> 01:35:09.622
and I don't remember getting
any checks for recording.

01:35:09.830 --> 01:35:11.582
It was just my regular salary.

01:35:11.791 --> 01:35:15.002
I had gotten to be sort of like
a handyman, you know.

01:35:15.211 --> 01:35:17.254
<i>For whatever reasons.</i>

01:35:17.713 --> 01:35:20.091
<i>You know, James would say,
"Oh, you're not such a big deal,</i>

01:35:20.299 --> 01:35:22.176
<i>Maceo could do that I bet you."</i>

01:35:22.551 --> 01:35:24.472
And I hear him, you know,
from a distance saying,

01:35:24.595 --> 01:35:26.847
"Oh, Lord, what is he
getting me into now?"

01:35:27.056 --> 01:35:30.184
He and I got together, I said,
"Man, I'm working hard,

01:35:30.393 --> 01:35:33.604
am I being, you know, funded
for all this work?"

01:35:34.188 --> 01:35:35.731
And the answer to that was, no.

01:35:35.940 --> 01:35:38.150
<i>Get your James Brown programs!</i>

01:35:38.359 --> 01:35:40.444
<i>His attitude towards politics</i>

01:35:40.653 --> 01:35:43.155
was the same attitude
that he took towards his music.

01:35:47.952 --> 01:35:51.205
<i>On stage, he was the front man
that channeled the energy</i>

01:35:51.414 --> 01:35:53.457
<i>coming from the band
in a totally unique way.</i>

01:35:53.666 --> 01:35:56.794
<i>But it is very easy to fall
into the illusion</i>

01:35:57.002 --> 01:35:58.796
<i>that it's all coming from you.</i>

01:36:02.675 --> 01:36:05.553
<i>There's no way
that the James Brown sound</i>

01:36:05.761 --> 01:36:07.482
would have come together
without the Maceos,

01:36:07.596 --> 01:36:10.641
the Freds, the Pee Wees, Clyde
and on down the line.

01:36:11.809 --> 01:36:13.519
<i>If it wasn't for Pee Wee,</i>

01:36:13.728 --> 01:36:15.896
we wouldn't know
what to do, you know.

01:36:26.323 --> 01:36:30.035
<i>When I came to work for him
in November of '69,</i>

01:36:30.244 --> 01:36:31.244
the thing that I sensed,

01:36:31.412 --> 01:36:33.748
once I got kind
of "behind the scenes,"

01:36:34.039 --> 01:36:36.041
<i>was the discontent in the band.</i>

01:36:36.500 --> 01:36:38.377
<i>The band had just reached
a point</i>

01:36:38.627 --> 01:36:40.588
<i>where they were pumping each...
"We don't need to take this."</i>

01:36:40.796 --> 01:36:43.007
And they came to James
with an ultimatum

01:36:43.215 --> 01:36:45.509
with a list of their gripes
one by one,

01:36:46.385 --> 01:36:49.430
and James is just not the kind
of guy to be intimidated.

01:36:49.638 --> 01:36:51.015
He's like a stone.

01:36:51.223 --> 01:36:52.850
You know, he's like a stone.
You know?

01:36:53.058 --> 01:36:54.351
"I will not be moved."

01:36:55.102 --> 01:36:57.521
<i>What happened is he sent
Bobby Byrd to Cincinnati,</i>

01:36:57.730 --> 01:37:00.065
<i>to round up Bootsy Collins,
his brother Catfish,</i>

01:37:00.274 --> 01:37:01.274
<i>and their little group.</i>

01:37:01.442 --> 01:37:02.860
<i>They had a five
or six-piece band.</i>

01:37:03.068 --> 01:37:06.071
<i>And he had Bobby bring them down
to Georgia.</i>

01:37:06.280 --> 01:37:08.157
He came in a James Brown
Learjet...

01:37:09.533 --> 01:37:11.619
...sent a limo to the club

01:37:11.827 --> 01:37:14.830
over in this rat hole
where we was playing at

01:37:15.039 --> 01:37:17.124
and picked us up

01:37:17.333 --> 01:37:20.002
and everybody was looking at us
like, "Wow."

01:37:20.211 --> 01:37:24.048
You know, and we was, like
"Yeah, James Brown," you know.

01:37:24.256 --> 01:37:28.135
But we didn't find out
what he really wanted

01:37:28.344 --> 01:37:30.137
until we actually got there.

01:37:30.346 --> 01:37:32.973
He parades towards the stage
with this new band.

01:37:33.557 --> 01:37:35.267
So the old guys
are just sitting there,

01:37:35.476 --> 01:37:38.103
literally holding
their instruments and uniforms,

01:37:38.312 --> 01:37:40.981
watching Bootsy
and these guys walk on stage.

01:37:41.190 --> 01:37:45.861
That was the sad part
because they were our heroes

01:37:46.237 --> 01:37:48.197
and we could see,
it's like, dag,

01:37:48.405 --> 01:37:50.574
these cats are mad
about something.

01:37:50.783 --> 01:37:52.159
We didn't know what it was.

01:37:52.368 --> 01:37:55.037
Everybody got their bags
and instruments,

01:37:55.246 --> 01:37:59.542
and who ever had cabs
or rented cars, everybody left.

01:37:59.959 --> 01:38:02.086
And I'm the only somebody
that was left.

01:38:02.294 --> 01:38:03.935
<i>I guess he didn't want to get
into details</i>

01:38:04.004 --> 01:38:06.757
<i>because the people
were at riot stage,</i>

01:38:06.966 --> 01:38:07.967
<i>so he didn't have no time</i>

01:38:08.175 --> 01:38:10.386
<i>for no explanations to us
and this and that.</i>

01:38:10.594 --> 01:38:12.513
<i>And, plus,
we didn't need no explanation.</i>

01:38:12.721 --> 01:38:16.016
<i>It was like, "What you want us
to do, you know? We ready."</i>

01:38:47.089 --> 01:38:48.966
I see a few new faces
in the band.

01:38:49.174 --> 01:38:50.593
Yes, this is a New Breed band.

01:38:50.801 --> 01:38:52.678
Kids like to see
the young kids up there.

01:38:52.887 --> 01:38:54.054
That's the idea.

01:38:56.724 --> 01:38:58.726
<i>These were definitely
his peak years,</i>

01:38:58.934 --> 01:39:02.146
<i>so to lose his band and have
that kind of a transition</i>

01:39:02.688 --> 01:39:04.148
was pretty shocking

01:39:04.356 --> 01:39:06.859
and those of us in the office
were really worried about it.

01:39:07.067 --> 01:39:08.527
<i>And I'll never forget
the first show</i>

01:39:08.736 --> 01:39:09.987
<i>that I saw with the new band,</i>

01:39:10.195 --> 01:39:13.198
<i>which was about a week or two
into their tenure,</i>

01:39:13.407 --> 01:39:15.409
that just to me,
sounded horrible.

01:39:17.703 --> 01:39:20.831
<i>I had to be something
like around 17, 18.</i>

01:39:21.040 --> 01:39:22.400
I want to go out there
and have fun

01:39:22.499 --> 01:39:24.793
I want to get girls
like my brother's getting girls.

01:39:25.002 --> 01:39:27.838
James talking about,
"Nah, son, nah."

01:39:28.047 --> 01:39:31.008
"Nah, can't go out there
and play tonight, nah.

01:39:31.759 --> 01:39:34.094
<i>Got to ride with me.
Ride with me, son."</i>

01:39:34.303 --> 01:39:36.555
He wanted to know
what was on my mind.

01:39:36.764 --> 01:39:39.934
"Why are you laughing
at my shoes?" You know,

01:39:40.142 --> 01:39:41.477
<i>"What's wrong with my cape?"</i>

01:39:42.186 --> 01:39:45.439
<i>You know, I'm saying, I mean,
"wouldn't you wear this?"</i>

01:39:46.357 --> 01:39:50.235
He wanted to know,
what a young kid,

01:39:51.070 --> 01:39:52.154
how he thought about it.

01:39:52.363 --> 01:39:55.115
<i>I remember flying
on the jet with him.</i>

01:39:56.241 --> 01:39:57.284
<i>He'd be telling jokes.</i>

01:39:57.493 --> 01:40:00.663
<i>I mean,
he was the worst joke teller,</i>

01:40:00.871 --> 01:40:01.997
<i>I mean, God.</i>

01:40:02.206 --> 01:40:03.958
But he would be cracking up

01:40:04.166 --> 01:40:07.878
<i>and then he'd act like
he'd go to sleep on you</i>

01:40:08.462 --> 01:40:11.507
<i>and he would bow his head
a little bit,</i>

01:40:11.715 --> 01:40:13.425
then he shut one eye

01:40:13.634 --> 01:40:16.220
and then he keep
the other eye on you.

01:40:16.428 --> 01:40:17.972
That's what he did to me
all the time.

01:40:18.180 --> 01:40:21.016
I say,
don't you go to sleep at all?

01:40:21.225 --> 01:40:25.312
And he was "Nah, you know,
75 percent business,"

01:40:25.521 --> 01:40:27.773
"and 25 percent music."

01:40:28.691 --> 01:40:31.568
<i>He said, "Watch me
and get yourself together."</i>

01:40:31.777 --> 01:40:33.612
<i>"It ain't just coming out here"</i>

01:40:33.862 --> 01:40:35.572
<i>"and lolly-gagging
and having a good time."</i>

01:40:35.781 --> 01:40:39.493
<i>He wanted me to see
that it took hard work.</i>

01:40:39.702 --> 01:40:41.203
I'm like, 'What?

01:40:53.757 --> 01:40:54.883
<i>And James Brown,</i>

01:40:55.092 --> 01:40:58.387
<i>he wasn't on to the new style
that was coming in.</i>

01:41:01.807 --> 01:41:03.308
<i>It really started</i>

01:41:03.517 --> 01:41:07.021
<i>with James Brown teaching me
about the one.</i>

01:41:07.229 --> 01:41:09.670
"Just give me the one, then you
can play all that other stuff.

01:41:09.732 --> 01:41:12.401
But if you give me that one
you can play that."

01:41:12.609 --> 01:41:15.738
And he would tell me that
every night.

01:41:15.946 --> 01:41:18.198
"Nah. You haven't got it, son."

01:41:18.407 --> 01:41:22.453
"No, son, you haven't got it."
You know?

01:41:22.661 --> 01:41:26.248
And I mean, it was so cold,
it was like, dag.

01:41:38.385 --> 01:41:42.681
Little did I know that the way
he was drilling us,

01:41:43.390 --> 01:41:46.435
was all the encouragement
we really needed, you know,

01:41:46.643 --> 01:41:49.063
because it made me
want to practice harder.

01:42:10.709 --> 01:42:13.796
<i>He always said
"Catfish understood," you know,</i>

01:42:14.046 --> 01:42:15.923
<i>because Catfish was older
than me</i>

01:42:16.131 --> 01:42:18.467
and he wasn't wild like me.

01:42:18.675 --> 01:42:22.679
<i>He really loved my brother.
I could see the love.</i>

01:42:34.024 --> 01:42:35.692
<i>Bootsy and Catfish,</i>

01:42:35.901 --> 01:42:38.445
they brought
a complete different rhythm.

01:42:44.785 --> 01:42:47.371
<i>I had to adjust
to playing with them,</i>

01:42:47.579 --> 01:42:48.831
playing James' stuff.

01:42:55.212 --> 01:42:58.465
He took the funk from the drum
and put it in the bass.

01:43:23.115 --> 01:43:25.200
<i>It was a life-changing moment.</i>

01:43:25.534 --> 01:43:27.244
We got the rehearsals,
we got tight.

01:43:38.672 --> 01:43:41.383
<i>James started digging it,
you know, he started grooving.</i>

01:43:41.592 --> 01:43:43.468
<i>He started opening up
after he starts</i>

01:43:43.677 --> 01:43:47.639
seeing that it was
somewhere else to go.

01:43:48.140 --> 01:43:49.892
And it was on then.

01:43:50.058 --> 01:43:51.058
- Fellas!
- Yeah!

01:43:51.185 --> 01:43:52.185
- Fellas!
- Yeah!

01:43:52.311 --> 01:43:54.478
- Fellas!
- Yeah!

01:43:54.479 --> 01:43:56.523
I'm ready to get up
and do my thing.

01:43:58.400 --> 01:44:00.402
I wanna to get up
and do my thing.

01:44:01.570 --> 01:44:04.781
- Like a...
- What?

01:44:05.365 --> 01:44:07.826
Like a sex machine.

01:44:08.202 --> 01:44:10.322
- Got to got it on. Got it on.
- Got it on. Got it on.

01:44:10.412 --> 01:44:11.955
1, 2, 3, 4...

01:44:38.440 --> 01:44:41.109
The song "Sex Machine"
came about on the bus.

01:44:45.072 --> 01:44:47.616
<i>The lyric wasn't saying
all that much</i>

01:44:47.824 --> 01:44:49.665
<i>but the fact that we were saying
"Sex Machine,"</i>

01:44:49.701 --> 01:44:52.246
<i>which weren't supposed
to be said on records,</i>

01:44:52.454 --> 01:44:54.214
you know what I'm saying,
you can't say that,

01:44:54.373 --> 01:44:56.083
you can't say sex, you know,

01:44:56.291 --> 01:44:57.971
and that kind of thing
and they let it out,

01:44:58.210 --> 01:45:02.214
and, of course, at that time,
maybe things was changing.

01:45:37.374 --> 01:45:38.750
<i>Once "Sex Machine" came out,</i>

01:45:38.959 --> 01:45:41.586
<i>and once he had enough time
to really rehearse that band</i>

01:45:41.795 --> 01:45:44.339
<i>and rearrange his music
to fit that band,</i>

01:45:44.548 --> 01:45:47.217
it really did kind of reinvent
the James Brown template.

01:45:51.179 --> 01:45:53.515
<i>And reinvigorated the show</i>

01:45:53.724 --> 01:45:55.642
<i>and, frankly,
the box office results.</i>

01:45:55.851 --> 01:45:58.895
And, you know, six months later,
we're like, okay, we're safe.

01:46:19.875 --> 01:46:22.461
<i>Just 24 hours ago,
these streets were filled</i>

01:46:22.669 --> 01:46:24.546
<i>with rioters, looters
and burglars.</i>

01:46:25.213 --> 01:46:29.343
<i>Six men are dead,
51 businesses have been burned,</i>

01:46:29.551 --> 01:46:31.678
<i>and the National Guard
was called in,</i>

01:46:31.887 --> 01:46:33.555
<i>while city officials
and black leaders</i>

01:46:33.764 --> 01:46:35.474
<i>tried to work out
their differences.</i>

01:46:35.682 --> 01:46:38.560
<i>Negro entertainer, James Brown,
flew into his hometown</i>

01:46:38.769 --> 01:46:41.980
<i>and went on television to tell
black people to "cool it."</i>

01:46:42.189 --> 01:46:43.440
We're can all walk
to the bargaining table

01:46:43.648 --> 01:46:45.650
and sit down and be men
and human beings

01:46:45.859 --> 01:46:49.988
and find something that...
Find a medium of reasoning.

01:46:50.197 --> 01:46:53.492
Brown toured the troubled area,
asking for calm.

01:46:53.909 --> 01:46:55.660
Many blacks say
they listened to him

01:46:55.911 --> 01:46:58.872
and would not have listened
to anyone else.

01:46:59.247 --> 01:47:02.542
Jim Whipkey, WSB News, Augusta.

01:47:02.834 --> 01:47:05.212
Do you feel that whites,
have they accepted you

01:47:05.420 --> 01:47:08.590
because of your ability
to deal with your people?

01:47:09.966 --> 01:47:11.760
I don't like the word accept,
you know.

01:47:11.968 --> 01:47:13.129
You are a beautiful young man

01:47:13.136 --> 01:47:15.096
but I think you're
interviewing me a little wrong.

01:47:15.180 --> 01:47:16.180
How's that, sir?

01:47:16.348 --> 01:47:18.266
I don't think you understand me.

01:47:19.142 --> 01:47:21.812
Number one, I'm not trying
to prove nothing to the white,

01:47:22.062 --> 01:47:23.814
that I can be a head nigger.

01:47:24.106 --> 01:47:25.565
See, that's not my bag.

01:47:25.982 --> 01:47:27.067
I'm a man.

01:47:27.442 --> 01:47:29.361
I'm not trying to make
the white man accept me

01:47:29.569 --> 01:47:30.862
but I would like for people
to accept me

01:47:31.071 --> 01:47:33.031
whether black or white,
you know,

01:47:33.240 --> 01:47:34.400
and understand what I'm doing

01:47:34.408 --> 01:47:36.618
but if they don't I still got
to do what I feel like is right.

01:47:36.827 --> 01:47:38.662
I'm not a cat that get up there
grinning and laughing

01:47:38.870 --> 01:47:40.997
and say take me in,
please, you know.

01:47:41.623 --> 01:47:42.904
I'm saying
don't give me nothing,

01:47:42.999 --> 01:47:44.640
just open the door
and I'll get it myself.

01:48:01.685 --> 01:48:04.271
<i>Mr. Brown, why are you endorsing
President Nixon?</i>

01:48:04.521 --> 01:48:05.881
Well, I'm endorsing
President Nixon

01:48:05.981 --> 01:48:09.109
because I believe in the future
of the country lies

01:48:09.317 --> 01:48:10.861
with Mr. Nixon

01:48:11.069 --> 01:48:14.614
and I feel that some
of the things he's done

01:48:14.823 --> 01:48:17.784
is very close to my heart
as a minority, as a black man.

01:48:21.079 --> 01:48:23.123
<i>I think James Brown
was going to endorse</i>

01:48:23.331 --> 01:48:26.001
<i>whoever was going
to give him an audience.</i>

01:48:26.209 --> 01:48:28.545
<i>If a poor kid from Augusta
who's a soul singer</i>

01:48:28.753 --> 01:48:30.255
can get the White House
on the phone

01:48:30.464 --> 01:48:31.882
once or twice a year,

01:48:32.257 --> 01:48:33.508
that's more important

01:48:33.717 --> 01:48:36.636
than having the phone numbers
of the guy who lost.

01:48:37.471 --> 01:48:39.806
<i>And that confused the hell out
of a lot of people.</i>

01:48:42.809 --> 01:48:44.978
He did not see any difference

01:48:45.187 --> 01:48:49.608
between being strong black,
strong cultural,

01:48:49.900 --> 01:48:51.485
authentic who you was

01:48:51.693 --> 01:48:54.905
<i>but politically being
conservative and Republican</i>

01:48:55.113 --> 01:48:57.282
<i>and it was this paradox.</i>

01:48:57.782 --> 01:48:59.343
So are you saying
that you're Republican

01:48:59.367 --> 01:49:00.367
or Democrat, sir?

01:49:00.535 --> 01:49:03.413
I'm saying that I'm a countryman
and I'm endorsing the country

01:49:03.622 --> 01:49:06.041
and I feel that my best way
of endorsing the country

01:49:06.249 --> 01:49:07.530
is to come
and endorse Mr. Nixon.

01:49:26.603 --> 01:49:28.730
<i>James and Nixon had talked</i>

01:49:28.939 --> 01:49:30.815
and on occasions,

01:49:32.984 --> 01:49:36.112
and Nixon was going
to change some things.

01:50:08.353 --> 01:50:10.313
<i>Before he got
into this Nixon thing</i>

01:50:10.522 --> 01:50:13.817
<i>people would tell him to just be
a musician, be a singer.</i>

01:50:14.025 --> 01:50:15.527
Stay out of the eyes
of the camera

01:50:15.735 --> 01:50:19.114
because that is going to cause you
a problem down the road

01:50:19.322 --> 01:50:20.699
and, of course, it did.

01:50:23.118 --> 01:50:26.871
<i>The blacks turned against him,
the albums were being burned</i>

01:50:27.622 --> 01:50:30.917
and the record sales
went plummeting.

01:50:32.794 --> 01:50:35.088
<i>He knew
that he would be attacked</i>

01:50:35.297 --> 01:50:37.841
<i>and people picketed
James Brown shows.</i>

01:50:38.049 --> 01:50:40.427
What amazed me
is he didn't care.

01:50:40.635 --> 01:50:42.929
He really believed he was right.

01:50:46.641 --> 01:50:48.393
<i>A lot of promises were made,</i>

01:50:48.602 --> 01:50:51.146
a lot of things were said
that didn't never happen.

01:50:53.481 --> 01:50:56.109
<i>Then he got real bitter
about that situation</i>

01:50:56.318 --> 01:50:58.862
<i>and he felt
that he had been let down.</i>

01:51:00.363 --> 01:51:01.781
And he had been let down.

01:51:23.970 --> 01:51:25.263
<i>We have a young man
in the studio</i>

01:51:25.472 --> 01:51:28.808
<i>who's here to make
a presentation to James Brown</i>

01:51:29.017 --> 01:51:30.352
and his name is Al Sharpton.

01:51:32.687 --> 01:51:34.814
<i>1973, I was 18.</i>

01:51:35.023 --> 01:51:37.192
I had a met a young man
named Teddy Brown,

01:51:37.400 --> 01:51:39.069
<i>who was James Brown's son.</i>

01:51:39.277 --> 01:51:41.488
<i>And Teddy got killed
in a car accident.</i>

01:51:41.696 --> 01:51:44.574
<i>James Brown and I
became very close,</i>

01:51:44.783 --> 01:51:48.536
and eventually he became
the father I didn't have,

01:51:48.745 --> 01:51:51.206
and I became
the replacement for Teddy.

01:51:51.414 --> 01:51:52.874
<i>Then he flew me to California</i>

01:51:53.083 --> 01:51:54.443
<i>to give him an award
on Soul Train.</i>

01:51:54.668 --> 01:51:56.044
What do we have here?

01:51:56.252 --> 01:51:58.963
Well, we feel "The Payback"
is sort of like the theme song

01:51:59.172 --> 01:52:01.466
of young black America in 1974

01:52:01.675 --> 01:52:02.995
because it says
many of the things

01:52:03.134 --> 01:52:05.220
that young blacks
have tried to say

01:52:05.428 --> 01:52:09.432
and could not musically express
in our own little way.

01:52:11.142 --> 01:52:12.936
<i>We weren't from
the "We Shall Overcome" era.</i>

01:52:13.144 --> 01:52:15.105
<i>We grew up in the
"I'm Black and Proud"</i>

01:52:15.313 --> 01:52:16.606
<i>and "Payback" era,</i>

01:52:16.815 --> 01:52:19.776
and it was that era
that introduced those of us

01:52:19.984 --> 01:52:21.695
that grew up in the 70's,
80's, 90's.

01:52:29.869 --> 01:52:31.996
By the mid 70's,
James Brown was so much

01:52:32.205 --> 01:52:35.125
of the basic fabric
of American music.

01:52:35.333 --> 01:52:38.128
<i>You could definitely tell
his musical children</i>

01:52:38.336 --> 01:52:39.337
with no problem.

01:52:46.010 --> 01:52:49.389
<i>Easily Michael Jackson,
easily Prince.</i>

01:52:52.517 --> 01:52:53.517
<i>Most people,</i>

01:52:53.685 --> 01:52:56.312
when they look at the mustache
period of James Brown,

01:52:56.521 --> 01:52:58.857
<i>see that as sort of
the beginning-of-the-end period.</i>

01:52:59.065 --> 01:53:03.194
<i>But the true disciple of the
mustache period is Prince.</i>

01:53:03.403 --> 01:53:07.741
<i>So even James Brown's
down period was influential.</i>

01:53:08.908 --> 01:53:10.577
In the late 1970's
when they said

01:53:10.785 --> 01:53:12.829
Mr. Brown was having
all kinds of issues

01:53:13.037 --> 01:53:15.331
and problems
getting a hit record,

01:53:15.540 --> 01:53:17.500
he was hot in the DJ community.

01:53:18.501 --> 01:53:20.170
<i>The B-boys
and the hip hop artists</i>

01:53:20.378 --> 01:53:22.046
<i>were playing
"Get On The Good Foot"</i>

01:53:22.255 --> 01:53:24.299
<i>and especially
the Sex</i> Machine <i>album.</i>

01:53:24.507 --> 01:53:26.384
<i>"Give It Up Or Turn it A Loose"
was the hip-hop</i>

01:53:26.593 --> 01:53:28.303
<i>b-boy break dance anthem,</i>

01:53:28.511 --> 01:53:33.975
so it was like an obvious thing
to actually mimic Mr. Brown.

01:53:34.601 --> 01:53:35.894
<i>In the mid 80's,</i>

01:53:36.102 --> 01:53:38.104
<i>there was a period
in which producers</i>

01:53:38.313 --> 01:53:40.148
would take
these James Brown breaks

01:53:40.356 --> 01:53:42.150
<i>and create all these new songs.</i>

01:53:45.695 --> 01:53:48.907
<i>Funky Drummer was essential
for that classic hip-hop period.</i>

01:53:49.115 --> 01:53:51.034
<i>Everybody used that sound.</i>

01:53:53.578 --> 01:53:54.829
I hate that song.

01:53:56.456 --> 01:54:00.335
Was it the Funky Drummer?
I don't like that song.

01:54:00.835 --> 01:54:03.254
We had been playing somewhere
that night before

01:54:03.463 --> 01:54:06.216
and as we get to Cincinnati
going to check into the hotel

01:54:06.424 --> 01:54:07.424
to go to bed,

01:54:07.592 --> 01:54:10.512
Brown says,
"Go take them to the studio."

01:54:10.720 --> 01:54:13.973
<i>We all were so tired,
didn't even want to record,</i>

01:54:14.224 --> 01:54:16.893
so I started playing
just the drum pattern.

01:54:22.315 --> 01:54:25.151
Brown liked it
and we recorded it

01:54:25.527 --> 01:54:27.445
<i>and it became our
"Funky Drummer."</i>

01:54:27.862 --> 01:54:30.198
They've only had
one failed single,

01:54:30.406 --> 01:54:33.618
and that single's name
was "Funky Drummer."

01:54:35.453 --> 01:54:36.746
Go figure.

01:54:37.539 --> 01:54:39.999
It's like the song that birthed
my whole movement,

01:54:40.208 --> 01:54:43.086
that magic count-off
every rapper loves to hear.

01:54:43.294 --> 01:54:46.256
One, two, three, four, hit it!

01:55:01.271 --> 01:55:05.942
<i>The hip-hop act that best
utilized "Funky Drummer"</i>

01:55:06.150 --> 01:55:07.318
<i>was Public Enemy.</i>

01:55:17.996 --> 01:55:21.165
Fight The Power also sampled
"Hot Pants Road."

01:55:24.919 --> 01:55:25.962
It was just like,
"Wait a minute,

01:55:26.170 --> 01:55:28.631
James Brown is like
all over hip-hop these days."

01:55:33.177 --> 01:55:35.680
<i>James Brown would go into a riff</i>

01:55:35.889 --> 01:55:37.932
and it would be a nice break.

01:55:38.808 --> 01:55:40.435
But for a hip hop record,
you could say,

01:55:40.643 --> 01:55:43.688
"Man, we could take this
for like, five minutes."

01:55:44.105 --> 01:55:45.982
<i>We are going to keep vamping
on the vamp.</i>

01:55:49.986 --> 01:55:52.488
<i>"Fight The Power" comes
from James Brown</i>

01:55:52.989 --> 01:55:56.492
saying it like
it had to be in the 60's.

01:55:59.120 --> 01:56:01.414
I love James Brown.

01:56:01.915 --> 01:56:04.000
<i>There would be no me
without James Brown</i>

01:56:04.208 --> 01:56:05.585
<i>so we all owe it to James Brown.</i>

01:56:07.795 --> 01:56:09.464
<i>My greatest inspiration
of all time,</i>

01:56:09.672 --> 01:56:10.840
musically, is James Brown.

01:56:12.091 --> 01:56:14.552
<i>If you listen to, like,
"Watch The Throne",</i>

01:56:14.761 --> 01:56:18.348
<i>the most soulful part
of the Otis song</i>

01:56:18.556 --> 01:56:20.600
is that sort of climactic...

01:56:26.606 --> 01:56:29.400
<i>The James Brown scream,
it's gospel,</i>

01:56:29.609 --> 01:56:33.613
it's soulful, it's primitive,
sexual, angry...

01:56:37.116 --> 01:56:39.285
<i>Even now, James Brown is here,</i>

01:56:39.494 --> 01:56:41.120
<i>whether you acknowledge it
or not.</i>

01:56:42.914 --> 01:56:45.291
<i>He never saw himself
as a hit artist.</i>

01:56:45.833 --> 01:56:47.627
<i>He always saw himself
as a historic figure.</i>

01:56:47.835 --> 01:56:49.837
He said, "The reason
I'm going to be historic"

01:56:50.046 --> 01:56:51.464
"is I wasn't one of the boys."

01:56:57.011 --> 01:56:58.304
<i>And he would always tell me,</i>

01:56:58.513 --> 01:57:00.473
<i>"Whatever you do in life,
be you, be different."</i>

01:57:01.474 --> 01:57:02.642
<i>I think it was also why</i>

01:57:02.850 --> 01:57:07.063
<i>he was off to himself
in his own way, musically...</i>

01:57:10.441 --> 01:57:12.777
<i>...because he grew up
in the woods, by himself,</i>

01:57:12.986 --> 01:57:14.904
<i>laid there in the whorehouse
by himself,</i>

01:57:15.113 --> 01:57:18.908
<i>so it gave him the sense of,
"Me against the world."</i>

01:57:22.870 --> 01:57:24.080
<i>What was his negative</i>

01:57:24.288 --> 01:57:26.290
<i>may have ended up
being his strength.</i>

01:57:28.251 --> 01:57:29.502
<i>When he got on that stage,</i>

01:57:29.711 --> 01:57:32.588
<i>James Brown
personified his music</i>

01:57:32.797 --> 01:57:35.341
<i>and he reflected
a life experience.</i>

01:57:42.515 --> 01:57:44.058
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
here he is,</i>

01:57:44.267 --> 01:57:46.310
<i>the greatest entertainer
in the world,</i>

01:57:46.519 --> 01:57:51.941
Mr. Please Please himself,
hard-working James Brown!
