Serving time in
Chatswin Penitentiary

00:04.754 --> 00:07.215
one can almost forget
that at some point

00:07.257 --> 00:09.718
your sentence is going to end.

00:09.759 --> 00:12.470
Meeting with college
admissions officers

00:12.512 --> 00:15.598
almost felt like getting
in front of a parole board.

00:15.640 --> 00:19.811
I stayed clean.
I kept to myself, mostly.

00:19.853 --> 00:23.815
I stayed out of trouble,
and I learned a lot

00:23.857 --> 00:27.277
from the experience that I think
will help me on the outside.

00:27.318 --> 00:30.780
I mean...at your
fine university.

00:30.822 --> 00:33.324
[chuckling]
Okay, Tessa, just relax.

00:33.366 --> 00:35.952
Why don't you tell me,
um, a little bit about

00:35.994 --> 00:38.747
your extracurricular activities?

00:38.788 --> 00:42.083
Right. Well, I-I
held a part-time job

00:42.125 --> 00:44.502
at one of the top crystal
retailers on the East Coast

00:44.544 --> 00:47.964
leading their sales division
to record earnings.

00:48.006 --> 00:51.426
I performed in a multicultural
world-music band.

00:51.468 --> 00:53.720
I played lead rain stick.

00:53.762 --> 00:55.722
And when my best friend's family

00:55.764 --> 00:57.766
decided to foster
a Cambodian child

00:57.807 --> 01:00.310
I started an initiative
to help assimilate him

01:00.351 --> 01:04.773
into Chatswin by sometimes
walking him to school.

01:04.814 --> 01:06.733
Very impressive.

01:06.775 --> 01:09.194
I hoped so. I was doing
my best to come off that way.

01:09.235 --> 01:11.488
Since I knew the competition
would be stiff.

01:11.529 --> 01:15.909
I don't have any
curricular activities.

01:15.950 --> 01:19.037
No, your extra-curricular
activities.

01:19.079 --> 01:23.208
What I'm asking is, what do you
do besides just going to school?

01:23.249 --> 01:26.211
Oh. Lots.

01:26.252 --> 01:29.255
I'm super into tanning,
nail care, red carpets

01:29.297 --> 01:33.009
my housekeeper Carmen,
blind items, Brody Jenner

01:33.051 --> 01:37.263
Bentleys, apps, both foodstuffs
and the kind on my phone.

01:37.305 --> 01:39.808
- I'm really into Molly.
- Molly?

01:39.849 --> 01:43.812
My friend Molly Benzworth.
We met on a teen tour.

01:43.853 --> 01:45.939
She's hella chill,
but she drinks too much.

01:45.980 --> 01:47.273

'Anything else?'

01:47.315 --> 01:49.692
I'd like to be a writer someday.

01:49.734 --> 01:53.404
I love Poe, Carver,
Chuck Palahniuk

01:53.446 --> 01:55.115

01:55.156 --> 01:57.325
This all sounds wonderful,
Tessa.

01:57.367 --> 01:58.743
Is there anything else
you want me to know

01:58.785 --> 02:00.453
before we wrap up
our little chat?

02:00.495 --> 02:03.373
I like snapchatting,
Skype-chatting, chit-chatting

02:03.414 --> 02:07.085
and I love,
love accessorizing.

02:07.127 --> 02:09.295
- Like so, so much.
- Accessorizing.

02:09.337 --> 02:11.005
I just tend to put
a lot of thought

02:11.047 --> 02:13.716
into thinking about ways to
make an outfit really pop.

02:13.758 --> 02:15.885
I wonder if you put
a fraction of that thought

02:15.927 --> 02:17.137
into your grades.

02:17.178 --> 02:19.097
Oh, I didn't.

02:19.139 --> 02:21.099
I really try not to
focus on my grades

02:21.141 --> 02:23.476
because I don't
believe they define me..

02:23.518 --> 02:24.894
...not the way
a good belt can.

02:24.936 --> 02:27.105
- I'm sorry?
- Don't be.

02:27.147 --> 02:30.567
A lot of people
make the same mistake.

02:30.608 --> 02:32.318
But I'm sure there's
a waistline hiding

02:32.360 --> 02:35.947
under that big, bulky
sweater of yours somewhere.

02:35.989 --> 02:39.242
In fact, I know there is.

02:40.243 --> 02:43.163
Anyway, you've been great.

I will.
It'll be a cinch.

crazy robot heads?

10:22.913 --> 10:24.874
Microwaves.

10:24.915 --> 10:27.084
And that's your station.

10:35.176 --> 10:37.261
I want the office
with the window.

10:37.303 --> 10:39.221
That's the drive-through window.

10:39.263 --> 10:41.432
- And, no.
- I want a raise.

10:41.474 --> 10:43.392
I don't think
this is gonna work out.

10:43.434 --> 10:44.894
Thank you for
considering me.

10:44.935 --> 10:47.355
Food service clearly
wasn't Dalia's calling.

10:47.396 --> 10:51.609
So, she decided to try Carmen's
advice about the military.

10:52.860 --> 10:55.821
Get it, girl.
Al-Qaeda's coming!

10:58.074 --> 11:00.368
And time!

11:00.409 --> 11:03.204
Well, I guess master gunnery
sergeant isn't in the cards

11:03.245 --> 11:05.831
which is a shame 'cause
their emblem's so darn cute.

11:05.873 --> 11:08.584
Maybe something
more blue collar.

11:08.626 --> 11:12.588
Or a Mandarin collar.
Or collar-less.

11:12.630 --> 11:14.674
Or maybe something
more...coveralls.

11:16.258 --> 11:18.594
Oh, crap.
You hear that?

11:18.636 --> 11:21.472
It keeps making that rattle.

11:21.514 --> 11:23.140
Did you check the belt?

11:23.182 --> 11:27.103
90 percent of life's problems
are belt-related.

11:27.144 --> 11:30.314
- Car ready?
- Oh, hey. No, not yet, sir.

11:30.356 --> 11:32.024
We just need a couple
more minutes with her.

11:32.066 --> 11:34.402
Tell you what, why don't
I have Dalia wheel you outside

11:34.443 --> 11:36.821
so you don't have to smell
our fumes..

11:36.862 --> 11:39.824
...and so I don't
have to smell his.

11:39.865 --> 11:41.617
'Kay.

11:41.659 --> 11:44.453
[instrumental music]

11:45.830 --> 11:48.541
I like your wheelchair.
It's tight.

11:50.084 --> 11:51.085
(George)
'$50.'

11:51.127 --> 11:53.587
- No!
- $60?

11:53.629 --> 11:56.716
You do realize you are
trying to pay your daughter

11:56.757 --> 12:00.386
to go on a date with someone
she doesn't like?

12:00.428 --> 12:04.515
If I accepted, think about
what that would make me.

12:04.557 --> 12:06.142
A team player?

12:06.183 --> 12:07.852
You're a terrible parent.
Get out of my room!

12:07.893 --> 12:10.855
Okay, what if I could talk
to Kenny? You know, change him.

12:10.896 --> 12:12.773
What-what-what is it about him
that you don't like?

12:12.815 --> 12:17.194
Are you kidding, George? He's a
total mama's boy. He's pathetic.

12:17.236 --> 12:21.073
Pathetic or completely justified
with an amazing mama like her?

12:21.115 --> 12:23.367
What is so amazing about her,
George?

12:23.409 --> 12:26.120
Please, enlighten me.

12:26.162 --> 12:27.580
Okay. Okay.

12:27.621 --> 12:32.209
For starters,
she smells fantastic.

12:32.251 --> 12:35.713
She has long, shiny hair.

12:35.755 --> 12:39.592
She told that hilarious story
about what great time

12:39.633 --> 12:41.177
they made on the way
over to our place.

12:41.218 --> 12:43.971
She's a boring,
beautiful woman.

12:44.013 --> 12:46.140
You just like her
because she's hot.

12:46.182 --> 12:49.101
I, however, have
slightly higher standards.

12:49.143 --> 12:51.937
So, what you're saying is
you'd love to be there

12:51.979 --> 12:54.315
but you've come down with
a bad case of rickets.

12:54.356 --> 12:57.234
- I get it.
- You're pathetic.

12:59.737 --> 13:02.656
Mommy?
Mommy, where are you?

13:02.698 --> 13:05.075
Dalia? Is everything okay?

13:05.117 --> 13:07.203
Everything is better than okay.

13:07.244 --> 13:10.498
I found my future.
It was at that smelly garage.

13:10.539 --> 13:12.458
[gasps]
Oh, my gosh, yes!

13:12.500 --> 13:15.920
The future is always in the last
place you think to look for it.

13:15.961 --> 13:17.755
You're a grease monkey!
I knew it!

13:17.797 --> 13:19.965
No, mommy, I'm not.

13:20.007 --> 13:21.926
No? Well, then what are you?
Accountant?

13:21.967 --> 13:23.385
- No.
- Air traffic controller?

13:23.427 --> 13:24.553
- No.
- Tastemaker?

13:24.595 --> 13:27.264
- No.
- Humorist?

13:27.306 --> 13:30.267
Close your eyes
and hold your nose.

13:30.309 --> 13:32.394
What?

13:34.396 --> 13:35.481
[sighs]

13:41.987 --> 13:44.365
This is Harold.

13:44.406 --> 13:46.367
I'm his problem now.

13:46.408 --> 13:48.619
'But we have to build
a ramp to my room.'

13:48.661 --> 13:50.830
That's Carmen's problem now.

13:58.587 --> 14:01.006
[instrumental music]

14:01.048 --> 14:02.967
Dalia, you cannot do this!

14:03.008 --> 14:05.594
You cannot go out with
that decrepit old man.

14:05.636 --> 14:08.305
That decrepit old man
is my everything.

14:08.347 --> 14:09.431
We're soul mates.

14:09.473 --> 14:10.933
Now, if you'll excuse me

14:10.975 --> 14:12.643
I need to get him started
on some fluids.

14:12.685 --> 14:14.395
Dalia, he is not
your soul mate.

14:14.436 --> 14:16.105
He barely has a soul left.

14:16.146 --> 14:19.525
You can't have any kind of life
with that dried-up

14:19.567 --> 14:21.652
shriveled-up, absent-minded

14:21.694 --> 14:24.154
brittle sack of nothing.

14:26.365 --> 14:29.869
Mother-in-laws never like me.

14:29.910 --> 14:32.371
- I won't let you do it.
- I'm an adult.

14:32.413 --> 14:36.458
I don't need you to let me.
I can let myself.

14:36.500 --> 14:39.712
Dalia's safety school was
an old man in a wheelchair

14:39.753 --> 14:43.215
so Dallas realized she had to
get her into her first choice

14:43.257 --> 14:45.426
by any means necessary.

14:45.467 --> 14:47.344
Ms. Royce,
what can I do for you?

14:47.386 --> 14:49.388
You can let my baby
into this school.

14:49.430 --> 14:51.849
- I can't do that.
- Oh, but I think you can.

14:51.891 --> 14:54.643
See, I'm prepared
to write you a check

14:54.685 --> 14:57.938
that will make you look upon
my daughter very differently.

14:57.980 --> 15:00.024
So, what you need?
New medical school?

15:00.065 --> 15:02.484
It's on me. Let's cure some
things up in this bitch!

15:02.526 --> 15:05.404
Miss Royce, please, it's clear
that you love your daughter

15:05.446 --> 15:08.699
and I admire that but her
admittance can't be bought.

15:08.741 --> 15:12.161
to be earned.
I'm sorry.

15:14.830 --> 15:16.206
[sighs]

15:17.708 --> 15:19.501
I blew it.

15:19.543 --> 15:21.503
I bought her
so many actual gifts

15:21.545 --> 15:24.089
I forgot to nurture
her natural gifts.

15:24.131 --> 15:26.091
That's not entirely true.

15:26.133 --> 15:28.427
As I recall, she offered me

15:28.469 --> 15:31.639
some very keen fashion advice.

15:31.680 --> 15:34.975
- She did?
- She suggested I "Belt it."

15:35.017 --> 15:38.854
I tell you, it's made
a world of difference.

15:38.896 --> 15:40.648
Even my wife noticed.

15:40.689 --> 15:44.401
So, when it comes to belts,
Dalia really knows her stuff.

15:44.443 --> 15:46.612
[gasps]
Oh, my gosh!

15:46.654 --> 15:48.781
Not about your sexuality,
I totally called that one

15:48.822 --> 15:50.407
but, huh!

15:50.449 --> 15:52.451
Dalia does have a gift!

15:52.493 --> 15:54.787
It will be a cinch.
Did you check the belt?

15:54.828 --> 15:56.288
Not the way a good belt can.

15:56.330 --> 15:58.248
Which singer should
we vote for, Dalia?

15:58.290 --> 16:01.418
The one that can belt.

16:01.460 --> 16:05.172
That's it! That's her future!
I've seen it!

16:05.214 --> 16:06.757
Belts!

16:06.799 --> 16:08.592
Thank you.

16:08.634 --> 16:10.594
Well, you guys
look great tonight.

16:10.636 --> 16:12.846
- Thank you.
- Thanks, George.

16:12.888 --> 16:14.890
So, you do anything
exciting today?

16:14.932 --> 16:16.976
- Are you asking me or my mom?
- Both of you.

16:17.017 --> 16:19.019
But, Karen why don't you go
ahead and take this one.

16:19.061 --> 16:22.398
Mm-hmm, well,
I made incredible time

16:22.439 --> 16:23.649
on the way to the restaurant.

16:23.691 --> 16:25.109
I think I hit every green light.

16:25.150 --> 16:27.194
Wait, what did I stop,
like, twice, Kenny?

16:27.236 --> 16:30.239
I don't know.
So, Tessa's really sick, huh?

16:30.280 --> 16:32.950
- What did you say she had?
- Rickets. Heh, heh.

16:32.992 --> 16:36.036
No, I know what you're thinking,
but they are back in a big way.

16:36.078 --> 16:39.540
She might die, so..
She'll be fine, though, someday.

16:39.581 --> 16:42.793
She just needs to get
some sunlight. Ahem.

16:42.835 --> 16:47.131
And, uh...milk?
I think? I don't know.

16:47.172 --> 16:49.758
Anyway, so, Karen,
GPS or free-balling?

16:49.800 --> 16:51.218
I think you're full of it.

16:51.260 --> 16:52.803
I don't think
Tessa's really sick.

16:52.845 --> 16:53.846
- Kenny.
- No, she..

16:53.887 --> 16:56.223
No, she's absolutely sick.

16:56.265 --> 16:57.641
Then I'm gonna go check on her.

16:57.683 --> 16:59.059
Great idea.

16:59.101 --> 17:01.687
And I suppose she'll be
really happy to see me.

17:01.729 --> 17:04.732
Yes, if she isn't,
it's on account of the--

17:04.773 --> 17:07.943
- Rickets.
- The rickets. Exactly.

17:10.154 --> 17:11.405
Oh.

17:13.365 --> 17:16.243
Kenny just really
likes your daughter.

17:16.285 --> 17:18.495
I know how he feels.

17:20.789 --> 17:23.125
But, I should probably
be honest, Karen.

17:23.167 --> 17:25.586
I don't think
the feeling's mutual.

17:25.627 --> 17:28.422
Tessa doesn't have rickets.
I wish she did.

17:28.464 --> 17:30.257
Well, I-I don't wish she did.

17:30.299 --> 17:33.177
I wish that was why
she's not here.

17:33.218 --> 17:37.389
She's just not...uh,
into Kenny, you know?

17:37.431 --> 17:38.932
Not the way I'm into you.

17:38.974 --> 17:42.603
Mm-hmm.
I know how she feels.

17:42.644 --> 17:45.856
- I thought you loved Kenny.
- I love Kenny!

17:45.898 --> 17:48.650
you.

17:48.692 --> 17:50.194
I only agreed
to go out with you

17:50.235 --> 17:54.114
because Kenny was so smitten
with your daughter.

17:54.156 --> 17:58.035
But if that's not happening,
neither is this.

18:01.497 --> 18:05.042
Yeah, well, guess who's getting
stuck in rush hour, heh heh.

18:15.094 --> 18:16.095
[instrumental music]

18:16.136 --> 18:19.098
[both grunting]

18:19.139 --> 18:21.100
You need to stop
eating carbs, Harold.

18:21.141 --> 18:24.353
I weigh 63 pounds,
you weakling.

18:24.394 --> 18:27.815
Dalia Oprah!
Drop that elderly.

18:27.856 --> 18:31.902
Dalia, I sincerely apologize
if I have ill-prepared you

18:31.944 --> 18:33.654
for the world
and-or made you feel like

18:33.695 --> 18:37.074
you didn't have a place,
but you do! I glimpsed it.

18:37.116 --> 18:40.369
The answer has been right below
our waists this whole time.

18:40.410 --> 18:43.163
- Hooking?
- No, silly. Belts!

18:43.205 --> 18:45.290
Belts?
What kind of belts?

18:45.332 --> 18:47.459
Leather belts,
replacement belts, buckle belts

18:47.501 --> 18:49.962
title belts, braided belts,
sour belts, skinny belts

18:50.003 --> 18:53.048
wide belts, snake belts,
chain belts, cummerbunds

18:53.090 --> 18:55.592
big buckle belts,
elastic belts, sash?

18:55.634 --> 18:56.802
That's what
I'm trying to tell--

18:56.844 --> 18:58.137
Studded belts, beaded belts

18:58.178 --> 18:59.513
printed belts, woven belts

18:59.555 --> 19:01.056
cowboy belts, monogrammed

19:01.098 --> 19:04.101
natural fiber, attached?

19:04.143 --> 19:06.854
You done?
I truly believe--

19:06.895 --> 19:10.232
- Grosgrain self-tie?
- We found your calling!

19:10.274 --> 19:12.276
I'm breaking up with you.

19:14.570 --> 19:17.114
[Tessa chuckling]

19:21.410 --> 19:23.745
Kenny, I-I'm sorry
I lied to you.

19:23.787 --> 19:25.706
'Tessa does not have rickets
as you can see.'

19:25.747 --> 19:28.417
She just didn't wanna
hang out with you.

19:28.458 --> 19:31.795
Actually...Kenny's cool.

19:31.837 --> 19:33.714
He's a lot easier to like
when I'm not being

19:33.755 --> 19:35.549
forced to like him.

19:35.591 --> 19:40.262
Yeah, we get along a lot better
when our parents aren't around.

19:40.304 --> 19:42.764
Really?

19:42.806 --> 19:46.268
You don't think
the same could be..

19:46.310 --> 19:48.896
Is it worth trying again
with your awesome mom?

19:48.937 --> 19:53.483
- Sure. Go for it.
- Hey, nothing ventured.

19:57.738 --> 20:00.115
Not a chance in hell.

20:00.157 --> 20:03.243
I wasn't even in college yet
and I was already leaving

20:03.285 --> 20:05.662
poor George
to fend for himself.

20:05.704 --> 20:08.498
But the fact was,
the future was coming

20:08.540 --> 20:10.667
and all any of us could do
to prepare for it

20:10.709 --> 20:12.628
was...buckle up.

20:12.669 --> 20:14.338
Get 'em, girl.

20:16.757 --> 20:19.218
- Can I help you?
- These belts are awesome!

20:19.259 --> 20:21.303
- I know.
- I'll take all of them!

20:21.345 --> 20:24.723
- Cash or credit?
- Cash or credit, baby?

20:24.765 --> 20:27.559
Cash.

20:27.601 --> 20:30.354
He's heavier than he looks,
so lift with your knees.
