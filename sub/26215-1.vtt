00:36.108 --> 00:40.191
- One thousand
four hundred and forty.

00:40.220 --> 00:42.370
That's how many minutes
there are in a day.

00:45.290 --> 00:47.300
Eighty six thousand four hundred seconds

00:47.300 --> 00:49.050
if you want to stretch it out more.

00:53.450 --> 00:55.680
But most people think they have

00:55.680 --> 00:57.483
an endless supply of time.

01:16.614 --> 01:18.050
Then there are those who

01:18.050 --> 01:19.600
don't want to face time at all.

01:27.210 --> 01:28.860
- You're supposed to be sleeping.

01:31.130 --> 01:32.103
Like Simon.

01:34.720 --> 01:35.553
It's open.

01:43.669 --> 01:44.502
- Shit, Wanda.

01:44.502 --> 01:45.403
Fucking kids?

01:46.730 --> 01:48.130
- You didn't take that pill?

01:48.600 --> 01:49.897
- 'Course I did.

01:49.897 --> 01:51.547
- You should be sleeping.

01:52.889 --> 01:54.056
- Didn't work.

01:54.229 --> 01:55.896
- You never took it!

02:19.143 --> 02:20.393
Freda, get out.

02:22.651 --> 02:23.484
Get out!

04:35.780 --> 04:38.920
- Oh fuck, that's good
luck in some countries.

04:38.920 --> 04:39.753
- Papi!

04:41.003 --> 04:43.183
- Hey, got a cigarette?

04:51.564 --> 04:52.764
Hey! How about 50 cents?

04:57.913 --> 05:01.163
- Yeah, okay.

05:05.290 --> 05:06.123
- Hey, chica.

05:54.729 --> 05:55.720
- You're supposed to be working.

05:55.720 --> 05:57.563
- What the hell does
it look like I'm doing?

06:00.278 --> 06:01.111
- Oh yeah.

06:06.888 --> 06:08.971
Pretty good, pretty good.

06:19.023 --> 06:20.190
Now get the fuck up

06:20.190 --> 06:21.490
and put them in the truck.

06:22.520 --> 06:24.073
- Alright, keep your shirt on.

06:27.470 --> 06:28.570
- Where's the cripple?

06:29.090 --> 06:29.923
- Uh...

06:29.923 --> 06:31.120
- Where the fuck is she?

06:31.800 --> 06:32.633
- I don't know, Sonny.

06:32.633 --> 06:33.603
She was right here.

06:33.860 --> 06:35.750
I mean, she moves as
fast as a fucking slug,

06:35.750 --> 06:36.853
she ain't gone far.

06:37.259 --> 06:38.092
- Christ, you're stupid.

06:38.092 --> 06:39.220
Put some fucking clothes on.

06:40.089 --> 06:40.922
- Okay.

06:41.450 --> 06:42.283
Shit.

06:42.610 --> 06:44.493
- Freda! Where the fuck are ya?

06:53.877 --> 06:54.710
- Mom?

06:54.710 --> 06:55.543
- You gotta get up.

06:55.543 --> 06:56.376
Jesus.

07:00.140 --> 07:01.380
- If anybody's hiding that cripple,

07:01.380 --> 07:02.630
you'd better think twice!

07:03.280 --> 07:04.643
Fucking cocksuckers.

07:04.646 --> 07:05.479
- Okay, come here.

07:05.500 --> 07:06.640
- Why is he not in the truck?

07:06.640 --> 07:07.473
Move it.

07:07.473 --> 07:08.603
- He's too heavy!

07:16.614 --> 07:20.114
- Think you can outsmart me, cripple? Huh?

07:25.358 --> 07:26.191
- Oh shit.

07:34.610 --> 07:35.673
- Jesus, Sonny!

07:38.089 --> 07:39.840
You're waking up the whole damn motel.

07:39.840 --> 07:40.680
- Fuck off, Javier.

07:40.680 --> 07:43.030
Or I'll find a new shit-box
for my whores, hmm?

07:43.510 --> 07:44.360
- You can't come around here

07:44.360 --> 07:45.880
hollering like some madman, you know?

07:45.880 --> 07:48.117
You're scaring the shit out of everybody!

07:48.118 --> 07:49.550
- You should tell your story walking.

07:53.063 --> 07:54.915
If anybody's hiding the little girl,

07:54.915 --> 07:56.696
you'd better send her out!

07:58.220 --> 07:59.053
- Get away!

07:59.053 --> 08:01.193
Before that crazy man kills us all.

08:01.193 --> 08:02.683
- Or else I'm coming in.

08:03.766 --> 08:04.903
- Please let me in!

08:04.903 --> 08:06.880
- Only God can save you now.

08:06.880 --> 08:08.530
- And if I have to come in there,

08:08.580 --> 08:10.200
you ain't coming out!

08:11.437 --> 08:12.887
You hiding the girl in there?

08:14.420 --> 08:15.333
- That one's empty, asshole.

08:26.580 --> 08:28.330
- I wish I could fly away with you.

08:57.157 --> 09:01.657
- You think you can
outsmart me, cripple? Huh?

09:01.817 --> 09:02.650
- Fuck!

09:06.817 --> 09:08.523
Get the fuck out, Sonny!

09:09.320 --> 09:10.720
I'm trying to make a living.

09:11.417 --> 09:12.793
- Angel, what the fuck?

09:14.500 --> 09:15.913
Look at you now, a street whore.

09:15.913 --> 09:17.833
- I'm not your bitch anymore.

09:18.090 --> 09:18.923
Thank God!

09:19.900 --> 09:21.923
- Jack? Holy shit, buddy.

09:22.297 --> 09:26.125
When'd you get out? Hmm?

09:26.125 --> 09:28.042
What're you doing here?

09:28.966 --> 09:30.566
You gonna kidnap my woman again?

09:35.577 --> 09:37.780
You wouldn't do that, would ya?

09:37.780 --> 09:38.613
I want you to know,

09:38.613 --> 09:39.700
that crazy brother of yours

09:39.700 --> 09:41.023
is on my hit list.

09:41.920 --> 09:43.173
When I find that fucker,

09:44.129 --> 09:45.079
I'm gonna hurt him.

09:46.280 --> 09:47.913
- Don't hurt Norman, Sonny.

09:49.880 --> 09:51.743
Please, you got no reason.

09:52.270 --> 09:55.093
- Uh, I got 8000 reasons, Jack.

10:00.550 --> 10:01.383
Ah, shit.

10:01.880 --> 10:02.713
- Fuck, fucker.

10:04.151 --> 10:04.984
Fucker.

10:06.729 --> 10:07.562
Fuck.

10:11.300 --> 10:12.133
- Don't think I won't find the fucker

10:12.133 --> 10:13.493
that called the cops on me.

10:22.750 --> 10:23.583
- Fuck!

10:24.529 --> 10:26.060
- You don't think the cops
can hear us themselves?

10:26.060 --> 10:27.670
Stupid of you, firing that gun!

10:27.670 --> 10:29.570
- Now watch your fucking mouth, woman.

10:30.060 --> 10:31.450
- Well, are we gonna go back?

10:31.450 --> 10:33.250
- What, with all the cops there? No!

10:33.640 --> 10:34.473
I got a plan.

10:34.810 --> 10:36.113
Two birds with one stone.

10:49.640 --> 10:51.143
- Nothing happening here.

10:53.169 --> 10:54.002
- Don't go.

10:54.949 --> 10:55.799
I need more time.

10:56.140 --> 10:57.317
- I'm on the clock.

11:00.138 --> 11:03.093
- You can, you can have
everything I've got.

11:04.630 --> 11:06.503
Take everything I have.

11:08.919 --> 11:09.752
Don't go.

11:11.820 --> 11:15.237
- What the fuck.

11:42.250 --> 11:43.350
- Help someone, Freda.

11:43.960 --> 11:45.260
Then the stars will shine.

11:46.110 --> 11:48.110
It's the only way out of your nightmare.

11:51.750 --> 11:52.583
- Mom?

11:53.070 --> 11:54.613
- Go back to sleep, Simon.

11:54.680 --> 11:55.513
- Where's Freda?

11:56.270 --> 11:58.243
- You better shut that kid up before I do.

11:58.650 --> 12:00.473
- She ain't with us, she ran off.

12:01.760 --> 12:02.960
- Mom, we gotta go back!

12:03.910 --> 12:05.913
- You get off of him, he's just a kid!

12:05.930 --> 12:07.630
- You don't think I wanna go back?

12:07.713 --> 12:10.120
That little gimp's going
on a three day vacation,

12:10.120 --> 12:12.270
do you know how much
fucking money that is?

12:12.369 --> 12:13.849
- Hey! Let him go!

12:13.849 --> 12:15.266
He can't breathe!

12:15.310 --> 12:16.143
Sonny!

12:21.918 --> 12:23.335
- Open your legs.

12:25.050 --> 12:26.760
- No, no, Sonny. No, no, no, please.

12:26.760 --> 12:28.130
- I warned you about that mouth,

12:28.130 --> 12:29.687
and I warned you about crossing me

12:29.687 --> 12:30.520
when I'm teaching the boy manners.

12:30.520 --> 12:31.813
Now open your fucking legs.

12:44.813 --> 12:45.663
- Fuck!

12:51.855 --> 12:52.855
- I'm sorry.

12:53.163 --> 12:54.103
- I know you are.

12:57.360 --> 12:58.660
Come here, momma, come on.

12:59.575 --> 13:00.408
Come here.

13:03.427 --> 13:04.307
I did it for you,

13:04.307 --> 13:06.557
you understand that, right?

15:07.430 --> 15:08.263
- Pay the man.

15:09.510 --> 15:10.703
Pump gas, you moron.

15:28.570 --> 15:30.670
Should run your little ass over right now.

15:34.990 --> 15:35.823
Hey, Angel.

15:36.380 --> 15:37.213
Hey, what's up?

15:37.627 --> 15:38.673
Yeah, well, fuck you too.

15:39.379 --> 15:40.229
Now listen to me.

15:40.860 --> 15:41.693
Here's what I need.

15:41.693 --> 15:43.417
His little fuckhead brother owes me money,

15:43.417 --> 15:45.233
got the small problem with Jack.

15:46.020 --> 15:46.853
Hold on a sec.

15:48.580 --> 15:49.413
- Howdy.

16:00.260 --> 16:02.010
- Go ahead, it's $40.

16:09.490 --> 16:10.740
- How come we left Freda?

16:11.133 --> 16:12.423
- It's her own damn fault.

16:13.380 --> 16:15.410
- I got a guy that's
fucking waiting for her.

16:15.410 --> 16:16.987
Do you understand me right now?

16:17.180 --> 16:19.230
- Why do you let him treat us all so bad?

16:19.370 --> 16:20.687
He don't even love you.

16:23.548 --> 16:26.048
- What do you know about love?

16:28.217 --> 16:29.960
- He wouldn't hurt you like that.

16:29.960 --> 16:31.310
- Yeah, I can handle Sonny.

16:32.217 --> 16:33.717
- I just see him handling you.

16:38.820 --> 16:39.653
- Look at me.

16:41.326 --> 16:43.373
We're the same coin, you understand me?

16:43.610 --> 16:44.907
That's why I love him.

16:45.878 --> 16:48.653
Because he's not afraid like other men.

16:50.060 --> 16:50.893
Like you.

16:52.650 --> 16:53.903
- Oh, hey, hey, cowboy?

16:55.280 --> 16:56.650
Sure is a sexy little thing, ain't she?

16:56.650 --> 16:57.483
- Yeah, she is.

16:58.640 --> 16:59.743
She's real sexy.

16:59.820 --> 17:01.897
- Yeah, well, how'd you
like to spend a few minutes

17:01.897 --> 17:03.503
with that pretty little peach over there?

17:03.820 --> 17:05.973
- So, uh, so she aint taken, then?

17:06.887 --> 17:08.473
- No. No, she ain't taken.

17:09.609 --> 17:10.859
How much she worth to ya?

17:11.689 --> 17:13.260
- Ahh.

17:13.260 --> 17:14.563
I got it. Alright.

17:15.497 --> 17:16.914
Alright, alright.

17:17.397 --> 17:18.367
- Come on, what you got?

17:18.367 --> 17:20.284
- Let's see what I got.

17:20.960 --> 17:22.083
Here, right there.

17:23.310 --> 17:24.190
- Yeah, that's it?

17:24.190 --> 17:26.063
- That's what I got, take it or leave it.

17:26.349 --> 17:27.877
- Little cheap fucker, ain't you?

17:27.877 --> 17:28.711
- Take it or leave it.

17:28.868 --> 17:29.943
- Right, hold on one second.

17:30.377 --> 17:33.377
Come on.

17:34.117 --> 17:34.950
Why don't you go ahead

17:34.950 --> 17:36.457
and give him $60 worth, sugar.

17:37.093 --> 17:39.283
- No, I'm really sore right now.

17:40.060 --> 17:41.247
Can we just head home?

17:41.948 --> 17:42.781
Be alone?

17:43.553 --> 17:46.228
- No, no, we can't go home, sweetheart.

17:46.228 --> 17:48.788
Give you a little of this, hmm?

17:48.788 --> 17:50.833
Give him $60 worth, come on.

17:51.289 --> 17:52.122
Come on.

17:52.740 --> 17:53.573
- Hi.

17:53.573 --> 17:54.406
- How you doing?

17:54.406 --> 17:55.239
- Pretty good.

17:55.239 --> 17:56.072
- Alright, uh...

17:57.892 --> 17:59.192
This is my rig right here.

18:00.660 --> 18:02.187
- Where's Mom going?

18:02.780 --> 18:04.533
- Where the fuck you think she's going?

18:09.410 --> 18:11.363
- I, I gotta pee.

18:13.010 --> 18:13.843
- Get on with it,

18:13.843 --> 18:15.150
I ain't your fucking nursemaid.

18:17.218 --> 18:18.200
- Go back here, okay?

18:18.200 --> 18:19.033
- Yeah, just go on back there

18:19.033 --> 18:20.103
and make yourself cozy.

18:36.340 --> 18:37.293
- Hey, little lady.

18:39.280 --> 18:42.163
Oh, your momma just up and left you again?

18:43.090 --> 18:46.653
You know, she and that Sonny,

18:47.960 --> 18:49.560
they ain't welcome here no more.

18:50.730 --> 18:51.723
You hear me?

18:52.000 --> 18:54.313
- The whole motel hears you, Javier.

18:55.132 --> 18:58.547
- There's a lot of things I could do

18:58.547 --> 19:00.040
with a sweet little thing

19:00.040 --> 19:01.733
who can't run on me.

19:06.340 --> 19:08.093
- Beauty is your choice to see.

19:09.150 --> 19:10.163
- I know, Bella.

19:10.510 --> 19:12.503
But I can't see it without you.

19:23.060 --> 19:25.333
- Oh fuck.

19:26.870 --> 19:27.737
I'm coming!

19:30.290 --> 19:31.123
- Where's Simon at?

19:31.870 --> 19:33.393
- Sonny. He took him.

19:40.310 --> 19:41.833
He was so limp.

19:42.170 --> 19:43.313
He looked dead.

19:44.020 --> 19:44.853
- Was he dead?

19:45.360 --> 19:48.533
- Drugged. Momma's candy.

19:51.620 --> 19:53.163
Sonny wasn't here for Simon.

19:53.920 --> 19:54.883
He was here for me.

20:01.930 --> 20:02.763
- What is it?

20:03.720 --> 20:05.233
- It's one of Simon's marbles.

20:05.960 --> 20:08.410
We made a promise that if
he ever was in trouble,

20:08.510 --> 20:09.760
he'd leave a white marble

20:10.920 --> 20:13.020
and I'd come and find him, no matter what.

20:14.340 --> 20:15.990
We've gotta get to Sonny's place.

20:16.090 --> 20:17.140
- That's a terrible idea,

20:17.140 --> 20:18.393
you've finally got away.

20:18.460 --> 20:20.460
- There's no getting away without Simon,

20:20.612 --> 20:21.823
and you know that, Bella.

20:24.770 --> 20:26.320
- That's a dollar seventy-five.

20:31.060 --> 20:32.263
- You thieving bitch!

20:32.290 --> 20:33.433
You give me that back!

20:35.601 --> 20:37.560
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, cowboy.

20:37.960 --> 20:38.793
- Watch out, man.

20:38.793 --> 20:40.120
Your fucking bitch stole my wallet,

20:40.120 --> 20:41.220
that's what's up, man.

20:42.220 --> 20:43.420
- Maybe you're mistaken.

20:44.010 --> 20:45.280
Why don't you head back to the rig

20:45.280 --> 20:46.380
and have another look.

20:46.492 --> 20:47.325
- What the hell you talking about, man?

20:47.325 --> 20:48.420
She's a thieving whore!

20:50.324 --> 20:52.280
Okay, whoa, whoa!

20:52.280 --> 20:53.113
Whoa, whoa.

20:53.402 --> 20:55.427
Wait a minute, alright,
just wait a minute.

20:56.100 --> 20:57.300
I just want what's mine,

20:57.810 --> 20:58.880
and I'll be on my way.

20:58.880 --> 20:59.713
- Sonny.

21:00.400 --> 21:01.233
- Alright?

21:01.530 --> 21:02.780
- Now looky here, cowboy.

21:03.840 --> 21:07.223
Now I gave you a chance
to turn around, walk away.

21:08.380 --> 21:10.020
Now you're too fucking stupid

21:11.420 --> 21:13.033
or too fucking cheap to take it.

21:14.050 --> 21:15.450
Not that it matters anymore.

21:16.120 --> 21:17.180
You see, around these parts,

21:17.180 --> 21:18.880
when you fuck another man's woman,

21:20.070 --> 21:21.270
well, I get to shoot ya.

21:22.720 --> 21:23.553
Now turn around.

21:25.132 --> 21:25.965
- This ain't--

21:25.965 --> 21:26.798
- Now!

21:32.649 --> 21:33.482
- This ain't fucking right.

21:33.482 --> 21:34.943
- Yeah, it's not right.

21:35.329 --> 21:36.412
- No, no, no!

21:37.410 --> 21:38.920
Sonny, come on!

21:38.920 --> 21:41.323
He's just a dumb cowboy, come on.

21:42.462 --> 21:43.295
No, no!

21:45.892 --> 21:48.593
Why did you fucking have to do that?

21:50.924 --> 21:53.073
You make me so fucking crazy!

21:53.157 --> 21:55.123
- We gotta go, we gotta go, come on.

21:55.867 --> 21:58.837
Quit the fucking waterworks
and get in the truck.

21:59.612 --> 22:00.445
- Simon!

22:00.487 --> 22:02.183
- Get in the fucking truck!

23:47.220 --> 23:48.373
- I have to find him.

23:50.380 --> 23:52.180
- It's you I'm worried about, Freda.

23:52.290 --> 23:53.203
- I'm okay.

23:54.810 --> 23:57.490
I don't let Sonny get in here or here.

24:00.673 --> 24:03.120
But Simon ain't strong
enough to fight no more.

24:04.734 --> 24:07.043
- We're gonna need those
20 stars to save Simon.

24:07.403 --> 24:10.053
- I ain't never got close
to 20 stars in one day.

24:16.534 --> 24:18.784
- Who you talking to, niña?

24:19.393 --> 24:20.893
- I weren't talking to no one.

24:21.410 --> 24:24.110
- You're that girl
Sonny was looking for, huh?

24:24.940 --> 24:26.353
I saw you sneak in the room.

24:27.490 --> 24:29.240
- You didn't snitch on me, did you?

24:29.350 --> 24:30.413
- Of course not.

24:31.273 --> 24:32.443
The son of a bitch.

24:37.460 --> 24:39.393
Shit, shit.

24:39.610 --> 24:40.443
- Here.

24:42.750 --> 24:43.593
They're yours.

24:44.582 --> 24:45.415
I took 'em.

24:46.672 --> 24:47.839
- Look at you.

24:48.963 --> 24:50.046
Gracias, kid.

24:57.553 --> 24:58.553
- Thank you.

25:01.710 --> 25:04.373
- My momma used to tell
me, "one day, Angel,

25:04.500 --> 25:07.347
you gonna shine as
bright as that sunrise."

25:09.734 --> 25:12.003
I was going places, a dancer.

25:13.560 --> 25:15.630
Flamenco.

25:15.630 --> 25:16.873
The best around.

25:18.294 --> 25:19.294
- Is that your name?

25:19.810 --> 25:20.643
Angel?

25:23.740 --> 25:25.090
- Guess I'm a fallen angel.

25:25.930 --> 25:27.053
- Angels can't fall.

25:29.120 --> 25:33.563
They just, they just
lose their way sometimes.

25:40.090 --> 25:41.490
- You got some magic in you.

25:42.950 --> 25:44.800
Don't lose the way you see life, kid.

25:46.120 --> 25:47.670
It might just save you one day.

25:49.040 --> 25:52.083
Fuck, you might just save us all.

25:57.790 --> 25:58.623
- Hey, wait!

26:02.080 --> 26:03.123
- That's not yours.

26:04.470 --> 26:05.633
- Wasn't hers either.

26:06.360 --> 26:09.123
Unless, of course, she's Jack Wallace.

26:10.490 --> 26:12.540
- You got three stars to shine in one go.

26:13.300 --> 26:14.580
- Three stars for giving back

26:14.580 --> 26:15.903
some stolen cigarettes?

26:16.260 --> 26:18.353
- No. You gave her hope.

26:21.050 --> 26:21.883
- I did?

27:06.080 --> 27:07.380
- You find your momma yet?

27:11.622 --> 27:12.455
Guess you're gonna have to

27:12.455 --> 27:14.143
pay off your momma's tab again.

27:20.930 --> 27:24.080
I got an itch your tiny little hands

27:24.080 --> 27:26.003
can scratch real nice.

27:28.600 --> 27:30.863
Remember the last time,

27:32.350 --> 27:34.257
how nice you were to Javier?

27:35.169 --> 27:36.002
Come on.

27:36.443 --> 27:37.610
You come here.

27:37.803 --> 27:39.053
It's okay, shh.

27:44.233 --> 27:45.400
What the fuck?

27:46.000 --> 27:48.223
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

27:48.772 --> 27:50.772
- Bella? Bella, help me!

27:51.382 --> 27:52.632
Bella, help me!

27:52.907 --> 27:54.373
- Freda, I'm trying.

27:54.550 --> 27:55.913
I told you not to go in.

27:56.470 --> 27:58.393
- There's no one coming to save you, kid.

27:59.990 --> 28:00.823
- Hey, Javier?

28:00.903 --> 28:01.736
Come here.

28:03.102 --> 28:04.313
- Uh, Jack.

28:04.542 --> 28:05.642
- Have you seen Angel?

28:06.193 --> 28:07.780
Think that bitch took my wallet.

28:07.780 --> 28:08.613
- You startled me.

28:08.613 --> 28:10.613
You know what I told you about

28:11.280 --> 28:12.503
fucking used whores.

28:15.020 --> 28:15.853
- Here, kiddo,

28:15.853 --> 28:17.190
I've been looking all over for you.

28:17.923 --> 28:19.630
You, uh, you ready to get out of here?

28:19.630 --> 28:20.680
- You know this girl?

28:21.100 --> 28:22.977
- Sure, we go way back, uh, um--

28:23.483 --> 28:24.316
- Freda.

28:24.360 --> 28:25.460
- Right, Freda.

28:26.810 --> 28:28.582
Sure your mom's real worried about you,

28:28.582 --> 28:29.415
you ready to go?

28:29.870 --> 28:31.083
- Yes, definitely.

28:31.330 --> 28:32.360
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, Jack.

28:32.360 --> 28:33.360
- Easy there.

28:33.460 --> 28:34.550
- You can't, you can't
just take her, Jack.

28:34.550 --> 28:36.600
She's paying back her momma's debt to me.

28:36.718 --> 28:37.551
- I want you to run out

28:37.551 --> 28:38.384
and get in that taxicab,

28:38.384 --> 28:39.300
quick, quick like a rabbit.

28:44.230 --> 28:45.063
Do you know what we do

28:45.063 --> 28:47.103
to guys like you in prison?

28:49.010 --> 28:50.720
Guys who like to fuck little kids?

28:50.720 --> 28:53.440
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, I was not, I was--

28:53.440 --> 28:55.533
- You weren't what, you weren't what?

28:56.490 --> 28:57.500
You weren't gonna make that

28:57.500 --> 28:59.853
little cripple kid your fucking pet?

29:01.850 --> 29:02.683
Huh?

29:04.970 --> 29:06.920
- Her momma owes me three nights, Jack!

29:07.270 --> 29:08.103
- I'll be sure to tell her.

29:08.103 --> 29:09.353
- And you owe me two.

29:09.570 --> 29:12.080
- Yeah, well, now I owe ya three.

29:13.761 --> 29:15.928
- Help me, Bella, help me.

29:17.649 --> 29:18.970
- I'm here, Freda, it's okay.

29:18.970 --> 29:20.220
Just think good thoughts.

29:20.380 --> 29:21.430
- Get out of the car.

29:22.160 --> 29:23.223
Get out of the car!

29:23.990 --> 29:26.553
- Javier, you're a fucking piece of shit.

29:26.840 --> 29:29.183
- Yeah? Yeah? Okay.

29:29.950 --> 29:31.160
- You again, huh?

29:31.160 --> 29:32.060
Where are my keys?

29:33.030 --> 29:33.863
What did you do with the fuck--?

29:33.863 --> 29:35.563
- I, I didn't take your keys!

29:35.680 --> 29:36.513
- You know, I'm starting

29:36.513 --> 29:37.743
to think you're bad luck.

29:38.110 --> 29:38.943
Ahh, shit.

29:39.739 --> 29:40.783
- Get out of the car.

29:41.490 --> 29:43.340
- Hey. Hey, Javier, listen.

29:43.340 --> 29:44.793
There's no need to do this.

29:44.970 --> 29:46.830
I mean, there's a hundred

29:46.830 --> 29:48.070
cheap motels I could go to,

29:48.070 --> 29:49.503
but you know I'll come back.

29:49.940 --> 29:50.773
And if you shoot me,

29:50.773 --> 29:51.606
you get nothing outta me,

29:51.606 --> 29:53.373
you get nothing outta the kid's mom.

29:54.190 --> 29:55.590
- That's a good point, Jack.

29:57.019 --> 29:57.919
But what the fuck.

29:58.700 --> 30:00.083
I never liked you anyway.

30:01.999 --> 30:02.832
- You know what,

30:02.832 --> 30:04.915
why don't you just do it?

30:05.321 --> 30:07.463
'Cause you're gonna be
doing me a big favor.

30:10.097 --> 30:12.543
- Yeah. Goodnight, Jack.

30:12.670 --> 30:13.503
- No!

30:18.240 --> 30:19.073
- This time.

30:19.073 --> 30:19.906
- Fucking asshole.

30:19.906 --> 30:22.863
- Real shells this
time, Jack, real shells!

30:23.430 --> 30:24.593
Get out of the car.

30:24.690 --> 30:26.090
- Where are my fucking keys?

30:26.190 --> 30:27.409
- I didn't touch them.

30:27.409 --> 30:28.659
- Open the car!

30:29.367 --> 30:30.784
Come on, come on.

30:48.937 --> 30:51.287
- The thing
people don't understand,

30:52.310 --> 30:54.563
or maybe they just don't
want to understand,

30:56.470 --> 31:00.103
is that time is always chasing us.

31:02.330 --> 31:04.580
But time don't care how
much you run from it.

31:07.760 --> 31:09.170
It don't care if you want to throw

31:09.170 --> 31:10.493
all your moments away.

31:13.990 --> 31:16.220
And it don't give two
shits about any regrets

31:16.220 --> 31:18.020
you have on your last day of living.

31:22.780 --> 31:23.613
- Where are we?

31:24.900 --> 31:25.833
- In my cab.

31:32.440 --> 31:34.703
- Stan, hey, Stan, it's Jack.

31:34.820 --> 31:37.170
I'm looking for Norman
and he's not picking up.

31:37.220 --> 31:38.740
- Probably knows it's you.

31:38.740 --> 31:39.743
I can ask around.

31:40.470 --> 31:41.410
- Yeah, could you do that?

31:41.410 --> 31:42.393
It's kinda urgent.

31:43.300 --> 31:44.843
- Sure, I'll get back to you.

31:45.760 --> 31:47.383
- Hey, what the fuck?

31:47.870 --> 31:49.480
- It was on the ground at the motel.

31:49.480 --> 31:50.313
Angel dropped it.

31:50.313 --> 31:51.780
- Yeah, don't shit the shitter.

31:53.530 --> 31:54.920
- You spent it all last night,

31:54.920 --> 31:55.863
she told me.

31:56.030 --> 31:57.743
- Now you're my fucking accountant?

31:58.610 --> 31:59.680
- I'm sure it's all there,

31:59.680 --> 32:00.773
I'm no thief.

32:03.650 --> 32:04.870
If you hate me so much,

32:04.870 --> 32:05.963
why'd you save me?

32:06.900 --> 32:08.750
- Maybe because I wanted my wallet back.

32:08.750 --> 32:09.850
- You didn't know I had it.

32:09.850 --> 32:11.250
- You don't know what I saw.

32:13.060 --> 32:15.803
- You told Javier you knew my mom?

32:15.860 --> 32:17.050
- Just so I could get my wallet,

32:17.050 --> 32:17.883
kid, that's all.

32:19.410 --> 32:20.913
- You're calling me a thief,

32:21.020 --> 32:22.283
but you're a liar!

32:22.800 --> 32:24.113
You don't know my mom?

32:25.108 --> 32:27.191
- That's not what I said.

32:31.380 --> 32:33.000
- Something's wrong with that guy.

32:33.000 --> 32:34.100
- We need him.

32:47.320 --> 32:48.320
- I don't trust him.

32:49.529 --> 32:51.103
- Right now, he's all we've got.

32:52.100 --> 32:53.583
- He's not even nice.

32:55.010 --> 32:55.910
- How could he be?

32:56.967 --> 32:58.717
You saw that rope on the back seat?

33:00.530 --> 33:01.630
- Let's throw it away.

33:02.200 --> 33:03.600
- He'd just get another one.

33:04.190 --> 33:06.090
And we'd only get a couple more stars.

33:07.660 --> 33:09.260
- I think he's already given up.

33:12.480 --> 33:13.630
- He's still breathing.

33:27.018 --> 33:28.368
- So what's your game, kid?

33:28.840 --> 33:29.903
- The name's Freda.

33:30.170 --> 33:31.693
And I don't got no game.

33:32.430 --> 33:34.080
- And I'm Mother fucking Theresa.

33:37.010 --> 33:38.203
- I gotta find someone,

33:38.430 --> 33:39.480
and I need your help.

33:40.270 --> 33:42.020
- Oh, I'm supposed to
drive you around all day,

33:42.020 --> 33:43.530
I'm your fucking chauffer, that's it?

33:43.530 --> 33:45.780
Great, reach in, turn
on the meter right now.

33:45.880 --> 33:47.340
- I was gonna give your wallet back.

33:47.340 --> 33:48.883
- Before or after you paid me?

33:49.140 --> 33:50.173
With my own money.

33:50.940 --> 33:52.290
- Wouldn't get far on that.

33:54.218 --> 33:58.223
- You got that right, kid.

34:06.270 --> 34:07.103
Are you hungry?

34:11.679 --> 34:13.398
Why don't you, uh, go inside

34:13.398 --> 34:16.231
and get yourself something to eat?

34:33.996 --> 34:35.393
Oh, fuck me.

34:40.840 --> 34:41.739
- Hey, how are ya?

34:41.949 --> 34:42.929
- Good, thanks.

34:42.929 --> 34:43.763
- Two dollars.

34:52.239 --> 34:53.239
- Thank you.

34:53.339 --> 34:55.005
- Take care.

35:02.420 --> 35:04.650
- Jack, you gotta help me find Simon!

35:04.650 --> 35:06.030
He left another white marble here.

35:06.030 --> 35:07.930
- What the fuck are you talking about?

35:07.960 --> 35:09.750
- He leaves 'em when he's in trouble.

35:09.750 --> 35:11.863
He left one at the motel, and now this.

35:13.550 --> 35:14.953
Look, he was here for sure.

35:15.330 --> 35:16.790
And he won't survive
much longer at Sonny's.

35:16.790 --> 35:18.160
- Ask me if I give a shit, kid.

35:18.160 --> 35:19.303
Now give me my keys.

35:21.180 --> 35:23.023
Give me my fucking keys!

35:25.340 --> 35:26.173
Now get out,

35:26.173 --> 35:27.800
this cab's going where you're not.

35:30.720 --> 35:32.153
Go on, get out.

35:38.260 --> 35:39.143
Who's Simon?

35:40.659 --> 35:41.492
- My brother.

35:44.200 --> 35:45.813
My best friend.

35:48.670 --> 35:50.490
- Yeah, friends are hard to come by.

35:52.480 --> 35:53.793
I myself ain't got any.

35:54.110 --> 35:55.263
- That's not true.

35:56.310 --> 35:57.893
- What do you know?

35:59.493 --> 36:00.743
Hey, where are you going?

36:01.130 --> 36:02.480
- You said get out.

36:02.500 --> 36:04.450
No point in me adding to your problems.

36:04.520 --> 36:05.353
- I'm not gonna leave you here,

36:05.353 --> 36:06.680
let me drop you off in town.

36:06.830 --> 36:07.760
- Don't do me any favors.

36:07.760 --> 36:09.850
- Just get in and shut the goddamn door,

36:09.850 --> 36:11.400
will ya, you're coming with me.

36:22.910 --> 36:23.750
- Breaker, breaker.

36:23.750 --> 36:25.740
We've got Smokey on our tail.

36:25.740 --> 36:26.800
Put the hammer down.

36:26.800 --> 36:27.633
- Stop it.

36:27.720 --> 36:28.817
Put that down.

36:31.338 --> 36:32.988
They don't even say that anymore.

36:35.370 --> 36:36.203
Hey, hey.

36:37.450 --> 36:39.350
This cab is not a trash can,

36:39.350 --> 36:40.183
you understand?

36:52.920 --> 36:54.530
I know you didn't steal my wallet.

36:54.530 --> 36:55.363
- I didn't.

36:55.390 --> 36:56.530
- Didn't I just say that?

36:56.530 --> 36:57.723
Jesus Christ.

37:02.210 --> 37:04.340
Hey, I told you I'm sorry.

37:04.340 --> 37:05.183
- It's Simon.

37:07.659 --> 37:08.683
He needs me.

37:09.760 --> 37:11.933
He can't survive much longer at Sonny's.

37:14.270 --> 37:15.370
Can you take me there?

37:17.090 --> 37:18.990
- You want to walk right into Sonny's?

37:21.660 --> 37:23.410
Isn't that what he wants you to do?

37:23.700 --> 37:24.783
- You know Sonny?

37:27.850 --> 37:29.750
- Everybody in the county knows Sonny.

37:44.950 --> 37:46.617
I'm taking the keys.

37:52.380 --> 37:53.883
- This ain't gonna be so easy.

37:56.410 --> 37:57.460
- He's broken, Freda.

37:59.780 --> 38:01.380
- There's something good in him.

38:04.130 --> 38:05.580
I wish I knew what he needed.

38:12.760 --> 38:14.150
- Who were you talking to, kid?

38:14.150 --> 38:14.983
- No one.

38:21.690 --> 38:24.070
Why don't you wanna live no more?

38:25.200 --> 38:26.033
- I got reasons.

38:31.410 --> 38:32.943
- Still gonna use that rope?

38:33.690 --> 38:34.860
- I don't know.

38:37.690 --> 38:39.090
- Why ain't you done it yet?

38:39.300 --> 38:41.353
- 'Cause God's not done hating on me.

38:50.120 --> 38:51.370
I bet he and Death are having

38:51.370 --> 38:53.303
a good laugh at me right now.

38:54.560 --> 38:55.613
- Death don't laugh.

38:59.699 --> 39:01.949
- You and Death
are good friends, huh?

39:02.254 --> 39:03.123
- It chases me.

39:06.470 --> 39:07.970
- You don't think you're being

39:08.700 --> 39:10.463
just a little bit dramatic?

39:12.150 --> 39:13.250
I mean, you look like you got

39:13.250 --> 39:14.713
a few good miles left in ya.

39:18.217 --> 39:20.053
- I have 24 hours.

39:21.550 --> 39:23.343
Maybe I'll get 24 tomorrow.

39:24.878 --> 39:26.770
From the moment my eyes open,

39:26.770 --> 39:28.113
to the moment they close.

39:31.729 --> 39:32.829
That's all I ever get.

39:36.250 --> 39:37.300
- Are you dying, kid?

39:45.899 --> 39:47.816
- That's what they say.

39:53.069 --> 39:55.209
It's sad that you hate
living so much, Jack.

39:55.209 --> 39:56.709
- I don't hate it.

39:57.798 --> 39:59.048
I'm just tired.

40:02.870 --> 40:05.953
You're trying to run away from Death.

40:07.257 --> 40:09.590
I just want him to catch me.

40:11.788 --> 40:14.205
- Jack, you there?

40:14.857 --> 40:16.200
- This is Jack.

40:16.200 --> 40:17.033
What do you got?

40:17.210 --> 40:18.180
- Your idiot brother's in the

40:18.180 --> 40:19.993
nut house over in Monte Vista.

40:20.480 --> 40:21.330
- Yeah, I heard that,

40:21.330 --> 40:22.680
but do you have an address?

40:23.200 --> 40:25.470
- Yeah, 12412 Glen Oaks.

40:25.470 --> 40:26.303
- That's great.

40:26.720 --> 40:28.383
Thank you, Stan, I'm on my way.

40:29.530 --> 40:31.443
- Guess he
tried to stab someone.

40:33.629 --> 40:35.390
- I guess that means
you're not gonna help me.

40:35.390 --> 40:36.740
- I never said I was gonna.

40:39.730 --> 40:41.343
Okay. Okay, listen.

40:42.210 --> 40:43.363
I am gonna help you.

40:44.120 --> 40:45.920
But I've gotta deal with this first.

40:47.478 --> 40:48.311
- Okay.

41:18.750 --> 41:20.139
- Wait, where are you going?

41:20.139 --> 41:20.972
- With you.

41:20.972 --> 41:21.820
- No, you got no business

41:21.820 --> 41:22.903
in a place like this.

41:22.930 --> 41:24.280
- Suppose someone asks me

41:24.280 --> 41:26.123
about the rope on the back seat.

41:27.660 --> 41:29.533
- Gosh, you drive a mean bluff, kid.

41:33.960 --> 41:34.793
Hurry up.

41:40.150 --> 41:41.343
Go sit down over there.

41:41.580 --> 41:42.680
- What if you need me?

41:42.710 --> 41:43.683
- What if I don't?

41:43.690 --> 41:44.640
Go sit down.

41:47.370 --> 41:50.818
Hey, my brother, Norman
Wallace, was admitted.

41:50.818 --> 41:53.485
He may have checked in as Norma.

41:59.580 --> 42:00.620
- This ain't my first time

42:00.620 --> 42:01.970
at the nut house, you know.

42:03.168 --> 42:04.518
- Yeah, I imagine it's not.

42:05.600 --> 42:07.800
Give me 'til the big
hand hits the six, okay?

42:07.800 --> 42:09.600
- I know how to tell the time, Jack.

42:10.260 --> 42:11.360
- Great, then tell it.

42:12.019 --> 42:13.393
And don't talk to anybody.

42:21.060 --> 42:22.393
- I know what you're thinking.

42:22.620 --> 42:23.887
But Jack said to stay here.

42:23.887 --> 42:25.820
- You're no fun, Bella.

42:25.820 --> 42:27.583
He said to wait, and I am.

42:29.080 --> 42:30.450
- Freda, this is not waiting.

42:30.450 --> 42:32.283
- Sure it is, if you stay here.

43:05.310 --> 43:06.260
What are you doing?

43:07.340 --> 43:08.173
- Counting.

43:10.800 --> 43:11.633
- Counting what?

43:11.800 --> 43:12.823
- Bugs, probably.

43:13.560 --> 43:15.853
Little ones. Medium ones.

43:16.100 --> 43:19.100
Even big ones, as large as your head.

43:19.100 --> 43:20.853
- Quiet! I need quiet.

43:23.210 --> 43:24.760
Have you come to count with me?

43:26.620 --> 43:28.683
Here, in my garden.

43:29.540 --> 43:30.390
I'm the gardener.

43:32.453 --> 43:33.286
- Look.

43:36.482 --> 43:37.565
- I see them.

44:13.050 --> 44:14.833
- Where's the money, Norman?

44:15.352 --> 44:17.185
- What money?

44:18.374 --> 44:21.041
- The $8,000 that you owe Sonny.

44:25.352 --> 44:26.752
Doesn't that sound familiar?

44:27.810 --> 44:29.243
- I don't owe Sonny shit.

44:30.032 --> 44:31.632
Let the asshole come and get it.

44:32.040 --> 44:34.643
Actually, I lost it.

44:35.060 --> 44:36.683
- Are you off your fucking meds?

44:41.040 --> 44:43.090
Sonny'll kill you as soon as look at you.

44:43.230 --> 44:45.283
- Well then you gotta
get me out of here, Jack.

44:45.680 --> 44:47.530
- You stabbed a security guard, Norman.

44:47.530 --> 44:48.750
- Security guard my ass,

44:48.750 --> 44:50.030
it was one of Sonny's goons.

44:50.030 --> 44:51.300
He scared the shit out of me,

44:51.300 --> 44:52.133
I peed my skirt.

44:52.802 --> 44:54.051
And I was so humiliated,

44:54.240 --> 44:56.207
I had to cut him just a little bit.

44:56.970 --> 44:57.803
Came to collect.

44:58.760 --> 44:59.673
- Collect what?

45:00.400 --> 45:02.053
- I didn't spend it all.

45:02.350 --> 45:04.010
At least get me some clothes, Jack.

45:04.010 --> 45:05.700
They're making me wear men's trousers,

45:05.700 --> 45:06.823
can you imagine?

45:07.280 --> 45:08.113
- Where is it?

45:08.310 --> 45:09.660
- Oh, they're in my closet.

45:09.660 --> 45:11.429
A few light summer frocks, they'd be so--

45:11.429 --> 45:12.563
- The money!

45:14.660 --> 45:15.960
Where's the fucking money?

45:18.620 --> 45:19.923
- You counting flowers?

45:20.813 --> 45:22.273
- Oh no, my little dear one.

45:22.780 --> 45:24.403
To count flowers is easy.

45:26.810 --> 45:28.410
- He can see you, Bella!

45:30.927 --> 45:33.510
- It's no work to count flowers,

45:33.510 --> 45:34.563
no work at all.

45:35.140 --> 45:36.393
I count petals.

45:37.400 --> 45:41.640
Two thousand and four,
two thousand and five...

45:42.270 --> 45:45.283
Every petal has its own smell.

45:45.520 --> 45:48.720
Aroma. Flavor.

45:48.720 --> 45:49.993
Try it! Smell!

45:54.050 --> 45:55.900
- Mine smells like chocolate cookies.

45:57.760 --> 45:58.743
- Mm, bubblegum!

46:03.880 --> 46:06.783
- This is petal two thousand and ten,

46:07.300 --> 46:09.000
and petal two thousand and eleven.

46:10.872 --> 46:12.443
And they chose to be with you.

46:13.912 --> 46:15.403
Now you keep them safe.

46:16.190 --> 46:17.363
You're their home now.

46:30.450 --> 46:32.400
- No, Freda, don't even think about it.

46:41.460 --> 46:43.233
- You need to accept me, Jack.

46:43.570 --> 46:44.803
Please call me Norma.

46:45.470 --> 46:46.303
- You're a man.

46:48.020 --> 46:49.793
At least some part of you still is.

46:50.120 --> 46:51.740
- You never understood

46:51.780 --> 46:54.463
anything about me, Jackie.

46:54.960 --> 46:56.310
- Don't ever call me that.

46:56.310 --> 46:58.803
- Momma used to love that name for you.

46:59.170 --> 47:00.970
Jackie and Norma,
sitting pretty in a tree.

47:00.970 --> 47:02.060
- My name's Jack!

47:05.109 --> 47:05.942
- Hiya.

47:07.080 --> 47:08.733
- She's beautiful, Jack.

47:09.390 --> 47:10.613
A bit young, though.

47:11.030 --> 47:11.863
Even for you.

47:15.760 --> 47:16.680
- Goddammit, kid.

47:16.680 --> 47:17.700
If you can't listen to me,

47:17.700 --> 47:19.450
you've got to hit the goddamn road.

47:19.490 --> 47:20.323
- I'm sorry, Jack,

47:20.323 --> 47:21.740
but you have to let me help you.

47:21.740 --> 47:23.730
- You're 20 years too late.

47:23.730 --> 47:26.133
Now go find someone else to save.

47:35.750 --> 47:37.523
You're in real deep shit, Norman.

47:40.980 --> 47:42.580
Sonny is gonna kill you,

47:42.580 --> 47:44.183
sooner rather than later.

47:44.480 --> 47:46.273
Well, do something, you owe me.

47:46.340 --> 47:48.323
- How the fuck do I owe you?

47:48.950 --> 47:49.930
- Who took care of Mom

47:49.930 --> 47:51.280
when you were incarcerated?

47:51.480 --> 47:52.980
You think I could afford a nursing home

47:52.980 --> 47:54.443
when her dementia got so bad?

47:56.320 --> 47:58.903
I had to watch her die, not you.

48:00.072 --> 48:01.483
And it wasn't quick.

48:06.340 --> 48:07.173
- Okay.

48:07.820 --> 48:08.970
- What're you gonna do.

48:10.660 --> 48:11.710
- I'm gonna take what's left

48:11.710 --> 48:13.110
of the money back to Sonny,

48:13.110 --> 48:14.580
and I'm gonna try to convince him

48:14.580 --> 48:15.723
to leave you alone.

48:20.300 --> 48:22.563
But, after that, I'm done, Norman.

48:22.610 --> 48:25.493
- Okay. No need to go
all Norma Desmond on me.

48:25.660 --> 48:27.570
- I don't even know what that means.

48:35.522 --> 48:36.673
- What are you doing here?

48:37.000 --> 48:37.983
- Just visiting.

48:38.040 --> 48:39.510
- So where's your badge, honey?

48:39.510 --> 48:41.813
Okay, we have another
runner from the kids unit!

48:42.024 --> 48:44.317
- What are you, what are you doing?

48:44.317 --> 48:46.234
No, stop! Let go of me!

48:47.482 --> 48:48.703
- Honey, I need you to stay still, okay?

48:49.112 --> 48:50.362
- Let go of me!

48:50.864 --> 48:55.393
Stop! Stop!

48:55.580 --> 48:56.810
- I need you to calm down.

48:56.810 --> 48:57.643
- No!

48:58.257 --> 48:59.517
- Or you're gonna get the sleepy needle.

49:01.322 --> 49:02.493
- I need you to calm down.

49:03.211 --> 49:04.651
Calm down, sweetie, calm down.

49:04.651 --> 49:05.901
- Bella! Bella!

49:06.141 --> 49:07.224
Bella! Bella!

49:09.653 --> 49:10.533
- Help, do something.

49:10.533 --> 49:12.116
Freda's in trouble.

49:14.058 --> 49:17.808
- No! No! My petals!

49:21.512 --> 49:22.429
- Security!

49:26.032 --> 49:28.032
I need you to calm down.

49:30.202 --> 49:32.040
- Ahh! Two thousand sixty five!

49:32.040 --> 49:33.453
Two thousand sixty six!

49:36.090 --> 49:37.003
- Stop, stop!

49:37.250 --> 49:38.472
- Wait a minute, what the--

49:38.472 --> 49:39.983
What the hell are you doing?

49:39.983 --> 49:41.316
- Stop! Stop it!

49:44.082 --> 49:45.282
- She belongs in the kids unit.

49:45.282 --> 49:47.115
- She belongs with me.

49:55.860 --> 49:57.750
- Nice job, Bella. Thanks.

49:57.750 --> 49:59.253
- You shoulda listened to him.

49:59.440 --> 50:00.590
What if he hadn't come?

50:01.180 --> 50:02.013
- Well, he did.

50:02.013 --> 50:03.943
But we still need him.

50:18.600 --> 50:19.750
- Put your seatbelt on.

50:28.800 --> 50:29.853
- I'm sorry, Jack.

50:31.371 --> 50:33.160
- God, I don't have time for this shit.

50:33.160 --> 50:34.560
- He's not going to help us.

50:34.710 --> 50:35.793
- That's not true.

50:36.610 --> 50:37.860
- Who are you talking to?

50:40.830 --> 50:42.173
- Where are we going?

50:42.762 --> 50:45.083
- I gotta pick something
up from Norman's trailer.

50:45.230 --> 50:46.830
- You said you'd help me find Simon.

50:46.830 --> 50:47.960
- Well, if Simon's with Sonny,

50:47.960 --> 50:49.010
then it's your lucky day,

50:49.010 --> 50:50.610
'cause that's where we're going.

50:53.010 --> 50:55.643
Norman owes Sonny some
money, a lot of money.

50:57.300 --> 50:59.400
Gonna figure out how to smooth things out.

51:11.490 --> 51:12.740
- How do you know my mom?

51:15.460 --> 51:16.293
- I was just saying that

51:16.293 --> 51:17.580
to get you out of the motel.

51:18.970 --> 51:19.803
- No, he wasn't.

51:21.760 --> 51:23.043
- I don't believe you.

51:24.050 --> 51:25.633
- Alright, so I know your mom.

51:27.550 --> 51:28.723
It was a long time ago.

51:30.660 --> 51:32.020
Your mom's got this real knack

51:32.020 --> 51:33.643
for fucking people over.

51:34.240 --> 51:35.963
Making people clean up her shit.

51:37.270 --> 51:39.533
Especially people that love her.

51:42.180 --> 51:43.493
- You loved my mom?

51:44.140 --> 51:46.140
- She was a lot different.

51:47.270 --> 51:48.863
- What did she do to you?

51:49.063 --> 51:50.663
- I don't wanna talk about that.

52:01.570 --> 52:03.773
- Simon's had it a lot worse than me.

52:05.330 --> 52:07.453
He can't handle Wanda's crazy.

52:08.650 --> 52:09.483
- You can?

52:10.400 --> 52:11.800
- Better than Simon.

52:15.570 --> 52:16.870
- So you take care of him.

52:19.640 --> 52:20.473
- I try.

52:23.130 --> 52:24.413
- Who takes care of you?

52:31.271 --> 52:33.047
- Well, today it's you.

53:01.150 --> 53:02.470
- I don't think this is a good idea.

53:02.470 --> 53:03.523
- Got a better one?

53:04.540 --> 53:06.040
Just leave the thinking to me.

53:06.220 --> 53:07.270
And you gotta promise me

53:07.270 --> 53:08.520
you'll stay out of sight.

53:08.650 --> 53:10.623
I don't wanna end up in the nut house.

53:11.300 --> 53:12.193
Like Norman.

53:12.770 --> 53:14.043
- I'm only trying to help.

53:14.310 --> 53:15.143
- I know.

53:17.620 --> 53:18.550
Without you, we'll never

53:18.550 --> 53:20.113
get those 20 good luck stars.

53:20.450 --> 53:22.510
- You just got two more from the Gardener.

53:22.510 --> 53:23.430
- But he helped us.

53:23.430 --> 53:25.143
- You made his day.

53:25.560 --> 53:27.023
Actually, his whole week.

53:28.210 --> 53:29.560
You're not mad at me, then?

53:29.860 --> 53:30.693
- No.

53:31.530 --> 53:32.603
I love you, Bella.

53:33.570 --> 53:34.770
I'd be lost without you.

53:37.350 --> 53:38.183
- Hey, you okay?

53:41.780 --> 53:42.780
- Everything's fine.

53:44.000 --> 53:44.833
- Who's Bella?

53:45.853 --> 53:47.543
- I don't know what you're talking about.

53:57.330 --> 53:59.173
It ain't been cleaned for weeks.

53:59.920 --> 54:00.903
- Try years, kid.

54:02.372 --> 54:03.205
- Ugh.

54:08.920 --> 54:10.093
It's okay, Jack.

54:12.093 --> 54:13.593
- I abandoned him.

54:17.200 --> 54:18.033
I left him.

54:19.984 --> 54:21.434
- But you're helping him now.

54:22.630 --> 54:23.580
- I'm all he's got.

54:26.040 --> 54:27.383
- Norman doesn't hate you.

54:28.988 --> 54:31.943
He just wants you to love him.

54:33.140 --> 54:34.740
And every day's a new day, Jack.

54:36.810 --> 54:38.510
- How old did you say you are?

54:38.510 --> 54:39.460
- I'm 11 years old.

54:41.744 --> 54:45.077
- Holy shit.

54:50.282 --> 54:52.532
- You look like a princess.

55:02.030 --> 55:05.013
- Well, help an old princess up, will ya?

55:07.693 --> 55:09.443
Oh yeah, that's good.

55:09.827 --> 55:12.173
- Maybe you should do it a few more times.

55:13.670 --> 55:15.231
- Let's you and me find this money

55:15.231 --> 55:16.523
and get the hell out of here.

55:24.760 --> 55:26.960
- So while you're giving
the money to Sonny,

55:27.060 --> 55:28.387
Simon and I can sneak out?

55:29.213 --> 55:31.880
- I, uh, I don't really

55:31.880 --> 55:33.630
have any details worked out, kiddo.

55:41.561 --> 55:44.061
- This how much he owes Sonny?

55:47.563 --> 55:49.053
- A lot more than this.

55:57.142 --> 55:57.980
You know, that hooker had

55:57.980 --> 55:59.893
a good laugh at me last night,

56:00.110 --> 56:01.233
'cause I was broke.

56:03.160 --> 56:05.070
I guess she wouldn't be laughing now, huh?

56:05.070 --> 56:06.883
- Her name is Angel.

56:08.150 --> 56:09.790
- All hookers are named Angel, kiddo.

56:09.790 --> 56:10.940
- That's her real name.

56:13.272 --> 56:15.072
And I doubt she was laughing at you.

56:16.880 --> 56:19.293
She was probably pissed
about something else.

56:19.440 --> 56:20.990
- All women seem to get pissed at me

56:20.990 --> 56:23.113
for some reason or another eventually.

56:23.160 --> 56:23.993
- Not Angel.

56:25.860 --> 56:27.063
She has her own dreams.

56:27.450 --> 56:28.700
- Oh yeah, is that right?

56:29.120 --> 56:30.993
- She used to be a flamenco dancer.

56:32.242 --> 56:33.563
Bet you didn't know that, huh?

56:33.563 --> 56:35.423
- No, it didn't come up.

56:38.760 --> 56:40.310
- You think that I'm heartless.

56:41.700 --> 56:43.513
- People's hearts are fragile.

56:45.150 --> 56:47.523
Especially those who ain't seen by others.

56:48.700 --> 56:50.773
- She's been seen by plenty of people.

56:50.992 --> 56:53.980
- Doing that and seeing someone

56:54.080 --> 56:55.463
are not the same thing.

56:59.940 --> 57:00.773
- Oh shit.

57:03.082 --> 57:04.310
Sonny's not gonna wait for me

57:04.310 --> 57:05.980
to bring him the money.

57:05.980 --> 57:07.717
Come on, get in the bathroom.

57:11.972 --> 57:12.805
- Norman!

57:14.253 --> 57:15.503
- Listen to me.

57:15.624 --> 57:17.040
Hide under the trailer, take the money,

57:17.040 --> 57:18.672
do not come out until I tell you.

57:18.672 --> 57:19.505
- Okay.

57:19.505 --> 57:20.338
- Got it?

57:20.338 --> 57:21.171
- Okay.

57:21.171 --> 57:22.004
- Go!

57:22.004 --> 57:22.837
- Norman!

57:22.837 --> 57:24.087
- He's in here.

57:24.120 --> 57:24.953
- Open the door!

57:27.783 --> 57:28.690
- Where's the fucking money?

57:28.690 --> 57:29.833
- What fucking money?

57:31.539 --> 57:33.107
Ow, Jesus Christ!

57:39.333 --> 57:41.000
- The fucking money!

57:50.722 --> 57:52.055
- Where are you?

57:52.612 --> 57:54.112
- Jack! Jack Jack!

57:57.020 --> 57:59.020
- He's got that little cripple with him.

58:02.095 --> 58:02.928
- Stay down!

58:02.928 --> 58:03.973
- No! You loco, homes?

58:03.973 --> 58:05.040
That's Sonny's prize bitch!

58:05.040 --> 58:05.873
Come on.

58:07.410 --> 58:08.460
- Are you hit?

58:08.722 --> 58:13.722
- Yeah.

58:19.722 --> 58:20.555
- Let me see.

58:22.890 --> 58:24.590
Barely nicked you, you'll be okay.

58:28.373 --> 58:30.423
Oh my God, I'm sorry I got you into this.

58:30.980 --> 58:32.183
- I've had worse days.

58:34.820 --> 58:36.023
Just take me to Simon.

58:36.720 --> 58:38.577
- We gotta lay low for a minute.

58:40.672 --> 58:42.163
I'm starving, are you hungry?

58:54.824 --> 58:57.574
- What are we doing here?

58:57.900 --> 58:59.450
- We gotta hide the car.

59:24.282 --> 59:25.432
What about Bella?

59:25.432 --> 59:26.432
She gonna be hungry?

59:29.780 --> 59:31.480
Why don't you introduce me to her?

59:31.630 --> 59:33.710
Is she busy counting your lucky stars?

59:33.710 --> 59:34.853
- Shut up, Jack.

59:35.390 --> 59:36.400
It's rude to listen to

59:36.400 --> 59:38.143
other people's conversations.

59:38.300 --> 59:39.400
- Hey, it's okay, kid.

59:40.730 --> 59:41.670
There's a lot of people

59:41.670 --> 59:42.900
who have imaginary friends.

59:42.900 --> 59:44.893
- She's not imaginary.

59:45.250 --> 59:46.083
- Okay.

59:48.880 --> 59:50.673
- I just don't let anybody see her.

59:52.660 --> 59:53.510
- Why not?

59:54.860 --> 59:56.113
- I don't trust anyone.

01:00:00.862 --> 01:00:01.990
- How about lunch?

01:00:01.990 --> 01:00:03.390
- I'll eat anything.

01:00:03.630 --> 01:00:05.880
- Hey, can we get two
lunch specials, please?

01:00:11.160 --> 01:00:14.873
- So what happened between you and my mom?

01:00:15.630 --> 01:00:16.770
- You're too young to understand

01:00:16.770 --> 01:00:18.260
what happened between me and your mom.

01:00:18.260 --> 01:00:21.003
- I'm the oldest 11 year
old you'll ever meet.

01:00:24.740 --> 01:00:26.440
- Since I was knee-high to a grasshopper,

01:00:26.440 --> 01:00:27.290
I loved your mom.

01:00:27.750 --> 01:00:29.000
I just couldn't quit her.

01:00:30.940 --> 01:00:33.093
Even once her stepdad started to, uh...

01:00:35.920 --> 01:00:38.271
Well, let's just say he
wasn't a very good man.

01:00:38.271 --> 01:00:39.453
- He was an asshole.

01:00:41.280 --> 01:00:43.123
He pimped her out.

01:00:44.242 --> 01:00:45.075
- Yeah.

01:00:48.910 --> 01:00:51.077
And then Sonny came along.

01:00:52.750 --> 01:00:54.500
Took her away on all those...

01:00:55.030 --> 01:00:56.023
- Vacations?

01:00:58.200 --> 01:00:59.300
I know all about them.

01:01:02.980 --> 01:01:04.380
- Did he do that to you too?

01:01:09.120 --> 01:01:09.953
- Yeah.

01:01:18.750 --> 01:01:19.650
- You know, I figured

01:01:19.650 --> 01:01:21.213
I'd just never see her again.

01:01:22.410 --> 01:01:24.363
But then a couple years later,

01:01:25.870 --> 01:01:27.023
there she was.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:32.103
She just looked like a wounded dog.

01:01:33.100 --> 01:01:34.650
Trapped in this motel,

01:01:34.650 --> 01:01:38.563
all strung out on all sorts of shit.

01:01:41.582 --> 01:01:42.723
She was only 16.

01:01:45.260 --> 01:01:48.410
So one night, while Sonny was out,

01:01:48.410 --> 01:01:49.973
she and I just ran.

01:01:52.220 --> 01:01:54.170
You know, I thought I could outrun him.

01:01:55.370 --> 01:01:57.823
And that we would just start a new life.

01:02:01.784 --> 01:02:03.643
And I helped her get clean,

01:02:04.170 --> 01:02:05.733
and then she got pregnant.

01:02:08.480 --> 01:02:09.313
- Dylan.

01:02:12.490 --> 01:02:13.323
- What?

01:02:15.088 --> 01:02:16.088
- That was his name.

01:02:18.410 --> 01:02:19.810
The baby the two of you had.

01:02:22.080 --> 01:02:23.623
My older brother I never met.

01:02:25.880 --> 01:02:26.713
- Is he alive?

01:02:31.470 --> 01:02:32.303
- No.

01:02:35.010 --> 01:02:37.633
Um, my mom said he died of SIDS.

01:02:38.780 --> 01:02:39.743
But it was a lie.

01:02:41.580 --> 01:02:43.260
My grandmother put her in the nut house

01:02:43.260 --> 01:02:45.210
because the cops were going after them.

01:02:49.107 --> 01:02:52.880
They figured she or Sonny killed the baby.

01:02:57.590 --> 01:02:58.803
I'm so sorry, Jack.

01:03:03.730 --> 01:03:04.563
- Dylan?

01:03:10.430 --> 01:03:12.280
- What happened to you, Jack?

01:03:15.430 --> 01:03:17.713
- Sonny has a bastard cop brother.

01:03:19.840 --> 01:03:21.363
And they tracked us down.

01:03:23.050 --> 01:03:24.463
And your mom lied.

01:03:26.920 --> 01:03:28.970
She told 'em that I kidnapped her.

01:03:28.970 --> 01:03:29.950
And raped her.

01:03:29.950 --> 01:03:31.283
So I went to prison.

01:03:33.900 --> 01:03:34.733
For a lie.

01:03:41.330 --> 01:03:43.063
After all the shit she's done to you,

01:03:43.063 --> 01:03:44.723
I do not know how you do it.

01:03:46.190 --> 01:03:47.440
You dying and everything.

01:03:48.521 --> 01:03:49.873
- Yes, I'm dying.

01:03:52.090 --> 01:03:53.493
But not today, Jack.

01:03:55.550 --> 01:03:56.880
- You found a way to live.

01:03:57.490 --> 01:03:58.657
- You can too.

01:04:04.384 --> 01:04:05.301
Jack? Jack!

01:04:06.224 --> 01:04:07.624
You gotta listen to me.

01:04:07.624 --> 01:04:08.773
You're my only chance--

01:04:08.773 --> 01:04:09.606
- To what?

01:04:09.606 --> 01:04:10.523
To what, kid?

01:04:11.070 --> 01:04:13.233
To get your good luck stars?

01:04:31.990 --> 01:04:33.833
I don't understand you, kid.

01:04:35.740 --> 01:04:37.540
You, it seems like

01:04:37.540 --> 01:04:38.373
you've got nothing to live for

01:04:38.373 --> 01:04:40.173
and all you want is life?

01:04:43.730 --> 01:04:44.760
I mean, you're right.

01:04:44.760 --> 01:04:45.813
It's a choice.

01:04:46.230 --> 01:04:48.883
To open up your heart to people.

01:04:50.590 --> 01:04:52.773
But life gets hard when
you get older, kid.

01:04:52.980 --> 01:04:54.240
It doesn't seem like it should,

01:04:54.240 --> 01:04:55.657
but it gets so--

01:04:56.240 --> 01:04:57.073
- You're so caught up in

01:04:57.073 --> 01:04:58.553
feeling sorry for yourself.

01:05:06.806 --> 01:05:11.043
You're missing all your precious moments.

01:05:22.126 --> 01:05:25.626
Look, this one's almost found its destiny.

01:05:32.710 --> 01:05:34.263
- A dandelion has a destiny?

01:05:36.260 --> 01:05:37.843
- To become a wishing flower.

01:05:41.590 --> 01:05:42.540
- A wishing flower.

01:06:06.682 --> 01:06:08.099
- He made a wish.

01:06:09.711 --> 01:06:10.544
- Yeah?

01:07:10.073 --> 01:07:11.373
- What are we doing, Jack?

01:07:12.280 --> 01:07:13.113
It's Bella.

01:07:17.391 --> 01:07:20.974
- No, she doesn't let
anybody else see you.

01:07:22.140 --> 01:07:24.713
- Yes, she'll probably be mad.

01:07:28.170 --> 01:07:30.573
She's never made it past
seven stars in one day.

01:07:32.040 --> 01:07:33.423
She needs a whole lot more.

01:07:34.090 --> 01:07:36.190
- What happens if you don't get the stars?

01:07:36.450 --> 01:07:38.963
- Her nightmare will never end.

01:07:41.700 --> 01:07:43.003
- She deserves better.

01:07:43.470 --> 01:07:45.470
- Yes, but she can't always see

01:07:45.470 --> 01:07:46.563
the beauty of life.

01:07:47.140 --> 01:07:48.281
- She sees more beauty

01:07:48.281 --> 01:07:49.570
than anybody I've ever met.

01:07:49.570 --> 01:07:51.023
- She's trapped, Jack.

01:07:51.650 --> 01:07:52.763
Just like you.

01:07:53.630 --> 01:07:55.233
Only you can help her now.

01:07:58.090 --> 01:07:59.590
- I thought that was your job.

01:08:02.110 --> 01:08:03.510
- I can't help her any more.

01:08:05.152 --> 01:08:06.252
- Jesus Christ.

01:08:14.150 --> 01:08:15.094
- You're not going to do

01:08:15.094 --> 01:08:16.926
anything bad, are you?

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.167
Don't do it, Jack, please!

01:08:30.380 --> 01:08:31.950
- Bella, you promised me you--

01:08:31.950 --> 01:08:34.050
- I had to, Freda, he's our last chance!

01:08:34.050 --> 01:08:35.109
Don't go in there!

01:08:35.109 --> 01:08:36.493
- Our last chance?

01:08:37.010 --> 01:08:38.109
You just said you weren't

01:08:38.109 --> 01:08:39.423
gonna help me any more.

01:08:40.859 --> 01:08:41.930
- Run, Freda, you gotta get away.

01:08:41.930 --> 01:08:43.479
Something bad is going to happen.

01:08:43.479 --> 01:08:44.340
- Get lost, Bella.

01:08:44.340 --> 01:08:45.483
You're not even real.

01:08:45.689 --> 01:08:47.540
- I am so real, you've always said so!

01:08:47.540 --> 01:08:49.330
- The Easter Bunny is more real than you.

01:08:49.330 --> 01:08:50.923
- No, I save you.

01:08:51.180 --> 01:08:52.653
- I don't need you any more.

01:08:56.100 --> 01:08:56.979
You're just a figment

01:08:56.979 --> 01:08:58.792
of my fucked-up imagination.

01:09:14.580 --> 01:09:17.173
- Hey! Look what we got here.

01:09:17.399 --> 01:09:18.453
It's Trailer Trash.

01:09:19.500 --> 01:09:20.649
- Sonny's expecting me.

01:09:20.821 --> 01:09:23.981
- Oh yeah?

01:09:34.609 --> 01:09:35.443
- Freda!

01:09:37.620 --> 01:09:38.683
Yeah, it's me.

01:09:39.210 --> 01:09:41.173
- Simon, what are you doing here?

01:09:48.500 --> 01:09:49.700
- Alright, back to work.

01:09:53.721 --> 01:09:55.213
- Look what el gato dragged in.

01:09:56.512 --> 01:09:57.412
- What's up, Jack?

01:09:58.510 --> 01:10:00.410
- I wanna make a deal with you, Sonny.

01:10:00.640 --> 01:10:02.263
- Oh, we already got a deal.

01:10:04.500 --> 01:10:05.333
Where is she?

01:10:06.460 --> 01:10:07.433
Where's my girl at?

01:10:09.260 --> 01:10:10.360
He's got her with him.

01:10:24.030 --> 01:10:25.380
- This was a set-up, Freda.

01:10:26.880 --> 01:10:27.713
- By who?

01:10:28.370 --> 01:10:29.653
- Mom and Sonny.

01:10:30.660 --> 01:10:31.890
When they couldn't find you at the motel,

01:10:31.890 --> 01:10:34.373
they had some guy bring you here.

01:10:35.410 --> 01:10:36.243
- Jack?

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:37.833
- I think so.

01:10:39.120 --> 01:10:40.590
I heard Sonny talking to him on the phone,

01:10:40.590 --> 01:10:43.283
saying that if he brought you,

01:10:43.990 --> 01:10:45.180
he could keep some of the money

01:10:45.180 --> 01:10:46.623
and save his brother.

01:10:46.960 --> 01:10:48.270
This guy goes a long ways back

01:10:48.270 --> 01:10:49.263
with Mom and Sonny.

01:10:49.920 --> 01:10:51.183
Sounds like a creep.

01:10:51.500 --> 01:10:52.853
- Jack would never do that.

01:10:53.860 --> 01:10:54.753
- Why not?

01:10:55.440 --> 01:10:56.883
- Simon, he just wouldn't.

01:10:57.560 --> 01:10:59.360
- You always see the best in people.

01:10:59.930 --> 01:11:01.623
But sometimes people disappoint.

01:11:02.020 --> 01:11:03.720
- Jack saved my life so many times

01:11:03.720 --> 01:11:04.870
when he didn't have to.

01:11:05.220 --> 01:11:06.820
- Of course, he was playing you.

01:11:19.057 --> 01:11:20.849
- Get the fuck over here!

01:11:20.849 --> 01:11:23.712
Don't let that motherfucker get away.

01:11:39.352 --> 01:11:41.185
- No, leave him alone!

01:11:42.610 --> 01:11:44.277
No, leave him alone!

01:11:45.570 --> 01:11:46.403
Simon!

01:11:48.510 --> 01:11:50.010
No, no, no! Simon!

01:11:53.471 --> 01:11:56.150
- You got a ton of women
working for you, Sonny.

01:11:56.150 --> 01:11:57.160
You don't need Freda.

01:11:57.160 --> 01:11:58.593
She's just a kid.

01:11:59.150 --> 01:12:00.530
- If I wanted business advice from you,

01:12:00.530 --> 01:12:01.853
Jack, I'd ask.

01:12:02.150 --> 01:12:03.850
- What do you care about it, Jack?

01:12:04.650 --> 01:12:06.060
You're the one willing to bounty hunt

01:12:06.060 --> 01:12:08.203
my cripple kid for some chump change.

01:12:09.110 --> 01:12:10.593
You're so weak, Jack.

01:12:13.100 --> 01:12:13.933
You'd think prison would have

01:12:13.933 --> 01:12:15.493
grown you a fucking spine.

01:12:18.110 --> 01:12:19.467
- I don't want the money.

01:12:20.253 --> 01:12:21.593
You can keep it all.

01:12:22.660 --> 01:12:25.003
Give me Freda and her brother.

01:12:25.672 --> 01:12:27.072
Then you never see me again.

01:12:27.320 --> 01:12:29.090
- Just take the fucking money.

01:12:29.781 --> 01:12:31.581
I mean, this should be easy for you.

01:12:32.170 --> 01:12:34.420
And don't you wanna save
your faggot brother?

01:12:36.730 --> 01:12:38.687
- Keep your blood money, Sonny.

01:12:38.860 --> 01:12:40.290
- Let go of me, you jerk!

01:12:40.290 --> 01:12:42.320
Put me down, you caveman!

01:12:42.320 --> 01:12:43.519
I'm gonna kill you!

01:12:43.519 --> 01:12:44.570
- Thanks, Jack.

01:12:44.570 --> 01:12:45.690
Pick up your fucking money.

01:12:45.690 --> 01:12:46.760
- I'm gonna kill you!

01:12:46.760 --> 01:12:47.593
- My pet.

01:12:48.390 --> 01:12:49.223
- Don't!

01:12:52.192 --> 01:12:53.025
No! Freda!

01:12:53.341 --> 01:12:54.174
Freda.

01:12:54.174 --> 01:12:55.490
- Wasn't it nice of Jack to bring you

01:12:55.490 --> 01:12:57.320
all safe and sound back to me?

01:12:57.330 --> 01:12:58.980
Get a little piece along the way?

01:12:59.220 --> 01:13:00.280
- This is not what it looks like

01:13:00.280 --> 01:13:01.113
to you, I promise.

01:13:01.113 --> 01:13:02.410
- You brought me here for money?

01:13:02.600 --> 01:13:03.433
- No!

01:13:03.711 --> 01:13:04.900
- You said you were
gonna help me find Simon!

01:13:04.900 --> 01:13:08.183
- Freda. Oh God, I fucked up so bad.

01:13:08.240 --> 01:13:10.493
- Oh, stop your fucking whining, Jack.

01:13:11.150 --> 01:13:12.660
She might be lame and dying,

01:13:12.660 --> 01:13:13.933
but she ain't stupid.

01:13:14.820 --> 01:13:18.193
- I was gonna do it. I was.

01:13:19.310 --> 01:13:21.260
But I saw how beautiful your heart works,

01:13:21.260 --> 01:13:23.510
and how you treat the rest of us,

01:13:23.510 --> 01:13:25.510
even though we don't fucking deserve it.

01:13:25.740 --> 01:13:28.190
- Your words are as good
as shit in a pail, Jack.

01:13:28.500 --> 01:13:29.963
- I've had enough lies!

01:13:30.060 --> 01:13:32.293
You sold me like the rest of them.

01:13:32.400 --> 01:13:34.853
Only worse, 'cause I
thought you were my friend.

01:13:35.430 --> 01:13:36.593
I wanted to help you.

01:13:36.940 --> 01:13:38.783
And now I can never forgive you.

01:13:38.990 --> 01:13:40.053
Not ever!

01:13:41.330 --> 01:13:42.630
- Well, there it is, Jack.

01:13:44.450 --> 01:13:45.929
Ain't it a fucking shame
when those you love

01:13:45.929 --> 01:13:47.629
just ain't got no more use for ya?

01:13:49.120 --> 01:13:51.070
Little bitch just ain't worth it, Jack.

01:13:51.901 --> 01:13:52.734
- Don't!

01:13:54.920 --> 01:13:56.603
- Don't touch me, Jack!

01:13:57.260 --> 01:13:59.270
- I'm still breathing, Freda.

01:14:04.333 --> 01:14:06.283
- You're a stupid piece of shit, Sonny!

01:14:07.620 --> 01:14:09.100
Go ahead and kill me, Sonny,

01:14:09.100 --> 01:14:10.513
you've done everything else!

01:14:10.780 --> 01:14:11.760
But it's nothing as to

01:14:11.760 --> 01:14:13.223
what you've done to Simon.

01:14:14.450 --> 01:14:15.563
But just so you know,

01:14:16.280 --> 01:14:18.143
you'll never get in here,

01:14:19.020 --> 01:14:21.823
and you'll never, ever touch my heart.

01:14:23.430 --> 01:14:24.933
And you'll never be loved.

01:14:25.610 --> 01:14:26.963
By anyone, Sonny.

01:14:27.310 --> 01:14:28.653
- That's not true.

01:14:29.160 --> 01:14:30.223
I love you, Sonny.

01:14:30.480 --> 01:14:31.533
- Shut up, you whore.

01:14:32.600 --> 01:14:34.413
- I don't care what you've done to me.

01:14:35.160 --> 01:14:36.113
It doesn't matter.

01:14:37.110 --> 01:14:37.943
But you're not doing

01:14:37.943 --> 01:14:39.573
a damn thing more to those kids.

01:14:40.080 --> 01:14:41.223
I am taking them,

01:14:41.710 --> 01:14:43.610
and I'm walking out of here right now.

01:14:47.310 --> 01:14:49.290
- Come on, kill the
son of a bitch already.

01:14:49.290 --> 01:14:50.240
- Smoke him, Sonny.

01:14:51.112 --> 01:14:52.721
- That's a promise you
ain't gonna keep, Jack.

01:14:52.721 --> 01:14:53.554
- I believe in you, Jack!

01:14:53.554 --> 01:14:54.387
I always will!

01:15:27.621 --> 01:15:28.704
- Freda, run!

01:15:30.961 --> 01:15:31.794
- No!

01:15:35.991 --> 01:15:38.723
Jack! Jack!

01:15:40.800 --> 01:15:41.633
Don't die.

01:15:42.230 --> 01:15:43.783
Please, please don't die.

01:15:44.151 --> 01:15:46.484
- I never meant to harm you.

01:15:46.650 --> 01:15:47.897
I messed up really bad.

01:15:50.802 --> 01:15:52.417
Will you forgive me?

01:15:52.417 --> 01:15:54.320
- Yes, yes! Of course, Jack!

01:15:54.320 --> 01:15:56.533
- Am I worthy of being forgiven?

01:15:57.360 --> 01:15:58.860
- You're worthy of love, Jack.

01:16:00.880 --> 01:16:01.730
- Let's go, gimp.

01:16:01.790 --> 01:16:02.993
You got work to do.

01:16:03.131 --> 01:16:03.964
- No!

01:16:04.013 --> 01:16:04.846
- Ain't nobody coming to help you,

01:16:04.846 --> 01:16:05.679
you little cunt.

01:16:06.930 --> 01:16:07.900
I got a high-paying sicko

01:16:07.900 --> 01:16:09.850
just waiting for your sweet little ass.

01:16:10.670 --> 01:16:11.553
You belong to me.

01:16:11.790 --> 01:16:13.640
- My sister will never belong to you.

01:16:14.160 --> 01:16:15.173
You fucker!

01:16:17.853 --> 01:16:18.853
- No, Sonny!

01:16:21.362 --> 01:16:22.612
No, no, no, no.

01:16:25.490 --> 01:16:26.323
- Simon!

01:16:28.301 --> 01:16:29.218
- You okay?

01:16:29.602 --> 01:16:30.435
- Yes.

01:16:32.140 --> 01:16:33.513
You came just in time.

01:16:37.092 --> 01:16:40.333
- I killed him, didn't I?

01:16:40.932 --> 01:16:42.653
- You did what you had to do.

01:16:42.653 --> 01:16:44.043
He didn't give you a choice, kid.

01:16:54.712 --> 01:16:56.412
- Jack, this is my brother, Simon.

01:16:58.900 --> 01:16:59.850
- Hi, Jack.

01:17:02.030 --> 01:17:03.730
- You were right about him, Simon.

01:17:04.090 --> 01:17:04.923
And wrong.

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:07.053
- More wrong, I hope.

01:17:07.320 --> 01:17:09.943
- Yes, definitely more wrong.

01:17:12.018 --> 01:17:14.680
- Please, Sonny, no!

01:17:20.890 --> 01:17:22.293
- I hope the fucker dies.

01:17:23.100 --> 01:17:24.950
- You ain't gonna get away with this.

01:17:30.550 --> 01:17:31.873
- I hate you, Freda!

01:17:34.520 --> 01:17:36.393
- What did I ever do to you, Mom?

01:17:37.581 --> 01:17:41.227
All I've ever done was try to love you.

01:17:42.832 --> 01:17:45.423
- You good-for-nothing
crippled little gimp.

01:17:46.310 --> 01:17:47.953
You ruined my life.

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.273
Doctors said you'd be dead by five.

01:17:53.450 --> 01:17:54.620
- That's what you tell yourself

01:17:54.620 --> 01:17:56.820
so you can live with
what you've done to me.

01:17:57.002 --> 01:17:59.750
- I should have killed
you when I had the chance.

01:17:59.842 --> 01:18:01.210
When you was in my womb.

01:18:04.269 --> 01:18:05.669
- Well, I may be dying, Mom.

01:18:08.651 --> 01:18:09.851
But you're already dead.

01:19:16.712 --> 01:19:18.295
- Simon, my friend.

01:19:19.112 --> 01:19:21.695
You've got the heart of a lion.

01:19:23.397 --> 01:19:24.953
You saved us all.

01:19:30.421 --> 01:19:32.271
I'm sorry I got you into this, Freda.

01:19:33.272 --> 01:19:34.105
- I'm not.

01:19:55.653 --> 01:19:56.736
- Shit, shit.

01:19:57.853 --> 01:19:58.770
Wait, wait.

01:20:05.549 --> 01:20:07.583
I don't think I'm gonna
need that rope, kid.

01:20:12.195 --> 01:20:14.945
- I'm not gonna let you go, Jack.

01:20:15.510 --> 01:20:16.770
- Listen, if I die--

01:20:16.770 --> 01:20:17.603
- You won't.

01:20:20.700 --> 01:20:22.107
- Yeah, but if I do.

01:20:28.410 --> 01:20:29.590
I want you to promise

01:20:29.590 --> 01:20:31.080
you won't let her break you

01:20:33.437 --> 01:20:35.063
the way she was broken.

01:20:37.575 --> 01:20:39.075
- I promise, Jack.

01:20:45.560 --> 01:20:48.430
- Hey, let's go over to
that side of the road.

01:20:50.605 --> 01:20:52.855
Looks beautiful over there.

01:20:53.437 --> 01:20:54.270
- Yeah.

01:20:56.054 --> 01:20:56.887
Let's go.

01:20:59.125 --> 01:20:59.958
Careful.

01:21:46.750 --> 01:21:47.713
- Is he dead?

01:21:48.180 --> 01:21:49.043
- Don't say that.

01:21:50.970 --> 01:21:52.370
He's still breathing, right?

01:21:53.240 --> 01:21:54.073
- Yeah.

01:22:09.520 --> 01:22:10.963
- We never got those stars.

01:22:12.210 --> 01:22:13.453
- It don't matter now.

01:22:15.227 --> 01:22:16.249
- Freda, I'm sorry.

01:22:16.249 --> 01:22:17.199
- It's okay, Bella.

01:22:18.470 --> 01:22:19.363
You were right.

01:22:20.570 --> 01:22:22.020
It's Jack that needs you now.

01:22:29.400 --> 01:22:30.503
Bella, please.

01:22:31.740 --> 01:22:32.883
Please help him.

01:22:36.170 --> 01:22:37.493
I love him so much.

01:22:41.090 --> 01:22:42.340
- He's in real bad shape.

01:22:50.270 --> 01:22:51.500
- She never deserved

01:22:51.500 --> 01:22:53.847
a perfect little soul like you.

01:23:00.040 --> 01:23:01.410
You made me wanna live.

01:23:07.859 --> 01:23:08.692
Wow.

01:23:11.889 --> 01:23:12.972
You are real.

01:23:15.227 --> 01:23:16.533
Can I come with you?

01:23:20.460 --> 01:23:21.543
- Jack? Jack?

01:23:30.480 --> 01:23:32.813
I'll never forget you, Jack.

01:24:43.779 --> 01:24:44.612
- Go.

01:24:47.699 --> 01:24:48.532
Go.

01:25:02.283 --> 01:25:03.200
It's Dylan.

01:25:18.110 --> 01:25:18.993
You'll be okay?

01:25:20.700 --> 01:25:22.050
- But I'll miss you, Bella.

01:25:28.700 --> 01:25:29.793
- I'm always close.

01:25:30.780 --> 01:25:33.203
I'll see you before you know it.

01:26:19.480 --> 01:26:20.640
- It's never about

01:26:20.640 --> 01:26:21.950
how much time we have.

01:26:26.480 --> 01:26:27.940
It's what we choose to do

01:26:27.950 --> 01:26:30.570
with the eighty six thousand
four hundred seconds

01:26:31.080 --> 01:26:32.203
we're given each day.

01:26:32.360 --> 01:26:33.610
- Jack's brother.

01:26:36.260 --> 01:26:37.110
It's complicated.

01:26:39.608 --> 01:26:40.770
We're gonna need to get him a new trailer

01:26:40.770 --> 01:26:42.620
after we spring him from the nut house.

01:26:42.620 --> 01:26:43.670
- I don't think we have

01:26:44.077 --> 01:26:45.173
enough cash here for a trailer.

01:26:45.890 --> 01:26:47.940
- Well, at least some new dresses.

01:26:49.116 --> 01:26:51.997
- What have you got me into now?

01:26:51.997 --> 01:26:54.299
- Don't worry about it.

01:26:54.299 --> 01:26:55.966
I'll be 12 tomorrow.
