Oh, well,
the criminals who are organized

15:09.109 --> 15:11.912
have kept up on the two of you.

15:11.979 --> 15:13.113
Oh, they know everything
about you--

15:13.180 --> 15:15.315
where you work, live, play.

15:15.382 --> 15:16.917
You know,
you're not that hard to follow.

15:16.984 --> 15:20.220
Especially with all the noise
you make in your paper.

15:20.954 --> 15:24.658
The heads of the families would
promote any thuggish cousin

15:24.725 --> 15:26.760
just for... (smacks lips)
shutting you up.

15:26.827 --> 15:30.097
Oh, you're--
Is that supposed to scare me?

15:30.164 --> 15:31.798
I grew up with those boys.

15:31.865 --> 15:33.033
Bring it on!

15:33.100 --> 15:34.735
(chuckles)

15:34.801 --> 15:37.738
Gay men!

15:37.804 --> 15:41.775
We never run scared!

15:41.842 --> 15:43.010
(chuckles)

15:43.076 --> 15:45.112
That's what makes us
such good spies.

15:45.179 --> 15:47.781
We creep back toward death.

15:47.848 --> 15:48.982
We take bigger risks.

15:49.049 --> 15:51.318
We fuck bigger dicks.

15:51.385 --> 15:54.922
We cheat death and then we think
of a new way to court it,

15:54.988 --> 15:57.858
dancing with any devil
that may pop up.

15:57.925 --> 16:01.261
That's why my bosses
allowed you and Detective Read

16:01.328 --> 16:02.696
to continue with your capers.

16:02.763 --> 16:04.064
You're good for business!

16:04.131 --> 16:07.301
You're bringing some edge
to the rumpus room!

16:07.367 --> 16:10.404
Whatever you're on,
you need to adjust the dosage.

16:12.139 --> 16:14.341
Don't walk away from me!

16:14.408 --> 16:15.542
Hey!

16:16.877 --> 16:19.546
You don't walk away from me!

16:20.514 --> 16:23.584
What I'm telling you
is that I spared you!

16:24.918 --> 16:27.287
I told them...

16:28.021 --> 16:29.756
...that you're valuable!

16:29.823 --> 16:31.458
To them!

16:32.659 --> 16:33.927
But also to me!

16:33.994 --> 16:37.264
What the fuck
are you talking about?

16:38.098 --> 16:40.634
Maybe it is these new opioids,

16:40.701 --> 16:42.736
but...

16:42.803 --> 16:44.605
I float

16:44.671 --> 16:45.939
just being near you.

16:46.006 --> 16:47.241
What else do I need to sacrifice

16:47.307 --> 16:49.109
to prove to you
that I'm a good man?

16:49.176 --> 16:50.811
To prove to you
that I am worthy of you?

16:50.878 --> 16:53.013
Because it's all been leading
to this. Gino Barelli.

16:53.080 --> 16:56.083

17:05.092 --> 17:07.194

-Gino,

17:07.261 --> 17:09.763
if I can't have you,

17:09.830 --> 17:10.797
then no...

17:10.864 --> 17:12.599
No!

17:12.666 --> 17:14.201
Don't say it.

17:15.169 --> 17:17.604

Let me do the asking.

21:23.150 --> 21:24.585
Would you?

22:11.832 --> 22:14.401
Don't expect any sympathy
from me.

22:15.169 --> 22:18.005
It ended ugly for both of us.

22:18.772 --> 22:20.574
I wouldn't call him ugly.
