WEBVTT

00:01.012 --> 00:02.700
What the fuck happened back there?

00:02.719 --> 00:04.727
It was an easy job, a smash and grab.

00:04.778 --> 00:07.316
Jesus, Ri, why did you
have to be so careless?

00:11.962 --> 00:14.355
You fucking killed Sharon!

00:14.411 --> 00:17.617
- I need the green wall up and running.
- Good luck with that.

00:17.742 --> 00:19.686
No more bets!

00:19.760 --> 00:22.121
Stop this fight!

00:22.911 --> 00:24.598
What you going to do? Lecture me, huh?

00:24.615 --> 00:26.665
I'm going to teach you
to protect yourself.

00:26.944 --> 00:28.321
You killed Sharon,

00:28.348 --> 00:31.488
- thinking it was me, didn't you?
- You lagged on me?

00:31.500 --> 00:34.306
You wanted me to make
that fucking confession.

01:43.828 --> 01:46.432
Hey, Mum, watch me do this!

01:54.150 --> 01:55.685
Hey, Danny,

01:55.726 --> 01:58.749
your mates at basketball
said to stop slacking off.

01:58.818 --> 02:01.030
They need you to line up for the finals.

02:01.070 --> 02:04.343
Jesus.

02:05.150 --> 02:07.810
So, this Marie Winter, does
she have a history of violence?

02:07.830 --> 02:09.350
She's clean skin.

02:09.389 --> 02:12.331
According to the department briefing
files she owns half the brothels

02:12.350 --> 02:15.222
and strip clubs in Melbourne but
she's never been convicted of anything.

02:15.255 --> 02:16.631
Until now.

02:24.110 --> 02:25.110
Hurry up.

02:31.012 --> 02:33.732
You know, they said with
Danny in the engine room

02:33.750 --> 02:35.968
they reckon they've got it in the bag.

02:36.350 --> 02:38.052
And I said to them,

02:38.731 --> 02:42.205
"Don't worry, Danny will
be on his feet in no time."

02:42.270 --> 02:43.652
_

02:43.670 --> 02:45.130
I said you'll be there.

02:47.190 --> 02:49.754
I'm sorry to report there's no change.

02:51.470 --> 02:55.061
The results of his latest MRI
confirm there's no blood flow.

02:57.149 --> 02:59.149
Unfortunately, he's brain-dead.

02:59.590 --> 03:01.316
He's never going to
regain consciousness.

03:01.441 --> 03:02.790
Winter.

03:04.030 --> 03:05.395
Yes?

03:05.670 --> 03:07.247
Yes, Mr Jackson.

03:08.150 --> 03:09.945
Yes, Mr Jackson.

03:12.115 --> 03:16.452
- Date of birth?
- 6th May 1972.

03:17.174 --> 03:18.816
Now, I know it's not an easy decision

03:18.826 --> 03:20.521
- to have to make.
- What?

03:20.742 --> 03:22.270
I want a second opinion.

03:22.310 --> 03:23.823
Next of kin.

03:27.649 --> 03:30.010
- You need to consider the fact...
- No, no, I won't do that.

03:30.030 --> 03:31.670
I will not kill my son.

03:31.710 --> 03:33.544
Do you have any family contact?

03:36.505 --> 03:37.910
I'm sorry for your loss.

03:40.713 --> 03:41.790
You know?

03:41.804 --> 03:44.312
There's just nothing more
any of us can do for David.

03:48.830 --> 03:50.041
Oh, God!

03:50.087 --> 03:51.934
We were briefed on why you were here.

03:53.288 --> 03:56.337
His name is Danny!

03:57.842 --> 04:00.008
Fuck you!

04:00.350 --> 04:03.710
I'm not proud of what I did, Mr
Jackson. I deserve to be here.

04:03.835 --> 04:07.433
I'm not killing my boy,
you fucking arsehole!

04:07.765 --> 04:10.334
I will not kill my son!

04:10.367 --> 04:12.665
- Never been in prison before?
- No.

04:12.865 --> 04:14.703
Just keep your head
down, it'll go quickly,

04:14.710 --> 04:16.070
and you can get back to your life.

04:20.680 --> 04:21.872
I'm Governor Bennett.

04:21.886 --> 04:23.780
I know, I've seen you on the news.

04:23.990 --> 04:26.990
I'm assuming you're not
familiar with the prison system?

04:27.030 --> 04:28.390
No, Governor, I'm not.

04:28.430 --> 04:31.338
Well, most women go straight
into the general population

04:31.350 --> 04:33.500
but with high-profile prisoners,

04:33.791 --> 04:35.320
such as yourself,

04:36.272 --> 04:37.856
I'd recommend the protection unit.

04:37.926 --> 04:40.510
I'm not looking for
any special treatment.

04:40.550 --> 04:42.835
I'm more concerned
about keeping you safe.

04:43.768 --> 04:45.380
I don't have any enemies.

04:45.505 --> 04:48.179
There may be working
girls in here who know you.

04:49.556 --> 04:51.510
I've always treated my girls well.

04:51.635 --> 04:53.963
You're in here for a violent assault.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.853
Yeah, but I'm not a
violent person, Governor.

04:55.862 --> 04:57.829
- What happened...
- Intentionally causing serious injury.

04:57.843 --> 04:59.487
That is what happened, Ms Winter.

05:02.075 --> 05:04.653
Are you a mother, Governor?

05:05.390 --> 05:07.381
No, and I fail to see

05:07.617 --> 05:09.645
- what that has to do with anything...
- Because the first

05:09.669 --> 05:12.060
moment that you hold your child, it's...

05:14.580 --> 05:15.663
Well,

05:15.737 --> 05:17.016
it's overwhelming.

05:19.624 --> 05:23.479
And you know from that second on
you'll do anything to protect them.

05:27.390 --> 05:28.390
Anything.

05:30.670 --> 05:34.096
All right, I've organised a
peer worker to show you around.

05:34.150 --> 05:35.430
Send Birdsworth in.

05:38.190 --> 05:40.990
Liz, uh, this is Marie Winter.

05:41.030 --> 05:42.559
- Hey.
- Uh, this is Liz.

05:42.570 --> 05:44.530
She's your peer worker.
She'll help settle you in.

05:44.806 --> 05:45.874
H3, Liz.

05:46.030 --> 05:47.589
Yeah, no worries, Ms Bennett.

05:50.025 --> 05:51.862
I trust there'll be no problems.

05:52.165 --> 05:53.630
You don't have to worry.

06:02.362 --> 06:03.740
Slip. Slip.

06:04.765 --> 06:06.823
Keep... keep your defence up.

06:08.030 --> 06:09.943
Slip. Slip. One.

06:12.190 --> 06:13.369
This way.

06:13.630 --> 06:15.017
Keep walking.

06:16.830 --> 06:18.462
I'll have a piece of that!

06:22.350 --> 06:24.497
Best of the bunch here.

06:25.158 --> 06:28.971
- Come back! Come back! I'm going to show you...
- Shut up, you lot!

06:29.444 --> 06:31.092
Oi. Slip.

06:33.919 --> 06:35.556
What's wrong with her?

06:38.420 --> 06:40.482
Shit! Who's on my team?

06:41.199 --> 06:44.832
I want to eat...

06:45.080 --> 06:47.120
What? You... I want to eat your cat?

06:48.950 --> 06:52.230
It must be difficult learning
a new language at her age.

06:52.270 --> 06:54.041
How old do you reckon she is?

06:54.064 --> 06:58.865
Oh, I'd say 350, 400...

06:58.990 --> 07:02.596
- ... in dog years.
- Oh, pussy. Oh, fuck! In your dreams.

07:02.624 --> 07:04.158
New spunks!

07:04.555 --> 07:07.552
- Nice spread here, girls!
- I like your tats!

07:07.590 --> 07:10.381
Hey, is that Marie Winter?

07:11.449 --> 07:13.430
How you doing, Marie?

07:13.470 --> 07:15.687
Marie! Woo!

07:15.692 --> 07:17.257
Shit.

07:17.836 --> 07:19.795
Best looking bunch yet.

07:20.220 --> 07:22.630
You're never going to
fucking believe who's here.

07:25.514 --> 07:27.070
Oh, shit.

07:27.110 --> 07:28.456
Thank you.

07:31.620 --> 07:34.110
- So, are you famous, are you?
- Hardly.

07:34.150 --> 07:35.630
Well, what was all that then?

07:35.670 --> 07:37.614
Some of the women may
have seen me around.

07:37.660 --> 07:39.083
Oh, yeah?

07:42.990 --> 07:45.648
So, this is home, huh?

07:47.630 --> 07:50.161
Yeah, welcome to H1.

07:50.910 --> 07:52.710
Didn't the Governor say H3?

07:52.750 --> 07:54.165
Did she?

07:54.710 --> 07:58.803
Oh, shit, yeah, she did. I'm
sorry, love. It's back this way.

07:59.007 --> 08:00.379
Yeah.

08:00.790 --> 08:02.591
- You all right carrying that?
- Yeah, fine.

08:04.870 --> 08:07.310
- How did you go with Winter?
- I've put her in general.

08:07.311 --> 08:09.972
Will, I've decided to
dismantle the workshop.

08:09.995 --> 08:11.905
I want it pulled apart immediately.

08:11.928 --> 08:13.868
Knock any notion of
reopening it on the head.

08:13.909 --> 08:15.184
After all the shit it's caused,

08:15.194 --> 08:16.477
I mean, no-one's going
to approve that, surely.

08:16.487 --> 08:18.556
Stevens has friends in very high places.

08:18.790 --> 08:21.069
OK, I'll get Jake onto it.

08:21.097 --> 08:23.231
No, I want you to handle it personally.

08:26.840 --> 08:29.150
It's just this week's a
bit of a shocker for me.

08:29.325 --> 08:31.503
- I mean, Jake'll be in soon.
- I'm sorry, Will,

08:31.591 --> 08:33.708
I really need someone
I can trust on this.

08:47.384 --> 08:49.314
- Pushing in.
- There you go.

08:49.337 --> 08:51.166
Hey, what do you reckon
Franky's doing right now?

08:51.190 --> 08:53.028
I would be sleeping in.

08:53.153 --> 08:55.119
Not eating this shit, that's for sure.

08:55.190 --> 08:56.748
I bet I know what she's eating.

08:58.630 --> 08:59.664
Hey.

09:00.130 --> 09:02.214
- Hey.
- Hey, y... you feeling better?

09:02.230 --> 09:04.162
- Yeah, fighting fit.
- Oh, yeah, good,

09:04.173 --> 09:06.434
because you're really
good, eh? Like freaking...

09:06.449 --> 09:08.293
- Like, awesome.
- No, no, I'm deadly, sis.

09:08.315 --> 09:09.908
Yeah, yeah, deadly.

09:10.033 --> 09:11.933
OK, ladies, I need three volunteers.

09:15.931 --> 09:18.640
Fine. Hutch, Radic,
Benson, you'll volunteer,

09:18.648 --> 09:19.817
we're going to the workshop now.

09:19.841 --> 09:21.190
- I haven't finished my...
- Move!

09:21.208 --> 09:23.442
- What's happening with my workshop?
- Come on.

09:25.401 --> 09:27.396
What's up his arse today?

09:38.987 --> 09:40.860
It took balls, Mr J.

09:42.646 --> 09:44.350
- What did you say?
- Balls.

09:44.600 --> 09:46.466
Ferguson and Franky getting in there,

09:46.522 --> 09:48.188
not knowing where they'd end up.

09:49.338 --> 09:51.208
What do you think you're doing?!

09:51.818 --> 09:54.413
This workshop is an
extremely important part

09:54.416 --> 09:56.002
of the prisoner training programme!

09:56.042 --> 09:58.378
Not any more. We're
dismantling it for good.

09:58.422 --> 10:00.079
May I ask why?

10:00.297 --> 10:02.977
Two escapes and Gilmour's murder
might have something to do with it.

10:03.146 --> 10:05.400
- Can you take her back please?
- Stevens.

10:09.713 --> 10:12.082
I'm sorry, Governor. Stevens
insisted on seeing you.

10:12.116 --> 10:13.905
Don't leave, Miss Miles.
This won't take long.

10:13.908 --> 10:16.680
What is Mr Jackson doing in my workshop?

10:16.698 --> 10:18.869
I told you I decided to shut
it down. Now I'm acting on it.

10:18.893 --> 10:20.519
But he's dismantling it completely!

10:20.534 --> 10:22.899
Because it represents an
unacceptably high security risk.

10:22.954 --> 10:25.286
- So if there's nothing else, I've got work to do.
- No, wait, wait!

10:25.310 --> 10:27.211
What if I were able to help you

10:27.336 --> 10:29.473
with your PR problem?

10:29.510 --> 10:31.830
- I don't have a PR problem.
- Sharon Gilmour.

10:34.901 --> 10:36.505
Could you give us a minute, Miss Miles?

10:40.510 --> 10:41.645
Go on.

10:42.380 --> 10:45.029
I may be nothing more than a prisoner,

10:45.074 --> 10:47.950
but I do understand publicity.

10:47.990 --> 10:50.758
Women like you and me, we
need to be very aware...

10:50.806 --> 10:52.106
Get to the point!

10:52.147 --> 10:54.864
Another unsolved murder on your
record can't be very useful.

10:54.878 --> 10:56.235
There's only one.

10:56.470 --> 10:59.297
Just imagine I were to discover
who killed Gilmour. That would...

10:59.308 --> 11:00.910
That would be useful, wouldn't it?

11:02.479 --> 11:04.773
- If you know anything about that...
- No, of course I don't.

11:04.788 --> 11:06.337
But you know how the
prison grapevine works.

11:06.360 --> 11:09.679
- Just say I did hear something.
- Then I would expect you to tell me.

11:10.595 --> 11:12.896
Well, if I were to tell you, that
would be a very big risk for me,

11:12.910 --> 11:15.572
so I would need something in return.

11:15.790 --> 11:17.120
Not a chance.

11:18.710 --> 11:20.018
I'll make you a deal.

11:20.870 --> 11:22.675
The killer for the workshop.

11:22.686 --> 11:24.368
I don't do deals with
prisoners, Stevens.

11:24.397 --> 11:25.428
Miss Miles!

11:27.343 --> 11:28.743
Let's go, Stevens.

11:31.030 --> 11:32.103
I hope you like it!

11:32.169 --> 11:34.882
- Alcohol free!
- Alcohol free, of course!

11:40.946 --> 11:43.433
- Here you go.
- Who does she think she is?

11:46.290 --> 11:48.725
Just let us know if you need anything.

11:54.025 --> 11:56.179
Lovely chocolates. That's kind!

12:08.535 --> 12:09.655
You hungry?

12:09.855 --> 12:11.141
You take that.

12:15.328 --> 12:16.846
Thank you. I love these.

12:18.099 --> 12:21.307
- How's your cell?
- It's really good. It's comfortable...

12:21.621 --> 12:25.184
Oh, rose and almond syrup
cake! Oh, that looks lovely!

12:25.670 --> 12:30.110
Orange blossom and
raspberry angel food cake!

12:30.157 --> 12:32.189
That looks amazing!

12:32.939 --> 12:34.368
- Liz.
- Hey!

12:34.412 --> 12:37.022
Look, I just want to say thanks
for showing me around today.

12:37.114 --> 12:40.001
Oh, geez! But that's not necessary.

12:40.023 --> 12:41.919
- Oh, that's OK.
- Look, they were a gift but

12:41.963 --> 12:43.541
I don't need chocolates, so...

12:43.559 --> 12:45.123
Oh, well, shame to waste it.

12:45.152 --> 12:47.315
- Erm, they're for Liz.
- Oh, it's OK.

12:47.337 --> 12:48.767
It's fine. She owes me.

12:48.838 --> 12:50.710
Hey, erm, how come everyone knows you?

12:50.835 --> 12:53.161
Well, I mean, hardly everyone.

12:54.117 --> 12:56.442
Well, a few women may know
me through my businesses.

12:56.461 --> 12:58.774
- Oh, yeah? What do you sell?
- Sex.

13:00.430 --> 13:02.221
I wasn't expecting that!

13:03.590 --> 13:05.732
Ah! Oh, fuck!

13:05.780 --> 13:08.833
Oh, shit!

13:08.870 --> 13:10.493
- What's the matter?
- Oh, shit!

13:10.836 --> 13:12.790
It hurts, it hurts!

13:12.830 --> 13:14.380
It hurts! It's hurting in the mouth!

13:14.424 --> 13:19.321
It's OK. Calm down. Good, good,
good, good! That's it. Spit it out.

13:19.950 --> 13:21.705
It's in my lip!

13:22.282 --> 13:26.942
- Oh, shit! It's razor blades!
- It's what?

13:27.270 --> 13:28.934
Oh, Booms!

13:34.484 --> 13:37.710
- Here, put this on your mouth.
- What? Get away from me!

13:37.870 --> 13:40.193
You can't think I had
anything to do with that!

13:40.205 --> 13:42.052
Well, where'd the chocolates come from?

13:42.230 --> 13:45.075
- Welcoming committee.
- Oh, God. Some welcome!

13:45.104 --> 13:47.644
Hey! Sh, sh! Try not to talk.

13:47.655 --> 13:49.726
The mouth heals quickly, you
just got to give it a chance.

13:49.750 --> 13:52.636
- Bit of a nurse as well, are you?
- Well, patched up a few.

13:54.447 --> 13:56.070
I just can't believe this happened.

13:56.110 --> 13:58.060
I mean, clearly this was meant for me.

13:58.105 --> 13:59.515
Well, have you got any idea

13:59.526 --> 14:01.733
- who'd want to do that to you?
- No. None.

14:01.790 --> 14:04.619
Well, you might want to be
a bit careful around here.

14:05.606 --> 14:08.954
Oh, Booms. Look at you,
your poor old fiend.

14:08.990 --> 14:11.217
Just keep that ice there, lovely...

14:12.067 --> 14:14.336
- I'll be back in a sec.
- All right.

14:16.619 --> 14:17.690
Allie?

14:20.932 --> 14:22.010
Allie.

14:23.171 --> 14:24.542
My God! It is you!

14:25.851 --> 14:27.987
I can't believe it. How are you?

14:28.350 --> 14:29.406
I'm good.

14:29.624 --> 14:30.825
I'm really good.

14:32.830 --> 14:34.498
God, you look so grown up.

14:36.575 --> 14:37.983
It's been a long time.

14:40.555 --> 14:42.462
I really missed you, Allie.

14:44.901 --> 14:46.992
I know it was messy in the end but

14:47.218 --> 14:49.545
- I never meant to...
- Everything OK?

14:56.283 --> 14:57.430
What do you want?

14:57.649 --> 14:59.235
Hello, Karen!

14:59.313 --> 15:00.854
God, long time!

15:01.046 --> 15:02.421
We're just catching up.

15:02.470 --> 15:03.803
Yeah?

15:04.270 --> 15:06.070
Well, maybe she doesn't
want to catch up.

15:06.110 --> 15:08.105
- I'm fine!
- See? She's fine.

15:08.149 --> 15:09.416
Like she always was.

15:09.442 --> 15:12.018
Cops finally caught up
with you! What was it?

15:12.790 --> 15:14.061
Trafficking?

15:14.710 --> 15:17.327
- Underage workers?
- Wow!

15:18.030 --> 15:19.963
I really moved on, Karen.

15:20.088 --> 15:21.767
I find your recruiting girls in here,

15:21.782 --> 15:25.230
and I will come down on
you like a tonne of shit.

15:25.270 --> 15:26.900
I'm sure that's true.

15:29.843 --> 15:31.424
Good to see you, Allie.

15:38.176 --> 15:39.333
You all right?

15:41.470 --> 15:44.467
I will not let her get her
hooks into you again, OK?

16:09.350 --> 16:10.653
Bah!

16:13.473 --> 16:15.750
Oh, you saved me, Mr J!

16:15.790 --> 16:18.600
I farted! I thought I was
going to choke to death!

16:18.644 --> 16:20.071
Get out, Radic. Now!

16:20.093 --> 16:22.073
- I can't! I'm stuck!
- Now!

16:22.096 --> 16:24.373
OK, keep your shirt on!

16:27.894 --> 16:29.150
That's fuckin' funny!

16:29.190 --> 16:30.914
Get back to work!

16:51.950 --> 16:53.350
Hey, how you doing?

17:06.190 --> 17:08.723
Hey. I'm Marie.

17:09.045 --> 17:10.191
Good for you.

17:11.788 --> 17:13.381
I saw you training before.

17:14.012 --> 17:16.566
Look like you can handle
yourself in a fight.

17:16.869 --> 17:18.828
Take a swing and you'll find out.

17:21.858 --> 17:24.578
I need someone to watch my back.

17:24.633 --> 17:25.967
Get a mirror.

17:30.470 --> 17:32.908
Hey, hey. Pay is good.

17:33.110 --> 17:34.400
There'll be cash.

17:34.525 --> 17:36.473
It'll be waiting for
you when you're released.

17:37.386 --> 17:39.870
You don't look like someone
who needs a bodyguard.

17:41.990 --> 17:43.661
Be easy cash then.

18:14.310 --> 18:15.759
Hey, Ruby.

18:16.350 --> 18:18.276
What's going on with you and Marie?

18:18.646 --> 18:22.023
- Ooh, you jealous!
- No, I'm serious.

18:22.430 --> 18:24.466
Nothing, I'm just her bodyguard.

18:24.910 --> 18:26.385
You should stay away from her.

18:26.422 --> 18:27.826
Allie, I need the cash.

18:27.860 --> 18:30.990
Yeah, except all of her money
comes from fucking over other women.

18:31.030 --> 18:33.225
- She's poison.
- Chill!

18:33.510 --> 18:35.735
I'm just pretty muscles for hire.

18:40.790 --> 18:42.320
- Mr Jackson.
- Hey.

18:49.113 --> 18:52.051
- Sup?
- How long's Marie Winter in for?

18:52.447 --> 18:54.631
12 months, eight for
good behaviour. Why?

18:55.351 --> 18:56.733
She's going to be trouble.

18:56.922 --> 18:58.937
- Why is that?
- Trust me, I know.

18:59.030 --> 19:02.270
Well, when I inducted her, she
was sorry for what she'd done.

19:02.329 --> 19:04.521
- So she sucked you in?
- No!

19:05.230 --> 19:06.668
Of course not!

19:07.085 --> 19:09.938
- She seemed genuine.
- Don't believe a single word she says.

19:09.960 --> 19:11.631
You don't know her like I do.

19:44.110 --> 19:45.569
What are you doing here?

19:45.830 --> 19:47.575
We're in the same unit!

19:48.110 --> 19:49.564
You better get used to that.

19:50.063 --> 19:52.140
Yeah, well, my luck holds.

19:52.910 --> 19:54.745
You going to shiv me in the night?

19:54.970 --> 19:56.933
What did I tell you about
grooming girls in here?

19:56.948 --> 19:59.449
- Well, you heard about the razor blades.
- What about it?

20:02.461 --> 20:05.773
- I mean, I need Ruby for protection in here.
- That had better be all.

20:05.854 --> 20:08.386
Or you will need protection, from me.

20:08.710 --> 20:11.465
If you're top dog, you can find
out who spiked my chocolates.

20:14.790 --> 20:17.790
- They'd be queuing up.
- Hey, maybe it was you.

20:18.226 --> 20:19.604
Maybe it was.

20:19.637 --> 20:22.032
- You've always harboured a grudge.
- I wonder why.

20:22.494 --> 20:23.754
But just so you know,

20:23.765 --> 20:27.431
I don't bear you any ill will
at all about what happened.

20:27.716 --> 20:29.061
Just so you know,

20:29.335 --> 20:30.525
I do.

20:34.715 --> 20:37.424
- Everything all right?
- Fuckin' peachy!

20:45.033 --> 20:46.455
- Yes!
- Yeah!

20:46.655 --> 20:50.513
Oh, she scores!

20:54.310 --> 20:56.067
Woohoo!

20:56.192 --> 20:59.087
Yeah! Hey, Mum, did you just see that?

20:59.105 --> 21:01.145
Allie couldn't get the ball off me.

21:01.448 --> 21:03.358
OK, let's try that again.

21:03.658 --> 21:05.758
Yes!

21:06.715 --> 21:09.055
- Woohoo!
- Woo!

21:15.334 --> 21:19.447
Yeah! Mighty Mouth for the win!

21:28.383 --> 21:29.598
Hey, erm...

21:30.984 --> 21:34.535
If I was going to score,
who should I speak to?

21:35.585 --> 21:37.706
Over there. Kosta.

21:39.630 --> 21:41.184
Not bad!

21:41.620 --> 21:44.464
Here you go: uncut white.

21:45.506 --> 21:46.740
Cash up front.

21:46.780 --> 21:49.540
If I'm paying top dollar, I
want to know what I'm buying.

22:05.954 --> 22:08.478
What's that muck on the
top? Is that baby powder?

22:09.220 --> 22:11.361
Oh, fucking Greeks!

22:11.486 --> 22:13.335
I'm not buying that shit.

22:13.460 --> 22:15.954
Where do you think you are,
the fuckin' Golden Triangle?

22:16.150 --> 22:18.578
- _
- Yes, sir. I've seen it.

22:18.703 --> 22:21.357
I'll be doing that. OK. Goodbye.

22:27.021 --> 22:29.284
- You wanted to see me, Governor?
- Have a look at this.

22:31.081 --> 22:33.850
- Oh, shit!
- The coroner calls our security

22:33.851 --> 22:35.394
world's worst practice,

22:35.405 --> 22:36.891
the opposition wants an inquiry

22:36.917 --> 22:39.215
- into deaths in custody.
- So where are the police on the Gilmour murder?

22:39.237 --> 22:41.465
No weapon, no motive, no suspect.

22:43.060 --> 22:44.478
Basically no idea.

22:51.940 --> 22:54.094
Oh! Governor!

22:54.380 --> 22:56.182
This is a pleasant surprise.

22:59.140 --> 23:01.714
What have you heard about
Gilmour on your grapevine?

23:01.876 --> 23:04.271
Ah! So we have a deal.

23:04.293 --> 23:07.681
- I told you I don't do deals with prisoners.
- No, no, no, of course. But,

23:07.884 --> 23:10.219
you will reopen my workshop.

23:10.780 --> 23:12.511
MY workshop.

23:16.300 --> 23:18.427
With certain provisos.

23:19.500 --> 23:20.501
Yes.

23:20.834 --> 23:21.898
Mm-hm!

23:21.980 --> 23:23.860
24-hour surveillance,

23:23.900 --> 23:25.807
and every woman in that workshop

23:25.859 --> 23:27.319
has to have a TAFE certificate.

23:27.500 --> 23:28.500
Done.

24:01.031 --> 24:02.100
Hey.

24:03.580 --> 24:06.282
- You wanted me for something?
- Shut the door, will you?

24:07.220 --> 24:09.398
Ooh! Big secret, eh?

24:11.585 --> 24:13.248
Now, Kosta's gear's shit.

24:13.699 --> 24:14.903
I can't use it.

24:15.900 --> 24:18.063
I wouldn't have taken you for a junkie.

24:18.580 --> 24:19.620
I'm not.

24:21.660 --> 24:23.020
It's OK, I was...

24:23.060 --> 24:25.870
This joint will do your
head in, that's for sure.

24:25.895 --> 24:27.977
Will you help me bring in my own gear?

24:28.980 --> 24:31.177
Nah. That's not my thing.

24:31.218 --> 24:32.316
I'll pay you.

24:32.826 --> 24:34.470
Marie, I wouldn't know where to start.

24:34.485 --> 24:36.380
No, that's OK. I'll organise everything.

24:36.420 --> 24:38.177
Well, why don't you do it yourself then?

24:38.927 --> 24:41.129
They're bloody watching me like hawks.

24:42.660 --> 24:43.872
But don't worry, I'll...

24:44.140 --> 24:45.698
I'll find someone else.

24:46.020 --> 24:47.941
Just thought you could
really do with the money.

24:53.055 --> 24:54.334
Oh, fuck it!

24:55.100 --> 24:56.304
I'll give it a crack.

24:57.300 --> 24:58.495
All right, ladies, !

24:58.532 --> 25:00.181
step out of your cells, please

25:02.003 --> 25:04.327
Everyone out in the lounge
now. This is a cell toss.

25:04.357 --> 25:05.775
Mitchell, back to your unit.

25:05.900 --> 25:08.809
The rest of you, assume your
position outside your cell.

25:08.810 --> 25:09.790
What? Again?

25:09.791 --> 25:12.335
- Welcome to the new world order, Proctor.
- What's that?

25:12.401 --> 25:14.493
Well, we're going to
keep tossing the H Block

25:14.519 --> 25:16.140
until we shake out all your contra.

25:16.180 --> 25:18.740
Right, listen, ladies.
This is a random cell toss.

25:18.766 --> 25:21.249
- Out here now. Let's go.
- For fuck's sake.

25:23.026 --> 25:25.265
- I've just tidied me undies.
- Good for you.

25:25.291 --> 25:26.551
For fuck's sake!

25:26.590 --> 25:28.670
Baxter! Out!

25:28.795 --> 25:30.550
Sorry, Mr Jackson. I was on the loo.

25:30.605 --> 25:32.906
- Are you going to pack it up?
- Yeah, I thought I was going

25:32.930 --> 25:34.586
to be fucking sleeping tonight.

25:35.989 --> 25:37.630
- Fucking cleaning up after...
- Jesus!

25:38.114 --> 25:39.378
Nothing fucking there.

25:39.814 --> 25:42.390
- Do you mind?
- For fuck's sake.

25:47.320 --> 25:48.329
What's this?

25:49.279 --> 25:51.353
Fucked if I know. I've
never seen it before.

25:51.390 --> 25:52.913
It just walked from the
kitchen to your cell, did it?

25:52.935 --> 25:54.521
I don't fucking no. It's not mine.

25:54.553 --> 25:57.321
- Slot it!
- Fuck off! Fuck! Fuck off!

25:57.347 --> 26:00.994
Fuck off! For fuck's
sake. Bullshit! Fuck you!

26:01.279 --> 26:04.335
Argh! You fucking
cocksucker, mother fucker!

26:04.350 --> 26:06.272
It's not even fucking mine.

26:06.431 --> 26:08.331
I've been fucking set up.

26:08.990 --> 26:11.017
- Fuck!
- Keep it down, Baxter.

26:11.051 --> 26:13.618
I fucking loved Sharon.
Why would I kill her?

26:23.630 --> 26:25.235
You're early this morning, Stevens.

26:25.276 --> 26:26.873
It is a matter of some urgency.

26:26.906 --> 26:29.937
I'll be all right, Miss Miles. Make
it quick, I've got a full morning.

26:32.150 --> 26:33.310
Good.

26:34.784 --> 26:37.933
Now that I've upheld my
end of our little bargain,

26:38.302 --> 26:40.870
I'm just making sure you
intend to reciprocate.

26:42.070 --> 26:43.302
What are you talking about?

26:43.705 --> 26:44.725
As agreed,

26:45.006 --> 26:47.204
I delivered Gilmour's murderer to you.

26:47.858 --> 26:51.501
The weapon was discovered
during a cell toss.

26:51.516 --> 26:53.590
Who do you think tipped
off your officers?

26:54.491 --> 26:55.876
You're going to have to prove it.

26:55.891 --> 26:58.187
Ask Mr Jackson what he was looking for.

26:58.364 --> 27:01.679
I left him a note telling him
that Baxter had knuckle-dusters.

27:01.697 --> 27:03.571
Of course, my information suggested,

27:03.585 --> 27:05.592
he would also find the murder weapon.

27:07.850 --> 27:10.225
- I'll need to confirm that with Mr Jackson.
- Good.

27:10.433 --> 27:11.816
And when you do, I'd like to resume

27:11.827 --> 27:13.109
in the workshop immediately, please.

27:13.131 --> 27:16.908
I will decide if and when that happens.

27:21.173 --> 27:24.199
The prison grapevine
can be very informative.

27:24.516 --> 27:27.466
You don't think we should make
this an ongoing arrangement?

27:30.459 --> 27:32.344
Take Stevens back to her unit.

27:43.401 --> 27:44.710
Morning, Will.

27:46.480 --> 27:49.529
Hey, well done. With Baxter last night.

27:49.796 --> 27:50.797
Oh, thanks.

27:51.185 --> 27:53.905
Hopefully, the women
will feel a bit safer now.

27:53.936 --> 27:55.710
Oh, we got lucky, really.

27:56.853 --> 27:58.135
How do you mean?

27:58.175 --> 27:59.949
Er, we found the weapon by accident.

28:00.637 --> 28:02.307
What was the toss for, then?

28:02.348 --> 28:04.972
Anonymous tip-off about knuckle-dusters.

28:11.432 --> 28:12.969
We're back, bitches.

28:12.988 --> 28:15.460
Green wall's back in
business. So, piss off!

28:15.470 --> 28:17.947
- What going on?
- You heard her. Workshop's back on.

28:18.036 --> 28:19.687
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

28:19.812 --> 28:21.661
All right, lowlifes,
finish what you're doing

28:21.670 --> 28:22.996
and let's get out of here.

28:23.002 --> 28:25.744
- Yes, yes, off you go.
- What's going on?

28:25.770 --> 28:28.199
Ah! This is better.

28:28.324 --> 28:30.216
Does feel good to be
back, doesn't it, ladies?

28:30.341 --> 28:31.976
How the hell did you wangle this?

28:32.039 --> 28:33.427
It's not what you
know, it's who you know.

28:33.451 --> 28:36.223
- Yeah, well, your grand plan seems to be working.
- It is, indeed.

28:36.242 --> 28:37.664
It's right on track.

28:39.356 --> 28:40.816
Elizabeth, seedlings.

28:40.831 --> 28:44.064
Susan, let's make up an inventory
before we start, shall we?

28:44.189 --> 28:46.367
Now, I think we should
count everything first, eh?

28:46.390 --> 28:47.890
- Same thing.
- Dumb fuck.

28:48.015 --> 28:50.015
- Ueugh!
- I was joking!

28:50.041 --> 28:51.674
- Yeah, sure.
- I was.

28:52.136 --> 28:54.136
Don't forget the conditions,

28:54.597 --> 28:57.148
- no-one's to touch machines without a ticket.
- Of course.

28:57.177 --> 28:59.436
I never renege on a deal.

29:01.113 --> 29:03.464
Susan, Susan.

29:03.589 --> 29:06.187
Remember what we said about
everyone being certified.

29:06.261 --> 29:08.410
Mm-hmm. I'm a supervisor.

29:08.450 --> 29:10.377
Same rule. Every person.

29:11.018 --> 29:12.082
But...

29:13.057 --> 29:15.622
I can weld better than any
of the fucking teachers.

29:15.626 --> 29:18.025
Yes, of course you can,
and everything will be fine,

29:18.051 --> 29:20.161
as soon as you do the test.

29:21.939 --> 29:24.836
- What's the test?
- Well, there's a pract, of course.

29:24.850 --> 29:28.125
Then just a short written test
which covers occupational health

29:28.130 --> 29:30.743
- and safety and things like that.
- Nah, I don't need to do the test.

29:30.767 --> 29:33.942
- It's mostly multiple-choice.
- Well, it's even worse then, isn't it?

29:33.964 --> 29:36.562
Because they've got the trick
answers in there to like,

29:36.581 --> 29:39.186
- fuck you up.
- Nobody's trying to trick anyone.

29:39.201 --> 29:40.594
I'm not fucking doing it.

29:41.389 --> 29:42.945
You can't not give it a go.

29:42.948 --> 29:45.528
- You can do it, love.
- I'm not doing a test.

29:45.978 --> 29:47.117
Where are you going?

29:47.139 --> 29:49.327
What, do I need a ticket
now to take a dump?

29:59.268 --> 30:01.600
- It's good to see you, Babe.
- Yeah, you too.

30:01.660 --> 30:03.733
- How are you?
- Yeah, all good.

30:06.656 --> 30:09.243
Listen, um, I've been...

30:10.185 --> 30:11.880
I've been having a bit of a think.

30:11.920 --> 30:14.332
And I should never have let
you go back in for that cash.

30:14.343 --> 30:16.504
- It's fine, Ray, I did it to myself.
- I shouldn't have let you do it.

30:16.512 --> 30:17.699
It wasn't your fault.

30:18.508 --> 30:21.102
- I'm going to tell them that I did it.
- No, don't do that.

30:21.117 --> 30:23.807
- There were witnesses, anyhow.
- Yeah, I'll take care of them.

30:23.841 --> 30:25.892
I'll pay them off, or
I'll fucking knock 'em off.

30:25.911 --> 30:27.377
Don't even joke about it.

30:27.392 --> 30:29.691
Reet, I'm going to tell them
that I forced you to do it,

30:29.702 --> 30:32.721
so it's my arse and they'll
let you off on good behaviour.

30:32.998 --> 30:34.299
I don't want you to do that.

30:34.780 --> 30:36.960
It is fucking killing
me, you being in here.

30:37.200 --> 30:39.360
It's only 12 months.
I'll be out in eight.

30:39.400 --> 30:42.075
And, besides, the club needs
you to sort the Butchers out.

30:45.394 --> 30:46.725
You look after yourself.

30:47.445 --> 30:49.049
And you keep your head down.

30:54.863 --> 30:56.818
I got plans for you and me, babe.

31:03.335 --> 31:04.440
Take a seat.

31:06.724 --> 31:07.920
Next!

31:17.205 --> 31:19.004
Who was that visiting you?

31:20.128 --> 31:21.233
Who was it?

31:22.364 --> 31:24.378
Who the fuck!

31:25.427 --> 31:28.480
- I can't fucking swallow it.
- You idiot!

31:28.605 --> 31:30.715
If that bursts inside you...

31:37.781 --> 31:39.163
Mitchell, you're up.

31:53.370 --> 31:55.594
They catch you, it's another six months.

31:55.979 --> 31:57.161
Who is this for?

31:58.159 --> 31:59.330
Marie Winter.

32:01.250 --> 32:02.336
Give it to her.

32:02.920 --> 32:04.590
And tell her you're not doing it again.

32:04.598 --> 32:06.529
I thought you weren't going
to tell me what to do any more.

32:06.553 --> 32:08.911
Well, then, you better
learn how to swallow.

32:14.876 --> 32:17.607
- I thought you were keeping an eye on Ruby.
- I am.

32:17.610 --> 32:19.690
Then, how come she's Marie's drug mule?

32:25.545 --> 32:28.368
What the fuck are you doing
making Ruby bring your shit in?

32:29.358 --> 32:31.250
I didn't make her. She wanted to.

32:31.290 --> 32:33.512
Yeah, of course she wanted
to, she needs the money.

32:33.741 --> 32:34.961
But I know you.

32:34.975 --> 32:38.191
You find desperate young
girls and you suck them in

32:38.213 --> 32:40.837
and you get them hooked on
drugs and then you use them.

32:40.867 --> 32:42.497
That's Kaz Proctor's version.

32:42.542 --> 32:44.116
Kaz rescued me.

32:44.130 --> 32:47.412
I don't know why you left me, but
it wasn't because I mistreated you.

32:47.419 --> 32:48.535
That was the opposite.

32:48.716 --> 32:50.176
Now, what we had

32:50.730 --> 32:53.025
was very special. You
have to remember that.

32:53.050 --> 32:54.962
Yeah, I remember you gave me smack

32:55.021 --> 32:58.170
- and you got me addicted to it.
- I never intended you to abuse it.

32:58.210 --> 33:00.307
It was your responsibility
to control that.

33:00.319 --> 33:02.141
- How?
- Like I do.

33:02.526 --> 33:04.030
Like I've always done.

33:06.225 --> 33:07.703
I was a baby.

33:08.191 --> 33:09.695
Living on the street.

33:09.820 --> 33:11.203
You were the adult.

33:11.720 --> 33:13.179
Oh, come on!

33:13.304 --> 33:16.117
I was your lover, all
right? Not your mother.

33:19.476 --> 33:22.074
Who does that to someone they love?

33:25.260 --> 33:26.605
But I did love you.

33:28.512 --> 33:29.650
Sweetheart.

33:32.008 --> 33:33.450
I loved you very much.

33:41.757 --> 33:43.287
- Let's go, ladies.
- Way-hey!

33:43.298 --> 33:45.608
Come on move along. Move along. Come on.

33:46.077 --> 33:48.631
- I'll do a final sweep.
- Yep, righto.

33:59.718 --> 34:00.726
Radick?*

34:09.946 --> 34:11.438
Get me out of here!

34:12.710 --> 34:14.078
Get me out of here!

34:14.123 --> 34:16.647
Fire alarm! Help! Help!

34:39.647 --> 34:41.810
Fire! Fire!

34:45.449 --> 34:47.534
Will!

34:48.290 --> 34:50.002
Will!

34:50.770 --> 34:52.799
What the fuck are you doing?

34:53.330 --> 34:54.583
Jesus, Will!

34:55.447 --> 34:57.599
Do you want to explain
what this is about?

34:57.629 --> 35:00.445
I don't know, OK. I was just...

35:00.851 --> 35:03.490
I was just having trouble
sleeping, OK? Just bad dreams.

35:04.040 --> 35:05.954
So, get some sleeping
tablets, or something.

35:05.973 --> 35:07.880
- It's not as simple as that, Jake.
- Listen,

35:08.305 --> 35:09.971
you need to get your shit together.

35:10.045 --> 35:11.350
Or you're going to blow it.

35:11.368 --> 35:14.174
- That's easy for you to say, OK?
- How is it easy for me?

35:14.370 --> 35:16.155
Vera hates my guts.

35:16.280 --> 35:19.352
I'm in this shit with you and
you're acting like a fucking lunatic.

35:19.363 --> 35:22.862
You didn't have to bury
someone fucking alive! OK?

35:24.770 --> 35:25.810
What?

35:30.664 --> 35:32.383
You buried her alive?

35:32.704 --> 35:34.124
What did you expect, Jake?

35:34.930 --> 35:35.961
Eh?

35:36.375 --> 35:37.895
I was just going to fucking shoot her?

37:06.610 --> 37:08.249
Mate, no wonder you can't sleep.

37:10.829 --> 37:12.496
- Where did you bury her?
- Just...

37:14.050 --> 37:15.094
Just leave it.

37:15.848 --> 37:16.924
OK.

37:23.970 --> 37:26.530
Attention, compound,
attention, compound.

37:26.570 --> 37:29.096
All women are to report to...

37:30.541 --> 37:32.071
Hey-ho, Booms.

37:33.800 --> 37:35.325
Off to work we go, eh?

37:35.450 --> 37:39.445
Oh, I... I'm... I'm...
I'm chucking a sickie.

37:39.653 --> 37:40.696
What?

37:41.183 --> 37:42.887
- You can't.
- I can.

37:43.012 --> 37:44.834
Aren't you the boss, bitch?

37:45.034 --> 37:46.933
No. Not any more.

37:46.974 --> 37:48.959
Yeah, course you are.

37:48.989 --> 37:50.511
You're the big bad-a-boom!

37:50.530 --> 37:54.174
I'm not the big bad... anything.

37:55.641 --> 37:58.816
Um, you're properly going
to find out soon, anyway.

37:58.989 --> 38:00.818
I'm a dumb ass.

38:00.903 --> 38:05.687
Yeah, I'm too dense to pass
that test, so I'm not doing it.

38:06.290 --> 38:07.472
Can't do it.

38:07.894 --> 38:09.135
Yeah.

38:09.989 --> 38:11.874
What you mean, yeah? Yeah, yeah?

38:11.925 --> 38:14.172
- You think I'm dumb, too?
- No, no, no.

38:14.210 --> 38:16.791
I'm a fuck up when it
comes to tests, too.

38:18.939 --> 38:21.540
- You can still have a crack at it, though.
- No.

38:22.298 --> 38:25.930
No fucking way. So them bitches
can just fucking laugh at me? No.

38:25.975 --> 38:27.610
- Screw what they think.
- No.

38:27.848 --> 38:30.150
Boomer, do it for yourself.

38:32.125 --> 38:33.451
Come on.

38:34.010 --> 38:35.377
I'll help you.

38:37.850 --> 38:39.881
- Really?
- Yeah.

38:40.490 --> 38:42.532
Well, if you want me to.

38:42.720 --> 38:45.492
You wouldn't know fuck all
about welding, though, would you?

38:45.690 --> 38:48.053
So what? I can still drill you.

38:48.068 --> 38:49.653
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

38:50.606 --> 38:52.990
- Oh.
- Come on.

38:53.580 --> 38:56.050
You go get the practice test
and we'll start tomorrow.

38:56.533 --> 38:57.878
Ah, um...

38:57.908 --> 38:59.405
Yeah, yeah, yeah?

38:59.424 --> 39:00.690
We'll show these bitches.

39:00.701 --> 39:01.787
- OK!
- Yeah?

39:01.813 --> 39:05.089
- Yeah? Come on, Boomer! Get up, then!
- Don't do that to me!

39:06.770 --> 39:08.882
- Catch you later.
- OK.

39:19.566 --> 39:21.511
You didn't eat my chocolates.

39:22.911 --> 39:24.410
Remember me?

39:25.050 --> 39:28.053
I used to work for you till
a pissed client glassed me.

39:28.473 --> 39:30.021
That was you?

39:31.680 --> 39:33.356
Hey, look, I'm really, really sorry

39:33.389 --> 39:36.285
but I told them to get
you the very best doctors,

39:36.308 --> 39:38.605
- I paid for everything.
- And then you threw me out.

39:38.623 --> 39:40.152
I wouldn't have done that, no.

39:40.175 --> 39:43.848
"Who's going to pay to
fuck a Scarface?" you said.

39:44.051 --> 39:46.431
No, I would never have said that.

39:46.556 --> 39:49.189
- All my workers get...
- Shut the fuck up.

39:50.269 --> 39:52.930
I'm not your worker!

39:54.598 --> 39:57.670
- Drop it! Drop it!
- You're going to break my arm!

39:57.851 --> 40:00.891
Come here again, and I fucking will.

40:06.199 --> 40:08.320
- You OK?
- Yeah, I'm just a bit shaken.

40:08.361 --> 40:09.617
Get that a lot?

40:09.650 --> 40:12.422
I treat my girls better than
any of the men in the business,

40:12.436 --> 40:14.907
- I can tell you that.
- What business is that?

40:15.370 --> 40:17.161
Gentlemen's entertainment.

40:17.286 --> 40:19.701
Let me guess, you've got
an opinion on that, too.

40:19.715 --> 40:21.803
- Not especially, no.
- Hey.

40:23.650 --> 40:26.118
You can handle yourself.
You've got a cool head.

40:26.730 --> 40:28.530
You want to be my guardian angel?

40:34.766 --> 40:35.890
Hey.

40:37.404 --> 40:38.947
What happened to your hands?

40:39.316 --> 40:41.658
- Jammed in a door.
- Really?

40:45.155 --> 40:46.605
That's some door.

40:55.850 --> 40:57.090
Rita!

40:58.450 --> 40:59.766
Thanks for nothing.

41:00.298 --> 41:02.613
Marie just sacked me and
you're her new bodyguard.

41:02.650 --> 41:05.685
- Yeah, sorry about that.
- I need that money.

41:05.879 --> 41:08.004
- I'm doing you a favour.
- Well, do me another favour.

41:08.028 --> 41:09.972
Stay the fuck out of my life.

41:35.210 --> 41:37.818
Ruby told me that you cut her loose.

41:39.902 --> 41:41.334
Thank you.

41:42.447 --> 41:43.842
It's no problem.

41:46.286 --> 41:47.907
See, I'm not the evil woman.

41:47.926 --> 41:49.885
I never said that you were evil.

41:50.370 --> 41:51.630
Just...

41:52.125 --> 41:53.737
You're not good for me.

41:55.179 --> 41:58.260
Well, I remember it differently.
You were living on the streets.

41:59.179 --> 42:00.967
I brought you into my home.

42:00.981 --> 42:02.829
I took care of you.

42:03.249 --> 42:07.087
You were family. You understand
that? I'll let you into my life.

42:07.130 --> 42:09.129
Yeah, and you ruined mine.

42:09.810 --> 42:12.353
Well, if that's the
case, I've been punished.

42:13.928 --> 42:15.924
You're going to be out
of here soon enough.

42:16.090 --> 42:17.550
I lost Danny.

42:20.730 --> 42:21.930
What?

42:24.147 --> 42:26.332
Some animal came and hit him.

42:28.174 --> 42:31.477
- He ended up in a coma.
- Oh, my God.

42:32.193 --> 42:34.854
I wasn't there to hold his hand.

42:36.715 --> 42:38.683
He died alone.
