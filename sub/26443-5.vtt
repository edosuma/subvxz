WEBVTT

00:15.480 --> 00:17.520
She was somewhat aloof, but a good girl.

00:20.400 --> 00:23.160
She was one of those rich girls
who paint their nails black

00:23.240 --> 00:24.600
to look like rebels.

00:24.680 --> 00:25.520
Smarter.

00:25.760 --> 00:27.480
She thought she was different...

00:28.400 --> 00:29.920
because she acted all mysterious.

00:34.280 --> 00:36.640
I thought I knew her,
but now I'm not sure.

00:37.080 --> 00:39.600
-Where's your brother?
-In his room. Why?

00:40.320 --> 00:41.320
No reason.

00:41.400 --> 00:45.000
Because there's always people around,
and now we're all alone...

00:48.680 --> 00:50.640
-Is it yours?
-No, my brother's.

00:55.640 --> 00:57.840
-What's all this?
-Samu, what's going on?

00:57.920 --> 01:00.040
No way.
Someone's sending him license plates.

01:00.120 --> 01:01.800
-What?
-Nano!

01:01.880 --> 01:03.280
-Samuel?
-Nano!

01:03.360 --> 01:04.680
-What?
-What's this?

01:04.760 --> 01:06.960
-Who's sending you plates?
-Why do you have my phone?

01:07.040 --> 01:08.520
How can you be stupid enough

01:08.600 --> 01:11.240
to think about stealing cars again
while you're on parole?

01:11.320 --> 01:12.800
You could go to jail again.

01:12.880 --> 01:14.440
Leave me alone. Hi, Marina.

01:14.520 --> 01:17.040
The people you owe money to are
in jail.

01:17.120 --> 01:19.280
-Maybe I could help.
-No, stay out of this.

01:19.360 --> 01:20.840
-Here's what we'll do.
-What?

01:20.920 --> 01:23.200
From now on,
mind your own fucking business.

01:24.680 --> 01:27.520
-Nano, what are you--
-Mind your own fucking business, Samu!

01:30.200 --> 01:31.280
Look who's here!

01:33.360 --> 01:34.840
What's that? What are you doing?

01:34.920 --> 01:38.080
The clothes you gave me.
My dad's forcing me to return them.

01:38.160 --> 01:39.560
So you paid for those clothes?

01:39.640 --> 01:41.760
Obviously.
How could I have paid for them?

01:41.840 --> 01:44.600
-Stay, and we'll talk about it.
-Sure.

01:47.000 --> 01:50.040
How can you return this?
It's cool and you looked great in it.

01:50.440 --> 01:52.120
-Try it on.
-Now?

01:52.320 --> 01:53.800
Now. Right, Polo?

01:59.280 --> 02:02.880
And your butt looks great in these pants.
Put these on, too.

02:03.080 --> 02:05.600
Maybe you both really do see me
as a sex object.

02:05.680 --> 02:08.000
What are you saying?
Tell him he's wrong, Polo.

02:09.920 --> 02:11.040
Take his pants off.

02:11.880 --> 02:12.720
Come on.

02:13.840 --> 02:16.560
Careful. I got stuff down there.
Don't mess around.

02:17.320 --> 02:19.680
What would you call
this thing we've got going on?

02:19.760 --> 02:21.720
Why do we need to define it?

02:22.200 --> 02:24.080
Labels are for clothes.

02:26.320 --> 02:28.800
-Oh well!
-We can't return this.

02:28.960 --> 02:30.080
That sucks!

02:31.720 --> 02:34.040
-Can't return this, either.
-Oh, oops!

03:01.680 --> 03:02.760
No way.

03:17.520 --> 03:18.400
Good morning.

03:18.800 --> 03:19.920
Good morning.

03:20.120 --> 03:21.680
-I'm so tired!
-Why?

03:22.880 --> 03:24.840
Because I'm not sleeping well lately.

03:24.920 --> 03:28.440
I'm taking a medication.
I hope the side effects won't last long.

03:28.520 --> 03:30.880
-The veil!
-Don't worry, I won't say anything.

03:31.840 --> 03:34.480
I've already gotten used
to all this cultural diversity.

03:35.920 --> 03:39.160
Come on, guys. It was a joke.
Nadia, I'm serious.

03:39.240 --> 03:41.560
I think we should meet up
to share some ideas.

03:41.640 --> 03:44.400
We could surprise each other.

03:45.000 --> 03:47.200
How about today
at Guzmán's birthday party?

03:49.240 --> 03:51.560
Oh, no. She wasn't invited, right?

03:51.640 --> 03:55.400
-Lu.
-Sorry, since you're such close friends...

03:55.480 --> 03:56.840
I thought you'd be going.

03:56.920 --> 03:59.480
Maybe it's just an intimate gathering,
right, Marina?

03:59.560 --> 04:00.520
Have a nice day.

04:02.480 --> 04:05.520
Does she practice that at home,
or does she make it up on the spot?

04:05.960 --> 04:08.240
Nadia, it isn't a big party.
It's a family thing.

04:08.320 --> 04:09.960
Marina, don't worry.

04:12.120 --> 04:13.960
Samuel, one thing.

04:14.880 --> 04:19.840
I know you only want to protect me,
and not involve me in your problems...

04:20.240 --> 04:22.680
but I think I know
how to help your brother.

04:24.280 --> 04:26.720
Seriously, Marina. Forget it.

04:28.040 --> 04:30.000
The more you stay away from him,
the better.

04:30.080 --> 04:31.000
Listen to me.

04:31.080 --> 04:33.120
I'm doing this for you.
I know you love him.

04:33.200 --> 04:36.040
-Do you want him to get hurt?
-No, I don't want you to get hurt.

04:36.120 --> 04:38.480
He's dangerous.
He could get you in a lot of trouble.

04:40.240 --> 04:43.680
Look. Remember those files
you told me your parents hide in a safe?

04:44.880 --> 04:47.520
-Yes.
-Well, my brother asked me to steal them.

04:48.040 --> 04:49.760
-What?
-I didn't do it.

04:49.840 --> 04:52.280
I'd never do anything to hurt you.

04:52.360 --> 04:54.960
I want you to stay away from him,
because I almost did it.

04:55.040 --> 04:56.840
My brother is capable of anything.

04:58.760 --> 05:00.000
Understood?

05:00.760 --> 05:02.600
Samuel, we'll talk later, OK?

05:03.200 --> 05:04.040
Marina!

05:08.520 --> 05:09.920
Happy birthday.

05:10.280 --> 05:12.320
-It's your birthday, isn't it?
-Yes, thanks.

05:12.800 --> 05:16.600
It's actually the day my parents chose.
We don't know exactly when I was born.

05:17.160 --> 05:18.120
Who told you?

05:19.160 --> 05:20.280
It doesn't matter.

05:20.760 --> 05:21.920
It was Lu, right?

05:22.240 --> 05:23.080
Who else?

05:24.120 --> 05:25.760
She invited herself to the party.

05:27.000 --> 05:29.040
Do you want to celebrate,
just the two of us?

05:29.120 --> 05:31.440
I'll kick everyone out of the house.
We'll be alone.

05:32.200 --> 05:33.080
I'm not interested.

05:42.160 --> 05:43.000
Damn!

05:46.320 --> 05:47.520
Fuck!

05:53.640 --> 05:55.200
We'll take a five-minute break!

05:58.080 --> 05:59.480
Your wrist is OK, right?

06:00.840 --> 06:02.240
So, what's going on?

06:02.520 --> 06:03.400
Nothing. Why?

06:03.480 --> 06:05.200
You're playing worse.

06:05.840 --> 06:07.800
On Friday,
you have a match you need to win.

06:07.880 --> 06:12.120
I'm allowed to have a bad day, right?
Besides, it still hurts a little.

06:13.240 --> 06:14.680
No excuses.

06:18.800 --> 06:21.880
I know what you're made of.
We share the same DNA, kid.

06:22.320 --> 06:25.280
Enough, Dad. I like it better
when you're not trying to be nice.

06:26.680 --> 06:28.000
Don't I have five minutes?

06:38.320 --> 06:40.560
A toast to the birthday boy, Guzmán.

06:40.640 --> 06:41.720
Thanks.

06:43.360 --> 06:46.480
Well, I have a little something
for the birthday boy.

06:46.560 --> 06:47.840
I hope you like it.

06:50.880 --> 06:51.880
How about that?

06:52.160 --> 06:55.920
Your birthday is the perfect occasion
to start a watch collection, like mine.

06:56.120 --> 06:57.280
Have I showed it to you?

06:57.360 --> 06:58.880
-No.
-I'll have to.

06:59.320 --> 07:02.720
Look, Guzmán. It's always with me.

07:03.560 --> 07:05.320
If only it could talk, right, Ventura?

07:05.440 --> 07:09.040
But not with ladies present.
Ones who grow prettier by the day.

07:12.400 --> 07:15.160
Well, Guzmán, mine is more modest,

07:15.240 --> 07:16.360
but happy birthday.

07:18.440 --> 07:20.920
No... How did you know I wanted this?

07:23.080 --> 07:24.000
I love it!

07:24.160 --> 07:26.880
-I'll take a picture.
-No, wait. My present first.

07:28.560 --> 07:31.000
Well, well. What a great girlfriend!

07:31.080 --> 07:32.560
We're just friends.

07:35.360 --> 07:36.480
Do you like it?

07:36.880 --> 07:39.960
-You shouldn't have, Lu.
-Who else could have bought it for you?

07:40.640 --> 07:43.520
Other girls would need to save
for an eternity to buy it.

07:45.200 --> 07:47.320
-Let's take the picture.
-Yes, sure.

07:49.200 --> 07:51.400
-Excuse us.
-So much for the family photo.

07:51.480 --> 07:53.960
It's fine.
Can you take a photo of me and my sister?

07:54.040 --> 07:55.720
Sure. Stand over there.

07:55.840 --> 07:58.760
This is vintage... or just old, right?

08:00.440 --> 08:03.560
Don't worry about it. It's safe.
No one knows about it.

08:03.640 --> 08:05.160
Everything is at stake.

08:05.640 --> 08:08.160
-Have I ever failed you in these 20 years?
-Marina!

08:09.600 --> 08:10.440
Smile!

08:13.160 --> 08:14.160
How cute!

08:17.600 --> 08:19.880
Hi! Samu isn't working.

08:20.720 --> 08:23.520
What the fuck were you doing
at my place when we hooked up?

08:24.520 --> 08:27.880
I know what you did. Your brother told me.
I wanted to hear it from you.

08:28.960 --> 08:30.680
So, what we had was a lie?

08:30.760 --> 08:33.920
-You did it to break into my house.
-What do you mean, what we had?

08:34.360 --> 08:36.840
-What did you think this was?
-Fuck you.

08:37.600 --> 08:41.080
I fucked you to rob your place.
To keep you away from my brother.

08:41.160 --> 08:44.040
To prove to him you're a rich girl
who falls for jerks.

08:44.120 --> 08:47.160
-That's why I fucked you. And know what?
-What?

08:50.760 --> 08:53.080
And now I can't get you out
of my fucking head.

08:53.400 --> 08:55.880
But you're with my brother.
That's how it has to be.

08:55.960 --> 08:57.200
It's what you both deserve.

08:57.840 --> 09:00.400
Did you come to save me?
There's nothing to save here.

09:04.080 --> 09:05.400
Nano, I want to help you.

09:06.960 --> 09:10.440
Don't ask me why, but I can't stand
the idea of something happening to you.

09:12.480 --> 09:16.440
Look. My father's business partner
has an awesome watch collection.

09:17.080 --> 09:20.520
And that jerk deserves
to be robbed way more than my family.

09:21.960 --> 09:26.120
I don't know, with four or five watches,
you could pay off your debt.

09:27.760 --> 09:28.880
What do you think?

09:31.800 --> 09:33.320
I have to get back to work.

09:40.240 --> 09:44.560
Listen, I've been a mess since I told you
that we tried to steal from your house.

09:45.800 --> 09:48.920
I'd totally understand
if you don't want anything to do with me.

09:50.680 --> 09:54.440
I needed to tell you that.
We'll talk tomorrow. Bye.

10:04.520 --> 10:05.480
How are you doing?

10:05.560 --> 10:06.880
-Hi.
-Hi.

10:07.680 --> 10:09.880
Samuel, really, don't worry about that.

10:09.960 --> 10:12.920
Are you sure? I was freaking out.
Are we OK?

10:13.280 --> 10:14.920
We are better than OK.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.080
Listen, Samuel.

10:16.160 --> 10:20.080
I think it's time to take our relationship
to the next level, right?

10:20.160 --> 10:23.600
-What do you mean, the next level?
-To do it... together.

10:26.160 --> 10:27.320
Samu, are you there?

10:33.760 --> 10:34.600
Hi.

10:35.960 --> 10:36.840
Hi, Samuel.

10:37.560 --> 10:38.720
How can I help you?

10:45.200 --> 10:46.240
I need eggs.

10:46.320 --> 10:48.280
What's going on with you guys?

10:49.880 --> 10:51.400
Can we talk outside, man?

10:51.680 --> 10:52.920
My father needs me.

10:53.400 --> 10:54.240
Omar.

11:02.480 --> 11:04.400
Do you know what's going on with them?

11:04.600 --> 11:06.920
Kid stuff.
One day like this, the next like that.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.200
So now you're okay
with talking to drug dealers?

11:09.760 --> 11:10.760
I miss you, man.

11:12.040 --> 11:13.120
Don't you miss me?

11:14.640 --> 11:16.440
I don't need friends who judge me.

11:16.760 --> 11:19.760
Omar, come on. I'm not judging you,
I'm worried about you.

11:20.440 --> 11:21.760
I can't help it.

11:21.840 --> 11:24.680
And this is your way of apologizing?
It sucks.

11:27.280 --> 11:28.120
I'm sorry.

11:29.400 --> 11:30.360
You're forgiven.

11:32.800 --> 11:35.640
-I have something else to tell you.
-What?

11:36.080 --> 11:37.520
Marina wants to do it with me.

11:37.600 --> 11:39.960
-No. Bullshit!
-I'm telling you.

11:40.040 --> 11:42.440
-Does she? Congratulations, man.
-Yeah.

11:43.560 --> 11:45.600
-That's awesome. Cool.
-Well...

11:46.320 --> 11:48.760
So why the long face? That's great news.

11:48.840 --> 11:51.240
-Not great, fucking amazing.
-I know, but...

11:51.320 --> 11:53.960
-Why are you so down?
-Because I'm a virgin.

11:54.720 --> 11:57.240
Omar, it's my first time. I'm embarrassed.

11:57.320 --> 11:59.040
I'm afraid that I won't get it up,

11:59.120 --> 12:02.240
or that I'll get nervous...
and be awkward with her.

12:02.320 --> 12:04.520
No. Just relax.

12:04.600 --> 12:07.880
-Let nature do its thing--
-I'm worried about something else, too.

12:08.400 --> 12:12.760
If I get nervous, I don't want her
to think that it's because of her issue.

12:12.920 --> 12:14.920
-What issue?
-Her HIV, man.

12:16.840 --> 12:19.600
I'm scared she'll think it's
because I'm afraid of it.

12:23.480 --> 12:27.520
-Let me think about it.
-Is there anything you want to tell me?

12:27.600 --> 12:30.880
-Me? No.
-You're not a virgin anymore.

12:32.520 --> 12:36.920
-Sorry, Muslims don't talk about that.
-Sorry, but I'm a bit of a jerk.

12:37.360 --> 12:38.440
Asshole.

12:43.520 --> 12:45.000
-Another fling?
-Hands off.

12:45.080 --> 12:46.080
-Let me see.
-Let go.

12:46.160 --> 12:47.640
-Let me see it.
-Don't be nosy.

12:47.720 --> 12:50.000
-Let me see.
-Stop. I'm going inside.

12:50.080 --> 12:51.560
Go home and start waxing.

12:51.640 --> 12:53.040
-Waxing?
-That's what I said.

12:53.120 --> 12:55.360
Omar! Should I get waxed?

12:59.560 --> 13:01.920
-Sorry I'm late.
-Don't worry.

13:05.600 --> 13:07.520
Worried I wouldn't show up, huh?

13:08.160 --> 13:09.320
Let's get drinks.

13:09.400 --> 13:11.840
Let's act like this isn't our first time
in a gay bar.

13:12.280 --> 13:13.520
Why the hell are we here?

13:13.880 --> 13:16.560
Because there's more to life
than just school and training.

13:16.640 --> 13:18.400
Or meeting up
in out-of-the-way places.

13:19.200 --> 13:22.200
Besides,
I needed to get my mind off tennis.

13:22.840 --> 13:24.640
Plus, I wanted to show you off.

13:27.720 --> 13:29.520
Tennis is driving you crazy, right?

13:30.320 --> 13:31.440
Why don't you quit?

13:31.720 --> 13:35.240
-It's the only thing I'm good at.
-You're not good at anything else, right?

13:36.760 --> 13:38.960
If it isn't your thing,
you'll find something else.

13:39.040 --> 13:41.840
Look. If I quit tennis,
I'll break my dad's heart.

13:41.920 --> 13:43.360
It's your life, not his.

13:43.440 --> 13:46.920
Besides, believe it or not,
no one dies from a broken heart.

13:51.880 --> 13:53.760
Those two guys won't stop staring at us.

13:54.280 --> 13:56.600
Obviously. We're the hottest ones here.

14:19.400 --> 14:21.440
Enough with the pics, Narcissus.

14:21.520 --> 14:25.360
Narcissus? How could I not be like him?
Have you seen these pics? Look.

14:25.800 --> 14:28.400
I've got a gift, man. I'm killing it.

14:28.800 --> 14:29.640
Listen.

14:32.640 --> 14:36.160
I have an idea about how to convince
your father that you're not being bought.

14:36.240 --> 14:38.680
-What if I get you a job?
-What do you mean, a job?

14:38.760 --> 14:42.600
I don't want a shitty dishwasher job.
I'll have time for that later.

14:42.680 --> 14:45.600
No, Christian. It's nothing like that.
Look.

14:46.040 --> 14:49.360
Have I told you that my mom
is one of the most important CEOs

14:49.440 --> 14:52.520
-in the publishing world?
-Maybe, but I don't recall.

14:52.600 --> 14:53.720
I'm bad at acronyms.

14:53.800 --> 14:55.720
That means chief executive officer.

14:55.960 --> 14:59.920
She's working on one of this season's
most important ad campaigns.

15:00.000 --> 15:01.600
-They're looking for models.
-So?

15:02.440 --> 15:05.120
-I can tell her to get you in.
-You'd do that for me?

15:05.360 --> 15:09.120
-I'll call her.
-You're great, man!

15:09.520 --> 15:13.840
Against feminine men
and those who defended women's rights.

15:13.920 --> 15:18.160
Over time,
those men who defended women's rights...

15:18.640 --> 15:21.160
and mainly women,
reappropriated that word,

15:21.320 --> 15:24.480
starting with the pioneer
and suffragist Hubertine Auclert.

15:24.880 --> 15:28.520
Thus, this word has lost its stigma
over time...

15:28.600 --> 15:30.800
-The phone, please.
-Sorry, it was my mom.

15:30.880 --> 15:33.040
This way, we can share with the class...

15:33.120 --> 15:34.800
-Give me the phone.
-It was my mom.

15:34.880 --> 15:37.200
You know the rules.
I don't care. Give me the phone.

15:37.280 --> 15:39.240
She wants to know
what time I'm getting out.

15:39.880 --> 15:41.240
Nadia, please read.

15:41.880 --> 15:43.280
-Read.
-No.

15:44.880 --> 15:46.880
"Marina doesn't have AIDS, asshole.

15:47.440 --> 15:49.160
-It's HIV--"
-Stop reading that!

15:49.240 --> 15:50.280
What the hell?

15:50.920 --> 15:53.800
Guzmán, calm down. Enough, Guzmán!

15:53.880 --> 15:56.160
-What are you writing?
-Calm down!

15:56.240 --> 15:59.160
-How could you let her read it?
-First, show me some respect.

15:59.240 --> 16:01.040
Second, you know the rules.

16:01.120 --> 16:03.440
You can't use phones.
I had the right to do that.

16:03.520 --> 16:05.160
-A hell of a right you had.
-Shut up.

16:07.600 --> 16:09.120
Marina, do you have HIV?

16:09.200 --> 16:10.600
Nadia, please.

16:10.680 --> 16:12.880
-Really, I don't get it.
-What's that?

16:14.560 --> 16:15.520
No.

16:15.600 --> 16:18.520
Guys, please, calm down. Now!

16:22.560 --> 16:25.000
Marina, you don't have to say anything.
Please, don't.

16:25.080 --> 16:27.080
Guzmán, stop. Please.

16:31.600 --> 16:34.640
I caught it a year and a half ago,
more or less.

16:36.760 --> 16:38.480
And, well... I guess...

16:39.240 --> 16:42.160
this will be a trending topic for a while.

16:43.080 --> 16:47.000
To make sure you're informed
about what you'll be talking about,

16:47.960 --> 16:51.320
I'll tell you, really,
you don't need to worry about me.

16:52.280 --> 16:54.000
I take my medication.

16:55.520 --> 16:58.040
I take tests every four months, and...

16:58.720 --> 17:01.880
the virus I have is undetectable
in the blood, so...

17:02.280 --> 17:04.640
that means that you can't get infected.

17:15.560 --> 17:19.440
Thanks, Marina.
It takes a lot of courage to share this.

17:22.720 --> 17:24.160
Don't you think so, Nadia?

17:24.880 --> 17:26.320
I'd rather not comment.

17:27.720 --> 17:29.480
I don't want to hurt anyone.

17:35.000 --> 17:36.040
Here, man.

17:38.720 --> 17:40.840
It was Pablo who infected her, right?

17:43.120 --> 17:45.200
What? What did I miss?

17:46.680 --> 17:47.640
Did you know?

17:49.320 --> 17:53.160
-Did you tell him and not me?
-He told me when he was really down.

17:53.560 --> 17:55.560
-And because I was there.
-Yeah.

17:57.240 --> 18:01.240
-That's why you can't stand the new kids?
-Those people are nothing but trouble.

18:01.320 --> 18:04.640
You can't judge all of them
based on what one individual did.

18:04.720 --> 18:05.920
Polo, say what you want.

18:06.000 --> 18:09.080
But Christian's using you and won't stop.
Why would he?

18:09.160 --> 18:13.120
Some people have a plan to use others.
They know how to get what they want.

18:13.440 --> 18:16.720
-What are you talking about?
-Do you want to tell him, or should I?

18:17.480 --> 18:18.320
What?

18:19.520 --> 18:21.360
Polo and Carla are experimenting
with Christian.

18:21.440 --> 18:23.800
I keep telling him the risks,
but he won't listen.

18:23.880 --> 18:27.000
I knew that already.
He told me himself at Samuel's party.

18:27.080 --> 18:29.080
-He told you at the party?
-See?

18:29.160 --> 18:30.640
For fuck's sake!

18:30.720 --> 18:32.520
He's telling everyone
because he wants to use you.

18:32.600 --> 18:34.760
He wants to fuck you over. Period.

18:36.400 --> 18:37.680
Nobody uses me.

18:38.720 --> 18:39.960
He won't use me.

18:50.560 --> 18:52.520
When we were little, we were good friends.

18:55.200 --> 18:56.120
Hi.

18:57.280 --> 18:58.320
Can I sit?

18:58.400 --> 18:59.400
Sure, silly.

19:01.160 --> 19:04.400
But then,
we drifted apart and we barely spoke.

19:05.120 --> 19:06.480
How are you doing?

19:08.280 --> 19:09.240
You know...

19:10.240 --> 19:12.080
I really think you were brave.

19:12.720 --> 19:15.440
And I'm sorry you had to go through
all this by yourself.

19:15.520 --> 19:19.800
Don't worry. I had Guzmán and my parents.

19:20.080 --> 19:23.600
Besides, it's been a long time
since we were close, so...

19:23.720 --> 19:26.320
But you can always count on me.
You know that, right?

19:26.920 --> 19:30.880
So, you didn't notice any changes,
anything unusual?

19:32.240 --> 19:34.160
I could really use a friend.

19:34.480 --> 19:36.000
I told you, we didn't talk.

19:37.400 --> 19:40.640
I need so many things right now...

19:41.680 --> 19:43.320
To talk, to vent...

19:43.400 --> 19:45.080
I totally understand.

19:45.360 --> 19:47.640
Would you like to meet up later?

19:47.720 --> 19:50.760
-At your house or...
-Sure. At my house. Great.

19:50.920 --> 19:51.800
OK.

19:59.000 --> 20:00.120
Yes, it's me.

20:03.200 --> 20:04.040
Hi.

20:05.400 --> 20:06.640
I couldn't find you.

20:06.920 --> 20:09.760
-How are you doing?
-What are you doing here?

20:10.080 --> 20:12.840
I couldn't stand any more pitying
or condescending looks.

20:14.240 --> 20:16.000
Did you see how Nadia stared at me?

20:16.440 --> 20:18.640
I was making a friend,
and I've already lost her.

20:19.800 --> 20:23.200
I'm sorry. You had to say it
in front of everyone because of me.

20:23.600 --> 20:25.680
It had to happen sooner or later.

20:26.760 --> 20:27.640
And...

20:30.800 --> 20:32.480
do you know when you think that...

20:32.760 --> 20:36.360
you're brave,
but the truth is you act like a coward?

20:36.640 --> 20:39.880
Saying it in front of the class like that
wasn't a cowardly thing to do.

20:39.960 --> 20:42.240
Samuel,
I'm only brave when I'm forced to be.

20:43.240 --> 20:45.320
So in the end, I have to thank you.

20:49.560 --> 20:52.800
And... are you really afraid
of being with me because I have HIV?

20:53.360 --> 20:55.280
That doesn't scare me at all, OK?

20:56.120 --> 20:57.040
OK.

20:59.120 --> 21:01.720
I'm afraid that you'll compare me
to your ex.

21:02.160 --> 21:03.160
What?

21:03.840 --> 21:07.040
Or any guy you've been with,
and that you'll realize I'm just a kid.

21:07.120 --> 21:10.760
-Samuel, we are the same age.
-Sure, but we're from different worlds.

21:10.840 --> 21:11.760
What worlds?

21:11.840 --> 21:14.880
People from your world have lived
like seven lives more than I have.

21:15.640 --> 21:17.440
Samuel, you're a sweetheart.

21:18.520 --> 21:22.680
-I could do it right here.
-No. No, our first time has to be great.

21:22.760 --> 21:24.640
-And it will!
-Let me set it up.

21:25.680 --> 21:27.080
Calm down.

21:42.880 --> 21:46.520
-Hi.
-What are you doing here?

21:47.520 --> 21:49.080
I came to see you.

21:53.800 --> 21:55.440
You were a bit harsh in class,

21:55.520 --> 21:59.160
-with everything that happened.
-You didn't tell me about your sister.

22:00.920 --> 22:03.360
That's her business. I didn't tell anyone.

22:04.120 --> 22:06.880
You didn't do anything, either.
I thought you were friends.

22:07.800 --> 22:09.600
I didn't say anything
because I care about her.

22:10.080 --> 22:11.800
-If it were anyone else...
-What?

22:16.480 --> 22:19.480
-Nothing. It doesn't matter.
-What's going on, Nadia?

22:23.560 --> 22:26.120
This only makes me see
how different we are.

22:26.760 --> 22:28.840
I don't know why I'm with people like you.

22:28.920 --> 22:29.920
People like me?

22:30.480 --> 22:31.800
What does that mean?

22:35.880 --> 22:38.640
You tried to win a bet at my expense.

22:39.640 --> 22:43.560
Then, you tell me about your father
snorting coke in the cellars.

22:43.880 --> 22:45.840
And now, your sister with HIV.

22:46.000 --> 22:47.920
And you say that our culture is archaic.

22:48.000 --> 22:50.040
So your family's perfect,
everything's great?

22:50.120 --> 22:52.960
No, I'm not saying that we're perfect,
nor that it's great.

22:53.360 --> 22:55.520
But we don't have
those kinds of problems.

22:55.600 --> 22:56.840
Those kinds of problems.

22:58.320 --> 22:59.160
Hello.

23:03.520 --> 23:06.160
Yes, that will be €1.50, please.

23:06.240 --> 23:07.800
-Thanks.
-See you.

23:19.600 --> 23:23.200
Do you know what your brother is up to?
He deals drugs and sucks cock.

23:25.040 --> 23:26.080
Have a nice day.

23:30.640 --> 23:33.360
-What did he want?
-Nothing.

23:39.080 --> 23:42.400
-Carla, thanks for everything.
-No worries. It's the least I could do.

23:47.200 --> 23:48.400
Let's have a drink.

23:49.640 --> 23:50.480
Yeah, sure.

23:54.120 --> 23:55.400
Beer or wine?

23:55.800 --> 23:58.320
My mother speaks highly
of the last harvest.

23:58.400 --> 24:00.360
-Wine it is, then.
-Great.

24:04.480 --> 24:06.160
Shit, there's none left.

24:06.640 --> 24:09.400
-I'll go to the cellar for another one.
-OK.

24:09.560 --> 24:10.760
I'll be right back.

24:24.560 --> 24:27.760
If my mom finds out I've opened
one of the good ones, she'll kill me.

24:29.000 --> 24:30.200
Marina?

24:31.040 --> 24:34.440
It looks exactly the same.
It's been a long time since I last came.

24:35.440 --> 24:37.480
It's still the same mausoleum.

24:40.000 --> 24:44.920
-Well, here's to...
-To friendship in shitty times.

24:47.080 --> 24:48.040
Thank you.

24:52.440 --> 24:53.640
Omar, can we talk?

24:54.840 --> 24:55.720
Yeah.

24:58.280 --> 25:01.520
I don't know how to ask you this,
so I'll do it quick.

25:02.960 --> 25:04.000
Are you dealing drugs?

25:06.000 --> 25:07.120
Who told you that?

25:10.280 --> 25:12.560
Samuel. That fucking son of a bitch!

25:12.800 --> 25:14.560
Samuel knows? So it's true?

25:15.840 --> 25:17.360
I'm going to stop, don't worry.

25:17.440 --> 25:20.080
What were you thinking,
getting involved with that? Why?

25:27.080 --> 25:29.040
Do you know you can talk to me?

25:30.480 --> 25:31.520
About anything.

25:32.720 --> 25:36.360
I don't know, Nadia.
We've never really been the kind to talk.

25:38.080 --> 25:40.920
I know. But you can talk to me.

25:41.440 --> 25:42.400
About anything.

25:42.920 --> 25:45.800
I promise I'll listen to you...
and help you.

25:46.560 --> 25:48.760
Great. I'm going to do my homework.

25:49.040 --> 25:50.480
Take care of the store.

25:52.440 --> 25:54.320
And... there is something else, right?

26:00.760 --> 26:01.840
Do you like guys?

26:04.880 --> 26:07.840
Listen, if you do,
you'll distance yourself from Mom and Dad.

26:07.920 --> 26:10.120
With everything they've done for us!

26:10.320 --> 26:14.320
-I have the right to live my own life.
-Set it aside for a couple of years!

26:14.400 --> 26:16.040
It can't be that difficult.

26:17.040 --> 26:18.200
Look at me.

26:19.280 --> 26:21.280
I'm not an ice cube like you.

26:32.200 --> 26:33.040
Guzmán.

26:34.240 --> 26:35.080
Hey.

26:37.000 --> 26:37.880
Hey!

26:40.160 --> 26:41.000
Surprise!

26:42.000 --> 26:43.240
What are you doing here?

26:43.320 --> 26:46.800
Is the alcohol in the usual place?
I can make the best margaritas.

26:49.600 --> 26:52.040
Lu... I don't feel like it.

26:52.600 --> 26:54.360
I get it. It's normal.

26:55.120 --> 26:59.640
You've protected Marina your whole life,
and now this.

27:00.400 --> 27:02.280
You need to get your mind off it.

27:02.360 --> 27:04.200
Someone who gets you,
who doesn't judge.

27:04.280 --> 27:06.160
I'm here to listen, you know.

27:06.240 --> 27:09.120
We can watch a movie...

27:09.200 --> 27:10.320
-How about it?
-Lu.

27:10.960 --> 27:12.400
I'm not in the mood, OK?

27:12.720 --> 27:13.920
I want to be alone.

27:17.920 --> 27:19.560
Don't you miss what we had?

27:21.280 --> 27:23.680
I'm not talking about the sex, that aside.

27:24.840 --> 27:26.320
I'm talking about us.

27:27.520 --> 27:28.400
You and me.

27:29.040 --> 27:31.680
You get me better than anyone,
and I get you.

27:33.280 --> 27:34.520
We're a team.

27:40.360 --> 27:42.720
I won't allow us to lose that.

27:46.160 --> 27:47.640
-Sorry.
-Sure.

27:49.200 --> 27:51.320
Hi, Guzmán, I just wanted...

27:52.120 --> 27:53.240
to apologize.

27:53.760 --> 27:55.960
I know I've been harsh, and I'm sorry.

28:00.640 --> 28:01.720
I'm done, Lu.

28:04.560 --> 28:05.400
Lu?

28:10.280 --> 28:12.920
Here we go again. What?

28:13.520 --> 28:15.320
-What?
-Get out of the pool room.

28:15.400 --> 28:17.400
-I can't hear you.
-Fine, I'm coming.

28:20.240 --> 28:21.480
Lu, not now.

28:23.280 --> 28:25.880
I just think you're really boring.

28:26.600 --> 28:28.360
Can you stop fooling around, please?

28:29.520 --> 28:31.440
Besides, we're not alone.

28:31.840 --> 28:34.480
I'm turning one of your worst days...

28:34.920 --> 28:35.920
into a good one.

28:37.160 --> 28:38.520
-Bye.
-No!

28:41.400 --> 28:42.360
No way!

28:44.080 --> 28:46.600
-Come in with me!
-No, Lu. I don't want to.

28:46.800 --> 28:49.040
Just for a little while. Don't be boring!

28:49.120 --> 28:50.840
I want you to leave.

28:53.600 --> 28:56.840
OK, then. Help me get out.
I can't swim with shoes on.

28:57.520 --> 28:59.720
-Don't do what you're thinking about.
-I won't.

29:02.920 --> 29:04.120
I knew it.

29:04.720 --> 29:08.960
Of course you knew. You know why?
Because you can't help it.

29:09.920 --> 29:13.680
Because we can hook up with other people,
we can be with other people,

29:14.160 --> 29:17.600
but you and me...
will always be you and me, honey.

29:18.880 --> 29:21.160
Right? Come on, give me a kiss.

29:21.560 --> 29:23.720
-No.
-Kiss me.

29:49.880 --> 29:51.800
Tomorrow, the house will be empty, OK?

29:51.880 --> 29:53.920
Her parents are away.
Carla will be in class.

29:54.000 --> 29:56.760
The code for the alarm is 1-6-4-9.

29:56.840 --> 29:58.600
I'll text it to you later.

29:58.680 --> 30:03.040
To get the watches, go up the stairs
to her parents' bedroom.

30:03.240 --> 30:05.640
There is a bathroom
with a dressing room inside.

30:05.720 --> 30:08.360
In the dressing room,
there'll be some drawers,

30:08.440 --> 30:09.880
and the watches will be there.

30:14.840 --> 30:16.680
1-6-4-9.

30:16.920 --> 30:18.040
That's it.

30:18.800 --> 30:20.400
-Bye.
-Bye.

30:22.920 --> 30:24.360
-They told me to come.
-Really?

30:24.440 --> 30:27.520
-I'm telling you.
-What a nice chat you're having.

30:27.600 --> 30:29.720
He has a casting call tomorrow.

30:30.520 --> 30:31.880
Did you set it up?

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
Yeah, with my mother.

30:35.560 --> 30:38.200
Of course you did. Thanks so much, man!

30:38.280 --> 30:40.520
By the way, I don't know what to wear.

30:40.600 --> 30:43.600
Well, the less you wear
and the more you show, the better.

30:44.000 --> 30:47.040
Don't you think, Polo?
You like him better undressed, right?

30:48.040 --> 30:50.600
-What are you talking about?
-Let's go to class.

30:51.800 --> 30:52.920
Thanks a lot.

30:54.160 --> 30:55.040
You're welcome.

30:57.560 --> 30:59.920
LET ME KNOW WHEN YOU GET THEM.

31:00.160 --> 31:04.120
-No! Did you get it?
-You know me.

31:04.200 --> 31:05.240
What's going on?

31:05.920 --> 31:07.720
Nothing, Lu was telling me...

31:08.640 --> 31:11.280
-She gets everything she wants.
-Don't say anything.

31:11.360 --> 31:13.600
-What?
-I'm talking about Martín.

31:13.760 --> 31:15.960
She has him eating out of the palm
of her hand.

31:16.040 --> 31:16.880
Martín? Why?

31:17.440 --> 31:18.560
-Tell her.
-No.

31:18.640 --> 31:19.760
I'll tell you myself.

31:19.840 --> 31:24.480
She got him connections in the embassy
to expedite the adoption process.

31:25.080 --> 31:26.200
Seriously?

31:26.480 --> 31:29.160
Yes, I'm his favorite again. As always.

31:30.320 --> 31:33.120
Poor thing,
he was going about it the honest way,

31:33.200 --> 31:36.600
but when you don't have money,
honesty's a luxury you can't afford.

31:37.960 --> 31:38.920
Yeah.

31:39.000 --> 31:41.960
Oh, Marina!
I'm really happy we're friends again.

32:17.120 --> 32:18.160
Fucking great!

32:26.720 --> 32:30.440
Don't you tell me...
That's a fucking bummer.

32:34.240 --> 32:35.200
Damn girl...

32:35.800 --> 32:38.840
Nothing to do all day.
They don't even let you use the Internet.

32:47.160 --> 32:48.440
They needed to spice it up.

32:56.680 --> 32:59.240
Not at all.
I'm not sure why I wanted to go there.

32:59.320 --> 33:01.440
I'm taking a shower,
and I'll be right there.

33:01.520 --> 33:03.360
OK? See you in a bit.

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
I'VE GOT THEM.

33:59.360 --> 34:00.720
Shit!

34:06.040 --> 34:08.280
-Are you going to tell us?
-Tell you what?

34:08.360 --> 34:11.840
-Carla and Lu tell each other everything.
-It was nothing. Just a mistake.

34:12.200 --> 34:14.520
A mistake, period. Please, drop it.

34:14.600 --> 34:16.120
-A mistake?
-A mistake.

34:16.200 --> 34:17.640
-OK.
-Please.

34:18.360 --> 34:19.280
OK.

34:19.920 --> 34:20.800
It's your friend.

34:22.080 --> 34:22.960
Hey.

34:24.480 --> 34:28.200
How are you doing?
Aren't you going to say hi?

34:28.480 --> 34:31.800
-I didn't know they'd be here.
-Should I tell them to sit?

34:32.480 --> 34:35.400
-It's fucking obvious.
-So what if they see us talking?

34:36.200 --> 34:38.880
-I wanna kiss you.
-Are you drunk or something?

34:38.960 --> 34:40.840
-No.
-Ander, come sit.

34:42.320 --> 34:43.400
-Come.
-Come on, sit.

34:46.080 --> 34:47.320
-How are you doing?
-Fine.

34:47.400 --> 34:49.680
OK. Look, I wanted to say...

34:49.760 --> 34:52.360
as long as you don't sell any shit
to my friend, we're OK.

34:52.440 --> 34:55.520
I support you.
Gay power and all that, OK?

34:55.600 --> 34:57.440
-What are you doing?
-What do you think?

34:59.600 --> 35:02.760
-Don't go. I'm giving you my blessing.
-Who asked for your blessing?

35:02.840 --> 35:05.120
-Don't leave, please.
-Omar!

35:05.440 --> 35:07.560
Blessing?
It's not like you're their best man.

35:10.000 --> 35:11.560
Omar, they're my friends.

35:11.640 --> 35:13.680
-Hi. What's wrong?
-Omar!

35:15.760 --> 35:18.040
-How are you doing?
-Hi.

35:22.720 --> 35:24.720
-What?
-I'm a bit nervous.

35:25.280 --> 35:27.640
-Don't be. Why?
-I don't know.

35:28.280 --> 35:30.240
-Wait for me. I'm out in five minutes.
-OK.

35:30.320 --> 35:31.240
See you in a bit.

35:35.960 --> 35:37.920
Omar, let's just talk about it.

35:41.000 --> 35:44.480
Why did you tell people we're together?
No, no.

35:44.560 --> 35:47.200
Besides, where did you even get that idea?

35:47.280 --> 35:49.840
-They're my friends.
-We're not together!

35:50.280 --> 35:52.600
It's not happening, Ander.
Not now, not ever.

35:54.720 --> 35:59.720
-I don't get why you're acting like this.
-Because I can't do this.

36:00.160 --> 36:03.160
Too many people know.
Even my sister, man.

36:03.560 --> 36:07.720
And you don't know my family.
If they knew, I'd break their hearts.

36:09.240 --> 36:13.400
-I thought nobody dies of a broken heart.
-Hi.

36:14.600 --> 36:15.520
Omar, right?

36:15.600 --> 36:18.920
-Yeah.
-Can you sell me something?

36:19.000 --> 36:20.840
I think we might need it.

36:23.600 --> 36:26.160
-How much?
-It's on the house.

36:26.640 --> 36:27.960
But be careful with it.

36:28.040 --> 36:30.920
It's strong,
and we don't want you to get sick.

36:32.120 --> 36:32.960
Thanks.

36:36.800 --> 36:37.680
Everything OK?

36:40.120 --> 36:41.000
Yes.

36:51.640 --> 36:52.560
Wait.

36:56.440 --> 36:58.160
What do you think?
Are the lights too much?

36:59.200 --> 37:00.280
No, it's nice.

37:10.720 --> 37:13.160
I've got pot. You want some?

37:13.240 --> 37:14.920
-No, we're fine.
-OK.

37:28.840 --> 37:30.320
-Samuel...
-What?

37:31.000 --> 37:32.080
More slowly.

37:32.480 --> 37:33.320
OK.

37:39.760 --> 37:40.640
Fuck!

37:41.040 --> 37:42.320
What? Just relax.

37:42.840 --> 37:44.400
I can't believe this.

37:45.800 --> 37:46.960
I'm fucking it up.

37:48.000 --> 37:49.680
-I'm fucking up.
-Lay down.

38:02.600 --> 38:03.720
Samuel.

38:04.280 --> 38:05.200
Yes?

38:06.440 --> 38:07.640
I want to love you.

38:33.960 --> 38:36.520
-Sorry.
-Relax.

38:36.920 --> 38:38.440
-Sorry.
-It's all right.

38:40.200 --> 38:42.160
I wasn't so bad, right?

38:43.040 --> 38:44.880
No. You were great.

38:45.680 --> 38:46.560
Really great.

38:48.160 --> 38:49.840
Samuel, I should leave soon.

38:52.200 --> 38:56.600
-My mom works tonight.
-Yes, but they're expecting me for dinner.

39:10.480 --> 39:17.240
Don't freak out, but someone broke in.
They took the watches and...

39:19.480 --> 39:21.120
they took mine, too.

39:23.880 --> 39:25.920
Yes, everything is in there.

39:27.640 --> 39:30.520
-What's all this?
-I have enough to pay it all off.

39:30.600 --> 39:31.720
Where did you get them?

39:31.800 --> 39:34.120
-Let's say Marina helped me open a door.
-What?

39:34.200 --> 39:36.560
Why did you drag her into this?

39:37.080 --> 39:39.160
Fuck! Why did she get involved?

39:39.240 --> 39:41.680
Because she loves you. Why else?

39:42.240 --> 39:45.800
I'm telling you, it's going to be okay.
So be happy for me,

39:45.880 --> 39:49.480
because I'm fixing everything with this.
It's about time.

39:49.800 --> 39:52.520
Pun intended. This one's for you.

39:52.600 --> 39:54.400
-Put it away.
-It smells like rich people.

39:54.480 --> 39:55.320
OK.

39:56.440 --> 39:57.440
Man.

40:16.000 --> 40:18.240
<i>I just wanted to make sure</i>
<i>you got home safe.</i>

40:19.280 --> 40:20.400
I had a great time.

40:22.080 --> 40:23.800
We can talk before going to bed.

40:24.400 --> 40:25.240
<i>Bye.</i>

41:15.760 --> 41:16.680
Hi, Guzmán.

41:17.120 --> 41:17.960
Hi.

41:18.040 --> 41:20.640
How is your sister?
She didn't come to the first class.

41:21.200 --> 41:24.200
-I guess she overslept. I'm not sure.
-Look who it is.

41:25.800 --> 41:30.440
You were great in your pool last night.
Sometimes I forget how good we are in bed.

41:30.520 --> 41:32.480
So you did it to tell everyone, right?

41:32.720 --> 41:36.480
-You don't surprise me anymore, Lu.
-Was it a secret?

41:36.760 --> 41:40.200
Well, I thought there were no secrets
between friends.

41:41.000 --> 41:42.080
See you later.

41:44.560 --> 41:45.400
Nadia...

41:45.480 --> 41:48.280
-Don't worry.
-It was nothing.

41:49.720 --> 41:51.600
-Just you?
-Yes.

41:51.880 --> 41:52.720
Hey.

41:53.200 --> 41:55.880
I called three times.
My name wasn't on the casting list.

41:58.840 --> 42:02.080
In the end, it didn't work out.
My mom wasn't sure about you. Sorry.

42:02.600 --> 42:04.160
Yeah, fucking great.

42:05.520 --> 42:07.080
Did you really ruin that for him?

42:07.720 --> 42:11.240
Yeah.
What's wrong? I don't owe him anything.

42:11.320 --> 42:15.320
Besides, I'm tired of him using us.
He wants to take advantage of us.

42:15.400 --> 42:17.120
Like we're not using him?

42:17.200 --> 42:18.880
What's really bothering you?

42:19.680 --> 42:21.360
He only wants us for one thing.

42:21.640 --> 42:23.680
-Right.
-In fact, he only wants you.

42:24.200 --> 42:25.280
You're jealous.

42:25.680 --> 42:26.960
What are you saying?

42:29.680 --> 42:30.520
Marina.

42:32.920 --> 42:34.000
How are you doing?

42:34.200 --> 42:37.440
I kept calling you last night.
I called you this morning, too.

42:37.520 --> 42:38.400
Is everything OK?

42:38.480 --> 42:41.080
Yeah, I was just tired, and my phone died.

42:42.840 --> 42:43.720
Sure.

42:45.400 --> 42:48.760
Sure what, Samuel?
You don't believe me?

42:48.840 --> 42:52.040
It's not that. I'm starting
to get the feeling you're avoiding me.

42:52.120 --> 42:56.600
-Don't get paranoid, Samuel.
-Paranoid about what?

42:56.680 --> 42:58.480
I'm starting to feel like an idiot.

42:58.960 --> 43:00.600
If something is going on, don't lie.

43:00.680 --> 43:02.760
The only thing I can't stand
is being lied to.

43:06.760 --> 43:10.360
That's the only thing you can't stand?
Lies?

43:11.480 --> 43:13.400
Fuck, you can't stand much!

43:13.720 --> 43:16.800
Because lies make life easier.

43:17.640 --> 43:20.640
To avoid pain, to avoid suffering.
To avoid hurting people.

43:22.440 --> 43:24.640
-Drop it.
-I'm not sure... Marina!

43:25.800 --> 43:26.920
Marina!

43:31.760 --> 43:32.720
Marina!

44:11.000 --> 44:13.560
That's my boy.
I didn't expect any less from you.

45:11.600 --> 45:12.480
Marina!

45:12.640 --> 45:14.000
Marina, are you OK?

45:14.560 --> 45:16.920
-Fuck!
-Why did you argue?

45:17.600 --> 45:20.120
I'd never been close to anyone
with HIV.

45:20.880 --> 45:23.240
Marina!

45:23.600 --> 45:26.360
Marina. What happened?
What are you doing? Go get help!

45:26.440 --> 45:28.520
Marina, look at me.

45:28.600 --> 45:29.520
Martín!

45:29.600 --> 45:31.600
Look at me!

45:31.680 --> 45:34.280
Move over, I've got this. Come on.

45:35.080 --> 45:36.640
Can you hear me? Look at me.

45:37.120 --> 45:39.960
Look at me. Follow my finger, please.

45:40.040 --> 45:41.240
Marina!

45:41.720 --> 45:44.280
Fuck, look at those pupils. Damn it.

45:44.760 --> 45:47.240
What did you take, Marina?
What did you take?

45:48.000 --> 45:49.440
What happened with Marina?

45:52.560 --> 45:56.800
You know this means immediate expulsion?
We have a zero-tolerance drug policy.

45:56.880 --> 45:58.840
-No, don't.
-I'm taking you to the nurse.

45:58.920 --> 46:00.600
-I don't want to.
-We're going.

46:00.680 --> 46:02.520
I'm fine. I'm perfectly fine.

46:04.240 --> 46:06.240
Are you sure
you didn't have a relationship

46:06.320 --> 46:07.720
with Marina outside of class?

46:08.040 --> 46:09.760
No, of course not.

46:09.840 --> 46:12.200
I'm taking her to the hospital.
Tell administration.

46:12.280 --> 46:15.160
-Let's go.
-Martín, no! No!

46:21.080 --> 46:22.640
If you tell anyone,

46:22.720 --> 46:25.640
I'll tell them about your deal with Lu.
The adoption.

46:31.160 --> 46:32.200
Wait.

46:41.280 --> 46:43.680
Of course,
it's not fair what they did to her.

46:44.080 --> 46:45.440
No one deserves that.

46:49.360 --> 46:50.920
Did you hate Marina?

48:08.560 --> 48:11.320
