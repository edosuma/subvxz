WEBVTT

00:01.601 --> 00:03.604
I've never had a real
relationship, Wade.

00:03.637 --> 00:04.405
I don't know how to do it.
Me neither.

00:04.438 --> 00:06.440
Sometimes, you just
got to wing it.

00:06.474 --> 00:08.076
We're gonna drive
each other crazy sometimes.

00:08.109 --> 00:09.343
But you got to remember,
that's part of what brought us

00:09.377 --> 00:10.711
together in the first place.

00:10.744 --> 00:12.346
Well, hello, Doctor.

00:12.380 --> 00:13.481
BRICK:
 Shelby was

00:13.514 --> 00:14.715
a midlife crisis.

00:14.748 --> 00:18.252
But she made me feel more alive
than I've felt in 13 years.

00:18.286 --> 00:19.387
If you want to be with Shelby,

00:19.420 --> 00:20.688
screw it,
be with Shelby.

00:20.721 --> 00:22.123
To be honest with you,
there is

00:22.156 --> 00:24.158
only one girl that I want
to have a date with.

00:24.192 --> 00:27.228
How's Tansy?
She's-she's good.
Uh... we-we are good.

00:27.261 --> 00:28.462
How about you and Wade?

00:28.496 --> 00:29.497
Heard you made that official.

00:29.530 --> 00:30.798
(both laugh)

00:30.831 --> 00:32.400
Life in BlueBell.

00:35.703 --> 00:37.705
(sighs)

00:43.611 --> 00:45.313
Cured sausage.

00:46.347 --> 00:48.449
Okay.

00:48.482 --> 00:49.850
You left a message
on my machine.

00:49.883 --> 00:52.220
Said you wanted
cured sausage, yeah?

00:52.253 --> 00:53.454
(laughs)

00:53.487 --> 00:57.425
No, I said I wanted to see
that movie, Coeur Sauvage.

00:57.458 --> 00:59.460
It won Best
Foreign Film.

00:59.493 --> 01:01.395
With Kristin Scott Thomas and
that guy from The Artist.

01:01.429 --> 01:03.631
They go on their honeymoon
and then they're sent back

01:03.664 --> 01:05.099
accidentally in time

01:05.132 --> 01:06.234
to the Warsaw Ghetto.

01:06.267 --> 01:08.136
It's supposed to be
really funny.

01:08.169 --> 01:09.803
Yeah, well...

01:09.837 --> 01:11.272
enjoy that.

01:11.305 --> 01:12.840
No, but I want to go with you.

01:12.873 --> 01:15.576
Why? What did I do to you?

01:15.609 --> 01:16.810
You made me go
to that stupid race.

01:16.844 --> 01:18.279
What race?

01:18.312 --> 01:19.813
The one with the
really bad drivers?

01:19.847 --> 01:22.583
No, no, that was
a demolition derby.

01:22.616 --> 01:23.817
Oh.

01:23.851 --> 01:25.786
Well, the point is

01:25.819 --> 01:27.788
I didn't want to go,
but we're a couple now,

01:27.821 --> 01:30.391
so I went anyways,
'cause that's what couples do.

01:30.424 --> 01:32.126
Things they hate?

01:32.160 --> 01:33.761
All the time!

01:33.794 --> 01:35.663
You know, it-it could
be good for us.

01:35.696 --> 01:38.399
Who knows, you might even find
something that you like in life,

01:38.432 --> 01:40.201
other than cars and beer.

01:41.235 --> 01:42.803
You really think
I'm that shallow?

01:42.836 --> 01:45.706
I'm sorry-- and naked women.

01:45.739 --> 01:47.475
Thank you. Come on.

01:48.509 --> 01:49.610
(Zoe laughs)

01:49.643 --> 01:50.744
Speaking of naked women...

01:50.778 --> 01:53.414
Oh...
Yeah...

01:59.287 --> 02:00.888
Now what?

02:03.257 --> 02:05.626
(sighs)

02:05.659 --> 02:06.627
Oh!
Oh! Sorry.

02:06.660 --> 02:07.761
Lemon!

02:07.795 --> 02:08.795
Blame my father.

02:08.829 --> 02:10.497
He stood me up twice
in one week.

02:10.531 --> 02:12.766
Well, what if I had been
old Mrs. Hodge that you

02:12.800 --> 02:13.867
barreled into
out here?

02:13.901 --> 02:14.902
They'd be finding
pieces of her

02:14.935 --> 02:16.337
for weeks!

02:17.505 --> 02:18.572
Oh.

02:18.606 --> 02:19.907
Ooh.
Pardon me.

02:19.940 --> 02:21.242
Go this way...

02:21.275 --> 02:22.576
Hmm.
(laughs)

02:22.610 --> 02:23.611
(sighing):
Yeah...

02:25.913 --> 02:28.316
You know, there are
many wonders in this world,

02:28.349 --> 02:30.351
but its greatest mystery
might just be

02:30.384 --> 02:32.486
the, uh,
the Butter Stick Bakery's

02:32.520 --> 02:35.189
stunning and impenetrable

02:35.223 --> 02:37.291
Gates of the Two Sirens.

02:37.325 --> 02:38.792
(chuckles)

02:39.827 --> 02:41.795
Impenetrable?

02:41.829 --> 02:43.597
We'll see about that.

02:43.631 --> 02:44.732
AnnaBeth!

02:44.765 --> 02:46.767
Hmm?
Where are you going?

02:48.636 --> 02:50.438
Crickett, I have
never told you this,

02:50.471 --> 02:53.207
but in my soul,
I have always believed

02:53.241 --> 02:55.843
that I would meet
a dashing English gentleman

02:55.876 --> 02:58.379
right out of
a Jane Austen novel.

02:58.412 --> 02:59.713
(laughs)
In BlueBell?

02:59.747 --> 03:00.914
Mm-hmm.

03:00.948 --> 03:02.850
Good luck with that.
(giggles)

03:14.027 --> 03:15.829
Well, I can't wait
to see you tonight.

03:15.863 --> 03:16.797
(chuckles)

03:16.830 --> 03:19.433
I'll wait at Candlewood
Suites out on Royal,

03:19.467 --> 03:21.535
and I'll call your house
at 8:00 sharp and say

03:21.569 --> 03:22.903
that I'm a tourist
who had a bad clam,

03:22.936 --> 03:24.772
and I need to see
a doctor right away.
Oh, no, no.

03:24.805 --> 03:27.275
We already used that one.
Magnolia'll remember.

03:27.308 --> 03:29.310
Oh. Then I'll be a church choir
chaperone who got

03:29.343 --> 03:31.612
the skin on the back of her knee
caught in the zipper

03:31.645 --> 03:32.713
of a four-man tent flap.

03:32.746 --> 03:34.815
(laughs)
Oh, you are so creative.

03:34.848 --> 03:35.849
No, that really happened.

03:35.883 --> 03:37.718
Oh.

03:37.751 --> 03:40.454
Shelby, I don't want
to sneak around anymore.

03:40.488 --> 03:42.523
I want to tell
my girls about us.

03:42.556 --> 03:44.258
Oh, yay!

03:44.292 --> 03:45.459
(laughs)
Really?

03:46.727 --> 03:47.728
Are you ready?

03:47.761 --> 03:48.862
Certainly.

03:48.896 --> 03:50.698
I will tell them tomorrow night.

03:50.731 --> 03:52.600
At dinner.

03:52.633 --> 03:54.468
Someplace crowded,
and I'll have the knives

03:54.502 --> 03:57.037
taken off the table so Lemon
won't stab me in the heart.

03:57.070 --> 03:58.572
Oh, Lemon'll be fine.

03:58.606 --> 04:02.310
She is a grown woman
with her own life and concerns,

04:02.343 --> 04:04.378
not some fragile nut-job

04:04.412 --> 04:05.879
to quake in fear of.
LEMON: Daddy!

04:05.913 --> 04:07.648
Aah!
You left me sitting

04:07.681 --> 04:09.750
at the Butter Stick Bakery,
to be ogled by Cody Strong

04:09.783 --> 04:11.519
like I was the last piece
of bacon on his plate!

04:11.552 --> 04:13.621
Oh, lunch. I am so sorry.

04:13.654 --> 04:16.490
If it helps, you
could probably stand

04:16.524 --> 04:17.858
to skip lunch anyway.

04:17.891 --> 04:18.959
(gasps)

04:18.992 --> 04:20.961
We all could.

04:20.994 --> 04:24.765
Dr. Oz says it's the
least important meal.

04:24.798 --> 04:25.933
Better to have a snack.

04:27.535 --> 04:29.570
Like hummus.

04:29.603 --> 04:30.704
I'm sorry...

04:30.738 --> 04:32.640
why is she here?

04:32.673 --> 04:34.875
Oh. She is, um...

04:34.908 --> 04:36.377
The receptionist.
(laughs)

04:36.410 --> 04:37.511
(laughs)
Yes.

04:37.545 --> 04:39.613
That's right.
And...

04:39.647 --> 04:42.383
why don't you and I
go get that lunch?

04:42.416 --> 04:44.385
(chuckles)

04:44.418 --> 04:45.986
I'll just...

04:46.019 --> 04:48.422
hold down the fort.

04:48.456 --> 04:50.591
Daddy, what are you
thinking of, hiring her?

04:50.624 --> 04:52.626
You can't listen
to a nitwit like that all day.

04:52.660 --> 04:54.428
You'll go insane.
Yeah.

05:08.108 --> 05:09.543
Oh!

05:09.577 --> 05:11.845
There he is!

05:11.879 --> 05:13.947
Oh. Oh.
(chuckles)

05:15.549 --> 05:16.650
Got yourself a boat!

05:16.684 --> 05:19.687
Mom, Dad, what are you
doing here?

05:19.720 --> 05:21.655
Oh, well, we had some
business in Mobile tomorrow,

05:21.689 --> 05:23.557
so we popped by to
see how you are,

05:23.591 --> 05:25.559
and imagine our shock

05:25.593 --> 05:27.060
when Lemon answered your door.

05:27.094 --> 05:28.829
Said you were on your boat.

05:28.862 --> 05:30.564
Huh.
HAROLD:
A boat.

05:30.598 --> 05:31.532
Must mean you've arrived.
Yes.

05:31.565 --> 05:33.567
How often do you get out
on her, every weekend?

05:33.601 --> 05:34.668
Yeah.

05:34.702 --> 05:35.603
Yeah, you know--

05:35.636 --> 05:38.038
yeah, on weekends,
you know, on weekdays...

05:39.807 --> 05:41.709
I'm pretty much on it every day.

05:41.742 --> 05:44.712
Good Lord,
he lives on a boat.

05:44.745 --> 05:45.779
What happened, son?

05:45.813 --> 05:46.914
Did you lose your practice?

05:46.947 --> 05:47.981
Harold,
give him a job.

05:48.015 --> 05:49.717
No I don't-- guys,

05:49.750 --> 05:51.985
I'm fine, okay? I don't need a--
I have a job, okay?

05:52.019 --> 05:53.954
George, you're
out of-- oh.

05:53.987 --> 05:57.791
Hi.
Mom, Dad, this is Tansy.

05:57.825 --> 05:59.927
(Clora chuckles)

05:59.960 --> 06:01.862
Did she come with your boat?
GEORGE: No.

06:01.895 --> 06:04.432
Oh.
No, she has her own trailer.

06:04.465 --> 06:06.166
Your houses both move.

06:06.199 --> 06:07.401
(chuckles)
Neat.

06:07.435 --> 06:08.969
Just like circus folk.

06:09.002 --> 06:11.639
(laughs)
It's also where
I cut hair.

06:22.916 --> 06:24.552
Oh, hey.

06:24.585 --> 06:25.753
How'd it go with Lemon?

06:25.786 --> 06:27.621
Uh, good, good.

06:27.655 --> 06:29.623
Real good.

06:29.657 --> 06:30.891
Ah, she hates me,
I knew it.

06:30.924 --> 06:32.760
No... N-No, I just think

06:32.793 --> 06:34.995
she needs a chance
to warm up to you,

06:35.028 --> 06:36.864
to appreciate you like I do,

06:36.897 --> 06:38.031
before I tell her.

06:38.065 --> 06:39.967
Yes.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.034
I'll get her to love me.

06:41.068 --> 06:41.902
I'm real good at that.

06:41.935 --> 06:43.637
People almost never
love me at first,

06:43.671 --> 06:44.772
and then they just...

06:44.805 --> 06:46.640
give in.
(chuckles)

06:46.674 --> 06:48.742
(phone rings)

06:50.177 --> 06:51.645
(phone continues ringing)

06:51.679 --> 06:52.980
(clears throat)

06:57.485 --> 06:58.652
Are you kidding me?

06:58.686 --> 07:00.454
You told her you were
the receptionist.

07:01.855 --> 07:04.925
Just say my name first.

07:08.228 --> 07:12.700
Brick-- uh, Breeland and Hart
doctor office.

07:15.703 --> 07:17.671
So, Tansy, are you
pregnant, is that it?

07:17.705 --> 07:18.806
Is that what?

07:18.839 --> 07:19.940
Mom.

07:19.973 --> 07:21.174
Well, how did
you two meet?

07:21.208 --> 07:23.143
W-Was it a
dating service,

07:23.176 --> 07:24.812
you know, because
I've heard

07:24.845 --> 07:27.147
those computers can be
comically inaccurate.

07:27.180 --> 07:28.482
(laughs)
Okay, Mom.

07:28.516 --> 07:29.683
Your-your interest
in our relationship

07:29.717 --> 07:30.818
is highly appreciated,

07:30.851 --> 07:32.820
but I'm sure there's other
topics we can pursue tonight,

07:32.853 --> 07:33.987
so cut it out.
George, you can't
keep your mother

07:34.021 --> 07:35.022
from saying
what she wants.

07:35.055 --> 07:36.657
But, we found a theater

07:36.690 --> 07:38.859
in Birmingham that
serves alcohol.

07:38.892 --> 07:39.993
I've found that helps.

07:40.027 --> 07:41.629
Okay.
ZOE:
George?

07:41.662 --> 07:43.230
HAROLD:
Dr. Hart!

07:43.263 --> 07:44.898
What a nice surprise.

07:44.932 --> 07:45.899
Hi.
Hey.

07:45.933 --> 07:47.167
Mr. Tucker, Mrs. Tucker.

07:47.200 --> 07:49.537
Tansy, you're going
to see this movie?

07:49.570 --> 07:51.839
Mm-hmm. You?
Yeah.

07:51.872 --> 07:54.174
Apparently you're not a couple
unless someone's in pain.

07:54.207 --> 07:56.109
(both laugh)
ZOE: I didn't know

07:56.143 --> 07:57.811
you wanted to see this.
Heck, yeah.

07:57.845 --> 07:59.580
I've been interested
in it for weeks. I-I...

07:59.613 --> 08:00.981
It's got that guy
from The Artist...
 Artist!

08:01.014 --> 08:02.783
I know, I love that guy!
CLORA:
You know,

08:02.816 --> 08:05.553
if, um, Wade and Tansy don't
want to see this movie,

08:05.586 --> 08:08.722
we passed a theater that's
showing The Hangover 4,

08:08.756 --> 08:11.825
and I think they brought back
that delightful monkey.

08:11.859 --> 08:13.126
WADE (laughs):
Well...

08:14.728 --> 08:16.163
(clears throat)
I'm-I'm good.

08:16.196 --> 08:17.598
Yeah, no,
I-I'm good.

08:17.631 --> 08:19.700
GEORGE: Oh. Okay.
All right. Uh...

08:19.733 --> 08:20.901
Should we get tickets?

08:20.934 --> 08:22.169
Yeah.
Yeah, all right.

08:22.202 --> 08:23.971
Dad, you want to tell me
more about that theater

08:24.004 --> 08:24.972
with all the alcohol?

08:25.005 --> 08:27.174
Oh, it's wonderful,
it really is.

08:27.207 --> 08:29.209
I bet it is.

08:30.343 --> 08:32.546
*

08:35.716 --> 08:37.317
Hey, Wally?
Hmm?

08:37.350 --> 08:39.787
Who's that guy over there
with AnnaBeth?

08:39.820 --> 08:40.888
He looks familiar.

08:40.921 --> 08:41.889
Aw, some English fellow.

08:41.922 --> 08:45.092
Supposed to be here with
the oil company cleanup.

08:47.094 --> 08:48.962
I think I met him
somewhere before.

08:48.996 --> 08:50.230
Well, first time
in BlueBell,

08:50.263 --> 08:53.834
but I hear he's lived
all over-- Rome, Paris.

08:53.867 --> 08:55.836
Maybe he played football.
Oh, don't you
start that, too.

08:55.869 --> 08:57.237
Now, it's called soccer,

08:57.270 --> 09:00.774
and I still say it's not
gonna catch on here.

09:00.808 --> 09:02.209
(AnnaBeth laughs)

09:02.242 --> 09:05.345
OLIVER: Did I tell you already
how beautiful you're looking?

09:05.378 --> 09:06.580
You did.
Oh.

09:06.614 --> 09:07.781
(laughs)
You look fantastic.

09:07.815 --> 09:09.549
ANNABETH:
Thank you.

09:11.384 --> 09:13.687
I was about to die in there.

09:13.721 --> 09:14.822
Yeah, it would have better

09:14.855 --> 09:16.323
with a monkey in it.

09:16.356 --> 09:18.091
Couldn't hear my snoring,
could you?

09:18.125 --> 09:20.093
Nah, I'm a pretty heavy
sleeper myself.

09:20.127 --> 09:22.029
(both laugh)

09:22.062 --> 09:23.163
No, I thought it was brilliant.

09:23.196 --> 09:25.165
I just, I-- you know,
I read somewhere

09:25.198 --> 09:27.768
that half the audience walked
out when it premiered at Cannes.

09:27.801 --> 09:30.303
Oh, my God, I would love to walk
out of this movie in Cannes.

09:30.337 --> 09:31.872
Yeah, I would too.
(laughs)

09:31.905 --> 09:34.341
Uh, but the best part
was that girl, um, from that...

09:34.374 --> 09:35.809
Oh, my God, from
that other movie!

09:35.843 --> 09:37.144
Yes! It was the best
she's ever...

09:37.177 --> 09:38.679
You see that?
Mm-hmm.

09:38.712 --> 09:40.781
That is who George
should be with.

09:40.814 --> 09:43.851
Just look at them.

09:43.884 --> 09:45.018
Clora, let George be.

09:45.052 --> 09:46.119
I'd like to visit him

09:46.153 --> 09:47.788
one time without
involving ourselves

09:47.821 --> 09:49.723
in some grand
Jacobean drama.

09:49.757 --> 09:52.826
No, the reason I couldn't
stand Lemon Breeland

09:52.860 --> 09:55.195
was because she was gonna keep
him in that backwater town

09:55.228 --> 09:57.130
for the rest of his life.

09:57.164 --> 09:59.833
And that Tansy, ugh,
she's even worse.

09:59.867 --> 10:02.703
But he likes Tansy,
and frankly, so do I.

10:02.736 --> 10:03.771
Oh, I know you do.

10:03.804 --> 10:07.074
Especially when she's
wearing nothing but a towel.

10:07.107 --> 10:08.241
But Dr. Hart?

10:08.275 --> 10:10.844
You know, she can get
him out of BlueBell,

10:10.878 --> 10:12.980
and back to the life
he's meant for.

10:13.013 --> 10:14.314
As is God's plan.

10:14.347 --> 10:17.017
You may be mixing up
you and God again.

10:17.050 --> 10:21.054
As long as we get results,
I'm happy to share the credit.

10:22.222 --> 10:23.857
(chuckles)
No.

10:23.891 --> 10:25.125
That-that's the one.
Really?

10:25.158 --> 10:26.960
That-- yes, that is.

10:26.994 --> 10:29.329
(car horn honks)

10:29.362 --> 10:31.431
(seagulls calling)

10:31.464 --> 10:33.767
(birds singing)

10:41.474 --> 10:42.843
WADE:
 You said what?

10:42.876 --> 10:43.844
That we would go to dinner

10:43.877 --> 10:45.045
with George and Tansy tonight.

10:45.078 --> 10:46.980
W... How drunk were you?

10:47.014 --> 10:49.016
I wasn't.
You were at the bar with Tansy

10:49.049 --> 10:50.851
trying to throw
popcorn into the brim

10:50.884 --> 10:52.085
of that passed-out
farmer's hat,

10:52.119 --> 10:54.688
when George said, you know,
everyone's having a good time,

10:54.722 --> 10:56.156
we should do it again
tomorrow night.

10:56.189 --> 10:57.791
Without his parents.
Yeah,

10:57.825 --> 11:00.360
and without us.
Why not? It's okay

11:00.393 --> 11:02.095
to go out with other couples.
You know,

11:02.129 --> 11:04.097
that's why a lot of tables
come with four chairs.

11:04.131 --> 11:06.033
Look, Zoe, if I wanted
to date Tansy,

11:06.066 --> 11:07.234
I'd still be married to her,

11:07.267 --> 11:09.402
and if I wanted to date George
Tucker, I could date you,

11:09.436 --> 11:10.403
which, oops, I already am.

11:10.437 --> 11:12.005
LAVON:
Wade.

11:12.039 --> 11:13.707
You got any old yearbooks?

11:13.741 --> 11:17.077
Me? Oh, yeah, I use 'em
to press my prom flowers, Lavon.

11:17.110 --> 11:20.047
I know I've seen that English
guy that AnnaBeth is sweet on.

11:20.080 --> 11:22.449
Somewhere in these boxes,
I'm gonna find out where.

11:22.482 --> 11:24.084
So you don't want
to double-date. Okay, I'm sorry

11:24.117 --> 11:25.452
for wanting to improve
our lives.

11:25.485 --> 11:27.054
But it's already
too late to cancel.

11:27.087 --> 11:28.288
What would I even say?

11:28.321 --> 11:29.890
Say no, that's what.

11:29.923 --> 11:32.359
Tansy, it's
one night out.

11:32.392 --> 11:34.327
With my ex-husband and Zoe Hart,

11:34.361 --> 11:36.797
who I just don't find
that much fun, and...

11:36.830 --> 11:39.199
when you're with her, I'm sorry,
but neither are you.

11:39.232 --> 11:42.402
Yes, I am. I'm fun.

11:42.435 --> 11:45.238
(chuckles) I already went out
with your parents,

11:45.272 --> 11:49.376
and it's as much forced smiling
as my face can take for now.

11:49.409 --> 11:50.844
Okay, fine. I understand.
I understand.

11:50.878 --> 11:52.312
I'll just tell Zoe you said no.

11:52.345 --> 11:54.181
Oh, no, you will not!

11:54.214 --> 11:56.917
Oh, no, you will not tell Tucker
I don't want to go.

11:56.950 --> 11:58.485
But you don't.
Yeah, but he'll think

11:58.518 --> 11:59.419
I'm jealous or whatever, okay?

11:59.452 --> 12:01.521
It's a very delicate situation,
so just...

12:01.554 --> 12:03.090
you know, make something up.

12:03.123 --> 12:04.191
(sighs)
LAVON:
Ah.

12:04.224 --> 12:06.794
Found it. Got you.

12:06.827 --> 12:08.495
Found what?

12:08.528 --> 12:10.397
I don't know.
Sometimes it's like

12:10.430 --> 12:12.365
he's in his own little world.

12:12.399 --> 12:14.434
(birds chirping)

12:14.467 --> 12:16.503
Magnolia, what is it?
I got your text.

12:16.536 --> 12:17.905
What's the emergency?

12:17.938 --> 12:19.807
This.

12:21.508 --> 12:23.376
No.

12:23.410 --> 12:24.644
And I am glad
that you called me

12:24.677 --> 12:27.247
because that is not appropriate
for you and over my dead body

12:27.280 --> 12:28.248
will you be
wearing that.

12:28.281 --> 12:30.383
Lemon, I found it in the couch.

12:30.417 --> 12:32.452
Do you even know
what this means?

12:33.520 --> 12:36.423
Oh, my God,
Daddy's seeing someone.

12:36.456 --> 12:38.525
(sighs)
Oh, good. I thought...

12:38.558 --> 12:40.460
I thought it was his.

12:41.962 --> 12:43.931
(scoffs)

12:43.964 --> 12:45.498
(footsteps approach)

12:45.532 --> 12:46.366
Morning.

12:46.399 --> 12:48.068
Oh, hi!

12:48.101 --> 12:50.103
Hey, uh, listen,
a-about tonight...

12:50.137 --> 12:51.905
Yeah, I was just
about to call you.

12:51.939 --> 12:53.206
I forgot I have
this thing.
Something came up.

12:53.240 --> 12:55.575
On TV.
A phone call.

12:55.608 --> 12:57.077
It's this movie.
My mom's supposed to call.

12:57.110 --> 12:59.913
It's called Kangaroo
 Jack and...
She's been drinking a lot...

12:59.947 --> 13:01.982
(both speaking rapidly,
at once)

13:02.015 --> 13:04.151
...so, some other
night, though!
Absolutely!

13:05.185 --> 13:06.854
Good luck with your mom!
Enjoy your movie!

13:10.023 --> 13:12.425
ANNABETH: ...and he is
 so handsome.

13:12.459 --> 13:13.493
And that accent--

13:13.526 --> 13:15.562
I could hear him read
the label off a soup can.

13:15.595 --> 13:18.298
(giggles) Oh...
And his name could not

13:18.331 --> 13:19.466
be any more British.

13:19.499 --> 13:20.500
(British accent):
Oliver.

13:21.601 --> 13:23.003
Lemon?

13:23.036 --> 13:24.537
A lover.

13:24.571 --> 13:26.439
I know.
No.

13:26.473 --> 13:28.041
Ol-i-ver.

13:28.075 --> 13:29.376
A lover.

13:29.409 --> 13:30.911
My father has a lover.

13:30.944 --> 13:33.313
AnnaBeth, do you not hear
a word that I say?

13:33.346 --> 13:35.949
Yes. And I told you
I think it's great.

13:35.983 --> 13:37.918
And that I'm sure
there's a reason

13:37.951 --> 13:40.187
he doesn't want you to know.
AnnaBeth, I have

13:40.220 --> 13:41.321
an obligation to know.

13:41.354 --> 13:42.589
After Emily, he's vulnerable,

13:42.622 --> 13:45.458
and he could fall prey to any
number of gold-digging trollops.

13:45.492 --> 13:46.459
Lemon!

13:47.460 --> 13:48.929
Sorry to interrupt.

13:48.962 --> 13:50.597
I accidentally ordered
an extra puff pastry,

13:50.630 --> 13:52.365
and I wanted you to have it.

13:52.399 --> 13:54.968
Mm.
This is Shelby,

13:55.002 --> 13:57.004
my daddy's
receptionist.

13:57.037 --> 13:58.605
For now.
Hi, yes.

13:58.638 --> 13:59.940
And seeing as how

13:59.973 --> 14:01.208
we're both
in your father's life,

14:01.241 --> 14:03.576
in certain ways--
very different ways--

14:03.610 --> 14:05.946
I was thinking that maybe
that we could

14:05.979 --> 14:07.948
get to know each other
over dinner tonight.

14:07.981 --> 14:09.616
(chuckles)
Oh.

14:09.649 --> 14:12.852
Well, I don't see
how that could...

14:15.255 --> 14:18.091
...how that could hurt at all.

14:18.125 --> 14:19.559
In fact, I
think it's

14:19.592 --> 14:20.493
a wonderful idea!

14:20.527 --> 14:21.962
(chuckles)
Uh-oh.

14:21.995 --> 14:23.630
It is?
Run.

14:23.663 --> 14:25.598
My father has always

14:25.632 --> 14:28.168
treated his employees
like members of the family.

14:28.201 --> 14:30.971
Well, I guess that makes us
like sisters then.

14:31.004 --> 14:32.973
Exactly! So how 'bout us sisters

14:33.006 --> 14:36.043
find out what bimbo my daddy
is sleeping with, hmm?

14:39.146 --> 14:40.447
Told you.

14:42.715 --> 14:44.351
Howdy.

14:44.384 --> 14:45.618
How you doing?

14:45.652 --> 14:47.087
Mayor Lavon Hayes.

14:47.120 --> 14:47.988
Oh, I'm Oliver Kent.

14:48.021 --> 14:49.589
Pleasure to meet you.
Actually, I think

14:49.622 --> 14:50.557
we've already met.

14:50.590 --> 14:52.325
Have we indeed?

14:52.359 --> 14:54.461
Yes, by Jove, we have.

14:54.494 --> 14:56.263
Indeed.

14:56.296 --> 14:59.266
At a bachelor weekend in
Louisiana a few years ago.

14:59.299 --> 15:01.568
Yeah. You were our
Southern-born,

15:01.601 --> 15:06.439
backwoods-bred, tobacco-chewin',
catfish-guttin' river guide.

15:07.440 --> 15:08.408
(chuckles)

15:08.441 --> 15:10.910
Indeed I was.

15:13.180 --> 15:15.315
Righto. Well, well done.

15:15.348 --> 15:18.251
Yeah, well... so you can
drop the fake accent,

15:18.285 --> 15:20.687
tell me what you're
trying to pull here.

15:25.592 --> 15:29.529
I'm not trying to pull anything,
I'm afraid.

15:29.562 --> 15:32.665
The accent
is all too real and...

15:32.699 --> 15:35.969
sadly, it's...
beyond my control.

15:38.171 --> 15:40.173
WADE:
I just don't understand
why we had to come

15:40.207 --> 15:41.308
all the way out here.

15:41.341 --> 15:43.076
I mean, the prices
are all jacked up.

15:43.110 --> 15:45.178
I could mix better drinks
than these from the backwash

15:45.212 --> 15:47.180
from these glasses. No offense.

15:47.214 --> 15:49.249
Because I didn't want us
to run into George

15:49.282 --> 15:51.284
and Tansy in town after
that lie you made me tell.

15:51.318 --> 15:53.987
Oh, I didn't make up the lie,
all right? It was...

15:57.057 --> 16:00.593
My mom was too drunk to talk!
 Kangaroo Jack was way
too scary for Tansy.

16:00.627 --> 16:03.596
Uh, well,
you can stop now.
Okay!

16:04.597 --> 16:05.598
(chuckles)

16:12.772 --> 16:13.406
Okay, well,
first of all, oops.

16:13.440 --> 16:15.475
Am I right?
Uh, you know,

16:15.508 --> 16:17.310
we can go
somewhere else...

16:17.344 --> 16:18.778
No, guys, guys, come on.
Don't-don't be silly.

16:18.811 --> 16:21.348
All right? W-We're all here,
you got me? We might as well

16:21.381 --> 16:23.550
just, you know, sit...
We're in a fight!

16:23.583 --> 16:25.252
We are in a... fight.

16:25.285 --> 16:27.754
GEORGE: Things got ugly.
Things were

16:27.787 --> 16:29.456
said on both sides.
Both sides?

16:29.489 --> 16:32.225
Oh, my God, George Tucker,
can't you for once just say

16:32.259 --> 16:34.027
you're sorry?!

16:35.062 --> 16:36.796
I guess we'll take
this table.

16:36.829 --> 16:38.098
We're good here.

16:38.131 --> 16:39.166
WADE:
So, yeah...

16:39.199 --> 16:41.434
ZOE:
Mm-hmm.
Yeah...

16:44.337 --> 16:46.439
(quietly):
You're... really good at that.

16:46.473 --> 16:47.607
Thank you.

16:47.640 --> 16:49.042
It's a little scary.

16:49.076 --> 16:50.677
Can be.

16:55.548 --> 16:57.384
*

16:59.452 --> 17:02.822
"Foreign Accent Syndrome"?

17:02.855 --> 17:04.557
No, man, that's not a thing.

17:04.590 --> 17:07.394
It's hard to believe, I know,
but you can look it up.

17:07.426 --> 17:08.560
Oh, I will.

17:08.595 --> 17:10.163
Oh, if-if you go online, um,

17:10.196 --> 17:11.330
find the guy in Wisconsin

17:11.364 --> 17:12.665
who woke up out of a coma
and started

17:12.699 --> 17:14.233
talking like Arnold
Schwarzenegger.

17:14.267 --> 17:15.402
It's-it's hilarious.

17:15.435 --> 17:16.403
Wait, were you in a coma?

17:16.435 --> 17:17.404
No, no, I just...

17:17.436 --> 17:18.238
hit my head on my boat,

17:18.271 --> 17:20.107
started having
terrible migraines,

17:20.140 --> 17:21.108
and then...

17:21.141 --> 17:23.276
one day,
this was how I spoke.

17:23.310 --> 17:26.378
Huh.
"Foreign Accent Syndrome."

17:26.413 --> 17:28.115
It's rare, but it's
well-documented.

17:28.147 --> 17:29.682
It's even treatable
with migraine drugs.

17:29.716 --> 17:32.119
So why didn't the drugs work?

17:32.152 --> 17:33.720
(sighs)

17:33.753 --> 17:35.555
I didn't take them.

17:35.588 --> 17:37.257
Why not?

17:38.291 --> 17:39.826
With this accent,

17:39.859 --> 17:42.362
my life improved immediately.

17:42.395 --> 17:45.565
People who met me for the first
time, they suddenly found me...

17:45.598 --> 17:47.267
sophisticated, witty,

17:47.300 --> 17:49.302
educated.

17:50.303 --> 17:51.638
And, uh, well, the ladies...

17:51.671 --> 17:54.174
the, uh, ladies do love
a good accent, don't they?

17:54.207 --> 17:55.775
(chuckles)
Yeah.

17:55.808 --> 17:57.777
But you're lying to people.

17:57.810 --> 17:59.312
No. No, I'm not.

17:59.346 --> 18:01.481
I-I say I'm from Birmingham,
people just...

18:01.514 --> 18:03.850
assume England, not Alabama.

18:03.883 --> 18:05.885
I say I've lived
in... Paris

18:05.918 --> 18:08.721
and Rome, and... they just
happen to be in...

18:08.755 --> 18:10.823
Texas and Georgia.

18:10.857 --> 18:13.460
And the oil company
cleanup job?

18:13.493 --> 18:15.295
Scrubbing the wings of pelicans.

18:16.329 --> 18:18.298
Man.

18:18.331 --> 18:20.200
I mean, it all seems so hard.

18:20.233 --> 18:22.235
No, not really.
I mean, it smells a bit,

18:22.269 --> 18:23.703
and they bite.
Not the pelicans, man.

18:23.736 --> 18:24.737
The secret.

18:24.771 --> 18:26.473
Oh, right. Yeah.

18:26.506 --> 18:27.840
And it's not fair
to other people.

18:27.874 --> 18:29.842
I-I'm the mayor

18:29.876 --> 18:32.245
of this town, and I'm...
I-I worry about people here

18:32.279 --> 18:35.248
getting attached to you,
you know, under false pretenses.

18:35.282 --> 18:36.749
Getting hurt.

18:42.855 --> 18:45.825
Is there someone here
you might get attached to?

18:45.858 --> 18:48.395
Possibly.

18:49.896 --> 18:52.832
Then I'm gonna have to ask you
to tell that person the truth.

18:58.571 --> 18:59.672
Oh, hey!

18:59.706 --> 19:01.408
How did it go with Lemon?

19:01.441 --> 19:04.444
Mm! Well, the good news
is she loves me.

19:04.477 --> 19:07.447
The bad news is she hates
the bimbo you're sleeping with.
Oh, my.

19:07.480 --> 19:09.516
And she wants me to help her
find out who it is.

19:09.549 --> 19:12.185
We're having dinner
in a half an hour to talk.
Oh, no, no, no.

19:12.219 --> 19:14.454
Cancel that. Cancel that.

19:14.487 --> 19:17.924
Tomorrow, I will... I will
just tell both girls,

19:17.957 --> 19:19.926
but until then, you lay low.

19:19.959 --> 19:21.961
Avoid Lemon. Uh...

19:21.994 --> 19:24.397
tell her... tell her
y-you're working late tonight.

19:24.431 --> 19:25.798
Good idea.

19:25.832 --> 19:28.501
Then you still want to meet
later at the Candlewood?

19:28.535 --> 19:30.803
Well, actually,
I was really hoping that

19:30.837 --> 19:32.405
you would work late.

19:32.439 --> 19:35.242
'Cause we haven't had
a receptionist, and there's

19:35.275 --> 19:36.409
a ton to catch up on.

19:36.443 --> 19:37.310
(weak laugh)

19:37.344 --> 19:38.511
Call me?

19:40.580 --> 19:41.914
Sitting ten feet away
from them

19:41.948 --> 19:43.516
and pretending
that they don't exist,

19:43.550 --> 19:45.685
that's less awkward than
just going out with them?

19:45.718 --> 19:48.788
By far, yeah.
No, don't you see?
We both lie,

19:48.821 --> 19:51.458
and we both pick the same place
to cover our lies.

19:51.491 --> 19:53.826
We're very compatible.
TANSY: I mean it,
George Tucker,

19:53.860 --> 19:55.962
don't you tell me
what to do!

19:55.995 --> 19:58.298
GEORGE (quietly):
I think we can

19:58.331 --> 19:59.532
make up now.

19:59.566 --> 20:00.967
Sorry. When I pick a road,

20:01.000 --> 20:02.435
I commit.
(phone chimes)

20:02.469 --> 20:04.737
I can tell.
Sorry, it's my...

20:04.771 --> 20:06.306
it's my mom.

20:06.339 --> 20:08.441
(phone rings)
GEORGE: "Looking for

20:08.475 --> 20:09.376
"Dr. Hart. Not to worry,

20:09.409 --> 20:11.444
"your father just having
tiny chest pains.

20:11.478 --> 20:12.979
On your boat if you find her."

20:13.012 --> 20:14.981
George?
Is that my mom?

20:15.014 --> 20:16.616
Yeah. I-I mean,
I'm sure it's nothing,

20:16.649 --> 20:18.318
but I should check it out.
GEORGE: Yeah,

20:18.351 --> 20:20.520
no, I-I'm going, too.
I-I'll go with you.

20:20.553 --> 20:22.655
Baby, I-I don't know
if this is the right situation.

20:22.689 --> 20:24.824
My mom's gonna be...
really tense.
And...

20:24.857 --> 20:27.694
now's not the time,
you're right.

20:27.727 --> 20:30.330
I'm sorry. But I-I will
be right back, I promise. Okay?

20:30.363 --> 20:31.898
Okay.
All right.

20:37.304 --> 20:39.306
(sighs)

20:43.310 --> 20:44.944
You, uh...

20:44.977 --> 20:46.713
think he's gonna finish that?

20:54.354 --> 20:55.488
Oh, you poor thing!

20:55.522 --> 20:56.823
Lemon!

20:56.856 --> 20:58.391
Hi. Uh...

20:58.425 --> 20:59.692
did you get my message? I...

20:59.726 --> 21:01.628
I'm just, uh, too busy here
to go to dinner.

21:01.661 --> 21:02.995
I know. Daddy is
such a slave driver,

21:03.029 --> 21:05.632
so I brought our dinner here!

21:05.665 --> 21:08.768
You did not have to do that.

21:08.801 --> 21:10.503
Oh, nonsense.

21:10.537 --> 21:12.639
And I can stay all night,
if I have to.

21:12.672 --> 21:14.374
I'm not leaving here
till I found what I came for.

21:14.407 --> 21:15.508
Let's start

21:15.542 --> 21:17.544
with his calendar,
shall we?

21:19.812 --> 21:20.880
(panting)

21:20.913 --> 21:23.316
Mom, hey.

21:23.350 --> 21:24.484
Where's Dad?
How's he feeling?

21:24.517 --> 21:25.985
Oh, George, I'm sure he's fine.

21:26.018 --> 21:28.621
He's just laying down
on your bed

21:28.655 --> 21:30.357
for a little bit.

21:32.892 --> 21:35.862
We just stopped over to bring
you your boat-warming present.

21:35.895 --> 21:38.498
It's a weather station,
and, um,

21:38.531 --> 21:41.734
you know, he just started
feeling a little faint is all.

21:41.768 --> 21:43.035
Mom, where is he?

21:43.069 --> 21:44.637
(engine whirring)

21:44.671 --> 21:46.072
Are we moving?

21:51.478 --> 21:52.945
Mom, did you trick us
into coming?

21:52.979 --> 21:54.881
You two belong together!

21:54.914 --> 21:56.816
I can see it with my own eyes,

21:56.849 --> 21:58.951
and until you admit it,
or give me a damn good

21:58.985 --> 22:03.556
reason why not, no one is
getting off this boat!

22:03.590 --> 22:05.692
GEORGE:
Mom, you're gonna flood it.

22:05.725 --> 22:07.394
(engine sputtering)

22:11.130 --> 22:13.032
Maybe even then.

22:24.444 --> 22:27.647
Well, it is completely flooded.

22:27.680 --> 22:28.915
Which is great, 'cause we get

22:28.948 --> 22:30.983
to sit here
and wait for it to dry out

22:31.017 --> 22:32.919
while we float on out to sea.

22:32.952 --> 22:35.087
More time to chat.

22:35.121 --> 22:37.123
Mom, there is nothing
to chat about, okay?

22:37.156 --> 22:40.393
Who we choose to be with is
none of your business.

22:40.427 --> 22:42.529
When you have children, their
happiness is your only business.

22:42.562 --> 22:44.130
Well, I'm perfectly happy.

22:44.163 --> 22:46.566
Then just tell me why
you two aren't together.

22:46.599 --> 22:47.967
As your mother,
I deserve

22:48.000 --> 22:49.536
that much,
and then I will never

22:49.569 --> 22:51.170
speak of it again.

22:51.203 --> 22:53.406
Okay. Fine.

22:56.443 --> 22:58.945
Zoe, you've made a number
of speeches on the subject.

22:58.978 --> 23:00.847
Maybe you can summarize.

23:02.815 --> 23:05.885
Oh. Okay.

23:05.918 --> 23:07.587
When George
was marrying Lemon,

23:07.620 --> 23:09.856
I definitely wanted to be
with him, but couldn't,

23:09.889 --> 23:11.624
so, on his
wedding day,

23:11.658 --> 23:13.460
I accidently had sex with Wade,

23:13.493 --> 23:14.994
but then George
was available, but

23:15.027 --> 23:16.996
I didn't want to be his rebound.
I mean, 15 years, right?

23:17.029 --> 23:19.165
So I told him to
date other women

23:19.198 --> 23:21.167
while I got close
with Wade, totally casually.

23:21.200 --> 23:23.002
Even though I still
wanted to be with George

23:23.035 --> 23:25.171
someday, I knew that he was
waiting around for me,

23:25.204 --> 23:26.873
so I told him
to date someone seriously

23:26.906 --> 23:28.508
so he could break up with them.

23:28.541 --> 23:29.909
But then Wade
realized that

23:29.942 --> 23:31.210
I was just waiting for George,

23:31.243 --> 23:33.746
so I decided to give it
a real shot with Wade.

23:33.780 --> 23:35.548
I even went
to a Taylor Swift concert

23:35.582 --> 23:37.183
so I could get
his basket of crackers.

23:37.216 --> 23:39.719
Oh, and then George wound up
hooking up with Wade's ex-wife.

23:39.752 --> 23:41.521
I'm sorry.
What was the question?

23:41.554 --> 23:44.724
Made more sense at the time.

23:48.094 --> 23:50.597
Foreign Accent Syndrome.

23:50.630 --> 23:53.600
Right. So, not British.

23:53.633 --> 23:55.101
Not a subject of the crown,

23:55.134 --> 23:57.504
as they say.
A right Colonial, I am...

23:57.537 --> 23:59.639
Yeah, okay. Stop.

23:59.672 --> 24:02.108
You still have migraines?

24:02.141 --> 24:04.110
Oh, yes.
They're awful, sometimes.

24:04.143 --> 24:05.645
Then that's crazy!

24:05.678 --> 24:08.214
You need to see a doctor
and get the medicine.

24:08.247 --> 24:10.249
Yeah, I wish
it were that simple.

24:10.282 --> 24:12.251
Are you embarrassed
what people might think?

24:12.284 --> 24:15.555
Because I've been going to
Dr. Breeland since I was a baby.

24:15.588 --> 24:17.089
I know he'll keep this quiet.

24:17.123 --> 24:20.560
And if the accent goes away?

24:20.593 --> 24:23.996
What, you think
people won't like you anymore?

24:25.598 --> 24:27.567
I will.

24:27.600 --> 24:31.671
Anyone who likes you now
will like you as a colonial.

24:31.704 --> 24:33.039
(laughs)

24:33.072 --> 24:35.942
I think you might be
underestimating its power.

24:35.975 --> 24:38.578
And you're underestimating you.

24:38.611 --> 24:40.813
The accent didn't change you.

24:40.847 --> 24:42.549
It just gave you the confidence

24:42.582 --> 24:44.684
to be the person
you already were.

24:46.252 --> 24:47.954
But your name is Oliver, right?

24:47.987 --> 24:49.255
Because that's a deal breaker.

24:49.288 --> 24:51.057
(laughs)
Yeah.

24:51.090 --> 24:52.559
(laughs)

24:52.592 --> 24:54.561
Very interesting,
don't you think?

24:54.594 --> 24:56.796
Look, I think you're getting
worked up, all right?

24:56.829 --> 24:59.231
I didn't want this double date,
you didn't want it.

24:59.265 --> 25:01.000
(phone ringing)
And now, they're off together.

25:01.033 --> 25:03.135
And you and I are sitting here.
Hmm?

25:03.169 --> 25:05.738
Okay, okay,
here's the doc now.

25:05.772 --> 25:07.640
"Sorry.
Hope to be back soon.

25:07.674 --> 25:09.809
George's mom kidnapped us
on his boat."

25:09.842 --> 25:12.044
See? An explanation.

25:12.078 --> 25:14.246
Yeah, the explanation is
that I'm not good enough

25:14.280 --> 25:17.016
for her little boy,
and she wants him with Zoe Hart!

25:17.049 --> 25:18.585
Well, we'll see about that!

25:18.618 --> 25:20.620
Whoa, whoa, Tansy,
sit down, okay?

25:20.653 --> 25:22.154
This is my life
we're talking about!

25:22.188 --> 25:23.890
When does my voice get heard?

25:23.923 --> 25:26.759
Oh, your voice is getting heard
by plenty of people right now.

25:26.793 --> 25:28.695
Look, I'm telling you
from experience, all right?

25:28.728 --> 25:30.897
You can't freak out
at every twist and turn

25:30.930 --> 25:32.865
of the Zoe Hart-George Tucker
fun house ride.

25:32.899 --> 25:35.167
Just like I know
she's with me, not him...

25:35.201 --> 25:36.903
you got to have a little trust.

25:36.936 --> 25:38.337
Well, I don't trust so well.

25:38.370 --> 25:41.140
And thank you, by the way,
for your contribution to that.

25:41.173 --> 25:43.109
But I am gonna go
and fight for what I want,

25:43.142 --> 25:44.777
and if you just want to sit here

25:44.811 --> 25:46.979
and have life happen to you,
well, do what you want.

25:47.013 --> 25:49.315
(sighs)

25:50.349 --> 25:53.152
Nope, I need a ride. Come on.

25:53.185 --> 25:54.987
Well, I...

25:55.021 --> 25:56.555
Come on!

25:57.924 --> 25:59.592
We can't give up.

25:59.626 --> 26:01.327
We have to find out
who he's seeing.

26:01.360 --> 26:04.196
Last thing Daddy needs
is some trashy strumpet

26:04.230 --> 26:06.833
using his fragile heart
as a way to his money.

26:06.866 --> 26:10.637
Now, what makes you think
that this person is trashy?

26:10.670 --> 26:13.640
Well, this cheap hooker bra

26:13.673 --> 26:15.975
she left at my house
for starters.

26:16.008 --> 26:18.044
Oh...! Oh, I don't know.

26:18.077 --> 26:20.246
I bet whoever it is has taste,

26:20.279 --> 26:23.349
and wants it back
'cause it's so expensive.

26:23.382 --> 26:25.351
I should use it like
Cinderella's glass slipper.

26:25.384 --> 26:27.353
Going around town
seeing who it fits.

26:27.386 --> 26:28.688
(laughter)

26:28.721 --> 26:29.856
Oh, God!

26:32.124 --> 26:36.362
Maybe you're selling
your father short.

26:36.395 --> 26:37.964
How do you mean?

26:37.997 --> 26:40.667
Well, this woman
may be great for him.

26:40.700 --> 26:43.135
She may be young
and full of life.

26:43.169 --> 26:44.403
Delightful, even.

26:44.436 --> 26:47.206
Like, someone you would never
imagine in your wildest dreams.

26:47.239 --> 26:49.075
(phone ringing)

26:49.108 --> 26:52.011
Someone calling here
this late?

26:52.044 --> 26:54.013
Doctors' office.

26:54.046 --> 26:56.415
Uh, n-no, he's not.
Can I take...?

26:56.448 --> 26:59.285
Well, at home,
I would imagine.

26:59.318 --> 27:00.953
I can call.

27:00.987 --> 27:02.989
Oh, you-you got
his number. Good.

27:03.022 --> 27:04.256
Well, if you can't

27:04.290 --> 27:06.392
reach him,
who can I say was calling?

27:06.425 --> 27:09.662
AnnaBeth... Nass.

27:09.696 --> 27:12.064
Thank you.

27:13.365 --> 27:15.267
AnnaBeth's calling my dad
at night?

27:15.301 --> 27:17.670
Uh, she said
it was a personal matter.

27:17.704 --> 27:21.340
Shelby, AnnaBeth is young,
she's unattached,

27:21.373 --> 27:23.109
and she discouraged me

27:23.142 --> 27:24.811
from finding
the gold-digging trollop,

27:24.844 --> 27:27.346
because the gold-digging trollop
is her!

27:28.414 --> 27:30.116
My best friend!

27:32.018 --> 27:33.986
So, anything else

27:34.020 --> 27:36.789
would seem like a relief, right?

27:36.823 --> 27:39.391
GEORGE:
 Maybe I can try

27:39.425 --> 27:42.294
and call Raleigh at the marina,
see if he can send someone.

27:42.328 --> 27:44.163
You're ignoring the issue.
Because the only one here

27:44.196 --> 27:45.765
with an issue, Mom, is you.

27:45.798 --> 27:46.899
Oh, please.

27:46.933 --> 27:49.969
You both already admit
that you're drawn to each other.

27:50.002 --> 27:51.904
No, I said
that we had been in the past.

27:51.938 --> 27:53.039
(quietly):
Okay, watch it, don't engage.

27:53.072 --> 27:55.708
She married a lawyer,
raised two others. She's crafty.

27:55.742 --> 27:57.276
MRS. TUCKER:
Okay, fine, you were

27:57.309 --> 27:59.311
drawn to each other.

27:59.345 --> 28:01.714
In fact, isn't it true

28:01.748 --> 28:05.918
that George left his fiancée
at the altar for you?

28:05.952 --> 28:07.219
Objection.

28:07.253 --> 28:09.088
Leading the witness.
And if George

28:09.121 --> 28:11.323
had called off his wedding
one day sooner,

28:11.357 --> 28:12.925
you never would have
been with Wade.

28:12.959 --> 28:14.193
You'd have been with George.

28:14.226 --> 28:16.062
Objection.
Calls for speculation.

28:16.095 --> 28:18.731
I told you
that the timing was bad.

28:18.765 --> 28:20.299
I'm just trying to understand.

28:20.332 --> 28:22.468
Now, you two wanted
to be together,

28:22.501 --> 28:25.171
and there's nothing that's
keeping you from being together.

28:25.204 --> 28:27.406
Well, just, you know, fate.

28:27.439 --> 28:29.341
MRS. TUCKER:
Fate, timing.

28:29.375 --> 28:31.477
Dr. Hart,
you're a person of science,

28:31.510 --> 28:35.447
yet you've handed over your life
to mystical forces.

28:35.481 --> 28:36.415
Objection!

28:37.316 --> 28:38.317
Have not.

28:38.350 --> 28:40.319
So you do have free will!

28:40.352 --> 28:44.023
Yes, okay, I could have chosen
George at any point.

28:44.056 --> 28:46.458
Except you no longer
have feelings for him.
Huh?

28:46.492 --> 28:47.894
Well, no, I didn't say that.

28:47.927 --> 28:49.095
Well, then, it must be
that George no longer

28:49.128 --> 28:50.296
has feelings for you.

28:50.329 --> 28:51.530
Objection!

28:51.563 --> 28:54.500
On what grounds?
On the grounds
that cut it the hell out, Mom.

28:54.533 --> 28:57.436
Because you know you still do
have feelings, and so does she,

28:57.469 --> 28:59.839
and I will cut it
out if the two of you

28:59.872 --> 29:01.507
will just admit it.

29:01.540 --> 29:04.243
Okay, fine!
We have feelings for each other!

29:04.276 --> 29:05.544
Are you happy?

29:05.577 --> 29:07.013
I'm not.

29:08.147 --> 29:10.116
How about you, Wade?
You happy?

29:10.149 --> 29:12.151
(clears throat)
Well, I've been better.

29:21.828 --> 29:23.062
Tansy, how-how
did you...?

29:23.095 --> 29:25.464
How what? How did I know
I needed to see

29:25.497 --> 29:27.499
what was going on here?
No. How...?

29:27.533 --> 29:29.201
How did you get
to the boat?

29:29.235 --> 29:31.337
LeRoy Calley keeps
that canoe tied up, so...

29:31.370 --> 29:32.872
Mm.
See, I knew

29:32.905 --> 29:34.073
she was up
to no good.

29:34.106 --> 29:35.207
No, listen.

29:35.241 --> 29:36.375
She was just trying

29:36.408 --> 29:38.878
to show us we
should be together.

29:38.911 --> 29:40.079
She lawyered us!

29:40.112 --> 29:41.047
Okay, I got confused.

29:41.080 --> 29:42.982
I mean, never call me
for a witness, boy.

29:43.015 --> 29:44.116
I would not hold up.

29:44.150 --> 29:45.417
That's true.

29:45.451 --> 29:48.287
Mrs. Tucker,
George is with me.

29:48.320 --> 29:49.521
Got it?

29:49.555 --> 29:51.457
Exactly what I've
been telling her, baby.

29:51.490 --> 29:53.860
I want us to break up.
What?!

29:53.893 --> 29:54.693
ZOE: Tansy, wait, wait.
Okay, yeah,

29:54.726 --> 29:56.362
so, George and I
had a relationship.

29:56.395 --> 29:58.230
Wait-- no, no-- never,
never a relationship.

29:58.264 --> 30:01.000
But feelings, yes.
Does that mean

30:01.033 --> 30:02.268
we should be together? No.

30:02.301 --> 30:03.302
You and Wade were married.

30:03.335 --> 30:05.337
I'm sure you still have
feelings for each other.

30:05.371 --> 30:06.939
Hmm, not a good example.
Mm.

30:06.973 --> 30:08.407
I don't know.

30:08.440 --> 30:10.042
Okay, look, don't
let her win, okay?

30:10.076 --> 30:11.477
This is exactly
what my mom wants.

30:11.510 --> 30:13.312
See, the funny thing is,

30:13.345 --> 30:15.614
is that she seems to be
the only one seeing straight.

30:15.647 --> 30:16.883
Meaning what?

30:16.916 --> 30:18.584
Meaning come on, Wade!

30:18.617 --> 30:20.352
Seriously, what is the plan?

30:20.386 --> 30:23.155
What happens when Zoe gets tired
of playing Sweet Home Alabama

30:23.189 --> 30:24.523
and goes back to New York?

30:24.556 --> 30:26.859
What?
WADE:
Tansy, I don't know.

30:26.893 --> 30:28.995
All right?
I don't need to know the future.

30:29.028 --> 30:32.064
Because part of you knows
there is no future being

30:32.098 --> 30:34.533
Mr. Dr. Hart, the
bartending house-husband.

30:34.566 --> 30:38.104
Exactly! And George,
do you really

30:38.137 --> 30:40.639
see Tansy being the mother
of your children?

30:40.672 --> 30:42.441
Mom...
Well, what is that
supposed to mean?

30:42.474 --> 30:43.575
Mom, stop it.

30:43.609 --> 30:46.045
Okay? Nobody's
getting married here.

30:46.078 --> 30:50.649
Never? So, what,
was I a way to kill the time?

30:50.682 --> 30:52.885
No! Of course not.
She just...

30:52.919 --> 30:54.086
She has us having kids!

30:54.120 --> 30:56.255
Oh, which is such
a crazy idea, right?

30:56.288 --> 30:59.258
Forget it. I don't need this.

30:59.291 --> 31:01.627
I was trying
to have less drama in my life,

31:01.660 --> 31:03.930
not more.
If I wanted more,

31:03.963 --> 31:07.299
I would be with Todd Gainey Jr.
and his nest of girlfriends!

31:07.333 --> 31:08.968
Wait, Tansy...
Tansy, wait.

31:09.001 --> 31:10.602
Tansy...

31:10.636 --> 31:13.005
Well, hey, don't take the canoe!
GEORGE:
You can go ahead

31:13.039 --> 31:14.506
and stop all that
smiling, Mom, 'cause

31:14.540 --> 31:16.375
you're not gonna like
the way this ends.

31:16.408 --> 31:19.245
And you know what, Mom,
seriously--

31:19.278 --> 31:20.279
get another hobby.

31:23.950 --> 31:28.921
I'm not planning on going back
to New York anytime soon.

31:28.955 --> 31:31.190
Did I ask? No.

31:33.993 --> 31:35.161
(crickets chirping)

31:35.194 --> 31:36.562
AnnaBeth.
Hi.

31:36.595 --> 31:39.398
Now, I just gave Oliver
an injection of Sumatriptan

31:39.431 --> 31:41.067
for his migraines.

31:41.100 --> 31:43.135
Now, it goes to work
in a couple of minutes,

31:43.169 --> 31:44.403
but he's lying
down for now.

31:44.436 --> 31:46.105
And his... accent?

31:46.138 --> 31:47.639
Well, we don't
know yet,

31:47.673 --> 31:50.342
but whatever happens,
the most important thing is

31:50.376 --> 31:52.111
that I will finally have
an article

31:52.144 --> 31:54.981
in the Alabama Medical Review.
(laughs)

31:55.014 --> 31:57.049
See how you like
Foreign Accent Syndrome,

31:57.083 --> 31:59.485
Dr. O'Malley, and your
six-fingered twins.

31:59.518 --> 32:01.620
Brick, I can't thank you enough

32:01.653 --> 32:03.155
for helping him.

32:03.189 --> 32:05.357
Oh... well, you're welcome.

32:05.391 --> 32:07.093
(Brick chuckles)

32:07.126 --> 32:08.995
LEMON:
Unbelievable!

32:09.028 --> 32:10.629
Well, Lemon, what...?

32:10.662 --> 32:12.164
Sneaking around
like this!

32:12.198 --> 32:13.966
How dare you!

32:14.000 --> 32:15.334
We had to.

32:15.367 --> 32:17.736
He didn't want anyone to
know about his condition.

32:17.769 --> 32:19.571
What condition?
Well,

32:19.605 --> 32:21.407
I can't tell you.
But, uh, you know,

32:21.440 --> 32:22.741
with some luck,
you'll be able

32:22.774 --> 32:24.610
to read about it soon.
I don't want

32:24.643 --> 32:26.478
to read about it;
I want to know how

32:26.512 --> 32:28.314
you justify sleeping
with a girl half your age!

32:28.347 --> 32:29.748
Half my... Oh.

32:29.781 --> 32:31.017
Look-look,

32:31.050 --> 32:33.052
I never meant
for that to happen,

32:33.085 --> 32:36.355
but just sometimes you develop
feelings for a person, and...

32:36.388 --> 32:39.158
Not my best friend!
She's your best friend?

32:39.191 --> 32:41.693
Well, yes!
Well, that is great!
When did that happen?

32:41.727 --> 32:42.594
(gasps)

32:42.628 --> 32:43.529
Oh, my Lord.

32:43.562 --> 32:45.131
She means me.

32:45.164 --> 32:46.632
She what?

32:46.665 --> 32:48.267
Oh, my Lord!

32:48.300 --> 32:51.203
Lemon, this is insane!
On top of the fact

32:51.237 --> 32:54.073
that I told you,
I met this guy.

32:54.106 --> 32:55.174
Yes, your "British fellow."

32:55.207 --> 32:57.243
Except there are
no British men in BlueBell.

32:57.276 --> 32:58.710
Do you think that I'm stupid?

32:58.744 --> 33:00.246
There are so.
Where?

33:00.279 --> 33:01.713
There he is right now.

33:04.183 --> 33:06.052
(Southern accent):
Hello. I'm Oliver Kent.

33:06.085 --> 33:07.419
Very pleased to meet you.

33:07.453 --> 33:08.487
(exhales)

33:08.520 --> 33:10.356
Well, he was British.

33:10.389 --> 33:11.657
(stammering):
L-Lemon, just stop

33:11.690 --> 33:13.092
all this.

33:13.125 --> 33:16.128
It is not AnnaBeth
that I'm seeing.

33:16.162 --> 33:17.263
It is...

33:17.296 --> 33:18.697
Shelby.

33:20.066 --> 33:21.433
Oh, my Lord.

33:21.467 --> 33:24.636
And... I was
just about to tell you...
No.

33:24.670 --> 33:27.806
No. Shelby. Of course.

33:27.839 --> 33:29.408
(anxious laugh)
Well...

33:29.441 --> 33:31.343
I should be leaving now.

33:31.377 --> 33:33.112
And, AnnaBeth,
I am...

33:33.145 --> 33:34.413
so sorry.

33:34.446 --> 33:36.782
(clears throat)
Daddy, please give

33:36.815 --> 33:38.784
your girlfriend back
her underwear.

33:38.817 --> 33:40.786
And, Mr. Kent, it was...

33:40.819 --> 33:43.155
lovely to meet you.

33:45.224 --> 33:48.260
Well, she seemed very nice.

33:48.294 --> 33:50.462
How about these
miracle drugs, huh?

33:50.496 --> 33:52.331
M-My headache
is gone.

33:52.364 --> 33:54.233
I can't tell
about the accent.

33:54.266 --> 33:55.667
I'm still getting
used to it, so...

33:55.701 --> 33:57.603
I'm gonna have
to take your word for it.

33:57.636 --> 33:59.738
What do you say?

33:59.771 --> 34:02.408
Still sexy?

34:02.441 --> 34:04.543
Oh, yes!

34:04.576 --> 34:06.778
Mm! You bet!

34:06.812 --> 34:08.614
Good work!

34:08.647 --> 34:11.250
(chuckles)

34:11.283 --> 34:12.650
BRICK: Okay.

34:12.684 --> 34:14.620
(cooing quietly)

34:14.652 --> 34:18.157
Okay, you are...

34:18.190 --> 34:20.659
not wrong about
what you said in there.

34:20.692 --> 34:22.094
I hate that expression.

34:22.128 --> 34:23.795
It's lawyer talk.

34:23.829 --> 34:26.532
"You're not wrong"
means neither are you.

34:26.565 --> 34:28.266
(chuckling)

34:28.300 --> 34:30.302
Fair enough,
fair enough.

34:30.335 --> 34:32.138
Okay, how about this?

34:32.170 --> 34:33.705
The truth is, yes,

34:33.739 --> 34:36.375
there is a chance
that there might always be

34:36.408 --> 34:38.844
some type of... connection...

34:38.877 --> 34:41.280
between Zoe Hart and me.

34:42.714 --> 34:46.585
But my mom was
absolutely right.

34:46.618 --> 34:48.587
If we wanted to be together,

34:48.620 --> 34:50.422
we could be.

34:50.456 --> 34:52.891
I'm not, because...

34:52.924 --> 34:55.761
I don't want to be.

34:55.793 --> 34:58.130
I want to be with you.

34:59.631 --> 35:02.534
Because I'm happy.

35:02.568 --> 35:03.869
And you know what?

35:03.902 --> 35:07.339
If I never end up
with Zoe Hart...

35:07.373 --> 35:09.741
I'm realizing that
would be completely fine.

35:09.775 --> 35:10.842
(both laugh)

35:10.876 --> 35:12.278
ZOE:
Wow.

35:12.311 --> 35:14.313
Zoe, I...

35:14.346 --> 35:15.881
No, it's...
it's okay.

35:15.914 --> 35:18.417
I meant, wow...

35:18.450 --> 35:19.818
me, too.

35:19.851 --> 35:21.587
You know, I guess...

35:21.620 --> 35:24.390
I just always thought,
in the back of my mind,

35:24.423 --> 35:26.525
that I'd end up with George.

35:26.558 --> 35:28.227
You know,
that was the plan.

35:28.260 --> 35:29.295
But as shocking

35:29.328 --> 35:32.364
as it sounds, I'm actually
really happy with Wade.

35:32.398 --> 35:34.233
WADE:
I can hear you!

35:34.266 --> 35:36.368
(laughs)

35:36.402 --> 35:38.370
(laughs softly)

35:38.404 --> 35:40.372
Yeah.

35:40.406 --> 35:43.942
I-I guess I always
just kind of...

35:43.975 --> 35:48.247
saw us circling back
towards each other at
some point, you know?

35:48.280 --> 35:49.881
But...
Yeah.

35:49.915 --> 35:53.852
But maybe we're just not
in the same orbit anymore.

35:53.885 --> 35:56.188
We're headed
for different planets.

35:56.222 --> 35:57.723
Which is okay.

35:57.756 --> 35:59.791
Well, then you're
in luck, because...

35:59.825 --> 36:02.194
Wade Kinsella is definitely
on a different planet.

36:02.228 --> 36:04.863
WADE:
Yup, I can still hear you!

36:04.896 --> 36:06.198
(laughs)

36:08.800 --> 36:11.570
Well, all right, then.

36:14.906 --> 36:18.610
I better go break
the news to Mom.

36:18.644 --> 36:20.646
She's gonna take it
really hard.

36:20.679 --> 36:23.215
(laughs)

36:27.386 --> 36:29.521
(shouts):
How about us? We good?

36:29.555 --> 36:31.923
WADE:
Yup.
Just checking.

36:43.735 --> 36:45.737
(birds chirping)

36:49.007 --> 36:50.742
So when's the wedding?

36:50.776 --> 36:52.378
Shut up, Harold.

36:59.918 --> 37:01.487
Uh, just one.

37:01.520 --> 37:04.323
Let me clear a table for you.

37:08.827 --> 37:10.662
Morning, A.B.

37:11.697 --> 37:13.465
Hi.
Heh. So, uh,

37:13.499 --> 37:15.901
um, how is your
friend, uh...

37:15.934 --> 37:17.469
Oliver, is it?

37:17.503 --> 37:19.037
Odd you should ask.

37:19.070 --> 37:21.607
Seems you ran
into him last night.

37:21.640 --> 37:23.542
Well, i-it's... you know,
it's hard to say.

37:23.575 --> 37:26.044
I meet a lot of people
in my line of work.

37:26.077 --> 37:27.813
Well, he told me
this funny story

37:27.846 --> 37:28.814
about that accent of his,

37:28.847 --> 37:31.383
and then Brick gave him
some medicine, and bang,

37:31.417 --> 37:32.484
no more accent.

37:32.518 --> 37:34.753
Huh. So a happy ending.

37:34.786 --> 37:36.488
Mm. Then he left me

37:36.522 --> 37:38.690
this message this morning.

37:38.724 --> 37:41.059
OLIVER (British accent):
AnnaBeth, I just wanted to say

37:41.092 --> 37:42.694
it was lovely to meet you,

37:42.728 --> 37:44.963
and I do hope
we can meet again someday,

37:44.996 --> 37:46.698
but I must be moving on.

37:46.732 --> 37:49.901
To somewhere that they
don't know me, I think.

37:49.935 --> 37:52.338
At least not as anything
but jolly Oliver Kent

37:52.371 --> 37:53.739
from "merrie olde England."

37:53.772 --> 37:55.474
Thank you, though.

37:55.507 --> 37:56.575
Now...

37:56.608 --> 37:58.877
pip-pip, cheerio.
Bye, then, love.

38:00.479 --> 38:02.381
So what, the
medicine wore off?

38:02.414 --> 38:04.483
Nope. Now he's faking it.

38:04.516 --> 38:05.551
What for?

38:05.584 --> 38:07.519
Because he could
see it in my eyes.

38:08.520 --> 38:10.956
I told him
I'd feel the same, but...

38:10.989 --> 38:14.360
he saw in my face the second
he started to talk and...

38:14.393 --> 38:17.996
he was...
just like everyone else.

38:18.029 --> 38:20.065
Hm.

38:20.098 --> 38:22.000
Am I a terrible person, Lavon?

38:22.033 --> 38:24.470
What? No, of course not.

38:24.503 --> 38:25.771
I am so shallow.

38:25.804 --> 38:29.341
No! Now, AnnaBeth Nass,
you are a good person.

38:29.375 --> 38:31.543
Now, you just tried
to help the guy.

38:31.577 --> 38:33.044
He doesn't know
himself, is all.

38:33.078 --> 38:36.515
A lot of that going around.

38:38.049 --> 38:40.752
But thanks
for looking out for me.

38:42.454 --> 38:45.824
Ah. Me, I think
you're better off.

38:45.857 --> 38:48.927
Having to learn
all those English way
of saying things...

38:48.960 --> 38:50.462
Lift.

38:50.496 --> 38:51.897
Petrol.

38:51.930 --> 38:53.399
Quidditch.

38:53.432 --> 38:54.533
(chuckles)

38:54.566 --> 38:56.067
Who needs it?
(laughs)

38:56.101 --> 38:58.069
No, you're right.

38:58.103 --> 38:59.571
AnnaBeth?

39:02.608 --> 39:05.544
Come on, I'll
buy you a coffee.

39:05.577 --> 39:07.579
Okay.

39:09.748 --> 39:11.750
*

39:24.930 --> 39:27.499
(sighs)
There they are.

39:27.533 --> 39:29.000
Ready for lunch?

39:29.034 --> 39:29.968
BRICK:
We are.

39:30.001 --> 39:31.437
We are.

39:31.470 --> 39:33.439
And, sweetheart,
I am so tickled that

39:33.472 --> 39:35.407
you came around
to this so quickly.

39:35.441 --> 39:36.875
To have this

39:36.908 --> 39:37.976
out in the open!

39:38.009 --> 39:39.110
Aw...
The two of you

39:39.144 --> 39:41.480
with me just means the world.

39:42.481 --> 39:43.749
Oh, Daddy, all I ever want

39:43.782 --> 39:45.150
is for you to be happy.

39:45.183 --> 39:49.154
I'm sorry to both of you that
I was such a pill about it.
Oh. Well,

39:49.187 --> 39:51.757
come on, let's go!
(laughs)

39:51.790 --> 39:52.958
Uh, Lemon... me, too.

39:52.991 --> 39:54.526
I am so really, really sorry

39:54.560 --> 39:56.895
that I had to deceive
you like that.

39:56.928 --> 40:00.065
But I just think that
we are gonna become the
very best of friends.

40:00.098 --> 40:01.500
(laughs)

40:01.533 --> 40:03.502
Yes, well, about that...

40:03.535 --> 40:06.037
I don't know what your game is,
but don't get too comfortable,

40:06.071 --> 40:09.775
because I'm gonna have you
out of here and back into
the Panhandle within a week.

40:09.808 --> 40:11.543
Let's eat.

40:13.579 --> 40:15.447
(sighs)

40:15.481 --> 40:17.483
*

40:21.487 --> 40:24.923
Hey, Wally, how much
you figure a bartender
makes in New York City?

40:24.956 --> 40:27.593
More than here, if that's
what you're getting at.

40:27.626 --> 40:29.961
But a bartender in
New York City also
lives in New Jersey.

40:29.995 --> 40:32.163
Now, you ain't gonna
catch me in New Jersey.

40:32.197 --> 40:33.732
I went to Newark one time,

40:33.765 --> 40:35.967
saw a man wearing
his pants like a hat.

40:36.001 --> 40:37.135
You can have it.

40:40.739 --> 40:42.541
Hey.

40:42.574 --> 40:44.242
Oh. Hey.

40:44.275 --> 40:45.844
Uh, I'm just wrapping up here.

40:45.877 --> 40:47.679
You want to grab a bite to eat?

40:47.713 --> 40:49.581
Yes. I will
get us a table.

40:49.615 --> 40:50.148
All right.

40:52.083 --> 40:53.885
(clears throat)

40:53.919 --> 40:55.020
Oh.

40:56.655 --> 40:57.589
(laughs)
Hi.

40:57.623 --> 40:59.591
Hi.
Hey. Um...

41:00.926 --> 41:02.661
You know,
we could just...

41:04.896 --> 41:06.231
Hey, look, look,
it's a small town

41:06.264 --> 41:10.669
and it is what it is,
so if we're all gonna
be in the same boat,

41:10.702 --> 41:14.472
well, we might as well be
rowing in the same direction.

41:15.974 --> 41:17.676
All right.

41:17.709 --> 41:19.545
Well, all right, then.

41:24.282 --> 41:25.584
Menus.

41:25.617 --> 41:26.652
Tucker.

41:26.685 --> 41:28.654
(sighs)
(clears throat)

41:28.687 --> 41:31.189
Hmm...

41:31.222 --> 41:32.858
I read that, uh,
 Book of Mormon is

41:32.891 --> 41:33.992
coming to Birmingham
next month.

41:34.025 --> 41:36.127
Maybe we all could go.

41:36.161 --> 41:37.596
Really?
That actually sounds great...

41:37.629 --> 41:39.998
No.
Not a chance.

41:40.031 --> 41:41.299
Right.

41:41.332 --> 41:43.134
Uh, we're good.

41:43.168 --> 41:44.135
Yeah, whatever.

41:44.169 --> 41:46.805
(laughter)

41:46.838 --> 41:48.907
