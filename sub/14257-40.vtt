01:07.071 --> 01:11.040
I AM
SERIOUSLY STARVED,
DUDES.

01:11.041 --> 01:14.009
THERE'S ONLY ONE
CURE FOR THESE
MONDO MUNCHIES.

01:14.010 --> 01:16.011
NO TIME FOR PIZZA, GUYS.

01:16.012 --> 01:17.545
WE HAVE TO CHECK OUT
APRIL'S TIP

01:17.546 --> 01:19.346
ABOUT SHREDDER BEING SEEN
IN THE VICINITY.

01:20.515 --> 01:22.015
HEY, GUYS, LOOK!

01:22.016 --> 01:25.518
SOME GOON IS MUGGING
THAT OLD LADY.

01:25.519 --> 01:29.054
GIVE ME THAT HANDBAG,
UH...LADY.

01:29.055 --> 01:32.790
NEVER, YOU EVIL MAN.

01:32.791 --> 01:36.427
COME ON, DUDES.
LET'S BLEEP THAT CREEP.

01:36.428 --> 01:39.562
OOH--I SAID,
GIVE ME THAT THING.

01:39.563 --> 01:42.063
NEVER, NEVER, NEVER!

01:42.064 --> 01:43.632
DIDN'T ANYONE
EVER TELL YOU

01:43.633 --> 01:46.134
IT'S NOT NICE TO MUG
SWEET OLD LADIES?

01:46.135 --> 01:48.369
SAYS WHO?

01:48.370 --> 01:49.638
YOU BIG BRUTE!

01:49.639 --> 01:52.873
YOU SHOULD BE
ASHAMED.

01:52.874 --> 01:55.642
I'LL TAKE CARE
OF YOU, LADY,

01:55.643 --> 01:59.646
AFTER I SPLATTER
THESE GREEN FREAKS
ALL OVER THE WALL.

01:59.647 --> 02:02.547
HEY, PUT ME DOWN!

02:04.583 --> 02:06.083
CATCH, RAPHAEL.

02:07.385 --> 02:10.053
WHOA! HOT POTATO!

02:10.054 --> 02:11.587
CATCH, MICHELANGELO.

02:11.588 --> 02:15.490
OH, LIKE, TAKE A HIKE,
LUMPY LIPS.

02:16.593 --> 02:19.994
OOH, I'M GETTIN'
OUT OF HERE.

02:19.995 --> 02:22.062
WHOA, WHAT A WIMP!

02:22.063 --> 02:24.230
THAT WAS A PIECE OF CAKE.

02:24.231 --> 02:27.133
HE WON'T BOTHER
YOU AGAIN, MA'AM.

02:27.134 --> 02:30.903
WELL, UH,
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

02:30.904 --> 02:34.739
OH, NO THANKS NEEDED,
ELDERLY DUDETTE.

02:34.740 --> 02:37.574
LET ME GIVE YOU
A LITTLE REWARD--

02:37.575 --> 02:40.243
FRESH-BAKED
CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIES.

02:41.245 --> 02:43.245
WHY,
THANK YOU, MA'AM.

02:43.246 --> 02:45.915
I GOTTA HOBBLE ALONG NOW.

02:45.916 --> 02:46.915
BYE!

02:46.916 --> 02:50.251
THAT'S A SWEET
LITTLE OLD LADY.

02:50.252 --> 02:52.086
HMM. I WONDER.

02:52.087 --> 02:55.387
WELL, THEY'RE
NOT PIZZA,

02:55.388 --> 02:57.256
BUT AT LEAST
THEY'RE ROUND.

02:57.257 --> 02:59.792
WAIT, MICHELANGELO!
WE CAN'T EAT COOKIES

02:59.793 --> 03:02.360
IF WE WANT TO STAY
IN FIGHTING TRIM.

03:02.361 --> 03:04.996
BESIDES, I'D
LIKE TO RUN SOME
TESTS ON THESE COOKIES.

03:04.997 --> 03:08.099
THERE WAS SOMETHING
FUNNY ABOUT THAT OLD LADY.

03:09.701 --> 03:12.368
THEY BOUGHT IT,
BOSS.

03:12.369 --> 03:13.770
AMAZING!

03:13.770 --> 03:16.205
YOU OAFS ACTUALLY
MANAGED TO PULL IT OFF.

03:16.206 --> 03:19.207
THOSE COOKIES
WILL SPELL THE END

03:19.208 --> 03:22.977
OF THE TEENAGE MUTANT
NINJA TURTLES.

03:22.978 --> 03:26.080
THIS IS TOTALLY
LAMEOLA, DUDE--

03:26.081 --> 03:30.349
WASTING PERFECTLY GOOD
CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIES.

03:30.350 --> 03:32.316
OK, GUYS. LET'S SEE
WHAT HAPPENS

03:32.317 --> 03:34.853
WHEN I DROP THIS COOKIE
IN THIS BEAKER.

03:36.089 --> 03:38.189
HA! JUST AS I SUSPECTED.

03:38.190 --> 03:40.491
THEY WEREN'T MADE
WITH BAKING SODA.

03:40.492 --> 03:42.925
THEY'RE MADE WITH SOME
KIND OF ANTI-MUTAGEN.

03:42.926 --> 03:45.095
THIS MUST BE
SHREDDER'S WORK.

03:45.096 --> 03:47.429
ONE BITE OF THESE,

03:47.430 --> 03:48.964
AND WE MIGHT HAVE
ALL DEGENERATED

03:48.965 --> 03:51.366
INTO LOWER FORMS
OF LIFE.

03:51.367 --> 03:52.800
YOU MEAN LIKE SLUGS?

03:52.801 --> 03:54.235
OR WORMS?

03:54.236 --> 03:55.301
OR AMOEBAS?

03:55.302 --> 03:57.971
WORSE. HUMAN BEINGS.

03:57.972 --> 03:59.539
HUMAN BEINGS?

03:59.540 --> 04:02.541
WELL, THAT COULD BE
TOTALLY TUBULAR.

04:02.542 --> 04:05.276
SURFING,
GOING TO PARTIES,

04:05.277 --> 04:07.378
MEETING CHICKS.

04:07.379 --> 04:09.880
I ALWAYS WONDERED
WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE

04:09.881 --> 04:12.215
TO RIDE IN A WESTERN RODEO.

04:12.216 --> 04:14.550
SO, WHAT ARE WE
WAITING FOR, DUDES?

04:14.551 --> 04:16.351
LET'S CHOW DOWN.

04:16.353 --> 04:19.187
NO, NO! YOU MUSTN'T!

04:19.188 --> 04:21.022
DONATELLO IS RIGHT,
MY STUDENTS.

04:21.023 --> 04:25.091
AS HUMANS, YOU WOULD LOSE
YOUR NINJA SKILLS AND POWERS.

04:25.092 --> 04:28.594
THE CITY WOULD BE
AT THE MERCY OF SHREDDER
AND KRANG.

04:28.595 --> 04:32.564
THAT'S WHY I'M TOSSING
THESE COOKIES
IN THE GARBAGE.

04:35.167 --> 04:39.837
OH, WELL, IT WAS
A SWEET DREAM
WHILE IT LASTED.

04:39.838 --> 04:44.207
AS SOON AS THE TURTLES
BECOME WEAK HUMANS,

04:44.208 --> 04:46.675
WE WILL CRUSH THEM
LIKE BUGS.

04:46.676 --> 04:51.545
HA HA--OH, BOY!
I LOVE TO CRUSH BUGS.

04:51.546 --> 04:53.314
UH, WHAT MAKES YOU
THINK THE TURTLES

04:53.315 --> 04:55.682
WILL EAT
THOSE COOKIES, BOSS?

04:55.683 --> 04:59.019
WHAT TEENAGER CAN RESIST
CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIES?

04:59.020 --> 05:02.021
WHY, SHREDDER!
I DIDN'T KNOW BAKING

05:02.022 --> 05:04.789
WAS ONE OF YOUR THINGS.

05:04.790 --> 05:07.191
A NINJA WARRIOR
IS TRAINED

05:07.192 --> 05:09.827
IN MANY SKILLS, KRANG.
HA HA HA!

05:09.828 --> 05:13.530
I KNOW A SPLENDID
RECIPE FOR BOILED BRAIN.

05:13.531 --> 05:15.098
OH, A COMEDIAN.

05:15.099 --> 05:16.599
SPARE ME!

05:16.600 --> 05:21.903
IT'S TIME TO EXECUTE
PHASE TWO OF OUR PLAN.

05:21.904 --> 05:25.373
THIS SHIP HAS A CARGO OF
ELECTRONIC PARTS WE NEED

05:25.374 --> 05:28.007
TO REPAIR THE TECHNODROME,

05:28.008 --> 05:32.010
AND YOU TWO ARE
GOING TO STEAL IT.

05:32.011 --> 05:34.413
ALL BY OURSELVES?

05:34.414 --> 05:38.549
NO. WE NEED PEOPLE WHO
LOOK LIKE WATERFRONT TYPES,

05:38.550 --> 05:41.052
NOT RHINOS AND WART HOGS.

05:41.053 --> 05:43.586
FIND THAT GANG YOU
ONCE BELONGED TO,

05:43.587 --> 05:45.821
AND USE THEM
FOR THE JOB.

05:45.822 --> 05:48.590
GEE...OUR
OLD GANG...

05:48.591 --> 05:52.393
I WONDER IF THEY'LL
RECOGNIZE US?

05:52.394 --> 05:54.362
MOVE IT...NOW.

05:56.464 --> 05:59.966
IF WE DON'T STOP
THIS RATINGS SLIDE SOON,

05:59.967 --> 06:01.433
WE'LL BE
IN THE CELLAR.

06:01.434 --> 06:04.069
AND I DON'T HAVE TO
TELL YOU PEOPLE

06:04.070 --> 06:05.170
WHAT THAT MEANS.

06:05.171 --> 06:08.506
I'VE GOT A REALLY
HOT IDEA, BOSS.

06:08.507 --> 06:10.641
HOW ABOUT A SHOW
ON MATCHBOOK
COLLECTING?

06:10.642 --> 06:13.077
AS A MATTER OF FACT,
I HAVE--
[BUZZER SOUNDS]

06:13.078 --> 06:14.343
NEXT.

06:14.344 --> 06:18.246
WHAT ABOUT AN EXPOSE
ON BIG CITY GANGS?

06:18.247 --> 06:20.949
HMM. MAYBE
YOU'VE GOT SOMETHING.

06:20.950 --> 06:24.652
VIOLENCE, CRIME,
BRUTALITY--

06:24.653 --> 06:27.621
ALL THE ELEMENTS
OF GREAT FAMILY VIEWING.

06:27.622 --> 06:28.855
GET ON IT, APRIL.

06:28.856 --> 06:30.223
RIGHT AWAY, CHIEF.

06:31.492 --> 06:33.059
HMM...NOT BAD.

06:33.060 --> 06:37.028
I THINK I CAN PASS MYSELF
OFF AS A GANG MEMBER.

06:37.029 --> 06:39.564
MEAN STREETS,
HERE I COME.

06:42.400 --> 06:45.436
I'LL JUST LEAVE A NOTE,
SO THE GUYS WON'T WORRY.

06:45.437 --> 06:49.705
IT WILL BE MONDO TUBULOSO
TO BE HUMAN.

06:49.706 --> 06:54.075
DONATELLO DID SAY IT
COULD BE A MAJOR BUMMER.

06:54.076 --> 06:56.677
I'LL NEVER KNOW
IF I DON'T TRY.

07:02.616 --> 07:05.083
NOTHING'S HAPPENING.

07:05.084 --> 07:08.621
THAT WHOLE STORY
MUST BE BOGUS.

07:08.622 --> 07:11.589
BESIDES, THESE COOKIES
DON'T EVEN TASTE GOOD.

07:16.994 --> 07:19.095
MY HANDS!

07:19.096 --> 07:20.729
MY FACE!

07:20.730 --> 07:22.064
MY FEET!

07:22.065 --> 07:25.800
I'M CHANGING,
BUT INTO WHAT?

07:36.076 --> 07:38.543
WHOA, WHAT HAPPENED?

07:38.544 --> 07:41.012
HUMAN HANDS?

07:41.013 --> 07:43.481
BODACIOUS!
WHERE'S A MIRROR?

07:43.482 --> 07:45.615
I GOT TO CHECK THIS OUT.

07:46.917 --> 07:48.418
I'M HUMAN.

07:48.419 --> 07:50.652
A HUMAN TEENAGER.

07:50.653 --> 07:52.454
A HUNKY ONE, AT THAT.

07:53.956 --> 07:56.457
WHAT AM I WAITING FOR?

07:56.458 --> 07:58.459
BRIGHT LIGHTS,
BIG CITY,

07:58.460 --> 08:01.961
HERE COMES
MICHAEL J. ANGELO.

08:05.765 --> 08:07.099
RADICAL WHEELS,
DUDE.

08:07.100 --> 08:08.900
THINK YOU CAN
SHRED THE COURSE?

08:08.901 --> 08:11.002
ARE YOU KIDDING, DUDE?

08:11.003 --> 08:14.505
YOU ARE TALKING
TO A NINJA TUR--

08:14.506 --> 08:16.440
UH, SKATEBOARD WIZARD.

08:16.441 --> 08:19.975
OK, WIZ. LET'S SEE SOME
OF THOSE NINJA MOVES.

08:21.878 --> 08:23.778
I WASN'T READY!

08:27.882 --> 08:29.450
HA HA--SOME WIZARD.

08:29.451 --> 08:31.951
MY GRANDMOTHER HAS
BETTER MOVES THAN THAT.

08:36.123 --> 08:39.525
WAY TO GO, CLUMSY.
WHAT A DWEEB!

08:39.525 --> 08:43.126
MAN. BEING HUMAN
ISN'T ALL THAT EXCELLENT.

08:43.128 --> 08:47.130
MAYBE I SHOULD HAVE
LISTENED TO MASTER SPLINTER.

08:47.131 --> 08:48.632
THAT DOES IT!
I'VE HAD IT!

08:48.633 --> 08:51.967
I'M GOING BACK
TO THE LAIR.

08:51.968 --> 08:52.968
HELP!

08:52.969 --> 08:54.935
HELP!

08:54.936 --> 08:58.439
LOOKS LIKE
THAT DUDETTE'S
IN SERIOUS TROUBLE.

08:58.440 --> 09:00.807
OUT OF THE WAY, TWERP.

09:02.877 --> 09:04.443
THAT TEARS IT.

09:04.444 --> 09:06.879
NOW I'M TRULY STEAMED.

09:12.918 --> 09:15.319
OK, BABE,
SUPPOSE YOU TELL US

09:15.320 --> 09:18.988
WHY YOU WERE SNOOPIN'
AROUND OUR TURF.

09:18.989 --> 09:21.324
UH, WELL, YOU SEE...

09:21.325 --> 09:22.758
THAT IS...

09:22.759 --> 09:24.059
THAT GIRL'S VOICE.

09:24.060 --> 09:25.828
IT SOUNDS FAMILIAR.

09:25.829 --> 09:27.895
UH, LET ME AT HER,
LUGNUT.

09:27.896 --> 09:29.930
I'LL TEACH HER
TO SPY ON US.

09:29.931 --> 09:30.931
IT'S APRIL.

09:30.932 --> 09:34.901
WAIT A SEC, GUYS.
YOU GOT IT ALL WRONG.

09:34.902 --> 09:37.436
I WASN'T SPYING,
I WAS, UH...UH--

09:37.437 --> 09:38.671
CHECKING YOU OUT.

09:38.672 --> 09:42.306
<i>HEH HEH HEH!
YOU CHECKING US OUT?</i>

09:42.307 --> 09:45.076
YEAH. I WANTED TO SEE
IF YOU WERE TOUGH ENOUGH

09:45.077 --> 09:47.010
TO HAVE ME AS A MEMBER.

09:51.281 --> 09:55.150
SO, YOU THINK YOU'RE
REAL TOUGH, DO YOU?

09:55.151 --> 09:58.453
WELL...FAIRLY TOUGH.

09:58.454 --> 10:01.622
YEAH? WELL, WE'LL
JUST SEE ABOUT THAT.

10:01.623 --> 10:03.956
IF YOU CAN TAKE ON
JERSEY RED HERE

10:03.957 --> 10:05.891
IN A FIGHT TO THE FINISH,

10:05.892 --> 10:07.960
YOU'RE IN THE GANG.

10:07.961 --> 10:10.862
I'M GONNA EAT
YOUSE ALIVE!

10:10.863 --> 10:13.131
WE'LL CATCH YOU
LATER, RED,

10:13.132 --> 10:17.634
AFTER YOU WIPE UP
THE PLACE
WITH THIS SNOOP.

10:20.971 --> 10:22.871
I GUESS I SHOWED HER.

10:22.872 --> 10:25.141
LOOKS BAD.

10:25.142 --> 10:28.610
JERSEY RED IS
GOING TO POUND APRIL
INTO PIZZA DOUGH.

10:30.946 --> 10:34.814
BODACIOUS! I'M CHANGING
BACK INTO A TURTLE.

10:34.815 --> 10:37.517
IT MUST BE THE ADRENALINE
IN MY BLOODSTREAM.

10:37.518 --> 10:40.186
YOU DON'T KNOW
WHEN TO QUIT DO YA?

10:41.620 --> 10:43.788
GUESS I HAVE
TO TEACH YA.

10:43.789 --> 10:45.656
APRIL, DUCK!

10:52.229 --> 10:54.930
TURTLE POWER
DOES IT AGAIN.

10:54.931 --> 10:57.299
HEY, RED, YOU DONE YET?

10:57.300 --> 11:00.968
WHOA! WHAT HIT ME?

11:00.969 --> 11:04.971
I DON'T KNOW HOW
YOU DID IT, BABE,

11:04.972 --> 11:07.974
BUT LOOKS LIKE
YOU'RE THE WINNER.

11:07.975 --> 11:09.475
WHY, I AM?

11:09.476 --> 11:11.977
THEN I'M IN THE GANG?

11:11.978 --> 11:14.145
NOT SO FAST.

11:14.146 --> 11:18.248
YOU GOTTA
BURGLARIZE A PAD
AND BRING US THE LOOT.

11:18.249 --> 11:20.850
YOU MEAN BREAKING
AND ENTERING?

11:20.851 --> 11:23.152
HEY, WHAT'S
THE MATTER? CHICKEN?

11:23.153 --> 11:25.154
NO WAY.

11:25.155 --> 11:28.156
IN FACT, I KNOW
JUST THE PERSON TO ROB.

11:28.157 --> 11:30.358
WELL, WHAT ARE WE
WAITING FOR?

11:30.359 --> 11:32.893
LET'S GO!

11:32.894 --> 11:35.396
APRIL'S GETTING IN
WAY OVER HER HEAD.

11:35.397 --> 11:37.363
I'D BETTER FOLLOW HER.

11:37.364 --> 11:39.399
HAS ANYBODY SEEN
MICHELANGELO?

11:39.400 --> 11:41.900
I THINK HE'S STILL UPSET
ABOUT THOSE COOKIES.

11:43.403 --> 11:44.969
WHAT WAS THAT?

11:44.970 --> 11:46.470
IT CAME FROM THE LAB.

11:49.474 --> 11:51.407
IT'S
THE ANTI-MUTAGEN.

11:51.408 --> 11:53.176
IT EXPLODED.

11:53.177 --> 11:55.043
IT'S UNSTABLE.

11:55.044 --> 11:57.546
IT'S A GOOD THING
NONE OF US TRIED THAT STUFF.

11:57.547 --> 12:00.114
BUT
I FEAR ONE OF YOU HAS.

12:00.115 --> 12:02.350
SEE THIS NOTE
MICHELANGELO LEFT?

12:04.118 --> 12:06.853
"DEAR DUDES,
IF THESE COOKIES
AREN'T BOGUS,

12:06.854 --> 12:09.155
"BY THE TIME YOU
SCOPE THIS NOTE,

12:09.156 --> 12:12.024
I'LL BE HUMAN.
COWABUNGA!"

12:12.025 --> 12:13.858
LET'S GO FIND HIM.

12:13.859 --> 12:16.060
WAIT,
MY IMPETUOUS DISCIPLES.

12:16.061 --> 12:18.362
FINDING HIM WILL NOT HELP

12:18.363 --> 12:20.931
IF YOU DO NOT
HAVE AN ANTIDOTE
TO THE FORMULA.

12:20.932 --> 12:23.466
I'M WORKING ON IT
RIGHT NOW.

12:23.467 --> 12:26.236
WHEW. THIS WAS
A WHOLE LOT EASIER

12:26.237 --> 12:27.769
WHEN I WAS A TURTLE.

12:27.770 --> 12:29.304
WHAT LUCK!

12:29.305 --> 12:31.005
APRIL'S WINDOW'S OPEN.

12:36.544 --> 12:38.611
I'LL BE BACK IN A FLASH
WITH THE STASH.

12:41.247 --> 12:43.014
YO, DUDETTE!

12:44.016 --> 12:45.516
HEY, CHILL OUT!

12:45.517 --> 12:47.385
I'M A FRIEND.

12:47.386 --> 12:49.554
OH, YEAH? PROVE IT.

12:49.555 --> 12:52.723
I'M THE DUDE WHO
TOSSED JERSEY RED
IN THAT DUMPSTER.

12:52.724 --> 12:54.890
SO THAT'S HOW I DID THAT.

12:54.891 --> 12:57.359
AND YOU TOLD ME
TO DUCK, TOO!

12:57.360 --> 13:00.528
BUT ANYWAY, WHAT
ARE YOU DOING
IN MY APARTMENT?

13:00.529 --> 13:04.931
I CAME TO WARN YOU
THAT GANG'S MONDO RUDE--

13:04.932 --> 13:06.567
UH, REALLY DANGEROUS.

13:06.568 --> 13:07.968
THANKS FOR THE WARNING,

13:07.969 --> 13:11.104
BUT I'M A REPORTER
ON A HOT STORY.

13:11.105 --> 13:14.539
SURE HOPE THIS JUNK JEWELRY
OF MINE FOOLS THOSE GOONS.

13:14.540 --> 13:15.907
WHAT DO YA THINK?

13:17.743 --> 13:19.477
UH--EH--GOTTA RUN.

13:19.478 --> 13:21.479
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

13:21.480 --> 13:22.479
MICHELANGELO?

13:22.480 --> 13:23.980
IT'S YOU!

13:23.981 --> 13:27.949
I GUESS
I BETTER GIVE YOU
THE STRAIGHT SCOOP.

13:27.950 --> 13:29.284
WHERE DO WE START?

13:29.285 --> 13:32.420
THERE ARE
12 MILLION PEOPLE
IN THIS CITY.

13:32.421 --> 13:34.255
LOOK! THAT'S HIM.

13:34.256 --> 13:36.657
YOU'RE RIGHT.
IT'S MICHELANGELO

13:36.658 --> 13:38.592
AS A HUMAN TEENAGER.

13:38.593 --> 13:40.293
MICHELANGELO!

13:40.294 --> 13:42.995
WHOA!
TWO-LEGGED TURTLES.

13:42.996 --> 13:44.664
YOU SURE GAVE US
A SCARE.

13:44.665 --> 13:46.364
<i>I GAVE YOU
A SCARE.</i>

13:46.365 --> 13:49.633
HEY, HOLD STILL
WHILE I SPRAY YOU
WITH THIS ANTIDOTE.

13:49.634 --> 13:52.803
COOL IT
WITH THAT STUFF!

13:52.804 --> 13:54.138
UH, DONATELLO,

13:54.139 --> 13:56.372
HOW LONG IS THIS
FORMULA SUPPOSED
TO TAKE?

13:56.373 --> 13:57.640
IT'S INSTANTANEOUS.

13:57.641 --> 13:58.974
UH, CORRECT ME
IF I'M WRONG,

13:58.975 --> 14:01.777
BUT DOESN'T INSTANTANEOUS
MEAN RIGHT AWAY?

14:01.778 --> 14:04.211
OH, WOW!
THIS IS EXCELLENT.

14:04.212 --> 14:06.213
MY PIMPLES
ARE HISTORY.

14:06.214 --> 14:08.881
HEY, THANKS, GUYS.

14:08.882 --> 14:10.883
THAT WASN'T
MICHELANGELO.

14:10.884 --> 14:12.984
WE'RE LOSING
VALUABLE TIME.

14:12.985 --> 14:15.487
THE ANTI-MUTAGEN
IN MICHELANGELO'S SYSTEM

14:15.488 --> 14:17.488
COULD ALREADY
BE UNSTABLE.

14:17.489 --> 14:18.989
WHICH MEANS?

14:18.990 --> 14:22.259
THAT MICHELANGELO IS
A WALKING TIME BOMB.

14:27.397 --> 14:29.365
BUT APRIL, THIS IS
TOO DANGEROUS.

14:29.366 --> 14:31.866
THIS MUTAGEN
IS SO UNSTABLE,

14:31.867 --> 14:34.902
I DON'T KNOW
WHEN I'M GONNA
LOSE MY TURTLE POWERS.

14:34.903 --> 14:36.537
THAT'S OK,
MICHELANGELO,

14:36.538 --> 14:38.872
I DON'T NEED
ANYONE'S HELP.

14:38.873 --> 14:41.340
UH-OH, THE GANG'S
ALL HERE.

14:41.341 --> 14:43.375
I BETTER STAY
OUT OF SIGHT.

14:43.376 --> 14:47.045
OK. YOU GOT
THE, UH, MERCHANDISE?

14:47.046 --> 14:51.048
RIGHT HERE.
IT WAS A PIECE OF CAKE.

14:51.049 --> 14:52.550
AHH...NICE LOOT.

14:52.551 --> 14:55.652
ALL RIGHT, BABE.
YOU'RE IN THE GANG.

15:00.590 --> 15:03.557
WHAT'S THAT?
A RUNAWAY SUBWAY CAR?

15:03.558 --> 15:05.659
YO, LUGNUT!

15:05.660 --> 15:07.061
HIGH FIVE!

15:07.062 --> 15:08.695
JERSEY RED!

15:08.696 --> 15:11.765
UH-OH, IT'S ROCK STEADY
AND BEBOP.

15:11.766 --> 15:14.299
WHAT DO YOU
FREAKS WANT?

15:14.300 --> 15:16.569
DON'T YOU
RECOGNIZE US?

15:16.570 --> 15:20.905
OH, WE'RE YOUR OLD BUDDIES,
BEBOP AND ROCK STEADY.

15:20.906 --> 15:22.973
YOU CAN'T FOOL US.

15:22.974 --> 15:26.809
YOU GUYS ARE
BETTER LOOKING
THAN THEY WERE.

15:26.810 --> 15:29.611
MAYBE THIS WILL
CONVINCE YOU.

15:34.283 --> 15:35.649
NICE. I'M CONVINCED.

15:35.650 --> 15:38.419
NOBODY ELSE BUT BEBOP
AND ROCK STEADY

15:38.420 --> 15:40.420
WOULD BE SO DUMB.

15:40.421 --> 15:43.856
SO HOW COME
YOU GOT TURNED
INTO ANIMALS?

15:43.857 --> 15:45.824
WE'LL TELL YOU LATER.

15:45.825 --> 15:49.827
MEANWHILE, WE GOT
A JOB FOR YOUR GANG.

15:49.828 --> 15:51.963
THIS RAY WILL
MAKE ANY TRACES

15:51.964 --> 15:54.164
OF THE ANTI-MUTAGEN
GLOW GREEN.

15:54.165 --> 15:57.000
MAYBE WE CAN PICK UP
MICHELANGELO'S TRAIL.

15:57.001 --> 15:58.834
I JUST HOPE WE
FIND HIM SOON.

15:58.835 --> 16:01.703
REMEMBER WHAT THAT STUFF
DID TO THAT GARBAGE CAN.

16:01.704 --> 16:04.038
BINGO!
I'VE LOCATED HIM.

16:04.039 --> 16:06.340
HIS TRACKS LEAD
INTO THE PARK.

16:08.676 --> 16:10.678
LET'S GO, TURTLES.

16:12.347 --> 16:16.182
ALL RIGHT. WAIT HERE
TILL I CHECK IT OUT.

16:17.750 --> 16:19.651
ALL CLEAR.
COME ON UP.

16:21.853 --> 16:23.921
NOW WHAT, BEBOP?

16:23.922 --> 16:26.355
NOW WHAT, ROCK STEADY?

16:26.356 --> 16:29.859
NOW WHAT...OH.
I FORGOT.

16:29.860 --> 16:32.527
THE BOSS AIN'T HERE.

16:32.528 --> 16:35.297
MAYBE WE GET
THE ELECTRONIC STUFF.

16:35.298 --> 16:38.199
I'VE GOT TO FIND A RADIO
TO WARN THE AUTHORITIES.

16:39.467 --> 16:40.934
AH! THERE'S ONE.

16:43.271 --> 16:46.505
HELLO. HELLO.
IS ANYONE OUT THERE?

16:46.506 --> 16:50.508
OH, BOY, LOOK AT
ALL THESE LEVERS
AND BUTTONS AND STUFF.

16:50.509 --> 16:53.077
I WONDER HOW THIS WORKS.

16:54.879 --> 16:57.014
KEEP IT COMING.

16:57.015 --> 16:58.415
STEADY, STEADY.

16:58.416 --> 17:00.416
HEY, WAIT A MINUTE.

17:00.417 --> 17:03.318
DROP ME.
DROP ME!

17:03.319 --> 17:06.887
NO, DON'T DROP ME.
DON'T DROP ME!

17:09.656 --> 17:12.291
COME IN,
ANYONE--

17:12.292 --> 17:15.295
ANYONE BUT YOU,
THAT IS.

17:15.296 --> 17:18.696
WAIT.
DON'T I KNOW YOU?

17:18.698 --> 17:22.233
I DON'T THINK SO.
GOT TO GO.

17:22.233 --> 17:24.734
IT'S THAT REPORTER
DAME, APRIL O'NEILL.

17:24.736 --> 17:26.236
GRAB HER!

17:26.237 --> 17:29.172
HANG ON, APRIL.
HERE I COME.

17:29.173 --> 17:33.175
YOU MIGHT BE TARZAN,
BUT I'M NOT JANE.

17:33.176 --> 17:36.444
MICHELANGELO,
YOU'RE A TURTLE AGAIN.

17:36.445 --> 17:38.412
LET'S HOPE IT LASTS
THIS TIME.

17:40.315 --> 17:43.317
UPSY-DAISY,
HORNHEAD.

17:44.485 --> 17:48.721
OH, MONDO BUMMER.
I'M CHANGING AGAIN.

17:48.722 --> 17:53.257
I JUST WISH MY BODY
WOULD MAKE UP ITS MIND.

17:53.258 --> 17:56.493
HEY! LOOK WHAT WE GOT--
A HUMAN TURTLE.

17:56.494 --> 17:58.460
LOOKS LIKE SOMEBODY'S
BEEN NIBBLING

17:58.461 --> 18:01.264
MOTHER SHREDDER'S
COOKIES.

18:01.265 --> 18:04.933
LET ME GO, DUDE,
AND I PROMISE
NOT TO HURT YOU.

18:04.934 --> 18:06.935
BIG TALK FOR A GUY

18:06.936 --> 18:09.303
THAT JUST LOST
HIS TURTLE POWERS.

18:11.106 --> 18:13.573
HAUL HIM AWAY, BEBOP.

18:13.574 --> 18:16.443
YOU EX-TURTLES ARE
GOING TO BE EXTINCT.

18:18.077 --> 18:20.513
DON'T COUNT ON IT,
BOULDER-BRAIN.

18:23.282 --> 18:26.450
TURTLES
FIGHT WITH HONOR!

18:26.451 --> 18:28.418
WAY TO GO, TURTLES!

18:28.419 --> 18:32.721
PUT ME DOWN,
YOU MUSCLE-BOUND MUTANT.

18:32.722 --> 18:35.390
OH, HAPPY TO OBLIGE,

18:35.391 --> 18:37.626
WHEN WE GET
A LITTLE BIT HIGHER.

18:37.627 --> 18:40.694
HANG ON, APRIL.
HERE I COME.

18:40.695 --> 18:43.030
I DON'T KNOW
WHERE YOU CAME FROM,

18:43.031 --> 18:45.231
BUT YOU'RE GONNA WISH
YOU NEVER LEFT.

18:45.232 --> 18:47.633
I BET YOU SAY THAT
TO ALL THE TURTLES.

18:52.105 --> 18:53.172
DON'T YOU FELLAS KNOW

18:53.173 --> 18:55.273
I NEVER WORK
WITHOUT A NET.

18:55.274 --> 18:59.242
I THINK YOU'LL AGREE
THIS IS REAL SLICK.

18:59.243 --> 19:02.312
WHOA!
WHOA!

19:04.748 --> 19:07.216
MAYBE A BATH WILL HELP YOU
CLEAN UP YOUR ACT.

19:07.217 --> 19:09.751
EH...YOU'RE GOING
TO GET IT, TURTLE.

19:09.752 --> 19:11.786
YOU ARE.

19:19.425 --> 19:20.792
THIS DON'T LOOK GOOD.

19:20.793 --> 19:23.461
I'M
GETTING OUT OF HERE.

19:23.462 --> 19:28.432
GIVE UP, TURTLES,
OR I DROP
YOUR SNOOPY FRIEND.

19:28.433 --> 19:30.000
DON'T LISTEN TO HIM, GUYS...

19:30.001 --> 19:31.800
HE'S BLUFFING...

19:31.801 --> 19:33.802
I HOPE.

19:33.803 --> 19:37.438
I RECKON I'LL JUST
LASSO ME A LITTLE HEIFER.

19:41.410 --> 19:46.746
I NEED SOME TOTAL
TURTLE POWER.

19:46.747 --> 19:47.747
OH, GET REAL!

19:47.748 --> 19:50.416
YOU'RE JUST
A PUNY HUMAN NOW.

19:51.651 --> 19:55.686
SO AM I, BUT THAT
DOESN'T STOP ME.

19:59.190 --> 20:01.524
WELL, WHAT DO YOU KNOW.
A FLYING RHINO.

20:03.693 --> 20:06.028
ONE DOWN,
ONE TO GO.

20:12.633 --> 20:15.702
CAN'T THOSE GUYS
EVER JUST LEAVE
THROUGH THE DOOR?

20:17.304 --> 20:19.872
HOLD STILL WHILE
I SPRAY YOU WITH
THE ANTIDOTE.

20:21.174 --> 20:23.442
I'M CHANGING BACK!

20:23.443 --> 20:26.610
ONLY THIS TIME,
IT'S PERMANENT.

20:26.611 --> 20:29.547
ALL RIGHT!
I'M YOURS TRULY AGAIN.

20:29.548 --> 20:31.981
HEY,
MICHELANGELO!

20:31.982 --> 20:33.550
HOW YOU DOIN',
BUDDY?

20:33.551 --> 20:36.719
TURTLE OR HUMAN,
I STILL THINK
YOU'RE THE GREATEST.

20:39.155 --> 20:40.021
CAREFUL, APRIL.

20:40.022 --> 20:42.323
YOU MIGHT TURN HIM
HUMAN AGAIN.

20:42.324 --> 20:45.859
NO WAY, DUDE.
I'M PACKING SHELL.

20:45.860 --> 20:48.728
BEING HUMAN
IS TOTALLY BOGUS.

20:49.963 --> 20:51.364
NOT A BAD STORY,
APRIL.

20:51.365 --> 20:54.399
NOT A BAD STORY
AT ALL...

20:54.400 --> 20:56.434
THIS PART ABOUT THE GANG
ROBBING A SHIP--

20:56.435 --> 20:58.235
THAT'S GOOD-GOOD-GOOD
STUFF...

20:58.236 --> 20:59.669
THANKS, CHIEF.

20:59.670 --> 21:02.206
BUT WHO'D
BELIEVE THIS BUNK

21:02.207 --> 21:03.639
ABOUT TEENAGE TURTLES

21:03.640 --> 21:07.210
MOPPING UP THE DECK
WITH HUMAN GANGSTERS?

21:07.211 --> 21:10.712
NEXT TIME, JUST
STICK TO THE FACTS.

21:10.713 --> 21:12.879
RIGHT, CHIEF.

21:12.880 --> 21:17.484
I CAN HARDLY WAIT
FOR THIS TUBULAR
PIZZA, DUDES.

21:17.485 --> 21:18.818
I KNOW YOU'LL LIKE IT.

21:18.819 --> 21:20.353
RIGHT--WE MADE IT
IN HONOR

21:20.354 --> 21:22.354
OF YOUR RETURN
TO TURTLEHOOD...

21:22.355 --> 21:25.291
AND ALSO A MEMENTO
OF YOUR ADVENTURES
AS A HUMAN.

21:25.292 --> 21:28.059
A CHOCOLATE CHIP
PIZZA.

21:29.528 --> 21:32.195
CHOCOLATE CHIP
PIZZA?

21:32.196 --> 21:33.830
I THINK
IT'LL BE A WHILE

21:33.831 --> 21:37.199
BEFORE MICHELANGELO
GETS BACK HIS TASTE
FOR THOSE THINGS.

21:37.200 --> 21:38.600
SHOULD WE SAVE HIM
A SLICE?
