18:11.800 --> 18:13.134
I walked up to them because

18:13.176 --> 18:14.844
we had to return
the fucking float,

18:14.886 --> 18:16.554
and then Haley snapped at me,

18:16.596 --> 18:17.680
which I was like pissy
about because

18:17.722 --> 18:19.265
- Did she really?
- that's the second time.

18:19.307 --> 18:21.017
Yeah. I was just like,
"Bro, we need to end this."

18:21.059 --> 18:23.978
Yeah. I feel like Brianna
and Haley do blow up, sometimes

18:24.020 --> 18:25.605
but I paid a little bit of
attention to her at Pride

18:25.647 --> 18:28.483
and they were dancing and
doing their own thing.

18:28.525 --> 18:30.819
I'm completely loyal to

18:30.860 --> 18:33.238
Brianna and Haley
over Summer and Marissa.

18:33.279 --> 18:34.906
They are my best friends.

18:34.948 --> 18:36.783
I'm loyal to them, but
that doesn't mean I hate

18:36.825 --> 18:39.285
Summer and Marissa or have
and like ill will towards them.

18:39.327 --> 18:41.538
I know Mack feels
the same way that I do

18:41.579 --> 18:43.873
so it just sucks that
there's this like weird divide

18:43.915 --> 18:46.125
in our friend group
and there's sides,

18:46.167 --> 18:47.794
but I'm always going to go with

18:47.836 --> 18:50.088
Brianna and Haley over
Summer and Marissa.

18:50.129 --> 18:52.423
I'm just going to be cautious

18:52.465 --> 18:54.259

used to being cautious,

with my friendships.

18:55.343 --> 18:56.886
Yeah.

18:56.928 --> 18:58.471
With all this drama
between Summer and Marissa

18:58.513 --> 19:00.139
and Haley and Brianna,
I'm obviously choosing

19:00.181 --> 19:01.933
Summer and Marissa because
I'm closest to them.

19:01.975 --> 19:03.935
Nelly, Ali, and Jordan
have made it clear

19:03.977 --> 19:06.020
that they're all on
team Summer and Marissa,

19:06.062 --> 19:07.772

thinking that Shiva and Mel

19:07.814 --> 19:08.982
are on the same side, too.

19:09.023 --> 19:10.817
I hate picking sides,

19:10.859 --> 19:13.945
but I'm not going to not be
friends with Haley and Brianna,

19:13.987 --> 19:16.823

lines have been drawn.

26:33.050 --> 26:34.510
- Okay.
- Okay.

26:34.552 --> 26:37.138
And you're going on this
little picnic. Okay.

26:37.179 --> 26:39.598
I'm trying to plan a surprise

26:39.640 --> 26:41.976
where Summers'
best friend shows up,

26:42.018 --> 26:43.102
and her family shows up,

26:43.144 --> 26:44.645
and she's not expecting it.

26:44.687 --> 26:47.273
But the problem is that
Summer is inspector gadget

26:47.315 --> 26:49.567
when it comes to anything
in my life.

26:49.608 --> 26:51.235
- Hey, baby.

26:51.277 --> 26:52.695
- You look so beautiful, baby.

26:52.737 --> 26:53.821
- Thank you.
- Yes.

26:53.863 --> 26:57.283
- I wore a dress!
- You ready to go?

26:57.325 --> 26:58.492
- Did you get lipstick on me?

26:58.534 --> 27:01.454
- Yes.
- Okay.

27:01.495 --> 27:02.997
It's one of the most
endearing things about her

27:03.039 --> 27:04.874
is that she knows
everything about me,

27:04.915 --> 27:06.375
but at the same
time, it makes it

27:06.417 --> 27:08.377
extremely difficult
to plan a surprise,

27:08.419 --> 27:11.589
because I care about
her so much that this

27:11.630 --> 27:16.010
is the most meaningful thing
to me thus far in my life.

27:16.052 --> 27:19.096
So obviously I'm going to be
an anxious mess

27:19.138 --> 27:21.849
and I think she's picking
up on that.

27:21.891 --> 27:23.601
- Look at her.
She's nervous as heck.

36:11.795 --> 36:13.547
I never thought I'd be able
to kiss my girlfriend

36:13.589 --> 36:15.966
in front of them and to
feel comfortable doing so,

36:16.008 --> 36:18.093
and to feel that
it was genuine,

36:18.135 --> 36:20.137
they were there for us,
not just me,

36:20.178 --> 36:21.305
they weren't just like,
"This is my daughter.

36:21.346 --> 36:22.681
I have to accept this."

36:22.723 --> 36:24.224
You're their daughter
to them too.

a big lifetime event,

and congratulate them later.

36:37.905 --> 36:42.326
It's a very special
moment between her and Marissa

36:42.367 --> 36:45.537
and it should be shared with
her closest friends and family,

36:45.579 --> 36:48.040

invited to the wedding.

the hottest girl ever.

energy at the same time.

37:53.355 --> 37:55.232
the weird energy from
Summer, Marissa, and stuff.

to that shit.

You just let things bother
you more easily than we do.

got engaged, I think.

38:14.418 --> 38:16.294
- Yeah, good for them.
- Yeah, I think so.

38:16.336 --> 38:18.672
They got nothing else going
on so it's something, right?

38:18.714 --> 38:20.215
Yeah. I think Mel
told me that they had

38:20.257 --> 38:22.217
a pretty engagement
on the beach or something.

38:22.259 --> 38:24.511
Honestly, though
I know it's crazy

for a short amount of time,

marry Amanda.

Like dead ass,
I would marry her.

in years from now?

38:34.229 --> 38:35.939
I mean, honestly, I would
do it tomorrow.

I'm not going to lie,

38:46.783 --> 38:47.993
I'm a little bit jealous
that Olivia

38:48.035 --> 38:49.661

after two months

38:49.703 --> 38:51.663
and that she's ready to
take the steps

38:51.705 --> 38:52.956

38:52.998 --> 38:54.833
it kind of makes me
feel like crap

38:54.875 --> 38:58.295
when me and Brianna haven't
even like agreed on that yet.

38:58.336 --> 38:59.755

- You're a changed person.

38:59.796 --> 39:01.506

that's how I felt.

As soon as I met her, I knew
I always wanted to be with her,

39:02.758 --> 39:04.384

it's not that I don't
want to get married.

everything for you.

39:13.602 --> 39:15.187

39:15.228 --> 39:17.189
- You would never find another
beautiful girl like her.

39:17.230 --> 39:20.025
I could just hire a
hairdresser and a makeup artist.

39:20.067 --> 39:23.153

psycho?

39:23.195 --> 39:23.945

anything these days.

39:23.987 --> 39:25.405

I need hair and makeup,

39:36.750 --> 39:38.460
I got to hire somebody.

39:38.502 --> 39:40.921

to live without you, she could.

39:40.962 --> 39:44.049

independent person.

39:44.091 --> 39:45.550

we thought

this was going
to fucking happen.

40:34.099 --> 40:35.809
Summer and I have been
texting about this shit.

40:35.851 --> 40:37.227
We were just like waiting
for it to happen

40:37.269 --> 40:39.146

acting super creepy.

40:39.187 --> 40:41.314
I'm so excited for them.

40:41.356 --> 40:43.316
I think that they're honestly
perfect for each other.

40:43.358 --> 40:45.861
Like, I dated Marissa and
like, I just like, know her,

40:45.902 --> 40:48.196
and I thought since
the day that I met Summer

40:48.238 --> 40:50.699
that they were just
right for each other.

40:50.740 --> 40:54.202
I'm feeling real
single right now.

40:54.244 --> 40:56.913

40:58.540 --> 41:02.043

- And where? And where?

41:02.085 --> 41:04.171

Where are we going?

41:06.590 --> 41:08.175

to go somewhere. Anywhere.

the invites? Like, people wise?

41:12.971 --> 41:14.055

41:15.098 --> 41:16.766

41:16.808 --> 41:18.476
It's so crazy. I feel like

we were all like this big group
and now it's like split.

41:23.231 --> 41:24.941

that the older we get,

41:24.983 --> 41:26.401
we all have so much
going on in our lives

41:26.443 --> 41:27.986
that we don't have time
to even be friends

41:28.028 --> 41:29.821
with that many people on

41:29.863 --> 41:31.489
a serious level to be
good friends anyway.

41:31.531 --> 41:32.490
- We try to be chill
with everybody

41:32.532 --> 41:34.159
because if I see you out,
like when

41:34.201 --> 41:36.453
I'm out, I want everything to be
cordial and shit.

41:36.494 --> 41:37.871
But like it comes to the point
in time like,

41:37.913 --> 41:40.373
- I don't have to be your
friend.
- Yeah.

41:40.415 --> 41:42.000
- It's not a big deal
and don't be offended.

41:42.042 --> 41:44.211
It's okay. You don't
have to like, like everybody.

41:44.252 --> 41:45.545
Everyone doesn't have to
to like me.

I don't know where things
will go from here,

41:52.052 --> 41:53.887
but what I do know
is things have changed.

41:53.929 --> 41:55.764
I think that everybody just
needs to mature

41:55.805 --> 41:56.973
a little bit on that end, not
ours.

41:57.015 --> 41:59.059
The Tampa scene
is really small,

all run into each other.

42:00.185 --> 42:01.519
We'll see how that goes.

42:01.561 --> 42:03.521
Will I smack the fuck
out of somebody?

42:03.563 --> 42:05.106
Maybe.

42:11.863 --> 42:14.991
I'm going to do a large
butterscotch Sundae.

42:15.033 --> 42:20.121

coffee milkshake?

42:20.163 --> 42:23.333

a normal size.

42:23.375 --> 42:25.168

cream is about to.

have a chill day.

42:35.929 --> 42:37.264

to a point that I never
thought it would get to.

42:45.146 --> 42:47.148
Life is too short, like
at this point,

42:47.190 --> 42:48.692
my ice cream is melting but...

42:48.733 --> 42:50.151

I'm kind of concerned
that it might not

And, I think she should know
that she could lose me forever
