Next time, seriously,

08:12.161 --> 08:13.963
she hurts you,
I hurt her. No doubt.

08:19.608 --> 08:22.642
Dude, I could not give a shit
about her.

08:25.647 --> 08:26.580
Okay.

08:29.783 --> 08:31.178
So, he picked Stanford?

08:31.917 --> 08:32.816
-Mm-hmm.
-Dick.

08:33.185 --> 08:35.820
Why... Why... Why not Brown?
It's like an hour away, right?

08:35.855 --> 08:37.052
His dad went to Stanford.

08:39.056 --> 08:41.254
We got in a huge,

08:42.323 --> 08:44.895
-huge fight.
-Oh, I heard.

08:44.930 --> 08:46.897
-Are you serious?
-Yeah. I mean,

08:46.932 --> 08:48.360
everyone on
the third floor heard.

08:48.395 --> 08:49.933
-Fuck.
-Yeah.

08:49.968 --> 08:51.671
-Shit.
-You two never fight.

08:51.706 --> 08:52.837
Yeah, I know.

08:57.338 --> 09:00.075
He's coming over tonight, later.

09:03.311 --> 09:05.916
-Well, you look like shit.

09:08.118 --> 09:12.054
Oh, you do. Sorry.
Go to sleep.

09:12.089 --> 09:13.088
Bye, honey.

09:13.523 --> 09:15.288
Wait,
text me if he calls.

09:16.126 --> 09:18.060
Aw. Thank you.

09:20.130 --> 09:21.063
Tara!

11:18.314 --> 11:19.753
-I'm home.

11:19.955 --> 11:21.121
Oh, you got him. Great.

11:21.156 --> 11:23.020
-Whoa, whoa, whoa.
-Tara, check the baby.

11:23.055 --> 11:24.252
Can you
get him for me this time?

11:24.287 --> 11:25.990
-No.
-Why not?

11:26.025 --> 11:28.025
-'Cause it's your turn.

11:28.060 --> 11:29.026
Please.
I'll give you five bucks.

11:29.061 --> 11:31.864
-I don't care.
-I'll give you ten bucks.

11:31.899 --> 11:33.899
-I don't care.

11:44.846 --> 11:46.505
-I'm here.

11:47.343 --> 11:48.276
You're good.

11:49.279 --> 11:51.378
Yeah. You're good.

-Hurt who?
-<i> Nothing.</i>

12:11.070 --> 12:14.137
<i>-No-- Nothing, Mom.</i>

12:14.606 --> 12:17.470
Well, if he's hungry, you can
just bring him down. Okay?

12:17.505 --> 12:19.472
<i> He's not hungry.</i>
<i>He just needs a change.</i>

12:20.775 --> 12:24.510

12:51.341 --> 12:53.847
Let's say there was a big fight.

12:55.114 --> 12:57.884
Something not even
a dozen roses could fix.

13:00.416 --> 13:01.921
Where did you get that?

13:04.255 --> 13:05.958
The more we know,
the more we can help.

13:10.162 --> 13:11.260
The babysitter.

13:13.396 --> 13:16.001
I sent texts. I'm no molester.

13:17.136 --> 13:18.498
What's the babysitter's name?

13:21.173 --> 13:22.172
Tara Haldon.

13:23.175 --> 13:24.306
Thanks for your time.

13:40.929 --> 13:42.027
Mm. Go on.

13:49.069 --> 13:50.464
I need the car this weekend.

13:52.336 --> 13:54.633
Me and Suzy
are gonna be babysitting again.

13:54.668 --> 13:55.767
Not for that Gina Loeb.

13:55.803 --> 13:57.504
You know I don't want you
going over there anymore.

13:57.539 --> 13:59.077
Mom, I told you I'm not.

13:59.112 --> 14:00.881
I'm not babysitting
for them anymore.

14:06.053 --> 14:09.351
What happens when I'm driving,
and we have one car?

14:09.386 --> 14:11.485
I don't know what went on
with you and Gina, but, um,

14:11.520 --> 14:12.893
what's her husband's name again?

14:19.198 --> 14:20.098
Mikhail.

14:21.728 --> 14:22.661
Yeah.

14:23.196 --> 14:25.037
He's got a tree
he needs cut down.

14:25.072 --> 14:27.006
Now can I take the job, or, uh,

14:27.041 --> 14:28.909
I'll be violating
some family feud?

14:33.278 --> 14:36.312
That car will be a total P-O-S
when I get to it.

14:36.347 --> 14:40.283
Listen. You start saving now,
you can buy a car.

14:40.318 --> 14:43.088
When I was 16,
I bought my own car.

14:43.123 --> 14:45.486
And no P-O-S.

14:45.521 --> 14:48.159
I said P-O-S,
that's not a curse.

14:50.295 --> 14:51.657
Actually, you know what, Ben?

14:52.059 --> 14:53.560
You should charge
the Loebs double.

14:53.595 --> 14:55.166
They're a bunch of
rich stuck-ups.

14:55.835 --> 14:58.400
I heard that Gina Loeb...

14:58.435 --> 15:00.666
...spent a thousand dollars

15:00.701 --> 15:03.075
on a baby stroller
made of some sort of,

15:03.110 --> 15:05.176
-I don't know, special steel.

15:05.211 --> 15:06.375
It's a step up from
the wheelbarrow

15:06.410 --> 15:07.640
you guys used for us.

15:07.675 --> 15:09.675
Nah. No need for a wheelbarrow.

15:09.710 --> 15:12.183
We locked you in your closet
till you were six.

15:12.218 --> 15:15.021
-Like Aunt Diane.

15:17.124 --> 15:18.288
You had to go there?

15:22.690 --> 15:24.327
Listen, that's my sister...

15:26.727 --> 15:30.135
and I've been thinking,
you know, it's been, um,

15:30.570 --> 15:33.204
six months,
and I think we should all...

15:34.273 --> 15:35.371
maybe take a trip up there

15:35.406 --> 15:37.043
-on Saturday.
-Sorry, Mom.

15:37.545 --> 15:39.672
Remember Boy Scout project?

15:39.707 --> 15:41.410
I got a job in Worcester.

15:42.747 --> 15:46.019
Really, it won't take that long.
I know you hate going, but...

15:48.485 --> 15:51.420
I mean, she's family. It's...
It's the right thing to do.

16:08.604 --> 16:11.176
You can say "piece of shit."
I think you're old enough now.

16:18.449 --> 16:20.218
<i> So, you have to</i>
<i>go to the prison?</i>

16:20.253 --> 16:22.253
No,
we're going to the psych ward.

16:23.487 --> 16:25.355
Mom's gonna be hysterical
the whole time.

16:25.390 --> 16:26.488
It's fucking annoying.

16:27.491 --> 16:28.688
Okay. Well, do you want company?

16:28.723 --> 16:30.327
<i>You'd do that for me?</i>

16:30.362 --> 16:32.230
Yeah. Sure, sure. Besides...
...obviously,

16:32.265 --> 16:33.631
it kind of sounds
like a Lifetime Movie.

16:33.667 --> 16:36.663
Like<i> My Killer Aunt</i> starring
Jennifer Love Hewitt.

16:36.698 --> 16:39.204
-Fuck you.

16:41.142 --> 16:42.273
Yeah?

16:42.308 --> 16:44.407
Carl is downstairs.
Yes? No?

16:45.109 --> 16:47.278
Well, take me with you.
I'll be your voice of reason.

16:47.313 --> 16:48.741
<i>Your Wi-Fi Jiminy Cricket.</i>

16:48.776 --> 16:51.480
Let me
think about that for a second.

16:54.386 --> 16:55.152
No.

16:55.187 --> 16:56.815
My... My advice is just
ditch him.

16:56.850 --> 16:59.092
-No.
-No. He's... He's a lost cause

16:59.127 --> 17:00.489
-'cause he doesn't--
-Bye.

17:02.724 --> 17:03.723
Love you.

17:16.474 --> 17:17.273
-Oh, hey.
-Hey.

17:17.575 --> 17:20.080
Um. Hang on.
Um. Carl going away to Stanford.

17:20.515 --> 17:22.544
He hasn't done this to hurt you,
you know.

17:22.579 --> 17:23.411
Yeah, well.

17:23.847 --> 17:24.880
And... And... And I don't wanna
give you a bunch of bullshit

17:25.148 --> 17:28.550
about absence making the heart
grow fonder because it doesn't.

17:28.585 --> 17:30.288
It sucks and it hurts like hell,
but, uh--

17:30.323 --> 17:32.587
Oh, great. Do you also go to
the orphanages on Father's Day

17:32.622 --> 17:35.689
-and laugh at kids?
-But absence also clarifies,

17:36.258 --> 17:39.198
it validates, it tells you
whether it's love or not.

17:40.366 --> 17:41.530
And then if it is...

17:42.165 --> 17:45.666
Stanford, Japan, the Moon,
none of that matters.

17:45.701 --> 17:46.400
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

17:46.669 --> 17:49.604
Your mom told me about...
uh, Pigtails.

17:50.106 --> 17:51.738
-I don't wanna talk about that.
-You just let me know

17:51.773 --> 17:53.443
if I should talk to her parents.

17:54.112 --> 17:55.808
No. I don't want you
to talk to them.

17:56.477 --> 17:59.647
I'm not gonna let
anyone hurt you... ever.

18:03.290 --> 18:04.022
Okay.

18:04.525 --> 18:06.489
-I can take care of myself.

18:28.645 --> 18:31.349
-You all right?

18:31.951 --> 18:33.681
Hey, what are you
doing this weekend?

18:34.915 --> 18:36.552
Oh, my God.
Monday's Columbus Day.

18:36.587 --> 18:37.817
Yeah, yeah.

18:39.020 --> 18:43.295
No, I was thinking maybe
if Suzy could cover for us...

18:44.064 --> 18:46.364
we can get away
like we did last--

18:46.399 --> 18:47.926
What? You don't like that idea?

18:47.961 --> 18:49.565
-No. I love that idea.
-Yeah?

18:49.600 --> 18:51.435
-I'd love to do that.
-Mm.

19:02.712 --> 19:04.580
What?
Why are you looking like that?

19:08.421 --> 19:09.816
You sure you wanna
go to Stanford?

19:09.851 --> 19:11.257
Oh, my God.

19:15.461 --> 19:16.493
No.

19:18.299 --> 19:20.431
-Why? What are you about to do?
-How about now?

19:22.732 --> 19:23.731
Mm.

19:25.471 --> 19:26.965
-I said...
-Mm.

19:27.000 --> 19:27.966
Yeah.

19:34.579 --> 19:35.644
How 'bout now?

19:43.324 --> 19:44.983
-Why did you stop?
-What the fuck?

19:45.018 --> 19:46.688
-What?
-Wait.

19:46.723 --> 19:48.987
-Someone's in my room.
-What you mean?

19:49.022 --> 19:50.527
Someone's in my room.

19:50.562 --> 19:52.023
-Hey, Tara, wait.
-What?

19:52.058 --> 19:53.464
-Aren't we celebrating?
-Yes.

19:53.499 --> 19:54.597
Wait. Come here.

19:56.201 --> 19:58.865
Oh, my God. You don't get it.

19:58.900 --> 20:01.406
-You'll never be--

20:03.377 --> 20:05.707
Fucking hell.
What are you doing?

20:24.398 --> 20:25.859
Can you stay out of my room?

20:26.361 --> 20:28.367
I don't ask for much.
That's all that I ask.

20:28.402 --> 20:30.666
In return, I'll get
straight A's, I won't get high,

20:30.701 --> 20:32.965
and I'll never have to Google
the word chlamydia. Okay?

20:33.935 --> 20:35.407
Stop going in my room.

20:42.009 --> 20:44.009
I don't know. You deal with it.

20:50.985 --> 20:55.020
We are at Defcon Four.
I repeat, we are at Defcon Four.

21:02.062 --> 21:03.468
Not good with Carl?

21:05.868 --> 21:08.539
No, Mom. Actually, things were
really great with Carl.

21:09.008 --> 21:11.003
Why do you just assume
things are bad?

21:11.572 --> 21:13.313
I'm just really annoyed...

21:15.977 --> 21:17.746
because someone keeps on
coming in my room

21:17.781 --> 21:18.780
and touching my stuff.

21:19.582 --> 21:22.454
Every single day, something of
mine is either moved or missing.

21:22.489 --> 21:23.389
No one's...

21:24.821 --> 21:26.557
I mean,
no one's coming in your room.

21:26.592 --> 21:28.427
Yeah, I know.
No one's coming in my room

21:28.462 --> 21:30.462
and I'm just going
fucking crazy, right?

21:33.060 --> 21:35.060
If so, then... why?

21:35.095 --> 21:38.030
I'm the happiest
that I've ever been.

21:38.532 --> 21:42.441
I have my coach, my teammates,
Carl, they all like me.

21:42.476 --> 21:43.640
I'm doing a great job.

21:44.808 --> 21:45.906
How about your dreams?

21:49.780 --> 21:51.813
-What?
-It's just that's how
it... it...

21:52.915 --> 21:54.420
it started with...

21:55.753 --> 21:58.050
Diane, nightmares. And,

21:58.485 --> 22:00.756
you know,
the whole time she was happy.

22:00.791 --> 22:02.120
-She was so happy.
-I'm...

22:02.991 --> 22:04.562
not her.

22:04.597 --> 22:06.564
And I'm not saying
you are. It's just...

22:07.160 --> 22:08.060
it's just that--

22:08.562 --> 22:11.404
it was just that
she was 16 when it started,

22:11.439 --> 22:13.032
and you're a year older, and...

22:14.167 --> 22:15.672
it's just a family history.

22:15.707 --> 22:17.036
You mean
the Borden family curse?

22:18.644 --> 22:20.644
The nursery rhyme...

22:20.679 --> 22:22.008
is part of our family history.

22:22.043 --> 22:24.714
You know,
mental illness, it's... it's...

22:25.216 --> 22:27.684
-it's not a curse.
-No, it's not a curse.

22:27.719 --> 22:30.819
-It's... It's a blessing.
-I'm just saying that there...

22:30.854 --> 22:32.854
there are things
that you can do.

22:32.889 --> 22:35.021
There's medication.

22:35.056 --> 22:36.495
I'm not gonna do medication.

22:39.093 --> 22:40.433
Why would you say that?

22:41.062 --> 22:42.094
I'm not crazy.

22:44.472 --> 22:45.636
Honey, I'm on your team.

22:50.137 --> 22:51.675
So, here's what we're gonna do.

22:51.710 --> 22:54.810
Let's just start with seeing
Dr. Sanchez tomorrow

22:54.845 --> 22:56.944
at- 30 after practice.

22:57.914 --> 22:59.650
I'm fine.

23:00.983 --> 23:04.457
I'm honestly fine.
I'm just tired because I just...

23:05.193 --> 23:06.822
...
I haven't been
sleeping that much

23:06.857 --> 23:08.219
because, you know,
I've been sewing all night

23:08.254 --> 23:10.188
since Grandma sent
the trunk of clothes. That's it.

23:10.223 --> 23:11.992
Let's just see
what the therapist has to say.

23:12.830 --> 23:14.797
Okay? What do you think?

23:17.604 --> 23:18.900
Will you please
get out of my room now?

23:21.773 --> 23:22.739
Yeah.

23:23.907 --> 23:24.840
Yeah.

23:27.515 --> 23:28.745
Will you please
get out of my room?

23:28.780 --> 23:29.977
I'm just gonna say I think you--

23:30.012 --> 23:31.517
Please just
leave me alone right now?

23:32.119 --> 23:33.552
Please. Just give me a second.

23:33.587 --> 23:34.817
I just think
you're very talented.

23:38.053 --> 23:39.492
Please get out
of my room.

26:42.138 --> 26:43.269
<i> Tara...</i>

26:56.955 --> 26:58.020
<i> Tara...</i>

27:11.101 --> 27:14.234
-You're not real.
-<i> Sure I am.</i>

27:15.303 --> 27:16.335
You're not real.

27:18.306 --> 27:20.306
No.

27:20.341 --> 27:22.913
You're not real.
You're not real.

27:22.948 --> 27:24.079
You're not real.

28:03.087 --> 28:04.416
If it isn't real...

28:06.486 --> 28:09.256
bring it down
on your brother's head.

28:36.351 --> 28:38.516
Your aunt wasn't afraid.

28:42.423 --> 28:44.423
Therapy
isn't enough, you know that.

28:44.458 --> 28:46.029
Didn't work with Diane,
why would it work--

28:46.064 --> 28:47.261
Do not
bring up my sister.

28:47.296 --> 28:49.197
How dare you bring up
my sister like that?

28:49.232 --> 28:50.869
I'm trying to save her, too.

28:50.904 --> 28:52.332
I will just go ahead
and have a drink.

28:55.238 --> 28:56.303
Honey, is that you?

29:11.485 --> 29:13.221
-<i> Tara.</i>

29:16.358 --> 29:19.898
-<i> Tara...</i>

29:29.470 --> 29:30.535
-Tara?

29:30.570 --> 29:31.470
Yeah?

29:32.880 --> 29:33.879
You're late.

29:34.581 --> 29:37.080
-Gotta go. Come on.
-Okay. Just a minute.

29:37.115 --> 29:39.082
Tara,
I am not driving you again.

29:39.117 --> 29:41.150
Okay. You don't have to.
Just one second.

30:04.175 --> 30:05.174
I'm not crazy.

30:07.673 --> 30:08.881
Tara...

30:12.282 --> 30:13.952
you having a good day?

30:13.987 --> 30:16.020
-No diploma.

30:16.555 --> 30:17.956
Where'd you go? Online?

30:19.322 --> 30:21.223
-Harvard.
-Hmm.

30:21.258 --> 30:23.896
And you?
Have you thought about college?

30:25.097 --> 30:26.492
Maybe fashion.

30:26.527 --> 30:28.593
I actually bought one of
your dresses from your mom.

30:28.628 --> 30:30.232
My dress pimp.

30:31.598 --> 30:34.940
She told me about
your aunt and family history.

30:35.976 --> 30:36.775
She's concerned.

30:37.144 --> 30:40.407
What? That I'm one step closer
on my way to crazy town?

30:41.542 --> 30:42.948
My family's curse?

30:50.419 --> 30:54.993
-And school?

30:56.656 --> 30:57.688
How are things going?

30:57.723 --> 30:59.129
What are you typing?

31:00.066 --> 31:01.032
Notes...

31:02.167 --> 31:03.529
so I can review them later.

31:05.665 --> 31:06.972
Just keep it off the cloud.

31:07.007 --> 31:08.908
I don't want someone
hacking you.

31:10.472 --> 31:13.110
Your computer, I mean.
Not with an axe.

31:18.513 --> 31:19.611
That was a joke.

31:24.123 --> 31:26.717
I understand that
you're going to see your aunt.

31:26.752 --> 31:28.026
Mm-hmm.

31:28.061 --> 31:29.357
Tell me about her.

31:29.392 --> 31:32.162
Well...

31:32.197 --> 31:35.198
...she suffocated her child
when she was 16 years old.

31:36.564 --> 31:39.004
And she's been
locked up ever since.

31:39.673 --> 31:42.469
She's the, uh,
winner of our family's

31:42.504 --> 31:44.108
"Black Sheep of the Year" award.

31:44.143 --> 31:46.407
Twenty years running, actually.

31:46.442 --> 31:47.980
You think it's humorous?

31:48.543 --> 31:50.048
No, I don't. I'm...

31:50.743 --> 31:51.676
not laughing.

31:53.251 --> 31:55.614
There is an infant in your home.

32:00.357 --> 32:02.522
I'm not saying
you're schizophrenic.

32:03.057 --> 32:04.656
You're just
a stressed-out high schooler...

32:04.691 --> 32:05.591
-...but,

32:06.160 --> 32:09.034
mid-teens is when
this disease first manifests.

32:09.803 --> 32:12.697
-And its prodromal stage--
-Prodromal stage?

32:13.502 --> 32:14.666
Are you serious?

32:16.439 --> 32:18.043
Beginning stage.

32:19.739 --> 32:24.247
You may feel a certain euphoria,
a sense of empowerment.

32:25.646 --> 32:27.151
Things seem clear to you.

32:28.418 --> 32:29.714
You feel amazing...

32:31.355 --> 32:34.620
and you can be prone
to fits of anger and violence,

32:35.255 --> 32:37.623
experience
multiple personalities...

32:39.363 --> 32:42.463
use different voices,
hear voices.

32:43.532 --> 32:46.731
But it can be held in check
with drugs and therapy.

32:46.766 --> 32:49.371
Mm-hmm.

32:54.114 --> 32:55.344
I would never hurt my family.

32:58.349 --> 33:00.217
Type that
in your fucking keyboard.

33:05.257 --> 33:06.520
<i> Tara...</i>

33:10.427 --> 33:11.624
<i>Tara...</i>

33:12.330 --> 33:13.263
You're fine.

33:14.365 --> 33:16.728
<i>Your aunt wasn't afraid.</i>

33:18.204 --> 33:19.170
Everything's fine.

33:24.441 --> 33:25.473
Tara Haldon?

33:27.411 --> 33:29.246
He sent me some texts and...

33:30.447 --> 33:31.479
and a photo.

33:32.614 --> 33:33.547
Mikhail?

33:35.485 --> 33:36.682
I make clothes.

33:37.584 --> 33:40.290
I sell my stuff on Etsy,
and he bought one of my pieces.

33:40.325 --> 33:42.721
And he told me he wanted me
to model it for him.

33:42.756 --> 33:44.789
And then came the dick pic.

33:44.824 --> 33:47.132
You do know
what he did was illegal.

33:47.167 --> 33:49.332
Yeah, you would have to arrest
half this town.

33:51.864 --> 33:54.337
-She knew.
-Gina?

33:54.372 --> 33:55.272
Mm-hmm.

33:56.473 --> 33:57.835
Anyone else?

33:58.637 --> 34:01.806
My mother. She knows about
the text, not the photo, though.

34:03.447 --> 34:05.183
And,
uh, just your mom?

34:06.318 --> 34:07.779
Yeah. My dad's...

34:09.453 --> 34:10.551
a little more protective,

34:10.586 --> 34:12.652
so I'd rather him
not know at all.

34:13.354 --> 34:16.227
Let's just stick
with the babysitting.

34:16.262 --> 34:18.625
I mean, you...
you kept doing it. Why?

34:19.027 --> 34:20.660
What? Are you saying I've
something to do with this?

34:20.895 --> 34:22.563
We're just doing
our due diligence.

34:24.171 --> 34:25.698
Hmm. Okay, are we done?

35:30.831 --> 35:31.929
You're going to Laurie's?

35:32.464 --> 35:34.503
Laurie kinda sucks.
I don't know.

35:34.538 --> 35:36.241
But I mean, maybe.

35:37.541 --> 35:38.540
You cutting through?

35:39.642 --> 35:40.608
Yeah.

35:42.007 --> 35:43.314
Text me if you go.

35:45.252 --> 35:46.350
-Bye.
-Bye.

36:46.577 --> 36:47.609
Hello?

36:49.008 --> 36:50.315
Is anyone there?

37:26.881 --> 37:29.387
Help! Help me!

37:35.956 --> 37:38.924
Help! Help me!

37:52.841 --> 37:53.972
Can you pass me the lace?

38:20.935 --> 38:22.066
I wish I sewed.

38:26.611 --> 38:27.511
Or anything.

38:31.077 --> 38:33.451
I mean, I don't do
the sports thing, or...

38:34.949 --> 38:36.355
the glee thing.

38:38.656 --> 38:39.589
Hmm.

38:40.526 --> 38:41.954
I know you would think you're...

38:43.958 --> 38:45.529
sewing stuff and...

38:46.895 --> 38:48.763
selling them. I don't know.
You just have like this,

38:49.098 --> 38:50.534
this real talent.

39:03.879 --> 39:04.878
You okay?

39:15.693 --> 39:17.022
I think I'm gonna
kill my family.

39:19.829 --> 39:21.664
You and every other teenager.

39:23.635 --> 39:24.832
<i> No, I'm for real.</i>

39:26.770 --> 39:30.035
<i>Don't say a word to anyone.</i>

39:30.939 --> 39:31.905
<i> Okay.</i>

39:41.983 --> 39:43.015
What's going on?

39:44.249 --> 39:45.688
I've dreamt about it.

39:47.725 --> 39:50.088
I thought things were
going good, great even, but...

39:54.567 --> 39:56.061
the nightmares I've
been having...

39:58.230 --> 39:59.438
I'm scared.

40:02.707 --> 40:05.103
<i>This nightmare,</i>
<i>I don't know. I just--</i>

40:05.138 --> 40:06.775
<i> I think you should</i>
<i>just stop worrying</i>

40:06.810 --> 40:09.107
<i>about your fucked-up family</i>
<i>and dreams.</i>

40:10.209 --> 40:11.208
<i> I know.</i>

40:12.849 --> 40:14.618
<i> You know what?</i>
<i>Besides, I think...</i>

40:15.587 --> 40:17.852
<i>every daughter wants to</i>
<i>kill their mother at</i>
<i>some point.</i>

40:19.185 --> 40:20.756
<i> Fucking tell me about it.</i>

40:22.056 --> 40:24.023
<i> Come here.</i>
<i>Come here, my love.</i>

40:32.770 --> 40:34.770
Hey, why are you up?

40:35.272 --> 40:37.971
My service project for
becoming a First Class Scout.

40:38.406 --> 40:40.039
Oh, yeah.
You're building something.

40:40.074 --> 40:41.777
What do you--
What are you building?

40:42.079 --> 40:43.515
Park benches.

40:44.243 --> 40:46.716
Okay. Jesus.

40:52.922 --> 40:54.790
What is it this time?

40:54.825 --> 40:56.121
God damnit. Please!

40:56.156 --> 40:57.793
"You're never home."

40:58.895 --> 41:00.598
"You don't help with the Jack."

41:01.997 --> 41:03.964
He's mad
she's not going to take them.

41:05.836 --> 41:07.836
Them? Is that us?

41:09.172 --> 41:11.642
Sounds like
we're with Dad in the divorce.

41:11.677 --> 41:12.808
Caleb, come on.

41:13.976 --> 41:14.876
Come on.

41:15.978 --> 41:18.176
Oh, yeah. Right...

41:19.113 --> 41:20.277
-today.
-Yeah.

41:23.051 --> 41:23.917
You better check
with your mother,

41:23.952 --> 41:25.656
I don't know
what the hell's going on.

41:26.525 --> 41:28.923
-Caleb, come on. Let's go.
-Wash it.

41:38.605 --> 41:39.736
He's running hot.

41:40.538 --> 41:42.266
Do you want me
to call a doctor?

41:42.301 --> 41:43.971
No, no, no. It's only 101.

41:45.777 --> 41:47.238
You're gonna be okay, right?

41:48.274 --> 41:50.681
My tough little monkey...

41:52.014 --> 41:54.179
-right, Jack?
-I like your hair.

41:54.214 --> 41:55.983
-What?
-I like your hair.

41:57.250 --> 41:58.150
Do you?

42:00.858 --> 42:01.989
It's very vintage.

42:04.796 --> 42:07.093
Well, that sounds old.

42:10.670 --> 42:13.671
Um, listen,
I want you to go ahead

42:13.706 --> 42:15.167
and go up
and see Aunt Diane today.

42:15.840 --> 42:16.839
What?

42:18.370 --> 42:19.842
Without you? I...

42:20.644 --> 42:22.647
I don't wanna go alone.
I don't even know her, Mom.

42:22.682 --> 42:25.375
You won't be alone.
You said that Suzy wanted to go.

42:25.410 --> 42:27.685
Yeah, she offered.
I'm not gonna actually

42:27.720 --> 42:30.083
-make her come with me--
-Jack has a fever.

42:32.824 --> 42:34.692
She already knows
that we're coming.

42:36.157 --> 42:38.091
I'm not gonna disappoint
that poor woman.

42:38.359 --> 42:40.093
Ma, she killed her kid.

42:40.128 --> 42:41.864
You don't know
what you're talking about.

42:42.566 --> 42:44.196
Yeah, I do. She's a murderer.

42:44.231 --> 42:46.902
You don't know
anything about that.

42:47.571 --> 42:49.740
Ma, I really don't wanna go.

42:50.710 --> 42:51.742
Oh, my God.

42:52.976 --> 42:54.943
Will you please
just do this for me?

42:55.412 --> 42:57.209
-Please?
-Okay, okay.

42:58.751 --> 43:01.279
-Why do I have to beg you?
-You're not. I'm going.

43:02.348 --> 43:04.084
And don't call her a murderer.

43:06.825 --> 43:07.824
She is a murderer.

43:08.693 --> 43:11.157
-Just saying it like it is.

43:20.003 --> 43:22.366
<i> Nice try.</i>
<i>We saw you.</i>

43:32.213 --> 43:33.344
How can I help you?

43:33.379 --> 43:35.918
As I understand it,
this was your...

43:35.953 --> 43:37.051
-Third.
-...third...

43:38.087 --> 43:40.054
altercation with Karen.

43:40.790 --> 43:42.859
It happens
in field hockey all the time.

43:42.894 --> 43:44.696
And she's a bully.

43:47.998 --> 43:49.030
Hmm.

43:50.737 --> 43:54.739
I do think it's interesting that
you knew Gina Loeb and Karen,

43:54.774 --> 43:56.334
and both women are missing.

43:57.036 --> 43:59.744
Are you implying that
my daughter might have...

44:00.241 --> 44:01.207
something to--

44:03.783 --> 44:07.180
Because you know who else
knew both of those women?

44:10.350 --> 44:11.448
Gina's husband.

44:13.056 --> 44:14.418
Karen would babysit for them.

44:18.160 --> 44:20.831
-Thank you both.
-You're welcome.

44:20.866 --> 44:22.030
We will be in touch.

44:23.330 --> 44:25.297
-Thanks for the coffee.
-Mm-hmm.

44:28.500 --> 44:29.972
I didn't do anything.

44:31.206 --> 44:32.370
I didn't say you did.

44:34.209 --> 44:35.340
I hope she's okay.

44:37.344 --> 44:38.750
Yeah, me too.

44:48.190 --> 44:49.761
<i> Well, to be honest,</i>
<i>like...</i>

44:49.996 --> 44:53.160
I'm really not upset that
Karen is missing.

45:00.840 --> 45:02.334
She's probably on a fuck
and coke bender

45:02.369 --> 45:03.467
with Nick the Dick.

45:09.244 --> 45:10.144
What's going on?

45:12.379 --> 45:14.346
-What is wrong with you?
-Nothing's wrong with me.

45:14.381 --> 45:15.281
I just...

45:16.117 --> 45:18.020
I mean,
what's the big deal? It's Karen.

45:18.055 --> 45:20.187
-I mean, we hate that bitch.
-I just don't know.

45:20.689 --> 45:23.487
Sorry, I just really don't wanna
talk about this right now.

45:35.204 --> 45:36.368
All right.

45:41.111 --> 45:43.210
Love you. Be good.

45:44.444 --> 45:47.214
I'll be here... just chillin.'

45:47.887 --> 45:49.018
Like a villain.

46:31.161 --> 46:34.833
Um. Sorry, um,
your sister couldn't...

46:36.430 --> 46:37.902
make it. Jack's sick.

46:39.433 --> 46:40.465
Sick?

46:42.106 --> 46:45.140
It's just a fever.
It's nothing serious.

46:46.176 --> 46:47.604
And you? How are you?

46:48.640 --> 46:49.881
Good.

46:52.182 --> 46:53.885
Something's different about you.

46:55.218 --> 46:56.514
I didn't see it before.

46:57.116 --> 47:00.155
-I'm older now, so...
-No, no, no.

47:01.224 --> 47:02.190
That ain't it.

47:05.657 --> 47:06.623
Yeah.

47:08.231 --> 47:10.297
That look, I know what that is.

47:11.399 --> 47:13.938
I've seen it before in myself.

47:17.471 --> 47:18.635
It's happened.

47:20.078 --> 47:22.276
Seen... Seen what?

47:22.311 --> 47:23.948
It's like getting your period.

47:25.545 --> 47:26.951
The women in our family

47:26.986 --> 47:30.020
always seem to meet her
at a certain age.

47:30.055 --> 47:31.087
Your mom, too.

47:32.090 --> 47:33.320
Oh, she's met her.

47:35.225 --> 47:37.522
They told me
she was a coping mechanism.

47:39.064 --> 47:41.097
Someone for me
to place the blame on.

47:45.565 --> 47:49.204
You must have
some dark, dark thoughts.

47:50.009 --> 47:51.041
I'm not...

47:52.638 --> 47:53.637
like you.

47:56.675 --> 47:58.576
I would never hurt a child.

48:01.218 --> 48:06.353
I would never...
smother and bury a child.

48:10.326 --> 48:11.523
You wanna know a secret?

48:13.626 --> 48:15.263
He wasn't smothered.

48:17.564 --> 48:21.302
Tradition demanded a bit...

48:22.140 --> 48:23.436
more...

48:24.175 --> 48:25.339
harshness.

48:27.046 --> 48:28.573
Tradition?

48:28.608 --> 48:29.948
So naive.

48:31.017 --> 48:33.182
It was an axe.

48:34.482 --> 48:37.219
Funny thing is,
I don't even remember doing it.

48:38.486 --> 48:39.716
I blacked out.

48:44.327 --> 48:48.659
You got the same evil rattlin'
around in that pretty head.

48:49.596 --> 48:51.596
I don't have any evil in me.

48:55.701 --> 48:57.074
What I do have is...

48:58.143 --> 48:59.176
freedom.

48:59.211 --> 49:02.376
You think that I don't
check in on my little sis?

49:02.845 --> 49:06.479
On you?
That adorable little baby?

49:08.417 --> 49:12.551
I like the ghost decoration
you got on your porch.

49:13.785 --> 49:15.356
Very spooky.

49:16.557 --> 49:18.425
I hope you rot in here, Diane.

49:20.132 --> 49:23.364
-It's in your blood!

I'll see her real soon!

49:55.761 --> 49:56.727
Whoa!

49:57.296 --> 49:59.697
-She just fucking attacked me.
-Hey, breathe, breathe.

49:59.732 --> 50:02.700
-She chopped up her son!
-Breathe, breathe. Breathe.

50:02.735 --> 50:07.672
-Mm-hmm. One, two.

50:12.245 --> 50:14.349
Okay. You wanna tell me
what happened?

50:18.520 --> 50:19.684
She was...

50:21.457 --> 50:23.589
She was about to tell me
about how she...

50:24.158 --> 50:26.196
she saw a woman
when she was younger,

50:26.231 --> 50:27.329
and my mom saw a woman too,

50:27.364 --> 50:28.594
and I've seen a woman.

50:28.996 --> 50:31.135
I saw a woman.
I woke up in the middle of night

50:31.170 --> 50:33.170
and there was a woman
in my fucking room

50:33.205 --> 50:34.831
and she's trying
to make me kill my family.

50:34.866 --> 50:35.799
-It's like, oh, boy...
-Wait, honey, honey.

50:35.834 --> 50:36.933
...fucking Lizzie Borden
is trying to make me

50:36.968 --> 50:39.110
-kill my family or something.
-Wait, you saw a woman?

50:40.146 --> 50:41.145
Mm-hmm.

50:41.747 --> 50:43.840
That sounds like
a little crazy even for me.

50:43.875 --> 50:44.607
Mom!

50:44.843 --> 50:46.777
-Mom!

50:47.747 --> 50:49.384
-What the fuck...

50:49.419 --> 50:51.485
-The baby's sleeping.
-What the fuck's wrong with you?

50:51.520 --> 50:52.750
When were you going to tell me?

50:53.385 --> 50:55.357
-Tell you what?
-You lied to me.

50:56.855 --> 50:58.657
She fucking killed him
with an axe.

50:59.693 --> 51:03.134
A fucking axe? That's insane.
Why didn't you tell me?

51:03.169 --> 51:04.498
You didn't think
maybe I'd want to know?

51:04.533 --> 51:06.566
Please just stop talking.

51:07.402 --> 51:10.801
I can't.
Just wait.

51:12.607 --> 51:13.672
You lied to me.

52:45.304 --> 52:47.205
What about
the hallucinations?

52:47.941 --> 52:50.604
Aunt Diane said
that you had them too.

52:51.871 --> 52:52.936
Is that true?

52:53.638 --> 52:55.741
-No.

52:57.844 --> 53:00.746
I just...

53:01.181 --> 53:03.980
I don't know, I was just trying
to make her feel better.

53:05.489 --> 53:07.291
She's my only sister.

53:08.492 --> 53:10.558
And I didn't want her to feel...

53:11.660 --> 53:14.661
so alone and so isolated.

53:17.028 --> 53:18.599
So I just made it up.

53:19.998 --> 53:21.305
She was a kid.

53:23.067 --> 53:24.275
She had a kid.

53:24.910 --> 53:28.279
And then, the whole time
she's battling this...

53:29.612 --> 53:30.677
disease.

53:37.917 --> 53:39.752
So, are you gonna tell me
what really happened?

53:50.996 --> 53:52.303
So she was...

53:54.505 --> 53:56.340
prone to blacking out...

53:57.574 --> 53:58.606
from drinking.

54:02.447 --> 54:05.008
-And I came into her room.

54:06.484 --> 54:08.451
And she was passed out
on the bed.

54:11.423 --> 54:12.554
And there was...

54:13.953 --> 54:14.985
an axe...

54:15.955 --> 54:16.987
in her hand.

54:22.731 --> 54:24.995
And the bedspread
was pulled off the bed.

54:27.868 --> 54:28.933
And there was...

54:29.969 --> 54:31.474
this little bump...

54:33.940 --> 54:35.973
underneath the sheet
next to her.

54:39.781 --> 54:41.077
And there was...

54:44.423 --> 54:45.356
blood.

54:49.791 --> 54:50.856
Lots of blood.

54:57.799 --> 54:58.798
Hello, I'm home.

55:01.165 --> 55:03.836
I'm crazy.

55:05.741 --> 55:06.740
Please...

55:10.079 --> 55:12.042
-...can we keep this our secret?

55:12.077 --> 55:13.109
Oh, hey.

55:19.887 --> 55:21.623
-You know...

55:21.658 --> 55:24.461
...you and your dad have yours,
this one will be ours.

55:24.496 --> 55:25.726
-Okay?
-What?

56:31.530 --> 56:32.296
Hello.

56:32.598 --> 56:34.498
<i> Are you still</i>
<i>my alibi for tomorrow?</i>

56:34.533 --> 56:36.962
Uh. Yeah, yeah. Even my mom
thinks you're coming over.

56:36.997 --> 56:38.733
-I totally sold it.
-<i> Good.</i>

56:40.033 --> 56:41.032
Check...

56:43.036 --> 56:44.200
this bullshit out.

56:44.702 --> 56:47.709
One second.
Give me a beat.

56:51.583 --> 56:53.649
-No.
-<i> Yeah.</i>

56:55.884 --> 56:57.147
You are crazy then.

56:58.183 --> 57:00.183
Okay, thank you so much.

57:01.824 --> 57:03.758
Tara, I just don't want you
to get hurt.

57:05.223 --> 57:06.563
<i> I gotta go.</i>

57:57.682 --> 57:59.044
Fuck.

58:03.314 --> 58:04.588
Tell her.

58:09.892 --> 58:12.530
Tell her.

58:40.351 --> 58:42.186
-Sweetie...

58:43.728 --> 58:46.597
Daddy needs time alone.
Go watch cartoons.

58:53.837 --> 58:55.573
Sweetie, please.

58:56.873 --> 58:58.202
I need ten minutes, that's it.

59:04.650 --> 59:05.847
Enough. Enough!

59:11.250 --> 59:12.722
-Told you--

59:16.662 --> 59:19.157
Okay, I'm leaving.
I'll be back tomorrow.

59:19.192 --> 59:21.027
Okay.
Tell Suzy's mom I said hi.

59:21.062 --> 59:23.227
Okay. Will do.

59:51.856 --> 59:53.356
Okay, I'm coming.

1:00:02.400 --> 1:00:04.774
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

1:00:04.809 --> 1:00:05.641
Your phone.

1:00:05.677 --> 1:00:06.842
You're my best friend
in the world.

1:00:06.877 --> 1:00:07.609
-Thank you so much.
-Love you.

1:00:07.978 --> 1:00:09.174
-You need something,

1:00:09.209 --> 1:00:11.077
you can call. Yeah, bye.

1:00:24.961 --> 1:00:25.727
<i> Dude, what is...</i>
<i>what is...</i>

1:00:25.962 --> 1:00:27.896
<i>what is this place</i>
<i>that we're going to?</i>

1:00:27.931 --> 1:00:29.425
<i> I mean, like,</i>
<i>there's a hundred hotels,</i>

1:00:29.460 --> 1:00:32.032
<i>why you dragging me</i>
<i>all the way out here?</i>

1:00:35.169 --> 1:00:36.905
<i> Tara.</i>

1:01:45.811 --> 1:01:47.536
Many think
it was jealousy.

1:01:47.571 --> 1:01:50.275
That she lost her father's
attention to her step-mom.

1:01:50.944 --> 1:01:52.981
-Was she insane?

1:01:53.016 --> 1:01:54.477
No one knows.

1:01:54.512 --> 1:01:58.118
In 1893,
she was acquitted of all charges

1:01:58.153 --> 1:02:00.054
and the murders remain unsolved.

1:02:00.756 --> 1:02:04.124
Legend has it,
her spirit lingers here

1:02:04.159 --> 1:02:06.357
looking for
a new vessel to inhabit.

1:02:07.360 --> 1:02:08.425
Oh, one second.

1:02:09.361 --> 1:02:12.935
Remember, breakfast
is served from seven to nine.

1:02:13.872 --> 1:02:16.103
<i>♪ Day is ending... ♪</i>

1:02:16.338 --> 1:02:18.402
Just go right up
the stairs. Okay?

1:02:18.437 --> 1:02:20.074
I'm so sorry.

1:02:20.109 --> 1:02:22.010
We're operating
a little short today

1:02:22.045 --> 1:02:23.473
and I am working
double duty. Oh!

1:02:23.775 --> 1:02:27.147
-I really enjoyed listening.
-Oh, thank you.

1:02:27.549 --> 1:02:30.788
-So, are you checking in?
-Yes, just one night.

1:02:31.423 --> 1:02:34.088
Oh. Lucky you.

1:02:35.058 --> 1:02:36.959
For 60 dollars more,

1:02:36.994 --> 1:02:40.292
Lizzie Borden's room
is available.

1:02:40.327 --> 1:02:42.195
-<i> Tara.</i>
-Yes.

1:02:43.099 --> 1:02:44.494
-Right.
-Really?

1:02:45.871 --> 1:02:47.805
Yeah, really.
A hundred percent really.

1:02:48.541 --> 1:02:51.303
-Okay, good. Follow me. You bet.
-Thank you.

1:02:51.338 --> 1:02:52.304
Great.

1:02:52.339 --> 1:02:54.009
-It's right up here.
-Shut up.

1:03:02.584 --> 1:03:03.953
Follow me.

1:03:07.024 --> 1:03:10.322
And for you,
the most coveted room.

1:03:12.392 --> 1:03:14.590
-Oh, my gosh.

1:03:22.633 --> 1:03:23.841
Old.

1:03:24.943 --> 1:03:28.912
So there's like no TV?
No bathroom?

1:03:28.947 --> 1:03:31.574
You share,
right across the hall.

1:03:33.281 --> 1:03:35.017
-Oh, great.
-It's perfect.

1:03:36.317 --> 1:03:39.054
Well... if you're interested,

1:03:39.356 --> 1:03:43.927
we do a candlelight seance
at eight o'clock.

1:03:44.729 --> 1:03:47.656
Now, most of our guests
are gonna be going into town

1:03:47.691 --> 1:03:49.328
for the Oktoberfest,

1:03:49.363 --> 1:03:53.233
so, it'll probably
be just a small gathering...

1:03:54.302 --> 1:03:55.301
<i> Tara.</i>

1:03:57.569 --> 1:03:58.502
We'll be there.

1:03:59.238 --> 1:04:02.671
All right, good.
Okay, eight o'clock promptly,

1:04:02.706 --> 1:04:05.080
<i>and be ready for spooky time.</i>

1:05:34.402 --> 1:05:35.665
It's her clothes.

1:05:39.308 --> 1:05:41.506
The dresses? Yes.

1:05:42.041 --> 1:05:44.740
Lizzie made
many of her own clothes.

1:05:46.051 --> 1:05:48.216
She was an expert seamstress.

1:05:49.318 --> 1:05:50.350
Well, this blouse...

1:05:51.152 --> 1:05:54.255
it's a replica of
one of her pieces.

1:05:54.657 --> 1:05:57.588
I always wear it
on seance night.

1:05:58.257 --> 1:06:01.229
Excuse me. I just need to
make a phone call.

1:06:01.264 --> 1:06:03.528
Okay,
we start in five minutes.

1:06:03.563 --> 1:06:04.463
Thank you.

1:06:06.104 --> 1:06:07.598
<i>Will you do me a favor?</i>

1:06:07.633 --> 1:06:08.732
<i>Can you go to my house</i>

1:06:08.768 --> 1:06:11.569
<i>and grab all the old vintage</i>
<i>clothes from my room</i>

1:06:11.604 --> 1:06:14.143
<i>and there's a wooden box</i>
<i>in the basement, too.</i>

1:06:14.178 --> 1:06:15.606
<i>Can you just</i>
<i>grab everything from there?</i>

1:06:15.641 --> 1:06:17.443
Wait, all the...
all the frilly old stuff?

1:06:17.478 --> 1:06:18.177
Yeah.

1:06:18.546 --> 1:06:21.051
Just grab everything
and put it in a trash bag

1:06:21.086 --> 1:06:22.448
and just take it
to your house, please.

1:06:22.483 --> 1:06:23.713
Just get it
out of my house, please.

1:06:23.748 --> 1:06:25.286
And why?

1:06:25.721 --> 1:06:27.618
I don't know. It's...

1:06:27.653 --> 1:06:29.455
It's like a trigger
or something.

1:06:29.490 --> 1:06:31.160
Wait, fuck.
What do I tell your mom?

1:06:33.098 --> 1:06:34.724
Divine inspiration hit,

1:06:34.759 --> 1:06:37.661
and I want to
work on stuff at your house.

1:06:37.696 --> 1:06:39.630
<i> Sorry.</i>

1:06:39.665 --> 1:06:41.698
<i>But, you know, the progression</i>
<i>of this, right, is you</i>
<i>asking me</i>

1:06:41.733 --> 1:06:43.469
<i>-for a body part next.</i>

1:06:43.938 --> 1:06:45.801
Yeah, well,
you already have my heart.

1:06:46.103 --> 1:06:47.242
I love you.

1:06:47.911 --> 1:06:49.343
<i> Thank you.</i>
<i>I appreciate it.</i>

1:06:50.841 --> 1:06:55.184
-Night.

1:07:11.301 --> 1:07:12.630
What I try to do

1:07:12.665 --> 1:07:16.304
is to summon
a spirit of the Borden family.

1:07:17.175 --> 1:07:18.273
We begin.

1:07:20.673 --> 1:07:21.539
Mm.

1:07:21.574 --> 1:07:24.609
I call upon
the spirits of this house

1:07:25.178 --> 1:07:27.447
to grant us
a moment of your time.

1:07:28.750 --> 1:07:33.222
I offer my consciousness
as a conduit to this world.

1:07:33.257 --> 1:07:37.391
-I beseech all.

1:07:37.426 --> 1:07:41.362
-I open myself to you.
-<i> Tara.</i>

1:07:42.464 --> 1:07:46.763
I offer...
my aura as a path.

1:07:47.365 --> 1:07:50.338
I call upon Lizzie Borden.

1:07:53.277 --> 1:07:54.573
Join us at our table.

1:07:56.907 --> 1:07:59.809
I offer my consciousness

1:07:59.844 --> 1:08:01.217
-to you.
-<i> Tara.</i>

1:08:02.517 --> 1:08:04.286
Take my hands. It might help.

1:08:06.389 --> 1:08:08.290
Don't you dare
touch me, old bitch.

1:08:09.260 --> 1:08:10.126
Tara?

1:08:10.161 --> 1:08:12.294
I killed you once.
I'll kill you again.

1:08:12.890 --> 1:08:13.856
Tara?

1:08:14.725 --> 1:08:16.892
I knew you were trouble
the minute I met you.

1:08:18.302 --> 1:08:19.697
Trying to replace my mother...

1:08:20.898 --> 1:08:22.634
stealing my father from me.

1:08:23.470 --> 1:08:26.407
Tara, please.
You're... You're scaring me.

1:08:26.976 --> 1:08:29.641
If this is an act,
I want you to stop.

1:08:30.512 --> 1:08:31.643
Here you are.

1:08:33.218 --> 1:08:36.648
Here you are...
here I am. It's all so...

1:08:38.916 --> 1:08:42.159
it's so familiar.

1:08:45.989 --> 1:08:47.890
Tara? Tara,
come back here.

1:08:57.638 --> 1:08:58.538
Tara?

1:09:07.978 --> 1:09:12.519
You never loved my father.
No, you didn't.

1:09:13.054 --> 1:09:18.624
<i>♪ Lizzie Borden took an axe</i>

This is an act.

1:09:35.313 --> 1:09:39.414
Was this... Lizzie's axe?

1:09:39.849 --> 1:09:41.515
-Yes.
-Yes.

1:09:41.550 --> 1:09:44.353
This is my... axe.

1:09:44.388 --> 1:09:46.850

Tara, no!

1:10:15.419 --> 1:10:16.118
Carl!

1:10:16.454 --> 1:10:18.486
-Watch out! Now!
-Are you insane?

1:10:19.055 --> 1:10:20.719
What the fuck. What's wrong?

1:10:20.754 --> 1:10:23.018
She was acting
like she was possessed.

1:10:23.687 --> 1:10:26.593
I never met anything in my life.
This is just--

1:10:26.628 --> 1:10:29.860
-I don't know.

1:10:41.412 --> 1:10:42.543
What's wrong?

1:10:59.397 --> 1:11:01.727
I think...
I think I really need help...

1:11:08.967 --> 1:11:09.966
you know?

1:11:12.377 --> 1:11:13.640
What if I did something?

1:12:48.000 --> 1:12:49.164
Hey.

1:12:49.666 --> 1:12:51.540
Sorry, she's sewing,
you know how...

1:12:51.575 --> 1:12:53.575
-Yeah.
-...she is.

1:12:53.610 --> 1:12:56.512
She's in, uh,
no answer the phone zone now.

1:12:56.547 --> 1:12:57.546
Yeah.

1:12:58.015 --> 1:13:00.175
-So, all the clothes?
-Yep.

1:13:00.210 --> 1:13:01.649
I mean, in
the basement...

1:13:02.619 --> 1:13:04.179
behind the furnace.

1:13:04.214 --> 1:13:05.785
-Okay.
-In the back.

1:13:05.820 --> 1:13:06.984
Thank you.

1:14:03.713 --> 1:14:05.009
This fucking place.

1:14:17.089 --> 1:14:21.861
-Okay.

1:16:00.225 --> 1:16:01.994
She's not picking up.
I don't know why.

1:16:09.740 --> 1:16:11.168
<i> Hey, it's Suzy.</i>
<i>Leave a message.</i>

1:16:12.270 --> 1:16:13.401
Hey, call me when you get this.

1:16:13.436 --> 1:16:15.810
I'm getting...
getting kind of worried.

1:16:44.973 --> 1:16:48.436
Hey, Em. I-- Listen, I just
want to say I'm... I'm sorry.

1:16:48.471 --> 1:16:50.680
I... I... I've been crazed
with work

1:16:50.715 --> 1:16:52.407
and, um, haven't been
home much, but...

1:16:55.819 --> 1:16:58.017
No. You know what?
No more excuses.

1:16:58.052 --> 1:16:59.447
Running isn't the way.
I know that now.

1:16:59.482 --> 1:17:02.219
We need to face this,
this whole thing.

1:17:02.421 --> 1:17:05.057
<i>Tara, your sister,</i>
<i>this damn curse.</i>

1:17:05.092 --> 1:17:06.124
<i>All of it. Head on.</i>

1:17:07.060 --> 1:17:08.764
<i>All right, I'm heading home.</i>
<i>We need to talk.</i>

1:17:09.199 --> 1:17:10.931
<i>Okay. We need to help Tara.</i>

1:17:26.850 --> 1:17:27.916

<i>Body identified as missing</i>

1:17:32.015 --> 1:17:35.417
<i>Possible dead body inside</i>
<i>the house of Mikhail Loeb.</i>

1:17:36.253 --> 1:17:39.223
I'd say
that dress knew it was a downer.

1:17:41.599 --> 1:17:43.700
Carl,
that's Gina Loeb's house.

1:17:56.341 --> 1:17:58.275
-Is that Suzy's car?
-What?

1:17:59.044 --> 1:18:01.080
Pull up. Pull into
the driveway right now.

1:18:02.479 --> 1:18:04.182
-Pull into the driveway.
-Okay.

1:18:28.505 --> 1:18:30.307
Are you sure
somebody's in the house?

1:18:30.342 --> 1:18:31.506
My mom should be.

1:18:31.541 --> 1:18:33.178
You know I'll go
in there with you.

1:18:33.213 --> 1:18:35.180
I don't mind getting yelled at.

1:18:35.215 --> 1:18:36.544
-I just want to find Suzy.

1:18:58.040 --> 1:18:59.501
<i> Hey, it's Suzy.</i>
<i>Leave a message.</i>

1:19:07.049 --> 1:19:09.313
Mom! Caleb!

1:19:09.348 --> 1:19:11.381
-Suzy!

1:19:11.416 --> 1:19:12.921
What about your dad?
Where is he?

1:19:12.956 --> 1:19:14.285
He's not supposed to
be home until later.

1:19:14.320 --> 1:19:15.385
Just my mom and Caleb.

1:19:16.322 --> 1:19:17.222
And Jack.

1:19:17.657 --> 1:19:19.257
-Baby Jack.
-Oh, fuck.

1:19:22.031 --> 1:19:23.129
Wait!

1:19:43.613 --> 1:19:44.887
Caleb?

1:19:46.220 --> 1:19:47.989
Caleb? Thank God.

1:19:48.524 --> 1:19:50.519
-I'm sorry, Tara.
-It's okay.

1:19:50.554 --> 1:19:52.191
I thought
I heard a phone.

1:19:52.726 --> 1:19:55.964
Suzy's in the trunk.
She's... She's dead.

1:20:05.976 --> 1:20:07.338
-I thought of Jack.

1:20:07.773 --> 1:20:13.080
I heard someone coming,
so I crawled up here with him.

1:20:13.115 --> 1:20:14.213
What about Mom?

1:20:18.582 --> 1:20:21.319
I need you to
stay up here, okay?

1:20:21.354 --> 1:20:22.254
Do you understand?

1:20:22.656 --> 1:20:24.058
-Say yes.
-Yes.

1:20:26.161 --> 1:20:27.523
Take this.

1:20:28.460 --> 1:20:29.624
Call 911.

1:20:32.629 --> 1:20:34.002
Hey, Tara. Come on, come on.

1:20:34.037 --> 1:20:35.234
-Tara, come on. Come on.
-What?

1:20:35.269 --> 1:20:37.005
Someone's in here.
Someone's in here. Tara.

1:20:37.040 --> 1:20:38.138
Give me that stick.

1:20:41.506 --> 1:20:42.472
I love you.

1:20:49.987 --> 1:20:51.217
Hey, sport. What's going--

1:20:54.156 --> 1:20:57.520
Caleb, hey. Wait, what?
No, I can't make out...

1:20:58.358 --> 1:20:59.489
Caleb, hang on.

1:21:01.097 --> 1:21:02.228
Who hurt who? What?

1:21:02.964 --> 1:21:04.527
In the attic?
What are you talk--

1:21:04.562 --> 1:21:06.364
Where's your mom?
Put your mom--

1:21:07.499 --> 1:21:08.498
Where's Tara?

1:21:10.502 --> 1:21:11.368
Okay, hang on.

1:21:11.403 --> 1:21:13.470
Caleb, listen to me.
Listen carefully.

1:21:13.505 --> 1:21:15.307
Just... Just stay quiet.
Don't move.

1:21:15.342 --> 1:21:16.671
I'm calling 911. Stay there.

1:21:16.706 --> 1:21:18.574
No matter what you hear,
don't move.

1:21:21.282 --> 1:21:23.018
<i>911, what's your emergency?</i>

1:21:56.185 --> 1:21:57.217
Get away from him!

1:21:59.056 --> 1:22:00.649
-You okay?

1:22:00.684 --> 1:22:03.058
-Are you okay?
-No. I'm not okay.

1:22:03.093 --> 1:22:05.357
-Fuck!
-You're gonna be okay.

1:22:05.392 --> 1:22:08.030
No. I'm not okay. Fuck!

1:22:08.065 --> 1:22:09.460
I'm not in the mood right now.

1:22:13.070 --> 1:22:15.070
-Just hold on tight.

1:22:33.156 --> 1:22:35.057
Come on, Em, pick up. Pick up!

1:22:35.587 --> 1:22:37.059
Dammit. Goddammit.

1:22:44.728 --> 1:22:45.661
Oh, my God.

1:22:50.668 --> 1:22:52.272
Oh, my God, Aunt Diane.

1:23:09.819 --> 1:23:11.027
No.

1:23:24.273 --> 1:23:25.437
Hello, Tara.

1:23:29.575 --> 1:23:33.247
Ugh! Ah!

1:23:35.284 --> 1:23:38.582
It feels so good.

1:23:39.651 --> 1:23:43.785
It has been... so long...

1:23:48.231 --> 1:23:49.725
...living a lie.

1:23:51.234 --> 1:23:53.333
Years and years of just...

1:23:54.035 --> 1:23:57.436
hiding behind all those pills.

1:23:57.471 --> 1:23:59.207
Mom,
why is there blood on you?

1:23:59.242 --> 1:24:00.835
Dulling the pain.

1:24:04.346 --> 1:24:06.115
-You don't like it?
-Mom, stop.

1:24:06.150 --> 1:24:08.513
-Let's play a game.
-Mom, you're scaring me.

1:24:53.659 --> 1:24:55.692
-Mom?

1:24:56.860 --> 1:24:59.465
Mom, this is not you.
You're my mom.

1:25:00.963 --> 1:25:02.798
You're Jack's mom.
You're Caleb's mom.

1:25:02.833 --> 1:25:04.437
You're my mom. Okay?

1:25:08.145 --> 1:25:11.312
-I don't know why. I'm sorry.

1:25:19.322 --> 1:25:21.322
It's okay.
You can't fight it alone.

1:25:21.357 --> 1:25:24.457
I'm not alone, right?

1:25:25.658 --> 1:25:28.230
I have you. Right?

1:25:30.195 --> 1:25:33.400
-I love you so much.
-I love you, too.

1:25:34.832 --> 1:25:37.767
You need help, Mom.

1:25:37.802 --> 1:25:40.209
And I need help. We need help.

1:25:42.004 --> 1:25:43.938
But what if I don't
want help, huh?

1:25:48.010 --> 1:25:49.845
Get out of the way!

1:25:58.060 --> 1:26:00.856
You have a little bite,
don't you?

1:26:01.425 --> 1:26:03.199
You have a little bite.

1:26:04.829 --> 1:26:06.895
Who could play spin the bar.

1:26:10.604 --> 1:26:12.604
Oh, not you.

1:26:14.003 --> 1:26:17.576
I think I'm gonna go find Caleb.

1:26:17.611 --> 1:26:19.446
My little Boy Scout.

1:26:20.812 --> 1:26:25.683
Oh,
and that sniveling baby, too.

1:26:25.718 --> 1:26:29.456
All he does is cry and cry.
He's like the other one.

1:26:29.491 --> 1:26:33.493
But that one
was an abomination. That one...

1:26:34.628 --> 1:26:37.530
I quieted him.

1:26:37.565 --> 1:26:39.532
-He was so quiet.
-What other one?

1:26:40.964 --> 1:26:42.700
What do you mean,
what other one?

1:26:42.735 --> 1:26:44.372
You think she did it?

1:26:45.738 --> 1:26:47.771
-No.

1:26:48.540 --> 1:26:50.708
Do you think
she could do it?

1:26:51.777 --> 1:26:53.007
She can't do anything.

1:26:56.815 --> 1:26:57.979
No, I did that.

1:26:59.048 --> 1:27:00.883
I righted the affront to God.

1:27:01.418 --> 1:27:04.788
I was a good girl. I did that!

1:27:05.123 --> 1:27:09.529
You see, a child
born of incest...nobody
wants that.

1:27:11.467 --> 1:27:13.962
My father betrayed my mother.

1:27:15.064 --> 1:27:17.834
He's a bad boy, poop.

1:27:18.804 --> 1:27:20.573
You're a bad girl

1:27:20.608 --> 1:27:25.611
because you're trying
to betray me

1:27:25.646 --> 1:27:29.010
-with your father.
-What are you talking about?

1:27:29.045 --> 1:27:30.078
-What are you talking...
-No, Mom.

1:27:30.447 --> 1:27:33.850
...about, Mom?
I know what
I'm talking about.

1:27:34.385 --> 1:27:37.755
I see you. I see you.

1:27:37.790 --> 1:27:42.023
I see you trying
to take my place.

1:27:42.058 --> 1:27:44.399
My place!

1:27:44.434 --> 1:27:45.961
You cannot take my place.

1:27:46.596 --> 1:27:48.799
Do you think I'm fucking crazy?

1:27:49.234 --> 1:27:51.604
Do you think I'm fucking blind?

1:27:52.106 --> 1:27:54.343
No, I see everything.

1:27:54.840 --> 1:27:56.004
Everything!

1:27:57.007 --> 1:27:58.380
But it doesn't matter...

1:27:59.049 --> 1:28:03.913
because all of you
will get what you deserve.

1:28:12.088 --> 1:28:14.627
-Then do it.

1:28:14.662 --> 1:28:16.398
It's the police. The police!

1:28:16.433 --> 1:28:17.564
I'm not gonna kill you.

1:28:17.599 --> 1:28:18.895
Open the door!

1:28:19.502 --> 1:28:20.501
Okay.

1:28:33.516 --> 1:28:36.418
-<i> Emily!</i>
-<i> Mom!</i>

1:28:38.521 --> 1:28:39.520
<i>Mom!</i>

1:28:40.886 --> 1:28:41.852
<i>Mom!</i>

1:28:50.830 --> 1:28:53.061
-No, no, no.

1:30:36.034 --> 1:30:37.539
Is he gonna be okay?

1:30:53.183 --> 1:30:54.248
Where's your sister?

1:30:55.119 --> 1:30:56.954
Upstairs still.

1:31:02.599 --> 1:31:03.763
Can I start the car?

1:31:04.499 --> 1:31:06.601
My nine-year-old
wants to start the car?

1:31:06.636 --> 1:31:07.536
Yes.

1:31:12.334 --> 1:31:13.542
Tara!

1:31:17.581 --> 1:31:18.646
Tara!

1:31:52.308 --> 1:31:53.307
Hi.

1:31:54.178 --> 1:31:55.177
Hey.

1:31:56.983 --> 1:31:58.246
Hey, I hate to ask...

1:31:58.781 --> 1:32:00.182
Don't worry. I took 'em.

1:32:06.124 --> 1:32:07.992
I won't let her get to you.

1:32:36.220 --> 1:32:37.989
He doesn't even have
his seatbelt on,

1:32:38.024 --> 1:32:41.223
but he's about to win
his, like, bajillionth Daytona.

1:32:45.867 --> 1:32:47.064
Yeah!

1:32:50.773 --> 1:32:52.135
Yes, I won!

1:32:52.704 --> 1:32:56.106
-Hey, thanks.
