07:55.559 --> 07:57.394
See you guys later.
‐ All right, y'all. Peace out.

07:57.394 --> 07:58.687
‐ All right.

07:59.813 --> 08:01.023
‐ Cameron Brooks.

08:02.482 --> 08:03.984
He was a good man.

08:03.984 --> 08:05.861
WOMAN: Yeah.
‐ An honest man.

08:06.570 --> 08:09.489
A man on whom I could always rely...

08:10.157 --> 08:11.909
to have some dank‐ass weed!

08:11.909 --> 08:14.244
‐ Yes, that is true.
[laughter]

08:14.244 --> 08:16.663
WOMAN: And so I was saddened,
as many of you were,

08:16.663 --> 08:18.957
to hear of his apparent passing.

08:19.374 --> 08:21.752
That's right.
He's dead now.

08:22.294 --> 08:23.879
Rest in peace, ya bitch!

08:23.879 --> 08:27.216
[all cheering]

08:29.635 --> 08:32.346
‐ Oh! Roberto is here!

08:32.346 --> 08:34.556
My life is made!
‐ Hey!

08:34.556 --> 08:36.350
THE HAMMER:
Bartender! <i>Signori!</i>

08:36.350 --> 08:38.060
<i>Drei</i> whiskey, <i>bitte,</i>

08:38.060 --> 08:40.938
<i>danke,</i> for my three best friends.

08:42.147 --> 08:43.148
‐ He's bad at counting.

08:43.148 --> 08:44.441
Oh, my God.
‐ Yeah.

08:44.441 --> 08:45.442
‐ Rob.
‐ Mm‐hmm.

08:45.442 --> 08:47.277
‐ I am so glad that you're here.

08:47.277 --> 08:48.237
‐ What's going, what's going on?

08:48.237 --> 08:51.365
‐ I have realized that my life is... over.

08:51.365 --> 08:51.907
Very soon.

08:52.491 --> 08:53.700
You know, very soon.

08:54.284 --> 08:56.954
And so this, all this, this is, uh,

08:57.412 --> 08:58.789
my Last Hurrah.

08:58.789 --> 09:00.082
You know? Look.

09:00.082 --> 09:01.667
See? It's official.

09:01.667 --> 09:03.669
‐ Wow.
‐ Now, Rob, question for you.

09:03.669 --> 09:07.047
Is your cute friend
from the record store also coming?

09:07.047 --> 09:09.091
‐ Cherise?
‐ Yes.

09:09.091 --> 09:10.759
‐ No. No.

09:10.759 --> 09:11.844
‐ Oh, I don't care.

09:12.761 --> 09:15.889
‐ Hey, is your cute wife
from your house coming?

09:15.889 --> 09:17.099
‐ Oh. Mmm.

09:17.599 --> 09:18.767
Put your brakes on.

09:18.767 --> 09:20.269
BOTH:
Mm, mm, mm, mm.

09:20.269 --> 09:21.144
CAMERON:
Don't do that.

09:21.144 --> 09:24.189
So, I did a full jukebox takeover.

09:24.189 --> 09:26.358
The complete and unabridged soundtrack

09:26.358 --> 09:27.818
of my previous life.
MAN: What's up, Cam?

09:28.318 --> 09:30.153
‐ Now, Rob, have I ever told you

09:30.153 --> 09:33.115
about the time I got kicked out
of Daniel Day‐Lewis' birthday.

09:33.115 --> 09:34.616
If you're under 75‐‐

09:34.616 --> 09:36.577
‐ Fuck! You invited Mac?
‐ Hmm?

09:36.577 --> 09:38.078
‐ Mac is here?

09:38.620 --> 09:39.621
CAMERON:
Oh, yeah.

09:40.163 --> 09:41.164
Yeah.

09:42.124 --> 09:43.959
Okay.
Full disclosure.

09:44.626 --> 09:45.836
I am very high right now.

09:45.836 --> 09:49.173
I will probably be doing some
very questionable things this evening.

09:49.173 --> 09:49.923
‐ So questionable.

09:49.923 --> 09:52.426
‐ And, also, you know whose team I'm on.

09:52.426 --> 09:54.428
‐ Yes.
‐ It's team R‐O‐B, baby.

09:54.428 --> 09:55.637
THE HAMMER:
It's team R‐O‐B.

09:55.637 --> 09:57.222
‐ That guy's been here
since the beginning.

09:57.222 --> 09:59.391
I mean, it's only fitting that I step up

09:59.391 --> 10:01.101
and be the bigger man, so that's what‐‐

10:01.101 --> 10:03.770
‐ [scoffs] Yeah, this is a real
big boy party you got here, big man.

10:03.770 --> 10:05.814
‐ Well, what do you want me to do,
kick him out, okay?

10:05.814 --> 10:07.357
‐ No, no.
‐ No. Right?

10:07.357 --> 10:10.611
So just fuckin' take a shot. Boom.

10:10.611 --> 10:12.404
Who loves you? It's me.

10:13.197 --> 10:14.323
‐ Oh, hey!

10:14.323 --> 10:15.699
[indiscernible conversation]

10:15.699 --> 10:17.159
CAMERON:
And now we're cool.

10:20.913 --> 10:21.914
[exhales sharply]

10:23.123 --> 10:25.042
‐ Hey, Sammy, what's up, man?
‐ What's happening?

10:25.042 --> 10:26.168
‐ Got an extra one of those?

10:26.168 --> 10:27.377
‐ For you, baby.
‐ Thank you.

10:29.254 --> 10:30.589
SAMMY:
You outta here?

10:30.589 --> 10:31.840
‐ Yeah, I gotta jet, man.
‐ Do your thing.

10:31.840 --> 10:32.883
‐ Good to see you.
‐ Rob?

10:33.634 --> 10:34.968
Hi.

10:34.968 --> 10:36.803
I'm Lily. I'm Mac's fiancée?

10:37.721 --> 10:39.640
‐ Hi. Yeah, hi.
‐ Hey.

10:40.098 --> 10:41.934
I just wanted to say hi
and introduce myself.

10:41.934 --> 10:43.769
‐ Yeah, yeah, it's, uh,
it's nice to meet you.

10:45.103 --> 10:46.605
You fucking bitch.

10:51.610 --> 10:53.070
‐ I'm Lily. I'm Mac's fiancée?

10:53.820 --> 10:56.823
‐ I, uh, I like your shoes.
‐ Oh! Thank you.

10:56.823 --> 10:59.201
‐ You gonna be able to run in those?
‐ What?

11:00.786 --> 11:02.621
‐ Don't come back, you fuckin' bitch!

11:02.621 --> 11:04.081
I'll fuckin' gouge your fuckin' eyes out!

11:05.457 --> 11:06.917
‐ I'm Lily. I'm Mac's fiancée?

11:08.126 --> 11:09.169
[Lily screams]

11:10.170 --> 11:11.088
‐ You bitch!

11:14.049 --> 11:15.509
‐ I'm Lily. I'm Mac's fiancée?

11:18.095 --> 11:19.596
‐ Hi. Hey. Yeah.

11:19.596 --> 11:22.391
Um, congratulations on the... thing.

11:22.391 --> 11:23.517
‐ Thanks.

11:23.934 --> 11:25.978
Look, I was just‐‐ I wanted to say

11:25.978 --> 11:27.938
I, I really hope you're not leaving
on our account.

11:28.397 --> 11:30.899
I mean, we could totally go
if you're at all uncomfortable.

11:31.358 --> 11:32.484
These are your people, you know?

11:32.484 --> 11:35.028
‐ Pff. No, no, I'm,
I'm totally comfortable.

11:35.028 --> 11:37.197
I was just actually making a phone call.

11:37.614 --> 11:38.615
Yeah.

11:38.615 --> 11:40.450
I, I can't leave my brother
in there alone, you know.

11:40.450 --> 11:42.619
He's, uh... incredibly irresponsible.

11:42.619 --> 11:43.954
Makes horrible life choices.

11:44.371 --> 11:45.998
‐ Okay. Good. I'm glad.

11:46.456 --> 11:48.876
Look, I know that this is
a little bit weird,

11:48.876 --> 11:51.712
but I was just thinking
maybe we could all drink

11:51.712 --> 11:52.629
until it's not weird.

11:52.629 --> 11:53.797
I don't know. What do you think?

11:54.256 --> 11:55.340
First round on me?

11:55.340 --> 11:57.342
‐ Yeah. Yeah! Sounds great.

11:57.342 --> 11:58.343
‐ Awesome.

11:58.343 --> 11:59.720
All right. See you in there.

11:59.720 --> 12:00.679
‐ See you in there.

12:02.431 --> 12:03.891
What the fuck is her problem?

12:05.601 --> 12:07.895
[exhales heavily]
Okay, I need backup.

12:12.774 --> 12:14.234
[line ringing]
[clears throat]

12:14.234 --> 12:15.819
SIMON: [voicemail]
<i>Uh, hey, you got Simon.</i>

12:15.819 --> 12:18.155
<i>Um, nobody calls anybody no more.</i>

12:18.155 --> 12:19.823
<i>Just, just send me a text‐‐</i>

12:21.825 --> 12:23.493
[line ringing]

12:23.493 --> 12:25.204
CHERISE: [voicemail]
<i>You out here calling my phone,</i>

12:25.204 --> 12:26.371
<i>worried about what I'm doing‐‐</i>

12:26.371 --> 12:27.706
‐ You got to be kidding me.

12:33.420 --> 12:34.254
[line rings]

12:36.256 --> 12:38.217
‐ A little warning, is all I'm saying.

12:38.217 --> 12:39.760
A little warning
would have been nice, dude.

12:39.760 --> 12:42.513
CAM: Yeah. Well, you don't
need warning, okay. Look at you.

12:42.513 --> 12:44.264
You're a boss.

12:44.264 --> 12:45.641
‐ I'm sorry. I think I do need warning.

12:45.641 --> 12:48.352
I'm in flats and Mac's with fuckin'
Andre the Giant's hot cousin.

12:48.352 --> 12:49.770
Hey.
MAC: Hey, Rob.

12:49.770 --> 12:51.188
Thought I might run into you here.

12:51.188 --> 12:52.814
‐ Yes, yes, you‐‐

12:52.814 --> 12:54.191
Because I'm an alcoholic.

12:54.191 --> 12:56.026
Whoo!
[laughter]

12:56.026 --> 12:57.236
THE HAMMER:
We all are.

12:57.611 --> 12:58.987
‐ No, I mean, you know, it's Cam's thing,

12:58.987 --> 13:00.864
and you're his sister, so‐‐

13:01.281 --> 13:04.117
‐ Right. Yes, that is also a reason
why I would‐‐

13:04.743 --> 13:06.036
Yep.
MAC: Mm‐hmm.

13:06.036 --> 13:07.329
Can I sit down?

13:07.788 --> 13:09.248
‐ Yeah. For sure.

13:09.248 --> 13:11.416
CAMERON:
Ah, Mac. Cheers it up.

13:11.416 --> 13:12.960
You want, uh, you want another one?

13:12.960 --> 13:14.211
‐ No, I'm good, I'm good.

13:14.211 --> 13:15.420
‐ I'm good too.

13:16.129 --> 13:17.130
‐ Great.

13:21.093 --> 13:22.928
How you doing?
‐ 'Sup?

13:23.303 --> 13:24.847
‐ You good?
‐ Mm‐hmm.

13:24.847 --> 13:26.306
Yeah, I'm good.
‐ Mm‐hmm.

13:26.306 --> 13:28.183
‐ How are you?
‐ Yeah, I'm fine, I just, uh‐‐

13:28.183 --> 13:29.184
‐ Hey.
‐ Hey.

13:29.184 --> 13:30.310
‐ Hi.
‐ You're back.

13:30.310 --> 13:31.478
‐ I'm, I'm back.

13:32.187 --> 13:34.106
‐ For you.
‐ Oh, thank you.

13:34.940 --> 13:36.066
‐ Whiskey neat, right?

13:36.066 --> 13:37.609
‐ Yes, that is, that's my drink.

13:38.151 --> 13:38.986
Thank you.

13:39.987 --> 13:41.572
‐ Cheers.
‐ Cheers.

13:41.572 --> 13:42.573
‐ Cheers.
[bottles clink]

13:44.116 --> 13:46.034
‐ Mm, I love your shirt, by the way.

13:47.536 --> 13:49.079
‐ Oh, thanks. Thank you.

13:49.580 --> 13:50.831
I love your sweatshirt.

13:51.582 --> 13:52.541
‐ Thank you.

13:52.916 --> 13:54.459
I didn't know we were going out

13:54.459 --> 13:58.589
and so I kind of had two big
Belgian waffles for dinner,

13:58.589 --> 14:00.215
so... here we are!

14:00.215 --> 14:01.466
‐ Right.

14:06.638 --> 14:08.223
‐ Hey, how's the store?

14:08.932 --> 14:10.184
‐ Oh, it's really good!

14:10.184 --> 14:11.393
Really good, you know.
MAC: That's good.

14:11.393 --> 14:13.103
‐ It's like it's busy. We're good.

14:13.937 --> 14:15.606
‐ Good.
‐ Yeah.

14:16.064 --> 14:18.066
‐ That's good.
‐ That's good.

14:18.483 --> 14:19.735
MAC:
I'm pleased to hear.

14:21.820 --> 14:22.863
‐ Hi.

14:22.863 --> 14:23.739
‐ Hey!

14:23.739 --> 14:24.823
Hi.

14:25.657 --> 14:26.992
How are you. Mm.
‐ Good.

14:29.411 --> 14:30.746
‐ I hit you up.
‐ Yeah.

14:30.746 --> 14:31.830
Yeah, you did.
[Rob chuckles]

14:31.830 --> 14:34.625
‐ Um, this is Clyde, you guys.
This is, um, Mac.

14:34.625 --> 14:37.503
And his... fiancée.

14:37.503 --> 14:39.338
‐ Oh. Hey, congrats.
MAC: Thank you.

14:39.338 --> 14:40.631
CLYDE: That's awesome.
‐ Thanks.

14:40.631 --> 14:41.924
‐ Thanks.
CLYDE: Cool.

14:42.674 --> 14:43.926
LILY:
So, Clyde.

14:43.926 --> 14:45.677
CLYDE: Yeah?
‐ Where are you coming from?

14:45.677 --> 14:47.054
‐ Oh, my climbing gym,

14:47.054 --> 14:48.305
just around the corner.

14:48.305 --> 14:49.223
Yeah.

14:49.223 --> 14:50.557
‐ Don't laugh at‐‐
‐ Sorry.

14:50.557 --> 14:51.850
‐ Yeah, don't have to‐‐

14:51.850 --> 14:53.060
‐ Oh, man, making me feel bad.

14:53.060 --> 14:55.062
I haven't signed up to the gym
since I've been back.

14:55.062 --> 14:56.396
‐ Well, don't feel bad on my account.

14:56.396 --> 14:58.690
I wasn't, uh, working out. Just over there

14:59.233 --> 15:00.317
doing some volunteering.

15:00.317 --> 15:02.152
‐ Well, thanks, now I feel even worse.

15:02.152 --> 15:03.862
‐ Sorry, man.
‐ He's joking.

15:03.862 --> 15:05.072
Sorry.
‐ Oh.

15:05.072 --> 15:06.573
‐ I'm not, I'm, uh‐‐

15:08.116 --> 15:10.452
I'm not‐‐ Sorry, I'm not joking. I, uh‐‐

15:11.578 --> 15:15.374
There's, it's free classes for these kids
who are, like, underprivileged youth.

15:15.374 --> 15:18.418
And they do it, uh, once a week,
but I go, like, twice a month

15:18.418 --> 15:20.087
to try to, like, you know, chip in.

15:20.087 --> 15:21.797
‐ Oh, I didn't, I didn't know that.

15:21.797 --> 15:23.882
‐ That's cool, man.
‐ That is so cool.

15:23.882 --> 15:25.384
‐ Thanks.
‐ That is really cool.

15:25.384 --> 15:26.301
‐ Yeah.

15:26.301 --> 15:30.305
It really... it started
as self‐serving act.

15:30.305 --> 15:32.391
‐ How is volunteering a self‐serving act?

15:32.391 --> 15:33.100
‐ Yeah.

15:33.100 --> 15:36.436
‐ Uh... I guess we're doing this.

15:36.687 --> 15:41.441
I, uh, I have a fear of... kids.

15:42.192 --> 15:43.151
They intimidate me.

15:43.151 --> 15:45.320
‐ You what? How do kids intimidate you?

15:45.320 --> 15:47.281
‐ Oh, I don't know, I just want them
to like me, a lot,

15:47.281 --> 15:49.700
and I try to impress them
and I kind of freeze up

15:49.700 --> 15:51.451
and then I try really hard

15:51.451 --> 15:54.246
and, uh, they, they can sense

15:54.246 --> 15:56.164
how thirsty I am for approval.

15:56.707 --> 15:59.251
And then I really go for it

15:59.251 --> 16:02.754
and spin out and it gets weird,
and... it's not good for anyone.

16:03.589 --> 16:05.966
So I'm coming off of that,
just really want‐‐

16:05.966 --> 16:07.050
‐ Do you want a drink?
‐ Uh, yes.

16:07.050 --> 16:08.552
‐ Yeah.
‐ Please, I would.

16:09.094 --> 16:10.053
Oh, man.

16:14.850 --> 16:17.436
‐ Man, that's, uh,
that's really cool of you, man.
