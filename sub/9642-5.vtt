WEBVTT

00:07.375 --> 00:09.083
Max!

00:09.083 --> 00:12.625
Did you spin yourself into
a cotton candy cocoon again?

00:18.375 --> 00:21.333
- Just get it...
- You know what?

00:21.333 --> 00:23.208
This kind of behavior

00:23.208 --> 00:25.625
is exactly why
you need to get into

00:25.625 --> 00:28.375
the Sophisticated Wizards
of the World Club.

00:28.375 --> 00:31.333
They take future wizards
and they mold their minds,

00:31.333 --> 00:32.583
into becoming...

00:32.583 --> 00:34.500
Oh. Guys like that.

00:34.500 --> 00:38.416
Look, he's got
his wand in his briefcase.

00:38.416 --> 00:41.875
That's weird. I usually keep
my briefs in my wand case.

00:41.875 --> 00:44.875
Oh, boy. We gotta
call them right now.

00:44.875 --> 00:46.500
Come on.

00:46.500 --> 00:48.750
Justin, please, just tell me.
Ooh, cotton candy.

00:48.750 --> 00:50.458
Max was in it.

00:50.458 --> 00:52.416
Please, Justin.

00:52.416 --> 00:54.583
You have your delinquent class
to help you get ahead,

00:54.583 --> 00:57.708
just tell me how
I can raise my standings
in the wizard competition.

00:57.708 --> 00:59.458
Are you kidding me?
I'll never give you the key

00:59.458 --> 01:01.208
to possibly winning
the wizard competition.

01:02.708 --> 01:04.833
OK, well, fine.

01:04.833 --> 01:07.875
I'll just think of
a clever way to
get it out of you.

01:07.875 --> 01:10.500
Yeah, OK.

01:10.500 --> 01:14.583
Or, I'll just
start my own class.

01:14.583 --> 01:16.375
Helen would never
let you do that.

01:16.375 --> 01:18.208
Helen has no power over me.

01:18.208 --> 01:19.958
I think as the head
of the Wizard Family

01:19.958 --> 01:21.958
Competition Commissioner's
Office, she does.

01:21.958 --> 01:25.875
I just gave you
everything you need to know!

01:25.875 --> 01:27.833
Yes, you did.
You're the best brother ever.

01:27.833 --> 01:29.416

Excuse me, is this
the Family Wizard Competition
Commissioner's Office?

02:29.500 --> 02:31.583
Uh, it's gonna be.

02:31.583 --> 02:33.458
Now, when I got my promotion,

02:33.458 --> 02:37.083
all I asked for was
an aquarium in my office.

02:37.083 --> 02:38.458
And you know what I got?

02:38.458 --> 02:42.083
My office in an aquarium.

02:44.333 --> 02:46.625
Why is that bug-eyed one
looking at us?

02:46.625 --> 02:50.000
He's been giving me
the evil eye since lunch.

02:51.000 --> 02:52.500
I had tuna.

02:54.458 --> 02:57.708
OK, well, my name
is Alex Russo,

02:57.708 --> 03:00.000
and I'm trying to find
a way to catch up

03:00.000 --> 03:01.500
in my family
wizard competition.

03:01.500 --> 03:04.750
Alex Russo.

03:07.625 --> 03:10.000
Oh, based on your lousy record,

03:10.000 --> 03:12.500
you should take a delinquent
class to earn points.

03:12.500 --> 03:16.500
Well, then sign me up.
I am so delinquent.

03:16.500 --> 03:18.583
I turned my dad
into a cockroach,

03:18.583 --> 03:20.833
fed chocolate to
a pocket elf, and...

03:20.833 --> 03:24.875
Well, I'm just gonna say it:
Exposed wizardry to the world.

03:24.875 --> 03:29.875
- That's right. To the world.
- You know, listen, sweetie...

03:29.875 --> 03:33.125
I think it would be
better for everybody

03:33.125 --> 03:36.458
if you just, uh...
quit the competition.

03:36.458 --> 03:41.208
The world needs
fishermen. Huh?

03:41.208 --> 03:44.333
Listen, Helen,
I can't give up.

03:44.333 --> 03:46.583
Being in this competition
is the only way

03:46.583 --> 03:48.583
I'll be able to stay
with my werewolf boyfriend.

03:48.583 --> 03:50.000
Your boyfriend's
a werewolf?

03:50.000 --> 03:53.875
How romantic!

03:53.875 --> 03:55.708
Oh, come.

03:55.708 --> 03:59.583
This is my boyfriend,
Teddy.

03:59.583 --> 04:01.583
He's a cyclops.

04:01.583 --> 04:06.250
I'm the apple of his... eye.

04:06.250 --> 04:08.166
How about if I sign you up

04:08.166 --> 04:10.750
for your brother's
delinquent class?

04:10.750 --> 04:12.750
Now, if you show
a marked improvement,

04:12.750 --> 04:14.208
you could move up a level.

04:14.208 --> 04:16.708
There's only one
tiny problem.

04:16.708 --> 04:19.000
There's no way Justin
will let me in his class.

04:19.000 --> 04:22.000
Ha, sweetie, he can
argue all he wants,

04:22.000 --> 04:24.208
but he can't argue with...

04:24.208 --> 04:27.083
...the official stamp.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.416
OK, everyone
needs to be nice

04:38.416 --> 04:40.291
to the Sophisticated
Wizards Club.

04:40.291 --> 04:42.416
They're an elite group,
and we want Max to get in.

04:42.416 --> 04:43.875
Oh, come on!

04:43.875 --> 04:45.958
"Elite" just means
a bunch of stuck-up snobs

04:45.958 --> 04:47.125
who try to
get by in life with

04:47.125 --> 04:48.958
- their charm and good looks.
- Hey.

04:51.333 --> 04:54.833
Hello, I'm Fidel.
Rack of lamb hat, correct?

04:54.833 --> 04:59.125
What about it,
fancy pants?

04:59.125 --> 05:01.708
Most of the ladies I know
aren't fashion-savvy enough

05:01.708 --> 05:03.875
to wear such a
prime cut of meat.

05:06.875 --> 05:09.208
Oh! Oh, yeah,
don't drink that.

05:09.208 --> 05:10.583
I kind of washed
my feet in it

05:10.583 --> 05:12.708
before I knew
you were so nice.

05:14.958 --> 05:19.291
Mmm! This punch
is delicious!

05:19.291 --> 05:21.333
Back to our discussion
on all things "wand."

05:21.333 --> 05:22.875
Wand etiquette,
wand history,

05:22.875 --> 05:25.833
and alternative uses
of the wand.

05:25.833 --> 05:28.125
Well, how's this for
your wand etiquette, Fidel?

05:28.125 --> 05:30.291
Ah! My brain!

05:30.291 --> 05:33.375
Someone shish-kabobbed
my brain!

05:33.375 --> 05:36.375
I'm just kidding.
I made this wand.

05:36.375 --> 05:38.000
You should've seen
your face, dude.

05:40.125 --> 05:43.750
You should've seen
your face, dude.

05:43.750 --> 05:46.458
Max, we have something
to tell you.

05:47.416 --> 05:49.000
Welcome to the club!

05:50.166 --> 05:52.291
Yes! He's in!

05:52.291 --> 05:55.000
Look at my face now! Look!

05:57.458 --> 06:00.333
Now, the key to
mastering a spell

06:00.333 --> 06:01.875
is focusing
your inner wizard

06:01.875 --> 06:04.416
and summoning all your power.

06:04.416 --> 06:08.375
It's a little something I
like to call using the Force.

06:08.375 --> 06:11.583
The Force? You ripped
that off ofStar Wars.

06:11.583 --> 06:14.083
Or did they
rip it off from me?

06:14.083 --> 06:16.416
And you ripped that off too!

06:17.875 --> 06:19.500
All right, move over,
delinquents.

06:19.500 --> 06:21.708
I'm part of your class now.

06:21.708 --> 06:23.125
What are you talking about?

06:23.125 --> 06:25.083
This is how I'm gonna get back
in the wizard competition.

06:25.083 --> 06:27.291
So, where do I sit?

06:27.291 --> 06:29.375
There's no way I'm gonna
let you in my class.

06:29.375 --> 06:31.958
Come on, Mr. Justin.
Your sister's kind of cute.

06:31.958 --> 06:33.458
Ah, thank you.

06:33.458 --> 06:35.625
No way!
She'll be disruptive,

06:35.625 --> 06:37.250
she'll undermine me,
and I have full authority

06:37.250 --> 06:38.875
to deny her entry. Denied.

06:38.875 --> 06:40.291
I have an enrollment slip.

06:40.291 --> 06:42.500
- That means nothing.
- Check out the stamp.

06:42.500 --> 06:44.833
Not the official stamp!

06:47.208 --> 06:48.583
Take your seat,
Miss Russo.

06:50.708 --> 06:54.291
Apparently,
we have a new student.

06:54.291 --> 06:56.958
Alex Russo.
No one talk to her.

06:56.958 --> 07:00.000
Yeah, no one talk to me.
I'm here to learn.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.291
I really like your boots,
by the way.

07:01.291 --> 07:03.958
What's the difference
between a corn and a bunion?

07:03.958 --> 07:05.500
Can we get back to the
morph spell, please?

07:05.500 --> 07:08.458
Eyes up here. Now, who's
going to morph into...

07:08.458 --> 07:11.083
...let's say,
Shaquille O'Neal,

07:11.083 --> 07:13.500
one of the greatest
footballers ever?

07:14.375 --> 07:16.291
I'll do it!
Ah, look at me.

07:16.291 --> 07:18.166
I'm already
the teacher's pet.

07:18.166 --> 07:19.708
All right.

07:19.708 --> 07:23.708
Morphus morpharium
morfishplease Shaq.

07:23.708 --> 07:26.416
Close.
That's a shack.

07:29.583 --> 07:32.166
Man,
I'm really out of practice.

07:32.166 --> 07:33.750
I do need this class.

07:33.750 --> 07:38.875
Wow. She was even cute when
she looked like an outhouse.

07:43.583 --> 07:47.125
My word,
I'm Professor Crumbs.

07:47.125 --> 07:49.500
I'm as old as dirt,
and I have a family of geese

07:49.500 --> 07:51.000
under my beard.

07:51.000 --> 07:52.958
Just kidding.
There's a chicken!

07:54.708 --> 07:56.500
That's a wonderful
imitation.

07:56.500 --> 07:59.416
I'm so glad you're fitting in
with us sophisticated young men.

07:59.416 --> 08:01.125
Well, I fit in lots of places.

08:01.125 --> 08:02.708
Especially my dad's gym bag.

08:02.708 --> 08:04.750
He uses it when we
go to the movies.

08:06.291 --> 08:10.208
Jerry, when are they gonna
make him more sophisticated?

08:10.208 --> 08:12.083
This is how boys bond.

08:12.083 --> 08:14.000
They break the ice
by joking around,

08:14.000 --> 08:16.500
then they'll get down
to the sophisticated stuff.

08:16.500 --> 08:18.000
Hmm. By the way,

08:18.000 --> 08:20.458
I'm glad you finally found
a good use for your gym bag.

08:24.166 --> 08:27.708
Pardon us.
Can I talk to you?

08:27.708 --> 08:29.500
Looks like you're really
fitting in with everybody.

08:29.500 --> 08:31.708
That's good. But if you
want to learn from these guys

08:31.708 --> 08:34.291
you have to jump in
on their wand discussions.

08:34.291 --> 08:36.333
Yeah, Dad, I got
plenty of wand stories.

08:36.333 --> 08:37.708
Remember that time
I lost my wand,

08:37.708 --> 08:40.958
and we found it a year later
when I got that X-ray?

08:42.708 --> 08:45.375
You don't always have to
start with the first story

08:45.375 --> 08:46.875
that pops into your mind.

08:46.875 --> 08:48.625
OK?

08:48.625 --> 08:52.416
Oh, no. I seem to have
gotten something on my robe.

08:52.416 --> 08:54.291
This is how you charm
your way through life.

08:54.291 --> 08:55.625
Watch and learn.

08:55.625 --> 08:59.000
Excuse me, Harper.

08:59.000 --> 09:01.375
Do you know a facility nearby
that can clean my robe?

09:01.375 --> 09:03.250
Why don't you just
use magic to clean it?

09:03.250 --> 09:05.416
There's no delicate setting
on my wand.

09:05.416 --> 09:08.083
And I like things delicate.
Like you.

09:10.000 --> 09:12.583
Just stop it right now!

09:14.583 --> 09:16.583
OK, give me your robe.
I'll clean it for you.

09:16.583 --> 09:19.750
Excellent. Gents, Harper here
will be cleaning our robes.

09:19.750 --> 09:20.875
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

09:20.875 --> 09:22.458
- Wait a second!
- Yes, wait.

09:22.458 --> 09:24.000
You can't just saddle her
with your robes.

09:24.000 --> 09:26.708
You'll tarnish
her beautiful personality.

09:26.708 --> 09:30.750
Well, I really don't
see the connection,

09:30.750 --> 09:35.500
but it still sounded nice.
All right, load me up, gents.

09:36.875 --> 09:39.291
Why does she have to be
in my class?

09:39.291 --> 09:41.291
I'm gonna take a field trip
to Monkey Island

09:41.291 --> 09:43.750
and leave her there.

09:43.750 --> 09:46.208
Oh, look.

09:46.208 --> 09:49.708
The Sophisticated
Wizards of the World.

09:49.708 --> 09:52.125
You know something,
guys, if I didn't lose
my good standing

09:52.125 --> 09:55.000
in the family competition,
I'd be in your club.

09:55.000 --> 09:56.583
I'd be the president
of your club,

09:56.583 --> 09:58.000
leading vibrant discussions

09:58.000 --> 09:59.833
on commonly mispronounced
spell words.

09:59.833 --> 10:02.500
For instance,
"hocus pocus"

10:02.500 --> 10:05.125
properly pronounced,
"hokoos pokoos."

10:09.000 --> 10:11.708
Sounds like we're
really missing out.

10:15.875 --> 10:19.416
Well, Justin, I'm sure
you're far too busy

10:19.416 --> 10:22.833
being the president of the
"I'm losing the wizard
competition club."

10:22.833 --> 10:24.083
Now, why don't you
go have a meeting.

10:27.458 --> 10:28.750
Enjoy this
while you can, Max,

10:28.750 --> 10:30.000
because I'm gonna
catch up to you,

10:30.000 --> 10:32.458
and then I'm gonna take
your spot in this... club.

10:32.458 --> 10:34.875
And then you can take my spot
in my loser club.

10:34.875 --> 10:36.958
That I don't have!

10:44.083 --> 10:46.125
Max, we may have
a problem.

10:46.125 --> 10:48.291
Justin's not going to
give up on the competition.

10:48.291 --> 10:50.958
I know. Why does he
want to win it so bad?

10:50.958 --> 10:55.166
It's just a fantastic life
of unlimited powers.

10:55.166 --> 10:56.833
We like having you, Max.

10:56.833 --> 10:58.333
We don't want Justin
in the club.

10:58.333 --> 11:01.291
He'll try to take my place
as president,

11:01.291 --> 11:04.500
and your brother
is much too stodgy.

11:04.500 --> 11:06.375
Fidel, he's not stodgy.

11:06.375 --> 11:10.333
He may be uninteresting,
formal, really boring...

11:10.333 --> 11:12.333
Definitely
not stodgy, though.

11:16.000 --> 11:18.083
We cannot lose
this delightful fellow.

11:18.083 --> 11:19.458
He's our own personal buffoon.

11:22.625 --> 11:24.625
Listen, Max,

11:24.625 --> 11:27.083
I'm going to let you in
on a little known rule.

11:27.083 --> 11:28.833
When you're this far ahead
of your siblings,

11:28.833 --> 11:30.750
you're permitted to move up
the family wizard competition

11:30.750 --> 11:32.458
to whatever date you want.

11:32.458 --> 11:35.000
You might as well do it now,
before Justin catches up to you.

11:35.000 --> 11:36.708
You're right.

11:36.708 --> 11:39.000
The sooner I win,
the sooner I can use magic

11:39.000 --> 11:41.625
to make big legs and only
take two steps to school.

11:41.625 --> 11:45.458
The laughs
never stop with you.

11:49.000 --> 11:51.500
Alex, why are you
wasting my time?

11:51.500 --> 11:53.500
You were supposed to
turn into Justin Bieber,

11:53.500 --> 11:56.500
not just a beaver.

11:56.500 --> 11:59.375
What went wrong?
I said the spell correctly.

12:01.833 --> 12:04.333
You were just going
through the motions.

12:04.333 --> 12:06.833
You gotta focus
your inner wizard

12:06.833 --> 12:08.333
and summon all your powers.

12:08.333 --> 12:09.875
It can't just be
90 percent spell,

12:09.875 --> 12:12.291
and 10 percent "Ooh, what's
going on for TV tonight?"

12:12.291 --> 12:15.291
Well, at eight o'clock, it's
Kicked in Hysterical Places,

12:15.291 --> 12:17.708
- then at nine...
- See?

12:17.708 --> 12:22.583
- There's no helping you.
- Come on, Justin.

12:22.583 --> 12:26.333
Please, I need to make
a comeback in this competition.

12:26.333 --> 12:28.250
And, hey,
if I do better,

12:28.250 --> 12:30.125
that means you've helped
another delinquent wizard,

12:30.125 --> 12:31.875
and that helps you, too.

12:31.875 --> 12:33.958
You're right.

12:33.958 --> 12:36.291
Maybe in a year we'll
have enough points
to catch up to Max.

12:36.291 --> 12:40.208
All we need is a little time
to raise our standings.

12:41.833 --> 12:44.250
Hey, guys. So I moved up
the final wizard competition

12:44.250 --> 12:45.750
to Monday at 4pm.

12:45.750 --> 12:47.708
Let's just get this thing
done, right?

12:49.125 --> 12:50.291
What?!

12:53.875 --> 12:56.083
I can't believe that
Max moved up the final

12:56.083 --> 12:58.583
wizard competition.
Is that even legal?

12:58.583 --> 13:00.458
Yeah, the competition code
clearly states it.

13:00.458 --> 13:03.208
Only Max can
change the date back.

13:03.208 --> 13:05.458
OK, don't worry about it.
I'll...

13:05.458 --> 13:06.750
I'll go talk to him.
I can reason with him.

13:06.750 --> 13:09.083
- Say that last sentence again.
- I can reason with him.

13:10.583 --> 13:13.250
I will distract him
with something shiny.

13:18.375 --> 13:21.250
If Max is the only one
that can change the date back,

13:21.250 --> 13:23.291
then that's what he's gonna do.

13:23.291 --> 13:27.500
All right, concentrate.
Pull my powers together.

13:27.500 --> 13:30.708
Morphus morpharium
morfishplease Max.

13:32.083 --> 13:34.750
Whoa. I did
the spell so well,

13:34.750 --> 13:37.583
I'm even itchy in a lot
of weird places, just like Max.

13:47.291 --> 13:50.166
Harper, you're not ironing

13:50.166 --> 13:52.208
all of their wizard robes,
are you?

13:53.625 --> 13:56.166
I think these boys are
taking advantage of you.

13:56.166 --> 13:58.000
They're not taking
advantage of me.

13:58.000 --> 13:59.500
They're paying me.

13:59.500 --> 14:02.583
In compliments.

14:04.208 --> 14:06.750
Listen, kid, you should be
ashamed of yourself

14:06.750 --> 14:09.416
- for taking advantage of...
- Your lovely home?

14:09.416 --> 14:11.958
Thank you for letting
our group meet here.

14:11.958 --> 14:14.250
It's as beautiful
as your personality.

14:14.250 --> 14:17.208
Oh! Thank you, Fidel.

14:19.000 --> 14:24.708
Well, then, make yourself
at home in my lovely home.

14:24.708 --> 14:25.875
Excuse me.

14:28.416 --> 14:29.583
See what I told you?

14:29.583 --> 14:31.416
They want to serve us,
they just don't know it.

14:31.416 --> 14:35.083
Hey, um, I heard you
talking to Mrs. Russo.

14:35.083 --> 14:36.583
Are you taking
advantage of me?

14:36.583 --> 14:39.250
Because I'm the one with the
beautiful personality, not her.

14:39.250 --> 14:42.875
Harper, you both have equally
beautiful personalities.

14:42.875 --> 14:46.875
How does one compare
a sunset to a rainbow?

14:52.000 --> 14:54.458
Yep, he's taking
advantage of me.

14:56.291 --> 14:58.208
Huh.

14:59.458 --> 15:02.000
All right, sophisticates.

15:02.000 --> 15:03.958
Time to go out to the terrace
for a breath of fresh air,

15:03.958 --> 15:05.583
and some
scintillating conversation

15:05.583 --> 15:07.958
about the evolution
of the wand.

15:07.958 --> 15:10.250
Oh, cool, I know
a lot about wands.

15:10.250 --> 15:12.958
Oh, this should be funny.

15:12.958 --> 15:16.833
Did you guys know that
if you sit down with a wand
in your pocket, it breaks?

15:16.833 --> 15:17.958
Then you can
order a new one,

15:17.958 --> 15:20.208
but it takes six
to eight weeks to arrive.

15:22.125 --> 15:25.375
Wow, that wasn't
very funny at all.

15:25.375 --> 15:27.458
I wasn't really
trying to be funny.

15:27.458 --> 15:30.125
I was being scintillating.

15:32.958 --> 15:34.750
You know, Max,
you don't need to worry

15:34.750 --> 15:36.708
about all of the
club discussions.

15:36.708 --> 15:39.833
Why don't you stay here
and finish preparing
your watermelon shoes?

15:39.833 --> 15:42.125
That's a better use
of everyone's time.

15:46.083 --> 15:49.458
Max, what was that
all about?

15:49.458 --> 15:50.958
I don't know.

15:50.958 --> 15:54.458
I guess they're just
really excited to see
my watermelon shoes.

15:54.458 --> 15:57.458
Dad, Max changed the wizard
competition to Monday.

15:57.458 --> 15:59.625
Now, Alex and I have
no chance of catching up.

15:59.625 --> 16:01.416
- You did what?!
- I moved it up.

16:01.416 --> 16:02.875
The club thought
it was a good idea.

16:02.875 --> 16:04.291
Well, change it back.

16:04.291 --> 16:05.708
Look, I came here
to reason with you,

16:05.708 --> 16:08.708
but I will give you
an intimidating stare-down
if I have to.

16:08.708 --> 16:10.875
Justin, I'll handle this, OK?

16:10.875 --> 16:13.500
It was the club's idea?
Why would they do that?

16:13.500 --> 16:15.750
Obvious reasons.
I'm more sophisticated.

16:15.750 --> 16:16.875
You're making
watermelon shoes.

16:16.875 --> 16:18.625
There's nothing sophisticated
about that.

16:20.583 --> 16:23.375
Ha! You blinked!
I win! Yes!

16:23.375 --> 16:25.583
Ha!

16:27.000 --> 16:30.000
Max, I don't like
that the club

16:30.000 --> 16:31.833
had you change
the competition date.

16:31.833 --> 16:34.208
It's not fair to
your brother and sister.

16:34.208 --> 16:35.500
And they're not even
letting you

16:35.500 --> 16:38.166
participate in
their discussions.

16:38.166 --> 16:42.000
I'm starting to wonder why
they even let you in the club.

16:42.000 --> 16:45.583
Well, they like it
when I make them laugh.

16:45.583 --> 16:49.416
Yeah, it sounds like they're
treating you like a clown.

16:49.416 --> 16:51.750
You're right.

16:51.750 --> 16:55.166
I'm not really a member
of this club at all, am I?

16:55.166 --> 16:56.958
I'm sorry, Dad.

16:56.958 --> 16:59.583
I know how much you wanted me
to be a Sophisticated Wizard.

16:59.583 --> 17:01.000
No. No, no, no, no.

17:01.000 --> 17:03.875
I'm the one who should be
apologizing to you.

17:03.875 --> 17:06.500
I don't want you to be
like one of those jerks.

17:06.500 --> 17:09.625
I want you to be just
the way you are, Max.

17:09.625 --> 17:12.583
Look, forget about the club.

17:12.583 --> 17:14.500
Really? Thanks,

17:14.500 --> 17:16.500
'cause I was starting to
run out of funny material.

17:18.416 --> 17:19.833
I'm gonna do
the right thing, Dad.

17:19.833 --> 17:21.083
I'm gonna move
the competition back.

17:21.083 --> 17:23.458
Good for you, Max.
I'm proud of you.

17:23.458 --> 17:26.250
Hey. That's sophisticated.

17:26.250 --> 17:29.125
Before I leave,
can you do me a favor?

17:29.125 --> 17:30.708
Strap on those
watermelon shoes?

17:30.708 --> 17:32.958
The guys are really
looking forward to seeing them.

17:32.958 --> 17:34.833
No problem.

17:34.833 --> 17:37.333
I'll show them the watermelon.

17:40.750 --> 17:43.875
Uh, excuse me?
Sophisticated Club?

17:43.875 --> 17:46.708
Max quits!

17:50.958 --> 17:54.583
Max, I don't understand.

17:54.583 --> 17:58.250
You just had your family's
wizard competition moved up

17:58.250 --> 18:00.583
and now you want to
move it back?

18:00.583 --> 18:02.583
Yeah, it's just
better for people

18:02.583 --> 18:04.291
if they don't try
to figure me out.

18:04.291 --> 18:06.583
And my sister, Alex,
is beautiful.

18:06.583 --> 18:08.958
What?

18:08.958 --> 18:11.416
Nothing. Just wanted
to hear myself say that.

18:14.958 --> 18:17.000
Another Max Russo?

18:17.000 --> 18:19.458
What is going on?

18:25.000 --> 18:26.958
Max, what are you
doing here?

18:28.625 --> 18:30.875
It's me, Justin.

18:30.875 --> 18:34.291
I came here to change
the competition back to
its original preset date.

18:34.291 --> 18:36.458
Wait. Max.

18:36.458 --> 18:38.750
Girl clothes.
Jewelry. Alex!

18:38.750 --> 18:42.166
Yes, I came to change
the date back, too.

18:42.166 --> 18:44.083
You see, Helen, this was
so important to me,

18:44.083 --> 18:46.458
that I decided to come here
twice to tell you.

18:46.458 --> 18:50.250
Nice to see you again...
Helen.

18:52.000 --> 18:53.333
Helen, I'm here

18:53.333 --> 18:54.875
to change the date
back to...

18:54.875 --> 18:57.833
Hey, what am I
already doing here?

18:57.833 --> 19:00.708
That's what I'd like to know.

19:00.708 --> 19:02.750
Helen, would you
give us a moment?

19:04.000 --> 19:06.125
Max, it's Justin and Alex.

19:06.125 --> 19:08.000
Look, you weren't gonna
change the competition back,

19:08.000 --> 19:09.750
so we had to do something.

19:09.750 --> 19:12.750
So, you turned yourself into me
and went behind my back?

19:12.750 --> 19:15.291
You actually went behind
all three of my backs.

19:15.291 --> 19:18.875
Justin, get him out of here!
You guys are ruining my plan.

19:18.875 --> 19:20.291
It was a dumb plan anyway.

19:20.291 --> 19:22.250
- You had the same plan!
- Right.

19:22.250 --> 19:25.000
You know what? I'm keeping the
wizard competition on Monday.

19:25.000 --> 19:27.708
Nobody imitates me
and gets away with it.

19:27.708 --> 19:30.500
Except for that little guy
I see when I look in a spoon.

19:32.208 --> 19:33.208
What?

19:35.583 --> 19:37.333
Change it back.

19:37.333 --> 19:40.291
That didn't hurt. You should
have thrown that board.

19:56.625 --> 19:59.583
Let go,
this is a new top!

19:59.583 --> 20:01.500
Ugh, your body's sweating.

20:01.500 --> 20:04.083
Gross. Now my shirt
has pit stains.

20:04.083 --> 20:05.875
You guys shouldn't
mess with me.

20:05.875 --> 20:08.250
I know my own weaknesses.

20:15.750 --> 20:19.083
Max?

20:21.708 --> 20:23.583
What?

20:23.583 --> 20:27.375
OK. I have no idea
what just happened here,

20:27.375 --> 20:30.291
- but Monday is off.
- Yes!

20:30.291 --> 20:34.375
The original Russo family wizard
competition date stands.

20:34.375 --> 20:38.291
I think you two Maxes
and the little girl

20:38.291 --> 20:40.083
could use the time
to work things out.

20:42.416 --> 20:44.416
Why did she just say
"little girl?"

20:51.125 --> 20:53.583
Yes, we did it. We got
the competition changed back.

20:53.583 --> 20:55.875
Why did she say
"little girl?"

20:55.875 --> 21:00.000
Uh, we might've accidentally
turned you into a little girl.

21:00.000 --> 21:01.375
What?

21:01.375 --> 21:04.000
Don't worry about it,
I'll change you back.

21:04.000 --> 21:06.500
Here's the brass tacks.
Turn this girl back to Max.

21:13.125 --> 21:15.333
There you go.
You changed back.

21:15.333 --> 21:18.875
You... You really do
look great. You do.

21:18.875 --> 21:21.250
The spell worked
and you look good.

21:21.250 --> 21:23.375
Thank you.

21:23.375 --> 21:25.833
You know, I thought I was
gonna be stuck like that.

21:27.583 --> 21:31.333
Wait, why are
my clothes so baggy?

21:31.333 --> 21:34.458
And why do I have
dainty little hands?

21:34.458 --> 21:37.458
Why is my voice so high?

21:41.208 --> 21:43.958
I'm sure I'm fine.

21:47.333 --> 21:49.583
OK, so, apparently when
Alex and I did our spells,

21:49.583 --> 21:52.083
they collided and
formed a mutant spell.

21:52.083 --> 21:54.583
But, there's a test here
to determine how long

21:54.583 --> 21:56.208
until the spell wears off.

21:56.208 --> 21:59.833
A test? I usually have time
to study before I fail.

22:00.833 --> 22:03.166
Blow into the
Spell Detector.

22:09.875 --> 22:12.708
- What does that noise mean?
- She may be a little girl,

22:12.708 --> 22:16.625
but she definitely has
Max's donkey breath.

22:16.625 --> 22:18.166
OK, so if it's
a church bell,

22:18.166 --> 22:19.875
that means the spell
will last four days.

22:19.875 --> 22:22.000
If it's a drum roll,
that's one week.

22:22.000 --> 22:24.750
If it's a donkey honk,
it's...

22:24.750 --> 22:28.958
...uh, indefinitely.

22:28.958 --> 22:32.333
Looks like you're gonna be
stuck like this for a while.

22:37.208 --> 22:39.000
You stay out of my closet.
