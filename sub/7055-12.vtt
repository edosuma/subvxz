00:02.520 --> 00:03.854
Previously on <i>Fringe...</i>

00:03.922 --> 00:05.280
Clearly I'm in
the wrong place,

00:05.346 --> 00:07.678
and all the people
that I know and love are...

00:07.746 --> 00:08.876
Somewhere else.

00:08.943 --> 00:11.040
You were showing up
in my dreams.

00:11.104 --> 00:12.903
How is that possible when
I'd never even seen you before?

00:12.970 --> 00:14.436
In the dreams,
did you...

00:14.504 --> 00:15.606
feel like you knew me?

00:15.674 --> 00:16.675
Did you feel anything?

00:16.743 --> 00:19.477
You were a stranger,
so what would I feel?

00:19.545 --> 00:21.484
His name is
David Robert Jones.

00:21.551 --> 00:23.617
He was looking for a mineral
named amphilocite.

00:23.685 --> 00:25.017
If you know how
to process it properly,

00:25.084 --> 00:26.250
it can be used
as a power source.

00:26.318 --> 00:28.050
With this stuff, you get
a lot of bang for your buck.

00:28.116 --> 00:29.449
Well, how much bang
are we talking?

00:29.517 --> 00:31.319
Enough to blow a hole
in the Universe.

I love you.

01:03.123 --> 01:04.822
Do you love me?

01:04.891 --> 01:07.426
I do.

01:09.195 --> 01:12.930
Then tell me.
I want to hear you say it.

01:20.603 --> 01:22.003
I love you.

01:48.031 --> 01:49.265
Hey. It's Peter.

01:49.332 --> 01:52.635
I'm sorry. I know it's early.
Did I wake you?

01:52.703 --> 01:54.036
Uh, no, that's okay.
What's up?

01:54.104 --> 01:56.171
Me and Walter
for the last 24 hours.

01:56.238 --> 01:57.338
We've been working
on the machine.

01:57.406 --> 01:59.040
Did you make
any progress?

01:59.107 --> 02:00.341
<i>Yes. I think we</i>
<i>had a breakthrough.</i>

02:00.408 --> 02:02.208
Could be the first step
towards getting me back home,

02:02.276 --> 02:03.576
<i>but...</i>

02:03.644 --> 02:04.644
But...

02:04.712 --> 02:07.546
There's something
I need your help with.

02:09.382 --> 02:10.482
Gently, gently...

02:10.550 --> 02:13.686
The trick is to ensure

02:13.754 --> 02:16.756
optimal heat distribution...

02:16.823 --> 02:20.593
While not allowing
the mixture to separate.

02:22.930 --> 02:24.198
Ah, Olivia,
you're just in time.

02:24.265 --> 02:25.666
What is that smell?

02:25.734 --> 02:28.001
Walter is creating
a new breakfast cocktail--

02:28.069 --> 02:30.304
hot cinnamon roll.

02:30.372 --> 02:32.339
Did you know
that the cocktail

02:32.407 --> 02:34.908
was historically conceived
as a morning beverage?

02:34.976 --> 02:37.945
The etymology of the word
itself, "cocktail,"

02:38.012 --> 02:40.814
comes from
the magnificent rooster,

02:40.882 --> 02:42.883
who announces the dawn
of each day.

02:42.951 --> 02:45.987
What's in it?

02:46.055 --> 02:47.455
Oh, boy.

02:47.523 --> 02:49.290
It's mostly cinnamon schnapps
and butter, but...

02:49.358 --> 02:50.458
<i>Right now</i>
<i>it's mostly butter.</i>

02:50.526 --> 02:54.629
It needs more butter.

02:59.301 --> 03:02.136
You okay?

03:02.204 --> 03:05.273
Yeah, I'm just a little bit
tired--that's all.

03:05.340 --> 03:07.875
Uh, what did you
need my help with?

03:09.644 --> 03:10.911
Peter and I
have completed

03:10.979 --> 03:12.245
the biomechanical interface
for the machine.

03:12.313 --> 03:14.648
The device is
uniquely calibrated

03:14.715 --> 03:17.316
to work only
with Peter's genetic profile.

03:17.384 --> 03:20.920
It uses an organic interface
to transcode

03:20.987 --> 03:23.255
Peter's neural impulses
into command directives.

03:23.323 --> 03:25.790
Just watch.

03:28.494 --> 03:30.228
So you're able
to control the machine

03:30.296 --> 03:31.930
with your thoughts
through this?

03:31.998 --> 03:33.965
That's how I was able to do it
back in my timeline.

03:34.033 --> 03:36.468
And what, you just click
your heels and think of home?

03:36.536 --> 03:38.837
Well, we haven't quite
worked out how that works yet,

03:38.905 --> 03:40.372
but that's kind of
how I ended up here in Oz

03:40.440 --> 03:42.141
in the first place,
so in theory, yeah.

03:42.208 --> 03:44.376
We won't know for sure
until we're able to test

03:44.444 --> 03:45.845
the prototype
on the machine itself.

03:45.912 --> 03:50.816
Which would require
Broyles' authorization.

03:50.884 --> 03:52.117
Now I know why I'm here.

03:52.185 --> 03:53.285
You don't mind
asking him, do you?

03:53.353 --> 03:56.221
No, of course not.
I'll see what I can do.

04:03.895 --> 04:06.530
♪ I... ♪

04:06.598 --> 04:10.000

04:14.773 --> 04:18.274

04:21.612 --> 04:23.147
Yeah,
I can't explain it.

04:23.215 --> 04:24.615
Another one here.

04:24.683 --> 04:25.616
Just stopped working.

04:25.684 --> 04:27.685
Oh, yeah.

04:31.723 --> 04:36.093
Just the lights went out,
and then...just stopped.

04:40.497 --> 04:42.264
Hey, check it out!

04:42.332 --> 04:44.267
Do you see that?

04:44.334 --> 04:45.301
What is that?

04:45.369 --> 04:46.302
Over there.

04:46.370 --> 04:48.270
We got another...

04:54.511 --> 04:56.412
What the hell?

04:56.480 --> 04:58.614
Whoa.

04:58.682 --> 05:00.783
Oh.

05:00.851 --> 05:02.284
Got to be kidding me.

05:02.352 --> 05:07.156
Oh...

05:07.224 --> 05:09.058
Honey, come here.
Come here. Come here.

05:09.126 --> 05:11.461
Yeah.

05:11.529 --> 05:14.331
Can't believe it.

05:16.201 --> 05:18.602
You got service?

05:18.670 --> 05:21.072
Does anyone
have cell reception?

05:21.140 --> 05:22.073
Is your phone working?

05:22.141 --> 05:23.074
Plane just went down.

05:23.142 --> 05:25.644
It might now.
We should call...

Okay.

05:55.414 --> 05:56.448
Welcome to Vermont.

05:56.516 --> 05:57.783
Thanks.

05:57.850 --> 05:59.518
So what brings us here?

05:59.585 --> 06:01.119
Atlantic 591
was passing overhead

06:01.187 --> 06:02.754
when a disturbance
occurred mid-flight.

06:02.822 --> 06:04.623
It appears their electrical
and hydraulic systems failed.

06:04.691 --> 06:05.858
Walter?

06:05.926 --> 06:08.160
I'm sorry.
I can't seem to reach him.

06:08.228 --> 06:09.261
Any survivors?

06:09.329 --> 06:12.398
None. NTSB is currently
working the crash site

06:12.466 --> 06:13.900
<i>about two miles south of here.</i>
Walter...

06:13.968 --> 06:15.235
But we think whatever
caused the crash

06:15.302 --> 06:16.936
originated
in this location.

06:17.004 --> 06:18.738
On what basis?

06:18.806 --> 06:20.273
Approximately
three hours ago,

06:20.341 --> 06:22.008
every vehicle
on this stretch of highway

06:22.076 --> 06:23.409
inexplicably lost power.

06:23.477 --> 06:25.644
Well, it could be
some sort of interference.

06:25.712 --> 06:27.212
<i>Are there any high-frequency</i>
<i>radio towers around?</i>

06:27.280 --> 06:28.447
None.

06:28.514 --> 06:29.915
That wouldn't explain
some of the stranger events

06:29.982 --> 06:31.349
described by witnesses.

06:31.417 --> 06:32.783
Objects suspended
in midair...

06:32.851 --> 06:34.085
<i>Walter,</i>
<i>are you getting this?</i>

06:34.152 --> 06:35.853
Can you hear me?

06:35.921 --> 06:37.488
<i>Walter...</i>

06:37.555 --> 06:38.822
<i>For God's sake, woman,</i>
<i>lower your decibels.</i>

06:38.889 --> 06:42.492
You're here,
in person.

06:42.560 --> 06:44.594
I thought it was
a nice day for a drive.

06:44.662 --> 06:48.098
Well, let's get started,
shall we?

06:48.166 --> 06:50.433
Well done convincing him
to leave the lab.

06:50.501 --> 06:54.304
Don't look at me.
This was his idea.

06:54.372 --> 06:56.506
I guess he finally got
tired of being caged up.

06:56.574 --> 06:57.874
Yeah, it's not
just that.

06:57.942 --> 07:01.545
I mean, he's been much more
open lately, somehow.

07:01.613 --> 07:02.946
<i>Peter!</i>

07:03.014 --> 07:04.014
Look at this.

07:04.082 --> 07:06.250
Walter,
what are you doing?

07:06.317 --> 07:07.384
This car belongs
to someone.

07:07.452 --> 07:10.755
Just watch.

07:10.823 --> 07:12.290
Huh.
It's magnetized.

07:12.358 --> 07:13.591
<i>As I suspected--</i>

07:13.659 --> 07:16.428
I didn't think
that those levitating effects

07:16.495 --> 07:18.029
that the witnesses
described

07:18.097 --> 07:19.464
were the result
of a change in gravity.

07:19.532 --> 07:22.700
<i>On the contrary, it seems</i>
<i>that for a brief moment,</i>

07:22.768 --> 07:24.235
the electromagnetic force

07:24.302 --> 07:26.136
in this area was increased
dramatically.

07:26.204 --> 07:28.638
<i>Which is why all of the cars'</i>
<i>electrical systems failed...</i>

07:28.706 --> 07:30.573
And probably
the plane's as well.

07:30.641 --> 07:31.908
<i>And it was</i>
<i>strong enough...</i>

07:31.976 --> 07:35.011
to leave a residual
magnetic force

07:35.079 --> 07:37.780
in all metal objects
in the vicinity.

07:37.848 --> 07:39.716
Do you have any idea
what caused it?

07:39.784 --> 07:40.917
No. Not yet.

07:40.985 --> 07:42.886
I'll--I'll need to take
some samples

07:42.954 --> 07:44.855
before I can develop
a proper theory.

07:44.923 --> 07:49.193
Um, but I-I-I will require
some of the plane's wreckage

07:49.261 --> 07:50.528
and the black box.

07:50.596 --> 07:54.332
Go ahead and collect
whatever evidence you need here.

07:54.400 --> 07:56.134
<i>Agent Farnsworth and I</i>
<i>will coordinate with NTSB</i>

07:56.201 --> 07:58.670
to take custody
of the wreckage and the bodies.

08:00.339 --> 08:04.342
Peter...

08:04.409 --> 08:06.010
While I'm collecting
the samples,

08:06.077 --> 08:09.379
just down the road,
I saw a sign for a place

08:09.447 --> 08:13.449
that serves delicious
homemade rhubarb pie.

08:13.517 --> 08:15.351
Who's hungry?

08:37.707 --> 08:40.409
There.

08:40.477 --> 08:43.246
<i>"The best in Westfield."</i>
<i>Do you see?</i>

08:43.313 --> 08:44.447
Damn it.
What's up?

08:44.515 --> 08:46.082
I can't get a signal.

08:46.150 --> 08:48.084
I'm gonna hit that pay phone
on the corner,

08:48.152 --> 08:49.919
see if I can get
an E.T.A. from Astrid.

08:49.987 --> 08:51.687
We may have to get
the rhubarb to go.

08:51.755 --> 08:55.057
All right. We'll meet you in there.
Okay.

08:57.327 --> 09:00.696
Come on in out of the cold,
gentlemen.

09:00.763 --> 09:01.697
Have a seat.

09:01.765 --> 09:04.700
<i>What can I get for you?</i>

09:04.768 --> 09:07.203
Your largest slice
of rhubarb pie

09:07.270 --> 09:08.437
and coffee, please.

09:08.505 --> 09:10.840
- All right. And for you?
<i>- Just the bathroom.</i>

09:10.908 --> 09:13.309
Uh, it's in the back there--
first door on your right.

09:13.377 --> 09:14.778
<i>Thanks.</i>

09:14.845 --> 09:16.546
So where you folks from?

09:16.614 --> 09:17.581
Boston.

09:17.649 --> 09:19.349
Ah, it's a lovely city.

09:19.417 --> 09:21.719
Got an Uncle
out in Somerville.

09:21.787 --> 09:23.087
Your first time
in Vermont?

09:23.155 --> 09:25.790
Are we in Vermont?
I had no idea.

09:25.858 --> 09:29.394
- What, you folks lost?
-Not that I'm aware of.

09:29.461 --> 09:31.563
Well, how does a man drive all
the way from Boston to Vermont

09:31.630 --> 09:32.797
and not even know
that he's there?

09:32.865 --> 09:35.301
Oh, I'm not
allowed to drive.

09:35.368 --> 09:36.903
I haven't
renewed my license

09:36.970 --> 09:38.704
since I got out
of the mental institution.

09:43.710 --> 09:45.377
You know what?
I like you.

09:45.445 --> 09:46.980
<i>Pie's on the house.</i>

09:47.047 --> 09:50.516
Oh. Thank you.

10:31.891 --> 10:32.992
Hey.

10:33.059 --> 10:36.562
Looks like June
got you some coffee.

10:36.630 --> 10:37.597
How's your evening going?

10:37.664 --> 10:40.900
Excellent.

10:40.968 --> 10:42.168
And yours?

10:42.236 --> 10:45.004
Just fine.
So what can I get for you?

10:45.072 --> 10:46.239
Pardon?

10:46.306 --> 10:48.507
<i>What do you</i>
<i>want to order?</i>

10:48.575 --> 10:50.709
But...
But I ordered a moment ago.

10:50.777 --> 10:52.944
This is my busiest shift.

10:53.012 --> 10:54.545
Do you want
to order or not?

10:54.613 --> 10:56.480
But I did.

10:56.548 --> 10:58.715
I-I ordered rhubarb pie.

10:58.783 --> 11:02.185
And you even offered
to give it to me free of charge.

11:04.989 --> 11:06.323
Are you trying
to steal food?

11:06.391 --> 11:08.391
No, of course not.

11:08.459 --> 11:09.927
Nobody steals from me.

11:09.994 --> 11:12.362
Not you, not Cliff,
nobody.

11:12.430 --> 11:14.698
You hear me, old man?

11:14.765 --> 11:18.335
I hear you.
I hear you perfectly well.

11:20.972 --> 11:23.507
Oh.

11:23.575 --> 11:25.108
Still got to
get you that pie.

11:25.176 --> 11:27.778
Must've forgot.
I'm sorry about that.

11:42.995 --> 11:43.994
<i>Please...</i>

11:54.272 --> 11:57.508
<i>And there you go.</i>

11:57.575 --> 12:00.744
Anything else

12:00.812 --> 12:02.078
No.

12:36.147 --> 12:38.014
What--what happened?

12:38.082 --> 12:41.084
I don't know, but there's
a guy in the back room.

12:41.152 --> 12:43.086
I think the cook attacked him.
He's pretty beat up.

12:43.154 --> 12:45.321
Thank you.

12:53.164 --> 12:54.632
<i>Come on.</i>

12:54.699 --> 12:56.567
Pulse pressure's weak...

12:56.635 --> 12:59.070
Probably as a result
of the puncture in the arm.

12:59.138 --> 13:00.405
An inch to the right,

13:00.473 --> 13:01.807
it would've hit
his brachial artery.

13:01.874 --> 13:03.641
I just found another body
behind the counter.

13:03.709 --> 13:06.611
- What are you thinking, serial killer?
<i>- I don't know.</i>

13:06.679 --> 13:08.079
I mean, I think there's
something off

13:08.147 --> 13:09.881
about this entire town.
Meaning what?

13:09.949 --> 13:11.350
The whole place
is deserted.

13:11.417 --> 13:12.885
I can't get a cell signal.
All the phone lines are down.

13:12.953 --> 13:15.787
Do I take that to mean that
we can't call for an ambulance?

13:15.855 --> 13:17.456
What, you can't treat
him here?

13:17.524 --> 13:19.058
Well, he's lost
too much blood.

13:19.126 --> 13:20.426
Unless he is
administered fluid,

13:20.493 --> 13:22.394
resuscitation,
and a blood transfusion

13:22.462 --> 13:24.096
immediately,
he may not make it.

13:24.163 --> 13:25.965
Well, the nearest hospital
is 20 miles away.

13:26.032 --> 13:27.333
Then let's get movin'.

13:27.400 --> 13:28.567
Grab his feet.

13:36.409 --> 13:37.843
Where am I?

13:37.911 --> 13:40.346
You've sustained
some injuries.

13:40.413 --> 13:41.581
<i>We're going to get you</i>
<i>to a hospital.</i>

13:41.606 --> 13:42.806
No.

13:43.083 --> 13:45.217
No, we can't leave.
We--we can't leave.

13:45.285 --> 13:46.485
<i>You're going</i>
<i>to be all right.</i>

13:46.552 --> 13:49.220
Stay with us.
What's your name?

13:49.288 --> 13:52.056
Cliff.

13:52.124 --> 13:54.191
Cliff Hayes.

14:00.064 --> 14:01.865
Did you see that?

14:01.933 --> 14:03.467
Yeah,
"Welcome to Westfield."

14:03.535 --> 14:04.793
Y-you must've gotten
turned around someplace.

14:04.818 --> 14:05.636
Yeah, I guess so.

14:05.637 --> 14:06.904
You just got to stay
on the main road.

14:06.972 --> 14:08.239
It takes you right back
to the highway.

14:08.307 --> 14:09.708
Yeah, I-I thought I did.

14:21.622 --> 14:22.989
What the hell
is going on here?

14:23.057 --> 14:24.924
That's not possible.

14:24.992 --> 14:28.194
We can't leave.
We can't leave.

14:28.262 --> 14:30.997
<i>We can't leave.</i>

14:32.566 --> 14:35.768
I think
our friend's right.

14:35.836 --> 14:36.970
We're trapped here.

14:49.240 --> 14:50.740
Hello?

14:50.808 --> 14:51.974
FBI.
Anyone here?

14:52.042 --> 14:54.410
Put him down here,
Peter.

15:00.884 --> 15:02.818
His pulse
is dropping.

15:02.886 --> 15:04.520
Start the blood transfusion
immediately.

15:04.587 --> 15:05.588
With what,
Walter?

15:05.655 --> 15:07.589
Uh, see if you can find
a first aid kit.

15:07.657 --> 15:09.057
There might be
an I.V.

15:09.125 --> 15:11.993
I'm "O" negative,
so I can donate.

15:12.061 --> 15:14.462
Okay, the phones
are out here too.

15:14.530 --> 15:16.264
Walter,
why can't we leave?

15:16.332 --> 15:17.499
Do you think
it's got something to do

15:17.567 --> 15:18.934
with what happened
on the highway?

15:19.001 --> 15:20.202
I'm not sure.

15:20.269 --> 15:21.369
I've seen this
once before.

15:21.437 --> 15:23.271
Where?

15:23.339 --> 15:26.408
<i>Brigadoon.</i>
The musical.

15:26.476 --> 15:29.444
Magical town in the forest
where no one can leave.

15:29.512 --> 15:32.080
Of course, that quaint
Scottish village

15:32.147 --> 15:34.048
was more hospitable
than our present locale.

15:34.116 --> 15:36.050
Come on, Walter.

15:36.117 --> 15:38.919
I haven't formed
a hypothesis at the moment.

15:38.987 --> 15:40.887
My concern is keeping
this man alive.

15:40.955 --> 15:42.356
<i>Found an I.V. kit.</i>

15:42.424 --> 15:46.593
Good.
Put pressure here.

15:46.661 --> 15:47.761
<i>Prepare two needles.</i>

15:49.197 --> 15:51.197
We're not safe here.

15:51.265 --> 15:52.966
<i>This town...</i>

15:53.033 --> 15:56.602
Everyone's crazy.

16:06.980 --> 16:09.448
<i>It started</i>
<i>three nights ago.</i>

16:09.516 --> 16:13.218
My sister woke us up.
She was frantic.

16:13.286 --> 16:15.787
<i>She was so scared.</i>

16:15.854 --> 16:18.222
A man had broken
into her house.

16:18.290 --> 16:21.758
<i>I tried calling the sheriff,</i>
<i>but the phones were down,</i>

16:21.826 --> 16:22.759
<i>so I went over.</i>

16:22.827 --> 16:25.428
When I got there,
I found...

16:27.097 --> 16:30.531
Her husband
in the bedroom...

16:30.599 --> 16:33.398
Shot in the head...

16:33.466 --> 16:35.600
Point-blank.

16:35.668 --> 16:36.601
The intruder killed him?

16:36.669 --> 16:38.470
<i>Not the intruder.</i>

16:38.538 --> 16:41.105
Her.

16:42.708 --> 16:47.243
She said she'd never seen him
before in her life.

16:47.311 --> 16:51.147
They'd been married
for 18 years.

16:51.215 --> 16:54.783
So the effects
are amnesic?

16:54.851 --> 16:55.784
<i>Not exactly.</i>

16:55.852 --> 16:56.952
She was delusional,

16:57.020 --> 17:00.322
she was talking about people
she'd never met...

17:00.390 --> 17:02.557
<i>Things she'd</i>
<i>never done...</i>

17:02.625 --> 17:04.726
<i>Children</i>
<i>she didn't have.</i>

17:04.794 --> 17:07.895
It was
as if she was...

17:07.963 --> 17:09.497
having memories,
all of a sudden,

17:09.564 --> 17:10.964
from someone else's life.

17:11.031 --> 17:12.499
The symptoms
you're describing--

17:12.567 --> 17:15.435
it resembles
schizophrenia.

17:15.502 --> 17:18.304
I know it well.

17:18.372 --> 17:20.271
<i>Except it</i>
<i>wasn't just her.</i>

17:20.339 --> 17:22.441
It was everyone.

17:25.211 --> 17:29.013
So how can
an entire town

17:29.081 --> 17:30.848
turn schizophrenic
overnight?

17:30.916 --> 17:32.350
<i>Some sort</i>
<i>of biological contagion?</i>

17:32.417 --> 17:34.352
Maybe a virus that affects
the human brain?

17:34.419 --> 17:37.388
A virus doesn't explain
why we drive out

17:37.456 --> 17:39.157
one side of town
and right in the other.

17:39.224 --> 17:42.127
Oh, this is
something else.

17:42.194 --> 17:45.530
What else can you tell us
about the symptoms?

17:45.598 --> 17:47.065
Most got sick
right away.

17:47.133 --> 17:49.735
Others took longer,
like, hours, a day.

17:49.803 --> 17:51.037
<i>But it always started</i>
<i>the same way.</i>

17:51.105 --> 17:55.808
First, confusion,
forgetting things...

17:55.876 --> 17:57.176
Tremors.

17:57.244 --> 17:59.011
<i>Some of them</i>
<i>became paranoid.</i>

17:59.079 --> 18:01.314
Others turned violent.

18:01.381 --> 18:04.350
Like our friend
at the diner.

18:04.417 --> 18:05.651
A few of us
who are immune

18:05.719 --> 18:06.886
<i>are holed up</i>
<i>at the high school.</i>

18:06.954 --> 18:09.321
<i>Including my wife</i>
<i>and daughter.</i>

18:09.389 --> 18:12.358
That's why I went to the diner,
to get them food.

18:12.426 --> 18:14.660
They need supplies.

18:14.728 --> 18:17.229
But what they need
most of all is hope.

18:17.297 --> 18:20.532
Knowing that the FBI is here
might give them that.

18:20.600 --> 18:23.835
All right, we need to find
a way to contact Broyles

18:23.903 --> 18:25.536
and let him know
what's going on here.

18:25.604 --> 18:26.837
I did find some radios
out back.

18:26.905 --> 18:28.239
I could try
to send out a signal,

18:28.306 --> 18:29.707
but I'm gonna need
an elevated place

18:29.774 --> 18:31.341
with a clear line of sight and
something to boost the power.

18:31.409 --> 18:32.509
<i>There is a--</i>

18:32.577 --> 18:33.977
an emergency generator
at the high school.

18:34.045 --> 18:36.046
What do you think?

18:36.114 --> 18:39.016
I think we're gonna need
a few things first.

18:39.083 --> 18:42.319
You know, I think
there's a military base

18:42.387 --> 18:43.521
about 50 miles
from here.

18:43.588 --> 18:45.423
You think the army's
involved in this?

18:45.491 --> 18:48.326
I mean, something of this
magnitude--a whole town?

18:48.393 --> 18:50.561
Perhaps it was a military
experiment gone wrong,

18:50.629 --> 18:51.763
like that case
we caught in Edina.

18:51.830 --> 18:53.097
Where's Edina?

18:53.165 --> 18:54.598
<i>Uh, upstate New York.</i>

18:54.666 --> 18:57.702
Remember, the whole town's
population was disfigured

18:57.770 --> 18:59.303
from the military
experiment?

18:59.371 --> 19:00.738
We never had
such a case.

19:02.741 --> 19:04.408
<i>I investigated</i>
<i>a case in Edina</i>

19:04.476 --> 19:06.444
with my Walter
and my Olivia.

19:06.512 --> 19:10.181
Oh, right.

19:10.249 --> 19:11.449
Right, well,
I must've--

19:11.517 --> 19:14.685
I must've read it
in your debrief.

19:14.753 --> 19:17.187
Oh, uh, Peter, now,

19:17.255 --> 19:21.157
now, I don't consider myself
to be a violent man...

19:21.225 --> 19:22.625
Per se,

19:22.693 --> 19:25.428
but given the danger of our,
uh, present predicament,

19:25.496 --> 19:27.630
I think it would be best
if I had one of those.

19:34.939 --> 19:35.905
Pepper spray?

19:35.973 --> 19:40.210
Just remember
it shoots that way.

19:46.051 --> 19:49.387
<i>You ever use a gun?</i>

19:49.455 --> 19:50.422
I'm a teacher.

19:50.489 --> 19:54.592
Okay, red button,
safety.

19:54.660 --> 19:56.094
Come on.

19:58.463 --> 20:01.465
Okay,
let's go.

20:10.407 --> 20:12.342
What's that?

20:12.409 --> 20:14.210
W--
shh, shh.

20:14.278 --> 20:15.445
You guys hear that?

20:31.700 --> 20:33.768
We got to get
out of this town.

20:45.079 --> 20:46.313
Come on.

20:46.380 --> 20:48.982
It won't start.

20:49.049 --> 20:50.516
The increase
in electromagnetism

20:50.584 --> 20:53.853
that caused the cars
to lose power on the highway

20:53.921 --> 20:55.555
must be present
in this town too.

20:55.623 --> 20:57.424
Well, it was working
when we pulled in.

20:57.491 --> 20:58.959
<i>Well, the effect</i>
<i>must be intermittent.</i>

20:59.026 --> 21:00.861
We can wait,
but we have no idea

21:00.929 --> 21:03.430
how long
it will last.

21:08.937 --> 21:11.172
I see the resemblance.
Pardon?

21:11.240 --> 21:13.141
Agent Dunham said his name
is Bishop, like yours.

21:13.209 --> 21:15.443
He's your son,
isn't he?

21:15.510 --> 21:18.312
In a fashion, yes,
you could say that.

21:24.051 --> 21:25.218
You all right?

21:25.286 --> 21:26.820
Yeah.

21:26.888 --> 21:28.588
It's just--
my arm won't stop shaking.

21:28.656 --> 21:29.889
That's all.

21:29.957 --> 21:31.624
Whoa, whoa.
What's the matter?

21:31.692 --> 21:32.892
No, I'm okay.

21:32.959 --> 21:35.294
It's just--
I'm just a little bit dizzy.

21:35.362 --> 21:36.862
You need some water?

21:46.739 --> 21:48.673
Oh, Peter, I don't know
how to explain it,

21:48.741 --> 21:50.575
but that feels like
there was somebody else

21:50.642 --> 21:54.079
in my, uh--
in my head.

21:55.514 --> 21:58.683
Here...

21:58.751 --> 22:00.585
Take this.

22:00.652 --> 22:02.119
I-I-I'm scared that--

22:02.187 --> 22:04.055
that what's happening
to the other people in this town

22:04.122 --> 22:06.090
is happening to me.

22:28.781 --> 22:32.550
Open up.
It's Cliff.

22:39.092 --> 22:40.292
Cliff.
Who are they?

22:40.360 --> 22:41.527
They're FBI,
Brian.

22:41.595 --> 22:43.662
I'll explain
inside.

22:48.869 --> 22:50.804
I thought
you were dead.

22:50.872 --> 22:52.372
What happened?

22:52.440 --> 22:54.241
Long story.

22:54.309 --> 22:55.743
How many people
do you have here?

22:55.810 --> 22:57.545
12 of us made it.

22:57.613 --> 22:59.447
Eleven.

22:59.515 --> 23:00.448
Teresa.

23:00.516 --> 23:02.350
When?
This morning.

23:02.418 --> 23:04.485
Locked her up in one
of the empty classrooms.

23:04.553 --> 23:05.887
Couldn't take the chance
she'd hurt one of us.

23:05.954 --> 23:07.321
Daddy!
Lacey-girl.

23:07.389 --> 23:09.357
Oh, my God.

23:09.424 --> 23:11.225
- I thought you were--
- No, no.

23:11.293 --> 23:15.929
I'm here.
I'm here.

23:15.997 --> 23:17.731
We got to tell Walter.

23:17.799 --> 23:19.433
If you think what's happening
to these people

23:19.500 --> 23:21.034
is happening to you--
<i>so, FBI, huh?</i>

23:21.102 --> 23:23.103
Where's the rest
of you?

23:23.171 --> 23:26.106
Uh, they'll be
here soon.

23:26.174 --> 23:27.441
We've been trapped
here for days.

23:27.509 --> 23:29.210
Our whole damn town's
destroyed.

23:29.278 --> 23:30.545
Our friends,
our families--

23:30.612 --> 23:31.679
everyone's going crazy,

23:31.747 --> 23:33.448
and the U.S. government
sends three people?

23:33.516 --> 23:34.750
Look, I understand
that you have questions,

23:34.817 --> 23:36.018
but all I can tell you
at the moment

23:36.086 --> 23:37.153
is that help
will come.

23:37.221 --> 23:38.622
Now, in the meantime,

23:38.689 --> 23:41.058
we need to work together,
find out what's going on here,

23:41.125 --> 23:42.359
and also
how to get out.

23:42.427 --> 23:43.694
If I could examine
one of the victims,

23:43.762 --> 23:46.230
we might get answers to what's
happening in this town.

23:46.298 --> 23:49.234
I heard that one
of your party went insane.

23:49.301 --> 23:50.601
May I see her?

23:56.542 --> 24:00.579
Teresa.

24:00.646 --> 24:02.447
You're the man
from the government.

24:02.515 --> 24:06.051
You're here
about our air quality.

24:06.119 --> 24:07.686
The air quality's
bad here, isn't it?

24:07.753 --> 24:08.754
Hmm.

24:08.821 --> 24:10.322
May I?

24:14.695 --> 24:15.996
<i>Hmm. Fascinating.</i>

24:16.064 --> 24:16.997
What is it, Walter?

24:17.065 --> 24:19.733
I'll need to take
a blood sample.

24:21.937 --> 24:24.605
The cook at the diner
had two irises in each eye.

24:24.673 --> 24:26.941
<i>Perhaps whatever</i>
<i>is afflicting these people</i>

24:27.008 --> 24:30.378
is creating some sort
of rapid mitosis,

24:30.445 --> 24:32.913
causing the cells
to replicate exponentially,

24:32.981 --> 24:36.517
duplicating body parts.

24:36.584 --> 24:39.052
<i>Mm.</i>

24:45.292 --> 24:48.028
I'm going to ask you
some questions, Teresa.

24:48.096 --> 24:49.162
I should start supper.

24:49.230 --> 24:52.533
Lee's going to be home soon.

24:52.601 --> 24:55.169
H-her husband--

24:55.237 --> 24:58.340
he passed six,
seven years ago.

25:00.810 --> 25:02.644
So when
was the last time

25:02.712 --> 25:05.347
<i>you saw Lee, Teresa?</i>
<i>This morning.</i>

25:05.415 --> 25:08.183
I packed his lunch
before he went to work.

25:08.251 --> 25:10.685
And what did you and Lee
talk about this morning?

25:13.488 --> 25:15.756
Is this a joke?
Some sick joke?

25:15.824 --> 25:16.823
Sorry?

25:16.891 --> 25:20.493
My Lee's dead...

25:20.561 --> 25:23.230
Seven years
this April.

25:28.169 --> 25:29.369
I should start supper.

25:29.436 --> 25:33.640
<i>Lee's gonna be</i>
<i>home soon.</i>

25:33.708 --> 25:34.641
How did it go?

25:34.709 --> 25:36.109
Did you get
the radio to work?

25:36.177 --> 25:37.878
I couldn't get a signal.

25:37.946 --> 25:39.880
Even if I had a generator
twice that size,

25:39.948 --> 25:43.616
there's just too much
electromagnetic interference.

25:43.684 --> 25:45.952
I think we're stuck here
for a while.

25:48.489 --> 25:50.824
What's wrong?

25:50.892 --> 25:52.392
That woman,
Teresa--

25:52.460 --> 25:53.960
her husband died
seven years ago,

25:54.028 --> 25:56.763
and yet she thinks she talked
to him this morning.

26:00.201 --> 26:03.904
Let Walter test
your blood too.

26:03.972 --> 26:06.807
It's the only way
you're gonna know for sure.

26:09.310 --> 26:12.279
They're probably
just psychosomatic--

26:12.347 --> 26:13.613
these things
you're feeling.

26:13.681 --> 26:17.350
You were always very empathetic,
even as a child.

26:17.418 --> 26:19.419
That's why you're such
a great investigator--

26:19.487 --> 26:21.922
you ability to empathize
with the victims.

26:21.990 --> 26:23.357
That's all this is.

26:23.424 --> 26:28.228
A-and if it's something worse,
then we'll deal with it.

26:28.296 --> 26:32.966
Well, I-I need to go
and examine this.

26:42.108 --> 26:44.042
Well, I'm glad
you're here--

26:44.110 --> 26:46.711
not just for me
but for him.

26:46.779 --> 26:49.580
I've seen the way he's been
with you lately.

26:49.648 --> 26:52.584
<i>Before you got here,</i>
<i>he was kind of shut down</i>

26:52.651 --> 26:54.786
and isolated.

26:57.956 --> 26:59.457
He's a lot like my Walter,
this one.

26:59.524 --> 27:01.659
What's she like?

27:01.727 --> 27:02.927
Pardon me?

27:02.995 --> 27:05.329
The other Olivia.

27:05.397 --> 27:06.864
I'm just curious.

27:09.468 --> 27:12.804
I don't know,
she's, uh--

27:12.872 --> 27:14.939
she's driven.

27:15.008 --> 27:17.075
She's very,
very stubborn.

27:17.143 --> 27:19.612
She doesn't like
to lose.

27:19.679 --> 27:22.248
But she sees
the best in people,

27:22.316 --> 27:24.717
even when they
don't see it themselves.

27:24.785 --> 27:26.886
When she first found me,
I was in Baghdad

27:26.954 --> 27:28.588
trying to run a scam on these
two Iranian businessmen.

27:28.656 --> 27:31.090
I didn't picture you
as the scamming type.

27:33.494 --> 27:35.661
That's what made me
so good at it.

27:35.729 --> 27:37.463
Anyway, it was all supposed
to be temporary.

27:37.530 --> 27:39.465
She told me I just had
to babysit Walter

27:39.533 --> 27:41.200
while he was working
on a case for the FBI,

27:41.267 --> 27:43.001
and then after it was done,
I could leave,

27:43.069 --> 27:44.569
go back
to my own life--

27:44.637 --> 27:46.471
despite, of course,
how gorgeous she is.

27:46.539 --> 27:48.873
Well, you've got
good taste.

27:51.944 --> 27:55.346
She gave me something
that I hadn't had since--

28:01.118 --> 28:02.519
really since
my mom died.

28:02.586 --> 28:05.388
She gave me...

28:05.456 --> 28:08.225
A place to call home...

28:08.292 --> 28:11.427
A place I'd want
to call home.

28:13.298 --> 28:16.499
Eventually, we even had
our own thing.

28:16.567 --> 28:17.633
A thing?

28:17.701 --> 28:20.404
Yeah, a thing.
A routine, you know?

28:20.471 --> 28:21.938
On Friday nights,
we'd get together.

28:22.006 --> 28:24.241
We'd watch cheesy horror films
and order in from Damiano's.

28:24.309 --> 28:25.342
You ever been?

28:25.410 --> 28:27.811
No, but I've driven past
on my way home.

28:27.879 --> 28:31.415
It's good.
You should check it out.

28:31.483 --> 28:33.651
Well, she's lucky
to have you.

28:36.121 --> 28:40.091
Oh, my God!
No!

28:40.159 --> 28:41.659
<i>What happened?</i>

28:41.727 --> 28:46.497
<i>I don't know.</i>
<i>I just found her like this.</i>

28:46.565 --> 28:48.165
She got loose somehow.

28:55.107 --> 28:56.740
I don't understand.

28:56.808 --> 28:58.875
She was fine
when we got here.

28:58.943 --> 29:00.977
I mean,
if it happened to her,

29:01.045 --> 29:02.879
what's to say it's not gonna
happen to rest of us,

29:02.946 --> 29:04.614
and why hasn't
anybody come?

29:04.682 --> 29:06.283
We're all gonna be okay.

29:06.350 --> 29:08.285
We just need to figure out
what's happening here

29:08.353 --> 29:10.621
and find out
how to get out.

29:12.424 --> 29:15.293
They shouldn't
even be here.

29:15.361 --> 29:18.063
I'm sorry?

29:18.131 --> 29:21.200
Last fall I was offered
a teaching job in Philadelphia.

29:21.268 --> 29:23.069
Angela wanted me
to take it.

29:23.137 --> 29:25.071
I convinced her
to stay.

29:25.138 --> 29:28.774
I think deep down
I was scared to leave here.

29:28.842 --> 29:30.909
This town is all
I've ever known.

29:30.977 --> 29:34.914
If I had just taken that job,
my family would be safe now.

29:34.982 --> 29:37.683
Maybe.

29:37.751 --> 29:39.785
But you are here,

29:39.853 --> 29:40.853
and if it weren't for you,

29:40.921 --> 29:42.355
they might not
have made it this far.

29:45.226 --> 29:46.459
<i>Will Olivia Dunham and Peter Bishop</i>

29:46.527 --> 29:48.928
<i>please report</i>
<i>to the biology lab at once?</i>

29:48.996 --> 29:51.864
<i>Olivia and Peter</i>
<i>to the biology lab. Thank you.</i>

29:56.003 --> 29:56.970
<i>Peter?</i>

29:57.038 --> 29:59.172
Olivia?

29:59.240 --> 30:01.975
I think I've worked out
what's happened in this town.

30:02.042 --> 30:03.776
When I examined
Teresa's blood,

30:03.844 --> 30:06.245
I found 92 chromosomes
in her DNA.

30:06.313 --> 30:08.748
Well, that's twice
the genetic material

30:08.816 --> 30:10.082
that should appear
in any human being.

30:10.150 --> 30:11.483
Okay, well,
how is that possible?

30:11.551 --> 30:15.521
Belly and I once combined
a tiny portion of our Universe

30:15.588 --> 30:18.191
with the alternate Universe
in a goldfish bowl

30:18.258 --> 30:19.258
<i>in our lab.</i>

30:19.326 --> 30:20.626
<i>Besides...</i>

30:20.694 --> 30:23.263
What it did to the goldfish,
the effect on the physics

30:23.330 --> 30:25.031
in the overlapping areas
was catastrophic.

30:25.099 --> 30:28.168
Gravity,
electromagnetic fields--

30:28.235 --> 30:30.103
Walter, what you're saying is
the two Universes

30:30.171 --> 30:31.938
merged together somehow?
Yeah, I'm afraid I am.

30:32.006 --> 30:33.040
Um...

30:33.107 --> 30:37.145
These two circles...

30:37.212 --> 30:39.714
Represent
the respective Universes.

30:39.782 --> 30:42.217
And this overlap
is the town.

30:42.285 --> 30:44.920
Now, for reasons
that I am yet to deduce,

30:44.987 --> 30:47.589
our Westfield
has merged

30:47.657 --> 30:50.458
with the Westfield
from the alternate Universe,

30:50.526 --> 30:54.662
trapping the three of us
in the overlap.

30:54.729 --> 30:55.963
Okay, well, how can
two universes merging

30:56.030 --> 30:57.431
drive an entire town
insane?

30:57.498 --> 30:58.832
Maybe the same thing
that's happening to the town

30:58.900 --> 31:00.167
is happening
to the townspeople.

31:00.235 --> 31:02.002
They're merging
with their doppelgangers.

31:02.070 --> 31:03.870
Which would explain
why Teresa, uh,

31:03.938 --> 31:06.340
thought her husband was alive
and dead at the same time.

31:06.408 --> 31:09.609
I mean, can you imagine
being flooded with years

31:09.677 --> 31:12.512
<i>of experiences and memories</i>
<i>that were not your own?</i>

31:12.580 --> 31:15.949
The mind--
unable to distinguish

31:16.017 --> 31:17.884
<i>between what's real</i>
<i>and what is not.</i>

31:17.952 --> 31:19.519
Okay, well,
can it be reversed?

31:19.587 --> 31:21.053
Sadly, no.

31:21.121 --> 31:25.225
I am afraid
the damage is done.

31:25.292 --> 31:26.526
So what are you saying,
Walter,

31:26.593 --> 31:29.128
<i>that Olivia's--</i>
What?

31:29.196 --> 31:31.998
No, Olivia's blood
was fine.

31:32.065 --> 31:33.733
Did I fail
to mention that?

31:33.800 --> 31:35.435
Yes, you left
that part out.

31:35.503 --> 31:37.670
Oh, you're--
you're perfectly fine, dear.

31:37.738 --> 31:39.672
<i>Now, as with all of us,</i>

31:39.740 --> 31:41.341
<i>it stands</i>
<i>to reason that Cliff</i>

31:41.408 --> 31:45.178
<i>and the other people here</i>
<i>do not have doppelgangers</i>

31:45.246 --> 31:47.280
at present in the town
in the alternate Universe.

31:47.348 --> 31:49.883
But Cliff said that
he turned down a job offer

31:49.951 --> 31:51.285
in Philadelphia
last fall.

31:51.352 --> 31:52.653
Right, but in the
alternate Universe,

31:52.721 --> 31:54.755
he must've taken the job
and moved his family.

31:54.823 --> 31:56.690
Hey, Walter, could any
of this happen naturally?

31:56.758 --> 31:59.093
I-I-I-I don't see how.

31:59.161 --> 32:02.897
When Belly and I merged just
a tiny portion of the universes,

32:02.965 --> 32:04.732
the energy required
was tremendous.

32:04.800 --> 32:08.068
<i>I-I can't imagine</i>
<i>an energy source</i>

32:08.136 --> 32:09.836
<i>that would merge</i>
<i>an entire town.</i>

32:09.904 --> 32:12.705
What about amphilocite?

32:15.175 --> 32:17.142
Yes, that would do it.

32:17.210 --> 32:19.544
You think that
David Robert Jones is involved?

32:19.612 --> 32:21.513
I don't know, but maybe
that's why he was at the quarry.

32:21.580 --> 32:23.781
Mining amphilocite,
to do this.

32:23.849 --> 32:25.483
But why?
I mean, to what end?

32:25.551 --> 32:27.052
<i>Of course,</i>
<i>if my theory's correct,</i>

32:27.119 --> 32:30.255
it presents
a more pressing problem.

32:30.323 --> 32:32.791
<i>The effects</i>
<i>I have just described--</i>

32:32.859 --> 32:35.127
t-they are
just phase one.

32:35.195 --> 32:37.329
What's phase two?

32:39.433 --> 32:43.636
Agent Dunham,
you need to see this.

33:08.660 --> 33:10.261
That...

33:10.328 --> 33:11.995
is phase two.

33:21.280 --> 33:22.681
<i>Lacey, come on.</i>

33:22.748 --> 33:24.816
Come away
from there, honey.

33:30.255 --> 33:31.822
Daddy,
what's happening?

33:31.890 --> 33:33.124
It's gonna be okay.

33:33.191 --> 33:36.593
Go with mommy.

33:39.230 --> 33:43.466
I just don't know
what to do.

33:43.534 --> 33:46.336
The two towns
have merged together.

33:46.403 --> 33:49.707
They're creating an excess
of mass and energy

33:49.774 --> 33:51.575
in the overlapping regions.

33:51.643 --> 33:54.178
The fundamental forces
of physics are colliding--

33:54.246 --> 33:56.080
out of balance,
destroying everything.

33:56.147 --> 33:57.815
Well, isn't there anywhere
we'll be safe?

33:57.883 --> 34:00.150
No.

34:00.218 --> 34:02.953
Two things cannot occupy
the same space

34:03.021 --> 34:06.758
without
dire consequences.

34:06.825 --> 34:11.329
Both towns will be destroyed
and all of us with them.

34:11.396 --> 34:14.065
There's nothing
we can do.

34:17.202 --> 34:18.835
There's nothing
we can do.

34:27.746 --> 34:29.346
M-maybe you should go
and talk to him.

34:29.414 --> 34:31.315
Me?

34:31.382 --> 34:33.951
Well, I've seen
how you two are together,

34:34.018 --> 34:37.020
and he seems
to respond to you.

34:42.327 --> 34:44.094
Walter...

34:44.161 --> 34:46.665
There must be something
we can do.

34:46.732 --> 34:50.001
You said that the forces
of nature are colliding.

34:50.069 --> 34:52.938
Do you think they could be
offset by opposite forces?

34:53.005 --> 34:55.440
Yes, yes, yes,
yes, yes.

34:55.507 --> 34:57.810
The sum of equal
and opposite vectors is--

34:57.877 --> 35:00.046
is zero.

35:05.518 --> 35:11.023
Very clever, Peter.

35:11.090 --> 35:12.824
We need to find the place

35:12.892 --> 35:15.160
where the opposite forces meet
and cancel out.

35:15.228 --> 35:16.828
Like the eye
of the storm.

35:16.896 --> 35:19.530
In a hurricane, the center
is said to be the safest spot.

35:19.598 --> 35:21.099
And after this thing
is said and done,

35:21.139 --> 35:22.089
it might be the only place
that survives.

35:22.114 --> 35:23.134
Of course.

35:23.135 --> 35:26.671
We need to find the true center
of the merger.

35:26.739 --> 35:28.139
Okay, well, you do that.
I'm gonna get us a ride.

35:28.206 --> 35:29.841
Come on.

35:31.911 --> 35:33.379
Okay, we need to get
to a place

35:33.446 --> 35:35.014
where we're gonna be safe
from the destruction.

35:35.081 --> 35:37.583
- Where?
- We're working on it.

35:37.651 --> 35:40.020
But we're gonna need vehicles
to transport us there.

35:40.087 --> 35:42.689
Now, we know that the phenomenon
affects electronics,

35:42.757 --> 35:45.692
so any fuel-injected engines
won't work.

35:45.760 --> 35:49.796
We need older cars, uh, any
running models from the 1970s--

35:49.864 --> 35:52.800
two, maybe three
to transport everyone safely.

35:52.867 --> 35:54.434
I might have
a better idea.

35:54.502 --> 35:58.505
We left town here.

35:58.572 --> 36:01.674
And we entered
for the first time here.

36:01.742 --> 36:03.776
And Cliff said the first
building to fall was the bank

36:03.844 --> 36:06.045
here on river
and highway.

36:06.113 --> 36:08.481
Right. So, in order
to find the bull's-eye...

36:08.549 --> 36:09.750
Connect the points.

36:09.817 --> 36:13.354
Divide in half.

36:13.422 --> 36:15.156
Construct
the perpendicular bisectors.

36:15.223 --> 36:16.591
And extend
to their intersection--

36:16.659 --> 36:20.496
in the center here.

36:20.563 --> 36:22.531
Cypress and Quimby.

36:24.734 --> 36:26.602
We think the center's
gonna be right there.

36:26.669 --> 36:28.971
"Cypress and Quimby."

36:29.038 --> 36:31.106
That looks about four miles
from here.

36:31.174 --> 36:32.975
If Peter's theory
is correct,

36:33.042 --> 36:35.877
it will be the only thing left
standing when the town

36:35.945 --> 36:38.914
collapses upon itself.

36:38.981 --> 36:41.750
Need a ride?

36:41.817 --> 36:42.951
It's okay.
It's okay.

36:43.018 --> 36:45.320
Daddy won't let anything
happen to you. Go ahead.

36:45.388 --> 36:47.055
Mommy.

36:47.123 --> 36:48.990
Okay.
Where am I going?

36:49.058 --> 36:51.426
Okay, uh,
Cypress and Quimby.

36:51.493 --> 36:52.427
- Do you know that?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

36:52.494 --> 36:54.629
<i>There's a bike shop there.</i>

36:54.697 --> 36:55.997
Don't cry, dear.

36:56.065 --> 36:59.367
We're going
to a safe place.

36:59.435 --> 37:01.469
We'll be fine.
You'll see.

37:04.507 --> 37:06.708
Peter!

37:21.056 --> 37:23.491
Nice shot.

37:28.897 --> 37:29.864
Okay,
is everyone all right?

37:29.931 --> 37:32.600
I think we better
get moving.

37:32.668 --> 37:34.802
Okay.

37:47.322 --> 37:48.322
We did it.

38:00.434 --> 38:03.537
Well, that's not moving!

38:04.872 --> 38:07.007
Okay, everyone,
we're on foot from here!

38:07.075 --> 38:11.746
Make sure
you stay together.

38:11.813 --> 38:14.081
Come on, run!

38:17.653 --> 38:20.021
Go, go, go!

38:22.291 --> 38:23.424
That the last of them?
Yes.

38:23.492 --> 38:26.093
Come on!

38:29.831 --> 38:33.533
Daddy!

38:33.601 --> 38:36.369
<i>Let's go, let's go!</i>

38:36.437 --> 38:39.505
Everybody inside!

38:44.945 --> 38:47.079
Walter, what are you doing?
Come on, get inside.

38:47.147 --> 38:49.515
Peter.
Peter, you were right.

38:49.583 --> 38:51.584
This is it.
This is the eye of the storm.

38:51.652 --> 38:53.186
Great.

39:00.628 --> 39:01.995
We'll be fine.

39:02.063 --> 39:03.897
We--we'll be safe here.

39:07.202 --> 39:08.669
<i>Daddy, I'm scared.</i>

39:08.737 --> 39:10.638
<i>So loud.</i>

40:01.286 --> 40:02.587
Understood.

40:02.654 --> 40:06.424
Coordinate with C.O.C. and
keep me apprised of any changes.

40:06.492 --> 40:07.459
Anything?

40:07.526 --> 40:09.394
Search teams
just checked in.

40:09.462 --> 40:10.762
They scanned
the entire area.

40:10.830 --> 40:12.531
No other survivors.

40:12.599 --> 40:14.900
- And it gets worse.
- How?

40:14.968 --> 40:17.270
During the search, we found
several unusual devices.

40:17.338 --> 40:19.039
We're not sure
how the technology works,

40:19.106 --> 40:20.807
but they were placed around
the perimeter of the town.

40:20.875 --> 40:22.943
David Robert Jones.

40:23.011 --> 40:24.978
Hazmat detected trace amounts
of amphilocite.

40:25.046 --> 40:26.713
What would David Robert Jones
have to gain

40:26.781 --> 40:27.981
by destroying a town

40:28.049 --> 40:29.649
that people didn't even
know was here to begin with?

40:29.717 --> 40:31.084
I don't know.

40:31.151 --> 40:33.218
But the amount of amphilocite
recovered from those devices

40:33.286 --> 40:36.055
is only a fraction
of Jones' stockpile.

40:36.122 --> 40:38.256
Sir, we've got
Director Norris.

40:38.324 --> 40:39.724
Go home.

40:39.792 --> 40:42.126
I can take it
from here.

40:48.568 --> 40:50.269
Hey.

40:50.336 --> 40:54.240
How is Lacey
holding up?

40:54.308 --> 40:56.309
It's just a sprain.
She's fine.

40:56.376 --> 40:57.944
She's strong.

40:58.012 --> 41:00.280
<i>And how are you?</i>

41:03.151 --> 41:05.419
My home...

41:05.487 --> 41:07.054
everything
I've ever known--

41:07.122 --> 41:09.289
how did they
just disappear?

41:09.357 --> 41:11.258
I wish I knew.

41:11.326 --> 41:12.526
Even if you did,

41:12.594 --> 41:14.028
you probably wouldn't be
able to tell me, right?

41:14.096 --> 41:17.932
The Bureau is gonna help you
with temporary housing

41:18.000 --> 41:21.703
until you get back
on your feet.

41:24.541 --> 41:25.808
Well, we have each other.

41:25.876 --> 41:29.679
No matter what happens,
we'll face it together.

41:46.465 --> 41:48.799
Beautiful.

41:51.503 --> 41:53.069
See you tomorrow.

41:53.137 --> 41:54.671
You're leaving?

41:54.739 --> 41:56.406
<i>But I-I've made crepes--</i>

41:56.474 --> 41:57.707
<i>breakfast for dinner.</i>

41:57.775 --> 41:59.909
Second most important meal
of the day.

41:59.977 --> 42:02.912
- I'm sorry, Walter.
- I didn't know.

42:02.980 --> 42:04.447
- Will you take a rain check?
- Of course.

42:04.515 --> 42:05.748
First thing tomorrow morning,
I promise.

42:05.816 --> 42:07.850
And maybe by that time
Broyles will have allowed

42:07.918 --> 42:09.085
us access
to the machine.

42:09.153 --> 42:10.587
Oh, yes.

42:10.654 --> 42:13.990
We can resume our efforts
to get you home.

42:15.960 --> 42:17.828
<i>Peter...</i>

42:21.199 --> 42:22.399
Good night.

42:22.467 --> 42:24.902
Good night,
Walter.

42:51.463 --> 42:53.064
Hey, come in.

42:53.131 --> 42:54.465
Hey.

42:54.533 --> 42:55.900
I hope you don't mind.
I was just in the neighborhood.

42:55.967 --> 42:57.235
Thought I'd stop by
to see how you're feeling.

42:57.302 --> 42:58.503
No, why would I?

42:58.571 --> 43:01.406
I'm gonna pour you
a drink.

43:01.474 --> 43:03.442
What is that
that smells so fantastic?

43:03.509 --> 43:04.743
What do you mean?

43:04.811 --> 43:07.346
It's Friday.
I ordered Famiano's.

43:07.413 --> 43:09.581
W-whoa.

43:09.649 --> 43:11.115
Olivia.
