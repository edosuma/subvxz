WEBVTT

00:10.567 --> 00:12.200
MR. WILLIAMS...

00:12.200 --> 00:13.700
THERE YOU ARE.

00:13.700 --> 00:14.700
WHOA, BROTHER.

00:14.700 --> 00:16.400
A GIFT FOR MAKING IT

00:16.400 --> 00:18.400
THROUGH MY FIRST
WEEK, HUH?

00:18.400 --> 00:20.000
ACTUALLY,
THESE GIFT BASKETS

00:20.000 --> 00:21.233
ARE FROM MISGUIDED SENIORS

00:21.233 --> 00:24.300
TRYING TO GET
COLLEGE RECOMMENDATIONS.

00:24.300 --> 00:28.133
KIWI AND MANGO,
TOBLERONE...

00:28.133 --> 00:31.734
BELUGA CAVIAR--
HEY, MAN, THANKS.

00:32.800 --> 00:33.800
DON'T GET TOO ATTACHED.

00:33.800 --> 00:36.567
YOU'RE TAKING THEM
AS FAR AS MY CAR.

00:36.567 --> 00:37.567
HERE.

00:37.567 --> 00:40.300
IT'S GOOD TO BE YOU,
ISN'T IT?

00:40.300 --> 00:43.834
I DELIVER THESE
TO HOMELESS SHELTERS.

00:43.834 --> 00:45.967
RIGHT.

00:47.033 --> 00:48.300
DROP THAT MANGO, MAN!

00:48.300 --> 00:53.200
BOY, WHAT SOME KIDS WILL DO
TO GET INTO COLLEGE, HUH?

00:53.200 --> 00:54.300
SAVE YOUR MONEY.

00:54.300 --> 00:56.200
THEY HAVEN'T BUILT
A FRUIT BASKET

00:56.200 --> 00:57.667
BIG ENOUGH
TO SWAY ME.

00:57.667 --> 01:00.066
I WOULDN'T THINK OF IT,
MR. FEENY.

01:00.066 --> 01:01.834
FURTHEST THING
FROM MY MIND.

01:01.834 --> 01:04.967
RIGHT THERE, NEXT TO
YOUR SCHOOLWORK, HUH?

01:04.967 --> 01:07.033
YOU STOP THAT!

01:14.667 --> 01:16.300
MR. MATTHEWS...

01:16.300 --> 01:19.200
WHERE DID YOU GET
THAT PAPAYA?

01:20.600 --> 01:21.600
FROM HOME.

01:21.600 --> 01:23.467
IS THERE A PROBLEM?

01:23.467 --> 01:27.000
I'VE GOT MY EYE ON YOU.

01:27.000 --> 01:28.100
HEY, GEORGE, WHAT'S UP?

01:28.100 --> 01:30.767
I WANTED TO BE SURE
YOU KNEW THE HUNTER BOY

01:30.767 --> 01:33.000
MISSED HIS HISTORY TEST
THIS MORNING.

01:33.000 --> 01:34.033
HE WHAT?

01:34.033 --> 01:36.400
MY FAULT.
I WAS SUPPOSED
TO TELL YOU

01:36.400 --> 01:39.767
THAT SHAWN HAD
A SEVERE CASE OF,
UH...

01:39.767 --> 01:42.000
HELP ME OUT HERE.

01:43.033 --> 01:44.033
SLOTH?

01:44.033 --> 01:47.734
YES!
HONG KONG SLOTH.

01:47.734 --> 01:49.400
THAT'S IT.

01:50.900 --> 01:54.700
NOT YOUR BEST WORK,
MR. MATTHEWS.

01:56.100 --> 01:57.400
HUNTER!

01:58.500 --> 01:59.667
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

01:59.667 --> 02:00.934
YOU'RE JUST IN TIME.

02:00.934 --> 02:03.734
I'M ORDERING
<i>FORREST GUMP </i>
ON PAY-PER-VIEW.

02:03.734 --> 02:04.900
MISS ANOTHER DAY
OF SCHOOL,

02:04.900 --> 02:06.600
<i>YOU ARE</i>
<i>FORREST GUMP.</i>

02:06.600 --> 02:09.133
COOL, HE'S DONE
ALL RIGHT FOR HIMSELF.

02:09.133 --> 02:11.600
HE DOESN'T EXIST,
LIKE YOU IN SCHOOL.

02:11.600 --> 02:14.600
YOU KNOW, YOU MISSED
A HISTORY TEST.

02:14.600 --> 02:16.000
THAT WAS TODAY?

02:16.000 --> 02:17.567
BOY, THAT WORKED OUT.

02:17.567 --> 02:18.600
I GIVE UP, HUNTER.

02:18.600 --> 02:20.300
I GOT
TOO MUCH GOING ON

02:20.300 --> 02:22.000
TO KEEP TRYING
TO FIGURE YOU OUT.

02:22.000 --> 02:24.600
TOMORROW MORNING
YOU'RE SEEING
A GUIDANCE COUNSELOR.

02:24.600 --> 02:26.000
OOH, I DON'T
THINK SO, JOHN.

02:26.000 --> 02:30.667
MY PEOPLE ARE CELEBRATING
A VERY IMPORTANT HOLIDAY
TOMORROW.

02:31.734 --> 02:33.467
WHAT PEOPLE
WOULD THAT BE?

02:33.467 --> 02:34.767
WELL...

02:34.767 --> 02:38.800
WE'RE STAYING HOME TOMORROW
TO COME UP WITH A NAME.

02:41.967 --> 02:45.300
HONG KONG SLOTH?

02:45.300 --> 02:47.867
WELL, FEENY CAME UP
WITH THE SLOTH,

02:47.867 --> 02:50.767
BUT I ADDED
THE HONG KONG PART.

02:50.767 --> 02:52.900
TURNER DIDN'T EVEN
WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT.

02:52.900 --> 02:55.100
HE'S ALL, "HUNTER,
TOMORROW YOU'RE SEEING

02:55.100 --> 02:56.600
THE NEW
GUIDANCE COUNSELOR."

02:56.600 --> 02:58.500
I'LL TELL YOU
ONE THING, THOUGH.

02:58.500 --> 02:59.200
SHAWN HUNTER
IS NOT GOING TO WASTE

02:59.200 --> 03:01.100
AN HOUR OF HIS LIFE
LISTENING TO SOME

03:01.100 --> 03:04.600
BALD-HEADED, LONGWINDED,
LEISURE-SUIT-WEARING
KNOW-IT-ALL--

03:04.600 --> 03:07.600
OH! MY NAME'S
ON THE DOOR!

03:07.600 --> 03:11.400
THEY DIDN'T
HAVE TO DO THAT!

03:11.400 --> 03:13.700
YOU'RE THE NEW
GUIDANCE COUNSELOR?

03:13.700 --> 03:15.667
HI. I'M DEVON COLLINS.

03:15.667 --> 03:17.300
HI. SHAWN HUNTER.

03:17.300 --> 03:19.400
GUIDE ME.

03:22.467 --> 03:25.834
MATTHEWS, YOU'RE LOOKING
LIKE COLLEGE MATERIAL.

03:25.834 --> 03:27.200
HERE'S YOUR MONEY.

03:27.200 --> 03:28.567
CAN I PAT HIM DOWN?

03:28.567 --> 03:30.500
MAYBE LATER, FRANKIE.

03:30.500 --> 03:32.867
O.K.

03:36.100 --> 03:40.000
I BELIEVE YOU'LL
FIND IT FLAWLESS.

03:40.000 --> 03:41.767
AH, FEENY'S
STATIONERY.

03:41.767 --> 03:45.500
WHITE AS SNOW, READY FOR
ANY COLLEGE RECOMMENDATION
YOU CARE TO WRITE YOURSELF.

03:45.500 --> 03:47.934
NOW CAN I PAT HIM DOWN?

03:47.934 --> 03:50.967
FRANKIE, I'M DOING
BUSINESS HERE.

03:50.967 --> 03:52.600
FINE!

03:53.967 --> 03:56.567
HOW DID YOU
GET YOUR HANDS ON
FEENY'S STATIONERY?

03:56.567 --> 04:00.400
LET'S JUST SAY
IT FELL OFF A TRUCK.

04:01.600 --> 04:04.000
OH, I'M GOING TO NEED
A FEENY ENVELOPE.

04:04.000 --> 04:05.233
FRANKIE?

04:05.233 --> 04:06.467
TUESDAY.
TUESDAY.

04:06.467 --> 04:07.900
TUESDAY.

04:10.133 --> 04:11.834
FRANKIE! FRANKIE!

04:11.834 --> 04:14.000
OH, GRIFF, OUR LEADER.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.000
EVERYTHING'S FINE.

04:15.000 --> 04:17.233
WHY WOULD YOU THINK
OTHERWISE?

04:17.233 --> 04:19.000
JOEY,
WHENEVER I SEE YOU,

04:19.000 --> 04:22.667
THE PHRASE
"SMALL DOSES"
COMES TO MIND.

04:23.867 --> 04:25.033
FRANKIE, MAJOR NEWS.

04:25.033 --> 04:27.000
THERE I WAS,
SURFING THE INTERNET--

04:27.000 --> 04:28.567
YOU KNOW, VERBALLY
POUNDING PEOPLE--

04:28.567 --> 04:30.667
AND I GOT THIS MESSAGE
FROM HARLEY.

04:30.667 --> 04:31.734
HARLEY KINER?

04:31.734 --> 04:35.400
OR AS HE'S KNOWN
ON THE NET...HARLKINE.

04:35.400 --> 04:37.900
HE'S GETTING OUT,
FRANKIE.

04:37.900 --> 04:42.000
OUR HARLEY,
A REFORM SCHOOL
GRADUATE.

04:42.000 --> 04:44.033
I'M BRIMMING WITH PRIDE.

04:44.033 --> 04:45.500
WELL, SAVE IT.

04:45.500 --> 04:48.367
HE'S BUSTING OUT
IN A SHIPMENT OF LAUNDRY
NEXT WEEK.

04:48.367 --> 04:49.567
I SEE NOTHING
BUT GOOD HERE.

04:49.567 --> 04:52.767
OUR OLD LEADER HARLEY
CAN MEET OUR NEW LEADER GRIFF.

04:52.767 --> 04:55.500
THEY CAN BOND AND BECOME
THE BEST OF...

04:55.500 --> 04:56.867
OOH...

04:56.867 --> 05:01.367
SO, SHAWN,
TELL ME WHAT YOUR LAST
GUIDANCE COUNSELOR SAID.

05:01.367 --> 05:03.200
THIS IS MY FIRST TIME.

05:03.200 --> 05:04.300
REALLY? MINE, TOO.

05:04.300 --> 05:07.300
OOPS. I SHOULDN'T HAVE
SAID THAT OUT LOUD.

05:07.300 --> 05:08.934
YOUR SECRET'S
SAFE WITH ME.

05:08.934 --> 05:12.500
NOW, ACCORDING
TO YOUR FILE...

05:12.500 --> 05:14.100
WOW.

05:14.100 --> 05:15.367
I'LL SAVE YOU TIME.

05:15.367 --> 05:16.834
SKIP TO WHERE
YOU TELL ME,

05:16.834 --> 05:19.900
"EDUCATION IS
THE KEY TO A HAPPY
AND SUCCESSFUL LIFE."

05:19.900 --> 05:22.300
IS THAT WHAT
I'M SUPPOSED TO SAY?

05:22.300 --> 05:23.600
EVERYONE ELSE DOES.

05:23.600 --> 05:25.600
WELL,
IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE.

05:25.600 --> 05:27.133
IN MY HOUSE GROWING UP,

05:27.133 --> 05:28.800
ALL MY PARENTS
EVER TALKED ABOUT

05:28.800 --> 05:32.000
WERE THE THREE Ms--
MONEY, MARRIAGE,
AND MORTGAGE.

05:32.000 --> 05:35.000
MY DAD ALWAYS TALKS
ABOUT THE THREE Bs--

05:35.000 --> 05:37.934
[GRUFF VOICE]
BABES, BUCKS, AND BREWSKIS.

05:37.934 --> 05:40.100
YOUR DAD
SOUNDS COLORFUL.

05:40.100 --> 05:43.033
HE WAS THE PHILOSOPHER
OF THE TRAILER PARK.

05:43.033 --> 05:44.367
HE USED TO SAY,

05:44.367 --> 05:48.300
"ONE MAN'S SEPTIC TANK
IS ANOTHER MAN'S OASIS."

05:49.500 --> 05:51.767
BUT I NEVER KNEW
WHAT HE MEANT.

05:51.767 --> 05:53.734
COULD I TAKE A SHOT?

05:53.734 --> 05:56.400
I THINK HE MEANT
WHAT'S GOOD
FOR ONE PERSON

05:56.400 --> 05:58.033
DOESN'T HOLD
FOR EVERYONE.

05:58.033 --> 05:59.734
ALL RIGHT, DAD.

05:59.734 --> 06:02.200
I ALWAYS KNEW HIGH SCHOOL
WASN'T FOR EVERYONE,

06:02.200 --> 06:05.367
'CAUSE NOT EVERYONE'S
GOING TO END UP IN COLLEGE.

06:05.367 --> 06:08.400
SO YOU'RE NOT PLANNING
ON COLLEGE, HUH?

06:08.400 --> 06:10.000
YOU SAW MY FILE.

06:10.000 --> 06:11.000
"WOW."

06:11.000 --> 06:14.033
SHAWN, I FELT
THE SAME, EXACT WAY.

06:14.033 --> 06:16.100
I HATED THE IDEA
OF COLLEGE.

06:16.100 --> 06:18.600
IN FACT,
I TOOK A YEAR OFF

06:18.600 --> 06:20.000
AND TRAVELED
AROUND EUROPE.

06:20.000 --> 06:22.233
EVEN LIVED IN SPAIN
FOR SIX MONTHS.

06:22.233 --> 06:24.300
I KNOW MORE
ABOUT BULLFIGHTING

06:24.300 --> 06:26.600
THAN ANY WOMAN
YOU'LL EVER MEET.

06:26.600 --> 06:28.767
YOU DON'T KNOW
MY AUNT DEBBIE.

06:28.767 --> 06:31.734
THE POINT IS,
I DID END UP IN COLLEGE.

06:31.734 --> 06:34.300
BUT I NEEDED TO LEARN
ABOUT MYSELF FIRST.

06:36.934 --> 06:38.767
GEORGE, GEORGE,
I NEED A FAVOR.

06:38.767 --> 06:41.867
SEND ME A GIFT BASKET,
LIKE EVERYONE ELSE.

06:41.867 --> 06:43.133
HA HA HA!

06:43.133 --> 06:45.233
YOU'RE ON YOUR GAME TODAY.

06:45.233 --> 06:46.367
WHAT IS IT,
MR. WILLIAMS?

06:46.367 --> 06:48.867
MY TV PRODUCTION CLASS,
WE'RE DOING THESE

06:48.867 --> 06:50.400
PRACTICE PUBLIC SERVICE
ANNOUNCEMENTS.

06:50.400 --> 06:51.867
I COULD USE YOUR HELP.

06:51.867 --> 06:55.734
OH, I'M SORRY,
BUT BETWEEN TEACHING AND
ADMINISTRATIVE DUTIES,

06:55.734 --> 06:58.133
I COULDN'T POSSIBLY
FIND THE TIME.

06:58.133 --> 06:59.500
THAT'S TOO BAD.

06:59.500 --> 07:02.400
THE KIDS THOUGHT
YOU WOULD HAVE MADE
THE PERFECT NARRATOR.

07:02.400 --> 07:03.400
OH?

07:03.400 --> 07:05.100
DID THEY REALLY?

07:05.100 --> 07:06.100
YEAH.

07:06.100 --> 07:07.500
BUT IF YOU'RE TOO BUSY--

07:07.500 --> 07:11.300
WELL, NOW, I WOULDN'T
WANT TO DISAPPOINT
THE STUDENTS.

07:11.300 --> 07:14.033
WELL, GREAT.
HERE YOU GO.

07:19.000 --> 07:20.500
MMM!

07:20.500 --> 07:25.000
YOU'RE NOT MARRIED
TO ANY OF THIS, ARE YOU?

07:26.467 --> 07:28.500
YOU SURE THIS
WILL WORK, JOEY?

07:28.500 --> 07:30.200
YEAH.
I E-MAILED THE WARDEN

07:30.200 --> 07:32.233
THAT HARLEY'S BUSTING OUT
WITH NEXT WEEK'S LAUNDRY.

07:32.233 --> 07:35.600
THEY'LL KEEP HIM LOCKED UP
FOR THE NEXT 10 YEARS.

07:35.600 --> 07:36.934
IT'S FOOLPROOF.

07:38.000 --> 07:39.600
HELLO, BOYS.

07:39.600 --> 07:40.867
LET US REVIEW.

07:40.867 --> 07:43.367
NO TIME TO REVIEW.
HARLEY'S HERE.

07:43.367 --> 07:46.600
STANDING IN FRONT OF US
A WEEK EARLY.

07:46.600 --> 07:49.900
YOU THINK I'D GO ON-LINE
WITH MY REAL ESCAPE PLAN

07:49.900 --> 07:51.934
AND TIP OFF MY ENEMIES?

07:51.934 --> 07:52.934
HEH HEH.

07:52.934 --> 07:56.100
AH, ME AND MY BOYS,
TOGETHER AGAIN.

07:56.100 --> 07:57.467
GUYS, COME ON.

07:57.467 --> 07:59.500
IT'S JUST A STUPID RUMOR.

07:59.500 --> 08:00.500
THERE'S A BETTER CHANCE

08:00.500 --> 08:02.867
OF ME RUNNING INTO
THE LOCH NESS MONSTER

08:02.867 --> 08:07.000
THAN EVER SEEING
THAT GREASEBALL HARLEY
HERE AGAIN--

08:10.233 --> 08:13.300
AND HERE I AM
IN SCOTLAND.

08:14.500 --> 08:15.700
BABOON. HEH HEH HEH.

08:15.700 --> 08:18.000
DID YOU GET THOSE
THREATENING LETTERS
I SENT?

08:18.000 --> 08:19.900
YES, I DID.
THANK YOU.

08:19.900 --> 08:22.734
SORRY I DIDN'T ANSWER.
I'VE BEEN BUSY.

08:22.734 --> 08:24.367
HERE'S MY WALLET.

08:24.367 --> 08:25.767
ENJOY.

08:27.200 --> 08:28.867
I STILL GOT IT.

08:28.867 --> 08:30.700
[PAGER BEEPS]

08:31.767 --> 08:33.300
I DIDN'T HEAR NOTHING.

08:33.300 --> 08:36.000
BEEP, BEEP, BEEP?

08:37.100 --> 08:38.834
GRIFF IS PAGING US.

08:38.834 --> 08:39.834
GRIFF?

08:39.834 --> 08:41.367
WHO'S GRIFF?

08:41.367 --> 08:42.667
YEAH, FRANKIE.
WHO'S GRIFF?

08:42.667 --> 08:46.200
YOU GOT A NEW LEADER
OR SOMETHING?

08:46.200 --> 08:49.567
JOEY, JOEY.

08:49.567 --> 08:51.800
THE FIRST THING
YOU SHOULD BOTH DO

08:51.800 --> 08:53.300
IS BE STRAIGHT WITH ME.

08:53.300 --> 08:54.300
TELL ME ABOUT GRIFF.

08:54.300 --> 08:57.033
JUST SOME LEADER WE MET
ON THE REBOUND.

08:57.033 --> 08:58.033
NOTHING SERIOUS.

08:58.033 --> 08:59.467
MAYBE IF YOU
MET HIM...

08:59.467 --> 09:01.600
LET'S SAY
WE MEET TOMORROW.

09:01.600 --> 09:02.867
RIGHT HERE, 12 NOON.

09:02.867 --> 09:05.033
WE CAN GET TO KNOW
EACH OTHER.

09:05.033 --> 09:10.734
MAYBE I'LL GET A CHANCE
TO FIND OUT HIS BLOOD TYPE.

09:12.500 --> 09:15.000
AND YOU WERE WORRIED.

09:20.300 --> 09:22.400
NO, CLOWN, NO!

09:23.500 --> 09:24.500
CORY.

09:25.567 --> 09:26.567
WEIRD DREAM.

09:26.567 --> 09:27.600
SO WHAT'S SO IMPORTANT

09:27.600 --> 09:31.600
YOU HAD TO GET ME UP
AT 5:00 IN THE MORNING?

09:31.600 --> 09:32.934
I'M TAKING OFF, COR.

09:32.934 --> 09:34.700
I WANTED
TO SAY GOODBYE.

09:34.700 --> 09:35.700
O.K. BYE.

09:35.700 --> 09:37.000
NO, REALLY.

09:37.000 --> 09:38.400
I'M LEAVING TOWN.

09:38.400 --> 09:40.867
SHAWN,
I KNOW WHAT THIS IS.

09:40.867 --> 09:42.600
TODAY'S MISS BIRNBAUM'S
BIOLOGY TEST,

09:42.600 --> 09:45.500
AND, SEEING THAT YOU'VE
NEVER MET MISS BIRNBAUM,

09:45.500 --> 09:46.500
YOU'RE DITCHING.

09:46.500 --> 09:48.700
THIS HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH SCHOOL.

09:48.700 --> 09:50.000
THIS IS ABOUT ME.

09:50.000 --> 09:51.834
I'M DOING
A LITTLE TRAVELING,

09:51.834 --> 09:53.367
GETTING
TO KNOW MYSELF.

09:53.367 --> 09:55.700
I CAN'T BE HAPPY
IN SCHOOL

09:55.700 --> 09:57.600
UNTIL I'M HAPPY
WITH MYSELF.

09:57.600 --> 09:59.367
WHERE DID YOU
GET THAT IDEA?

09:59.367 --> 10:00.500
FROM THE GUIDANCE
COUNSELOR.

10:00.500 --> 10:03.033
SO TURNER'S JUST
LETTING YOU TAKE OFF?

10:03.033 --> 10:05.100
I DON'T WANT HIM
TO FIND OUT.

10:05.100 --> 10:06.367
HE'D JUST TRY
AND STOP ME.

10:06.367 --> 10:10.100
COULD YOU COVER FOR ME
UNTIL I LEAVE TOWN?

10:10.100 --> 10:11.734
SHAWN, THIS IS STUPID.

10:11.734 --> 10:13.600
LOOK, I'VE THOUGHT
ALL THIS THROUGH.

10:13.600 --> 10:16.233
I'VE NEVER BEEN
MORE PSYCHED,
MORE READY

10:16.233 --> 10:18.900
FOR ANYTHING
IN MY WHOLE LIFE.

10:18.900 --> 10:21.200
YOU GOT A FEW BUCKS?

10:21.200 --> 10:22.834
NO!

10:23.934 --> 10:25.500
O.K. JUST ASKING.

10:25.500 --> 10:27.300
WELL...SEE YA.

10:27.300 --> 10:28.300
SHAWN, STOP.

10:28.300 --> 10:29.967
THIS WHOLE THING IS CRAZY.

10:29.967 --> 10:32.767
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE DOING HERE.

10:32.767 --> 10:35.100
CORY, ARE YOU
REALLY MY FRIEND?

10:35.100 --> 10:36.100
YOU KNOW I AM.

10:36.100 --> 10:38.200
THEN YOU'LL
LET ME GO.

10:44.367 --> 10:46.934
"SO, IN CONCLUSION,
I FIND ERIC MATTHEWS

10:46.934 --> 10:49.000
"TO BE REALLY, REALLY,
REALLY SMART,

10:49.000 --> 10:50.200
"REALLY, REALLY,
REALLY NICE,

"AND REALLY, REALLY, REALLY
GOOD FOR YOUR SCHOOL.

11:02.500 --> 11:04.600
PRINCIP, UH, PRINCIP...

11:04.600 --> 11:06.734
UH, HEAD GUY.

11:07.934 --> 11:09.000
OH!

11:09.000 --> 11:11.200
COLLEGE, HERE I COME.

11:12.367 --> 11:14.000
ERIC, YOU'RE UP EARLY.
WHAT'S THAT?

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
IT'S A, UH, PAPER
I'M WORKING ON.

11:16.000 --> 11:17.800
WHY DIDN'T YOU
USE THE COMPUTER?

11:17.800 --> 11:21.900
IT'S ON THE AMISH, AND SOMEHOW
IT JUST SEEMED WRONG.

11:21.900 --> 11:22.934
CAN I READ IT?

11:22.934 --> 11:24.734
OH, YOU KNOW THE AMISH.

11:24.734 --> 11:26.767
THEY'RE VERY
PRIVATE PEOPLE.

11:26.767 --> 11:28.800
SON, YOU'RE SCARING ME.

11:29.900 --> 11:31.133
TYPEWRITER?

11:31.133 --> 11:34.734
OH, ERIC,
DID YOU PUT A WAFFLE
IN THE COMPUTER AGAIN?

11:34.734 --> 11:37.100
MOM, I WAS 15.
LET IT DIE.

11:37.100 --> 11:39.367
I CAN'T BELIEVE
HE DOES THIS TO ME

11:39.367 --> 11:40.834
OVER AND OVER AGAIN.

11:40.834 --> 11:41.867
DOES WHAT?

11:41.867 --> 11:44.467
I SAID I DON'T WANT
TO TALK ABOUT IT!

11:44.467 --> 11:45.467
YOU DID NOT.

11:45.467 --> 11:47.700
WELL, I DON'T WANT
TO TALK ABOUT IT.

11:47.700 --> 11:50.500
I DEFINITELY
SAID IT THAT TIME.

11:51.667 --> 11:54.200
SORRY. IT'S BEEN
A REALLY ROUGH MORNING.

11:54.200 --> 11:57.700
FIRST, I HAD
THIS SCARY DREAM.

11:57.700 --> 11:59.300
THE CLOWNS?

11:59.300 --> 12:02.100
YEAH, YEAH.
THE SAME ONE.

12:02.100 --> 12:04.800
AND THEN--
OH, WHO AM I KIDDING?

12:04.800 --> 12:07.000
I KNOW WHAT
I'VE GOT TO DO.

12:07.000 --> 12:08.100
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

12:08.100 --> 12:11.100
THE RIGHT THING,
AND IT'S ALL YOUR FAULT.

12:11.100 --> 12:14.300
YOU HAD TO GO
AND RAISE ME RIGHT.

12:14.300 --> 12:16.767
OH, GREAT.
TURNER'S MACHINE.

12:16.767 --> 12:21.734
NOW I GOT TO LISTEN
TO THREE MINUTES
OF CAT STEVENS.

12:21.734 --> 12:23.100
OH, DON'T!

12:23.100 --> 12:24.467
WHO AM I KIDDING?

12:24.467 --> 12:26.133
I'LL JUST TELL HIM
IN PERSON.

12:26.133 --> 12:29.767
I'LL TAKE A SHOT IN THE DARK--
SOMETHING'S BUGGING HIM.

12:29.767 --> 12:31.600
THANKS, WAFFLE BOY.

12:31.600 --> 12:35.233
ALAN,
DID YOU SEE THIS LETTER
GEORGE WROTE FOR ERIC?

12:35.233 --> 12:36.500
UH, MOM--

12:36.500 --> 12:39.500
"DEAR SIR,
IF YOU ONLY ACCEPT
ONE STUDENT THIS YEAR,

12:39.500 --> 12:41.600
MAKE IT ERIC MATTHEWS."

12:42.667 --> 12:43.867
"HEY, WOULD I,
GEORGE FEENY,

12:43.867 --> 12:46.200
"BE WRITING THIS LETTER
ON MY PERSONAL
STATIONERY

12:46.200 --> 12:48.800
"IF I REALLY,
REALLY...

12:48.800 --> 12:51.133
REALLY DIDN'T
BELIEVE THAT?"

12:51.133 --> 12:55.500
I CAUGHT HIM
IN A REALLY, REALLY,
REALLY GOOD MOOD.

12:55.500 --> 12:56.600
HA HA HA--

12:56.600 --> 12:58.734
AW!

12:58.734 --> 13:00.500
ELI!

13:01.500 --> 13:03.000
I HAVE TO TELL YOU,

13:03.000 --> 13:05.400
I HAD THE MOST
MARVELOUS TIME
YESTERDAY

13:05.400 --> 13:06.700
RECORDING MY VOICE.

13:06.700 --> 13:10.400
I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE
HOW THEY PUT IT ALL
TOGETHER.

13:10.400 --> 13:12.400
IT'S JUST A STUDENT
PROJECT, GEORGE.

13:12.400 --> 13:14.834
OH, I STILL WANT
TO HAVE A COPY.

13:14.834 --> 13:16.300
HERE'S THE THING.

13:16.300 --> 13:19.233
SEE, THE KIDS...

13:19.233 --> 13:21.734
THEY CUT YOU OUT.

13:22.834 --> 13:24.367
WHAT?
I--I FOUGHT FOR YOU,

13:24.367 --> 13:27.500
BUT THEY DECIDED TO GO
IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION.

13:27.500 --> 13:29.300
WHAT DIRECTION
WOULD THAT BE?

13:29.300 --> 13:30.300
ME--BUT DON'T WORRY!

13:30.300 --> 13:32.200
THERE'LL BE PLENTY
OF OTHER PROJECTS.

13:32.200 --> 13:33.600
SOMETHING WILL COME UP.

13:33.600 --> 13:36.967
KEEP YOUR PITY, MAN!

13:40.700 --> 13:43.600
MR. TURNER,
WE GOT TO TALK.
IT'S ABOUT SHAWN.

13:43.600 --> 13:46.500
WAIT, DON'T TELL ME.
TODAY HE HAS AFRICAN SLOTH.

13:46.500 --> 13:50.000
I'M NOT SUPPOSED
TO TELL YOU,
BUT I GOT TO.

13:50.000 --> 13:51.667
SHAWN TOOK OFF.

13:51.667 --> 13:53.600
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

13:53.600 --> 13:54.934
WHERE DID HE GO?

13:54.934 --> 13:56.133
I DON'T KNOW.

13:56.133 --> 13:58.967
HE MET WITH
THE GUIDANCE COUNSELOR,
THEN HE SPLIT.

13:58.967 --> 14:02.400
MATTHEW, THANKS.
YOU DID THE RIGHT THING.

14:02.400 --> 14:05.367
YEAH. I'M CURSED.

14:07.400 --> 14:09.300
YOU DEVON COLLINS?
UH-HUH.

14:09.300 --> 14:11.033
I SENT SHAWN HUNTER
YESTERDAY.

14:11.033 --> 14:12.367
OH, YOU'RE
JONATHAN TURNER!

14:12.367 --> 14:15.100
HE'S RUN AWAY.
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHERE?

14:15.100 --> 14:16.100
HE RAN AWAY?

14:16.100 --> 14:17.467
WHAT DID YOU TALK ABOUT?

14:17.467 --> 14:18.867
I NEED TO MAKE
SENSE OF THIS.

14:18.867 --> 14:24.100
WE TALKED ABOUT
FAMILY AND COLLEGE
AND FINDING YOURSELF...

14:24.100 --> 14:25.100
UH-OH.

14:25.100 --> 14:26.100
WHAT?

14:26.100 --> 14:28.600
I DID MENTION
MY YEAR OFF IN EUROPE.

14:28.600 --> 14:29.667
YOU SAID THAT?

14:29.667 --> 14:32.500
COME ON! WHAT KIND
OF GUIDANCE IS THAT?

14:32.500 --> 14:34.834
BACK UP. I SPENT
HALF AN HOUR WITH HIM.

14:34.834 --> 14:36.000
HE'S LIVED WITH YOU
FOUR MONTHS.

14:36.000 --> 14:39.000
WHY DO<i>YOU  </i>THINK HE RAN AWAY?

14:39.000 --> 14:41.200
OOH. THAT WAS GOOD.

14:49.500 --> 14:51.233
GRIFF AND HARLEY
FIGHTING?

14:51.233 --> 14:52.500
JUST DON'T SEEM RIGHT.

14:52.500 --> 14:53.900
MAYBE THEY WON'T SHOW.

14:53.900 --> 14:56.400
MAYBE THEY REALIZED
FIGHTING DOESN'T SOLVE
ANYTHING.

14:56.400 --> 14:58.400
MAYBE THEY HAD
ONE OF THOSE MOMENTS

14:58.400 --> 15:00.967
WHERE, SUDDENLY,
EVERYTHING MAKES SENSE.

15:00.967 --> 15:02.734
AN EPIPHANY?

15:02.734 --> 15:04.100
NO.

15:14.600 --> 15:15.767
JOSEPH, IS IT ME,

15:15.767 --> 15:19.767
OR DO I SUDDENLY SENSE
AN EERIE CALM?

15:32.600 --> 15:34.200
A SWINGING LOCKER...

15:34.200 --> 15:35.567
PAPER BLOWING BY,

15:35.567 --> 15:38.100
FRANKIE,
THAT CAN'T BE GOOD.

15:38.100 --> 15:41.000
WE GOT TO GET
OUT OF HERE NOW!

15:41.000 --> 15:42.000
WE CAN'T!

15:42.000 --> 15:44.867
MY MOM DON'T
PICK US UP TILL 3:30.

15:44.867 --> 15:47.100
YOU AND YOUR
STINKING CARPOOL!

15:48.600 --> 15:49.800
HERE I AM.

15:49.800 --> 15:51.500
PUNCTUAL,
AS IS MY WAY.

15:51.500 --> 15:54.834
YET I DO NOT SEE
THE OBJECT OF MY DESPISE.

15:54.834 --> 15:59.000
SO I GUESS
YOU WERE SENT UP
FOR BAD GRAMMAR?

16:00.066 --> 16:02.300
THIS...IS GRIFF?

16:02.300 --> 16:03.934
WHERE'S THE REST OF HIM?

16:03.934 --> 16:06.900
SO, BRANDO, I HEAR
YOU WANT TO POUND ME.

16:06.900 --> 16:10.200
POUND IS
SUCH A WUSSY WORD.

16:10.200 --> 16:13.100
I PREFER...

16:13.100 --> 16:15.567
NO. POUND WORKS.

16:18.800 --> 16:20.734

YOU WAITING FOR?

16:20.734 --> 16:22.767
SEE, THE SOONER
YOU HIT ME,

16:22.767 --> 16:24.467
THE SOONER
FEENY FINDS OUT,

16:24.467 --> 16:27.000
THE SOONER YOU'RE BACK
IN REFORM SCHOOL.

16:27.000 --> 16:29.100
BUT I'M SURE
A SMART GUY LIKE YOU

16:29.100 --> 16:30.400
ALREADY
FIGURED THAT OUT.

16:30.400 --> 16:33.300
HE'S A THINKER,
THIS ONE.

16:34.367 --> 16:35.367
SO THE FIGHT'S OVER!

16:35.367 --> 16:38.300
WHO'S UP FOR
A LITTLE CHINESE?

16:38.300 --> 16:40.400
I'M A THINKER, TOO.

16:40.400 --> 16:41.700
BOYS, DO HIM.

16:41.700 --> 16:46.000
UH, BY--BY DO HIM,
YOU MUST MEAN
FRANKIE THE ENFORCER.

16:46.000 --> 16:48.600
NOT ME. LET'S FACE IT,
I'M THE BRAIN.

16:48.600 --> 16:51.734
I'M WAITING, FRANKIE.

16:52.900 --> 16:53.934
ALL RIGHT.

16:53.934 --> 16:56.600
I KNOW WHAT I GOT TO DO.

16:56.600 --> 16:58.000
I'M SORRY
ABOUT THIS, BUT...

I'M SAYING EXACTLY
WHAT YOU SHOULD SAY.

IT'LL DO A LOT OF GOOD
FOR YOU, JOEY.

17:17.400 --> 17:19.200
COME ON, FROM IN HERE.

17:19.200 --> 17:22.500
I DON'T WANT TO BE

17:22.500 --> 17:25.200
I GOING TO BE
MY OWN MAN.

17:25.200 --> 17:26.367
THERE, I SAID IT.

17:26.367 --> 17:29.600
NOW, THAT'S WHAT
YOU CALL AN EPIPHANY.

17:29.600 --> 17:32.700

17:35.700 --> 17:39.500
I GUESS WE HAVE NOTHING
TO FIGHT ABOUT ANYMORE.

17:39.500 --> 17:40.900
A PLEASURE MEETING YOU.

AND, UH, GOOD LUCK WITH
THIS WHOLE RETRO THING.

17:46.834 --> 17:49.000

17:57.767 --> 17:59.000
YEAH, WELL, YOU KNOW...

17:59.000 --> 18:01.100
IT'S GOING TO BE
A REAL CHALLENGE

18:01.100 --> 18:02.834
BEATING IT OUT OF YOU.

18:02.834 --> 18:03.934
AND THE BEAUTY IS,

18:03.934 --> 18:06.667
I GAVE OLD
CRISCO-HEAD KINER
A FAKE WALLET.

18:06.667 --> 18:10.233
I'D LIKE TO SEE HIS FACE
WHEN HE FINDS OUT.

18:14.934 --> 18:17.133
BUT PERTURBED.

18:23.600 --> 18:26.800
HEY, KID,
WANT A MANGO?

18:28.734 --> 18:29.734
SURE.

18:29.734 --> 18:31.200
THANKS, MISTER.

18:31.200 --> 18:32.200
DON'T THANK ME.

18:32.200 --> 18:36.300
THANK...
"GEORGE FEENY"!

18:37.400 --> 18:40.767
HEY, THERE'S TEETH
IN THIS BASKET!

18:40.767 --> 18:42.600
OH, WAIT.

18:42.600 --> 18:43.600
HEH HEH.

18:43.600 --> 18:45.367
THEY'RE MINE.

18:48.100 --> 18:50.100
OH! HUNTER,
YOU'RE STILL HERE.

18:50.100 --> 18:51.800
JOHN, HOW DID
YOU FIND ME?

18:51.800 --> 18:54.400
EASY. ONCE I FOUND OUT
WHERE YOU WERE GOING,

18:54.400 --> 18:58.000
I FIGURED--SHAWN HUNTER,
EUROPE, BUS.

18:58.000 --> 18:59.033
AND I'M GOING.

18:59.033 --> 19:01.500
HERE'S MY TICKET.
NEXT STOP, PARIS.

19:01.500 --> 19:03.567
PARIS, TEXAS?

19:03.567 --> 19:06.000
OH...I THOUGHT
THE "TX" MEANT TAX.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.600
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT MISS COLLINS
TOLD YOU,

19:08.600 --> 19:10.767
BUT RUNNING AWAY
IS NOT THE ANSWER.

19:10.767 --> 19:13.000
JOHN, I'M NOT RUNNING AWAY.

19:13.000 --> 19:14.400
I'M FINALLY
GOING SOMEPLACE,

19:14.400 --> 19:16.700
DOING SOMETHING
WITH MY LIFE.

19:16.700 --> 19:18.300
I COULD SKI THE ALPS

19:18.300 --> 19:21.900
OR EVEN GO TO SPAIN
AND CHASE THE BULLS.

19:21.900 --> 19:24.700
UH, ACTUALLY,
THEY CHASE YOU.

19:24.700 --> 19:26.300
THEN,
WHO NEEDS SPAIN?

19:26.300 --> 19:27.500
EUROPE'S A BIG TOWN.

19:27.500 --> 19:30.800
I'M SURE THERE'S TONS
OF COOL STUFF I CAN DO.

19:30.800 --> 19:32.200
THIS IS A BIG STEP.

19:32.200 --> 19:35.700
HOW COME YOU DIDN'T
COME AND TALK TO ME
ABOUT IT?

19:35.700 --> 19:38.734
WELL, JOHN, BECAUSE YOU GOT
YOUR OWN STUFF GOING ON.

19:38.734 --> 19:41.700
THAT DOESN'T MEAN
I DON'T CARE WHAT'S
HAPPENING WITH YOU.

19:41.700 --> 19:43.300
I KNOW
YOU CARE ABOUT ME.

19:43.300 --> 19:46.800
I KNOW THAT, INSIDE,
YOU'RE LIKE MY BUDDY
AND ALL.

19:46.800 --> 19:47.934
YOU'RE MY BUDDY, TOO,

19:47.934 --> 19:50.200
BUT MORE THAN THAT,
I'M RESPONSIBLE FOR YOU.

19:50.200 --> 19:53.200
JOHN,
GIVE YOURSELF A BREAK.

19:53.200 --> 19:55.967
IT'S NOT LIKE
YOU'RE MY DAD.

19:55.967 --> 19:58.300
NO, I GUESS I'M NOT.

19:58.300 --> 20:00.200
AND I'M COOL WITH THAT.

20:00.200 --> 20:02.800
I'M USED TO BEING
ON MY OWN.

20:02.800 --> 20:06.000
IT'S MADE ME REALIZE
I GOT TO LOOK OUT
FOR MYSELF.

20:07.500 --> 20:09.400
SO I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

20:09.400 --> 20:11.600
THANKS FOR THE ROOF.

20:11.600 --> 20:13.100
SHAWN!

20:13.100 --> 20:15.133
GET BACK HERE.

20:16.467 --> 20:18.000
YOU'RE NOT
GOING ANYWHERE.

20:18.000 --> 20:19.800
I'M GOING TO EUROPE.

20:19.800 --> 20:21.700
NO. YOU'RE GOING TO TEXAS.

20:21.700 --> 20:23.200
YOU'RE 15,
YOU GOT NO MONEY,

20:23.200 --> 20:26.567
AND YOU HAVE
NO IDEA WHAT YOU'RE
GETTING YOURSELF INTO.

20:26.567 --> 20:29.867
YOU THINK THERE'S A CHANCE
THAT I'M RIGHT?

20:29.867 --> 20:31.000
I DON'T KNOW.

20:31.000 --> 20:34.300
YOU'RE COMING HOME WITH ME,
WHERE YOU BELONG.

20:34.300 --> 20:36.967
IF YOU REALLY WANT
TO GO TO EUROPE,

20:36.967 --> 20:40.367
WE'LL GO TOGETHER,
NEXT SUMMER.

20:40.367 --> 20:42.600
I COULD SEE THAT
WORKING.

20:42.600 --> 20:45.233
BUT ONLY IF YOU
START GOING TO CLASS

20:45.233 --> 20:48.400
AND GETTING
THOSE GRADES UP.

20:48.400 --> 20:49.667
O.K.? NOW COME ON.

20:49.667 --> 20:52.500
GOT A HISTORY TEST
TO MAKE UP.

20:52.500 --> 20:56.734
HEY, KID, YOU LISTEN
TO YOUR DAD.

20:59.200 --> 21:02.100
YEAH. I THINK
I'M GOING TO.

21:06.667 --> 21:10.100
ALL RIGHT!
I'M GOING TO EUROPE!

21:13.900 --> 21:14.934
IF I DON'T TELL,

21:14.934 --> 21:17.734
SHAWN RUNS AWAY,
AND I LOSE MY BEST FRIEND.

21:17.734 --> 21:19.100
IF I DO, SHAWN GETS MAD.

21:19.100 --> 21:21.100
I STILL LOSE
MY BEST FRIEND.

21:21.100 --> 21:22.800
EITHER WAY, I LOSE.
CORY--

21:22.800 --> 21:25.600
PLUS, HARLEY'S BACK,
AND I'M RUNNING OUT
OF WALLETS.

21:25.600 --> 21:26.600
EXCUSE ME.

21:26.600 --> 21:29.400
I ALSO HAVE
THESE CIRCUS DREAMS.

21:29.400 --> 21:31.467
THIS IS REALLY
NOT THE TYPE

21:31.467 --> 21:32.600
OF COUNSELING I DO,

21:32.600 --> 21:35.300
BUT WHEN YOU'RE READY
TO TALK ABOUT COLLEGES,

21:35.300 --> 21:36.300
COME BACK.

21:36.300 --> 21:39.200
LOOK WHAT I FOUND.

21:39.200 --> 21:40.300
SHAWN, YOU'RE BACK.

21:40.300 --> 21:42.767
A LITTLE OLDER,
A LITTLE WISER.

21:42.767 --> 21:44.300
SHAWN, BEFORE
YOU LEAVE AGAIN,

21:44.300 --> 21:48.033
COULD YOU LET ME KNOW
WHAT YOU THINK I SAID?

21:48.033 --> 21:49.033
HUH?

21:49.033 --> 21:50.934
IF STILL YOU HAVE
ANY QUESTIONS,

21:50.934 --> 21:53.300
YOU CAN ALWAYS TALK TO ME.

21:53.300 --> 21:54.667
IS THAT EVERYTHING?

21:54.667 --> 21:57.100
'CAUSE I'D LIKE
A LITTLE CLOSURE

21:57.100 --> 21:59.233
WITH MY FRIEND HERE.

22:01.934 --> 22:02.967
I'M NOT ANGRY AT YOU--

22:02.967 --> 22:04.300
OH, YOU'RE NOT ANGRY?

22:04.300 --> 22:05.600
WELL, I'M NOT
APOLOGIZING.

22:05.600 --> 22:09.233
I DID A LOT OF READING,
AND I CAN NO LONGER

22:09.233 --> 22:10.934
BE RESPONSIBLE
FOR YOUR ACTIONS.

22:10.934 --> 22:14.500
GOT IT. SO I MISSED
THE BIOLOGY TEST
THIS MORNING?

22:14.500 --> 22:17.834
OH, DON'T WORRY.
I TOOK IT FOR YOU.
