WEBVTT

00:03.520 --> 00:05.336
No need to start drawing
battle lines up just yet.

00:05.360 --> 00:06.576
You've forgotten what he's like.

00:06.600 --> 00:07.680
Where is he now?

00:07.840 --> 00:09.960
Gone down to fucking
Furry Bog with Eric.

00:10.120 --> 00:11.400
Any cash lying around?

00:11.600 --> 00:13.496
Yeah, but that's all
earmarked for the Batuks.

00:13.520 --> 00:15.160
Everything has just
changed, Amanda.

00:15.280 --> 00:16.600
I hope you get that.

00:16.800 --> 00:18.880
Amanda looks
after the finances.

00:19.040 --> 00:21.200
We can't have someone
we don't trust holding

00:21.400 --> 00:23.840
the purse strings
for this family.

00:24.000 --> 00:25.840
I'm only around the corner
if you need me.

00:26.040 --> 00:29.480
You need to keep Anna
far away from him.

00:29.640 --> 00:31.120
I know.

00:31.320 --> 00:33.040
Something I need
to talk to you about.

00:33.200 --> 00:34.200
Okay, that's...

00:34.320 --> 00:36.040
Anna, are you
coming back or what?

00:36.240 --> 00:37.240
Aah!

00:37.320 --> 00:38.400
Bren.

00:38.560 --> 00:40.040
Told ya I wouldn't
forget ya, Ged.

00:41.360 --> 00:43.040
Ged Delaney, was that you?

00:43.200 --> 00:44.280
He was a snitch.

00:44.480 --> 00:45.840
He was one of our
best customers.

00:46.000 --> 00:48.120
I was counting on his money
to pay the Batuks.

00:48.320 --> 00:50.000
We need to find
new buyers quickly.

00:50.200 --> 00:52.440
Anthony, this is your granddad.

00:52.640 --> 00:54.200
You just call me
Bren, young fella.

00:54.320 --> 00:55.359
Okay.

00:55.360 --> 00:56.520
You ever shot one before?

00:56.680 --> 00:58.080
No.
Nothing to it.

00:58.280 --> 00:59.600
Alright, now remember
what I said.

00:59.720 --> 01:01.040
Enjoy it.

01:44.280 --> 01:46.720
Close that down, will you?
Wait outside.

01:46.880 --> 01:48.520
Don't let anyone in
we don't know.

03:31.640 --> 03:33.400
You off already?

03:35.640 --> 03:38.960
I told you, Jimmy,
you're welcome to come, too.

03:39.160 --> 03:41.360
Eh, no.
You two go.

03:41.480 --> 03:42.480
Get dressed.

03:42.640 --> 03:44.080
I'll wait.
I don't mind.

03:44.240 --> 03:46.320
It's grand.

03:46.440 --> 03:47.920
It's grand.

03:48.080 --> 03:51.280
I've stuff to do anyway
today, so...

03:51.440 --> 03:52.600
Okay.

03:55.080 --> 03:56.600
I'll see you later.

03:59.320 --> 04:00.440
I'll see you later.

04:01.400 --> 04:02.840
Yeah.

04:25.280 --> 04:26.520
No Rory today?

04:26.720 --> 04:28.320
I didn't think we needed him.

04:30.040 --> 04:31.880
Fair enough.

04:45.560 --> 04:47.320
What do you think, Birdy?

04:50.840 --> 04:52.600
About what?

04:56.000 --> 04:57.720
My cologne.

04:57.880 --> 04:59.000
You like it?

04:59.160 --> 05:01.240
It's nice, yeah.

05:01.400 --> 05:03.280
Come on,
get a proper smell of it.

05:08.400 --> 05:10.040
I do like it.

05:10.240 --> 05:11.440
Yeah.

05:11.560 --> 05:13.400
That's Viking.

05:13.560 --> 05:15.360
I'll see you later, love.

05:32.920 --> 05:35.040
Mam's gone already?
Yeah, she has a meeting.

05:35.200 --> 05:37.160
With Uncle Michael?
Yeah.

05:40.160 --> 05:43.400
I couldn't go.
I've...

05:43.560 --> 05:46.200
got stuff to do
with your Granda.

05:46.320 --> 05:47.840
Right.

05:51.240 --> 05:52.640
You okay?

05:56.520 --> 05:58.160
Granda took me out with Eric...

06:00.240 --> 06:01.960
to teach me how to shoot.

06:08.120 --> 06:09.920
Huh.

06:10.080 --> 06:12.520
You tell your mother about it?

06:12.680 --> 06:14.120
No.

06:19.080 --> 06:20.880
Probably best that you don't.

06:22.640 --> 06:24.800
Okay.

06:24.960 --> 06:26.640
Go on. Fuck off.

06:31.880 --> 06:33.280
See you later.

06:42.640 --> 06:43.880
Love you, buddy.

06:44.040 --> 06:45.560
Love you, too.

06:48.800 --> 06:51.920
So, what do we know
about Wayne Madigan?

06:52.120 --> 06:53.896
Frank says he's been
keeping a low profile

06:53.920 --> 06:56.520
while he's growing his business.

06:56.680 --> 06:58.160
Right.

07:04.480 --> 07:07.280
You sure this is the place?

07:07.400 --> 07:08.960
It's where he said.

07:21.240 --> 07:22.800
Wait here.

07:29.000 --> 07:31.680
Not what I expected.

07:31.800 --> 07:34.040
No.

07:34.200 --> 07:35.920
It's a clever front.

08:14.280 --> 08:17.120
Alright, Jimmy?

08:24.280 --> 08:25.600
Hey, Jimmy.

08:38.480 --> 08:40.400
What's up?

08:45.920 --> 08:49.480
Why do we still have Kem
hanging around here?

08:49.600 --> 08:50.640
Cos he's sound.

08:52.400 --> 08:55.840
Uh!
He got us this.

08:56.000 --> 08:57.240
He can get you one, too, Jimmy.

08:57.280 --> 08:59.920
I'm grand.

09:00.080 --> 09:01.600
Why don't you like him?

09:01.760 --> 09:02.839
Pfft...

09:02.840 --> 09:04.200
Cos he's a fucking racist.

09:04.360 --> 09:06.840
Fuck off, Eric.

09:06.960 --> 09:08.600
What's the problem, then?

09:08.760 --> 09:10.040
There's no problem.

09:10.240 --> 09:12.056
I just think that we should
be keeping as much stuff

09:12.080 --> 09:14.360
as possible
within the family, that's all.

09:15.920 --> 09:17.320
Safer that way, innit?

09:25.120 --> 09:27.280
Did you call Frank
like I asked you?

09:27.440 --> 09:28.440
Yeah.

09:28.520 --> 09:29.920
Yeah, it all got through.

09:31.560 --> 09:33.680
This is gonna be some payday.

09:59.000 --> 10:01.120
You were supposed to be here
20 minutes ago.

10:01.240 --> 10:02.840
Oh, sorry about that.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.240
Traffic was a nightmare.

10:05.440 --> 10:07.840
Frank said you might be
interested in a purchase?

10:08.000 --> 10:10.480
All depends on the price.

10:10.600 --> 10:12.520
It's 40 a kilo of H.

10:19.120 --> 10:21.720
I was thinking closer
to 20, 25 a kilo.

10:23.160 --> 10:25.760
At that price,
we'd be working for you.

10:25.920 --> 10:27.960
I already have a supplier,

10:28.160 --> 10:31.320
who's gonna be pissed off
if I start buying from you.

10:31.480 --> 10:33.840
So what's in it for me?

10:34.000 --> 10:37.360
35 a kilo,
if the order's big enough.

10:37.520 --> 10:39.120
Still not low enough.

10:39.280 --> 10:42.360
We can guarantee supply --
as much as you want of anything.

10:45.040 --> 10:47.440
Is that what you told
Ged Delaney?

10:47.680 --> 10:51.440
Had nothing to do with us --
it was a personal dispute.

10:55.480 --> 10:56.920
Do you want the business or not?

11:02.360 --> 11:04.000
Not at those prices.

11:04.160 --> 11:06.520
33 a kilo.

11:06.720 --> 11:09.720
That's the absolute lowest
we can go.

11:09.880 --> 11:12.920
Look -- I'll be honest.

11:13.120 --> 11:15.320
Everyone knows you lot have got
a huge debt to pay off,

11:15.520 --> 11:17.000
and you're left holding
a load of gear

11:17.080 --> 11:18.800
that Ged was meant to buy.

11:18.960 --> 11:23.120
So I figured if I can get
something for a steal...

11:23.280 --> 11:25.920
why not?

11:26.080 --> 11:29.560
But anything over 25
is not worth the grief.

11:47.920 --> 11:50.280
Fuck.

11:52.160 --> 11:54.640
Maybe we should think
about reopening our houses,

11:54.800 --> 11:57.800
sell the gear ourselves --
more money in it, too.

11:57.960 --> 11:59.240
We're in wholesale now.

11:59.440 --> 12:01.440
Not without buyers, we're not.

12:01.640 --> 12:03.440
Yeah, opening the houses
would mean

12:03.640 --> 12:04.920
more cash flow
in a month's time,

12:05.000 --> 12:07.320
but it doesn't solve
the current problem.

12:07.560 --> 12:09.160
The balance of that
first payment is due.

12:09.240 --> 12:10.560
We just need money now.

12:10.680 --> 12:12.320
How much are we short?

12:12.480 --> 12:13.920
Nearly 7 million.

12:19.160 --> 12:20.840
They look great.

12:21.000 --> 12:22.520
Yeah, they're nice.

12:25.040 --> 12:27.800
How's Eric doing
since he came home?

12:27.960 --> 12:30.160
Don't ask me.
I barely see him.

12:30.320 --> 12:31.960
He's always off with Bren.

12:41.960 --> 12:44.000
Eric's a good boy.

12:44.160 --> 12:45.976
That's the first time
he's ever been called that.

12:47.200 --> 12:48.680
He's impetuous.

12:48.800 --> 12:52.680
That's one word for it.

12:52.840 --> 12:55.920
You need to make sure
he doesn't do something stupid.

12:56.040 --> 12:58.160
Something he would regret.

12:59.560 --> 13:01.960
He's not gonna listen to me.

13:02.120 --> 13:03.920
You have to make him
listen to you.

13:04.080 --> 13:06.280
How, exactly?

13:06.480 --> 13:08.016
Well, not by burying your head
in the sand

13:08.040 --> 13:11.440
and just hoping everything's
going to be okay, Nikita.

13:16.080 --> 13:18.720
Show an interest in his work.

13:18.920 --> 13:22.360
Let him know that he --
he can talk to you about it.

13:22.480 --> 13:24.440
Give him your opinions.

13:27.000 --> 13:30.200
He'll start to listen --
you'll see.

13:32.760 --> 13:35.040
Okay.

13:35.200 --> 13:36.640
Good girl.

13:39.120 --> 13:40.920
Gonna get you them boots.

13:44.440 --> 13:45.880
I'd like to get those...

13:46.080 --> 13:48.960
and I think I'll get
those glasses, as well.

13:55.640 --> 13:57.080
Hey, Anto!

14:08.040 --> 14:09.720
How are you?

14:09.840 --> 14:11.440
We've got a job for you.

14:11.600 --> 14:13.840
Yeah?
Yeah.

14:14.040 --> 14:16.920
See that girl you were
talking to there?

14:17.120 --> 14:18.920
Who is she?
That's Anna.

14:19.120 --> 14:20.920
Anna?
Michael's young one?

14:21.080 --> 14:22.560
Yeah.

14:22.720 --> 14:24.600
Right.

14:24.840 --> 14:27.880
You put that in your pocket
and go wait in the car, okay?

14:28.000 --> 14:29.440
Good boy.

14:36.480 --> 14:37.520
Where's he going now?

14:37.680 --> 14:39.240
To talk to Anna, I think.

14:43.240 --> 14:45.800
Anna!
Come here, girl.

14:49.280 --> 14:51.320
Do you know who I am?

14:51.480 --> 14:52.560
I think so.

14:52.680 --> 14:54.200
I'm your grandad.

14:57.400 --> 15:00.360
This is for you...

15:00.520 --> 15:03.440
for all the birthdays I missed.

15:03.640 --> 15:04.840
You don't have to do that.

15:04.960 --> 15:06.840
No, but I want to.

15:07.040 --> 15:10.040
You're part of this family.

15:10.200 --> 15:11.720
Go on, take it.

15:11.920 --> 15:15.720
Buy yourself something nice
from me, okay?

15:15.880 --> 15:17.120
Thanks.

15:17.320 --> 15:19.560
I'll see you again, love,
alright?

15:19.720 --> 15:21.240
Okay.

15:31.280 --> 15:33.600
Well, there must be something
else we can try instead.

15:36.160 --> 15:38.400
There isn't.

15:38.560 --> 15:40.520
What about cash reserves?

15:40.680 --> 15:43.120
Anything liquid
is going to the Batuks,

15:43.320 --> 15:45.560
and the rest is all tied up,
we can't access it.

15:45.760 --> 15:47.400
Well, you should've kept
more in cash.

15:49.160 --> 15:50.200
I would have,

15:50.400 --> 15:51.800
if I'd known
your brother and son

15:52.000 --> 15:54.840
were gonna kill
our best customer.

15:55.000 --> 15:57.520
No one's pretending
this is ideal, Frank.

15:57.680 --> 16:01.440
At least this way, we can
make the first payment.

16:01.600 --> 16:03.320
The others are never gonna
go for it.

16:03.480 --> 16:05.720
But you'll back us up?

16:05.880 --> 16:07.000
Okay.

16:08.880 --> 16:11.920
But it's Bren who's gonna be
your problem.

16:23.840 --> 16:26.440
- Jump out here, Anto.
- Yeah, yeah.

16:32.120 --> 16:33.320
Okay, you wait here.

16:33.520 --> 16:35.320
If you see anyone coming along
this way,

16:35.480 --> 16:37.000
call your father
straightaway, alright?

16:37.040 --> 16:37.920
Yeah, no bother.
Good lad.

16:38.040 --> 16:39.320
See you later.

17:13.560 --> 17:15.800
Lee.
Dotser's nephew.

17:15.920 --> 17:17.040
Where's the gear?

17:17.200 --> 17:18.280
It's all inside.

17:18.480 --> 17:19.880
Right.
Show Eric where it is.

17:20.080 --> 17:23.160
I'll follow you in, I just want
a quick word with Jimmy.

17:32.240 --> 17:35.280
What's up?
What's the problem with Kem?

17:35.440 --> 17:37.480
There's no problem.

17:37.680 --> 17:40.320
I told you -- it's just
he isn't family, that's all.

17:40.520 --> 17:42.360
I don't hear you questioning
any of the others

17:42.560 --> 17:44.176
who aren't family.
Forget I said anything.

17:44.200 --> 17:45.720
I can't, though.

17:45.920 --> 17:48.080
If there's something I need
to know, I want to know it.

17:48.160 --> 17:49.480
There isn't.

17:49.640 --> 17:50.800
You sure about that?

17:50.920 --> 17:52.640
Yeah.

17:52.800 --> 17:54.240
I hope so.

18:03.720 --> 18:05.120
How much is all that?

18:05.280 --> 18:07.160
20 million.

18:07.360 --> 18:10.560
We are moving this right away.

18:10.760 --> 18:13.000
Show everyone
we're the top dogs.

18:13.160 --> 18:15.960
I want you to run these
into town for me

18:16.160 --> 18:17.240
and leave them in the desk

18:17.440 --> 18:21.520
in the back office
of the pub, okay?

18:21.680 --> 18:22.920
Yeah, no bother.

18:26.080 --> 18:27.520
It's just Amanda.

18:27.680 --> 18:29.160
Yeah?

18:31.560 --> 18:33.200
Yeah, okay.

18:33.400 --> 18:34.800
Yeah, I'll let them know.

18:35.000 --> 18:37.360
Hey, something's come up.

18:37.560 --> 18:39.960
Amanda and Michael need
to see us all -- now.

18:40.960 --> 18:42.240
In the desk.

19:36.120 --> 19:37.160
It's all set.

19:37.320 --> 19:38.360
Where?

19:38.520 --> 19:39.920
At the Furry Bog.

19:40.120 --> 19:41.520
Bren and Eric
are there every night.

19:41.600 --> 19:43.040
Right.

19:43.200 --> 19:45.296
I've this young fella lined up.
He'll do it for two grand.

19:45.320 --> 19:46.600
No.

19:46.760 --> 19:48.400
I'm doing this one meself.

19:48.600 --> 19:51.400
You don't need
the fucking hassle, Kev.

19:51.560 --> 19:53.400
Let the kid do it.

19:53.600 --> 19:55.600
Have you forgotten
what they did to Ged?

19:55.720 --> 19:57.000
Of course not.

19:57.160 --> 20:00.120
Wasting them cunts
is no fucking hassle.

20:00.280 --> 20:02.800
So put a spotter on the pub
and let me know

20:03.000 --> 20:04.840
as soon as they're there, yeah?

20:05.000 --> 20:06.440
Go on.

21:19.298 --> 21:20.338
Where were you?

21:20.538 --> 21:22.938
Out with Da, Eric, and Granda.

21:23.058 --> 21:24.378
Go up to your room.

21:24.538 --> 21:26.778
He's old enough
to be part of this.

21:28.738 --> 21:30.218
Now, Anthony.

21:30.338 --> 21:32.498
I know what goes on anyway.

21:32.658 --> 21:34.178
Jimmy, tell him.

21:36.338 --> 21:38.058
He's almost 17.

21:42.738 --> 21:45.858
Don't make me drag you
up those stairs.

21:48.258 --> 21:49.818
Go on.

21:54.298 --> 21:56.538
What's this all about, anyway?

21:56.738 --> 21:59.658
The Batuks, and how we make
the first payment.

21:59.858 --> 22:01.818
Right, well, you know
my feeling on that.

22:01.938 --> 22:03.418
Fuck them!

22:03.618 --> 22:06.738
Yeah, makes sense, considering
the last time this family

22:06.898 --> 22:09.458
was in a hole, you weren't
exactly rushing to help us.

22:11.698 --> 22:13.818
With Ged Delaney gone,
we've lost our biggest customer

22:13.938 --> 22:16.938
and we're left holding
his order in our hands.

22:17.138 --> 22:19.618
There's always other buyers.

22:19.818 --> 22:22.178
We found one who's willing
to take the heroin off us

22:22.298 --> 22:23.778
at 25,000 a kilo.

22:23.938 --> 22:25.298
The fucks.

22:25.458 --> 22:27.258
At that price,
we're losing money on the gear.

22:27.298 --> 22:29.314
We'd take a hit, but we'd have
the cash for the first payment.

22:29.338 --> 22:31.314
We'll make back the losses
over the next few shipments.

22:31.338 --> 22:33.378
No, fuck that.
I want me slice now.

22:33.538 --> 22:34.738
We all want that, Eric,

22:34.938 --> 22:37.458
but it's probably not
that fucking simple, is it?

22:37.618 --> 22:40.018
Well, it would be if we hadn't
agreed to give away

22:40.178 --> 22:42.178
90 fucking million.

22:42.298 --> 22:43.898
And for what?

22:44.098 --> 22:45.698
Are we supposed to believe
that the Turks

22:45.898 --> 22:48.818
are just gonna fucking
ride off into the sunset?

22:48.978 --> 22:50.618
Well, it's what
they've agreed to.

22:50.778 --> 22:53.258
Well, they're lying.

22:53.418 --> 22:55.698
She got lucky
with Eamon Cunningham,

22:55.898 --> 22:58.498
and now we're treating her
like the fucking messiah.

22:58.658 --> 23:00.298
So what would you do?

23:00.498 --> 23:02.578
Right, well, instead of giving
all our money away,

23:02.778 --> 23:04.978
I would use it to
take them greasy cunts on.

23:05.138 --> 23:07.338
If you think that
even with 90 million

23:07.538 --> 23:10.538
we can beat the Batuks,
you're fucking deluded.

23:10.698 --> 23:12.538
They're gonna shut down
our supply lines,

23:12.738 --> 23:15.058
stop us doing any business,
and pay people to kill us off.

23:15.298 --> 23:17.458
Yeah, let them fucking try.

23:17.658 --> 23:20.098
We made a deal.
If we break our word now --

23:20.298 --> 23:23.178
No, no, no, no,
you made a fucking deal,

23:23.298 --> 23:25.978
and a shit one at that.

23:26.138 --> 23:28.338
All's they're gonna do
is bleed us dry,

23:28.538 --> 23:29.858
and then when
we've no money left,

23:30.018 --> 23:31.218
they'll fucking come after us.

23:31.298 --> 23:33.258
This is what we agreed to do.

23:33.418 --> 23:36.778
I didn't, and I will not agree
to sell our gear

23:36.898 --> 23:39.378
at a fucking loss.

23:39.578 --> 23:41.698
Are you on board with all this,
Frank?

23:43.458 --> 23:44.738
Yeah.

23:44.898 --> 23:46.058
Right, so that's it, then?

23:46.298 --> 23:48.578
So, you're just like
a fucking sock puppet

23:48.778 --> 23:50.058
for that pair, then, are you?

23:50.258 --> 23:52.978
- Bren...
- No, this fucking needs saying.

23:53.178 --> 23:56.178
No wonder he nearly ran
this family into the ground --

23:56.298 --> 23:57.778
piss weak cunt.

23:57.978 --> 23:59.178
That's enough.

23:59.298 --> 24:00.738
Jesus Christ.

24:00.938 --> 24:04.018
You, her, and that fucking
handbag over there

24:04.218 --> 24:06.778
can cook up any shite you want,

24:06.938 --> 24:09.738
but you're not taking
a single fucking penny

24:09.938 --> 24:15.178
of my cut of that shipment
and giving it to them Turks.

24:15.298 --> 24:17.738
Or Birdy's.

24:17.858 --> 24:20.178
What about you, Eric?

24:20.338 --> 24:22.178
Yeah, I want me full whack.

24:22.378 --> 24:24.058
Jimmy?
He's with us.

24:25.938 --> 24:28.178
She speaks for you now,
does she?

24:28.338 --> 24:29.538
No.
Right.

24:29.698 --> 24:32.058
Well, you might want
to fucking tell her that.

24:32.258 --> 24:35.978
We're trying to spare
this family another war.

24:36.098 --> 24:37.778
Me, Birdy, Eric --

24:37.938 --> 24:40.458
we all say no, so that's
a fucking end to it.

24:42.218 --> 24:43.778
Okay. Yeah.

24:45.458 --> 24:47.738
Okay.

24:47.938 --> 24:50.338
I'll make sure
you three get paid,

24:50.498 --> 24:51.818
even if the rest of us
take a hit.

24:51.858 --> 24:53.458
Are you fucking deaf?

24:53.618 --> 24:55.578
Stop talking to her
like this, Dad.

24:55.738 --> 24:57.258
Stop.

25:00.098 --> 25:02.578
Selling product at a loss

25:02.738 --> 25:06.178
makes this family look
like a fucking joke,

25:06.338 --> 25:08.098
and I'm not fucking having it.

25:14.098 --> 25:17.178
You need to start acting
like the man in this house.

25:35.738 --> 25:37.098
Thanks.

25:37.298 --> 25:39.978
Don't ever do that again.
Don't ever speak for me again.

25:40.138 --> 25:41.298
Jimmy...

25:41.458 --> 25:43.578
Stay out of my fucking
business, Michael.

25:48.698 --> 25:54.538
Well, I told you
they weren't gonna buy it.

26:18.698 --> 26:22.538
I don't want Anthony hanging out
with Bren and Viking, alright?

26:22.698 --> 26:24.738
No.

26:24.938 --> 26:28.338
You don't make all
the decisions, Amanda.

26:28.498 --> 26:29.738
It's not just you and Michael

26:29.938 --> 26:32.458
making all the decisions
on your own.

26:32.658 --> 26:35.498
I have a say in things, too --

26:35.658 --> 26:37.298
about our son,

26:37.498 --> 26:39.898
about what we do with our money,

26:40.098 --> 26:41.658
whether we have
this baby or not.

26:41.778 --> 26:43.458
What?

26:43.658 --> 26:46.058
S-So you're saying
you don't want a baby now?

26:46.258 --> 26:47.778
You know that's not
the fucking point.

26:47.978 --> 26:49.354
Right, well, then,
what is your point?

26:49.378 --> 26:51.338
That you decide everything.

26:51.498 --> 26:52.578
Fucking everything.

26:52.738 --> 26:54.138
And nobody ever asks me
what I want.

26:54.218 --> 26:55.818
Maybe I do want the baby,
maybe I don't.

26:56.018 --> 26:58.258
Who the fuck knows,
cos nobody ever asks.

27:00.498 --> 27:02.858
What's so funny about that?
No, nothing.

27:03.058 --> 27:04.474
I just think that what
you really meant to say

27:04.498 --> 27:05.778
was actually,
you want your daddy

27:05.938 --> 27:07.938
to make decisions for you now
instead of your wife.

27:08.058 --> 27:09.538
Fuck you.
No.

27:09.698 --> 27:11.538
Fuck you, Jimmy.

27:11.698 --> 27:13.418
I've reared our children.

27:13.578 --> 27:15.578
I took care of the money.
I ran the house.

27:15.738 --> 27:17.538
I ran the dealership,
took care of everything.

27:17.658 --> 27:19.538
I practically fucking dress you.

27:19.778 --> 27:22.258
And now, because your father
is back out,

27:22.458 --> 27:24.498
you want to suddenly start
acting a big man

27:24.658 --> 27:26.378
instead of supporting your wife?

27:28.898 --> 27:31.338
Like, fuck you, Jimmy.

27:35.778 --> 27:38.778
I notice you left Michael off
that list of achievements.

27:38.978 --> 27:40.978
No mention of him, no mention
of fucking my brother

27:41.018 --> 27:42.458
behind my back.

27:47.298 --> 27:49.738
Yeah.

27:49.938 --> 27:52.298
That's exactly what I did.

28:58.258 --> 28:59.898
Is he here?

29:00.098 --> 29:02.538
Yeah.
He's inside with Eric.

29:09.058 --> 29:10.418
Stay away from Anna.

29:10.578 --> 29:11.778
She's my granddaughter.

29:11.938 --> 29:14.338
I can fucking --
I said stay the fuck away!

29:14.538 --> 29:16.058
Jesus fucking Christ, Michael!

29:16.258 --> 29:18.858
Keep out of it, Eric.

29:19.058 --> 29:21.858
I'm not gonna ask you again.

29:22.058 --> 29:23.258
Why?

29:23.418 --> 29:26.178
Are you gonna kill me, Michael?

29:26.298 --> 29:28.738
You think I won't?

29:28.898 --> 29:30.938
You think I won't pull
this trigger?

29:31.138 --> 29:33.178
You really think
I won't pull this trigger?

29:33.338 --> 29:34.618
You know what, do it.

29:34.818 --> 29:36.538
Say I won't fucking do it,
see what happens.

29:36.618 --> 29:38.658
Michael, please.
Go on, say it.

29:38.858 --> 29:40.058
Say I won't fucking kill you.

29:40.218 --> 29:41.298
Not here on Birdy's good --

29:49.258 --> 29:51.178
Now, listen here --

29:51.298 --> 29:52.778
go near her again,

29:52.938 --> 29:54.458
next time, it won't be empty.

30:03.658 --> 30:04.978
Fucking prick.

30:21.298 --> 30:22.658
See you in the morning, buddy.

30:22.858 --> 30:23.954
Where are you going?

30:23.978 --> 30:26.458
Just out with Da and Eric.

30:26.658 --> 30:28.818
Okay.
See you, Da.

30:36.698 --> 30:42.538
So... what were you doing with
your father and Bren earlier?

30:42.658 --> 30:44.098
Nothing.

30:45.578 --> 30:48.218
Well, you can't have been
doing nothing.

30:48.378 --> 30:50.778
I mean, nothing interesting.

30:50.978 --> 30:54.778
You'd be surprised
what I'm interested in.

30:54.938 --> 30:56.418
Okay.

30:56.618 --> 30:59.778
We went to the beach,
and Grandad bought me ice cream,

30:59.898 --> 31:01.498
and we built sand castles.

31:01.658 --> 31:03.658
It was the best day ever.

31:03.818 --> 31:05.338
Happy?

31:07.698 --> 31:08.778
Can I go now?

31:08.938 --> 31:10.378
Alright. Go.

31:48.618 --> 31:51.218
Ma!
I'm getting changed in here.

31:51.378 --> 31:52.978
Where you going?

31:53.138 --> 31:54.898
Just down to the pub with Eddie.

31:55.058 --> 31:56.538
Stay here with your family.

32:01.098 --> 32:02.578
Think about what you're doing.

32:02.778 --> 32:03.898
Ma, come on.
Let go.

32:04.058 --> 32:06.178
Ged wouldn't want you
getting locked up for him.

32:08.258 --> 32:09.898
I have to do this.

33:06.362 --> 33:07.602
Alright?
Drink?

33:07.762 --> 33:09.122
Go on, then.

33:09.322 --> 33:12.722
John, another round there.

33:12.882 --> 33:14.722
Get that into you.

33:14.922 --> 33:16.842
Slainte.
Slainte.

33:17.002 --> 33:18.802
Jimmy, your da's
looking for you.

33:33.682 --> 33:34.682
Yeah?

33:36.362 --> 33:37.362
You wanted to see me?

33:37.522 --> 33:39.042
Shut the door.

33:41.042 --> 33:42.442
Look, I've spoken to Amanda,

33:42.642 --> 33:44.842
and I told her that
she doesn't speak for me, so...

33:45.042 --> 33:47.402
All she's doing is making
a fucking mug out of you, Jimmy.

33:47.642 --> 33:49.202
I know.
She knows the score now.

33:49.362 --> 33:51.962
Right, sit down.

33:52.122 --> 33:53.642
Here, try this for size.

33:55.322 --> 33:57.098
There's something else
I need to tell you, Da.

33:57.122 --> 33:59.202
Take a fucking bump.
Go on.

34:01.922 --> 34:03.722
Hey, that's fucking quality.

34:03.882 --> 34:04.921
Yeah.

34:04.922 --> 34:05.922
Listen, Da...

34:07.162 --> 34:08.322
Fuck.
Da.

34:08.482 --> 34:10.282
We're gonna get you
your hole tonight.

34:10.522 --> 34:12.002
Break that fucking
witch's spell --

34:12.162 --> 34:14.602
Kem's a rat.

34:14.802 --> 34:17.442
That's why I don't trust him.

34:17.602 --> 34:20.202
What do you mean
he's a fucking rat?

34:20.362 --> 34:23.122
He was feeding information
to Eamon Cunningham,

34:23.242 --> 34:26.002
and he set up Fudge.

34:26.202 --> 34:29.002
But I thought he helped you
get Con Doyle.

34:29.202 --> 34:30.802
Only because Amanda sussed
what he was at

34:30.922 --> 34:32.362
and forced him into it.

34:32.522 --> 34:34.202
Oh, fucking hell.

34:37.162 --> 34:38.882
But he's been
setting stuff up for us.

34:39.042 --> 34:40.722
I know.

34:40.882 --> 34:43.162
So, why would Eric keep
a fucking rat around?

34:43.282 --> 34:44.322
Eric doesn't know.

34:44.442 --> 34:45.522
Who does?

34:45.642 --> 34:47.522
Me, Michael, and Amanda.

34:47.682 --> 34:49.082
What about Frank and Birdy?

34:51.402 --> 34:53.402
Why not?

34:53.602 --> 34:55.522
That's just the way
Amanda wanted it.

35:17.842 --> 35:18.882
Hello?

35:19.082 --> 35:21.042
I'll be coming to Dublin
in person

35:21.242 --> 35:23.642
to collect your first payment.

35:23.802 --> 35:25.042
That's not necessary.

35:25.202 --> 35:27.042
It is what I'm doing.

35:27.242 --> 35:29.842
We've sent over
half the payment already.

35:30.042 --> 35:31.522
The rest will be there.

35:31.722 --> 35:33.962
Then you have nothing
to worry about.

35:34.122 --> 35:39.002
You owe us a lot of money,
and we intend to get paid.

35:39.162 --> 35:41.082
And I don't want you thinking
we have disappeared

35:41.242 --> 35:42.922
from your life.

35:43.042 --> 35:44.802
If that's what you want.

35:44.962 --> 35:46.002
It is.

35:46.162 --> 35:50.282
I expect everything to go
as we agreed.

35:50.442 --> 35:52.882
No delays or excuses.

35:53.042 --> 35:54.402
I understand.

36:49.442 --> 36:53.402
Just get whoever you can.
In and out quickly.

36:53.642 --> 36:55.002
Yeah, yeah, I know, I know.

37:16.522 --> 37:17.601
Fuck's sake.

37:22.242 --> 37:25.082
Hmm?

37:25.202 --> 37:26.442
What the fuck?

37:26.602 --> 37:27.962
He's got a balaclava.

37:28.162 --> 37:30.122
He's got a balaclava.
He's got a fucking bally!

37:30.282 --> 37:32.522
Put the fucking locks on, John.

37:32.682 --> 37:34.002
Fuck.

37:34.162 --> 37:35.402
Fuck's going on?

37:35.642 --> 37:38.642
Some cunt in a balaclava's
stuck in the porch.

37:45.122 --> 37:47.762
He's trapped.

37:47.962 --> 37:49.762
We have him fucking trapped.

37:49.882 --> 37:51.922
Eric, don't be an idiot.

37:52.082 --> 37:53.522
Look at him.

37:53.722 --> 37:55.202
He's like a monkey
in a fucking cage.

37:55.402 --> 37:56.842
Will you just fucking give over?

37:58.242 --> 37:59.482
Hey, Bren.

37:59.642 --> 38:00.922
Do you see our pet monkey, Bren?

38:01.042 --> 38:02.498
I'm warning you, Eric!

38:02.522 --> 38:04.162
Oi? Oi?

38:07.002 --> 38:10.122
Will you stop it?
Eric!

38:14.842 --> 38:16.562
Fuck's sake.

38:20.962 --> 38:23.362
Hey! Fucking look at me
when I'm talking to you.

38:23.562 --> 38:25.242
You want me to call the Guards?
Not yet.

38:27.482 --> 38:29.122
Kev, what the fuck
are you doing?

38:29.282 --> 38:30.922
Will you stop it?

38:31.082 --> 38:33.642
Eddie, I'm stuck!
I can't get fucking out!

38:33.802 --> 38:36.362
Here!
You fuckin' fool, ya.

38:36.482 --> 38:38.882
What are you gonna do?

38:39.082 --> 38:40.122
You gonna shoot me?
Huh?

38:40.282 --> 38:41.282
Stop it, Eric!

38:41.442 --> 38:42.682
Do it.
I fucking will, ya prick.

38:42.762 --> 38:43.842
Eric!

38:44.002 --> 38:45.081
Fucking do it.

38:45.082 --> 38:46.082
Yeah? Fuck you!
Eric!

38:46.242 --> 38:47.562
Do it!

38:47.682 --> 38:49.962
Fuck! Fuck.

39:01.122 --> 39:03.522
Is he dead?

39:03.642 --> 39:05.122
I hope so.

39:05.322 --> 39:07.562
He's only half
a fucking face left.

39:07.682 --> 39:08.682
Lee!

39:10.522 --> 39:12.522
Go out to the office.

39:12.682 --> 39:15.682
Get all the coke and take it out
the back way, right?

39:15.882 --> 39:17.762
Right, everybody,
stay where you are.

39:17.922 --> 39:19.762
This clown come in here
and shot himself.

39:19.922 --> 39:22.162
We've done nothing wrong.

39:22.362 --> 39:26.162
John, go call the Guards.
Report this shooting.

39:38.402 --> 39:41.682
Alright,
I'm fucking coming.

39:41.842 --> 39:43.522
Fuck's sake.

39:51.322 --> 39:53.642
I've been ringing you for ages.
Why weren't you picking up?

39:53.722 --> 39:56.282
I must have left my phone
in the bedroom or something.

39:56.442 --> 39:58.522
This better be
fucking important.

39:58.722 --> 40:00.322
There was a shooting
down at the pub.

40:00.522 --> 40:02.042
Eric?
No.

40:02.202 --> 40:03.842
No, he's grand.

40:03.962 --> 40:06.122
They all are.

40:06.282 --> 40:09.522
Ged Delaney's little brother
Kevin arrived with a gun,

40:09.682 --> 40:11.322
ended up shooting himself
in the face.

40:11.442 --> 40:12.842
Fuck.

40:13.002 --> 40:15.522
Thought maybe you might want
to head down there,

40:15.682 --> 40:17.522
you know, show your face.

40:30.242 --> 40:31.762
You alright?

40:31.922 --> 40:33.482
It's just an ulcer.

40:35.442 --> 40:38.682
Yeah, my ma's cousin
thought he had an ulcer.

40:38.882 --> 40:40.522
Turned out it was cancer.

40:40.682 --> 40:42.002
Dead in six weeks.

40:42.162 --> 40:43.682
Thanks for the pep talk.

40:46.362 --> 40:47.722
No wonder you have
a fucking ulcer.

40:47.842 --> 40:50.562
Look at all the crap
you're eating.

40:50.762 --> 40:53.562
Living in shit just makes
you feel like shit.

40:53.722 --> 40:55.162
It messes with your head, man.

40:59.082 --> 41:00.738
You need to get a cleaner
in here or something,

41:00.762 --> 41:03.162
and they cost fuck all.

41:03.282 --> 41:04.762
And a cook.

41:11.522 --> 41:12.922
You know what's a real shame?

41:13.082 --> 41:15.162
What?

41:15.362 --> 41:17.042
That they didn't get
Bren tonight.

41:19.962 --> 41:21.642
That's not fucking funny, Frank.

41:21.842 --> 41:25.442
I'd have paid Kev Delaney meself
to clip that fucking cunt.

41:29.602 --> 41:32.442
Seriously, Frank...

41:32.642 --> 41:34.562
don't ever say that
out loud again.

42:12.522 --> 42:16.162
Nuray Batuk called earlier.

42:16.322 --> 42:19.002
She's coming to oversee
the payment herself.

42:19.122 --> 42:20.642
Why?

42:20.842 --> 42:24.002
To try to keep
the pressure on us.

42:24.202 --> 42:26.882
I'm gonna call Wayne Madigan
and just tell him

42:27.082 --> 42:29.522
that we're gonna sell to him
at 25K a kilo.

42:32.122 --> 42:34.122
Bren's gonna be on the warpath.

42:36.722 --> 42:38.282
We have no choice.

42:45.442 --> 42:47.122
I'm so glad you're back.

43:26.082 --> 43:27.682
I was only messing around.

43:27.842 --> 43:29.322
I told you to stop.

43:29.522 --> 43:33.122
It was a fucking joke.

43:33.322 --> 43:34.898
How was I supposed to know
what would happen?

43:34.922 --> 43:36.402
"How was I supposed
to know?"

43:36.602 --> 43:38.562
You should get that
fucking tattooed.

43:42.082 --> 43:43.882
You given your statements yet?

43:44.082 --> 43:45.522
They've taken
the security footage,

43:45.682 --> 43:48.322
so they'll know what happened.

43:48.522 --> 43:51.042
Bren wants a word out back.
Let's go.

43:53.322 --> 43:54.842
I won't be long.

44:18.282 --> 44:20.122
This is ominous.

44:23.122 --> 44:25.002
Kem's a rat.

44:25.162 --> 44:27.562
What?

44:38.562 --> 44:40.162
No.

44:41.882 --> 44:43.522
No, I don't believe that.

44:43.722 --> 44:47.842
He was feeding Eamon Cunningham
info the whole time.

44:47.962 --> 44:49.242
That's bollocks, Bren.

44:49.442 --> 44:50.882
And he set Fudge up
to be killed.

44:51.082 --> 44:53.122
What the fuck
are you talking about?

44:53.322 --> 44:55.122
Kem wouldn't fucking do that,
not to us.

44:55.242 --> 44:56.562
It's true, V.

44:56.722 --> 44:58.762
How the fuck do you know?
Who's saying this?

44:58.922 --> 45:00.658
Amanda caught him out,
and he admitted to it.

45:00.682 --> 45:01.682
When?

45:01.762 --> 45:03.202
Months ago.

45:08.202 --> 45:09.842
No. No.

45:10.002 --> 45:12.842
I don't fucking
believe this, Bren.

45:13.002 --> 45:16.042
I have to hear it from him.
Do you hear me?

45:16.242 --> 45:18.762
If he's admitted it,
I have to hear him say it.

45:18.922 --> 45:19.962
I'll ask him meself.

45:20.162 --> 45:22.522
You'll say fuck all to him.

45:22.722 --> 45:25.322
He thinks only Amanda, Jimmy,
and Michael know what he did,

45:25.522 --> 45:27.162
and I don't want him
twigging otherwise.

45:27.322 --> 45:29.002
I'd still be inside
if it wasn't for Kem.

45:29.162 --> 45:30.682
And Fudge would be alive.

45:32.802 --> 45:36.602
He's a fucking rat, just like
Ged Delaney was a rat,

45:36.802 --> 45:39.602
and rats get what they deserve.

45:43.362 --> 45:46.922
Now, you brought him
into this family, Eric,

45:47.122 --> 45:49.282
so you're gonna have to
clear this mess up.

45:49.442 --> 45:50.922
Bren...

45:54.722 --> 45:55.762
No.

46:00.202 --> 46:03.242
Fuck.

46:03.402 --> 46:06.042
Get Lee...

46:06.242 --> 46:07.442
or someone else to do it.

46:07.602 --> 46:09.642
I'll pay for it all.
Please.

46:09.842 --> 46:12.762
If you're not going to do this,
then fuck off out of here

46:12.882 --> 46:14.122
right now

46:14.242 --> 46:16.922
and don't come back.

46:17.082 --> 46:18.842
Go on.

46:19.042 --> 46:24.882
Fuck off, cos I have no fucking
time for windy cunts.

46:25.042 --> 46:27.082
I can either trust you
or I can't.

46:27.202 --> 46:28.602
You understand me?

46:35.282 --> 46:36.802
Yeah.

46:57.402 --> 46:59.178
Hope they're paying you
overtime, Paddy.

46:59.202 --> 47:01.122
What do you think?

47:03.042 --> 47:04.898
Look, I'm on that shooting
out past the airport,

47:04.922 --> 47:07.522
where Beady Donovan
and Jason Mahon were killed.

47:07.722 --> 47:10.122
Well, when we were going
through Donovan's belongings,

47:10.322 --> 47:12.802
we found this
in his jacket pocket.

47:13.002 --> 47:15.602
The original has Amanda
Kinsella's fingerprints on it.

47:15.762 --> 47:19.122
Could be a bank account
or a passcode or something.

47:19.322 --> 47:21.682
So, we thought you might
be interested.

47:21.842 --> 47:23.082
I am.

47:23.242 --> 47:24.722
Very.

47:24.882 --> 47:27.162
Let me know
how you get on, yeah?

47:27.322 --> 47:28.322
Hm.
