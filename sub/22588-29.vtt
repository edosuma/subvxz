I just saw the Bookworm.

- Are you sure?
- How can I mistake him?

00:53.606 --> 00:56.673
Those crazy clothes that look
like rare old book bindings.

00:56.675 --> 01:00.209
And I'm pretty sure he had on

The mere fact that

You...weren't at the ceremony

05:14.728 --> 05:16.728

commissioner?

05:16.730 --> 05:17.562
I was not.

05:17.564 --> 05:19.964
Thanks to a monumentally
stupid police officer

May I see that ticket,
commissioner?

05:46.019 --> 05:51.256
"Badge number 18-8-7."

05:51.757 --> 05:55.292
"Signed by, A.S. Scarlet."

05:55.294 --> 05:55.725
Wait.

05:55.727 --> 05:59.495
There is no badge 18-8-7
on the force.

05:59.629 --> 06:00.395
Of course not.

06:00.397 --> 06:03.631
A.S. Scarlet stands for
"A study in scarlet."

06:03.633 --> 06:08.569
A Sherlock Holmes adventure
novel first published in 1887.

06:08.571 --> 06:12.506
What a typical, twisted,
Bookworm joke.

06:13.074 --> 06:14.474
Bookworm?

06:14.476 --> 06:17.577
Say, what ...what is all this?

06:17.579 --> 06:19.478
Why are you here, Batman?

06:19.480 --> 06:22.280
To investigate your murder,
my friend.

06:22.282 --> 06:24.048
- What?
- 'At the bridge, this morning.'

06:24.050 --> 06:26.283
There was an imposter
made to look like you.

06:26.285 --> 06:29.052
He was apparently murdered
by a rifle bullet

06:29.054 --> 06:30.486
and fell into the river.

06:30.488 --> 06:31.220
Good grief.

06:31.222 --> 06:34.423
Then, that so called
policeman who pinched me--

06:34.425 --> 06:35.457
Another phony.

06:35.459 --> 06:36.524
Right, Robin.

06:36.526 --> 06:38.359
A mere illusion of death,
commissioner.

06:38.361 --> 06:42.563
Performed by an expert
high diver in Bookworm's pay.

06:42.565 --> 06:46.266
But why? What on earth
was the point of that charade?

06:46.268 --> 06:48.434
I don't know.
It could have been--

06:52.237 --> 06:55.072
The bomb detector of the
Batmobile. It's flashing red.

06:55.074 --> 06:58.141
Quick, hit the radio
control ejector button.

07:03.646 --> 07:05.513
Holy explosion.

07:12.187 --> 07:15.489
'Printer's Devil
to Bookworm headquarters.'

07:16.824 --> 07:19.158
'Devil to Bookworm.'

07:27.400 --> 07:29.534
'Devil to Bookworm.'

07:30.135 --> 07:32.803
I read you,
Printer's Devil.

07:35.506 --> 07:38.140
'Plot A, washout.'

07:38.142 --> 07:39.574
'He got rid of the bomb'

07:39.576 --> 07:42.276
'with a tricky ejector.'

07:42.278 --> 07:43.343
What about plot B?

07:43.345 --> 07:44.510
I don't know, Bookworm.

07:44.512 --> 07:47.145
It's still up in the air. It--

07:47.147 --> 07:49.347
Ah, there it comes now.

07:50.115 --> 07:53.717
What condition is it in?
Is my plot B legible?

07:56.420 --> 07:58.220
Perfectly.

07:59.488 --> 08:02.122
And here come
the bat-eared boobs, too.

08:02.124 --> 08:03.223
Return to headquarters.

08:03.225 --> 08:05.858
I read you,
over and out.

08:06.192 --> 08:07.725
Batman, look.

08:10.729 --> 08:11.729
Strange.

08:11.731 --> 08:15.499
A scorched, powder-burnt,
book cover.

08:15.501 --> 08:18.335
Seems to be made of asbestos.

08:20.204 --> 08:21.637
Excuse me, sir.

08:21.804 --> 08:23.237
Did you see
where this came from?

08:23.239 --> 08:26.306
Out of the sky, Batman.
Just after that explosion.

08:26.308 --> 08:30.643
Typical of the Bookworm to place
his lethal weapon inside a book.

08:30.645 --> 08:31.410
Bookworm?

08:31.412 --> 08:33.345
Sorry, citizen.
Police business.

08:33.347 --> 08:34.779
You'd better move along.

08:34.780 --> 08:36.313
Good luck, Batman.

08:36.315 --> 08:37.147
Thank you.

08:37.149 --> 08:38.414
You could still
read the cover.

08:38.416 --> 08:42.818
"For whom the bell tolls,
by Ernest Hemingway."

08:42.820 --> 08:46.656
It's the grimmest warning
we've ever had.

08:46.658 --> 08:47.923
Warning?

08:47.925 --> 08:49.424
Hemingway's title.

08:49.426 --> 08:51.626
It's from a poem by John Donne.

08:51.628 --> 08:55.630
"Do not ask for whom
the bell tolls."

08:56.798 --> 08:59.466
"It tolls for thee."

09:01.937 --> 09:04.471
Phew. No clues here, Batman.

09:04.473 --> 09:05.672
No secret writing.

09:05.674 --> 09:06.939
It's just what it looks like.

09:06.941 --> 09:09.875
A perfectly ordinary
asbestos book cover.

09:09.877 --> 09:13.011
Darn it all. I'm still positive
there's some reason

09:13.013 --> 09:15.580
why he chose
this particular book.

09:15.582 --> 09:17.648
Maybe it was the only one
of right size.

09:17.650 --> 09:23.053
No, Robin, no. You see, I know
how this fiend's mind works.

09:23.055 --> 09:25.422
He prepares every super-crime

09:25.424 --> 09:27.457
like the frustrated
novelist he is.

09:27.459 --> 09:30.560
Every page, every chapter
is an integral part

09:30.562 --> 09:32.461
of one stolen plot.

09:32.463 --> 09:36.031
Even that charade
at the bridge this morning..

09:36.799 --> 09:40.768
Great heavens. Of course.
The bridge.

09:40.770 --> 09:41.735
What, Batman?

09:41.737 --> 09:43.636
In "For whom the bell tolls"

09:43.638 --> 09:46.538
the hero's mission
is to blow up a bridge.

09:46.540 --> 09:49.107
Holy detonator. Let's go.

09:50.375 --> 09:51.808
What is a super-crime, boss?

09:51.810 --> 09:55.711
Silence. Back to your books.
You'll be told in good time.

09:55.713 --> 09:58.880
Oh, you're some
clever worm, Bookworm.

09:58.882 --> 10:03.017
Oh, oh. It's books,
my sweet lady.

10:03.019 --> 10:08.422
Books, books.
That's the secret of my success.

10:10.057 --> 10:12.892
Books.

10:12.894 --> 10:15.561
Oh, I read them all.

10:15.563 --> 10:17.729
I inherit the wisdom
of the ages.

10:17.731 --> 10:21.933
Every plot ever
devised is here.

10:21.935 --> 10:23.768
Inside my head.

10:23.770 --> 10:25.102
Oh, Bookworm.

10:25.104 --> 10:26.536
With a mind like yours

10:26.538 --> 10:29.873
I wonder why you don't write
your own bestseller.

10:29.875 --> 10:31.107
Shut up!

10:31.809 --> 10:33.942
Oh, don't you dare
say that to me.

10:33.944 --> 10:36.477
You-you're taunting me,
aren't you?

10:36.479 --> 10:40.080
- No, Bookworm.
- Yes, yes, you are taunting me.

10:40.082 --> 10:40.980
And why?

10:40.982 --> 10:44.516
Why? Because I have no
originality, that's why.

10:44.518 --> 10:49.120
Why? Because I am only
the master of stolen plots.

10:49.122 --> 10:49.920
Well.

10:49.922 --> 10:54.090
Well, this...this will teach
you a lesson.

11:19.048 --> 11:20.681
Hmm.

11:25.353 --> 11:26.485
Psst.

11:26.487 --> 11:28.119
What is he doing?

11:28.121 --> 11:29.186
With his fantastic mind

11:29.188 --> 11:33.456
he will read that entire book
in a matter of seconds.

11:53.610 --> 11:54.509
Now.

11:54.511 --> 11:57.712
What was I saying
before I was interrupted?

11:59.581 --> 12:01.114
Oh.

12:01.116 --> 12:02.348
Dear me.

12:02.350 --> 12:05.317
What feeble memories you have.

12:05.319 --> 12:06.685
Heh.

12:06.687 --> 12:07.719
However..

12:07.721 --> 12:11.055
...shades of Shakespeare.

12:11.057 --> 12:13.624
Night has fallen.

12:13.626 --> 12:18.595
It is time for us to put
a little twist into our plot.

12:18.597 --> 12:20.229
Follow me.

12:22.198 --> 12:24.566
There's one thing
I don't dig, Batman.

12:24.568 --> 12:27.402
Why does Bookworm wanna
blow up the new bridge?

12:27.404 --> 12:28.503
What's he getting out of it?

12:28.505 --> 12:30.338
Perhaps nothing but
twisted revenge.

12:30.340 --> 12:34.709
Revenge against a well
regulated society with..

12:34.711 --> 12:35.643
Look.

12:35.645 --> 12:37.311
On that cloud.

12:37.313 --> 12:39.479
'Wow. The Bat-signal.'

12:42.083 --> 12:43.315
Batmobile here.

12:43.317 --> 12:44.282
Thank heavens, Boy Wonder.

12:44.284 --> 12:46.584
A strange occurrence
has just been reported.

12:46.586 --> 12:47.418
'Where and what?'

12:47.420 --> 12:50.621
Back to that huge old
warehouse on Harbor Avenue.

12:50.623 --> 12:51.722
It involves a bridge.

12:51.724 --> 12:55.092
Say no more, commissioner.
We're on our way.

12:55.094 --> 12:57.027
Old warehouse,
Harbor Avenue.

12:57.029 --> 13:00.430
Hold tight.
Emergency Bat-turn.

13:05.803 --> 13:08.704
Robin, alert parachute pickup.

13:09.772 --> 13:11.506
Parachute pickup.

13:34.396 --> 13:35.396
Holy magic lantern.

13:35.398 --> 13:37.531
And a minced picture
of the new bridge.

13:37.533 --> 13:39.599
Yes, he's blown it up
all right.

13:39.601 --> 13:42.435
That photograph of the bridge.
It's hugely enlarged.

13:42.437 --> 13:44.537
Blown up,
in photographer's lingo.

13:44.539 --> 13:47.573
Gosh. What a tricky
play on words.

13:47.575 --> 13:49.841
- What's Bookworm's game?
- I don't know, Robin.

13:49.843 --> 13:51.542
The first thing is to find out

13:51.544 --> 13:53.143
where that hidden photo
projector is.

13:53.145 --> 13:55.778
Let's climb the wall
and get a bird's eye view.

13:55.780 --> 13:59.448
No. Wall's too high
to use the Bat-ropes.

13:59.450 --> 14:01.316
Let's use the Bat-zooka.

14:04.286 --> 14:05.286
'Pressman to Bookworm.

14:05.288 --> 14:08.389
They're getting ready
to climb the wall.'

14:08.391 --> 14:10.457
Bookworm to Pressman.

14:10.459 --> 14:12.792
Return to Bookmobile.

14:12.794 --> 14:14.260
Fire.

14:16.296 --> 14:19.164
- Holy bullseye.
- Let's go.

14:19.532 --> 14:25.103
I have the curious feeling this
all some kind of literary plot.

14:25.105 --> 14:26.571
Let's outwit him, Batman.

14:26.573 --> 14:27.738
Let's refuse to bite.

14:27.740 --> 14:29.239
We must, Robin. It's the--

14:29.241 --> 14:31.107
Are you Batman?
Oh, you must be.

14:31.109 --> 14:32.408
'Cause that's Robin.
Hi, Robin.

14:32.410 --> 14:34.243
'Yes, citizen,
but don't be alarmed.'

14:34.245 --> 14:36.712
'We're here on
official business.'

14:36.714 --> 14:39.147
Holy human flies.

14:45.154 --> 14:46.587
This ought to be high enough.

14:46.589 --> 14:48.188
Look. Down there,
in that other alley.

14:48.190 --> 14:51.157
Careful, Robin.
Both hands on the Bat-rope.

14:51.159 --> 14:54.160
- Sorry, Batman.
- You're right, though.

14:54.162 --> 14:56.162
The source of this giant
projected blow-up

14:56.164 --> 14:59.565
seems to be coming from
the roof of that parked van.

14:59.567 --> 15:01.767
Reverse Bat-climb.

15:11.711 --> 15:12.477
Odd.

15:12.479 --> 15:14.178
An abandoned Bookmobile.

15:14.180 --> 15:16.847
Could it really be one from
the Gotham City Public Library?

15:16.849 --> 15:21.084
I doubt it. Not with that photo
projector built into the roof.

15:21.086 --> 15:24.020
'I doubt whether it's entirely
abandoned, either.'

15:24.022 --> 15:26.989
You're right, Batman.
There must be someone inside

15:26.991 --> 15:28.423
to tend the projector.

15:28.425 --> 15:29.991
Let's give the worm a turn.

15:29.993 --> 15:33.094
We'll use
the ultrasonic Bat-ray.

15:34.529 --> 15:36.429
Bookmobile right in
the sights, Batman.

15:36.431 --> 15:38.431
How many decibels
will we give 'em?

15:38.433 --> 15:40.866
12000 DB's ought
to be sufficient.

15:40.868 --> 15:44.236
12000 decibels.
Here we go.

15:47.073 --> 15:50.008
- That's flushed them out.
- 'Six of them, two of us.

15:50.010 --> 15:51.943
Odd's in our favor.

15:57.649 --> 15:59.683
Hiro Jiwa's "Art of the attack."

15:59.685 --> 16:03.620
Page 14, chapter 6,
paragraph 2.

16:03.622 --> 16:05.355
Into action.

16:12.663 --> 16:14.563
Your glasses.

16:14.931 --> 16:18.700
Remember, never hit a man
with glasses.

16:27.743 --> 16:30.778
Shakespeare,
once more unto the breach.

16:52.534 --> 16:53.600
'Machiavelli's.'

16:53.602 --> 16:58.371
8. 3. 9. 6. Retreat.

17:09.348 --> 17:12.718
The cowardly worms.
Where are they going?

17:20.093 --> 17:22.794
Where worms always go.

17:23.862 --> 17:24.795
Down into the earth.

17:24.797 --> 17:27.564
They've wiggled through
that secret trap door.

17:27.566 --> 17:29.666
Doubtless, they had
it all prepared.

17:29.668 --> 17:30.633
But why, Batman?

17:30.635 --> 17:32.668
Why lure us here
and then run?

17:32.670 --> 17:33.702
Good question, Robin.

17:33.704 --> 17:34.536
One that's baffled us

17:34.538 --> 17:37.705
from the very beginning
of this case. Why?

17:38.039 --> 17:42.409
Perhaps there's a clue
to be found on that Bookmobile.

17:48.782 --> 17:50.015
Holy Cinderella.

17:50.017 --> 17:51.783
A beautiful prisoner.

17:51.785 --> 17:53.851
Just like a fairy tale.

17:53.853 --> 17:55.385
Let's free her.

17:55.387 --> 17:55.985
No.

17:55.987 --> 17:58.754
Wait a minute, Robin.

17:59.589 --> 18:02.090
Criminals have tried
this trick before.

18:02.092 --> 18:04.826
- Trick?
- Shh. Shh.

18:05.794 --> 18:06.493
The girl.

18:06.495 --> 18:07.560
Could be one of Bookworm's gang

18:07.562 --> 18:11.897
disguised as a prisoner
to give us false information.

18:12.698 --> 18:16.167
Gosh, Batman.
Those look like honest eyes.

18:16.169 --> 18:17.067
Huh.

18:17.069 --> 18:18.068
Never trust the old chestnut

18:18.070 --> 18:20.904
that crooks have
beady little eyes.

18:20.906 --> 18:22.005
It's false.

18:22.007 --> 18:26.009
I say we subject her
to the most rigid test.

18:26.011 --> 18:28.911
You mean, the Bat-cave?

18:29.445 --> 18:31.078
Precisely.

18:37.584 --> 18:38.150
I regret this

18:38.152 --> 18:40.152
but it's a precaution
I must take.

18:40.154 --> 18:43.088
I'm going to put you to sleep
for a little while.

18:43.090 --> 18:47.792
I give you my word there will be
no harmful after-effects.

18:53.700 --> 18:56.401
What...is your name?

18:57.369 --> 19:00.371
Lydia Lympet.

19:01.673 --> 19:04.608
'Do you know where you are?'

19:04.742 --> 19:06.309
Of course.

19:06.311 --> 19:11.681
I'm in the back of
Bookworm's Bookmobile.

19:12.916 --> 19:13.815
It rings true, Batman.

19:13.817 --> 19:17.251
She doesn't even realize
she's in the Bat-cave.

19:17.385 --> 19:19.919
Get set for the big one.

19:21.021 --> 19:23.889
What is Bookworm's plot?

19:24.290 --> 19:26.791
I don't know.

19:27.025 --> 19:30.994
He hasn't confided it to us.

19:31.996 --> 19:34.964
Darn it all.
Another true answer.

19:34.966 --> 19:39.301
I only know he can't pull it off

19:39.303 --> 19:43.705
till Batman and Robin
have perished.

19:44.339 --> 19:47.374
Turn that machine off.

19:49.677 --> 19:51.611
What are we gonna do,
Batman?

19:51.613 --> 19:53.679
Only one thing we can do.

19:53.681 --> 19:57.382
And quickly, before
that Bat-gas wears off.

19:58.617 --> 20:00.517
She's waking up.

20:04.722 --> 20:05.455
Batman?

20:05.457 --> 20:07.890
Oh, thank heavens,
you've rescued me

20:07.892 --> 20:10.692
from that slimy fiend,
the Bookworm.

20:10.694 --> 20:12.794
Any idea what his
plot is, ma'am?

20:12.796 --> 20:16.030
Oh, yes.
I overheard it all.

20:16.032 --> 20:18.866
He plans to strike at midnight.

20:18.868 --> 20:21.501
Where, ma'am?

20:21.503 --> 20:22.635
It's just awful.

20:22.637 --> 20:26.071
You know that perfect replica
of Independence Hall?

20:26.073 --> 20:27.939
'The one built
for the exposition?'

20:27.941 --> 20:34.045
Well, he plans to steal
the priceless documents there.

20:34.047 --> 20:35.613
The original..

20:35.615 --> 20:37.881
...United States..

20:37.883 --> 20:42.318
...Declaration
of Independence.

20:43.186 --> 20:45.320
This poor girl's
had a very bad time.

20:45.322 --> 20:48.656
We better call an ambulance
on the mobile Bat-phone.

20:48.658 --> 20:52.393
Batman, Robin,
please don't leave me!

20:54.229 --> 20:57.731
- Another trap, of course.
- You could say that again.

20:57.733 --> 21:00.501
Another trap, and I intend
to walk right into it.

21:00.503 --> 21:01.668
What?

21:02.170 --> 21:03.569
It's the only way, Robin.

21:03.571 --> 21:05.237
We know The Bookworm's
waiting there.

21:05.239 --> 21:07.038
With his shotgun
loaded for bats.

21:07.040 --> 21:10.574
True. But he doesn't know
that I know.

21:10.576 --> 21:12.776
You stay here
and guard that crooked girl.

21:12.778 --> 21:14.177
I'll call
Chief O'Hara en route

21:14.179 --> 21:15.778
and have him send
reinforcements.

21:15.780 --> 21:19.047
Ambulance on the way, ma'am.

21:23.585 --> 21:26.053
Won't be long,
Miss Limpet.

21:27.555 --> 21:28.988
While we wait..

21:28.990 --> 21:31.590
...why don't you
untie me, hmm?

21:31.592 --> 21:32.791
I don't know if I should.

21:32.793 --> 21:34.993
I mean, you might
be injured, Miss Limpet.

21:34.995 --> 21:38.930
Better not move until
trained personnel arrives.

21:39.298 --> 21:41.999
Well, then, how about
reading me a book?

21:42.001 --> 21:45.936
Say that fourth one
on the end of the shelf.

21:45.938 --> 21:47.837
Sure thing, Miss Limpet.

21:47.839 --> 21:51.307
- This one?
- No, no, no, the next one.

21:54.911 --> 21:56.778
"Complete English history?"

21:56.780 --> 22:00.214
This kind of stuff
always puts me to sleep.

22:16.863 --> 22:19.064
Limpet to Bookworm, urgent.

22:19.066 --> 22:22.233
'Do you read me?
Am I legible?'

22:25.937 --> 22:28.805
'Repeat. Am I legible?'

22:28.807 --> 22:30.206
Ahem, I read you.

22:30.208 --> 22:33.842
Warning. Batman knows
it's a trap.

22:33.844 --> 22:34.909
Uh, how could he?

22:34.911 --> 22:39.914
I don't know. But get this.
The Boy Wonder knows my name.

22:39.916 --> 22:42.182
He's been calling
me Miss limpet.

22:42.184 --> 22:44.617
'They must've tumbled somehow.'

22:44.619 --> 22:47.753
Uh, look, do you still
have Boy Wonder?

22:47.755 --> 22:48.386
Oh, yes.

22:48.388 --> 22:51.655
He got a whiff of your
sleepy-bye book

22:51.657 --> 22:52.288
"English history."

22:52.290 --> 22:56.258
Stay right there. I'll be
right over to pick you up.

22:56.260 --> 22:58.059
'Over and out.'

23:01.930 --> 23:07.401
<i> A strange destination</i>
<i> for a dreadful fate.</i>

23:07.403 --> 23:10.170
<i> The Wayne Memorial clock tower.</i>

23:10.172 --> 23:11.371
<i> Presented to Gotham City</i>

23:11.373 --> 23:14.807
<i> in memory of</i>
<i> Bruce Wayne's father.</i>

23:14.809 --> 23:17.810
'Time. Time.'

23:17.812 --> 23:21.647
'Which delivers us all
to the worms in the end.'

23:25.350 --> 23:26.149
What time is it?

23:26.151 --> 23:30.119
Oh. One minute
to midnight, Bookworm.

23:30.121 --> 23:31.153
Ah!

23:31.155 --> 23:36.224
Sixty tiny seconds.
Oh, farewell, Boy Wonder.

23:36.226 --> 23:42.230
<i> 'Adieu, Robin. Oh, this is</i>
<i> the last time you will meddle'</i>

23:42.232 --> 23:43.898
'in affairs of moment.'

23:43.900 --> 23:46.700
Oh, I tried to warn you.

23:46.702 --> 23:50.937
"Do not ask for whom
this bell tolls.

23:50.939 --> 23:53.205
It tolls for thee."

24:05.084 --> 24:07.417
Holy headache!

24:07.419 --> 24:09.185
<i> Holy midnight!</i>

24:09.187 --> 24:12.188
<i> The first minute</i>
<i> of the new day.</i>

24:12.190 --> 24:15.224
<i> The everlasting end for Robin.</i>

24:15.226 --> 24:18.894
<i> Stick merciful cotton</i>
<i> in your ears.</i>

24:18.896 --> 24:22.430
<i> The death-knell</i>
<i> sounds tomorrow.</i>

24:22.432 --> 24:24.265
<i> Same Bat-time.</i>

24:24.267 --> 24:27.134
