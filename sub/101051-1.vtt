[piano playing upbeat tune]

01:19.013 --> 01:20.015
[snoring]

01:24.014 --> 01:26.009
-[man moaning]
-[audience laughing
and cheering]

01:38.008 --> 01:39.023
[man continues moaning]

01:48.006 --> 01:50.023
Get out of my way!
I need a sprinkle.

01:51.022 --> 01:53.010
[zipper unzips]

01:53.012 --> 01:56.008
[announcer speaks
indistinctly]

01:56.010 --> 02:01.009
[announcer] But now, the putrid
little primate, you shelled out
your shekels to see,

02:01.011 --> 02:02.015
[drum roll]

02:02.017 --> 02:06.003
All right, looks like
you're up, girly.

02:06.005 --> 02:08.023
[ringmaster]
And here she comes now.

02:10.000 --> 02:12.002
An hideous curiosity,

02:12.004 --> 02:16.008
captured deep in the icy
Yukon wilderness,

02:16.010 --> 02:18.006
where legends say...

02:18.008 --> 02:20.011
she is the cursed progeny

02:20.013 --> 02:24.004
of a witch
and a mountain beast.

02:25.016 --> 02:29.014
Bestowed with gifts
most unnatural,

02:29.016 --> 02:35.003
and born with looks
that will surely
stain your memories

02:35.005 --> 02:37.010
for years to come.

02:38.019 --> 02:43.005
The Ape-Faced Girl!

02:43.007 --> 02:44.023
[audience gasping]

02:45.001 --> 02:46.012
[woman laughs]

02:49.006 --> 02:50.023
[audience gasps]

02:51.001 --> 02:53.005
[man] I got something else
long and sweet for you,
monkey girl.

02:53.007 --> 02:54.021
-[audience laughs]
-[ringmaster] Calm yourselves.

02:54.023 --> 02:57.000
Calm yourselves,
ladies and gents.

02:57.002 --> 03:00.012
There is much more to see,
of this I can promise you.

03:00.014 --> 03:03.000
She just needs
a little darkness

03:03.002 --> 03:05.005
to calm herself,
concentrate,

03:05.007 --> 03:09.015
and conjure up
a very special
friend of hers.

03:09.017 --> 03:14.021
Behold! An animal the likes
of which you have never
seen before.

03:14.023 --> 03:18.001
A beast from
a time long forgotten.

03:18.003 --> 03:20.014
I know you don't like it,

03:20.016 --> 03:23.005
but it will be over quickly
if you behave.

03:23.007 --> 03:25.016
[ringmaster]
A ferocious monster...

03:25.018 --> 03:28.001
tethered to her

03:28.003 --> 03:30.000
deranged mind!

03:30.002 --> 03:32.000
We just have to do
as he says.

03:32.002 --> 03:35.010
The Ape Girl's
gruesome pet...

03:37.005 --> 03:38.021
-[low growl]
-[audience gasps]

03:38.023 --> 03:40.003
[ringmaster]
No sudden movements

03:40.005 --> 03:42.000
if you please,
ladies and gents,

03:42.002 --> 03:44.016
for this is no tame
circus animal.

03:44.018 --> 03:47.017
This is a true
wicked conjuring,

03:47.019 --> 03:52.007
with teeth that can
rip through a human skull.

03:52.009 --> 03:55.006
-[woman laughs]
-Would you like to
watch him dance?

03:55.008 --> 03:56.022
[people clapping]

03:57.000 --> 03:58.019
Give us a twirl.

03:58.021 --> 04:00.023
-[creature's feet thumping]
-[announcer] Go on, now!

04:01.001 --> 04:02.011
[audience laughs]

04:02.013 --> 04:04.016
[cheers and applause]

04:04.018 --> 04:06.018
[sniffles]
We'll be done soon.

04:08.005 --> 04:09.009
I promise.

04:09.011 --> 04:11.003
[ringmaster]
Around the other way!

04:11.005 --> 04:12.021
[creature growls]

04:12.023 --> 04:14.002
What's wrong?

04:14.004 --> 04:15.015
-[low snarl]
-What are you doing?

04:16.017 --> 04:18.002
Who are you looking at?

04:19.018 --> 04:21.011
-[growls]
-I said the other way!

04:21.013 --> 04:22.018
-[whip lashes]
-[growls]

04:22.020 --> 04:24.017
-No!
-[ringmaster] You will obey me!

04:24.019 --> 04:26.003
-[crowd screams]
-[ringmaster grunts]

04:28.017 --> 04:30.014
You little cunt!

04:30.016 --> 04:32.019
Control your animal!

04:32.021 --> 04:34.009
[man] Take it down!

04:34.011 --> 04:35.022
-[thump]
-[creature moans]

04:36.000 --> 04:37.003

[creature]
<i>Make stop.</i>

04:44.000 --> 04:45.009
Who is this?

04:46.013 --> 04:48.000
Which one are you?

04:48.002 --> 04:49.011
<i>Help...</i>

04:50.008 --> 04:51.018
<i>girl...</i>

04:52.015 --> 04:54.009
What do you mean?

04:56.012 --> 04:57.020
Help us how?

04:57.022 --> 05:01.008
<i>Make wish.</i>

05:01.010 --> 05:02.019
What?

05:03.015 --> 05:04.019
Ow!

05:06.000 --> 05:08.020
<i>Make wish.</i>

05:13.018 --> 05:15.002
[meekly] I...

05:15.018 --> 05:19.020
<i>Save girl.</i>

05:25.003 --> 05:27.005
[people screaming]

05:28.004 --> 05:29.023
[people continue screaming]

05:34.014 --> 05:35.020

05:38.022 --> 05:40.000
<i>Girl...</i>

05:40.002 --> 05:41.011
[clattering]

05:41.013 --> 05:42.023
<i>Safe.</i>

[metal creaking]

05:48.005 --> 05:49.020

[creature growls softly]

06:37.014 --> 06:40.013
[Dorothy] <i>With sunrise,</i>
<i>another day begins.</i>

06:41.020 --> 06:44.013
So let's be ready
for today.

06:45.021 --> 06:47.018
No wicked words,

06:48.011 --> 06:49.017
no teeth,

06:50.008 --> 06:52.011
no claws.

06:52.013 --> 06:57.009
Only fun and laughs
and play.

06:57.011 --> 06:59.009
Well, of course we can.

06:59.011 --> 07:02.017
But first we have to say
good morning to
all our new friends.

07:03.017 --> 07:04.021
Don't we?

07:05.009 --> 07:06.021
[laughs]

07:06.023 --> 07:10.010
You haven't
forgotten them, silly.
You can't have.

07:11.016 --> 07:14.000
Oh, you're
being ridiculous.

07:14.002 --> 07:15.019
[chuckles softly]

07:15.021 --> 07:18.000
All right, all right.

07:18.002 --> 07:19.002
Let's see.

07:19.004 --> 07:20.013
[Cliff] God dammit!

07:20.015 --> 07:23.017
[Dorothy]
<i>Tall as a house.</i>
<i>Mad as a lion.</i>

07:23.019 --> 07:25.000
[Cliff] Piece of shit!

07:25.002 --> 07:26.006
[Dorothy]
<i>The big funny tin man...</i>

07:26.008 --> 07:27.018
[Cliff] Mother... Ugh!

07:27.020 --> 07:29.019
[Dorothy] <i>...with lots of</i>
<i>pretty fast cars.</i>

07:29.021 --> 07:31.023
[Cliff] Stupid bitch ass...
Fuck... God damn...

07:32.001 --> 07:33.008
[Dorothy chuckles]

07:33.010 --> 07:35.019
<i>And lots and lots of</i>
<i>pretty words.</i>

07:35.021 --> 07:37.017
[Cliff]
Fuck, fuck, fuck!

07:38.021 --> 07:40.019
[Dorothy]
<i>And there's a sad girl...</i>

07:40.021 --> 07:43.013
<i>who sings out</i>
<i>to the dark.</i>

07:43.015 --> 07:46.014
<i>She doesn't</i>
<i>sing much anymore.</i>

07:46.016 --> 07:51.012
<i>Well, she doesn't do much</i>
<i>of anything these days,</i>
<i>really.</i>

07:55.000 --> 07:57.016
<i>Oh, and you must remember,</i>

07:57.018 --> 07:59.020
<i>the boy hero.</i>

08:01.004 --> 08:02.020
[gasping]

08:02.022 --> 08:04.000
<i>That's right.</i>

08:04.002 --> 08:06.002
<i>A proper superhero.</i>

08:09.016 --> 08:11.012
<i>And last of all,</i>

08:11.014 --> 08:13.018
<i>there's the fair princess.</i>

08:14.022 --> 08:18.009
<i>She's got skin</i>
<i>made of rubber.</i>

08:20.000 --> 08:23.016
<i>At least... that's what</i>
<i>I've been told.</i>

08:26.009 --> 08:29.002
<i>But when she</i>
<i>smiles sometimes,</i>

08:29.004 --> 08:31.019
<i>I think she might actually</i>
<i>be made of glass.</i>

08:33.009 --> 08:34.015
[sighs in exasperation]

08:40.001 --> 08:42.022
<i>No, I'm not</i>
<i>scared of them.</i>

08:43.000 --> 08:45.005
<i>Why would I be?</i>

08:45.007 --> 08:47.015
<i>This is a special place.</i>

08:48.017 --> 08:50.009
<i>It's where we belong now.</i>

08:51.011 --> 08:53.015
<i>And this is who</i>
<i>we belong with.</i>

08:55.011 --> 08:59.001
<i>Maybe we're not</i>
<i>all friends just yet...</i>

08:59.003 --> 09:02.003
<i>but I just know</i>
<i>we will be eventually.</i>

09:02.005 --> 09:05.022
<i>Someday we might even be</i>
<i>better than friends.</i>

09:07.009 --> 09:11.010
<i>Maybe someday,</i>
<i>we'll be a family.</i>

09:14.022 --> 09:17.002
[gentle instrumental music
playing]

09:17.004 --> 09:18.016
[timer ticking]

09:56.016 --> 09:57.022
[exhales]

09:58.015 --> 09:59.017
Perfect.

10:00.013 --> 10:01.017
[bell dinging]

10:01.019 --> 10:03.016
[Niles]
Rise and shine, everyone.

10:03.018 --> 10:06.010
Rise and shine.

10:06.012 --> 10:09.006
Must you wake us
every morning
with that bell?

10:09.008 --> 10:10.011
It's so folksy.

10:10.013 --> 10:12.008
No more bells
after today, Rita.

10:12.010 --> 10:13.012
I promise.

10:14.007 --> 10:15.020
[Vic] It's ready?

10:15.022 --> 10:18.004
Larry is completing
his final test
on the substance

10:18.006 --> 10:20.002
as we speak.

10:20.004 --> 10:22.011
[Cliff] And it's definitely
gonna work this time, right?

10:23.018 --> 10:25.020
Unlike every other time?

10:26.013 --> 10:27.017
[timer rings]

10:31.009 --> 10:32.011
[Larry] All right, buddy.

10:32.013 --> 10:34.000
-[ribbiting]
-No pressure...

10:34.021 --> 10:36.008
but we're counting on you.

10:40.006 --> 10:41.008
[frog ribbits]

10:42.021 --> 10:43.022
Anything?

10:44.015 --> 10:45.021
[alarm beeping]

10:46.011 --> 10:47.013
Shit!

10:47.015 --> 10:49.004
Shit, shit, shit!

10:49.006 --> 10:50.017
[groans, sighs]

10:53.000 --> 10:54.018
Oh, God!

11:00.012 --> 11:01.021
[exhales]

11:03.021 --> 11:06.010
[Niles]
<i>This is important.</i>

11:06.012 --> 11:10.013
The transformation could
prove to be very exhausting,

11:10.015 --> 11:12.015
and could take up to
several hours.

11:12.017 --> 11:14.011
[Vic] Wait,
did you just say "hours"?

11:14.013 --> 11:17.003
[Niles] It's a very delicate
and intricate process.

11:17.005 --> 11:21.011
The chemical needs time
to permeate each and every
cell of the body.

11:21.013 --> 11:25.002
[Cliff] I'm no asshole
scientist with a God-complex
or anything,

11:25.004 --> 11:28.009
but what about those of us
who don't have a body?

11:28.011 --> 11:30.000
Well, my theory is that

11:30.002 --> 11:33.001
the chemical
will interact with
carbon structures.

11:33.003 --> 11:35.020
-Meaning--
-[Cliff] Nope,
not buying it.

11:35.022 --> 11:38.011
What, you guys really think
he's just suddenly capable

11:38.013 --> 11:40.001
of reversing this bullshit?

11:40.003 --> 11:41.010
He's had days, weeks.

11:41.012 --> 11:42.019
Nothing's happened,

11:42.021 --> 11:44.015
and it sure as shit
ain't gonna happen today.

11:44.017 --> 11:45.016
[Vic] You don't know that.

11:45.018 --> 11:46.018
[Cliff] Yeah, I do.

11:46.020 --> 11:48.014
He's a shitty scientist.

11:48.016 --> 11:49.018
Look around you, Vic.

11:49.020 --> 11:52.008
We are his fucking
life's work.

11:52.010 --> 11:54.005
What does that tell you?

11:54.007 --> 11:58.002
You look here, you great big
steaming, reeking pile
of regurgitated--

11:58.004 --> 11:59.017
[Larry] Pancakes!

11:59.019 --> 12:00.023
Thank God.

12:01.001 --> 12:03.004
-I'm starving.
-[Niles] Good. Breakfast.

12:03.006 --> 12:04.019
We'll need our strength.

12:04.021 --> 12:08.001
So everyone,
make sure you fuel up
before we begin.

12:08.003 --> 12:09.014
[Larry] Uh... Chief.

12:13.003 --> 12:16.007
[Cliff] I called it.
I fucking called it!

12:19.009 --> 12:20.020
Thank you, Larry!

12:20.022 --> 12:22.009
Please, everybody sit down.

12:22.011 --> 12:24.001
Let's sit down together.

12:28.000 --> 12:29.006
[Larry] Oh, boy.

12:29.008 --> 12:31.015
[Niles] Jane,
Baby Doll's favorite.

12:32.007 --> 12:33.011
Extra syrup.

12:35.012 --> 12:36.023
She's not hungry.

12:43.013 --> 12:45.001
I'm sorry, Rita.

12:46.016 --> 12:49.021
Do you think it might be time
to try something else?

12:49.023 --> 12:51.022
If science isn't working,

12:52.000 --> 12:53.021
maybe we should
look elsewhere.

12:53.023 --> 12:56.005
After all, what happened
to us in that painting

12:56.007 --> 12:59.012
wasn't completely
scientific.

13:03.013 --> 13:05.001
Magic.

13:05.003 --> 13:08.007
I'm not exactly overjoyed
at the thought of
seeing him either,

13:08.009 --> 13:11.008
but Willoughby might
have an answer.

13:11.010 --> 13:12.017
-No.
-At the very least,

13:12.019 --> 13:14.003
he could point us
in the direction

13:14.005 --> 13:15.016
of a book, or a boy,

13:15.018 --> 13:18.023
-or a horsehead.
She seemed nice--
-No!

13:19.001 --> 13:22.020
Look, I'm sorry, Rita,
but he can't help.

13:22.022 --> 13:24.010
Not with this.

13:28.020 --> 13:31.017
[Cliff] Fuck, fuck,
fuck, fuck!

13:31.019 --> 13:33.000
[Dorothy]
What are you doing?

13:33.002 --> 13:34.013
[Cliff] Uh...
Nothing.

13:34.015 --> 13:36.013
I know what you're up to.

13:36.015 --> 13:38.008
You're going to
feed the rats.

13:40.008 --> 13:41.016
-[Cliff] Sure.
-Can I come?

13:41.018 --> 13:42.020
[Cliff] Nope.

14:08.023 --> 14:10.018
Cheese delivery.

14:12.002 --> 14:14.021
I know you want it,
motherfucker.

14:14.023 --> 14:16.006
[rat sniffing]

14:16.008 --> 14:17.016
Come on.

14:17.018 --> 14:19.000
Come on.

14:19.002 --> 14:20.010
[rat screeching]

14:23.013 --> 14:25.014
Squeak, squeak, motherfucker!

14:25.016 --> 14:26.023
Oh, yeah!

15:00.005 --> 15:01.019
[Hammerhead]
You can't keep
doing this.

15:03.000 --> 15:05.008
You see what's it's
doing to us, right?

15:07.014 --> 15:10.016
Forgive me
if I don't want to deal,
Hammerhead.

15:10.018 --> 15:12.018
We're stuck on a toy.

15:12.020 --> 15:15.004
God, I could rip
your fucking face off!

15:20.008 --> 15:24.010
It's not about we,
or you, or me.

15:24.012 --> 15:27.002
It's about the girl.
It's about Kay.

15:27.004 --> 15:28.023
Or have you fucking
forgotten that?

15:29.022 --> 15:31.003
Fuck you.

15:41.000 --> 15:42.002
Who did this?

15:46.012 --> 15:47.021
[shouts]
Who did this?

15:47.023 --> 15:49.003
[echoes]

15:58.021 --> 16:00.005
[gasping]

16:06.000 --> 16:07.016
[Dorothy]
Did I hurt you?

16:09.010 --> 16:11.002
What the hell
are you doing in here?

16:11.004 --> 16:14.009
Sorry. I was just
trying to help.

16:14.011 --> 16:17.021
I saw it was stuck in
and it looked really painful.

16:17.023 --> 16:19.018
So you just barge into
my personal space?

16:19.020 --> 16:22.013
-I--
-You can't just walk in here
whenever you want.

16:27.022 --> 16:29.004
Fuck.

16:30.004 --> 16:31.014
I'm sorry.

16:31.016 --> 16:33.001
I didn't mean to
blow up at you.

16:33.003 --> 16:34.005
It's okay.

16:34.007 --> 16:36.006
I know being
a grown-up is hard,

16:36.008 --> 16:39.020
and sometimes
you have to yell to get
all the bad feelings out.

16:40.015 --> 16:42.008
Yeah, well...

16:42.010 --> 16:45.014
being a grown-up doesn't
give you a pass
on being an asshole.

16:45.016 --> 16:46.020
[chuckles]

16:47.020 --> 16:49.006
Shush, you!

16:49.008 --> 16:51.019
I know it's
a naughty word.

16:54.004 --> 16:55.012
Who are you talking to?

16:57.018 --> 17:02.000
Darling and Herschel.

17:02.002 --> 17:03.023
-Who?
-My friends.

17:04.001 --> 17:06.013
You can't see them right now,
because they're inside.

17:07.019 --> 17:09.017
Just like your friends.

17:10.018 --> 17:12.015
The ones inside
your head.

17:15.006 --> 17:16.007
[Niles] Dorothy?

17:16.009 --> 17:18.007
Being a little busybody,
are we?

17:18.009 --> 17:19.011
It's fine, we were just--

17:19.013 --> 17:20.023
Why don't you
go out and play

17:21.001 --> 17:23.011
and let Jane and I
have a little grown-up chat?

17:23.013 --> 17:25.004
But Darling was
just saying that--

17:25.006 --> 17:27.022
[Niles] Just a moment,
sweetheart.

17:28.000 --> 17:29.010
[Dorothy] Okay.

17:41.020 --> 17:43.021
What do you want?

17:43.023 --> 17:46.010
Well, if you're gonna
get right to it...

17:46.012 --> 17:48.011
I need the serum.

17:48.013 --> 17:50.013
The one Josh Clay gave you.

17:50.015 --> 17:53.009
I know you've been using it,
and I'm not here to lecture.

17:53.011 --> 17:54.014
I just want it back...

17:55.012 --> 17:56.012
for Dorothy.

17:58.022 --> 18:00.006
For Dorothy?

18:00.008 --> 18:01.013
To keep her safe.

18:01.015 --> 18:03.006
That's why it was created
in the first place,

18:03.008 --> 18:05.018
as a... safety net.

18:06.016 --> 18:07.019
It's gone.

18:08.021 --> 18:09.023
I used it all.

18:11.021 --> 18:13.006
[Niles clicks tongue]

18:14.008 --> 18:16.009
[sighs deeply] Right.

18:21.002 --> 18:22.006
Jane...

18:23.019 --> 18:25.021
if you need to
talk to someone,

18:25.023 --> 18:30.011
or scream
and shout at someone,
as the case may be...

18:30.013 --> 18:32.005
I want you to know
I'm here.

18:34.006 --> 18:36.007
I'll always be here
for you.

18:38.018 --> 18:40.003
Wow.

18:43.001 --> 18:46.008
Part of me actually
wishes we were
back there, you know.

18:49.004 --> 18:51.013
Where that didn't sound
like total bullshit.

18:53.006 --> 18:54.021
Show's over, Chief.

18:55.016 --> 18:58.010
You're not my friend.

18:58.012 --> 19:02.001
You're just a scientist
who did fucked-up things
to a broken girl.

19:16.021 --> 19:18.019
[gentle orchestral music
playing]

19:29.006 --> 19:32.015
[woman] <i>I don't think</i>
<i>I've seen your son</i>
<i>work harder on anything</i>

19:32.017 --> 19:34.003
<i>in his entire life.</i>

19:34.019 --> 19:36.008
Is that right?

19:36.010 --> 19:39.014
Gary, you ready
to show Dad
what you made?

19:39.016 --> 19:41.009
Okay, bud.

19:41.011 --> 19:42.021
Moment of truth.

19:42.023 --> 19:45.002
Okay, wow!

19:45.004 --> 19:46.021
Will you look at that!

19:46.023 --> 19:48.003
It's an airplane.

19:48.005 --> 19:51.005
Not just an airplane,
right, Gar?

19:51.007 --> 19:52.023
It's the X-15.

19:53.001 --> 19:54.002
Get out!

19:54.004 --> 19:55.007
[chuckles] Hey!

19:55.009 --> 19:57.012
Just like the one
Dad's flying into space.

19:57.014 --> 19:59.004
Okay, let's see here.

20:00.015 --> 20:02.021
Two wings, check.

20:02.023 --> 20:05.010
Well, there's my cockpit.
Check.

20:09.003 --> 20:12.007
Okay. How about you tell me
what this is, right here?

20:13.006 --> 20:14.006
[whooshing]

20:14.008 --> 20:16.007
[both laughing]

20:16.009 --> 20:18.021
Okay, I guess you mean
this is the rocket engine,
huh?

20:18.023 --> 20:21.016
Without this, Dad doesn't
go into space.

20:22.011 --> 20:24.003
Which is why,

20:24.005 --> 20:26.019
it's very important
to understand exactly
where it goes,

20:26.021 --> 20:28.021
and why.

20:28.023 --> 20:30.016
But I liked it
where it was.

20:30.018 --> 20:31.022
[Larry]
Hold on a minute.

20:32.015 --> 20:34.010
Just watch.

20:34.012 --> 20:36.003
Does it really matter, Lar?

20:36.005 --> 20:37.021
[Larry] I don't know, Cheryl.

20:37.023 --> 20:40.002
Do you want your
husband's plane to break
the Earth's atmosphere,

20:40.004 --> 20:42.001
or break into
a million pieces?

20:51.020 --> 20:53.009
Tell you what.

20:53.011 --> 20:55.017
Go fetch some cardboard,
some scissors.
We'll start over.

20:55.019 --> 20:57.005
You and me.

21:04.013 --> 21:05.021
It was a present

21:05.023 --> 21:07.019
to show how proud
he was of his dad.

21:07.021 --> 21:10.020
And now his dad
is gonna teach him how
to do it the right way.

21:10.022 --> 21:11.023
[scoffs]

21:12.001 --> 21:13.009
That's funny.

21:13.011 --> 21:15.001
I thought he did
do it the right way.

21:22.009 --> 21:23.023
[gasps]

21:24.001 --> 21:25.012
Whoa.

21:27.001 --> 21:30.009
Is there a reason
you're showing me
that, pal?

21:30.011 --> 21:34.001
[sighs] Maybe it's
the universe telling us
we need a break.

21:44.008 --> 21:45.011
[door creaking]

21:52.015 --> 21:53.021
Yeah.

21:53.023 --> 21:56.004
You stay right where
you are, you bastards.

22:03.005 --> 22:04.010
[grunts]

22:07.015 --> 22:08.020
[grunts]

22:09.021 --> 22:11.009
Where were you?

22:12.023 --> 22:14.012
Why, did I miss
anything?

22:16.003 --> 22:19.003
Maybe I would be
further along
with my training

22:19.005 --> 22:20.015
if I had
a consistent teacher.

22:20.017 --> 22:22.006
Hmm?

22:22.008 --> 22:26.011
Is it so wrong to
desire simple mastery
of one's limbs?

22:26.013 --> 22:29.006
After 60 years
of watching myself

22:29.008 --> 22:32.020
puddle into a pool
of shame and self-loathing,

22:32.022 --> 22:34.005
to finally ask

22:34.007 --> 22:37.002
not what I can do
for my body,

22:37.004 --> 22:40.004
but what my body can
do for me?

22:40.006 --> 22:42.001
Sure. What's your end game?

22:42.003 --> 22:44.021
Maybe, eventually,
when we claw ourselves

22:44.023 --> 22:47.006
out of this
miniature morass,

22:47.008 --> 22:52.008
maybe I can devote myself
to the better good.

22:52.010 --> 22:54.014
So you wanna become
a superhero.

22:54.016 --> 22:56.007
That's what all
this training's about?

22:56.009 --> 22:57.016
[laughs awkwardly]
What?

22:58.005 --> 22:59.016
No!

23:00.005 --> 23:01.019
Why?

23:01.021 --> 23:04.012
Is that ridiculous
to you?

23:04.014 --> 23:07.015
You've never heard
such a foolish thing,
have you?

23:08.006 --> 23:10.020
If it were true,

23:12.001 --> 23:13.017
did you think that maybe,

23:13.019 --> 23:17.007
just maybe my only aim here
was to keep off
the Tiny Town 10?

23:17.009 --> 23:20.019
I was just making sure
I'm managing expectations.

23:20.021 --> 23:22.020
You know you could never
actually cut it, right?

23:23.022 --> 23:25.006
[liquid dripping]

23:30.014 --> 23:32.006
Try that arm now.

23:32.008 --> 23:33.014
What?

23:40.006 --> 23:41.018
[sighs]

23:44.005 --> 23:45.012
[yells]

23:48.013 --> 23:50.011
[panting]

23:50.013 --> 23:52.023
Now just find a way to do it
without being insulted.

23:54.004 --> 23:55.022
Same time tomorrow.

23:58.009 --> 23:59.011
[exhales]

24:01.010 --> 24:03.009
You are Cliff fucking Steele.

24:03.011 --> 24:07.015
And he is a hillbilly
piece of shit can't
keep his dick in his pants.

24:07.017 --> 24:09.004
[radio playing]

24:09.006 --> 24:10.021
You don't need this.

24:10.023 --> 24:13.006
Not when you are finally
starting to hit your stride.

24:13.008 --> 24:14.007
I know.

24:14.009 --> 24:16.001
And with a baby on the way.

24:16.003 --> 24:18.004
I know.

24:18.006 --> 24:22.011
[Kate] I cannot believe your
mama stayed with his cheating
ass as long as she did.

24:22.013 --> 24:24.008
This is gonna
break his heart.

24:24.021 --> 24:26.002
Honey...

24:28.006 --> 24:29.013
[Cliff sighs]

24:30.002 --> 24:31.010
All right.

24:31.012 --> 24:33.009
Why don't you
go lie down...

24:33.011 --> 24:34.015
with the burrito,

24:34.017 --> 24:37.009
and, uh, I'll talk to him.
I got this.

24:41.008 --> 24:42.012
Fuck him.

24:42.014 --> 24:44.008
[radio continues playing]

24:59.005 --> 25:00.015
Slow down there, Pops.

25:02.007 --> 25:04.022
You're giving my pit boys
a run for their money.

25:05.000 --> 25:06.014
When's lunch?

25:06.016 --> 25:09.003
Ready to eat the ass
off a low-flying duck.

25:09.005 --> 25:11.015
Kate's inside
putting up her feet.

25:11.017 --> 25:13.009
I got beer.

25:13.011 --> 25:15.022
When's she gonna
shit that thing out
anyway?

25:17.017 --> 25:19.001
Uh...

25:19.021 --> 25:22.014
Listen, Dad, um...

25:22.016 --> 25:24.020
Kate and I
have been talking,

25:24.022 --> 25:28.009
and she thinks that--
We think that...

25:28.011 --> 25:33.011
with all the bad blood
between you and Mom,
that...

25:33.013 --> 25:36.006
We don't wanna create
a scene at the wedding,

25:36.008 --> 25:39.001
and we think that...

25:39.003 --> 25:40.008
[sighs]

25:40.010 --> 25:42.012
Well, probably one of you
shouldn't come,

25:42.014 --> 25:46.012
and we think it'll be best
if that was you.

25:47.015 --> 25:49.001
-Uh-huh.
-I mean,

25:49.003 --> 25:51.023
you sort of did fuck
the counter girl at the DQ.

25:52.001 --> 25:54.003
I hear you loud
and clear, Cliffie.

25:55.004 --> 25:56.011
Okay, uh...

25:56.013 --> 25:57.018
All right, let's drink
some beer.

25:58.018 --> 26:00.007
Actually I'm gonna
get going.

26:00.009 --> 26:01.020
All right. Well, uh...

26:01.022 --> 26:02.023
How about a road soda?

26:03.001 --> 26:04.021
Hey, do me a favor.

26:04.023 --> 26:08.021
Or, you know what?
You can consider this
my wedding toast.

26:08.023 --> 26:10.019
Why don't you
respect yourself?

26:10.021 --> 26:12.016
You aren't even
married yet,

26:12.018 --> 26:15.003
and she's already
steering you around
by your short and curlies.

26:15.005 --> 26:16.015
She's having my baby.

26:16.017 --> 26:19.015
Which I know is a big
fucking deal to you, I do.

26:19.017 --> 26:22.009
But let's see what happens
in the next year or two.

26:23.003 --> 26:24.007
What the fuck?

26:26.015 --> 26:29.022
The road is long
and twisty, son.

26:30.000 --> 26:34.000
And in the end,
whoever you are,
or whoever you're with,

26:34.002 --> 26:37.010
all's you got
is your self-respect.
You understand me?

26:37.012 --> 26:38.015
I know where I will be.

26:38.017 --> 26:40.007
I'll be right here.

26:40.009 --> 26:41.008
Okay.

26:41.010 --> 26:44.000
With my wife
and with my baby.

26:44.002 --> 26:46.001
Good luck to you.

26:46.003 --> 26:48.021
You know, you wouldn't know
the first fucking thing
about self-respect.

26:48.023 --> 26:50.003
[engine starts]

26:50.005 --> 26:52.002
Yeah, and one other
piece of advice.

26:52.004 --> 26:55.009
When that baby doctor
asks you if you want
the husband stitch,

26:55.011 --> 26:57.019
you tell him,
"I'll take two."

27:00.002 --> 27:01.019
Hey, get your ass
back here!

27:03.002 --> 27:04.003
Asshole.

27:04.005 --> 27:05.011
[bottle shatters]

27:08.020 --> 27:10.018
[Dorothy] Time to feed
the rats?

27:10.020 --> 27:12.009
-[Cliff] Fuck!
-Sorry!

27:12.011 --> 27:14.010
-Sorry.
-Jesus, kid!

27:14.012 --> 27:16.006
What?

27:16.008 --> 27:18.015
[Dorothy] I...
I was just...

27:18.017 --> 27:20.002
I thought...

27:20.004 --> 27:22.006
if you were going
to feed the rats...

27:23.010 --> 27:26.014
maybe I could go with you.

27:26.016 --> 27:29.023
Which I totally understand
if you thought inappropriate
or a bother.

27:30.001 --> 27:31.015
[Cliff] Well, I do,

27:31.017 --> 27:35.016
and I'm not, so... Bye.

27:36.017 --> 27:37.017
Going for a drive?

27:37.019 --> 27:38.022
[Cliff sighs] What?

27:39.000 --> 27:41.001
I've never rode
in an automobile.

27:41.003 --> 27:42.006
[Cliff] Fuck my life.

27:42.008 --> 27:43.019
This one seems nice.

27:43.021 --> 27:46.002
[Cliff] Kid, you ever

41:31.007 --> 41:32.022
Do you see Mr. Nobody?

41:33.000 --> 41:34.005
[Rita] Yes.

41:34.007 --> 41:35.016
[Vic] No.

41:35.018 --> 41:37.002
This is a trap.

41:38.023 --> 41:40.003
This is a trap.

41:40.005 --> 41:41.010
-Victor...
-This is--

41:41.012 --> 41:43.014
Victor!

41:43.016 --> 41:46.016
Mr. Nobody is still
in the painting.

41:46.018 --> 41:48.007
It's not a trap...

41:48.009 --> 41:49.017
and I'm not going anywhere.

41:49.019 --> 41:51.013
-Do you hear me?
-No, this is a trap.

41:55.006 --> 41:56.009
This is a trap.

41:57.023 --> 41:59.001
Dorothy!

41:59.003 --> 42:00.007
Over there.

42:06.001 --> 42:07.008
[Cliff] Dorothy?

42:07.010 --> 42:09.004
Hey, kid. You okay?

42:09.023 --> 42:10.023
Dorothy?

42:11.001 --> 42:12.001
[rats squeaking]

42:12.003 --> 42:13.014
[Cliff] The fuck?

42:13.016 --> 42:14.020
[rats squeaking]

42:18.010 --> 42:19.020
She's a mommy.

42:23.015 --> 42:24.019
[Cliff] Whoa!

42:25.013 --> 42:26.022
There are so many.

42:28.004 --> 42:31.007
[Dorothy] Aw!
What's wrong with
that one?

42:32.017 --> 42:34.000
So small.

42:35.005 --> 42:36.019
What if she doesn't see it?

42:36.021 --> 42:39.003
[Cliff] It's okay.
See? Look.

42:39.005 --> 42:41.015
Mommy rat's picking
it up, and...

42:41.017 --> 42:42.022
[rat screeching]

42:43.000 --> 42:45.004
Oh! Ooh, shit!

42:45.006 --> 42:46.013
[Dorothy]
What's happening?

42:46.015 --> 42:48.012
-[Cliff] Uh...
-What's happening?

42:49.008 --> 42:50.019
Natural order.

42:50.021 --> 42:52.010
-[bones crunching]
-[Dorothy shrieks]

42:52.012 --> 42:55.005
The weakest one is a liability,
so it has to go.

42:55.007 --> 42:56.012
[Dorothy sobbing]

42:56.014 --> 42:58.015
It killed the baby!

43:00.008 --> 43:02.004
[screaming]

43:02.006 --> 43:03.014
[Cliff] Uh, it's okay!
It's okay!

43:03.016 --> 43:04.021
Jane, a little help?

43:04.023 --> 43:06.009
Jane? Jane!

43:06.011 --> 43:08.023
-[Dorothy continues screaming]
-[Cliff] Oh, what the...

43:09.001 --> 43:10.009
[Cliff]
It's okay. It's okay.

43:10.011 --> 43:12.010
Everything is
gonna be okay.

43:12.012 --> 43:14.000
Just fine.

43:14.002 --> 43:15.021
Everything is
gonna be okay.

43:15.023 --> 43:17.002
It's okay. It's okay.

43:17.004 --> 43:18.011
[Niles] Dorothy!

43:18.013 --> 43:19.018
[Cliff] Chief!

43:24.009 --> 43:25.015
What the hell
is going on?

43:25.017 --> 43:26.021
[Cliff] She was just...

43:26.023 --> 43:28.023
This... This rat was, uh...
Babies...

43:29.001 --> 43:31.012
And then, out of nowhere
she just... chop!

43:31.014 --> 43:32.022
I mean, fuck!

43:33.000 --> 43:34.011
[creature growling]

43:35.010 --> 43:37.015
[footsteps thumping]

43:37.017 --> 43:39.007
[creature roars]

43:40.003 --> 43:41.006
No.

43:42.008 --> 43:44.019
Dorothy, listen to me.

43:44.021 --> 43:46.023
Everything is all right.

43:47.001 --> 43:49.003
[shivering] It's not.
It's not.

43:49.005 --> 43:50.018
Please, my love.

43:51.010 --> 43:52.021
Just breathe.

43:52.023 --> 43:54.007
[creature growls softly]

43:55.006 --> 43:56.011
Cliff, don't!

43:56.013 --> 43:59.004
This isn't something
you can just punch.

44:00.018 --> 44:02.014
[creature growls softly]

44:04.001 --> 44:06.018
[Cliff] Hey! Hey, you!

44:06.020 --> 44:08.015
[metal squeaking]

44:08.017 --> 44:10.000
Whoa!

44:13.023 --> 44:15.005
Fuck!

44:15.007 --> 44:17.019
Dorothy, my darling.
I know you're scared.

44:17.021 --> 44:20.001
But you must breathe.

44:20.003 --> 44:21.016
Listen to my voice.

44:21.018 --> 44:23.002
I can't.

44:23.004 --> 44:24.015
-[Cliff] Okay, you wanna go?
-[footsteps thumping]

44:24.017 --> 44:25.018
Let's go!

44:30.017 --> 44:32.007
What the fuck!

44:35.001 --> 44:38.020
Hey, whatever you're
doing to Dorothy,
you better fucking stop!

44:41.009 --> 44:43.005
Okay, weird thing
with the face again.

44:43.007 --> 44:45.018
You wanna dance, too?
Let's do this.

44:45.020 --> 44:47.007
[Niles] Dorothy...

44:47.009 --> 44:50.005
-[creature] <i>Help... girl...</i>
-[Dorothy shudders]

44:50.007 --> 44:53.010
Leave... me... alone!

44:54.014 --> 44:56.004
[loud thudding]

44:56.006 --> 44:58.003
[Cliff] How many imaginary
friends do you have
in there?

44:58.005 --> 44:59.009
Jesus Christ!

44:59.011 --> 45:01.002
-[metallic crash]
-[Cliff screams]

45:01.004 --> 45:04.014
[creature] <i>Make stop.</i>

45:04.016 --> 45:05.023
[Dorothy] He's coming.

45:06.001 --> 45:08.007
-[low growl]
-He's coming!

45:08.009 --> 45:10.012
He won't stop,
he's coming.

45:10.014 --> 45:11.015
You have to!

45:11.017 --> 45:14.002
[creature] <i>Make wish.</i>

45:14.004 --> 45:15.010
[Dorothy] He wants me
to make a wish.

45:15.012 --> 45:16.018
You must keep him back.

45:16.020 --> 45:18.023
-I can't!
-You must!

45:19.001 --> 45:21.009
[creature]
<i>Make wish.</i>

45:22.014 --> 45:25.003
You have to send him back,
you have to!

45:25.005 --> 45:27.004
Don't make me
lock you away again!

45:27.006 --> 45:28.015
[Dorothy gasps]

45:30.008 --> 45:32.005
[roaring stops]

45:36.014 --> 45:38.002
[Dorothy sobbing]

46:17.004 --> 46:18.023
[loud crashing]

46:35.019 --> 46:36.023
[sighs]

46:38.018 --> 46:41.003
[Kipling] I can scarcely
believe it, Caulder.

46:42.022 --> 46:46.010
Cut-throat, scheming,
selfish lone wolf...

46:47.021 --> 46:50.021
giving everything up
for his feckless freaks.

46:50.023 --> 46:53.013
Dorothy needs to
be kept safe.

46:53.015 --> 46:56.015
Away from any situation
that might foster...

46:56.017 --> 46:58.015
Unpleasantness.

46:58.017 --> 47:00.004
And as for the others...

47:02.001 --> 47:03.012
They've suffered enough.

47:05.003 --> 47:07.015
I have to try
and make it right...

47:07.017 --> 47:09.013
in whatever small
way I can.

47:09.015 --> 47:10.020
"Small"?

47:12.007 --> 47:14.004
It's hardly what I call
giving up your life.

47:33.000 --> 47:34.019
<i>Vitae essentia.</i>

47:36.003 --> 47:38.014
No take-backs on
a fool's bargain, Niles.

47:39.015 --> 47:41.010
Only a fool...

47:41.012 --> 47:44.001
would consider himself
before his family.

47:45.008 --> 47:48.005
What lies before me now
is simply...

47:48.007 --> 47:50.000
a riddle I have not yet solved.

47:50.002 --> 47:52.015
[Kipling] Well, you better
solve it quick, old man.

48:11.021 --> 48:13.003
Eat up.

48:13.005 --> 48:14.022
Lot of new mouths to feed.

48:24.001 --> 48:25.002
Ha!

48:29.010 --> 48:30.011
Ha!

48:40.021 --> 48:42.007
[yells]

48:48.016 --> 48:49.019
Vic!

48:49.021 --> 48:51.012
You won't believe it!

49:36.021 --> 49:38.009
Fuck you.

49:38.011 --> 49:39.013
[zipper unzips]

49:40.017 --> 49:42.009
[sighs, sniffles]

50:09.007 --> 50:11.000
[sighs heavily]

50:11.002 --> 50:13.009
[Niles and Dorothy]
<i>Tonight another day</i>
<i>has passed,</i>

50:14.004 --> 50:16.021
and no matter noise,

50:16.023 --> 50:19.009
no matter dark,

50:19.011 --> 50:23.011
we must sit,
and stay,
and wait.

50:24.020 --> 50:26.015
[both whisper]
Or be quiet,

50:26.017 --> 50:29.008
and be polite,

50:29.010 --> 50:32.004
till tomorrow's at the gate.

50:35.018 --> 50:38.001
[sighs]
Good night, my love.

50:41.018 --> 50:43.017
[both chuckle]

50:45.009 --> 50:46.012
[Dorothy sighs]

50:51.020 --> 50:53.010
-Papa?
-Hmm?

50:55.022 --> 50:57.021
You will always
be with me...

50:59.013 --> 51:00.014
won't you?

51:02.007 --> 51:03.023
I'm not going anywhere.

51:12.017 --> 51:14.002
Dream well.

51:26.003 --> 51:27.017
Night-night, Herschel.

51:29.011 --> 51:31.001
You too, Darling.

51:32.013 --> 51:33.015
[giggles]

51:36.009 --> 51:37.016
I love you, too.

51:39.012 --> 51:40.022
Sleep tight.

51:49.019 --> 51:51.003
[creature] <i>Father...</i>

51:52.010 --> 51:53.015
<i>dying.</i>

52:00.019 --> 52:02.020
It's time for bed.

52:04.009 --> 52:06.011
We have to go to sleep.

52:07.003 --> 52:08.015
All of us.

52:09.014 --> 52:11.021
<i>Must... stop.</i>

52:11.023 --> 52:14.007
He's not dying!

52:16.016 --> 52:18.006
You heard him.

52:22.012 --> 52:24.003
He's not going anywhere.

52:24.023 --> 52:27.015
<i>Make... wish.</i>

52:27.017 --> 52:28.022
No!

52:33.015 --> 52:34.018
[sighs]

52:34.020 --> 52:36.008
Not today.

52:42.010 --> 52:43.021
<i>When?</i>

52:46.023 --> 52:48.008
We'll see.
