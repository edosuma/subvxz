He rode on it later,

17:53.020 --> 17:54.170

the one who stole it.

17:54.170 --> 17:56.180

17:56.180 --> 17:58.220

18:08.060 --> 18:11.050

20:36.160 --> 20:38.180
- She says the other kid
stole it and he was innocent.

20:41.080 --> 20:42.120
- Where is she?

20:42.120 --> 20:44.070
[knocking on door]

20:44.070 --> 20:46.070
- Hey.
- Hey.

20:46.070 --> 20:48.230
- You all set?
Wow, looks like it.

20:48.230 --> 20:50.050
- Yeah, I'm ready.

20:52.110 --> 20:54.020
- Listen,

20:54.020 --> 20:56.060
if the DA is willing
to continue with no finding,

20:56.060 --> 20:57.160
you can't say no.

20:57.160 --> 20:59.100
- But he didn't steal this bike.

20:59.100 --> 21:00.200
- Rebecca.
- The problem is,

21:00.200 --> 21:01.220
I don't believe
he won't steal another.

21:01.220 --> 21:03.150
And if he does steal another,

21:03.150 --> 21:05.070
the DA's offer
becomes worthless.

21:05.070 --> 21:07.020
Because when you admit
to sufficient facts,

21:07.020 --> 21:09.090
the judge can enter
a guilty finding retroactively

21:09.090 --> 21:10.170
if he's caught committing
another crime.

21:10.170 --> 21:12.060
- All true.

21:12.060 --> 21:13.150
But you're not dealing
with the next crime.

21:13.150 --> 21:14.230
You're not his mother,
Rebecca.

21:14.230 --> 21:16.230
You're his lawyer for this case.

21:16.230 --> 21:21.130
And on this case, turning down
the offer is unthinkable.

21:21.130 --> 21:25.110
- I think about the kid,
not just the case at hand.

21:25.110 --> 21:27.020
- All right,
then think about the kid.

21:27.020 --> 21:30.030
You say he'll probably
steal another bike.

21:30.030 --> 21:31.110
You get him a not guilty here,

21:31.110 --> 21:33.210
probably steal it
sooner than later.

21:33.210 --> 21:35.080
You take
the no finding deal,

21:35.080 --> 21:37.020
and this case stays hanging
over his head.

21:37.020 --> 21:39.040
That's a bigger incentive
for him to behave.

21:42.210 --> 21:45.130
Take the offer, Rebecca.

21:45.130 --> 21:46.180
- Is that the way
this goes, Bobby?

21:46.180 --> 21:48.170
You order me which way to go?

21:48.170 --> 21:50.030
- It's strong advice.

21:50.030 --> 21:52.090
- And I'll consider it.

21:56.020 --> 21:57.140
- Jimmy's going with you.

21:57.140 --> 22:00.140
- Bobby, it's my case.
- Your first case.

22:00.140 --> 22:03.100
Jimmy's going with you,
and that is an order.

22:03.100 --> 22:06.080
[door opens, closes]

22:12.030 --> 22:13.090
- Great, thanks.

22:13.090 --> 22:14.160
The case went to Judge Hiller.

22:16.130 --> 22:18.010
- Excellent.

22:18.010 --> 22:19.010
Maybe.

22:19.010 --> 22:20.180
- Why maybe?

22:20.180 --> 22:24.010
- She's a friend,
but she's also by the book.

22:24.010 --> 22:25.080
10:00?
- You should go.

22:25.080 --> 22:26.160
Jimmy's research.

22:26.160 --> 22:27.210
I highlighted anything
first circuit.

22:27.210 --> 22:29.190
- Mm, good.

22:29.190 --> 22:31.050
You all set?

22:31.050 --> 22:32.230
- Set.

22:34.070 --> 22:35.130
- Rebecca?

22:38.110 --> 22:40.020
Good luck.

22:40.020 --> 22:41.150
- Thank you.

22:41.150 --> 22:44.020
- Go get 'em, Beck.
- You'll be great.

22:44.020 --> 22:45.060
- No biting.

22:45.060 --> 22:46.100
- I...

22:46.100 --> 22:47.100
- Good luck.

22:47.100 --> 22:49.230
- Thank you.

22:49.230 --> 22:52.080
- Jimmy?
- I'm there.

22:54.110 --> 22:56.060
[door slams]

22:56.060 --> 22:58.080
- I wouldn't be arguing
self-defense.

22:58.080 --> 23:01.050
- The guy was a wacko.
- Unarmed wacko.

23:01.050 --> 23:03.020
BOBBY: The victim was basically
stalking him, Your Honor.

23:03.020 --> 23:06.010
He showed up everywhere,
calling my client "Mercedes."

23:06.010 --> 23:08.010
"Hey, Mercedes.
How you doing, Mercedes?"

23:08.010 --> 23:09.150
- Why'd he call him that?

23:09.150 --> 23:11.010
- Because that's the car
my client was driving

23:11.010 --> 23:12.130
when they got into
the initial dispute.

23:12.130 --> 23:14.140
- You mean this started
with a traffic incident?

23:14.140 --> 23:16.110
- And the threats
started to escalate,

23:16.110 --> 23:18.020
and he vandalized
their property,

23:18.020 --> 23:20.150
and he killed their cat.

23:20.150 --> 23:23.150
- Well, you can't use excessive
force to protect a pet.

23:23.150 --> 23:25.090
- What I'm saying is
the threats started getting

23:25.090 --> 23:27.070
more and more dangerous.

23:27.070 --> 23:28.100
- I understand,

23:28.100 --> 23:30.010
and it may have reached a point

23:30.010 --> 23:32.000
where he was even
about to kill them.

23:32.000 --> 23:35.060
But we weren't at that point
when your client shot him.

23:35.060 --> 23:36.170
- Well, I think
that's a question of fact

23:36.170 --> 23:38.180
left for the jury.

23:38.180 --> 23:41.030
- The jury's not going
to get that question, Bobby.

23:42.140 --> 23:44.080
- Why not?

23:44.080 --> 23:46.190
- Because if they're offered
self-defense,

23:46.190 --> 23:49.150
we all know
they're going to jump at it.

23:49.150 --> 23:52.210
The defendant is
a well-respected family man.

23:52.210 --> 23:55.200
The victim is a crazy loon.

23:55.200 --> 23:57.190
The jury
would look for any excuse

23:57.190 --> 23:59.050
to set your guy free.

23:59.050 --> 24:00.220
That's not going to happen.

24:00.220 --> 24:02.140
- You can't limit our defense
to what you think--

24:02.140 --> 24:05.100
- I can refuse an instruction,

24:05.100 --> 24:07.040
Ms. Dole.

24:07.040 --> 24:09.020
And if you get a bad jury
instruction

24:09.020 --> 24:10.160
on top of this set of facts,

24:10.160 --> 24:12.220
we all know where your client
will be heading.

24:16.120 --> 24:19.030
I'm doing you a favor here.

24:19.030 --> 24:20.180
Trust me.

24:20.180 --> 24:23.160
You don't want to
be arguing self-defense.

24:26.050 --> 24:27.150
- Technically,
she can't block us.

24:27.150 --> 24:28.220
- Well, without a good jury
instruction,

24:28.220 --> 24:30.030
we've got
to go back to insanity.

24:38.220 --> 24:40.060
We'd better go tell him.

24:44.200 --> 24:46.140
- Just give me an idea.

24:46.140 --> 24:48.170
I've got to tell the child's
mother something.

24:48.170 --> 24:50.130
- Of course
I have to cross-examine him.

24:50.130 --> 24:52.160
- That's not what I mean,
and you know it.

24:52.160 --> 24:54.090
- Look, my guy
may be a murderer,

24:54.090 --> 24:56.000
but he's still entitled
to the best defense possible.

24:56.000 --> 24:57.070
That's our glorious system.

24:57.070 --> 24:58.210
- Kent.

24:58.210 --> 25:00.030
- If you had any other evidence,
that would be one thing,

25:00.030 --> 25:01.110
but I've got no choice here.

25:03.130 --> 25:05.020
- No choice but to what?

25:07.140 --> 25:11.070
- You have to understand,
a probable cause hearing,

25:11.070 --> 25:13.060
as far as the defense
is concerned,

25:13.060 --> 25:15.070
can be used as discovery.

25:15.070 --> 25:17.060
- So he's just going
to pick away at Danny

25:17.060 --> 25:18.100
in a witness chair?

25:18.100 --> 25:19.210
- Well, if there were any--

25:19.210 --> 25:21.180
- My son is in terrible shape,
Ms. Gamble.

25:21.180 --> 25:24.200
He just saw a man
bludgeon a young woman to death,

25:24.200 --> 25:27.060
a woman he was very attached to.

25:27.060 --> 25:28.140
- I know.

25:28.140 --> 25:32.010
- And now,
can't these questions,

25:32.010 --> 25:33.090
can't we do it
in a room,

25:33.090 --> 25:35.010
or even back at our house?

25:35.010 --> 25:37.090
Does he have to go
into a big courtroom?

25:37.090 --> 25:41.060
- Well, I'm afraid
that's part of the whole idea.

25:41.060 --> 25:43.050
- What idea?

25:43.050 --> 25:44.120
- Mrs. Walsh, please.

25:48.110 --> 25:51.170
See, part of the plan

25:51.170 --> 25:54.210
for the defense attorney
will be to shake your son.

25:54.210 --> 25:56.140
I don't mean to shake his story,

25:56.140 --> 25:59.070
but shake him.

25:59.070 --> 26:02.180
He wants this to be an awful
experience for you.

26:02.180 --> 26:05.020
He wants you to be
so repulsed tomorrow

26:05.020 --> 26:06.180
that you'd sooner
leave the country than

26:06.180 --> 26:10.070
let your son
go through it again at trial.

26:10.070 --> 26:13.040
- What's he gonna do?
- Whatever he can.

26:13.040 --> 26:14.100
I know this lawyer.

26:14.100 --> 26:16.030
He's a pretty good guy.

26:16.030 --> 26:20.070
But his duty tomorrow
won't be to look out for Danny.

26:22.070 --> 26:24.050
- This is barbaric.

26:26.070 --> 26:28.070
- Sometimes it is.

26:31.230 --> 26:35.150
- We saw them clipping the lock,
laughing.

26:35.150 --> 26:38.100
And then they took it
and rode away.

26:38.100 --> 26:41.180
- And you're sure the defendant
was one of those boys?

26:41.180 --> 26:43.080
- Oh, yes.

26:43.080 --> 26:46.030
- Thank you, Ms. Jolly.

26:46.030 --> 26:49.110
- Was it this boy that
actually clipped the lock,

26:49.110 --> 26:51.020
or was it the other boy?

26:51.020 --> 26:52.230
- I believe it was
the other one.

26:52.230 --> 26:56.230
- And was it this boy
that rode away on the bike,

26:56.230 --> 26:58.190
or was it be other one?

26:58.190 --> 26:59.230
- The other one,

26:59.230 --> 27:01.210
but he ran alongside.

27:03.230 --> 27:07.100
- Officer, you say you caught
my client on the bike.

27:07.100 --> 27:09.060
It's that why you arrested him?

27:09.060 --> 27:10.060
- Yes, ma'am.

27:10.060 --> 27:12.000
The bicycle was stolen.

27:12.000 --> 27:14.010
We caught your client
while he was riding it.

27:14.010 --> 27:17.010
- And you never
saw him before this?

27:17.010 --> 27:18.170
- That's correct.

27:18.170 --> 27:24.080
- Never saw him while
the bicycle was being stolen?

27:24.080 --> 27:25.200
- That's correct.

27:28.230 --> 27:30.180
- I think it went okay.
- Oh, it did.

27:30.180 --> 27:32.190
So good, you should rest.

27:32.190 --> 27:34.040
- What, and not put
Michael up there?

27:34.040 --> 27:35.140
- I don't think
they made the elements,

27:35.140 --> 27:37.010
and Michael could blow it.

27:37.010 --> 27:38.120
- Yeah, but if he doesn't
tell his side--

27:38.120 --> 27:40.130
- Beck, when you first
interviewed the kid,

27:40.130 --> 27:41.140
you didn't believe him.

27:41.140 --> 27:43.020
- Yeah, I know,

27:43.020 --> 27:45.070
but he was there
at the scene laughing.

27:45.070 --> 27:47.100
I mean, he was caught
riding the thing.

27:47.100 --> 27:48.160
I think he has
to account for that

27:48.160 --> 27:51.130
for us to have a chance.

27:51.130 --> 27:52.190
- You could go either way.

27:52.190 --> 27:54.170
It's a close call.

27:54.170 --> 27:57.100
- I'm gonna put him up there.

27:57.100 --> 27:58.120
- You been
over his testimony?

27:58.120 --> 28:00.210
- Oh, at least 20 times.

28:00.210 --> 28:02.130
- What about
an interlocutory appeal?

28:02.130 --> 28:04.090
- She's not officially
blocking self-defense.

28:04.090 --> 28:07.030
She's just nudging us
for our own good.

28:07.030 --> 28:09.110
- I think it's back
to temporary insanity,

28:09.110 --> 28:10.190
which means
you've got to count the ways

28:10.190 --> 28:12.120
you loved that cat.

28:12.120 --> 28:15.170
I'm sorry,
but we are in a hole here.

28:15.170 --> 28:17.190
You pulled that trigger
five times.

28:17.190 --> 28:20.070
You bought the gun specifically
because of this guy.

28:20.070 --> 28:22.230
Your threat
to kill him is on record.

28:22.230 --> 28:24.230
I still think
the jury will sympathize, but...

28:24.230 --> 28:27.180
- I...

28:27.180 --> 28:30.160
I didn't go to the door
to kill him.

28:30.160 --> 28:32.110
It just...

28:32.110 --> 28:34.050
A gun.

28:34.050 --> 28:37.050
You can kill with just a twitch.

28:48.030 --> 28:50.220
- I'm not saying
I tried to stop him.

28:50.220 --> 28:53.070
I didn't.

28:53.070 --> 28:55.080
And I did ride it.

28:55.080 --> 28:57.210
But I didn't steal it.

28:57.210 --> 29:01.170
- Michael, did you
encourage your friend Jimmy

29:01.170 --> 29:03.000
to steal it?

29:03.000 --> 29:04.050
- No.

29:04.050 --> 29:05.180
Maybe I should have stopped him,

29:05.180 --> 29:08.050
but I wouldn't steal
anyone's bike.

29:08.050 --> 29:09.140
I don't steal.

29:09.140 --> 29:12.000
My mom,
she raised me to be honest.

29:12.000 --> 29:15.040
- Do you think
you behaved honestly here?

29:15.040 --> 29:16.190
- Not totally.

29:16.190 --> 29:19.060
I just kind of went along.

29:19.060 --> 29:21.200
But it was Jimmy who did it.

29:21.200 --> 29:25.050
- You just kind of
went along with it?

29:25.050 --> 29:26.210
- Yes.

MICHAEL: Yeah.

- Objection!
- Overruled.

- Didn't you steal a bike
two years ago, Michael?

29:36.150 --> 29:38.090
- I was never prosecuted for it.

29:38.090 --> 29:40.120
- Have you ever been caught
cheating in school, Michael?

29:40.120 --> 29:41.210
- Objection!

She can't talk

29:50.030 --> 29:52.120

but the witness opened the door.

29:52.120 --> 29:54.000
He introduced his honesty.

29:54.000 --> 29:56.080
