00:01.235 --> 00:03.404
You're witnessing
the power of Empire.

00:03.437 --> 00:05.906
I'm Cookie Lyon, baby.
I'm unforgettable.

00:05.939 --> 00:07.675
Catch all-new episodes
Wednesdays.

00:07.708 --> 00:09.210
And check out
our other Fox programs--

00:09.243 --> 00:12.012
Star, The Gifted,
and Lethal Weapon.

00:12.046 --> 00:14.548
That was the best idea
you've had all day.

00:14.582 --> 00:15.749
Only on Fox.

00:17.017 --> 00:20.221
-Previously on Empire...
-You had a mild heart attack.

00:20.254 --> 00:22.990
Mom heard what happened.
She wants to see you.

00:23.023 --> 00:25.193
Poundcake, I will find
your baby girl,

00:25.226 --> 00:27.661
-and I will bring her here.
-You let Eddie into Empire,

00:27.695 --> 00:29.530
and he's about to steal it
from under you.

00:29.563 --> 00:30.831
Eddie saw something in me,

00:30.864 --> 00:32.600
and he promised that
if I just stay focused,

00:32.633 --> 00:34.368
that he'd get me here.

00:34.402 --> 00:37.771
We've been testing some
of our 20 For 20 releases,

00:37.805 --> 00:40.574
and it's not what your fans
expect or want from you.

00:40.608 --> 00:44.044
I want to be your partner,
in business and in life.

00:50.918 --> 00:53.087
-Good morning, beautiful.
-Oh, good morning. What is this?

00:53.121 --> 00:54.922
A little breakfast for my love.

00:54.955 --> 00:56.457
COOKIE (yawns):
That's good. Yeah.

00:56.490 --> 00:58.592
Excusez-moi. Pardonne-moi.

00:58.626 --> 01:00.361
Are you almost ready
to go, boss?

01:00.394 --> 01:02.029
(sighs)

01:02.062 --> 01:04.998
-Yeah, I got to grab something.
-Okay.

01:06.734 --> 01:08.169
(coughs)

01:09.770 --> 01:12.306
What's up with Poundcake's
daughter? You found anything?

01:12.340 --> 01:14.475
Oh, her name is Maya. She's 19.

01:14.508 --> 01:16.877
She got adopted by some
white people living upstate.

01:16.910 --> 01:19.447
And she's, uh, currently
studying at NYU.

01:19.480 --> 01:22.316
-Classical ballet.
-Are you sure you got
the right girl?

01:22.350 --> 01:24.318
Are you really doubting my
investigating skills? Really?

01:24.352 --> 01:26.320
I mean, I can send someone
around if you want...

01:26.354 --> 01:27.888
No. I'm gonna go myself.

01:27.921 --> 01:29.590
Keep your lips zipped,
do not tell him,

01:29.623 --> 01:31.125
'cause I don't want him
worried about me.

01:31.159 --> 01:32.660
So, what, you're just gonna
roll up on her?

01:32.693 --> 01:34.662
That's a big bomb to drop, mama.
Not everyone likes surprises.

01:34.695 --> 01:36.897
Poundcake is dying. Okay?

01:36.930 --> 01:39.733
I don't have time to tiptoe
around this ballerina.

01:39.767 --> 01:42.136
Hey. What are you doing
next to my wife's bed?

01:42.170 --> 01:43.937
-Come on, boss, I was just
checking out the duvet. -Duvet.

01:43.971 --> 01:46.640
Rest.

01:46.674 --> 01:48.842
Why you walking all through
my house like that, man?

01:48.876 --> 01:50.311
I'm looking for
the bathroom, man.

01:50.344 --> 01:51.945
You got 15 rooms here. My bad.

01:51.979 --> 01:54.748
I was just, you know,
looking to get us going.

01:54.782 --> 01:56.484
What we need to be doing
is looking for a way

01:56.517 --> 01:58.018
to get Eddie Barker
up out of there.

01:58.051 --> 02:00.354
I mean, I don't care whether
he's bleeding or screaming,

02:00.388 --> 02:03.023
-I want him out.
-We don't want to
tell Cookie about...

02:03.056 --> 02:04.192
No. It ain't none
of her business.

02:04.225 --> 02:05.959
I'm taking care of this.

02:05.993 --> 02:09.096
I don't want her heart getting
all messed up from it.

02:09.129 --> 02:11.465
You got it, boss.

02:14.635 --> 02:16.370
Your standard exit papers,
Mr. Big Shot.

02:16.404 --> 02:20.974
Sign on pages two and six
and initial page four.

02:22.142 --> 02:24.645
-Then go away.
-What's this all about?

02:24.678 --> 02:27.448
This is about your betrayal,
Eddie.

02:27.481 --> 02:30.451
I mean, if you needed money, why
didn't you just come and ask?

02:30.484 --> 02:34.788
With all due respect, Lu,
what I lost, you don't have.

02:34.822 --> 02:36.957
But the Patel deal would've made
both of us rich.

02:36.990 --> 02:40.127
If you let me move forward
with that, we could fix this.

02:40.160 --> 02:42.330
Listen, the only reason that
I'm letting you walk out of here

02:42.363 --> 02:44.832
on two legs is because
we've got history.

02:44.865 --> 02:46.500
And if I don't sign these?

02:48.602 --> 02:52.306
Well, then, I'll have
a conversation with the SEC

02:52.340 --> 02:54.007
about your insider trading scam.

02:54.041 --> 02:56.710
My insider trading scam?

02:56.744 --> 02:58.846
No, brother, come on.

02:58.879 --> 03:02.182
My ex-wives invested in Empire
on their own.

03:02.216 --> 03:04.718
And nobody,
nobody is gonna believe

03:04.752 --> 03:06.654
that I can control those women.

03:06.687 --> 03:08.856
I'd love to sit and chat,

03:08.889 --> 03:12.893
but I have a dinner with my
favorite board member, Edna.

03:15.195 --> 03:18.031
(whispers):
She has a little thing for me.

03:18.065 --> 03:20.834
I hope, uh, you enjoy
the offices while you still can.

03:20.868 --> 03:23.904
Got to find me one like this.

03:26.874 --> 03:29.843
THIRSTY:
He's a smug one, ain't he?

03:29.877 --> 03:32.713
Guess we got to handle this
a different way, huh, boss?

03:32.746 --> 03:34.748
*

03:39.720 --> 03:42.390
(thumping)

03:42.423 --> 03:46.527
Eddie Barker is an infidel
inside of our temple.

03:46.560 --> 03:48.562
Dad, but this is Uncle Eddie,
man. That's crazy.

03:48.596 --> 03:50.063
No, it ain't.
He brainwashed Tiana.

03:50.097 --> 03:51.799
That's why she turned down
my proposal.

03:51.832 --> 03:53.734
Yeah, man, that's why
she turned you down.

03:53.767 --> 03:55.936
Look, this chubalump
used shell companies

03:55.969 --> 03:57.705
to gobble up Empire stock,
then he tried

03:57.738 --> 03:59.407
to sell Empire right
from underneath your parents.

03:59.440 --> 04:01.709
-Okay, but why would he do that?
-LUCIOUS: Because he lost

04:01.742 --> 04:03.711
all of his money,
then he lost his mind,

04:03.744 --> 04:05.746
and now it's time that he loses
his position here.

04:05.779 --> 04:07.748
-What's the plan?
-Well, the plan

04:07.781 --> 04:10.083
is to get him out
as quietly as possible

04:10.117 --> 04:12.252
without creating a ruckus
with the board.

04:12.286 --> 04:13.787
Don't tell your mama about this.

04:13.821 --> 04:15.323
-She's resting.
-(phone vibrates)

04:15.356 --> 04:19.026
Lucious, we got to get
to Laviticus. Something's up.

04:21.295 --> 04:23.163
(classical music playing)

04:27.134 --> 04:29.937
DIRECTOR:
Jeté. Temps levé.

04:29.970 --> 04:31.472
-(clapping)
-No, Ana.

04:31.505 --> 04:33.674
-(music stops)
-Please step aside. Maya.

04:39.112 --> 04:41.382
Come. Show her what I mean.

04:45.218 --> 04:48.255
Five, six, seven, eight, and...

04:48.288 --> 04:50.391
(classical music playing)

05:02.336 --> 05:03.504
Okay, okay.

05:04.905 --> 05:07.775
Maya, your birth mother
really wants to meet you,

05:07.808 --> 05:09.777
and her name is Poundcake.

05:09.810 --> 05:11.945
(sighs) Poundcake.

05:11.979 --> 05:13.280
(clears throat)

05:13.313 --> 05:15.416
I was her cellmate.

05:18.486 --> 05:21.054
(tempo increases)

05:28.028 --> 05:30.898
-(door buzzes)
-(kids chattering playfully)

05:30.931 --> 05:33.066
CAROL:
So how's it going in here, Cook?

05:33.100 --> 05:35.369
-COOKIE: Good.
-I have a surprise for you

05:35.403 --> 05:37.738
and I don't want you
to blow a gasket, okay?

05:37.771 --> 05:38.906
Okay.

05:38.939 --> 05:40.641
How are you?

05:40.674 --> 05:42.710
Mama reached out.

05:46.447 --> 05:47.848
What?

05:47.881 --> 05:50.150
We talked to her,
me and Candace.

05:50.183 --> 05:52.319
What the hell for?

05:52.352 --> 05:53.821
She's our mom.

05:53.854 --> 05:56.824
Oh. (chuckles) No.
She lost that right

05:56.857 --> 05:59.493
when she cheated on Daddy
and walked out on us.

05:59.527 --> 06:01.194
We were babies.

06:01.228 --> 06:03.330
No, no.
That is not how it happened.

06:03.363 --> 06:05.866
He threatened to kill her.
You know that, right?

06:05.899 --> 06:07.668
And told her that
she could not even come back

06:07.701 --> 06:10.538
-or reach out to us.
-She's lying. She's lying.

06:10.571 --> 06:12.873
And Daddy is rolling over
in his grave

06:12.906 --> 06:15.042
'cause you two simple bitches
believed it.

06:15.075 --> 06:17.845
Y'all fell for that?
Get out of here.

06:17.878 --> 06:20.914
Well, she heard you was locked
up, and she wants to see you.

06:20.948 --> 06:22.616
Eh, not gonna happen.

06:22.650 --> 06:25.118
Well, Mama's here.

06:26.587 --> 06:28.889
C.O.? I'm ready to go.

06:28.922 --> 06:30.558
-GUARD: Requesting escort.
-RENEE: Loretha.

06:32.426 --> 06:34.862
Loretha.

06:34.895 --> 06:36.930
Hey.

06:49.109 --> 06:51.945
Hello.

06:51.979 --> 06:53.647
You were really good up there.

06:53.681 --> 06:55.949
The best one.
You should be the lead.

06:55.983 --> 06:57.585
Why aren't you?

06:57.618 --> 06:59.219
Uh, my instructor said
they'd have to

06:59.252 --> 07:01.054
redo the lighting
for my skin tone,

07:01.088 --> 07:03.056
and that doesn't work
for the other girls, so...

07:03.090 --> 07:04.792
Let me tell you something,
sweetheart.

07:04.825 --> 07:06.393
It takes a whole lot of light

07:06.426 --> 07:08.962
to make cheap glass shine
like a diamond.

07:08.996 --> 07:11.398
You're already a diamond, sis,
no matter the light.

07:11.431 --> 07:13.767
Don't you ever forget that.

07:13.801 --> 07:15.168
Oh. (laughs)

07:15.202 --> 07:17.571
I'm Cookie Lyon.

07:17.605 --> 07:20.007
Oh, my God. Right.

07:20.040 --> 07:21.909
(chuckles) From Empire.

07:21.942 --> 07:24.177
Oh, my God.
You manage Tiana, right?

07:24.211 --> 07:26.346
-Among others. (chuckles)
-How crazy.

07:26.379 --> 07:28.248
Uh, what-what are you
doing here?

07:28.281 --> 07:30.684
I came to see you.

07:30.718 --> 07:34.187
Uh, me? Why-why me?

07:36.824 --> 07:38.792
Well, someone like you.

07:38.826 --> 07:41.862
Uh, we're holding auditions
for dancers.

07:41.895 --> 07:44.965
Uh, for Tiana's video.
For her latest single.

07:44.998 --> 07:48.602
Oh, my God.

07:48.636 --> 07:52.005
-Wh... You want me...?
-Mm-hmm.

07:52.039 --> 07:53.541
Oh, my God.

07:53.574 --> 07:55.776
-That would be so amazing.
-It would be amazing

07:55.809 --> 07:58.111
if you could say more
than "Oh, my God."

07:58.145 --> 08:00.180
-(both laugh)
-Sorry.

08:00.213 --> 08:02.215
Don't worry about it,
sweetheart.

08:02.249 --> 08:05.653
Just be at Empire tomorrow,
2:00 p.m.

08:10.724 --> 08:12.826
(breathless):
Oh, my God.

08:12.860 --> 08:14.394
Oh, my God.

08:15.729 --> 08:17.831
Did I tell you
you look beautiful tonight?

08:17.865 --> 08:19.533
No. Thank you.

08:19.567 --> 08:21.569
*

08:27.440 --> 08:29.977
Lucious. Lyon boys.

08:30.010 --> 08:32.312
THIRSTY: Excuse me. Excuse me.
Excuse me a second.

08:32.345 --> 08:33.847
Excuse me. Watch yourself.

08:33.881 --> 08:37.217
Why wasn't Mr. Lyon invited
to wh-whatever this is?

08:37.250 --> 08:38.251
-Oh, wait a second. I'm sorry.
-(phone vibrates)

08:38.285 --> 08:39.319
-Oh.
-There's a...

08:39.352 --> 08:41.154
-Tiana's here. Everybody!
-(groans)

08:41.188 --> 08:43.423
-Everybody. Shh. Tiana's here.
-(crowd quiets)

08:43.456 --> 08:45.893
Shh.

08:45.926 --> 08:48.161
CROWD:
Surprise!

08:48.195 --> 08:50.564
(crowd cheering)

08:50.598 --> 08:53.333
EDDIE:
As of one hour ago,

08:53.366 --> 08:55.603
Tiana has done what no other
artist in the history

08:55.636 --> 08:57.504
of Empire has ever done before.

08:57.537 --> 09:00.173
Her single simultaneously
went to number one

09:00.207 --> 09:04.011
on both the R&B and Pop charts.

09:04.044 --> 09:05.879
(crowd cheering)

09:05.913 --> 09:09.249
And no offense,
not even our Lyon boys

09:09.282 --> 09:11.018
-have achieved that feat.
-(crowd chuckling)

09:11.051 --> 09:12.786
-(scoffs) Not yet.
-Ah.

09:12.820 --> 09:15.856
Another Empire first:

09:15.889 --> 09:17.691
Tory Ash's new album

09:17.725 --> 09:21.528
has hit number one
on the new R&B charts.

09:21.561 --> 09:23.563
-(crowd cheering)
-Here's to

09:23.597 --> 09:26.199
many other
record-breaking moments.

09:26.233 --> 09:27.534
(chuckles)

09:27.567 --> 09:29.870
-Cheers.
-CROWD: Cheers.

09:29.903 --> 09:32.072
-Thank you.
-You're amazing.

09:32.105 --> 09:34.775
CROWD (chanting):
Tiana! Tiana! Tiana!

09:34.808 --> 09:37.778
Tiana! Tiana!

09:37.811 --> 09:40.580
Tiana! (cheering)

09:40.614 --> 09:43.617
("Sweat" playing)

09:46.486 --> 09:49.790
* You like the way I move,
and, boy, I know you want it *

09:49.823 --> 09:52.793
* You got a lot to prove,
you better jump up on it *

09:52.826 --> 09:55.595
* You know what I can do,
no time for sleeping on it *

09:55.629 --> 09:57.464
* I'm-a leave it open

09:57.497 --> 09:59.099
* And see what you gon' do
right there *

09:59.132 --> 10:02.302
* You say you want control,
but can you handle me? *

10:02.335 --> 10:05.305
* We can go fast or slow,
might have you on your knees *

10:05.338 --> 10:07.507
* I want to see you

10:07.540 --> 10:11.344
* Work hard for me, baby

10:11.378 --> 10:13.647
* Uh, sweat

10:13.681 --> 10:15.282
* Sweat

10:15.315 --> 10:17.317
(rhythmic panting)

10:17.350 --> 10:18.819
* Sweat

10:18.852 --> 10:20.788
(rhythmic panting)

10:20.821 --> 10:22.255
* Sweat

10:22.289 --> 10:24.357
* Oh, sweat...

10:24.391 --> 10:28.461
Thanks for bringing in Eddie.
He's a genius.

10:28.495 --> 10:29.763
I'm having dinner
with him later.

10:29.797 --> 10:32.465
Why don't I float the idea
of him staying?

10:32.499 --> 10:34.467
We don't want him
going anywhere.

10:34.501 --> 10:36.837
*

10:51.719 --> 10:54.822
Now, here's every single artist
on 20 For 20.

10:54.855 --> 10:56.289
Here's the particular stages

10:56.323 --> 10:58.625
where their albums are
right now.

10:58.658 --> 11:00.160
And here's that punk
Eddie Barker.

11:00.193 --> 11:02.863
He's got completed albums.
He's got number one hits.

11:02.896 --> 11:05.799
Look at where you guys are,
Hakeem, Jamal.

11:05.833 --> 11:07.901
Y'all are pumping out zeroes
when right now I need y'all

11:07.935 --> 11:10.637
to be pumping out hits
with the name Lyon on them.

11:10.670 --> 11:13.540
Dad, I'm ready to drop my single
right now. It's fire.

11:13.573 --> 11:15.075
LUCIOUS: Okay, well,
then get with marketing,

11:15.108 --> 11:17.978
let them know that this needs
to debut at number one.

11:18.011 --> 11:20.347
-Okay.
-Where are you?

11:20.380 --> 11:22.349
Dad, you-you do know
that you benched me, right?

11:22.382 --> 11:23.683
Well, consider yourself
back in the game,

11:23.717 --> 11:25.185
and don't tell me you spent

11:25.218 --> 11:26.920
-all this time crying.
-Nah, hell no.

11:26.954 --> 11:29.656
I've been working my ass off.
And the stuff is really good.

11:29.689 --> 11:31.391
Yeah, well as long as
it's not some of that

11:31.424 --> 11:32.659
off-brand Jamal junk.

11:32.692 --> 11:34.494
Oh, so now my stuff
is just junk?

11:34.527 --> 11:35.896
Dad, you the one
that always said

11:35.929 --> 11:37.998
put your heart and soul
into music, yeah?

11:38.031 --> 11:40.934
Listen, son, I don't have time
to sit here swaddling you.

11:40.968 --> 11:43.503
I need you to get
in the studio and produce

11:43.536 --> 11:45.705
that on-brand Jamal stuff.

11:45.739 --> 11:48.675
Oh, so, the same old stuff?

11:48.708 --> 11:50.043
But that's what
I'm talking about.

11:50.077 --> 11:51.411
I can't go backwards.

11:51.444 --> 11:55.282
So just count me out
of the 20 For 20.

11:55.315 --> 11:57.250
ANDRE: Thanks for meeting
with me, Reverend.

11:57.284 --> 11:59.719
Hmm. I'm glad you reached out.

11:59.753 --> 12:03.190
So, how did your confession go?

12:03.223 --> 12:06.426
Father's utterly incapable
of forgiveness.

12:06.459 --> 12:08.929
What's new?

12:08.962 --> 12:12.299
Well, no father is perfect.

12:12.332 --> 12:14.567
Save that for the Father above.

12:18.138 --> 12:21.141
Lucious is messed up,
and he passed it on to me.

12:23.944 --> 12:28.315
In my opinion,
you can't fix your father.

12:28.348 --> 12:30.417
But you can fix yourself.

12:34.287 --> 12:36.890
The difference between
you and Lucious

12:36.924 --> 12:39.492
is that you want
to do the right thing.

12:39.526 --> 12:41.361
Encourage that part of yourself.

12:43.430 --> 12:44.764
(sighs)

12:44.798 --> 12:47.334
I don't know where to start.

12:47.367 --> 12:49.502
You already started.

12:49.536 --> 12:51.571
You confessed.

12:51.604 --> 12:54.107
You were sincere in your regret,

12:54.141 --> 12:57.577
so be sincere in your apologies
to those you've hurt.

12:57.610 --> 12:59.612
Come on.

13:04.818 --> 13:06.453
You know
what's so ridiculous, too,

13:06.486 --> 13:08.188
is that these days, my father
wouldn't know originality

13:08.221 --> 13:09.689
if it kicked him
in the damn head.

13:09.722 --> 13:10.858
Well, it's not like
Eddie's any better.

13:10.891 --> 13:12.759
He's trying to turn me into
some R&B diva.

13:12.792 --> 13:15.662
Okay, but nobody cares
about genres anymore.

13:15.695 --> 13:18.031
-They just want good music.
-What about our music?

13:18.065 --> 13:20.133
You really think that Empire's
just not gonna release it?

13:20.167 --> 13:22.769
No, I know that they're not.

13:22.802 --> 13:25.338
But why does that have to stop
us? You know what I'm saying?

13:25.372 --> 13:27.207
Why can't we release it
under a different name?

13:27.240 --> 13:29.309
-What do you mean?
-Meaning don't put
our names on it,

13:29.342 --> 13:31.178
don't put our pictures on it,
'cause then that way

13:31.211 --> 13:32.645
it could actually be
about the music.

13:32.679 --> 13:34.614
Kind of like a Daft Punk,
Gorillaz vibe?

13:34.647 --> 13:35.949
-See, now you feeling me.
-Okay.

13:35.983 --> 13:38.051
Look, we could even,
I don't know,

13:38.085 --> 13:39.853
add some other dope musicians.

13:39.887 --> 13:40.988
-Like, start a band?
-No.

13:41.021 --> 13:42.522
Better than a band.
Like, a, um...

13:42.555 --> 13:44.491
like, a collective.
You know what I'm saying?

13:44.524 --> 13:47.460
We bounce off of each other.
We-we feed each other's ideas.

13:47.494 --> 13:50.063
-Yeah, I dig that.
-Look. Watch this artist.

13:50.097 --> 13:52.165
I've been trying to work
with him for a minute.

13:52.199 --> 13:53.967
* I was above 'em,
no bluffin', if, ands or buts *

13:54.001 --> 13:55.335
* And ain't no time
for a discussion *

13:55.368 --> 13:56.636
* The governments
can't be trusted *

13:56.669 --> 13:57.971
* The streets about to erupt

13:58.005 --> 13:59.973
* In flames, insanity,
sufferin' *

14:00.007 --> 14:01.308
* Alhamdulillah above me

14:01.341 --> 14:02.709
* The only one
that can judge me *

14:02.742 --> 14:04.077
* I'm wonderin'
where the love be... *

14:04.111 --> 14:05.345
-(laughs)
-(Jamal chuckles)

14:05.378 --> 14:07.214
See? And Becky tried
to sign him last year,

14:07.247 --> 14:09.249
but because he's smart,
he passed.

14:09.282 --> 14:12.485
Because he's a real, raw,
authentic artist.

14:12.519 --> 14:13.853
Imagine what we could create
with someone like that

14:13.887 --> 14:15.855
-on our team.
-Yeah, it would be incredible.

14:15.889 --> 14:17.024
But you know that there's no way

14:17.057 --> 14:18.525
that Empire's
gonna let us do that.

14:18.558 --> 14:20.928
Okay, well, you know we don't
have to tell them anything.

14:20.961 --> 14:25.565
Well, I have no problem
with that. (laughs)

14:25.598 --> 14:28.101
Shoot, man, it smells like
someone died in here.

14:28.135 --> 14:29.602
It does.

14:29.636 --> 14:31.338
What the hell is this?

14:31.371 --> 14:33.206
A bangin'-ass basement.

14:33.240 --> 14:35.342
All right, how the hell
is this gonna help me

14:35.375 --> 14:36.743
land a number one single?

14:36.776 --> 14:38.778
Didn't your moms and pops
hook up back in the day

14:38.811 --> 14:41.048
-at a Philly basement party?
-Yeah. So?

14:41.081 --> 14:43.083
It was one of Lucious's
first performances

14:43.116 --> 14:45.785
before he blew up, man;
it was legendary.

14:45.818 --> 14:47.854
If your folks
never hooked up that night,

14:47.887 --> 14:49.856
you might not
have been born, bro.

14:49.889 --> 14:51.124
You know you sound
high as hell, bro?

14:51.158 --> 14:54.227
-(chuckles)
-Come on, man. Can't you see it?

14:54.261 --> 14:56.796
The year is 1991, all right?

14:56.829 --> 14:58.932
Speakers in every corner.

14:58.966 --> 15:01.201
A big platform stage
with a old-school booth

15:01.234 --> 15:02.602
you can rock, Chicken.

15:02.635 --> 15:04.871
The party of the year, man,
hosted by

15:04.904 --> 15:08.241
the one and only
Hakeem "The Dream" Lyon,

15:08.275 --> 15:10.277
launching his new banger.

15:11.945 --> 15:14.747
Keep it a hundred, you do sound
high as hell, Blake.

15:14.781 --> 15:17.951
ANDRE:
It's actually not a bad idea.

15:17.985 --> 15:20.287
-Dre, what are you doing here?
-Becky told me where you were.

15:20.320 --> 15:22.855
I'm just here to help.

15:25.358 --> 15:28.895
Listen...

15:28.928 --> 15:32.599
I know you feel
some kind of way about me.

15:32.632 --> 15:34.467
I let everything that was wrong

15:34.501 --> 15:36.836
push everything that was right
out of my head.

15:36.869 --> 15:38.738
And that won't happen again,
I promise you.

15:38.771 --> 15:42.575
I want to be your big brother,
if you'll let me.

15:42.609 --> 15:44.911
All I care about
is being number one right now.

15:44.944 --> 15:48.848
If we put this whole party
up on Empire XStream,

15:48.881 --> 15:51.818
every subscriber that clicks
on it will get a free download.

15:51.851 --> 15:53.987
Now, those count
as sales, Hakeem.

15:54.021 --> 15:55.688
Your numbers will go up.

15:55.722 --> 15:57.324
You're practically guaranteed
to knock Tiana

15:57.357 --> 15:59.126
out of the number one spot.

16:05.398 --> 16:08.168
I guess we throwing
a basement party, then, y'all.

16:08.201 --> 16:10.203
(whooping, excited chatter)

16:12.805 --> 16:15.708
EDNA: I hope you'll extend
your stay at Empire.

16:15.742 --> 16:18.711
I have such an affinity
for you, Edward.

16:18.745 --> 16:20.780
Please, Edna. It's-it's Eddie.

16:20.813 --> 16:23.116
-Of course.
-Giselle?

16:23.150 --> 16:26.286
-Oh.
-What are you doing here?

16:26.319 --> 16:28.321
Your receptionist
said to meet you here.

16:28.355 --> 16:29.856
Uh, must be a scheduling mix-up.

16:29.889 --> 16:31.391
-Oh.
-(both chuckle)

16:31.424 --> 16:35.862
Edna, this is my ex-wife,
Giselle.

16:35.895 --> 16:38.131
Giselle, this is Edna.

16:38.165 --> 16:41.000
-Hello.
-Nice to meet you. (chuckles)

16:41.034 --> 16:42.235
See you later.

16:42.269 --> 16:44.504
-Talk soon? Okay.
-Talk later.

16:44.537 --> 16:47.174
Edward Cornelius Damn Barker.

16:47.207 --> 16:49.709
Expensive champagne
won't make up for what you did.

16:49.742 --> 16:51.311
I want my money.

16:51.344 --> 16:53.012
Celeste, not now, all right?
Not now.

16:55.882 --> 16:57.717
And what's this slut doing here?

16:57.750 --> 16:59.852
Oh, that's real classy, Celeste.

16:59.886 --> 17:01.088
You want to know about class?

17:01.121 --> 17:04.157
Why are both y'all
thirsty sluts here?

17:04.191 --> 17:05.258
Oh, hell no!

17:05.292 --> 17:07.560
-Monique?
-Eddie Barker.

17:07.594 --> 17:09.028
-Mm-hmm.
-Unless we're all here

17:09.062 --> 17:11.164
to discuss why you lost
all our money,

17:11.198 --> 17:12.765
I am not trying to be
in the company

17:12.799 --> 17:15.735
of your past, present
or future foolishness.

17:15.768 --> 17:17.070
(chuckles):
Oh, n-no.

17:17.104 --> 17:19.038
We're not in a relationship.

17:19.072 --> 17:20.407
Unless...

17:20.440 --> 17:22.375
-Eddie?
-CELESTE: Obviously
you're not together.

17:22.409 --> 17:24.611
Look around you, sweetie.

17:24.644 --> 17:26.413
One of these ladies
doesn't belong

17:26.446 --> 17:28.448
-with the others.
-Really?

17:28.481 --> 17:30.450
I'll just see myself out.

17:30.483 --> 17:34.221
Uh, Edna. Edna. Uh...

17:34.254 --> 17:36.256
I'd like you to stay.

17:36.289 --> 17:38.291
This is just
a big misunderstanding.

17:38.325 --> 17:41.628
(laughs) Yes, a colossal
misunderstanding, Mr. Barker.

17:41.661 --> 17:44.731
Now that Lucious is back,
you should take this opportunity

17:44.764 --> 17:47.100
to focus on
your personal affairs.

17:47.134 --> 17:48.868
(sighs)

17:48.901 --> 17:50.470
Good night.

17:50.503 --> 17:52.472
-I'll call you later.
-You can try.

17:52.505 --> 17:54.241
* It's just something
you gon' learn, too *

17:54.274 --> 17:56.643
* It's your turn for me to be
the one you turn to... *

17:56.676 --> 17:58.478
Compliments of the boss.

17:58.511 --> 18:00.780
Boss?

18:05.285 --> 18:07.987
(scoffs) Wow.

18:09.589 --> 18:11.558
It's on.

18:11.591 --> 18:13.593
*

18:20.300 --> 18:22.269
Those bitches ruined everything.

18:22.302 --> 18:24.471
Edna was a key ally.
Now that pasty heifer

18:24.504 --> 18:26.005
won't even return
my phone calls.

18:26.038 --> 18:28.007
It was hard enough
for you to pull off a coup

18:28.040 --> 18:29.342
behind Lucious's back;
how are you gonna do it

18:29.376 --> 18:30.777
when he's looking right at you?

18:30.810 --> 18:33.746
-By making a new ally.
-What are you talking about?

18:33.780 --> 18:35.782
Over there.

18:36.849 --> 18:38.017
(short chuckle)

18:38.050 --> 18:40.019
All right.

18:40.052 --> 18:42.189
No, no.

18:42.222 --> 18:45.925
Handle your business,
and I'll be right over there.

18:45.958 --> 18:47.960
What? Nothing for good luck?

18:50.830 --> 18:53.166
Back in the day,
I never would've pegged you

18:53.200 --> 18:55.768
as someone who'd have a seat
at the table.

18:55.802 --> 19:00.273
You were always so impulsive,
quick to pull the trigger

19:00.307 --> 19:03.710
without even being sure that
the gun was loaded. (chuckles)

19:07.247 --> 19:09.649
Is that why you convinced
Lucious to drop me

19:09.682 --> 19:11.384
all those years ago?

19:11.418 --> 19:13.486
And I'd like
to right that wrong.

19:13.520 --> 19:16.189
I gave Lucious the tools
to be able to create an empire.

19:16.223 --> 19:18.191
I'd like to do the same for you.

19:18.225 --> 19:22.028
(chuckles)
And my, uh, 25% stake

19:22.061 --> 19:24.464
has nothing to do
with your generous offer?

19:24.497 --> 19:27.467
We're too big to be hustling
somebody else's dream.

19:27.500 --> 19:29.068
I'm listening.

19:29.101 --> 19:31.070
Lucious always wanted
to roll solo.

19:31.103 --> 19:33.906
He's never gonna value
anybody else

19:33.940 --> 19:35.808
more than he values himself.

19:35.842 --> 19:39.879
But I value what you do.

19:39.912 --> 19:42.715
I'm gonna make a pitch
to the board

19:42.749 --> 19:44.651
to expand my role here.

19:44.684 --> 19:47.520
You want to be on top?

19:47.554 --> 19:50.056
Back me up.

19:53.793 --> 19:56.263
-(snaps fingers)
-Come on, man.

19:59.532 --> 20:01.401
Where's that impulse?

20:03.436 --> 20:06.205
Is the gun loaded?

20:08.241 --> 20:10.310
Always, my brother.

20:14.781 --> 20:17.183
-Okay.
-All right, then.

20:17.216 --> 20:19.586
We got a lot of things
we're gonna be doing together.

20:19.619 --> 20:21.254
-We'll have some fun.
-I'll tell you what.

20:21.288 --> 20:23.256
Come by the studio later.

20:23.290 --> 20:25.057
-Mm-hmm?
-I got this new white boy.

20:25.091 --> 20:29.396
I think you can help
make us both rich.

20:29.429 --> 20:30.863
-(tattoo needle buzzing)
-AZAL: Don't worry.

20:30.897 --> 20:32.799
Gonna have your tattoos.
Just try not to move.

20:32.832 --> 20:33.966
-MAN: All right.
-(bell chimes)

20:34.000 --> 20:35.402
AZAL: Design book's
on the table, sir.

20:35.435 --> 20:37.304
Pick a tattoo.
Be with you in a sec.

20:37.337 --> 20:40.273
Oh, no, no.
We just, uh, we actually want

20:40.307 --> 20:42.542
-a bit of your time to talk.
-Time's money.

20:42.575 --> 20:45.478
Which one's talking,
which one's getting a tattoo?

20:47.514 --> 20:48.915
I mean...

20:48.948 --> 20:50.617
JAMAL:
It's about the collective.

20:50.650 --> 20:53.119
You know what I'm saying?

20:53.152 --> 20:55.555
Look, I... do not
play well with others.

20:55.588 --> 20:57.223
(chuckles)
See, that's the thing is

20:57.256 --> 20:59.792
the band that we're creating
is not about egos.

20:59.826 --> 21:01.994
Yeah, it's just about the music.

21:02.028 --> 21:04.664
And with you on the mic
with your raw, visceral,

21:04.697 --> 21:07.967
conscious lyrics,
I really do think that we could

21:08.000 --> 21:09.602
make music history.

21:09.636 --> 21:12.905
Let me tell you something
about history, bruh.

21:12.939 --> 21:14.441
It's written by the victors.

21:14.474 --> 21:16.443
And I don't see no victory
by signing

21:16.476 --> 21:17.944
with a privileged cat
from hip-hop royalty

21:17.977 --> 21:20.179
trying to be down
with the people.

21:20.212 --> 21:21.981
-Feel me?
-(chuckles)

21:22.014 --> 21:23.416
Let me tell you something, bruh.

21:23.450 --> 21:26.285
You obviously don't know
where my family comes from,

21:26.319 --> 21:28.355
and you probably
don't even listen

21:28.388 --> 21:30.323
-to my music, so...
-Okay, yeah.

21:30.357 --> 21:32.124
Real talk.
I don't need a collective

21:32.158 --> 21:34.494
or a Lyon
to get my message across.

21:35.695 --> 21:37.597
May I focus?

21:37.630 --> 21:39.466
Ow.

21:39.499 --> 21:41.300
That'll be $200.

21:41.334 --> 21:44.203
Pay cash or card?

21:44.236 --> 21:45.638
("Sweat" playing)

21:45.672 --> 21:47.807
* You been craving my touch

21:47.840 --> 21:49.008
* Ain't no use
tryin' to hide it *

21:49.041 --> 21:50.309
* Wantin' me like a drug

21:50.343 --> 21:51.878
* I promise you gon' like it

21:51.911 --> 21:53.446
* I'm-a leave it open

21:53.480 --> 21:55.214
* And see what you gon' do
right there *

21:55.247 --> 21:57.950
* You say you want control,
but can you handle me? *

21:57.984 --> 22:01.488
* We can go fast or slow,
might have you on your knees *

22:01.521 --> 22:04.491
* I want to see you work hard

22:04.524 --> 22:06.726
* For me, baby

22:06.759 --> 22:09.662
* Uh, sweat

22:09.696 --> 22:12.064
-* Sweat
-(rhythmic panting)

22:12.098 --> 22:15.201
* Sweat

22:16.102 --> 22:19.639
* Sweat, uh

22:19.672 --> 22:21.674
-* Sweat
-* Sweat, till it's drippin'
off your body *

22:21.708 --> 22:23.843
* Like a faucet,
uh, sweat till... *

22:23.876 --> 22:25.578
(music stops)

22:25.612 --> 22:27.046
(Maya gasping)

22:27.079 --> 22:30.483
Oh, my God. I-I...

22:30.517 --> 22:33.553
I am, like, your biggest fan.

22:33.586 --> 22:35.321
My name's Maya.

22:35.354 --> 22:37.924
Is this the new choreographer
that Eddie just approved?

22:37.957 --> 22:39.759
How old are you, 13?

22:39.792 --> 22:41.928
COOKIE:
Uh, Eddie's not the CEO.

22:41.961 --> 22:44.697
I invited Maya here
from NYU to audition.

22:44.731 --> 22:47.500
NYU?
Cookie, I'm number one

22:47.534 --> 22:49.268
on the Pop and the R&B charts.

22:49.301 --> 22:50.837
And the best
that you can offer me is

22:50.870 --> 22:52.539
-some amateur from...
-Uh, hey, hey, uh!

22:52.572 --> 22:54.741
Mm-mmm. Hold your tongue.

22:54.774 --> 22:57.577
Maya, why don't you take
a break, sweetheart?

22:57.610 --> 23:00.379
Very impressive.
You like a little Misty, girl.

23:00.413 --> 23:02.582
(chuckles):
Yes!

23:05.785 --> 23:09.021
Now, I know Eddie
has you feeling like a big star.

23:09.055 --> 23:12.258
I get it, and I'm very proud
of you, Tiana.

23:12.291 --> 23:14.226
But that doesn't give you
the right to walk around

23:14.260 --> 23:16.463
and act like a big bitch.

23:16.496 --> 23:18.931
I'm the only big bitch
around here, sweetie.

23:18.965 --> 23:20.933
And let's not forget
who made you.

23:20.967 --> 23:23.603
'Cause I would hate
to have to unmake you.

23:23.636 --> 23:26.873
Now, you come in here
and you disrupt something

23:26.906 --> 23:30.610
I got going on again, and I will
wipe your ass off the charts!

23:30.643 --> 23:34.246
Give a damn what number you are.

23:34.280 --> 23:35.982
Maya.

23:36.015 --> 23:37.984
-Maya, slow down.
-I must've had "fool"

23:38.017 --> 23:40.252
written across my forehead
to think I was good enough

23:40.286 --> 23:42.421
-to work with Tiana.
-Listen to me.

23:42.455 --> 23:44.624
You are nobody's fool, okay?

23:44.657 --> 23:46.292
You are a gifted, talented woman

23:46.325 --> 23:48.160
who's gonna make her mother
very proud.

23:48.194 --> 23:51.464
My mom is proud of me. She's the
one that encouraged me to dance.

23:51.498 --> 23:53.966
I mean your birth mother.

23:54.000 --> 23:55.835
How do you know I'm adopted?

23:55.868 --> 23:58.270
I know your real mom.

23:58.304 --> 24:01.508
My real m... mom?

24:01.541 --> 24:05.077
-I was in prison with her.
-You mean the crackhead killer?

24:05.111 --> 24:08.515
She's not a killer.
She... That was self-defense.

24:08.548 --> 24:11.183
And she didn't...
she didn't do drugs, okay?

24:11.217 --> 24:13.185
She-she may have dealt drugs

24:13.219 --> 24:15.354
to get money so that she can try

24:15.387 --> 24:17.757
and find you, because you
were stolen from her, Maya.

24:17.790 --> 24:19.792
She really wants to meet you.

24:19.826 --> 24:23.796
Okay? And I promised her
that I would find you.

24:23.830 --> 24:25.998
She loves you so much.

24:26.032 --> 24:28.167
No.

24:28.200 --> 24:29.969
She's dying.

24:30.002 --> 24:32.171
No, she's dead.
She was dead to me the moment

24:32.204 --> 24:33.773
-that she decided to give me up.
-You don't...

24:33.806 --> 24:35.174
No, please just
stay away from me.

24:35.207 --> 24:36.976
'Cause I don't want to hear
from you

24:37.009 --> 24:39.712
or that woman in lockup ever.

24:45.484 --> 24:48.621
-(door buzzes)
-So, you got to get locked up

24:48.655 --> 24:51.023
before I can see you, huh?

24:51.057 --> 24:52.992
I don't have nothing
to say to you, lady.

24:53.025 --> 24:56.395
Okay. I'll do the talking.

24:56.428 --> 24:57.997
(exhales)

24:58.030 --> 24:59.832
-Can I smoke in here?
-Yeah, sure.

24:59.866 --> 25:02.702
Why don't you go out by the pool
or the tennis courts? (chuckles)

25:02.735 --> 25:05.204
The hell you think you are?

25:07.206 --> 25:10.643
I'm in a place where
I never expected to see you.

25:10.677 --> 25:14.380
Of my three girls,

25:14.413 --> 25:15.882
you most remind me of myself.

25:15.915 --> 25:17.984
Please don't insult me.

25:18.017 --> 25:20.086
Why are you even here?

25:20.119 --> 25:22.822
Because if I was there
with you girls,

25:22.855 --> 25:24.190
you would not be in here.

25:24.223 --> 25:27.359
Uh, please don't
flatter yourself. (mutters)

25:27.393 --> 25:29.696
Loretha,
sit your narrow ass down!

25:34.300 --> 25:36.636
I'm not finished.

25:40.439 --> 25:43.676
* It's a new wave, let me see
your hands in the air *

25:43.710 --> 25:45.444
* Plus, we getting money
round here *

25:45.477 --> 25:47.914
* And they love the way
them Lambo doors in the air *

25:47.947 --> 25:49.115
* Them baddies leaving with us

25:49.148 --> 25:50.282
* Leave them haters
over there... *

25:50.316 --> 25:52.118
Where's this new white boy?

25:52.151 --> 25:54.353
Let's see
if he lives up to your hype.

25:54.386 --> 25:55.955
* Plus, we getting money
around here... *

25:55.988 --> 25:58.257
-(music stops)
-(door opens)

25:58.290 --> 25:59.959
(whistles)

25:59.992 --> 26:03.796
You didn't think twice
about chucking your man here.

26:03.830 --> 26:06.733
Ain't no telling how fast
you'd get rid of my ass.

26:08.334 --> 26:10.402
Me and L ain't white on rice.

26:10.436 --> 26:12.238
But like my Hillary vote,

26:12.271 --> 26:15.174
I'm just siding
with the devil I know.

26:17.610 --> 26:19.779
You know she lost, right?

26:21.781 --> 26:23.415
Well, in that case, Eddie,

26:23.449 --> 26:25.885
you and Hillary
got a whole lot in common.

26:25.918 --> 26:28.921
Knowing that the lesser man
thinks he won?

26:28.955 --> 26:31.223
(chuckles)
Maybe so.

26:31.257 --> 26:33.325
That wasn't about loyalty,
you know?

26:33.359 --> 26:36.162
That was self-interest.

26:36.195 --> 26:38.330
Eddie, you wouldn't know loyalty

26:38.364 --> 26:41.600
if it smacked you right
in the middle of your face.

26:41.634 --> 26:43.903
Brother, we have...

26:43.936 --> 26:47.439
very distinct definitions
of that word.

26:47.473 --> 26:51.177
You may be loyal to your own,
but what you really are

26:51.210 --> 26:53.112
is lethal.

26:53.145 --> 26:55.114
Poison.

26:55.147 --> 26:58.951
Everything you touch
corrupts and dies around you.

26:58.985 --> 27:01.087
And if you needed any more proof

27:01.120 --> 27:04.590
of just how toxic
you really are,

27:04.623 --> 27:05.992
look no further than Cookie.

27:06.025 --> 27:09.528
The woman nearly died
because of you.

27:13.565 --> 27:15.835
You're pushing me, Eddie.

27:15.868 --> 27:18.637
And you of all people know...

27:18.671 --> 27:22.274
how lethal I can be.

27:22.308 --> 27:24.510
Of course I do.

27:24.543 --> 27:27.013
I taught you.

27:27.046 --> 27:29.048
But...

27:29.081 --> 27:33.485
it's just as dangerous
to push me around.

27:35.922 --> 27:37.890
We ain't done.

27:37.924 --> 27:39.826
Come on.

27:39.859 --> 27:41.828
Not even close.

27:47.399 --> 27:48.901
* Hey, Dirty...

27:48.935 --> 27:50.636
It's a basement, but there's
a lot of things to shoot.

27:50.669 --> 27:52.038
Some colors
and those cups right here.

27:52.071 --> 27:53.505
-Got it.
-Take advantage of that.

27:53.539 --> 27:55.507
Film Hakeem.
It's his single release party.

27:55.541 --> 27:58.477
What up? Stay tuned, baby.

27:58.510 --> 28:00.312
WOMAN:
Hakeem, I love you!

28:00.346 --> 28:02.314
Thank you all for coming.

28:02.348 --> 28:04.316
Chicken.

28:04.350 --> 28:06.052
Jamal said he would be here.

28:06.085 --> 28:07.519
-He late.
-I haven't seen him.

28:07.553 --> 28:09.521
Meanwhile,
Sir-Talk-A-Lot right here

28:09.555 --> 28:11.390
hasn't paid the venue owners,
so now they're threatening

28:11.423 --> 28:13.760
-to pull the plug
on this whole thing.
-What?

28:13.793 --> 28:15.995
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Don't worry about it, Hakeem.

28:16.028 --> 28:17.563
I'll handle it.

28:17.596 --> 28:19.165
-Why don't you
show me who to pay.
-All right.

28:19.198 --> 28:22.668
-Yeah, show him who to pay.
-All right. It's okay.

28:22.701 --> 28:24.270
-Jamal Lyon!
-(reporters clamoring)

28:24.303 --> 28:26.338
Jamal Lyon, over here!

28:26.372 --> 28:28.040
Jamal Lyon!

28:28.074 --> 28:31.043
I'm sorry. I got you.
All right? I'm sorry.

28:31.077 --> 28:33.679
Can we get a photo
with the three brothers?

28:33.712 --> 28:36.215
-Uh, sure.
-All three of you.

28:38.250 --> 28:40.386
Listen, after this,
can we, uh, can we talk?

28:40.419 --> 28:41.553
-Nah.
-* Hey, Dirty

28:41.587 --> 28:43.622
* Sing it

28:43.655 --> 28:45.624
-* Baby, I got your money
-* Sing it, girls

28:45.657 --> 28:47.726
-* Don't you worry, I said hey
-* Just shake it right...

28:47.760 --> 28:49.595
Y'all, please give it up
for my little brother,

28:49.628 --> 28:51.630
Hakeem Lyon,
performing his first

28:51.663 --> 28:55.067
20 For 20 single,
"Rock the Party"!

28:55.101 --> 28:56.368
(crowd cheering)

28:56.402 --> 28:58.771
("Rock the Party" playing)

29:00.940 --> 29:03.575
* Uh, you know what's up
when I pull up *

29:03.609 --> 29:05.945
* Everybody watching,
all the girls running back *

29:05.978 --> 29:07.079
* I'm picking
through my options *

29:07.113 --> 29:08.214
* Gettin' cake

29:08.247 --> 29:09.916
* Like I'm playin' Shopkins

29:09.949 --> 29:11.417
* Green faces
like I'm The Mask *

29:11.450 --> 29:14.053
* Somebody stop me,
fresh fade, black shades *

29:14.086 --> 29:15.487
* I'm kind of a big deal

29:15.521 --> 29:16.823
* In the club
looking for a third piece *

29:16.856 --> 29:18.825
* Big wheel,
all this liquor in me *

29:18.858 --> 29:20.626
* Kinda hard
for me to sit still *

29:20.659 --> 29:22.128
* D'Angelo wit' the flow

29:22.161 --> 29:24.230
* Tell me, how does it feel?
How it feel? *

29:24.263 --> 29:26.265
* You know Hakeem,
I rock the party *

29:26.298 --> 29:27.733
* You know Hakeem

29:27.766 --> 29:29.001
CROWD:
* Rock the party!

29:29.035 --> 29:31.670
* You know Hakeem,
I rock the party *

29:31.703 --> 29:35.141
* Girl, back it up,
work your body... *

29:35.174 --> 29:37.276
Girl, you said this was
a '90s basement jam,

29:37.309 --> 29:39.011
not no Hakeem release party.

29:39.045 --> 29:41.747
I'm not here for him.
I'm here to have fun.

29:41.780 --> 29:45.684
Plus, all of my people are here,
so why shouldn't I be here?

29:45.717 --> 29:48.821
* Okay, the turn up is real,
party in the hills... *

29:48.855 --> 29:50.656
Bitches.

29:50.689 --> 29:52.925
* Done deal,
ride through the city *

29:52.959 --> 29:55.661
* Sun glisten off the wheels,
top off, sun roofin' *

29:55.694 --> 29:57.930
* Like I'm Dr. Phil,
straight gorilla my flowin' *

29:57.964 --> 29:59.665
* Like you know I'm a animal

29:59.698 --> 30:01.133
* Wordplay, intangible,
automatic, mechanical *

30:01.167 --> 30:02.969
* Lyrically I'm a cannibal

30:03.002 --> 30:04.803
* Don't make me split
your cantaloupe *

30:04.837 --> 30:07.806
* Leave here wit' a centerfold,
bet I give her the antidote *

30:07.840 --> 30:10.642
* You know Hakeem,
I rock the party *

30:10.676 --> 30:13.312
* You know Hakeem, I rock
the party *

30:13.345 --> 30:14.513
(crowd cheering)

30:14.546 --> 30:15.681
CROWD:
* Rock the party!

30:15.714 --> 30:17.383
* Girl, back it up

30:17.416 --> 30:18.817
* Work your body

30:18.851 --> 30:20.119
* That's how it be
when I'm out *

30:20.152 --> 30:21.653
* Wit' my peeps and I got

30:21.687 --> 30:23.389
* What it takes
to rock the party *

30:23.422 --> 30:25.824
* Yeah, girl,
come back it up in my face... *

30:25.858 --> 30:27.526
CHICKEN:
Hey, man, what you doing?

30:27.559 --> 30:29.361
-* Take it back to my place
-* Uh, yeah, uh

30:29.395 --> 30:31.964
* It's the mythical,
analytical, not the typical *

30:31.998 --> 30:34.901
* Ice form in the physical,
rare biblical *

30:34.934 --> 30:37.736
* I don't play to lose,
no pity, y'all pitiful *

30:37.769 --> 30:40.539
* Get money, I don't snooze,
think rich, that's a ritual *

30:40.572 --> 30:42.208
* Cold wit' it,
yeah, I'm cold wit' it *

30:42.241 --> 30:44.210
* No control wit' it,
copper rims on the coupe *

30:44.243 --> 30:46.045
* Like I'm rollin'
four pennies *

30:46.078 --> 30:48.347
* No, I'm not from Harlem,
but I'm tryin' to trot *

30:48.380 --> 30:50.016
* Around the globe wit' it,
jacket on *

30:50.049 --> 30:51.817
* This a cold business, uh.

30:51.850 --> 30:55.121
(crowd cheering)

30:57.356 --> 30:58.757
So, you know you're not slick

30:58.790 --> 31:00.726
bringing me up
to your set like that.

31:00.759 --> 31:02.661
Babe, I didn't even know
you'd be here.

31:02.694 --> 31:05.031
-But I'm glad you came.
-Mm-hmm.

31:05.064 --> 31:07.233
Don't you got a press tour
in the morning?

31:07.266 --> 31:09.601
Look, Eddie's not here, so...

31:09.635 --> 31:12.871
tonight I'm off the hook.

31:12.905 --> 31:14.540
(chuckles)

31:14.573 --> 31:16.375
* I often tell myself

31:16.408 --> 31:20.712
* That we could be
more than just friends *

31:20.746 --> 31:24.083
* I know you think
that if we move too soon *

31:24.116 --> 31:25.851
* It would all end

31:25.884 --> 31:28.120
* I live in misery

31:28.154 --> 31:30.422
* When you're not around

31:30.456 --> 31:33.259
* There'll be some lovemaking

31:33.292 --> 31:35.894
* Heartbreaking, soul shaking

31:35.928 --> 31:38.064
* Oh

31:38.097 --> 31:42.034
* Lovemaking, heartbreaking,
soul shaking *

31:42.068 --> 31:44.636
* What's it gonna be?

31:44.670 --> 31:47.039
-* 'Cause I can't pretend
-* I can't pretend

31:47.073 --> 31:49.208
* No

31:49.241 --> 31:51.477
-* Don't you want to be
-* Don't you want to be

31:51.510 --> 31:53.479
* More than friends

31:53.512 --> 31:55.281
-(vocalizing)
-* Hold me tight

31:55.314 --> 31:57.449
* And don't let go

31:57.483 --> 31:59.351
* Don't let go.

32:02.688 --> 32:04.756
-* Here comes the hotstepper
-* Murderer

32:04.790 --> 32:07.059
-* I'm the lyrical gangster
-* Murderer

32:07.093 --> 32:09.795
-* Big up di crew ina di area
-* Murderer

32:09.828 --> 32:11.663
-* Still love you like that
-* Murderer...

32:11.697 --> 32:12.798
Becky.

32:12.831 --> 32:14.300
-Yeah?
-You seen, um, Tory?

32:14.333 --> 32:16.735
Uh, she's in the bathroom.
Have you seen Tiana?

32:16.768 --> 32:18.637
She has a 5:00 a.m. call time.

32:18.670 --> 32:20.672
I mean, you know
she bounced with Hakeem.

32:20.706 --> 32:23.275
-(groans)
-(chuckles)

32:23.309 --> 32:25.177
* Act like you know, Rico...

32:25.211 --> 32:26.845
Oh, word?

32:26.878 --> 32:29.081
What's up,
you coming to take shots

32:29.115 --> 32:30.916
at another member
of hip-hop royalty?

32:30.949 --> 32:33.185
Nah. I listened to your music.

32:33.219 --> 32:34.586
I was moved, brother.

32:34.620 --> 32:36.322
Seems like you have
something to say.

32:36.355 --> 32:38.624
I want to hear your message.
For real.

32:38.657 --> 32:40.159
This time without prejudice.

32:41.193 --> 32:43.129
Thank you, man.

32:43.162 --> 32:45.864
Tory also threatened
to blast my shop

32:45.897 --> 32:48.100
on her social media
if I didn't show up tonight.

32:48.134 --> 32:51.270
I see. So she blackmailed
your ass. Okay.

32:51.303 --> 32:54.273
-I ain't mad at her.
-Good move. (chuckles)

32:54.306 --> 32:57.343
Welcome to the band, man.

32:57.376 --> 32:58.777
* Cash rules everything
around me... *

32:58.810 --> 33:00.546
MAN:
A'ight, baby. There you go.

33:00.579 --> 33:02.481
* Dollar, dollar bill,
y'all... *

33:02.514 --> 33:04.516
Tory.

33:05.584 --> 33:06.852
-What the hell are you doing?
-Nothing.

33:06.885 --> 33:08.887
I'm just taking something
to take the edge off.

33:08.920 --> 33:10.489
How long you been using again?
What-what are you on?

33:10.522 --> 33:11.857
Eddie just gave me something
the other day

33:11.890 --> 33:12.991
-so I could get
through the show.
-Eddie gave you s...

33:13.025 --> 33:13.992
-Hey.
-Yeah. It's fine.

33:14.026 --> 33:15.161
-It's not a big deal.
-Listen,

33:15.194 --> 33:17.163
tomorrow we're going
to a meeting, Tory.

33:17.196 --> 33:19.798
Jamal, I'm a big girl. I don't
need you to be my sponsor, okay?

33:19.831 --> 33:21.800
* Rollin' with this one
and that one *

33:21.833 --> 33:23.569
* Pullin' out gats for fun

33:23.602 --> 33:25.137
* But it was just a dream

33:25.171 --> 33:26.705
* For the teen,
who was a fiend *

33:26.738 --> 33:28.407
* Started smokin' woolas
at 16... *

33:28.440 --> 33:30.076
I really needed this tonight.

33:30.109 --> 33:32.211
* And doin' hits
for high stakes *

33:32.244 --> 33:34.346
* Makin' my way
on fire escapes *

33:34.380 --> 33:37.483
* No question I would speed
for cracks and weed... *

33:37.516 --> 33:41.053
Anybody thinking you need
a makeover to be number one,

33:41.087 --> 33:45.324
they don't know
how amazing you already are.

33:45.357 --> 33:47.659
Always will be in my eyes.

33:47.693 --> 33:49.761
I love you.

33:49.795 --> 33:52.231
* Figured out
I went the wrong route *

33:52.264 --> 33:54.233
* So I got with
a sick, tight clique *

33:54.266 --> 33:56.235
* And went all out

33:56.268 --> 33:58.370
* Catchin' keys from 'cross
seas, rollin' in MPVs... *

33:58.404 --> 34:01.073
But I'm not gonna let Eddie
control you like some puppet.

34:03.209 --> 34:05.744
I'm nobody's puppet, okay?

34:05.777 --> 34:09.014
That's not what I meant.

34:09.047 --> 34:12.584
Look, you don't get to decide
or control who I work with.

34:12.618 --> 34:15.221
Eddie has done more for me
in six months

34:15.254 --> 34:17.956
than Empire's done for me
in three years.

34:19.958 --> 34:22.128
This was a mistake.

34:22.161 --> 34:25.364
No. This is real.

34:25.397 --> 34:27.099
Eddie told me
that you wasn't gonna be happy

34:27.133 --> 34:28.867
unless I was right up under you.

34:28.900 --> 34:30.636
-And you know what?
-(clicks tongue)

34:30.669 --> 34:31.737
He was right.

34:35.141 --> 34:36.742
Tiana!

34:37.909 --> 34:39.911
(sighs)

34:42.314 --> 34:44.650
'Sup?

34:44.683 --> 34:46.985
(hums, sighs)

34:47.018 --> 34:47.986
(elevator bell dings)

34:48.019 --> 34:50.055
Whoa.

34:50.088 --> 34:52.758
Back at work.
How's the orphan hunting going?

34:52.791 --> 34:54.326
If you want to keep
your balls intact,

34:54.360 --> 34:56.628
you didn't see me tonight, okay?

34:56.662 --> 34:58.297
So now you're threatening
my man parts over Orphan Black?

34:58.330 --> 35:00.266
You know, between you and
Lucious wanting to kill Eddie,

35:00.299 --> 35:01.600
y'all are just gonna
give me a stroke.

35:01.633 --> 35:03.902
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Kill Eddie?

35:03.935 --> 35:05.804
The hell are you talking about?

35:18.784 --> 35:20.919
Thirsty told me about Eddie.

35:20.952 --> 35:23.422
So all that talk about us
being equal partners

35:23.455 --> 35:26.091
and you respecting me
was just bull.

35:26.124 --> 35:27.826
Well, you lied about
your whereabouts all day.

35:27.859 --> 35:30.862
No, no, no.
I didn't lie to you, Lucious.

35:30.896 --> 35:33.199
I just didn't tell
your nosy ass.

35:33.232 --> 35:34.633
Well, there's a distinction
without a difference

35:34.666 --> 35:36.368
if I've ever heard one.

35:36.402 --> 35:39.305
Well, you lied about everything
being okay with Eddie. Why?

35:39.338 --> 35:41.607
And don't give me
that heart attack bull.

35:41.640 --> 35:43.675
Are you mad
'cause I brought him in?

35:43.709 --> 35:46.178
No, and don't you ever
think that.

35:46.212 --> 35:49.648
Everything that's gone wrong,
every bad thing that's happened,

35:49.681 --> 35:52.851
from Eddie to Claudia
to Andre...

35:55.086 --> 35:58.123
All of that's my fault.
I accept that.

35:58.156 --> 36:01.193
And some things
you-you can't change, but...

36:01.227 --> 36:03.895
I know how to fix Eddie.

36:03.929 --> 36:06.298
No. There's got to be
another way to get rid of Eddie.

36:06.332 --> 36:08.700
-Yeah, how?
-I don't know, Lucious.

36:08.734 --> 36:11.237
But we're gonna figure it out,
together.

36:21.680 --> 36:24.783
-Good morning, Mr. Barker.
-Morning, Juanita.

36:31.923 --> 36:33.259
Cookie.

36:33.292 --> 36:34.826
Lu. What is this?

36:34.860 --> 36:36.495
Firing squad?

36:36.528 --> 36:39.064
It was going to be.
But we're family, right?

36:39.097 --> 36:41.433
-Have a seat.
-Family.

36:41.467 --> 36:43.402
Yeah, see, all that plotting

36:43.435 --> 36:46.838
and scheming you were doing,
I had to remind Lucious that,

36:46.872 --> 36:50.376
uh, you guys were like brothers
back in the day.

36:50.409 --> 36:52.778
I said have a seat.

36:52.811 --> 36:54.713
All right.

36:58.250 --> 37:00.252
LUCIOUS:
Speaking of family,

37:00.286 --> 37:03.622
um, Hakeem's single just hit
number one on the charts.

37:03.655 --> 37:05.357
Wow. Hmm.

37:05.391 --> 37:07.759
Chalk one up for the Lyons,
against my two.

37:07.793 --> 37:10.061
(chuckles) I wonder
how the board would feel

37:10.095 --> 37:12.063
if they found out
that your two was acquired

37:12.097 --> 37:15.801
by doping up
a recovering addict.

37:15.834 --> 37:19.237
Tory? She was a wild card
way before I walked into Empire.

37:19.271 --> 37:20.806
But what about Tiana?

37:20.839 --> 37:23.642
I've seen single-handedly
how you bamboozled her.

37:23.675 --> 37:25.544
Once Lucious and I figured out

37:25.577 --> 37:28.547
what you were doing
with Tory and Tiana,

37:28.580 --> 37:29.981
well, we figured...
(chuckles)

37:30.015 --> 37:31.483
there had to be others.

37:31.517 --> 37:33.752
So we did a little digging.
Ivy Montgomery.

37:33.785 --> 37:37.222
A promising young starlet,
before she signed with you.

37:37.255 --> 37:39.991
She couldn't keep up
with your pressures,

37:40.025 --> 37:41.493
and you pumped her
full of drugs.

37:41.527 --> 37:43.795
Next thing you know,
she commits suicide,

37:43.829 --> 37:46.765
and she thought
you was family as well.

37:46.798 --> 37:48.600
EDDIE:
These, uh...

37:48.634 --> 37:51.303
There was a settlement,
and these files were sealed.

37:51.337 --> 37:53.739
Oh. Well, your seal
just sprung a leak.

37:53.772 --> 37:57.309
That's the exact thing
that will sour your reputation

37:57.343 --> 37:58.610
with Empire's board.

37:58.644 --> 38:00.178
Oh, hell, any board.

38:02.614 --> 38:04.115
Remember these?

38:04.149 --> 38:07.686
Those are those same papers
I offered you the other day,

38:07.719 --> 38:11.122
just the severance package
was carved out of it.

38:11.156 --> 38:13.459
COOKIE: If you don't want the
truth to come out about this,

38:13.492 --> 38:16.662
then I suggest
you sign this contract,

38:16.695 --> 38:19.698
and then stay the hell away
from Empire.

38:24.370 --> 38:26.805
Like I said...

38:26.838 --> 38:29.741
can't say no to Cookie.

38:38.517 --> 38:40.486
Can I get my jacket, please?

38:40.519 --> 38:42.220
Thank you.

38:44.890 --> 38:46.558
(door buzzes)

38:55.000 --> 38:57.936
(cell door clanking)

39:00.205 --> 39:03.642
(scoffs)
You ain't even got a ring.

39:03.675 --> 39:06.044
(laughs)

39:06.077 --> 39:08.714
So you walked out on us
for some zero

39:08.747 --> 39:11.049
that was eventually
gonna dump your ass anyway.

39:11.082 --> 39:15.120
Yeah. I guess it beats
being a mother and a wife.

39:16.855 --> 39:19.257
So, how are your boys holding up
through all of this?

39:19.290 --> 39:21.026
Uh... you never worried
about us,

39:21.059 --> 39:22.561
so don't worry about my babies.

39:22.594 --> 39:25.764
I have to, given the devil
you left them with.

39:25.797 --> 39:27.499
Any man that would... that would
sacrifice his woman...

39:27.533 --> 39:29.835
-No, no, no, no, no, no.
-...to save his own ass ain't

39:29.868 --> 39:31.603
-Don't come up in...
-nothing but a son of a bitch.

39:31.637 --> 39:33.939
Don't come up in here
talking trash about my husband.

39:33.972 --> 39:36.408
Your husband?
(scoffs) Your sisters told me

39:36.442 --> 39:38.444
that weak ass served you
divorce papers.

39:38.477 --> 39:40.612
You know what a weak ass is?

39:40.646 --> 39:43.949
The weakest person you can be
is a mother who abandons

39:43.982 --> 39:46.051
-her three daughters.
-You...

39:46.084 --> 39:47.519
You chose to protect

39:47.553 --> 39:49.721
that high yellow trash
over your boys.

39:49.755 --> 39:51.389
-What?
-You know what? You are right.

39:51.423 --> 39:53.124
-We are not the same.
-Yeah, we are not.

39:53.158 --> 39:54.760
-We're not the same. I tried.
-We are nothing alike.

39:54.793 --> 39:55.961
I'm more like my father.

39:55.994 --> 39:57.863
You know what?
You're killing Jamal,

39:57.896 --> 39:59.965
-Hakeem, you're killing Andre.
-I need you to shut up.

39:59.998 --> 40:01.733
-Why are you doing it? Why?
-I need you to shut...

40:01.767 --> 40:05.336
Shut up!
Shut your ass up!

40:07.172 --> 40:09.975
So you think
what you did was hard,

40:10.008 --> 40:13.812
and you think this is easy?!
Huh?!

40:13.845 --> 40:17.115
I know what it's like
not to have your kids.

40:17.148 --> 40:20.552
It's a hole in your life,
Loretha.

40:20.586 --> 40:23.421
And you know what it's like
to grow up without a mother.

40:23.455 --> 40:25.957
You don't want that
for your boys.

40:25.991 --> 40:29.227
If there is anything,
anything you can do,

40:29.260 --> 40:33.431
or some deal you can cut
to get home, just do it.

40:33.465 --> 40:35.934
Don't let some man
keep you from your children

40:35.967 --> 40:38.136
-the way your daddy did to me.
-You don't get

40:38.169 --> 40:39.571
-to try to be my mother now.
-Listen.

40:39.605 --> 40:42.173
It's too late.
You know what?

40:42.207 --> 40:44.175
Ju... Don't come back here.

40:44.209 --> 40:46.111
I don't ever want
to see you again.

40:46.144 --> 40:49.014
Wait, wait. Don't you give up.
Don't give up, Loretha.

40:49.047 --> 40:51.182
I never did.
I never will!

40:51.216 --> 40:52.718
You remember!

40:56.387 --> 40:58.389
(door closes)

41:02.994 --> 41:04.930
POUNDCAKE:
Hey, you.

41:04.963 --> 41:06.464
I didn't mean to wake you.

41:06.498 --> 41:09.434
Nah, it's okay.

41:09.467 --> 41:11.136
Did you find her?

41:14.305 --> 41:15.874
I'm sorry.

41:15.907 --> 41:18.443
(crying softly)

41:18.476 --> 41:20.178
I knew it.

41:20.211 --> 41:22.047
I'm gonna keep looking
for her, okay?

41:22.080 --> 41:25.050
-Poundcake, I promise.
-I'm never gonna be able

41:25.083 --> 41:28.319
-to tell her that I love her.
-No, no, no. Hush.

41:28.353 --> 41:30.956
What would you like
to say to her? Huh?

41:30.989 --> 41:33.892
Cookie, no, I don't...
I don't know.

41:33.925 --> 41:35.894
Cook, I don't talk well.

41:35.927 --> 41:38.029
-I don't got...
-Okay. All right, all right.

41:38.063 --> 41:39.164
Okay, well...

41:42.568 --> 41:46.204
Tell me what you want to say.
I'll write it down.

41:46.237 --> 41:48.073
I'll help you, okay?

41:48.106 --> 41:51.342
So that you can
read it to her yourself.

41:51.376 --> 41:52.410
POUNDCAKE:
Mm.

41:56.081 --> 41:58.717
To my baby girl.

41:58.750 --> 42:01.753
I want you to know some things,

42:01.787 --> 42:05.023
so I'm gonna make a list.

42:08.026 --> 42:10.095
I invited you here
because we both know

42:10.128 --> 42:13.264
what it's like to be pulled
into the Lyon family,

42:13.298 --> 42:15.366
only to realize too late

42:15.400 --> 42:18.069
that they devour their own.

42:18.103 --> 42:20.105
Cigar?

42:24.943 --> 42:28.513
(chuckles)
Cut the big speech, Eddie.

42:28.546 --> 42:31.416
I'm here because there's
a clause in my custody agreement

42:31.449 --> 42:35.220
that gives me control over
Bella's stake in the Empire.

42:35.253 --> 42:39.124
And you are here
because you want my help

42:39.157 --> 42:42.093
stealing the company
from the Lyons.

42:43.962 --> 42:45.697
Well, I'm happy to join you,

42:45.731 --> 42:48.399
but I have one condition.

42:48.433 --> 42:51.970
Once we do...

42:52.003 --> 42:55.173
I'm gonna be CEO.

42:57.142 --> 43:00.378
I'm starting to get
what all the fuss is about you.

43:00.411 --> 43:02.313
(laughs):
Oh.

43:02.347 --> 43:04.215
Don't look at me
like that, Eddie.

43:04.249 --> 43:06.618
This is just business.

43:06.652 --> 43:09.788
And I'm not interested in being
Mrs. Barker Number Four.

43:09.821 --> 43:12.423
You dig?

43:12.457 --> 43:14.092
Of course.

43:14.125 --> 43:16.261
So let's order my favorite rosé

43:16.294 --> 43:19.898
and, uh, talk strategy.

43:19.931 --> 43:21.933
Shall we?

43:21.967 --> 43:23.869
Let's.

44:03.541 --> 44:04.676
Yeah.

44:04.710 --> 44:06.678
Captioned by
Media Access Group at WGBH

44:09.080 --> 44:11.149

44:30.869 --> 44:34.172

She's incredible.
She's my daughter Corinne.

44:34.205 --> 44:37.342
Finally, someone
