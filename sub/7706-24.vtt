WEBVTT

00:01.936 --> 00:05.337
Three hundred dollars
in phone calls?

00:05.339 --> 00:07.740
Sorry. I've been bored.

00:09.043 --> 00:12.611
Half of these phone calls
are to the phone in Lynn's room.

00:13.948 --> 00:15.614
I've been lazy too.

00:17.785 --> 00:21.420
You federal expressed
a letter to Brian?

00:22.690 --> 00:25.924
It absolutely, positively
had to be there.

00:27.328 --> 00:28.560
[knock on door]

00:28.562 --> 00:30.729
(Trevor)
'Hey, Tanners. It's us!'

00:32.400 --> 00:34.400
ALF...kitchen.

00:34.402 --> 00:37.369
No problem.
I'll call a cab.

00:37.371 --> 00:39.705
You'll walk! Now!

00:40.741 --> 00:43.409
One day, I'll walk
into that kitchen

00:43.411 --> 00:45.644
and keep right on walking.

00:45.646 --> 00:47.012
Oh!

00:47.014 --> 00:48.547
(ALF)
'Ow!'

00:52.720 --> 00:54.520
- Hi, Trevor, Raquel.
- Willie.

00:54.522 --> 00:56.021
- Hi.
- What's up?

00:56.023 --> 00:58.223
Tomorrow night
we're having a surprise party

00:58.225 --> 00:59.558
for our nephew, Jake.

00:59.560 --> 01:01.226
To celebrate his passing
the eighth grade

01:01.228 --> 01:03.028
after only one year.

01:03.030 --> 01:05.297
He's so smart, it's scary.

01:06.867 --> 01:09.268
A $300 phone bill?

01:09.270 --> 01:12.571
Yes, Raquel,
that's our phone bill.

01:12.573 --> 01:16.175
Most of those calls are
to your daughter's phone number.

01:16.177 --> 01:17.943
We're a close family.

01:19.513 --> 01:21.814
So what's your
<i> repondez, s'il vous plait?</i>

01:23.451 --> 01:25.918
- I'm sure we can all be there.
- Terrific.

01:25.920 --> 01:28.587
The party begins at 8:00,
we'll break the<i> pinata</i> at 9:00.

01:28.589 --> 01:30.322
- See you then.
- Toodles.

01:34.528 --> 01:36.795
A<i> pinata!</i> A<i> pinata!</i>

01:36.797 --> 01:38.797
Let me at it!

01:38.799 --> 01:42.267
Oh, ALF, you know
you have to stay here.

01:42.269 --> 01:43.602
Great!

01:43.604 --> 01:47.506
A party where stuff gets broken
and I can't go!

01:48.776 --> 01:51.810

[instrumental music]

02:57.845 --> 02:58.877
Oh, hi, ALF.

02:58.879 --> 03:01.613
Hey, didn't you see
the sign on the door?

03:03.551 --> 03:07.152
"Genius at work."

03:07.154 --> 03:08.687
I'm sorry.

03:08.689 --> 03:10.689
I didn't make the connection.

03:10.691 --> 03:11.957
- Aah.
- Yeah, yeah.

03:11.959 --> 03:15.327
Hey, as long as you're here,
check this out.

03:15.329 --> 03:16.695
"Do not be afraid.

03:16.697 --> 03:20.165
"I'm a superior being
from the planet Melmac.

03:20.167 --> 03:24.069
And even on Melmac, I was
considered above average."

03:25.839 --> 03:29.208
Of course, they did
grade on a curve.

03:29.210 --> 03:30.742
Read on.

03:32.046 --> 03:34.213
"I'm not a God.

03:34.215 --> 03:35.914
"There is no reason to kneel.

03:37.418 --> 03:39.618
Okay, if you insist."

03:41.488 --> 03:43.455
Works for me. You?

03:44.925 --> 03:48.961
I assume this is more
than a typing lesson.

03:50.331 --> 03:52.898
It's my press release.

03:52.900 --> 03:56.935
I've decided to reveal
myself to the world.

03:56.937 --> 03:59.004
This way I can meet new people.

03:59.006 --> 04:02.474
Travel.
See a Grateful Dead concert.

04:04.278 --> 04:07.746
I don't think the authorities
would even let you out in public

04:07.748 --> 04:10.015
much less become a deadhead.

04:10.017 --> 04:13.051
You'd become
government property.

04:13.053 --> 04:16.154
That's fine,
as long as I've got my freedom.

04:17.791 --> 04:19.524
Don't you understand?

04:19.526 --> 04:22.561
You'll have no freedom.

04:22.563 --> 04:24.796
What are you saying?
I'd have no freedom?

04:26.066 --> 04:27.432
Yes!

04:27.434 --> 04:28.967
Think about it, ALF.

04:28.969 --> 04:32.704
You'd-you'd become a specimen
on a shelf.

04:32.706 --> 04:35.140
You'd be alone in a lab.

04:35.142 --> 04:40.479
<i> Doomed to spend each</i>
<i> and every day in isolation.</i>

04:40.481 --> 04:43.849
Look at this.
They've got me wired for cable.

04:46.120 --> 04:47.786
Let's see.

04:47.788 --> 04:50.188
Which was the button
for a cheeseburger?

04:51.458 --> 04:53.158
Uh..

04:54.395 --> 04:56.395
[electricity crackling]
Aah!

04:56.397 --> 04:59.131
Oh, that's not it!

04:59.133 --> 05:00.565
Uh..

05:02.670 --> 05:04.970
[electricity crackling]
Aah!

05:04.972 --> 05:07.572
Oh, I've got to label
these buttons.

05:12.513 --> 05:17.716
Great. I wiped out half my
childhood memories for celery!

05:22.256 --> 05:24.356
Hey, you! Come here.

05:24.358 --> 05:25.657
Yes?

05:25.659 --> 05:29.294
How did you get out
of your cage?

05:29.296 --> 05:31.029
I work here.

05:31.031 --> 05:32.331
Sorry.

05:32.333 --> 05:33.999
Uh, look

05:34.001 --> 05:37.002
I'll give you five bucks if
you'll let me out of this cage.

05:37.004 --> 05:40.339
Ten, if you clean it
while I'm out.

05:40.341 --> 05:42.174
Can't do it.

05:42.176 --> 05:43.809
Please.

05:43.811 --> 05:45.510
Look, I-I've got
to get out of here.

05:45.512 --> 05:48.347
I've got a family.
I've got a life.

05:48.349 --> 05:50.982
I've got a cake in the oven!

05:50.984 --> 05:52.317
I guess you should've thought
about that

05:52.319 --> 05:55.220
before you exposed yourself
to the world

05:55.222 --> 05:57.956
Specimen A-L-F/1.

05:59.026 --> 06:02.728
I'm not a specimen.
I'm a spaceman.

06:02.730 --> 06:05.097
Get the teeth fixed, Boris.

06:06.367 --> 06:07.766
[ALF sighs]

06:09.703 --> 06:12.003
[electricity crackling]

06:12.005 --> 06:14.773
Well, I guess there's still
no word from the governor.

06:16.910 --> 06:20.612
Well, you're living in the
Dark Ages, Willie or<i> won't he?</i>

06:21.582 --> 06:23.915
Alright, what do you think
would happen

06:23.917 --> 06:26.551
if you went public
with this?

06:26.553 --> 06:29.354
If I revealed myself
to the world

06:29.356 --> 06:31.923
I could become...a star.

06:31.925 --> 06:34.393
- Could not.
- Could too.

06:34.395 --> 06:37.596
I might even get
my own TV show.

06:37.598 --> 06:41.066
A poignant drama
about my generation.

06:41.068 --> 06:44.403
We'll call it "230 something."

06:47.541 --> 06:49.508
Keep dreaming.

06:49.510 --> 06:51.343
It's not a dream, Willie.

06:51.345 --> 06:53.278
This could really happen.

06:53.280 --> 06:57.416
Hey, maybe I'll host a talk show
like David Letterman.

06:57.418 --> 06:59.985
I have a gap between my teeth.

07:01.922 --> 07:04.756
[audience cheering]

07:04.758 --> 07:09.294
My, oh, my.
We're having some fun tonight.

07:09.296 --> 07:12.697
Later on "Stupid Pet Tricks,"
you'll see a cat

07:12.699 --> 07:15.434
do a 50 foot dive into my mouth.

07:15.436 --> 07:17.536
[laughs]

07:17.538 --> 07:19.171
[glass shatters]

07:20.574 --> 07:22.073
Oh, I almost forgot.

07:22.075 --> 07:24.476
Say hello to Willie Tanner,
ladies and gentlemen.

07:24.478 --> 07:27.212
[applauding]

07:28.248 --> 07:29.948
Hi, babe.

07:29.950 --> 07:32.284
I want to thank you
for bringing me on board

07:32.286 --> 07:34.686
after you fired Paul Shaffer.

07:36.457 --> 07:38.123
Oh, you're welcome.

07:38.125 --> 07:43.295
Willie boy, he does it all,
including my laundry. Ha! Ha!

07:46.099 --> 07:51.870
May I say, you are the best
dressed dude in the biz.

07:54.741 --> 07:56.741
Yes, you may.

07:56.743 --> 07:58.577
[glass shattering]

07:58.579 --> 08:01.413
Let's bring out
my first guest

08:01.415 --> 08:03.648
Ms. Sandy Dunkin.

08:03.650 --> 08:04.816
[audience applauding]

08:14.528 --> 08:16.795
[kissing]

08:16.797 --> 08:18.930
- Hey, nice outfit.
- Thanks.

08:18.932 --> 08:21.733
You buy anything else
at Sher's garage sale?

08:23.604 --> 08:26.505
Ha ha. Just kidding.

08:26.507 --> 08:28.139
What have you been up to?

08:28.141 --> 08:29.674
Um, well..

08:29.676 --> 08:33.879
I've been doing a new series
called "Valerie's Family."

08:33.881 --> 08:35.947
Ah, "Valerie's Family."

08:35.949 --> 08:37.782
That's the one where
they killed off the mother

08:37.784 --> 08:39.518
to give you her job, right?

08:40.954 --> 08:43.889
No, no, no. That's not
actually what happened.

08:43.891 --> 08:45.891
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
That's your story.

08:45.893 --> 08:47.692
No, no, no. Really, it wa..
Forget it.

08:47.694 --> 08:50.996
Um, ALF, it's-it's good
to be here with you.

08:50.998 --> 08:54.866
I haven't done the show
since you got rid of David.

08:54.868 --> 08:57.469
Well, I didn't at least
kill him to get the job.

08:59.206 --> 09:03.842
You know the longer I sit here,
the more I miss David.

09:03.844 --> 09:07.379
Take elevator five
he's running that now.

09:07.381 --> 09:10.916
We'll be right back after
this word from our sponsor.

09:10.918 --> 09:12.918
Maybe you will be.

09:14.221 --> 09:17.822
Ha ha ha ha ha ha.

09:17.824 --> 09:19.925
What?

09:19.927 --> 09:22.861
You've got
a vivid imagination, ALF.

09:22.863 --> 09:26.264
And a surprisingly
big ego, babe.

09:27.734 --> 09:31.503
You're dangerously close to
losing the bandleader gig, man.

09:33.574 --> 09:36.007
I don't wanna be
a bandleader.

09:36.009 --> 09:40.278
I just want you to think
before you do something stupid.

09:40.280 --> 09:43.715
Would inviting ten newspapers
to a press conference

09:43.717 --> 09:45.951
be considered stupid?

09:45.953 --> 09:48.820
- Yes!
- Then you're too late.

09:50.090 --> 09:53.091
You called ten newspapers?

09:53.093 --> 09:56.027
And a couple of TV stations.

09:56.029 --> 09:58.530
Tomorrow at 1:00 p.m.

09:58.532 --> 10:03.268
I shall expose myself
to the world.

10:03.270 --> 10:04.936
No.

10:04.938 --> 10:06.137
You're right.

10:06.139 --> 10:08.607
Maybe I should
put on some pants.

10:14.114 --> 10:15.847
[instrumental music]

10:19.119 --> 10:21.052
No reporters yet.

10:21.054 --> 10:22.587
I can't believe it.

10:22.589 --> 10:26.324
This is the worst thing
that ALF has ever done.

10:26.326 --> 10:27.826
Maybe the reporters
won't even come.

10:27.828 --> 10:29.961
Maybe they thought
ALF was a crank.

10:29.963 --> 10:32.464
Well, at least one
reporter is coming.

10:32.466 --> 10:34.132
I promised him whiskey.

10:35.469 --> 10:38.403
Why are you dressed
in that getup?

10:38.405 --> 10:39.971
Showmanship, babe.

10:39.973 --> 10:41.473
- ALF..
- Hey.

10:41.475 --> 10:44.376
My real space suit
looks like a hefty bag.

10:45.779 --> 10:48.179
Look, I just wanna be free.

10:49.016 --> 10:51.583
As free as the wind blows.

10:51.585 --> 10:54.085
As free as the grass grows.

10:54.087 --> 10:58.256
Born free to follow my heart.

10:58.258 --> 11:03.094
ALF, we understand how you feel,
but you've got to realize--

11:03.096 --> 11:06.831
Live free
as beauty surrounds me.

11:06.833 --> 11:09.401
The world still astounds me.

11:11.772 --> 11:13.038
Hi, dad.

11:13.040 --> 11:14.973
- Did you get it?
- Yeah.

11:14.975 --> 11:17.509
ALF, I've got something for you.

11:17.511 --> 11:21.780
- Oh, a coming-out present!
- Not exactly.

11:21.782 --> 11:24.249
A videotape. Alright!

11:26.353 --> 11:29.954
Wait a minute.
This is a documentary.

11:29.956 --> 11:32.257
Just the antidote
for my boredom.

11:33.794 --> 11:36.728
I want you to watch this, ALF.

11:36.730 --> 11:38.496
What's that?

11:38.498 --> 11:40.298
It's a Ugandan orangutan.

11:40.300 --> 11:42.701
What's he throwing
at the camera?

11:43.637 --> 11:45.403
Never mind.

11:45.405 --> 11:48.640
Here, this is the part
I want you to watch.

11:48.642 --> 11:51.342
(man on TV)
'The Ugandan orangutan
had become extinct'

11:51.344 --> 11:53.511
'except for this last
remaining male'

11:53.513 --> 11:55.980
'as there were no females
with which to breed.'

11:55.982 --> 11:57.649
I know the feeling.

11:58.985 --> 12:01.052
'This last Ugandan orangutan'

12:01.054 --> 12:03.221
'was ultimately
captured and isolated'

12:03.223 --> 12:05.323
'until its death last year.'

12:05.325 --> 12:09.094
'Scientists speculate the
animal died of loneliness.'

12:10.864 --> 12:12.530
That was nice.

12:12.532 --> 12:15.433
Oh, I think I hear
the reporter coming.

12:16.903 --> 12:19.003
ALF, don't you understand?

12:19.005 --> 12:22.373
You could end up
just like that poor animal.

12:22.375 --> 12:25.677
That won't happen to me.
I'm one of a kind.

12:27.013 --> 12:28.880
So was the orangutan.

12:28.882 --> 12:31.249
All that proves
is that orangutans

12:31.251 --> 12:34.018
don't live well in captivity.

12:34.020 --> 12:36.454
Do aliens?

12:36.456 --> 12:37.922
I don't know.

12:37.924 --> 12:41.359
I've never been captivated.

12:41.795 --> 12:43.561
Not yet.

12:43.563 --> 12:45.063
[gasps]

12:45.065 --> 12:46.765
[doorbell dings]

12:46.767 --> 12:49.300
Blimey, what have I done?

12:49.302 --> 12:51.069
Hide me! Hide me! Hide me!

12:51.071 --> 12:52.237
Where are you going?

12:52.239 --> 12:53.404
I wanna be alone.

12:53.406 --> 12:56.141
Come on, Brian, keep me company.

12:59.980 --> 13:01.279
Hello.

13:01.281 --> 13:04.082
I'm here for the media event
of the century.

13:04.084 --> 13:05.817
It's been canceled.

13:05.819 --> 13:08.086
Whiskey been canceled too?

13:08.088 --> 13:10.355
- Yes.
- Figures.

13:13.960 --> 13:15.794
ALF, are you alright?

13:17.430 --> 13:18.830
Yeah.

13:18.832 --> 13:21.166
But if Robin Leach calls back

13:21.168 --> 13:24.202
just say, "ALF who?"

13:25.572 --> 13:26.805
[sighs]

13:36.650 --> 13:38.216
ALF?

13:39.853 --> 13:41.352
[yawning]

13:43.957 --> 13:46.057
Welcome to ALF-catraz.

13:47.260 --> 13:48.827
How was the party tonight?

13:49.996 --> 13:53.665
Oh, it was okay, I guess.

13:53.667 --> 13:55.834
Jake broke the<i> pinata.</i>

13:55.836 --> 14:00.271
Trevor bruised a couple
of ribs diving for the candy.

14:01.708 --> 14:03.274
ALF..

14:04.144 --> 14:06.678
...what are you doing?

14:06.680 --> 14:09.948
When Melmacians try
to drown our sorrows

14:09.950 --> 14:13.518
we gravitate towards
cheap imitation porcelain.

14:16.323 --> 14:18.356
I'll have you know,
this is expensive

14:19.025 --> 14:21.426
imitation porcelain.

14:22.195 --> 14:24.195
We also eat more.

14:25.031 --> 14:27.866
How is that possible?

14:27.868 --> 14:31.803
Well, our spare stomachs
open up.

14:31.805 --> 14:36.374
By the way, don't bother looking
for your laxative on a rope.

14:38.178 --> 14:41.079
Oh, you mean my soap on a rope?

14:41.081 --> 14:43.147
Trust me on this one.

14:46.920 --> 14:48.586
Here you go, ALF.

14:48.588 --> 14:51.789
Oh, wow,
you really are depressed.

14:54.027 --> 14:56.728
I need something
to wash this down.

14:56.730 --> 14:58.229
Got any ketchup?

14:58.231 --> 15:00.198
Coming right up.

15:00.200 --> 15:01.733
Dad, we've got to do
something about this.

15:01.735 --> 15:03.268
You're right.

15:03.270 --> 15:06.337
You may not want
to watch this, Willie.

15:06.339 --> 15:08.673
Oh, I've seen you
eat before, ALF.

15:08.675 --> 15:10.642
[chomping]

15:22.122 --> 15:24.422
(Kate)
'Get out of this bathroom!'

15:24.424 --> 15:27.058
'I am going to take a bath,
and that's final.'

15:27.060 --> 15:28.459
[door closes]

15:28.461 --> 15:32.230
(ALF)
'Fine! I'll go sulk
in the kids' bathroom.'

15:32.232 --> 15:33.698
Um, before you do that, ALF

15:33.700 --> 15:35.800
could you come out here
for a moment?

15:35.802 --> 15:37.769
Sure, why not?

15:37.771 --> 15:41.606
It's not like I was born free
to follow my heart or anything.

15:44.811 --> 15:46.945
(all)
Surprise!

15:46.947 --> 15:49.614
Willie, intruder alert!

15:49.616 --> 15:53.051
I've been seen by
a vicious snarling mob.

15:53.053 --> 15:56.321
[indistinct chatter]

15:56.323 --> 15:59.524
Hey, hey, wait a minute.
I know this mob.

16:00.727 --> 16:03.728
We've invited everyone
who's ever met you.

16:03.730 --> 16:05.063
Were you surprised?

16:05.065 --> 16:07.265
Heck no. I knew it all along.

16:07.267 --> 16:08.499
[murmuring]

16:08.501 --> 16:10.635
I guess, you are shaking
'cause you are cold.

16:10.637 --> 16:14.172
Hey, I just got out of the tub.

16:14.174 --> 16:15.974
How's it going Jake-o'-lantern?

16:15.976 --> 16:17.141
Great, give me five!

16:17.143 --> 16:19.944
Here's four. I owe you one!
Ha! Ha!

16:19.946 --> 16:22.747
- How you doing, ALF?
- Larry, my shrink!

16:22.749 --> 16:26.317
Hey, nice to see you
when I'm not wacko.

16:26.319 --> 16:28.219
I challenge that.

16:29.089 --> 16:31.289
Grandma Dorothy.

16:31.291 --> 16:34.258
How's your much
younger husband, Wizzer?

16:35.829 --> 16:37.862
Always a pleasure.

16:37.864 --> 16:39.530
Look, ALF, Jody's here.

16:39.532 --> 16:42.967
"Citizen Kane!" Yeah!
Nice to see you.

16:42.969 --> 16:44.502
Nice not to see you.

16:44.504 --> 16:46.938
Ha! Ha! What a kidder!

16:46.940 --> 16:50.108
- Hey, watch out for the lamp!
- Oh.

16:50.110 --> 16:52.343
ALF, we wanted
to show you that

16:52.345 --> 16:55.513
your world isn't as
limited as you thought.

16:55.515 --> 16:57.281
We know it's not
the same as going out

16:57.283 --> 17:00.184
and making new friends,
but we hope it helps.

17:00.186 --> 17:03.388
I couldn't ask for more.

17:03.390 --> 17:04.655
Where are the presents?

17:04.657 --> 17:07.358
- 'Oh!'
- Presents?

17:07.360 --> 17:09.027
Presents?
We gave you presents

17:09.029 --> 17:14.699
at Christmas and at your
birthday and on St. Melmac's Day

17:14.701 --> 17:18.236
which I really doubt was
all that big a holiday anyway.

17:18.238 --> 17:21.205
Hey, forget the presents.

17:21.207 --> 17:24.475
I guess it's enough
that my friends

17:24.477 --> 17:27.278
and Dorothy are here.

17:28.748 --> 17:31.849
Surprise!

17:31.851 --> 17:33.551
Oh, boy!

17:33.553 --> 17:36.754
Friends with presents
are the best kind of friends

17:37.857 --> 17:39.891
and Dorothy.

17:39.893 --> 17:41.059
[laughing]

17:43.763 --> 17:46.230
(ALF)
'I'll open your
present next, Jody.'

17:46.232 --> 17:49.767
(Jody)
'Well, I'm just gonna have
to take your word for that.'

17:49.769 --> 17:51.502
[laughing]

17:51.504 --> 17:54.906
Oh, a sweater!

17:54.908 --> 17:56.374
Thank you, Jody.

17:56.376 --> 17:57.675
You're welcome, ALF.

17:57.677 --> 17:59.243
Now you can get
rid of that ratty one

17:59.245 --> 18:01.079
you're always wearing.

18:02.782 --> 18:05.349
I better start
using a conditioner.

18:06.753 --> 18:08.920
She thinks ALF's fur
is a sweater.

18:11.858 --> 18:14.358
I'm sorry, Larry,
didn't I warn you?

18:14.360 --> 18:17.762
Jody doesn't know
ALF's an alien.

18:17.764 --> 18:20.264
- Uh-oh.
- What?

18:20.266 --> 18:23.101
Well, I told her about the time
ALF ate your tennis racket

18:23.103 --> 18:26.003
because he thought
the strings were made of catgut.

18:28.942 --> 18:30.575
Hey, thanks, Dorothy.

18:30.577 --> 18:34.212
I always wanted to learn
how to play jai alai.

18:34.214 --> 18:36.881
It's a Dustbuster.

18:36.883 --> 18:38.549
I know that.

18:38.551 --> 18:40.885
I was being whimsical.

18:40.887 --> 18:42.653
I thought you could
get off your duff

18:42.655 --> 18:44.956
and do a little housework.

18:44.958 --> 18:47.258
You shouldn't have.

18:47.260 --> 18:49.127
I really mean it!

18:49.129 --> 18:51.129
ALF, I didn't have any money

18:51.131 --> 18:53.164
so I fixed the CD player
you broke.

18:53.166 --> 18:54.899
Oh, great!

18:54.901 --> 18:56.801
- Oh!
- 'ALF.'

18:56.803 --> 18:59.036
My birthday is in six months.

19:01.141 --> 19:03.941
Um, Brian come here.

19:03.943 --> 19:05.309
[indistinct whispering]

19:05.311 --> 19:08.012
Speech! Speech!

19:08.014 --> 19:10.114
[indistinct chattering]

19:10.116 --> 19:13.985
Well, unaccustomed as I am
to public speaking

19:13.987 --> 19:17.421
as there's very seldom
a public here to speak to

19:17.423 --> 19:19.423
I'll be brief.

19:19.425 --> 19:21.492
I wouldn't put money on that.

19:21.494 --> 19:22.693
Mom, shh.

19:22.695 --> 19:26.597
Actually, I just
wanted to say that

19:26.599 --> 19:29.634
I never realized
how good I have it.

19:29.636 --> 19:32.637
I don't need to go out
and make new friends.

19:32.639 --> 19:37.208
I already have the best friends
including Dorothy

19:37.210 --> 19:38.776
anyone could have.

19:39.979 --> 19:44.182
Oh, why, ALF, thank you.
Thank you very..

19:44.184 --> 19:46.684
¶ Dottie's gonna cry ¶¶

19:46.686 --> 19:48.786
Oh, stop it! I am not.

19:48.788 --> 19:50.988
[knock on door]
'Hey, Tanners! It's us.'

19:50.990 --> 19:53.824
Oh, no. It's Trevor.
Well, he wasn't invited.

19:53.826 --> 19:55.426
Yeah, that never stops him.

19:57.130 --> 20:01.199
I think just for a change
of pace, I'll..

20:03.703 --> 20:05.636
[chuckles]
...hide in the kitchen.

20:05.638 --> 20:08.506
Ha! I kill us.

20:08.508 --> 20:10.208
Well, why is ALF hiding?

20:10.210 --> 20:12.810
- Well, uh--
- He owes the Ochmoneks money.

20:14.147 --> 20:16.247
[sighs]
I thought you said
they were going out tonight.

20:16.249 --> 20:18.616
They always go
dancing on Saturdays.

20:20.553 --> 20:21.919
- Oh, hello.
- Hi.

20:21.921 --> 20:25.089
We were wondering
if you knew where Jake went?

20:25.091 --> 20:26.824
R-right here!

20:29.095 --> 20:31.896
Oh, you're having a party.

20:31.898 --> 20:33.397
How interesting.

20:33.399 --> 20:35.066
And we weren't invited?

20:35.068 --> 20:37.068
After having them over
last night!

20:37.070 --> 20:39.437
Now, now, Trevor,
I'm sure the Tanners

20:39.439 --> 20:41.839
had a very good reason
for stiffing us.

20:43.743 --> 20:47.545
Well, it's not a party party.

20:47.547 --> 20:51.015
It's a Tupperware party.

20:51.017 --> 20:54.919
Oh, you mean the party
where you have to buy stuff?

20:54.921 --> 20:55.886
Gotta dance!

20:55.888 --> 20:58.289
But I will have
a slab of that cake.

20:58.291 --> 21:00.391
I'll get a couple of plates.

21:00.393 --> 21:02.927
Thanks. Bring Raquel one too.

21:07.133 --> 21:08.933
I'm sorry for the interruption.

21:08.935 --> 21:10.701
No problem.

21:10.703 --> 21:13.638
I enjoy the challenge
of avoiding those two.

21:13.640 --> 21:16.007
- It keeps me young.
- Not me.

21:16.709 --> 21:18.609
Hey, Willie..

21:18.611 --> 21:21.112
...thanks for the party
and everything.

21:21.114 --> 21:23.714
It's nice to know
there's someone around

21:23.716 --> 21:26.284
to save me from myself.

21:26.286 --> 21:28.719
You're welcome, pal!

21:28.721 --> 21:30.621
(Raquel)
'Willie, I need a doggie bag.'

21:30.623 --> 21:32.290
(Kate)
'Raquel, don't go in there.'

21:32.292 --> 21:34.692
Ah, the game is afoot.

21:44.170 --> 21:46.971
[piano music]

21:54.147 --> 21:56.647
ALF, aren't you
having a good time?

21:56.649 --> 21:59.817
Yeah, I'm just sick
of Larry telling that story

21:59.819 --> 22:02.320
about me eating
the tennis racket.

22:02.322 --> 22:05.990
So, there he was with the handle
sticking out of his mouth!

22:05.992 --> 22:09.126
I can't believe I invited
them all back tomorrow.

22:09.128 --> 22:10.428
You what?

22:10.430 --> 22:13.864
They're my friends and Dorothy.

22:13.866 --> 22:17.835
Besides, I could use
the extra presents.

22:17.837 --> 22:19.170
(Larry)
Encore, encore.

22:19.172 --> 22:20.304
Willie, Willie

22:20.306 --> 22:22.139
do you know
"And The Band Played On?"

22:22.141 --> 22:24.275
Well, I sure do.

22:24.277 --> 22:26.110
Well, play it!

22:27.680 --> 22:29.880
[piano music]

22:29.882 --> 22:33.684
¶ Casey would waltz
with a strawberry blond ¶

22:33.686 --> 22:37.555
¶ And the band played on ¶

22:37.557 --> 22:41.859
¶ And on and on and on and on ¶

22:41.861 --> 22:45.363
¶ And on ¶
¶ And the band played on ¶

22:45.365 --> 22:49.233
¶ His brain was so loaded
it nearly exploded ¶

22:49.235 --> 22:53.003
¶ The poor girl would
shake with alarm ¶

22:53.005 --> 22:56.707
¶ He married the girl
with the strawberry curl ¶

22:56.709 --> 23:02.079
¶ And the band played on-n-n ¶¶
