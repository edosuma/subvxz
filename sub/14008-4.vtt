00:01.734 --> 00:02.566
Previously on Damages:

00:02.567 --> 00:04.196
My sister's coming from Oregon.

00:04.197 --> 00:05.362
Did something happen with Eddie?

00:05.363 --> 00:06.994
Yeah, he left me three weeks ago.

00:06.995 --> 00:08.592
Let me help. I'll write you a check.

00:08.593 --> 00:09.959
Thank you.

00:09.960 --> 00:11.989
Mom, I'd like you to meet Jill Burnham.

00:11.990 --> 00:13.552
Why are you dating a child?

00:13.553 --> 00:16.584
Michael, Jill is irresponsible
for letting you stay with her.

00:16.585 --> 00:20.282
You're not interested in college,
fine, but you don't live here anymore.

00:20.283 --> 00:22.815
Did you know my father was
sleeping with Danielle Marchetti?

00:22.816 --> 00:24.548
We can't let Patty Hewes subpoena her.

00:24.549 --> 00:26.081
We got to fly her out tonight.

00:26.082 --> 00:27.613
Something's wrong; her nose is bleeding.

00:27.614 --> 00:29.947
You put her on that
plane and she will die!

00:29.948 --> 00:31.446
What did the doctor say?

00:31.447 --> 00:32.146
You're good to go.

00:32.147 --> 00:33.980
They pulled Joe Tobin over.

00:33.981 --> 00:35.614
Danielle Marchetti was in the backseat.

00:35.615 --> 00:36.982
I always knew the Tobins
were hiding something.

00:36.983 --> 00:39.781
Now I know you're helping them do it.

01:00.250 --> 01:02.583
What's Danielle Marchetti's prognosis?

01:02.584 --> 01:05.016
She's out of the operating
room and in recovery.

01:05.018 --> 01:08.718
The doctor said another 15
minutes, she would've been dead.

01:08.719 --> 01:10.986
But the police believed Joe Tobin's story

01:10.987 --> 01:13.253
that he was on the way to the hospital.

01:13.254 --> 01:14.620
Well, that's bullshit.

01:14.621 --> 01:17.154
Joe wanted her on that
plane to protect his father.

01:17.155 --> 01:19.222
When will Danielle be able to talk?

01:19.223 --> 01:20.322
Could be a week.

01:20.323 --> 01:22.223
If there are no complications.

01:22.290 --> 01:23.490
That's too late.

01:23.491 --> 01:27.392
I want to get her on record
before Louis Tobin goes to prison.

01:27.393 --> 01:30.793
Do you think Gates might be
willing to delay sentencing?

01:30.794 --> 01:33.828
Call the D.A.'s office
now. Set up a meeting.

01:33.829 --> 01:36.996
See if he'll see me this morning.

01:39.064 --> 01:42.065
So, Shayes drowned?

01:42.133 --> 01:44.000
That's what the M.E. said.

01:44.001 --> 01:46.501
Lungs were filled with water.

01:46.569 --> 01:48.235
His body couldn't have
been in the water too

01:48.236 --> 01:49.970
long 'cause there's no bloating.

01:49.971 --> 01:54.005
Somebody must've pulled him
out, dragged him to the dumpster.

01:54.006 --> 01:55.906
Maybe.

01:55.940 --> 01:57.140
Someone smashes in

01:57.141 --> 02:01.809
Ms. Hewes' car, then her
law partner turns up dead.

02:01.877 --> 02:03.944
You think someone was targeting them both?

02:03.945 --> 02:05.611
What do you think, Milton?

02:05.612 --> 02:07.445
I think we should ask her.

02:07.446 --> 02:08.378
No, no.

02:08.380 --> 02:09.213
You're doing it again.

02:09.214 --> 02:12.114
You gotta handle these sort
of things more delicately.

02:12.115 --> 02:13.415
Sorry.

02:13.416 --> 02:14.249
No, it's okay.

02:14.250 --> 02:16.950
I mean, she doesn't even
know Shayes is dead yet.

02:16.951 --> 02:20.753
So, what do you want to do?

02:20.820 --> 02:22.720
We tell her.

02:27.704 --> 02:33.655
Corrected by chamallow35 www.addic7ed.com

03:15.163 --> 03:17.464
The conference room is just over here.

03:17.465 --> 03:18.665
Can we get you some coffee?

03:18.666 --> 03:21.066
No, thanks.

03:28.107 --> 03:29.406
Hey.

03:29.407 --> 03:30.606
Yeah?

03:30.607 --> 03:32.507
What's Patty doing here?

03:32.508 --> 03:35.177
We have a new witness in the Tobin case.

03:35.178 --> 03:36.945
Danielle Marchetti.

03:36.946 --> 03:39.747
She tried to contact me
and I missed her call.

03:39.748 --> 03:41.749
Now she's in the hospital.

03:43.018 --> 03:44.285
It could be a week

03:44.286 --> 03:46.553
before Danielle Marchetti's able to talk.

03:46.554 --> 03:47.721
So, we wait.

03:47.722 --> 03:50.690
The problem is Louis Tobin
is being sentenced tomorrow.

03:50.691 --> 03:53.292
I want a chance to confront
him with what we know about

03:53.293 --> 03:55.160
Ms. Marchetti before he goes to prison.

03:55.161 --> 03:56.829
You're asking me to delay his sentencing?

03:56.830 --> 03:57.729
Just for a week.

03:57.730 --> 04:00.798
This office is already taking shit
for not having the guy behind bars.

04:00.799 --> 04:04.333
House arrest is not exactly
appeasing the masses.

04:04.401 --> 04:05.134
The minute the judge

04:05.135 --> 04:07.570
sentences Tobin, he'll
have no incentive to talk.

04:07.571 --> 04:09.373
I want to get him on the record

04:09.374 --> 04:10.874
while we still have a chance.

04:10.875 --> 04:11.775
What makes you think

04:11.776 --> 04:15.212
Danielle Marchetti had
anything to do with the fraud?

04:15.280 --> 04:18.113
Louis Tobin called her on
Thanksgiving, the night he

04:18.115 --> 04:20.983
confessed to the Ponzi scheme.

04:21.051 --> 04:22.885
That's an interesting little detail.

04:22.886 --> 04:24.486
How long have you been sitting on that?

04:24.487 --> 04:26.087
I'm telling you now.

04:26.088 --> 04:27.989
Our offices are supposed
to be cooperating.

04:27.990 --> 04:29.858
Well, then let's cooperate.

04:29.859 --> 04:31.226
Delay his sentencing and we

04:31.227 --> 04:35.195
can both question him together.

04:35.263 --> 04:37.730
All right, Patty, but
I'm not giving you a week.

04:37.731 --> 04:39.632
You have one day.

04:39.700 --> 04:42.702
And if Tobin doesn't give us
anything, he is going to jail.

04:42.769 --> 04:47.140
See, now we're cooperating.

04:47.207 --> 04:53.412
Listen, Joe, they're going to
sentence your father this week.

04:53.480 --> 04:54.746
Do you understand that?

04:54.747 --> 04:56.714
This is it.

04:56.782 --> 04:57.882
They'll be sending him straight

04:57.883 --> 05:03.386
to prison for the rest of his life.

05:03.454 --> 05:05.122
He just wants to talk
to you before he goes.

05:05.123 --> 05:08.160
Lenny, no.

05:14.668 --> 05:19.836
Listen, Joe, at the house...

05:19.904 --> 05:24.440
Did I smell alcohol on your breath?

05:24.508 --> 05:25.507
I don't know, did you?

05:25.508 --> 05:27.710
Don't play games with me.

05:27.711 --> 05:31.079
We're in this together,
and I'm worried about you.

05:31.147 --> 05:32.847
I know your father is, too.

05:32.848 --> 05:37.118
When the time comes, he's gonna
contact us about the money, yes?

05:37.185 --> 05:38.652
Right.

05:38.653 --> 05:41.088
Good.

05:41.155 --> 05:43.957
There's nothing else I need from him.

05:44.024 --> 05:45.458
Where are you going?

05:45.459 --> 05:47.359
To be with my wife and son.

05:47.360 --> 05:52.430
Joe, tell me the truth.

05:52.497 --> 05:55.731
Do we need to get you back into a program?

06:01.569 --> 06:03.571
Thanks for helping me out.

06:03.572 --> 06:04.672
Seriously.

06:04.673 --> 06:07.074
I hate asking Mom for money.

06:07.141 --> 06:08.742
I know.

06:08.743 --> 06:11.443
It's just, you know, with
the baby and Eddie taking

06:11.444 --> 06:14.913
off on me, it just felt like
the walls were closing in.

06:14.980 --> 06:17.282
I didn't have a choice.

06:17.350 --> 06:19.250
I understand.

06:19.251 --> 06:21.919
It's, uh, it's a really
hard time for you right now.

06:21.920 --> 06:26.355
I mean, of course, I hate taking
money from you, too, but...

06:26.422 --> 06:30.824
Your check's really...
is really gonna help.

06:33.225 --> 06:35.226
I canceled it.

06:35.294 --> 06:38.562
Why?

06:38.630 --> 06:39.763
I have a baby, Ellen.

06:39.764 --> 06:41.834
I need that money.

06:41.902 --> 06:44.604
I saw the drugs.

06:44.672 --> 06:46.873
I honestly don't...

06:46.941 --> 06:49.676
I don't know what you're talking about.

06:49.677 --> 06:52.445
In your bag.

06:52.512 --> 06:54.580
When I went to borrow clothes upstairs.

06:54.581 --> 06:56.415
Well, that must've been Eddie's.

06:56.416 --> 06:59.421
You're telling me your husband walked
out on you, but left you his drugs.

06:59.422 --> 07:02.625
You don't believe me?

07:02.693 --> 07:04.827
I'm not doing drugs, Ellen.

07:04.895 --> 07:06.896
Carrie, just talk to me.

07:06.897 --> 07:08.464
I am, you're not listening.

07:08.465 --> 07:09.632
I want to help you.

07:09.633 --> 07:12.734
I do, but I need you to be honest with me.

07:12.735 --> 07:16.371
Oh, okay, so now I'm a liar.

07:16.439 --> 07:18.339
I swear, every time I think we

07:18.341 --> 07:21.443
might be friends, you
just humiliate me again.

07:21.444 --> 07:23.178
Carrie, wait.

07:23.179 --> 07:25.647
No, I'm done trying.

07:29.286 --> 07:30.687
How is Danielle?

07:30.688 --> 07:33.623
Well, the surgeon's optimistic.

07:33.624 --> 07:37.260
But she still has some
recovery time ahead of her.

07:37.261 --> 07:41.765
Thank you... for your help with this.

07:41.833 --> 07:44.334
We go back too far, Lou.

07:44.335 --> 07:46.103
You don't have to thank me.

07:46.104 --> 07:47.337
Hmm.

07:47.338 --> 07:50.640
You and Lenny.

07:50.708 --> 07:53.510
The only friends I've got left.

07:53.578 --> 07:56.413
I'll let you know her progress.

08:01.885 --> 08:04.685
Goddamn it, Lenny, what happened?

08:04.686 --> 08:06.586
How does Joe hit her with his car?

08:08.653 --> 08:09.684
He was upset.

08:09.685 --> 08:11.919
It was an accident.

08:15.289 --> 08:17.823
Was he drinking?

08:17.891 --> 08:19.124
'Cause this is exactly the kind

08:19.125 --> 08:23.128
of shit that happens when he does.

08:23.195 --> 08:25.163
You have to understand that his life has

08:25.164 --> 08:26.764
been turned upside down by this.

08:26.765 --> 08:28.499
And he can't handle it.

08:28.500 --> 08:31.835
He never could.

08:31.903 --> 08:34.303
I never should've told
him about the money.

08:34.304 --> 08:35.138
No, you had to.

08:35.139 --> 08:36.304
You had to.

08:36.306 --> 08:39.241
I mean, he was going to go to the press.

08:39.308 --> 08:41.443
You had to bring him on board.

08:41.510 --> 08:43.111
Can I rely on him anymore?

08:43.111 --> 08:45.346
I mean, is he going to
fall apart on me again?

08:45.347 --> 08:47.347
I don't know.

08:47.415 --> 08:49.516
Then bring him here.

08:49.583 --> 08:53.252
I need to look him in the eye.

08:53.319 --> 08:54.319
I already asked

08:54.320 --> 08:56.354
him to come.

08:56.422 --> 08:59.423
He won't.

09:02.394 --> 09:05.795
Then we'll have to
consider some other options.

09:08.365 --> 09:10.232
I understand.

09:10.233 --> 09:11.600
He's Louis Tobin's son.

09:11.601 --> 09:14.803
The whole world is watching.

09:14.871 --> 09:22.543
Mr. Winstone, it's in these kinds of
circumstances that we've made our reputation.

09:22.610 --> 09:26.146
In the past...

09:26.213 --> 09:31.350
when Joe's fallen off the wagon,
he's disappeared for weeks.

09:31.418 --> 09:38.890
His behavior gets... incredibly erratic.

09:38.957 --> 09:40.691
Right now we think he's

09:40.692 --> 09:43.060
staying with his in-laws upstate.

09:43.061 --> 09:45.762
His wife and child may be with him.

09:45.763 --> 09:48.264
He'll never know we're there.

09:48.331 --> 09:49.565
From now on, when we need to

09:49.566 --> 09:52.501
contact you, we'll use this.

09:52.568 --> 09:57.672
Can't be traced.

09:57.739 --> 10:01.908
If he drinks again...

10:01.976 --> 10:04.611
You know what to do.

10:09.482 --> 10:12.483
Hey, Mom.

10:15.787 --> 10:18.789
Hello, Michael.

10:26.264 --> 10:27.565
Well, I know we haven't spoken

10:27.566 --> 10:32.370
in months, but I wanted to
see you because Phil and I are

10:32.438 --> 10:36.709
finalizing our divorce, and I
thought you should know that.

10:36.776 --> 10:37.776
Yeah.

10:37.777 --> 10:38.777
He told me.

10:38.778 --> 10:40.712
I was very sorry to hear that.

10:40.780 --> 10:42.980
You're in contact with him?

10:42.981 --> 10:43.981
Absolutely.

10:43.982 --> 10:45.916
I didn't know that.

10:45.983 --> 10:48.919
He was a big help.

10:48.986 --> 10:50.320
With what?

10:50.321 --> 10:52.255
My job hunt.

10:52.323 --> 10:56.293
Finding one without a college
degree was pretty tough.

10:56.360 --> 10:58.194
I would think so.

10:58.195 --> 10:59.229
And you know me.

10:59.230 --> 11:02.499
What do I know about business
or economics or anything.

11:02.500 --> 11:04.434
So, Phil was great.

11:04.502 --> 11:08.071
He taught me about the stock market,
sent me in the right direction.

11:08.072 --> 11:10.306
- And you have a job?
- Yeah.

11:10.307 --> 11:12.809
I'm not an executive or
anything... it's entry level.

11:12.810 --> 11:14.310
But it's good.

11:14.311 --> 11:15.311
And it's a start.

11:15.312 --> 11:18.081
And it's something I did on my own.

11:18.082 --> 11:20.116
Well, I'm proud of you.

11:20.117 --> 11:23.052
I'm glad you're doing so well.

11:23.120 --> 11:25.054
Thanks, Mom.

11:25.122 --> 11:28.057
Means a lot.

11:28.124 --> 11:32.894
And, um... how is Jill?

11:32.962 --> 11:36.297
You were right about her.

11:36.298 --> 11:38.132
What do you mean?

11:38.133 --> 11:40.367
It was just a phase. It's over.

11:40.368 --> 11:41.869
Really?

11:41.870 --> 11:44.805
She seemed... lovely.

11:44.872 --> 11:46.373
She was great.

11:46.374 --> 11:49.376
But it just didn't work out.

11:51.713 --> 11:55.548
I should, uh, probably
get back to the office.

11:55.549 --> 11:57.483
So...

11:57.551 --> 11:59.552
Excuse me.

12:02.090 --> 12:05.094
No, I got it.

12:06.263 --> 12:08.202
Thank you, Michael.

12:08.270 --> 12:11.272
My pleasure.

12:13.442 --> 12:16.945
I'm sorry for your loss.

12:29.325 --> 12:30.926
Was it a homicide?

12:30.927 --> 12:33.395
Uh, we haven't been able to confirm that.

12:33.396 --> 12:35.397
Um...

12:35.465 --> 12:40.803
So, you and... and Mr. Shayes
were partners in the same law firm.

12:40.804 --> 12:42.305
Yes.

12:42.306 --> 12:50.247
Was, um, Mr. Shayes involved in any
particularly, uh, demanding, uh, cases?

12:50.314 --> 12:55.519
We were in the middle of the Tobin fraud.

12:55.587 --> 13:01.692
Did you, um, notice any
unusual behavior recently?

13:01.760 --> 13:06.764
The last time I spoke to him...

13:11.570 --> 13:14.605
something was wrong.

13:19.295 --> 13:20.795
Patty Hewes' office called.

13:20.796 --> 13:25.766
The D.A.'s offering to delay your sentencing
if you'll sit down and talk with them.

13:25.833 --> 13:27.001
Another deposition?

13:27.002 --> 13:29.036
No, it's just an interview.

13:29.037 --> 13:30.671
Less formal.

13:30.672 --> 13:35.040
I'm sure they want to ask
you questions about Danielle.

13:35.108 --> 13:37.276
What have you heard about Joe?

13:37.277 --> 13:40.278
He's still up with Rachel's parents.

13:40.279 --> 13:43.280
No real news.

13:45.283 --> 13:50.887
If I agree to talk, how long
will they delay my sentencing?

13:50.954 --> 13:54.523
I'm afraid it's just one day.

13:57.293 --> 14:00.227
Even so.

14:00.295 --> 14:03.229
One more day of freedom.

14:03.297 --> 14:05.397
Maybe Joe will change his mind.

14:05.465 --> 14:07.399
Come see me.

14:07.467 --> 14:10.501
So you'll talk with them?

14:12.504 --> 14:15.671
I actually think it's a good idea, Lou.

14:15.672 --> 14:17.606
Answer their questions.

14:17.673 --> 14:23.542
You're the only one who can put all
this Danielle Marchetti business to rest.

14:25.979 --> 14:29.915
Tell them I'll come in.

14:36.990 --> 14:39.926
Hi, sweetie.

14:39.994 --> 14:41.994
How was your appointment?

14:41.995 --> 14:43.996
It was good.

14:46.165 --> 14:48.332
- How's it going?
- I'm stuck.

14:48.333 --> 14:53.770
This canvas isn't giving
me the right bounce.

14:53.838 --> 14:56.773
Hmm.

14:56.841 --> 14:58.774
You'll get it.

14:58.842 --> 15:00.776
I got us a nice piece of fish.

15:00.844 --> 15:02.844
Great.

15:04.847 --> 15:06.780
I've been thinking.

15:06.848 --> 15:10.616
Maybe it's time for me to get a job.

15:10.684 --> 15:12.684
What about your painting?

15:12.685 --> 15:15.621
I don't know.

15:15.689 --> 15:17.824
De Kooning supported
himself as a housepainter

15:17.825 --> 15:19.959
when he first came to America.

15:19.960 --> 15:24.195
I don't think you're looking
at the next De Kooning.

15:26.098 --> 15:27.932
What did the doctor say?

15:27.933 --> 15:29.934
We're doing great.

15:32.137 --> 15:35.072
So, what's next?

15:35.140 --> 15:38.475
It's time for a 3-D ultrasound.

15:38.476 --> 15:40.376
Wow.

15:40.645 --> 15:42.813
- Got a minute?
- Sure.

15:42.814 --> 15:45.281
I'd like you to sit in on
the Louis Tobin interview.

15:45.282 --> 15:47.349
I thought Chris was
working with you on that.

15:47.350 --> 15:49.386
Chris screwed up with a witness.

15:49.387 --> 15:51.555
He needs to take backseat for a while.

15:51.556 --> 15:52.556
You in?

15:52.557 --> 15:54.391
Yeah, okay.

15:54.392 --> 15:56.327
Great.

15:56.394 --> 15:58.395
This isn't about Chris.

15:58.396 --> 16:00.330
I'm sorry?

16:00.398 --> 16:03.566
It's about Patty Hewes.
You don't trust her.

16:03.567 --> 16:06.002
You want me there to suss her out.

16:06.003 --> 16:08.671
I... I thought your point
of view might be useful.

16:08.672 --> 16:10.840
You should've just said so.

16:10.841 --> 16:14.277
I'd be happy to give you my insight.

16:21.785 --> 16:23.118
Your mom called.

16:23.119 --> 16:27.722
She wants you to see your
dad before he goes to prison.

16:27.790 --> 16:29.724
What did you say?

16:29.792 --> 16:34.395
I told her you didn't want to see him.

16:44.472 --> 16:48.708
Rach, he was having an affair.

16:50.710 --> 16:52.644
How do you know?

16:52.712 --> 16:55.714
He told me.

16:57.016 --> 17:01.953
It was with a woman I used to date.

17:02.021 --> 17:04.122
Her name's Danielle Marchetti.

17:04.190 --> 17:06.124
It was years before I met you.

17:06.191 --> 17:07.191
Jesus.

17:07.192 --> 17:11.628
And now he wants me
to say good-bye to him.

17:14.598 --> 17:17.534
I need you to understand...

17:17.602 --> 17:23.540
nothing is more important
to me than you and Kevin.

17:23.608 --> 17:27.044
It'll take some time, but...

17:27.111 --> 17:29.045
I'm going to make things right.

17:29.113 --> 17:32.048
I'm going to get our lives back.

17:32.116 --> 17:35.051
There's a way out of this.

17:35.119 --> 17:38.087
What are you talking about?

17:38.155 --> 17:45.661
Just... don't give up on me.

18:04.817 --> 18:09.816
There are visiting hours.

18:14.148 --> 18:16.148
What is it?

18:18.451 --> 18:21.453
Joe is drinking again.

18:24.457 --> 18:26.390
How do you know?

18:26.458 --> 18:29.393
Lenny.

18:29.461 --> 18:30.962
Why?

18:30.963 --> 18:32.897
He was doing so well.

18:32.965 --> 18:34.899
Why?

18:34.967 --> 18:37.634
Because he's my son. And he hates me.

18:37.635 --> 18:39.569
Always has.

18:39.636 --> 18:41.137
No.

18:41.138 --> 18:44.072
He always wanted your respect.

18:44.140 --> 18:48.143
The drinking, the dropping out of
college, everything he ever did.

18:48.144 --> 18:51.145
He was trying to get you to pay attention.

18:51.146 --> 18:52.813
He tried to explain it once.

18:52.814 --> 18:54.647
He was maybe 13, 14.

18:54.648 --> 18:57.984
I... I didn't understand at the time.

18:57.985 --> 19:02.821
But he said he... he
said he felt like a ghost.

19:06.258 --> 19:08.526
You never saw him, Lou.

19:08.594 --> 19:13.096
You never let him be his own man.

19:27.576 --> 19:29.476
I don't think so.

19:35.950 --> 19:38.885
Ah, you got me!

19:38.953 --> 19:41.854
Where are you? Kevin?

19:41.957 --> 19:43.791
- Kevin?!
- Down here, Daddy!

19:43.792 --> 19:45.193
I can't... Ah!

19:45.194 --> 19:47.528
So, why do you have
to go back to the city?

19:47.529 --> 19:49.762
I have some business to take care of.

19:49.763 --> 19:52.197
But I'll be back.

19:52.264 --> 19:56.232
I thought you didn't have a job anymore.

19:56.300 --> 19:57.966
I don't.

19:57.967 --> 19:59.999
But I still have some responsibilities.

20:00.000 --> 20:02.801
I want to try and fix
what your grandfather did.

20:02.802 --> 20:05.170
When did you know Grandpa was bad?

20:05.171 --> 20:06.171
What?

20:06.172 --> 20:08.106
What do you mean?

20:08.174 --> 20:10.108
Well, like, when you

20:10.176 --> 20:13.177
were a kid, did he always do bad things?

20:13.178 --> 20:16.013
Sometimes good people do bad things, Kev.

20:16.014 --> 20:17.781
Thanks.

20:17.782 --> 20:21.886
It's like when you misbehave...

20:21.954 --> 20:24.022
and Mom and I get angry at you.

20:24.089 --> 20:25.156
It's not 'cause you're bad.

20:25.157 --> 20:27.192
It's just, you did something wrong.

20:27.193 --> 20:28.393
We love you anyway.

20:28.394 --> 20:31.395
Do you love Grandpa?

20:34.999 --> 20:36.799
Yes. Absolutely.

20:36.800 --> 20:38.400
I love him.

20:38.401 --> 20:40.936
Everybody loved him.

20:41.004 --> 20:42.403
He was brilliant and funny.

20:42.404 --> 20:46.107
Everybody wanted to be like him.

20:46.175 --> 20:49.576
So, what happened?

20:49.644 --> 20:54.012
I'm not sure.

20:54.080 --> 20:56.346
I think he was just confused

20:56.414 --> 20:57.947
about what he wanted his life to

20:57.948 --> 21:01.282
be, so he made some terrible mistakes.

21:01.349 --> 21:03.249
Wow.

21:03.251 --> 21:04.751
Why?

21:04.752 --> 21:11.957
Well, maybe because even
though he had everything...

21:12.025 --> 21:14.426
he still felt bad about himself.

21:14.493 --> 21:16.427
And people who feel bad about

21:16.495 --> 21:20.364
themselves sometimes do bad things.

21:20.431 --> 21:22.832
Know what I mean?

21:22.900 --> 21:23.900
Yeah.

21:23.901 --> 21:26.069
Chicken.

21:26.070 --> 21:27.069
Wow.

21:27.070 --> 21:28.070
Chicken.

21:28.071 --> 21:29.971
Chicken.

21:31.141 --> 21:33.408
Don't throw that at the chicken.

21:33.409 --> 21:34.409
I won't.

21:34.410 --> 21:35.777
All right.

21:35.778 --> 21:38.146
He's still with his wife and kid.

21:38.147 --> 21:41.415
He left the property once to
pick up groceries, but that's it.

21:41.416 --> 21:42.416
And the drinking?

21:42.417 --> 21:45.019
Uh, he didn't buy any
alcohol in the store.

21:45.020 --> 21:48.054
Then on the way back, he
passed a bar, but didn't stop.

21:48.055 --> 21:49.488
Good.

21:49.489 --> 21:51.857
Of course, he's with his family now.

21:51.858 --> 21:54.825
The real test will be when
he gets back to the city.

21:54.826 --> 21:56.193
Okay.

21:56.194 --> 21:59.195
Thank you.

22:11.697 --> 22:12.831
Look familiar?

22:12.832 --> 22:15.167
Yes, except for that.

22:15.168 --> 22:16.735
Welcome back.

22:16.736 --> 22:17.736
A.D.A. Gates.

22:17.737 --> 22:18.737
Tom.

22:18.738 --> 22:19.738
Hi.

22:19.739 --> 22:20.739
Hey.

22:20.740 --> 22:23.007
We're ready for you
in the conference room.

22:23.008 --> 22:24.007
Great.

22:24.008 --> 22:25.007
Dig the new sign.

22:25.008 --> 22:28.008
I wanted a sexier font,
but what are you gonna do?

22:28.674 --> 22:30.741
How's Deb holding up?

22:30.742 --> 22:32.744
Well, she's hanging in there.

22:32.745 --> 22:35.312
I just really want to nail this asshole.

22:35.313 --> 22:36.347
Hmm.

22:36.348 --> 22:39.616
Mr. Tobin, you've met A.D.A. Curtis Gates.

22:39.617 --> 22:44.487
And this is my partner, Tom Shayes.

22:44.555 --> 22:48.692
Pleasure to meet you, Tom.

22:53.531 --> 22:58.234
I'd like to ask you
about Thanksgiving night.

22:58.302 --> 23:01.137
When you confessed to your family.

23:01.138 --> 23:02.404
Shortly after that confession,

23:02.405 --> 23:04.739
I'm correct... you made a phone call?

23:04.740 --> 23:05.907
Yes.

23:05.908 --> 23:08.676
I called Danielle Marchetti.

23:08.744 --> 23:12.912
What was the nature of your
relationship with Ms. Marchetti?

23:14.583 --> 23:17.318
It was an adult relationship.

23:17.319 --> 23:19.353
Were you sleeping with her?

23:19.354 --> 23:21.355
What is this, Oprah?

23:21.356 --> 23:22.790
It's okay.

23:22.791 --> 23:28.862
Danielle was simply a pathetic
old man's indiscretion.

23:28.929 --> 23:32.364
Why did you call her that night?

23:32.365 --> 23:34.032
Earlier that day, I

23:34.033 --> 23:40.737
had gone to Danielle's
apartment to say good-bye.

23:40.805 --> 23:46.175
It turned out that I...
left something behind.

23:46.243 --> 23:47.843
Marilyn, I...

23:47.844 --> 23:48.911
My chest. I...

23:48.912 --> 23:51.813
Where are your pills?

23:51.915 --> 23:52.915
Where are your pills?

23:52.916 --> 23:54.351
Where did you leave them?

23:54.352 --> 23:55.353
My pocket.

23:55.354 --> 23:56.354
My phone.

23:56.355 --> 23:57.589
Who should I call?

23:57.590 --> 23:58.591
No.

23:58.592 --> 24:00.390
No, give it to me.

24:00.391 --> 24:02.693
Are you calling Dr. Brandt?

24:02.694 --> 24:06.196
That'll take too long.

24:06.264 --> 24:07.264
I left my pills.

24:07.265 --> 24:09.833
Please bring them over.

24:09.901 --> 24:11.201
I don't care.

24:11.202 --> 24:14.536
Leave them in the lobby.

24:14.604 --> 24:16.304
Just do it, Danielle!

24:16.305 --> 24:18.306
Goddamn it, just do it.

24:22.912 --> 24:27.017
Danielle Marchetti?

24:28.953 --> 24:31.954
I'm sorry.

24:34.957 --> 24:41.396
So, the call you made to Ms. Marchetti
was simply to retrieve medication?

24:41.463 --> 24:42.497
Yes.

24:42.498 --> 24:44.465
I needed my pills.

24:44.533 --> 24:46.800
Danielle knew nothing of the fraud?

24:46.801 --> 24:48.701
Nothing.

24:48.703 --> 24:50.504
Then I'm confused.

24:50.505 --> 24:55.409
Why help her try to flee the country?

24:55.477 --> 25:01.214
My wife loved and trusted
me for almost 50 years.

25:01.281 --> 25:04.450
And in one night, she learned

25:04.518 --> 25:08.454
that I wasn't worthy of any of it.

25:08.455 --> 25:10.823
I asked Danielle to leave in

25:10.891 --> 25:17.030
order to avoid bringing
any more shame to my family.

25:17.097 --> 25:19.832
Well...

25:19.900 --> 25:22.902
I can certainly understand that.

25:32.078 --> 25:36.818
You honestly believe you're
gonna get away with this.

25:36.885 --> 25:38.720
Get away with what?

25:38.721 --> 25:40.788
I've already confessed
every crime I committed.

25:40.789 --> 25:44.491
You know, I imagine it
will entail highly complex

25:44.559 --> 25:46.860
money-laundering, secret disbursements.

25:46.861 --> 25:49.895
We agreed to the parameters
of this interview, Ms. Hewes.

25:49.896 --> 25:52.498
But when you're locked away,
who's gonna do it for you?

25:52.499 --> 25:54.501
You're not listening to me.

25:54.502 --> 25:56.504
Certainly not your attorney.

25:56.505 --> 25:57.838
Mr. Winstone may facilitate some

25:57.839 --> 26:00.073
things, but he's not blood.

26:00.141 --> 26:02.542
You'd never allow him
to step into your shoes.

26:02.543 --> 26:05.112
So, who then?

26:05.179 --> 26:07.214
Your
70-year-old wife?

26:07.281 --> 26:10.083
Your twice-divorced mess of a daughter?

26:10.084 --> 26:12.318
Ms. Hewes, you're making
a fool of yourself now.

26:12.319 --> 26:16.188
God forbid that you'd
leave it to your son.

26:16.255 --> 26:18.622
What about my son?

26:18.690 --> 26:22.326
I read an interview he once gave.

26:22.394 --> 26:23.828
You really want to trust the

26:23.829 --> 26:25.665
family fortune to a drunk?

26:25.666 --> 26:28.369
Okay, we're done here.

26:28.370 --> 26:31.372
Let's go, Louis.

26:34.709 --> 26:37.477
There is no fortune.

26:37.545 --> 26:40.980
I will find the money, Mr. Tobin.

26:40.981 --> 26:45.518
Last chance.

26:45.586 --> 26:50.256
Tell me where it is, and
I'll leave your family alone.

26:52.459 --> 26:54.359
There we go.

27:02.003 --> 27:04.037
What the hell was that?

27:04.038 --> 27:05.072
Tobin's been asked about that

27:05.073 --> 27:06.073
money a thousand times.

27:06.074 --> 27:07.307
Did Patty really think he was

27:07.308 --> 27:08.541
going to tell her something new?

27:08.542 --> 27:09.575
No, she knew Tobin

27:09.576 --> 27:11.810
wasn't going to tell her the truth.

27:11.811 --> 27:13.811
Well, then why interview him?

27:13.812 --> 27:15.814
She may be trying to catch him in a lie.

27:15.815 --> 27:17.816
By baiting him and insulting his family?

27:17.817 --> 27:19.818
That was just an act.

27:19.819 --> 27:20.819
I think her main objective was

27:20.820 --> 27:21.820
to convince both you and

27:21.821 --> 27:24.122
Winstone she has nothing
else on Danielle Marchetti.

27:24.123 --> 27:26.124
I'm impressed with Gates.

27:26.125 --> 27:27.125
Why?

27:27.126 --> 27:28.126
He brought Ellen.

27:28.127 --> 27:29.227
He wants her insight.

27:29.228 --> 27:30.461
Into the case?

27:30.462 --> 27:33.731
Into me.

27:33.799 --> 27:35.833
You think Patty knows more?

27:35.834 --> 27:36.834
I guarantee it.

27:36.835 --> 27:38.870
Danielle Marchetti is the weak link.

27:38.871 --> 27:41.038
She's the innocent
caught up in the scheme.

27:41.039 --> 27:42.306
That's who Patty goes after.

27:42.307 --> 27:44.976
If you want my advice,
let her take the lead.

27:44.977 --> 27:47.077
Why would I do that?

27:47.145 --> 27:48.179
Because whatever the

27:48.180 --> 27:53.584
Tobins are hiding, Patty will find it.

28:06.565 --> 28:09.800
He's back in the city
and he's drinking again.

28:09.802 --> 28:10.802
Are you sure?

28:10.803 --> 28:11.803
Yes, sir.

28:11.804 --> 28:14.339
We have to be 100% certain here.

28:14.340 --> 28:17.475
Oh, I am.

28:17.542 --> 28:19.709
All right.

28:19.911 --> 28:21.978
Do you want me to act now?

28:22.046 --> 28:25.114
No. Stay on him.

28:30.621 --> 28:34.692
Did I ever tell you what I wanted
to be as a boy back in Queens?

28:34.693 --> 28:36.793
A cop.

28:36.861 --> 28:41.132
Wanted to help people.

28:41.199 --> 28:44.201
Fight the bad guys.

28:55.247 --> 28:58.882
What did he say?

28:58.950 --> 29:04.588
Joe's still drinking.

29:07.158 --> 29:10.160
All right.

29:21.171 --> 29:24.173
I've made my decision, Lenny.

29:27.177 --> 29:30.212
Okay.

29:37.888 --> 29:43.788
Do you think Mr. Shayes was
distressed about the Tobin case?

29:46.925 --> 29:49.860
He wouldn't tell me what it was.

29:49.928 --> 29:51.962
Patty, I can't talk right now.

29:51.963 --> 29:52.963
Where are you?

29:52.964 --> 29:53.997
Oh, goddamn it!

29:53.998 --> 29:56.032
Tell me what's going on.

29:56.033 --> 29:57.400
Noting is going on.

29:57.401 --> 29:59.736
I need to see you, Tom.

29:59.737 --> 30:00.737
We have to talk.

30:00.738 --> 30:02.772
Tom? Tom?!

30:05.375 --> 30:09.211
Patty, I got to go.

30:09.278 --> 30:12.580
So he just hung up on you?

30:12.648 --> 30:14.082
Yes.

30:14.083 --> 30:19.988
You'd had no contact with Mr.
Shayes since that phone call?

30:21.925 --> 30:25.927
I didn't hear from him again.

30:51.272 --> 30:52.106
Hello?

30:52.107 --> 30:55.476
Are you alone?

30:55.543 --> 30:57.678
Excuse me?

30:57.745 --> 31:00.814
What do you figure they'll give me?

31:00.815 --> 31:04.052
150? 200 years?

31:04.120 --> 31:05.587
Mr. Tobin?

31:05.588 --> 31:09.957
I guess the good news is I
won't serve the full term.

31:15.599 --> 31:19.468
My son decided not to see me on

31:19.536 --> 31:22.673
my last night of freedom.

31:22.741 --> 31:25.475
Well, if you're looking
to repent, Mr. Tobin,

31:25.542 --> 31:27.876
just tell me where the money is.

31:30.513 --> 31:33.515
I'm not a good father.

31:33.583 --> 31:36.218
And I'm not a psychiatrist.

31:36.219 --> 31:39.888
You're the only person I
could think of to talk to.

31:39.889 --> 31:42.658
Maybe it's because you have a son.

31:42.659 --> 31:43.660
Do you trust him?

31:43.661 --> 31:45.428
You better get some sleep.

31:45.429 --> 31:46.696
You have a big day tomorrow.

31:46.697 --> 31:49.666
Does your son trust you?

31:49.667 --> 31:51.968
Good night, Mr. Tobin.

31:52.036 --> 31:58.408
I just want Joe to stop bashing
his head against the wall.

31:58.475 --> 32:00.375
Mr. Tobin?

34:58.863 --> 35:00.763
Yes?

35:00.799 --> 35:03.134
I think he may be turning over a new leaf.

35:03.135 --> 35:06.170
Looks like he's staying
away from the stuff.

35:13.546 --> 35:15.647
I'm ready, Karl.

35:15.715 --> 35:19.720
Well, keep an eye on him, will you?

35:19.787 --> 35:23.792
I want to make sure he
stays out of trouble.

36:46.510 --> 36:47.910
Thanks for coming.

36:47.911 --> 36:51.580
I didn't know if you'd
take me up on my invitation.

36:51.648 --> 36:55.651
I told you, Patty, if you
wanted to talk just to call me.

37:03.292 --> 37:09.932
Did you have a good dinner with
your family the other night?

37:10.000 --> 37:13.436
Oh, it was, um, interesting.

37:13.503 --> 37:16.973
I met my sister's baby for the first time.

37:16.974 --> 37:19.542
Oh, wonderful.

37:19.610 --> 37:23.278
So, how's, uh, Michael doing, anyway?

37:23.281 --> 37:24.948
He seems to be doing
quite well without me.

37:24.949 --> 37:26.617
Well, that would make sense.

37:26.618 --> 37:29.518
You always said you
were a terrible mother.

37:40.498 --> 37:45.872
Why haven't you told Gates everything
you know about Danielle Marchetti?

37:45.940 --> 37:48.041
Let's not talk business.

37:48.042 --> 37:52.146
Isn't that why I'm here?

37:52.214 --> 37:56.684
You're seducing me with bourbon.

37:56.751 --> 38:01.756
You want an ally in the D.A.'s office.

38:03.757 --> 38:04.590
Believe it or not,

38:04.591 --> 38:09.853
Ellen, I just want your company.

38:09.920 --> 38:13.781
You need to learn to let go of work.

39:08.822 --> 39:11.317
I'm... I'm probably going
to have to ask you to

39:11.318 --> 39:14.552
stay available for the next few days.

39:14.553 --> 39:15.386
And we're probably going to

39:15.387 --> 39:17.787
have to talk to your
other employees as well.

39:17.788 --> 39:22.790
Tom was like family to me, Detective.

39:26.060 --> 39:30.962
I'll help you any way I can.

39:31.030 --> 39:32.930
No. No.

39:33.865 --> 39:35.065
No!

39:35.066 --> 39:38.963
I don't understand! I told
you not to go through with it!

39:38.964 --> 39:40.792
I told you to stop!

39:40.793 --> 39:43.227
I told you, I told you to stop!
