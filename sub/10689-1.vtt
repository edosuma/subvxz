00:50.200 --> 00:51.699
Hey, Don. It's Daniel.

00:51.700 --> 00:53.950
Listen. Don't put the boiler in
until I get back.

00:54.724 --> 00:56.200
The framing inspection
isn't before a couple of weeks,

00:56.201 --> 00:57.799
So we got plenty of time.

00:57.800 --> 01:00.200
I'll check in with you guys
in a couple of days, ok?

01:00.201 --> 01:05.200
Take care. Bye.

01:13.500 --> 01:15.900
First thing I will do is try
to find another producer.

01:15.901 --> 01:18.300
There's gotta to be somebody else
in town who could help us out.

01:18.301 --> 01:21.899
Just for the pre-game.

01:21.900 --> 01:24.600
Hold on just a second, Cal.

01:24.601 --> 01:29.600
Hey, just one second.

01:30.100 --> 01:32.799
I gotta go.

01:32.800 --> 01:35.200
Call me back if you need me. Good luck!

01:35.201 --> 01:36.899
Ok, bye.

01:36.900 --> 01:38.600
Hey, I'm so sorry.

01:38.601 --> 01:39.799
What's up?

01:39.800 --> 01:42.599
I got stuck in the phone with Cal.

01:42.600 --> 01:46.800
The crew hasn't even made it to the arena yet.

01:46.801 --> 01:51.800
That's not good.

01:52.600 --> 01:56.800
I don't know what they gonna do.

01:56.801 --> 01:59.550
Are all the lights out?

01:59.551 --> 02:02.300
No. They're all on.

02:02.301 --> 02:05.999
Just checking.

02:06.000 --> 02:08.300
Are you sure you want
to load that thing with you?

02:08.300 --> 02:09.800
I don't even think we can get online there.

02:09.800 --> 02:14.800
Oh, we can. I checked.

02:20.800 --> 02:22.699
All set?

02:22.700 --> 02:27.700
Let's just try to remember...

02:27.800 --> 02:29.499
It's Cal.

02:29.500 --> 02:33.399
Hey, just a second.

02:33.400 --> 02:35.500
This is supposed to be a vacation.

02:35.501 --> 02:39.000
I know. And boy, do we need one.

02:39.001 --> 02:42.599
Hey, what's up?

02:42.600 --> 02:47.600
Well, that could work.

04:23.700 --> 04:25.199
Hey.

04:25.200 --> 04:28.854
We're all set for the morning.
We have to be at the dock at 8:30.

04:33.500 --> 04:34.700
Did you have a little shower?

04:34.701 --> 04:36.800
Yes.

04:36.801 --> 04:38.899
Great.

04:38.900 --> 04:42.599
I'm so glad I made you bring this.

04:42.600 --> 04:46.699
There's gotta be thundershowers
tomorrow night late.

04:46.700 --> 04:48.300
Looks like it's gonna be crowded
in the boat tomorrow.

04:48.301 --> 04:50.399
I hope it's not a cattle boat.

04:50.400 --> 04:53.300
We'll just do our own thing. Did you ask?

04:53.301 --> 04:56.000
No. They seem pretty relaxed.

04:56.001 --> 04:57.899
Why is it so hot here?

04:57.900 --> 05:00.100
Air conditioner is blasted.

05:00.101 --> 05:02.099
Figures.

05:02.100 --> 05:04.583
- We didn't come for the room.
- That's for sure.

05:04.700 --> 05:07.259
Considering how much time we had
to put this whole thing together,

05:07.459 --> 05:09.400
I'm amazed if we got anything.

05:09.401 --> 05:11.200
I'm not complaining.

05:11.201 --> 05:14.699
Yes, you are.

05:14.700 --> 05:15.899
Alright, I'm done.

05:15.900 --> 05:17.099
Want to check your email?

05:17.100 --> 05:22.100
No. I'm on vacation, remember?

05:24.000 --> 05:29.000
Right.

07:27.900 --> 07:32.900
That tasted good.

07:53.500 --> 07:55.800
His face!

07:55.801 --> 07:56.899
You too.

07:56.900 --> 07:59.100
Yeah. It's different. I'm a girl.

07:59.101 --> 08:02.074
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.600
So how are you?

08:08.601 --> 08:11.799
Fine.

08:11.800 --> 08:15.800
A little stressed. Still I guess.

08:15.801 --> 08:18.039
It's about work?

08:18.239 --> 08:21.409
Yeah, work, life.

08:22.800 --> 08:26.013
Maybe I can get you
to think of something else.

08:37.600 --> 08:39.227
You ok?

08:42.400 --> 08:45.561
I might not be in the mood.

08:47.200 --> 08:50.800
Just thought like
you might be a second ago.

08:50.801 --> 08:54.899
Could go either way, I guess.

08:54.900 --> 08:59.900
Maybe I need to give you a little nudge.

09:08.600 --> 09:11.199
Yeah, I'm not in the mood.

09:11.200 --> 09:15.100
That wasn't the direction
I was trying to nudge you in.

09:15.101 --> 09:20.100
Sorry. I'm just tired.

09:22.800 --> 09:25.541
It's been a long day.

09:28.200 --> 09:29.799
We can talk.

09:29.800 --> 09:31.599
Nah, you are right.

09:31.600 --> 09:33.700
We should get some sleep.

09:33.701 --> 09:37.200
I'm wiped.

09:37.201 --> 09:40.700
Very funny.

11:52.300 --> 11:55.499
All right, ladies and gentlemen...

11:55.500 --> 11:59.400
Welcome aboard the
world famous "Reef Explorer".

11:59.401 --> 12:00.799
My name's Davis.

12:00.800 --> 12:03.600
I'm going to be one of the guides
on board our vessel today.

12:03.601 --> 12:06.899
Also driving your boat
with, huh, Linda

12:06.900 --> 12:10.050
and Junior. Junior is gonna be
the next guide on board our vessel.

12:10.051 --> 12:13.200
We are going to be knocked
to a dive site called "Magic Kingdom".

12:13.378 --> 12:16.196
Now things you want to look for
down there on this dive:

12:16.396 --> 12:18.344
spotted eels, spotted morays,

12:18.544 --> 12:21.555
enough of stingrays in the sand,
there's angelfish, parrot fish,

12:21.755 --> 12:24.319
tropical fish, barbed beauties...

12:24.500 --> 12:27.700
Is there any big fish
like sharks or anything?

12:27.701 --> 12:29.299
Yeah. We're going out
to the open ocean,

12:29.300 --> 12:32.550
so chances are you probably
might see a shark or three.

12:32.551 --> 12:35.800
But, you know, like I tell
everybody who see a shark,

12:35.801 --> 12:38.000
if you don't want to see it, close your eyes.

12:38.001 --> 12:40.099
No problem.

12:40.100 --> 12:42.950
Sharks over here are not
very aggressive towards human beings,

12:42.951 --> 12:45.800
so therefore you don't really
have to worry about sharks.

12:45.801 --> 12:48.399
Ok.

12:48.400 --> 12:53.400
Ok, that's enough guys.
Enjoy the ride out.

14:07.400 --> 14:10.082
Ok, guys. I need to have
your attention for just a few minutes.

14:10.201 --> 14:12.000
We are going to be entering
the water in a minute.

14:12.202 --> 14:15.778
Once that everybody has entered their gear,
what we want you to do is

14:15.978 --> 14:18.000
a buddy system to enter the water first.

14:18.001 --> 14:21.079
Once that buddy systems are in the water,
we are going to have guided divers,

14:21.279 --> 14:24.718
and myself, Linda, and Junior,
is gonna help you guys get into water.

14:24.918 --> 14:27.826
Linda is on surface support, so
if you surface in a distance away from the boat,

14:28.026 --> 14:29.964
You want to let her know that you are OK.

14:30.164 --> 14:33.597
You start to let her know you are OK
by giving her a big "O" over your head.

14:33.797 --> 14:36.550
If you are not Ok, you do
the international distress signal.

14:36.750 --> 14:38.200
The international
distress signal is simple,

14:38.401 --> 14:40.700
very easy to do. It's like this:

14:40.701 --> 14:42.799
"Help!"

14:42.800 --> 14:45.399
Ok? All right?

14:45.400 --> 14:47.460
Very easy, very simple.

14:47.660 --> 14:49.499
Once everybody's in the water,

14:49.500 --> 14:52.050
I want you to make your way
to the white float ball.

14:52.051 --> 14:54.600
The white float ball
is at the stern of the boat.

14:54.601 --> 14:57.181
- We want you to huh...
- May I sit there?

14:57.301 --> 15:00.744
- Excuse me.
- I'm sorry. Go ahead. I'm sorry.

15:00.745 --> 15:04.662
Is that your mask?
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

15:05.200 --> 15:07.742
- You didn't bring your mask?
- I brought it. I don't know what happened.

15:07.801 --> 15:10.199
It was supposed to be here.

15:10.200 --> 15:12.700
Sorry, sorry everybody.
I'm just, you know...

15:13.182 --> 15:16.170
Anxious to dive. I don't wanna...
Do you have extra masks on the...

15:16.351 --> 15:19.227
- Linda, did you bring an extra mask?
- You have an extra mask, Linda?

15:19.264 --> 15:20.900
No, I don't have an extra mask.

15:20.901 --> 15:22.524
- Junior?
- Anyone?

15:22.724 --> 15:24.249
Does anyone have an extra mask?

15:24.449 --> 15:25.432
No.

15:25.632 --> 15:26.800
You can't dive without a mask.

15:26.801 --> 15:29.300
Yeah, I understand that.

15:29.301 --> 15:31.799
Thank you, Travis.

15:31.800 --> 15:34.799
Davis, Davis.
I'm sorry guys. Go on.

15:34.800 --> 15:38.805
Alright guys. The dive is going to be
at a maximum drop of 60 feet, so...

15:39.005 --> 15:43.608
Therefore, we are going to be
down there for about 35 minutes.

16:29.300 --> 16:31.200
You are ready?

16:31.201 --> 16:32.772
Yeah.

17:46.400 --> 17:49.196
- Are you ok?
- Yeah, I'm ok.

17:49.300 --> 17:51.699
I can't equalize my ears.

17:51.700 --> 17:53.600
Ok. Are you going
to report to the guardian,

17:53.935 --> 17:56.199
trying to get equalized?

17:56.200 --> 17:58.000
I don't think I can go down.

17:58.001 --> 17:59.760
Alright, do me a favor.
Inflate your BC,

17:59.960 --> 18:01.450
put the regulator in your mouth

18:01.451 --> 18:03.300
and swim back towards the platform.

18:03.301 --> 18:05.150
Ok.

18:08.000 --> 18:10.221
Up, stand up, stretch your knees up.

18:29.600 --> 18:31.500
- How was it down there?
- I didn't get down.

18:31.700 --> 18:33.928
You didn't. Why not?
What happened?

18:35.301 --> 18:40.300
I can't get my ears equalized.

18:40.700 --> 18:42.050
You feel all right?

18:42.051 --> 18:43.399
Yeah, I'm good. Thanks.

18:43.400 --> 18:47.399
You mind if I borrow this? Is it ok?

18:47.859 --> 18:49.400
I'll bring it right back.
Save some time. Yeah?

18:49.738 --> 18:54.344
- Sure.
- Thank you. God bless you. I Love you.

18:55.006 --> 18:56.199
Are you going down now?

18:56.200 --> 18:57.897
Yeah, Linda, I'm going down.

18:58.201 --> 18:59.281
Hallelujah.

18:59.481 --> 19:00.398
The only problem I have is

19:00.598 --> 19:01.799
you don't have a buddy right now.

19:01.800 --> 19:03.200
I don't need a buddy.
I've dived all my life.

19:03.201 --> 19:04.861
Unfortunately you do
if you're on our boat, sir.

19:05.061 --> 19:06.761
Your boat.

19:07.100 --> 19:09.282
Give me a break.
Find a buddy for me.

19:09.482 --> 19:10.801
Someone down there's
coming back up.

19:11.001 --> 19:12.199
Can you dive with me?

19:12.816 --> 19:16.361
Unfortunately, if I don't find you
a buddy, I can't let you go, sir.

19:16.673 --> 19:20.003
I love high water.
I'm diving in the finest. Help me.

19:20.200 --> 19:22.450
Come on, dive.

19:22.451 --> 19:26.075
- What's your name?
- Brian.

19:26.076 --> 19:29.744
Are you ready to go, Brian?
We're set. See? I got a buddy.

19:38.100 --> 19:39.143
All set.

19:39.400 --> 19:41.177
- Sir, your regulator.
- Regulator.

19:41.377 --> 19:44.064
- Yes, sir.
- Yeah, got one of those.

19:50.500 --> 19:51.800
Have a good time.

19:51.801 --> 19:53.527
Thank you.

19:55.100 --> 19:56.200
There's a place
in Heaven for you.

19:56.201 --> 19:58.768
I love you. Thank you.

21:41.400 --> 21:43.778
It was great, man.

22:23.000 --> 22:24.400
- Yeah, I'm good. You good?
- Yeah.

22:24.715 --> 22:27.045
Thanks buddy. I appreciated.

22:28.801 --> 22:30.399
Thanks a lot.

22:30.400 --> 22:32.785
You are an angel. I needed that.

22:38.000 --> 22:40.526
- Did you see that shark down there?
- Yeah.

23:30.800 --> 23:32.593
Did everybody enjoy their dive?

23:32.793 --> 23:34.250
Yeah.

23:34.450 --> 23:35.719
That's good.

23:51.800 --> 23:54.039
Have we got everybody?

25:29.900 --> 25:33.500
Daniel, where is the boat?

25:33.501 --> 25:35.373
It's a good question.

25:36.700 --> 25:39.400
I guess it's one of those.

25:40.300 --> 25:41.750
You gotta be kidding me.

25:42.181 --> 25:43.725
It better be one of those.

25:44.308 --> 25:45.700
But which one do you think?

25:45.901 --> 25:47.990
I don't know.

25:51.800 --> 25:54.476
- Did you get us lost?
- No.

25:54.676 --> 25:55.900
So we are in the right spot?

25:55.901 --> 25:58.567
Yes. I'm 90% sure.

25:58.767 --> 26:01.199
90%? Why only 90%?

26:01.389 --> 26:03.583
'cause the boat is not here.

26:05.000 --> 26:07.900
There is a coral head
exactly 42 feet below us.

26:08.108 --> 26:10.189
I marked it on the way down.

26:14.361 --> 26:15.800
Yeah. I can still see the stocks.

26:16.068 --> 26:17.180
The stocks?

26:17.181 --> 26:21.538
Yeah, there's three prawn,
like a forked thing

26:21.738 --> 26:23.517
right below us.

26:24.600 --> 26:26.236
You are unbelievable.

26:27.300 --> 26:29.275
You can still find some of
those little coral formation

26:29.475 --> 26:30.738
in the middle of the ocean, but

26:30.938 --> 26:32.400
you get lost going to my mother's.

26:32.601 --> 26:34.375
I need an incentive.

26:34.920 --> 26:37.020
You love my mother.

26:39.200 --> 26:41.889
They obviously cannot see us.

26:45.100 --> 26:46.601
You think it's time to swim?

26:46.801 --> 26:48.951
Swim where?

26:51.500 --> 26:53.631
I don't know. I think...

26:53.923 --> 26:55.200
That one is the closest.

26:55.687 --> 26:56.800
Honey, it's a bad idea.

26:56.801 --> 26:57.899
Why?

26:58.078 --> 27:00.500
Because we are not sure
that's our boat.

27:00.501 --> 27:02.199
And if it's not our boat,

27:02.523 --> 27:05.800
That means we could swim
farther from our boat.

27:06.637 --> 27:09.836
Besides, you know how far away that is?

27:10.036 --> 27:11.499
It's really far.

27:11.594 --> 27:12.499
It's farther than that.

27:12.979 --> 27:15.705
And if it's not our boat,
they can pull away at anytime.

27:16.123 --> 27:18.597
And our fucking boat,
wherever the hell it is,

27:18.797 --> 27:21.255
will have a hell of time
trying to find us.

27:39.600 --> 27:40.500
You're going somewhere?

27:40.501 --> 27:42.641
Just my face.

28:19.900 --> 28:21.299
I hate to tell you this, but,

28:21.761 --> 28:24.875
I didn't see anything that looks like
any kind of coral formation.

28:25.075 --> 28:28.676
Could you just show me?
I'd just feel better. Sure?

28:45.939 --> 28:48.045
See it? Cause I don't see anything.

28:48.245 --> 28:50.609
- Shit!
- What?

28:50.800 --> 28:52.600
You don't see it, because it's not there.

28:53.103 --> 28:53.399
So does that mean...

28:53.400 --> 28:56.150
...that since we've surfaced,
we're drifting.

28:57.022 --> 28:59.795
Oh, shit. But what does
that mean? Should we swim?

28:59.927 --> 29:01.900
Goddam it. We wasted all this time.

29:02.247 --> 29:04.108
Honey I hate to tell you this,
but swim or not,

29:04.308 --> 29:07.017
we're going
where this current decides.

29:10.000 --> 29:11.867
Are they moving?

29:14.201 --> 29:16.600
Hey! Yes.

29:17.287 --> 29:18.899
Oh God.

29:18.962 --> 29:20.580
Please let this be them.

29:20.680 --> 29:22.095
- It's gotta be, right?
- Yes.

29:22.490 --> 29:24.520
- They're coming right this way.
- Yep.

29:26.700 --> 29:28.701
You realize that's a distress signal.

29:28.901 --> 29:31.082
We are in distress.

30:31.427 --> 30:33.200
Daniel, did you just pee?

30:33.545 --> 30:34.138
Yep.

30:34.338 --> 30:35.899
You're so disgusting.

30:36.168 --> 30:38.447
You said you are a little cold.

30:59.569 --> 31:01.600
Daniel, was that a shark?

31:01.701 --> 31:04.495
Maybe, or a dolphin.

31:05.892 --> 31:08.184
If it was a dolphin, you'd be on your way
over there to play with it,

31:08.384 --> 31:10.654
so you obviously think it was a shark.

31:11.801 --> 31:14.652
- That's all we need right now.
- That's ok.

31:16.300 --> 31:19.377
You were patting a shark
less than an hour ago.

31:19.569 --> 31:22.754
Please, that was nothing
but a big old catfish.

31:25.600 --> 31:28.461
It was more than two hours ago.

31:34.000 --> 31:37.754
You know, now I'm starting
to really get cold.

31:40.892 --> 31:42.312
It's ok.

31:45.400 --> 31:47.432
Oh, Jesus Christ!

31:49.087 --> 31:50.735
I thought he said they
never come that close.

31:50.935 --> 31:53.751
They also said the boat would be here.

32:23.000 --> 32:24.447
It's gone.

32:25.940 --> 32:27.943
It was probably just curious.

32:29.507 --> 32:31.200
A couple of bodies floating up
in the middle of nowhere,

32:31.492 --> 32:33.981
I'm sure it's not
something it sees everyday.

32:34.901 --> 32:37.632
Oh, Daniel.
Where the hell are they?

32:40.100 --> 32:42.488
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

32:44.101 --> 32:46.286
It makes me feel better.

32:46.852 --> 32:48.600
But what do we do if it comes back?

32:48.812 --> 32:49.871
I don't know.

32:50.000 --> 32:51.199
Do we splash? Do we stay still?

32:51.389 --> 32:52.700
You are the one who watches "Shark Week".

32:53.186 --> 32:54.200
First of all, we should be in a cage.

32:54.401 --> 32:56.867
No, we should be on land.

33:00.300 --> 33:05.545
- Sharks are attracted to wounded fish.
- Ok.

33:05.600 --> 33:09.400
So I guess you just
not splash around too much.

33:09.401 --> 33:10.675
- Just sort of...
- Stay still?

33:10.875 --> 33:12.700
Try to stay still.

33:12.701 --> 33:13.977
Oh, God.

33:14.400 --> 33:19.374
Ok. I can't stand
not knowing if it's under me.

33:21.900 --> 33:24.497
- I'm just gonna look, ok?
- Ok.

34:31.992 --> 34:33.221
Okay.

34:35.699 --> 34:41.032
Katharine Hepburn
and Nick Nolte in "Grace Quigley"

34:41.301 --> 34:49.755
and Nick Nolte and
John Malkovich in "Mulholland Falls".

34:50.800 --> 34:53.060
How's that for a quick.

34:54.201 --> 34:56.402
Always quick.

34:56.800 --> 34:59.184
All right. It's your turn.

35:00.101 --> 35:01.878
I, hum...

35:05.500 --> 35:10.253
You know, I really
don't feel like playing.

35:10.410 --> 35:11.435
Okay.

35:17.913 --> 35:19.800
Feel hungry?

35:20.313 --> 35:22.037
Of course.

35:23.301 --> 35:25.233
I'm starving.

35:25.433 --> 35:27.083
- Ouch! Shit!
- What?

35:27.283 --> 35:28.600
Something just bit me here...

35:29.527 --> 35:30.343
What? Where?

35:30.700 --> 35:33.684
I don't know.
It's right down by my ankle.

35:33.901 --> 35:36.169
Oh, God. It kills.

35:38.124 --> 35:40.639
Goddam it! It burns!

35:40.839 --> 35:42.836
I don't see anything.

35:46.691 --> 35:47.995
- Did it get you?
- Yes!

35:48.195 --> 35:48.994
- What is it?
- I don't know,

35:49.194 --> 35:51.050
but the fucker really
stung me. It hurts.

35:51.680 --> 35:54.558
- Let's get the hell out of here.
- Okay.

36:45.938 --> 36:47.655
- I think we are away from them.
- Is that far enough?

36:47.925 --> 36:49.266
Anything?
You got anything?

36:49.466 --> 36:50.615
No.

36:53.900 --> 36:55.800
Damn, those fuckers stung.

36:55.801 --> 36:57.841
I know.

36:59.100 --> 37:01.100
Where did it get you?

37:01.101 --> 37:02.550
On my ankle, on my leg.

37:02.892 --> 37:04.118
Through your wet suit?

37:04.318 --> 37:07.125
I don't know. I guess so.

37:08.601 --> 37:10.176
So are you ok?

37:10.376 --> 37:12.799
No. I'm not ok.

37:13.112 --> 37:16.448
Are you ok?
We find our boat, we'll be ok.

37:16.648 --> 37:18.333
Oh, come on, honey.

37:18.601 --> 37:21.770
I know, I know, I know.
I'm sorry.

37:22.402 --> 37:23.099
It really sucks,

37:23.419 --> 37:24.800
but we're going
to get through this, ok?

37:25.205 --> 37:27.264
Ok.

37:31.400 --> 37:33.100
I know I know.

37:33.463 --> 37:34.981
God, okay.

37:38.500 --> 37:41.600
I've just never heard of anything
so fucked up in my entire life.

37:41.821 --> 37:44.600
Who's ever heard of
two people getting

37:44.733 --> 37:47.600
left in the middle of the ocean before?

37:47.683 --> 37:49.982
I have actually.

37:50.701 --> 37:52.346
- You have?
- Yeah.

37:52.504 --> 37:53.775
Where?

37:54.400 --> 37:56.273
Dive magazines.

37:56.473 --> 37:59.070
It's a lot more common than you think.

37:59.800 --> 38:02.960
Well, thanks for telling me
when we got certified.

38:22.790 --> 38:23.861
Over there.

38:24.061 --> 38:27.076
Oh, my God. Oh, Daniel.

38:27.276 --> 38:30.696
Oh, God. Please, please,
please, let just be them.

38:30.800 --> 38:32.500
Oh, God. I don't even care
if it's not them.

38:32.622 --> 38:35.264
Just please see us and pick us up.

38:50.100 --> 38:52.609
I don't think they can see us.

39:07.191 --> 39:09.923
Wish we had more sun.

39:16.200 --> 39:18.889
- They can't see us.
- I know.

39:30.800 --> 39:32.470
They are leaving.

39:33.101 --> 39:34.930
Yeah.

40:10.400 --> 40:15.400
Stay close.

40:24.800 --> 40:27.187
What if they don't know we're missing?

40:27.301 --> 40:29.228
There's no way.

40:29.600 --> 40:32.957
They took a head count
on the boat. I saw it.

40:33.157 --> 40:36.550
Our stuff is on board.
We have their tanks.

40:36.686 --> 40:38.467
And we know we've drifted.

40:38.800 --> 40:41.718
It may take them a while,
but they will find us.

40:46.500 --> 40:50.900
I hate to tell you, but
I think my dramamine is running off.

40:50.901 --> 40:53.708
- You're getting nauseous?
- Yeah.

40:54.200 --> 40:57.530
- Honey, I could kill those fuckers.
- I know.

40:57.700 --> 41:02.700
It's just all this going
up and down of the weights, I think.

41:05.100 --> 41:06.899
You're probably getting dehydrated.

41:07.100 --> 41:09.700
Yeah? But we can't drink the water, right?

41:09.872 --> 41:13.100
No. I should've told you that before.

41:13.227 --> 41:15.000
You didn't, did you?

41:15.172 --> 41:16.150
A little.

41:16.167 --> 41:17.299
Honey, stop.

41:17.400 --> 41:20.600
It will give you diarrhea, and
make you even more dehydrated.

41:20.750 --> 41:23.748
Great. "Shark Week"?

41:23.845 --> 41:26.870
"Disasters At Sea", History Channel.

41:27.500 --> 41:29.700
I guess this means
I have to stop complaining

41:29.701 --> 41:32.799
about you watching
so much television.

41:33.500 --> 41:36.553
But I didn't know
I might get something out of this.

41:39.800 --> 41:43.300
I'm really, really not feeling well.

41:43.301 --> 41:44.899
Oh, man.

41:44.900 --> 41:47.000
You think maybe
if I took my weights out.

41:47.001 --> 41:50.950
then it wouldn't
pull on me so much?

41:50.951 --> 41:54.054
Just keep the belt, drop the weights.

42:10.364 --> 42:16.100
You'll see'em try
to charge us for those.

42:19.700 --> 42:23.963
Oh, hey. We should put our gloves on.

42:26.900 --> 42:28.607
How are your stings?

42:29.401 --> 42:30.762
Still there.

42:31.335 --> 42:34.768
They're the one thing I think
the salt water is actually helping.

42:36.601 --> 42:38.825
This glove isn't helping them.

42:46.500 --> 42:48.899
I don't feel very good.

42:48.900 --> 42:50.400
Why don't you
lay back for a little bit?

42:50.505 --> 42:52.255
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Just lay back.

42:52.455 --> 42:55.477
- I'm sorry.
- It's ok. I got you.

42:55.701 --> 42:57.887
- Just relax.
- Ok.

42:58.455 --> 43:00.710
- There you go.
- Ok.

43:01.400 --> 43:02.600
Just for a few minutes.

43:02.601 --> 43:03.799
Just relax.

43:03.800 --> 43:08.800
Close your eyes.

43:13.800 --> 43:18.624
Daniel, I have to pee.

43:19.700 --> 43:21.370
Ok.

43:22.500 --> 43:24.300
It's gonna be warm for a minute.

43:24.493 --> 43:26.099
Thanks.

44:22.000 --> 44:23.244
Daniel!

44:30.600 --> 44:33.238
Oh, God. Daniel!

45:14.000 --> 45:15.820
Daniel!

45:20.400 --> 45:21.961
Susanne!

45:24.700 --> 45:26.761
Daniel, I'm over here.

45:26.801 --> 45:28.919
Susanne!

45:50.400 --> 45:52.001
Oh, thank God.

45:56.928 --> 45:59.940
It's ok. I got you.

46:01.200 --> 46:03.403
- Oh, my God. What happened?
- I don't know.

46:03.603 --> 46:05.408
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine. You ok?

46:05.475 --> 46:06.636
What happened?
Where did you go?

46:06.836 --> 46:08.883
I must have fallen asleep
and we drifted apart.

46:09.083 --> 46:10.248
- Jesus.
- I'm sorry.

46:10.448 --> 46:11.800
You scared the hell out of me.

46:11.801 --> 46:13.599
I'm so sorry.

46:13.600 --> 46:16.100
It's ok. I'm glad you are here.

46:16.101 --> 46:17.300
Oh, my God.

46:17.301 --> 46:18.499
It's ok.

46:18.500 --> 46:21.100
How long are we sleeping?

46:21.101 --> 46:23.699
God, I'm so out of it.

46:23.700 --> 46:29.455
Jesus, we've been
in the water for 7 hours.

46:32.500 --> 46:34.400
Daniel, I feel something on my leg.

46:34.401 --> 46:35.599
What?

46:35.600 --> 46:36.700
I don't know. It hurts.

46:36.701 --> 46:38.600
It's your sting?

46:38.601 --> 46:40.499
The wrong leg.

46:40.500 --> 46:42.700
Oh, my God. it really hurts.

46:42.701 --> 46:45.400
We just try to keep...

46:47.399 --> 46:48.099
I don't see anything.

46:48.100 --> 46:49.799
I can't either. It's on the back.

46:50.082 --> 46:53.470
I just can't tell.
Hurt all over the whole thing.

46:53.701 --> 46:55.100
Just leave it alone. Ok? Don't tap it.

46:55.101 --> 46:56.899
I'm not touching it.

46:56.900 --> 46:58.186
Well, something is touching it.

46:58.386 --> 47:00.346
It's not me, honey. I'm not here.
My hands are all here.

47:00.546 --> 47:03.055
- Something is tapping on it.
- I will take a look.

47:03.201 --> 47:04.342
Jesus.

47:05.900 --> 47:08.337
Oh, God. I feel sick.

47:55.800 --> 47:58.985
I'm sorry, honey. I threw up.

48:01.000 --> 48:02.889
Fish gotta eat too.

48:03.700 --> 48:07.044
Speaking of which,
the thing patting at your leg,

48:07.244 --> 48:08.300
is just a little cleaner fish.

48:08.301 --> 48:10.289
What about my leg?

48:10.401 --> 48:12.499
A little cut.

48:12.500 --> 48:15.290
- How could it get cut?
- I don't know.

48:15.500 --> 48:17.700
Maybe you rub it against my knife
over sleeping, or something.

48:17.701 --> 48:20.300
Oh, come on. It wasn't a shark, was it?

48:20.570 --> 48:22.599
- No, honey.
- Are you sure?

48:22.845 --> 48:24.700
No. If it was a shark,
your leg would be gone.

48:24.701 --> 48:25.775
Great.

48:27.000 --> 48:28.900
And most, it was a teeny little barracuda

48:28.901 --> 48:30.879
just checking to see if you tasted good.

48:30.880 --> 48:32.700
Oh, God. Is it deep?

48:32.701 --> 48:34.621
No, it's not deep.

48:34.622 --> 48:36.845
- Let's swim out this puke.
- Ok.

48:37.045 --> 48:38.361
Come on.

48:46.400 --> 48:47.800
That's far enough, you think?

48:47.801 --> 48:51.099
Yeah.

48:51.100 --> 48:52.400
Oh, baby. I'm sorry.

48:52.401 --> 48:55.499
I'm sorry.

48:55.500 --> 48:57.700
Rinse your mouth a little bit.

48:57.701 --> 48:58.699
Yeah.

48:58.700 --> 48:59.700
Just don't swallow any, ok?

48:59.701 --> 49:04.700
Spit it back out.

49:05.300 --> 49:07.153
Can still feel that tapping.

49:07.301 --> 49:08.652
- What, the fish?
- Yeah.

49:08.852 --> 49:13.600
Try not to focus on this. Relax.

49:13.601 --> 49:15.972
Here you go.

49:22.000 --> 49:24.600
What is it? Are you ok?

49:24.601 --> 49:26.250
It's leg cramp.

49:27.104 --> 49:28.025
Can I help you?

49:28.026 --> 49:29.601
Is there anything I can do?

49:29.814 --> 49:31.599
I got it. Ouch!

49:31.600 --> 49:33.772
We are really
falling apart, aren't we?

49:40.300 --> 49:43.250
Oh, God. Oh, Honey. Oh, God.

49:44.038 --> 49:46.199
They're gone. They're gone.

49:46.307 --> 49:49.000
Jesus, Daniel. What kind are they?

49:49.001 --> 49:50.299
The big ones.

49:50.300 --> 49:52.300
I'm serious. Are they the bad kind?

49:52.301 --> 49:53.867
I have no idea.

49:54.325 --> 49:56.327
Oh, my God.

50:13.000 --> 50:14.148
No, no, no. Be still.

50:15.243 --> 50:16.260
Don't splash around.

50:16.357 --> 50:19.566
Oh, my God. This can't be normal.

50:26.014 --> 50:30.313
Honey, oh, honey.

50:36.900 --> 50:37.950
I don't know what is worse,

50:37.951 --> 50:39.000
seeing them or not seeing them.

50:39.458 --> 50:40.804
Seeing them.

51:57.300 --> 51:59.640
Unbelievable.

51:59.800 --> 52:04.126
This is truly un-fucking believable.

52:05.200 --> 52:08.827
The best part is that we paid to do this.

52:08.927 --> 52:09.999
We paid to be out here.

52:10.200 --> 52:13.300
We paid those incompetent fuckers
to drop us out

52:13.301 --> 52:16.434
in the middle of the fucking ocean.

52:18.500 --> 52:22.904
We wanted an ocean view.
Boy, did we get it?

52:37.000 --> 52:38.663
You feel better?

52:40.800 --> 52:43.424
I wouldn't exactly call it better.

52:44.201 --> 52:46.156
You finished yelling?

52:47.801 --> 52:50.157
That could be.

52:51.200 --> 52:55.196
Oh, good. You're not the only one
stuck out here, you know.

52:56.300 --> 52:57.764
What? Are you mad at me?

52:57.965 --> 52:59.480
No.

53:01.100 --> 53:03.400
Why? Because I was yelling?

53:03.401 --> 53:04.975
No.

53:08.000 --> 53:11.404
Fine. You be mad.

53:12.700 --> 53:15.685
It's a great vacation, honey, isn't it?

53:24.100 --> 53:27.342
So now we entered no talking phase, uh?

53:29.676 --> 53:34.241
Could you maybe
answer one last question?

53:35.323 --> 53:40.267
Has this somehow over the hours
become my fault?

53:41.400 --> 53:43.621
Let's just drop it.

53:43.901 --> 53:45.870
Of course.

54:00.600 --> 54:02.984
You believe what you want to believe.

54:03.000 --> 54:06.450
But I know for certain that
we were in the right spot.

54:07.400 --> 54:09.900
It's not just a matter
of being in the right spot.

54:09.901 --> 54:12.299
It's being there on time.

54:12.371 --> 54:16.200
We were on time.
We were early. He said 10:30.

54:16.556 --> 54:18.700
Do we always have to get it so close?

54:18.701 --> 54:20.799
For God's sake,

54:20.800 --> 54:22.399
Why don't we stay with the group?

54:22.400 --> 54:25.850
We always have to do things
different than everybody else.

54:26.003 --> 54:29.300
We shouldn't have spent so much time
with that god damn eel.

54:29.301 --> 54:31.699
Well, that's a nice touch, adding "we".

54:31.700 --> 54:35.500
Especially since you wanted have
nothing to do with that fucking eel.

54:35.765 --> 54:37.799
Do you honestly, seriously, honey,

54:37.800 --> 54:40.800
Do you honestly think
that we got left behind

54:40.801 --> 54:43.209
because we were late?

54:43.501 --> 54:45.379
I'm serious.

54:45.500 --> 54:47.300
Do you have any idea
how idiotic that sounds?

54:47.301 --> 54:49.618
Oh, so now I'm an idiot.

54:49.900 --> 54:51.300
We are where we are, aren't we?

54:51.301 --> 54:55.182
Yes, fine, because of me.

54:55.301 --> 54:58.199
You refused to swim.

54:59.545 --> 55:02.121
My God. There were boats all around us.

55:02.301 --> 55:06.491
You refused, and now, look, look around us.

55:06.691 --> 55:09.100
We are stuck in the middle of the ocean.

55:09.330 --> 55:10.918
With nobody.

55:11.000 --> 55:14.104
Even if we had been swimming
for the last five hours,

55:14.304 --> 55:17.582
We would not be any closer
to a boat than we are now.

55:18.928 --> 55:21.500
The only reason we are even
out here in the first place,

55:21.501 --> 55:23.800
is because of your fucking job.

55:23.903 --> 55:26.046
- What?
- If it were not for your job,

55:26.246 --> 55:28.400
We would not have thrown out
our plan out of the window,

55:28.401 --> 55:30.400
Rush around the last minute, and

55:30.401 --> 55:32.400
Settled on this fucking trip.

55:32.519 --> 55:33.599
We would be at home,

55:33.600 --> 55:36.099
in the middle of our hectic lives,

55:36.349 --> 55:39.679
which right now sounds like heaven to me.

55:40.301 --> 55:41.899
And in a month's time,

55:41.900 --> 55:46.199
as we planned seven, seven months ago,

55:46.200 --> 55:49.300
we would be where we were
supposed to be in the first place,

55:49.301 --> 55:53.270
and paying less than
we are now to be shark bait.

55:55.800 --> 55:57.333
Oh, damn it.

56:00.100 --> 56:03.664
I can't even believe you
bring all that up right now.

56:04.101 --> 56:06.499
You were the one that picked the dates.

56:06.609 --> 56:10.850
Yeah, out of my whopping two choices,
this was the better date.

56:13.800 --> 56:15.869
I wanted to go skiing.

56:15.901 --> 56:17.891
Oh, God.

58:51.800 --> 58:54.594
I can't believe how far we've drifted.

58:55.000 --> 58:56.900
You think the current
will take us over there?

58:56.901 --> 58:58.813
Hopefully.

59:00.500 --> 59:02.311
How's your leg?

59:02.312 --> 59:03.985
It's ok.

59:04.451 --> 59:06.575
You know, hurts a little bit, but it...

59:06.576 --> 59:08.501
it's ok.

59:08.700 --> 59:11.417
All right, let's go for it.

01:00:12.200 --> 01:00:16.675
- I love you.
- I love you.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:20.964
We are gonna be fine.

01:00:22.600 --> 01:00:24.200
Other people going to vacations,

01:00:24.201 --> 01:00:25.982
they spend their days

01:00:26.601 --> 01:00:29.000
just laying around,

01:00:29.094 --> 01:00:31.399
eating and drinking.

01:00:31.431 --> 01:00:33.600
That sounds pretty good right now.

01:00:33.601 --> 01:00:35.848
Actually that could.

01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:38.600
This'll be the story we'll be telling

01:00:38.601 --> 01:00:41.155
for the rest of our lives.

01:00:47.300 --> 01:00:50.194
- Daniel.
- What?

01:00:53.238 --> 01:00:55.338
Look. Wait.

01:00:58.400 --> 01:01:01.250
Oh, my God.

01:01:02.700 --> 01:01:05.325
Wait. They are five of them.

01:01:05.401 --> 01:01:07.391
Look. Hold on.

01:01:07.600 --> 01:01:09.259
Where those comes from?

01:01:09.500 --> 01:01:12.330
You know how dry my mouth gets
when I'm diving,

01:01:12.501 --> 01:01:13.400
I wanted put them in the dive's bag

01:01:13.401 --> 01:01:14.699
but you had it,

01:01:14.700 --> 01:01:16.863
so I stuffed them in here
at the last minute.

01:01:19.500 --> 01:01:22.240
Oh. Never thought anything
could taste so good.

01:01:26.100 --> 01:01:27.199
Just hold me for a second, ok?

01:01:27.200 --> 01:01:29.000
I gotta make sure
we don't lose these ones.

01:01:29.001 --> 01:01:30.000
I got you.

01:01:30.001 --> 01:01:31.126
Ok.

01:01:32.300 --> 01:01:35.020
- You're done?
- Yeah.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:40.399
What is it?

01:01:40.400 --> 01:01:42.170
You are all right?

01:01:49.100 --> 01:01:50.550
Oh, my God.

01:02:00.300 --> 01:02:02.669
- I don't see it.
- Are you ok?

01:02:02.790 --> 01:02:03.892
I don't know.

01:02:08.900 --> 01:02:09.855
I'm bit.

01:02:09.900 --> 01:02:10.600
Oh, my God, honey.

01:02:10.601 --> 01:02:11.799
I'm bit.

01:02:11.800 --> 01:02:13.420
The fucker bit me.

01:02:13.601 --> 01:02:15.420
Ok, Hold on.

01:02:15.520 --> 01:02:17.490
I'm gonna look.

01:02:19.500 --> 01:02:22.908
Oh, God. It fucking hurts.

01:02:23.108 --> 01:02:24.583
Daniel, breathe, ok?

01:02:24.783 --> 01:02:26.075
Stay right here.

01:02:26.076 --> 01:02:29.166
I'm gonna look. Ok?

01:02:30.191 --> 01:02:31.873
I'm gonna go look.
You keep breathing.

01:02:31.901 --> 01:02:33.099
Daniel, listen to me.

01:02:33.100 --> 01:02:35.678
- I'm going to go look. You breathe.
- I'm breathing.

01:02:35.878 --> 01:02:40.300
Ok. Stay where you are.

01:02:40.301 --> 01:02:41.974
I can't see.

01:02:55.100 --> 01:02:58.206
My leg is still there, right?
I can feel it.

01:02:58.406 --> 01:02:59.538
Ok.

01:02:59.738 --> 01:03:01.062
It's all right, honey.

01:03:04.800 --> 01:03:07.400
You gotta put something on it.

01:03:07.401 --> 01:03:08.998
Ok. It's bleeding.

01:03:10.600 --> 01:03:12.500
It's bad, isn't it? It's bad.

01:03:12.501 --> 01:03:16.810
No. It's not that bad.

01:03:16.900 --> 01:03:18.400
Ok, I'm going to tie something around it.

01:03:18.401 --> 01:03:19.900
Just keep breathing for me, ok?

01:03:19.901 --> 01:03:21.499
I'm breathing.

01:03:21.500 --> 01:03:22.899
God, it fucking hurts.

01:03:22.900 --> 01:03:25.444
I'll put my weight belt
tethering around it. You wait.

01:04:04.200 --> 01:04:06.353
This can't be happening.

01:04:06.551 --> 01:04:08.675
How could this be happening.

01:04:08.676 --> 01:04:10.799
I got bitten by a shark.

01:04:10.800 --> 01:04:13.897
We could actually be
eaten alive by shark out here.

01:04:16.400 --> 01:04:19.772
We don't know anybody
who's ever been bitten by a shark.

01:04:20.201 --> 01:04:21.000
There are always three or four guys

01:04:21.001 --> 01:04:24.299
there on the shark show.

01:04:24.300 --> 01:04:26.900
Hey, it's all right. It's not that bad.

01:04:26.901 --> 01:04:28.899
It's going to be fine, ok?

01:04:28.938 --> 01:04:30.400
You are going to have
a nice scar to show your friends

01:04:30.401 --> 01:04:31.956
and that's it.

01:04:32.500 --> 01:04:33.950
Ok? Look at me.

01:04:33.951 --> 01:04:35.399
Look at me, baby.

01:04:35.400 --> 01:04:37.900
That's right. You are fine.

01:04:37.901 --> 01:04:38.750
You are not that bad.

01:04:38.751 --> 01:04:39.525
Just hurts right now.

01:04:39.526 --> 01:04:42.380
The salt water will make it get better

01:06:44.500 --> 01:06:47.200
It's ok. Just hold on.

01:06:47.201 --> 01:06:49.599
Just breathe.

01:06:49.600 --> 01:06:52.836
It's ok that it hurts.

01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:00.300
Oh, God. Something
is trying to get to my foot.

01:07:01.466 --> 01:07:03.539
It's a big one.

01:07:21.100 --> 01:07:22.930
I love you.

01:07:30.800 --> 01:07:34.510
Stay still. Stay where you are.

01:07:34.511 --> 01:07:38.100
It's gonna be ok. You hold on.

01:07:38.101 --> 01:07:39.299
You hold on, Daniel.

01:07:39.300 --> 01:07:42.174
You don't leave me out here, by myself.

01:07:43.401 --> 01:07:46.871
You promise me you'll hold on.

01:07:50.500 --> 01:07:53.584
- My leg!
- Daniel!

01:09:45.700 --> 01:09:49.803
Hello? Hello?

01:09:49.804 --> 01:09:52.481
It's the manager. Hello?

01:17:31.800 --> 01:17:34.247
- So what's the final weight on it?
- 2.13

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:46.581
Give me a knife.

01:17:54.300 --> 01:17:55.551
How's that?

01:17:56.801 --> 01:17:58.328
Good?

01:18:45.400 --> 01:18:48.267
That's what it ate.

01:18:53.560 --> 01:18:55.241
Check it out.

01:18:56.200 --> 01:18:59.192
Man, they really do eat anything.

01:18:59.887 --> 01:19:02.257
I wonder if it works.
