00:05.500 --> 00:08.730
* I don't ever want to feel *

00:08.800 --> 00:10.830
* Like I did that day *

00:10.900 --> 00:14.700
* Take me to the place I love *

00:14.760 --> 00:17.160
* Take me all the way *

00:17.230 --> 00:20.560
* I don't ever want to feel *

00:20.630 --> 00:22.100
* Like I did that day *

00:22.160 --> 00:24.100
* Take me to the place I lo... *

00:26.760 --> 00:29.200
Fellas, please.

00:29.260 --> 00:30.460
Penny, come on.

00:30.530 --> 00:33.200
We were just finding our sound.

00:33.260 --> 00:34.830
You found it.

00:34.930 --> 00:38.260
It's the sound of a cat
being run over by a lawn mower.

00:40.700 --> 00:41.630
I'm really very busy.

00:41.700 --> 00:43.000
Is there any way
that we can put this off

00:43.060 --> 00:45.060
until I have
more time to prepare?

00:45.130 --> 00:46.300
Of course.

00:46.360 --> 00:48.900
But, uh, you understand
my trepidation.

00:48.960 --> 00:49.800
What's that about?

00:49.860 --> 00:51.200
Not a clue.

00:51.260 --> 00:53.400
Can't we just postpone it
till the spring?

00:53.460 --> 00:54.960
Maybe next summer?

00:55.030 --> 00:57.030
This should be fairly
easy to deduce.

00:57.100 --> 00:59.230
He's holding the phone
to his left ear.

00:59.300 --> 01:02.130
Ears do not cross hemispheres,
so he's using the analytical

01:02.200 --> 01:04.200
rather than the emotional side
of the brain, suggesting that

01:04.260 --> 01:05.860
he has no personal
relationship with the caller.

01:05.930 --> 01:08.130
No, I didn't realize

01:08.200 --> 01:10.860
it had been so long.

01:10.930 --> 01:12.700
Sure, I guess
there's no other choice

01:12.760 --> 01:14.230
but to just go ahead and do it.

01:14.300 --> 01:16.330
He's referring to an
activity he has done before.

01:16.400 --> 01:18.430
It's unpleasant and
needs to be repeated.

01:18.500 --> 01:19.730
This suggests
some sort of

01:19.800 --> 01:24.000
invasive medical test,
like perhaps a colonoscopy.

01:24.060 --> 01:25.630
Aren't there any
other options?

01:25.700 --> 01:27.000
There's not a lot of room.

01:27.060 --> 01:28.260
It's gonna be uncomfortable.

01:28.330 --> 01:29.430
Yes, yes.

01:29.500 --> 01:32.600
I'm definitely going
with colonoscopy.

01:32.660 --> 01:34.660
Okay, bye.

01:37.630 --> 01:40.460
My mother's coming to visit.

01:42.260 --> 01:45.430
How about that,
you were right.

01:45.500 --> 01:49.030
* Our whole universe
was in a hot, dense state *

01:49.100 --> 01:52.330
* Then nearly 14 billion years
ago expansion started... Wait! *

01:52.400 --> 01:53.930
* The Earth began to cool *

01:54.000 --> 01:56.700
* The autotrophs began to drool,
Neanderthals developed tools *

01:56.760 --> 01:59.200
<i>* We built the Wall *
* We built the pyramids *</i>

01:59.260 --> 02:01.900
* Math, Science, History,
unraveling the mystery *

02:01.960 --> 02:03.800
* That all started
with a big bang *

02:03.860 --> 02:05.500
<i>* Bang! *</i>

02:07.000 --> 02:13.074
Advertise your product or brand here

02:14.330 --> 02:16.800
It's out of order.

02:16.860 --> 02:18.230
Yes, I can read the sign.

02:18.300 --> 02:20.260
I'm just pondering
the implications.

02:22.260 --> 02:26.300
I think it implies that
the elevator doesn't work.

02:26.360 --> 02:29.300
Again, I can read the sign.

02:29.360 --> 02:32.630
But the sign and the tape are
coated with a layer of dust,

02:32.700 --> 02:35.260
which indicates that the
elevator has been nonfunctional

02:35.330 --> 02:36.800
for a significant
amount of time.

02:36.860 --> 02:39.630
Which suggests either
a remarkable passivity

02:39.700 --> 02:40.830
among the, I assume,

02:40.900 --> 02:43.200
24 to 36 residents
of this building,

02:43.260 --> 02:44.800
based on the number of mailboxes

02:44.860 --> 02:47.460
and given typical
urban population density

02:47.530 --> 02:50.860
or a shared delusion
of functionality.

02:51.900 --> 02:54.700
You must be Leonard's mother.

02:55.860 --> 02:59.100
Oh, I don't know
if I must be, but yes.

02:59.160 --> 03:00.500
Uh, I'm Penny.
I'm his neighbor.

03:00.560 --> 03:02.200
Oh, Dr. Beverly Hofstadter.

03:02.260 --> 03:03.900
Oh, nice to
meet you.

03:03.960 --> 03:05.630
Oh, you're a hand shaker.

03:05.700 --> 03:08.060
Interesting.

03:09.130 --> 03:10.400
Uh, why don't you
come with me.

03:10.460 --> 03:12.160
I'll walk you to the apartment.
Oh, all right.

03:12.230 --> 03:15.330
Would you like to exchange
pleasantries on the way?

03:15.400 --> 03:16.660
Yeah, sure, I guess.

03:16.730 --> 03:18.160
All right, you start.

03:18.230 --> 03:20.000
Okay.

03:20.060 --> 03:21.330
You know,
I've always been curious.

03:21.400 --> 03:22.960
What was Leonard like
when he was little?

03:23.030 --> 03:24.260
Oh, I think
you mean young.

03:24.330 --> 03:26.630
He's always
been little.

03:26.700 --> 03:27.630
Right, okay.

03:27.700 --> 03:29.060
What was he like
when he was young?

03:29.130 --> 03:31.060
You'll have to be
more specific.

03:32.260 --> 03:34.260
Um, okay, like,
five or six.

03:39.160 --> 03:40.760
Five.

03:40.830 --> 03:43.030
Oh, well, at that age,
he was well enmeshed

03:43.100 --> 03:45.000
in what Freud would call
the phallic stage

03:45.060 --> 03:46.800
of psychosexual development.

03:46.860 --> 03:48.960
An outmoded theory, of
course, but the boy did spend

03:49.030 --> 03:52.000
most of his waking hours with
a tight grasp on his penis.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
Yeah, Leonard mentioned
you were a psychiatrist.

03:56.060 --> 03:57.360
Well, that is
one of my degrees.

03:57.430 --> 03:59.400
My primary field
is neuroscience.

04:00.460 --> 04:02.430
Well, I'm an actress.

04:06.500 --> 04:08.760
Why?

04:08.830 --> 04:11.330
What do you mean why?

04:11.400 --> 04:13.900
Well, there are studies that
suggest that many who go into

04:13.960 --> 04:17.760
the performing arts suffer from
an external locus of identity.

04:20.800 --> 04:24.730
Yeah, I don't know
what that means.

04:24.800 --> 04:26.530
Well, it means
you value yourself

04:26.600 --> 04:28.330
only as others value you,

04:28.400 --> 04:32.200
which is often the result of
unmet childhood emotional needs.

04:32.260 --> 04:35.760
Oh, well, I had a
wonderful childhood.

04:35.830 --> 04:37.830
Tell me about it.

04:40.000 --> 04:43.160
I know my dad
wanted a boy.

04:45.330 --> 04:47.400
I just, I tried
being good at sports,

04:47.460 --> 04:48.900
but I hated
getting dirty!

04:50.900 --> 04:52.960
And then, I'm assuming,
you entered adolescence.

04:54.330 --> 04:57.500
He called me Slugger until
I got my first training bra.

04:57.560 --> 05:01.530
And then he just stopped
playing catch with me.

05:01.600 --> 05:03.900
I wasn't Slugger anymore.

05:06.630 --> 05:08.000
Your mother's here!

05:13.600 --> 05:15.700
If you want to have intercoue
with that girl,

05:15.760 --> 05:18.630
find out what kind of cologne
her fathore.

05:21.460 --> 05:24.330
Good to see you, Mother.

05:25.700 --> 05:27.530
Here's your
tea, Mother.

05:27.600 --> 05:28.860
Oolong?
Yes.

05:28.930 --> 05:30.300
Loose, not bagged?
Yes.

05:30.360 --> 05:31.700
Steeped three minutes?
Yes.

05:31.760 --> 05:33.130
Two-percent milk?
Yes.

05:33.200 --> 05:34.560
Warmed separately?
Yes.

05:34.630 --> 05:35.860
One teaspoon sugar?
Yes.

05:35.930 --> 05:36.860
Raw sugar?
Yes.

05:38.900 --> 05:40.800
It's cold.

05:44.330 --> 05:46.730
G|G|
I'll start again.

05:46.730 --> 05:49.900
I  s

05:51.800 --> 05:54.530
My theory is that
his lack of focus

05:54.600 --> 05:57.830
stems from an over-
developed sex drive.

05:57.900 --> 06:00.000
Oh, I don't know
where he would've gotten that.

06:00.060 --> 06:03.100
Aside from a pro forma
consummation of our marriage,

06:03.160 --> 06:04.730
his father and I
only had intercourse

06:04.800 --> 06:07.500
for the purposes
of reproduction.

06:07.560 --> 06:11.300
That seems a fairly efficient
arrangement.

06:11.360 --> 06:12.700
Yes, we think so.

06:12.760 --> 06:14.130
We've both done papers on it.

06:14.200 --> 06:16.700
Mine from the neuroscientific
point of view

06:16.760 --> 06:18.830
and his from an anthropological.

06:18.900 --> 06:22.030
Mine, of course,
was the onlyne worth reading.

06:22.100 --> 06:23.530
Of course.

06:23.600 --> 06:26.860
I would very much like to read
about your sex life.

06:26.930 --> 06:29.530
Well, it's all online
or you can order it

06:29.600 --> 06:31.630
from the Princeton
University Press.

06:31.700 --> 06:34.700
Here's your
tea, Mother.

06:34.760 --> 06:36.400
So, what are you guys
talking about?

06:36.460 --> 06:40.030
The frequency with which
your parents had intercourse.

06:40.100 --> 06:42.960
Swell.

06:43.030 --> 06:44.460
If you're lucky,
maybe she'll show you

06:44.530 --> 06:45.930
the PowerPoint presentation.

06:47.060 --> 06:48.730
I'm sorry,
it's on my other laptop.

06:48.800 --> 06:50.430
Aw...

06:50.500 --> 06:53.060
So, Mother...

06:53.130 --> 06:54.560
what's new?

06:54.630 --> 06:56.130
You'll have to be more specific.

06:57.400 --> 06:58.430
All right.

06:58.500 --> 07:00.060
Uh, what's new with you?

07:00.130 --> 07:01.600
Oh, well, I've been having

07:01.660 --> 07:04.760
some fascinating
menopausal symptoms recently.

07:04.830 --> 07:07.300
Maybe something less personal.

07:07.360 --> 07:09.430
Oh.

07:09.500 --> 07:10.600
Your Uncle Floyd died.

07:10.660 --> 07:12.200
Oh, my God.

07:12.260 --> 07:13.230
What happened?

07:13.300 --> 07:16.700
His heart stopped beating.

07:16.760 --> 07:17.960
I have to urinate.

07:23.660 --> 07:26.860
What a remarkable woman.

07:26.930 --> 07:30.930
Yeah, I-I thought you guys
might hit it off.

07:31.000 --> 07:33.030
I envy you your childhood.

07:33.100 --> 07:35.460
I hate to tell you,
but the only warm memories

07:35.530 --> 07:39.430
I have of my childhood
are of my Uncle Floyd.

07:39.500 --> 07:41.030
You're clearly misremembering.

07:41.100 --> 07:42.130
Your mother is brilliant,

07:42.200 --> 07:43.230
analytical,
insightful.

07:43.300 --> 07:44.760
And I'm betting
she never hit you

07:44.830 --> 07:45.930
with a Bible because

07:46.000 --> 07:48.100
you wouldn't eat
your Brussels sprouts.

07:48.160 --> 07:51.360
Sheldon, you don't give
your mother enough credit.

07:51.430 --> 07:53.230
She's warm, she's loving,

07:53.300 --> 07:55.100
she doesn't glue electrodes
to your head

07:55.160 --> 07:59.000
to measure your brain waves
while potty training.

07:59.060 --> 08:00.530
You were lucky.

08:00.600 --> 08:02.360
When I was a kid,
if I wanted an EEG,

08:02.430 --> 08:04.900
I had to attach
my own electrodes.

08:07.760 --> 08:09.630
So, Dr. Hofstadter,

08:09.700 --> 08:11.060
Leonard rarely talks about

08:11.130 --> 08:13.960
his incredibly successful
brother and sister.

08:14.030 --> 08:15.630
Please, don't go
there, Howard.

08:15.700 --> 08:17.200
I understand that,

08:17.260 --> 08:19.830
unlike Leonard,
they're at the top

08:19.900 --> 08:22.600
of their respective fields.

08:22.660 --> 08:25.700
Boy, you suck.

08:25.760 --> 08:27.360
Well, Leonard's younger brother,
Michael,

08:27.430 --> 08:29.530
is a tenured law professor
at Harvard,

08:29.600 --> 08:30.800
and his sister just
successfully grew

08:30.860 --> 08:34.860
a human pancreas
in an adolescent gibbon.

08:34.929 --> 08:38.299
So, she's close
to curing diabetes?

08:38.360 --> 08:41.559
Why else would you grow
a pancreas in a teenaged gibbon?

08:41.630 --> 08:44.530
Wow, you must be very proud.

08:44.600 --> 08:45.530
Why?

08:45.600 --> 08:47.060
They're not my accomplishments.

08:48.130 --> 08:50.300
I have to urinate.

08:53.430 --> 08:55.630
Why are you doing this?

08:55.700 --> 08:56.800
You know the rules.

08:56.860 --> 08:59.530
You brought your mom to work...
you must suffer.

09:01.030 --> 09:02.300
Leonard, I had no idea

09:02.360 --> 09:04.800
your siblings were so much more
successful than you.

09:06.360 --> 09:09.430
Yeah, you're like the Jar Jar
Binks of the Hofstadter family.

09:11.460 --> 09:12.860
Oh, meesa think

09:12.930 --> 09:15.260
yousa lookin' so so sad.

09:17.130 --> 09:19.260
You know, rather than mock me,
my friends might realize

09:19.330 --> 09:22.160
that this is difficult
and try to help me through it.

09:22.230 --> 09:24.700
Nope, I think mocking you
is more fun.

09:26.060 --> 09:28.730
Next time, don't yousa
bring mama to work.

09:28.800 --> 09:30.760
Okee-day?

09:30.830 --> 09:33.260
That was fast.

09:33.330 --> 09:34.930
Oh, the middle stall
was occupied.

09:35.000 --> 09:36.460
I'll have to try again later.

09:37.760 --> 09:38.800
That's totally understandable.

09:38.860 --> 09:40.830
In bladder voiding,
as in real estate,

09:40.900 --> 09:43.630
it's location,
location, location.

09:43.700 --> 09:46.030
So, where were we?

09:46.100 --> 09:47.860
Howard lives with his mother
and Raj can't speak to women

09:47.930 --> 09:49.200
unless he's drunk.

09:49.260 --> 09:50.860
Go.

09:51.900 --> 09:53.330
That's fascinating.

09:53.400 --> 09:56.260
Selective mutism is quite rare.

09:56.330 --> 09:58.760
On the other hand,
an adult Jewish male

09:58.830 --> 10:00.260
living with his mother
is so common

10:00.330 --> 10:03.360
it borders on
sociological clich?.

10:05.060 --> 10:07.160
It's just temporary;
I pay rent.

10:07.230 --> 10:09.800
He lives in the same room
where his bassinet was.

10:09.860 --> 10:11.500
You know, both
selective mutism

10:11.560 --> 10:13.960
and an inability
to separate from one's mother

10:14.030 --> 10:16.260
can stem from
a pathological fear of women.

10:16.330 --> 10:17.830
It might
explain why

10:17.900 --> 10:20.530
the two of you have created
an ersatz homosexual marriage

10:20.600 --> 10:23.360
to satisfy your need
for intimacy.

10:30.630 --> 10:32.460
Say what?

10:33.660 --> 10:36.400
That's basically
what I just said.

10:36.460 --> 10:37.860
You brought your husband
to work.

10:37.930 --> 10:39.330
You know the rules.

10:41.360 --> 10:45.030
Meesa thinking yousa
looking pretty sad now
too, betcha, betcha.

10:45.100 --> 10:47.060
Leonard, it's 1:00.

10:47.130 --> 10:49.300
Weren't you going to show me
your laboratory at 1:00?

10:49.360 --> 10:50.660
There's no hurry, Mother.

10:50.730 --> 10:52.400
Tell them more about their
secret love for each other.

10:52.460 --> 10:54.200
But it's 1:00.

10:54.260 --> 10:56.560
You were going to show me
your laboratory at 1:00.

10:56.630 --> 10:57.660
Her reasoning is
unassailable.

10:57.730 --> 10:59.700
It is 1:00.

11:01.630 --> 11:03.330
Fine. Let's go.

11:05.030 --> 11:07.100
I think you'll find my
work pretty interesting.

11:07.160 --> 11:09.260
I'm attempting to replicate
the dark matter signal

11:09.330 --> 11:12.030
found in sodium iodide
crystals by the Italians.

11:12.100 --> 11:13.860
So, no original research?

11:13.930 --> 11:15.400
No.

11:15.460 --> 11:17.760
Well, what's the point
of my seeing it?

11:17.830 --> 11:20.630
I could just read the paper
the Italians wrote.

11:22.230 --> 11:23.960
Just for the record,

11:24.030 --> 11:27.100
we're not in an ersatz
homosexual relationship.

11:27.160 --> 11:28.830
Well, then why didn't
you say that to her?

11:28.900 --> 11:30.500
Why is it always my
responsibility?

11:30.560 --> 11:32.500
It's not always
your responsibility.

11:32.560 --> 11:34.360
I swear, this is the
same thing you did

11:34.430 --> 11:36.600
at the comic book store
last week.

11:39.830 --> 11:42.160
I can't believe you're
bringing that up.

11:43.500 --> 11:45.060
I didn't bring it up.
You did.

11:45.130 --> 11:47.330
We'll talk about
this later.

11:47.400 --> 11:50.100
You always say that,
but we never do.

12:04.130 --> 12:05.660
Hey.

12:05.730 --> 12:06.800
You got alcohol?

12:06.860 --> 12:08.130
Your mom still here?
Yep.

12:08.200 --> 12:09.800
Come on in.

12:11.360 --> 12:13.760
Wait, wait, she's not gonna come
here looking for you, is she?

12:13.830 --> 12:16.930
Relax. She took Sheldon to the
hospital to get a brain scan.

12:17.000 --> 12:18.930
Oh, my God. What happened?

12:19.000 --> 12:20.760
Nothing. Mother likes
looking at brains

12:20.830 --> 12:22.700
and Sheldon likes getting
his brain scanned.

12:25.160 --> 12:27.200
Geez, what a fun couple.

12:27.260 --> 12:28.960
She's only been here
a day and a half

12:29.030 --> 12:30.800
and I'm seriously
considering alcoholism

12:30.860 --> 12:33.260
as a new career path.

12:33.330 --> 12:35.060
Hey, I talked to her
for five minutes yesterday

12:35.130 --> 12:37.330
and I've been
half bombed ever since.

12:37.400 --> 12:40.300
You can't let her
get into your head.

12:40.360 --> 12:41.900
My head, what about yours?

12:41.960 --> 12:43.060
It's too late for me.

12:43.130 --> 12:46.500
My head is her summer house.

12:47.530 --> 12:49.260
She was right, you know.

12:49.330 --> 12:52.330
The locus of my identity
is totally exterior to me.

12:52.400 --> 12:54.830
Oh, yeah, there
she is. Hi, Mom.

12:56.900 --> 12:59.260
I mean, do you know where
I was all morning?

12:59.330 --> 13:01.030
Auditioning
with 50 other blondes

13:01.100 --> 13:03.630
for some stupid
antidepressant commercial.

13:03.700 --> 13:05.230
And for what?

13:05.300 --> 13:08.400
So I'll finally get
my daddy's approval?

13:08.460 --> 13:09.660
Did you get the part?

13:09.730 --> 13:13.230
No, they said I was too perky.

13:16.530 --> 13:18.900
You want to talk about not
getting love from a parent.

13:18.960 --> 13:20.760
You know what I used to
do when I was little

13:20.830 --> 13:23.330
to have some sensation
of human contact?

13:23.400 --> 13:25.860
Yeah, you grabbed your
penis and wouldn't let go.

13:30.730 --> 13:33.060
Your mother told me.

13:33.130 --> 13:34.330
Of course she did.

13:34.400 --> 13:36.000
Anyway, that's not
what I was gonna say.

13:36.060 --> 13:37.700
When I was ten years old,

13:37.760 --> 13:40.560
I built a hugging machine.

13:40.630 --> 13:42.730
A hugging machine?

13:42.800 --> 13:44.300
Yeah. I got a
dressmaker's mannequin,

13:44.360 --> 13:46.100
I stuffed it with
an electric blanket

13:46.160 --> 13:49.060
so it would be warm, and built
two radio-controlled arms

13:49.130 --> 13:52.200
that would hug me
and pat my back.

13:52.260 --> 13:54.230
Oh, that is so sad.

13:54.300 --> 13:56.330
You know what the
saddest part was?
What?

13:56.400 --> 13:59.230
My father used to borrow it.

14:02.330 --> 14:05.460
Your scan data will be very
helpful to my research.

14:05.530 --> 14:07.260
You have a remarkable brain.

14:07.330 --> 14:10.030
I know.

14:10.100 --> 14:11.960
Although I've always hated

14:12.030 --> 14:15.400
how my right frontal lobe
looks in pictures.

14:15.460 --> 14:17.300
Common complaint among men.

14:17.360 --> 14:19.530
Nothing's ever big enough.

14:19.600 --> 14:21.300
Except when they get a tumor.

14:21.360 --> 14:23.400
Then you never hear
the end of it.

14:23.460 --> 14:27.560
I'd love to see a scan
of your brain sometime.

14:27.630 --> 14:28.900
Oh, I'll send you a link,

14:28.960 --> 14:31.060
but its physiology
is fairly unimpressive.

14:31.130 --> 14:33.060
Oh, I can't believe that.

14:33.130 --> 14:35.500
Your unwillingness to accept
empirical evidence

14:35.560 --> 14:38.460
suggests an attempt
at flattery.

14:38.530 --> 14:41.130
My apologies.

14:41.200 --> 14:42.960
I've been living
with your son too long.

14:43.030 --> 14:45.160
Gotten into some bad habits.

14:45.230 --> 14:46.960
Understandable.

14:47.030 --> 14:50.400
Can I make you a cup of tea?
I doubt it,

14:50.460 --> 14:53.400
but if anyone has a chance,
it's probably you.

14:56.160 --> 14:59.300
I feel very comfortable
around you.

15:00.560 --> 15:02.760
I feel very comfortable
around you, too.

15:02.830 --> 15:04.160
It's surprising

15:04.230 --> 15:07.100
because I generally
don't feel comfortable around,

15:07.160 --> 15:09.500
well, anyone.

15:09.560 --> 15:11.430
Nor I.

15:11.500 --> 15:14.630
What are the odds
that two individuals

15:14.700 --> 15:17.330
as unique as ourselves
would be connected

15:17.400 --> 15:21.030
by someone as comparatively
workaday as your son?

15:22.060 --> 15:23.830
Is that a rhetorical point

15:23.900 --> 15:26.960
or would you like to do
the math?

15:27.030 --> 15:29.500
I'd like to do the math.

15:31.330 --> 15:34.060
I'd like that, too.

15:50.930 --> 15:52.430
Okay, now this time,
Uh-huh.

15:52.500 --> 15:54.730
you're gonna lick
the salt...

15:55.730 --> 15:57.100
off my neck...

15:59.160 --> 16:00.460
...do the shot...

16:02.600 --> 16:05.400
...and then bite the lime.

16:10.100 --> 16:13.830
I'm sorry, I didn't hear
anything after "lick."

16:13.900 --> 16:18.060
Neck, shot, lime.

16:26.230 --> 16:27.760
Okay, shot, lime.

16:27.830 --> 16:29.360
Right.

16:33.600 --> 16:36.000
Ah!

16:36.060 --> 16:37.130
Where's the lime?

16:41.530 --> 16:43.700
Oh, okay, we're sharing.

16:59.500 --> 17:03.300
So, what do you think?

17:03.360 --> 17:06.099
I'm very tempted.

17:06.160 --> 17:08.000
I'm just not sure
it's appropriate

17:08.060 --> 17:11.030
with my son's roommate.

17:11.099 --> 17:13.130
Normally, I'd feel
the same way.

17:13.200 --> 17:16.030
But based on everything
I've observed about us,

17:16.099 --> 17:19.859
I can't help but speculate
we'd be very good together.

17:19.930 --> 17:22.430
True. I've had
a similar observation.

17:22.500 --> 17:24.560
It's certainly something

17:24.630 --> 17:27.500
I could never do
with my husband.

17:27.560 --> 17:31.160
I was hesitant the
first time I tried it,

17:31.230 --> 17:34.060
but I experienced
an unanticipated

17:34.130 --> 17:37.630
and remarkable release
of endorphins.

17:39.160 --> 17:41.830
It's quite satisfying.

17:41.900 --> 17:43.530
I see what you're doing.

17:43.600 --> 17:44.860
You're appealing

17:44.930 --> 17:48.230
to the neuroscientific
researcher in me.

17:48.300 --> 17:52.230
You see right through
me, don't you?

17:52.300 --> 17:54.800
Only when you're in
a CAT scanner.

18:03.900 --> 18:07.130
This is actually
gonna happen.

18:07.200 --> 18:09.460
Honey, shush, shush,
shush, shush, shush.

18:09.530 --> 18:12.830
You shush, I'm happy.
I want to talk about it.

18:12.900 --> 18:14.560
You know what my mother
would say about this?

18:14.630 --> 18:16.830
She would say because you were
not loved by your father

18:16.900 --> 18:18.330
and I was not loved
by my mother,

18:18.400 --> 18:20.730
that having sex is our way
of making up for the intimacy

18:20.800 --> 18:22.000
we didn't get as children.

18:22.060 --> 18:26.000
Why would you bring
that up right now?

18:26.060 --> 18:27.630
I don't know.

18:27.700 --> 18:28.730
Foreplay?

18:28.800 --> 18:31.330
So you're saying

18:31.400 --> 18:33.760
you're not having
sex with me,

18:33.830 --> 18:35.600
you're having sex
with your mother?

18:37.600 --> 18:39.900
I'm gonna go with "no."

18:39.960 --> 18:42.500
That is the sickest
thing I've ever heard.

18:42.560 --> 18:43.860
Come on, you're trying

18:43.930 --> 18:47.460
to have sex with your father,
and I'm okay with that.

18:48.600 --> 18:50.500
Get out!

18:55.300 --> 18:57.830
She said shush.
I should have shushed.

19:01.800 --> 19:06.030
* Ooh, all night, all night *

19:06.100 --> 19:07.630
* Oh, every night *

19:09.500 --> 19:11.200
* Hold tight *
* Hold tight *

19:11.260 --> 19:13.730
* You hold tight *
* Hold tight *

19:13.800 --> 19:15.630
* Baby, hold tight *

19:15.700 --> 19:19.200
* Anyway you want it,
that's the way you need it *

19:24.100 --> 19:25.430
All right, Mother.

19:25.500 --> 19:27.030
Um, have a nice flight.

19:27.100 --> 19:29.660
That's not really in my control,
is it?

19:30.700 --> 19:33.030
Oh, uh, yes.

19:43.400 --> 19:44.260
Oh, good morning.

19:44.330 --> 19:45.560
Morning.

19:45.630 --> 19:47.800
Look, I was just coming
over to talk to you.

19:47.860 --> 19:48.830
You don't have to.

19:48.900 --> 19:50.530
Ever.

19:50.600 --> 19:52.630
Gotcha.

19:52.700 --> 19:53.660
Good-bye, Mother.

19:53.730 --> 19:55.030
Good-bye, Leonard.

19:55.100 --> 19:56.400
So, Slugger,
shall we pick up

19:56.460 --> 19:59.430
where we left
off last time?

19:59.500 --> 20:02.230
I mean, my mom
could've just said,

20:02.300 --> 20:05.160
"Bob, get over it,
she's a girl, move on."

20:05.230 --> 20:07.360
But she didn't.

20:07.430 --> 20:09.800
Not one word.
Interesting.

20:09.860 --> 20:12.230
Would you be willing to fly
to New Jersey and discuss

20:12.300 --> 20:15.900
your relationship with your
parents during a brain scan?

20:15.960 --> 20:18.530
Would it help?
Well, it would help me.
