00:13.760 --> 00:15.960
[in Pidgin] Death is death.
No matter how it comes.

00:16.040 --> 00:17.920
Kill me if you will.

00:18.000 --> 00:21.560
But do me a favor,
send my corpse to Warri.

00:26.080 --> 00:28.160
[whimpers] Akpos!

00:30.800 --> 00:31.920
[gunshot]

00:33.240 --> 00:35.640
[upbeat music playing]

01:36.400 --> 01:39.560
-Monika Lewinsky!
-Look at my friend!

01:40.280 --> 01:42.880
-Monika Lewinsky!
-Look at my friend!

01:42.960 --> 01:44.400
[all laugh]

01:44.480 --> 01:46.680
-Look at my friend!
-[in Pidgin] What's up?

01:46.760 --> 01:50.400
Look at my friend! What's up?

01:50.480 --> 01:52.960
Your house is beautiful.

01:53.040 --> 01:55.840
[both vocalizing]

01:55.920 --> 01:57.520
-Take it.
-Your father!

01:57.600 --> 01:59.640
-[laughs]
-Look at my friend!

01:59.720 --> 02:01.920
You've stylishly set yourself up.

02:03.960 --> 02:08.038
-What's up?
-Leave me alone. Do you want to beat me?

02:08.120 --> 02:12.560
You guys do so well in Lagos.
You do so well in Lagos.

02:12.640 --> 02:15.440
Look at this place.

02:16.040 --> 02:18.560
-Take it.
-Your father!

02:18.640 --> 02:20.040
[laughing]

02:21.040 --> 02:23.760
So you can't just tell your friend
that you've gotten an endorsement.

02:23.840 --> 02:24.840
Hmm?

02:25.600 --> 02:27.560
I didn't know you were married.

02:28.680 --> 02:31.240
And you didn't tell us back home.
When did you get married?

02:31.320 --> 02:32.640
Did you give me the husband?

02:34.720 --> 02:37.480
Monika, do you live in this house
all by yourself?

02:37.560 --> 02:43.120
Hmm. It's grape, not sugarcane.
Don't chew it recklessly.

02:43.200 --> 02:46.840
-Quit asking dumb questions.
-[chuckles]

02:47.840 --> 02:53.720
[chuckles] Your girlfriend...

02:53.800 --> 02:55.040
is pretty.

02:55.640 --> 02:56.880
Of course.

02:56.960 --> 02:58.520
[chuckles]

02:58.600 --> 03:03.240
She's my everything. This is Bianca.

03:03.840 --> 03:05.000
Bianca.

03:05.840 --> 03:10.200
Bianca is going to become
the next Queen of Nigeria.

03:10.280 --> 03:12.640
And I am her manager.

03:13.120 --> 03:18.040
With your carrot head.
What do you have to say?

03:20.240 --> 03:21.760
-[in English] Bianca.
-Hmm?

03:21.840 --> 03:25.120
-You are truly a very beautiful woman.
-Thank you.

03:25.200 --> 03:27.240
I'll make sure you don't have
any problems at all.

03:27.320 --> 03:32.120
-Akpos said you're very nice too.
-Of course I am. I mean... can't you see?

03:34.440 --> 03:37.840
You know, Lagos is for very smart people.

03:39.040 --> 03:41.960
And I see smartness
behind that beauty of yours.

03:42.920 --> 03:47.080
Like you, I came to Lagos
three years ago with nothing.

03:48.040 --> 03:50.400
Absolutely nothing.

03:51.560 --> 03:52.720
Look at me today.

03:53.760 --> 03:56.000
You've done really well for yourself
in three years.

03:56.080 --> 03:57.600
Mm-hmm.

03:57.680 --> 04:01.520
And if you stick with me,
this will certainly be your story.

04:03.280 --> 04:04.280
[Akpos] Monika.

04:04.360 --> 04:06.320
[chuckles] Monika, Monika.

04:06.400 --> 04:10.640
[in Pidgin] Hey, guy.
The name is now Monique.

04:12.400 --> 04:15.440
We won't be deceived
with this re-branding in Lagos.

04:15.520 --> 04:19.279
You know how we came up
with the name Lewinsky?

04:19.360 --> 04:22.880
[in English] Akpos, point of correction.
I mean, a point of direction.

04:22.960 --> 04:26.880
-[Akpos] Okay.
-My name is Monique, dude.

04:26.960 --> 04:28.440
[in Pidgin] No more Lewinsky.

04:28.520 --> 04:32.560
Let me tell my girlfriend about it.

04:32.640 --> 04:37.680
Bianca, you know how we came up
with the name Lewinsky?

04:37.760 --> 04:40.120
We caught Monika
inside an uncompleted building

04:40.200 --> 04:42.600
making out with our friend Igho.

04:42.680 --> 04:44.120
Making out?

04:44.200 --> 04:46.120
Put your tongue back in your mouth.

04:46.200 --> 04:48.480
-[all laughing]
-Put your tongue back in your mouth.

04:48.560 --> 04:51.640
A cat that swims is not a catfish.
You want me to show you the door?

04:51.720 --> 04:56.480
-[Akpos chuckles] Okay, I'm sorry.
-[babbling]

04:56.560 --> 05:03.520
Monique, we are here to register Bianca
for the Queen of Nigeria pageant.

05:03.600 --> 05:07.480
-Really?
-They sent us some information.

05:07.560 --> 05:09.080
[in English]
I'm certain you will win.

05:09.160 --> 05:15.440
[Akpos in Pidgin] Here's their address.
Can you take us there so we can register?

05:15.520 --> 05:17.000
Locate the address.

05:17.080 --> 05:18.640
I should take you there?

05:19.120 --> 05:20.720
Dude.

05:20.800 --> 05:23.560
You're always full of your empty self.

05:23.640 --> 05:24.680
[Bianca laughs]

05:24.760 --> 05:27.560
[speaking Pidgin]
You're always so full of yourself.

05:27.640 --> 05:28.720
Huh?

05:28.800 --> 05:34.320
There's something called a website
these days and you can register on it.

05:34.400 --> 05:36.800
[upbeat music playing]

06:08.280 --> 06:10.120
[in English]
Please, come with me.

06:10.680 --> 06:13.720
-I came with someone.
-She asked me to bring you in.

06:17.080 --> 06:19.480
[hip-hop music on TV]

06:21.440 --> 06:22.840
[thud]

06:24.760 --> 06:25.760
Ah...

06:25.840 --> 06:27.320
[chuckles]

06:29.600 --> 06:31.240
Welcome, welcome.

06:31.320 --> 06:32.360
How are you?

06:32.440 --> 06:33.680
Please, where is Monique?

06:34.400 --> 06:36.120
Monique. Come and sit down.

06:36.200 --> 06:38.760
You are beautiful.
You are beautiful.

06:38.840 --> 06:42.080
I should have believed her
when she told me that you were stunning.

06:42.160 --> 06:45.680
You are an epitome of beauty.
Sit down. Sit down.

06:46.520 --> 06:47.800
[chuckles]

06:48.880 --> 06:50.840
You see, I have...

06:51.680 --> 06:53.600
That's the way I like them:

06:53.680 --> 06:55.880
Young and pure.

06:56.240 --> 06:57.960
I'm coming.

07:01.960 --> 07:03.200
I'm coming.

07:06.840 --> 07:08.440
[cackling]

07:09.440 --> 07:11.720
-Here.
-Please, what's this for?

07:11.800 --> 07:12.840
Money.

07:12.920 --> 07:14.360
I don't want your money.

07:15.360 --> 07:16.560
See, let me tell you.

07:16.640 --> 07:20.200
People like me, have done the work
that people like you should be doing.

07:20.280 --> 07:21.600
[chuckles]

07:22.080 --> 07:23.200
Come.

07:23.280 --> 07:24.280
Ah-ah!

07:25.280 --> 07:27.520
I like them young and restless.

07:27.600 --> 07:29.200
The way you're going about this thing...

07:29.280 --> 07:30.280
Exactly.

07:30.360 --> 07:32.360
Ah! That is the way I like it.

07:32.440 --> 07:35.000
[laughs] The way you... That...

07:36.720 --> 07:38.480
Why are you running up and down?

07:38.560 --> 07:42.560
See, I don't have the energy of Terry G
to be running up and down and up and down.

07:42.640 --> 07:43.760
Uh-huh.

07:43.840 --> 07:45.600
Just keep it simple.

07:45.680 --> 07:48.000
I'm Mr. Easy.

07:48.080 --> 07:53.120
See, come. Just let this thing
revolve around your bum bum.

07:53.200 --> 07:56.000
[laughs] Come. Come. See...

-Monika! Monika!
-Dude, dude, it's Monique!

08:20.000 --> 08:21.480
[in Pidgin]
How many times do I have to tell you?

08:21.560 --> 08:23.240
Monika, your father.

08:23.320 --> 08:24.720
-Your father.
-Repeat it.

08:24.800 --> 08:26.960
May God punish that Monique name.

08:27.040 --> 08:28.680
You can be a monkey for all I care.

08:28.760 --> 08:30.400
Are you insulting me?

08:30.480 --> 08:32.799
-May God punish you, Monique!
-What?

08:32.880 --> 08:37.320
You think everyone
is a prostitute like you?

08:37.400 --> 08:39.039
May God punish you.

08:39.120 --> 08:41.640
God, please punish this man's mouth.

08:41.720 --> 08:44.320
This senseless fool...

08:44.400 --> 08:48.040
I don't have the time to talk to any goat
in yellow. Do you understand?

08:48.120 --> 08:53.280
I never knew.
I work very hard to make my money.

08:53.360 --> 08:55.560
Is that why you've tried
to prostitute my girlfriend?

08:55.640 --> 08:58.840
See this goat and his horns.

08:58.920 --> 09:04.720
Your girlfriend? Look at this idiot.
Did you not say you're her manager?

09:04.800 --> 09:06.760
And what difference does it make?

09:06.840 --> 09:09.640
Please don't spit in my eye.

09:09.720 --> 09:12.640
I cannot be moved by your threats.

09:12.720 --> 09:16.840
Look how you open your nose like a hippo.
Just look at this guy!

09:16.920 --> 09:22.400
Anyway, I don't have time
to argue with you. Do you understand?

09:22.480 --> 09:25.840
Before I close my eyes
and open them again,

09:25.920 --> 09:29.240
you and that senseless girl
should leave my house.

09:29.320 --> 09:30.920
Wait a minute.

09:31.000 --> 09:35.320
Is this what you call a house?

09:35.400 --> 09:38.520
A place you got through prostitution.

09:38.600 --> 09:39.640
Huh?

09:40.080 --> 09:41.680
No problem.

09:41.760 --> 09:44.880
If the both of you don't leave here
in two seconds,

09:44.960 --> 09:47.880
you will get whatever is coming to you.

09:47.960 --> 09:50.800
Wait. Is prostitution a job? Is this life?

09:50.880 --> 09:54.440
-Whore. Prostitute. Promiscuous woman.
-[Monique mutters mockingly]

09:54.520 --> 09:56.000
-Shameless.
-Look at you.

09:56.080 --> 09:57.240
You don't have a drop of shame.

09:57.320 --> 10:00.040
I've sold my shame
during the Warri crisis.

10:00.120 --> 10:02.240
-I don't care what you think.
-Take a look at your life.

10:02.320 --> 10:04.680
-Your father.
-Your real father.

10:09.080 --> 10:10.880
[knocking]

10:12.520 --> 10:13.760
[Akpos] Seyi!

10:13.840 --> 10:15.120
Who's that?

10:16.120 --> 10:19.280
[in Pidgin]
Seyi, it's your guy Akpos, from Warri.

10:19.360 --> 10:20.520
Akpos...

10:25.600 --> 10:27.160
What? Akpos!

10:28.200 --> 10:31.960
Seyi, long story.
I'll tell you everything, but please...

10:32.520 --> 10:36.160
-Man, life in Lagos is hard.
-[Seyi] Of course, what do you expect?

10:36.240 --> 10:39.920
[Akpos] Anyway, as I was saying,
I need some money desperately!

10:40.000 --> 10:42.600
Hmm. You need money?

10:42.680 --> 10:48.080
Uh, if you can hang on till next weekend,

10:48.160 --> 10:53.600
that's when I'm selling one of my kidneys
to some Malaysian mafia guys.

10:53.680 --> 10:55.800
So from there, I can raise funds.

10:55.880 --> 10:57.880
-Seyi.
-What is it?

10:57.960 --> 11:00.600
-Sell your kidney?
-You need to wake up.

11:00.680 --> 11:04.360
This is Lagos, understand?
It's the regular business we do here.

11:04.440 --> 11:07.160
Buying and selling.
It's called the "spare parts" business.

11:07.240 --> 11:11.840
Body organs, kidney,
liver, intestines.

11:11.920 --> 11:15.680
Do you think everyone you see
on the street has complete organs?

11:15.760 --> 11:16.760
[scoffs]

11:16.840 --> 11:20.440
Even I have only one kidney remaining.

11:20.520 --> 11:24.400
And that's the one
I'm selling next weekend.

11:24.480 --> 11:27.760
-Then I can gather some money for you.
-God forbid.

11:27.840 --> 11:33.040
Wouldn't you rather bet with NairaBet
on Arsenal versus Chelsea and win money?

11:33.120 --> 11:35.320
Kidney money is good money!

11:35.400 --> 11:37.000
Okay, I've heard you.

11:37.080 --> 11:39.960
Seyi, you will do me one favor.

11:40.040 --> 11:41.520
-What is it?
-Okay.

11:42.520 --> 11:45.040
You see my delicate beauty over there?

11:45.120 --> 11:49.280
-Sweet girl.
-Yes, exactly. But don't think about it.

11:49.360 --> 11:50.760
What's that supposed to mean?

11:50.840 --> 11:54.760
We all know you to be a rapist
in College of Commerce back then.

11:54.840 --> 11:58.000
-What is wrong with you? No, no, no.
-Bring your voice down.

11:58.080 --> 12:02.400
Okay, okay. Is it because
I let you into my house,

12:02.480 --> 12:05.040
you believe you are allowed to insult me?

12:05.120 --> 12:07.040
And you're even threatening me too.

12:07.120 --> 12:09.240
-Shh. Bring your voice down.
-Leave my house right now.

12:09.320 --> 12:11.760
I was only messing with you.

12:11.840 --> 12:18.040
You think you can just walk into my house
anytime you desire, huh?

12:18.120 --> 12:23.320
Maybe I should just throw you guys out
and allow the <i>agbero</i> to pounce on her.

12:23.400 --> 12:25.840
Then you'll know that you are better off
with me alone.

12:25.920 --> 12:28.000
-Bring your voice down.
-Leave my house right now.

12:28.080 --> 12:31.840
I was only messing with you.
What is wrong with you? Relax.

12:31.920 --> 12:36.520
I'm saying if anything happens to her,
you'll see my "red eye."

12:36.600 --> 12:38.200
Hmm.

12:38.280 --> 12:41.960
Look at his head.
Anyways, she's only here for the night.

12:42.040 --> 12:45.440
She'll be heading for the beauty pageant
camp before daybreak.

12:45.520 --> 12:48.920
I'll be timing you.
I'm watching the time.

12:49.000 --> 12:52.840
You're lucky I'm now born again,
or I would've taught you a lesson tonight.

12:52.920 --> 12:56.120
-[chuckles] Seyi, Seyi.
-What is it?

12:56.200 --> 12:57.840
-One more question.
-Hmm.

12:57.920 --> 12:59.840
When are you going
to improve your English?

12:59.920 --> 13:02.560
That's your business...

13:02.640 --> 13:04.800
[Akpos chuckles]

13:05.360 --> 13:08.240
[Akpos] Okay, zoom in.
Take a look, can you see the shape?

13:08.320 --> 13:11.440
We hear you are the stylists
providing for stars like Genevieve,

13:11.520 --> 13:13.320
Rita Dominic and Omotola.

13:13.400 --> 13:14.400
[in English] Correct.

13:14.480 --> 13:18.040
We also heard some of them can't afford
to buy clothes but for people like you.

13:18.120 --> 13:19.960
-[chuckles]
-Yes.

13:20.040 --> 13:24.040
That's the more reason,
I want you to style my girl.

13:24.120 --> 13:25.800
[chuckles, mutters]

13:25.880 --> 13:29.120
Bro, are you the one saying this?

13:29.200 --> 13:32.080
Eh? With your investment,
she'll be going places,

13:32.160 --> 13:35.160
and that includes you as a stylist.

13:35.240 --> 13:39.640
Trust me, when she will be
going around Africa,

13:39.720 --> 13:43.320
she will then be on CNN,
BBC, and "Al Jazebra."

13:43.400 --> 13:47.760
And guess what? All other designers
like Armani, Van Persie,

13:47.840 --> 13:49.720
Gucci, and Ronaldo, Louis Vuitton.

13:49.800 --> 13:50.800
They'll all envy you.

-Oh, you don't even know your colleagues?

13:54.360 --> 13:56.680
Listen, bro, I'm a world-class designer.

13:56.760 --> 14:00.120
And I design for top-class celebrities
like Agbani Darego.

14:00.200 --> 14:05.240
Listen to yourself, bro. Agbani Darego.
That means, "Agbani's reign is over."

The next queen in-line is Bianca Okamugba.
You can check her out.

She's such a beauty with untapped talent.

I see you're already checking her out.

If you are crowned Queen of Nigeria,

16:12.080 --> 16:16.440
what would you do to make better
this particular challenge?

16:18.240 --> 16:22.880
Human trafficking and sex trafficking
is modern-day slavery.

16:22.960 --> 16:24.960
Young girls are taken away
from their homes,

16:25.040 --> 16:26.480
away from their families.

16:26.560 --> 16:29.240
And their lives are literally
taken out of their hands.

16:29.320 --> 16:33.720
They are denied the opportunity
to choose and define their own future.

16:33.800 --> 16:37.200
This serious issue
is very, very close to my heart.

16:37.280 --> 16:40.720
And whether I am crowned queen
tonight or not,

16:40.800 --> 16:45.320
I dedicate my time to empowering
these young women

16:45.400 --> 16:48.400

in building their self confidence.

and you don't get to see the person
win the crown?

17:18.480 --> 17:23.760
What kind of wickedness is that?
Can't you talk? Are you a dummy?

17:23.839 --> 17:27.200

showing off your muscles, understand?

57:47.400 --> 57:49.360
What? I'm not Otunba.

57:59.280 --> 58:01.000
[photographer] All right,
ladies in the back...

58:11.280 --> 58:12.400
[Bianca] Where's Courtney?

58:12.480 --> 58:14.640
Forget about who's here.
Just face the mirror.

58:14.720 --> 58:15.880
I'm here to save you.

58:15.960 --> 58:19.360
If you want you and Akpos to live,
you listen to everything that I'm saying.

58:19.440 --> 58:20.640
Where is Akpos?

58:23.120 --> 58:25.400
Come on, bud, relax. Relax.

58:25.480 --> 58:27.600
Kim's got it under control.

58:27.680 --> 58:29.920
-You all right? Trust me, man.
-[mutters]

58:30.000 --> 58:32.560
But let me tell you something.
We gotta get out of here fast.

58:32.640 --> 58:34.000
'Cause once they realize she's missing,

58:34.080 --> 58:35.680
and they probably
already realized it by now,

58:35.760 --> 58:37.000
we're gonna have some company.

58:37.080 --> 58:38.360
So we've got to go, man.

58:39.000 --> 58:42.400
So you're gonna tell these people
you need to go to the toilet.

58:42.480 --> 58:45.200
-Okay.
-And head for the small bridge.

58:45.280 --> 58:49.160
Follow the exit signs. You'll find Akpos
and Ongime in a golf cart.

58:49.240 --> 58:51.680
-Who's Ongime?
-No time for questions.

58:52.840 --> 58:55.240
The guard is looking at me.
I can't go anywhere.

58:55.320 --> 58:57.440
Don't worry, I'll take care of the guard.

58:57.520 --> 58:59.160
-Okay.
-We have to be quick.

59:09.800 --> 59:11.320
I need to go to the toilet.

59:12.200 --> 59:14.040
[speaks foreign language]

59:14.120 --> 59:19.000
[in English] Hey. You look exactly
like Denzel Washington, look at you.

59:23.680 --> 59:26.680
-Akpos!
-No, no, no, no...

59:28.680 --> 59:31.800
Come on, y'all. This ain't no time
for lovey-dovey. We've gotta go.

59:34.280 --> 59:36.200
Look at your shoe size.

59:36.280 --> 59:38.800
You know what they say about a man
with big feet, eh?

59:38.880 --> 59:42.320
-Then told me what was going to happen--
-Holy shit! That's the wrong way.

59:42.400 --> 59:44.000
Wrong way!

59:44.080 --> 59:47.680
[mutters]
I think we can go with it.

59:48.280 --> 59:51.440
And if there are no objections,

59:51.520 --> 59:54.640
then we can roll with that.

59:54.720 --> 59:55.720
Cheers.

59:56.360 --> 59:57.360
Sir.

59:59.120 --> 01:00:00.520
[all clamoring]

01:00:00.600 --> 01:00:03.880
-[Bianca] I need my iPad.
-Okay, go get your iPad.

01:00:03.960 --> 01:00:07.040
Ooh! Careful, man. You need
to talk to your woman. This is crazy.

01:00:07.120 --> 01:00:10.600
Stop the cart! Stop it!
I'm going to get my iPad.

01:00:10.680 --> 01:00:12.680
-[Akpos] I'm not going to negotiate.
-Hurry up!

01:00:12.760 --> 01:00:15.320
Now, I've got an iPhone, an iPad,
and now I'm gonna die for Apple.

01:00:16.120 --> 01:00:19.880
[whispering]
Find her and bring her to me now.

01:00:22.120 --> 01:00:25.000
Gentlemen, this meeting is over.

01:00:26.240 --> 01:00:27.520
Excuse me.

01:00:30.520 --> 01:00:34.400
I swear to God,
you have a spell over you. Hurry up!

01:00:37.720 --> 01:00:38.920
Akpos!

01:00:44.400 --> 01:00:46.800
[inaudible]

01:01:01.840 --> 01:01:03.680
Bianca! Bianca!

01:01:07.200 --> 01:01:08.640
Hey!

01:01:20.960 --> 01:01:22.200
Hey!

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:24.680
[shouting, indistinct]

01:01:25.160 --> 01:01:28.480
Hey, damn, man, they got her.
We gotta go! We gotta go!

01:01:28.560 --> 01:01:30.560
I told you this was a bad idea.

01:01:39.440 --> 01:01:42.240
[gasping, wailing]

01:01:46.120 --> 01:01:47.840
Come on, move this thing!

01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:51.120
-How fast do you think it can go?
-Move this thing now!

01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:52.560
Don't yell at me. Don't you yell at me!

01:01:53.320 --> 01:01:54.760
Move faster, move faster.

01:01:56.600 --> 01:02:00.760
Bianca! Can you see
what an iPad has caused?

01:02:00.840 --> 01:02:02.720
-Move this thing!
-Don't you yell at me!

01:02:02.800 --> 01:02:05.720
I swear to God, I'll pull this cart
right over into a safari

01:02:05.800 --> 01:02:07.800
and let a lion tear your black ass up.

01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:16.520
-What is going on? Are we lost?
-[mutters]

01:02:16.600 --> 01:02:18.280
What the hell is wrong with you?
Turn around!

01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:23.000
You've got that way, that way, that way.

01:02:23.080 --> 01:02:24.680
How the hell am I supposed to know
where to go?

01:02:24.760 --> 01:02:27.920
-[speaking Pidgin] This side!
-No, no, no. That's the way we came from.

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.600
Hold on, man. Let me pull over.
I've gotta figure this out.

01:02:30.680 --> 01:02:32.920
Okay, we came this way. And...

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.040
Wait, wait. You passed this sign.

01:02:35.120 --> 01:02:36.440
-No, we came that way.
-No, no, no!

01:02:41.080 --> 01:02:43.040
Okay. Are you gonna look?

01:02:47.240 --> 01:02:49.920
-Akpos! Akpos! Akpos!
-Come on!

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.920
-There she goes.
-See there! Drive, drive. Go fast!

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:56.200
I can't go any faster!
You think you can go faster, then you run!

01:02:56.280 --> 01:02:58.840
Ah! [muttering]

01:02:58.920 --> 01:03:00.920
-Bianca! Bianca!
-I was kidding!

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:02.920
Bianca! Bianca!

01:03:04.160 --> 01:03:05.680
I was kidding!

01:03:05.760 --> 01:03:08.960
Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa! What are you doing?

01:03:09.040 --> 01:03:11.240
[panting] Bianca... Bianca!

01:03:11.320 --> 01:03:12.800
-Hey!
-Don't you talk to me!

01:03:12.880 --> 01:03:16.600
-What are you doing? I was kidding!
-Bianca! Bianca!

01:03:16.680 --> 01:03:19.640
Who do you think you are, Usain Bolt?
Get in, let's go!

01:03:19.720 --> 01:03:20.920
Bianca!

01:03:57.760 --> 01:04:00.200
Twenty-four hours? What the hell?

01:04:00.280 --> 01:04:02.720
Look, my girl was taken right before
my very own eyes

01:04:02.800 --> 01:04:03.920
and you're talking 24 hours?

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.040
Listen, we don't live here.
We're from Nigeria.

01:04:06.120 --> 01:04:09.440
I beg you in God's name.
Why do you need 24 hours?

01:04:09.520 --> 01:04:13.440
Wait, let me try.
Listen, you have to understand...

01:04:13.520 --> 01:04:17.280
What he's trying to say to you
is she could be dead in 24 hours!

01:04:17.360 --> 01:04:19.960
They're gonna kill her. What do you
want me to tell people back home?

01:04:20.040 --> 01:04:22.840
Man, come on, he ain't joining us.
We gotta do it on our own.

01:04:22.920 --> 01:04:25.240
Aren't you police? Can't you help?

01:04:25.320 --> 01:04:28.080
We gotta do this on our own.
He ain't going here. I know!

01:04:30.480 --> 01:04:31.760
[Bianca whimpers]

01:04:39.200 --> 01:04:40.560
Leave me alone.

01:04:44.120 --> 01:04:45.400
All I wanted...

01:04:47.040 --> 01:04:50.040
was your friendship. Hmm?

01:04:50.120 --> 01:04:53.520
And I tried to do it the gentlemanly way.

01:04:53.600 --> 01:04:55.480
But you had to ruin it.

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.800
Now, I am pissed off.

01:05:00.520 --> 01:05:06.200
And as if refusing my offer of friendship

01:05:06.840 --> 01:05:08.200
wasn't bad enough,

01:05:09.040 --> 01:05:14.520
you were actually trying to break
your business contract by running away!

01:05:14.600 --> 01:05:16.000
I wasn't running away.

01:05:16.080 --> 01:05:18.080
-Don't you lie to me.
-I wasn't running away.

01:05:18.160 --> 01:05:19.760
Don't you lie to me!

01:05:19.840 --> 01:05:24.520
Now, I'm willing to forget all of this,

01:05:24.600 --> 01:05:28.200
if you just take my offer of friendship.

01:05:29.680 --> 01:05:32.080
If it's friendship that you want,
then it's no problem.

01:05:32.160 --> 01:05:33.280
I can be your friend.

01:05:35.320 --> 01:05:38.120
Aww, sweet girl.

01:05:38.200 --> 01:05:40.920
She's such a sweet girl. Hmm?

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:42.520
[groans]

01:05:43.280 --> 01:05:45.520
[groaning]

01:05:51.440 --> 01:05:52.800
[Otunba shrieks]

01:05:54.360 --> 01:05:57.360
You... You will get ready.

01:05:57.960 --> 01:05:59.200
You will look pretty.

01:05:59.760 --> 01:06:04.160
You will attend the stakeholders' banquet,
okay?

01:06:06.440 --> 01:06:07.840
[Bianca laughs]

01:06:07.920 --> 01:06:10.040
What's funny now, hmm?

01:06:12.280 --> 01:06:15.240
-What are you laughing about?
-Akpos is a real man.

01:06:16.520 --> 01:06:20.960
And he knows exactly how to get his woman.
He's coming for me.

01:06:21.040 --> 01:06:24.640
Aww! He's coming for you.

01:06:24.720 --> 01:06:26.120
Oh, laugh all you want.

01:06:27.560 --> 01:06:30.920
You will never be half the man Akpos is.

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:36.320
Oh, but... Akpos is not coming.

01:06:36.400 --> 01:06:39.040
He has been taken care of.

01:06:39.120 --> 01:06:44.360
If you don't behave yourself,
you will also be taken care of.

01:06:44.440 --> 01:06:46.200
Now get her away from me.

01:06:47.680 --> 01:06:48.880
[Bianca cries out]

01:07:01.120 --> 01:07:04.920
[groans] Oh, Lord...

01:07:06.440 --> 01:07:07.800
[speaking Pidgin]

01:07:07.880 --> 01:07:10.440
[in English] You need to relax.
You need to have something to eat.

01:07:10.520 --> 01:07:13.240
Get some sleep.
You can't just be like this.

01:07:13.320 --> 01:07:15.960
You know my man is doing everything
to help you.

01:07:16.040 --> 01:07:18.240
-What else do you want us to do?
-[Ongime] Yeah, man.

01:07:18.320 --> 01:07:20.400
Write a placard and take it
to Otunba's place?

01:07:20.480 --> 01:07:22.240
Hashtag "bring back Bianca."

01:07:22.320 --> 01:07:26.160
Hey, Bianca's gonna be okay.
Come on, man. Man up, bro.

01:07:26.240 --> 01:07:28.000
It's gonna be all right. Trust me.

01:07:29.160 --> 01:07:31.960
I used to be in the military, man.
I know this stuff.

01:07:32.600 --> 01:07:34.400
That's the reason Otunba wanted me.

01:07:34.480 --> 01:07:35.720
Trust me. If he finds out I'm out,

01:07:35.800 --> 01:07:37.480
I promise you,
he's gonna be coming after us.

01:07:37.560 --> 01:07:42.600
My guys, with all due respect to the army,
all I want is Bianca.

01:07:42.680 --> 01:07:46.480
"Bianca, Bianca, Bianca."
Goddamn, come on, bro.

01:07:46.560 --> 01:07:49.120
It's gonna be all right.
You gotta believe, man.

01:07:49.200 --> 01:07:50.200
Come on!

01:07:52.800 --> 01:07:54.520
You'll get your Bianca back.

01:07:55.840 --> 01:07:59.200
-Please help me if you want to--
-Shh!

01:08:00.120 --> 01:08:02.720
[whispering] Get down, get down.

01:08:11.200 --> 01:08:13.920
Okay, we gotta stay down. We gotta move.

01:08:26.120 --> 01:08:28.120
Don't block my short road to freedom.

01:08:28.920 --> 01:08:30.800
[in Pidgin] Move this <i>madiba</i> from my way.

01:08:37.920 --> 01:08:40.120
[shouts] AK-47!

01:08:40.200 --> 01:08:41.479
Shh!

01:08:41.560 --> 01:08:45.760
Wait, wait. You can't use these.

01:08:45.840 --> 01:08:48.680
You see the guy with the bullet?

01:08:48.760 --> 01:08:51.840
[whispering, indistinct]

01:08:51.920 --> 01:08:54.520
Yeah, that's good. I need you to go
and find the bottles.

01:08:54.600 --> 01:08:56.800
Find yourself some bottles,
and draw their fire.

01:08:56.880 --> 01:08:58.600
-Okay? Yes!
-[whispering, indistinct]

01:09:00.359 --> 01:09:02.800

-I say, "Go to hell."

-I'll bust you--
-Wait, wait, wait.

01:11:17.640 --> 01:11:19.440
[in Pidgin] I haven't got time for this.

01:11:19.520 --> 01:11:21.720
He doesn't want to talk?
Let me tidy him up...

Guy. Guy?

What did he say?

01:11:30.560 --> 01:11:32.760
[in English] He said, "In his shit hole."

01:11:32.840 --> 01:11:33.840
Oh!

Okay, listen. This guy's got
some serious security.

01:12:37.560 --> 01:12:40.280

So here's the plan.

01:12:40.360 --> 01:12:41.840
I need you to go to the front, baby.

01:12:41.920 --> 01:12:44.000
I need you to just create
a distraction, okay?

01:12:44.080 --> 01:12:45.320
Why me?

01:12:45.400 --> 01:12:47.960
It's gonna be okay, baby. Listen.
Trust me, we're gonna be there.

01:12:48.040 --> 01:12:49.960
All right, now in the back,
there's a really low fence.

01:12:50.040 --> 01:12:52.240
You and I, we're gonna go in the back,
we're gonna jump over that fence.

01:12:52.320 --> 01:12:54.880
And then we have to blend in
with the crowd, okay?

01:12:54.960 --> 01:12:58.280
All right, the problem is... he has a dog.

01:12:58.360 --> 01:13:00.960
I don't even like doggy-style,
so I'm definitely going in the front.

01:13:01.040 --> 01:13:02.800
