00:19.707 --> 00:21.624
Wow!

00:23.124 --> 00:24.874
Happy New Year!

00:25.166 --> 00:26.916
Happy New Year!

00:49.249 --> 00:51.582
Do you know what that sound is?

00:52.124 --> 00:52.916
A party.

00:53.207 --> 00:55.166
That's the sound of mucking around.

00:55.499 --> 00:57.999
That's the sound of people
who don't have a plan.

00:58.291 --> 01:00.124
It's the first minute
of the New Year,

01:00.457 --> 01:04.331
and we're going to spend it
planning for the future.

01:04.666 --> 01:06.374
You're starting at
a new school this year.

01:06.707 --> 01:09.374
At lunchtime,
go and sit under a tree,

01:09.707 --> 01:13.499
read your books and
do some homework. Alright?

01:18.457 --> 01:20.166
Bring it!

01:27.416 --> 01:29.124
Bullrush!

01:31.499 --> 01:33.166
Whoa!

01:37.582 --> 01:39.291
Nah.

01:39.624 --> 01:40.166
Oh!

01:40.499 --> 01:42.666
And what?

01:43.291 --> 01:45.707
On your face!

01:50.207 --> 01:51.957
Oh yeah?

02:00.082 --> 02:02.207
Ooh!

02:03.249 --> 02:04.999
Oh, what a Ruthless!

02:05.291 --> 02:08.207
- Oh, he's a concuss!
- Stay away! Stay away!

02:08.541 --> 02:10.374
Far, I'm gonna tell my dad on you.

02:10.707 --> 02:12.416
Go, then.
I'll smash you and your dad.

02:12.749 --> 02:14.666
Oh!

02:16.082 --> 02:18.957
You need to sit here
and think about it, Ruth.

02:19.249 --> 02:22.749
That was totally
inappropriate behaviour.

02:28.666 --> 02:30.332
Shh. What's your name?

02:30.666 --> 02:33.541
- Hibiscus.
- What did you get in trouble for?

02:33.874 --> 02:35.541
Nothing.

02:35.874 --> 02:37.791
What's that taste like?

02:40.166 --> 02:42.082
Ew! Yum.

02:42.874 --> 02:44.791
You wanna be friends?

02:46.499 --> 02:48.374
When you're angry,
face the wall, count to 10.

02:48.707 --> 02:50.999
- One...
- ...two, three.

02:53.374 --> 02:55.374
Hey, boy. Is that your $2?

02:57.541 --> 02:59.416
- Yeah, that's mine.
- Liar, liar, pants on fire.

02:59.749 --> 03:00.416
- Ah, shame!
- Ooh!

03:00.749 --> 03:03.082
His pants were not on fire,
Ruth. Sit down.

03:03.416 --> 03:05.999
Miss, that's cos I put the fire out.

03:18.457 --> 03:19.916
- Nah, give it here!
- Nah, I can do it.

03:20.207 --> 03:21.082
You don't even know!

03:21.416 --> 03:22.999
- Oh, my eye! Argh!
- Sit down.

03:23.291 --> 03:25.999
His eye walked into my whip, Miss.

03:26.707 --> 03:28.374
Nah, I got you.

03:28.707 --> 03:32.124
From now on,
I'm gonna call you Biscuits.

03:32.499 --> 03:34.374
Thank you.

03:34.707 --> 03:35.999
You wanna be best friends?

03:38.791 --> 03:41.207
Yeah-yah! I'm at your house.

03:44.291 --> 03:45.999
Thank you so much for letting
Ruth come around.

03:46.332 --> 03:48.374
Hibiscus has been
an amazing influence.

03:48.707 --> 03:50.249
Oh. Great.

03:50.582 --> 03:55.041
Hey, Biscuits, do you know
what a divorce is?

03:55.499 --> 03:58.166
So do I. So, what do you do for fun?

03:59.499 --> 04:00.916
Brush, brush, brush.

04:01.207 --> 04:03.374
Shake, shake, shake.
Take it. Take it.

04:03.707 --> 04:05.374
Take it!

04:05.707 --> 04:08.999
Read the instructions carefully.
You have 30 minutes.

04:09.332 --> 04:12.666
- Biscuits, what is this?
- It's fun. Easy.

04:14.166 --> 04:16.082
Just keep trying.

04:17.082 --> 04:19.207
# Boo #

04:19.541 --> 04:23.041
As you know, nothing at all is
coming out at the bottom.

04:25.707 --> 04:28.166
From the table or even when you're
walking in front of anybody-

04:28.499 --> 04:29.249
tulou.

04:36.332 --> 04:39.416
From left to right or right
to left-any way, it's good.

04:42.416 --> 04:43.999
Hey, Biscuits.

04:44.291 --> 04:46.207
Come on.

04:47.749 --> 04:49.999
Oh, Ruth, you're so funny.

04:55.791 --> 04:57.916
You can set
a record, Biscuits.

04:58.207 --> 05:00.291
- Can you not? This is important.
- Ah, so is this.

05:00.624 --> 05:04.499
- A'e? OK, let's go.
- Mmm.

05:05.082 --> 05:06.999
This is for my Island girl,

05:07.332 --> 05:09.499
Pasifika's finest pearl.

05:10.166 --> 05:12.416
You're the only one I see...

05:12.749 --> 05:13.999
Ow!

05:14.291 --> 05:16.207
Ooh, Bachelor Of Engineering,
four years.

05:16.541 --> 05:20.041
I'm leaning towards a major
in software. What about you?

05:20.374 --> 05:22.374
Um, I'll just do whatever you do.

05:22.707 --> 05:25.791
No, don't just copy me.
What do you wanna be?

05:26.082 --> 05:27.832
Uh, pretty.

05:28.124 --> 05:31.082
- Uh, mission accomplished.
- Ruth, I'm serious.

05:31.416 --> 05:34.249
Well, do engineers
make good money?

05:34.582 --> 05:37.499
- Yes.
- Oh. Engineering it is.

05:38.124 --> 05:39.999
You're the only one I see.

05:40.291 --> 05:43.082
You're the only teine
in the world.

06:11.541 --> 06:14.416
- Hey!
- Hey.

06:14.749 --> 06:16.499
You know you're the hottest girl
in the club, right?

06:16.832 --> 06:18.749
I know.

06:20.291 --> 06:22.999
Do you know I'm gonna
buy you a drink?

06:23.291 --> 06:25.416
Do you know what time it is?

06:27.082 --> 06:28.999
Later, he.

06:29.749 --> 06:31.791
What about the countdown?

06:55.541 --> 06:59.166
This is an important year,
your final year at university.

06:59.499 --> 07:03.124
And for you, Hibiscus,
what's the main rule?

07:03.707 --> 07:06.082
No going out and no boyfriends.

07:06.416 --> 07:08.999
Hey, those are the rules
that got you this far.

07:09.291 --> 07:11.999
Don't break them or I'll break you.

07:12.291 --> 07:13.999
- Oh!
- Shh.

07:14.332 --> 07:16.624
Here's to a successful year.

07:18.082 --> 07:19.832
- Hear, hear!
- Cheehooo!

07:22.166 --> 07:24.249
- Good job.
- That is so hot.

07:28.291 --> 07:32.332
Your final year project will not be
graded, simply a pass or fail.

07:32.666 --> 07:36.332
An extension will only be granted
in exceptional circumstances.

07:36.666 --> 07:39.957
Fail to do this,
and you will not graduate.

07:40.249 --> 07:44.332
Every year without fail, we'll have
someone in our office crying.

07:44.666 --> 07:46.124
Don't let it be you.

07:46.457 --> 07:47.999
You'll be working
in a group situation,

07:48.291 --> 07:50.332
so choose your group wisely.

07:50.666 --> 07:54.457
Are you wearing a cape?
You look pretty stupid.

07:56.416 --> 07:58.999
I can always take the cape off.
Can you do that with your face?

07:59.332 --> 08:02.666
- Ruth, soia.
- What? Shots fired.

08:09.666 --> 08:12.416
OK. Preferred topics,
one for one. Go.

08:12.749 --> 08:15.082
You know how toilets have
a full flush and a half flush?

08:15.416 --> 08:16.999
- Mm.
- I'm looking at a mechanism that

08:17.332 --> 08:19.791
can bring a quarter flush
for pee-pee to save water

08:20.082 --> 08:23.332
and double flush where
you need extra clearance.

08:23.666 --> 08:26.791
I'm thinking automated mapping
of pedestrian traffic

08:27.082 --> 08:30.957
for traffic-crossing optimisation.

08:31.249 --> 08:32.832
I'm thinking impact
measurement on skulls

08:33.124 --> 08:35.082
so I can punch people
in the head for science.

08:35.416 --> 08:36.416
- That's too broad.
- Nah, you're broad.

08:36.749 --> 08:39.416
Software that provides a report on
your cell phone use during the day.

08:39.749 --> 08:41.999
- Squashing bugs is boring.
- Well, do you have a better idea?

08:42.332 --> 08:46.416
Uh, yeah. Food-cooking thing
that improves food cooking.

08:46.749 --> 08:48.416
- I'm thinking...
- Mm?

08:48.749 --> 08:50.874
...a productivity necklace.

08:51.166 --> 08:52.916
- What?
- A productivity necklace.

08:53.207 --> 08:55.207
It gives a short electric
shock every 10 minutes,

08:55.541 --> 08:58.082
safe enough not to break skin.
It's a psychological reset.

08:58.416 --> 09:00.291
How's this S&M bracelet
gonna benefit society?

09:00.624 --> 09:02.874
- What's S&M?
- Sausage and mince.

09:03.166 --> 09:04.791
- Test demographic?
- University students.

09:05.082 --> 09:06.082
- Budget?
- Keep it achievable.

09:06.416 --> 09:07.541
Gift vouchers and curiosity, eh?

09:07.874 --> 09:10.207
Secondary option will be automated
traffic.

09:11.666 --> 09:14.499
Done. I will write it up. Can you
give me a lift after my work?

09:14.832 --> 09:16.416
- Can I have dinner at your house-?
- Deal.

09:16.749 --> 09:20.082
...and use your power and
your water? Oh, Biscuits.

09:20.416 --> 09:22.332
Hey, you forgot your...

09:26.332 --> 09:28.249
Good job, Ruth.

09:39.624 --> 09:43.082
Stop mucking around,
you fullas. Come on.

09:44.332 --> 09:46.541
Hey. How was your New Year's?

09:46.874 --> 09:48.791
- Quiet.
- Oh yeah. Me too.

09:49.082 --> 09:51.791
- What did you get up to?
- Oh, just chilled at home.

09:52.082 --> 09:54.374
- Oh yeah. Whereabouts do you live?
- Like, just down the road.

09:54.707 --> 09:55.791
Oh, so it's, like,
walking distance from here?

09:56.082 --> 09:57.166
Yeah. Yeah, pretty much.

09:57.499 --> 09:58.957
Oh, that must be so handy
when you finish late.

09:59.249 --> 10:00.332
- Yeah.
- It's really dangerous for me,

10:00.666 --> 10:02.291
and it's already dark by
the time we finish, and so-

10:02.624 --> 10:07.374
Yeah, you should try catching
a cab. Yeah. Real reliable.

10:09.707 --> 10:11.957
- Hey, we should go get a drink.
- Yeah, sounds good.

10:12.249 --> 10:13.457
Hibiscus, are you keen?

10:13.791 --> 10:15.541
No, thanks. My ride
should be here soon.

10:15.874 --> 10:17.957
- She's not keen.
- Wait. Did someone say drinks?

10:18.249 --> 10:19.791
- No, let's go.
- We didn't include youse.

10:20.082 --> 10:21.832
It's just the girls.

10:22.124 --> 10:24.041
We could go back
to your house, eh, Anthony?

10:24.374 --> 10:27.791
Hey, important question-
what did your mum make for dinner?

10:28.082 --> 10:28.749
Eh.

10:34.082 --> 10:36.124
Man, your mum can be eats.

10:39.082 --> 10:39.541
Why do I need to?

10:41.166 --> 10:43.457
When I was her age,
I was a size 10 too, eh?

10:53.291 --> 10:54.749
Oh, no, I'm too tire-

10:56.541 --> 10:58.791
I didn't even need to run.
You need to run.

10:59.082 --> 11:00.124
- You want a hiding?
- Yes.

11:00.457 --> 11:02.832
- Come on.
- What, build ups, huh?

11:03.124 --> 11:05.124
Build ups?

11:09.082 --> 11:10.374
Hey, can you help me with ipu ki
this afternoon?

11:10.707 --> 11:12.999
What is it this time?

11:13.291 --> 11:15.791
- Do you know my cousin Luisa?
- Yeah.

11:16.082 --> 11:17.416
Yeah, well, she's getting married.

11:17.749 --> 11:20.082
My auntie asked my mum to help
her organise it, which means

11:20.416 --> 11:23.291
I'm gonna organise it, and by
helping, she means I do all of it.

11:23.624 --> 11:25.791
Stink. Is it a...?

11:26.082 --> 11:29.166
Pretty much.

11:29.541 --> 11:30.999
You should just get
someone else to do it.

11:31.291 --> 11:35.082
No one in the family wants to do it.
Anyone else would just stuff it up.

11:35.416 --> 11:36.707
- Hibiscus!
- Ooh!

11:52.624 --> 11:53.874
But we have to cut it down to 200.

11:54.166 --> 11:55.999
We can't afford 300
at the reception.

11:57.249 --> 11:58.541
Then you need to cut down
some of yours.

11:58.874 --> 12:00.124
- Hey, cuz.
- Hey, cuz.

12:00.457 --> 12:03.291
Oh, thanks. Sorry to do
those last-minute ones.

12:05.416 --> 12:06.541
She's been on my case all week.

12:06.874 --> 12:10.791
I got you. Just try and relax.
It's your special day.

12:11.082 --> 12:13.041
They want a big wedding,
but money's gonna come from where?

12:13.374 --> 12:14.457
I don't want people to mock us.

12:14.791 --> 12:17.249
- It's not about them.
- Easy. I got you.

12:17.582 --> 12:20.124
I'm so glad I've
got my on-to-it cuz...

12:20.457 --> 12:21.332
...his family
are useless.

12:21.666 --> 12:23.207
- Oh, just hurry up.

12:23.541 --> 12:25.457
No problem.

12:35.082 --> 12:35.499
Hibiscus.

12:35.832 --> 12:37.332
Yes, I've got a plan and a schedule.

12:37.666 --> 12:41.124
Stick to it and everything
will turn out fine.

12:41.457 --> 12:42.916
Firstly, we will lock down
your wedding dress.

12:43.207 --> 12:45.874
We've borrowed a couple, but we will
find something that you like.

12:46.166 --> 12:47.332
I really like this one.

12:47.666 --> 12:48.999
No one would even know
you're pregnant.

12:49.332 --> 12:51.166
Except everyone at your wedding
is from your church,

12:51.499 --> 12:53.291
and they gossip to the days.

12:53.624 --> 12:54.999
True.

12:55.332 --> 12:56.541
Next, we will take
care of your lineup.

12:56.874 --> 12:58.916
So, I was thinking we should
have 15 in each of our lineups,

12:59.207 --> 13:02.916
you know, like two rugby teams.
Cos you know I was first 15.

13:03.207 --> 13:05.124
- You know, like a metaphor.
- Like a stupid.

13:05.457 --> 13:06.332
No, but if we can pay
for the clothes as our-

13:06.666 --> 13:08.166
Yeah, nah, that's not gonna happen.

13:08.499 --> 13:10.374
- Sad.
- What's your budget?

13:10.707 --> 13:12.541
We got, like, 2000.

13:12.874 --> 13:16.957
Uh, OK. Maid of honour and best man.
Everyone else, thank you.

13:17.249 --> 13:19.791
Goodbye. Don't have a cry!

13:20.082 --> 13:21.999
After the service, we'll stay local,

13:22.291 --> 13:23.999
and I'm giving you
one hour for photos.

13:24.332 --> 13:27.166
You want us to take our photos here?

13:30.582 --> 13:32.124
That's where we used to
hang out heaps, eh?

13:32.457 --> 13:35.791
- You guys like the photos?
- Yeah. We love them.

13:36.082 --> 13:37.332
Cool. Moving on.

13:37.666 --> 13:40.999
The reception will be in a school
hall to save money, 3.15pm start-

13:41.291 --> 13:42.791
no Island time.

13:43.082 --> 13:47.332
Minister opens with a prayer,
then we serve the food.

13:47.666 --> 13:50.874
- How many people are we expecting?
- 300.

13:51.166 --> 13:51.791
200.

13:52.082 --> 13:53.791
I don't wanna leave people out
and piss them off.

13:54.082 --> 13:55.041
Make it 200.

13:58.457 --> 13:59.124
Uh...

14:02.249 --> 14:03.207
We can ask people to bring a plate.

14:12.749 --> 14:16.207
Hibiscus, this is your
problem. Solve it.

14:27.791 --> 14:32.999
We can't have it catered, so
we are going to cook it ourselves.

14:33.291 --> 14:36.624
- Ruth, you're gonna help me.
- Oh, come on!

14:39.791 --> 14:40.791
Yes, please.

14:49.124 --> 14:52.249
We will give them
something to talk about.

14:52.582 --> 14:54.124
We are going to serve
seven small dishes.

14:54.457 --> 14:55.082
That's not going to be enough.

14:55.416 --> 14:59.041
Only if we serve it buffet-style,
so we are going a la carte-style.

14:59.374 --> 15:01.207
Oh, you fancy.

15:01.541 --> 15:04.957
It gives us portion control rather
than everyone making mountains.

15:05.249 --> 15:05.791
We'll have...

15:16.332 --> 15:18.791
People won't be happy at first.

15:28.207 --> 15:30.166
We weather the hate,
and they'll be surprised

15:30.499 --> 15:35.999
that they get their fill from
smaller but more numerous portions.

15:43.082 --> 15:45.916
After that, we'll have
the cutting of the cake.

15:46.207 --> 15:47.957
Luisa's Siva Samoa.

15:48.249 --> 15:50.291
The newlyweds' first dance.

15:56.124 --> 15:58.291
And then we'll only have two items-

15:58.624 --> 16:01.707
one from the girls
on the bride's side.

16:16.499 --> 16:18.374
OK. From the groom's side,
what did you guys wanna do?

16:18.707 --> 16:20.249
Oh, we're just gonna do, like,
a little dance thing.

16:20.582 --> 16:23.124
- Sounds dry-balls.
- It's like a Magic Mike.

16:23.457 --> 16:25.791
Oh. Well, let's see it
before we judge it.

16:26.082 --> 16:27.124
It's a family show.

16:27.457 --> 16:30.416
Not too much magic;
just a little bit.

16:53.291 --> 16:55.249
A agi le matagi, agi e agi e,

16:55.582 --> 16:57.957
Agi a luga, agi a lalo,
agi a folau ai.

16:58.249 --> 17:00.374
A agi le matagi, agi e agi e,

17:00.707 --> 17:02.999
Agi a luga, agi a lalo, agi a-

17:10.624 --> 17:12.540
Shake it.

17:14.665 --> 17:16.790
This is for my Island girl.

17:17.082 --> 17:19.207
Gonna make your body twirl.

17:20.082 --> 17:24.457
I'm gonna make you feel that
you're the only teine in the world.

17:24.790 --> 17:29.416
Of all of the other ladies,
you're the only one that...

17:31.832 --> 17:34.124
Minister closes with a prayer,
be done by 4.30,

17:34.457 --> 17:36.374
and then start the cleanup.

17:36.707 --> 17:38.916
Hey, Mum. What did you think?

17:39.207 --> 17:42.999
Good. It's done. Make sure you clean
up properly so we can get the bond.

17:43.332 --> 17:46.082
I'm leaving. I'll see you at home.

17:47.082 --> 17:48.207
OK. Can you guys
move all the chairs-?

17:48.541 --> 17:50.166
- Hey. Awesome organising.
- Thanks.

17:50.499 --> 17:52.541
I've never been to an
Island wedding that's...

17:52.874 --> 17:54.457
- On time?
- Yeah.

17:54.791 --> 17:56.791
- Can you guys-?
- Achieved the impossible.

17:57.082 --> 17:59.457
- Do you do this for a living?
- No, I'm at uni, just final year.

17:59.791 --> 18:01.832
Just doing it as a family favour.
Can you move all the-?

18:02.124 --> 18:06.124
True. I'm at uni too, doing conjoint
- commerce and law. What about you?

18:06.457 --> 18:09.166
- Engineering, majoring in software.
- Hey, you skux guy.

18:09.499 --> 18:11.374
- Hey.
- What's your handle?

18:11.707 --> 18:13.791
- Charlie.
- Got a girlfriend?

18:14.082 --> 18:15.791
What? Uh, no.

18:16.082 --> 18:17.999
Oh. Later, bo.

18:22.332 --> 18:23.874
How many people
were at the reception?

18:24.166 --> 18:25.791
About 300.

18:26.082 --> 18:27.916
When do you have to
settle the invoice?

18:28.207 --> 18:30.332
- Do we have to pay for it?
- Ae a.

18:30.666 --> 18:32.874
How much is in your
faalavelave account?

18:33.166 --> 18:34.332
- About 1500.
- Huh?

18:34.666 --> 18:36.582
About 1500.

18:37.207 --> 18:39.791
OK. Use that,
and I'll cover the rest.

18:40.082 --> 18:41.999
OK.

18:42.624 --> 18:43.374
What's your plan for the week?

18:43.707 --> 18:45.124
Just a future graduates' evening,

18:45.457 --> 18:47.999
where we have to meet
prospective employers.

18:48.291 --> 18:50.416
So... what are you wearing?

18:57.832 --> 18:59.832
No. What else do you have?

19:01.082 --> 19:02.332
Um, I have that, um...

19:03.666 --> 19:04.999
Why don't you have
any business clothes?

19:06.541 --> 19:07.916
You dress for the job you want.

19:08.207 --> 19:10.082
That's not wasting money-
that's an investment, huh?

19:10.416 --> 19:11.541
How much have you put
aside for clothing?

19:11.874 --> 19:13.041
I haven't budgeted anything.

19:13.374 --> 19:16.541
Oh? So you haven't
planned properly, then.

19:16.874 --> 19:19.624
Wear something from my wardrobe.

19:23.666 --> 19:25.041
- What is-?
- Don't.

19:25.374 --> 19:27.291
OK.

19:28.082 --> 19:30.124
- That Charlie guy from the wedding.
- Who?

19:30.457 --> 19:32.124
The one your mum
snapped you staring at.

19:32.457 --> 19:34.041
Shame.

19:34.374 --> 19:36.207
Eventually, your mum
will set you free.

19:36.541 --> 19:39.999
She's one of those ones-
no boyfriend, no boyfriend.

19:40.291 --> 19:42.874
And then I finish uni,
and then it's...

19:43.166 --> 19:45.332
...'Why don't
you have a husband?'

19:45.666 --> 19:47.791
True. Hey, but Mum's right.

19:48.082 --> 19:49.082
Don't grease up-
she can't hear you.

19:49.416 --> 19:50.791
Luisa had to put
her studies on hold.

19:51.082 --> 19:52.457
So you're saying that I'm gonna
be next in one of your-?

19:52.791 --> 19:55.374
- No. I'm saying Mum is looking out.
- I know that, but-

19:55.707 --> 19:59.166
- You thirsty. Hmm? You hungry.
- No.

19:59.499 --> 19:59.916
No.

20:00.207 --> 20:01.874
It's OK-women cannot
live on carbs alone.

20:02.166 --> 20:02.999
Uh, can you not?

20:03.291 --> 20:04.791
Are you saying guys
are asking you out now?

20:05.082 --> 20:06.999
No.

20:07.499 --> 20:09.249
Yes. Maybe.

20:09.582 --> 20:10.791
So if they ask you out, just say no.

20:11.082 --> 20:12.124
But what if they're, like, the one?

20:12.457 --> 20:13.374
- Why would they be the one?
- You never know.

20:13.707 --> 20:15.041
It's not your job to be
looking out for the one.

20:15.374 --> 20:16.999
- If opportunity knocks-
- ...then you get knocked up.

20:17.332 --> 20:17.791
Not even.

20:18.082 --> 20:19.082
Before that,
your mum will knock you out.

20:19.416 --> 20:22.207
- I can take her.
- Oh yeah?

20:24.582 --> 20:25.416
- Oh my gosh!
- Biscuit said she's gonna-

20:25.749 --> 20:26.916
- Shh!
- ...smash your face!

20:27.207 --> 20:29.791
- I was just joking.
- Brave with your buildup.

20:30.082 --> 20:32.207
OK. You're right.

20:33.499 --> 20:35.332
- I will need your help, then.
- Why me?

20:35.666 --> 20:37.999
- Because you're, like-
- Choose words wisely.

20:38.291 --> 20:39.541
- ...experienced.
- True.

20:39.874 --> 20:43.999
I know all the things, Biscuits.
I chase down all the waterfalls.

20:44.332 --> 20:46.791
Like when I went out with
that guy with the flash car,

20:47.082 --> 20:48.541
who still argues with his dad
for petrol money.

20:48.874 --> 20:50.541
She's waiting. Please. Please, Dad.

20:50.874 --> 20:52.791
Or the guy who made me watch
his first-15 highlights

20:53.082 --> 20:55.791
and talks about making top
side and getting that contract.

20:56.082 --> 20:58.207
Or the guy who tries to show off
his hot girl to everyone.

20:58.541 --> 21:00.874
This is my missus!
Have you met my missus?

21:01.166 --> 21:03.541
The cheap guy who keeps
forgetting his wallet.

21:03.874 --> 21:06.999
And that guy whose face I can't
remember, cos he's ugly.

21:07.291 --> 21:10.541
So, you're thirsty
and you want me to...

21:10.874 --> 21:12.999
- ...get me through this year.
- Dehydrated.

21:13.291 --> 21:14.291
Yep, keep me on the
straight and narrow.

21:14.624 --> 21:15.957
Rather than the curvy and the wide.

21:16.249 --> 21:19.916
I'm serious. I can't afford
to stuff up this year.

21:20.207 --> 21:21.957
OK. I got you.

21:22.249 --> 21:22.999
- Eh?
- Eh?

21:23.332 --> 21:25.249
- Oh!
- Hey!

21:26.249 --> 21:27.291
Go make me some food.

21:27.624 --> 21:29.499
Get off me.

21:29.832 --> 21:34.166
He ain't got it on me. It's what
I thought, and now it's maybe.

21:34.499 --> 21:36.374
He's got me tripping.

21:36.707 --> 21:38.624
He could be the one.

21:48.749 --> 21:50.666
Hey.

21:51.541 --> 21:52.999
What? I forgot.
This was all I had in my bag.

21:53.332 --> 21:55.082
Girl, out of all the things
you could have worn...

21:55.416 --> 21:59.124
- Shh. Where's your shoes?
- Why are you looking at my feet?

21:59.457 --> 22:03.374
Fetish much? Hey, sis,
can I borrow your jacket?

22:04.207 --> 22:06.999
OK, we've talked to
a couple of companies,

22:07.291 --> 22:09.416
and you should start
making your rounds, OK?

22:09.749 --> 22:11.291
Yeah. Least we'll get some
free pens or something, eh?

22:11.624 --> 22:13.874
Hey, and don't start by asking
about the money, please.

22:14.166 --> 22:15.374
Sis, this smells like church.

22:15.707 --> 22:17.207
Shh. I'm serious.
Don't bring up the money.

22:17.541 --> 22:19.832
Excuse me, ladies. Bye-bye.

22:20.624 --> 22:22.957
You'll be well looked after.
So even if you were in the deep end-

22:23.249 --> 22:24.999
How much money will
I get in the deep end?

22:25.291 --> 22:28.541
That's a very good question. It does
vary based on a number of factors,

22:28.874 --> 22:31.499
but you're looking at
between 52 and 55 K-

22:31.832 --> 22:33.166
Later, bo.

22:33.499 --> 22:35.832
We are looking for those with
high technical competency-

22:36.124 --> 22:38.874
- How high is the money?
- Ooh, 58 to 60 K.

22:39.166 --> 22:41.249
Hmm. Mama needs new shoes.

22:42.082 --> 22:44.791
Automation is a continually
growing field,

22:45.082 --> 22:47.999
and we're working really hard
to be an attractive opportunity.

22:48.332 --> 22:49.374
How attractive can you make it?

22:49.707 --> 22:52.999
We're looking at around
58,000 to 65,000.

22:53.291 --> 22:55.791
And would you be looking
to talk to someone with top-class

22:56.082 --> 22:58.916
technical competency coupled
with a strong team-focused outlook

22:59.207 --> 23:00.499
and a personality that mitigates

23:00.832 --> 23:02.374
the stress levels of
a demanding environment?

23:02.707 --> 23:03.374
That would be someone we-

23:03.707 --> 23:05.874
Cos that would be
how I describe myself.

23:06.166 --> 23:08.999
Then you'll be someone we'll be
wanting to have a conversation with.

23:09.291 --> 23:11.707
Oh, if you insist. Too much.

23:12.416 --> 23:15.499
Welcome to the
Hunger Games, suckers!

23:17.624 --> 23:18.791
Hey, hey.

23:19.082 --> 23:21.916
The alternative,
as you know, is the OE,

23:22.207 --> 23:23.999
the traditional overseas experience,

23:24.291 --> 23:26.457
a truly amazing,
lifetime experience.

23:26.791 --> 23:30.207
So the question is,
should you take an OE?

23:30.666 --> 23:32.374
No.

23:32.707 --> 23:35.207
- Why?
- More opportunities for promotion,

23:35.541 --> 23:38.791
and if there is a shift in the
industry, because of the OE exodus,

23:39.082 --> 23:42.124
then it could leave you in
a stronger negotiating position.

23:42.457 --> 23:45.124
But you are discounting
the value of experience.

23:45.457 --> 23:47.374
An investment in the human
experience can pay dividends.

23:47.707 --> 23:50.291
The issue is maintaining an
uninterrupted earnings trajectory.

23:50.624 --> 23:51.791
Money cannot buy happiness.

23:52.082 --> 23:53.374
Being broke, you can't buy anything.

23:53.707 --> 23:54.166
Ooh.

23:54.499 --> 23:57.791
How could a narrow, uninformed world
view be of any value to a company,

23:58.082 --> 24:00.124
in an industry that is
constantly requiring innovation?

24:00.457 --> 24:02.374
Backpacking across continents
with diminishing funds,

24:02.707 --> 24:04.916
unpaid student loans
and shrinking employment prospects,

24:05.207 --> 24:07.416
where you're forced to take what
you can, rather than what you want,

24:07.749 --> 24:10.166
doesn't exactly put you in
a position to be of value to anyone.

24:10.499 --> 24:11.999
Life is to be lived.
You can see the world.

24:12.291 --> 24:14.999
Sitting on six figures in seven
years, student loans all paid,

24:15.332 --> 24:17.541
parents debts cleared,
a step on the property ladder,

24:17.874 --> 24:19.166
I would say I had
the world at my feet.

24:19.499 --> 24:22.207
Oh! Smashed 'em, bro.

24:22.832 --> 24:27.957
But is it an experience, that can
aid in your career progression?

24:34.457 --> 24:36.374
Hello!

24:37.291 --> 24:39.416
Hey, hey, hey!

24:41.666 --> 24:43.499
Remember me from the
Future Graduates' Network?

24:43.832 --> 24:46.499
- We had that rigorous debate.
- OK.

24:46.832 --> 24:48.832
I'm Stephen. Pleased to meet you.
Are you free to grab a coffee-?

24:49.124 --> 24:51.166
- I'm actually heading to class.
- ...after class, maybe?

24:51.499 --> 24:54.166
Good conversation is hard to find.

24:54.499 --> 24:56.166
I can give you the 2 minutes
it takes to walk to my class.

24:56.499 --> 24:58.207
I'll take it.

25:05.832 --> 25:07.957
- One minute.
- So precise.

25:08.249 --> 25:09.374
Spontaneity is not your style?

25:09.707 --> 25:11.791
Talking to strange guys
in the park is not my style.

25:12.082 --> 25:13.249
Fair enough.

25:13.582 --> 25:18.124
The cornerstone of progression
is discussion and critical thought.

25:18.457 --> 25:20.999
Bet you never thought a guy like me
could make a point like that, eh?

25:21.332 --> 25:22.832
Uh, thank you.
Your 2 minutes are up.

25:23.124 --> 25:27.041
No, thank you. No doubt
I'll see you round.

25:27.374 --> 25:29.291
'Sup?

25:30.082 --> 25:31.207
Hello.

25:31.541 --> 25:33.457
Later, bo.

25:37.124 --> 25:39.332
- Honest to who, that guy likes you.
- We were just talking.

25:39.666 --> 25:42.041
Oh yeah. Talk, talk; nek minnit-

25:42.374 --> 25:44.791
'Uh, Ruth, can you give me
a lift to the maternity ward?'

25:45.082 --> 25:47.041
- Not even.
- Sis, remember the plan.

25:47.374 --> 25:50.374
- I'm not attracted to him.
- I saw you looking at his Afro.

25:50.707 --> 25:51.791
Stop it.

25:52.082 --> 25:55.457
Hey, whatever he offers, just give
him a polite statement and leave.

25:55.791 --> 25:56.332
OK. OK.

25:56.666 --> 26:01.999
Any guy that wants to talk to you,
report back to me-name, location,

26:02.332 --> 26:06.374
topic of conversation. So what are
you gonna do next time you see him?

26:06.707 --> 26:11.207
- Polite statement and leave.
- Good girl. Here's a treat.

26:11.541 --> 26:13.457
Can you not?

26:26.207 --> 26:27.957
Oi. What's that?

26:28.249 --> 26:29.957
Course readings.

26:30.249 --> 26:32.124
Couldn't do the readings.

26:32.457 --> 26:33.499
What are you studying?

26:33.832 --> 26:36.082
Commerce,
but dropped out first year.

26:36.416 --> 26:39.791
- Would you go back?
- Mm, it's not really my thing.

26:42.082 --> 26:43.832
Hey.

26:44.124 --> 26:45.874
Since it's a slow night,

26:46.166 --> 26:48.207
I was looking to do more
kitchen and less floor work.

26:48.541 --> 26:51.249
Could you... show me how
to make a dish or two?

26:51.582 --> 26:53.791
- Uh, yeah, sure.
- Oh, sweet.

26:54.082 --> 26:55.999
Um, let's start with the salad.

26:56.332 --> 26:58.332
OK. Cool. What do we need?

26:59.791 --> 27:01.707
- Up here.
- OK.

27:06.166 --> 27:07.791
- Hey, cheers for the lesson.
- No problem.

27:08.082 --> 27:11.416
- I'll catch you next shift.
- Yep. Laters.

27:12.291 --> 27:15.291
- Why are you sitting on the bonnet?
- Warming my bum. How's work?

27:15.624 --> 27:17.541
Slow night.

27:19.457 --> 27:20.124
- Who's that guy?
- What guy?

27:20.457 --> 27:22.374
Uh, the only guy walking with
a bunch of girls from your work.

27:22.707 --> 27:25.791
- Oh, that's Anthony.
- Man, he's ugly.

27:26.499 --> 27:28.791
- What? No, he's...
- What did I say about guys?

27:29.082 --> 27:30.374
- I was gonna tell you.
- Sis, the plan.

27:30.707 --> 27:31.916
- It's nothing.
- Stick to it.

27:32.207 --> 27:34.124
I am.

28:27.499 --> 28:29.416
Yep.

28:53.707 --> 28:57.874
Good
morning. Coffee, no obligation?

28:58.166 --> 29:00.499
I know you're a woman
with no time to waste.

29:00.832 --> 29:03.791
- I don't drink coffee.
- No coffee, no worries.

29:04.082 --> 29:08.166
We have tea-Earl Grey, English
breakfast, green tea; soy latte,

29:08.499 --> 29:11.374
cappuccino, mochaccino,
hot chocolate, apple juice,

29:11.707 --> 29:16.082
orange juice, pineapple,
iced water, tap water...

29:18.082 --> 29:21.791
overpriced water; and on the
off chance you are feeling

29:22.082 --> 29:22.999
something...

29:23.332 --> 29:25.249
different...

29:26.707 --> 29:27.874
'Otai?

29:28.166 --> 29:30.499
Looks like we have a winner.

29:30.832 --> 29:33.332
OK. You enjoy the rest of your day.

29:33.666 --> 29:35.582
Thank you.

29:40.082 --> 29:41.207
Mmm.

29:41.541 --> 29:43.041
- Uh, hold out.

29:43.374 --> 29:44.416
- Is this 'otai?
- 'Otai.

29:44.749 --> 29:46.666
That's what I said.

29:48.082 --> 29:50.416
This has Afro boy a" over it.

29:50.749 --> 29:52.666
He said no obligation.

29:53.499 --> 29:55.166
- He's a nice guy.
- No.

30:02.791 --> 30:04.916
Lucky I'm hungry,
or I'd throw this at you.

30:05.207 --> 30:07.832
I'll see you later.
Bring the list for the project, OK?

30:14.332 --> 30:15.999
Hey, polo!

30:16.291 --> 30:18.207
Ooh!

30:20.082 --> 30:21.999
Hey!

30:26.457 --> 30:26.999
Hello.

30:27.332 --> 30:30.082
- Not sure if you remember me.
- Charlie from Luisa's wedding.

30:30.416 --> 30:33.957
I must have made
a good first impression.

30:34.249 --> 30:36.666
No, I just remember who you are.

30:37.499 --> 30:38.124
True.

30:38.457 --> 30:39.791
How long are you gonna
keep secrets from me?

30:40.082 --> 30:41.999
- Like what?
- You keep ankle-tapping me.

30:42.291 --> 30:43.999
I haven't talked to anyone.

30:44.332 --> 30:47.541
Liar, liar, G-string on fire.
If you had a G-string.

30:47.874 --> 30:49.499
You headed home for the day?

30:49.832 --> 30:52.166
What about Charlie
from Luisa's wedding?

30:52.499 --> 30:55.041
- Wait. You're stalking me now?
- It's called surveillance.

30:55.374 --> 30:57.124
Enjoy the rest of your day,
and all the best with your studies.

30:57.457 --> 30:58.999
Yeah, yeah, yeah, nah.
You too. See ya. Thank you!

30:59.332 --> 31:04.082
Don't hide-and-seek with me, sis.
I'm the master seeker.

31:04.416 --> 31:07.499
My ancestors were master seekers.

31:07.832 --> 31:10.416
They found your ancestors
on the other side of the world

31:10.749 --> 31:14.374
and told them about this guy
who was born about 2000 years ago.

31:14.707 --> 31:15.291
Nek minnit,

31:15.624 --> 31:19.082
all your Sundays are booked out
for the rest of your life.

31:19.416 --> 31:20.791
That's my pedigree,

31:21.082 --> 31:24.332
so you remember
who you're rocking with.

31:29.707 --> 31:33.874
Once again, I will not keep you.
I know time is of the essence.

31:34.166 --> 31:35.416
- A favourite colour.
- Red.

31:35.749 --> 31:38.791
Mine's blue. Would you like to
fight? I kid. I kid.

31:39.082 --> 31:42.291
Just a bit of street-gang humour
there. Favourite food?

31:42.624 --> 31:45.166
- Lasagne.
- Chicken fettuccine.

31:45.499 --> 31:47.416
We both like Italian.

31:49.624 --> 31:54.166
Lasagne, marinara and Parmesan,
Royal Doulton ceramic.

31:54.499 --> 31:58.999
Chicken fettuccine,
Mainland Tasty cheese, Tupperware.

31:59.291 --> 32:02.874
Thank you very much. How would
lunch fit into your schedule?

32:03.166 --> 32:05.499
I'd love to get your feedback
on my cooking.

32:05.832 --> 32:07.749
Uh...

32:08.832 --> 32:10.749
Uh...

32:13.207 --> 32:15.124
Say yes?

32:16.082 --> 32:17.791
Um...

32:18.082 --> 32:20.166
- yes?
- Awesome.

32:20.499 --> 32:22.416
- See you there.
- OK.

32:51.207 --> 32:55.291
I know this great Italian place
in town. Amazing food.

32:55.624 --> 32:57.999
- I would have to check-
- Answer me this-

32:58.291 --> 33:00.249
are you having a good time?

33:00.582 --> 33:02.374
- Yeah.
- Do you think we are...

33:02.707 --> 33:05.207
- connecting on some level?
- I guess so.

33:05.541 --> 33:07.874
So dinner wouldn't be
too uncomfortable?

33:08.166 --> 33:12.041
Just putting it out there. Say yes?

33:14.082 --> 33:16.999
Hey. The homeless
shelter's that way.

33:17.291 --> 33:19.499
- Get lost.
- Get an arts degree.

33:19.832 --> 33:21.541
Same thing.

33:21.874 --> 33:23.791
- Ooh!
- Did you hear that?

33:24.082 --> 33:27.416
- Calm down. Down.
- I'm gonna ACC his face.

33:30.499 --> 33:32.374
Biscuits, fia ai.

33:35.541 --> 33:37.416
There you go.

33:37.749 --> 33:39.666
Mmm. Mmm.

33:44.082 --> 33:46.749
This is good. Where'd you get this?

33:47.082 --> 33:48.999
Did you make it?

33:51.874 --> 33:53.791
Stephen did.

34:02.832 --> 34:04.749
- Ooh! Why?

34:05.082 --> 34:06.999
- Give me my jandal.

34:07.874 --> 34:09.291
- Give...
- He asked me out and I said yes,

34:09.623 --> 34:10.498
- but I wasn't thinking.
- ...the...

34:10.831 --> 34:12.998
- I didn't know what to do!
- ...jandal!

34:13.331 --> 34:16.373
Stop! I thought I could handle it,
and then I got caught up, and-

34:16.706 --> 34:17.956
That's how it is. You know this.

34:18.248 --> 34:19.373
But it's different
when you're treated-

34:19.706 --> 34:22.373
...nice. Yeah, I know.
I know these things, Biscuits.

34:22.706 --> 34:24.416
I know all the things.

34:24.748 --> 34:26.498
OK.

34:26.831 --> 34:30.206
Go on a date with the guy
who makes nice lasagne.

34:30.541 --> 34:32.791
And after that, just let him know
you ain't feeling it,

34:33.081 --> 34:37.206
and we'll be done with it,
you can get back on track.

34:46.081 --> 34:46.541
You mean...

34:49.248 --> 34:52.998
I literally said exactly that.

34:54.206 --> 34:55.123
Do you want me to help you

34:55.456 --> 34:59.374
- or give you a hiding?
- Help me. Please, help me.

34:59.749 --> 35:00.791
What do I wear?

35:01.082 --> 35:03.124
What you're wearing now.
Go with that.

35:03.457 --> 35:05.499
You want him to like you more?

35:05.832 --> 35:07.749
No.

35:13.166 --> 35:14.791
She always comes in time for dinner.

35:15.082 --> 35:16.832
We have to go back in to uni
just to finish-

35:17.124 --> 35:18.874
Malo.

35:19.166 --> 35:21.791
How's work, Mama?
Damn, that smells good.

35:22.082 --> 35:23.624
I'm just gonna take some
for our studies.

35:25.166 --> 35:26.874
Hibiscus said it's for
an assignment.

35:27.166 --> 35:29.291
Yeah. Study assignment, eh?

35:29.624 --> 35:31.624
Cool. Well, we better bounce.

35:34.624 --> 35:36.541
Bye.

35:37.332 --> 35:39.249
Open the bag.

35:47.082 --> 35:48.791
Be back by 10, no later.

35:49.082 --> 35:50.999
- Yeah. Fa.
- Fa.

35:56.166 --> 35:58.082
What are you doing?

35:59.332 --> 36:00.082
What are YOU doing?

36:00.416 --> 36:02.541
I didn't wanna go wearing just this.

36:02.874 --> 36:04.416
- Who cares?
- I care. I wanna look nice.

36:04.749 --> 36:06.791
Oh, you are taking stupid risks
for a stupid guy.

36:07.082 --> 36:08.999
He's not stupid.

36:21.832 --> 36:25.082
Beautiful flower
for a beautiful flower.

36:30.541 --> 36:31.332
Thank you.

36:31.666 --> 36:33.791
I hope you don't mind-
I've ordered a merlot for us.

36:34.082 --> 36:36.166
- Oh, I don't drink.
- Just pour you a glass anyway,

36:36.499 --> 36:38.874
see if we can persuade you of
the merits of a good red, yeah?

36:39.166 --> 36:43.249
I've also an entree, main
and dessert just for you.

36:43.582 --> 36:45.499
OK. Thank you.

36:47.082 --> 36:49.874
I take it a place like this
is quite a unique experience?

36:50.166 --> 36:52.041
Uh, yes. What makes you say that?

36:52.374 --> 36:56.124
Just connecting the dots. I presumed
you frequent fast-food restaurants.

36:56.457 --> 36:59.374
Uh, tell me about yourself.

36:59.707 --> 37:02.499
- Do you have any siblings?
- Two others. I'm the eldest.

37:02.832 --> 37:08.374
I set the pace for the family. Which
reminds me. One moment, please.

37:08.707 --> 37:11.666
Fakaalofa lahi atu.

37:12.624 --> 37:14.916
- How is your entree?
- Uh, it's great.

37:15.207 --> 37:17.374
Uh, I was just wondering if
I could get some bread, please.

37:17.707 --> 37:21.207
Bread? Uh, yes. What kind
of bread would you like?

37:21.541 --> 37:23.416
Oh, just bread that I can butter.

37:23.749 --> 37:25.666
Very well.

37:26.457 --> 37:28.707
Yeah. Yeah.

37:31.707 --> 37:33.999
- Apologies for that.
- No need to apologise.

37:34.291 --> 37:40.041
I'm actually trilingual-English,
Niuean, and my third language...

37:42.832 --> 37:44.541
is success.

37:47.791 --> 37:49.999
Uh, yes.

37:50.291 --> 37:53.207
- Who's calling?
- Sorry. Excuse me.

37:56.332 --> 37:58.416
Hi, Mum.

38:00.249 --> 38:02.291
Sorry. I was just in the library,
and I just had to get out, because-

38:02.624 --> 38:04.999
You could answer the phone
and walk outside.

38:05.332 --> 38:06.957
Yes. I should have
done that. I'm sorry.

38:07.249 --> 38:08.999
- Have you finished yet?
- No. No.

38:09.291 --> 38:10.999
Who's there?

38:11.291 --> 38:13.999
Uh, students.
There's heaps of us here.

38:14.291 --> 38:16.999
Oh. So you're mucking around, huh?

38:17.874 --> 38:19.124
Uh, she's gone toilet.

38:19.457 --> 38:23.249
Then walk to the toilet
and put her on the phone.

38:38.874 --> 38:40.791
Ruth, now.

38:41.082 --> 38:42.999
- We better bounce, Biscuits.
- What's going on?

38:43.707 --> 38:46.499
I'm sorry. We just need to
get home-strict parent.

38:46.832 --> 38:49.332
- Trying to skip on the bill?
- Sorry?

38:49.666 --> 38:51.541
It's only fair
we go halves on the bill.

38:51.874 --> 38:54.916
The entree was 45,
the merlot was 98, the main is 55,

38:55.207 --> 38:56.832
and the dessert is
33 apiece, so that's-

38:57.124 --> 38:58.874
- 231.
- Impressive.

38:59.166 --> 39:03.541
- If I had asked. If need be, I can-
- It's OK. I can pay for it.

39:18.832 --> 39:20.332
Hibiscus...

39:23.874 --> 39:26.957
If you need to do work
at university, get up early.

39:27.249 --> 39:28.999
Ia.

39:29.291 --> 39:31.207
No more late nights.

39:45.707 --> 39:47.541
Can you get a rough prototype
by the end of this weekend?

39:47.874 --> 39:50.124
Yeah. Uh, have you started the app?

39:50.457 --> 39:52.166
Yeah. I'll design
the UI this weekend.

39:52.499 --> 39:55.082
Put your schedule
in the shared docs.

39:55.416 --> 39:57.332
Hey. You OK?

40:00.166 --> 40:01.916
Yeah.

40:02.207 --> 40:05.374
- Keep me in the loop.
- It's OK. I'm OK.

40:05.707 --> 40:07.832
- I'll get over it.
- Sweet.

40:15.249 --> 40:18.874
Hey, team. Looking for staff
for an off-site corporate

40:19.166 --> 40:22.999
for next Monday evening. Before
I hit these lists, who's keen?

40:23.332 --> 40:24.957
- Time and a half, eh, boss?
- No. Why would it be?

40:25.249 --> 40:26.166
Oh, sorry, boss.
I'll be busy sleeping.

40:26.499 --> 40:28.124
Yeah, I've got a thing.

40:28.457 --> 40:30.916
Yeah, so sorry.
I've got the same thing.

40:31.207 --> 40:32.916
Uh, yeah, what she said.

40:33.207 --> 40:33.957
Sign me up.

40:34.249 --> 40:36.082
Thank you,
most reliable person here.

40:36.416 --> 40:37.874
- I'm keen.
- Thank you, Anthony.

40:38.166 --> 40:39.416
I can do it too now.
I'll move my thing.

40:39.749 --> 40:40.999
- Yeah, I'm keen.
- OK.

40:41.291 --> 40:44.124
- And me.
- Thank you. See you there.

40:52.666 --> 40:54.957
Hey. I'm just about to lock up.

40:55.249 --> 40:58.124
- Sorry. I'll just wait outside.
- Nah, nah, it's all right.

40:58.457 --> 41:01.041
- You waiting for your ride?
- Yeah.

41:07.291 --> 41:08.999
- You alright?

41:09.291 --> 41:11.124
- Yeah. Just some dramas.

41:11.457 --> 41:15.041
- Thought you'd be immune to dramas.
- Me too.

41:15.374 --> 41:18.999
Well, if you need
any advice, ask away.

41:19.291 --> 41:22.916
What I lack in qualifications,
I make up for in drama experience.

41:23.207 --> 41:24.957
What is it? Money?

41:25.249 --> 41:27.166
Family? Boys?

41:30.749 --> 41:33.332
But never again.

41:34.249 --> 41:37.374
Oh, that's probably a good plan.
My parents used to say, 'Get your

41:37.707 --> 41:42.041
'education before you go chasing
girls.' And I would say to them...

41:50.332 --> 41:54.374
- Wait. You speak Samoan?
- Yeah. Mum's Samoan. Dad's French.

42:06.666 --> 42:08.582
Fa.

42:15.082 --> 42:17.166
Yes, yes. Um, manuia le po.

42:21.416 --> 42:24.124
- How's work?
- Fine. Just the usual.

42:38.832 --> 42:40.916
How much is in your
faalavelave account?

42:41.207 --> 42:42.416
900.

42:42.749 --> 42:44.666
I need 800.

42:46.332 --> 42:48.207
OK. I'll transfer it over.

42:48.541 --> 42:50.457
Ruth.

42:52.291 --> 42:56.624
Watching the internet. Aah!
I mean, uh, Bible things.

42:59.291 --> 43:00.957
And I'm turning that
modern off as well.

43:01.249 --> 43:02.874
- Aw!
- Ole a?

43:03.166 --> 43:04.041
Nothing!

43:04.374 --> 43:07.374
Now is not the time
to be slacking off.

43:44.207 --> 43:47.374
Whatever your project is, it should
be well into the development phase.

43:47.707 --> 43:49.416
This is where the hard work begins.

43:49.749 --> 43:53.124
- Come to mama.
- Mistakes, errors in judgement...

43:53.457 --> 43:55.166
Come wake up mama.

43:55.499 --> 43:57.416
Aw-

43:59.624 --> 44:03.832
Remember to keep your
development logs updated. OK?

44:13.791 --> 44:16.791
- Anything else, Mum?
- Where you rushing off to?

44:17.082 --> 44:20.457
Uh, to sleep. I need to
wake up early tomorrow.

44:20.791 --> 44:22.707
OK. Ia...

44:55.291 --> 44:57.999
Tell me the occasion, and I promise
I'll get you what you need.

44:58.291 --> 45:00.999
- Uh, thanks. I'm just looking for-
- What's the event?

45:01.291 --> 45:04.499
- Um, drinks.
- Ah. For when you're thirsty.

45:04.832 --> 45:06.499
Is he hot?

45:06.832 --> 45:08.541
Uh...

45:08.874 --> 45:10.874
Is he real? Like, have you
seen him in real life?

45:11.166 --> 45:13.291
- Yes, he's real.
- Oh, good.

45:13.624 --> 45:17.416
- Did you have a look in mind?
- Well, I'm just...

45:22.291 --> 45:24.249
I like... I like that one.

45:25.499 --> 45:28.666
Well, if it speaks to you,
let it preach.

45:32.124 --> 45:34.041
That's us.

45:51.082 --> 45:52.124
- Hey.
- Hey.

45:52.457 --> 45:54.249
Do you want me
to take out the trash?

45:54.582 --> 45:56.541
Um, no, it's actually done.

45:56.874 --> 45:58.791
- Cool.
- Yeah.

45:59.082 --> 46:02.416
- You still good for drinks?
- Oh, uh, yeah.

46:03.624 --> 46:04.249
Sweet.

46:04.582 --> 46:06.499
Um, can you give me,
like, five, 10 minutes?

46:06.832 --> 46:08.374
Yeah, no prob. See you soon, eh?

46:08.707 --> 46:10.624
Cool. Thank you.

46:14.207 --> 46:15.082
And that's how I got
all my injuries-

46:15.416 --> 46:16.916
my groin, my Achilles and my delts.

46:17.207 --> 46:20.124
- Oh yeah? All in one game, bro?
- Nah, all in one tackle.

46:20.457 --> 46:23.207
Oh, stop it, sole.

46:26.541 --> 46:28.457
Um...

46:29.582 --> 46:31.291
- Hey.
- Uh...

46:31.624 --> 46:34.166
- hey.
- Sorry to keep you waiting.

46:34.499 --> 46:36.166
Oh, no worries.

46:36.499 --> 46:40.249
- We can head down the road.
- That sounds good.

46:47.749 --> 46:49.124
Hey.

46:49.457 --> 46:52.207
Sorry to keep you waiting.

47:02.541 --> 47:05.999
Uh, this is too much.
I am so sorry, but I just-

47:06.291 --> 47:09.541
No, wait. Wait. No.
No, you look beautiful.

47:09.874 --> 47:13.082
I'm flattered you think
I'm worth dressing up for.

47:13.416 --> 47:16.332
- Thanks.
- Um, what can I get for you?

47:17.207 --> 47:19.541
- I don't drink.
- Never had a drink?

47:19.874 --> 47:22.416
Uh, first time for everything.

47:24.499 --> 47:27.291
Nah. Save your first drink
for something special.

47:27.624 --> 47:29.332
Don't waste it on me.

47:37.166 --> 47:41.874
The kitchen boys tell me you're
a scholar-Bachelor Of Engineering,

47:42.166 --> 47:46.791
final year, on your way to
first-class honours, amazing cook,

47:47.082 --> 47:49.249
- making more per hour than me.
- Not if you're including tips.

47:49.582 --> 47:52.166
Only child, no boyfriend.

47:52.499 --> 47:54.457
OK. I tell them way too much.

47:54.791 --> 47:57.957
They didn't tell me you were
beautiful; I worked that out myself.

48:02.249 --> 48:03.999
Sorry.

48:23.207 --> 48:24.374
Why are you just opening
your eyes now?

48:24.707 --> 48:28.582
Uh, I had to... uh, do some stuff.

48:29.124 --> 48:31.791
- What stuff?
- Just some uni notes.

48:32.082 --> 48:34.832
Why are you doing notes after work?
That's why you have a schedule.

48:35.124 --> 48:37.374
Everything has a time
and a place. Look at the time-

48:37.707 --> 48:39.332
aren't you supposed
to be in class now?

48:39.666 --> 48:41.332
- Uh-
- No early lecture today.

48:41.666 --> 48:43.999
DIY peer reviews of our
development plans for our projects,

48:44.291 --> 48:45.999
- eh, Biscuits?
- Still shouldn't be sleeping in.

48:46.291 --> 48:48.374
Sorry. I'll keep to
the schedule.

48:48.707 --> 48:51.207
And you're on dinner tonight.

48:51.666 --> 48:53.166
And why are you still
in your pyjamas?

48:53.499 --> 48:56.624
Oh, yeah, right.
Better go get changed.

48:58.374 --> 49:00.291
Why are you wearing it?

49:00.624 --> 49:01.999
Why are you saying yes to the dress?

49:02.291 --> 49:05.749
Mum's gonna see it.
Hide it. Put it back.

49:07.541 --> 49:09.791
Oh. Just a new dress.
What do you think?

49:10.082 --> 49:13.582
- Take it back. It's too big.
- Aw. Really? OK.

49:14.874 --> 49:15.541
How do you know?

49:15.874 --> 49:21.082
Firstly, that guy is hot.
So credit... where credit... is due.

49:21.416 --> 49:23.499
- It's nothing.
- Hmm.

49:23.832 --> 49:26.916
This dress doesn't say
that it's nothing.

49:27.207 --> 49:29.416
First, just admit that you like him.

49:29.749 --> 49:31.249
It's OK. You don't have
to be ashamed about it.

49:31.582 --> 49:34.166
- I'm not ashamed.
- Then say it.

49:37.416 --> 49:40.791
I'm guessing he hasn't made a move
yet. If he doesn't, we're all good.

49:41.082 --> 49:42.999
If he does...

49:45.499 --> 49:48.291
OK. Thanks, guys. See you next time.
Thanks for coming tonight.

49:48.624 --> 49:50.416
Drive safe, please.

49:50.749 --> 49:52.791
Whoo! What a night! Who's tired?

49:53.082 --> 49:58.624
Let's get this place tidied up, eh,
and let's get out of here. Come on.

50:00.291 --> 50:02.916
- Hey. I haven't seen you all night.
- Uh, yep.

50:03.207 --> 50:05.082
- Uh, need a hand?
- No, no. It's OK.

50:05.416 --> 50:06.957
- Just wanna pack up and go home.
- Are you sure?

50:07.249 --> 50:08.999
Yep.

50:15.499 --> 50:19.166
Ah, sorry. Sorry, man.
Can I get one more song, please?

50:19.499 --> 50:21.166
Yeah. What do you want?

50:21.499 --> 50:24.666
Guys, one more song.
Play one more song.

50:33.207 --> 50:37.082
I've been saving
these eyes for you...

50:38.499 --> 50:40.582
Hey, come here for a sec.
Come on. Come on. Come on.

50:40.916 --> 50:42.416
- No, please don't.

50:42.749 --> 50:46.624
Though I've never
been here before...

50:48.124 --> 50:49.916
this feels like fate.

50:50.207 --> 50:52.124
Don't.

50:53.082 --> 50:56.791
Never have I felt this way.

50:57.249 --> 51:01.124
I just witnessed heaven's display

51:01.707 --> 51:05.582
and all its beauty walking my way.

51:06.541 --> 51:09.624
This feels like fate.

51:13.416 --> 51:15.166
Please don't turn away.

51:15.499 --> 51:19.416
I fear my feelings
for you can't change.

51:22.791 --> 51:24.916
Cos when you danced my way,

51:25.207 --> 51:27.374
I saw the river sway,

51:27.707 --> 51:29.374
wind and fire play,

51:29.707 --> 51:32.374
and the stars, they shine away.

51:35.874 --> 51:38.124
This feels like...

51:38.457 --> 51:40.374
Ooh.

51:45.624 --> 51:47.249
Sa ou

51:47.582 --> 51:49.582
fa'atali mo oe

51:50.166 --> 51:53.582
taunu'u ta fa'amoemoe

51:54.374 --> 51:56.999
E mo'omo'o lo'u loto

51:57.291 --> 51:59.207
fa'aafe mo oe

52:00.374 --> 52:02.291
ia avea a'u mo oe

52:03.749 --> 52:05.666
o ta iuga.

52:06.416 --> 52:09.666
I see you
thinking it over.

52:10.082 --> 52:12.332
# Just let go. Let me be the,

52:12.707 --> 52:15.916
# one I can show you it all.

52:16.207 --> 52:19.041
If you're
who I've waited for,

52:19.374 --> 52:23.082
just let me know,
and I'll give you it all.

52:23.416 --> 52:25.499
Just say the word, and it's yours.

52:25.832 --> 52:29.707
# And if you feel
you can't tell if it's right,

52:31.082 --> 52:34.791
just listen to that
whisper inside.

52:35.707 --> 52:37.916
Till we find our way,

52:38.207 --> 52:40.291
this feels like fate.

52:42.541 --> 52:46.457
I've been saving
these eyes for you,

52:47.707 --> 52:51.624
cos no one else will do.

52:52.166 --> 52:56.041
Though I've never
been here before,

52:57.291 --> 53:01.749
# Still feels like fate.

53:04.707 --> 53:06.624
Ooh.

53:07.082 --> 53:10.791
# Still feels like fate. #

53:23.416 --> 53:24.166
I'm sorry.

53:24.499 --> 53:25.999
Hey, there's nothing
to be sorry about.

53:26.332 --> 53:28.041
I'm just not allowed.

53:28.374 --> 53:30.166
- Parents?
- Strict mum.

53:30.499 --> 53:32.374
You ever try negotiating?

53:32.707 --> 53:35.166
I don't think there's
a Samoan word for 'negotiate.'

53:35.499 --> 53:39.082
True that.
But you don't know until you try.

53:39.416 --> 53:41.124
I'd like to see you try.

53:41.457 --> 53:43.041
Thanks for the dance.

53:43.374 --> 53:45.999
Yeah. I liked the part
where you took the lead.

53:46.291 --> 53:49.207
I liked the part where you followed.

53:59.249 --> 54:00.457
Well, you should
have thought about that!

54:00.791 --> 54:02.707
Oh! Told you, Grandma!

54:32.499 --> 54:34.041
No.

54:34.374 --> 54:36.291
- Hibiscus!
- Ooh!

54:39.874 --> 54:41.791
Yeah?

54:59.499 --> 55:02.166
I know I'm probably the
last person you want to see,

55:02.499 --> 55:04.416
and I certainly respect the rules
you have set out for Hibiscus.

55:04.749 --> 55:06.541
If you know that,
then why are you here?

55:06.874 --> 55:08.791
Let the boy finish.

55:09.499 --> 55:13.624
As a token of my appreciation,
I've brought gifts.

55:14.499 --> 55:18.916
The purpose of my visit is to ask
permission to ask your daughter out.

55:19.207 --> 55:20.374
Who do you think you are,

55:20.707 --> 55:25.207
coming here with your tiny pig
and your tiny... brain?

55:26.832 --> 55:30.416
So you're asking permission
to ask permission?

55:30.749 --> 55:31.249
Yes.

55:31.582 --> 55:35.999
But if you know what rules I've set,
why are you bothering to ask?

55:36.332 --> 55:39.791
I believe in living a life
without regrets.

55:40.082 --> 55:42.041
Sometimes you have to take
a step into the unknown

55:42.374 --> 55:44.457
to truly find yourself.
You have to be curious-

55:44.791 --> 55:45.749
Shh.

55:47.416 --> 55:49.249
Have you ever heard the saying,
'Curiosity killed the cat'?

55:49.582 --> 55:51.374
They say satisfaction
brought him back.

55:51.707 --> 55:53.874
Oh? What kind of satisfaction
are you looking for? Huh?

55:54.166 --> 55:54.916
Oh!

55:55.207 --> 55:57.499
I only have the most
honourable of intentions.

55:57.832 --> 55:59.041
And if I say no?

55:59.374 --> 56:02.374
Then I'll respect your wishes and...

56:03.416 --> 56:05.332
leave Hibiscus alone.

56:06.082 --> 56:06.749
Hey.

56:11.874 --> 56:13.957
Have you been going out with boys?

56:14.249 --> 56:16.374
How many other boys are gonna be
showing up at our house?

56:16.707 --> 56:19.416
Well, if they do show up
and they bring food, it's good.

56:19.749 --> 56:21.666
Look at the pig.

56:31.416 --> 56:33.249
- How?
- He's been respectful-

56:33.582 --> 56:36.791
he came through the door;
he didn't climb through the window.

56:37.082 --> 56:41.124
So a guy brings food from the
bakery, cheap flowers and a pig,

56:41.457 --> 56:42.999
and it's OK to let
your granddaughter go?

56:43.332 --> 56:45.999
Don't uplift your voice.
I may be old, but...

56:47.207 --> 56:47.999
Hibiscus...

56:50.166 --> 56:52.999
This is why we set down these rules.

56:56.082 --> 56:58.207
OK. You want my permission?

56:59.707 --> 57:01.624
You have my permission.

57:03.499 --> 57:05.416
Thank you.

57:07.082 --> 57:10.999
Hibiscus, would you like
to go to dinner with me?

57:18.416 --> 57:19.499
No.

57:19.832 --> 57:21.082
I appreciate-

57:23.624 --> 57:27.249
What a waste
of a beauty boy!

57:28.374 --> 57:31.416
But I insist you stay
for a cup of tea, OK?

57:31.749 --> 57:33.457
Host him yourself.

57:33.791 --> 57:35.707
- Ruth.
- OK.

57:39.082 --> 57:39.999
OK.

57:41.416 --> 57:44.207
No hug-hug and
no kiss-kiss, you know?

57:44.541 --> 57:46.999
I'm going to leave you. I'd better
go and see if that girl's eating

57:47.291 --> 57:49.166
all the things for the cup of tea.

58:27.374 --> 58:30.416
Home, university, work...

58:30.791 --> 58:32.707
home-nothing else.

58:58.291 --> 59:01.124
# She's been fighting hard to hide it.

59:03.166 --> 59:06.374
# Telling lies like she don't like it
The infatuation's

59:06.707 --> 59:10.082
# Screaming wild and she
don't even mind it.

59:10.666 --> 59:12.582
# She's got that love...

59:13.666 --> 59:15.582
# virus.

59:21.666 --> 59:23.374
Hey.

59:23.707 --> 59:25.791
I have to go catch my bus.
So I really need to go.

59:26.082 --> 59:27.207
I could give you a ride if you want.

59:27.541 --> 59:28.916
No, thanks. It's OK.

59:29.207 --> 59:31.541
Lucky. I don't even have a car.

59:34.624 --> 59:38.124
OK. Straight up-would you
like to go out sometime?

59:38.457 --> 59:40.457
Coffee? Dinner? Denny's?
Wendy's is not too far

59:40.791 --> 59:43.041
- from a bus stop.
- Hey, Charlie, thank you.

59:43.374 --> 59:44.832
I know it takes a lot
to ask someone out,

59:45.124 --> 59:47.249
and I really do appreciate it,
but I really can't.

59:47.582 --> 59:49.374
Completely understand.

59:49.707 --> 59:51.624
I'm sorry.

59:54.207 --> 59:59.041
If you don't mind, just for my
peace of mind, could I have, like,

59:59.374 --> 01:00:02.166
- a reason?
- No time and strict parent.

01:00:02.499 --> 01:00:04.999
Ha. I'm living, like,
the exact same life.

01:00:05.291 --> 01:00:06.332
So no girlfriends?

01:00:06.666 --> 01:00:09.874
I'm not allowed to go out with a
girl until I make 50 K before tax.

01:00:10.166 --> 01:00:12.124
- That's really specific.
- Yeah.

01:00:12.457 --> 01:00:15.499
They're, like, 'Bring home the bacon
before you bring home the pig.'

01:00:15.832 --> 01:00:17.499
- What?
- Sorry.

01:00:17.832 --> 01:00:20.166
- I don't mean it like that.
- So, wait.

01:00:20.499 --> 01:00:25.166
If you're not allowed any
girlfriends, why did you ask me out?

01:00:25.499 --> 01:00:29.207
Uh, when you like someone,
you do crazy things.

01:00:29.541 --> 01:00:30.999
I'm really sorry that I didn't
give you the answer

01:00:31.332 --> 01:00:36.082
- that you were looking for-
- Nah, it's all good. I'm fine.

01:00:36.541 --> 01:00:40.124
I'm just gonna go have
a cry in the corner...

01:00:40.791 --> 01:00:42.707
and do some CrossFit.

01:00:43.749 --> 01:00:45.666
See you later.

01:00:56.499 --> 01:00:57.249
See?

01:00:59.832 --> 01:01:04.041
Get more done when you're
not mucking around, huh?

01:01:41.291 --> 01:01:43.207
Look who's back.

01:01:46.166 --> 01:01:48.082
Oh.

01:01:49.582 --> 01:01:52.332
I will pray for you.

01:01:57.499 --> 01:02:00.124
Laters.

01:02:21.499 --> 01:02:23.416
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:02:24.332 --> 01:02:25.999
You look...

01:02:26.291 --> 01:02:27.249
stunning.

01:02:27.582 --> 01:02:30.582
- Thank you.
- What changed your mind?

01:02:32.249 --> 01:02:33.416
And your mum?

01:02:33.749 --> 01:02:36.332
Well, we kind of have to finish
this date in 15 minutes, sorry.

01:02:36.666 --> 01:02:39.999
- So a speed date, then.
- Talk fast, and then eat fast.

01:02:40.332 --> 01:02:42.249
- All right.
- Ready?

01:02:43.082 --> 01:02:44.999
- Set.

01:02:46.332 --> 01:02:48.541
- What do you like about me?
- Mm.

01:02:48.874 --> 01:02:50.374
Sorry.

01:02:50.707 --> 01:02:52.541
Your personality.

01:02:52.874 --> 01:02:55.332
Eat faster.

01:02:58.499 --> 01:03:00.541
This is really good, though.

01:03:00.874 --> 01:03:04.166
Just slow down, mate.

01:03:20.166 --> 01:03:22.082
How was your day?

01:03:25.416 --> 01:03:27.332
OK.

01:03:29.791 --> 01:03:33.124
Hey. I was just wondering
if you could help me look for...

01:03:33.457 --> 01:03:35.999
Don't preach to the choir, sis.

01:03:39.791 --> 01:03:42.416
Can't deny I'm falling for you,

01:03:44.499 --> 01:03:46.416
falling for you.

01:03:50.374 --> 01:03:52.166
# Tell me you feel me.

01:03:52.499 --> 01:03:54.166
# Baby, I feel you.

01:03:54.499 --> 01:03:56.166
I'm getting ready.

01:03:56.499 --> 01:03:58.666
Yeah. OK. I'll see you soon.

01:04:01.166 --> 01:04:02.374
Can't deny I'm falling for you.

01:04:02.707 --> 01:04:04.624
Oh, no. I got it. I got it.

01:04:05.624 --> 01:04:08.124
Can't deny
I'm falling for you...

01:04:08.457 --> 01:04:10.166
It's OK. I've got this.

01:04:10.499 --> 01:04:12.457
- No, no, no. I can chip in.
- Please. My shout. I insist.

01:04:12.791 --> 01:04:15.416
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, of course.

01:04:19.832 --> 01:04:22.416
- How old are you, 13?
- What? No.

01:04:22.749 --> 01:04:24.999
It's fine. I went out
of my way just for you.

01:04:25.291 --> 01:04:26.457
I guess later in life,

01:04:26.791 --> 01:04:28.791
you'll regret not taking
the opportunity before you.

01:04:29.082 --> 01:04:32.082
If you can be more accommodating,
then maybe we could try this again.

01:04:32.416 --> 01:04:35.082
Maybe?

01:04:35.416 --> 01:04:37.332
You think I'm playing.

01:04:38.416 --> 01:04:40.749
# Lately, I've been changing.

01:04:41.707 --> 01:04:44.332
Can't deny I'm falling for you.

01:04:46.291 --> 01:04:48.832
Can't deny I'm falling for you.

01:04:49.749 --> 01:04:51.416
Argh!

01:04:51.749 --> 01:04:53.666
Hope you feel it too,

01:04:54.666 --> 01:04:56.582
feel it too.

01:05:06.082 --> 01:05:09.374
- Recommended first drink?
- I'm thinking something classy.

01:05:09.707 --> 01:05:10.291
Wine?

01:05:10.624 --> 01:05:12.207
Well, you should save it
for a special occasion.

01:05:12.541 --> 01:05:14.457
- This feels special enough.
- Really?

01:05:14.791 --> 01:05:17.999
Well, it's better than
a box and a car park.

01:05:18.291 --> 01:05:20.207
True.

01:05:20.707 --> 01:05:22.791
You keen to try something different?

01:05:23.082 --> 01:05:24.249
What did you have in mind?

01:05:24.582 --> 01:05:26.499
Oh, far.

01:05:27.541 --> 01:05:29.999
- It's better than a drink.
- Yeah!

01:05:30.291 --> 01:05:33.041
- Come on. It's all in your head.
- Yeah. All in my head.

01:05:33.374 --> 01:05:37.166
It's all in...
There is no fat in my head.

01:05:39.541 --> 01:05:41.624
Best date ever!

01:05:42.291 --> 01:05:44.541
- Yeah.
- We should do this every day.

01:05:44.874 --> 01:05:46.791
Yeah.

01:05:52.249 --> 01:05:55.082
Hey. Sorry. Sorry I'm late.
I lost track of time.

01:05:55.416 --> 01:05:57.999
- Why is that?
- Um, I was just...

01:05:58.832 --> 01:06:01.041
Hey, is that the necklace?

01:06:04.499 --> 01:06:06.166
Oh. That looks good.

01:06:06.499 --> 01:06:08.207
Really?

01:06:08.541 --> 01:06:10.791
It's a start. It's a prototype.

01:06:11.082 --> 01:06:12.457
We should have been
at this stage weeks ago.

01:06:12.791 --> 01:06:15.249
We still have to test
the bloody thing.

01:06:15.582 --> 01:06:16.874
You started the app?

01:06:17.166 --> 01:06:21.416
Uh, yes. I loaded it up
this morning, and it's a draft.

01:06:27.707 --> 01:06:29.416
- I wanna smash your face.
- What?

01:06:29.749 --> 01:06:31.291
This looks like
a 10-year-old made it.

01:06:31.624 --> 01:06:32.957
The font is Times New Roman.

01:06:33.249 --> 01:06:35.374
Why don't you just spit in my face?
It'd be less offensive.

01:06:35.707 --> 01:06:36.957
This is rushed BS, Biscuits.

01:06:37.249 --> 01:06:39.832
Straight up, how many hours
did you spend on this?

01:06:52.291 --> 01:06:54.416
I'm going out with Anthony.

01:07:01.582 --> 01:07:04.124
I- Please don't be mad.
Please don't be mad.

01:07:04.457 --> 01:07:05.999
- One...
- I'm really sorry.

01:07:06.291 --> 01:07:07.874
- I know I should have told you.
- ...two...

01:07:08.166 --> 01:07:10.416
And I know we've talked about
the plan, yes. But this is-

01:07:10.749 --> 01:07:12.374
- ...three, four...
- It's just he's really different.

01:07:12.707 --> 01:07:13.999
He's not like the guys
that you go out with.

01:07:14.291 --> 01:07:16.999
- ...five, six...
- If you just please just sit down,

01:07:17.291 --> 01:07:19.541
and I will tell you everything.
I'll explain everything.

01:07:19.874 --> 01:07:22.791
- ...eight, nine...
- I'm really sorry.

01:07:23.082 --> 01:07:24.999
- Please. Ruth, can you just...?
- ...10.

01:07:25.332 --> 01:07:27.249
Please. No. Wait.

01:07:29.082 --> 01:07:30.999
No. Please don't go.

01:07:31.791 --> 01:07:33.999
Ruth, don't go. Don't we...?

01:07:34.291 --> 01:07:36.207
Please.

01:07:46.499 --> 01:07:48.416
# I laid down my trust

01:07:48.874 --> 01:07:50.791
gave you it all.

01:07:51.499 --> 01:07:52.999
You said lean back,

01:07:53.332 --> 01:07:55.249
# said I won't fall. #

01:07:59.082 --> 01:08:00.832
No peeking.

01:08:01.124 --> 01:08:04.582
Just come on.
Take a few steps to your right.

01:08:05.291 --> 01:08:06.374
Slowly.

01:08:06.707 --> 01:08:11.416
- Am I here? Right here?
- Yep, right here. And... open.

01:08:13.874 --> 01:08:15.791
Look-it's our picnic.

01:08:16.082 --> 01:08:19.499
Thought I'd
do something special.

01:08:24.082 --> 01:08:25.916
- You all right?
- Uh...

01:08:26.207 --> 01:08:28.999
Why did you
pick this place?

01:08:29.291 --> 01:08:31.957
I mean, look at it. It's beautiful.

01:08:32.249 --> 01:08:33.999
So...

01:08:34.291 --> 01:08:36.999
- when are you gonna tell your mum?
- I've got that figured out.

01:08:37.291 --> 01:08:38.916
I'll just tell her when I graduate.

01:08:39.207 --> 01:08:41.249
- OK.
- You can come and congratulate me,

01:08:41.582 --> 01:08:45.082
and then give me flowers,
give me a kiss, a hug,

01:08:45.416 --> 01:08:46.916
and then when Mum asks who you are,

01:08:47.207 --> 01:08:48.957
then I'll just say that
you're my boyfriend.

01:08:49.249 --> 01:08:51.082
And then we live happily ever after?

01:08:51.416 --> 01:08:53.791
- Yeah.
- It's a long time to keep a secret.

01:08:54.082 --> 01:08:57.791
You are sad to my plan. But what
about you? What plans do you have?

01:08:58.082 --> 01:08:59.999
Um, I'm not sure.

01:09:01.124 --> 01:09:03.291
- Yeah.
- You'd still work at the cafe?

01:09:03.624 --> 01:09:08.166
Yeah, probably. I make a lot of
money there, so it's all good.

01:09:08.499 --> 01:09:10.416
Oh. OK.

01:09:11.707 --> 01:09:13.624
Well, what was that?

01:09:14.374 --> 01:09:17.457
- What was what?
- Was that not good enough for you?

01:09:17.791 --> 01:09:19.207
No, no, no, no, no. I'm just saying,

01:09:19.541 --> 01:09:22.791
like, you don't wanna work there
forever. You can study or train.

01:09:23.082 --> 01:09:24.999
But what if I did?

01:09:26.207 --> 01:09:28.832
Uh, then yeah, that's OK, I guess.

01:09:30.291 --> 01:09:32.874
Are you trying to
tell me what to do?

01:09:33.166 --> 01:09:35.082
No! No.

01:09:35.624 --> 01:09:40.207
I just like planning ahead.
I'm sorry. Come. I'm sorry.

01:09:41.666 --> 01:09:44.416
- Yeah.
- I really am sorry.

01:09:44.749 --> 01:09:46.457
It's all right.

01:09:46.791 --> 01:09:48.707
I forgive you.

01:09:56.832 --> 01:09:58.499
Falling.

01:09:58.832 --> 01:10:02.374
# Even if I try, I can't
stop walking toward you.

01:10:02.707 --> 01:10:06.541
# Seems like no one matters.
Can't stop talking

01:10:06.874 --> 01:10:10.291
talking about this one
who's got me stalling...

01:10:12.666 --> 01:10:14.457
Like that, and push.

01:10:14.791 --> 01:10:16.791
# But I had to get to know you.

01:10:17.082 --> 01:10:20.791
# Said I'd say no.
I'd be lying till it's over...

01:10:25.124 --> 01:10:28.041
# Said I'd say no
Said I'd say no... #

01:10:29.082 --> 01:10:30.999
Psst. Oi.

01:10:33.707 --> 01:10:35.291
- Ready?
- No. Wait.

01:10:35.624 --> 01:10:37.832
- It's gotta be on the same hand.
- Yeah, my left-your left.

01:10:38.124 --> 01:10:40.332
- No.
- Yeah. Just watch.

01:10:40.666 --> 01:10:42.541
- I drink it to you. There you go.
- Drink it to me.

01:10:42.874 --> 01:10:44.791
Yeah.

01:10:50.457 --> 01:10:53.791
So, this side means
I'm single, right?

01:10:54.082 --> 01:10:56.541
Yeah, and on the left side
means you're taken.

01:10:56.874 --> 01:10:59.499
And what if I put the flower here?

01:11:00.166 --> 01:11:02.207
- It means go brush your teeth.
- Eh.

01:11:02.541 --> 01:11:04.832
- Oh my God.
- Easy.

01:11:05.124 --> 01:11:06.874
OK, then.

01:11:07.166 --> 01:11:10.082
- Babe, are you all right?
- It's OK. It's OK. It's OK.

01:11:10.416 --> 01:11:12.374
Oh my goodness.

01:11:24.166 --> 01:11:26.082
Hey. Nice tat.

01:11:26.582 --> 01:11:27.999
- Are you Samoan?
- Yeah.

01:11:28.291 --> 01:11:31.291
Oh really? You don't look it.
Whereabouts are you from?

01:11:38.457 --> 01:11:40.374
Fa.

01:11:44.166 --> 01:11:46.791
- Why are you being sad?
- I'm not being sad.

01:11:47.082 --> 01:11:47.999
You just dissed them.

01:11:48.291 --> 01:11:49.874
I was just showing them
that you're taken.

01:11:50.166 --> 01:11:53.874
Look. I know this is all new
to you, so let me spell it out-

01:11:54.166 --> 01:11:55.041
you have to trust me.

01:11:55.374 --> 01:11:56.999
So, what, if guys
were to come up to me-

01:11:57.291 --> 01:11:59.541
Why would guys come up to you?

01:12:01.124 --> 01:12:03.457
- What?
- Please just... I'm sorry.

01:12:03.791 --> 01:12:06.207
- Don't make a scene.
- Don't touch me.

01:12:25.124 --> 01:12:26.499
I thought you said you were tired.

01:12:26.832 --> 01:12:31.416
I'm just trying to unwind
and thinking about uni stuff.

01:12:34.832 --> 01:12:36.749
What sort of uni stuff?

01:12:37.749 --> 01:12:39.416
Math calculations.

01:13:26.791 --> 01:13:28.707
Hey, girl.

01:13:29.666 --> 01:13:30.957
Be productive.

01:13:31.249 --> 01:13:32.999
Ooh!

01:13:33.291 --> 01:13:34.416
- Yeah-yah.
- Argh. Not funny.

01:13:34.749 --> 01:13:36.457
Harden up.

01:13:36.791 --> 01:13:38.832
A 'well done' and a 'thank you'
would be nice.

01:13:39.124 --> 01:13:41.041
Yeah, thanks.

01:13:42.499 --> 01:13:44.249
So you're gonna get the
sample size and do the tests?

01:13:44.582 --> 01:13:48.291
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
I will get it running sometime.

01:13:48.624 --> 01:13:51.374
- Uh, just really busy.
- Oh. Yeah.

01:13:53.499 --> 01:13:55.416
Laters.

01:14:16.832 --> 01:14:19.332
I'd like everyone to give
a warm welcome to Susana,

01:14:19.666 --> 01:14:22.374
who'll be working on the main floor.

01:14:22.707 --> 01:14:24.624
Whoo!

01:14:25.499 --> 01:14:26.541
And that's how you make
a lot of money.

01:14:26.874 --> 01:14:28.416
- Say that again?
- I always wear it in my ear,

01:14:28.749 --> 01:14:31.082
and the girls ask why.
I say, 'Oh, it's cos I'm single.'

01:14:31.416 --> 01:14:34.791
Get heaps of money.

01:14:41.207 --> 01:14:43.166
- What are you doing?
- Uh, my job.

01:14:43.499 --> 01:14:45.499
Yeah, but I just saw you
talking to that new girl.

01:14:47.207 --> 01:14:51.541
No, why are trying to walk away
from me? Just talk to me.

01:14:54.332 --> 01:14:59.332
Look, if I've done something wrong,
then just tell me and I'll fix it.

01:14:59.666 --> 01:15:01.916
There's nothing to fix.

01:15:02.207 --> 01:15:03.457
Then what's wrong?

01:15:03.791 --> 01:15:06.374
No. Don't. Stop. Please.
Can you just tell me what-?

01:15:06.707 --> 01:15:08.791
Do you know what?
I don't wanna hurt you, but-

01:15:09.082 --> 01:15:12.166
- Then don't hurt me.
- I don't think this is working out.

01:15:12.499 --> 01:15:14.416
What?

01:15:14.749 --> 01:15:18.749
I think it's better if we
go our separate ways, OK?

01:15:20.332 --> 01:15:24.124
Not here, please. Let's just
be mature about this, OK?

01:15:45.541 --> 01:15:47.457
I know. It sucks.

01:15:48.166 --> 01:15:51.999
Um, let's just put this to one side.

01:15:52.291 --> 01:15:54.207
Tai lava.

01:15:56.791 --> 01:16:01.207
Hey, why don't you just take five,
get some fresh air?

01:16:03.791 --> 01:16:05.541
Just take the rest of the night off.

01:16:05.874 --> 01:16:07.791
# Can't take it,

01:16:09.457 --> 01:16:12.416
said here's my love-
don't waste it.

01:16:14.791 --> 01:16:17.207
And after all this waiting,

01:16:20.082 --> 01:16:22.541
you take my heart and break it.

01:16:35.791 --> 01:16:37.499
What's this?

01:16:37.832 --> 01:16:39.749
I'm sorry.

01:16:40.249 --> 01:16:42.166
Wait. Let's talk!

01:16:47.499 --> 01:16:50.832
- Who did this?
- No idea, boss

01:16:51.124 --> 01:16:53.041
Unlucky, uce.

01:17:23.666 --> 01:17:25.624
How long was I mistaken?

01:17:28.374 --> 01:17:29.791
# Holding hope in love that was fading.

01:17:34.166 --> 01:17:36.499
# Can I end this conversation?

01:17:38.582 --> 01:17:39.541
What are you doing?

01:17:39.874 --> 01:17:43.166
I'm just, uh, getting
ready to go to bed.

01:17:48.749 --> 01:17:51.374
# With farewell.
I wish we made it. #

01:18:05.249 --> 01:18:08.374
...lies with people.
Consider this proverb-

01:18:08.707 --> 01:18:11.249
if you want to plan
for a year, plant rice;

01:18:11.582 --> 01:18:13.832
if you want to plan for
10 years, plant trees.

01:18:35.624 --> 01:18:38.416
Can't confess on an empty stomach.

01:18:43.624 --> 01:18:45.541
Aw. Why for you cry?

01:18:47.666 --> 01:18:49.624
Anthony broke up with me.

01:18:50.332 --> 01:18:51.374
Oh wow.

01:18:51.707 --> 01:18:53.624
Can you not?

01:18:54.457 --> 01:18:56.916
- What did he do, then?
- He was just saying all this stuff,

01:18:57.207 --> 01:19:01.124
and there was this new girl who
looks like a prettier version of me.

01:19:01.457 --> 01:19:03.082
- So she looks like me?
- Please. Not now.

01:19:03.416 --> 01:19:06.791
- Sorry. Reflex.
- Then I saw him flirting with her,

01:19:07.082 --> 01:19:08.999
and she was flirting back.

01:19:09.291 --> 01:19:11.707
And then I... I just quit my job.

01:19:13.832 --> 01:19:15.166
Wow.

01:19:15.499 --> 01:19:16.999
Efficient as.

01:19:17.332 --> 01:19:21.499
I really thought
he was the one.

01:19:22.332 --> 01:19:24.041
Really?

01:19:25.166 --> 01:19:28.166
You know, why can't you just leave
me alone and get lost?

01:19:28.499 --> 01:19:30.374
We still need to
finish up the project.

01:19:30.707 --> 01:19:33.249
Biscuits, this is
a pass or fail for both of us.

01:19:33.582 --> 01:19:35.499
I know!

01:19:37.291 --> 01:19:39.207
Leave the food.

01:19:51.832 --> 01:19:53.166
- Hey. Hey.

01:19:53.499 --> 01:19:54.457
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:19:54.791 --> 01:19:56.707
- Uh...

01:19:57.249 --> 01:19:58.999
Charlie. Charlie.

01:19:59.291 --> 01:20:01.041
- Do you wanna try on my necklace?
- Uh...

01:20:01.374 --> 01:20:02.207
- It shocks you.
- I would,

01:20:02.541 --> 01:20:05.832
but I got to get to class.
Maybe next time?

01:20:06.707 --> 01:20:08.416
OK, then. Whatever.

01:20:26.582 --> 01:20:29.416
Does anybody wanna be productive?

01:20:30.082 --> 01:20:31.832
Anybody?

01:20:32.124 --> 01:20:35.791
Does anybody wanna try on
my necklace, please? Anyone?

01:20:36.082 --> 01:20:37.791
Please help me graduate.

01:20:38.082 --> 01:20:39.207
Ow!

01:20:39.541 --> 01:20:40.916
They're gonna ask about real-world-

01:20:41.207 --> 01:20:42.874
...examples,
development progressions,

01:20:43.166 --> 01:20:45.874
failures and troubleshooting.
I know. I'm not stupid.

01:20:46.166 --> 01:20:49.207
- So you're gonna take care of it?
- I just said I'll do it!

01:20:53.666 --> 01:20:55.749
See ya tomorrow, then.

01:20:56.499 --> 01:21:00.499
I hope my sis turns up,
cos I don't know who this is.

01:21:03.291 --> 01:21:04.749
Ruth?

01:21:06.624 --> 01:21:07.624
Goodbye, Grandma.

01:21:32.291 --> 01:21:35.124
Productivity.

01:21:35.457 --> 01:21:39.332
And that's our productivity
necklace. Thank you.

01:21:42.541 --> 01:21:44.457
Thank you. Question-

01:21:45.082 --> 01:21:46.832
any issues encountered?

01:21:47.124 --> 01:21:51.124
Uh, just finding a balance between
assembling the components in a way

01:21:51.457 --> 01:21:52.791
that maintained cosmetic aesthetics,

01:21:53.082 --> 01:21:55.082
keeping in mind the commercial
demands on such a product.

01:21:55.416 --> 01:21:58.916
You only tested it on one operating
system, on just one type of phone?

01:21:59.207 --> 01:22:01.207
Um, it's more efficient.

01:22:03.707 --> 01:22:08.374
OK. Given your sample size and the
duration of 10 days for testing,

01:22:08.707 --> 01:22:10.999
you should have begun your testing
about three months ago.

01:22:11.291 --> 01:22:13.291
But your development logs show that

01:22:13.624 --> 01:22:17.374
your first working prototype wasn't
even ready until six weeks ago.

01:22:17.707 --> 01:22:21.082
Would you care
to explain the discrepancy?

01:22:21.416 --> 01:22:23.582
Uh... that might be a typo.

01:22:24.416 --> 01:22:26.124
Hibiscus...

01:22:26.457 --> 01:22:28.791
you were testing the necklace-
raw data.

01:22:29.082 --> 01:22:31.166
How did the participants
track their progress?

01:22:31.499 --> 01:22:34.291
Just filled out forms
that I provided for them.

01:22:34.624 --> 01:22:39.166
So, we haven't received these.
They were done in a digital form?

01:22:39.499 --> 01:22:41.416
They were done by hand.

01:22:43.166 --> 01:22:44.999
I see. OK.

01:22:45.291 --> 01:22:50.041
OK. So if I were to give
you the time to go and retrieve

01:22:50.374 --> 01:22:55.457
these from the 50 people from your
sample who filled these out by hand

01:22:55.791 --> 01:23:00.374
over a couple of weeks,
you could get them for me, right?

01:23:06.832 --> 01:23:08.749
Um, no.

01:23:14.791 --> 01:23:17.457
Was this data fabricated?

01:23:22.707 --> 01:23:24.624
Yes.

01:23:29.082 --> 01:23:30.999
Hmm.

01:23:31.624 --> 01:23:33.332
Everybody take 15.

01:23:33.666 --> 01:23:36.416
Next group, prepare yourselves.

01:23:48.291 --> 01:23:51.041
I would be doing a great disservice
to both of you to let you

01:23:51.374 --> 01:23:54.791
into the real world without
adequate preparation

01:23:55.082 --> 01:23:57.916
and compromising
the integrity of the degree.

01:23:58.207 --> 01:24:00.916
Please, it's my fault.
I'm fully responsible for this.

01:24:01.207 --> 01:24:02.916
- I failed, not Ruth.
- This is a group project.

01:24:03.207 --> 01:24:06.166
- Please. Please, please.
- Responsibility is shared.

01:24:06.499 --> 01:24:07.374
If there were any issues,

01:24:07.707 --> 01:24:12.666
they should have been brought
to our attention a lot earlier.

01:24:34.541 --> 01:24:36.457
Why are you cooking in my suit?

01:24:37.791 --> 01:24:39.624
Does it matter?

01:24:43.749 --> 01:24:47.041
Oh, there's a funeral
this weekend. I need $300.

01:24:47.374 --> 01:24:49.082
Well, I don't have 300.

01:24:49.416 --> 01:24:52.207
- How much do you have?
- I have nothing. I spent it all.

01:24:52.541 --> 01:24:54.791
- On what?
- On life.

01:24:55.082 --> 01:24:57.166
- What's your problem?
- I don't see why we have to give

01:24:57.499 --> 01:25:00.374
money to people
that we don't even know.

01:25:00.707 --> 01:25:04.166
Dinner's ready. Help yourself
when you guys are hungry.

01:25:04.499 --> 01:25:05.291
Eh.

01:25:09.499 --> 01:25:11.249
I'm going to sleep, man.

01:25:11.582 --> 01:25:13.874
Oh, this is how you act
when you don't get your way.

01:25:14.166 --> 01:25:17.041
There's no point sending you to uni
if you're gonna be so stupid.

01:25:17.374 --> 01:25:19.416
Technically, I'll pay off
my own student loan,

01:25:19.749 --> 01:25:21.041
so you're not sending me anywhere.

01:25:21.374 --> 01:25:22.916
Oh, and where do you live?
Who pays for your food?

01:25:23.207 --> 01:25:25.166
I pay for board.
I pay for the internet.

01:25:25.499 --> 01:25:28.541
I paid for your niece's wedding.
I've lost count how many times

01:25:28.874 --> 01:25:30.749
I've paid for people's funerals
that I don't even know!

01:25:32.291 --> 01:25:33.207
- So you think you
don't have to pay?

01:25:33.541 --> 01:25:34.999
- I think I'm owed a break, Mum.
- From what?

01:25:35.291 --> 01:25:37.166
From you! You and your stupid rules!

01:25:37.499 --> 01:25:38.916
Those are the rules that
got you where you are now.

01:25:39.207 --> 01:25:41.082
I do anything and everything for
you, but it's still not good enough!

01:25:41.416 --> 01:25:43.791
And what do you wanna do?
You wanna throw them away for what?

01:25:44.082 --> 01:25:46.207
So you can have a boyfriend?
So you can go out with that guy?

01:25:46.541 --> 01:25:48.041
- I don't wanna go out with him!
- Then what?

01:25:48.374 --> 01:25:50.207
- I already did!
- You what?

01:25:50.541 --> 01:25:53.166
I did! And now it's over!
Are you happy?

01:25:53.499 --> 01:25:56.124
Are you happy?! Does that make you
feel happy? I stuffed everything up.

01:25:56.457 --> 01:25:59.499
We failed our project!
I failed it for Ruth!

01:25:59.832 --> 01:26:03.499
And if we have to graduate, we have
to start the whole year again!

01:26:03.832 --> 01:26:05.832
What, do you like
always being right?

01:26:06.124 --> 01:26:07.374
Does it feel good
to always be right?!

01:26:14.124 --> 01:26:16.041
Get out.

01:26:18.374 --> 01:26:20.291
Get out!

01:26:22.249 --> 01:26:24.166
Sorry, Mum.

01:29:32.249 --> 01:29:36.374
I was going to do a Bachelor
of Science, travel the world,

01:29:36.707 --> 01:29:39.166
come back here and buy a house.

01:29:40.291 --> 01:29:41.999
I had so many plans.

01:29:42.291 --> 01:29:44.374
Then I met this handsome guy,

01:29:44.707 --> 01:29:46.624
fell in love...

01:29:47.499 --> 01:29:49.416
got pregnant.

01:29:51.791 --> 01:29:53.999
We had a beautiful baby girl.

01:29:54.291 --> 01:29:58.832
It all happened so fast.
Things got so hard, I had to work.

01:30:01.291 --> 01:30:03.416
Had to send money back home.

01:30:05.749 --> 01:30:08.041
Studying wasn't an option.

01:30:09.791 --> 01:30:13.999
Once you turned 10,
I thought, 'This is my chance.'

01:30:14.624 --> 01:30:18.207
But your dad said no
and forced me to choose.

01:30:18.707 --> 01:30:20.624
So I did.

01:30:24.291 --> 01:30:26.541
I made a promise to myself...

01:30:28.124 --> 01:30:32.124
that my daughter wouldn't
make the same mistake.

01:30:35.666 --> 01:30:38.166
I was just trying to keep you safe.

01:30:56.707 --> 01:30:58.624
I'm sorry I let you down.

01:30:59.082 --> 01:31:01.249
No. No, you haven't.

01:31:02.249 --> 01:31:04.166
I'm so proud of you.

01:31:05.082 --> 01:31:07.166
I don't tell you that enough.

01:31:07.499 --> 01:31:09.416
But I stuffed up.

01:31:09.749 --> 01:31:11.666
We both stuffed up.

01:31:13.416 --> 01:31:15.832
Did you really fall for that guy?

01:31:16.124 --> 01:31:18.832
- Yeah.
- Spend money on a new dress?

01:31:20.291 --> 01:31:22.291
Yeah. Hair and shoes too.

01:31:23.832 --> 01:31:25.916
- Did he ask you for money?
- No.

01:31:26.207 --> 01:31:28.457
- Pay for him at times?
- Yeah.

01:31:29.082 --> 01:31:32.499
Forced you to do things
you didn't wanna do?

01:31:33.707 --> 01:31:35.624
We did CrossFit.

01:31:38.582 --> 01:31:41.166
- Other girls go after him?
- Yep.

01:31:41.499 --> 01:31:44.082
- Beat them up?
- No.

01:31:45.291 --> 01:31:47.207
Oh, yeah, good.

01:31:48.082 --> 01:31:49.832
Regrets?

01:31:50.124 --> 01:31:52.041
Lots.

01:31:55.291 --> 01:31:57.207
Oh.

01:32:01.082 --> 01:32:05.749
But I'd do it all again if it means
I get to have you in my life.

01:32:10.499 --> 01:32:12.582
I'll make it up to you, Mum.

01:32:13.082 --> 01:32:14.999
No, my baby girl...

01:32:16.082 --> 01:32:17.999
not to me.

01:33:58.291 --> 01:34:00.541
We've had an interesting year.

01:34:00.874 --> 01:34:05.624
It's been challenging,
but the best we've had as a family.

01:34:06.707 --> 01:34:09.332
I realise it's time for a change.

01:34:10.291 --> 01:34:14.207
So... the old rules...
will no longer stand.

01:34:15.082 --> 01:34:16.957
We've raised you
to use your initiative,

01:34:17.249 --> 01:34:19.041
based on our family values.

01:34:19.374 --> 01:34:22.166
We trust that you can
make the right decisions.

01:34:22.499 --> 01:34:26.374
The only thing is that you
talk to me no matter what.

01:34:26.707 --> 01:34:31.166
And I will make sure to listen
and guide you best that I can

01:34:31.499 --> 01:34:35.207
to deal with whatever
the world throws at you.

01:34:36.291 --> 01:34:37.999
Ia.

01:34:38.291 --> 01:34:40.249
Here's to a successful year.

01:34:40.582 --> 01:34:41.582
Yeah.

01:34:48.374 --> 01:34:50.374
Happy New Year.
