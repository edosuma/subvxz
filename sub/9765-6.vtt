00:01.065 --> 00:03.585
Okay, I'm fifteen years old, right?

00:03.682 --> 00:06.809
I'm gonna be sixteen in just a few months.

00:06.889 --> 00:09.946
And you know what kinda bugs me?
- You know what I really hate?

00:10.042 --> 00:13.540
Mom and dad still treat me like a child.
- Mom and dad still treat me like a child.

00:14.025 --> 00:19.749
Don't forget to wash your hands before dinner.
- Eat your vegetables if you wanna grow up big and strong.

00:19.854 --> 00:23.591
What am I, nine?
- I'm already both big and strong..

00:23.994 --> 00:25.099
kinda.

00:25.100 --> 00:27.798
Mom and dad are just gonna have
to deal with the fact that..

00:27.846 --> 00:30.383
I'm not a little kid anymore.
- I'm not a little kid anymore.

00:30.965 --> 00:35.431
Alright, let's try this one more time.
- Call it when you're ready.

00:35.551 --> 00:38.213
Ready, set, grape!

00:39.382 --> 00:41.077
Bulls eye!

00:41.102 --> 00:43.099
Alright, back at you.

00:45.028 --> 00:47.625
Yeah.

00:57.007 --> 00:59.969
An entire weekend, all to ourselves.

01:00.741 --> 01:05.415
No mom, no dad.
- 57 hours of total freedom.

01:05.832 --> 01:08.908
Without the man to keep us down.

01:09.005 --> 01:11.469
How great is this gonna be?
- We can stay up late.

01:11.470 --> 01:14.408
Yeah, we can.
- We can order pizza whenever we want.

01:14.410 --> 01:17.510
Yeah, we can.
- We can walk around in our underwear!

01:17.524 --> 01:19.251
No, we can't.

01:19.929 --> 01:24.308
Right.. So what do you want to do?
- I'm gonna try to score tickets to Rock Shock.

01:24.310 --> 01:27.500
I thought mom and dad already
said you couldn't go to that concert.

01:27.506 --> 01:33.335
I know. But I've only asked like ten times.
Mom usually cracks somewhere between 14 and 17.

01:33.883 --> 01:39.193
A toast. To a fun-filled parent-free weekend.
- Yeah, brother!

01:41.035 --> 01:44.431
Hey, and no little sister either.
- That's right..

01:44.440 --> 01:47.189
none of Megan's stupid practical jokes.

01:48.600 --> 01:52.765
Yeah. No one to put itching powder
in our toilet paper.

01:52.933 --> 01:55.758
Nothin' worse than itchy butt.

02:04.963 --> 02:07.893
Wow, it really worked.

02:09.007 --> 02:11.749
I can't wait for this weekend.

03:07.008 --> 03:10.358
Now, if you need to reach us, we both have our cell phones.
- Don't worry.

03:10.360 --> 03:14.012
We'll be fine.
- Ooh, we're late. We should really hit the road.

03:14.014 --> 03:15.044
Right.
- Right.

03:15.329 --> 03:18.703
Grammy's gonna be here in about an hour..
- Whoa, whoa, wait, wait, wait!

03:18.945 --> 03:21.640
What?
- Alright, grammy's coming!

03:21.646 --> 03:25.094
Josh.
- Oh, no. Grammy's coming.

03:26.711 --> 03:30.005
You didn't think we were gonna
leave you alone for an entire weekend?

03:30.075 --> 03:33.120
That's exactly what we thought!
We don't need a babysitter.

03:33.128 --> 03:35.060
Sorry, she's already on her way.

03:35.704 --> 03:38.910
Man.
- Megan, it's gonna be a long drive..

03:38.923 --> 03:42.802
is there anything you need to do?
- Can I give my brothers a good-bye hug?

03:42.810 --> 03:46.946
Gross.
- Fine, I'll just hug Josh, then.

03:47.973 --> 03:49.864
yesh

03:50.159 --> 03:52.330
That was nice.

03:52.340 --> 03:54.857
Have a great weekend, guys.
- Wait, wait, wait. Before you guys go..

03:54.861 --> 03:58.534
I have to ask, can I please..
- You cannot go to that Rock Shock concert..

03:58.540 --> 04:00.116
and that's final.

04:00.337 --> 04:02.672
Man.
- See you guys Sunday.

04:04.508 --> 04:09.989
Great. The whole weekend is ruined. I can't
believe your grandmother is coming to baby-sit us.

04:09.990 --> 04:14.297
Come on. Grammy's cool.
- She's not cool and she hates me.

04:14.300 --> 04:18.446
She does not. She just thinks
you're a little irresponsible.

04:18.447 --> 04:21.700
Can't say I disagree.
- Whatever.

04:21.714 --> 04:26.588
At least we have a little time before
she gets here. Let's have fun while we can.

04:28.511 --> 04:31.580
What?
You can't remember to lock the door?

04:32.284 --> 04:35.304
Wow. Weren't those two seconds fun?

04:36.472 --> 04:43.533
I must be in the wrong house. My Joshee
is cute, but nowhere near this handsome.

04:44.460 --> 04:48.757
I was expecting my Grammy.
Not this pretty young thang!

04:49.918 --> 04:52.169
Someone, please kill me.

04:54.094 --> 04:56.340
Your butt itches?

04:57.004 --> 04:59.573
Where'd that come from?
- I wonder..

04:59.729 --> 05:02.890
you don't put signs on people.
- I didn't put this sign on him..

05:02.947 --> 05:08.028
You don't see me putting a sign on your
back that says "lazy punk", do you?

05:08.984 --> 05:13.223
Grammy it's okay. Hey, did you bring me anything?
- What do you think?

05:13.240 --> 05:17.609
I got presents for both of you.
Let's see.

05:17.692 --> 05:21.319
Joshee.
Drake.

05:22.669 --> 05:29.406
Whoa! 50 bucks! How'd you know?
- You just enjoy it.

05:30.376 --> 05:34.056
Wow. Two dollars off my next haircut.

05:34.256 --> 05:38.133
I wouldn't wait too long to use that.
Your head looks like a filthy mop.

05:44.227 --> 05:48.505
Drake, be a lamb and carry my
suitcase up to Megan's room.

05:49.420 --> 05:52.016
Be a lamb.

05:54.804 --> 06:00.218
And unpack it when you get upstairs.
You can organize my thongs by color.

06:02.409 --> 06:05.418
Come here my little baby.

06:15.204 --> 06:18.647
What's the matter?
- I had to unpack your grandmother's suitcase.

06:18.650 --> 06:22.041
These hands have touched Grammy panties!

06:22.521 --> 06:25.994
Drake, open up the garage door.
- Okay.

06:27.855 --> 06:33.024
Come up.
- You know, Grammy's really cool once you get to know her..

06:33.104 --> 06:37.116
You see-ee.

06:37.118 --> 06:39.811
Uh, Drake.

06:42.453 --> 06:45.101
Lazy punk.

06:46.232 --> 06:51.772
Grammy got you.
- Ha ha ha yeah. I hate her so much.

06:53.410 --> 06:56.005
What's up, guys?
- Nothin' good.

06:56.014 --> 06:59.000
Well, it gets worse.
- Yeah, we got some bad news.

06:59.005 --> 07:04.900
Yeah, we couldn't get tickets to Rock Shock.
- Doesn't matter. I'm not allowed to go anyway.

07:04.901 --> 07:08.275
So no big deal. We'll just hang out here this weekend.
- Yeah, your parents are away, right?

07:08.280 --> 07:12.859
Yeah. Except Josh's grandmother
is here all week babysitting us.

07:12.865 --> 07:18.343
She's not babysitting.
She's hanging out and she's really cool.

07:18.807 --> 07:25.638
Who wants to play Bingo?
- Meeeeee!

07:32.520 --> 07:38.505
Joshee, why put meatballs in the salad?

07:38.761 --> 07:42.324
Why not put meatballs in the salad?

07:49.277 --> 07:53.105
Hey, Drake, just in time.
Dinner's almost ready.

07:53.109 --> 07:56.562
Aww, meatball salad again?

07:56.841 --> 08:02.978
I'll just grab a bite with the guys.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold your horses there, snack pants.

08:03.693 --> 08:06.800
Where do you think you're going?
- Out.

08:06.817 --> 08:10.900
No, you're not going to that Rock Pot concert.

08:11.202 --> 08:16.105
Your mom and dad were very clear with me on that.
- Okay, first: It's Rock Shock..

08:16.109 --> 08:19.600
and second:
I'm not going to it. I don't even have tickets, okay?

08:19.602 --> 08:23.084
Do I look stupid?
- Drake!

08:24.200 --> 08:29.220
Look, I'm just going to hang out with my friends.
- Don't lie to me. I wasn't born yesterday.

08:29.222 --> 08:31.950
Yeah, no doubt about that.

08:31.956 --> 08:37.883
Look you..
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Can't we all just get along?

08:37.886 --> 08:43.476
Come on, who wants a hug?
They're free!

08:44.346 --> 08:47.606
Joshee.

08:47.610 --> 08:51.237
You are so soft!

08:51.650 --> 08:57.150
And you are not going out tonight. You're staying
right here where I can keep an eye on you.

08:57.166 --> 09:01.002
It's Friday night! I can't just sit home.
What am I gonna do here?

09:01.010 --> 09:04.952
Oh, I know. You could take a bath and
put on some decent clothes.

09:06.162 --> 09:08.642
Don't do it, Drake.

09:10.506 --> 09:13.163
I'll be upstairs in my room.

09:15.540 --> 09:22.399
Okay. Here comes my backwards, over the
shoulder, special hoop-de-doop shot. Ready?

09:22.975 --> 09:25.485
Hey, Grammy, check this out.

09:31.254 --> 09:34.454
J-Josh!

09:34.968 --> 09:38.221
Your face is like a ball magnet.

09:39.288 --> 09:43.329
Funny. Too bad you can't play as
good as you talk trash.

09:43.395 --> 09:46.307
I play just fine.
- Oh yeah?

09:46.594 --> 09:49.796
Think you can beat Grammy
at a little one-on-one?

09:50.407 --> 09:54.743
No. I don't think I wanna play
basketball with a lady of your years.

09:54.807 --> 09:59.500
Why?
'Fraid you gonna get beat?

09:59.911 --> 10:03.938
Alright, you wanna play some ball? Let's play some ball.
- Good..

10:04.041 --> 10:07.610
what do you say we make this a little more interesting?

10:07.888 --> 10:11.844
You wanna bet me?
- First one to five points wins.

10:11.854 --> 10:13.870
You beat me, I'll let you go out
with your friends tonight.

10:13.891 --> 10:17.525
Seriously?
- Yeah. As long as you don't go to that Rock Snot concert.

10:18.171 --> 10:21.024
Deal! Let's play.
- Game on, chicken legs.

10:21.031 --> 10:22.846
Take it out.

10:36.229 --> 10:40.328
That's one.
- You enjoy it, cause that's all your gonna get little girl.

11:24.893 --> 11:29.287
Yes! 5 to nothin'. You have a good night,
Grammy. I'm outta here.

11:30.527 --> 11:33.626
What happened?
You usually paly better than that.

11:33.714 --> 11:38.388
Guess I'm gettin' too old.
- Ooh, maybe I could beat you now.

11:38.504 --> 11:41.532
Yeah..
Not that old.

11:50.807 --> 11:53.096
Hey, I was just going to meet you
guys at the coffee shop.

11:53.097 --> 11:55.252
Wouldn't you rather come with us to..

11:55.346 --> 11:57.000
Rock Shock!?
- Rock Shock!?

11:57.010 --> 11:58.772
What?
- Scottie got us tickets.

11:58.780 --> 12:00.258
And there free.

12:01.700 --> 12:02.896
I can't go.

12:02.909 --> 12:04.498
Why?
- What?!

12:04.790 --> 12:07.463
I promised Grammy.

12:07.971 --> 12:12.845
He wuves his gwammy.
- Gwammy's wittle boy.

12:13.008 --> 12:16.654
For your information,
I just beat her butt at basketball.

12:16.680 --> 12:20.611
Impressive. When we get back,
maybe you two can kickbox.

12:21.406 --> 12:24.648
Come on, let's just go man.
She's not gonna find out.

12:25.012 --> 12:28.822
Guys look, I want..
- Look, the show starts in an hour. We're going.

12:34.605 --> 12:35.994
Wait up!

12:46.104 --> 12:49.263
How great is this?
- Tickets.

12:49.327 --> 12:51.264
Yeah. He's got 'em.

12:56.531 --> 13:00.306
Hey come on, Drake. Lighten up.
Grammy's not gonna find out you're here.

13:00.321 --> 13:04.343
I know. You know, I just..
- Would you four please step to the side?

13:04.609 --> 13:05.840
Yeah, sure.
- Hey, what's going on?

13:05.850 --> 13:08.090
Could you come with me please?
- Is there a problem?

13:08.100 --> 13:10.800
Yeah. These tickets are fake.
- What?

13:10.809 --> 13:13.253
You guys are in some serious trouble.
Let's go.

13:13.255 --> 13:14.250
No we're not.
- Come on.

13:14.255 --> 13:16.484
We can't be.
- Move it.

13:32.250 --> 13:36.458
Can you believe it?
We made it backstage!

13:36.460 --> 13:39.360
This is not backstage!
- This is practically jail.

13:39.362 --> 13:41.486
Those guys are cops.
- Yes..

13:41.699 --> 13:45.502
scary cops who are going to arrest
us for having fake tickets, Scottie.

13:45.505 --> 13:48.545
Guys, the tickets are not fake.
- Are you sure?

13:48.550 --> 13:51.305
I photocopied 'em myself.

13:52.980 --> 13:56.160
What?
- You can't photocopy tickets.

13:56.163 --> 13:58.600
Yes you can!

13:58.604 --> 14:02.190
You just put 'em on the glass, close
the liddy thing and press copy.

14:02.197 --> 14:04.271
Any moron can do it.

14:05.842 --> 14:10.456
No, not just any moron.
It takes a special moron, like you!

14:11.575 --> 14:15.076
This might take a while.
You each get one phone call.

14:15.144 --> 14:17.092
I'll go first.

14:24.204 --> 14:29.066
Josh, it's Drake. I got a little problem here,
but you gotta swear not to tell Grammy.

14:29.305 --> 14:31.616
You swear?

14:31.721 --> 14:35.113
Well, then put down the meatball and swear!

14:41.605 --> 14:46.159
Josh! How'd you get here?
- Well, uh, well, um, uh..

14:46.414 --> 14:48.685
Surprise, surprise.

14:49.111 --> 14:52.904
Surprise, surprise.
- You swore you wouldn't tell her!

14:53.007 --> 14:57.674
I didn't tell her!
She was listening on the phone in the kitchen.

14:57.828 --> 15:01.603
That is eavesdropping.
- You know he does have a point..

15:01.604 --> 15:04.770
you should trust us.
- I trust you.

15:04.779 --> 15:06.598
She trusts me.

15:06.600 --> 15:11.614
I don't trust delinquents who lie to me and go to
concerts when they promised me they wouldn't.

15:11.625 --> 15:14.138
You know, you did promise.

15:14.140 --> 15:18.433
Who's side are you on?
- I just want peace!

15:18.658 --> 15:23.171
So is he goin' to jail or what?
- Either that, or he pays the fine.

15:31.592 --> 15:35.860
Unbelievable! A 200 dollar fine!
- I'm sorry!

15:36.054 --> 15:40.203
You're just lucky I paid it.
I could've let them lock you up in the juvi.

15:40.619 --> 15:43.699
You know what happens to kids in the juvi.

15:44.452 --> 15:48.260
How many times can I say I'm sorry?
- I'll let you know when you get there.

15:48.605 --> 15:52.940
Boy, when I tell your parents about this,
they're gonna ground you for a month.

15:53.000 --> 15:56.500
Look, just so you know, I wasn't
planning on going to that concert..

15:56.501 --> 15:59.615
my friends just showed up last minute
with free tickets, and I don't-I don't know..

15:59.696 --> 16:01.080
I got talked into it.

16:01.089 --> 16:05.199
Well a responsible young man doesn't
give into peer pressure so easily.

16:05.200 --> 16:07.639
I always tell 'im that.

16:08.032 --> 16:10.136
No need to glare.

16:11.291 --> 16:14.500
200 dollars you cost me.

16:14.509 --> 16:18.200
That's what I get for being so nice
and letting you win that basketball game.

16:18.205 --> 16:22.730
Look, I said I'm so.. Wait.
What-what do you mean let me win?

16:22.732 --> 16:26.116
Forget it.
- No, say it.

16:26.608 --> 16:31.776
Okay, fine. Joshee made me feel bad
for giving you such a hard time.

16:31.778 --> 16:35.077
That's why I let you win, so you
could go out with your friends.

16:35.261 --> 16:37.825
Right. I beat you and you know it.

16:37.828 --> 16:40.232
You couldn't beat an egg.

16:41.707 --> 16:44.114
Oh, is that right?

16:44.376 --> 16:46.840
You wanna rematch?
Right now?

16:46.945 --> 16:50.211
No, I don't think I need to
beat you twice in one night.

16:50.446 --> 16:56.556
Tell you what. We play. If you win, I won't
tell your parents you went to that concert.

16:56.814 --> 16:58.336
Deal.
- Wait..

16:58.456 --> 17:02.201
but if I win, you're gonna tell 'em.

17:02.205 --> 17:04.224
No problem, let's play.

17:06.642 --> 17:09.428
This is better than Bingo!

17:11.699 --> 17:13.746
Go ahead, take it out.

17:15.992 --> 17:17.747
Anytime.

17:25.305 --> 17:28.970
Yeah.
That's what I'm talkin' about.

17:29.506 --> 17:32.091
Grammy brought her "A" game.

17:33.309 --> 17:35.559
Loser takes it out.

17:36.310 --> 17:38.052
Loser.

17:38.626 --> 17:41.550
Yeah?
Well here's how we do it in this century.

17:45.393 --> 17:49.619
Ow! My face is a ball magnet!

17:50.102 --> 17:52.098
Off you, my ball.

18:19.972 --> 18:25.609
Okay. It's 4 to 4. Next basket wins.
I need to go pee, but I'm not gonna!

18:28.728 --> 18:30.715
You're breathin' kinda heavy,
you wanna quit?

18:30.719 --> 18:34.071
I don't think so.
- Let's finish this.

18:41.763 --> 18:43.238
Great game, kid.

18:43.318 --> 18:46.852
Yeah for you.
I'm gonna be grounded for a month.

18:50.306 --> 18:52.353
Joshee, I still got it or what?

18:52.433 --> 18:54.754
Yeah you do. Hey, may I?

18:55.047 --> 18:56.759
Take it.

19:00.253 --> 19:02.315
Oh, Josh!

19:03.047 --> 19:06.523
Basketball, not my thing.

19:15.495 --> 19:20.798
Video games!
Joshee, am I holdin' this right?

19:20.799 --> 19:22.785
Let me see.

19:23.217 --> 19:25.145
Sucker.

19:26.749 --> 19:29.781
Hey Grammy.
Here.

19:30.603 --> 19:33.494
What's this?
- 200 dollars.

19:33.614 --> 19:35.850
For the fine you had to pay at the concert.

19:35.869 --> 19:40.280
I didn't say you had to pay me back.
- I-I know. I know. And look..

19:40.287 --> 19:43.374
as soon as mom and dad get home.
I'll tell 'em what happened.

19:45.781 --> 19:48.389
Where's a kid get this kinda money?

19:48.400 --> 19:52.423
I was savin' up for a new guitar.
It does.. I-it doesn't matter.

19:54.102 --> 19:55.582
Hi!
- We're home.

19:55.583 --> 19:58.578
Hey, hey! Welcome home!
Did you have a good time?

19:58.589 --> 20:01.851
Oh it was great, it was great.
Hey, how was yours with the boys?

20:04.706 --> 20:10.803
We had a lot of fun. Grammy and I played
some video games, a little Bingo.

20:10.805 --> 20:12.750
How 'bout you, Drake?
What'd you do?

20:12.753 --> 20:15.814
Actually there's something I gotta tell you.

20:16.800 --> 20:20.354
Friday night, I..
- Yeah?

20:20.425 --> 20:23.554
I went..
Look, this is kinda hard to tell you, but..

20:23.557 --> 20:26.363
Then I'll tell them.

20:29.103 --> 20:33.343
I beat Drake at basketball.
- What?!

20:35.474 --> 20:40.363
Sorry, Drake. But the truth is the truth.
That is what happened. Right?

20:40.596 --> 20:44.174
Yeah. She beat me bad.

20:45.497 --> 20:49.958
Grammy beat you at basketball!
- Hey, hey. Come on, don't laugh at me. I mean..

20:50.054 --> 20:54.375
she beat Josh at Bingo like six times in a row.

20:58.596 --> 21:01.373
Grammy beat you at basketball!

21:13.514 --> 21:15.878
Grape!
- Grape!

21:17.878 --> 21:21.671
Man, we got that down.
- Yeah, we do.

21:23.107 --> 21:27.250
Hey fellas, I'm about to take off.
Thanks for the fun weekend.

21:27.252 --> 21:31.181
Hey Grammy. Talk to me..
- What?

21:31.435 --> 21:35.346
How come you covered for me with mom and dad?
- I don't know..

21:35.523 --> 21:39.787
maybe I got a soft spot for musicians.

21:39.791 --> 21:44.691
Come on, you beat me. The deal was that I
tell mom and dad about the concert.

21:44.773 --> 21:48.875
And I saw that you were going to.
And that was good enough for me.

21:49.580 --> 21:51.623
Told you she was cool.

21:51.800 --> 21:55.648
Besides, you've been punished enough.
You got your butt beat by an old lady.

21:55.767 --> 21:59.961
Your not that old.
- Your a good kid.

22:01.274 --> 22:03.415
Come here Joshee, give me a hug.

22:09.046 --> 22:11.500
How 'bout one from you, Drakie?

22:11.609 --> 22:15.942
Come on.
They're free!

22:17.096 --> 22:20.544
Have a good trip home.
- I will.

22:21.510 --> 22:27.671
You, work on that jump shot.
You, work on not gettin' hit in the face.

22:27.678 --> 22:31.169
I'll do it.
- See you guys soon.

22:38.180 --> 22:41.739
What?
- You love my Grammy!

22:42.172 --> 22:45.332
Say it!
- I like her okay.

22:48.992 --> 22:52.706
Drake?
- She put somethin' on my back, didn't she?

23:03.283 --> 23:09.764
She gave me my 200 dollars back.
- And two dollars off your next haircut.

23:12.267 --> 23:14.609
I gotta go say thanks.

23:15.497 --> 23:18.473
Peace at last.

23:20.709 --> 23:23.065
It's good to be home.

23:29.052 --> 23:33.100
Will you not say that? She's my grandma.
- So?

23:33.101 --> 23:37.600
So, she's kinda your grandma too now.
We're all family.

23:37.603 --> 23:40.675
I've learned to love your twisted little sister.

23:41.877 --> 23:45.400
Why are you so hard on Drake?
- 'Cause I know his type.

23:45.401 --> 23:49.080
I dated a dozen musicians
before I met your granfather.

23:49.200 --> 23:54.169
I'm not sure I wanna think about
you dating a dozen musical men.

23:56.409 --> 24:03.041
Then I won't tell you about last Saturday night.
Good thing I got this new hip!

24:03.809 --> 24:08.073
Am I gonna see you on a commercial
for Grammies Gone Wild?
