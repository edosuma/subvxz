01:07.150 --> 01:09.903
to our official first day
of wedding planning.

Ooh! Champagne in the morning?

I love engaged DJ.

Oh.

01:21.372 --> 01:22.248
It's coffee.

It's a little more on-brand.

and chock-full of food that's free.

01:40.266 --> 01:43.853

triple wedding decisions together.

the rest of the engagement.

01:52.946 --> 01:54.405
Yeah, I'll drink to that.

01:57.534 --> 01:58.368

[growls]

02:36.197 --> 02:39.951
...I will be representing the grooms
at today's wedding expo.

02:40.660 --> 02:42.162
But wait, who made you the leader?

02:42.245 --> 02:43.079
I did.

02:44.914 --> 02:46.332
It is my job as the leader.

02:47.667 --> 02:49.836
You know,
I've got to start going to those meetings.

02:51.171 --> 02:55.133

I will be awash in cummerbunds,

02:55.300 --> 02:57.302
bow ties, and male Spanx.

You should come, Esteban.
You're looking a little fluffy.

Kimmy, we're not spending the night
at the wedding expo.

03:37.133 --> 03:38.885
No, this is my freebie bag.

03:40.970 --> 03:43.097
You know how much stuff they give away
at these things?

03:44.349 --> 03:45.934
Oh, that explains why we have

03:46.017 --> 03:48.228
an attic full of tiki torches
and crazy straws.

03:50.230 --> 03:52.899
When the power goes out,
we can throw a root beer party.

03:55.568 --> 03:57.779
Oh, no.
Mom's got her freebie bag out.

03:59.739 --> 04:01.074

No, off the luggage carousel
at the airport.

As soon as it goes around twice,
it's up for grabs.

Yeah, I don't think that's the rule.

04:36.150 --> 04:36.985
Aw.

Before you know it,
she'll start giving us attitude,

04:39.654 --> 04:42.323

when we cornered him in that alley.

04:44.534 --> 04:46.244
Oh. Mom, I'm going to audition too.

the soul of an artist.

something to work with.

I've been running my lines. Watch this.

05:13.229 --> 05:14.772
It's a non-speaking role. [chuckles]

05:15.940 --> 05:18.318
I've been trying to cast you
in that role for years.

05:19.527 --> 05:22.864
Okay, guys, don't forget you are all
meeting us later at the wedding expo

05:22.947 --> 05:23.823
to look at outfits.

05:23.906 --> 05:26.743
Pass, I've got to practice
for my chess club tournament.

05:27.243 --> 05:29.662

05:29.746 --> 05:31.205
there goes my entire day.

Excuse us, Maureen.
We still have some details to hash out.

07:39.917 --> 07:43.629
Okay, so we aren't exactly
on the same page,

07:43.713 --> 07:45.423
but that's why we're here.

07:45.965 --> 07:49.469
And I'm sure out of all this stuff,
there is something we can agree on.

07:54.599 --> 07:56.767
Maybe next time you can have
this discussion

07:56.851 --> 07:59.020
after you release me from this bag.

08:01.355 --> 08:03.941
Yeah, well, maybe next time,
you can pay the $5 entrance fee.

08:05.359 --> 08:06.360
Entrance fee?

How's chess life treating you?

08:23.085 --> 08:26.672
I'm working on a theoretical variation
on the Budapest Gambit.

08:27.632 --> 08:29.592
Oh, I forgot I was talking to a civilian.

08:32.053 --> 08:33.095
It's fine.

-Hey. How did the audition go?
-Hey.

08:37.725 --> 08:40.478
I think it went okay.
I mean, you never know with these things.

08:41.229 --> 08:43.105
But-- Oh, who am I kidding?

08:43.189 --> 08:46.359
I killed it, brought it back to life,
and then killed it again for fun.

08:50.988 --> 08:53.783
If it isn't Non-Speaking Tree number five.

08:54.825 --> 08:55.660
It was so weird.

08:55.743 --> 08:59.288
The director asked me to speak,
and then he asked me to sing,

08:59.497 --> 09:01.874
which is a form of speaking
with melody and rhythm.

09:03.876 --> 09:07.213
Look at you, one day in the theater
and already you're learning things.

09:08.548 --> 09:11.759
Yeah, it was pretty fun.
Usually when all eyes are on me at school,

09:11.842 --> 09:13.844
it's 'cause I'm accidentally wearing
Ramona's pants.

09:15.137 --> 09:17.139

-Oh!

09:18.349 --> 09:20.434
The director just e-mailed the cast list.

09:21.852 --> 09:23.104
Wait, this can't be right.

09:24.188 --> 09:25.898
I didn't get the leading player.

09:28.568 --> 09:29.777
I'm the understudy?

09:32.113 --> 09:33.197
Whoa!

09:33.281 --> 09:35.449
It says I got the leading player.

09:38.995 --> 09:41.706
Oh, boy. This play just got interesting.

09:43.374 --> 09:45.793
Okay, there has to be a mistake.

09:46.168 --> 09:47.545
You got the lead?

09:48.087 --> 09:50.590
I rehearsed for months
and now you're the star of the show.

09:50.673 --> 09:52.174
Now, Ramona, to be fair,

09:52.258 --> 09:55.219
I'm sure Jackson must have done something
to impress the director.

09:57.096 --> 10:00.516
Um, Jackson, did you do something
to impress the director?

10:02.810 --> 10:05.146
I don't know, I guess he said
I sung like an angel.

10:05.771 --> 10:07.565
But I assume he said that to everyone.

10:09.483 --> 10:10.318
Oh, please.

10:10.401 --> 10:13.529
A jock tries slumming it in theater
and everybody wants him?

10:13.613 --> 10:14.989
It's so early Glee.

10:18.075 --> 10:20.286
I guess I shouldn't tell her
I liked early Glee.

10:22.330 --> 10:24.999
I guess I shouldn't tell her I thought
I was auditioning for Cats.

10:29.337 --> 10:31.672
So, Max, what do you say?
You up for a little chess game?

10:32.798 --> 10:35.676
You're on. You've been way too confident
since my mom said yes.

10:42.725 --> 10:43.559

10:46.854 --> 10:48.522
Wait, what just happened?

10:48.606 --> 10:51.567
Dude, you fell for my trademarked
Steve Hale Four-Move Checkmate.

10:54.070 --> 10:57.657
[sighs] Yep, that's right. Steve Hale's
got some tricks up his sleeve.

10:59.075 --> 11:00.201
This is unbelievable.

11:00.868 --> 11:01.911
Max, what are you doing?

11:02.745 --> 11:05.081
What does it look like I'm doing?
I'm storming off in a huff.

11:10.002 --> 11:13.673
Kimberlina, I love this wedding expo.

11:14.131 --> 11:15.758
Did you get your teeth whitened?

11:17.510 --> 11:18.594
Yes.

11:20.262 --> 11:23.099
This place is like Disneyland for my face.

11:25.101 --> 11:28.229
Fernando, aren't you supposed to be here
looking at cummerbunds and bow ties

11:28.312 --> 11:29.271
for the he-wolf pack?

11:29.897 --> 11:33.526
Who can focus on the he-wolves
in this fabulous wonderland?

11:34.860 --> 11:37.697
I got a free facial and now I'm off
to cake tasting.

11:38.614 --> 11:42.910
I heard a rumor they have cake
that tastes like pie.

11:48.207 --> 11:49.959
Who wants to see what I just found?

11:50.209 --> 11:51.043
I do.

11:53.838 --> 11:55.881
Red roses.

11:56.924 --> 12:00.636
They're timeless and they're classic
and they're--

12:00.720 --> 12:01.679
Boring.

12:03.556 --> 12:06.350
I mean, they're too formal
for a wedding at the beach.

12:06.434 --> 12:09.854
No one is going to take their shoes off
at a wedding with red roses.

12:10.396 --> 12:13.107
Uh, who said anything about the beach?

12:13.315 --> 12:15.818
And no one is taking off their shoes
at my wedding.

12:16.902 --> 12:19.780
Yeah, you can't put a podiatrist
in a room full of bare feet.

12:20.906 --> 12:22.825
Steve will be distracted by every bunion.

12:24.910 --> 12:25.911
Exactly.

12:25.995 --> 12:28.456
It's like for me if there were
a bunch of dogs at the wedding.

12:28.539 --> 12:29.373
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

12:29.832 --> 12:31.625
We've got to have dogs at our wedding.

12:31.709 --> 12:33.627
Without dogs,
who will dance with the cats?

12:34.795 --> 12:38.424
No, no, we are not having dogs or cats
at the wedding, okay?

12:38.507 --> 12:41.427
But I will tell you what we are having
is a karaoke machine.

12:42.511 --> 12:43.846
Because it's not a wedding

12:43.929 --> 12:46.348
until I'm singing "When Doves Cry"
with someone's drunk cousin.

12:47.850 --> 12:50.519
So, no cats, but you can have doves
and drunk cousins?

12:51.437 --> 12:54.899
Okay, obviously we are disagreeing
on a lot of details,

12:54.982 --> 12:59.028
like where the wedding will be
and how tacky you two want it to be.

13:00.112 --> 13:01.530
We're tacky?

13:01.614 --> 13:03.699
You're wearing a tiara
around a convention center.

13:05.117 --> 13:06.952
Well, I am the queen of Christmas.

13:10.581 --> 13:11.415
Oh!

13:11.999 --> 13:13.793
Lady with tacky tiara.

13:15.211 --> 13:17.004
Must be DJ.

13:18.923 --> 13:21.300
Berta, from Berta's Bridal?

13:22.259 --> 13:24.386
Wait, this is the Berta?

is because I didn't know you could play.

by an 11-year-old not to move

I should drop out of the play.

to be someone I'm not.

15:23.923 --> 15:25.758

I'm not just a pretty face.

Hey, Jackson,
I've been thinking about the play.

15:52.409 --> 15:54.495
Yeah, Ramona. I've been thinking too.

15:54.578 --> 15:55.704
You should drop out.

15:55.788 --> 15:57.873
That's crazy, Jackson was just saying--

15:57.957 --> 15:59.667
Hold on, pretty boy.
I want to hear this.

16:01.377 --> 16:03.963
We both know you really don't care
about this play.

a better singer than you?

16:17.643 --> 16:18.978
No, I never thought that.

You have no idea how much effort it takes
to be the lead of a play.

you're going to end up quitting.

I'm definitely not doing that.

Chuck E. Cheese?

17:11.905 --> 17:14.742
No, dogs aren't allowed
at Chuck E. Cheese.

25:28.860 --> 25:30.362
Steph, you're getting married.

25:30.612 --> 25:31.780
It is a big deal.

25:32.531 --> 25:34.407
We all want it to be perfect.

25:36.535 --> 25:37.661
But at the end of the day...

25:38.745 --> 25:42.874
perfect isn't about table settings
and roses, it's...

25:43.416 --> 25:45.043
it's about the three of us

25:45.168 --> 25:48.255
making it to the end of the aisle,
without killing each other.

25:51.049 --> 25:53.593
From now on, we just have to compromise.

25:53.927 --> 25:54.886
And listen.

25:54.970 --> 25:55.804
Right.

25:56.513 --> 25:57.847
-[DJ] Aw.
-[Kimmy chuckles]

25:59.182 --> 26:00.016
Hmm.

26:00.100 --> 26:01.184
Kimmy, listen to me.

26:01.643 --> 26:03.520
You are not wearing that bird hat.

26:06.314 --> 26:08.608
Fine. DJ, you can wear it.
