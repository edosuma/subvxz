01:54.457 --> 01:58.191
Yo, Stano. These guys
don't mess around, <i>papi chulo.</i>

01:58.890 --> 02:02.224
Unless you got protection,
you'll be they blow-up doll.

02:10.690 --> 02:12.524
You still need somebody?

02:17.724 --> 02:19.857
Come on, baby! Come on.

02:23.657 --> 02:25.525
Come on, Stano!

02:42.557 --> 02:43.991
Aw, man!

03:03.457 --> 03:05.288
Yo! Come on, man.
You kidding me?

03:05.290 --> 03:07.522
- Yo, what's that?
- That's not right, man.

03:07.524 --> 03:09.124
That ain't right.

03:10.491 --> 03:12.690
Come on. Get up.

03:13.556 --> 03:16.590
- Come on. Get up, Sonny.
- Good eye, Sonny.

03:18.789 --> 03:20.754
Big swing. Big swing, Sonny.

03:20.756 --> 03:23.090
Take it on, Sonny.
Let's go. Big swing.

03:28.790 --> 03:30.190
Come on, Sonny.

03:44.289 --> 03:46.624
Nobody makes me
their fucking bitch!

05:07.324 --> 05:08.690
Stano!

07:33.656 --> 07:35.020
Sonny?

07:35.022 --> 07:37.621
- Hi, Eugene.
- My God.

07:37.623 --> 07:40.624
It is so good to see you.

07:41.389 --> 07:43.421
I couldn't tell by your letter

07:43.423 --> 07:46.087
whether it was this week or
next week you were coming home.

07:46.089 --> 07:48.087
Today. I got out today.

07:48.089 --> 07:50.054
How are you? You all right?

07:50.056 --> 07:53.588
Yeah. Yeah, I'm good.
Thanks.

07:53.590 --> 07:55.358
- You?
- Good.

07:56.256 --> 07:58.453
You, um...

07:58.455 --> 08:00.257
- Do you have the keys?
- Of course.

08:00.722 --> 08:01.787
Here you go.

08:01.789 --> 08:03.588
Thanks.

08:03.590 --> 08:07.390
You know, your mother wanted so
much to stay alive for this day.

08:08.157 --> 08:10.291
It's such a shame
she didn't make it.

08:15.989 --> 08:19.855
Well, if you need anything,
just knock.

08:19.857 --> 08:21.258
Thanks.

11:12.289 --> 11:13.757
Hi, Mrs. Murphy?

11:15.090 --> 11:16.557
It's me, Sonny Stano.

11:17.990 --> 11:20.057
Now, I hope it's okay
that I'm here.

11:20.956 --> 11:22.689
For the past 17 years...

11:24.090 --> 11:27.490
I just wanted to tell you how much
that I wish that night never happened.

11:30.057 --> 11:32.553
I wrote you all these letters,
and they were all returned...

11:32.555 --> 11:35.157
How dare you
show your face here.

11:35.756 --> 11:38.120
No, Mrs. Murphy, please.
I just got out.

11:38.122 --> 11:42.721
And all I wanted to do was come here
and tell you how sorry I am for every...

11:53.189 --> 11:55.855
Any injuries
prior to your release?

11:55.857 --> 11:57.488
- No.
- Okay.

11:57.490 --> 12:00.855
Any, uh, use of drugs or
alcohol in the last 72 hours?

12:00.857 --> 12:02.554
No.

12:02.556 --> 12:06.287
Uh, any contact with an officer
of the law since your release?

12:06.289 --> 12:09.121
- Um... No.
- Good.

12:09.123 --> 12:12.024
Okay, so here are the rules.
You break one, you go back in.

12:12.556 --> 12:16.055
No staying out past 10:00.
No leaving the state. No drugs.

12:16.057 --> 12:19.453
You pee in a cup for me every time you
come and see me as a friendly offering.

12:19.455 --> 12:21.489
You pray like hell
it comes back clean.

12:24.388 --> 12:27.954
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh...

12:27.956 --> 12:30.921
Oh. Major league contract
and you blew it, huh?

12:30.923 --> 12:32.556
Asshole.

12:33.422 --> 12:36.920
Oh. Tomorrow you start work
at the fish store.

12:36.922 --> 12:38.390
Yeah, about that.
I, uh...

12:38.922 --> 12:41.353
I was hoping maybe
I could have a little time

12:41.355 --> 12:43.754
- to find something better.
- Better?

12:43.756 --> 12:46.454
No. The parole deal is for the fish store.
What are you talking about?

12:46.456 --> 12:48.654
I just thought
that maybe I...

12:48.656 --> 12:51.221
I could find something
in management.

12:52.823 --> 12:55.521
Really? Management?

12:55.523 --> 12:57.620
What are you gonna manage?
A hotel?

12:57.622 --> 13:01.187
A car dealership?
Or maybe a three-star restaurant?

13:01.189 --> 13:02.587
You couldn't manage a bodega.

13:02.589 --> 13:04.454
You barely have
a high school diploma.

13:04.456 --> 13:06.254
You have absolutely
no skills to offer

13:06.256 --> 13:08.120
into a workforce
that's already overcrowded.

13:08.122 --> 13:11.286
Be glad your friend with the fish
store stuck his neck out for you.

13:11.288 --> 13:12.855
Second chances
are hard to come by.

13:12.857 --> 13:14.421
You know the kid
whose life you took?

13:14.423 --> 13:16.353
He sure as hell isn't
getting one.

13:16.355 --> 13:17.923
Be grateful you are.

13:19.288 --> 13:20.856
Now go pee in the cup.

13:44.856 --> 13:46.821
I'm looking
for Joey Costenza.

13:46.823 --> 13:48.253
- The boss?
- Yeah.

13:48.255 --> 13:50.389
- His office is right there.
- Thanks.

13:55.223 --> 13:57.286
Oh.

13:57.288 --> 14:00.654
There he is.
Man, look at you.

14:00.656 --> 14:02.253
You look great,
you son of a bitch.

14:02.255 --> 14:03.823
Hey, you don't look
so bad yourself.

14:04.056 --> 14:06.653
Thanks. I mean, ain't got nothing on you.
Never did, right?

14:06.655 --> 14:09.353
Man. It's good...
It's good to see you.

14:09.355 --> 14:11.287
Good to see you out, Sonny.

14:11.289 --> 14:14.087
I mean,
out here and... free.

14:14.089 --> 14:16.086
Thanks for writing the letter
to the parole board.

14:16.088 --> 14:18.721
No, I'm, I'm not kidding, man.
It meant everything.

14:18.723 --> 14:20.988
If it wasn't for that,
I don't think I'd be out right now.

14:20.990 --> 14:23.021
Don't worry about it.
We'll help you get on your feet.

14:23.023 --> 14:24.687
You have to start
from the bottom,

14:24.689 --> 14:26.554
but the guys on the dock
will show you the ropes.

14:26.556 --> 14:28.987
You got any of that, uh,
signing bonus money left? No?

14:28.989 --> 14:32.154
Nah, it all went to the kid's
family, to the lawyer.

14:32.156 --> 14:33.791
Yeah, right. Right.

14:35.155 --> 14:36.990
Oh. Check this out.

14:37.889 --> 14:40.553
Paid 1,500
for this Rod Carew bat.

14:40.555 --> 14:42.089
Go ahead. Give it a swing.

14:42.489 --> 14:44.623
- Nah...
- Go ahead. I don't give a shit.

14:45.022 --> 14:46.087
Nah, it's okay.

14:46.089 --> 14:47.323
No?

14:48.388 --> 14:49.821
All right.

14:49.823 --> 14:52.487
Hey. I'm gonna sponsor
a summer league.

14:52.489 --> 14:54.589
You wanna play?

14:54.789 --> 14:57.453
- I don't know.
- The Surf Club paid COD, Joey.

14:57.455 --> 14:59.387
- Half check, half cash.
- All right. That's good.

14:59.389 --> 15:02.120
Very good. You stop by my place,
take the trash out of the garage?

15:02.122 --> 15:03.988
- Yeah, it's all done. All done.
- All right. Good.

15:03.990 --> 15:07.019
Hey, this is Sonny. Good friend of mine.
Just got outta jail.

15:07.021 --> 15:09.222
Oh. Congratulations.

15:09.423 --> 15:12.687
We grew up together. Used to play ball
together. Little league, high school.

15:12.689 --> 15:15.823
This guy's got ice in his veins
when he's up at bat.

15:17.055 --> 15:18.321
Yeah.

15:18.323 --> 15:20.489
You were king once.
Remember, Sonny?

15:21.589 --> 15:23.022
Yeah.

15:23.990 --> 15:26.087
What do you want? You're hanging around.
I see the face.

15:26.089 --> 15:28.053
Look, I know I said
that I can work on Sunday.

15:28.055 --> 15:30.621
But I forgot, Joey, that it's
my daughter's birthday,

15:30.623 --> 15:32.488
and it's... they said
it's gonna rain on Saturday.

15:32.490 --> 15:33.957
- So I just wanted...
- Wait, wait, wait.

15:34.255 --> 15:36.855
I gotta clear out my attic.
I just got the dumpster delivered.

15:36.857 --> 15:38.753
I understand.
It's just this one time, Joey.

15:38.755 --> 15:40.621
No. I'm gonna give you
more days.

15:40.623 --> 15:42.553
Wanna know why?
He's gonna be my new swing guy.

15:42.555 --> 15:44.688
- Give him the keys.
- Wait, you're firing me?

15:44.690 --> 15:47.123
Yeah, I'm firing you.
Give him the keys, Bobby.

15:47.622 --> 15:49.420
Know what, Joey?
Why don't you go fuck yourself.

15:49.422 --> 15:50.821
- Whoa.
- Nice. Very nice.

15:50.823 --> 15:52.390
- That's why you're fired.
- Yeah.

15:53.188 --> 15:55.187
- It's not 'cause of me, is it?
- Don't worry about him.

15:55.189 --> 15:57.888
Here, Sonny. You're my new swing guy.
All right?

15:57.890 --> 15:59.588
So you do half days
loading the dock,

15:59.590 --> 16:01.787
half days, you know,
do some personal stuff for me.

16:01.789 --> 16:04.087
This'll be good, man.
It'll be like old times. Me and you.

16:04.089 --> 16:07.488
Get to hang out.
Good to see you.

16:07.490 --> 16:10.187
- All right.
- Yeah.

16:10.189 --> 16:11.524
Thanks, man.

16:22.056 --> 16:23.123
Shit.

16:24.156 --> 16:25.457
I'm sorry.

16:31.222 --> 16:32.955
That's $26.40.

16:35.389 --> 16:37.624
- How much you said it was?
- $26.40.

16:39.223 --> 16:41.653
- Can I put some of it back?
- What do you wanna put back?

16:41.655 --> 16:43.623
I don't know,
like six dollars' worth.

16:44.289 --> 16:45.354
How much is the coffee?

16:45.356 --> 16:47.724
Uh, um... $5.65.

16:48.890 --> 16:51.357
- How about the lettuce?
- Two dollars.

16:52.690 --> 16:54.157
What about the tomatoes?

16:54.922 --> 16:57.589
Rosita, it's okay.
Put it with my stuff.

17:02.522 --> 17:03.989
Hi, Sonny.

17:05.289 --> 17:06.357
Hi.

17:06.989 --> 17:09.119
No. No, no, no. No, no.
I'll put it back.

17:09.122 --> 17:10.923
- No, no. It's okay. It's okay.
- No, I...

17:15.522 --> 17:17.819
<i>Thanks for
bailing me out back there.</i>

17:17.821 --> 17:20.019
- I'll pay you back.
- No, it's fine.

17:20.021 --> 17:23.390
- Will you let me carry your bag?
- My God. It's okay.

17:25.790 --> 17:27.123
It's good to see you.

17:28.454 --> 17:29.922
It's good to see you too.

17:30.823 --> 17:32.721
How long
since you've been back home?

17:32.723 --> 17:35.890
Just a couple weeks.
Still trying to get my bearings.

17:36.589 --> 17:40.022
You'll get it.
You just need time, I guess.

17:40.655 --> 17:42.022
You look great.

17:43.355 --> 17:44.953
How you been?

17:44.955 --> 17:46.721
I've been great.

17:46.723 --> 17:48.123
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

17:49.956 --> 17:53.119
Sorry about the smell.
I'm working for Joey Fish now.

17:53.121 --> 17:55.990
Just temporary till
I can line something else up.

17:56.790 --> 17:58.554
- You work around here?
- Yeah.

17:58.556 --> 18:01.053
I teach Spanish at Columbus.

18:01.055 --> 18:02.887
Wow.

18:02.889 --> 18:05.820
You mean, you're, like, Señora Ramirez now?
I mean, to the kids?

18:05.822 --> 18:08.589
If they know what is good for them.

18:10.655 --> 18:12.156
I'm that way.

18:13.356 --> 18:14.757
Good luck, Sonny.

18:15.989 --> 18:17.090
Angela.

18:19.555 --> 18:21.590
I just want you to know
how sorry I am.

18:22.790 --> 18:25.190
About everything.
About hurting you.

18:25.722 --> 18:29.420
You gotta understand. It wasn't that
I didn't want to see you anymore.

18:29.422 --> 18:31.055
I just wanted you to move on.

18:33.555 --> 18:34.855
I did.

18:40.755 --> 18:45.421
Hello? Um... No, no, no, baby.
I didn't forget.

18:45.423 --> 18:47.621
Okay. Yeah. Pick the movie.

18:47.623 --> 18:49.420
Yeah. Be there soon. No.

18:49.422 --> 18:51.389
No, not that one, please!

18:51.689 --> 18:53.856
Okay.

18:54.922 --> 18:58.790
All she wants to do is
watch <i>High School Musical.</i>

18:59.389 --> 19:00.420
How old is she?

19:00.422 --> 19:01.855
She's ten.

19:02.289 --> 19:03.554
You got any more?

19:03.556 --> 19:05.956
No, just one. The best one.

19:09.089 --> 19:11.123
Bye, Sonny.
Good luck with everything.

19:42.388 --> 19:43.689
Hey, kid.

19:45.556 --> 19:47.753
What? I gained that much weight?

19:47.755 --> 19:49.588
You don't know
who the hell I am?

19:49.590 --> 19:51.022
What do you want?

19:51.522 --> 19:52.920
I heard you was home.

19:52.922 --> 19:54.922
I wanted to come by
and say hello.

19:57.754 --> 20:00.923
Ah, heard about your mom.
I'm sorry.

20:04.422 --> 20:05.457
Still coaching?

20:06.722 --> 20:08.953
Yep. Thirty years in the minors.
At least it's with the Yankees.

20:08.955 --> 20:12.322
If you're gonna get stuck on the farm,
they're the ones to get stuck with.

20:13.056 --> 20:15.220
I've been waiting
a long time for this.

20:15.222 --> 20:16.919
I have some things
I wanted to say.

20:16.921 --> 20:18.689
Why didn't you
just say 'em then?

20:19.289 --> 20:21.386
Ossining's five stops
up the Metro-North.

20:21.388 --> 20:23.621
Look. I'm here now, aren't I?

20:23.623 --> 20:25.157
I mean, that's saying something.

20:26.956 --> 20:28.189
You wanna go for a walk?

20:29.423 --> 20:30.856
Come on. Let's take a walk.

20:31.822 --> 20:33.653
I must have written
like ten letters.

20:33.655 --> 20:36.588
But everything I wrote
just sounded wrong.

20:36.590 --> 20:38.022
So I would just...

20:38.888 --> 20:40.386
I wanted to feel sorry for you.

20:40.388 --> 20:42.187
Man, I don't want you
to feel sorry for me.

20:42.189 --> 20:44.654
I never wanted anybody
to feel sorry for me.

20:44.656 --> 20:47.453
If that's what this is about,
I don't need your pity, man.

20:47.455 --> 20:50.054
I just thought maybe it
all happened for a reason.

20:50.056 --> 20:51.723
It didn't happen for a reason.

20:53.590 --> 20:56.553
It didn't happen for any reason other than I
made the biggest mistake of my life that night.

20:56.555 --> 20:59.022
You know, there's no path.
I'm sick of this.

21:00.323 --> 21:03.786
There's only screwups and then
consequences afterwards.

21:03.788 --> 21:05.320
All right. So be it.

21:05.322 --> 21:07.720
Anyways, you working?
You got something going on?

21:07.722 --> 21:10.554
Yeah, my buddy hooked me up
with a job at his fish business.

21:10.556 --> 21:11.820
He's got a big warehouse.

21:11.822 --> 21:13.157
Training me...

21:14.188 --> 21:15.886
- What?
- Fish?

21:15.888 --> 21:17.624
What the hell do you know
about fish?

21:18.222 --> 21:20.420
What do you mean? It's a job.
It's a steady job.

21:20.422 --> 21:23.087
All right, all right.
What happens if I had a job for you?

21:23.089 --> 21:25.053
- Doing what?
- In baseball.

21:25.055 --> 21:27.154
I'll get you on salary
as one of my assistants.

21:27.156 --> 21:28.652
Come on, man. Nah.
I'm not interested.

21:28.654 --> 21:30.652
You're not interested
in baseball?

21:30.654 --> 21:32.087
You used to eat,
sleep and drink it.

21:32.089 --> 21:33.919
Look, I know what you're doing.

21:33.921 --> 21:35.789
Okay? And I appreciate it. I do.

21:36.255 --> 21:38.955
But me and baseball...
we're done.

21:40.755 --> 21:42.157
I gotta grow up.

21:45.255 --> 21:47.256
I appreciate you coming
out to see me.

21:47.622 --> 21:48.855
I do.

21:50.590 --> 21:51.890
We're good.

21:55.888 --> 21:58.322
Nobody grows up in baseball!

22:56.622 --> 22:58.853
Hey! Sonny Stan.

22:58.855 --> 23:00.119
The home run man.

23:00.121 --> 23:02.053
- How's things working out?
- Good.

23:02.055 --> 23:04.287
Good. You know what?
I never got your cell phone number.

23:04.289 --> 23:07.120
Oh, yeah. Well, uh...
I don't really have one.

23:07.122 --> 23:08.954
That's right.
You don't got a cell phone.

23:08.956 --> 23:11.119
- Well, we gotta get you one.
- How come?

23:11.121 --> 23:14.488
Because everyone has one, and what
if I gotta get ahold of you, Sonny?

23:14.490 --> 23:18.990
Hey, Flocko, do me a favor. Keep your
shit clean. We got inspections tomorrow.

23:19.489 --> 23:22.855
You can use this one. I mean, the screen
is cracked, but I'm sure it still works.

23:23.622 --> 23:26.220
You know, I don't even know where
to begin with one of these things.

23:26.222 --> 23:29.286
- Just go find a tutorial online.
- Right. Okay.

23:29.288 --> 23:31.053
I need you to do a few things
for me right now.

23:31.055 --> 23:32.156
- Yeah, sure.
- All right, good.

23:32.754 --> 23:35.286
Run to my car.
There's dirty gym clothes in the back.

23:35.288 --> 23:37.753
I can't take 'em home 'cause my
wife, she just breaks my balls.

23:37.755 --> 23:39.819
There's a laundromat around the corner.
You drop it off.

23:39.821 --> 23:42.488
There's a hot Puerto Rican girl.
She's gonna take care of you.

23:42.490 --> 23:44.887
- Okay.
- Oh, and then stop by my house.

23:44.889 --> 23:48.119
You know our damn landscapers never showed up
knowing that I got people coming tomorrow?

23:48.121 --> 23:51.389
What a bunch of shit. So I need you
to go there and mow the lawn for me.

23:52.922 --> 23:54.153
Sonny.

23:54.155 --> 23:55.820
You're okay with that, right?

23:55.822 --> 23:57.653
Yeah, sure. 'Course.

23:57.655 --> 24:00.653
By the way, your, uh, your parole
officer called me this morning.

24:00.655 --> 24:02.990
You know, asked
how you're doing on the job.

24:03.423 --> 24:05.023
I told him
you were banging it up.

24:06.156 --> 24:07.923
- Thanks, Joey.
- Yeah.

24:09.156 --> 24:10.953
Answer me this though.

24:10.955 --> 24:13.386
How come nobody looks at each
other when they talk anymore?

24:13.388 --> 24:17.253
It's that freakin' Facebook,
Insta-sham, Twitter bullshit.

24:17.255 --> 24:20.886
It's ridiculous. You know,
people even pick up chicks on that thing.

24:20.888 --> 24:22.889
It's putting me out of business.

24:23.689 --> 24:24.756
Hey, hon. What'll you have?

24:25.189 --> 24:26.986
I'll have a beer, please.
Thanks.

24:26.988 --> 24:29.953
- A beer, right?
- Yeah.

24:47.156 --> 24:49.156
'Scuse me, but are you a thief?

24:50.555 --> 24:54.120
'Cause you must have stolen the stars from
the sky and put 'em right in your eyes.

24:56.988 --> 24:58.423
Seriously?

24:59.622 --> 25:00.819
Is that your A game?

25:00.821 --> 25:02.122
That line used to work.

25:04.589 --> 25:05.956
A long time ago.

25:07.388 --> 25:09.222
So, you from the neighborhood?

25:12.889 --> 25:16.453
Yeah. I, uh, I went
to Columbus and everything.

25:16.455 --> 25:17.489
Me too.

25:17.688 --> 25:19.452
When'd you graduate?

25:19.454 --> 25:21.488
Probably before you were born.

25:22.488 --> 25:25.354
I was born in '94.
I'm a little older than you think.

25:25.356 --> 25:27.623
I think I'm a little bit older
than you think.

25:29.222 --> 25:30.286
So what do you do?

25:30.288 --> 25:32.190
I'm in food.

25:32.822 --> 25:34.587
Food, uh, management.

25:34.589 --> 25:36.253
Like restaurants?

25:36.255 --> 25:38.388
Like behind the scenes.

25:38.888 --> 25:41.353
So how does that work?

25:41.355 --> 25:43.453
Well, uh...

25:43.455 --> 25:46.455
I mainly work
in retail products.

25:46.856 --> 25:51.223
Uh, high quality, uh... seafood.

25:51.689 --> 25:53.189
That's cool, I guess.

25:53.589 --> 25:55.619
You know, me and my friend,
we wanna open a restaurant.

25:55.621 --> 25:58.054
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah. It's called Picnic.

25:58.056 --> 25:59.289
Hey, Sonny.

26:00.421 --> 26:01.523
Tommy.

26:02.089 --> 26:04.190
Heard you went by to my mother's
the other day.

26:04.888 --> 26:07.623
I gotta say,
it takes some balls.

26:10.222 --> 26:11.989
Yeah, I just stopped by
to tell her that...

26:12.722 --> 26:14.923
that I wish
that that night never happened.

26:16.856 --> 26:18.056
Oh, well, it did.

26:18.689 --> 26:21.923
And you're still here,
and my brother's in the ground.

26:22.988 --> 26:26.586
Hey, maybe you guys should
take this reunion outside.

26:26.588 --> 26:28.556
There ain't gonna be
no trouble from me.

26:29.288 --> 26:31.853
After 17 years in the joint,
where you gonna go?

26:31.855 --> 26:35.089
What could you possibly do,
you piece of shit loser?

26:37.989 --> 26:42.656
Sonny, you know, maybe it's gonna take a
while for people to get used to you back.

26:43.255 --> 26:47.257
You know, maybe you should, like, lay low for
a while, you know? You know what I mean?

26:56.155 --> 26:57.623
You ready for this, fish man?

27:00.921 --> 27:02.452
Whoo! Yeah!

27:02.454 --> 27:04.854
Wow.
Mr. Monte!

27:04.856 --> 27:07.320
You weren't kidding when you said
you upped your golf game, huh?

27:07.322 --> 27:09.221
You're falling behind,
little Joey.

27:09.223 --> 27:10.854
Make this one pretty.

27:10.856 --> 27:11.986
Yeah. You know I will.

27:11.988 --> 27:14.555
Hey, Sonny, give me a six iron.

27:15.855 --> 27:18.422
Ah, this is a par three,
big guy.

27:23.521 --> 27:25.987
Nope. Nope.

27:25.989 --> 27:27.120
Not that one either.

27:27.122 --> 27:29.157
We call that the wedge.

27:30.089 --> 27:31.653
Where'd you find this gorilla?

27:31.655 --> 27:34.254
We were short on caddies.
Sonny works for me.

27:34.256 --> 27:35.887
Golf is not his thing, so...

27:35.889 --> 27:37.756
Uh, yeah, no shit, Sherlock.

27:38.354 --> 27:40.688
You know what is his game?
Baseball.

27:41.022 --> 27:42.452
Yeah.
This guy was major stuff.

27:42.454 --> 27:43.886
- Signed to the Yanks.
- Really?

27:43.888 --> 27:45.352
- Yeah. Yeah.
- No shit?

27:45.354 --> 27:47.855
- Hey, man, you were a Yankee?
- Almost.

27:48.522 --> 27:50.157
So, what the hell happened?

27:50.722 --> 27:51.790
Killed a guy.

27:56.788 --> 27:58.588
He's a pisser!

27:58.889 --> 28:02.156
You know, Sonny,
you're a pisser.

28:02.856 --> 28:05.389
Did I ever tell you
what a real pisser you are?

28:06.287 --> 28:07.887
He didn't really kill a guy,
right?

28:07.889 --> 28:09.321
No, he's full of shit.

28:12.321 --> 28:14.055
Right there, that's it!

28:30.888 --> 28:32.556
Yeah, that's nice, right there!

28:44.221 --> 28:47.353
Not a single miss,
boys!

28:47.355 --> 28:49.090
Looking good, looking good!

28:59.789 --> 29:01.789
Hey,
put your helmet on, all right?

29:10.122 --> 29:11.556
Check him out, man.

29:12.822 --> 29:15.587
Oh, yeah! That's what
I'm talking about! Right there!

29:21.555 --> 29:22.922
All right, you're up.

29:23.221 --> 29:25.419
Come on.
Keep your eye on the ball.

29:25.421 --> 29:26.855
Just like
we went over yesterday.

29:29.088 --> 29:30.689
Oh, yeah!

29:38.422 --> 29:40.556
Little hustle!
A little hustle out there!

29:43.121 --> 29:45.388
Keep moving, keep moving!

29:51.021 --> 29:52.686
Everything's cool with your PO?

29:52.688 --> 29:54.453
- Yeah, yeah. Of course.
- All right, good.

29:54.455 --> 29:56.220
You go see Pete
and he'll dress you.

29:56.222 --> 29:58.120
- Pete's still here?
- Everyone's still here.

29:58.122 --> 29:59.623
Hey.

30:01.889 --> 30:03.656
That's Hirohito Nakahara.

30:04.155 --> 30:07.054
Himself.
He's rehabbin' his knee.

30:07.056 --> 30:09.519
Upstairs is trying to squeeze
another season out of him.

30:09.521 --> 30:11.053
But I'm afraid he might be done.

30:11.055 --> 30:12.486
That guy's a legend.

30:12.488 --> 30:15.055
What's he, like,
48 hits away from 3,000?

30:15.955 --> 30:17.819
I thought you were all done
with baseball.

30:17.821 --> 30:19.786
I was in prison,
not on a different planet.

30:19.788 --> 30:22.655
Yeah. Come on,
let's go see the yard.

30:25.089 --> 30:26.122
<i>This Scaleri?</i>

30:26.754 --> 30:28.954
Jesus, that guy was old
when I was here.

30:28.956 --> 30:31.520
Yeah. Well,
where else is he gonna go?

30:31.522 --> 30:33.955
Hey, Buzzy!
Come here.

30:38.056 --> 30:39.419
Stano, yeah.

30:39.421 --> 30:41.220
- You remember me?
- Of course I do.

30:41.222 --> 30:42.453
How are you, buddy?

30:42.455 --> 30:43.723
Good. How you doing?

30:44.120 --> 30:47.687
Stano, I got a story
no one ever heard before, kid.

30:47.689 --> 30:50.322
This was 1974.

30:51.455 --> 30:53.953
Uh, we were doing terrible
as a team.

30:53.955 --> 30:55.953
We'd lost 14 in a row.

30:55.955 --> 30:58.022
Lenny was on third base.

30:58.689 --> 31:01.653
Tied two-two, the game was tied.

31:01.655 --> 31:04.819
I got up.
I hit a great fly ball.

31:04.821 --> 31:06.987
- Great fly ball.
- Right? A great fly ball.

31:06.989 --> 31:09.320
He tagged up, he scores.

31:09.322 --> 31:13.385
It was the shot heard
round... the corner.

31:13.387 --> 31:14.787
You get it?

31:14.789 --> 31:16.719
You're looking good.

31:16.721 --> 31:19.153
Thanks.
You're looking good too.

31:19.155 --> 31:21.153
- Oh, good.
- Yeah.

31:21.155 --> 31:22.686
You don't look so good.

31:22.688 --> 31:24.854
Hey, listen.

31:24.856 --> 31:27.253
Stano's gonna help us
with that Manny kid.

31:27.255 --> 31:29.956
Thank you.

31:32.187 --> 31:33.455
What Manny kid?

31:34.489 --> 31:36.419
That kid
right out there,

31:36.421 --> 31:38.285
with the stuff crawling
off his head.

31:38.287 --> 31:40.589
Manny! Manny!

31:41.554 --> 31:45.419
Talented kid. They sunk a ton of money
into him. But he acts like an asshole.

31:45.421 --> 31:48.790
Had to bail him out of a bar fight
the other night. He's killing me.

31:49.488 --> 31:50.953
<i>Que lo que,</i> Coach?

31:50.955 --> 31:53.252
Manny, I want you to meet
Sonny Stano.

31:53.254 --> 31:56.253
He played right here in our beautiful
little park a little while back.

31:56.255 --> 31:58.919
- One of the best we ever had.
- <i>Que pasó?</i> You get hurt?

31:58.921 --> 32:01.854
Doesn't matter what happened.
You can learn a lot from Sonny.

32:01.856 --> 32:03.620
I want you two
to get to know each other.

32:03.622 --> 32:05.919
- Why?
- Because I said so!

32:05.921 --> 32:08.285
Do you need a goddamn
explanation for everything I say?

32:08.287 --> 32:09.686
Chill, chill, chill.

32:09.688 --> 32:11.553
You know Manny.
Manny's up for anything.

32:11.555 --> 32:14.085
Manny's all about commitment.
All about better.

32:14.087 --> 32:16.186
Manny's up for anything that
takes him to the next level.

32:16.188 --> 32:19.623
And besides, there's
a lot to learn from old guys.

32:34.388 --> 32:36.656
I'm in, man. See you.

32:37.187 --> 32:38.321
Hey, Manny.

32:39.655 --> 32:42.786
Listen, man, uh... I'm not trying
to push my life on you, you know?

32:42.788 --> 32:46.755
They called me in.
So maybe you learn something from me.

32:47.388 --> 32:49.489
Maybe I learn something
from you. Cool?

32:56.322 --> 32:57.790
Good talk.

33:02.055 --> 33:03.219
Hey.

33:03.221 --> 33:04.655
Sonny, what are you doing here?

33:05.120 --> 33:06.255
I brought you your money.

33:07.088 --> 33:09.756
- For what?
- For the other day at the market.

33:11.355 --> 33:13.119
No, it's completely unnecessary.

33:13.121 --> 33:15.423
It's completely necessary
for me.

33:18.055 --> 33:19.989
And I also wanted to ask
your advice.

33:21.287 --> 33:23.186
- Advice?
- Yeah, I'm, uh...

33:23.188 --> 33:25.653
I'm thinking of taking
some business classes.

33:25.655 --> 33:27.052
You know,
so I can get a good job

33:27.054 --> 33:29.054
till I open my own business
one day.

33:29.555 --> 33:31.119
What kind of business?

33:31.121 --> 33:32.587
I'm thinking wholesale.

33:32.589 --> 33:34.619
Don't you do wholesale
at the fish market?

33:34.621 --> 33:35.888
I don't really work there
anymore.

33:36.621 --> 33:40.988
I got this, like, consultant job
with a minor league ball club.

33:42.522 --> 33:45.185
I think it's great. Baseball.

33:45.187 --> 33:48.553
It's like, it's who you are.
It's who you always were.

33:48.555 --> 33:50.887
Yeah, I don't know.
The pay's not very good.

33:50.889 --> 33:52.918
Which is why I need
to start taking these classes.

33:52.920 --> 33:54.587
Seeing that you're a teacher,
I figured

33:54.589 --> 33:56.118
maybe you can give me
some pointers.

33:56.120 --> 33:58.885
Well, yeah, go inside.
They have some student forms.

33:58.887 --> 34:01.886
They're pretty self-explanatory.
Ask for Miss Lupe. She'll help...

34:01.888 --> 34:03.656
I'm gonna be
straight with you.

34:05.288 --> 34:06.989
I'm feelin' really lost.

34:08.722 --> 34:10.222
When I was inside, I'd...

34:10.955 --> 34:13.652
I'd see all these guys leave,
and they'd come right back in.

34:13.654 --> 34:15.790
And I never understood why
until now.

34:17.655 --> 34:20.656
I could just...
just use some help.

34:24.154 --> 34:26.420
Sonny, I would really like
to help you,

34:26.422 --> 34:30.253
but, you know, my schedule's
just super tight right now.

34:30.255 --> 34:31.520
Between my job and...

34:36.420 --> 34:38.118
<i>Hola, Mami!</i>

34:38.120 --> 34:39.155
Hi, Mom.

34:40.221 --> 34:41.452
How was school?

34:41.454 --> 34:42.688
Good.

34:43.855 --> 34:45.587
Do you have homework?

34:45.589 --> 34:47.719
- Did it in class.
- You better have finished it all

34:47.721 --> 34:49.554
because I'm gonna check it
later.

34:50.387 --> 34:52.621
Melissa,
this is my friend, Sonny.

34:53.355 --> 34:55.623
- Hi.
- Sonny, this is Melissa.

34:56.522 --> 34:58.389
And you remember Billy, right?

34:58.754 --> 35:00.655
Oh, man,
that's your cousin.

35:01.187 --> 35:02.320
He became a cop?

35:02.322 --> 35:03.553
Billy.

35:03.555 --> 35:05.252
You remember Sonny Stano.

35:05.254 --> 35:06.686
I do. Yeah.

35:06.688 --> 35:08.054
How you doin', Billy?

35:10.387 --> 35:11.921
Can we go home now?

35:12.187 --> 35:14.185
She's really tired today.

35:14.187 --> 35:17.320
Why don't you take her home. Hmm?
I'll catch up with you guys later.

35:17.322 --> 35:21.252
Yeah. Don't forget to go back
there and get your forms.

35:21.254 --> 35:22.589
Thanks.

35:27.187 --> 35:28.819
So.

35:28.821 --> 35:30.155
You're back, huh?

35:31.154 --> 35:32.255
Yeah.

35:32.820 --> 35:36.189
How much time you end up doin'
for killing that kid?

35:37.621 --> 35:38.919
Nine.

35:38.921 --> 35:40.656
Another nine for staying alive.

35:41.555 --> 35:43.122
What're you doin' here?

35:43.522 --> 35:47.018
I just asked Angela for some
help with this idea that I have.

35:47.020 --> 35:50.185
Listen, um, don't try
any bullshit while you're here.

35:50.187 --> 35:51.686
- Okay?
- No, man.

35:51.688 --> 35:53.552
I ran into your cousin
at the market the other day.

35:53.554 --> 35:57.119
I will not see her get hurt again.
Do you understand me?

35:57.121 --> 35:59.918
No, I think you got me wrong.
I'm not trying to pull anything.

35:59.920 --> 36:02.888
I don't give a shit.
Just stay away from her.

36:03.654 --> 36:05.789
Angela made her mistakes.

36:06.655 --> 36:08.055
You were the first.

36:08.622 --> 36:10.189
I won't allow another one.

36:11.154 --> 36:15.221
Just believe me, I'm really not
trying to hurt anybody ever again.

36:39.388 --> 36:41.289
<i>Backing him back up to first...</i>

36:45.522 --> 36:47.852
<i>And here's the wind
and the pitch...</i>

36:47.854 --> 36:49.953
<i>Oh! Martinez connects!</i>

36:49.955 --> 36:53.285
<i>It's looking good,
it's going high, a monster shot!</i>

36:53.287 --> 36:55.153
<i>Back, back, back!</i>

36:55.155 --> 36:57.319
<i>And it is gone!</i>

36:57.321 --> 36:58.852
<i>Out of the park!</i>

36:58.854 --> 37:02.586
<i>Wow! This youngster
really jumped right in.</i>

37:04.555 --> 37:08.022
Your drug test comin' back
negative, that's good.

37:08.753 --> 37:11.186
Any contact
with an officer of the law?

37:11.188 --> 37:12.288
No.

37:13.088 --> 37:14.121
Yeah.

37:14.621 --> 37:15.686
When?

37:15.688 --> 37:17.053
Couple days ago.

37:17.055 --> 37:18.953
Under what circumstances?

37:18.955 --> 37:22.320
He's the cousin of this girl
that I used to go out with.

37:22.322 --> 37:25.623
- Yeah? So what happened?
- Told me to stay away from her.

37:27.654 --> 37:28.888
Pay stub?

37:32.688 --> 37:35.055
Um...

37:35.655 --> 37:37.688
"Staten Island Empires."
What is this?

37:38.255 --> 37:40.385
- It's a baseball team.
- No, no, no.

37:40.387 --> 37:42.052
No, what happened
to the fish market?

37:42.054 --> 37:42.918
I quit.

37:42.920 --> 37:44.486
No. Without telling me?

37:44.488 --> 37:46.285
No. That is not how this works.

37:46.287 --> 37:47.886
Fine, then write me up
for a violation.

37:47.888 --> 37:49.752
- All right.
- But I'm not going back there

37:49.754 --> 37:52.022
another day
to pretend like I belong.

37:52.887 --> 37:54.288
You said it yourself.

37:54.820 --> 37:57.155
I'm not qualified to do anything
but be a ballplayer.

37:58.054 --> 38:00.854
And here, somebody offers me
a job on a team.

38:02.055 --> 38:03.688
This is all up to you.

38:05.988 --> 38:08.486
All right, all right.
Just give me the pay stub.

38:08.488 --> 38:09.754
Give it to me.

38:14.888 --> 38:19.053
Don't you even think of leaving
the state without my prior consent.

38:19.055 --> 38:22.985
I want two weeks' written notice or I'll have
your ass back on a bus so fast to Sing Sing.

38:22.987 --> 38:25.119
You understand me?
And when the season is over,

38:25.121 --> 38:26.822
I want you getting
a regular gig.

38:27.521 --> 38:29.519
Now, you may think
I'm going easy on you.

38:29.521 --> 38:32.422
But I'm giving you just
enough rope to hang yourself.

38:33.222 --> 38:34.255
Stano.

38:35.555 --> 38:37.256
- Got it?
- Thank you.

38:39.455 --> 38:40.755
Do your thing.

38:44.788 --> 38:46.719
Whoo!

38:46.721 --> 38:49.519
Can do this all day, people!

38:50.921 --> 38:52.922
Certainly doesn't lack
confidence.

38:53.421 --> 38:55.252
Yeah. Don't be fooled.

38:55.254 --> 38:58.754
He's 40% confidence
and 60% scared shitless.

38:59.555 --> 39:03.320
- Hoo!
- Of what?

39:03.322 --> 39:05.385
Let's do it!
<i>Uno mas,</i> Coach!

39:05.387 --> 39:08.018
He's one of the best
utility guys I've seen in years.

39:08.020 --> 39:10.952
- He's got the stuff.
- Up the middle!

39:10.954 --> 39:12.618
Any club in the bigs
would want him.

39:12.620 --> 39:15.053
But if he doesn't start out
strong, he gets freaked out.

39:15.055 --> 39:18.721
The pitchers see it, then they
start working him into the ground.

39:19.787 --> 39:21.255
It's 'cause they're reading him.

39:29.155 --> 39:31.022
Whoo!

39:32.387 --> 39:34.718
Ain't no substitute
for youth, baby!

39:34.720 --> 39:36.585
The past, <i>finito!</i>

39:36.587 --> 39:38.918
The future, bang, right here!

39:38.920 --> 39:41.789
Right here! Oh, man.

39:42.088 --> 39:44.118
Hey, show some respect.

39:44.120 --> 39:47.320
Thought you said you had something
to learn from the older guys.

39:47.322 --> 39:48.655
Excuse me?

39:48.921 --> 39:51.652
Does "excuse me" mean
you didn't hear what I said?

39:51.654 --> 39:54.752
Or does it mean you're gonna start
some trouble if I don't back off?

39:54.754 --> 39:56.752
It means mind your business,

39:56.754 --> 39:59.353
and do whatever it is you're
supposed to be doing around here.

39:59.355 --> 40:01.489
Which nobody even knows
what that is.

40:02.887 --> 40:04.355
<i>Ya entiendo.</i>

40:06.921 --> 40:09.252
Yeah. That's right.

40:09.254 --> 40:12.119
All right. We're gonna do a sim game.
Mitchell, get on the mound.

40:12.121 --> 40:14.155
Manny, get back up at the plate.

40:16.855 --> 40:18.253
Let's go! Sim game!

40:18.255 --> 40:20.521
Nakahara, go easy on your knee.

40:23.788 --> 40:25.456
Hit this, golden boy.

40:28.720 --> 40:31.356
You better not be putting shit
on that ball, Mitchell!

40:37.221 --> 40:39.551
Hey! I find out
you usin' Vaseline,

40:39.553 --> 40:42.055
I'm gonna use it
to shove this bat up your ass!

40:50.255 --> 40:52.423
Oops. Super-Crip strikes out.

40:52.955 --> 40:54.585
Try shoving a bat
up your own ass.

40:54.587 --> 40:56.220
Might clear the booze
outta your head.

40:56.222 --> 40:57.852
There you go
with that shit, man.

40:57.854 --> 41:00.619
Whoa, whoa!

41:00.621 --> 41:01.654
Hey, hey, hey!

41:01.955 --> 41:03.922
Hey, get your fucking hands
off me, con!

41:04.554 --> 41:07.385
That's right, I looked you up!
You think you bad 'cause you was in jail?

41:07.387 --> 41:09.586
I bring some of my boys down,
we do a number on your ass!

41:09.588 --> 41:11.686
Hey, man, I'm here to work.
Just like you're supposed to be.

41:11.688 --> 41:14.918
I don't have to listen
to no sorry-ass never-was, okay?

41:14.920 --> 41:16.989
You got nothin' to teach me,
so step off!

41:22.355 --> 41:24.089
- Pick up the bat.
- Fuck you!

41:33.154 --> 41:34.985
Tell me what you're lookin' at
when you're standing here.

41:34.987 --> 41:37.320
- The ball?
- No. Why you looking at that?

41:37.322 --> 41:40.651
I'm not sure if you're aware, but that's
what the fuck you're supposed to hit.

41:40.653 --> 41:43.186
Yes, you look at the ball,
but he hasn't thrown it yet.

41:43.188 --> 41:46.119
So, what are we supposed
to look at then? His ass?

41:46.121 --> 41:48.385
Yes. You look at his ass.

41:48.387 --> 41:50.685
His body, his eyes, everything!

41:50.687 --> 41:52.121
Get on the mound.

41:53.020 --> 41:54.389
Get on the mound!

41:57.553 --> 41:59.486
You give him a signal.
Anything you want.

41:59.488 --> 42:01.955
You throw him
whatever he signals you.

42:10.322 --> 42:11.488
Sinker.

42:15.787 --> 42:17.188
Do it again. Again!

42:27.855 --> 42:29.256
Curve.

42:30.754 --> 42:32.122
One more.

42:38.120 --> 42:41.418
- Fastball.
- How'd you know that?

42:41.420 --> 42:44.085
'Cause he's giving it away
and he doesn't even know it.

42:44.087 --> 42:45.454
You read them.

42:45.820 --> 42:47.587
You don't let them read you.

42:54.155 --> 42:55.522
Let's go. You're up.

42:59.520 --> 43:01.587
Let's go, Mitchell,
come on, baby!

43:24.587 --> 43:26.853
Hey. What are you doing
out here?

43:26.855 --> 43:28.585
Waiting for my Lyft.

43:28.587 --> 43:29.952
Your Lyft?

43:29.954 --> 43:31.551
My ride is gonna be here
in one minute.

43:31.553 --> 43:33.253
What do you mean?
How can you tell?

43:33.255 --> 43:36.053
Look at this.
The little car going there.

43:36.055 --> 43:37.220
For real?

43:37.222 --> 43:39.755
Technology.

43:40.121 --> 43:41.585
Any luck with the classes?

43:41.587 --> 43:44.354
They made me take
this stupid aptitude test.

43:45.487 --> 43:47.352
You didn't even hand it in?

43:47.354 --> 43:49.655
I don't know, I guess I,
like, wasn't ready for it.

43:50.120 --> 43:51.521
Let me see.

43:57.855 --> 43:59.222
You know what?

44:00.454 --> 44:02.054
Maybe I do need to help you.

44:02.520 --> 44:04.287
Come tomorrow to my office.

44:04.754 --> 44:07.352
You know,
test taking is like an art.

44:07.354 --> 44:09.285
Maybe I can give you,
like, a couple of tips.

44:09.287 --> 44:11.085
I work during the day.

44:11.087 --> 44:12.853
How about we do dinner?
It'd be on me.

44:12.855 --> 44:15.953
No, no. You don't have
to buy me any dinner.

44:15.955 --> 44:18.718
I know I don't need to buy you dinner.
I want to.

44:18.720 --> 44:21.351
Come on, it'd make me feel like
more of a man, paying you back.

44:21.353 --> 44:23.252
For helping you with a test?

44:23.254 --> 44:24.488
Well, yeah.

44:28.055 --> 44:29.422
Come on.

44:31.821 --> 44:33.721
Okay. Friday.

44:34.688 --> 44:35.755
7:00?

44:39.554 --> 44:42.355
These mashed potatoes
aren't half bad. You want a bite?

44:43.621 --> 44:45.251
I have bad news, Sonny.

44:45.253 --> 44:46.487
What?

44:47.087 --> 44:48.788
You would have passed this.

44:49.221 --> 44:51.285
- Really?
- Yeah.

44:51.287 --> 44:52.918
But you didn't trust yourself.

44:52.920 --> 44:54.486
And the secret to test taking

44:54.488 --> 44:56.852
is listening
to your first instinct

44:56.854 --> 44:58.785
because that's usually
the right answer.

44:58.787 --> 45:02.121
I guess
I just don't trust myself yet.

45:02.955 --> 45:04.355
You'll get there.

45:08.320 --> 45:10.351
Remember comin' here
after bein' out all night?

45:10.353 --> 45:11.821
Two, three in the morning?

45:13.453 --> 45:14.919
How could I forget?

45:14.921 --> 45:17.853
We had the same routine
every Saturday.

45:19.420 --> 45:22.454
A couple of months ago
for Melissa's birthday,

45:22.888 --> 45:24.618
I took her and her friends

45:24.620 --> 45:27.454
to play mini golf
at Turtle Cove.

45:28.521 --> 45:31.086
You remember?
That was our first date.

45:31.088 --> 45:32.421
City Island.

45:33.721 --> 45:35.588
Fourteen. Jesus.

45:36.287 --> 45:38.986
Remember how big a deal it was for me
to take you out of the neighborhood?

45:38.988 --> 45:43.688
Yeah. It was like
going to another world for us.

45:44.055 --> 45:46.585
We had to get on the bus.

45:46.587 --> 45:48.952
You told me that
it was because of the mini golf,

45:48.954 --> 45:52.053
but then when we passed
the batting cages...

45:52.055 --> 45:53.985
Come on.
I had to show off to you.

45:55.088 --> 45:56.986
Yeah. You did.

45:56.988 --> 45:58.622
Well, it worked, so...

45:59.020 --> 46:00.254
It did.

46:08.155 --> 46:10.554
Can I ask...

46:12.887 --> 46:14.487
where's Melissa's father?

46:15.587 --> 46:17.121
I lost him.

46:22.487 --> 46:24.254
How long ago did he pass away?

46:24.788 --> 46:25.821
Mm-mm.

46:26.554 --> 46:29.886
I lost him.
Like in, I got rid of him.

46:29.888 --> 46:31.154
Oh.

46:34.220 --> 46:35.621
Well, congrats, I guess.

46:38.287 --> 46:39.954
Everything turned out fine.

46:40.420 --> 46:43.018
I have a great daughter,
great job.

46:43.020 --> 46:45.285
I got my teacher's license.

46:45.287 --> 46:47.285
Maybe, hopefully soon,

46:47.287 --> 46:50.622
I'm gonna be promoted to
guidance counselor at the school.

46:52.553 --> 46:54.821
All I want is
a stable life for Melissa.

47:48.720 --> 47:50.320
Hustle up!

47:53.820 --> 47:55.619
Is that Roger Peterson?

47:55.621 --> 47:57.184
What, he's down here
rehabbin' too?

47:57.186 --> 47:58.587
Yep that's the Assassin.

47:58.987 --> 48:02.521
Lost all control of the ball
and himself.

48:03.086 --> 48:05.752
So I guess we got
two legends then, huh?

48:05.754 --> 48:08.388
One's a mute,
the other's a prick.

48:10.354 --> 48:12.151
You next, superstar?

48:12.153 --> 48:14.319
Hey, don't blink.

48:14.321 --> 48:15.918
You might miss my swing.

48:15.920 --> 48:18.118
Gotta watch his two!
Watch his two!

48:18.120 --> 48:20.320
Come on!
Let's see what you got!

48:20.554 --> 48:24.718
Don't be afraid, Manny! He's tryin' to get in
your head 'cause he doesn't have anything.

48:24.720 --> 48:25.555
Hey!

48:26.787 --> 48:28.889
Don't tell me what to do, okay?
I'm not scared of nobody!

48:34.488 --> 48:35.755
<i>¡Vamos!</i>

48:42.286 --> 48:46.251
Just relax. All he's got left is a
little heat. That's why he's down here.

48:46.253 --> 48:48.986
Hey, shit lips!
Pipe the fuck down!

48:48.988 --> 48:51.985
No one's here to see you!
Someone might get hurt.

48:51.987 --> 48:55.755
Not before I send you back to
marry you cousin, fucking redneck!

48:57.987 --> 48:59.488
Put it out there!

49:07.554 --> 49:08.886
Yo! What, are you crazy?

49:08.888 --> 49:11.017
You okay?

49:11.019 --> 49:13.251
Get him up. Come on! Get him up!
Five-million-dollar deal!

49:17.120 --> 49:19.088
Get in there! Get inside!

49:21.421 --> 49:22.751
He ain't worth it!

49:22.753 --> 49:24.751
The fuck was that,
ass clown?

49:24.753 --> 49:26.651
Talking to me?
I'm not worth shit?

49:26.653 --> 49:28.118
What about you?

49:28.120 --> 49:29.452
You're a fucking nobody.

49:29.454 --> 49:30.819
I got seven years in the show.

49:30.821 --> 49:33.184
What'd you get,
20 years upstate?

49:33.186 --> 49:34.421
Fucking convict!

49:39.187 --> 49:40.422
Sonny!

49:41.754 --> 49:43.455
Let's see what you got, hotshot.

49:55.387 --> 49:57.185
Need some WD-40 with that swing?

49:57.187 --> 49:58.652
Let's go. Give me the heat!

49:58.654 --> 50:00.218
That's all you got anyway.

50:00.220 --> 50:02.554
Let's go, win this, baby!
Come on now!

50:07.953 --> 50:09.822
Whoa! Nice, Stano!

50:15.387 --> 50:17.053
Hey, guys, Cashman's here.

50:19.488 --> 50:20.889
And Bernie.

50:21.221 --> 50:22.918
Let's go, Peterson!
Come on, baby, let's go!

50:22.920 --> 50:25.121
Let's go, baby!
Win this battle. Come on now!

50:27.521 --> 50:29.054
Nice, Sonny!

50:34.587 --> 50:36.421
Crushing it, Stano!

50:37.954 --> 50:39.522
Shallow right.

50:44.421 --> 50:46.821
Nobody's throwing 95 in prison.

50:47.653 --> 50:48.954
That's for sure.

50:51.653 --> 50:52.987
Third base line.

51:27.454 --> 51:30.252
Who would have thought they ever
would have torn down the old stadium?

51:30.254 --> 51:32.418
I hear the new one
over there is amazing.

51:32.420 --> 51:34.519
Oh, no, this is the one.

51:34.521 --> 51:36.052
This is hallowed ground.

51:36.054 --> 51:37.688
Think of all the greats
that played here.

51:38.220 --> 51:41.654
Right over there is where Lou Gehrig
made his "luckiest man alive" speech.

51:42.720 --> 51:45.721
Right over there is where Mickey
Mantle played center field.

51:46.788 --> 51:48.921
Think of all
the World Series games.

51:50.386 --> 51:52.920
Tino hit that grand slam in '98.

51:53.987 --> 51:56.088
And he swept the Braves in '99.

51:57.620 --> 51:59.020
It was the year I went in.

52:01.087 --> 52:02.887
I would have been on that team.

52:04.087 --> 52:05.121
Can you imagine?

52:07.588 --> 52:09.354
It would have been me up at bat.

52:10.154 --> 52:12.688
You would have been watching me,
cheering me on right over there.

52:13.553 --> 52:16.285
The Bleacher Creatures
screaming everybody's name.

52:16.287 --> 52:19.688
Paul O'Neill. Bernie Williams.

52:21.087 --> 52:22.155
Me.

52:26.721 --> 52:28.588
Why didn't I just walk away?

52:30.420 --> 52:33.187
Why did I let that stupid guy
in the street bother me?

52:34.320 --> 52:36.654
Sonny, why are we here?

52:37.386 --> 52:38.820
'Cause every day I was away,

52:39.154 --> 52:41.953
all I'd do is try
not to think about this place.

52:43.119 --> 52:45.755
'Cause more than anything,
it made me think about you.

52:47.086 --> 52:49.254
This is where I took you
on our last date.

52:50.752 --> 52:52.554
We were sittin'
in seats right here.

52:53.087 --> 52:54.288
I remember.

52:55.254 --> 52:58.622
It's the last time I can ever
remember being truly happy.

53:00.220 --> 53:01.687
Being here with you.

53:06.221 --> 53:09.088
I'm getting cold.
Let's go back to the car, huh?

53:11.120 --> 53:12.155
Okay.

53:26.654 --> 53:28.188
This was really nice.

53:29.553 --> 53:31.555
- I really want...
- Yeah, me too.

53:33.353 --> 53:34.788
You too what?

53:36.120 --> 53:38.118
I don't know.
What were you gonna say?

53:39.621 --> 53:40.887
Nothing.

53:42.520 --> 53:44.687
But do you remember...

53:45.588 --> 53:47.753
what you told me
on our first date?

53:51.321 --> 53:53.688
Hands on hands.

53:54.354 --> 53:55.655
That it meant...

53:57.286 --> 53:58.587
forever.

53:59.787 --> 54:02.422
I just made that up
'cause I was scared to kiss you.

54:04.787 --> 54:06.188
But I meant it.

54:23.320 --> 54:25.354
You know
I didn't ask you out just...

54:27.520 --> 54:29.020
I know.

54:31.720 --> 54:33.155
Doesn't matter.

55:04.154 --> 55:05.254
Angela.

55:05.652 --> 55:08.154
Yes, you can call me, Sonny.

55:32.686 --> 55:34.120
Why are we meeting here?

55:35.186 --> 55:37.188
I had some business
to take care of.

55:37.886 --> 55:42.087
Thought you might like to come out to
good old Staten Island, see the old field.

55:42.787 --> 55:45.684
Looks the same.
Maybe a little nicer.

55:45.686 --> 55:49.418
Yeah, paint job,
new scoreboard.

55:49.420 --> 55:50.753
That's about it.

55:52.521 --> 55:53.654
So...

55:54.086 --> 55:55.887
they got rid of Peterson.

55:56.619 --> 55:58.518
Wasn't worth the liability.

55:58.520 --> 55:59.817
Sorry to hear that.

55:59.819 --> 56:01.352
No, you're not.

56:01.354 --> 56:03.885
In fact, I think
you had something to do with it.

56:03.887 --> 56:05.221
What does that mean?

56:06.253 --> 56:10.017
You had some pretty impressive
hitting against him the other day.

56:10.019 --> 56:13.720
And despite all other problems
Peterson may have...

56:14.753 --> 56:16.121
he still had the heat.

56:16.753 --> 56:19.650
He was throwin' hard and fast,
and you were in the zone.

56:19.652 --> 56:21.684
Even Cashman noticed it.

56:21.686 --> 56:22.953
Got lucky, I guess.

56:23.254 --> 56:25.785
Nah. Now that's where
I'm gonna call bullshit on you.

56:25.787 --> 56:29.554
You know as well as I do that you
always had it and you never lost it.

56:30.652 --> 56:33.084
You were showing somebody
something the other day.

56:33.086 --> 56:35.851
Now, maybe it was me, Manny,

56:35.853 --> 56:37.654
who knows,
could even have been God.

56:38.087 --> 56:41.455
But you were the same Stano
I first saw play 20 years ago.

56:44.353 --> 56:47.485
What would you say
if I got you a spot on the team?

56:47.487 --> 56:48.951
I'd say you were crazy.

56:48.953 --> 56:51.354
I think
you still got the goods.

56:52.153 --> 56:54.320
Nah, I played
my last baseball game.

56:54.920 --> 56:57.184
June 24th, 1999.

56:57.186 --> 56:59.154
It was ten days
into my sentence.

57:00.854 --> 57:02.117
Come on, it'd be a joke.

57:02.119 --> 57:03.852
You hit that way
during the season,

57:03.854 --> 57:06.452
the way you were hitting the other
day, it would be no joke.

57:06.454 --> 57:08.818
Who knows? You might even
get invited to winter ball.

57:08.820 --> 57:11.618
No.

57:11.620 --> 57:13.951
- Yeah. And why not?
- 'Cause it's a big maybe.

57:13.953 --> 57:17.352
And I'm 38 years old and I
can't deal with maybes anymore.

57:17.354 --> 57:20.018
Goddamn it, I'm offering you
a second shot here!

57:20.020 --> 57:21.554
I never asked you
for a second shot.

57:21.753 --> 57:25.617
Oh, yeah? Then why are you here?
Huh? I know why.

57:25.619 --> 57:28.017
Okay, because you couldn't
stop yourself, okay?

57:28.019 --> 57:29.651
You got so much talent
inside yourself

57:29.653 --> 57:31.685
you couldn't stop using it
even if you tried.

57:31.687 --> 57:35.151
Sometimes, you gotta give in
to it instead of fighting it.

57:35.153 --> 57:37.252
You had the stuff
to be one of the greats.

57:37.254 --> 57:40.117
Yeah, but I'm not.
And it ain't gonna happen.

57:40.119 --> 57:41.853
You know
what Honus Wagner said?

57:42.353 --> 57:46.118
"There ain't nothing to being a
ballplayer if you're a ballplayer."

57:46.120 --> 57:49.288
And you, Stano,
are a ballplayer.

58:01.954 --> 58:03.121
Hello?

58:03.552 --> 58:06.084
- <i>Sonny Stano?</i>
- Yeah, this is him.

58:06.086 --> 58:08.584
<i>Yeah, this is Charles Denny
from</i> The New York Post.

58:08.586 --> 58:09.754
What's this about?

58:11.121 --> 58:13.220
<i>We heard you were added to the
roster of the Staten Island Empires.</i>

58:13.786 --> 58:15.751
<i>You're an incredible
comeback story, Sonny.</i>

58:15.753 --> 58:17.585
<i>Now, seriously,
it's inspirational,</i>

58:17.587 --> 58:19.454
<i>and I think it would make
a great article.</i>

58:20.220 --> 58:22.920
<i>Would you mind if I just
asked you a few questions?</i>

58:23.386 --> 58:24.420
Yeah, okay.

58:25.821 --> 58:28.384
<i>Great. My first question is, how do
you think the fans are gonna respond</i>

58:28.386 --> 58:30.454
<i>to an ex-con
playing on their field?</i>

58:34.221 --> 58:36.620
I don't know. I mean, uh...

58:38.221 --> 58:42.188
Well, I think baseball fans
are really special.

58:43.020 --> 58:44.554
I just hope that...

58:46.354 --> 58:49.017
that they have
a sense of forgiveness.

58:49.019 --> 58:50.586
<i>Well, how about your teammates?</i>

58:51.086 --> 58:53.287
I can't speak for them, but I...

58:54.819 --> 58:57.254
I hope they just see me
as another player.

58:58.186 --> 59:00.418
You know, I... I'm
really no different from them

59:00.420 --> 59:03.288
and... and they're
no different from me.

59:04.887 --> 59:06.650
<i>This is gonna sound
a little crazy, but...</i>

59:06.652 --> 59:08.651
<i>you think you could
make the majors again,</i>

59:08.653 --> 59:10.421
<i>like you did in '99?</i>

59:18.719 --> 59:20.021
Yeah.

59:21.586 --> 59:23.383
Yeah, I think I can.

59:23.385 --> 59:24.453
I...

59:25.819 --> 59:27.188
I made it once.

59:28.420 --> 59:30.221
I think I can make it again.

59:47.986 --> 59:50.350
We got a lot of different food
here we're gonna get,

59:50.352 --> 59:52.184
but we gotta
stretch it out first!

59:52.186 --> 59:55.185
- Hut! Hut! Hut!
- Three! Four! Five!

59:55.187 --> 59:57.586
- Hut! Hut! Hut!
- Six! Seven! Eight!

59:58.220 --> 01:00:00.187
Little more, little more!

01:00:00.819 --> 01:00:03.251
- One, two, three!
- Empires!

01:00:03.253 --> 01:00:05.117
Let's go!

01:00:05.119 --> 01:00:06.987
Let's go! Ready? Let's go!

01:00:12.253 --> 01:00:14.154
Stano, you got a partner?

01:00:15.920 --> 01:00:17.288
Let's go.

01:00:34.186 --> 01:00:35.885
Hey, Billy. How you doing?

01:00:35.887 --> 01:00:37.354
She ain't here.

01:00:37.887 --> 01:00:40.318
Um... You know
when she'll be back?

01:00:40.320 --> 01:00:42.287
No. I don't know
when she's coming back.

01:00:44.887 --> 01:00:47.155
Well, can you tell her
I dropped by, then?

01:00:57.620 --> 01:01:00.151
- <i>What're you doin' here?</i>
- <i>What do you mean?</i>

01:01:00.153 --> 01:01:01.718
You know what I mean.

01:01:01.720 --> 01:01:04.219
Angela just got out
of a fucked-up relationship,

01:01:04.221 --> 01:01:06.185
only to walk into another one?

01:01:06.187 --> 01:01:07.650
She don't need that.

01:01:07.652 --> 01:01:10.283
And Melissa,
she can't be around you, man.

01:01:10.285 --> 01:01:13.118
<i>Not around guys like you
with your kind of history.</i>

01:01:13.120 --> 01:01:16.051
<i>Can you imagine some fuckhead
from the joint you had a beef with</i>

01:01:16.053 --> 01:01:17.718
comes out looking for blood?

01:01:17.720 --> 01:01:19.718
- Now you know what I mean?
- Billy, come on, man.

01:01:19.720 --> 01:01:23.283
No, no, no. Listen, listen.
If you really care about my cousin,

01:01:23.285 --> 01:01:24.887
you think about her, okay?

01:01:25.420 --> 01:01:29.351
She is just straightening out her life
right now for her and her daughter.

01:01:29.353 --> 01:01:32.487
I'm gonna ask you one last time
as nice as I can.

01:01:33.120 --> 01:01:37.121
Please stay away from Angela.
Capisce?

01:03:41.386 --> 01:03:43.418
<i>Sonny, hi. Um, it's me.</i>

01:03:43.420 --> 01:03:47.085
<i>I tried you
a couple of times, but... um...</i>

01:03:47.087 --> 01:03:49.417
<i>I heard about your good news.</i>

01:03:49.419 --> 01:03:53.018
<i>So I wanted to say, um,
I'm so happy that you're playing again.</i>

01:03:53.020 --> 01:03:57.250
<i>Call me sometime.
If you have the time, of course.</i>

01:03:57.252 --> 01:03:58.621
<i>Okay, bye.</i>

01:05:11.153 --> 01:05:12.387
It's a fastball.

01:05:16.919 --> 01:05:19.686
- Let's go!
- Come on, Manny, stay icy!

01:05:20.886 --> 01:05:22.687
Don't swing! Just look at it!

01:05:31.919 --> 01:05:33.286
Sinker.

01:05:35.920 --> 01:05:37.554
God damnit, God!

01:05:43.452 --> 01:05:45.350
Stano, grab a bat. Come on!

01:05:45.352 --> 01:05:48.386
We didn't sign you to sit there
with that ugly puss. Let's go.

01:05:54.385 --> 01:05:58.685
<i>Stepping in for
Ojeda is number 13, Sonny Stano.</i>

01:05:58.687 --> 01:06:01.888
Hey! It's the jailbird!

01:06:05.285 --> 01:06:07.052
Look for your pitch, kid.

01:06:07.720 --> 01:06:09.817
- Come on, Stano.
- Let's go, convict!

01:06:09.819 --> 01:06:11.754
- Come on, Stano!
- Play!

01:06:16.419 --> 01:06:18.653
All right, settle down, Sonny,
settle down.

01:06:21.519 --> 01:06:22.817
Look for your pitch, kid!

01:06:22.819 --> 01:06:24.952
Get ready.
Come on, let's go.

01:06:31.919 --> 01:06:33.952
That's all right, Stano.

01:06:34.753 --> 01:06:36.484
Come on, baby.

01:06:36.486 --> 01:06:37.818
Let's go, kid, come on.

01:06:37.820 --> 01:06:39.521
Get a good pitch!

01:06:44.219 --> 01:06:45.787
Strike!

01:06:47.053 --> 01:06:49.785
- That's bullshit.
- You say something, Stano?

01:06:49.787 --> 01:06:52.184
- No, I didn't say anything.
- No, I heard you say something.

01:06:52.186 --> 01:06:54.551
You did. You know what?
If you think I'm gonna go easy on you

01:06:54.553 --> 01:06:56.350
and your jailbird ass,
it ain't happening.

01:06:56.352 --> 01:06:58.750
You know what? You're done
for today. Get out of here.

01:06:58.752 --> 01:07:01.251
- What are you talking about?
- You're done! Get out of here.

01:07:01.253 --> 01:07:03.852
- You want to add extra games?
- The pitch was low!

01:07:03.854 --> 01:07:05.484
Take a walk, you're done.

01:07:05.486 --> 01:07:08.119
<i>And Stano is thrown
out of this ballgame.</i>

01:07:11.219 --> 01:07:12.720
All right, guys.

01:07:13.420 --> 01:07:14.916
A five-nothing loss
isn't exactly

01:07:14.918 --> 01:07:16.852
the greatest way
to start a season,

01:07:16.854 --> 01:07:19.854
but let's not let it throw us.

01:07:20.118 --> 01:07:23.685
Remember, next Thursday
we're all heading upstate

01:07:23.687 --> 01:07:25.517
for a week of away games,

01:07:25.519 --> 01:07:27.883
so let's just
take it easy for now,

01:07:27.885 --> 01:07:29.851
get our sea legs under us.

01:07:29.853 --> 01:07:32.854
And remember,
tomorrow's another game.

01:07:41.854 --> 01:07:45.950
In my 35 fuckin' years of
being around this God damn game,

01:07:45.952 --> 01:07:49.717
I have never ever seen
such a lazy, crappy,

01:07:49.719 --> 01:07:51.617
no-good, no-balls, no-nothing,

01:07:51.619 --> 01:07:53.684
Goddamn fucking bunch of losers

01:07:53.686 --> 01:07:57.884
blow a fucking opening day game
like that in my entire Goddamn life!

01:07:57.886 --> 01:08:00.250
Get your heads
out of your asses!

01:08:00.252 --> 01:08:02.217
Or I'm gonna fuck...

01:08:02.219 --> 01:08:03.484
Fuck!

01:09:09.720 --> 01:09:11.120
Strike!

01:09:17.885 --> 01:09:19.118
Strike!

01:09:40.252 --> 01:09:42.086
All right, guys,
let's go, let's pack it up.

01:09:43.118 --> 01:09:47.951
- Fuck! Fucking stupid!
- Hey, stop that.

01:09:47.953 --> 01:09:50.716
We all saw what you did in practice.
Okay? You can still play this game.

01:09:50.719 --> 01:09:52.983
Yeah, against some half string
pitcher out of fucking rehab.

01:09:52.984 --> 01:09:55.120
No, goddamn it,
I know what I saw.

01:09:56.085 --> 01:09:58.050
If anyone was fucking stupid,
maybe it was me.

01:09:58.052 --> 01:09:59.917
Maybe I brought
you along too quick.

01:09:59.919 --> 01:10:02.454
But there's something wrong,
and unless it changes fast,

01:10:03.553 --> 01:10:06.154
they ain't gonna let me keep you on.
You understand?

01:10:10.686 --> 01:10:13.719
Hey, Sonny. Do you understand?

01:10:15.486 --> 01:10:16.853
Don't let it end this way.

01:11:25.520 --> 01:11:27.585
We're missing your best friend.

01:11:27.587 --> 01:11:29.584
- Who?
- Manny the mooch.

01:11:29.586 --> 01:11:30.919
Find him.

01:11:35.853 --> 01:11:37.187
I'm tired of this shit.

01:11:41.319 --> 01:11:42.387
Yo, Manny.

01:11:46.319 --> 01:11:47.353
Hey.

01:11:50.252 --> 01:11:52.384
Let's go.
Come on, man, get up.

01:11:52.386 --> 01:11:55.217
Shit!

01:11:58.019 --> 01:12:01.417
Hello, man. We were just,
you know, celebrating...

01:12:01.419 --> 01:12:04.317
Celebrating what? The fact that you
finally made contact with the ball?

01:12:04.319 --> 01:12:06.649
Come on, grab your shit.
Let's go. Get your shit.

01:12:06.651 --> 01:12:08.421
Okay. Okay. Okay.

01:12:18.585 --> 01:12:20.520
Hey. Oh, shit.

01:12:21.086 --> 01:12:25.052
You know, Stano, I don't do
this, you know, a lot.

01:12:27.519 --> 01:12:32.518
You don't have to, you know,
talk to Coach about...

01:12:32.520 --> 01:12:35.952
you know, any of this. This is...
this don't happen a lot, papa.

01:12:38.918 --> 01:12:40.153
Get on the bus.

01:12:42.052 --> 01:12:43.186
Now.

01:12:54.452 --> 01:12:55.720
Yo, Stano.

01:12:57.252 --> 01:12:58.387
Thanks, man.

01:13:04.685 --> 01:13:06.550
<i>...not a long lead.
He holds his ground</i>

01:13:06.552 --> 01:13:08.320
<i>and it's a base hit
to left field.</i>

01:13:08.886 --> 01:13:12.417
<i>Takes to third, he heads to
third, and he's gonna get it.</i>

01:13:12.419 --> 01:13:14.351
<i>The throw to second base,
not in time.</i>

01:13:14.353 --> 01:13:16.254
<i>Runners at second and third.</i>

01:13:25.919 --> 01:13:27.220
Thanks for meeting me.

01:13:40.119 --> 01:13:41.487
You want something?

01:13:46.952 --> 01:13:48.817
I'm sorry I haven't
called you back.

01:13:48.819 --> 01:13:52.919
I've just been doing a lot
of thinking about everything.

01:13:58.019 --> 01:13:59.319
I don't know what I'm doing.

01:14:01.585 --> 01:14:03.853
I don't know how much longer
I'm gonna be doing it.

01:14:05.686 --> 01:14:07.387
I'm pretty sure it's...

01:14:08.153 --> 01:14:09.486
It's gonna be over
pretty soon.

01:14:11.685 --> 01:14:14.353
And I don't know what's
gonna happen to me after. I...

01:14:15.519 --> 01:14:18.516
But I do know that there's
no way in hell

01:14:18.518 --> 01:14:20.819
I'm gonna be making
any money doing it.

01:14:28.419 --> 01:14:31.749
Please don't tell me that the
reason that you're hurting me again

01:14:31.751 --> 01:14:33.986
is because you don't want
to hurt me again.

01:14:35.486 --> 01:14:37.919
Because that makes no sense,
Sonny.

01:14:39.685 --> 01:14:41.219
I guess Bill was right.

01:14:42.551 --> 01:14:43.852
Billy was right.

01:14:44.652 --> 01:14:46.187
So is everybody else.

01:14:47.086 --> 01:14:48.519
What, you think I don't know?

01:14:50.186 --> 01:14:52.685
You think I don't see the way
that these people look at me?

01:14:53.153 --> 01:14:55.154
Think I don't hear
what they say about me?

01:14:56.285 --> 01:14:58.383
You know, there's people
that buy tickets to my games

01:14:58.385 --> 01:15:00.619
just so they can yell stuff
at me from the crowd.

01:15:02.518 --> 01:15:03.552
But I get it.

01:15:06.019 --> 01:15:07.254
I killed somebody.

01:15:11.719 --> 01:15:13.287
And I'm always gonna carry that.

01:15:16.751 --> 01:15:18.485
But you and Melissa
don't have to.

01:15:21.886 --> 01:15:23.253
This is my fault.

01:15:24.086 --> 01:15:25.319
'Cause I just...

01:15:28.252 --> 01:15:29.652
I had this fantasy...

01:15:31.285 --> 01:15:33.486
that I could get out
and things would just...

01:15:34.818 --> 01:15:36.552
go back to the
way that they were.

01:15:41.952 --> 01:15:43.419
We're not 19 anymore.

01:15:45.253 --> 01:15:47.220
It's never gonna
be that way for me.

01:15:50.618 --> 01:15:53.653
As much as it breaks my heart...

01:15:59.986 --> 01:16:02.186
you're better off
without me now.

01:16:05.252 --> 01:16:06.686
And I have to accept that.

01:16:08.185 --> 01:16:12.186
Don't tell me what is...
is or isn't good for me.

01:16:14.686 --> 01:16:17.650
In the past I've known
what has been bad for me,

01:16:17.652 --> 01:16:19.287
and I have handled it.

01:16:22.685 --> 01:16:26.186
If I want to stay with someone
or leave someone...

01:16:28.585 --> 01:16:30.420
it's my decision.

01:16:32.053 --> 01:16:34.483
But if you want to spend
the rest of your life

01:16:34.485 --> 01:16:38.386
sitting there feeling
sorry for yourself...

01:16:38.985 --> 01:16:40.385
go ahead.

01:16:42.985 --> 01:16:44.352
Think about it.

01:16:53.318 --> 01:16:55.219
You know where to find me.

01:17:17.852 --> 01:17:21.053
<i>Hirohito Nakahara
sets himself up to the plate.</i>

01:17:29.285 --> 01:17:32.184
Go, go, go, go, go!

01:17:32.186 --> 01:17:34.720
Slide, slide, slide!

01:17:49.252 --> 01:17:50.753
Can't move! I can't get up!

01:17:57.651 --> 01:17:59.983
<i>Let's give him
a round of applause, folks.</i>

01:18:01.818 --> 01:18:05.151
Yeah, easy... Oh, yeah.
Go for it. Yeah.

01:18:05.153 --> 01:18:06.382
Oh! That hurts.

01:18:06.384 --> 01:18:07.750
Yeah, easy, easy.

01:18:11.119 --> 01:18:13.586
Thanks, man. Thank you.

01:18:17.853 --> 01:18:21.250
I just want to stop by
and pay my respects and say...

01:18:21.252 --> 01:18:23.217
I'm sure when you're back
out there next year,

01:18:23.219 --> 01:18:24.887
you'll get 3,000.

01:18:25.119 --> 01:18:26.753
There won't be
any more next year.

01:18:28.185 --> 01:18:31.519
There's only, what,
30 guys who've hit 3,000?

01:18:32.552 --> 01:18:34.683
Pulling out now,
that would crush anybody.

01:18:34.685 --> 01:18:40.052
You know, all we have,
as a player, is your best.

01:18:41.318 --> 01:18:44.286
Play every game
like it's your last game.

01:18:45.318 --> 01:18:46.820
One day you'll be right.

01:18:50.019 --> 01:18:51.150
Thanks.

01:18:51.152 --> 01:18:52.819
Give your best in the field.

01:19:09.886 --> 01:19:11.219
Yo, Stano.

01:19:13.651 --> 01:19:14.653
Stano.

01:19:15.019 --> 01:19:17.150
I heard you the first time.
What do you want?

01:19:17.152 --> 01:19:19.353
I just wanna, uh,
say thank you for...

01:19:20.618 --> 01:19:22.887
not telling the coaches
what you saw the other day.

01:19:23.552 --> 01:19:25.653
If I did what was right,

01:19:26.152 --> 01:19:27.720
I would have told the coaches.

01:19:30.352 --> 01:19:32.951
What is that supposed
to mean, man?

01:19:32.953 --> 01:19:34.520
It means I don't care.

01:19:35.251 --> 01:19:37.317
You wanna throw
your life away, your dreams,

01:19:37.319 --> 01:19:38.553
I don't care.

01:19:40.252 --> 01:19:42.416
You got talent, man.

01:19:42.418 --> 01:19:45.349
But someday,
it's gonna dry up.

01:19:45.351 --> 01:19:47.517
And if you don't
protect it now,

01:19:47.519 --> 01:19:49.787
life's just gonna
make an example out of you.

01:19:50.284 --> 01:19:51.519
Trust me.

01:20:02.119 --> 01:20:04.951
I know you love baseball, man.
But what the fuck is this shit?

01:20:07.053 --> 01:20:08.983
I don't know. They built
the Minor League stadium

01:20:08.985 --> 01:20:11.149
with a fucking
miniature golf course.

01:20:12.686 --> 01:20:14.217
I mean,
I know baseball's boring,

01:20:14.219 --> 01:20:15.653
but Jesus Christ...

01:20:18.486 --> 01:20:20.186
Let me try that thing, man.

01:20:32.451 --> 01:20:35.884
<i>Coño,</i> this...
this is heavy.

01:20:35.886 --> 01:20:39.186
- Put your hips into it.
- My hips, eh?

01:20:44.252 --> 01:20:46.316
You can do better
than that.

01:20:48.351 --> 01:20:49.819
Come on, man. Swing it.

01:20:50.219 --> 01:20:52.586
Ah.

01:21:52.385 --> 01:21:53.987
- Mom?
- Hm?

01:22:08.886 --> 01:22:11.115
I think
they're baseball tickets.

01:22:11.117 --> 01:22:12.719
Can we go, please?

01:23:02.151 --> 01:23:03.787
Strike!

01:23:06.118 --> 01:23:07.453
Pick your feet up!

01:23:19.384 --> 01:23:20.886
Run, Goddamn it!

01:23:22.117 --> 01:23:23.786
Look, look!

01:23:26.352 --> 01:23:28.082
Down! Down!

01:23:29.819 --> 01:23:31.052
Safe!

01:23:32.218 --> 01:23:33.317
Yeah!

01:23:44.219 --> 01:23:46.684
- Hey, here you go, Sonny.
- Thanks, Ronnie.

01:23:46.686 --> 01:23:48.283
- Throw it in the tip jar.
- Bye.

01:23:48.285 --> 01:23:50.952
- That was really stupid.
- Oh! Don't say that.

01:23:52.786 --> 01:23:55.019
You remember that song?

01:23:55.852 --> 01:23:57.417
Did you have fun tonight?

01:23:57.419 --> 01:23:59.883
Yeah, it was great.
Kind of long, though.

01:23:59.885 --> 01:24:03.716
It was really cool when you slid
on the ground. Did that hurt?

01:24:03.718 --> 01:24:05.585
Not if you
practice doing it right.

01:24:06.419 --> 01:24:07.783
Can you teach me how
to do it sometime?

01:24:07.785 --> 01:24:09.383
- Sure.
- No. No, no, no.

01:24:09.385 --> 01:24:10.749
She has to go home.

01:24:10.751 --> 01:24:12.552
It's past her bedtime.

01:24:13.586 --> 01:24:15.150
Yo, asshole!

01:24:15.152 --> 01:24:17.317
I'll meet you at the car.
Go ahead. No, no, no.

01:24:17.319 --> 01:24:19.616
Congratulations! I hear
you're back in the game,

01:24:19.618 --> 01:24:21.350
- playin' for the minors, right?
- Yeah, man.

01:24:21.352 --> 01:24:23.250
Nice how things are fallin'
back into place for you.

01:24:23.252 --> 01:24:25.417
Got your girl back, I see.
Playing ball again.

01:24:25.419 --> 01:24:27.783
And where's my brother?
I'll tell you where he is!

01:24:27.785 --> 01:24:29.784
He's still in the fucking
ground, that's where!

01:24:29.786 --> 01:24:32.816
And you're walking the streets,
all fucking big man,

01:24:32.818 --> 01:24:34.649
happy, healthy, whatever!

01:24:34.651 --> 01:24:36.950
Pretending that you're not
what you really are.

01:24:36.952 --> 01:24:39.916
A scumbag, killer,
con piece of shit!

01:24:39.918 --> 01:24:43.949
Hey, man, don't do this here.
Not here, not now.

01:24:47.486 --> 01:24:50.619
Okay. Okay, big man.

01:24:52.318 --> 01:24:54.118
Catch you another
time then, I guess.

01:25:15.151 --> 01:25:16.649
- Mom?
- Hmm?

01:25:16.651 --> 01:25:18.951
Why was Sonny in jail
for 18 years?

01:25:20.519 --> 01:25:21.852
Yeah...

01:25:22.486 --> 01:25:25.216
I guess Sonny was out one night

01:25:25.218 --> 01:25:30.185
with some guys,
and they got into a fight.

01:25:30.685 --> 01:25:33.617
There was an accident
and someone died.

01:25:33.619 --> 01:25:35.520
Did Sonny mean to do it?

01:25:35.817 --> 01:25:37.851
No, baby, of course not.

01:25:39.219 --> 01:25:42.716
But sometimes, when you hang
with the wrong people,

01:25:42.718 --> 01:25:44.785
in the wrong places...

01:25:46.285 --> 01:25:47.852
people make mistakes.

01:25:48.085 --> 01:25:50.553
You said
everyone makes mistakes.

01:25:51.552 --> 01:25:53.286
Yeah. We all do.

01:25:53.951 --> 01:25:56.485
And some can be very bad.

01:25:56.885 --> 01:25:59.286
That's why you need
to be very careful.

01:26:01.418 --> 01:26:05.051
You know what the most important
part of making a mistake is?

01:26:06.219 --> 01:26:07.919
What you learn after...

01:26:08.184 --> 01:26:09.686
and you do after.

01:26:12.318 --> 01:26:13.886
Now go sleepies!

01:26:14.651 --> 01:26:16.620
We have school tomorrow.

01:26:16.918 --> 01:26:22.250
Well, congratulation, Stano. Your piss
is cleaner than a shit-hand sanitizer.

01:26:23.751 --> 01:26:25.986
Any contact with an officer
of the law?

01:26:26.486 --> 01:26:27.786
Yes.

01:26:28.719 --> 01:26:30.216
Under what circumstances?

01:26:30.218 --> 01:26:32.552
I'm not gonna leave
his cousin alone.

01:26:35.185 --> 01:26:39.216
Uh... Do you think
your girlfriend's cousin,

01:26:39.218 --> 01:26:41.519
the cop, enjoys
having you around, Stano?

01:26:42.018 --> 01:26:45.918
Look, it... might seem like
I'm asking for trouble, but...

01:26:48.851 --> 01:26:52.818
Look, you... you and I are gonna
have to agree to disagree on this.

01:26:56.384 --> 01:27:02.352
So... do you have a plan
for when you get cut?

01:27:02.885 --> 01:27:05.182
- Maybe I'll be like Lou Gehrig.
- Excuse me?

01:27:05.184 --> 01:27:07.149
When he got too sick to play,

01:27:07.151 --> 01:27:10.052
he found work in another
field...

01:27:10.585 --> 01:27:11.685
as a parole officer.

01:27:12.118 --> 01:27:14.283
He said it was the most
satisfying work of his life,

01:27:14.285 --> 01:27:16.918
helping people get second
chances at their lives.

01:27:18.652 --> 01:27:21.653
Okay. We're done here.

01:27:24.717 --> 01:27:26.217
You should come see
me play sometime.

01:27:26.219 --> 01:27:28.316
You're supposed to come
visit me at work, right?

01:27:28.318 --> 01:27:31.217
Yeah, no thanks.
I wanna fall asleep, I'll talk to my wife.

01:27:34.519 --> 01:27:36.852
Hey, forgetting something?

01:27:37.619 --> 01:27:38.851
Nice catch.

01:27:48.385 --> 01:27:49.620
Come on.

01:28:09.485 --> 01:28:10.951
Sinker.

01:28:16.618 --> 01:28:17.918
Fastball.

01:28:24.418 --> 01:28:26.216
Changeup.

01:30:34.684 --> 01:30:36.785
Okay, you ready?

01:30:38.219 --> 01:30:41.250
Cashman's sending scouts
to see you on Friday night.

01:30:41.252 --> 01:30:42.915
You gotta be shitting me.

01:30:42.917 --> 01:30:44.616
No, I'm not shitting you.
What do you think,

01:30:44.618 --> 01:30:47.049
I drive all the way up to the
Bronx for some bullshit prank

01:30:47.051 --> 01:30:48.385
and a slice of pizza?

01:30:48.884 --> 01:30:51.082
You're hitting .407, Sonny.

01:30:51.084 --> 01:30:53.683
Sixteen home runs, 23 ribbies.

01:30:53.685 --> 01:30:55.849
It's one of the hottest months
we've ever seen

01:30:55.851 --> 01:30:58.648
- anybody have in the minors.
- I don't know what to say.

01:30:58.650 --> 01:31:01.318
Well, how about, that's
great fucking news, Coach.

01:31:03.151 --> 01:31:05.316
Why don't they
want somebody younger?

01:31:05.318 --> 01:31:09.583
Somebody more proven? Somebody that's
played a couple years in the minors?

01:31:09.585 --> 01:31:11.119
You're a monster hitter.

01:31:11.551 --> 01:31:14.852
Cashman sees what you're capable of.
So do I.

01:31:18.550 --> 01:31:21.885
Don't act like my history
isn't a huge part of this.

01:31:22.617 --> 01:31:26.383
My past would outweigh anything
having to do with baseball,

01:31:26.385 --> 01:31:27.286
and you know it.

01:31:28.718 --> 01:31:31.585
You know how many people out there
don't wanna see me in a Yankee uniform?

01:31:32.550 --> 01:31:35.349
It's one thing blocking out
100 people at Staten Island.

01:31:35.351 --> 01:31:38.082
It's whole other thing
on national television

01:31:38.084 --> 01:31:39.518
with millions of people
watching.

01:31:44.451 --> 01:31:47.819
Look, after everything
you've been through, Sonny,

01:31:48.118 --> 01:31:50.051
you're entitled
to whatever you want.

01:31:51.750 --> 01:31:53.618
But don't run away
from your past.

01:31:54.152 --> 01:31:55.751
Your past is a part of you.

01:31:56.551 --> 01:31:59.350
I mean, look at everything you've
accomplished since you've been here.

01:31:59.352 --> 01:32:03.618
Your past inspires people. I mean, look
what you did for that little prick, Manny.

01:32:04.184 --> 01:32:07.585
I mean, nobody could get through to
him, but you got through to him.

01:32:08.285 --> 01:32:10.018
You made him a ballplayer.

01:32:10.618 --> 01:32:13.684
I was right.
Things happen for a reason.

01:32:14.052 --> 01:32:16.150
Don't tell me that
somewhere deep down inside

01:32:16.152 --> 01:32:18.152
you didn't think
this could happen.

01:32:20.984 --> 01:32:22.285
I didn't.

01:32:24.518 --> 01:32:27.685
Just didn't wanna work at
that stupid fish store anymore.

01:32:28.351 --> 01:32:31.885
I don't blame you.

01:32:33.717 --> 01:32:37.515
The fish store.
Holy shit.

01:32:37.517 --> 01:32:39.382
- It was a job.
- Yeah.

01:32:39.384 --> 01:32:40.916
- It was.
- Oh, it was a great job.

01:32:40.918 --> 01:32:42.250
Yeah, it's an honorable
profession.

01:32:42.252 --> 01:32:43.682
- Oh, yes, very honorable.
- Yeah.

01:32:43.684 --> 01:32:45.618
That's right,
you and Jesus Christ.

01:32:47.984 --> 01:32:50.082
Stop being so
nervous about tomorrow.

01:32:50.084 --> 01:32:52.219
- You're gonna be great.
- I know.

01:32:52.917 --> 01:32:54.318
It's like the test.

01:32:54.985 --> 01:32:56.716
Trust your instinct.

01:32:56.718 --> 01:32:58.384
Believe in yourself. That's it.

01:33:00.818 --> 01:33:02.919
I'm not really nervous
about tomorrow.

01:33:04.252 --> 01:33:07.182
There were years that went by,
I thought I'd never be free again,

01:33:07.184 --> 01:33:08.519
let alone play ball.

01:33:09.252 --> 01:33:10.886
I took somebody's life,

01:33:11.184 --> 01:33:13.415
and here I am about to
take a spot in the majors

01:33:13.417 --> 01:33:15.850
from somebody else
who actually deserves it.

01:33:15.852 --> 01:33:19.649
You paid your price.
Everybody deserves a second chance.

01:33:19.651 --> 01:33:23.719
You're a good person, Sonny.
Maybe that's God's way of telling you that.

01:33:24.184 --> 01:33:27.218
Let's just say
the best-case scenario happens,

01:33:28.051 --> 01:33:29.584
and they call me up.

01:33:30.351 --> 01:33:32.419
And then I'm good enough
for them to keep on.

01:33:33.451 --> 01:33:35.652
How many years could
I possibly have left?

01:33:36.585 --> 01:33:38.384
One? Two?

01:33:39.285 --> 01:33:40.915
I don't know
anything about baseball,

01:33:40.917 --> 01:33:44.484
but to me that sounds
like a one-of-a-kind story.

01:33:46.585 --> 01:33:50.086
I don't know, I think that you could
make, like, baseball history.

01:33:51.117 --> 01:33:52.351
No?

01:33:57.185 --> 01:34:00.518
I just wanna know for myself
if I could've made it.

01:34:03.785 --> 01:34:05.916
Do you even like baseball?

01:34:05.918 --> 01:34:09.919
No, I like soccer.
You know that. You forgot?

01:34:10.418 --> 01:34:12.415
But I'll be at all the games.

01:34:12.417 --> 01:34:13.552
I'll go.

01:34:20.350 --> 01:34:22.552
You taste like chocolate.

01:34:29.118 --> 01:34:30.585
Hey, Sonny.

01:34:41.084 --> 01:34:42.718
Don't screw it up this time.

01:34:43.617 --> 01:34:44.651
I won't.

01:34:51.618 --> 01:34:52.719
Thanks.

01:35:16.985 --> 01:35:19.516
- Let's go, guys.
- Come on. Let's go.

01:35:26.517 --> 01:35:28.216
Come on!

01:35:38.418 --> 01:35:40.316
Hold him,
hold him, hold him!

01:35:51.485 --> 01:35:53.316
Look at me!

01:35:57.817 --> 01:35:59.352
Motherfucker!

01:36:38.885 --> 01:36:41.483
<i>Good evening,
Staten Island Empire fans.</i>

01:36:41.485 --> 01:36:43.715
<i>And welcome to
Staten Island Park.</i>

01:36:43.717 --> 01:36:45.682
<i>It's a beautiful day here.</i>

01:36:45.684 --> 01:36:48.918
<i>No ballpark anywhere
has this kind of view.</i>

01:36:50.852 --> 01:36:51.919
Come.

01:36:56.618 --> 01:36:59.752
Answer the phone, Sonny.
Come on, damn it.

01:37:00.251 --> 01:37:03.216
He's not answering my calls.
I don't know where the hell he is.

01:37:03.218 --> 01:37:04.485
I don't wanna scratch him.

01:37:05.217 --> 01:37:08.252
Check the parking lot, okay?
Make sure he's not running late.

01:37:08.985 --> 01:37:10.616
Has he called anybody?

01:37:10.618 --> 01:37:12.416
I'm the only body
he's supposed to call.

01:37:12.418 --> 01:37:13.983
No, he did not call me.

01:37:13.985 --> 01:37:16.052
Shit.

01:37:16.485 --> 01:37:19.217
- Yeah, hello?
- Where is he?

01:37:20.183 --> 01:37:22.983
- Your boy, Stano? Where is he?
- He's got the shits.

01:37:22.985 --> 01:37:25.748
- He's in the bathroom. Okay?
- <i>He a scratch?</i>

01:37:25.750 --> 01:37:28.015
- 'Cause we came here, right?
- He's gonna play,

01:37:28.017 --> 01:37:31.416
you're gonna see him. Let me get going,
will you? I gotta get this game going.

01:37:31.418 --> 01:37:32.786
All right, we'll wait.

01:37:33.585 --> 01:37:35.919
Says he's in the can.
Bullshit.

01:37:36.984 --> 01:37:38.551
Son of a bitch!

01:37:40.083 --> 01:37:41.484
All right, scratch him.

01:37:42.084 --> 01:37:43.583
Move Quavis up here.

01:37:43.585 --> 01:37:46.752
Put him in his spot.
Put Jones over there.

01:37:47.852 --> 01:37:48.951
Where is he?

01:37:49.650 --> 01:37:51.651
I'm gonna find out right now.

01:38:03.083 --> 01:38:05.949
<i>Pitching tonight
for the Birmingham Tracers...</i>

01:38:05.951 --> 01:38:08.915
- There goes my favorite redneck.
- <i>...former Cy Young winner...</i>

01:38:08.917 --> 01:38:10.515
He's throwing
the shit out of the ball.

01:38:10.517 --> 01:38:13.785
<i>Number 59, Roger Peterson.</i>

01:38:14.151 --> 01:38:15.619
We'll see about that.

01:38:19.817 --> 01:38:21.883
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

01:38:21.885 --> 01:38:26.316
<i>now taking the field,
your Staten Island Empires!</i>

01:38:32.485 --> 01:38:33.919
Is he okay?

01:38:34.350 --> 01:38:35.918
I'm sure he's fine.

01:38:56.751 --> 01:38:58.419
Strike!

01:39:00.551 --> 01:39:03.483
<i>It's the bottom of the ninth.
Last chance for the Empires,</i>

01:39:03.485 --> 01:39:06.449
<i>down one-nothing,
to the former World Series Champion</i>

01:39:06.451 --> 01:39:08.048
- <i>Roger Peterson...</i>
- Strike three, out!

01:39:08.050 --> 01:39:09.886
<i>...currently in the middle
of a no-hitter.</i>

01:39:10.450 --> 01:39:12.585
Sonny. Hey, Sonny.
What happened?

01:39:12.918 --> 01:39:15.484
- Got hit by a plane.
- Hit by a plane?

01:39:15.818 --> 01:39:17.882
- Sonny, let me see that.
- What's the score?

01:39:17.884 --> 01:39:19.782
Who cares what the score is.

01:39:19.784 --> 01:39:21.748
Come on. Let me bring
you inside to the medic.

01:39:21.750 --> 01:39:23.515
- Peterson's still in?
- Yeah, Peterson's still in.

01:39:23.517 --> 01:39:25.882
So what? Come on.
Sonny, let's go back...

01:39:25.884 --> 01:39:27.582
- I'm fine!
- All right, well, sit down!

01:39:27.584 --> 01:39:29.419
Sit down before you fall down.

01:39:30.351 --> 01:39:32.385
Let me see you.
Let me see this.

01:39:32.885 --> 01:39:34.382
Holy shit.

01:39:34.384 --> 01:39:35.682
Hey, get me some ice.

01:39:35.684 --> 01:39:36.785
How fast is he throwing?

01:39:38.050 --> 01:39:39.916
Peterson,
he's throwing a no-hitter against us.

01:39:39.918 --> 01:39:42.682
We got him 101, 102
on the gun. Come here.

01:39:42.684 --> 01:39:44.416
- <i>One out.</i>
- He have a curve?

01:39:44.418 --> 01:39:45.849
A curve, he's got a two-seam
and a four-seam

01:39:45.851 --> 01:39:47.751
and late-breaking shit.
Put this on.

01:39:48.884 --> 01:39:52.149
He's throwing some of the nastiest
stuff I've seen him throw in years.

01:39:52.151 --> 01:39:53.448
He's absolutely filthy.

01:39:53.450 --> 01:39:55.449
Tell me, where were you?
What happened?

01:39:55.451 --> 01:39:57.048
Who's up?

01:39:57.050 --> 01:39:58.181
- Holy shit.
- Come on!

01:39:58.183 --> 01:39:59.915
What the fuck hit you?

01:39:59.917 --> 01:40:01.181
Manny's on deck.

01:40:01.183 --> 01:40:03.282
Keep the ice on, Goddamn it!

01:40:03.284 --> 01:40:04.519
Manny.

01:40:05.950 --> 01:40:06.984
Get in his head.

01:40:08.951 --> 01:40:10.050
<i>Ya tu sabe.</i>

01:40:13.650 --> 01:40:15.381
- <i>Now batting, short stop...</i>
- Come here.

01:40:15.383 --> 01:40:17.316
- Get that shit out of my face.
- <i>...number 18,</i>

01:40:17.318 --> 01:40:18.985
<i>Manny Menendez.</i>

01:40:34.584 --> 01:40:36.585
- Jesus Christ!
- Hey, watch that guy!

01:40:36.951 --> 01:40:39.752
What's the matter, rook?
Got nothing to fucking say now?

01:40:40.350 --> 01:40:41.649
Okay!

01:40:53.417 --> 01:40:56.515
Oh, come on! What is that?
He's crowding the plate!

01:40:56.517 --> 01:40:58.518
What is this,
fucking Little League?

01:40:59.550 --> 01:41:01.551
<i>Menendez takes his base.</i>

01:41:03.384 --> 01:41:06.515
Shake it off, there, Manny.
Shake it off, Manny.

01:41:06.517 --> 01:41:07.585
Let it go.

01:41:08.851 --> 01:41:13.419
<i>Now batting, catcher,
number 33, Thor Digiorno.</i>

01:41:37.184 --> 01:41:39.181
- <i>And he's safe at second!</i>
- Manny!

01:41:39.183 --> 01:41:40.551
Yeah, brother.

01:41:42.585 --> 01:41:43.985
Fucking horseshit!

01:41:49.517 --> 01:41:51.018
Good work.

01:41:51.916 --> 01:41:53.716
- Put me in.
- You kidding me?

01:41:53.718 --> 01:41:56.051
You can't even hold the bat.
You should be sitting down.

01:41:56.650 --> 01:41:59.115
Strike!

01:41:59.117 --> 01:42:01.352
You said it.
Nobody can hit this guy.

01:42:01.751 --> 01:42:04.415
- I can take him.
- Yeah, not in your condition.

01:42:04.417 --> 01:42:06.217
There'll be another game, Sonny.

01:42:06.617 --> 01:42:09.050
You don't know that.
This might be it.

01:42:11.351 --> 01:42:12.685
I gotta know.

01:42:15.050 --> 01:42:16.485
I can do it.

01:42:27.751 --> 01:42:30.619
<i>Long fly ball to right field.</i>

01:42:34.883 --> 01:42:36.781
- Safe!
- Whoo! Whoo!

01:42:36.783 --> 01:42:39.349
<i>Tying run now
90 feet from home plate.</i>

01:42:39.351 --> 01:42:41.249
Bring the kid home.

01:42:41.251 --> 01:42:43.582
<i>Staten Island's
down to their last out.</i>

01:42:43.584 --> 01:42:44.817
Miller.

01:42:45.117 --> 01:42:47.318
<i>Now batting for the Empires,</i>

01:42:47.718 --> 01:42:49.918
<i>Sonny Stano!</i>

01:43:19.217 --> 01:43:20.317
Come on, come on!

01:43:22.585 --> 01:43:24.081
<i>Foul ball.</i>

01:43:24.083 --> 01:43:26.017
<i>Strike one.</i>

01:43:26.851 --> 01:43:30.085
What the fuck was that?
Are you kidding me?

01:43:31.151 --> 01:43:32.652
Don't waste my time.

01:43:53.816 --> 01:43:55.817
<i>Count now, 0-1.</i>

01:43:56.384 --> 01:43:58.117
<i>No balls, one strike.</i>

01:43:58.984 --> 01:44:02.583
<i>Swing and a miss. Strike two.</i>

01:44:05.184 --> 01:44:06.751
Come on, Stano.

01:44:24.017 --> 01:44:25.317
- Time.
- Time!

01:44:42.916 --> 01:44:45.714
- Time.
- What the fuck, guy? Come on!

01:44:45.716 --> 01:44:48.418
What are we doing?
Step in the box!

01:45:04.518 --> 01:45:07.215
Hey, blue, that's intentional!

01:45:07.217 --> 01:45:10.181
That's what you get when
you keep fucking around, Stano.

01:45:10.183 --> 01:45:12.748
<i>Ball one, count now, 1-2.</i>

01:45:15.917 --> 01:45:18.085
<i>Peterson is issued a warning.</i>

01:45:43.716 --> 01:45:45.050
Butcher boy.

01:45:50.084 --> 01:45:52.781
<i>Long fly ball to centerfield!</i>

01:45:52.783 --> 01:45:55.151
- Go, go, go!
- <i>And it's gone!</i>

01:45:56.251 --> 01:45:58.981
- Boom!
- <i>The Empires win it!</i>

01:46:07.916 --> 01:46:13.252
Stano! Stano! Stano!
