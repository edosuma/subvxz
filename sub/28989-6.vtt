WEBVTT

00:00.959 --> 00:02.199
(HARVEY READING)

00:02.294 --> 00:03.284
What is that?

00:03.378 --> 00:05.460
A list of ethical violations
Samantha Wheeler engaged in

00:05.547 --> 00:07.379
over the course of six
years as my attorney.

00:07.508 --> 00:09.715
I'm not ruining Samantha's
career. This is not a suggestion.

00:09.801 --> 00:12.168
It is an order, and if
you don't use this, I will,

00:12.262 --> 00:15.220
and if I do it, Alex, I'll be
going straight to the Bar.

00:15.307 --> 00:16.388
So what'd you find?
Nothing.

00:16.475 --> 00:18.091
Bullshit. We've had
information that your firm...

00:18.185 --> 00:20.267
I don't care what you've got,
and if you unseal my records,

00:20.354 --> 00:22.891
the firm of Rand Kaldor Zane
will come after you

00:22.981 --> 00:24.563
for malicious prosecution.

00:24.650 --> 00:26.732
I noticed I had
a voice mail from Brian.

00:26.818 --> 00:27.808
What did he say?

00:27.903 --> 00:29.314
I deleted it
without even listening.

00:29.404 --> 00:30.565
Katrina, that's amazing.

00:30.656 --> 00:31.646
Thank you, Donna.

00:31.740 --> 00:33.526
You bribed Charles Hu
to say I contacted him

00:33.617 --> 00:34.698
a year and a half ago.

00:34.785 --> 00:35.775
Now I can't dispute it

00:35.869 --> 00:38.281
because we're on record
saying this guy's a saint.

00:38.372 --> 00:39.453
Mike, I had nothing
to do with this.

00:39.540 --> 00:40.826
Well, if it wasn't you,
then it was her.

00:40.916 --> 00:41.906
You lied to me.

00:42.000 --> 00:45.868
All I did was produce a piece of evidence
that proves exactly what we know he did.

00:45.963 --> 00:48.455
You didn't produce I,
you fabricated it

00:48.549 --> 00:50.756
because you can't stand
someone getting the better of you.

00:50.842 --> 00:52.378
Well, I don't
trust you anymore.

00:53.428 --> 00:57.262
We were about to lose, and
evidence shows up that saves the day.

00:57.349 --> 00:59.465
Harvey didn't do anything.
Then it was you.

00:59.560 --> 01:01.801
As of this second,
you're fired.

01:07.985 --> 01:09.191
(CELL PHONE VIBRATING)

01:09.319 --> 01:10.309
Hello?

01:10.404 --> 01:12.020
FAYE ON PHONE: Did I
catch you at a bad time?

01:12.114 --> 01:13.229
What is it, Faye?

01:13.323 --> 01:17.408
I'm calling because I wanted you to
be the first to know I fired Samantha.

01:17.494 --> 01:18.484
What?

01:18.579 --> 01:21.662
I had reason to suspect she
crossed a line with Mike Ross.

01:21.748 --> 01:23.659
Reason to suspect,
or evidence?

01:23.750 --> 01:25.616
I don't need evidence.
She all but admitted it.

01:25.711 --> 01:27.622
Well, that doesn't sound
like something she'd admit to.

01:27.713 --> 01:30.125
I didn't call to debate
my decision, Donna.

01:30.215 --> 01:33.253
When I came here I laid down one
rule, play it straight or you're fired.

01:33.343 --> 01:35.209
I'm sorry, but she had to go.

01:35.304 --> 01:37.420
And why exactly are
you calling me with this?

01:37.514 --> 01:39.721
Because you pride yourself
on keeping this place together,

01:39.808 --> 01:41.845
and right now
your people need you.

01:41.935 --> 01:43.801
You mean you want me
to stop them from retaliating

01:43.895 --> 01:45.135
against your bullshit move.

01:45.230 --> 01:48.598
Donna, you and I both know your
colleagues are going to act against me,

01:48.692 --> 01:50.854
and it won't be through
proper channels.

01:51.028 --> 01:55.443
And if you don't stop them from doing it,
I don't see this firm surviving the year.

02:01.580 --> 02:02.991
Samantha,
what are you doing...

02:03.081 --> 02:04.913
I just got fired,
Robert.

02:05.000 --> 02:06.832
I didn't know
where else to go.

02:08.836 --> 02:11.249
Okay, why don't you come in,
tell me what happened.

02:11.340 --> 02:13.581
Well, I didn't come to
talk about what happened,

02:13.675 --> 02:15.461
I came to talk about
what's going to happen.

02:15.552 --> 02:16.838
Well, I can answer
that right now.

02:16.928 --> 02:18.384
Not a damn thing.

02:19.264 --> 02:21.847
Robert, she took my job.

02:21.933 --> 02:23.139
If you think I'm just
gonna sit back and...

02:23.226 --> 02:24.808
What I think is you
pulled some kind of shit

02:25.187 --> 02:26.769
with your
Mike Ross case.

02:26.855 --> 02:28.846
That's right.
I heard what happened.

02:28.940 --> 02:31.978
And I would bet my life
that Faye figured it out

02:32.069 --> 02:34.026
and the chickens have
come home to roost.

02:34.112 --> 02:35.773
So you're not
gonna help me?

02:35.864 --> 02:36.854
Of course I am.

02:36.948 --> 02:38.188
But knowing your partners,

02:38.283 --> 02:40.024
they're coming up with a
plan to get that woman out

02:40.118 --> 02:41.358
on her ass right now.

02:41.453 --> 02:45.071
So you are going to sit tight and
have faith in them to make it happen.

02:45.165 --> 02:47.782
I'm not so sure they are
coming up with a plan.

02:47.876 --> 02:48.866
Why not?

02:48.960 --> 02:51.918
Because Harvey's the reason
I got fired in the first place.

02:55.384 --> 02:56.419
LOUIS: Nice of you
to show up, Harvey.

02:56.510 --> 02:57.591
Don't give me
that shit, Louis.

02:57.678 --> 03:00.090
I came as soon as I
heard. What are we doing?

03:00.180 --> 03:02.012
I'll tell you what we're doing.
We're getting Samantha her job back.

03:02.099 --> 03:04.340
And like I was just saying,
Faye's never going to agree to that.

03:04.434 --> 03:07.096
She will if we could find
something on her we could use.

03:07.187 --> 03:10.396
Harvey, we try to play dirty, she
won't roll over, she'll expose us.

03:10.482 --> 03:11.893
Well, how do you suggest
we get Samantha back?

03:11.983 --> 03:13.189
Buy Faye a kitten?

03:13.276 --> 03:14.687
I'm not saying we don't
look for something.

03:14.778 --> 03:17.110
I'm saying when we find it,
we bring it to the Bar

03:17.197 --> 03:18.562
and we have them
remove her.

03:18.657 --> 03:20.443
And that's great, but they're not
just gonna give us the firm back.

03:20.534 --> 03:21.569
They're gonna send in
a replacement.

03:21.660 --> 03:23.446
So what? It can't
be worse than Faye.

03:23.537 --> 03:24.527
Bullshit, it can't.

03:24.621 --> 03:25.827
Am I the only one
who's seen Terminator 2?

03:25.914 --> 03:27.154
You've seen Terminator 2?

03:27.249 --> 03:28.785
I can't believe he's seen
Terminator 1.

03:28.875 --> 03:32.334
I can't believe we're still up here
talking instead of executing a plan.

03:32.421 --> 03:34.207
Speaking of which, what
exactly has Faye ever done

03:34.297 --> 03:36.504
to make us think that
she's anything but ethical?

03:36.591 --> 03:38.548
As far as I can tell,
her record is spotless.

03:38.635 --> 03:40.217
Well, I don't care
what her record is.

03:40.303 --> 03:42.761
Everybody's got something.
We just have to find it.

03:43.098 --> 03:44.259
Then it's agreed.

03:44.349 --> 03:47.011
We do whatever it takes to find
something to get her out that door.

03:47.102 --> 03:48.137
Agreed.

03:49.229 --> 03:50.264
Whatever it takes.

03:54.192 --> 03:57.401
(SINGING) See the money,
wanna stay for your meal

03:57.529 --> 04:00.521
Get another piece of pie
for your wife

04:00.657 --> 04:04.195
Everybody wanna know
how it feel

04:04.286 --> 04:07.495
Everybody wanna see
what it's like

04:07.581 --> 04:10.699
I'll even eat a bean pie
I don't mind

04:10.792 --> 04:12.578
Me and missy is so early

04:12.669 --> 04:14.330
Busy, busy making money

04:14.421 --> 04:15.456
All right!

04:15.547 --> 04:20.382
All step back
I'm 'bout to dance

04:21.928 --> 04:23.714
The greenback boogie

04:27.100 --> 04:28.966
You know, when I
took that bullet for you,

04:29.060 --> 04:30.050
it was because
I trusted that

04:30.145 --> 04:31.260
you would watch out
for Samantha.

04:31.354 --> 04:33.516
I am watching out for her,
Robert. We all are.

04:33.607 --> 04:34.972
Then tell me what you're
doing to get her back.

04:35.066 --> 04:37.603
We're digging into Faye
and we're gonna force her out.

04:37.694 --> 04:40.311
Well, that's a nice concept,
but what are the specifics?

04:40.405 --> 04:41.645
I'm working
on it, Robert.

04:41.740 --> 04:43.026
I don't wanna hear
that you're working on it.

04:43.116 --> 04:44.732
I wanna hear that
you're doing it.

04:44.826 --> 04:46.988
Unless there's some reason
that you don't want to do it.

04:47.078 --> 04:48.068
What's that
supposed to mean?

04:48.163 --> 04:50.951
It means that you read Samantha
the riot act for pulling the same shit

04:51.041 --> 04:54.284
you've done a thousand times,
only this time it was against Mike!

04:54.377 --> 04:56.414
Look, I came down on her
because she lied to my face.

04:56.505 --> 04:59.372
And I'd do it again, but that doesn't mean
I'm gonna let Faye come after my family.

04:59.466 --> 05:00.627
Well, I hate to
break it to you, Harvey,

05:00.717 --> 05:03.835
but you're the reason that Faye
fired Samantha in the first place.

05:03.929 --> 05:04.919
That's right.

05:05.013 --> 05:07.129
That thing
you would do again,

05:07.224 --> 05:10.888
you did in the middle of
Samantha's office and Faye saw it.

05:10.977 --> 05:12.559
Robert, I didn't know.

05:12.646 --> 05:14.353
Well, now you do.

05:14.439 --> 05:17.477
And I told Samantha that you
would move heaven and earth

05:17.567 --> 05:20.935
to get her back, so get upstairs
and start making it happen.

05:34.417 --> 05:35.407
KATRINA: Brian.

05:36.628 --> 05:38.210
What are you doing here?

05:38.296 --> 05:39.627
Didn't you get
my voice mail?

05:41.091 --> 05:43.799
I got it. I've just
been very busy.

05:43.885 --> 05:45.842
Well, that's too bad.

05:45.929 --> 05:48.512
I was hoping you'd have
time to prepare yourself.

05:48.598 --> 05:50.509
Prepare myself for what?

05:52.060 --> 05:54.552
I'm representing the
founder of Curt's Coffee.

05:54.646 --> 05:56.978
We believe he's entitled
to a piece of the company

05:57.065 --> 05:59.682
he didn't receive when
his partners forced him out.

05:59.776 --> 06:01.642
Curt wasn't forced
out of anything, Brian.

06:01.736 --> 06:03.022
He chose to leave.

06:03.113 --> 06:05.400
And he was fairly
compensated at the time.

06:05.490 --> 06:07.652
He was ripped off,
Katrina.

06:07.742 --> 06:09.232
I see what this is.

06:09.786 --> 06:11.197
You know the parties,

06:11.288 --> 06:13.279
and you think I'll cut you
a check to go away.

06:13.373 --> 06:14.363
No, I don't.

06:14.457 --> 06:16.323
And even if you tried
that, I wouldn't take it.

06:16.418 --> 06:17.908
And who's to say
it would be your choice?

06:18.003 --> 06:19.209
What do you mean?

06:19.296 --> 06:21.412
I mean, you have
a clear conflict.

06:21.506 --> 06:22.962
You represented them
when you worked here.

06:23.049 --> 06:25.006
So what's to stop me from
throwing you off the case?

06:25.093 --> 06:26.083
Nothing.

06:30.515 --> 06:32.472
Except I need this.

06:33.143 --> 06:36.852
This move
hasn't gone great,

06:36.938 --> 06:38.804
so when the partners
brought me this case...

06:38.899 --> 06:39.889
You couldn't say no.

06:39.983 --> 06:41.599
I didn't want to say no.

06:41.693 --> 06:44.731
Because taking on a lawyer
like you sends a message.

06:45.196 --> 06:46.857
All right, Brian.

06:46.948 --> 06:50.737
I won't throw you off the case, but
I will be filing a motion to dismiss.

06:50.827 --> 06:52.943
I'd expect nothing less.

06:57.667 --> 06:59.829
It's good
to see you, Katrina.

07:07.928 --> 07:08.963
HARVEY: Louis, good.

07:09.095 --> 07:10.927
Please tell me you thought
of a place to start digging.

07:11.014 --> 07:13.096
I did. Faye's first day here.

07:13.183 --> 07:16.016
Gretchen said the way she got
on the Bar's radar in the first place

07:16.102 --> 07:18.639
was by firing her husband
for doing something unethical.

07:18.730 --> 07:20.095
Then this is it.

07:20.190 --> 07:21.555
If anyone knows anything,
it'll be him.

07:21.650 --> 07:22.640
There's just one problem.

07:22.734 --> 07:24.441
What if he won't
talk shit about her?

07:24.527 --> 07:26.438
Louis, there's no way
someone's married to that woman

07:26.529 --> 07:28.520
for more than three days and
doesn't want to talk shit about her.

07:28.615 --> 07:29.776
That's not what I meant.

07:29.866 --> 07:31.573
Their divorce settlement
was sealed.

07:31.701 --> 07:32.987
So it's not that he won't
want to give us anything,

07:33.078 --> 07:34.193
he may not be able to.

07:34.287 --> 07:35.698
That's what I'm telling you.

07:35.789 --> 07:38.121
Well, if he's not willing
to give us what we need,

07:38.208 --> 07:39.949
then we're just gonna
have to make him.

07:42.504 --> 07:43.494
What's that?

07:43.588 --> 07:45.795
A lawsuit, and you're
the lead plaintiff.

07:45.882 --> 07:46.917
You want me
to sue my own firm?

07:47.008 --> 07:48.624
Not the firm. Faye.

07:48.718 --> 07:49.958
She clearly has a problem
with strong women.

07:50.053 --> 07:51.509
Alex...
Think about it.

07:51.596 --> 07:53.007
She tried to strip you
of your vote.

07:53.098 --> 07:54.930
She took Gretchen
from Louis against her will

07:55.016 --> 07:56.882
and now she fired
Samantha without proof.

07:56.977 --> 07:58.138
That's a pattern,
and we can win.

07:58.228 --> 07:59.889
I don't care what
you think we can do.

07:59.980 --> 08:02.517
I am not gonna go after another
woman under false pretenses.

08:02.607 --> 08:04.439
What's the matter with you?
We said "whatever it takes."

08:04.526 --> 08:05.516
Well, I didn't.

08:05.610 --> 08:06.975
And in case it hasn't gotten
through your head yet,

08:07.070 --> 08:08.811
shit like this is why she's
here in the first place.

08:08.905 --> 08:09.895
God damn it.

08:09.990 --> 08:12.732
You telling Thomas about that deal
is what got her here in the first place.

08:16.246 --> 08:18.954
I'm sorry, Donna. I
shouldn't have said that.

08:19.958 --> 08:22.040
Alex, what's going on?

08:22.210 --> 08:23.951
Faye asked me to spy
on Samantha

08:24.045 --> 08:27.254
because she suspected Samantha
might do exactly what she did.

08:27.340 --> 08:29.547
I could've warned her,
and I didn't.

08:29.634 --> 08:30.669
Alex.

08:31.803 --> 08:34.635
It's not exactly news that
Faye was keeping an eye on us.

08:34.722 --> 08:36.929
She told us that three
seconds after she got here.

08:37.017 --> 08:39.725
Samantha knew that, and she
chose to cross a line anyway.

08:39.811 --> 08:42.178
And, come to think of it, what do
you think she's doing right now?

08:42.272 --> 08:43.683
Probably nothing good.

08:43.773 --> 08:44.979
My thoughts exactly.

08:45.066 --> 08:47.854
So instead of feeling badly
about not warning her,

08:47.944 --> 08:50.436
I'd say you go stop her
from making things worse.

08:59.205 --> 09:01.697
Appreciate you
meeting me, Tom.

09:01.791 --> 09:02.781
I wasn't sure
you would.

09:02.876 --> 09:03.866
Neither was I.

09:03.960 --> 09:05.667
But I figured if you had
the balls to call me,

09:05.754 --> 09:07.620
I should at least
hear you out.

09:07.714 --> 09:11.878
Well, I can't say
I regret what I did,

09:12.010 --> 09:14.752
but there may be a way
for us to work together now.

09:14.846 --> 09:17.383
In other words,
you need something.

09:17.724 --> 09:18.930
I do.

09:19.017 --> 09:21.634
And I'd be willing
to owe you one in exchange.

09:21.728 --> 09:24.140
First, tell me what it
is you're looking for.

09:25.398 --> 09:27.639
A lawyer named
Faye Richardson.

09:27.734 --> 09:28.974
The Bar put her into our firm

09:29.069 --> 09:30.980
and I want to give them
a reason to pull her out.

09:31.071 --> 09:32.778
What makes you think
there's something to find?

09:32.864 --> 09:35.356
No one gets through life
without doing something.

09:35.533 --> 09:39.322
You want the FBI to go
on a fishing expedition?

09:39.412 --> 09:40.948
I can make that happen.

09:41.122 --> 09:43.033
But I'm not about
to get burned twice.

09:43.124 --> 09:46.333
So this time, before
I deliver for you,

09:47.170 --> 09:48.160
you're gonna
deliver for me.

09:51.800 --> 09:53.336
Gavin Andrews?

09:53.426 --> 09:55.292
You want me to
turn on my own client?

09:55.386 --> 09:58.003
Not your client. A client of
the firm that just fired you.

09:58.098 --> 10:01.432
And I'm still covered by privilege
for anything I knew before yesterday.

10:01.518 --> 10:03.384
Then get some shit
on him starting today.

10:03.478 --> 10:05.060
I can't. He doesn't
trust me anymore.

10:05.146 --> 10:06.261
Then this meeting is over.

10:06.356 --> 10:07.812
Damn it, there's
gotta be something...

10:07.899 --> 10:09.685
There is. This.

10:10.401 --> 10:12.267
You want my help,
this is the price.

10:12.362 --> 10:13.818
And it's not negotiable.

10:26.167 --> 10:27.874
Sorry to keep you
gentlemen waiting.

10:27.961 --> 10:29.747
Had to gather
these up and...

10:31.214 --> 10:32.204
All right.

10:33.007 --> 10:34.497
What's going on here?

10:34.592 --> 10:35.582
What are you
talking about?

10:35.677 --> 10:38.510
Well, I was told you two were
looking to buy a term life policy.

10:38.596 --> 10:41.714
But there's no way
he is marrying you.

10:42.350 --> 10:44.933
You know what, I have
a lot of great qualities

10:45.061 --> 10:47.223
and you don't know
a goddamn... Louis!

10:47.313 --> 10:49.145
Look, you're right.

10:49.232 --> 10:50.973
We're not here
to buy insurance.

10:51.067 --> 10:53.809
We're here because your
ex-wife is overseeing our firm.

10:53.903 --> 10:55.985
Let me just venture
a guess here.

10:56.072 --> 10:58.985
You two are not thrilled
with the way things are going,

10:59.075 --> 11:02.693
and you're looking to dig up
some dirt on her.

11:02.787 --> 11:06.075
But first we need to know
why you left the law.

11:06.166 --> 11:09.955
Well, I was just like you two,
a big-time corporate attorney.

11:10.044 --> 11:12.160
But I wasn't very happy
grinding out deals,

11:12.255 --> 11:15.464
so I took up
high-profile litigation.

11:15.550 --> 11:17.132
Class action.

11:17.218 --> 11:19.129
And class action
requires money.

11:19.220 --> 11:21.336
Money those people
didn't have.

11:21.556 --> 11:22.546
So what'd you do?

11:22.640 --> 11:25.974
I overbilled our three biggest
clients and I shifted the money around

11:26.060 --> 11:28.097
to finance
the contingency cases.

11:28.188 --> 11:29.474
And you got caught
when you lost.

11:29.564 --> 11:30.929
I never lost.

11:31.024 --> 11:32.731
Faye figured it out.

11:32.817 --> 11:35.775
She fired me on the spot
and then she ratted me out

11:35.862 --> 11:37.148
to the Ethics Board
the very next day.

11:37.238 --> 11:40.822
Fifteen years of marriage, and
she turned on me like it was nothing.

11:40.909 --> 11:42.946
Well, she might not be
wife of the year,

11:43.036 --> 11:45.403
but she's not exactly
looking like the bad guy here.

11:45.496 --> 11:47.533
Not to mention, you never
got your license taken away.

11:47.624 --> 11:49.911
Did I say that was
the end of the story?

11:50.001 --> 11:54.211
Faye used the threat of losing my
license as leverage in the divorce.

11:54.297 --> 11:56.334
And once she squeezed
the last nickel out of me,

11:56.424 --> 11:58.210
she called off the dogs.

11:58.384 --> 12:00.921
You're saying she
turned you over to the Bar,

12:01.012 --> 12:02.502
then undid the whole thing
just for money?

12:02.597 --> 12:03.837
If you don't
believe me,

12:03.932 --> 12:06.344
take a look at the terms
of the divorce settlement.

12:06.434 --> 12:09.552
The fact that they never took
my license and then you tell me

12:09.646 --> 12:12.809
that Faye didn't manipulate
the whole goddamn thing.

12:12.899 --> 12:15.561
Are you willing to show us that
settlement even though it's sealed?

12:15.944 --> 12:18.356
She already took me
to the cleaners once.

12:18.446 --> 12:20.483
What's she gonna do,
do it again?

12:27.538 --> 12:29.154
I'll be done
in a minute, Susan.

12:29.249 --> 12:30.865
I'm not here
for the copy machine.

12:30.959 --> 12:32.870
I wanted to talk to you.

12:32.961 --> 12:35.373
I couldn't help but notice
Brian here earlier today.

12:35.463 --> 12:36.999
Whatever it is,
Susan, get to it.

12:37.090 --> 12:38.455
Because if you're here
to blackmail me again...

12:38.549 --> 12:40.290
I'm not here
to blackmail you.

12:40.385 --> 12:41.375
I'm here to help you.

12:42.095 --> 12:44.962
I know how good Brian is and I
can imagine going up against him

12:45.056 --> 12:46.342
isn't going to be
easy for you.

12:46.432 --> 12:48.014
I'm a senior
partner, Susan.

12:48.101 --> 12:50.934
I'm more than capable of
handling myself in a court of law.

12:51.020 --> 12:54.558
I meant, if for some
reason things got personal

12:54.649 --> 12:57.232
between the two of you, I
already know what happened

12:57.318 --> 12:58.934
and I can be there
to support you.

12:59.028 --> 13:01.269
I don't know that you're
capable of supporting me.

13:01.364 --> 13:03.446
Katrina, you let me
off the hook for a reason.

13:03.533 --> 13:05.365
If you won't give me
a second chance,

13:05.451 --> 13:08.409
why didn't you just turn me
in to Faye in the first place?

13:10.498 --> 13:12.830
I'm filing a motion
to dismiss tomorrow.

13:12.917 --> 13:15.830
I want to be armed to
the teeth with case law.

13:15.920 --> 13:17.206
Consider it done.

13:24.220 --> 13:25.631
Hey, what's going on?

13:25.722 --> 13:28.134
Copies of that divorce
settlement came through.

13:28.224 --> 13:30.135
And?
His story looks legit.

13:30.226 --> 13:31.432
She cleaned him out.

13:32.228 --> 13:34.640
Harvey, you know, I gotta
tell ya, I don't trust this guy.

13:34.731 --> 13:37.393
I mean, maybe she did clean
him out, but think about it.

13:37.483 --> 13:40.851
Does doing something for
money really sound like Faye?

13:40.945 --> 13:43.152
No, it doesn't,
but he crossed a line,

13:43.239 --> 13:44.354
he didn't get disbarred,
and she got paid.

13:44.449 --> 13:46.156
So how else
do you explain it?

13:47.577 --> 13:48.567
Wait a second.

13:48.661 --> 13:50.447
Maybe the Faye we know needed
a little help getting there.

13:50.538 --> 13:51.528
Meaning?

13:51.622 --> 13:53.488
It's easy to not care about
money after you already have it.

13:53.583 --> 13:56.666
Are you saying she took his money
so she could become a special master?

13:56.753 --> 13:57.743
Look at the timeline.

13:57.837 --> 13:59.373
Right after the incident,
she leaves corporate law,

13:59.464 --> 14:01.796
takes a huge pay cut to
start working for the Bar

14:01.883 --> 14:04.420
and all of sudden it doesn't matter
because she's got a pile of money.

14:04.510 --> 14:06.000
Then the question is,
how do we prove it?

14:06.095 --> 14:08.052
Because this clown's word
isn't enough.

14:08.139 --> 14:11.302
Well, I'm not sure if it'll prove
it, but I know where to start.

14:18.149 --> 14:19.935
If you're picturing
Faye's face on that bag,

14:20.026 --> 14:21.141
you're not the only one.

14:21.235 --> 14:22.691
What are you
doing here, Alex?

14:22.779 --> 14:23.985
I'm here because
knowing you,

14:24.072 --> 14:25.688
you're not just working
on your left cross.

14:25.782 --> 14:27.022
And I'm here to help.

14:27.116 --> 14:28.948
You're right, I'm not
just hitting the bag.

14:29.035 --> 14:31.322
But what I need to do, you're
not gonna want any part of.

14:31.412 --> 14:32.493
Try me.

14:35.833 --> 14:38.541
I have to deliver
Gavin Andrews to the FBI.

14:38.628 --> 14:39.618
What?

14:39.712 --> 14:41.498
They know he's corrupt,
they just can't prove it.

14:41.589 --> 14:43.296
Well, now I know I
was right to come here

14:43.383 --> 14:44.498
because you're out of
your fucking mind.

14:44.592 --> 14:45.957
Alex...
Have you forgotten

14:46.052 --> 14:47.213
the list of shit
he has on you?

14:47.387 --> 14:48.752
You do this,
he'll figure it out,

14:48.846 --> 14:50.462
and you won't just be fired,
you'll end up in prison.

14:50.556 --> 14:51.921
Well, that's a risk
I'm willing to take.

14:52.016 --> 14:53.723
Samantha, it's just
a job. It's not worth it.

14:53.810 --> 14:54.925
It's worth it to me.

14:55.019 --> 14:58.057
Because I can't wake up
feeling this way every day.

15:01.275 --> 15:03.437
I didn't have
a family, Alex.

15:03.528 --> 15:06.691
And I'd get placed somewhere, and
just when I was finally feeling safe,

15:06.781 --> 15:09.523
the bottom would drop out
and they'd send me away.

15:10.284 --> 15:12.446
I didn't have a say
in anything.

15:12.537 --> 15:16.531
And I promised myself I would
never be that powerless again.

15:20.128 --> 15:23.120
Okay, we'll go after him.

15:23.214 --> 15:25.421
But we have to make sure
he doesn't know it's you,

15:25.508 --> 15:28.341
which is gonna be tough
because he doesn't trust you.

15:29.554 --> 15:32.046
Well, he'll have to trust me
if he thinks there's someone

15:32.140 --> 15:33.676
he can trust even less.

15:33.766 --> 15:35.052
Which there is.

15:35.184 --> 15:37.300
What are you talking
about? His niece.

15:37.395 --> 15:38.510
The one I gave you.

15:38.646 --> 15:41.559
I did tell her Gavin used her
name in that tax evasion racket.

15:41.691 --> 15:43.273
Which means she owes us one.

15:43.359 --> 15:44.941
And Gavin won't be thinking
about the gun he's got to your head

15:45.027 --> 15:46.017
if he's got one to his.

15:46.112 --> 15:47.227
Exactly.

15:47.321 --> 15:49.608
In that case,
I'll say good night.

15:49.699 --> 15:51.440
There's a phone call
I need to make.

15:56.372 --> 15:59.034
Gretchen, we have a
situation and we need your help.

15:59.125 --> 16:01.036
You two coming to see me
at the same time.

16:01.127 --> 16:02.583
Whatever it is,
must be serious.

16:02.670 --> 16:03.660
It is.

16:03.754 --> 16:05.040
Louis and I have
reason to believe

16:05.131 --> 16:06.542
that Faye manipulated
the Ethics Board

16:06.632 --> 16:08.919
for personal gain
15 years ago.

16:09.010 --> 16:11.377
We can use it to get rid
of her, but we'll need proof.

16:11.471 --> 16:13.212
And we're here to ask you to
reach out to anyone you know

16:13.306 --> 16:15.388
at your old firm, give
you anything you can.

16:15.475 --> 16:18.308
But, Gretchen, if Faye
finds out, she could fire you.

16:21.272 --> 16:24.185
Okay, I'll do it
on one condition.

16:24.275 --> 16:25.481
Name it.

16:25.568 --> 16:27.650
Harvey throws you
a baby shower.

16:27.737 --> 16:29.148
What?
That's a great idea.

16:29.238 --> 16:30.228
No, it's not.

16:30.323 --> 16:31.688
First of all, you're not
the one who's pregnant.

16:31.782 --> 16:33.944
Second of all, men
don't throw baby showers.

16:34.035 --> 16:35.150
Times have changed,
Harvey,

16:35.244 --> 16:36.484
and it just so happens I have
thoughts on a color scheme.

16:36.579 --> 16:37.569
HARVEY: Color scheme?

16:37.663 --> 16:39.199
Would you like me
to be Sheila's midwife, too?

16:39.290 --> 16:41.281
Now that you mention it, we
could really use a friendly...

16:41.375 --> 16:42.365
All right,
this is bullshit.

16:42.460 --> 16:44.326
We came to you with
a serious request.

16:44.420 --> 16:45.501
You turned it into a joke,
so you know what...

16:45.588 --> 16:47.829
You think
I'm joking here?

16:47.924 --> 16:49.540
I know how
goddamn serious this is.

16:49.634 --> 16:51.500
Louis said himself,
Faye catches wind of this,

16:51.594 --> 16:52.755
I'm out on my ass.

16:52.845 --> 16:54.631
And baby showers
aren't bullshit.

16:54.722 --> 16:56.554
It's what people who love
each other do for each other.

16:56.641 --> 16:59.429
Gretchen,
he doesn't need...

16:59.519 --> 17:01.476
Yes, he does.

17:01.562 --> 17:03.519
You see how much
it would mean to him.

17:03.606 --> 17:04.936
Why can't you just do it?

17:07.318 --> 17:09.855
I'll throw you
a baby shower, Louis.

17:09.945 --> 17:12.028
I'll get you what you need.

17:12.114 --> 17:13.229
Thank you.

17:26.546 --> 17:29.709
Katrina, you were supposed
to be here 15 minutes ago.

17:29.799 --> 17:31.335
They're in
the judge's chambers.

17:31.425 --> 17:32.631
I know. I got caught up.

17:32.718 --> 17:33.833
Are you okay?

17:33.928 --> 17:36.090
Yes, I'm fine, Susan.
Let's just get in there.

17:37.515 --> 17:39.472
BRIAN: Your Honor, Curt
Lassiter founded a company.

17:39.559 --> 17:40.924
He was happy.

17:41.018 --> 17:44.101
There was no reason for
him to leave, except one.

17:44.188 --> 17:45.804
His partners
forced his hand.

17:45.898 --> 17:47.935
That's ridiculous,
Your Honor.

17:48.025 --> 17:51.518
Mr. Lassiter forfeited any
future claims to Curt's Coffee.

17:51.612 --> 17:53.319
He signed the agreement.

17:53.406 --> 17:55.488
Except that agreement is
invalid because Curt was told

17:55.575 --> 17:57.862
if he didn't sign,
his shares would be diluted.

17:57.952 --> 18:00.319
So he did what anyone
under duress would do.

18:00.413 --> 18:01.653
He took what he could get.

18:01.747 --> 18:02.737
And you have proof of that?

18:02.832 --> 18:06.575
Those threats weren't put on paper,
which is why I need to compel testimony.

18:06.669 --> 18:10.003
So you can make a mockery of
the facts and paint Curt as a victim?

18:10.089 --> 18:11.750
He is a victim, Katrina.

18:12.883 --> 18:14.339
This wasn't what he wanted.

18:16.429 --> 18:20.718
Your Honor, case law
on this matter is clear.

18:20.808 --> 18:23.596
There has to be evidence
of duress to move forward.

18:23.686 --> 18:26.804
Do you have any precedent
for that, Ms. Bennett?

18:28.024 --> 18:29.355
Ms. Bennett?

18:29.442 --> 18:31.183
Do you have a rebuttal?

18:32.028 --> 18:33.939
Yes, Your Honor.

18:34.030 --> 18:37.614
Klein v. Bartis shows there needs to
be evidence of duress to move forward.

18:37.700 --> 18:39.862
And we need subpoena power
to get that evidence.

18:39.952 --> 18:42.444
Ms. Bennett, do you have
anything to say?

18:42.538 --> 18:44.779
As you're having
your associate speak for you,

18:44.874 --> 18:46.865
it seems like you're not
taking this matter seriously.

18:46.959 --> 18:49.747
I take it seriously,
Your Honor, I...

18:49.837 --> 18:51.919
Your Honor, I'd like to
ask for a continuance.

18:52.548 --> 18:55.961
Klein v. Bartis is
a complicated ruling

18:56.052 --> 18:57.793
and I'll need time to rebut.

18:57.887 --> 18:59.594
That is kind of you to say,
Mr. Altman,

18:59.680 --> 19:02.798
but I'm not hearing anything from
them to make me dismiss this case.

19:02.892 --> 19:06.385
And I would suggest the next time
you come before me, Ms. Bennett,

19:06.479 --> 19:07.765
that you come prepared.

19:13.903 --> 19:15.814
What are you
doing here, Donna?

19:15.905 --> 19:18.647
"Cause if you're looking to
reenact Top Gun, I'm all for it.

19:18.741 --> 19:20.448
This is serious, Harvey.

19:20.534 --> 19:22.275
I wanna talk
about our plan.

19:22.370 --> 19:23.451
What about it?

19:23.537 --> 19:25.198
Louis told me that
you went to see Faye's ex.

19:25.289 --> 19:26.495
And I know that you
don't want to hear this,

19:26.582 --> 19:28.823
but I think that's
a bad road to go down.

19:28.918 --> 19:30.829
Well, then, he didn't
tell you the full story

19:30.920 --> 19:32.627
because it's
leading somewhere.

19:32.713 --> 19:33.703
That's not what I meant.

19:33.798 --> 19:34.788
Faye called me
the other night.

19:34.882 --> 19:36.293
She knows
we're coming at her.

19:36.384 --> 19:37.374
So what?

19:37.468 --> 19:39.709
So you're digging into her
personal life. She's gonna find out.

19:39.804 --> 19:41.511
I don't give a shit
if she finds out about it.

19:41.597 --> 19:43.634
She made it personal
when she fired Samantha.

19:43.724 --> 19:45.306
Harvey, you're not
hearing me.

19:45.393 --> 19:47.509
She finds out about this,
she's gonna go ballistic.

19:47.603 --> 19:49.344
Damn it, Donna,
whose side are you on?

19:49.438 --> 19:50.599
Faye's or Samantha's?

19:50.690 --> 19:52.351
I'm on the side of
all of us, Harvey.

19:52.441 --> 19:55.775
Because we may need to get
Faye out, but if this thing goes too far,

19:55.861 --> 19:58.444
we may not have a firm
for Samantha to come back to.

19:59.907 --> 20:01.318
(CELL PHONE BUZZES)

20:03.786 --> 20:05.697
Gavin, what can I do for you?

20:05.788 --> 20:08.997
We've got a problem,
and her name is Darlene.

20:09.083 --> 20:10.619
What's the problem?

20:10.710 --> 20:13.247
The problem is, she's
developed some expensive tastes.

20:13.337 --> 20:14.327
And thanks to you,

20:14.422 --> 20:17.835
she's figured out she's got a rich uncle
that she's decided to use as an ATM.

20:17.967 --> 20:19.378
You're saying she's
blackmailing you.

20:19.468 --> 20:20.799
Yes, Alex, I am.

20:20.886 --> 20:22.877
And I need you
to make her go away.

20:22.972 --> 20:24.554
What exactly are you
asking me to do here, Gavin?

20:24.640 --> 20:26.597
Because if it's illegal,
I'm not doing it.

20:26.684 --> 20:28.391
Don't give me that
Boy Scout shit.

20:28.477 --> 20:29.467
You're the reason
she knows about

20:29.562 --> 20:31.553
my tax management strategy
in the first place.

20:31.647 --> 20:32.762
You mean your money
laundering scheme

20:32.857 --> 20:34.723
that you were using her and me
to help you get away with.

20:34.817 --> 20:36.854
Alex...
Gavin, I told you once,

20:36.944 --> 20:39.231
I'll tell you again,
I don't do shit like this.

20:40.030 --> 20:41.111
But you're in luck

20:41.198 --> 20:43.360
because Samantha Wheeler
doesn't work here anymore.

20:43.451 --> 20:44.532
And if you want to go to her,

20:44.618 --> 20:47.485
not as your lawyer,
but as a private citizen,

20:47.580 --> 20:49.446
then I strongly
advise against it.

20:50.207 --> 20:52.448
She won't do this for me.
She can't stand me.

20:52.543 --> 20:53.954
No, she can't.

20:54.044 --> 20:57.162
But she just lost her job, so,
as long as the price is right,

20:57.256 --> 20:59.042
I bet she'll do
whatever needs doing.

21:05.598 --> 21:08.761
Katrina, if this is about court
tomorrow, Susan already contacted me.

21:08.851 --> 21:09.841
It's not about that, Brian.

21:09.935 --> 21:12.768
I'm calling to tell you you
didn't need to do that today.

21:12.855 --> 21:14.971
Yes, I did. You weren't
providing effective counsel.

21:15.065 --> 21:17.773
And when I win this thing, I don't
want it appealed. Come on, Brian.

21:17.860 --> 21:19.646
You did that because you saw
that I was having a migraine.

21:22.865 --> 21:24.071
Okay, I did.

21:24.825 --> 21:25.860
But as long as
we're being honest,

21:25.951 --> 21:27.862
you were having that migraine
because of me.

21:27.953 --> 21:30.365
I know you're conflicted
about going against me on this

21:30.456 --> 21:33.824
and the reason I know that
is because I'm conflicted, too.

21:33.918 --> 21:35.875
That doesn't mean
you have to prop me up.

21:35.961 --> 21:38.419
Maybe not, but you could've
had me thrown off this case

21:38.506 --> 21:39.871
and you didn't.

21:39.965 --> 21:42.502
The least I could do
was return the favor.

21:43.302 --> 21:45.543
Okay, but I don't want you
thinking that I need charity

21:45.638 --> 21:47.254
or that I can't handle you.

21:47.348 --> 21:48.429
I don't think that.

21:48.516 --> 21:50.223
Then thank you.

21:50.309 --> 21:53.097
And you're right,
I am conflicted,

21:53.187 --> 21:55.849
because I've never been
involved in a case with you

21:55.940 --> 21:58.272
where I wasn't
rooting for you.

21:58.359 --> 22:00.475
Well, there's no rule that says just
because you're going against me

22:00.569 --> 22:01.559
you can't still
root for me.

22:01.654 --> 22:04.442
Actually, Brian, there is a rule
and that's exactly what it says.

22:04.907 --> 22:06.238
Good night, Katrina.

22:06.951 --> 22:08.533
See you in court, Brian.

22:12.665 --> 22:15.703
Thirty pounds overweight and
this is what you do for dinner?

22:16.335 --> 22:19.373
Faye, I didn't
know you cared.

22:19.463 --> 22:23.252
The only thing I care about is
that you keep making bad decisions.

22:23.342 --> 22:24.332
Such as”?

22:24.426 --> 22:26.588
Such as talking
to Harvey Specter

22:26.679 --> 22:28.261
or whoever else
came to you.

22:28.347 --> 22:29.462
I didn't talk
to anybody.

22:29.557 --> 22:30.888
Bullshit, George.

22:30.975 --> 22:31.965
Bernice called me,

22:32.101 --> 22:35.014
said someone was looking into
my communications from back then,

22:35.104 --> 22:37.220
and it took about five seconds
for me to figure out

22:37.314 --> 22:38.850
who pointed them
in that direction.

22:38.941 --> 22:40.102
Goddamn Bernice.

22:40.192 --> 22:42.308
Let's skip the part
where you blame someone else

22:42.403 --> 22:45.316
and get to the part where
you tell me what you told them.

22:45.489 --> 22:47.321
Nothing that wasn't true.

22:47.408 --> 22:49.240
I seriously doubt that.

22:49.326 --> 22:52.159
Well, come to think of it, I
may have left out a few details,

22:52.246 --> 22:55.489
but those two didn't seem to be
particularly interested in nuance.

22:55.583 --> 22:59.372
So I drew them a map and I
showed them exactly where to go.

23:00.629 --> 23:01.869
The Ethics Board.

23:01.964 --> 23:03.079
That's right.

23:03.173 --> 23:05.289
You're a Grade A
son of a bitch.

23:05.384 --> 23:07.295
And you're
a Grade A hypocrite.

23:07.386 --> 23:09.923
Walking around like
you never crossed a line.

23:10.014 --> 23:11.004
Well, you did.

23:11.098 --> 23:13.806
And when this is over, you're
gonna be out on your ass

23:13.893 --> 23:17.102
and I'll have done to you
exactly what you did to me.

23:21.442 --> 23:23.274
Susan, good.
What have you got?

23:23.360 --> 23:26.398
I think I know how we can go
after Curt Lassiter tomorrow.

23:26.488 --> 23:28.525
He says he never
wanted to leave his firm,

23:28.657 --> 23:30.193
but that's what
he's saying now.

23:30.284 --> 23:32.366
We need to know what
he was saying then.

23:35.247 --> 23:37.238
You want to get access
to his personal email account.

23:37.499 --> 23:39.160
Mmm-hmm. All we
need is one email

23:39.251 --> 23:41.367
where he says he's happy with
his payout and we've got him.

23:41.462 --> 23:44.124
It's a good idea,
Susan, but it won't work.

23:44.214 --> 23:46.797
There's no way Brian would
ever allow personal emails

23:46.884 --> 23:47.919
to be part of this case.

23:48.010 --> 23:49.876
He will if you
force him to.

23:50.387 --> 23:52.378
And how on earth
would I do that?

23:52.473 --> 23:54.180
By using your history
with Brian to show

23:54.266 --> 23:57.179
there's no difference between
the personal and the professional.

23:58.938 --> 24:02.476
Susan, you're suggesting exposing
intimate details of Brian's life

24:02.566 --> 24:04.898
when we don't even know
if we'll find anything.

24:04.985 --> 24:06.066
But we might.

24:06.236 --> 24:08.648
And the jury is always
going to sympathize

24:08.739 --> 24:10.855
with a founder who got
booted from his own company.

24:14.119 --> 24:16.531
Is this because you still
have feelings for Brian?

24:16.622 --> 24:20.616
It's because I was having a migraine
today and he tried to let me off the hook.

24:20.709 --> 24:22.791
Something was going on,
that much was obvious.

24:22.878 --> 24:26.121
But, Katrina, just
because you're his soft spot

24:26.215 --> 24:28.798
doesn't mean
he has to be yours.

24:41.730 --> 24:43.596
Okay, you got me here.

24:43.691 --> 24:45.102
This better be good.

24:45.192 --> 24:47.149
My niece is
coming after me.

24:47.236 --> 24:48.351
So what?

24:48.445 --> 24:50.982
Why aren't you calling Alex
Williams with this instead of me?

24:51.073 --> 24:53.815
"Cause you've always been
willing to do things he won't.

24:53.909 --> 24:56.321
What specifically is
she coming after you for?

24:56.412 --> 24:58.995
She wants $10 million,
or she's threatening

24:59.081 --> 25:00.992
to come forward
with everything she has

25:01.083 --> 25:02.573
on my money
laundering operations.

25:02.668 --> 25:05.160
And exactly how much
does she know?

25:05.254 --> 25:08.087
Enough to put me away
for a long time.

25:10.259 --> 25:13.001
Okay, give the money to me
and I'll give it to her.

25:13.095 --> 25:16.304
No one ever has to know, but
I'll record her accepting a bribe.

25:16.390 --> 25:18.802
And if she ever comes
calling again, we have her.

25:18.892 --> 25:20.803
So I'm supposed to just
give her the money?

25:20.894 --> 25:23.727
Short of killing her, I don't
see any other way out of this.

25:23.814 --> 25:26.397
And, Gavin,
I'm not doing that.

25:26.859 --> 25:29.726
And how do I know you're not just
gonna keep the money for yourself?

25:29.820 --> 25:32.312
Because you're gonna pay me
$5 million for doing this damn thing.

25:32.406 --> 25:35.023
You want half of what I'm
giving her just to record someone?

25:35.117 --> 25:36.699
It's not just recording
someone, asshole.

25:36.785 --> 25:38.321
It's taking part
in covering up a crime.

25:38.412 --> 25:40.995
And, Gavin, if you don't get
someone to do this for you,

25:41.081 --> 25:42.867
$10 million is a drop
in the bucket.

25:42.958 --> 25:45.040
She'll take you for
another 50 and you know it.

25:45.127 --> 25:47.084
There's my girl.

25:47.171 --> 25:49.378
I gotta say, you're a
lot more fun to work with

25:49.465 --> 25:51.001
than Saint Alex
of Midtown.

25:51.842 --> 25:53.048
I've missed this.

25:53.135 --> 25:54.591
Well, I haven't.

25:54.678 --> 25:56.419
Get me the money,
and I'll get you your tape.

26:03.645 --> 26:06.103
Ms. Bennett, I see you're
here with another motion.

26:06.190 --> 26:08.181
I hope it's more cogent
than your last one.

26:08.275 --> 26:09.356
It is, Your Honor.

26:09.443 --> 26:11.150
I would like to
expand discovery

26:11.236 --> 26:14.103
to include Curt Lassiter's personal
emails during the period in question.

26:14.198 --> 26:16.405
Your Honor, that's
an invasion of privacy

26:16.492 --> 26:17.823
and not at all
pertinent to the case.

26:17.910 --> 26:18.900
Isn't it?

26:18.994 --> 26:22.407
Mr. Altman's own argument
is that Curt was forced out

26:22.498 --> 26:24.205
through unofficial
conversations.

26:24.291 --> 26:26.202
That's no reason to dig
into my client's private life.

26:26.293 --> 26:28.625
What precedent are
you citing, Ms. Bennett?

26:28.712 --> 26:30.703
My precedent isn't
legal, Your Honor.

26:30.798 --> 26:33.335
It's how life is.

26:33.425 --> 26:36.292
When you work with
people for a long time,

26:36.386 --> 26:38.923
relationships become personal
and lines get blurred.

26:39.014 --> 26:40.925
Objection, Your Honor.
That's speculation.

26:41.016 --> 26:42.882
No, Brian. It isn't.

26:44.269 --> 26:46.510
You used to be
my associate, correct?

26:46.814 --> 26:47.975
I did.

26:48.065 --> 26:50.352
And isn't it true we had
personal conversations

26:50.442 --> 26:53.184
inside the office and work
conversations outside?

26:53.320 --> 26:55.527
That's true, but I don't
see how... But nothing.

26:55.614 --> 26:58.276
At some point, you stopped
thinking of me as your superior,

26:58.367 --> 27:01.530
and we became more
than coworkers, didn't we?

27:01.620 --> 27:03.782
Yes, we did.

27:03.872 --> 27:06.534
Then I have every right
to your client's emails.

27:06.625 --> 27:09.458
But what if they reveal things
having nothing to do with this case

27:09.545 --> 27:10.876
that he doesn't want
in the world?

27:10.963 --> 27:14.081
Do you think I'm the kind of lawyer
who would smear a man's character?

27:14.174 --> 27:18.008
I think you have more integrity
than any lawyer I've ever met.

27:18.095 --> 27:20.962
JUDGE: That doesn't sound like
much of an objection, Mr. Altman.

27:21.056 --> 27:23.889
You'll hand over those
emails immediately.

27:24.017 --> 27:25.178
(GAVEL BANGS)

27:27.354 --> 27:29.812
Harvey, can I have
a word with you?

27:29.898 --> 27:32.811
Sorry, Faye. My days
of talking to you are over.

27:34.069 --> 27:35.434
I know you went
to see George.

27:35.529 --> 27:36.940
So what?

27:37.030 --> 27:38.987
So I wanna know
what he told you.

27:39.074 --> 27:40.064
The truth.

27:40.159 --> 27:41.445
That you leveraged him
to get money

27:41.535 --> 27:43.492
after you found out
he was committing a crime.

27:43.579 --> 27:46.537
Well, I hate to tell you
this, but that's not the truth.

27:46.623 --> 27:49.536
You gonna say you didn't keep
him from being investigated by the Bar

27:49.626 --> 27:51.583
and then he didn't
miraculously agree

27:51.670 --> 27:53.627
to give you all his money
in the divorce settlement?

27:53.714 --> 27:55.955
That's the thing
George is good at.

27:56.049 --> 27:58.256
Twisting details
to sound true.

27:58.343 --> 28:00.425
I did keep them from
investigating him

28:00.512 --> 28:02.048
and I made him give me
the money.

28:02.139 --> 28:03.971
But what he
left out was,

28:04.057 --> 28:06.515
I stayed there three more
years and didn't take a salary

28:06.602 --> 28:08.969
so I could make
his clients whole.

28:09.062 --> 28:11.349
Bullshit. Why would you
do that if you hated the man?

28:12.983 --> 28:14.439
Because I have a daughter.

28:14.526 --> 28:18.770
And I didn't want her to grow up
knowing that her father was a criminal.

28:18.864 --> 28:20.025
There it is.

28:20.115 --> 28:21.321
There's the truth.

28:21.408 --> 28:24.150
SO you can expose me,
but you'll be shattering

28:24.244 --> 28:27.157
my daughter's conception
of her father.

28:28.540 --> 28:30.372
Well, here's what
we're gonna do.

28:30.459 --> 28:32.496
You're gonna
hire Samantha back.

28:32.586 --> 28:33.951
Then you're gonna resign.

28:34.046 --> 28:35.502
And we're gonna
call it even.

28:35.589 --> 28:37.171
I can't do that.

28:37.257 --> 28:38.418
I'm sorry,
what did you say?

28:38.508 --> 28:40.294
I can't horse trade
my way out of this.

28:40.385 --> 28:41.375
I don't believe this.

28:41.470 --> 28:44.258
You let this piece of shit off
scot-free, but you won't bring her back

28:44.348 --> 28:45.838
for something you
don't even have proof of?

28:45.933 --> 28:47.423
I have all the
goddamn proof I need.

28:47.517 --> 28:49.508
Because just three days ago,
you were in that office

28:49.603 --> 28:51.935
yelling at her for this
and I saw you.

28:52.689 --> 28:55.272
Well, you might as well
start packing your shit, Faye,

28:55.359 --> 29:00.695
because as soon as I find proof
of what you did, you're gone.

29:06.328 --> 29:09.616
I crossed one line
in my career.

29:09.706 --> 29:13.449
I hated doing it,
but I did it.

29:13.543 --> 29:14.999
For my child.

29:16.129 --> 29:19.042
Samantha did what
she did to win a case.

29:20.759 --> 29:22.466
That's not the same thing.

29:30.060 --> 29:31.721
Katrina,
I found something.

29:31.812 --> 29:33.348
What is it?

29:33.438 --> 29:36.055
An email chain from
Lassiter to his best friend

29:36.149 --> 29:38.231
bragging about the yacht
he was about to buy

29:38.318 --> 29:40.650
with the proceeds
from his awesome deal.

29:43.532 --> 29:45.068
Susan, this is great.

29:45.158 --> 29:46.614
We can use it to force
a settlement.

29:46.702 --> 29:48.488
Settlement? We don't
need to settle.

29:48.578 --> 29:50.239
This is proof
they're lying.

29:50.330 --> 29:53.243
And didn't you say Brian refused
to even consider a settlement?

29:53.333 --> 29:55.574
Yes, but now
we have leverage.

29:55.669 --> 29:58.206
This isn't leverage, this
is an outright dismissal.

29:58.297 --> 29:59.628
You don't know that.

29:59.715 --> 30:02.377
And any time you move
forward with litigation,

30:02.467 --> 30:04.128
anything can happen.

30:04.219 --> 30:06.085
I know what is happening.

30:06.179 --> 30:07.965
You're trying to
give him a way out.

30:08.056 --> 30:09.296
And don't tell me
I'm wrong.

30:09.391 --> 30:10.973
All right,
you're not wrong.

30:11.059 --> 30:13.175
Brian needs this not to be
a total annihilation.

30:13.270 --> 30:14.977
I thought you said
you don't care about him.

30:15.063 --> 30:16.974
I don't, not in that way.

30:17.065 --> 30:18.055
Then what way?

30:18.150 --> 30:21.188
Because you're putting his interests
over our client's, and that's not right.

30:21.278 --> 30:23.235
Don't you talk to me
about what is right.

30:23.322 --> 30:25.233
I have been doing
what is right.

30:25.324 --> 30:27.565
I cut Brian out of my life,
but he's still a friend

30:27.659 --> 30:30.401
and I don't want
to do this to him.

30:30.495 --> 30:32.532
Katrina, I hear you.

30:32.622 --> 30:34.989
But if this case was
against any other lawyer,

30:35.083 --> 30:37.120
we'd be out
celebrating right now.

30:37.210 --> 30:38.416
But it's your call.

30:44.760 --> 30:45.921
Good, you're here.

30:46.011 --> 30:47.126
What is it, Louis?

30:47.220 --> 30:48.301
Gretchen came through.

30:48.388 --> 30:49.753
Two emails from
Faye Richardson

30:49.848 --> 30:52.010
to members of the Bar
specifically asking to quash

30:52.100 --> 30:53.716
any investigation
into her husband.

30:53.810 --> 30:55.392
It's all there in black
and white, Harvey.

30:55.479 --> 30:56.594
We got her.

30:57.939 --> 30:59.054
All right.

31:00.192 --> 31:01.682
Let's do this.
Hold on a second.

31:01.777 --> 31:02.938
What's going on?

31:03.028 --> 31:04.268
Nothing's going on,
Louis.

31:04.363 --> 31:06.354
Harvey, I've seen you
win enough times

31:06.448 --> 31:07.938
to know that this is
not what you look like.

31:08.033 --> 31:09.023
What is it?

31:09.117 --> 31:11.154
You were right,
that son of a bitch lied.

31:11.244 --> 31:14.407
She didn't take him to the cleaners
just so she could have the money.

31:14.498 --> 31:17.581
She did it to cover up his crime,
so her daughter would never know.

31:17.667 --> 31:19.078
But that means
if this comes out,

31:19.169 --> 31:20.830
it'll destroy that girl's
vision of her father.

31:20.921 --> 31:22.787
Not to mention her mother
who's kept it from her.

31:22.881 --> 31:24.292
She's a grown woman.
She can handle it.

31:24.383 --> 31:26.465
Handle what? You painting
her as a liar and a cheat?

31:26.551 --> 31:28.383
I'm not painting her as
anything. She did this.

31:28.470 --> 31:31.087
And we said we'd get
Samantha back, whatever it takes.

31:31.181 --> 31:32.546
So this is what
it's gonna take.

31:33.809 --> 31:35.516
What if there
was another way?

31:35.602 --> 31:37.138
What other way?

31:37.229 --> 31:38.640
Alex and Samantha
are working on something.

31:38.772 --> 31:40.354
What if whatever
they find gets her out

31:40.440 --> 31:42.101
without doing something
like this to a family?

31:43.610 --> 31:46.068
One day.
They have one day.

31:46.154 --> 31:48.816
Then I'm pulling the trigger
whether you like it or not.

31:52.202 --> 31:54.944
Since when did you start
working bankers' hours?

31:55.288 --> 31:58.451
Robert. What are
you doing here?

31:58.542 --> 31:59.873
I'm here to see you.

31:59.960 --> 32:01.871
Well, whatever it is,
it'll have to wait.

32:01.962 --> 32:03.452
Joy has a
piano recital and...

32:03.547 --> 32:04.708
Bullshit, she does.

32:04.798 --> 32:07.631
You're getting in that car
to meet Samantha.

32:07.717 --> 32:09.253
All right, you got me.

32:09.344 --> 32:11.585
She cut a deal with the
FBI, and I'm helping her.

32:11.680 --> 32:12.841
Helping her how?

32:13.890 --> 32:16.678
We're giving them Gavin Andrews
in exchange for dirt on Faye.

32:16.768 --> 32:18.509
Gavin Andrews? Are you
out of your damn mind?

32:18.603 --> 32:20.389
He's got information on her,
and if he finds out...

32:20.480 --> 32:21.470
It doesn't matter.

32:21.565 --> 32:22.646
The way we're doing it,
Gavin will never know...

32:22.732 --> 32:24.097
Says every inmate
sitting in prison

32:24.192 --> 32:25.603
that thought they
committed the perfect crime.

32:25.694 --> 32:27.150
Robert...
Alex, listen to me.

32:27.237 --> 32:28.773
I know you're trying
to do right by her,

32:28.864 --> 32:31.572
but even if Gavin doesn't
figure out what she's up to,

32:31.658 --> 32:33.524
she has a history
with the FBI.

32:33.618 --> 32:35.325
What kind of history?

32:35.412 --> 32:37.153
The kind that could come
back and bite her in the ass.

32:37.330 --> 32:40.118
I appreciate that, Robert, but
the train has left the station.

32:40.208 --> 32:42.119
Then do me one favor.

32:44.546 --> 32:46.412
Let me get in that car
instead of you.

32:56.516 --> 32:58.598
Robert, what are
you doing here?

32:58.685 --> 32:59.846
I'm here to help you.

32:59.936 --> 33:01.722
Help me or stop me?
Both.

33:01.813 --> 33:03.269
Because if you do
what you're about to,

33:03.356 --> 33:04.596
the FBI is going to
have something over you

33:04.691 --> 33:06.273
for the rest of your life.

33:06.359 --> 33:07.849
I'm not giving up
the plan.

33:07.944 --> 33:08.934
I'm not asking you to.

33:09.029 --> 33:12.897
I'm asking you to be quiet and
let me be a lawyer one last time.

33:12.991 --> 33:14.277
What's going
on here?

33:14.367 --> 33:16.233
We were supposed
to meet alone.

33:16.328 --> 33:18.444
Well, my client and I
had other ideas.

33:18.538 --> 33:21.621
She's not gonna give you
anything until you sign this.

33:26.379 --> 33:29.212
Blanket immunity for
anything you've ever done.

33:29.299 --> 33:30.289
I don't think so.

33:30.383 --> 33:33.375
Not anything
she's ever done.

33:33.553 --> 33:36.170
Anything she's ever done
for the man she's giving you.

33:36.264 --> 33:37.550
I don't have authority
to sign this.

33:37.641 --> 33:38.631
Bullshit, you don't.

33:38.892 --> 33:40.382
This is a onetime offer
good for 30 seconds.

33:40.477 --> 33:41.467
Take it or leave it.

33:41.561 --> 33:43.518
Robert. Samantha,
I'm handling this.

33:43.605 --> 33:45.892
Jesus, you are Robert Zane.

33:45.982 --> 33:47.768
You're not even a lawyer.

33:47.859 --> 33:51.602
I don't have to be a goddamn
lawyer for this to be legally binding.

33:51.696 --> 33:53.528
So sign it or not,

33:53.615 --> 33:56.528
because you're not getting
what she has without it.

34:12.592 --> 34:14.333
Look at that,
you came through.

34:14.427 --> 34:15.417
I did.

34:15.512 --> 34:17.378
Now you're giving me
everything you got on Faye.

34:17.472 --> 34:19.429
Not a goddamn thing.

34:19.516 --> 34:22.349
Turns out I couldn't find
anything on the woman.

34:22.435 --> 34:24.551
Just like you couldn't
find anything way back when.

34:24.646 --> 34:26.387
We had a deal.
What deal?

34:26.606 --> 34:30.440
You might have immunity on
paper, but that's all you have on paper.

34:30.527 --> 34:32.859
Don't ever call me again.

34:32.946 --> 34:34.152
You son of a bitch.

34:38.827 --> 34:40.612
Whatever it is
you're thinking about doing,

34:40.704 --> 34:42.411
it isn't gonna happen.

34:42.496 --> 34:46.114
Because I'm not getting out of this
booth until we talk this thing through.

34:55.594 --> 34:57.926
Katrina, what are
you doing here?

34:58.013 --> 34:59.253
We found his emails.

34:59.347 --> 35:01.964
Curt lied about
being forced out.

35:02.058 --> 35:03.514
I'm here to end this.

35:03.602 --> 35:05.343
And I wanted
to do it in person.

35:05.437 --> 35:06.802
What about settling?

35:06.896 --> 35:08.603
It's too late for that.

35:08.690 --> 35:12.775
Unless you drop this by tomorrow,
we're going to countersue for slander.

35:13.278 --> 35:14.689
I'm sorry, Brian.

35:15.864 --> 35:17.525
You can't blame him
for trying.

35:17.616 --> 35:19.027
What do you mean?

35:19.159 --> 35:20.900
Curt wasn't entirely lying.

35:20.994 --> 35:25.579
He may not have been forced
out, but he regretted leaving.

35:25.665 --> 35:28.282
Are you talking
about him or you?

35:28.376 --> 35:30.037
Can it be both?

35:30.754 --> 35:33.746
Your partners didn't assign
you this case, did they?

35:33.840 --> 35:35.877
You took it.
I did.

35:35.967 --> 35:38.709
I knew they were going after
you and then you called and...

35:38.803 --> 35:40.510
And what?
I missed you.

35:42.223 --> 35:43.964
So I took the case...

35:45.143 --> 35:47.555
Because I wanted
to spend time with you.

35:48.188 --> 35:49.929
I can't believe you.

35:50.023 --> 35:53.937
That's why you wouldn't settle?
To spend more time with me?

35:54.027 --> 35:55.609
Katrina...
No.

35:55.695 --> 35:58.813
What did you think would happen
when we spent that time together?

35:58.907 --> 36:00.773
I thought we would
see each other and talk

36:00.867 --> 36:03.108
and be in each other's
lives like we used to.

36:03.203 --> 36:04.944
And then?
I don't know.

36:05.038 --> 36:06.949
Well, what I know
is that

36:07.040 --> 36:09.077
I wanted to keep working
together as friends.

36:09.167 --> 36:11.499
You couldn't do it.
You left.

36:11.586 --> 36:14.669
God damn it, there's nothing
wrong with missing someone, Katrina.

36:14.756 --> 36:17.714
There is for me.
Because I have to move on.

36:19.844 --> 36:21.334
And so do you.

36:24.015 --> 36:25.050
So that's it?

36:25.141 --> 36:28.304
We just never
see each other again?

36:31.064 --> 36:32.930
You have our terms.

36:33.024 --> 36:35.231
You can pursue
this case or don't,

36:35.318 --> 36:37.434
but if you don't drop
this case by tomorrow,

36:37.529 --> 36:39.770
Brian, I will
have you removed.

36:45.328 --> 36:47.035
DONNA: Can I talk to you
for a second?

36:47.122 --> 36:49.739
I just got off the phone
with Samantha.

36:50.625 --> 36:52.286
Their plan didn't work.

36:53.878 --> 36:55.744
That settles it, then.

36:55.839 --> 36:57.671
That's what I'm here
to talk about, Harvey.

36:57.757 --> 36:59.464
I don't think it does.

36:59.551 --> 37:01.963
I don't believe this. So
you're taking Louis's side?

37:02.053 --> 37:03.134
Yes, I am.

37:03.221 --> 37:05.553
And quite frankly, I don't
understand why you're not.

37:05.640 --> 37:06.675
Well, let's see.

37:06.766 --> 37:09.007
We all wanted her gone,
this is a one-way ticket out

37:09.102 --> 37:10.638
and what the fuck else
is there to talk about?

37:10.770 --> 37:12.056
Harvey. What is
it with all of you?

37:12.147 --> 37:14.639
Don't you get it? She is
never gonna stop coming.

37:14.733 --> 37:17.691
Zane's name, Louis's
title, Samantha's job...

37:17.777 --> 37:18.983
This isn't about her.

37:19.070 --> 37:21.402
I don't want to be a part of
doing this to someone's family.

37:21.489 --> 37:22.820
What about what
she did to our family?

37:22.907 --> 37:24.113
She didn't kill
anyone, Harvey.

37:24.200 --> 37:25.690
She was just
doing her job.

37:25.785 --> 37:27.571
And I'm the reason
she fucking did it.

37:28.705 --> 37:31.072
Faye saw me yelling
at Samantha, Donna.

37:31.166 --> 37:32.372
That's how she knew.

37:32.459 --> 37:33.540
Oh, my God.

37:33.626 --> 37:34.991
We could've had
this fight anywhere.

37:35.086 --> 37:37.202
The roof, the street,
the file room...

37:37.714 --> 37:39.204
None of this
would've happened.

37:39.299 --> 37:40.915
But instead,
I chose to have it

37:41.009 --> 37:43.046
right in the middle of the
office, where anyone could see it.

37:44.304 --> 37:45.419
I get it now.

37:49.642 --> 37:51.553
Harvey, if there is one thing
that I love about you,

37:51.644 --> 37:54.978
it's your sense of loyalty. But
when you add guilt on top of that...

37:55.440 --> 37:56.976
What are you saying?

37:59.319 --> 38:01.026
Imagine you could
go back in time

38:01.112 --> 38:03.820
and not know about your
mother what you knew.

38:03.907 --> 38:07.070
Wouldn't you do that
for yourself?

38:07.994 --> 38:09.735
It was my fault, Donna.
I know that.

38:12.749 --> 38:14.160
But doing this...

38:16.336 --> 38:19.374
It's not the man
I want you to be.

38:20.256 --> 38:23.248
And I know it's not
the man you want to be.

38:28.431 --> 38:29.967
What's that?

38:30.058 --> 38:31.344
Just came in.

38:31.434 --> 38:33.266
They're dropping
the case.

38:36.064 --> 38:37.805
Why are you
giving this to me?

38:39.692 --> 38:43.936
Susan, what I did for Louis
when I was his associate

38:44.030 --> 38:49.742
and Brian did for me was about
more than just legal brilliance.

38:49.828 --> 38:53.071
It was also about
having the person's back.

38:53.164 --> 38:57.783
And just as important, telling
them when they're wrong.

38:57.877 --> 39:01.245
Are you thanking me for
telling you you were wrong?

39:01.339 --> 39:04.627
I'm explaining why
I'm giving this to you.

39:04.717 --> 39:07.800
Because I like my associates
to keep a record of their wins.

39:07.887 --> 39:10.049
Are you saying
you're making me your...

39:10.139 --> 39:11.300
Yes, Susan, I am.

39:11.391 --> 39:14.304
Unless you keep asking
questions, In which case, you're not.

39:16.396 --> 39:17.511
I won't let you down.

39:17.605 --> 39:18.811
I know you won't.

39:18.898 --> 39:20.138
Now go home.

39:20.233 --> 39:21.314
Not having a life

39:21.401 --> 39:23.688
is what got me into trouble
with Brian in the first place.

39:31.786 --> 39:33.151
(LAUGHS)

39:40.920 --> 39:42.081
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

39:42.171 --> 39:43.206
Faye.

39:44.716 --> 39:46.127
What can I do for you?

39:46.885 --> 39:50.344
It's been enough time that if
Harvey were going to go to the Bar,

39:50.430 --> 39:51.886
he would've already.

39:51.973 --> 39:55.841
And it doesn't take Einstein to
figure out who convinced him not to.

39:55.935 --> 39:58.097
You asked me to keep
the firm together.

39:58.187 --> 39:59.677
That's what I did.

40:01.357 --> 40:02.973
How'd you do it?

40:03.067 --> 40:05.729
How'd you get him
to back off?

40:05.820 --> 40:09.654
I thought what if you were my
mother and you'd done that for me.

40:10.325 --> 40:12.066
The rest just came out.

40:13.077 --> 40:14.818
Thank you, Donna.

40:16.122 --> 40:20.036
Faye, for the record, we didn't
do this for self-preservation.

40:20.126 --> 40:22.743
Because no matter
what you may think of us...

40:24.172 --> 40:26.880
There are some lines
we won't cross.

40:36.142 --> 40:37.883
Okay, what was so important
that I needed to come over

40:37.977 --> 40:39.217
at this time of night?

40:39.312 --> 40:41.349
I wanted to say
I'm sorry.

40:41.439 --> 40:43.726
Because we both know
you'd still be at the firm

40:43.816 --> 40:46.183
if it wasn't for me
yelling at you like an idiot.

40:46.277 --> 40:47.859
It's okay, Harvey.

40:47.946 --> 40:49.732
I'm the one who
crossed the line.

40:49.822 --> 40:51.187
It's not just that,
Samantha.

40:51.282 --> 40:53.398
We found a way
to get Faye out.

40:53.493 --> 40:55.075
I didn't take it.

40:55.161 --> 40:57.118
And I wanted you
to hear that from me.

40:57.205 --> 40:59.947
Donna already
told me, Harvey.

41:00.041 --> 41:03.625
And for what it's worth, I
think you did the right thing.

41:03.711 --> 41:06.203
You're the last person I
would expect to hear that from.

41:06.297 --> 41:09.415
Well, if you'd asked me an
hour ago, you wouldn't have.

41:09.509 --> 41:15.221
But she watched out for her child
and I wish I had a parent like that.

41:16.432 --> 41:18.173
Samantha, what's going on?

41:18.267 --> 41:20.929
A few weeks ago,
I hired an investigator

41:21.020 --> 41:22.931
and I just found out
where my biological father is.

41:23.439 --> 41:24.725
Pittsburgh.

41:24.816 --> 41:26.272
Pittsburgh.
Yeah.

41:26.359 --> 41:29.067
And I was gonna go tomorrow
but Robert's going to visit Rachel

41:29.153 --> 41:31.190
and they can't cancel.

41:32.281 --> 41:33.897
Samantha, what is it?

41:36.452 --> 41:39.035
I don't wanna go alone.

41:39.122 --> 41:42.831
Well, if I'm not too
deep in your doghouse,

41:43.042 --> 41:45.875
I certainly could use
a break from Faye.

41:45.962 --> 41:48.169
You'd really go with me?

41:48.256 --> 41:49.417
I would.

41:50.133 --> 41:52.966
Well, in that case, you are
not too deep in my doghouse.

41:53.052 --> 41:54.338
Okay, then.

41:54.429 --> 41:56.796
I'll pick you up
in the morning.

41:56.889 --> 41:58.129
Okay.

41:58.224 --> 41:59.714
Thank you, Harvey.
