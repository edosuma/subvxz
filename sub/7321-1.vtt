00:08.308 --> 00:11.573
<i>We all remember</i>
<i>bedtime stories of our childhoods.</i>

00:11.611 --> 00:15.479
<i>The shoe fits Cinderella,</i>
<i>the frog turns into a prince,</i>

00:15.515 --> 00:18.416
<i>Sleeping Beauty is awakened with a kiss.</i>

00:18.451 --> 00:20.248
<i>Once upon a time.</i>

00:20.286 --> 00:23.119
<i>And then they lived happily ever after.</i>

00:23.156 --> 00:26.887
<i>Fairy tales. The stuff of dreams.</i>

00:26.926 --> 00:30.726
<i>The problem is,</i>
<i>fairy tales don't come true.</i>

00:30.764 --> 00:35.167
<i>It's the other stories, the ones</i>
<i>that begin with dark and stormy nights,</i>

00:35.201 --> 00:37.533
<i>and end in the unspeakable...</i>

00:37.570 --> 00:41.233
<i>It's the nightmares that</i>
<i>always seem to become reality.</i>

00:45.345 --> 00:48.872
What happened!?

00:49.582 --> 00:51.709
A bus in front of him
hit a telephone pole.

00:51.751 --> 00:53.685
- He tried to swerve to miss it...
- How bad is it?

00:53.720 --> 00:55.813
You are gonna have to be strong.

00:57.457 --> 01:00.358
Derek!

01:03.997 --> 01:06.522
No... No!

01:26.820 --> 01:29.789
No! No!

01:29.823 --> 01:32.053
Derek!

01:32.092 --> 01:34.890
No!

01:34.928 --> 01:39.058
No! Derek!

01:46.806 --> 01:50.401
<i>The person that invented</i>
<i>the phrase "Happily ever after,"</i>

01:50.443 --> 01:52.843
<i>should have his ass kicked so hard.</i>

01:55.715 --> 01:57.842
Back up,
you're sucking all my oxygen.

01:57.884 --> 02:00.182
- I'm trying to see.
- It's not up yet.

02:00.220 --> 02:02.688
- It supposed to be posted at four.
- It's 4:15.

02:02.722 --> 02:05.418
Hit the refresh button.
You have to reload the page.

02:05.458 --> 02:07.824
I am hitting the button
every ten seconds.

02:07.861 --> 02:08.953
- Is it up yet?
- No.

02:08.995 --> 02:10.656
- Hi.
- Hi.

02:10.697 --> 02:12.665
- Is it up yet?
- No. Wait.

02:12.699 --> 02:15.634
Think we move up a slot.
Pass Hopkins, move to number one.

02:15.668 --> 02:19.900
- Not passing Hopkins. We'll stay two.
- Mayo could surge ahead. We'd be three.

02:19.939 --> 02:22.066
- Three? Pessimist.
- Realist.

02:22.108 --> 02:25.839
Rankings of teaching hospitals
change based on any number of things.

02:25.879 --> 02:28.006
Three's top five.
I can live with three.

02:28.047 --> 02:31.312
- Hit the refresh button.
- Stay back! I'm doing this.

02:31.351 --> 02:33.376
- Is it up yet?
- No!

02:33.419 --> 02:36.650
- Here, hit the refresh...
- I am hitting the refresh...!

02:36.689 --> 02:39.954
OK, all of you, back up.
Stop hovering. Stop speculating.

02:39.993 --> 02:44.054
The rankings will go up when they go up.
We have no control when they are posted.

02:44.097 --> 02:46.930
When it is up, I will say it is!
Until then, back up.

02:46.966 --> 02:49.127
- Leave me alone so I can...
- It's up!

02:50.303 --> 02:53.329
Number one, Hopkins.
Number two, Mayo...

02:53.373 --> 02:54.397
Told you.

02:54.440 --> 02:56.738
- Number three, Cleveland Clinic.
- What?

02:56.776 --> 02:58.937
- Number four, Mass Gen.
- What?

02:58.978 --> 03:00.570
We moved down to five?!

03:00.613 --> 03:03.878
No. We are not five.

03:03.917 --> 03:06.647
- Twelve, O'Malley.
- It's so upsetting...

03:06.686 --> 03:08.881
This is not a number 12
teaching hospital.

03:08.922 --> 03:10.014
It's a great...

03:10.056 --> 03:13.492
I do not run the number 12
surgical program. Out with it!

03:13.526 --> 03:16.893
We've been downgraded from
Level One trauma center to Level Two.

03:16.930 --> 03:18.329
What does that mean?

03:19.432 --> 03:24.165
You don't need to explain,
it's just details...

03:28.074 --> 03:29.371
Twelve.

03:29.409 --> 03:32.572
I couldn't ask him about when
he's gonna schedule my test,

03:32.612 --> 03:34.944
with all the you-know-what
hitting the fan.

03:34.981 --> 03:38.314
For all I know he's gonna spring it
to me, what, like, in an hour.

03:38.351 --> 03:41.809
You'll be ready.
Causes of hypotension?

03:41.854 --> 03:46.689
Uh, hypovolemia, Ml,
cardiac dysrhythmia...

03:48.228 --> 03:49.354
Uh...

03:49.395 --> 03:51.454
- Hypoxia... Is that good?
- Very good.

03:51.497 --> 03:52.896
Yeah? What?

03:54.467 --> 03:58.836
The snow... it's so pretty.
It's like a fairy tale.

03:58.871 --> 04:02.466
Lexie, it's... it's the fall.

04:02.508 --> 04:05.739
It's not so much a fairy tale
as global warming.

04:05.778 --> 04:07.678
That's the Apocalypse.

04:07.714 --> 04:10.148
It's like dropping to number 12.

04:10.883 --> 04:14.046
And me failing my intern test
for the second time.

04:17.290 --> 04:20.781
I adore you, by the way... Just...

04:21.793 --> 04:24.092
Oh! Hey, sorry I'm late.
I was just helping...

04:24.130 --> 04:26.064
No talking unless it's medical.

04:26.099 --> 04:28.897
So I keep having the dream.
The Derek is dead dream.

04:28.935 --> 04:31.597
Know who does residencies
at number 12 hospitals?

04:31.638 --> 04:35.039
Losers. And I am not a loser.
Go get the charts.

04:35.074 --> 04:38.737
So the dream is about me being
afraid of the house of candles,

04:38.778 --> 04:42.373
taking the big step. And I'm afraid
of having a happy ending.

04:42.415 --> 04:45.179
I have a PhD in biochem.
I am a double doctor.

04:45.218 --> 04:49.211
Double doctors should not do
residencies at second rate hospitals.

04:49.255 --> 04:52.520
Wyatt says I should just
lean into the wind. Into the fear.

04:52.558 --> 04:54.958
So I'm gonna ask Derek
to move in with me.

04:54.994 --> 04:58.293
I could transfer. Cleveland Clinic
has a huge cardio program.

04:58.331 --> 05:01.425
- Still top 20. Pretty good.
- Pretty good is not enough.

05:01.467 --> 05:03.594
I want to be great. Greatness.

05:03.636 --> 05:06.469
Which is why I'm going
to ask Derek to move in with me.

05:06.506 --> 05:10.772
Just that's it's a big step. Don't wanna
mess up, I've messed it up before...

05:10.810 --> 05:14.541
The break ups and the on and off again,
and the sleeping with George.

05:14.580 --> 05:16.480
You slept with George?

05:18.117 --> 05:20.244
No talking unless it's medical.

05:22.088 --> 05:24.818
So, I'm just gonna do it.
I'm gonna ask him to move in.

05:24.857 --> 05:26.449
You think it's the right thing?

05:26.492 --> 05:29.723
Ugh. Bailey's paging.

05:31.097 --> 05:36.501
Uh, so, medically, Meredith and
George had sexual intercourse?

05:36.536 --> 05:38.902
Uh, when? And how many times?

05:44.711 --> 05:46.872
- It's humiliating. Twelve.
- Yeah.

05:46.913 --> 05:50.747
You're the best neurosurgeon
in the country. In the world.

05:52.418 --> 05:54.249
You wanna say anything about me?

05:54.287 --> 05:56.585
You're the best plastics guy
at Seattle Grace.

05:56.622 --> 05:59.785
- Nice. Really nice.
- Don't force me to praise you.

06:01.728 --> 06:05.186
- Hey, Rose.
- Hello, Dr. Sloan.

06:05.231 --> 06:06.528
Mm.

06:07.600 --> 06:10.967
She took it well in the beginning,
hoping we could be civilized.

06:11.003 --> 06:13.699
- She working my OR.
- Civilized is out. It's gone.

06:13.740 --> 06:17.267
It's a trail of fairy dust.
Now she's got delayed rage.

06:17.310 --> 06:19.608
- Delayed rage?
- She was being big before.

06:19.679 --> 06:22.341
Putting on a brave face.
She's had time to think.

06:22.382 --> 06:25.044
She hates your guts.
You have to break up with her.

06:25.084 --> 06:27.416
- I did.
- You did personally.

06:27.453 --> 06:30.786
Now you have to do it professionally.
Good luck with that.

06:32.325 --> 06:34.225
Delayed rage.

06:42.802 --> 06:44.827
I'd like a list.

06:44.871 --> 06:48.034
From you of ways that I can improve.

06:49.075 --> 06:50.269
Not right now.

06:50.309 --> 06:52.777
Richard, you told me
that I'm a bad teacher.

06:52.812 --> 06:55.872
Now we're number 12,
and I don't like to be number 12,

06:55.915 --> 06:58.315
- so I'd like a list.
- Not right now.

07:00.086 --> 07:02.486
But if there are ways
that I can improve,

07:02.522 --> 07:05.423
ways that I can help
the program regain its ranking.

07:05.458 --> 07:08.894
It's snowing. You know
what happens when it's nighttime,

07:08.928 --> 07:12.625
snowing and the temperature's
hovering right around 32 degrees?

07:12.665 --> 07:14.360
- No.
- The snow begins to melt.

07:14.400 --> 07:17.597
And then it freezes again
creating black ice.

07:17.637 --> 07:21.300
The deadliest kind of ice,
because it is invisible to drivers.

07:21.340 --> 07:23.740
That'd usually mean
that our ER would fill up.

07:23.776 --> 07:27.075
But Mercy West is a number one level
trauma center and we're not.

07:27.113 --> 07:30.105
Their ER gets the traumas
while we get their castoffs.

07:30.149 --> 07:31.810
Which pisses me off.

07:31.851 --> 07:35.116
So when I say not right now,
what I mean is not right now.

07:40.860 --> 07:42.293
Oh, um...

07:53.506 --> 07:56.066
Stop shivering.
You're embarrassing me.

07:56.108 --> 07:58.474
I didn't realize we were
gonna be outside.

08:00.346 --> 08:03.838
- I'm OK. You don't have to do that.
- Bundle up. You're turning blue.

08:03.883 --> 08:06.852
- Dr. Bailey, it is kinda cold...
- Someone will come.

08:06.886 --> 08:10.083
- No one is coming.
- Maybe old people with hips we can fix.

08:10.122 --> 08:12.556
Stop talking.
We are Seattle Grace Hospital.

08:12.592 --> 08:16.221
Rankings or no rankings,
we are going to stand outside.

08:16.262 --> 08:17.854
At the ready. On alert.

08:17.897 --> 08:21.890
Give the best care available to
every patient that arrives at our door.

08:21.934 --> 08:25.995
We may no longer be ranked the best,
but I'm the best. You are my residents.

08:26.038 --> 08:29.474
Which means you're the best.
It's a matter of pride, people.

08:29.509 --> 08:32.376
What are we doing?

08:32.410 --> 08:34.241
- We're waiting.
- For?

08:34.280 --> 08:36.874
- A miracle.
- Someone will come.

08:36.916 --> 08:40.215
- Mercy West is getting traumas first...
- Someone'll come.

08:40.253 --> 08:43.813
So we're here in the hopes
that someone is severely injured?

08:43.856 --> 08:47.155
Wishing and praying that someone
is so hurt, so near death,

08:47.193 --> 08:49.354
that the ambulance has to bring 'em here

08:49.395 --> 08:51.522
- 'cause we're closer than Mercy.
- Yep.

08:51.564 --> 08:54.533
Wow. You and God are cool with that?

08:57.236 --> 08:58.760
Damn it. I forgot about God.

08:58.804 --> 09:01.329
All right, let's just
go on back inside...

09:07.880 --> 09:09.814
Go, go, go! Watch out!

09:15.121 --> 09:17.521
- Are you OK?
- I drove a limousine on ice!

09:17.557 --> 09:19.684
All by myself! Ten blocks!

09:24.597 --> 09:25.621
You OK?

09:25.665 --> 09:28.190
My dress.
There's blood all over my dress.

09:28.234 --> 09:31.260
- What happened?
- I got us to the hospital in one piece.

09:31.304 --> 09:34.239
Try not to move.
Sit until we can get you a wheelchair.

09:34.273 --> 09:35.740
We need a wheelchair!

09:35.775 --> 09:39.108
We're not the patients...
What's his name...?

09:39.145 --> 09:40.703
- Benny... Billy.
- Billy?

09:40.746 --> 09:43.681
Our limo driver.
He flew through the windshield.

09:44.917 --> 09:46.509
Help him, please.

09:48.254 --> 09:50.518
Uh, Yang, come around, help me.

09:50.556 --> 09:53.616
Get a board,
bring out a gurney and a c-collar.

09:55.428 --> 09:57.919
Wha...

09:59.465 --> 10:01.296
Wha...? Press it. Press.

10:09.008 --> 10:11.169
- What do we have?
- Billy Matthews, 45.

10:11.210 --> 10:13.201
Arterial bleed,
haven't isolated cause...

10:13.245 --> 10:15.076
I got this. Get him to Trauma One...

10:15.114 --> 10:18.083
- Holding pressure over the bleed...
- I've got this.

10:18.517 --> 10:19.745
Wha...

10:22.888 --> 10:24.321
What's going on?

10:25.291 --> 10:28.124
Vincent will worry if I'm late.

10:28.160 --> 10:29.991
You've been in a car accident.

10:30.029 --> 10:33.396
You're at the hospital.
We're going to take good care of you.

10:33.933 --> 10:35.560
Is she OK?

10:35.601 --> 10:39.264
Might be a concussion. I'm gonna order
a CT to make sure it's nothing.

10:39.305 --> 10:42.206
All this blood. Should've
waited for the ambulance.

10:42.241 --> 10:44.004
We did. They never came.

10:44.043 --> 10:46.603
Billy was hanging through
the windshield.

10:46.646 --> 10:50.980
You extracted your limo driver
from the windshield? By yourselves?

10:51.017 --> 10:53.417
- Pretty heroic.
- Isn't Michael answering?

10:53.452 --> 10:55.181
No. Try Phil again.

10:56.656 --> 11:00.285
Shouldn't have even been going to
the stupid ball in a storm like that.

11:00.326 --> 11:02.021
- What ball?
- Fire and Ice Ball.

11:02.061 --> 11:03.688
Would you believe? In a storm?

11:03.729 --> 11:07.597
Just goes to voicemail.
Maybe their phones are off.

11:07.633 --> 11:10.363
- Can't reach Vincent?
- Husbands were in another car?

11:10.403 --> 11:11.870
We won't ride with them.

11:11.904 --> 11:16.000
We're three happily married women except
when our husbands drag out cigars,

11:16.042 --> 11:18.875
and they drag out
the cigars in the limo.

11:18.911 --> 11:21.539
Your arm is not broken, just bruised.

11:21.580 --> 11:24.413
O'Malley is gonna suture
your cuts and you're all set.

11:24.450 --> 11:26.975
You're lucky you didn't
sustain more injuries.

11:27.019 --> 11:30.455
- What doctor are you? You're young.
- I'm an intern.

11:30.489 --> 11:35.324
Interns don't touch the face.
The plastic surgeon touches the face.

11:35.361 --> 11:37.192
What's happening?

11:39.632 --> 11:41.497
Where am I?

11:41.534 --> 11:44.264
We were in an accident.

11:44.937 --> 11:48.236
You're OK. We're all going to be fine.

11:53.679 --> 11:56.113
- Hi.
- Hi.

11:56.148 --> 11:58.241
I've been really busy.

11:58.284 --> 12:00.878
I know, I've been, like, crazy.

12:00.920 --> 12:03.286
Researching things. A lot of research.

12:03.322 --> 12:05.290
- In the library.
- Oh, yeah? Me too.

12:05.324 --> 12:10.626
Incredibly busy. Lot of research.
Like you. Only I use the Internet.

12:12.598 --> 12:14.964
- I've got to check in with Bailey.
- Me too.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.935
- Bailey, anything else?
- Nothing. Nothing else.

12:17.970 --> 12:20.200
That's the problem. I'm charting.

12:20.239 --> 12:24.676
The chief took my one trauma, I
gave up my clinic and now I'm charting.

12:24.710 --> 12:27.076
Chief wanted you
to take a look at these.

12:27.113 --> 12:32.016
Billy Matthews, limo driver,
multiple crush injuries from the MVC.

12:32.051 --> 12:33.916
Hemopericardium.

12:35.988 --> 12:40.721
Hemopericardium can lead to cardiac
tamponade which can be detected by

12:40.760 --> 12:46.255
increased JVP,
hypotension, and muffled heart sounds.

12:47.633 --> 12:51.262
This is a teaching hospital.
I'm trying to improve my teaching.

12:51.303 --> 12:52.327
Don't try it on me.

12:52.371 --> 12:54.168
- Wanna know how I teach?
- No.

12:54.206 --> 12:57.972
I'm like a guru. They come to me
for help and I gently guide them

12:58.010 --> 13:00.672
along the path to truth and wisdom.

13:01.280 --> 13:03.748
Hey, George. I heard a thing.

13:03.783 --> 13:07.082
A surprising thing.
A very unexpected non-medical thing.

13:07.119 --> 13:08.950
- About you and...
- Hold on...

13:08.988 --> 13:12.890
Dr. Sloan, hi. Sarabeth Briar's
got a facial lac,

13:12.925 --> 13:16.122
- but she will only let you touch her.
- You paged me for a cut?

13:16.162 --> 13:17.823
What kind of moron are you,

13:17.863 --> 13:22.357
are you a special moron from the
Isle of Complete and Utter Morons?

13:23.002 --> 13:24.401
- I don't...
- Shut up.

13:25.471 --> 13:26.529
Truth and wisdom.

13:29.608 --> 13:31.041
He's an ass.

13:37.983 --> 13:39.951
This is what we get for being 12.

13:39.985 --> 13:43.250
A bunch of women in ball gowns
and a half-dead limo driver.

13:43.289 --> 13:45.450
Those women are amazing,
tried to save his life.

13:45.491 --> 13:47.482
- That's who I wanna be.
- An aging princess?

13:47.526 --> 13:50.689
They've been with the same men
for years and they're happy.

13:50.729 --> 13:52.697
They did it. I could do it.

13:52.731 --> 13:54.130
- Mer...
- Hey.

13:54.967 --> 13:55.991
Who paged me?

13:57.436 --> 14:00.132
Bailey and Izzie paged you.
You should see Bailey.

14:00.239 --> 14:02.366
- She's got the limo driver.
- OK.

14:03.475 --> 14:06.069
- Wanna move in with me?
- Wanna live together?

14:06.111 --> 14:09.512
- Well, I mean, I could... I just...
- Yes.

14:09.548 --> 14:11.140
- Yes?
- You sure you're ready?

14:11.217 --> 14:14.050
I'm leaning into the fear
to get a happy ending.

14:14.086 --> 14:15.849
I don't even know what that means.

14:15.888 --> 14:17.651
Damn it!

14:17.690 --> 14:20.454
Time of death, 20:47.

14:26.966 --> 14:29.901
Limo driver, traumatic arrest.

14:29.935 --> 14:31.903
Never regained a pulse.

14:31.937 --> 14:34.531
Tell them not to book the OR.

14:39.144 --> 14:41.806
- I have a dream, Yang.
- Excuse me?

14:41.914 --> 14:47.944
That one day, a trauma will come
through those doors. I have a dream.

14:47.987 --> 14:52.617
- I share that dream.
- Number 12.

14:52.658 --> 14:54.751
Number 12.

14:54.793 --> 14:58.786
Right now dispatch is squawking
about three men. Three.

14:58.831 --> 15:03.165
Serious injuries every one.
They're taking them to Mercy West.

15:03.202 --> 15:06.000
- Three men?
- That's what I said.

15:06.038 --> 15:09.269
Three men who could be married
to those ladies in ball gowns?

15:10.242 --> 15:13.439
- Little stick.
- Squeeze my hand, squeeze my hand.

15:13.479 --> 15:16.915
- Just like when you had Pete, remember?
- Ugh! Pete hurt less.

15:16.949 --> 15:20.214
You're gonna love me later
when there's virtually no scar.

15:20.252 --> 15:24.484
Ladies, um, I've been on the phone
with ambulance dispatch.

15:24.523 --> 15:29.119
Three gentlemen in a limo collided
with another vehicle on Broad Street.

15:29.161 --> 15:31.288
- Possible it was your husbands.
- Oh, no.

15:31.330 --> 15:34.060
- Taking them to Mercy West.
- Across town.

15:34.099 --> 15:37.000
Unless you prefer
that they be brought here.

15:37.036 --> 15:39.630
- We can do that?
- Oh! You can insist.

15:39.672 --> 15:41.640
If I were you, I would insist.

15:41.674 --> 15:45.405
Oh. Then, I guess... I guess we insist.

15:45.444 --> 15:48.106
- Yes, we insist.
- You insist.

15:54.019 --> 15:57.455
Am I to understand that you stole
these traumas from Mercy West?

15:57.489 --> 16:00.754
- No idea what you are talking about.
- Good job. It's personal.

16:00.793 --> 16:02.693
Yang, come with me.

16:05.597 --> 16:06.859
We got a situation.

16:06.899 --> 16:09.197
Fifty-eight-year-old male, MVC.

16:09.234 --> 16:14.365
Tacking 160. VP, 80 palp.
Decrease bilateral and breath sounds.

16:14.406 --> 16:16.340
- What did you do?
- I didn't. He did.

16:16.375 --> 16:19.310
Gl Joe trached him in the field
before I got there.

16:19.345 --> 16:21.609
With a pen?!
You trached with an ink pen?

16:21.647 --> 16:23.080
So?

16:24.917 --> 16:28.318
Move this guy inside. Now!
Let's go. Move, move, move, move.

16:28.354 --> 16:30.379
Pen Trach?

16:34.393 --> 16:35.519
Hot.

16:41.433 --> 16:42.457
OK, what do we got?

16:42.501 --> 16:45.061
Vincent Kenner, 58,
unrestrained passenger

16:45.104 --> 16:49.165
of a limo that took a nosedive. Muffled
heart sounds and a large scalp lac.

16:49.208 --> 16:50.675
- Vincent!
- Betty...

16:50.709 --> 16:53.007
I'm sorry, Dr. Hahn, but she...

16:53.045 --> 16:55.878
That's my husband.
What happened? Is he all right?

16:55.914 --> 16:58.542
I promise to give you an update
as soon as we know,

16:58.584 --> 17:00.609
but right now I have to get you to a CT.

17:00.652 --> 17:02.711
- Vincent!
- I'll bring you back.

17:02.755 --> 17:05.690
- Free fluid in the abdomen.
- Depressed skull fracture.

17:05.723 --> 17:07.919
Decreased breath sounds, bilaterally.

17:07.960 --> 17:10.223
Guy's getting an
express ticket to the OR.

17:10.262 --> 17:12.195
- Let the chief know.
- Can I scrub in?

17:12.231 --> 17:13.357
Fine.

17:13.398 --> 17:15.992
He has a pen in his throat!

17:16.868 --> 17:19.929
Michael! Oh, God, Michael! Are you...

17:19.972 --> 17:23.839
Is that a pen in his throat? Does
he have a ballpoint pen in his throat?

17:23.876 --> 17:26.276
- Let the doctors work.
- They have to be careful.

17:26.310 --> 17:29.439
Michael's been under stress,
and the last thing he needs...

17:29.481 --> 17:30.880
Can you handle this woman?

17:30.916 --> 17:33.646
We're gonna take you to your husband,
around the corner.

17:33.685 --> 17:36.245
Sweetheart, I'm here.
Michael, I'm here.

17:37.756 --> 17:40.054
- This is not her husband?
- Nope.

17:41.060 --> 17:43.688
- Oh, my God, Michael!
- It's her husband.

17:43.729 --> 17:45.629
- What happened to him?
- Come with me.

17:45.664 --> 17:47.859
- What happened to him?
- Please, please.

17:47.900 --> 17:51.859
You trached a man in the field
using a ballpoint pen?

17:51.904 --> 17:53.201
It was all I had on me.

17:53.238 --> 17:56.537
What? It's not like I didn't
clean it off with fresh snow.

17:56.575 --> 17:57.599
It's awesome.

17:57.643 --> 18:00.737
Really? You're going with
a size 6 shiley tube on that?

18:00.779 --> 18:02.371
Get this guy away from me.

18:02.414 --> 18:07.579
I'm gonna need a CT of his belly,
chief. Karev, get us some line.

18:07.619 --> 18:11.419
His trachea's crushed. Going to need
an OR and hands. Who's available?

18:11.457 --> 18:12.754
- Grey.
- The good Grey?

18:12.791 --> 18:15.885
- The intern Grey.
- And I'll throw in O'Malley.

18:15.928 --> 18:18.328
Oh. Nice. Perfect.

18:19.331 --> 18:23.461
Phil? Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. What happened?

18:25.938 --> 18:30.341
The limo hit a patch of ice.
Next thing I know,

18:30.375 --> 18:33.105
we're all upside down
and we're rolling and...

18:34.513 --> 18:38.244
- Anna, I can't feel my legs.
- Oh, my God.

18:38.283 --> 18:41.184
Oh, Phil, I'm so sorry.

18:41.220 --> 18:44.018
OK, get her out.
I gotta get a consult from Shepherd.

18:49.728 --> 18:52.697
Oh. Sir, Dr. Hahn's working
on multiple crush injuries.

18:52.731 --> 18:56.827
- Wants you to take a look.
- On my way. You're bleeding.

18:56.869 --> 19:01.499
My car was right behind theirs at
the intersection. I cut it on impact.

19:01.540 --> 19:03.371
And you triaged these men?

19:03.408 --> 19:07.572
Major Owen Hunt. US Army Second
Forward Surgical. I'm a trauma surgeon.

19:07.613 --> 19:12.778
- Just got home on leave.
- Yang, take care of Major Hunt's leg.

19:12.818 --> 19:16.720
- Sir... I'm scrubbing in with you...
- After you take care of Major Hunt.

19:18.891 --> 19:21.792
- Where are you going?
- To check on my other patients.

19:21.827 --> 19:23.055
No. You are the patient.

19:23.095 --> 19:25.689
Hello? Vincent?

19:25.731 --> 19:28.791
Are you there? Where am I?

19:28.834 --> 19:33.271
You've been in a car accident, Betty.
You're having a CT. It's gonna be OK.

19:33.305 --> 19:35.068
Everything is OK. Don't move.

19:35.107 --> 19:37.200
Some nutjob trached a guy with a pen.

19:37.242 --> 19:39.472
- Pretty cool.
- Want cool? Check this out.

19:39.511 --> 19:42.173
- Every 30 seconds.
- Is someone there?

19:42.214 --> 19:43.374
Where am I?

19:43.415 --> 19:47.818
You've been in a car accident, Betty.
You're having a CT. It's OK.

19:49.221 --> 19:52.486
Every 30 seconds her memory resets.
Every 30 seconds.

19:52.524 --> 19:56.551
Might not be bad. Like hitting the
refresh button, everything's new.

19:56.595 --> 19:58.222
How you doing?

19:58.263 --> 20:01.528
You keep asking me that
and I keep telling you I'm fine.

20:01.567 --> 20:03.330
I know, it's just...

20:03.368 --> 20:05.996
Sometimes I think Denny's
right around the corner,

20:06.038 --> 20:07.733
and he's been dead a long time.

20:07.773 --> 20:10.571
It just takes a while to get used to.

20:10.609 --> 20:13.169
Rebecca didn't die.
It's not like that for me.

20:13.212 --> 20:16.113
I'm good. But thank you for asking.

20:16.148 --> 20:18.275
Hello? Is someone there?

20:18.317 --> 20:19.716
Where am I?

20:20.385 --> 20:23.752
You're in a spaceship, you're
going to the Moon. Enjoy the ride.

20:23.789 --> 20:25.780
Alex.

20:27.926 --> 20:31.054
A spaceship? Excuse me?

20:31.096 --> 20:33.792
You're having a CT, Betty.
You're gonna be OK.

20:33.832 --> 20:36.460
You've been in a car accident.
Just don't move.

20:36.501 --> 20:40.028
- Thanks a lot.
- Bailey paged me. See you later.

20:42.241 --> 20:44.232
He has a depressed skull fracture.

20:44.276 --> 20:46.437
I could elevate the skull fragments,

20:46.478 --> 20:49.447
but there's no telling
how much damage has been done.

20:49.481 --> 20:52.609
- We're saving this man.
- We're looking at an aortic tear.

20:52.651 --> 20:54.551
Not to mention vast amounts of blood

20:54.586 --> 20:57.316
- in his abdomen...
- I can handle the bleeding.

20:57.356 --> 21:00.120
- He is circling the drain.
- I have other traumas.

21:00.158 --> 21:01.455
We're saving this man.

21:03.128 --> 21:06.291
Does everyone understand
or do I have to repeat myself?

21:06.331 --> 21:07.491
- Yes.
- Understood.

21:07.532 --> 21:09.898
Book OR Two.

21:12.804 --> 21:17.503
I know it's overwhelming,
but Phil couldn't be in better hands.

21:17.542 --> 21:19.908
It's not just Phil.

21:19.945 --> 21:22.038
It's also Michael.

21:23.382 --> 21:25.407
But you already knew that.

21:26.285 --> 21:28.082
I didn't know for sure...

21:28.120 --> 21:29.985
It's pathetic, isn't it?

21:30.022 --> 21:33.651
A married woman cheats on her
best friend with her husband.

21:33.692 --> 21:37.526
You can't go much lower than that.

21:37.562 --> 21:39.086
These things happen.

21:39.898 --> 21:42.093
I ran into Michael in the mall.

21:42.134 --> 21:47.265
We had lunch,
then a week later we had another lunch.

21:47.306 --> 21:52.039
And, here we are, eight months later.

21:52.077 --> 21:54.637
And Sarabeth has no idea.

21:54.680 --> 21:59.083
When you... When you spend your life
with someone and you have kids together

21:59.117 --> 22:02.086
you think it'll always be
this amazing and wonderful.

22:02.120 --> 22:05.248
You think that you'll
always feel that kind of love.

22:05.290 --> 22:09.784
And I do. I do love Phil.

22:09.828 --> 22:11.853
I just...

22:14.833 --> 22:16.323
Just what?

22:18.403 --> 22:22.305
Well, little pieces of you
get chipped away.

22:23.642 --> 22:29.080
By another person. And then you shave
little pieces of yourself away.

22:29.114 --> 22:31.105
So that you'll fit together.

22:32.484 --> 22:34.577
And one day you look up,

22:34.619 --> 22:37.713
and you don't even know who you are.

22:39.124 --> 22:41.285
I better get back to my husband.

22:41.326 --> 22:44.022
- He'll be wondering where I am.
- OK.

22:45.864 --> 22:51.097
- That graft is actually holding.
- I am impressing even myself.

22:51.136 --> 22:53.570
- Shep?
- Mm. Almost there.

22:53.605 --> 22:56.267
Everybody, take a look
at the monitor, please.

22:57.075 --> 23:00.875
Now, to elevate the last
of the skull fragments,

23:00.912 --> 23:03.972
I'll need a large, flat instrument
to get under the bone.

23:04.015 --> 23:06.176
Uh, curved number two penfield.

23:07.285 --> 23:10.550
You know what,
I want a number four penfield.

23:10.589 --> 23:14.753
Interesting. Why do you want to use
the number four penfield instead?

23:15.761 --> 23:17.092
Sorry?

23:17.129 --> 23:20.860
Oh. How would you explain it?
I'm observing your teaching style.

23:20.899 --> 23:24.096
- Hope you don't mind.
- Yeah, OK.

23:24.136 --> 23:26.604
So the penfield?
You changed it because?

23:26.638 --> 23:28.902
I changed my mind.

23:28.940 --> 23:30.635
Is there a problem, Rose?

23:30.675 --> 23:34.167
Not at all, Dr. Shepherd.
You changed your mind. Got it.

23:34.212 --> 23:36.077
Huh.

23:39.384 --> 23:42.751
Dr. Shepherd? I've got a guy
with a high level spinal injury.

23:42.788 --> 23:46.121
I've started him on steroids,
but he needs to be decompressed.

23:46.158 --> 23:48.718
- You almost done?
- Yeah. I'm done right now.

23:49.828 --> 23:51.523
Close up for me?

23:56.435 --> 24:00.496
So... we consider him
a good teacher, right?

24:00.539 --> 24:02.006
I'm just checking.

24:05.444 --> 24:08.538
The spine is crushed from C6 to T1,
impinging on the cord.

24:08.580 --> 24:11.777
We need to relieve the pressure
on the spinal cord.

24:11.817 --> 24:14.911
- But with these injuries...
- People don't walk again.

24:14.953 --> 24:19.549
- Phil. You don't know that.
- Anna, sweetheart, it's OK.

24:19.591 --> 24:21.115
You have to do something.

24:21.159 --> 24:26.426
Phil's very strong. He has grandkids.
You have to do something.

24:26.465 --> 24:28.865
- You could freeze him.
- Shouldn't be in here.

24:28.900 --> 24:31.733
If you want him to have
a shot at walking again.

24:35.841 --> 24:37.604
Who the hell are you?

24:37.642 --> 24:41.635
Army Surgeon Badass did something
crazy with a pen on a guy's throat.

24:41.680 --> 24:45.172
Appreciate it if you didn't give
my patient and wife false hope.

24:45.217 --> 24:48.243
Until you exhaust options,
it's not false. It's hope.

24:48.286 --> 24:50.584
You should keep
current on your research.

24:50.622 --> 24:53.591
They did make a football player
walk at Buffalo Gen

24:53.625 --> 24:55.388
using therapeutic hypothermia.

24:55.427 --> 24:58.726
Buffalo's patient was 20 years old,
in prime cardiac fitness.

24:58.763 --> 25:01.823
My patient is in his 60s
and is a very risky candidate.

25:01.867 --> 25:04.563
I'd prefer he live
to see his grandkids. Book an OR.

25:04.603 --> 25:08.471
Tell this patient this is not an option,
despite Uncle Sam's assessment.

25:10.509 --> 25:12.204
We're closing up your leg now.

25:28.059 --> 25:30.892
Michael can live
after they put a pen in his throat?

25:30.929 --> 25:33.591
The emergency trach helped him breathe.

25:33.632 --> 25:35.998
Dr. Sloan needs to
get him to the OR...

25:36.034 --> 25:38.127
Surgery? He needs surgery?

25:38.169 --> 25:41.570
When your husband
was pinned underneath the car

25:41.606 --> 25:44.040
he suffered
a laceration to his windpipe,

25:44.075 --> 25:47.135
which Dr. Sloan needs to fix
to stabilize his airway.

25:47.178 --> 25:52.707
He also has some bruising around
his kidney and a lac on his liver.

25:52.751 --> 25:54.685
Will he need surgery for that?

25:54.719 --> 25:58.815
There's a chance the abdominal
injuries will heal,

25:58.857 --> 26:02.293
but if they get worse,
yes, he will need surgery.

26:02.327 --> 26:06.058
Two surgeries?
I can't believe this is happening.

26:06.097 --> 26:08.964
- Hold on, this is today?
- Tonight. At midnight.

26:09.000 --> 26:12.026
- Ma'am, there's one other matter.
- More? There's more?

26:12.070 --> 26:15.267
According to billing,
your insurance expires at midnight.

26:15.307 --> 26:19.073
We're gonna treat you, of course,
but to make it easier on you later,

26:19.110 --> 26:21.908
is there another card,
or insurance policy?

26:21.947 --> 26:25.110
My husband,
he takes care of these things.

26:26.952 --> 26:28.317
OK.

26:33.625 --> 26:35.183
OK.

26:42.667 --> 26:44.658
I'm going to numb... Wow!

26:45.637 --> 26:47.935
- Uh, you're not numbed.
- So?

26:48.840 --> 26:51.866
So... Ow! Ow!

26:56.414 --> 26:58.575
Can't get an angle on these. Could you?

27:03.221 --> 27:04.711
OK...

27:17.736 --> 27:18.760
Thank you.

27:21.773 --> 27:23.263
Don't mention it.

27:23.842 --> 27:27.005
- Can I ask you something?
- Uh... What?

27:27.045 --> 27:29.605
Um, him, actually.

27:29.648 --> 27:34.517
Oh. Sure. I've got surgery.
And... poke yourself.

27:39.924 --> 27:42.620
Talk to me about the freezing thing.

27:42.661 --> 27:45.687
Betty Kenner, closed head injury
from the limo wreck.

27:47.799 --> 27:48.959
Subdural hematoma.

27:49.000 --> 27:50.661
- Why she has memory loss.
- Yep.

27:50.702 --> 27:53.330
Might ease up once we
relieve pressure. Book an OR.

27:53.371 --> 27:55.862
I'll go in on her after
I finish Anna's husband.

27:55.907 --> 27:56.999
Busy OR today.

27:57.042 --> 28:01.376
That's kinda your thing, right?
Juggling more than one person at a time?

28:07.619 --> 28:10.679
- Hey, how's Betty's husband?
- I'm scrubbing in on him now.

28:10.722 --> 28:13.953
Shepherd did what he could,
but the chief and Hahn are working.

28:13.992 --> 28:15.084
He's an ugly mess.

28:15.126 --> 28:18.493
Sarabeth's husband may need
another surgery once Derek's done.

28:18.530 --> 28:19.554
These poor women.

28:19.597 --> 28:22.998
Anna, the one with cuts,
is married to the guy on Derek's table.

28:23.034 --> 28:25.594
And she is sleeping
with Sarabeth's husband.

28:25.637 --> 28:27.696
- The one Sloan's working on.
- Kidding?

28:27.739 --> 28:30.674
- No, don't tell Betty.
- She wouldn't remember if I did.

28:30.709 --> 28:34.440
That happens? Married 40 years,
then become a big, fat, lying cheater?

28:34.479 --> 28:38.040
If 40 years doesn't make you committed,
what does? What's the point?

28:38.083 --> 28:40.779
- What if I move in with Derek...
- Give you 100 bucks

28:40.819 --> 28:42.582
if you talk about something else.

28:42.620 --> 28:46.078
It's not about the years, it's about
the man. Derek's a good man.

28:46.124 --> 28:49.218
- I'm out of here.
- There are a lot of really good men.

28:49.260 --> 28:51.785
George is a really good guy. I mean...

28:52.664 --> 28:54.859
Nope, Sloan's not.

28:54.899 --> 29:00.030
Alex. Yeah. Alex has turned
into a very good man.

29:01.539 --> 29:03.905
- You and Alex...?
- No!

29:03.942 --> 29:05.967
I'm making a point.

29:06.778 --> 29:10.145
But it is nice that we're friends.

29:10.181 --> 29:13.878
He's changed.
He's actually opening up to me.

29:13.918 --> 29:16.352
You think if you moved in
and got married,

29:16.387 --> 29:19.720
in 40 years, you'd feel dead inside?
Enough to cheat on him?

29:21.025 --> 29:22.253
Wow.

29:22.293 --> 29:25.160
Yang,
Major Hunt all taken care of?

29:25.196 --> 29:26.823
I did my best, sir.

29:26.865 --> 29:29.265
Put pressure
on this bleeder for me.

29:29.300 --> 29:32.963
You know what I think? I think
the number 12 ranking was a mistake.

29:33.004 --> 29:34.403
A clerical error.

29:34.439 --> 29:38.705
I'm gonna start making calls about it
as soon as I get out of this surgery.

29:38.743 --> 29:42.042
So, I've been observing teaching styles.

29:42.080 --> 29:45.311
Shepherd likes to teach
by thinking out loud,

29:45.350 --> 29:50.253
Bailey is blunt and direct
and doesn't overteach, and Sloan...

29:50.288 --> 29:52.848
Well, Sloan just likes
to berate and humiliate.

29:52.891 --> 29:55.587
If you really
wanna learn about teaching,

29:55.627 --> 29:59.495
you should talk to your students.
Find out how they learn best.

30:00.298 --> 30:01.424
Yang?

30:02.834 --> 30:06.531
- That's not necessary, sir...
- Are you serious or not, Dr. Hahn?

30:07.806 --> 30:09.239
Fine.

30:12.343 --> 30:13.401
Go.

30:15.680 --> 30:17.807
For me, personally,

30:17.849 --> 30:20.147
I learn better when I'm asked questions,

30:20.185 --> 30:21.447
the Socratic method.

30:21.486 --> 30:25.149
That's the cornerstone of medical
teaching. It's what we do in rounds.

30:25.190 --> 30:28.523
Not everyone does it.
Some people simply tell you what to do.

30:28.560 --> 30:30.790
Who? Are you talking about me?

30:30.829 --> 30:32.524
It's OK, Dr. Yang.

30:32.564 --> 30:35.931
Dr. Hahn is eager to learn.
You can be honest.

30:40.038 --> 30:42.632
He's crashing.
Get me an aortic clamp.

30:42.674 --> 30:44.767
I can't get
a handle on this bleeding.

30:44.809 --> 30:47.437
We may have to start doing
damage control soon.

30:54.419 --> 30:57.286
I see
a tear in the renal artery.

30:57.322 --> 30:59.984
You familiar with single
layer continuous closure?

31:00.024 --> 31:02.049
- Of course.
- BP's still dropping.

31:02.093 --> 31:04.357
Max out on levophed,
keep pushing the blood.

31:05.763 --> 31:07.663
Get in there and stitch, Yang.

31:10.134 --> 31:12.261
There's a problem with the insurance.

31:12.303 --> 31:14.999
As we explained,
he can't talk right now.

31:15.039 --> 31:18.008
I know but, Michael,
I called them.

31:18.042 --> 31:21.136
And the credit card company.
And they said that...

31:22.680 --> 31:28.050
The cards have been cancelled.
I... I don't understand.

31:28.887 --> 31:33.654
I just need to know what to do.
I don't know what to do.

31:34.659 --> 31:38.527
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry,
but we need to get him to Dr. Sloan now.

31:56.881 --> 31:58.872
Is there something I can do?

32:00.351 --> 32:03.286
Someone I can call? I...

32:04.689 --> 32:06.281
I don't...

32:06.324 --> 32:08.588
I don't handle the money, but...

32:08.626 --> 32:13.154
If you can just tell me who to call.

32:15.667 --> 32:18.261
I'll talk to billing,
see what I can do.

32:20.638 --> 32:22.629
Thank you.

32:32.684 --> 32:36.415
It's stuck. Can't seem
to get it down the left bronchis.

32:36.454 --> 32:40.254
- You almost got it, George.
- What are you, his little cheerleader?

32:40.291 --> 32:43.522
Step aside, wonder boy,
before you make things worse.

32:43.561 --> 32:45.995
O'Malley, go find out if the OR's ready.

32:46.030 --> 32:47.827
If you can manage that.

32:52.804 --> 32:56.262
You're a little mean to George.
Unnecessarily mean.

32:56.307 --> 32:59.799
He's studying to retake his intern test,
so he's stressed out.

32:59.844 --> 33:02.938
So I was just thinking
maybe you could be nicer.

33:02.981 --> 33:05.279
You're an intern.
Why are you talking to me?

33:07.018 --> 33:12.046
You're... You're my half sister's
boyfriend's best friend. So I...

33:12.090 --> 33:14.115
You thought that makes us friends?

33:14.158 --> 33:17.355
Thought you'd defend your
boyfriend to me and I'd take it?

33:17.395 --> 33:20.387
- He's not my boyfriend.
- But you want him to be.

33:20.431 --> 33:21.728
- Do not.
- Do too.

33:21.766 --> 33:24.030
- Do not.
- Do too. Does he know?

33:24.068 --> 33:25.831
- Shut up.
- I'm your attending.

33:25.870 --> 33:28.771
Can't tell me to shut up.
Want me to be nicer to O'Malley?

33:28.806 --> 33:30.433
- Please?
- Confess your love,

33:30.475 --> 33:32.773
- I'll think about it.
- Shut up.

33:33.945 --> 33:36.072
<i>Dr. Leone, call the blood bank.</i>

33:37.782 --> 33:40.910
- Know anything about health insurance?
- No. Why?

33:40.952 --> 33:43.147
Trying to help out a patient.

33:43.187 --> 33:46.623
The softer side of Alex.
Izzie was right.

33:48.292 --> 33:50.760
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Nothing.

33:50.795 --> 33:52.194
What did Izzie say to you?

33:53.731 --> 33:59.499
She said you were a good man.
She said you'd changed. It was nothing.

33:59.537 --> 34:02.938
Did she say that I cried?
Because that is a lie.

34:02.974 --> 34:05.772
- She didn't say that.
- Should keep her mouth shut.

34:05.810 --> 34:08.710
Alex, I made a stupid joke.
She didn't mean anything.

34:11.616 --> 34:13.379
Yang, how you doing?

34:13.418 --> 34:16.512
It's, um... I can't get it,
it's not holding.

34:16.554 --> 34:18.851
- It's tearing.
- Damn it. Move.

34:18.889 --> 34:21.154
I thought you said
you've done the stitch.

34:21.192 --> 34:23.284
- I have! A hundred times.
- On hearts.

34:23.327 --> 34:24.351
On hearts.

34:24.395 --> 34:28.956
Your forceps were macerating the tissue.
You were handling the bowel incorrectly.

34:29.000 --> 34:33.402
Which you would know if you weren't
allowed to clock so many hours in

34:33.438 --> 34:37.568
cardiothoracics at the expense
of your general surgery knowledge.

34:46.117 --> 34:48.880
Crap. His vocal cords
are damaged beyond repair.

34:48.920 --> 34:51.616
- Is there anything we can do?
- Probably won't talk again.

34:51.656 --> 34:54.681
- I think that question was for me.
- Sorry.

34:54.725 --> 34:58.491
You get to take your intern test again,
think that makes you big man on campus?

34:58.529 --> 35:00.929
Doesn't change the fact
you failed the first time.

35:00.965 --> 35:02.830
- Dr. Sloan.
- I'm sorry, Grey.

35:02.867 --> 35:05.427
Was there something
you wanted to say to anyone?

35:05.470 --> 35:06.630
No. There wasn't.

35:06.671 --> 35:08.263
- Coward.
- Shut up.

35:08.306 --> 35:10.137
Lexie!

35:10.174 --> 35:11.505
Pressure's dropping.

35:11.542 --> 35:14.170
It looks like defib.

35:14.212 --> 35:17.045
- Twenty joules.
- Clear!

35:20.318 --> 35:23.617
Hang another unit of packed cells.
As many as it takes.

35:24.622 --> 35:28.718
Somebody go get some FFP!
Suction, please. Suction!

35:28.759 --> 35:32.320
I got it. This is too much blood,
too much blood...

35:33.664 --> 35:35.256
We're losing him.

35:37.034 --> 35:39.730
What's going on?

35:39.770 --> 35:41.601
Am I in a hospital?

35:41.639 --> 35:46.303
There was an accident,
but you're going to be fine.

35:56.721 --> 35:58.746
We're all going to be fine.

36:16.107 --> 36:17.597
Yeah... Um...

36:18.242 --> 36:21.405
I was able to repair
your husband's vertebrae,

36:21.445 --> 36:24.278
and relieve the pressure
from his spine, but, uh...

36:26.250 --> 36:28.980
- He's still paralyzed?
- Yes, I'm sorry.

36:29.020 --> 36:32.046
Oh, God... Oh, Phil.

36:33.758 --> 36:36.158
And Michael? What about Michael?

36:36.194 --> 36:40.494
I repaired his trachea, but
unfortunately, his vocal cords

36:40.531 --> 36:42.726
were completely severed in the accident.

36:42.767 --> 36:46.897
He can't talk?
He'll never be able to talk?

36:46.938 --> 36:48.963
We have to be strong.

36:50.241 --> 36:53.870
We have to be strong
for Phil and for Michael.

36:54.712 --> 36:57.977
I'll be ready for Betty in OR One
when you're done here.

37:00.718 --> 37:05.178
- Um...
- Is it Vincent? What's happened?

37:05.223 --> 37:07.589
- Please.
- Came through surgery.

37:07.625 --> 37:09.718
He's stable, but still critical.

37:09.760 --> 37:12.320
- Oh, my God.
- This is Dr. Yang.

37:13.831 --> 37:16.391
She is going to be responsible
for seeing to it

37:16.434 --> 37:19.096
that your husband
makes it through the night.

37:19.136 --> 37:20.160
I'm...

37:22.173 --> 37:23.834
I will keep you posted.

37:25.710 --> 37:28.679
Keep me posted... about what?

37:30.514 --> 37:33.915
Where am I?
Where's Vincent?

37:33.951 --> 37:37.409
She has a subdural hematoma.
Her memory resets every 30 seconds.

37:40.057 --> 37:41.456
Perfect.

37:50.034 --> 37:51.524
Rose...

37:53.638 --> 37:55.037
Please look at me.

37:55.773 --> 37:58.833
If you're gonna behave like this,
you can't be in my OR.

38:03.581 --> 38:06.141
OK, there's no good way to say this...

38:07.084 --> 38:09.917
I've been acting this way because I'm...

38:11.656 --> 38:13.681
I'm carrying your child, Derek.

38:17.695 --> 38:20.129
Ha! Gotcha.

38:23.734 --> 38:26.897
- This is your idea of a joke?
- Oh, please, you deserve it.

38:26.937 --> 38:28.404
Who do you think you are?

38:28.439 --> 38:31.931
"If you're gonna keep behaving
this way, you can't be in my OR."

38:31.976 --> 38:34.444
You should transfer
to a different specialty.

38:34.945 --> 38:37.709
You should transfer
to a different specialty.

38:39.183 --> 38:42.516
- I'm a neurosurgeon.
- You should've thought of that

38:42.553 --> 38:45.716
while repeatedly assuring me
that you were over your ex.

38:45.756 --> 38:49.123
See you in the OR.
I'm not going anywhere.

38:55.866 --> 38:57.993
Chief, about Phillip Loomis?

38:58.035 --> 39:00.026
Shepherd's spinal patient?

39:00.071 --> 39:05.634
I was thinking,
what about therapeutic hypothermia?

39:05.676 --> 39:08.975
You want to freeze a spinal injury?

39:09.013 --> 39:13.143
They did it in Buffalo,
and Mass Gen had success with it too.

39:13.184 --> 39:17.143
- And Major Hunt, he swears by it.
- What does Shepherd think?

39:17.822 --> 39:20.985
He thinks it's too risky
in Mr. Loomis' case.

39:21.025 --> 39:25.587
- He's not as fit, he's older...
- Loomis isn't much older than me.

39:27.431 --> 39:30.764
I can do the procedure, chief,
I just need your OK.

39:32.203 --> 39:35.468
- What were you doing back there?
- I was trying to help you.

39:35.506 --> 39:38.942
Telling an attending to shut up
in his OR? That's not helping.

39:38.976 --> 39:42.275
What makes you think you can...?
You're sleeping with him?

39:42.313 --> 39:44.213
- What? No!
- Yes, you are!

39:44.248 --> 39:46.182
Why would you say that? Jealous?

39:46.217 --> 39:49.675
Of the fact that you can
tell Sloan to shut up? Yeah.

39:49.720 --> 39:53.121
You know, he's right.
I'm the hospital joke, it's my fault.

39:53.157 --> 39:55.557
I'm the one who failed my intern exam,

39:55.593 --> 39:58.858
and got married in Vegas
and cheated on my wife.

39:58.896 --> 40:01.592
You don't understand.
The only reason he was...

40:01.632 --> 40:04.032
Doesn't matter,
I can take care of myself.

40:06.070 --> 40:09.631
He's got fishing gear
and boots and hair products.

40:09.673 --> 40:13.404
I don't have room for that stuff.
He talks. And not a little. He chats.

40:13.444 --> 40:16.004
- He's chatty freaking Cathy.
- Not right now.

40:16.046 --> 40:19.277
You know what's gonna happen
after he moves in, don't you?

40:19.316 --> 40:22.808
We build a house on his land,
our land, because we'll be married.

40:22.853 --> 40:26.311
And then I'll be Dr. Mrs. Shepherd.

40:28.292 --> 40:32.524
And you know what comes after that?
Babies. There'll be his babies.

40:32.563 --> 40:35.532
So they'll have perfect hair,
and they'll be chatty.

40:35.566 --> 40:38.262
I'll have five chatty children,
a chatty husband

40:38.302 --> 40:42.466
and live in a house in the wilderness.
Then start sleeping with your husband.

40:42.506 --> 40:45.270
Gotta tell him I changed my mind,
don't you think?

40:45.309 --> 40:47.038
- Meredith!
- It's...

40:47.077 --> 40:48.374
What?

40:50.514 --> 40:53.210
- Why are you making that face?
- Shut up!

40:53.250 --> 40:56.742
Just shut up about Derek.
Shut up about moving in with Derek.

40:56.787 --> 41:00.382
Shut up about your relationship!
Because I've heard it all before.

41:00.424 --> 41:02.984
You guys get together,
I have to listen to it.

41:03.027 --> 41:05.018
You break up, I have to listen to it.

41:05.863 --> 41:08.457
I almost killed a man in surgery today.

41:09.700 --> 41:13.192
OK, you wanna know what I think?
OK, you really wanna know?

41:13.237 --> 41:15.671
You and Derek will not work.

41:15.706 --> 41:19.267
Moving in together is
a mistake of massive proportions.

41:19.310 --> 41:23.406
You are dreaming of dead Derek,
which should tell you it will not work.

41:23.848 --> 41:27.841
- Cristina...
- No. This "happily ever after?"

41:27.885 --> 41:29.409
Does not exist.

41:29.453 --> 41:33.617
So please, please, please,
as you weigh your options here,

41:33.657 --> 41:37.093
just consider the possibility
of shutting the hell up.

41:37.127 --> 41:39.425
Because I can't listen to it anymore.

41:39.463 --> 41:40.725
- I...
- No!

41:40.764 --> 41:41.788
- OK.
- No!

41:41.832 --> 41:44.062
- I...
- That's it, that's it. I'm done.

41:45.503 --> 41:48.563
Ah! Oh! Ow! Ow!

41:51.675 --> 41:54.974
I'm not gonna say you deserved that,
but you deserved that.

41:55.012 --> 41:58.345
Thanks.
Help me... Help me up.

42:09.927 --> 42:11.895
Don't move. I'm gonna go get some help.
