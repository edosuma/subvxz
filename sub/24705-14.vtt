00:21.285 --> 00:23.219
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

00:23.287 --> 00:25.949
- Mr. Wagner?
- Yes, right this way.

00:31.328 --> 00:35.059
Morning, Detective.
Susan's out.

00:35.132 --> 00:37.726
Well, actually
I'm here to see you.

00:37.801 --> 00:40.793
I wanted you to know I wouldn't
be working for you anymore.

00:40.871 --> 00:45.103
I'm sorry to hear that. It looked
like you and Susan were getting along.

00:45.175 --> 00:47.973
- Scheduling problems?
- Not really.

00:48.045 --> 00:51.742
- I just don't want to take your money.
- Why's that?

00:51.815 --> 00:56.252
This way, if you keep beating her up,
I can do something about it.

00:56.320 --> 00:58.584
You working for her now?

00:58.656 --> 01:00.647
Mmm, nah.
Just the police department.

01:00.724 --> 01:03.124
Then maybe you'll consider
that this situation's...

01:03.193 --> 01:06.651
a little more complicated than
you've been led to understand.

01:08.265 --> 01:12.201
Nothing complicated about
those bruises on your wife's face.

01:12.269 --> 01:15.534
You are beyond your depth,
Detective Kelly.

01:15.606 --> 01:17.540
Our conversation is over.

01:17.608 --> 01:19.542
I'm done too.

01:19.610 --> 01:22.807
Just to let you know
that if you hit her again,

01:22.880 --> 01:25.815
you're going to be sorry
you ever met me.

03:14.765 --> 03:17.290
- Detective.
- What ho.

03:17.368 --> 03:20.030
- What ho.
- What's going on in there?

03:20.104 --> 03:22.038
Ah, Walker just caught a case.

03:22.106 --> 03:25.542
Now he's voicing some reservations to
the lieutenant about me workin' backup.

03:25.609 --> 03:28.271
- This is gonna take some time, Andy.
- Come on, John.

03:28.345 --> 03:30.370
Please, I understand my situation.

03:30.448 --> 03:33.975
I spent a long time being sauced.
I need to win back my colleagues' trust.

03:34.051 --> 03:37.612
I've got to exhibit
a continuous positive approach,

03:37.688 --> 03:39.622
even with this dim bulb here.

03:39.690 --> 03:43.353
Sipowicz, Kelly,
robbery, double homicide.

03:43.427 --> 03:46.260
Liquor store over onJames Street.
You guys wanna give me a hand?

03:46.330 --> 03:49.197
- Yeah, sure. Gimme.
- Our pleasure.

03:49.266 --> 03:52.394
Uh, here's the address.
I'll see you over there.

03:55.539 --> 03:58.133
That was positive, wasn't it?
Our pleasure."

03:58.209 --> 04:00.074
Fair.

04:00.144 --> 04:03.636
What should I have said?
Our pleasure, rooty-toot-toot"?

04:08.686 --> 04:12.486
- Can I talk to you for a minute?
- Yeah.

04:12.556 --> 04:15.684
- I'll see you outside, all right?
- Yeah, sure.

04:18.329 --> 04:20.262
Catch you later, Ted.

04:20.331 --> 04:23.300
- Did you go to your dad's service?
- Yeah, I just got back.

04:23.367 --> 04:25.597
- How'd your mother hold up?
- Okay.

04:25.669 --> 04:27.102
Yeah.

04:27.171 --> 04:30.140
I wanted to thank you for being there
for me the other night.

04:30.207 --> 04:33.506
- Aw, it's all right.
- I don't want it to be over for us.

04:33.577 --> 04:35.511
This is not the place
to talk about it.

04:35.579 --> 04:39.037
- It's not like you let me pick my spots.
- Okay.

04:39.116 --> 04:42.142
I admit I have feelings for you,
but it's not gonna work out for us.

04:42.219 --> 04:43.914
I'm not gonna take that.
We can make it work out.

04:43.988 --> 04:45.785
I gotta go, all right?

04:56.267 --> 04:59.361
I'd just walked into the store
behind these other two guys.

04:59.436 --> 05:02.963
And this guy, he comes out
from the back room with a gun.

05:03.040 --> 05:06.373
He made us all come over to this
aisle here and lie on our stomachs.

05:06.443 --> 05:09.310
- Did you get a look at him?
- Yeah, pretty good.

05:09.380 --> 05:13.009
He was a white guy,
tall, about 50 years old.

05:13.083 --> 05:17.179
He had on like a black trench coat,
down below his knees.

05:17.254 --> 05:21.520
He was like six-three,
six-four. Good sized.

05:21.592 --> 05:24.425
Any marks you noticed on his face
or hands? Any facial hairs?

05:24.495 --> 05:28.955
Yeah, he had a mustache, and he
smelled like he'd been drinking.

05:29.033 --> 05:32.434
He came and stood over us,
and that's when I heard the click...

05:32.503 --> 05:34.095
- from the gun over my head.
- Kelly.

05:34.171 --> 05:35.440
Thank God he must've used
up all the bullets...

05:36.441 --> 05:39.410
White, 45 or so,
around six feet tall?

05:39.477 --> 05:41.843
All right, let's get these
people over to the precinct.

05:41.913 --> 05:45.007
Have them take a look
at some pictures.

05:45.083 --> 05:48.018
My guy makes the perp
about six-three or four,

05:48.086 --> 05:50.020
50 years old, a mustache.

05:50.088 --> 05:52.022
Let's get 'em over
to the precinct.

05:52.090 --> 05:54.024
Here's licenses from
the cars parked outside.

05:54.092 --> 05:55.184
Okay.

05:55.259 --> 05:57.693
Hey, Walker, we don't have to
hold hands, but would you mind...

05:57.762 --> 06:00.253
not talking to me
like I'm Timmy, the laundry boy?

06:00.331 --> 06:03.061
You give me the license numbers
for the canvass. I said okay.

06:03.134 --> 06:06.297
All right. Okay, fine.
It's my mistake. All right?

06:06.371 --> 06:08.635
You got a minute, Kelly?

06:11.943 --> 06:15.640
Look, this is notice. I'm not taking
any crap from your fat friend.

06:15.713 --> 06:18.910
- Give him a square shot.
- I'll give him the shot he earns.

06:18.983 --> 06:21.474
But I'm telling you,
if that drunk screws up my case...

06:21.552 --> 06:24.988
You're not paying attention. He hasn't
had a drink in over two months.

06:25.056 --> 06:27.991
So why don't you take your attitude
and shove it up your ass?

06:28.059 --> 06:30.527
Is this something the whole class
can appreciate?

06:30.595 --> 06:32.529
We're done.

06:32.597 --> 06:37.034
Folks, let's take a ride to the precinct
house, try and make a photo I.D.

06:43.074 --> 06:45.565
- Hey, Detective.
- Hey.

06:45.643 --> 06:50.012
See me on your way out.
Don't stop till you die.

06:50.081 --> 06:52.914
Okay, we'll take you upstairs
and show you some pictures.

06:52.984 --> 06:55.282
- See if you can identify anyone.
- Yeah, all right.

06:55.353 --> 06:57.685
Mrs. Wagner.

06:57.755 --> 06:59.689
What's happening?

06:59.757 --> 07:02.089
My husband told me you won't
be working for us anymore.

07:02.160 --> 07:04.856
Yeah, that's right.

07:04.929 --> 07:07.454
Uh... how's the eye?

07:07.532 --> 07:10.695
It's fine.
Please don't quit, Mr. Kelly.

07:10.768 --> 07:14.295
Mrs. Wagner, you don't need a bodyguard
for when you go out in public.

07:14.372 --> 07:16.602
Your problem is
a domestic situation.

07:16.674 --> 07:19.199
My advice is if your husband
hits you again,

07:19.277 --> 07:23.145
just file a criminal complaint
or move out on him.

07:23.214 --> 07:26.445
What you shouldn't do is stay
in that big apartment and take it...

07:26.517 --> 07:28.985
or talk the way you were
the other night,

07:29.053 --> 07:32.716
which sounded like you were
soliciting me to commit a crime.

07:32.790 --> 07:35.725
When I said that I wished something
would happen to him, I was upset.

07:35.793 --> 07:38.728
- I didn't mean anything by it.
- Okay, maybe I misunderstood.

07:38.796 --> 07:41.321
But, Mrs. Wagner, a lot of women
that have husbands like yours...

07:41.399 --> 07:43.663
can't do anything
to help themselves.

07:43.734 --> 07:46.726
You can.
You can make a choice. Do it.

07:46.804 --> 07:49.932
You're indulging a prejudice,
Mr. Kelly.

07:51.209 --> 07:53.609
Affluence doesn't always
purchase opportunity.

08:03.421 --> 08:05.787
Take a look at these.

08:11.028 --> 08:13.292
- Hey, Sipowicz.
- What?

08:16.434 --> 08:18.561
My witness just I.D.'d this guy.

08:18.636 --> 08:21.799
He's got two priors for armed robbery.
Show him to your people.

08:21.873 --> 08:25.775
- Hey, wait. This guy's five-nine.
- So what?

08:25.843 --> 08:28.141
Our statements made the perp
at six-three or four.

08:28.212 --> 08:30.146
Mine said around six.

08:30.214 --> 08:32.977
Sipowicz, people look taller
when you're Iying on the ground.

08:33.049 --> 08:34.984
Show 'em the photograph.

08:38.990 --> 08:40.924
New faces.

08:43.059 --> 08:44.493
No.

08:44.562 --> 08:46.496
Take your time.
This doesn't have to be fast.

08:46.564 --> 08:48.555
- Look at these carefully.
- We got plenty more pictures.

08:48.633 --> 08:51.796
- No, I don't recognize anybody.
- No!

08:51.869 --> 08:53.803
Kelly.

08:55.573 --> 08:58.508
I got a positive I.D.
From one witness.

08:58.576 --> 09:01.602
The guy's name is Coleman. He's got
the right priors. I want to pick him up.

09:01.679 --> 09:04.273
- Sipowicz thinks he may be too short.
- No, no, no, no.

09:04.348 --> 09:07.613
Let's pick him up.
Maybe he was wearin' lifts.

09:16.861 --> 09:19.762
Yeah, Bensonhurst, John.
It's a likely locale, huh?

09:19.830 --> 09:22.628
Guy lives here, wants to rob
a liquor store in downtown Manhattan.

09:22.700 --> 09:25.294
All he's gotta do is make like,
what, nine, ten subway transfers?

09:25.369 --> 09:28.702
Maybe he had business downtown
and came back and did the store then.

09:28.773 --> 09:31.742
Yeah, right. Maybe his doctor's
down on James Street, huh?

09:31.809 --> 09:34.972
One that gives him hormone injections
that pump him up to six-three...

09:35.046 --> 09:36.980
when he's about to pull a job...

09:37.048 --> 09:40.540
and then shrink him down to his normal
five-nine right afterward, huh?

09:40.618 --> 09:44.486
So what's goin' on
with you and that girl?

09:46.223 --> 09:47.986
Which girl?

09:48.059 --> 09:50.653
The one we haven't been
talkin' about. Licalsi.

09:50.728 --> 09:53.822
- Nothing's goin' on.
- Hey, you're a divorced man, John.

09:53.898 --> 09:55.331
It's a healthy urge.

09:55.399 --> 09:57.890
If she worked at a topless bar,
I'd take a shot at her myself.

09:57.969 --> 10:00.437
Nothing is going on,
and here's the guy, Andy.

10:00.504 --> 10:02.438
All right,
let's take the bastard.

10:02.506 --> 10:05.737
If he didn't do the liquor store,
maybe he did something else.

10:07.645 --> 10:10.011
Oh, look at this, John.
Where's his mustache, huh?

10:10.081 --> 10:12.709
- Our witness said he had a mustache.
- People shave.

10:12.783 --> 10:15.183
- Police officers. You Howard Coleman?
- Yeah.

10:15.252 --> 10:17.652
We need to talk to you about
your activities this morning.

10:17.722 --> 10:19.349
I didn't have any activities.

10:19.423 --> 10:21.687
I went to the drugstore.
That's the first I went out.

10:21.759 --> 10:24.592
You were seen on James Street
this morning in Manhattan.

10:24.662 --> 10:26.596
I wasn't there.
You get off my property.

10:26.664 --> 10:28.427
We're gonna have to
take you in for questioning.

10:28.499 --> 10:30.433
You better have a warrant
or get away from me!

10:30.501 --> 10:33.061
Don't make this any tougher
than it has to be.

10:33.137 --> 10:35.765
- Daddy, what's the matter?
- Go back inside. Take your medicine.

10:35.840 --> 10:37.933
- Come on!
- Hey! Hey, hey!

10:38.009 --> 10:40.409
- Daddy!
- Take it easy.

10:40.478 --> 10:43.572
- Stop it! You're hurting him!
- Nobody's gonna get hurt.

10:43.648 --> 10:46.344
- Now you're under arrest!
- Take it easy.

10:46.417 --> 10:49.614
- Daddy? Daddy!
- It's all right.

10:49.687 --> 10:54.317
Sure acts innocent, doesn't he?

10:59.030 --> 11:01.328
You didn't rob any liquor store,
right, Coleman?

11:01.399 --> 11:03.799
You always carry 850 bucks
around in your pocket.

11:03.868 --> 11:06.735
- Where'd you get that money?
- I bet a horse yesterday.

11:06.804 --> 11:09.932
- Which horse? What race was he in?
- Some horse at Aqueduct.

11:10.007 --> 11:11.941
I don't remember the name.

11:12.009 --> 11:14.671
No one's saying you went in that store
to do murder. Now, what happened there?

11:14.745 --> 11:17.236
Taking the place off, and someone
tried to get violent with you?

11:17.314 --> 11:19.407
- What's your name again?
- Detective Walker.

11:19.483 --> 11:21.474
Detective Walker, I was never near
any liquor store onJames Street today.

11:21.552 --> 11:25.147
I wasn't in Manhattan,
so why don't you kiss my ass?

11:25.222 --> 11:27.087
What if I give you
a broken jaw, huh?

11:27.158 --> 11:29.626
You better make sure these guys
are holding me down.

11:29.694 --> 11:31.787
Here we go.
That's it, Walker. Come on.

11:31.862 --> 11:36.094
- There you go.
- Hey, what's wrong with your daughter?

11:36.167 --> 11:39.659
- What do you mean?
- You told her to take some medicine.

11:39.737 --> 11:41.898
It's for her breathing.
She's got asthma.

11:41.972 --> 11:43.837
Yeah? I had a kid had that.

11:43.908 --> 11:47.571
So what's that supposed to do,
make me love you?

11:47.645 --> 11:51.911
I was hoping you'd get some deep,
warm feelings for me, yeah.

11:51.982 --> 11:53.916
All right, let's get back
to the money.

11:53.984 --> 11:57.784
Your ex-wife's here
to see you, Detective.

11:59.123 --> 12:01.057
- Uh, thanks.
- Sure.

12:12.136 --> 12:14.070
Hi.

12:18.008 --> 12:20.169
I just quit my job.

12:21.746 --> 12:23.680
What brought that about?

12:25.249 --> 12:28.741
Those creeps had me in for
a cards on the table" conversation.

12:28.819 --> 12:32.812
We need you to be more forthcoming
about your previous work for the city.

12:32.890 --> 12:35.620
We need to know their approach on
our clients' variance applications.

12:35.693 --> 12:37.627
How do they stand
on Picheon and Dean?"

12:37.695 --> 12:39.629
Excuse me," I ask.

12:39.697 --> 12:42.257
I guess that stuff when I came here,
how it was me you were interested in...

12:42.333 --> 12:45.359
and not my contacts from my previous
employment, all that was a crock?"

12:45.436 --> 12:48.200
Let's be adults, Laura."

12:48.272 --> 12:51.503
So I told them they could
stick their job up their ass.

12:51.575 --> 12:53.975
Just your way
of giving notice, huh?

12:56.514 --> 12:59.244
You're not gonna say, I told you so"?

12:59.316 --> 13:01.978
No. Not the type.

13:11.662 --> 13:15.154
- You got plans for dinner?
- You buying?

13:15.232 --> 13:18.201
Pick you up
in a couple of hours.

13:18.269 --> 13:20.601
I'm gonna be truthful
with you, Mr. Schauffner.

13:20.671 --> 13:23.003
The way these lineups work,
you're not gonna help me any...

13:23.073 --> 13:25.906
if you say, That could be him"
or Maybe that's the guy."

13:25.976 --> 13:29.673
You gotta say, That's him.
I recognize him. That's the guy."

13:29.747 --> 13:32.238
- You follow?
- I understand.

13:32.316 --> 13:34.341
'Course, I'm saying,
if you recognize him.

13:34.418 --> 13:36.352
Don't say you recognize him
if you don't.

13:36.420 --> 13:37.614
Right.

13:37.688 --> 13:40.020
Now you know what I need,
so we can get started here.

13:40.090 --> 13:42.024
Kelly. It's lineup time.

13:42.092 --> 13:45.186
Walker just finished touching up
the bull's-eye on Coleman's forehead.

13:45.262 --> 13:47.628
All right, come on. Here.

13:47.698 --> 13:50.531
Take a look.

13:51.869 --> 13:53.860
Take your time.

13:55.472 --> 13:58.202
- I see him.
- Which one?

13:59.443 --> 14:01.968
Number three.

14:02.046 --> 14:04.037
Are you sure?

14:04.114 --> 14:06.275
Yeah, I'm sure. That's the guy.

14:06.350 --> 14:08.284
I recognize him.

14:10.721 --> 14:12.985
I like the guy real good, Lieutenant.

14:13.057 --> 14:15.924
He did two bits for armed robbery.
We got a positive-witness I.D.

14:15.993 --> 14:18.655
Plus, when we pinched him,
he had 850 bucks in his pocket...

14:18.729 --> 14:21.323
he couldn't
satisfactorily explain.

14:21.398 --> 14:24.834
- What do you think?
- Looks good so far.

14:24.902 --> 14:28.668
We'll want to see if Crime Scene
lifts prints from that liquor store,

14:28.739 --> 14:31.333
but, you know, like he says.

14:31.408 --> 14:33.933
Work it up,
give it to the D.A.

14:35.412 --> 14:38.575
Lieutenant Fancy.

14:38.649 --> 14:41.584
Yeah, I got a copy of the report.
Yeah, I read it.

14:41.652 --> 14:43.586
Well, in the future,
you can assume...

14:46.490 --> 14:48.424
- Thanks for the help.
- Yeah.

14:48.492 --> 14:50.687
I didn't mean to be
so irritable all day.

14:50.761 --> 14:52.695
- No problem.
- You son of a bitch!

14:52.763 --> 14:55.630
- Why are you doing this to me?
- Let's get you to the court.

14:55.699 --> 14:58.668
- I gotta call my daughter.
- Call her from the tombs.

14:58.736 --> 15:01.705
- I'm tellin' you, he didn't do it.
- Let it unwind, Andy.

15:01.772 --> 15:06.471
- We'll stay on it.
- Meanwhile, Coleman eats prison food.

15:08.445 --> 15:12.040
4B. How's it goin'?

15:12.116 --> 15:15.313
Fine, Detective.
Do you have a, uh, a moment for me?

15:15.386 --> 15:17.479
- Yeah, come on.
- Several matters.

15:17.554 --> 15:20.489
First, needless to say,
our tenants' readiness group...

15:20.557 --> 15:22.821
is eager to hear your thoughts
tomorrow evening...

15:22.893 --> 15:25.487
both on the building security
and personal safety measures.

15:25.562 --> 15:28.656
Is there anything I can do
by way of advance preparation?

15:28.732 --> 15:31.826
Will you have visual aids and the like
I can help to set up?

15:31.902 --> 15:34.336
No, no visual aids.
I'll just be talkin' for a while.

15:34.405 --> 15:36.999
Fine. I've arranged for
some refreshments and the like.

15:37.074 --> 15:40.202
The other thing, Detective,
concerns...

15:40.277 --> 15:43.838
the upcoming fifth anniversary
of my college graduation.

15:43.914 --> 15:47.008
The alumni magazine has asked
each member of my class...

15:47.084 --> 15:50.076
to write a brief account of what's
become of them in the intervening years.

15:50.154 --> 15:53.612
And I find, surprisingly,
looking back, you know,

15:53.691 --> 15:56.023
leaving home and moving
to New York and so forth,

15:56.093 --> 15:59.187
that this incident
of getting robbed and beaten up...

15:59.263 --> 16:01.390
and then dealing
with the man subsequently,

16:01.465 --> 16:04.628
in a way taking back
my citizenship,

16:04.702 --> 16:06.966
that whole experience has been
very formative for me.

16:07.037 --> 16:09.631
I wonder if I can access
your police reports...

16:09.707 --> 16:11.937
so I could write
the experience up.

16:12.009 --> 16:14.876
- No.
- No?

16:14.945 --> 16:18.039
I couldn't release them informally.
You'd have to fill out an application.

16:18.115 --> 16:19.810
That would take a...

16:19.883 --> 16:22.613
I really feel that those reports
would be useful to me.

16:22.686 --> 16:24.916
4B, why don't you...

16:24.989 --> 16:27.924
Why don't you concentrate on your
career highlights, your accomplishments?

16:27.992 --> 16:31.359
Send that in to your yearbook. Why write
about a punk who tried to rob ya?

16:31.428 --> 16:33.555
Because it's important to me.

16:33.630 --> 16:36.565
I think you're getting
tied up in knots about this.

16:36.633 --> 16:38.567
L-I disagree, Detective.

16:38.635 --> 16:41.934
I feel as though the scales
have fallen away from my eyes.

16:42.006 --> 16:44.372
I finally understand
this city, you know.

16:44.441 --> 16:48.434
What it takes to deal with it,
how to meet it on its own terms,

16:48.512 --> 16:52.141
what it takes to help others,
how others, they need to be helped.

16:52.216 --> 16:54.150
This is not High Noon, 4B.

16:54.218 --> 16:57.187
I have to say that
your reaction typifies...

16:57.254 --> 17:00.155
what the average citizen
can expect from law enforcement.

17:00.224 --> 17:04.627
A-A knowing,
haughty indifference.

17:08.531 --> 17:10.965
I gotta go, 4B.

17:11.035 --> 17:14.630
Me and my haughty indifference will be
at that tenant meeting tomorrow night.

17:42.066 --> 17:44.000
Laurie.

17:51.185 --> 17:52.982
Laurie?

18:01.729 --> 18:04.994
Laurie! It's me, John.

18:05.066 --> 18:08.092
Hi, Johnny.
There's a beer in the fridge.

18:08.169 --> 18:10.103
Okay.

18:10.171 --> 18:12.435
I'll just be a minute.

18:25.686 --> 18:27.620
Can I get you a towel?

18:27.688 --> 18:30.657
I can get one. Thanks.

18:32.193 --> 18:35.287
Well, I just ran out of excuses
for comin' in there.

18:36.530 --> 18:38.964
Since when did you
ever need an excuse?

19:14.835 --> 19:17.099
I could cook for us here.

19:18.506 --> 19:20.531
I thought we were
gonna go out.

19:20.608 --> 19:23.099
- Okay.
- You're not hungry?

19:23.177 --> 19:25.111
No, that's fine.

19:31.685 --> 19:34.017
I think I can get work
with someone I went to school with.

19:34.088 --> 19:38.286
- Jimmy Craig.
- James Craig who prosecutes narcotics?

19:38.359 --> 19:40.452
Yeah, in the district
attorney's office.

19:41.862 --> 19:43.796
You're kidding me.

19:43.864 --> 19:45.798
No, I'm not kidding.

19:45.866 --> 19:48.767
Are you nuts, Laurie?
Those people are scumbags.

19:48.836 --> 19:51.100
- You don't know Jimmy Craig.
- I'm not talking aboutJimmy Craig.

19:51.172 --> 19:53.072
I'm talkin' about
the people you prosecute.

19:53.140 --> 19:56.075
I didn't realize
I needed a note from you.

19:56.143 --> 20:01.308
I am not out in the streets so you can
wind up dealin' with creeps like that.

20:01.382 --> 20:04.317
It's a job, John.
I'm not mud wrestling with them.

20:04.385 --> 20:06.649
Look, I don't even know
if I'm going to do it.

20:06.720 --> 20:09.484
Don't load me down with teenage
fantasies about making the world safe...

20:09.557 --> 20:11.149
while I stay home and bake.

20:11.225 --> 20:13.386
- It made me crazy while we were married.
- And that was just sex?

20:13.461 --> 20:16.589
- You got in the shower with me.
- Did you push me away?

20:30.044 --> 20:31.978
You're right.

20:34.682 --> 20:37.981
This has to stop.

20:38.052 --> 20:42.352
I just kept hoping
that we could remain close.

20:42.423 --> 20:44.755
I mean, we've always been
each other's best friend.

20:44.825 --> 20:47.350
- I wanna stay close.
- But we can't.

20:47.428 --> 20:51.990
It's too complicated.
We can't stay inside the lines.

20:52.066 --> 20:53.658
Perfect.

21:09.783 --> 21:12.251
Yeah, this is DetectiveJohn Kelly
of the 15th Squad.

21:12.319 --> 21:14.253
I have a shooting victim,
D.O.A.,

21:14.321 --> 21:17.722
at 626 Park Avenue,
12th floor.

21:17.791 --> 21:20.658
No, no apartment number.
The whole floor's an apartment.

21:23.531 --> 21:25.499
You want some water
or something to drink?

21:25.566 --> 21:29.662
- No.
- You want to tell me what happened?

21:29.737 --> 21:32.501
He was drunk. Uh, we argued.

21:32.573 --> 21:34.507
In fact, we argued about you.

21:34.575 --> 21:38.170
He hit me, I went into the bedroom
and got the gun.

21:38.245 --> 21:40.179
I came back
and told him to leave.

21:40.247 --> 21:43.011
- He hit me again, and I shot him.
- Where'd you get the gun?

21:43.083 --> 21:46.678
He gave it to me a year ago when another
apartment in the building was robbed.

21:46.754 --> 21:49.621
Okay, so you went
into the bedroom and got it...

21:49.690 --> 21:51.681
after he struck you
the first time?

21:51.759 --> 21:54.227
- Yes.
- You tell him you were gonna do this?

21:54.295 --> 21:57.264
No, he went to get a drink,
and that's when I got the gun.

21:59.567 --> 22:03.799
Tell me again what happened
when you came out of the bedroom.

22:05.372 --> 22:07.863
I told him to leave,
and he hit me.

22:07.942 --> 22:10.001
- While you held the gun on him.
- Yes.

22:10.077 --> 22:12.910
- Where did he hit you?
- In the face.

22:12.980 --> 22:15.414
- How many times? Two, three?
- Several times.

22:15.482 --> 22:17.950
- Three.
- Then what happened?

22:18.018 --> 22:19.508
I pointed the gun
and shot him.

22:19.587 --> 22:22.021
Did he grab at it
while you trained it on him?

22:22.089 --> 22:24.284
No, I took a step back
and then I fired.

22:26.060 --> 22:28.426
Okay.

22:30.097 --> 22:32.395
Are you sure he hit you,
Mrs. Wagner?

22:34.735 --> 22:37.169
Yes.

22:37.238 --> 22:40.105
I'm surprised that you
would ask me that question.

22:40.174 --> 22:42.734
I don't think you
should say any more.

22:42.810 --> 22:45.074
What do you mean?

22:45.145 --> 22:47.670
No new marks
or bruises on you.

22:47.748 --> 22:50.080
The place is clean,
no sign of a struggle.

22:50.150 --> 22:53.950
No contact wounds, powder residue
on your husband's body...

22:54.021 --> 22:56.785
the way there would be
if he was shot at close range.

22:56.857 --> 23:00.588
- I'm telling the truth.
- I don't know what happened tonight...

23:00.661 --> 23:02.720
but you're not telling the truth,
so don't say any more.

23:02.796 --> 23:05.629
Why are you talking
to me like this?

23:06.967 --> 23:08.901
Because I've got to
take you in,

23:08.969 --> 23:13.338
so shut up until you
speak to your attorney.

23:49.343 --> 23:51.971
- How's it goin', Lieutenant?
- Good morning.

23:53.314 --> 23:56.249
- Good morning, Lieutenant.
- Good morning, Sergeant.

23:58.085 --> 24:00.019
- How ya doin', Sarge?
- Hey, Detective?

24:00.087 --> 24:02.885
We're throwin' a racket for Hanson
tomorrow. The kid's gettin' married.

24:02.956 --> 24:04.890
All right, here.

24:07.027 --> 24:09.962
Who caught that liquor store homicide
you were out on yesterday, Detective?

24:10.030 --> 24:13.466
Walker. Uh, let me see.
Something come in?

24:13.534 --> 24:15.798
Yeah.

24:15.869 --> 24:18.895
And that's the guy
he collared's daughter.

24:25.379 --> 24:27.472
You arrested my father yesterday.

24:27.548 --> 24:29.982
The detective handling that
should be here any minute.

24:30.050 --> 24:34.077
My father didn't rob that liquor store.
He didn't shoot those people.

24:34.154 --> 24:36.088
- You sure about that?
- Yes.

24:36.156 --> 24:38.647
I can prove it.

24:40.361 --> 24:42.295
Um, here.

24:42.363 --> 24:44.763
Let's go in there.

24:49.336 --> 24:52.237
He was at home
when that robbery happened.

24:52.306 --> 24:54.900
He, um...

24:54.975 --> 24:58.741
He books numbers. He stays at home
till the number comes out.

24:58.812 --> 25:02.646
The money helps with my medical bills.
It violates his parole.

25:02.716 --> 25:06.015
- That's why he had $850 when we arrested him.
- Yes.

25:06.086 --> 25:08.384
You were with him yesterday,
in the house the whole morning?

25:08.455 --> 25:13.222
No, I was at the doctor's.
I have asthma. But I know he was home.

25:14.728 --> 25:17.026
Okay, that's gonna be real helpful.

25:17.097 --> 25:19.122
Are you going to let him go?

25:19.199 --> 25:21.463
We're definitely gonna
keep looking into things.

25:21.535 --> 25:25.130
Why can't you let him go?
I told you he was home.

25:25.205 --> 25:30.233
Being at the doctor, you can't actually
verify your father's whereabouts.

25:35.115 --> 25:37.675
I'm by myself now in that house.

25:39.286 --> 25:42.744
- I'm alone there.
- We got other information coming in.

25:42.823 --> 25:46.884
You keep a good thought how things
are gonna work out. Come on.

25:49.863 --> 25:53.560
- You got any pets to keep you company?
- No.

25:53.634 --> 25:55.568
I'm allergic.

25:57.538 --> 26:01.941
Uh... I'm up late, so...

26:02.009 --> 26:04.944
if you're worried about anything,
give me a call.

26:19.860 --> 26:22.294
Anything come in about
that liquor store case?

26:22.362 --> 26:25.456
Yeah. We got an anonymous tip
during the night.

26:25.532 --> 26:28.467
Of course, you already know that,
don't you, Sipowicz?

26:28.535 --> 26:30.469
Sarge told me
you looked at my messages.

26:30.537 --> 26:33.870
Yeah, I glanced at it.
Someone calls in, heard somebody...

26:33.941 --> 26:36.034
talkin' about pullin' that job,
we should check it out.

26:36.109 --> 26:39.567
An anonymous tip from a gin mill pay
phone about an overheard conversation.

26:39.646 --> 26:41.637
- Sounds very hot.
- All I'm saying is,

26:41.715 --> 26:45.242
we should check that bar out, see if
anybody knows anything about that call.

26:45.319 --> 26:48.584
Look, Sipowicz, what did you do?
Take a vow to make my life miserable?

26:48.655 --> 26:50.646
We popped the guy who did this.

26:50.724 --> 26:52.954
You don't come,
I'm goin' over there by myself.

26:53.026 --> 26:56.484
Maybe you'd like that.
You could toss back a few shots.

26:58.165 --> 27:00.099
Who drives?

27:10.277 --> 27:14.407
I think Mrs. Wagner's patience and
courtesy have been abused long enough.

27:14.481 --> 27:17.109
I'm sorry to detain you
for so long.

27:17.184 --> 27:19.652
We had to collect
the crime scene report...

27:19.720 --> 27:21.950
and medical examiner's findings.

27:22.022 --> 27:24.957
Neither one support Mrs. Wagner's
account of the incident.

27:25.025 --> 27:28.358
In addition, Detective Kelly states you
made an incriminating solicitation...

27:28.428 --> 27:30.362
to him the night before.

27:30.430 --> 27:33.456
Unless we get more information, we're
gonna have to arraign this as a murder.

27:33.534 --> 27:36.970
Gentlemen, I'm not gonna try this case
in a detectives'squad room.

27:37.037 --> 27:40.131
Let me assure you,
the absence of powder residue...

27:40.207 --> 27:43.199
does not preclude
a close-range weapon discharge.

27:43.277 --> 27:45.768
Nor does an apartment failing
to show signs of a struggle...

27:45.846 --> 27:47.780
mean a struggle didn't happen.

27:47.848 --> 27:51.978
As far as Mrs. Wagner's ostensibly
soliciting Detective Kelly...

27:52.052 --> 27:53.986
to kill her husband,

27:54.054 --> 27:56.488
it would take me five minutes
to convince a jury...

27:56.557 --> 28:00.049
that was a confused
and ultimately innocuous remark.

28:00.127 --> 28:02.425
So innocuous, in fact,
that at the time,

28:02.496 --> 28:05.397
- the detective choose not to report it.
- Mrs. Wagner.

28:05.465 --> 28:08.195
Talk to me, Detective Kelly,
and only to me.

28:08.268 --> 28:10.532
On which subject,
you should also understand...

28:10.604 --> 28:13.664
that since you failed to give
Mrs. Wagner her Miranda warning,

28:13.740 --> 28:16.538
nothing she said to you
in her apartment last night...

28:16.610 --> 28:19.340
is going to be
admissible in court.

28:19.413 --> 28:23.543
She didn't need Miranda. When she
talked to me, she wasn't a suspect.

28:23.617 --> 28:27.678
But when she became a suspect, I advised
her to keep quiet until she had counsel.

28:27.754 --> 28:31.019
That's a difference of opinion
we'll take up before a judge.

28:31.091 --> 28:34.288
And you're just dying to get
to bat on this one, aren't you?

28:34.361 --> 28:37.888
- Pump up that bill.
- What do you think I should do?

28:37.965 --> 28:40.331
He's not your lawyer,
Mrs. Wagner.

28:40.400 --> 28:42.698
Mrs. Wagner, I can imagine
something like this...

28:42.769 --> 28:44.703
Your husband came home.
He was loaded.

28:44.771 --> 28:47.797
You were afraid you were gonna get
another beating, so you got the gun.

28:47.874 --> 28:50.434
When you came out, you asked him
to leave, and he wouldn't.

28:50.510 --> 28:54.469
Maybe he started toward you, and so
you shot him from across the room.

28:54.548 --> 28:56.379
- It's not...
- Don't answer.

28:56.450 --> 28:58.384
She's not gonna answer you,
Detective.

28:58.452 --> 29:00.977
If that's the way it happened,
you better say so now...

29:01.054 --> 29:03.420
because the D.A. Can write
this up as manslaughter.

29:03.490 --> 29:06.186
A legal aid attorney can get you
easy time, maybe even off,

29:06.259 --> 29:08.454
let alone a seven-figure ace
like this.

29:08.528 --> 29:10.689
You're wasting everybody's time.

29:10.764 --> 29:13.028
Mrs. Wagner,
don't underestimate us.

29:13.100 --> 29:15.261
If you lie, we will nail you.

29:15.335 --> 29:18.099
Tell the truth,
and I will testify for you.

29:18.171 --> 29:20.435
I will verify that you'd been
beaten up the night before...

29:20.507 --> 29:22.441
and you were
emotionally distraught.

29:22.509 --> 29:24.909
- Detective...
- But this smart son of a bitch...

29:24.978 --> 29:26.946
wants you to stick
to your story.

29:27.014 --> 29:30.279
That's gonna land you in Rikers Island
with the whores and junkies.

29:30.350 --> 29:33.877
Not him, you.
So you make the decision.

29:33.954 --> 29:36.718
You're the one who's
gonna be doing the time.

29:36.790 --> 29:39.623
Lieutenant, I want him out of this room
so I can consult with my client.

29:50.170 --> 29:52.468
How's it going, guys?

29:52.539 --> 29:54.973
Were you working here
last night?

29:55.042 --> 29:58.136
- I come in 11:30, pick up receipts.
- Is this your place?

29:58.211 --> 30:01.305
Yeah, night guy comes on around 7:00
if you want to talk to him.

30:01.381 --> 30:03.975
We got information a phone call
was made from here last night,

30:04.051 --> 30:07.111
may have a connection with a
robbery-homicide we're investigating.

30:07.187 --> 30:10.020
Somebody overheard a guy
talkin'on that pay phone...

30:10.090 --> 30:13.423
- about robbin'a liquor store yesterday.
- Is that right?

30:13.493 --> 30:15.427
Night guy say anything to you?

30:15.495 --> 30:17.656
Anybody talk to him about
overhearing a call like that?

30:17.731 --> 30:20.495
No. Where'd you get
this information?

30:20.567 --> 30:22.330
Look, I'll ask the questions.

30:22.402 --> 30:25.337
- Hey, pal, were you in here last night?
- Don't involve me in this.

30:25.405 --> 30:28.033
Is it a crime to have a beer
and read the paper?

30:28.108 --> 30:30.338
Hey, hey, hey.
We're only asking you.

30:30.410 --> 30:34.005
Did you hear somebody shootin' off
their mouth about pullin' a job?

30:34.081 --> 30:36.276
Absolutely not.

30:36.349 --> 30:39.079
I mind my own business.
I don't interfere.

30:39.152 --> 30:41.882
And I expect to be treated
that way in return.

30:41.955 --> 30:44.719
Okay, well, we just
received this hot tip,

30:44.791 --> 30:46.986
and, uh, we're covering
all our bases.

30:47.060 --> 30:50.029
Unless you got
any more questions.

30:58.472 --> 31:00.406
- Wait here.
- What are you talkin' about?

31:00.474 --> 31:03.238
- Wait. That's our guy at the bar.
- That skel by the phone?

31:03.310 --> 31:05.972
You really are in warped
territory now, Sipowicz.

31:06.046 --> 31:08.480
- Yeah, right.
- You got a serious case of dick-brain.

31:08.548 --> 31:11.711
And I'm telling you that skel
at the corner knows something, huh?

31:11.785 --> 31:14.379
He's lookin' for us. He's been sittin'
there waitin' for us to come in.

31:14.454 --> 31:16.388
- Goddamn you. I've been waiting here...
- There he is.

31:16.456 --> 31:20.893
Hey. Hey, pal. Hey, yo.
Hey, pal. Come on.

31:20.961 --> 31:22.986
- I wanna ask you a question.
- What do you want? What have I done?

31:23.063 --> 31:25.657
I just wanna talk to you. Just wanna
ask a question. What's your name?

31:25.732 --> 31:29.224
Dwight. This is like the Gestapo,
like a World War II movie in Germany.

31:29.302 --> 31:31.236
You phoned that tip in,
didn't you?

31:31.304 --> 31:34.273
You left a message, and you've been
sitting, waiting for us to come in.

31:34.341 --> 31:37.833
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Listen to me, Dwight!

31:37.911 --> 31:40.675
You made that call. I know it.
My partner knows it.

31:40.747 --> 31:43.011
You know it. So let's stop
kidding each other, huh?

31:43.083 --> 31:46.746
- I don't know anything, I don't wanna...
- Settle down.

31:46.820 --> 31:49.516
Boy, you'd think a person
who lives alone and keeps to himself...

31:49.589 --> 31:51.523
wouldn't get involved
in something like this.

31:51.591 --> 31:54.185
You are involved, Dwight,
because you made that call.

31:54.261 --> 31:58.960
Tell me what you know, we'll figure the
best way to keep your name out of it.

31:59.032 --> 32:01.296
Come on!

32:04.371 --> 32:06.805
All I know is that I
wish he would move out.

32:06.873 --> 32:08.932
Who? Move out of where?

32:09.009 --> 32:11.136
Frank Archer.
Out of the Delaware Arms.

32:11.211 --> 32:14.305
- On 46th?
- Yeah.

32:14.381 --> 32:16.975
Yeah, what? Come on.

32:17.050 --> 32:19.985
What if I told you he fired a gun off
in his room the other night?

32:20.053 --> 32:22.487
He shot a bullet into the wall.
I share that wall.

32:22.556 --> 32:24.820
I have adult-onset diabetes.
How do you think I felt?

32:24.891 --> 32:28.725
- What did he shoot the gun off for?
- Why ask me?

32:28.795 --> 32:32.253
I'm the one foolish enough to see if he
was all right after I heard the gunshot.

32:32.332 --> 32:35.893
"It works,"he says, as he's walking
down the hall with a gun in his hand.

32:35.969 --> 32:38.267
Drunk as a skunk.
He's three sheets to the wind.

32:38.338 --> 32:40.932
- That was the night before last?
- Yeah.

32:41.007 --> 32:42.998
Then last night he walks
into the Shamrock, big as life,

32:43.076 --> 32:45.010
being a big shot,

32:45.078 --> 32:48.070
telling some woman on the phone
how he robbed a liquor store...

32:48.148 --> 32:51.083
wearing a fake mustache,
and he just came into a lot of money.

32:52.586 --> 32:55.180
He... He saw me.

32:55.255 --> 32:58.918
He knew he nearly put me into
cardiac failure blowin' off that gun.

32:58.992 --> 33:02.189
Do you think that he
bought a round for me?

33:02.262 --> 33:05.356
- How tall is this guy, Dwight?
- Six-foot-three.

33:16.621 --> 33:19.613
Till just recently,
I was a tenant here in the building,

33:19.690 --> 33:22.853
but tonight I'm gonna be speaking
to you as a police officer...

33:22.927 --> 33:25.691
about some of the things that you
can do to make yourselves...

33:25.763 --> 33:27.697
and your building more safe.

33:27.765 --> 33:29.926
On the table,
I've put some literature...

33:30.001 --> 33:34.870
which talks about the different locks
and bolts we think are most effective...

33:34.939 --> 33:37.601
and some of the precautions you
can take while entering and exiting...

33:37.675 --> 33:39.609
the common areas of the building.

33:39.677 --> 33:42.646
Elevators, hallways, stairs,
things like that.

33:42.713 --> 33:46.308
In terms of the unpleasant reality
of actually being accosted,

33:46.384 --> 33:49.615
most of you know that Mr. Goldstein
of apartment 4B...

33:49.687 --> 33:52.986
just recently curtailed
the mugging career of a perpetrator...

33:53.057 --> 33:57.721
who had victimized some
of the tenants here in the building.

33:57.795 --> 34:00.662
Mr. Goldstein happened
to have a gun on him...

34:00.731 --> 34:03.598
while he was doing his laundry,
and the thief attempted to rob him.

34:03.668 --> 34:06.535
And he used it. And on that occasion,
it worked for him.

34:06.604 --> 34:10.233
But I must tell you that we
don't think it's a good idea.

34:10.308 --> 34:12.833
Our recommendation is,
give it up.

34:12.909 --> 34:15.606
Whatever they're looking for...
money, jewelry... give it up.

34:15.679 --> 34:18.342
Call us,
and we'll do our job.

34:18.416 --> 34:22.443
Now, having said that,
having given you those warnings,

34:23.955 --> 34:26.685
I want to say
don't live afraid.

34:26.757 --> 34:29.817
Don't hide. Don't be angry.

34:29.893 --> 34:34.092
And don't go out and look for vengeance
on those people who break the law.

34:34.165 --> 34:36.963
Those are just other ways
of giving up your freedom...

34:37.034 --> 34:39.969
the same way you would if you
were victimized by violence.

34:40.036 --> 34:43.905
Now, it's easy for me to...
easy for me to stand here...

34:43.975 --> 34:46.876
and say these things and tell you
how to live your lives,

34:46.944 --> 34:50.380
tell you not to react to the things
that happen to you.

34:50.447 --> 34:53.315
And I would never
put myself up as an expert...

34:53.384 --> 34:55.978
on how to not hold on to things.

34:57.955 --> 35:00.321
My, uh, my dad...

35:00.391 --> 35:02.723
was shot down
on the streets, so...

35:02.793 --> 35:05.261
I, uh, I tend to...

35:05.329 --> 35:07.763
tend to be a little bit
more careful.

35:09.066 --> 35:12.558
Maybe, uh, a little bit
overprotective...

35:16.307 --> 35:19.276
To the point of, uh,

35:19.343 --> 35:22.642
maybe cramping
another person's style.

35:22.713 --> 35:25.273
Anyway, uh, my point is...

35:25.349 --> 35:28.785
that, uh, this is your city.

35:28.853 --> 35:31.686
This is your city,
not the bad guys'.

35:31.756 --> 35:33.690
This is your life.

35:35.293 --> 35:37.227
So be free.

35:39.530 --> 35:41.623
Live it as free as you can,

35:41.699 --> 35:44.759
and, uh, we'll be there for you.

35:44.835 --> 35:48.271
And, uh, we'll try
not to get in your way.

35:51.709 --> 35:53.643
Okay?

35:56.414 --> 35:58.473
- Quit pushing me around.
- Come on!

35:58.549 --> 36:00.949
- I didn't do anything.
- Nah, you didn't do anything.

36:01.018 --> 36:03.885
We didn't find seven traveler's checks
endorsed to that liquor store...

36:03.954 --> 36:06.286
Iying on the floor
of your pigsty room, huh?

36:06.357 --> 36:09.190
This isn't a gun, and it doesn't
caliber-match with the piece...

36:09.260 --> 36:11.592
that croaked those people
in that store.

36:11.662 --> 36:14.825
It stinks from being just shot off.
But you didn't do anything!

36:14.899 --> 36:18.266
And you didn't puke all over my shoes
and the bottom of my pants!

36:18.336 --> 36:21.669
- You miserable piece of crap, you!
- Wait a second.

36:21.739 --> 36:23.673
Here it comes again!

36:23.741 --> 36:27.268
Here, get him in there.

36:31.682 --> 36:34.276
How bad you gonna make me look on this?

36:34.352 --> 36:36.547
- What are you talkin' about?
- Don't play with me.

36:36.620 --> 36:38.952
I busted the wrong guy.
You got me by the balls.

36:39.023 --> 36:41.457
Yeah, that's what I'm after.
I want all the credit.

36:41.525 --> 36:45.461
I'm gonna climb over your back.
I'm hoping I can still make chief.

36:45.529 --> 36:48.464
Look, you made a wrong I.D.

36:48.532 --> 36:50.625
It happens.
Nobody's lookin' to hurt you.

36:50.701 --> 36:53.795
As far as I'm concerned,
pickin' up this asshole was your idea.

36:53.871 --> 36:57.466
Hey, you hit my shoes one more time,
I'm gonna fracture your skull.

37:01.312 --> 37:03.906
- You got him?
- Yeah, I got him.

37:11.489 --> 37:13.423
What was that?

37:13.491 --> 37:17.427
New suspect in that liquor store
shooting. Note his height.

37:17.495 --> 37:20.328
- Note the murder weapon.
- Way to go, Andy.

37:20.398 --> 37:24.562
Yeah, anybody asks,
it was Walker's collar.

37:25.936 --> 37:28.268
Team player that I am.

37:28.339 --> 37:30.534
You going to Hanson's
racket tonight?

37:30.608 --> 37:32.405
I'll stick my face in.

37:35.679 --> 37:38.079
Mrs. Wagner's asked
to make a statement.

37:38.149 --> 37:41.016
I want it on the record
that it's against advice of counsel.

37:50.861 --> 37:54.558
I did not plan to kill my husband.

37:54.632 --> 37:57.294
We were extremely unhappy
together.

37:57.368 --> 37:59.768
We'd been unhappy
for a long time.

37:59.837 --> 38:03.466
And I'd...
I'd often, I suppose...

38:03.541 --> 38:06.032
I actually did often wish
that he would die.

38:07.812 --> 38:10.747
I remember seven times
in the past few years...

38:10.815 --> 38:13.716
that he beat me
with his fists very badly.

38:13.784 --> 38:17.584
And I did frequently wish
that he were dead...

38:17.655 --> 38:21.318
or that the relationship
would be over.

38:21.392 --> 38:24.054
And I did say that
I wished he were dead...

38:24.128 --> 38:27.427
and that if I had come home one night
and found him dead, I'd have been glad,

38:27.498 --> 38:29.432
relieved.

38:30.935 --> 38:33.563
But in no way was I asking
Detective Kelly...

38:33.637 --> 38:35.571
to kill him.

38:35.639 --> 38:38.267
Describe the events of the other night
that led to your husband's death.

38:43.681 --> 38:46.275
He came home, and I knew he
was going to beat me...

38:46.350 --> 38:48.511
because of the tone of his voice...

38:48.586 --> 38:51.282
and look he had in his eyes.

38:51.355 --> 38:55.086
And... And I was afraid.

38:58.362 --> 39:01.160
The side of my...

39:01.232 --> 39:04.360
Of my face and ear still ached...

39:04.435 --> 39:08.872
and rang from where he'd hit me
the other night.

39:10.908 --> 39:14.810
I went into the bedroom, got the gun
and told him that he had to leave.

39:14.879 --> 39:17.643
Was it in your mind
at that point to shoot him?

39:17.715 --> 39:19.649
No, it was not.

39:19.717 --> 39:24.086
I wanted him to leave.
I just wanted him... to leave me alone.

39:24.154 --> 39:28.318
Just... Just didn't want him
to hit me anymore.

39:28.392 --> 39:30.519
Tell me, then what happened?

39:30.594 --> 39:34.428
He started toward me, and I said,
Please leave. I mean it."

39:36.066 --> 39:39.866
But he never paid
any attention to me, ever,

39:39.937 --> 39:42.906
in all the years
that we were together.

39:42.973 --> 39:46.204
And he came forward,
and I told him to stop.

39:46.277 --> 39:49.940
I kept backing up, getting further
and further away from him.

39:51.549 --> 39:53.483
And he laughed at me.

39:55.553 --> 39:59.922
He took a step forward,
and I shot him.

40:06.630 --> 40:09.394
I'm sorry.

40:12.036 --> 40:14.266
I'm sorry.

40:17.041 --> 40:19.635
- What does that sound like?
- Manslaughter two.

40:19.710 --> 40:21.644
What kind of time?

40:21.712 --> 40:22.974
That would tend to be
the judge's decision.

40:23.047 --> 40:25.641
Yeah, I know, but in terms
of what you would recommend.

40:25.716 --> 40:27.775
A guess? Three years.

40:27.851 --> 40:32.249
Which he might suspend.

40:36.560 --> 40:39.825
That's a pretty soulful
look, Detective.

40:39.897 --> 40:41.888
What'd she do to you?

40:41.966 --> 40:44.992
Take a thorn out of your paw?

41:04.688 --> 41:08.624
#Baby, I gotta believe #

41:08.692 --> 41:13.129
- # What you say is true ##
- Hey.

41:13.197 --> 41:15.131
How's it goin'?

41:18.235 --> 41:20.169
Hold that thought.

41:20.237 --> 41:22.705
- Hey!
- Hey, congratulations.

41:22.773 --> 41:24.798
Yeah.

41:24.875 --> 41:27.275
- You made it. Come over here.
- Yeah.

41:27.344 --> 41:30.006
Uh, no, I'm just
stopping in for a second.

41:30.080 --> 41:32.014
Is Hanson gonna make it?

41:32.082 --> 41:36.075
I saw him checkin' some bus schedules.
I don't think they mean anything though.

41:36.153 --> 41:39.645
- Hey, look who's here.
- How you doin', Walker?

41:39.723 --> 41:44.160
Fancy gave me the big "attaboy"before
for makin'that new collar.

41:44.228 --> 41:47.163
- Is that right?
- I gotta hand it to you, Sipowicz.

41:47.231 --> 41:49.165
- You stood up for me.
- No problem.

41:49.233 --> 41:51.667
When I'm wrong about somebody,
I say so.

41:51.735 --> 41:53.669
Hey, Walker, no problem.
Case closed.

41:53.737 --> 41:56.968
You don't wanna be a blood brother,
huh?

41:57.041 --> 42:00.135
I'm gettin' more ammo.
Have some. Come on.

42:00.210 --> 42:03.702
- What are you havin'?
- Club soda.

42:03.781 --> 42:07.877
LeeAnn, club soda
and another bourbon and rocks.

42:07.951 --> 42:09.885
Okay.

42:09.953 --> 42:12.615
- You married?
- Not anymore.

42:12.690 --> 42:15.284
- I've been married 27 years.
- Here you go.

42:15.359 --> 42:18.886
Twenty-six on the force.

42:18.962 --> 42:22.363
- So you really are off the booze, huh?
- Yeah.

42:22.433 --> 42:25.368
I like to throw a few back.
I like to have a few after 5:00.

42:25.436 --> 42:28.633
Yeah, that's my line in the sand.

42:28.706 --> 42:30.697
Nothing before 5:00.

42:30.774 --> 42:33.368
That's how I stay on top of it.

42:35.379 --> 42:38.576
Listen, I'm gonna get out of here.

42:38.649 --> 42:40.640
Hey, uh, what's it like?

42:40.718 --> 42:42.743
What do you mean?

42:42.820 --> 42:45.311
You know. Gettin' off booze.

42:45.389 --> 42:49.257
I got shot. I was unconscious.
I don't recommend the approach.

42:49.326 --> 42:52.591
- You go to those meetings?
- No.

42:52.663 --> 42:55.154
I'm doing it
by the seat of my pants.

42:55.232 --> 42:57.564
I don't feel like I'm, uh,
qualified to give advice.

42:57.634 --> 42:59.067
I don't need any advice.

42:59.136 --> 43:03.334
I figure I stick with my line
in the sand, I'll probably be okay.

43:06.477 --> 43:10.379
- You want a ride or something?
- I don't need any rides.

43:10.447 --> 43:14.508
I always drive twice as careful
after I had a few.

43:16.353 --> 43:18.787
- I'll see you, then.
- Yeah, see you.

43:18.856 --> 43:21.689
- You gonna stick around?
- Nah, I'm gonna take off.

43:21.759 --> 43:24.250
- All right. I'll talk to you later.
- Have a good time.

43:24.328 --> 43:26.694
- Congratulations.
- Kelly.

43:26.764 --> 43:29.892
He's okay, your partner.

43:33.370 --> 43:35.304
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

43:42.112 --> 43:44.046
Hey.

43:47.551 --> 43:49.815
It's a free country, right?

43:49.887 --> 43:51.821
Yeah.

43:53.991 --> 43:55.982
I, uh,

43:56.059 --> 43:59.995
heard how you went out of your way
for that society woman.

44:00.063 --> 44:02.793
Yeah, well, I didn't do it
'cause she's a society woman.

44:02.866 --> 44:04.834
All I'm saying...

44:04.902 --> 44:08.599
is that you knew she didn't
plan to do what she did...

44:08.672 --> 44:12.438
and found it in your heart
to try and understand.

44:12.509 --> 44:14.500
What happened, John?

44:14.578 --> 44:16.944
Did she have to confess
before you could forgive her?

44:17.014 --> 44:18.948
- You've had too much to drink.
- Yeah.

44:19.016 --> 44:22.247
And I'm only on my second one.
I am such an easy date.

44:25.022 --> 44:28.116
I think you better
give me my rights.

44:28.192 --> 44:30.183
I don't know what
you're talking about.

44:30.260 --> 44:32.194
I killed Marino and his driver.

44:32.262 --> 44:35.459
- I don't want to hear this from you.
- I'm confessing.

44:35.532 --> 44:37.466
- I'm in your hands.
- Did you hear what I said?

44:37.534 --> 44:41.664
I killed them, and I think
that in time you will forgive me.

44:41.738 --> 44:43.672
Here you go.

44:47.377 --> 44:50.471
DetectiveJohn Kelly?
You got a phone call.

45:06.663 --> 45:08.927
- How is he?
- He's shot in the stomach.

45:08.999 --> 45:11.832
They're trying to get
an operating room.

45:11.902 --> 45:13.836
What's happening?

45:13.904 --> 45:15.838
This Goldstein
was on the D" train.

45:15.906 --> 45:18.431
There's this kid holding up
a 46-year-old lady.

45:18.508 --> 45:21.272
Goldstein's got this target gun,
tries to stop the kid.

45:21.345 --> 45:24.178
The kid's got a gun too,
pops Goldstein twice in the belly.

45:24.248 --> 45:27.615
- They catch anybody?
- No. Got two good descriptions though.

45:31.388 --> 45:34.585
Hey. 4B.

45:34.658 --> 45:36.592
Detective Kelly.

45:37.728 --> 45:40.253
Detective Kelly, I-I got shot.

45:40.330 --> 45:42.628
- Take it easy.
- I'm losin' blood.

45:42.699 --> 45:45.930
I'm losing blood into the peritoneum,
the doctor said.

45:46.003 --> 45:48.699
Just calm down, Mr. Goldstein.

46:41.625 --> 46:43.559
I'm sorry.

46:43.627 --> 46:45.561
He's gone.

46:54.538 --> 46:56.472
PoorJosh.

46:58.175 --> 47:00.109
I know.

47:03.447 --> 47:06.416
I've gotta call his parents.

47:06.483 --> 47:09.611
I don't know their names.
They live somewhere outside Cleveland.

47:09.686 --> 47:12.154
Jack and Frieda Goldstein.

47:14.091 --> 47:16.025
How do you know?

47:16.093 --> 47:18.027
He told me.

47:19.596 --> 47:22.929
Jack and Frieda Goldstein
of Shaker Heights, Ohio.
