00:18.450 --> 00:21.720
Narrator:<i> ...Turns him</i>
<i> into a neighborhood hero.</i>

00:21.720 --> 00:26.650
He bought us a house

Narrator:<i> But when no one hears</i>
<i> from him for months...</i>

00:29.790 --> 00:31.530
I talk to him every day

00:31.530 --> 00:33.190
And he hasn't been
returning my call.

00:33.200 --> 00:36.660
Narrator:<i> ...A bizarre phone</i>
<i> call deepens the mystery.</i>

00:36.670 --> 00:39.270
His voice sounds a little funny.

00:39.270 --> 00:40.900
Somebody could have robbed him.

00:43.270 --> 00:44.840
David:<i> Of course, he's bitter.</i>

00:44.840 --> 00:47.610
He lost a lawsuit
involving millions of dollars.

00:54.150 --> 00:56.750
Narrator:
<i> And an undercover operation...</i>

00:56.750 --> 01:00.620
There was a recording device
sitting in a empty can
of red bull.

01:00.620 --> 01:03.490
Narrator:<i> ...Sends police</i>
<i> looking for answers</i>

01:03.490 --> 01:07.160
<i> Hidden below the surface</i>

01:07.160 --> 01:09.000
She takes a piece of angle iron,

01:09.000 --> 01:12.830
<i> Sticks in the ground,</i>
<i> and whispers,</i>

01:12.840 --> 01:16.270
"tell your boy
to dig six feet down."

01:16.270 --> 01:19.040
Andrew: And this is where
the plot thickens.

[♪♪]

01:28.780 --> 01:31.590
Narrator:<i> Plant city</i>

01:31.590 --> 01:33.920
<i> Back road where life is simple</i>

01:33.920 --> 01:36.390
<i> And agriculture is king.</i>

01:36.390 --> 01:39.530
Plant city is known
for strawberry farms.

01:39.530 --> 01:41.660
<i> It's in between tampa,</i>

01:41.660 --> 01:43.700
The beautiful
golf coast beaches,

01:43.700 --> 01:45.400
And the theme parks of orlando.

01:45.400 --> 01:48.740
You see, in plant city,
it's country.

01:48.740 --> 01:50.940
<i> Most people here</i>
<i> that wanna hear the news,</i>

01:50.940 --> 01:52.340
<i> They go up onto the tree</i>

01:52.340 --> 01:55.040
And sit on milk craze
and baguettes,

01:55.040 --> 01:58.510
And have conversation
about what could have been

01:58.520 --> 01:59.980
And what's not today.

02:02.890 --> 02:05.750
Narrator:
<i> On a January morning in 2010,</i>

02:05.750 --> 02:07.550
<i> The conversation in plant city</i>

02:07.560 --> 02:09.520
<i> Is all about</i>
<i> the law enforcement</i>

02:09.530 --> 02:12.960
<i> That's descended on an</i>
<i> unassuming house in the town.</i>

02:12.960 --> 02:15.700
<i> The police are responding</i>
<i> to a tip in a case</i>

02:15.700 --> 02:19.230
<i> That has puzzled</i>
<i> this community for months.</i>

02:19.230 --> 02:21.100
There are news cameras
all around

02:21.100 --> 02:24.770
Trying to get just a glimpse
of what law enforcement finds.

02:24.770 --> 02:28.040
<i> And the police have reason</i>
<i> to believe that the body</i>

02:28.040 --> 02:31.450
Is buried deep in the earth
in the backyard.

02:33.920 --> 02:36.580
Narrator:<i> The forensic team</i>
<i> focuses on something</i>

02:36.590 --> 02:40.390
<i> That seems out of place</i>
<i> in the rural backyard,</i>

02:40.390 --> 02:43.060
<i> A large cement slab.</i>

02:43.060 --> 02:46.430
That morning we began
breaking up the concrete slab.

02:48.000 --> 02:51.460
<i> We finally get down</i>
<i> to about six feet, two inches.</i>

02:51.470 --> 02:54.070
And one of the crime scene
technicians says,

02:54.070 --> 02:56.740
"I think I've got something."

02:56.740 --> 02:59.670
<i> We carefully start</i>
<i> wiping away the dirt</i>

02:59.680 --> 03:02.740
And we realize
that it's a body lean.

03:05.920 --> 03:07.980
Andrew:<i> The body had been there</i>
<i> for nine months.</i>

03:07.980 --> 03:13.950
You can almost imagine
the smell and the stench.

03:13.960 --> 03:17.690
They can immediately determine
that it's human remains

03:17.690 --> 03:20.660
But they have to see
whose remains they are.

03:22.560 --> 03:25.270
Narrator:<i> The investigators</i>
<i> believe they finally uncovered</i>

03:25.270 --> 03:28.770
<i> The evidence they've been</i>
<i> seeking of a brutal murder.</i>

03:28.770 --> 03:31.370
This murder
was the tragic finale

03:31.370 --> 03:33.710
To a rags to riches story

03:33.710 --> 03:37.850
That ended up with a person
buried in the backyard.

03:41.980 --> 03:44.720
Narrator:<i> The chances</i>
<i> of winning florida's lottery</i>

03:44.720 --> 03:48.460
<i> Are an astounding</i>
<i> fifteen million to one.</i>

03:48.460 --> 03:51.190
<i> But in places like the</i>
<i> hardscrabble community</i>

03:51.190 --> 03:54.400
<i> Of lakeland, florida,</i>
<i> dreams about hitting it big</i>

03:54.400 --> 03:57.500
<i> Provide a welcome break</i>
<i> from reality.</i>

03:57.500 --> 03:59.800
In our community,
we don't have too many things

03:59.800 --> 04:03.600
That we can get into without
getting into a little mischief.

04:03.610 --> 04:05.270
Greg:
<i> A lot of people play lottery.</i>

04:05.270 --> 04:07.140
You dream hitting the lottery.

04:07.140 --> 04:08.680
I dream hitting the lottery.

04:10.080 --> 04:11.680
Narrator:
<i> For greg smith's friend,</i>

04:11.680 --> 04:13.680
<i>Abraham shakespeare, that dream</i>

04:13.680 --> 04:17.550
<i> Is one of the few things</i>
<i> that keep his spirits high.</i>

04:17.550 --> 04:20.290
I think he wished
and hoped and prayed

04:20.290 --> 04:22.620
That he would hit the lottery.

04:22.630 --> 04:26.430
<i> But abraham</i>
<i>wasn't a real fortunate person.</i>

04:26.430 --> 04:28.630
He left school to go to work

04:28.630 --> 04:31.500
To see what he can do
about helping his family.

04:31.500 --> 04:33.830
<i> He started out</i>
<i> in the orange groves,</i>

04:33.840 --> 04:36.840
<i> Picking fruit,</i>
<i> mowing yards, raking yards,</i>

04:36.840 --> 04:40.110
<i> And whatever money he made,</i>
<i> he helped his family with it.</i>

04:40.110 --> 04:43.240
Abraham stayed
with his mother and, um,

04:43.250 --> 04:45.150
Helped her with the bills
and-- and--

04:45.150 --> 04:48.080
And was pretty content
being a day laborer.

04:48.080 --> 04:51.380
And his life
was based around his mother

04:51.390 --> 04:53.720
<i> And taking care of her.</i>

04:53.720 --> 04:56.190
Tammy:<i> Abraham</i>
<i> would sit on the porch</i>

04:56.190 --> 04:58.730
<i> And he would just tell us,</i>

04:58.730 --> 05:01.130
You know, if he had money,
what he would do,

05:01.130 --> 05:04.470
And he would like say
what big house he wanted

05:04.470 --> 05:07.270
Or nice cars.

05:07.270 --> 05:09.340
And, you know,
yeah, he was a dreamer.

05:12.940 --> 05:15.610
Andrew: On November 15th, 2006,

05:15.610 --> 05:17.810
Abraham is working some odd jobs

05:17.810 --> 05:19.350
With a man named michael ford,

05:19.350 --> 05:21.480
And they stopped
at a local convenience store

05:21.480 --> 05:24.220
To pick up some food and drinks.

05:24.220 --> 05:26.820
Cedric:<i> The guy asked him</i>
<i> if he wanted a soda, um,</i>

05:26.820 --> 05:30.460
And abraham said, "no, just
give me two lottery tickets."

05:31.960 --> 05:34.960
<i> That night,</i>
<i> they got it on the store,</i>

05:34.960 --> 05:36.700
<i> He came to my house.</i>

05:36.700 --> 05:38.600
He said, "your cousin
just hit the lottery."

05:39.570 --> 05:41.900
He won $31 million.

05:43.970 --> 05:45.510
Narrator:
<i> Abraham decides to take</i>

05:45.510 --> 05:50.340
<i> A one-time payout</i>
<i> of $16.9 million.</i>

05:50.350 --> 05:52.910
<i> The money lets him show</i>
<i> a generous side</i>

05:52.910 --> 05:55.320
<i> That he never could before.</i>

05:55.320 --> 05:56.550
Tammy:<i> He bought us a house.</i>

05:56.550 --> 05:58.920
<i> He had that heart to give.</i>

05:58.920 --> 06:01.660
He just felt like
that's what he needed to do,

06:01.660 --> 06:03.460
Just help people.

06:03.460 --> 06:06.130
Narrator:<i> When abraham</i>
<i> learns that a local barber,</i>

06:06.130 --> 06:08.860
<i> His friend and former boss,</i>
<i> greg smith</i>

06:08.860 --> 06:12.600
<i> Is trying to get</i>

<i> He steps in to help.</i>

06:14.670 --> 06:18.410
He bring me this envelope,
cashier's check in my name.

06:18.410 --> 06:21.740
<i> I said, "I'm not gonna take</i>
<i> this money for free from you.</i>

06:21.740 --> 06:24.310
I'm gonna take the payments
that I was gonna do to the bank

06:24.310 --> 06:26.150
And I'll pay you
the same amount."

06:26.150 --> 06:28.680
Narrator:
<i> After a life spent in poverty,</i>

06:28.690 --> 06:31.280
<i> Abraham treats himself, too.</i>

06:31.290 --> 06:33.150
He bought a home
in north lakeland,

06:33.160 --> 06:35.820
<i> Which is a--</i>
<i> was a home he dreamed of.</i>

06:40.060 --> 06:42.160
Tammy:<i> It was scary</i>
<i> because he didn't know</i>

06:42.160 --> 06:44.360
<i> How to manage his money.</i>

06:44.370 --> 06:45.900
He had an entourage around him.

06:45.900 --> 06:47.970
But half of those people,
he didn't know.

06:47.970 --> 06:50.640
<i> They knew he couldn't read,</i>
<i> they know he couldn't write,</i>

06:50.640 --> 06:53.840
<i> They know he can sign them</i>
<i> with his name.</i>

06:53.840 --> 06:57.210
He said,
"man, every time I turn around,

06:57.210 --> 06:59.010
Somebody want something."

06:59.010 --> 07:03.550
He was their cash cow
and they milked him daily.

07:03.550 --> 07:05.590
Tammy:<i> I said it</i>
[indistinct]<i> now, so abraham,</i>

07:05.590 --> 07:08.190
<i> You got to think now,</i>
<i> you can go through this money.</i>

07:08.190 --> 07:09.890
You got people
coming from everywhere,

07:09.890 --> 07:11.390
So you gotta be careful.

07:11.390 --> 07:14.590
But he was so happy
not to be poor anymore,

07:14.600 --> 07:17.870
That wasn't even
a thought in his mind.

07:19.800 --> 07:23.140
Narrator:<i> By October 2008,</i>
<i> less than two years</i>

07:23.140 --> 07:24.600
<i> After winning the jackpot,</i>

07:24.610 --> 07:29.080
<i> Abraham is down</i>
<i> to his last $2 million.</i>

07:29.080 --> 07:31.810
<i> Then his luck</i>
<i> changes once again,</i>

07:31.810 --> 07:34.550
<i> When a local business woman</i>
<i> named dee dee moore</i>

07:34.550 --> 07:39.090
<i> Takes an interest in abraham's</i>
<i> rags to riches story.</i>

07:39.090 --> 07:42.620
Dee dee moore was introduced
to him by a mutual friend.

07:42.620 --> 07:44.690
<i> He had an interesting</i>
<i> story to tell</i>

07:44.690 --> 07:48.430
And she proposed
that she write a book on him.

07:48.430 --> 07:52.630
And I think
he was very captivated by that.

07:52.630 --> 07:55.040
Narrator:<i> But as the two</i>
<i> start to work on the book,</i>

07:55.040 --> 07:57.710
<i> It doesn't take long</i>
<i> before dee dee discovers</i>

07:57.710 --> 08:01.640
<i> That abraham is in over</i>
<i> his head financially.</i>

08:01.640 --> 08:03.680
She found out
that he hadn't paid

08:03.680 --> 08:04.980
The taxes on his house,

08:04.980 --> 08:07.510
That he was behind
on certain bills

08:07.520 --> 08:10.050
And so she made
a pretty reasonable proposal.

08:10.050 --> 08:13.120
Why don't you let me
handle your finances?

08:13.120 --> 08:14.720
Cedric:
<i> When I first met dee dee,</i>

08:14.720 --> 08:16.590
She came serious
with that attitude.

08:16.590 --> 08:21.590
"listen, I'm abraham's
financial adviser.

08:21.600 --> 08:23.130
<i> Money is not being returned</i>

08:23.130 --> 08:26.200
And I'm not here to lose money
but to make money."

08:26.200 --> 08:27.740
It made perfect sense.

08:30.540 --> 08:33.510
Narrator:<i> With dee dee</i>
<i> handling abraham's finances,</i>

08:33.510 --> 08:35.680
<i> She advises him to stay home</i>

08:35.680 --> 08:38.080
<i> Away from all</i>
<i> the outstretched hands</i>

08:38.080 --> 08:40.280
<i> That follow him everywhere.</i>

08:40.280 --> 08:42.150
And he just
couldn't turn them away.

08:42.150 --> 08:43.820
He couldn't say no.

08:43.820 --> 08:46.420
But he was really unhappy.

08:46.420 --> 08:48.690
Tammy:<i> We just didn't see him</i>
<i> no more.</i>

08:48.690 --> 08:51.660
We thought, well, maybe
he didn't wanna be bothered,

08:51.660 --> 08:54.030
So we gave him
the benefit of the doubt.

08:56.970 --> 09:00.630
Narrator:<i> After several weeks</i>
<i> without any word from abraham,</i>

09:00.640 --> 09:03.640
<i> His family reaches out to</i>
<i> the only person they believe</i>

09:03.640 --> 09:08.310
<i>Is still in contact with him,</i>
<i>his financial adviser, dee dee.</i>

09:08.310 --> 09:11.540
We called dee dee to find out
where abraham was

09:11.550 --> 09:15.450
<i> And, um, she told us</i>
<i> that he went out of town.</i>

09:15.450 --> 09:18.590
She was receiving text from him
and she shared those texts

09:18.590 --> 09:23.190
<i> With his family to show</i>
<i> the family that he was okay.</i>

09:23.190 --> 09:26.930
He did mention
wanting to leave town.

09:26.930 --> 09:32.270
We wanted to help him
because everybody else dream

09:32.270 --> 09:34.700
He was trying to fulfill,

09:34.700 --> 09:37.000
And he never had time
for himself.

09:38.840 --> 09:44.340
Tammy:<i> And months went by,</i>
<i>months went by, and no abraham.</i>

09:44.350 --> 09:46.210
His phone wasn't going.

09:46.210 --> 09:50.420
It ring, ring, ring,
the answer service come on.

09:50.420 --> 09:52.490
<i> Cedric says,</i>
<i> "it just don't seem right.</i>

09:52.490 --> 09:54.950
I'm gonna report this."

09:54.960 --> 09:58.420
Narrator:<i> Seven months</i>
<i> after anyone last saw abraham,</i>

09:58.430 --> 10:02.630
<i> His cousin decides the family</i>
<i> has waited long enough.</i>

10:02.630 --> 10:07.300
David:<i> In November of 2009,</i>
<i> our missing persons unit</i>

10:07.300 --> 10:11.540
Took a call from a gentleman
named cedric edom.

10:11.540 --> 10:13.840
Cedric:<i> I said,</i>
<i> "listen, my cousin is missing.</i>

10:13.840 --> 10:15.410
I talk to him every day

10:15.410 --> 10:17.650
And he hasn't been
returning my call."

10:17.650 --> 10:20.580
David:<i> We reach out</i>
<i> to abraham's mother</i>

10:20.580 --> 10:22.450
<i> And find out</i>
<i> it was around April</i>

10:22.450 --> 10:26.820
That the last she actually
physically saw abraham.

10:26.820 --> 10:28.790
Narrator:<i> Since then,</i>
<i> she tells the detectives</i>

10:28.790 --> 10:31.920
<i> She's received only</i>
<i> text messages from her son.</i>

10:31.930 --> 10:35.530
<i> But they've left her</i>
<i> more troubled than comforted.</i>

10:35.530 --> 10:38.800
Some texts were telling her
that he was fine.

10:38.800 --> 10:40.670
He just don't wanna be bothered.

10:40.670 --> 10:43.670
<i> Abraham's mother told us,</i>
<i> "we're a little confused.</i>

10:43.670 --> 10:46.240
He can't text message
because he can't read or write."

10:47.740 --> 10:49.840
So we had to determine

10:49.850 --> 10:52.310
Were these text messages
legitimate?

10:52.310 --> 10:55.210
Was he with someone
that was actually

10:55.220 --> 10:57.020
Sending the text for him?

10:57.020 --> 11:01.590
We felt there was something
suspicious about the case.

11:01.590 --> 11:04.960
<i> This is more than</i>
<i> a missing person's case.</i>

11:04.960 --> 11:07.090
It was a missing person
involving

11:07.100 --> 11:10.700
A 30-plus-million-dollar-lottery
winner.

11:10.700 --> 11:13.030
Andrew:<i> Abraham was owed</i>
<i> money by lots of people,</i>

11:13.030 --> 11:16.100
So you have the potential
for people who owed him money

11:16.100 --> 11:18.770
<i> Or people</i>
<i> that wanted money from him</i>

11:18.770 --> 11:21.270
<i>Trying to hurt him in some way.</i>

11:21.280 --> 11:22.740
<i> Right from the beginning,</i>

11:22.750 --> 11:24.380
There are lots
of different suspects

11:24.380 --> 11:27.080
<i> And really no evidence</i>
<i> and no leads.</i>

11:30.590 --> 11:33.720
David:<i> Michael ford</i>
<i> filled a lawsuit and alleged</i>

11:33.720 --> 11:37.990
That abraham stole
the ticket from him.

11:37.990 --> 11:42.860
Andrew: If this wasn't abraham
who called, who was it?

11:42.860 --> 11:45.870
David: We want you
to record every conversation.

11:45.870 --> 11:49.200
Greg:<i> Let me see what we can do</i>
<i> to get you out of this</i>

11:49.200 --> 11:51.470
Because I know
you didn't kill him.

11:51.470 --> 11:54.480
David:<i> We get our binoculars</i>

11:54.480 --> 11:56.740
<i> We're just like, oh, my god.</i>

David:<i> We began</i>

12:20.770 --> 12:24.810
She was, uh, the last person
that we knew had seen him.

12:28.810 --> 12:32.710
Andrew:<i> Dee dee says</i>
<i> she's in touch with abraham.</i>

12:32.710 --> 12:34.980
Abraham just needed
some time away

12:34.980 --> 12:38.920
That he needed a break
from everything.

12:38.920 --> 12:40.990
David:
<i> Dee dee shows us her phone</i>

12:40.990 --> 12:45.190
Where she's been receiving
text message from abraham.

12:45.190 --> 12:48.690
And a text message back
from abraham saying,

12:48.700 --> 12:50.930
"I don't wanna be bothered."

12:50.930 --> 12:53.870
Narrator:<i> Dee dee also shows</i>
<i> investigators a video</i>

12:53.870 --> 12:58.540
<i> She made of a conversation</i>
<i> she had with abraham</i>
<i> a few months earlier,</i>

12:58.540 --> 13:01.740
<i> While discussing the book</i>
<i>she planned to write about him.</i>

13:01.740 --> 13:04.740
In this video,
she speaks to abraham and says,

13:04.750 --> 13:06.750
"are you tired of people
asking you for money?

13:06.750 --> 13:09.480
<i> Are you tired</i>
<i> of all the stress?"</i>

13:09.490 --> 13:12.420
<i> And abraham says,</i>
<i> "yeah, I just wanna get away."</i>

13:15.260 --> 13:17.890
<i> After our initial interview</i>
<i> with dee dee,</i>

13:17.890 --> 13:23.230
We started looking at everybody
that owed abraham money.

13:23.230 --> 13:26.630
<i> Once we learned the totality</i>
<i> of all the money</i>

13:26.630 --> 13:28.830
That abraham had loaned out,
given out,

13:28.840 --> 13:32.310
<i> People owing him money,</i>
<i> we had our hands full.</i>

13:32.310 --> 13:36.780
We had 20, 30 people
that we needed to talk to.

13:36.780 --> 13:40.180
We wanted to explore
every avenue we could.

13:44.920 --> 13:47.250
We learned
that approximately six months

13:47.260 --> 13:49.260
After abraham won the lottery,

13:49.260 --> 13:51.720
<i> Michael ford,</i>
<i> who bought the lottery ticket,</i>

13:51.730 --> 13:54.390
Gave it to abraham,
filed a lawsuit,

13:54.400 --> 13:56.130
And took abraham to court

13:56.130 --> 14:01.070
And alleged that abraham
stole the ticket from him.

14:01.070 --> 14:04.070
<i> That was investigated</i>
<i> and was settled in court.</i>

14:04.070 --> 14:06.540
<i> And it was determined</i>
<i> that michael ford</i>

14:06.540 --> 14:08.540
<i> Was not the owner</i>
<i> of the ticket,</i>

14:08.540 --> 14:11.140
That abraham
did give him the money

14:11.150 --> 14:13.350
And was the rightful owner
of the ticket.

14:15.550 --> 14:18.090
Narrator:<i> Investigators</i>
<i> recognized that losing out</i>

14:18.090 --> 14:21.490
<i> On $31 million</i>
<i> could cause michael ford</i>

14:21.490 --> 14:24.360
<i> To hold a grudge</i>
<i> against abraham.</i>

14:24.360 --> 14:27.430
Michael ford was actually
living in georgia.

14:27.430 --> 14:30.830
And we actually sent
a detective to georgia,

14:30.830 --> 14:33.570
<i> To speak with him in person.</i>

14:35.240 --> 14:38.640
<i> Michael ford, of course,</i>
<i> he admitted, yes,</i>

14:38.640 --> 14:41.270
We had a dispute
over the lottery ticket.

14:42.510 --> 14:44.040
<i> Of course, he's bitter.</i>

14:44.050 --> 14:45.910
He lost a lawsuit
against abraham

14:45.910 --> 14:47.980
Involving millions of dollars.

14:49.250 --> 14:51.320
<i> But michael ford said,</i>

14:51.320 --> 14:55.920
"I lost the dispute
and I accepted it.

14:55.920 --> 14:58.260
<i> And I'm not involved."</i>

15:01.400 --> 15:03.860
Narrator:<i> But the detectives</i>
<i> can't take his denial</i>

15:03.870 --> 15:05.470
<i> At face value,</i>

15:05.470 --> 15:08.200
<i> Not with a man's life</i>
<i> potentially at stake.</i>

15:08.200 --> 15:11.670
<i> So they dig deeper</i>
<i> into michael's background.</i>

15:11.670 --> 15:14.940
David: We actually went so far
as to pull phone records

15:14.940 --> 15:18.410
Of michael ford
to actually see where he was

15:18.410 --> 15:22.380
At the time that we believed
abraham he was last seen.

15:24.620 --> 15:25.890
Narrator:
<i> As investigators wait</i>

15:25.890 --> 15:27.620
<i> For michael ford's</i>
<i> phone records,</i>

15:27.620 --> 15:29.620
<i> The story</i>
<i> of the missing lottery winner</i>

15:29.630 --> 15:32.290
<i> Is splashed</i>
<i> across the headlines.</i>

15:32.290 --> 15:36.560
<i> The attention generates</i>
<i> no shortage of tips.</i>

15:36.570 --> 15:40.900
I mean, we got calls as far
as los angeles, california

15:40.900 --> 15:44.170
<i> From people that said</i>
<i> they saw abraham</i>

15:44.170 --> 15:47.240
In a cvs pharmacy.

15:47.240 --> 15:48.910
<i> They were so certain</i>
<i> it was him.</i>

15:48.910 --> 15:51.650
<i> We called the los angeles</i>
<i> county sheriff's office</i>

15:51.650 --> 15:54.580
And had someone
go pull the video

15:54.580 --> 15:58.450
From the day this person
said they saw him.

15:58.450 --> 16:01.720
<i> Once we saw the video,</i>
<i>we-- we knew it wasn't abraham.</i>

16:01.720 --> 16:03.860
You have to weed through,
is this true?

16:03.860 --> 16:05.320
Is this not true?

16:05.330 --> 16:08.330
And, you know,
you don't wanna miss the tip

16:08.330 --> 16:11.430
That's gonna break it.

David:<i> After looking</i>
<i> into his phone records,</i>

16:21.340 --> 16:25.280
We were able to determine
that michael ford was in georgia

16:25.280 --> 16:28.280
<i> At the time abraham</i>
<i> went missing,</i>

16:28.280 --> 16:30.150
And was not involved,

16:30.150 --> 16:33.290
And, um, was no longer
a suspect in the case.

16:35.420 --> 16:38.360
Narrator:<i> With no word</i>
<i> from abraham and no progress</i>

16:38.360 --> 16:41.590
<i> In the police search for him,</i>
<i> those closest to him,</i>

16:41.600 --> 16:46.300
<i> Including his mother,</i>
<i> elizabeth, find it hard</i>
<i> to hold on to hope.</i>

16:46.300 --> 16:49.000
He was always riding
around with different people,

16:49.000 --> 16:50.500
Pulling up the clubs.

16:50.510 --> 16:52.440
<i> Somebody could have robbed him</i>

16:52.440 --> 16:55.240
<i> Because he kept money</i>
<i> in his trunk.</i>

16:55.240 --> 16:57.240
It was well known
that he had a lot of money

16:57.250 --> 16:59.410
And he carried cash
around with him.

16:59.410 --> 17:01.280
<i> Anything was possible.</i>

<i> Then abraham's mother</i>
<i> receives an odd phone call.</i>

17:18.200 --> 17:21.270
Abraham's mother
was having lunch after christmas

17:21.270 --> 17:23.270
And she gets a call
from abraham.

17:27.680 --> 17:29.340

<i> And tells his mother</i>

Andrew:
<i> When she gets off the phone,</i>

17:36.080 --> 17:38.350
Abraham's mom realized something

17:38.350 --> 17:41.820
That it was not abraham
that she was talking with.

17:45.160 --> 17:48.490
Like any mother
who knows her son's voice,

17:48.500 --> 17:53.870
She knew that someone had called
pretending to be abraham.

17:53.870 --> 17:56.570
<i> And this is where</i>
<i> the plot thickens</i>

17:56.570 --> 17:59.640
With this strange call
to abraham's mother.

17:59.640 --> 18:02.980
<i>So that's where law enforcement</i>
<i> starts looking</i>

18:02.980 --> 18:06.380
With a one strong piece
of evidence they have.

18:06.380 --> 18:08.250
<i> And they're trying</i>
<i> to figure out</i>

18:08.250 --> 18:08.310

She says,
"well, it was a private number."

18:48.020 --> 18:49.420
<i> I met with my partner.</i>

But with this subpoena,
20 minutes later,

19:01.000 --> 19:02.670
Which is unheard of,

<i> It doesn't belong to abraham,</i>

19:18.620 --> 19:20.650
This phone is registered

19:45.280 --> 19:46.810
We stopped what we're doing.

19:46.810 --> 19:48.050
We jump in our car

19:48.050 --> 19:50.780
And we drive

19:50.790 --> 19:52.350
<i> It's the day after christmas.</i>

19:52.350 --> 19:54.490
<i> Thousands of cars there.</i>

19:54.490 --> 19:56.390
We pull in there and we parked,

19:56.390 --> 19:58.320
And we both looked at
each other like,

19:58.330 --> 20:01.030
"what are we gonna do?
What are we looking for?"

20:03.500 --> 20:05.760

Dee dee moore's car.

We just like, oh, my god,

20:23.680 --> 20:25.650
<i> She gets out of her car.</i>

20:27.050 --> 20:29.490
She gets in the passenger

20:31.190 --> 20:33.830
<i> We get our binoculars out,</i>

Dee dee hands this gentleman

20:46.710 --> 20:49.110
<i>She gets in her car and leaves.</i>

20:49.110 --> 20:51.780
So we're like,
let's follow him.

20:54.220 --> 20:56.180
<i> We cut the car off.</i>

20:56.180 --> 20:58.250
<i> I have my badge out.</i>
<i> I go,</i>

20:58.250 --> 21:01.390
"hey, I'm a homicide detective

21:01.390 --> 21:03.020
<i> We need to talk to you.</i>

21:03.020 --> 21:05.160

21:05.160 --> 21:07.190
<i> What do you wanna do?"</i>

21:07.200 --> 21:10.330
<i> So this gentleman says,</i>
<i> "I guess I'm gonna cooperate."</i>

21:10.330 --> 21:13.030
We identify him
as greg smith.

21:15.270 --> 21:18.900
<i> He's the one that made the</i>
<i>phone call to abraham's mother.</i>

21:24.380 --> 21:28.310
Greg: I say this,
"I made that telephone call.

21:28.320 --> 21:30.850
A lady paid me $5,000 to call

21:30.850 --> 21:34.650
And say I was
abraham shakespeare."

21:37.590 --> 21:40.190
I'm thinking abraham
don't wanna talk to her no more

21:40.190 --> 21:41.730
And she tried
to get in contact with him.

21:41.730 --> 21:43.660
Narrator:
<i> But investigators wonder</i>

21:43.660 --> 21:46.730
<i> Whether he's telling</i>
<i> the whole story.</i>

21:46.730 --> 21:49.130
We realized that
greg actually owes abraham

21:49.140 --> 21:50.900
Over a hundred
thousand dollars.

21:52.970 --> 21:54.870
<i>Greg was very suspicious to us.</i>

21:54.880 --> 21:58.680
So we sit and talk to greg
a little more.

21:58.680 --> 22:01.280
Narrator:<i> According to greg,</i>
<i> the plan was hatched</i>

22:01.280 --> 22:05.490
<i> When dee dee came to him</i>
<i> to collect on abraham's loan.</i>

22:05.490 --> 22:07.720
Dee dee was
putting pressure on him

22:07.720 --> 22:09.960
To pay this debt.

22:09.960 --> 22:12.830
<i> Then on the other hand,</i>
<i> she was offering money</i>

22:12.830 --> 22:14.960
To do these phone calls.

22:17.230 --> 22:18.670
<i> When we told greg</i>

22:18.670 --> 22:20.570
<i> That something was going on</i>
<i> with abraham,</i>

22:20.570 --> 22:22.900
He did genuinely
seem surprised.

22:22.900 --> 22:25.570
Greg:<i> He say,</i>
<i> "you made a telephone call</i>

22:25.570 --> 22:27.240
And impersonated
somebody else,"

22:27.240 --> 22:29.510
And that's all.

22:29.510 --> 22:32.580
Narrator:<i> The detectives have</i>
<i> nothing to charge greg with.</i>

22:32.580 --> 22:34.980
<i> So he's free to go home.</i>

22:34.980 --> 22:36.580
<i> But now they wanna know more</i>

22:36.580 --> 22:39.120
<i> About why dee dee</i>
<i> who everyone believes</i>

22:39.120 --> 22:43.320
<i> Has been helping abraham would</i>
<i> set up a phony phone call.</i>

22:43.320 --> 22:47.460
<i> They begin digging</i>
<i> into her background.</i>

22:47.460 --> 22:49.190
Law enforcement
quickly realized

22:49.200 --> 22:52.200
That dee dee did not have
a squeaky clean past.

22:52.200 --> 22:55.270
<i> Dee dee had been accused</i>
<i> of stealing</i>

22:55.270 --> 22:57.970
<i> From the business</i>
<i> that she worked.</i>

22:57.970 --> 23:01.170
David: A mysterious fire
in the office started

23:01.180 --> 23:03.310
Which burned all the records.

23:05.280 --> 23:07.810
<i> We also found</i>
<i> that she was arrested</i>

23:07.820 --> 23:09.210
<i> For insurance fraud</i>

23:09.220 --> 23:12.350
Where she claimed that
some guys carjacked her,

23:12.350 --> 23:13.990
Robbed her,
and tried to rape her,

23:13.990 --> 23:15.790
Threw her in the ditch
and stole her car.

23:19.290 --> 23:22.430
Narrator:<i> Given her past,</i>
<i> the detectives now consider</i>

23:22.430 --> 23:26.530
<i> A disturbing possibility,</i>
<i> rather than helping abraham,</i>

23:26.530 --> 23:30.440
<i> Was dee dee methodically</i>
<i> stealing from him?</i>

23:30.440 --> 23:32.040
<i> To help find the answer,</i>

23:32.040 --> 23:34.910
<i> The investigators go back</i>
<i> to greg smith</i>

23:34.910 --> 23:36.640
<i> And asked for help.</i>

23:36.640 --> 23:40.010
David:<i> We told greg we want you</i>
<i> to be part of our team.</i>

23:40.010 --> 23:42.750
We want you to continue
talking to dee dee,

23:42.750 --> 23:46.820
But we want you to record
every conversation.

23:48.660 --> 23:52.060
Greg: And he say,
"let's go meet with her

23:52.060 --> 23:53.660
And see what she got to say."

23:53.660 --> 23:55.390
I say, "serious, man,

23:55.400 --> 23:57.200
I ain't trying
to chase that woman."

23:57.200 --> 24:01.030
<i> But when authorities told me</i>
<i> he's a missing man,</i>

24:01.040 --> 24:02.870
I believe that.

24:02.870 --> 24:04.370
<i> So I said, "I tell you what,</i>

24:04.370 --> 24:07.210
What you need me to do
to help you out?"

24:07.210 --> 24:10.010
Andrew: So police ended up
wiring greg smith

24:10.010 --> 24:13.010
And sending him back out
to meet with dee dee moore.

24:16.420 --> 24:17.750
Greg:<i> I get the phone call,</i>

24:17.750 --> 24:19.620
<i> "hey, meet me</i>
<i> at the gas station."</i>

24:19.620 --> 24:22.090
So I said, "okay. It's on."

24:22.090 --> 24:24.160
David:<i> He says,</i>
<i> "if you want me to do this,</i>

24:24.160 --> 24:24.220

Narrator:<i> Eight months</i>

<i> His friend greg smith</i>

<i> And meeting with abraham's</i>

24:54.090 --> 24:55.520
David:<i> At this point,</i>

24:55.520 --> 24:58.690
That abraham might be
the victim of foul play

24:58.690 --> 25:01.630
And dee dee
is a suspect in the case.

25:01.630 --> 25:05.330
<i> So once we knew that greg</i>
<i> was in there with dee dee,</i>

25:05.330 --> 25:08.870
Our strategy was, okay,
let's put pressure on dee dee

25:08.870 --> 25:10.570
And see what happens.

Narrator:<i> Ready to start</i>

25:19.750 --> 25:21.150
Andrew:

25:21.150 --> 25:24.020
<i> Sitting in a empty can</i>
<i> of redbull.</i>

25:24.020 --> 25:26.390

Greg:<i> I reached dee dee,</i>

I say, "think you did

25:59.650 --> 26:02.650
<i> There is no evidence</i>

26:02.660 --> 26:06.390
But now police have her
red-handed,

26:06.390 --> 26:11.130
Offering money to help cover up
abraham's disappearance.

26:12.730 --> 26:14.800
Narrator:<i> Dee dee's</i>
<i> incriminating statements</i>

26:14.800 --> 26:17.540
<i> Give the detectives</i>

<i> To do a deeper</i>

26:23.580 --> 26:25.080
David:<i> We sent out subpoenas</i>

26:27.550 --> 26:28.880
Prior to April 7th,

26:28.880 --> 26:33.250
Abraham averaged 200 calls

26:35.060 --> 26:39.690
And the only communication
he has after April 7th

26:39.690 --> 26:41.390
Is with dee dee moore.

The cell phone towers

26:54.840 --> 26:57.040
That his alleged texts

As where dee dee moore
was at the time.

27:02.450 --> 27:04.650
David:<i> It became evident</i>
<i> at that point</i>

27:04.650 --> 27:07.250
That unless they're sitting
in the car next to each other,

27:07.260 --> 27:08.920
Texting each other,

27:08.920 --> 27:10.920
Dee dee has abraham's phone.

<i> Of dee dee's involvement</i>

<i> Or worse before they can</i>

Greg:<i> I reached dee dee,</i>

I know you didn't
kill him.

27:55.440 --> 27:56.570
What happened?

And let me see
what we can do

27:58.310 --> 28:00.240
To get you out of this

28:00.240 --> 28:02.640
Because I know

28:23.660 --> 28:26.400
David: And dee dee without

<i> Greg smith sets up</i>

28:37.480 --> 28:39.880

28:39.880 --> 28:42.550
<i> An undercover cop</i>

28:42.550 --> 28:45.020
<i> Who poses as greg's cousin.</i>

Greg: Me and mike,

28:47.420 --> 28:50.890
David:<i> We set it up</i>

28:50.890 --> 28:53.090
Greg pulls up with mike smith.

They get in dee dee's car.

I can't get a hold of him.

<i> So, mike starts pressing her.</i>

29:06.510 --> 29:08.240
You know, "what do you mean?
You think something,

29:08.240 --> 29:10.240
Either something happened
to him or didn't?"

29:11.980 --> 29:15.050
In that conversation,
she finally admits that

29:15.050 --> 29:17.320
She believes abraham's dead.

29:27.330 --> 29:29.430
That abraham shakespeare
was dead.

29:29.430 --> 29:31.400
He could have been missing
and this was all just

29:31.400 --> 29:34.170
A cover up
for him being gone.

29:35.470 --> 29:39.540
David: And mike says,
"well, he's dead.

29:39.540 --> 29:41.270
I'll take the murder rap."

29:41.280 --> 29:44.280
<i> He says, "I want $50,000.</i>

29:44.280 --> 29:48.210
But if you want me to do this,
I need the body."

29:48.220 --> 29:50.020
Andrew:
<i> The undercover is saying,</i>

29:50.020 --> 29:51.750
"for my story to law enforcement

29:51.750 --> 29:55.220
To be credible if I'm going
to confess to this crime,

29:55.220 --> 29:57.290
I need to know details."

29:57.290 --> 29:59.390
<i> Dee dee tells the undercover.</i>

29:59.390 --> 30:02.560
She can identify
where the body is.

30:03.470 --> 30:05.500
<i> And that abraham was killed</i>

30:05.500 --> 30:08.700
With a 38 caliber
smith & wesson revolver,

30:21.450 --> 30:23.180
"hey, meet me

<i> I gotta be on my guards</i>

30:48.340 --> 30:50.940
<i> That abraham shakespeare</i>

30:50.940 --> 30:52.540

30:52.550 --> 30:54.610
And she knows
where the body is buried.

30:59.620 --> 31:02.760
David: She takes greg smith
to plant city

31:02.760 --> 31:04.490
Off of highway 60,

31:04.490 --> 31:07.430
<i> Where we had identified</i>
<i> a house</i>

31:07.430 --> 31:09.430
That she had
purchased out there.

Greg:<i> When we pull up</i>
<i> to that house,</i>

31:13.470 --> 31:15.640

"I'm gonna get out the car

And I'm gonna show you
exactly where the body is."

31:22.710 --> 31:26.510
David:<i> She walks him to</i>
<i> the very far back of the house</i>

31:26.510 --> 31:31.120
And there's a concrete slab
back there.

31:31.120 --> 31:33.590
<i> And she takes a piece</i>
<i> of angle iron,</i>

31:33.590 --> 31:36.120
<i> Sticks it in the ground,</i>

31:36.120 --> 31:38.120
<i> And whispers to greg,</i>

31:38.130 --> 31:40.660
"tell your boy to dig
six feet down

31:40.660 --> 31:42.490
And you'll find
abraham's body."

31:47.470 --> 31:50.540
Andrew: And dee dee
actually hands greg smith

31:50.540 --> 31:53.070
A smith & wesson
38 caliber revolver.

31:55.380 --> 31:57.210
David:<i> She says,</i>

<i> That was used to kill abraham.</i>

31:58.950 --> 32:01.610
I was able to get it from
the person that killed abraham."

32:05.090 --> 32:06.720
The first thing we do

32:06.720 --> 32:09.550
Is we secure a search warrant
for that property.

32:09.560 --> 32:11.790
<i> We need the body.</i>

<i> Just outside</i>

<i> Abraham's hometown.</i>

32:27.770 --> 32:31.040
David:<i> When the sun came up,</i>
<i> we began digging.</i>

32:31.050 --> 32:33.710
The first part
we had to break apart

32:33.720 --> 32:36.250
A 30 by 30 concrete slab.

32:36.250 --> 32:38.720
<i> As we're breaking apart</i>
<i> the concrete slab,</i>

32:38.720 --> 32:40.790
<i> We have to look</i>
<i> for any evidence</i>

32:40.790 --> 32:43.690
And then we begin
layer by layer

32:43.690 --> 32:45.690
Taking the dirt away.

32:45.690 --> 32:47.930
<i> We're putting in a sifter,</i>

32:47.930 --> 32:49.460
<i> Looking for any evidence,</i>

32:49.460 --> 32:51.930
<i> And another layer</i>
<i> and another layer.</i>

32:51.930 --> 32:54.700
<i> So the first day, nothing.</i>

32:55.970 --> 32:58.400
<i> The second day,</i>
<i> we continue</i>

32:58.410 --> 33:00.540
<i> And still we have nothing.</i>

33:00.540 --> 33:02.340
<i> So some of us were like,</i>

33:02.340 --> 33:06.880
Have we been spoofed again
by dee dee moore?

33:06.880 --> 33:08.280
<i> And then about an hour later,</i>

33:08.280 --> 33:10.820
One of the crime scene
technicians says,

33:10.820 --> 33:12.290
"I think I got something."

33:13.890 --> 33:16.560
Andrew:<i> They find</i>

Of a human who they believed
to be abraham shakespeare.

33:23.630 --> 33:26.360
David: The body still had
dreads in place.

33:26.370 --> 33:29.770
Abraham was most known
for his long dreadlocks.

33:32.770 --> 33:35.640
The medical examiner
was able to examine

33:35.640 --> 33:37.080
Abraham's body.

33:37.080 --> 33:39.250
<i> The body had decomposed badly</i>

33:39.250 --> 33:42.880
To the point where it was
almost difficult for them

33:42.880 --> 33:47.790
To determine some of
the evidence around it.

33:47.790 --> 33:50.060
<i> There were bullets found.</i>

33:50.060 --> 33:53.290
The other thing was that
the clothes they found him in

33:53.290 --> 33:56.200
<i> Were the same clothes he was</i>

34:00.100 --> 34:02.800
And without a doubt,
it was abraham.

34:07.280 --> 34:09.140
I attended the autopsy
of abraham

34:09.140 --> 34:12.010
<i> And it was determined</i>
<i> that abraham died</i>

34:12.010 --> 34:13.850
Of two gunshot wounds.

34:20.760 --> 34:23.020
After we dug
abraham's body up,

34:23.020 --> 34:26.890
I drove to where
abraham's mother worked.

34:26.890 --> 34:31.500
<i> I had to tell her that</i>
<i> we had found a body.</i>

34:31.500 --> 34:33.870
I told her, "it's your son."

34:37.200 --> 34:40.310
That is one the hardest things
I've had to do.

34:46.510 --> 34:50.050
Tammy:<i> When we found out</i>
<i> abraham was buried</i>

34:50.050 --> 34:52.950
Up on a slab
in the backyard,

34:52.950 --> 34:55.320
It's just devastating

34:55.320 --> 34:56.590
And I couldn't take it.

34:56.590 --> 34:59.320
I mean, you know,
it was just too--

34:59.330 --> 35:01.130
Too sad.

35:01.130 --> 35:03.030
It was just too sad.

35:04.530 --> 35:06.060
Greg:<i> He didn't steal nothing.</i>

35:06.070 --> 35:08.070
<i> He didn't take nothing.</i>

35:08.070 --> 35:11.000
He literally won the lottery

35:11.010 --> 35:14.940
And he had to pay his life
for what was his.

35:18.080 --> 35:20.750

Andrew:<i> At this point</i>
<i> of the investigation,</i>

36:07.460 --> 36:10.190
Dee dee is the one that knows
where the body is buried.

36:10.200 --> 36:12.200
She's the one
who knows about the gun,

36:12.200 --> 36:14.700
But there's nothing
actually connecting her

36:14.700 --> 36:17.570
To the murder
of abraham shakespeare.

36:17.570 --> 36:19.540
Narrator:<i> Though</i>
<i> she led them to the body,</i>

36:19.540 --> 36:22.870
<i> If investigators can't prove</i>
<i> she pulled the trigger,</i>

36:22.880 --> 36:25.280
<i> Dee dee moore could walk.</i>

<i> They run ballistics tests</i>

<i> Dee dee handed to greg smith,</i>

<i> Hoping that they might provide</i>
<i> the connection they need.</i>

36:34.850 --> 36:38.320
Andrew: The police cannot
determine definitively

36:38.320 --> 36:42.490
That the bullets used to kill
abraham had come from that gun.

36:42.500 --> 36:46.770
<i> Law enforcement knew</i>
<i> without any eye witnesses</i>
<i> to the murder,</i>

36:46.770 --> 36:50.200
Without any compelling
physical evidence,

36:50.200 --> 36:52.300
They have to build
strong cases they can

36:52.310 --> 36:55.670
On the circumstantial evidence.

36:55.680 --> 36:57.310
Narrator:
<i> Investigators dig deeper</i>

36:57.310 --> 36:59.580
<i> Into all of dee dee's</i>
<i> relationships</i>

36:59.580 --> 37:01.650
<i> In a quest</i>
<i> to connect her further</i>

37:01.650 --> 37:03.720
<i> To the crime scene.</i>

37:03.720 --> 37:07.150
We go to dee dee moore's
ex-husband house

37:07.160 --> 37:09.050
<i> And we asked him,</i>

37:09.060 --> 37:10.790
"what do you know
about the property

37:10.790 --> 37:12.390
That she had there?"

37:12.390 --> 37:14.930
<i> And he said,</i>
<i> "I went out there</i>

37:14.930 --> 37:17.530
<i> Sometime around April</i>

37:17.530 --> 37:21.070
And she asked me
to dig a hole for her."

37:21.070 --> 37:23.740
<i>So he dug the hole and he said,</i>

37:23.740 --> 37:25.340
"when the sun
went down that day,"

37:25.340 --> 37:27.570
He said he went back
and he filled in the hole,

37:29.340 --> 37:31.940
And he's like, "all I remember
is it looked like

37:31.950 --> 37:34.480
It was full of concrete
and trees and brush,

37:34.480 --> 37:38.420
<i> But it was dark and I just</i>
<i> pushed the dirt over it."</i>

37:38.420 --> 37:41.520
She ended up building
the concrete slab over it

37:41.520 --> 37:44.460
<i> And parked</i>
<i> the motorhome on it.</i>

37:44.460 --> 37:46.560
He didn't know anything
about abraham.

37:46.560 --> 37:48.690
He had never even met abraham.

<i> But then as planning</i>

37:57.800 --> 38:01.370
<i> She makes a startling claim</i>
<i> that she is a victim</i>

38:01.370 --> 38:05.210
<i> Of a crime herself</i>
<i> and desperately needs help.</i>

38:10.920 --> 38:12.380
Dee dee tells law enforcement

38:12.390 --> 38:14.450
That abraham was killed

38:14.450 --> 38:17.260
In a drug dispute
with a man named ron watson.

38:18.730 --> 38:21.660
<i> And that ron watson</i>
<i> threatened dee dee</i>

38:21.660 --> 38:24.130
And said that he would kill her

38:24.130 --> 38:27.570
And kill her family

Our prosecutor told the jury,

40:48.040 --> 40:51.610
This was a crime
motivated by pure greed.

40:51.610 --> 40:54.350
Greed that transformed
into evil.

<i> Dee dee moore dug a deep hole,</i>

About $10,000 left in his name.

<i> Dee dee was living large</i>
