26:03.812 --> 26:05.939
Look, my thing is,
I don't want something
stupid to happen...

26:05.939 --> 26:09.150
before it has a chance
to get straightened out,
okay?

26:09.150 --> 26:13.572
Okay. I'll stay away from him
for a few days.

26:19.369 --> 26:22.914
You tell me Neil
died unnaturally,
I say I'm uninvolved.

26:22.914 --> 26:25.792
-That's your story.
-It's God's truth.

26:25.792 --> 26:28.169
Yeah? Well, we know you're
lying, and that makes you
a murder suspect.

26:28.169 --> 26:29.296
What are you talking about?

26:29.296 --> 26:32.424
Look, we not only know
that someone fractured
Rutledge's skull--

26:32.424 --> 26:35.010
We know whose prints came off
that Cold Duck bottle, Tommy.

26:35.010 --> 26:37.596
We were all three of us
drinking from that bottle.

26:37.596 --> 26:40.557
How it looks now, Tommy,
you're gonna get charged
with this homicide.

26:40.557 --> 26:45.437
You're gonna draw some beat-up
legal aid lawyer couldn't
get a walk for St. Francis.

26:45.437 --> 26:49.899
Now, if your pal Arnie
was the bad guy, you gotta
get in front of that fast.

26:49.899 --> 26:54.571
What must've happened,
Neil must've fell on the stairs
and hit his head,

26:54.571 --> 26:56.823
and come back up
and lay down and died.

26:56.823 --> 26:59.451
The more crap you make up,
the more I figure
it's you that did it.

26:59.451 --> 27:01.995
Nobody can walk even a step
with a head injury like that.

27:01.995 --> 27:05.123
We got his prints.
I'm ready to charge this guy.
Come on.

27:05.123 --> 27:08.001
- Come on. Get up. Get up!
- No, no, no!
I'm gonna give you Arnie!

27:11.379 --> 27:14.883
Th-There was a big stink
over money.

27:14.883 --> 27:17.594
Neil still had some left,
but he wouldn't make
another buy.

27:17.594 --> 27:20.472
He wanted to go to work,
and Arnie wanted to
keep bingeing.

27:20.472 --> 27:25.268
So... we were gonna tie
him up and rob him.

27:25.268 --> 27:27.020
It was Arnie's idea.

27:27.020 --> 27:31.232
Only Arnie turns out to be
scared of him, so he hits him
with the Cold Duck bottle.

27:31.232 --> 27:34.653
It just knocked Neil
on his knees, and he didn't
seem that out of it.

27:34.653 --> 27:39.199
So Arnie just let go
with this big swing,
and it was just too much.

27:41.034 --> 27:43.536
God. Arnie's so stupid,
you wouldn't believe it.

27:45.038 --> 27:47.248
So, here's
what he gets me in.

27:47.248 --> 27:51.002
Yeah, you're
a real hard-luck guy.
Come on.

27:58.468 --> 28:00.095
Sit down, Panetti.

28:00.095 --> 28:03.515
Over here?

28:03.515 --> 28:06.851
-Getting ready for the big day?
-What? The trial?

28:08.478 --> 28:11.314
I just want to get
my named cleared.
That's it.

28:11.314 --> 28:16.069
-Frankie Pisciotta
buy you these clothes?
-No. I paid for 'em.

28:16.069 --> 28:20.073
Yeah, these days, you're
probably the best-paid busboy
in America, huh, Jerry?

28:20.073 --> 28:23.493
Is Frank Pisciotta
a stand-up? Yes.

28:23.493 --> 28:26.287
What the hell
are you guys looking to do,
make a crime of that too?

28:26.287 --> 28:28.665
SIPOWICZ:
Jerry, we're looking to take
the dice out of your hands.

28:28.665 --> 28:31.000
Where "A,"
you're found guilty,

28:31.000 --> 28:34.295
or either one night Frankie
puts four lines extra
up his nose...

28:34.295 --> 28:38.133
and he decides that
you and Paul Bellini'd
look better in a ditch.

28:38.133 --> 28:39.342
It's not gonna happen.

28:39.342 --> 28:42.303
Jerry, say,
"It's not gonna happen,
I don't think," okay?

28:42.303 --> 28:44.723
Otherwise, you
sound like a moron.

28:44.723 --> 28:47.726
Do these clothes look like
Frankie don't look out for us?

28:47.726 --> 28:52.522
All right, here's
a little quiz for you, Jerry.
Where are they now? You ready?

28:52.522 --> 28:55.400
Where's Sammy "The Bull"
Gravano, present time?

28:55.400 --> 28:58.695
I wish I knew.
Gotti would send me
a million bucks from prison.

28:58.695 --> 29:02.323
So, the answer
to the category,
"Where are they now?"

29:02.323 --> 29:05.118
You don't know
where The Bull is.
Correct, Jerry?

29:05.118 --> 29:06.119
Correct is correct.

29:06.119 --> 29:09.706
Whereas John Gotti,
you know his exact location.

29:09.706 --> 29:11.708
Yeah, he's in the joint.

29:11.708 --> 29:15.712
Because Gotti rolled the dice,
and The Bull
took the sure thing.

29:15.712 --> 29:19.048
Gotti got convicted, which
you're eligible to get too.

29:19.048 --> 29:21.342
And Gravano,
that gave him up,

29:21.342 --> 29:27.390
he's sunbathing with some broad
on a beach somewheres and nobody
knows where the hell it is.

29:27.390 --> 29:29.976
Jerry, you gotta ask yourself,

29:29.976 --> 29:34.147
are you ever gonna be safe
from one day Frank Pisciotta
deciding,

29:34.147 --> 29:37.358
"You know, there are
two guys out there
that can put me away...

29:37.358 --> 29:40.153
just like
The Bull put Gotti away.

29:40.153 --> 29:43.072
Now, these two guys,
they're better off lying
dead somewhere...

29:43.072 --> 29:47.368
in a ditch with
their heads beaten in,
covered up with lye."

29:47.368 --> 29:50.914
Yeah, that's a situation
that you don't need to buy
no new wardrobes.

29:53.541 --> 29:56.961
-This is a conspiracy,
what you guys're doing.
-Jerry!

29:56.961 --> 30:01.424
The Bull did 18 murders
he admits to, and
he's kicking back on a beach...

30:01.424 --> 30:04.803
'cause he had what
the government wants
more than they want him.

30:04.803 --> 30:08.807
You know how much more
the government wants Pisciotta
than you, Jerry?

30:08.807 --> 30:11.810
You know what kind of deal
they'd give you
in Witness Protection?

30:11.810 --> 30:15.772
The "A" deal, Jerry.
A Gravano-type deal.

30:15.772 --> 30:17.106
Otherwise,
you roll the dice.

30:17.106 --> 30:20.610
Does the jury convict you
or wait for Pisciotta
to beat your head in?

30:25.782 --> 30:31.287
They'd write a deal out,
theoretically?
Chapter and verse?

30:31.287 --> 30:33.581
A Gravano-type deal.

30:36.626 --> 30:40.129
I'd tell you
what I'd demand--

30:40.129 --> 30:43.258
Gravano's type of deal,
word for word.

30:43.258 --> 30:45.051
But I'm not saying
I'm going for it.

30:45.051 --> 30:48.847
-How could they say no?
-He's got fistfuls of their
short hairs in either hand.

expression in my work.

A long time, my painting's
been inferential-- define things
by what they're not.

what happens next.

38:35.104 --> 38:36.314
Hey, Andy.

38:36.314 --> 38:38.399
-I got a sitter.
-Thanks, man.

38:48.492 --> 38:50.119
COMMISSIONER:
To the rank of
detective second grade,

38:50.119 --> 38:53.122
Third Grade Detective
Louis Annunziato.

38:57.335 --> 38:58.669
Congratulations.

39:07.762 --> 39:11.640
We have one promotion to
a rank some people consider
the most prestigious...

39:11.640 --> 39:14.143
and difficult to achieve
in the department...

39:14.143 --> 39:17.521
and symbolic of its highest
traditions and standards.

39:17.521 --> 39:21.901
To first grade detective,
Detective Second Grade
Bobby Simone.

39:30.534 --> 39:32.161
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

39:42.755 --> 39:46.926
Ladies and gentleman,
this concludes our promotion
ceremony. Thank you for coming.

39:58.729 --> 40:01.357
(no audible dialogue)

40:17.957 --> 40:19.959
(knocking)

40:39.520 --> 40:42.148
-Hey.
-Hi.

40:50.823 --> 40:53.909
-Give me your coat?
-No. I don't know, um--

40:57.621 --> 41:00.416
I'm so scared.

41:00.416 --> 41:01.333
About what?

41:06.797 --> 41:11.010
Wind used to scare me,
snow coming out of the dark.

41:15.055 --> 41:20.352
Friday nights in high school,
my dad'd be working up
his weekend bender,

41:20.352 --> 41:24.690
going off on my mom and Dougie,
making me his pretty pet.

41:26.650 --> 41:32.031
After supper, I'd-I'd get out of
there and walk back to school
for the hockey game.

41:35.284 --> 41:37.745
My leather jacket
wasn't warm enough,

41:39.788 --> 41:43.459
but I wouldn't wear anything
covered up my figure.

41:43.459 --> 41:46.420
You want something warm now?

41:46.420 --> 41:47.630
I can make you some tea.

41:47.630 --> 41:50.049
-No.
-No? Why not?

41:52.134 --> 41:53.135
Okay.

42:01.644 --> 42:03.312
How did Andy seem?

42:03.312 --> 42:07.107
What do you mean?

42:07.107 --> 42:08.484
He didn't ride you home?

42:08.484 --> 42:11.320
Um, he seemed okay.

42:11.320 --> 42:13.113
Why? What was the matter?

42:13.113 --> 42:15.699
Matter?
(scoffs)

42:15.699 --> 42:18.744
I got promoted,
and he didn't.

42:18.744 --> 42:21.080
He's got a license
to be pissed off.

42:21.080 --> 42:26.210
Well, Andy's got to know
he's an orphan
off his time drinking.

42:32.299 --> 42:36.554
I realize, with Liery,
you were trying to help me.

42:38.973 --> 42:40.182
Yeah.

42:43.394 --> 42:46.021
I cry for you every day.

42:46.021 --> 42:49.066
I don't know why
I couldn't say yes.

42:52.361 --> 42:54.029
(sighs)

42:56.198 --> 42:59.868
At the, um--

42:59.868 --> 43:03.247
At the hockey rink,
we all stood on the benches
through the whole game.

43:05.165 --> 43:07.084
The boys
had crushes on me and--

43:08.961 --> 43:11.046
Walking home, I-I--

43:15.175 --> 43:20.264
always felt like
I could never stop
being cold.

43:23.892 --> 43:25.686
You just needed
a warmer coat.

43:25.686 --> 43:29.398
(sighs, sniffles)
I couldn't put one on.

43:31.025 --> 43:33.902
I was afraid to
cover up my figure.

43:33.902 --> 43:37.114
I thought--

43:37.114 --> 43:39.783
I thought
I was always just
gonna be cold.

43:43.954 --> 43:45.748
(sighs)

43:45.748 --> 43:50.836
(sniffles)
You make me warm,
and I couldn't make you happy.

43:53.547 --> 43:55.633
You made me happy.

43:55.633 --> 43:59.261
I couldn't say yes.
I wanted to, and I couldn't.

43:59.261 --> 44:01.055
It's okay, Diane.

44:01.055 --> 44:05.893
I didn't know I could love
anybody like this and then--
Not to be able to say yes.

44:08.187 --> 44:09.563
(whistling)

44:15.235 --> 44:17.363
You want this?

44:17.363 --> 44:18.489
Yeah.

44:20.366 --> 44:22.117
See? That wasn't so hard.

44:25.663 --> 44:27.456
(whistling continues)

44:39.635 --> 44:42.638
