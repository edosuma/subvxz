00:06.381 --> 00:09.592
Man... is Dad about to die?

00:11.094 --> 00:13.930
- I knew something was going on.
- What do you mean you knew?

00:14.597 --> 00:16.808
- I had an idea.
- And you didn't tell me?

00:17.475 --> 00:18.560
Good morning.

00:18.935 --> 00:22.230
Yo, when were you gonna tell us
you were dying? We saw your video.

00:23.314 --> 00:25.066
What? I'm not dying.

00:25.275 --> 00:28.194
- Dad, I didn't tell him anything.
- Mom, what's going on?

00:28.528 --> 00:31.531
- Did you know about this?
- About your father's health? Yes.

00:32.115 --> 00:34.784
About this video?  No.

00:35.368 --> 00:36.870
I thought there were no secrets
in this house.

00:37.203 --> 00:38.663
Dad needs a kidney transplant.

00:38.830 --> 00:43.418
I said I may need a kidney transplant,
and y'all weren't supposed to see that.

00:44.044 --> 00:46.254
Okay, look. Your father's health
is not the best right now,

00:46.254 --> 00:47.464
but he is not dying.

00:48.256 --> 00:51.426
'Kay? We're gonna do
everything we can. Okay?

00:51.801 --> 00:55.221
Gonna do more exercising
and better eating. Right, Chuck?

00:55.472 --> 01:00.894
Exactly. Starting right now at breakfast.
And one thing I never wanna do...

01:02.103 --> 01:04.272
is let down the team, all right?

01:04.981 --> 01:06.733
I'm gonna do everything that I can
to make sure

01:06.733 --> 01:09.069
- that this net stays together...
- Hmm.

01:09.069 --> 01:10.278
<i>Heroes are big and strong.</i>

01:10.403 --> 01:12.072
- ...tight.
<i>They leap and soar.</i>

01:12.197 --> 01:14.741
<i>But when the lights go down,
they're just people.</i>

01:15.033 --> 01:17.994
<i>They breathe. They laugh.
They cry. They hurt.</i>

01:18.244 --> 01:19.454
- Hey.
<i>They die.</i>

01:19.746 --> 01:21.623
<i>- The thing about heroes is...</i>
- It's all right.

01:21.623 --> 01:22.749
<i>...they're just like you.</i>

01:35.637 --> 01:37.388
- He doesn't even look sick.

01:37.764 --> 01:40.558
- It just feels... unreal.

01:41.184 --> 01:42.268
- Yeah.

01:42.393 --> 01:44.312
My aunt had heart problems
couple years back.

01:45.021 --> 01:49.651
She's crushing it now, though.
Running marathons, swimming, hiking...

01:50.860 --> 01:52.153
dead lifts 325.

01:54.447 --> 01:56.741
Three hundred and twenty-five? Pounds?

01:57.158 --> 01:59.327
 I'm just seeing
if you're paying attention.

02:00.453 --> 02:04.958
Look, Filthy... if anyone can beat this,
it's Coach.

02:09.087 --> 02:14.134
You're right. And maybe us getting
into Beacon is just the medicine he needs.

02:28.273 --> 02:31.901
Look at those kicks... Aniq Hale.

02:32.152 --> 02:35.655
ESPN Top Ten, High School All-American.

02:35.822 --> 02:38.950
He has offers from, like,
every major in the country.

02:39.993 --> 02:42.579
He's like a mix of Kobe and Curry.

02:43.288 --> 02:46.916
- Straight dirty.
- Averages 25 points per game for Beacon?

02:47.876 --> 02:51.171
- I know, Filthy. You tell us every week.
- Right.

02:53.089 --> 02:55.758
- Still can't believe he has those kicks.
- Man, he's wild.

02:58.011 --> 03:01.264
Is he walking towards us?

03:03.183 --> 03:07.145
Josh Bell, right?
Heard about that comeback. Nice game, yo.

03:07.770 --> 03:10.356
- Thanks. It's Filthy.
- Filthy, huh?

03:11.357 --> 03:13.401
As in Chuck "Da Man" Bell's kid.

03:14.277 --> 03:17.405
- First round draft picks.
- Five time all-star. We know the man.

03:18.823 --> 03:22.285
- Let's see if your skills match your name.
- Say less.

03:26.915 --> 03:27.957
Hold this for me.

03:33.630 --> 03:34.672
Let's go.

03:37.133 --> 03:40.136
Come now, Filth. That's all you got?

03:40.637 --> 03:45.058
You're supposed to be the man.
Come on now. What about "Da Man" Bell?

03:53.066 --> 03:54.150
Ooh...

03:55.443 --> 03:56.527
How are those ankles?

03:58.613 --> 04:01.783
All right. You clean with it.
Coach Howard ain't lying.

04:02.825 --> 04:05.453
Young buck might be coming
to play with us next year.

04:06.829 --> 04:08.122
But do you got range, Filthy?

04:17.465 --> 04:20.218
- Y’all should come through tonight.
- At the Roll Call?

04:20.510 --> 04:23.054
Every Saturday night. Beacon After Dark.

04:23.513 --> 04:27.141
- We skate, bowl... and we eat good.

04:27.141 --> 04:31.229
And don't forget the girls.
After Dark, baby.

04:31.896 --> 04:34.315
Sounds good.
Me and the squad will slide through.

04:34.565 --> 04:37.735
All right then, wodie. Pull up.
Bring big man here too.

04:37.986 --> 04:40.113
- Get some squad if you want to.
-  All right.

04:44.409 --> 04:46.035
You just snapped Aniq's ankles.

04:46.035 --> 04:48.913
Dad is gonna freak when he hears
that I talked to Aniq Hale.

04:48.913 --> 04:52.292
For sho. And after tonight,
there is no doubt Aniq will vouch for us.

04:52.500 --> 04:54.127
- Beacon, here we come.
For real.

04:54.377 --> 04:56.838
Come on, let's get it. Come on...

05:08.224 --> 05:10.643
- I promise I'll clean it soon.
Mm-hmm.

05:12.145 --> 05:13.855
I wanted to talk to you
about your assignment.

05:13.855 --> 05:17.317
Mom, I can explain.
Filthy was just trying to help me out.

05:17.442 --> 05:19.277
He wanted to make sure
I could go to the party and...

05:19.277 --> 05:20.570
He told me this morning.

05:20.903 --> 05:23.489
As much as I love you all finishing
each other's sentences,

05:23.865 --> 05:26.326
finishing each other's essays
is called plagiarizing.

05:27.035 --> 05:29.662
- There will be consequences.
- It won't happen again.

05:29.787 --> 05:30.830
Oh, I know it won't.

05:31.289 --> 05:34.208
And you'll have plenty of time to think
about it in after-school study hall

05:34.208 --> 05:37.420
for the next two weeks. No more shortcuts.

05:38.087 --> 05:39.839
Now, I noticed you've been
a bit more productive

05:39.839 --> 05:41.257
since we've gone to the doctor.

05:42.592 --> 05:46.220
You were right. I shouldn't have tried
to stop taking my meds cold turkey.

05:46.637 --> 05:47.764
It was messing with my head.

05:48.014 --> 05:50.808
Baby, it is nothing wrong with taking
a little bit of extra help.

05:51.809 --> 05:52.852
I'm proud of you.

05:55.813 --> 05:58.483
Oh! You're really being productive.

05:58.691 --> 06:00.568
- Oh!
- Can I see?

06:00.568 --> 06:03.905
- No. No previews. It's not ready yet.
- Okay.

06:04.280 --> 06:07.492
I'm just glad you understand it's okay
to have more than one passion.

06:08.201 --> 06:10.244
Yeah, but I might be better at basketball.

06:10.244 --> 06:13.498
- That's okay. It's not a competition.

06:13.873 --> 06:16.626
It's just about what's in here
and letting life do the rest.

06:16.959 --> 06:20.213
Your father and I will be here
for the unveiling when it's ready.

06:20.963 --> 06:26.177
- Thanks, Mom. For everything.
- I love what you're doing.

06:27.887 --> 06:32.350
Hey, Mom. Be honest. Is Dad gonna be okay?

06:34.685 --> 06:37.939
He is. There's a few lifestyle changes
he needs to make.

06:39.565 --> 06:41.067
Baby, your dad is strong.

06:42.527 --> 06:46.155
And sometimes real strength
is letting others shoulder the burden.

06:47.156 --> 06:50.034
That's what we gotta do.
He needs that tonight.

06:50.618 --> 06:53.496
- You mean the anniversary?
- Fifteen years.

06:54.622 --> 06:57.834
Fifteen long years.

07:10.138 --> 07:13.516
Chuck... let's go!

07:13.724 --> 07:15.017
Mama!

07:15.351 --> 07:17.145
What'd I tell you about yelling
in my house?

07:17.395 --> 07:18.771
Weren't you just yelling in your house?

07:18.771 --> 07:20.648
See, here we go again
with these double standards.

07:20.648 --> 07:24.402
- Mm. Whatever. Hey, Vondie.
- Dr. Bell!

07:24.861 --> 07:28.322
- You definitely understood the assignment.
- Mm... Did I?

07:28.948 --> 07:30.783
- Chill, that's my mom.
Hey.

07:32.285 --> 07:34.787
My dear sweet mother...

07:36.122 --> 07:38.583
we were initially gonna hang around
here tonight,

07:38.749 --> 07:41.961
but I fear that we need
to get out more, you know?

07:42.170 --> 07:45.256
Do some different things,
other than playing ball all the time.

07:45.590 --> 07:46.924
What do you want, child?

07:48.468 --> 07:51.262
- Dad, guess who I met today.
Hmm.

07:51.971 --> 07:55.683
Aniq Hale. And he's gonna need
a podiatrist the way I crossed him up.

07:55.892 --> 07:58.019
- It was nasty.
- The Aniq Hale?

07:58.144 --> 07:59.770
- Yes, sir.
- Beacon's golden child?

07:59.770 --> 08:03.941
Exactly why I need your permission to go
to the Roll Call tonight.

08:04.400 --> 08:05.693
Get some more face time with Aniq.

08:07.278 --> 08:10.072
Was there some secret family meeting
I don't know about?

08:10.907 --> 08:13.284
Shouldn't y'all be gone by now?

08:13.284 --> 08:15.369
Nah, there's no family meeting.

08:15.369 --> 08:18.247
Your brother wants to go hang out
with the boys from Beacon

08:18.247 --> 08:19.332
and go to the Roll Call.

08:19.332 --> 08:22.043
But if y'all keep asking,
we may be staying.

08:22.168 --> 08:24.921
Mm-hmm?
- No, I didn't even mean it like that.

08:24.921 --> 08:26.672
Mm.
- I'm just saying I want y'all to have

08:26.797 --> 08:28.591
a lot of fun 'cause it's your anniversary.

08:28.591 --> 08:35.097
<i>Mm-hmm? Fifteen... beautiful years.</i>

08:35.223 --> 08:38.643
- You mean long years.

08:39.143 --> 08:41.729
Can y'all keep
the romantic stuff to yourselves?

08:41.979 --> 08:44.524
- How do you think you two got here?

08:44.524 --> 08:45.775
Chill on that, Mom.

08:46.400 --> 08:48.402
Are all you guys
going skating tonight?

08:48.402 --> 08:49.570
- Yes.
- No.

08:49.737 --> 08:52.740
What he means to say
is not all of us are skating.

08:53.115 --> 08:54.617
Some of us wanna bowl too.

08:54.784 --> 08:56.661
Mm.
- It's convivial.

08:56.661 --> 09:03.668
As in "jovial," as in "festive."
As in a bunch of joyfulness.

09:04.001 --> 09:07.463
Well, y'all know what I'm going to say
'cause your dad was the king of bounce!

09:07.463 --> 09:09.090
- Oh, please.

09:09.090 --> 09:11.259
Chuck, why are you lying
to these boys?

09:11.259 --> 09:13.844
- Why?
- Dad, you are a trip.

09:13.970 --> 09:16.180
- So, can we go?

09:17.306 --> 09:21.018
- Hmm... Leave together, return together.
- Let's go!

09:21.435 --> 09:23.729
Back by 10:00. No excuses.

09:23.896 --> 09:27.233
- No excuses.
- Mm-hmm. Tell Aniq I said what's up.

09:29.026 --> 09:32.572
You know, with the three of y'all
at Beacon, sure championship.

09:32.822 --> 09:33.823
Sir.

09:33.823 --> 09:35.449
- Thanks, Dad.
Chuck, let's go!

09:35.449 --> 09:36.534
- Have fun.
- Bye.

09:39.870 --> 09:42.248
See, this is exactly
what I'm talking about, man.

09:42.707 --> 09:45.501
Just like with Dad's video,
all you care about is you and your time.

09:45.835 --> 09:46.961
Look, JB, it's not even...

09:46.961 --> 09:49.547
Nah! Did you even consider
that I might have plans, too?

09:50.172 --> 09:51.591
Alexis was supposed to come over, so we...

09:51.591 --> 09:55.303
Oh, I get it.
You wanted a little alone time.

09:55.678 --> 09:58.306
A little kissy wissy. It's all good, bro.

09:59.015 --> 10:02.018
Look, I'm not saying that you and Alexis
cannot spend time together.

10:02.018 --> 10:04.729
All I'm saying is, look at it
from a different angle.

10:05.396 --> 10:12.278
You got couple's skating, dim lights,
slow music and waffle fries.

10:13.279 --> 10:15.656
Come on. That sound like
an opportunity to me.

10:17.325 --> 10:19.410
- All right. I'll see what she says.

10:20.244 --> 10:23.998
You gonna thank me later.
Not all Filthy's ideas are bad ideas.

10:24.248 --> 10:26.125
- Just most of 'em.

10:26.584 --> 10:30.504
All right. Follow me, gentlemen.
Beacon and our roller skates await.

10:31.047 --> 10:32.423
Waffle fries on me!

10:43.351 --> 10:47.897
Mm-mm.
- Mr. Romance.

10:48.189 --> 10:50.858
That's right, baby. The night is young.
We're just getting started.

10:54.528 --> 10:58.324
- How you feeling?
- I told you I am fine.

10:59.325 --> 11:01.118
Besides the fact that I am dying.

11:02.578 --> 11:05.790
- That's not funny, Chuck.
- Come on, babe. It's a little funny.

11:06.207 --> 11:08.042
We can't lose our humor.

11:08.918 --> 11:12.296
Tonight, we just breathe, relax.

11:14.256 --> 11:15.424
Tonight's our night.

11:16.759 --> 11:18.636
- First one in a long time, too.
- Mm-hmm.

11:22.848 --> 11:24.642
Remember our first Mardi Gras out here?

11:26.394 --> 11:29.063
I mean, I never seen anybody clean up
so many beads.

11:29.605 --> 11:34.610
You were the definition of bling-bling.
You got beads over here, beads over there.

11:34.610 --> 11:36.862
Yeah, that was Keisha Jones.

11:38.656 --> 11:39.740
- Remember?
- Uh...

11:39.740 --> 11:42.660
That was the summer you almost lost
the best thing you ever had.

11:44.412 --> 11:45.705
- Babe, come...

12:08.769 --> 12:11.856
You sure you guys don't wanna bowl first?
I'm not breaking my neck on the rink.

12:12.523 --> 12:14.984
Be cool, fondue. We in here.

12:23.743 --> 12:27.121
- So, this is high school?
- Definitely leveling up.

12:27.705 --> 12:29.623
Then why'd you grab
your Hughes sweatshirt?

12:29.999 --> 12:33.753
Oh, well, it's my last chance to rep it
before I'm dripped down in Beacon gear.

12:38.716 --> 12:41.927
I didn't think high school would have
this much tongue kissing. I can't wait!

12:42.428 --> 12:44.263
- Is that glitter in their mouth?
- Yo.

12:48.684 --> 12:50.227
- Yeah, I'm gonna get a ten.
- What's up, Alexis?

12:50.227 --> 12:51.812
- Hey!
- Heard your boy Zuma

12:51.812 --> 12:55.775
- might be here tonight.
- He's not my boy, and he's a friend.

12:56.192 --> 12:59.111
And for the hundredth time,
I was trying to do the right thing, okay?

13:00.237 --> 13:01.238
Turn the page, dude.

13:03.365 --> 13:05.951
- Are they always like this?
- Yup.

13:07.036 --> 13:08.412
- Got it.
- Yo.

13:09.246 --> 13:10.414
I know we all came here together,

13:10.831 --> 13:12.833
but do you wanna head out a little early,
just you and me?

13:12.833 --> 13:17.129
Are you kidding me? This is amazing.
It's been forever since I've been skating.

13:18.672 --> 13:19.965
All right. Showtime.

13:25.054 --> 13:26.806
Can I start you off
with anything to drink?

13:27.097 --> 13:28.182
- Wine.
- Old fashioned.

13:29.308 --> 13:31.560
Wine for me. Water for him.

13:32.102 --> 13:34.104
And you know what?
We'll both do the grilled salmon.

13:39.068 --> 13:44.573
- What's this? Punishment for Keisha?
-  Lifestyle changes, remember?

13:45.825 --> 13:48.702
The only sugar you're allowed
to have are these lips.

13:48.953 --> 13:49.954
Uh-huh?

13:50.329 --> 13:53.541
It's funny you should say that
'cause I got a sweet tooth.

13:53.541 --> 13:55.417
- Oh. Do you?
- Yeah, baby.

13:55.543 --> 13:57.711
- Got anything that can help me out?

13:57.878 --> 14:01.006
I don't know. Maybe. I don't know
if it's gonna be sweet enough.

14:02.216 --> 14:03.259
Try me.

14:13.352 --> 14:15.980
You know, I know we're not talking
about the elephant in the room tonight.

14:18.315 --> 14:20.651
I don't even wanna think
about what I'd do without you.

14:23.320 --> 14:25.197
Hey, you never have to, okay?

14:26.949 --> 14:28.951
I'm not going anywhere.

14:38.961 --> 14:41.088
- What are you doing?
- Girl, you know.

14:41.297 --> 14:43.632
- I'm showing off.

14:50.639 --> 14:53.017
Look, I will do whatever it takes.

14:53.726 --> 14:58.355
I will take any vitamin...
and I will do any yoga routine.

14:58.731 --> 15:00.983
- Even the one that makes me gassy.

15:02.568 --> 15:05.613
Please don't do anything
that makes you more gassy.

15:05.779 --> 15:07.489
- Hmm.
- For all our sakes.

15:10.284 --> 15:11.493
- See?

15:11.869 --> 15:14.163
Like that. Look at you.

15:17.374 --> 15:19.752
I'd go for bowling.
Last time I skated, I broke my...

15:19.752 --> 15:20.920
Yo, it's them.

15:22.129 --> 15:24.632
- Filthy in the house.
- What's up, my dude?

15:24.757 --> 15:26.759
Hey, you remember I was telling you
about my brother, right?

15:26.884 --> 15:28.427
- Oh, what's up, dude?
How you doing, man?

15:28.594 --> 15:31.138
I'm glad y'all came through. Let's get it.

15:31.639 --> 15:32.681
Let's go!

15:53.994 --> 15:55.537
- Yeah!

16:12.388 --> 16:13.472
Man.

16:15.891 --> 16:19.979
Shawty's cute. Who is she?
I ain't see her around.

16:21.188 --> 16:23.857
Think she came here with your boy Filthy
and his clique.

16:24.483 --> 16:25.859
Oh. Word?

16:27.569 --> 16:30.072
Yo, I didn't know y'all skate
like this every Saturday.

16:31.323 --> 16:33.117
Why don't you introduce me
to your girl over there?

16:38.247 --> 16:41.083
Oh, Alexis? Yeah, nah, that's...
that's JB's girl.

16:41.333 --> 16:42.960
They just started talking,
like, a few weeks ago.

16:42.960 --> 16:44.086
It's nothing too serious.

16:44.920 --> 16:46.922
I hear that. Good for him.

16:47.214 --> 16:51.468
Yeah. Alexis is good peeps,
but I don't know what she sees in JB.

16:56.890 --> 17:00.644
Tell you one thing,
shawty ain't leaving without my number.

17:21.373 --> 17:22.458
About time.

17:23.208 --> 17:24.501
- Here you go.
- All right.

17:25.002 --> 17:26.503
Who's ready to catch a bowling fade?

17:26.628 --> 17:28.922
- Let's do it.
- All right, I got us in lane four so...

17:29.089 --> 17:30.257
-  Let's go.
- Let's go.

17:30.382 --> 17:32.092
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
I'll meet y'all there.

17:32.301 --> 17:33.302
All right.

17:42.311 --> 17:45.731
Alexis, right? I saw your moves.

17:45.856 --> 17:48.734
I know this ain't your first time.
The name's Aniq.

17:49.151 --> 17:52.112
I've heard of you.
Pretty much all of New Orleans has.

17:52.112 --> 17:53.530
I'll take that as a compliment.

17:53.781 --> 17:55.491
- You ride up at Beacon next year?

17:56.617 --> 17:59.578
Maybe. It depends.
Was thinking of going to City Arts.

18:00.871 --> 18:04.958
Well, hopefully, after tonight...
you change your mind.

18:07.544 --> 18:09.713
- Come on. Let's chill.

18:09.880 --> 18:11.131
Hey, what is he doing?

18:11.548 --> 18:13.550
Aniq knows that you
and Alexis are talking.

18:14.718 --> 18:15.719
He don't care.

18:15.886 --> 18:18.639
Beacon varsity, they're all used to
getting whatever they want.

18:18.764 --> 18:21.016
You know, none of this would've happened
if you hadn't changed plans.

18:21.016 --> 18:24.853
So what? This is on me now?
I didn't make Alexis talk to Aniq.

18:25.104 --> 18:26.313
You don't get it, man.

18:26.563 --> 18:28.774
We had a good thing going and instead,
you made tonight about you.

18:29.108 --> 18:33.028
About me? Bro, this is about us.
Us getting the upper hand in Beacon.

18:33.195 --> 18:34.446
Would you stop with Beacon?

18:36.115 --> 18:38.742
This is so whack, man.
I knew we shouldn't have come here.

18:39.868 --> 18:44.414
<i>Calamity,
as in an unexpected, undesirable event.</i>

18:51.421 --> 18:52.422
Yes!

18:53.006 --> 18:55.217
Hey, Filth,
why don't you go talk to Maya?

18:56.677 --> 18:59.680
Come on, Filth. She's had a crush on you
since first grade.

19:02.599 --> 19:04.518
Look, Vondie, I don't know what they put
in that Slurpee,

19:04.518 --> 19:05.978
but Maya's like a sister to me.

19:09.189 --> 19:12.901
Have you ever thought that maybe
she brought Zuma to make you a little...

19:12.901 --> 19:14.903
- Little what?
- Jealous?

19:14.903 --> 19:18.365
You need to put the drink down.

19:19.116 --> 19:21.952
- Your brain is frozen for real, fammy.

19:23.287 --> 19:24.329
Just letting you know.

19:35.132 --> 19:37.134
Hey, everything okay?

19:38.719 --> 19:42.097
Sorry. Comes in waves.

19:43.432 --> 19:46.685
Sometimes our future is all
I can think about, and sometimes I...

19:46.977 --> 19:48.395
What? You forget the reality?

19:49.730 --> 19:51.940
Maybe you should consider reaching out
to Kelli.

19:54.109 --> 19:55.903
She is still family after all.

19:57.070 --> 19:58.822
Hmm. Kelli...

20:01.116 --> 20:02.618
You think that's a good idea?

20:04.369 --> 20:07.080
Baby, I just don't want you to rule anyone
or anything out.

20:09.166 --> 20:10.626
You do realize that...

20:14.046 --> 20:16.340
you're asking me to open
the Pandora's box.

20:17.132 --> 20:19.218
- I know.
- Here you go. Plates are hot.

20:21.261 --> 20:22.304
Thank you.

20:25.265 --> 20:28.727
Can we save this conversation for later?

20:29.061 --> 20:31.521
You know, and instead toast
to our anniversary?

20:34.900 --> 20:36.652
I'll raise my glass to that.

20:43.992 --> 20:46.286
- Hey.

20:46.620 --> 20:47.621
You done bowling?

20:48.622 --> 20:49.665
And I'm getting hangry.

20:49.957 --> 20:50.999
Mm.

20:58.590 --> 20:59.758
Look, Maya.

20:59.758 --> 21:03.220
I know that these past few months
haven't exactly been easy,

21:03.220 --> 21:07.015
and I know we haven't really talked
since the dance with Zuma,

21:08.016 --> 21:12.688
but I really wanna say that I totally
and I completely forgive you.

21:12.938 --> 21:18.277
- Pause. You forgive me?
-  I'm kidding.

21:18.694 --> 21:20.779
Look, what I really mean to say
is that I'm sorry.

21:21.446 --> 21:24.241
Three! Order's up!
- Vondie told you to come over here, huh?

21:24.366 --> 21:28.704
- Nah. But he is tripping.
- What do you mean?

21:31.331 --> 21:35.419
Nothing at all. And again,
I really am sorry. So, are we good?

21:36.837 --> 21:40.257
Nah. Not until you get us
these waffle fries you promised us.

21:40.549 --> 21:43.176
-  Oh, say less. I got you.

21:44.303 --> 21:45.512
Can I hold four dollars?

21:46.221 --> 21:48.390
- I'm not about to play with you.

21:49.141 --> 21:52.185
- So, you gonna let me get that IG?
- I'll think about it.

21:55.188 --> 21:56.189
Let's go back.

22:05.407 --> 22:06.908
- Yeah!

22:06.908 --> 22:07.993
Hey, y'all.

22:08.577 --> 22:11.288
Did y'all have a good chat?
Seems like you were enjoying yourself.

22:11.997 --> 22:14.166
Is that shade? Why are you tripping?

22:15.083 --> 22:16.501
Hit you all in your feelings?

22:17.336 --> 22:19.755
Thought you said
it wasn't serious.

22:20.630 --> 22:22.257
- Yo, what is he talking about?
- I...

22:22.632 --> 22:24.634
Filthy told us
y'all wasn't really that serious.

22:25.469 --> 22:26.595
Let me talk to you.

22:31.266 --> 22:34.311
I should've never invited y'all.
You ain't ready for Beacon After Dark.

22:34.895 --> 22:38.482
No matter who you or your dad is.
Dusty old career.

22:41.026 --> 22:43.945
The Man? More like The Big Bust Man.

22:45.655 --> 22:48.533
- Yo, say another thing about my dad.

22:49.034 --> 22:50.035
I ain't Zuma.

22:50.327 --> 22:52.704
- Trust me, you don't want this smoke.
- Maybe I do.

22:53.205 --> 22:56.333
'Cause one thing you not about to do
is disrespect my family and my crew.

22:57.125 --> 22:58.919
- Man, if you don't step back...
Hey.

22:58.919 --> 23:01.046
Stop playing!
- Putting your hands on me, bro?

23:02.255 --> 23:04.716
- Hey, what are you guys doing? Stop!
If you keep throwing

23:04.841 --> 23:06.385
those hands,
I'm gonna have to call security.

23:06.593 --> 23:09.179
Get off him! Get off him!

23:09.179 --> 23:11.348
- Wait! What's going on? Stop! Stop!

23:11.890 --> 23:15.977
Stop recording! Stop!
- They're gonna get us kicked out, stop!

23:15.977 --> 23:18.105
- Hey, back up. Back up.
- What you doing?

23:18.105 --> 23:21.191
- Hey, hey, chill out, bro. Calm down.
- Cut it out!

23:21.566 --> 23:24.027
What's going on? Get off him!
Stop playing!

23:26.696 --> 23:29.866
- You gotta get off him! Stop!
- Yeah!

23:36.206 --> 23:37.874
Ain’t no fighting in the Roll Call!

23:42.462 --> 23:44.464
Um... I needed this.

23:45.340 --> 23:47.175
- Hmm.

23:50.011 --> 23:51.054
Hmm.

23:52.431 --> 23:53.432
Hello?

23:53.640 --> 23:56.059
<i>Your boys were involved
in a fight at the Roll Call.</i>

23:57.227 --> 23:59.855
<i>If you don't pick them up,
I'm gonna call the police.</i>

24:00.188 --> 24:03.233
No, sir. No, don't call the police.

24:04.526 --> 24:06.153
Yep, we'll be there in 15 minutes.

24:06.319 --> 24:08.280
- What? What happened?
- It's the boys.

24:08.697 --> 24:10.407
<i>Be careful hanging
with your heroes,</i>

24:10.615 --> 24:13.243
<i>following in their footsteps,
trying to be who you're not.</i>

24:13.869 --> 24:14.995
<i>It never ends well.</i>

24:21.626 --> 24:24.421
This is what you wanted, right?
To be the center of attention?

24:24.880 --> 24:26.006
Well, now everybody's looking.

24:26.173 --> 24:28.133
Yo, I was trying to help you get
some face time, all right?

24:28.133 --> 24:30.886
Nobody needs your help, man.
Stop trying to help, all right?

24:31.178 --> 24:33.305
If it's not about the paper,
it's about getting into Beacon.

24:33.638 --> 24:35.432
When will you learn to just focus
on your own life?

24:35.932 --> 24:38.268
- Aniq better not have told Coach Howard.
Are you kidding me?

24:38.768 --> 24:40.520
- Is that all you think about?
- Could you be quiet?

24:41.104 --> 24:42.814
You're always talking about
what I'm doing wrong.

24:42.814 --> 24:44.941
Where was this energy
when Aniq was hugged up on Alexis?

24:44.941 --> 24:46.318
- What'd you say?
- Yeah, you heard me!

24:46.318 --> 24:47.402
Hey, hey. Enough!

24:47.569 --> 24:49.863
If your name ain't Miles Davis,
I don't wanna hear another sound

24:50.030 --> 24:51.031
until we get home.

25:07.380 --> 25:09.299
Have y'all lost your mind?

25:09.466 --> 25:10.967
We did not raise you like this.

25:11.134 --> 25:14.846
- Dad, he was talking trash about you.
- I don't care who was talking to who.

25:15.347 --> 25:18.517
People talk. You can't control them,
but you can control yourselves

25:18.517 --> 25:20.477
both on and off the court.

25:20.644 --> 25:23.480
I'm sorry. I didn't mean for it
to go down like that.

25:23.605 --> 25:28.276
You are two Black boys in America.
That call your mother and I got?

25:28.568 --> 25:30.153
That could have gone a lot differently.

25:30.487 --> 25:33.573
What happened? I don't wanna hear
nothing about no game.

25:34.616 --> 25:36.243
Life is about pressure.

25:36.660 --> 25:39.412
High school, the next level.
That's about pressure, son.

25:40.038 --> 25:43.708
LeBron, Kobe, those guys are masters
of handling pressure.

25:44.668 --> 25:47.671
We gonna spend some time,
you mastering your emotions,

25:47.879 --> 25:49.172
and that's how you get character.

25:50.465 --> 25:54.261
You're grounded. No friends,
no video games, no going out.

25:54.469 --> 25:56.096
- Wait. What'd I do?
- Dad, you weren't even there.

25:56.096 --> 25:57.222
- You don't get it.
- Hey.

25:57.389 --> 25:58.431
- Hey.
- Upstairs.

26:00.517 --> 26:01.518
Now.

26:11.403 --> 26:12.696
It never gets easy, huh?

26:14.239 --> 26:15.448
Happy anniversary.
