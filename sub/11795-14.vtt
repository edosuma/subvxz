00:02.035 --> 00:03.636
( bell rings )

00:03.670 --> 00:06.939
<i>* When I wake up in the</i>
<i>morning and the alarm</i>
<i>gives out a warning</i>

00:06.973 --> 00:09.876
   <i>* I don't think</i>
   <i>I'll ever make it on time</i>

00:09.909 --> 00:12.812
 <i>* By the time I grab my books</i>
 <i>and I give myself a look</i>

00:12.846 --> 00:16.383
  <i>* I'm at the corner</i>

00:16.416 --> 00:19.953
 <i>* It's all right</i>
 <i>'Cause I'm saved by the bell</i>

00:21.988 --> 00:24.991
  <i>* If the teacher pops a test</i>

00:25.025 --> 00:27.961

00:58.758 --> 01:02.662
<i>* It's all right</i>
<i>'Cause I'm saved by the bell *</i>

01:16.309 --> 01:19.579
 I got here soon as I could.
 What's Kelly's big emergency?

01:19.612 --> 01:21.481
 That's what we're
 waiting to find out.

01:21.514 --> 01:23.583
  Yeah, she called
  all of us.

01:23.616 --> 01:25.919
   Screech, didn't you
   forget something?

01:25.952 --> 01:29.255
Of course. I forgot to make
my lizard a fly omelet.

01:30.890 --> 01:33.827
 Screech, I think you
 forgot your clothes.

01:33.860 --> 01:37.330
 Lisa,
 I didn't want you to see me
 this way until our honeymoon.

01:38.832 --> 01:39.866
  Don't look!

01:39.899 --> 01:42.769
 Don't worry.

01:42.802 --> 01:45.739
   Hey, Kelly. Why'd you want
   us all to meet you here?

01:45.772 --> 01:47.440
  Yeah, what's
  the big emergency?

01:47.474 --> 01:48.975
   Billy is.

01:49.009 --> 01:52.712
Aw. But why'd you bring
your baby brother here?

01:52.746 --> 01:54.848
   My parents got snowed in
   at the ski lodge.

01:54.881 --> 01:57.450
 I gotta babysit Billy
 till they come home.

01:57.484 --> 01:59.919
 But they're
 taking the cheerleading
 pictures during first period.

01:59.953 --> 02:02.055
- That's the emergency.
- You're right.

02:02.055 --> 02:06.393
 How's he going to learn
 all those cheers when he
 can't even talk yet?

02:06.426 --> 02:09.362
I was hoping you guys could
watch him while I
go for my picture.

02:09.395 --> 02:12.599
- Please, please, please?
- Come on,
ask me something easy,

02:12.632 --> 02:15.669
 like making sure he grows up
 in a nuclear-free environment.

02:15.702 --> 02:17.470
   I don't know the first thing
   about babies.

02:17.504 --> 02:20.907
 I do. They always spit up
 on expensive clothes.

02:20.940 --> 02:25.512
I'll babysit him.
I've raised four
salamanders and a toad.

02:25.545 --> 02:28.615
  Now you just need someone
  to babysit Screech.

02:28.648 --> 02:31.985
  - Kelly, we'll all watch him.
  Come on.
  - You guys are great.

02:32.085 --> 02:34.287
 Now here's his formula,
 diapers, baby wipes,

02:34.320 --> 02:36.790
   pacifier, bottles
   and extra cotton.

02:36.823 --> 02:39.826
What's the cotton for?

02:39.859 --> 02:43.797
 For your ears when Billy
 starts screaming. Hi, sweetie.

02:43.830 --> 02:47.934
  Well, I guess you guys
  have fun. Gotta go.

02:47.967 --> 02:51.638
 Zack,
 I can't take care of Billy.
 I've got a test first period.

02:54.641 --> 02:56.743
   I gotta go home
   and get duded up.

02:58.611 --> 03:00.380
 Gee, sweetie,
 I'd love to take care of you,

03:00.413 --> 03:01.748
  but this dress
  isn't paid for yet.

03:01.781 --> 03:03.950
 Unkie Slater will have
 to take care of you.

03:06.419 --> 03:09.289
   Well, I guess it's just you,
   me and a baby, huh?

03:09.322 --> 03:10.824
  - It's just you, Preppie.
  - Huh-uh, come on.

03:10.857 --> 03:13.426
- I've got a geometry quiz.
- No. Huh-uh.

03:16.796 --> 03:19.499
   Well, looks like
   I'm a single parent, huh?

03:23.737 --> 03:25.572
  Shh, quiet.

03:28.074 --> 03:29.776
 Hi, Zack. Do you have
 the baby in the bag?

03:29.809 --> 03:31.911
  Shh, quiet.

03:31.945 --> 03:33.747
Why, is Billy sleeping?

03:33.780 --> 03:36.750
 No, you pinhead.
 I just don't want
 anybody to know he's in here.

03:36.783 --> 03:39.486
 Too late, dipstick.
 You already told me.

03:40.453 --> 03:42.889
  Oh.
  ( mutters softly )

03:42.922 --> 03:46.493
 - What? I can't hear you.
 - What are you
 doing with the baby?!

03:48.928 --> 03:50.764
I've got to find Kelly.

03:50.797 --> 03:53.667
   They must've taken
   the cheerleaders'
   pictures by now.

03:53.700 --> 03:57.470
   PA: <i>Your attention, please.</i>
   <i>This is your principal, Mr.</i>
   <i>Belding.</i>

03:57.504 --> 04:00.206
  <i>Yearbook</i>
  <i>pictures are being taken</i>
  <i>in the library.</i>

04:00.240 --> 04:03.810
Chess Club,
it's your move.

04:03.843 --> 04:07.547
  Insect Club,
  you go in five minutes,
  so stop bugging me.

04:09.416 --> 04:11.317
 That's me, Zack.
 I gotta fly.

04:11.351 --> 04:13.853
   - Oh, Screech, wait!
   - ( Baby cries )

04:13.887 --> 04:16.523
 Well, Billy,
 I guess it's just us.

04:16.555 --> 04:18.458
 Aw, come on,
 go easy on me, okay?

04:18.491 --> 04:21.761
  I don't know
  much about babies,
  I'm an only child.

04:21.795 --> 04:23.530
( bell rings )

04:23.563 --> 04:25.732
 Oh, no, French class.

04:25.765 --> 04:28.968
  Look, whatever you do,
  don't go <i>"oui, oui",</i> okay?

04:35.575 --> 04:38.678
( bell rings )

04:38.712 --> 04:41.581
  Now, students,
  we will soon begin

04:41.614 --> 04:44.751
  the oral examination.
  Is everyone ready?

04:44.784 --> 04:47.754
( Billy cries )

04:47.787 --> 04:50.924
<i>Monsieur</i> Morris, something
you wish to
share with the class?

04:50.957 --> 04:52.826
( Billy cries )

04:56.296 --> 04:59.666
 Uh... wa-ah!

04:59.699 --> 05:04.504
 I'm just so
 excited to be taking
 this French quiz today. Wa-ah!

05:04.537 --> 05:07.307
 Zackie, you make
 such a good example.

05:07.340 --> 05:10.210
   Now just a petite review
   before the quiz.

05:10.243 --> 05:12.779
Remember your
pronunciation.

05:12.812 --> 05:15.348
   The R in English

05:15.382 --> 05:18.952
  is the arr-rr
 <i>en francais.</i>

05:19.052 --> 05:20.687
( Billy coos )

05:22.589 --> 05:24.657
 Who said that?
 Who?

05:24.691 --> 05:27.494
( Billy coos )

05:27.527 --> 05:30.497
  Zackie, was that you who made
  the R so <i>perfectement?</i>

05:30.530 --> 05:32.065
( Billy coos )

05:33.333 --> 05:34.634
  <i>Exactement!</i>

05:34.668 --> 05:37.070
   And you barely
   moved your lips.

05:37.070 --> 05:40.640
 Now, everyone,
 do and say just like Zackie.

05:40.674 --> 05:42.942
( Billy coos )

05:42.976 --> 05:44.778
   ( students mimic Billy )

05:44.811 --> 05:47.280
( Billy cries )

05:47.313 --> 05:49.482
  ( mimicking Billy )

05:49.516 --> 05:52.919
  Wait <i>un moment</i>,
  that is not a French sound.

05:52.952 --> 05:56.423
( Billy cries )

05:56.456 --> 05:59.526
  ( mimicking Billy )

05:59.559 --> 06:01.494
  Students, students!

06:01.528 --> 06:04.631
   ( Billy crying )

06:04.664 --> 06:08.568
  ( mimicking Billy )

06:08.601 --> 06:11.037
- Kelly did what?
- All: Kelly did what?

06:11.037 --> 06:13.940
  Uh, emergency.
  I gotta go.

06:14.040 --> 06:16.343
  All:
  Uh, emergency. I gotta go.

06:16.376 --> 06:18.778
Teacher: Class, where
are you going?

06:23.049 --> 06:26.086
 Kelly sure picked a great time
 to break her arm.
 Yes, she did.

06:26.119 --> 06:29.122
Guess those
are the breaks.

06:29.155 --> 06:31.124
  We don't know when she'll
  be back from the hospital,

06:31.157 --> 06:33.526
   so the best
   thing to do is leave
   the baby with the nurse.

06:33.560 --> 06:37.097
   Freddie Kruger's mother?
   Huh-uh. No way.

06:37.130 --> 06:39.132
  Okay, we'll leave him
  with Belding then.

06:39.165 --> 06:41.501
But Billy's too young
to go to
the principal's office.

06:41.534 --> 06:44.904
   Yeah, besides,
   Kelly asked us to
   take care of him.

06:44.938 --> 06:46.106
  We're the ones she trusts.

06:46.139 --> 06:47.907
Zack, you're not being
reasonable about this.

06:47.941 --> 06:50.076
  She's right, Zack.
  We do have to go to class.

06:50.110 --> 06:51.811
You do what
you have to do,

06:51.845 --> 06:54.881
  but I'm not going
  to shirk my responsibility.

06:54.914 --> 06:56.583
  You really care
  about this baby don't you?

06:56.616 --> 06:59.886
Yeah.
Hey, we're pals, okay?

06:59.919 --> 07:01.287
We speak
the same language. Huh?

07:01.321 --> 07:03.356
   ( Billy giggles )

07:03.390 --> 07:06.026
  PA: <i>Attention, please.</i>
 <i>This is Mr. Belding.</i>

07:06.026 --> 07:08.028
( Billy cries )

07:08.028 --> 07:11.231
  We feel the same way, kid.

07:11.264 --> 07:13.166
  Spirit Squad
  meets on the field.

07:13.199 --> 07:15.769
  Go team!
  And go now.

07:17.470 --> 07:19.939
   Bye, Billy,
   we got to split.

07:26.346 --> 07:28.048
 Say ''cheeseburger,''
 Mr. Belding.

07:28.081 --> 07:29.949
Cheeseburger.
But I didn't order one.

07:30.050 --> 07:31.317
   What are you doing here?

07:31.351 --> 07:34.554
The yearbook staff asked me
to be their photographer.
It's my hobby.

07:34.587 --> 07:36.856
  Well, it's nice of you
  to volunteer, Max.

07:36.890 --> 07:39.826
  Who said anything
  about volunteering?

07:39.859 --> 07:41.895
  You guys are
  paying me a bundle.

07:43.063 --> 07:44.364
Smile.

07:44.397 --> 07:46.466
  Well, wait a minute,
  Max, wait a minute.

07:46.499 --> 07:48.835
   If you're on the payroll,

07:48.868 --> 07:51.071
  I want a portrait
  for Mrs. B.

07:54.374 --> 07:55.542
 Say ''medium rare.''

07:55.575 --> 07:57.243
 Medium rare.

08:00.013 --> 08:02.048
You gotta be on the field
for the track pictures.

08:02.082 --> 08:05.885
  I know. But I'm going to have
  to find some
  way to hide Billy.

08:05.919 --> 08:08.421
 I'll watch him for you
 when I get back from my
   wrestling pictures.

08:08.455 --> 08:11.024
  - Oh, thanks.
  - ( Billy crying )

08:12.125 --> 08:13.893
 Aww, what's the matter
 with him?

08:13.927 --> 08:15.362
   I don't know.
   He just does that a lot.

08:15.395 --> 08:17.831
 Maybe he's hungry
 or something.

08:19.332 --> 08:22.035
I've got a Ding Dong
in my gym bag.

08:22.035 --> 08:24.304
Babies don't eat
Ding Dongs, ding-dong.

08:24.337 --> 08:26.206
  Maybe he's thirsty.

08:26.239 --> 08:29.809
No sweat.
I have a can of
root beer, too.

08:29.843 --> 08:31.811
 I don't know,
 maybe he needs to be burped.

08:32.412 --> 08:34.381
  Or changed?

08:36.383 --> 08:39.919
Both: Changed!

08:39.953 --> 08:43.056
 Put him down on the bench
 here. I've seen this
 done a million times.

08:43.056 --> 08:45.558
   - What do we do first?
   - First we lay him down.

08:45.592 --> 08:47.327
  Then we get our umbrellas,

08:47.360 --> 08:50.864
  'cause we don't want
  to be given a baby shower.

08:52.932 --> 08:54.300
   Freshman.

08:55.535 --> 08:58.438
What, are you lookin'
at something, Mancuso?

09:01.274 --> 09:03.243
I think we start by taking
the old one off, right?

09:03.276 --> 09:06.046
 - Right. Here we go.
 - All right.

09:06.079 --> 09:08.114
   - Got it?
   - Got it.

09:08.148 --> 09:10.850
Both: Oh, man!

09:11.885 --> 09:14.254
 What do we
 do with that?

09:14.287 --> 09:16.423
   Let's put it
   in here.

09:20.226 --> 09:21.494
 You put that in your locker?

09:21.528 --> 09:24.030
  Nah, that was
  Mancuso's.

09:25.899 --> 09:28.101
So what do we do next?

09:28.134 --> 09:29.869
( Billy stops crying )

09:29.903 --> 09:32.839
See? That's what was wrong
with him all the time.

09:32.872 --> 09:35.342
  Now we just got to cover
  him with a new one.

09:35.375 --> 09:37.811
  Wait, I'll do this.
  I know it.

09:37.844 --> 09:40.046
   Hey, I'll do it.
   You don't know anything.

09:40.046 --> 09:42.449
No, he's my responsibility.
We've had French
class together.

09:42.482 --> 09:45.185
   - We've bonded, okay?
   - I know what I'm doing.
   Let it go.

09:45.218 --> 09:47.854
No. Oh!

09:47.887 --> 09:49.422
  - Good one!
  - Good one, Slater.

09:49.456 --> 09:51.391
 That was his
 last diaper.

09:51.424 --> 09:55.528
   I just remembered.
   Picture time. I gotta go.

09:55.562 --> 09:57.564
   But suppose
   Billy has to go?

09:57.597 --> 10:00.200
  You're bonded.
  You figure it out.

10:02.535 --> 10:05.472
   - What are we gonna do?
   - ( Billy cries )

10:05.505 --> 10:07.540
   Shh. Watch this.
   Watch me.

10:07.574 --> 10:09.175
  Come here.
  Come here.

10:09.209 --> 10:11.077
Come here. Yes.

10:25.058 --> 10:28.328
  There you go. Yes.

10:28.361 --> 10:31.197
   There you go.
   You see?

10:31.231 --> 10:33.533
  Come here. Hold on.
  All right.

10:33.566 --> 10:36.503
 There you go.
 You see that?

10:36.536 --> 10:39.406
   Unkie Slater won't mind
   if you borrow his shirt.

10:40.874 --> 10:43.143
   ( Billy giggles )

10:43.176 --> 10:46.179
  You know, you're awfully cute
  when you're not leaking.

10:46.212 --> 10:49.616
  Maybe someday I'll have a kid
  and I won't mind if
  he's just like you.

10:51.451 --> 10:53.620
 Now, son, this is your
 first day of school,

10:53.653 --> 10:56.289
 so I want you to behave
 yourself and make your old
 man proud, okay?

10:56.322 --> 10:57.924
- Okay.
- Okay.

10:58.892 --> 11:00.593
  Hold it.
  Come here.

11:01.961 --> 11:04.064
Let me have
the water gun.

11:05.899 --> 11:07.934
 And the frog.

11:10.136 --> 11:12.939
Very good.
And the phone.

11:12.972 --> 11:15.942
  - Aw, Dad.
  - Come on.

11:18.278 --> 11:20.814
 There you go.

11:20.847 --> 11:22.816
  All right,
  son, now put it here,
  put it here, okay?

11:22.849 --> 11:25.952
Right here.
Just like I taught you,
burn one in, no batter.

11:25.985 --> 11:27.487
 - Okay?
 - Okay, Dad.

11:27.520 --> 11:29.823
Here comes
my best pitch.

11:32.092 --> 11:34.361
  ( glass shatters )

11:34.394 --> 11:37.297
   Boy, have you got
   a great arm, kid.

11:38.565 --> 11:41.401
 Of course, that window's
 coming out of your allowance.

11:41.434 --> 11:44.437
   Aw, Dad.

11:44.471 --> 11:47.607
 Well, son, just a few
 seconds ago, you were
 playing Little League.

11:47.640 --> 11:50.877
 Now you're leaving for college
 to play the field, huh?

11:51.945 --> 11:54.180
 Gosh, they
 grow up fast.

11:54.214 --> 11:56.549
   I'm off, Dad. Gotta get
   a head start in partying.

11:56.583 --> 11:58.618
   That's right.
   Hold it.

11:58.651 --> 12:00.320
   Let me have
   the credit card.

12:01.054 --> 12:03.056
   Aw, Dad.

12:05.325 --> 12:07.460
That's my boy.

12:07.494 --> 12:10.463
   Okay, Billy, come on,
   we gotta sprint.

12:15.969 --> 12:17.971
  Hey, Jessie, Lisa,
  come on, you guys.

12:18.071 --> 12:20.407
 - You got to help me out here.
 - Sure, Zack.

12:20.440 --> 12:22.375
Why is Billy wearing
Slater's shirt?

12:22.409 --> 12:25.211
It's a long, wet story.

12:25.245 --> 12:27.280
But he's a cute
little squirt.

12:29.215 --> 12:30.350
 So what do you want us to do?

12:30.383 --> 12:32.085
Just watch
Billy for a second.

12:32.085 --> 12:33.920
 But we've got
 Home Ec this period.

12:33.953 --> 12:37.390
 Oh, perfect. If he gets
 hungry, just make his formula.

12:39.092 --> 12:40.927
   - Zack.
   - Come on. Look,

12:40.960 --> 12:43.163
if I'm not back before
the end of your class,

12:43.196 --> 12:46.099
  I'll just have Screech
  relieve you, okay?

12:46.099 --> 12:48.168
   Please, Jessie?
   Come on.

12:48.201 --> 12:50.437
 - All right, go ahead.
 - Thanks.

12:50.470 --> 12:52.305
   Oh, oh, oh, and remember,

12:52.339 --> 12:54.374
don't jiggle him
if he cries, rock him.

12:54.407 --> 12:57.410
And don't burp him too hard
after the bottle,
he hates that.

13:02.582 --> 13:05.185
 Now, girls,
 pay close attention.

13:05.218 --> 13:08.822
   Infant care is a big part
   of your grade this term.

13:08.855 --> 13:13.326
 Now remember,
 it's very important
 to support your baby's head.

13:13.360 --> 13:15.095
 Holding your baby
 any other way

13:15.128 --> 13:17.464
  could make it
  very uncomfortable.

13:22.535 --> 13:23.803
 See?

13:23.837 --> 13:25.872
  Now that could
  hurt baby.

13:27.407 --> 13:30.844
 Now I know what
 happened to Screech.

13:30.877 --> 13:33.279
 And remember,
 should the unexpected happen,

13:33.313 --> 13:35.515
  it's important not
  to lose your head.

13:35.548 --> 13:38.118
( Billy cries )

13:39.552 --> 13:42.956
  My, they make these
  dolls life-like don't they?

13:42.989 --> 13:45.992
   ( Billy crying )

13:46.092 --> 13:48.528
   How do I make
   him stop crying?

13:49.529 --> 13:51.931
Quiet, and we'll
buy you a new wardrobe.

13:51.965 --> 13:55.301
 - ( Billy stops crying )
 - See? Always worked with me.

13:57.103 --> 13:59.606
  Mrs. Hatcher, can I take
  the yearbook pictures now?

13:59.639 --> 14:03.243
 Girls,
 the photographer's here.
 Put your babies down.

14:04.210 --> 14:05.879
Gently.

14:05.912 --> 14:08.181
   I see we're going to have
   to work on that tomorrow.

14:11.284 --> 14:14.487
  Ooh, very good,
  Miss Spano.

14:14.521 --> 14:16.456
  Come along, girls.

14:16.489 --> 14:19.893
- Should I leave him here?
- Where's he gonna go?

14:19.926 --> 14:22.295
 Hurry, girls.
 You're holding us up.

14:24.064 --> 14:26.099
 Now, group together.

14:26.132 --> 14:28.868
  - Look like little mothers.
  - ( camera shutter clicks )

14:35.208 --> 14:38.244
 Uh, Miss Spano, Miss Turtle,
 what is it that you're doing?

14:38.278 --> 14:41.247
   Drying our nails?

14:41.281 --> 14:43.850
   Actually, we're on
   the Spirit Squad.

14:43.883 --> 14:47.087
 Jessie,
 I already took that picture
 this morning. You were great.

14:47.087 --> 14:50.323
  We just can't help ourselves.
  We've got so much
  spirit left over.

14:50.357 --> 14:52.359
 Yeah, we're just full of it.

14:54.327 --> 14:56.830
 In fact, here's one
 of our latest cheers.

14:58.131 --> 15:00.834
 Move it to the left!
 Move it to the right!

15:00.867 --> 15:04.537
Further to the right!
Not there!
Yes, there! You got it!

15:04.571 --> 15:06.172
  You got it!

15:06.206 --> 15:08.241
 Fight, fight, fight!

15:13.313 --> 15:16.549
 Oh, Screech, you're a pal.
 You came
 through for me and got Billy.

15:16.583 --> 15:18.385
   Were the girls
   still in Home Ec?

15:18.418 --> 15:21.788
  Yeah, looks like fun too.
  They end each
  class with a cheer.

15:23.056 --> 15:25.125
   Here,
   I'll take the little guy.

15:25.158 --> 15:26.893
  Boy, I missed him.

15:26.926 --> 15:29.062
   Y-- hey!

15:29.062 --> 15:32.465
 Looks like I missed
 the little guy, too.

15:32.499 --> 15:34.934
  Screech, you got
  a dummy, you dummy!

15:42.175 --> 15:45.645
   I mean you'd absolutely have
   to be some kind
   of major doofus!

15:45.679 --> 15:49.082
   Well,
   I agree but I wouldn't call
   Jessie that to her face.

15:49.082 --> 15:50.550
Me? You took
the wrong baby.

15:50.583 --> 15:53.953
I only took the one
you pointed to, doofus.

15:53.987 --> 15:56.589
  The important thing
  right now is to find Billy.

15:56.623 --> 15:57.991
   You sure he's not
   in the classroom?

15:58.091 --> 16:01.194
 After Max left,
 Mrs. Hatcher dismissed us all.

16:01.227 --> 16:03.630
  By the time we snuck back in,
  he was gone.

16:03.663 --> 16:07.033
Did you look hard enough?!
Did you?!
Well, I don't think so!

16:07.033 --> 16:11.571
None of us are
leaving this floor
until we find my baby!

16:11.604 --> 16:14.874
  Your baby? Zack,
  I think you're
  getting hysterical.

16:14.908 --> 16:18.778
 Zack,
 don't worry, we'll find him.
 Besides, it's not your fault.

16:18.812 --> 16:20.046
 So where's
 the bambino?

16:20.046 --> 16:21.815
Zack lost him.

16:22.716 --> 16:24.884
You're an unfit mother.

16:24.918 --> 16:27.487
  I'm not the one who lost him.
  It was Tweedle Dee

16:27.520 --> 16:30.090
  and Tweedle Dummies,
  over here.

16:30.123 --> 16:32.092
   We're not doing any good
   standing around.

16:32.125 --> 16:34.127
  All right, look.
  We'll spread out and search

16:34.160 --> 16:36.196
  every inch of this school
  until we find him.

16:36.229 --> 16:39.165
  Zack,
  what are you going to tell
  Kelly if we don't find him?

16:39.199 --> 16:41.868
  I'll worry about
  that later.

16:41.901 --> 16:44.571
- Welcome to later.
- Hey.

16:44.604 --> 16:46.072
  Kelly, are you
  all right?

16:46.072 --> 16:47.807
 I'm okay now.
 But take it from me,

16:47.841 --> 16:49.843
  if you're ever on top
  of a human pyramid,

16:49.876 --> 16:51.478
make sure someone's
on the bottom.

16:51.511 --> 16:53.480
   So where's Billy?

16:53.513 --> 16:56.082
  Uh... Billy? Billy!

16:56.082 --> 16:59.552
 Short, bald guy,
 drools a lot?

16:59.586 --> 17:02.155
 My baby brother.
 Come on guys, where's Billy?

17:02.188 --> 17:05.825
   Where is Billy?
   Jessie,
   why don't you go get him?

17:05.858 --> 17:07.727
Yeah, I'll go find him.

17:07.761 --> 17:10.696
I mean, I'll go get him.
I mean, I'm going now.

17:10.730 --> 17:12.464
   Yeah, that's it.

17:12.499 --> 17:15.568
Good luck!
I mean, see you later!

17:15.602 --> 17:18.672
  Hey, Max. Here's a great shot
  for the yearbook.

17:18.704 --> 17:21.775
 Bayside's bravest cheerleader,
 wounded in the line of duty.

17:21.808 --> 17:23.576
 - Great idea.
 - Me?

17:23.609 --> 17:26.046
 Sure. Hey, it'd be perfect
 for the cover.

17:26.046 --> 17:29.082
 Now just stand over there.
 It'll make it
 a more interesting--

17:29.115 --> 17:31.151
interesting shot, yeah.

18:04.784 --> 18:07.020
 That was fun.
 Thanks, Max.

18:08.188 --> 18:10.523
Where's Jessie? I guess
Billy's still sleeping?

18:10.557 --> 18:12.559
( Billy cries )

18:12.592 --> 18:14.594
Billy?

18:15.628 --> 18:18.031
 Belding:
<i>Googie, googie, googie.</i>

18:19.032 --> 18:21.835
 Mr. Belding?
 Aw...

18:23.470 --> 18:25.705
  Can you say
  detention?

18:27.140 --> 18:29.776
  Oh, Mr. Belding,
  thank goodness
  Billy is with you.

18:29.809 --> 18:31.177
  We were so worried.

18:31.211 --> 18:33.046
 You guys didn't
 know where Billy was?

18:33.079 --> 18:36.716
Of course we knew.
Oh golly, yes.

18:36.750 --> 18:38.918
 Wait a minute,
 but you said you were worried.

18:38.952 --> 18:40.587
Oh, well, yes.

18:40.620 --> 18:42.922
Worried that Mr.
Belding wasn't
getting any work done.

18:42.956 --> 18:45.625
 With all the work he does,
 he still takes time

18:45.658 --> 18:47.560
  to watch your
  little baby brother

18:47.594 --> 18:49.496
so-- so, um...

18:49.529 --> 18:52.232
  none of us would have to miss
  our yearbook pictures,
  that's it.

18:52.265 --> 18:54.901
 - I did?
 - The man is a saint.

18:54.934 --> 18:57.537
   Should have a river
   named after him.

18:57.570 --> 19:01.441
 That's true. But what are
 all of you doing in my office?

19:01.474 --> 19:04.511
   Lisa and Jessie had the baby
   in Home Ec and
   were supposed to--

19:07.013 --> 19:09.449
   Actually, sir, we just
   couldn't agree on

19:09.482 --> 19:11.818
who would be the lucky one
to thank you in person.

19:11.851 --> 19:14.854
That's right, sir.
So we all came.

19:14.888 --> 19:17.123
 Yes, but what is
 Kelly's baby brother

19:17.157 --> 19:19.859
  doing at Bayside
  in the first place?

19:19.893 --> 19:22.595
 - Don't you know, Mr. Belding?
 - I guess he forgot.

19:22.629 --> 19:26.032
  It's okay, Mr. Belding.
  At your age, that's normal.

19:27.801 --> 19:31.037
- What's normal?
- Memory loss.

19:31.037 --> 19:34.941
  That's funny. I don't
  remember losing my memory.

19:35.041 --> 19:38.044
   Well, that's the first
   sign of old age.

19:38.044 --> 19:40.613
  Wait a minute. Yes!

19:40.647 --> 19:45.218
 Yes,
 I remember everything now.
 And so clearly.

19:45.251 --> 19:48.888
 Kelly, your baby
 brother is adorable.

19:48.922 --> 19:51.491
   - What's his name again?
   - Billy.

19:51.524 --> 19:54.060
   Right. I knew that.
   And you're Lisa.

19:54.060 --> 19:56.796
 See, I'm still young.

19:56.830 --> 19:59.833
  Mr. Belding, I've taken
  all the yearbook pictures.

19:59.866 --> 20:01.935
  But there's always
  room for one more.

20:01.968 --> 20:04.004
  Everybody watch
  the birdie.

20:07.607 --> 20:09.075
Uh-oh.

20:09.109 --> 20:11.811
Billy, my shirt is wet.

20:16.983 --> 20:18.852
 I'll carry Billy
 home for you.

20:18.885 --> 20:21.721
   Zack, you've really become
   fond of him, haven't you?

20:21.755 --> 20:23.857
   I'm seeing
   a whole new you.

20:23.890 --> 20:25.592
  How about the new me
  taking the old you

20:25.625 --> 20:27.027
  to a movie Saturday night?

20:27.060 --> 20:29.829
  Zack, something tells me you
  haven't changed that much.

20:29.863 --> 20:34.567
   Oh, yeah? Hey, I changed him
   38 times, didn't I?
   Yes, I did.

20:34.601 --> 20:36.102
  But I have to admit

20:36.136 --> 20:39.072
it's nice to know that when
I need you,
I can count on you.

20:39.105 --> 20:40.907
  Did you see
  that Billy?

20:40.940 --> 20:43.109
What about me?
I helped, too.

20:43.143 --> 20:45.779
Billy's wearing
my best shirt.

20:45.812 --> 20:48.982
  Thanks, I can
  count on you, too.

20:49.015 --> 20:51.885
  Hey, come here, little buddy.
  Come here, come here.

20:51.918 --> 20:53.953
( Billy cries )

20:55.155 --> 20:58.224
 Don't worry, Kelly.
 I'll get him to stop.

20:58.258 --> 21:01.461
Yo, kid.
Give it a rest.

21:01.494 --> 21:04.097
   It worked when my mother
   said it to me, all right?

21:04.130 --> 21:06.132
   Give him to me.
   Come on.

21:06.166 --> 21:10.070
   - Come here. Yes, yes.
   - ( Billy stops crying )

21:14.507 --> 21:16.810
That's amazing.

21:16.843 --> 21:19.079
   Shh! Shh! He's trying
   to say something.

21:19.112 --> 21:21.247
  He can't talk yet.

21:21.281 --> 21:23.516
Billy: Zzzack!

21:25.518 --> 21:27.887
He talked, Billy said
his first word!

21:27.921 --> 21:30.223
  Wait a minute.
  What did he say? ''Snack''?

21:31.624 --> 21:34.794
 No, he said, ''Zack.''
 I am totally amazed.

21:34.828 --> 21:37.097
Not me.
That's my boy.

21:37.697 --> 21:39.733
 We've bonded.

21:45.839 --> 21:48.742
 ( instrumental music plays )
