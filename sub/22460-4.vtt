# I'm not sick, but I'm not well

00:49.660 --> 00:52.699
# And I'm so hot

01:03.020 --> 01:05.539
Where the hell are you, Jeremy?
We'll be late for the christening.

01:05.540 --> 01:06.979
Chill, brother. Where are you?

01:06.980 --> 01:09.819
I'm at the station, where you were
supposed to be 15 minutes ago.

01:09.820 --> 01:11.179
I'm in a phone box.

01:11.180 --> 01:13.099
What are you doing in a phone box?

01:13.100 --> 01:15.779
Have you put a farthing in the slot?
Hey, Mark's in a phone box!

01:15.780 --> 01:18.419
Is it an ironic thing?
Are you doing it ironically?

01:18.420 --> 01:19.899
No. I've simply got rid of my mobile.

01:19.900 --> 01:23.419
You've what?
Oh, my God, this is massive!

01:23.420 --> 01:26.819
What are you gonna do next, move into
a hut and start drinking your own piss?

01:26.820 --> 01:28.379
We've got a land line.

01:28.380 --> 01:30.099
Times are hard, Jeremy.

01:30.100 --> 01:33.219
I'm putting my clarinet on eBay.
I'm making my own hummus.

01:33.220 --> 01:34.659
This is the end times.

01:34.660 --> 01:36.819
A mobile's a luxury.
Yeah, right

01:36.820 --> 01:40.339
What if I need to contact you? What if
I take a mega trip and forget who I am?

01:40.340 --> 01:42.899
What if we run out of Marmite
and you're at the corner shop?

01:42.900 --> 01:45.019
These are all real-life
nightmare scenarios.

01:45.020 --> 01:47.139
Look, where the hell are you?
I'm coming to get you.

01:47.140 --> 01:49.619
Zahra's.
Oh. Right.

01:49.620 --> 01:53.459
We were doing some work for Ben,
and it got late and I stayed over.

01:53.460 --> 01:55.299
God!
Well, be ready.

01:55.300 --> 01:57.659
We've missed the train.
I'll get us a cab.

01:57.660 --> 02:00.339
'Free cab ride to the christening.
Another win for the lazy man.'

02:00.340 --> 02:02.459
Right, I'm rolling.

02:02.460 --> 02:06.059
OK, let's brew this thing!

02:06.060 --> 02:10.059
Fuck!
Bye, Jeremy.

02:10.780 --> 02:14.419
How long is this gonna take?
How long does a washing machine take?

02:14.420 --> 02:17.179
Could be, like, 15 minutes.
Could be, like, 18 hours.

02:17.180 --> 02:19.379
I normally just bang it in
and leave it for a couple of days.

02:19.380 --> 02:21.019
We're going to be late
if we don't leave right away.

02:21.020 --> 02:23.659
Well, fine, but I can't
just take them out, can I?

02:23.660 --> 02:26.819
It's so frustrating. I can
see them, but I can't get to them.

02:26.820 --> 02:29.099
We'll buy you some trousers
on the way. We need to leave now!

02:29.100 --> 02:31.139
'Oh, great, Tesco trousers'

02:31.140 --> 02:32.659
Ben's!

02:32.660 --> 02:35.539
I can get them back by tonight.
He'll never know the difference.

02:35.540 --> 02:38.539
Oh, great.
Steal his woman, steal his trousers.

02:38.540 --> 02:41.019
You and your wicked willy.

02:41.020 --> 02:44.699
Has it never occurred to you that two
human beings of the opposite gender

02:44.700 --> 02:48.019
could have a simple human relationship
without sex being involved?

02:48.020 --> 02:50.539
You think you know me so well,
but you don't.

02:50.540 --> 02:53.179
Jeremy, you once told me
that chairs make you feel horny.

02:53.180 --> 02:55.459
I'm not just some filthy sex beast,
you know.

02:55.460 --> 02:59.459
I am capable of higher thought. I
do have feelings, ambitions, dreams.

03:00.420 --> 03:03.699
I thought of that hat
that could keep beer cool if you...

03:03.700 --> 03:06.899
Uh-huh. Sure. Great. Now, there's
a minicab place not far from here.

03:06.900 --> 03:08.819
We can... What's...?
DOOR RATTLES

03:08.820 --> 03:12.099
Just turn the knob. Well, I
am turning the knob, obviously.

03:12.100 --> 03:13.819
Well, turn it properly.
Well, I am turning it properly.

03:13.820 --> 03:16.659
Well, obviously not,
otherwise the door would be open.

03:16.660 --> 03:19.779
It's not opening.It's not opening!

03:19.780 --> 03:23.739
Let me try...Mr Patheto-hand.

03:23.740 --> 03:25.019
Oh.

03:25.020 --> 03:27.019
'A little bit pleased he
didn't manage it with ease.'

03:27.020 --> 03:29.659
It can't be locked. 'Uh-oh.'

03:29.660 --> 03:33.379
Someone's double-locked it?
Fucking fucklebucks!

03:33.380 --> 03:35.459
Don't sweat it, dude.
I'll call Zahra.

03:35.460 --> 03:37.819
'Hi, it's Zahra.'
Oh, answerphone.

03:37.820 --> 03:40.339
'Please leave a message.'
Er, hi, Zahra. Jez here.

03:40.340 --> 03:41.979
Yeah, erm, we're locked in your
building,

03:41.980 --> 03:45.819
so if you could come back and release us
from the cage, that'd be much appreciated.

03:45.820 --> 03:47.299
Thanks a lot. Bye-bye.

03:47.300 --> 03:50.699
We can't get back in
and we can't get out!

03:50.700 --> 03:53.539
We're trapped, Jeremy.
We're bloody trapped!

03:53.540 --> 03:57.539
Relax, I'll credit-card the lock.
That's a debit card.

03:59.780 --> 04:03.099
Oh, fuck, this is impossible.
It's really irresponsible of films

04:03.100 --> 04:05.379
to make out that this is an option
at all, because it just isn't.

04:05.380 --> 04:09.379
Oh, God! I'm the sort of person who
rewinds if I miss a tiny bit of a film,

04:09.420 --> 04:11.779
even a film I'm not particularly
enjoying,

04:11.780 --> 04:15.779
and now I'm gonna miss
the whole of my son's christening.

04:15.860 --> 04:18.139
'All I have in the dad bank
is my record of punctuality.

04:18.140 --> 04:19.659
'Without that, I've got nothing.

04:19.660 --> 04:23.659
'Come on, Flat B, was it youwho so
coldly locked us in here to die?

04:23.860 --> 04:27.099
'Or the security-obsessed wanker
in Flat A?'

04:27.100 --> 04:29.539
Ring Zahra again.
No, my battery. I've only got, like,

04:29.540 --> 04:31.259
a milli-bit of power bar left.

04:31.260 --> 04:34.259
I suppose a phone of your own might
be quite useful right now, yeah?

04:34.260 --> 04:37.859
Yes, it would, and I'm an idiot,
and any attempt I make

04:37.860 --> 04:41.219
to escape the debt-driven rat race
must be punished immediately

04:41.220 --> 04:42.659
and in the most brutal fashion.

04:42.660 --> 04:45.899
OK? Happy now?

04:45.900 --> 04:48.059
I suppose we do need
to get out of here quite soon,

04:48.060 --> 04:49.819
before the air supply runs out.
What?

04:49.820 --> 04:51.339
Well, in here,

04:51.340 --> 04:54.259
the air supply's gonna run out
sooner or later.

04:54.260 --> 04:57.019
What? I'm not an idiot...

04:57.020 --> 04:58.579
Why does that make me an idiot?

04:58.580 --> 05:02.579
I need to make one call.
Just one call.

05:02.900 --> 05:05.339
Just one. I'm not having you
being profligate with my bar.

05:05.340 --> 05:08.619
Hello, Directories? Yeah,
Thornton Heath locksmiths, please.

05:08.620 --> 05:09.659
That's two!

05:09.660 --> 05:12.099
They're putting me through.
It counts as one. Hello?

05:12.100 --> 05:15.619
It's just possible
you could save my life.

05:15.620 --> 05:19.619
Yeah... I've got myself locked in
my flat, if you can believe it.

05:20.740 --> 05:22.819
The address? Er, yep, the address.

05:22.820 --> 05:25.339
It's, erm, King's Road...
King's Drive.

05:25.340 --> 05:26.979
King's Drive.

05:26.980 --> 05:29.699
And the number?The number...

05:29.700 --> 05:31.579
52. Ooh, 54.

05:31.580 --> 05:34.699
Er, 5...
It's in the 50s.

05:34.700 --> 05:37.499
Is it a 40? 40-something?
It's a 40...

05:37.500 --> 05:40.179
Perhaps you could come to
King's Drive and walk up and down,

05:40.180 --> 05:41.699
and I'll shout through
the letter box?

05:41.700 --> 05:43.219
42! 42 King's Drive!

05:43.220 --> 05:47.219
42! We're pretty sure
we live at 42 King's Drive.

05:47.580 --> 05:50.499
Well, that's customer service.
He called me a prong.

05:50.500 --> 05:52.979
"Prong"?
OK, Mark, give me the phone.

05:52.980 --> 05:56.939
Yeah, but there's the police
or the fire brigade?

05:56.940 --> 06:00.139
If we tell one of them, they'll alert
the others, cos they're all friends.

06:00.140 --> 06:01.579
I mean, not friends, but...

06:01.580 --> 06:03.019
Mark, I know this phone.

06:03.020 --> 06:06.099
It's not one of these fakers than
can run forever on one red millimetre.

06:06.100 --> 06:07.539
This phone doesn't fuck around.

06:07.540 --> 06:11.219
'I never used to let my battery
run down. I miss you, phone.'

06:11.220 --> 06:12.579
Ambulance?
Pizza.

06:12.580 --> 06:15.059
You can't waste the bar on pizza!

06:15.060 --> 06:16.779
Yes, I will hold.
Don't hold!

06:16.780 --> 06:18.379
I'm hungry, Mark!

06:18.380 --> 06:22.379
I didn't have any breakfast! Or would
you have us both starve to death?

06:22.460 --> 06:24.659
Yes, I'd like a large...
'Look at him,

06:24.660 --> 06:28.659
'the greedy gobfather gobbling pizza
on his godson's time.'

06:29.420 --> 06:31.819
Are you posting yourself out
piece by piece?

06:31.820 --> 06:35.259
I'm trying to catch the light
with my watch face, send out an SOS.

06:35.260 --> 06:39.259
Morse code. A passer-by
might notice it. Uh-huh.

06:39.900 --> 06:43.899
Maybe you'll attract a naval captain,
who'll come and rescue us in his frigate.

06:43.940 --> 06:45.299
Ooh, I tell you what, though.
What?

06:45.300 --> 06:46.899
I really need a wee.

06:46.900 --> 06:49.299
Maybe...in a corner?

06:49.300 --> 06:53.299
Or we could make an area
that became...disgusting?

06:53.500 --> 06:56.819
No, I'm not having it in here. If you
need to wee, there's the letter box.

06:56.820 --> 06:59.219
You mean flop the hose out
of the slot? Well, needs must.

06:59.220 --> 07:02.419
Oh, right, and what if a passer-by
decides to try and to turn off the nozzle?

07:02.420 --> 07:04.579
Hm? What if a squirrel
wants a sausage?

07:04.580 --> 07:08.579
I'm not just sending my member out
into the world solo to seek his fortune.

07:08.580 --> 07:10.379
I look after him
and he looks after me.

07:10.380 --> 07:13.939
That's the contract. The letter box
is not a glory hole for urine.

07:13.940 --> 07:17.419
Right, I'm going to this christening.
I'm gonna bloody well kick the door down.

07:17.420 --> 07:21.419
Are you serious? You're going to
kick the door, using one of your legs,

07:21.540 --> 07:22.659
with enough force,

07:22.660 --> 07:25.339
it's going to be smashed open?
Yes.

07:25.340 --> 07:29.339
Mark Corrigan is going to kick down
a door. Oh, this is too good.

07:29.500 --> 07:32.259
Don't start yet.
Just let me get settled.

07:32.260 --> 07:36.259
OK...and go, go, Gadget Leg!

07:37.020 --> 07:38.939
Mm, mm, good.

07:38.940 --> 07:40.699
Good first kick. Of course,

07:40.700 --> 07:42.779
you are going to have to
smash it out of the frame,

07:42.780 --> 07:45.699
so only about another million more
kicks like that and we'll be out.

07:45.700 --> 07:48.419
Fuck you.
I'm not wearing the right shoes.

07:48.420 --> 07:51.139
Oh, right, yeah, wrong shoes!
Yeah, sure. Bummer.

07:51.140 --> 07:52.659
Arrrgh!

07:52.660 --> 07:54.219
I am so screwed!

07:54.220 --> 07:57.499
I'm so utterly, utterly screwed!

07:57.500 --> 07:59.019
Look, dude, Zahra's gonna call back.

07:59.020 --> 08:03.019
But, you know, until she does,
we're in the Nether Zone, yeah?

08:03.700 --> 08:07.699
Time moves at a different speed in
the Nether Zone. We need to relax.

08:08.140 --> 08:12.139
You can't relax! We've got to fight,
worry, speculate, tut, pace, swear!

08:13.820 --> 08:15.699
Why?
Because it's an emergency!

08:15.700 --> 08:18.339
And in an emergency,
you watch breaking news

08:18.340 --> 08:20.059
and count your tins of butter beans.

08:20.060 --> 08:23.179
You don't just sit in the garden
and put on Kiss FM.

08:23.180 --> 08:25.659
Dude, we're here for the duration.
Let's chill out.

08:25.660 --> 08:28.139
We have an obligation to be anxious.

08:28.140 --> 08:31.259
It's a mark of respect
for the gravity of the situation.

08:31.260 --> 08:32.779
Let's get to know each other.

08:32.780 --> 08:33.938
Oh, for God's sake!

08:33.940 --> 08:36.578
OK, um... Oh, oh!

08:36.580 --> 08:40.578
OK, if you had to - if you had to -
would you have sex with me?

08:42.299 --> 08:44.019
It's a stupid question.

08:44.020 --> 08:48.019
If you had to. If the men came
and they made us, with their guns.

08:48.740 --> 08:50.379
Oh, I don't know.

08:50.380 --> 08:54.379
I suppose...maybe I could do it,
just so long as you didn't...

08:54.500 --> 08:56.419
What?
..enjoy it.

08:56.420 --> 09:00.419
I think maybe I could make it through,
as long as I knew you weren't enjoying it.

09:00.460 --> 09:04.459
Hang on. You're saying you could rape
me, but you couldn't make love to me.

09:05.780 --> 09:09.459
That is so you.
That is you all over.

09:09.460 --> 09:11.819
That is not me all over.

09:11.820 --> 09:15.819
OK, here's a history one. What would
you have done in France in the war?

09:16.220 --> 09:18.259
Would you have joined
the Resistance or not?

09:18.260 --> 09:21.019
I'm not getting into that. Ah,
but you want to, though, don't you?

09:21.020 --> 09:22.699
I've tickled your historical G-spot.

09:22.700 --> 09:25.739
Jeremy, you could at least
try to take this seriously.

09:25.740 --> 09:28.739
You are the godfather.

09:28.740 --> 09:30.859
What do you thinkabout this, Jeremy?

09:30.860 --> 09:32.619
Do you think this is too high?

09:32.620 --> 09:35.539
Nah, that's fine. Totally fine.

09:35.540 --> 09:37.499
Why don't you just jump
out of the window?

09:37.500 --> 09:39.419
I think I could probably do it.

09:39.420 --> 09:43.419
I just need to lower myself
the initial portion and then drop.

09:43.660 --> 09:44.939
Mark, we're not in Road Runner.

09:44.940 --> 09:48.579
Jeremy, I'm a father.
I need to be at my son's christening.

09:48.580 --> 09:50.739
I'm not a park bench
White Lightning guy.

09:50.740 --> 09:52.979
Besides, after weeks of negotiation,

09:52.980 --> 09:56.979
I finally got Sophie to agree to James
Ian rather than Ian James, after her dad.

09:57.940 --> 09:59.459
Baby Ian.
Mm...

09:59.460 --> 10:02.699
Ian Chapman. You'd have a baby
that sounded like a solicitor.

10:02.700 --> 10:04.179
Exactly.

10:04.180 --> 10:07.899
So I need to make sure she doesn't
swerve off-road at the last moment.

10:07.900 --> 10:11.579
Do you really think it's impossible?
Well, I mean, I could make it, but...

10:11.580 --> 10:13.779
You think I couldn't do it
but you could?

10:13.780 --> 10:15.539
Yeah, if I needed to.

10:15.540 --> 10:17.779
I'd just jump over the trellis,
bounce off the wall,

10:17.780 --> 10:19.819
hit the ground, parachute roll -
basic moves.

10:19.820 --> 10:22.139
Well, go on, then.
Nah.

10:22.140 --> 10:23.939
Why not?
Not in the mood.

10:23.940 --> 10:26.379
'Could I jump? Might make it easily.

10:26.380 --> 10:29.819
'More likely splatter
like a blood-filled pumpkin.'

10:29.820 --> 10:32.819
'Oh, that's better.'

10:32.820 --> 10:35.659
You're actually doing it?
Yes, I'm actually doing it.

10:35.660 --> 10:36.739
God, Jeremy!

10:36.740 --> 10:40.019
What if someone outside thinks
it's some sort of comment?

10:40.020 --> 10:44.019
I hope there's no black or minority ethnic
person walking past who thinks it's...

10:44.020 --> 10:45.859
Mark, it's a perfectly friendly
piss.

10:45.860 --> 10:47.299
I'm not...

10:47.300 --> 10:49.499
Oh, shit! Withdraw all units.

10:49.500 --> 10:52.899
If it's the cops,
don't open the door.

10:52.900 --> 10:54.379
I can't open the door, Jeremy.

10:54.380 --> 10:57.379
That's one of the key things
about this whole situation.

10:57.380 --> 11:01.379
Pizza.
Pizza! Nutritious, delicious pizza!

11:01.900 --> 11:03.779
How's he supposed to deliver it
through a locked door?

11:03.780 --> 11:07.219
I've thought about that. Just slide
that baby through the letter box, dude.

11:07.220 --> 11:09.859
Of course, the letter box.
Your new pleasure portal.

11:09.860 --> 11:11.859
It won't fit, mate.
It's a large one.

11:11.860 --> 11:14.699
Defeated by your own greed.
It's like a Grimms' fairy-tale.

11:14.700 --> 11:17.099
Piece by piece, dude.
Piece by piece.

11:17.100 --> 11:19.179
Oh, you've got to be joking.
OK. Money first.

11:19.180 --> 11:21.179
Keep the change.

11:21.180 --> 11:25.179
This is so not how I imagined the day
of my first-born son's christening.

11:26.260 --> 11:28.899
Oh, shit, no, the brush!

11:28.900 --> 11:31.579
Dude, dude,
we're getting fucked with the brush!

11:31.580 --> 11:33.219
Do you want some?

11:33.220 --> 11:35.979
A slice of bristly cheese-free
pizza,

11:35.980 --> 11:37.979
lightly brushed in your piss?

11:37.980 --> 11:39.419
How can I refuse

11:39.420 --> 11:41.819
What happens
if you eat letter-box hair?

11:41.820 --> 11:44.819
Strangely, there's been very little
research into that scenario.

11:44.820 --> 11:48.699
Does post even need brushing?
Who wants brushed post?

11:48.700 --> 11:51.099
Hang on, dude, I've got it.
I've got a sheath.

11:51.100 --> 11:53.779
Use this as a protective covering.

11:53.780 --> 11:56.659
'Look at him -
the James Dyson of pissy pizza.'

11:56.660 --> 12:00.659
Yeah... Hey, Mark, it's working.
We've cracked it!

12:00.860 --> 12:02.259
We should sell these.

12:02.260 --> 12:04.939
Periodical pizza shields.
We could take these to the Dragons!

12:04.940 --> 12:06.499
We'll make our fortune.

12:06.500 --> 12:09.939
This is a situation millions of
people find themselves in every day.

12:09.940 --> 12:13.579
There's no name for this situation,
it's so unusual!

12:13.580 --> 12:15.099
MOBILE PHONE RINGS

12:15.100 --> 12:16.459
Hello?

12:16.460 --> 12:18.459
Oh, hi, Ben.

12:18.460 --> 12:20.179
Er, where am I?

12:20.180 --> 12:24.179
I'm at home right now. 'OK,
he's lying. This is interesting.'

12:24.660 --> 12:27.219
I'll be on vibrate.
'Fine, I'll get the pizza, shall I?'

12:27.220 --> 12:30.979
OK, you're popping over to Zahra's?
Do you need to, dude?

12:30.980 --> 12:33.459
'Great, I'm gonna miss
the champagne and canapes

12:33.460 --> 12:36.499
'because I'm working
as Jeremy's mad pizza butler.'

12:36.500 --> 12:38.859
Great.
'Would actually quite like a slice.

12:38.860 --> 12:40.699
'But if I ate one,
I'd feel like he'd won.'

12:40.700 --> 12:41.739
Thanks!

12:41.740 --> 12:44.779
Oh, shit! Oh, shit! Oh, shit!
Ben's coming here! He's got a key.

12:44.780 --> 12:47.979
He's gonna pick up his laptop.
Oh, fingerbobs!

12:47.980 --> 12:50.019
Well, that's great.
We're saved. We're rescued!

12:50.020 --> 12:52.819
We might make it to the christening in
time. Everything's gonna be all right!

12:52.820 --> 12:55.659
No, it's not.
Everything's triple-fried fucked!

12:55.660 --> 12:58.419
Oh? Why?

12:58.420 --> 13:01.659
Because I did sleep with Zahra last
night, OK? If you really want to know.

13:01.660 --> 13:03.859
Then why did you have such a go at me
for being filthy-minded?

13:03.860 --> 13:07.099
I don't know. I was just on a roll,
enjoying being self-righteous.

13:07.100 --> 13:09.099
Besides, we very nearly didn't.

13:09.100 --> 13:11.259
I see.
But then we totally did.

13:11.260 --> 13:13.979
I mean, if it makes you feel any
better, the sex was terrible.

13:13.980 --> 13:17.299
We didn't connect.
She's Lego, I'm a Stickle Brick.

13:17.300 --> 13:19.059
She's very orally focused,
whereas I'm...

13:19.060 --> 13:21.099
It's fine.
Oh, shit.

13:21.100 --> 13:23.499
Oh, this is bad.
This is really, really bad.

13:23.500 --> 13:26.859
I'm gonna lose the best job I've
ever had. Oh, what am I gonna do?

13:26.860 --> 13:30.379
Why don't you try having sex with women
who aren't already in relationships?

13:30.380 --> 13:31.899
Oh, that's nice

13:31.900 --> 13:33.819
Kick the dirty dog while he's down.

13:33.820 --> 13:37.699
The dirty, filthy dog deserves
another quick boot in his tender nuts.

13:37.700 --> 13:41.699
'It is quite nice kicking him in his
tender nuts, the filthy, filthy bastard.'

13:43.420 --> 13:44.859
We've got to get out of here!

13:44.860 --> 13:48.739
Yes, that has been my view
for some time, as it happens.

13:48.740 --> 13:50.939
'Ooh.' Oh.

13:50.940 --> 13:52.899
Is this the same window?
Cos it looks much higher up.

13:52.900 --> 13:55.099
What, now you're actually
considering it?

13:55.100 --> 13:58.259
Oh, I can't do it.
'Of course. He's a pathetic worm,

13:58.260 --> 13:59.579
'just like me. Good.'

13:59.580 --> 14:02.059
Ben's gonna be here any minute.
I've got to hide.

14:02.060 --> 14:03.619
Brilliant, hide.

14:03.620 --> 14:07.499
You could pretend to be a stuffed beast
or an extremely peculiarly shaped parcel.

14:07.500 --> 14:10.779
Hey, Dr Sarcasmo,
I've found something. Look.

14:10.780 --> 14:14.219
OK, congratulations,
you've found an area.

14:14.220 --> 14:16.219
But we can utilise this area.

14:16.220 --> 14:17.699
Uh-huh?

14:17.700 --> 14:20.899
It could be great for sleeping, this could
be where we sleep. Or do our business.

14:20.900 --> 14:23.579
We are not shitting or sleeping
in the area, Jeremy.

14:23.580 --> 14:26.939
I could hide in the area
when Ben comes.

14:26.940 --> 14:30.739
Perfect!

14:30.740 --> 14:34.739
Hmm. Didn't get four across, "boat",
but they aced "solipsism"?

14:35.340 --> 14:37.179
Who was this person?

14:37.180 --> 14:40.099
Hey, look, Mark!
Yeah?

14:40.100 --> 14:42.179
A thing. A bit.

14:42.180 --> 14:44.779
This is our ticket out of here.
We can do anything with this!

14:44.780 --> 14:47.899
Your faith in the "bit"
is touching, Jez.

14:47.900 --> 14:51.899
We could smash a window, or break a
lock, or hit a man over the head with it.

14:52.420 --> 14:54.099
It's like Whose Line Is it Anyway?
for criminals.

14:54.100 --> 14:58.599
We could sit on it for
entertainment, or I could wedge it in.

14:59.860 --> 15:02.499
'Come on, bit.
Don't let me down now, bit.'

15:02.500 --> 15:03.939
Hold on, Jeremy.

15:03.940 --> 15:07.019
I think I might have found a simpler
way of doing that, under the bucket.

15:07.020 --> 15:11.019
Zahra's spare?

15:12.140 --> 15:13.179
Ahhh!

15:13.180 --> 15:16.679
'Great Into the flat.
Back to square one. Whoo-hoo'

15:32.700 --> 15:33.899
Right, phone.

15:33.900 --> 15:35.219
Food! Water!

15:35.220 --> 15:37.099
Hey, I wonder
if she's the sort of dirty sausage

15:37.100 --> 15:39.779
that keep a little skin flick
at the back here.

15:39.780 --> 15:42.419
Jeremy, do you think
we could take a brief time-out

15:42.420 --> 15:46.299
from the masturbatathon that is your
life to go to my son's christening?

15:46.300 --> 15:48.739
Right, what's Sophie's mobile number?

15:48.740 --> 15:51.339
0-77-00...
that's definitely how it starts.

15:51.340 --> 15:52.459
You can do it, Rain Man.

15:52.460 --> 15:55.899
You can do it, Rain Man.
0-77-00...

15:55.900 --> 15:59.899
9-0-0-5-6-3?

16:00.500 --> 16:02.699
I think that's right.

16:02.700 --> 16:05.019
It's ringing! It's ringing!

16:05.020 --> 16:06.259
Hello?

16:06.260 --> 16:07.659
It's not her. It was a man.

16:07.660 --> 16:09.299
Try again. Try all the variations.

16:09.300 --> 16:12.739
Try all the variations of the five
or six numbers I'm not sure of?

16:12.740 --> 16:14.899
Yeah. There can only be
a few variations.

16:14.900 --> 16:16.299
Of all the numbers?

16:16.300 --> 16:17.259
Yeah.

16:17.260 --> 16:19.259
Yeah. You really are
an imbecile, aren't you?

16:19.260 --> 16:20.579
I'm only trying to help.

16:20.580 --> 16:22.139
Well, you're not helping, you're...

16:22.140 --> 16:24.579
Hi, yeah, I'm just heading in
to my bitch's place right now.

16:24.580 --> 16:25.459
KEY TURNS IN LOCK

16:25.460 --> 16:26.619
KEY TURNS IN LOCK
Hide!

16:26.620 --> 16:29.699
What?!

16:29.700 --> 16:31.539
We've got to hide!

16:31.540 --> 16:33.659
I'm grabbing my laptop,
chow down on some brunchicus.

16:33.660 --> 16:35.579
No, Jez. No, I don't want to hide.

16:35.580 --> 16:37.099
We should be safe in here.

16:37.100 --> 16:41.099
I can't believe I'm doing this.

16:41.140 --> 16:42.739
Look, we should just go out there

16:42.740 --> 16:45.059
and face up
to our responsibilities like men.

16:45.060 --> 16:46.419
Sure, go on, then.

16:46.420 --> 16:49.859
I mean, not actually,
but we should at least consider it.

16:49.860 --> 16:51.619
Look, once he's had "brunchicus",
he'll piss off

16:51.620 --> 16:52.659
and we can make a break for it.

16:52.660 --> 16:53.939
How long's that going to take?

16:53.940 --> 16:55.019
How long's that going to take?
I don't know!

16:55.020 --> 16:57.059
Since we're stuck in here,

16:57.060 --> 16:59.099
you might as well answer my question
about the French Resistance.

16:59.100 --> 17:00.739
I dunno, Jeremy.

17:00.740 --> 17:02.819
It would have been
aterribly difficult time,

17:02.820 --> 17:05.898
but I would probably
have kept my head down.

17:05.900 --> 17:09.539
You're kidding!
I totally would have joined up.

17:09.540 --> 17:11.259
That's very easy to say, Jeremy,

17:11.260 --> 17:12.858
but you would have risked death

17:12.859 --> 17:14.979
not just for yourself
but for your family.

17:14.980 --> 17:16.179
I'd probably have just got
on a train

17:16.180 --> 17:18.699
to Berlin and taken Hitler down.
Boof, the whole thing's over.

17:18.700 --> 17:20.299
Well, I guess we'll never know
for sure.

17:20.300 --> 17:23.299
Oh, I know. I definitely know.
No question about it.

17:23.300 --> 17:27.098
Well, congratulations. You would
have been a brave, brave man.

17:27.099 --> 17:30.379
I can't believe you wouldn't be
in the Resistance with me.

17:30.380 --> 17:32.259
I'm really disappointed in you.

17:32.260 --> 17:33.419
I can only apologise.

17:33.420 --> 17:34.659
Don't apologise to me.

17:34.660 --> 17:36.499
Apologise to...Europe.

17:36.500 --> 17:38.779
I don't know
why they're called beanie hats.

17:38.780 --> 17:40.099
Oh, shit, he's coming!

17:40.100 --> 17:41.859
OK, we give ourselves up,
come clean.

17:41.860 --> 17:44.579
Or...

17:44.580 --> 17:48.579
'Bloody hell!'

17:50.020 --> 17:50.899
Look, I just think beanie hats...

17:50.900 --> 17:51.939
Look, I just think beanie hats...

they're called beanie hats.

17:59.820 --> 18:02.099
Maybe it's cos in the olden days
people used to store beans in them?

18:39.060 --> 18:41.779
OK, right,
I've got to get out of here.

18:41.780 --> 18:42.819
No, Mark.

18:42.820 --> 18:45.739
If you go out there, you'll destroy
me. You'll destroy my career.

18:45.740 --> 18:48.299
Either that or destroy
my relationship with my son.

18:48.300 --> 18:50.499
Bollocks. He's how old, one month?

18:50.500 --> 18:54.499
All he knows is that it's bath time in
the biggest, weirdest bath in the world.

18:56.140 --> 18:58.659
All right, if you've got to go,
can you at least do something

18:58.660 --> 19:00.779
like run out with the radio?
Then he'll think you're a burglar.

19:00.780 --> 19:04.579
The radio-loving burglar?
What if he stabs me?

19:04.580 --> 19:06.899
He won't stab you.
You're so overly dramatic.

19:06.900 --> 19:08.459
Ben?

19:08.460 --> 19:10.099
Yeah, hi, honey, I'm in your home!

The airlock between your flat

No.

Didn't you get my message?

19:41.380 --> 19:44.619
This is really, really weird.
You're in my shower!

19:44.620 --> 19:47.179
No, Zahra,
it's not some weird thing.

19:47.180 --> 19:51.019
We're not touching ourselves
or touching each other.

19:51.020 --> 19:52.899
My boyfriend's out there.

19:52.900 --> 19:56.059
I know, and I guess
this might be a good time to,

19:56.060 --> 19:58.499
as we discussed, break up with him.

19:58.500 --> 20:02.139
I mean, he might leave, all crying,
and, you know, everyone's cushty.

20:02.140 --> 20:04.299
I can't handle thisright now,
Jeremy.

20:04.300 --> 20:07.219
I think we should put
the whole thing on ice.

20:07.220 --> 20:09.939
You mean us dancing on ice?

20:09.940 --> 20:11.539
No, like they put
dead bodies on ice.

20:11.540 --> 20:13.259
Is this about last night?

20:13.260 --> 20:15.299
Cos I can do better. I know I can.

20:15.300 --> 20:19.299
I didn't even...go down on you,
which is a great shame,

20:20.100 --> 20:22.859
because I love to go down on women,
don't I, Mark?

20:22.860 --> 20:24.499
Rinse and repeat.

20:24.500 --> 20:26.299
Always with the rinse and repeat.

20:26.300 --> 20:30.299
It's over, Jez.
That's the headline, OK?

20:30.700 --> 20:32.219
Jez, come on!

20:32.220 --> 20:35.539
Look, I really, really don't want
to get into this conversation.

20:35.540 --> 20:38.059
I'm missing my son's christening,
so if you'll excuse me...

20:38.060 --> 20:41.419
Mark, no. Ben can't find out
what's been happening.

20:41.420 --> 20:43.219
We can't break up
over one little blip.

20:43.220 --> 20:45.819
"One little blip"?

20:45.820 --> 20:47.459
Why do I keep getting dumped?

20:47.460 --> 20:49.539
I mean, what's wrong with me?
Am I a bad person?

20:49.540 --> 20:51.219
No, you're not a bad person, Jez.

20:51.220 --> 20:53.779
Zahra's just having a little wobble.
It's going to be fine.

20:53.780 --> 20:55.219
I don't think it is.

20:55.220 --> 20:57.699
I'm going. I've got to go.
I'm really, really sorry,

20:57.700 --> 20:58.819
but it's not my fault.

20:58.820 --> 21:00.019
KNOCK ON DOOR

21:00.020 --> 21:01.379
Hey, hon, can I jump in the shower?

21:01.380 --> 21:04.179
I'm so sweaty, my sack's stuck
to my leg with superglue.

21:04.180 --> 21:08.179
Give me five minutes.

21:09.180 --> 21:10.739
Jeremy! Mark?

21:10.740 --> 21:13.579
Er, yeah, sorry.
I've got to go. Goodbye.

21:13.580 --> 21:14.579
What the hell are they doing here?

21:14.580 --> 21:17.099
What the hell are they doing here?
Look, I should, er, explain.

21:17.100 --> 21:21.099
Sometimes we come here, me and Mark.
Zahra lets us use this place.

21:22.060 --> 21:22.939
What for?

21:22.940 --> 21:24.299
What for?
To meet.

21:24.300 --> 21:27.459
Um, it's just a good place
for us to...meet at lunchtime.

21:27.460 --> 21:29.099
What, are you and Mark...?

21:29.100 --> 21:30.419
It's complicated.

21:30.420 --> 21:31.459
And you use this place to...?

21:31.460 --> 21:34.619
And you use this place to...? Well, often
we'll just have a glass of wine and a chat.

21:34.620 --> 21:38.619
But yes, sometimes Mark and I
will...jump in the shower together.

21:38.900 --> 21:40.939
Still locked. Double-locked.
Can I get the key?

21:40.940 --> 21:42.419
No!But...

21:42.420 --> 21:44.259
What the fuck?
Why here? Why not at your place?

21:44.260 --> 21:48.259
Why here? Er, Mark, you explain.

21:49.860 --> 21:52.579
Well, we just feel safe here.

21:52.580 --> 21:56.579
There's a lot of prejudices
and labels in the world,

21:56.580 --> 21:58.699
but here it's a free zone.
Now can I get the key?

21:58.700 --> 21:59.179
No.

21:59.180 --> 22:00.419
No.
Very well.

22:00.420 --> 22:01.619
We used to go
to the Travelodge, but...

22:01.620 --> 22:03.699
We used to go to the Travelodge,
but... Why is he wearing my trousers?

22:03.700 --> 22:05.179
Look, the truth is

22:05.180 --> 22:09.179
that sometimes we like to pretend
that one of us is you

22:09.540 --> 22:13.339
so that the other one
gets to fuck him.

22:13.340 --> 22:15.379
That's bullshit.
You're not gay guys.

22:15.380 --> 22:17.019
You look like shit for gay guys.

22:17.020 --> 22:19.619
Hey, you don't know
all the kinds of gay guys.

22:19.620 --> 22:22.579
We're not all clones from the clone
zone. 'God, I'd be a great gay guy!'

22:22.580 --> 22:26.579
Argh!

22:27.740 --> 22:30.899
You did it, man!
Did you do a parachute roll?

22:30.900 --> 22:32.579
Sort of.

22:32.580 --> 22:33.619
You da man!

22:33.620 --> 22:37.619
'My God, he did it!
What an incredibly brave dick pipe.'

22:39.260 --> 22:41.539
We made it in time for the party.

22:41.540 --> 22:42.699
Hmm. Are you OK?

22:42.700 --> 22:45.659
He didn't actually say I was sacked.
I mean, he didn't say it.

22:45.660 --> 22:47.179
I think it was implied.

22:47.180 --> 22:48.459
I actually think I aced it.

22:48.460 --> 22:52.459
'I feel bad when everything's
basically fine, while he feels good

22:52.620 --> 22:56.619
'after enduring the most humiliating
day of his life. It's infuriating.'

22:57.220 --> 23:00.619
Hello, Ian. Sorry we're late.

23:00.620 --> 23:02.219
You've missed your son's
christening,

23:02.220 --> 23:05.219
but you've made it in time
for the sandwiches? Congratulations.

23:05.220 --> 23:06.939
Yes, well...

23:06.940 --> 23:09.659
My children's christenings were
two of the proudest days of my life.

23:09.660 --> 23:12.859
But you? What, you took the wrong
turning? Your sat-nav was broken?

23:12.860 --> 23:14.619
What was it?

23:14.620 --> 23:16.019
It was complicated.

23:16.020 --> 23:19.459
It was complicated.
You can tell that to your son.

23:19.460 --> 23:20.539
You missed it.

23:20.540 --> 23:22.539
I know. I was just...

23:22.540 --> 23:24.459
Jeff was kind enough
to stand in as godfather.

23:24.460 --> 23:27.699
Oh, that's good. Hate for him
to go to hell cos of silly old me.

23:27.700 --> 23:31.699
Just get us a pint, mate,
and we'll call it quits.

23:32.180 --> 23:33.979
Yeah, and I hope you don't mind,

23:33.980 --> 23:35.579
but we put our heads together
at the last minute,

23:35.580 --> 23:38.419
and we felt Ian James
just sounded more him.

23:38.420 --> 23:39.739
'Oh, fuck.'

23:39.740 --> 23:42.979
How about a toast?

23:42.980 --> 23:44.579
To baby Ian.

23:44.580 --> 23:46.259
Baby Ian!

23:46.260 --> 23:50.259
'Mm. Sweet, delicious,
rancid Champagne.'
