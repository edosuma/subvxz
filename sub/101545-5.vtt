WEBVTT

00:01.543 --> 00:02.085
Mistress:
Previously on "The Outpost"...

00:02.127 --> 00:04.421
Gwynn really isn't acting
like herself.

00:06.715 --> 00:09.551
- How dare you come in here--
- Come in here and accuse me

00:09.592 --> 00:11.553
of revealing Garret's
whereabouts?

00:11.594 --> 00:13.179
Falista was the love
of my childhood.

00:13.221 --> 00:15.140
Rosmund is
the love of my life.

00:15.181 --> 00:18.018
- You need my army.
- And do you promise
before the gods

00:18.059 --> 00:20.645
- that only death
can end this marriage?
- I do.

00:20.687 --> 00:22.063
Talon, you will love
being part of the United.

00:22.105 --> 00:24.482
A kinj won't work on
someone who already has one.

00:24.524 --> 00:27.527
Maybe it connects
all the stingfly brains
together like a hive.

00:27.569 --> 00:30.363
- You came back.
- She's going to infect him
with one of those things.

00:30.405 --> 00:32.115
But, Tobin,
you can lay down your arms.

00:32.157 --> 00:34.993
- Yavalla and I
are now at peace.
- You are?

00:40.206 --> 00:42.208
That army might be
our best chance to stop Yavalla.

00:42.250 --> 00:44.002
We need to keep them out there.

00:44.044 --> 00:46.504
They're less likely
to be infected by
Yavalla's kinj that way.

00:46.546 --> 00:48.173
It won't matter
if Tobin has one.

00:48.214 --> 00:49.799
They'll just follow his orders.

00:49.841 --> 00:53.178
Well, then we capture Tobin.
Find out if he has one.

00:55.430 --> 00:57.390
( chuckles )
It's Vikka.

01:00.226 --> 01:02.479
( blows whistle )

01:05.648 --> 01:07.484
It could be helpful having
a Lu-Qiri on our side.

01:09.027 --> 01:11.613
Welcome back, old friend.

01:11.654 --> 01:12.906
What a happy reunion.

01:18.745 --> 01:20.205
I'm going to capture Tobin.

01:20.246 --> 01:22.040
Wait, no. Talon, wait.

01:22.082 --> 01:23.833
You don't know if Tobin's
been infected or not.

01:23.875 --> 01:26.169
And if he has,
we don't know the extent
of the hive connection.

01:26.211 --> 01:28.588
If Yavalla can really
see through his eyes

01:28.630 --> 01:31.007
and hear through his ears,
she'll send Blackfists
to protect him.

01:31.049 --> 01:33.009
Well, then
I'll figure something out.

01:33.051 --> 01:34.844
I have to find him first.

01:39.474 --> 01:40.517
Rosmund.

01:45.063 --> 01:47.023
What's wrong, my love?

01:47.065 --> 01:50.777
Listen, Rosmund,

01:50.819 --> 01:52.779
there's something
that I need to tell you

01:52.821 --> 01:55.031
that happened while
I was in Aegisford.

01:55.073 --> 01:58.785
Whatever it is,
it doesn't matter.

02:05.834 --> 02:07.502
As much as I like
where this is headed,

02:07.544 --> 02:11.464
I've been riding
for a long while.

02:11.506 --> 02:15.051
And-- and, uh,

02:15.093 --> 02:19.264
I suspect we'll both enjoy more
once I'm cleaned up.

02:19.305 --> 02:23.101
- I smell like a horse.
- You do stink.

02:23.143 --> 02:26.187
So I'll draw you a bath here.

02:28.690 --> 02:30.150
I'll be back
before you know it.

02:45.874 --> 02:48.209
- ( Tobin shouts )
- ( grunting )

02:56.801 --> 03:00.471
- Hey!
- ( yelling )

03:16.988 --> 03:18.323
I wonder if all this writing

03:18.364 --> 03:20.700
can help us contain
this infection.

03:25.163 --> 03:28.082
Here we go again.

03:28.124 --> 03:31.586
Time to find out
if Tobin's been infected by
one of Yavalla's kinjes.

03:31.628 --> 03:34.130
Have you two lost your minds
bringing him in here?

03:34.172 --> 03:36.090
If Yavalla can really
see through his eyes,

03:36.132 --> 03:38.134
then she's gonna send people
over here and--

03:38.176 --> 03:40.762
and destroy everything
I've been working on,

03:40.803 --> 03:43.765
not to mention my own safety
and Wren's safety.

03:43.806 --> 03:46.351
I'm sorry, you've got
to get him out of here
before he wakes up.

03:46.392 --> 03:49.229
Janzo, there is nowhere else
to take him.

03:49.270 --> 03:52.774
This is a bad idea.
It's a very, very bad idea.

03:52.815 --> 03:56.778
And do you have
a better suggestion?

03:59.614 --> 04:01.783
Fine.
But when he regains
consciousness,

04:01.824 --> 04:04.327
just make sure that--
that his head is covered and--

04:04.369 --> 04:07.372
and that he--
he can't see where he is
or-- or who we are.

04:07.413 --> 04:09.374
And how are we meant
to question him?

04:09.415 --> 04:11.459
Can't Yavalla hear
through his ears as well?

04:11.501 --> 04:14.587
You see, the answer
to both of those questions
is I have no idea.

04:14.629 --> 04:19.926
And I have no idea
because I already told you
this is a bad bloody plan!

04:19.968 --> 04:23.012
( theme music playing )

04:27.892 --> 04:30.270
( yells, grunting )

04:33.773 --> 04:35.191
( muttering )

04:35.233 --> 04:36.192
What's going on?

04:36.234 --> 04:38.069
Where's Rosmund?

04:38.111 --> 04:39.654
Does she know about this?

04:41.948 --> 04:44.826
Uh, Gwynn-- ahem.

04:44.867 --> 04:47.620
( deep voice )
Gwynn-- Gwynn is under
Yavalla's control.

04:47.662 --> 04:50.290
Ahem. She is not herself.

04:51.541 --> 04:55.044
Spears, is that you?

04:55.086 --> 04:58.047
- Was it that obvious?
- Oh, gods. Roz, am I dead?

04:58.089 --> 05:00.675
Is this the afterlife?
I saw you die, Spears.

05:00.717 --> 05:03.303
Yeah, that's why we thought
you wouldn't think it was me.

05:03.344 --> 05:05.430
- So I'm alive?
- Yeah.

05:05.471 --> 05:07.140
- And you're alive?
- Don't tell him anything.

05:07.181 --> 05:09.434
- Just find out what he knows.
- Zed?

05:09.475 --> 05:11.227
You Blackblood bastard.

05:11.269 --> 05:12.770
Garret, are you working
for Zed now?

05:12.812 --> 05:15.023
No. He certainly
seems to think so.

05:15.064 --> 05:16.316
Well, you can take
this thing off my head.

05:16.357 --> 05:17.650
I know who you are,

05:17.692 --> 05:19.110
and I assume Janzo
is in here somewhere.

05:19.152 --> 05:20.903
What?
How did you know that?

05:20.945 --> 05:25.616
Because I'm in a cage
and it stinks like a brewery.

05:25.658 --> 05:28.077
I told you this was
a bad idea.

05:28.119 --> 05:29.370
All right, you, come here.

05:29.412 --> 05:31.247
- Forward, forward.
- ( grunting )

05:31.289 --> 05:33.499
- Thank you.
- ( grunting )

05:39.005 --> 05:41.966
Tell me, what do you know
about Yavalla?

05:42.008 --> 05:44.677
Not much. I thought
I was coming back here

05:44.719 --> 05:47.096
- to save Rosmund from her
and her Blackbloods.
- Mm-hmm.

05:47.138 --> 05:50.016
- Why?
- Is that what
you still believe?

05:50.058 --> 05:52.685
This is absurd!

05:52.727 --> 05:55.146
Spears, let me out!

05:55.188 --> 05:57.857
Tell me,
what did Gwynn tell you
when you arrived?

05:59.942 --> 06:03.279
- That's what this is about?
- Mm.

06:03.321 --> 06:04.614
Munt told you
I married Falista.

06:04.655 --> 06:07.116
Uh, I'm sorry. You did what?

06:07.158 --> 06:09.786
- It was the only way
I could raise an army.
- What in the gods, Tobin?

06:09.827 --> 06:12.163
- God, I wish I was dead now.
- Does Gwynn know?

06:12.205 --> 06:15.291
Who cares about any of this?
I just need to know
if he has a kinj or not.

06:15.333 --> 06:17.377
- I have an idea.
- Please.

06:24.550 --> 06:26.594
Raise your arms.

06:26.636 --> 06:29.180
- Don't do this.
- Now dance.

06:29.222 --> 06:31.641
No, I'm not dancing.

06:34.644 --> 06:36.396
He's fine.
You can let him out.

06:36.437 --> 06:37.980
- Are you sure?
- Mm-hmm.

06:38.022 --> 06:39.607
If he had a kinj, I wouldn't
be able to control him.

06:39.649 --> 06:41.734
And you couldn't have
thought of that any sooner?

06:41.776 --> 06:44.028
What in the gods is going on?

06:47.782 --> 06:50.284
Look, can we trust you
to stay here until we explain?

06:50.326 --> 06:52.120
I wouldn't miss it
for the world, Talon.

07:02.046 --> 07:05.007
( music playing )

07:14.058 --> 07:18.187
Your Majesty,
may I have a word?

07:18.229 --> 07:20.815
I'll leave you.
It's a honor to see you,
Priestess.

07:26.404 --> 07:28.990
Why did you not unite
with your betrothed?

07:29.031 --> 07:31.367
My kinj had not yet divided
when I was with him.

07:31.409 --> 07:34.996
You should have kept him
with you until it did.

07:35.037 --> 07:37.665
He went to clean up.
He seemed reluctant.

07:37.707 --> 07:40.585
But I expect to see him soon.

07:40.626 --> 07:43.212
His army is a threat to us.
We must not delay.

07:43.254 --> 07:45.715
Of course.
Once I have the gift
to give him,

07:45.756 --> 07:49.051
I'll take great pleasure
in sharing it, I assure you.

07:49.093 --> 07:53.222
Good. However,
we have another small problem.

07:53.264 --> 07:56.309
- What is it?
- Talon.

07:56.350 --> 08:01.022
She's resistant
to becoming United.

08:01.063 --> 08:03.399
Let me talk to her.
She listens to me.

08:03.441 --> 08:05.818
It is rather more
complex than that.

08:05.860 --> 08:09.030
We may have to kill her.

08:09.071 --> 08:11.032
Absolutely not.

08:11.073 --> 08:14.160
That's out of the question.
She's my closest friend.

08:14.202 --> 08:18.956
Rosmund,
peace and unity do not
come without a price.

08:18.998 --> 08:22.502
We shall both have
to make sacrifices to assure
complete compliance.

08:22.543 --> 08:25.671
Mine will unfortunately be Zed.

08:25.713 --> 08:29.383
You told me
you created this paradise
to avoid bloodshed.

08:29.425 --> 08:32.428
Do what you will with Zed,
but I'm the queen of this realm

08:32.470 --> 08:34.180
and I will not have you
hurt Talon.

08:34.222 --> 08:36.599
Because she cannot be United,
she is a threat to our mission.

08:36.641 --> 08:38.559
She is a dangerous killer.

08:38.601 --> 08:43.064
You do understand that,
don't you?

08:43.105 --> 08:46.067
She's always been
my loyal friend.

08:46.108 --> 08:48.819
I see.

08:48.861 --> 08:53.324
And if the choice comes down
to Talon or me?

08:53.366 --> 08:56.536
I'll do everything in my power
to avoid such a choice.

09:03.125 --> 09:05.545
But of course,
if it comes down to it,

09:05.586 --> 09:07.171
I'll choose the United.

09:07.213 --> 09:10.466
I choose you.

09:10.508 --> 09:11.759
Good.

09:25.690 --> 09:27.608
We need to figure out a way
to identify the infected.

09:27.650 --> 09:29.902
What if you capture Yavalla,
bring her here,

09:29.944 --> 09:33.406
and then Wren and I
can study her and try to
figure out how to stop this.

09:33.447 --> 09:35.449
You really think you can trust
Wren not to free her mother?

09:35.491 --> 09:37.952
- Yes. Yes, I would.
- It doesn't matter.

09:37.994 --> 09:42.373
She's guarded by Blackfists
day and night, not to mention
her Lu-Qiri and theirs.

09:42.415 --> 09:43.749
It would be
a suicide mission
to take them on.

09:43.791 --> 09:46.544
- Then why don't you do it?
- Why me?

09:46.586 --> 09:48.337
Because this is all
your fault!

09:48.379 --> 09:51.382
You are the one who forced Talon
to bring Yavalla here.

09:51.424 --> 09:53.342
I didn't force her
to do anything!

09:53.384 --> 09:56.304
Enough! All right,
we're on the same side now.

09:59.015 --> 10:00.474
I'll do it.

10:00.516 --> 10:02.268
I can't just stand here
and do nothing.

10:02.310 --> 10:04.854
- We have to save Rosmund.
- That's not such a bad idea.

10:04.895 --> 10:06.105
Rosmund will be
easier to get to.

10:06.147 --> 10:07.857
That's not what
I was suggesting.

10:07.898 --> 10:10.735
Pretend it was.
It sounds smarter.

10:10.776 --> 10:12.987
Do you have a problem
with me, Talon?

10:13.029 --> 10:15.156
How about the fact that you
betrayed my best friend?

10:15.197 --> 10:17.116
I thought I was
your best friend.

10:17.158 --> 10:18.701
Weren't you the one
who was just saying
we're on the same side?

10:22.204 --> 10:23.789
I do have free access
to Rosmund.

10:24.999 --> 10:26.542
I'll get us in.

10:26.584 --> 10:28.794
Well,
but you see the problem
there is Yavalla knows

10:28.836 --> 10:31.380
everything that Gwynn is doing.
That's how she found Garret.

10:31.422 --> 10:33.966
If you go capture Gwynn,
then Yavalla will just

10:34.008 --> 10:36.052
send everyone
she knows after us.

10:37.428 --> 10:39.263
It's what I'm counting on.

10:49.106 --> 10:50.941
Tobin, you've come back.

10:55.237 --> 10:56.864
I think I'm almost
ready for you.

10:56.906 --> 10:58.240
What does that mean?

11:02.703 --> 11:04.288
I wanted to welcome you
to the United

11:04.330 --> 11:07.416
while we make love.

11:07.458 --> 11:10.419
In the throne room?

11:10.461 --> 11:12.004
That does sound tempting,

11:12.046 --> 11:13.339
but I've got to get you
out of here, all right?

11:13.381 --> 11:15.716
- For your own safety.
- Why, Tobin?

11:15.758 --> 11:19.428
You don't have to fight
for me anymore.

11:19.470 --> 11:21.138
The Priestess assures my safety.

11:21.180 --> 11:24.141
The Priestess is controlling
you, all right?

11:24.183 --> 11:26.811
You're basically still
her prisoner.

11:26.852 --> 11:28.521
That's ridiculous.

11:28.562 --> 11:30.439
Yavalla has enlightened me.

11:30.481 --> 11:33.901
This is the only way
for peace.

11:41.951 --> 11:43.828
What are you doing?
I don't understand.

11:43.869 --> 11:46.622
If I have to force you
to come with me, I will.

11:51.919 --> 11:55.756
Sammy, you're infected, too?

11:55.798 --> 11:56.924
There's no need for violence.

11:56.966 --> 12:00.469
Just put down your sword
and join us.

12:00.511 --> 12:03.097
- I can't do that.
- I would rather
he join us than die.

12:04.890 --> 12:06.392
So try not to kill him.

12:09.103 --> 12:10.604
( whistles )

12:15.526 --> 12:17.945
- Zed?
- You lied to all of us.

12:17.987 --> 12:21.532
You are making
a grave mistake.

12:24.827 --> 12:27.872
( grunting )

12:45.639 --> 12:49.435
- Sammy!
- ( groans )

12:57.568 --> 12:59.153
Stop!

13:02.865 --> 13:04.074
She has one
of Yavalla's kinjes.

13:05.701 --> 13:07.661
You seem surprised.

13:09.288 --> 13:11.165
Yeah, because I can
control her with my kinj.

13:13.584 --> 13:14.794
Try it on Yavalla.

13:18.881 --> 13:20.299
Make them stop.

13:20.341 --> 13:22.718
( heart beating )

13:37.983 --> 13:40.903
Your little kinj
will not work on me.

13:43.322 --> 13:45.616
- Don't kill him!
- ( grunting )

13:49.245 --> 13:51.038
Leave Rosmund alone!

13:57.962 --> 13:59.296
I don't want to hurt you, Sammy.

14:01.173 --> 14:03.759
- Stop it.
- ( yelling )

14:18.315 --> 14:21.735
( gasping )

14:21.777 --> 14:23.696
Sammy?

14:27.783 --> 14:29.034
Sammy?

14:31.245 --> 14:32.288
Gwynn, I'm sorry.

14:35.708 --> 14:37.877
I had no choice.

14:40.671 --> 14:42.214
Yavalla was right.

14:43.549 --> 14:45.134
You deserve to die.

14:48.804 --> 14:51.891
Enough.
I will go willingly.

14:51.932 --> 14:53.934
Like you had a choice.

14:53.976 --> 14:56.937
Talon, you should be joining us,
not fighting us.

14:56.979 --> 14:59.607
It's never going to happen.

15:30.387 --> 15:32.181
Are you sure these soldiers
can be trusted?

15:32.222 --> 15:34.767
You said the infection's
confined to the Outpost.

15:34.808 --> 15:36.977
- Mm.
- These men were stationed
outside the gates.

15:37.019 --> 15:39.772
I brought a small force
of about 100 loyal soldiers

15:39.813 --> 15:41.607
to help with the protection
of the Outpost.

15:44.318 --> 15:45.486
It's over, Yavalla.

15:47.738 --> 15:49.865
There are other means
to my goals.

15:49.907 --> 15:51.867
And what are those
means exactly?

15:51.909 --> 15:54.286
Peaceful, non-violent ones,
Talon.

15:54.328 --> 15:55.704
Have I not made that obvious?

15:55.746 --> 15:57.665
Tobin?

16:00.542 --> 16:04.254
Tobin, my love, let me out.

16:04.296 --> 16:07.716
I know this wasn't
your idea.

16:07.758 --> 16:09.093
This doesn't seem right.

16:09.134 --> 16:11.303
We cannot have
our queen in a cage.

16:11.345 --> 16:12.638
Do you want to end up
in there with her?

16:14.932 --> 16:17.017
Right now,
she's not our queen.

16:21.355 --> 16:23.565
Zed's kinj
can't control Yavalla,

16:23.607 --> 16:25.609
but it can control
anyone she's infected.

16:25.651 --> 16:29.822
- That's right.
- Interesting.

16:29.863 --> 16:32.533
Why didn't you infect me
with one of those things
right away?

16:32.574 --> 16:33.993
I didn't have one
to give you yet.

16:36.078 --> 16:39.999
- I'm sorry.
- Wait, so-- so there
is a gestation period.

16:40.040 --> 16:42.710
Well, that explains
why the whole Outpost
hasn't been infected yet.

16:42.751 --> 16:43.794
Please.

16:46.505 --> 16:48.132
Given my calculations on
the gestation period,

16:48.173 --> 16:50.759
which is based on the time
that Gwynn was infected,

16:50.801 --> 16:54.888
carry the one,
this should be all of them.

16:54.930 --> 16:58.392
- You sure?
- Quite frankly I'm surprised
there are that many.

16:58.434 --> 17:00.019
Then I'll triple
the guards on them

17:00.060 --> 17:02.146
just in case there's any more
to try and break them out.

17:15.826 --> 17:17.202
Zed?

17:17.244 --> 17:20.581
Have I done something
to offend you?

17:20.622 --> 17:23.167
No, I just-- I didn't--

17:23.208 --> 17:28.213
- Spit it out, Zed.
- I just hope that--

17:28.255 --> 17:30.174
- I guess you should know.
- Should know what?

17:31.633 --> 17:33.427
It's your mother,
Priestess Yavalla.

17:33.469 --> 17:35.179
- We've got her behind bars.
- What?

17:35.220 --> 17:36.764
And what happened?
Is she hurt?

17:36.805 --> 17:38.807
No, no, she's not hurt.
We just-- we set a trap for her

17:38.849 --> 17:40.392
along with the others
she was controlling.

17:40.434 --> 17:41.602
Why didn't you tell me?

17:44.646 --> 17:46.982
You don't trust me.

17:47.024 --> 17:49.318
Some of the humans thought
you couldn't be objective
when it came to your mother.

17:49.359 --> 17:51.403
Oh, but you can be?
When I'm the one

17:51.445 --> 17:52.988
that had to persuade you
that she was dangerous?

17:53.030 --> 17:55.365
I've seen how she can
affect people, Wren.

17:55.407 --> 17:59.119
She controls them,
and you might be more vulnerable
because of your love for her.

17:59.161 --> 18:01.830
- I need to see her.
- You have to stay away
from her, Wren.

18:01.872 --> 18:06.126
- I need to ask her why
she's behaving this way.
- Isn't it obvious why?

18:06.168 --> 18:09.296
- That kinj is corrupting her.
- No. No, there has to be
more to it than that.

18:09.338 --> 18:11.423
You know her, Zed.
You know she's not a bad person.

18:11.465 --> 18:13.217
No one had more faith in her
than I did.

18:13.258 --> 18:15.511
I thought she was the only one
who could save our people,

18:15.552 --> 18:17.429
and then she betrayed us.

18:17.471 --> 18:19.848
We just need to get
the kinj out of her,

18:19.890 --> 18:21.100
get to the real
Priestess inside.

18:21.141 --> 18:25.229
You see?
That's what I was afraid of.

18:25.270 --> 18:27.481
You're vulnerable
to her manipulation.

18:27.523 --> 18:29.441
She could convince you
to do anything if you
thought it would save her.

18:29.483 --> 18:33.445
- No.
- You have to stay away, Wren.
Listen to me.

18:33.487 --> 18:36.031
Zed, don't you see
that I am more valuable
because I'm her daughter?

18:36.073 --> 18:39.118
I know her better than anyone.
I might be the only person
that can get through to her.

18:39.159 --> 18:43.247
She can't be gotten
through to, Wren.
She's beyond that.

18:43.288 --> 18:46.041
Look, I need to know
you'll do whatever
has to be done

18:46.083 --> 18:49.419
to fight against her
when and if the time comes.

18:50.712 --> 18:53.006
Look at me.

18:55.717 --> 18:57.636
I'll do whatever is necessary.

19:00.848 --> 19:03.267
Now go and find Janzo
and help him figure this out.

19:05.144 --> 19:06.186
All right.

19:23.370 --> 19:26.623
( fly buzzing )

19:29.334 --> 19:32.296
It makes sense that Zed
can control the offspring
to Yavalla's kinj.

19:32.337 --> 19:34.631
If they weren't
open to guidance,

19:34.673 --> 19:37.092
then Yavalla wouldn't be able
to control them either,

19:37.134 --> 19:39.303
Which means the baby kinjes
are purely subordinate
to Yavalla.

19:39.344 --> 19:40.637
That fits right into
your hive theory.

19:40.679 --> 19:42.097
Which gives us
one other opportunity

19:42.139 --> 19:45.309
- to solve this.
- What?

19:45.350 --> 19:47.352
Stingflies are subordinate
to their queen.

19:47.394 --> 19:49.605
They'll do anything
they can to protect her. Why?

19:49.646 --> 19:51.481
Because if she dies,
they're lost. They've got
no one to guide them.

19:51.523 --> 19:55.485
Exactly.
So once the queen dies,

19:55.527 --> 19:57.529
the stingflies are liberated.

19:57.571 --> 19:58.822
Uh-huh.

19:58.864 --> 20:02.659
Wren, in this case,

20:02.701 --> 20:03.785
Yavalla's the queen.

20:07.372 --> 20:09.166
You want to kill my mother?

20:09.208 --> 20:12.336
No, no, of course not.
It's just, um,

20:12.377 --> 20:14.880
it might be the only
chance to stop this.

20:14.922 --> 20:18.550
No. No.
We do the proper research,

20:18.592 --> 20:20.552
we come up with
multiple hypotheses,

20:20.594 --> 20:22.554
and we work our way
up to a solution,

20:22.596 --> 20:24.348
one that does not include
killing my mother.

20:24.389 --> 20:26.141
Okay, I agree with you
on all of those things.

20:26.183 --> 20:28.936
I'm just saying that you might
just have to brace yourself

20:28.977 --> 20:30.687
for the fact that
this might be our only way.

20:30.729 --> 20:33.774
They're not stingflies, Janzo.

20:33.815 --> 20:36.151
You have no proof that it will
work the same way, all right?

20:36.193 --> 20:37.653
You're not killing anyone.

20:37.694 --> 20:39.655
- Wren?
- No.

20:45.410 --> 20:47.704
- I really wish
you hadn't done that.
- Why?

20:47.746 --> 20:49.248
I know you really
like her, Janzo,

20:49.289 --> 20:53.418
but when it comes to
making the hard decisions,

20:53.460 --> 20:54.711
do you really think
you can trust her?

20:54.753 --> 20:57.005
I mean, she is
Yavalla's daughter.

20:57.047 --> 21:01.593
I'm sorry.
Are you jealous?

21:01.635 --> 21:05.389
Talon, Yavalla tried
to force Wren to take
one of her kinjes.

21:05.430 --> 21:08.392
Wren broke her mother's knee
to resist.

21:08.433 --> 21:10.602
I'm pretty sure
she's proven herself.

21:10.644 --> 21:12.813
Breaking her knee
and killing her are
two different things.

21:15.065 --> 21:16.692
That's all I'm saying.

21:20.529 --> 21:22.698
( groaning, panting )

21:34.459 --> 21:37.421
Why is this happening?

21:37.462 --> 21:38.630
Your kinj has divided.

21:38.672 --> 21:40.424
You have held
onto it too long.

21:40.465 --> 21:43.051
You must find someone
to unite with.

21:43.093 --> 21:45.220
The longer you wait,
the worse it gets.

21:45.262 --> 21:47.055
And what if I don't?

21:47.097 --> 21:48.515
You have many days
in which to do so.

21:48.557 --> 21:50.350
What if I don't?

21:54.313 --> 21:57.065
Eventually, it will kill you,

21:57.107 --> 22:00.444
but there is no reason
that should ever happen.

22:00.485 --> 22:02.612
( squeaking )

22:03.905 --> 22:06.033
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

22:10.746 --> 22:12.080
Shh.

22:12.122 --> 22:13.332
My Queen.

22:21.423 --> 22:23.467
( squeaking )

22:37.314 --> 22:38.940
Thank you, Priestess.

22:47.741 --> 22:48.909
Take a break.

22:55.624 --> 22:57.709
Garret.

22:57.751 --> 22:59.920
I knew you'd come
to your senses.

22:59.961 --> 23:01.630
I've come to talk
some sense into you.

23:01.671 --> 23:03.048
What do you mean?

23:03.090 --> 23:06.301
I know you. You're strong.

23:06.343 --> 23:08.845
You don't want to be
controlled by this woman.

23:08.887 --> 23:10.806
I'm not controlled by her,
Garret.

23:10.847 --> 23:12.349
Join us and
you'll understand.

23:12.391 --> 23:15.143
She is making you act against
your own self interests.

23:15.185 --> 23:20.315
Don't you see that?
I know that you are strong
enough to fight it.

23:20.357 --> 23:23.193
You can resist her control.

23:26.780 --> 23:30.200
Garret, you're right.
Please, please help me.

23:30.242 --> 23:32.786
Help me.
I think I can resist her,

23:32.828 --> 23:34.162
but you have to get me
out of here.

23:34.204 --> 23:36.957
You have to get me out
of here, Garret, please.

23:36.998 --> 23:38.500
- She's gonna...
- She's gonna kill me.

23:38.542 --> 23:40.085
- No. Gwynn--
- Get me out of here.

23:40.127 --> 23:42.295
( grunts )

23:42.337 --> 23:44.798
- ( gasping )
Let go! Let go!
- Shh.

23:57.853 --> 23:59.729
You've killed her!

24:01.565 --> 24:03.442
Good riddance.

24:09.406 --> 24:11.741
Gwynn?

24:11.783 --> 24:14.703
Now that she's gone,
how do you feel?

24:14.744 --> 24:17.998
Are you free of her? Gwynn?

24:27.674 --> 24:30.886
No. No, it's not possible.

24:30.927 --> 24:34.723
My dear child,
you have no idea
what's possible.

24:53.283 --> 24:55.243
( squeaking )

25:52.842 --> 25:53.885
He's coming.

25:57.347 --> 26:00.016
Can you see through
all of our eyes all of the time?

26:00.058 --> 26:03.019
Only if I make
a purposeful connection.

26:03.061 --> 26:05.605
I do not think my mind
could tolerate linking
with you all at once.

26:05.647 --> 26:07.107
Not yet.

26:10.235 --> 26:11.278
Janzo?

26:13.780 --> 26:18.159
- Janzo.
- What happened? Garret?

26:18.201 --> 26:19.911
Garret, have you been infected?
Please stay away.

26:19.953 --> 26:21.538
Garret, please just stay--
I'm being serious.

26:21.580 --> 26:23.039
- Stay away!
- I'm not infected.

26:23.081 --> 26:27.877
- I'm not.
- What happened?

26:27.919 --> 26:30.380
What did you do to your hand?

26:30.422 --> 26:34.259
Oh, I tested your theory
about the hive and the queen.

26:34.301 --> 26:35.719
- I stabbed Yavalla.
- You did what?

26:35.760 --> 26:37.512
It was self defense.
That's not important.

26:37.554 --> 26:39.431
- What is important--
- Wren's going to be crushed.

26:39.472 --> 26:40.724
Wren is not going to be crushed

26:40.765 --> 26:43.143
because Yavalla
is very much alive!

26:43.184 --> 26:46.730
She healed completely
right before my eyes, Janzo.

26:46.771 --> 26:49.190
Do you realize how stupid
that was of you to do?

26:49.232 --> 26:51.401
- You could have killed everyone
infected, including Gwynn.
- No, listen, I--

26:51.443 --> 26:53.528
Janzo, you're not
listening to me.

26:53.570 --> 26:57.282
Yavalla cannot die.

27:00.910 --> 27:04.497
Ah. Right.

27:06.416 --> 27:09.419
Stay away, and tell me
everything you know.

27:12.047 --> 27:13.381
Commander Aegisford.

27:13.423 --> 27:14.924
I'm so sorry.
We had a breach.

27:14.966 --> 27:17.510
Garret Spears visited us
a little while ago and--

27:19.679 --> 27:22.766
This is the price
you pay for failure.

27:22.807 --> 27:24.351
The rest of you are with me.

27:41.034 --> 27:44.204
Paradise is within you.
I can feel it.

27:44.245 --> 27:46.081
I have to get you
out of here.

27:50.043 --> 27:52.671
( heart beating )

28:06.351 --> 28:07.811
( groaning )

28:07.852 --> 28:09.104
Yeah.

28:12.482 --> 28:15.360
( muttering )

28:20.657 --> 28:23.410
You go that way,
and I'll go this way. Yeah.

28:23.451 --> 28:25.745
- Munt!
- Sorry.

28:25.787 --> 28:27.997
- You all right?
- What?

28:28.039 --> 28:30.834
- Why wouldn't I be all right?
- Well, you're making fists,

28:30.875 --> 28:32.419
and then you're talking
to yourself and--

28:32.460 --> 28:34.003
and the veins in your neck
are sticking out.

28:34.045 --> 28:35.630
- I'm fine.
- Yeah.

28:35.672 --> 28:38.216
I mean, I'm not.
I'm not at all right.

28:38.258 --> 28:39.843
Munt, can I ask you a question?

28:39.884 --> 28:43.263
What would you do if someone
suggested killing your mother?

28:43.304 --> 28:45.557
- She's already dead.
- Right.

28:45.598 --> 28:49.978
Sorry. But if she wasn't?

28:50.019 --> 28:51.855
Are you saying
someone is trying

28:51.896 --> 28:53.314
to raise her from the dead
so they can kill her again?

28:53.356 --> 28:54.858
No. Munt, no.
No, that's not what I'm saying.

28:54.899 --> 28:57.110
Oh, you mean if someone
suggested killing her?

28:57.152 --> 29:02.115
- Yes. Yes.
- I would break every bone
in their body.

29:02.157 --> 29:04.325
I would take their skull
and squeeze it till
their eyes popped out!

29:04.367 --> 29:07.162
- And I'd rip them in half!
- Oh, that's exactly
what I would do.

29:07.203 --> 29:09.414
- Yeah!
- No, not exactly.

29:09.456 --> 29:11.958
So why didn't I?

29:12.000 --> 29:14.711
He's completely self-obsessed.

29:14.753 --> 29:17.255
He's oblivious.
He's downright obtuse
is what he is.

29:17.297 --> 29:19.799
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

29:19.841 --> 29:22.093
I don't know any of them
words you just said,

29:22.135 --> 29:25.096
- but do you need a hug?
- Absolutely not.

29:25.138 --> 29:26.806
- Yeah, you do. Come here.
- No, Munt. Munt!

29:26.848 --> 29:29.851
I don't need a hug! Munt!

29:29.893 --> 29:32.020
I want to kill him!
I want to kill him.

29:32.061 --> 29:34.898
Better leave you to it then.

29:34.939 --> 29:36.691
- Who are we talking
about killing?
- Don't worry about it.

29:36.733 --> 29:40.111
Is it someone I know?
It's Janzo, isn't it?

29:40.153 --> 29:42.614
- How do you know that?
- I always want to kill Janzo.

29:42.655 --> 29:46.493
But I can't because, you know,
him being my brother.

29:46.534 --> 29:48.536
- Ooh, I can't have you
kill my brother.
- Don't worry, Munt.

29:48.578 --> 29:51.748
I'm not going to kill Janzo.
I want to, but I also don't,

29:51.790 --> 29:54.667
which is why I'm so confused
and flustered and incoherent.

29:54.709 --> 29:56.044
Ooh! I know one of them words.

29:56.085 --> 29:57.629
Go away, Munt.
I need to think.

29:57.670 --> 29:59.130
Give me your word
you won't kill Janzo.

29:59.172 --> 30:01.841
Go away.

30:01.883 --> 30:03.927
- I--
- Go away!

30:03.968 --> 30:05.261
Yeah, I'm just gonna--

30:12.685 --> 30:14.020
Can I talk to you
about something?

30:14.062 --> 30:16.898
- Of course.
- Ahem.

30:16.940 --> 30:19.442
My whole life,
if someone had suggested to me,

30:19.484 --> 30:21.027
logically though
it may have been,

30:21.069 --> 30:24.364
that we should kill my mother,
I would have been enraged.

30:24.405 --> 30:26.115
I would have killed that
person right there and then.

30:26.157 --> 30:30.328
But with you,
it just made me feel very sad,

30:30.370 --> 30:31.746
- and I don't know what
to do about that.
- Wren, I'm sorry.

30:31.788 --> 30:33.164
No, no, no.
Please let me finish.

30:33.206 --> 30:36.584
So, I sat down
and I did a weighted analysis

30:36.626 --> 30:38.962
as to why my emotions
were responding the way
that they were,

30:39.003 --> 30:42.340
why my heart was
beating abnormally fast,
why my skin was flushing.

30:42.382 --> 30:45.301
And I came to the conclusion
that it's because...

30:48.805 --> 30:49.848
It's because I'm in love.

30:54.018 --> 30:55.979
I think that's
the most romantic thing

30:56.020 --> 30:58.648
anyone's ever said to me.

30:58.690 --> 31:00.608
Have you ever--

31:00.650 --> 31:04.571
uh, have you ever been
in a relationship before?

31:04.612 --> 31:06.614
Have you-- have you
ever been in love before?

31:06.656 --> 31:09.993
Mm-hmm.
Once, with my sister.

31:10.034 --> 31:12.787
- Sorry?
- Sorry. I didn't know
she was my sister.

31:12.829 --> 31:14.539
As soon as we found out,
it was over, but, yes.

31:14.581 --> 31:17.000
We were in love,
and it was quite sad
when it ended.

31:18.042 --> 31:20.962
Well, this is the first time.

31:21.004 --> 31:24.883
I mean, the only time
I've ever felt this way.

31:24.924 --> 31:27.260
I'm afraid
I'm not very good at it.

31:28.261 --> 31:29.971
I think you're perfect at it.

31:37.061 --> 31:40.106
Uh, this is when you say
that you feel the same way.

31:40.148 --> 31:44.736
Isn't it obvious?
Of course I feel the same way.

31:44.777 --> 31:47.322
And for what it's worth,
killing your mom
won't work anyway.

31:50.825 --> 31:52.785
On second thought,
maybe I will kill you.

31:52.827 --> 31:55.455
I'm sorry, it's just--
I had to get back

31:55.496 --> 31:56.873
to the issue at hand,
didn't I?

31:56.915 --> 31:58.249
Otherwise this relationship,

31:58.291 --> 32:00.209
well, it will only last
one more week

32:00.251 --> 32:01.669
before the whole world
is overtaken.

32:01.711 --> 32:03.004
Yes, you do have a point.

32:03.046 --> 32:05.924
But how do you know,
about my mother, I mean?

32:05.965 --> 32:10.470
Ah. Yes, right. Well, um,
she attacked Garret and, uh,

32:10.511 --> 32:12.180
he didn't really have
any other choice.

32:12.221 --> 32:14.140
- So he had to stab her.
- What?

32:14.182 --> 32:15.683
- She's fine.
- How?

32:15.725 --> 32:19.312
Wren, your mother can't die.

32:20.313 --> 32:23.691
( stammering )

32:23.733 --> 32:25.652
I don't underst--

32:25.693 --> 32:28.321
- I have to go and see her.
- Wait. No, no, no, no, no.

32:28.363 --> 32:30.114
I don't think
that's a very good idea.

32:30.156 --> 32:33.409
With all this new information--
with all this new information,

32:33.451 --> 32:36.287
- she's even more dangerous.
- She is in a jail cell, Janzo.

32:36.329 --> 32:38.498
She can't possible get to me.

32:38.539 --> 32:40.959
Then I'm coming with you.

32:54.639 --> 32:55.682
The blood's almost dry.

32:55.723 --> 32:57.850
This happened hours ago.

33:02.605 --> 33:05.316
They broke into my quarters
and stole their Lu-Qiri rings.

33:05.358 --> 33:07.527
How'd they get out
in the first place?

33:07.568 --> 33:09.320
I thought you said you had
all in infected imprisoned.

33:09.362 --> 33:11.739
I thought we did.
Mathematically,
it seemed certain.

33:11.781 --> 33:14.075
Maybe we miscalculated
the rate of gestation.

33:14.117 --> 33:16.786
Hey, how are you feeling
about the state of the world
right now?

33:16.828 --> 33:19.455
I don't have to answer
to human scum.

33:19.497 --> 33:21.749
- He's not infected.
- Did you let them out?

33:21.791 --> 33:23.710
- Of course.
- Where did they go?

33:23.751 --> 33:27.130
I don't know.
The Priestess Yavalla
gave me a direct order

33:27.171 --> 33:29.424
to let her pass along with
the human queen, her man--

33:29.465 --> 33:32.343
Excuse me, what? Her man?
The Queen and her man?

33:32.385 --> 33:33.803
Her man Lord Tobin
of Aegisford?

33:33.845 --> 33:38.599
- Yeah, that's him.
- Tobin's infected.

33:42.979 --> 33:45.898
There's no sign of them.
They're long gone.

33:47.734 --> 33:48.776
Oh, no.

33:56.826 --> 33:58.494
Tobin took his army with him.

33:58.536 --> 33:59.871
That army was our best chance.

34:09.255 --> 34:11.340
Gods only knows how many
have already been infected.

34:11.382 --> 34:14.093
They're gonna be spreading
all of Yavalla's goodies
all over the Realm

34:14.135 --> 34:16.429
- and it's all my fault.
- How is it your fault?

34:16.471 --> 34:20.183
Well, obviously
I miscalculated the rate
of gestation and infection.

34:20.224 --> 34:22.935
We missed an infected someone
who helped them escape.

34:22.977 --> 34:26.606
I calculated it
in the same way,
so it's both our fault.

34:26.647 --> 34:29.692
For all we know,
that infected someone
is still around us.

34:29.734 --> 34:30.777
Orrin: Zed!

34:34.614 --> 34:37.825
We heard the Priestess
has left the Outpost
with the human queen.

34:37.867 --> 34:41.287
- That's true.
- The Blackfist should be going
with her to protect her.

34:41.329 --> 34:44.415
Why the Blackfist?
So you can torture and kill
more innocents?

34:44.457 --> 34:45.583
- You'll be the first I--
- Enough!

34:49.462 --> 34:52.173
Is it true our Queen went
with Yavalla as her prisoner?

34:52.215 --> 34:55.885
- And Lord Aegisford?
- They weren't prisoners.

35:00.723 --> 35:04.560
- He's supposed to be dead.
- As you can see,
I'm very much alive.

35:04.602 --> 35:06.646
- Not for much longer!
- Put away your swords.

35:06.687 --> 35:08.439
All of you!

35:08.481 --> 35:11.067
Just long enough
to hear us out.

35:11.109 --> 35:12.318
Make it fast.

35:15.446 --> 35:18.116
There are bigger issues
at play here than just revenge.

35:20.076 --> 35:23.121
Yavalla has infected
Queen Rosmund,
Tobin Aegisford,

35:23.162 --> 35:26.290
and all of her Blackbloods
that accompany her with kinjes.

35:26.332 --> 35:28.668
Now, that makes them
all her puppets.

35:28.709 --> 35:31.754
- Why should we believe you?
- Believe me.

35:31.796 --> 35:34.632
Yavalla's daughter,
her blood.

35:34.674 --> 35:38.219
Everything that Zed says
is true.

35:38.261 --> 35:40.346
And what about the paradise
Yavalla promised us?

35:40.388 --> 35:43.182
Yavalla lied to all of us.
There is no paradise.

35:46.644 --> 35:48.437
Yavalla can control anyone
who has one of her kinjes.

35:48.479 --> 35:51.691
And those who have kinjes
can spread them to others.

35:51.732 --> 35:53.067
Yavalla's idea of paradise

35:53.109 --> 35:56.320
is complete control
over all of us.

35:56.362 --> 35:58.447
We'll ride to warn our people
of the impending danger.

35:58.489 --> 36:00.491
Until we find a cure,

36:00.533 --> 36:02.160
it is not safe for anyone
to leave the Outpost.

36:02.201 --> 36:04.120
You are no one's commander.

36:04.162 --> 36:06.706
- He's ours.
- Hey, shut up!

36:09.750 --> 36:12.879
Now you've
all known me as an ally
at one time or another.

36:12.920 --> 36:14.922
I've lived among humans
and Blackbloods.

36:14.964 --> 36:17.258
- You know I speak truth.
- So what say you?

36:17.300 --> 36:20.386
Why should we listen to her?
She's a traitor.

36:20.428 --> 36:21.721
- Traitor!
- Yeah!

36:21.762 --> 36:23.639
Shut up.

36:23.681 --> 36:26.893
Yavalla's promise,
what we've all said we wanted,

36:26.934 --> 36:29.645
was for humans and Blackbloods
to live and work in harmony.

36:29.687 --> 36:32.315
- Is that right?
- All: Yeah.

36:33.524 --> 36:35.067
So then why don't
we just do it?

36:36.027 --> 36:38.279
We don't need Yavalla.

36:38.321 --> 36:41.574
Humans and Blackbloods,
of all the times,

36:41.616 --> 36:43.659
this is the time
to come together.

36:43.701 --> 36:46.078
What would we do?

36:46.120 --> 36:49.540
We'll find a way to stop
Yavalla from turning us
all into her puppets,

36:49.582 --> 36:51.125
but we need to do it
together.

36:51.167 --> 36:52.835
Talon should take charge.

36:52.877 --> 36:54.462
I'm not much of a leader.

36:54.503 --> 36:56.214
You might have to be.

37:06.390 --> 37:09.352
Fine. I'll do it until
we solve this crisis.

37:09.393 --> 37:12.188
Garret Spears will be my
sub-commander for the humans,

37:12.230 --> 37:14.607
and Zed will be the same
for the Blackbloods--

37:14.649 --> 37:17.652
and that includes Blackfists.

37:19.987 --> 37:21.239
What say you?

37:24.909 --> 37:28.913
( chanting )
Talon! Talon! Talon!

37:33.042 --> 37:35.169
Blackbloods, what say you?

37:35.211 --> 37:40.258
( chanting )
Talon! Talon! Talon!

37:45.471 --> 37:48.808
I never thought Blackfists would
want to be enslaved by anyone,

37:48.849 --> 37:49.934
much less one of their own.

37:51.894 --> 37:54.480
I assure you,
Yavalla's intent is no less.

38:02.446 --> 38:05.908
For now, the Blackfists
will follow Talon.

38:11.080 --> 38:14.125
I guess you're the new boss.

38:14.166 --> 38:16.043
Unfortunately.

38:38.190 --> 38:39.233
( squeaking )

38:44.071 --> 38:47.533
What are you doing?

38:47.575 --> 38:50.036
- ( squeaking )
- Ugh! What is that rat doing?

38:50.077 --> 38:51.662
It was coming
straight for your face.
I saved you.

38:51.704 --> 38:55.249
- But how did you see it?
- I stare at you when you sleep.

38:55.291 --> 38:57.960
Not in a creepy way,
just a protective way.

38:59.128 --> 39:01.464
Rats generally
don't seek people out.

39:01.505 --> 39:03.591
- They're scared of us.
- I know.

39:10.056 --> 39:11.098
But look.

39:20.524 --> 39:23.069
It was going to pass me a kinj.

39:23.110 --> 39:25.112
Maybe that's how
the others escaped.

39:25.154 --> 39:29.617
A rat could have
infected a guard or a--

39:29.658 --> 39:31.494
Tobin.

39:39.335 --> 39:41.712
It's staring at me.

39:41.754 --> 39:43.756
It's bloody staring at me.

39:46.092 --> 39:49.136
Gods, I feel like my mother
is looking right at me.

39:53.015 --> 39:53.974
- Wait.
- Huh?

39:54.016 --> 39:55.434
She must have sent it.

39:55.476 --> 39:57.603
She can see everything
that we're doing.

40:03.484 --> 40:05.569
We have to go after Yavalla
and Gwynn now.

40:08.864 --> 40:11.534
We don't even know
what direction they went.

40:11.575 --> 40:13.411
Well, think about it.

40:15.579 --> 40:17.581
If you were Yavalla
seeking total domination,

40:17.623 --> 40:18.833
where's the first place
you would go?

40:21.043 --> 40:22.086
The capital.

40:23.796 --> 40:26.173
We have to leave immediately.

40:31.011 --> 40:33.973
- What are you going to do
if you catch up to them?
- I don't know.

40:34.014 --> 40:37.893
But we have to do something
before it gets out of control,

40:37.935 --> 40:39.270
if it isn't already.

41:01.834 --> 41:05.963
- May I help you?
- I'm Queen Rosmund.

41:06.005 --> 41:08.841
And what brings you
all this way, Your Highness?

41:08.883 --> 41:12.595
We've come to bring peace
to your village.

41:12.636 --> 41:14.221
I'm afraid I don't understand.

41:17.641 --> 41:19.894
- Blackbloods.
- They will not hurt you.

41:19.935 --> 41:23.022
- They are with me now.
- We don't want any trouble.

41:25.065 --> 41:26.609
Join us.

41:26.650 --> 41:28.444
Become United
with your Queen.

41:50.090 --> 41:51.300
They are good.

41:52.468 --> 41:55.137
Take their hands in Unity.
