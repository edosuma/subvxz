00:10.969 --> 00:13.639
(Frasier) Hello, Steven, I'm listening.

00:13.805 --> 00:19.645
(Steven) 'We're having a baby
and there seems to be different advice

00:19.853 --> 00:23.941
'about whether it's OK to let your kid
get into bed with you in the morning.'

00:24.107 --> 00:26.527
Stop right there, Steven. It's OK.

00:26.693 --> 00:31.532
All relationships require close and
undivided attention, don't they, Roz?

00:31.698 --> 00:32.991
Uh-huh.

00:35.202 --> 00:39.331
'What if you and your wife
enjoy making love in the mornings?'

00:39.498 --> 00:44.545
Trust me, after the baby comes,
that won't be an issue any more.

00:45.504 --> 00:50.551
This is Dr Frasier Crane on KACL.
We'll be back after these messages.

00:50.717 --> 00:53.303
Roz, how can you be reading now?

00:53.512 --> 00:57.891
It's something I picked up
in elementary school, and it stuck.

00:58.058 --> 01:01.812
- What is so captivating?
- "Slow Tango In South Seattle".

01:01.979 --> 01:04.815
Every woman I see
is carrying that book.

01:04.982 --> 01:08.986
It's impossible to put down.
Read the first paragraph.

01:09.152 --> 01:11.613
I guarantee you'll be hooked.

01:12.906 --> 01:17.703
"There are tangos that come flowing
from the wine-coloured sea...

01:18.871 --> 01:22.249
"from the rust
of a hundred sunken ships.

01:22.416 --> 01:24.543
"This is one of those dances."

01:25.460 --> 01:28.130
- Well?
- There are books...

01:29.089 --> 01:34.928
that make your stomach rumble
and thrust your lunch ever upward!

01:37.264 --> 01:40.017
This is one of those books!

01:40.976 --> 01:44.104
You men are all alike -
you have no soul.

01:44.271 --> 01:48.400
Except for this one - the future
Mr Roz Doyle, Thomas Jay Fallow.

01:48.567 --> 01:51.153
- My God, it's him!
- Do you know him?

01:51.320 --> 01:55.365
Yes. He used to drop into a bar
I frequented in Boston.

01:55.532 --> 02:00.120
A bit pretentious, though -
stuck out like a sore thumb.

02:00.996 --> 02:04.166
You used to drink
with Thomas Jay Fallow?

02:04.333 --> 02:07.961
I helped him get through
his writer's block.

02:08.127 --> 02:12.466
In future, I'll remember
to use my powers for good, not evil.

02:12.633 --> 02:15.177
I don't care what you think.

02:15.344 --> 02:19.348
He's on "Bookchat" tomorrow
and you're introducing him.

02:19.515 --> 02:24.311
No! I'd have to say I liked his book.
It's hard to lie to someone's face.

02:24.478 --> 02:29.858
No, it's easy for someone as bright,
charming and articulate as you.

02:30.025 --> 02:32.736
Well, perhaps you're right.

02:34.112 --> 02:36.490
See how easy it is?

02:39.743 --> 02:41.787
(Eddie growls)

02:41.954 --> 02:48.752
- Eight, nine... Stop it, Eddie!
- He just wants to play.

02:48.919 --> 02:52.422
Yeah, well, therapy is not a game.
Stop it! Stop it, I said!

02:52.589 --> 02:54.508
(Doorbell rings)

02:54.675 --> 02:58.554
If he keeps this up,
there's no point to these exercises.

02:58.762 --> 03:00.180
Attaboy!

03:02.224 --> 03:04.184
- Hello, Dr Crane.
- Hello, Daphne.

03:04.393 --> 03:07.646
- Hey, Niles!
- Ah, doing your exercises.

03:07.855 --> 03:10.315
Yes, and if someone doesn't let us
get on with them,

03:10.482 --> 03:13.777
he'll get a spank on his fanny.

03:15.000 --> 03:21.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:23.620 --> 03:25.664
Don't...don't let me...

03:25.831 --> 03:29.877
- Unless you want to!
- What's up?

03:30.043 --> 03:36.216
In your room, I noticed you had
pictures of Frasier and Frederick

03:36.466 --> 03:41.471
and an autographed one from someone
named Ken Griffey Jr, but...

03:41.680 --> 03:44.975
none of Maris and me.
So I brought you this.

03:45.184 --> 03:47.019
Thanks.

03:47.186 --> 03:51.023
Why is Maris wearing jodhpurs?
Taken up horse riding?

03:51.148 --> 03:54.359
No, she wanted to,
but her quadriceps are so tight

03:54.526 --> 03:58.405
she can't straddle anything
larger than a Border collie.

04:05.454 --> 04:09.249
- I can't believe this!
- What are you yapping about?

04:09.416 --> 04:12.544
This book!
It's written by a man I knew.

04:12.711 --> 04:16.255
He's taken something
I told him in confidence

04:16.423 --> 04:19.091
and turned it into this trash!

04:19.259 --> 04:22.429
"Slow Tango"?
I've just started reading that.

04:22.596 --> 04:26.225
You mean to tell me
that young man is based on you?

04:26.433 --> 04:30.437
Yes. But did Thomas Jay Fallow
have the grace to thank me? No!

04:30.604 --> 04:33.857
- Not even in the acknowledgements!
- What's it about?

04:34.066 --> 04:37.277
- That is not important.
- His first time.

04:39.905 --> 04:44.117
- Thank you, Daphne!
- Your first time doing what?

04:46.787 --> 04:49.623
Changing a flat tyre!

04:51.458 --> 04:56.004
So this whole book's about
the night you conceived Frederick!

04:56.171 --> 04:59.675
You'll be happy to know
that was not my first time.

04:59.883 --> 05:02.594
And that it wasn't your only time!

05:05.138 --> 05:09.017
- Who was this charitable lass?
- That is not important.

05:09.226 --> 05:12.104
- His piano teacher.
- His piano teacher?

05:12.312 --> 05:14.356
Thanks again, Daphne!

05:14.523 --> 05:18.735
It's no secret.
It's all there in black and white.

05:18.902 --> 05:21.405
About your awkward teenage lunging,

05:21.572 --> 05:25.242
and how you used to call
your chest hair your "rug of love".

05:27.244 --> 05:29.830
He did take some literary licence.

05:30.080 --> 05:35.919
So you can't bring a woman to ecstasy
with your panther-like prowess?

05:37.421 --> 05:40.174
That part he got right.

05:40.382 --> 05:44.928
This really fries me. That woman
taking advantage of my kid.

05:45.095 --> 05:49.600
I paid $10 a week for piano lessons
so you could get your hedge trimmed.

05:52.352 --> 05:55.439
Wait a minute!
Not Miss Warner?

05:55.689 --> 05:59.193
This wasn't going on
during your lessons, too?

05:59.359 --> 06:04.656
No, while Frasier was getting his
Rachmaninoffs, I was studying music!

06:05.616 --> 06:10.787
Now, look! This was not some tawdry
older woman lusting after young flesh!

06:12.831 --> 06:15.459
Clarice and I cared for each other.

06:15.626 --> 06:18.712
She showed me a world
I'd never known.

06:19.296 --> 06:23.133
And wouldn't know again
for six and a half years.

06:25.135 --> 06:30.724
It's true. As Mr Fallow put it,
she saw your sensitive, poetic side

06:30.891 --> 06:35.312
and you couldn't help noticing
how her bosom brushed your cheek

06:35.479 --> 06:37.523
when she reached for the metronome.

06:37.731 --> 06:42.069
How can a man who drank so heavily
remember so much?

06:43.403 --> 06:48.116
- Yet forgets who told him the story.
- He'll get a little reminder today.

06:49.868 --> 06:52.621
- No, no!
- I want it. Give it to me.

06:54.039 --> 06:56.834
"I budded when you kissed me.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.419
"I withered when you left me.

06:59.586 --> 07:03.006
"I bloomed a few months
while you loved me."

07:03.173 --> 07:07.261
- Would you calm down?
- When I've exacted my pound of flesh.

07:07.427 --> 07:09.471
Wait till I get my book signed.

07:09.638 --> 07:12.474
- Let me. It's my story.
- Stop it!

07:12.641 --> 07:16.520
You haven't told anyone?
They'd have a field day.

07:16.687 --> 07:20.274
Frasier, give me credit
for a little discretion.

07:20.440 --> 07:24.486
Hey, piano boy!
Way to pound those ivories!

07:27.322 --> 07:31.451
Listen! It's imperative
that this not be commonly known.

07:31.618 --> 07:33.912
Hey, Doc, it's no big deal.

07:35.622 --> 07:41.170
Anything for you? I've still got some
feeling on the other side of my head.

07:41.336 --> 07:44.173
I had a similar experience
when I was 16.

07:44.339 --> 07:48.093
An older woman introduced me
to the mysteries of love.

07:48.260 --> 07:50.971
Of course, she was a hooker.

07:51.180 --> 07:54.308
It was a birthday present
from my dad, OK?

07:55.058 --> 07:57.394
Want to know the ironic thing?

07:57.561 --> 08:00.355
All I wanted was a bike.

08:04.610 --> 08:07.738
How could you expect me
not to tell anybody?

08:07.905 --> 08:12.367
You can't keep something like that
bottled up. I only told one person.

08:12.576 --> 08:15.412
- Hello, Frasier, Roz!
- Hi.

08:15.579 --> 08:19.583
I was doing my restaurant review
this afternoon

08:19.750 --> 08:24.254
when I came up with the
perfect sandwich, named after you:

08:24.421 --> 08:26.465
Frasier Crane's Double Decker.

08:26.632 --> 08:31.512
It consists of aged pheasant,
spring chicken and plenty of tongue.

08:33.263 --> 08:37.601
Listen! "I wept as our bodies
made the music of love."

08:37.768 --> 08:40.604
"I'm your rhapsody. Play me."

08:40.770 --> 08:44.316
"Crescendo, my young maestro,
crescendo."

08:44.483 --> 08:49.029
"My vessel yearns to dock
in the magnificence of your harbour."

08:50.364 --> 08:52.407
That's not in the book.

08:54.201 --> 08:56.203
One thing I must ask you -

08:56.411 --> 08:59.915
what was your inspiration
for this love story?

09:00.082 --> 09:02.209
Ooh! It's his last chance!

09:03.210 --> 09:06.505
It was actually given to me by God.

09:06.672 --> 09:08.757
By God!

09:08.924 --> 09:13.011
Do you believe his grandiosity?
I'm God, and he knows it!

09:13.178 --> 09:17.474
We'll be back with the divinely inspired
Thomas Jay Fallow

09:17.683 --> 09:19.810
right after this break.

09:21.395 --> 09:27.484
Excuse me. I want to call my husband
and see if he can take a long lunch.

09:31.029 --> 09:33.448
Thomas Jay Fallow.

09:34.867 --> 09:36.743
Frasier!

09:36.910 --> 09:39.496
Frasier Crane! I can't believe it!

09:39.663 --> 09:43.709
I see my name hasn't entirely escaped
your sieve-like memory.

09:43.876 --> 09:47.921
- Why would it?
- It's not in your acknowledgements,

09:48.088 --> 09:50.549
you egomaniacal thief!

09:50.716 --> 09:53.093
You read my book!

09:54.052 --> 09:56.638
I didn't have to read it. I lived it.

09:56.805 --> 10:00.809
Not that anybody would know that
from your acknowledgements.

10:00.976 --> 10:04.605
You mention your kindergarten teacher,
but not me!

10:04.771 --> 10:07.691
I only gave you the story
which you have merchandised

10:07.858 --> 10:11.695
into this $1,000,000 treacle machine!

10:13.363 --> 10:15.782
I'm finished now.

10:17.201 --> 10:19.244
I'm so sorry.

10:19.953 --> 10:24.041
I don't know how I could have been
so thoughtless.

10:29.713 --> 10:32.549
- I owe you everything!
- Oh, no, no!

10:34.510 --> 10:38.972
Oh, my God! Frasier,
what did you do to the poor man?

10:39.139 --> 10:43.727
- What happened?
- Frasier made him cry.

10:48.982 --> 10:52.694
"Slow Tango" has put thoughts
in Maris' head.

10:52.861 --> 10:56.782
I found her cooing over the student
who skims the koi pond.

10:57.991 --> 11:01.787
- I wouldn't concern myself.
- It's innocent flirting?

11:01.954 --> 11:04.790
No. I just wouldn't concern myself.

11:09.169 --> 11:11.213
- Hey, Frasier.
- Hi, Dad, Niles.

11:11.380 --> 11:17.719
Congratulations. Maris heard Thomas
Fallow acknowledge his debt to you.

11:17.928 --> 11:21.056
Yes, I had a chat with him
this afternoon.

11:21.223 --> 11:24.434
- Was he properly contrite?
- I made him cry.

11:24.601 --> 11:26.728
That's my boy!

11:28.689 --> 11:31.233
You must be feeling pretty good.

11:31.400 --> 11:35.863
Actually, the incident
has left me strangely unsatisfied.

11:37.281 --> 11:42.661
I still feel sort of empty. I've been
turning it around in my mind all day.

11:42.828 --> 11:47.249
You kill me. You got what you want
and you're still not happy.

11:47.457 --> 11:51.003
Frasier, life is not hard.
You make it hard.

11:51.170 --> 11:55.632
You don't just enjoy things.
You analyse everything.

11:55.799 --> 11:57.217
(Eddie growls)

11:57.384 --> 12:01.096
You could learn a big lesson
from this dog here.

12:01.263 --> 12:04.975
You know what makes him happy?
A sock.

12:06.059 --> 12:08.103
Come on, Eddie.

12:12.149 --> 12:15.944
What's troubling you goes deeper
than your usual malaise.

12:16.111 --> 12:19.615
- (Daphne) Shame on you!
- What for?

12:19.781 --> 12:21.909
You just ran out on her!

12:22.117 --> 12:26.205
"Leaving her bed as empty
as a swallow's nest in fall."

12:26.371 --> 12:29.500
And you ask me what for!

12:31.710 --> 12:34.671
I'd just been accepted to Harvard.

12:34.922 --> 12:39.134
So you just leave in the night
without so much as a kiss.

12:39.343 --> 12:43.222
- You never said goodbye?
- She was sleeping so peacefully.

12:45.307 --> 12:47.559
She had an early lesson.

12:49.645 --> 12:51.688
I left a rose on her pillow.

12:52.439 --> 12:54.691
- Aha.
- "Aha" what?

12:54.858 --> 12:59.238
- "Aha" this: I have a theory.
- Why else would you say "aha"?

12:59.404 --> 13:03.534
You were angry at Thomas Fallow
for not thanking you

13:03.742 --> 13:08.038
for your contribution to his life.
But you're really angry at yourself

13:08.205 --> 13:12.000
for not thanking Miss Warner
for her contribution to your life.

13:12.960 --> 13:15.796
I was only 17.
I'm sure she understood.

13:16.505 --> 13:20.759
Perhaps she didn't. She was
vulnerable, lonely, middle-aged.

13:20.926 --> 13:23.929
It's possible her feelings for you
ran deep,

13:24.054 --> 13:28.600
feelings you crushed when you left
without a thank you or a goodbye.

13:28.767 --> 13:31.436
Yes, well, thank you and goodbye.

13:34.106 --> 13:38.569
All right. Fine.
I'll just leave you with this thought:

13:38.735 --> 13:42.030
your encounter with Fallow
was unsatisfactory

13:42.197 --> 13:44.241
because it didn't provide closure.

13:44.408 --> 13:49.163
For that, you will have to make amends
with Miss Warner. Aha.

13:57.379 --> 13:59.631
Very funny, Dad!

14:03.635 --> 14:06.263
(Frasier)
"He had been a teenage Balboa,

14:06.430 --> 14:11.935
"an explorer of the rising pinnacles
and gently curving slopes of my body.

14:12.144 --> 14:15.063
"In one explosive burst of discovery,

14:15.230 --> 14:19.610
"he had staked claim to
the Pacific Ocean that was my soul.

14:19.818 --> 14:22.112
"But now, he was leaving,

14:22.321 --> 14:27.659
"going, vanishing, like
a solitary boat on the lonely horizon,

14:27.826 --> 14:32.122
"departing like a train,
rolling ceaselessly through the night,

14:32.289 --> 14:34.791
"exiting swiftly like..."

14:47.804 --> 14:50.807
"And so, he was gone."

15:01.235 --> 15:05.531
"Now, in the cool of the evening,
I play my piano,

15:05.697 --> 15:08.909
"and his last words
resonate through the notes:

15:09.243 --> 15:13.330
"I'll come back to you,
my cherished one.'

15:14.248 --> 15:16.625
"But he never did.

15:16.792 --> 15:19.962
"And all that remains of him
are the withered petals

15:20.128 --> 15:23.924
"of the rose he left upon my pillow."

15:39.523 --> 15:42.651
("The Blue Danube" plays)

15:50.701 --> 15:52.578
Clarice.

15:53.120 --> 15:56.373
Time, the subtle thief of youth.

16:09.219 --> 16:12.055
Hello. May I help you?

16:12.306 --> 16:15.142
- Ms Warner?
- Yes.

16:15.392 --> 16:18.645
I... I'm Frasier Crane.

16:20.147 --> 16:23.692
I'm sorry,
my memory's not what it used to be.

16:23.859 --> 16:26.278
But, please, come in.

16:26.486 --> 16:30.490
- Would you like to sit down?
- Yes, I would.

16:31.491 --> 16:34.286
So, we know each other?

16:35.454 --> 16:39.082
Well, we were friends.

16:39.833 --> 16:43.337
More than friends.
You really don't remember?

16:43.504 --> 16:46.673
I'm trying.

16:46.840 --> 16:52.179
You must have some recollection
of a fair-haired boy outside your door?

16:52.346 --> 16:55.933
At the piano?
On the piano?

16:59.436 --> 17:01.522
No, I'm sorry.

17:02.564 --> 17:06.026
Before the memories
come flooding back to you...

17:08.403 --> 17:13.282
I should tell you we had a romance
that didn't have a happy ending.

17:17.579 --> 17:20.123
That's why I'm here.

17:20.833 --> 17:25.878
Our last evening together,
we walked through a summer storm

17:26.046 --> 17:29.716
and I kissed the raindrops
off your nose

17:29.883 --> 17:32.636
and promised we'd always be together.

17:33.679 --> 17:36.265
But I broke that promise.

17:36.431 --> 17:40.936
You helped a shy adolescent
take his first steps to becoming a man

17:41.103 --> 17:45.732
and I repaid you by running off
and leaving you with just memories.

17:45.941 --> 17:49.361
And not many of those, either.

17:50.487 --> 17:54.283
- Can you ever forgive me?
- Oh, you're so sweet!

17:54.449 --> 17:58.579
- Of course I can forgive you.
- Thank you.

17:58.745 --> 18:01.707
It's such a relief
to get that off my chest.

18:01.874 --> 18:06.086
- (Woman) 'Mother? I'm going now!'
- You run along, Clarice!

18:06.253 --> 18:07.796
Clarice?

18:08.630 --> 18:10.591
Excuse me.

18:10.841 --> 18:14.428
Dear, this is Frasier Crane.

18:14.595 --> 18:17.598
Apparently, we were
quite an item once.

18:21.018 --> 18:25.147
Frasier Crane?
What are you doing here?

18:26.273 --> 18:29.151
Obviously,
making an enormous mistake.

18:31.195 --> 18:34.281
Mother, would you get us
some iced tea?

18:35.949 --> 18:38.744
She's getting rid of me,
but I'll be back.

18:43.165 --> 18:45.125
My God!

18:45.375 --> 18:47.753
I can't believe you're here.

18:47.920 --> 18:51.590
- It's got to be 20...
- 25.

18:51.757 --> 18:54.927
25 years!

18:55.761 --> 18:57.846
And look at you!

18:58.013 --> 19:00.682
Look at you! You look incredible.

19:00.849 --> 19:03.852
Well, sure, compared to my mother.

19:04.520 --> 19:05.854
No.

19:07.606 --> 19:09.983
That's not what I mean.

19:10.150 --> 19:11.985
You look...

19:12.277 --> 19:16.156
- stunning.
- Well, thank you.

19:16.323 --> 19:20.619
And you, you've become
a very handsome man.

19:21.954 --> 19:25.707
- And successful, too.
- Thank you.

19:30.254 --> 19:33.298
You're here because of that book,
aren't you?

19:33.465 --> 19:36.802
Yes, and I'd like to apologise
right off.

19:38.846 --> 19:43.267
I told that story in confidence.
It was never meant to be in print.

19:43.433 --> 19:46.854
There's no need to apologise.

19:47.062 --> 19:50.774
That was a lovely time in my life.

19:51.984 --> 19:54.403
It was nice to relive it.

20:01.577 --> 20:05.205
So...are you married?

20:05.914 --> 20:09.668
- Divorced. You?
- I never married.

20:11.378 --> 20:15.007
I came to apologise
about more than just the book.

20:17.426 --> 20:20.888
I never felt quite right
about the way I left things.

20:21.096 --> 20:25.434
I abandoned you.
It was selfish and cowardly.

20:25.601 --> 20:29.813
Oh, Frasier, relax.

20:29.980 --> 20:34.109
I always felt guilty for short-changing
you on your music lessons.

20:38.447 --> 20:40.741
Do you still keep it up?

20:45.287 --> 20:48.415
Oh, the piano? Yes.

20:51.084 --> 20:56.965
I was so nervous about coming here
and now it just feels like old times.

20:58.050 --> 21:00.093
Sit at middle C.

21:01.470 --> 21:04.556
Then...the metronome.

21:06.558 --> 21:08.936
(Metronome ticks)

21:10.687 --> 21:14.483
I, well...
Maybe I should get going.

21:17.277 --> 21:22.366
At the risk of sounding forward,
would you have a coffee with me?

21:22.574 --> 21:25.244
Thanks, but I'll have to say no.

21:25.410 --> 21:28.038
The age difference
is no longer an issue.

21:28.205 --> 21:29.748
(Door knocks)

21:30.415 --> 21:34.253
- Hi, honey. Ready to go?
- I'll be right out.

21:39.967 --> 21:42.177
- Are you and he...?
- Uh-huh.

21:42.344 --> 21:47.891
I wasn't interested in 40-year-old
men then and I guess I'm still not.

21:48.058 --> 21:50.394
It's great to see you again, though.

21:50.561 --> 21:52.229
Bye, Mom!

21:57.359 --> 22:00.320
Good. Now we're alone.

22:04.408 --> 22:08.078
See what I did?
I put a raindrop on my nose!

22:14.459 --> 22:19.923
# Hey baby, I hear the blues are calling
tossed salads and scrambled eggs

22:20.090 --> 22:21.592
# Oh, my!

22:21.758 --> 22:28.599
# And maybe I seem a bit confused
Well, maybe...but I got you pegged!

22:28.765 --> 22:33.896
# But I don't know what to do with those
tossed salads and scrambled eggs

22:34.104 --> 22:37.357
# They're calling again #

22:37.524 --> 22:40.277
Good night, Seattle, we love you!
