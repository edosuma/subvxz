00:15.890 --> 00:17.600
This is the outfit she wore.

00:18.184 --> 00:20.228
This is the dinner she ate.

00:20.311 --> 00:23.440
The point is
that after wanting to do it forever,

00:23.523 --> 00:26.443
Devi had finally had sex, and it was--

00:27.027 --> 00:29.195
Oh hell, they seem awkward.

00:30.071 --> 00:31.573
Well, we did it.

00:32.782 --> 00:33.616
Yep.

00:33.700 --> 00:34.784
We had sex.

00:35.952 --> 00:36.786
Mm-hmm.

00:37.287 --> 00:38.621
You were inside of me.

00:39.414 --> 00:40.582
[smacking lips] I was.

00:41.082 --> 00:43.251
Ben Gross was inside of me.

00:43.960 --> 00:47.130
It's weird that you're talking about me
in the third person while I'm here.

00:47.213 --> 00:48.423
Um, sorry. Sorry.

00:51.301 --> 00:52.427
So…

00:54.179 --> 00:55.555
-So…
-Mmm.

00:56.723 --> 00:59.225
[McEnroe] Ben, say something nice.

00:59.309 --> 01:00.602
Something supportive.

01:00.685 --> 01:01.519
Um…

01:01.603 --> 01:02.687
[McEnroe] Anything.

01:03.772 --> 01:06.399
I-- I guess if there's nothing else,
I should hit the hay.

01:08.026 --> 01:09.152
Can I call you an Uber?

01:09.944 --> 01:10.820
Oh.

01:10.904 --> 01:14.491
No, I'm good. But, yeah, I should bounce.

01:14.574 --> 01:15.825

Ben, to quote the title
of my own bestselling memoir,

01:21.456 --> 01:23.500

01:32.383 --> 01:35.220
[McEnroe] Well, my friends,
welcome to the shit show.

01:35.303 --> 01:37.555
[both] You had sex with Ben Gross?

01:37.639 --> 01:38.765
-Yes.
-How was it?

01:38.848 --> 01:40.141
Okay, I think.

01:40.225 --> 01:41.643
-Did you have an orgasm?
-No.

01:41.726 --> 01:43.019
-Did he?
-I think so.

01:43.103 --> 01:44.896
-How many positions did you do?
-One.

01:44.979 --> 01:47.774
-How many were we supposed to do?
-I think like four to five.

01:47.857 --> 01:49.901
They definitely do four to five
on Euphoria.

01:49.984 --> 01:51.820
Do you think Ben wanted
to have Euphoria sex?

01:51.903 --> 01:53.029
I mean, who doesn't?

01:53.113 --> 01:54.614
[Devi] How was I supposed to know that?

01:54.697 --> 01:56.991
Guys, I think I'm bad at sex.

01:57.075 --> 01:59.327
I had no idea
what to do with my legs or arms.

01:59.410 --> 02:02.330
I was like the inflatable balloon man
at a tire store.

02:02.413 --> 02:04.874
You should have seen
the look on Ben's face afterwards.

02:04.958 --> 02:06.709
He was clearly embarrassed for me.

02:06.793 --> 02:09.420
Well, what's the deal with you two now?
Like, are you together?

02:09.504 --> 02:11.005
Yeah. Do you love him?

02:11.089 --> 02:14.384
Love him? Of course not.
I only love my family and Michelle Obama.

02:14.467 --> 02:15.468
[inhales deeply]

02:15.552 --> 02:17.387
But I do like him.

02:17.929 --> 02:20.056
Like, really, really like him.

02:20.140 --> 02:21.766
Then you need to text him.

Ben was dealing with his stress

02:27.981 --> 02:31.192

with some hardcore leg curls.

Well, I can't take pictures right now,

No, look, I get it.

03:07.604 --> 03:09.189
I know you're a busy celebrity,

03:09.272 --> 03:12.317

that I met you here today, because, um…

it's gonna be okay.

It's just last night,

03:32.295 --> 03:34.756
I had sex with someone
I really care about for the first time,

03:34.839 --> 03:38.009
and it was… really bad.

03:38.092 --> 03:41.387
Whoa, I don't wanna talk
to a random teenager about sex.

03:41.471 --> 03:43.848
That's kinda like
one of the rules I have for myself.

03:43.932 --> 03:46.893
Okay, it's just that after we were done,
she didn't say anything.

03:46.976 --> 03:49.187
Like, it was so clear
that she thought it sucked. She…

03:49.270 --> 03:50.730
She got up and sprinted out.

03:50.813 --> 03:52.774
Damn. That's messed up.

03:52.857 --> 03:56.486
But do you have any friends
or someone you could talk to about this?

03:57.070 --> 03:59.155
No, I don't have any friends.

04:05.453 --> 04:09.249

Oh my God, I'm so sorry.

04:12.126 --> 04:14.003
That text was just so lame.
It was a reflex.

04:14.087 --> 04:16.422
Yeah, babe, you seem a little thirsty.

04:16.506 --> 04:20.677
No "lover," no exclamation points,
no sit-down restaurants.

Thank you. And I like my hair like this.

love is a verb, not just a noun.

I can focus on what's important.

09:29.819 --> 09:30.736
Getting into Princeton

09:30.820 --> 09:32.905
and getting Timothée Chalamet
to follow me on Insta.

09:32.989 --> 09:35.866
And I am so excited to recruit new kids
for the robotics team.

09:35.950 --> 09:38.995
Eric says there's a big crop of nerds
coming from the middle school,

09:39.078 --> 09:40.288
which is huge for us.

09:40.371 --> 09:42.039
Huh. Well, all in all,

09:42.123 --> 09:45.126
I think we've really grown into being
the poised, fearless women

09:45.209 --> 09:46.627
we always dreamed we'd be.

09:47.587 --> 09:49.338
Oh, shit, there's Ben. Hide me.

09:49.422 --> 09:51.382
[school bell ringing]

09:51.966 --> 09:53.175
He's gone.

09:53.259 --> 09:55.761
Dude, you gotta talk to him at some point.

09:55.845 --> 09:57.138
And I will,

09:57.221 --> 10:00.391
at our 20th high school reunion when
I show up with my smoking hot husband.

10:00.975 --> 10:02.977
Whatever actor's playing
the most current Spider-Man.

10:03.060 --> 10:06.063
-[Eleanor and Fabiola] Mmm.
-Ew. Why does it reek of weed?

10:06.147 --> 10:08.566
-[boy 1] Yo, that's stupid, bro.
-[boy 2 chuckles]

10:08.649 --> 10:11.027
Whoa, the Hot Pocket
looks different this year.

10:11.986 --> 10:14.739
[McEnroe] This year, the Hot Pocket
was more like the High Pocket.

10:15.448 --> 10:18.618
Last year, the popular boys
were harmless jocks.

10:18.701 --> 10:20.953
Now it was burnouts and bad boys,

10:21.037 --> 10:24.332
and the baddest of them all
was Ethan Morales.

10:24.415 --> 10:26.751
He was known
for holding court in the parking lot

10:27.335 --> 10:30.254
where he did property-damaging
skateboard tricks

10:30.338 --> 10:32.131
and occasionally day drank.

10:32.214 --> 10:35.009
Holy shit, did Ethan get smoking hot
over the summer?

10:35.092 --> 10:36.719
He grew like two feet.

10:36.802 --> 10:41.307
Yeah. When did his torso get so claw-able?

10:41.390 --> 10:43.601
What's up? Whose torso is claw-able?

10:43.684 --> 10:46.270
Uh, mine. Because I have a rash.

10:46.354 --> 10:48.606
I'm sorry, babe, that sounds really gross.

10:48.689 --> 10:50.691
What you up to?
Wanna go make out by the bleachers?

10:50.775 --> 10:53.152
Maybe not second base.
'Cause I don't wanna catch your rash.

10:53.235 --> 10:55.154
I'd love to, but I'm so busy.

10:55.237 --> 10:57.865
I have my meeting with Ms. Warner,
the college counselor,

10:57.948 --> 10:59.950
and we start rehearsals
for the fall musical,

11:00.034 --> 11:01.661
a stage adaptation of Dune.

11:01.744 --> 11:04.121
-What's your schedule like?
-Uh…

11:04.205 --> 11:06.082
Yeah, I'm super busy too,

11:06.582 --> 11:07.458
with classes.

11:07.541 --> 11:10.127
Oh, what are you taking?
We're all in BC Calc and AP Lit.

11:10.211 --> 11:13.964
Oh, I wanted to take those classes,
but they just sounded too easy for me,

11:14.048 --> 11:16.092
so I'm in BP Frigonometry.

11:16.175 --> 11:17.218
What?

11:17.301 --> 11:20.096
I gotta jet. But I'll see you
fellow eggheads in study hall later.

11:20.179 --> 11:21.806
[pleasant music playing]

11:21.889 --> 11:22.973
[school bell ringing]

11:24.475 --> 11:27.770
[McEnroe] And there she was,
Dr. Mary Jean Keyes,

11:27.853 --> 11:29.689
a legend at Sherman Oaks High

11:29.772 --> 11:33.150
for writing the most incredible
college recommendations.

11:33.776 --> 11:36.404
But due to Dr. Keyes's
crippling arthritis,

11:36.487 --> 11:39.031
she only wrote two recommendations a year.

11:39.115 --> 11:41.992
She was also extremely conservative,

11:42.076 --> 11:45.579
and believed that teenagers should adhere
to the rules of propriety

11:45.663 --> 11:47.331
from the Victorian era.

11:48.249 --> 11:49.208
Outrageous.

11:50.167 --> 11:53.087
[McEnroe] Devi was determined
to grab one of those recs,

11:53.170 --> 11:56.382
so she walked her knee-length kilt
right over to that desk.

11:56.966 --> 11:58.217
Good morning, Dr. Keyes.

11:58.300 --> 12:01.762
I just wanted to say
how excited I am for AP Lit this year.

12:01.846 --> 12:04.849
Well, I'll warn you,
we don't use tablets in my class.

12:04.932 --> 12:08.018
We read the old-fashioned way
from dusty books that make you sneeze.

12:08.102 --> 12:09.937
I'd take a Claritin if I were you.

12:10.020 --> 12:11.814
Oh, I'm looking forward to it.

12:12.481 --> 12:16.861
This might be old-fashioned of me,
but I just wanted to give you these.

12:19.029 --> 12:21.532
[Dr. Keyes] Harry & David pears?
How wonderful.

12:22.241 --> 12:25.286
Devi, this really is an elegant gift.

12:25.369 --> 12:29.749
And if I may, I am so pleased
to see a young girl this day and age

12:29.832 --> 12:32.918
not dressed like a pinup poster
in a prison cell.

12:33.002 --> 12:33.878
Of course.

12:33.961 --> 12:35.921
The only person
that needs to see my midriff

12:36.005 --> 12:38.257
is my future husband
or my gastroenterologist.

12:38.340 --> 12:39.550
[both laugh]

12:39.633 --> 12:40.593
[sighs]

12:40.676 --> 12:44.638
I do hope that you would consider me
for one of your legendary recommendations.

12:44.722 --> 12:46.599
Oh, that remains to be seen,

12:46.682 --> 12:50.436
but I can tell already
you're on the right track.

12:50.519 --> 12:52.605
[upbeat music playing]

12:52.688 --> 12:54.857
[McEnroe] After the triumph
with Dr. Keyes,

12:54.940 --> 12:56.984
Devi felt like she was on a roll,

12:57.067 --> 13:00.446
and so she decided to do
the mature thing and talk to Ben.

13:00.529 --> 13:04.992
Sometimes, when things don't go your way,
you can still be graceful and learn.

13:05.075 --> 13:07.995
Like when I lost to Björn Borg
at Wimbledon in 1980.

13:08.078 --> 13:10.372
It wasn't how I wanted it to work out.

13:10.456 --> 13:12.833
But what can I say? I still love the guy.

13:13.334 --> 13:14.919
And that's how Devi felt.

13:15.002 --> 13:16.962
She and Ben would get past…

13:17.046 --> 13:18.464
-…this.
-[music ends]

13:19.048 --> 13:20.841
What the actual F?

13:20.925 --> 13:22.259
Ben was with Margot?

13:22.885 --> 13:25.638
This is not like me and Björn Borg at all.

13:25.721 --> 13:27.181
-The balls on this guy.
-[Devi scoffs]

13:27.264 --> 13:28.641
-[school bell ringing]
-Devi, wait.

13:29.183 --> 13:30.893
What the hell? You're with Margot?

13:30.976 --> 13:32.269
I… [sighs]

13:32.353 --> 13:33.521
Yes, I am.

13:33.604 --> 13:35.940
[sighs] I cannot believe you.

13:36.023 --> 13:39.693
You ignored me all summer,
after you took my virginity.

13:39.777 --> 13:42.905
And now you come to school flaunting
your new girlfriend right in my face?

13:42.988 --> 13:44.490
I assumed it was a one-time thing,

13:44.573 --> 13:47.326
especially because of the way
you bolted out of my room right afterward.

13:47.409 --> 13:48.369
I didn't bolt.

13:48.452 --> 13:50.746
Yes, you did, and you did finger guns.

13:50.830 --> 13:53.082
Yeah, only after you said
you'd call me an Uber?

13:53.165 --> 13:56.252
I said that because you weren't saying
anything and you looked uncomfortable.

13:56.335 --> 13:57.837
Whatever. I texted you.

13:57.920 --> 14:01.590
But apparently, one pretty mediocre bang
was all you wanted from me

14:01.674 --> 14:03.384
before you moved on to the next warm body.

14:03.467 --> 14:04.593
What'd you just call me?

14:04.677 --> 14:07.263
[exhales] I'm sorry. We're in the middle
of a private conversation.

14:07.346 --> 14:10.683
It doesn't sound private.
You're screaming at my boyfriend.

14:11.308 --> 14:14.979
[McEnroe] Hearing the word "boyfriend,"
and how official it made them sound

14:15.062 --> 14:17.439
was like a dagger in Devi's heart.

14:17.523 --> 14:20.985
And when Devi was hurt,
she did not always make smart choices.

14:21.569 --> 14:24.488
Yeah, you should know that Ben and I
had sex before you guys got together,

14:24.572 --> 14:26.073
so you might wanna dump his ass.

14:26.657 --> 14:29.994
Actually, he did tell me that,
and I'm not sure why I should care.

14:30.077 --> 14:33.247
I… I think this is escalating
in an unnecessarily public way.

14:33.330 --> 14:36.709
Also, I think it's pretty clear which
warm body he wanted, and it wasn't yours.

14:36.792 --> 14:39.628
-[students groan]
-Great. Yeah, couldn't be happier for you.

14:39.712 --> 14:43.340
You know what? I hope you have a nice life
riding Ben Gross's circumcised dick.

14:43.424 --> 14:47.595
Yeah, that's right, people,
I've seen it up close and personal.

14:47.678 --> 14:48.679
[Dr. Keyes groaning]

14:49.388 --> 14:50.556
[students gasp]

14:50.639 --> 14:52.892
Oh my God! Dr. Keyes!

14:53.475 --> 14:56.020
Dude, Devi just killed that old lady.

14:56.604 --> 14:58.731
Great. Are you happy now?
Look what you did.

14:58.814 --> 15:00.274
Me? I should kick your ass!

15:01.317 --> 15:04.528
Miss Vishwakumar, Miss Ramos,
to my office now.

15:04.612 --> 15:06.071
[Dr. Keyes groaning]

15:06.155 --> 15:08.574
[Principal Grubbs]
And someone get the nurse for Dr. Keyes.

15:09.283 --> 15:11.327
Just so I'm completely clear on this,

15:11.410 --> 15:14.872
you two are threatening
to beat each other up over Ben Gross?

15:14.955 --> 15:16.081
-Yes.
-That's right.

15:17.750 --> 15:19.710
Yeah, there's only one Ben Gross
in this school.

15:19.793 --> 15:24.131
Okay, look, Sherman Oaks High
has a zero-tolerance policy

15:24.214 --> 15:26.091
against violence or threats of violence.

15:26.175 --> 15:28.928
Margot, you need to apologize
to Devi immediately.

15:29.011 --> 15:31.597
Can't I just get detention,
or, like, clean some toilets?

15:31.680 --> 15:33.140
I'll literally do anything else.

15:33.223 --> 15:35.392
Look, I know how annoying Devi can be.

15:35.476 --> 15:38.270
Lord knows I've had to bite my tongue
over the years.

15:38.354 --> 15:40.439
-Uh-- What?
-Just say you're sorry.

15:41.023 --> 15:42.107
Fine. [sighs]

15:42.691 --> 15:44.318
Even though you acted like a skank,

15:44.401 --> 15:46.695
it was not cool
to threaten to kick your ass.

15:47.196 --> 15:48.489
Which I could've done easily.

15:48.572 --> 15:50.324
Okay, wonderful. You're dismissed.

15:50.407 --> 15:52.534
Whoa, that's it? That was mostly insults.

15:52.618 --> 15:53.577
Devi, go to class.

15:53.661 --> 15:54.912
[upbeat music playing]

15:54.995 --> 15:56.330
[indistinct chatter]

15:57.456 --> 15:59.208
Cool brochures. What are they for?

15:59.291 --> 16:00.751
One of those disciplinary bootcamps

16:00.834 --> 16:03.587
that throws you in a van
in the middle of the night? Been there.

16:03.671 --> 16:05.756
No, silly, Ms. Warner gave them to me.

16:05.839 --> 16:08.884
They're info
on all the best acting conservatories.

16:08.968 --> 16:12.262
Whoa, El, this one's from the Royal
Academy of Dramatic Art in London.

16:12.346 --> 16:15.099
[gasps] You could be one of those
topless ladies on Bridgerton.

16:15.182 --> 16:18.602
[laughs] Damn, Trent, looks like
she's gonna wanna upgrade soon.

16:18.686 --> 16:20.562
[school bell ringing]

16:20.646 --> 16:21.814
No, I won't. [chuckles]

16:21.897 --> 16:24.566
If I move to London,
and you and I are still together,

16:24.650 --> 16:25.734
you can come with me.

16:25.818 --> 16:28.070
What do you mean if we're still together?

16:28.153 --> 16:29.279
You know what I mean.

16:29.363 --> 16:32.157
That's, like, a year away.
Who knows what could happen?

16:32.241 --> 16:33.909
[upbeat music playing]

16:35.744 --> 16:37.871
Robotics is the future.

16:37.955 --> 16:40.457
It's where coding meets innovation,
and it's fun.

16:40.541 --> 16:45.337
We are so proud of the friendships
that we've made, both human and droid.

16:45.921 --> 16:48.757
Robotics team is #SquadGoals.

16:48.841 --> 16:51.010
-[students] Oh.
-This is such a great turnout.

16:51.093 --> 16:52.594
What a diverse group of…

16:52.678 --> 16:53.804
[indistinct chatter]

16:53.887 --> 16:55.014
…boys.

16:55.723 --> 16:56.557
All boys.

16:56.640 --> 16:59.810
Let's cut to the chase.
We are the rock stars of the school.

16:59.893 --> 17:01.520
We bring machines to life.

17:01.603 --> 17:03.731
Robotics is not for the weak of heart.

17:03.814 --> 17:06.734
-What if we have medically weak hearts?
-Oh, I was speaking figuratively.

17:06.817 --> 17:08.235
Many of us have heart issues.

17:08.318 --> 17:12.156
So please enjoy the refreshments
and learning about our awesomeness.

17:13.407 --> 17:17.036
Eric, everyone who showed up is a guy.
Isn't that kinda weird?

17:17.119 --> 17:20.664
[scoffs] Well, that's probably because
statistically men are more--

17:20.748 --> 17:23.917
Stop. I'm already offended by however
you're going to finish that sentence.

17:24.001 --> 17:27.004
Torres, guys just tend to like this stuff
more than girls.

17:27.087 --> 17:30.466
That's why it's so cool you're
the only girl on the team. You're special.

17:30.549 --> 17:34.762
[McEnroe] But Fabiola didn't feel special,
she felt weird.

17:35.262 --> 17:37.139
Meanwhile, in Studio City,

17:37.222 --> 17:41.143
Devi's therapist, Dr. Ryan,
had just started her long-awaited break,

17:41.226 --> 17:43.395
enjoying the two things she liked most,

17:43.479 --> 17:46.690
sweet potato fries
and the Anthropologie catalog.

17:46.774 --> 17:49.902
Ooh, this sconce is nice.

17:51.528 --> 17:53.781
Dr. Ryan, stop everything. I need you.

17:53.864 --> 17:56.158
Um, we don't have a session
for another hour,

17:56.241 --> 17:57.785
and I'm right in the middle of my lunch.

17:57.868 --> 17:59.912
It… It couldn't wait, Doc.
Ben's dating a bitch.

18:01.163 --> 18:03.332
O-- Okay, let's get into it.

18:03.415 --> 18:06.168
Why do you care that Ben is dating a…

18:07.044 --> 18:08.128
girl you don't like?

18:08.212 --> 18:10.964
Because Margot's horrible,
and he deserves so much better.

18:11.048 --> 18:13.425
-So I called her out in front of everyone.
-[sighs]

18:13.509 --> 18:16.720
Devi, you know it's okay
if you still have feelings for Ben.

18:16.804 --> 18:18.639
What? That's what you got from this?

18:18.722 --> 18:23.477
I mean, what you two shared
was something incredibly intimate, Devi,

18:23.560 --> 18:26.021
and then he abandoned you.

18:26.105 --> 18:27.523
Uh-- He didn't--

18:29.024 --> 18:31.944
-I don't-- I don't have feelings for him.
-You don't?

18:32.528 --> 18:36.406
[sighs] It's just--
I know it's so obvious and pathetic

18:36.490 --> 18:40.035
to be that teen girl that has sex
with a guy once and gets attached.

18:40.119 --> 18:43.497
You know, like, "Get over it.
He doesn't care about you."

18:44.331 --> 18:46.458
But I'm just so--

18:46.542 --> 18:47.626
Hurt?

18:48.585 --> 18:49.503
Yes.

18:50.295 --> 18:51.797
Oh, baby.

18:52.881 --> 18:54.174
What is wrong with me?

18:54.258 --> 18:57.553
What would make Ben sleep with me
and decide not to be with me?

18:57.636 --> 19:00.430
Hey, hey, there is nothing wrong with you.

19:00.514 --> 19:04.935
When I look at you,
I see a smart, beautiful young lady.

19:05.018 --> 19:09.857
And I don't mean that feminist woo-woo
"every woman is beautiful" kind of thing.

19:09.940 --> 19:11.692
I mean real beauty.

19:12.776 --> 19:14.695
You're extraordinary, Devi.

-I am?
-You am.

Thanks, Doc.

Listen, it is okay to be mad at Ben.

19:27.082 --> 19:29.001
What he did to you was unkind.

19:29.084 --> 19:33.964
But what you're not allowed to do
is lash out at this new girlfriend. Uh-uh.

19:34.047 --> 19:37.050
Okay? Women always wanna take
something out on another woman

19:37.134 --> 19:39.511
when most of the time
it's the man's fault.

19:39.595 --> 19:41.722
Yeah, 'cause it's easier
to be mad at women

19:41.805 --> 19:43.473
'cause we know what sneaks we are.

19:43.557 --> 19:47.394

Mm-hmm.

20:11.001 --> 20:11.919
Hmm.

20:12.002 --> 20:16.006
Now that you're on the path, you think
you can be a grownup about this girl?

20:16.089 --> 20:16.924
I do.
