05:37.530 --> 05:38.880

06:00.400 --> 06:04.020
It appears we're in the world of <i>Elder Tale</i>.

06:10.200 --> 06:13.280
Wasn't today the day they planned 
to add the new expansion?

06:13.280 --> 06:15.970
Yeah, The Novasphere Pioneers.

06:16.370 --> 06:19.740
Up until the second they executed the 
update, I can remember everything.

06:20.530 --> 06:23.090
And the next thing I knew, I was here.

06:23.490 --> 06:24.440
Same with me.

06:26.480 --> 06:28.950
This is definitely Akihabara.

06:29.700 --> 06:32.310

06:32.730 --> 06:33.530
But...

06:34.190 --> 06:36.260
The sky stretches so much further.

06:36.780 --> 06:37.610
Yeah.

06:40.290 --> 06:41.810
And it feels like I'm really touching it.

06:42.420 --> 06:43.810
Which means...

06:45.300 --> 06:47.090
I guess this isn't a dream.

06:47.440 --> 06:49.490
Then we're in the game, huh?

06:49.490 --> 06:51.690
I thought that only happened in fantasy novels.

06:52.630 --> 06:55.600
You think we can get home?

06:56.400 --> 06:57.350
I don't know.

06:58.040 --> 07:01.200
How did we get here, in the first place?

07:01.200 --> 07:02.470
Yeah.

07:03.190 --> 07:06.140
I know... We may not be 
able to return quickly.

07:07.620 --> 07:08.630
Which means...

07:11.150 --> 07:13.830
We should be ready.

07:14.240 --> 07:15.510

07:16.200 --> 07:17.740

07:17.740 --> 07:20.620

07:21.000 --> 07:21.880
That's true.

07:22.210 --> 07:25.510
Good to see you as calm 
and analytical as ever.

07:25.930 --> 07:28.580
I'm counting on you, Strategist.

07:29.170 --> 07:32.390
Calm isn't the word I'd choose.

07:33.190 --> 07:35.310
I know this isn't what you expected,

07:35.750 --> 07:38.070
but welcome back to <i>Elder Tale</i>, Naotsugu.

07:38.070 --> 07:38.890

07:47.070 --> 07:49.530
<i>The buildings and roads 
were just as I remembered.</i>

07:50.200 --> 07:52.280
<i>In other words, just like the game.</i>

08:01.120 --> 08:02.630

08:05.710 --> 08:08.310

08:08.310 --> 08:08.960
No,

08:09.480 --> 08:10.700

08:11.440 --> 08:12.370

08:13.110 --> 08:15.920

08:15.920 --> 08:17.380
No way!

08:17.380 --> 08:18.390
You go check it out!

08:18.390 --> 08:19.650

08:21.510 --> 08:24.270
Help me! Someone, help me!

08:27.390 --> 08:29.130
If you're back in the game,

08:29.130 --> 08:30.630
your work must have calmed down.

08:30.630 --> 08:31.510
Yeah.

08:31.510 --> 08:34.810
What really sucks is there 
aren't any cute girls at work.

08:35.220 --> 08:36.910
Who cares?

08:37.210 --> 08:38.650
What was that?

08:38.650 --> 08:40.030
You're just a closet pervert!

08:40.030 --> 08:41.670
I'm not a closet anything!

08:42.750 --> 08:45.210
There are two types of men in this world.

08:45.460 --> 08:47.930
Open perverts who admit it,

08:47.930 --> 08:50.120
and closet perverts who won't.

08:50.120 --> 08:51.760
I am the former!

08:51.760 --> 08:54.560
And I love panties!

08:56.700 --> 08:58.350
You are the latter.

08:58.880 --> 09:00.050
Yeah, yeah.

09:00.050 --> 09:01.930
And I know you love them, too!

09:03.560 --> 09:04.650
What's wrong?

09:06.120 --> 09:08.360
How tall are you, Naotsugu?

09:08.360 --> 09:09.280
In real life.

09:09.660 --> 09:11.240
183 cm,

09:11.240 --> 09:13.330
just like in <i>Elder Tale</i>.

09:14.220 --> 09:17.190
My character is taller than I really am.

09:17.190 --> 09:20.320
So this body doesn't feel quite right...

09:21.740 --> 09:23.500
That's what you get for showing off.

09:23.500 --> 09:24.620
Anyway...

09:24.620 --> 09:29.250
To some degree, your game character 
reflects your real self.

09:31.510 --> 09:33.010
What are you doing?

09:33.370 --> 09:34.570
That's dangerous!

09:36.090 --> 09:36.720
You're...

Akatsuki!

09:39.400 --> 09:41.350

09:41.660 --> 09:44.110
We were in a party together.

09:44.580 --> 09:48.750
Not much of a talker, but a good assassin.

09:52.800 --> 09:55.320
So you're also here, Akatsuki.

09:55.820 --> 09:58.190
I'm Naotsugu, a guardian.

09:58.190 --> 10:01.170
Whether you're an open 
pervert or not, let's get along.

10:02.380 --> 10:03.960
You say that to someone you just met?

10:03.960 --> 10:05.040
Yup!

10:05.040 --> 10:07.630
Shiroe, I've been looking for you.

10:08.870 --> 10:10.160
I want you to sell me a potion...

10:10.920 --> 10:14.420
An appearance-changing potion.

10:14.710 --> 10:16.190
That voice...

10:16.190 --> 10:19.770
Akatsuki, you're a girl?

10:21.270 --> 10:23.960
No wonder you never spoke much.

10:28.660 --> 10:31.190
Appearance-changing potions...

10:31.190 --> 10:34.200
Those are rare. 
They only distributed them once.

10:34.660 --> 10:37.150
I remembered Shiroe had one.

10:38.140 --> 10:39.450
L-Let me go...

10:40.070 --> 10:43.810
I thought you wouldn't use voice chat 
because you were playing as an assassin.

10:46.800 --> 10:47.790
Are you okay?

10:59.440 --> 11:00.800
It's all right now.

11:05.020 --> 11:06.450
She's hot!

11:06.450 --> 11:07.320
The real deal!

11:06.910 --> 11:11.860

11:10.980 --> 11:11.860
I really appreciate it.

11:11.860 --> 11:14.550
I-It's fine...

11:20.240 --> 11:22.020
I retract my earlier statement.

11:23.350 --> 11:27.210
You can't be either an open pervert 
or a closet one, because...

11:28.180 --> 11:30.040
You aren't a man!

11:31.080 --> 11:34.630
Shiroe, is there something wrong with him?

11:34.630 --> 11:36.880
There are many things wrong with him.

11:36.880 --> 11:38.090
Why is that?

11:38.640 --> 11:40.940
In any case, he's messed up.

11:41.440 --> 11:42.960
So, Akatsuki,

11:42.960 --> 11:46.180
did you adjust your character 
to be closer to your real size?

11:46.180 --> 11:46.970
Yes.

11:47.620 --> 11:50.280
You should have done that in the first place.

11:50.280 --> 11:54.040
Games are fun because you can do things 
you couldn't in real life, right?

11:54.440 --> 11:57.940
But once I was stuck here, 
it was very inconvenient.

11:58.600 --> 11:59.570
Inconvenient?

12:00.470 --> 12:02.200
Ah! You mean like the bathroom!

12:04.630 --> 12:08.630
Shiroe, is it all right if I knee 
this strange man in the face?

12:08.630 --> 12:10.820
Ask <i>before</i> you do it, shrimp!

12:10.820 --> 12:12.170
Don't call me a shrimp!

12:13.440 --> 12:15.540
Anyway, how much do I owe you?

12:16.630 --> 12:18.920
Oh, don't worry about it.

12:18.920 --> 12:20.050
I can't do that.

12:20.780 --> 12:23.050
I don't want anyone saying 
I wouldn't repay a favor.

12:23.390 --> 12:25.470
But...

12:25.470 --> 12:28.100
If it's that big a deal, you can...

12:31.490 --> 12:35.480
Shiroe, is it all right if I knee 
this strange man in the face?

12:35.480 --> 12:37.960
I said to ask <i>before</i> you do it!

12:37.960 --> 12:40.310
And I didn't even finish!

12:40.310 --> 12:42.420
You were about to say something bad.

12:42.420 --> 12:43.820
I was, but...

12:45.640 --> 12:49.570
Anyhow, why don't you stay with us for a while?

12:51.070 --> 12:53.120
Strategist! Explain.

12:53.400 --> 12:56.500
<i>That's true... We can't leave her by herself.</i>

12:57.360 --> 12:58.580
Akatsuki...

12:58.580 --> 13:00.900
Didn't you refuse to join a guild?

13:00.900 --> 13:03.380
Assassins are lone wolves.

13:04.330 --> 13:06.470
We aren't in one, either.

13:07.240 --> 13:11.910
But right now, I think it's better to 
stay in a group than go alone.

13:12.390 --> 13:14.940
Are you all right with that, Shiroe?

13:15.860 --> 13:17.860
We'd be happy to have you.

13:19.190 --> 13:20.420
I see...

13:21.520 --> 13:25.360
Then, as a ninja, I shall revere you as my lord.

13:25.360 --> 13:27.780
Ninja? Lord?

13:27.780 --> 13:29.370
Wasn't she an assassin?

13:29.840 --> 13:34.160
You have saved me from the dire fate 
of being transformed into a man.

13:34.160 --> 13:37.130
Thus, I must work to repay you.

13:37.700 --> 13:39.850
That is what requiting a debt means.

13:39.850 --> 13:44.440
From now on, as your ninja, I shall protect you.

13:46.020 --> 13:49.380
Well, um... Thanks.

13:51.220 --> 13:53.300
Then we're a team!

14:01.470 --> 14:04.620
Aren't more People of the 
Land around than before?

14:05.150 --> 14:06.150
<b>Albel/ People of the Land</b>

<i>call themselves People of the Land.</i>

14:13.920 --> 14:18.950
<i>And we players are called adventurers.</i>

14:19.820 --> 14:22.130
Want to buy something, guys?

14:22.130 --> 14:23.730
You mean we can eat these?

14:26.220 --> 14:27.930
No time to waste thinking about it!

14:28.380 --> 14:30.300
I'll take rice dumplings and green tea.

14:30.300 --> 14:31.420
Sure thing.

14:35.230 --> 14:36.490
What is this?

14:37.080 --> 14:39.440
They all taste the same.

14:39.740 --> 14:41.200
This...

14:41.620 --> 14:45.440
It feels like a soggy cracker, without salt.

14:45.660 --> 14:48.400
And all the drinks taste like water.

14:50.340 --> 14:51.610
What's up?

14:51.530 --> 14:53.740
<b>Incoming Call</b>

14:51.610 --> 14:52.840
Someone's calling me.

14:53.910 --> 14:54.820
<b>Marielle

14:58.870 --> 15:02.250
Yeah, she leads the guild known 
as the Crescent Moon Alliance.

15:02.880 --> 15:07.080
It's weird how the guild building 
is nothing but doors, though.

15:07.080 --> 15:10.390
Each Guild Hall is its own zone.

15:10.390 --> 15:13.100
Only the really weird stuff is still like a game.

15:28.840 --> 15:31.020

15:31.020 --> 15:33.690
Eat something... Not that it has any flavor!

15:33.690 --> 15:35.700

Do you have a girlfriend now, Shiro?

15:42.500 --> 15:43.900
No!

15:44.130 --> 15:45.880
You're so adorable!

15:45.880 --> 15:47.410
Want a lollipop?

15:47.710 --> 15:51.290
Shiro, where were you hiding this hot chick?

15:51.290 --> 15:52.390
I haven't been hiding her.

15:52.870 --> 15:54.220
Who's this?

15:54.560 --> 15:55.580
Naotsugu!

15:55.580 --> 15:56.410
Nice to meet you!

15:57.580 --> 15:59.930
Naotsugu, huh?

15:59.930 --> 16:01.280

16:02.010 --> 16:03.410
You're pretty buff!

16:03.410 --> 16:05.000
You play sports?

16:05.000 --> 16:06.560
No, um...

16:06.990 --> 16:08.650
I mean, this is armor...

16:08.970 --> 16:10.670
What is her problem?

16:10.670 --> 16:11.970
She's scaring me.

16:11.970 --> 16:14.020
Marie, stop it.

16:14.020 --> 16:15.570
Another one!

16:17.030 --> 16:18.320

Henrietta!

16:20.050 --> 16:21.630
Oh, dear...

16:21.630 --> 16:24.790
I apologize for summoning you here, Shiroe.

16:25.680 --> 16:29.110
Given what's happening, I'd like 
to exchange information...

16:33.320 --> 16:34.590
She's so cute!

16:37.280 --> 16:39.990
There they go again...

16:41.040 --> 16:42.020
Um...

16:42.020 --> 16:43.940
Save me!

16:42.520 --> 16:45.120
Do you want to share information?

16:48.900 --> 16:51.690
Then what about the Crescent 
Moon Alliance members?

16:52.060 --> 16:54.810
Including myself, nineteen are online.

16:54.810 --> 16:57.530
Eighteen are in Akihabara.

16:57.960 --> 17:00.400
Eighteen of nineteen?

17:01.390 --> 17:06.210
I'm told that, along with Akihabara, the other 
four major cities on the Japanese server,

17:06.210 --> 17:09.630
Shibuya, Minami, Susukino, and Nakasu 
are all in the same shape.

17:10.500 --> 17:14.630
And the inter-city transport gates are offline.

17:15.710 --> 17:19.140
In other words, teleporting elsewhere is impossible.

17:19.550 --> 17:26.340
The Akihabara adventurers are all meeting 
with their guilds, just like we are.

17:27.140 --> 17:31.530
Some guilds are also looking to recruit.

17:33.040 --> 17:37.570
At a time like this, the more people 
on your side, the better.

17:37.890 --> 17:40.060
But even if this isn't our world,

17:40.060 --> 17:42.200
we're all very familiar with <i>Elder Tale</i>.

17:42.590 --> 17:44.000
Not necessarily.

17:45.370 --> 17:47.750
You remember the new expansion, right?

17:48.630 --> 17:50.230
The Novasphere Pioneers.

17:52.090 --> 17:52.980
I get it.

17:53.580 --> 17:55.820
If they've added that new expansion,

17:55.820 --> 18:00.720
then monsters, items, and quests 
may all be different.

18:01.010 --> 18:05.870
This world may not be the <i>Elder Tale</i> we know.

18:08.760 --> 18:11.360
H-Hey, Shiro...

18:14.730 --> 18:20.280
I know you aren't a big fan of guilds.

18:23.870 --> 18:25.030
But...

18:25.750 --> 18:27.520
Would you like to join ours?

18:27.520 --> 18:28.670
Marie?

18:29.000 --> 18:32.050
Debauchery Tea Party is gone, right?

18:32.690 --> 18:34.020
And right now...

18:34.020 --> 18:35.120
I'm sorry, Marie.

18:36.180 --> 18:38.720
But I can't yet.

18:43.930 --> 18:45.570
That's a great guild master.

18:46.290 --> 18:50.050
It's all she can do to stay under control, 
but she's still acting so friendly.

18:50.690 --> 18:57.090
Wasn't Debauchery Tea Party a 
legendary guild that disbanded?

18:57.090 --> 18:58.360
No, no...

18:58.360 --> 19:01.020
The Tea Party wasn't a guild.

19:02.020 --> 19:04.250
It was a small group that 
never formed a guild,

19:04.250 --> 19:08.900
but managed to complete several 
large-scale battles called raids.

19:09.390 --> 19:12.960
And Shiroe was their strategist.

19:13.500 --> 19:15.660
How long are we going to be stuck here?

19:15.660 --> 19:17.970
How long will they just sit around there?

19:19.620 --> 19:21.730
Die and you can escape.

19:22.220 --> 19:25.140
In stories like this, that's pretty common.

19:25.140 --> 19:27.980
And sometimes, if you die in 
the game, you die in real life.

19:28.640 --> 19:31.560
When it was just a game, 
you'd revive at the Cathedral.

19:32.100 --> 19:34.190
But we can't very well experiment.

19:36.440 --> 19:39.360
But even if you do revive, 
what about your penalty?

19:40.130 --> 19:41.880
What's wrong, my lord?

19:44.060 --> 19:45.370
Let's try it.

19:49.880 --> 19:51.460
The Archive Tower Forests?

19:52.160 --> 19:54.030
We're level 90.

19:54.030 --> 19:55.420
That's the level cap.

19:56.050 --> 19:58.930
Normally, low-level monsters 
would just ignore us.

19:58.930 --> 20:01.930
But in this area, the monsters will aggro on sight.

20:02.580 --> 20:05.760
So it's the perfect place to try it, my lord.

20:06.470 --> 20:10.170
Oh! You can't use your 
mini-map in the outside zones.

20:11.180 --> 20:12.450
Briar Weasels.

20:12.450 --> 20:14.640
Level 28...

20:12.690 --> 20:14.690
<b>Briar Weasel

20:16.040 --> 20:17.770

W-Wait...

20:20.390 --> 20:21.270
Naotsugu...

20:21.270 --> 20:23.700
It's hard to enter commands while 
monsters are running at you!

20:25.070 --> 20:27.640
<i>There's a difference between 
"using" and "mastering"...</i>

20:28.330 --> 20:29.950
Get into formation, as discussed!

20:32.550 --> 20:34.580
<i>It doesn't hurt as much as I expected.</i>

20:35.090 --> 20:37.750
<i>But unlike when you play the game,</i>

20:37.750 --> 20:39.710
<i>trying to fight monsters in front,</i>

20:39.710 --> 20:43.740
<i>while keeping an eye on your 
party and overall situation...</i>

20:44.680 --> 20:47.720
This won't be easy.

20:50.380 --> 20:52.470
<i>To survive in this world, we must</i>

20:52.470 --> 20:55.770
<i>hurry and learn its rules and how to fight.</i>

20:57.320 --> 20:59.280
<i>But what do we do?</i>

21:03.410 --> 21:04.700
Akatsuki?

21:05.460 --> 21:06.820
How did you do that?

21:07.160 --> 21:09.200
I don't know...

21:09.690 --> 21:11.220
My body just moved on its own.

21:14.440 --> 21:15.570
Naotsugu!

21:15.570 --> 21:16.770
Don't use your commands.

21:16.770 --> 21:18.650
Try to use your body to feel the motion!

21:19.680 --> 21:20.800
What are you talking about?

21:21.440 --> 21:22.730
Just do it!

21:22.730 --> 21:24.800
I don't get it, but fine...

21:25.730 --> 21:27.180

<i>And several hundred thousand worldwide...</i>

22:10.680 --> 22:11.810

Over here!

22:32.650 --> 22:33.710

24:05.550 --> 24:08.000
One day, we found ourselves 
trapped in another world.

24:08.000 --> 24:10.570
There, we fought and hurt one another.

24:10.570 --> 24:13.510
But it was only a game, 
to keep our minds off the fact

24:13.510 --> 24:16.050
that we weren't even allowed to die.
