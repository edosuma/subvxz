00:00.078 --> 00:01.859
- Thank you.
- Thank you, have a great day.

00:08.729 --> 00:10.003
Move.

00:13.961 --> 00:16.780
Eyes down and hands
where we can see 'em!

00:17.738 --> 00:19.894
Hey! You don't wanna
do that, kid.

00:19.982 --> 00:22.316
<i>Men speaking Russian...</i>

00:22.418 --> 00:23.669
Let's go.
Bring them over here.

00:23.756 --> 00:24.816
Come on.
Go, go, move!

00:24.927 --> 00:28.893
It's very simple, people.
You look up, you get shot.

00:29.439 --> 00:30.532
Give me your keys.

00:30.620 --> 00:33.591
Whatever you want.
Please, just don't hurt anyone.

00:33.752 --> 00:35.917
No one's getting hurt unless
someone trips an alarm.

00:36.058 --> 00:38.318
If that happens, I will shoot
every last one of you.

00:38.406 --> 00:39.287
- Are we clear?
- Yes.

00:39.375 --> 00:40.505
- Are we clear?
- Yes!

00:40.593 --> 00:41.818
On the ground.

God.
Come on, come on.

01:47.995 --> 01:50.402
- Here, some coffee.
- Oh, thank you.

01:50.497 --> 01:51.790
Welcome.

01:52.884 --> 01:54.257
Hey, you.

01:54.418 --> 01:55.499
Hey.

01:55.641 --> 01:58.670
Hey, here she is.

01:59.883 --> 02:02.264
Careful, she's still
in the healing phase.

02:02.352 --> 02:04.439
- I'm fine. I'm fine.
- Okay.

02:04.527 --> 02:05.779
- Hey.
- How are you?

02:05.867 --> 02:07.332
- I'm good. Yes,
- You sure?

02:07.420 --> 02:08.520
I'm sure.

02:08.609 --> 02:09.669
Hi, I'm Emily.

02:09.758 --> 02:11.147
Heard a lot of great stuff
about you.

02:11.234 --> 02:13.483
She's working with me till
you get back out in the field.

02:13.834 --> 02:16.513
- Oh, great.
- Welcome aboard.

02:16.601 --> 02:17.619
Thanks.

02:17.715 --> 02:19.264
- Hey.
- Hey.

02:19.352 --> 02:21.178
- Great to have you back.
- Ah, thank you.

02:21.488 --> 02:23.970
Your body can rest, but on
this one we need your brain.

02:24.058 --> 02:25.588
Yeah, come on in, folks.

02:25.676 --> 02:27.549
I need your full attention
on this.

02:27.721 --> 02:30.448
The First National Trust
was just invaded.

02:30.647 --> 02:32.145
And, no, I did not misspeak.

02:32.232 --> 02:33.752
I say invaded
because it looks like

02:33.840 --> 02:36.505
nothing was actually taken,
so it's our job to find out

02:36.593 --> 02:38.594
who did this and why.

02:38.682 --> 02:39.820
Get settled in.

02:39.907 --> 02:41.455
Kelly, hook up with NYPD,

02:41.543 --> 02:43.312
start pulling video footage
from local businesses.

02:43.399 --> 02:44.573
On it.

02:44.661 --> 02:46.409
Maggie, OA,
you two head over to the scene

02:46.497 --> 02:47.619
and liaise with NYPD.

02:47.707 --> 02:48.728
All right,
I'll be right there.

02:48.815 --> 02:49.963
Yeah.

02:50.132 --> 02:51.505
- Hey, you.
- Hey.

02:51.593 --> 02:53.008
- How you feeling?
- I'm good.

02:53.096 --> 02:55.177
I'm good, my doctor
says I'm a fast healer.

02:55.265 --> 02:57.344
Should be ready to be
in the field in a few weeks.

02:57.432 --> 03:00.494
- Oh, wha... yeah.
- A few weeks?

03:01.079 --> 03:03.744
Just maybe seems a little soon?

03:03.836 --> 03:05.547
It isn't.
I mean, not for me.

03:05.635 --> 03:07.471
I-I wanna be back out there.

03:07.811 --> 03:11.252
- Okay, good. I'm glad you're back.
- Hm.

03:16.396 --> 03:19.145
The four of them were in
and out within three minutes.

03:19.404 --> 03:21.738
Any workable identifiers
on the suspects?

03:21.888 --> 03:23.840
You know,
arm or neck tattoos?

03:23.951 --> 03:25.267
Gloves and ski masks.

03:25.355 --> 03:27.222
All looked about the same
height and build.

03:27.349 --> 03:29.473
- What about outside?
- Did anyone see them arrive?

03:29.561 --> 03:31.377
We got a few wits so far,
but they all have

03:31.465 --> 03:33.715
the same limited description
as the folks in here.

03:33.803 --> 03:35.574
A brown sedan with no plates.

03:35.653 --> 03:36.878
Okay, and they didn't
take anything

03:36.965 --> 03:38.105
from the customers or tellers?

03:38.192 --> 03:40.884
Not that we could tell,
but the English speaking one

03:40.972 --> 03:42.440
took the manager's keys
and went

03:42.528 --> 03:43.943
into the safe deposit box room.

03:44.030 --> 03:45.319
English speaking one?

03:45.406 --> 03:46.925
One of the tellers
is Russian.

03:47.019 --> 03:48.941
She said a couple of them
were speaking Russian

03:49.029 --> 03:50.832
with a Chechen accent
to each other.

03:50.920 --> 03:52.418
- Good to know.
- Yeah.

03:52.526 --> 03:54.353
What'd the guy take from
the safe deposit box room?

03:54.440 --> 03:55.550
We're not so sure.

03:55.638 --> 03:57.379
He disabled the camera
with spray paint,

03:57.467 --> 03:59.285
so it's unknown
if he accessed any boxes.

03:59.373 --> 04:00.715
Okay, he leave the paint can?

04:00.803 --> 04:01.827
No such luck.

04:01.915 --> 04:04.623
Doesn't it take two keys
to unlock a safe deposit box?

04:04.711 --> 04:06.372
Yeah, so if he got into one,

04:06.460 --> 04:08.175
he'd have needed
a second key.

04:08.286 --> 04:10.058
Okay, thank you.

04:11.623 --> 04:12.941
Two of them spoke Chechen.

04:13.029 --> 04:14.808
Their focus was
that safe deposit box room.

04:14.896 --> 04:16.675
Yeah, this list of box owners
isn't showing

04:16.762 --> 04:18.494
any Chechen or Russian names.

04:18.582 --> 04:19.918
- Well, keep digging.
- These guys were well prepared.

04:20.005 --> 04:21.146
I'm not buying they left there

04:21.233 --> 04:23.191
without taking
what they came for.

04:23.493 --> 04:25.660
You know, the fact that
they did so much pre-planning

04:25.748 --> 04:27.496
- might work to our advantage.
- Why's that?

04:27.584 --> 04:29.394
Well, it means they did
a lot of recon, right?

04:29.600 --> 04:30.816
It's a good point.

04:30.904 --> 04:33.230
Hey, Kelly, you get that
street footage from NYPD?

04:33.318 --> 04:35.433
Yes, we're scouring through
a week's worth.

04:35.521 --> 04:37.872
Well, mine it for repetition,
same cars wiping through frame,

04:37.959 --> 04:39.511
same faces walking by.

04:39.599 --> 04:41.207
And prioritize the ID

04:41.295 --> 04:43.169
of anyone who looks
directly at the camera.

04:43.393 --> 04:44.605
- Anything?
- Yeah.

04:44.693 --> 04:47.738
Techs got a print of the AR-15
casings found at the bank.

04:47.882 --> 04:49.416
- Great.
- Check it out, we got a print.

04:49.503 --> 04:51.445
Paul Chambers,
retired military.

04:51.533 --> 04:53.472
Did two tours in Iraq.

04:53.560 --> 04:55.293
Didn't the witnesses say
these guys moved

04:55.389 --> 04:57.894
and held their weapons
in a military-like fashion?

04:58.771 --> 05:00.300
- Bring him in.
- He's already here.

05:00.388 --> 05:02.160
NYPD picked him up for us.

05:09.062 --> 05:10.965
Mind telling me
what this is about?

05:11.431 --> 05:12.543
Bank robbery.

05:12.631 --> 05:14.152
What bank robbery?

05:14.599 --> 05:16.260
What are you talking about?

05:17.059 --> 05:20.574
Your print was taken
from this expended AR-15 casing

05:20.662 --> 05:22.076
at the scene of a bank robbery.

05:22.164 --> 05:24.246
- So what?
- Doesn't mean I was there.

05:24.527 --> 05:27.621
I do reloads out of my garage
to subsidize my income.

05:27.709 --> 05:30.285
You'll find my print
on 1,000 cartridges.

05:30.572 --> 05:32.090
You speak any Chechen?

05:32.300 --> 05:33.449
No.

05:33.537 --> 05:35.327
It's not
on my bucket list, either.

05:35.620 --> 05:36.753
Look, I'm a veteran.

05:36.841 --> 05:39.382
I fought for this country,
and I obey its laws,

05:39.491 --> 05:43.199
so I'm offended if you think
I'm some type of foreign asset.

05:43.287 --> 05:46.480
Okay, then can you prove
where you were this morning?

05:52.871 --> 05:55.855
I was at the VA,
getting a new one of these.

05:59.237 --> 06:03.019
Any chance you keep records
of the ammunition you sell?

06:03.432 --> 06:05.957
Yeah, I'm very thorough
about that stuff.

06:06.160 --> 06:08.796
I have cameras that capture
all the transactions.

06:08.883 --> 06:11.337
- We'll need that footage.
- Not a problem.

06:13.353 --> 06:14.548
Isobel.

06:14.636 --> 06:16.330
Okay, where we at?

06:16.418 --> 06:19.095
13 people purchased
AR-15 rounds from Chambers.

06:19.183 --> 06:22.391
All paid in credit card
with the exception of this man.

06:22.560 --> 06:25.486
He used a fake ID, but we
managed to pull a screen grab

06:25.574 --> 06:27.939
of him from the security
footage Chambers supplied.

06:28.034 --> 06:31.775
Ran it through facial rec
and got a match on Frank Ryan.

06:32.111 --> 06:33.829
Does he have any priors?

06:34.019 --> 06:37.080
Did a year at Rikers for
assault with a deadly weapon.

06:37.203 --> 06:38.556
Do we have an address
on him?

06:38.644 --> 06:40.702
Parole officer says
that Ryan's been living

06:40.790 --> 06:43.080
in a room
above his buddy's metal shop.

06:43.167 --> 06:44.831
He's authorized a hold
when we pick Ryan up.

06:44.918 --> 06:46.790
What's the parole officer's
temperature on this?

06:46.877 --> 06:50.478
He said Ryan's a violent guy
who won't go easy.

06:50.680 --> 06:53.486
Okay, get that address
over to Maggie and OA.

06:53.574 --> 06:54.932
Let's not take
any chances on this.

06:55.019 --> 06:57.148
- I want SWAT taking him down.
- Yes, ma'am.

07:04.589 --> 07:06.056
Go.

07:10.236 --> 07:11.445
Stand by.

07:17.313 --> 07:18.352
Hit it.

07:21.143 --> 07:23.171
FBI!

07:23.724 --> 07:25.226
Clear.

07:28.811 --> 07:30.890
On me. Hold.

07:34.159 --> 07:34.992
<i>Cover this!</i>

07:35.088 --> 07:36.507
- We have shots fired.
- Engaging.

07:36.595 --> 07:37.601
Go, go.

07:37.689 --> 07:39.107
Leader team,
weapon hot!

07:41.058 --> 07:43.015
Down, down!

07:43.102 --> 07:44.516
Run the walls!

07:44.603 --> 07:45.517
- Where, where?
- You got him?

07:45.604 --> 07:47.857
Yo, Sam-12, hold the stairs!

07:49.818 --> 07:51.236
Under that!

07:52.321 --> 07:53.425
There, you see him?

07:54.891 --> 07:57.128
Check the wall.
D, check the wall!

07:59.386 --> 08:01.388
Hold shot!
Flanking!

08:06.458 --> 08:09.441
Frank Ryan.
It's Agent Bell.

08:09.529 --> 08:11.566
Put your weapon down
and step out!

08:11.668 --> 08:12.739
Otherwise you're gonna end up

08:12.826 --> 08:14.253
on the ground
with your friends.

08:14.341 --> 08:16.113
What's it gonna be?

08:17.341 --> 08:18.922
I give up.

08:19.228 --> 08:20.527
I give up.
Don't shoot.

08:22.722 --> 08:24.550
All right,
start perimeter check.

08:24.998 --> 08:26.300
Turn around.

08:27.218 --> 08:30.357
On your knees,
hands behind your back.

08:34.794 --> 08:36.912
Stand by.
Two suspects down.

08:39.184 --> 08:40.600
You've been
a busy guy, Frank.

08:40.804 --> 08:42.583
- Hm?
- First a bank robbery,

08:42.684 --> 08:44.472
now attempted murder
on federal agents.

08:46.618 --> 08:48.357
Sit down.

08:49.021 --> 08:50.187
So the hole
they're gonna throw you in

08:50.274 --> 08:51.629
doesn't really get
that much deeper.

08:51.716 --> 08:52.841
Yeah, I get it.

08:52.929 --> 08:54.390
So why don't you help us
do the math then?

08:54.477 --> 08:57.393
You plus your two dead friends
makes three,

08:57.481 --> 08:58.849
So who's the fourth player?

08:58.937 --> 09:01.357
Why should I tell you that?
Hm?

09:01.659 --> 09:03.466
You gonna cut me a deal?

09:03.829 --> 09:05.787
That depends
on what you tell us.

09:07.253 --> 09:10.105
His name's Adam,
but I have no idea where he is.

09:10.193 --> 09:12.084
We just reconnected last week.

09:12.227 --> 09:14.893
We knew the guy from being
special ops in Syria.

09:15.034 --> 09:17.157
Worked some security detail
stuff with him.

09:17.245 --> 09:19.029
So your two friends
were mercenaries as well?

09:19.117 --> 09:21.533
Yeah, cut their teeth
in the Chechen conflict.

09:21.748 --> 09:25.185
So why would you rob a bank
and not take any money?

09:25.415 --> 09:27.556
Adam needed something
out of a safety deposit box.

09:27.644 --> 09:29.070
Wouldn't tell us what it was.

09:29.158 --> 09:30.654
How do we find Adam now?

09:31.708 --> 09:34.271
Where's he staying?
Hotel, apartment?

09:34.359 --> 09:35.857
I honestly don't know.

09:35.944 --> 09:37.896
See, Frank,
if you don't help us,

09:38.037 --> 09:39.621
then why would we help you?

09:40.257 --> 09:43.121
Night before the bank job,
Adam asked me to pick him up

09:43.209 --> 09:45.552
on a street corner
and drive him to a building.

09:45.787 --> 09:48.904
A lot of foot traffic
in the place, so I was lookout

09:48.992 --> 09:52.256
in the hallway while he picked
the lock and went inside.

09:52.669 --> 09:54.751
What'd he steal?
Not sure.

09:54.905 --> 09:56.753
But he was in there
for a while.

09:56.967 --> 09:59.089
Okay, well, do you know
the address of this condo?

10:02.106 --> 10:03.303
<i>FBI.</i>

10:10.626 --> 10:13.166
- Clear.
- Clear.

10:13.434 --> 10:16.483
Well, Adam was definitely
searching for something.

10:18.864 --> 10:20.436
Whoa.

10:29.319 --> 10:30.796
I'm gonna get Kristen to run
the owner

10:30.883 --> 10:32.702
- of this place,
- Dave Johnson.

10:33.472 --> 10:35.137
She's doing pretty good

10:35.522 --> 10:37.373
considering everything
she's been through.

10:37.842 --> 10:39.170
Yeah.

10:39.257 --> 10:41.756
You know, she wants to get back
in the field in three weeks.

10:42.288 --> 10:43.674
- Really?
- Yep.

10:43.762 --> 10:46.741
Jumping into work doesn't make
the trauma go away.

10:52.521 --> 10:54.811
Whoa.
This can't be a coincidence.

10:55.065 --> 10:57.355
Johnson banked
at First National Trust.

10:57.522 --> 10:58.803
Same bank as the robbery.

10:58.952 --> 11:01.484
I bet he has
a safe deposit box there too.

11:05.968 --> 11:08.091
Dave Johnson has had
a safe deposit box

11:08.179 --> 11:09.804
at First National Trust
for the last three years.

11:09.891 --> 11:11.812
Okay, so given that
the robbery team hit his house,

11:11.899 --> 11:13.338
let's assume his box
was the target.

11:13.426 --> 11:14.532
Question is why.

11:14.620 --> 11:15.624
I don't know.

11:15.712 --> 11:17.314
I've been running him,
and he seems pretty boring.

11:17.401 --> 11:19.164
- Yeah?
- Not even a speeding ticket.

11:19.275 --> 11:20.922
He works
as a financial advisor,

11:21.010 --> 11:22.425
and he died
less than a week ago

11:22.513 --> 11:24.008
of a heart attack
at his office.

11:24.096 --> 11:25.523
Maggie said the neighbor
mentioned family.

11:25.610 --> 11:27.352
Any shifty cousins named Adam?

11:27.440 --> 11:30.815
Mm, he has a sister out west
but no Adams that I could find.

11:31.017 --> 11:33.381
So whatever was in
Johnson's safe deposit box

11:33.469 --> 11:35.555
would have been turned over
to his sister,

11:35.643 --> 11:37.797
which is why Adam needed
to get into it first.

11:37.885 --> 11:40.469
But did he get it,
or is it still in the box?

11:40.557 --> 11:42.726
Only one way to find out.

11:47.598 --> 11:49.646
I'll need a copy
of the contents you seize

11:49.741 --> 11:51.188
- for our records.
- Yeah, of course.

11:51.276 --> 11:54.078
But we've got a suspicion
that it might be empty.

11:59.649 --> 12:01.110
Definitely not empty.

12:12.081 --> 12:14.188
There's at least
40 grand in cash here.

12:14.352 --> 12:15.696
Means if Adam got access,

12:15.784 --> 12:17.696
whatever he took
was more valuable.

12:19.604 --> 12:21.563
This passport is a forgery.

12:23.280 --> 12:24.867
It's a good one
but definitely fake.

12:24.955 --> 12:26.203
It's got Johnson's picture,

12:26.291 --> 12:27.539
but he's using
a different name.

12:27.627 --> 12:29.446
Any travel stamps?

12:30.160 --> 12:33.032
Yeah, a bunch,
all to the Caymans.

12:33.120 --> 12:34.142
Well, that makes sense.

12:34.230 --> 12:36.110
These look like
foreign bank account numbers...

12:36.198 --> 12:39.149
Passwords included, which means
they'll be easy to track.

12:40.145 --> 12:43.492
So maybe Johnson was doing
a little money laundering.

12:43.632 --> 12:44.875
Hm.

12:45.360 --> 12:48.696
And since this was torn open,
whatever Adam took

12:48.784 --> 12:50.688
was probably kept inside it.

12:53.478 --> 12:55.314
Hey, Kelly, where are we
on those account numbers?

12:55.401 --> 12:56.440
We came up dry.

12:56.528 --> 12:58.068
They were all closed out
two days ago.

12:58.156 --> 12:59.946
Cayman bank
is refusing to cooperate

13:00.034 --> 13:01.573
because of
confidentiality issues.

13:01.661 --> 13:02.985
Hey.
Yeah?

13:03.073 --> 13:05.446
- Got something.
- What's that?

13:05.534 --> 13:06.610
Who is that?

13:06.698 --> 13:08.500
That's our
fourth bank robber,

13:08.588 --> 13:10.383
Ryan's mysterious friend, Adam.

13:10.471 --> 13:13.094
Yo, yo, people, check it out,
our fourth bank robber.

13:13.182 --> 13:14.469
How'd you run him down?

13:14.557 --> 13:17.108
Remember Ryan said he gave
Adam a ride to Johnson's condo?

13:17.196 --> 13:18.743
- Yeah.
- Had his car dusted for prints.

13:18.830 --> 13:21.039
Pulled a clean one off
the passenger side door handle.

13:21.378 --> 13:24.227
Okay, so this guy's full name
is Adam Mizrah.

13:24.315 --> 13:25.961
He's 40 years old,
and our records indicate

13:26.048 --> 13:27.367
he is ex-Mossad.

13:27.455 --> 13:28.953
I've been tracking
his credit cards.

13:29.041 --> 13:30.789
He's had a rental car
for about a week,

13:31.319 --> 13:33.977
and he just booked
a flight to Tel Aviv.

13:34.065 --> 13:35.981
It's scheduled to leave JFK
in less than two hours.

13:36.068 --> 13:37.742
Okay, get Maggie and OA
that information.

13:37.830 --> 13:39.759
Have them intercept him
before he gets on that plane.

13:39.846 --> 13:41.313
Already done.

13:50.164 --> 13:52.035
<i>- We're gonna be late. Come on.
- All right.</i>

13:52.123 --> 13:54.446
FBI.
Let me see your hands.

13:55.369 --> 13:56.951
Sure, is there a problem?

13:57.039 --> 13:58.749
Yes, we'd like to ask
you some questions.

14:00.317 --> 14:02.141
On him!

14:05.072 --> 14:06.072
Stop!

14:18.213 --> 14:19.625
Ah.

14:20.531 --> 14:22.882
- Get down!
- Hands behind your back.

14:36.593 --> 14:38.220
You recognize anyone?

14:41.530 --> 14:43.155
Nope.

14:43.804 --> 14:45.757
Two out of these
three people are dead,

14:46.353 --> 14:47.684
but not Frank Ryan.

14:47.874 --> 14:49.687
He just identified you
in a photo lineup.

14:49.775 --> 14:52.366
He said you were
a ringleader of sorts.

14:59.142 --> 15:00.431
What's up?

15:00.549 --> 15:03.288
Yeah, this is
Agent Dawson, NSA.

15:03.376 --> 15:04.291
- Hey.
- Hi.

15:04.379 --> 15:06.593
What's the NSA's interest
in this?

15:06.810 --> 15:09.601
We have a sealed indictment
on Adam Mizrah.

15:09.689 --> 15:10.698
For what?

15:10.786 --> 15:13.118
A data breach in one of
our Damascus operations.

15:13.444 --> 15:14.733
- Espionage?
- Yeah.

15:14.821 --> 15:18.398
One that resulted in a dozen of
our local assets being killed.

15:19.382 --> 15:20.521
So you're taking our suspect.

15:20.608 --> 15:22.319
No, no, the reason
the indictment

15:22.407 --> 15:25.700
is sealed is because not all of
the players have been ID'd yet,

15:25.809 --> 15:28.036
and we're not ready
to make an arrest.

15:28.124 --> 15:30.757
Okay, so why were we pulled
out of the interview?

15:30.859 --> 15:32.607
'Cause I know Mizrah.

15:32.694 --> 15:34.851
He won't speak unless you have
leverage on him.

15:35.468 --> 15:37.074
Our indictment gives you that.

15:39.863 --> 15:41.874
So I tell you about this,

15:42.585 --> 15:45.046
and the Damascus thing
goes away?

15:45.671 --> 15:47.716
If you cooperate fully
and plead guilty

15:47.804 --> 15:48.957
to the bank robbery,
yeah.

15:49.044 --> 15:50.374
You'll get ten years max.

15:50.462 --> 15:51.773
Ten years?

15:54.423 --> 15:57.006
Espionage that results in
people getting killed

15:57.094 --> 15:59.780
has a lot longer tail
than that, Adam.

16:04.535 --> 16:07.624
Okay, so I was hired
to rob a bank, and I did.

16:07.712 --> 16:08.827
Now what?

16:08.915 --> 16:10.853
Now you tell us
who hired you to rob it.

16:10.949 --> 16:13.286
It was a guy who needed me
to recover a memory stick

16:13.374 --> 16:15.421
from his buddy's
safe deposit box.

16:15.509 --> 16:17.421
So what was on the stick
that was so important?

16:17.509 --> 16:18.882
I don't know,
and I didn't want to.

16:18.970 --> 16:21.655
Okay, what is the name
of the guy who hired you?

16:25.525 --> 16:26.818
Sentinel.

16:28.292 --> 16:29.530
A hacker.

16:29.618 --> 16:31.585
I've done stuff for him
in the past...

16:32.686 --> 16:34.351
Like the Damascus job.

16:37.286 --> 16:38.784
How do we find him?

16:39.172 --> 16:40.800
Never met him face to face.

16:40.887 --> 16:42.677
He sent me instructions
from burners.

16:42.795 --> 16:44.589
Okay, where's
the memory stick?

16:50.189 --> 16:51.994
I dropped it
in a trash can

16:52.148 --> 16:54.384
outside the Museum
of Natural History

16:54.578 --> 16:56.072
about three hours ago.

17:00.719 --> 17:01.800
Hey.

17:01.888 --> 17:03.228
Hey.

17:03.636 --> 17:05.806
Okay,
so Sentinel's a big deal?

17:05.894 --> 17:06.914
Very big.

17:07.002 --> 17:08.736
He's a world class hacker
who steals

17:08.824 --> 17:10.656
highly classified information
then sells it back

17:10.742 --> 17:11.823
to the people he stole it from.

17:11.910 --> 17:13.267
Mm-kay.
What kind of information?

17:13.368 --> 17:15.390
According to his file,
anything of value.

17:15.478 --> 17:17.337
Nuclear facility blueprints,

17:17.425 --> 17:19.345
lists of detained
political prisoners...

17:19.433 --> 17:21.013
If it is
sensitive and important,

17:21.102 --> 17:22.432
he will steal it.

17:22.520 --> 17:25.144
And, as you can imagine,
if all of those stolen secrets

17:25.232 --> 17:28.207
are on that stick, it is
of interest to us and the NSA.

17:28.401 --> 17:30.214
What is he, some kind
of truth crusader?

17:30.312 --> 17:31.685
No, no,
he's a shameless capitalist.

17:31.772 --> 17:32.812
Does everything for money.

17:32.920 --> 17:35.271
Those assets in Damascus
died because he sold

17:35.359 --> 17:37.065
their identities
to the other side.

17:37.152 --> 17:38.214
But you're the NSA.

17:38.302 --> 17:39.761
Why haven't you
tracked him down before now?

17:39.848 --> 17:40.846
Two reasons.

17:40.934 --> 17:43.308
One, he's good
at staying off-grid.

17:43.491 --> 17:46.503
Two,
we're not really looking.

17:46.612 --> 17:47.854
What?
Why?

17:47.942 --> 17:50.752
He's made it clear
to everyone he's ever extorted

17:50.840 --> 17:53.211
that if he were
captured or killed,

17:53.299 --> 17:55.573
the information
that he had stolen

17:55.753 --> 17:57.964
would immediately
be made public.

17:58.272 --> 18:01.010
Dead man's switch.
The memory stick.

18:02.035 --> 18:04.442
Yeah, he said
the second he was killed

18:04.530 --> 18:07.706
or arrested, his proxy,
this guy Johnson,

18:07.794 --> 18:09.807
would release
all the information.

18:09.895 --> 18:12.185
We didn't want to incur
that kind of risk.

18:12.374 --> 18:14.823
We?
What are you talking about?

18:28.571 --> 18:31.120
This information
cannot leave this room.

18:32.191 --> 18:34.518
Six months ago,
Sentinel hacked the mainframe

18:34.606 --> 18:37.276
of this field office,
and we quietly paid him

18:37.364 --> 18:39.737
$2 million
to keep his mouth shut.

18:40.811 --> 18:42.104
What'd he get?

18:42.192 --> 18:44.018
The names of every
confidential informant

18:44.106 --> 18:45.573
we have ever used.

18:45.869 --> 18:48.690
So we don't just have to
find Sentinel.

18:48.908 --> 18:50.785
The lives of these informants
and their families

18:50.872 --> 18:53.253
are at risk if we don't get
the stick back as well.

18:59.192 --> 19:01.883
Kelly, we pull the footage
from the museum security feed?

19:01.978 --> 19:03.565
Yes, we got it queued up
to the moment

19:03.653 --> 19:05.495
where Mizrah makes the drop.

19:05.628 --> 19:07.710
Okay, he places it
in the trash can.

19:08.025 --> 19:09.495
Can you punch in?

19:09.630 --> 19:11.901
And there's the mystery man
picking it up.

19:12.018 --> 19:13.760
All right, play it back,
freeze on his face.

19:13.848 --> 19:14.870
- Hey, Jubal?
- Yeah.

19:14.958 --> 19:17.112
- Already ran facial rec. We got a hit.
- Great.

19:17.200 --> 19:18.846
This guy's name
is James Leavins.

19:18.934 --> 19:21.336
He's 38. He works at a
software company in Brooklyn.

19:21.423 --> 19:22.549
Uh-huh.
Take a look!

19:22.637 --> 19:23.643
Hey,

19:23.731 --> 19:25.596
- I've been taking a look at his bio.
- Hm?

19:25.892 --> 19:27.594
No criminal record,
but apparently

19:27.682 --> 19:29.430
he graduated top of his class
at MIT.

19:29.518 --> 19:31.282
All right, kids,
to steal a phrase

19:31.370 --> 19:32.826
from our computer geek friends,

19:32.987 --> 19:34.946
Sentinel just made
a fatal error.

19:35.105 --> 19:36.481
Let's make him pay.

19:45.251 --> 19:46.542
James Leavins?

19:46.684 --> 19:48.464
- Yeah.
- We need to speak with you.

19:48.792 --> 19:50.571
Sure.
Can we go inside?

19:50.659 --> 19:51.761
Yeah.

19:58.190 --> 19:59.970
I'm kind of getting
freaked out here.

20:00.058 --> 20:01.728
Can you tell me
what this is about?

20:01.815 --> 20:03.292
Where's the memory stick?

20:03.651 --> 20:04.909
Is it on you?

20:04.997 --> 20:06.347
In your office, your car?

20:06.660 --> 20:08.162
Memory stick?

20:09.213 --> 20:10.502
Wait, wait, what's this?

20:10.590 --> 20:13.495
This is you doing
a little dumpster diving.

20:13.620 --> 20:16.222
But that's not me.

20:16.603 --> 20:18.519
Well, we know
the footage isn't lying.

20:18.845 --> 20:21.288
That is you four hours ago
picking up the memory stick

20:21.376 --> 20:23.300
from the Museum
of Natural History.

20:23.503 --> 20:25.416
- Four hours ago?
- Eah.

20:27.393 --> 20:28.797
Oh, thank God, look,
I knew this

20:28.884 --> 20:30.322
had to be a misunderstanding.

20:30.410 --> 20:32.019
I was just at
a client presentation.

20:32.107 --> 20:35.861
I-I flew in from Boston less than
half an hour ago.

20:36.391 --> 20:39.026
So whoever that is,
it isn't me.

20:39.394 --> 20:40.760
Check for yourself.

20:46.340 --> 20:48.182
Any other hits
on facial rec?

20:48.315 --> 20:50.147
No, no matter
how many times I run it,

20:50.235 --> 20:51.385
it comes back to Leavins.

20:51.473 --> 20:52.845
It doesn't make
any sense.

20:53.045 --> 20:54.920
I mean, if it was as simple
as a false positive,

20:55.007 --> 20:56.682
I might buy it,
but the probability

20:56.770 --> 20:59.394
that it would ID a man
who has the exact background

20:59.544 --> 21:02.565
that Sentinel might have...
It defies the odds.

21:02.653 --> 21:04.321
Are we sure that
the boarding pass is legit?

21:04.408 --> 21:05.743
We confirmed
that he was in the air

21:05.830 --> 21:06.838
at the time of the drop.

21:06.926 --> 21:08.901
It's impossible for him to be
the man in that video.

21:08.988 --> 21:11.986
Oh, guys, I think I just
figured out what's going on.

21:12.074 --> 21:14.768
What we've been watching
is a deepfake video.

21:15.051 --> 21:16.341
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

21:16.429 --> 21:18.594
I slowed the feed,
and I studied the frames.

21:18.682 --> 21:20.097
I didn't notice
any irregularities

21:20.185 --> 21:22.252
until the suspect turned
directly into the camera.

21:22.340 --> 21:23.549
Look.

21:23.943 --> 21:25.932
You see how the footage
gets a little wonky?

21:26.020 --> 21:27.268
That shows
it's been manipulated,

21:27.355 --> 21:29.127
and only in the facial area.

21:29.263 --> 21:33.477
Great, so Sentinel accessed
the museum's security footage

21:33.565 --> 21:34.651
and manipulated it.

21:34.739 --> 21:36.135
Yes, it looks like it.

21:36.244 --> 21:38.572
Well, if this guy's got
such fancy tech skills,

21:38.660 --> 21:40.180
I guess we're gonna
have to go analog,

21:40.268 --> 21:41.977
boots on the ground.
Grab Emily and Scola,

21:42.065 --> 21:43.163
head down to the museum,

21:43.223 --> 21:44.752
start canvassing
for witnesses.

21:44.840 --> 21:46.755
Show people the picture
of that hoodie.

21:46.843 --> 21:48.816
Let's catch this son of a bitch
the old-fashioned way.

21:48.903 --> 21:50.705
Now the director
is monitoring us,

21:50.793 --> 21:52.768
so let's not disappoint him.

21:55.778 --> 21:57.643
He's taking
a personal interest in this?

21:58.092 --> 22:00.065
Yeah, so failure
is not an option.

22:00.541 --> 22:01.890
Right.

22:05.174 --> 22:06.752
- Do you recognize that hoodie?
- Mm-mm.

22:10.560 --> 22:13.057
You walk this route a lot?
Six days a week.

22:13.145 --> 22:14.977
Do you remember a guy dressed
in this hoodie?

22:15.065 --> 22:18.147
Sorry, buddy, I'm wrestling
this bag all the way.

22:18.235 --> 22:20.424
I don't get
to look around much.

22:22.303 --> 22:24.439
- Hey, question for you.
- Yeah.

22:25.336 --> 22:28.002
See a guy wearing this hoodie
about five hours ago?

22:28.106 --> 22:29.729
Yeah, I remember him
and that watch.

22:29.926 --> 22:31.643
- It's a classic.
- Serious?

22:31.762 --> 22:33.544
Yeah, well, hard to forget
a weirdo like that.

22:33.631 --> 22:35.027
Comes two,
three times a week,

22:35.115 --> 22:36.816
eats the dog
and throws away the bun.

22:36.904 --> 22:38.109
Who does that?

22:38.346 --> 22:39.715
I... did you see
which way he went?

22:39.803 --> 22:41.379
Yeah, he walked north.

22:41.615 --> 22:43.457
Did he get into a cab
or an Uber by any chance?

22:43.545 --> 22:44.590
Nah, he lives close by.

22:44.678 --> 22:46.384
I'm not sure where but close,
you know?

22:46.472 --> 22:48.638
But am I wrong?
What's a dog without a bun?

22:48.820 --> 22:50.435
- Nah, nah, you're right, yeah.
- I mean, what is it?

22:50.522 --> 22:51.895
That's what I'm saying.

22:51.983 --> 22:53.603
Okay, so Maggie thinks
they're in his neighborhood,

22:53.690 --> 22:55.012
but they can't figure out
which address.

22:55.099 --> 22:56.627
- Which block?
- Zero hundred block

22:56.715 --> 22:57.996
of West 82nd street.

22:58.115 --> 23:00.629
Okay, I just finished going
through a GPS record dump

23:00.717 --> 23:01.965
on Johnson's cell phone.

23:02.053 --> 23:03.497
I figured if he was
Sentinel's accountant,

23:03.584 --> 23:05.020
they must have met
face to face

23:05.108 --> 23:06.348
at least
once in a while, right?

23:06.436 --> 23:07.583
There you go.
Anything on 82nd?

23:07.670 --> 23:09.816
Well, not on 82nd,
but I do show him making

23:09.904 --> 23:12.152
several visits to an address
just north of there.

23:12.296 --> 23:14.879
Yeah?
32 West 84th Street.

23:14.967 --> 23:16.988
It's a brownstone owned by
a guy named Kenneth Bates.

23:17.075 --> 23:18.207
Kelly, run him.

23:18.295 --> 23:19.381
Okay.

23:19.469 --> 23:21.384
Kenneth Bates, 40,
male, white.

23:21.472 --> 23:22.761
What does he do
for a living?

23:22.849 --> 23:24.182
Software engineer,
self-employed.

23:25.227 --> 23:26.168
All right,
tell Maggie and OA

23:26.256 --> 23:27.546
to get eyes
on that address right away.

23:27.633 --> 23:29.397
I'll make a phone call and get
a search warrant signed.

23:29.484 --> 23:31.103
Yes, ma'am.
Nice work.

23:43.713 --> 23:44.774
FBI!

23:46.368 --> 23:48.203
All right, here we go.

23:49.120 --> 23:50.952
Kenneth Bates, FBI!

23:51.226 --> 23:52.458
Down!

23:55.019 --> 23:56.308
Heading up.

23:56.403 --> 23:57.889
Alpha team, get hot.

24:00.224 --> 24:01.545
Anything?

24:03.210 --> 24:05.083
<i>Got nothing.
Open space, straight.</i>

24:05.357 --> 24:06.951
<i>Eyes front, guys.</i>

24:15.735 --> 24:17.867
<i>Top side,
third floor clear.</i>

24:20.605 --> 24:21.978
Master's clear.

24:22.066 --> 24:23.561
Front room clear.

24:24.152 --> 24:25.695
Kitchen's clear.

24:27.846 --> 24:29.422
Upstairs clear.

24:33.835 --> 24:35.547
Location is clear.

24:37.410 --> 24:40.000
It's OA... notify Jubal
that the suspect isn't home.

24:44.198 --> 24:46.426
Hey, so we
searched the house.

24:46.514 --> 24:47.836
He wasn't there.

24:48.650 --> 24:50.110
I should have made them
wait for a visual

24:50.197 --> 24:51.328
before making entry.

24:51.416 --> 24:53.123
He's gonna go
to the ground for sure.

24:53.211 --> 24:54.792
Well, it's not game over yet.

24:54.962 --> 24:56.726
We're still the best team
in the Bureau.

24:57.359 --> 24:58.586
I know that.

24:58.674 --> 25:01.008
Just keep me in the loop.
I'm gonna update the director.

25:01.111 --> 25:02.111
Yeah.

25:05.660 --> 25:06.859
Isobel...

25:08.707 --> 25:10.054
This isn't your fault.

25:12.850 --> 25:14.453
We're the FBI.

25:14.664 --> 25:16.935
We always get our man,
and if we don't,

25:17.023 --> 25:19.290
the man upstairs points
to the man downstairs,

25:19.377 --> 25:22.218
or in this case the woman.

25:34.015 --> 25:36.297
Looks like he left hungry
and in a hurry.

25:36.385 --> 25:37.437
I checked the bedroom.

25:37.524 --> 25:39.522
No sign of bags being packed
or drawers being emptied.

25:39.609 --> 25:41.250
Okay, all right, a BOLO
has been sent out

25:41.338 --> 25:43.295
to all airports,
train stations, and bus depots.

25:43.401 --> 25:44.881
The only way this guy's
gonna get out of town

25:44.968 --> 25:46.258
is by car or on foot.

25:46.404 --> 25:47.695
Okay,
let's keep searching, okay?

25:47.783 --> 25:50.103
Maybe we'll get lucky,
and he left the memory stick behind.

26:01.085 --> 26:03.654
Um, how long was SWAT
sitting on this house

26:03.742 --> 26:04.771
before we hit the door?

26:04.859 --> 26:06.838
Hm, about 20, 30 minutes?

26:06.925 --> 26:09.679
Well, the dishwasher
was running a 20 minute cycle.

26:11.163 --> 26:12.203
Does it have
a timer function?

26:12.290 --> 26:13.997
No, it has to be
set manually.

26:16.835 --> 26:18.682
Guys, Bates might
still be in this house.

26:18.825 --> 26:20.047
Question is where.

26:23.217 --> 26:24.460
Find him, boy.

26:52.460 --> 26:54.336
That's not drywall.
That's metal.

27:03.611 --> 27:04.921
We're in.

27:09.654 --> 27:11.569
FBI!
Come out with your hands up!

27:17.428 --> 27:18.959
Well, let's hope
he wasn't lying to Mizrah

27:19.046 --> 27:20.584
when he said this was
one of a kind.

27:20.672 --> 27:21.482
If there was more,

27:21.570 --> 27:23.124
he could've just had
Mizrah destroy it.

27:23.390 --> 27:24.602
I think the fact
that he wanted it back

27:24.689 --> 27:26.005
means that's the only one.

27:26.093 --> 27:27.279
Yeah, well,
I'm gonna hand this

27:27.366 --> 27:29.296
to the director personally.

27:29.898 --> 27:32.110
So this is
the infamous Sentinel.

27:32.198 --> 27:33.325
Yep.

27:42.046 --> 27:44.138
Would either of you
care to tell me

27:44.226 --> 27:45.865
exactly what it is
I'm being

27:46.819 --> 27:47.919
charged with?

27:48.007 --> 27:49.473
What aren't you
being charged with?

27:49.560 --> 27:52.601
Yeah, we've got bank robbery,
espionage, blackmail.

27:52.689 --> 27:55.271
I mean, do I really need
to go down the list?

27:55.359 --> 28:00.027
Well, what if I were to tell
the two of you...

28:00.390 --> 28:02.075
Uh, what was it now?

28:02.163 --> 28:03.341
Oh, yes.

28:03.429 --> 28:06.351
There exists a bomb

28:06.811 --> 28:10.828
in the New York Stock Exchange,
which you might have heard of,

28:10.915 --> 28:15.473
and it's all set to go off
tomorrow morning, I believe,

28:15.561 --> 28:18.296
right at the bell.

28:19.715 --> 28:21.213
<i>Give it up, Bates.</i>

28:21.339 --> 28:22.588
You don't have
a card to play here.

28:22.675 --> 28:24.327
You're not walking
away from this.

28:26.193 --> 28:29.319
Look at you
all proud and confident.

28:29.476 --> 28:32.349
Listen, um, Agent Bell, right?

28:32.436 --> 28:34.184
Would you do me a favor,
please?

28:34.271 --> 28:36.163
Don't feel bad, okay?

28:36.288 --> 28:39.630
Because the truth is,
you're not the first person

28:39.718 --> 28:42.733
who has
underestimated me.

28:44.086 --> 28:45.546
Is that right?

28:47.585 --> 28:49.311
Yes, that is right.

28:49.787 --> 28:52.995
I'm pretty much
a magician with algorithms,

28:53.082 --> 28:56.476
and I know how to penetrate
firewalls in a far more...

28:56.614 --> 28:58.809
magnificent way
than you can ever imagine,

28:58.897 --> 29:02.838
and, because of this,
two days ago I got a hit

29:03.038 --> 29:05.921
on some North Korean chatter
I was monitoring.

29:06.035 --> 29:10.952
Excuse me, OA, do you smell
that desperation in the air?

29:11.163 --> 29:13.382
I do.
It's pretty thick.

29:13.470 --> 29:15.677
I discovered
that an operative

29:15.765 --> 29:18.222
has spent the last four weeks
sneaking each component

29:18.310 --> 29:22.774
of this bomb onto
the traders floor of the NYSE

29:22.862 --> 29:27.946
and now, ooh, by golly,
if it isn't assembled

29:28.143 --> 29:30.885
and pretty much ready to...

29:32.690 --> 29:33.938
Blow.

29:36.289 --> 29:39.580
Bombs, North Koreans,
operatives,

29:39.837 --> 29:42.806
the New York City
Stock exchange, really?

29:42.902 --> 29:45.735
It does sound a bit humorous,
however I just...

29:45.853 --> 29:49.717
...I don't... believe
that this particular bomb

29:49.805 --> 29:54.172
will be too terribly... um,
what's the word?

29:54.260 --> 29:55.619
Funny.

29:55.707 --> 29:58.898
I mean, after all,
hundreds will be killed,

29:58.986 --> 30:01.135
and the world's economy
will be decimated.

30:01.223 --> 30:04.222
And, by the way,
when the world finds out

30:04.392 --> 30:08.705
that I told the mighty FBI
all about this bomb,

30:09.191 --> 30:10.767
you two...

30:12.260 --> 30:14.252
will be held responsible.

30:17.894 --> 30:20.486
He's bluffing
and doing a bad job of it.

30:20.730 --> 30:23.002
No, he's not known
for bluffing.

30:23.253 --> 30:25.947
<i>Run along, have
a little chat with the NSA</i>

30:26.042 --> 30:29.757
because I promise you
they will confirm

30:29.845 --> 30:32.400
that they have been hearing
a lot of chatter

30:32.488 --> 30:33.944
coming from
the North Koreans lately.

30:34.032 --> 30:35.361
Please.

30:36.556 --> 30:37.599
Prove it.

30:39.160 --> 30:42.250
I happen to have a King Air
parked over at Teterboro,

30:42.338 --> 30:43.145
and guess what.

30:43.233 --> 30:44.523
As soon as I'm safely
in the air,

30:44.610 --> 30:45.941
I will be
more than pleased

30:46.028 --> 30:49.861
to relay the exact location
of the bomb.

30:50.107 --> 30:52.690
You think that we're
gonna let you fly out of here

30:52.778 --> 30:55.986
on your plane behind
that fantastical claim?

30:56.074 --> 31:00.744
Somebody above you is
taking me very, very seriously,

31:00.918 --> 31:06.369
so I would much prefer
to talk to her.

31:06.916 --> 31:10.205
Yeah, you guys might
wanna wake up.

31:10.293 --> 31:13.543
I told you I know...

31:13.670 --> 31:14.709
everything.

31:14.806 --> 31:17.338
Isobel Castille?

31:19.984 --> 31:22.399
Yes, that is her name.
Well done.

31:22.563 --> 31:23.776
Yeah.

31:23.864 --> 31:25.071
But she's not taking
you seriously enough

31:25.158 --> 31:27.281
to agree
without some more facts,

31:27.369 --> 31:29.284
so what's it gonna be?

31:29.516 --> 31:31.730
You know, I got
a funny feeling she will,

31:31.818 --> 31:35.430
and I got
an even funnier feeling

31:35.619 --> 31:39.329
that I'm done talking
to the two of you.

31:41.250 --> 31:46.293
Oh, Isobel, would you be
so kind as to join us?

31:46.434 --> 31:47.682
<i>I know you're watching.</i>

31:57.213 --> 31:58.853
Ta-da.

32:01.592 --> 32:02.840
Have we met?

32:02.928 --> 32:07.907
No, I just do my homework
like a good boy.

32:08.066 --> 32:10.876
So, Isobel, here's how
this is gonna go.

32:10.964 --> 32:15.235
When I am in the air and only
when I'm safely in the air,

32:15.323 --> 32:18.704
then you'll get all
the information you need.

32:18.854 --> 32:21.337
If you're telling the truth,
then you're a free man,

32:21.425 --> 32:23.438
so why do you need
to get in the air?

32:23.526 --> 32:27.610
Well, Isobel, because thanks
so much to all of you guys,

32:27.698 --> 32:29.321
everyone knows
I'm Sentinel now,

32:29.422 --> 32:30.852
and guess what.

32:30.940 --> 32:35.399
If I don't hide now,
then I will very quickly end up

32:35.518 --> 32:37.850
well within
the territory of dead.

32:37.976 --> 32:41.618
Thank you so very much.

32:54.218 --> 32:56.884
If we release him,
and it is a lie,

32:57.470 --> 32:59.493
we look like fools.

33:00.486 --> 33:01.674
I can't play liar's poker

33:01.762 --> 33:03.119
with hundreds of lives
on the line.

33:03.206 --> 33:06.924
Even if there is a 99.9%
chance that he is bluffing?

33:07.012 --> 33:10.079
Look, I have seen a situation
like this before.

33:10.208 --> 33:12.207
Alabama, 2012.

33:12.329 --> 33:14.899
Oh, the white supremacist
bombing at the Baptist church.

33:15.076 --> 33:16.837
Just like this,
the chief of police

33:16.925 --> 33:19.501
thought the threat was a hoax,
and they never notified us.

33:19.589 --> 33:21.129
I remember.
I remember.

33:21.217 --> 33:22.900
You were on that response team.

33:22.988 --> 33:23.939
Yeah.

33:24.027 --> 33:26.150
We recovered the remains
of nine dead parishioners

33:26.238 --> 33:29.181
from that church,
including three children.

33:29.708 --> 33:31.289
I can still picture the sight.

33:31.377 --> 33:33.876
Bodies of children
being carried out.

33:34.527 --> 33:37.634
So unless a bomb dog alerts
before the exchange opens,

33:37.976 --> 33:40.954
Kenneth Bates
is getting on that plane.

33:43.100 --> 33:45.454
At least run it
by the director.

33:45.794 --> 33:47.306
See where he stands.

33:47.433 --> 33:49.993
I did.
He said it was my call.

33:50.181 --> 33:52.298
He doesn't want
his fingerprints on this.

33:52.386 --> 33:54.619
Look, he knows
it can end very badly

33:54.707 --> 33:56.267
no matter
what choice I make.

34:05.166 --> 34:06.595
We've got a logistical
nightmare

34:06.683 --> 34:09.003
if we have to evacuate this
place before the bell goes off.

34:09.251 --> 34:10.580
Yeah, go for Maggie.

34:10.797 --> 34:12.132
Are they running the dogs?

34:12.235 --> 34:13.588
<i>Yes, no hits yet.</i>

34:20.639 --> 34:22.554
Tell Jubal
to put him on that plane.

34:28.023 --> 34:29.219
Yeah, I think you're gonna
have to run it

34:29.306 --> 34:32.083
- through that database again, all right?
- Jubal. - Yeah?

34:32.516 --> 34:33.806
It's time.

34:33.987 --> 34:35.710
Isobel wants to put Sentinel
on the plane.

34:35.797 --> 34:37.485
For God's sake,
he's bluffing.

34:37.574 --> 34:38.695
She's our boss.

34:38.783 --> 34:39.981
It's not our job
to second guess her.

34:40.068 --> 34:41.277
Yeah, I know.

34:44.889 --> 34:47.462
But it is our job
to protect her.

34:51.306 --> 34:53.297
Know what?
Grab his personal effects.

34:53.386 --> 34:54.985
Meet me in the JOC.

34:56.688 --> 34:58.119
Okay.

34:58.553 --> 34:59.638
Yeah.

35:19.712 --> 35:21.126
Why, thank you.

35:21.221 --> 35:22.626
Mm,
on't mention it.

35:33.072 --> 35:36.618
Did you really think
we'd believe you?

35:37.837 --> 35:39.197
I don't bluff.

35:40.428 --> 35:42.389
And by the way...

35:44.301 --> 35:46.304
Ticktock, time's a wasting.

35:46.392 --> 35:48.460
Teterboro... it's, like,
an hour away, right?

35:48.548 --> 35:53.697
So, let's see.
That means you only have...

36:10.458 --> 36:11.800
Is there a problem?

36:12.925 --> 36:14.228
What is this?

36:14.379 --> 36:18.017
This is...
this is a joke, right?

36:18.105 --> 36:21.506
No, no, it's 9:29.

36:21.594 --> 36:23.468
I thought we could watch
the opening bell together.

36:23.555 --> 36:24.610
You did say the bomb
would go off

36:24.697 --> 36:26.673
right when it rang, right?

36:27.428 --> 36:30.553
<i>Well, what we consider
are surefire bets these days...</i>

36:30.687 --> 36:33.525
<i>Well, common knowledge used to
be the tech and energy sectors</i>

36:33.613 --> 36:35.606
<i>but some market analysts
caution</i>

36:35.725 --> 36:37.529
<i>that these areas are too
rapidly evolving</i>

36:37.628 --> 36:40.544
<i>to effectively work
as our so-called "safe bets."</i>

36:40.647 --> 36:42.542
<i>The volatility across
global markets...</i>

36:42.690 --> 36:44.230
This is a live feed.

36:44.581 --> 36:46.115
We've got a front row seat.

36:46.202 --> 36:48.048
The anticipation
is killing me.

36:48.136 --> 36:49.244
How 'bout you?

36:51.317 --> 36:54.066
<i>...401K, an IRA,
or other standard investment.</i>

36:54.169 --> 36:56.751
<i>One tech expert was recently
quoted saying</i>

36:56.838 --> 36:59.170
<i>that she thought cell phones
might be a thing of the past.</i>

36:59.258 --> 37:00.563
<i>In the next couple of decades.</i>

37:13.236 --> 37:14.632
Well, what do you know.

37:16.020 --> 37:20.226
Looks like the only thing
that blew up... is your story.

37:22.363 --> 37:24.023
You miss...

37:25.992 --> 37:29.015
100% of the shots
you don't take, right?

37:30.789 --> 37:34.211
You gotta admit that was... that
was a pretty good shot, right?

37:35.736 --> 37:37.735
I came pretty close, didn't I?

37:39.992 --> 37:42.025
Well, I wouldn't be
too hard on yourself.

37:42.249 --> 37:45.275
You were kind of
ahead of your skis on this one

37:45.363 --> 37:47.728
the whole time,
weren't you?

37:56.871 --> 38:00.635
Hey, so we just confirmed

38:00.723 --> 38:01.783
Bates was lying.

38:01.871 --> 38:03.387
There is no bomb.

38:03.754 --> 38:04.918
How?

38:05.020 --> 38:07.045
He just watched
the opening bell ring,

38:07.133 --> 38:08.593
and nothing blew up.

38:10.036 --> 38:11.465
What are you talking about?

38:11.553 --> 38:13.260
The exchange doesn't open
for another two hours.

38:13.347 --> 38:15.972
Well, it opened
a little early today.

38:16.125 --> 38:18.754
I learned a lot about
deepfake video manipulation

38:18.842 --> 38:20.043
from watching
that museum footage.

38:20.130 --> 38:23.152
Plus I wound his fancy watch
forward two hours.

38:25.856 --> 38:27.738
You guys did this
without telling me.

38:28.304 --> 38:32.180
We took a shot
because we knew you were

38:32.268 --> 38:35.460
in a difficult situation,
and if he didn't buy it,

38:35.603 --> 38:37.520
we still had time
to put him on the plane.

38:41.151 --> 38:42.613
Thank you.

38:43.244 --> 38:44.613
Both of you.

38:45.273 --> 38:48.081
I am gonna go
notify the director.

38:55.408 --> 38:56.596
You are a rock star.

38:56.684 --> 38:58.034
Ah, thank you.

38:58.122 --> 38:59.854
Which is why

39:00.587 --> 39:03.557
I need to keep you
in the JOC for a while.

39:04.287 --> 39:05.448
For a while?

39:05.536 --> 39:08.527
I'm... I'm getting medical
release for field work

39:08.615 --> 39:09.807
in less than two weeks.

39:09.918 --> 39:14.502
No, I know, but...
working with you these last few days

39:14.590 --> 39:17.042
has reminded me how much
we need you in here.

39:17.759 --> 39:19.173
How much I need you.

39:22.279 --> 39:26.667
Okay, um, well,
how... how long?

39:27.193 --> 39:30.096
Not sure.
See how it goes.

39:32.612 --> 39:34.202
- Okay.
- Hm.

39:34.290 --> 39:35.792
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

39:36.331 --> 39:37.753
Good.

39:49.387 --> 39:51.213
- Hey.
- Hey.

39:53.723 --> 39:55.346
Did you mention to Jubal

39:55.434 --> 39:57.010
that I should be
back in the JOC?

39:57.278 --> 39:59.026
- What?
- No.

39:59.394 --> 40:00.487
Why would I do that?

40:00.575 --> 40:03.729
Oh, I know you saw me
in my car the other day.

40:09.835 --> 40:12.612
It's just... I can do this,
you know?

40:12.700 --> 40:14.768
I'm not scared to be
back out in the field.

40:15.123 --> 40:16.458
I hear you.

40:19.135 --> 40:20.729
Look, we're not invincible.

40:23.541 --> 40:27.120
I just want you
to take the time to heal.

40:27.516 --> 40:29.276
Not just physically.

40:31.018 --> 40:33.620
And when the time is right,
you'll be back out there.

40:34.445 --> 40:37.799
Okay, but what if everything
and everyone moves on?

40:38.277 --> 40:41.385
Mm-hmm, some things
probably will.

40:42.636 --> 40:45.315
But that does not mean
that you aren't needed.

40:48.493 --> 40:49.823
I hope you're right.
