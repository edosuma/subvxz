I guess I told them
what they wanted to hear.

Spence, they're in
the fuckin' house.

02:18.224 --> 02:20.099
The fuck you talkin' about?
Who's in the house?

02:20.183 --> 02:21.516
Suits from the NCAA.

02:21.600 --> 02:23.892
They're talking
to my mom right now.

02:23.974 --> 02:26.558
Fuck. All right, Q,
listen to me--

02:26.642 --> 02:28.141
Why would they
show up here, Spencer?

02:28.224 --> 02:29.642
Fuck, man.

02:29.725 --> 02:30.933
They're poking around,

02:31.016 --> 02:32.266
asking questions
about you.

02:32.350 --> 02:33.642
Is this your idea
of handling it?

02:33.725 --> 02:35.183
It's OK. You didn't
do anything wrong.

02:35.266 --> 02:37.099
No shit!
What am I supposed to do?

02:37.183 --> 02:39.141
Go out there right now
and ask them leave

02:39.224 --> 02:41.308
as politely as possible,
and let me handle it.

02:41.391 --> 02:43.433
I feel like
I've heard this
before, Unc.

02:43.516 --> 02:45.974
This does not feel
fucking handled.

02:46.058 --> 02:47.850
I'm gonna hop on a plane
as soon as we got off
this phone

02:47.933 --> 02:50.058
and find out
what the hell's going on.

02:50.141 --> 02:52.266
It's Ohio State, man.
I shoulda never
messed with them.

02:52.350 --> 02:54.433
I should have just gone
and did what they wanted me to.

02:54.516 --> 02:55.933
You don't owe them
a fuckin' thing, OK?

02:56.016 --> 02:57.850
This is your life.
Do you hear me?

02:57.933 --> 02:58.892
Yeah.

02:58.974 --> 03:00.808
Now, you wanna be a Buckeye?

03:00.892 --> 03:03.350
Go right ahead.

03:03.433 --> 03:05.850
Or we can keep going together,
me and you.

03:05.933 --> 03:08.475
We already gone
this far, right?

03:08.558 --> 03:10.558
That's right.

03:10.642 --> 03:11.933
Family, right?

03:14.642 --> 03:16.099
Family.

03:17.767 --> 03:20.183
- He's out, Charles.
- But he deleted the tweet!

03:20.266 --> 03:22.642
In this climate, we can't afford
any more distractions.

03:22.725 --> 03:25.850
We've already got
that goddamn kneeling nightmare
that never goes away.

03:25.933 --> 03:28.099
I don't really see it
as a nightmare, sir.

03:28.183 --> 03:29.850
'Cause it's not your money.

03:29.933 --> 03:33.183
Look, just give me
a couple of days
to fix this thing.

03:33.266 --> 03:34.974
I really believe
we can spin it in our favor.

03:35.058 --> 03:38.058
The internet never forgets,
and the public never forgives.

03:38.141 --> 03:39.350
We need Ricky.

03:39.433 --> 03:41.016
And he really needs us
right now.

03:41.099 --> 03:43.808
- ( sighs )
- Just two days?

03:48.642 --> 03:49.767
All right!

03:49.850 --> 03:52.516
I'm gonna make you
look smart.

03:52.600 --> 03:54.683
"-ter." I'm gonna make you
look smarter.

03:54.767 --> 03:57.433
Charles, get out
of my office.

03:57.516 --> 03:59.266
Joe:
So, before

03:59.350 --> 04:01.600
the meeting,
the kids were feeling a little,

04:01.683 --> 04:03.683
I dunno, peckish?

04:03.767 --> 04:06.933
So stupidly,
I pulled over
at a taco truck,

04:07.016 --> 04:11.224
which was really, like,
peddling leftovers out of
the back of a Nissan--

04:11.308 --> 04:13.058
Let me save you
the energy, Joe.

04:13.141 --> 04:16.433
It's a soft pass,
but not the for the reason
you might think.

04:16.516 --> 04:19.808
- Oh, come on, Yanni.
- It was a decently
clever stunt, Joe,

04:19.892 --> 04:22.725
but you think I'm shocked
to see dumb kids act
like dumb kids?

04:22.808 --> 04:24.642
- Let me talk them--
- They're cool, man,

04:24.725 --> 04:26.516
but they're an amusement,
they're not a brand.

04:26.600 --> 04:29.350
Maybe in a couple of years
they'll hone in on their thing,

04:29.433 --> 04:32.892
but for now they're just
a disposable Insta-story.

04:32.974 --> 04:34.391
No. You're wrong.

04:34.475 --> 04:36.058
With all due respect,
you're wrong.

04:36.141 --> 04:37.475
These kids
have something special.

04:37.558 --> 04:39.558
They have
an authentic edge

04:39.642 --> 04:43.099
that other companies
are gonna shell out big for.

04:43.183 --> 04:46.600
OK, then prove me wrong, Joe.
Make me the dummy.

04:46.683 --> 04:49.350
I'm not gonna make you
the dummy, Yanni.

04:49.433 --> 04:51.516
I'm gonna make you rich.

04:51.600 --> 04:53.600
Julian, everything
is under control.

04:53.683 --> 04:54.725
Julian:
This is under control?

04:54.808 --> 04:56.266
Spencer:
Yes, it is.

04:56.350 --> 04:58.141
I'm strolling through my house
hooked up to an IV,

04:58.224 --> 05:00.183
and my sutures
are starting to itch.

05:00.266 --> 05:02.600
- Everything's under control?
- It will be.

05:02.683 --> 05:04.308
This is just a minor glitch.

05:04.391 --> 05:06.725
You said that
everything was worked out,
that the kid was in the bag.

05:06.808 --> 05:09.600
He was until Ohio State
started acting like
a bunch of bitches.

05:09.683 --> 05:11.308
It's OK,
they don't have anything.

05:11.391 --> 05:13.808
This is the NCAA, Spencer,
it's not a court of law.

05:13.892 --> 05:15.892
They can do anything
they fuckin' want.

05:15.974 --> 05:19.099
And if they think
you're sticking your shiny
bullet head up their ass,

05:19.183 --> 05:21.183
- they're gonna come down hard.
- So let 'em.

05:21.266 --> 05:22.516
Do I have to remind you

05:22.600 --> 05:24.350
how much I sank
into these rights

05:24.433 --> 05:25.808
thanks to your sure thing?

05:25.892 --> 05:27.850
You assured me that
it was totally kosher.

05:27.933 --> 05:29.558
There's nothing illegal
about our buy.

05:29.642 --> 05:31.683
Plus, they'd have to stretch
to link the kid.

05:31.767 --> 05:34.433
Wait, link the kid?
Link the kid?!

05:34.516 --> 05:36.683
Are you telling me
that he's involved?

05:36.767 --> 05:39.642
Do not  fucking tell me
that he's involved.

05:39.725 --> 05:41.974
No, of course not.

05:42.058 --> 05:45.016
All right, listen to me.
USC is threatening

05:45.099 --> 05:47.016
to pull out of this deal,
Spencer.

05:47.099 --> 05:50.600
And if I was not in danger
of losing an obscene

05:50.683 --> 05:54.099
amount of money--
and I loathe  losing money,
do you hear me?

05:54.183 --> 05:57.933
I loathe it,
I would just as soon
lose a testicle--

05:58.016 --> 05:59.850
I would beat them to the punch.

05:59.933 --> 06:02.475
Now get your shit together.

06:02.558 --> 06:03.850
I just landed in Indy.

06:03.933 --> 06:05.516
I'm handling it
as we speak.

06:05.600 --> 06:07.683
I hope so,
because you'd hate

06:07.767 --> 06:09.974
how I'd handle it.

06:10.058 --> 06:11.433
Morphine!

06:13.600 --> 06:16.850
I hope Jason was gentle
with y'all on that deal.

06:16.933 --> 06:19.516
"Gentle" isn't exactly
the word I'd use
to describe him,

06:19.600 --> 06:21.266
but you know
how he does.

06:23.475 --> 06:26.099
California!
Nothin' like it.

06:27.767 --> 06:29.683
What are we doing
out here?

06:29.767 --> 06:31.974
Checkin' out your fly view?

06:37.516 --> 06:40.099
You know, my mom,

06:40.183 --> 06:44.391
she used to put trash bags
on the windows...

06:44.475 --> 06:47.016
so the landlord
wouldn't know we were there.

06:47.099 --> 06:50.099
Used to get hot as hell
in there, too.

06:50.183 --> 06:53.391
In the summertime
it was boiling.

06:53.475 --> 06:55.516
I remember the smell.

06:57.808 --> 07:00.725
Kinda like
cookin' plastic?

07:00.808 --> 07:05.266
I thought that shit was normal
for the longest time.

07:05.350 --> 07:08.558
For what it's worth,
I didn't know that cereal
wasn't a dinner food

07:08.642 --> 07:10.808
until about high school.

07:15.016 --> 07:16.475
Look at all this, Chuck.

07:16.558 --> 07:18.933
Look at what you got.

07:19.016 --> 07:23.141
What we earned.
And we earned that shit, Chuck.

07:23.224 --> 07:26.350
People out there hatin'
on us speaking out.

07:27.683 --> 07:31.391
Like we should be grateful
that we making millions.

07:32.433 --> 07:35.183
( laughs )
Like we ain't?

07:37.350 --> 07:39.350
Like they don't complain
about their lives or jobs.

07:39.433 --> 07:42.433
Bullshit. And we can't
complain about injustice?

07:42.516 --> 07:45.725
And these same people...

07:45.808 --> 07:49.266
actin' like they just
gave us this shit.

07:49.350 --> 07:53.308
Like my dreams, life,
house, were just given
to my black ass.

07:53.391 --> 07:56.642
And my talent,
my hard fuckin'
work and savvy,

07:56.725 --> 07:59.516
ain't have shit
to do with it.

07:59.600 --> 08:02.350
- That shit ain't right.
- No, it ain't right.

08:02.433 --> 08:05.224
But this tweet, Rick.

08:05.308 --> 08:07.642
Man, you really got
people riled up this time.

08:07.725 --> 08:10.642
I'm gettin' pressure
from my higher-ups
to make some kind of--

08:10.725 --> 08:12.725
That tweet wasn't even
about white people.

08:12.808 --> 08:16.016
It was about my neighbors,
it's their names.
The Whites.

08:16.099 --> 08:17.308
Ohh.

08:17.391 --> 08:18.974
I'm gonna straighten that out,
though,

08:19.058 --> 08:21.642
'cause they cool as hell,
lovely people. Really.

08:21.725 --> 08:24.767
But more importantly,
I want to have the freedom
to say what I want to say, man.

08:24.850 --> 08:29.308
Not just for me,
but for our children, man.
For our kids.

08:29.391 --> 08:32.974
I wanna play for a team
that ain't gonna try
to muzzle me.

08:33.058 --> 08:36.558
Well, you can do that,
you just gotta finesse it
in a way--

08:36.642 --> 08:39.683
- Where the white folks approve.
- No, that your bosses
approve of, fool.

08:39.767 --> 08:42.016
- Right.
- Regardless of their color.

08:42.099 --> 08:44.600
Everybody out here
just trying to get
his paper, right?

08:44.683 --> 08:46.350
Everybody's
about the green?

08:46.433 --> 08:48.099
Don't try me like that.

08:48.183 --> 08:50.600
I don't believe that,
and neither do you.

08:52.141 --> 08:54.433
Look...

08:54.516 --> 08:57.433
do what you gotta do,
man. I understand, yo.

08:58.558 --> 09:00.516
Fine me, whatever.
I get it.

09:00.600 --> 09:04.183
But know that when
you're lookin' at your life

09:04.266 --> 09:06.099
and the man you  want to be,

09:06.183 --> 09:08.558
ask yourself the question--

09:10.600 --> 09:13.099
what are we doing out here?

09:18.016 --> 09:20.933
♪ Big L, rest in peace,
rest in peace ♪

09:23.433 --> 09:25.224
♪ Uh uh uh uh uh ♪

09:25.308 --> 09:27.808
( song continues )

09:34.558 --> 09:36.141
Man:
Mr. Strasmore.

09:36.224 --> 09:37.308
They're ready for you.

09:38.725 --> 09:41.016
I don't think they are.

09:44.308 --> 09:48.516
Mr. Strasmore,
we can do some small talk
off the top here,

09:48.600 --> 09:51.683
keep it polite,
if that would make you
feel more comfortable.

09:51.767 --> 09:53.183
No, Robert, it's OK.

09:53.266 --> 09:55.141
That would be out of my league
'cause you guys

09:55.224 --> 09:57.850
have become very rich men
by saying bunch of shit
that you don't mean.

09:57.933 --> 10:00.266
So why don't we just
get the show on the road.

10:00.350 --> 10:02.600
What's your relationship
with Quincy Crawford?

10:02.683 --> 10:06.266
- How do you mean?
- Your relationship
to him is what?

10:06.350 --> 10:08.433
You want us to arrange it
a few more ways?

10:08.516 --> 10:11.683
It'll mean the same thing,
Spencer, so answer the question.

10:11.767 --> 10:14.974
Quincy's mother
and I are pursuing
a romantic relationship,

10:15.058 --> 10:17.016
so I guess that would
make me a family friend.

10:17.099 --> 10:19.308
- With benefits.
- Yeah, if you want

10:19.391 --> 10:22.350
to think about it
like a teenager would.
Friend with benefits.

10:22.433 --> 10:26.308
And how do
these benefits extend
to the young Mr. Crawford?

10:26.391 --> 10:29.600
Well, Q, from time to time,
will ask me for my advice,

10:29.683 --> 10:33.391
and it's advice
that I feel I am uniquely
qualified to offer him

10:33.475 --> 10:35.933
- What's the nature
of this "advice"?
- Specifically,

10:36.016 --> 10:39.224
it's just to make sure
that he is not exploited
and fucked over

10:39.308 --> 10:41.974
by a bunch of rich white guys
who don't give a shit about him.

10:43.308 --> 10:45.475
You really want to play
the race card, Spencer?

10:45.558 --> 10:48.016
Yeah, why not, Robert?
Because I find it
really interesting

10:48.099 --> 10:51.892
that the only pro sports
that require these athletes
to pass through your clutches

10:51.974 --> 10:53.475
are the ones that
are mostly made up

10:53.558 --> 10:55.099
of kids of color
to begin with.

10:55.183 --> 10:57.600
You mean football
and basketball.

10:57.683 --> 11:00.141
No, I'm talking about
curling and fuckin' badminton.

11:00.224 --> 11:04.808
( laughs ) That's a lot
of righteous rage, Spencer.

11:04.892 --> 11:06.141
Yeah, it is.

11:06.224 --> 11:08.558
Does this moral outrage
of yours

11:08.642 --> 11:10.600
extend to television
network deals?

11:10.683 --> 11:13.808
Taking recruiting visits
with high school students?

11:13.892 --> 11:15.808
Aren't you a registered
financial manager?

11:15.892 --> 11:17.600
We understand your good pals
the Anderson brothers

11:17.683 --> 11:20.642
have just secured
the USC broadcasting rights,

11:20.725 --> 11:24.266
and in addition to committing
a number of NCAA violations,

11:24.350 --> 11:26.683
I'm sure you've broken
some NFL rules.

11:26.767 --> 11:29.308
And God only knows
what you tell your client.

11:29.391 --> 11:32.141
- Quincy is not my client.
- Is that what
you tell yourself?

11:32.224 --> 11:35.224
I'm gonna stop you right there.
This is a corrupt organization

11:35.308 --> 11:37.016
that has been rotting
from the inside out

11:37.099 --> 11:38.725
for decades now,
and you know it.

11:38.808 --> 11:40.850
And the public is finally
beginning to catch up,

11:40.933 --> 11:42.808
but they don't even know
half the truth

11:42.892 --> 11:46.558
about how you guys chew up
thousands and thousands
of kids every single year

11:46.642 --> 11:48.099
under the promise
of an education,

11:48.183 --> 11:50.308
then you squeeze out
every bit of value
that they have

11:50.391 --> 11:51.974
before you pass 'em on
to the pros.

11:52.058 --> 11:54.642
Or you just discard them
as if they got no value at all.

11:54.725 --> 11:56.808
And God forbid
they get hurt.

11:56.892 --> 11:58.516
You know how I know this?

11:58.600 --> 12:02.183
Because I saw it,
and because I lived it.

12:02.266 --> 12:03.558
Robert, look at me.

12:03.642 --> 12:05.516
I know where all
the dead bodies are buried.

12:05.600 --> 12:07.433
Unless you want me
digging them up

12:07.516 --> 12:09.933
and dragging them
in front of the ESPN cameras
that you guys love so much,

12:10.016 --> 12:11.767
here's what you're gonna do:

12:11.850 --> 12:14.308
you're gonna stay the fuck
away from me and anyone
who I care about.

12:14.391 --> 12:16.350
Let me tell you motherfuckers
something else.

12:16.433 --> 12:18.350
The next time that you
bring me to this shithole,

12:18.433 --> 12:20.725
it better be
to offer me a deal
and a huge check,

12:20.808 --> 12:23.099
because you're wasting
my valuable fucking time!

12:28.391 --> 12:30.892
Come on. Come on. Come on.

12:30.974 --> 12:32.725
Pass the ball.

12:32.808 --> 12:36.224
- ( whistle blows )
- Pass-- Ohh. Arrghh!

12:36.308 --> 12:38.558
Yo, man, can't you
turn that shit off
for a second?

12:38.642 --> 12:40.224
Joe, what the fuck
am I doing here?

12:40.308 --> 12:41.850
You're pulling me
off the poker table

12:41.933 --> 12:43.725
so we can watch Vernon
play FIFA?

12:43.808 --> 12:44.808
Vernon:
Chill, y'all.

12:44.892 --> 12:46.433
This is sophisticated gaming.

12:46.516 --> 12:47.974
This shit requires precision,

12:48.058 --> 12:50.433
fast-twitch muscles,
and hand-eye coordination.

12:50.516 --> 12:53.266
How 'bout I hand-eye coordinate
my fist to your fuckin' face?

12:53.350 --> 12:55.183
Guys, guys, guys, guys,

12:55.266 --> 12:57.016
no one wants to be here
less than I do.

12:57.099 --> 12:59.224
That isn't true.
We're happy to be here

12:59.308 --> 13:02.350
'cause we want to invite you
in on the process.

13:02.433 --> 13:04.058
Process of what?

13:04.141 --> 13:06.850
The process of raising
the profile of Sports X

13:06.933 --> 13:08.266
and its young phenoms.

13:08.350 --> 13:09.683
So you need my money

13:09.767 --> 13:11.183
and you need me
to market your shit.

13:11.266 --> 13:13.892
I wouldn't put it that way,
exactly,

13:13.974 --> 13:15.933
but yeah, yeah,
we need a little help.

13:16.016 --> 13:18.224
This is gonna be fun as fuck!
For real!

13:18.308 --> 13:20.475
You remember back
in eighth grade
how we used to do

13:20.558 --> 13:22.850
the backyard wrestling thing
over at Dale's grandmother's?

13:22.933 --> 13:26.141
Oh, yeah! Didn't you
get a wiffle ball bat
stuck up your ass?

13:26.224 --> 13:27.767
This isn't the point.

13:27.850 --> 13:31.016
The point is, look, man,
we want to take that energy

13:31.099 --> 13:33.516
with a little side project
we think is gonna help

13:33.600 --> 13:35.183
take this company
to the next level.

13:35.266 --> 13:37.475
And we're giving you guys
the chance to become

13:37.558 --> 13:39.350
more than just
the silent partners
you've been.

13:39.433 --> 13:40.892
Oh, we gotta act, too?

13:40.974 --> 13:42.892
- Yeah.
- OK. Well, motherfucker,
this is me

13:42.974 --> 13:45.016
acting like I don't want
to fuckin' kill you.

13:45.099 --> 13:48.058
- How am I doing?
- Yeah, got it.

13:49.516 --> 13:51.558
What the fuck
y'all want us to do?

I guess you guys think
your little stunt
the other day

14:20.767 --> 14:22.933
really blew some
corporate minds, huh?

14:23.016 --> 14:25.058
We were just fuckin' with 'em
to see if they could hang.

14:25.141 --> 14:27.350
Just like with y'all.

14:27.433 --> 14:28.850
Well, it worked.

14:28.933 --> 14:30.516
What?!

14:30.600 --> 14:32.892
He's still interesting
in spite of your little prank.

14:32.974 --> 14:36.099
I don't know why.
Probably because  of it,
to tell you the truth.

14:36.183 --> 14:39.266
But do you want
to know what he said?
I don't think you do.

14:43.600 --> 14:45.850
He said that you guys
are nothing special.

14:45.933 --> 14:48.516
He said that
you're not shit.

14:48.600 --> 14:50.516
Just some hood rats.

14:50.600 --> 14:53.350
- Man, fuck that.
- Reggie: Fuck that?

14:53.433 --> 14:55.725
- Fuck that.
- Fuck that.

14:55.808 --> 14:57.224
You think they're wrong?
Why?

14:57.308 --> 14:58.558
'Cause we own our own shit.

14:58.642 --> 15:01.308
Or own plane,
our own track.

15:01.391 --> 15:04.600
They can get with it,
or whatever like that.

15:04.683 --> 15:07.266
This is the thing right here.
This is what I was
talkin' about.

15:07.350 --> 15:09.183
There is a massive disconnect

15:09.266 --> 15:12.558
between what it is
you guys think you're doing

15:12.642 --> 15:14.892
and what you're actually
fucking doing.

15:14.974 --> 15:17.974
'Cause what you're actually
doing is fuckin' off.

15:18.058 --> 15:21.475
- Fuckin' off.
- With a little talent
and a little vibe.

15:21.558 --> 15:24.391
But you still ain't shit.
Despite all that,

15:24.475 --> 15:26.433
we're gonna give you a shot,
all right?

15:26.516 --> 15:30.058
We stole some very,
very expensive cameras,

15:30.141 --> 15:32.767
and you guys
are gonna take them

15:32.850 --> 15:37.266
and show us what it is
you want the world to see.

15:37.350 --> 15:40.099
This is Sizzle,
this is Vernon.

15:40.183 --> 15:41.808
Some big, bad motherfuckers.

15:41.892 --> 15:45.099
With short attention spans
and severe anger issues.

15:45.183 --> 15:47.600
Reggie: They gonna
roll with y'all.

15:47.683 --> 15:49.974
OK, but what is it
that you want us to do?

15:50.058 --> 15:51.475
Hurt yourself.

15:51.558 --> 15:53.974
Don't come back until
you've broken your jaw

15:54.058 --> 15:55.600
or busted your
fuckin' femur.

15:55.683 --> 15:58.516
I wanna see your fuckin' bone
through your skin.

15:58.600 --> 16:01.475
You little fuckers in,
or what?

16:03.892 --> 16:08.183
So, ya know,
I couldn't tell Ricky today.

16:08.266 --> 16:09.974
I was gonna,

16:10.058 --> 16:13.767
but he just got
crazy real with me

16:13.850 --> 16:15.266
and I just couldn't.

16:15.350 --> 16:16.600
He'll understand.

16:16.683 --> 16:18.308
Now, I know you and Ricky
are friends,

16:18.391 --> 16:20.391
but he always makes
business-first decisions.

16:20.475 --> 16:22.850
Remember that time
you were out begging
with your hand out

16:22.933 --> 16:25.183
for his new contract
and he stuck his nose up at it?

16:25.266 --> 16:27.850
This is different.

16:27.933 --> 16:30.475
There's something happening
in the league.

16:30.558 --> 16:33.224
In sports.
In the country.

16:35.058 --> 16:39.224
When Kiki gets older
and she looks back
on this movement,

16:39.308 --> 16:41.892
what is she gonna think
about her daddy?

16:41.974 --> 16:44.433
Oh, baby.
She's gonna think

16:44.516 --> 16:47.475
that he did
everything he could
to make her life better.

16:47.558 --> 16:48.933
Better how, though?

16:49.016 --> 16:50.683
Like "Gucci hoops" better?

16:50.767 --> 16:53.558
Or "she didn't get killed
during a traffic stop" better?

16:55.558 --> 16:59.350
Listen... I love you.

16:59.433 --> 17:02.266
Do what you need to do.

17:06.642 --> 17:10.141
( cell phone chimes )

17:10.224 --> 17:11.808
Spence: Joe,
why you blowing me up?

17:11.892 --> 17:13.600
Tell me this isn't happening,
Spencer.

17:13.683 --> 17:16.099
- What's not happening?
- I just got off the phone

17:16.183 --> 17:18.141
with a couple of heavily
medicated Andersons,

17:18.224 --> 17:20.642
- and they had
a lot to say, man.
- Are they being irrational?

17:20.725 --> 17:22.850
I think the better question is,
are you being rational?

17:22.933 --> 17:26.099
Your golden goose just
got himself grounded
by the NCAA.

17:26.183 --> 17:28.016
You're talking
about the Q thing.

17:28.099 --> 17:29.350
It's a little bit more
than a thing.

17:29.433 --> 17:31.266
They're ruling Quincy
ineligible.

17:31.350 --> 17:34.183
The Andersons
are losing their minds
over this rights issue.

17:34.266 --> 17:37.224
- Fuckin' NCAA!
- What did you do, Spencer?

17:37.308 --> 17:40.974
Please, please don't tell me
that you decided to take on

17:41.058 --> 17:44.974
one of the most corrupt
and powerful organizations
in all of sports.

17:47.183 --> 17:48.350
I did.

17:48.433 --> 17:49.683
( sighs )

17:53.141 --> 17:54.600
Fuck you.

17:54.683 --> 17:56.516
I knew they were gonna
bite back, I just didn't think--

17:56.600 --> 17:58.308
You didn't care
who they bit.

17:59.767 --> 18:01.683
Look, I'm on my way
to see Q right now,

18:01.767 --> 18:03.558
I'm gonna make sure that
they do not take him down.

18:03.642 --> 18:06.516
I'm also gonna make sure
that the brothers
don't take Sports X.

18:06.600 --> 18:09.974
- Vivian Ramirez.
- What? Who's that?

18:10.058 --> 18:14.725
Vivian Ramirez
is the head of housekeeping
here at Sports X.

18:14.808 --> 18:19.433
She has not missed a day
in over three years.

18:19.516 --> 18:22.974
She supports two families,
one here, one in Ecuador.

18:23.058 --> 18:25.224
She stayed on with us

18:25.308 --> 18:27.892
because she values loyalty
more than anything else,

18:27.974 --> 18:30.558
and she said that
you have a face
that she could trust.

18:30.642 --> 18:33.099
Are you gonna guilt-trip me
right now, Joe?

18:33.183 --> 18:35.308
No. I'm trying to give you
a dose of reality

18:35.391 --> 18:38.266
that there are real people
involved here besides yourself.

18:38.350 --> 18:40.391
Did you think about Vivian

18:40.475 --> 18:42.600
when you decided
to gamble her livelihood

18:42.683 --> 18:44.099
on this absurd scam?

18:44.183 --> 18:46.391
Did you think about her
or me or Q

18:46.475 --> 18:48.683
or anyone besides yourself?

18:51.516 --> 18:52.767
All right. Joe,

18:52.850 --> 18:54.433
I give you my word.

18:54.516 --> 18:56.141
I'm gonna take care
of everything for you,

18:56.224 --> 18:59.433
for Q, and especially
for Vivian.

18:59.516 --> 19:01.016
Yeah. Great.

19:01.099 --> 19:04.224
Because your word
means everything  these days.

19:09.725 --> 19:11.058
( sighs )

19:11.141 --> 19:12.391

you haven't been lying
and hustling me
behind my fucking back.

19:43.391 --> 19:46.099
- Just give me a minute, OK?
- You messed with Q's future!

19:46.183 --> 19:48.974
- How fucked up are you?
- This is what the NCAA
wants us to do.

19:49.058 --> 19:51.850
They want us to fall apart
so they can swoop in
and be the heroes!

19:51.933 --> 19:54.433
And you can't stand that,
because you  gotta play
the fuckin' hero.

I just want

19:58.642 --> 20:00.850
You don't care about anybody
but your fucking self!

20:00.933 --> 20:03.308
He told me. Everything.

20:03.391 --> 20:05.058
Q told me everything.

20:06.933 --> 20:09.892
See, unlike you,
he has integrity.

20:09.974 --> 20:11.558
He doesn't lie
to people he cares about.

20:11.642 --> 20:13.266
I was offering him a way
to buck the system

20:13.350 --> 20:15.350
so he could get paid
his actual value

20:15.433 --> 20:17.600
and not get used
by these greedy fuckin'
old white dudes

20:17.683 --> 20:19.350
who don't give
a shit about him!

20:19.433 --> 20:21.974
Mm-hmm, 'cause you had
nothing to gain from it, right?

20:22.058 --> 20:23.808
I did, yes, I-- we did!

20:23.892 --> 20:25.600
Come on,
I'm crazy about you both!

20:25.683 --> 20:27.141
You're worse than them.

20:27.224 --> 20:28.308
Don't say that.

20:28.391 --> 20:29.892
At least they're up front.

20:29.974 --> 20:31.391
"Here are the rules,
here's who we are."

20:31.475 --> 20:32.808
That's not true,
they're fuckin' snakes!

20:32.892 --> 20:34.767
No, you're the fuckin'
snake, Spencer.

20:34.850 --> 20:38.016
It was you all along.
It was you.

20:38.099 --> 20:40.224
Stay away from my family.

20:40.308 --> 20:42.266
And enjoy your slice,
you earned it.

20:42.350 --> 20:43.974
Jayda.

20:44.058 --> 20:45.308
Jayda!

20:46.516 --> 20:48.099

20:51.141 --> 20:52.725
- That moment.

20:52.808 --> 20:55.558

20:58.642 --> 21:00.850
...when you feel
their weight on you.

21:00.933 --> 21:04.308
Your body just goes numb
trying to protect you

21:24.183 --> 21:29.141

21:31.058 --> 21:33.974
Where pain... becomes pride.

21:40.308 --> 21:43.016

21:43.099 --> 21:45.600
Now, that's a comeback.

21:45.683 --> 21:47.642
( applause )

21:58.475 --> 21:59.974
- ( sighs )
- Hey.

22:00.058 --> 22:01.224
Make this quick, Charles.

22:01.308 --> 22:02.892
I've got that twit
from Papa John's,

22:02.974 --> 22:05.308
and a hornet's nest
of shareholders

22:05.391 --> 22:06.933
are gonna plow through
this afternoon,

22:07.016 --> 22:08.350
so come on, let's go.

22:08.433 --> 22:10.350
I'll be brief.
It's about Ricky Jarret.

22:10.433 --> 22:11.558
Went that bad, huh?

22:11.642 --> 22:13.475
No,
actually it went great.

22:13.558 --> 22:15.808
- Really?
- Yeah!

22:15.892 --> 22:17.850
Yeah, we're not
gonna cut him.

22:19.391 --> 22:21.016
That's a joke, right?

22:21.099 --> 22:23.183
No. And not only
are we gonna keep him,

22:23.266 --> 22:24.600
but we're gonna back him

22:24.683 --> 22:26.808
and his right to speak up
for his beliefs.

22:26.892 --> 22:29.808
Charles, you know that
this is a business,  right?

22:29.892 --> 22:31.266
It's not a not-for-profit.

22:31.350 --> 22:33.099
Yeah.

22:34.725 --> 22:36.933
Where's the new stadium again?

22:39.892 --> 22:42.600
- Inglewood.
- And who lives in Inglewood?

22:43.808 --> 22:46.767
- People.
- Black people.

22:46.850 --> 22:49.058
Black people live in Inglewood.
It's OK, you can say it.

22:49.141 --> 22:50.892
- Yeah.
- And those same people

22:50.974 --> 22:54.391
would probably love
to see the team that
represents them on the field

22:54.475 --> 22:56.224
represent them
in their real lives.

22:56.308 --> 22:59.516
Great. Maybe we can get
the Black Panthers
to sponsor us.

22:59.600 --> 23:00.892
Come on, Charles.

23:00.974 --> 23:03.141
We should be so lucky.

23:03.224 --> 23:05.683
There's a tide happening
in this country, sir,

23:05.767 --> 23:07.350
and we can either
ride on top of it

23:07.433 --> 23:09.266
or get swept up under it.

23:09.350 --> 23:10.642
This is L.A.!

23:10.725 --> 23:12.433
This city has been
at the center

23:12.516 --> 23:15.391
of the struggle
for equal rights
since the sixties.

23:15.475 --> 23:18.892
I'm not saying
that we have to endorse
everything that Ricky

23:18.974 --> 23:20.558
or any of the other players
are saying politically--

23:20.642 --> 23:23.558
Charles,
what are  you saying?

23:23.642 --> 23:25.558
We set up
a team-sponsored fund

23:25.642 --> 23:29.099
that fights social inequality
and injustice right here
in Los Angeles,

23:29.183 --> 23:31.058
and we make Ricky
the face of the whole thing.

23:31.141 --> 23:33.475
But what about the pissed-off
football fans, Charles?

23:33.558 --> 23:34.974
Fuck 'em.

23:36.308 --> 23:38.391
- Fuck 'em.
- Respectfully, sir.

23:38.475 --> 23:40.266
You're gonna fuck 'em
respectfully?

23:40.350 --> 23:42.475
You want this team
to have an identity?

23:42.558 --> 23:44.350
You want 'em
to have a soul?

23:44.433 --> 23:45.850
Then this is where it starts.

23:45.933 --> 23:49.224
We have to win over our city,
our fans.

23:49.308 --> 23:51.391
I promise you,
this is important to them.

23:51.475 --> 23:55.475
Maybe even as important
as winning. Maybe even more.

23:55.558 --> 23:59.058
So it's not only good business,
it's what's right.

24:03.558 --> 24:05.016
OK, Charles.

24:06.183 --> 24:07.600
OK.

24:07.683 --> 24:10.141
But if this blows up
in any way,

24:10.224 --> 24:12.391
you're the one that's
gonna go down for it.

24:12.475 --> 24:13.683
You understand that?

24:15.016 --> 24:16.850
- I do.
- Good.

24:20.642 --> 24:22.933
It's impressive, Charles.

24:23.016 --> 24:25.141
Your commitment
and your passion--

24:25.224 --> 24:26.642
very impressive.

24:26.725 --> 24:28.266

25:31.892 --> 25:33.933
I'm just here
to apologize to you.

25:35.391 --> 25:37.391
Man, fuck your apology.

25:38.433 --> 25:39.933
I trusted you.

25:40.016 --> 25:42.600
My mother trusted you.

25:42.683 --> 25:45.516
I can't even play for
a fuckin' community college now.

25:45.600 --> 25:48.224
It's not only
about you, Q.

25:48.308 --> 25:50.892
You said you would handle it.
Then I hear from Ohio State

25:50.974 --> 25:53.308
that you're in there
swinging your dick around.

25:53.391 --> 25:55.224
- How was that handling it?
- It's not.

25:55.308 --> 25:58.099
Yeah, no shit.
This whole thing
was about you.

25:58.183 --> 25:59.974
It's not.
It's about my brother.

26:00.058 --> 26:01.683
I don't want to hear
about your brother, man.
I'm walkin'.

26:01.767 --> 26:03.933
Took his own life, Q.

26:06.767 --> 26:09.391
Junior year, he tore up
his shoulder in practice,
he was never the same.

26:09.475 --> 26:14.224
He couldn't play that year,
they didn't give him back
his year of eligibility.

26:14.308 --> 26:16.308
He just spiraled
out of control.

26:16.391 --> 26:18.016
I could never get him
back in the boat.

26:18.099 --> 26:21.558
If  that's true,
that's some sad shit,

26:21.642 --> 26:23.600
but it has nothing
to do with me.

26:23.683 --> 26:26.516
And it doesn't explain
your shitty behavior.

26:26.600 --> 26:27.808
No, it doesn't.

26:28.808 --> 26:29.808
It doesn't.

26:31.558 --> 26:34.266
But I want you to know
I never forgave the NCAA
for how they treated him,

26:34.350 --> 26:37.016
how they left him out
on his own.

26:37.099 --> 26:39.892
And it blinded me.

26:39.974 --> 26:41.558
And I'm sorry.

26:41.642 --> 26:45.475
I came here to tell you
face to face, man to man...

26:45.558 --> 26:47.099
that I fucked up.

26:47.183 --> 26:48.892
Yeah, you fucked up.

26:48.974 --> 26:52.767
And as much as it kills me
to say this...

26:52.850 --> 26:55.141
I'm gonna leave you
and your mother alone.

27:05.224 --> 27:07.558

you're gonna
kill it there, kid.

Spencer Strasmore

29:27.141 --> 29:30.308
is single-handedly changing

What side of history do you guys
want to be on?

29:33.725 --> 29:35.767

than all of us.

29:36.433 --> 29:38.183

personal for you.

29:38.683 --> 29:40.850
It is.
We're talking about family.

29:41.808 --> 29:44.099
What is this? An intervention?
I mean, who are y'all?

29:44.183 --> 29:44.974
Your family.

29:47.266 --> 29:49.099

29:49.475 --> 29:50.974
I've never been afraid
of a fight.

29:51.350 --> 29:52.725

29:57.266 --> 29:58.350
