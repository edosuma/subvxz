WEBVTT

00:12.067 --> 00:13.833
PREVIOUSLY
ON "GREY'S ANATOMY"...

00:13.867 --> 00:16.633
ALEX, PLEASE TELL ME THAT YOU
DON'T LIVE WITH MEREDITH GREY.

00:16.667 --> 00:19.567
THE MORE AVAILABLE HE GETS,
THE MORE I PULL AWAY.
I'M USED TO BEING NUMBER ONE.

00:19.600 --> 00:23.500
I WILL HELP YOU.
WE'LL BE LIKE A TEAM.

00:23.533 --> 00:25.533
DR. HAHN HAS AGREED TO BECOME
OUR NEW HEAD

00:25.567 --> 00:28.167
OF CARDIOTHORACIC SURGERY.
LOOKIN' FORWARD TO IT,
DR. YANG.

00:28.200 --> 00:29.400
AH, GOOD MORNING.

00:29.433 --> 00:31.800
TROUT FOR BREAKFAST...
AGAIN.

00:31.833 --> 00:36.567
TONIGHT WE WILL HAVE
HOT, PERFECT SEX.

00:36.600 --> 00:40.667
(cries) I'M EXHAUSTED.
MAYBE TONIGHT'S
NOT THE PERFECT NIGHT.

00:41.667 --> 00:45.333
***

00:48.200 --> 00:50.167
***

00:50.200 --> 00:52.100
(Meredith)
BEFORE WE WERE DOCTORS,

00:52.133 --> 00:53.267
WE WERE MED STUDENTS.

00:53.300 --> 00:56.167
WHICH MEANT WE SPENT A LOT
OF TIME STUDYING CHEMISTRY.

00:56.200 --> 00:57.733
WOW.

00:57.767 --> 00:59.567
YEAH. (chuckles)

00:59.600 --> 01:01.500
THAT WAS--

01:01.533 --> 01:03.067
AEROBIC.

01:03.100 --> 01:05.433
AEROBIC BAD?

01:05.467 --> 01:08.533
NO, NO. WHY, DO YOU THINK
IT WAS BAD?

01:08.567 --> 01:10.267
NO.
OKAY.

01:10.300 --> 01:12.500
NO, I MEAN, OBVIOUSLY
WE BOTH WERE NERVOUS.

01:12.533 --> 01:14.433
WELL, YEAH,
WE'VE BEEN, UH,

01:14.467 --> 01:16.367
YOU KNOW,
WAITING FOR SO LONG.

01:16.400 --> 01:18.300
IT WAS LIKE...
IT BETTER BE GOOD.

01:18.333 --> 01:20.233
YEAH. NO, BETTER BE WORTH IT.
YOU KNOW? (laughs)

01:20.267 --> 01:22.233
(laughs)
THAT'S A LOT OF PRESSURE.

01:22.267 --> 01:23.600
YEAH.

01:23.633 --> 01:26.467
LET'S JUST DO IT AGAIN.

01:26.500 --> 01:29.433
YEAH, LET'S GET RIGHT BACK
ON THAT HORSE.
YEAH.

01:29.467 --> 01:31.733
ORGANIC CHEMISTRY,
BIOCHEMISTRY--

01:31.767 --> 01:33.267
WE LEARNED IT ALL.

01:33.300 --> 01:35.467
WHAT'S NEW WITH YOU?

01:35.500 --> 01:37.400
I SAW MY HALF SISTER
HALF NAKED.

01:37.433 --> 01:38.833
OH.

01:38.867 --> 01:40.633
WHAT'S NEW WITH YOU?

01:40.667 --> 01:42.567
I HAD DINNER AND A MOVIE...

01:42.600 --> 01:43.800
WITH THE CHIEF.

01:43.833 --> 01:46.533
MM.

01:46.567 --> 01:47.667
HEY...

01:47.700 --> 01:49.767
YOU COULD STAY.

01:49.800 --> 01:51.800
YEAH, I THINK I'M GONNA GO.

01:51.833 --> 01:53.733
LEAVE YOU WANTING MORE
AND ALL OF THAT.

01:53.767 --> 01:56.567
BUT WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT
HUMAN CHEMISTRY,

01:56.600 --> 01:59.033
ONLY ONE THING MATTERS...

01:59.067 --> 02:02.167
***

02:02.200 --> 02:04.067
EITHER YOU'VE GOT IT...

02:04.100 --> 02:06.067
OR YOU DON'T.

02:06.100 --> 02:10.767
***

02:10.800 --> 02:12.467
DRY CLEANING.

02:12.500 --> 02:14.733
YEAH.
YOU WANT SOME COFFEE?

02:14.767 --> 02:16.667
AND TELL THEM
THAT THERE IS A STAIN

02:16.700 --> 02:18.600
ON THE LEFT SLEEVE
OF THE BLUE ONE.

02:18.633 --> 02:21.400
I'M THINKING
"GODFATHER" TONIGHT.

02:21.433 --> 02:23.467
SOUNDS GOOD.

02:23.500 --> 02:25.400
(imitates Marlon Brando
as Don Vito Corleone) I'M GONNA

02:25.433 --> 02:27.667
MAKE 'EM AN OFFER
THEY CAN'T REFUSE.

02:27.700 --> 02:29.367
(normal voice)
THAT'S BRANDO.

02:29.400 --> 02:31.700
(laughs) YEAH. GOT THAT.

02:31.733 --> 02:33.300
(mouths word)

02:36.700 --> 02:39.567
HEY, I'M TAKING MEREDITH GREY
FROM YOU THIS WEEK.

02:39.600 --> 02:41.500
HER MOTHER
WAS A GOOD SURGEON,

02:41.533 --> 02:43.733
AND I WANT TO SEE
WHAT SHE'S LIKE.

02:43.767 --> 02:45.667
WELL, THAT'S NOT
HOW IT WORKS HERE.

02:45.700 --> 02:47.833
YOU GET ASSIGNED A RESIDENT.
THERE'S A SCHEDULE.

02:47.867 --> 02:49.000
(scoffs) WELL, THE SCHEDULE

02:49.033 --> 02:52.100
DOESN'T TAKE INTO ACCOUNT
CERTAIN THINGS.
LIKE WHAT?

02:52.133 --> 02:54.033
LIKE THE FACT
THAT I DON'T WANT YANG.

02:54.067 --> 02:55.567
YOU CAN HAVE STEVENS.

02:55.600 --> 02:59.633
SHE'S GOOD, AND I'M SURE
SHEPHERD WON'T MIND.

02:59.667 --> 03:01.067
WON'T MIND WHAT?

03:01.100 --> 03:02.767
OH, SHE'S SASSY.

03:02.800 --> 03:04.467
SHE'S A WOMAN OF SUBSTANCE.

03:04.500 --> 03:06.400
YOU TWO
HAVE NOTHING IN COMMON.

03:06.433 --> 03:09.300
OH, I'M LATE. I HAD TO DROP OFF
THE CHIEF'S DRY CLEANING.

03:09.333 --> 03:10.500
YOU'RE DOING HIS LAUNDRY?

03:10.533 --> 03:12.200
WE'RE HELPING
EACH OTHER OUT.

03:12.233 --> 03:13.400
YEAH? WHAT'S HE DOING?

03:13.433 --> 03:15.533
HE HAS AN EXTENSIVE
DVD COLLECTION.

03:17.233 --> 03:18.767
YOU'RE DATING THE CHIEF.

03:18.800 --> 03:20.700
(chuckles)

03:23.700 --> 03:25.600
I DON'T CARE
IF YOU SLEEP WITH LEXIE.

03:25.633 --> 03:28.467
OH, I JUST CAN'T DO IT
AT MY HOUSE.
IT'S MY HOUSE.

03:28.500 --> 03:31.367
OH, GET OVER IT. IT WAS
A ONETIME THING ANYWAY.
ALEX.

03:31.400 --> 03:32.733
WHAT?
SERIOUSLY, ONE TIME.

03:32.767 --> 03:35.633
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM WITH YOU
AND YOUR SISTER ANYWAY?

03:35.667 --> 03:38.067
SHE'S NOT MY SISTER.

03:38.100 --> 03:39.100
HEY.

03:39.133 --> 03:40.467
YOU LOOK WEIRD.

03:40.500 --> 03:41.833
I DON'T LOOK WEIRD.

03:41.867 --> 03:43.367
WHAT'S WRONG?

03:43.400 --> 03:45.600
I LOOK FINE.
I KNOW YOU.

03:45.633 --> 03:48.067
IT'S HORRIBLE--
THE SEX...

03:48.100 --> 03:50.567
WITH IZZIE--

03:50.600 --> 03:52.567
HORRIBLE.

03:52.600 --> 03:54.567
IT'S LIKE SHE'S TRYING
TOO HARD.

03:54.600 --> 03:56.567
IT'S--IT'S--
YOU EVER SEE A PORNO?

03:56.600 --> 03:59.200
NOT THAT IZZIE'S A PORNO.
SHE'S AN ANGEL.

03:59.233 --> 04:02.100
BUT IT'S LIKE SHE'S TRYING
TO CHANNEL A PORN STAR.

04:02.133 --> 04:04.267
AND SHE'S TRYING TO ACT
ALL DIRTY AND SEXY,

04:04.300 --> 04:05.800
WHICH SOUNDS GREAT, RIGHT?

04:05.833 --> 04:07.800
BUT IN REALITY,
I JUST WANT TO SAY,

04:07.833 --> 04:10.167
"IZZIE, JUST 'CAUSE YOU CAN
DO THAT WITH YOUR LEGS

04:10.200 --> 04:12.400
DOESN'T MEAN
THAT YOU SHOULD."

04:12.433 --> 04:14.600
AH.

04:16.533 --> 04:18.167
I WANT TO RUN.

04:18.200 --> 04:20.733
RUN. RUN. RUN NOW.

04:22.400 --> 04:23.467
OH!

04:23.500 --> 04:25.800
(sighs)
I LOVE GEORGE.

04:25.833 --> 04:27.700
OH, GOD.
I DO. I LOVE HIM.

04:27.733 --> 04:29.633
AND I'M SO HAPPY
BECAUSE HE'S KIND

04:29.667 --> 04:32.767
AND SMART AND, UM,
SWEET AND SEXY.

04:32.800 --> 04:34.700
HE'S PERFECT. PERFECT.

04:34.733 --> 04:37.133
EXCEPT FOR THE FACT
THAT HE KISSES LIKE A CHICKEN.

04:37.167 --> 04:38.833
YOU KNOW, A CHICKEN
PECKING THE GROUND FOR FOOD,

04:38.867 --> 04:40.500
JUST PECKING AND PECKING
AND PECKING?

04:40.533 --> 04:42.433
AND WHEN HE'S PECKING AT ME
LIKE THAT,

04:42.467 --> 04:44.667
I FORGET THAT I LOVE HIM.
I FORGET THAT HE'S KIND

04:44.700 --> 04:46.333
AND--AND SWEET AND SEXY,

04:46.367 --> 04:48.333
AND I JUST WANT TO SCREAM,
"STOP PECKING ME!"

04:48.367 --> 04:51.300
DID HE PECK YOU
LIKE A CHICKEN, MER?
MORNING.

04:51.333 --> 04:54.400
CRISTINA NEEDS ME.
I'M PAINTING
BURKE'S APARTMENT

04:54.433 --> 04:57.733
SO I CAN STOP CALLING IT
"BURKE'S APARTMENT"--

04:57.767 --> 04:59.500
A HAPPY COLOR--
RED, LIKE BLOOD.

04:59.533 --> 05:02.633
PLUS, I AM ON CARDIO
THIS WHOLE WEEK--

05:02.667 --> 05:03.700
ONE OF THE BENEFITS

05:03.733 --> 05:06.600
OF LIVING WITH THE PERSON
WHO MAKES THE SCHEDULE.

05:06.633 --> 05:09.367
I'M ON POST-OP AGAIN.

05:09.400 --> 05:11.500
SECOND WEEK IN A ROW.
TRADE WITH ME.

05:11.533 --> 05:14.333
OH, YEAH. NO WAY.
I WAS TALKING TO MEREDITH.

05:14.367 --> 05:16.333
WHY? I'M WITH HAHN.

05:16.367 --> 05:19.233
DUDE, WAKE UP AND SMELL
THE SURGICAL BOARD.

05:19.267 --> 05:22.133
3 DAYS AGO, THERE WAS
A CODE IN ROOM 2037

05:22.167 --> 05:24.067
AND NO RESIDENT TO COVER IT.
I-I--

05:24.100 --> 05:26.600
THE SCHEDULE IS A MESS,
YOUR MESS.

05:26.633 --> 05:29.467
CLEAN IT UP.

05:29.500 --> 05:31.567
CHIEF HAD ON
HIS STERN FACE.

05:31.600 --> 05:33.367
YEAH, YOU KNOW, I WAS--

05:33.400 --> 05:35.633
I WAS HAPPY THIS MORNING.
YOU KNOW WHY?

05:35.667 --> 05:39.167
BECAUSE I HAVE
BACK-TO-BACK SURGERIES TODAY.

05:39.200 --> 05:42.133
YOU HAVE ON
YOUR I-WANT-SOMETHING FACE.

05:42.167 --> 05:44.567
WILL YOU COVER FOR ME,
JUST DO THE CHIEF RESIDENT THING

05:44.600 --> 05:46.500
SO I CAN STAY HAPPY?

05:46.533 --> 05:48.600
JUST TODAY.
PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE.

05:48.633 --> 05:51.300
SO YOU WANT ME TO--
BE ME.
BUT, YOU KNOW, BETTER.

05:51.333 --> 05:52.567
BE YOU.

05:56.233 --> 05:57.433
HOW'S IT GOING, JERRY?

05:57.467 --> 05:59.433
IF BY "HOW'S IT GOING,"
YOU'RE ASKING ME

05:59.467 --> 06:01.100
IF I'VE HAD THE PLEASURE

06:01.133 --> 06:03.033
OF TAKING A CRAP YET,
DR. KAREV,

06:03.067 --> 06:04.800
THE ANSWER IS
IT'S NOT GOING.

06:04.833 --> 06:05.867
NOTHING'S GOING.
NOTHING'S MOVING.

06:05.900 --> 06:08.267
IT'S BEEN FIVE DAYS
SINCE YOUR BOWEL RESECTION.

06:08.300 --> 06:10.733
YOU SHOULD BE--
CRAPPING BY NOW?

06:10.767 --> 06:13.167
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM? DID YOU
PEOPLE BOTCH THE SURGERY?

06:13.200 --> 06:15.467
IS THERE CRAP LEAKING OUT
INTO MY BODY?

06:15.500 --> 06:17.567
THE SURGERY WAS A SUCCESS--

06:17.600 --> 06:19.233
LISTEN, DR. KAREV--

06:19.267 --> 06:21.367
OH, MAMA!

06:21.400 --> 06:24.267
I'VE BEEN DIVORCED TWICE.
MY CHILDREN WON'T TALK TO ME.

06:24.300 --> 06:27.467
I'VE BATTLED ADDICTIONS,
FILED FOR BANKRUPTCY.

06:27.500 --> 06:29.600
MY LIFE HAS BASICALLY SUCKED.

06:29.633 --> 06:30.833
BUT THROUGH IT ALL,

06:30.867 --> 06:32.767
THE ONE THING
I HAD GOING FOR ME

06:32.800 --> 06:34.800
WAS I CRAP LIKE CLOCKWORK.

06:34.833 --> 06:37.433
IT'S A SIMPLE PLEASURE.
I WANT IT BACK.

06:37.467 --> 06:39.367
SO GET YOUR
LITTLE PRESCRIPTION PAD

06:39.400 --> 06:43.500
AND WRITE ME A PRESCRIPTION
TO MAKE ME CRAP.

06:46.167 --> 06:48.500
GREY AND HAHN?

06:48.533 --> 06:50.433
HEY, SHE CAN'T DO THIS.

06:50.467 --> 06:53.067
SHE CAN'T JUST NOT TEACH ME.
IT'S HER JOB.

06:53.100 --> 06:55.067
TORRES HAS TO MAKE HER
TEACH ME.

06:55.100 --> 06:56.300
IF THE CHEMISTRY
ISN'T THERE--

06:56.333 --> 06:58.233
IT'S NOT CHEMISTRY.
SHE DOESN'T LIKE ME.

06:58.267 --> 07:00.167
SHE SAYS IT'S CHEMISTRY.

07:00.200 --> 07:01.533
NO, I'M GOING TO TORRES.

07:01.567 --> 07:03.367
UH, DR. TORRES...

07:03.400 --> 07:06.233
WANTED ME TO TELL YOU...

07:06.267 --> 07:07.733
TO FIND ANOTHER SPECIALTY.

07:07.767 --> 07:09.267
W-WHY?

07:09.300 --> 07:11.200
IT'S NOT GONNA WORK
WITH HAHN.

07:11.233 --> 07:12.767
SO YOU NEED TO FIND

07:12.800 --> 07:14.700
A WAY TO MAKE IT WORK
WITH ANOTHER SPECIALTY.

07:14.733 --> 07:16.833
I SUGGEST YOU TRY THE E.R.

07:16.867 --> 07:19.333
WHAT?
THIS ISN'T A REQUEST.

07:19.367 --> 07:23.033
THIS IS AN ORDER
FROM YOUR CHIEF RESIDENT.

07:23.067 --> 07:24.800
THE E.R. CAN BE A CANDY STORE.

07:24.833 --> 07:26.733
YOU'VE GOT CAR CRASHES,
IMPALEMENTS.

07:26.767 --> 07:28.433
WHAT DO YOU GOT?

07:28.467 --> 07:30.600
SPRAINED ANKLE
AND AN INFECTED BUNION.

07:30.633 --> 07:33.500
IT CAN ALSO STRIP YOU
OF YOUR WILL TO LIVE.

07:33.533 --> 07:36.567
OKAY, GO, TROLL,
FIND ME SOMETHING GOOD.

07:36.600 --> 07:39.100
DR. YANG.
YEAH.

07:39.133 --> 07:41.067
HAS MEREDITH SAID ANYTHING
TO YOU ABOUT ME?

07:41.100 --> 07:43.733
'CAUSE SHE'S BEEN AVOIDING ME
FOR DAYS.
YOU KNOW,
WHAT DID I SAY TO YOU

07:43.767 --> 07:46.767
ABOUT TALKING TO ME
ABOUT YOUR PERSONAL LIFE?
HELP! MY--MY BABY.

07:46.800 --> 07:48.833
I-I WAS CARRYING HER
DOWN THE STAIRS AND I FELL,

07:48.867 --> 07:50.633
AND SHE HIT HER HEAD.
SHE WAS CRYING IN THE CAR,

07:50.667 --> 07:52.767
AND NOW
SHE'S NOT CRYING ANYMORE.
(woman) MA'AM.

07:52.800 --> 07:56.100
I'M TOO SCARED TO LOOK. SOMEONE
PLEASE TELL ME MY BABY'S ALIVE.

07:56.133 --> 07:58.033
OKAY, LET ME HAVE THE BABY--
SHE CAN'T BE DEAD, RIGHT?

07:58.067 --> 08:00.333
YOU DON'T DIE FROM JUST
FALLING DOWN THE STAIRS.

08:00.367 --> 08:02.700
SHE'S--
PLEASE, LET ME HELP.
LET ME HELP.

08:02.733 --> 08:05.233
I'LL TAKE THE BABY.
THAT'S FINE. OKAY.
OH, MY GOD. (crying)

08:05.267 --> 08:07.400
(woman) OH, MY GOD.

08:08.867 --> 08:10.667
SHE'S BREATHING.

08:10.700 --> 08:13.167
HER FONTANELLE FEELS TENSE.
SHE'S LETHARGIC.

08:13.200 --> 08:15.500
TAKE HER TO TRAUMA TWO
AND PAGE SHEPHERD.

08:15.533 --> 08:17.300
THANK YOU.
YOU'RE WELCOME.

08:17.333 --> 08:19.133
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
THANK YOU.
OKAY.

08:19.167 --> 08:21.067
OKAY, MA'AM, UM, YOU CAN, UH,
STOP HUGGING ME

08:21.100 --> 08:23.300
SO I CAN TAKE CARE
OF YOUR BABY.

08:23.333 --> 08:26.133
MA'AM. MA'AM?

08:26.167 --> 08:29.667
MA'AM?

08:29.700 --> 08:32.033
(Cristina) I'M NOT GETTING
A HEARTBEAT. NO PULSE.

08:32.067 --> 08:34.767
GET ME A CRASH CART.
SHE'S NOT BREATHING.

08:34.800 --> 08:36.500
(siren wails)

08:37.667 --> 08:42.333
(monitor beeping erratically)

08:43.767 --> 08:44.667
DR. YANG?

08:44.700 --> 08:46.500
TERESA BROTHERTON,
LOST VITALS AND CODED.

08:46.533 --> 08:49.033
I NEEDLED A TENSION PNEUMO
ON THE RIGHT SIDE.

08:49.067 --> 08:51.567
SHE REGAINED VITALS.
SHE'S GOT SO MUCH AIR
IN THE SOFT TISSUES,

08:51.600 --> 08:53.167
IT'S OBSCURING THE ULTRASOUND.

08:53.200 --> 08:56.100
PROBABLY PUNCTURED AN AIRWAY
AS WELL AS HER LUNG. FEEL THAT?

08:56.133 --> 08:58.067
UH, I WAS TALKING TO GREY.

08:58.100 --> 09:00.367
WE'VE GOT IT FROM HERE,
DR. YANG.

09:04.600 --> 09:08.533
(Erica) CALL C.T.
TELL THEM WE'RE ON OUR WAY.

09:08.567 --> 09:10.533
AND YOU DIDN'T SEE HIM
SWALLOW IT?
YOU WERE MAKING
YOUR COLLAGES

09:10.567 --> 09:12.333
WHILE OUR SON
QUIETLY CHOKED TO DEATH?

09:12.367 --> 09:13.700
IT WAS ONE MARBLE.

09:13.733 --> 09:15.667
BRIAN, HONEY, TELL YOUR DAD
YOU'RE NOT DEAD.

09:15.700 --> 09:18.133
THEN ASK YOUR MOM
WHAT THE HELL COLLAGE ART IS.

09:18.167 --> 09:20.333
MAYBE IF YOU CAME
TO MY STUDIO SOMETIME,

09:20.367 --> 09:24.200
YOU COULD SEE FOR YOURSELF.
OKAY, LOOK, I'M TOO BUSY
WORKING TO PAY FOR THAT STUDIO--

09:24.233 --> 09:26.200
OKAY, MOM, DAD,
JUST SHUT UP, OKAY?

09:26.233 --> 09:29.200
(sighs) SORRY. THEY'RE ANNOYING.
(man) BRIAN, THAT'S RUDE.

09:29.233 --> 09:31.500
I WONDER
WHERE HE GETS THAT FROM.

09:31.533 --> 09:34.733
WELL, THERE'S NOT MUCH WE CAN DO
EXCEPT WAIT FOR IT TO PASS.
SO HE'S FINE?

09:34.767 --> 09:38.167
IT WAS ONE MARBLE.
HE'S NOT CHOKING OR DROOLING.

09:38.200 --> 09:39.367
HE'LL BE FINE.

09:39.400 --> 09:41.233
BUT I STILL GET SOMETHING,
RIGHT?

09:41.267 --> 09:44.033
YOU SAID AFTER WE WENT
TO THE HOSPITAL,

09:44.067 --> 09:46.800
I'D GET WHATEVER I WANTED.
ABSOLUTELY, SWEETIE.
YOU WERE REALLY BRAVE.

09:46.833 --> 09:48.733
(man) YEAH, BUDDY,
ANYTHING YOU WANT.

09:48.767 --> 09:52.067
OKAY. I WANT YOU GUYS
TO GET A DIVORCE.

09:53.533 --> 09:55.533
HOW ABOUT A PUPPY?

09:55.567 --> 09:58.067
NO, DON.
WHAT? A BOY SHOULD HAVE
A PUPPY.

09:58.100 --> 09:59.567
WE TALKED ABOUT THIS EARLIER.
I KNOW WE TALKED ABOUT IT,
BUT LOOK, THE KID--

09:59.600 --> 10:01.333
WE'LL INFILTRATE

10:01.367 --> 10:04.200
WITH A MIXTURE OF BUPIVACAINE

10:04.233 --> 10:06.600
THEN LIDO WITH EPI
ALONG THESE AREAS HERE.

10:06.633 --> 10:09.733
(sighs) IS THERE A SURGERY
THAT CAN MAKE ME LOOK LIKE HER?

10:09.767 --> 10:11.667
YOU'RE MUCH PRETTIER
THAN DR. STEVENS.

10:11.700 --> 10:13.633
THEN HOW COME
I CAN'T EVEN REMEMBER

10:13.667 --> 10:15.533
THE LAST TIME I HAD SEX?

10:15.567 --> 10:17.467
I'LL BET DR. STEVENS
CAN REMEMBER

10:17.500 --> 10:19.633
THE LAST TIME SHE HAD SEX.
HARRIET, DON'T HARASS
THE RESIDENTS.

10:19.667 --> 10:21.567
SHE'S YOUNG.
SHE STILL HAS HER LOOKS.

10:21.600 --> 10:23.800
ALTHOUGH, SWEETIE, YOU'RE
ALREADY GETTING WORRY LINES.

10:23.833 --> 10:26.300
WHAT DO YOU POSSIBLY HAVE
TO BE WORRIED ABOUT?

10:26.333 --> 10:28.200
NOTHING. I-I DON'T HAVE
WORRY LINES.

10:28.233 --> 10:30.833
OH, OH, YOUR FROWN LINE
IS ALREADY PROMINENT.

10:30.867 --> 10:33.167
WHATEVER IS WRONG IN YOUR LIFE,
YOU NEED TO FIX IT QUICK.

10:33.200 --> 10:34.800
BECAUSE ONCE THIS STUFF STARTS
TO TURN SOUTH, HONEY,

10:34.833 --> 10:36.733
IT IS A LONG WAY BACK.
TRUST ME.

10:36.767 --> 10:39.300
KNOW WHAT THIS IS?

10:39.333 --> 10:41.567
LOOKS LIKE
MULTIPLE RIB FRACTURES

10:41.600 --> 10:43.100
AND A MASSIVE HEMOTHORAX.

10:43.133 --> 10:45.033
ACTUALLY, IT'S YOU
GIVING UP O.R. TWO.

10:45.067 --> 10:46.400
MY PATIENT IS EMERGENT.

10:46.433 --> 10:48.600
WHAT DO I TELL MY PATIENT?

10:48.633 --> 10:51.733
IF IT WERE ME, I'D TELL HER
TO AGE GRACEFULLY.

10:51.767 --> 10:53.700
(chuckles)

10:55.233 --> 10:58.133
YOUR BABY HAS
A SLIGHT BRAIN CONTUSION.

10:58.167 --> 10:59.700
HER BRAIN'S BRUISED.
IT'S MINOR.

10:59.733 --> 11:01.633
BUT I'D LIKE TO KEEP HER HERE
FOR OBSERVATION.

11:01.667 --> 11:03.633
I-I GOTTA TELL YOU,
DR. SHEPHERD,

11:03.667 --> 11:05.033
I'M LISTENING TO YOU,

11:05.067 --> 11:07.500
BUT I'M NOT HEARING
ANYTHING YOU'RE SAYING.

11:07.533 --> 11:10.433
DR. HAHN IS TAKING MY WIFE
INTO SURGERY RIGHT NOW,

11:10.467 --> 11:12.367
AND I NEED TO GO BE WITH HER.

11:12.400 --> 11:14.633
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING.
G-GO AHEAD AND DO IT.

11:14.667 --> 11:18.133
I NEED TO GO BE WITH MY WIFE.

11:18.167 --> 11:21.067
WAIT. UM,
WHAT'S YOUR DAUGHTER'S NAME?

11:21.100 --> 11:23.433
SHE DOESN'T HAVE ONE YET.

11:23.467 --> 11:26.033
WE JUST ADOPTED HER
A WEEK AGO,

11:26.067 --> 11:29.733
JUST BEEN TRYING
TO GET TO KNOW HER.

11:31.267 --> 11:33.100
(monitor emitting
continuous tone)

11:33.133 --> 11:34.433
(Erica) CLEAR.

11:34.467 --> 11:36.333
(paddles thump)

11:36.367 --> 11:38.433
(buzzing)
CLEAR.

11:38.467 --> 11:40.167
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

11:40.200 --> 11:42.600
PUSH THE INTRACARDIAC EPI.

11:42.633 --> 11:45.833
GET READY TO CROSS-CLAMP
THE AORTA.

11:45.867 --> 11:48.667
(Meredith) THE HEART'S
RESPONDING. SINUS RHYTHM.

11:48.700 --> 11:51.633
ALL RIGHT, THAT'S TWICE IN
TWO HOURS THIS WOMAN HAS DIED.

11:51.667 --> 11:53.467
LET'S PICK UP THE PACE,
EVERYONE.

11:53.500 --> 11:56.367
THE LESS TIME SHE'S
ON THE TABLE, THE BETTER.

11:56.400 --> 11:58.467
QUITE A RUSH, HUH?

12:00.867 --> 12:02.733
HAHN TOOK MY O.R.

12:02.767 --> 12:04.567
SHE'S PUSHY.

12:06.333 --> 12:08.333
PUSHY AND RUDE.

12:08.367 --> 12:11.667
IS SHE DOING
A STAPLED TRACTOTOMY?

12:11.700 --> 12:15.467
YEAH. SHE'S TRYING TO SAVE
AS MUCH LUNG TISSUE AS POSSIBLE.

12:16.733 --> 12:19.200
DOESN'T MAKE UP
FOR PUSHY AND RUDE.

12:20.533 --> 12:24.033
NO, IT DOESN'T.

12:28.467 --> 12:30.133
YOU PAGED ME?

12:30.167 --> 12:32.567
YEAH, UM, I WAS WONDERING,

12:32.600 --> 12:34.500
DO YOU THINK
I COULD PICK HER UP?

12:34.533 --> 12:36.033
THE BABY?

12:36.067 --> 12:38.367
I MEAN, THE FATHER HASN'T
REALLY BEEN DOWN HERE,

12:38.400 --> 12:40.300
AND SHE'S BEEN THROUGH
SO MUCH ALREADY.

12:40.333 --> 12:41.667
(baby cries)

12:41.700 --> 12:44.467
THAT'S NOT WHY
YOU PAGED ME.
IT'S NOT?

12:44.500 --> 12:46.367
NO. YOU PAGED ME
BECAUSE YOUR LEGS

12:46.400 --> 12:48.367
ARE STILL SHAKING
FROM THE OTHER NIGHT,

12:48.400 --> 12:50.433
AND YOU'RE TRYING
TO WORK UP THE NERVE

12:50.467 --> 12:53.500
TO INVITE ME TO A FRIENDLY,
NEIGHBORHOOD ON CALL ROOM.

12:53.533 --> 12:56.400
ACTUALLY, I PAGED YOU
BECAUSE I WANTED TO KNOW

12:56.433 --> 12:58.333
IF YOU COULD
PLEASE TELL MEREDITH

12:58.367 --> 13:01.100
THAT I HAD NO IDEA
THAT HER HOUSE WAS YOUR HOUSE.

13:01.133 --> 13:03.600
I MEAN, SHE AND I W--
WE WERE MAKING PROGRESS,

13:03.633 --> 13:06.500
AND--AND NOW SHE MUST THINK
THAT I'M A STALKER.

13:06.533 --> 13:09.400
SORRY. UH, YOUR ISSUES
CAN'T BE MY ISSUES.

13:09.433 --> 13:12.267
BUT I AM HERE FOR THE SEX
IF YOU NEED IT.

13:12.300 --> 13:13.767
IF I NEED IT?

13:13.800 --> 13:16.633
YOU KNOW YOU NEED IT.

13:16.667 --> 13:19.167
(scoffs)

13:19.200 --> 13:21.367
HAVE YOU SEEN DR. TORRES?

13:21.400 --> 13:23.033
SHE PROMISED ME
A BREAKDOWN

13:23.067 --> 13:24.267
FOR NEXT WEEK'S
E.N.T. CONFERENCE

13:24.300 --> 13:26.667
BY THE END OF THE DAY.

13:26.700 --> 13:29.100
UH, SHE ASKED ME
TO PASS IT ALONG.

13:29.133 --> 13:31.067
MUST HAVE SLIPPED MY MIND.
MY APOLOGIES.

13:31.100 --> 13:33.667
OH, GOOD. I MEAN...
THIS IS GOOD.

13:33.700 --> 13:36.333
THIS IS... NICE WORK.

13:36.367 --> 13:38.333
THANK YOU. I MEAN, YEAH.

13:45.133 --> 13:46.700
AH!
(thud)

13:46.733 --> 13:48.733
OOH. SORRY. I'M SORRY.

13:48.767 --> 13:50.667
OH, NO, IT'S FINE.
IT'S JUST--

13:50.700 --> 13:52.233
OKAY.
IT'S JUST...

13:52.267 --> 13:53.567
OW! OW.
SORRY.

13:53.600 --> 13:55.500
YOU GO THAT WAY. I GO...

13:55.533 --> 13:58.033
YOU KNOW, WE... (chuckles)
WE SHOULD--

13:58.067 --> 14:00.233
WE SHOULD...
STOP FOR A SEC.

14:00.267 --> 14:03.133
WE SHOULD JUST, UH, WE'RE
A LITTLE NERVOUS AND AWKWARD.

14:03.167 --> 14:06.133
WE JUST HAVE TO ADMIT THAT
WE'RE NERVOUS AND WE'RE AWKWARD.

14:06.167 --> 14:08.100
YEAH, IT'S A LITTLE AWKWARD.
YEAH. BECAUSE WHY?

14:08.133 --> 14:10.267
BECAUSE WE'RE NERVOUS.
(laughs)

14:10.300 --> 14:12.733
SO WE JUST NEED TO,
YOU KNOW, GET OVER OURSELVES.

14:12.767 --> 14:15.333
HOW?
UM...

14:15.367 --> 14:17.033
(sighs)

14:17.067 --> 14:20.167
WE COULD PICK A FANTASY.

14:20.200 --> 14:21.533
WHAT?

14:21.567 --> 14:23.333
YOU KNOW, A FANTASY.

14:23.367 --> 14:25.400
WE COULD PICK A FANTASY,

14:25.433 --> 14:28.200
ANY... FANTASY.

14:28.233 --> 14:30.067
ANY...

14:30.100 --> 14:34.033
I WILL DO ANYTHING
THAT YOU WANT ME TO.

14:34.067 --> 14:36.833
ANYTHING?

14:40.567 --> 14:41.800
THAT'S WHAT YOU WANTED?

14:41.833 --> 14:43.467
NO.

14:43.500 --> 14:47.100
I MEAN... Y-YES, BUT...

14:47.133 --> 14:50.233
THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEANT.

14:50.267 --> 14:52.200
WHAT DID YOU MEAN THEN?

14:52.233 --> 14:54.367
OKAY, LET'S JUST NOT EVER
TALK ABOUT THIS AGAIN.

14:54.400 --> 14:56.500
PLEASE?

14:56.533 --> 14:58.267
WE HAVE CHEMISTRY,
GEORGE.

14:58.300 --> 14:59.767
I KNOW WE HAVE IT

14:59.800 --> 15:02.667
BECAUSE WE HAD THE BEST SEX
I HAVE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE.

15:02.700 --> 15:04.800
DO YOU REMEMBER THAT SEX?
I DO.

15:04.833 --> 15:06.733
IT'S VAGUE
AND IT'S IN FLASHES,

15:06.767 --> 15:08.567
BUT I DO.

15:08.600 --> 15:10.700
I WANT THAT SEX BACK.
WE CAN DO THIS.

15:10.733 --> 15:13.467
WELL, I WANT THAT SEX BACK.

15:13.500 --> 15:16.333
I THINK I CHIPPED MY TOOTH.

15:18.600 --> 15:21.467
WELL, I'VE BEEN TRYING
TO DO WHAT YOU SAID,

15:21.500 --> 15:24.033
BUT IT'S NOT WORKING.
UH, WHAT--
WHAT DID I SAY?

15:24.067 --> 15:25.033
TO TRY ANOTHER SPECIALTY.

15:25.067 --> 15:26.900
YEAH, CRISTINA, I HAVE
BACK-TO-BACK SURGERIES,

15:26.933 --> 15:29.333
AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT, SO...
UH, DR. BAILEY SAID
IT WAS YOUR IDEA,

15:29.367 --> 15:31.833
BUT I THOUGHT MAYBE
I COULD HAVE SOME INPUT--

15:31.867 --> 15:34.233
OH! OH, YEAH. YEAH, THAT.

15:34.267 --> 15:36.200
THE--YEAH, MY IDEA TO--

15:36.233 --> 15:39.400
FOR YOU TO TRY
OTHER SPECIALTIES.

15:39.433 --> 15:42.333
SO CAN I, UH,
CAN I SCRUB IN WITH YOU?

15:42.367 --> 15:45.133
YOU HATE ORTHO.
NO, I LOVE ORTHO.

15:45.167 --> 15:48.567
BUT I CAN'T OBSERVE ANYMORE.
I NEED TO SCRUB IN,

15:48.600 --> 15:51.267
EVEN IF IT'S ON ORTHO,
WHICH I LOVE.

15:54.067 --> 15:55.267
OKAY.

15:55.300 --> 15:58.033
(mouths words)

15:58.067 --> 15:59.567
(elevator bell dings)

15:59.600 --> 16:00.533
MORNING.

16:00.567 --> 16:02.267
MORNING.

16:03.767 --> 16:06.267
I'M A PERSON OF SUBSTANCE.

16:06.300 --> 16:08.233
PLASTICS
ISN'T ALL FACE-LIFTS.

16:08.267 --> 16:11.067
I DO MANY... SUBSTANTIAL,
LIFE-CHANGING SURGERIES.

16:11.100 --> 16:13.100
MM.
(ding)

16:13.133 --> 16:15.367
HEY.

16:15.400 --> 16:18.633

STILL THERE.

16:18.667 --> 16:20.567
OH?

16:20.600 --> 16:22.767
MAKE SURE YOU WATCH 'EM
MARK IT WITH THE TAPE.
MM.

16:22.800 --> 16:24.233
(clears throat)

16:24.267 --> 16:26.167
AND EVERYONE THINKS
IT'S SO EASY

16:26.200 --> 16:27.500
BEING
THE CHIEF'S GIRLFRIEND.

16:27.533 --> 16:28.467
(chuckles)

16:28.500 --> 16:30.400
IF YOU NEED TO TALK,
I'M HERE.

16:30.433 --> 16:32.200
YEAH.

16:32.233 --> 16:34.533
(groans)

16:37.200 --> 16:39.100
OH, HI.

16:39.133 --> 16:42.433
UH, I JUST CAME BY
TO UPDATE HIM ON THE BABY.

16:42.467 --> 16:45.333
BUT I CAN, UH, COME BACK.

16:45.367 --> 16:47.300
LISTEN, I HAD, UH...

16:47.333 --> 16:50.200

IT WAS YOUR HOUSE.

16:50.233 --> 16:51.733
I--AND--AND, YOU KNOW,

16:51.767 --> 16:54.067
I--I'M NOT THE GIRL
WHO SLEEPS AROUND. I'M NOT.

16:54.100 --> 16:57.400
IT'S JUST, YOU KNOW, I--THERE'S
SO MUCH GOING ON AT HOME--

16:57.433 --> 17:00.300
(man) HEY, HOW IS SHE DOING?

17:00.333 --> 17:02.233
SHE MADE IT
THROUGH THE NIGHT.

17:02.267 --> 17:04.000
THAT'S A VERY GOOD SIGN.

17:06.067 --> 17:07.267
OH, YEAH.

17:07.300 --> 17:09.733
YEAH, WELL, SHE'S STRONG.
SHE'LL MAKE IT.

17:09.767 --> 17:14.567
SHE'S NOT GONNA LET THAT BABY
GROW UP WITHOUT A MOTHER. HUH?

17:17.467 --> 17:19.267
(man) HEY.

17:19.300 --> 17:22.100
HEY, YOU'RE OKAY.
(mutters)

17:22.133 --> 17:24.200
UH, NO, DON'T--
DON'T TRY TO TALK, OKAY?

17:28.167 --> 17:30.700
YOUR BABY'S FINE.

17:30.733 --> 17:33.633
SHE'S FEEDING WELL.
S-SHE'S DOING GREAT.

17:33.667 --> 17:36.533
I CAN GET HER IF YOU'D LIKE.

17:36.567 --> 17:40.367
DR. GREY, WHY DON'T YOU
GO GET THE BABY?

17:40.400 --> 17:44.400
YOU'RE DR. GREY, TOO?
ARE YOU TWO SISTERS?

17:45.433 --> 17:50.067
NO.
UH, JUST SAME LAST NAME.

17:50.100 --> 17:53.067
HMM.

17:59.433 --> 18:02.600
I WAS JUST THINKING ABOUT
THIS CRAP I TOOK IN THE ARMY.

18:02.633 --> 18:05.133
STILL NOTHING? I GAVE YOU
A PRETTY GOOD LAXATIVE.

18:05.167 --> 18:07.133
NOT STRONG ENOUGH
APPARENTLY.

18:07.167 --> 18:09.033
HAVE A SEAT, DR. KAREV.
IF I CAN'T CRAP,

18:09.067 --> 18:12.100
YOU'RE GOING TO SIT HERE
WHILE I REMINISCE.

18:14.100 --> 18:15.567
MORNING, HARRIET.

18:15.600 --> 18:17.600
LET'S GET YOU OUT OF BED,
GET YOU MOBILE.

18:17.633 --> 18:20.500
MM, I'M IN TOO MUCH PAIN.
LEAVE ME ALONE.
YEP, THE BEST THING FOR PAIN

18:20.533 --> 18:22.433
IS TO GET YOU OUT OF BED,
GET YOU MOVIN'.

18:22.467 --> 18:25.500
YOU'LL FEEL MUCH BETTER.
I WILL FEEL BETTER
IF YOU LEAVE.

18:25.533 --> 18:27.733
HARRIET--
STOP SCOWLING.

18:27.767 --> 18:29.233
YOU CAN SCOWL LATER

18:29.267 --> 18:31.300
WHEN YOU ACTUALLY HAVE
SOMETHING TO SCOWL ABOUT...

18:31.333 --> 18:33.333
(sighs)
WHEN YOUR ASS EXPANDS
AND YOU GET A DOUBLE CHIN.

18:33.367 --> 18:36.033
BUT RIGHT NOW, YOU ARE YOUNG.
YOU SHOULD BE HAVING FUN.

18:36.067 --> 18:38.233
GO, START ENJOYING YOUR LIFE.

18:38.267 --> 18:40.467
YOU'RE GETTING UGLIER
BY THE MINUTE.

18:43.067 --> 18:44.800
(monitor beeping erratically)

18:44.833 --> 18:47.467
HER HEART STOPPED AGAIN.
THEY GOT IT STARTED,

18:47.500 --> 18:49.267
BUT LOOK, I CAN'T
DEAL WITH HER RIGHT NOW.

18:49.300 --> 18:51.167
COULD YOU JUST TAKE HER BACK?

18:51.200 --> 18:53.167
(beeping continues)

18:53.200 --> 18:57.533
NOW!
COULD YOU TAKE HER AWAY NOW?

18:59.567 --> 19:00.067
(instrument whirring)

19:00.100 --> 19:01.067
(pop music playing)

19:01.100 --> 19:02.067
UH, DR. TORRES, COULD I
TALK TO YOU A MINUTE?

19:02.100 --> 19:04.667
UH, I'M IN THE MIDDLE
OF A SHATTERED FEMUR.

19:04.700 --> 19:07.233
THANK GOD FOR MEN WHO
RIDE MOTORCYCLES, RIGHT, YANG?

19:07.267 --> 19:09.433
(laughs)
RIGHT.

19:09.467 --> 19:11.133
UH, THERE ARE

19:11.167 --> 19:13.833
SOME SCHEDULING ISSUES
YOU HAVE TO DEAL WITH.

19:13.867 --> 19:16.667
YEAH, CAN YOU HANDLE IT AGAIN?
THANKS.

19:16.700 --> 19:18.600
(music continues)

19:18.633 --> 19:20.567
I NEED TO TALK
TO DR. TORRES.

19:20.600 --> 19:22.233
MY PATIENT WON'T CRAP

19:22.267 --> 19:25.333
AND WON'T STOP
TALKING ABOUT IT.

19:25.367 --> 19:27.267
I'M DONE.
IS DR. TORRES IN THERE?

19:27.300 --> 19:28.633
MY FACE-LIFT WON'T WALK,

19:28.667 --> 19:31.567
AND SHE IS ABUSIVE.
I CAN'T WORK WITH HER.
DR. SHEPHERD'S READY

19:31.600 --> 19:33.133
TO DISCHARGE
TERESA BROTHERTON'S BABY,

19:33.167 --> 19:35.733
BUT THE FATHER'S IN NO CONDITION
TO TAKE CARE OF HER.

19:35.767 --> 19:36.767
OKAY, IS THERE A PROBLEM?

19:36.800 --> 19:38.367
UH, JUST A LITTLE
ADMINISTRATIVE TRAFFIC JAM.

19:38.400 --> 19:40.500
DR. TORRES
HAS IT UNDER CONTROL.

19:42.433 --> 19:43.633
OKAY, HERE'S WHAT'S
GONNA HAPPEN--

19:43.667 --> 19:45.567
TAKE CRAP MAN AND PUT HIM

19:45.600 --> 19:47.500
IN THE SAME ROOM
WITH LAZY FACE-LIFT.

19:47.533 --> 19:51.033
THEY CAN ABUSE EACH OTHER.

19:51.067 --> 19:52.800
THE BABY
CAN STAY ANOTHER NIGHT.

19:52.833 --> 19:53.833
NOW GET OUT OF HERE.

19:53.867 --> 19:58.400
AND IF ANYONE ASKS,
NONE OF THIS WAS MY IDEA.

19:58.433 --> 20:00.333
EXCUSE US.
WHERE DOES IT HURT?

20:00.367 --> 20:02.467
(strained voice)
EVERYWHERE.
DIDN'T THE MARBLE COME OUT?

20:02.500 --> 20:04.600
YEAH, LAST NIGHT.
OH, IT REALLY HURTS.

20:04.633 --> 20:06.667
I ATE SOME MORE.
(man) YOU WHAT?

20:06.700 --> 20:09.333
YOU SAID YOU TOOK
THE REST FROM HIS ROOM.
I DID.

20:09.367 --> 20:11.100
WELL, OBVIOUSLY YOU DIDN'T.
(Brian screams)

20:11.133 --> 20:13.300
BRIAN, HOW MANY DID YOU EAT?

20:13.333 --> 20:15.067
EIGHT. (screams)

20:19.100 --> 20:21.067
IS THIS WHAT YOU ATE?

20:21.100 --> 20:23.400
BRIAN, THIS ISN'T A MARBLE.
THIS IS A MAGNET.

20:23.433 --> 20:27.267
(screaming)
PAGE DR. BAILEY.
TELL HER IT'S AN EMERGENCY.

20:27.300 --> 20:29.200
THE MAGNETS TAKE THE PATH
OF LEAST RESISTANCE

20:29.233 --> 20:30.367
TO GET TO EACH OTHER.

20:30.400 --> 20:34.133
IF THAT MEANS GOING THROUGH
THE WALL OF THE INTESTINE,

20:34.167 --> 20:36.067
THEN THAT'S
WHAT THEY'RE GONNA DO.

20:36.100 --> 20:38.067
YEAH, YEAH. I'M LOOKING
AT PERFED BOWEL HERE.

20:38.100 --> 20:39.367
HE'S GONNA NEED SURGERY.

20:39.400 --> 20:42.200
DR. BAILEY...

20:42.233 --> 20:44.700
THERE'S ANOTHER ONE,
AND IT'S MOVING.

20:44.733 --> 20:47.400
LIKE
A SLOW-MOTION GUNSHOT.

20:47.433 --> 20:49.267
ALL RIGHT, WE GOTTA STOP IT

20:49.300 --> 20:50.667
BEFORE IT RIPS THROUGH
HIS STOMACH AND KILLS HIM.

20:58.467 --> 21:01.267
HERE WE GO, JERRY.
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?

21:01.300 --> 21:03.800
OH, ROOM SHORTAGE.
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO DOUBLE UP.
WHAT?

21:03.833 --> 21:07.067
YEAH. HARRIET, MEET JERRY.
THIS IS ABSURD.

21:07.100 --> 21:10.500
OH, NOT SO ANGRY, JERRY. IT'S
NOT GOOD FOR THE COMPLEXION.

21:10.533 --> 21:11.733
RIGHT, HARRIET?
HARRIET, JERRY MAY BE
MONOPOLIZING THE BATHROOM

21:11.767 --> 21:13.000
FOR A FEW HOURS,

21:13.033 --> 21:14.133
SO IF YOU NEED TO GO,
I'D GO NOW.
THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE.

21:14.167 --> 21:17.333
I DON'T EVEN THINK IT'S LEGAL.
WELL, MY ADVICE WOULD BE

21:17.367 --> 21:20.633
TO GET YOURSELVES DISCHARGED
AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE.
SEE YA.

21:24.200 --> 21:29.133
I HAVE SEVEN MAGNETS
IN MY TRAY.

21:29.167 --> 21:30.800
HE SAID HE SWALLOWED EIGHT.

21:30.833 --> 21:34.033
HE HAS A HOLE
IN HIS DIAPHRAGM.

21:34.067 --> 21:36.567
ONE COULD HAVE WANDERED UP
TO HIS CHEST.

21:36.600 --> 21:38.633
FORCEPS.
AREN'T YOU GONNA REPAIR
THE DIAPHRAGM?

21:38.667 --> 21:41.533
UH, FIRST I WANT TO SEE
IF THE MAGNET WILL FIND ME.

21:41.567 --> 21:43.400
(instruments clicking)

21:43.433 --> 21:46.500
YOU KNOW HE DID THIS SO HIS
PARENTS WOULD GET A DIVORCE?

21:46.533 --> 21:49.267
THEY FIGHT ALL THE TIME,
SO HE MADE HIMSELF SICK

21:49.300 --> 21:53.033
SO THEY WOULD
TAKE HIM SERIOUSLY.
I BET THEY
TAKE HIM SERIOUSLY NOW.

21:53.067 --> 21:56.067
NAH. THEY SAID THEY'D TRY
NOT TO FIGHT SO MUCH.

21:56.100 --> 21:58.367
I AM ELBOW DEEP
IN THEIR 8 YEAR OLD... TSK.

21:58.400 --> 21:59.833
SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING

21:59.867 --> 22:02.333
A LITTLE EXTRA EFFORT
CAN'T FIX.

22:02.367 --> 22:04.167
YOU'RE PROBABLY RIGHT.

22:04.200 --> 22:07.367
I AM SO RIGHT
ABOUT SO MANY THINGS,

22:07.400 --> 22:09.533
IT'LL MAKE YOUR HEAD SPIN.

22:11.400 --> 22:13.833
(Mark)
HER HANDS ARE BEAUTIFUL.

22:13.867 --> 22:17.233
I MEAN, SURGICALLY,
THE FINESSE.

22:17.267 --> 22:19.133
I WAS IN ORTHO ALL DAY.

22:19.167 --> 22:20.833
THERE IS NO FINESSE
TO BREAKING BONES.

22:20.867 --> 22:23.333
YEAH, IT'S CARPENTRY.
CARPENTRY.

22:23.367 --> 22:26.200
YEAH. YOU WANT FINESSE,
YOU SHOULD TRY PLASTICS.

22:26.233 --> 22:27.533
IT'S ALL FINESSE.

22:27.567 --> 22:30.033
YEAH, NO ROOM FOR ERROR

22:30.067 --> 22:32.200
WHEN YOU'RE DEALING
WITH SOMEONE'S FACE.

22:32.233 --> 22:34.333
IT'S MORE
THAN JUST FACE-LIFTS.

22:34.367 --> 22:36.400
I'M A BOARD CERTIFIED E.N.T.

22:36.433 --> 22:38.433
I TAKE OUT TUMORS.

22:39.833 --> 22:42.433
IT'S ALSO
A LOT OF FACE-LIFTS.

22:42.467 --> 22:46.733
BUT EVEN A FACE-LIFT...
I'M CHANGING A LIFE.

22:46.767 --> 22:50.067
I'M HOLDING
SOMEONE'S FUTURE IN MY HANDS.

22:55.300 --> 22:58.400
HOLDING A HEART
IS WAY BETTER.

23:00.300 --> 23:03.700
(baby crying)

23:09.833 --> 23:12.300
SHE'S GOOD.

23:12.333 --> 23:13.700
SHE'S SLEEPING,

23:13.733 --> 23:17.467
BUT WE CAN GO IN
IF YOU WANT TO...

23:19.633 --> 23:24.267
DR. HAHN SAID THAT, UH,
TERESA'S...

23:24.300 --> 23:27.300
SHE'S NOT IN GOOD SHAPE.

23:27.333 --> 23:30.233
HER OTHER LUNG
IS LEAKING NOW.

23:30.267 --> 23:33.400
AND THEY CAN'T OPERATE
BECAUSE HER HEART IS TOO WEAK

23:33.433 --> 23:36.500
FROM ALL THE STRAIN.

23:36.533 --> 23:37.733
SO THEY'RE GONNA SEE

23:37.767 --> 23:39.667
IF SHE'S GONNA MAKE IT
THROUGH THE NIGHT

23:39.700 --> 23:42.600
AND REASSESS IN THE MORNING.

23:42.633 --> 23:44.100
I AM SO SORRY.

23:44.133 --> 23:45.500
YEAH.

23:45.533 --> 23:47.833
I-I NEED TO KNOW
WHO TO CALL

23:47.867 --> 23:51.067
JUST IN CASE
MY WIFE DOESN'T MAKE IT.

23:51.100 --> 23:53.200
I CAN'T DO THIS ON MY OWN.

23:53.233 --> 23:56.133
I KNOW WHAT I'M CAPABLE OF,

23:56.167 --> 23:59.700
AND I-I CAN'T RAISE A KID
WITHOUT MY WIFE...

23:59.733 --> 24:02.433
A KID THAT'S NOT EVEN
MY OWN BLOOD.

24:02.467 --> 24:05.633
THE KID DESERVES A FAMILY.

24:05.667 --> 24:08.167
AND HEY, I'M NOT A BAD GUY,

24:08.200 --> 24:10.100
AND I-I SEE HER,

24:10.133 --> 24:12.033
AND SHE'S--
SHE'S GOOD, YOU KNOW?

24:12.067 --> 24:14.267
SHE'S--SHE'S A GOOD BABY,
BUT I'M NOT...

24:14.300 --> 24:15.767
YOU'RE HER FATHER.

24:15.800 --> 24:17.267
SH-SHE NEEDS YOU.

24:17.300 --> 24:19.800
SHE NEEDS YOU NOW MORE...

24:19.833 --> 24:21.333
YOU'RE HER FATHER.

24:21.367 --> 24:23.733
I DON'T FEEL
LIKE HER FATHER.

24:23.767 --> 24:27.567
I LOOK AT HER, AND I D--
I S--

24:27.600 --> 24:30.100
I SEE THAT SHE'S NOT MINE.

24:30.133 --> 24:32.667
SHE'S JUST A BABY.

24:43.100 --> 24:45.533
OH.

24:45.567 --> 24:47.467
WHAT DID YOU DO TONIGHT?

24:47.500 --> 24:49.400
I STAYED LATE AT WORK

24:49.433 --> 24:51.333
BECAUSE MY HOUSE
IS A BROTHEL.
(laughs)

24:51.367 --> 24:53.467
WHAT DID YOU DO

24:53.500 --> 24:55.567
OH, NO.
WHAT?

24:55.600 --> 24:57.500
OH, DINNER AND A MOVIE.
DINNER AND A MOVIE?

24:57.533 --> 24:59.800
OH!
ALL RIGHT, DINNER--

24:59.833 --> 25:02.333
(squeals)
OH, DEAR. UH, UH, I'M SORRY.

25:02.367 --> 25:04.267
I'LL JUST, UH--
OKAY, I'M--I'M--I'M SORRY.
(gasps) CHIEF...

25:04.300 --> 25:05.800
I'M SORRY, OKAY?

25:05.833 --> 25:08.833
IT'S A BOX OF FUN.
YOU KNOW?

25:08.867 --> 25:11.767
IT'S JUST BEEN...

25:11.800 --> 25:13.433
TOO MUCH.

25:13.467 --> 25:14.667
TOO MUCH PRESSURE.

25:14.700 --> 25:16.600
YEAH.
TOO MUCH TRYING.

25:16.633 --> 25:19.533
WE JUST GOTTA GET BACK
TO HAVING FUN.

25:19.567 --> 25:21.467
YEAH.
SO IT'S A BOX OF PROPS?

25:21.500 --> 25:23.133
IT'S A BOX OF FUN.

25:23.167 --> 25:24.400
OKAY.

25:24.433 --> 25:25.733
CAN I...

25:25.767 --> 25:26.833
MM-HMM.

25:26.867 --> 25:28.567
OKAY.

25:28.600 --> 25:30.200
A BOX OF FUN AND BOOZE,

25:30.233 --> 25:32.133
'CAUSE I FIGURE
IT CAN'T HURT.

25:32.167 --> 25:34.067
YEAH, YEAH. OH, THAT--
(laughs) THAT'S A--

25:34.100 --> 25:36.700
NO. YOU KNOW WHAT? DON'T--
DON'T--DON'T SAY IT.

25:36.733 --> 25:38.467
THIS WILL WORK.
YEAH?

25:38.500 --> 25:41.400
WE WILL WORK. WE JUST NEED
TO TAKE THE PRESSURE OFF.
YEAH.

25:41.433 --> 25:43.333
WE HAVE THE HOUSE
TO OURSELVES TONIGHT.
GOOD.

25:43.367 --> 25:46.400
WE'RE GONNA HAVE A DRINK
AND WE'RE GONNA PLAY.

25:46.433 --> 25:48.067
WE'RE GONNA...

25:48.100 --> 25:50.067
WE'LL PLAY.

25:50.100 --> 25:51.833
PLAY...
WITH OUR BOX OF FUN.

25:51.867 --> 25:53.700
(chuckles)

25:55.200 --> 25:57.400
(chuckles)

25:57.433 --> 26:00.633
(George and Izzie giggling)

26:00.667 --> 26:02.567
YOU DEFINITELY DON'T WANT
TO GO IN THERE.

26:02.600 --> 26:05.400
OH, ALEX.
GEORGE AND IZZIE?

26:05.433 --> 26:06.533
YEAH.

26:06.567 --> 26:09.500
(sighs)

26:09.533 --> 26:12.033
I THINK THE CHIEF
JUST SAW ME NAKED.

26:12.067 --> 26:13.133
MM. NICE.

26:13.167 --> 26:15.333
(car door closes)

26:15.367 --> 26:18.233
(whispers) I THOUGHT
I SAID NO HAVING SEX WITH HER

26:18.267 --> 26:21.067
AT THIS HOUSE?
I DIDN'T INVITE HER OVER.

26:23.333 --> 26:24.833
HI.
HEY.

26:24.867 --> 26:28.333
UM, ALEX, DO YOU WANT TO GET
A DRINK AT JOE'S?

26:28.367 --> 26:30.267
YEAH, SURE.

26:30.300 --> 26:32.533
ALEX.

26:34.267 --> 26:37.400
THERE'S NO RULE THAT SAYS
HE CAN'T HAVE A DRINK WITH ME.

26:37.433 --> 26:39.233
ACTUALLY, THERE IS.
I'M MAKING ONE.

26:39.267 --> 26:42.167
NO DRINKING WITH ALEX,
NO SLEEPING WITH ALEX.

26:42.200 --> 26:44.133
WHAT EXACTLY
DID I EVER DO TO YOU?

26:44.167 --> 26:46.500
GET YOUR OWN FRIENDS.
GET YOUR OWN LIFE.

26:46.533 --> 26:48.467
STOP LIVING IN MINE.

26:48.500 --> 26:51.100
SCREW YOU.

26:51.133 --> 26:53.133
I--I'LL WAIT AT THE CAR.

26:55.600 --> 26:58.467
I KNOW THAT WAS MEAN,
BUT SHE'S EVERYWHERE.

26:58.500 --> 27:00.733
YOU SAY
SHE'S NOT YOUR SISTER.

27:00.767 --> 27:02.567
YOU SAY YOU DON'T WANT
TO KNOW HER.

27:02.600 --> 27:06.167
SO WHY THE HELL
DO YOU CARE SO MUCH?

27:06.200 --> 27:08.800
I DON'T. I DON'T.

27:08.833 --> 27:11.633
I DON'T CARE.

27:17.500 --> 27:18.333
(alarm beeps)

27:19.267 --> 27:21.133
MORNING.
HEY.

27:21.167 --> 27:22.667
GOTTA GET TO WORK.

27:22.700 --> 27:25.367
YEAH, YEAH, ME, TOO.
GOTTA GO, GOTTA GO.

27:28.433 --> 27:29.533
(elevator bell dings)

27:29.567 --> 27:31.200
ALL I'M SAYING IS,

27:31.233 --> 27:34.200
THE NEXT TIME YOU HAVE COMPANY,
LOCK THE DOOR.

27:34.233 --> 27:35.733
ALL I'M SAYING IS,

27:35.767 --> 27:38.200
NEXT TIME YOU COME OVER,
YOU SHOULD KNOCK.

27:38.233 --> 27:40.433
(ding)

27:42.533 --> 27:44.633
(ding)

27:49.400 --> 27:50.767
WHERE IS SHE?

27:50.800 --> 27:52.267
OH, WELL.

27:52.300 --> 27:54.200
IT LOOKS LIKE SHE FINALLY
GOT OUT OF BED.

27:54.233 --> 27:55.567
(man and woman laughing)

27:55.600 --> 27:57.100
(gasps)

27:57.133 --> 27:59.167
IT--OH!

27:59.200 --> 28:00.367
OH, MY GOD!

28:00.400 --> 28:03.033
WE'RE ADULTS.
DON'T LOOK SO SHOCKED.

28:03.067 --> 28:04.767
(Harriet)
SHE ALWAYS LOOKS LIKE THAT.

28:04.800 --> 28:07.533
(laughs)

28:07.567 --> 28:09.500
WELL, I GUESS
HE FINALLY CRAPPED.

28:09.533 --> 28:10.600
(scoffs)

28:10.633 --> 28:11.733
WHAT?

28:11.767 --> 28:14.100
EVEN THEY HAVE CHEMISTRY.

28:15.800 --> 28:17.367
DR. O'MALLEY, HE'S...

28:17.400 --> 28:20.333
BRIAN--HE'S REALLY
GONNA BE OKAY, RIGHT?

28:20.367 --> 28:24.133
KIDS BOUNCE BACK MORE QUICKLY
THAN ADULTS, SO...

28:24.167 --> 28:26.833
WE USED TO BE REALLY HAPPY.

28:26.867 --> 28:28.200
I'M SORRY?

28:28.233 --> 28:30.467
MY HUSBAND AND I,
WE REALLY WERE...

28:30.500 --> 28:32.633
BEFORE.

28:32.667 --> 28:36.367
BRIAN WAS A COLICKY BABY,
AND DON LOST HIS JOB,

28:36.400 --> 28:37.433
AND MY MOTHER DIED,

28:37.467 --> 28:40.733
AND ALL THIS BAGGAGE
PILED UP.
I'M S--I'M D--

28:40.767 --> 28:43.633
I JUST KEEP THINKING THAT
WE HAVE TO GET BACK THERE.

28:43.667 --> 28:45.433
MAYBE BRIAN'S RIGHT.

28:45.467 --> 28:49.167
MAYBE DON AND I DO NEED
A BREAK FROM EACH OTHER.

28:49.200 --> 28:53.300
WE HAVEN'T BEEN HAPPY
IN A LONG TIME.

29:00.400 --> 29:02.300
SHE PUT HER ON
A HEART AND LUNG MACHINE

29:02.333 --> 29:03.533
IN HER ROOM?

29:03.567 --> 29:05.733
YEAH. SHE WASN'T GONNA SURVIVE
ANOTHER DAY

29:05.767 --> 29:07.267
WITHOUT THE SURGERY,

29:07.300 --> 29:09.533
AND SHE WAS TOO UNSTABLE
TO TRANSPORT TO THE O.R.,

29:09.567 --> 29:11.467
SO HAHN HAD TO BRING
THE O.R. TO HER.

29:11.500 --> 29:13.733
IT'S PRETTY GENIUS,
RIGHT?
IT'S GENIUS.

29:13.767 --> 29:15.833
(Erica) GREY.

29:15.867 --> 29:17.767
MAKE SURE HER LINES ARE CLEAR.

29:17.800 --> 29:19.700
THE LAST THING WE NEED
IS A KINK

29:19.733 --> 29:22.167
TO SEND HER INTO ARREST.

29:22.200 --> 29:25.033
ANYBODY GETS SO MUCH
AS A BAD FEELING,

29:25.067 --> 29:26.800
WE STOP AND WE REASSESS.
SHE'S GONNA MAKE IT,
RIGHT?

29:26.833 --> 29:28.733
HE SAID HE'S GONNA GIVE
HER BABY UP

29:28.767 --> 29:30.667
IF SHE DOESN'T MAKE IT.
SHE HAS TO MAKE IT.

29:30.700 --> 29:33.133
(Erica) OKAY, PEOPLE...
KINDA BUSY RIGHT NOW, LEX.

29:33.167 --> 29:36.033
ROAD TRIP.

29:36.067 --> 29:37.800
HEY.

29:37.833 --> 29:40.800
MR. BROTHERTON,
WE NEED TO GO NOW.

29:40.833 --> 29:45.400
I WILL SEND DR. GREY OUT TO YOU
WITH PERIODIC UPDATES.

29:45.433 --> 29:47.567
I PROMISE I'M GONNA DO
EVERYTHING IN MY POWER

29:47.600 --> 29:49.467
TO FIX YOUR WIFE.

30:10.433 --> 30:13.633
(Mark) I'VE GOT A THING
FOR HER.
(Derek) YOU DON'T HAVE
A THING FOR HER.

30:13.667 --> 30:16.433
I DO. I DO.
I HAVE A THING FOR HER.
IT'S GONNA END BADLY.

30:16.467 --> 30:19.167
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.
YES, I DO.

30:19.200 --> 30:21.567
WHAT DO YOU KNOW?
YOU'RE DATING THE CHIEF.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

30:21.600 --> 30:23.500
THAT JOKE'S NOT FUNNY ANYMORE.
IT'S OVERUSED.

30:23.533 --> 30:25.533
(quietly)
OH, HERE WE GO.

30:29.267 --> 30:31.467
(sighs)
LOVER'S QUARREL?

30:31.500 --> 30:32.833
OH, JEEZ.
(laughs)

30:32.867 --> 30:34.833
WE'RE NOT QUARRELING.
IT'S NOT A QUARREL.

30:34.867 --> 30:36.533
MORE IMPORTANTLY,
WE'RE NOT...

30:36.567 --> 30:37.733
IF I...
IN--

30:37.767 --> 30:40.500
GO THROUGH THE TROUBLE
TO CHOOSE A MOVIE,

30:40.533 --> 30:43.033
HE SHOULD HAVE ENOUGH
COMMON COURTESY TO MENTION IT

30:43.067 --> 30:44.267
IF HE MAKES OTHER PLANS--

30:44.300 --> 30:46.200
A PHONE CALL,
A NOTE, SOMETHING.

30:46.233 --> 30:49.100
AND IF HE'S NOT GONNA PICK UP
MY SHIRTS, JUST TELL ME.

30:49.133 --> 30:50.600
I'LL PICK THEM UP.

30:50.633 --> 30:53.733
I'M PERFECTLY CAPABLE
OF PICKING UP MY OWN SHIRTS.
NO. NO, YOU'RE NOT.

30:53.767 --> 30:55.667
YOU'RE NOT CAPABLE
OF PICKING UP YOUR SHIRTS.

30:55.700 --> 30:58.033
YOU'RE NOT CAPABLE OF DOING
ANYTHING ON YOUR OWN.

30:58.067 --> 31:00.367
IF I WASN'T AROUND,
YOU'D STARVE IN A DIRTY SHIRT

31:00.400 --> 31:02.800
AND DIE A LONELY DEATH.
OH, FOR GOD SAKES.

31:02.833 --> 31:05.367
YOU KNOW, I OFFERED YOU
A PLACE TO PUT YOUR TRAILER,

31:05.400 --> 31:07.300
AND YOU'VE BEEN
TAKING ADVANTAGE EVER SINCE.

31:07.333 --> 31:09.233
YOU CAN'T HANDLE PICKING UP
THE DRY CLEANING

31:09.267 --> 31:10.533
OR DOING THE COOKING,

31:10.567 --> 31:12.833
SO I HAVE TO PICK UP
ALL THE SLACK.

31:12.867 --> 31:16.067
HOLD THAT THOUGHT.

31:16.100 --> 31:19.433
YOU SEE?
HE CAN'T HANDLE THE TRUTH.

31:19.467 --> 31:22.733
I DEFINITELY
HAVE A THING FOR HER.

31:24.400 --> 31:26.333
MIRANDA, DO YOU HAVE
ANY IDEA

31:26.367 --> 31:29.133
WHY THE BROTHERTONS' BABY'S
STILL HERE?

31:29.167 --> 31:30.333
I BELIEVE DR. TORRES DECIDED

31:30.367 --> 31:33.133
TO KEEP THE BABY HERE
FOR ANOTHER DAY.

31:33.167 --> 31:35.300
WELL, WHY WOULD SHE DO THAT
IF DR. SHEPHERD WAS READY

31:35.333 --> 31:37.700
TO DISCHARGE HER?
I DON'T KNOW.
YOU'D HAVE TO ASK DR. TORRES.

31:37.733 --> 31:38.767
MM-HMM.

31:38.800 --> 31:41.733
I MEAN, IF IT WAS ME
AND THE MOTHER KEPT CODING,

31:41.767 --> 31:44.167
I MIGHT KEEP THE BABY AROUND
SO THEY COULD GET

31:44.200 --> 31:46.167
A LITTLE MORE TIME TOGETHER.

31:46.200 --> 31:47.467
MM-HMM.

31:47.500 --> 31:50.467
AND WHY DID TORRES
HAVE STEVENS AND KAREV

31:50.500 --> 31:53.133
PUT THEIR PATIENTS
IN THE SAME ROOM?

31:53.167 --> 31:55.067
THAT'S A CLEAR VIOLATION
OF PROTOCOL.

31:55.100 --> 31:57.500
UH, YOU'D HAVE TO ASK HER.

31:57.533 --> 32:00.400
BUT THOSE TWO PATIENTS
WERE IMPOSSIBLE,

32:00.433 --> 32:03.667
AND NEITHER ONE WAS WILLING
TO FOLLOW POST-OP INSTRUCTION,

32:03.700 --> 32:05.500
SO... I MEAN, IF IT WAS ME,

32:05.533 --> 32:07.433
I WOULD PUT THEM BOTH
IN THE SAME ROOM

32:07.467 --> 32:09.367
SO THEY COULD
ENCOURAGE EACH OTHER

32:09.400 --> 32:10.600
TO GET OUT OF HERE.

32:10.633 --> 32:13.733
AND SHE TOLD DR. YANG
TO FIND A NEW SPECIALTY?

32:13.767 --> 32:17.267
THAT'S A PRETTY ODD THING
TO SAY TO SOMEONE

32:17.300 --> 32:19.300
WHO HAS SUCH AN AFFINITY
FOR CARDIO.

32:19.333 --> 32:22.200
AGAIN,
YOU'LL HAVE TO ASK TORRES.
MM-HMM.

32:22.233 --> 32:24.433
BUT MAYBE IT HAS TO DO
WITH THE FACT

32:24.467 --> 32:26.400
THAT ERICA HAHN'S PUTTING HER
THROUGH HER PACES,

32:26.433 --> 32:28.767
SO YANG NEEDS TO SEE
WHAT ELSE IS OUT THERE,

32:28.800 --> 32:30.700
OTHERWISE SHE WON'T FIGHT
HARD ENOUGH

32:30.733 --> 32:32.633
TO STAY WITH CARDIO.

32:32.667 --> 32:34.167
I'M JUST GUESSING.

32:34.200 --> 32:35.533
YOU NEED TO ASK TORRES.

32:35.567 --> 32:37.600
THAT'S
JUST WHAT I'M GONNA DO.

32:37.633 --> 32:38.667
MM-HMM.

32:38.700 --> 32:41.567
(elevator bell dings)

32:49.767 --> 32:51.667
(Mr. Brotherton)
OKAY, IT'S BEEN AN HOUR.

32:51.700 --> 32:52.800
WE SHOULD'VE HEARD
SOMETHING.

32:52.833 --> 32:55.767
WELL, THE FACT THAT WE HAVEN'T
HEARD ANYTHING IS GOOD.

32:55.800 --> 32:58.600
THAT MEANS THAT THEY'VE
GOT HER IN THE O.R.

32:58.633 --> 32:59.767
AND THEY'VE OPENED HER UP.

32:59.800 --> 33:04.600
YOU KNOW, EVERY STEP OF THIS
THAT SHE SURVIVES IS GOOD.

33:06.367 --> 33:08.433
OH, GOD.

33:08.467 --> 33:10.367
SO WE WERE ABLE TO FIND

33:10.400 --> 33:12.467
ONE PUNCTURE
IN HER REMAINING LUNG.

33:12.500 --> 33:16.700
WE'RE PREPARING TO PLACE
A PATCH OVER IT.

33:16.733 --> 33:18.633
AND HOPEFULLY
THAT'S THE ONLY LEAK,

33:18.667 --> 33:20.733
AND HOPEFULLY
THE PATCH WILL HOLD.

33:20.767 --> 33:22.133
(sighs)

33:24.300 --> 33:27.567
I SHOULD BE GETTING BACK.

33:33.433 --> 33:35.333
YOU KNOW,
YOU SAID YOUR WIFE

33:35.367 --> 33:37.667
BONDED INSTANTLY
WITH THE BABY.

33:37.700 --> 33:40.367
FOR SOME PEOPLE,
IT'S LIKE THAT.

33:40.400 --> 33:41.733
FOR OTHER PEOPLE,

33:41.767 --> 33:43.700
THEY NEED A LITTLE MORE TIME
WITH A BABY

33:43.733 --> 33:45.633
BEFORE THEY CAN FEEL
LIKE A FAMILY.

33:45.667 --> 33:48.467
I BET YOU KNOW HER
BETTER THAN YOU THINK YOU DO.

33:48.500 --> 33:52.400
ALL I KNOW IS THAT SHE CRIES.
OKAY?

33:52.433 --> 33:55.167
AND SHE EATS A LOT.

33:55.200 --> 33:57.767
WE WERE GOING THROUGH FORMULA
LIKE CRAZY.

33:57.800 --> 34:02.033
AND SHE SLEEPS WITH HER HAND
UP UNDER HER CHIN.

34:02.067 --> 34:05.233
AND SHE LIKES MY WIFE.

34:05.267 --> 34:07.133
TERESA SOOTHES HER, YOU KNOW?

34:07.167 --> 34:10.700
SHE PUTS HER HAND
ON HER BACK...

34:10.733 --> 34:13.500
SHE LET'S HER
SUCK ON HER FINGER.

34:13.533 --> 34:15.333
BUT THAT'S ALL I KNOW.

34:15.367 --> 34:17.267
THAT'S FIVE THINGS
NO ONE ELSE KNOWS.

34:17.300 --> 34:20.500
THAT'S FIVE THINGS.

34:20.533 --> 34:23.600
***

34:30.133 --> 34:32.033
THE PATCH IS SECURE.

34:32.067 --> 34:34.100
WATER, PLEASE.

34:34.133 --> 34:36.433
***

34:36.467 --> 34:40.333
ALL RIGHT. LET'S SEE
IF I EARNED MY PAYCHECK TODAY.

34:40.367 --> 34:43.133
GO TO MANUAL.
GIVE ME A BREATH.

34:43.167 --> 34:46.167
***

34:52.700 --> 34:54.700
(Meredith) NO BUBBLES.

34:54.733 --> 34:56.633
SO FAR, SO GOOD.
ANOTHER BREATH.

34:56.667 --> 34:58.600
***

34:58.633 --> 35:02.233
I SEE BUBBLES.

35:02.267 --> 35:04.200
(monitor beeping erratically)
PATCH IS SECURE.

35:04.233 --> 35:05.667
CLAMP.

35:05.700 --> 35:08.100
OH, WE GOT ANOTHER LEAK.

35:08.133 --> 35:10.200
GREY, HOLD ON
TO THIS CLAMP, PLEASE.

35:10.233 --> 35:12.433
(beeping continues)

35:12.467 --> 35:15.700
***

35:15.733 --> 35:18.600
DR. TORRES,
YOU GOT A MOMENT?
UH, I DON'T, ACTUALLY,

35:18.633 --> 35:20.600
BECAUSE I HAVE
TWO MORE SURGERIES TODAY.

35:20.633 --> 35:22.533
BUT I KNOW THE SCHEDULE'S
BEEN A LITTLE CRAZY.

35:22.567 --> 35:24.467
I'LL GET ON IT TONIGHT.
NO, YOU'RE NOT, ACTUALLY.

35:24.500 --> 35:25.667
OKAY, YOU'RE RIGHT.

35:25.700 --> 35:27.667
IT MAY NOT HAPPEN
TILL TOMORROW, BUT, UH--

35:27.700 --> 35:29.667
YOU'RE NOT GONNA
GET ON IT AT ALL.

35:29.700 --> 35:33.400
***

35:39.267 --> 35:43.233
***

35:43.267 --> 35:46.567
MR. BROTHERTON,
WE DID EVERYTHING WE COULD,

35:46.600 --> 35:48.433
BUT...

35:48.467 --> 35:52.567
***

36:05.067 --> 36:08.067
***

36:15.867 --> 36:17.133
HEY.

36:17.167 --> 36:18.333
HEY.

36:18.367 --> 36:20.333
COOL LOUNGE.

36:20.367 --> 36:22.033
YEAH, NO INTERNS ALLOWED.

36:22.067 --> 36:23.233
I KNOW THAT.

36:23.267 --> 36:26.200
UM, I WAS LOOKING FOR YOU

36:26.233 --> 36:28.067
BECAUSE I WAS WONDERING IF...

36:28.100 --> 36:30.767
IF YOU WOULD MEET ME LATER...

36:30.800 --> 36:32.700
IN THE ON CALL ROOM.

36:32.733 --> 36:34.633
I CAN'T.

36:34.667 --> 36:36.133
OH, I--

36:36.167 --> 36:37.533
I THOUGHT YOU SAID THAT--

36:37.567 --> 36:40.433
YEAH, I KNOW WHAT I SAID,
BUT I CAN'T.

36:40.467 --> 36:42.367
BECAUSE OF MEREDITH.

36:42.400 --> 36:45.267
LOOK...
I'M NOT GETTING INVOLVED

36:45.300 --> 36:47.200
IN WHATEVER YOU TWO
GOT GOING ON.

36:47.233 --> 36:49.133
I'M NOT CHOOSING SIDES.

36:49.167 --> 36:52.100
EXCEPT...
CLEARLY YOU ARE.

36:52.133 --> 36:54.133
SO...

37:02.433 --> 37:04.233
DR. BAILEY...

37:04.267 --> 37:07.333
YOU'VE BEEN COVERING
FOR DR. TORRES.

37:07.367 --> 37:09.033
CHIEF, I--

37:09.067 --> 37:11.767
I'VE JUST BEEN SHUFFLING
A LITTLE PAPERWORK FOR HER.

37:11.800 --> 37:13.700
YOU'VE BEEN DOING
THE LION'S SHARE

37:13.733 --> 37:15.800
OF THE CHIEF RESIDENT'S WORK--

37:15.833 --> 37:19.500
ALL THE RESPONSIBILITY
AND NONE OF THE CREDIT.

37:19.533 --> 37:21.733
YOU DESERVE THE CREDIT.

37:21.767 --> 37:24.500
YOU DESERVE THE JOB.

37:24.533 --> 37:27.400
I SHOULD'VE GIVEN IT TO YOU
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

37:27.433 --> 37:30.100
I HOPE YOU'LL TAKE IT NOW.

37:30.133 --> 37:33.333
BECAUSE WHAT YOU DO
AND HOW YOU DO IT

37:33.367 --> 37:37.033
MAKES THIS HOSPITAL WORK.

37:39.467 --> 37:42.033
WELL, IT'S ABOUT TIME
YOU NOTICED.

37:45.667 --> 37:47.667
'CAUSE...

37:51.133 --> 37:54.133
(crying)

38:00.600 --> 38:04.367
(crying continues)

38:04.400 --> 38:07.400
(baby crying)

38:28.400 --> 38:31.067
(sighs)

38:34.133 --> 38:36.567
CAN I PICK HER UP?

38:36.600 --> 38:38.567
YEAH, OF COURSE.

38:38.600 --> 38:40.500
NURSE.

38:46.267 --> 38:48.200
HERE, LET ME...

38:48.233 --> 38:50.633
HELP YOU.

38:50.667 --> 38:52.133
(coos)

38:54.533 --> 38:57.433
IT'S OKAY.

38:57.467 --> 38:59.333
(sniffles)

38:59.367 --> 39:03.133
I REMEMBERED A SIXTH THING.

39:04.867 --> 39:06.433
SHE HATES THE CAR SEAT...

39:08.433 --> 39:11.233
U-UNLESS YOU PUT THIS
LITTLE DUCK UP UNDER HER HEAD.

39:11.267 --> 39:13.167
YOU KNOW?

39:13.200 --> 39:15.733
HEY.

39:15.767 --> 39:18.567
I'M GONNA NAME YOU KEISHA,
OKAY?

39:18.600 --> 39:23.467
'CAUSE THAT'S WHAT
YOUR MOMMY WANTED TO NAME YOU.

39:39.733 --> 39:41.333
I AM NOT STALKING.

39:41.367 --> 39:43.233
I JUST...

39:43.267 --> 39:44.600
I HATE APPLES.

39:44.633 --> 39:46.533
HATE THEM.

39:46.567 --> 39:49.433
THINK THEY SHOULDN'T
BE ALLOWED TO BE A FRUIT.

39:49.467 --> 39:51.433
THAT'S ONE.

39:51.467 --> 39:53.700
AND--AND TWO, I CAN DRAW
REALLY, REALLY WELL

39:53.733 --> 39:55.233
ON AN Etch A Sketch.

39:55.267 --> 39:56.600
LIKE, REALLY WELL,

39:56.633 --> 39:58.833
LIKE,
I COULD BE A PROFESSIONAL

39:58.867 --> 40:01.233
IF, YOU KNOW,
THAT PROFESSION EXISTED.

40:01.267 --> 40:03.600
I PLAY THE TROMBONE...
BADLY.

40:03.633 --> 40:05.700
UH, I LIKE MATH.

40:05.733 --> 40:08.600
AND I NOTICE THAT YOU DO
THIS THING WITH YOUR HANDS

40:08.633 --> 40:10.500
WHEN YOU'RE TRYING
TO MAKE A POINT,

40:10.533 --> 40:12.433
LIKE--LIKE--LIKE THIS,
WITH YOUR HANDS.

40:12.467 --> 40:14.533
AND I KNOW THAT
THAT'S ABOUT YOU, BUT I--

40:14.567 --> 40:16.200
I DO IT, TOO,

40:16.233 --> 40:17.667
SO IT'S ALSO ABOUT ME.

40:17.700 --> 40:20.633
AND SO THAT'S FIVE--

40:20.667 --> 40:23.067
FIVE THINGS
THAT I'M HOPING

40:23.100 --> 40:24.833
WILL MAKE IT
A LITTLE BIT HARDER

40:24.867 --> 40:27.233
FOR YOU TO HATE ME.

40:33.533 --> 40:35.267
(sighs)

40:41.200 --> 40:43.067
(whirring)

40:43.100 --> 40:45.800
I TOLD HER I COULD DRAW
WITH AN Etch A Sketch.

40:45.833 --> 40:48.700
OF ALL THE THINGS
I COULD'VE CHOSEN, I--

40:48.733 --> 40:51.600
NO WONDER SHE THINKS
I'M PATHETIC.

40:51.633 --> 40:55.633
***

40:55.667 --> 40:57.767
I SAW YOUR TRANSPLANT TODAY.

40:57.800 --> 40:59.333
I KNOW.

40:59.367 --> 41:01.800
YOU HAVE
EXTRAORDINARY TECHNIQUE.
I KNOW.

41:01.833 --> 41:04.033
CAN I BUY YOU A DRINK?

41:04.067 --> 41:05.433
I HAVE, UH,

41:05.467 --> 41:08.200
RATHER EXTRAORDINARY TECHNIQUES
MYSELF.

41:08.233 --> 41:10.133
***

41:10.167 --> 41:11.500
YOU'RE NOT ATTRACTED TO ME.

41:11.533 --> 41:13.833
YOU THINK YOU ARE,
BUT YOU'RE NOT.

41:13.867 --> 41:16.667
YOU'RE ATTRACTED TO MY SKILL
AND MY CONFIDENCE

41:16.700 --> 41:19.767
AND MAYBE HOW HOT I LOOK
WITH MY HANDS ON A HEART.

41:19.800 --> 41:22.233
BUT MOSTLY,
YOU'RE ATTRACTED TO ME

41:22.267 --> 41:24.367
BECAUSE I'M NOT ATTRACTED
TO YOU.

41:24.400 --> 41:27.133
***

41:27.167 --> 41:30.067
I TOLD HER I COULDN'T
SEE HER ANYMORE.

41:30.100 --> 41:32.200
YOU DID?

41:32.233 --> 41:35.600
WHATEVER. I DON'T NEED
ANOTHER CHICK WITH ISSUES.

41:35.633 --> 41:37.433
THANK YOU.

41:37.467 --> 41:40.133
(cracks peanut shell)

41:40.167 --> 41:43.167

41:44.700 --> 41:47.167
ALEX...

41:47.200 --> 41:49.200
WILL YOU TAKE
MY SISTER HOME?

41:49.233 --> 41:51.133
COME ON,
SHE PLAYS THE TROMBONE

41:51.167 --> 41:53.200
AND WHATEVER.

41:53.233 --> 41:56.233
JUST TAKE HER HOME, PLEASE.

41:56.267 --> 41:59.300
***

42:04.667 --> 42:07.667

42:17.500 --> 42:20.500
***

42:26.500 --> 42:29.500
***

42:29.533 --> 42:32.700
I MARRIED ADELE
TWO YEARS OUT OF COLLEGE.

42:32.733 --> 42:36.533
THERE'S A LOT I NEED TO LEARN
TO DO FOR MYSELF.

42:36.567 --> 42:39.567
***

42:41.267 --> 42:43.800
(sighs)

42:43.833 --> 42:48.167
JUST PICK UP YOUR OWN SHIRTS
FROM NOW ON.

42:48.200 --> 42:49.467
(chuckles)

42:49.500 --> 42:51.400
***

42:51.433 --> 42:53.533
"TAXI DRIVER"?

42:53.567 --> 42:55.267
MEREDITH IS COMING OVER.

42:55.300 --> 42:57.200
AH. BETTER GET BACK
TO MY TRAILER.

42:57.233 --> 42:59.467
(chuckles)

42:59.500 --> 43:03.833

43:35.100 --> 43:37.133
YES, SIR.

43:37.167 --> 43:40.500
ALL RIGHT, WELL, DON'T WANT
TO INTERRUPT YOU TWO.

43:40.533 --> 43:43.267
WAIT, DAD, YOU'RE GOING OUT?
JUST DOWN TO THE STORE.

43:43.300 --> 43:44.300
DAD.

43:44.333 --> 43:47.267
IT'S JUST DOWN TO THE STORE,
LEXIE.

43:47.300 --> 43:49.200
UH, WHY DON'T I GO?

43:49.233 --> 43:51.500
YOU KNOW, MY CAR,

***

44:11.700 --> 44:14.133
UH...

44:14.167 --> 44:18.367

44:18.400 --> 44:22.467
***

44:24.733 --> 44:26.633
WHAT DID YOU DO TONIGHT?

44:26.667 --> 44:28.100
NOTHING.

44:28.133 --> 44:29.767
YOU?

44:29.800 --> 44:31.700
NOTHING.

44:31.733 --> 44:33.233
IT'S LATE.

44:33.267 --> 44:35.500
SHOULDN'T YOU
BE GOING SOON?

44:35.533 --> 44:39.567
I JUST WANT TO LIE HERE

44:49.667 --> 44:51.567
(chuckles)

44:51.600 --> 44:52.667
FINALLY.

44:52.700 --> 44:54.600
SEE? I KNEW
WE HAD IT IN US.

44:54.633 --> 44:57.567
(sighs) THAT WAS
AS GOOD AS THE FIRST TIME.

44:57.600 --> 44:59.667
NO, IT WAS BETTER.

44:59.700 --> 45:00.633
(chuckles)

45:00.667 --> 45:02.300
WAY BETTER.

45:02.333 --> 45:03.533

AND...
THAT WAS JUST...

45:09.100 --> 45:10.333
INCREDIBLE.

45:10.367 --> 45:13.633
