WEBVTT

00:06.919 --> 00:09.183
Ooh, sorry about that.
Late night, early morning.

00:09.183 --> 00:12.403
By the time I checked the--

00:12.403 --> 00:14.753
you okay?

00:14.753 --> 00:17.017
Today's guest is--
is a dear friend.

00:19.367 --> 00:20.063
Precious cargo.

00:24.502 --> 00:26.809
Is this our guest?

00:26.809 --> 00:28.724
Joy Summers.

00:28.724 --> 00:31.248
She asked me to fulfill
a very special fantasy.

00:32.684 --> 00:34.817
Her last.

01:20.384 --> 01:22.952
For luck on your new journey.

01:22.952 --> 01:24.910
Thank you, Segundo.

01:24.910 --> 01:27.739
How do you feel, Elena?

01:27.739 --> 01:29.828
Like I've been pushed
to the center of the stage

01:29.828 --> 01:31.830
and nobody has told me
what the play is.

01:31.830 --> 01:34.790
Wow. Come on.

01:34.790 --> 01:38.359
Let's not keep
your first guest waiting, hmm?

01:58.466 --> 02:00.163
Okay.

02:00.163 --> 02:02.818
Let your instincts guide you.

02:02.818 --> 02:05.734
It's all in your heart,

02:05.734 --> 02:08.302
and no one has
a better heart than you.

02:08.302 --> 02:11.653
Your uncle knew that.

02:11.653 --> 02:14.395
Filling his shoes is much
easier said than done, Segundo.

02:14.395 --> 02:18.268
Mi amor, you just have
to fill your shoes.

02:19.878 --> 02:23.360
Trust the Island.

02:23.360 --> 02:25.232
Look. The plane.

02:28.452 --> 02:29.845
Go.

02:29.845 --> 02:32.804
A big smile, eh?

02:32.804 --> 02:35.024
Like that. Yes.

02:46.253 --> 02:47.776
Good luck.

02:57.264 --> 03:00.136
Welcome to Fantasy Island.
I'm Elena Roarke.

03:00.136 --> 03:01.833
I'm your host.
You must be Joy Summers.

03:01.833 --> 03:03.270
Yeah.

03:03.270 --> 03:05.837
I see you've met
our pilot, Cora.

03:05.837 --> 03:08.100
Ah, thank you, Cora.

03:08.100 --> 03:11.016
Real ray of sunshine,
that one, huh?

03:11.016 --> 03:14.585
Oh, this place, it's beautiful.

03:14.585 --> 03:15.978
And you get to call it home.

03:15.978 --> 03:17.719
I do now. Yes.

03:20.330 --> 03:25.857
Wild hibiscus. Perfection.
Just like you.

03:25.857 --> 03:28.686
Perhaps I'll put it in my hair
so people can tell us apart.

03:30.384 --> 03:33.038
- Come on.
- Aw.

03:33.038 --> 03:35.476
Where do we go first?

03:35.476 --> 03:38.087
Not quite sure where to start.

03:38.087 --> 03:39.436
How about at the beginning?

03:39.436 --> 03:42.744
Well, I was born
at a very early age.

03:42.744 --> 03:44.659
And sometime after that,

03:44.659 --> 03:49.403
I started dreaming
of building an empire.

03:49.403 --> 03:52.101
You know, something that would
make the world a better place.

03:52.101 --> 03:53.885
And what stopped you?

03:53.885 --> 03:57.585
Guy with a killer smile I met
in business school.

03:57.585 --> 04:00.109
Before I had a chance
to really think it through,

04:00.109 --> 04:02.851
I started building a family
instead of an empire.

04:02.851 --> 04:06.811
They say life is what happens
while we're making other plans.

04:06.811 --> 04:09.205
Those other plans didn't
include guy with a killer smile

04:09.205 --> 04:10.946
leaving me when
my youngest was a toddler.

04:10.946 --> 04:13.340
- Oh, no.
- We're fine now.

04:13.340 --> 04:17.866
My older boys, Ross and Frank,
they're just out of college.

04:17.866 --> 04:21.913
And Bridge--Bridget--is 15,

04:21.913 --> 04:24.829
and she's thriving.

04:27.397 --> 04:31.096
Although sometimes I wonder
what might have been.

04:31.096 --> 04:32.924
Couldn't it still be?

04:32.924 --> 04:36.493
No, I'm 54 years old.

04:36.493 --> 04:39.322
Some doors close,
and they never reopen.

04:39.322 --> 04:41.237
I just--I have to accept that.

04:41.237 --> 04:43.935
Well, perhaps you shouldn't.

04:43.935 --> 04:49.071
No, I know what I can
and can't do.

04:49.071 --> 04:51.552
I'm just being realistic.

04:51.552 --> 04:55.512
- And your fantasy?
- Oh, right.

04:55.512 --> 04:58.907
Well, um...

04:58.907 --> 05:01.779
My name is Joy,

05:01.779 --> 05:06.610
but somewhere along the way,
I seem to have lost my--

05:06.610 --> 05:08.960
I was so focused
on my kids' happiness

05:08.960 --> 05:13.400
that I completely forgot
about my own.

05:13.400 --> 05:16.664
So my fantasy
is to find my joy.

05:19.014 --> 05:22.539
Something that will last.

05:22.539 --> 05:24.367
Can you help me with that?

05:24.367 --> 05:28.328
Yeah, of course. No problem.

05:28.328 --> 05:31.809
Right.
When do we get started?

05:31.809 --> 05:33.028
Soon enough, you know,

05:33.028 --> 05:34.812
but I want you
to first get unpacked

05:34.812 --> 05:37.162
and then get
a good night's sleep.

05:37.162 --> 05:40.340
And then tomorrow,
the adventure begins.

05:44.256 --> 05:45.606
Elena, can I ask you
a question?

05:45.606 --> 05:47.303
Yeah.

05:47.303 --> 05:51.655
I look around at this room,
and then I look at you,

05:51.655 --> 05:55.877
and something
doesn't quite match up.

05:55.877 --> 05:58.967
Okay, the truth is,

05:58.967 --> 06:02.840
I have a long and deep
connection to this island.

06:02.840 --> 06:04.755
I'm somewhat new to this job.

06:07.758 --> 06:11.240
- How new?
- Very, very, very, very new.

06:11.240 --> 06:12.546
You're my first guest.

06:12.546 --> 06:16.114
And I hope
that's not a concern.

06:16.114 --> 06:20.118
Elena, I have known you
all of what, 15 minutes?

06:20.118 --> 06:22.599
And I have
complete faith in you.

06:24.471 --> 06:27.822
Besides, you always
remember your first, right?

06:27.822 --> 06:30.128
Yes.

06:42.140 --> 06:43.881
I'm sorry for your loss.

06:43.881 --> 06:49.626
Your mother was a dear friend,
and she loved you all so much.

06:53.064 --> 06:56.981
- Is that our mom?
- It is, yeah.

06:56.981 --> 06:58.809
Guys, welcome.

06:58.809 --> 07:00.724
I'm Elena Roarke.
This is my associate, Ruby.

07:00.724 --> 07:02.465
- Pleased to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too.

07:02.465 --> 07:03.901
I'm Ross Summers.

07:03.901 --> 07:06.034
This is my brother, Frank,
and my sister, Bridge.

07:06.034 --> 07:08.384
And none of us really know
why we're here.

07:08.384 --> 07:10.255
And we don't recall
our mother

07:10.255 --> 07:12.606
ever mentioning you
or this island.

07:12.606 --> 07:14.259
I believe that,

07:14.259 --> 07:15.696
but if you just give me
a moment to explain, I can--

07:15.696 --> 07:17.480
Yeah, my time is actually
extremely limited.

07:17.480 --> 07:19.264
Extremely.

07:19.264 --> 07:21.223
Ross here is huge in the world
of foreign currency arbitrage,

07:21.223 --> 07:23.268
blibidi blih, blibidi blah.

07:23.268 --> 07:25.923
I do have a successful
career, which makes one of us.

07:25.923 --> 07:28.622
And most people like me,
which makes one of us.

07:28.622 --> 07:30.275
We're guessing that all
of this has something to do

07:30.275 --> 07:31.973
with our mother's business.

07:31.973 --> 07:33.409
Over the past 10 years,
Joy Summers

07:33.409 --> 07:35.672
built a multimillion
dollar company from scratch.

07:35.672 --> 07:37.065
Wow.

07:37.065 --> 07:39.937
Well, what a special legacy
for you three.

07:39.937 --> 07:41.852
It would be if these two
weren't set on,

07:41.852 --> 07:43.288
you know, selling it off.

07:43.288 --> 07:44.986
It's that what
your mother wanted?

07:44.986 --> 07:46.422
She never actually said.

07:46.422 --> 07:47.902
Our mom held most things
about her business

07:47.902 --> 07:49.860
tighter than the recipe
to Coca-Cola.

07:49.860 --> 07:51.122
You know, when I first met
your mother,

07:51.122 --> 07:55.170
we had a lot
of similar self-doubts.

07:55.170 --> 07:58.869
My job is helping people,
but your mother, she helped me.

07:58.869 --> 08:01.176
And to be honest, without her,

08:01.176 --> 08:03.091
I don't think
that I would be here today.

08:03.091 --> 08:05.572
On this island, we make
fantasies become reality.

08:05.572 --> 08:06.964
And when your mom understood--

08:06.964 --> 08:09.576
when she realized
how ill she was--

08:09.576 --> 08:13.231
she asked me to fulfill
her last fantasy:

08:13.231 --> 08:16.844
for the three of you
to spread her ashes together.

08:16.844 --> 08:18.933
- That's all you need from us?
- That's it.

08:18.933 --> 08:20.674
Yeah, but there's a--

08:20.674 --> 08:23.111
Okay, well, then as much as
I would love to sit around here

08:23.111 --> 08:26.027
and take in the beautiful
sights, given current company.

08:26.027 --> 08:28.769
Uh, agreed.
Let's not prolong this.

08:30.597 --> 08:33.600
I'm just gonna--hi, Mom.

08:33.600 --> 08:35.906
- Thank you both.
- Nice pen.

08:35.906 --> 08:38.953
Thank you for honoring
my mother's wish.

08:42.870 --> 08:44.175
Hmm.

08:53.533 --> 08:54.751
I'll go first.

09:00.844 --> 09:05.327
Mom, there are no words

09:05.327 --> 09:08.939
to express how much I love you

09:08.939 --> 09:11.159
and always will.

09:11.159 --> 09:13.465
I'll miss you every day.

09:13.465 --> 09:18.166
Mostly, I'll miss
the beautiful little things,

09:18.166 --> 09:21.691
the cute little cat face that
you'd draw on our lunch bags

09:21.691 --> 09:23.214
or the silly little rhymes
you'd make up

09:23.214 --> 09:26.000
and sing to us in the car and--

09:26.000 --> 09:28.829
- What?
- It's nothing.

09:28.829 --> 09:30.831
I was gonna just mention
the silly rhymes. Go ahead.

09:30.831 --> 09:32.093
There's, like,
a million other things

09:32.093 --> 09:34.312
you can mention, Ross.

09:34.312 --> 09:35.749
You know what? No, forget it.
Forget it.

09:35.749 --> 09:37.185
I couldn't even
get through this

09:37.185 --> 09:39.100
without you two figuring out
a way to spoil it?

09:39.100 --> 09:41.624
Spread Mom's ashes.
I love you, Mom.

09:47.674 --> 09:50.459
- Just give it to me.
- Okay. Yeah.

09:50.459 --> 09:51.765
Knock yourself out.

09:55.116 --> 09:58.336
Apologies for interrupting,
but I wanted to add

09:58.336 --> 10:00.121
that your mom's fantasy
was for you guys

10:00.121 --> 10:06.910
to spread her ashes in a spirit
of mutual love and respect.

10:06.910 --> 10:09.217
Until then, the urn is not
gonna open.

10:09.217 --> 10:12.916
- You mean like magic?
- Something like that.

10:12.916 --> 10:15.919
Okay, yeah, that's not gonna
work for me at all.

10:15.919 --> 10:17.138
Oh, okay.

10:17.138 --> 10:19.793
Well, while you guys
work things out,

10:19.793 --> 10:23.274
feel free to enjoy
the resort's many amenities.

10:23.274 --> 10:27.104
Well, like we're gonna solve
30 years of familial warfare

10:27.104 --> 10:29.280
over piña coladas?

10:29.280 --> 10:30.717
Really?
- What?

10:30.717 --> 10:32.544
I need, like, a pair
of pliers or something.

10:32.544 --> 10:34.155
Well, you heard her, Ross.
That's not gonna help.

10:34.155 --> 10:37.898
- I can't stay here forever.
- Hey, "GQ."

10:37.898 --> 10:39.551
You still got
your private pilot's license?

10:43.338 --> 10:46.820
No. No, no, no, no, no, no.
No. No.

10:46.820 --> 10:48.473
This is a bad--
Ross, give me Mom.

10:50.998 --> 10:52.913
- Hey, you hear that?
- Sounds like a plane.

10:52.913 --> 10:55.176
Yeah, my plane.
Somebody stole my plane.

10:55.176 --> 10:58.135
- Oh, he won't go far.
- Won't go far?

10:58.135 --> 11:00.311
Base to Fantasy One,
what the hell is going on?

11:00.311 --> 11:01.573
<i>Mayday. Mayday.</i>

11:01.573 --> 11:03.401
<i>I've lost control
of the aircraft.</i>

11:03.401 --> 11:05.839
Not to worry, Javi.
All is well that ends well.

11:05.839 --> 11:07.928
What?

11:12.062 --> 11:14.804
Oh, no.

11:14.804 --> 11:16.719
It's not doing
what I'm telling it.

11:16.719 --> 11:18.373
Oh, great job, Ross!
We're all gonna die!

11:18.373 --> 11:19.766
Tell him what to do!

11:37.479 --> 11:39.699
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

11:43.790 --> 11:45.008
There's salt water
in my mouth,

11:45.008 --> 11:46.227
and it's the best thing
I've ever tasted

11:46.227 --> 11:47.532
because I am alive!

11:47.532 --> 11:49.143
No thanks to Ross!

11:49.143 --> 11:51.580
The plane wouldn't do
what I told it to do!

11:51.580 --> 11:53.364
Oh, well, why didn't you use
that condescending tone

11:53.364 --> 11:55.279
that works so well
for you on the ground?

11:55.279 --> 11:56.803
- Either of you wanna survive?
- You really couldn't have

11:56.803 --> 11:58.674
asked us that
before we flew with you?

11:58.674 --> 12:00.894
The resort's
north-northwest of here.

12:00.894 --> 12:02.112
If we start walking now,

12:02.112 --> 12:03.984
we'll get there
just after sunset.

12:03.984 --> 12:05.246
- Oh, that's a great idea.
- Thank you.

12:05.246 --> 12:08.249
No, I was--I was
being sarcastic.

12:08.249 --> 12:10.425
It's a totally
fricking insane idea.

12:10.425 --> 12:12.122
Do either of you
have a better idea?

12:12.122 --> 12:13.994
No, but I can still hate it
'cause you came up with it.

12:13.994 --> 12:16.561
Frank, you get the urn. Okay?

12:16.561 --> 12:17.954
From now on,
it's your responsibility.

12:17.954 --> 12:19.434
Oh, of course it is.

12:19.434 --> 12:22.611
Just like taking care of Mom
was my responsibility

12:22.611 --> 12:25.005
while you were holding down
the fort in Beijing.

12:25.005 --> 12:27.790
All I'm saying is that
if we get lost in there,

12:27.790 --> 12:29.139
it is on you.

12:29.139 --> 12:30.619
You're not gonna find a way
to blame

12:30.619 --> 12:32.316
everything on me
like you always do.

12:35.537 --> 12:38.975
Ross the Boss strikes again.

12:43.501 --> 12:47.810
Wow. Just wow.

12:47.810 --> 12:52.075
I do not know where you learn
to do what you do,

12:52.075 --> 12:55.600
but you must have graduated
at the top of your class.

13:02.303 --> 13:04.000
It's incredible.

13:04.000 --> 13:05.523
What?

13:05.523 --> 13:08.657
How you know how to press
every one of my buttons,

13:08.657 --> 13:12.095
and I don't even know
the first thing about you.

13:12.095 --> 13:14.968
You know everything
you need to.

13:14.968 --> 13:18.058
So mysterious.

13:18.058 --> 13:23.193
But I wanna spend time
with you out in the world.

13:23.193 --> 13:25.630
Mm-mm.

13:28.895 --> 13:33.769
- Why not?
- Maybe sometime.

13:33.769 --> 13:36.119
Tonight after I'm done
with work,

13:36.119 --> 13:38.905
I'll go to the beach bar,
I'll buy drinks,

13:38.905 --> 13:42.691
we'll share our stories,
and we'll just be together.

13:54.485 --> 13:56.052
Okay. Let's see.

14:00.187 --> 14:02.450
Couldn't sleep, either?

14:02.450 --> 14:06.019
Who can sleep the night
before their fantasy?

14:06.019 --> 14:07.803
What's your excuse?

14:07.803 --> 14:10.023
I started redecorating
my office.

14:10.023 --> 14:11.763
I couldn't spend
one more second

14:11.763 --> 14:15.028
staring at tusks and daggers.

14:15.028 --> 14:17.073
What's on the menu?

14:17.073 --> 14:22.252
Well, when I can't sleep,
I make truffles.

14:22.252 --> 14:26.256
So tonight, I thought that
I would try three new flavors.

14:26.256 --> 14:30.695
Lemon cream, lime coconut,
and hazelnut ganache.

14:30.695 --> 14:33.742
- That's yummy.
- If you have the ingredients.

14:33.742 --> 14:36.179
Oh, we have the ingredients.

14:36.179 --> 14:37.267
How do you know?

14:37.267 --> 14:38.703
We have the ingredients.

14:49.062 --> 14:51.499
It's as if they knew
I'd be here.

14:51.499 --> 14:56.069
Am I wrong thinking that
making truffles brings you joy?

14:56.069 --> 14:58.854
- It's just a silly hobby.
- Hmm. I see.

14:58.854 --> 15:01.161
What about you?

15:01.161 --> 15:04.164
Who redecorates
in the middle of the night?

15:04.164 --> 15:06.383
First day on the job jitters,
I suppose.

15:08.168 --> 15:12.085
When I say you got this,
you got this.

15:22.617 --> 15:26.229
I gotta take a break.
I gotta do it.

15:26.229 --> 15:27.665
Oh, what did it, Bridge?

15:27.665 --> 15:29.667
Was it the first 50 feet
or the second?

15:29.667 --> 15:31.800
You wanna try walking
in my platform sandals?

15:31.800 --> 15:33.410
Well, at this rate,
you're gonna be spreading

15:33.410 --> 15:35.108
my ashes on this beach.

15:35.108 --> 15:37.327
If either of you want to get
back to civilization,

15:37.327 --> 15:38.938
I'm gonna need
a serious attitude change.

15:38.938 --> 15:40.765
That's all you need, Ross?

15:40.765 --> 15:42.115
Because Bridge and I,

15:42.115 --> 15:43.943
we'd rather feed ourselves
to the crabs

15:43.943 --> 15:45.466
than have you lecturing us.

15:45.466 --> 15:46.858
Or have you tell me

15:46.858 --> 15:48.860
one more time how
your being here is my fault.

15:53.561 --> 15:57.478
You pushed me to come here
when I didn't want to...

15:57.478 --> 15:59.567
Nicky.

15:59.567 --> 16:02.483
Did you seriously
just call me Nicky?

16:02.483 --> 16:05.486
Never do that again ever.
- God. Chill out. Would you?

16:05.486 --> 16:07.488
And you know what, Frank?

16:07.488 --> 16:09.185
If you don't want to follow
my lead anymore, that's fine.

16:09.185 --> 16:11.492
I officially resign
from being in charge.

16:11.492 --> 16:15.235
You can't resign from it
because we never hired you.

16:15.235 --> 16:18.455
All our lives, you've been
putting yourself in charge.

16:18.455 --> 16:20.196
We haven't asked you
to do that once.

16:21.850 --> 16:24.026
Oh, my God, please.

16:24.026 --> 16:26.376
For the love of all that
is holy, please,

16:26.376 --> 16:29.031
please rescue us.
Or at least just me.

16:29.031 --> 16:30.990
The three of you
stole a plane.

16:30.990 --> 16:33.601
Where are the apologies?
- Uh, I got one.

16:33.601 --> 16:36.038
I am so sorry that my brother
is the world's worst pilot.

16:36.038 --> 16:37.387
It didn't do
what I was telling it to.

16:37.387 --> 16:38.823
Oh, enough already, Ross.

16:38.823 --> 16:40.173
If you're gonna act
like children,

16:40.173 --> 16:42.088
you deserve to be treated
like children.

16:42.088 --> 16:43.524
What does that mean?
What are we talking?

16:43.524 --> 16:47.049
Like, warm milk and cookies
or bed without supper?

16:47.049 --> 16:49.269
I'm gonna do exactly
what your mother would do

16:49.269 --> 16:50.661
if she was here.

16:50.661 --> 16:52.924
Give you all a timeout.

17:00.802 --> 17:03.413
Is this for real?

17:03.413 --> 17:06.068
It's our rec room from
our house on Stratford Road.

17:06.068 --> 17:09.289
My old Ping-Pong table!
And the Nerf basketball hoop?

17:09.289 --> 17:12.074
The old Toshiba and the VCR.

17:12.074 --> 17:15.556
Couch where I made out
with Kathy Gable.

17:15.556 --> 17:17.949
- You guys.
- Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots.

17:17.949 --> 17:19.995
Everything is exactly the same.

17:19.995 --> 17:22.345
- Except for one thing.
- What?

17:22.345 --> 17:25.174
The door. It's gone.

17:37.447 --> 17:40.494
It's a basement.
Frank, there's no trap door.

17:40.494 --> 17:43.192
All right, whatever.
I give up. All right, look.

17:43.192 --> 17:45.499
I know you're waiting for us
to ask it, so here it is.

17:45.499 --> 17:47.501
What do you suggest we do?

17:47.501 --> 17:49.416
Oh, now you want my help.

17:49.416 --> 17:52.332
If it's gonna help us get out
of here faster, then yeah.

17:52.332 --> 17:55.857
Oh, thanks for the vote
of confidence, Nicky.

17:55.857 --> 17:57.554
Ow!

17:57.554 --> 17:59.556
Guys.

17:59.556 --> 18:02.733
Maybe this is like the
escape room that I did once.

18:02.733 --> 18:05.823
All the clues, they were
scattered in random places.

18:05.823 --> 18:08.913
You know, I'm so tired of
being judged by the two of you.

18:08.913 --> 18:11.568
I did not want to take charge
when Dad left.

18:11.568 --> 18:14.484
All right? But somebody had to.
- No, Mom was in charge.

18:14.484 --> 18:16.356
It just made you feel better
to be all chest thumping.

18:16.356 --> 18:18.923
Yeah, it made you feel better
after college

18:18.923 --> 18:20.186
to move as far away from us
as you possibly could.

18:20.186 --> 18:21.404
Mm-hmm.

18:21.404 --> 18:23.102
Tokyo is where my career
took me.

18:23.102 --> 18:24.625
And when Mom got sick,

18:24.625 --> 18:26.235
you left us
to handle everything.

18:26.235 --> 18:28.498
You came home two days
before she died.

18:28.498 --> 18:29.804
And you're one to talk.

18:29.804 --> 18:32.241
You're off the grid for what,
two years?

18:32.241 --> 18:33.721
What was the name
of that commune?

18:33.721 --> 18:36.289
It was a utopian community,
and its name was

18:36.289 --> 18:37.725
Bite Me You Self-Righteous
Douche Canoe.

18:37.725 --> 18:40.380
Hey, guys, check this out.

18:43.034 --> 18:46.299
Says, "For Ross, Francis,
and Bridget.

18:46.299 --> 18:47.561
Love, Mom."

18:58.789 --> 19:01.227
<i>Okay. Is this on?</i>

19:01.227 --> 19:03.577
<i>I think it's--</i>

19:03.577 --> 19:06.884
<i>I think it's recording.</i>

19:06.884 --> 19:10.323
Oh, this is really hard.

19:10.323 --> 19:14.544
<i>If the three of you
are watching this,</i>

19:14.544 --> 19:18.244
<i>then I am really gone,</i>

19:18.244 --> 19:21.290
<i>and you're there with Elena.</i>

19:21.290 --> 19:23.945
<i>It would take me forever
to list the ways</i>

19:23.945 --> 19:26.426
<i>that I love each of you.</i>

19:26.426 --> 19:31.866
<i>Ross, you can do anything.
You've always been like that.</i>

19:31.866 --> 19:34.042
<i>So determined.</i>

19:34.042 --> 19:38.655
<i>And Frank, you can
make me laugh even now.</i>

19:38.655 --> 19:41.832
<i>You were the best person
to take care of me.</i>

19:41.832 --> 19:47.098
<i>Bridget, my baby,
I'm so proud of you.</i>

19:47.098 --> 19:49.666
<i>Keep telling your truth</i>

19:49.666 --> 19:52.495
<i>even when it's hard.</i>

19:52.495 --> 19:56.499
<i>I know the three of you fight.
You always have.</i>

19:56.499 --> 19:58.762
<i>You're probably
bickering right now</i>

19:58.762 --> 20:02.157
<i>about the fact that
you couldn't get the urn open.</i>

20:02.157 --> 20:05.465
<i>Arguments come and go.
But love doesn't.</i>

20:05.465 --> 20:07.728
<i>Ross, I won't be there
to remind you</i>

20:07.728 --> 20:10.600
<i>how you'd stand
over Bridget's crib</i>

20:10.600 --> 20:13.516
<i>just to make sure that
she was still breathing.</i>

20:13.516 --> 20:16.302
<i>And Frank, how you were
always bragging about</i>

20:16.302 --> 20:19.348
<i>how Ross was the smartest kid
in school.</i>

20:19.348 --> 20:21.829
<i>And Bridget,
how you would always</i>

20:21.829 --> 20:23.265
<i>get into trouble on purpose</i>

20:23.265 --> 20:24.614
<i>so that you could
have a timeout</i>

20:24.614 --> 20:26.616
<i>with your big brothers
in the basement.</i>

20:29.184 --> 20:34.058
<i>Remember that you love
each other.</i>

20:34.058 --> 20:36.974
<i>Choose to be a family.</i>

20:36.974 --> 20:39.325
<i>With me gone,
it'll be easy for you</i>

20:39.325 --> 20:41.979
<i>to slip out
of each other's lives.</i>

20:41.979 --> 20:46.070
<i>Don't. Please.</i>

20:46.070 --> 20:47.420
<i>You need each other.</i>

20:49.770 --> 20:51.467
<i>I know you can get along.</i>

20:53.730 --> 20:54.862
<i>I've seen it.</i>

20:59.562 --> 21:03.131
<i>I love you all so, so much.</i>

21:13.184 --> 21:16.623
Do you really get
in trouble on purpose?

21:16.623 --> 21:18.059
Maybe.

21:20.583 --> 21:22.716
I miss her.

21:22.716 --> 21:24.370
So much.

21:26.763 --> 21:27.938
Me too.

21:37.078 --> 21:39.167
Hey, you believe this?

21:39.167 --> 21:41.343
Shredded fuel pump.

21:41.343 --> 21:43.258
Can you hand me that flathead?

21:43.258 --> 21:44.303
Yeah.

21:48.568 --> 21:51.484
There you go.

21:51.484 --> 21:53.747
Oh, man.

21:53.747 --> 21:56.576
So what's up?

21:56.576 --> 22:01.450
Oh, just wondering.

22:01.450 --> 22:03.626
You ever met someone
on the Island named Isla?

22:03.626 --> 22:05.280
Nope. Doesn't ring any bells.
Who is she?

22:05.280 --> 22:09.502
Um, a friend. Good friend.

22:09.502 --> 22:15.943
You know, close friend
but also kind of not.

22:15.943 --> 22:20.600
So you and Isla are close
but also kind of not?

22:20.600 --> 22:23.080
She gave me my tattoo,

22:23.080 --> 22:27.607
and we've been spending time
together, like, quality time.

22:27.607 --> 22:29.826
So you have feelings
for this Isla, huh?

22:29.826 --> 22:34.178
She's kind of everything.

22:34.178 --> 22:37.356
You know, like in a mysterious,
elusive kind of way.

22:37.356 --> 22:39.793
Oh, man. You have got it bad.

22:39.793 --> 22:43.797
I do not have it bad.

22:43.797 --> 22:49.498
But yes,
that there's some feelings.

22:49.498 --> 22:51.848
Right, and what does Elena
think of her?

22:51.848 --> 22:54.677
I haven't told her yet,
because--

22:54.677 --> 22:56.200
Uh-oh.

22:56.200 --> 22:57.985
You think Isla might be
bad news,

22:57.985 --> 23:00.204
and you don't want Elena
to tell you, "Be careful."

23:04.644 --> 23:05.514
Yeah.

23:08.430 --> 23:11.999
Elenita,
how are things going?

23:11.999 --> 23:13.043
Great.

23:15.872 --> 23:18.353
My guest expects her fantasy
to start this morning,

23:18.353 --> 23:20.877
and I was up all night,
Segundo, thinking and thinking

23:20.877 --> 23:24.315
and hoping that the way forward
would magically come to me.

23:24.315 --> 23:28.842
Have you considered
all the tools available to you?

23:28.842 --> 23:31.061
I don't feel ready
to use them, I don't know.

23:31.061 --> 23:35.936
Elena, your uncle never
would have chosen you

23:35.936 --> 23:38.155
if you weren't ready.

23:38.155 --> 23:39.200
Okay?

23:43.422 --> 23:46.120
Now go. I have work to do.

23:47.730 --> 23:49.297
Okay.

23:56.609 --> 23:58.959
Any idea
what's on the other side?

23:58.959 --> 24:01.135
Not a clue.

24:01.135 --> 24:02.745
How exciting is this?

24:02.745 --> 24:04.921
I have walked past this door

24:04.921 --> 24:06.836
I don't even know
how many times,

24:06.836 --> 24:08.969
but I have never
stepped through.

24:08.969 --> 24:11.188
Let's do it.

24:11.188 --> 24:14.104
Okay. Let's go find your joy.

24:45.484 --> 24:47.834
Two roads diverged
in a yellow wood.

24:47.834 --> 24:49.923
If I can only choose one,
what do you suggest?

24:49.923 --> 24:53.317
Um, okay, well,
which feels more like you?

24:53.317 --> 24:56.320
The basket or the machete?

24:56.320 --> 24:58.540
Are you kidding? The basket.

24:58.540 --> 25:00.673
Okay.

25:00.673 --> 25:03.719
All right. Wish me luck.
Here I go.

25:14.948 --> 25:16.602
You know, did it ever occur
to you, Bridge,

25:16.602 --> 25:21.041
that maybe doing your nails
in a room with no ventilation

25:21.041 --> 25:22.869
might be annoying the crap
out of me too?

25:22.869 --> 25:25.698
- Does it bother you?
- It's disgusting, Nicky.

25:25.698 --> 25:27.613
What the hell
is wrong with you?

25:27.613 --> 25:28.831
Dude, she's asked you, like,

25:28.831 --> 25:30.790
a million times
not to call her that.

25:30.790 --> 25:33.575
Yeah, it was cruel
and immature when you were 15.

25:33.575 --> 25:34.707
You're 34.

25:34.707 --> 25:36.056
How many times
did the both of you

25:36.056 --> 25:37.405
mock me with Ross the Boss?

25:37.405 --> 25:41.278
Yeah, but Nicky?
NCE--not cute enough?

25:41.278 --> 25:42.976
Who tells their little sister

25:42.976 --> 25:44.499
that she's just not
cute enough?

25:44.499 --> 25:45.805
And that was just for starters,
because you always--

25:45.805 --> 25:47.284
Hey, hey, hey.

25:47.284 --> 25:49.025
Look, he's an idiot.
Just don't engage--

25:49.025 --> 25:50.592
Oh, don't act like
you weren't a part of it too.

25:50.592 --> 25:52.028
Always telling me that
if I were better

25:52.028 --> 25:55.031
or more special or different,
Dad wouldn't have left?

25:55.031 --> 25:58.426
You know, the only reason
Mom and Dad even had you

25:58.426 --> 26:01.516
was to try to save
their failed marriage.

26:01.516 --> 26:03.039
Ugh!

26:03.039 --> 26:05.302
Only people whose marriages
are already a disaster

26:05.302 --> 26:07.000
have kids to try and save them!
Stop!

26:07.000 --> 26:10.525
Can we just move beyond this?
It's all ancient history.

26:10.525 --> 26:12.309
No, it's not, not for me.

26:12.309 --> 26:15.269
I'm never, never forgiving
either of you for that.

26:15.269 --> 26:18.011
<i>This is so disappointing.</i>

26:18.011 --> 26:19.316
<i>It's like
your mother's message</i>

26:19.316 --> 26:21.492
<i>had no impact on any of you.</i>

26:21.492 --> 26:23.190
Why?
Why are you doing this to us?

26:23.190 --> 26:24.408
<i>Well, I was hoping
you might unite</i>

26:24.408 --> 26:26.280
<i>if only to find your way out.</i>

26:26.280 --> 26:29.196
<i>I think I know
what the problem is.</i>

26:29.196 --> 26:30.327
<i>You need more motivation.</i>

26:30.327 --> 26:33.330
- What?
- Guys, floor is lava.

26:33.330 --> 26:34.897
Oh, my God!

26:34.897 --> 26:36.246
Oh, God! Oh! Okay!

26:44.472 --> 26:46.822
Baby Bridge
has got the hiccups,

26:46.822 --> 26:50.521
and we don't know what to do.

26:50.521 --> 26:56.136
She's bouncing up and down
like a baby kangaroo.

27:01.228 --> 27:05.101
Maybe we should jump out
of the closet shouting boo.

27:12.152 --> 27:13.675
- Can I have another one?
- Of course.

27:13.675 --> 27:15.634
Thanks.

27:15.634 --> 27:17.723
- Hi.
- Hey.

27:17.723 --> 27:19.942
Took enough food
for Helene and me.

27:19.942 --> 27:22.031
Little father-daughter picnic
on the beach.

27:22.031 --> 27:26.383
- Aww, that makes me so happy.
- And you?

27:26.383 --> 27:27.863
Waiting for Ms. Right?

27:27.863 --> 27:32.041
Huh. I thought I was.

27:32.041 --> 27:34.696
I mean, she's running late.
Give her a call.

27:34.696 --> 27:38.178
Hmm, well, I don't actually
have a number for her.

27:38.178 --> 27:40.180
Not even sure
if she has a phone.

27:40.180 --> 27:43.139
You know, we usually just run
into each other on the beach,

27:43.139 --> 27:45.838
and then, uh, well, you--

27:45.838 --> 27:48.884
- Oh. Okay, then.
- There you go.

27:48.884 --> 27:52.671
She is just
such a free spirit.

27:52.671 --> 27:55.761
Careful.
This is Fantasy Island.

27:55.761 --> 27:58.415
Everyone and everything
aren't always what they seem.

28:09.992 --> 28:12.560
Oh, my--

28:16.216 --> 28:18.827
What could be more me
than coming to Fantasy Island

28:18.827 --> 28:21.221
to find joy and ending up
with a basket

28:21.221 --> 28:24.180
full of dirty sweat socks
and fast food wrappers

28:24.180 --> 28:27.009
and everything else my kids
dropped along the way?

28:27.009 --> 28:29.142
Well, it was
certainly considerate

28:29.142 --> 28:32.885
to pick up the mess,
even selfless.

28:32.885 --> 28:36.105
Almost as if you felt
it was your obligation.

28:36.105 --> 28:37.498
Well, I couldn't just
leave it all there.

28:37.498 --> 28:38.934
Somebody had to do it.

28:38.934 --> 28:42.590
Believe me, I know
all about obligation.

28:42.590 --> 28:43.809
But I also know there are times

28:43.809 --> 28:47.203
when we carry more
than is required of us.

28:47.203 --> 28:49.989
Speaking of, I think you can
put all that stuff down now.

28:54.602 --> 28:56.343
Much better, isn't it?

29:02.218 --> 29:05.831
You know, the Island seems
to be offering you something

29:05.831 --> 29:08.137
that we don't often
get in life.

29:08.137 --> 29:10.313
This is a do-over.

29:10.313 --> 29:11.967
So what if this time,
you were to pick the machete?

29:11.967 --> 29:14.883
- Really? Machete?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Why not?

29:14.883 --> 29:17.407
'Cause I told you,
it's just--it's not me.

29:17.407 --> 29:18.931
I'm not a warrior.

29:18.931 --> 29:21.716
Joy, you raised three kids
on your own.

29:21.716 --> 29:23.500
I'd say you are
very much a warrior.

29:23.500 --> 29:25.720
You got a point.

29:25.720 --> 29:29.550
How's the machete
gonna help me find joy?

29:29.550 --> 29:31.160
I guess we'll see.

29:33.336 --> 29:36.035
You know, sometimes,
we have to embrace the options,

29:36.035 --> 29:38.820
you know, the tools
that are available to us.

29:41.997 --> 29:44.347
- The machete it is.
- Yes.

29:50.658 --> 29:53.748
Well, we have to come up
with a plan and fast.

29:53.748 --> 29:56.142
- The floor is lava.
- Uh-huh.

29:56.142 --> 29:57.447
We used to play this game
all the time

29:57.447 --> 29:58.971
when Bridge was little,
but we had a routine.

29:58.971 --> 30:00.711
Right, right, right, right.

30:00.711 --> 30:03.540
And it was--it was--it was
couch to coffee table to futon.

30:03.540 --> 30:05.064
No, no, it was couch
to coffee table to bean bag.

30:05.064 --> 30:06.848
No, no, no.
You're both wrong.

30:06.848 --> 30:09.329
It's couch to futon,
bean bag, baseball glove.

30:09.329 --> 30:11.113
- No, that's definitely not it.
- Oh, no, no. I'm telling you.

30:11.113 --> 30:15.248
Couch, futon, bean bag, glove.

30:15.248 --> 30:17.076
Oh, really?
Right now--right now

30:17.076 --> 30:18.207
is the first time that
you're gonna trust me ever?

30:18.207 --> 30:19.339
I mean what do
we have to lose?

30:19.339 --> 30:21.123
You look confident.

30:21.123 --> 30:22.081
But if this doesn't work,
you can't blame me.

30:22.081 --> 30:23.517
- Oh, that goes without saying.
- Right.

30:23.517 --> 30:24.779
Here goes nothing.

30:24.779 --> 30:26.825
Okay. Okay. Okay.

30:26.825 --> 30:28.609
Uh, okay, okay, okay, okay.

30:28.609 --> 30:32.352
- Focus.
- Okay.

30:35.137 --> 30:37.270
My favorite sandal's
in the other bag!

30:37.270 --> 30:39.446
- It's okay.
- Um. Okay.

30:39.446 --> 30:41.404
To get from the glove
to where the door

30:41.404 --> 30:45.495
is supposed to be was the, um,
the Summers' somersault.

30:45.495 --> 30:47.802
all: The somersault!
- Right. All right.

30:47.802 --> 30:50.022
But we bucket brigade
the cushions.

30:50.022 --> 30:51.893
Ross, get to the bean bag.
Go. Go. Go. Go.

30:51.893 --> 30:53.503
- Come on!
- Okay! Okay!

30:53.503 --> 30:55.636
Okay. Come on.

30:55.636 --> 30:58.247
Okay. Okay. Uh-huh.

30:58.247 --> 31:00.467
Okay. Okay.

31:00.467 --> 31:01.598
- Ready?
- Uh-huh.

31:01.598 --> 31:04.471
Okay. And go, go, go. Go.

31:06.168 --> 31:08.127
Okay. Okay.

31:08.127 --> 31:09.955
Over here. Come here.

31:09.955 --> 31:11.782
- Are you sure?
- Yes, yes, yes, yes.

31:11.782 --> 31:14.916
Okay. Okay. Okay.

31:18.311 --> 31:20.748
Guys, we were
a lot smaller back then.

31:20.748 --> 31:22.619
There is no way we're all
gonna fit on the glove.

31:22.619 --> 31:25.405
No, we will catch you.
We will catch you. Just jump.

31:25.405 --> 31:27.059
- Okay.
- Come on.

31:27.059 --> 31:29.148
Right here.

31:29.148 --> 31:32.760
- Oh! Oh! Oh!
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

31:32.760 --> 31:34.980
Okay! Okay.

31:37.896 --> 31:40.681
Time for the coup de grâce.

31:40.681 --> 31:42.074
The Summers' sault.

31:44.554 --> 31:46.905
- You got this, sis.
- I know.

31:54.825 --> 31:58.873
The Summers somersault
never fails!

31:58.873 --> 32:01.528
Oh, my God.

32:01.528 --> 32:04.574
- Where's Mom?
- What?

32:04.574 --> 32:07.577
- Oh, man.
- You left Mom?

32:07.577 --> 32:09.797
It all happened so fast.

32:09.797 --> 32:11.364
What?

32:11.364 --> 32:14.106
At least you can't blame me
for this one, right?

32:15.759 --> 32:19.938
You were responsible
for one thing, Frank.

32:21.765 --> 32:23.593
Frank!

32:23.593 --> 32:26.161
I've been lifting weights
for 12 years

32:26.161 --> 32:28.337
waiting for the day
I could kick your ass.

32:28.337 --> 32:30.252
Get up so I can do it again.

32:31.645 --> 32:33.777
Oh, my God!

32:33.777 --> 32:37.216
Real mature, you guys.
You're both in your 30s.

32:43.570 --> 32:46.660
Oh, Frank.
I think you broke my nose.

32:46.660 --> 32:49.619
Nose. Try my knuckles.
Your head is like a rock.

32:52.274 --> 32:56.235
- Are you done?
- No. Just round one.

32:56.235 --> 32:57.671
Look, if Mom was here,

32:57.671 --> 33:01.675
she would be ashamed
of all of us.

33:01.675 --> 33:03.198
Mom would be here
if Frank hadn't

33:03.198 --> 33:05.026
left her on the coffee table!

33:07.289 --> 33:09.726
Hey, where are you going?

33:09.726 --> 33:11.554
To get away from you two.

33:11.554 --> 33:15.515
Wait. No, no, no. Wait.
We gotta be miserable together.

33:15.515 --> 33:17.082
Ow.
- Wait.

33:17.082 --> 33:18.735
- Stop.
- Wait!

33:27.831 --> 33:28.876
Elena?

33:30.399 --> 33:32.401
Elena?

33:32.401 --> 33:34.751
I know you can
hear me right now,

33:34.751 --> 33:38.625
and at this moment, you are so
no longer my favorite person.

33:42.020 --> 33:45.588
All right. Let's do this.

33:45.588 --> 33:47.634
Okay.

33:47.634 --> 33:50.898
If anything is attached to me
when I get to the other side...

33:57.644 --> 33:59.298
Oh, crap.

34:02.562 --> 34:04.564
Hello, piranhas.

34:04.564 --> 34:07.871
Soup's on.
There's plenty for everyone.

34:21.624 --> 34:25.454
- Hey, Bridget.
- Hmm. What is it, Francis?

34:25.454 --> 34:28.022
Look, I'm sorry that I said

34:28.022 --> 34:31.808
that you were to blame
for Mom and Dad separating.

34:31.808 --> 34:34.333
Me too.

34:34.333 --> 34:37.727
It's an unbelievably
horrible thing to say to a kid.

34:37.727 --> 34:41.122
- Then why did you say it?
- I don't know.

34:41.122 --> 34:45.605
Maybe because as a teenager
hurting the way that we were,

34:45.605 --> 34:47.737
you just lay blame
anywhere you can.

34:47.737 --> 34:49.043
Yeah, except on Dad,

34:49.043 --> 34:51.524
who was the one
who actually abandoned us.

34:51.524 --> 34:55.180
Look, my teen years
were a minefield of regret,

34:55.180 --> 34:57.269
and I feel about a thousand
times worse about this

34:57.269 --> 34:59.706
than, you know, stealing money
from Mom's purse.

35:02.491 --> 35:05.233
Well, it would have been nice
to hear this

35:05.233 --> 35:10.369
from both of you 15 years ago,
but hey, better late.

35:14.547 --> 35:16.244
There you are.

35:16.244 --> 35:18.116
Do you have any idea
what I've just been doing?

35:18.116 --> 35:20.292
Yes. Joy, bravo. Well done.

35:20.292 --> 35:22.511
So much for what you can
and can't do.

35:22.511 --> 35:24.296
Now, tell me,
what do you feel exactly?

35:24.296 --> 35:26.385
And don't say irritated.

35:26.385 --> 35:29.953
Well, I guess

35:29.953 --> 35:32.565
I do feel powerful.

35:32.565 --> 35:34.044
Mm-hmm.

35:34.044 --> 35:35.350
- Fierce.
- Yes, I can see that.

35:35.350 --> 35:37.004
What else?

35:37.004 --> 35:40.573
- Maybe a little triumphant.
- You are.

35:40.573 --> 35:43.184
In other words?

35:43.184 --> 35:46.405
Joy. I'm Joy of the jungle.

35:46.405 --> 35:48.755
Yes. Come on.

35:51.366 --> 35:52.672
Oh!

35:52.672 --> 35:56.632
What is this?

35:56.632 --> 35:59.157
It's so beautiful.

35:59.157 --> 36:01.724
Oh, it's so beautiful. Oh.

36:06.599 --> 36:07.991
It's cacao?

36:07.991 --> 36:09.732
Mm-hmm.

36:14.737 --> 36:16.130
Cacao.

36:16.130 --> 36:19.220
It's chocolate, but this is...

36:19.220 --> 36:21.875
Ah!

36:21.875 --> 36:23.485
It's extraordinary.

36:33.756 --> 36:35.584
Hey, uh.

36:38.413 --> 36:42.156
If we're doing, uh,
apologies or whatever,

36:42.156 --> 36:44.898
I'm sorry that
I left everything

36:44.898 --> 36:48.771
to the two of you
during Mom's final months.

36:48.771 --> 36:52.514
Well, you know, it's probably
for the best, right?

36:52.514 --> 36:54.386
It would've been such a pain
having you around

36:54.386 --> 36:57.084
telling us what to do, so.

36:57.084 --> 37:00.305
That's true.

37:00.305 --> 37:03.264
And Frank, I'm sorry
I blew off your wedding.

37:03.264 --> 37:04.657
I'll come to the next one.

37:04.657 --> 37:06.485
- Oh.
- You know,

37:06.485 --> 37:07.442
if you can get someone else
to agree to marry you.

37:07.442 --> 37:08.835
Well, you know,
I was actually thinking

37:08.835 --> 37:10.402
about giving
Kathy Gable a call.

37:10.402 --> 37:12.491
Oh, really?
Well, you have my blessing.

37:12.491 --> 37:15.320
Hey, um,

37:15.320 --> 37:16.756
I know you were
just trying to step up

37:16.756 --> 37:18.845
when Dad left.

37:18.845 --> 37:21.848
We did not make it easy
for you.

37:21.848 --> 37:24.807
Well, I guess we also have
some growing up to do.

37:24.807 --> 37:27.114
Yeah.

37:27.114 --> 37:29.290
- You really do.
- We believe in you.

37:29.290 --> 37:30.900
- Yeah.
- Have you learned nothing?

37:30.900 --> 37:32.728
- No, we're flawless.
- We're totally perfect.

37:35.470 --> 37:38.908
Oh, look,
Mom's waiting for us.

37:38.908 --> 37:42.303
It is so nice to see
the Summers kids smiling.

37:48.831 --> 37:50.485
Should have held on
to my basket.

37:53.227 --> 37:54.750
<i>This place has been
the pride</i>

37:54.750 --> 37:58.363
<i>of the Island for generations.</i>

37:58.363 --> 38:00.103
Frank.

38:00.103 --> 38:02.454
<i>They're heavier than
you think you're gonna be too.</i>

38:04.238 --> 38:08.155
And Ross. Is that Bridget?
Oh, God. She's so grown up.

38:10.288 --> 38:13.465
And look at you.
So self-assured.

38:15.423 --> 38:17.947
<i>They don't smell
like chocolate.</i>

38:17.947 --> 38:20.167
<i>Think the chocolate's
inside, Ross.</i>

38:20.167 --> 38:22.822
- It's incredible.
- It's in the future?

38:22.822 --> 38:24.345
Yeah.

38:24.345 --> 38:27.740
That and what
I always dreamed of.

38:27.740 --> 38:29.132
They're just...

38:29.132 --> 38:31.961
<i>- Wow.</i>
- Getting along so well.

38:31.961 --> 38:34.790
So much joy.

38:34.790 --> 38:37.227
Well, you deserve the same.

38:37.227 --> 38:40.492
It's not too late.
It's your time.

38:40.492 --> 38:45.366
You know what? I agree.

38:45.366 --> 38:47.716
Enough of this being realistic.

38:47.716 --> 38:51.590
This joyful warrior knows
exactly what she's gonna do.

38:51.590 --> 38:54.636
- Build an empire?
- And you're gonna help.

39:03.950 --> 39:06.561
So these cacao seeds are
the secret to mom's truffles?

39:06.561 --> 39:08.302
The essential ingredient.

39:08.302 --> 39:10.957
Why didn't mom tell us about
any of this when she was alive?

39:10.957 --> 39:12.785
'Cause your mother know
that you wouldn't appreciate

39:12.785 --> 39:15.135
what it all meant
until this very moment.

39:17.659 --> 39:19.226
Now, if you guys agree...

39:21.489 --> 39:23.578
I think this is
the perfect place for her.

39:39.768 --> 39:42.336
You gotta hand it to Mom.

39:42.336 --> 39:43.555
She always knew.

39:49.691 --> 39:51.998
To Mom.

39:51.998 --> 39:53.608
both: To Mom.

40:17.066 --> 40:18.894
Are you mad?

40:18.894 --> 40:21.027
Less mad
the more you kiss me.

40:28.774 --> 40:32.168
Well, anticipation
has been killing me.

40:32.168 --> 40:33.735
I have made good truffles,

40:33.735 --> 40:36.172
and I have made
very good truffles,

40:36.172 --> 40:37.609
but these...

40:39.306 --> 40:42.440
Let me see. Let me see.

40:42.440 --> 40:45.878
Mmm! Perfect.

40:45.878 --> 40:47.532
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

40:47.532 --> 40:49.882
I can't be humble.
They are perfect.

40:49.882 --> 40:51.797
You did it.

40:51.797 --> 40:54.626
You found your joy--
the kind that lasts.

40:54.626 --> 40:56.323
Yeah.

40:56.323 --> 40:58.630
And not to diminish
my own contributions,

40:58.630 --> 41:02.242
but I couldn't have done it
without you.

41:02.242 --> 41:04.026
Thank you, Elena.

41:04.026 --> 41:05.506
Thank you.

41:05.506 --> 41:07.073
And we are in business
now together,

41:07.073 --> 41:09.118
so I'm gonna talk
to you very soon.

41:12.295 --> 41:13.427
Gonna miss you.

41:13.427 --> 41:16.909
Oh, I'm gonna
miss you, too, Joy.

41:16.909 --> 41:20.129
Hey, by the way,
you're killing it in that suit.

41:22.958 --> 41:27.136
Cora, I made
something special for you.

41:37.973 --> 41:39.758
Let's do this.

41:42.891 --> 41:45.807
Thank you for everything,
Ms. Roarke.

41:45.807 --> 41:46.939
Of course.

41:46.939 --> 41:48.244
Yeah, this may come
as a shock,

41:48.244 --> 41:49.550
but now that we know
how our mom's company

41:49.550 --> 41:52.031
came to be
and what makes it what it is,

41:52.031 --> 41:54.120
Bridge and Ross are dead set
on holding onto it.

41:54.120 --> 41:55.643
But we can't risk
losing access

41:55.643 --> 41:57.863
to our product's
cornerstone ingredient.

41:57.863 --> 42:00.953
And I would never jeopardize
my own truffle supply.

42:00.953 --> 42:03.346
The arrangement I made with
your mother must stay as is.

42:03.346 --> 42:05.218
Agreed?
- Agreed.

42:08.047 --> 42:09.439
Safe travels, guys.

42:09.439 --> 42:12.573
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

42:12.573 --> 42:15.358
You three, stay out
of the cockpit.

42:15.358 --> 42:18.361
I'm serious.
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.

42:18.361 --> 42:21.190
Go, go, go, go.

42:21.190 --> 42:24.933
- Come here.
- Ooh.

42:24.933 --> 42:27.980
Not that I'm complaining,
but our previous pilot, Cora,

42:27.980 --> 42:31.287
would have never given me
a kiss like that.

42:31.287 --> 42:34.464
Cora didn't know what
she was missing, did she?

42:34.464 --> 42:35.857
You're used to this kinda
of lifestyle, right?

42:35.857 --> 42:38.381
- Yeah, thank you.
- Ah, nice one.

42:43.082 --> 42:45.650
You have to share.
Oh, my God. Jesus.

42:45.650 --> 42:49.131
Sorry. Sorry.
Last time. Promise.

42:52.134 --> 42:57.444
Oh, my. I'm exhausted. Satisfied.

42:57.444 --> 42:59.794
Hmm. Same.
