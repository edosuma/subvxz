00:08.967 --> 00:10.300
Harper!
I see you dressed

00:10.300 --> 00:12.934
for your history test on
the women's suffrage movement.

00:12.934 --> 00:14.467
- How'd it go?
- Great.

00:14.467 --> 00:16.867
Except I fell off my bustle
during the essay part.

00:16.867 --> 00:19.300
Everybody saw
my pantaloons.

00:21.467 --> 00:22.800
Oh, they're looking again.

00:25.300 --> 00:28.000
Wait a minute.
There's an essay?

00:28.000 --> 00:30.200
I thought there was
just multiple choice.

00:30.200 --> 00:32.800
That's why I wrote down
all my guesses on my arm.

00:32.800 --> 00:34.600
I didn't write anything
about an essay.

00:34.600 --> 00:37.900
Yes, you did. It says "essay"
right there by your elbow.

00:38.934 --> 00:41.300
No, that says "easy."

00:41.300 --> 00:43.800
I wrote that down
as a motivator.

00:46.200 --> 00:47.800
I need to switch brains
with you.

00:47.800 --> 00:50.300
Whoa! I don't want
your brain in my body.

00:50.300 --> 00:53.200
Would it sound better if I said
I wanted to switch bodies?

00:54.700 --> 00:57.133
Well, you are wearing
a cute outfit today.

00:58.500 --> 01:00.400
And I get to wear...

01:00.400 --> 01:02.133
..that. Oh, OK.

01:05.967 --> 01:09.233
Alex, Harper.<i>Cambia corporum</i>
<i>meum corpora sua nominavi.</i>

01:12.367 --> 01:14.133
- Oh!
- Harper?

01:14.133 --> 01:15.767
Alex?

01:15.767 --> 01:17.767
Yes!

01:17.767 --> 01:21.934
[sighs] OK, Alex, I guess
I'll take your test for you,

01:21.934 --> 01:24.867
but I'm not walking around
with the answers on my arm.

01:24.867 --> 01:28.100
Oh, fine, but if you run out
of time at the end of the test,

01:28.100 --> 01:29.467
just answer all As.

01:29.467 --> 01:31.667
You'll be right one fourth
of the time which...

01:31.667 --> 01:33.200
I think is passing.

01:45.400 --> 01:49.000
I had fun with you at the art
museum last night, Justin.

01:49.000 --> 01:51.500
That was a great date.

01:51.500 --> 01:54.667
What? A date?

01:54.667 --> 01:55.900
You and me? Like...

01:57.000 --> 02:01.200
What? The only reason
you and I were alone

02:01.200 --> 02:03.734
is because no one else in
the group bothered to show up.

02:03.734 --> 02:07.567
But I saw the way
you were looking at me.

02:07.567 --> 02:09.600
I was looking at you
because you were standing

02:09.600 --> 02:11.700
in front of every painting
I was looking at.

02:11.700 --> 02:15.700
Oh, I was looking at you
looking at the art,

02:15.700 --> 02:17.600
because that was my art.

02:17.600 --> 02:20.233
And now my cell-phone wallpaper.

02:23.967 --> 02:26.934
I've read tons of articles
on dating and relationships,

02:26.934 --> 02:29.200
and last night
was definitely a date.

02:31.934 --> 02:34.867
Staying alone with someone
because you don't wanna be rude

02:34.867 --> 02:37.934
and just bug out of there
is not a date.

02:37.934 --> 02:39.567
I do the all quizzes, too.

02:39.567 --> 02:41.367
They all say
I'd be a great girlfriend.

02:41.367 --> 02:44.367
- Girlfriend?
- Yes! I'll be your girlfriend.

02:44.367 --> 02:49.000
- I'm so glad you asked.
- No! I don't think I did.

02:49.000 --> 02:51.100
And by the way,
I'm talking slowly right now,

02:51.100 --> 02:53.500
which means I don't understand
what's happening.

02:53.500 --> 02:56.467
I'll tell you
what's happening. Love.

02:56.467 --> 02:58.900
And love is
the most important thing.

02:58.900 --> 03:02.500
Because in the future,
when the aliens take over,

03:02.500 --> 03:04.834
it's the only thing
we'll have left.

03:04.834 --> 03:07.400
You know, you really didn't
have to add the alien part

03:07.400 --> 03:09.300
'cause I'm already
really scared.

03:09.300 --> 03:11.467
That's how you know
it's real.

03:11.467 --> 03:13.033
Hey, so what are you
doing tonight?

03:13.033 --> 03:15.100
Because I think
we should go on a second date.

03:15.100 --> 03:18.600
Oh, you do? I can't, because
I'm going to the Mets game.

03:18.600 --> 03:20.400
Great! It's a date.

03:20.400 --> 03:23.767
Our relationship is off
to a great start.

03:23.767 --> 03:27.400
Hey, I know it's taken me
a long time to say this,

03:27.400 --> 03:29.767
- but I love you.
- Uhh!

03:32.600 --> 03:34.200
I'm in love!

03:39.600 --> 03:43.400
Way to go, Justin.
You're in a relationship.

03:43.400 --> 03:46.500
I never thought
it would happen.

03:46.500 --> 03:48.967
What are you talking about?
It happens all the time.

03:48.967 --> 03:51.200
The werewolf, the centaur girl,
the goth chick.

03:51.200 --> 03:53.300
Why do people think
I don't date?

03:53.300 --> 03:54.900
I don't remember 'em.

03:56.834 --> 03:59.500
Anyway, it's awesome that you
came to me with this problem.

03:59.500 --> 04:01.934
I didn't come to you.
You came over here to me.

04:01.934 --> 04:05.800
True, but you usually go
to Alex with this type of stuff.

04:05.800 --> 04:08.200
You're talking to me.
I'm taking it as a victory.

04:09.500 --> 04:12.000
I am here for you, bro.

04:13.200 --> 04:16.867
OK. [sighs] So what
should I do about Daphne

04:16.867 --> 04:19.800
thinking that we're dating
when we're actually not dating?

04:19.800 --> 04:23.100
Hmm. That is a tough one.

04:25.367 --> 04:27.233
I am stumped.

05:24.934 --> 05:27.200
OK, Alex, I really aced
your history test for you.

05:27.200 --> 05:29.467
I hope you made it believable
that I took the test.

05:29.467 --> 05:31.000
For the things
you didn't know,

05:31.000 --> 05:33.600
did you draw a picture
to distract them?

05:33.600 --> 05:36.300
I just don't feel right
about cheating like this.

05:36.300 --> 05:39.133
Cheaters never prosper.
Switch me back. Switch me back!

05:39.133 --> 05:41.233
OK. Alex, Harper.

05:41.233 --> 05:44.000
<i>Cambia corporum</i>
<i>meum corpora sua nominavi.</i>

05:48.300 --> 05:51.567
What happened?
Why am I still looking at me?

05:51.567 --> 05:53.300
And you spilled
iced mocha on my dress.

05:53.300 --> 05:55.667
Suffragettes did not drink
iced mochas.

05:55.667 --> 05:57.567
Cool it, weirdo.
It didn't work.

05:57.567 --> 05:59.300
Let me try it again.

05:59.300 --> 06:03.300
Alex, Harper.<i>Cambia corporum</i>
<i>meum corpora sua nominavi.</i>

06:05.233 --> 06:07.400
I don't know what happened,
but don't worry.

06:07.400 --> 06:09.834
I'll just go into the lair
and figure it out.

06:13.400 --> 06:14.400
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

06:14.400 --> 06:16.767
Hi, Justin. Cute shirt.

06:16.767 --> 06:19.900
Thank you. I actually...
What did you do to it?

06:19.900 --> 06:22.000
- Where?
- Stop it, Alex.

06:22.000 --> 06:24.100
- We're on a mission.
- Oh, Alex.

06:24.100 --> 06:26.734
I need to ask you
something.

06:26.734 --> 06:28.667
I'm taking a girl
to the baseball game.

06:28.667 --> 06:30.300
What girl?
Who are you taking?

06:30.300 --> 06:32.000
Daphne.
She thinks we're dating.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.300
I need your sneaky advice
of how to get out of it.

06:34.300 --> 06:36.867
Dump her. Just dump her.
Dump her hard.

06:39.000 --> 06:41.934
Oh! You wanna get rid of her,
you're gonna need a road flare,

06:41.934 --> 06:44.033
a barrel of maple syrup,
and a mini trampoline.

06:44.033 --> 06:47.100
We're not using the maple syrup
for what you think. We gotta go.

06:49.200 --> 06:51.967
And what did I think we were
using the maple syrup for?

06:51.967 --> 06:53.734
Like who...

06:55.200 --> 06:57.800
Oh!

06:59.100 --> 07:01.133
I get it.

07:07.133 --> 07:08.667
Hey. Huh? Ooh!

07:08.667 --> 07:10.600
[chuckles] Look what I found

07:10.600 --> 07:13.400
when I was dropping some stuff
off at the resale shop.

07:13.400 --> 07:15.700
It's the Almost Charades
board game.

07:15.700 --> 07:19.233
Like we used to play
on family game night. Ooh!

07:21.400 --> 07:24.600
Honey, I got rid of that thing
for a reason.

07:24.600 --> 07:28.100
Family game night
nearly destroyed this family.

07:28.100 --> 07:31.200
Don't you remember?
The fighting, the cheating,

07:31.200 --> 07:33.133
the crying
when someone lost?

07:33.133 --> 07:34.467
[scoffs]

07:34.467 --> 07:36.734
But that's because
the kids were young.

07:36.734 --> 07:38.800
I think they're old enough
to handle it now.

07:38.800 --> 07:40.834
They weren't the ones
who were crying.

07:40.834 --> 07:44.200
Come on.
Let's play tonight. Please.

07:44.200 --> 07:46.100
Please.
Please, please, please.

07:46.100 --> 07:48.500
All right, fine,
we'll play.

07:48.500 --> 07:51.033
But you know what?
We're gonna play on the terrace.

07:51.033 --> 07:53.767
- Fine.
- Why do we have to play there?

07:53.767 --> 07:56.200
Because that way
we'll be out in front

07:56.200 --> 07:58.600
where all the neighbors
can see.

07:58.600 --> 08:00.367
We'll be shamed
into behaving well.

08:02.400 --> 08:04.033
And also,
when stuff starts to fly,

08:04.033 --> 08:06.367
my ceiling won't get stained
with guacamole.

08:06.367 --> 08:08.033
Oh, good.

08:08.033 --> 08:11.100
I thought that was something
seeping down from Max's room.

08:15.500 --> 08:18.000
That is totally
coming from my room.

08:33.100 --> 08:36.567
So, how was the date?

08:37.500 --> 08:39.200
What do you think?

08:39.200 --> 08:41.100
I think I thought of a way

08:41.100 --> 08:44.033
for you to break with her
at the ball game. Check it out.

08:44.033 --> 08:47.400
After a batter strikes out,
you look at her and you say,

08:47.400 --> 08:50.500
"Strike three!
You're out!"

08:50.500 --> 08:52.767
"No, seriously,
get outta here."

08:56.100 --> 08:57.500
I kissed her.

08:57.500 --> 09:01.000
Oh. You wanted her
to break up with you.

09:03.400 --> 09:06.100
No, I was leaning in to tell her
we weren't in a relationship.

09:06.100 --> 09:08.300
Then, of course, they put us
up on the big screen.

09:08.300 --> 09:11.400
The whole crowd kept chanting,
"Kiss, kiss, kiss, you guys!"

09:11.400 --> 09:14.300
"Kiss, kiss!"
And I choked under the pressure.

09:15.400 --> 09:16.967
Well, lucky for you,

09:16.967 --> 09:19.867
I still know a way
for you to get rid of her.

09:19.867 --> 09:22.500
Look, Dad's forcing us to have
family game night tonight.

09:22.500 --> 09:25.734
You know us. The cops'll be
there an hour after we start.

09:25.734 --> 09:28.300
And I'll invite Daphne
to come.

09:28.300 --> 09:31.100
She'll see how mean and hurtful
and cheating us Russos can be,

09:31.100 --> 09:33.000
she'll bail
and never wanna see me again.

09:33.000 --> 09:35.400
That's a great idea.

09:35.400 --> 09:38.033
I was thinking we could plant
some of Mom's jewelry on her

09:38.033 --> 09:39.700
and get her arrested.

09:39.700 --> 09:42.934
I gotta call Daphne right now.
This is a great idea.

09:42.934 --> 09:44.667
I know.
Hey, You should've started

09:44.667 --> 09:47.100
coming to me for advice
years ago, huh?

09:47.100 --> 09:49.700
I didn't come. You were
standing there when I walked in.

09:49.700 --> 09:51.667
And you talked.
That's good enough for me.

09:54.367 --> 09:57.467
So Justin told me
all about his new girlfriend.

09:57.467 --> 10:01.800
Yeah, he and I are tight now.
Close buds. Tells me everything.

10:02.734 --> 10:05.000
Really?
Justin has a girlfriend?

10:05.000 --> 10:06.500
Mm-hm, yeah.
Her name's Daphne.

10:06.500 --> 10:08.900
He also told me that
he's bringing her home tonight.

10:08.900 --> 10:12.867
Wow. He must really like her
if he's bringing her to meet us.

10:12.867 --> 10:15.900
Does he know
it's family game night?

10:15.900 --> 10:17.700
He knows.

10:17.700 --> 10:20.567
Well, we'll just have to be
on our best behavior, then.

10:20.567 --> 10:24.567
Theresa, we will be friendly
and cordial and polite.

10:24.567 --> 10:27.233
Good sportsmanship
is the order of the day.

10:27.233 --> 10:30.100
Mm. That is a great idea, too.

10:30.100 --> 10:32.800
- There was another idea?
- Justin had a great idea.

10:32.800 --> 10:36.200
But this one's great too.
I say go with it.

10:39.133 --> 10:41.133
Here's one that might work.

10:44.133 --> 10:46.133
Hair brainium scheme changium.

10:52.700 --> 10:54.967
That's not it.

10:54.967 --> 10:58.600
Alex, why do I still have
your body, except with my hair?

10:58.600 --> 11:00.567
Oh, it smells like a waterfall.

11:02.700 --> 11:04.200
OK, what about this one?

11:04.200 --> 11:07.767
After all that's been said,
we wanna switch back our heads.

11:11.400 --> 11:14.600
- [Alex's voice] Oh, I did it.
- [Harper's voice]
Not exactly, Alex.

11:14.600 --> 11:16.467
I'd still like
my body back.

11:16.467 --> 11:18.600
You don't sound
like yourself.

11:18.600 --> 11:20.100
You sound like me.

11:20.100 --> 11:22.100
OK. Stop yelling.

11:22.100 --> 11:24.500
Voices right noises.

11:26.867 --> 11:29.700
[with Alex's voice]
Testing, one, two, three.

11:29.700 --> 11:31.767
Again, I'd like
my body back, Alex.

11:31.767 --> 11:35.100
I'm on it. I'm on it.
We can do this, Harper.

11:35.100 --> 11:37.967
This has all been a pain.
We wanna switch back our brains.

11:42.000 --> 11:44.600
[as Alex] Wow! There's
a lot of pressure in here.

11:48.900 --> 11:50.300
Waterfall.

11:53.100 --> 11:55.600
[hollow sound]

11:55.600 --> 11:58.233
Oh, my goodness.
Now you have no brain.

11:58.233 --> 12:01.033
[as Harper] Actually, my brain's
inside your head, Alex.

12:01.033 --> 12:05.000
[as Alex] Ow! All these brains
are pounding against my skull.

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
Oh, no wonder smart people
are no fun.

12:07.000 --> 12:08.500
- Pretty...
- No!

12:15.300 --> 12:18.100
OK, Harper. Maybe I should
just try another spell.

12:18.100 --> 12:20.934
[as Harper] Let's see. My brain
is crammed inside your head,

12:20.934 --> 12:22.867
and I'm standing over there
looking lost,

12:22.867 --> 12:24.800
like my dad
when I talk about the Internet.

12:24.800 --> 12:27.300
Sure, try another spell.
How could it get any worse?

12:27.300 --> 12:29.767
[as Alex] OK, Harper,
I know we can do this

12:29.767 --> 12:31.367
if we just
put our heads together.

12:31.367 --> 12:33.400
Well, our heads
can't get much more together

12:33.400 --> 12:35.100
and that doesn't seem
to be helping.

12:35.100 --> 12:38.500
OK, um... Maybe we should
just go to Justin.

12:38.500 --> 12:41.200
Really? Because I suggested
that five minutes ago

12:41.200 --> 12:42.367
before you did all this.

12:42.367 --> 12:44.367
OK, OK.

12:44.367 --> 12:47.600
But what do we do with
that thing while we're gone?

12:48.834 --> 12:50.133
[clears throat] Um...

12:50.133 --> 12:52.700
"That thing" is me.

12:52.700 --> 12:54.967
How about we tuck me into bed
so I'll go to sleep?

12:54.967 --> 12:57.000
Looks like someone's
using their noggin.

12:57.000 --> 12:59.600
- Nap time!
- See?

13:02.867 --> 13:04.233
Lawn mower.

13:04.233 --> 13:06.300
Oh, you don't know
what this thing wants. No!

13:17.967 --> 13:19.934
Aren't you getting dressed
for your date?

13:19.934 --> 13:22.467
These are
my good flip-flops.

13:22.467 --> 13:24.734
They match the sweater.

13:25.834 --> 13:27.500
OK. Well, we're all
very excited

13:27.500 --> 13:30.000
that Daphne's coming over
for family game night.

13:30.000 --> 13:32.367
We'll do anything to help
this romance flourish.

13:32.367 --> 13:34.767
Ooh, Theresa, why don't you
make your deviled eggs?

13:34.767 --> 13:36.233
And put a dozen aside
for me.

13:36.233 --> 13:39.367
No, no. You guys
just be yourselves, OK?

13:39.367 --> 13:41.767
I want Daphne to get to know
you guys for who you are.

13:41.767 --> 13:45.500
This night should be like
any other family game night.

13:47.700 --> 13:50.934
Alex, you're just in time
for family game night.

13:50.934 --> 13:52.600
Sorry.
I don't play games.

13:52.600 --> 13:55.467
Especially ones that end
like crime-scene tape.

13:55.467 --> 13:58.567
[as Harper] Oh, let's play,
Alex. I love games.

13:58.567 --> 14:01.734
Harper, stop talking. We gotta
get Justin and get out of here.

14:01.734 --> 14:03.200
I'm sorry.
I can't help it.

14:03.200 --> 14:05.667
Every time you have a thought,
it comes out your mouth.

14:05.667 --> 14:07.967
You can be so bossy.
Oh, I didn't mean to say that.

14:07.967 --> 14:09.467
Harper! Justin.

14:11.400 --> 14:12.834
What are you doing?

14:12.834 --> 14:16.000
[whispers] I have two brains
inside my head.

14:19.000 --> 14:20.767
If you're trying
to psyche me out,

14:20.767 --> 14:22.300
you have to do
better than that.

14:22.300 --> 14:24.767
No, no, no.
I'm serious.

14:24.767 --> 14:26.367
I mixed up a bunch of spells

14:26.367 --> 14:29.467
and now I got Harper's brain
inside my head.

14:29.467 --> 14:31.734
I can prove it.
Just talk to Harper's brain.

14:33.200 --> 14:34.867
OK, let me...

14:36.767 --> 14:38.600
Let me see.

14:40.500 --> 14:43.367
Hello, Harper's brain.

14:44.767 --> 14:48.400
You're staring at me with those
eyes. I think I might faint.

14:50.467 --> 14:52.467
Definitely Harper's brain
all right.

14:52.467 --> 14:54.300
How'd this happen?

14:54.300 --> 14:56.600
I did the body switching spell
and I can't undo it.

14:56.600 --> 14:58.900
Body switching?
Don't you read the wizard memos?

14:58.900 --> 15:00.900
That spell's full
of glitches.

15:00.900 --> 15:04.500
- What's wrong with it?
- I think you just found out.

15:04.500 --> 15:05.934
[doorbell rings]

15:05.934 --> 15:07.767
Daphne's here.

15:07.767 --> 15:11.500
You three should really get
to know each other. Stay put.

15:11.500 --> 15:14.133
Fine. If you're not gonna help
me, I'm getting out of here.

15:14.133 --> 15:16.900
I'm going downstairs
to get cold cuts.

15:19.133 --> 15:20.667
Come on in,
Daphne.

15:33.100 --> 15:36.233
<i>Teen Girl</i>magazine says, "Never
meet the family empty-handed,"

15:36.233 --> 15:38.867
so I brought cold cuts.

15:38.867 --> 15:41.500
Terrific. Now Alex doesn't have
to go downstairs.

15:41.500 --> 15:44.233
She can stay up here
and mingle.

15:44.233 --> 15:47.400
Really?
My family owns a deli shop.

15:47.400 --> 15:50.233
[as Harper] Alex,
we have guests. Be polite.

15:50.233 --> 15:51.667
[grunts]

15:51.667 --> 15:53.667
Um, hi.

15:53.667 --> 15:56.500
Welcome, Daphne.
So nice to meet you.

15:56.500 --> 15:58.133
Welcome to our
normal home.

15:58.133 --> 16:02.400
I'm Justin's calm,
level-headed dad.

16:02.400 --> 16:05.033
Yeah, until the game starts.

16:05.033 --> 16:07.233
Let's all go out
onto the terrace

16:07.233 --> 16:09.800
in full view of the neighbors
where everyone can see us.

16:13.400 --> 16:16.367
Let's do it. I love charades.
But my parents won't play.

16:16.367 --> 16:18.100
They say their whole life
is a charade.

16:18.100 --> 16:20.500
Harper, we can't play charades
with two brains.

16:20.500 --> 16:22.367
My parents will know
something's up.

16:23.700 --> 16:27.767
Oh! You figured out
how to move my feet.

16:27.767 --> 16:30.834
Your brain has a short attention
span. It's easy to overpower.

16:30.834 --> 16:33.967
No! I am not playing...

16:33.967 --> 16:34.967
No!

16:38.400 --> 16:40.300
Now, remember,
this is Almost Charades.

16:40.300 --> 16:43.467
You can only write down books,
movies or television shows.

16:45.100 --> 16:47.734
Oh, it's so great

16:47.734 --> 16:51.500
to play a civilized game
of charades with the family.

16:51.500 --> 16:53.934
That's right.
We're out here playing charades.

16:53.934 --> 16:55.900
In a friendly, family way.

16:55.900 --> 16:58.567
[woman] Quiet down there,
ya nut!

16:59.800 --> 17:01.800
All right,
let's divide into teams.

17:01.800 --> 17:04.667
Team one: Justin, me,
and the lovely Daphne.

17:04.667 --> 17:06.200
Team two: Jerry, Max, and Alex.

17:06.200 --> 17:07.200
Yeah!

17:09.567 --> 17:11.900
Whatever you say, honey.

17:11.900 --> 17:14.200
Dad, those teams aren't fair.

17:14.200 --> 17:16.934
Aren't you gonna accuse Mom
of stacking things in her favor

17:16.934 --> 17:18.767
then go off and pout
like you usually do?

17:18.767 --> 17:21.567
Whatever your mom wants,
I'm happy to comply.

17:21.567 --> 17:24.300
I just want our guest, Daphne,
to have a good time.

17:24.300 --> 17:27.367
Oh! Justin, your parents
make me feel like

17:27.367 --> 17:29.500
I'm already part
of the family.

17:29.500 --> 17:31.967
We're so compatible.

17:31.967 --> 17:34.000
Alex, get out here!

17:35.467 --> 17:38.100
Wow, Harper,
you're strong.

17:38.100 --> 17:41.000
Daphne, you should really
get to know Alex.

17:41.000 --> 17:43.934
She's got a lot going on
up here.

17:45.200 --> 17:48.100
Hey, Harper.
Come on out.

17:50.767 --> 17:52.000
Hello, Daphne.

17:52.000 --> 17:54.400
If you don't stay away
from Justin, I'm going to...

17:54.400 --> 17:57.900
Eat more of this. Mmmm.

17:59.400 --> 18:03.734
Why, thank you. Justin, your
sister's so sweet and hungry.

18:04.967 --> 18:08.100
You haven't really seen
the real her.

18:08.100 --> 18:10.800
OK, let the games begin.

18:13.100 --> 18:17.100
Oh, this is a good one.
I'm ready.

18:19.467 --> 18:21.667
Two words. First word.

18:21.667 --> 18:24.200
- One syllable.
- You got it!

18:27.967 --> 18:30.967
- Who wrote down "One syllable"?
- I did.

18:34.467 --> 18:36.300
You're supposed
to write titles.

18:36.300 --> 18:39.100
That is infuriating,
isn't it, Dad?

18:39.100 --> 18:43.000
Doesn't it make you
just wanna throw a table?

18:43.000 --> 18:46.834
I'm sure there's a book
titled<i>One Syllable</i>

18:46.834 --> 18:48.300
out there somewhere.

18:48.300 --> 18:50.467
Excellent guess, Daphne.

18:50.467 --> 18:53.200
She's smart and beautiful,
just like your mother.

18:53.200 --> 18:56.600
Aw! This is the best
family game night ever.

18:56.600 --> 18:59.133
What a loving family.

18:59.133 --> 19:01.800
I guess it's true, "The family
that plays together..."

19:01.800 --> 19:04.667
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
"Stays together." Alex's turn!

19:04.667 --> 19:08.500
Oh, yay! Me, first. Me, first.
Can I go first, pretty please?

19:08.500 --> 19:10.200
- Uh, OK.
- Uh, really?

19:12.700 --> 19:14.367
Harper, I hate charades.

19:14.367 --> 19:17.300
Hate charades?
That's like hating sunshine.

19:17.300 --> 19:18.600
OK!

19:20.100 --> 19:21.400
Movie!

19:21.400 --> 19:23.000
[Max] Three words.

19:23.000 --> 19:24.500
[Jerry] Foot.

19:24.500 --> 19:26.834
- Sock.
- Foot. Bunion foot!

19:26.834 --> 19:28.400
- Foot!
- Foot! Foot!

19:28.400 --> 19:32.200
- I... Ball of your foot.
- Ball of your foot.

19:32.200 --> 19:34.900
[Max] Oh, um...

19:34.900 --> 19:37.100
Foot. Calluses.
Callus, ball, foot.

19:37.100 --> 19:40.400
- That's three words.
- For the love! It's "football."

19:40.400 --> 19:43.033
A movie. Football.
<i>Friday Night Lights.</i>

19:43.033 --> 19:45.367
Yes! You got it.

19:45.367 --> 19:47.400
Wait a minute.
You said, "Football."

19:47.400 --> 19:50.000
You talked. You're disqualified.
She's disqualified.

19:50.000 --> 19:52.867
- Good. I'm out of here.
- Alex, you're not disqualified.

19:52.867 --> 19:54.734
I got that fair and square.

19:54.734 --> 19:58.000
Your mother is stacking
the teams against us!

19:58.000 --> 20:00.300
That's what
I'm talking about.

20:00.300 --> 20:03.934
What?! What?
You heard her. She cheated.

20:03.934 --> 20:07.400
And I'm livid! They should both
be disqualified. Out of here!

20:07.400 --> 20:09.967
Ho! This if totally bogus.

20:09.967 --> 20:12.000
Dad's pouting
'cause he lost a fight again.

20:12.000 --> 20:14.667
No! We are not fighting. That's
one thing we're not doing.

20:14.667 --> 20:17.200
We're not fighting,
so stop fighting!

20:17.200 --> 20:20.200
The neighbors can hear us!

20:21.400 --> 20:24.000
[woman] That's it!
I'm calling the cops!

20:26.200 --> 20:28.600
<i>- Karate Kid!</i>
- We are not fighting!

20:28.600 --> 20:31.100
We are trying
to make a good impression!

20:31.100 --> 20:33.467
I think your family
should keep it down.

20:33.467 --> 20:35.300
Nah, they're good.

20:35.300 --> 20:37.600
Da-ta!

20:37.600 --> 20:39.300
Oh, no!

20:40.000 --> 20:41.133
Lollipop.

20:43.000 --> 20:45.200
Alex, what did you do
to Harper?

20:45.200 --> 20:48.500
Uh, nothing. See, this is why
I should have tied you up.

20:48.500 --> 20:51.300
That's a great idea. Someone
should have tied you up.

20:51.300 --> 20:53.200
What's wrong
with these people?

20:53.200 --> 20:56.400
Nothing. This is just
a typical family game night.

21:00.233 --> 21:02.600
You call this normal?

21:02.600 --> 21:04.367
Yes. You should get
used to it,

21:04.367 --> 21:06.100
now that we're
in this relationship.

21:06.100 --> 21:08.700
Oh, no, no, no.
I am way over my head

21:08.700 --> 21:10.500
with this toxic family dynamic.

21:10.500 --> 21:14.700
And next time you meet a girl,
Justin, do not bring her home!

21:29.667 --> 21:32.367
Please, brain, leave, brain.

21:32.367 --> 21:35.367
Oh, really? It's just that easy?

21:35.367 --> 21:39.000
And polite. No wonder you
couldn't figure out the spell.

21:40.834 --> 21:43.300
Please, brain,
leave, brain.

21:45.367 --> 21:47.300
Oh, I'm back.

21:48.767 --> 21:49.834
It feels good.

21:49.834 --> 21:51.367
Yes.

21:51.367 --> 21:53.600
Feels awesome
having my skull back.

21:53.600 --> 21:55.600
Every time I kept looking
out my eyes,

21:55.600 --> 21:57.300
your brain
kept leaning in going,

21:57.300 --> 21:59.200
"Let me see! Let me see!"

22:00.567 --> 22:02.500
Well, I didn't wanna
look in your brain.

22:02.500 --> 22:04.467
There's a lot of scary stuff
in there.

22:07.467 --> 22:08.600
Thank you.
