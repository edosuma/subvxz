WEBVTT

00:04.163 --> 00:05.533
Hey Josh.

00:05.688 --> 00:07.495
We each got you something

00:07.496 --> 00:09.607
to kick off the launch of your new app.

00:09.768 --> 00:11.590
Appy-birthday!

00:13.319 --> 00:16.321
Get it? App-y instead of happy?

00:16.475 --> 00:17.735
I thought of it.

00:18.444 --> 00:20.404
Do any of them happen to be a Xanax?

00:21.629 --> 00:23.430
I'm just kidding. No, I'm not.

00:26.018 --> 00:28.068
Good morning!

00:29.369 --> 00:30.970
What's... what's going on?

00:30.971 --> 00:33.272
What's happening?

00:34.550 --> 00:35.975
"What's happening?"

00:35.976 --> 00:37.656
The first new app Josh has released

00:37.657 --> 00:39.584
in a year is going live in 30 minutes.

00:39.591 --> 00:42.782
And to distract him
from this crucial moment

00:42.783 --> 00:45.652
that could make or break his career,

00:46.586 --> 00:48.418
the people that love him

00:48.488 --> 00:51.290
are giving him presents.

00:52.392 --> 00:54.713
Oh, yeah. I mean I know that's happening.

00:54.714 --> 00:57.407
I meant... you know, what's happening else?

00:59.143 --> 01:01.137
Nothing. What did you get him?

01:01.138 --> 01:03.035
I... I, um...

01:03.269 --> 01:05.738
I got him a... oh no, no... oh no...

01:05.739 --> 01:07.440
Ha ha, almost got me.

01:07.441 --> 01:08.795
It's a surprise.

01:10.144 --> 01:12.154
Guys, you didn't have to get me anything.

01:12.245 --> 01:14.685
Good, because she obviously didn't.

01:15.515 --> 01:19.051
Yes I did. In fact, my gift is so amazing,

01:19.085 --> 01:21.821
and personal, and indescribable,

01:21.855 --> 01:24.096
I'm going to stop describing it.

01:26.026 --> 01:28.627
Open mine! Open mine!

01:32.477 --> 01:34.167
It's a top of the line bike rack!

01:36.112 --> 01:39.048
Elliot, you combined
my two favorite things.

01:39.137 --> 01:40.599
Bikes and racks. Up top!

01:43.630 --> 01:46.254
Well, I have to admit, Elliot, I was afraid

01:46.255 --> 01:47.931
that your gift would be better.

01:47.980 --> 01:49.314
But it's not!

01:50.317 --> 01:51.517
Boom.

01:53.000 --> 01:59.074
Advertise your product or brand here

02:03.333 --> 02:04.934
What is... what is this?

02:05.532 --> 02:07.299
It's a bobblehead.

02:08.501 --> 02:10.336
Of you! I had it made.

02:10.371 --> 02:11.337
Where...

02:11.338 --> 02:13.105
Am I gonna put this bobblehead?

02:13.106 --> 02:14.339
I love it.

02:15.471 --> 02:17.009
Oh...

02:18.278 --> 02:21.146
I'm so mad that my gift isn't here yet.

02:21.181 --> 02:23.082
So you can open it... ah, oh!

02:23.116 --> 02:24.917
Let me check on the tracking.

02:24.951 --> 02:28.153
Yeah... oh no.

02:28.188 --> 02:32.730
There's a stupid snowstorm
in the... snowstormy areas.

02:33.851 --> 02:36.095
Oh! Oh look.

02:36.129 --> 02:39.840
It says it's going to be
here by late afternoon-ish.

02:41.234 --> 02:44.273
Um... unrelated, can I take an early lunch?

02:51.211 --> 02:53.312
♪ She in the spotlight ♪

02:53.346 --> 02:55.114
♪ And she turned my head ♪

03:07.093 --> 03:09.094
Okay. This gift has to be unique,

03:09.129 --> 03:10.498
and personal, and less than

03:10.499 --> 03:12.069
the $12 we found in the couch.

03:12.999 --> 03:14.199
Ooh!

03:14.200 --> 03:15.968
How about a fedora?

03:17.304 --> 03:18.531
Nah, too Pharrell-y.

03:19.339 --> 03:20.940
All right, so...

03:20.974 --> 03:22.226
Ooh! How about a vest?

03:23.109 --> 03:24.309
Too Elliot-y.

03:26.212 --> 03:28.586
Okie-dokie... ooh!

03:28.587 --> 03:30.158
A turtleneck.

03:30.350 --> 03:31.581
Too mime-y.

03:32.352 --> 03:34.615
Really? Was Steve Jobs a mime?

03:35.179 --> 03:36.379
Maybe.

03:36.508 --> 03:38.520
But wasn't he like a big huge computer guy?

03:40.427 --> 03:43.079
Yes, and this was his signature shirt.

03:43.096 --> 03:44.405
A black mock turtleneck.

03:44.751 --> 03:46.325
You really think Josh is that much of a

03:46.326 --> 03:48.108
nerd that he's gonna like
a black mock turtleneck

03:48.109 --> 03:49.935
just because Steve Jobs wore one?

03:49.970 --> 03:52.249
- Eh, probably not...
- No no no! It's perfect!

03:52.673 --> 03:53.873
How much is it?

03:53.874 --> 03:55.074
Ah, Fifteen dollars.

03:55.075 --> 03:56.282
Dammit. We don't have enough.

03:56.283 --> 03:57.943
Well, you don't need enough when you

03:57.944 --> 03:59.224
got Li'l So So.

04:01.114 --> 04:03.916
Ahem, eight bucks. Take it or leave it.

04:04.035 --> 04:05.235
Leave it.

04:05.426 --> 04:06.626
Come on, chica.

04:06.627 --> 04:08.511
This crappy old shirt isn't worth $15.

04:08.512 --> 04:10.693
There's gotta be something we can do.

04:11.958 --> 04:14.048
Add $7.

04:14.981 --> 04:16.366
That's this many.

04:17.673 --> 04:18.873
Please, Lilly!

04:18.874 --> 04:20.173
Frugal Lilly.

04:20.175 --> 04:22.137
Miss Frugal Lilly.

04:22.400 --> 04:25.824
Um. this is for my boss, and if I don't
get him something, I could lose my job.

04:25.825 --> 04:27.529
Okay? And my best friend
isn't working right now,

04:27.530 --> 04:29.908
so I'm the only one working in the family.

04:30.937 --> 04:33.086
Tell you what sweetheart, three dollars off

04:33.179 --> 04:34.791
if you join the mailing list.

04:34.792 --> 04:36.106
Okay.

04:37.516 --> 04:39.026
You're welcome.

04:45.790 --> 04:49.410
Okay, the app's been live for an hour now.

04:49.486 --> 04:50.688
How are the numbers?

04:50.698 --> 04:52.466
I believe the way my
chief financial officer

04:52.467 --> 04:55.236
put it was, "Oh God! Oh God! Why?"

04:56.575 --> 04:58.207
It's over, Elliot. It failed.

04:59.005 --> 05:01.331
I can see you're upset.

05:01.489 --> 05:02.908
Would you like me to...

05:05.779 --> 05:07.379
Come on!

05:09.682 --> 05:11.117
Oh, shut up.

05:11.418 --> 05:12.719
<i>You shut up.</i>

05:14.439 --> 05:15.639
(Scoffs)

05:15.803 --> 05:17.020
(Laughs in disbelief)

05:17.357 --> 05:18.680
I'm losing it.

05:18.915 --> 05:20.459
<i>Yeah. You are.</i>

05:20.516 --> 05:23.095
<i>Losing your edge. Losing you talent.</i>

05:23.129 --> 05:25.034
<i>You're not relevant anymore.</i>

05:26.866 --> 05:28.066
Enough.

05:32.828 --> 05:34.525
- (Josh exhales)
- (Bobblehead Josh) <i>Loser!</i>

05:34.526 --> 05:35.726
Nope.

05:36.165 --> 05:37.881
(Cackling)

05:40.647 --> 05:42.512
Not easy fitting something so big

05:42.513 --> 05:44.062
through such a small hole.

05:44.719 --> 05:46.129
That's what he said.

05:48.158 --> 05:49.541
I come up with a zinger like that

05:49.542 --> 05:51.141
and no one's around to hear it.

05:51.142 --> 05:52.342
Huh?!

05:59.113 --> 06:00.562
Huh, phew!

06:00.607 --> 06:03.066
You would think rich people's
trash would smell better.

06:03.837 --> 06:06.317
I guess that's why they
call 'em stinkin' rich.

06:07.097 --> 06:09.177
Damn, I got to start
writing this stuff down.

06:12.545 --> 06:13.777
What the hell?

06:13.778 --> 06:15.942
That's the bobblehead I got for Josh.

06:16.508 --> 06:18.542
That ungrateful son of a...

06:18.877 --> 06:20.797
Hm, good thing I didn't go with the puppy.

06:22.856 --> 06:24.056
(Door opens)

06:25.925 --> 06:28.167
Guess what you got?

06:28.695 --> 06:30.399
An app that's going nowhere?

06:30.630 --> 06:32.541
Guess what else?

06:33.994 --> 06:37.475
The gift arrived that no
one believed I got you!

06:37.840 --> 06:39.835
It's here! Open it, open
it, open it, open it...

06:48.615 --> 06:49.815
Black turtleneck.

06:49.816 --> 06:51.515
It's the same kind that Steve Jobs wore.

06:51.516 --> 06:53.701
I got it because you remind me of him.

06:54.404 --> 06:56.271
How am I like Steve Jobs?

06:56.272 --> 06:58.273
Steve Jobs was successful.

06:58.755 --> 06:59.955
Uh...

06:59.956 --> 07:01.686
Well you know, he wasn't always.

07:01.687 --> 07:03.792
He had... he had ups and downs, right?

07:05.936 --> 07:07.136
Of course he did.

07:07.137 --> 07:10.279
Yeah. You know, he had
success and he had failure.

07:11.679 --> 07:13.103
I mean that's the same thing you just said,

07:13.104 --> 07:14.392
but I see where you're going.

07:15.495 --> 07:16.695
Wait a minute.

07:17.154 --> 07:20.741
You got me this turtleneck
to remind me that even though

07:20.742 --> 07:23.167
Steve Jobs had some
occasional disappointments,

07:23.168 --> 07:25.336
he went on to take over the
entire world of technology.

07:25.729 --> 07:27.073
And maybe I will too.

07:27.166 --> 07:29.689
Yeah. It's like you read my card.

07:37.178 --> 07:39.779
So was I right about the gift?

07:39.780 --> 07:42.302
Yes! And I gave it to
him at the perfect time.

07:42.371 --> 07:44.586
Right when his app was failing.

07:45.821 --> 07:47.216
Oh no. His app is fail...

07:47.217 --> 07:48.832
So you want to know the best part?

07:49.682 --> 07:52.835
He loved it. It gave him hope. And
isn't that what gift giving is all about?

07:52.836 --> 07:54.036
(Knocking)

07:58.104 --> 08:00.822
Lilly! From Frugal Lilly's!

08:01.329 --> 08:03.809
Great memory, you met me two hours ago.

08:04.557 --> 08:06.091
I need the turtleneck back.

08:06.092 --> 08:07.941
I'm sorry, Lilly, the shirt's not for sale.

08:07.942 --> 08:09.242
Well, make it for sale.

08:09.243 --> 08:12.126
Turns out it belonged
to the actual Steve Jobs.

08:12.127 --> 08:13.337
What? Seriously?

08:13.338 --> 08:16.138
Yeah, the maid brought it in
accidentally and the family wants it back.

08:16.579 --> 08:18.745
Oh, really?

08:19.800 --> 08:22.434
Well, then Li'l So So
better get her galoshes

08:22.435 --> 08:24.379
'cause that family's about to make it rain!

08:26.990 --> 08:29.759
Lilly, listen, my boss is in love with it

08:29.760 --> 08:31.627
and he's... he was in a really bad place.

08:31.628 --> 08:33.337
So I'm sorry, but no amount of money

08:33.339 --> 08:34.780
could make me take it away from him.

08:35.115 --> 08:38.240
- How about $25,000?
- We'll have it for you within the hour.

08:43.231 --> 08:45.664
Okay, I'm gonna swap
out the mock turtleneck

08:45.665 --> 08:48.261
for this mock-mock turtleneck, all right?

08:48.262 --> 08:50.916
You stay down here and make sure Josh
doesn't come out of his office. Okay?

08:50.919 --> 08:52.747
And make sure he doesn't come upstairs.

08:53.384 --> 08:54.584
Girl, please.

08:54.585 --> 08:56.545
You think Li'l So So was born yesterday?

08:57.779 --> 08:59.373
The game don't run me, I run the...

08:59.398 --> 09:00.918
- Hey, Sof!
- Josh!

09:01.054 --> 09:03.089
Turtleneck! Josh turtleneck!

09:03.851 --> 09:05.192
Not just any turtleneck.

09:05.193 --> 09:07.454
This is my lucky turtleneck.

09:07.487 --> 09:08.897
Gabi got this for me and bam!

09:08.898 --> 09:10.502
My app sales have skyrocketed.

09:10.503 --> 09:12.140
- This shirt is a winner.
- Ah-ha...

09:12.316 --> 09:13.516
Josh!

09:13.528 --> 09:16.116
You're wearing the
turtleneck that I got you.

09:16.117 --> 09:19.118
That's why it's not in your bedroom...

09:19.565 --> 09:20.894
I would imagine.

09:21.150 --> 09:24.187
This shirt has changed my life.

09:25.454 --> 09:26.687
Hear that, Gabi?

09:26.688 --> 09:28.255
Isn't that fantastic?

09:29.006 --> 09:30.479
I'm never taking it off.

09:31.169 --> 09:32.369
Never!

09:33.901 --> 09:36.468
Never? I mean Josh, what about, ah...

09:36.469 --> 09:38.072
what about when you go to sleep?

09:38.073 --> 09:39.273
No.

09:39.543 --> 09:42.779
Well, what about...
what about on Halloween?

09:43.037 --> 09:44.918
- I'll go as Steve Jobs.
- Dammit.

09:48.514 --> 09:50.876
Well, what about when
you go on a bike ride?

09:50.877 --> 09:52.828
Gabi, of course I'm going
to take it off if I go on a

09:52.829 --> 09:54.581
bike ride. I'm not going to get it sweaty.

09:54.582 --> 09:55.909
You know, you're all wound up.

09:55.934 --> 09:57.702
I think you need to go on a bike ride.

09:57.703 --> 09:58.903
Uh-huh. Sofia, he's tight.

09:58.904 --> 10:00.551
- Feel him. He's very tight.
- Ooh, ooh...

10:00.770 --> 10:03.038
Ooh, he is tight.

10:03.039 --> 10:04.737
Guys, today is my launch day.

10:04.893 --> 10:06.803
All I want to do is sit at my computer

10:06.804 --> 10:08.395
and see how many people download my app

10:08.396 --> 10:10.442
while wearing my lucky magic turtleneck.

10:12.909 --> 10:16.254
Mm! Looks like someone
loves the gift Gabi got them.

10:17.593 --> 10:19.223
Unlike my bobblehead,

10:19.258 --> 10:21.164
which I didn't see in your office.

10:23.420 --> 10:25.263
Oh, well... um, yeah...

10:25.264 --> 10:26.864
ah... that's 'cause I moved it.

10:26.899 --> 10:28.733
Oh, thank God.

10:28.767 --> 10:30.935
You know, I was scared
that you didn't like it.

10:30.936 --> 10:33.771
My ex Coleman once threw out
a gift that I gave him and I...

10:33.772 --> 10:34.972
I was crushed.

10:34.973 --> 10:36.569
I remember it to this day.

10:37.041 --> 10:39.009
Oh. Yolanda...

10:39.179 --> 10:40.940
I'd never throw your gift away.

10:41.086 --> 10:42.286
Good.

10:42.367 --> 10:43.674
So, where is it?

10:46.597 --> 10:49.158
Um... I had a messenger pick it up

10:49.321 --> 10:51.204
and they took it to my corporate office

10:51.205 --> 10:53.791
downtown so all the
people there could see it.

10:53.792 --> 10:55.959
Oh, I am so flattered!

10:55.960 --> 10:57.168
You know, I would love to see

10:57.169 --> 10:58.796
the people enjoying it.

10:58.797 --> 11:00.965
How 'bout we go to your
corporate office right now?

11:01.180 --> 11:03.226
Ah, you know, I'd love to but I'm...

11:03.227 --> 11:05.670
- Going on a bike ride.
- Going on a bike ride.

11:13.102 --> 11:15.203
Josh, why did you want
me to meet you in here?

11:15.204 --> 11:17.288
Oh, I see. Let me catch up.

11:17.926 --> 11:19.126
Knock it off!

11:19.245 --> 11:21.759
It's cool with Alan, you're
one of my free passes.

11:21.760 --> 11:23.894
Elliot! No.

11:23.956 --> 11:26.374
Look, I need you to
get Yolanda's gift back.

11:26.598 --> 11:27.979
From the trash.

11:28.026 --> 11:29.927
You threw her gift away?

11:29.962 --> 11:31.996
I had to! That thing was freaking me out.

11:32.030 --> 11:33.898
Who cares why? You like mine better!

11:33.932 --> 11:35.533
Are you going to help me, Elliot?

11:35.567 --> 11:37.076
Absolutely.

11:37.496 --> 11:39.330
I'll push on the little pedal-y thing

11:39.331 --> 11:40.945
and you'll reach in and grab it.

11:42.198 --> 11:43.999
No, not this trash.

11:44.002 --> 11:45.735
I threw it down the building's trash chute.

11:47.203 --> 11:48.899
No. I'm not going down there.

11:49.777 --> 11:51.407
I'll give you a thousand dollars.

11:52.892 --> 11:54.626
No, I'm still not going down there.

11:54.886 --> 11:56.086
$2,000.

11:57.990 --> 11:59.890
The higher the amount, the funnier it gets.

12:01.130 --> 12:02.972
Fine. I'll pay for your wedding.

12:03.680 --> 12:04.966
My Hawaiian wedding on a yacht

12:04.973 --> 12:07.354
with Celine Dion singing
the love song from "Titanic?"

12:07.360 --> 12:08.560
Done!

12:08.561 --> 12:10.602
I'm the queen of the world!

12:15.415 --> 12:17.216
All right guys, see you in a bit.

12:18.158 --> 12:20.259
Uh...

12:20.260 --> 12:21.935
Hmm...

12:21.966 --> 12:23.166
Is, ah...

12:24.485 --> 12:26.466
Is the bike ride really
a good idea with the

12:26.637 --> 12:28.949
turtleneck wrapped around your waist?

12:29.930 --> 12:32.056
Uh... she's right, Josh. You know, it could

12:32.057 --> 12:33.998
get caught in a spoke or blow in the wind.

12:33.999 --> 12:37.088
Yeah, yeah. Well, you know, it
is the windy city, after all.

12:38.594 --> 12:39.794
That's Chicago.

12:41.143 --> 12:44.103
But you guys might be right. I
don't want anything to happen to it.

12:44.168 --> 12:45.669
Here. Don't take your eyes off it.

12:45.670 --> 12:46.938
I won't.

12:46.939 --> 12:48.061
You know what? I can't do it.

12:48.062 --> 12:50.448
- I need my turtleneck back.
- Oh, ooh...

12:50.449 --> 12:51.649
Okay.

12:55.912 --> 12:57.251
Tie it around my neck.

12:58.075 --> 12:59.275
Like a cape.

13:00.590 --> 13:02.158
Didn't think of that one, did you Gabi?

13:02.159 --> 13:03.926
Nope Josh. You've found a way

13:03.927 --> 13:06.229
to make turtlenecks even cooler.

13:06.955 --> 13:08.200
Yes.

13:08.705 --> 13:09.905
Yes I did.

13:11.196 --> 13:14.247
We did it! The ol' switcheroo.

13:14.596 --> 13:15.799
Now all we got to do is wait

13:15.800 --> 13:17.189
for him to get in the elevator.

13:17.190 --> 13:18.666
$25,000 one...

13:18.667 --> 13:20.720
(Both) $25,000 two...

13:20.721 --> 13:22.921
$25,000 three...

13:22.922 --> 13:24.072
Let's go!

13:24.073 --> 13:25.428
(Both singing) ♪ $25,000 ♪

13:25.429 --> 13:27.209
♪ $25,000 ♪

13:27.210 --> 13:28.478
♪ $25... ♪ Josh!

13:28.479 --> 13:29.983
Can't go on a bike ride...

13:32.250 --> 13:33.559
...without my bike.

13:35.292 --> 13:36.578
No sir, you cannot.

13:36.579 --> 13:37.835
You go get that bike.

13:37.836 --> 13:39.436
Oh my God, that was so close.

13:39.437 --> 13:41.371
Okay, let's hurry. Let's get to Lilly's.

13:41.626 --> 13:42.922
Where's the shirt?

13:43.257 --> 13:44.465
Um...

13:44.763 --> 13:46.813
(Sofia) Nooo!

13:49.934 --> 13:51.594
Okay, I'm just going to
say this one more time.

13:51.595 --> 13:53.007
This is the dumbest thing you've ever done.

13:53.008 --> 13:56.500
Okay, who's dumber? The dummy? Or the
dummy that threw the shirt to the dummy?

13:57.936 --> 13:59.816
Okay. Let's just get
it and get out of here.

13:59.817 --> 14:00.866
Okay.

14:00.867 --> 14:02.172
(Both) Go get it!

14:02.205 --> 14:03.405
(Both) Me?

14:04.417 --> 14:06.117
Fine, we'll both go.

14:06.246 --> 14:07.446
Aw!

14:11.220 --> 14:12.420
Ugh!

14:13.670 --> 14:15.738
Ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew...

14:15.739 --> 14:17.688
Yeah okay, we're not even
in there yet, princess.

14:19.516 --> 14:21.290
Ugh-ha, ha!

14:21.973 --> 14:23.173
Ugh!

14:23.272 --> 14:24.897
What if there's a rat in here?

14:25.264 --> 14:27.098
- (Gabi and Sofia scream)
- What are you two doing here?

14:27.099 --> 14:28.933
Did Josh send you to
look for the bobblehead?

14:28.934 --> 14:30.707
Well too bad, it's mine!

14:30.708 --> 14:32.909
We're not looking for a
bobblehead. We're looking for...

14:33.292 --> 14:35.326
What? What? Is there something on me?

14:35.327 --> 14:36.546
(Both) Yes!

14:36.581 --> 14:38.281
Where? Where is it? Where is it?

14:38.316 --> 14:39.593
On your head...

14:44.876 --> 14:46.076
Ah!

14:47.191 --> 14:49.289
Oh, Elliot found it!

15:00.747 --> 15:03.382
Elliot, thank you for
finding the bobblehead.

15:03.383 --> 15:05.488
Okay, now I need you to
take it to my downtown office

15:05.489 --> 15:07.019
so tomorrow when Yolanda goes...

15:07.393 --> 15:08.682
What do you mean you didn't find it?

15:08.683 --> 15:10.002
I just put it in the cupboard.

15:11.616 --> 15:13.116
Ah!

15:16.099 --> 15:17.534
I'll call you back.

15:19.047 --> 15:21.182
Okay, breathe.

15:21.270 --> 15:22.779
It's a bobblehead.

15:22.780 --> 15:24.305
Logical explanation for all of this.

15:28.572 --> 15:29.934
Did I scare you, baby?

15:29.935 --> 15:32.196
Sorry, I was just taking out the trash.

15:32.197 --> 15:33.637
You know, the place
where you throw things out

15:33.638 --> 15:35.472
you don't want, like eggshells,

15:35.505 --> 15:37.894
dirty paper towels, heartfelt gifts...

15:37.926 --> 15:40.343
Like a one of a kind
made-to-order bobblehead?

15:41.483 --> 15:43.246
- So you know?
- Yes, I know.

15:43.247 --> 15:44.535
I found it in the trash.

15:44.536 --> 15:46.036
Oh, you found it. Thank God.

15:46.037 --> 15:47.597
So you were the one moving it around?

15:47.598 --> 15:49.186
'Course I was.

15:49.187 --> 15:51.054
You don't think it walked
over there by itself, did you?

15:51.055 --> 15:52.741
(Laughing)

15:52.742 --> 15:53.942
No.

15:55.126 --> 15:57.094
An-and... and you were
the one doing the voice?

15:57.128 --> 15:58.808
- No. What voice?
- Nothing!

16:00.898 --> 16:02.765
Yolanda, I know I shouldn't
have thrown it away

16:02.766 --> 16:04.423
but my launch day was making me crazy

16:04.424 --> 16:06.744
and staring at my own head
just bobbling around judging me,

16:06.769 --> 16:08.300
I overreacted.

16:08.740 --> 16:10.121
I guess I understand, Josh.

16:10.122 --> 16:12.865
I mean, it it is a little creepy looking.

16:13.340 --> 16:15.317
- The doll, not your head.
- Oh.

16:15.365 --> 16:16.747
Nice head.

16:17.248 --> 16:18.448
Seriously, I felt so bad.

16:18.449 --> 16:20.350
I have Elliot in the dumpster
right now looking for it.

16:20.351 --> 16:22.251
- Oh. Eh-eh...
- Gonna tell him to get out.

16:22.453 --> 16:24.321
You really want to make this up to me?

16:24.379 --> 16:25.755
You know I do.

16:25.821 --> 16:27.655
Hold off on that phone call.

16:29.793 --> 16:31.661
Come on, Elliot. Just give us the shirt.

16:31.662 --> 16:33.547
I would, except no.

16:34.451 --> 16:37.525
Something smells funny, and it's not just

16:37.526 --> 16:39.494
the wood shavings from that hamster cage

16:39.495 --> 16:41.139
that's filling my loafer.

16:41.639 --> 16:44.441
Why would two girls crawl through filth

16:44.475 --> 16:46.376
for an ugly polyblend shirt?

16:46.410 --> 16:48.378
Exactly. It's just a worthless shirt.

16:48.412 --> 16:50.523
Oh, so then you won't mind

16:50.524 --> 16:51.912
if I use this shirt

16:51.913 --> 16:53.885
to wipe up this unidentified sludge

16:53.886 --> 16:55.642
that you better hope
to God is Greek yogurt.

16:55.643 --> 16:57.013
(Both) No, no, no, no!

16:58.418 --> 17:00.304
Elliot, it doesn't matter
why we want the shirt.

17:00.305 --> 17:01.771
Okay? Just give it to us!

17:01.772 --> 17:03.474
Here's how this is gonna go down.

17:03.475 --> 17:04.756
You find my bobblehead,

17:04.757 --> 17:06.724
I give you this hideous shirt

17:06.726 --> 17:08.829
and we all walk out of here winners.

17:21.249 --> 17:22.883
A Pro Wong's take out?

17:25.415 --> 17:27.284
Well, that's the end of our trash,

17:27.318 --> 17:28.663
but here's a little something

17:28.664 --> 17:31.788
compliments of Miss
Finkel and her twelve cats.

17:36.694 --> 17:38.094
- Oh!
- Whoa!

17:40.765 --> 17:43.532
(Screaming and crying)

17:43.601 --> 17:45.281
Elliot, it's not here!

17:45.308 --> 17:46.703
Keep looking.

17:46.737 --> 17:49.054
Leave no adult diaper unturned.

17:49.507 --> 17:51.149
No, no, no!

17:51.434 --> 17:52.864
Stop it! Stop!

17:53.177 --> 17:55.281
I just thought of another way to do this.

17:55.917 --> 17:58.312
- Get him!
- (Elliot) Ah!

18:01.319 --> 18:03.220
Yolanda!

18:03.254 --> 18:05.222
You're right. That is rude.

18:05.256 --> 18:07.136
Elliot likes cream with his coffee.

18:08.059 --> 18:10.861
I think he's had enough. Throw him a bone.

18:10.895 --> 18:14.029
I did better than that.
I threw a whole chicken!

18:15.763 --> 18:17.219
All right.

18:20.644 --> 18:22.111
It's two against one!

18:22.112 --> 18:23.352
How are you so strong?

18:23.353 --> 18:25.163
Do you know how many
Barney's warehouse sales

18:25.164 --> 18:26.471
I've been to, bitches?

18:27.091 --> 18:28.345
(Chute rattles)

18:28.379 --> 18:29.669
Incoming!

18:31.640 --> 18:33.027
No!

18:33.215 --> 18:34.415
Oh!

18:34.416 --> 18:36.317
Oh my God! It's the bobblehead!

18:36.318 --> 18:38.005
Here's your shirt, bitches!

18:43.828 --> 18:45.028
I just took a second shower

18:45.062 --> 18:47.022
and I still smell like hot and sour soup.

18:48.471 --> 18:49.827
Third one's the charm.

18:50.359 --> 18:51.635
No, it's not.

18:52.684 --> 18:54.519
We were so close to being rich.

18:54.520 --> 18:57.155
I know. I had big plans for that money.

18:57.178 --> 18:59.413
I was going to pay off my student loans...

18:59.610 --> 19:01.635
...while lying on a beach in Cabo.

19:02.313 --> 19:05.115
Yeah, well we're not going
to Cabo. You want to know why?

19:05.149 --> 19:07.629
Because you have terrible,
terrible instincts?

19:08.704 --> 19:10.772
No, because we were greedy.

19:10.860 --> 19:13.271
We never should have taken
that shirt back from Josh.

19:13.720 --> 19:15.886
Let's make a pact right now to never

19:15.887 --> 19:17.738
let ourselves be controlled by greed.

19:17.822 --> 19:19.022
Done.

19:19.342 --> 19:20.542
(Knocking)

19:21.933 --> 19:23.833
Hey ladies, where's the shirt?

19:23.880 --> 19:26.148
Well, it's torn.

19:26.214 --> 19:28.070
Greed ripped it in half.

19:29.341 --> 19:30.929
I'm gonna rip you both in half,

19:30.946 --> 19:32.411
give me that shirt.

19:32.808 --> 19:35.543
Wait a minute, this isn't
the shirt I sold you.

19:35.544 --> 19:36.477
What?

19:36.478 --> 19:38.691
You think Steve Jobs wore a woman's medium?

19:40.557 --> 19:42.001
What? Oh my God. Oh my God.

19:42.002 --> 19:44.041
That means Elliot must have had
a different shirt on his head.

19:44.042 --> 19:45.910
That means the real shirt
is still in the... h...

19:45.911 --> 19:47.571
I'm going to Cabo!

19:53.036 --> 19:55.379
Eh, I could get a couple of bucks for this.

20:00.998 --> 20:03.733
Hey Josh, it's laundry day.

20:03.741 --> 20:04.982
Hint hint.

20:05.016 --> 20:08.128
And by hint hint, I mean take off
the damn shirt because you stink.

20:08.666 --> 20:10.731
Sorry, Yolanda. Not taking it off.

20:10.732 --> 20:12.549
My app has been crushing it all week.

20:12.757 --> 20:14.158
Please?

20:14.192 --> 20:16.405
I mean, I'll have it
back to you in 90 minutes.

20:16.406 --> 20:18.476
Sorry, I'm not taking that risk.

20:18.477 --> 20:20.030
Now please tell Gabi
I'm ready for my lunch.

20:20.031 --> 20:21.231
Okay.

20:23.878 --> 20:25.138
Yes!

20:25.296 --> 20:26.496
Whoo!

20:28.393 --> 20:29.950
Maybe she's right.

20:36.008 --> 20:37.208
Gabi!

20:38.976 --> 20:41.131
Josh is ready for his lunch!

20:41.694 --> 20:43.279
(Gabi) Be up in a sec!
