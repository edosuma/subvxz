01:03.480 --> 01:05.022
And with that,

01:05.272 --> 01:07.859
{\an1}the Rocket family
Christmas traditions

01:07.942 --> 01:09.736
have officially begun.

01:13.031 --> 01:15.658
{\an5}(<i> quietly</i> ):
Do we actually
like this stuff?

01:15.909 --> 01:17.285
I wouldn't know.

01:17.535 --> 01:19.329
{\an1}Every year
Dad buys it for me,

01:19.579 --> 01:21.331
{\an5}and every year
I dump it
in the trash.

01:21.581 --> 01:22.916
You know, I remember
the first Christmas

01:23.249 --> 01:24.459
we came down here in...

01:24.709 --> 01:26.002
Whoa...

01:26.085 --> 01:29.631
{\an1}Whoa...

01:29.881 --> 01:32.884
{\an5}A classic
ten-foot
longboard.

01:32.967 --> 01:35.178
{\an1}Man's greatest
invention to-date.

01:35.261 --> 01:36.262
Whoa.

01:36.513 --> 01:37.597
Hello, Dad?

01:37.847 --> 01:39.349
Come back to us.

01:39.599 --> 01:42.018
Go away
from the light.

01:42.101 --> 01:43.561
Oh,
snap.

01:43.812 --> 01:45.396
{\an4}Look
at that
longboard.

01:45.647 --> 01:47.023
It's tight,
huh?

01:47.273 --> 01:48.858
The tightest.

01:48.942 --> 01:50.276
Unfortunately,
so is my wallet.

01:50.527 --> 01:51.653
Oh, well.

01:51.903 --> 01:52.946
Oh, got to go.

01:53.238 --> 01:55.323
Got to get the supplies

01:55.573 --> 01:57.283
for tonight's annual Rocket
Christmas Paper Chain Party.

01:57.534 --> 01:58.952
Oh... right.

01:59.202 --> 02:01.329
{\an1}So, uh, we're
still doing that?

02:01.579 --> 02:02.705
You bet.

02:02.956 --> 02:03.832
Don't worry, Reg.

02:04.123 --> 02:05.542
I know how much

02:05.792 --> 02:06.835
you kids look forward to it.

02:07.085 --> 02:07.919
See you then.

02:08.002 --> 02:08.419
{\an1}Whoa.

02:09.838 --> 02:11.422
Paper chain party?

02:11.673 --> 02:14.008
Didn't we 86 that,
like, four years ago?

02:14.092 --> 02:15.468
{\an1}I wish.

02:15.718 --> 02:17.512
What's up with the dog, Twist?

02:17.762 --> 02:19.305
{\an1}I'm walking her
for Mrs. Maze

02:19.556 --> 02:21.391
{\an1}while she does
her Christmas shopping.

02:21.641 --> 02:24.477
{\an5}Dude, couldn't
you baby-sit
a cooler dog?

02:24.727 --> 02:25.812
{\an1}Oh, yeah?

02:26.062 --> 02:27.021
Check this out.

02:27.105 --> 02:28.106
{\an1}Fifi, up.

02:28.189 --> 02:29.649
{\an1}Sit up.

02:29.899 --> 02:31.276
{\an1}Come on, girl,
sit up.

02:31.359 --> 02:32.443
{\an1}Play dead.

02:32.527 --> 02:33.486
{\an1}Come on!

02:33.736 --> 02:34.821
{\an1}Play dead!

02:35.155 --> 02:37.198
Not exactly Lassie, is she?

02:37.448 --> 02:39.158
{\an4}Well, at least
I'm getting 20 bucks
for taking care of her.

02:39.409 --> 02:40.994
{\an3}No way!

02:41.286 --> 02:42.871
An Andrew Jackson
just to watch a dog?

02:43.121 --> 02:44.747
That's sweet!

02:44.998 --> 02:46.249
Sure-- a lot of people
need dog walkers

02:46.499 --> 02:48.084
this time of year.

02:48.167 --> 02:49.627
Otto, we can
walk dogs, too,

02:49.878 --> 02:51.129
and make
some serious coin.

02:51.379 --> 02:53.047
We have
three whole days

02:53.131 --> 02:54.465
to cash in
on the Christmas rush.

02:54.716 --> 02:56.175
Yeah...

02:56.426 --> 02:58.052
{\an1}I could get new trucks
for my board

02:58.136 --> 02:59.929
or nice pegs for my bike.

03:00.013 --> 03:02.015
Or we could get
Dad the surfboard.

03:02.307 --> 03:05.476
{\an4}Or three dozen
of those sticky hands
from the gum machine.

03:05.727 --> 03:07.937
Or we could get Dad
the surfboard.

03:08.021 --> 03:10.189
{\an1}Or we could get Dad
the surfboard

03:10.440 --> 03:14.193
and this will be the most
wicked, sick Christmas ever.

03:14.444 --> 03:15.445
(<i> barks</i> )

03:17.030 --> 03:21.784
(<i> men talking</i> )

03:22.035 --> 03:23.244
Now, gentlemen,

03:23.494 --> 03:25.038
as you know,
each year

03:25.330 --> 03:27.248
this mall chooses
the Santa's helper

03:27.498 --> 03:29.584
who we think best represents
the big guy himself,

03:29.834 --> 03:31.961
to make an appearance at the
Mayor's Christmas Eve Ball.

03:32.045 --> 03:35.381
That means I have three days
to turn you sorry sacks of coal

03:35.632 --> 03:37.342
{\an1}into something
you can be proud of.

03:37.425 --> 03:38.384
{\an1}Makani!

03:38.635 --> 03:40.053
Yes, sir.

03:40.303 --> 03:41.971
{\an1}You want to be
the mayor's Santa?

03:42.055 --> 03:43.848
Yes, sir!
It would be an honor.

03:44.098 --> 03:46.684
It would be a miracle
is what it would be.

03:46.935 --> 03:48.519
{\an1}Are you
eyeballing me, boy?

03:48.770 --> 03:50.480
{\an1}Don't you
eyeball me, Makani.

03:50.730 --> 03:51.856
I got ears.

03:52.106 --> 03:53.983
And my ears hear

03:54.067 --> 03:56.736
{\an1}that you've added the word
"bruddah" to your "ho-ho-ho."

03:56.986 --> 03:58.154
Is that correct?

03:58.237 --> 03:59.238
Well, yeah, bruddah.

03:59.489 --> 04:00.698
I... I mean sir.

04:00.949 --> 04:02.617
Uh, sometimes I...

04:02.867 --> 04:04.202
There is no "bruddah"
in "ho-ho-ho."

04:04.285 --> 04:05.870
{\an1}Got it?

04:06.120 --> 04:07.038
The laugh is
"ho-ho-ho."

04:07.121 --> 04:07.330
{\an1}That's it.

04:11.668 --> 04:13.670
REGGIE:
<i>Uh-huh, we can pick up Spot</i>

04:13.920 --> 04:15.713
first thing in the A.M.

04:15.964 --> 04:18.132
Uh-huh, you pay
when we drop him back off.

04:18.216 --> 04:21.135
Yes, yes, we can accommodate
a vegetarian diet.

04:21.219 --> 04:22.595
Yes! Got another one!

04:22.845 --> 04:24.430
All these dogs.

04:24.681 --> 04:26.724
Man, we're going
to be rolling in it.

04:28.434 --> 04:29.936
What did I say?

04:30.186 --> 04:32.355
Reg, look
at this Santa.

04:32.605 --> 04:35.191
You made it when you were
only five years old.

04:35.274 --> 04:36.818
(<i> giggles nervously</i> )

04:37.068 --> 04:38.695
H-hard to believe,
huh, Dad?

04:38.945 --> 04:40.697
You know, this is
the first Christmas

04:40.947 --> 04:42.323
I'll be able to buy junk
for all the Rodriguezes.

04:42.573 --> 04:43.992
And I can finely
get my mom

04:44.242 --> 04:45.660
the new weed butcher

04:45.910 --> 04:47.078
with the 200-foot
extension cord

04:47.370 --> 04:49.038
and all the attachments!

04:49.122 --> 04:50.707
You sure that's
what she wants?

04:50.957 --> 04:51.666
Who wouldn't?

04:51.916 --> 04:53.167
{\an6}Uh...

04:53.251 --> 04:53.501
A little help here.

04:55.169 --> 04:56.587
(<i> grunting</i> )

04:56.838 --> 04:58.214
{\an1}Dang-- what's
in here, Raymundo,

04:58.298 --> 04:59.799
{\an1}the Christmas
brick?

05:00.049 --> 05:02.010
{\an1}The display
for the roof.

05:02.260 --> 05:03.344
{\an1}I put in an extra circuit
just to handle the wattage.

05:08.224 --> 05:11.602
Reg, is that you on Santa's lap
with no teeth?

05:11.853 --> 05:13.563
Uh, no, that's
some other girl

05:13.646 --> 05:15.148
{\an5}who looks
remarkably
like me...

05:15.398 --> 05:17.233
with her picture
in our family album.

05:17.316 --> 05:19.277
{\an1}Who's that baby
crying next to you?

05:19.527 --> 05:21.362
RAYMUNDO:
Uh, that's Otto.

05:21.612 --> 05:23.531
I remember that Christmas
like it was yesterday.

05:23.781 --> 05:25.158
I'm sure you do,

05:25.450 --> 05:26.909
{\an1}and we'd love
to hear about it,

05:27.160 --> 05:28.411
but we got to walk some dogs.

05:28.661 --> 05:30.038
{\an1}Otto! Reg!
Don't forget--

05:30.288 --> 05:32.206
tonight's the Rocket Christmas

05:32.290 --> 05:34.792
Gingerbread Village
Construction Party.

05:35.043 --> 05:36.085
Don't worry, Dad.

05:36.169 --> 05:37.545
We'll be there.

05:37.795 --> 05:39.839
RAYMUNDO:
Great.

05:40.089 --> 05:41.841
And afterwards we can all sing
the Kringle Dingle song

05:42.091 --> 05:43.718
and dance the Antler Dance.

05:43.968 --> 05:45.094
OTTO:
Can't wait.

05:45.845 --> 05:48.181
Thanks for walking Byron, man.

05:48.431 --> 05:50.850
Here's his leash
and his scrunchie.

05:51.100 --> 05:53.102
He's very versatile.

05:53.186 --> 05:55.438
{\an1}Anything special we need
to know about Officer Zeke?

05:55.688 --> 05:57.231
{\an1}If he sees a crime
in progress,

05:57.482 --> 05:59.233
{\an1}he may go after
the perp.

05:59.317 --> 06:01.110
So I would avoid
bank robberies.

06:01.194 --> 06:03.696
Now, you take darn
good care with Rex.

06:03.946 --> 06:05.948
{\an1}He's a pure-bred
wiener dog.

06:06.199 --> 06:07.742
Oh, and remember
to keep him

06:07.992 --> 06:10.244
in that cutie-pootie
sweater I made.

06:10.328 --> 06:12.914
He doesn't like to
go out without it.

06:13.164 --> 06:16.417
Clyde is an extremely
disciplined guard dog.

06:16.667 --> 06:20.254
I've trained him
to be strong, alert,

06:20.338 --> 06:23.257
and when necessary, deadly.

06:23.341 --> 06:26.177
He looks about as deadly
as a sand flea.

06:26.844 --> 06:28.429
This dog-walking
thing

06:28.679 --> 06:30.890
is going to be
a piece of cake.

06:31.140 --> 06:32.308
Heel, boy.

06:32.558 --> 06:34.393
Otto! Help me!

06:34.644 --> 06:36.270
(<i> dog growling</i> )

06:36.354 --> 06:37.772
One, two, three,

06:38.022 --> 06:39.107
{\an1}pull!

06:41.400 --> 06:44.821
You think Officer Zeke will
fine himself for littering?

06:46.405 --> 06:48.783
Byron, get back here!

06:49.033 --> 06:51.786
Reg, walk the greyhound
for a while?

06:52.036 --> 06:53.996
My legs feel
like rubber.

06:54.247 --> 06:56.457
{\an1}Don't tell me walking
a little, old dog

06:56.707 --> 06:58.292
is too extreme
for you, Sammy.

06:58.584 --> 07:00.128
Easy for you to say.

07:00.378 --> 07:02.130
You got
the basset hound.

07:02.380 --> 07:05.216
That guy goes from zero
to ten in two days.

07:05.299 --> 07:07.301
Wait-- where's my
miniature poodle?

07:07.385 --> 07:09.720
{\an5}I think it went
poop-doggy-dog
back here.

07:09.971 --> 07:11.597
And it's not
so miniature.

07:11.848 --> 07:15.351
Aw, great-- we have
to clean that up.

07:15.434 --> 07:16.936
No,<i> we</i> don't.

Byron, stay!

07:30.324 --> 07:31.617
Stay, boy, stay!

07:33.119 --> 07:34.912
I am so beat right now.

07:35.163 --> 07:37.415
{\an1}I could crash
until New Year's.

07:37.498 --> 07:38.708
Oh, me, too.

07:38.958 --> 07:40.334
Well, maybe Dad forgot

07:40.585 --> 07:41.794
about the whole
Christmas deal

07:42.044 --> 07:43.171
and went to bed early.

{\an1}we'd still be building
that gingerbread metropolis.

{\an1}Besides, we have
too much to do today.

We got to find
a way to bail.

18:17.805 --> 18:18.555
<i>check behind the tree.</i>

18:27.314 --> 18:29.525
<i>Feliz Navidad,</i> Tito.

18:29.775 --> 18:30.859
Got to go.

18:31.151 --> 18:32.277
(<i> dog whining</i> )

18:32.528 --> 18:33.779
What's that, girl?

18:34.029 --> 18:35.697
(<i> whining</i> )

18:35.948 --> 18:37.866
The kids are chasing dogs
all over town

18:37.950 --> 18:39.993
and they won't make it to
the surfboard store on time,

18:40.077 --> 18:41.703
and Christmas will be a bust?

18:41.954 --> 18:42.955
Oh, no!

18:43.247 --> 18:44.581
We got to do something.

18:48.377 --> 18:49.920
{\an4}REGGIE:
He's the last one,
Otto.

18:50.170 --> 18:52.005
Hurry up, we've got
seven minutes left

18:52.089 --> 18:53.799
{\an1}to get to the store
before it closes!

18:56.218 --> 18:58.595
OTTO:
Where are the rest of them?

18:58.846 --> 19:00.848
{\an1}Get on, we can make it
to the board shop.

19:01.098 --> 19:02.724
{\an1}Ho-ho-ho, boy,
we better hurry.

19:02.975 --> 19:04.643
But, Tito, we still
haven't been paid

19:04.893 --> 19:06.353
by the rest of
the customers.

19:06.603 --> 19:08.063
Yeah, we won't have
enough money.

19:08.146 --> 19:09.940
Santa took care of everything;

19:10.023 --> 19:11.441
your customers are
meeting you there.

19:11.692 --> 19:13.902
Dash away, dash away, dogs.

19:13.986 --> 19:14.820
Bust a move!

19:18.574 --> 19:20.450
Ho-ho-ho-ho.

19:20.701 --> 19:22.035
Ho-ho-ho-ho.

19:22.119 --> 19:23.745
Hey,<i> Mele Kalikimaka.</i>

19:23.996 --> 19:27.082
Merry Christmas!

19:27.165 --> 19:28.542
(<i> people cheering</i> )

19:28.792 --> 19:29.918
On, Fifi, on, Zeke!

19:30.168 --> 19:31.253
{\an1}TITO:
Let's move!

19:31.336 --> 19:32.838
{\an1}He-haw!

19:33.088 --> 19:34.256
Merry Christmas,
man.

19:34.506 --> 19:34.756
MAN:
Merry Christmas.

19:37.009 --> 19:38.427
(<i> dogs barking</i> )

19:38.677 --> 19:40.929
{\an1}Oh, yay!

19:41.013 --> 19:42.014
Sixty seconds,
Otto!

19:42.306 --> 19:43.974
I'm done, Reg.

19:48.145 --> 19:51.523
Where's the money sack?

19:51.773 --> 19:53.317
{\an1}Oh, no,
it must have...

19:53.400 --> 19:54.234
Otto, no!

19:59.156 --> 20:00.282
(<i> sighs</i> )

20:02.075 --> 20:03.327
Not now, boy.

20:05.412 --> 20:06.371
Yes!

20:06.622 --> 20:07.706
All right.

20:07.956 --> 20:08.916
Good boy, Byron,

20:09.166 --> 20:10.459
good boy.

20:14.504 --> 20:17.049
I think I figured you
all wrong, Makani.

20:17.341 --> 20:19.801
{\an1}By the look of things,
I'd say you're a natural.

20:20.052 --> 20:22.221
{\an1}How'd you like to come down
to the Mayor's Ball

20:22.471 --> 20:23.972
and sit in
Santa's chair?

20:24.056 --> 20:25.098
You mean it?

20:25.390 --> 20:27.017
What about Peterson?

20:27.100 --> 20:28.769
He's done it
nine years in a row.

20:29.019 --> 20:30.020
Time for a change,
don't you think?

20:40.072 --> 20:42.783
BOTH:
Merry Christmas, Raymundo.

20:43.033 --> 20:44.368
{\an1}Why are you wearing
those hats?

20:44.618 --> 20:46.536
It's Christmas Eve.

20:46.787 --> 20:48.580
{\an5}And this is what
the Rockets do
on Christmas Eve.

20:48.830 --> 20:50.374
I've been thinking
about that and...

20:50.624 --> 20:52.376
So have we.

20:52.626 --> 20:53.877
{\an5}We're sorry
we messed up
everything.

20:54.127 --> 20:55.754
You were right, Dad,

20:56.004 --> 20:57.005
Christmas is all about
traditions.

20:57.089 --> 20:58.173
Not exactly.

20:58.256 --> 21:00.092
{\an1}You see...

21:00.342 --> 21:02.552
I kept those traditions going
all these years

21:02.803 --> 21:05.138
because your mom loved them
so much when you were little.

21:05.222 --> 21:07.015
But I think what
really mattered to Mom

21:07.265 --> 21:09.267
was that we spend time together
as a family.

21:18.110 --> 21:21.363
The longboard from the window?

21:21.613 --> 21:24.366
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

21:24.616 --> 21:26.243
Step away from
the light, Dad.

21:26.493 --> 21:28.286
But... how?

21:28.537 --> 21:32.040
{\an4}Let's just say
this Christmas
went to the dogs.

21:32.124 --> 21:34.334
(<i> laughs</i> )

21:34.584 --> 21:36.128
Wow, it's really great.

21:36.420 --> 21:38.213
And I've got something
for you guys, too.

21:38.463 --> 21:40.215
I was saving them

21:40.298 --> 21:41.591
until I felt that
you were old enough.

21:42.884 --> 21:44.428
Whoa.

21:44.511 --> 21:46.221
Those were
your mom's.

21:46.304 --> 21:48.181
That's a gold coin
from a sunken ship

21:48.265 --> 21:50.058
off the coast
of Barbados.

21:50.350 --> 21:52.519
Mom found it on one of her
scuba diving expeditions.

21:52.769 --> 21:54.146
Whoa.

21:54.396 --> 21:56.064
{\an1}And, Reg?

21:56.148 --> 21:57.899
{\an1}That's the first prize
Mom ever won

21:58.150 --> 21:59.568
in a surf contest.

21:59.818 --> 22:02.195
{\an1}She couldn't resist
a challenge.

22:02.279 --> 22:03.947
It's the best present
ever.

22:04.197 --> 22:04.906
{\an1}Ditto.

22:07.284 --> 22:09.119
I think it's about time

22:09.202 --> 22:10.370
the Rockets started
a new Christmas tradition.

22:32.225 --> 22:36.396
