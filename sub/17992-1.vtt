27:15.600 --> 27:17.068
Yes.

27:22.707 --> 27:24.376
You're really
serious about this?

27:24.442 --> 27:25.877
About what?

27:25.944 --> 27:28.780
Moving in?

27:28.847 --> 27:31.549
When I first moved back
to L.A., I decided to move

27:31.616 --> 27:32.951
in with my mom.

27:33.018 --> 27:36.588
Then it got to where I felt like
I needed to find my own place.

27:36.654 --> 27:39.124
{\an5}Of course, I brought it up to
Dre and that's when the

27:39.190 --> 27:41.860
{\an5}subject of moving in
together came about.

27:41.926 --> 27:44.062
There's going to be a process,
it's not just peaches and cream.

27:44.129 --> 27:44.763
A process?

27:44.829 --> 27:46.431
What's the process?

27:46.498 --> 27:48.033
Once we're there, we're there.

27:48.099 --> 27:51.503
Yeah, we're there, but I
don't want us to be arguing

27:51.569 --> 27:52.637
and fighting over stuff.

27:52.704 --> 27:53.738
We don't argue.

27:53.805 --> 27:55.473
I know we don't, I
don't want us to start.

27:55.540 --> 27:56.908
Okay.

27:56.975 --> 28:00.011
You can love someone a lot, but
once you be around a person so

28:00.078 --> 28:04.249
much, you know, stuff happens.

{\an5}I'm turned up,
I'm getting money.

28:06.551 --> 28:08.219
{\an5}I'm young, I'm a leo.

28:08.286 --> 28:10.055
{\an5}I'm rambunctious,
I like to party.

28:10.121 --> 28:12.323
{\an5}And she, she's
like a regular girl.

28:12.390 --> 28:14.826
She's Nia, and that's
what I like about her.

28:14.893 --> 28:17.829
And I really, really,
really want me and Nia to work.

28:17.896 --> 28:19.898

lot of stuff, shoes?

28:19.964 --> 28:23.635
You have more stuff than I have.

28:23.701 --> 28:26.004
Excuse me, someone's hungry.

28:26.071 --> 28:28.940
Yes, I have a one-year-old baby
girl, her name is Cameron and

28:29.007 --> 28:30.842
Dre is not the father.

28:30.909 --> 28:32.877
Dre and I were
teenagers when we first met.

28:32.944 --> 28:36.881
And when he hit it really big
he started living that life.

28:36.948 --> 28:39.117
There was girls and
plenty of groupies.

28:39.184 --> 28:40.885
He definitely really hurt me.

28:40.952 --> 28:43.822
After our last break up I ended
up in another relationship

28:43.888 --> 28:45.423
and I had a baby.

28:45.490 --> 28:48.827
And I feel like this time around
if Dre wants to be with me

28:48.893 --> 28:51.729
and be serious, he also has
to accept the fact

28:51.796 --> 28:53.198
that it's me and her.

28:53.264 --> 28:55.233
You ready to have her in
the house all the time?

28:55.300 --> 28:55.967
Yeah.

28:56.034 --> 28:57.268
You sure?

28:57.335 --> 28:59.003
We gotta child proof everything.

28:59.070 --> 29:00.004
What?

29:00.071 --> 29:02.040
We gotta buy some gates.

29:02.107 --> 29:03.975
We gonna have to do
that before we move in.

29:04.042 --> 29:05.910
She's not going to be crying in
the middle of the night, huh?

29:05.977 --> 29:07.779
No, she's not a crier.

29:07.846 --> 29:10.081

29:10.148 --> 29:12.050
no crying in the middle
of the night.

29:12.117 --> 29:14.819
Dre has no idea what it's
going to be like

29:14.886 --> 29:16.888
living with a toddler.

29:16.955 --> 29:18.189

me and you and I always

that, we weren't together.

29:30.468 --> 29:32.871

29:32.937 --> 29:36.808
I hate that it
happened, but things happen.

29:36.875 --> 29:39.177
If I were to have a kid and she
would have come back to me,

29:39.244 --> 29:41.846
I wouldn't want her to be like,
"Oh, Dre, I'm not [beep] with

the kid if we're going to be

36:31.756 --> 36:34.358
Normally I work great under
pressure, but tonight it's a

36:34.425 --> 36:36.527
little different because I got a
lot of important people coming

36:36.594 --> 36:38.563
out tonight and I kind
of want to impress them.

36:38.629 --> 36:41.465
♪♪

36:41.532 --> 36:43.067
You know, it's a
big night for me.

36:43.134 --> 36:45.336
It's a big night for RayJ.com.

36:45.403 --> 36:46.737
{\an5}I got my girl with me.

36:46.804 --> 36:49.640
{\an5}I got everybody that I got
love for coming through.

36:49.707 --> 36:52.310
So, let's just hope it
turns out to be a great night.

36:52.376 --> 37:05.756
♪♪

37:05.823 --> 37:08.459
Listen, the last thing that I
want to do is go to a party

37:08.526 --> 37:12.563
{\an5}celebrating Ray J, but he did
tell me that his girl threw my

37:12.630 --> 37:15.866
things away, so I
gonna need a check.

37:15.933 --> 37:16.901
I want a drink.

37:16.968 --> 37:22.873
You already had like ten drinks.

37:22.940 --> 37:24.809
But I wanted you to come
because you said you had

37:24.875 --> 37:25.910
some more to say.

37:25.977 --> 37:28.846
I do, but right now
I want an 11th drink.

37:28.913 --> 37:30.047
Oh, my God.

37:30.114 --> 37:31.582
Lord, it just got intense.

37:31.649 --> 37:33.317
I hear Teairra behind me.

37:33.384 --> 37:35.086
What is this, like the
11th drink she's ordering?

37:35.152 --> 37:37.521
And I'm just like, "Why
does she have to come,

37:37.588 --> 37:38.689
{\an5}I really don't want her here."

37:38.756 --> 37:43.160
I sent the invite out,
you know what I'm saying?

37:43.227 --> 37:46.464
So, Princess is standing next
to me and she found a bag that

37:46.530 --> 37:49.700
belonged to Teairra and I guess
she decided to take pictures of

37:49.767 --> 37:50.334
what was in there.

38:02.346 --> 38:06.484
It's like a bag of couchy creams
and receipts and old plane

38:06.550 --> 38:11.455
tickets and parmesan cheese.

38:11.522 --> 38:12.356
Hey.

38:12.423 --> 38:14.892
Thanks for coming.

38:14.959 --> 38:17.061
You look amazing.

38:17.128 --> 38:18.229
Black T.

38:18.295 --> 38:19.797
Black hat.

38:19.864 --> 38:21.499
I didn't think you
was going to come.

38:21.565 --> 38:28.906
I wanted to say that the last
time I talked to you that you

38:28.973 --> 38:31.676
told me your girl
threw my [beep] away.

38:31.742 --> 38:36.414
So, I just want to say,
a check needs to be cut.

38:36.480 --> 38:37.748
A check?

38:37.815 --> 38:39.750
Most of that [beep] in
that bag I paid for.

38:39.817 --> 38:41.519
Now you want me to
cut you a check?

38:41.585 --> 38:43.521
Stop, go shopping already.

38:43.587 --> 38:44.755
Are you for real?

38:44.822 --> 38:48.292
I'm positive.

38:48.359 --> 38:49.293
I'm like, "Thanks for coming."

38:49.360 --> 38:50.728
You threw my [beep] away.

38:50.795 --> 38:53.130
Is that what was in the bag?

38:53.197 --> 38:54.598
No, this ain't got
nothing to do with your bag.

38:54.665 --> 38:55.966
Baby, baby, baby.

38:56.033 --> 38:56.901
No.

38:56.967 --> 38:58.169
Yeah, it was.

38:58.235 --> 39:02.173
Okay so wait, wait.

39:02.239 --> 39:07.078
Monistate and BV capsules,
that was in the bag?

39:07.144 --> 39:08.179
Did you leave this?

39:08.245 --> 39:10.214
Did you leave that?

39:10.281 --> 39:11.282
Bitch.

39:11.348 --> 39:12.917
Back up a taste, ho.

39:12.983 --> 39:15.853
Maybe I had the couchie cream
because my [beep] was [beep]

39:15.920 --> 39:17.388
your dirty ass.

39:17.455 --> 39:19.890
Yeast infection
cream, what about it?

39:21.158 --> 39:22.093
Bitch.

39:22.159 --> 39:23.894
Don't ever call
me like that, ho.

39:30.868 --> 39:34.538
{\an5}Hey, ho , ass, ho.

39:34.605 --> 39:35.773
{\an5}That's when you need to stop.

39:35.840 --> 39:37.308
{\an5}When you drink, you're a
completely different person.

39:37.374 --> 39:39.443
{\an5}Don't try to defend
that skunk ass bitch.

39:39.510 --> 39:43.280
{\an5}You're so whack.

39:43.347 --> 39:45.182
{\an5}You are in the house smoking
weed, you're having a party.

39:45.249 --> 39:46.684
{\an5}You got bitches downstairs.

39:46.751 --> 39:50.254
{\an5}You're saying the same
thing over and over.

39:50.321 --> 39:52.423
{\an5}Kameron came home from
his dad and he was like,

39:52.490 --> 39:55.126
{\an5}"Dad has a girlfriend and
her name is Amanda."

39:55.192 --> 39:57.128
{\an5}I'm going to be a step
mom for a little bit.

39:57.194 --> 39:59.130
{\an5}First time I heard you say that.

39:59.196 --> 40:02.767
{\an5}I wanted to rip your face
off, but I'm not going to.

40:02.833 --> 40:04.135
{\an5}I'm the mother.

40:04.201 --> 40:07.772
{\an5}I started the root of this, so
you have to understand that.

40:07.838 --> 40:09.874
{\an5}I can't control her mouth,
so you're going to tell me

40:09.940 --> 40:11.408
{\an5}what I should be
doing about that.

40:11.475 --> 40:13.511
{\an5}All I hear is I can't
wait to get to the gym.

40:13.577 --> 40:16.647
{\an5}Ooh, I want my stomach flat.

40:16.714 --> 40:21.185
{\an5}I'm usually not like this, but
there's something about you.

40:21.252 --> 40:22.853
{\an5}Did you tell her you're
still in love with me.

40:22.920 --> 40:24.822
{\an5}Everybody knows that
man belongs to me.

40:24.889 --> 40:26.791
{\an5}[beep] bitch!

40:26.857 --> 40:28.392
{\an5}You don't know [beep] about
music.

40:28.459 --> 40:31.562
{\an5}At 34-years-old you
still keep trying.

40:31.629 --> 40:34.565
{\an5}Teairra, good luck
with your career.

40:34.632 --> 40:35.332
{\an5}Don't yell.

40:35.399 --> 40:37.601
{\an5}Don't cuss me, bitch.

40:37.668 --> 40:41.405
{\an5}If that's all you feel like
you gotta do is say your sorry.

40:41.472 --> 40:48.345
{\an5}♪♪

40:48.412 --> 40:49.513
{\an5}Did I do anything to you?

40:50.915 --> 40:54.051
{\an5}[yelling]

40:54.118 --> 40:56.821
{\an5}♪♪
