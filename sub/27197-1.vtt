01:32.860 --> 01:34.040
- Hope I've done this right.

01:34.040 --> 01:34.873
- So do I.

01:35.750 --> 01:39.023
- If only I had my copy of
101 Manly Things to Know.

01:39.023 --> 01:41.112
- What do you think happened?

01:41.112 --> 01:42.224
- I don't know.

01:42.224 --> 01:43.484
Sometimes tyres just blow.

01:43.484 --> 01:44.871
- Tyres don't just blow.

01:44.871 --> 01:46.002
- Does it need a reason to blow?

01:46.002 --> 01:48.835
- Everything happens for a reason.

01:50.089 --> 01:51.686
Something must have caused it.

01:51.686 --> 01:52.702
- Says who?

01:52.702 --> 01:53.535
- Says me!

01:54.531 --> 01:56.044
- All right, God did it.

01:56.044 --> 01:56.973
Satisfied?

01:56.973 --> 01:58.197
- No.

01:58.197 --> 01:59.258
- You wanted an answer.

01:59.258 --> 02:00.532
- That's no kind of answer.

02:00.532 --> 02:02.936
- Well it keeps two billion
Christians sleeping at night.

02:02.936 --> 02:07.019
- Okay, so why did the
big man blow out our tyre?

02:09.002 --> 02:10.798
- Haven't you heard?

02:10.798 --> 02:12.298
He holds a grudge.

02:14.511 --> 02:15.896
You know, you could've helped me.

02:15.896 --> 02:18.059
- You never asked.

02:18.059 --> 02:19.892
- Well I'm askin' now.

02:21.588 --> 02:23.256
- Well I am helping.

02:23.256 --> 02:24.089
- How so?

02:24.937 --> 02:28.078
- Well, I'm your motivation.

02:28.078 --> 02:28.911
- Uh-huh.

02:38.014 --> 02:40.264
Well consider me motivated.

- What is this?

03:27.571 --> 03:29.657
- People call that music.

03:29.657 --> 03:31.407
- You're awake.

03:33.696 --> 03:38.274
- Turning the radio on
will do that to a person.

03:38.274 --> 03:39.817
How long was I out?

03:39.817 --> 03:40.734
- Not long.

03:51.320 --> 03:53.487
Someone forgot to fill up.

03:54.538 --> 03:57.458
- Well, we still might
stop and get petrol.

03:57.458 --> 03:58.766
- You sound confident.

03:58.766 --> 04:00.417
- There's always somewhere, isn't there?

04:00.417 --> 04:01.724
- Yeah, there is when
you're somewhere normal,

04:01.724 --> 04:03.012
we're in the middle of nowhere.

04:03.012 --> 04:04.969
- Oh, are you scared?

04:04.969 --> 04:06.480
- No.

04:06.480 --> 04:07.480
Just saying.

04:10.757 --> 04:14.184
- Just remember why we
came here, all right?

04:14.184 --> 04:15.434
Bit of privacy.

04:20.048 --> 04:22.948
- Do you know any car games?

04:22.948 --> 04:23.781
- Um.

04:26.207 --> 04:28.207
Well I guess the number plate game's out.

04:30.401 --> 04:32.157
- Hide and seek.

04:32.157 --> 04:33.386
- You don't have to do this.

04:33.386 --> 04:34.450
- What?

04:34.450 --> 04:36.299
- Entertain me.

04:36.299 --> 04:38.147
- I just wanted to play a game.

04:38.147 --> 04:39.621
- Sweet.

04:39.621 --> 04:41.335
- I'm a sweet man.

04:41.335 --> 04:42.720
It's why you fell in love with me.

04:42.720 --> 04:43.816
- Mm.

04:43.816 --> 04:47.233
- Well that or my huge--
- Petrol station!

05:03.244 --> 05:05.258
- How 'bout you go out and pump?

05:05.258 --> 05:06.675
- I vote I don't.

05:07.697 --> 05:09.610
- Flip you for it.

05:09.610 --> 05:10.589
- Why would I flip you for it

05:10.589 --> 05:13.001
when I know that you're
the one that's going out?

05:13.001 --> 05:14.952
- What about women's lib?

05:14.952 --> 05:16.093
- What?

05:16.093 --> 05:17.720
- I'm treatin' you as an equal.

05:17.720 --> 05:19.116
- Yeah, but we're not equals, are we?

05:19.116 --> 05:21.241
'Cause I'm clearly superior.

05:21.241 --> 05:23.648
- So then you'll do a better job than me.

05:23.648 --> 05:24.565
Out you go.

05:46.597 --> 05:48.707
I might see if he's got a toilet.

05:48.707 --> 05:52.457
- Hurry up.

05:57.475 --> 05:58.308
- Hi.

06:15.920 --> 06:17.670
Do you mind if I, um?

06:20.283 --> 06:21.116
Okay.

07:35.516 --> 07:37.433
- Number two, how much?

07:39.968 --> 07:41.803
- I'm closin' now.

07:41.803 --> 07:44.174
I'm closin' the shop.

07:44.174 --> 07:45.007
Closing!

07:46.457 --> 07:49.040
- That should cover it.

08:01.780 --> 08:02.760
- You have the keys?

08:02.760 --> 08:03.593
- Yeah.

08:07.553 --> 08:10.179
- Nice keyring.

08:10.179 --> 08:12.902
- What, I think it's cute.

08:12.902 --> 08:14.891
Shit, I left my wallet in there.

08:14.891 --> 08:16.604
- Up that with Lurch?

08:16.604 --> 08:18.271
Well that's unlucky.

08:21.576 --> 08:22.677
Fine.

08:22.677 --> 08:24.510
Go on me own, shall I?

09:14.706 --> 09:16.333
Right there on the counter.

09:16.333 --> 09:17.166
- So mean.

09:41.266 --> 09:42.528
- You're shakin'.

09:42.528 --> 09:44.077
- Yeah I know.

09:44.077 --> 09:45.823
I'm the one shaking.

09:45.823 --> 09:47.041
- You cold?

09:47.041 --> 09:49.438
- No, I think I need a cigarette.

09:49.438 --> 09:50.902
There any fags in here?

09:50.902 --> 09:53.301
- What happened to yours?

09:53.301 --> 09:55.968
- Smoked the last one, didn't I?

10:01.824 --> 10:02.824
Bingo wings.

10:04.663 --> 10:05.763
You want one?

10:05.763 --> 10:06.596
- Later.

10:07.674 --> 10:09.054
After we've had sex.

10:09.054 --> 10:10.475
- You assume.

10:10.475 --> 10:12.106
- I know.

10:12.106 --> 10:13.856
- You think you know.

10:20.201 --> 10:21.457
Fuck.

10:21.457 --> 10:22.540
- What?

10:24.268 --> 10:25.935
- What have you done with my lighter?

10:25.935 --> 10:27.231
- Don't know what you mean.

10:27.231 --> 10:29.260
- Come on, where is it?

10:29.260 --> 10:30.558
- I guess you'll just
have to strip search me

10:30.558 --> 10:32.691
when we get there.

10:35.292 --> 10:38.709
- Right, well that's that then, isn't it?

10:47.785 --> 10:50.101
How long 'til we're there?

10:50.101 --> 10:51.236
- Not long.

10:51.236 --> 10:52.946
- Well how long's not long?

10:52.946 --> 10:53.779
- Soon.

11:09.831 --> 11:10.788
It's just a motorbike.

11:10.788 --> 11:12.121
- Is it?

11:14.284 --> 11:15.242
- What's the difference between

11:15.242 --> 11:17.409
a motorcyclist and a cock?

11:18.743 --> 11:20.002
None.

11:20.002 --> 11:21.770
Both brainless pieces of
meat with helmets on top.

11:21.770 --> 11:23.078
- I think he's following us.

11:23.078 --> 11:23.911
- Who?

11:23.911 --> 11:25.719
- That creep from the petrol station.

11:25.719 --> 11:26.696
- You're being paranoid.

11:26.696 --> 11:28.807
- Yeah, but that doesn't
mean I'm not right, does it?

11:33.568 --> 11:35.651
- Trust me, it's not him.

11:49.626 --> 11:52.902
- In 300 yards, turn left.

12:00.090 --> 12:00.923
Turn left.

12:05.636 --> 12:07.141
- See?

12:07.141 --> 12:09.141
Told you it was nothing.

12:11.761 --> 12:15.844
- You have
reached your destination.

12:20.546 --> 12:21.696
- Nice house.

12:21.696 --> 12:23.799
- Lucky we got
it at the last minute.

12:23.799 --> 12:27.966
- Come on, hurry
up, I'm desperate to pee.

12:52.079 --> 12:52.912
- Shit.

12:52.912 --> 12:54.490
- What?

12:54.490 --> 12:55.852
- Wrong key.

12:57.234 --> 12:58.901
- Come on, hurry up!

13:00.034 --> 13:02.034
- After you.
- Thank you.

13:18.475 --> 13:21.528
- I'll get the bags then, shall I?

13:37.966 --> 13:41.255
Becca, wasn't there a torch in here?

14:04.261 --> 14:05.594
Honey, I'm home!

14:07.434 --> 14:08.267
Shit.

14:11.096 --> 14:11.929
Becca?

14:18.655 --> 14:19.488
Becca?

14:28.320 --> 14:29.786
If you're waitin' to do that

14:29.786 --> 14:30.619
jumpin' out on me thing,

14:30.619 --> 14:33.369
then let's just get it over with.

14:34.256 --> 14:35.923
- What're you doing?

14:37.374 --> 14:39.124
- Nothing, I was just,

14:39.124 --> 14:40.708
didn't get to do my honey I'm home thing.

14:40.708 --> 14:42.178
- Aw.

14:42.178 --> 14:44.003
You can do it now if you want.

14:44.003 --> 14:46.242
- No, it won't be the same.

14:46.242 --> 14:47.217
- Okay.

14:47.217 --> 14:49.412
I'm just running a bath, it's a bit cold.

14:49.412 --> 14:51.806
Can you be a man and put the fire on?

14:51.806 --> 14:52.889
- Okay.

15:52.700 --> 15:53.533
- Love is

15:55.550 --> 15:58.073
never having to say you're sorry.

15:58.073 --> 16:01.562
- Yeah, you're
right, that one is stupid.

16:01.562 --> 16:04.361
Um.

16:04.361 --> 16:05.194
Love is

16:09.129 --> 16:11.248
putting up with your big hairy feet.

16:14.277 --> 16:16.027
- Love is compromise.

16:17.370 --> 16:19.953
- Mm, don't you mean sacrifice?

16:23.299 --> 16:27.192
- Love is never having
to ask for a blowjob.

16:27.192 --> 16:28.025
- Mm-hm.

16:34.560 --> 16:35.393
Okay.

16:36.429 --> 16:38.679
But then don't ask for one.

17:27.701 --> 17:28.534
- Hey.

19:10.540 --> 19:11.373
Hello?

19:14.490 --> 19:15.323
Alva?

19:17.166 --> 19:19.166
No, wrong, wrong number.

19:39.430 --> 19:40.430
- Guess who?

19:42.032 --> 19:42.865
- Um.

19:43.783 --> 19:45.164
Gillian Anderson.

19:45.164 --> 19:48.302
And you've come to confess
your undying love for me.

19:48.302 --> 19:49.933
- Scully?

19:49.933 --> 19:51.381
- Yeah.

19:51.381 --> 19:52.798
- Really?

19:54.192 --> 19:55.418
- It's the red hair.

19:55.418 --> 19:56.585
- Huh.

19:59.553 --> 20:00.698
- More wine?

20:00.698 --> 20:01.782
- We have more wine?

20:01.782 --> 20:02.963
- Well the kitchen had more wine,

20:02.963 --> 20:05.195
so now we have more wine.

20:05.195 --> 20:06.028
- Oh.

20:06.028 --> 20:08.861
Well then it would be rude not to.

20:22.362 --> 20:23.195
Cheers.

20:35.168 --> 20:36.920
- You hear that?

20:36.920 --> 20:37.753
- What?

20:38.825 --> 20:39.658
- Exactly.

20:41.017 --> 20:43.782
Nothing that needs to be said.

20:43.782 --> 20:46.419
We know each other inside and out.

20:46.419 --> 20:47.252
- I think we might still have

20:47.252 --> 20:49.835
a few surprises for each other.

20:59.350 --> 21:01.745
I wish we could stay like this forever.

21:01.745 --> 21:03.745
- Forever's a long time.

21:04.877 --> 21:07.447
- I think that's kind of the point.

21:29.828 --> 21:32.114
- It's just the door.

21:43.097 --> 21:45.847
Must not have closed it properly.

21:53.623 --> 21:54.456
You okay?

21:56.111 --> 21:56.944
- Sure.

21:59.686 --> 22:01.436
- Well that means no.

22:05.655 --> 22:06.905
- When I was...

22:10.287 --> 22:12.857
I don't know, I just,

22:12.857 --> 22:17.024
just afraid that everything's
gonna catch up with us.

22:20.132 --> 22:23.882
I mean, nothing stays
perfect forever, right?

22:26.031 --> 22:26.864
- Hey.

22:27.945 --> 22:29.945
You made the right call.

22:31.288 --> 22:33.238
We needed to get away.

22:33.238 --> 22:34.738
Just hit the road.

22:36.655 --> 22:38.488
See where it takes us.

22:44.279 --> 22:45.112

Michael?

26:03.151 --> 26:05.024
- Yeah?

26:05.024 --> 26:07.107
- Have you seen my shoes?

26:08.435 --> 26:09.938
- Checked your feet?

26:09.938 --> 26:12.938
- They're gone.

26:12.938 --> 26:14.845
- What, your feet?

26:14.845 --> 26:16.955
- Come on.

26:16.955 --> 26:19.227
Only just got those shoes.

26:19.227 --> 26:20.573
- They'll be around.

26:20.573 --> 26:22.220
We'll find them tomorrow.

26:22.220 --> 26:24.657
- I think we should find them now.

26:24.657 --> 26:26.803
- Why, you going somewhere?

26:26.803 --> 26:27.886
- No.

26:28.842 --> 26:32.227
I just think we should find them now.

26:32.227 --> 26:35.310
- We'll find 'em tomorrow, I promise.

26:36.458 --> 26:38.286
Let's just get to bed for now.

26:38.286 --> 26:39.536
- Okay.

27:20.872 --> 27:21.705
- Get on your knees.

27:21.705 --> 27:22.633
- What?

27:22.633 --> 27:24.784
- Get on your knees.

27:25.920 --> 27:26.837
Stay there.

27:28.185 --> 27:29.691
My turn.

27:29.691 --> 27:31.600
Huh?

27:36.557 --> 27:38.068
Hands behind your back.

27:39.003 --> 27:39.836
- Why?

27:40.949 --> 27:43.782
- Put your hands behind your back.

28:05.354 --> 28:07.187
- Whoa, what was that?

28:08.262 --> 28:09.934
- I don't hear anything.

28:13.158 --> 28:14.335
It's just the TV.

28:14.335 --> 28:16.902
- Well yeah, who's gonna be
turning the TV on, clever dick?

28:16.902 --> 28:18.189
- Well forget about the
TV, and I'll show you

28:18.189 --> 28:20.293
how clever it can be.

28:20.293 --> 28:21.552
- No.

28:24.996 --> 28:28.957
- I'll gonna check it out then, shall I?

28:28.957 --> 28:30.948
- What, so you're just
gonna leave me like this?

28:30.948 --> 28:32.115
- Be a second.

28:34.717 --> 28:37.867
The remote just broke--

28:37.867 --> 28:38.700
- Michael?

28:40.231 --> 28:42.424
- Thank you very much.

28:42.424 --> 28:43.257
Michael!

28:48.378 --> 28:49.211
Fuck!

28:52.321 --> 28:53.154
Michael!

28:56.258 --> 28:57.091
Michael!

29:01.744 --> 29:02.577
Fuck!

29:03.701 --> 29:05.051
Michael!

29:11.132 --> 29:11.965
Michael.

29:13.023 --> 29:15.465
Michael, wake up right now.

29:15.465 --> 29:17.746
Michael, there's someone in the house.

29:22.371 --> 29:23.791
Michael.

29:23.791 --> 29:26.124
Michael, wake up, now!

29:30.545 --> 29:31.378
Michael!

29:34.667 --> 29:36.374
- What the fuck?

29:36.374 --> 29:37.922
- Untie me!

29:37.922 --> 29:38.880
- I'm bleeding.

29:38.880 --> 29:41.213
- Untie me now, bleed later!

29:44.355 --> 29:45.658
Come on, untie me.

29:45.658 --> 29:47.323
There's someone in the house.

29:47.323 --> 29:48.465
- What are you talking about?

29:48.465 --> 29:51.999
- I heard them coming up the stairs.

29:51.999 --> 29:54.032
- It's just the telly.

29:54.032 --> 29:55.533
How about a bit of sympathy for my head?

29:55.533 --> 29:56.999
- No, how about you take me seriously?

29:56.999 --> 29:58.917
I wanna get out of here, now!

29:58.917 --> 30:00.421
- And go where, Becca?

30:00.421 --> 30:01.254
- Anywhere!

30:01.254 --> 30:02.899
Anywhere but here.

30:02.899 --> 30:04.575
- Well just listen to yourself.

30:04.575 --> 30:05.494
Now you got all stressed,

30:05.494 --> 30:06.994
and you're just gettin' a bit paranoid.

30:06.994 --> 30:08.866
- No, don't patronise me, Michael.

30:08.866 --> 30:09.924
- Fine.

30:09.924 --> 30:11.416
I'm gonna check it out.

30:11.416 --> 30:13.121
- Wait, on your own?

30:13.121 --> 30:14.796
- You just said you
thought someone was here.

30:14.796 --> 30:16.056
- I know, I know, yeah, I did!

30:16.056 --> 30:19.477
- So I'm gonna go and have a look.

30:19.477 --> 30:21.342
- Wait, wait, no, wait!

30:21.342 --> 30:22.342
- It's fine.

30:23.456 --> 30:24.623
Be right back.

30:30.124 --> 30:33.493
- It's like a picture
out of a history book.

30:33.493 --> 30:37.156
I feel as though I were
in the 17th century.

30:37.156 --> 30:40.073
Michael?

30:44.511 --> 30:45.814
- Stubbed my toe.

30:45.814 --> 30:46.796
- Oh!

30:46.796 --> 30:47.629
Idiot!

30:51.714 --> 30:56.069
- What a shame they
let it get so run down.

30:56.069 --> 30:57.129
Straight on?

30:57.129 --> 31:00.291
- Yes, all the road around it.

31:00.291 --> 31:02.124
- There's no one here.

31:04.365 --> 31:07.615
Told you, the remote must've just fell.

31:44.005 --> 31:46.987
- I'm sure I
heard someone, though.

31:46.987 --> 31:48.070
- No it's uh,

31:49.020 --> 31:50.687
it's just the telly.

33:31.037 --> 33:31.870
- Michael?

33:32.981 --> 33:34.568
Michael, what are you doing?

33:34.568 --> 33:36.235
- Nothin'.

33:37.139 --> 33:38.141
- What's going on?

33:38.141 --> 33:39.606
What's taking so long?

33:39.606 --> 33:41.961
- Nothing,
let's just get to bed.

33:41.961 --> 33:44.031
- I know when you're lying.

33:44.031 --> 33:44.864
- I'm not lying.

33:44.864 --> 33:47.197
Everything's fine, honestly.

33:49.626 --> 33:50.543
- Whatever.

33:54.916 --> 33:56.988
You're lucky I'm scared.

33:56.988 --> 34:01.182
Otherwise you were sleeping
on your own tonight.

34:01.182 --> 34:04.015
- Let's just get some sleep, okay?

35:44.498 --> 35:47.659
- No, I'm still annoyed with you.

35:53.150 --> 35:57.317
You've left a tap running.

36:00.465 --> 36:03.249
I'll do it then.

36:08.951 --> 36:11.031
Michael!

36:11.031 --> 36:12.517
Michael!

36:12.517 --> 36:13.937
Michael!

36:13.937 --> 36:15.602
No!

36:15.602 --> 36:16.435
No!

36:17.427 --> 36:19.052
Michael!

38:06.492 --> 38:08.242
Who the fuck are you?

39:46.643 --> 39:49.810
- Guess who?

40:48.012 --> 40:50.595
- Oh!

41:39.482 --> 41:40.315
- Hello?

42:45.596 --> 42:46.429
- Hi!
- Hi!

42:46.429 --> 42:47.464
- Thanks so much for stopping!

42:47.464 --> 42:49.204
- That's not a problem.

42:49.204 --> 42:50.834
- Hi, um, do you
mind if I sit in the front?

42:50.834 --> 42:51.811
It's just I get carsick.

42:51.811 --> 42:52.769
- Yeah, that's fine.

42:52.769 --> 42:53.676
Um, he doesn't speak English.

42:53.676 --> 42:54.654
- Oh, sorry!

42:56.761 --> 42:57.683
- Thank you.

42:57.683 --> 42:59.933
I'll just get rid of these.

43:10.400 --> 43:11.498
Thank you.

43:11.498 --> 43:13.331
- Yeah, sure!

43:15.281 --> 43:16.663
- Thank you so much for picking us up.

43:16.663 --> 43:18.627
You have no idea the
difference you've made.

43:18.627 --> 43:20.246
- Aw, I'm happy to help.

43:20.246 --> 43:21.587
- It's a big, big help.

43:21.587 --> 43:23.455
- You might've seen our car a while back.

43:23.455 --> 43:25.485
- Yeah, we did see a car.

43:27.765 --> 43:28.802
Did you break down?

43:28.802 --> 43:30.589
- It proved unreliable.

43:30.589 --> 43:31.643
- A rental?

43:31.643 --> 43:32.726
- I borrowed.

43:34.815 --> 43:36.926
- So, what are your names?

43:36.926 --> 43:37.984
I'm Alva.

43:37.984 --> 43:39.332
- Alva?

43:39.332 --> 43:40.422
That's pretty.

43:40.422 --> 43:42.492
- Brit's always have such boring names.

43:42.492 --> 43:44.364
- I'm sure your names aren't dull.

43:44.364 --> 43:46.725
If we all know each other,
we can be friends, right?

43:46.725 --> 43:47.944
- Simple as that, is it?

43:47.944 --> 43:49.244
- Yeah, of course.

43:49.244 --> 43:50.748
- Know the name, know the person.

43:50.748 --> 43:53.636
- Well you can tell a
lot from a person's name.

43:53.636 --> 43:55.905
Do you know what Alva means?

43:55.905 --> 43:56.905
- Beautiful.

43:58.057 --> 43:59.923
- It means elf.

43:59.923 --> 44:01.427
- Ha, it's fitting.

44:02.359 --> 44:03.862
- Michael, stop teasing.

44:03.862 --> 44:05.653
- Oh, Michael.

44:05.653 --> 44:07.037
That is a nice name.

44:07.037 --> 44:09.069
It's not boring.

44:09.069 --> 44:10.815
- So what does Michael mean?

44:10.815 --> 44:12.077
- I have no idea.

44:13.175 --> 44:14.175
- I'm Becca.

44:15.329 --> 44:16.629
- So now you think you know us?

44:16.629 --> 44:17.687
- Yeah.

44:17.687 --> 44:19.560
- And now we're all friends.

44:19.560 --> 44:20.452
- This is Freyr.

44:20.452 --> 44:21.285
- Oh.

44:24.299 --> 44:26.248
- So what's your story?

44:26.248 --> 44:27.170
- My story?

44:27.170 --> 44:28.471
- Yeah.

44:28.471 --> 44:30.547
You and Freyr here.

44:30.547 --> 44:31.929
Since we're all sharing.

44:31.929 --> 44:34.818
- Oh, well, I spend half my time here

44:34.818 --> 44:37.825
and half my time in a
small village in Sweden.

44:37.825 --> 44:39.888
That's why I speak the language somewhat,

44:39.888 --> 44:41.905
but I butcher the accent.

44:41.905 --> 44:44.384
Uh, Freyr and I met at school in Sweden.

44:44.384 --> 44:45.525
- Oh.

44:45.525 --> 44:46.705
School sweethearts?

44:46.705 --> 44:48.476
- Yeah, you could say that.

44:48.476 --> 44:49.854
- She did say that.

44:49.854 --> 44:51.845
- I think it's a sweet story.

44:51.845 --> 44:55.150
- We were each other's first kiss.

44:55.150 --> 44:56.400
- How romantic.

44:58.398 --> 45:00.150
- So are you from near here?

45:00.150 --> 45:01.086
- No.

45:01.086 --> 45:02.940
- Oh, are you on holiday?

45:02.940 --> 45:04.687
- Uh, more of a getaway.

45:04.687 --> 45:05.520
- Oh.

45:08.343 --> 45:10.384
Well you know all about us two.

45:10.384 --> 45:12.256
What about you?

45:12.256 --> 45:14.047
- What do you wanna know?

45:14.047 --> 45:17.048
- Anything, doesn't matter.

45:17.048 --> 45:21.215
- Well if it doesn't matter,
then why do you wanna know?

45:25.761 --> 45:26.594
So, Freyr.

45:27.551 --> 45:28.690
How you guys going, then?

45:28.690 --> 45:30.111
- He doesn't speak English.

45:30.111 --> 45:31.778
- Oh, just checkin'.

45:33.525 --> 45:35.030
So where are you guys going?

45:35.030 --> 45:35.863
- Home.

45:36.985 --> 45:38.845
Where do you two want dropping off?

45:38.845 --> 45:40.228
- We'll let you know.

45:40.228 --> 45:41.649
- Do you have a place to stay?

45:41.649 --> 45:43.233
- We'll find somewhere.

45:43.233 --> 45:45.059
- There's nowhere around here.

45:45.059 --> 45:47.336
- Ah, we'll find somewhere.

45:47.336 --> 45:50.058
- Are you guys lost or something?

45:50.058 --> 45:51.196
- Something.

45:51.196 --> 45:53.836
- Yeah, I mean do you know where you are?

45:53.836 --> 45:55.253
- We're with you.

45:56.888 --> 45:58.435
- Okay, well, just let me know

45:58.435 --> 46:01.768
where you want me to drop you off, yeah?

46:21.887 --> 46:26.054
Yeah, just let me know where
you want me to drop you off.

46:30.391 --> 46:31.308
- Nice car.

46:32.676 --> 46:34.378
- Thank you.

46:34.378 --> 46:35.378
- Thank you.

46:45.498 --> 46:47.241
What did that say?

46:47.241 --> 46:49.641
- We're almost home.

46:49.641 --> 46:51.426
- Oh, well, you'll be wanting
to get rid of us, then.

46:52.439 --> 46:55.132
- What's it like living out here?

46:55.132 --> 46:58.018
No one around to disturb you?

46:58.018 --> 46:59.237
- Yeah, they don't.

46:59.237 --> 47:02.159
- Alva, do you love Freyr?

47:02.159 --> 47:04.236
- Yeah, why do you ask?

47:04.236 --> 47:05.069
- And

47:05.987 --> 47:07.404
does he love you?

47:09.891 --> 47:11.349
- I, I think I'm just gonna

47:11.349 --> 47:12.756
drop you both here if that's okay.

47:12.756 --> 47:13.744
- You stop this car and I'll put your head

47:13.744 --> 47:15.854
through the windscreen.

47:15.854 --> 47:17.000
See how much he loves you with holes

47:17.000 --> 47:19.250
where your eyes used to be.

47:22.277 --> 47:25.444
Really doesn't speak English, does he?

47:26.563 --> 47:27.896
- No.

47:27.896 --> 47:29.410
- Wait, you can't answer me?

47:29.410 --> 47:32.992
- No, no, he doesn't speak English.

47:32.992 --> 47:34.621
- Great.

47:34.621 --> 47:36.329
Great, well then we can just

47:36.329 --> 47:39.284
keep pretending like
everything all well and good.

47:39.284 --> 47:41.201
You know, like friends.

47:42.183 --> 47:44.508
Alva, but do you trust us?

47:44.508 --> 47:46.292
- You can be honest.

47:46.292 --> 47:48.489
- No, I, I don't trust you.

47:48.489 --> 47:52.108
- So you can trust us
not to be trustworthy.

47:52.108 --> 47:54.783
- And if you don't know
what we're likely to do,

47:54.783 --> 47:58.313
then you're likely to do what we say.

48:00.798 --> 48:02.429
- What'd he say?

48:02.429 --> 48:04.679
- Um, he asked if I'm okay.

48:05.846 --> 48:07.561
- I thought you said he
didn't understand English.

48:07.561 --> 48:08.979
- Well he's Swedish, he's not stupid,

48:08.979 --> 48:10.555
he knows when something's not right.

48:10.555 --> 48:12.972
- So make it right.

48:21.453 --> 48:22.468
- What did you tell him?

48:22.468 --> 48:23.324
- I just said that you're mad

48:23.324 --> 48:25.759
at each other for getting lost.

48:25.759 --> 48:27.092
- That was good.

48:31.042 --> 48:32.303
- What do you want from us?

48:32.303 --> 48:33.198
- We don't want anything from you,

48:33.198 --> 48:34.387
we just want your car.

48:34.387 --> 48:35.220
But then

48:36.627 --> 48:38.333
what do you suggest we do with you?

48:38.333 --> 48:40.200
- Well just, just take
the car and leave us here.

48:41.787 --> 48:44.120
- We're English, not stupid.

48:47.272 --> 48:49.791
Just keep driving for now.

49:06.727 --> 49:07.810
Pull in here.

49:25.184 --> 49:27.142
Turn the engine off,

49:27.142 --> 49:30.768
and take the keys out of the ignition.

49:30.768 --> 49:31.851
Go look at me

49:33.434 --> 49:34.267
and smile.

49:39.940 --> 49:41.857
Thank you for the lift.

49:43.507 --> 49:44.840
You ready, baby?

49:45.791 --> 49:46.624
- Yeah.

49:58.333 --> 49:59.238
- Please, please!

49:59.238 --> 50:00.497
- Alva!

50:00.497 --> 50:01.878
Please, please just take the car,

50:01.878 --> 50:03.961
please just take the car!

50:06.832 --> 50:08.734
Why are you doing this to us?

50:08.734 --> 50:10.401
- There's no reason.

50:11.697 --> 50:13.447
It's just fun, innit?

50:18.039 --> 50:21.727
No, please!

50:29.352 --> 50:30.602
- No you don't!

50:36.840 --> 50:38.963
- That's great work, baby.

50:38.963 --> 50:39.796
Hey?

52:37.107 --> 52:39.940
- I never really liked blond guys.

52:43.404 --> 52:44.237
Alva tuh,

52:48.491 --> 52:51.542
Alva tuh, I'm not even
gonna bother saying that,

52:51.542 --> 52:53.373
but she was 27.

52:53.373 --> 52:55.123
I thought she was 12.

52:58.376 --> 52:59.209
Oh my god!

53:00.335 --> 53:02.658
They were only one stamp
off a whole chicken.

53:03.718 --> 53:04.551
Shame.

53:16.901 --> 53:20.151
I think they look better on me, anyway.

53:21.295 --> 53:22.678
What do you think?

53:22.678 --> 53:23.678
- Very nice.

53:25.156 --> 53:28.047
- You're not even looking!

53:28.047 --> 53:30.464
- Well give us a twirl, then.

53:32.318 --> 53:33.764
Yeah.

53:33.764 --> 53:34.597
Very you.

53:35.803 --> 53:37.147
You ready?

53:37.147 --> 53:38.612
- We have to go right now?

53:38.612 --> 53:40.684
Come on, it's a nice night.

53:40.684 --> 53:42.434
Let's stay for a bit.

53:48.296 --> 53:52.073
Do you remember when you got me this?

53:52.073 --> 53:52.990
- I forget.

53:56.626 --> 53:58.209
- She was my first.

54:00.536 --> 54:01.619
And you said,

54:02.485 --> 54:05.402
"Beautiful things belong together."

54:06.270 --> 54:07.289
- I said that?

54:07.289 --> 54:10.039
- Yeah.

54:11.111 --> 54:12.786
And then you cut it off her neck

54:12.786 --> 54:14.619
and you gave it to me.

54:15.514 --> 54:17.872
- Well don't say I
never give you anything.

54:34.990 --> 54:36.407
Oh, I'm starving!

54:39.616 --> 54:42.616
I wonder if they've got any food in.

55:01.114 --> 55:04.527
- Can you watch, please?

55:04.527 --> 55:06.028
- It's not my thing.

55:06.028 --> 55:07.365
- I don't mean that!

55:07.365 --> 55:08.698
Keep a look out!

55:09.935 --> 55:11.882
Scary out here.

55:11.882 --> 55:13.019
- There's no one around.

55:13.019 --> 55:14.526
- We're around!

55:35.570 --> 55:36.403
We set?

55:37.278 --> 55:38.604
- Once I set this thing to English

55:38.604 --> 55:42.057
and find out where
we're going, we are set.

55:42.057 --> 55:43.564
- In 400 feet,

55:43.564 --> 55:45.981
- There we go.
- continue straight.

56:24.519 --> 56:25.852
- Fuck, Michael!

56:30.352 --> 56:31.519
What was that?

56:36.136 --> 56:37.094
- If only I had my copy

56:37.094 --> 56:39.427
of 101 Manly Things to Know.

56:40.622 --> 56:42.776
- What do you think happened?

56:42.776 --> 56:43.752
- I don't know.

56:43.752 --> 56:45.660
Sometimes tyres just blow.

57:16.474 --> 57:18.477

57:18.477 --> 57:21.730
♪ Lies to believe ♪
- What is this?

57:46.871 --> 57:48.137
- Now
the search for the pair

57:48.137 --> 57:51.752
may well constitute the biggest
manhunt in recent years.

57:51.752 --> 57:53.499
British law enforcement agencies

57:53.499 --> 57:55.004
are working together across the country

57:55.004 --> 57:58.667
to bring Michael Duncan and
Rebecca Wallace to justice.

57:58.667 --> 58:00.703
Duncan was last seen wearing a grey hoodie

58:00.703 --> 58:03.572
and tan leather jacket,
holding a black bag.

58:03.572 --> 58:05.571
Any member of the public sights the pair,

58:05.571 --> 58:08.958
it's advised to contact
the police immediately.

58:08.958 --> 58:10.907
Suspects are considered very high risk,

58:10.907 --> 58:13.548
and pose an extreme and immediate threat

58:13.548 --> 58:15.310
to the general public.

58:15.310 --> 58:16.811
Now for the weather, the morning looks set

58:16.811 --> 58:18.277
to be cloudy with scattered showers

58:18.277 --> 58:20.022
to the south and east of the region,

58:20.022 --> 58:21.972
brightening up towards the
latter part of the day.

58:21.972 --> 58:23.685
If you're heading to
the festival of lights--

58:31.769 --> 58:33.880
- How you doing?

58:33.880 --> 58:35.713
Do you mind if I just?

58:38.963 --> 58:39.796
Okay.

59:22.578 --> 59:24.495
- Number two, how much?

59:25.391 --> 59:26.486
Number two?

59:26.486 --> 59:27.784
- We're closing now.

59:27.784 --> 59:29.534
I'm closing the shop.

59:33.834 --> 59:36.879
- That should cover it.

59:46.805 --> 59:48.886
- Shit, I left my wallet in there!

59:48.886 --> 59:50.515
- Up that with Lurch?

59:50.515 --> 59:52.182
Well that's unlucky.

01:01:09.603 --> 01:01:10.603
- No!

01:02:20.326 --> 01:02:23.159
- I'll get the bags then, shall I?

01:02:38.357 --> 01:02:41.357
Becca, wasn't there a torch in here?

01:02:52.013 --> 01:02:53.346
Honey, I'm home!

01:02:55.151 --> 01:02:55.984
Shit.

01:03:07.990 --> 01:03:08.823
Becca?

01:03:16.572 --> 01:03:18.609
- What're you doing?

01:03:18.609 --> 01:03:20.109
- Nothing, just,

01:03:20.109 --> 01:03:23.048
didn't get to do my honey I'm home thing.

01:06:47.111 --> 01:06:47.944
- Hello?

01:06:51.465 --> 01:06:52.298
Alva?

01:06:53.749 --> 01:06:55.093
No.

01:06:55.093 --> 01:06:56.926
It's the wrong number.

01:07:01.034 --> 01:07:04.286
- I wish we could
stay like this forever.

01:07:04.286 --> 01:07:07.469
- Well forever's a long time.

01:07:07.469 --> 01:07:11.219
- I think
that's kind of the point.

01:07:32.286 --> 01:07:34.638
- It's just the door.

01:08:22.274 --> 01:08:25.774
- Have you seen my shoes?

01:08:25.774 --> 01:08:27.203
- Checked your feet?

01:08:28.225 --> 01:08:30.219
- They're gone.

01:08:30.219 --> 01:08:32.096
- What, your feet?

01:08:32.096 --> 01:08:34.170
- Come on.

01:08:34.170 --> 01:08:36.434
Only just got those shoes.

01:08:36.434 --> 01:08:37.774
- They'll be around.

01:08:37.774 --> 01:08:39.442
We'll find them tomorrow.

01:08:39.442 --> 01:08:41.965
- I think we
should find them now.

01:08:41.965 --> 01:08:44.084
- Why, you going somewhere?

01:08:44.084 --> 01:08:46.118
- No.

01:08:46.118 --> 01:08:49.453
I just think we should find them now.

01:08:49.453 --> 01:08:52.621
- We'll find them tomorrow, I promise.

01:08:53.720 --> 01:08:55.548
Let's just get to bed for now.

01:08:55.548 --> 01:08:56.965
- Okay.

01:11:17.752 --> 01:11:18.800
- Michael!

01:12:35.458 --> 01:12:37.208
Who the fuck are you?

01:13:25.368 --> 01:13:26.710
- Guess who?

01:14:47.432 --> 01:14:49.265
