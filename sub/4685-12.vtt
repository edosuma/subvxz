00:05.339 --> 00:06.591
Hey, Darla, it's Jessie!

00:06.716 --> 00:08.740
Thank you so much

00:08.741 --> 00:10.762
for sending me

00:06.716 --> 00:10.762
that video of you

00:10.887 --> 00:13.138
- cruising around Europe
- with your rich new boyfriend.

00:13.264 --> 00:14.724
(CHUCKLES)

00:14.849 --> 00:16.529
- If you consider a guy
- in his 60s "new."

00:18.310 --> 00:19.750
- Don't get bitter.
- Keep it upbeat.

00:22.607 --> 00:23.671
So I thought I'd

00:23.672 --> 00:24.734
make a video for you

00:24.859 --> 00:26.048
about how awesome

00:26.049 --> 00:27.236
my life is here

00:24.859 --> 00:27.236
in the Big Apple.

00:28.195 --> 00:29.488
Look who it is. Bertram.

00:29.614 --> 00:30.990
He's our butler.

00:30.991 --> 00:32.366
He caters to

00:29.614 --> 00:32.366
our every whim.

00:32.491 --> 00:34.827
Bertram, say hi to Darla.

00:34.953 --> 00:35.953
Go away.

00:39.498 --> 00:40.854
New Yorkers may seem

00:40.855 --> 00:42.209
a little bit crusty,

00:42.334 --> 00:43.566

00:43.567 --> 00:44.796
they can be the sweetest

00:42.334 --> 00:44.796
people in the world.

00:44.921 --> 00:46.547

00:49.802 --> 00:51.218

00:51.343 --> 00:52.845
(SCOFFS) Please!

00:52.971 --> 00:55.371
- My kids wouldn't go - near that rat with
- Hair extensions!

00:55.598 --> 00:57.976
I wouldn't bet on that.

01:11.572 --> 01:13.867
Excuse me!

01:13.868 --> 01:16.160

01:11.572 --> 01:16.160
and over-dressed.

01:19.831 --> 01:20.832
Are you all right?

05:46.265 --> 05:47.932
a tiara falling from

05:44.595 --> 05:47.932
our terrace a moment ago?

05:48.057 --> 05:49.246
Oh, I'm not sure.

05:49.247 --> 05:50.434
Could you describe it?

05:50.517 --> 05:52.811
Oh, come on now.

05:52.937 --> 05:54.855
- How many crowns
- fell in your tub?

It's diamond, sparkly,

05:59.236 --> 06:00.903
my boss got married under it.

- Is this it?
- Yes!

- Now I'm about to lose
- my job and my lunch.

a secret admirer

06:37.815 --> 06:40.859
in the building.

06:40.985 --> 06:42.236
Really?

- Is it that - saucy little dancer
- On the 12th floor?

- You're both old,
- you're both cranky,

07:06.510 --> 07:09.888
You both need a shave.

07:10.014 --> 07:12.174
- I'm surprised you - haven't put a ring
- On that yet.

07:16.770 --> 07:18.189
Why are you trying

07:18.190 --> 07:19.606
to fix me up with

07:16.770 --> 07:19.606
that old harpy?

07:19.731 --> 07:21.421
Okay, I dropped

07:21.422 --> 07:23.110
Christina's diamond tiara

07:19.731 --> 07:23.110
off the balcony,

07:23.235 --> 07:24.879
- it fell in
- Mrs. Chesterfield's hot tub,

07:24.903 --> 07:26.256
- And I need you - to get her out
- Of her apartment

07:26.280 --> 07:27.924
- So I can go retrieve it,
- so I don't get fired.

07:32.203 --> 07:33.620
- Then you've
- left us no choice.

07:33.745 --> 07:35.539
- It's time to move on
- to Plan B.

Ow!

07:40.419 --> 07:43.214

07:43.339 --> 07:44.612
Sorry, I just

07:44.613 --> 07:45.883
really love Plan C.

07:48.802 --> 07:50.263
Plan B is to tell Christina

07:50.264 --> 07:51.722
that you left the tiara out

07:51.847 --> 07:53.765
- when it came back
- from the jewelers

07:53.891 --> 07:54.766
- Instead of putting
- it in the safe

07:53.891 --> 07:54.891
Where it belongs.

07:57.936 --> 07:59.126
Because the safe is

07:59.127 --> 08:00.314
all the way upstairs.

07:57.936 --> 08:00.314
It's...

08:00.564 --> 08:03.442
It's too far.

08:39.852 --> 08:41.164
- I was wondering
- if you'd like to...

08:41.188 --> 08:44.316
Yes!

08:44.442 --> 08:46.253
- But, you don't even know
- what I was going to say!

thought he would.

09:01.917 --> 09:03.336
Hey, guys. I've got

09:03.337 --> 09:04.753
the perfect thing

09:06.880 --> 09:07.924
Let me guess.

09:07.925 --> 09:08.966
A cute outfit!

09:10.468 --> 09:12.970
No. A cute costume.

09:13.762 --> 09:14.972
Captain Kipling

09:14.973 --> 09:16.181
to the rescue!

09:16.307 --> 09:19.268
I love it!

09:19.393 --> 09:20.852
- Can we even get him
- into that?

09:20.978 --> 09:22.521
- Try keeping him
- out of it.

09:26.525 --> 09:27.692
That was not so hard.

09:30.946 --> 09:32.114
Yeah, we still have

09:32.115 --> 09:33.282
most of our fingers.

09:34.408 --> 09:36.035
It's worth it.

09:36.036 --> 09:37.661
He looks totes adorable.

09:37.744 --> 09:39.455
Okay, so,

09:39.663 --> 09:40.998
let's go throw him

09:40.999 --> 09:42.333
off the stairway and

09:39.663 --> 09:42.333
pretend that he's flying.

09:42.458 --> 09:43.981
I hope you are

09:43.982 --> 09:45.503
planning on having

09:42.458 --> 09:45.503
a stunt lizard.

09:45.669 --> 09:47.025
Oh, relax!

09:47.026 --> 09:48.380
When we throw him,

09:45.669 --> 09:48.380
we'll aim for the couch.

09:48.506 --> 09:50.507
- You cannot even - aim correctly
- For the toilet!

09:53.177 --> 09:54.261
True.

09:55.513 --> 09:56.701
So you're clear

09:56.702 --> 09:57.889
on the plan?

09:58.015 --> 09:59.117
- Yes! I get the crone
- out of her apartment

09:59.141 --> 10:00.226
And I leave the door

10:00.227 --> 10:01.310
open a crack.

10:01.435 --> 10:02.996
- It's not exactly
- Mission Impossible.

10:04.604 --> 10:05.999
- Where are you
- taking her for dinner?

10:06.023 --> 10:08.692
I'm hoping Australia.

10:08.817 --> 10:10.174
You expect me to spend money

10:10.175 --> 10:11.529
on her, too? Uh-uh-uh.

10:11.653 --> 10:13.010
We'll be dining on

10:13.011 --> 10:14.365
leftovers upstairs.

10:14.490 --> 10:16.092
- And then I'm gonna
- make her do the dishes,

10:16.116 --> 10:17.222
While I hit my head

10:17.223 --> 10:18.327
until the memory's gone.

10:19.619 --> 10:20.619
Now, scram!

10:25.417 --> 10:27.252
(CLEARS THROAT)

10:31.298 --> 10:33.467
I'm ready.

10:33.592 --> 10:34.656
Okay, let's

10:34.657 --> 10:35.719
get her done.

10:39.014 --> 10:40.724
You romantic devil.

10:52.903 --> 10:53.925
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

10:53.926 --> 10:54.946
No, no, no, no, no.

10:56.656 --> 10:58.325
- Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho!
- That was close.

(CHUCKLES)

11:02.329 --> 11:04.331
Uh-oh.

11:04.332 --> 11:06.333
This mission just got

11:02.329 --> 11:06.333
a little more impossible.

11:07.876 --> 11:09.316
I don't suppose you

11:09.317 --> 11:10.754
could chew your way

11:07.876 --> 11:10.754
through the door.

11:10.879 --> 11:12.297

- Who am I kidding.

11:12.423 --> 11:14.664
- If you could, - you would've done it
- A long time ago.

11:18.929 --> 11:20.535
Oh, Bertram,

11:20.536 --> 11:22.140
these appetizers

11:18.929 --> 11:22.140
are simply divine.

11:22.266 --> 11:23.767
- What did you say
- they were called?

11:24.643 --> 11:25.769
Potato chips?

11:26.604 --> 11:27.354
Mmm.

11:27.479 --> 11:30.566
Delightfully crunchy!

11:30.774 --> 11:32.547
And I just can't get over

11:32.548 --> 11:34.319
this breathtaking view.

11:43.787 --> 11:45.393
They must be

11:45.394 --> 11:46.998
having dinner

11:43.787 --> 11:46.998
in the kitchen.

11:47.124 --> 11:48.313
Okay, we use

11:48.314 --> 11:49.501
this rope ladder

11:47.124 --> 11:49.501
from the helicopter

11:49.627 --> 11:51.378

- Chesterfield's terrace.

11:51.503 --> 11:52.504
What do you mean "we"?

11:52.630 --> 11:54.215
I'm afraid of heights.

11:54.216 --> 11:55.799
And dying.

11:58.218 --> 12:00.137

- Steady for me.

(GASPS)

12:06.685 --> 12:07.685
Bertie, what's wrong?

12:08.604 --> 12:10.522
Nothing. I just want to

12:11.940 --> 12:13.609
- show you something
- in the kitchen.

12:19.698 --> 12:20.031
- What did you
- want to show me?

12:20.157 --> 12:22.409

Hey, Luke!

- He says,
- "To make a hit movie,

- get Johnny Depp,

to the lizard and

is also going to be

- he must be
- paid double.

- on my fingers!

That video of Kipling

17:04.713 --> 17:06.526
licking Chesterfield

17:02.898 --> 17:06.526
was hilarious.

17:06.651 --> 17:07.924
Too bad it was

17:07.925 --> 17:09.194
completely out of focus.

17:09.319 --> 17:10.948
Kipling really blew it.

17:11.114 --> 17:13.951
He is a lizard,

17:13.952 --> 17:16.787
not J.J. Abrams!

out here?

Who cares?

17:21.708 --> 17:23.102
- Let's dress Mr. Kipling
- as a pirate

17:23.126 --> 17:24.336
And have him pretend

17:24.337 --> 17:25.545
to climb it.

17:25.670 --> 17:26.838
Great idea!

17:26.964 --> 17:28.486
We'll need an eye patch,

a peg leg, and a hook.

17:32.677 --> 17:35.472
get him into the costume.

17:37.557 --> 17:38.871
Come closer.

17:38.872 --> 17:40.184
I don't bite.

- I do.
- When I feel threatened.

17:44.648 --> 17:46.316

17:46.441 --> 17:48.210

- In the armoire?

17:48.234 --> 17:49.945
No!

Want a taste?

18:15.178 --> 18:15.762
The rope ladder's gone!

18:15.887 --> 18:18.849
I bet Luke took it.

18:18.974 --> 18:20.660
- He's had dirty socks - on his floor
- For three months,

18:20.684 --> 18:21.852
But this he picks up!

MRS. CHESTERFIELD:

18:25.398 --> 18:27.190
Come, Bertie!

18:23.603 --> 18:27.190

18:45.083 --> 18:49.880

Let's jump in.

18:56.344 --> 18:58.424
- It's time to play - a little game
- I like to call,

19:00.057 --> 19:02.100
Rub-a-dub Rhoda.

19:02.225 --> 19:03.601
- Can't we just
- play checkers?

19:12.610 --> 19:13.971
- Last one in
- gets the wonky jet.

19:20.118 --> 19:21.452
(SCREAMS)

19:24.497 --> 19:26.041
Nessie!

19:26.042 --> 19:27.584
What are you

19:24.497 --> 19:27.584
doing here?

19:27.709 --> 19:28.773
Wait, this isn't

19:28.774 --> 19:29.836
our terrace?

19:29.961 --> 19:31.109
I must be

19:31.110 --> 19:32.255
sleep soaking.

19:32.589 --> 19:34.132
And I must be

19:34.133 --> 19:35.675
going now!

19:37.094 --> 19:38.825
Those revolting children

19:38.826 --> 19:40.555
were in my house?

19:40.680 --> 19:42.348
- How repugnant.
- BERTRAM: Hey!

19:42.473 --> 19:44.268
No one calls those kids

19:44.269 --> 19:46.061
revolting and repugnant

19:42.473 --> 19:46.061
except me.

19:46.269 --> 19:47.958
And they wouldn't be here

19:47.959 --> 19:49.647
if you'd given that tiara

19:46.269 --> 19:49.647
back in the first place.

19:49.773 --> 19:51.000
- And I wouldn't
- be here, either!

19:51.024 --> 19:52.671
You mean this was

19:52.672 --> 19:54.318
all a set-up?

19:54.444 --> 19:56.029
- I've never been
- so humiliated.

19:56.154 --> 19:57.822
- I find that
- hard to believe.

19:59.783 --> 20:00.805
I'm sorry,

20:00.806 --> 20:01.826
Mrs. Chesterfield.

20:01.952 --> 20:03.099
We didn't mean

20:03.100 --> 20:04.245
to hurt you.

20:01.952 --> 20:04.245
I just...

20:04.370 --> 20:05.872
- I don't want
- to lose my job.

20:05.997 --> 20:07.249
I love these kids

20:07.250 --> 20:08.499
so much.

20:08.625 --> 20:11.169
We love you, too.

20:11.294 --> 20:12.837
- I don't like
- any of you.

20:13.463 --> 20:16.340
Clearly.

20:16.466 --> 20:17.676
I'd be weeping now

20:17.677 --> 20:18.885
if my tear ducts

20:16.466 --> 20:18.885
weren't so full of Botox.

20:20.553 --> 20:21.638
Look, Rhoda,

20:21.763 --> 20:22.869
if you don't

20:22.870 --> 20:23.974
rat on Jessie,

20:24.099 --> 20:26.017
- I'll take you out
- on a real date.

20:26.143 --> 20:27.457
Why should I

20:27.458 --> 20:28.770
go out with you

20:28.895 --> 20:29.980
after the shabby way

20:29.981 --> 20:31.064
you've treated me?

20:31.189 --> 20:32.315
Suit yourself.

20:32.440 --> 20:33.650
Ooh! I love when

20:33.651 --> 20:34.859
you play hard to get.

20:36.903 --> 20:38.364
Shall we say Chez Fancy

20:38.365 --> 20:39.823
tomorrow night, 8:00?

20:39.948 --> 20:41.825
You can say it.

20:41.950 --> 20:44.510
- I'll be at the Korean - Barbecue truck on
- The corner at 4:30.

20:44.744 --> 20:45.744
Done!

20:50.416 --> 20:51.584
Score!

20:53.962 --> 20:55.254
Thank you, Bertram.

20:55.379 --> 20:57.132
- Talk about taking one
- for the team.

20:57.256 --> 20:58.424
I took more than one!

20:58.549 --> 20:59.968
That dog was

20:59.969 --> 21:01.385
all over me, too.

21:01.511 --> 21:02.930
Now go put that tiara

21:02.931 --> 21:04.347
back in the safe.

21:04.388 --> 21:05.515
I'd do it, but...

21:05.640 --> 21:06.892
We know.

21:06.893 --> 21:08.143
It's too far.

21:11.479 --> 21:12.669
RAVI: Mr. Kipling looks

21:12.670 --> 21:13.857
quite the swashbuckler,

21:11.479 --> 21:13.857
does he not?

21:15.525 --> 21:16.818
This stinks.

21:16.943 --> 21:18.984
- I told you - we should have
- Moved the furniture.

21:20.446 --> 21:22.032
I give up.

21:22.157 --> 21:23.200
Making a funny viral video

21:23.201 --> 21:24.242
is impossible

21:22.157 --> 21:24.242
if you don't have

21:24.367 --> 21:26.119
a talking dog,

21:26.120 --> 21:27.871
or a sneezing panda.

21:27.996 --> 21:29.477
Hi, guys! You want to see

21:29.478 --> 21:30.957
the video I just posted?

21:33.751 --> 21:35.566
No! No! No! No!

21:35.567 --> 21:37.380
Bad! The tiara!

21:33.751 --> 21:37.380
Gone! Fell!

21:37.421 --> 21:39.340
It fell! It's gone!

21:39.341 --> 21:41.259
It's gone!

21:37.421 --> 21:41.259
Really, really bad!

21:41.384 --> 21:42.448
Cut! Cut!

21:42.449 --> 21:43.511
Turn it off!

21:41.384 --> 21:43.511
Cut! Cut!

21:43.636 --> 21:44.179
Cut! Cut!

21:44.387 --> 21:47.640
(ALL LAUGHING)

21:47.765 --> 21:49.535
- Please don't tell me - you put this
- On the Internet.

21:49.559 --> 21:51.769
Yep! You're a star!

21:51.895 --> 21:52.980
You already got

21:52.981 --> 21:54.064
40,000 hits!

21:54.189 --> 21:55.962
You're gonna be more popular

21:55.963 --> 21:57.734
than that monkey who sniffed

21:54.189 --> 21:57.734
his own butt!

21:59.861 --> 22:01.634
Great!

22:01.635 --> 22:03.406
Now thousands of people

21:59.861 --> 22:03.406
think I'm a klutz,

22:03.531 --> 22:05.179
who lives in a penthouse

22:05.180 --> 22:06.826
and has an awesome priceless

22:03.531 --> 22:06.826
jewelry collection?

22:06.951 --> 22:08.036
(GASPS) I'm sending a link

22:08.037 --> 22:09.120
to Darla back home.

22:09.246 --> 22:10.831
That should have

22:10.832 --> 22:12.415
been Mr. Kipling.

22:12.456 --> 22:14.146
I guess he is just another

22:14.147 --> 22:15.835
pretty face with no talent.

22:15.960 --> 22:17.212
