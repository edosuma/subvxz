01:41.367 --> 01:43.169
We're serious, you
girls pick the restaurant

01:43.203 --> 01:45.138
and Balki and I will
take you to dinner.

01:45.171 --> 01:47.774
‐ Money is no object.
‐ You heard that right.

01:47.808 --> 01:51.477
When Larry and Balki go first
class, they eat the whole hog.

01:53.680 --> 01:55.716
You guys must be pretty
sure that Mr. Twinkacetti's

01:55.749 --> 01:56.883
going to give you a raise.

01:56.917 --> 01:58.785
Oh, he'll give us a raise.

01:58.819 --> 02:01.855
Cousin Larry put it
in very uncertain terms.

02:04.891 --> 02:07.661
Mm‐hmm, after the little
talk I had with him yesterday

02:07.694 --> 02:09.495
it's in the bag.

02:09.530 --> 02:14.267
[chuckles]
I was good. No.
No, I was great.

02:14.300 --> 02:16.837
I told him that when he
walked through that door today

02:16.870 --> 02:19.372
I wanted an answer and it
had better be the right one.

02:21.307 --> 02:22.509
Good morning, Mr. Twinkacetti.

02:22.543 --> 02:24.344
[exhales loudly]
Yeah, yeah.

02:27.247 --> 02:28.214
Mr. Twinkacetti?

02:30.283 --> 02:33.453
Isn't there...something
you want to tell us?

02:34.621 --> 02:36.356
Yeah, get to work.

02:41.494 --> 02:44.565
Well, look‐look at the time.
We'd better go.

02:44.598 --> 02:45.832
Bye.

02:45.866 --> 02:46.900
‐ Bye‐bye.
‐ Bye.

02:51.304 --> 02:55.676
Cousin...we are not going to
let him do that to us, are you?

02:55.709 --> 02:56.743
No.

02:59.680 --> 03:02.749
No, we're not. We're gonna
clear this up right now.

03:08.488 --> 03:09.255
[knocking on door]

03:13.259 --> 03:16.997
Mr. Twinkacetti, we need
to talk about our raise.

03:17.030 --> 03:19.533
Oh, yeah, I promised I'd have
an answer for you, didn't I?

03:19.566 --> 03:20.901
You're darn tooting.

03:20.934 --> 03:23.970
Yeah, well, I'm a man
of my word. No raise.

03:28.008 --> 03:29.943
Well, I guess
we're snookered.

03:31.912 --> 03:33.580
[knocking on door]

03:33.614 --> 03:34.581
Hey..

03:37.718 --> 03:38.519
What?

03:38.552 --> 03:40.787
Mr. Twinkacetti,
we are overworked

03:40.821 --> 03:42.756
and underpaid.

03:42.789 --> 03:45.792
I know you're overworked.
I'm not insensitive.

03:45.826 --> 03:47.694
That's why I hired
a new guy to help you out.

03:47.728 --> 03:48.529
Wait a minute.

03:48.562 --> 03:50.631
If you can't afford
to give us a raise

03:50.664 --> 03:52.666
how can you afford
to hire a new man?

03:52.699 --> 03:55.769
Ah, simple economics. It's
the, uh, trickle‐down theory.

03:55.802 --> 03:57.504
You see, the money I'm
gonna pay the new guy

03:57.538 --> 03:59.540
will be trickling
out of your salary.

03:59.573 --> 04:00.340
Sorry.

04:02.709 --> 04:04.511
Alright.
Alright, Twinkacetti.

04:04.545 --> 04:05.879
You pushed me too far.

04:07.447 --> 04:09.716
Every day you insult
me and I take it.

04:09.750 --> 04:11.685
Well, I'm not gonna
take it anymore.

04:11.718 --> 04:13.587
There are a million jobs
out there better than this.

04:13.620 --> 04:15.722
And there are a million
bosses better than you.

04:15.756 --> 04:17.290
I quit.

04:19.860 --> 04:21.995
I quit too!

04:22.028 --> 04:24.330
Balki, I appreciate your
loyalty, and I understand

04:24.364 --> 04:25.632
you're willing
to make a sacrifice

04:25.666 --> 04:27.400
but you don't have to
quit just because I quit.

04:28.401 --> 04:30.070
Yes, I do.

04:30.103 --> 04:31.605
We're a team.

04:31.638 --> 04:33.406
We should be together.

04:33.439 --> 04:36.409
O‐of course, you should stay
together. You share a brain.

04:39.513 --> 04:40.914
Mr. Twinkacetti

04:40.947 --> 04:43.684
you can't talk to Cousin Larry
and me like that anymore.

04:43.717 --> 04:45.786
Like the great
Nancy Sinatra said

04:45.819 --> 04:48.488
"These boots were
made for walking."

04:51.692 --> 04:54.661
Fine. Walk. Who needs you?

04:54.695 --> 04:56.797
Oh, yeah? Oh, yeah?
Well, who needs you?

04:56.830 --> 04:58.331
[door slams shut]

05:00.801 --> 05:02.402
‐ Ha!
‐ Ha ha!

05:02.435 --> 05:04.370
Ha!

05:04.404 --> 05:07.541
‐ That felt pretty good.
‐ Well, you can say that again.

05:07.574 --> 05:08.675
‐ Ha!
‐ Ha ha!

05:08.709 --> 05:09.643
Ha.

05:14.480 --> 05:16.016
‐ Now what do we do?
‐ I don't know.

05:18.151 --> 05:19.119
‐ Ah.
‐ Ah ah.

05:19.152 --> 05:20.854
Ha.

05:20.887 --> 05:23.957
Tomorrow, we go out
and get new jobs.

05:23.990 --> 05:26.660
In America, you can do
anything you want to do.

05:26.693 --> 05:30.030
You just have to
set your sights high.

05:30.063 --> 05:33.099
Could I be chief justice
of the Supreme Court?

05:34.901 --> 05:37.938
Lower, Balki.

05:37.971 --> 05:41.007
[baritone]
Could I be chief justice
of the Supreme Court?

05:41.041 --> 05:43.777
[instrumental music]

05:51.484 --> 05:52.853
"Fat Marsha's?"

05:55.121 --> 05:56.923
This can't be the place.

05:56.957 --> 05:59.492
Well, this is the address
the employment agency gave us.

06:01.695 --> 06:03.664
This place doesn't have
a management program.

06:06.600 --> 06:08.535
A methadone program, maybe.

06:11.037 --> 06:12.973
Okay, we train for that.

06:14.207 --> 06:16.476
Cousin, come on, face it.

06:16.510 --> 06:18.411
We're going to have to
chew the bullet on this one.

06:20.647 --> 06:22.716
It's been two weeks,
the rent is due

06:22.749 --> 06:24.585
and I haven't heard back
from the Supreme Court.

06:27.754 --> 06:29.590
Uh, excuse me.

06:29.623 --> 06:32.192
Uh, we were supposed
to meet a Ms. Manning.

06:32.225 --> 06:34.460
That's me, Fat Marsha.

06:35.896 --> 06:38.064
You don't look fat,
Fat Marsha.

06:38.098 --> 06:39.766
Well, thank you, sweetie.

06:39.800 --> 06:41.735
I used to weigh 300 pounds

06:41.768 --> 06:43.804
but when I opened this
place, I lost my appetite.

06:44.905 --> 06:46.673
Ah.

06:46.707 --> 06:50.644
Now I'm having
the time of my life.

06:50.677 --> 06:53.213
You boys here
about the jobs or..

06:53.246 --> 06:56.016
...are you answering
my ad in the personals?

06:58.652 --> 07:00.220
We're‐we're here
about the jobs.

07:00.253 --> 07:01.722
My name is
Balki Bartokomous

07:01.755 --> 07:03.757
and this is my cousin,
Larry Appleton.

07:05.158 --> 07:07.528
Hey, you're cute.

07:07.561 --> 07:08.862
Uh..

07:08.895 --> 07:10.030
Well, I think
there's been a mistake.

07:10.063 --> 07:12.098
No, you're cute, alright.

07:12.132 --> 07:13.066
[chuckling]

07:14.234 --> 07:15.902
And you're not so bad yourself.

07:15.936 --> 07:17.037
Where are you from?

07:17.070 --> 07:18.939
Oh, I'm from Mypos.

07:18.972 --> 07:20.774
But I can still
work here, can't I?

07:20.807 --> 07:22.475
Well, of course,
you can, darling.

07:22.509 --> 07:25.478
I'm an equal‐opportunity
employer.

07:25.512 --> 07:28.048
Well, I'm
an equal opportunity.

07:32.986 --> 07:34.988
Well, the employment
office sent us here

07:35.021 --> 07:37.858
for management
trainee positions

07:37.891 --> 07:39.760
but I'm sure they gave
us the wrong address.

07:39.793 --> 07:41.995
Ah, no mistake.

07:42.028 --> 07:44.064
My other management
trainees quit.

07:44.097 --> 07:46.066
They were, uh, worn out.

07:46.099 --> 07:48.001
[chuckling]

07:48.034 --> 07:50.070
I'll get you
a couple of uniforms.

07:50.103 --> 07:52.806
Well, no, actually, we
were really looking for

07:52.839 --> 07:55.241
something with career
advancement opportunities.

07:55.275 --> 07:56.777
Well, don't worry, cutie.

07:56.810 --> 07:59.680
I got a feeling you're
gonna advance real fast.

08:12.626 --> 08:14.561
She's got a nice smile.

08:15.562 --> 08:18.498
[instrumental music]

08:22.302 --> 08:26.507
Then...you put
the burger on the bun..

08:27.774 --> 08:31.945
...the bun on the plate.

08:31.978 --> 08:34.981
Then you take
the ticket from the wheel

08:35.015 --> 08:37.283
and you place 'em
both on the counter.

08:38.351 --> 08:40.086
And then you ring the bell.

08:44.858 --> 08:47.561
"Ring the bell."

08:49.329 --> 08:52.098
‐ I like your spirit, Balki.
‐ Oh.

08:52.132 --> 08:53.667
[chuckles]

08:53.700 --> 08:56.837
And you have nice
firm handwriting.

08:59.172 --> 09:01.842
‐ Do you ever arm‐wrestle naked?
‐ Oh!

09:03.376 --> 09:05.979
No. That would
be cheating.

09:08.949 --> 09:09.916
Cheating?

09:09.950 --> 09:12.018
[laughing]
I like that.

09:13.186 --> 09:16.122
Here. Put these on.

09:16.156 --> 09:18.024
[rustling]

09:18.058 --> 09:20.326
No. Like this.

09:26.232 --> 09:28.001
‐ Need a hand, honey?
‐ No, I got it.

09:32.639 --> 09:36.309
Oh, there's something
about a man in uniform

09:36.342 --> 09:38.078
that drives me crazy.

09:43.316 --> 09:46.787
Hmm...I'll see you boys
in a couple of hours.

09:46.820 --> 09:48.955
I'm gonna go pump some iron.

09:52.225 --> 09:55.629
Oh, cousin, you're not
going to believe this.

09:55.662 --> 09:58.331
I already don't believe this.

09:58.364 --> 10:00.601
It's a humongous
can of tuna.

10:02.168 --> 10:04.771
I bet Charlie and his
whole family are in here.

10:06.940 --> 10:10.143
‐ Yes, I bet they are.
‐ And look at this.

10:10.176 --> 10:11.945
A message center.

10:13.213 --> 10:14.715
And this.

10:14.748 --> 10:16.016
[bell rings]

10:16.049 --> 10:17.684
A bell system.

10:18.819 --> 10:21.855
I can't wait to‐to
write home about this.

10:21.888 --> 10:24.124
Balki, wake up and smell
the roach spray.

10:25.859 --> 10:29.029
This place is one step
away from being condemned.

10:29.062 --> 10:32.232
Well, in Mypos, this is
a five‐star restaurant.

10:35.001 --> 10:37.403
This is the best offer
we've had in two weeks.

10:37.437 --> 10:40.040
Alright, alright. Let's try
to make the best of it.

10:40.073 --> 10:42.809
‐ Okay. Uh, I want be the cook.
‐ No.

10:42.843 --> 10:44.010
No, no, I want..

10:44.044 --> 10:45.979
Because then I get
to ring the bell.

10:46.012 --> 10:48.448
Balki, I'll be the cook,
you be the waiter.

10:48.481 --> 10:49.716
‐ No, I want be the cook.
‐ No.

10:49.750 --> 10:50.684
‐ I want be the cook.
‐ No.

10:50.717 --> 10:51.417
‐ You can't be the cook.
‐ I want be the cook.

10:51.451 --> 10:54.888
No, you can't.
Balki, please.

10:54.921 --> 10:56.790
‐ Alright, you can be the cook.
‐ Okay.

11:02.495 --> 11:05.799
Why am I arguing about
the level of my humiliation?

Last time I was in here,
the meat loaf was gritty.

12:01.121 --> 12:02.823
It tasted like sawdust

12:02.856 --> 12:06.492
and the gravy was a kind
of greenish‐brown stuff.

an order of fries.

12:42.195 --> 12:44.430
I don't see
an order of fries.

I just need an order of fries.

you don't get a meal.

12:53.173 --> 12:54.908
I just made that up.

13:01.882 --> 13:02.916
French fries.

13:16.930 --> 13:19.933
I love this machine.
It does shrimp too.

13:21.134 --> 13:22.536
Balki, we don't serve shrimp.

13:22.569 --> 13:24.237
Yes, I know, but if we did

13:24.270 --> 13:26.139
this little baby would fry
their little tails off.

13:29.209 --> 13:32.178
‐ Are these ready?
‐ Well, almost. Okey‐dokey.

13:32.212 --> 13:35.882
Now, we've got two
blackhawk burgers..

13:35.916 --> 13:36.883
[bell rings]

13:36.917 --> 13:38.284
...and one puck burger..

13:38.318 --> 13:39.485
[bell rings]

13:39.520 --> 13:42.488
..and three slap‐shot slaws.

13:42.523 --> 13:43.857
[bell rings]

13:43.890 --> 13:45.892
Balki, I can see the orders.

13:45.926 --> 13:47.528
Do you have to ring the bell?

13:47.561 --> 13:49.495
I have to ring the bell.

13:51.197 --> 13:52.566
Okay.

13:52.599 --> 13:57.904
We got two blackhawks
with slaw..

13:57.938 --> 14:01.608
...and one puck with slaw.

14:01.642 --> 14:03.877
Your French fries are coming.

14:03.910 --> 14:05.111
Your meat loaf
will be out in a sec.

14:05.145 --> 14:06.146
It's soaking.

14:08.148 --> 14:09.583
Anybody need anything?

14:09.616 --> 14:10.651
(customers)
No.

14:10.684 --> 14:11.618
Good.

14:13.987 --> 14:17.423
Balki, this job is a breeze.

14:17.457 --> 14:19.425
I think I'll bring in
a little TV tomorrow.

14:19.459 --> 14:20.994
[sizzling]

14:21.027 --> 14:23.630
Balki, what are you doing?

14:23.664 --> 14:26.499
I'm putting 25
patties on the grill.

14:26.533 --> 14:29.469
Marsha told me to do that
for the four o'clock rush.

14:31.171 --> 14:33.073
She also told me she's
taking me to Club Med

14:33.106 --> 14:34.975
but you don't see me packing.

14:37.944 --> 14:39.546
You got vacation already?

14:41.414 --> 14:45.218
No, Balki, I mean,
it's four o'clock now.

14:45.251 --> 14:46.452
You're looking at the rush.

14:46.486 --> 14:49.389
Well, no, cousin, Marsha told me
there was going to be a rush.

14:49.422 --> 14:51.525
Ah, Balki, come here.

14:51.558 --> 14:53.527
Come on. Look outside.

14:54.427 --> 14:55.361
[bell rings]

14:57.664 --> 15:00.701
Okay? Do you see a rush?

15:00.734 --> 15:02.135
I see a big herd
of people coming

15:02.168 --> 15:04.004
across the street
from the stadium.

15:05.739 --> 15:09.475
Oh, my Lord. There must
have been a game today.

15:09.510 --> 15:12.478
Cousin, they're pulling
the parking meters

15:12.513 --> 15:14.180
out of the ground.

15:15.516 --> 15:17.283
There must have
been a hockey game.

15:17.317 --> 15:20.220
Oh, that was the worst
game I've ever seen!

15:20.253 --> 15:22.989
[indistinct shouting]

15:25.491 --> 15:28.228
[intense music]

15:29.162 --> 15:30.664
[instrumental music]

15:34.635 --> 15:37.571
[indistinct shouting]

15:44.778 --> 15:46.613
Hey, I haven't
ordered yet.

15:46.647 --> 15:48.414
Alright, yes.
Who had the puck burger?

15:48.448 --> 15:50.684
‐ Where is my chili dog?
‐ I don't know.

15:50.717 --> 15:52.418
Here, have a puck burger.

15:52.452 --> 15:53.419
[indistinct shouting]

15:53.453 --> 15:56.256
Hurry up.
What's wrong with you?

15:56.289 --> 15:58.058
‐ 'What's going on?'
‐ Hey!

15:58.091 --> 15:59.192
When are you
gonna take my order?

15:59.225 --> 16:00.994
Yeah, I'm a little
busy right now.

16:01.027 --> 16:02.362
(male #1)
'Yeah, right!'

16:02.395 --> 16:03.530
Balki, what are you doing?

16:03.564 --> 16:06.667
I‐I lost my
place on the wheel.

16:06.700 --> 16:08.401
Pat Sajak makes
it look so easy.

16:08.434 --> 16:11.404
Alright. Balki. Balki.

16:11.437 --> 16:12.739
Don't go to
pieces on me now.

16:12.773 --> 16:14.074
I need you. I need..

16:14.107 --> 16:15.676
Be here for me.

16:15.709 --> 16:17.277
‐ I will.
‐ Alright, come on.

16:17.310 --> 16:18.411
Alright, all
we gotta do is

16:18.444 --> 16:20.514
just put these
things together here.

16:20.547 --> 16:23.784
I'll just put them together.
Everything will be fine.

16:23.817 --> 16:27.120
We're just gonna get these
fries in all the orders.

16:27.153 --> 16:30.023
If we put the fries on all
of these, we're gonna be fine.

16:30.056 --> 16:32.225
Balki, Balki, Balki.

16:32.258 --> 16:34.060
Are you with me, buddy?

16:34.094 --> 16:35.696
‐ Yes, I am.
‐ Alright. Alright.

16:35.729 --> 16:38.799
Hey! I'd like to eat
while I still have my teeth.

16:38.832 --> 16:41.201
‐ 'Yeah!'
‐ Alright, here we go. Coming.

16:41.234 --> 16:42.736
I'm still waiting
for my chili dog.

16:42.769 --> 16:45.471
It's coming, it's coming. You'll
be amazed how fast it comes.

16:45.506 --> 16:48.241
[indistinct shouting]

16:50.577 --> 16:54.548
Okay, you have the blackhawk
burgers and the puck pups.

16:54.581 --> 16:57.651
‐ I still haven't ordered yet.
‐ Well, I ordered for you.

16:57.684 --> 17:00.621
[indistinct shouting]

17:03.690 --> 17:06.492
Who do I have to kill to
get a chili dog around here?

17:06.527 --> 17:08.294
Uh, it's ready right now.
I'll get it. I'm gonna get it.

17:09.630 --> 17:13.366
Balki. Balki, I need
a chili dog desperately.

17:13.398 --> 17:15.367
Well, cousin, we're
all out of chili.

17:15.401 --> 17:17.671
What do you mean we're out of
chili? We can't be out of chili.

17:17.704 --> 17:21.340
Well, but, well, it, my chili
happens to be very popular.

17:21.374 --> 17:24.444
Balki, there is a man
over there who will kill me

17:24.477 --> 17:27.113
if I don't give him
a chili dog right now.

17:27.146 --> 17:28.715
Well, cousin,
we're out of chili.

17:28.749 --> 17:31.417
I don't know what to tell you.
Read my lips, we're out of‐‐

17:31.451 --> 17:32.719
Hey, bozos.

17:34.120 --> 17:36.389
(Larry and Balki)
Hi.

17:36.422 --> 17:38.559
I still don't have my chili dog.

17:39.492 --> 17:41.327
Coming.

17:41.361 --> 17:43.496
‐ Is that him?
‐ Yes, yes, that's him.

17:43.530 --> 17:44.598
Well, then I suggest
we find some chili.

17:44.631 --> 17:47.601
Okay.

17:47.634 --> 17:49.736
Okay, okay.

17:49.770 --> 17:53.106
‐ What is it?
‐ Well, I‐I found something.

17:53.139 --> 17:56.076
‐ What is it?
‐ It looks something like chili.

17:58.311 --> 17:59.780
It's green.

18:00.581 --> 18:02.549
I'm waiting.

18:02.583 --> 18:03.416
Close enough.

18:18.331 --> 18:19.465
There you go.

18:19.499 --> 18:20.901
Uh, this was
supposed to be to go.

18:20.934 --> 18:22.435
Right, yes, of course.

18:27.273 --> 18:29.543
Here you go. On the house.

18:29.576 --> 18:31.311
[rustling]

18:35.315 --> 18:37.317
Watch where you're
walking, jerk face.

18:37.350 --> 18:40.787
Hey, how would you like me to
walk on your face, dirt ball?

18:40.821 --> 18:43.524
Now, who you calling
a dirt ball, you jerk face?

18:43.557 --> 18:45.358
‐ You, horse breath!
‐ Fight!

18:45.391 --> 18:47.460
[all shouting]
Fight! Fight! Fight!

18:52.232 --> 18:55.335
We have a very strict
no‐fighting policy.

18:55.368 --> 18:58.304
[indistinct shouting]

19:10.416 --> 19:11.384
[whistle blows]

19:11.417 --> 19:12.853
Okay, break it up.

19:12.886 --> 19:15.922
Put them down. Carefully.

19:15.956 --> 19:17.758
(customers)
Ah‐h‐h.

19:21.227 --> 19:22.796
Well, these two
hockey pucks started it.

19:22.829 --> 19:24.965
Out. Now.

19:24.998 --> 19:27.668
‐ Are we still on for tonight?
‐ Are we still on for tonight?

19:27.701 --> 19:29.435
I'll let you know.

19:30.871 --> 19:33.239
I‐I‐I can explain everything.

19:33.273 --> 19:34.440
Well, there's
nothing to explain.

19:34.474 --> 19:37.443
It's always like this
during hockey season.

19:37.477 --> 19:39.379
‐ You okay, honeybunch?
‐ What..

19:42.382 --> 19:44.551
Well, you okay, Balki?

19:44.585 --> 19:47.353
Well, I‐I got a little
something in my eye, but I..

19:47.387 --> 19:48.989
Well, good,
because I was afraid

19:49.022 --> 19:50.691
you'd broken
something important.

19:50.724 --> 19:51.725
No, no.

19:51.758 --> 19:52.492
[laughing]

19:57.764 --> 20:01.401
I‐I‐I think she just
invited me to Club Med.

20:02.936 --> 20:05.672
[instrumental music]

20:12.713 --> 20:14.447
[panting]

20:17.551 --> 20:20.486
[panting continues]

20:24.558 --> 20:26.292
Why were those
dogs chasing us?

20:28.762 --> 20:30.731
Because we smell
like cheap hamburger.

20:32.398 --> 20:35.569
[panting]

20:35.602 --> 20:39.973
You smell like
cheap hamburger. I..

20:40.006 --> 20:41.742
I'm not sure
what I smell like.

20:43.076 --> 20:44.878
I can't believe it.

20:44.911 --> 20:46.613
We actually
managed to find jobs

20:46.647 --> 20:48.815
that are worse than
working for Twinkacetti.

20:48.849 --> 20:51.818
Oh, cousin, it
wasn't all that bad.

20:51.852 --> 20:54.921
"Wasn't all that bad?"

20:54.955 --> 20:58.391
Balki, we spent the day
feeding tainted meat

20:58.424 --> 21:00.026
to homicidal hockey fans.

21:01.995 --> 21:04.397
N‐not to mention
being sexually harassed

21:04.430 --> 21:05.966
by the Amazing Colossal Woman.

21:07.801 --> 21:10.470
What job could be worse?

21:10.504 --> 21:12.773
Well, what about that
lady I saw on television

21:12.806 --> 21:15.275
that has to check the waistbands
on men's underwear?

21:21.381 --> 21:23.717
What I meant was we should
have taken the pay cut

21:23.750 --> 21:25.451
and stayed
with Twinkacetti.

21:25.485 --> 21:26.486
[knocking on door]

21:34.528 --> 21:37.463
Oh, Mr. And Mrs. Twinkacetti.

21:37.497 --> 21:38.532
I know the rent is due

21:38.565 --> 21:39.800
but we don't get paid
until the end of the week.

21:39.833 --> 21:44.370
Don't worry about that, boys.
I just found out why you quit.

21:44.404 --> 21:46.006
Donald has something
he wants to say.

21:47.373 --> 21:48.909
Speak, Donald.

21:52.012 --> 21:55.716
I'd, uh, like you to
come back to work for me.

21:55.749 --> 21:57.718
Well, uh, what happened
to the new man?

21:57.751 --> 22:00.486
He's history.
Tell them why, Donald.

22:00.521 --> 22:02.388
That bum was
stealing me blind.

22:02.422 --> 22:05.358
Now, you two are losers, but
at least you're honest losers.

22:06.660 --> 22:08.595
High praise indeed.

22:10.797 --> 22:12.398
Well, Mr. Twinkacetti,
we would love

22:12.432 --> 22:13.466
to come back
and work for you

22:13.499 --> 22:16.570
but it's not possible,
because we've got new jobs

22:16.603 --> 22:18.038
and we're
management trainees

22:18.071 --> 22:19.806
and we're advancing
rather rapidly.

22:19.840 --> 22:22.475
‐ Balki.
‐ Uh, uh..

22:22.509 --> 22:24.377
On the other hand,
every management trainee

22:24.410 --> 22:25.746
has his price.

22:27.848 --> 22:29.583
Yes, yes, I see.

22:34.888 --> 22:36.623
But we'd be willing
to hear your offer.

22:38.825 --> 22:41.562
Make 'em an offer, Donald.

22:41.595 --> 22:43.396
I was just gonna
do that, sweetheart.

22:43.429 --> 22:46.767
Uh, let's say, same job,
same pay, no hard feelings.

22:46.800 --> 22:47.701
What do you say?

22:54.841 --> 22:56.577
Let's say we get the raise

22:56.610 --> 22:57.944
we should've gotten
in the first place

22:57.978 --> 22:59.613
you pay us overtime

22:59.646 --> 23:01.481
and we never hear
the word losers again.

23:01.915 --> 23:02.849
[grunts]

23:04.084 --> 23:05.886
Donald says yes.

23:11.758 --> 23:14.460
Can I go now?
I still got dishes to do.

23:16.229 --> 23:17.798
Of course, dear.

23:17.831 --> 23:19.600
It's nice to have
you back, boys.

23:19.633 --> 23:21.935
‐ Oh, thank you.
‐ Thank you, Mrs. Twinkacetti.

23:24.605 --> 23:26.540
Do yourselves a favor.

23:27.473 --> 23:28.909
Burn these clothes.

23:31.111 --> 23:32.546
‐ Bye‐bye.
‐ Bye.

23:35.549 --> 23:37.551
How do you
like that, Balki?

23:37.584 --> 23:40.453
‐ We got our jobs back.
‐ Yeah.

23:40.486 --> 23:41.755
[both sigh]

23:44.591 --> 23:47.027
Why don't we feel happy?

23:47.060 --> 23:49.563
Maybe it's because we're going
back to same the crummy jobs

23:49.596 --> 23:51.565
we hated two weeks ago.

23:51.598 --> 23:54.234
That's a good point,
a very good point.

23:54.267 --> 23:57.203
Well, this is one
way to look at it.

23:57.237 --> 23:59.573
We're not going to
have those jobs forever.

23:59.606 --> 24:01.174
You came to Chicago
to be a photographer

24:01.207 --> 24:02.976
and you will be.

24:03.009 --> 24:04.578
Yeah.

24:04.611 --> 24:05.912
And you didn't travel
thousands of miles

24:05.946 --> 24:08.014
to be a clerk in
a discount store.

24:08.048 --> 24:09.750
Yeah.

24:09.783 --> 24:11.217
Someday I'll graduate
from night school

24:11.251 --> 24:12.619
and I'll go to college.

24:12.653 --> 24:14.054
Yeah.

24:14.087 --> 24:16.690
And then we can tell Twinkacetti
what to do with our jobs

24:16.723 --> 24:18.058
and we can mean it.

24:18.091 --> 24:19.893
Yeah!

24:19.926 --> 24:23.096
Cousin, I'm getting happy.

24:23.129 --> 24:25.165
Do you know what
I feel coming on?

24:25.198 --> 24:28.234
‐ A dance of joy?
‐ Yes!
