WEBVTT

00:01.040 --> 00:04.822
It's not a bachelorette party, we're just
meeting up to go over a few last minutes things.

00:04.822 --> 00:06.005
So, no male strippers?

00:06.005 --> 00:08.798
No, it's at Nora's house.

00:08.798 --> 00:10.855
- Hey morning.
- Hey morning.

00:10.855 --> 00:12.477
Is that Justin? Yeah, dad, I gotta go...

00:13.531 --> 00:16.050
Did you talk to him yet?

00:16.216 --> 00:17.415
- No, I will, I will.
- When?

00:17.415 --> 00:18.415
Ok, can we talk about this later?

00:18.415 --> 00:22.466
I don't mean to keep pressuring sure, but you're
pregnant. You... you have to tell him before the wedding.

00:22.466 --> 00:24.447
Yeah, all right, I  love you too, bye.

00:24.447 --> 00:27.074
Hey, have you seen my keys?

00:27.468 --> 00:29.570
You're not getting away
that easy, Mrs. Walker-to-be.

00:29.570 --> 00:30.705
I thought you wanted to sleep in.

00:30.705 --> 00:32.442
I mean, this is your
first day off in forever.

00:32.442 --> 00:33.790
Yeah, so let's start it off right.

00:33.790 --> 00:34.656
I'm serious, okay?

00:34.656 --> 00:35.994
I really need you to
help me find my keys.

00:35.994 --> 00:36.653
I have to go.

00:38.188 --> 00:39.873
Look, my midterms are
finally over, all right?

00:39.873 --> 00:40.783
I think I aced 'em.

00:40.783 --> 00:42.387
Here they are. Okay, listen, I'm sorry.

00:42.422 --> 00:44.076
There's just so much going
on before the wedding.

00:44.076 --> 00:46.978
I'll call you later. Go
get some rest. You need it.

00:50.258 --> 00:52.550
God, who knew a fertility
clinic could be so steril.

00:52.550 --> 00:54.561
What were you expecting, silk sheets?

00:54.561 --> 00:56.189
I feel like I'm about
to have my teeth cleaned,

00:56.224 --> 00:59.532
- not make a baby.
- You'll be fine.

00:59.600 --> 01:01.134
Will you come with me?

01:01.202 --> 01:03.512
No. It's a clinic, not a motel.

01:03.512 --> 01:04.417
Yeah, well, what if I can't, you know

01:04.417 --> 01:05.738
well, that's what the porn's for.

01:06.618 --> 01:08.169
- Porn, really?
- Oh, yeah.

01:08.169 --> 01:10.837
There's, like, a smorgasbord
of smut and filth back there.

01:10.837 --> 01:12.975
Oh, when I did this for Tommy and Julia,

01:12.975 --> 01:13.920
there was this one...

01:13.920 --> 01:17.880
- Wait. What was it called?
- Oh.

01:19.894 --> 01:20.786
Gentlemen...

01:20.786 --> 01:22.322
which one of you would like to go first?

01:22.390 --> 01:24.291
I will.

01:26.861 --> 01:29.229
- Mom.
- I'm in the shower.

01:29.297 --> 01:31.264
Oh, hey, mom. Hey, you know what?

01:31.332 --> 01:33.174
It is such a beautiful day,
I thought maybe we could

01:33.174 --> 01:35.066
go do something with
Evan. How about the park?

01:35.066 --> 01:36.202
That's good. Let's do that.

01:36.202 --> 01:40.840
Great. We have to make
sure she's not there.

01:40.908 --> 01:42.809
She?

01:42.877 --> 01:44.978
- Shh. Nora, I think she's still here.
- Oh, my God.

01:45.046 --> 01:46.913
Kitty, get out of here!

01:46.981 --> 01:48.882
Oh! Oh, my God! Oh, oh.

01:51.798 --> 01:54.754
Oh, my God. Look at this place.

01:54.822 --> 01:57.123
Did your mother pass away last night?

01:57.191 --> 01:58.658
Au contraire.

01:58.726 --> 02:00.960
I just walked in on her and Simon...

02:01.028 --> 02:02.729
in the shower...

02:02.797 --> 02:04.364
together...

02:04.432 --> 02:05.899
Naked.

02:05.966 --> 02:07.867
Good for her.

02:07.935 --> 02:11.371
It's a whole new day in Pasadena.

02:11.439 --> 02:13.606
Oysters.

02:13.674 --> 02:15.875
Kitty. Oh, Kitty, I'm so sorry.

02:15.943 --> 02:17.204
I... I should've locked
the door. I just didn't...

02:17.511 --> 02:18.683
Oh, no, no, no. I'm sorry, mom.

02:18.683 --> 02:21.314
I'm so sorry. But I can't
even look at you right now.

02:21.382 --> 02:23.917
Well, I'm having a hard
time looking at you, too.

02:23.984 --> 02:26.386
Can we look at the coffee pot?
'Cause there's nothing brewing.

02:26.454 --> 02:29.255
Oh, I forgot to set it. Sorry.

02:29.323 --> 02:31.691
But I'll do that right
now. As soon as I...

02:31.759 --> 02:33.626
Oh, sorry, folks. We're out of eggs.

02:33.694 --> 02:36.896
We'll have to have cold
cereal this morning.

02:36.964 --> 02:39.399
And we can't have that
because we're all out of milk.

02:39.467 --> 02:41.501
We always have milk.

02:41.569 --> 02:43.803
The Northridge earthquake,
el Nino the L.A. riots...

02:43.871 --> 02:45.939
We always have milk.

02:46.006 --> 02:48.041
Kitty, if you feel
that strongly about mi,

02:48.109 --> 02:50.377
Then get in the car and go get some. No.

02:50.444 --> 02:52.000
I want to know what happened
to my mother, mrs. Robinson.

02:52.000 --> 02:53.214
Please.

02:53.961 --> 02:55.923
Hey, I'm sorry about what
just happened in there.

02:55.923 --> 02:58.218
- Hey.
- Hey.

03:00.121 --> 03:02.188
Uh, coffee?

03:02.256 --> 03:03.723
Uh, I'd love some.

03:03.791 --> 03:05.592
Oh, but it isn't ready yet,

03:05.659 --> 03:07.093
And there isn't any milk.

03:07.161 --> 03:10.964
He drinks it black.

03:13.100 --> 03:15.335
- I'm Robert.
- Simon.

03:15.403 --> 03:16.084
Yeah, we met, I think,
at, Nora's benefit.

03:16.327 --> 03:18.575
Justin's robe probably threw you off.

03:18.610 --> 03:19.639
Hey!

03:19.707 --> 03:22.475
Look. There's a baked
Alaska from last night.

03:22.543 --> 03:24.811
Anyone want it?

03:24.879 --> 03:27.046
Au revoir.

03:28.682 --> 03:31.317
So long.

03:33.020 --> 03:35.388
Au revoir.

03:35.456 --> 03:38.291
You'll be glad to know,
I'm attempting closure.

03:38.359 --> 03:40.427
I just dragged Luc into the trash...

03:40.494 --> 03:42.061
You're never gonna believe this.

03:42.129 --> 03:44.464
I just caught mom in
the shower with Simon.

03:44.532 --> 03:46.032
Oh, my God.

03:46.100 --> 03:48.034
Did you see...

03:48.102 --> 03:49.889
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Thank God there's a curtain.

03:49.889 --> 03:50.830
But were they doing it?

03:50.830 --> 03:53.074
I don't know. Maybe, maybe.
But her bed was unmade.

03:53.074 --> 03:53.949
I can't believe this.

03:53.949 --> 03:56.633
I get dumped and my mom's
having hot shower sex?

03:56.633 --> 03:57.700
Just shoot me now.

03:57.700 --> 03:59.759
Yeah, well, don't worry.
I gave her a hard time.

03:59.759 --> 04:02.128
Hi, Kevin.

04:02.128 --> 04:03.841
- I get to tell him.
- Hey, Sarah. How you doing?

04:03.841 --> 04:05.585
Mom's having a torrid
affair in the shower.

04:05.585 --> 04:06.187
What?

04:06.187 --> 04:08.157
- Thanks a lot, Sarah.
- Sorry, Kit. He called me first.

04:08.157 --> 04:10.081
Besides, you have a
husband. Just give me this.

04:10.081 --> 04:12.210
I am so regretting being a
sympathetic brother right now.

04:12.210 --> 04:14.564
If this is a pity call, you
can just go back to work.

04:14.564 --> 04:15.488
I'm not at work.

04:15.488 --> 04:17.512
I'm waiting for my husband
to finish masturbating.

04:17.512 --> 04:19.247
Yeah, well, sometimes
it's easier that way.

04:19.247 --> 04:20.839
No, we're at the fertility clinic.

04:20.839 --> 04:22.369
- We're getting tested today.
- Hello!

04:22.369 --> 04:23.361
Hang on.

04:24.782 --> 04:27.638
Okay, you're both on speaker.
Talk amongst yourselves.

04:27.638 --> 04:28.198
Oh, Kevin.

04:28.198 --> 04:31.030
You wouldn't have believed it.
She's all googly-eyed with...

04:31.030 --> 04:34.268
With that after-sex glow,
and... and I swear to God,

04:34.268 --> 04:35.536
I thought they were gonna
light up in the kitchen.

04:35.536 --> 04:37.550
I really can't listen to this right now.

04:39.487 --> 04:40.420
Your turn.

04:40.488 --> 04:43.456
There is not a dvd in the
whole of West Hollywood

04:43.524 --> 04:45.199
that could counteract what I just heard.

04:45.199 --> 04:48.140
- Oh, that's Justin.
- Justin. I get to tell... do I get to tell Justin?

04:48.140 --> 04:49.143
- Hold on.
- No, no, no, take it.

04:49.143 --> 04:51.257
Look, if there's a chance
in hell of me procreating,

04:51.257 --> 04:52.897
I have to hang up right now. Bye.

04:55.032 --> 04:57.667
Hey, uh, how's it going?

04:57.667 --> 04:59.798
Am I on suicide watch or something?

04:59.798 --> 05:00.626
No, I just wanted to see

05:00.627 --> 05:02.350
if you and Luc wanted
to hang out tonight.

05:02.350 --> 05:03.494
Oh, Justin.

05:03.707 --> 05:06.193
- Luc left.
- What, he left? Left where?

05:06.193 --> 05:06.980
He dumped me.

05:06.980 --> 05:09.338
Oh, no. I'm sorry. I didn't...
I didn't know that happened.

05:09.338 --> 05:10.490
Ah, it's okay. I'll get over it.

05:10.490 --> 05:12.933
Anyway, there's better news.

05:12.933 --> 05:14.988
Mom's having hot shower sex with Simon.

05:15.286 --> 05:18.031
Eww. Who's Simon? Oh,
wait. The motorcycle guy?

05:18.031 --> 05:19.143
Yeah, the guy she's been dating.

05:19.143 --> 05:20.443
- She's dating him?
- Yeah.

05:20.443 --> 05:22.961
- Where I have been?
- Uh, medical school.

05:22.961 --> 05:25.120
Oh, in case it comes as
a surprise to you, Justin,

05:25.120 --> 05:27.400
you are getting married,
and I'm about to meet

05:27.400 --> 05:28.765
your fiancÃ©e at the dress shop.

05:28.765 --> 05:31.171
- Well, tell her I said hi.
- I will.

05:31.206 --> 05:33.626
Listen, guys. I've really
gotta get back to work.

05:32.625 --> 05:34.379
I will see you later.

05:34.379 --> 05:36.810
Hopefully they'll be out
of the shower by then. Bye.

05:36.810 --> 05:37.567
Bye.

05:45.154 --> 05:46.986
No, I'm not hungry.

05:47.054 --> 05:48.405
You gotta eat something, Holly.

05:48.405 --> 05:50.390
Well, I'll eat later.

05:50.457 --> 05:53.626
Besides, I want to fit into my ess.

05:53.694 --> 05:55.628
You know, you're not fooling anybody

05:55.696 --> 05:58.865
with this pre-wedding diet routine.

05:58.933 --> 06:01.601
You're a nervous wreck. That's
why you're not eating anything.

06:01.669 --> 06:04.504
So what do you want me to say?

06:04.572 --> 06:06.940
That you'll deal with the
reality of the situation.

06:07.007 --> 06:09.142
That you'll cut back on the music

06:09.209 --> 06:10.148
and the shellfish tower
or the 12-layer cake...

06:10.148 --> 06:12.480
No. It is our daughter's wedding.

06:12.480 --> 06:14.052
That you can't afford to pay for.

06:14.052 --> 06:16.648
Your broker is in jail,
your money has evaporated.

06:16.648 --> 06:19.273
What are you gonna do, Holly,
put it on another credit card?

06:19.273 --> 06:20.787
You've maxed out three.

06:20.787 --> 06:22.698
What bank do you think
is gonna pay for that?

06:22.698 --> 06:25.179
So glad I stayed home this morning.

06:26.395 --> 06:28.861
Holly, you're broke.

06:28.929 --> 06:31.497
If you insist on having
the wedding your way,

06:31.565 --> 06:33.700
the is one person that
can help you do it.

06:33.767 --> 06:36.302
No. I amot asking Nora.

06:36.370 --> 06:38.404
She is the mother of the groom.

06:38.472 --> 06:39.693
She would be willing to
help you with some of this.

06:39.693 --> 06:40.476
Yeah, yeah, she would help me,

06:40.476 --> 06:42.410
and then she would rub it in my face.

06:42.410 --> 06:46.179
If I ask Nora for money,
it's like nothing's changed.

06:46.246 --> 06:47.780
After all these years,

06:47.848 --> 06:51.651
I'm still dependent on
William Walker's money.

06:51.719 --> 06:53.586
You're gonna land on
your feet. I promise.

06:53.654 --> 06:55.488
And it's not like this is the only thing

06:55.556 --> 06:57.991
that the kids need help with.

06:58.058 --> 06:59.592
What else do they need?

06:59.660 --> 07:02.362
They have an apartment. They have jobs.

07:02.429 --> 07:04.764
Look, I just... I meant in the future.

07:04.832 --> 07:09.035
They're starting a life together.

07:09.103 --> 07:12.171
Don't put this wedding at
risk because of your pride.

07:12.239 --> 07:13.640
It's not worth it.

07:13.707 --> 07:15.742
I... I... j...

07:15.809 --> 07:19.779
I... I just can't believe that
I don't have some other option.

07:21.749 --> 07:23.516
So tonight, we definitely...

07:23.584 --> 07:25.533
we have to go over the food,
we have to go over the flowers,

07:25.533 --> 07:27.145
oh, and we have to definitely
go over your makeup.

07:27.145 --> 07:28.118
Um, Kitty, I think they
took it in too much.

07:29.223 --> 07:31.124
What's that? Let me see.

07:31.191 --> 07:33.526
I think... I think they
took it in too much.

07:33.594 --> 07:35.828
Oh, my God, Rebecca.

07:35.896 --> 07:38.031
Oh, Rebecca. That is so beautiful.

07:38.098 --> 07:39.730
It's... it's... it's...
okay, do a twirl. Do a twirl.

07:39.730 --> 07:41.300
Okay, well, that... that's...
that's kinda the problem.

07:42.492 --> 07:46.082
Well, hang on. Hang on.
Just... just a minute.

07:46.082 --> 07:49.290
Excuse me. I... I think... I
think maybe you made a mistake.

07:49.290 --> 07:51.054
It just... it seems a little tight.

07:51.311 --> 07:52.560
- It's really tight.
- Yeah.

07:52.560 --> 07:54.514
Mm-hmm.

07:54.581 --> 07:55.948
I love it.

07:56.016 --> 07:57.083
Let's...

07:57.151 --> 07:59.652
No mistake.

07:59.720 --> 08:02.088
You get, uh, boob job?

08:02.156 --> 08:04.809
No. No, I didn't. No,
no. I didn't get a...

08:04.809 --> 08:06.392
No, of course... of
course. I'm... I'm sorry.

08:06.460 --> 08:09.595
Can you just give us a moment, please?

08:09.663 --> 08:12.031
Rebecca, this is no big
deal. This is no big deal.

08:12.099 --> 08:14.600
We can have this easily
fixed. Kitty, I can't breathe.

08:14.668 --> 08:15.462
Okay. I can't breathe. Can you just...

08:15.462 --> 08:17.044
Okay, okay, okay. Easy
does it. Easy does it.

08:17.044 --> 08:17.883
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

08:17.883 --> 08:18.645
I got it. I got it. Rebecca, what is it?

08:18.645 --> 08:19.679
No, I can't... I can't talk about it.

08:19.679 --> 08:22.364
- Rebecca, is it... is it Justin?
- No, it's not Justin.

08:22.364 --> 08:22.771
Come on. You can tell me anything.

08:22.771 --> 08:24.698
Kitty, no, I can tell you. I
haven't even told Justin yet.

08:27.215 --> 08:28.448
Oh, my God.

08:30.017 --> 08:32.385
Are you pregnant?

08:33.756 --> 08:34.654
Yeah.

08:35.595 --> 08:36.621
Oh.

08:36.890 --> 08:37.921
Kitty, you can't tell anybody.

08:37.921 --> 08:40.528
Don't worry. Don't worry. Don't worry.

08:40.528 --> 08:41.457
It's gonna be okay.

08:41.890 --> 08:43.217
It's okay.

08:54.118 --> 08:56.019
I thought I'd find you here.

08:56.087 --> 08:57.654
Oh, well, I... I still...

08:57.722 --> 08:59.756
I don't get it.

08:59.824 --> 09:03.160
I mean, this system is
practically brand-new.

09:03.227 --> 09:06.263
I know. It doesn't
make any sense, does it?

09:06.330 --> 09:09.766
- Mm. So what happened?
- I don't know, Holly. They're looking into the valves.

09:09.834 --> 09:12.469
But we have to let the
investigators do their work,

09:12.537 --> 09:14.704
which, unfortunately, will take weeks.

09:14.772 --> 09:18.141
But for now, we both know
that we shouldn't be in here.

09:18.209 --> 09:20.110
Right.

09:20.178 --> 09:22.812
If we start at 3:00, we'll be off...

09:22.880 --> 09:25.282
- Justin, hey.
- Hey.

09:25.349 --> 09:28.318
- What are you doing here?
- I just came to steal Kevin for some lunch.

09:28.386 --> 09:30.720
- But I guess he's not here.
- No, no, he's at the fertility clinic

09:30.788 --> 09:32.822
getting his little swimmers checked out.

09:32.890 --> 09:36.159
Oh, uh, I... I think we got
this, guys. Thanks a lot.

09:36.227 --> 09:38.995
- Hey, have you seen, uh, the picture of the egg donor?
- Excuse me.

09:39.063 --> 09:41.765
Egg donor? I didn't
even know he picked one.

09:41.832 --> 09:44.067
I guess I've been in a,
uh, med-school-induced coma

09:44.135 --> 09:46.203
for the past three months.

09:46.270 --> 09:48.171
So how, um, how are midterms?

09:48.239 --> 09:50.507
Good, I think. You know,
they mail the results.

09:50.575 --> 09:52.943
So I'm trying not to think about it.

09:53.010 --> 09:56.012
I hear they're having
a... a marriage powwow

09:56.080 --> 09:58.915
- at the house tonight?
- Yeah, I think they're making a quilt

09:58.983 --> 10:01.685
- or sacrificing a chickenor something.
- So what about you?

10:01.752 --> 10:04.287
Who's throwing the bachelor party?

10:04.355 --> 10:06.289
Oh, um, you know, believe it or not,

10:06.357 --> 10:09.159
I'm actually... I'm not much
of a strip club guy, so...

10:09.227 --> 10:11.228
Wait a... wait a minute.

10:11.295 --> 10:14.164
No self-respecting guy let's
another man walk the plank

10:14.232 --> 10:16.299
without a proper send-off.

10:16.367 --> 10:19.302
- So I'm throwing you a bachelor party.
- No, you don't have to...

10:19.370 --> 10:21.204
- No, no, yeah, tonight. You in?
- Uh, yeah, yeah.

10:21.272 --> 10:22.706
Good. Of course. Yeah...

10:22.773 --> 10:25.075
Oh, it's your sister.

10:25.142 --> 10:26.576
Hey, sweetie.

10:26.644 --> 10:29.679
Hey, Rebecca's pregnant, and
she hasn't told Justin yet.

10:31.349 --> 10:32.282
Really?

10:32.350 --> 10:34.217
Did you hear me?

10:34.285 --> 10:37.587
- Yes.
- Robert, what am I gonna do?

10:37.655 --> 10:40.423
I'm sitting with Justin right now.

10:40.491 --> 10:43.560
- What is she talking about?
- Oh, right. Okay. Just act... act cool.

10:43.628 --> 10:45.962
- Well, my lips are sealed.
- All right, you know what?

10:46.030 --> 10:48.365
- Let me... let me talk to her.
- Okay, so what do you think my options are?

10:48.432 --> 10:50.634
- They're getting married in a week.
- Well, that sounds great.

10:50.701 --> 10:52.869
Okay. Goodbye. She had to go.

10:52.937 --> 10:56.806
Well, what was that all
about, wedding secrets?

10:56.874 --> 10:58.908
As a matter of fact, it is.

11:00.978 --> 11:03.046
I just... all right? I'm gonna...

11:03.114 --> 11:05.215
- Yes. Okay, just separate...
- I'm separating.

11:05.283 --> 11:08.251
Don't... ee-oh. Now where...
where do you want me to put the...

11:08.319 --> 11:10.353
- In the sink.
- Don't you think the sink's full enough, mom?

11:10.421 --> 11:12.722
Sarah, I thought you were here

11:12.790 --> 11:16.259
- to go over the menus for the rehearsal dinner.
- I am.

11:16.327 --> 11:19.629
- I'm just waiting on Scotty to weigh in.
- I... I think I...

11:19.697 --> 11:21.765
- Eww, you got shells in it.
- Just got a little in.

11:21.832 --> 11:24.100
Eww. No, I'll help you
here. All right, all right.

11:24.168 --> 11:26.970
- What are you two whipping up exactly?
- Quiche, can't you tell?

11:27.038 --> 11:29.673
Actually, I think your...
your mom's whipping it up.

11:29.740 --> 11:32.509
- I'm screwing it up.
- No, you're not screwing it up. You're learning.

11:34.845 --> 11:37.747
Oh, hey. Hi. I'm gonna
get this in the oven,

11:37.815 --> 11:40.617
- and then I'll help you with the menus.
- Mom's a little preoccupied.

11:40.685 --> 11:42.819
Ah. So what's with the, uh, cool music?

11:42.887 --> 11:46.423
- Oh, Simon programmed mom's ipod.
- Finally.

11:46.490 --> 11:48.992
- I've been a little busy with you kids.
- Made a few playlists.

11:49.060 --> 11:51.361
This is "coolest 3."

11:51.429 --> 11:52.829
- 3?
- 2.

11:52.897 --> 11:54.597
- 2?
- I think it's 2.

11:54.665 --> 11:57.033
- It's 2. Oops.
- Well, you guys surely have been busy.

11:57.101 --> 11:59.502
Simon, don't you have cells to divide

11:59.570 --> 12:02.505
- or research or something?
- As a matter of fact,

12:02.573 --> 12:05.508
- I was in the lab first thing this morning.
- You got a lot done this morning by the sounds of it.

12:05.576 --> 12:08.078
- Sarah.
- What?

12:08.145 --> 12:09.846
No, no, Sarah's right.

12:09.914 --> 12:12.816
Doctors shouldn't just hang
around making quiche all day.

12:12.883 --> 12:15.251
Which is why I should
get ready to head back.

12:15.319 --> 12:17.687
- See ya.
- Uh, I'm gonna walk him to the door.

12:17.755 --> 12:20.557
Scotty, just put this
in the oven for me.

12:20.624 --> 12:22.592
- I'll be right back.
- Sure.

12:25.629 --> 12:28.064
Okay, what do you think of him?

12:28.132 --> 12:31.101
Do you have good feelings?
Because I definitely do not.

12:31.168 --> 12:33.603
- Why not? - Come on. I mean,
what 40-year-old doctor...

12:33.671 --> 12:36.573
- He's 40?
- 5 at best, but it's weird, right?

12:36.640 --> 12:39.642
Not to mention he's got
time in the middle of the day

12:39.710 --> 12:42.545
- to make quiche and playlists?
- Well, he said he was going back to the lab.

12:42.613 --> 12:44.481
He's got my mother
under some kind of spell,

12:44.548 --> 12:46.249
like Prince Eric and the sea witch.

12:46.317 --> 12:49.719
Oh, "the little mermaid."
God, I love that movie.

12:49.787 --> 12:51.855
I can't wait to watch that with my
kid. Does that mean I want a girl?

12:51.922 --> 12:54.891
Oh, how did you go with your sperm test?

12:54.959 --> 12:56.793
- Mine won.
- Oh, yay.

12:56.861 --> 12:58.728
How's Kevin? Is he mad?

12:58.796 --> 13:02.399
How'd you guess? Although it's
not like his sperm are useless.

13:02.466 --> 13:05.535
- I mean, they swim.
- Well, you know how competitive he is.

13:05.603 --> 13:08.505
Okay, let's take a look at those menus.

13:08.572 --> 13:10.106
Wait. W... what's this?

13:10.174 --> 13:12.842
I'm just... I'm
googling the good doctor.

13:12.910 --> 13:16.146
- Why?
- Because I don't trust him. It's all too good to be true.

13:16.213 --> 13:18.181
I don't think he's that bad.

13:18.249 --> 13:21.151
I mean, he... he's really
nice to your mom, right?

13:21.218 --> 13:22.452
Bingo.

13:22.520 --> 13:24.988
Simon Craig, M.D.

13:26.590 --> 13:28.324
Malpractice?

13:28.392 --> 13:30.260
I'm sure he's just an expert witness.

13:30.327 --> 13:32.762
No, defendant in both.

13:32.830 --> 13:36.132
Looks like they were
both for negligence.

13:41.049 --> 13:43.350
Nora!

13:43.418 --> 13:43.861
Holly.

13:43.861 --> 13:46.393
Hi. I... I rang the bell.

13:46.393 --> 13:48.714
- What?
- I... I rang the bell.

13:48.714 --> 13:49.903
The... the door was open.

13:49.903 --> 13:52.995
Oh. You know, our meeting is
not for another couple of hours.

13:52.995 --> 13:54.811
Yeah, I need to talk with you.

13:54.811 --> 13:58.299
Oh, okay. Well, the house
is really a mess. I've got...

13:58.299 --> 13:59.658
No, no, no, this won't take very long.

13:59.658 --> 14:05.667
I'm in a... bit of a...

14:05.667 --> 14:09.009
a financial situation.

14:09.077 --> 14:11.812
Oh. Is this about what
happened to the new wine?

14:11.880 --> 14:13.814
Well, that certainly didn't help,

14:13.882 --> 14:18.352
but, um, I invested a
lot of money in a fund...

14:18.419 --> 14:20.921
and they lost everything.

14:22.523 --> 14:24.124
Oh, my God.

14:24.192 --> 14:25.692
- Obviously...
- Please.

14:25.760 --> 14:29.096
I... I'm not the only person
that this has happened to. So...

14:29.163 --> 14:32.165
No. I mean, open the
papers, it's everywhere.

14:32.233 --> 14:35.068
Exactly. A... and I'm sure that
I'm gonna figure this all out,

14:35.136 --> 14:38.038
but in the meantime,
we have this wedding,

14:38.106 --> 14:41.041
and, um... well, all the plans

14:41.109 --> 14:44.144
were made for the wedding
before this happened.

14:44.212 --> 14:46.513
So...

14:48.283 --> 14:50.317
Oh, you... you want me... you want me...

14:50.385 --> 14:52.986
Yeah, well, I will pay
you back, obviously,

14:53.054 --> 14:55.656
- every single penny.
- Oh, of course. Absolutely. Of course. Of course.

14:55.723 --> 14:57.858
So how much do you need?

14:57.926 --> 14:59.459
So you will...

14:59.527 --> 15:02.663
Well, yeah. Hey, we're... we're family.

15:02.730 --> 15:05.599
Oh, thank you.

15:05.667 --> 15:06.967
So, um...

15:07.035 --> 15:08.535
so besides the hotel...

15:08.603 --> 15:10.470
Well, there's the hotel and the band...

15:10.538 --> 15:11.905
and the band...

15:11.973 --> 15:13.941
and the ukulele players...

15:14.008 --> 15:16.576
The ukulele players?

15:16.644 --> 15:20.480
Um... They're going to
play for cocktail hour.

15:20.548 --> 15:22.416
No string quartet?

15:22.483 --> 15:26.386
N... Nora, the entire wedding
has already been planned.

15:26.454 --> 15:29.156
Fine, fine. Maybe they
can just play a quick set

15:29.223 --> 15:30.791
during the reception...

15:30.858 --> 15:31.572
and then let the other guys play.

15:31.572 --> 15:33.961
Nora, this is what you did
at the engagement party.

15:33.961 --> 15:34.714
What?

15:34.714 --> 15:35.357
And I really don't wanto get
into any of this right now.

15:35.357 --> 15:36.080
What, what, what?

15:36.080 --> 15:39.259
I let you host at my house.
I gave you my home. What are...

15:39.259 --> 15:41.683
Yeah, and you rolled your
eyes at every choice I made.

15:41.683 --> 15:43.239
- No, I did not roll my...
- Holly, that...

15:43.239 --> 15:44.592
you went into a panic
when I tried to move

15:44.592 --> 15:45.611
your dining room table.

15:45.611 --> 15:46.853
Well, you were gonna scratch the floor.

15:46.853 --> 15:48.472
You put my table in the garage, Holly.

15:48.472 --> 15:48.953
You know, this is a loan...

15:48.953 --> 15:51.867
- that is completely...  a loan, a loan...
- And I am going to pay you back.

15:51.867 --> 15:53.156
- Fine. Yes.
- I am the mother of the bride.

15:53.156 --> 15:55.126
- You are the mother of the groom...
- Fine.

15:55.126 --> 15:57.500
And your responsibilities are
flowers, liquor, photographers,

15:57.500 --> 15:59.767
- that's it.
- Fine. Fine.

15:59.767 --> 16:03.047
- Okay. God.
- Who shall I make the check out to?

16:03.047 --> 16:06.059
You know what?

16:06.127 --> 16:07.694
Forget it.

16:07.762 --> 16:09.262
Holly.

16:09.330 --> 16:12.265
Do you have any idea
how hard it was for me

16:12.333 --> 16:15.335
- to come here and ask you for help?
- I said yes.

16:15.403 --> 16:18.005
Yeah, with that many
string quartets attached,

16:18.072 --> 16:20.173
That is not a yes.

16:20.241 --> 16:20.890
Well, what's gonna
happen to the wedding?

16:20.890 --> 16:22.679
Are you even gonna come
to this meeting tonight?

16:22.679 --> 16:25.310
Themeeting is about
my daughter's wedding.

16:25.310 --> 16:26.480
Of course I'm gonna come.

16:26.480 --> 16:30.592
But this conversation between
the two of us never happened.

16:30.592 --> 16:34.554
Wh...

16:34.622 --> 16:37.157
Rebecca.

16:37.158 --> 16:38.692
Rebecca.

16:38.760 --> 16:41.661
Hi. I'll be right out,
but, um, check the table.

16:41.729 --> 16:44.931
There's something
from your school there.

16:58.579 --> 17:00.414
- Hey.
- Hey.

17:00.481 --> 17:02.015
Those your midterm grades?

17:02.083 --> 17:03.350
Yeah.

17:03.418 --> 17:04.751
So how'd you do?

17:04.751 --> 17:08.029
- I did great. I did great. Better than I expected.
- Great.

17:08.029 --> 17:10.924
Yeah. Um, you know, I... I'm so sorry.

17:10.992 --> 17:13.127
I completely forgot that I
have an errand that I gotta run

17:13.127 --> 17:15.358
- before I go to...
- Oh, yeah, that's right. You're going out with the boys.

17:15.358 --> 17:16.948
Yeah, going out with the boys.

17:16.948 --> 17:22.403
Hey, um, I was thinking, maybe, uh...

17:22.403 --> 17:26.606
maybe before we go to our
things tonight, we could talk.

17:26.674 --> 17:28.175
Yeah. Uh, uh, absolutely.

17:28.242 --> 17:30.477
Just, um, you know,
maybe... maybe not now.

17:30.478 --> 17:32.312
Okay, yeah. No. Yeah.
Um, well, I was just,

17:32.380 --> 17:33.914
you know, thinking,

17:33.981 --> 17:35.916
because of everything
that's been going on,

17:35.983 --> 17:37.717
we haven't really had a chance to,

17:37.785 --> 17:40.153
you know, really... catch up.

17:40.221 --> 17:42.355
I totally agree. I think we should talk.

17:42.423 --> 17:42.889
But, uh, you know,
maybe...  maybe later.

17:42.889 --> 17:44.541
Okay, yeah. No, you just got good news.

17:44.541 --> 17:48.662
- You should go celebrate. Go, go, go, have fun.
- Okay.

17:53.167 --> 17:54.835
Hey. Anyone here yet?

17:54.902 --> 17:56.269
No, thank God.

17:56.337 --> 17:57.737
Where's Simon?

17:57.805 --> 18:00.373
He's in the shower.

18:00.441 --> 18:03.276
- Oh, my God. How many showers does that guy take?
- Shut up.

18:03.344 --> 18:05.912
- What are you doing?
- I need to talk to you.

18:05.980 --> 18:08.582
What? Listen, listen.
Holly came by earlier.

18:08.649 --> 18:10.215
And she told me the most shocking news.

18:10.215 --> 18:11.745
I don't know what to do.
I think the whole wedding

18:11.745 --> 18:14.072
- might be in jeopardy.
- Oh, my God, mom. I already know.

18:14.072 --> 18:18.024
You do? Who told you?

18:18.092 --> 18:19.559
Oh.

18:19.627 --> 18:21.895
Rebecca.

18:20.603 --> 18:22.375
Rebecca?

18:22.375 --> 18:23.152
Well, how long has she known?

18:23.152 --> 18:24.544
I don't know. I guess a couple of weeks.

18:24.545 --> 18:28.519
A few weeks? Holly
thinks no one else knows.

18:28.519 --> 18:28.786
Well, they don't. I'm
the only one who knows.

18:28.787 --> 18:31.571
Oh, is Rebecca terribly upset?

18:31.639 --> 18:34.541
Mom, she... she's a basket case.

18:34.609 --> 18:35.746
She... she doesn't even
know if she wants it.

18:35.746 --> 18:38.861
- Wants what?
- The baby. And she's not even gonna tell Justin

18:38.861 --> 18:40.735
- until she figures it all out.
- What baby?

18:43.001 --> 18:44.420
What baby?

18:45.119 --> 18:46.943
Oh. Oh, my God.

18:46.943 --> 18:51.126
No. N... no. Oh, we're not
having the same... conversation.

18:51.126 --> 18:52.517
- Kitty...
- Huh?

18:52.517 --> 18:53.899
- What baby?
- Mom, no. I... I... I...

18:53.899 --> 18:56.015
- Kitty...
- No... no baby. I...

18:56.015 --> 18:57.900
Look at me and start talking. What baby?

18:57.900 --> 19:02.979
Justin, you have come so far so fast.

19:02.979 --> 19:04.375
You remember a year and a half ago?

19:04.375 --> 19:06.169
You were living with your mother.

19:06.169 --> 19:07.233
Oh, don't worry. He'll be back.

19:07.233 --> 19:10.471
Oh, come on. No, it's
not funny. It's my toast.

19:10.471 --> 19:13.363
- Sorry. Sorry.
- And now you're about to become a doctor.

19:13.363 --> 19:16.109
Can't tell you how proud
that makes an uncle.

19:16.109 --> 19:18.525
You deserve all the happiness
that's coming to you.

19:18.525 --> 19:22.606
You have a grand and
glorious future ahead of you.

19:22.606 --> 19:25.054
- Congratulations. -
To Justin. - To Justin.

19:25.054 --> 19:26.233
To Justin. Cheers.

19:27.354 --> 19:30.029
Now, guys, come on.
Nobody wants one of these?

19:30.029 --> 19:32.165
- They're Cubans.
- You know what? I think I'll try one.

19:32.165 --> 19:34.780
Yeah, I like it, Wwandell.

19:34.780 --> 19:38.914
- Wow. One good sperm count, he thinks he's Mark Twain.
- Mark Twain?

19:38.914 --> 19:41.315
How you doing over there, Justin?

19:41.315 --> 19:44.716
- Good. Yeah.
- Take a good look around,

19:44.716 --> 19:47.252
because I may have thrown you
the gayest bachelor party ever.

19:47.252 --> 19:49.818
Oh, you know what they
used to call gay men

19:49.818 --> 19:51.407
- when I was a kid?
- What?

19:51.407 --> 19:53.690
Bachelors.

19:53.690 --> 19:57.366
- Uh-oh. That man needs a doctor.
Justin. - No, no, no, I'm not a doctor.

19:57.366 --> 19:59.807
- D... don't put it out. It's $40.
- I'm sorry. I c... can't.

19:59.807 --> 20:02.581
- I knew it. I knew he wouldn't be able to handle it.
- Oh, speaking of doctors,

20:02.581 --> 20:05.564
- Did you hear what Sarah found out about Simon?
- This should be interesting.

20:05.564 --> 20:07.557
Apparently, he has two pretty major

20:07.557 --> 20:09.015
malpractice lawsuits against him.

20:09.098 --> 20:11.128
Scotty, every doctor has a
malpractice suit against him.

20:11.128 --> 20:14.524
-That's... that's nothing. That's
Sarah being a baby. Speaking of which,

20:14.524 --> 20:15.754
have you and Rebecca thought about

20:15.754 --> 20:17.135
- when you want to start a family?
- Oh, no.

20:17.135 --> 20:18.286
What kind of a conversation is this?

20:18.286 --> 20:21.808
- This is a bachelor party, not "The View."
Drink up. What's wrong with "The View"?

20:21.808 --> 20:24.469
- I like "The View." it's one of the best shows on tv.
- I can't believe you guys.

20:24.469 --> 20:25.958
Can we please change the subject?

20:25.958 --> 20:26.571
What?

20:26.571 --> 20:31.048
Wait. What's that?

20:31.048 --> 20:33.571
- What's what?
- What's in your glass?

20:33.571 --> 20:36.529
What do you mean, what's in my glass?

20:36.597 --> 20:37.995
- This is champagne.
- So what?

20:37.995 --> 20:41.792
- So what? You're a recovering addict.
- Yeah, an addict, not an alcoholic, Kevin.

20:41.792 --> 20:43.841
- I'm not addicted to champagne.
- Oh, please. Like there's a difference?

20:43.841 --> 20:46.337
- Kevin, it's a glass of champagne. Relax.
- I know. You're not allowed to have this.

20:46.337 --> 20:47.900
It's at my bachelor
party. I think I can have

20:47.900 --> 20:50.152
- A glass of champagne if I want to.
- No, I'm sorry, you can't, not in front of me.

20:50.152 --> 20:51.481
- Are you serious?
- Yes, I'm serious.

20:51.481 --> 20:53.510
- Guys, sit down.
- What the hell is wrong with you right now?

20:53.510 --> 20:54.789
Kevin, you know what? You
have no idea what's the matter

20:54.789 --> 20:55.728
with me right now.

21:07.293 --> 21:08.706
Ooh, that's nice.

21:09.995 --> 21:10.661
You know, Rebecca,

21:10.598 --> 21:12.966
you totally have
that bride-to-be glow.

21:13.034 --> 21:14.314
No, she doesn't. She's not glowing.

21:14.314 --> 21:15.277
No, I don't see a glow.

21:15.312 --> 21:16.808
Nora, she looks beautiful.

21:17.038 --> 21:17.991
Well, yes, she looks beautiful.

21:17.991 --> 21:20.173
- But she... she's not glowing.
- But I don't think she's glowing.

21:20.241 --> 21:23.009
Okay, can we just stop
talking about my looks, please?

21:23.077 --> 21:25.779
Sweetie, you haven't
even touched your wine.

21:25.847 --> 21:29.382
- I'm not thirsty.
- Since when did you need to be thirsty to drink wine?

21:29.450 --> 21:32.352
You know what? Don't drink it.

21:32.420 --> 21:34.788
- You need a designated driver.
- Ah, absolutely.

21:34.856 --> 21:37.624
Rebecca, I could use
a ride later, actually.

21:37.692 --> 21:39.993
Okay, um, I say that we
focus on the big wedding.

21:40.061 --> 21:42.295
Okay, Holly? Oh, you
know what we could do?

21:42.363 --> 21:43.426
We could talk about the honeymoon.

21:43.426 --> 21:45.924
No. No, we're here to
talk about the wedding.

21:45.924 --> 21:49.452
So let's talk about the
big Hawaiian extravaganza.

21:49.452 --> 21:51.630
Okay. Well, you know,
it doesn't have to be

21:51.630 --> 21:53.162
an extravaganza or anything.

21:53.162 --> 22:02.027
I'm good. I'm good.

22:02.083 --> 22:04.887
Well, c... could you stop starin at me?

22:04.887 --> 22:06.067
Sorry.

22:12.733 --> 22:13.615
- Is it Justin?
- No.

22:13.615 --> 22:15.660
- No, it's not Justin.
- I'm sorry. I'm just...

22:15.660 --> 22:17.221
Okay, okay.

22:17.221 --> 22:19.479
Excuse me.

22:20.601 --> 22:23.303
- Whoa.
- Oh, here. I'll take that. Thank you.

22:23.371 --> 22:26.940
- I hope it's not the quiche.
- No.

22:27.008 --> 22:29.714
- Do you think he's been drinking for a while?
- No, I think we would know if he was.

22:29.714 --> 22:32.445
- Yeah, hiding it was never his forte.
- Yeah, talk about cold feet.

22:32.445 --> 22:34.699
- I think they're frostbitten.
- Oh, that poor kid.

22:34.699 --> 22:36.543
He's gonna be dealing with
more than you can imagine.

22:36.543 --> 22:39.047
Well, I don't find
marriage that rough. Do you?

22:39.047 --> 22:41.145
I'm not talking about marriage.

22:41.145 --> 22:43.573
Well, Robert, what
are you talking about?

22:43.573 --> 22:46.586
Do you know something?

22:46.586 --> 22:49.787
All right, look, the only reason

22:49.787 --> 22:51.898
I'm telling you this is because
I'm really worried about him.

22:51.966 --> 22:53.900
And you're gonna find out anyway.

22:53.968 --> 22:56.636
I just... I think you
should be prepared.

22:56.704 --> 23:01.041
Ah! A doctor who makes
playlists and cleans.

23:01.108 --> 23:03.410
You're almost too good to be true.

23:03.477 --> 23:05.011
I actually hate to clean.

23:05.079 --> 23:07.113
It was better than being out there.

23:07.181 --> 23:08.815
Why is that?

23:08.883 --> 23:12.085
Well, it just... seemed
a little tense in there.

23:12.153 --> 23:15.922
Mm. Well, I would've thought
you being a cancer doctor,

23:15.990 --> 23:17.991
you'd be used to tension.

23:18.059 --> 23:19.926
Well, I deal mostly with cells.

23:19.994 --> 23:22.229
They multiply, but they don't get tense.

23:22.296 --> 23:23.663
That's funny.

23:23.731 --> 23:25.632
You're funny.

23:25.700 --> 23:28.969
You do have flaws, though, right?

23:30.938 --> 23:32.105
No.

23:32.173 --> 23:34.074
I'm perfect.

23:34.141 --> 23:37.210
Hmm.

23:37.278 --> 23:40.213
What's going on, Sarah?

23:40.281 --> 23:42.582
Why are we having this conversation?

23:42.650 --> 23:44.918
Oh, I'm just getting to know you.

23:44.986 --> 23:46.219
Hmm.

23:46.287 --> 23:50.190
Well, I hate to clean.
I like greasy foods.

23:50.258 --> 23:53.393
Not the most punctual
person in the world.

23:53.461 --> 23:55.061
Does that help?

23:55.129 --> 23:56.997
A little bit.

23:57.064 --> 23:59.099
I appreciate you being
protective of your mom.

23:59.166 --> 24:00.967
But you have nothing to worry about.

24:01.035 --> 24:03.303
You do have to admit
that you and my mother

24:03.371 --> 24:05.405
have kind of gone from...

24:05.473 --> 24:09.209
- What are you doing?
- Oh, we're just chatting.

24:09.277 --> 24:10.977
Really?

24:11.045 --> 24:13.580
Ah, well, you've been
at the sink all night.

24:13.648 --> 24:16.583
- Come with me. Why don't we let Sarah finish the dishes?
- Nora, it's fine.

24:16.651 --> 24:19.552
No, you deserve a break. Come on.

24:28.062 --> 24:31.054
Oh... Go away.

24:31.054 --> 24:33.840
I'm not going anywhere.

24:33.840 --> 24:37.249
I'm such an idiot.

24:37.249 --> 24:41.149
Having one drink doesn't
make you an idiot, Justin.

24:41.149 --> 24:43.775
It makes you human.

24:43.775 --> 24:46.146
- I'm not gonna be a doctor.
- What are you talking about?

24:46.213 --> 24:48.848
- You see, Uncle Saul, I'm failing.
- What?

24:48.916 --> 24:51.685
- I got my grades today, and I'm back on academic probation.
- I'm sorry.

24:51.752 --> 24:54.287
All that work I've done, so
many frickin' hours I put in,

24:54.355 --> 24:56.189
I have to start all over again.

24:56.257 --> 24:58.158
Oh, I'm sorry, Justin.

24:58.225 --> 25:00.093
And, you know, I couldn't
even tell Rebecca.

25:00.161 --> 25:03.063
She was standing right in
front of me when I found out,

25:03.130 --> 25:04.124
and you know what I did? I took off.

25:04.124 --> 25:08.721
Do you know how
disappointed I am in myself?

25:08.721 --> 25:10.131
- Whoa, whoa, hold it.
- Hang on. Just... just...

25:10.131 --> 25:13.151
- What?
- Just listen to me. You're about to get married, Justin.

25:13.151 --> 25:14.680
You have your whole life ahead of you.

25:14.680 --> 25:16.568
You just have to remember one thing.

25:16.568 --> 25:18.102
Remember how strong you are every day,

25:18.102 --> 25:19.820
because it never stops.

25:29.090 --> 25:31.591
I miss Rebecca.

25:34.528 --> 25:36.903
I miss what we used to be.

25:36.903 --> 25:38.365
I mean, I feel like
we've gotten caught up

25:38.432 --> 25:40.400
in all this wedding stuff,

25:40.468 --> 25:43.436
And... I've lost my best friend.

25:43.504 --> 25:46.039
She hasn't gone anyplace.

25:46.107 --> 25:49.476
She's right there, Justin.

25:49.543 --> 25:52.545
You know, they're
having some wedding thing

25:52.613 --> 25:54.547
at my mom's house tonight.

25:54.615 --> 25:57.684
- I think I should go talk to her.
- Yeah, you should.

25:59.920 --> 26:02.589
The dishes are done.

26:02.656 --> 26:04.190
Pots, too?

26:04.258 --> 26:06.726
Come on, mom. I was
just making conversation.

26:06.794 --> 26:08.328
Bull crap, Sarah.

26:08.396 --> 26:10.797
You were rude. You
were interrogating him.

26:10.865 --> 26:13.366
But it's like you're in a trance.

26:13.434 --> 26:15.368
It's not just me that thinks so.

26:15.436 --> 26:18.405
- Kitty does, too.
- The two of you have been discussing this?

26:18.472 --> 26:21.307
Well, mom, coming into the
house lately, it... it... look.

26:21.375 --> 26:23.276
It feels like an... an altered universe.

26:23.344 --> 26:25.845
Well, I like the alteration. I'm happy.

26:25.913 --> 26:28.081
I've been a little lax
with the housework. So what?

26:28.149 --> 26:30.116
Don't take it out on Simon.

26:30.184 --> 26:33.486
Listen to me. Fyi...
your Simon Craig, M.D.,

26:33.554 --> 26:37.157
has two malpractice suits against him.

26:37.224 --> 26:40.660
The first, failure...
to follow up a biopsy.

26:40.728 --> 26:44.097
- The second was...
- And the second is delayed treatment, right?

26:44.165 --> 26:46.099
You know this already?

26:46.167 --> 26:48.468
Yes. You want to know what else I know?

26:48.536 --> 26:50.603
Both cases... thrown
out. Insufficient grounds.

26:50.671 --> 26:52.439
He didn't do anything wrong.

26:52.506 --> 26:54.007
All doctors get sued.

26:54.075 --> 26:55.575
But you can't believe

26:55.643 --> 26:57.577
that someone that young and attractive

26:57.645 --> 27:00.480
- can be a good guy and still want to be with your mother.
- Oh, don't...

27:00.548 --> 27:03.983
He's a good person Sarah. Why
can't you just be happy for me?

27:04.051 --> 27:06.052
- Look, I want to, mom. I really do.
- Sarah, Sarah...

27:06.120 --> 27:08.521
- But there's something cr...
- Listen to me now.

27:08.589 --> 27:10.723
I am really, really
sorry that Luc left you.

27:10.791 --> 27:12.692
If I could bring him
back to you, I would.

27:12.760 --> 27:14.761
But honestly, I think it's unfair of you

27:14.829 --> 27:16.763
- to take your broken heart out on me.
- What?

27:16.831 --> 27:18.565
- Yeah. Oh...
- What?!

27:18.632 --> 27:21.434
I just... I just wanted
to let you know we're here.

27:21.502 --> 27:24.938
- What happened to your big boys night out?
- Ugh. Wine first.

27:25.005 --> 27:27.740
Uh, did Justin find out anything?

27:27.808 --> 27:30.110
No, but we all did.

27:30.177 --> 27:31.111
What?

27:38.385 --> 27:40.353
Look, I... I... I need
to tell you something,

27:40.421 --> 27:42.188
but I... I don't want you to get scared.

27:42.256 --> 27:43.756
Well, now I am scared.

27:43.824 --> 27:46.259
I mean... What's going
on? Did you talk to Kitty?

27:46.327 --> 27:48.194
No, no, no. I didn't tell Kitty.

27:48.262 --> 27:49.662
Um...

27:53.634 --> 27:56.569
I had a drink at my bachelor party.

27:56.637 --> 27:59.038
- Oh, my God, Justin.
- I'm so... I'm so sorry.

27:59.106 --> 28:00.881
No, what were you thinking?

28:00.881 --> 28:03.186
I wasn't thinking, which
is exactly why it happened.

28:03.186 --> 28:05.045
- Yeah, but you can't be drinking.
- I understand that. I...

28:05.045 --> 28:06.724
Rebecca, I already called my sponsor.

28:06.724 --> 28:07.871
You know, Justin, we're about
to start a life together.

28:07.871 --> 28:09.522
I... I know, which is why
I feel like I should be able

28:09.522 --> 28:11.288
to tell you everything and
anything that is happening.

28:11.288 --> 28:12.483
- No, I... I... no, no.
- But right now...

28:12.483 --> 28:13.717
But, Rebecca, that's not
it. There's more, actually.

28:13.717 --> 28:15.450
- I have to tell you something...
- No, no, I can't. I can't deal with this right now.

28:15.450 --> 28:18.378
- I can't... I can't think about you falling apart right now.
- But I'm not falling apart.

28:18.378 --> 28:19.300
That's exactly what I'm telling you.

28:19.300 --> 28:20.094
Stin, you can't be doing
these things right now.

28:20.094 --> 28:20.941
I'm under so much pressure at school...

28:20.941 --> 28:21.626
Justin, you're gonna be a father.

28:26.133 --> 28:30.236
- What?
- I'm seven weeks pregnant.

28:30.304 --> 28:32.739
You're... you're seven weeks pregnant?

28:32.806 --> 28:35.775
I didn't know how to tell you
before I knew what I wanted.

28:35.843 --> 28:37.810
I mean, you don't want
a kid right now, Justin.

28:37.878 --> 28:40.780
You told me that. What if you
convinced me to do something

28:40.848 --> 28:43.349
- that I didn't want to do?
- Rebecca, what does that mean? I... I can't believe this.

28:43.417 --> 28:46.052
- Justin, please just try to understand.
- Under...

28:49.223 --> 28:53.393
D... d... does your
mother know about this?

28:53.460 --> 28:55.695
No.

28:55.763 --> 28:57.730
David does.

28:57.798 --> 28:59.132
You t... you told...

28:59.200 --> 29:00.700
Who else?

29:02.803 --> 29:05.071
Rebecca, who else did
you tell about this?

29:05.139 --> 29:06.673
- Kitty.
- Kitty?

29:06.740 --> 29:09.475
I had to talk to somebody.

29:09.543 --> 29:11.711
Not me?

29:11.779 --> 29:15.515
You don't... you don't... you
don't talk about this with me?

29:15.583 --> 29:18.184
I can't...

29:18.252 --> 29:20.620
I should go in there.

29:20.688 --> 29:22.388
No, no, Holly. Don't.

29:22.456 --> 29:25.558
Something is very wrong. I can tell.

29:39.740 --> 29:41.975
You all know, don't you?

29:42.042 --> 29:44.510
Know what?

29:46.580 --> 29:50.250
Your daughter is pregnant.

29:50.317 --> 29:53.519
What?

29:56.366 --> 29:58.592
Oh, he's still not answering.
I screwed this whole thing up.

29:58.592 --> 30:00.735
And God knows where Justin is.

30:00.735 --> 30:01.968
He's probably at a bar right now.

30:01.968 --> 30:03.772
Yeah, well, if he is,

30:03.772 --> 30:05.978
you probably don't want to marry him.

30:05.978 --> 30:08.781
Yes, I do.

30:08.781 --> 30:11.374
Of course I do. I love him. I
mean, why do you think it was

30:11.374 --> 30:12.779
so hard for me to tell
him in the first place?

30:12.779 --> 30:13.938
Why do you think it was
hard for me to tell you?

30:14.453 --> 30:16.487
I just wish we had the
kind of relationship

30:16.555 --> 30:18.523
- that you felt safe enough...
- Mom, you know that's not it.

30:18.590 --> 30:21.092
I know you felt safe talking
to David, which is great.

30:21.159 --> 30:23.528
- He's your father. You should feel safe...
- Mom, I love you and Justin

30:23.595 --> 30:25.930
more than anything else
in this entire world.

30:25.998 --> 30:27.965
That's why I couldn't tell you.

30:28.033 --> 30:30.568
I mean, the idea that
you might not approve?

30:30.636 --> 30:34.133
- What would make you think that I wouldn't approve?
- Because, mom...

30:34.133 --> 30:38.292
you have always told me
that you had me too young.

30:39.227 --> 30:40.542
Oh, honey.

30:40.542 --> 30:41.235
Well...

30:41.235 --> 30:43.305
That I had you at all

30:43.305 --> 30:46.313
is the greatest,

30:46.248 --> 30:49.289
most beautiful miracle of my life.

30:49.289 --> 30:52.844
And I wouldn't change one bit of it

30:52.844 --> 30:53.056
for anything.

30:53.124 --> 30:58.054
Whatever you decide, I am on your side.

30:58.054 --> 31:00.254
I am always on your side.

31:00.254 --> 31:03.066
All that matters...

31:03.101 --> 31:05.199
is what you want.

31:07.605 --> 31:10.499
Do you know what that is?

31:16.311 --> 31:18.479
Yeah, I do.

31:23.051 --> 31:26.420
I want to have the baby.

31:26.488 --> 31:29.724
I mean, I'm so scared, but...

31:29.792 --> 31:32.426
I want to have it.

31:32.494 --> 31:35.797
Then you need to tell Justin that.

31:37.969 --> 31:39.015
- Please, just...
- But you're upset...

31:39.015 --> 31:40.089
All right, please just go now, okay?

31:40.089 --> 31:43.466
I just... I... I will
call you at another time.

31:43.466 --> 31:45.277
Just not now.

31:51.814 --> 31:52.649
Everything okay?

31:52.649 --> 31:54.940
Fine. Just put those in the recycler.

31:54.940 --> 31:56.265
I'll take care of everything else.

31:56.265 --> 31:57.287
Sure.

31:58.834 --> 32:01.753
So what happened with Simon?

32:01.753 --> 32:04.280
Nothing. I just... I
just asked him to go home.

32:04.280 --> 32:07.849
- That's all.
- Really? 'Cause that seemed like a very big "go home."

32:07.849 --> 32:09.680
Look, Kitty, this is crazy.

32:09.680 --> 32:12.559
- There's just too much going on.
- Well, what do you mean? What's going on?

32:12.559 --> 32:15.875
Oh, yes, I know, Justin
and Rebecca, but, mom,

32:15.875 --> 32:17.572
that doesn't mean that you
can't go out with Simon.

32:17.572 --> 32:19.617
Not just that. It's
everything. It's everyone.

32:19.617 --> 32:22.974
- Mom, can I have a word?
- No, Sarah. She just broke up with Simon.

32:22.974 --> 32:25.468
No. Mom... I wanted to say,

32:25.468 --> 32:27.340
I'm sorry. You were right.

32:27.340 --> 32:29.886
I was just looking for
something to be wrong with Simon

32:29.886 --> 32:32.615
because of my own crappy
romantic situation.

32:32.615 --> 32:34.176
Yeah, and you know what, mom?

32:34.176 --> 32:35.338
I was acting like a teenager,

32:35.338 --> 32:36.974
and I was teasing you about the milk.

32:36.974 --> 32:40.668
- And I was just googling him to distract myself.
- You googled him?

32:40.668 --> 32:42.752
- I'm disgusting.
- Say it, Kitty.

32:42.752 --> 32:45.131
- You're disgusting.
- No, she's not disgusting.

32:45.131 --> 32:46.382
- No, she is.
- She is not.

32:46.382 --> 32:48.662
- No, she googled him.
- She was trying to protect me, and I appreciate it.

32:48.662 --> 32:51.087
Mom, he's a good guy. He's into you.

32:51.087 --> 32:54.761
- You don't need protecting.
- Yeah. Mom, you... mom, stop.

32:54.761 --> 32:58.761
- He makes you happy.
- I've got plenty of other things to make me happy.

32:58.761 --> 33:00.361
Like what? Like us? Like what?

33:00.361 --> 33:04.118
- You deserve to have fun.
- I did have fun. I got on his motorcycle for a while.

33:04.118 --> 33:06.516
- I had fun.
- Okay, well, then don't get off.

33:06.516 --> 33:09.940
Lead by example. You know
what would make me happy, mom?

33:09.940 --> 33:11.798
To see you in a good relationship.

33:11.798 --> 33:14.606
And seeing you in the shower
this morning with Simon...

33:14.606 --> 33:16.645
and... and I'm not saying that
I want a repeat performance.

33:16.645 --> 33:20.611
- I'm just saying that it made me happy.
- Take it from me, mom. Don't let this guy go.

33:20.611 --> 33:23.339
- Yeah.
- You were doing something that was feeling good.

33:23.339 --> 33:24.934
So go with it.

33:24.934 --> 33:26.384
Yeah, yeah. You know what?

33:26.384 --> 33:29.217
You have to at least give it a try.

33:29.217 --> 33:30.252
You have to.

33:30.252 --> 33:31.231
Yeah.

33:31.231 --> 33:34.131
Okay, I'll give it a try.

33:34.131 --> 33:35.946
Good. Good, good, good.

33:35.946 --> 33:38.186
Mm.

33:43.125 --> 33:44.659
Hey.

33:44.727 --> 33:46.693
I guess this wasn't such a good idea.

33:46.693 --> 33:48.325
When was she gonna tell me, huh?

33:48.325 --> 33:50.164
Somewhere between "I do"

33:50.164 --> 33:51.360
And "you may now kiss the bride?"

33:51.360 --> 33:54.966
- I get it. You're pissed.
- Yeah, I'm pissed.

33:54.966 --> 33:58.349
- She basically lied to me for weeks, Robert.
- I got news for you. People lie.

33:58.349 --> 34:02.168
They lie in marriages.
They lie in relationships.

34:02.168 --> 34:04.921
And sometimes it's
hurtful and sometimes...

34:04.921 --> 34:06.552
Yeah, sometimes what?

34:06.552 --> 34:10.489
It's how you get through the day.

34:10.489 --> 34:12.170
You know, that's a dangerous
thing to say to an addict.

34:12.170 --> 34:13.056
Yeah.

34:14.003 --> 34:16.313
No, an addict lies to protect himself.

34:16.313 --> 34:19.007
I'm not... I'm not saying that.

34:22.826 --> 34:23.911
When I saw Kitty...

34:24.356 --> 34:27.951
with her shaved head, I
told her she looked great,

34:28.637 --> 34:29.938
That she was beautiful.

34:30.773 --> 34:33.141
But the truth is, when I looked at her,

34:33.208 --> 34:37.110
all I could see is that she might die.

34:37.179 --> 34:37.927
And so I lied,

34:37.927 --> 34:42.116
because it's what we do...

34:42.184 --> 34:44.695
to protect and support
the people that we love.

34:44.695 --> 34:48.889
- Rebecca's not trying to protect me, Robert.
- Maybe she's trying to protect the relationship.

34:48.958 --> 34:50.404
I mean, she knows you've
been immersed in med school.

34:50.404 --> 34:51.947
She knows how important that is to you.

34:51.947 --> 34:52.577
I mean, look,

34:52.577 --> 34:54.000
there are a million
reasons why people lie.

34:54.000 --> 34:56.476
All I am saying is that now you know.

34:56.476 --> 34:58.832
However it went down, you know.

34:58.832 --> 35:01.683
So it seems to me you
should be thinking about

35:01.683 --> 35:03.618
whether or not you want to be a dad.

35:03.618 --> 35:05.488
Oh, God. Trust me. That's
all I'm thinking about.

35:11.280 --> 35:13.181
Well, let me ask you a question.

35:13.249 --> 35:15.350
Um...

35:15.417 --> 35:17.352
Do you think it's an appropriate lie

35:17.419 --> 35:21.256
to say you're happy to
have a baby when you're not?

35:23.792 --> 35:26.594
That's something you're gonna
have to decide for yourself.

35:41.384 --> 35:42.951
You're here.

35:43.019 --> 35:45.587
Where else would I be?

35:45.655 --> 35:48.924
I don't know. I kinda
thought that maybe...

35:48.991 --> 35:51.660
I'd come home, and you'd
have your bags packed.

35:51.728 --> 35:54.296
I'm not going anywhere, Rebecca.

35:57.433 --> 35:59.534
I'm so sorry.

35:59.602 --> 36:03.672
I know that I should've told you.

36:03.740 --> 36:05.607
You can be mad at me.

36:05.675 --> 36:08.677
Rebecca, I'm not mad at you.

36:08.745 --> 36:11.046
I'm just...

36:11.114 --> 36:13.815
I feel completely overwhelmed.

36:13.883 --> 36:15.851
I know. I know.

36:15.918 --> 36:18.086
It's a lot.

36:18.154 --> 36:20.589
We're getting married...

36:23.659 --> 36:27.062
A baby.

36:27.130 --> 36:29.931
So that's what you want?

36:29.999 --> 36:32.033
You want the baby?

36:33.836 --> 36:36.972
Justin, when I was...

36:37.039 --> 36:39.307
a little girl,

36:39.375 --> 36:42.344
all I wanted was a family.

36:42.412 --> 36:45.247
I mean, like a mom and
a dad who held hands

36:45.314 --> 36:48.617
and did all of that stuff, you know?

36:48.684 --> 36:52.020
I didn't have that.

36:52.088 --> 36:54.689
But this baby could, you know?

36:54.757 --> 36:58.093
We might be young and crazy...

36:58.161 --> 37:00.896
but we love each other.

37:03.966 --> 37:05.499
That's all we need,
right? Am I... am I insane?

37:05.499 --> 37:08.680
No, no, you're not.

37:08.849 --> 37:14.443
What do you want?

37:16.479 --> 37:18.613
I want us to be happy.

37:21.884 --> 37:24.152
What about the baby?

37:27.390 --> 37:29.591
Yeah.

37:29.659 --> 37:31.827
I want that, too.

37:34.030 --> 37:34.198
You do?

37:34.198 --> 37:35.154
Yeah, I do.

37:36.883 --> 37:38.067
You're gonna be an amazing dad...

37:40.637 --> 37:42.171
and doctor.

37:42.238 --> 37:44.106
All right, come here.

37:44.174 --> 37:45.607
Doctor dad.

37:45.675 --> 37:47.042
Come here.

37:47.110 --> 37:49.745
Oh, it's gonna be okay.

37:52.815 --> 37:55.284
Everything's gonna be okay.

38:00.023 --> 38:01.164
Greetings from
the mother-in-law.

38:01.164 --> 38:02.673
Nora, what are you doing here?

38:02.673 --> 38:06.094
I told you that I
would come and see you.

38:06.094 --> 38:07.850
Yeah, I know, but I thought
about it, and it's ridiculous.

38:07.850 --> 38:10.855
You work and I don't, and
like I said on the phone,

38:10.855 --> 38:12.725
Holly, I'm happy to be able to do this.

38:12.725 --> 38:14.313
I haven't worked out the schedule yet,

38:14.313 --> 38:18.050
- but I will pay you back with interest.
- I don't want interest.

38:18.050 --> 38:19.983
You know, Nora, please don't do
this. It's hard enough as it is.

38:19.983 --> 38:24.810
- I don't need you to add pity to the mix.
- I don't pity you.

38:24.810 --> 38:28.907
God, you take risks... 
Ojai Foods, Walker Landing...

38:28.907 --> 38:32.472
Mm-hmm, and yeah, with
risks, you fall... far.

38:32.472 --> 38:34.241
Well, that may be, but
I'm not worried about you.

38:34.241 --> 38:40.752
And trust me, Holly, no
one will know about this,

38:40.752 --> 38:41.498
not ever.

38:41.498 --> 38:45.282
We're gonna have to
learn to trust each other.

38:45.282 --> 38:49.555
Even about ukuleles?

38:49.555 --> 38:53.019
Oh, I thought about it,
and ukuleles are fine.

38:53.019 --> 38:55.147
I like ukuleles.

38:55.147 --> 38:57.360
Okay.

38:57.360 --> 38:58.827
Uh, Nora.

38:58.827 --> 39:04.046
Do you know what I'm
really nervous about?

39:04.046 --> 39:04.810
What?

39:04.810 --> 39:07.524
This whole grandmother thing.

39:07.524 --> 39:11.168
Oh, my God. I forgot.
This is your first one.

39:11.168 --> 39:12.089
Mm-hmm.

39:13.440 --> 39:15.705
It sounds so old.

39:21.404 --> 39:23.389
What are you doing here
in the middle of the day?

39:23.389 --> 39:26.101
Everybody needs to stop
worrying about my broken heart.

39:26.101 --> 39:27.530
I'm working. I'm fine.

39:28.127 --> 39:28.965
Yeah, that's not why I'm here.

39:28.965 --> 39:31.988
If you're here to talk about
last night's insanity, don't.

39:31.988 --> 39:32.843
Oh, by the way,

39:32.843 --> 39:35.394
I'm glad Scotty's
sperm's better than yours.

39:35.394 --> 39:37.765
Us Walkers need to stop reproducing.

39:37.765 --> 39:39.267
Yeah, well, I'm actually
here to talk about mom.

39:39.267 --> 39:40.914
You know, I think she's in love.

39:40.979 --> 39:42.228
I know. That's what I'm afraid of.

39:42.228 --> 39:44.527
Oh, Scotty told you about
the malpractice suits?

39:44.527 --> 39:46.471
Don't worry about it.
Apparently they were both

39:46.471 --> 39:47.571
thrown out before they went to court,

39:47.571 --> 39:49.050
and mom knew about them anyway.

39:49.050 --> 39:50.570
Yeah, well, I did some googling myself.

39:50.571 --> 39:51.595
Did you notice the dates

39:51.595 --> 39:52.852
of when those lawsuits were thrown out?

39:52.852 --> 39:55.352
It was around the same time
he stopped seeing patients

39:55.352 --> 39:58.793
- and started research.
- What are you saying?

39:58.793 --> 40:00.746
I'm saying, I think he
got his license yanked.

40:00.746 --> 40:03.764
Oh, no. Kevin...

40:03.764 --> 40:05.614
Sarah, your intuition
about this kind of stuff

40:05.614 --> 40:06.697
is always dead on.

40:06.697 --> 40:09.002
So what if you're right about this guy?

40:09.002 --> 40:12.784
It's like a bad song I
just got out of my head,

40:12.784 --> 40:14.468
and you just pressed "play."

40:14.468 --> 40:16.043
Sorry.

40:19.362 --> 40:20.386
Okay, mom. I'm leaving.

40:20.386 --> 40:22.039
Is Robert picking you up?

40:22.039 --> 40:25.347
Ah, no. See, it's funny.

40:25.347 --> 40:26.941
They... they don't
take away your license

40:26.941 --> 40:27.921
just because you have cancer.

40:27.921 --> 40:31.224
I would say come back soon,

40:31.224 --> 40:33.309
but I know you'll be back
for the next round of chemo.

40:33.309 --> 40:35.766
I'm not just coming back
because of the chemo.

40:35.766 --> 40:37.730
It's also the laundry.

40:37.730 --> 40:40.365
There he is.

40:41.417 --> 40:41.841
Coming.

40:42.552 --> 40:42.790
Well...

40:44.903 --> 40:47.484
Do I look all right?

40:47.519 --> 40:50.744
Motorcycles are very
dangerous. Have I lost my mind?

40:50.744 --> 40:52.650
Mom, get on the bike.

40:53.429 --> 40:54.087
Yeah.

40:58.234 --> 40:59.047
Hey.

40:59.047 --> 40:59.777
Hi.

41:00.803 --> 41:01.374
You ready?

41:05.174 --> 41:06.015
Hi, Kitty.

41:06.015 --> 41:06.695
Hi.

41:07.977 --> 41:08.839
Thought we'd head south this time.

41:08.839 --> 41:09.818
Manhattan Beach maybe?

41:09.818 --> 41:13.363
We're going south.
Manhattan Beach. Let's go.

41:14.050 --> 41:15.291
Mm.
