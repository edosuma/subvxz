IT'S ALL ABOUT SEX.

01:31.540 --> 01:33.380
IT'S TRUE.

01:33.410 --> 01:36.450
IN FACT, THEY SAY MEN THINK
ABOUT SEX EVERY 28 SECONDS.

01:36.480 --> 01:40.550
OF COURSE, THAT'S STRAIGHT MEN.
WITH GAY MEN IT'S EVERY 9.

WHY WE'RE ALL AT BABYLON

AT 1:00 IN THE MORNING
INSTEAD OF AT HOME IN BED.

01:57.200 --> 01:59.200
BUT WHO WANTS TO BE AT HOME
IN BED?

01:59.240 --> 02:01.640
ESPECIALLY ALONE,
WHEN YOU CAN BE HERE,

02:01.670 --> 02:05.440
KNOWING THAT AT ANY MOMENT
YOU MIGHT SEE "HIM,"

03:29.360 --> 03:30.860
THESE DAYS,
IT TAKES REAL GUTS

03:30.890 --> 03:32.860
TO BE A QUEEN IN A WORLD
FULL OF COMMONERS.

03:32.900 --> 03:34.530
- THE PROBLEM WITH PERFECTION

03:34.560 --> 03:35.930
IS ITS INABILITY
TO RECOGNIZE

03:35.970 --> 03:37.870
ANYTHING LESS PERFECT
THAN ITSELF.

03:37.900 --> 03:39.870
- IN OTHER WORDS,
YOU HIT ON HIM,

03:39.900 --> 03:41.910
AND HE TURNED YOU DOWN.

03:41.940 --> 03:43.810

SMART GUY,

03:45.640 --> 03:47.310

A REALLY BIG HEART.

03:47.340 --> 03:50.410
ONLY, NOBODY HERE IS INTERESTED
IN THE SIZE OF THAT ORGAN.

03:50.450 --> 03:51.420

YOU'RE HAVING IT.

YOU'RE BRIAN KINNEY.

A FUCK WHAT YOU THINK?

HE SAID HE'D BE RIGHT OUT.

05:43.490 --> 05:44.860
- YEAH, WE'VE ALL
HEARD THAT BEFORE.

05:44.890 --> 05:46.560
- THIS IS SOME GREAT SYSTEM
HE'S GOT.

05:46.600 --> 05:49.100
HE GETS TO PARTY ALL NIGHT
AND YOU DRIVE HIM HOME.

05:49.130 --> 05:51.000

- HONEY, IT'S WHAT
WE ALL NEED.

12:56.230 --> 12:58.900
HEY! WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
YOU GOT LAID?

12:58.930 --> 13:00.200
MY POINT EXACTLY.

13:00.230 --> 13:03.430
IF YOU CAN'T REMEMBER,
THEN IT'S TIME.

13:03.470 --> 13:05.030
NOW, WHERE ARE YOUR MANNERS?

13:05.070 --> 13:06.870
GO, UH, GO INVITE
THE GENTLEMAN IN

13:06.900 --> 13:08.910
WHILE I MAKE SURE
NONE OF MY FINE WASHABLES

13:08.940 --> 13:10.340
ARE HANGING IN THE TUB.

13:16.210 --> 13:20.380
[panting]

13:33.060 --> 13:36.100
[moaning]

13:36.130 --> 13:37.370

13:37.400 --> 13:40.440

13:40.470 --> 13:42.970
[groaning]

13:43.010 --> 13:45.070
STOP.

13:45.110 --> 13:50.410
[panting]

13:50.450 --> 13:52.180

13:52.220 --> 13:54.320

13:54.350 --> 13:56.290
I DON'T KNOW.

13:56.320 --> 13:59.320
WATCH TV, PLAY TOMB RAIDER.

13:59.360 --> 14:02.090
- [chuckles]
I MEAN IN BED.

14:02.130 --> 14:03.430
- OH.

14:05.960 --> 14:08.160
THIS IS FINE.

14:08.200 --> 14:11.500
- ARE YOU A TOP OR A BOTTOM?

14:14.570 --> 14:16.240
- TOP...

14:16.270 --> 14:17.670
AND BOTTOM.

14:17.710 --> 14:19.980
- OH, YOU'RE VERSATILE,
THEN.

14:20.010 --> 14:21.440
- AND AMBIDEXTROUS...

14:21.480 --> 14:22.650
WHICH WAS REALLY CONFUSING
AT FIRST

14:22.680 --> 14:27.250
'CAUSE I COULD NEVER FIGURE OUT
WHICH HAND TO THROW WITH.

14:27.280 --> 14:28.680
- DO YOU LIKE TO RIM?

14:28.720 --> 14:30.320

14:30.350 --> 14:31.650
I LOVE IT.

14:31.690 --> 14:35.060

14:35.090 --> 14:37.030
GO TO IT.

14:38.660 --> 14:40.060

14:56.050 --> 14:57.080
NO, OF COURSE
YOU'RE NOT KIDDING ME.

14:57.110 --> 14:58.950
WHEN DID IT HAPPEN?

14:58.980 --> 15:01.350
WHY DIDN'T YOU CALL ME?

15:01.380 --> 15:04.690
WELL, OF COURSE I WAS OUT.
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

15:04.720 --> 15:06.320
- [grunting]

15:06.360 --> 15:08.220
AGH! AHH!
- SHIT!

15:08.260 --> 15:10.260
JESUS CHRIST!
I TOLD YOU NOT TO.

15:10.290 --> 15:12.060
- I TRIED.
I'M SORRY.

15:12.100 --> 15:13.400
- ALL OVER MY NEW DUVET.
- I TRIED, I TRIED.

15:13.430 --> 15:15.730
- THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

15:15.760 --> 15:17.700
- OH, IT'LL WASH OUT,
WON'T IT?

15:17.730 --> 15:20.170
I MEAN, YOU SHOULD SEE
MY SHEETS AT HOME.

15:20.200 --> 15:21.170
- JUST SOME KID.

15:21.200 --> 15:23.040
WHAT'S YOUR NAME AGAIN?

15:23.070 --> 15:25.570
- JUSTIN.

15:25.610 --> 15:27.340
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

15:33.420 --> 15:35.150

15:35.180 --> 15:36.550
JUST, UH, CAN'T SLEEP

15:36.590 --> 15:38.550
WITHOUT MY MILK AND OREOS.

15:38.590 --> 15:40.320
- THAT'S MY FRIEND EMMETT.

15:40.360 --> 15:41.390
HE'S STAYING WITH ME
TEMPORARILY

15:41.420 --> 15:43.460
SINCE THE HOOKER WHO LIVED
DOWN THE HALL FROM HIM

15:43.490 --> 15:46.730
BURNED HIS APARTMENT BUILDING
DOWN TWO YEARS AGO.

15:46.760 --> 15:49.400
- TWO YEARS IS A LONG TIME
TO BE TEMPORARY.

15:49.430 --> 15:51.670
- AND YET IT HASN'T INTERFERED
WITH MY LOVE LIFE.

15:51.700 --> 15:55.140
WHICH, I SUPPOSE, SAYS A LOT
ABOUT MY LOVE LIFE.

15:55.170 --> 15:57.510
- DO YOU MIND
IF WE SKIP THE BACK STORY

15:57.540 --> 15:58.610
AND CUT TO THE CHASE?

15:58.640 --> 16:00.680
IT'S ALMOST 2:00
IN THE MORNING.

16:05.480 --> 16:08.180

16:50.490 --> 16:51.660
- UH, NO ONE.

16:51.690 --> 16:53.800
- MIKEY, YOU'VE GOT SOMEONE
THERE WITH YOU.

16:53.830 --> 16:55.300
- I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

16:55.330 --> 16:56.700
- YOU SHOULD ONLY BE HERE.

16:56.730 --> 16:58.470
- FORGET ABOUT IT,
DON'T LET ME BOTHER YOU.

16:58.500 --> 17:00.300
FUCK THE SHIT OUT OF HIM.

17:00.340 --> 17:02.370
- NO, WAIT. PICK ME UP.
I'M--I'M READY.

17:02.410 --> 17:03.640

17:04.869 --> 17:06.540
- WE GOING TO DO THIS
OR NOT?

17:06.579 --> 17:09.150
- I AM REALLY, REALLY SORRY.

17:09.180 --> 17:12.079
UM, A FRIEND OF MINE NEEDS ME.
IT'S AN EMERGENCY.

17:12.119 --> 17:14.250

- I KNOW.

17:14.280 --> 17:15.650
I PROMISE
WE'LL RESCHEDULE THOUGH.

17:15.680 --> 17:17.619
NO IFs, ANDs OR...

17:21.660 --> 17:23.290

17:23.329 --> 17:25.230
COME ON, GET UP.
YOU GOTTA GO.

17:25.260 --> 17:26.560
- WHERE?

17:26.599 --> 17:28.130
- I CAN'T GO HOME NOW.
MY--

17:28.160 --> 17:29.700
MY PARENTS THINK I'M STAYING
AT A FRIEND'S.

17:29.730 --> 17:31.170
- YOU LIVE
WITH YOUR PARENTS?

17:31.200 --> 17:32.570
- WELL, I'M STILL IN SCHOOL.

17:47.220 --> 17:48.780

17:48.820 --> 17:50.850
- BULLSHIT. YOU HAD TO THINK
BEFORE YOU ANSWERED THAT.

17:50.890 --> 17:53.290
HOW OLD ARE YOU REALLY?

17:53.320 --> 17:57.190
- 20.

17:57.230 --> 17:58.230

18:02.630 --> 18:05.530
- WELL, WHAT IS THIS,
A MISSILE LAUNCH?

18:05.570 --> 18:07.500
- 17.
- [sighs]

18:07.540 --> 18:10.840
WHAT IS WITH KIDS TODAY?

18:10.870 --> 18:13.680
- WE JUST WANT TO GET LAID,
LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE.

18:13.710 --> 18:15.840
- HAVE YOU EVER
BEEN WITH ANYONE BEFORE?

18:15.880 --> 18:17.610
- SURE.

18:17.650 --> 18:21.350
WELL, NOT EXACTLY.

18:21.380 --> 18:23.320
THIS IS SORT OF MY FIRST.

18:24.650 --> 18:26.820

18:26.860 --> 18:28.260
KIND OF YOUNG,
AREN'T YOU?

18:30.290 --> 18:32.700
WELL, I WAS 14
MY FIRST TIME.

18:34.830 --> 18:36.500
- I BET HE WAS SOME OLD PERV.

18:36.530 --> 18:41.700
- THAT OLD PERV WAS PROBABLY
THE SAME AGE THAT I AM NOW.

18:41.740 --> 18:44.610
IT WAS AFTER SCHOOL
IN THE LOCKER ROOMS.

18:44.640 --> 18:46.740
[sighs]
HE WAS TAKING A SHOWER.

18:46.780 --> 18:48.610
I WENT BACK FOR SOMETHING.

18:48.640 --> 18:50.880
A BOOK, MY JOCKSTRAP...

18:50.910 --> 18:54.250
I DON'T REMEMBER.

18:54.280 --> 18:57.320
ANYWAY, THERE HE WAS,
ALL NAKED, SOAPING HIMSELF.

18:57.350 --> 18:59.190
HE SAW ME THERE,

18:59.220 --> 19:01.960
A BIG BONER
UNDER MY CHINOS.

19:01.990 --> 19:03.930
[chuckles]

19:03.960 --> 19:06.630
SHIT. I WALKED
RIGHT INTO THE SHOWERS

19:06.660 --> 19:07.800
WITH ALL MY CLOTHES ON.

19:07.830 --> 19:08.800
- NO.

19:08.830 --> 19:10.230
- GOT DOWN ON MY KNEES

19:10.270 --> 19:11.930
AND SUCKED HIM OFF
RIGHT THERE.

19:11.970 --> 19:13.800
- HE LET YOU?

19:13.840 --> 19:16.340
- LET ME?

19:16.370 --> 19:17.510
HE LOVED IT.

19:17.540 --> 19:19.810
- I BET YOU WERE SCARED.

19:19.840 --> 19:23.950
- WELL, I GUESS WE'RE ALL
A LITTLE SCARED OUR FIRST TIME.

19:29.520 --> 19:31.850

20:38.390 --> 20:40.890
- SIX HOURS LATER,
THERE HE WAS.

20:40.920 --> 20:43.030

I COULD HAVE BEEN HERE.

MINE THEN.

BUT I LIKE GUS.

21:13.560 --> 21:14.690

21:17.430 --> 21:21.060

AT SCHOOL BEING NAMED ABRAHAM.

21:21.100 --> 21:22.870
BUT I GUESS GUS IS OKAY.

21:22.900 --> 21:25.670

21:38.450 --> 21:40.520
HE'S ONLY 17.

21:40.550 --> 21:43.420

SUCK ON MY TITS.

22:12.620 --> 22:14.920
FAWNING OVER HIM
AND MAKING GOO-GOO TALK.

22:14.950 --> 22:20.020

DO OVER BABIES.

I MEAN JUSTIN.

22:27.500 --> 22:30.000

REMINDING YOU THAT YOU'RE
GETTING OLDER BY THE MINUTE.

OH, I THINK I SEE ONE.

WHY DIDN'T SOMEBODY
TRY AND STOP ME?

22:55.790 --> 22:57.890
- HELLO? SOMEBODY DID.

22:57.930 --> 22:59.500
BUT YOU WOULDN'T LISTEN.
YOU HAD TO LET LINDSAY

22:59.530 --> 23:01.860
FILL YOUR HEAD WITH ALL HER
BULLSHIT FLATTERY.

23:01.900 --> 23:04.030
"OH, BRIAN,
YOU'RE SO GOOD LOOKING.

"OH, OH, YOU'VE GOT
SUCH GREAT GENES, BRIAN,

23:09.540 --> 23:13.610
AND I DON'T MEAN YOUR 501s."

23:13.640 --> 23:16.810
AND NOW YOU'RE STUCK
WITH A KID.

23:16.850 --> 23:19.080
FOR LIFE.

23:23.690 --> 23:26.690
- WELL, THERE IS ALWAYS ONE
SOLUTION.

23:32.930 --> 23:35.030
I COULD END IT ALL
RIGHT NOW.

23:35.060 --> 23:38.070
- OH, THAT'D BE DRAMATIC.

23:38.100 --> 23:41.170
JUST LIKE ER, BIRTH AND DEATH
IN THE SAME EPISODE.

23:41.200 --> 23:43.710
NOW GET DOWN!

23:43.740 --> 23:45.070
- NO, YOU'LL HAVE
TO COME GET ME.

23:45.110 --> 23:47.240

* WHATEVER YOU DO

24:04.030 --> 24:07.200
* YOU'VE GOTTA STAY TRUE

24:07.230 --> 24:10.830
*

24:10.870 --> 24:12.100
* WHATEVER YOU DO

24:12.130 --> 24:15.000
- COME ON, MIKEY,
LET'S FLY.

24:15.040 --> 24:17.770
LIKE IN ALL THOSE
COMIC BOOKS.

24:21.740 --> 24:25.010
I'M SUPERMAN.

24:25.050 --> 24:26.750
I'LL SHOW YOU THE WORLD.

24:26.780 --> 24:29.790
- WHY AM I ALWAYS
LOIS LANE?

24:29.820 --> 24:34.590
- * OH, TO HOLD YOU
NEAR ME *

24:34.620 --> 24:42.600
*

24:45.630 --> 24:48.800
* EVERY TIME I THINK

24:48.840 --> 24:49.910
* THERE'S NO ONE

24:49.940 --> 24:54.710
- CONGRATULATIONS...DAD.

24:54.740 --> 24:58.150
- * EVERY TIME I WONDER

24:58.180 --> 25:00.720
* HOW I'LL COPE

25:00.750 --> 25:04.020
*

25:04.050 --> 25:08.660
* CAN'T WAIT FOR THE SUN
TO SHINE *

25:08.690 --> 25:13.900
* WHATEVER LIGHT
I HOPE TO FIND... *

25:13.930 --> 25:15.200
- SORRY.

25:17.730 --> 25:18.730
- HONESTLY.

25:18.770 --> 25:20.100
- FUCKED HIM.

25:20.140 --> 25:21.570
- YOU DID NOT.
YOU LOOKED AT HIM.

25:21.600 --> 25:22.840
- THAT MAY APPEAR TO BE
WHAT HAPPENED,

25:22.870 --> 25:24.140
BUT WE DID IT ALL.

25:24.170 --> 25:25.840
- OH, YEAH?
AND HOW WAS HE?

25:25.870 --> 25:27.910
- FABULOUS.

25:27.940 --> 25:29.340
WANT ONE?
- NO.

25:29.380 --> 25:32.680
- MORE FOR ME.

25:32.720 --> 25:34.750
LISTEN, YOU'RE GOING TO GO SAY
GOOD NIGHT TO LINDSAY.

25:34.780 --> 25:36.650
YOU'RE GOING TO GO HOME,
GO TO BED,

25:36.690 --> 25:39.050
AND GET UP AND GO TO WORK
FOR THE NEXT 20 YEARS

25:39.090 --> 25:41.660
TO SUPPORT YOUR KID.

25:41.690 --> 25:43.660
- YOU SEE THIS LINE,
HOW DEEP IT IS?

25:43.690 --> 25:45.090
THAT MEANS
YOU'RE VERY CREATIVE.

25:45.130 --> 25:46.160
- THAT'S TRUE.

25:46.190 --> 25:47.230
I WANT TO BE A CARTOONIST
OR A COMPUTER ANIMATOR.

25:47.260 --> 25:50.200
- IT'S FAR TOO LESBIANIC
OUT HERE FOR A YOUNG BOY.

25:50.230 --> 25:52.100
OUT.

25:52.130 --> 25:53.840
I'LL MEET YOU OUT FRONT.

25:58.240 --> 26:00.340
- I'M SORRY, SIR, YOU'LL
HAVE TO COME BACK TOMORROW.

26:00.380 --> 26:01.940
THE MOTHER NEEDS HER REST.

26:01.980 --> 26:03.010
- AND SO DOES THE FATHER.

26:03.050 --> 26:05.110
- IT'S OKAY, NURSE.

26:08.820 --> 26:11.690
- SWEET DREAMS, SONNY BOY.

26:11.720 --> 26:13.260
FIRST NIGHT ON EARTH.

26:14.820 --> 26:17.860
- HON, COULD YOU GET ME SOME ICE
AND MAYBE SOMETHING FIZZY?

26:17.890 --> 26:19.230
- HOW ABOUT
SOME GINGER ALE?

26:19.260 --> 26:22.230
MM. MWAH.

26:26.030 --> 26:27.300
- UH, ANYTHING FOR YOU?

26:27.340 --> 26:30.310
- UH, IF YOU SEE ANY
AMYL NITRATE LAYING AROUND.

26:38.280 --> 26:39.410
ALONE AT LAST.

26:39.450 --> 26:43.250
- CAREFUL.

26:43.290 --> 26:47.290
- WELL, HERE WE ARE.

26:47.320 --> 26:50.160
MA AND PA.

26:50.190 --> 26:51.730
- [crying]

26:51.760 --> 26:53.030
- HEY.

26:56.130 --> 26:58.930
- DON'T MIND ME.

26:58.970 --> 27:02.000
JUST FEELING A LITTLE...
VULNERABLE.

27:05.270 --> 27:08.410
[laughing]

27:08.440 --> 27:10.950
- I PROMISE NOT TO TELL.

27:10.980 --> 27:13.220
- WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT?

27:13.250 --> 27:14.880
YOU AND ME.

27:14.920 --> 27:18.120
PARENTS.

27:18.150 --> 27:22.190
- IT'S PRETTY SCARY,
BOYS AND GIRLS.

27:22.220 --> 27:24.060
THINK IT'S TOO LATE
TO RETURN IT?

27:24.090 --> 27:26.290
- WE COULD TRY.

27:26.330 --> 27:30.900
OH, GOD.

27:30.930 --> 27:32.940
I GUESS THIS MEANS
WE'RE FINALLY GROWN-UPS.

27:32.970 --> 27:34.740
- "DON'T SAY THAT, WENDY,

27:34.770 --> 27:35.940
WE'LL NEVER GROW UP."

27:35.970 --> 27:38.040
- DON'T BE SCARED.

27:38.070 --> 27:42.080
HELL, IF OUR PARENTS
COULD FUCK UP, SO CAN WE.

27:45.480 --> 27:47.280
- I DON'T WANT YOU
TO WORRY.

27:47.320 --> 27:49.020
ABOUT MONEY, I MEAN.

27:49.050 --> 27:50.220
IF YOU NEED ANYTHING--

27:50.250 --> 27:53.060
- NO, WE'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

27:53.090 --> 27:54.960
BUT THANKS.

28:00.360 --> 28:02.200
- I WOULD'VE FUCKED YOU,
YOU KNOW?

28:02.230 --> 28:04.100
- OHH.

28:04.130 --> 28:05.200
- IF I WASN'T AFRAID

28:05.230 --> 28:06.470
YOUR LOVER'D
BEAT THE SHIT OUT OF ME.

28:06.500 --> 28:08.140
- STOP.

28:08.170 --> 28:09.300
- I MEAN IT.

28:09.340 --> 28:11.140
SHE COULD TAKE OUT
OSCAR DE LA RENTA.

28:11.170 --> 28:14.340
- YOU MEAN LA HOYA.

28:14.380 --> 28:16.850
- WHATEVER.
[both chuckle]

28:16.880 --> 28:20.380
- WELL, YOU HAD PLENTY
OF CHANCES.

28:20.420 --> 28:22.750
- AND I TOOK ADVANTAGE OF A FEW,
IF I RECALL.

28:22.790 --> 28:25.850
- IT WASN'T HALF BAD.

28:25.890 --> 28:28.190
- NOW YOU TELL ME?

28:28.220 --> 28:31.530
YOU MEAN I COULD HAVE BEEN
STRAIGHT THIS WHOLE TIME?

28:31.560 --> 28:34.500
- I WOULDN'T SAY THAT.

28:34.530 --> 28:37.270
- WELL, THEN I GUESS
IT'S JUST AS WELL.

28:46.170 --> 28:48.010
- ICE?

28:49.540 --> 28:52.080
- TICK-TICK-TICK.

28:52.110 --> 28:54.120
TICK.

28:54.150 --> 28:55.320
TICK.

28:55.350 --> 28:56.520
TICK.

28:56.550 --> 28:58.050
TICK.

28:58.090 --> 29:01.120
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

29:01.160 --> 29:02.860
- I'M JUST REPEATING
THE FIRST WORDS

29:02.890 --> 29:04.330
MY SONNY BOY SAID TO ME.

29:04.360 --> 29:06.460
IT WASN'T "DA-DA."

29:06.490 --> 29:10.030
IT WAS,
"TICK-TICK-TICK-TICK."

29:10.070 --> 29:13.570
SMART LITTLE FUCKER.

29:13.600 --> 29:16.000
HE CAN TELL TIME ALREADY.

29:16.040 --> 29:19.110
- BRIAN, WHAT DID YOU TAKE?

29:19.140 --> 29:23.480
- * A-B-C-D-E-E-E

29:23.510 --> 29:24.950
[chuckles]

29:24.980 --> 29:27.780
I'M JUST TEACHING MY KID
THE ALPHABET.

29:30.290 --> 29:32.220
I'M GOING TO FUCK YOU.

29:32.250 --> 29:36.320
I'M GOING TO FUCK YOU
ALL...NIGHT.

29:36.360 --> 29:38.430

29:46.600 --> 29:50.410
[revs engine, tires screech]

29:50.440 --> 29:51.570
- SHIT!

29:51.610 --> 29:54.040
- SORRY, I DIDN'T
WANT TO HIT THAT DOGGIE.

29:54.080 --> 29:55.480
- FUCK THE DOGGIE.

29:55.510 --> 29:57.150
- OKAY, BOY WONDER.

29:57.180 --> 29:59.050
I'M TAKING YOU HOME.
WHERE DO I TURN?

29:59.080 --> 30:00.180
- HE'S GOING WITH ME.

30:00.220 --> 30:01.420
- OH, NO, HE'S NOT.

30:01.450 --> 30:03.920
- POP QUIZ.
NO TALKING.

30:03.950 --> 30:06.150
HERE'S A QUESTION.
MULTIPLE CHOICE.

30:06.190 --> 30:07.460
DO YOU WANT TO COME HOME

TICK, TICK, TICK.
TIME'S UP.

30:15.100 --> 30:18.030
PENCILS DOWN.
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

30:18.070 --> 30:19.870
- NONE OF THE ABOVE.

30:19.900 --> 30:20.900
HE'S GOING HOME.

30:20.940 --> 30:22.540
- I'M GOING WITH HIM.

30:25.040 --> 30:27.340
- GOOD BOY.

30:27.380 --> 30:29.440
YOU GET AN A-PLUS.

30:34.250 --> 30:36.420
[heavy breathing]

- [gasping]

30:46.630 --> 30:49.500
[gasping loudly]

30:49.530 --> 30:52.230

BEGS ME TO GO WITH HIM,

KNOWING FULL WELL
I'M WITH SOMEONE

31:01.340 --> 31:04.250
- SEVEN MONTHS,
TWO WEEKS, AND THREE DAYS.

31:04.280 --> 31:05.510
- THANK YOU.

31:05.550 --> 31:07.620
AND EVEN THOUGH THE GUY WASN'T
ALL HE WAS CRACKED UP TO BE...

31:07.650 --> 31:09.620
- WE'LL LET THAT REMARK PASS.

31:09.650 --> 31:11.920
- AT LEAST HE WANTED ME.

31:11.950 --> 31:12.890
ME.

31:16.420 --> 31:19.430
GOD, I AM SO HORNY!

31:19.460 --> 31:21.600
- POOR BABY.

31:21.630 --> 31:23.230
WELL, I HAVE
JUST THE THING.

31:23.270 --> 31:25.000
A NEW PORN VIDEO.

31:25.030 --> 31:28.700
IT ALL TAKES PLACE
IN A PRISONER-OF-WAR CAMP.

"HOT, HORNY MEN STARVED
FOR ACTION."

31:32.110 --> 31:34.010
- I CAN RELATE TO THAT.

PRIVATES STAND UP AND SALUTE.

31:36.710 --> 31:38.210
SCHINDLER'S FIST?

31:38.250 --> 31:39.950

31:39.980 --> 31:42.650
HERE, I WILL LEAVE
YOU TWO ALONE.

31:42.680 --> 31:44.220
I'M SURE YOU'RE GOING
TO HAVE A DEEP,

31:44.250 --> 31:46.290
MEANINGFUL RELATIONSHIP.

31:46.320 --> 31:47.960
GOOD NIGHT.

31:53.030 --> 31:54.730
- [on TV] OKAY,
PRIVATE, DROP TROU

31:54.760 --> 31:56.100
AND BEND OVER.

31:56.130 --> 31:57.330

FOR MY PHYSICAL, SIR?

31:57.370 --> 31:59.030
- NO, TARGET PRACTICE.

31:59.070 --> 32:00.300
- YES, SIR.

32:00.340 --> 32:01.600

32:03.540 --> 32:07.310
ON MY SHOULDERS.

32:07.340 --> 32:08.640
THAT'S IT.

32:10.480 --> 32:12.050
- OH, WAIT.

32:12.080 --> 32:14.180
IN SCHOOL,
WE HAD THIS LECTURE...

32:14.220 --> 32:17.120
ABOUT SAFE SEX.

32:17.150 --> 32:19.490
- AND NOW WE'RE GOING TO HAVE
A DEMONSTRATION.

32:23.030 --> 32:24.030
PTUH!

32:26.230 --> 32:28.400

32:48.780 --> 32:50.290
- JUST...

32:50.320 --> 32:52.150
GO SLOW, OKAY?

33:00.160 --> 33:01.430
AGH!

33:01.460 --> 33:04.200
AH! AH!

33:04.230 --> 33:06.700
[panting]
IT HURTS.

33:06.730 --> 33:08.340
DOES IT ALWAYS HURT?

33:08.370 --> 33:11.470
A LITTLE BIT.

33:11.510 --> 33:14.410
BUT THAT'S A PART OF IT.

33:14.440 --> 33:17.250
[exhales]

33:17.280 --> 33:18.310
NOW RELAX.

33:22.080 --> 33:26.490

34:35.520 --> 34:38.090

34:55.780 --> 34:59.710
WHAT THE FUCK
ARE YOU DOING HERE?

34:59.750 --> 35:03.750
- YOU SAID I COULD STAY.

35:03.790 --> 35:04.890
- RIGHT.

35:04.920 --> 35:06.590
YOUR PARENTS.

35:06.620 --> 35:09.360
THEY THINK
YOU'RE AT A FRIEND'S.

35:16.530 --> 35:19.400
JESUS CHRIST!
WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED?

35:20.900 --> 35:22.270
- [laughs]

35:22.300 --> 35:24.340
- DON'T TELL ME.

35:24.370 --> 35:25.770
I WAS DOING HANDSTANDS.

35:25.810 --> 35:27.340
- AND JUGGLING.

35:27.380 --> 35:29.580
YOU'RE NOT VERY GOOD.

35:29.610 --> 35:31.450
- SHIT.

35:31.480 --> 35:34.580
WHY DO I DO THESE THINGS?

35:34.620 --> 35:36.450
I'LL TELL YOU WHY.

35:36.480 --> 35:39.390
IT WAS THAT FUCKING PIG
ANITA.

35:39.420 --> 35:41.660
SHE TOLD ME THAT WAS "E."
THAT WASN'T "E,"

35:41.690 --> 35:44.790
THAT WAS SOME SHIT THEY COOKED
UP IN A BATHTUB IN TIJUANA.

35:44.830 --> 35:46.660
- THAT'S WHY YOU SHOULD NEVER
TAKE DRUGS

35:46.690 --> 35:48.430
THAT AREN'T PRESCRIBED
BY A PHYSICIAN

35:48.460 --> 35:51.770
OR RECOMMENDED
BY A RELIABLE PHARMACIST.

35:53.600 --> 35:55.370
- [chuckles]

35:55.400 --> 35:56.570
WHAT ARE YOU,

35:56.600 --> 35:58.770
A PUBLIC SERVICE
ANNOUNCEMENT?

36:00.940 --> 36:02.980
GET DRESSED,
I'LL DRIVE YOU HOME.

36:03.010 --> 36:05.950
- YOU CAN'T.

36:05.980 --> 36:08.850
MICHAEL HAS THE CAR.
- WHY HAS HE GOT IT?

36:08.880 --> 36:10.690
- YOU WERE TOO HIGH--
- I KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.

36:10.720 --> 36:12.750
I WAS THERE.

36:12.790 --> 36:16.390
I REMEMBER EVERYTHING...

36:16.420 --> 36:17.630
PERFECTLY.

36:20.330 --> 36:21.760
WHAT WAS YOUR NAME AGAIN?

36:21.800 --> 36:24.700

36:24.730 --> 36:27.970
- YEAH, RIGHT.

36:28.000 --> 36:30.470

38:02.960 --> 38:05.500
YOU KNOW HOW HE FEELS
ABOUT HIS JEEP.

38:05.530 --> 38:06.930
- WELL, IF HE CARES SO MUCH
ABOUT IT

38:06.970 --> 38:08.600
THEN HE SHOULDN'T
HAVE LENT IT TO ME.

38:08.640 --> 38:11.710
HE KNOWS WHAT A TERRIBLE
NEIGHBORHOOD THIS IS.

38:11.740 --> 38:13.840
- WELL, I, UH, I WAS GOING
TO ASK FOR A LIFT TO WORK,

38:13.880 --> 38:16.810
BUT, ON SECOND THOUGHT,
I THINK I'LL WALK.

I HAD A KID?

38:48.910 --> 38:50.810

EVERYTHING.

38:50.850 --> 38:53.950

HAPPENED SO FAST.

38:53.980 --> 38:55.820
WHAT'S HIS NAME AGAIN?

38:55.850 --> 38:57.690

39:09.100 --> 39:10.970

39:11.000 --> 39:13.030
AND THEY SQUIRTED IT UP HER.

39:13.070 --> 39:14.140

39:14.170 --> 39:16.140
SHE MUST HAVE REALLY
WANTED A KID.

39:16.170 --> 39:18.670
- MOST WOMEN DO.

39:18.710 --> 39:20.170
- EVEN LESBIANS?

39:20.210 --> 39:23.750
- LESBIANS ARE WOMEN...

39:23.780 --> 39:26.510
SORT OF.

39:26.550 --> 39:29.750
- MY MOM SAYS SOMETIMES
SHE WISHED SHE NEVER HAD ME.

39:29.780 --> 39:31.090
- THAT'S PROBABLY
BECAUSE SHE'S STUCK

39:31.120 --> 39:34.390
WITH THIS ANNOYING BRAT
FOR THE REST OF HER LIFE.

39:37.990 --> 39:40.500

TO RAISE HIM?

39:40.530 --> 39:42.530
- [laughing]
ME?

39:42.560 --> 39:44.770
NO WAY.

39:44.800 --> 39:47.170
THE MUNCHERS ARE.

39:47.200 --> 39:49.900
BUT I'LL BE AROUND TO PROVIDE
THE MASCULINE INFLUENCE

39:49.940 --> 39:53.780
SO IMPORTANT
IN EVERY YOUNG BOY'S LIFE.

39:53.810 --> 39:55.780

BETTER THAN YOU.

39:55.810 --> 39:58.650

OR I'LL HAVE TO SPANK YOU.

39:58.680 --> 40:00.980

40:48.300 --> 40:53.000

AS ENOUGH.

40:53.030 --> 40:55.600
BESIDES, I COULDN'T
SEND HIM OFF

40:55.640 --> 40:58.770
WITHOUT A NOURISHING,
HIGH-PROTEIN BREAKFAST.

41:26.300 --> 41:29.640
* IS IN A HURRY

41:29.670 --> 41:31.840
* IN A HURRY
- YEAH, WHAT DID SHE SAY?

41:31.870 --> 41:34.240
- SHE SAID,
"DON'T BE LATE."

41:36.110 --> 41:38.610
OH, THAT'S BEAUTIFUL,
MIKEY.

41:38.650 --> 41:40.280
JUST BEAUTIFUL.

41:40.310 --> 41:41.450

41:41.480 --> 41:44.150
I TOLD YOU ABOUT THOSE TWO
PSYCHOPATHS DOWN THE STREET.

41:44.190 --> 41:45.750
- WHAT, A COUPLE
OF 12-YEAR-OLDS?

41:45.790 --> 41:47.860
- THEY START EARLY
THESE DAYS.

41:47.890 --> 41:49.290
WHAT ARE YOU LAUGHING AT?

41:49.320 --> 41:50.890
- NOTHING.

41:50.930 --> 41:53.230
YOU.

41:53.260 --> 41:55.860
YOU SOUND LIKE MY PARENTS
FIGHTING.

41:58.670 --> 41:59.970
- IT DOESN'T MATTER ANYWAY.

42:00.000 --> 42:01.770
IT'S A COMPANY CAR.

42:04.110 --> 42:06.840
WELL, COME ON, WE HAVE TO TAKE
THE CHILD TO SCHOOL.

42:06.870 --> 42:09.180

TELL HIM ABOUT THAT?

I SAID
YOU WERE STILL ASLEEP.
