We have failed to recreate the
musical magic of the B.E.R.

00:28.202 --> 00:30.247
I ain't about to
give up on Cyborg.

00:30.291 --> 00:32.293
There's a way in.
I knows it.

00:32.336 --> 00:33.685
Sure, the song.

00:33.729 --> 00:35.992
But it's trapped with
Cyborg in the other world.

00:36.036 --> 00:39.256
And none of those famous musicians we
visited would help us recreate it.

00:39.300 --> 00:40.953
Don't you remember
what Cyborg said?

00:40.997 --> 00:43.260
That music lives
in all of us, yo.

00:43.304 --> 00:45.523
We's been imbooted with it.

stuck in my head for so long?

00:48.439 --> 00:50.267
That's right, yo.

00:50.311 --> 00:52.313
So alls we gots to do is
listen to the universe, baby.

with the music in our hearts

00:54.358 --> 00:55.925

to get Cyborg back,

00:55.968 --> 00:57.709
with, like, some kind
of sign or something.

05:36.597 --> 05:38.468

06:02.971 --> 06:04.842
So, what brings you
to these parts?

06:04.886 --> 06:06.888
Just, uh, taking some time off.

06:06.931 --> 06:09.717
You know, chilling out to
the max, relaxing all cool.

06:09.760 --> 06:12.546
You ain't got the look
of a man on his leisure hours.

06:12.589 --> 06:13.590
How can you tell?

06:13.634 --> 06:15.244

I see the story in your eyes.

06:18.465 --> 06:20.031
What? You know the song?

06:20.684 --> 06:21.946
What song?

06:21.990 --> 06:23.600
Uh, never mind.

06:23.644 --> 06:26.690
Anyway, if you got a problem,
it might help to talk it out.

06:26.734 --> 06:30.259
My best bro Cyborg
disappeared forever.

06:30.302 --> 06:32.566
When me and him was doing
things, I knowed who I was

06:32.609 --> 06:33.610
and where I was going.

06:33.654 --> 06:36.352
But now he's gone and so,

06:36.396 --> 06:38.049
I gots to find myself.

06:38.093 --> 06:39.442
I don't know if I can
help you find yourself,

06:39.486 --> 06:41.444
but I can help you
get back on the road.

06:41.488 --> 06:42.619
I'm Billy.

06:42.663 --> 06:43.664
Beast Boy.

06:47.798 --> 06:51.236
Let me tell you a story,
little machine man.

06:51.280 --> 06:52.586
Once, long ago,

06:52.629 --> 06:55.632
I had created
a kingdom without rival.

06:55.676 --> 06:57.982
No one dared challenge me.

06:58.635 --> 07:00.594
But then, they came.

07:00.637 --> 07:04.467
Three astral beings, born from
the collision of 1,000 planets

07:04.511 --> 07:07.339
and imbued with the
power of stardust.

07:07.383 --> 07:09.429
B.E.R.

07:09.472 --> 07:13.476
Together, they created a sound
more powerful than any.

07:13.520 --> 07:18.263
The Night Begins to Shine gave
birth to an entirely new reality,

07:18.307 --> 07:21.876
warping space
and time around itself.

07:21.919 --> 07:24.922
For millennia, no one
dared to challenge me,

07:24.966 --> 07:26.750
my power was so great.

07:26.794 --> 07:30.798
And yet, their song left me
helpless as a newborn babe.

07:30.841 --> 07:33.017
They were too radical.

07:33.061 --> 07:37.761
From that day forward, the night
would always shine in this land.

07:37.805 --> 07:40.242
But B.E.R. feared
what might happen

07:40.285 --> 07:43.593
if the song fell
into the wrong hands.

07:43.637 --> 07:46.466
My hands.

07:46.509 --> 07:49.033
So, they sealed it
within a cassette tape

07:49.077 --> 07:51.340
and hid it away from this world.

07:51.383 --> 07:54.604
And then, like that,
B.E.R. disappeared

07:54.648 --> 07:57.172
as quickly as they had come.

07:57.215 --> 07:59.783
I never thought
I'd hear that song again,

07:59.827 --> 08:02.612
but you brought it right to me.

08:02.656 --> 08:06.660
Now, I'll use it to
take back what is mine.

08:06.703 --> 08:08.096
You're wasting your time!

08:08.139 --> 08:10.402
B.E.R. will just
stop you again.

08:10.446 --> 08:11.969
Fool, they're in hiding.

08:12.013 --> 08:13.797
No one will find them.

08:15.451 --> 08:17.845
B.E.R. is gone forever.

08:22.763 --> 08:24.634
Dang pigeon. Quit buggin', yo.

08:26.462 --> 08:27.942
Whoa! Is this you?

Wow, cool guitar.

08:40.694 --> 08:41.956

08:59.582 --> 09:01.366
