WEBVTT

00:02.602 --> 00:04.776
That thing's like a big champagne bottle.

00:04.838 --> 00:07.910
We had to get hauled in just
when it's gonna blow its top.

00:10.511 --> 00:11.990
Bowden was with her. He took the ledgers.

00:12.045 --> 00:14.525
Get on the radio, bring the choppers in. Now!

00:27.594 --> 00:29.369
Oh, mother of God!

01:42.336 --> 01:44.373
The big story here in the Northwest

01:44.438 --> 01:47.044
continues to be the eruption
watch at Mount Catherine.

01:47.107 --> 01:48.677
The long-dormant volcano

01:48.742 --> 01:51.848
has been showing signs of returning
to life for sometime now,

01:51.912 --> 01:55.086
sending out columns of steam and
rocking the earth with tremors.

01:55.148 --> 01:58.220
Scientists are using the
latest seismological equipment

01:58.285 --> 02:02.756
and are excited about the awesome
opportunity to observe nature close up.

02:05.158 --> 02:08.264
You be sure and keep your eyes glued
to that external temperature gauge.

02:08.328 --> 02:11.366
I'd rather not end up fried to a crisp either.

02:11.431 --> 02:13.502
Not in the name of science.

02:13.567 --> 02:14.671
I know what you mean.

02:15.235 --> 02:16.942
That thing's like a big champagne bottle

02:17.004 --> 02:20.508
that nature's been shaking for
the last 25 million years.

02:20.574 --> 02:23.316
We had to get hauled in here just
when it's gonna blow its top.

02:23.377 --> 02:25.653
Speaking of which, here it comes.

02:38.058 --> 02:40.698
There she is, in front of you.

02:47.768 --> 02:51.215
She's about to blow, That
thing's gonna go any minute.

03:06.319 --> 03:08.060
What did you say?

03:08.188 --> 03:09.531
It's from Dante.

03:09.589 --> 03:12.832
Literally translated, it means,

03:12.893 --> 03:15.533
“Abandon all hope ye who enter here.”

03:15.962 --> 03:19.034
It was written over the entrance to hell.

03:27.908 --> 03:31.321
Okay String, I've got a vent
just down the hill a bit.

03:31.378 --> 03:33.688
How many samples do we need to get, anyway?

03:33.747 --> 03:35.920
Oh, a couple of dozen, at least.

03:35.982 --> 03:39.191
Gas and steam from vents
at different elevations.

03:39.252 --> 03:40.959
Oh, we're gonna be here for a little while.

03:41.021 --> 03:43.331
Well, I sure hope it's worth it.

03:43.457 --> 03:46.768
Well, if the University's
analysis program works,

03:46.860 --> 03:49.773
we'll know the old mountain's
next move before she does.

03:51.565 --> 03:54.978
Okay. I'll settle her in
just as close as I can.

03:55.635 --> 03:57.512
There's got to be an easier
way to make a living

03:57.571 --> 04:00.347
for a guy with a helicopter than this.

04:16.123 --> 04:19.127
Survey One to Base, how was that placement?

04:22.195 --> 04:24.334
Right on the money, Survey One.

04:24.397 --> 04:26.707
Looks like that copper ore goes on forever.

04:31.037 --> 04:32.983
She's about 5 miles out of town.

04:33.039 --> 04:36.020
I got one of the units giving
her a real nice escort.

04:36.109 --> 04:37.349
Everything's all set up.

04:37.410 --> 04:38.548
Good.

04:38.612 --> 04:39.989
The only thing I don't understand is

04:40.046 --> 04:41.821
why we bother to do this every year.

04:41.882 --> 04:44.260
She don't even control the company anymore.

04:44.851 --> 04:46.091
Thanks.

04:46.887 --> 04:50.960
We bother with this little feudal
ceremony every year, Chief,

04:51.024 --> 04:54.005
because the name of the company is Davenport,

04:54.161 --> 04:57.005
and she's the last one of those around.

04:57.397 --> 04:59.172
People need symbols.

04:59.866 --> 05:04.508
You give 'em a queen, they'll forget about
the dirt under their own fingernails.

05:19.419 --> 05:20.898
So today,

05:21.021 --> 05:25.060
with the dedication of New
Gideon Pit Number II,

05:25.392 --> 05:29.898
we further fulfill the promise
of my late husband, Albert,

05:30.030 --> 05:32.806
to supply the world with copper

05:32.866 --> 05:37.815
and give work to the best group
of miners ever assembled.

05:43.777 --> 05:48.487
So, that despite the ebb and
flow of economic conditions,

05:48.548 --> 05:51.654
Davenport Mines will still flourish

05:51.718 --> 05:53.698
and provide a fair…

05:53.753 --> 05:55.596
Mrs. Davenport!

05:55.856 --> 05:57.199
Mrs. Daven…

06:16.610 --> 06:18.021
You know,

06:18.245 --> 06:21.522
it seems that when my husband was still alive

06:21.715 --> 06:23.820
we were down here much more.

06:23.884 --> 06:26.194
Holidays, weddings,

06:26.353 --> 06:28.959
births, and the sad times as well.

06:30.757 --> 06:34.364
But today, it appears that the distance

06:35.328 --> 06:37.934
between Denver is much further

06:38.431 --> 06:41.435
and I'm afraid that

06:42.202 --> 06:45.479
without this, I couldn't make it at all.

06:47.474 --> 06:49.317
But we're family,

06:50.043 --> 06:51.818
my only family.

06:53.046 --> 06:56.391
And I did so much want to be here with you.

07:02.889 --> 07:04.061
All secure?

07:04.124 --> 07:07.264
Sorry about that, John. We jumped
on it real fast. She never saw.

07:07.460 --> 07:08.530
Okay.

07:08.595 --> 07:11.235
I'll see the old lady into
her limo and out of here.

07:11.298 --> 07:12.936
Then at the next shift change,

07:12.999 --> 07:15.673
we're into a chopper for a
little R & R at the lodge.

07:19.272 --> 07:21.013
May I help you to your car?

07:21.074 --> 07:22.109
Thank you.

07:22.175 --> 07:24.086
It was an excellent speech.

07:25.578 --> 07:27.956
Are you sure you won't spend
the night, Mrs. Davenport?

07:28.014 --> 07:29.687
We have a suite of rooms reserved.

07:29.749 --> 07:31.023
No, I…

07:31.217 --> 07:32.821
Thank you, I think not.

07:33.753 --> 07:36.256
An old person needs her own bed.

07:37.223 --> 07:39.328
Well, we're sure glad you came.

07:40.293 --> 07:43.604
It's something we always look
forward to and you were a big hit.

07:44.130 --> 07:46.974
Not as big as in years past, I fear.

07:47.834 --> 07:50.371
But then times change.

07:51.071 --> 07:53.142
As you say, times change.

07:53.206 --> 07:54.583
Safe home.

07:57.744 --> 08:00.884
Oh, I have one last little present for you.

08:03.316 --> 08:06.854
There will be copper and
miners here for 100 years.

08:09.356 --> 08:10.596
Thank you.

08:28.441 --> 08:31.547
But Mr. Cove, what if I need
to consult with someone?

08:31.611 --> 08:33.147
You're taking all the senior men with you.

08:33.212 --> 08:35.591
We're leaving Officer
Hadene here to back you up.

08:35.849 --> 08:37.658
Let's see if you can handle it.

09:23.430 --> 09:25.410
How are we doing, Dom?

09:25.765 --> 09:27.403
Well, that's it, String.

09:27.467 --> 09:29.276
We got all the samples we need.

09:39.345 --> 09:41.882
Now, as soon as I've entered all the data…

09:41.948 --> 09:44.292
And let the program run…

09:44.884 --> 09:46.727
And in a couple of minutes…

09:51.057 --> 09:52.627
What was that?

09:59.432 --> 10:03.312
400 kiloton explosion at a range of 10 miles.

10:16.816 --> 10:18.921
Oh, mother of God!

10:19.619 --> 10:21.121
Hang on, Dom.

11:42.769 --> 11:44.840
Dom, we're over-heating real bad.

11:45.838 --> 11:48.444
We might have to set her
down. Give me a reading.

11:48.575 --> 11:51.647
Are you kidding? I can't get a thing.

11:53.213 --> 11:56.092
I got someth’n. There's a blue light.

12:16.970 --> 12:19.814
Oh, thank God. We're down.

12:24.010 --> 12:25.387
Now what?

12:27.947 --> 12:30.188
I suppose we just wait it out.

12:46.032 --> 12:47.443
Mamma mia!

12:50.203 --> 12:53.207
This looks like the surface of the moon.

12:58.211 --> 13:00.248
There's the light we saw.

13:00.446 --> 13:02.289
Let's go check it out.

13:18.598 --> 13:20.669
This poor fella's had it.

13:24.037 --> 13:27.541
You know, this New Gideon ought
to be close by here someplace.

13:27.607 --> 13:29.518
We better take him in.

13:29.942 --> 13:31.717
You mean carry him?

13:32.645 --> 13:33.715
These lights are still working.

13:33.780 --> 13:36.056
Maybe we can fire this thing up.

13:36.182 --> 13:37.991
Let's give it a try.

13:52.532 --> 13:54.102
In a huge area of the state,

13:54.167 --> 13:56.807
from Johnstown and Cold River,
and as far north as New Gideon,

13:56.869 --> 13:58.746
rivers and streams continue to flood

13:58.805 --> 14:01.843
and dust fills the air after the
violent eruption of Mount Catherine.

14:01.908 --> 14:06.254
The blast was equal to the detonation
of 27 Hiroshima-size bombs.

14:06.312 --> 14:10.124
We will continue to broadcast not knowing
whether our signal is getting through.

14:21.461 --> 14:23.566
Mamma mia, look at this.

14:24.931 --> 14:26.239
Now, that's spooky.

14:27.467 --> 14:29.606
Spooky or not, looks like it's gonna be home

14:29.669 --> 14:31.205
until we get the lady back in the air.

14:36.209 --> 14:38.553
Officer Hadene, this is Bowden.

14:38.611 --> 14:40.784
Please respond. Is there anyone out there?

14:40.847 --> 14:41.917
Look.

14:45.385 --> 14:47.956
Police! It's the police!

14:48.020 --> 14:49.465
Run! Everybody run!

14:49.522 --> 14:51.559
Just take the heater. Come on. Come on.

14:51.624 --> 14:52.967
Wait a minute!

14:53.025 --> 14:54.868
Fred, come on. Get out of here. Run!

14:54.927 --> 14:56.600
Wait, we're not…

14:56.863 --> 14:58.206
They think that we're…

14:59.932 --> 15:01.070
They're looters.

15:12.078 --> 15:14.786
What're you doing?

15:15.081 --> 15:16.958
Who the hell are you?

15:17.150 --> 15:18.652
I'm the one asking the questions.

15:19.218 --> 15:20.697
What's that supposed to mean?

15:21.854 --> 15:24.198
It means that if you don’t own that box,

15:24.257 --> 15:26.294
you'd better stop prying on it.

15:29.829 --> 15:31.365
Come on, Ken.

15:41.340 --> 15:42.410
What are they?

15:42.475 --> 15:44.512
Heaters, kerosene heaters.

15:44.577 --> 15:46.022
Have they gone?

15:46.078 --> 15:47.614
Is it safe?

15:47.880 --> 15:49.450
Officer Hadene?

15:50.750 --> 15:53.026
No sir, I'm afraid that he's dead.

15:53.586 --> 15:56.362
Well now, who are you?
You're not from New Gideon.

15:56.422 --> 15:58.163
No, we're pilots.

15:58.758 --> 16:00.362
We were forced down by the eruption.

16:00.426 --> 16:02.804
And we'd sure like to be on
our way again. So if you know…

16:02.862 --> 16:05.399
No, no. No, no, no, no. You can't leave.

16:05.465 --> 16:07.240
Didn't you hear me on the
radio? You've got to help me.

16:07.300 --> 16:09.041
You see, we've got valuable property here.

16:09.101 --> 16:12.173
Davenport Mining property.
And it's got to be protected.

16:13.506 --> 16:14.780
It would seem to me

16:14.841 --> 16:17.549
that the first priority would be to see
if there's anybody injured or hurt.

16:18.678 --> 16:19.713
Oh,

16:19.779 --> 16:22.350
well, yes, that too, of course. But…

16:22.415 --> 16:24.520
And have a place with lights.

16:24.784 --> 16:26.286
And heat.

16:26.652 --> 16:28.689
You need an emergency facility.

16:29.722 --> 16:32.168
We can use this room, wait here.

16:36.963 --> 16:39.637
There's a generator in back, follow me.

16:56.716 --> 16:58.718
Did you get the Officer buried?

17:00.019 --> 17:01.464
Okay.

17:01.821 --> 17:04.267
Now wish me luck. Let me give it a try.

17:28.915 --> 17:31.088
I can't raise a thing on this radio.

17:31.150 --> 17:32.857
Must be all that dust in the air.

17:33.553 --> 17:35.897
You know String, I've been look’n around,

17:35.955 --> 17:37.832
and I got a funny feel’n about this place.

17:37.890 --> 17:39.733
I don't know. I just can't quite figure it out.

17:39.792 --> 17:41.601
I know what you mean.

17:41.661 --> 17:43.334
What do you say we make a run through town,

17:43.396 --> 17:45.376
and announce that we've got
power here for the people.

17:45.431 --> 17:47.433
Man, anything. Let's go.

18:03.749 --> 18:07.322
There's light and heat available
at the Company Store!

18:08.888 --> 18:10.925
Anyone needing assistance,

18:11.123 --> 18:13.194
come to the Company Store!

18:14.627 --> 18:17.130
There's light and heat available.

18:18.297 --> 18:20.106
You know, I think I'm talking to myself.

18:20.166 --> 18:22.407
Excuse me officers, wait a minute.

18:28.674 --> 18:30.153
Who are you?

18:30.710 --> 18:33.714
You're not Police Officers.
I know all my husband's men.

18:34.180 --> 18:36.091
Is your husband the Chief of Police?

18:37.316 --> 18:38.420
No.

18:38.484 --> 18:40.555
John Cove, General Manager.

18:40.920 --> 18:43.924
Off hunt’n with his drunken
friends when we need him the most.

18:43.990 --> 18:45.298
Where?

18:45.358 --> 18:47.395
I don't know, in the woods.

18:47.460 --> 18:49.440
Now look, 10 minutes ago,

18:49.495 --> 18:52.408
one of them miners broke into
my house and stole my heater.

18:53.299 --> 18:54.471
What?

18:54.533 --> 18:57.309
Nick Cranovich, bold as brass.

18:57.603 --> 19:00.447
While I stood there and watched, he took it.

19:00.506 --> 19:03.214
Now I'd like to know, just
who does he think he is?

19:04.276 --> 19:06.415
Well, do you know where he lives?

19:07.146 --> 19:09.422
Right down there in Number 5.

19:09.548 --> 19:11.494
Now you just bring that
heater back to my house

19:11.550 --> 19:13.223
once you get him locked up.

19:13.552 --> 19:14.997
Yes, ma'am.

19:28.634 --> 19:29.874
Yes?

19:30.436 --> 19:32.143
Mrs. Cranovich?

19:32.571 --> 19:33.845
Yes.

19:34.874 --> 19:38.185
We have a report that that heater is stolen.

19:42.848 --> 19:44.555
Do you know Mrs. Cove?

19:45.751 --> 19:47.560
We all know Mrs. Cove.

19:48.054 --> 19:51.228
Look, these trailers are heated by electricity.

19:51.457 --> 19:53.300
My neighbors are freezing.

19:53.459 --> 19:55.336
I can't afford to do that.

20:00.166 --> 20:03.113
Would you let us take you down to
the Store? They have heat there.

20:04.937 --> 20:07.144
Take the damn heater back to her.

20:07.807 --> 20:10.481
I'll put on another sweater
and walk the floor all night.

20:17.116 --> 20:18.686
Look, please…

20:20.086 --> 20:22.396
Let's take you where it's safe.

21:02.194 --> 21:03.798
Here you are.

21:03.963 --> 21:05.738
Thank you. Good night.

21:05.798 --> 21:07.675
Say, you've got heat, huh?

21:07.733 --> 21:08.837
I'll take it, thank you.

21:08.901 --> 21:11.609
Well, if you got heat,
what do you need this for?

21:11.804 --> 21:13.306
Good night.

21:24.550 --> 21:25.927
What's the estimate now?

21:25.985 --> 21:27.794
Mr. Cove,

21:28.320 --> 21:29.628
you're the boss and all,

21:29.688 --> 21:32.601
but if you keep asking me that every 20
minutes, I'm gonna up and leave you here.

21:32.658 --> 21:33.693
Okay, okay.

21:33.759 --> 21:37.571
You're just damn lucky that none of these
machines was in the air when it blew.

21:38.197 --> 21:39.676
So, what do you want?

21:39.732 --> 21:43.703
1 machine in the air in 10 hours, or 3 in 20?

21:43.769 --> 21:45.908
1 in 10 for the Chief and me.

21:47.573 --> 21:49.519
Can't stay away from the sheep too long.

21:49.575 --> 21:51.111
They forget who's the shepherd.

22:01.654 --> 22:03.793
So tell me, how is our lady?

22:04.456 --> 22:07.437
Well, it looks a lot worse than it really is.

22:08.127 --> 22:11.006
We lost a couple of 100 hours
on those turbine blades,

22:11.063 --> 22:13.509
but, once we clean off
those jets and fuel lines,

22:13.566 --> 22:15.204
we should be on our way home.

22:15.267 --> 22:16.905
What about our weapons?

22:17.803 --> 22:19.942
Well, no guarantees there.

22:20.239 --> 22:23.379
Hawke, Santini, this is Bowden.

22:23.809 --> 22:25.413
This is Bowden.

22:25.511 --> 22:26.888
Mr. Hawke,

22:27.313 --> 22:30.226
Mr. Santini, hello, is
anybody out there, please?

22:30.549 --> 22:33.496
Please, does anybody read me? Mr. Hawke?

22:33.819 --> 22:35.298
Mr. Santini, this is Bowden.

22:35.588 --> 22:36.896
This is Hawke.

22:36.956 --> 22:39.459
This is Bowden. Please come to
the station. Come to the station.

22:39.525 --> 22:40.595
Please, quick.

22:49.068 --> 22:51.708
He was… he was one of the looters.

22:51.770 --> 22:54.011
- Easy, easy, easy.
- He was one of the looters.

22:54.607 --> 22:55.881
What's your name?

22:55.941 --> 22:57.943
- Nick Cranovich.
- Let me have that.

22:58.010 --> 22:59.614
I was not looting.

22:59.678 --> 23:02.181
Once the eruption came, I ran
to the emergency lockers

23:02.248 --> 23:04.057
for blankets and food and lights.

23:04.116 --> 23:06.596
But they hadn't stocked
‘em. They ripped us off.

23:06.652 --> 23:09.064
That's what those people
were taking from the Store.

23:09.121 --> 23:10.725
Blankets and food,

23:10.789 --> 23:12.564
what was rightly theirs.

23:14.894 --> 23:16.464
Is that true?

23:20.966 --> 23:22.502
Well, is it?

23:23.469 --> 23:25.710
I don't make the rules, Mr. Hawke.

23:26.305 --> 23:27.875
You brought my wife here.

23:28.674 --> 23:30.017
She's asleep.

23:30.075 --> 23:33.215
But first, what about that heater?

23:34.013 --> 23:37.085
The company never gives
enough electricity to heat.

23:37.149 --> 23:39.686
We have to buy the heaters
from the Company Store.

23:39.752 --> 23:43.097
And then if you're sick, or your
quota drops, they take ‘em back.

23:43.155 --> 23:45.658
Never mind that it's cold,
or your wife's pregnant.

23:45.724 --> 23:48.170
They take ‘em back and they sell ‘em again.

23:48.227 --> 23:51.470
At a special price, to one
of the special people.

23:51.630 --> 23:53.837
Like the wife of the General Manager.

23:56.101 --> 23:57.171
Nick?

23:57.236 --> 23:59.375
Look, arrest me if you want.

23:59.905 --> 24:01.851
But let me see her for a few minutes.

24:02.341 --> 24:04.412
We'll talk about it later.

24:06.745 --> 24:07.917
Well,

24:09.081 --> 24:10.321
what about it?

24:10.382 --> 24:13.226
Repossession? In the middle of winter?

24:14.820 --> 24:17.096
That's the way it is up here. I…

24:17.523 --> 24:19.196
I don't like it.

24:19.858 --> 24:21.895
That makes 3 of us, Mr. Bowden.

24:23.095 --> 24:24.870
We need Dr. Fisher.

24:25.097 --> 24:26.542
Where is he? I'll get him.

24:26.598 --> 24:28.134
Did you check the jail?

24:28.434 --> 24:29.435
Jail?

24:29.501 --> 24:31.606
They arrested him yesterday, at the ceremony.

24:31.737 --> 24:33.375
If he's not in his office, he must be there.

24:33.439 --> 24:35.214
Well, I checked the jail. It was empty.

24:35.274 --> 24:36.514
Oh, no.

24:37.876 --> 24:40.755
Those 3 people that were arrested yesterday,

24:40.813 --> 24:41.985
they wouldn't put ‘em in the jail,

24:42.047 --> 24:44.357
just in case Mrs. Davenport
wanted to inspect it.

24:44.416 --> 24:45.656
What're you talk’n about?

24:45.718 --> 24:47.288
Where did they put them?

24:48.253 --> 24:52.099
Well, I heard one of men say
something about Number 7.

24:52.891 --> 24:54.393
My God!

24:54.793 --> 24:56.830
What? What's Number 7?

24:57.062 --> 24:59.008
A tunnel condemned a year ago.

24:59.098 --> 25:02.307
It could never stand these
tremors. You show ‘em where!

25:02.735 --> 25:04.339
I gonna get the rest of the miners.

25:04.403 --> 25:06.212
All right. Come on. Come on.
Come on. Come on. Come on.

25:13.012 --> 25:14.514
This is it.

25:19.952 --> 25:21.625
Anybody in there?

25:22.554 --> 25:24.431
Anybody in there?

25:27.426 --> 25:29.269
Hand me that iron bar.

25:40.706 --> 25:42.276
Here, take this.

25:50.315 --> 25:52.317
Whaddya see, String?

25:53.552 --> 25:56.465
It's caved in. Completely sealed.

25:56.522 --> 25:58.331
Anybody in here?

25:58.524 --> 26:00.162
Is there anybody in here?

26:00.259 --> 26:01.738
It's totally blocked, fellas.

26:01.794 --> 26:03.205
It's hopeless.

26:03.262 --> 26:04.741
You can sure tell you're not a miner, pal.

26:04.797 --> 26:06.435
That's a word we don't know around here.

26:06.498 --> 26:08.375
String, you watch yourself, you hear?

26:12.938 --> 26:14.474
Better hurry…

26:20.212 --> 26:22.624
Get some timber over here. I got
a weak spot coming on right now.

26:39.298 --> 26:40.606
String!

26:42.701 --> 26:43.975
String!

26:46.839 --> 26:48.079
String!

26:55.914 --> 26:58.758
Nick! Nick, can you hear me?

26:59.017 --> 27:01.293
Can anybody hear me in there?

27:01.653 --> 27:03.530
You guys, get in here. We found ‘em!

27:03.589 --> 27:05.000
Cranovich!

27:08.026 --> 27:09.027
Come on!

27:10.762 --> 27:11.900
What about you?

27:11.964 --> 27:13.500
Go! Go! Go!

27:13.599 --> 27:15.408
All right, everybody. Come on.

27:15.467 --> 27:17.378
Everybody, let's go, here we go.

27:17.436 --> 27:18.779
Everybody out.

27:24.176 --> 27:27.180
I got it. Get the hell outta here. Get go’n!

27:31.817 --> 27:33.922
Are you okay?

27:48.734 --> 27:50.736
I never did find a chance to thank you

27:50.802 --> 27:52.748
for saving our lives in that horrible place.

27:52.804 --> 27:56.081
Don't thank me. Thank
String and Nick Cranovich.

27:56.141 --> 27:58.553
They're the ones that did the saving, Mrs…

27:58.610 --> 28:00.647
Miss Mary Avery.

28:00.712 --> 28:03.716
I am grateful like I say, but
there’s someth’n I gotta ask.

28:04.116 --> 28:07.063
Just where do you come from
and whose side are you on?

28:09.955 --> 28:11.662
You know, Miss Avery,

28:11.723 --> 28:15.227
Dom and I, we just sort of
backed into this situation.

28:15.327 --> 28:17.204
I think we'd like to ask you a question.

28:18.797 --> 28:22.074
Just what was it that you did
that got you put in jail?

28:24.970 --> 28:29.385
I drive a 40-ton ore truck for Davenport.

28:29.908 --> 28:32.946
I drove for 3 years before
I committed the ultimate sin,

28:33.011 --> 28:35.048
I questioned company policy.

28:35.113 --> 28:37.957
I asked why the Company Store
rates were so stringent.

28:38.016 --> 28:41.156
I asked why the basic safety and
housing needs of the miners

28:41.220 --> 28:42.494
were being ignored.

28:42.554 --> 28:46.400
They forgave me all that. But when Doc
Fisher and I here discovered that

28:46.825 --> 28:49.772
the health and pension plan was
being systematically ripped off

28:49.828 --> 28:51.808
and planned to tell Mrs. Davenport to her face,

28:51.863 --> 28:56.642
why, that's when John Cove and his private
police force decided we'd gone far enough.

28:57.869 --> 28:59.974
And for that they put you in the slammer?

29:01.506 --> 29:02.780
That's right.

29:03.041 --> 29:04.952
'Course they would have
let us go in a couple of days.

29:05.010 --> 29:07.991
No charge, no trial, just,
"Let that be a lesson."

29:08.347 --> 29:10.349
I'm sorry, but I don't get it.

29:10.682 --> 29:14.687
If this is such a hellhole, and you
didn't even get your basic rights,

29:14.753 --> 29:17.962
then why didn't you all pull up
stakes and get the hell outta here?

29:19.524 --> 29:21.470
You should ask Nick that question.

29:21.860 --> 29:24.773
He left, went down to Cold
River, looking for work.

29:24.830 --> 29:28.141
No seniority. No money in the
bank to tide his family over.

29:28.200 --> 29:31.443
And inside of a week he was
back begging for his old job.

29:31.503 --> 29:35.280
You see, mining isn't exactly
a growth industry right now.

29:35.340 --> 29:36.648
Young people, it's easy to split.

29:36.708 --> 29:39.018
But you start a family and they've got ya.

29:39.077 --> 29:41.580
You make waves, you go under.

29:43.749 --> 29:46.423
I can hardly imagine you mak’n waves.

29:47.886 --> 29:52.164
Without waves there’s no tide or change.

30:01.833 --> 30:03.073
What happened?

30:04.636 --> 30:06.081
Let's get her out.

30:10.242 --> 30:12.483
Easy.

30:13.679 --> 30:18.560
It took us 24 hours just to get this far.

30:18.817 --> 30:19.887
Oh, no.

30:19.951 --> 30:21.453
There are good men and women inside.

30:21.520 --> 30:23.329
I don't want her in there
contaminat’n the place.

30:23.388 --> 30:24.662
This lady's hurt.

30:24.723 --> 30:26.566
There are a lotta people hurt!

30:26.625 --> 30:29.003
There are a lotta people dead from
accidents and hurry-up schedules.

30:29.061 --> 30:30.665
Listen to me.

30:30.829 --> 30:34.641
Any person that's injured has
a right to medical attention.

30:35.334 --> 30:38.941
I know my friend and I are strangers
here, and we've had some tense moments.

30:39.204 --> 30:41.707
But so far, only one person has died.

30:42.174 --> 30:45.678
Now, if you deny her medical
aid, you all are responsible.

30:45.744 --> 30:46.882
That's a fact.

30:46.945 --> 30:49.050
Maybe you should be working for Chief Crammins.

30:49.114 --> 30:52.561
That's a pretty cheap shot from
somebody who speaks like a leader.

30:53.018 --> 30:55.328
Here we go. Just let her
through there. That's it.

30:55.387 --> 30:57.298
This lady doesn't feel well. Clear the way.

30:57.356 --> 30:59.996
- Bring her in here. Come on.
- Oh, hold on.

31:00.058 --> 31:01.867
Doc, you wanna give us a hand?

31:01.927 --> 31:04.237
I only ask you not to
deny her medical attention.

31:04.996 --> 31:07.033
I never said you couldn't speak your mind.

31:07.733 --> 31:09.076
Come on.

31:36.728 --> 31:38.537
Why do you hate me?

31:39.331 --> 31:42.471
Hate you? Woman, I don't even know you.

31:43.702 --> 31:46.546
That's not the way it looked out there.

31:48.273 --> 31:51.880
In church we were taught,
“Hate the deed, not the doer.”

31:52.310 --> 31:53.812
Is the money that important

31:53.879 --> 31:57.053
that the profits must come in the
form of these folks' broken lives?

31:57.616 --> 32:00.187
Miss, uh, Avery?

32:00.852 --> 32:02.195
Avery.

32:03.088 --> 32:04.761
Well, Miss Avery,

32:05.991 --> 32:09.404
my husband was a mine engineer.

32:09.461 --> 32:10.633
And we…

32:11.897 --> 32:16.039
we lived in many small towns such as this.

32:16.835 --> 32:18.246
And he…

32:18.303 --> 32:22.752
we worked very hard to
build up Davenport Mining.

32:23.642 --> 32:26.885
And not on the backs of our employees.

32:28.513 --> 32:31.221
Well, that was then. This is now.

32:31.483 --> 32:35.522
I was locked up and almost killed
to keep me from talk’n to you.

32:36.021 --> 32:39.366
Well, you're talking to me now.

32:44.763 --> 32:46.470
Guess I am.

33:16.127 --> 33:17.538
Mr. Cove.

33:19.364 --> 33:22.868
Mrs. Davenport, I'm so glad
that you're all right.

33:22.934 --> 33:26.609
When that mountain blew up, I thought,
well, you might still be on the road.

33:26.671 --> 33:28.844
I never did get back to Denver.

33:28.907 --> 33:32.582
But when I do go back, I'm taking
some of these people with me.

33:33.678 --> 33:35.919
I'm taking this one, she's under arrest.

33:35.981 --> 33:37.358
Don't you touch her!

33:37.415 --> 33:38.723
I don't know how she got away, but…

33:38.783 --> 33:39.955
I let her out.

33:40.018 --> 33:41.588
We got her out!

33:42.354 --> 33:44.459
From the hole you had her buried in.

33:44.523 --> 33:45.729
Who the hell are you?

33:45.790 --> 33:47.269
Where's Officer Hadene?

33:47.726 --> 33:49.205
He's dead.

33:49.427 --> 33:51.373
He died in the eruption.

33:51.796 --> 33:54.970
Get your hand off me, or
I'll bust you for assault.

33:57.402 --> 33:58.710
Easy.

34:00.205 --> 34:02.515
You're making a mistake, whoever you are.

34:02.574 --> 34:05.817
Chief Crammins is the Law Enforcement
Officer of this township.

34:05.877 --> 34:07.220
Appointed by you.

34:07.279 --> 34:09.657
You're risk’n a felony, All of ya.

34:09.714 --> 34:11.853
We'll let the State Police worry about that.

34:11.917 --> 34:15.194
Once they look over this phony's record of…

34:15.253 --> 34:18.632
false arrests and… improper imprisonment,

34:18.889 --> 34:21.130
I don't think they'll mind
a little arm-bending.

34:21.192 --> 34:22.295
Cove…

34:22.893 --> 34:24.237
Outside.

34:27.331 --> 34:31.337
However, what you've been
doing cannot be overlooked.

34:32.103 --> 34:36.813
You've been getting an earful
from the local radicals, I see.

34:36.875 --> 34:38.320
Quite.

34:38.376 --> 34:42.016
I cheat them in the Store, I work
them too hard. Their homes are cold.

34:42.080 --> 34:44.185
There were no emergency supplies.

34:44.248 --> 34:47.389
People survived the eruption, but
almost died because of your greed.

34:47.452 --> 34:49.955
You've been loot’n the pension and health fund.

34:50.021 --> 34:52.661
You're through with this company, Mr. Cove.

34:52.724 --> 34:56.069
And I want you off the
property within 12 hours.

34:57.596 --> 34:59.735
That's… that's it?

35:01.666 --> 35:05.842
You think I'm some mid-level
Denver flunky you can intimidate?

35:06.037 --> 35:08.677
I was raised in these mines, lady.

35:09.107 --> 35:11.815
I've worked as hard as any man in my time.

35:11.876 --> 35:14.379
But I always knew who my boss was.

35:17.916 --> 35:20.396
My boss is the Board of Directors.

35:23.254 --> 35:26.292
And what they see is a
copper mine turn’n a profit

35:26.358 --> 35:28.531
while all the others are going down the tubes.

35:28.593 --> 35:32.973
Now, you try to fire me, you'll
be the one with 12 hours to pack!

35:35.700 --> 35:36.906
Dear thing.

35:40.672 --> 35:43.585
Do you guys want a job? We can talk.

35:54.119 --> 35:55.598
Is he right?

35:57.188 --> 35:58.929
I don't know.

36:31.256 --> 36:33.031
I feel terrible.

36:34.726 --> 36:36.728
What's happened to me?

36:37.095 --> 36:39.541
I used to have nerves of steel.

36:40.932 --> 36:42.434
You're just a little older, that's all.

36:42.500 --> 36:44.537
That shouldn't matter.

36:44.602 --> 36:46.013
I say

36:46.071 --> 36:48.278
just get in there and start kicking some shins!

36:48.339 --> 36:50.148
Don't let’m intimidate you.

36:50.208 --> 36:52.313
When you get back to Denver,

36:52.377 --> 36:54.618
and you're on your own home turf,

36:55.480 --> 36:57.619
that's when you nail’m.

36:58.016 --> 36:59.222
I…

36:59.784 --> 37:01.627
I hope that's true.

37:02.053 --> 37:04.499
But the company is mine in name only.

37:04.823 --> 37:09.738
My stock and the stock I control
comes to about a third.

37:11.796 --> 37:13.298
And Mr. Cove is right.

37:13.364 --> 37:16.834
They like him back there,
all the profits he's making.

37:17.502 --> 37:18.879
Off of our backs.

37:18.937 --> 37:20.780
I wish you could tell them that.

37:25.243 --> 37:28.554
What, that limo isn't big enough for 2?

37:30.515 --> 37:31.858
I'll go.

37:33.651 --> 37:36.689
And I'd be very proud to have you with me.

37:38.523 --> 37:40.764
But, without positive proof,

37:41.192 --> 37:43.798
especially the pension fraud,

37:43.928 --> 37:46.169
I feel just helpless.

37:47.298 --> 37:48.800
Excuse me.

37:49.768 --> 37:53.147
But would there be room
in that limo for 2 more?

37:54.205 --> 37:55.513
Mr…

37:55.573 --> 37:57.746
Bowden, Chief Accountant.

37:58.476 --> 38:01.548
I'll need the extra seat for my books.

38:29.908 --> 38:31.546
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

38:45.190 --> 38:47.670
She left back to Denver in the limo.

38:47.725 --> 38:48.897
Let her go.

38:48.960 --> 38:50.633
Bowden was with her. He took the ledgers.

38:51.062 --> 38:54.043
Get on the radio, bring the choppers in. Now!

38:59.737 --> 39:01.717
Slowly, communications and travel

39:01.773 --> 39:03.411
in the Northwest are returning to normal

39:03.474 --> 39:05.818
after the devastating
eruption of Mount Catherine.

39:05.877 --> 39:08.380
Downwind areas are still
deeply affected by dust,

39:08.446 --> 39:10.790
but even the most remote
areas are reporting in now

39:10.849 --> 39:13.090
with surprisingly low loss of life.

39:33.905 --> 39:36.181
We're up and away.

39:36.608 --> 39:39.316
We may not have turbo power
but we're flying home.

39:39.644 --> 39:41.214
Good work, Dom.

39:41.312 --> 39:44.521
Don't thank me. Thank her,
baby. She's a sturdy bird.

39:45.149 --> 39:47.356
Mr. Hawke! Mr. Santini!

39:47.418 --> 39:48.897
Where are you guys?

39:48.953 --> 39:50.591
Can anybody hear me?

39:50.889 --> 39:53.028
Over here. It's me, Cranovich!

39:53.391 --> 39:55.701
- Where are you guys?
- Over here!

39:58.630 --> 40:01.770
Mr. Cove and Chief Crammins,
they just took off.

40:01.866 --> 40:04.312
I think they're trying to stop Mrs. Davenport.

40:06.137 --> 40:07.741
What is that?

40:07.805 --> 40:10.217
That's our aircraft.

40:11.542 --> 40:12.612
Looks fast.

40:14.078 --> 40:17.355
I hope it's faster than
the Chief's, for her sake.

40:17.815 --> 40:20.295
Come on, Dom. Here, take the car.

40:30.328 --> 40:34.902
Well, let's hope the lady's got enough
juice to get a normal start here.

40:36.501 --> 40:39.914
Come on, baby. Let's go. Come on.

41:03.995 --> 41:06.168
That's my sweetheart.

41:06.397 --> 41:09.139
I knew she wouldn't let us down, String.

41:32.390 --> 41:36.167
These ledgers make for very
interesting reading, Mr. Bowden.

41:36.427 --> 41:39.897
And they prove all of the
accusations against Cove.

42:17.135 --> 42:18.944
No, no, no. Don't go down there.

42:21.239 --> 42:22.741
We got ‘em now. Move in.

42:25.943 --> 42:27.650
It's a trap, we can't turn around

42:27.712 --> 42:29.453
till we reach the bottom of the pit.

42:42.794 --> 42:44.967
That limo must have come along this road.

42:45.063 --> 42:46.667
What if they get caught out in the open?

42:46.731 --> 42:50.110
I've got explosions, a
pair of ‘em, bearing 345.

43:03.314 --> 43:06.090
Come on, you guys, stop
play’n around. Nail her!

43:07.151 --> 43:10.826
Okay, Mr. Cove. This one is triple bull's eye.

44:05.143 --> 44:07.089
It was 3 against 1,

44:07.178 --> 44:09.454
and I mean, you know what
a good pilot Jonesy is.

44:09.547 --> 44:11.549
- And this big black chopper just…
- It was stupendous.

44:11.616 --> 44:14.028
We would have been buried at
the bottom of Pit Number I

44:14.085 --> 44:15.621
if it hadn't come along.

44:16.020 --> 44:19.832
I'd certainly like to thank those
gentlemen that flew the plane if…

44:20.124 --> 44:22.161
Come on over here and look.
Everyone's leaving. Come on!

44:22.426 --> 44:24.906
only I knew who they were.

44:27.198 --> 44:29.769
Hi. We just wanted to say goodbye.

44:30.268 --> 44:34.375
You know, Mrs. Davenport, I bet they
already know how grateful we are.

44:36.240 --> 44:38.413
Say,
how's Nick's wife?

44:38.476 --> 44:40.285
We understand she went into labor.

44:40.344 --> 44:42.153
Oh, we're wait’n for him right now.

44:42.780 --> 44:44.782
And I must get back to Denver.

44:44.849 --> 44:48.422
I have a recommendation
to make to fill Cove's job.

44:48.486 --> 44:51.365
Someone with a working conscience, we hope.

44:51.656 --> 44:53.932
Oh, yes, yes indeed.

44:54.058 --> 44:58.336
You know, my husband had a
good friend who was a miner,

44:58.629 --> 45:01.132
who knew the real condition of things.

45:01.399 --> 45:05.347
And he insisted that that man
serve on the Board of Directors

45:05.403 --> 45:07.405
as a Member at Large.

45:07.538 --> 45:10.109
And everybody listened to him.

45:10.474 --> 45:13.614
And I think it's time for Davenport Mining

45:13.678 --> 45:15.885
to have that type of voice again.

45:17.014 --> 45:18.493
Oh no, wait a minute.

45:18.549 --> 45:20.756
I'm not what you're looking
for. I'm not a manager…

45:20.818 --> 45:23.731
Now please, don't tell me after
all we've been through together,

45:23.788 --> 45:25.734
you still look on me as the enemy.

45:25.790 --> 45:27.201
No, but I…

45:27.458 --> 45:29.460
I couldn't boss people around.

45:29.994 --> 45:32.998
You know very well that you don't boss anyone.

45:33.764 --> 45:35.801
But you can lead them.

45:38.936 --> 45:39.971
Thank you.

45:40.037 --> 45:41.311
Look!

45:43.374 --> 45:46.548
Nick. What's the matter? You look a little…

45:47.111 --> 45:48.784
Is everything okay?

45:49.013 --> 45:50.492
How's your wife?

45:50.748 --> 45:52.193
She's fine.

45:52.250 --> 45:54.196
They're fine, they're all fine.

45:54.652 --> 45:56.097
All?

45:56.787 --> 46:00.166
Betty and Laura and Nick Jr.

46:00.591 --> 46:01.934
Triplets?
