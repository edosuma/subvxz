00:05.673 --> 00:06.140
.

00:06.174 --> 00:07.075
- In the criminal justice
system,

00:08.142 --> 00:09.143
sexually based offenses

00:09.177 --> 00:11.545
are considered
especially heinous.

00:11.579 --> 00:14.182
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:14.215 --> 00:16.117
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:16.150 --> 00:17.385
are members of an elite squad

00:17.418 --> 00:19.453
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:19.487 --> 00:21.522
These are their stories.

00:22.590 --> 00:25.159
all: * Happy birthday

00:25.193 --> 00:28.329
* Dear Lawrence

00:28.362 --> 00:34.535
* Happy birthday to you

00:34.568 --> 00:37.438
[clapping and cheers]

00:37.471 --> 00:38.639
- What a treat.

00:38.672 --> 00:40.141
Oh, and the cake too.

00:40.174 --> 00:41.142
[laughter]

00:41.175 --> 00:41.942
- Speech!

00:41.975 --> 00:43.411
crowd: Yeah.
- Ah, if you insist.

00:43.444 --> 00:44.378
- Speech!
[clapping]

00:44.412 --> 00:45.579
- Age is just a number.

00:45.613 --> 00:48.382
I'm feeling younger than ever.

00:48.416 --> 00:50.484
And because of many of you

00:50.518 --> 00:53.421
Avalon Stores
is also young,

00:53.454 --> 00:55.489
with a brilliant future ahead.

00:55.523 --> 00:57.591
[clapping]

00:57.625 --> 01:00.528
While I know the company
will someday

01:00.561 --> 01:03.531
be put into the capable hands

01:03.564 --> 01:06.434
of my lovely daughter,
Cynthia,

01:06.467 --> 01:09.637
I'm not planning on dying
anytime soon.

01:09.670 --> 01:10.638
[mild laughter]

01:10.671 --> 01:13.107
Maybe not ever.
What?

01:13.141 --> 01:14.442
[laughter]

01:14.475 --> 01:15.643
Please, enjoy.

01:15.676 --> 01:17.278
[indistinct chatter]
- Cheers.

01:17.311 --> 01:18.312
- We gotta talk.

01:18.346 --> 01:20.214
All right, so these,
these girls,

01:20.248 --> 01:21.849
Sue Ann okay with that?

01:21.882 --> 01:23.251
- Hey, hey.

01:23.284 --> 01:25.153
It's your grandfather's
birthday, Eric.

01:25.186 --> 01:26.654
He deserves
to have a little fun.

01:26.687 --> 01:28.156
[both chuckle]

01:30.358 --> 01:32.126
- Sue Ann is very understanding.

01:32.160 --> 01:36.197
- So you want to introduce me
to--to one of them?

01:36.230 --> 01:38.232
- Let me do you a favor
and not.

01:38.266 --> 01:39.900
Find your own.

01:39.933 --> 01:41.902
Build up your confidence.

01:41.935 --> 01:43.571
Oh, and, uh,

01:43.604 --> 01:46.240
go easy on the spirits.

01:46.274 --> 01:49.210
Always stay sharper
than your target.

01:49.243 --> 01:50.211
Okay?
- All right.

01:50.244 --> 01:51.479
- [soft chuckle]
- All right.

01:51.512 --> 01:53.414
[indistinct chatter]

02:02.390 --> 02:04.258
Hi.

02:04.292 --> 02:06.227
- Can I help you?

02:06.260 --> 02:08.929
- Um.

02:08.962 --> 02:12.300
You're just--you're so pretty,
I just forgot my pick-up line.

02:12.333 --> 02:13.401
- [chuckles]
Cute.

02:13.434 --> 02:14.902
Uh, but I'm working right now.

02:14.935 --> 02:17.171
Can I get you a drink?

02:19.340 --> 02:21.242
[laughs]
Come on.

02:21.275 --> 02:22.576
You really live here?

02:22.610 --> 02:24.645
- Yeah.
Lawrence is my grandfather.

02:24.678 --> 02:26.680
He's kind of mentoring me.

02:26.714 --> 02:28.516
- It's a nice place
to be mentored.

02:28.549 --> 02:30.584
- Yeah, well,
I could show you around.

02:30.618 --> 02:31.919
It's sick.

02:31.952 --> 02:34.622
What, are you worried
about your boss?

02:34.655 --> 02:35.689
- No, he's probably

02:35.723 --> 02:37.258
on the roof, smoking weed.

02:37.291 --> 02:40.694
- What the hell, have a drink.

02:40.728 --> 02:42.330
- Okay.
- Hey--

02:42.363 --> 02:43.431
no, no, no.

02:43.464 --> 02:46.434
No, you don't--
you don't want that.

02:46.467 --> 02:49.503
I got the good stuff
from downstairs.

02:49.537 --> 02:51.772
It's 100% agave.

02:51.805 --> 02:53.574
You can't buy it in the stores.

02:53.607 --> 02:57.411
You're gonna love it.

02:57.445 --> 02:59.480
- Whoa!

03:36.384 --> 03:37.485
- All right, looks good.

03:37.518 --> 03:39.553
- Fin still at home, cramming
for the sergeant's exam?

03:39.587 --> 03:40.788
- Yep.
- I should go over there later.

03:40.821 --> 03:41.655
Drill him.
- No, no.

03:41.689 --> 03:42.723
He says he has
a sleep-learning system.

03:42.756 --> 03:45.493
He plays tapes with a speaker
under his pillow.

03:45.526 --> 03:47.695
- He's kidding, right?
- I don't know.

03:50.531 --> 03:51.665
- Uh--

03:51.699 --> 03:52.766
- Hi.

03:52.800 --> 03:54.468
I'm Lieutenant Benson.
Can I help you?

03:54.502 --> 03:57.037
- Um, I'm not sure.

03:57.070 --> 03:59.273
I--

03:59.307 --> 04:00.841
I think I've been raped.

04:00.874 --> 04:02.476
- I'm so sorry.

04:02.510 --> 04:04.011
Can you tell me what happened?

04:04.044 --> 04:05.413
- I--I can't.

04:05.446 --> 04:08.616
I don't remember.
Anything.

04:13.521 --> 04:16.490
[dramatic music]

04:16.524 --> 04:23.531
*

04:59.132 --> 05:02.903
I was bartending this
birthday party for this old guy.

05:02.936 --> 05:03.971
He owns Avalon Stores.

05:04.004 --> 05:05.906
- Lawrence Hendricks?
- Yeah.

05:05.939 --> 05:09.109
I started working as a
cater waiter to pay for school.

05:09.142 --> 05:11.445
His apartment was huge,
and the view was...

05:13.080 --> 05:14.448
That's all I can remember.

05:14.482 --> 05:17.751
- So you don't remember
having sex?

05:17.785 --> 05:18.919
- No.

05:18.952 --> 05:21.755
But when I woke up
this morning

05:21.789 --> 05:24.124
on a couch in the middle
of a living room,

05:24.157 --> 05:26.827
I could tell.

05:26.860 --> 05:28.496
My pants were down,

05:28.529 --> 05:31.031
and I was sore.

05:31.064 --> 05:32.733
And I just ran out of there.

05:32.766 --> 05:35.403
- So, Sarah, your rape kit
did turn up semen

05:35.436 --> 05:37.104
and a little bit of bruising.

05:37.137 --> 05:40.007
- God.
I knew it.

05:40.040 --> 05:42.943
I--I must have been
drugged or something.

05:42.976 --> 05:44.412
- Well, they're doing
your blood work

05:44.445 --> 05:46.714
and urine test now, so.

05:46.747 --> 05:48.115
Did you have anything
to drink, Sarah?

05:48.148 --> 05:49.817
Not that it matters.

05:49.850 --> 05:51.118
- I don't know.

05:51.151 --> 05:53.821
But I'm not supposed
to drink at work.

05:53.854 --> 05:56.824
And even if I did,
it wouldn't make me like that.

05:56.857 --> 05:58.125
- Okay, do you remember
talking to anyone?

05:58.158 --> 05:59.493
Maybe earlier in the evening?

05:59.527 --> 06:00.561
- Not really.

06:00.594 --> 06:03.964
You know, just a bunch
of old guys ordering drinks.

06:03.997 --> 06:06.166
There was one young guy.

06:06.199 --> 06:08.402
And he talked to me.

06:08.436 --> 06:11.104
- Okay, you remember his name?
- Mm-mm.

06:11.138 --> 06:13.073
- Or what he looked like, or?

06:13.106 --> 06:16.043
You said he was young.
How young was he?

06:16.076 --> 06:19.012
- Around my age, maybe.

06:19.046 --> 06:21.449
He smiled a lot.

06:21.482 --> 06:23.451
That's all I can remember.

06:23.484 --> 06:25.886
I--please--God--

06:29.823 --> 06:31.925
- We're looking for a young guy,
it's not Lawrence Hendricks.

06:31.959 --> 06:32.993
He's 75 years old.

06:33.026 --> 06:34.995
- Yeah, but don't you
get to subtract ten years

06:35.028 --> 06:36.096
for every billion dollars
you have?

06:36.129 --> 06:38.966
- Well, he's down
a billion or two from his peak.

06:38.999 --> 06:40.834
Avalon stock is sinking.

06:40.868 --> 06:41.935
You know, Wall Street says that

06:41.969 --> 06:44.472
Hendricks has been staying on
way past his prime.

06:44.505 --> 06:46.073
- But he still has the energy

06:46.106 --> 06:48.476
for "bunga bunga" parties
with Italian models.

06:48.509 --> 06:49.309
That's the guy, right?

06:49.342 --> 06:50.878
- Yeah, wife number four
disapproved.

06:50.911 --> 06:52.012
They got divorced.

06:52.045 --> 06:53.514
It was a nasty lawsuit
over the prenup.

06:53.547 --> 06:55.883
- He's got hot-and-cold
running girlfriends now.

06:55.916 --> 06:59.753
His current live-in is
a Sue Ann Daly.

06:59.787 --> 07:02.222
She's a freelance
communications consultant.

07:02.255 --> 07:04.858
- Okay, so we have
a probable rape

07:04.892 --> 07:07.761
at the home of
a geriatric playboy billionaire

07:07.795 --> 07:09.463
and all our victim remembers

07:09.497 --> 07:11.832
is a young guy
who smiled a lot.

07:11.865 --> 07:13.501
- Where do you want us to start?

07:13.534 --> 07:15.035
- Start at Hendricks' office.

07:15.068 --> 07:17.104
And get a list
of every guy under 30

07:17.137 --> 07:18.539
who was at the party.

07:23.043 --> 07:25.479
- The office didn't handle
the party invitations.

07:25.513 --> 07:27.080
It was Mr. Hendricks'
household.

07:27.114 --> 07:28.549
- Were you there?

07:28.582 --> 07:29.583
- No.

07:29.617 --> 07:31.485
I had a head cold.

07:31.519 --> 07:32.886
- Justine.

07:32.920 --> 07:34.588
- These are detectives,
Mr. Hendricks.

07:34.622 --> 07:36.089
They're asking about your party.

07:36.123 --> 07:38.225
- Sure.

07:38.258 --> 07:39.893
You should come, sweetheart.

07:39.927 --> 07:42.162
I'm sure you'd have a good time.

07:42.195 --> 07:44.031
- Oh, we were
under the impression

07:44.064 --> 07:45.165
that the party was last night.

07:45.198 --> 07:46.634
- Well, of course it was.

07:46.667 --> 07:48.235
- Well, we'd like to
talk to some people

07:48.268 --> 07:49.537
that were at the party
last night.

07:49.570 --> 07:50.538
- Well, I was there.

07:50.571 --> 07:52.640
- Hi.
I'm Cynthia Hendricks.

07:52.673 --> 07:55.008
- Uh, yeah, actually,
do you recognize this woman?

07:55.042 --> 07:57.845
She was bartending last night
at the party.

07:57.878 --> 07:58.946
- Pleasant-looking woman.

07:58.979 --> 08:00.881
- May have ordered
a drink from her. Why?

08:00.914 --> 08:02.249
- Well, she may
have been assaulted.

08:02.282 --> 08:04.518
- At my father's party?
In front of 100 people?

08:04.552 --> 08:05.953
- We're still investigating.

08:05.986 --> 08:08.856
Uh, were there any
young, male guests at the party?

08:08.889 --> 08:11.592
- It was mostly friends,
company executives.

08:11.625 --> 08:13.093
Older crowd.

08:13.126 --> 08:14.294
- And there was Eric.

08:14.327 --> 08:17.565
Uh, but I'm sure
he didn't assault anyone.

08:17.598 --> 08:18.599
He lives with me.

08:18.632 --> 08:20.534
He's a fine boy,
real up-and-comer.

08:20.568 --> 08:21.602
- Eric?

08:21.635 --> 08:23.971
- My grandson, Cynthia's nephew.

08:24.004 --> 08:26.239
In fact, he works
around here as a trainee.

08:26.273 --> 08:27.541
- Here? Now?
- Mm-hmm.

08:27.575 --> 08:30.544
- Yeah, we'd like to
speak with him.

08:30.578 --> 08:32.079
- Yeah, that's--that's Sarah.

08:32.112 --> 08:33.881
We--we hung out for a while.

08:33.914 --> 08:34.982
What--is something wrong?

08:35.015 --> 08:37.084
- She says she was assaulted.

08:37.117 --> 08:38.185
- Assaulted?

08:38.218 --> 08:39.252
- Mm-hmm.

08:39.286 --> 08:41.121
- Eric, you don't have to
talk to these people.

08:41.154 --> 08:42.556
- No, it--it's all right,
Aunt Cynthia.

08:42.590 --> 08:43.624
This is crazy.
What happened?

08:43.657 --> 08:46.994
- What did you and Sarah do
when you hung out, Eric?

08:47.027 --> 08:48.161
- I mean, we--

08:48.195 --> 08:50.263
we went up to my room,
and--and--

08:50.297 --> 08:54.234
we did--we did have sex
but it was totally consensual.

08:54.267 --> 08:56.937
- I think this is a case
where a girl's confused.

08:56.970 --> 08:58.706
Or perhaps she sees
a rich target here.

08:58.739 --> 08:59.873
- Anything's possible.

08:59.907 --> 09:01.074
We're not jumping
to conclusions.

09:01.108 --> 09:02.710
- Uh, not yet.

09:02.743 --> 09:04.344
But something, uh,
something did come up.

09:04.377 --> 09:07.114
We'd actually like to
talk to you down at the station.

09:07.147 --> 09:07.948
Maybe you can help us
clear it up.

09:07.981 --> 09:09.182
- No, Eric,
you do not have to go.

09:09.216 --> 09:11.184
- No, it's--it's all right.

09:11.218 --> 09:13.253
I didn't do anything wrong,
I swear.

09:18.025 --> 09:19.727
Sarah was on quaaludes?

09:19.760 --> 09:21.328
Isn't that some drug
from before I was born?

09:21.361 --> 09:22.663
- No, they're still around,

09:22.696 --> 09:24.632
and we found them
in her system.

09:24.665 --> 09:26.066
Do you have any idea
how they got there?

09:26.099 --> 09:26.934
- No.

09:26.967 --> 09:28.335
- Was she high
when she was with you?

09:28.368 --> 09:30.037
- She seemed fine.

09:30.070 --> 09:31.905
I only saw her take
like two tequila shots.

09:31.939 --> 09:33.741
- Did she pour
those drinks herself?

09:33.774 --> 09:35.943
- I had the flask,
but I drank from it too.

09:35.976 --> 09:37.044
- Okay.

09:37.077 --> 09:38.311
So what happened after that?

09:38.345 --> 09:39.379
- We just started talking,

09:39.412 --> 09:40.547
and then she asked
to see my bedroom.

09:40.580 --> 09:43.016
- And you took that to mean
that she wanted to have sex?

09:43.050 --> 09:44.351
- No, not at first.

09:44.384 --> 09:46.353
We started making out
and she was really into it.

09:46.386 --> 09:48.088
- Did she say "yes"?

09:48.121 --> 09:49.189
- Yeah, she did.

09:49.222 --> 09:51.091
- She said the word?

09:51.124 --> 09:54.094
- Seriously?

09:54.127 --> 09:56.363
[inhales] Well,
I guess my grandfather's right.

09:56.396 --> 09:58.766
You actually do need a
signed contract to kiss a girl.

09:58.799 --> 10:01.201
[knock]
- This is Larry Hendricks,

10:01.234 --> 10:02.936
Eric's father.

10:02.970 --> 10:04.137
- Come on, Eric.
We're leaving.

10:04.171 --> 10:05.639
- He came here voluntarily.

10:05.673 --> 10:07.340
- And now he's leaving
voluntarily.

10:07.374 --> 10:09.109
And you're coming home to me.

10:09.142 --> 10:10.644
You're not going back
to your grandfather's.

10:10.678 --> 10:12.245
- If you and your wife
want to sit in, that's fine.

10:12.279 --> 10:14.047
- My ex-wife is in Italy.

10:14.081 --> 10:17.217
And I'm sure neither of us
wants to be here.

10:17.250 --> 10:19.286
Come on.
Let's go.

10:24.257 --> 10:25.659
- I take it
his grandfather's house

10:25.693 --> 10:27.194
is more fun than his dad's.

10:27.227 --> 10:28.061
Did you get anything?

10:28.095 --> 10:31.098
- Consensual sex.
Denied the drugs.

10:31.131 --> 10:32.232
- Well, we'll see.

10:32.265 --> 10:34.134
Barba's getting us
a search warrant.

10:38.371 --> 10:40.073
- I don't understand.

10:40.107 --> 10:42.242
Should I call Lawrence
or a lawyer?

10:42.275 --> 10:43.243
- That's up to you, Mrs. Daly.

10:43.276 --> 10:44.277
- Which one is Eric's room?

10:44.311 --> 10:45.278
- There.

10:45.312 --> 10:46.346
It used to be my yoga room.

10:46.379 --> 10:48.081
Now it's just a pigsty.

10:51.151 --> 10:52.686
Can someone tell me
what's going on?

10:52.720 --> 10:55.222
- We are investigating
a complaint

10:55.255 --> 10:56.757
made by this woman.

10:56.790 --> 10:57.791
You recognize her?

10:57.825 --> 10:58.625
- I--I don't know.

10:58.658 --> 11:00.060
- She was tending bar here
last night.

11:00.093 --> 11:01.161
- There was a lot of people.

11:01.194 --> 11:03.196
- All right, but do you remember
seeing her with Eric?

11:03.230 --> 11:04.732
- I'm not his babysitter, okay?

11:04.765 --> 11:07.267
I was tired.
I went to bed early.

11:07.300 --> 11:08.769
- Hey, I got some condoms.

11:08.802 --> 11:11.138
I got some...weed.

11:11.171 --> 11:12.272
No flask though.

11:12.305 --> 11:14.074
- You know,
I am gonna call Lawrence.

11:14.107 --> 11:15.442
- Let's keep looking.

11:20.313 --> 11:21.448
- Hey.

11:24.818 --> 11:26.253
- Quaaludes?

11:26.286 --> 11:28.155
- Beats me.
Before my time.

11:28.188 --> 11:29.790
- Let's send them to the lab.

11:32.292 --> 11:34.327
- You found
quaaludes in my blood?

11:34.361 --> 11:36.096
I-I don't even know
what that is.

11:36.129 --> 11:38.465
- Okay, why don't you
come in and have a seat?

11:38.498 --> 11:41.201
Uh, the technical term is
"methaqualone."

11:41.234 --> 11:45.038
It, uh, induces
a euphoric, hypnotic state.

11:45.072 --> 11:47.207
It can cause memory loss.

11:47.240 --> 11:49.042
- Okay, well,
who gave them to me?

11:49.076 --> 11:50.844
- Well, we're not sure yet,
but we do know that

11:50.878 --> 11:53.246
they were found in
Lawrence Hendricks' apartment.

11:53.280 --> 11:55.849
So, Sarah, I'm gonna
show you some photos.

11:55.883 --> 11:56.917
And I'd like you to tell me

11:56.950 --> 11:59.352
if any of these young men
look familiar to you.

12:07.895 --> 12:08.661
- Yeah, he does.

12:08.695 --> 12:10.798
I remember seeing him
at the party.

12:10.831 --> 12:11.832
- Okay.

12:11.865 --> 12:13.867
So this is Eric Hendricks.

12:13.901 --> 12:16.069
That's Lawrence Hendricks'
grandson.

12:16.103 --> 12:18.105
Now, when we spoke earlier,

12:18.138 --> 12:19.539
you told me that you remember

12:19.572 --> 12:21.909
spending time with
a young man who smiled.

12:21.942 --> 12:24.812
Right?
So is it possible

12:24.845 --> 12:28.215
that that young man
is Eric Hendricks?

12:28.248 --> 12:30.350
- Yeah.

12:30.383 --> 12:31.852
Yeah, I definitely
talked to him.

12:31.885 --> 12:34.888
- Okay.
Well, we spoke to him as well.

12:34.922 --> 12:36.323
And he said

12:36.356 --> 12:39.893
that you two
had consensual sex.

12:39.927 --> 12:42.262
- He did?

12:42.295 --> 12:44.832
- Mm-hmm.

12:44.865 --> 12:48.802
- Well, I don't
remember that.

12:48.836 --> 12:50.904
Or anything else,
for that matter.

12:50.938 --> 12:52.172
Okay, is that it?

12:52.205 --> 12:55.408
- No, no, Sarah,
there's one more thing.

12:55.442 --> 12:56.877
Uh...

12:56.910 --> 13:01.114
Sarah, the lab results
came back.

13:01.148 --> 13:02.916
And it showed

13:02.950 --> 13:07.921
two separate semen samples.

13:07.955 --> 13:10.157
- Two samples?

13:12.926 --> 13:14.594
Are you saying that

13:14.627 --> 13:16.864
two men raped me?

13:19.933 --> 13:22.202
This just keeps getting worse.

13:22.235 --> 13:23.403
- I'm so sorry, Sarah.

13:23.436 --> 13:24.838
- Sorry?

13:24.872 --> 13:26.506
Really?

13:26.539 --> 13:29.542
No, why don't you find
the man--

13:29.576 --> 13:31.311
the men--

13:31.344 --> 13:33.380
who did this to me?

13:44.124 --> 13:44.257
.

13:44.291 --> 13:45.258
- Did I see Sarah with--
with, like, anybody else?

13:46.259 --> 13:47.494
What do you mean?

13:47.527 --> 13:49.997
- It means
they have a new suspect.

13:50.030 --> 13:51.498
Have you, uh, moved on

13:51.531 --> 13:53.166
from your baseless charge
against my client?

13:53.200 --> 13:55.035
- No, we found quaaludes
in his room.

13:55.068 --> 13:56.870
- In my room?
That's impossible.

13:56.904 --> 13:59.272
- And Sarah Morrissey
was drugged with quaaludes.

13:59.306 --> 14:01.241
So we can arrest
your client right now.

14:01.274 --> 14:03.643
- But you're not.
You're asking about another man.

14:03.676 --> 14:05.979
- I'm asking your client
to cooperate.

14:06.013 --> 14:08.115
If you had consensual sex
with this woman,

14:08.148 --> 14:09.582
you have nothing to worry about.

14:09.616 --> 14:10.583
- Eric, when you
were with Sarah,

14:10.617 --> 14:12.052
was there anybody else there?

14:12.085 --> 14:13.653
- What do you mean,
like a gang bang?

14:13.686 --> 14:14.888
No.

14:14.922 --> 14:15.989
- Fine.

14:16.023 --> 14:18.091
What was Sarah doing
before she went off with you?

14:18.125 --> 14:20.894
- She just--working,
tending bar.

14:20.928 --> 14:21.995
- And after?

14:22.029 --> 14:23.596
- I don't know,
I just fell asleep.

14:23.630 --> 14:25.198
- You didn't walk her out?
Ask for her number?

14:25.232 --> 14:27.100
- I had more tequila
than she did.

14:27.134 --> 14:29.903
And when I woke up,
she was gone.

14:29.937 --> 14:31.004
- No, she was here,

14:31.038 --> 14:32.305
reporting she'd been raped.

14:32.339 --> 14:34.541
- Not by me.
- Then by who?

14:34.574 --> 14:36.143
You didn't see her
with anybody else...

14:36.176 --> 14:37.277
- No.
- The entire night of the party?

14:37.310 --> 14:38.979
- No.

14:39.012 --> 14:41.081
Look, I-I don't know.
I don't remember.

14:41.114 --> 14:42.215
- Now this kid's got amnesia.

14:42.249 --> 14:44.284
- Or he knows
more than he's saying.

14:44.317 --> 14:46.319
[phone chimes]
Ah, here we go.

14:46.353 --> 14:48.088
Final report on the DNA.

14:48.121 --> 14:49.656
One sample matches Eric.

14:49.689 --> 14:51.124
- No surprise.

14:51.158 --> 14:53.226
- The other sample is a...

14:53.260 --> 14:55.929
familial match
to the first sample.

14:55.963 --> 14:58.999
- Another Hendricks?

14:59.032 --> 15:01.134
Which of Eric's male relatives
were at the party?

15:01.168 --> 15:02.035
- Two that we know of.

15:02.069 --> 15:04.004
Grandfather Lawrence,
the king of Avalon.

15:04.037 --> 15:05.205
- He's pushing 80.

15:05.238 --> 15:08.175
- Yeah, but has a reputation
for being a serial philanderer.

15:08.208 --> 15:11.344
And Eric's father,
Larry Junior, who--

15:11.378 --> 15:14.114
who shut down the first
interrogation of his son.

15:14.147 --> 15:15.949
- To cover his own ass?

15:22.022 --> 15:23.323
- I thought you
worked at Avalon.

15:23.356 --> 15:24.391
You're on the board.

15:24.424 --> 15:27.594
- Well, I run the family's
charitable foundation.

15:27.627 --> 15:29.229
I like to be away from
the business side.

15:29.262 --> 15:31.364
- Your son feels a little
differently though, huh?

15:31.398 --> 15:33.600
I mean, he works with
your father; he lives with him.

15:33.633 --> 15:35.268
- That's under discussion.

15:35.302 --> 15:37.104
Eric should be back in college.

15:37.137 --> 15:39.306
My father doesn't see the point.

15:39.339 --> 15:42.275
Oh, he's not the best influence
on a teenage boy.

15:42.309 --> 15:44.644
- Sounds like you're not
a big fan of the old man.

15:44.677 --> 15:46.613
- You should be a detective
when you grow up.

15:46.646 --> 15:48.281
- Oh, I'll start
practicing right now.

15:48.315 --> 15:51.018
What time did you leave
your father's party?

15:51.051 --> 15:53.186
- I saw the cake,
I had my picture taken,

15:53.220 --> 15:54.754
and I left.

15:54.787 --> 15:56.589
I was home by 9:30.
Why?

15:56.623 --> 15:57.724
- Detective stuff.

15:57.757 --> 16:00.760
I actually have a warrant
for a sample of your DNA.

16:00.793 --> 16:03.030
- From me?
- Mm-hmm.

16:03.063 --> 16:04.697
- Does this mean
you've cleared my son?

16:04.731 --> 16:06.133
- We're still investigating.

16:06.166 --> 16:08.135
You ready?

16:08.168 --> 16:09.269
Open up.

16:10.737 --> 16:12.972
- Here.

16:14.241 --> 16:15.208
- This is harassment.

16:15.242 --> 16:17.610
Ambushing my father
in front of his associates?

16:17.644 --> 16:19.146
- I'm sorr--
we can step outside.

16:19.179 --> 16:20.147
- There's no need for that.

16:20.180 --> 16:21.614
- Okay, fine.
Open up.

16:21.648 --> 16:24.051
- Oh, save your Q-tip.

16:24.084 --> 16:25.718
I had sex with that girl.

16:25.752 --> 16:27.154
- You did?

16:27.187 --> 16:29.022
You didn't mention that before.

16:29.056 --> 16:30.657
- Why should I have?

16:30.690 --> 16:33.326
My sex life is
no one else's business.

16:33.360 --> 16:35.762
Anyway, that girl came on to me.

16:35.795 --> 16:37.064
- Dad, that's enough.

16:37.097 --> 16:38.598
- Yes.

16:38.631 --> 16:41.134
A woman likes a man
who has success,

16:41.168 --> 16:42.735
confidence, power.

16:42.769 --> 16:44.171
- Quaaludes.

16:44.204 --> 16:46.073
- I have no idea
what you're talking about.

16:46.106 --> 16:47.740
- The--the girl at the party,

16:47.774 --> 16:50.343
did she come on to you
before or after,

16:50.377 --> 16:52.712
uh, she had sex
with your grandson?

16:52.745 --> 16:54.081
- I don't see what
the point of all this is.

16:54.114 --> 16:55.182
- Dad, stop talking.

16:55.215 --> 16:57.050
You can take his sample,

16:57.084 --> 16:59.052
but he doesn't have to
answer your questions.

17:04.391 --> 17:06.759
- Okay, so, Sarah,

17:06.793 --> 17:09.162
um, you told me
that you do remember

17:09.196 --> 17:10.763
talking to Eric, right?

17:10.797 --> 17:13.266
So sometimes memory, you know,

17:13.300 --> 17:14.634
comes back in pieces.

17:14.667 --> 17:16.636
So what I'd like to do is just

17:16.669 --> 17:19.206
show you some photos
and see if that

17:19.239 --> 17:21.774
jogs your memory
and anything comes back, okay?

17:21.808 --> 17:24.811
- I-I mean, I remember
that he was nice.

17:24.844 --> 17:28.448
He had a terrible
pick-up line, but...

17:28.481 --> 17:30.717
Oh, I remember this.

17:30.750 --> 17:32.119
He was showing me a bracelet

17:32.152 --> 17:35.088
he got on a trip to Africa,
elephant hair,

17:35.122 --> 17:36.423
trying to impress me.

17:36.456 --> 17:38.791
I already liked him,
and I--

17:38.825 --> 17:41.161
- And you what?

17:41.194 --> 17:42.662
- Well, later,

17:42.695 --> 17:44.297
he wanted to show me

17:44.331 --> 17:47.500
pictures he had taken
while he was there.

17:47.534 --> 17:51.138
And I went to his room.

17:51.171 --> 17:55.342
Now I remember.

17:55.375 --> 17:57.810
We did have sex.

17:57.844 --> 17:59.279
And I--

17:59.312 --> 18:02.815
I wanted to.

18:02.849 --> 18:05.485
- Okay, are you sure?

18:05.518 --> 18:07.820
- Yeah.

18:07.854 --> 18:10.223
Sorry.
[inhales]

18:10.257 --> 18:11.824
How much trouble
did I get him in?

18:11.858 --> 18:13.260
- None, none.

18:13.293 --> 18:16.429
If that's really
the way you remember it.

18:16.463 --> 18:19.799
- I do.

18:19.832 --> 18:21.468
You know, but the other man,

18:21.501 --> 18:24.304
I-I still
don't remember that.

18:24.337 --> 18:27.740
And there is no way
that that was consensual.

18:27.774 --> 18:29.176
Do you know who he is?

18:29.209 --> 18:31.211
- We think that we do.

18:37.584 --> 18:39.519
- No.

18:39.552 --> 18:41.188
That has to be a mistake.

18:41.221 --> 18:42.189
There is no--

18:42.222 --> 18:45.558
there's no way that
I would have slept with him.

18:45.592 --> 18:47.794
I--
- Okay.

18:47.827 --> 18:50.763
So he says that--
that you did have sex,

18:50.797 --> 18:54.167
and--and the DNA does match.

18:54.201 --> 18:56.203
- That is disgusting!

18:56.236 --> 18:58.938
There--I--
I never would have--

18:58.971 --> 19:01.408
there's no way
I would have slept with him.

19:01.441 --> 19:03.410
- Do--do you remember
having a drink with him?

19:03.443 --> 19:05.478
Do you remember talking to him?

19:05.512 --> 19:07.214
- No.

19:07.247 --> 19:11.218
He has to be the one
who drugged me.

19:11.251 --> 19:13.553
But--but you said you found
the drugs in Eric's room.

19:13.586 --> 19:16.423
- It may have been planted.

19:16.456 --> 19:18.958
- By his own grandfather?

19:18.991 --> 19:22.262
- We don't know.

19:22.295 --> 19:24.564
There is a way
that you can help us.

19:35.975 --> 19:37.577
- You were supposed to
come alone.

19:37.610 --> 19:40.213
- Anything you can say to him,
you can say to me.

19:40.247 --> 19:41.914
- Forget it.
This is a waste of time.

19:41.948 --> 19:43.516
- No, it's not.

19:43.550 --> 19:44.917
Look, trust me.

19:44.951 --> 19:46.353
We want to help you.

19:46.386 --> 19:47.520
- What do you want?

19:47.554 --> 19:49.389
A job?
Money?

19:49.422 --> 19:52.525
Look, uh, there's no reason
to have hard feelings.

19:52.559 --> 19:54.327
- No hard feelings?

19:54.361 --> 19:55.528
I don't want money.

19:55.562 --> 19:57.230
- Then why are we here?

19:57.264 --> 19:58.798
- I want an apology.

19:58.831 --> 20:01.934
- Look, I'm sorry you're unhappy
about our romantic encounter,

20:01.968 --> 20:05.572
but these morning-after
regrets are so tacky.

20:05.605 --> 20:08.308
- There was nothing "romantic."

20:08.341 --> 20:09.542
You drugged me.

20:09.576 --> 20:11.411
- You needed to relax.

20:11.444 --> 20:12.412
You should be thanking me.

20:12.445 --> 20:13.413
- Dad.

20:13.446 --> 20:14.514
- For raping me?

20:14.547 --> 20:15.582
- You enjoyed it.

20:15.615 --> 20:17.584
- What is wrong with you?

20:17.617 --> 20:19.386
I was unconscious!

20:19.419 --> 20:22.422
- For god's sakes, Monica,
it's not that big a deal.

20:22.455 --> 20:23.423
- "Monica"? I--

20:23.456 --> 20:26.293
- Dad, we're leaving.

20:26.326 --> 20:28.495
- Lawrence Hendricks,
you're under arrest.

20:28.528 --> 20:29.662
- For what?

20:29.696 --> 20:30.963
- This is entrapment.

20:30.997 --> 20:33.300
- Step aside, ma'am.

20:33.333 --> 20:34.434
- You have the right
to remain silent.

20:34.467 --> 20:35.968
Anything you say
can and will be used

20:36.002 --> 20:37.370
against you in a court of law.

20:37.404 --> 20:39.439
- Hey, buddy,
I'm drowning in women here.

20:39.472 --> 20:40.673
Help me set them straight.

20:40.707 --> 20:41.874
- I'll get right on that.

20:41.908 --> 20:43.009
- You have the right
to an attorney.

20:43.042 --> 20:45.312
If you cannot afford one,
one will be appointed to you.

20:45.345 --> 20:47.547
- Oh, don't worry, dear,
I can afford it.

20:54.854 --> 20:54.987
.

20:55.021 --> 20:55.522
- This is preposterous.

20:56.823 --> 20:58.325
You had nothing on Eric,

20:58.358 --> 21:00.560
so you arrest his grandfather?

21:00.593 --> 21:02.529
- We have Lawrence Hendricks
telling his victim

21:02.562 --> 21:04.697
that he drugged her
before having sex with her.

21:04.731 --> 21:05.932
- On tape.

21:05.965 --> 21:06.966
- My understanding is
that's not what he said.

21:06.999 --> 21:09.869
- Anybody that speaks English
would disagree.

21:09.902 --> 21:12.339
- His daughter speaks English,
and she didn't hear him say

21:12.372 --> 21:14.040
he drugged that girl
without her knowledge.

21:14.073 --> 21:15.775
- I offered, she accepted.

21:15.808 --> 21:17.043
These pills are very popular.

21:17.076 --> 21:18.978
They're everywhere.
- No, they're not.

21:19.011 --> 21:21.948
- Does this girl have
any history of taking drugs?

21:21.981 --> 21:24.351
I mean, she, uh,
we'll find out.

21:24.384 --> 21:25.585
- While you're at it,
why don't you find out

21:25.618 --> 21:28.321
if she has a history of jumping
in the sack with 80-year-olds.

21:28.355 --> 21:30.757
- [chuckles]
I'm 75.

21:30.790 --> 21:32.392
- We know that
she has no aversion

21:32.425 --> 21:34.093
to jumping into bed
with perfect strangers.

21:34.126 --> 21:35.662
I mean, how long had
she known Eric Hendricks

21:35.695 --> 21:38.398
before she went up to his room?

21:38.431 --> 21:40.400
We'll be posting bail
by happy hour.

21:42.769 --> 21:43.970
- That's his defense?
She wanted to be drugged?

21:44.003 --> 21:46.105
- More like she's a
drug-using party girl

21:46.138 --> 21:47.173
who likes old men.

21:47.206 --> 21:49.809
Look, he's a billionaire
with unlimited resources.

21:49.842 --> 21:51.711
He's gonna go after her, hard.

21:51.744 --> 21:53.045
- I know.
But we have a strong case.

21:53.079 --> 21:54.381
Hendricks practically
admitted to

21:54.414 --> 21:55.815
drugging and raping her
on tape.

21:55.848 --> 21:57.750
Not to mention we found
quaaludes in his apartment.

21:57.784 --> 21:58.985
- I just hope that
that's enough.

21:59.018 --> 22:00.052
- [exhales]

22:00.086 --> 22:01.888
No jury is gonna look at
Sarah and then at Hendricks

22:01.921 --> 22:03.690
and believe that
this was consensual.

22:03.723 --> 22:06.626
It's a slam dunk.
Just--[sighs]

22:06.659 --> 22:07.994
- What?

22:08.027 --> 22:09.929
- Hendricks' daughter
just filed a motion

22:09.962 --> 22:12.031
to have her father
declared mentally incompetent.

22:12.064 --> 22:14.100
- What?

22:15.635 --> 22:16.803
[sighs]

22:16.836 --> 22:18.371
He doesn't have dementia.

22:18.405 --> 22:20.840
He may be revolting,
but he's as smart as hell.

22:20.873 --> 22:24.043
- That's exactly why he's
pretending to be incompetent.

22:28.881 --> 22:30.750
- Mr. Barba, are you lost?

22:30.783 --> 22:31.851
This is the civil branch.

22:31.884 --> 22:34.153
- Uh, yes, yes, of course,
I am aware, Your Honor,

22:34.186 --> 22:36.623
I'm sorry, but this petition
has been brought in bad faith

22:36.656 --> 22:38.090
to undermine
a criminal proceeding.

22:38.124 --> 22:40.126
- Your Honor,
Mr. Barba has no standing here.

22:40.159 --> 22:41.861
- He's right about
the bad faith.

22:41.894 --> 22:43.763
She's trying to steal
my company from me.

22:43.796 --> 22:45.965
- Mr. Hendricks,
you'll have your turn.

22:45.998 --> 22:47.099
- Your Honor,
with all due respect,

22:47.133 --> 22:48.868
this proceeding
should be postponed

22:48.901 --> 22:50.036
until after his criminal trial.

22:50.069 --> 22:51.838
- There shouldn't even be
a criminal trial

22:51.871 --> 22:53.039
for a man in his condition.

22:53.072 --> 22:54.140
- You see, this is--
this is exactly

22:54.173 --> 22:55.141
what this is really about.

22:55.174 --> 22:57.143
- It's about
stealing my company!

22:57.176 --> 22:59.178
- Mr. Hendricks, be quiet.

22:59.211 --> 23:00.880
Mr. Barba, you too.

23:00.913 --> 23:01.948
Sit, watch, listen,

23:01.981 --> 23:04.951
or go.

23:04.984 --> 23:07.654
- Mr. Hendricks is
the CEO and majority owner

23:07.687 --> 23:10.457
of a public corporation,
but he is no longer capable

23:10.490 --> 23:11.924
of running the
day-to-day operations

23:11.958 --> 23:13.059
due to mental incapacity.

23:13.092 --> 23:17.129
Ms. Hendricks is his designated
successor and daughter.

23:17.163 --> 23:18.130
There's no question
that she has

23:18.164 --> 23:21.200
his and the company's
best interest at heart.

23:21.233 --> 23:23.002
- You are aware that
you don't get to

23:23.035 --> 23:25.672
declare a person incapacitated
just because

23:25.705 --> 23:27.206
you don't like the way
he's running his business?

23:27.239 --> 23:28.307
- He's not running it.

23:28.340 --> 23:31.010
He ignores all attempts
to focus on company matters.

23:31.043 --> 23:34.013
His behavior is erratic
and even dangerous,

23:34.046 --> 23:36.483
as evidenced by
his arrest for rape.

23:36.516 --> 23:37.850
- Ugh.
- All right.

23:37.884 --> 23:39.118
Mr. Timmons?

23:41.554 --> 23:42.955
- Mr. Hendricks' only goal

23:42.989 --> 23:46.092
is to do what's best
for his shareholders.

23:46.125 --> 23:47.960
- That's all you have to say?

23:47.994 --> 23:48.961
Do something!

23:48.995 --> 23:50.763
- Uh, Your Honor, we request

23:50.797 --> 23:52.832
a full hearing on this matter
as soon as possible

23:52.865 --> 23:55.101
as urgent company business
is pending.

23:55.134 --> 23:57.537
- Very well.
We will proceed.

23:59.038 --> 24:00.139
- This may be a good thing.

24:00.172 --> 24:01.474
- Don't fight me on this, Dad.

24:01.508 --> 24:02.942
It's for the best.

24:08.180 --> 24:10.850
- Judge Flowers,
this is a civil court order

24:10.883 --> 24:12.819
appointing Cynthia Hendricks
guardian of her father,

24:12.852 --> 24:14.253
owing to clear and
convincing evidence

24:14.286 --> 24:16.188
of his mental incapacity.

24:16.222 --> 24:17.156
- So?

24:17.189 --> 24:19.225
- Is that all
you have to say, Mr. Barba?

24:19.258 --> 24:20.993
- That was civil court;
this is criminal.

24:21.027 --> 24:22.495
Different standard,
different issue.

24:22.529 --> 24:23.963
It's no more relevant
to the rape charge

24:23.996 --> 24:26.132
than if Mr. Hendricks
was crowned Miss America.

24:26.165 --> 24:28.568
- Colorful.
Mr. Timmons?

24:28.601 --> 24:30.770
- Uh, we will be changing
our plea from "not guilty"

24:30.803 --> 24:33.139
to "not guilty by reason
of mental disease or defect."

24:33.172 --> 24:35.074
So it might be relevant
after all.

24:38.878 --> 24:40.547
- That's a civil court ruling.

24:40.580 --> 24:42.014
That's lower burden of proof.

24:42.048 --> 24:44.250
I don't understand
how Hendricks can use that

24:44.283 --> 24:45.217
as part of his defense.

24:45.251 --> 24:47.219
- I made the same argument.
Flowers disagreed.

24:47.253 --> 24:49.255
Said it was up to the jury to
determine its probative value.

24:49.288 --> 24:50.923
- Okay.

24:50.957 --> 24:52.792
So what does that mean for us?
- Nothing.

24:52.825 --> 24:54.527
We prove our case
based on the evidence,

24:54.561 --> 24:55.528
just like before.

24:55.562 --> 24:56.796
And as for
Hendricks' new defense,

24:56.829 --> 24:57.764
we chip away at it.

24:57.797 --> 25:00.032
Make the jury see it
for what it is: a sham.

25:00.066 --> 25:02.168
- And a family conspiracy.

25:02.201 --> 25:03.903
Now the daughter gets
what she wants now,

25:03.936 --> 25:05.905
which is control
of the company now

25:05.938 --> 25:07.106
as opposed to
ten years from now.

25:07.139 --> 25:09.008
And the father
gets what he wants,

25:09.041 --> 25:10.309
a free pass on a rape charge.

25:10.342 --> 25:12.044
- It's not gonna happen.

25:12.078 --> 25:13.613
- You seem pretty confident.

25:13.646 --> 25:15.181
- More like angry.

25:15.214 --> 25:16.949
- Even better.

25:21.153 --> 25:22.922
- Look, I'm sorry
you're unhappy

25:22.955 --> 25:24.323
about our romantic encounter,

25:24.356 --> 25:28.194
but these morning-after regrets
are so tacky.

25:28.227 --> 25:31.030
- There was nothing "romantic."
You drugged me.

25:31.063 --> 25:33.933
- Oh, you needed to relax.
You should be thanking me.

25:33.966 --> 25:35.134
- Dad.
- For raping me?

25:35.167 --> 25:37.804
- You enjoyed it.
- What is wrong with you?

25:37.837 --> 25:39.238
I was unconscious!

25:39.271 --> 25:40.239
- Does any of this
jog your memory about

25:40.272 --> 25:42.108
what happened between
you and the defendant

25:42.141 --> 25:43.209
on the night in question?

25:43.242 --> 25:45.011
- No, it's all still blank.

25:45.044 --> 25:48.147
Uh, I get flashes
sometimes, but no.

25:48.180 --> 25:49.181
- Well, that's understandable.

25:49.215 --> 25:50.349
You had quaaludes
in your system.

25:50.382 --> 25:53.019
What about
that conversation in the park?

25:53.052 --> 25:54.954
Did Mr. Hendricks seem aware

25:54.987 --> 25:56.856
of what he had done to you?
- Yes.

25:56.889 --> 25:58.357
I was almost wishing
that he would deny it...

25:58.390 --> 25:59.358
[inhales sharply]

25:59.391 --> 26:00.960
so maybe
it didn't really happen,

26:00.993 --> 26:03.663
but he admitted it.

26:03.696 --> 26:06.365
He tried to buy me off.

26:06.398 --> 26:10.102
And he kept trying to excuse it,

26:10.136 --> 26:11.638
like it was no big deal.

26:11.671 --> 26:13.372
- Was he...
[exhales]

26:13.405 --> 26:15.942
was he rational?
Was he coherent?

26:15.975 --> 26:17.243
- Yes.

26:17.276 --> 26:19.679
Awful, but rational.

26:19.712 --> 26:23.315
- All right, thank you, Sarah.

26:23.349 --> 26:25.652
- Ms. Morrissey,

26:25.685 --> 26:28.254
you said that
Mr. Hendricks seemed to think

26:28.287 --> 26:29.889
that what happened
between the two of you

26:29.922 --> 26:32.258
was--was no big deal?

26:32.291 --> 26:34.126
In other words,
that it was normal?

26:34.160 --> 26:37.630
- Yes.

26:37.664 --> 26:39.666
It was sick.

26:39.699 --> 26:42.134
- Sick.

26:42.168 --> 26:44.937
"Sick."

26:44.971 --> 26:46.405
It's a good choice of words.

26:46.438 --> 26:48.140
Nothing further.

26:52.378 --> 26:54.313
- Considering he wiped
her memory, she did pretty good.

26:54.346 --> 26:55.682
- We've explained
about the quaaludes,

26:55.715 --> 26:57.049
but it's always better
if the jury

26:57.083 --> 26:59.018
hears what happened
from the victim.

26:59.051 --> 27:00.152
- That's Hendricks' trick.

27:00.186 --> 27:02.689
The drug ensured that--
that she wouldn't remember.

27:02.722 --> 27:05.091
- His attitude on that tape,

27:05.124 --> 27:06.693
it's a good bet
he's done this more than once.

27:06.726 --> 27:09.195
- No one's come forward,
and we've looked.

27:11.764 --> 27:14.033
- Hendricks' girlfriend.

27:14.066 --> 27:15.902
She might know his tricks.

27:15.935 --> 27:17.103
- And testify against

27:17.136 --> 27:19.972
the billionaire
she's sponging off of?

27:26.913 --> 27:27.046
.

27:27.079 --> 27:28.080
- You're facing a charge
of tampering with evidence.

27:29.448 --> 27:30.449
- For what?

27:30.482 --> 27:32.752
- Planting
your boyfriend's quaaludes

27:32.785 --> 27:33.986
in his grandson's room

27:34.020 --> 27:36.055
to throw us off
your boyfriend's trail.

27:36.088 --> 27:39.826
Look, an FBI forensic report
just came back.

27:39.859 --> 27:42.361
And your fingerprints
are all over the bag.

27:42.394 --> 27:44.931
- So either tell the truth
or go to prison.

27:44.964 --> 27:46.132
9:00 a.m. tomorrow,

27:46.165 --> 27:48.034
show up ready to testify

27:48.067 --> 27:50.770
or you'll be arrested.

27:50.803 --> 27:52.872
- This is outrageous.

27:59.812 --> 28:01.714
- She did plant
those quaaludes, right?

28:01.748 --> 28:03.716
- She shows up at 9:00 a.m.,
she did.

28:03.750 --> 28:04.817
If not...

28:04.851 --> 28:07.319
- Did you ever get a report
back on the fingerprints?

28:07.353 --> 28:08.955
- It's inconclusive.

28:08.988 --> 28:11.023
- You're very good.

28:14.026 --> 28:16.095
- After I heard
what the girl said,

28:16.128 --> 28:18.330
I took the pills
from Lawrence's bedroom

28:18.364 --> 28:20.499
and I put them in Eric's.

28:20.532 --> 28:22.368
I know it was wrong.

28:22.401 --> 28:24.503
I just--panicked.

28:24.536 --> 28:25.805
- How did you know
the pills would be

28:25.838 --> 28:27.874
in your boyfriend's bedroom?

28:31.043 --> 28:33.746
Ms. Daly?

28:33.780 --> 28:37.183
- He likes to use them
when he has sex.

28:37.216 --> 28:39.485
When we do it,

28:39.518 --> 28:41.187
he puts a quaalude in my drink

28:41.220 --> 28:43.722
and gives it to me.

28:46.425 --> 28:48.127
- With your consent?

28:48.160 --> 28:49.929
- No.

28:52.398 --> 28:55.501
I mean, he tries to hide
what he's doing, but

28:55.534 --> 28:58.504
I know, I--I see.

28:58.537 --> 28:59.972
- No more questions.

29:00.006 --> 29:02.108
Thank you.

29:02.141 --> 29:03.375
- Ms. Daly,

29:03.409 --> 29:05.544
what else do you
and Mr. Hendricks

29:05.577 --> 29:08.514
like to do in your private time?

29:08.547 --> 29:10.783
- We talk,

29:10.817 --> 29:13.019
watch movies,
listen to music.

29:13.052 --> 29:14.520
- Mm, what--what does
Mr. Hendricks

29:14.553 --> 29:15.988
like to talk about?

29:16.022 --> 29:17.156
- Old friends.

29:17.189 --> 29:20.559
People he used to hang out with
in the New York clubs

29:20.592 --> 29:22.194
or the Playboy Mansion.

29:22.228 --> 29:25.197
- Mm, and--and the movies
and the music,

29:25.231 --> 29:26.198
what does he like?

29:26.232 --> 29:29.101
- "The Godfather."

29:29.135 --> 29:31.537
"Jaws."
"Smokey and the Bandit."

29:36.042 --> 29:37.209
- Mr. Hendricks,

29:37.243 --> 29:39.846
can you tell us
what year it is?

29:39.879 --> 29:41.547
- You know what?
[exhales]

29:41.580 --> 29:43.015
I'd rather not say.

29:43.049 --> 29:44.817
- And why is that, sir?

29:44.851 --> 29:48.187
- Well, I keep seeing dates
past the year 2000

29:48.220 --> 29:51.257
on, uh, newspapers,
magazines, and such.

29:51.290 --> 29:54.927
I'm...trying to understand
what's going on.

29:57.596 --> 29:59.832
- So, Mr. Hendricks, uh,

29:59.866 --> 30:01.868
we've heard testimony
here, sir, that

30:01.901 --> 30:04.436
you've given women quaaludes

30:04.470 --> 30:05.938
as a prelude to sex.

30:05.972 --> 30:07.206
- Yes.

30:07.239 --> 30:08.140
- Yes what?

30:08.174 --> 30:11.577
- Ye--those pills
are just thigh openers.

30:11.610 --> 30:14.013
Everybody uses them.
No big deal.

30:14.046 --> 30:15.481
- Even if the women don't know?

30:15.514 --> 30:17.516
- How could they not know?

30:17.549 --> 30:20.887
If they're coming to party,
they know what to expect.

30:20.920 --> 30:22.922
- And there's
a young woman who's, uh,

30:22.955 --> 30:25.457
accusing you of rape.

30:25.491 --> 30:28.094
- I don't--I don't know
what's going on with her.

30:28.127 --> 30:30.997
- And she says you drugged her
without her knowledge.

30:31.030 --> 30:33.199
- After she had sex with Eric,

30:33.232 --> 30:35.567
she was already partying.

30:35.601 --> 30:37.469
They came out of his bedroom.

30:37.503 --> 30:39.105
I had a drink with them.

30:39.138 --> 30:42.074
Eric went to sleep,
and then it was my turn.

30:42.108 --> 30:46.913
- And you see
nothing wrong with that?

30:46.946 --> 30:48.247
- Why should I?

30:48.280 --> 30:51.050
- Thank you.

30:51.083 --> 30:53.119
- Do you ever use
a desktop computer?

30:53.152 --> 30:55.654
- Of course.
Marvelous things.

30:55.687 --> 30:58.657
- You're aware that they
did not exist in 1975?

30:58.690 --> 31:00.626
- What do you mean?
[scoffs]

31:00.659 --> 31:03.963
How do you think we made it
to the moon a few years ago?

31:03.996 --> 31:06.098
- Here's a photo
of Avalon headquarters

31:06.132 --> 31:08.935
in 1975.

31:08.968 --> 31:10.102
Not a computer in sight.

31:10.136 --> 31:11.637
- Oh, the desktop models
came in

31:11.670 --> 31:13.605
just after that photo was taken.

31:13.639 --> 31:15.274
We're a very successful company.

31:15.307 --> 31:17.609
We can afford
the newest technology.

31:17.643 --> 31:21.080
- And you can certainly
afford to expand.

31:21.113 --> 31:25.017
Let's see, in 1975,

31:25.051 --> 31:28.020
Avalon had 22 stores.

31:28.054 --> 31:31.057
And now you have 900.

31:31.090 --> 31:33.259
Uh, are you telling me you're
not aware of the difference?

31:33.292 --> 31:36.062
- Mr. Barba,
if you understood business,

31:36.095 --> 31:39.631
you'd know how rapidly
a successful company can grow.

31:39.665 --> 31:41.633
- From 22 to 900 like...?

31:41.667 --> 31:44.636
- Well, the planning has
been going on for years.

31:44.670 --> 31:48.074
You--you really don't
understand this, do you?

31:48.107 --> 31:50.109
- Do you know what this is?

31:50.142 --> 31:51.377
- A telephone.

31:51.410 --> 31:52.378
- Really?
This looks like

31:52.411 --> 31:54.246
a 1970s telephone to you?

31:54.280 --> 31:56.315
- [chuckling]
My God.

31:56.348 --> 31:59.085
I remember when phones
were attached to the wall.

31:59.118 --> 32:00.286
They had this little,
round dial,

32:00.319 --> 32:02.254
you'd put your finger in
and turn it.

32:02.288 --> 32:03.689
- Back in the '70s.

32:03.722 --> 32:06.025
- Uh, actually, 1950s,

32:06.058 --> 32:09.361
but I may be
a little older than you.

32:09.395 --> 32:12.298
- You're certainly
more experienced, sir.

32:12.331 --> 32:15.301
So, um, the night of,
this, uh, party,

32:15.334 --> 32:17.303
where you gave
Sarah Morrissey quaaludes,

32:17.336 --> 32:18.370
what were you celebrating?

32:18.404 --> 32:20.039
- My birthday.

32:20.072 --> 32:21.373
- Your 75th.
- [chuckles]

32:21.407 --> 32:22.708
That was a gag.

32:22.741 --> 32:24.043
- How old are you?

32:24.076 --> 32:26.045
- As young as I feel.

32:26.078 --> 32:29.982
And...
I feel pretty good.

32:30.016 --> 32:32.618
- One last question.

32:32.651 --> 32:34.653
Are you aware that
drugging and raping women

32:34.686 --> 32:36.688
was illegal in 1975?

32:36.722 --> 32:38.257
- Ob--objection.

32:38.290 --> 32:41.994
- Withdrawn.
[exhales]

32:42.028 --> 32:43.329
Nothing further.

32:47.766 --> 32:50.602
Unfortunately, your
grandfather's insanity defense

32:50.636 --> 32:51.670
seems to be working.

32:51.703 --> 32:53.372
He's a terrific actor.

32:53.405 --> 32:56.075
- You didn't tell us
that you and Sarah

32:56.108 --> 32:59.378
had a late-night drink
with your grandfather.

32:59.411 --> 33:03.115
- If that's true,
it's important information.

33:03.149 --> 33:05.151
It could help prove that
your grandfather drugged Sarah.

33:05.184 --> 33:08.287
- Eric, why are
you protecting him?

33:08.320 --> 33:11.123
- Because he's a good person.
- No.

33:11.157 --> 33:12.758
He isn't.

33:12.791 --> 33:14.360
He's a selfish, disgusting--

33:14.393 --> 33:16.295
- You're just mad
'cause he fired you.

33:16.328 --> 33:18.097
And 'cause my loser mother
had a crush on him.

33:18.130 --> 33:20.466
- What'd you just say?

33:20.499 --> 33:22.801
- I'm just telling you
what Grandpa told me,

33:22.834 --> 33:25.637
that my mom
was a party girl

33:25.671 --> 33:26.738
who liked to have fun.

33:26.772 --> 33:27.739
- Hey, hey, hey.

33:27.773 --> 33:29.175
- Shut your mouth!

33:29.208 --> 33:30.809
You hear me?

33:30.842 --> 33:33.112
Don't you ever talk that way
about your mother.

33:33.145 --> 33:35.281
Ever!

33:35.314 --> 33:36.448
- Fine.

33:36.482 --> 33:39.251
But I'm not testifying
against Grandpa.

33:46.758 --> 33:51.230
- You need help
putting my father away?

34:00.106 --> 34:00.406
.

34:00.439 --> 34:01.440
- Mr. Hendricks, how often
do you see your father?

34:02.274 --> 34:04.476
- Once a month
at Avalon board meetings.

34:04.510 --> 34:05.844
- And at these board meetings,
does he usually

34:05.877 --> 34:07.513
seem to know
what century he's in?

34:07.546 --> 34:09.615
- He's never given
any indication that he doesn't.

34:09.648 --> 34:12.084
- Can you think of any reason
he'd be faking a mental illness?

34:12.118 --> 34:14.720
- Objection.
The witness is not an expert.

34:14.753 --> 34:16.455
- He's an expert on his father.

34:16.488 --> 34:19.525
- Overruled.
The witness may answer.

34:19.558 --> 34:21.460
- Yes, he doesn't
want to go to jail.

34:21.493 --> 34:23.795
- Indeed.

34:23.829 --> 34:25.797
- You are aware, aren't you,

34:25.831 --> 34:28.567
that your father was
recently declared

34:28.600 --> 34:30.536
incapable in a civil proceeding?

34:30.569 --> 34:31.870
- Brought by my sister
so that

34:31.903 --> 34:33.539
she could take over the company.

34:33.572 --> 34:34.706
- Right, right.

34:34.740 --> 34:37.809
She's next in line to run it,
isn't she?

34:37.843 --> 34:39.311
- Yes, she is.

34:39.345 --> 34:41.347
- Yeah, and weren't you
the heir apparent

34:41.380 --> 34:42.414
at one point?

34:42.448 --> 34:43.349
- Objection. Relevance.

34:43.382 --> 34:45.117
- Goes to the credibility
of the witness.

34:45.151 --> 34:46.118
- I'll allow it.

34:46.152 --> 34:47.586
- Mr. Hendricks,
isn't it true that

34:47.619 --> 34:50.356
your father booted you out
of the company a few years ago

34:50.389 --> 34:52.558
and installed your sister
in your place?

34:52.591 --> 34:56.395
And--and you dislike him
for that, don't you?

34:56.428 --> 34:58.430
- He didn't boot me out.
I walked away.

34:58.464 --> 35:00.866
- Really?

35:00.899 --> 35:03.835
Really?
Well--

35:03.869 --> 35:05.571
does this, uh,

35:05.604 --> 35:08.574
newspaper article
from 1996,

35:08.607 --> 35:09.641
does this refresh your memory?

35:09.675 --> 35:11.777
Could--could you, uh--
could you read it, please?

35:11.810 --> 35:14.480
- "Lawrence Hendricks Junior,
pictured here with

35:14.513 --> 35:15.847
"his wife, Monica,
and his father,

35:15.881 --> 35:17.349
"Lawrence Hendricks Senior,

35:17.383 --> 35:18.784
"toasting the younger Hendricks'
appointment

35:18.817 --> 35:21.787
as Chief Operating Officer
of Avalon Stores."

35:21.820 --> 35:23.922
- You were pretty happy there,
weren't you?

35:23.955 --> 35:25.857
- I guess.

35:25.891 --> 35:28.160
- Yeah, and then,
two months later,

35:28.194 --> 35:31.597
you're out, exiled
to the company's foundation.

35:31.630 --> 35:32.631
Do you still insist

35:32.664 --> 35:34.833
that you hold no ill will
towards your father?

35:34.866 --> 35:37.669
- It's not a secret that
I don't like him very much.

35:37.703 --> 35:39.405
- Right, so
you wouldn't mind

35:39.438 --> 35:40.539
seeing him go to jail?

35:40.572 --> 35:41.807
- Objection. Argumentative.

35:41.840 --> 35:42.708
- Withdrawn.

35:42.741 --> 35:45.911
It's very clear
why this witness is here.

35:45.944 --> 35:47.913
- Mr. Hendricks,

35:47.946 --> 35:49.615
why are you here?

35:49.648 --> 35:51.383
- To tell the truth.

35:51.417 --> 35:53.452
- Thank you.

35:58.824 --> 36:00.659
- Mr. Hendricks,

36:00.692 --> 36:02.361
you did tell the truth in there.

36:02.394 --> 36:03.462
- Of course I did.

36:03.495 --> 36:05.964
- But I'm guessing
not the whole truth.

36:05.997 --> 36:07.366
- What are you talking about?

36:07.399 --> 36:08.567
- Well, you tell me.

36:08.600 --> 36:10.436
Your ex-wife's name
is Monica, right?

36:10.469 --> 36:11.503
- Yes. So?

36:11.537 --> 36:13.839
- So you didn't hear the tape,
but when your father

36:13.872 --> 36:15.907
was in the park with Sarah,

36:15.941 --> 36:18.510
at one point he slipped up
and he--

36:18.544 --> 36:20.379
he called her Monica.

36:20.412 --> 36:21.847
- He did?
- Yeah.

36:21.880 --> 36:25.584
Why would he call Sarah,
a woman that he just raped,

36:25.617 --> 36:27.919
by your ex-wife's name?

36:27.953 --> 36:28.987
- A mistake.

36:29.020 --> 36:33.425
- May I ask why you
and your wife got divorced?

36:33.459 --> 36:34.926
Is it--

36:34.960 --> 36:36.762
is it something
that your father did?

36:36.795 --> 36:37.963
- It's none of your business.

36:37.996 --> 36:40.932
- No, but it's
Sarah Morrissey's business.

36:40.966 --> 36:43.402
Your father raped her
and God knows how many

36:43.435 --> 36:44.803
other women he assaulted,

36:44.836 --> 36:48.707
so I think it's
all of their business.

36:48.740 --> 36:51.610
Look, I don't know
if you're embarrassed

36:51.643 --> 36:53.612
or you're guilty
or you're trying

36:53.645 --> 36:55.947
to protect your family name,

36:55.981 --> 36:58.684
but I'm pretty sure

36:58.717 --> 37:01.953
that Eric is trying
to protect his grandfather.

37:01.987 --> 37:05.691
It's time that
you told your son

37:05.724 --> 37:08.727
what kind of man
your father really is.

37:08.760 --> 37:11.630
And maybe that will convince
him to tell the truth.

37:15.634 --> 37:17.936
- He just made a mistake, okay?

37:17.969 --> 37:20.506
I--I didn't see him after
Sarah and I had sex, just--

37:20.539 --> 37:21.540
- Eric,

37:21.573 --> 37:23.442
you lied to the police.

37:23.475 --> 37:25.477
I can charge you
with obstruction.

37:25.511 --> 37:28.847
- Eric,
if you know anything...

37:28.880 --> 37:31.850
- Oh, you want to put
your own father in jail?

37:31.883 --> 37:33.719
You know, I wouldn't
do that to you.

37:33.752 --> 37:36.855
- Maybe I deserve protection.
He doesn't.

37:36.888 --> 37:39.691
- Why, because he enjoys life
a little more than you do?

37:39.725 --> 37:40.859
Or are you still mad
that he gave the company

37:40.892 --> 37:42.027
to Aunt Cynthia and not you?

37:42.060 --> 37:43.729
- I don't give a damn
about the company...

37:43.762 --> 37:44.830
- Come on, Dad.
- Because he's there.

37:44.863 --> 37:45.964
'Cause I have to
see him every day.

37:45.997 --> 37:49.501
- What--what did he
ever do to you?

37:49.535 --> 37:52.037
- He--he didn't do it to me.
He did it to your mother.

37:52.070 --> 37:54.540
- To Mom?
You've been divorced forever.

37:54.573 --> 37:57.776
You never even see her, and he--
he did something to Mom?

37:57.809 --> 37:58.944
- Eric,

37:58.977 --> 38:02.848
when your grandfather sees
somebody younger than he is,

38:02.881 --> 38:05.717
getting somebody prettier
than he gets,

38:05.751 --> 38:08.487
he--he can't stand it.

38:08.520 --> 38:09.855
- What--what is--

38:09.888 --> 38:11.990
what--what is she talking about?

38:12.023 --> 38:14.493
- Your mother was
just pregnant with you.

38:14.526 --> 38:16.795
She was beautiful.

38:16.828 --> 38:17.896
Radiant.

38:17.929 --> 38:20.098
Your grandfather had a party

38:20.131 --> 38:22.000
at the penthouse,

38:22.033 --> 38:25.504
and I got called away.

38:25.537 --> 38:28.640
Emergency at the office.

38:28.674 --> 38:30.876
Your grandfather
gave your mother a drink.

38:30.909 --> 38:32.043
- No.
- A special drink.

38:32.077 --> 38:33.845
- No.

38:33.879 --> 38:37.816
- Your mother and I
never got over it.

38:37.849 --> 38:39.818
That's why we were divorced.
- No.

38:42.588 --> 38:44.690
- Eric,

38:44.723 --> 38:46.792
that's who your grandfather is.

38:58.870 --> 39:02.608
- So after Sarah and I
left the bedroom,

39:02.641 --> 39:05.143
uh, I wanted to walk her out.

39:05.176 --> 39:08.714
My grandfather was
waiting by the bar.

39:10.716 --> 39:12.818
And he had already
made a few drinks.

39:12.851 --> 39:14.953
And he proposed a nightcap.

39:14.986 --> 39:17.055
And I reached for
one of the drinks,

39:17.088 --> 39:19.157
and he said,
"No, not that one."

39:19.190 --> 39:23.795
And, uh, he gave that one
to Sarah.

39:23.829 --> 39:25.397
- Has your grandfather
ever given you

39:25.431 --> 39:26.832
any indication that
he understands

39:26.865 --> 39:29.100
that he's living
in the year 2016?

39:29.134 --> 39:30.602
- Yes.

39:30.636 --> 39:33.004
He--he always says
how he likes having me

39:33.038 --> 39:36.174
around the office because
I understand the new generation,

39:36.207 --> 39:38.644
the post-millennials.

39:38.677 --> 39:40.412
In fact, last month
he asked me to

39:40.446 --> 39:41.880
come up with
a retail promotion

39:41.913 --> 39:43.782
surrounding Pokémon GO.

39:43.815 --> 39:46.084
- And on the night that he
gave Sarah Morrissey that drink,

39:46.117 --> 39:47.953
did he say anything else then?

39:50.021 --> 39:52.924
- Yeah, he winked at me,

39:52.958 --> 39:56.862
and he said,
"God, I miss the old days."

40:00.031 --> 40:03.101
Sarah, I am so sorry.
I should have known.

40:03.134 --> 40:05.971
- Oh, you're soft
just like your father!

40:06.004 --> 40:07.138
- Mr. Hendricks, that's enough.

40:07.172 --> 40:09.140
- I was trying to show you
how to be a man!

40:09.174 --> 40:11.443
- Sir, sit down.

40:11.477 --> 40:12.778
- That's enough.

40:12.811 --> 40:16.915
- You don't apologize.
Take what's yours.

40:16.948 --> 40:19.985
You don't have what it takes.
- Sit down.

40:27.859 --> 40:30.061
- No more questions, Your Honor.

40:30.095 --> 40:32.130
- Hey.

40:40.506 --> 40:44.042
- Lawrence Hendricks, CEO
and founder of Avalon Stores,

40:44.075 --> 40:46.244
was found guilty
of rape earlier today.

40:46.277 --> 40:47.913
Within hours of
the guilty verdict,

40:47.946 --> 40:48.914
the private equity firm--

40:48.947 --> 40:50.882
- I guess that's the end
of young Eric's career

40:50.916 --> 40:52.117
at Avalon Stores.

40:52.150 --> 40:53.118
- Cynthia's too.

40:53.151 --> 40:54.219
- SVU, Carisi.

40:54.252 --> 40:56.788
- Do you think
that Eric's generation

40:56.822 --> 40:58.957
is any better than his
grandfather's or just different?

40:58.990 --> 41:00.792
- Hey, we got another
rape in a bathroom,

41:00.826 --> 41:02.928
Murray Hill bar.

41:02.961 --> 41:04.796
- I don't think it's
any better or different.

41:04.830 --> 41:07.666
I think it's just...
younger.

41:07.699 --> 41:09.835
[phone rings]

41:09.868 --> 41:12.103
Lieutenant Benson, SVU.
