WEBVTT

00:07.882 --> 00:10.385
-Why are we waiting in line for food?
-It’s a pop-up.

00:10.468 --> 00:13.263
It’s a rare, pop-up restaurant thing
that only enters our solar system...

00:13.722 --> 00:15.473
Rick, you’re gonna spoil your appetite.

00:15.557 --> 00:18.935
That’s a weird way to say I’m gonna stop
being hungry by eating food, but whatever.

00:19.018 --> 00:21.563
-Three crispy, four wiggling.
-You’re probably not even hungry,

00:21.646 --> 00:23.815
you just don’t like lines
because they aren’t about you.

00:23.898 --> 00:27.026
Another weirdly aggressive way to
describe a friend respecting themselves.

00:28.027 --> 00:29.821
What a wonderful thing to say!

00:30.488 --> 00:33.658
I was merely inspired by
the wonderful thing you said!

00:33.742 --> 00:37.579
-Sirs? Guys? You dropped this!
-Please take it as a reward!

00:37.662 --> 00:40.248
-So courteous!
-How nice it will be for you to eat

00:40.331 --> 00:43.251
what you were willing
to stand in line for so much sooner!

00:43.334 --> 00:46.004
Oh no, that’s okay. I came to
stand in line and then eat.

00:46.087 --> 00:47.547
I wouldn’t wanna do it differently.

00:48.882 --> 00:52.093
Dear fellow, I choose this moment
to surrender my sword

00:52.177 --> 00:55.472
so that you may succeed me
as the newest Knight of the Sun.

00:55.555 --> 00:59.434
What? No. I didn’t even want
your sandwich. I don’t want your sword.

00:59.517 --> 01:01.644
Oh, believe me, son. You want it.

01:01.728 --> 01:06.858
I don’t understand. You’re knights?
With a K? Of the Sun with a U or, or an O?

01:06.941 --> 01:09.235
Your alphabet is of no concern here.

01:09.319 --> 01:13.782
We are sworn defenders of Helios,
the center of this system.

01:13.865 --> 01:15.408
Okay, so it’s Sun with a u.

01:15.492 --> 01:17.410
Oh, God. Morty, don’t take the sword.

01:17.494 --> 01:19.579
Oh, I’m shocked you’re
against something, Rick.

01:19.913 --> 01:21.748
-You know these guys?
-I know how they’re dressed

01:21.831 --> 01:24.083
and how boring this sounds.
You take that sword,

01:24.417 --> 01:27.253
you’re gonna get sucked into
a whole complicated, oh shit!

01:28.379 --> 01:29.881
Come on, take it.

01:30.590 --> 01:31.800
I mean, if that kid’s not gonna

01:31.883 --> 01:33.384
-take the sword...
-He didn’t offer it to you.

01:33.718 --> 01:36.805
Sorry, can I just ask some stuff,
what does a Knight of the Sun do?

01:36.888 --> 01:38.556
He takes the sword, for one thing.

01:38.640 --> 01:41.476
You know what, maybe you made a bad call.
He, he doesn’t want the sword.

01:41.559 --> 01:43.895
-I didn’t say that.
-Well you sure aren’t taking it!

01:43.978 --> 01:46.523
-Would you just take a random...
-Obviously I would, yes!

01:46.606 --> 01:49.943
And I did! Best decision of my life!
And you’re shitting on it!

01:50.026 --> 01:51.736
Excuse me? Is this just a free sword?

01:51.820 --> 01:53.363
-No!
-I’m taking the sword!

01:53.446 --> 01:56.574
-Thank you, Dawnling. What is your name?
-Morty.

01:56.658 --> 02:01.412
Now it is Sir Mortaniel. I made it
a little knightier. Good day.

02:02.455 --> 02:03.498
Wait, did he just...

02:03.581 --> 02:06.501
Goddammit, Morty!
You took the sword?! So boring!

02:06.584 --> 02:09.587
Oh like you’re not at this point?
You drunk cranky fuck!

02:15.343 --> 02:18.137
You guys still gonna stand in line?
Y ou’re not gonna take this food?

02:18.471 --> 02:20.557
The pop up pays us to stand here.

02:20.932 --> 02:22.517
-To drive up business.
-Knew it.

02:56.843 --> 03:01.431
Everyone! Sir Helios’ successor,
Sir Mortaniel!

03:01.514 --> 03:04.017
Sir Mortaniel, face so bright!

03:04.100 --> 03:06.686
Serves the sun with strength and might!

03:06.769 --> 03:09.272
Sir mortaniel come and see

03:09.355 --> 03:11.774
Just what the sun provides for thee!

03:11.858 --> 03:13.568
Wow, my, my own song.

03:13.651 --> 03:16.112
Now you know why Sir Helios
had to change your name

03:16.195 --> 03:20.408
to something with three syllables!
Welcome, Dawnling, to the Sun!

03:20.491 --> 03:22.952
So it is the Sun, like Earth’s sun?

03:24.120 --> 03:25.163
He’s heard of us!

03:25.246 --> 03:27.290
How come I’m not, like,
burning to a crisp?

03:27.373 --> 03:31.878
You are currently protected by our powers,
but soon they will be yours!

03:31.961 --> 03:36.215
Our flesh is indestructible!
Our lives are never-ending,

03:36.299 --> 03:39.260
but not even in the dumb vampire way
where after a while you hate it

03:39.344 --> 03:41.971
and you can’t die.
We can die whenever we want!!

03:42.055 --> 03:44.933
-We just don’t have to.
-But you’re not allowed to leave, right?

03:45.016 --> 03:47.518
Like, I’ll never see my family again?

03:47.602 --> 03:50.355
We leave constantly!
I met you on an asteroid!

03:50.438 --> 03:52.857
Oh yeah! Between us
that wasn’t a deal breaker,

03:52.941 --> 03:54.651
but it’s even better that there’s options!

03:54.734 --> 03:57.487
You’ll have more freedom
than you’ve ever known.

03:57.570 --> 03:58.821
Our king!

03:58.905 --> 04:01.324
The Sun is the center of the solar system.

04:01.407 --> 04:04.661
It is the home of the solar scepter,
around which all worlds revolve.

04:05.036 --> 04:08.581
The men who keep it safe are
admired by all and live as gods.

04:08.998 --> 04:12.418
-Any more questions?
-Yeah, where do I sign?

04:14.629 --> 04:15.630
Well that does it!

04:15.713 --> 04:19.008
-Off to the parapet to make this official.
-Yeah, let’s do this!

04:21.177 --> 04:23.513
Now just cut off your penises
and throw them into the sun.

04:25.348 --> 04:29.352
-Okey dokey.
-I see Mortaniel wants to go first.

04:29.769 --> 04:33.523
Not true. Do I just leave the sword
wherever? Is there a sword bin?

04:33.606 --> 04:34.482
What are you saying,

04:34.565 --> 04:36.734
-you don’t want to cut off...
-Listen guys, can we not...

04:36.818 --> 04:39.195
It’s a terrific and painful
sacrifice we all make

04:39.278 --> 04:42.031
for the most important and
powerful job in the universe.

04:42.115 --> 04:44.367
We’ve done it since the dawn of dawns.

04:44.450 --> 04:47.120
Yep. There it is in stained glass.
It’s official.

04:47.203 --> 04:49.831
And I’m not judging it.
And I’m not doing it.

04:50.456 --> 04:51.624
People really live here?

04:51.708 --> 04:53.167
This is nuts, I thought
it was a metaphor.

04:53.251 --> 04:54.127
We have to go!

04:55.169 --> 04:57.130
Boy. They’re not messing around?

04:57.213 --> 04:59.507
-How are you not burning?
-Oh, it’s just science,

04:59.590 --> 05:02.260
which, unless I’m misinterpreting,
is clearly not a priority here.

05:02.593 --> 05:05.346
Okay, c’mon lil Junebug,
I won’t rub your face in this one,

05:05.430 --> 05:06.973
I’m guessing you’re
feeling pretty stupid.

05:07.056 --> 05:08.641
Yes. Thank you.

05:09.017 --> 05:12.478
Sir Helios gave his life with that sword.
Mortaniel took it.

05:12.562 --> 05:15.273
He cannot leave unless
he bests me in combat.

05:16.190 --> 05:19.694
Okay, one sec. I’m guessing these guys
are like pseudo immortalish since they

05:19.777 --> 05:22.905
live on the sun, so playing by their rules
might be the fastest way out of this.

05:22.989 --> 05:24.782
-Just best him in combat.
-What?

05:24.866 --> 05:27.827
Here. This sword uses AI
to learn from an opponent’s attacks.

05:27.910 --> 05:29.662
-So I have to get attacked first?
-No, no, no,

05:29.746 --> 05:32.707
the sword has already seen Blade.
And loved it. You’ll be fine.

05:35.501 --> 05:38.588
-By golly! Oh crickey.
-Oh! Blimey. I say!

05:43.301 --> 05:47.180
-Okay, so we’re done here.
-No. We’re not done.

05:47.263 --> 05:50.224
I am done. You are now King of the Sun.

05:50.308 --> 05:53.227
-Protect the Scepter always.
-No, no, I don’t want to.

05:57.940 --> 06:01.027
Well how is that supposed to work?
He’s King, but he was never even a knight?

06:01.110 --> 06:02.904
-I mean that’s stupid.
-it’s definitely a

06:02.987 --> 06:04.906
-sun first.
-A king with a penis?

06:04.989 --> 06:06.282
Well what do you want from me?

06:06.365 --> 06:08.576
-All hail King Mortaniel!
-All hail King Mortaniel!

06:09.243 --> 06:12.371
As your King, I hereby
declare a vacation, for me,

06:12.747 --> 06:16.167
I’ll come visit you guys,
on like, Sun Days. Sundays.

06:16.501 --> 06:20.129
If I forget, just wait a week,
keep doing that, keep the crown, peace.

06:24.509 --> 06:27.178
Hell yeah! See? That’s from when
he’s fighting Deacon Frost!

06:28.429 --> 06:30.264
I don’t know. I thought it was cool.

06:30.348 --> 06:32.809
-Okay, so.
-So? Oh.

06:32.892 --> 06:34.894
So you dragged me to
a fake restaurant, yelled at me

06:34.977 --> 06:37.563
for not doing what you wanted,
then did something I told you not to

06:37.647 --> 06:39.857
and it almost cost you your
pud, but I saved your life

06:39.941 --> 06:42.235
and now you’re waiting for me
to make you feel like shit about it.

06:42.318 --> 06:43.986
That’s, yeah, you nailed it.

06:44.070 --> 06:46.781
Morty, I’m sorry I let
your opinion of me get this low.

06:46.864 --> 06:48.741
-Alright, I get it.
-There’s nothing to get,

06:48.825 --> 06:52.161
I’m for real. Look, I’m a drunk,
I’m a psychopath, I’m a murderer,

06:52.245 --> 06:53.663
but when you called me boring.

06:53.746 --> 06:55.623
-I shouldn’t have...
-I needed to hear it.

06:55.706 --> 06:58.167
And you took the stupid
sword and I was like, holy crap,

06:58.251 --> 07:01.295
this is who I am to this kid, he just
does the opposite of my advice now,

07:01.379 --> 07:04.006
I mean I, I gotta fix that,
so I’m gonna be like

07:04.090 --> 07:07.635
twenty two percent more agreeable
with you for like, maybe one episode,

07:07.718 --> 07:09.345
or one adventure.
We’ll see how it goes.

07:09.428 --> 07:11.848
-Is twenty two percent a lot?
-Well I’m not gonna tell you

07:11.931 --> 07:14.934
of our time together I’m usually mean to
you because it’ll hurt your stupid

07:15.017 --> 07:18.187
feelings but twenty two is substantial,
you’re gonna feel the difference.

07:18.271 --> 07:20.439
Okay. I mean, I appreciate it.

07:21.691 --> 07:23.734
You should, because you made
a real mess with these guys.

07:23.818 --> 07:24.652
-Oh man.
-Sire!

07:24.735 --> 07:25.695
-Sire!
-You can’t leave!

07:25.778 --> 07:26.696
Go away!

07:27.989 --> 07:32.326
My king, it is our duty to follow
you ‘til the sun sets on our watch!

07:32.410 --> 07:35.997
I mean, it set yesterday,
so you’re done. Bye.

07:36.080 --> 07:38.207
Sire, the sun never sets on the sun.

07:39.208 --> 07:41.043
-Can you get rid of them?
-You want me to...

07:41.586 --> 07:43.963
Well, you guys know he
can kill you, right?

07:44.297 --> 07:47.717
I think he’d find that quite difficult,
sire, but if it pleases you!

07:48.050 --> 07:50.845
Can’t I just tell you it
pleases me for you to go away?

07:50.928 --> 07:54.223
- No. Not really.
-So you’d rather die than leave me alone.

07:54.307 --> 07:55.349
-Yes!
-Yes!

07:55.433 --> 07:57.727
-A pheasant plucked for my good king,
-A pheasant plucked for my good king,

07:57.810 --> 08:00.021
-A merry jig, sweet songbirds sing!
-A merry jig, sweet songbirds sing!

08:01.856 --> 08:04.483
These guys live on our sun?
I’ve never heard of them.

08:04.567 --> 08:07.111
I don’t see them doing a lot
to earn interplanetary fame.

08:07.195 --> 08:11.073
I beg your pardon, wizard, the Knights
of the Sun protect the solar scepter.

08:11.157 --> 08:13.284
Around which even this world turns.

08:13.701 --> 08:16.204
You do mean that,
like symbolically, right?

08:16.287 --> 08:19.832
Oh quite literally. The Scepter is
the center of the solar system.

08:19.916 --> 08:21.250
All planets orbit it.

08:21.334 --> 08:24.879
We keep it on the sun so that Jupiter
and Saturn don’t bump into each other.

08:26.589 --> 08:28.633
-Oh my god.
-They don’t even know sixth grade science.

08:29.008 --> 08:29.926
That’s it.

08:30.635 --> 08:31.844
Yeah, so there you have it.

08:31.928 --> 08:35.389
Traditions suck ass and your most
foundational beliefs are total bullshit.

08:35.473 --> 08:37.308
We’re supposed to take your word for it?

08:37.391 --> 08:40.311
Anyone can draw circles
on a board and spout numbers.

08:40.394 --> 08:43.105
Yes, this sounds like a fun theory, sire,

08:43.189 --> 08:45.233
but it would take more than this
for us to give up...

08:45.316 --> 08:47.401
Okay so how do you guys
think it works again?

08:47.485 --> 08:49.528
-Well, the Scepter...
-Oh you mean this old thing?

08:50.780 --> 08:53.199
You want it? Here.
Take it back home. It’s a symbol.

08:53.282 --> 08:55.785
It’s your culture.
That’s not the same as reality.

08:55.868 --> 08:59.664
Does this mean we cut off our penises
for absolutely no reason?

08:59.747 --> 09:02.708
That’s the bad news.
The good news is, you’re free.

09:04.502 --> 09:06.671
-Oh that stings.
-Fuck this knights shit.

09:07.046 --> 09:10.800
A query? I just used your
computer phone to search despair.

09:11.175 --> 09:14.262
-Where can I get this heroin?
-I’m not telling you that.

09:14.345 --> 09:17.765
No matter, I’m seeing from most of your
song lyrics that I can get it anywhere.

09:20.309 --> 09:24.105
You guys, someone just used
critical thinking and basic physics

09:24.188 --> 09:26.482
to destroy their first entire religion.

09:26.565 --> 09:27.942
-Nice!
-Good job, Morty!

09:28.025 --> 09:30.152
-So no more sun-tourage?
-Yep. All done.

09:30.236 --> 09:32.738
Plus, Rick and I both learned
to support each other better.

09:32.822 --> 09:36.409
So that’s it, we’re done.
Feels early, but we’re done.

09:37.910 --> 09:41.080
What’s happening? Appliances are
breaking that I haven’t touched.

09:43.207 --> 09:44.959
Maybe the sun is celebrating?

09:47.420 --> 09:50.923
The Sons of the Moon are storming
the Walkway! Doesn’t matter.

09:51.007 --> 09:52.466
Their aggression will be kept in check

09:52.550 --> 09:55.136
by a host of interplanetary
treaties and alliances.

09:55.219 --> 09:58.222
It’s very complicated, but as long as
The Knights of the Sun stand together,

09:58.306 --> 10:01.517
the solar system will always
have complete political stability

10:01.600 --> 10:04.186
where are the Knights of the Sun,
by the way? I’m done pooping.

10:05.938 --> 10:09.608
Did the Knights of the Sun disband?

10:10.276 --> 10:13.612
While I was pooping? Sun-kward.

10:18.534 --> 10:21.120
How many planets in our
solar system have these clowns?

10:21.454 --> 10:24.040
I guess if the sun can support life,
any planet can, I mean,

10:24.123 --> 10:26.042
maybe we all descended
from a common ancestor?

10:26.125 --> 10:28.044
Haven’t you seen, like,
all of the universes?

10:28.127 --> 10:31.505
Exactly, so why would I hang out on Pluto?
That’s some Jerry-league shit.

10:32.214 --> 10:34.300
If the Sons of the Moon
can attack the sun,

10:34.383 --> 10:37.553
why should the Viscounts of Venus
continue sitting in Saturn’s shadow?

10:37.636 --> 10:41.724
How’s this for a reason:
we got all the rings and all the balls!

10:41.807 --> 10:43.184
-Oh fuck you!
-Really?

10:43.267 --> 10:46.520
If the Saturno Venusian detente
is no longer honored,

10:46.854 --> 10:49.607
I declare you all moons of Jupiter.

10:49.690 --> 10:52.526
Because that’s what you are to us!
A bunch of moons!

10:52.610 --> 10:55.946
Do the Knights of the Sun plan to
protect Mercury from this chaos?

10:56.280 --> 11:00.409
Because if we’re on our own,
there’s a new, very tiny sun in town.

11:05.081 --> 11:05.998
It’s all you, pal.

11:06.665 --> 11:10.920
Hello? Don’t I have, like, authority
over this Sons of the Moon meeting?

11:11.003 --> 11:13.172
That all depends. Who the hell are you?

11:13.255 --> 11:14.548
This guy’s the King of the Sun!

11:14.632 --> 11:16.384
-Holy shit the king of the sun.
-Wait when did this happen?

11:16.467 --> 11:18.636
Then tell your Knights to do their jobs!

11:18.719 --> 11:24.266
Yes, your majesty. We all know the sun’s
power lives and dies with your knights.

11:24.350 --> 11:26.644
-Who are you?
-Who am... Who...

11:27.853 --> 11:31.649
I am the Marquis of Mars!
And i declare war on all of you!

11:31.982 --> 11:33.776
War on all of you!

11:33.859 --> 11:36.779
Where are the Knights of the Sun
when we need them most?

11:36.862 --> 11:39.448
-Funny you should ask.
-They’re gone.

11:40.366 --> 11:42.493
They’ve abandoned their duties.

11:42.576 --> 11:45.496
-I see it in the bones.
-Damn, the bones nailed it.

11:45.579 --> 11:48.165
Okay, so you have space ships
and magic ladies?

11:48.249 --> 11:49.750
Look, I’m not gonna read all the books,

11:49.834 --> 11:52.920
what will it take to let this Sons
of the Moon fiasco resolve itself.

11:53.003 --> 11:57.633
Excuse me. How did you become King
of the Sun? You look like an Earthling.

11:57.716 --> 11:59.260
-Santa?
-Santa?

11:59.343 --> 12:02.555
What the hell is that,
I’m the Earl of Earth goddammit.

12:02.638 --> 12:04.265
I agree with Earth on one thing.

12:04.640 --> 12:07.518
Venus questions the legitimacy
of this King’s authority.

12:07.601 --> 12:10.187
-My people say I say aye! Never!
-That sun shall be ours!

12:10.271 --> 12:12.857
I’m the King!
I’ve got the scepter right here!

12:12.940 --> 12:13.816
What the fuck?

12:13.899 --> 12:17.027
Yeah yeah I know you’re freaking out
because it’s not on the sun.

12:17.111 --> 12:19.155
No, because whoever has it

12:19.238 --> 12:22.074
-rules the solar system!
-It’s up for grabs, get it!

12:22.158 --> 12:23.075
After it!

12:24.869 --> 12:26.620
Yes! Yes! I have the scepter.

12:26.704 --> 12:30.374
Soon Jupiter will be the center of
our solar system’s newest dark age...

12:30.791 --> 12:34.003
Fuck that, Mercury will now be
the shining beacon of...

12:34.920 --> 12:36.964
Time to throw it all against the wall!

12:38.090 --> 12:38.966
I think you crushed it.

12:39.049 --> 12:41.594
I mean, not just anybody
can start Solar War One.

12:41.677 --> 12:43.179
-Stop supporting me!
-Can do.

12:44.597 --> 12:48.476
Goodbye, blue sky

12:49.351 --> 12:53.814
Goodbye, blue sky
Goodbye

12:57.276 --> 12:58.777
Goodbye

13:02.573 --> 13:05.493
Did you see the frightened ones?

13:06.952 --> 13:10.080
Did you hear the falling bombs?

13:11.373 --> 13:16.337
Did you ever wonder why we
had to run for shelter when the

13:16.420 --> 13:21.342
Promise of a brave new world
unfurled beneath a clear blue Sky?

13:42.238 --> 13:45.157
Did you see the frightened ones?

13:46.617 --> 13:49.537
Did you hear the falling bombs?

13:50.955 --> 13:55.501
The flames are all long gone,
but the pain lingers on

13:59.463 --> 14:03.092
Goodbye, blue sky

14:04.218 --> 14:08.556
Goodbye, blue sky
Goodbye

14:12.184 --> 14:13.102
Goodbye

14:17.314 --> 14:19.024
Damn, who would have thought
giving the Amish nukes

14:19.108 --> 14:22.319
-would threaten the solar system?
-Maybe we should just jump universes.

14:22.403 --> 14:25.447
I don’t know buddy, feels like we’re kind
of more about trying out commitment now,

14:25.531 --> 14:27.950
ya know? Let’s put our heads together,
maybe there’s something

14:28.033 --> 14:30.452
-we haven’t tried yet.
-Oh, here’s an idea. Fuck you!

14:30.536 --> 14:31.870
-Hey!
-Rick, I can’t take it,

14:31.954 --> 14:33.497
I admit I’m wrong, I screwed up,

14:33.581 --> 14:37.585
you’re killing me here yes-anding me
to death, what is this, Vat of Acid again?

14:37.668 --> 14:39.712
Look man, I’m sorry I’ve been
such a dick in the past

14:39.795 --> 14:41.338
that you think I’m doing a thing here.

14:41.422 --> 14:43.465
I’m honestly just trying
to do better by you.

14:44.091 --> 14:45.759
-Are you a robot?
-Morty!

14:45.843 --> 14:46.594
-A clone?
-Morty!

14:46.677 --> 14:48.721
This family’s got enough
clones and robots in it.

14:48.804 --> 14:50.556
Come on, Morty, stop asking
what you’re asking

14:50.639 --> 14:52.266
and let’s just get back to our crisis.

14:52.349 --> 14:55.144
I’m sorry, it’s just been
a hard road with you, Rick.

14:55.227 --> 14:57.229
Morty, I get that but you
can trust me when I say

14:57.313 --> 14:58.772
I’m just trying to do right by you.

14:59.106 --> 15:03.902
Okay, Rick. You’re right, maybe I just
need to round up some Knights?

15:03.986 --> 15:07.531
If I disillusioned the old ones,
I’ll just have to reillusion them.

15:07.615 --> 15:08.949
It shouldn’t be that hard, right?

15:16.123 --> 15:18.792
Cousins, we need to return
to the walkway at once!

15:21.170 --> 15:22.296
Why are you laughing,

15:22.379 --> 15:24.882
- did I say something funny?
-Oh, Mortaniel!

15:24.965 --> 15:28.677
The only person we bend the knee to
these days is that sweet Black Betty.

15:28.761 --> 15:34.141
-Yeah man, all hail Mr. Brownstone!
-And his doctor. Feelgood that is!

15:34.224 --> 15:36.185
They’re talking about heroin, Morty,
they like it.

15:36.268 --> 15:38.020
-Obviously.
-Obviously?

15:38.103 --> 15:41.732
Apparently living on the sun has turned
our veins into triple-bonded carbon,

15:42.066 --> 15:44.109
so try this tale on for size, Mortaniel.

15:44.443 --> 15:47.446
-We can’t OD!
-C’mon, you guys are a mess.

15:47.529 --> 15:49.323
Well, they actually seem
kinda awesome, Morty.

15:49.406 --> 15:52.493
Lemme be your king. I admit
I wanted what you once had.

15:52.576 --> 15:54.995
Brotherhood, tradition,
stability, purpose.

15:55.079 --> 15:57.498
I just didn’t want to
cut my dick off for it.

15:57.581 --> 16:00.834
Yeah that’s the point. We were
quick to follow this boy before,

16:00.918 --> 16:03.504
without even forcing him to
commit to our traditions.

16:03.587 --> 16:07.508
And all he did was break our faith
and our walkway. And now,

16:07.591 --> 16:12.930
this random fucking guy is here again
to tell us what to do? No fucking way.

16:14.139 --> 16:15.432
What if I cut off my dick?

16:16.850 --> 16:19.144
But you’d be cutting it off for no reason.

16:19.228 --> 16:22.189
Yeah that’s the point of tradition,
doing things for no reason,

16:22.606 --> 16:25.275
but it’d be reason enough
doing it for you guys.

16:25.901 --> 16:29.321
Well you do that,
that would compete with heroin.

16:29.405 --> 16:31.490
Cool, cool can I maybe get maybe a minute?

16:33.117 --> 16:36.954
Buddy, what’s up? Reaching some
sad conclusions about your situation?

16:37.037 --> 16:38.956
Yes, but that walkway needs those knights,

16:39.039 --> 16:41.750
those knights need a king
and that king needs no dick!

16:41.834 --> 16:43.752
Damn, Morty, you really are stepping up.

16:44.253 --> 16:46.338
Now do you want me to help you not have to

16:46.422 --> 16:48.048
-cut your dick off though?
-Yes please!

16:48.132 --> 16:50.426
-Then I got you.
-You really mean it, Rick?

16:50.509 --> 16:52.553
Of course, buddy.
I’ll give you a fake dick.

16:52.636 --> 16:55.514
With three layers of failsafes,
they’ll never know the difference.

16:56.724 --> 16:59.101
Morty. We’re gonna make
your dick so fake, buddy.

17:06.692 --> 17:07.651
The signal!

17:07.735 --> 17:10.362
-Sir the Knights of the Sun are once more!
-Hold fire!

17:10.821 --> 17:13.073
If this return to the Old Ways is true,

17:13.157 --> 17:16.201
I’d be willing to return home
and put an end to the bloodshed.

17:30.007 --> 17:33.010
Sir, Shall we hold off on the
anti matter hydrogen bombing?

17:33.802 --> 17:36.680
Those crusty knights won’t do
the sun much good without their...

17:38.390 --> 17:39.433
Let’s hear them out.

17:42.102 --> 17:46.940
I, Lithdor, son of Thrifdor personally
oversee the stumping of thy King’s stem.

17:47.483 --> 17:51.862
If his stem burns true, peace will
be restored between the spheres!

17:56.200 --> 17:58.494
Present the shears of stumping!

17:58.952 --> 18:01.455
-Morty the brave! You got this, my king!
-Yes! Good for you!

18:05.042 --> 18:06.043
First thing’s first,

18:06.126 --> 18:09.963
step through this machine which checks
for nano technological hologram dicks.

18:10.047 --> 18:11.590
-What?
-War opened our eyes

18:11.673 --> 18:15.761
to the wonders of new technologies!
Please, step through my liege.

18:23.852 --> 18:27.189
Sorry, my lord, but we’re gonna need
you to step through this second machine

18:27.272 --> 18:30.192
-which checks for emergency clone dicks.
-Oh wow,

18:30.275 --> 18:32.986
you guys really embraced
a lot of specific new tech.

18:33.821 --> 18:35.531
-A sunspot!
-What? Where?

18:38.283 --> 18:41.578
Boy, is that a third detector
I see as well?

18:41.912 --> 18:44.665
You’ll find out after the second one,
we don’t like to reveal them

18:44.748 --> 18:46.333
until the previous detecting threshold

18:46.416 --> 18:47.751
-has been crossed.
-Right.

18:50.420 --> 18:53.632
The third detector is going
to scan for a prosthetic dick.

18:53.715 --> 18:56.260
-Oh good.
-Okay well go on through,

18:56.343 --> 18:59.471
and of course, by prosthetic
we mean witchcraft dick.

19:00.055 --> 19:00.848
-Shit.
-Fuck!

19:00.931 --> 19:04.476
I sense one!
The bones say he’s still packin’!

19:07.229 --> 19:10.399
Can’t get nothin’ past the
chicken bone lady. Just testing her.

19:11.316 --> 19:14.319
Stump. Thy. Stem.

19:15.487 --> 19:18.824
Morty? Morty, don’t answer out loud,
can you hear me? It’s Rick,

19:18.907 --> 19:21.243
-I’m talking to you with my mind.
-Yeah I can hear you.

19:21.326 --> 19:23.912
-You said that out loud, don’t speak.
-Sorry. Sorry.

19:23.996 --> 19:27.207
I uplinked a telepathic nano satellite
so we could hear each other’s thoughts,

19:27.291 --> 19:31.169
carefully do everything I tell you
in the exact order I tell you to do it.

19:31.253 --> 19:33.005
-Okay.
-Grab the scissors.

19:33.088 --> 19:34.339
Okay. Got the scissors.

19:35.424 --> 19:37.426
-Now run.
-Oh shit, shit!

19:37.509 --> 19:38.760
Guards, seize them!

19:39.303 --> 19:40.846
Run? You couldn’t have just said that?!

19:40.929 --> 19:42.472
You don’t have to use telepathy anymore,

19:42.556 --> 19:44.600
you can just ask your
rhetorical questions out loud!

19:44.683 --> 19:45.976
I don’t understand, Rick.

19:46.059 --> 19:47.936
Here’s something that’s
easy to understand buddy,

19:48.020 --> 19:50.230
I’m proud of you for trying
to solve your own shit.

19:50.898 --> 19:53.400
-I didn’t want to have to do this.
-It’s okay this time,

19:53.483 --> 19:54.610
we don’t
have any choice.

19:55.402 --> 19:57.404
-I love you, Rick.
-Love you too, buddy.

20:03.243 --> 20:06.330
And that’s when King Morty
and Rick were left with no choice

20:06.413 --> 20:07.956
but to leap into the sun.

20:08.040 --> 20:12.085
Such shame he felt for what he’d done
to our society, sacrificing his dick

20:12.169 --> 20:16.673
wasn’t enough, he gave his entire
body and wizard servant as well.

20:16.757 --> 20:20.135
And after a while, their sun-proof
bones floated up to the top.

20:20.552 --> 20:23.680
We even checked with a royal ladle
to ensure it was real sun,

20:23.764 --> 20:26.558
not just them hiding beneath
in a vat of fake sun.

20:26.642 --> 20:31.063
Such a violent death. And finally
when our grief could bear no more,

20:31.146 --> 20:34.775
we decided to abolish our
medieval act of stem stumping.

20:34.858 --> 20:38.153
And we have King Morty
the Molten to thank for that!

20:38.236 --> 20:41.281
-Morty the Molten! King Morty the Molten!
-Morty the Molten! King Morty the Molten!

20:41.615 --> 20:42.950
See, Morty? Worked like a charm!

20:43.283 --> 20:45.369
Aren’t we risking it all coming back here?

20:45.452 --> 20:48.246
Morty, we had to know, plus the
heat, it’s good for my joints.

20:48.330 --> 20:50.582
King Mortaniel? You’re alive?

20:50.958 --> 20:53.835
Yeah, go tell everybody. Your reward’s
gonna be cutting off your own dick.

20:54.711 --> 20:58.548
Right. Point taken. RIP and cheerio.

21:34.042 --> 21:36.378
-One crispy, one wriggling.
-Coming right up.

21:36.712 --> 21:40.173
-Three loozums.
-How ‘bout ten years? In jail.

21:40.674 --> 21:44.970
Special Agent Mongo Bongo, you’re under
arrest for illegal hot dog trafficking.

21:59.693 --> 22:01.862
Be free, my little babies.

22:04.990 --> 22:06.408
Surprised they actually made it.

22:06.867 --> 22:09.202
Kinda thought maybe some birds
would swoop down or...

22:10.787 --> 22:12.122
I jinxed it!
