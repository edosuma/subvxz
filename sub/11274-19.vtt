00:02.085 --> 00:05.088
Cheers is filmed before
a live studio audience.

00:09.092 --> 00:11.394
Don't work too hard there, Diane.

00:11.394 --> 00:12.896
I don't mind.

00:14.147 --> 00:15.982
Our wedding day draws ever nearer,

00:16.483 --> 00:18.985
and all this conditioning
is simply preparation

00:18.985 --> 00:21.488
for that special moment.

00:21.488 --> 00:23.356
When you and I exchange rings,

00:23.356 --> 00:26.276
my hands must be pristine,

00:26.276 --> 00:29.162
because everyone's eyes
will be on my fingers.

00:29.162 --> 00:32.582
And everyone's fingers'll
be down their throats.

00:34.084 --> 00:35.952
Oh, Carla.

00:35.952 --> 00:38.288
Sweet, pathetic Carla.

00:38.288 --> 00:41.791
Can't you see that I am
in far too good a mood

00:41.791 --> 00:45.045
to let your petty asides bother me?

00:45.045 --> 00:46.880
I'm afraid you'll just have to find

00:46.880 --> 00:49.766
some other way of... bugging me.

00:49.766 --> 00:51.885
If you insist.

00:51.885 --> 00:54.687
(screaming)

00:58.691 --> 01:03.063
(piano plays)

01:03.063 --> 01:05.364
? Making your way in the world today ?

01:05.364 --> 01:08.368
? Takes everything you've got ?

01:08.368 --> 01:11.371
? Taking a break from all your worries ?

01:11.371 --> 01:14.374
? Sure would help a lot ?

01:14.374 --> 01:20.413
? Wouldn't you like to get away? ?

01:20.413 --> 01:22.415
? Sometimes you want to go ?

01:22.415 --> 01:27.921
? Where everybody knows your name ?

01:27.921 --> 01:32.425
? And they're always glad you came ?

01:32.425 --> 01:34.928
? You want to be where you can see ?

01:34.928 --> 01:37.430
? Our troubles are all the same ?

01:37.430 --> 01:42.936
? You want to be where
everybody knows your name ?

01:42.936 --> 01:45.438
? You want to go where people know ?

01:45.438 --> 01:47.941
? People are all the same ?

01:47.941 --> 01:52.946
? You want to go where
everybody knows your name. ?

02:09.795 --> 02:12.132
Yes! Thank you for telling me.

02:12.132 --> 02:14.634
If you don't hear from me
in an hour, I'll be there.

02:14.634 --> 02:16.636
Okay, thank you.

02:16.636 --> 02:20.140
Oh, Sam, uh, may I speak
to you for a minute?

02:20.140 --> 02:22.642
Oh, it'd be a new record if you do.

02:23.643 --> 02:28.148
Um, that was a Buddhist
monastery called The Glade.

02:28.648 --> 02:31.151
I've been hoping to go on retreat there,

02:31.151 --> 02:32.152
and guess what?

02:32.152 --> 02:33.153
They have a vacancy.

02:33.153 --> 02:34.154
Oh, great!

02:34.154 --> 02:35.655
Yeah, I heard all the monks went

02:35.655 --> 02:38.158
to Fort Lauderdale this year.

02:38.158 --> 02:41.161
No, Sam, it's not a resort.

02:41.161 --> 02:43.663
It's a contemplative retreat

02:43.663 --> 02:46.666
where people go as a means
of purifying their souls.

02:46.666 --> 02:48.668
For two weeks, you're
isolated from others

02:49.169 --> 02:51.171
to commune with yourself.

02:51.171 --> 02:53.673
You are provided with a small room.

02:53.673 --> 02:57.427
You're fed pure, toxin-free foods.

02:57.427 --> 02:58.761
Oh, oh, wait, wait.

02:58.761 --> 03:01.147
And...

03:01.147 --> 03:02.899
they have the biggest Buddha
east of the Mississippi.

03:02.899 --> 03:03.900
Ooh!

03:03.900 --> 03:05.401
Man!

03:05.401 --> 03:06.853
Boy, he is a bruiser, isn't he?

03:06.853 --> 03:08.354
Uh-huh.

03:08.354 --> 03:10.857
Well, it's not exactly Vegas,

03:10.857 --> 03:12.859
but, uh, all right, I'll give it a try.

03:12.859 --> 03:14.360
Wh-Wh-What
should I bring?

03:14.360 --> 03:15.862
Oh...

03:15.862 --> 03:18.364
No, Sam...

03:18.364 --> 03:19.866
I'm going alone.

03:19.866 --> 03:22.368
Only in my solitude

03:22.368 --> 03:24.871
can I discover who we are.

03:24.871 --> 03:26.873
SAM: Oh, wait-wait a minute here.

03:26.873 --> 03:28.374
This isn't one of those weird cults

03:28.374 --> 03:29.876
where they-they mess with your head

03:29.876 --> 03:32.378
and you end up handing
out flowers at the airport.

03:33.379 --> 03:35.381
You will be coming back, won't you?

03:35.381 --> 03:39.385
No, I won't be coming back, but I will.

03:39.886 --> 03:40.887
(laughs)

03:42.388 --> 03:45.892
I guess I just made up a
little Zen koan, didn't I?

03:48.895 --> 03:50.396
Let me explain.

03:50.396 --> 03:53.900
A koan is a... a paradox

03:53.900 --> 03:54.901
upon which one meditates

03:54.901 --> 03:56.903
in order to become more enlightened.

03:56.903 --> 03:58.404
Uh, well, for example,

03:58.404 --> 04:01.908
what was your face before
your parents were born?

04:01.908 --> 04:03.793
Easy. A ten.

04:04.961 --> 04:06.879
This is kind of fun. You got any more?

04:06.879 --> 04:09.382
DIANE: Well, I'm off to The Glade.

04:09.382 --> 04:11.384
It is all right, isn't it?

04:11.384 --> 04:12.385
Yeah, yeah, what the heck?

04:12.385 --> 04:14.887
Why not? Sure, go ahead.

04:14.887 --> 04:17.390
Good-bye, my love.

04:17.390 --> 04:18.891
SAM: Bye-bye.

04:18.891 --> 04:20.260
Steal me an ashtray.

04:23.179 --> 04:24.681
Hey, hey, hey, is Diane taking

04:24.681 --> 04:26.182
the day off again?

04:26.182 --> 04:28.184
No.

04:28.184 --> 04:29.102
Good.

04:29.102 --> 04:30.603
She's taking two weeks off.

04:30.603 --> 04:32.605
(gasps) No, Sammy, that's not fair!

04:32.605 --> 04:34.107
Come on, she's always takin' off

04:34.107 --> 04:36.109
for one stupid reason or another.

04:36.109 --> 04:37.860
Can't we just kill her?

04:38.745 --> 04:40.613
Sh-She's my fiancÃ©e, Carla.

04:40.613 --> 04:41.781
Is that a yes?

04:41.781 --> 04:42.999
No, it's not.

04:44.250 --> 04:46.252
Hey, hey, everybody.

04:46.252 --> 04:48.254
SAM: Hey, Cliffie.

04:48.254 --> 04:49.756
What's with your leg?

04:49.756 --> 04:51.758
Eh, I'd rather not talk about it.

04:54.627 --> 04:56.129
Got bitten by a dog.

04:56.129 --> 04:57.630
Ten stitches to close the wound.

04:59.515 --> 05:00.933
I tell you, these unleashed animals

05:00.933 --> 05:02.935
are a menace to postal workers.

05:02.935 --> 05:04.304
Well, you're going to sue, aren't you?

05:04.304 --> 05:05.305
Well...

05:05.305 --> 05:06.306
Now, I may be wrong, Carla,

05:06.306 --> 05:07.307
but I don't think you can sue

05:07.807 --> 05:09.809
members of the animal kingdom.

05:12.312 --> 05:15.315
I'm talking about the
owners, Nellie Belle.

05:15.315 --> 05:17.200
CLIFF: No, there-there's
no need to sue.

05:17.200 --> 05:21.037
I left a, uh, strongly
worded note in their mailbox.

05:21.037 --> 05:22.038
Well, that's too bad, Cliff.

05:22.038 --> 05:24.040
I know a lawyer who would
take it on a contingency basis.

05:24.040 --> 05:25.041
It wouldn't cost you a dime,

05:25.041 --> 05:26.909
and you might end up
with a sizable settlement.

05:26.909 --> 05:28.795
All right, if it'll get
you off my back. All right.

05:29.796 --> 05:31.664
(phone rings)

05:31.664 --> 05:33.499
(phone drops in the water)

05:35.501 --> 05:37.503
Cheers.

05:37.503 --> 05:40.506
Yeah, oh, just a minute, please.

05:40.506 --> 05:42.508
Mr. Clavin, for you.

05:42.508 --> 05:43.509
Uh, take a message.

05:43.509 --> 05:45.011
I'll call 'em back, Wood.

05:45.011 --> 05:47.013
Yeah, can he get back to you?

05:47.013 --> 05:48.398
Oh, yes, ma'am.

05:48.398 --> 05:50.233
She wants to know how your leg is.

05:50.233 --> 05:54.153
Eh? Eh? See? The mutt's
owner tracked me down.

05:54.153 --> 05:56.155
Well, tell her that she can deep-six

05:56.155 --> 05:57.657
that phony concern of hers.

05:57.657 --> 05:59.659
It doesn't cut it with me.

05:59.659 --> 06:02.161
You can deep-six your phony concern.

06:02.161 --> 06:03.529
It doesn't cut it with him.

06:04.781 --> 06:07.784
Tell her my leg and I
will see her in court.

06:07.784 --> 06:10.286
His leg and him will see you in court.

06:10.286 --> 06:13.790
Oh, okay, I'll tell him.

06:13.790 --> 06:16.292
Uh, your mom wants you to
be home by 6:00 for dinner.

06:18.294 --> 06:21.297
Woody, Woody, why didn't
you tell me it was my mother?

06:21.297 --> 06:22.799
I just did.

06:22.799 --> 06:24.300
No, I mean before.

06:24.300 --> 06:26.803
Well, I didn't know it was
her till I picked up the phone.

06:26.803 --> 06:28.805
No, Woody...

06:30.189 --> 06:32.058
When you were talkin' to her,

06:32.058 --> 06:34.060
why didn't you say it was her?

06:34.060 --> 06:35.445
She already knew that.

06:37.647 --> 06:38.981
Uh, I'd leave it alone, Cliff.

06:38.981 --> 06:40.983
I think it's one of
those Zen koan things.

06:48.991 --> 06:51.377
Eh, buono sera, mi amigos.

06:51.377 --> 06:53.246
Hey, Cliffie, how's your leg?

06:53.246 --> 06:55.248
Oh, stiffening up there, Sammy.

06:55.248 --> 06:56.249
Uh, the muscle's all cramped,

06:56.249 --> 06:58.751
and I think the, uh, wound's
getting a little infected.

06:58.751 --> 07:00.753
And the mental anguish
that goes along with this...

07:00.753 --> 07:03.256
You know, you just... you
just can't put a price on this.

07:03.256 --> 07:04.257
Well, let me guess here.

07:04.757 --> 07:06.259
You've seen an attorney.

07:06.259 --> 07:08.261
Yep. Yeah, yeah, the guy
said that, uh, you know,

07:08.761 --> 07:11.180
97% of all these canine attack cases...

07:11.180 --> 07:13.266
decided in favor of the postman.

07:13.766 --> 07:14.767
Well, good for you, Cliff.

07:15.268 --> 07:17.770
You deserve to get a little
satisfaction out of this.

07:17.770 --> 07:19.772
Yeah, yeah, about, uh,
200,000 clams worth.

07:19.772 --> 07:20.773
Two hundred thousand?!

07:20.773 --> 07:23.276
Dinner is on Cliff, all right?

07:23.776 --> 07:25.278
Huh, what do you say, buddy?

07:25.278 --> 07:27.029
I'll go upstairs, snag us a table,

07:27.029 --> 07:27.947
check out the specials.

07:27.947 --> 07:29.449
I'll be right back.

07:29.949 --> 07:30.950
Eh, eh?

07:30.950 --> 07:33.453
Hey, maybe I could sue
somebody about my broken thumb.

07:33.453 --> 07:35.455
I mean, after all, I
did slip on the ice.

07:35.455 --> 07:36.956
Well, maybe so. Where'd it happen?

07:36.956 --> 07:38.458
Right outside the bar here.

07:38.458 --> 07:39.842
No, you don't have a case.

07:40.760 --> 07:42.261
Hey, Cliff? Huh?

07:42.261 --> 07:44.263
Have you ever thought
that you might be suing

07:44.263 --> 07:46.766
some poor, sweet, little old lady?

07:46.766 --> 07:49.268
Hey, listen, uh, sharpie,
who she is is irrelevant.

07:49.268 --> 07:51.771
It's the letter of the law
that's been violated here,

07:51.771 --> 07:53.773
and I just can't wait
to get her into court

07:53.773 --> 07:56.776
and tear her to pieces
with my verbal gymnastics.

07:56.776 --> 07:57.777
(chuckles)

08:02.782 --> 08:03.783
Um...

08:03.783 --> 08:05.785
I'm looking

08:05.785 --> 08:07.787
for a Mr. Cliff Clavin.

08:07.787 --> 08:08.788
Yep.

08:10.790 --> 08:13.292
You left this note in my mailbox.

08:13.292 --> 08:16.295
I'm afraid it was my dog that bit you.

08:17.296 --> 08:18.798
Uh...

08:20.299 --> 08:22.301
Uh...

08:22.301 --> 08:24.303
Excuse me.

08:24.303 --> 08:26.305
Cliffie, wh-what are you trying to say?

08:26.305 --> 08:29.809
(speaking gibberish)

08:29.809 --> 08:33.813
Yes, sh-she is very attractive.

08:33.813 --> 08:37.817
Mr. Clavin, I'm terribly
sorry about what happened.

08:37.817 --> 08:40.318
Uh, how is your leg?

08:40.318 --> 08:42.321
(speaking gibberish)

08:42.321 --> 08:44.323
Cliffie, we're in luck.

08:44.323 --> 08:48.828
The special is filet of...
filet... filet... filet...

08:48.828 --> 08:52.832
Great. Stereo.

08:52.832 --> 08:54.333
SAM: Hey, guys, guys, guys, guys,

08:54.333 --> 08:55.835
hey, hey, hey, hey, whoa, whoa!

08:55.835 --> 08:57.336
Sit down, sit down.

08:57.336 --> 08:58.838
Come on, come on, come on.

08:58.838 --> 09:00.840
Can I, uh... can I...

09:00.840 --> 09:02.842
can I offer you a-a drink, Miss...?

09:02.842 --> 09:04.844
Keith. Madeline Keith.

09:04.844 --> 09:06.846
A white wine would be lovely, thank you.

09:06.846 --> 09:09.348
Coming right up.

09:09.348 --> 09:12.852
Look, um... I don't
have very much money,

09:12.852 --> 09:16.355
but I'd like to help
with the doctor bills.

09:17.356 --> 09:18.357
That's good.

09:18.357 --> 09:20.359
That's good.

09:20.359 --> 09:24.363
Anything to ease the burden
on you and your family.

09:26.365 --> 09:27.366
You're not married.

09:27.366 --> 09:29.368
You're not married.

09:30.369 --> 09:32.872
Oh, oh, I mean, I'm not married.

09:32.872 --> 09:34.874
But I could be if I
wanted to, right, Sam?

09:34.874 --> 09:35.875
Sure, Cliff.

09:35.875 --> 09:37.877
Well...

09:37.877 --> 09:40.880
I can't imagine a man
like you living alone.

09:40.880 --> 09:42.882
Uh, uh, I don't live alone.

09:42.882 --> 09:44.884
I live with my... mother.

09:44.884 --> 09:46.385
Oh?

09:46.385 --> 09:48.888
Yeah, well, it's, you
know, not that I have to.

09:48.888 --> 09:50.890
It's we're related.

09:50.890 --> 09:53.392
Uh, well, you know, don't get me wrong.

09:53.392 --> 09:54.393
I mean, I like her. Uh...

09:54.393 --> 09:56.395
No, I think it's wonderful

09:56.395 --> 09:59.899
that you're taking care of
your mother in her old age.

10:01.901 --> 10:04.904
Oh, uh... couldn't throw her
out in the street, I guess, huh?

10:04.904 --> 10:07.406
Hey, I mean, who-who'd make my lunch?

10:07.406 --> 10:09.408
(laughs)

10:12.411 --> 10:15.414
Oh, Mr. Clavin...

10:15.414 --> 10:18.417
You know... it's too bad

10:18.417 --> 10:20.920
we didn't meet under
different circumstances.

10:20.920 --> 10:22.922
We could've been friends.

10:22.922 --> 10:27.426
Yeah... I guess that is too bad, huh?

10:27.927 --> 10:32.431
Look... here is my number.

10:32.431 --> 10:35.434
If you need anything...

10:35.434 --> 10:37.937
call me.

10:41.941 --> 10:43.943
WOODY: Maybe it's just me,

10:43.943 --> 10:46.445
but I think that woman's kind of pretty.

10:48.447 --> 10:51.951
Really? I, uh... hadn't noticed.

10:51.951 --> 10:54.320
Too busy thinking
about the lawsuit, huh?

10:54.320 --> 10:55.705
Lawsuit?

11:03.596 --> 11:05.898
TV ANNOUNCER: Jake the Snake
is body-slammed to the mat.

11:05.898 --> 11:07.900
He's pinned by Hulk Hogan.

11:07.900 --> 11:09.402
One, two, three!

11:09.402 --> 11:10.903
The Hulk wins it!

11:10.903 --> 11:13.906
Oh, man, that Hulk Hogan
is amazing, isn't he?

11:13.906 --> 11:15.908
Woody, the thing is fixed.

11:15.908 --> 11:17.777
Oh, that's too bad.

11:17.777 --> 11:19.662
Hulk Hogan can't have children.

11:23.582 --> 11:25.668
It's evolution's loss.

11:30.873 --> 11:31.757
Hey, everybody.

11:31.757 --> 11:34.710
Cliffie, who died?

11:35.211 --> 11:37.713
The old Cliff Clavin,
that's who, Normie.

11:37.713 --> 11:38.714
Nice threads.

11:38.714 --> 11:40.132
CLIFF: Ah, thank you, Sammy.

11:40.132 --> 11:41.016
Can I have a little drink there,

11:41.016 --> 11:42.468
uh, Woody?

11:42.968 --> 11:43.969
We have, uh, enough time

11:43.969 --> 11:45.855
before Madeline and I go
out to dinner this evening.

11:45.855 --> 11:47.690
Wait a minute, are you
still seeing each other?

11:47.690 --> 11:49.442
Every day this week, buddy.

11:49.442 --> 11:51.277
Oh, things are getting pretty hot, huh?

11:51.277 --> 11:52.778
Sammy, our relationship is not

11:52.778 --> 11:54.647
based merely on the physical, huh?

11:54.647 --> 11:58.401
He isn't getting any.

11:58.401 --> 12:01.904
Well, I, uh, better go
check up on our reservations.

12:01.904 --> 12:04.290
Uh, Cliff, I hate to bring
up an ugly subject, but, uh...

12:04.790 --> 12:05.591
Oh, that's okay, Sam.

12:05.791 --> 12:07.793
We're already in the area.

12:07.793 --> 12:10.663
Are-Are you still planning to
go through with the lawsuit?

12:10.663 --> 12:13.082
Well, you, uh, you know how slowly

12:13.082 --> 12:16.085
the wheels of justice
grind there, Samuel.

12:16.085 --> 12:17.970
Uh-oh. (whistles)

12:17.970 --> 12:19.472
Guess what sap is being suckered

12:19.972 --> 12:21.724
into dropping a lawsuit?

12:21.724 --> 12:24.009
Well, now, not
necessarily now, all right?

12:24.009 --> 12:26.011
Let's just take a look
at all these facts,

12:26.011 --> 12:27.430
as complicated as they may be,

12:27.430 --> 12:29.315
and see if we can come to
a conclusion about this.

12:29.315 --> 12:31.267
Okay, let's start where
this gorgeous woman

12:31.267 --> 12:33.769
is interested in Cliff, all right?

12:33.769 --> 12:35.771
Now, I don't think we have
to go any further than that.

12:37.239 --> 12:38.157
No, now, just a second.

12:38.157 --> 12:39.909
I mean, I don't think
we're really being fair.

12:39.909 --> 12:40.993
Now, let's say

12:40.993 --> 12:42.778
if an ugly woman were
interested in Cliff,

12:42.778 --> 12:43.779
would any of us be suspicious?

12:43.779 --> 12:46.165
If a living woman were
interested in Cliff,

12:46.165 --> 12:47.166
I'd be suspicious.

12:48.417 --> 12:50.753
You know, I got to go along
with Dr. Crane on this one.

12:50.753 --> 12:52.755
I can't believe that
someone would actually lie

12:52.755 --> 12:55.007
just to save a lot of money.

12:56.792 --> 12:59.178
Woody, don't help me, okay?

13:00.095 --> 13:03.599
Listen, somebody's got
to tell Cliff the truth.

13:03.599 --> 13:06.969
I guarantee that he'll never
talk to the person who does.

13:06.969 --> 13:09.972
Okay, you talked me into it.

13:09.972 --> 13:12.475
Hey, Hopalong!

13:12.475 --> 13:13.976
Come here. I want to talk to you.

13:13.976 --> 13:15.978
CLIFF: Huh?

13:16.979 --> 13:18.481
(clears throat)

13:18.481 --> 13:20.983
I don't know how to tell you this.

13:21.484 --> 13:22.485
Wait a minute. Yes, I do.

13:22.985 --> 13:24.487
You're an idiot!

13:24.487 --> 13:26.489
Everybody in the bar thinks

13:26.489 --> 13:27.990
that babe is playing you for a fool

13:28.491 --> 13:30.993
and the second you drop
your lawsuit, you're history.

13:30.993 --> 13:32.995
You are a sap.

13:32.995 --> 13:36.999
I know... but I'm having
the time of my life.

13:36.999 --> 13:39.502
You know, uh, how often am I a sap

13:39.502 --> 13:40.503
with a beautiful woman?

13:40.503 --> 13:43.005
I mean, I usually am
a sap with the bowsers,

13:43.005 --> 13:45.007
but, uh...

13:45.007 --> 13:46.509
when Madeline and I
walk into a restaurant,

13:47.009 --> 13:48.511
all the guys' heads, they turn.

13:49.011 --> 13:50.012
And they're not saying, "Hey...

13:50.012 --> 13:52.515
there's a beautiful woman
over there with a sap."

13:52.515 --> 13:56.018
Yes, they are.

13:56.018 --> 13:58.521
Look, all I know is that
as long as we're together,

13:58.521 --> 14:03.526
there's a good chance she may
grant me the, uh, ultimate favor.

14:03.526 --> 14:05.027
Yeah, right, Clavin.

14:05.027 --> 14:07.530
You're threatening to
sue her, not kill her.

14:12.918 --> 14:15.871
Oh, uh, Madeline.

14:17.256 --> 14:19.592
You... You look ravishing as ever.

14:19.592 --> 14:23.095
Thank you, Cliff. I
thought you would like it.

14:23.095 --> 14:24.096
(laughs) Like it?!

14:24.096 --> 14:26.599
If I had better legs,
I'd get one for myself.

14:26.599 --> 14:27.466
(giggles)

14:27.466 --> 14:30.269
Oh, Cliff, you're adorable.

14:30.269 --> 14:31.520
(chuckling)

14:32.771 --> 14:34.273
Uh, we better get going.

14:34.273 --> 14:36.275
Uh, late for the reservations, huh?

14:36.275 --> 14:38.277
Um, before we go,

14:38.277 --> 14:41.780
I think we need to sit
down and have a talk.

14:43.782 --> 14:46.285
Is, there, uh, something wrong?

14:46.285 --> 14:49.288
Actually, yes.

14:50.289 --> 14:53.158
What, uh... what is it, Madeline?

14:53.158 --> 14:55.377
MADELINE: Well...

14:55.377 --> 14:58.297
this lawsuit has been
preying on my mind,

14:58.297 --> 15:02.801
and... well, my attorney gave me this.

15:02.801 --> 15:06.305
It's a waiver form.

15:06.305 --> 15:11.310
It releases me from all
liability for the dog bite.

15:12.311 --> 15:16.181
And, uh, I guess you
want me to sign it, huh?

15:16.181 --> 15:18.851
I want you to tear it up.

15:18.851 --> 15:19.685
Well, I don't understand...

15:19.685 --> 15:22.187
Please, just tear it up.

15:30.362 --> 15:33.365
When this first began,

15:33.365 --> 15:36.368
I thought I could get
you to drop the lawsuit,

15:36.368 --> 15:38.370
if I was nice to you.

15:38.370 --> 15:42.758
But then, the funniest thing happened.

15:43.542 --> 15:46.929
I grew to like you... a lot.

15:47.680 --> 15:50.683
But I'll understand if you hate me

15:50.683 --> 15:52.685
for what I was going to do.

15:52.685 --> 15:55.054
I was playing with your emotions

15:55.054 --> 15:57.940
when you've been so honest with me.

15:57.940 --> 16:00.859
Uh, well, I-I forgive
you, Madeline, uh...

16:00.859 --> 16:02.861
No, you're a decent guy, Cliff.

16:02.861 --> 16:04.363
Maybe I just better go.

16:04.363 --> 16:06.365
No, uh, Madeline, wait.

16:06.365 --> 16:08.367
Uh, look,
I-I-I...

16:08.367 --> 16:12.371
Anything you did, it doesn't
make a difference to me.

16:12.371 --> 16:15.240
You're not just saying
that to make me feel better?

16:15.240 --> 16:17.042
No, I swear it. Scout's honor.

16:17.042 --> 16:20.546
Oh, Cliff, oh!

16:22.548 --> 16:24.550
Oh!

16:24.550 --> 16:27.052
Doesn't it feel good to clear the air?

16:27.052 --> 16:29.555
Oh, yeah, it does.

16:31.056 --> 16:35.561
Look, why don't we
forget about the dinner

16:35.561 --> 16:38.063
and rent a room somewhere

16:38.063 --> 16:41.066
and just celebrate our socks off?

16:45.938 --> 16:47.606
Really?

16:51.026 --> 16:52.528
Well, uh...

16:52.528 --> 16:57.032
well, the, uh, Ritz is
just around the corner.

16:57.032 --> 17:01.537
Why, Cliff, I think
that's a wonderful idea.

17:02.538 --> 17:05.040
Carla, would, uh, you be a dear

17:05.040 --> 17:07.542
and, uh, cancel dinner reservations

17:07.542 --> 17:09.928
for the, uh, Sap party?

17:10.846 --> 17:13.348
We're, uh...

17:13.348 --> 17:16.969
we're going to have, uh,
Ritz service at the room.

17:16.969 --> 17:20.189
(chuckles)

17:22.608 --> 17:24.977
I, uh, I meant Ritz service at the room.

17:24.977 --> 17:28.363
Can you believe I said
"Ritz service at the room"?

17:28.363 --> 17:32.868
What I meant was, uh,
Ritz service at the room.

17:39.658 --> 17:42.494
(phone rings)

17:43.495 --> 17:45.497
Cheers.

17:45.497 --> 17:47.416
Oh, hey, Mr. Clavin, what's new?

17:47.416 --> 17:49.134
Sure thing. Hold on.

17:49.134 --> 17:50.969
Sam, it's for you.

17:52.971 --> 17:53.972
Yeah, Cliff?

17:53.972 --> 17:55.841
Oh, hey, Sammy... Sammy?

17:55.841 --> 17:58.227
It's, uh, it's about to happen.

18:00.095 --> 18:02.481
And y-you stopped to call me?

18:04.933 --> 18:07.436
She's, uh, she's in the john

18:07.436 --> 18:09.938
putting on her best bib and tucker.

18:09.938 --> 18:14.326
Hey, uh, Sam, can I
make a small confession?

18:14.326 --> 18:16.028
Sure.

18:16.028 --> 18:18.197
I'm scared.

18:18.947 --> 18:21.450
Well, Cliff, if it's any consolation,

18:21.450 --> 18:24.703
I've seen her, and I'm scared for you.

18:29.758 --> 18:32.044
Oh, my God...

18:33.962 --> 18:35.881
Oh, Sam...

18:46.225 --> 18:48.110
Slide over, Cliff.

18:55.701 --> 18:57.202
(laughing)

18:57.202 --> 19:00.706
No, I meant this way, Cliff.

19:00.706 --> 19:04.209
Oh. Yes, ma'am.

19:09.915 --> 19:14.920
Now... isn't this wonderful?

19:14.920 --> 19:17.422
Yeah...

19:18.423 --> 19:22.427
I wish the guys in the bar could see us.

19:23.929 --> 19:25.430
Really?

19:25.430 --> 19:27.432
(laughing): Oh, I mean, you know,

19:27.432 --> 19:28.934
it's just a figure of speech.

19:28.934 --> 19:31.436
Uh... uh, they just
think that we're together

19:31.436 --> 19:36.441
because you-you want me
to drop the lawsuit and...

19:37.943 --> 19:40.946
Well, they couldn't be more wrong.

19:41.446 --> 19:44.449
Oh, no, I know, uh... I know.

19:44.950 --> 19:48.453
It's just, uh...

19:48.453 --> 19:51.456
I wish I could, uh...
convince them of that.

19:51.957 --> 19:52.457
(giggles)

19:52.958 --> 19:54.459
I know.

19:54.960 --> 19:57.963
If only that silly lawsuit
were out of the way,

19:57.963 --> 20:00.966
I could focus my total attention on you,

20:00.966 --> 20:02.968
taking you to a height of ecstasy

20:02.968 --> 20:05.470
you never dreamed possible.

20:05.470 --> 20:08.974
Yeah, I could go for that...

20:08.974 --> 20:11.476
but, uh, well, I, uh...

20:11.977 --> 20:14.980
I ripped up that
release form in the bar.

20:14.980 --> 20:17.482
Well, there...

20:17.482 --> 20:19.985
No...

20:20.986 --> 20:21.987
Unless...

20:21.987 --> 20:23.488
Unless what?

20:23.488 --> 20:25.741
Unless... No...

20:25.741 --> 20:27.826
No, what? No, tell me.

20:27.826 --> 20:30.162
Well, I happen to have another copy

20:30.662 --> 20:32.664
of that release form in my purse.

20:32.664 --> 20:33.665
Oh, what a break!

20:34.666 --> 20:38.170
I'm a lucky guy!

20:38.170 --> 20:39.554
Uh, you got a pen?

20:44.009 --> 20:45.010
Oh!

20:45.010 --> 20:49.514
Oh, I feel a terrible burden
lifted off my shoulders.

20:49.514 --> 20:53.518
Oh, yeah. Me, too.

20:53.518 --> 20:55.404
W-W-W-W-What
now?

20:56.188 --> 21:01.193
Well, you just lie back...

21:01.193 --> 21:02.694
Yeah?

21:02.694 --> 21:06.698
And close your eyes...

21:06.698 --> 21:09.201
Oh, yeah!

21:09.201 --> 21:11.954
And I'll check my phone messages.

21:12.754 --> 21:15.257
Uh, excuse me?

21:15.257 --> 21:18.260
Well, I get very distracted

21:18.260 --> 21:22.130
when I haven't checked my messages.

21:22.130 --> 21:25.968
And you don't want me
to be distracted, do you?

21:25.968 --> 21:29.304
(beeping)

21:30.222 --> 21:33.108
Oh, my God!

21:34.059 --> 21:35.944
Uh-oh.

21:40.816 --> 21:43.235
And, uh, she hung up the phone and said,

21:43.235 --> 21:45.737
"Cliff, uh, I don't know how
to tell you this, but, uh,

21:45.737 --> 21:48.156
my husband's come back."

21:48.156 --> 21:49.624
Wait a minute now.

21:49.624 --> 21:52.127
She's married all this
time and never told you?

21:52.127 --> 21:53.628
Yeah. Seems that her husband,

21:53.628 --> 21:56.048
a true and gallant soldier
of these United States,

21:56.048 --> 21:58.467
was, uh, lost and presumed dead

21:58.467 --> 22:01.336
during some, uh, secret mission
out there in the Far East.

22:03.221 --> 22:05.223
Oh, as it turns out,
he was only wounded,

22:05.223 --> 22:07.592
and although he suffered,
uh, years of torture,

22:07.592 --> 22:09.928
see, uh, uh, somehow, he managed to, uh,

22:09.928 --> 22:11.930
dig a tunnel with a pair of chopsticks

22:11.930 --> 22:15.934
and... make his way to a, uh, pay phone

22:15.934 --> 22:17.686
and, uh, give her a call.

22:19.855 --> 22:22.607
Cliff, this is an unbelievable story.

22:22.607 --> 22:24.109
Oh, yeah, Sammy.

22:24.109 --> 22:26.611
It's unbelievable to
me, and I was there.

22:28.613 --> 22:31.116
But, uh, she barely had
time to blow me a kiss

22:31.116 --> 22:33.535
and wish me a happy life, and, uh...

22:33.535 --> 22:36.538
then she was gone...
like a dream in the night.

22:38.040 --> 22:39.541
What a maroon.

22:41.043 --> 22:44.012
I... I guess we were
like a pair of lovers

22:44.012 --> 22:46.014
that were never meant to be.

22:46.014 --> 22:48.517
Like Romeo and Juliet...

22:48.517 --> 22:52.521
Rhett, Scarlett...

22:52.521 --> 22:55.023
Heathcliff, Kathy...

22:57.025 --> 22:58.527
Heath, Cliff and Kathy?

22:59.027 --> 23:01.029
Isn't that three people, Mr. Clavin?
