WEBVTT

00:00.020 --> 00:01.855
Previously on "Station 19"...

00:01.880 --> 00:03.942
- Is that the fire chief?
- Didn't know he'd be here.

00:03.967 --> 00:05.802
Both of you are eligible to apply

00:05.836 --> 00:06.836
for the captain position.

00:06.870 --> 00:08.888
There's written exams,
interviews with your peers.

00:08.889 --> 00:10.923
You will be evaluated
every step of the way,

00:10.957 --> 00:12.758
Moving forward
if you're chosen as captain...

00:12.793 --> 00:13.759
is about being a leader.

00:13.794 --> 00:16.062
Sir, are you all right?
Should you even be here?

00:16.096 --> 00:17.930
His regimen is tough.

00:17.964 --> 00:20.833
I would... would like to
keep going with the treatment.

00:27.974 --> 00:29.675
Have you ever thought
about how many things

00:29.709 --> 00:32.778
in our lives are all about timing?

00:32.813 --> 00:34.847
- You're late.
- I know. I'm sorry.

00:34.881 --> 00:36.015
Lulu flushed her Golden Snitch
down the toilet.

00:36.049 --> 00:39.785
But I managed to fish it out
like the superwoman that I am.

00:39.820 --> 00:40.853
Goodbye, manicure.

00:40.887 --> 00:44.290
Strike a match, a gust of wind,
a floating ember.

00:44.324 --> 00:46.025
You have time to get a manicure?

00:46.059 --> 00:48.394
I make time, Susan. Superwoman.

00:48.428 --> 00:50.796
Oh, Bob, let's roll!

00:50.831 --> 00:52.965
Timing decides if that ember burns out

00:52.999 --> 00:55.434
or if it turns into
a full-fledged forest fire.

00:55.469 --> 00:57.937
Normally, I'd be taking
Isabella to hockey right now.

00:57.971 --> 00:59.472
But instead, I'm here!

00:59.506 --> 01:01.974
Ah!

01:02.008 --> 01:03.242
It almost feels naughty!

01:03.276 --> 01:05.911
Your version of naughty makes me sad.

01:05.946 --> 01:08.781
Oh, Lulu conned the nanny into
chocolate chip pancakes...

01:08.815 --> 01:11.617
You were invited on my party bus.

01:11.651 --> 01:12.685
Your stress is not.

01:12.719 --> 01:14.820
Timing dictates so much
about your family...

01:14.855 --> 01:17.890
It's one day! Lulu will survive.

01:17.924 --> 01:19.425
Your job, your friends.

01:19.459 --> 01:21.994
There. I am all yours.

01:22.028 --> 01:24.763
So often, it's all determined
by being in the right place

01:24.798 --> 01:25.998
at the right time...

01:26.032 --> 01:29.635
Okay, Moms' Day Off has officially begun!

01:33.807 --> 01:37.810
Or at the wrong time.

01:43.783 --> 01:45.351
♪ Good life

01:48.121 --> 01:49.955
This... all of this...

01:49.990 --> 01:51.924
is really working for me.

01:51.958 --> 01:53.492
Well, practice makes perfect.

01:53.527 --> 01:54.994
It's like our little routine...

01:55.028 --> 01:58.664
morning sex, breakfast,
post-breakfast sex,

01:58.698 --> 02:00.266
shower, and then off to work.

02:00.300 --> 02:01.167
What point do I get to leave

02:01.201 --> 02:02.935
using the stairs instead of the window?

02:02.969 --> 02:04.870
When my dad's strong enough
to yell at you

02:04.905 --> 02:06.305
for being here in the first place.

02:08.475 --> 02:11.490
Yeah, chemo's really been
taking it out of him.

02:12.345 --> 02:14.647
You got to skip straight to work today.

02:14.681 --> 02:17.516
I'm gonna get the team together
for a little unity talk

02:17.551 --> 02:20.386
before Frankel corners them all
and makes them pick sides.

02:20.420 --> 02:22.321
Oh, right. Peer reviews are tonight.

02:22.355 --> 02:24.557
Yeah, they should make
a big difference for me,

02:24.591 --> 02:26.358
even after the Incinerator.

02:26.393 --> 02:27.660
I hope they do.

02:27.694 --> 02:31.463
But you do know, it's okay if
Frankel makes the wrong choice.

02:31.498 --> 02:35.000
We still have our sexy
new breakfast routine.

02:35.035 --> 02:36.969
Breakfast and captain, Ryan.

02:37.003 --> 02:39.138
I want it all.

02:39.172 --> 02:40.806
Nothing less.

02:41.908 --> 02:42.975
Shh

02:50.383 --> 02:51.917
You're going?

02:51.952 --> 02:53.852
Fires don't extinguish themselves.

02:53.887 --> 02:54.920
Well, what about a sick day?

02:54.955 --> 02:56.922
Uh, I'm not sick.

02:56.957 --> 02:59.758
And I don't play hooky.

02:59.793 --> 03:01.060
That's not how I roll.

03:01.094 --> 03:02.995
Oh, so you'd rather roll on a twin bed

03:03.029 --> 03:04.663
that shares a wall with
one of your coworkers

03:04.698 --> 03:06.098
over rolling with me?

03:06.132 --> 03:10.703
After this shift, we will have
three days off...

03:10.737 --> 03:11.804
- in a row.
- Mm.

03:11.838 --> 03:15.374
I know, but if you took
today off, it'd be four...

03:16.076 --> 03:17.743
Okay, okay, go!

03:17.777 --> 03:20.179
Go and save people with
those big, big strong arms.

03:20.213 --> 03:22.081
Just...

03:22.115 --> 03:23.882
Just promise me you'll be safe, okay?

03:28.154 --> 03:35.073
Synced & corrected by -robtor-
www.addic7ed.com

03:37.964 --> 03:40.733
Same cocktail as last time.
Sorry if my hands are cold.

03:40.767 --> 03:43.569
Ugh, I never thought I'd spend
my own daughter's peer reviews

03:43.603 --> 03:44.837
hooked up to poison.

03:44.871 --> 03:48.874
I have to sit here all day when
I could be giving opinions,

03:48.908 --> 03:52.077
valuable opinions, about her,
about Jack...

03:52.112 --> 03:54.146
Remember to drink more water
than you think you need, okay?

03:54.180 --> 03:57.082
No one knows either one of them
the way that I do.

03:57.117 --> 04:00.552
Or Station 19, or what it takes
to run the place.

04:00.587 --> 04:02.054
I'll check back in on you in a few, okay?

04:02.088 --> 04:02.988
The department seems to care about

04:03.023 --> 04:05.457
everyone else's opinion more than mine,

04:05.492 --> 04:07.726
as if the cancer's suddenly
taken away my ability

04:07.761 --> 04:11.151
to assess character and leadership.

04:12.198 --> 04:13.332
My thoughts are important here.

04:13.366 --> 04:14.863
They count.

04:15.368 --> 04:16.781
They should count.

04:18.000 --> 04:24.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:27.314 --> 04:28.835
Okay.

04:33.320 --> 04:35.621
Uh, Chief Ripley.

04:35.655 --> 04:37.990
I thought Chief Frankel was
overseeing peer reviews.

04:38.024 --> 04:40.025
I've taken over for her.

04:40.060 --> 04:42.995
I felt she was a little too, uh, biased.

04:43.029 --> 04:45.364
And I want to get my own sense
of each and every candidate,

04:45.398 --> 04:47.166
including the two from this station...

04:47.200 --> 04:49.134
Gibson and Herrera.

04:50.236 --> 04:52.004
Well, I'm happy to help,

04:52.038 --> 04:55.274
though I don't know how valuable
my rookie opinion is.

04:55.308 --> 04:57.009
A rookie opinion is a fresh perspective.

04:57.043 --> 04:59.545
It's very valuable.

04:59.579 --> 05:04.450
Okay, well, um... I'm not gonna lie.

05:04.484 --> 05:07.219
I, uh, I expected this whole
peer review thing to feel,

05:07.253 --> 05:10.022
I don't know, a little
more formal, I guess.

05:10.056 --> 05:13.826
Eh, I just want to get to
know you, know the candidates.

05:13.860 --> 05:17.229
Consider me a clean slate. No pressure.

05:17.263 --> 05:20.041
Just paint me a picture.

05:20.075 --> 05:21.200
Sure, okay.

05:21.234 --> 05:22.534
Starting with this morning.

05:24.070 --> 05:25.037
This morning?

05:25.071 --> 05:26.872
That's what I said.

05:35.849 --> 05:38.150
Another long night with JJ, huh?

05:38.184 --> 05:41.854
I thought I had the stamina, but
that woman does not slow down.

05:43.289 --> 05:44.123
Mnh.

05:44.157 --> 05:47.059
Ugh, wipes out a hangover every time.

05:47.093 --> 05:48.927
- You're hung over?
- I'm about to not be.

05:48.962 --> 05:50.062
Are you good to work today?

05:50.096 --> 05:51.764
You're really asking me that?

05:51.798 --> 05:53.365
I wouldn't be here if I weren't.

05:53.400 --> 05:56.535
Baby, you can't be in less
than full uniform, right?

05:56.569 --> 05:58.103
See? Never slows down.

05:58.138 --> 05:59.738
You forgot this.

05:59.773 --> 06:01.206
Hey, JJ.

06:01.241 --> 06:02.574
- Nice to see you.
- Hi.

06:02.609 --> 06:04.176
You are so on it, baby.

06:04.210 --> 06:06.078
I've never been back here.

06:06.112 --> 06:07.346
Ooh, is that where you sleep?

06:07.380 --> 06:10.048
You know, it's kind of our private space.

06:10.083 --> 06:11.350
Typically, civilians aren't allowed.

06:11.384 --> 06:12.785
Oh. Copy. Copy.

06:12.819 --> 06:14.086
Forget I was even here.

06:14.120 --> 06:15.220
I'll walk her out.

06:19.726 --> 06:22.261
It's so nice right now. No strings.

06:22.295 --> 06:24.096
No hard conversations. Just a fun time.

06:24.130 --> 06:26.098
Is it weird hooking up
in your childhood bedroom

06:26.132 --> 06:28.467
where you hooked up before? I feel
like that would be a little...

06:28.501 --> 06:30.702
Or... That's not weird or creepy at all.

06:30.737 --> 06:31.970
I mean, a bed's a bed, right?

06:32.005 --> 06:32.938
Absolutely. You're grown-ups.

06:32.972 --> 06:35.274
There is no part of this
that's safe or easy

06:35.308 --> 06:37.766
or grabbing onto the past like
a warm, fuzzy security blanket

06:37.801 --> 06:38.813
because everything all around you

06:38.848 --> 06:40.412
is barreling out of control...

06:40.447 --> 06:41.980
What? I said, "It's not that."

06:42.015 --> 06:43.282
Exactly. It's not.

06:43.316 --> 06:45.918
I mean, neither of us is trying
to put pressure on the other.

06:45.952 --> 06:47.453
Ryan and I can go on real dates,

06:47.487 --> 06:48.587
be seen in public.

06:48.621 --> 06:49.788
It's not a secret...

06:49.823 --> 06:51.623
Oh, so Jack knows.

06:51.658 --> 06:53.225
I mean, I'm not broadcasting it.

06:53.259 --> 06:55.227
Mm-hmm.

06:56.463 --> 06:58.263
- Hey.
- Yeah?

06:58.298 --> 06:59.231
We can't have fireflies

06:59.265 --> 07:00.165
just wandering around the fire station...

07:00.200 --> 07:02.501
I know you did not just
call JJ a firefly.

07:02.535 --> 07:04.236
I genuinely like her.

07:04.270 --> 07:05.804
She doesn't belong in our bunk area.

07:05.839 --> 07:07.506
She was dropping off my watch.

07:07.540 --> 07:09.174
But, yeah, man.

07:09.209 --> 07:11.276
Thank you for the helpful heads-up

07:11.311 --> 07:13.645
on what's frowned upon
in our bunk area...

07:13.680 --> 07:15.614
Okay, I wanna hear all about

07:15.648 --> 07:17.583
your hotty hot breakfast with Grant,

07:17.617 --> 07:20.953
right down to the maple-glazed
whatever he served you

07:20.987 --> 07:23.856
because you cannot serve
a satisfying breakfast

07:23.890 --> 07:25.390
without maple glaze.

07:26.392 --> 07:27.392
Oh.

07:27.427 --> 07:29.194
No breakfast. No maple glaze.
I didn't go yet.

07:29.229 --> 07:31.096
What? No!

07:31.130 --> 07:32.764
I was waiting all weekend
to hear how it went.

07:32.799 --> 07:33.932
I journaled about it.

07:33.967 --> 07:35.167
Because that's not weird at all.

07:35.201 --> 07:36.168
Okay, that's not cool, Montgomery.

07:36.202 --> 07:38.203
- I can't believe you'd do that to me.
- To you?

07:38.238 --> 07:40.038
So, Andy and I wanted
to say a few words...

07:40.073 --> 07:42.374
Two words, actually.

07:42.408 --> 07:44.009
We know peer reviews are tonight.

07:44.043 --> 07:45.711
And we just wanted to say in advance,

07:45.745 --> 07:49.381
thank you for whatever you're gonna say.

07:49.415 --> 07:51.683
We know you'll be honest.

07:51.718 --> 07:55.387
And Jack and I, we just really
appreciate you taking the time.

07:55.421 --> 07:56.655
Picking sides feels wrong.

07:56.689 --> 07:57.689
Do we have to?

07:57.724 --> 07:58.891
You don't have to pick sides.

07:58.925 --> 08:01.627
Just tell the truth. Whatever you feel.

08:01.661 --> 08:03.328
- I'm picking sides.
- Good to know.

08:05.231 --> 08:08.634
Station 19 respond.
Motor vehicle accident.

08:08.668 --> 08:11.069
The call was a single-vehicle crash.

08:11.104 --> 08:12.170
A party bus had swerved...

08:12.205 --> 08:15.007
Wait, back up.

08:15.041 --> 08:18.076
To the first call of the shift.
The other MVC.

08:18.111 --> 08:20.479
Oh, uh, well, okay,

08:20.513 --> 08:22.180
that, uh, that was a single vic,

08:22.215 --> 08:23.549
a guy named Peter.

08:23.583 --> 08:28.420
He is... was... just the nicest man.

08:28.454 --> 08:31.857
I was trying to reverse out of the spot.

08:31.891 --> 08:34.927
Turns out... little hiccup...
I put the car in drive.

08:34.961 --> 08:35.994
And the next thing I knew, I...

08:36.029 --> 08:37.996
- Do you know where you are?
- Around the corner from the bakery.

08:38.030 --> 08:40.365
I was picking up croissants for Sandra.

08:40.400 --> 08:42.034
Trying to do the breakfast-in-bed thing

08:42.068 --> 08:43.402
without the whole cooking part.

08:43.436 --> 08:44.836
Follow my finger.

08:46.306 --> 08:48.040
Good. Sandra's your wife?

08:48.074 --> 08:51.209
Mm-hmm. I was trying to get out
and back before she woke up.

08:51.244 --> 08:53.378
Turns out the dumpster had other plans.

08:53.413 --> 08:54.780
Alert and responsive.

08:54.814 --> 08:56.348
Peter, how you feeling? Any pain?

08:56.382 --> 08:58.684
Yeah, my neck and back hurt a little bit,

08:58.718 --> 09:00.252
so I figured I'd call you guys

09:00.286 --> 09:01.720
and hitch a ride to the hospital.

09:01.754 --> 09:03.689
No sign of fire. The engine's intact.

09:03.723 --> 09:05.424
Well, most of us are gonna
head back to the station.

09:05.458 --> 09:07.125
Our medic team will take you
to the hospital, okay?

09:07.160 --> 09:09.261
Okay. Um.

09:09.295 --> 09:11.763
Do you think I'll make it home
in time for "American Bakeoff"?

09:11.798 --> 09:13.231
It's kind of our thing.

09:13.266 --> 09:14.349
I love that show!

09:14.384 --> 09:16.368
The whole station's rooting
for Tommy to win.

09:16.402 --> 09:18.403
- Ooh, Tommy.
- Yeah.

09:18.438 --> 09:19.505
Sandra and I are rooting

09:19.530 --> 09:20.706
- for the other guy.
- Oh.

09:20.740 --> 09:22.140
You think you'll help me, anyway?

09:22.175 --> 09:24.409
Not to worry. We will.

09:26.245 --> 09:28.380
Hey, Warren? Who is it
who ran drills with you

09:28.414 --> 09:30.953
until you got your bottle
stamina up to par?

09:30.988 --> 09:31.984
I forgot.

09:32.018 --> 09:33.719
Uh, Herrera. It was really helpful.

09:33.753 --> 09:36.555
Right, right.
And, Warren, refresh my memory.

09:36.589 --> 09:38.423
Who was it that taught you
how to watch the pipes?

09:38.458 --> 09:39.391
Also Herrera.

09:39.425 --> 09:41.927
- Will you quit campaigning?
- I'm not campaigning.

09:41.961 --> 09:43.595
I am shining a light on your truth.

09:43.630 --> 09:46.131
Your shiny, captain-material truth.

09:46.165 --> 09:48.934
And to remind Warren to shine
a light on that truth

09:48.968 --> 09:50.502
in his peer review.

09:50.536 --> 09:52.304
Peer reviews are out of my control.

09:52.338 --> 09:54.406
Captaining is still in my control.

09:54.440 --> 09:55.841
I'm concentrating on that.

09:55.875 --> 09:58.910
I'm enjoying the job
until the race is over.

09:58.945 --> 10:01.513
- Holy crap.
- Oh, my God.

10:01.547 --> 10:02.614
Get in there fast.

10:02.649 --> 10:05.183
Warren, get Dispatch on the line.

10:05.218 --> 10:07.819
Aid Car and Engine,
we've got an active MVC ahead.

10:07.854 --> 10:09.121
Pull over now.

10:09.155 --> 10:10.155
Warren, what do you see? Call it in.

10:10.189 --> 10:11.256
19 to Dispatch.

10:11.290 --> 10:13.625
We've got an active multi-vic,
single-vehicle MVC.

10:13.660 --> 10:15.027
Multiple additional units needed.

10:15.061 --> 10:16.528
Come on! Move!

10:16.562 --> 10:18.597
Do you think lights and sirens
are for my amusement!

10:18.631 --> 10:19.665
Come on!

10:19.699 --> 10:21.833
Even Aid Car pulls over.
With Peter in the back?

10:21.868 --> 10:24.269
What's our biggest concern
with a crash of this severity?

10:24.303 --> 10:26.204
Blood loss. Patients can
bleed out in minutes.

10:26.239 --> 10:28.674
Station 23, an additional
aid car is en route.

10:28.708 --> 10:30.108
Eight minutes out.

10:30.143 --> 10:31.610
That's too long. Are they kidding?!

10:31.644 --> 10:33.612
Get out of my way! Faster!

10:33.646 --> 10:34.798
What do we do, Warren?

10:34.832 --> 10:36.481
Backup's eight minutes out.
W-We're here now.

10:36.516 --> 10:37.616
We help now, right?

10:37.650 --> 10:39.484
Damn straight we help now.

10:48.594 --> 10:50.162
Herrera was making
decisions in the moment...

10:50.196 --> 10:51.630
necessary decisions.

10:51.664 --> 10:53.465
She didn't have time to hesitate.

10:53.499 --> 10:55.467
Those patients didn't have time.

10:55.501 --> 10:58.170
She couldn't have predicted
what happened in the end.

10:58.204 --> 10:59.471
No one could have.

10:59.505 --> 11:01.394
And what about Gibson?

11:02.175 --> 11:05.577
Gibson didn't agree
with Herrera's decision.

11:05.611 --> 11:08.580
All right, we need eyes
and hands on every patient.

11:08.614 --> 11:11.416
Triage and tag them! Go! Fast! Let's go!

11:11.451 --> 11:14.386
Warren, we grab all the supplies
we can and distribute.

11:14.420 --> 11:16.855
Gibson, stay on Peter.
We can't leave him alone.

11:16.889 --> 11:17.923
We only have one Aid Car.

11:17.957 --> 11:19.858
Yeah, well, we'll have to
make do until backup...

11:19.892 --> 11:21.593
One Aid Car to take Peter
to the hospital.

11:21.627 --> 11:24.362
It's protocol. This crash
is Station 23's call.

11:24.397 --> 11:25.597
They're eight minutes away.

11:25.631 --> 11:27.532
Warren, who needs Aid Car
supplies more...

11:27.567 --> 11:29.067
these crash victims or Peter?

11:29.102 --> 11:30.102
I'd say the crash victims.

11:30.136 --> 11:31.903
We don't know the full extent
of his injuries.

11:31.938 --> 11:33.271
He could have internal bleeding.

11:33.306 --> 11:35.674
He's stable and alert. Keep him that way.

11:35.708 --> 11:37.409
But I'm not leaving these people
here on their own.

11:37.443 --> 11:38.910
We are already on a call.

11:38.945 --> 11:40.779
Captain's orders, Gibson.

11:42.482 --> 11:44.516
Go. Go. Come on.

11:48.338 --> 11:49.786
There was a screeching sound,

11:49.811 --> 11:51.381
and then we're being tossed
all over the place.

11:51.408 --> 11:52.758
Miller, Warren, what do we got?

11:52.783 --> 11:53.989
Cap refills at three seconds.

11:54.024 --> 11:55.215
She's alert with digital movement.

11:55.216 --> 11:56.416
I need gauze and a C-Collar.

11:56.450 --> 11:58.718
Yeah, I got a signpost
through and through over here.

11:58.752 --> 11:59.719
We're gonna need to trim it.

11:59.753 --> 12:01.254
I need a mechanical hand saw.

12:01.288 --> 12:02.555
Ladies, can you tell me your names?

12:02.590 --> 12:03.682
I'm Carla.

12:03.717 --> 12:06.259
What is that sticking out of me?

12:06.293 --> 12:07.527
Never mind, I don't want to know.

12:07.561 --> 12:09.262
That's Susan. Blood makes her queasy.

12:09.296 --> 12:11.030
Why didn't I just take
Isabella to hockey today,

12:11.065 --> 12:12.532
like I always do?

12:12.566 --> 12:14.767
Are you really talking about
her hockey right now?

12:14.802 --> 12:15.969
Miller.

12:17.504 --> 12:19.138
We need to lift the bus off
of Carla, quickly.

12:19.173 --> 12:20.373
No, we do that, and we cram that thing

12:20.407 --> 12:21.474
inside of Susan even more.

12:21.508 --> 12:22.442
It's already impinging on her lungs.

12:22.476 --> 12:23.910
She can't afford for it
to go any deeper in.

12:23.944 --> 12:25.245
Carla's BP is holding steady.

12:25.279 --> 12:26.613
The bus is compressing the wound...

12:26.647 --> 12:28.047
which is a silver lining.
It buys us time.

12:28.082 --> 12:29.148
All right, then, Carla can wait.

12:29.183 --> 12:30.550
We free Susan first.

12:30.584 --> 12:31.684
Then, we lift the bus off of Carla.

12:31.719 --> 12:34.387
If Carla's cap refill rises
or her pulse get thready,

12:34.421 --> 12:35.989
we reassess the plan. Let's go.

12:36.023 --> 12:37.173
- Okay.
- Got it.

12:38.359 --> 12:40.727
I need the O2 kit, more C-collars,

12:40.761 --> 12:42.328
more 4x4s, a tourniquet...

12:42.363 --> 12:43.930
Take it. Empty us out.

12:43.964 --> 12:45.265
So Vic and I can get Peter
to the hospital.

12:45.299 --> 12:46.799
No, there's only one defib.

12:46.834 --> 12:47.934
I'm not leaving these patients
without it.

12:47.968 --> 12:49.035
Take the defib, too.

12:49.069 --> 12:50.270
No, I'm not sending Peter away
without out, either.

12:50.304 --> 12:53.439
And I certainly can't spare
Hughes, or anyone else to drive.

12:53.474 --> 12:54.841
It's all hands on deck.

12:54.875 --> 12:56.242
Take it. Go. I'm good.

12:56.277 --> 12:58.978
Can I help?
I know that's a dumb question.

12:59.013 --> 13:00.013
I just... I wish I could help.

13:00.047 --> 13:01.814
Driver's DOA. We've got
two ejected patients.

13:01.849 --> 13:03.583
Only one conscious. I need a SAM splint.

13:03.617 --> 13:05.652
Tourniquets, Coban, IV fluids.

13:05.686 --> 13:07.020
Was the accident a bad one?

13:07.054 --> 13:08.488
It wasn't a good one.

13:11.376 --> 13:12.892
Is there coffee around here?

13:14.755 --> 13:16.922
Coffee sounds good, doesn't it?

13:17.231 --> 13:18.164
I'll ask.

13:20.760 --> 13:22.794
Oh, hey, could you grab us
a carafe of coffee?

13:22.829 --> 13:24.329
Thank you.

13:27.166 --> 13:29.201
Ohh. Okay.

13:32.205 --> 13:33.705
I have to be honest with you, Hughes.

13:33.740 --> 13:35.140
Now that I've seen
today's incident report,

13:35.174 --> 13:36.842
it's gonna take some convincing for me

13:36.876 --> 13:39.378
to give either one of these kids
the keys to the castle.

13:39.412 --> 13:40.959
Jack and Andy aren't kids.

13:40.994 --> 13:43.482
They sure acted like it out there
today, though, didn't they?

13:43.516 --> 13:45.751
- Breaking protocol all over the place.
- I disagree.

13:45.785 --> 13:48.887
I'm sorry. Is this a peer review
or an incident debriefing?

13:48.921 --> 13:51.690
Because you seem to be focusing
on this one call, when...

13:51.724 --> 13:53.692
A call as divisive
as this is an opportunity,

13:53.726 --> 13:55.260
a lens to examine these two candidates.

13:55.294 --> 13:57.103
- It was just one call.
- And not a very clean one.

13:57.138 --> 13:58.711
- Whose fault is that?
- Well, you were out there.

13:58.736 --> 13:59.881
Why don't you tell me?

14:01.234 --> 14:03.602
Yours. It was your fault.

14:03.636 --> 14:05.570
All of a sudden,
I was airborne, and I thought,

14:05.605 --> 14:08.707
"This is it. The end."
But it wasn't. I'm still here.

14:08.741 --> 14:10.676
Mary, your leg is broken, okay?

14:10.710 --> 14:11.743
Mary, can you squeeze my fingers?

14:11.778 --> 14:12.711
Yeah? Good.

14:12.745 --> 14:13.912
You're in a little bit
of shock right now,

14:13.946 --> 14:14.946
but that's totally normal.

14:14.981 --> 14:16.048
We were turning over,

14:16.082 --> 14:18.116
and then you guys were right
behind us, helping...

14:18.151 --> 14:20.786
Maybe we'll all be okay.
Wouldn't that be crazy?

14:20.820 --> 14:22.454
I can only reduce this leg so much.

14:22.488 --> 14:24.256
She needs to get to the
hospital... they all do.

14:24.290 --> 14:25.257
Where the hell is backup?

14:26.559 --> 14:29.795
Somebody get those sparks!
We can't afford an explosion!

14:29.829 --> 14:30.562
I'll go!

14:30.596 --> 14:32.364
Back me up with the extinguisher.

14:32.398 --> 14:33.565
All right, let's move all stable patients

14:33.599 --> 14:36.635
20 feet away from the crash
in case this bus explodes...

14:36.669 --> 14:37.703
quickly!

14:39.772 --> 14:40.839
I'm taking the defib.

14:40.873 --> 14:42.607
Do you need anything
out of the trauma box for Peter?

14:42.642 --> 14:44.643
- There's only one.
- Peter's good.

14:44.677 --> 14:45.877
Wish I could help out there.

14:45.912 --> 14:47.379
Go! I don't want to be the reason

14:47.413 --> 14:48.747
somebody out there doesn't get treated.

14:48.781 --> 14:50.615
No, someone's got to
monitor you just in case.

14:50.650 --> 14:52.718
It's protocol. You're our patient, too.

14:52.752 --> 14:54.886
- I just wish I could do something.
- You and me both.

14:54.921 --> 14:56.955
Hey, why don't you take my gurney?

14:56.989 --> 14:58.824
They probably need it out there, right?

14:58.858 --> 15:00.625
Please, let me help somehow.

15:02.662 --> 15:04.529
I'll grab you a release form.

15:05.465 --> 15:07.132
We circulate. Red Cards first,
then Yellows...

15:07.166 --> 15:08.800
Yeah, then Greens if backup
still isn't here.

15:08.835 --> 15:09.868
They'd better be here.

15:09.902 --> 15:12.938
I could see my bone.
That doesn't seem right.

15:12.972 --> 15:14.673
There's a bone outside my body.

15:14.707 --> 15:16.441
Mary, it's okay. It's just a fracture.

15:16.476 --> 15:17.309
But I'm gonna give you something

15:17.343 --> 15:18.777
that's gonna help you calm down, okay?

15:18.811 --> 15:20.512
Deep breaths. Deep breaths.

15:20.546 --> 15:23.281
Hey. We got six of the eight
patients here in triage now.

15:23.316 --> 15:24.750
- And the other two?
- Critical.

15:24.784 --> 15:25.817
Still stuck at the bus.

15:27.186 --> 15:28.253
Aah!

15:29.822 --> 15:30.922
Talk to me!

15:30.957 --> 15:32.591
I sawed through a full
two centimeters so far.

15:32.625 --> 15:34.659
But now we wait.

15:34.694 --> 15:36.128
What do you mean, "Now we wait"?!

15:36.162 --> 15:38.830
Susan, the saw heats the metal
as it cuts, all right?

15:38.865 --> 15:40.031
When it get too hot, we have to stop,

15:40.066 --> 15:41.066
wait for it to cool down.

15:41.100 --> 15:43.101
It's piercing your body.
We don't want to burn you.

15:43.136 --> 15:45.437
So, Moms' Day Off?
How many kids do y'all have?

15:45.471 --> 15:47.773
Just the one for me, which is plenty.

15:47.807 --> 15:49.875
I have a daughter, Isabella.

15:49.909 --> 15:52.344
Oh, my God. What if
I don't make it out of here?

15:52.378 --> 15:53.812
We're going to get you out.

15:53.846 --> 15:55.380
It takes a little time, that's all.

15:55.414 --> 15:57.682
If I die here, no one will
take Isabella to hockey.

15:57.717 --> 15:59.518
I always take her. She's so good.

15:59.552 --> 16:01.219
She'll get a scholarship, no question.

16:01.254 --> 16:03.622
Unless I die, and no one pushes her.

16:03.656 --> 16:05.824
And she quits. Then no scholarship.

16:05.858 --> 16:07.893
No college. No prospects.

16:07.927 --> 16:10.061
Oh, God, then what?
Just ruin my daughter's future

16:10.096 --> 16:12.531
because I just had to come out
on this dumb trip!

16:12.565 --> 16:13.865
The trip is not to blame!

16:13.900 --> 16:15.071
Yes, it is!

16:15.105 --> 16:16.868
It's cooled down. Starting her back up.

16:16.903 --> 16:18.870
All right, let me know when
you're most of the way through.

16:20.273 --> 16:21.840
How're we doing?

16:21.874 --> 16:24.209
This open fracture's losing
way more blood that I'd like.

16:24.243 --> 16:25.644
It's barely slowing down.

16:25.678 --> 16:26.812
I need help with a Red Card over here.

16:26.846 --> 16:28.647
Go, I'll try QuikClot.

16:28.681 --> 16:30.348
We really need to get
on the move with these patients.

16:30.383 --> 16:31.850
I know. I know.

16:31.884 --> 16:33.485
Mary, can you hear me?!

16:33.519 --> 16:34.741
Susan, I'm here!

16:34.775 --> 16:37.022
Promise me you'll drive
Isabella to hockey

16:37.056 --> 16:38.657
if I don't make it home!

16:38.691 --> 16:39.825
Why wouldn't she make it home?

16:39.859 --> 16:41.827
Your friends are injured,
but they're stable for now.

16:41.861 --> 16:42.737
For now?

16:42.772 --> 16:45.764
I already told her that I would
drive Isabella to hockey!

16:45.798 --> 16:47.766
And I told her I want Isabella

16:47.800 --> 16:49.768
to actually get to hockey on time!

16:49.802 --> 16:52.204
I'm sorry, I know that's mean,
but you're always late.

16:52.238 --> 16:53.872
Susan, everything's fine. Don't worry!

16:53.906 --> 16:55.607
Hey, hey, Mary, Mary, Mary, stay down.

16:55.641 --> 16:56.875
Just keep your head still, please.

16:56.909 --> 16:57.876
It could make your injuries much worse.

16:57.910 --> 17:01.012
I don't care about me.
My friends over there,

17:01.047 --> 17:03.415
those two, they're like oil and vinegar.

17:03.449 --> 17:04.782
I hold the group together.

17:04.817 --> 17:06.852
You're the glue. That's important.

17:06.886 --> 17:08.395
I'm the glue, too. I'm captain today.

17:08.429 --> 17:09.473
Then you understand.

17:09.509 --> 17:11.790
What your people need are my people.

17:11.824 --> 17:13.425
And my people need their glue.

17:13.459 --> 17:15.627
They need me out there captaining.

17:15.661 --> 17:17.561
But I can't do that
if I'm here keeping you still

17:17.597 --> 17:19.464
so you don't hurt yourself.

17:19.498 --> 17:21.398
Can you stay still on your own, Mary?

17:21.434 --> 17:22.968
Carla's pulse is thready.

17:23.002 --> 17:24.269
We need a new plan here.

17:25.905 --> 17:28.205
Go. Be the glue. Save my friends.

17:28.241 --> 17:29.708
Hughes, tag me out.

17:31.811 --> 17:33.612
We need to get these patients
to the hospital.

17:33.646 --> 17:35.780
Station 23, where the hell are you?

17:35.815 --> 17:38.853
You're the fire chief in
charge of the entire department.

17:38.887 --> 17:39.929
We're all your babies.

17:39.954 --> 17:41.419
- That's the gig, right?
- Yes.

17:41.453 --> 17:43.822
Okay, well, it took Station 23
eight minutes to get to us,

17:43.856 --> 17:44.989
when every second counted.

17:45.023 --> 17:47.559
Even PD beat Station 23 to the scene.

17:47.593 --> 17:48.960
Eight minutes stuck
on the side of the road,

17:48.995 --> 17:52.097
when we should have been
en route to the hospital.

17:52.131 --> 17:53.832
You know what that feels like?

17:53.866 --> 17:55.934
To know that every second
of that eight minutes

17:55.968 --> 17:57.002
could've cost us a life?

17:57.036 --> 17:59.604
Do you know what Station 19's
response time is?

17:59.639 --> 18:01.907
I believe you're at... five minutes?

18:01.941 --> 18:03.174
Yeah, on a bad day.

18:03.209 --> 18:04.843
Three minutes is our fastest.

18:04.877 --> 18:07.012
Station 19 sets the bar
for response times.

18:07.046 --> 18:09.581
So if you can't get the rest
of the department up to speed,

18:09.615 --> 18:11.917
the least you can do is not
give some subpar outsider

18:11.951 --> 18:13.685
the keys to our castle.

18:13.719 --> 18:15.954
So flip a coin if you have to.

18:15.988 --> 18:17.689
But it has to be one of them...
Jack or Andy.

18:17.723 --> 18:19.991
Pick one and be done with it.

18:26.889 --> 18:29.291
Nice to see you, Montgomery.

18:29.325 --> 18:32.961
You look good. More like yourself.

18:32.995 --> 18:36.298
Hard to look your best at your
husband's funeral, I guess.

18:36.332 --> 18:37.866
Can't believe it's been a year.

18:37.900 --> 18:39.560
Next month.

18:40.102 --> 18:41.536
So, how are you doing?

18:41.571 --> 18:43.705
Fine. Holding up.

18:43.739 --> 18:46.192
Glad to see you've found
a new home at Station 19.

18:48.010 --> 18:50.045
That's what I'm here
to talk about today, sir...

18:50.079 --> 18:52.480
Station 19, the captain's race.

18:52.515 --> 18:56.918
Not me, not Michael. If you don't mind.

18:56.953 --> 18:58.320
Of course.

18:59.956 --> 19:01.890
So, do you have a take?

19:05.194 --> 19:08.997
I have strong feelings about
the importance of the role.

19:09.031 --> 19:12.534
A captain keeps the team safe
above all else.

19:12.568 --> 19:17.105
Even the best of teams suffer
under poor leadership.

19:17.139 --> 19:20.101
Of course. Makes perfect sense.

19:21.444 --> 19:22.777
Considering.

19:24.447 --> 19:25.847
Miller, status?

19:25.881 --> 19:26.915
Erratic pulse, clammy skin.

19:26.949 --> 19:28.116
I'm afraid of hypovolemic shock.

19:28.150 --> 19:29.284
We need to move faster.

19:29.318 --> 19:31.586
I'm going as fast as I can.
This metal heats up quick.

19:31.621 --> 19:33.955
I feel lightheaded. It's cold.

19:33.990 --> 19:35.557
Hey, hey, Carla. Cold.

19:35.591 --> 19:37.525
We need you to stay awake, okay?
Stay awake.

19:37.560 --> 19:38.793
Stay awake for Lulu, okay?

19:38.828 --> 19:41.930
She needs you to turn your house
into Hogwarts for her birthday.

19:41.964 --> 19:43.198
You promised!

19:43.232 --> 19:46.134
You got to make sure Lulu turns
into a superwoman like you!

19:46.168 --> 19:48.370
Her BP's dropping. We're out of time.

19:48.404 --> 19:51.039
New plan. We inflate the jack now.

19:51.073 --> 19:52.774
- Susan's not free yet.
- We have to risk it.

19:52.808 --> 19:54.943
Susan's so close. She's stable.
But Carla can't wait.

19:54.977 --> 19:56.311
We're not orphaning anybody today.

19:56.345 --> 19:58.079
Get that bus off of her now!

19:58.114 --> 20:00.148
Thought you could use this.

20:00.182 --> 20:02.050
You left the victim alone?

20:02.084 --> 20:03.918
- You could say, "Thank you"...
- Thanks. Now hustle back.

20:03.953 --> 20:06.221
Okay, Warren, the jack
will jostle the post.

20:06.255 --> 20:08.456
I need you to keep the post
steady, minimize the damage.

20:08.491 --> 20:10.725
- Got it.
- All right, Bishop, go, go!

20:13.162 --> 20:17.432
The day Michael died, he was
working a controlled burn.

20:17.466 --> 20:20.468
He saw an unprotected home, calculated,

20:20.503 --> 20:24.439
decided he could make it
and get out in time.

20:24.473 --> 20:26.007
And he did.

20:26.042 --> 20:27.375
He saved it.

20:29.612 --> 20:31.813
- But then, the wind changed...
- I know.

20:31.847 --> 20:34.983
He made it, through the flashover...

20:35.017 --> 20:36.317
he'd even accounted for that.

20:36.352 --> 20:39.087
But the water drop was off.

20:39.121 --> 20:42.683
The captain had miscalculated by 20 feet.

20:43.225 --> 20:45.460
Doesn't sound like much.

20:45.494 --> 20:46.896
20 feet.

20:47.730 --> 20:52.333
But that miscalculation
cost me my husband.

20:55.871 --> 20:57.505
It cost him his life.

21:02.912 --> 21:05.447
I know better than to settle
for a captain who isn't sure,

21:05.481 --> 21:07.215
and I know better than
to recommend a captain

21:07.249 --> 21:09.184
who I think might miscalculate.

21:10.553 --> 21:12.620
Yeah, it worked! I got it!

21:12.655 --> 21:14.055
All right, get her on that backboard.

21:14.090 --> 21:15.356
We'll save the gurney for Carla.

21:15.391 --> 21:16.558
Susan, nice and easy.

21:16.592 --> 21:18.026
- You okay?
- Am I out?

21:18.060 --> 21:18.960
Oh, my God, I am!

21:18.994 --> 21:21.730
I'm gonna drive Isabella
to hockey myself!

21:21.764 --> 21:25.300
Carla, they're gonna get you
out, too! I know they are.

21:25.334 --> 21:27.168
Give it some more juice, Bishop!

21:32.241 --> 21:33.641
All right, that should do it.

21:33.676 --> 21:35.143
Stop with the inflation.
It's time to get her out.

21:35.177 --> 21:36.177
Copy that!

21:36.212 --> 21:37.412
Sounds... good...

21:37.446 --> 21:39.047
All right, Miller, you pull, I'll pack.

21:39.081 --> 21:40.215
Her pulse is weak,
so we got to move fast.

21:40.249 --> 21:41.082
All right, not too fast.

21:41.117 --> 21:42.684
These jagged metal pieces are tricky.

21:42.718 --> 21:44.886
I don't want to injure her more.

21:44.920 --> 21:46.988
Am I bleeding? I see it, I see it.

21:49.391 --> 21:50.425
Carla!

21:50.459 --> 21:52.393
Mary... I'm here.

21:52.428 --> 21:54.195
One, two... two, three.

21:54.230 --> 21:57.365
Don't worry, I've got her,
but she can't talk right now!

21:57.399 --> 22:01.169
Carla, you're out! Mary, she's out!

22:01.203 --> 22:02.871
- She's crashing.
- No, no, no, no. Okay, Bishop,

22:02.905 --> 22:05.173
give the defib next to
the trauma box now.

22:05.207 --> 22:08.109
I need the ring cutter
from the trauma box right now!

22:08.144 --> 22:10.178
- Go. We've got Carla.
- All right.

22:11.247 --> 22:14.349
♪ And every ray of sunlight

22:14.383 --> 22:15.784
I need more lorazepam from the truck.

22:15.818 --> 22:17.285
Go.

22:17.319 --> 22:19.220
What's happening to Carla?

22:19.255 --> 22:20.255
It looks as though she may
have lost consciousness,

22:20.289 --> 22:22.557
but Captain Herrera's
doing everything possible.

22:22.591 --> 22:24.292
Nobody wanted the bus.

22:24.326 --> 22:25.760
But I made us get it,
because it was safer,

22:25.795 --> 22:27.228
and now...

22:27.263 --> 22:29.230
This is all my fault!
None of this is your fault.

22:29.265 --> 22:31.432
Your driver went the wrong way
onto a freeway off-ramp.

22:31.467 --> 22:34.202
Lulu, Isabella, and...
and Foster... their children.

22:34.236 --> 22:36.604
They're gonna lose their moms
because of me?

22:38.307 --> 22:40.875
I'm so sorry, Montgomery.

22:40.910 --> 22:43.211
Michael was one of the good ones.

22:43.245 --> 22:46.147
I blame that inexperienced captain.

22:47.917 --> 22:49.751
It was so clear in my mind.

22:50.820 --> 22:53.154
The worst thing in the world
happened to me

22:53.189 --> 22:55.390
because of him.

22:55.424 --> 22:57.125
Montgomery, if this is too difficult,

22:57.159 --> 22:58.593
I have plenty of other people to talk to.

22:58.627 --> 22:59.630
I would understand if...

22:59.664 --> 23:01.162
He was supposed to keep Michael safe!

23:04.600 --> 23:07.302
He was supposed to help.

23:07.336 --> 23:08.636
But he didn't.

23:13.809 --> 23:15.109
Charging.

23:15.144 --> 23:16.845
Clear!

23:16.879 --> 23:18.012
Still nothing... damn it!

23:18.047 --> 23:20.612
I'm not done yet. Clear!

23:20.646 --> 23:22.684
Shock delivered.

23:24.620 --> 23:25.681
We got something!

23:25.715 --> 23:26.955
Oh, there you are.

23:26.989 --> 23:28.256
Over here, faster!

23:28.290 --> 23:29.657
She needs fluids and epi.

23:29.692 --> 23:31.759
I've got another patient
with a possible sub-Q air

23:31.794 --> 23:33.194
and open fracture at triage...

23:33.229 --> 23:34.162
We got you. We're here now.

23:34.196 --> 23:35.196
It's about damn time.

23:35.231 --> 23:37.365
You guys are lucky
we happened to be passing by.

23:37.399 --> 23:39.868
You wouldn't be getting anything
but recoveries right now.

23:48.477 --> 23:50.178
Hey, Gibson, you're all clear.

23:50.212 --> 23:51.512
What the hell?

23:51.547 --> 23:53.381
This is why we don't divert
the damn Aid Car.

23:57.219 --> 23:59.220
Now can we go to the hospital?!

24:16.652 --> 24:18.854
A full pitcher.
That's what I like to see.

24:18.888 --> 24:23.425
Sometimes I wonder if I did
my daughter a disservice.

24:23.459 --> 24:26.027
Maybe I should have
pushed her to do things

24:26.062 --> 24:28.663
outside the station growing up.

24:28.698 --> 24:30.432
I wonder about that sometimes.

24:30.466 --> 24:35.504
But as a kid, she never wanted
to spend time anyplace else.

24:35.538 --> 24:38.140
She always knew that
this is what she wanted,

24:38.174 --> 24:41.630
and there was no talking her
out of it, ever.

24:46.983 --> 24:51.052
There wasn't much talking her
out of anything, actually.

25:01.497 --> 25:02.898
We are already on a call.

25:02.932 --> 25:04.833
Captain's orders, Gibson.

25:08.905 --> 25:10.338
A great captain utilizes her team

25:10.373 --> 25:12.407
to the best of their ability.

25:12.441 --> 25:14.476
We were spread thin.
Herrera made it work.

25:14.510 --> 25:17.412
She recognizes people's talent,
puts them where they fit best.

25:17.446 --> 25:20.215
It's how she runs the station,
and it's what she did today.

25:22.051 --> 25:24.553
And how did Herrera
utilize Gibson on the call?

25:24.587 --> 25:26.254
She kept Gibson on the Aid Car.

25:26.289 --> 25:29.491
Smartly, exactly where he was needed.

25:29.525 --> 25:31.393
How long are we thinking for backup?

25:32.628 --> 25:34.196
Actually, is there water on here?

25:34.230 --> 25:35.997
I'm a little parched.

25:36.032 --> 25:38.500
They're on their way. We should
be on the road in less than 10.

25:38.534 --> 25:42.370
Ah, I'd really love to get to
the hospital sooner than later.

25:42.405 --> 25:43.905
I watch enough news. It makes me wonder

25:43.940 --> 25:46.541
about internal bleeding
and sudden death, you know?

25:46.566 --> 25:47.566
Well, I'm right here to make

25:47.591 --> 25:49.077
- sure that doesn't happen.
- Okay.

25:49.111 --> 25:50.612
I treat every patient like family.

25:50.646 --> 25:53.215
So right now, you and me, we're family.

25:53.249 --> 25:55.750
- Aww. Like brothers?
- Yeah.

25:55.785 --> 25:56.885
I'm taking the defib.

25:56.919 --> 25:58.720
Do you need anything out
of the trauma box for Peter?

25:58.754 --> 25:59.621
There's only one.

25:59.655 --> 26:02.591
Peter threw us a curveball, for sure.

26:02.625 --> 26:04.259
Nobody saw that coming.

26:04.293 --> 26:06.428
Herrera could have put
anybody on the Aid Car,

26:06.462 --> 26:07.450
but she chose Gibson,

26:07.484 --> 26:09.431
and it turned out to be the right call.

26:09.465 --> 26:11.900
He was the perfect guy
in the perfect place.

26:11.934 --> 26:14.836
Herrera instinctively knew
to put him there.

26:15.671 --> 26:19.274
It's the least I can do.
Please, take the gurney.

26:19.308 --> 26:21.109
I'll grab you a release form.

26:23.446 --> 26:26.581
You're a little warm. How you feeling?

26:26.616 --> 26:30.218
I guess my neck is stiffer.

26:30.253 --> 26:32.621
Do you have anything
I can take for the pain?

26:32.655 --> 26:34.155
You do have a slight fever.

26:34.190 --> 26:35.557
Oh, should I be worried?

26:35.591 --> 26:38.093
No, I'll make sure the hospital's aware.

26:38.127 --> 26:40.629
Take this ibuprofen.

26:40.663 --> 26:42.430
A double dose for pain and fever.

26:42.465 --> 26:43.965
- Okay.
- You ready?

26:44.000 --> 26:45.400
Oh, yeah.

26:48.871 --> 26:50.505
So, how long you been married?

26:50.539 --> 26:52.607
Ah, in winter, it'll be a year.

26:52.642 --> 26:54.342
So it's new. Congrats.

26:54.377 --> 26:55.574
Hey, get this...

26:55.608 --> 26:58.647
I just realized
she doesn't like mushrooms

26:58.681 --> 27:00.348
just the other day. It's wild.

27:00.383 --> 27:02.284
It's like we're still
getting to know each other.

27:02.318 --> 27:04.252
Yeah, that I definitely get.

27:06.656 --> 27:08.456
I'm gonna run this out,
but I'll be right back, okay?

27:08.491 --> 27:10.258
Go. Help people. I'll be here.

27:17.066 --> 27:18.199
Time to open her up!

27:18.234 --> 27:19.434
Standing by.

27:20.736 --> 27:22.037
Aah!

27:26.475 --> 27:27.509
Hit it!

27:31.213 --> 27:32.445
How are those sparks?

27:32.479 --> 27:33.548
Fully out!

27:33.582 --> 27:35.483
Copy. That's what I like to hear.

27:35.518 --> 27:36.985
Well, you could say Gibson was forced

27:37.019 --> 27:38.653
into an impossible situation,

27:38.688 --> 27:40.855
one instinctively knew could go south...

27:40.890 --> 27:42.390
But he didn't know that.

27:42.425 --> 27:44.159
I mean, no one could have known that.

27:48.497 --> 27:49.597
You can speak freely, Bishop.

27:49.632 --> 27:52.834
No disrespect, sir, but why
is it that men in power

27:52.868 --> 27:55.403
always seem to give each other
the benefit of the doubt

27:55.438 --> 27:57.639
in tricky situations?

27:57.673 --> 27:59.674
I assure you, I am giving
neither candidate

27:59.709 --> 28:01.476
any unmerited benefits.

28:03.079 --> 28:04.157
Right.

28:05.581 --> 28:08.683
So, when the situation
with Peter went south...

28:08.718 --> 28:09.851
Gibson was there.

28:09.885 --> 28:11.753
Things escalated quickly.

28:11.787 --> 28:13.688
Gibson handled it.

28:13.723 --> 28:15.557
All right, that's your
one and only hero move today.

28:18.027 --> 28:19.861
- Peter...
- Sorry.

28:19.895 --> 28:21.496
You weren't supposed to see this.

28:21.530 --> 28:23.498
I-I thought I'd get it all cleaned up.

28:23.532 --> 28:24.728
Uh.

28:25.768 --> 28:27.836
Are you dizzy? Do you know
where you are right now?

28:27.870 --> 28:28.937
Yes! I'm on the side of the road

28:28.971 --> 28:31.005
when I should be at the hospital
getting my medicine!

28:31.040 --> 28:32.874
- Okay, all right.
- I'm sorry to yell at you, Jack.

28:32.908 --> 28:34.542
- I just... I-I really need my medicine.
- It's okay.

28:34.577 --> 28:36.177
Okay, all right, sit down.
Sit down. Sit down.

28:36.212 --> 28:37.278
Let me help you.

28:37.313 --> 28:40.115
Let me help you, all right?

28:40.149 --> 28:42.784
Brothers, remember? Brothers.

28:42.818 --> 28:44.786
- Sit down.
- Right, right. Brothers.

28:44.820 --> 28:46.788
I'm just... I'm in a lot
of pain here, Jack.

28:46.822 --> 28:48.356
I'm really suffering.

28:48.391 --> 28:50.091
You have morphine on here, right?

28:50.126 --> 28:51.693
Y-You know what?

28:51.727 --> 28:52.761
W-We just ran out on our last call.

28:52.795 --> 28:53.895
No, I know you have it.

28:53.929 --> 28:54.929
No, we don't have morphine,

28:54.964 --> 28:57.699
but we... we have, uh, lorazepam.

28:57.733 --> 29:00.135
And you were right. That gurney,
that saved lives today.

29:00.169 --> 29:02.537
All right? I owe you one...

29:02.571 --> 29:03.538
- Okay.
- Okay.

29:03.572 --> 29:04.773
All right.

29:04.807 --> 29:06.541
She knew Gibson could handle Peter

29:06.575 --> 29:08.777
and whatever problems arose.
That is expert leadership.

29:08.811 --> 29:10.545
But the problems that arose
in the Aid Car

29:10.579 --> 29:12.580
were because of Herrera's decision to
ground it in the first place, correct?

29:12.615 --> 29:15.617
But I think if you look at
Herrera's track record...

29:15.651 --> 29:16.918
- at the big picture...
- I have.

29:16.952 --> 29:18.787
Then you that this incident was unusual.

29:18.821 --> 29:20.488
It was messy and complicated...

29:20.523 --> 29:21.656
And Gibson rose to the occasion,

29:21.690 --> 29:24.997
overcoming a problem caused
by Herrera breaking the rules.

29:25.761 --> 29:27.262
Would you agree?

29:30.266 --> 29:32.066
A simple yes or no will do.

29:35.204 --> 29:36.638
Yes.

29:39.495 --> 29:40.908
So, Miller,

29:41.769 --> 29:43.770
you've been at 19 a long time.

29:43.804 --> 29:45.739
You must know Gibson
and Herrera pretty well.

29:45.773 --> 29:47.007
Uh, very well.

29:47.041 --> 29:49.404
Actually, Jack and I go back all the way

29:49.439 --> 29:50.977
to the fire academy.

29:51.012 --> 29:53.146
I got him through Hazardous Materials.

29:53.181 --> 29:55.315
He got me through Resource Deployment.

29:55.349 --> 29:57.751
Uh. Jack's been my guy.

29:57.785 --> 30:00.754
Wow, no need to twirl me
around the dance floor, then.

30:02.390 --> 30:04.624
Why should I make Gibson captain? Go.

30:04.659 --> 30:06.593
Uh, Jack's a quick thinker,
great instincts,

30:06.627 --> 30:09.262
and he's usually 10 steps
ahead of the rest of us.

30:09.297 --> 30:10.630
What's taking so long?!

30:10.665 --> 30:12.832
It'll go faster if I help.

30:12.867 --> 30:14.501
What kind of medicine do they
usually give you at the hospital?

30:14.535 --> 30:15.835
I'm not a junkie, if that's
where you're going.

30:15.870 --> 30:17.037
No, no, no. I know. I know.

30:17.071 --> 30:18.805
I'm just trying to get all the
information so I can help you.

30:18.839 --> 30:20.140
No! No, I don't believe you!

30:20.174 --> 30:21.875
I need my meds, and you are in my way!

30:21.909 --> 30:23.009
Get out of my way!

30:23.044 --> 30:23.944
Aah!

30:23.978 --> 30:25.645
No, wait. Don't pull back.
Don't pull back.

30:25.680 --> 30:28.148
Aah!

30:28.182 --> 30:29.616
My finger! My finger!

30:29.650 --> 30:32.118
This is all your fault.

30:32.153 --> 30:34.287
Aah! Aah! Let go of me!

30:34.322 --> 30:36.022
Look at that. Look. Look.

30:36.057 --> 30:36.990
Your finger's swelling

30:37.024 --> 30:38.858
and your ring is cutting off
the blood flow.

30:38.893 --> 30:40.894
If you don't listen to me,
you're gonna lose it.

30:44.765 --> 30:47.000
I need the ring cutters from
the trauma box right now!

30:47.034 --> 30:48.235
When Jack's on your team,

30:48.269 --> 30:50.670
you feel like you're on the winning team.

30:50.705 --> 30:52.539
I think that's why patients
really love him.

30:52.573 --> 30:55.141
I'm gonna lose my finger!
This is your fault!

30:55.176 --> 30:56.209
Aah, it hurts!

30:56.244 --> 30:57.572
Peter, Peter, clearly,

30:57.597 --> 30:58.979
- you're in real pain.
- Aaah!

30:59.013 --> 31:00.914
I can give you a shot of morphine.

31:00.948 --> 31:04.150
Yeah, if and only if you calm down.

31:04.185 --> 31:06.353
Okay, okay. Okay, I'm really sorry.

31:06.387 --> 31:08.255
It just really hurts. Please hurry.

31:08.289 --> 31:09.656
I know. I know, buddy.

31:11.559 --> 31:13.994
Aah...

31:14.028 --> 31:16.396
Wait, wait. Wait, the orange label?

31:16.430 --> 31:17.539
No, I need the blue label!

31:17.564 --> 31:19.032
- That's not morphine!
- Listen...

31:19.066 --> 31:20.166
Do you think I'm an idiot?!

31:20.201 --> 31:21.601
Are you trying to pull one over on me?

31:21.636 --> 31:22.535
Aah!

31:22.570 --> 31:24.404
Whoa, whoa. What the hell
is going on here?!

31:24.438 --> 31:27.173
You want an explanation, or do
you want to jump in and help?

31:29.243 --> 31:32.078
It's funny. I've known Jack a long time,

31:32.113 --> 31:34.414
but he can still surprise me.

31:34.448 --> 31:35.882
That is funny.

31:38.119 --> 31:39.519
That hurts!

31:39.553 --> 31:41.187
I'm trying to save your finger.

31:41.222 --> 31:43.223
- How'd he get like this?
- I left him alone for a minute...

31:43.257 --> 31:45.358
You want to ride my ass this
morning about bending the rules,

31:45.393 --> 31:46.893
and you're leaving a patient alone?

31:46.927 --> 31:48.595
To help other patients out there.

31:48.629 --> 31:50.363
- I didn't know he was a Seeker...
- That makes it worse.

31:50.398 --> 31:51.498
If Andy didn't divert the Aid Car,

31:51.532 --> 31:54.100
- this never would've happened...
- This isn't Andy's fault.

31:54.135 --> 31:56.236
Gibson sounds like a fine firefighter.

31:56.270 --> 31:57.349
The best.

31:57.384 --> 32:00.640
So you grew up together,
worked side by side

32:00.675 --> 32:05.741
until he climbs to lieutenant,
and now... now maybe captain.

32:06.280 --> 32:08.148
So he... he became your boss.

32:08.182 --> 32:09.182
We work as a team.

32:09.216 --> 32:11.951
Still, a change like that,
you must have feelings.

32:11.986 --> 32:13.887
Well, that's the thing about Jack.

32:13.921 --> 32:17.557
He's made the change feel...

32:17.591 --> 32:20.327
almost imperceptible.

32:24.332 --> 32:25.832
Great.

32:25.866 --> 32:27.133
All right.

32:27.168 --> 32:28.702
Hey, o-one more thing.

32:30.504 --> 32:32.672
Let me ask you, uh...

32:32.707 --> 32:34.311
On today's call,

32:35.843 --> 32:39.412
who did you agree with...
Gibson or Herrera?

32:39.447 --> 32:41.281
I got to sedate him. Without consent?!

32:41.315 --> 32:42.482
It's the only way to save his finger.

32:42.516 --> 32:44.284
Hey, Gibson, you're all clear.

32:44.318 --> 32:45.285
What the hell?

32:45.319 --> 32:47.687
This is why we don't
divert the damn Aid Car.

32:47.722 --> 32:49.589
Now can we go to the hospital?!

32:56.831 --> 32:59.632
It was a multifaceted call.
I mean, you know that.

32:59.667 --> 33:01.534
I'll boil it down for you.

33:01.569 --> 33:04.204
Herrera grounded the Aid Car,

33:04.238 --> 33:07.207
leaving Gibson to care
for the patient inside it.

33:07.241 --> 33:09.642
Do you feel that she should
have sent the Aid Car away,

33:09.677 --> 33:11.778
or should Gibson have handled
that patient differently?

33:21.055 --> 33:22.489
Can you repeat the question?

33:32.910 --> 33:34.711
You did it.

33:34.745 --> 33:36.079
You saved my people.

33:36.113 --> 33:38.548
If you hadn't been driving by...

33:38.582 --> 33:40.316
we might not have...

33:40.351 --> 33:41.851
I'm so grateful the universe put us

33:41.886 --> 33:43.987
on this road at the same time.

33:44.021 --> 33:45.688
Me, too.

33:56.734 --> 33:58.935
I can't believe, after today's call,

33:58.969 --> 34:00.236
everyone's in there

34:00.271 --> 34:03.740
giving peer reviews about us right now.

34:03.774 --> 34:05.742
You ever think about where we might be

34:05.776 --> 34:09.712
if my dad hadn't gone down in that fire?

34:09.746 --> 34:13.750
If we'd never been
called away to that call?

34:13.784 --> 34:15.685
If I never followed you
into the turnout room...

34:15.719 --> 34:18.254
Yeah, we couldn't be competing
against each other right now.

34:18.289 --> 34:20.208
We wouldn't be a lot of things.

34:20.824 --> 34:23.587
Glad it happened, though, in the end.

34:24.428 --> 34:26.429
- You are?
- Found his cancer.

34:28.899 --> 34:31.803
That wouldn't have happened
if the rest didn't happen.

34:32.803 --> 34:34.637
True.

34:34.672 --> 34:36.239
So there's that.

34:39.643 --> 34:42.245
How long do these things usually last?

34:47.650 --> 34:50.719
And in conclusion,
everyone pulled through.

34:50.754 --> 34:52.355
They even saved Peter's finger.

34:54.958 --> 34:57.160
Thank you, Warren.

34:57.194 --> 34:59.662
Your account was eye-opening.

34:59.697 --> 35:02.265
Uh. Eye-opening, sir?

35:02.299 --> 35:05.068
Well, typically, folks tend
to dance around the facts

35:05.102 --> 35:06.136
in peer reviews.

35:06.170 --> 35:08.671
But with that rookie perspective and all,

35:08.706 --> 35:11.674
you were very honest on all fronts.

35:11.709 --> 35:12.775
Herrera broke protocol.

35:12.810 --> 35:15.578
Gibson got into a physical
altercation with a patient.

35:15.613 --> 35:17.147
Okay, no, um...

35:17.181 --> 35:19.582
I'd just like to say that
both Gibson and Herrera

35:19.617 --> 35:21.751
welcomed me when I joined
the station, all right?

35:21.785 --> 35:23.353
They've trained me and trust me...

35:23.387 --> 35:26.107
Yeah, that's... that's kind of the gig.

35:26.524 --> 35:27.590
No, I'm...

35:27.625 --> 35:29.792
Hey, I get it. Thank you.

35:29.827 --> 35:31.161
You're good to go.

35:33.197 --> 35:34.831
I feel like you're not hearing me.

35:34.865 --> 35:37.500
Oh, I hear you. Loud and clear.

35:37.535 --> 35:39.435
Send Hughes in
on your way out, would you?

35:43.807 --> 35:47.610
That, um... That may have
come out w-wrong.

35:47.645 --> 35:49.612
- You just yelled at me.
- True.

35:49.647 --> 35:51.181
So, um...

35:51.215 --> 35:54.551
Let me dial that back and speak instead

35:54.585 --> 35:57.320
about the many specific ways
in which Jack and Andy

35:57.354 --> 35:59.122
have both proven themselves
consistently to be...

35:59.156 --> 36:00.790
You can go.

36:00.824 --> 36:02.358
I haven't given you
my actual peer review.

36:02.393 --> 36:04.894
- I don't want it.
- Y-You don't want it?

36:04.929 --> 36:06.196
You are correct.

36:11.769 --> 36:13.536
I'm the chief of this Fire Department.

36:13.571 --> 36:16.406
I am your bosses' boss' boss.

36:16.440 --> 36:18.508
And the way you have spoken to me,

36:18.542 --> 36:19.909
the insubordination with which

36:19.944 --> 36:22.545
you have approached
this entire interview...

36:22.580 --> 36:23.913
it tells me everything I need to know

36:23.948 --> 36:27.252
about how Herrera and Gibson
have captained you.

36:27.918 --> 36:29.504
So, yes...

36:30.788 --> 36:32.121
you and I are done.

36:33.591 --> 36:35.792
But it's not all about experience.

36:37.094 --> 36:38.361
I've filled in as captain

36:38.395 --> 36:40.330
while Herrera and Gibson were at trials.

36:40.364 --> 36:43.351
It was harder than I expected.

36:43.867 --> 36:45.668
I don't think you can fully
appreciate the job

36:45.703 --> 36:47.731
until you've tried to fill it.

36:48.806 --> 36:51.507
Herrera made a call today
without blinking,

36:51.542 --> 36:52.909
without hesitating.

36:54.945 --> 36:57.880
I couldn't have done the same,
not as quickly.

36:57.915 --> 36:59.284
And Gibson...

36:59.883 --> 37:01.494
he couldn't see it.

37:02.286 --> 37:04.454
He disagreed with her outright
because of a patient,

37:04.488 --> 37:07.523
but hers was the right way to go.

37:08.959 --> 37:11.254
She saved all those people.

37:11.996 --> 37:14.864
Jack wouldn't have. I wouldn't have.

37:18.335 --> 37:21.471
I thought I knew who
I'd recommend for captain,

37:21.505 --> 37:24.642
but that was before I tried
the job for myself.

37:25.643 --> 37:27.520
Jack is excellent,

37:27.911 --> 37:31.941
but Andy thinks like a captain.

37:34.952 --> 37:36.219
She's the better choice.

37:38.822 --> 37:41.324
It'd be a mistake
to see it any other way.

37:44.628 --> 37:45.995
You want to say more about that?

37:46.030 --> 37:47.797
About Gibson? Not really.

37:47.831 --> 37:50.710
You don't like him very much.
I like him fine.

37:51.602 --> 37:53.636
I mean, he's the obvious choice, right?

37:53.671 --> 37:56.172
Frankel thought so. Gibson's good.

37:56.206 --> 37:57.907
He aced his test. He's got seniority.

37:57.941 --> 37:59.909
With seniority comes experience.

37:59.943 --> 38:02.278
He's good with patients.
He's good with the team.

38:02.313 --> 38:04.080
He doesn't micromanage.

38:04.114 --> 38:06.616
He's the guy that'll jump into
a pool full of chemicals

38:06.650 --> 38:08.918
or jump right into cutting
a strip on a roof

38:08.952 --> 38:10.920
because he sees the call as a whole.

38:10.954 --> 38:12.255
And, obviously, you've seen that already.

38:12.289 --> 38:14.157
That's who he is.

38:14.191 --> 38:15.692
He's just like that.

38:15.726 --> 38:16.959
Like a captain.

38:21.031 --> 38:24.000
So are you, by the way.

38:24.034 --> 38:26.936
You recognized the strengths
in those around you.

38:26.970 --> 38:29.939
You know your mind,
and you're true to it.

38:32.843 --> 38:34.677
If a lieutenant spot opens up
at the end of all this,

38:34.712 --> 38:37.180
I expect you to throw your hat
in the ring.

38:39.016 --> 38:41.050
Oh, you can go.

38:41.085 --> 38:42.852
I have everything I need.

38:53.430 --> 38:55.298
Jack would make a great captain.

38:55.332 --> 38:57.900
That's not the question I asked you.

38:57.935 --> 39:01.637
Who did you agree with today...
Gibson or Herrera?

39:06.543 --> 39:07.777
Herrera.

39:09.213 --> 39:10.847
Even given how the call turned out

39:10.881 --> 39:14.150
with a patient almost
needlessly losing a finger?

39:14.184 --> 39:16.686
You still feel she made
the right decision?

39:18.288 --> 39:19.489
Yeah.

39:21.091 --> 39:22.759
Yes, I do.

And by "may," I mean
it definitely happened.

40:15.612 --> 40:17.313
You yelled at Ripley?

40:17.347 --> 40:18.915
I'm... I'm sure it's fine.

40:18.949 --> 40:19.944
Mine didn't go well, either.

40:19.978 --> 40:21.451
Ripley grilled me like a burger.

40:21.485 --> 40:22.952
He's a conversational Jedi.

40:22.986 --> 40:23.986
He took everything I said the wrong way.

40:24.021 --> 40:26.823
I should've listened to JJ
and stayed home today.

40:26.857 --> 40:27.890
She wanted you to stay home?

40:27.925 --> 40:31.494
I ended up saying things,
like, "Gibson's good."

40:31.528 --> 40:34.063
That doesn't even sound like me.

40:34.097 --> 40:35.665
- No offense.
- Some taken.

40:35.699 --> 40:39.001
- Ripley's the worst.
- He squeezed my mind grapes.

40:39.036 --> 40:40.770

to a rough day,

facing off with Ripley. We're grateful.

40:54.885 --> 40:56.986
I just hope he heard me at the end.

40:57.020 --> 40:59.655

in this contest.
