WEBVTT

00:03.087 --> 00:04.952
Eugene: I'm well aware
it sounds bananas.

00:05.131 --> 00:07.087
But looking at the fossil record,
knowing what I know

00:07.258 --> 00:09.169
about this infection,
you cannot say for certain

00:09.343 --> 00:11.595
it isn't what killed off
the dinosaurs.

00:11.762 --> 00:14.253
Now, do I believe
that's what happened?

00:14.432 --> 00:16.138
No.

00:16.309 --> 00:18.971
But it's enjoyable as hell
to think about an undead ankylosaur

00:19.145 --> 00:20.931
going after a diplodocus.

00:21.105 --> 00:23.721
That there is a video game
worth a preorder.

00:23.900 --> 00:26.061
Oh, hell, yeah.
Score.

00:27.320 --> 00:29.276
A few more of those,
a little aluminum foil

00:29.447 --> 00:32.735
and some bleach,
you got yourself some volts, sister.

00:32.909 --> 00:34.900
Homemade battery.

00:35.953 --> 00:38.069
- Here.
- For reals?

00:38.247 --> 00:39.623
You don't want it?

00:39.790 --> 00:41.291
For reals.

00:41.459 --> 00:43.120
Much obliged.

00:43.294 --> 00:45.455
Speaking of video games,
what kind of gamer were you?

00:45.630 --> 00:48.246
RPGs, shmup, sim racing?

00:56.933 --> 00:58.969
(sighs)

01:07.485 --> 01:10.522
Go to sleep.
I got this.

01:10.696 --> 01:14.029
No offense, but I'm not leaving
Eugene's life in your hands.

01:14.200 --> 01:16.191
You came with us
because you wanted help.

01:16.369 --> 01:19.156
You're support,
not point.

01:20.957 --> 01:23.790
We'll move north with you till I find
the right vehicle just off the tracks.

01:23.960 --> 01:25.291
Then five becomes three.

01:25.461 --> 01:28.168
Or two.

01:28.339 --> 01:30.330
We each have
our missions.

01:40.268 --> 01:42.680
You need to get
some sleep.

01:44.480 --> 01:46.721
I haven't seen you
do it yet.

01:50.528 --> 01:52.359
( chuckles )

01:53.739 --> 01:56.697
Thought it was because
you were in love with him.

01:56.867 --> 01:58.573
( chuckles )

02:00.204 --> 02:01.785
A girl in love with a guy

02:01.956 --> 02:04.538
she's trying to help
get to his girl.

02:06.627 --> 02:08.743
If that were the case...

02:10.881 --> 02:14.214
closing your eyes would be
just too damn tragic.

02:14.385 --> 02:16.876
- If that were the case.
- Yeah.

02:19.056 --> 02:20.887
I saw the way you were
looking down Rosita's shirt

02:21.058 --> 02:24.095
while she was
serving you dinner.

02:24.270 --> 02:26.602
Hey, the things
are damn near hypnotic.

02:26.772 --> 02:29.684
( laughs)

02:29.859 --> 02:31.941
Look, Eugene spends
half the day staring at her ass.

02:32.111 --> 02:35.729
I'm not mad, itjust means
my theory's shot.

02:35.906 --> 02:37.897
l'm awfully sorry
about that.

02:38.075 --> 02:40.407
Well, I'm right
and I'm wrong.

02:41.871 --> 02:44.237
Something you did
or something you didn't do?

02:47.501 --> 02:49.537
Something I did.

02:56.302 --> 02:59.044
You were in the army.

02:59.221 --> 03:01.086
| get the whole
gung ho,

03:01.265 --> 03:03.381
mission is your life
bullshit.

03:03.559 --> 03:05.299
Yeah, you do.

03:05.478 --> 03:07.469
Yeah.

03:08.939 --> 03:10.895
So we both
got our reasons.

03:11.067 --> 03:12.773
Both got our missions.

03:16.864 --> 03:19.401
What do you do
when the mission's over?

03:24.747 --> 03:26.283
Eugene:
Been rubbing me wrong, is all.

03:26.457 --> 03:29.369
I'm an even-Steven
type gentleman.

03:29.543 --> 03:31.625
You help me find the supplies,
we'll share the battery

03:31.796 --> 03:34.253
and whateverjuice we scare up,
minimal as it may be.

03:34.423 --> 03:36.288
Deal?

04:17.550 --> 04:19.541
(theme music playing )

04:55.754 --> 04:58.211
(walker snarling )

05:04.221 --> 05:07.213
(snarling continues)

05:10.019 --> 05:12.135
( cans rattling )

05:14.940 --> 05:17.022
Man:
I got it.

05:24.575 --> 05:26.736
(grunts)

05:30.915 --> 05:33.952
(urinating)

05:34.126 --> 05:38.290
Looks like that Robin Hood cat
out out on us after all.

05:38.464 --> 05:41.706
I didn't think he had the sack
to go out on his own.

05:41.884 --> 05:44.591
He don't.
Dude left his stuff here.

05:44.762 --> 05:47.845
Probably just stepped out
to drop a morning deuce.

05:52.520 --> 05:55.853
I think we got about
a day's worth of water left.

05:56.023 --> 05:58.856
We're lucky it's cooled off
a little bit, but...

06:01.278 --> 06:03.018
What are you doing?

06:03.197 --> 06:06.109
- Winning a bet.
- In your dreams.

06:06.283 --> 06:08.695
I'm still on.

06:08.869 --> 06:12.202
( laughs )
You spoke too soon, wise guy.

06:12.373 --> 06:14.489
This might go on
a while.

06:14.667 --> 06:17.124
Maybe we can
speed this up.

06:17.294 --> 06:18.830
Yeah, you're right.

06:19.004 --> 06:20.790
Shouldn't be
fooling around.

06:20.965 --> 06:23.297
We should probably--
Carl!

06:25.761 --> 06:27.217
lwin.

06:27.388 --> 06:29.379
Pay up.

06:38.566 --> 06:41.023
Is that really
the last Big Cat?

06:49.785 --> 06:51.286
Oh, come on.

06:51.453 --> 06:54.581
Hey, but you said
winner's choice.

06:55.791 --> 06:57.827
Go ahead, take it.
It's yours.

06:58.002 --> 07:00.584
You won it
fair and square.

07:06.010 --> 07:08.126
Come on,
we always share.

07:10.389 --> 07:12.175
Fork it over.

07:29.450 --> 07:30.565
( squeals )

07:32.328 --> 07:34.364
What the hell
are you doing?

07:34.538 --> 07:36.119
Catching me
some breakfast.

07:36.290 --> 07:38.076
That's mine.

07:38.250 --> 07:40.832
My arrow's the one
that hit first.

07:41.003 --> 07:42.959
Cottontail
belongs to me.

07:44.965 --> 07:47.126
Been out here since
before the sun came up.

07:47.301 --> 07:50.418
You see, the rules
of the hunt

07:50.596 --> 07:52.712
don't mean jack out here.

07:52.890 --> 07:54.846
Now, that rabbit
you're holding

07:55.017 --> 07:57.508
is claimed, boy.

07:59.313 --> 08:02.726
Claimed whether
you like it or not.

08:02.900 --> 08:05.357
So I was you,
I'd hand it over.

08:05.527 --> 08:07.438
Now before you
get to wishing

08:07.613 --> 08:09.319
you ain't never even
got out of bed this morning.

08:09.490 --> 08:11.105
It ain't yours.

08:11.283 --> 08:14.150
You know, I'll bet

08:14.328 --> 08:16.740
this bitch

08:16.914 --> 08:19.701
got you all
messed up, hmm?

08:19.875 --> 08:21.661
Am I right?

08:21.835 --> 08:25.703
Got you walking around here
like a dead man

08:25.881 --> 08:28.714
who just lost himself
a piece of tail.

08:28.884 --> 08:31.250
Must have been a good'un.

08:31.428 --> 08:33.680
Tell me something.

08:34.848 --> 08:36.884
Was it one
of the little'uns?

08:40.020 --> 08:43.604
'Cause they don't last
too long out here.

08:44.942 --> 08:46.432
- Easy, fellas, easy.
- ( laughing )

08:46.610 --> 08:48.191
Let's just put
our weapons down.

08:48.362 --> 08:50.853
See if we can't figure out
what's really the problem here, huh?

08:54.034 --> 08:56.446
- Did you claim it?
- Hell, yeah.

08:57.830 --> 09:00.697
Well, there you go.
That critter belongs to Len.

09:00.874 --> 09:02.660
So let's have it.

09:05.337 --> 09:08.750
Looks like you may be
wanting an explanation.

09:08.924 --> 09:12.416
See, going it alone,
that ain't an option nowadays.

09:12.594 --> 09:15.085
Still, it is survival
of the fittest.

09:15.264 --> 09:17.004
That's a paradox
right there.

09:17.182 --> 09:20.299
So I laid out
some rules of the road

09:20.477 --> 09:22.809
to keep things from going
Darwin every couple hours.

09:22.980 --> 09:25.096
Keep our merry band
together and stress-free.

09:26.442 --> 09:28.774
All you got to do is claim.

09:28.944 --> 09:30.809
That's how you mark
your territory,

09:30.988 --> 09:32.524
your prey,
your bed at night.

09:32.698 --> 09:34.905
One word, claimed.

09:35.075 --> 09:37.282
I ain't claiming nothing.

09:37.453 --> 09:39.569
We're gonna
teach him, right?

09:41.623 --> 09:44.080
The rules say
we got to teach him.

09:46.462 --> 09:48.669
It wouldn't be fair
to punish you

09:48.839 --> 09:50.579
for violating a rule
you never even knew existed.

09:50.758 --> 09:52.498
There ain't
no rules no more.

09:52.676 --> 09:55.167
Oh, there are.
You know that.

09:55.345 --> 09:58.007
That's why I didn't kill you
for the crossbow.

10:01.018 --> 10:03.475
- Hey.
- Easy there, partner.

10:16.116 --> 10:17.652
Claimed.

10:17.826 --> 10:20.033
That's all
you got to say.

10:20.204 --> 10:22.536
Hey, ass end
is still an end.

10:38.722 --> 10:41.589
Hold up!

10:41.767 --> 10:44.304
We're stopping here.

10:44.478 --> 10:46.969
Tired is slow.

10:47.147 --> 10:49.809
- Slow is dead.
- It's barely noon.

10:49.983 --> 10:51.769
I don't give
a monkey's left nut.

10:51.944 --> 10:53.980
None of us has slept more
than a couple hours straight

10:54.154 --> 10:56.395
since we went
all Casey Jones.

10:56.573 --> 10:58.438
This place looks safe.

10:58.617 --> 11:01.154
We need to rest.

11:01.328 --> 11:04.286
| get it.
You have to find her.

11:04.456 --> 11:06.697
Well, Rosita and me,
we got a mission, too.

11:06.875 --> 11:09.036
It's keeping that man alive,
getting him to Washington,

11:09.211 --> 11:11.452
and saving
the whole damn world.

11:11.630 --> 11:14.542
So we're going in that tower
and we're going now.

11:14.716 --> 11:16.877
(walkers snarling )

11:18.554 --> 11:20.840
- Oh, crap.
- Hey, hey, hey, watch out!

11:21.014 --> 11:22.003
Abraham:
Go, go!

11:22.182 --> 11:25.265
- Go!
- Move! Move!

11:30.649 --> 11:33.686
- Rosita: Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

11:33.861 --> 11:36.102
We got to stay here.
Who's gonna help me carry her up?

11:36.280 --> 11:37.645
- You okay?
- Yeah.

11:37.823 --> 11:38.983
You wanna stop
or you wanna keep going?

11:39.157 --> 11:40.146
No, keep going.
I'm good.

11:40.325 --> 11:42.111
- You sure?
- Yeah. Yeah.

11:42.286 --> 11:46.120
Look, if she can keep going,
we can all keep going.

11:48.584 --> 11:51.747
Or you guys
can stay here.

11:51.920 --> 11:53.581
You don't need us,
we don't need you.

11:53.755 --> 11:56.462
- It's okay.
- Rosita: Wow, you're an ass.

11:56.633 --> 12:00.467
She will do whatever you say
because she thinks she owes you.

12:00.637 --> 12:02.298
Man up.

12:02.472 --> 12:05.088
Stay here for a few hours.

12:07.352 --> 12:09.684
You just care about
keeping Eugene safe, right?

12:09.855 --> 12:12.221
It's the only reason
you want to stop?

12:12.399 --> 12:14.139
We go until sundown,

12:14.318 --> 12:16.934
I give Eugene my riot gear
right here, right now.

12:17.112 --> 12:18.977
- Everybody wins.
- Except her.

12:19.156 --> 12:21.147
You're not her mama.

12:25.037 --> 12:27.699
She says she can walk,
she can walk.

12:32.044 --> 12:34.035
You got yourself a deal.

12:34.212 --> 12:36.123
Okay.

12:40.218 --> 12:42.834
- So what's the plan, Daryl?
- How so?

12:43.013 --> 12:45.504
You're with us now,
but you ain't soon?

12:45.682 --> 12:47.343
Yep.

12:47.517 --> 12:49.678
So what's the plan?

12:53.231 --> 12:55.358
Just looking for
the right place is all.

12:55.525 --> 12:58.358
Oh, we ain't good
enough for you, huh?

12:58.528 --> 13:01.270
Some of you ain't
exactly friendly.

13:02.824 --> 13:05.611
You ain't
so friendly yourself.

13:05.786 --> 13:07.947
You know you need
a group out here.

13:08.121 --> 13:11.238
- Maybe I don't.
- No, you do.

13:11.416 --> 13:13.202
You should be with us.

13:13.377 --> 13:15.618
(walker snarling )

13:17.089 --> 13:19.296
Joe:
People don't got to be friendly.

13:19.466 --> 13:22.583
We don't have to be nice.
We don't have to be brothers in arms.

13:22.761 --> 13:24.717
(snarling )

13:32.270 --> 13:34.761
We just got
to follow the rules.

13:36.108 --> 13:38.064
You claim.

13:38.235 --> 13:40.100
If you steal,
you keel.

13:40.278 --> 13:41.688
I know that sounds
a little funny,

13:41.863 --> 13:43.694
but nobody laughs
when something goes missing.

13:43.865 --> 13:46.026
And you don't lie.

13:46.201 --> 13:48.988
'Cause that's
a slippery slope indeed.

13:49.162 --> 13:51.244
What happens
if you break 'em?

13:52.833 --> 13:55.415
Oh, you catch a beatin'.

13:55.585 --> 13:58.577
The severity of which
depends upon the offense

13:58.755 --> 14:01.838
and the general attitude
of the day.

14:02.009 --> 14:03.590
But that don't
happen much

14:03.760 --> 14:07.673
'cause when men
like us follow rules

14:07.848 --> 14:09.634
and cooperate
a little bit,

14:09.808 --> 14:12.094
well, the world
becomes ours.

14:12.269 --> 14:13.850
( whistles )
Right there.

14:14.021 --> 14:16.933
It's our abode
for the evening.

14:17.107 --> 14:18.813
Hey.

14:18.984 --> 14:20.599
There ain't no us.

14:23.697 --> 14:26.029
You leaving right now?

14:29.161 --> 14:31.026
No?

14:31.204 --> 14:33.866
Then it sure seems
like there's an us.

14:40.714 --> 14:42.500
You a cat person, Daryl?

14:42.674 --> 14:44.289
lam.

14:44.468 --> 14:45.958
Loved 'em since
I was three years old.

14:46.136 --> 14:48.422
Vicious creatures.

14:48.597 --> 14:49.928
Anyway, I'll tell you,

14:50.098 --> 14:51.759
and this is true,

14:51.933 --> 14:54.015
ain't nothing sadder
than an outdoor cat

14:54.186 --> 14:56.177
that thinks
he's an indoor cat.

15:30.347 --> 15:32.008
We're gaining on 'em.

15:32.182 --> 15:33.922
Still wet.

15:34.101 --> 15:36.808
We sure as Shinola
can't go up and over.

15:36.978 --> 15:39.936
(walkers snarling )

15:43.026 --> 15:45.062
How about around?

15:45.237 --> 15:47.068
No.

15:47.239 --> 15:49.946
That'll take a day,
maybe more.

15:50.117 --> 15:52.483
lf Maggie went through,
I'm going through.

15:52.661 --> 15:55.277
- We're close.
- Shut up a second.

15:55.455 --> 15:59.198
- ( snarling continues)
- You hear that?

15:59.376 --> 16:02.618
That there
is a long, dark tunnel

16:02.796 --> 16:05.082
full of reanimated corpses.

16:07.467 --> 16:09.207
I don't have
full-on certainty

16:09.386 --> 16:11.422
that I can get Eugene
through there alive.

16:11.596 --> 16:14.588
My recommendation
would be take the day,

16:14.766 --> 16:16.757
make the detour
and play it safe,

16:16.935 --> 16:19.517
but I know you're not
gonna do that.

16:19.688 --> 16:22.896
So this is where
we've got to part ways.

16:23.066 --> 16:24.602
I'm sorry.

16:25.735 --> 16:27.236
You're on your own.

16:29.573 --> 16:32.235
No, you're not.

16:35.787 --> 16:37.243
No, no, no.
Those are yours.

16:37.414 --> 16:38.995
You guys will need them
for your trip.

16:39.166 --> 16:41.031
You will, too.

16:46.756 --> 16:48.963
Thank you.

16:57.601 --> 16:59.557
Sorry, I...

16:59.728 --> 17:01.343
hit you in the face.

17:01.521 --> 17:03.807
I'm not.

17:03.982 --> 17:06.348
I like to fight.

17:12.991 --> 17:15.107
Good luck.

17:18.121 --> 17:20.203
Try not to be an ass.

17:27.130 --> 17:30.622
You're both good people.

17:33.428 --> 17:36.090
l have to say that you
are seriously hot, Tara.

17:37.557 --> 17:39.513
Yeah, I like girls.

17:41.144 --> 17:43.556
I'm well aware of that.

17:47.651 --> 17:50.563
Say you get into
trouble in there.

17:50.737 --> 17:52.819
You turn around.

17:52.989 --> 17:54.980
We're doubling back
to the first road we crossed.

17:55.158 --> 17:58.446
Maybe you find us
before we find the right ride.

17:58.620 --> 17:59.860
Thanks.

18:11.591 --> 18:13.377
Hey.

18:13.551 --> 18:15.166
I know what
you're going through.

18:22.936 --> 18:25.678
After this all started,

18:25.855 --> 18:28.642
afterl realized
I'd never see my family,

18:28.817 --> 18:31.058
my friends again,

18:31.236 --> 18:33.101
lwas numb.

18:33.280 --> 18:35.316
All day long,
just numb.

18:38.159 --> 18:40.320
I'm just saying
I get it.

18:45.750 --> 18:48.036
When Brian told us
he wanted to take over the prison,

18:48.211 --> 18:51.044
I knew it sounded bad.

18:51.214 --> 18:54.001
When I found my girlfriend,
she was dead.

18:54.175 --> 18:55.585
My niece.

18:55.760 --> 18:58.092
My sister,

18:58.263 --> 19:00.925
she was surrounded,
pounced on.

19:01.099 --> 19:03.556
I saw it happen.

19:03.727 --> 19:05.718
But still, it wasn't
as bad as seeing

19:05.895 --> 19:08.022
what he did
to Maggie's father.

19:18.241 --> 19:20.277
Because that's when I knew.

19:25.081 --> 19:27.367
That second the sword--

19:30.962 --> 19:33.795
I wanted to scream "no,"
but it just happened.

19:33.965 --> 19:37.503
Brian said we might
have to kill people.

19:37.677 --> 19:40.168
lwas the first
tojump in.

19:43.975 --> 19:45.761
l was just hanging
on the "might."

20:15.048 --> 20:16.879
They ain't here.

20:17.050 --> 20:19.166
Nobody's been here
for a while.

20:19.344 --> 20:21.710
Whoever was,
they got all the gas.

20:21.888 --> 20:23.219
That don't matter.

20:23.390 --> 20:24.971
We're getting closer.
I can feel it.

20:25.141 --> 20:27.427
Claimed.

20:28.978 --> 20:31.139
Claimed.

20:32.690 --> 20:34.305
Claimed.

20:37.070 --> 20:38.856
Claimed.

20:39.030 --> 20:41.021
Claimed.

20:58.591 --> 21:00.627
(walkers snarling )

21:49.309 --> 21:51.265
The blood is still wet.

21:51.436 --> 21:53.927
This had to have
happened today.

22:04.574 --> 22:06.439
Hold this.

23:28.783 --> 23:31.445
Glenn.
What are you doing?

23:31.619 --> 23:34.577
- She's not one of them.
- What?

23:38.001 --> 23:39.332
There's no bodies
on the ground.

23:39.502 --> 23:41.743
That means Maggie
made it through.

23:42.964 --> 23:44.454
She made it through.

23:46.759 --> 23:48.966
We have to
get rid of them.

23:49.137 --> 23:51.344
- We don't have enough ammo.
- Then we'll push through.

23:51.514 --> 23:53.846
We have to find
another way.

24:03.860 --> 24:05.691
( exhales )

24:05.862 --> 24:07.693
(snarling )

24:07.864 --> 24:09.855
(pounding)

24:12.702 --> 24:14.192
You got him?

24:15.204 --> 24:16.740
lgothen

24:29.969 --> 24:32.711
(engine starts)

24:32.889 --> 24:34.800
Gonna need to air
this baby out.

24:34.974 --> 24:38.637
Good, it'll give us some time to figure
out how to get back on track.

24:53.326 --> 24:54.987
- Yo, no, no.
- I'm the navigator.

24:55.161 --> 24:57.277
Then learn to navigate.

24:57.455 --> 24:59.537
Remember Thompson?

24:59.707 --> 25:03.666
I'm formally requesting
a straight up do-over on that one.

25:03.836 --> 25:06.828
l guided us here from Houston
to northern Georgia without incident.

25:07.006 --> 25:08.871
I wouldn't say
without incident.

25:09.050 --> 25:10.506
Minimal incident.

25:10.677 --> 25:12.087
Navigation-wise,
at least.

25:15.765 --> 25:17.471
Please?

25:17.642 --> 25:19.507
I cannot abide a reality

25:19.686 --> 25:22.553
where you are the chosen navigator
over a son of the South

25:22.730 --> 25:24.766
who has successfully
negotiated the travails

25:24.941 --> 25:27.273
and vagaries ofjourneys
both real and virtual.

25:34.325 --> 25:36.441
All right.

25:36.619 --> 25:38.951
We're going north.
Got it?

25:41.958 --> 25:43.994
(snarling )

26:31.340 --> 26:34.673
Tara. What is it?
What is it?

26:34.844 --> 26:37.677
I can't--
( grunting )

26:41.934 --> 26:43.890
Get up, get up,
get up.

26:52.987 --> 26:54.443
Eugene:
Turn left up here.

26:54.614 --> 26:55.945
This is the third
left turn

26:56.115 --> 26:58.231
you've made me make
in the last five minutes.

26:58.409 --> 27:00.525
- You're lost.
- I'm not.

27:00.703 --> 27:02.694
Turn left.

27:04.165 --> 27:05.655
If you're lost,
please just tell me.

27:05.833 --> 27:08.700
The gas in this tank
is worth more than your ego.

27:08.878 --> 27:10.584
If you want to talk
fuel efficiency, we could talk--

27:10.755 --> 27:12.370
We are not rolling up
the windows.

27:12.548 --> 27:15.005
- It smells like a damn carcass in here.
- Stop the van.

27:17.637 --> 27:19.502
Why are we stopping?

27:26.938 --> 27:29.020
Mentiroso.

27:29.190 --> 27:31.431
Ugh, liar!

27:31.609 --> 27:32.849
Nope.

27:33.027 --> 27:34.767
This wasn't your plan?

27:34.946 --> 27:36.561
Why you insisted
on navigating?

27:36.739 --> 27:38.240
Why you told him
to go to sleep?

27:38.407 --> 27:40.443
Nope. I never
claimed otherwise.

27:40.618 --> 27:42.449
Now how about you
apologize for the slander

27:42.620 --> 27:44.201
and we call it square?

27:45.540 --> 27:47.030
What the hell
is wrong with you?

27:47.208 --> 27:48.948
lf Glenn and Tara
were still alive

27:49.126 --> 27:50.832
and there were
no significant delays

27:51.003 --> 27:53.665
and they continued traveling
at approximately three miles per hour

27:53.840 --> 27:56.627
and l timed it
correctly in my head,

27:56.801 --> 27:58.382
they might be
somewhere around here.

27:58.553 --> 28:01.090
Those two are not
the priority.

28:01.264 --> 28:04.381
The only priority
is getting you to Washington.

28:04.559 --> 28:06.925
After I save
the world,

28:07.103 --> 28:09.264
I still have to live
with myself.

28:10.690 --> 28:12.772
I'm not leaving
them behind.

28:14.026 --> 28:16.859
Oh!
Son of a bitch!

28:18.406 --> 28:19.896
Why the hell
are we stopped?

28:20.074 --> 28:22.406
If they made it out of that tunnel,
they'd be somewhere around here.

28:22.577 --> 28:24.784
You're kidding me, right?

28:24.954 --> 28:27.491
What's your problem?

28:27.665 --> 28:29.451
- My problem?
- You're the one in the driver's seat.

28:29.625 --> 28:31.581
You're the one who put
your damn foot on the brake.

28:31.752 --> 28:34.539
- He told me to stop.
- You don't stop! You never stop!

28:34.714 --> 28:35.703
I know the rules.

28:35.882 --> 28:37.622
If you know the rules,
the rule is never stop!

28:37.800 --> 28:39.756
- When you stop...
- Guys!

28:39.927 --> 28:41.918
- Guys!
- Both: What?

28:44.765 --> 28:46.926
Len:
You've got to be kidding me.

28:47.101 --> 28:49.638
Christ.

28:49.812 --> 28:51.643
Give it here.

28:51.814 --> 28:53.645
You step back.

28:53.816 --> 28:56.182
My half was in the bag.
Now it's gone.

28:56.360 --> 28:59.147
Now ain't nobody
around here interested

28:59.322 --> 29:03.031
in no half a damn cottontail except you.
Ain't that right?

29:03.200 --> 29:04.986
You're the only one
still thinking about that crap.

29:05.161 --> 29:07.903
- Empty your bag.
- I said step back.

29:18.674 --> 29:20.539
Just tell me the truth.

29:20.718 --> 29:22.299
I didn't take nothing.

29:22.470 --> 29:24.256
Joe:
What do we got here?

29:26.140 --> 29:27.880
Come on.

29:31.062 --> 29:34.350
- Well, look at that.
- You put that there, didn't you?

29:34.523 --> 29:36.059
When I went out
to take a piss.

29:36.233 --> 29:37.564
- You lied.
- Didn't you?

29:37.735 --> 29:40.442
You lied.
You stole.

29:40.613 --> 29:43.821
- We gonna teach this fool or what, Joe?
- Whoa, whoa.

29:43.991 --> 29:46.733
Now, Daryl says
he didn't take your half of the rabbit.

29:46.911 --> 29:48.492
So we got a little
conundrum here.

29:48.663 --> 29:49.994
Either he's lying,

29:50.164 --> 29:52.450
which is
an actionable offense,

29:52.625 --> 29:55.287
or...
( laughs)

29:55.461 --> 29:59.079
you didn't plant it
on him like some pussy,

29:59.256 --> 30:02.043
punk-ass, cheating,
coward cop, did you?

30:02.218 --> 30:05.710
'Cause while that wouldn't be
specifically breaking the rules,

30:05.888 --> 30:08.049
it'd be disappointing.

30:08.224 --> 30:10.215
- It would.
- Mm-hmm.

30:10.393 --> 30:12.725
- I didn't.
- Good.

30:13.771 --> 30:15.386
Well...

30:15.564 --> 30:18.522
- ( groans )
- ...teach him a lesson, gents.

30:18.693 --> 30:21.025
He's a lying sack of shit.
I'm sick of it.

30:21.195 --> 30:23.151
Teach him all the way.

30:24.448 --> 30:27.064
I saw him do it.

30:27.243 --> 30:28.574
Why didn't you try
to stop him?

30:28.744 --> 30:32.236
He wanted to play that out.
I let him.

30:32.415 --> 30:34.576
You told the truth.

30:34.750 --> 30:36.615
He lied.

30:36.794 --> 30:38.534
You understand the rules.

30:38.713 --> 30:40.078
He doesn't.

30:40.256 --> 30:42.668
-( blows landing)
- ( Len groaning)

30:44.343 --> 30:46.629
Looks like you get
the head, too.

30:57.606 --> 31:00.348
(straining)

31:00.526 --> 31:01.936
( panting )

31:04.947 --> 31:07.279
Go. Go.

31:07.450 --> 31:10.032
Find Maggie.
Go find Maggie.

31:10.202 --> 31:11.988
No, no.

31:12.163 --> 31:15.200
- No.
- Glenn, you can't save me.

31:15.374 --> 31:16.784
(straining)

31:16.959 --> 31:18.699
Even if you got this
off me, I can't run.

31:18.878 --> 31:20.789
And if you help me,
they're gonna get both of us.

31:20.963 --> 31:23.579
There's got to be a way.
There's got to be a different way.

31:23.758 --> 31:25.669
Glenn, they're coming.

31:25.843 --> 31:27.583
I'm not leaving.
I'm not leaving you!

31:27.762 --> 31:30.674
Get out of here!

31:30.848 --> 31:32.384
Go!

31:34.560 --> 31:36.642
No.

31:43.986 --> 31:46.272
(gun clicking)

31:46.447 --> 31:48.312
Come on!

31:49.992 --> 31:51.402
- ( engine rewing)
- Come on!

31:51.577 --> 31:53.784
- ( tires squeal )
- ( gunfire)

31:53.954 --> 31:55.615
Abraham:
Get down!

31:55.790 --> 31:57.326
(gunfire)

32:22.942 --> 32:25.479
(crying)

32:28.864 --> 32:31.150
Oh, my God.

32:41.919 --> 32:43.409
Hi.

32:43.587 --> 32:45.373
Hi.

32:59.728 --> 33:01.719
God, you are
so beautiful.

33:04.191 --> 33:06.603
- How'd it go?
- End of the tunnel's secure.

33:06.777 --> 33:09.268
If anything tries to come in,
we'll hear in plenty of time.

33:09.446 --> 33:11.232
We didn't get
to officially meet.

33:11.407 --> 33:14.570
Oh, I'm sorry.
Tara, this is Maggie.

33:14.743 --> 33:16.244
- Maggie, Tara.
- Hi.

33:16.412 --> 33:18.243
Hi.

33:20.666 --> 33:22.577
He's a big
fan of yours.

33:25.171 --> 33:27.127
I met Tara on the road.

33:27.298 --> 33:29.505
Couldn't have made it
here without her.

33:31.051 --> 33:33.042
Thank you.

33:38.434 --> 33:41.392
When she heard what I was doing,
she said she had to help me.

33:41.562 --> 33:43.177
She's just
that kind of person.

34:01.582 --> 34:02.947
What's up?

34:03.125 --> 34:05.662
He just said

34:05.836 --> 34:08.418
that he knows
what caused the outbreak.

34:10.216 --> 34:12.207
Yeah.

34:13.302 --> 34:15.884
He does.

34:16.055 --> 34:19.138
Let me guess.
He asked you to go to DC with him?

34:19.308 --> 34:21.890
l'm downright tickled
y'all found each other.

34:22.061 --> 34:25.553
Should spend the rest
of the night celebrating.

34:25.731 --> 34:28.768
Because tomorrow
there's absolutely no reason

34:28.943 --> 34:30.433
why the eight of us
don't stuff ourselves

34:30.611 --> 34:32.192
in that van and head up
to Washington.

34:32.363 --> 34:34.570
Tara:
He's right.

34:34.740 --> 34:37.652
I'm gonna go.

34:37.826 --> 34:40.203
No, he's wrong.

34:40.371 --> 34:43.704
We're 55% of the way
from Houston to Washington.

34:43.874 --> 34:45.956
Up until now, we've had
an armored military vehicle

34:46.126 --> 34:47.502
for transport
and we lost eight people.

34:47.670 --> 34:50.833
- That wasn't our fault.
- They're gone.

34:51.006 --> 34:52.462
Eugene:
I can't imagine we'd have better luck

34:52.633 --> 34:55.045
with that grocery grabber
we picked up.

34:55.219 --> 34:56.800
We're a day's walk
from Terminus.

34:56.971 --> 34:58.836
Who knows what
they've got there?

34:59.014 --> 35:01.175
Rosita:
Look, it couldn't hurt to check.

35:01.350 --> 35:02.590
Load up on supplies,

35:02.768 --> 35:05.726
maybe even recruit
some of them to come with.

35:05.896 --> 35:09.388
I'll go with you guys,
but after.

35:09.566 --> 35:11.352
l have to see Terminus.

35:12.987 --> 35:15.194
My brother
could be there.

35:15.364 --> 35:17.229
I got to know.

35:17.408 --> 35:19.820
Me, too.

35:19.994 --> 35:21.905
On both counts.

35:24.164 --> 35:26.416
He tells me
I'm wrong...

35:30.504 --> 35:32.995
| listen.

35:33.173 --> 35:35.550
Tomorrow we go
to the end of the line.

35:37.553 --> 35:39.384
Then Washington.

35:42.057 --> 35:43.388
I can't believe it.

35:43.559 --> 35:46.050
I know.
We were right over there.

35:46.228 --> 35:48.719
A whole swarm of them
came at us.

35:50.524 --> 35:52.890
And we didn't have
enough bullets.

35:55.863 --> 35:58.275
I tried to think what you would
do if you were here.

36:00.200 --> 36:02.236
So ljust emptied my clip
into the ceiling

36:02.411 --> 36:03.742
and I hoped for the best.

36:03.912 --> 36:05.903
That's unreal.

36:06.081 --> 36:07.742
Kind of like asking
those guys to hold off

36:07.916 --> 36:09.372
saving the world while you go look
for your wife?

36:09.543 --> 36:11.079
( laughs)

36:11.253 --> 36:13.414
I'm a persuasive guy.

36:13.589 --> 36:15.250
Yeah.

36:48.165 --> 36:50.702
Whoa, hey.
What are you doing?

36:50.876 --> 36:52.582
Sorry.

36:52.753 --> 36:54.960
This is the only picture
I have of you.

36:55.130 --> 36:58.463
You don't need
a picture of me.

36:59.551 --> 37:01.633
You never will again.

37:19.571 --> 37:21.607
( loud clang )

37:34.169 --> 37:36.000
( door opens)

38:16.545 --> 38:18.661
White Lightning.

38:18.839 --> 38:21.205
Easiest thing to make with the least
amount of supplies.

38:21.383 --> 38:23.339
I'd start slow
if I was you.

38:23.510 --> 38:26.172
Your stomach's probably
emptier than you think.

38:27.389 --> 38:29.550
Mmm.

38:29.725 --> 38:31.716
I ain't been lit
at dawn since

38:31.894 --> 38:34.306
before everything
fell apart.

38:34.480 --> 38:37.187
Fell apart.
I never looked at it like that.

38:37.357 --> 38:40.690
Seems to me like things
are finally starting to fall together.

38:42.446 --> 38:44.937
At least for guys
like us.

38:45.115 --> 38:47.527
Living like this,
surviving.

38:47.701 --> 38:49.407
We've been doing this
from the start, right?

38:49.578 --> 38:54.117
Getting closer.

39:03.300 --> 39:06.087
You seen this before?

39:06.261 --> 39:07.762
Oh, yeah.

39:07.930 --> 39:10.342
I'll tell you what it is.
It's a lie.

39:10.516 --> 39:13.428
Ain't no sanctuary
for all.

39:13.602 --> 39:17.140
Ain't gonna welcome
guys like you and me with open arms.

39:19.358 --> 39:20.768
Daryl:
So is that where we're headed?

39:20.943 --> 39:23.776
- So now you're asking?
- That's right.

39:23.946 --> 39:27.609
We were in a house
minding our own business

39:27.783 --> 39:30.570
and this walking
piece of fecal matter

39:30.744 --> 39:32.700
was hiding in the home.

39:32.871 --> 39:36.284
Strangled our colleague Lou
and left him to turn.

39:36.458 --> 39:38.949
Lou came at all of us.

39:40.796 --> 39:42.457
He lit out.

39:42.631 --> 39:44.462
We tracked him
to these tracks,

39:44.633 --> 39:48.125
one of those signs, and thus we've
got a destination in mind.

39:48.303 --> 39:51.010
- You see his face?
- Only Tony.

39:51.181 --> 39:52.421
That's enough
for a reckoning.

39:56.979 --> 39:58.469
Claimed.

40:16.665 --> 40:18.701
(music playing )

40:24.506 --> 40:26.371
J‘ Be not so nervous J‘

40:26.550 --> 40:28.882
J‘ Be not so frail J‘

40:30.554 --> 40:35.014
J‘ Someone watches you,
you will not fail J‘

40:36.685 --> 40:39.848
J‘ Be not so nervous,
be not so frail J‘

40:42.524 --> 40:46.312
J‘ Be not so nervous,
be not so frail J‘

40:48.614 --> 40:52.232
J‘ Be not so sorry
for what you've done J‘

40:54.661 --> 40:58.245
J‘ You must forget them now,
it's done J‘

41:00.667 --> 41:02.407
J‘ When you wake up J‘

41:02.586 --> 41:06.454
J‘ You'll find
that you can run J‘

41:06.632 --> 41:09.715
J‘ Be not so sorry
for what you've done J‘

41:12.596 --> 41:15.679
J‘ Be not so sorry
for what you've done J‘

41:21.563 --> 41:23.394
J‘ Be not so fearful J‘

41:23.565 --> 41:25.897
J‘ Be not so pale J‘

41:27.778 --> 41:29.393
J‘ Someone watches you J‘

41:29.571 --> 41:33.280
J‘ You will not leave
the rails J‘

41:33.450 --> 41:36.658
J‘ Be not so fearful,
be not so pale J‘

41:39.748 --> 41:42.706
J‘ Be not so fearful,
be not so pale J‘

41:45.587 --> 41:49.296
J‘ Be not so sorry
for what you've done J‘

41:51.593 --> 41:55.211
J‘ You must forget them now,
it's done J‘

41:57.641 --> 41:59.427
J‘ And when you wake up J‘

41:59.601 --> 42:03.264
J‘ You'll find
that you can run J‘

42:03.438 --> 42:06.726
J‘ Be not so sorry
for what you've done J‘

42:09.444 --> 42:12.607
J‘ Be not so sorry
for what you've done... J‘

42:15.158 --> 42:18.025
Hi. I'm Mary.

42:19.579 --> 42:21.831
Looks like you've been
on the road a while.

42:21.998 --> 42:23.613
We have.

42:23.792 --> 42:27.080
Let's get you settled
and we'll make you a plate.

42:27.254 --> 42:29.245
Welcome to Terminus.

42:33.009 --> 42:35.466
