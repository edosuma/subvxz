00:07.341 --> 00:09.844
Unfortunately, Mr. Sang
cannot be with us today.

00:09.844 --> 00:12.471
He was taken by the devil.

00:12.471 --> 00:14.932
Have you ever
heard of Viktor Kulzer?

00:14.932 --> 00:16.225
Hilltech Industries?

00:16.225 --> 00:18.227
He signed the same
contract as Sang,

00:18.227 --> 00:20.771
and he was found decapitated
two weeks later.

00:20.771 --> 00:24.066
That's your personnel file. I
came by it in the records room.

00:24.066 --> 00:25.985
- We have a records room?
- Of course.

00:25.985 --> 00:29.280
Every company I ever consulted
at has a records room.

00:30.990 --> 00:33.909
- Where do they go?
- They just fall to the bottom.

00:33.909 --> 00:37.997
What do you want to find
when you stop falling?

00:37.997 --> 00:40.207
He wants to make it!
In two years,

00:40.207 --> 00:42.668
Sang never took a single
pitch I gave him.

00:42.668 --> 00:45.713
- And then Patoff shows up...
- He killed Mama Sang!

00:45.713 --> 00:46.714
Wait, what?

01:06.233 --> 01:07.860
God!

01:07.860 --> 01:10.279
It... it was the parrot
this time!

01:13.282 --> 01:14.533
He loves it.

01:14.533 --> 01:15.910
According to the flight
manifest,

01:15.910 --> 01:18.204
Mama Sang flew back
to Seoul that night.

01:18.204 --> 01:20.748
I'm sure he just filled
a suitcase filled with money

01:20.748 --> 01:22.666
and sent her on
the first flight home.

01:22.666 --> 01:24.668
- That's what I woulda done.
- Where?

01:24.668 --> 01:25.836
In your fantasy world

01:25.836 --> 01:27.546
where you're suddenly
running the company?

01:27.546 --> 01:29.965
Hey. Show some respect.
I'm a creator now.

01:31.342 --> 01:33.803
Look at him.
He can't get enough of it.

01:33.803 --> 01:37.097
Well, your new biggest fan fired
23 people in the first week,

01:37.097 --> 01:39.099
15 more people quit in protest.

01:39.099 --> 01:42.895
Yikes. Well, who did we really
lose? You know?

01:42.895 --> 01:46.315
Ginger Pete, and Skinny Lips in
art, I'm gonna miss them a lot,

01:46.315 --> 01:49.318
but the rest of 'em,
I didn't even really know 'em.

01:49.318 --> 01:50.486
See you Monday.

01:50.486 --> 01:52.488
Not if I find
something better.

01:52.488 --> 01:54.907
Well, today
you're mopping floors,

01:54.907 --> 01:56.909
next week,
you're on fries.

02:02.456 --> 02:04.917
- Goodnight, Mr. Patoff.
- Craig?

02:07.336 --> 02:09.046
- You're leaving?
- Oh, it's Friday,

02:09.046 --> 02:11.757
so everybody's just about to
head out for the weekend.

02:11.757 --> 02:13.133
- You have arrangements?
- Nothing special.

02:13.133 --> 02:15.719
My fiancée's got a work thing,
so I was just gonna go

02:15.719 --> 02:17.471
down the road and grab a beer,

02:17.471 --> 02:20.724
- kill an hour or two.
- A beer?

02:28.232 --> 02:30.317
Do you want to come?

02:30.317 --> 02:32.236
I'll need ten minutes
to prepare.

03:29.126 --> 03:30.961
I thought you left already.

03:30.961 --> 03:33.255
He invited himself
to Chimpers with me.

03:33.255 --> 03:35.591
Friday night drinks
with the boss?

03:35.591 --> 03:38.010
Do you know what you're getting
yourself into?

03:38.010 --> 03:41.722
I'm just playing nice
while he makes my game.

03:43.140 --> 03:46.602
- Will you come with us?
- I can't. I've got a date.

03:46.602 --> 03:48.187
- No, you don't.
- Yes, I do.

03:48.187 --> 03:50.356
He's picking me up
after he finishes work.

03:50.356 --> 03:53.233
What? Who is he?
What does he do?

03:53.233 --> 03:55.945
- What are you, my dad?
- I'm ready.

03:57.863 --> 03:59.281
Craig?

04:01.492 --> 04:04.995
Ah, it's just one drink.
Have a good date.

04:12.753 --> 04:15.381
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

04:31.814 --> 04:34.817
So, how are you enjoying
the gaming industry, Mr. Patoff?

04:37.486 --> 04:39.029
How many of these patrons

04:39.029 --> 04:42.157
do you think we could
realistically fight?

04:42.157 --> 04:44.243
Excuse me?

04:44.243 --> 04:47.579
In a brawl.
Five?

04:47.579 --> 04:50.749
- Um...
- Six?

04:50.749 --> 04:52.167
I don't know.

04:52.167 --> 04:55.587
I've only been in one bar fight,
and that didn't go my way.

04:55.587 --> 04:59.174
One on one, or were you
outnumbered?

04:59.174 --> 05:02.553
It was actually just two hits.
Him hitting me, and then me...

05:02.553 --> 05:04.054
...hitting the floor.

05:04.054 --> 05:06.056
He hurt you?

05:06.056 --> 05:08.726
It was pretty bad, actually.
My jaw was all...

05:08.726 --> 05:10.936
They had to get it
all wired up.

05:13.856 --> 05:16.817
May I inquire as to
the reason of this fight?

05:18.402 --> 05:21.488
I was young and I thought
that I was invincible.

05:21.488 --> 05:24.491
Until the bigger guy
took a moment out of his day

05:24.491 --> 05:26.243
to remind me that I'm not.

05:31.248 --> 05:36.128
I think I could fight
four of them.

05:36.128 --> 05:38.088
And with the element
of surprise,

05:38.088 --> 05:40.090
you could subdue
the remaining three.

05:41.508 --> 05:43.510
But this is just
guy talk, right?

05:43.510 --> 05:46.346
We're not actually thinking of
getting into a bar fight?

05:53.812 --> 05:55.814
- Forgive me, Craig.
- I thought...

05:55.814 --> 05:57.733
Mental puzzles.

05:57.733 --> 05:59.902
I'm always running
scenarios in my head.

05:59.902 --> 06:01.153
All right.

06:01.153 --> 06:03.697
Well, maybe you should drink
more of your beer

06:03.697 --> 06:06.158
slow that hamster wheel
down a little bit, right?

06:06.158 --> 06:08.994
Yes, let's enjoy our beers.

06:13.290 --> 06:15.667
You mentioned
a relationship earlier.

06:15.667 --> 06:18.712
Yeah, Patti, my fiancée.

06:18.712 --> 06:21.131
We're actually gonna make it
official in September.

06:21.131 --> 06:24.259
We're going to have a wedding
with about 100, 150 guests.

06:24.259 --> 06:27.304
How about you, you have any--
you have a family, or...

06:27.304 --> 06:29.181
Church wedding?

06:29.181 --> 06:31.433
Yeah, that's kind of
an issue right now,

06:31.433 --> 06:33.685
'cause Patti's Catholic
and I'm not.

06:33.685 --> 06:36.105
I'm really more, Church of
Nintendo, you know?

06:36.105 --> 06:39.650
But in order to be at one of
the venues of her choice,

06:39.650 --> 06:41.568
I'm gonna have to convert
to Catholicism,

06:41.568 --> 06:43.737
which is a whole procedure,
and, you know.

06:43.737 --> 06:47.199
You... you would consider this,
for the Catholic?

06:47.199 --> 06:48.617
For Patti? Yeah.

06:48.617 --> 06:51.078
I mean, it's just a couple
months of brainwashing.

06:51.078 --> 06:53.247
I think it'll be fine.

06:53.247 --> 06:55.082
Now it gets interesting.

07:03.465 --> 07:06.176
You know what?
I actually...

07:06.176 --> 07:09.847
- I have to go.
- It's over already, our beer?

07:09.847 --> 07:13.892
Yeah, Patti, she... she...
I don't know if she has the keys

07:13.892 --> 07:16.603
and I'm worried about leaving
her alone in this neighborhood.

07:16.603 --> 07:19.940
The woman who insists you adopt
a faith you don't believe in

07:19.940 --> 07:23.819
also expects you to open
the door for her?

07:23.819 --> 07:26.530
It's better than getting
in a bar fight.

07:28.740 --> 07:32.619
I knew we would have
good banter, Craig.

07:32.619 --> 07:35.706
Now, let's finish these and move
on to the next place.

07:35.706 --> 07:38.792
The next place? I actually have
so much work this weekend,

07:38.792 --> 07:40.836
I think I better
be heading out.

07:40.836 --> 07:44.089
You were generous enough
to bring me here for a drink.

07:44.089 --> 07:46.717
Now let me take you
somewhere in return.

08:47.319 --> 08:49.238
We're not going far.

09:10.467 --> 09:12.010
Ten, please.

09:15.013 --> 09:16.473
Top floor?

09:16.473 --> 09:19.977
You're not afraid of heights,
are you, Craig?

09:21.395 --> 09:22.980
Not me, boss.

09:31.238 --> 09:33.073
Welcome, gentlemen.

09:35.158 --> 09:37.411
Your guest...

09:37.411 --> 09:39.079
Of course.

09:42.666 --> 09:45.335
Down to your underpants.

09:45.335 --> 09:47.754
- What?
- Ah, it's my fault.

09:47.754 --> 09:50.215
I should have explained,
there is a dress code.

09:56.513 --> 09:59.725
Unless you feel that the rules
were not made for you.

09:59.725 --> 10:01.143
Craig.

10:25.709 --> 10:28.211
There is someone
I want to say hello to.

10:28.211 --> 10:30.213
Order us some drinks
at the bar.

10:48.148 --> 10:50.067
Hey, what do you got
on tap?

10:50.067 --> 10:51.485
Pick a color.

10:54.446 --> 10:56.073
Give me two blues.

11:15.258 --> 11:18.595
Thanks. I think we're probably
going to want to start a tab.

11:45.622 --> 11:48.041
You don't belong here,
do you?

11:49.626 --> 11:51.837
Is it that obvious?

11:51.837 --> 11:55.715
I came here with my boss, I
think he must be a member here.

11:55.715 --> 11:57.217
What did you do?

11:58.802 --> 12:01.930
What do I do?
Um, I write code for, uh...

12:01.930 --> 12:05.350
No, I, uh, create
and produce video games.

12:07.352 --> 12:09.354
Milani.

12:10.730 --> 12:12.607
This is
my dear friend, Craig.

12:12.607 --> 12:14.818
Hey, Milani.
I'm Craig.

12:17.487 --> 12:19.698
He's engaged
to be married.

12:19.698 --> 12:23.160
He's abandoning
his beliefs for her.

12:23.160 --> 12:26.163
To be fair, I never really
had any to begin with.

12:26.163 --> 12:28.373
Where did you
meet her, Craig?

12:28.373 --> 12:31.877
At work? Most relationships
start at work, don't they?

12:33.295 --> 12:35.547
Ah. It's actually not
a great story.

12:35.547 --> 12:38.925
I was getting something removed
and she was the attending nurse.

12:38.925 --> 12:41.303
What did
she take off?

12:41.303 --> 12:42.679
A benign, fatty lump.

12:42.679 --> 12:44.306
It was behind
my left shoulder.

12:44.306 --> 12:46.766
It was about the size
of a golf ball.

12:46.766 --> 12:48.351
How romantic.

12:48.351 --> 12:51.813
Carry a little piece of the one
you love, everywhere you go.

12:54.691 --> 12:56.860
I don't know that
she kept it, but...

13:00.071 --> 13:02.908
Um, I'm gonna go
to the bathroom.

13:02.908 --> 13:06.244
I'll let you two
catch up.

13:06.244 --> 13:09.289
Uh, three more
on your return.

13:11.374 --> 13:12.834
Sounds good.

13:26.598 --> 13:29.142
- Hey. How was it?
- Artificial limbs in Moscow.

13:29.142 --> 13:31.311
What was that company
you were talking about?

13:31.311 --> 13:33.772
Hilltech. Patoff had
a contract with their CEO,

13:33.772 --> 13:35.649
Right before Sang
signed his deal.

13:35.649 --> 13:37.567
Yeah, well,
I think he may have shipped

13:37.567 --> 13:39.277
some of their merchandise
over with him.

13:39.277 --> 13:42.405
There's this woman here, um...
Melanie or Malorie...

13:42.405 --> 13:45.492
Fuck! I can't remember what her
name was, but I'm gonna ask her.

13:45.492 --> 13:47.410
Wait, wait, slow down.
Where are you?

13:47.410 --> 13:50.872
I don't know. I'm...

13:50.872 --> 13:53.792
It's very blue here,
and beautiful.

13:53.792 --> 13:56.002
I mean, everyone here is
so beautiful, like,

13:56.002 --> 13:57.921
nines and above.
And the coat guy!

13:57.921 --> 13:59.548
- Are you drinking?
- A little bit.

13:59.548 --> 14:02.842
I had one beer and one sip of
blue, okay? Sue me.

14:02.842 --> 14:04.970
Anyway, she knows him,
this Melody... Fuck.

14:04.970 --> 14:07.389
That's not her name either.
What was her fuckin' name?

14:07.389 --> 14:09.140
- What's she like?
- I wanna say,

14:09.140 --> 14:11.768
ventriloquist dummy,
but I probably shouldn't.

14:11.768 --> 14:15.063
I'm gonna flirt with her
and see what I can find out...

14:16.940 --> 14:18.858
Okay, love you too.

14:18.858 --> 14:20.026
Craig, be careful.

14:24.155 --> 14:25.156
Hey.

14:57.814 --> 15:00.483
Did your friend leave?

15:00.483 --> 15:02.402
Perhaps we have to
accept

15:02.402 --> 15:05.405
that we're not the most
attractive men here, Craig.

15:22.297 --> 15:25.342
So, consultancy work must really
pay well if it brings you

15:25.342 --> 15:28.011
into places
like this, huh?

15:28.011 --> 15:29.888
I offer a very
simple service,

15:29.888 --> 15:32.849
and I work towards the
betterment of my client's needs.

15:32.849 --> 15:34.726
For that,
I'm generously compensated.

15:34.726 --> 15:36.561
What... what did Sang need?

15:36.561 --> 15:39.105
Did he need more money,
or more likes?

15:48.114 --> 15:52.327
Unfortunately, I'll have to
leave you for a while, Craig.

15:52.327 --> 15:54.496
I made a promise
to help a friend.

15:54.496 --> 15:57.165
Shouldn't take very long.

15:57.165 --> 16:00.627
Although, if I had assistance...

16:04.297 --> 16:06.174
You want me to come?

16:06.174 --> 16:09.761
I'm enjoying your company
so much, Craig.

16:13.431 --> 16:15.141
Why let it end?

16:37.539 --> 16:38.998
Whoa, whoa, wait.

16:38.998 --> 16:42.669
- My clothes.
- Oh, we're coming back.

16:42.669 --> 16:45.296
Ride up front.
I sent the driver home.

16:55.014 --> 16:57.267
What's this favor
we're doing?

16:57.267 --> 16:58.685
Delivery.

17:04.023 --> 17:05.567
Wait, what?!

17:05.567 --> 17:07.152
What...
What the fucking hell?!

17:07.152 --> 17:09.320
What the fuck is going on?

17:09.320 --> 17:11.322
Who is that?!

17:11.322 --> 17:13.283
- Don't touch!
- Ah!

17:15.577 --> 17:18.288
- Stop the car!
- I can't do that, Craig.

17:18.288 --> 17:19.789
We need to help him!

17:19.789 --> 17:21.541
I don't think that's advisable.

17:27.005 --> 17:28.798
What's happening to me?

17:28.798 --> 17:31.801
You're having
a panic attack, Craig.

17:31.801 --> 17:35.221
Oh, please stop the fucking car.
Stop the car.

17:35.221 --> 17:37.515
That won't help you.

17:37.515 --> 17:41.811
You need to control this,
instead of this controlling you.

17:43.521 --> 17:46.232
Stop the fucking car!
Stop the car!

18:27.357 --> 18:29.359
There you go.

18:29.359 --> 18:32.028
All better?

19:26.833 --> 19:28.501
Would you like
some music?

19:28.501 --> 19:33.047
I haven't yet asked,
what is your taste?

19:33.047 --> 19:36.009
Are you all right
back there?

19:36.009 --> 19:40.263
Oh, I think their mouth will be
taped shut beneath the...

19:40.263 --> 19:43.266
what is it, a bed sheet,
a table cloth?

19:43.266 --> 19:46.561
We need to pull over to check
if he can breathe properly.

19:46.561 --> 19:48.187
He could be choking under there.

19:48.187 --> 19:50.899
But if we remove the sheet,
then he may see

19:50.899 --> 19:54.068
- where we're taking him.
- Where are we taking him?

19:56.195 --> 19:57.530
A boat?!

19:57.530 --> 19:59.741
Mr. Patoff, sir, I'm not
comfortable with anything

19:59.741 --> 20:02.118
that's happening here.
I don't know why you thought

20:02.118 --> 20:04.871
that I'd wanna be involved with
any of this, but I don't.

20:04.871 --> 20:07.790
To be fair, Craig, the fault's
not entirely with me,

20:07.790 --> 20:11.669
but perhaps shared equally
between us.

20:11.669 --> 20:15.006
- Wait, what do you mean?
- When I asked you to help me

20:15.006 --> 20:19.052
on an errand, you didn't declare
your history of panic attacks.

20:19.052 --> 20:21.220
I don't have a history
of panic attacks.

20:26.893 --> 20:29.938
How did he look?

20:29.938 --> 20:31.522
Who?

20:31.522 --> 20:33.733
Was he still warm?

20:33.733 --> 20:35.026
Mr. Sang?

20:36.694 --> 20:38.863
Well, I...

20:38.863 --> 20:42.200
I know this must be awkward,
but you have my word.

20:42.200 --> 20:44.452
I won't share anything
you tell me.

20:44.452 --> 20:46.079
One friend to another.

20:47.372 --> 20:49.832
Did you feel him
leave the room?

20:54.671 --> 20:59.092
Mr. Patoff, sir, could we
please stop the car? Please.

20:59.092 --> 21:02.512
Well, I can't do that.
We're on a bridge.

21:09.310 --> 21:12.063
Before I tell you
what I'm about to tell you,

21:12.063 --> 21:15.358
you have to promise me
that you won't panic again.

21:17.986 --> 21:19.404
I'll try.

21:20.989 --> 21:24.951
Our passenger back here
is responsible for the death

21:24.951 --> 21:26.744
of our imperious leader.

21:28.079 --> 21:31.040
The kid!?
You kidnapped the fucking kid?

22:04.032 --> 22:05.533
Okay,

22:05.533 --> 22:08.536
whatever you're thinking of
doing, please don't.

22:08.536 --> 22:10.997
You'll find a knife
in the glove box.

22:12.582 --> 22:15.334
- Look and see.
- I don't want to look in there.

22:15.334 --> 22:16.919
May I remind you

22:16.919 --> 22:19.714
that we work for the betterment
of Mr. Sang's interests.

22:19.714 --> 22:21.382
Sang? Sang is dead.

22:21.382 --> 22:23.968
Then revenge would surely
be in his interest. No?

22:23.968 --> 22:25.887
He didn't know
what he was doing.

22:25.887 --> 22:27.513
You can't hold a child
responsible

22:27.513 --> 22:28.598
for something like that.

22:28.598 --> 22:31.517
Who, then?
Who do we blame, Craig?

22:31.517 --> 22:35.396
His parents. or schools, or
the bullies, or social pressure,

22:35.396 --> 22:37.732
or refined sugar,
or vapor trails, or...

22:41.110 --> 22:43.905
...us.

22:43.905 --> 22:47.992
We are responsible
for the death of Mr. Sang?

22:47.992 --> 22:52.371
I mean, we didn't pull
the trigger, but, yeah,

22:52.371 --> 22:54.332
we sort of handed
him the gun.

22:58.211 --> 23:00.463
How long have we been
on this bridge?

23:05.885 --> 23:08.387
You're breathing
too fast, Craig.

23:08.387 --> 23:09.847
Am I?

23:11.682 --> 23:14.560
You need to confront
these fears.

23:14.560 --> 23:16.729
I need to get off
this fucking bridge.

23:16.729 --> 23:20.274
Where's the Craig who stood up
to that brute in the bar fight?

23:20.274 --> 23:24.153
- He broke my fucking jaw!
- But you faced him.

23:24.153 --> 23:28.741
As you will face this.
Now breathe with me.

23:28.741 --> 23:29.951
In...

23:32.370 --> 23:35.039
Out.

23:38.084 --> 23:39.752
In...

23:42.046 --> 23:45.424
We are instructed
to stop for gas.

25:00.458 --> 25:02.376
Hey, it's Elaine.

25:02.376 --> 25:04.253
Leave a message.

25:25.733 --> 25:28.527
This isn't what I wanted.

25:28.527 --> 25:30.905
Whatever happens,
I want you to know that.

25:56.514 --> 25:58.349
Come on... fucker.

26:04.855 --> 26:07.316
Ah. Uh...

26:07.316 --> 26:08.359
What the fuck?

26:12.238 --> 26:14.365
- Where are we?
- Uh...

26:14.365 --> 26:16.701
Where are we?!

26:16.701 --> 26:19.203
We're in, uh, Long Beach.

26:23.749 --> 26:25.459
Frank Florez.

26:25.459 --> 26:29.046
If you want to know what he's
made of, find Frank Florez.

26:46.272 --> 26:49.275
My friend, Milani, has been
struggling with substance abuse

26:49.275 --> 26:52.028
for many years.

26:52.028 --> 26:55.072
I had left her in a
rehabilitation clinic in Moscow

26:55.072 --> 26:57.408
but somehow she found
her way here.

26:58.784 --> 27:03.456
My aim was to send her home,
complete her treatment.

27:03.456 --> 27:06.083
Now, of course I knew she'd put
up resistance,

27:06.083 --> 27:08.878
addicts always do.

27:08.878 --> 27:11.339
But now, as a direct result
of your actions,

27:11.339 --> 27:14.300
Milani is alone
on the streets of Long Beach,

27:14.300 --> 27:15.760
looking for drugs.

27:17.053 --> 27:18.429
You lied to me.

27:19.847 --> 27:24.060
I had to test your loyalty
to Mr. Sang

27:24.060 --> 27:27.480
to know if we truly
can be friends.

27:29.482 --> 27:30.941
And?

27:36.947 --> 27:38.532
Let's just say

27:38.532 --> 27:41.827
I won't be relying on you
in a crisis.

27:59.720 --> 28:01.347
You look nice.

28:03.140 --> 28:05.184
Haven't seen that
on you before.

28:05.184 --> 28:08.938
Oh, uh, it's a loaner.

28:08.938 --> 28:11.315
Hmm. Good night?

28:11.315 --> 28:13.734
Yeah. Just got
a couple beers after work,

28:13.734 --> 28:15.403
I didn't want
to wake you.

28:15.403 --> 28:17.321
You should wear
that on Monday.

28:17.321 --> 28:20.116
- Monday?
- Church.

28:20.116 --> 28:22.410
We're meeting
Father Stollen.

28:22.410 --> 28:25.663
Ah, we'll make a good
Catholic boy out of you yet.

29:56.462 --> 29:58.756
Hey, it's Elaine.

29:58.756 --> 30:01.383
Leave a message.

30:01.383 --> 30:05.846
We work for a sociopath.
Call me.
