WEBVTT

00:07.590 --> 00:08.808
Here.

00:10.010 --> 00:12.113
They used to hide this
in Dad's sock drawer,

00:12.137 --> 00:13.906
and we'd sneak in and look
at it when we were kids.

00:13.930 --> 00:16.649
I remember. You and Bailey
used to charge admission.

00:22.188 --> 00:23.364
Huh?

00:23.440 --> 00:26.993
What? Is that... Only
two people or...

00:27.444 --> 00:29.380
You know, I don't even
think I have one of those.

00:29.404 --> 00:30.788
Don't mind me.

00:31.614 --> 00:34.167
Um, Claud, do you have
to do that right now?

00:34.409 --> 00:37.045
Is it my fault that my tent's
not big enough for a dresser?

00:37.078 --> 00:38.222
I don't think so.

00:38.246 --> 00:39.547
Just get out of here.

00:39.873 --> 00:41.049
Now!

00:49.591 --> 00:50.568
All right.

00:50.592 --> 00:51.694
Oh, I forgot to grab my...

00:51.718 --> 00:53.728
God, Claud, you want me
to break your other arm?

00:54.012 --> 00:57.774
Man, you really should try
some relaxation exercises.

01:01.519 --> 01:02.653
All right.

01:07.650 --> 01:08.794
You didn't hear that?

01:08.818 --> 01:09.795
What?

01:09.819 --> 01:11.964
Owen. I can practically hear him
crying from across the street.

01:11.988 --> 01:13.799
Aren't you the one who's supposed
to be looking after him?

01:13.823 --> 01:15.458
Well, he's been fine
the whole night.

01:15.742 --> 01:17.344
It only takes a
second to go in there

01:17.368 --> 01:18.836
and pat him on the back, Jule.

01:21.164 --> 01:23.132
...Now back to our story.

01:23.625 --> 01:25.936
- Did you leave Owen's blankie here?
- God, Charlie.

01:25.960 --> 01:27.813
You know, this is
getting ridiculous.

01:27.837 --> 01:29.023
This is my room, okay?

01:29.047 --> 01:30.858
My room. Nobody knocks.

01:30.882 --> 01:33.351
Nobody cares what I
might be doing in here.

01:34.052 --> 01:35.978
Come on, Justin.

01:41.726 --> 01:43.402
Shh. Time for a nap.

01:47.065 --> 01:48.282
Hey.

01:48.441 --> 01:49.742
Hey, Claud.

01:51.611 --> 01:53.413
So did you have a good day?

01:53.988 --> 01:55.373
It was all right.

01:55.698 --> 01:57.542
Good, good.

01:58.493 --> 01:59.752
That's good.

02:05.333 --> 02:07.019
There's something I
have to tell you.

02:07.043 --> 02:08.395
Only you're gonna be mad.

02:08.419 --> 02:10.021
And, well, it's really
not my fault, but...

02:10.045 --> 02:11.389
What's not your fault?

02:14.134 --> 02:15.476
Kirsten called.

02:15.552 --> 02:17.113
- What?
- Yeah, but...

02:17.137 --> 02:18.280
She did? You talked to her?

02:18.304 --> 02:19.240
No.

02:19.264 --> 02:21.367
Well, she left a message
on the answering machine.

02:21.391 --> 02:23.035
What did it say?
How'd she sound?

02:23.059 --> 02:24.318
Sort of like...

02:24.435 --> 02:26.831
Hello... Charlie.

02:26.855 --> 02:29.323
- It's Kirsten.
- Claud.

02:29.858 --> 02:31.418
Well, you know how the
machine's always screwed up.

02:31.442 --> 02:33.035
What was the message?

02:33.194 --> 02:34.620
Something about, um...

02:34.696 --> 02:37.248
Really needing to see you, or...

02:37.407 --> 02:39.635
I think she said she'd even
try you at the restaurant.

02:39.659 --> 02:41.554
I think. Oh, well, I guess.

02:41.578 --> 02:43.796
Well, I don't know.

02:44.956 --> 02:46.799
Look, all I know is she called.

02:49.460 --> 02:50.678
All right.

02:58.720 --> 03:00.030
Wait.

03:00.054 --> 03:00.948
What?

03:00.972 --> 03:01.866
Hmm?

03:01.890 --> 03:03.482
- What?
- Oh, nothing.

03:04.017 --> 03:05.234
Julia?

03:05.268 --> 03:06.453
Julia?

03:06.477 --> 03:07.705
- Bailey?
- Justin?

03:07.729 --> 03:08.905
Sarah?

Hi.

03:55.235 --> 03:58.130
Wow. God, it's... It's really...

03:58.154 --> 03:59.256
It's great to see you.

03:59.280 --> 04:02.583
Oh, I was gonna
say "a surprise."

04:03.618 --> 04:04.803
What are you...?

04:04.827 --> 04:06.222
Well, I got your message.

04:06.246 --> 04:08.839
Um, well, part of it, anyway.

04:09.457 --> 04:11.467
About you needing to see me.

04:11.918 --> 04:13.103
Right.

04:13.127 --> 04:15.638
I mean, I did. I mean, I do.

04:15.922 --> 04:17.765
So, here I am.

04:18.716 --> 04:19.934
Here you are.

04:23.179 --> 04:25.824
Um, I'm sorry. You kind
of caught me off-guard.

04:25.848 --> 04:28.401
I wasn't expecting to
run into you like this.

04:28.768 --> 04:30.454
Hey, don't be nervous.

04:30.478 --> 04:33.739
I... I think I know
why you called.

04:34.732 --> 04:35.751
You do?

04:35.775 --> 04:38.035
Yeah, and it's okay.

04:38.903 --> 04:40.246
It is? Really?

04:41.030 --> 04:42.248
Really.

04:42.448 --> 04:44.125
Oh, God, I'm so relieved.

04:45.076 --> 04:46.512
I mean, I didn't know how
you were gonna react

04:46.536 --> 04:50.172
in light of... You know,
how things ended.

04:50.707 --> 04:52.133
Are you kidding me?

04:52.250 --> 04:54.478
In fact, I came really
close to calling you,

04:54.502 --> 04:57.356
but then I figured, you know...

04:57.380 --> 04:58.723
It was your move.

04:58.840 --> 05:00.099
Right.

05:00.633 --> 05:02.977
After all, I am the one
who owes the back taxes.

05:05.722 --> 05:06.897
Taxes?

05:08.266 --> 05:10.035
I honestly wasn't
trying to cheat.

05:10.059 --> 05:13.747
I mean, I can barely think of you
as an employer in the first place,

05:13.771 --> 05:15.499
so when it came time
to file the income,

05:15.523 --> 05:16.699
I just...

05:17.442 --> 05:18.659
I spaced.

05:19.193 --> 05:20.411
The income.

05:20.486 --> 05:23.090
Oh. Uh, your nanny income.

05:23.114 --> 05:24.216
Look...

05:24.240 --> 05:26.427
I know going to the IRS together

05:26.451 --> 05:27.886
isn't gonna be a
barrel of laughs

05:27.910 --> 05:29.378
for either one of us right now.

05:31.831 --> 05:33.007
I know it sucks.

05:33.499 --> 05:34.884
No. It's, uh...

05:34.917 --> 05:37.178
It's... It's fine.

05:37.420 --> 05:38.637
Really.

05:38.671 --> 05:40.181
Whatever I can do to help.

05:41.257 --> 05:42.683
Great.

05:47.805 --> 05:50.617
<i>Savannah, you really
must stop calling me.</i>

05:50.641 --> 05:52.318
Oh, gross.

05:52.518 --> 05:53.861
Gag me.

05:54.854 --> 05:57.207
I mean, yesterday,
she gets Dirk.

05:57.231 --> 05:58.792
Last Wednesday, it
was Michael-Dean.

05:58.816 --> 06:00.502
Watch tomorrow,
it'll be Antonio.

06:00.526 --> 06:01.712
I swear, Savannah has affairs

06:01.736 --> 06:03.537
with everybody at
Milford General.

06:04.155 --> 06:06.884
<i>Dear diary, I did something...</i>

06:06.908 --> 06:09.636
I bet your arm is, like, all green
and hairy under that thing.

06:09.660 --> 06:10.836
You think?

06:11.287 --> 06:13.089
Guess I'll find out
this afternoon.

06:14.957 --> 06:16.175
So, um...

06:16.584 --> 06:18.803
I guess you're gonna go
back to dorkestra, huh?

06:18.878 --> 06:21.315
You're gonna start practicing
for, like, three hours a day.

06:21.339 --> 06:23.400
Shh. Crystal's hiding the diary.

06:23.424 --> 06:25.110
- <i>crystal?</i>
<i>- Hello.</i>

06:25.134 --> 06:26.644
How come I've never seen it?

06:27.053 --> 06:28.354
Your fiddle.

06:28.429 --> 06:29.563
I don't know.

06:29.806 --> 06:31.742
Oh, great, now Savannah's gonna
see where she's hiding it.

06:31.766 --> 06:33.150
Oh, she's ridiculous.

06:37.730 --> 06:39.448
You think it'll hurt
when they take it off?

06:43.111 --> 06:44.829
Not once they stop sawing.

06:47.573 --> 06:48.467
Hold on.

06:48.491 --> 06:51.210
Um... So worst-case scenario?

06:53.079 --> 06:55.432
Uh, you sing off-key,

06:55.456 --> 06:56.850
you have zero stage presence,

06:56.874 --> 06:58.143
everybody makes fun of you,

06:58.167 --> 07:00.344
and you can't show your
face in public anymore.

07:00.628 --> 07:01.804
Justin...

07:03.089 --> 07:04.598
You said worst-case.

07:06.884 --> 07:08.769
You know, this would be a
great place for your bed.

07:09.011 --> 07:10.781
Yeah, right. Lots of light.

07:10.805 --> 07:12.857
And I could put my
dresser over there...

07:13.766 --> 07:15.869
Hey. Look at this.

07:15.893 --> 07:17.945
You think I could wear
this for my audition?

07:18.688 --> 07:19.822
Now...

07:20.064 --> 07:22.575
Is this funky, or
is it just old?

07:23.067 --> 07:24.994
- You're gonna rock.
- You think?

07:25.695 --> 07:28.622
You got the voice, plus...
Look at you.

07:29.407 --> 07:30.884
I mean, for a high-school
band, they're okay,

07:30.908 --> 07:32.177
but with you as the lead singer,

07:32.201 --> 07:33.137
every guy in that audience

07:33.161 --> 07:35.755
is gonna be ogling
you like crazy.

07:37.331 --> 07:38.799
Maybe I should rethink this.

07:40.334 --> 07:41.594
Come on, help me.

07:43.588 --> 07:44.805
All right.

07:45.673 --> 07:46.608
No way.

07:46.632 --> 07:49.185
Slide it. Go.

07:54.515 --> 07:56.066
Okay. What do you think?

07:56.225 --> 07:59.028
I want it to say eager,
but not desperate.

07:59.437 --> 08:00.654
What is that?

08:00.980 --> 08:02.865
It's a mouse in the
attic probably.

08:02.940 --> 08:04.992
What kind of questions are
they gonna ask me, you think?

08:05.109 --> 08:07.504
Ooh. Gross, gross!
I hate... Ugh!

08:07.528 --> 08:09.882
Ooh, those tiny, little tails
and those rodenty faces.

08:09.906 --> 08:11.592
I'll protect you. Come on.

08:11.616 --> 08:13.218
I've really gotta nail this job,

08:13.242 --> 08:14.960
'cause money-wise,
right now, forget it.

08:15.077 --> 08:17.264
And colleges would flip out
if I had it on my record.

08:17.288 --> 08:19.475
Don't worry. My dad said he'd
call the station manager.

08:19.499 --> 08:20.976
They used to play golf together.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.395
Do they ever decide to come
down from there, the mice?

08:23.419 --> 08:24.970
Not usually.

08:25.671 --> 08:26.857
God. Interviews.

08:26.881 --> 08:27.900
I always sound like such a geek

08:27.924 --> 08:29.934
- the minute they
start grilling me.

08:30.718 --> 08:33.280
Okay, just say that you've always
been interested in broadcasting

08:33.304 --> 08:34.530
and that you'd love
to learn the ropes

08:34.554 --> 08:36.607
from an entry-level,
hands-on position.

08:36.974 --> 08:38.192
I'm getting out of here.

08:43.813 --> 08:45.533
Well, I was close.

08:46.067 --> 08:47.660
Mouse. Moose.

08:48.152 --> 08:49.578
What are you guys
doing with Stanley?

08:49.862 --> 08:51.590
Uh, he's moving
out of the attic,

08:51.614 --> 08:53.217
and Julia's moving in.

08:53.241 --> 08:54.875
I'm turning it into a bedroom.

08:55.952 --> 08:58.337
Wow. That's...

08:59.539 --> 09:01.475
- Wow, what a smart idea.
- Isn't it?

09:01.499 --> 09:03.884
I don't know why no one
ever thought of it before.

09:04.460 --> 09:05.604
Yeah, it's totally
out of the way.

09:05.628 --> 09:06.730
It's completely private.

09:06.754 --> 09:07.814
And really, really quiet.

09:07.838 --> 09:09.858
I mean, with the door shut, we
couldn't even hear you guys.

09:09.882 --> 09:11.777
I bet if you clear all
that crap out of there,

09:11.801 --> 09:14.154
there'd be tons of room for like a...
A bed, a desk, whatever.

09:14.178 --> 09:16.146
My stuff will fit, no problem.

09:16.722 --> 09:19.984
Only here's the thing. I'm thinking
maybe I should move up there.

09:20.560 --> 09:21.495
What?

09:21.519 --> 09:22.579
I need it more than you do.

09:22.603 --> 09:24.238
I am the one with the roommate.

09:24.605 --> 09:26.124
- Wanna go take a look?
- No way!

09:26.148 --> 09:27.751
Forget it. It's mine.
I called it.

09:27.775 --> 09:30.703
Am I crazy, or did this
happen on <i>The Brady Bunch?</i>

09:30.903 --> 09:32.256
You're right. I like that one.

09:32.280 --> 09:33.715
- With Greg and the groovy beads.
- Yeah!

09:33.739 --> 09:35.801
- Yeah, and Marcia's
making the curtains.

09:35.825 --> 09:37.511
Right, right. And then Cindy
makes that whole speech

09:37.535 --> 09:39.920
- about never getting her own room.
- Yeah.

09:44.667 --> 09:46.135
Both the same length.

09:46.794 --> 09:49.096
What do you know. It
didn't shrink in the wash.

09:49.380 --> 09:50.732
You must be psyched, huh?

09:50.756 --> 09:52.651
Probably ready to play
for a straight week.

09:52.675 --> 09:54.101
Mind if I just perch?

09:54.176 --> 09:56.103
Kind of like to hear the debut.

09:56.637 --> 09:57.573
You know something, Claud?

09:57.597 --> 10:00.409
All these months I kept Tuesday
and Thursday afternoons open.

10:00.433 --> 10:02.869
Danny Moscowitz kept begging
me to switch his lessons.

10:02.893 --> 10:04.663
But I said, "No. Can't do it.

10:04.687 --> 10:06.196
Those are Claudia's times."

10:09.358 --> 10:10.701
Here you go.

10:13.279 --> 10:15.623
So, what am I supposed
to do, just start?

10:15.990 --> 10:17.175
Whatever's comfortable.

10:17.199 --> 10:18.510
You wanna try a few scales,

10:18.534 --> 10:20.252
or warm up with
some easy Mozart?

10:20.620 --> 10:21.847
Your call.

10:21.871 --> 10:23.557
Gonna be back to your
old self in no time.

10:23.581 --> 10:24.798
Guaranteed.

10:26.917 --> 10:28.969
Oh. It feels kind of funny.

10:29.587 --> 10:32.056
Probably because you're not used
to bending your wrist like that.

10:32.757 --> 10:35.434
Just try a few scales.
Take it slow.

10:39.889 --> 10:42.566
Ugh. My fingers are throbbing.

10:42.767 --> 10:44.360
Well, maybe you're
pressing too hard.

10:46.354 --> 10:47.613
Ow.

10:52.443 --> 10:55.287
Ugh. My arm. Ow.

10:55.321 --> 10:57.498
It's got this really weird
pain running through it.

10:57.657 --> 10:58.717
Really? Let me see it.

10:58.741 --> 11:01.627
You can't see it. Well,
it's just there.

11:02.286 --> 11:04.514
Claud, it really shouldn't hurt.
The doctor said...

11:04.538 --> 11:07.383
What does the stupid doctor know?
It's not his arm, it's mine.

11:07.541 --> 11:09.134
And I'm telling you it hurts.

11:10.211 --> 11:11.345
A lot.

11:30.564 --> 11:31.740
Bailey!

11:35.986 --> 11:37.287
What are you doing?

11:37.738 --> 11:38.914
If you wanna help out,

11:38.948 --> 11:40.342
Clash goes on this
end, Wilco over there

11:40.366 --> 11:42.219
and just fill in the rest of
the alphabet along the way.

11:42.243 --> 11:45.671
You just can't do this. You can't just
decide to take this place away from me.

11:46.247 --> 11:48.141
It's not like you're going to
listen to reasonable arguments.

11:48.165 --> 11:50.435
What arguments? I thought of it first.
It was my idea.

11:50.459 --> 11:52.261
Are you back to this dibs stuff?

11:52.461 --> 11:54.064
I'm older, okay? How about that?

11:54.088 --> 11:55.357
I get the attic
because I'm older.

11:55.381 --> 11:57.025
Bailey, come on, I
really need this place.

11:57.049 --> 11:58.235
I mean, when Justin comes over...

11:58.259 --> 12:00.862
Hey, news flash. You're not the
only one going out with somebody.

12:00.886 --> 12:04.449
Yeah, I know, but... Okay, I'm trying
out for this band, the Nielsen Family.

12:04.473 --> 12:05.826
And I'm gonna need
somewhere to practice.

12:05.850 --> 12:07.285
Yeah, so? You could
sing in the shower.

12:07.309 --> 12:08.245
God!

12:08.269 --> 12:11.248
Look, I'm like two seconds away
from getting this TV internship.

12:11.272 --> 12:12.791
Coming home late. What
am I supposed to do?

12:12.815 --> 12:13.792
Wake Owen up every night?

12:13.816 --> 12:14.835
You can have my room.

12:14.859 --> 12:17.379
Oh, right. So it's not good enough for
you, but it's good enough for me?

12:17.403 --> 12:19.339
Bailey, I need the
privacy, okay?

12:19.363 --> 12:21.299
Doors mean nothing to
anybody in this family.

12:21.323 --> 12:23.459
Hey, you know what? I
don't even have a door.

12:23.492 --> 12:27.305
Okay, I live with a 2-year-old. I'm 17.
I deserve my own room.

12:27.329 --> 12:29.516
God, I'm so sick
of you sometimes!

12:29.540 --> 12:32.801
I'm so sick of everybody being
in my face all the time.

12:32.835 --> 12:34.729
"Take care of Owen and
take care of the house.

12:34.753 --> 12:35.981
And help me with my homework.

12:36.005 --> 12:37.649
And can I come in?
And can we talk?"

12:37.673 --> 12:39.943
I just need somewhere to
get away from all of you.

12:39.967 --> 12:42.853
Yeah, well, same here.
Now get out of my room.

12:45.264 --> 12:46.482
Beat it.

12:54.190 --> 12:55.167
What the hell are you doing?

12:55.191 --> 12:57.159
I'm just helping
you straighten up.

13:03.908 --> 13:06.803
Hundreds of people cheat on their
taxes on purpose every year

13:06.827 --> 13:08.013
and never get nailed.

13:08.037 --> 13:09.379
I screw up once...

13:09.663 --> 13:11.340
I could fix this
for you, you know.

13:11.457 --> 13:12.767
Doesn't bother me.

13:12.791 --> 13:15.677
Ah. Here it is. November 30th.

13:16.295 --> 13:17.971
I can't believe that
doesn't drive you nuts.

13:18.005 --> 13:19.149
It did.

13:19.173 --> 13:20.516
Now it's charming.

13:22.259 --> 13:24.112
Okay, so I have

13:24.136 --> 13:25.989
four other deposits that match...

13:26.013 --> 13:27.856
What are you gonna
do with these?

13:29.016 --> 13:31.276
What, you don't like that look?

13:32.311 --> 13:35.072
Well, you could do
with some bookshelves,

13:36.065 --> 13:37.834
I mean, if you're staying here.

13:37.858 --> 13:39.701
Not really worth
doing if you're not.

13:39.902 --> 13:42.329
No, guess not.

13:43.364 --> 13:44.424
But from the looks of the place,

13:44.448 --> 13:46.917
you're really... Settling in.

13:47.826 --> 13:48.762
It's a good neighborhood.

13:48.786 --> 13:50.045
And it's cheap.

13:52.289 --> 13:53.465
Yeah.

13:55.209 --> 13:56.844
You've got your
books here and...

13:57.878 --> 13:59.346
Clothes and...

14:00.297 --> 14:01.598
Broken table...

14:03.259 --> 14:04.476
And a bed.

14:05.469 --> 14:07.437
Ah, it's a big bed.

14:10.140 --> 14:11.942
It's not that big.
It's just a queen.

14:14.019 --> 14:15.320
Huh.

14:16.063 --> 14:17.447
Looks big.

14:20.401 --> 14:21.577
Feels big.

14:32.788 --> 14:34.015
Forty-two bucks.

14:34.039 --> 14:36.810
I can't believe those idiots wasted
my time and my taxpayer's money

14:36.834 --> 14:38.520
chasing me down for 42 bucks.

14:38.544 --> 14:39.771
You'd be happy if it were more?

14:39.795 --> 14:41.648
Yes. Well...

14:41.672 --> 14:42.566
Okay, no.

14:42.590 --> 14:44.474
But at least I'd be mad
for the right reasons.

14:45.467 --> 14:46.361
Listen, Charlie.

14:46.385 --> 14:48.270
Thanks for helping me out.

14:48.470 --> 14:50.314
Hey, no problem.

14:51.223 --> 14:54.401
I like to maintain good relationships
with all my former employees.

14:56.186 --> 14:57.571
So...

14:58.439 --> 15:00.625
Apart from any
unforeseen tax problems,

15:00.649 --> 15:02.201
I guess this is it.

15:03.027 --> 15:05.120
Yeah, I guess so.

15:06.572 --> 15:08.081
- So, uh...
- So, uh...

15:09.366 --> 15:10.709
- Well...
- Well...

15:12.369 --> 15:15.464
Oh, hey. I don't know
how you got here...

15:15.664 --> 15:16.882
I took the bus.

15:17.124 --> 15:18.351
'Cause I could give
you a ride home.

15:18.375 --> 15:20.729
Oh, no, no, it's way
out of your way.

15:20.753 --> 15:23.513
No, it's not. I'm shooting
straight up Gough, anyway,

15:23.839 --> 15:25.098
'cause, uh...

15:25.591 --> 15:27.559
Remember Rocky the bartender?

15:27.927 --> 15:29.154
Sure. Of course.

15:29.178 --> 15:30.488
He opened his own place.

15:30.512 --> 15:32.365
It's a coffeehouse primarily,

15:32.389 --> 15:34.900
but they serve real food too.

15:34.975 --> 15:37.569
Oh. Real food, huh?

15:37.645 --> 15:39.247
Yeah, and, uh...

15:39.271 --> 15:41.323
It's right there,
you know, on Gough.

15:42.024 --> 15:44.294
So I figure I can go there

15:44.318 --> 15:45.702
right after I drop you off.

15:46.320 --> 15:48.038
Or, um...

15:48.948 --> 15:50.582
If... If you're hungry...

15:55.120 --> 15:58.173
The one thing that I specifically
say don't crayon, Owen crayons.

15:58.499 --> 16:00.644
I had to Xerox my resume
twice now, thanks to him.

16:00.668 --> 16:03.011
And let me tell you, 15
cents a page adds up.

16:03.170 --> 16:05.357
Yeah, well, at least you picked
out nicer paper this time.

16:05.381 --> 16:07.683
Yeah, but this happens to my
stuff all the time, Sarah.

16:08.050 --> 16:09.194
You know that...
That picture of us,

16:09.218 --> 16:11.144
the really great one from
the restaurant last summer?

16:11.553 --> 16:13.615
He chewed it up. And
that's not replaceable.

16:13.639 --> 16:15.825
But does Julia care about that?
No, she doesn't.

16:15.849 --> 16:16.743
Because if she did,

16:16.767 --> 16:19.236
I'd be moving into the attic
without any question what so ever.

16:20.020 --> 16:21.498
It's like my life revolves
around a 2-year-old,

16:21.522 --> 16:22.999
but Julia's life
revolves around Julia.

16:23.023 --> 16:25.210
I know, but besides putting a
padlock on the attic door,

16:25.234 --> 16:26.753
I don't know what
else you can do.

16:26.777 --> 16:28.537
- Well...
- I need more change.

16:31.699 --> 16:34.302
<i>♪ Time after... Sometimes ♪</i>

16:34.326 --> 16:36.054
<i>♪ You picture me ♪</i>

16:36.078 --> 16:40.132
<i>♪ I'm walkin' too far ahead ♪</i>

16:40.332 --> 16:43.561
<i>♪ You're callin' to me ♪</i>

16:43.585 --> 16:47.482
<i>♪ I can't hear
What you've said ♪</i>

16:47.506 --> 16:51.027
<i>♪ Then you say Go slow ♪</i>

16:51.051 --> 16:52.686
You have a really great
voice, you know that?

16:55.764 --> 16:58.066
Have you ever thought about
singing professionally?

16:59.101 --> 17:00.745
I kind of think I should
finish high school first.

17:00.769 --> 17:03.030
No, I'm serious.
You're really good.

17:04.314 --> 17:08.952
So, you know this
band Nielsen Family?

17:09.778 --> 17:11.913
I heard they're having
auditions tonight for singers.

17:12.196 --> 17:13.540
It's an open call.

17:13.741 --> 17:16.094
Wait a minute, Bailey.
You don't mean me?

17:16.117 --> 17:17.220
Yeah.

17:17.243 --> 17:19.180
Not on-stage, in front
of all those people?

17:19.204 --> 17:20.765
Hey, didn't we say
we were gonna be

17:20.789 --> 17:24.259
more adventurous this year,
take more risks, hmm?

17:25.544 --> 17:27.105
Anyone can audition?

17:27.128 --> 17:28.347
Mmm-hmm.

17:42.686 --> 17:45.655
I would take a hickey from
that vampire any day.

17:46.148 --> 17:47.657
Is that supposed to be blood?

17:47.816 --> 17:49.669
It looks like ketchup.

17:49.693 --> 17:50.911
Shh!

17:55.115 --> 17:57.250
Hey, look, if you gotta
bail, it's no problem.

17:57.576 --> 17:59.211
I'll tell you how it ends later.

18:00.496 --> 18:02.130
You got a hot date or something?

18:04.500 --> 18:05.759
No.

18:06.043 --> 18:07.594
I can stay.

18:08.128 --> 18:09.230
Cool.

18:09.254 --> 18:13.183
'Cause in the next scene,
we get to see his butt.

18:16.887 --> 18:19.574
So then I go to return it,
and the lady at Tiffany's

18:19.598 --> 18:21.284
says it isn't even theirs.

18:21.308 --> 18:23.828
- They swapped the boxes.
- No.

18:23.852 --> 18:26.289
Isn't that, like, incredibly
tacky or something?

18:26.313 --> 18:27.739
Incredibly.

18:27.773 --> 18:29.741
No. Dill. You'll hate it.

18:29.900 --> 18:31.410
So, what did you do with it?

18:31.652 --> 18:33.662
Okay, this is the funny part.

18:33.987 --> 18:35.789
I just happened to
see it at Nordstrom.

18:35.823 --> 18:36.800
So I go to return it,

18:36.824 --> 18:39.251
and the guy gives me a
credit slip for 25 bucks,

18:39.451 --> 18:41.221
in a store where nothing
costs 25 bucks.

18:41.245 --> 18:42.180
Wait a minute.

18:42.204 --> 18:44.724
Wendy and Steve only
spent 25 bucks on us?

18:44.748 --> 18:48.176
Yeah, well, you can't really
blame them, let's face it.

18:48.335 --> 18:49.803
We were a pretty
lousy investment.

18:53.715 --> 18:55.068
So, what did we get them?

18:55.092 --> 18:57.644
Uh... Candlesticks.

18:58.554 --> 18:59.855
Wrought iron.

18:59.930 --> 19:01.857
- Expensive.
- Expensive.

19:01.974 --> 19:02.992
Those bastards.

19:03.016 --> 19:05.193
You know, I knew they were
never fully supportive of us.

19:05.644 --> 19:07.946
In fact, can't we say this
whole thing is their fault?

19:08.438 --> 19:09.865
Sounds fair to me.

19:10.149 --> 19:11.292
Your salads.

19:11.316 --> 19:12.617
Thanks.

19:14.027 --> 19:15.171
Fresh ground pepper?

19:15.195 --> 19:16.413
Me yes, her no.

19:17.865 --> 19:19.207
What did the Perlmans get us?

19:19.366 --> 19:20.709
A set of steak knives.

19:21.493 --> 19:23.003
Pathetic, huh?

19:23.245 --> 19:24.546
Enjoy.

19:26.957 --> 19:29.217
Wait. Charlie.

19:29.501 --> 19:31.011
There's jicama in this.

19:31.128 --> 19:34.107
Um, I'm sorry. But he's
allergic to jicama.

19:34.131 --> 19:35.650
Would it be okay to
get one without?

19:35.674 --> 19:37.100
Not a problem.

19:40.429 --> 19:41.730
Saved my life.

20:04.286 --> 20:06.254
Figured you had to show
up sooner or later.

20:06.496 --> 20:08.006
I forgot my watch.

20:09.208 --> 20:11.644
- You mad at me?
- Claudia, it's...

20:11.668 --> 20:13.396
We can just forget the
whole thing, if you want.

20:13.420 --> 20:14.939
I mean, you're
probably pretty sick

20:14.963 --> 20:16.191
of putting up with me by now.

20:16.215 --> 20:18.350
Look, Claud, I know
what's going on with you.

20:20.552 --> 20:21.853
No, you don't.

20:22.512 --> 20:23.772
Yeah, I do.

20:24.765 --> 20:26.034
It's okay to be scared.

20:26.058 --> 20:27.984
- Ross...
- No. Let me finish.

20:28.352 --> 20:31.623
Yeah, okay, maybe it's gonna
hurt a little at first,

20:31.647 --> 20:33.625
and it's definitely
gonna be frustrating,

20:33.649 --> 20:36.836
but, if we just give it
time, I promise you...

20:36.860 --> 20:37.962
I promise you.

20:37.986 --> 20:40.163
You're gonna be just as
good as you ever were.

20:40.572 --> 20:42.165
Maybe better, okay?

20:42.699 --> 20:44.042
No.

20:44.159 --> 20:45.178
Claudia...

20:45.202 --> 20:48.171
Look, I'm sorry if
you were worried.

20:48.247 --> 20:52.393
I'm sorry if I wasted your time today
and yesterday and all the other days.

20:52.417 --> 20:53.760
But, uh...

20:54.503 --> 20:55.813
It's not that I'm scared.

20:55.837 --> 20:57.899
And it's not that I'm not
gonna be any good anymore

20:57.923 --> 20:59.817
or it's gonna take too
long or anything,

20:59.841 --> 21:02.310
because I don't care.

21:04.471 --> 21:05.772
Because...

21:10.978 --> 21:12.153
I quit.

21:19.695 --> 21:20.797
Come on, we're gonna be late.

21:20.821 --> 21:23.707
Hey, I'm not the one who
redid my hair 35 times.

21:23.865 --> 21:26.084
-Does it look okay like this?

21:33.333 --> 21:36.896
<i>♪ Imagine something
Of your very own ♪</i>

21:36.920 --> 21:39.691
<i>♪ Something you can
Have and hold ♪</i>

21:39.715 --> 21:41.808
<i>♪ I'd build A road of gold ♪</i>

21:42.342 --> 21:45.562
<i>♪ Just to have Some dreamin' ♪</i>

21:46.471 --> 21:49.158

21:49.182 --> 21:51.443

21:51.935 --> 21:54.622

21:54.646 --> 22:00.336
<i>♪ Dreamin' ♪</i>

22:00.360 --> 22:01.828
<i>♪ Yeah ♪</i>

22:18.545 --> 22:20.680
You don't have to walk me
all the way to the door.

22:21.256 --> 22:24.059
Hey, it's the least I can do.

22:33.393 --> 22:34.537
I had a really good time.

22:34.561 --> 22:35.737
Me too.

22:39.191 --> 22:40.617
So, uh...

22:41.068 --> 22:42.827
So... I guess...

22:44.780 --> 22:46.498
So I guess this is good night.

22:47.449 --> 22:49.876
Yeah. I guess so.

22:50.452 --> 22:52.796
This is usually the
part where I'd...

22:53.997 --> 22:55.632
Either kiss you good night

22:56.208 --> 22:58.385
or kind of back
away like a doofus.

23:00.045 --> 23:03.274
Um... I... Um...

23:03.298 --> 23:05.183
I'm a little rusty at this.

23:07.594 --> 23:11.231
Am I supposed to
let you in or...

23:12.933 --> 23:14.943
Do you want to kiss
me right here?

23:40.752 --> 23:42.178
Kirsten.

23:45.215 --> 23:46.641
You okay?

23:48.385 --> 23:49.853
What's going on?

23:51.388 --> 23:52.730
I'm just...

23:54.558 --> 23:56.109
I'm so angry.

23:58.186 --> 23:59.404
At me?

23:59.855 --> 24:02.157
No. Not at you.

24:02.190 --> 24:03.408
At myself.

24:03.608 --> 24:05.243
For being so stupid.

24:06.236 --> 24:07.871
God, I'm such an idiot.

24:09.406 --> 24:10.748
Kirsten...

24:10.824 --> 24:11.843
I have spent weeks

24:11.867 --> 24:14.377
trying to figure out how
to feel human without you.

24:15.829 --> 24:17.422
You wanna hear
something pathetic?

24:17.998 --> 24:19.632
I actually bought a book on it.

24:22.169 --> 24:23.511
<i>Getting over Him.</i>

24:25.547 --> 24:27.682
I have done everything
it says to do.

24:28.425 --> 24:31.853
I got my own place, I
joined a health club,

24:32.095 --> 24:33.980
I took you off my speed dial,

24:35.765 --> 24:37.192
and then I go and...

24:39.269 --> 24:40.329
I go and...

24:40.353 --> 24:41.613
And what?

24:42.522 --> 24:44.032
I don't know!

24:44.232 --> 24:46.701
I mean, I don't even know
what it is we've done.

24:47.569 --> 24:49.422
I mean... I know, obviously,

24:49.446 --> 24:51.164
but I don't know what it means.

24:53.575 --> 24:55.210
What does it mean, Charlie?

24:57.454 --> 24:58.880
I don't know.

24:59.623 --> 25:00.882
Great.

25:04.044 --> 25:05.845
Well, maybe that's okay.

25:08.465 --> 25:09.775
Hey, look, I...

25:09.799 --> 25:11.267
You're not alone in this.

25:12.260 --> 25:13.487
I swear, I have no idea

25:13.511 --> 25:15.396
what I'm getting
myself into either.

25:17.057 --> 25:19.025
What's it say about
this in here?

25:21.645 --> 25:23.029
It doesn't.

25:25.523 --> 25:27.242
So we're flying blind.

25:32.322 --> 25:33.873
So we'll be careful.

25:34.866 --> 25:36.376
We'll take it slow.

25:36.826 --> 25:38.628
We'll see what happens.

25:42.123 --> 25:45.561
I mean, there is no way
it was a coincidence.

25:45.585 --> 25:46.479
He did this on purpose.

25:46.503 --> 25:47.855
He knew I wanted this, so...

25:47.879 --> 25:50.149
I'm sorry, what year were
we junior counselors

25:50.173 --> 25:51.641
at that day camp?

25:52.217 --> 25:53.935
You're putting that
on the application?

25:54.344 --> 25:55.603
Well...

25:58.598 --> 26:00.076
Don't you think it's
just unforgivable?

26:00.100 --> 26:01.661
- I mean, to go and
tell your girlfriend...

26:01.685 --> 26:03.329
You know, it is possible

26:03.353 --> 26:04.956
that she found out
about the audition

26:04.980 --> 26:06.781
off a poster or something.

26:08.733 --> 26:10.378
Why are you so sure
that Bailey told her?

26:10.402 --> 26:12.203
Oh, come on!

26:13.196 --> 26:14.548
So what?

26:14.572 --> 26:16.124
Do you want me to
have him rubbed out?

26:16.700 --> 26:17.969
'Cause I know people. I do.

26:17.993 --> 26:19.877
Just one phone call and...

26:24.457 --> 26:25.717
Justin...

26:27.127 --> 26:28.803
You don't wanna work here.

26:30.505 --> 26:31.565
I don't?

26:31.589 --> 26:32.932
Uh-uh.

26:33.883 --> 26:35.727
I have a much
better job for you.

26:38.388 --> 26:40.783
I don't know if she's
thought about this at all

26:40.807 --> 26:43.995
or if she's just overreacting
to how long it might take her

26:44.019 --> 26:45.496
to get playing back up to speed.

26:45.520 --> 26:47.748
She can't just quit. I mean,
she's too good to just quit.

26:47.772 --> 26:49.282
What if that's really
what she wants?

26:49.482 --> 26:51.460
She's too young to know
what she really wants.

26:51.484 --> 26:54.630
You don't spend years of your
life working at something,

26:54.654 --> 26:55.840
becoming that good,

26:55.864 --> 26:57.633
and then just throw it all away.

26:57.657 --> 26:59.593
Maybe it's that Jody girl
she's been hanging out with.

26:59.617 --> 27:00.928
Maybe she has something
to do with it.

27:00.952 --> 27:02.420
Maybe she's just had enough.

27:02.704 --> 27:03.764
If she doesn't wanna
play anymore,

27:03.788 --> 27:05.349
isn't that, like, her choice?

27:05.373 --> 27:07.643
- Why is this up for a vote?
- Because she doesn't realize...

27:07.667 --> 27:09.812
For God's sake, why don't
you just leave her alone.

27:09.836 --> 27:12.815
Oh, oh, I get it, everything else
in the world is worth fighting for,

27:12.839 --> 27:13.774
but not this.

27:13.798 --> 27:15.192
Why don't you just
come right out and say

27:15.216 --> 27:17.320
you don't give a damn about
anybody but yourself.

27:17.344 --> 27:20.948
What? Well... Well...

27:20.972 --> 27:24.368
Why don't you just bulldoze
everyone into doing what you want.

27:24.392 --> 27:26.245
To hell with what's fair.
You want her to play,

27:26.269 --> 27:28.404
so obviously, of course,
she should play, right?

27:28.646 --> 27:29.906
Claud?

27:30.565 --> 27:31.834
You wanna come down
here for a second?

27:31.858 --> 27:33.284
I have stuff to do.

27:38.740 --> 27:40.083
You told them.

27:41.242 --> 27:43.086
Well, yeah, of
course I told them.

27:43.286 --> 27:44.263
We're worried about you.

27:44.287 --> 27:45.681
Well, some of us, at any rate.

27:45.705 --> 27:46.599
Oh, will you shut up?

27:46.623 --> 27:48.675
Will you both shut up, please?

27:48.750 --> 27:50.394
Have you thought
about this, Claud?

27:50.418 --> 27:52.980
Does this have anything to do with you
hanging around with that Jody girl?

27:53.004 --> 27:53.898
No.

27:53.922 --> 27:55.316
What would Mom think, Claud?

27:55.340 --> 27:56.849
- Don't you think...
- Oh, nice.

27:57.217 --> 27:59.445
Very nice, Jules. Guilt's
definitely the way to go here.

27:59.469 --> 28:00.853
I'm not trying to...

28:01.262 --> 28:04.482
Look, all I'm saying is
you're making a huge mistake.

28:04.599 --> 28:07.068
What? Like you know
what's best for me?

28:07.685 --> 28:09.246
You know, I don't see any of you

28:09.270 --> 28:11.572
making real grown-up
decisions about your lives.

28:12.148 --> 28:15.368
I mean, you two, you're playing
tug of war over a stupid attic.

28:15.693 --> 28:17.704
Why shouldn't this be my choice?

28:17.904 --> 28:19.580
I mean, I'm almost 13.

28:19.989 --> 28:22.458
And for the first time in
my life, I actually feel...

28:22.826 --> 28:23.928
Sort of normal.

28:23.952 --> 28:26.421
I mean, I do things. I
have a best friend.

28:26.663 --> 28:29.132
And I don't care if you don't like her.
She likes me.

28:30.291 --> 28:32.686
Look, you can ground
me, if you want.

28:32.710 --> 28:33.854
You can zip me up in my tent.

28:33.878 --> 28:35.930
You can say whatever you
wanna say about Jody.

28:36.714 --> 28:39.517
But there's no way you can
make me play the violin again.

28:49.310 --> 28:50.903
We could go to a movie.

28:51.146 --> 28:52.572
We could.

28:53.440 --> 28:54.741
Or a club.

28:55.108 --> 28:56.836
There are some good
clubs around here.

28:56.860 --> 28:58.036
Are there?

28:58.945 --> 29:01.664
Oh, so many people
in clubs, though.

29:02.907 --> 29:04.459
Movie theaters too.

29:06.870 --> 29:08.379
Can't we just stay in?

29:09.831 --> 29:11.799
I was hoping you'd say that.

29:12.333 --> 29:15.020
'Cause what do we need
that's out there, anyway?

29:15.044 --> 29:16.105
Right.

29:16.129 --> 29:18.097
We got food. We got water.

29:18.339 --> 29:20.099
We got...

29:20.550 --> 29:21.569
Company.

29:21.593 --> 29:22.852
Kirsten.

29:24.471 --> 29:25.698
Is that Claudia?

29:25.722 --> 29:27.023
What is she doing here?

29:27.098 --> 29:29.067
She comes by sometimes.
She misses me.

29:30.268 --> 29:31.778
Hide in the bathroom.

29:33.313 --> 29:34.530
Are you home?

29:36.232 --> 29:37.168
Kirsten?

29:37.192 --> 29:38.451
Coming, Claud.

29:39.694 --> 29:41.172
Boy, am I glad you're here.

29:41.196 --> 29:42.965
I was worried you were gonna
be at school or something.

29:42.989 --> 29:44.175
Um, yeah.

29:44.199 --> 29:46.584
Listen, I really
need to talk to you.

29:46.826 --> 29:49.212
I mean, you're the only
sensible person I know.

29:49.454 --> 29:50.806
This might not be the best time.

29:50.830 --> 29:52.183
I mean, don't you think
playing the violin

29:52.207 --> 29:53.267
should be my decision?

29:53.291 --> 29:54.351
I mean, they're all acting like

29:54.375 --> 29:56.094
they know what's best for
me, but when really...

29:56.920 --> 29:59.013
Oh, hey, you're
fixing the, uh...

30:10.308 --> 30:11.609
Oh.

30:12.310 --> 30:13.611
Claud, I...

30:13.812 --> 30:15.113
Someone's here?

30:18.274 --> 30:20.785
Yeah. Someone is.

30:22.278 --> 30:23.830
I'll call next time.

30:26.658 --> 30:28.126
I'm sorry.

30:41.047 --> 30:42.473
Close call.

30:43.967 --> 30:45.027
Is she okay?

30:45.051 --> 30:46.403
She seems really upset.

30:46.427 --> 30:47.530
Yeah.

30:47.554 --> 30:50.690
She's torn up about all
this violin stuff.

30:52.016 --> 30:53.359
I'll deal with it.

30:59.107 --> 31:00.709
I'm just glad, on top
of everything else,

31:00.733 --> 31:02.368
she didn't, you know...

31:04.612 --> 31:06.122
That would've been a mistake.

31:07.323 --> 31:08.875
It's too soon.

31:09.617 --> 31:11.043
Yeah. Exactly.

31:15.373 --> 31:16.892
Are you crazy? It's cute.

31:16.916 --> 31:18.593
Yeah, well, you're biased.

31:19.878 --> 31:21.355
Julia, wanna see
something really gross?

31:21.379 --> 31:22.597
Hmm?

31:26.009 --> 31:28.153
Wow, that was fast.
You've got a gig already?

31:28.177 --> 31:30.906
Yeah. Baptism by fire. The
first show is next week.

31:30.930 --> 31:32.533
But this picture of me, ugh!

31:32.557 --> 31:33.701
I mean, it looks
like those paintings

31:33.725 --> 31:35.401
of the kids with the
really big eyes.

31:36.477 --> 31:37.496
Hey, Justin.

31:37.520 --> 31:40.865
Hey, uh... So?

31:41.357 --> 31:42.742
So...

31:43.109 --> 31:44.785
Yes.

31:45.403 --> 31:46.547
- Yes?
- Yes.

31:46.571 --> 31:47.631
- You got it?
- I got it.

31:47.655 --> 31:48.915
Oh!

31:49.157 --> 31:51.250
Seven-fifty an hour
plus overtime.

31:51.326 --> 31:53.304
Give me two weeks for that first
paycheck, and we'll splurge.

31:53.328 --> 31:55.931
Mmm. That is so fantastic.

31:55.955 --> 31:57.600
- You got a job?
- Hey, congratulations.

31:57.624 --> 31:59.467
Yeah, at Channel 12.

32:00.251 --> 32:01.562
Channel 12?

32:01.586 --> 32:04.305
Yeah. You know, that TV station?

32:06.591 --> 32:07.850
Are you kidding?

32:08.384 --> 32:09.653
Well, it's nothing glamorous,

32:09.677 --> 32:11.363
total "low man on the
totem pole" stuff,

32:11.387 --> 32:12.656
but, you know, it's still cool.

32:12.680 --> 32:15.826
Wow. That is... That is so low.

32:15.850 --> 32:17.443
You knew I wanted that job.

32:17.769 --> 32:19.278
Wait, you applied?

32:19.312 --> 32:20.497
He applied?

32:20.521 --> 32:22.291
I guess Justin was
more qualified.

32:22.315 --> 32:23.626
I can't believe that
you would actually...

32:23.650 --> 32:25.576
What? Follow your example?

32:25.693 --> 32:26.837
Like it was a coincidence

32:26.861 --> 32:28.088
that Sarah tried
out for the band

32:28.112 --> 32:29.465
after I said I was going to.

32:29.489 --> 32:31.383
- What? Bailey...
- God, Julia!

32:31.407 --> 32:32.509
It hurts, doesn't it,

32:32.533 --> 32:34.720
I mean, having someone take
something that's yours?

32:34.744 --> 32:36.837
I mean, I did hurt
you, didn't I?

32:38.039 --> 32:39.308
Good, 'cause I
wanted you to know

32:39.332 --> 32:40.809
how it feels, how I felt.

32:40.833 --> 32:42.895
Hey, that job could've helped
me get into a college.

32:42.919 --> 32:44.730
So what? You think that
makes a difference?

32:44.754 --> 32:47.316
You think that getting into that
band mattered any less to me?

32:47.340 --> 32:49.109
You just take whatever
you want, Bailey!

32:49.133 --> 32:50.527
So, what is this,
an eye for an eye?

32:50.551 --> 32:52.196
I don't know. You tell me.
You started it.

32:52.220 --> 32:54.480
I started it? What
are you, five?

32:54.806 --> 32:55.699
I tell you what, Julia.

32:55.723 --> 32:57.701
Why don't you just go take
the stupid attic, okay?

32:57.725 --> 32:59.870
Lock yourself up there, and
stay the hell out of my life!

32:59.894 --> 33:01.705
Oh, that's a joke, right?

33:01.729 --> 33:03.123
Because I'm not
even in your life.

33:03.147 --> 33:04.625
I am totally irrelevant.

33:04.649 --> 33:07.086
You could care less what I think,
or how I feel, or what I want...

33:07.110 --> 33:08.369
Yeah, you're right.

33:08.653 --> 33:10.413
You're exactly right.
I don't care.

33:10.530 --> 33:12.216
Yeah. Well, who needs you?

33:12.240 --> 33:13.416
Who needs you?

33:16.411 --> 33:17.586
Sarah.

33:20.832 --> 33:22.049
Justin.

33:24.335 --> 33:25.511
Sarah.

33:29.048 --> 33:30.484
Okay, you tell me.

33:30.508 --> 33:32.528
You explain to me how I'm
supposed to get up on-stage

33:32.552 --> 33:34.947
and sing and pretend like
I'm having a great time

33:34.971 --> 33:37.199
when I feel so completely
lousy about this?

33:37.223 --> 33:38.399
I don't...

33:38.558 --> 33:40.577
Why are you turning this
into some big thing?

33:40.601 --> 33:42.121
"You have such a
great voice, Sarah."

33:42.145 --> 33:43.372
I totally meant that.

33:43.396 --> 33:44.456
But that's not why you told me

33:44.480 --> 33:45.833
about the audition, Bailey.

33:45.857 --> 33:47.501
It was spite, plain and simple.

33:47.525 --> 33:49.869
You wanted to get back at
Julia, so you used me.

33:50.111 --> 33:52.381
- I didn't... I didn't use you.
- Yes, you did.

33:52.405 --> 33:54.582
You put me in the middle,
and I don't wanna be there.

33:54.657 --> 33:56.719
Look, I didn't mean for
you to get caught in this

33:56.743 --> 33:57.886
or to get hurt or anything.

33:57.910 --> 33:59.170
You know that.

33:59.328 --> 34:00.963
But you meant to
hurt her, right?

34:01.706 --> 34:03.642
Look, I don't understand what's
going on with you guys, Bailey.

34:03.666 --> 34:05.561
You used to be good friends.
Now it's like all you do is...

34:05.585 --> 34:07.604
Fight. And you do these
crummy things to each other.

34:07.628 --> 34:09.398
And you know what?
You wanna do that?

34:09.422 --> 34:11.567
Go ahead. Just leave
me the hell out of it.

34:11.591 --> 34:13.235
Justin! Justin, wait a second.

34:13.259 --> 34:14.319
Why are we fighting?

34:14.342 --> 34:16.562
I mean, I helped you
get this great job.

34:17.096 --> 34:19.533
The only reason you
told me about it

34:19.556 --> 34:21.909
was to get back at Bailey.
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah!

34:21.934 --> 34:22.953
Don't deny it.

34:22.976 --> 34:24.496
Look, there is no
way you two are

34:24.520 --> 34:25.496
the only ones who applied.

34:25.521 --> 34:27.708
Are you gonna feel bad
about everyone else too?

34:27.732 --> 34:31.085
No. It's just I haven't
known those people

34:31.110 --> 34:33.454
for, like, seven-eighths
of my life.

34:33.737 --> 34:34.672
And you know what else?

34:34.697 --> 34:37.375
This, uh, little war
you guys are having

34:37.574 --> 34:40.378
doesn't exactly bring out
your best qualities.

34:42.455 --> 34:43.630
Julia?

34:50.630 --> 34:51.972
Vivaldi.

34:52.130 --> 34:53.891
<i>Concerto Opus 7.</i>

34:54.509 --> 34:56.310
It's worth at least 40 bucks.

34:56.511 --> 34:57.863
I'll give you 15.

34:57.887 --> 34:59.114
Fifteen?

34:59.138 --> 35:01.784
What? Are you deliberately
trying to insult me,

35:01.808 --> 35:04.693
or do you have something
personal against Vivaldi?

35:04.852 --> 35:07.081
Look,

35:07.105 --> 35:08.489
let's make a deal.

35:09.190 --> 35:10.741
You see these disks here?

35:11.275 --> 35:13.744
They enough to get me Hole,

35:14.153 --> 35:16.205
the Red Hot Chili Peppers,

35:16.948 --> 35:18.374
Foo Fighters...

35:19.200 --> 35:20.552
And basically anything...

35:20.576 --> 35:23.504
By anybody who hasn't been
dead for the past 200 years

35:26.707 --> 35:29.269
What is it they say about
college acceptance letters?

35:29.293 --> 35:30.270
Thick they want you,

35:30.294 --> 35:31.470
thin they don't?

35:31.754 --> 35:33.389
This was in the mail.

35:47.311 --> 35:51.240
"Mr. Salinger, we are pleased to inform
you of your... Early admission."

35:52.441 --> 35:53.784
Oh, my God.

35:54.193 --> 35:55.870
Oh, my God. No way.

35:56.028 --> 35:57.455
This is...

35:57.947 --> 35:59.290
This is...

36:03.911 --> 36:06.380
Return address says
Massachusetts.

36:08.166 --> 36:09.226
Uh, yeah.

36:09.250 --> 36:11.270
It's... Boston. That's...

36:11.294 --> 36:14.690
And I didn't know you were applying...
That far.

36:14.714 --> 36:17.141
I, uh... I didn't tell anybody.

36:17.800 --> 36:20.237
And I'm not going to tell yet.

36:20.261 --> 36:21.896
Sarah or Charlie or anyone.

36:23.931 --> 36:25.191
Okay.

36:37.653 --> 36:38.871
Wow.

36:39.780 --> 36:41.207
Who would've thought?

36:48.664 --> 36:50.090
Is something wrong?

36:50.458 --> 36:51.759
No.

36:53.961 --> 36:55.189
I don't know.

36:55.213 --> 36:57.556
Charlie, have you told
anybody about us?

37:00.885 --> 37:02.228
Not yet.

37:02.261 --> 37:03.488
Have you?

37:03.512 --> 37:04.813
Not yet.

37:05.890 --> 37:07.191
Right.

37:07.725 --> 37:09.109
That feels right.

37:09.143 --> 37:10.204
If people knew that we were...

37:10.228 --> 37:11.362
What?

37:11.604 --> 37:12.821
We were what?

37:14.899 --> 37:16.075
Back together?

37:17.652 --> 37:19.245
Are we back together?

37:19.654 --> 37:21.840
I think... Maybe.

37:21.864 --> 37:23.123
Don't you?

37:25.660 --> 37:26.835
No.

37:28.788 --> 37:31.423
No. We never make plans.

37:31.540 --> 37:33.384
We never leave this apartment.

37:33.584 --> 37:34.686
And everything we talk about,

37:34.710 --> 37:36.262
it's just stuff from before.

37:37.296 --> 37:38.232
What are you saying?

37:38.256 --> 37:39.890
Do you wanna go out more?
Do you...

37:40.049 --> 37:41.235
Do you wanna make more plans.

37:41.259 --> 37:42.977
Do you wanna tell people
that we're together?

37:44.637 --> 37:45.896
Not really.

37:47.098 --> 37:48.274
Do you?

37:53.104 --> 37:55.406
It's like we're just
holding on to each other.

37:56.399 --> 37:57.575
We're just...

37:59.527 --> 38:01.996
We're just lying here
holding on to each other.

38:03.030 --> 38:04.248
So maybe this...

38:05.283 --> 38:07.918
Maybe this was never
about starting again.

38:08.286 --> 38:09.712
Maybe we were just...

38:10.579 --> 38:13.257
Trying to find a way
to end this, you know?

38:14.166 --> 38:16.927
That isn't so angry and
doesn't hurt so much.

38:31.934 --> 38:33.402
I keep thinking...

38:36.188 --> 38:40.159
Keep imagining how things
would've been if we'd met later.

38:42.111 --> 38:43.787
Five or six years later.

38:45.072 --> 38:47.082
With all this other
stuff figured out.

38:48.284 --> 38:51.712
Like I would've been walking
down some street, you know,

38:53.205 --> 38:55.049
Some crowded street, and...

38:56.959 --> 38:58.636
I would've seen you...

39:01.756 --> 39:03.682
And there would've
been something,

39:04.175 --> 39:05.809
I don't know, in your eyes,

39:06.135 --> 39:07.561
something.

39:08.095 --> 39:09.480
And I would've known.

39:11.140 --> 39:12.608
Just known.

39:15.227 --> 39:16.612
I would've said...

39:17.229 --> 39:18.614
"There she is.

39:22.276 --> 39:24.286
There she is. She's the one."

39:28.783 --> 39:31.210
And I would've been too.

40:10.408 --> 40:11.625
What are you doing?

40:12.243 --> 40:13.544
Oh. Hey.

40:15.287 --> 40:17.005
Thought you were going
out with Sarah.

40:17.373 --> 40:19.341
Yeah. We were gonna, but...

40:21.168 --> 40:22.104
Where's Justin?

40:22.128 --> 40:23.512
He's, um...

40:24.296 --> 40:26.348
Well, I told him I was
doing this, so...

40:27.800 --> 40:29.945
Anyways, I think it'll
probably need a face-lift

40:29.969 --> 40:31.613
by the time you're finished
trashing the place,

40:31.637 --> 40:33.981
but I figured it
was fine for now.

40:37.726 --> 40:38.986
You're...

40:39.478 --> 40:40.946
You're doing this for me?

40:44.525 --> 40:47.244
Well, yeah.

40:48.279 --> 40:51.707
I mean, I know we haven't been
getting along great lately.

40:54.577 --> 40:56.295
And I've been thinking
about you a lot.

40:58.330 --> 40:59.516
About you going away.

40:59.540 --> 41:00.892
I mean, you may only be here

41:00.916 --> 41:02.801
for another six months, so...

41:03.127 --> 41:04.470
So what?

41:05.212 --> 41:06.690
All we do is fight all
the time, anyway.

41:06.714 --> 41:10.184
I mean, I thought you'd
be happy about it, Jule.

41:12.052 --> 41:13.854
Like, jumping-up-and-down happy.

41:15.181 --> 41:16.607
Are you kidding me?

41:19.185 --> 41:20.944
I'm gonna miss you.

41:22.813 --> 41:24.490
I'll really miss you, Bay.
