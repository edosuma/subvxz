We have to make

I think we just all know
what's at stake here.

01:05.266 --> 01:06.698
Nothing's at stake here!

01:06.700 --> 01:09.435
Just tell me right now nothing
will affect or friendship.

-Why did he do that?

01:22.850 --> 01:24.616
Lucas, what do you want?

01:28.222 --> 01:30.255
I don't want anything bad
to happen to us,

01:30.257 --> 01:32.691
but I especially don't want
to be responsible

01:32.693 --> 01:34.593
for something bad happening
between the two of you.

01:34.595 --> 01:37.129
-We know that.
-Why do you think we like you?

See? I have different feelings
for each of you

01:45.573 --> 01:48.474
and I don't entirely
understand them.

01:48.476 --> 01:50.109
We don't
understand this either.

01:50.111 --> 01:52.211
That's why the smartest
thing to do would be to make

01:52.213 --> 01:54.379
the right decision right now
and just move on.

01:54.381 --> 01:55.714
Great! How do we do that?

over the other?

That's the Einstein
Academy goose.

03:18.399 --> 03:20.566
Oh, of course,
the Einstein Academy goose.

03:20.568 --> 03:22.334
Why is it on Farkle's desk?

03:22.336 --> 03:23.702
Einstein captured Farkle.

03:23.704 --> 03:25.337
It was their end
of the year prank...

03:25.339 --> 03:26.705
So, since they took
our mascot...

03:26.707 --> 03:29.308
We took theirs
and now we're even.

03:29.310 --> 03:31.310
Farkle's not our mascot.

03:31.312 --> 03:33.178
What would you call him?

03:33.180 --> 03:35.414
Where's Zay?
They got Zay too?

03:35.416 --> 03:37.015
Zay's back in Texas.

03:37.017 --> 03:38.417
He's at Vanessa's spring formal.

03:38.419 --> 03:41.053
Riley and Maya: Ooh!

03:41.055 --> 03:42.921
All right, guys.
Listen up.

03:42.923 --> 03:45.257
It's your last week of school.

03:45.259 --> 03:47.426
This is my last chance
to teach you something.

03:47.428 --> 03:49.328
You have more to teach us?

03:49.330 --> 03:51.163
I have so much more
I wanna teach you.

03:52.266 --> 03:53.565
So much more.

03:54.768 --> 03:57.836
I mean, you guys are gonna
be leaving this place.

03:57.838 --> 04:00.672
What will you be leaving behind?

04:00.674 --> 04:03.041
What is your legacy?

04:03.043 --> 04:05.110
I want to talk about
not just what

04:05.112 --> 04:06.678
what you've gotten
from this place,

04:06.680 --> 04:08.547
but what you've given.

04:08.549 --> 04:10.182
He's right.

04:10.184 --> 04:12.251
We still haven't thought
of our class prank!

04:12.253 --> 04:14.453
I was thinking
we could let all of the air
out of school.

04:14.455 --> 04:18.223
Everybody would just
be like... (choking)

04:18.225 --> 04:20.092
That'd be hi-larious.

04:20.094 --> 04:22.094
I'll tell you
what's hi-larious.

04:22.096 --> 04:23.128
Nobody saved me!

04:23.130 --> 04:24.463
Why did nobody save me?

04:24.465 --> 04:26.465
Farkle, we looked for you
for a whole five minutes,

04:26.467 --> 04:28.767
and then we took the goose.

04:28.769 --> 04:30.235
He's the new you.

04:30.237 --> 04:32.704
Donnie Barnes,
regular goose.

04:32.706 --> 04:34.439
I'd see that movie.

04:35.542 --> 04:37.876
Oh, please. Farkle cannot
be replaced by a goose.

04:37.878 --> 04:39.911
Farkle is unique
and one of a kind.

04:39.913 --> 04:42.614
-Hah!
-(honks)

04:42.616 --> 04:44.383
You don't know me.

04:49.456 --> 04:51.490
You haven't taught me enough.

04:52.826 --> 04:55.427
-Did I teach you to pass
the mashed potatoes?
-Yes.

04:55.429 --> 04:57.629
Well, then there's a test
on that right now.

04:57.631 --> 04:59.498
You passed!

04:59.500 --> 05:00.499
(chuckles)

05:00.501 --> 05:01.900
Funny daddy.

05:03.170 --> 05:04.670
What's bothering you, Riley?

05:04.672 --> 05:05.937
Everything gets harder.

05:05.939 --> 05:08.473
Everything gets harder
and you didn't tell me.

05:08.475 --> 05:10.742
-Were you going to tell me?
-You didn't tell her?

05:10.744 --> 05:12.678
Only every day.
You tell her.

05:12.680 --> 05:15.147
Life gets harder.
Tell her, Auggie.

05:15.149 --> 05:16.648
I'm doing fine.

05:19.186 --> 05:21.019
We're graduating middle school.

05:21.021 --> 05:24.089
We're supposed to be
in the middle of our education.

05:24.091 --> 05:25.524
The only thing
I'm in the middle of

05:25.526 --> 05:27.025
is a big mess
with two of the people

05:27.027 --> 05:28.493
I care most about
in the world.

05:28.495 --> 05:30.095
Why?

05:30.097 --> 05:32.698
Because we're not
talking about it.

05:32.700 --> 05:34.499
Because Maya
and I both like Lucas

05:34.501 --> 05:36.868
and so we know that
one of us is going to get hurt,

05:36.870 --> 05:38.470
so we're all scared to move.

05:38.472 --> 05:40.272
You know what makes me happy?

05:40.274 --> 05:42.007
How could you be happy
about any of this?

05:42.009 --> 05:44.176
Because you're talking
to us about it.

05:44.178 --> 05:46.611
No matter what happens to you,
we always want to be a part

05:46.613 --> 05:48.013
of what happens to you.

05:48.015 --> 05:49.614
You always will be.

05:49.616 --> 05:51.216
Thanks, Riley.

05:51.218 --> 05:53.552
That's the greatest legacy
any parent could have.

05:53.554 --> 05:55.520
Look, you guys are both
going to be fine,

05:55.522 --> 05:57.389
and there is nobody
stronger than Maya.

05:57.391 --> 05:58.557
Nothing can break her.

05:58.559 --> 06:00.292
-I just don't see it.
-(door opens)

06:08.302 --> 06:12.571
Aww, it's a poor baby.

06:12.573 --> 06:16.808
It's a poor, poor baby.
Come here.

06:18.679 --> 06:20.545
Come here. Oh...

06:20.547 --> 06:24.683
Maya, no matter what happens,
it is nobody's fault.

06:24.685 --> 06:26.318
Yes, it is.

06:26.320 --> 06:28.587
Whose fault do you think it is?

06:28.589 --> 06:30.088
Matthews.

06:31.759 --> 06:33.692
Well, of course.

06:33.694 --> 06:35.360
You didn't teach us enough.

06:35.362 --> 06:36.728
And we don't know
how to handle this,

06:36.730 --> 06:39.064
and now we're leaving,
and you're staying behind,

06:39.066 --> 06:40.332
and you didn't teach us enough.

06:40.334 --> 06:41.733
Yeah, Dad.
You're more than a teacher.

06:41.735 --> 06:43.402
You're like a father to me.

06:44.571 --> 06:46.071
Thanks, Riley.

06:46.073 --> 06:48.707
He's the best teacher
you're ever going to have.

06:48.709 --> 06:50.909
And if there's one thing
I know for sure he's taught you,

06:50.911 --> 06:52.677
it's how to express yourselves
to each other

06:52.679 --> 06:55.447
in the best possible way,
and as long as you do that,

06:55.449 --> 06:57.382
there is nothing
to worry about.

06:57.384 --> 07:00.185
"Hi. It's me, Lucas Friar.

07:01.789 --> 07:04.556
"Since no one
knows what to do,
I made a choice."

07:04.558 --> 07:06.958
Okay, I'm a little worried.

07:06.960 --> 07:08.627
"I choose to stop."

07:09.897 --> 07:12.697
Lucas, put the cards away.

07:12.699 --> 07:14.166
Say what you need to say.

07:20.441 --> 07:21.940
You both mean the world to me,

07:21.942 --> 07:24.709
and I would never do anything
to hurt either one of you.

07:26.079 --> 07:28.647
So, I choose to stop.

07:28.649 --> 07:30.615
You won't decide,
so I did,

07:30.617 --> 07:33.084
and I decided
we're just friends.

07:33.086 --> 07:35.420
That's all we are.

07:35.422 --> 07:37.689
I don't want this to be
the end of us.

07:56.743 --> 07:59.010
You came into this place
a bunch of young kids

07:59.012 --> 08:02.280
who didn't know very much,
and know look at ya.

08:02.282 --> 08:05.150
Young men and women ready
for what's next.

08:06.620 --> 08:07.919
Snap out of it!

08:07.921 --> 08:09.020
Get in here!

08:09.022 --> 08:10.822
(squeaks)

08:10.824 --> 08:12.891
What are you doin'?

08:12.892 --> 08:14.959
We value our friendship
too much to look at each other.

08:14.962 --> 08:17.662
Turn your chair around.

08:17.664 --> 08:19.331
Get in your seat.

08:24.438 --> 08:28.440
Now, the most important thing
you can do in life

08:28.442 --> 08:30.709
is give people a reason
to remember you.

08:30.711 --> 08:35.347
The people who do that are
the ones we study in here.

08:35.349 --> 08:38.850
So, your last assignment
from me and for yourselves

08:38.852 --> 08:41.586
is to figure out
what you will give back.

08:42.823 --> 08:44.890
-What?
-I looked at Riley.

08:44.892 --> 08:46.691
I know. I saw.

08:46.693 --> 08:48.960
So, I'm looking at you
to even it up.

08:48.962 --> 08:51.396
Oh. Well, a girl always
wants to be looked at

08:51.398 --> 08:53.164
to be evened up.

08:53.166 --> 08:55.567
We're just friends,
and I love your outfit.

08:55.569 --> 08:56.635
Hey!

08:57.738 --> 08:59.804
Your hair smells nice!

09:02.042 --> 09:04.743
You smelled her hair?

09:06.914 --> 09:10.715
-Lucas!
-I'm dying here!

09:10.717 --> 09:12.417
What are you grateful for?

09:13.754 --> 09:14.986
Who do you want
to remember you?

09:14.988 --> 09:18.423
Do something
about it right now.

09:18.425 --> 09:19.758
Now get outta here.

09:27.935 --> 09:30.235
I'm not ready
to leave this place.

09:36.843 --> 09:39.544
What's going on?

09:39.546 --> 09:41.846
I'm graduating, Ms. Kossal.

09:42.849 --> 09:45.383
And I wanted to say goodbye

09:45.385 --> 09:48.053
and thank you
for believing in me.

09:48.055 --> 09:50.722
I expect great things
from you, Maya.

09:50.724 --> 09:53.391
You've been given
a real gift.

09:53.393 --> 09:56.227
So, grow.

09:56.229 --> 10:00.098
And when you feel something
you know the rest of us feel,

10:00.100 --> 10:02.367
explain it to us.

10:02.369 --> 10:03.835
Paint us a picture.

10:05.138 --> 10:06.538
I'll try.

10:07.808 --> 10:09.841
I'm glad I had the chance
to be your teacher.

10:12.112 --> 10:13.545
Just a quick goodbye,
Mr. Norton.

10:13.547 --> 10:15.880
We both know emotion has
no place in science.

10:15.882 --> 10:17.916
Right, right, my dear boy.

10:17.918 --> 10:22.821
So, from one scientist
to another, see you on Mars.

10:22.823 --> 10:25.924
Mr. Norton, could we just not
be scientists for one second?

10:25.926 --> 10:28.927
Well, let me remove
the protective goggles
of my soul.

10:28.929 --> 10:30.562
Clear outta here!

10:37.104 --> 10:39.004
I'm really gonna miss you, sir.

10:39.006 --> 10:41.306
The feeling's mutual, my boy.

10:41.308 --> 10:43.975
Is it possible feelings are
stronger than science?

10:43.977 --> 10:45.010
(chuckles)

10:45.012 --> 10:47.145
Keep discovering, Farkle.

10:47.147 --> 10:48.647
(cart rolling)

10:48.649 --> 10:51.149
Me?

10:51.151 --> 10:53.485
Yeah. I wanted
to say thank you.

10:53.487 --> 10:54.786
Why?

10:54.788 --> 10:56.688
I left some kind
of impression on you?

10:57.858 --> 10:59.824
Clear outta here.

11:03.730 --> 11:06.965
Mr. Matthews told me
you had to make a real
difficult choice once.

11:06.967 --> 11:08.867
I was at a crossroads.

11:08.869 --> 11:13.705
I was standing on the corner
of Maple Street and Alcatraz.

11:13.707 --> 11:15.840
How do you make
the right decision?

11:18.879 --> 11:22.547
I always try and make sure
this bench here is polished up

11:22.549 --> 11:25.650
and looking nice and inviting
for you to sit in.

11:25.652 --> 11:26.951
You know why I do that?

11:26.953 --> 11:27.919
Why?

11:31.391 --> 11:34.159
Because you kids come and go,

11:34.161 --> 11:37.395
but this bench
stays right here,

11:37.397 --> 11:39.464
and all the problems
of the universe

11:39.466 --> 11:40.865
get decided on it.

11:40.867 --> 11:43.968
I respect a nice place
where good decisions get made.

11:43.970 --> 11:47.172
It's getting a little worn down,

11:47.174 --> 11:50.408
a little old
as time goes by,

11:50.410 --> 11:53.044
but aren't we all?

11:53.046 --> 11:56.047
Thanks for saying goodbye
to me, Lucas.

11:56.049 --> 11:57.716
It means a lot to me.

11:57.718 --> 11:59.651
Make good decisions.

12:11.665 --> 12:13.231
I don't wanna go.

12:13.233 --> 12:16.000
I'm not ready for high school

12:16.002 --> 12:18.002
and I don't wanna go.

12:18.004 --> 12:19.070
Why not?

12:19.072 --> 12:22.207
'Cause we did great here.

12:22.209 --> 12:23.908
This was the time
of our lives!

12:23.910 --> 12:25.910
We were kings, Matthews.

12:27.013 --> 12:28.413
What will I be next year?

12:28.415 --> 12:30.014
-Not kings.
-No.

12:30.016 --> 12:32.016
The opposite of kings.

12:32.018 --> 12:33.752
Freshmen. Worms.

12:33.754 --> 12:35.854
Worse than worms. Freshmen.

12:35.856 --> 12:37.956
You'll do fine, Riley.

12:37.958 --> 12:39.057
You all will.

12:39.059 --> 12:40.592
Also...

12:40.594 --> 12:44.262
and I don't say
this a lot, but...

12:44.264 --> 12:46.030
I like you.

12:46.032 --> 12:47.398
You do?

12:47.400 --> 12:48.967
Yeah.

12:48.969 --> 12:50.702
You said you had
a lot more to teach us.

12:50.704 --> 12:52.570
And I will.

12:52.572 --> 12:54.038
You're my daughter.

12:54.040 --> 12:57.108
What about the rest
of my friends, Dad?

12:57.110 --> 12:59.277
You need to teach
all of us more.

12:59.279 --> 13:00.745
We're a mess.

13:00.747 --> 13:02.213
We shouldn't feel.

13:02.215 --> 13:03.915
We don't know how to feel
and you need to teach us

13:03.917 --> 13:05.183
how to not feel.

13:15.495 --> 13:18.930
-What?
-You got one last lesson
for the road?

13:18.932 --> 13:21.065
Yeah. I do.

13:21.067 --> 13:24.669
Well, I've never said
this before, but...

13:24.671 --> 13:26.871
you have my attention.

13:28.108 --> 13:29.841
Good.

13:29.843 --> 13:31.376
This one's important.

13:33.346 --> 13:37.982
I've gotten to watch
you guys become friends and...

13:37.984 --> 13:39.918
I've gotten to watch you grow.

13:41.988 --> 13:44.856
You guys grew up so fast...

13:46.159 --> 13:48.993
and I've been trying
to teach you to keep
your feelings inside.

13:48.995 --> 13:50.495
And you were right.

13:50.497 --> 13:51.763
Look at us.

13:53.166 --> 13:54.365
I was wrong.

13:55.702 --> 13:57.335
Your teacher was wrong.

14:00.307 --> 14:02.373
I can't keep you
in this place.

14:03.810 --> 14:05.376
You've outgrown it.

14:05.378 --> 14:09.447
You guys are graduating
to whatever comes next.

14:11.451 --> 14:12.517
Do you know why?

14:12.519 --> 14:14.052
No.

14:14.054 --> 14:15.620
You've earned it.

14:16.857 --> 14:18.022
How do we know
when we're ready?

14:19.492 --> 14:21.826
The same way
we know anything.

14:21.828 --> 14:24.195
Let's take one last
test and see.

14:25.232 --> 14:28.066
-(Maya, Riley, and Lucas groan)
-Yay.

14:35.375 --> 14:36.541
Are you even
allowed to do this?

14:36.543 --> 14:38.142
It's the last day of school.

14:38.144 --> 14:39.043
I'm still your teacher.

14:39.045 --> 14:40.411
I can do whatever I want.

14:40.413 --> 14:43.414
Besides, this test
isn't for a grade.

14:43.416 --> 14:45.016
This is the test to find out

14:45.018 --> 14:46.417
what you've
actually learned here.

14:47.854 --> 14:52.056
Question one.
What's the secret to life?

14:52.058 --> 14:53.258
Maya?

14:53.260 --> 14:55.593
People change people.

14:55.595 --> 14:57.161
And for extra credit?

14:57.163 --> 15:00.064
What us does for them.

15:00.066 --> 15:01.432
What does that mean?

15:01.434 --> 15:05.403
How we help those who are
less fortunate than us.

15:05.405 --> 15:07.071
And are you an us or them?

15:07.073 --> 15:09.240
I'm an us.

15:09.242 --> 15:12.577
I'm very blessed.

15:12.579 --> 15:15.046
We all are.

15:15.048 --> 15:18.116
Question two.
Sneak attack.

15:18.118 --> 15:19.083
Riley?

15:19.085 --> 15:20.885
Pearl Harbor.

15:20.887 --> 15:23.054
And for extra credit?

15:23.056 --> 15:26.958
Missy Bradford tried to tear
our friendships apart.

15:26.960 --> 15:30.628
Lucas was new here
and she tried to throw
a sneak attack.

15:32.299 --> 15:34.432
I think that was
the moment we all realized

15:34.434 --> 15:37.001
what we really meant
to each other.

15:38.905 --> 15:40.338
The moment we all came together.

15:42.242 --> 15:43.875
Good.

15:43.877 --> 15:45.777
Farkle?

15:45.779 --> 15:46.978
Canada.

15:46.980 --> 15:49.280
Our greatest allies are
the people right next to us.

15:51.251 --> 15:54.385
-Lucas?
-I think I was the most
changed by these people.

15:54.387 --> 15:56.387
I know that
whatever I'm feeling,

15:56.389 --> 15:59.724
I can just tell my friends
and everything would be okay.

15:59.726 --> 16:01.292
Will it?

16:03.096 --> 16:05.330
I guess we'll see.

16:05.332 --> 16:07.332
I thought we stopped.

16:09.336 --> 16:11.903
I thought we were just friends.

16:13.940 --> 16:15.473
We're not.

16:15.475 --> 16:18.176
We're no good at it.

16:19.145 --> 16:21.245
We can't even look
at each other anymore.

16:23.283 --> 16:25.316
I don't need any note cards

16:25.318 --> 16:27.352
to know that we have
different feelings now.

16:28.989 --> 16:32.190
And that's why
your teacher was wrong.

16:32.192 --> 16:34.859
I can't hold you back
from what you feel.

16:36.596 --> 16:38.696
Congratulations.

16:38.698 --> 16:41.599
You've all passed this test
with flying colors.

16:43.336 --> 16:44.602
What happens now?

16:44.604 --> 16:47.071
Now you graduate, Farkle.

16:48.375 --> 16:51.309
You walk out of here
with everything you've learned

16:51.311 --> 16:54.212
and you live life.

16:54.214 --> 16:56.147
You live it.

16:56.149 --> 16:59.283
You face whatever comes.

16:59.285 --> 17:02.787
This is gonna be the greatest
test of your friendship yet.

17:04.557 --> 17:06.124
Wow.

17:07.327 --> 17:09.260
I made it to high school.

17:11.464 --> 17:14.399
We're gonna need
some good teachers, Matthews.

17:14.401 --> 17:16.300
Yeah.

17:16.302 --> 17:20.204
So, one last thing.

17:20.206 --> 17:22.473
How will the school
remember you?

17:25.145 --> 17:26.944
I have an idea.

17:28.214 --> 17:29.914
What's our prank?

17:32.986 --> 17:34.385
I have an idea.

17:42.729 --> 17:44.896
And that concludes
our tour of the big,

17:44.898 --> 17:46.931
bad John Quincy Adams
Middle School.

17:46.933 --> 17:47.999
Not so scary, right?

17:48.001 --> 17:49.267
You guys are gonna
do great here.

17:49.269 --> 17:51.035
There's one more thing
before you guys go.

17:51.037 --> 17:52.270
We wanted to give
you guys something

17:52.272 --> 17:53.404
from our class to yours.

17:58.011 --> 18:00.711
We think one of the greatest
legacies in life is friendship.

18:00.713 --> 18:03.047
And no matter what happens
in your new school,

18:03.049 --> 18:05.450
Friends should always have
a place where they can sit,

18:05.452 --> 18:07.285
and talk,
and work things out.

18:08.421 --> 18:11.189
Because sometimes,
life swirls you all up

18:11.191 --> 18:14.292
and knots people together
for a reason.

18:14.294 --> 18:16.260
Is that what you were feeling?

18:17.797 --> 18:19.363
What's that?

18:21.534 --> 18:23.701
I think everybody should
leave their mark.

18:24.904 --> 18:26.838
We work very well together.

18:33.146 --> 18:35.313
<i>♪ We got time, got time ♪</i>

18:35.315 --> 18:38.616
Congratulations, baby girl.

18:38.618 --> 18:42.420
You are now the most educated
person in our family.

18:42.422 --> 18:45.490
Mom, you didn't
graduate middle school?

18:45.492 --> 18:48.392
-Here you go.
-Okay, it was a joke.

18:48.394 --> 18:50.261
I am a high school graduate

18:50.263 --> 18:52.430
with three days of college
under my belt.

18:52.432 --> 18:54.432
And if I hadn't
taken neurobiology,

18:54.434 --> 18:55.399
perhaps I'd still be there.

18:55.401 --> 18:57.368
So, take classes
you understand, honey.

19:02.075 --> 19:03.774
Congratulations, Farkle.

19:03.776 --> 19:05.743
Only four more years
till Princeton.

19:05.745 --> 19:07.578
I wanna go
wherever my friends go.

19:07.580 --> 19:09.380
C'mere.

19:10.817 --> 19:12.683
Look at this place.

19:12.685 --> 19:15.486
Different view than
when we were growing up.

19:15.488 --> 19:17.855
Glad you're here
with us, Zay.

19:17.857 --> 19:20.024
So, how was the formal?

19:21.294 --> 19:24.095
Vanessa likes me better now
than when I lived there.

19:24.097 --> 19:26.497
Now she all missin' me
'cause I'm gone.

19:26.499 --> 19:28.799
You know, I got this whole
love thing figured out.

19:28.801 --> 19:30.701
Don't be there.

19:32.338 --> 19:34.438
Got this impossible choice
to make right now.

19:34.440 --> 19:36.007
You know what you should do?

19:36.009 --> 19:37.775
-What?
-Don't be there.

19:39.012 --> 19:40.178
But I wanna be there.

19:40.180 --> 19:43.381
Well, then you deserve
what you get.

19:43.383 --> 19:44.515
What's it gonna be?

19:44.517 --> 19:46.317
You got two great people.

19:46.319 --> 19:49.854
One follows the rules,
one likes to break 'em.

19:49.856 --> 19:50.888
Yeah.

19:50.890 --> 19:53.824
One very blonde,
one very brunette.

19:53.826 --> 19:55.326
Yup.

19:55.328 --> 19:57.228
-Gotta choose, man.
-I know.

19:59.499 --> 20:01.532
So, who do you like better?
Me or Farkle?

20:02.702 --> 20:04.368
(chuckles) Oh.

20:06.372 --> 20:08.873
Congratulations, Riley.
You did it.

20:08.875 --> 20:10.508
I had help.

20:10.510 --> 20:12.076
You would've been fine
without me.

20:12.078 --> 20:13.978
I don't really see it
that way, Dad.

20:13.980 --> 20:15.379
None of us do.

20:15.381 --> 20:17.481
Thank you for teaching
my daughter so well.

20:17.483 --> 20:19.317
My pleasure.

20:19.319 --> 20:21.719
I don't think Farkle would've
reached his full potential
without you, Cory.

20:21.721 --> 20:22.887
Thanks, Minkus.

20:22.889 --> 20:24.155
He had a lot
to live up to.

20:24.157 --> 20:26.557
Thanks. That's why we want
to see that he does.

20:26.559 --> 20:27.992
Of course he will.

20:27.994 --> 20:30.528
I don't really think
you understand, Dad.

20:30.530 --> 20:31.862
What?

20:31.864 --> 20:33.397
Their class prank.

20:33.399 --> 20:35.533
Oh, you haven't heard
about that?

20:35.535 --> 20:37.768
No. What'd they do?

20:37.770 --> 20:41.005
Well, we started
talking about legacy...

20:41.007 --> 20:42.440
About what we left behind...

20:42.442 --> 20:44.242
And what we don't want
to leave behind...

20:44.244 --> 20:46.210
What we wanted
to take with us...

20:46.212 --> 20:47.511
This is good.

20:47.513 --> 20:48.946
We stole somethin' from school.

20:48.948 --> 20:51.549
-You what?
-This is good.

20:51.551 --> 20:53.117
Well, put it back!

20:53.119 --> 20:55.019
Nope. It's ours now.

20:55.021 --> 20:57.788
We captured the real
John Quincy Adams mascot,

20:57.790 --> 20:58.923
and we're taking it with us.

20:58.925 --> 21:00.358
What did you guys do?

21:01.527 --> 21:02.927
We stole you.

21:02.929 --> 21:05.062
I told you this was good.

21:05.064 --> 21:07.098
What are you talkin' about?

21:07.100 --> 21:08.699
I called up Uncle Jonathan

21:08.701 --> 21:11.535
and I told him that you had
a lot more to teach us.

21:11.537 --> 21:13.638
She got you promoted, Daddy!

21:13.640 --> 21:15.906
Of course, the superintendent
of schools didn't want

21:15.908 --> 21:17.742
to move teachers around
for only one student,

21:17.744 --> 21:19.877
so there would have to be
a lot of other people

21:19.879 --> 21:21.312
who thought you knew
what you were doing.

21:21.314 --> 21:23.214
So, the parents put together
a little petition,

21:23.216 --> 21:25.383
got some signatures,
and we presented it to him.

21:25.385 --> 21:26.984
I was very convincing.

21:28.388 --> 21:29.654
How many parents?

21:31.791 --> 21:33.107
All of 'em.

21:33.108 --> 21:34.424
We want our children
to have the best.

21:34.427 --> 21:36.460
You're going
to high school, Cory.

21:36.462 --> 21:37.828
Again.

21:37.830 --> 21:39.930
(chuckles)

21:39.932 --> 21:41.866
We get to stay together.

21:43.469 --> 21:46.270
You said that you had
a lot more to teach us.

21:46.272 --> 21:47.972
And now, you can.

21:56.582 --> 21:58.649
-Still like him?
-Yeah.

21:58.651 --> 21:59.684
You?

21:59.686 --> 22:01.585
Yeah.

22:01.587 --> 22:03.554
Okay. I'll check again tomorrow.

22:10.530 --> 22:11.996
Any change?

22:13.266 --> 22:14.498
No.

22:14.500 --> 22:16.100
I've felt the same
way about you

22:16.102 --> 22:18.569
ever since I fell
into your lap
on the subway.

22:19.772 --> 22:20.805
You?

22:20.807 --> 22:23.674
There was this
campfire, y'see.

22:23.676 --> 22:25.543
You and me.
I was in a far away place.

22:25.545 --> 22:27.645
There was a million stars
in the sky.

22:27.647 --> 22:29.046
What do you think?

22:29.048 --> 22:32.450
I think I don't want
anybody to be hurt.

22:32.452 --> 22:34.685
I think we don't know
how to stop that.

22:37.023 --> 22:38.356
Still like him?

22:41.194 --> 22:42.526
Yeah.

22:43.896 --> 22:44.962
You?

22:48.634 --> 22:49.867
Yeah.

22:52.238 --> 22:53.738
-Still like us?
-Yeah.

22:58.811 --> 22:59.977
Okay.
