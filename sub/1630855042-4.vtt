Aww. How are you?

Hey. Welcome to tour.

Thank you. Oh, my God.

Oh, yeah, it's my alias,
Dom Pagnotti.

00:37.786 --> 00:39.756
I wanted you to feel
what I feel when I arrive.

00:39.756 --> 00:41.727
- Okay, cool. I love it.
- Yeah. Welcome.

00:41.727 --> 00:43.230
- Hi.
- I'll get your bag.

00:43.230 --> 00:45.067
Oh, thank you.

00:45.067 --> 00:46.604
- Let's go on the bus. Come on.
- ALLY: You guys, I'm here.

00:46.604 --> 00:48.808
DAVE:
Come on, everybody in,
everybody in.

00:48.808 --> 00:50.444
- This is Cliff.
- Hi, Cliff.

00:50.444 --> 00:52.214
- I'm Ally.
- How you doing?

00:52.214 --> 00:54.720
Listen, no shitting on the bus.
You shit, you split.

00:54.720 --> 00:56.356

01:07.311 --> 01:09.248
Can you do this shit back there?

01:09.248 --> 01:11.119
We owe this queen some respect.

01:11.119 --> 01:12.288
- Yeah.
- DAVE: Oh, real classy.

01:12.288 --> 01:13.758
- Ooh.
- EMMA: What?

01:13.758 --> 01:14.793
Kicking the Black men
to the back of the bus.

01:14.793 --> 01:16.530
I'm just giving you a hard time.

01:16.530 --> 01:17.632
- EMMA: Okay.
- This is how we talk.

01:17.632 --> 01:19.168
- EMMA: Yeah.
- Tour life.

01:19.168 --> 01:20.805
Uh, how is the search
for love going?

01:20.805 --> 01:22.542
Uh, really poorly.

01:22.542 --> 01:24.412
Not good.

01:24.412 --> 01:27.284
I thought it was gonna be like
the romantic climax of man.

01:27.284 --> 01:30.491
Uh, instead, it's really been
the stark reality

01:30.491 --> 01:32.294
of... humanity.

01:32.294 --> 01:33.531
Well, there was the girl
in Utah.

01:33.531 --> 01:35.835
Said she was big into LDS.

01:35.835 --> 01:37.706
- Oh, Latter Day Saints.
- DAVE: Yeah, I didn't know that.

01:37.706 --> 01:39.175
I thought she
was talking baseball.

01:39.175 --> 01:41.479
- ALLY: Why?
- Like the NLDS.

01:41.479 --> 01:44.753
- MIKE: The National...
- DAVE: It was totally coincided
with that round of the...

01:44.753 --> 01:46.624
He thinks normal human flaws
are red flags.

01:46.624 --> 01:48.393
ALLY:
Sure, sounds reasonable.

01:48.393 --> 01:50.598
I mean, a big one is that
if they're not Rachel McAdams,

01:50.598 --> 01:51.767
- that's probably a...
- ALLY: Ugh.

01:51.767 --> 01:53.436
A classic.

01:53.436 --> 01:54.840
There was one girl that
I really didn't like

01:54.840 --> 01:55.842
the way she danced,
she was a bad dancer.

01:55.842 --> 01:57.779
- Mm.
- Dave...

01:57.779 --> 01:59.382
I love bad dancers

01:59.382 --> 02:01.319
who have, like, all that...
spirit and charm.

02:01.319 --> 02:02.722
But when you're a bad dancer,

02:02.722 --> 02:04.292
and you think that you're not,

02:04.292 --> 02:06.195
and like you're trying
to be cool,

02:06.195 --> 02:07.231
but you're not,

02:07.231 --> 02:08.534
that's a bad attitude.

02:08.534 --> 02:10.270
And I don't-- I can't--
I can't do that.

02:10.270 --> 02:12.909
Wait. By the way,
can you do me a favor?

02:12.909 --> 02:15.915
Can you add a name
to the list, for tonight?

02:15.915 --> 02:17.585
Please. It's my pleasure,
that's my power.

02:17.585 --> 02:19.388
We can do that. We have--
We have that power.

02:19.388 --> 02:21.225
I know, but it's, that's my job.

02:21.225 --> 02:22.227
- Yeah, but I'm just
saying I could...
- What's his name?

02:22.227 --> 02:23.497
You can do it if you want.

02:23.497 --> 02:24.265
- MIKE: What is his name?
- Do your job.

02:24.265 --> 02:25.668
What's the name?

02:25.668 --> 02:27.639
Roy Winters.

02:27.639 --> 02:29.876
MIKE: Roy Winters,
the silent film actor.

02:29.876 --> 02:30.878
I love him.

02:30.878 --> 02:33.483
You strumpet.

02:34.452 --> 02:36.356
Okay, I knew that you
were going to do this.

02:36.356 --> 02:38.561
This Roy guy from college,
"they're just friends."

02:38.561 --> 02:41.366
All this time, Dave here
had a suspicion.

02:41.366 --> 02:43.637
Turns out, Dave here
was right again.

02:43.637 --> 02:45.440
I never hooked up with him.

02:45.440 --> 02:47.679
I just want to win the argument
that I've always won.

02:47.679 --> 02:49.415
ALLY:
I understand that.

02:49.415 --> 02:51.219
And I can't win it unless
you admit that I've won it.

02:51.219 --> 02:52.655
So what are you intentions
with this man?

02:52.655 --> 02:55.193
My intentions...

02:55.193 --> 02:57.932
(vocalizing)

02:57.932 --> 03:00.671
Great. Everybody's creaming.

03:00.671 --> 03:02.976
I love your vibe,
it's so chill right now.

03:02.976 --> 03:04.746
Thank you for saying that.

03:04.746 --> 03:08.921
I am just a chill girl about
to have some casual sex.

03:08.921 --> 03:10.491
What do you want to do first?

03:10.491 --> 03:12.495
You want to roll me around
in a stroller

03:12.495 --> 03:14.198
while I smoke this baby?

03:14.198 --> 03:17.204
No, I said I'm gonna
see you at the show.

03:17.204 --> 03:20.712
But beforehand,
I need to be Rhianna.

03:20.712 --> 03:22.716
And focus on my...

03:22.716 --> 03:24.619
Well, can I just point out
that Rhianna

03:24.619 --> 03:26.623
is notoriously
a very good friend

03:26.623 --> 03:28.460
and she would go to
the botanical gardens

03:28.460 --> 03:29.563
with me and smoke.

03:29.563 --> 03:31.500
Will you do this?

03:31.500 --> 03:33.369
- Yeah, I got you.
- ALLY: Yay.

03:33.369 --> 03:36.375
- Here.
- Thank you.

03:36.375 --> 03:39.516
Oh, by the way,
should I wear, uh, this?

03:39.516 --> 03:40.885
Yeah, that's cute,
I like that one.

03:40.885 --> 03:44.225
Stop. You're fucking gorgeous.

03:44.225 --> 03:45.728
Which is like...

03:45.728 --> 03:47.699
coming here to fuck Roy Winters?

03:47.699 --> 03:49.736
Why? You've known him
for ten years.

03:49.736 --> 03:51.607
It's like fucking an iPhone 5.

03:51.607 --> 03:54.412
Jim just hurt my feelings
and was all...

03:54.412 --> 03:55.882
"I don't have
the emotional bandwidth

03:55.882 --> 03:57.852
for a relationship right now."

03:57.852 --> 03:59.923
And Roy has always said
that I'm his dream girl

03:59.923 --> 04:01.794
and so it's easy.

04:01.794 --> 04:03.329
You have a fucking vagina.

04:03.329 --> 04:04.900
It's always easy.

04:04.900 --> 04:07.371
You could literally stand there
and they'd fuck you.

04:07.371 --> 04:08.774
You could walk outside,

04:08.774 --> 04:10.511
everybody wants to fuck you.

04:10.511 --> 04:11.880
The goal is to not get fucked.

04:11.880 --> 04:13.551
Hmm.

04:13.551 --> 04:14.886
Not tonight.

04:14.886 --> 04:17.492
- Cheers to that.
- Mm-hmm.

04:17.492 --> 04:19.729
Will you look at my butthole
real quick?

04:19.729 --> 04:21.700
I think I cut it while shaving.

04:21.700 --> 04:22.702
- Check, check.
- Man, these sound crispy.

04:22.702 --> 04:23.704
Check, check.

04:23.704 --> 04:25.307
Check, check, sound check.

04:25.307 --> 04:27.010
Check, check, check, check.

04:27.010 --> 04:28.581
Gata, what are your thoughts on
Madison, Wisconsin, brother?

04:28.581 --> 04:30.016
You rocking with it?

04:30.016 --> 04:31.520
Check, check.
Last time I was in Wisconsin,

04:31.520 --> 04:32.555
you ain't gonna believe it,

04:32.555 --> 04:33.824
I really pissed on a bitch.

04:33.824 --> 04:35.595
Okay. Those are
the kind of things

04:35.595 --> 04:36.830
you shouldn't say
into the microphone.

04:36.830 --> 04:38.767
Because other people
can hear it,

04:38.767 --> 04:40.505
and you can get cancelled,
then I...

04:40.505 --> 04:41.740
She wanted me to do it, bro.
I'm just letting you know

04:41.740 --> 04:43.443
the energy is dope
out here, bro.

04:43.443 --> 04:46.382
Man, I fucked a bitch out here
with my socks off.

04:46.382 --> 04:47.819
You normally fuck
with your socks on?

04:47.819 --> 04:49.054
Check, check, check, check.

04:49.054 --> 04:50.090
Check.

04:50.090 --> 04:51.727
- Check, check.
- Hey.

04:51.727 --> 04:53.429
- Hey. Oh, yeah. Okay.
- I have to... I have to.

04:53.429 --> 04:54.766
Right, you know, can we talk
away from the stage?

04:54.766 --> 04:56.435
- Please?
- I have been waiting for hours.

04:56.435 --> 04:58.406
I know, but let's talk away
from the stage.

04:58.406 --> 04:59.810
- Okay, sure.
- All right, so...

04:59.810 --> 05:01.078
we don't have any time
to do this.

05:01.078 --> 05:02.649
I know you want to do
the click stuff,

05:02.649 --> 05:04.051
but I just, we can't.

05:04.051 --> 05:05.855
I'm a photographer.
You guys booked this.

05:05.855 --> 05:07.892
I don't know why you're acting
like I'm just...

05:07.892 --> 05:10.363
voluntarily coming here
and wanting to...

05:10.363 --> 05:12.434
MIKE: My point is,
we got crunched for time.

05:12.434 --> 05:13.871
You're done.

05:13.871 --> 05:15.340
I'm confused.

05:15.340 --> 05:16.844
I've been here all day.

05:16.844 --> 05:18.547
The window that you told me

05:18.547 --> 05:20.551
was from 2:00 to 4:00,
it's now almost 4:30.

05:20.551 --> 05:21.553
And it just... (whooshes)

05:21.553 --> 05:22.956
closed right up on you.

05:22.956 --> 05:24.793
I feel like you really
mismanage your time

05:24.793 --> 05:26.095
and now you're
just being a dick.

05:26.095 --> 05:27.097
MIKE:
I'm sorry we ran into traffic

05:27.097 --> 05:28.534
and there was a big truck.

05:28.534 --> 05:29.736
And I think it was
a pilaf truck,

05:29.736 --> 05:31.405
- like rice-rice pilafs.
- Dude.

05:31.405 --> 05:32.775
- And they were block...
- If you're gonna lie,

05:32.775 --> 05:34.044
- just do it better.
- MIKE: That's not a lie.

05:34.044 --> 05:35.113
That's not a lie.
I don't know what you...

05:35.113 --> 05:36.415
Is everything okay down there?

05:36.415 --> 05:37.552
Yeah, everything
is totally fine.

05:37.552 --> 05:38.787
The picture girl's here.

05:38.787 --> 05:39.723
- I'm a photographer.
- And she's--

05:39.723 --> 05:40.758
Okay, same thing.

05:40.758 --> 05:41.827
Your organization

05:41.827 --> 05:43.463
is incredibly disorganized.

05:43.463 --> 05:45.133
Should I come resolve
the situation?

05:45.133 --> 05:46.570
- Yes.
- No. Please just
finish sound check.

05:46.570 --> 05:47.772
I'm having trouble
hearing you guys.

05:47.772 --> 05:48.841
I'm not a picture girl,
that's...

05:48.841 --> 05:50.778
It's the same thing, kind of.

05:50.778 --> 05:52.014
- You take pictures.
- I don't think
that's true at all.

05:52.014 --> 05:53.951
- Look what you did.
- Excuse me?

05:53.951 --> 05:55.053
Look what you did.

05:55.053 --> 05:56.155
Are you joking?

05:56.155 --> 05:57.457
- Dude, I...
- Hi.

05:57.457 --> 05:58.961
What's going on?

05:58.961 --> 06:00.631
- Hi. I'm Robyn.
- Dave. Nice to meet you, Robyn.

06:00.631 --> 06:01.767
- Nice to meet you.
- DAVE: Nice jumpsuit.

06:01.767 --> 06:03.904
- Uh, thanks.
- DAVE: Funky.

06:03.904 --> 06:05.841
- Funky.
- For the magazine spread,

06:05.841 --> 06:07.845
I have to take photos,
it's a whole layout,

06:07.845 --> 06:09.616
- I can't just get photos
of you onstage.
- DAVE: Of course not.

06:09.616 --> 06:11.720
I am now being told
that I have no time.

06:11.720 --> 06:13.591
Well, who the heck
is saying that?

06:13.591 --> 06:14.759
- I did.
- He is.

06:14.759 --> 06:16.062
- Oh, this guy?
- That's right.

06:16.062 --> 06:17.665
You can't listen
to a word he says.

06:17.665 --> 06:19.401
He's got it all wrong
all the time.

06:19.401 --> 06:21.138
I mean, I'm just kidding, but...

06:21.138 --> 06:23.176
it does feel like some sort
of mismanaged situation

06:23.176 --> 06:24.411
- has occurred.
- It's not mismanaged at all.
That's not true...

06:24.411 --> 06:26.449
It does sound exactly like that.

06:26.449 --> 06:28.052
I can't really be controlled.

06:28.052 --> 06:29.889
And that's kind of like
the elephant in the room here.

06:29.889 --> 06:31.392
He's realizing that,

06:31.392 --> 06:32.795
he's probably gonna walk
away very soon.

06:32.795 --> 06:33.964
Yep. See?

06:33.964 --> 06:36.068
Bye.

06:36.068 --> 06:37.705
(chuckles) Off the record.

06:37.705 --> 06:38.974
There's no record.

06:38.974 --> 06:40.578
I'm just here to take photos.

06:40.578 --> 06:41.980
Off the visual record.

06:41.980 --> 06:44.686
One thing you should realize
is I'm sorry.

06:44.686 --> 06:48.426
Why would... saying sorry
be off the record?

06:48.426 --> 06:50.765
I don't know.

06:50.765 --> 06:53.136
In all seriousness,
I do feel terrible.

afternoon if need be.

06:59.950 --> 07:02.822
Okay, well, I don't actually
have the whole afternoon.

07:02.822 --> 07:05.060

07:05.060 --> 07:08.466
But I do have a kind of fun,

07:08.466 --> 07:11.005
non-traditional idea
if you're down.

07:11.005 --> 07:12.441
Will it be non-traditional

07:12.441 --> 07:14.078

non-traditional?

07:14.078 --> 07:15.615
Uh...

Quick question. In what world

07:55.060 --> 07:57.064
would I still be drinking
Midori Sours?

07:57.064 --> 07:58.834
In my world.

07:58.834 --> 08:00.103

we're still in college

08:00.103 --> 08:01.840

Um, you flew out here

08:09.556 --> 08:11.092
to take me to your
ex-boyfriend's concert?

08:11.092 --> 08:14.699
Yeah, because that's like
a totally normal and adult...

08:14.699 --> 08:17.972
- emotionally stable thing to do.
- Totally.

08:17.972 --> 08:19.542
Which is what I thought
when you reached out

08:19.542 --> 08:20.945
and then I had the thought like

08:20.945 --> 08:22.682
we should also, we should
hit up my ex-wife.

08:22.682 --> 08:24.686
Okay, I'm glad that you said it.

08:24.686 --> 08:26.188

08:29.596 --> 08:30.931
- Okay.
- Sorry.

08:30.931 --> 08:32.267
She's not a bitch.

08:32.267 --> 08:33.704
- Or may-- I mean, probably.
- Debatable.

08:33.704 --> 08:35.674
Ex-wife.

08:35.674 --> 08:37.144
That's like so adult of you.

08:37.144 --> 08:40.083
- It is, isn't it?
- You've been like fully married.

08:40.083 --> 08:41.953
- Fully.
- And then fully divorced.

08:41.953 --> 08:43.122
- Fully.
- Which means...

08:43.122 --> 08:45.661
that you could be
a Real Housewife.

08:45.661 --> 08:47.230
You know?

08:47.230 --> 08:49.101
Honestly, the whole thing was...

08:49.101 --> 08:50.270
pretty traumatic.

08:50.270 --> 08:52.942
- Yeah.
- Um, kind of like...

08:52.942 --> 08:54.244
wrecked me. I won't get
into the details

08:54.244 --> 08:56.583
- of all of it, but...

08:56.583 --> 08:58.119

I mean, we're not like
best friends

09:02.562 --> 09:03.864

It's like inside of me.

09:09.141 --> 09:10.745
You swallowed a bug?

09:10.745 --> 09:12.180
Um, here, you should
probably drink this.

09:12.180 --> 09:14.586

It'll kill the... larvae.

I said I love this.

09:26.710 --> 09:28.747
Move your body but just

09:54.331 --> 09:55.801

09:55.801 --> 09:57.337
Uh...

09:57.337 --> 10:01.045
Uh, I don't like hooking up
with girls like that.

10:01.045 --> 10:02.782
- Right.
- Is the implication that

10:02.782 --> 10:04.686
- I carry myself like a player?
- No.

10:04.686 --> 10:06.288
Yes. Not... No, no.

10:06.288 --> 10:07.825
- Ultimately, no.
- Mm.

10:07.825 --> 10:09.929

a girlfriend, really.

10:09.929 --> 10:11.232

Up to my neck
in big dick energy?

10:20.784 --> 10:22.087

to ask you about your life.

10:22.087 --> 10:23.356

die in Wisconsin?

for a change.

16:38.138 --> 16:41.713
Yeah, yeah,
no conversation needed.

16:41.713 --> 16:45.186
It's like just one night
only, you know?

16:48.392 --> 16:50.363
- I don't know
what I'm doing. Music.
- Oh.

16:50.363 --> 16:52.300
- I should turn some music on.
- Yeah.

16:52.300 --> 16:54.705
Rock on, baby. (chuckles)

16:56.241 --> 16:58.078
- What'd you think of the show?
- I loved it.

16:58.078 --> 17:00.216
I can't believe
I haven't showered.

17:00.216 --> 17:02.186
Tough to do a concert
and not shower and be so...

17:02.186 --> 17:03.389
- (mumbles, sniffs)
- You like it?

17:03.389 --> 17:05.092
Yeah.

17:05.092 --> 17:06.729
Wait, isn't this exactly
where we were, earlier today?

17:06.729 --> 17:08.032
Yeah. I live here.

17:08.032 --> 17:10.203
- You live here?
- Yeah.

17:10.203 --> 17:11.706
Why didn't you tell me
that you lived here?

17:11.706 --> 17:13.577
I just generally don't
like to, you know,

17:13.577 --> 17:16.348
tell people that I'm working
with that I live in the space.

17:16.348 --> 17:18.118
- (music playing loudly outside)
- Oh.

17:18.118 --> 17:20.189
Ugh!

17:20.189 --> 17:24.231
Every night, my neighbor
just plays this music,

17:24.231 --> 17:25.366
it's really annoying actually.

17:25.366 --> 17:27.771
Is it always like this here?

17:27.771 --> 17:29.642
- It's not, it's...
- It's a big party neighborhood?

17:29.642 --> 17:31.278
I don't think there's a party.

17:31.278 --> 17:33.115
That's-- Cute.

17:33.115 --> 17:34.518
DAVE: There's like a little bit
of a buzz on the block.

17:34.518 --> 17:36.789
So you got to be
in here every night just...

17:36.789 --> 17:38.359
- doing stuff like this?
- ROBYN: Never.

17:38.359 --> 17:40.096
I really can't dance. I-I...

17:40.096 --> 17:41.465
It's like my most
embarrassing quality.

17:41.465 --> 17:43.102
- Oh, please, everyone can dance.
- No, no, I--

17:43.102 --> 17:44.237
- I-I hate it about myself.
- Everyone can dance.

17:44.237 --> 17:45.774
- No.
- Tonight you do, come on.

17:45.774 --> 17:47.511
- No, I...
- Why not? What's wrong
with dancing?

17:47.511 --> 17:49.114
- It's so easy. You just...
- My joints are like...

17:49.114 --> 17:50.584

Do something.

17:52.253 --> 17:53.222

Uh, well...

a cut on my cuticle here.

can you get HIV

23:21.111 --> 23:24.718

on a finger and...

23:24.718 --> 23:27.456
the finger's fingering?

23:27.456 --> 23:31.499
I was just, like,
evaluating the odds.

23:31.499 --> 23:33.937

23:33.937 --> 23:36.174

23:38.680 --> 23:40.482
crazy thoughts?

23:40.482 --> 23:42.219
I sleep really well, actually.

23:42.219 --> 23:43.890
- Really?
- Eight hours a night.

23:43.890 --> 23:45.459
- Surprising.
- Really?

23:45.459 --> 23:47.764
You have the personality
of a real insomniac.

23:47.764 --> 23:49.000
No, I created a total
thought process

23:49.000 --> 23:51.137
that just works like a charm.

23:51.137 --> 23:52.874
What is it?

23:52.874 --> 23:56.047
- Okay, I'll tell you.
Yeah, buckle up.
- What?

23:56.047 --> 23:57.751
- Okay.
- Okay.

23:57.751 --> 24:00.189
- So I imagine
that it's the Holocaust.
- Okay.

24:00.189 --> 24:01.892
Yeah.

24:01.892 --> 24:03.496
And that I am in Nazi Germany

24:03.496 --> 24:05.667
and I have been on the run
for like 18 days.

24:05.667 --> 24:07.036
Couldn't be colder.
It's winter, by the way.

24:07.036 --> 24:09.508
There's snow
all over the ground.

24:09.508 --> 24:11.979
It's the most stressful
thing in the world.

24:11.979 --> 24:14.952
And I've finally arrived
at a family friend's house.

24:14.952 --> 24:17.791
They bring me up
to the attic, right?

24:17.791 --> 24:22.834
And we go up to that attic
and it's so warm.

24:22.834 --> 24:25.072
- Mm.
- There's like wood floors,

24:25.072 --> 24:27.711
there's a fireplace always to
the left, crackling fireplace,

24:27.711 --> 24:30.850
and then out the window, you
can see like the amber light

24:30.850 --> 24:33.723
and the snow just
like falling slowly.

24:33.723 --> 24:35.192
And I don't even
have a mattress,

24:35.192 --> 24:38.599
I can hear the hum of
the militia and the tanks

24:38.599 --> 24:40.804
and the Nazis like barking
at one another,

24:40.804 --> 24:42.841
but at that moment
it doesn't even matter.

24:42.841 --> 24:45.747
Because I'm so warm,
I'm so cozy,

24:45.747 --> 24:48.118
and I'm so tired,

24:48.118 --> 24:50.824
and then I just wake up
eight hours later.

24:50.824 --> 24:52.594
Wow. That's...

24:52.594 --> 24:54.230
You get it, right?

24:54.230 --> 24:55.533
Yeah.

25:02.748 --> 25:06.589

I've ever had.

25:06.589 --> 25:09.093
Yeah.

25:09.093 --> 25:11.599

25:11.599 --> 25:13.870

25:13.870 --> 25:16.575
you know that every single guy
in Wisconsin

25:16.575 --> 25:18.111
is gonna descend upon you

25:18.111 --> 25:19.848
and you're gonna have
your total pick of the litter.

25:19.848 --> 25:23.556
And you're gonna make
some guy's dreams come true.

25:25.059 --> 25:26.729
Yeah.

25:33.609 --> 25:35.980
Oh, what time is it?

25:37.617 --> 25:38.986
It's late.

25:38.986 --> 25:41.191
Feels late.

25:41.191 --> 25:43.563
Feels late and early at once.

25:45.065 --> 25:47.671
Um, I don't want to be rude,

25:47.671 --> 25:50.342

so early tomorrow

25:50.342 --> 25:53.616

time it was until just now.

25:53.616 --> 25:55.620

25:55.620 --> 25:59.127

don't want to fuck it up and...

25:59.127 --> 26:02.266
I really have to...
call it a night.

26:02.266 --> 26:03.301
It's a big thing.

26:03.301 --> 26:04.738
I get it. You're a... Career.

26:04.738 --> 26:06.609
Maybe it's just better--
I-I don't...

26:06.609 --> 26:07.611
- You're a career woman.
- I didn't know how late it was.

26:07.611 --> 26:08.880
You need to sleep. I understand.

26:08.880 --> 26:10.082
No one empathizes
with that situation

26:10.082 --> 26:12.219
more than me, I get it.
(exhales)

26:12.219 --> 26:13.321
Yeah.

26:14.925 --> 26:16.762
I have your number.

26:16.762 --> 26:18.933
(chuckles weakly)

26:18.933 --> 26:20.302
- Oh, no.
- Yeah.

26:20.302 --> 26:22.239
You said that?

26:22.239 --> 26:25.112
I don't even know if that's the
comment that turned the tide,

26:25.112 --> 26:27.784
and if it was, I was just
being complimentary, like...

26:27.784 --> 26:29.120
Yeah, but you don't need to...

26:29.120 --> 26:32.093
like tell the truth
all the time.

26:32.093 --> 26:34.865
You could, you know, just...

26:35.800 --> 26:37.871
She was great, I thought.

26:38.973 --> 26:40.910
Okay, well, then don't
give up on her.

26:40.910 --> 26:43.048
Like call her
from the road or whatever.

26:43.048 --> 26:45.385
Honestly, if you're gonna
get that thrown

26:45.385 --> 26:47.089
by one small comment,

26:47.089 --> 26:49.661
then there's some deeper
insecurity, like underneath.

26:49.661 --> 26:52.133
And I'm happy I saw it
sooner than later, so...

26:52.133 --> 26:56.040
Dave, you have to forgive people
for not being perfect.

26:58.779 --> 27:00.850
Enough about me.
What happened with Roy?

27:00.850 --> 27:05.794
(sighs) I'm realizing that
I can't just... hook up.

27:05.794 --> 27:07.664
Like, it doesn't have
to mean everything,

27:07.664 --> 27:12.406
but it can't mean nothing,
if that makes sense.

27:12.406 --> 27:15.379
Makes perfect sense. I get it.

27:15.379 --> 27:17.349
But, you know, I'm just...

27:17.349 --> 27:20.122
trying to fill the void,
I guess.

27:20.122 --> 27:23.361
That is me every single night.

27:23.361 --> 27:25.332
Especially on tour.

27:26.434 --> 27:29.942
But... there's still time.

27:32.146 --> 27:33.850
Yeah.

27:39.026 --> 27:40.763
You know, I've never
told you this,

27:40.763 --> 27:43.134
but the best thing
that you've ever done

27:43.134 --> 27:46.307
is not get back together
with me when I tried to.

27:46.307 --> 27:48.011
Why? Because you're...

27:48.011 --> 27:50.750
America's most
eligible bachelor now?

27:50.750 --> 27:52.386
No, because I would've
fucked it up between us

27:52.386 --> 27:53.856
and you don't deserve
that at all.

27:53.856 --> 27:55.125
We're in such a good place

27:55.125 --> 27:56.762
and I'm so happy
to have you in my life

27:56.762 --> 27:58.265
and anyone who doesn't
want you in their lives

27:58.265 --> 28:00.002
is a fucking loser.

28:00.002 --> 28:02.908
You deserve everything.

28:07.784 --> 28:09.755
LD, what's good, bro?

28:09.755 --> 28:12.026
I got more flavors
than Baskin-Robbins, bro.

28:12.026 --> 28:13.195
- Got them lined up for you.
- Oh.

28:13.195 --> 28:14.798
Classic Gata.

28:14.798 --> 28:16.802
I'm okay, man.
This guy's out of his mind.

28:16.802 --> 28:18.138
GATA: You sure?
I've been listening to you, bro.

28:18.138 --> 28:19.808
I got all the types
you said, bro.

28:19.808 --> 28:21.444
I got the neighborhood girl,
around-the-way look,

28:21.444 --> 28:23.048
all that shit you
was talking about?

28:23.048 --> 28:24.885
Let me just see if
he has an understanding

28:24.885 --> 28:26.822
of the type of woman
I'm even interested in.

28:26.822 --> 28:28.358
- Yeah.
- Like I made him watch
Wedding Crashers,

28:28.358 --> 28:30.162
it's just good for the rest
of the tour that he...

28:30.162 --> 28:32.433
One second. Be right back.
