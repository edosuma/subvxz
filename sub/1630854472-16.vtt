[CHUCKLES]

04:50.649 --> 04:54.193
SO, WHAT ARE MY DUTIES

04:54.293 --> 04:56.595

RUSH PARTIES WITH ALCOHOL

04:56.695 --> 04:58.597
THIS CLOSE TO CAMPUS,

04:58.697 --> 05:01.320

OLIVIA: IF YOU DON'T

05:25.764 --> 05:26.946
SO THAT SHE CAN
CHANGE IT BEFORE

05:27.046 --> 05:28.307
YOU OFFICIALLY LAUNCH
THE REBRAND.

05:28.407 --> 05:29.548
YEAH, IT'S NOT THAT
I DON'T LIKE IT.

05:29.648 --> 05:30.990
IT'S JUST...LIKE,

05:31.090 --> 05:32.992
IF I REBRAND AND GO BY
KEATING RECORDS,

05:33.092 --> 05:35.154
IT FEELS LIKE...

05:35.254 --> 05:37.196
IT FEELS LIKE I'M
ABANDONING MY MOM'S LEGACY

05:37.296 --> 05:38.757
AND EVERYTHING I DID
TO BUILD FORMONICA.

05:38.857 --> 05:40.319
WELL, THEN KEEP
THE NAME FORMONICA.

05:40.419 --> 05:42.241
YEAH, BUT I FOUGHT CLAY
TO GET OUR NAME BACK,

05:42.341 --> 05:45.284
AND EVERYTHING THAT
HAPPENED WITH MY DAD...

05:45.384 --> 05:47.486
I KNOW I'D FEEL GUILTY
NOT USING KEATING RECORDS.

05:47.586 --> 05:50.729
SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE IN ONE OF
THOSE CAN'T-WIN SITUATIONS.

05:50.829 --> 05:52.091
I FEEL YOU THERE.

05:52.191 --> 05:53.252
YOU KNOW HOW
MY BOUNTYGATE ARTICLE

05:53.352 --> 05:54.813
GOT NOMINATED FOR AN AWARD?

05:54.913 --> 05:56.855
WELL, NOT ANY AWARD,
THE AWARD.

05:56.955 --> 05:58.857
YEAH, WELL, I DIDN'T
EVEN GET INVITED

05:58.957 --> 06:00.619
TO THE AWARD CEREMONY.

06:00.719 --> 06:02.341
JAYDEN DAVIS DID.

06:02.441 --> 06:05.344
I KNOW IT WAS THE RIGHT
DECISION AT THE TIME.

06:05.444 --> 06:07.746
I JUST...I DON'T KNOW.
I KINDA WISH

06:07.846 --> 06:10.029
I NEVER USED A PSEUDONYM.

06:10.129 --> 06:11.870
WELL, IF I'M BEING HONEST,

06:11.970 --> 06:14.633
I WAS SURPRISED
YOU PICKED JAYDEN DAVIS
AS YOUR PSEUDONYM.

06:14.733 --> 06:18.357
WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO YOUR
GOOD FRIEND LARISSA MEYERS?

06:18.457 --> 06:21.160
OH, MY GOD!
LARISSA MEYERS.

06:21.260 --> 06:24.003
THAT WAS THE BEST
SECRET IDENTITY NAME EVER.

06:24.103 --> 06:25.444
WELL, MINE WAS BETTER.

06:25.544 --> 06:26.926
OH, RIGHT,
MISS "TWILIGHT" PHASE
GOING AROUND

06:27.026 --> 06:28.687
MAKING PEOPLE
CALL YOU BELLA SWAN?

06:28.787 --> 06:30.889
OK, YOU'RE JUST JEALOUS
THAT I PICKED FIRST.

06:30.989 --> 06:32.611
I DON'T THINK I AM.

06:32.711 --> 06:34.653
REMEMBER HOW WE USED TO
PRETEND TO BE THEM

06:34.753 --> 06:37.216
TO GET AWAY FROM OUR
MIDDLE SCHOOL PROBLEMS?

06:37.316 --> 06:39.738
I MISS
MIDDLE SCHOOL PROBLEMS.

06:39.838 --> 06:41.840
ME, TOO.

06:42.241 --> 06:44.944
WELL, I CAN'T BRING BACK
LARISSA AND BELLA,

06:45.044 --> 06:47.906
BUT I CAN OFFER
A DIFFERENT DISTRACTION.

06:48.006 --> 06:49.388
COME HANG WITH
PATIENCE AND ME.

06:49.488 --> 06:51.190
WE'RE GONNA WATCH SKYE
GIVE A PRESENTATION

06:51.290 --> 06:52.911
ABOUT NAVIGATING SOCIAL MEDIA
AS AN INFLUENCER.

06:53.011 --> 06:55.194
SO, COULD BE FUN.

06:55.294 --> 06:56.395
IF IT MEANS THAT
I DON'T HAVE TO

06:56.495 --> 06:59.558
THINK ABOUT THIS
AWARD CEREMONY,

06:59.658 --> 07:00.559
COUNT ME IN.

07:00.659 --> 07:02.661
OK.

07:05.104 --> 07:06.005
WHAT'S THIS?

07:06.105 --> 07:07.206
THAT IS A LIST OF

07:07.306 --> 07:08.407
POTENTIAL RECRUITS.

07:08.507 --> 07:11.130
I RECOGNISE SOME OF
THESE NAMES.

07:11.230 --> 07:12.931
THIS IS A WHO'S WHO
OF HAS-BEENS.

07:13.031 --> 07:14.333
AND THIS GUY'S
A NEVER-WAS

07:14.433 --> 07:15.774
AND THIS GUY'S IN PRISON.

07:15.874 --> 07:17.576
NO. HE--HE GOT OUT.

07:17.676 --> 07:19.578
DON'T YOU BELIEVE IN
SECOND CHANCES, COACH?

07:19.678 --> 07:21.420
I BELIEVE IN REBUILDING GAU
AND GIVING US

07:21.520 --> 07:24.423
THE BEST CHANCES
AT WINNING AGAIN.

07:24.523 --> 07:26.465
WHICH IS WHY I'M HOLDING
OPEN TRYOUTS TODAY.

07:26.565 --> 07:28.427
OH, THERE YOU GO.
INVITE THESE GUYS.

07:28.527 --> 07:29.908
CAN'T HURT TO
CHECK THEM OUT.

07:30.008 --> 07:33.032
IT CAN'T HURT?
YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?

07:33.132 --> 07:35.594
LOOK, MOST OF THESE GUYS
HAD BIG DREAMS.

07:35.694 --> 07:37.396
AND THEY'VE PROBABLY
ACCEPTED THE FACT THAT

07:37.496 --> 07:40.279
THOSE DREAMS ARE
NEVER GONNA COME TRUE.

07:40.379 --> 07:42.041
THEY'VE JUST MOVED ON.
SO, WHY

07:42.141 --> 07:44.443
WOULD WE WANNA GET
THEIR HOPES UP AGAIN?

07:44.543 --> 07:47.926
LISTEN, LISTEN, I KNOW YOU GUYS
ARE JUST TRYING TO HELP,

07:48.026 --> 07:49.088
BUT I GOT THIS.

07:49.188 --> 07:50.449
LET ME
HANDLE RECRUITING.

07:50.549 --> 07:52.251

KEEP GRINDING.

07:52.351 --> 07:54.893

AND BE READY TO BALL.
ALL RIGHT?

07:54.993 --> 07:56.575
YEAH.

07:56.675 --> 07:58.677
ALL RIGHT.

08:01.400 --> 08:03.142
[SIGH] YOU KNOW,
COACH KENNY'S GOT A POINT.

08:03.242 --> 08:04.903
JORDAN: I KNOW.
SPENCER: WE CAN'T BE
GETTING DUDES' HOPES UP,

08:05.003 --> 08:06.865
THINKING THEY GOT A SHOT.
JORDAN: YOU'RE RIGHT.

08:06.965 --> 08:08.507
HE'S RIGHT.

08:08.607 --> 08:10.429
ALL RIGHT. COOL.

08:10.529 --> 08:11.750
JORDAN: QUESTION.
SPENCER: YEAH. WHAT'S UP?

08:11.850 --> 08:14.473
WHAT IF...HYPOTHETICALLY,

08:14.573 --> 08:16.595
I ALREADY CALLED
ONE OF THE GUYS?
