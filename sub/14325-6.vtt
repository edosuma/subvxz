MY FAVORITE SOAP OPERA.

18:34.071 --> 18:35.030
THIS PLACE RULES!

18:35.114 --> 18:37.407
{\an1}IF ONLY I COULD MEET
A BOY CONFIDENT ENOUGH

18:37.491 --> 18:39.743
{\an1}TO ADMIT HE LIKES
<i>KISSY KISSY, GOO GOO,</i>

18:39.827 --> 18:40.536
I'D GO OUT WITH HIM

18:40.619 --> 18:43.664
{\an1}EVEN IF HE WORE
A STUPID PINK HAT.

18:43.747 --> 18:44.915
REALLY?

18:44.998 --> 18:47.376
BUT I'LL BET HE'D
NEVER COME IN HERE.

18:47.459 --> 18:48.168
WELL, HE SHOULD.

18:48.252 --> 18:49.294
{\an1}IF BOYS DID
MORE GIRL STUFF,

18:49.378 --> 18:52.047
{\an1}THEN GIRLS WOULD BE ABLE
TO DO MORE BOY STUFF.

18:52.130 --> 18:52.881
YOU KNOW WHAT,
TRIXIE?

18:52.965 --> 18:55.467
YOU'RE RIGHT.
COME ON!

18:57.678 --> 18:58.679
WHERE ARE WE GOING?

18:58.762 --> 19:01.765

AAH!

19:17.990 --> 19:20.117
NO, WAIT!

19:20.200 --> 19:21.660
I'M DOING THIS

{\an1}Chester: I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S UP WITH THOSE GIRLS,

19:27.332 --> 19:28.834
BUT WE'RE SAFE IN HERE.

19:28.917 --> 19:31.086
DON'T YOU THINK
YOU'RE OVERREACTING?

19:31.169 --> 19:31.879
{\an1}DUDE,

19:31.962 --> 19:33.505
BOYS LIKE COMICS,

19:33.589 --> 19:34.840
GIRLS LIKE DOLLS.

19:34.923 --> 19:36.884
BOYS LIKE VIDEO GAMES,

19:36.967 --> 19:37.843
GIRLS LIKE MAKEUP.

19:37.926 --> 19:39.970
WE'RE DIFFERENT!

19:40.053 --> 19:43.557
{\an1}THAT'S WHY WE HAVE
DIFFERENT BATHROOMS.

19:43.640 --> 19:45.726
[FLUSH]

19:46.143 --> 19:48.604
UM...AM I
IN THE WRONG ROOM?

19:48.687 --> 19:50.856
[SHRIEKS]

19:50.939 --> 19:53.984
NOTHING MAKES
SENSE ANYMORE.

19:54.067 --> 19:54.443
FROG?

19:56.695 --> 19:58.405
IT WAS NICE
MEETING YOU, TRIXIE.

19:58.488 --> 20:01.033

A DEADLY GERM?

21:13.605 --> 21:15.649

EXPECTS YOU TO BE...
A FRIEND TO YOU.

21:29.121 --> 21:30.247
SOMEONE WHO ISN'T
AFRAID TO SAY,

"HEY, I LIKE

INSTEAD OF JUST A GIRL,

21:58.984 --> 21:59.776

{\an1}AHH! IT'S LIKE THEY'RE
SCRUBBING ALL MY TROUBLES AWAY.
