WEBVTT

00:12.447 --> 00:15.319
Director Mueller just assigned
us a major case number.

00:15.406 --> 00:18.670
<i>Investigation'’s </i>
officially been dubbed
Amerithrax.

00:18.757 --> 00:20.237
<i>Whoever sent these </i>
letters got their Anthrax

00:20.324 --> 00:22.196
from an American lab.

00:22.283 --> 00:23.936
We wouldn'’t be here if we
didn'’t have evidence

00:24.024 --> 00:25.547
leading us
back to USAMRIID.

00:25.634 --> 00:26.896
Bruce Ivins
is our top anthrax man.

00:26.983 --> 00:29.246
Then I
wanna talk to him.

00:29.333 --> 00:31.466
They'’re treating us
like we'’re the enemy.
We'’re the heroes.

00:31.553 --> 00:34.730
The way in has to be
through his hero'’s complex.

00:34.817 --> 00:36.862
I know most Americans
aren'’t paying attention,

00:36.949 --> 00:39.648
but you guys had signs
that 9/11 was gonna happen.

00:39.735 --> 00:42.477
<i>And now you can'’t figure </i>
out who sent these letters.

00:42.564 --> 00:48.135
So instead you are harassing
hard working patriots like me.

00:48.222 --> 00:50.659
<i>Bruce, are you </i>
considering doing bodily
harm to someone?

00:52.878 --> 00:54.750
Did you
this, Dr. Ivins?

00:54.837 --> 00:57.100
<i>I had obsessive </i>
behaviors linked to sororities

00:57.187 --> 00:59.146
<i>specifically </i>
Kappa Kappa Gamma.

00:59.233 --> 01:01.844
<i>In the fall of </i>
2001, did you mail letters

01:01.931 --> 01:03.802
<i>containing Anthrax?</i>

01:03.889 --> 01:05.935
- No.
- Looks like he'’s
not your guy.

01:06.022 --> 01:07.893
<i>Our top </i>
suspect is Hatfill.

01:07.980 --> 01:09.939
<i>He just happened to be on the </i>
ground in Rhodesia

01:10.026 --> 01:12.985
during the most
deadly Anthrax outbreak
in recent history.

01:13.073 --> 01:15.249
Ryker, I'’m putting
you on Sykes'’ team.

01:15.336 --> 01:18.295
<i>REPORTER : FBI </i>
agents searched the home
of Steven Hatfill.

01:18.382 --> 01:20.123
Hatfill has a map.

01:20.210 --> 01:21.907
Looks like it leads to
a remote location in the woods.

01:21.994 --> 01:24.127
Still think
we got the wrong guy?

02:04.863 --> 02:07.127
Such a sweetheart.

02:28.670 --> 02:31.325
Good day.

02:31.412 --> 02:34.676
- Hello, mother.
- Hello, Bruce.

02:41.726 --> 02:43.772
Hello, papa.
What are you doing?

02:43.859 --> 02:49.778
Just crushing
some chlorpromazine pills
for Mrs. Bachmeyer.

02:49.865 --> 02:52.563
Uh-hmm.

02:52.650 --> 02:55.436
She has a hard
time swallowing them.

02:55.523 --> 02:57.307
And if she doesn'’t get enough.

02:57.394 --> 02:59.788
Ahhh!

03:18.110 --> 03:20.765
Press the other
side and there,

03:20.852 --> 03:23.377
it'’s called a
pharmacist'’s fold.

03:23.464 --> 03:24.682
It stops the powder from
spilling out before

03:24.769 --> 03:26.815
someone opens it.

04:07.725 --> 04:10.641
The map we found
at Hatfill'’s spans
acres of the place.

04:10.728 --> 04:13.557
But this dog had a
real boner for that pond.

04:13.644 --> 04:15.167
Well,
I'’ll give you this,

04:15.255 --> 04:17.953
secluded area, good
place to toss evidence.

04:18.040 --> 04:20.042
But you still don'’t
believe me, do you?

04:20.129 --> 04:23.524
Come on, the guy wrote a
book about a biological
attack on Washington.

04:23.611 --> 04:25.743
This is our guy, Ryker.

04:25.830 --> 04:27.919
I don'’t know.

04:28.006 --> 04:31.488
He'’s got a couple of
things stacked against him.

04:31.575 --> 04:33.751
Then again, maybe
he'’s like any of us,

04:33.838 --> 04:36.101
made a few questionable
judgment calls in life and

04:36.188 --> 04:39.017
we'’re just following the
plot of his fictional book.

04:46.198 --> 04:49.071
Agent Ryker, USRT
diver found something.

04:55.599 --> 04:57.035
Ryker, you ever
seen anything like it?

04:57.122 --> 04:58.950
No.

04:59.037 --> 05:02.737
But those holes are large
enough for hands to slide in.

05:02.824 --> 05:05.130
With gloves and cuff
rings affixed to it,

05:05.217 --> 05:07.045
it could be airtight.

05:07.132 --> 05:09.874
A makeshift biosafety box.

05:09.961 --> 05:11.398
Make sure that
goes into a bio-case.

05:11.485 --> 05:13.400
If there are any
spores left in there,

05:13.487 --> 05:14.270
I wanna make sure they don'’t
get shaken off during a bumpy

05:14.357 --> 05:16.272
ride to the lab.

05:16.359 --> 05:17.839
Yes, sir. Copy that,
we'’ll take care of it.

05:18.927 --> 05:20.320
Watch your back.

05:20.407 --> 05:22.060
Right, K-6 we'’re going to K-6.

05:22.147 --> 05:23.758
Hate to
say I told you so.

05:23.845 --> 05:27.283
Well, we'’ll get
to test it right away.

05:27.370 --> 05:29.329
We'’ll know soon enough.

05:48.304 --> 05:50.437
Did you get pulled
onto Sykes'’ team too?

05:50.524 --> 05:53.135
Seemed to avoid
the Seventh Circle of Hell
for one more day.

05:53.222 --> 05:54.789
I thought you
were following Ivins.

05:54.876 --> 05:57.226
I am.

06:00.316 --> 06:03.058
What the
hell is he doing here?

06:03.145 --> 06:05.756
It can'’t be a coincidence.

06:05.843 --> 06:08.368
We got a non-secure
person at the volunteer tent.

06:08.455 --> 06:09.630
Brown coat, black hat.

06:09.717 --> 06:11.762
Remove him immediately.

06:11.849 --> 06:13.503
<i>AGENT : Roger that.</i>

06:14.983 --> 06:16.463
Refill for a coffee?

06:16.550 --> 06:17.420
Sir, this is
a restricted area,

06:17.507 --> 06:19.161
you can'’t be here.

06:19.248 --> 06:20.902
No, no, no, I'’m
a first aid volunteer.

06:20.989 --> 06:22.556
Sir, you have to be on
the list now please.

06:22.643 --> 06:23.513
I'’m supposed to be here.
I'’m on the list.

06:23.600 --> 06:24.862
This way.

06:24.949 --> 06:26.124
No, no,
this is a mistake.

06:26.211 --> 06:27.561
This, uh, I don'’t understand.

06:27.648 --> 06:29.737
I got the, I got the
high clearance alert.

06:29.824 --> 06:30.955
That means I work
for the government,

06:31.042 --> 06:32.348
I work for the army.

06:32.435 --> 06:35.351
So they really
should have me here,

06:35.438 --> 06:36.787
because I'’m an expert.

06:36.874 --> 06:38.006
I'’m highly
qualified to be here.

06:38.093 --> 06:39.573
Why are they?

06:39.660 --> 06:42.314
What are you filming?

06:42.402 --> 06:45.535
This is a mistake. I'’m...

06:50.845 --> 06:53.804
Sir, I need to
get you in the car.

06:53.891 --> 06:56.416
Sir, in the car now.

06:57.286 --> 06:59.549
Okay.

07:06.208 --> 07:08.950
So you were there?

07:10.778 --> 07:12.997
I can'’t
disclose any details,

07:13.084 --> 07:16.174
but they brought me in to
help because of my expertise.

07:16.261 --> 07:17.524
It was all
over the news today.

07:17.611 --> 07:18.699
Uh, did you see anything?

07:18.786 --> 07:19.917
Did they have
any new evidence?

07:20.004 --> 07:22.311
I can'’t disclose that.

07:22.398 --> 07:25.096
I didn'’t get the level
of clearance I have by
being a blabbermouth.

07:27.142 --> 07:29.710
Sounds like you were
really essential, Bruce.

07:29.797 --> 07:33.888
Did you feel needed?

07:33.975 --> 07:38.022
You know, Dr. Halstrom,
I'’ve come to realize in my

07:38.109 --> 07:41.156
life that there are
two types of people.

07:41.243 --> 07:43.724
There are people whose job it
is to sit in a chair all day

07:43.811 --> 07:46.857
and ask questions, and then
there are a skilled few of us

07:46.944 --> 07:49.338
who find answers to them.

07:49.425 --> 07:52.210
One is clearly more
needed than the other.

08:10.402 --> 08:12.274
Good to go.

08:20.282 --> 08:21.718
Thank you. I appreciate
it, my friend, see you soon.

08:21.805 --> 08:23.154
Right in here, please.

08:23.241 --> 08:24.895
Yes, sir.

08:24.982 --> 08:27.419
Thank you.

08:31.336 --> 08:32.773
All right, stop there.

08:32.860 --> 08:34.339
Okay. Do it again
with the other one.

08:34.426 --> 08:35.427
Yeah.

08:35.515 --> 08:36.646
Wear the glove.

08:36.733 --> 08:38.430
Yeah. Uh-hmm.

08:38.518 --> 08:40.171
Yeah.
Whatever you want.

08:40.258 --> 08:41.216
A pen or...?

08:41.303 --> 08:43.653
Use the marker.

08:49.137 --> 08:51.574
Keep going.

08:53.010 --> 08:54.577
You see
what Sykes is doing?

08:54.664 --> 08:56.927
He'’s making Hatfill
give writing samples.

08:57.014 --> 08:58.929
Seems routine to me.

08:59.016 --> 09:00.583
With an oven mitt on?

09:00.670 --> 09:01.671
It'’s not
the most accurate,

09:01.758 --> 09:04.195
but it can disguise lettering.

09:07.938 --> 09:12.160
Well, we should
have that analysis done
by the end of day.

09:14.205 --> 09:15.859
What?

09:15.946 --> 09:17.905
We just got this back
from USAMRIID, sir.

09:17.992 --> 09:20.124
That box from the pond,
no Anthrax spores,

09:20.211 --> 09:21.430
and for good reason.

09:21.517 --> 09:23.737
That'’s a turtle trap.

09:23.824 --> 09:26.566
I also tracked down
Hatfill'’s medical records.

09:26.653 --> 09:29.220
The reason he was on Cipro
during the attack letters,

09:29.307 --> 09:32.615
he just had surgery
for a deviated septum.

09:32.702 --> 09:35.226
And your star witness
in the case, Tinkerbell
and her cohorts,

09:35.313 --> 09:38.621
they just got an innocent man
thrown in jail in California.

09:38.708 --> 09:41.929
Courts threw out
all their evidence.

09:42.016 --> 09:44.061
You are aware that
Rumsfeld just marched out

09:44.148 --> 09:47.064
in front of America based
on our information and

09:47.151 --> 09:50.241
pegged Hatfill as the guy.

09:53.767 --> 09:56.508
So you think the
person who did this was.

09:56.596 --> 09:58.728
- Ivins.
- Ivins.

10:02.253 --> 10:04.473
Does the science
back you up on any of this?

10:04.560 --> 10:06.344
Yes.

10:06.431 --> 10:07.737
We finally developed the
test that will distinguish one

10:07.824 --> 10:09.826
spore of Ames
strain from another.

10:09.913 --> 10:13.787
And Ivins'’ samples
came back a match to the
attack letters?

10:13.874 --> 10:15.440
Oh, no, but an expert
of his caliber should have

10:15.527 --> 10:17.791
more than just the four
samples he submitted.

10:17.878 --> 10:21.229
Look, if I can get the code
to the fridge in his labs,

10:21.316 --> 10:25.146
I am sure that we will
find a stash that he
hasn'’t told us about.

10:25.233 --> 10:29.759
I can'’t get a
warrant based on what you got.

10:29.846 --> 10:32.109
Not without a motive.

10:32.196 --> 10:34.503
You got a motive?

10:34.590 --> 10:37.637
I have one of
Bruce'’s friends who is
willing to wear a wire.

10:41.423 --> 10:43.033
They fired me.

10:43.120 --> 10:44.469
<i>MAN : Do you </i>
think it'’s related?

10:44.556 --> 10:45.906
Of
course it'’s related.

10:45.993 --> 10:48.343
The DOJ just happens
to yank the grant?

10:49.779 --> 10:51.389
You have got to be kidding.

10:51.476 --> 10:52.956
<i>MAN : </i>
What'’s happened?

10:53.043 --> 10:54.349
They'’re
making my life hell.

Choppers over my
place every morning,

10:55.916 --> 10:58.396
it'’s hounding my family.

10:58.483 --> 11:00.660
They can'’t get away with this.

11:00.747 --> 11:03.010
Look, I'’ve gotta
call you back.

and registration.

11:06.143 --> 11:07.362
How long have
you been following me?

11:07.449 --> 11:08.798
Excuse me?

11:08.885 --> 11:10.321
A little aggressive,
are we today?

11:10.408 --> 11:12.149
This is the
second ticket this week.

11:12.236 --> 11:13.934
Well, sir, you
were driving a little erratic.

11:14.021 --> 11:15.936
Have you had
anything to drink today?

11:16.023 --> 11:17.067
When am I gonna stop
for a beer when you guys tail

11:17.154 --> 11:19.156
me every second of the day?

11:19.243 --> 11:20.244
You know, it sounds
you'’ve got something weighing

11:20.331 --> 11:22.333
on your shoulders there, sir.

11:22.420 --> 11:25.206
A man'’s conscience can
be a hell of a thing.

11:28.296 --> 11:32.256
Have a nice day.

without anybody noticing?

13:31.680 --> 13:34.378
I'’m only doing this to
convince you he'’s innocent.

13:34.465 --> 13:37.077
You know, he'’s peculiar,
but I really don'’t think

13:37.164 --> 13:38.730
he'’s capable of
something like this.

13:38.818 --> 13:40.167
He wants
to impress you.

13:40.254 --> 13:41.908
So you just start
with the usual.

13:41.995 --> 13:45.128
You ask him about work,
about stress, projects.

13:45.215 --> 13:47.565
If his ego kicks in,
he might slip up and divulge a

13:47.652 --> 13:49.132
reason he could'’ve done this.

13:49.219 --> 13:50.568
Eyes on target.

13:50.655 --> 13:52.440
He'’s early.

13:56.923 --> 13:59.316
Yeah.

13:59.403 --> 14:00.840
You just
remember we'’re here.

14:00.927 --> 14:02.232
If you ever feel
threatened, you say,

14:02.319 --> 14:03.451
"I need to use the restroom."

14:03.538 --> 14:04.931
And we will be in.

14:25.299 --> 14:27.867
- Hi.
- Hi.

14:27.954 --> 14:31.087
It'’s good to see you.

14:31.174 --> 14:34.264
- Sit.
- Thanks.

14:34.351 --> 14:38.094
Sounds kind of stupid but I
was afraid you weren'’t gonna

14:38.181 --> 14:39.661
show for a minute there.

14:39.748 --> 14:43.447
Why wouldn'’t I show?

14:43.534 --> 14:44.927
So you must be
really busy at work.

14:45.014 --> 14:46.320
I haven'’t seen you.

14:46.407 --> 14:50.498
Yeah.
Really busy, I guess.

14:50.585 --> 14:56.547
<i>HALL : You know, </i>
with all the FBI around the
halls and stuff.

14:56.634 --> 14:58.854
Uh-huh.

14:58.941 --> 15:00.377
<i>HALL : What do you </i>
think about all that?

15:00.464 --> 15:03.163
Them looking around
all the time and stuff?

15:07.297 --> 15:10.126
You said stuff twice.

15:10.213 --> 15:13.477
I did? Sorry.

15:13.564 --> 15:18.613
Why would you
be sorry about stuff?

15:23.313 --> 15:25.489
Oh, Bruce,
you'’re such a jokester.

15:25.576 --> 15:29.493
That'’s me.
Excuse me.

15:29.580 --> 15:30.930
Can she order please?

15:31.017 --> 15:33.106
- Uh, just a coffee.
- Sure.

15:37.327 --> 15:40.591
I don'’t understand
why the FBI'’s hounding us.

15:40.678 --> 15:43.638
It'’s not like any of us could
refine Anthrax like that.

15:43.725 --> 15:45.596
Why would we?

15:48.121 --> 15:50.601
<i>IVINS : </i>
I missed you.

15:52.429 --> 15:55.563
Why did you
wanna meet me, Jody?

15:56.781 --> 16:00.176
It'’s not so odd, is it?

16:00.263 --> 16:02.700
Friends grabbing a coffee?

16:02.787 --> 16:04.528
It'’s just
when you called.

16:04.615 --> 16:06.313
Uh-huh.

16:06.400 --> 16:09.272
I was thinking,
"This is too good to be true."

16:14.495 --> 16:17.541
Good things don'’t happen
every day to Bruce Ivins.

16:17.628 --> 16:21.197
Well, maybe they should.

16:25.245 --> 16:29.553
Coulda,
woulda, shoulda.

16:29.640 --> 16:31.947
<i>IVINS : It'’s weird, </i>
you know, all I ever wanted to
do with my life

16:32.034 --> 16:34.384
<i>was help people.</i>

16:40.216 --> 16:43.480
Bruce, what'’s going on?

16:46.918 --> 16:49.225
I guess all of us
have two faces, Jody.

16:49.312 --> 16:52.098
Don'’t we?

16:59.235 --> 17:03.674
I'’m feeling a little tricky.
I think I have to go.

17:04.588 --> 17:07.330
Bruce.

17:21.605 --> 17:23.912
Damn it!

18:07.869 --> 18:10.219
<i>KATHRYN : Um, </i>
Steve is gonna ask each
of us to do something.

18:10.306 --> 18:12.308
<i>COOPER : </i>
The assignments
all quite dangerous.

18:12.395 --> 18:14.180
<i>You have to convince one of </i>
the players to stand against

18:14.267 --> 18:15.920
<i>the board and have a </i>
professional knife thrower

18:16.007 --> 18:18.967
<i>throw a knife at them.</i>

18:23.711 --> 18:26.714
<i>STEVE : Do you </i>
remember one of those stories
you told about Mr.

18:26.801 --> 18:28.933
<i>KATHRYN : Yes.</i>

18:29.020 --> 18:31.762
<i>STEVE : Okay. </i>
That'’s well.

18:31.849 --> 18:33.677
<i>KATHRYN : Okay. </i>
I can hear knives being
thrown in the background.

18:33.764 --> 18:35.592
<i>STEVE : Yeah.</i>

18:35.679 --> 18:37.507
<i>Would you do that for me?</i>

18:37.594 --> 18:40.075
<i>KATHRYN : I don'’t </i>
think I can do it.

18:40.162 --> 18:41.816
<i>STEVE : Well, </i>
listen, I chose you
specifically for this task.

18:41.903 --> 18:43.818
<i>KATHRYN : </i>
Why would you do that?

18:43.905 --> 18:45.994
<i>STEVE : Your fac is </i>
going a little red, okay?

18:46.081 --> 18:47.909
<i>What I'’m asking you to do is </i>
I just want you to stand very

18:47.996 --> 18:50.346
<i>still and he'’s gonna throw </i>
one at a time, okay?

18:50.433 --> 18:52.131
<i>Can you do that?</i>

18:52.218 --> 18:54.045
<i>He'’s gonna throw.</i>

18:54.133 --> 18:55.699
<i>KATHRYN : Why </i>
can'’t I see him throw?

18:55.786 --> 18:58.137
<i>STEVE : You </i>
can see him throw.

18:58.224 --> 18:59.747
<i>KATHRYN : </i>
How could your stupid aim
with that stupid

18:59.834 --> 19:02.228
<i>and you </i>
picked me for this?

19:02.315 --> 19:04.012
<i>STEVE : </i>
Well, I can'’t tell you
what the other ones are

19:04.099 --> 19:07.320
<i>but lean up against this. Okay?</i>

19:07.407 --> 19:09.626
<i>KATHRYN : </i>
I can'’t do this.

19:15.241 --> 19:18.461
This is everything of
interest we got from his trash.

19:18.548 --> 19:20.420
Bruce has been
drinking a lot more.

19:20.507 --> 19:22.117
It seems that he'’s mixing
it with his medication,

19:22.204 --> 19:24.989
like diazepam.

19:25.076 --> 19:27.253
- Valium?
- Uh-hmm.

19:31.257 --> 19:32.867
That'’s a
substantial dosage, too.

19:32.954 --> 19:34.477
Uh-hmm.

19:34.564 --> 19:36.697
That could be why
he passed the polygraph.

19:36.784 --> 19:40.048
This many
milligrams could mute
a body stress response.

19:41.005 --> 19:43.660
Check that out.

19:45.401 --> 19:47.925
The Linguistics of DNA?

19:48.012 --> 19:49.797
Yeah. So we never
did really get any traction
on the bold writing

19:49.884 --> 19:52.756
in the letters since some
were incinerated but I, uh...

19:52.843 --> 19:55.281
You think this could
be the source of the codex?

19:55.368 --> 19:57.848
I'’ve got a
cryptologist making headway.

19:57.935 --> 19:59.546
They think the bold
letters could be spelling out

19:59.633 --> 20:01.591
co-workers names.

20:01.678 --> 20:03.245
Got anything more
solid than just could be?

20:03.332 --> 20:05.552
Yeah, actually.

20:05.639 --> 20:07.989
I was, uh, scrolling through
one of the KKG Magazines
that Bruce had.

20:08.076 --> 20:10.165
Guess where they'’ve
got an office.

20:12.036 --> 20:13.821
Is that Nassau Street?

20:13.908 --> 20:14.822
Yeah, it'’s literally
right behind the mailbox

20:14.909 --> 20:17.085
that tested positive.

20:17.172 --> 20:20.958
That'’s not a
coincidence, right?

20:21.045 --> 20:23.178
Stalk sorority girls,
mail anthrax letters,

20:23.265 --> 20:24.745
why make two trips?

20:24.832 --> 20:26.660
I don'’t get this guy.

20:26.747 --> 20:28.401
He knows we'’re watching him
and yet he dumps telltale

20:28.488 --> 20:30.359
evidence in the trash.

20:30.446 --> 20:32.056
He shows up at the pond and
draws attention to himself.

20:36.539 --> 20:39.063
This is from
his hometown in Ohio.

20:42.632 --> 20:45.679
Have research pull up
the Gazette for that date.

20:45.766 --> 20:47.463
Find out what was so important
that it crossed state lines

20:47.550 --> 20:48.986
and then got clipped out.

20:49.073 --> 20:50.379
I know
you'’d ask for that.

20:50.466 --> 20:52.381
Here.

20:52.468 --> 20:53.687
It'’s a hometown-boy-does-good
article about Bruce getting

20:53.774 --> 20:56.385
the top DOJ civilian honor.

20:56.472 --> 21:00.302
"All I wanna
do is help people."

21:00.389 --> 21:02.696
He said that to Jody
when they were in the cafe.

21:05.481 --> 21:07.657
- Hey, Sheila.
- Hi.

21:07.744 --> 21:11.574
I need a favor.
It shouldn'’t take too long.

21:11.661 --> 21:18.407
So our subject Bruce Ivins
was really proud of his work
with anthrax vaccines.

21:18.494 --> 21:22.019
In fact, he got a medal for
his contributions but what

21:22.106 --> 21:25.284
I really can'’t tell is how much
of a stake he had in them.

21:25.371 --> 21:27.938
Contracts like these aren'’t
really my arena but you see

21:28.025 --> 21:29.853
them all the time.

21:31.681 --> 21:33.466
His name
is on the patent.

21:33.553 --> 21:35.424
What kind of a payday
are we talking about here?

21:35.511 --> 21:37.513
Could I get
the guy a nice vacation?

21:37.600 --> 21:39.080
Yeah.

21:39.167 --> 21:39.950
But to retire and put
his kids through college?

21:40.037 --> 21:41.648
No.

21:41.735 --> 21:43.345
So if it'’s
not about the money,

21:43.432 --> 21:44.694
this is about how Ivins
sees himself as a hero,

21:44.781 --> 21:47.175
as a patriot.

21:47.262 --> 21:50.700
You know, in his mind, he'’s
saving tens of thousands of

21:50.787 --> 21:53.877
lives by making people
beg to be vaccinated.

21:53.964 --> 21:56.184
What better way to kickstart
demand and put pressure on

21:56.271 --> 21:58.273
the FDA than throwing a
country into a panic and

21:58.360 --> 22:00.101
making us feel
like we need it?

22:00.188 --> 22:01.972
I mean, not just
the military but average moms

22:02.059 --> 22:05.541
checking the mail, everyone'’s
favorite news anchors.

22:08.457 --> 22:11.155
And I'’m not surprised that
you'’re the one that found him.

22:11.242 --> 22:13.070
I'’m just doing my job.

22:13.157 --> 22:15.986
You still don'’t
give yourself enough credit.

22:19.990 --> 22:21.992
Um, sorry.

22:22.079 --> 22:24.691
But you caught
me on my way out.

22:29.043 --> 22:31.654
I screwed
this up, didn'’t I?

22:39.053 --> 22:41.838
It was really nice
to see you again, Matthew.

22:44.711 --> 22:48.976
Sure.
Thanks for taking the time.

23:21.487 --> 23:24.098
Okay.

23:24.185 --> 23:27.536
How about we take a
seat and get started?

23:33.499 --> 23:35.979
What do you
want from me, Bruce?

23:39.243 --> 23:41.550
Guess.

23:41.637 --> 23:45.075
I want you to
stop being a coward.

23:45.162 --> 23:47.034
Say it again.

23:47.121 --> 23:49.515
There you go again,
blaming everyone else
for your problems.

23:49.602 --> 23:51.647
You'’re my dad.
You'’re supposed to protect me!

23:51.734 --> 23:54.171
From who?

23:54.258 --> 23:59.307
From who?
Did you really say from who?

23:59.394 --> 24:01.309
Okay. Let'’s talk about who.

24:01.396 --> 24:03.746
Hmm, let'’s see,
from the police,

24:03.833 --> 24:06.009
from the next door neighbor.

24:06.096 --> 24:08.534
You know exactly who.

24:08.621 --> 24:10.623
If you hadn'’t
have been so weak,

24:10.710 --> 24:12.973
maybe she wouldn'’t
have hit you so hard.

24:14.061 --> 24:15.976
What was it today, dad, huh?

24:16.063 --> 24:17.934
What was it?

24:18.021 --> 24:19.849
Did she, like, she grabbed the
broom and poke you in the eye

24:19.936 --> 24:21.372
with the broom again, huh?

24:21.460 --> 24:23.070
Bruce,
let'’s stop there.

24:23.157 --> 24:24.158
No, no, no,
no, I'’m not gonna stop.

24:24.245 --> 24:25.681
What was it today? Tell us.

24:25.768 --> 24:26.856
Just tell everybody
what was it today,

24:26.943 --> 24:28.771
what did she do?

24:28.858 --> 24:32.035
Did she stab you in the hand
with a fork because she caught

24:32.122 --> 24:35.082
you eating a
piece of pie, huh?

24:35.169 --> 24:36.779
It'’s true.

24:36.866 --> 24:38.085
You know what you are?
You'’re pathetic.

24:38.172 --> 24:40.391
You'’re a coward.
You'’re pathetic!

24:40.479 --> 24:42.132
Bruce, let'’s stop.
Let'’s stop there.

24:42.219 --> 24:43.917
You'’re pathetic!
You'’re not a father!

24:44.004 --> 24:45.875
You left me alone with her!
You left me alone!

24:45.962 --> 24:47.355
You were supposed to
be there for me!

24:47.442 --> 24:49.183
That'’s enough.

24:49.270 --> 24:51.011
You know what I would,
you know what I would.

24:51.098 --> 24:52.665
Bruce! You need
to get control of yourself!

24:52.752 --> 24:53.883
Fine.
You'’re a disgrace!

24:53.970 --> 24:56.538
Take a break!

25:01.587 --> 25:02.936
What are
you all looking at?

25:03.023 --> 25:05.808
Bruce, we
are here for you.

25:05.895 --> 25:07.506
I don'’t laugh at you
and listen to her story about
her mother for how many times.

25:07.593 --> 25:09.072
No one'’s
attacking you. Bruce. Bruce.

25:09.159 --> 25:10.639
- This is ridiculous.
- Please.

25:10.726 --> 25:12.467
You know what?
Screw all of you.

25:12.554 --> 25:14.251
Screw all of you,
I don'’t care. I don'’t care.

25:14.338 --> 25:15.339
You'’re just like
everyone at the base.

25:15.426 --> 25:17.254
Liars and spies.

25:17.341 --> 25:19.300
I'’ll tell you one thing,
those phonies at USAMRIID,

25:19.387 --> 25:20.736
they'’re gonna regret it,
they think they'’re impervious,

25:20.823 --> 25:22.259
all buddy-buddy with the FBI.

25:22.346 --> 25:24.784
We'’ll see how
bulletproof they are.

26:04.693 --> 26:07.827
- Bruce?
- Jody. Jody.

26:09.219 --> 26:10.351
Sir.

26:10.438 --> 26:11.395
Sir, we need you
to come with us.

26:11.482 --> 26:13.093
What'’s this about?

26:13.180 --> 26:14.442
You'’re
being detained, sir.

26:14.529 --> 26:16.139
For psychiatric evaluation.

26:16.226 --> 26:18.489
I'’m not going with you.

26:18.577 --> 26:21.449
It'’s
involuntary, sir.

26:21.536 --> 26:23.407
We need to see your hands.

26:23.494 --> 26:26.541
Show us your hands.

26:26.628 --> 26:28.935
Is this about the FBI?

26:29.022 --> 26:32.199
Are you guys all in
cahoots with them?

26:32.286 --> 26:37.073
I mean, Addie I'’d
figured but Simon and Jody?

26:37.160 --> 26:39.293
No, Bruce.

26:39.380 --> 26:42.426
But the police told me that
you threatened everyone here.

26:42.513 --> 26:46.866
Who said that?
Dr. Halstrom?

26:46.953 --> 26:48.171
Is it true?

26:48.258 --> 26:49.216
Don'’t look
at me like that.

26:49.303 --> 26:51.522
Ow! Ow, ow, ow!

26:51.610 --> 26:52.480
Okay.

26:52.567 --> 26:54.351
Let me go!

26:54.438 --> 26:55.875
Well, that'’s great.
Everybody knows now?

26:55.962 --> 26:59.008
Okay, super.
Poor Bruce goes to therapy.

26:59.095 --> 27:01.794
Has to take pills
to feel normal.

27:01.881 --> 27:03.970
It'’s not like I was
gonna hurt anyone!

27:04.057 --> 27:05.841
Let go of me!

27:05.928 --> 27:08.365
I work here!

27:35.479 --> 27:39.092
I am here to
confirm my innocence in
the anthrax attacks.

27:39.179 --> 27:41.834
I'’ve been berated and
victimized in endless leaks

27:41.921 --> 27:45.011
and general implications
from the United States
Attorney General,

27:45.098 --> 27:47.883
the FBI, and the media.

27:47.970 --> 27:51.234
<i>HATFILL : </i>
I don'’t know anything
about the anthrax attacks.

27:51.321 --> 27:52.192
You wanted to see me?

27:52.279 --> 27:54.585
Close the door.

27:54.673 --> 27:56.718
<i>HATFILL : </i>
I am absolutely not
the anthrax killer.

27:56.805 --> 27:59.590
<i>My life is being destroyed by </i>
government officials who are

27:59.678 --> 28:03.507
<i>pushing baseless claims </i>
and half truths about me to

28:03.594 --> 28:04.683
<i>desperate reporters.</i>

28:04.770 --> 28:07.250
I got your warrant.

28:07.337 --> 28:09.252
<i>HATFILL : Who then </i>
broadcast this information wide
without any hesitation.

28:09.339 --> 28:11.472
I'’ll have a team at
Ivins'’s house this afternoon

28:11.559 --> 28:14.301
and I will personally
search his labs.

28:14.388 --> 28:17.957
It'’s like watching
Richard Jewell all over again.

28:18.044 --> 28:22.222
That is not a guilty man and the
American public can see it.

28:22.309 --> 28:23.745
Well, by the time they
realize we'’ve been hounding

28:23.832 --> 28:26.226
the wrong guy, I promise you,

28:26.313 --> 28:28.445
we will have the real
culprit in custody.

28:28.532 --> 28:30.360
<i>HATFILL : It is </i>
one thing to have your
alleged faults and

28:30.447 --> 28:32.145
<i>mistakes publicly </i>
aired because you are...

28:32.232 --> 28:34.713
Ivins
better be the guy.

28:34.800 --> 28:37.367
<i>HATFILL : But I am a </i>
private American citizen.

28:37.454 --> 28:41.415
I'’ll handle
Director Mueller.

28:41.502 --> 28:43.156
Everything is riding on you.

28:43.243 --> 28:45.158
I know, sir.

28:47.290 --> 28:49.379
Agent Ryker.

28:49.466 --> 28:52.774
We don'’t need
just a smoking gun.

28:52.861 --> 28:54.820
We need the bullet.

28:57.910 --> 28:59.694
<i>HATFILL : Under </i>
the Patriot Act.

29:21.542 --> 29:22.499
Come on,
everybody sing.

29:22.586 --> 29:24.980
You guys know these words.

29:37.079 --> 29:39.212
That was so good!

29:39.299 --> 29:40.256
That was so fun.

29:40.343 --> 29:41.736
All right.

29:41.823 --> 29:44.478
Here'’s another one.
You ready?

29:56.838 --> 29:58.187
What'’s going on?

29:58.274 --> 30:00.146
How does he
know that song?

30:00.233 --> 30:01.408
That'’s not cool,
that'’s supposed to be a secret.

30:01.495 --> 30:02.801
Why?

30:02.888 --> 30:04.237
You'’re not one of us.

30:04.324 --> 30:05.194
Minnie, Jenny,
Lou, and then.

30:05.281 --> 30:06.543
Stop it!

30:06.630 --> 30:08.328
Come on, stop
playing that song.

30:08.415 --> 30:11.548
You hoard
behind your face.

30:11.635 --> 30:12.506
What are you.

30:12.593 --> 30:13.376
Look at you.

30:13.463 --> 30:17.380
A total disgrace.

30:17.467 --> 30:19.687
Bruce, you'’re
such a jokester.

30:19.774 --> 30:21.602
That'’s me.

30:23.082 --> 30:24.997
FBI?

30:25.084 --> 30:27.042
The police told me that
you threatened everyone here.

30:27.129 --> 30:29.740
Who said that?
Dr. Halstrom?

30:31.394 --> 30:33.570
Are you guys all in
cahoots with them?

30:33.657 --> 30:34.963
I mean, Addie I'’d figured.

30:35.050 --> 30:37.705
Boom.

30:37.792 --> 30:39.881
I work here!

30:51.588 --> 30:53.068
Greendale.

30:53.155 --> 30:54.678
Like the return
address from the letters?

30:54.765 --> 30:56.637
It'’s from
before the attacks.

30:56.724 --> 31:00.206
It'’s about a fourth-grade
class at a Greendale School.

31:00.293 --> 31:02.556
Well, I would take
those odds to Vegas.

31:02.643 --> 31:04.166
Guys, I need you to
photograph this right here and

31:04.253 --> 31:06.212
then bag it for evidence.

31:06.299 --> 31:08.170
You think the
family'’s got any idea?

31:08.257 --> 31:10.781
No. Wife and
kids are still being
questioned at the motel.

31:10.869 --> 31:12.871
Some genius interrogator
dangled that million-dollar

31:12.958 --> 31:14.873
reward but they stood firm.

31:14.960 --> 31:18.702
They say that Bruce is a
loving father and a husband.

31:18.789 --> 31:21.270
Not a killer.

31:21.357 --> 31:24.186
Toretti, Moore,
you should see this.

31:32.368 --> 31:35.458
It'’s a
one-man arsenal.

31:59.134 --> 32:01.789
Chris.
Check this out.

32:12.147 --> 32:16.021
And to think all
this was brewing under
that pencil mustache.

32:16.108 --> 32:19.546
One
disturbed individual.

32:25.856 --> 32:28.642
- Chris!
- Yeah?

32:28.729 --> 32:32.124
Look at this.

32:32.211 --> 32:35.475
He'’s written his own list of
why he might be a suspect.

32:35.562 --> 32:37.564
"Political reasons
made me do it.

32:37.651 --> 32:40.741
Get Patriot Act and
other legislation passed.

32:40.828 --> 32:42.525
Financial reasons
made me do it,

32:42.612 --> 32:46.703
make money off new vaccine."

32:46.790 --> 32:49.228
He'’s trying to get in our
heads so he can figure out

32:49.315 --> 32:51.970
what we'’re seeing in his.

32:54.059 --> 32:56.844
Every sample Bruce
has is in that fridge.

33:45.849 --> 33:48.896
There'’s gotta be over
40 anthrax slants in here.

33:48.983 --> 33:51.029
How many
did he submit?

33:52.639 --> 33:54.945
Four.

34:01.300 --> 34:05.217
Why didn'’t you submit
everything you had?

34:05.304 --> 34:07.262
Is that what'’s
gonna do me in?

34:07.349 --> 34:09.786
You tell me.

34:11.614 --> 34:13.529
I could try to
blabber out some excuse,

34:13.616 --> 34:18.534
but I'’m afraid my memory'’s
a little foggy these days.

34:18.621 --> 34:21.363
Okay.
Well, let me help you.

34:23.148 --> 34:28.022
Thomas Morris, Joseph Curseen,
Ottie Lundgren.

34:29.937 --> 34:33.984
Kathy Nguyen.
Robert Stevens.

34:36.683 --> 34:40.817
All innocent. All dead.

34:40.904 --> 34:43.907
They all deserve justice.

34:43.994 --> 34:46.040
And I'’m gonna get it for them.

34:46.127 --> 34:48.521
I'’m sorry.

34:48.608 --> 34:51.393
I don'’t recall anything.

34:51.480 --> 34:54.962
Nothing. Nada.

34:59.749 --> 35:02.665
Thank you
for your time.

35:07.061 --> 35:09.585
Do you sleep much?

35:12.849 --> 35:15.852
Rarely. You?

35:15.939 --> 35:19.029
Not without
a little help.

35:19.117 --> 35:23.121
Look, I know it doesn'’t
matter if I did it or not,

35:23.208 --> 35:26.428
you got a bunch of
little pieces, I guess.

35:26.515 --> 35:29.344
But what'’s the motive?

35:30.389 --> 35:33.870
- Vaccines.
- Oh.

35:33.957 --> 35:39.702
Well, a little evil for
the greater good, huh?

35:39.789 --> 35:44.142
So what, domestic terrorism?

35:44.229 --> 35:46.579
Capital murder?

35:46.666 --> 35:48.885
Five counts.

35:48.972 --> 35:50.626
At a time when the
country'’s under attack,

35:50.713 --> 35:53.455
feeling vulnerable,
prosecution will push for

35:53.542 --> 35:55.849
the death penalty.

35:55.936 --> 36:01.550
Well, if I did it,
I guess I'’d deserve that.

36:01.637 --> 36:04.074
Well, I'’m sure
the jury will think so.

36:07.643 --> 36:12.082
Do you ever experience
euphoria, Agent Ryker?

36:12.170 --> 36:16.086
Well, if I have,
uh, it'’s been a long time.

36:16.174 --> 36:18.698
I feel that way a lot.

36:18.785 --> 36:21.179
And that'’s the way you
live your life, right?

36:21.266 --> 36:24.356
No real lows, no real highs,
just right there in the middle.

36:24.443 --> 36:27.359
You mean in control?

36:27.446 --> 36:31.841
You, convincing
yourself you'’re in control,

36:31.928 --> 36:36.150
how lucky to be so delusional.

36:36.237 --> 36:39.414
The poster child of
fortuitous living.

36:40.285 --> 36:42.635
Fortuitous?

36:52.166 --> 36:55.213
You know, I was in a
car on that stretch of
Washington Boulevard,

36:55.300 --> 37:00.609
right by the Pentagon when
Flight 77 came over.

37:00.696 --> 37:03.003
- You saw it happen?
- Uh-hmm.

37:03.090 --> 37:06.572
- All that devastation?
- You would think.

37:06.659 --> 37:09.923
But right around
the crash site,

37:10.010 --> 37:12.055
the grass was perfect.

37:12.142 --> 37:16.495
No one was running out of
the building screaming.

37:16.582 --> 37:22.240
The impact was so intense that
the plane exploded inward and

37:22.327 --> 37:28.333
practically disintegrated,
taking the building and all the,

37:29.725 --> 37:32.162
all those people with it.

37:34.469 --> 37:39.735
It felt, uh...

37:39.822 --> 37:42.521
it was pure terror.

37:44.566 --> 37:48.614
But, uh, all the debris,
and all the fallout,

37:48.701 --> 37:52.357
was forced inside.

37:55.229 --> 37:57.275
Buried.

38:06.588 --> 38:09.504
I take it I'’m
the imploding building?

38:13.595 --> 38:16.555
Well, you'’re never
gonna see what'’s inside.

38:22.169 --> 38:25.041
I'’ve been trying
my whole life.

38:29.698 --> 38:31.831
- He wrote this?
- Uh-hmm.

38:31.918 --> 38:34.486
- It'’s promising.
- Promising?

38:34.573 --> 38:37.706
The guy'’s been lying about how
many variants of Ames he had.

38:37.793 --> 38:40.361
Including one
that matches the attack
letters exactly.

38:40.448 --> 38:42.102
RMR-1029.

38:42.189 --> 38:43.886
Got it.

38:43.973 --> 38:45.627
Albeit slim there'’s
always a chance that someone

38:45.714 --> 38:47.760
infiltrated the lab
and stole Ivins'’s stash.

38:47.847 --> 38:49.675
Do you really think
that someone just tiptoed in

38:49.762 --> 38:52.504
off the street, suited up, got
themselves past security at an

38:52.591 --> 38:55.245
army base and then
found themselves at
a bio safety suite?

38:55.333 --> 38:57.465
Look, for this to
hold water with a grand jury,

38:57.552 --> 38:59.685
there can be no other person
who could have touched it.

38:59.772 --> 39:01.643
It'’s next to
impossible to prove.

39:01.730 --> 39:04.342
Everyone at USAMRIID
who could have gained access

39:04.429 --> 39:06.518
to this fridge was vetted.

39:06.605 --> 39:09.347
Rita, it took me a
while to see Agent Ryker was

39:09.434 --> 39:10.913
on the right track, too.

39:11.000 --> 39:15.788
This guy, Ivins, is guilty.

39:15.875 --> 39:20.096
Ivins originally
submitted the vial of
anthrax on the right,

39:20.183 --> 39:21.968
but he sent it
in the wrong slant and so it

39:22.055 --> 39:25.058
should have been discarded,
and then he resubmitted.

39:25.145 --> 39:26.625
There'’s a second
submission on the left?

39:26.712 --> 39:28.627
Yes, it
tested negative,

39:28.714 --> 39:30.846
but it turns out the lab
kept that first sample,

39:30.933 --> 39:33.240
had it all this time.

39:33.327 --> 39:36.025
We tested it and
it was an exact match
to the attack letters.

39:36.112 --> 39:38.463
Just like the mother
batch we found in his fridge.

39:38.550 --> 39:40.987
You'’re saying
Ivins switched the spores
the second time?

39:41.074 --> 39:43.163
We think he realized he
could become a suspect and

39:43.250 --> 39:45.034
he started covering his tracks.

39:45.121 --> 39:47.472
He also tried to
blame that original submission

39:47.559 --> 39:50.126
on his assistant, but you can
see by the handwriting on both

39:50.213 --> 39:52.302
those slants it'’s
the same person.

39:52.390 --> 39:56.219
It is Bruce Ivins.

39:56.306 --> 39:59.527
And that'’s
clear intent to deceive.

39:59.614 --> 40:01.747
We need an
arrest warrant.

40:01.834 --> 40:04.184
Bureau needs to put
this thing to bed.

40:04.271 --> 40:07.056
This
should get us one.

40:07.143 --> 40:09.972
By tomorrow.

40:14.150 --> 40:17.023
Agent Toretti, nice work.

40:19.417 --> 40:23.421
Huh. You got your guy.
Congratulations.

40:31.516 --> 40:35.520
I'’ve been, I'’ve been,
I'’ve been drinking quite a lot

40:35.607 --> 40:39.393
and I guess mixed
with my medications,

40:39.480 --> 40:42.178
I hadn'’t realized how
disconnected I'’ve become.

40:42.265 --> 40:43.876
That can happen when
one'’s reality is displaced

40:43.963 --> 40:45.312
with substances.

40:45.399 --> 40:47.009
Yeah.

40:47.096 --> 40:49.708
I really want
ongoing treatment,

40:49.795 --> 40:53.102
but I miss my family.

40:53.189 --> 40:57.411
Shoot, I just wanna
hold them in my arms,

40:57.498 --> 41:00.458
tell them I'’m okay.

41:08.378 --> 41:10.424
This is
Dr. Halstrom speaking.

41:10.511 --> 41:12.687
<i>IVINS : Listen </i>
to you, so perky.

41:12.774 --> 41:14.776
Bruce?

41:14.863 --> 41:16.386
I'’ve been sitting
here thinking and I realized,

41:16.474 --> 41:18.650
all those notes
you'’ve been taking,

41:18.737 --> 41:20.390
<i>IVINS : You showed </i>
them everything, didn'’t you?

41:20.478 --> 41:22.654
No,
I haven'’t, Bruce.

41:22.741 --> 41:25.265
I was concerned for your
safety and those around you.

41:25.352 --> 41:29.574
Those who betray
us will pay for their
injustices dearly, my dear.

41:29.661 --> 41:31.401
<i>HALSTROM : Bruce, </i>
what are you talking about?

41:31.489 --> 41:34.187
Never dally,
my mother said.

41:34.274 --> 41:37.886
She taught me that
being prompt is a virtue.

41:37.973 --> 41:39.714
I'’ll see you soon,
Dr. Halstrom.

41:54.816 --> 41:56.601
Got it.

41:56.688 --> 41:58.472
They let Ivins out
of the psych ward.

41:58.559 --> 41:59.647
What?

41:59.734 --> 42:00.822
He called
his therapist,

42:00.909 --> 42:01.910
threatened to go after her.

42:01.997 --> 42:03.172
I'’m heading over there.

42:03.259 --> 42:05.000
I'’m coming with you.

42:05.087 --> 42:05.827
Get a cop car over
to his house just in case he

42:05.914 --> 42:07.089
shows up there.

42:07.176 --> 42:08.047
And alert the MPs
over at USAMRIID.

42:08.134 --> 42:09.527
Okay.

42:09.614 --> 42:10.658
You think he might
be going after Jody?

42:10.745 --> 42:11.877
He could
go after anyone.

42:11.964 --> 42:13.966
He knows we'’re coming for him.

43:20.423 --> 43:22.425
Bruce,
I'’m hurt, I'’m concerned.

43:22.512 --> 43:23.905
You tell me you love me but...

43:23.992 --> 43:25.864
Over your actions the
last few weeks...

43:25.951 --> 43:29.258
Jumpy and agitated...

43:32.697 --> 43:35.482
Can you honestly say
you'’re following the
plan you developed?

43:35.569 --> 43:38.224
Can you honestly say
you'’re following the
plan you developed?

43:54.414 --> 43:56.938
I have never
encountered a mind like his.

43:57.025 --> 44:00.768
I truly cannot get a handle on
what his real intentions were.

44:00.855 --> 44:03.597
We had no idea he was
on so many anti-psychotics.

44:03.684 --> 44:05.381
Mental
illness ran in his family.

44:05.468 --> 44:07.166
What exactly
were you treating him for?

44:07.253 --> 44:10.648
Paranoia, anxiety,
potential schizophrenia,

44:10.735 --> 44:12.562
episodes of memory loss.

44:12.650 --> 44:14.390
He'’d been blacking out?

44:14.477 --> 44:16.131
Sometimes he'’d
have lost hours at a time,

44:16.218 --> 44:17.872
regain cognition
with car keys in hand,

44:17.959 --> 44:20.527
see he'’d driven hundreds
of miles on his odometer.

44:20.614 --> 44:22.398
That'’s enough time to
make it to Princeton and back.

44:22.485 --> 44:23.704
Maybe not even know it.

44:23.791 --> 44:26.402
The man
struggles deeply.

44:26.489 --> 44:29.405
But you always try to see the
version of the person you can

44:29.492 --> 44:32.321
connect with,
offer the most to.

44:32.408 --> 44:34.062
So Moore says
he'’s not at USAMRIID,

44:34.149 --> 44:37.805
Reilly is with Jody, the
cops just got to his home,

44:37.892 --> 44:39.285
there are lights on.

44:39.372 --> 44:41.461
He went home?
Good.

44:41.548 --> 44:45.117
Doctor, do you
think Bruce poses any
danger to himself?

44:57.782 --> 45:00.088
Why do we have to
leave the dance so early?

45:00.175 --> 45:02.482
No one else will
be here for hours.

45:02.569 --> 45:04.571
Mother insisted.

45:07.487 --> 45:09.358
If I would have known
that we'’d miss all of prom.

45:09.445 --> 45:11.404
I'’m sorry.

45:11.491 --> 45:14.537
I really wanted to stay.

45:20.935 --> 45:24.243
I just need
to powder my nose.

45:29.335 --> 45:32.338
Dear.

45:32.425 --> 45:35.602
I just wanted one normal
day of high school, mother.

45:35.689 --> 45:37.560
Honestly, Bruce,
a girl like that.

45:37.647 --> 45:39.432
She'’s really nice.

45:39.519 --> 45:42.522
Oh, that is what
she wants you to believe.

45:42.609 --> 45:46.221
Mother, not everyone
is as bad as you think.

45:48.049 --> 45:50.312
Do you see her
over there, Bruce?

45:50.399 --> 45:53.533
She'’s making fun
of you right now.

45:58.581 --> 46:01.019
Why did you
have to ruin this?

46:03.108 --> 46:05.240
You listen to me.

46:05.327 --> 46:11.290
I am the only one in
this world who will
protect you, okay?

46:12.204 --> 46:14.554
Okay.

46:16.599 --> 46:19.602
Darling, you need to
learn to accept that people

46:19.689 --> 46:24.346
may only ever see a
very tiny piece of you

46:24.433 --> 46:28.394
and never understand all the
good that you'’ve done for them,

46:28.481 --> 46:32.050
even when you try to
protect those that are weak.

46:32.137 --> 46:36.271
People like your father,
they won'’t appreciate you.

46:36.358 --> 46:39.274
But we are still
there for them,

46:39.361 --> 46:44.584
helping them anyway
because that is who we are.

47:00.339 --> 47:02.602
My beautiful boy.

47:12.090 --> 47:13.656
He'’s not picking up.

47:13.743 --> 47:15.920
It'’s happening again.

47:16.007 --> 47:19.227
What are
you talking about?

47:19.314 --> 47:20.707
If we
don'’t get an arrest,

47:20.794 --> 47:23.579
there'’s no one to
hold accountable.

47:23.666 --> 47:26.539
There'’s no justice
for the victims.

47:29.977 --> 47:33.154
It'’s just like the Pentagon.

47:33.241 --> 47:36.549
You stopped him.

47:36.636 --> 47:40.074
Whatever happens, nobody
is gonna get hurt again.

47:45.166 --> 47:47.690
Damn it.

48:34.389 --> 48:37.001
