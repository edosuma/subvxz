WEBVTT

00:02.203 --> 00:03.771
<i>That's how
she's gonna prove
to the world</i>

00:03.904 --> 00:05.439
<i>that she's seizing control
of his empire.</i>

00:07.708 --> 00:09.177
<i>She's gonna kill him.</i>

00:09.310 --> 00:10.511
<i>She's making a mistake.</i>

00:11.712 --> 00:12.646
<i>I need to stop her!</i>

00:13.547 --> 00:14.515
<i>This won't end well.</i>

00:26.927 --> 00:28.162
I can't do it.

00:29.163 --> 00:30.464
That's all right.

00:32.866 --> 00:33.734
I don't want to.

00:36.970 --> 00:38.172
I understand.

00:44.878 --> 00:47.148
No. No!

00:53.621 --> 00:56.357
Raymond, we must.
I'm sorry.

01:08.001 --> 01:09.770
No!

01:09.903 --> 01:11.139
Stop! Stop!

01:11.272 --> 01:12.573
Stop. I'm an FBI agent.

01:12.706 --> 01:14.342
I'm in pursuit
of a murder suspect.

01:14.475 --> 01:16.076
Get out of your car!
I need your car!
Really?

01:16.210 --> 01:17.345
Come on!
Get out of the car!

01:20.281 --> 01:22.783
Call the police!
He just hijacked my car!

01:37.665 --> 01:38.932
We have company.

01:40.168 --> 01:40.901
It's Ressler.

01:44.205 --> 01:45.206
Lose him.

01:57.418 --> 01:58.652
He killed her!

01:58.786 --> 02:00.388
<i>I know what you wanna do.</i>

02:00.521 --> 02:01.755
He may not have
pulled the trigger.

02:01.889 --> 02:03.391
But she's dead
because of him.

02:03.524 --> 02:06.227
<i>Yes, probably, but killing him
will only make it worse.</i>

02:06.960 --> 02:08.329
<i>Donald, listen to me.</i>

02:08.462 --> 02:09.630
<i>You're in no condition
to drive.</i>

02:10.198 --> 02:11.399
<i>Don't do this.</i>

02:39.493 --> 02:40.494
Hey.

02:43.931 --> 02:45.599
Hard to believe
it's been two years.

02:45.733 --> 02:47.134
Feels like 200.

02:47.268 --> 02:48.269
How's Agnes holding up?

02:49.503 --> 02:51.171
Amazingly well.

02:51.305 --> 02:53.441
She wants the anniversary
to be a celebration

02:53.574 --> 02:55.976
of Elizabeth's life,
not a mourning of her death.

02:56.109 --> 02:58.011
So that's what
we're doing tonight.

02:59.480 --> 03:00.514
You're welcome to join us.

03:01.515 --> 03:03.183
Oh, I appreciate that,
but I, uh,

03:03.317 --> 03:05.018
just came in to see if I
could get the morning off.

03:06.654 --> 03:08.522
Take the day. I insist.

03:08.656 --> 03:09.757
Thank you.

03:09.890 --> 03:11.525
We've been going through
photo albums recently

03:11.659 --> 03:12.626
and found this.

03:14.528 --> 03:16.464
Agnes wanted you to have it.

03:19.567 --> 03:20.634
I'm around if you need me.

03:33.180 --> 03:35.015
Shortness of breath.
Decreased breath sounds.

03:35.148 --> 03:37.818
Tracheal deviation. I think
it's a tension pneumothorax.

03:37.951 --> 03:39.987
And it looks like the area's
already been damaged.

03:40.120 --> 03:42.189
We need to do
a needle decompression.

03:57.971 --> 03:59.873
BP is 80 and dropping.
Heart rate is 120.

04:00.007 --> 04:01.509
Oxygen saturation is low.

04:01.642 --> 04:02.676
Put him on a non-rebreather.

04:04.077 --> 04:05.713
His lung is putting pressure
on his heart.

04:05.846 --> 04:08.416
He needs a chest tube now!
Let's go, people!

04:08.549 --> 04:10.884
I understand.
I know the driver of the car
he hit is in surgery

04:11.018 --> 04:12.420
and you need
to talk to him.

04:12.553 --> 04:14.522
But he's my agent.
He's hurt.

04:14.655 --> 04:15.789
And I don't appreciate
you going in there

04:15.923 --> 04:17.758
and cuffing him like
he's a common criminal.

04:21.629 --> 04:22.896
You're surprisingly popular.

04:24.332 --> 04:25.699
How's the woman I hit?

04:25.833 --> 04:27.635
Better. Healing.

04:27.768 --> 04:29.570
In time she should be fine.

04:29.703 --> 04:32.540
"Should be." And this?

04:32.673 --> 04:34.775
Am I free, or is this
a stay of execution?

04:34.908 --> 04:36.410
That depends
on the outcome

04:36.544 --> 04:38.712
of the Bureau's disciplinary
committee hearing.

04:38.846 --> 04:40.348
They're holding it
as soon as you get out.

04:40.481 --> 04:42.282
What they decide will go
a long way in determining

04:42.416 --> 04:44.585
whether the D.A.
files charges or not.

04:44.718 --> 04:46.487
Do they know I was in pursuit?

04:46.620 --> 04:49.790
They do.
And that you were DUI.

04:51.759 --> 04:53.126
Reddington. Where is he?

04:53.260 --> 04:54.762
Gone.

04:54.895 --> 04:57.598
Disappeared without a trace.
His lines are dead.

04:57.731 --> 04:59.299
All major law-enforcement
agencies

04:59.433 --> 05:00.434
have been alerted,

05:00.568 --> 05:01.769
and nothing's come back.

05:01.902 --> 05:03.437
It's only a matter of time
before his immunity agreement

05:03.571 --> 05:05.939
is revoked
and the task force disbanded.

05:06.073 --> 05:08.108
Good. Then we can start
hunting him again.

05:10.043 --> 05:12.380
Elizabeth had a will.

05:12.513 --> 05:15.549
She designated me and Charlene
as Agnes' legal guardians.

05:17.718 --> 05:19.953
I think she'd want us
to look forward, not back.

05:22.289 --> 05:23.591
I'm gonna try to do that.

05:25.058 --> 05:26.760
My hope is you can, too.

05:36.036 --> 05:37.605
I've put in
your discharge papers.

05:37.738 --> 05:41.174
Your job now
is to rest and do PT.

05:41.308 --> 05:43.444
I'll see you in my office
in a week.

05:43.577 --> 05:46.179
In the meantime,
I want to talk with you
about pain management.

05:46.313 --> 05:49.116
Oh, I'm good.
I know from your chart

05:49.249 --> 05:51.251
that you had
a dependency issue
in the past.

05:52.219 --> 05:53.487
I was an addict, yes.

05:53.621 --> 05:55.088
But, uh, I don't plan
on being one again.

05:55.222 --> 05:56.890
And we'll do whatever
we can to help you.

05:57.024 --> 05:58.325
But you're going to be
in pain for a while.

05:58.459 --> 06:00.193
I'm fine.

06:00.327 --> 06:03.130
Taking what I'm offering,
the pills and the advice,

06:03.263 --> 06:05.499
is better
than the alternative,
which is to wait

06:05.633 --> 06:07.801
until in your suffering
you find yourself
on the street

06:07.935 --> 06:09.069
looking to buy
whatever you can.

06:13.340 --> 06:14.608
You don't wanna
give me those.

06:15.308 --> 06:17.144
No, I don't.

06:17.277 --> 06:18.812
But I can't let you walk
out of here without them.

06:20.313 --> 06:22.215
Do you have someone
who can help you manage this?

06:22.349 --> 06:23.584
Sure. Tons of people.

06:23.717 --> 06:25.686
I'm prescribing oxycodone.

06:35.162 --> 06:37.030
I just
got off the phone
with Rebecca Hagens,

06:37.164 --> 06:38.632
head of the FBI
disciplinary committee.

06:38.766 --> 06:40.534
She's been sitting
at your hearing
for a half-hour.

06:40.668 --> 06:42.302
She says you haven't
shown up.

06:42.436 --> 06:43.937
<i>I encouraged her to give you
the benefit of the doubt</i>

06:44.071 --> 06:45.338
<i>after everything you've done
for your country</i>

06:45.473 --> 06:46.640
<i>and allow
for a little more time,</i>

06:46.774 --> 06:47.741
<i>but I can only do so much.</i>

06:48.375 --> 06:49.376
Where are you?

06:49.510 --> 06:50.377
I'm looking forward,
not back.

06:50.511 --> 06:51.945
Five minutes away? Ten?

06:52.079 --> 06:53.681
<i>You said this is what
Keen would want.</i>

06:53.814 --> 06:57.250
What she'd want is
for you to look forward
to clearing your name.

06:57.384 --> 06:59.019
<i>Which you can still do
if you can get there
soon enough.</i>

06:59.152 --> 07:01.021
I'm not going.
<i>Donald.</i>

07:01.154 --> 07:02.790
They'll take your badge.
<i>They can have it.</i>

07:02.923 --> 07:05.425
<i>I left it at my apartment,
along with my service weapon.</i>

07:05.559 --> 07:07.194
So that's it? You're done?

07:07.327 --> 07:08.328
Yeah, I am.

07:10.531 --> 07:13.066
Look, if I stay,
I'll hunt for him.

07:13.200 --> 07:15.368
I'll become obsessed
with him and her.

07:15.503 --> 07:17.104
You've worked too hard
to let it end this way.

07:18.105 --> 07:19.640
Yeah, I have.

07:19.773 --> 07:21.709
<i>Donald, we can help you
get through this.</i>

07:21.842 --> 07:25.212
We can help each other.
We're all struggling.

07:25.345 --> 07:26.647
<i>We need to be here
for each other.</i>

07:26.780 --> 07:28.616
I know. I'm sorry.

07:50.538 --> 07:52.706
Hey, buddy.
You gettin' on?

07:55.008 --> 07:56.276
I don't got all day.

08:10.057 --> 08:12.760
Hi, there.
Take a seat.

08:21.268 --> 08:24.504
So what are we doin' today?
A trim? Clean it up?

08:24.638 --> 08:26.473
Take it off.
You sure?

08:26.607 --> 08:28.542
Looks like you've been
growing it a while.

08:28.676 --> 08:30.110
It's a real statement
if you ask me.

08:30.243 --> 08:32.112
Trust me. It's time.

08:49.062 --> 08:51.464
Hey.
Welcome to Liberty Falls.

08:51.599 --> 08:54.301
Yeah, thanks. It seems like
a nice little town.

08:54.434 --> 08:57.537
Well, it's
definitely... little.

08:57.671 --> 08:59.372
Room for tonight?
That should work. Yeah.

08:59.506 --> 09:01.474
Mom!
The craziest thing
just happened!

09:01.609 --> 09:03.210
Honey.
I'm helping someone.

09:03.343 --> 09:06.279
Captain Hook
just captured Wendy
and the other Lost Boys!

09:06.413 --> 09:08.515
And he took them
to the pirate ship.

09:08.649 --> 09:10.718
But Peter Pan's asleep,
so he doesn't know!

09:10.851 --> 09:11.852
And they're gonna poison...

09:11.985 --> 09:13.621
Theodore!
I said not now.

09:13.754 --> 09:15.322
You're gonna
wanna hear this.
I know.

09:15.455 --> 09:17.758
And I will.
In a minute. Okay?

09:17.891 --> 09:20.193
Geez. Fine.

09:20.327 --> 09:22.529
I'm sorry. He has
a very active imagination.

09:22.663 --> 09:24.732
It's all right.
He sometimes does
his homework out here,

09:24.865 --> 09:25.899
but he's usually quiet
as a mouse.

09:26.033 --> 09:27.300
It's really okay.

09:27.434 --> 09:28.869
Uh, about that room...
can I pay?

09:29.002 --> 09:31.538
Yeah, sure.
Uh, that'll be $45.

09:31.672 --> 09:34.007
All right. Ah.

09:38.011 --> 09:39.880
Room 5.
Best room in the place.

09:40.013 --> 09:41.381
It even has a pool view

09:41.514 --> 09:43.183
if you're looking out
the bathroom window.

09:43.316 --> 09:45.853
Ah. I'd really like
to get to my room.

09:46.887 --> 09:48.021
Thank you.

09:48.155 --> 09:49.890
Right. Of course.

11:16.043 --> 11:18.779
Whiskey on ice.
Hold the ice.

11:20.180 --> 11:21.982
Thanks.
Can I open a tab?

11:22.115 --> 11:24.284
Why not? I'm easy.

11:24.417 --> 11:26.186
I don't think you're allowed
to say that anymore.

11:26.319 --> 11:28.655
Maybe not
where you come from,
but around here,

11:28.789 --> 11:30.824
people pride themselves
on being behind the times.

11:30.958 --> 11:32.960
This sounds like
my kind of a place.

11:33.093 --> 11:35.628
Believe me, this ain't
nobody's kind of place.

11:36.864 --> 11:38.065
Where are you from?

11:38.198 --> 11:39.432
Hmm. Where the grass
is greener.

11:39.566 --> 11:40.968
Trust me, it's brown.

11:41.101 --> 11:43.636
Soon as I can afford to,
I'm heading to L.A.

11:43.771 --> 11:45.372
Gonna be a makeup artist.

11:45.505 --> 11:48.208
I got my own YouTube channel.
You should check it out.

11:48.341 --> 11:51.144
Wow. That was fast.
Another one?

11:52.179 --> 11:53.513
You know where
I can get something

11:53.646 --> 11:55.148
a little, uh, stronger?

11:57.084 --> 11:59.352
I-I try and stay away
from that kind of stuff.

12:01.021 --> 12:02.890
I got it.
I'll take another one.

12:03.023 --> 12:08.028
<i>♪ But if I do,
it's gonna be on my terms</i>

12:08.161 --> 12:10.230
<i>♪ Yeah, if I do♪</i>

12:12.432 --> 12:14.567
You're $75 all-in.

12:16.503 --> 12:18.371
Well, uh,

12:18.505 --> 12:19.539
keep the change.

12:19.672 --> 12:20.740
Thanks.

12:27.848 --> 12:29.249
Hey, there.

12:29.382 --> 12:32.252
Vivian tells me
you're looking for a hookup.

12:32.385 --> 12:34.587
Well, Vivian's
a very helpful lady.

12:36.857 --> 12:38.391
Meet me in the back room.

12:38.525 --> 12:39.392
Five minutes.

12:46.733 --> 12:47.467
So...

12:48.668 --> 12:50.537
What are you after?

12:50.670 --> 12:52.739
Oh. Oxy, Norco.

12:52.873 --> 12:54.607
I'm an equal-opportunity
offender.

12:54.741 --> 12:56.576
Isn't that a coincidence?

12:56.709 --> 12:57.878
So are we.

12:58.011 --> 12:59.212
"We"?

13:01.348 --> 13:02.950
Look, come on.
I'm not looking
for any trouble.

13:03.083 --> 13:04.217
It's a little late
for that.

13:10.757 --> 13:13.593
You're making
this too easy, man!

13:22.435 --> 13:24.637
Hey.
He's got an iPhone, too.

13:24.771 --> 13:25.939
Take everything.

13:40.720 --> 13:42.355
You sure shine up
like a new penny.

13:42.489 --> 13:44.257
Where you off to?
Somewhere special?

13:44.958 --> 13:46.259
Something like that.

13:48.328 --> 13:51.131
You all right, son?
You look like
you've seen a ghost.

13:52.099 --> 13:53.300
Not a ghost. Just...

13:54.301 --> 13:56.269
Someone I used to know.

14:14.421 --> 14:16.323
Are you okay, mister?

14:16.456 --> 14:18.425
Oh, my God.
What the hell
are you doing, kid?

14:18.558 --> 14:21.294
Um, well, I didn't want
to touch a dead person
with my hand.

14:21.428 --> 14:23.330
Well, I'm not dead, so...

14:23.463 --> 14:24.797
Why are you sleeping
in the hallway?

14:26.633 --> 14:29.369
Hey. You know your face
is bleeding?

14:29.502 --> 14:31.804
My mom has a first-aid kit
in the office.

14:31.939 --> 14:34.574
Oh, you
got to be kidding me.

14:34.707 --> 14:36.076
What?

14:36.209 --> 14:37.477
They robbed me.

14:37.610 --> 14:40.113
Who? Burglars? Pirates?

14:40.247 --> 14:41.648
That's so cool!

14:41.781 --> 14:44.584
You should
call the cops, though.
They can help.

14:44.717 --> 14:46.853
Trust me, wherever
the pirates took my stuff,

14:46.987 --> 14:48.121
it's not coming back.

14:48.255 --> 14:50.657
So it was pirates!

14:50.790 --> 14:52.325
You know,
I'm reading this book
<i>Peter Pan</i> and...

14:52.459 --> 14:54.127
I really gotta go, bud.

14:54.261 --> 14:56.363
Are you sure you're okay?

14:56.496 --> 14:58.098
I really think my mom
can help you.

14:58.231 --> 15:00.900
Look, I don't need your mom
or a first-aid kit or a phone.

15:01.034 --> 15:02.869
Look, I just...
I need to be alone.

15:03.003 --> 15:03.903
Understand?

15:05.672 --> 15:07.340
I said get outta here!

15:15.215 --> 15:16.683
What the hell do you think
you're doing?

15:16.816 --> 15:19.186
Um... getting ice.

15:20.287 --> 15:21.454
You know what
I'm talking about.

15:21.588 --> 15:23.556
My kid said he found you
passed out in the hallway.

15:23.690 --> 15:25.658
Well, since you're here,
I, uh...

15:25.792 --> 15:26.994
I actually lost my key.

15:34.901 --> 15:37.737
Hey. I wasn't really planning
on entertaining, but...

15:37.870 --> 15:39.706
Are you listening
to anything
that I'm saying?

15:39.839 --> 15:41.774
What you did out there
was not okay.

15:41.908 --> 15:44.177
I don't want my son
seeing stuff like that.

15:44.311 --> 15:47.914
Look. No offense, lady,
but this place isn't exactly
the Ritz.

15:48.048 --> 15:51.618
You know, I'm sure
he's seen plenty of,
uh, unsavory things.

15:53.353 --> 15:55.255
At least most people
keep to themselves.

15:57.090 --> 15:58.791
What happened to you, anyway?
You're a mess.

15:58.925 --> 16:00.927
Look. I paid for my room.
I'll keep to myself.

16:01.061 --> 16:02.329
Are we done here?

16:02.462 --> 16:04.464
Actually, you owe me
for tonight.

16:05.932 --> 16:08.801
I'm not sure if your son
told you, but, uh,
I got robbed.

16:08.935 --> 16:10.603
And I'd love to pay you,
but at the moment,

16:10.737 --> 16:11.971
I've got nothing.

16:12.105 --> 16:13.406
I'm sorry. Really.

16:13.540 --> 16:16.409
But I can't let you stay
if you can't pay.

16:18.145 --> 16:20.080
Okay. I get it.
All right.

16:21.348 --> 16:22.949
I'll be out in half an hour.

16:28.221 --> 16:30.757
Look. Willy down
at Liberty Auto has been
looking for someone

16:30.890 --> 16:32.292
to help out
around the garage.

16:32.425 --> 16:34.827
Garage.
As in, like, a mechanic?

16:34.961 --> 16:36.429
More like a janitor.

16:37.230 --> 16:39.432
Unless that's beneath you.

16:39.566 --> 16:41.034
At this point,
nothing's beneath me.

16:41.168 --> 16:42.269
Then I suggest
you go see him.

16:43.270 --> 16:45.338
Okay. Great.
Thanks. Um...

16:45.472 --> 16:47.807
But do you know a doctor
I could see?

16:56.516 --> 16:58.151
Shopping for
someone special?
I am.

16:58.285 --> 16:59.952
I'd love to help.

17:00.087 --> 17:01.988
We have a beautiful selection
of roses that just came in.

17:02.122 --> 17:03.323
Top of the line.

17:03.456 --> 17:05.358
I'm actually looking
for carnations.

17:05.492 --> 17:08.195
Oh. Honey.
I think we can do better.

17:08.328 --> 17:09.629
If you ask me,

17:09.762 --> 17:11.531
carnations are the sad flower
of weddings past.

17:11.664 --> 17:14.201
Well, sad or not,
they're her favorite.

17:14.334 --> 17:16.669
She always said that people
underestimate their beauty.

17:16.803 --> 17:19.772
Okay. Understood.
Did you have a color in mind?

17:19.906 --> 17:23.176
The pink and the red
are both so lovely.

17:23.310 --> 17:24.444
She likes the purple.

17:24.577 --> 17:25.745
Ah!

17:25.878 --> 17:27.880
Is she impulsive?
Unpredictable?

17:28.014 --> 17:30.049
If it's all the same to you,
I'm in a bit of a hurry.

17:30.183 --> 17:32.485
Of course.
This'll just be a minute.

17:39.659 --> 17:41.361
She's impulsive
and unpredictable.

17:41.494 --> 17:43.196
I'm... I'm the opposite.

17:43.330 --> 17:45.698
I've been thinking about what
I'm about to do for two years.

17:45.832 --> 17:48.901
What am I gonna wear,
what should I say.

17:49.035 --> 17:50.503
Uh, didn't mean
to be short with you.

17:50.637 --> 17:52.539
I'm just a little nervous.

17:52.672 --> 17:55.842
Well, it sounds like
she is about the luckiest
woman alive.

17:55.975 --> 17:58.044
To have someone give so much
thought and attention

17:58.178 --> 17:59.912
to a moment like this.

18:00.046 --> 18:02.014
You... You really see her.

18:02.149 --> 18:04.217
And if she has no more sense
than a titmouse,

18:04.351 --> 18:05.585
she's gonna say yes.

18:05.718 --> 18:08.221
Oh, this isn't...
I'm not gonna, uh...

18:08.355 --> 18:10.557
Is she expecting it?
I hope not.

18:10.690 --> 18:12.692
A proposal's so much better
when it's a surprise.

18:12.825 --> 18:14.527
Well, trust me. After
everything that's happened

18:14.661 --> 18:15.695
in the past two years,

18:15.828 --> 18:18.097
me just showing up
is gonna be a huge surprise.

18:19.432 --> 18:21.168
Well,
looks like we're dealing with

18:21.301 --> 18:24.103
a couple of broken ribs
and a lacerated kidney.

18:24.237 --> 18:26.839
Folks in this town
sure know how to roll out
the red carpet.

18:26.973 --> 18:29.376
Then beat you
over the head with it.

18:29.509 --> 18:31.544
On a scale of 1 to 10,
how much pain are you in?

18:31.678 --> 18:33.813
I may look like
that green smiley face,

18:33.946 --> 18:36.616
but I feel like the red devil
bawling his eyes out.

18:38.851 --> 18:40.553
A while back, I got
into a car accident.

18:41.721 --> 18:43.756
Doc offered to
prescribe me oxycodone,

18:43.890 --> 18:45.158
but I turned him down.

18:45.292 --> 18:47.260
I didn't wanna risk
getting hooked.

18:47.394 --> 18:49.929
So I gutted out the pain
on Tylenol and rest.

18:50.062 --> 18:51.398
Nearly killed me.

18:51.531 --> 18:54.133
I'm not sure
I could do that again.

18:54.267 --> 18:55.968
I don't think you should.

18:56.102 --> 18:57.970
But oxycodone is
a powerful narcotic.

18:58.104 --> 19:02.275
You have to be very careful
not to overuse or abuse it.

19:02.409 --> 19:05.512
But you seem to be, uh,
more concerned
about that than most,

19:05.645 --> 19:09.482
so I'm comfortable writing you
a prescription for it.

19:09.616 --> 19:11.584
Janie will give you
four pills to tide you over

19:11.718 --> 19:13.152
till you can
get to a pharmacy.

19:13.286 --> 19:14.587
I appreciate that.

19:32.272 --> 19:34.807
So, we got the break
room, storage facility,

19:34.941 --> 19:38.345
the office, and, of course,
the garage floor.

19:38.478 --> 19:40.613
My wife wants me to
spruce the place up a bit.

19:40.747 --> 19:43.650
And what Helen wants,
Helen gets.

19:43.783 --> 19:46.185
Which is where
you come in.

19:46.319 --> 19:48.555
I need someone to do
basically all the crap

19:48.688 --> 19:49.889
I don't wanna do.

19:50.022 --> 19:51.691
Sweeping, mopping, toilets.

19:51.824 --> 19:54.827
Dusting, unloading boxes,
inventory.

19:54.961 --> 19:57.930
That a '72 Chevy Nova?
That thing's a beauty.

19:59.131 --> 20:00.300
Do not bring Layla
into this.

20:00.433 --> 20:01.734
Oh.
She's got a name, huh?

20:01.868 --> 20:04.471
She sure does.
Pain in my ass, though.

20:05.672 --> 20:06.639
She's got potential.

20:07.674 --> 20:09.442
Engine doesn't need
to be rebuilt.

20:09.576 --> 20:13.045
Suspension's solid.
Everything else
is surface rust.

20:13.179 --> 20:14.547
You know cars?

20:14.681 --> 20:16.349
I didn't have
much of a choice.

20:16.483 --> 20:17.917
I grew up watching
my dad restore

20:18.050 --> 20:19.819
anything he could
get his hands on.

20:19.952 --> 20:22.822
Spent my childhood
scouring the Detroit
junkyards with him.

20:22.955 --> 20:26.058
A Detroit boy.
That explains it.

20:26.192 --> 20:28.828
Would be sacrilegious
not to know your stuff.

20:28.961 --> 20:31.197
Ah. To be honest,
I wasn't looking for a job.

20:31.331 --> 20:34.000
But I got robbed,
I owe money on my room,

20:34.133 --> 20:36.869
and, well, it's not like
I got anywhere else to be.

20:37.003 --> 20:39.372
Plus, I love cars,
I know how to fix them,

20:39.506 --> 20:40.840
and, well, at one time

20:40.973 --> 20:43.175
I was told I was
a pretty responsible guy.

20:43.310 --> 20:44.377
Fair enough.

20:46.379 --> 20:47.780
I'll tell you what.

20:47.914 --> 20:50.517
You help me with Layla
in addition
to the other work,

20:50.650 --> 20:52.885
and I'll pay you up front.

20:53.019 --> 20:55.422
I've been trying to
restore her for months,

20:55.555 --> 20:57.557
and she's just
stubborn as hell.

20:57.690 --> 20:59.426
What do you say?

20:59.559 --> 21:00.727
Sounds like a plan.

21:05.064 --> 21:07.133
Hey. That should cover me
till Wednesday.

21:07.934 --> 21:09.802
So... it all worked out?

21:09.936 --> 21:11.237
Sure did.

21:11.371 --> 21:13.105
In fact, I even
got a promotion.

21:13.239 --> 21:14.607
I'm working
on the cars now.

21:14.741 --> 21:16.075
Thank you for your help.
Really.

21:16.208 --> 21:17.577
If there's something I can do
to pay you back...

21:17.710 --> 21:20.913
Theo. Get up.
Theo. Now!

21:21.047 --> 21:22.715
What's going on?
It's him!

21:25.452 --> 21:27.420
You want to pay me back?
Don't let him find us.

21:44.871 --> 21:46.906
Hey.
You looking for a room?

21:47.039 --> 21:48.107
I'm looking
for these two.

21:49.676 --> 21:50.943
I'm from downstate.

21:51.077 --> 21:52.745
We got a tip
she's working at a motel

21:52.879 --> 21:54.447
along this stretch
of highway.

21:54.581 --> 21:56.115
What seems
to be the problem?

21:57.717 --> 21:58.985
The problem is that
I can't find them.

21:59.619 --> 22:01.153
No. Uh, I'm sorry.

22:01.287 --> 22:03.055
What I mean is, uh,
why are you looking for them?

22:03.189 --> 22:03.990
What'd they do?

22:05.024 --> 22:07.026
What happened
to your face?

22:07.159 --> 22:08.461
Put it somewhere
it didn't belong?

22:10.597 --> 22:12.965
The photo.
Have you seen them?

22:13.099 --> 22:14.767
I can't say that I have.

22:22.241 --> 22:23.776
Hey, you need
something else?

22:27.747 --> 22:29.682
If you see them,
give me a call.

22:39.291 --> 22:41.327
Please. Don't ask.

22:41.461 --> 22:43.563
Tell me who you are
and why the police
are looking for you.

22:51.237 --> 22:52.905
I really don't want
to talk about this.

22:53.039 --> 22:54.106
And normally
I wouldn't insist,

22:54.240 --> 22:56.409
but I lied to
a police officer for you.

22:56.543 --> 22:58.511
I'm not a criminal if that's
what you're worried about.

22:58.645 --> 22:59.912
Well, you sure
acted like one.

23:00.046 --> 23:01.213
Come on.
Why was he looking for you?

23:01.347 --> 23:02.982
He's my husband.

23:03.115 --> 23:04.651
Why are you running
from him?

23:08.988 --> 23:10.990
This is from when he threw me
into our glass coffee table.

23:14.994 --> 23:16.863
It shattered, and I ended up
with 40 stitches.

23:18.030 --> 23:19.298
Oh, and...

23:20.700 --> 23:22.669
This was a fun one.

23:22.802 --> 23:25.037
One morning,
we got into a fight
because I stayed out

23:25.171 --> 23:29.041
later than expected
with a girlfriend at dinner.

23:29.175 --> 23:30.543
He threw
a cup of coffee at me,

23:30.677 --> 23:31.844
and it splashed
all over my foot,

23:31.978 --> 23:33.412
giving me
third-degree burns.

23:34.346 --> 23:35.815
That's unforgivable.

23:35.948 --> 23:38.150
And yet...
I always forgave him.

23:39.752 --> 23:41.287
He'd apologize after,

23:41.420 --> 23:42.955
bring me flowers.

23:43.089 --> 23:44.791
I always thought the next time
would be different,

23:44.924 --> 23:47.426
that I could help him
be better.

23:48.961 --> 23:50.563
If he'd stayed away
from Theodore,

23:50.697 --> 23:51.864
I probably
would've stayed.

23:53.165 --> 23:55.367
But once
after a bad day at work

23:55.502 --> 23:57.470
he came home
and wanted it quiet at dinner.

23:59.005 --> 24:00.439
Theodore was chatty,

24:01.407 --> 24:03.242
asking all about
this and that.

24:04.143 --> 24:05.712
Being a normal kid.

24:07.313 --> 24:08.748
And Shane just...

24:09.816 --> 24:10.883
Snapped.

24:12.084 --> 24:13.753
Backhanded him
across the face.

24:14.954 --> 24:17.590
He didn't even cry,
he was so shocked.

24:23.195 --> 24:24.897
We left the next morning
and never looked back.

24:26.032 --> 24:26.966
And you
didn't go to the police

24:27.099 --> 24:28.434
because he was the police.

24:28.568 --> 24:30.069
Shane's a powerful man
where we're from.

24:31.771 --> 24:33.640
Everyone told me I couldn't
just run from my problems,

24:33.773 --> 24:35.107
but I didn't see
another way out.

24:35.241 --> 24:36.909
Hey. No judgment here.

24:37.043 --> 24:39.411
I'm the poster child
for running away from mine.

24:40.880 --> 24:43.750
But if he's as bad as you say
he is, he'll be back.

24:43.883 --> 24:45.752
I just need to figure out
our next move.

24:47.053 --> 24:48.988
Gather up some cash
so we can head out again.

24:51.190 --> 24:52.725
Theodore's a really
special kid.

24:53.860 --> 24:55.294
With such an open heart.

24:57.063 --> 24:58.831
I won't let anyone
take that from him.

25:07.239 --> 25:08.340
<i>♪ Whoo!♪</i>

25:10.543 --> 25:12.679
What a cool car!

25:12.812 --> 25:14.313
Do these work?

25:15.181 --> 25:17.784
Hey. Hey! Easy!

25:19.018 --> 25:20.319
I'm sorry.

25:20.452 --> 25:21.821
Where's your mom at,
anyway?

25:21.954 --> 25:23.489
Huh?
What are you doing here?

25:23.623 --> 25:25.157
I got bored,
so I rode my bike.

25:25.291 --> 25:27.126
Then you need
to ride right back.

25:27.259 --> 25:29.528
I can't. My tire broke.

25:29.662 --> 25:30.897
Well, then we're gonna
have to call your mom

25:55.021 --> 25:58.490
Hey, didn't I tell you
not to touch anything?

25:58.625 --> 26:00.092
I've always wanted
one of these.

26:00.226 --> 26:02.261
Well, I suggest
you get one of your own.

26:03.896 --> 26:05.698
Just so you know,
I don't need a babysitter.

26:05.832 --> 26:07.566
Good, 'cause your mother
said you got to read

26:07.700 --> 26:09.135

26:09.268 --> 26:11.503
I don't have any homework.

I'm not even gonna ask

26:46.072 --> 26:47.974
How do you know
so much about cars?

26:48.107 --> 26:49.809
I used to work on them
with my dad.

26:49.942 --> 26:51.210
You don't anymore?

26:51.343 --> 26:53.545
No, no. My pops died
a long time ago.

26:55.347 --> 26:56.548
My dad died, too.

26:58.384 --> 27:00.386
I thought that was your dad
at the motel.

27:00.519 --> 27:02.021
Who? Shane?

27:02.154 --> 27:04.456
No. He's not my dad.
He's my stepdad.

27:05.557 --> 27:07.626
My real dad had
a pulmonary embolism.

27:07.760 --> 27:09.228
Whatever that means.

27:09.361 --> 27:10.096
I'm sorry.

27:11.931 --> 27:13.966
Sometimes I think
I can still see him.

27:14.100 --> 27:18.604
Like... at the grocery store
or the park.

27:18.738 --> 27:21.440
And for a second,
I just forget.

27:23.409 --> 27:25.778
And at night,
I meet him at the place

27:25.912 --> 27:27.046
between sleep and awake.

27:27.179 --> 27:28.447
The what?

27:28.580 --> 27:30.582
You know the place where you
can still remember dreaming?

27:30.717 --> 27:32.251
It's from <i>Peter Pan!</i>

27:32.384 --> 27:34.253
You really like
that book, don't you?

27:34.386 --> 27:36.022
Mmm-hmm.
I had a friend,

27:36.155 --> 27:38.157
she used to read it
to her daughter all the time.

27:38.290 --> 27:39.926
She loved it.

27:40.059 --> 27:42.995
Probably 'cause
it's really good. Duh.

27:43.129 --> 27:44.663
Anyway, I'd meet
my dad at night,

27:44.797 --> 27:47.099
and we'd go on adventures.

27:47.233 --> 27:50.837
And they're the best
adventures any two people
could ever go on.

27:50.970 --> 27:54.673
We climb mountains,
explore new galaxies.

27:54.807 --> 27:58.344
And it's awesome...
even if it's in my head.

27:58.477 --> 28:03.015
Everyone says
I have to move on,
but I don't know how to.

28:03.149 --> 28:04.116
Can't you talk
to your mom?

28:06.085 --> 28:08.320
It would just
make her worried.

28:08.454 --> 28:11.490
She just wants me to be okay,
so I pretend like I'm okay.

28:12.959 --> 28:14.160
I'm really good
at pretending.

28:15.127 --> 28:16.829
Everyone is
when they're hurt.

28:16.963 --> 28:18.664
I mean, I certainly am.

28:18.798 --> 28:22.334
You just pretend you're okay
until one day, well, you are.

28:22.468 --> 28:24.636
It just takes time.

28:24.771 --> 28:26.372
At least that's what
I keep telling myself.

28:27.173 --> 28:28.307
Me too.

28:31.643 --> 28:32.711
Uh-oh.

28:34.446 --> 28:35.214
Thanks for lunch.

28:37.483 --> 28:39.218
You and I have some things
to talk about, mister.

28:39.351 --> 28:41.153
In the car. Now.

28:52.131 --> 28:54.566
I can give you cash.
Oh, no. No, really.

28:54.700 --> 28:55.835
No. Let me.
It's on me.

28:58.037 --> 29:00.172
Well, I'm sorry
you had to watch him.

29:00.306 --> 29:01.673
I promise
it won't happen again.

29:02.809 --> 29:04.576
Really, it's...

29:04.710 --> 29:06.545
Turns out babysitting's
not that bad after all.

29:12.584 --> 29:14.753
<i>Come on, Jokers.</i>

29:14.887 --> 29:16.188
<i>Joker! Joker!</i>

29:18.657 --> 29:20.492
<i>Whoo!</i>

29:31.237 --> 29:32.671
Aren't you gonna
open the door?

29:32.805 --> 29:35.374
I'm in the middle
of something, kid.
What's up?

29:35.507 --> 29:37.609
I wanted to invite you
to my birthday party.

29:37.743 --> 29:39.111
It's on a Saturday.

29:39.245 --> 29:41.814
In our room.
3:00 p.m. sharp.

29:41.948 --> 29:43.215
It's also
<i>Peter Pan</i> -themed.

29:44.917 --> 29:46.385
You don't have to dress up
or anything.

29:46.518 --> 29:48.420
I really don't think
I can make it.

29:48.554 --> 29:51.023
There's gonna be cake.
I can't.

29:51.157 --> 29:53.192
Well, if you
change your mind...

29:53.325 --> 29:55.561
Look, I know you had fun
at the garage,

29:55.694 --> 29:57.796
but you're a kid
and I'm an adult,

29:57.930 --> 30:00.132
and like I said,
we're not friends.

30:00.266 --> 30:01.901
You're the only person
I know here.

30:02.869 --> 30:04.603
I think we're friends.

30:04.736 --> 30:07.206
Trust me. You don't wanna be
friends with someone like me.

30:07.339 --> 30:10.509
All right?
Bad things happen to people
I get close to and...

30:10.642 --> 30:13.412
I don't want that for you.
Understand?

30:27.059 --> 30:28.928
Hey. Uh...

30:37.904 --> 30:39.605
I, uh...

30:43.175 --> 30:44.676
I...

30:47.146 --> 30:48.915
Oh, Jesus.

30:51.150 --> 30:52.985
I'll just take
a seat here.

31:03.295 --> 31:05.497
And Dembe's an agent.

31:05.631 --> 31:07.466
Aram walked away
from a tech fortune.

31:09.068 --> 31:11.003
Reddington shaved his head,

31:11.137 --> 31:12.471
and his new lover's
a shaman.

31:13.805 --> 31:15.307
Park had a cancer scare

31:15.441 --> 31:19.345
because I borrowed her urine
for a drug test

31:19.478 --> 31:21.613
and it came back
with elevated hormone levels.

31:21.747 --> 31:24.350
But I passed
and got reinstated,

31:24.483 --> 31:27.119
even though my old issue
with the pain meds

31:27.253 --> 31:29.755
is back for
an encore performance

31:29.888 --> 31:33.159
after I punctured this
and broke that in a car crash

31:33.292 --> 31:35.361
while I was trying
to chase down

31:35.494 --> 31:37.496
and kill Reddington
right after you died.

31:41.767 --> 31:43.169
So I'm working
with him again.

31:44.636 --> 31:45.671
We all are.

31:45.804 --> 31:47.739
Because we think
it's what you'd want.

31:47.873 --> 31:50.542
FYI, he's just
as insufferable as ever,

31:50.676 --> 31:52.078
so if it's not
what you want,

31:52.211 --> 31:53.879
please, you feel free
to tell me,

31:54.013 --> 31:55.647
and I'll happily go back
to being a mechanic.

31:56.848 --> 31:57.916
Don't laugh.

31:58.050 --> 32:00.452
That's exactly what I was
doing for a while.

32:00.586 --> 32:02.054
After everything fell apart.

32:03.189 --> 32:04.556
After I fell apart.

32:04.690 --> 32:06.425
Did I mention I fell apart?
Yeah.

32:08.827 --> 32:09.728
I hit rock bottom.

32:11.998 --> 32:14.967
This little town
called Liberty Falls.

32:15.101 --> 32:18.437
I was...beat up
and broke,

32:19.571 --> 32:21.640
angry at myself
and the world.

32:25.044 --> 32:28.380
Then I got this job
fixing this car.

32:44.230 --> 32:45.564
<i>I didn't know it
at the time,</i>

32:45.697 --> 32:47.666
<i>but that car wasn't
the only thing I was fixing.</i>

32:54.406 --> 32:55.407
You got a minute?

32:56.142 --> 32:57.443
Hold on. What's up?

33:01.547 --> 33:03.115
I gotta call you back.

33:08.720 --> 33:11.490
I mean, when I started,
it was... it was broken.

33:11.623 --> 33:13.992
Nothing about it worked.
It was...

33:15.394 --> 33:16.628
It was dead to the world.

33:17.729 --> 33:18.697
But when I finished,

33:18.830 --> 33:20.699
I looked at that car,
I thought...

33:20.832 --> 33:22.768
Well, I didn't think anything.

33:22.901 --> 33:24.103
I just...

33:25.104 --> 33:26.238
<i>I felt something.</i>

33:27.473 --> 33:29.341
<i>Something I hadn't felt

33:35.114 --> 33:37.216
I felt like I could feel...

33:38.884 --> 33:40.086
Good.

34:01.107 --> 34:03.142

34:15.053 --> 34:15.987

34:23.295 --> 34:25.864
Well?
What'd you wish for?

34:25.997 --> 34:27.933
You're not
supposed to tell.

34:28.066 --> 34:29.501
Fair enough.

34:29.635 --> 34:31.203
Should I cut you
the first slice?

34:31.337 --> 34:32.871
Sure.

34:33.004 --> 34:34.005
You know,

34:35.141 --> 34:37.143
it won't always
be like this.

34:37.276 --> 34:40.346
One day,
whatever you wished for...

34:41.180 --> 34:42.681
I know it'll come true.

34:45.217 --> 34:46.385
I thought he'd come.

34:46.518 --> 34:50.122
Oh, honey.
He has a lot going on.

34:50.256 --> 34:52.624
I'm sure he really
wanted to be here.

34:52.758 --> 34:55.461
If he really wanted to,
he would have come.

34:55.594 --> 34:58.564
I wish we never moved.
I have no friends.

34:58.697 --> 35:01.433
You don't let us go anywhere.
I hate it here!

35:02.934 --> 35:03.935
He came!

35:07.173 --> 35:09.441
Teddy! Ha!
That's not my name.

35:11.009 --> 35:13.212
You don't need to
be afraid of me, son.

35:13.345 --> 35:16.014
I know your mom's been
filling your head
with a bunch of garbage.

35:16.148 --> 35:19.351
So you'd really rather live
in this dump than come home?

35:19.485 --> 35:20.952
Pathetic. Even for you.

35:21.086 --> 35:22.554
What are you doing here?

35:22.688 --> 35:24.590
Can't I come see my wife?

35:24.723 --> 35:27.125
I'm gonna call the cops.
I really wouldn't do that.

35:28.460 --> 35:30.162
Stop!
Get out of here, son.

35:30.296 --> 35:31.563
This is
an adult conversation.

35:32.731 --> 35:34.766
I'm not asking you again!
Get out!

35:34.900 --> 35:35.934
It's okay, sweetie.

35:36.067 --> 35:37.569
I'll be okay. Go.

35:49.915 --> 35:52.117
Hey, bud. Happy birthday.
Sorry I'm late.

35:52.251 --> 35:53.785
What's going on?

35:53.919 --> 35:54.953
He found us! He's here!

35:58.056 --> 36:00.259
Aah! Let go of me!

36:04.230 --> 36:07.098
Oh! What the hell?
You crazy bitch!

36:08.600 --> 36:10.101
Now what are you gonna do?

36:10.236 --> 36:11.737
Huh? Think you're gonna
be able to pull that again?

36:11.870 --> 36:14.172
You don't have it in you!
You're weak!

36:14.306 --> 36:15.507
Always have been!

36:17.643 --> 36:19.411
Get away from her!

36:39.965 --> 36:41.600
So that's what
I've been up to.

36:41.733 --> 36:43.802
I'd move
every couple weeks.

36:43.935 --> 36:46.004
To stay distracted,

36:46.137 --> 36:48.274
keep from thinking
about what happened,

36:49.308 --> 36:51.142
keep from thinking
about you.

36:51.277 --> 36:53.312
I tried to mind
my own business, but...

36:53.445 --> 36:55.647
Yeah. You know me.

36:55.781 --> 36:57.249
That wasn't always possible.

37:03.154 --> 37:04.155
How are you doing?

37:04.290 --> 37:05.657
I'm okay.
Shaken up.

37:06.392 --> 37:07.693
How's Theodore?

37:07.826 --> 37:09.661
He finally fell asleep.
Thank God.

37:09.795 --> 37:11.997
We're waiting
on the M.E.'s report,
but from every indication

37:12.130 --> 37:13.465
it's clear
this was self-defense.

37:13.599 --> 37:14.866
I told the officer
about your husband,

37:15.000 --> 37:16.468
and, uh,
the story checks out.

37:16.602 --> 37:19.671
Turns out he was pretty
open about coming for you,
how mad he was.

37:19.805 --> 37:21.673
Agent Ressler also told us
about what he'd done to you.

37:21.807 --> 37:24.042
And with your permission,
we'd like to reach out
to county hospital

37:24.175 --> 37:25.877
and just verify the extent
of the injuries.

37:26.011 --> 37:27.346
"Agent" Ressler?

37:27.479 --> 37:28.880
Ex-agent.

37:29.014 --> 37:32.083
Well, ex or not, this man
is a decorated FBI agent.

37:32.217 --> 37:34.453
He had
a distinguished career.
You don't say.

37:34.586 --> 37:36.221
You were very lucky
to have him in your corner
when you did.

37:36.355 --> 37:37.456
You're gonna need
to sign a release

37:37.589 --> 37:39.291
to give him
the medical records.

37:39.425 --> 37:40.959
Yeah, once we get them
and the M.E.'s report,

37:41.092 --> 37:42.428
we'll have
everything we need.

37:42.561 --> 37:43.895
Ma'am. Sir.

37:45.697 --> 37:47.433
Why didn't you
tell me anything?

37:47.566 --> 37:49.067
It's a long story.

37:49.200 --> 37:50.602
You were
a decorated agent,

37:50.736 --> 37:52.838
now you work
in a small-town garage.

37:52.971 --> 37:55.507
However long that story takes
to tell, I'd like to hear it.

37:56.241 --> 37:57.609
Well, I appreciate it,

37:57.743 --> 37:59.778
but, uh, it's not
a story I can tell.

37:59.911 --> 38:01.046
Not yet, anyway.

38:01.179 --> 38:03.148
I understand.
Whenever you're ready.

38:04.783 --> 38:06.618
I'm not
who you think I am.

38:06.752 --> 38:09.921
Maybe. But you're more
than you think you are.

38:10.055 --> 38:12.458
He was right. I was lucky
to have you in my corner.

38:12.591 --> 38:15.694
But...
maybe you're lucky, too.

38:15.827 --> 38:18.063
'Cause I'm in yours.

38:18.196 --> 38:21.467
Look. I got a lot of luck.
It's just... It's never good.

38:21.600 --> 38:23.134
Then maybe
it's about to change.

38:23.268 --> 38:26.372
If you're looking
for a fresh start, so am I.

38:28.006 --> 38:30.141
Is it crazy to think
we could look together?

38:30.275 --> 38:32.077
It's not crazy.

38:32.210 --> 38:33.945
It's just...

38:34.079 --> 38:35.647
It's not something
I can do right now.

38:36.281 --> 38:37.349
Alone is hard.

38:39.150 --> 38:41.453
You helped me
confront my past.

38:41.587 --> 38:43.422
Let me help you
confront yours.

38:46.892 --> 38:48.627
Mr. Ressler?
Are you in there?

38:53.632 --> 38:54.833
Mr. Ressler?

39:09.948 --> 39:12.350
I know there are good people
out there.

39:12.484 --> 39:13.719
People I could connect with.

39:13.852 --> 39:15.020
People I should
connect with.

39:16.488 --> 39:18.790
But I don't. I can't.

39:23.261 --> 39:24.295
Not yet, anyway.

39:27.298 --> 39:28.500
Theodore?

39:32.438 --> 39:35.574
You were right.
He was a bad guy.

39:35.707 --> 39:37.976
No. I wasn't.

39:42.481 --> 39:44.382
<i>You</i> were right.

39:44.516 --> 39:46.217
You saw the good in him
when I couldn't.

39:47.352 --> 39:48.820
And he saved us.

39:50.088 --> 39:51.823
If he's so good,
then why'd he just walk away?

39:53.358 --> 39:55.961
I know it might be hard
for you to understand,

39:56.094 --> 39:58.997
but he's in a lot of pain.

40:01.332 --> 40:03.234
Do you think
he'll ever come back?

40:03.368 --> 40:04.102
Honestly?

40:05.471 --> 40:06.838
I don't know.

40:37.035 --> 40:39.871
I mean, I used
to hate you, no offense,

40:40.005 --> 40:41.740
but there's no point
in denying it.

40:41.873 --> 40:43.642
Still...

40:45.744 --> 40:46.878
I'm happy you're not alone.

40:48.379 --> 40:51.082
<i>You know, I told Harold
that I was coming tonight,</i>

40:51.216 --> 40:54.019
and he said that Agnes
wants today to be

40:54.152 --> 40:56.622
a celebration of your life,
not a memory of your death.

40:56.755 --> 40:58.123

40:59.090 --> 41:00.592

41:03.061 --> 41:05.897

figured out yet.

41:12.137 --> 41:13.672

41:16.207 --> 41:18.677
Maybe we can meet there
sometime...

41:18.810 --> 41:20.278
Go on adventures together.

41:21.880 --> 41:24.916
