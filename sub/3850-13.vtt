00:00.081 --> 00:01.637
He reads to Scotty every night,

00:01.638 --> 00:02.818
takes him to school every morning.

00:02.819 --> 00:04.626
Your brother has stepped up.

00:04.627 --> 00:05.829
Was he stepping up

00:05.830 --> 00:07.998
when he fell off the wagon two weeks ago?

00:07.999 --> 00:09.800
Previously on "Mistresses"...

00:09.801 --> 00:11.602
He doesn't know that I'm sick.

00:11.603 --> 00:13.837
- He won't forgive you for not telling him.
- I will.

00:13.838 --> 00:14.672
After tomorrow.

00:14.673 --> 00:17.307
This award means the world to him.

00:20.078 --> 00:22.112
I killed my husband alone.

00:22.113 --> 00:24.581
Josslyn Carver had nothing to do with it.

01:31.750 --> 01:33.817
Oh, my God, Karen, Joss is out!

01:33.818 --> 01:34.918
I cannot believe it.

01:34.919 --> 01:36.620
Call me back. Bye.

01:39.858 --> 01:41.525
I overheard. That's great news.

01:41.526 --> 01:42.593
Yeah, it is.

01:43.895 --> 01:46.930
You want to talk about it?

01:46.931 --> 01:49.066
Nope.

01:50.668 --> 01:52.669
Just tell me one thing.

01:52.670 --> 01:54.037
- Did you drink in the house?
- No.

01:54.038 --> 01:55.606
When you were driving the kids around?

01:55.607 --> 01:56.807
Of course not. I would never do that.

01:56.808 --> 01:59.343
When you took them to see my
mural in Shantytown that night?

01:59.344 --> 02:01.578
I swear to you, April, it was
never anywhere near the kids.

02:01.579 --> 02:02.346
Scotty was out of town.

02:02.347 --> 02:03.847
I spent the night at Harry's.

02:03.848 --> 02:05.015
It was... it was two days.

02:05.016 --> 02:06.917
It was a slip... a 48-hour slip.

02:06.918 --> 02:10.586
But I'm on it with my sponsor,
and I'm in meetings every day.

02:10.588 --> 02:11.688
Okay.

02:11.689 --> 02:13.090
"Okay"? What does that mean?

02:13.091 --> 02:14.258
What do you want it to mean, Marc?

02:14.259 --> 02:15.292
Look, I'm sorry you're so upset,

02:15.293 --> 02:16.326
but why are you surprised?

02:16.327 --> 02:18.562
You know better than
anyone what sobriety is,

02:18.563 --> 02:20.097
that it's a constant friggin' battle.

02:20.098 --> 02:22.032
No, I don't know
what sobriety is, remember?

02:22.033 --> 02:23.967
My experience is living with people

02:23.968 --> 02:27.371
who say they don't have
a problem when they do!

02:29.107 --> 02:30.707
I just... I don't get it.

02:30.708 --> 02:31.742
What triggered it?

02:31.743 --> 02:35.345
Everything seemed fine. You seemed fine.

02:39.751 --> 02:41.752
Whatever.

02:41.753 --> 02:42.820
It doesn't matter.

02:42.821 --> 02:44.121
Like you said, it was just a slip.

02:44.122 --> 02:45.989
Yeah.

02:45.990 --> 02:48.258
It was my slip, not yours.

02:50.662 --> 02:53.764
I don't understand why you're
taking it so personally.

02:58.937 --> 03:00.404
I want to be in there.

03:00.405 --> 03:02.973
Please, Alec, can you
come sit so we can talk?

03:02.974 --> 03:04.808
- Hey, guys.
- What's happening?

03:04.809 --> 03:06.810
Vivian's awake and stable for the moment.

03:06.811 --> 03:09.246
Her liver failed, which was
the cause of her collapse.

03:09.247 --> 03:12.149
Now we're alternating cyclo and prednisone.

03:12.150 --> 03:15.018
Deterioration of the G.I.
Tract is most likely next.

03:15.019 --> 03:17.154
Just wait! W-what...
what are you talking about?

03:17.155 --> 03:19.356
- Alec...
- She's in acute GVH?!

03:19.357 --> 03:21.024
How is my wife suddenly in acute GVH?!

03:21.025 --> 03:22.426
You just saw her last week!

03:22.427 --> 03:23.994
How'd you not see this coming?!

03:25.830 --> 03:29.433
The doctor told Vivian two days
ago that she was in stage 1.

03:29.434 --> 03:32.903
We had no idea it would
progress this quickly.

03:34.706 --> 03:37.541
I'm sorry, Dr. Jenkins. Will you excuse us?

03:37.542 --> 03:39.977
Of course.

03:39.978 --> 03:41.979
I'm so sorry, Alec.

03:41.980 --> 03:43.981
But she begged me not to tell you.

03:43.982 --> 03:46.016
She was gonna check in
first thing tomorrow morning.

03:46.017 --> 03:48.485
Get out of here, Karen.

04:04.802 --> 04:06.903
- Hi.
- Hi.

04:09.841 --> 04:11.174
You okay?

04:11.175 --> 04:12.009
Are you kidding me?

04:12.010 --> 04:14.344
This is the best moment of my life.

04:15.680 --> 04:17.337
Well, that and, you know,

04:17.338 --> 04:19.339
using the toilet with the, uh, door closed.

04:19.339 --> 04:20.420
That was pretty great, too.

04:21.509 --> 04:24.211
- Yeah, I'll bet.
- Oh! Mmm.

04:25.813 --> 04:27.480
Is that yours or mine?

04:27.481 --> 04:31.351
- It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter.
- Mm, no.

04:31.352 --> 04:34.955
I know, but I haven't spoken
to Karen or April at all yet.

04:34.956 --> 04:36.189
Hold on a second.

04:36.190 --> 04:37.657
Oh, uh.

04:37.658 --> 04:38.658
It's yours.

04:38.659 --> 04:40.694
Um, it's a text from Ari.

04:40.695 --> 04:42.270
"RDS wants to meet tomorrow"?

04:42.271 --> 04:43.270
Who's RDS?

04:43.271 --> 04:45.438
Uh, Rocco Dispirito.

04:45.439 --> 04:46.506
Oh, yeah, you mentioned him.

04:46.507 --> 04:48.008
What... what's it for?

04:48.009 --> 04:50.177
Oh, it's an interview to write
his next cookbook with him

04:50.178 --> 04:52.579
and to be in some webseries, apparently.

04:52.580 --> 04:53.680
What?!

04:53.681 --> 04:55.448
That's amazing, honey!

04:55.449 --> 04:56.283
Mm, is it?

04:56.284 --> 04:57.050
- Harry!
- What?

04:57.051 --> 04:58.818
Seriously, this could be awesome.

04:58.819 --> 05:00.487
It could make you a frickin' star!

05:00.488 --> 05:02.689
I don't think a webseries ever
made anyone a star, did it?

05:02.690 --> 05:04.324
Well, mm, no, but it doesn't...

05:04.325 --> 05:06.426
it could still get you
out from under the thumb

05:06.427 --> 05:09.329
of that raging butthole... what's... Ellis.

05:09.330 --> 05:11.164
Oh, isn't that why you hired Ari anyway?

05:11.165 --> 05:12.332
- Mm.
- Hmm?

05:12.333 --> 05:13.500
Okay, listen...

05:13.501 --> 05:15.202
this is how tomorrow's gonna go.

05:15.203 --> 05:17.337
Okay, we're going to
role-play the whole interview.

05:17.338 --> 05:19.451
I'm gonna get you confident
and prepared, and then we'll...

05:19.452 --> 05:20.934
- But can you do me a favor?
- Yes.

05:20.935 --> 05:22.769
Keep planning, but can you, uh...

05:22.770 --> 05:24.300
Can you just do it... do it from down here?

05:24.301 --> 05:25.038
Oh.

05:25.039 --> 05:26.106
- Just do that.
- Yes.

05:27.608 --> 05:29.075
I just got excited.

05:29.076 --> 05:31.678
Yeah, I saw that.

05:31.679 --> 05:34.247
Oh, God, I just...

05:34.248 --> 05:36.683
Oh, baby, I think after
everything that's happened,

05:36.684 --> 05:38.685
I-I... really, I just want to attack life.

05:38.686 --> 05:40.954
- You know?
- Yeah.

05:40.955 --> 05:43.356
You want to talk about what's happened?

05:43.357 --> 05:44.936
No, I do not.

05:44.937 --> 05:46.338
You know me, Harry... I'm a ruminator.

05:46.339 --> 05:48.839
And I think if I relive that nightmare,

05:48.840 --> 05:51.909
I'm just gonna get stuck. I'm
not gonna be able to stop, so...

05:51.910 --> 05:53.744
Can I just... can I just be a dude?

05:53.745 --> 05:56.747
Just John Wayne this?

05:56.748 --> 05:58.749
I really...

05:58.750 --> 06:00.851
I just want to focus on our future,

06:00.852 --> 06:02.920
our life, and our new house.

06:04.489 --> 06:06.991
I don't want to waste
another precious moment

06:06.992 --> 06:09.460
talking about Cal...

06:09.461 --> 06:10.694
I don't want to say her name, okay?

06:10.695 --> 06:12.396
- You don't have to.
- Okay.

06:14.639 --> 06:16.673
Hey, Raines, new lawyer here to see you.

06:16.674 --> 06:18.475
Not today. Send him away.

06:18.476 --> 06:19.610
You want me to...

06:19.611 --> 06:22.345
I want you to send him away.

06:30.121 --> 06:32.355
Can you get it?

06:33.191 --> 06:36.326
They catch you with it,
it'll be bad for you.

06:36.327 --> 06:38.695
I know what I'm doing.

06:43.569 --> 06:44.436
Who's gonna do it?

06:44.437 --> 06:46.482
Hmm? Are you gonna do it?

06:46.483 --> 06:48.217
You know I can't do it.

06:48.218 --> 06:49.418
I'll do it from here.

06:49.419 --> 06:50.953
God, you guys are wusses!

06:50.954 --> 06:52.688
Frickin' sissies, I tell you!

06:52.689 --> 06:55.658
A toast!

06:55.659 --> 06:57.460
No, sir, this is a private toast.

06:57.461 --> 06:58.427
Thank you.

06:58.428 --> 07:01.397
To my ladies.

07:01.398 --> 07:02.365
No, to you.

07:02.366 --> 07:03.632
To your freedom.

07:03.633 --> 07:04.533
Shh!

07:04.534 --> 07:05.501
My toast!

07:07.938 --> 07:11.107
Thank you, guys, for all the care packages

07:11.108 --> 07:13.876
and the letters that came every day.

07:13.877 --> 07:15.945
Words can't express how amazing it is

07:15.946 --> 07:17.880
to just be standing here with you.

07:17.881 --> 07:19.248
I thought I loved you before,

07:19.249 --> 07:21.717
but when you think that you'll
never have something again,

07:21.718 --> 07:23.652
you just... you know.

07:23.653 --> 07:25.588
I know.

07:25.589 --> 07:27.189
I know.

07:27.190 --> 07:29.625
Oh, my God, stop! Enough! Moving on!

07:29.626 --> 07:30.826
All right, enough.

07:30.827 --> 07:32.027
Mm, okay.

07:32.028 --> 07:34.764
So, can you tell us what happened?

07:34.765 --> 07:36.432
Did David explain why Calista confessed?

07:36.433 --> 07:38.200
Did she suddenly wake up a decent person?

07:38.201 --> 07:40.703
No, no, she did not...
that woman would never

07:40.704 --> 07:42.938
do a self-sacrificing thing
in her life without an agenda,

07:42.939 --> 07:44.840
but, seriously, that's all
I want to say about it...

07:44.841 --> 07:46.708
- Okay?
- Okay.

07:48.278 --> 07:49.412
Honey, what's going on?

07:49.413 --> 07:51.680
I'm so sorry to do this to you, sweetie,

07:51.681 --> 07:52.948
but I think I have to go.

07:52.949 --> 07:54.015
Why? What happened?

07:55.285 --> 07:56.685
Vivian's in the hospital.

07:56.686 --> 07:58.087
Oh, no.

07:58.088 --> 07:59.955
And I think this might be it for her.

07:59.956 --> 08:00.823
What?!

08:00.824 --> 08:01.891
Karen, no.

08:01.892 --> 08:03.559
Alec banished me from the hospital,

08:03.560 --> 08:04.994
so I'm counting on this freakin' doctor

08:04.995 --> 08:06.295
to text me updates.

08:06.296 --> 08:07.906
It's... you should go.
You should be with her.

08:07.907 --> 08:09.031
Yeah, why don't we just drive you?

08:09.032 --> 08:11.367
No, no, no, please stay and celebrate.

08:11.368 --> 08:13.002
I love you, guys.

08:13.003 --> 08:14.602
Welcome home.

08:19.209 --> 08:22.111
Well, my problems seem trivial.

08:22.112 --> 08:24.380
Next to death and incarceration, maybe,

08:24.381 --> 08:26.314
but tell me what's going on.

08:27.784 --> 08:29.151
Marc and I had a fight.

08:29.152 --> 08:30.319
Aw.

08:30.320 --> 08:32.321
He fell off the wagon
a couple of weeks ago.

08:32.322 --> 08:34.289
Let me guess... you took it personally?

08:34.291 --> 08:36.692
I did. I don't know why.
I mean, he caught himself.

08:36.693 --> 08:37.793
He's back in meetings.

08:37.794 --> 08:39.794
It didn't affect me or the kids at all,

08:39.796 --> 08:41.464
but he didn't tell me about it.

08:41.465 --> 08:43.198
I mean we live together.

08:43.200 --> 08:45.034
Marc and I co-parent, for God's sakes.

08:45.035 --> 08:46.936
Why didn't he tell me he was hurting?

08:46.937 --> 08:48.904
After everything I've shared with him?

08:48.905 --> 08:51.240
I have shared some dark
stuff about my past...

08:51.241 --> 08:53.108
stuff that I have never told anyone.

08:53.109 --> 08:53.909
No offense.

08:53.910 --> 08:55.177
Oh, none taken.

08:55.178 --> 08:57.713
I guess I just thought that
we were closer than that.

08:57.714 --> 08:59.114
But...

08:59.115 --> 09:02.383
He meant something to me
that I didn't mean to him.

09:25.141 --> 09:26.609
Hello, hello, hello!

09:26.610 --> 09:27.576
Good day.

09:27.577 --> 09:28.777
- Nice to see you.
- Thank you.

09:28.778 --> 09:29.778
You gonna cook in that?

09:29.779 --> 09:31.146
Ari didn't mention we'd be cooking,

09:31.147 --> 09:32.248
but that's... that's good.

09:32.249 --> 09:34.183
Yeah, yeah. Uh, talk now, cook later?

09:34.184 --> 09:35.985
Come over here. Have a seat.

09:35.986 --> 09:37.086
Want some coffee or something?

09:37.087 --> 09:38.807
- No, I'm good. Thank you.
- All right.

09:40.156 --> 09:42.091
- Now, remind me. You are?
- Harry Davis.

09:42.092 --> 09:44.393
- Of, uh, Wunderbar, right?
- That's right, yeah.

09:44.394 --> 09:46.262
Why do you, uh, want to work with me?

09:46.263 --> 09:48.797
You know, there's the answer
I would've given yesterday

09:48.798 --> 09:51.267
and the one that just hit
me about... two minutes ago.

09:51.268 --> 09:52.801
Why don't you give me yesterday's?

09:52.802 --> 09:54.870
When faced with "the man",

09:54.871 --> 09:56.572
you've always stood your ground,

09:56.573 --> 09:58.407
and if that ground gets challenged,

09:58.408 --> 10:00.276
you say, "screw it, then. I'll fly."

10:00.277 --> 10:02.011
You made a brand out of your name

10:02.012 --> 10:03.445
and a life on your own terms.

10:03.446 --> 10:04.880
What about today's answer?

10:06.049 --> 10:08.417
Well, you know, uh...

10:08.418 --> 10:13.522
My mum worked two jobs,
and my dad did not approve.

10:13.523 --> 10:17.459
So he always made sure to be
asleep before she got home.

10:17.460 --> 10:19.094
And my older brothers and sister

10:19.095 --> 10:21.630
were... were kind of wild
and not really around either,

10:21.631 --> 10:26.335
so at about 6 years old...

10:26.336 --> 10:28.270
Started making dinner for myself,

10:28.271 --> 10:30.472
and, uh, I guess it tasted pretty good

10:30.473 --> 10:32.207
'cause soon the whole family

10:32.208 --> 10:34.410
would start straggling into the kitchen

10:34.411 --> 10:36.278
every night at the same time...

10:36.279 --> 10:39.214
To come together and wait for my meal...

10:39.215 --> 10:41.215
and for mum to come home.

10:42.085 --> 10:45.253
T-this is you. This is you
in the photograph, right?

10:46.022 --> 10:47.188
It is.

10:50.760 --> 10:52.962
Anyway, you know, the gig,
uh, it starts immediately.

10:52.963 --> 10:53.677
Yeah, I know.

10:53.678 --> 10:55.464
So, we're gonna be
traveling through Europe.

10:55.465 --> 10:57.466
We're gonna be tasting local dishes.

10:57.467 --> 10:58.701
We're gonna be cooking

10:58.702 --> 11:00.936
and amassing this collection of recipes.

11:00.937 --> 11:02.071
Sorry to interrupt.

11:02.072 --> 11:04.506
Rocco, um, the webseries shoots in Europe?

11:04.507 --> 11:05.307
Webseries?

11:05.308 --> 11:07.109
Dude, this is food network...

11:07.110 --> 11:10.411
13 episodes, 10 countries,
12 months of footage.

11:23.293 --> 11:24.593
Oh, my God, how did it go?!

11:24.594 --> 11:27.630
Uh, yeah, it was, uh
it was g... it was fine.

11:27.631 --> 11:29.098
I mean, he's a great guy.

11:29.099 --> 11:30.432
We, uh, we talked, and I cooked,

11:30.433 --> 11:32.001
and he definitely liked my food, so...

11:32.002 --> 11:32.868
That's amazing!

11:32.869 --> 11:33.969
You're totally gonna get it!

11:33.970 --> 11:35.204
I wouldn't count on it, Joss.

11:35.205 --> 11:36.639
He's seeing a lot of other chefs.

11:36.640 --> 11:38.273
Well, yeah, but you're
still in the running, right?

11:38.274 --> 11:39.241
Yeah.

11:39.242 --> 11:40.976
So don't give up.

11:42.479 --> 11:44.613
You know what I'd like to do
more than anything right now?

11:44.614 --> 11:47.049
See the house with you.

11:47.050 --> 11:48.539
You want to meet me
there for the inspections?

11:48.540 --> 11:50.152
Oh, baby, I am on my way.

11:50.153 --> 11:51.652
Bye.

11:57.727 --> 12:02.431
Whoa.

12:02.432 --> 12:03.831
Oh, my God.

12:24.354 --> 12:27.656
Don't worry. He's not here. You're safe.

12:27.657 --> 12:29.725
He told you?

12:29.726 --> 12:32.594
I knew when you weren't here,
he must've forced you to go.

12:32.595 --> 12:35.130
I should never have put
you in that position, Karen.

12:35.131 --> 12:36.799
I can handle it.

12:36.800 --> 12:38.133
I know.

12:38.134 --> 12:39.835
You should've seen the way he yelled at me.

12:39.836 --> 12:40.903
He didn't.

12:40.904 --> 12:42.171
No.

12:44.340 --> 12:46.241
I haven't seen him in hours, actually.

12:46.242 --> 12:47.476
Really? Where'd he go?

12:47.477 --> 12:50.945
I don't know... to Koreatown
to find a new donor.

12:52.615 --> 12:55.017
He's probably in his office...

12:55.018 --> 12:58.053
Calling about trials, cashing in favors.

12:58.054 --> 12:59.221
You know Alec.

12:59.222 --> 13:03.425
What can I do? Can I call any family?

13:03.426 --> 13:06.595
Mm, my sister's flying in tomorrow.

13:07.797 --> 13:10.331
My parents are cutting
their Budapest trip short.

13:13.970 --> 13:17.071
It's happening so fast, Karen.

13:22.245 --> 13:24.413
How are you feeling, mama?

13:24.414 --> 13:26.248
Are your boobs really sore?

13:26.249 --> 13:28.249
I hear the boobs get sore.

13:29.085 --> 13:32.420
They're a bit tender and bigger...

13:33.256 --> 13:34.690
...for me.

13:34.691 --> 13:37.960
Can I feel your stomach?

13:37.961 --> 13:39.895
There's no bump, really, yet.

13:39.896 --> 13:41.897
Just humor me?

13:42.999 --> 13:44.066
You got it.

13:48.705 --> 13:52.239
Hmm.

14:05.555 --> 14:06.789
But it's your favorite.

14:06.790 --> 14:07.956
I want you to have it.

14:07.957 --> 14:10.392
And we can talk every
day, and we can Facetime.

14:10.393 --> 14:12.027
My mom won't get me a phone.

14:12.028 --> 14:13.262
Well, you can use my phone.

14:13.263 --> 14:15.262
Come on, sweetie, Ron's waiting in the car.

14:17.333 --> 14:18.534
I'm gonna miss you so much.

14:18.535 --> 14:19.767
I'll miss you, too.

14:22.005 --> 14:22.938
Hey.

14:22.939 --> 14:24.006
Come here, dude.

14:25.208 --> 14:27.976
Now, you ready to go on
your recon mission to Vegas?

14:27.977 --> 14:28.777
Mm-hmm.

14:28.778 --> 14:31.079
Remember, you scout it out.

14:31.080 --> 14:33.048
You give me the thumbs-up...

14:33.049 --> 14:34.483
And bam...

14:34.484 --> 14:35.617
I'm there for a visit,

14:35.618 --> 14:37.586
and we'll check out all the cool spots.

14:37.587 --> 14:38.954
You're not gonna live with us?

14:38.955 --> 14:40.355
No...

14:40.356 --> 14:43.325
'Cause you and your mom are gonna
move into Ron's house, and...

14:43.326 --> 14:44.993
Vegas isn't my home.

14:44.994 --> 14:46.560
Is this your home?

14:48.064 --> 14:49.832
Okay, well, we're gonna hit traffic.

14:49.833 --> 14:51.166
Let's go.

14:51.167 --> 14:53.135
I love you, buddy. You know that.

14:53.136 --> 14:54.036
I love you, too.

14:56.940 --> 14:59.875
Hey, sweetheart.

14:59.876 --> 15:02.911
You come back and visit anytime, okay?

15:02.912 --> 15:04.079
I'm heading out to work.

15:04.080 --> 15:05.914
Why don't I throw your bags in the car?

15:05.915 --> 15:07.114
I'll help.

15:14.090 --> 15:15.457
I feel I should...

15:15.458 --> 15:18.160
Thank you for everything.

15:18.161 --> 15:20.094
No problem.

15:23.700 --> 15:26.001
Don't be mad at Marc.

15:26.002 --> 15:28.570
He didn't hide his drinking
from you to be sneaky.

15:28.571 --> 15:31.106
He just didn't want you
to think any less of him.

15:31.107 --> 15:33.408
I'm not sure he cares what I think.

15:33.409 --> 15:36.178
Well, of course he does.

15:36.179 --> 15:38.045
He's in love with you, April.

15:40.416 --> 15:42.283
How did you not see that?

15:51.095 --> 15:52.998
- What do you want?
- I want a restraining order.

15:52.999 --> 15:54.900
- Against who... Calista?
- Yes, against Calista.

15:54.901 --> 15:56.435
Oh, come on. Joss, she's in jail.

15:56.436 --> 15:57.770
Are you sure about that?

15:57.771 --> 16:00.172
Because I saw her Range Rover
driving down San Vicente today.

16:00.173 --> 16:02.374
And I saw one on Olive...
they made a few of those cars.

16:02.375 --> 16:03.909
Joss, she's in jail.

16:03.910 --> 16:05.644
She's behind bars... she
can't hurt you from there.

16:05.645 --> 16:08.080
It's taunting me, David. She's...
she's trying to get inside my head.

16:08.081 --> 16:10.316
And I'm really... I'm just trying
to get on with my life, okay?

16:10.317 --> 16:12.184
- I won't have this.
- I'll see a judge about it, okay?

16:12.185 --> 16:13.986
Today, it's a basket.
Tomorrow, it's a boiled bunny.

16:13.987 --> 16:16.621
Joss, I said don't worry.
I'll take care of it.

16:17.958 --> 16:19.123
Okay.

16:36.609 --> 16:38.577
Hey. You're headed out?

16:38.578 --> 16:40.379
Yeah, just going to see Joss.

16:40.380 --> 16:41.981
Must be nice to have her back.

16:41.982 --> 16:44.049
Oh, mate, you've got no idea.

16:44.050 --> 16:45.751
Uh, hey, listen, before you go,

16:45.752 --> 16:47.419
I've got kind of a thorny question.

16:47.420 --> 16:49.887
Um, how much time would
you need to replace me?

16:50.991 --> 16:53.092
What? You're quitting?

16:53.093 --> 16:55.127
Oh, wow.

16:55.128 --> 16:57.663
Uh, w-what happened? Did
you find a better job?

16:57.664 --> 16:58.664
No, it's not that.

16:58.665 --> 17:00.733
I think the... the Marc-L.A. experiment

17:00.734 --> 17:02.267
has kind of run its course.

17:02.268 --> 17:04.203
Think I might go trek Machu Picchu,

17:04.204 --> 17:05.804
get off the grid for a while.

17:05.805 --> 17:07.940
Uh-huh.

17:07.941 --> 17:09.241
Did April reject you?

17:09.242 --> 17:12.977
I think it's safe to say I
have plummeted in her esteem.

17:13.847 --> 17:15.746
She found out about the drinking.

17:17.617 --> 17:19.952
And the way she used to look at me?

17:19.953 --> 17:21.119
That look that...

17:21.121 --> 17:23.955
Gave me hope that maybe
someday she might...

17:23.957 --> 17:25.257
Feel the same?

17:25.258 --> 17:28.060
Well... That, my friend, is gone.

17:28.060 --> 17:29.395
So you're just gonna run away?

17:29.396 --> 17:31.363
What's my life here, really, Harry?

17:31.364 --> 17:33.565
Living in an R.V., working in a kitchen.

17:33.566 --> 17:35.501
I don't even want to be a chef.

17:35.502 --> 17:37.703
I mean, aside from your friendship,

17:37.704 --> 17:40.272
which has meant a lot to me, by the way...

17:40.273 --> 17:42.640
There's nothing in this place for me.

17:48.415 --> 17:51.582
Except the woman you're
in love with, right?

17:55.722 --> 17:57.488
Thanks for everything, man.

18:18.244 --> 18:19.912
He left me one, too.

18:19.913 --> 18:22.915
Hey, honey.

18:22.916 --> 18:23.982
Are you okay?

18:23.983 --> 18:26.185
I'm okay. I mean...

18:26.186 --> 18:28.954
I knew when Scotty left,
he was bound to go, too.

18:28.955 --> 18:30.222
But we're gonna be pen pals.

18:30.223 --> 18:32.790
I'm in his life forever, he said.

18:35.628 --> 18:37.796
So, um, you want to come with me to work,

18:37.797 --> 18:39.698
or I can find somebody to watch you.

18:39.699 --> 18:41.300
I can stay by myself now, mom.

18:42.936 --> 18:45.471
You're right. Oh, you're all grown up.

18:47.040 --> 18:48.974
Hey, um, can I see the letter?

18:48.975 --> 18:50.642
Sure.

18:50.643 --> 18:52.043
Thanks.

19:09.696 --> 19:12.498
See, this is exactly why
I didn't want to tell you.

19:12.499 --> 19:13.966
Harry, please, it's taken care of.

19:13.967 --> 19:15.901
I promise you she's not
gonna contact me again.

19:15.902 --> 19:17.503
I want to hear about your interview.

19:17.504 --> 19:18.770
I just... I don't understand.

19:18.771 --> 19:21.640
How did she get her stationery from jail?

19:21.641 --> 19:24.243
Well, you can get anything
with money and determination,

19:24.244 --> 19:25.477
and she's got both, but...

19:25.478 --> 19:27.679
Please, you tell me about
Rocco... I want details.

19:27.680 --> 19:29.348
David is gonna take care of this, right?

19:29.349 --> 19:30.682
Do I need to call him again?

19:30.683 --> 19:33.318
No. Here. Honey, let's just
focus on what's important.

19:33.319 --> 19:34.887
I... here.

19:34.888 --> 19:37.856
Just tell me about your interview, please.

19:37.857 --> 19:39.825
Yeah, it was horrible.

19:39.826 --> 19:41.560
- It was horrible?
- And great.

19:41.561 --> 19:42.728
Okay.

19:42.729 --> 19:45.497
First of all, it is not
some little webseries.

19:45.498 --> 19:48.467
It's a real network show... 13 episodes.

19:48.468 --> 19:49.635
Holy crap!

19:49.636 --> 19:52.004
200 grand up front and
back-end points on the book.

19:52.005 --> 19:53.272
What?! And he liked you?

19:53.273 --> 19:54.239
Yeah, I believe so.

19:54.240 --> 19:56.108
So, why are you not smiling?

19:56.109 --> 19:57.376
Because even if I get it...

19:57.377 --> 19:58.744
and that is a very big "if"...

19:58.745 --> 20:00.245
there is no way I'm gonna take it.

20:00.246 --> 20:01.180
Why?

20:01.181 --> 20:02.347
It's 12 months abroad, Joss...

20:02.348 --> 20:04.116
a year traveling through Europe.

20:04.117 --> 20:05.784
Ah.

20:05.785 --> 20:07.085
Oh, my God.

20:07.086 --> 20:08.187
Mm-hmm.

20:08.188 --> 20:10.122
Mm. Okay.

20:12.158 --> 20:14.493
Harry, come on.

20:14.494 --> 20:15.928
I love you, but don't be an idiot.

20:15.929 --> 20:17.763
Of course you have to
take it if you get it.

20:17.764 --> 20:19.064
Did you hear what I just said?

20:19.065 --> 20:20.399
Did you hear what you just said?!

20:20.400 --> 20:22.167
It's a year in Europe with Rocco.

20:22.168 --> 20:23.268
It's incredible!

20:23.269 --> 20:25.103
Yeah, it would be incredible, except...

20:25.104 --> 20:26.805
Harry, come here.

20:26.806 --> 20:28.373
No, come here.

20:28.374 --> 20:29.374
Baby...

20:29.375 --> 20:30.242
Hmm?

20:30.243 --> 20:32.945
I am yours... forever.

20:32.946 --> 20:34.780
A year is not gonna change anything.

20:34.781 --> 20:35.647
You say that now.

20:35.648 --> 20:36.782
I know it. I know.

20:36.783 --> 20:38.917
Don't you understand what
this could mean for you?

20:38.918 --> 20:41.019
This could give you all
the power in the world

20:41.020 --> 20:43.222
to make your life exactly
what you want it to be,

20:43.223 --> 20:44.957
make our life what we want it to be.

20:44.958 --> 20:46.692
Joss...

20:46.693 --> 20:47.926
I just got you back.

20:47.927 --> 20:49.161
I know, but... mm...

20:49.162 --> 20:51.029
planes, trains, and automobiles, baby.

20:51.030 --> 20:53.632
I'll come visit a lot, and...

20:53.633 --> 20:56.468
When I can't, we can Skype or...

20:56.469 --> 20:57.903
Sext.

20:57.904 --> 20:59.037
Write love letters?

20:59.038 --> 21:00.305
We can write love letters.

21:00.306 --> 21:01.273
Little love letters.

21:01.274 --> 21:02.674
Little love letters from Europe

21:02.675 --> 21:04.176
with little pasta stains on them.

21:04.177 --> 21:04.943
Mm.

21:04.944 --> 21:06.945
Hmm?

21:06.946 --> 21:08.714
Okay, call, call.

21:08.715 --> 21:10.115
- Really?
- Yeah, call the Israeli.

21:10.116 --> 21:11.116
Tell her to push for it.

21:11.117 --> 21:13.250
- I love you so much.
- I love you, too.

21:17.590 --> 21:20.459
Hey, it's Harry Davis. Is she in?

21:34.507 --> 21:35.374
Vivian?!

21:35.375 --> 21:36.275
Vivian!

21:36.276 --> 21:38.076
We need a doctor in here!

21:38.077 --> 21:39.811
Vivian?!

21:39.812 --> 21:41.580
Page Dr. Adams quickly... please!

21:41.581 --> 21:43.115
Karen, I need you to step outside.

21:43.116 --> 21:45.183
We're gonna take care of her, okay?

21:45.184 --> 21:47.586
Yeah, I've got it.

21:47.587 --> 21:48.654
Stand by.

21:49.889 --> 21:52.090
Damn it, Alec, pick up!

22:02.932 --> 22:05.582
Sh-should we wait for Alec?

22:05.583 --> 22:08.585
Just tell me.

22:08.586 --> 22:11.321
The good news is, she's a fighter.

22:11.322 --> 22:12.489
The bad news is,

22:12.490 --> 22:14.825
she's deteriorating a lot
faster than we anticipated.

22:14.826 --> 22:17.527
The crash that just occurred
was due to septic shock.

22:17.528 --> 22:18.996
The bacteria in her bloodstream

22:18.997 --> 22:20.831
caused her lungs to fill with fluid.

22:20.832 --> 22:22.299
Her blood pressure dropped.

22:22.300 --> 22:24.034
We've put her on a respirator.

22:24.035 --> 22:25.168
What happens next?

22:25.169 --> 22:27.204
Her organs are shutting
down one by one, Karen.

22:27.205 --> 22:29.673
After the lungs is the heart...

22:29.674 --> 22:31.808
And that's the last thing to go.

22:31.809 --> 22:35.545
Her loved ones should come
say what they need to say now.

22:35.546 --> 22:36.646
Can I see her?

22:36.647 --> 22:38.315
In a bit... she's in
isolation at the moment.

22:38.316 --> 22:41.551
- I'll let you know when she's ready, okay?
- Okay.

22:46.524 --> 22:48.358
This is Dr. Alec Adams.
Please leave a message.

22:48.359 --> 22:49.425
Come on!

22:52.230 --> 22:54.531
So, you're just gonna
live in the house alone?

22:54.532 --> 22:55.699
Uh, what?

22:55.700 --> 22:58.802
If Harry goes to Europe,
are you just gonna...

22:58.803 --> 22:59.703
Live in that house alone?

22:59.704 --> 23:02.506
Um, yeah, I-I... I don't know.

23:02.507 --> 23:03.907
I-I guess so, right?

23:03.908 --> 23:05.142
It's still our house.

23:05.143 --> 23:07.711
It's the home he'd be coming
home to, so, yeah, I guess.

23:07.712 --> 23:09.780
Well, if you get lonely
in that big, old house,

23:09.781 --> 23:11.648
you can crash with me whenever you want.

23:11.649 --> 23:13.083
God knows the place is empty.

23:13.084 --> 23:14.351
Scotty left?

23:14.352 --> 23:16.453
Yep. So did Marc.

23:16.454 --> 23:18.455
What?! When... already?

23:18.456 --> 23:20.690
What was he gonna do...
live with me as a boarder?

23:20.691 --> 23:21.658
Are you okay?

23:21.659 --> 23:23.693
Yeah, I...

23:23.694 --> 23:25.595
Just got used to coming
home to him, I guess,

23:25.596 --> 23:27.297
s-seeing him in the middle of the night

23:27.298 --> 23:29.332
- when neither of us could sleep.
- Right.

23:29.333 --> 23:31.101
He made me laugh like nobody else.

23:31.102 --> 23:32.636
The guy is really funny.

23:32.637 --> 23:34.237
And he had this way of taking care of me

23:34.238 --> 23:35.605
without me knowing it, you know?

23:35.606 --> 23:36.673
Mm-hmm.

23:36.674 --> 23:37.974
Without making me feel "less than"

23:37.975 --> 23:39.476
or like I couldn't take care of myself.

23:39.477 --> 23:41.311
Wow.

23:41.312 --> 23:44.347
Sounds like a really, um,
special kind of friend, April.

23:44.348 --> 23:47.717
Who was really adorable, too, you know?

23:47.718 --> 23:49.152
Do you hear yourself right now?

23:49.153 --> 23:50.220
I do.

23:50.221 --> 23:51.888
I just don't recognize the voice.

23:51.889 --> 23:53.023
Um, it's the voice of a woman

23:53.024 --> 23:54.324
who's completely in love with Marc.

23:54.325 --> 23:55.225
Oh!

23:55.226 --> 23:56.326
Oh, my...

23:56.327 --> 23:58.395
when did this happen?

23:58.396 --> 24:01.865
How did I miss this? How
did I not see myself?!

24:01.866 --> 24:04.734
Oh, my God, I have to call him.

24:04.735 --> 24:06.837
Yes, you do... immediately!

24:08.172 --> 24:09.673
You're blushing!

24:09.674 --> 24:11.007
Oh, my God!

24:11.008 --> 24:13.510
- The mailbox is full.
- What?

24:13.511 --> 24:15.679
This number cannot accept
messages at this time.

24:16.681 --> 24:17.981
I'm kind of hungry for Wunderbar.

24:17.982 --> 24:19.216
You want to go over there?

24:19.217 --> 24:20.383
Thatagirl! Yes!

24:20.384 --> 24:21.985
Okay, I just got to do
one thing in the back.

24:21.986 --> 24:22.853
Okay.

24:22.854 --> 24:24.621
Oh, my God!

24:32.263 --> 24:34.496
U-uh, April, I'll meet you there, okay?!

24:44.642 --> 24:46.810
Alec?

24:46.811 --> 24:50.814
I'm on the phone with Karolinska
University hospital in Stockholm.

24:50.815 --> 24:52.182
Hang up the phone, Alec.

24:52.183 --> 24:53.817
They just cured a case of advanced GVH

24:53.818 --> 24:55.185
using mesenchymal stem cells.

24:55.186 --> 24:56.453
Yes, no, I'm still holding.

24:56.454 --> 24:57.754
Vivian needs you downstairs.

24:57.755 --> 24:59.389
This is the one, Karen. I can feel it.

24:59.390 --> 25:00.690
Let me have the phone.

25:00.691 --> 25:01.525
What are you doing?

25:01.526 --> 25:03.326
It's happening now, Alec.

25:03.327 --> 25:04.694
She's going, and you're gonna miss it.

25:04.695 --> 25:06.563
Do you want to be up
here chasing a miracle,

25:06.564 --> 25:08.564
or do you want to say goodbye to your wife?

25:11.435 --> 25:12.802
I can't.

25:12.803 --> 25:14.136
Yes, you can.

25:16.140 --> 25:19.341
I can't bear it, Karen.

25:21.812 --> 25:23.512
There's got to be something I can do.

25:25.283 --> 25:27.516
You can be with her.

25:32.123 --> 25:33.989
Hi.

25:35.560 --> 25:37.693
I'm happy you're here.

25:39.130 --> 25:40.764
I thought you'd...

25:40.765 --> 25:43.433
Come sooner, but it's okay.

25:43.434 --> 25:46.336
Cut the crap, Calista.

25:46.337 --> 25:47.237
What are you...

25:47.238 --> 25:48.371
You're gonna walk in here

25:48.372 --> 25:50.207
all nice and innocent like that?

25:50.208 --> 25:52.609
I... I know what you did.

25:52.610 --> 25:55.145
I'm not an idiot. I got
it all figured out, okay?

25:55.146 --> 25:57.647
You realized you wouldn't
stand a chance in hell at trial,

25:57.648 --> 25:58.782
so you copped to it.

25:58.783 --> 26:00.817
It's... it's really,
really smart, you know?

26:00.818 --> 26:03.253
You might get a lighter
sentence from the judge, it's...

26:03.254 --> 26:05.088
'Cause everybody knows you're guilty.

26:05.089 --> 26:07.529
I mean, for God's sakes, even
Patty thinks you're guilty.

26:08.726 --> 26:10.492
Um...

26:12.330 --> 26:13.830
...I'm not quite sure why you're here.

26:13.831 --> 26:17.000
I want you to stop texting me, Calista.

26:17.001 --> 26:19.169
I want you to stop sending me stuff.

26:19.170 --> 26:20.937
Stop contacting me... at all.

26:20.938 --> 26:22.606
I'm not contacting you.

26:22.607 --> 26:23.740
I know you, Calista.

26:23.741 --> 26:24.941
No, you don't know me.

26:24.942 --> 26:27.544
It was your frickin'
handwriting on the stationery.

26:27.545 --> 26:29.846
I don't know what's
happening to you out there,

26:29.847 --> 26:33.515
but I-I assure you, it
has nothing to do with me.

26:34.418 --> 26:35.518
I don't know.

26:35.519 --> 26:38.388
Maybe whoever killed
Luca is coming after you.

26:38.389 --> 26:43.159
Uh, s-so, are you saying that the
real killer is out there, taunting me?

26:43.160 --> 26:45.595
That's... why would
anyone do that, Calista?

26:45.596 --> 26:46.963
I don't know.

26:46.964 --> 26:49.032
I don't know why anyone does anything,

26:49.033 --> 26:54.070
but I do know why you are out there, free.

26:54.071 --> 26:56.872
That's friendship.

26:59.076 --> 27:01.511
I wish you well.

27:01.512 --> 27:03.378
I do.

27:19.683 --> 27:20.649
Patty Deckler.

27:20.650 --> 27:22.318
Hi, Patty. It's Josslyn Carver.

27:22.319 --> 27:23.652
What could you possibly want?

27:23.653 --> 27:24.954
I realize that I'm the last person

27:24.955 --> 27:26.155
that you want to talk to, okay?

27:26.156 --> 27:27.957
But I just

27:27.958 --> 27:29.625
I was hoping that maybe you could tell me

27:29.626 --> 27:30.559
why Calista confessed.

27:30.560 --> 27:31.961
What do you care? You're out.

27:31.962 --> 27:35.149
Please, Patty, did you
get her some kind of a deal

27:35.150 --> 27:36.288
or a lighter sentence or something

27:36.289 --> 27:37.424
if she fessed up to the truth?

27:37.425 --> 27:38.048
Not at all.

27:38.049 --> 27:39.816
In fact, the only way
she was gonna get a deal

27:39.817 --> 27:41.217
was if she threw you under the bus,

27:41.218 --> 27:42.152
which I urged her to do.

27:42.153 --> 27:43.753
- So, then why...
- Why, indeed.

27:43.754 --> 27:45.689
Because she cared about you, apparently,

27:45.690 --> 27:47.857
and I guess she just
couldn't let you go down

27:47.858 --> 27:49.726
for something she knew you didn't do.

27:49.727 --> 27:50.860
Is that it? I'd like to go now.

27:50.861 --> 27:52.652
So, you're telling me

27:52.653 --> 27:54.503
that the basket wasn't sent to taunt me?

27:54.504 --> 27:55.937
It was an actual "welcome home"?

27:55.938 --> 27:56.972
What basket?

27:56.973 --> 27:58.507
Calista sent me a gift basket yesterday.

27:58.508 --> 28:00.375
That's not possible. She's in prison.

28:00.376 --> 28:02.043
We both know she can get
anything from the outside.

28:02.044 --> 28:03.912
She had magazines and candy
within minutes of being there.

28:03.913 --> 28:05.514
The woman has access.

28:05.515 --> 28:07.849
Oh, she did have access through me,

28:07.850 --> 28:10.051
but then she fired me, remember?

28:10.052 --> 28:12.087
So she's got nobody else now.

28:18.161 --> 28:19.528
He quit?

28:19.529 --> 28:20.662
Just like that?

28:20.663 --> 28:22.497
Mm, yeah, I tried to talk him into staying,

28:22.498 --> 28:23.899
but his mind was...

28:23.900 --> 28:25.300
Was pretty made up.

28:25.301 --> 28:26.501
Well, do you know where he went?

28:26.502 --> 28:27.281
I'd tried calling...

28:27.282 --> 28:28.897
So, he didn't go and
see you before he left?

28:28.898 --> 28:30.272
Left?!

28:30.273 --> 28:31.106
Where did he go?

28:31.107 --> 28:33.008
Well, I don't know exactly.

28:33.009 --> 28:35.911
He mentioned something
about heading to Machu Picchu

28:35.912 --> 28:37.879
and going off the grid for a while.

28:37.880 --> 28:39.080
What?!

28:39.081 --> 28:41.249
Yeah, he seemed to think
he needed distance from...

28:41.250 --> 28:42.884
from here to figure some stuff out.

28:42.885 --> 28:44.786
I mean, personally, I
thought he should stay and,

28:44.787 --> 28:46.488
you know...

28:46.489 --> 28:47.522
Confront things.

28:47.523 --> 28:49.925
Yeah, um...

28:49.926 --> 28:52.426
Confronting would've
been... would've been good.

28:55.298 --> 28:57.232
Look, April, he... he
may call me to check in.

28:57.233 --> 28:59.434
If he does, I'll tell him
you were looking for him.

28:59.435 --> 29:01.502
I know he'd be really happy to hear that.

29:03.139 --> 29:04.304
Okay.

29:06.309 --> 29:09.209
Oh, sorry, April, can you
excuse me for one second?

29:13.883 --> 29:15.116
Pack your bags, baby.

29:15.117 --> 29:16.651
You're gonna cook on the continent.

29:16.652 --> 29:18.854
- No way.
- Congratulations. So...?

29:18.855 --> 29:20.255
Do I tell Rocco you accept?

29:20.256 --> 29:22.990
Yes. I accept, yes!

29:25.428 --> 29:26.828
- Wait a second.
- What?

29:26.829 --> 29:28.662
I need you to get me one thing.

29:30.299 --> 29:32.801
Hi, have you seen a
tall... he's right there.

29:32.802 --> 29:34.435
Thank you.

29:35.638 --> 29:37.389
- Honey?
- Hey.

29:37.390 --> 29:38.151
What's happening?

29:38.152 --> 29:39.901
Why am I meeting you here?
I thought you were at work.

29:39.902 --> 29:40.727
I was, but, uh...

29:42.096 --> 29:43.195
I got the gig.

29:44.198 --> 29:46.875
- You got the gig?!
- Uh-huh.

29:46.876 --> 29:48.811
Oh, my God, honey, I'm so proud of you!

29:48.812 --> 29:50.480
Oh, hang on, but there's
only one rub, though.

29:50.481 --> 29:51.547
Um...

29:51.548 --> 29:52.882
They want to leave tomorrow night.

29:52.883 --> 29:55.518
Rocco wants to catch the
end of the Festa Di Noiantri.

29:55.519 --> 29:57.020
It's this food festival in Rome.

29:57.021 --> 29:58.388
They want to leave tomorrow night?

29:58.389 --> 30:00.055
Yeah.

30:01.592 --> 30:03.593
So, you want to come with me, or what?

30:03.594 --> 30:04.594
What are you... what?

30:04.595 --> 30:06.429
I told Ari I would not take the gig

30:06.430 --> 30:08.064
unless my love could come, too.

30:08.065 --> 30:10.133
You are in the contract,
baby. So what do you say?!

30:10.134 --> 30:11.401
Oh, my God!

30:11.402 --> 30:12.635
- Are you kidding me right now?!
- No!

30:12.636 --> 30:13.503
Oh, my God!

30:14.405 --> 30:15.772
I was gonna miss you so much!

30:15.773 --> 30:16.939
I know, I know.

30:16.940 --> 30:17.874
I know.

30:17.875 --> 30:18.875
- Let's celebrate, huh?
- Yes.

30:18.876 --> 30:20.610
Can we grab those drinks now, please, mate?

30:20.611 --> 30:23.079
Thank you.

30:23.080 --> 30:24.047
You okay?

30:24.048 --> 30:25.682
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah?

30:25.683 --> 30:28.151
Just... mm, I'm great.

30:28.152 --> 30:30.252
- Whew!
- Oh, my God.

30:37.594 --> 30:39.829
There he is.

30:39.830 --> 30:41.463
Hi, love.

30:45.002 --> 30:46.969
I must look pretty terrible, huh?

30:46.970 --> 30:48.171
You look great, kid.

30:48.172 --> 30:49.938
You lie.

30:51.041 --> 30:52.241
Karen?

30:52.242 --> 30:53.942
Come sit.

30:55.446 --> 30:57.246
Shouldn't you have your mask on, darling?

30:57.247 --> 30:59.048
I'll put it back in a minute.

30:59.049 --> 31:00.450
Can you give me your phone?

31:00.451 --> 31:01.584
You want to call someone?

31:01.585 --> 31:04.085
Just give it, Ali.

31:09.193 --> 31:10.660
Is this thing recording?

31:10.661 --> 31:13.396
Oh, no, buddy. You're in this thing.

31:13.397 --> 31:16.065
You too, Karen.

31:16.066 --> 31:17.233
Nurse, could you maybe...

31:17.234 --> 31:18.934
Sure.

31:28.779 --> 31:31.413
Hi, there, baby.

31:34.017 --> 31:36.819
I'm Vivian.

31:36.820 --> 31:39.622
And these two beautiful people by my side

31:39.623 --> 31:41.758
are your mom...

31:41.759 --> 31:43.124
And your dad.

31:44.361 --> 31:48.164
And I love them both dearly.

31:48.165 --> 31:51.968
I won't get to meet you...

31:51.969 --> 31:54.970
Which really sucks.

31:56.440 --> 31:58.941
Because I know that you would've been

31:58.942 --> 32:02.310
the most amazing thing to
have happened in my life.

32:03.947 --> 32:07.116
And God knows my life has been filled...

32:07.117 --> 32:09.017
With amazing things.

32:14.324 --> 32:16.092
Now...

32:16.093 --> 32:19.227
There's some things you need to know.

32:21.632 --> 32:23.847
Yes, I know how it sounds, Detective, okay?

32:23.848 --> 32:25.548
But that basket didn't come from her, so...

32:25.549 --> 32:28.257
Right, so, what, you
just got your confession,

32:28.258 --> 32:30.458
and now you're not concerned
about the truth, or...

32:31.328 --> 32:33.256
Yeah, uh, well, you were satisfied

32:33.257 --> 32:34.957
thinking that I did it
for the longest time,

32:34.958 --> 32:37.360
and I'm innocent, so what I'm saying...

32:37.361 --> 32:39.462
what I'm saying is, I just...

32:39.463 --> 32:41.503
I think that the real killer
may still be out there.

32:42.766 --> 32:43.733
I'm sorry.

32:43.734 --> 32:45.968
Can you just hold on one second?

32:45.969 --> 32:47.436
Harry, hi!

32:47.437 --> 32:48.871
Listen, before you say anything,

32:48.872 --> 32:50.306
uh, this call is being filmed.

32:50.307 --> 32:52.074
Wait, oh, my God, they're there already?!

32:52.075 --> 32:54.777
Yep, Grizz and I are on
our way to pick you up now.

32:54.778 --> 32:56.546
Grizz is the, uh, camera guy.

32:56.547 --> 32:58.147
Yeah I have a camera guy.

32:58.148 --> 32:59.282
Harry, I'm... I'm not ready yet.

32:59.283 --> 33:00.516
I don't... uh, I'm not even dressed,

33:00.517 --> 33:02.919
and I-I have no idea where my passport is.

33:02.920 --> 33:04.687
- What?
- It's fine. No, don't worry.

33:04.688 --> 33:07.185
It's... it's around here somewhere.
Um, I'll meet you there, okay?

33:07.186 --> 33:08.553
Joss, uh...

33:08.554 --> 33:09.988
Joss, you cannot be late.

33:09.989 --> 33:11.056
It's already 6:00.

33:11.057 --> 33:12.257
I know, I know! I won't!

33:12.258 --> 33:13.091
I-I love you.

33:13.092 --> 33:14.693
I-I promise, okay? Bye.

33:15.595 --> 33:17.696
Detective Whitehead?

33:17.697 --> 33:19.096
Oh, damn it!

33:23.603 --> 33:25.604
Um, hi. This is Josslyn Carver.

33:25.605 --> 33:27.506
I received a basket
from you guys yesterday,

33:27.507 --> 33:30.075
but it had someone's, um,
personal stationery on it.

33:30.076 --> 33:31.043
How does that happen?

33:31.044 --> 33:32.144
She brought it in personally,

33:32.145 --> 33:33.545
along with her own wines from home.

33:33.546 --> 33:35.180
Wait, who brought it in personally?

33:35.181 --> 33:36.415
The woman who bought your basket.

33:36.416 --> 33:38.350
Do you remember her name
or what she looked like?

33:38.351 --> 33:39.518
Was it Maritza?

33:39.519 --> 33:41.420
I don't remember, and
she paid in cash, so...

33:41.421 --> 33:42.654
All right, okay, thanks.

33:52.665 --> 33:54.231
Viv?

33:56.335 --> 33:58.235
Can you hear me?

33:59.839 --> 34:02.373
I was just thinking...

34:04.310 --> 34:07.511
That after everything I've
been through in my life...

34:09.982 --> 34:12.216
...very little surprises me.

34:13.418 --> 34:15.152
But you...

34:17.223 --> 34:18.989
You surprised me.

34:20.092 --> 34:22.659
Boy, did you surprise me.

34:24.197 --> 34:27.231
And I am so grateful for that.

34:28.134 --> 34:30.469
When I first met you...

34:30.469 --> 34:32.804
I was so lost.

34:32.804 --> 34:34.539
Remember?

34:34.540 --> 34:39.210
I thought saving you
would give my life meaning.

34:39.212 --> 34:40.178
But now...

34:42.014 --> 34:44.014
Now, sitting here...

34:45.650 --> 34:47.083
...I know that loving you...

34:49.322 --> 34:51.289
...is what has.

34:51.290 --> 34:53.625
My sweet...

34:53.626 --> 34:55.492
Graceful friend.

35:11.077 --> 35:14.446
Vivian?

35:14.447 --> 35:16.548
Vivian?

35:34.867 --> 35:37.435
Yeah, but I don't understand your website,

35:37.436 --> 35:38.870
which is why I called you!

35:39.672 --> 35:40.939
I can't tell from this page

35:40.940 --> 35:43.341
what time the flight to
Machu Picchu actually leaves.

35:43.342 --> 35:46.912
Every time I click on it, it crashes.

35:46.913 --> 35:48.993
Well, can you tell me how to stop a person

35:48.994 --> 35:50.982
from getting on that flight?

35:50.983 --> 35:52.551
"Go to the airport."

35:53.452 --> 35:55.287
You've been very helpful!

36:10.369 --> 36:12.270
I sold my R.V.

36:12.271 --> 36:13.572
You did?

36:13.573 --> 36:17.108
I thought it was time to
just choose a place and...

36:17.109 --> 36:18.210
Start planting roots.

36:19.712 --> 36:22.514
Look, I don't like L.A. much.

36:22.515 --> 36:24.349
I mean, I get why people
who were born here stay,

36:24.350 --> 36:27.051
but I don't get why people choose it.

36:27.787 --> 36:29.621
So I polled a few people...

36:29.622 --> 36:31.022
On the street.

36:31.023 --> 36:32.357
Oh, yeah?

36:33.893 --> 36:34.960
What did they say?

36:34.961 --> 36:37.528
That people come here for two reasons.

36:38.364 --> 36:40.665
For career...

36:40.666 --> 36:41.666
And for love.

36:41.667 --> 36:43.735
We both know I don't have a career.

36:43.736 --> 36:45.269
I don't even have a job.

36:47.073 --> 36:49.908
But I think I'm in love.

36:49.909 --> 36:51.675
Well, I know it, actually.

36:54.013 --> 36:55.981
I love you, April.

37:01.854 --> 37:04.589
And I clearly caught you
on your way to something.

37:06.659 --> 37:08.625
So I'll... Just let you go.

37:10.863 --> 37:13.531
I don't need to go anymore!

37:13.532 --> 37:15.666
Why not?

37:17.737 --> 37:19.170
I was coming to find you.

37:33.252 --> 37:35.220
Maritza, hey, it's Joss... again.

37:35.221 --> 37:37.822
I I don't understand why
you're not picking up.

37:37.823 --> 37:39.194
Please, I-I really need to talk to you.

37:39.195 --> 37:42.159
Can you call me back
as soon as you get this?

37:47.233 --> 37:48.033
Damn it!

37:48.968 --> 37:50.135
Mm, where is she?

37:50.136 --> 37:52.404
I have no idea. I'm
gonna call her again now.

37:54.240 --> 37:55.840
Hey, Harry, uh, check this out.

37:55.841 --> 37:57.676
This is our itinerary.
We're gonna start here.

37:57.677 --> 37:59.044
We're gonna end up in Rome,

37:59.045 --> 38:01.079
just in time for this
incredible food festival.

38:35.848 --> 38:37.682
Well...

38:37.683 --> 38:39.383
This is mine.

38:40.820 --> 38:41.987
Okay, then.

39:13.019 --> 39:15.754
Under your pillow.

39:44.750 --> 39:45.884
Hello?

39:50.356 --> 39:52.590
Damn it, Joss, where are you?
They're ready to take off.

39:52.591 --> 39:54.225
She can take the next commercial flight.

39:54.226 --> 39:55.560
She'll be two hours behind us.

39:58.998 --> 40:00.398
I love you.

40:01.600 --> 40:03.268
I have to go.

40:03.269 --> 40:04.869
Just get on the next flight, okay?

40:09.842 --> 40:10.675
Maritza?

40:11.811 --> 40:12.811
Is someone here?

40:24.723 --> 40:28.093
Maritza?

40:28.094 --> 40:30.027
Hello?

40:40.139 --> 40:42.474
Hello? Is anyone here?

40:55.121 --> 40:56.621
Oh, my God, Calista?!

40:58.958 --> 41:00.091
Wilson?

41:02.061 --> 41:04.796
Where you going, lovely?
