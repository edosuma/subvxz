WEBVTT

00:05.005 --> 00:07.108
WE ARE NOT GONNA DO
ANYTHING EMBARRASSING,
RIGHT?

00:07.141 --> 00:09.077
MEL, IT IS YOUR
BACHELORETTE PARTY.

00:09.110 --> 00:11.312
I KNOW. I JUST DON'T
WANT TO DO ANYTHING
I'M GOING TO REGRET.

00:11.345 --> 00:15.049
UM...WILL YOU SETTLE FOR
NOTHING YOU'LL REMEMBER?

00:15.083 --> 00:17.418
OH, YEAH,
THAT'S FINE.

00:22.390 --> 00:23.224
HEY!
HEY!

00:23.257 --> 00:24.792
HI, MEL. I JUST WANTED
TO DROP THIS OFF.

00:24.825 --> 00:26.560
I CAN'T STAY.
MY BABYSITTER JUST FLAKED.

00:26.594 --> 00:29.797
NO. NO, NO, NO.
YOU HAVE TO STAY.
YOU'RE A BRIDESMAID.

00:29.830 --> 00:30.731
YEAH!
SORRY, NO SITTER.

00:30.764 --> 00:33.734
LILY. LILY, HEY, WHAT
ARE YOU DOING TONIGHT?

00:33.767 --> 00:35.436
GOING OUT LIKE
YOU ORDERED ME TO.

00:35.469 --> 00:38.406
YEAH, ABOUT THAT, UM,
I NEED A LITTLE FAVOR.

00:38.439 --> 00:39.173
FAYE NEEDS A BABYSITTER.

00:39.207 --> 00:41.709
SO NOW YOU'RE
ORDERING ME TO STAY?

00:41.742 --> 00:42.710
PLEASE?

00:42.743 --> 00:44.312
YOU READY, LILY?

00:44.345 --> 00:47.248
OH! I'M SORRY.

00:47.281 --> 00:49.150
WE DIDN'T
REALIZE
YOU HAD PLANS.

00:49.183 --> 00:51.585
IT'S NOT A DATE!
WE'RE JUST
GOING TO A MOVIE!

00:51.619 --> 00:53.254
I DIDN'T SAY
IT WAS A DATE.

00:53.287 --> 00:54.355
STOP TALKING
ABOUT IT!

00:54.388 --> 00:58.159
WE CAN'T GO TO
THE MOVIE. MY MOM'S
MAKING ME BABYSIT.

00:58.192 --> 00:59.227
Boy: WANT SOME HELP?

00:59.260 --> 01:00.694
NO.

01:02.430 --> 01:03.531
ARE YOU COMING?

01:03.564 --> 01:05.099
ALL RIGHT.

01:05.133 --> 01:05.999
HERE.
THANKS.

01:06.033 --> 01:10.171
SO, WHERE ARE
SEAN AND THE BOYS
TONIGHT?

01:10.204 --> 01:11.239
NOT HERE. THAT'S
ALL THAT MATTERS.

01:11.272 --> 01:13.574
I'M SURE THEY'RE HAVING FUN
DOING WHATEVER THEY DO.

01:13.607 --> 01:16.610
Henry: I--I--I CAN'T
KEEP RUNNING, DAD!

01:16.644 --> 01:17.845
Dad: YOU'VE GOT TO!

01:17.878 --> 01:19.747
OH!
OW!

01:20.748 --> 01:22.450
I JUST GOT HIT
WITH A SNO-CONE!

01:22.483 --> 01:25.186
WE'RE ALL GONNA DIE!

01:25.519 --> 01:28.522
STOP THROWING FOOD
AT ME!

01:42.703 --> 01:46.440
COME ON IN, GIRLS.
THE WATER IS ALCOHOL.

01:46.474 --> 01:49.243
I SAW
YOUR X-RATED CAKE
IN THE REFRIGERATOR.

01:49.277 --> 01:52.413
SHH! DON'T TELL MEL.
IT IS A SURPRISE.

01:52.446 --> 01:54.415
YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE?

01:54.448 --> 01:55.616
I GOT A STRIPPER.

01:55.649 --> 01:59.587
SHE SO DOESN'T WANT
A STRIPPER. THIS IS
GOING TO BE GREAT!

01:59.620 --> 02:01.355
I KNOW.

02:01.655 --> 02:02.656
I ALMOST FORGOT
WHAT THIS WAS LIKE.

02:02.690 --> 02:07.261
YOU KNOW, GIRLS' NIGHT
AND ONE NAKED MAN FOR HIRE.

02:07.295 --> 02:09.230
HEY, CLAUD,
I'LL EXPLAIN EVERYTHING.

02:09.263 --> 02:10.398
JUST PRETEND
I'M NOT HERE, OK?

02:10.431 --> 02:13.867
BUT YOU ARE HERE.
WH

02:13.901 --> 02:15.836
DON'T WORRY.
THEY'RE HERE, TOO.

02:16.704 --> 02:19.740
MOM! OH!

02:19.773 --> 02:22.710
I THOUGHT I'D NEVER
SEE YOUR FACE AGAIN.

02:22.743 --> 02:23.511
WHAT?

02:23.544 --> 02:24.512
AH, AN OVERREACTION.

02:24.545 --> 02:26.547
MAN, I THOUGHT
I WAS GONNA DIE.

02:26.580 --> 02:27.581
Melanie:
OH, HEY, SEAN, YOU'RE HERE.

02:27.615 --> 02:29.817
LOOK, THERE'S THESE GUYS
LOOKING FOR YOU OUT FRONT,

02:29.850 --> 02:31.252
BUT I TOLD THEM
YOU WEREN'T HERE.

02:31.285 --> 02:33.321
DID THEY LEAVE?
NO.

02:33.354 --> 02:34.322
OH, NO! NO! NO!

02:34.355 --> 02:35.022
WAIT, WHAT GUYS?

02:35.055 --> 02:38.759
NO! AAH!
OH, THIS IS NOT GOOD.

02:38.792 --> 02:39.660
SEAN, WHAT
IS GOING ON?

02:39.693 --> 02:44.765
UH...I MAY
HAVE SCREWED UP
JUST A LITTLE.

02:45.866 --> 02:47.735
DID YOU DO SOMETHING
AT THE PLANETARIUM?

02:47.768 --> 02:51.572
UH...I DIDN'T
ACTUALLY MAKE IT
TO THE PLANETARIUM.

02:51.605 --> 02:53.674
YOU LOOK UP AND YOU
SEE ALL THESE STARS.

02:53.707 --> 02:55.409
CAN'T YOU JUST
DO THAT OUTSIDE?

02:55.443 --> 02:57.711
YEAH, BUT THIS IS INSIDE
AND IT'S DURING THE DAY.

02:57.745 --> 02:58.612
IT'S GOING
TO BE FANTASTIC.

02:58.646 --> 03:00.781
HEY, HEY, HEY.
GUESS WHO LANDED
4 TICKETS

03:00.814 --> 03:02.650
TO TODAY'S YANKEE
GAME? FRONT ROW.

03:02.683 --> 03:03.817
NO, UH-UH-UH-UH.
LET ME SEE.

03:03.851 --> 03:06.620
WHOO! FORGET
THE PLANETARIUM. WE'RE
GOING TO THE YANKEES.

03:06.654 --> 03:07.988
Eddie: ALL RIGHT!
MERRY CHRISTMAS.

03:08.021 --> 03:12.826
BUT JIMMY HATES BASEBALL
EVER SINCE HE SAW
FIELD OF DREAMS.

03:12.860 --> 03:15.729
I HATE BASEBALL, DAD.
IT MAKES ME THINK
OF GHOSTS.

03:15.763 --> 03:19.833
COME ON, JIMMY, WE'VE
BEEN OVER THIS. THAT WASN'T
THE POINT OF THE MOVIE.

03:19.867 --> 03:20.701
IT'S NOT A HORROR MOVIE.

03:20.734 --> 03:24.272
BUT THERE WERE GHOSTS!
HUNDREDS OF THEM,

03:24.305 --> 03:25.739
COMING OUT
OF THE CORN FIELD.

03:25.773 --> 03:27.708
I KNOW, BUT THEY JUST
WANTED TO PLAY CATCH.

03:27.741 --> 03:28.709
BUT THEY WERE DEAD!

03:28.742 --> 03:31.779
YEAH, BUT I THINK I MAY
HAVE TURNED HIM AROUND.

03:31.812 --> 03:35.516
SO, YOU'RE SURE
THAT BABE RUTH IS
NOT BURIED OVER THERE?

03:35.549 --> 03:39.420
JIMMY, IT'S A MONUMENT.
IT'S NOT A TOMBSTONE.

03:42.890 --> 03:44.725
WELL, HOW ABOUT THESE
FRONT

03:44.758 --> 03:45.659
WHO'S BETTER
THAN ME, HUH?

03:45.693 --> 03:48.028
COME ON, WE'RE IN
THE RIGHT-FIELD BLEACHERS.

03:48.061 --> 03:49.397
FRONT ROW.

03:49.430 --> 03:52.700
LOOK, FROM HERE,
THE BATTER LOOKS LIKE
A DWARF SWINGING A TURKEY LEG.

03:52.733 --> 03:53.734
HERE YOU GO, JIMMY.

03:53.767 --> 03:56.504
HEY, NUMBER 68,
YOU SUCK!

03:56.537 --> 03:59.940
DAD? ARE WE ALLOWED
TO TELL THAT MAN
HE SUCKS?

03:59.973 --> 04:03.811
SURE, THAT'S
WHAT BEING A FAN
IS ALL ABOUT.

04:04.878 --> 04:07.481
HEY! YOU SUCK!

04:07.515 --> 04:09.350
YOU SUCK!
THIS IS FUN.

04:09.383 --> 04:11.985
HEY, 75, YOU SUCK, TOO!

04:12.019 --> 04:14.622
THIS HOT DOG SUCKS!

04:14.655 --> 04:15.723
THESE SEATS SUCK!

04:15.756 --> 04:16.990
THAT AIRPLANE SUCKS!

04:17.024 --> 04:18.859
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,
ALL RIGHT! COME ON,
ENOUGH OF THE SUCK.

04:18.892 --> 04:21.329
COME ON, SIT DOWN.

04:21.362 --> 04:22.262
WHOO!

04:22.296 --> 04:23.030
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU
STILL BRING THAT THING.

04:23.063 --> 04:24.632
YOU'RE NEVER
GOING TO CATCH A BALL.

04:24.665 --> 04:25.666
IT'S POSSIBLE.

04:25.699 --> 04:28.869
YEAH, RIGHT.
DUDE, YOUR RECORD
IS LIKE 0 FOR 100.

04:30.771 --> 04:32.806
I GOT IT!

04:33.507 --> 04:35.042
I GOT IT!

04:35.709 --> 04:36.910
I GOT IT!

04:36.944 --> 04:41.449
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
NO. TODAY IS MY LUCKY DAY.

04:41.482 --> 04:43.817
I CAN FEEL IT.

04:43.851 --> 04:45.619
YANKEES!

04:49.857 --> 04:50.824
YOU SUCK!

04:50.858 --> 04:52.526
AH, AH!
HENRY, NOT DURING
THE ANTHEM, PLEASE.

04:52.560 --> 04:53.394
* OH, SAY CAN--

04:53.427 --> 04:55.028
SEAN, YOU BEING HERE
TONIGHT, THAT SUCKS.

04:55.062 --> 04:58.031
YEAH, WELL,
MY NIGHT SUCKED, TOO.
BELIEVE YOU ME.

04:58.065 --> 05:00.968
OH, NO.

05:02.135 --> 05:05.373
A TADPOLE
LOOKS LIKE A FISH,
BUT IT'S NOT A FISH.

05:05.406 --> 05:08.876
NOW, YOU MIGHT THINK
IT'S A FISH BECAUSE
IT DOESN'T HAVE LEGS,

05:08.909 --> 05:11.712
BUT IT WILL HAVE LEGS,
AND THEN YOU'LL KNOW
IT'S A FROG.

05:11.745 --> 05:15.082
IN THE MEANTIME, YOU'LL
JUST HAVE TO TRUST ME.

05:15.583 --> 05:17.618
THIS IS
A BACHELORETTE PARTY.

05:17.651 --> 05:20.954
WE ARE NOT TALKING
ABOUT TADPOLES.

05:23.924 --> 05:26.594
MOM, THIS BABY
WILL NOT SHUT UP!

05:26.627 --> 05:28.362
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
WHOSE BABY IS THAT?

05:28.396 --> 05:29.863
OH, GOOD, YOU'RE HOME.
YOU TAKE IT.

05:29.897 --> 05:31.499
NO. YOUR FATHER
IS ON HIS WAY OUT.

05:31.532 --> 05:35.002
MOM, BRAD AND I REALLY
NEED TO CALM OUR NERVES

05:35.035 --> 05:37.438
AT--AT THE MOVIES.

05:39.039 --> 05:40.808
IT'S OK, BABY.
IT'S OK.

05:40.841 --> 05:43.110
WE'RE COOL, LILY.
WE'RE COOL.

05:43.143 --> 05:44.211
OH, GREAT.

05:44.244 --> 05:47.515
HEY, SEAN.
THAT CROWD OUTSIDE
IS LOOKING REALLY UPSET.

05:47.548 --> 05:49.016
YOU COOL WITH ME
SLEEPING HERE TONIGHT
OR WHAT?

05:49.049 --> 05:53.120
NO, YOU
CANNOT SLEEP HERE.
YOU CAN'T STAY HERE!

05:53.153 --> 05:55.155
I WAS ASKING SEAN.

05:55.188 --> 05:56.824
LOOK, YOU PROMISED ME
ONE NIGHT.

05:56.857 --> 05:58.992
I WANTED ONE NIGHT.
I WANT MY NIGHT!

05:59.026 --> 06:00.127
BUT THOSE PEOPLE
OUTSIDE!

06:00.160 --> 06:02.029
WHO ARE THOSE PEOPLE?
WHY ARE THEY THERE?

06:02.062 --> 06:04.965
UH...WELL, OK, IT'S
THE BOTTOM OF THE NINTH,

06:04.998 --> 06:09.870
AND THE YANKS ARE UP
BY A RUN, AND WE'RE
FEELING PRETTY GOOD.

06:13.006 --> 06:14.174
YEAH, COME ON, YANKS!

06:14.207 --> 06:16.844
ONE MORE OUT, YANKEES!
ONE MORE OUT!

06:16.877 --> 06:18.646
ALL RIGHT.
LET'S GET OUTTA HERE.

06:18.679 --> 06:20.848
WHAT, ARE YOU CRAZY?
COME ON, WE'RE CLINGING
TO A ONE-RUN LEAD,

06:20.881 --> 06:22.115
THERE'S A MAN ON SECOND,
THERE'S 2 OUTS,

06:22.149 --> 06:23.116
THERE'S NO WAY
I'M LEAVING.

06:23.150 --> 06:24.985
COME ON.
IF WE GET A JUMP
ON ALL THE OTHER CARS,

06:25.018 --> 06:26.820
I KNOW A GUY WHO'LL PULL
A CHAIN DOWN FOR US.

06:26.854 --> 06:29.757
AAH! NO, NO, NO.
I'M NOT LEAVING
THE GAME EARLY. NO WAY!

06:29.790 --> 06:30.724
YEAH, ME NEITHER.

06:30.758 --> 06:32.626
THAT'S MY BOY!
LET'S GO!

06:41.201 --> 06:44.705
I GOT IT! I GOT IT!
I GOT IT!

06:44.738 --> 06:47.040
OH, MY GOD!
YOU FINALLY CAUGHT ONE!

06:47.074 --> 06:47.775
GOOD FOR YOU.

06:47.808 --> 06:48.976
NO, NO, NO, NO.
NOT GOOD FOR ME.

06:49.009 --> 06:50.911
THE BALL
WAS STILL IN PLAY.

06:50.944 --> 06:51.812
SO?

06:51.845 --> 06:53.881
SO IF THE RIGHT FIELDER
CATCHES THE BALL,

06:53.914 --> 06:54.948
THE YANKS WIN THE GAME,

06:54.982 --> 06:58.051
BUT SINCE SEAN FINNERTY
CAUGHT THE BALL, THEY LOST.

06:58.085 --> 06:59.487
I--I GOT IT! I GOT IT!

06:59.520 --> 07:02.055
BOO!
BOO!
BOO!

07:02.089 --> 07:03.056
WHAT?

07:03.090 --> 07:03.791
NICE GOIN', IDIOT!

07:03.824 --> 07:06.594
WHY DIDN'T YOU
LET HIM CATCH IT?

07:06.627 --> 07:07.861
I--UGH!

07:07.895 --> 07:08.596
I DIDN'T--

07:08.629 --> 07:10.831
I DIDN'T MEAN TO,
RIGHT, EDDIE?

07:10.864 --> 07:12.766
WHY ARE YOU
TALKIN' TO ME, MAN?

07:12.800 --> 07:14.001
I DON'T--
I DON'T KNOW YOU,

07:14.034 --> 07:16.770
AND MY NAME'S
MAURICE.

07:20.641 --> 07:23.511
I'M SORRY!

07:25.112 --> 07:25.979
FINNERTY!

07:26.013 --> 07:29.049
COME OUT! YOU CAN'T
STAY IN THERE FOREVER!

07:29.082 --> 07:31.752
BOY, THEY REALLY
WANT TO HURT YOU.

07:31.785 --> 07:35.055
AND I'D REALLY
RATHER NOT LET THEM.

07:35.088 --> 07:36.990
MOM, IS THERE
ANY MILK?

07:37.024 --> 07:38.992
WAIT, WHAT
ARE YOU EATING?

07:39.026 --> 07:40.994
IT'S THE CAKE
IN THERE.

07:41.028 --> 07:43.597
THE ONE SHAPED
LIKE A LIGHTHOUSE.

07:44.097 --> 07:46.700
THAT CAKE WAS FOR
THE BACHELORETTE PARTY.

07:46.734 --> 07:49.236
HOW MUCH OF
THE...LIGHTHOUSE
DID YOU EAT?

07:49.269 --> 07:54.642
UGH. NO MAN LIKES
TO SEE THAT HAPPEN
TO A LIGHTHOUSE.

07:54.675 --> 07:55.943
OK, YOU KNOW WHAT?

07:55.976 --> 07:57.077
YOU TWO UPSTAIRS NOW.

07:57.110 --> 07:59.046
WHAT? WHY ARE WE
BEING PUNISHED?

07:59.079 --> 08:00.113
YOU'RE NOT
BEING PUNISHED.

08:00.147 --> 08:01.114
GO, AND
THEN TOMORROW,

08:01.148 --> 08:02.583
YOU CAN DO
SOMETHING REALLY BAD

08:02.616 --> 08:03.984
AND YOU GET AWAY
WITH IT.

08:04.017 --> 08:04.652
OK.

08:04.685 --> 08:07.054
I'M GONNA PLAY
WITH MATCHES.

08:07.087 --> 08:08.989
OK, NOT THAT.

08:09.022 --> 08:11.024
MOM, FAYE'S KID
REALLY STINKS.

08:11.058 --> 08:12.893
SHE PROBABLY NEEDS
HER DIAPER CHANGED.

08:12.926 --> 08:15.095
WELL, YEAH, THAT'S
WHAT I'M THINKIN'.

08:15.128 --> 08:16.830
CHANGE HER DIAPER.

08:16.864 --> 08:19.567
HOW ABOUT I DUMP
SOME POTPOURRI
DOWN THERE?

08:19.600 --> 08:21.201
CHANGE IT.

08:21.234 --> 08:23.036
BABY.

08:23.070 --> 08:25.773
I KEEP TELLING
JIMMY AND HENRY

08:25.806 --> 08:30.744
TO LEAVE THEIR STUPID
STUFFED ANIMALS OUT OF HERE.

08:31.779 --> 08:33.547
CAN YOU BELIEVE
MY MOM,

08:33.581 --> 08:37.851
MAKING US STAY
UP HERE IN MY BEDROOM
PRETTY MUCH ALONE?

08:37.885 --> 08:40.320
I DON'T KNOW.
IT'S NOT SO BAD.

08:40.353 --> 08:43.223
I'M NOT SAYING
IT'S BAD.

08:43.256 --> 08:46.860
I MEAN,
I-I'M COOL WITH IT...

08:46.894 --> 08:47.961
IF YOU ARE.

08:47.995 --> 08:51.765
YEAH, I'M TOTALLY
COOL WITH IT.

08:56.870 --> 08:58.238
BABY.

08:58.271 --> 09:00.841
YOU DIDN'T LIKE
THOSE CARROTS?

09:00.874 --> 09:03.210
COME OUT
AND FACE THE MUSIC!

09:03.243 --> 09:04.011
WHAT IS GOING ON?

09:04.044 --> 09:05.779
THERE'S, LIKE,
15 GUYS OUT THERE NOW.

09:05.813 --> 09:07.781
THEY'RE PUTTING BEER CANS
ALL OVER MY CAR.

09:07.815 --> 09:09.116
OH, GOOD. IF THEY'RE
DRINKIN' BEER,

09:09.149 --> 09:10.350
THAT MEANS THEY'RE
GONNA HAVE TO LEAVE

09:10.383 --> 09:13.120
TO GO USE
THE BATHROOM.

09:13.153 --> 09:15.956
NO. APPARENTLY NOT.

09:21.228 --> 09:22.195
WHAT DO YOU WANT?!

09:22.229 --> 09:25.098
IT'S YOUR FATHER!

09:28.235 --> 09:30.103
QUITE A CROWD
OUT THERE, SEANY.

09:30.137 --> 09:31.171
WELL, UH, WHAT, UH--

09:31.204 --> 09:34.274
SO WHAT HAPPENED
TODAY IN THE GAME?
THE YANKEES WIN?

09:34.307 --> 09:35.242
YOU DIDN'T SEE IT?

09:35.275 --> 09:37.344
OF COURSE I SAW IT.

09:37.377 --> 09:40.113
I'LL SEE IT EVERY TIME
I CLOSE MY EYES.

09:40.147 --> 09:42.650
Walt: YEAH, ALL RIGHT.
GREAT PLAY.

09:42.683 --> 09:44.852
YEAH, ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT.

09:44.885 --> 09:45.719
ONE MORE OUT.

09:45.753 --> 09:46.620
THOSE ARE MY YANKEES.

09:46.654 --> 09:48.021
TV: SWUNG ON AND HIT DEEP
TO RIGHT FIELD.

09:48.055 --> 09:49.256
IT'S WAY BACK THERE.

09:49.289 --> 09:51.258
IT'S NOT. HE'LL GET IT,
HE'LL GET IT.

09:51.291 --> 09:53.060
O'NEILL IS AT THE FENCE
AND...OH, MY!

09:53.093 --> 09:54.728
IT LOOKS LIKE A FAN
TOOK IT AWAY FROM HIM!

09:54.762 --> 09:55.595
CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT?

09:55.629 --> 09:56.329
AND THE UMPIRE IS
RULING IT A HOME RUN.

09:56.363 --> 09:57.998
THE RED SOX
HAVE TAKEN THE LEAD.

09:58.031 --> 09:58.932
NO, NO!

09:58.966 --> 10:01.034
SOME IDIOT GRABBED IT.
THAT IDIOT GRABBED IT.

10:01.068 --> 10:05.272
HEY, FINNERTY.
THAT IDIOT LOOKS
LIKE YOUR SON.

10:06.173 --> 10:09.142
WHAT? NO.
NO, IT DOESN'T.

10:09.176 --> 10:11.311
YEAH, HE LOOKS
LIKE YOUR SON.

10:11.344 --> 10:13.080
NO, NOTHIN' LIKE HIM.

10:13.113 --> 10:14.915
I'M SORRY!

10:14.948 --> 10:17.250
I'M PRETTY SURE
THAT'S YOUR SON.

10:17.284 --> 10:19.853
I HAVE NO SON.

10:20.754 --> 10:23.223
AND I WANTED YOU TO HAVE
MY STOOL AT THE ALPINE

10:23.256 --> 10:24.391
AFTER I PASSED,

10:24.424 --> 10:28.261
BUT YOU SHOT
THAT DREAM TO HELL.

10:31.464 --> 10:32.700
CLAUDIA?
MM

10:32.733 --> 10:34.735
UM, I DON'T WANT
TO BE A JERK,

10:34.768 --> 10:35.602
BUT ARE THESE GUYS
STAYING?

10:35.635 --> 10:37.270
BECAUSE THEY'RE KIND
OF KILLING THE MOOD.

10:37.304 --> 10:38.438
NO, THEY'RE LEAVING.
RIGHT NOW.

10:38.471 --> 10:41.008
I--HEY, THAT MOB
IS TRYING TO KILL ME!

10:41.041 --> 10:43.210
CAN'T YOU JUST SNEAK
OVER THE BACK FENCE

10:43.243 --> 10:44.377
AND AVOID THE MOB?

10:44.411 --> 10:46.914
THERE ARE OTHER MOBS.

10:46.947 --> 10:49.082
Henry: WHY ARE WE
WALKING SO FAST?

10:49.116 --> 10:51.151
I WANT SOME PEANUTS
AND CRACKER JACKS.

10:51.184 --> 10:52.285
DON'T BE SUCH
A CLICHÉ, HENRY.

10:52.319 --> 10:53.220
THAT ANNOYS ME.

10:53.253 --> 10:54.855
NICE GOING, JACKASS.

10:54.888 --> 10:56.356
Jimmy: DAD,
WHY DON'T YOU JUST
THROW THAT BALL AWAY?

10:56.389 --> 10:58.325
ARE YOU KIDDING? IT'S
A GENUINE YANKEE BASEBALL.

10:58.358 --> 11:00.327
HEY, DUMB ASS,
ARE YOU FROM BOSTON,

11:00.360 --> 11:01.428
OR ARE YOU
JUST A DUMB ASS?

11:01.461 --> 11:03.296
HEY, I JUST WANTED TO CATCH
A BALL FOR MY LITTLE BOY.

11:03.330 --> 11:04.064
IS THAT SUCH A CRIME?

11:04.097 --> 11:05.999
Jimmy: WHAT?
I DIDN'T WANT A BALL.

11:06.033 --> 11:07.868
YES, YOU DID, JIMMY.

11:07.901 --> 11:10.303
LET'S JUST
GET TO THE CAR.

11:10.503 --> 11:15.108
DAD, THOSE GUYS
LOOK LIKE THEY'RE
REALLY MAD AT US.

11:16.076 --> 11:18.245
THEY'RE GOING TO KILL US.
NO QUESTION ABOUT IT.

11:18.278 --> 11:19.847
ALL RIGHT,
WHAT'S THE MOVE, CAPPY?

11:19.880 --> 11:21.348
OK, GUYS,
ON 3 WE BOLT.

11:21.381 --> 11:22.382
GOT IT.
READY?

11:22.415 --> 11:26.219
ONE...OH,
THANKS, EDDIE!

11:26.253 --> 11:28.221
YOU LEFT OUR CAR
AT YANKEE STADIUM?

11:28.255 --> 11:29.356
I-IT SHOULD
BE SAFE.

11:29.389 --> 11:30.891
OVERNIGHT?
IN THE BRONX?

11:30.924 --> 11:34.394
LOOK, IT WAS A CAR
OR US. I CHOSE US.

11:37.430 --> 11:42.302
DAD...PEOPLE
ARE LOOKING AT US.

11:42.335 --> 11:44.404
UH, WE'RE HANDSOME
GUYS, HENRY,

11:44.437 --> 11:47.140
AND THAT'S WHAT
HAPPENS, SO...

11:47.174 --> 11:47.941
GET USED TO IT.

11:47.975 --> 11:52.379
I NEVER REALIZED
HOW HANDSOME
I WAS.

11:55.048 --> 11:57.184
THOSE GUYS DEFINITELY
RECOGNIZE ME.

11:57.217 --> 11:59.286
GIVE THEM
THE CRAZY LOOK, THEN.

11:59.319 --> 12:01.121
LIKE WHAT?

12:04.124 --> 12:06.326
OH...OK.

12:13.967 --> 12:16.136
I'M SORRY.

12:16.169 --> 12:18.271
DON'T YOU SMILE
AT ME, YOU BASTARD.

12:18.305 --> 12:21.408
YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO COST THE YANKEES
THE GAME TODAY.

12:21.441 --> 12:22.409
YOU JERK!

12:22.442 --> 12:25.278
HEY, HEY, HEY!
NO, I, UM...

12:25.312 --> 12:27.781
I JUST WANTED
TO CATCH A BALL

12:27.815 --> 12:29.783
AND GIVE IT
TO MY LITTLE BOY.

12:29.817 --> 12:33.420
DAD, AGAIN,
I DIDN'T WANT A BALL.

12:35.388 --> 12:36.323
UH...UM...

12:36.356 --> 12:37.590
HEY, LOOK, GUYS.
COME ON,

12:37.624 --> 12:39.126
THERE'S SOME EMPTY SEATS
ON THE OTHER CAR.
LET'S GO. LET'S GO.

12:39.159 --> 12:40.961
BUT WE HAVE SEATS
IN THIS CAR.

12:40.994 --> 12:42.462
NO, WE DON'T.

12:47.901 --> 12:51.171
AHH. OH, THIS IS
SO MUCH BETTER.

12:51.204 --> 12:53.473
Conductor: THIS TRAIN WILL
MAKE EXPRESS STOPS ONLY

12:53.506 --> 12:57.344
BETWEEN 125th AND 42nd
STREETS. EXPRESS STOPS ONLY.

12:57.377 --> 12:58.545
AH, BEAUTIFUL.

12:58.578 --> 13:00.280
Conductor: ALSO
IN THE NUMBER 3 CAR,

13:00.313 --> 13:03.350
IT'S THAT MORON WHO MADE
THE YANKEES LOSE TODAY.

13:03.383 --> 13:05.552
DAD...
UH...

13:05.953 --> 13:10.423
D-DON'T WORRY, SON.
JUST SIT BACK AND WATCH.

13:14.061 --> 13:17.464
HYAAAAAH!

13:17.497 --> 13:19.166
YOU WANT THE BUTTERFLY?

13:19.199 --> 13:20.500
YOU WANT
THE BUTTERFLY, HUH?

13:20.533 --> 13:21.501
HUH

13:21.534 --> 13:25.505
'CAUSE I'M READY

13:28.208 --> 13:29.476
UH...

13:30.143 --> 13:33.213

13:41.321 --> 13:42.923
COME ON, GUYS!

13:44.224 --> 13:48.328
JIMMY! HENRY! EDDIE!

13:48.595 --> 13:51.131
DAD, UM, DO YOU KNOW
WHERE WE'RE GOING?

13:51.164 --> 13:52.966
UH, DON'T WORRY,
JIMMY, RELAX.

13:53.000 --> 13:56.436
REMEMBER I WORK DOWN
HERE. IT'S JUST LIKE
MY OFFICE, SO, UH...

13:56.469 --> 13:58.138
WE'RE GOING DOWN
TO THE N-R LINE,

13:58.171 --> 13:59.006
THAT'S GOING
TO TAKE US INTO QUEENS.

13:59.039 --> 14:01.508
AND THAT'S METS
TERRITORY. WE'LL BE OK.

14:01.541 --> 14:04.377
I'VE GOT TO GO.
IS THERE A BATHROOM
DOWN HERE?

14:04.411 --> 14:06.546
OH, HENRY,
LOOK AT THIS PLACE.

14:06.579 --> 14:08.448
THE WHOLE THING'S
A BATHROOM.

14:08.481 --> 14:10.083
HEY, HEY, IT'S MY OFFICE.

14:10.117 --> 14:11.351
DAD!

14:11.384 --> 14:12.185
OK, GO AHEAD.

14:12.219 --> 14:14.387
I'M AIMING
FOR THAT RAT.

14:14.421 --> 14:17.424
JUST DON'T HIT
THE THIRD RAIL, MAN.

14:17.457 --> 14:19.492
YOU WALKED OUR KIDS
ALONG THE THIRD RAIL?

14:19.526 --> 14:21.628
NO, WE WERE NOWHERE
NEAR THE THIRD RAIL.

14:21.661 --> 14:23.931
WE WERE ON THE LEDGE,

14:23.964 --> 14:25.565
THE SAFETY LEDGE.

14:28.368 --> 14:28.936
WHO IS IT?!

14:28.969 --> 14:30.603
IT'S THE POLICE!
OPEN UP!

14:30.637 --> 14:32.105
OH, THANK GOD!

14:32.139 --> 14:33.406
HI, OFFICER.
THANK GOD YOU'RE HERE.

14:33.440 --> 14:37.144
THAT MOB OUTSIDE, THERE
WAS 8. NOW THERE'S 20.
THEY'RE GOING CR--

14:37.177 --> 14:38.211
SHH.

14:38.245 --> 14:41.481
THERE'S BEEN A COMPLAINT
ABOUT SOMEONE IN THIS HOUSE.

14:41.514 --> 14:43.150
EXCUSE ME?

14:43.450 --> 14:46.553
I'M AFRAID I MAY
HAVE TO USE THESE.

14:46.586 --> 14:48.021
WHY?

15:19.152 --> 15:22.956
I'D GET THIS GUY'S
BADGE NUMBER.

15:24.657 --> 15:27.027
Baby.

15:37.104 --> 15:38.338
HMM.

15:38.371 --> 15:39.306
WHAT?

15:39.339 --> 15:41.174
NOTHING.

15:50.417 --> 15:53.420
OH, DID THEY WAKE
YOU UP, LITTLE LADY?

15:56.656 --> 15:58.091
WHAT IS ALL THE WHOOING?

15:58.125 --> 16:02.062

16:04.464 --> 16:06.566
OH, THERE IS NOTHING
FOR ME UPSTAIRS.

16:06.599 --> 16:08.001
GO ON!
YOUNG LADY, COME ON.

16:08.035 --> 16:09.136
I LOVE YOU!
GO!

16:09.169 --> 16:11.271
GO!

16:15.442 --> 16:17.044
WERE YOU AT
THE YANKEE GAME TODAY?

16:17.077 --> 16:18.078
OH, GOD.
OH, HEY, MAN,

16:18.111 --> 16:20.047
IT WAS LIKE--

THINGS WHERE--

16:20.080 --> 16:22.515
PLEASE KEEP DANCING,

16:22.549 --> 16:24.151

16:24.184 --> 16:25.618
GET OUT OF MY HOUSE,

16:25.652 --> 16:26.619

16:29.722 --> 16:31.358
OUT! GO!
YOU GO! YOU STAY!

16:31.391 --> 16:34.661
I'LL DANCE, I'LL DANCE.
COME ON.

16:36.129 --> 16:38.598
STOP DANCING.
WHAT?

16:38.631 --> 16:39.766
I DON'T KNOW
WHERE I'M GOING.

16:39.799 --> 16:40.833
CLAUD, LISTEN, ALL RIGHT?

16:40.867 --> 16:44.537
W-W-WE WE'RE KICKED OUT
OF 5 CABS AND 2 RESTAURANTS.

16:44.571 --> 16:45.738
THEY WOULDN'T EVEN
LET US ON THE BUS.

16:45.772 --> 16:47.574
WE WALKED ALL THE WAY
ACROSS THE VERRAZANO
NARROWS BRIDGE!

16:47.607 --> 16:50.443
THAT'S THE SIXTH LONGEST
SUSPENSION BRIDGE
IN THE WORLD!

16:50.477 --> 16:53.080
WE JUST WANTED
TO GET HOME.

16:54.447 --> 16:56.749
JUST ONE MORE
BLOCK, HENRY.

16:57.150 --> 16:58.285
CAN'T YOU SMELL
THE DUMP?

16:58.318 --> 17:01.521
IT NEVER SMELLED
SO SWEET.

17:03.156 --> 17:05.125
HEY, GEORGE!

17:22.609 --> 17:24.111
IT'S FINNERTY! HEY!

17:24.144 --> 17:26.446

17:26.479 --> 17:29.816
COME ON! COME ON!
COME ON! LOSER!

17:32.585 --> 17:34.221
WHAT NOW, DAD?

17:35.322 --> 17:39.359
SOMETHING A MAN HAS TO DO
WHEN HE CAN'T RUN NO MORE.

17:39.626 --> 17:41.761
SNEAK AROUND BACK!

17:41.794 --> 17:43.230
SO, YOU SEE, CLAUDIA,

17:43.263 --> 17:45.298
THIS IS THE ONLY PLACE
IN NEW YORK CITY

17:45.332 --> 17:46.733
WHERE NOBODY
WANTS TO KILL ME.

17:46.766 --> 17:48.735
OH, YEAH?
GUESS AGAIN.

17:49.669 --> 17:52.405
OH, WOW! HA HA HA!

17:52.439 --> 17:54.674
THAT IS GOING
TO DRIVE JERRY WILD.

17:54.707 --> 17:56.876
I CAN'T WEAR THIS.

17:56.909 --> 17:58.645
TRY IT ON.

18:00.347 --> 18:02.249
NO, JUST TO SEE
IF IT FITS.

18:03.416 --> 18:04.751
I-IT'S CROTCHLESS.

18:04.784 --> 18:10.590
YEAH. YOU KNOW, JUST
TO SEE IF IT'S NOT TOO BIG
AROUND THE SHOULDERS.

18:10.623 --> 18:11.791
WALT, WHAT ARE
YOU EATING?

18:11.824 --> 18:14.127
FRUIT ROLL-UP.
THEY'RE NOT BAD.

18:14.161 --> 18:16.696
THOSE ARE
EDIBLE PANTIES.

18:16.729 --> 18:17.797
WHAT?

18:17.830 --> 18:21.468
OH, DEAR GOD.
I'VE GOT TO GO

18:21.501 --> 18:22.402
OK, THAT'LL DO IT.

18:22.435 --> 18:23.370
YEAH, YOU KNOW, LET'S

18:30.310 --> 18:31.478
IT'S GIRL NIGHT.

18:31.511 --> 18:33.246
WE STILL HAVE
TO MAKE A WEDDING DRESS
OUT OF TOILET PAPER.

18:33.280 --> 18:35.648
THAT'S FUN, RIGHT?
COME ON.

18:36.483 --> 18:37.884

I GOTTA GO OUT THERE.

18:39.686 --> 18:40.687

WE CAN'T GO OUT UNTIL
I FACE THEM, SO I GOTTA GO.

18:42.822 --> 18:45.225
THEY WANT
TO KICK YOUR ASS.

18:45.258 --> 18:47.594

18:47.627 --> 18:49.329

OF A BEAUTIFUL DAY.

19:11.218 --> 19:13.953

TO THEIR FIRST YANKEE GAME.

19:13.986 --> 19:16.823
AND MY WIFE'S
THROWING A GREAT PARTY.

19:16.856 --> 19:18.658
AND AFTER ALL THESE YEARS
AT YANKEE STADIUM,

19:18.691 --> 19:19.759
I FINALLY CAUGHT A BALL.

19:19.792 --> 19:21.694
WE KNOW!
I SAW IT!

19:21.728 --> 19:23.696
I KNOW,
B-BUT I ENDED UP...

19:23.730 --> 19:27.900
BETRAYING ALL THE THINGS
THAT I HOLD DEAR.

19:27.934 --> 19:31.538
M-MY TEAM LOSES.
MY SONS HATE BASEBALL.

19:31.571 --> 19:34.541
MY WIFE HATES ME,
SO GO AHEAD.

19:34.574 --> 19:36.343
DO YOUR BEST.
TAKE YOUR BEST SHOT.

19:36.376 --> 19:41.581
BECAUSE YOU PEOPLE
CAN'T HURT ME ANY MORE
THAN I'VE HURT MYSELF.

19:44.917 --> 19:45.818
DAN--

19:45.852 --> 19:47.754
GOD!

19:47.787 --> 19:49.522
NICE CATCH, MORON!

19:53.626 --> 19:54.661
HEY, WHERE
ARE THEY GOING?

19:54.694 --> 19:55.528
I WAS LIKE
2 SECONDS AWAY

19:55.562 --> 19:59.232
FROM GOING OLD TESTAMENT
ON THEIR ASSES.

19:59.266 --> 20:00.333
YOU ALL RIGHT?

20:08.508 --> 20:09.842
WHAT DID YOU DO?

20:09.876 --> 20:13.012
I JUST GOT
MY BUTT KICKED.

20:13.045 --> 20:13.913
SEAN.

20:13.946 --> 20:15.147
THERE WAS
SO MANY OF THEM.

20:15.181 --> 20:17.484
I TOOK OUT 3 OR 4,
BUT THIS ONE GUY
GOT ME FROM BEHIND AND...

20:17.517 --> 20:19.519
THE POINT IS, BABY,
I DID IT FOR YOU.

20:19.552 --> 20:22.855
NOW I'M GONNA GRAB
THE LITTLE GUYS, AND
WE'RE GONNA HEAD OUT.

20:22.889 --> 20:24.691
I'LL GO GET 'EM, MAN.

20:24.724 --> 20:27.494
HEY! JIMMY, HENRY!

20:28.328 --> 20:30.997
OH, THAT WAS
KIND OF BRAVE.
OW...

20:31.030 --> 20:33.766
OF COURSE, YOU COULD
HAVE DONE THAT
A HALF HOUR AGO.

20:33.800 --> 20:35.902
I DON'T THINK
WE CAN STILL
SALVAGE THIS THING.

20:35.935 --> 20:37.437
I, UM, FORGOT
MY HANDCUFFS.

20:37.470 --> 20:40.773
OH, YES, YOU'RE NOT
GOING ANYWHERE, OFFICER.

20:40.807 --> 20:42.041
UH, YEAH,
WE PAID A DEPOSIT.

20:42.074 --> 20:44.911
GET OVER THERE
AND TAKE OFF
YOUR PANTS.

20:44.944 --> 20:46.879
IS HE LEAVING?

20:46.913 --> 20:48.047
YES, YES, HE IS.

20:48.080 --> 20:48.848
I'M LEAVING.

20:48.881 --> 20:51.918
COME ON, GUYS!

20:54.487 --> 20:57.424
MOM, WHAT'S
THAT POLICEMAN DOING?

20:57.457 --> 20:59.592
BYE-BYE!

21:04.964 --> 21:06.899
OH, HEY, JIMMY,
JUST A SEC.

21:06.933 --> 21:11.471
LOOK, I KNOW
I GOT THIS THING
IN A SCREWED-UP WAY,

21:11.504 --> 21:14.441
BUT IT IS A GENUINE
YANKEE BASEBALL.

21:14.474 --> 21:16.709
AND THE ONE THAT
COST THEM THE GAME.

21:16.743 --> 21:19.546
YEAH, BUT IT WAS
AN UNBELIEVABLE CATCH.

21:19.579 --> 21:21.914
YEAH.

21:22.449 --> 21:23.916
WELL, THE POINT IS, UH...

21:23.950 --> 21:27.754
MY WHOLE LIFE
I WANTED ONE OF THESE.

21:29.021 --> 21:31.791
BUT NOW I WANT
TO GIVE IT TO YOU.

21:36.996 --> 21:39.766
I GUESS
IT'S KIND OF COOL.

21:43.002 --> 21:44.571
THANKS, DAD.

21:46.473 --> 21:47.607
HEY, HENRY, CATCH!

21:47.640 --> 21:49.876
OH, NO, JIMMY!
IT'S NOT A TOY.
DON'T PLAY CATCH WITH IT.

21:49.909 --> 21:51.344
IT BELONGS
ON THE MANTEL!

21:51.378 --> 21:53.813
UH, HENRY!
NO, PUT IT DOWN!

21:53.846 --> 21:55.882
OH, NO, IT'S GOING
IN THE STORM DRAIN!

21:58.718 --> 21:59.919
I WENT ALL THE WAY
TO THE EROTIC BAKERY

21:59.952 --> 22:01.788
AND SPENT A FORTUNE
ON THIS CAKE, AND THEY
BARELY TOUCHED IT.

22:01.821 --> 22:04.424
WELL, MOST OF YOUR FRIENDS
ARE MARRIED NOW,

22:04.457 --> 22:07.927
AND THEY'RE NOT AS EXCITED
ABOUT CAKE AS THEY USED TO BE.

22:07.960 --> 22:09.929
WELL, I ENJOY
A GOOD CAKE.

22:09.962 --> 22:11.431
ARE YOU HUNGRY NOW?

22:12.432 --> 22:13.933
WELL, I'M OFF
TO THE ALPINE

22:13.966 --> 22:15.835
TO SEE IF I STILL
HAVE ANY FRIENDS.

22:15.868 --> 22:19.672
HEY, UM, WHY DON'T YOU
TAKE THIS CAKE OVER THERE?

22:19.706 --> 22:20.607
IT'S DELICIOUS.

22:20.640 --> 22:21.574
REALLY? THAT'S NICE.

22:21.608 --> 22:24.611
THIS'LL REALLY GET ME
IN GOOD WITH THE FELLAS.

22:24.644 --> 22:26.012
YEAH, THE GUYS'LL
LOVE IT.

22:26.045 --> 22:27.647
YEAH. THANKS.
