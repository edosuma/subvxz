00:02.437 --> 00:05.005
Previously onCharmed...HARRY: It's a powerful
history rewriting spell.

00:05.048 --> 00:06.963
MEL:
To make it as if Niko
and I never met.

00:08.443 --> 00:10.010
NIKO:
Hi, Mel. I'm Niko.

00:10.053 --> 00:11.272
I was hoping
we could talk.

00:11.315 --> 00:12.838
How do you know my name?I've seen you around.

00:12.882 --> 00:15.102
What do you do?You could say I help people.

00:15.145 --> 00:18.192
If you ever feel unsafe,
give me a call, okay?

00:18.235 --> 00:19.584
Harry?

00:19.628 --> 00:21.630
My powers.They're not working?

00:21.673 --> 00:23.588
I'm not the man I was
before Tartarus.

00:23.632 --> 00:26.765
I'm not sure I can be their
Whitelighter anymore.

00:26.809 --> 00:28.332
MAGGIE: What are those? MACY: They're letters

00:28.376 --> 00:29.986
between our parents.
They were in touch

00:30.030 --> 00:32.206
all along, and madly
in love with each other.

00:32.249 --> 00:34.121
"But every time
I look at Macy,

00:34.164 --> 00:35.992
"I'm reminded that one day,
she will learn the truth.

00:36.036 --> 00:39.256
"And when she finds out what
we did to... bring her...

00:39.300 --> 00:41.824
"back from the dead,

00:41.867 --> 00:44.174
she'll never forgive us."

00:48.222 --> 00:50.180
MARISOL:
Please.

00:50.224 --> 00:52.226
Please, I freed you
from Tartarus.

00:52.269 --> 00:53.531
You owe me.

00:53.575 --> 00:56.404
Do not make me bury
my baby girl.

00:59.015 --> 01:00.277
Are the
Elders aware

01:00.321 --> 01:02.627
of what you're doing?No.

01:02.671 --> 01:04.107
And they don't
have to be.

01:04.151 --> 01:05.500
I know the Elders
distrust necromancers.

01:05.543 --> 01:07.328
But I need you.

01:07.371 --> 01:09.895
Please, I am begging you.

01:09.939 --> 01:11.158
Please.

01:11.201 --> 01:12.768
And you're prepared to sacrifice

01:12.811 --> 01:14.987
in return
for your daughter's life...

01:15.031 --> 01:16.119
Sacrifice?Yes, yes! Anything!

01:16.163 --> 01:18.208
I know how this works!A resurrection

01:18.252 --> 01:21.472
has a cost, a cosmic debt
that must be repaid.

01:21.516 --> 01:22.778
The spirits will
enlighten me

01:22.821 --> 01:23.996
as to the nature of the debt

01:24.040 --> 01:25.085
once the resurrection
is complete.

01:25.128 --> 01:27.957
We understand.
We understand.

01:28.000 --> 01:30.655
And we are willing
to accept any cost,

01:30.699 --> 01:33.136
as long as that means
Macy gets to live.Stop...

01:43.320 --> 01:44.539
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
what's she doing?!

01:44.582 --> 01:45.540
MARISOL:
It's the blood offering.

02:13.307 --> 02:14.830
Macy!Macy.

02:14.873 --> 02:16.266
Oh, baby girl!

02:16.310 --> 02:18.486
She's okay.

02:18.529 --> 02:20.140
Aw.

02:25.449 --> 02:28.583
The sacrifice--
what is it?

02:28.626 --> 02:31.934
You may live as a happy family
for the next two years.

02:31.977 --> 02:34.415
And then you may never
see Macy again, Marisol.

02:34.458 --> 02:36.286
Your fates are bound.

02:36.330 --> 02:38.636
If you are to lay eyes
on her, she'll die.

02:38.680 --> 02:40.421
The spirits
have decreed it.

02:40.464 --> 02:42.553
No! No!

02:45.295 --> 02:47.254
MEL:
"I'll never forget that night.

02:47.297 --> 02:48.907
"The miracle
of hearing her cries.

02:48.951 --> 02:51.432
"How happy I was.
How scared.

02:51.475 --> 02:53.434
"That night still haunts me.

02:53.477 --> 02:58.439
As Macy grows up, I wonder what
she would think if she knew."

02:58.482 --> 03:00.223
This is unreal.

03:00.267 --> 03:03.618
Mom broke someone out of
Tartarus to resurrect Macy.

03:03.661 --> 03:05.010
It's why she had
the scythe.

03:05.054 --> 03:06.969
Oh, my God.

03:07.012 --> 03:08.492
A necromancer?

03:08.536 --> 03:10.538
What even is that?

03:10.581 --> 03:12.496
Harry.

03:12.540 --> 03:13.715
Good morning, ladies.

03:13.758 --> 03:14.933
You're up and about.

03:14.977 --> 03:15.934
Are you feeling better?

03:15.978 --> 03:17.414
Somewhat.

03:17.458 --> 03:20.200
There's something I need
to discuss with you.

03:21.940 --> 03:24.726
With regards to my status
as your Whitelighter.

03:24.769 --> 03:25.944
Oh, you're doing
great, Har.

03:25.988 --> 03:27.729
In fact, we could
really use some

03:27.772 --> 03:29.383
of that classic Whitelighter
advice right now.

03:30.427 --> 03:31.820
Um...

03:31.863 --> 03:33.952
uh...

03:33.996 --> 03:35.040
Well, spit it out.

03:35.084 --> 03:36.216
Macy was resurrected

03:36.259 --> 03:37.826
by a necromancer
when she was born.

03:37.869 --> 03:39.262
Resurrected by a necromancer?

03:39.306 --> 03:40.872
We can't find
anything

03:40.916 --> 03:42.570
in The Book of Shadows
about them.

03:42.613 --> 03:43.962
Well, that's because
necromancers

03:44.006 --> 03:45.747
use the darkest of dark magic,

03:45.790 --> 03:46.922
strictly forbidden magic,

03:46.965 --> 03:49.925
and are inherently untrustwor...

03:49.968 --> 03:51.970
Where is Macy now?She's still sleeping.

03:52.014 --> 03:54.321
I heard her come home
at 2:00 in the morning.

03:54.364 --> 03:55.887
We were reading
the letters last night.

03:55.931 --> 03:57.889
She just got up
and went for a run.

03:57.933 --> 03:59.369
In the dead of night?It's Macy.

03:59.413 --> 04:00.979
She take baths
at 3:00 a.m.

04:01.023 --> 04:04.287
She... said she needed air,
and I couldn't stop her.

04:04.331 --> 04:07.899
Hey...

04:07.943 --> 04:10.424
How's it going?Stop looking at me like that.

04:10.467 --> 04:12.513
I'm not gonna break.

04:13.905 --> 04:15.864
We're just worried about you.

04:15.907 --> 04:17.082
I know.

04:17.126 --> 04:20.129
And I appreciate
that, but...

04:20.172 --> 04:22.653
save your energy.

04:22.697 --> 04:24.307
Macy...

04:24.351 --> 04:28.355
It's like, no matter what I do,

04:28.398 --> 04:31.923
I can't escape this darkness.

04:31.967 --> 04:34.535
And just as things are
finally looking up in my life,

04:34.578 --> 04:36.319
you know?

04:36.363 --> 04:38.016
I have you three.

04:39.104 --> 04:42.543
Galvin and I are good.

04:42.586 --> 04:44.936
And I learn I'm not
supposed to be here.

04:44.980 --> 04:48.113
Of course you're supposed
to be here.

04:48.157 --> 04:49.941
Mom brought you back
for a reason.

04:49.985 --> 04:51.508
Your sister's right.

04:51.552 --> 04:53.162
Take it from me.

04:53.205 --> 04:54.990
You must look for
the positives.

04:55.033 --> 04:57.166
Harry...
I know you're our Whitelighter

04:57.209 --> 04:59.342
and you're supposed
to give us these pep talks,

04:59.386 --> 05:01.213
but I can't hear it right now.

05:02.258 --> 05:04.652
I just want my coffee.

05:16.011 --> 05:18.709
I just want to be left alone.

05:18.753 --> 05:21.495
I'm not here to lecture you
or give you a rousing pep talk,

05:21.538 --> 05:23.453
although that is my speciality.

05:23.497 --> 05:27.196
I'm just here to say
I know how you feel.

05:27.239 --> 05:29.067
Okay.

05:30.068 --> 05:34.421
I died, and the Elders
brought me back.

05:34.464 --> 05:36.205
And although
it's not quite the same,

05:36.248 --> 05:37.902
I experienced
the same struggle,

05:37.946 --> 05:40.122
the confusion
of cheating death.

05:40.165 --> 05:41.863
And whatever you're feeling,

05:41.906 --> 05:44.431
I assure you,
it's perfectly normal.

05:48.086 --> 05:50.741
I feel... tainted.

05:50.785 --> 05:53.048
In science, when
something dies,

05:53.091 --> 05:55.093
it doesn't come back.

05:55.137 --> 05:57.748
It's unnatural.
It's inherently wrong.

05:57.792 --> 06:00.055
I'm inherently wrong.

06:01.578 --> 06:02.797
No offense.

06:02.840 --> 06:04.538
None taken.

06:06.061 --> 06:08.150
What if my resurrection

06:08.193 --> 06:10.587
is where my darkness comes from?

06:10.631 --> 06:12.372
It's possible.

06:12.415 --> 06:14.374
But don't go down
that rabbit hole

06:14.417 --> 06:17.072
of depression
and uncertainty.

06:18.203 --> 06:20.249
How did you avoid it,

06:20.292 --> 06:22.860
going down
that rabbit hole?

06:22.904 --> 06:26.211
I got as many answers
as I could.

06:26.255 --> 06:29.389
I may not have had my memories,
but I could learn

06:29.432 --> 06:31.434
why I was still here,

06:31.478 --> 06:33.871
what it meant
to be a Whitelighter.

06:33.915 --> 06:37.875
You are a Charmed One.

06:39.224 --> 06:41.618
Find your answers.

06:41.662 --> 06:44.665
To this day,
I'm still learning.

06:46.188 --> 06:50.453
Think what you've already
learned from those letters.

06:50.497 --> 06:52.324
Perhaps there's more.

06:53.456 --> 06:55.415
Maybe you're right.That's the ticket.

06:55.458 --> 06:57.286
If you need me,
you know where to find me.

07:05.816 --> 07:08.384
Time for answers.

07:11.169 --> 07:13.781
MAGGIE: Mel, you are playing with fire.

07:15.130 --> 07:16.740
Niko's Insta?

07:16.784 --> 07:19.395
Come on, you have been so good
about staying off her socials.

07:19.439 --> 07:22.224
I didn't
plan to run into her.

07:22.267 --> 07:23.921
And you can't blame me
for being curious

07:23.965 --> 07:25.923
about the ex whose
memory I wiped.

07:25.967 --> 07:29.318
It's just weird that she
became a P.I., isn't it?

07:29.361 --> 07:31.189
Like, what could have
happened in those two years

07:31.233 --> 07:32.495
we were supposed
to be together

07:32.539 --> 07:35.367
that would make her
quit being a cop?

07:35.411 --> 07:39.023
Like I said,
I was just curious.

07:39.067 --> 07:41.722
Look, I know it's hard,

07:41.765 --> 07:44.507
but you can't get involved
with Niko again.

07:44.551 --> 07:46.161
Obviously.

07:46.204 --> 07:48.729
That would be insane and
break some magical rule

07:48.772 --> 07:50.513
that would cause all
kinds of problems.

07:50.557 --> 07:52.297
So don't worry
about it.

07:54.386 --> 07:55.518
You won't abuse this?

07:55.562 --> 07:56.954
Promise.

07:58.869 --> 08:00.262
See you later.

08:00.305 --> 08:02.220
See ya.

08:02.264 --> 08:03.483
Love you.

08:03.526 --> 08:05.310
Oh, hey, Lucy.

08:05.354 --> 08:06.747
Oh, hey, Mel.

08:08.488 --> 08:10.272
Maggie.

08:10.315 --> 08:11.708
I was hoping to see you.

08:11.752 --> 08:13.405
Supes important question:

08:13.449 --> 08:16.321
Are you going to the Phi Delt
Stoplight Party tonight?

08:16.365 --> 08:18.628
Oh, um... I don't think so,

08:18.672 --> 08:21.326
seeing as I don't
know what that is.
Oh.

08:21.370 --> 08:22.502
Everyone dresses the part
of the stoplight

08:22.545 --> 08:23.894
they identify with.

08:23.938 --> 08:26.549
Wearing red means,
"Back off. I'm booed up."

08:26.593 --> 08:29.334
Yellow means, "I'm FWBs
with that guy in chem class

08:29.378 --> 08:30.727
but still tech available."

08:30.771 --> 08:32.294
And green means, "Go.

08:32.337 --> 08:35.123
Straight into my pants."

08:35.166 --> 08:36.428
Oh.

08:36.472 --> 08:38.082
Wow, that's direct.

08:38.126 --> 08:40.911
I just... I don't want
to run into Parker.

08:40.955 --> 08:42.652
Don't you not want
to see him, either?

08:42.696 --> 08:44.741
Maggie, when I move on,
I move on.

08:44.785 --> 08:46.961
Thank you. Next.

08:47.004 --> 08:48.310
You should try it.

08:48.353 --> 08:49.572
I've moved on.

08:49.616 --> 08:52.053
Then what's the issue
if you see him there?

08:52.096 --> 08:54.272
I want to get you
circulating again.

08:54.316 --> 08:56.753
I'm hoping to get you back
into Kappa by spring rush.

08:56.797 --> 08:58.450
Wait, really?Mm-hmm.

08:58.494 --> 08:59.713
You're welcome.

09:00.714 --> 09:02.411
You know what?

09:02.454 --> 09:03.804
You're right.

09:03.847 --> 09:05.632
Why am I giving Parker
all the power?

09:05.675 --> 09:08.460
Screw it. I am gonna wear the
hottest green outfit I have,

09:08.504 --> 09:10.375
and he can just deal with it.

09:10.419 --> 09:11.594
Yes.

09:11.638 --> 09:13.204
Green means go, girl.

09:33.137 --> 09:36.010
I summon the one
who brought me back.

09:36.053 --> 09:37.272
Hear my plea.

09:37.315 --> 09:38.969
I call you here

09:39.013 --> 09:41.319
as you called me from beyond.

09:54.289 --> 09:57.684
I summon the one
who brought me back.

09:57.727 --> 09:59.599
Hear my plea.

09:59.642 --> 10:04.342
I call you here
as you called me from beyond!

10:29.585 --> 10:32.544
You have no idea
what you've done.

10:38.159 --> 10:40.291
Where is she? Is she here?
Are you working with her?

10:40.335 --> 10:42.293
I don't know who
you're talking about.

10:42.337 --> 10:44.295
Cyd, that crazy witch
that's hunting me.

10:44.339 --> 10:46.515
If you're not working with her,
then why did you break

10:46.558 --> 10:47.951
my concealment spell
and lure me here?

10:47.995 --> 10:52.042
Well, I...

10:52.086 --> 10:54.436
I think you brought me
back from the dead.

10:54.479 --> 10:56.917
Well, great.
Your little summoning spell

10:56.960 --> 10:59.310
just put a giant target
on my back.

10:59.354 --> 11:02.096
I have to brew a new spell fast
before she finds me.

11:02.966 --> 11:05.012
Where are we?

11:05.055 --> 11:06.883
Oh, we're at my house.

11:06.927 --> 11:09.016
Please, are you the one
who brought me back?

11:17.720 --> 11:19.983
I'd recognize
that soul anywhere.

11:21.463 --> 11:23.683
So, why did you call me?

11:23.726 --> 11:25.859
I need answers.

11:25.902 --> 11:28.905
Fine. Then help me
brew my spell.

11:28.949 --> 11:30.864
Where's your kitchen?

11:31.952 --> 11:33.605
I...

11:41.483 --> 11:43.093
NIKO:
Hey.

11:43.137 --> 11:45.748
Over here.

11:45.792 --> 11:47.663
Sorry I'm late.

11:47.707 --> 11:49.099
How did you pick this place?

11:49.143 --> 11:51.493
I don't know, I was just
walking by the other day,

11:51.536 --> 11:53.756
and something about it
just drew me in.

11:53.800 --> 11:55.758
Why? Have you
been here before?

11:55.802 --> 11:58.021
Mel, you need to breathe.

11:58.065 --> 11:59.240
Oh.

11:59.283 --> 12:01.372
Is it that kind of coffee date?

12:01.416 --> 12:04.375
No, it's an "I'm worried
about you" coffee date.

12:04.419 --> 12:05.986
Uh, yeah.

12:06.029 --> 12:08.379
Thanks for meeting me.
It's a brave first step

12:08.423 --> 12:10.860
extricating yourself
from a dangerous group.

12:17.954 --> 12:19.390
I know it's hard.

12:19.434 --> 12:20.827
WAITER:
What can I get for you?

12:20.870 --> 12:23.003
Two double espressos.Oh. Got it.

12:23.046 --> 12:24.961
How did you know?

12:27.877 --> 12:29.705
I made the change
two years ago.

12:29.749 --> 12:30.793
I was a cop.

12:30.837 --> 12:32.577
Really?

12:32.621 --> 12:35.232
Yeah. On the verge of
making detective, but...

12:35.276 --> 12:37.582
I don't know, one
day I just woke up

12:37.626 --> 12:40.150
and felt like
something was missing.

12:40.194 --> 12:42.413
It's hard to explain.

12:42.457 --> 12:44.633
I know the feeling.

12:44.676 --> 12:47.070
Yeah, you know,
I had this great job,

12:47.114 --> 12:49.159
but something
didn't feel right.

12:49.203 --> 12:50.987
So I made the change.

12:51.031 --> 12:53.729
And how is that
working out for you?

12:53.773 --> 12:54.861
I love my work.

12:54.904 --> 12:57.646
I get to help people
who have been lost.

12:57.689 --> 13:00.518
I just really feel like I'm
doing what I should be doing.

13:03.870 --> 13:05.959
Sorry if I'm oversharing.

13:06.002 --> 13:07.569
You're really
easy to talk to.Oh.

13:07.612 --> 13:09.136
WAITER:
Here you go.

13:09.179 --> 13:11.181
Oh, I am so sorry.

13:15.185 --> 13:16.839
Whoa.

13:16.883 --> 13:18.188
That scar,
how'd you get it?

13:20.103 --> 13:21.757
It's a long story.

13:24.760 --> 13:26.109
Sorry.

13:26.153 --> 13:29.373
I just had the most
vivid sense of déjà vu.

13:33.943 --> 13:35.989
You wanted to see me?

13:38.034 --> 13:39.906
Yes. Yes.

13:39.949 --> 13:41.342
Is this about Niko?

13:41.385 --> 13:43.735
Excuse me. Niko?

13:43.779 --> 13:46.216
Oh. Damn.

13:46.260 --> 13:48.131
It's nothing.
I bumped into Niko

13:48.175 --> 13:51.004
at The Haunt the other day--
it's not a big deal.

13:51.047 --> 13:52.919
It is a big deal.Yeah, and your text said

13:52.962 --> 13:55.356
whatever you needed to
talk about was a big deal, too.

13:55.399 --> 13:56.966
So now it's your turn.
Spit it out.

13:58.576 --> 14:00.883
I texted your sisters, too.

14:00.927 --> 14:02.667
Perhaps we should wait.

14:04.191 --> 14:06.671
I'll be honest--
you're not what I expected.

14:06.715 --> 14:09.109
Well, you summoned
me from work.

14:09.152 --> 14:11.024
Necromancy doesn't
exactly pay the bills.

14:11.067 --> 14:13.243
Well, I just meant
you're so young.

14:13.287 --> 14:15.289
Necromancers age slowly.

14:15.332 --> 14:16.638
Hand me the mint.

14:16.681 --> 14:18.858
I need to mix it with
the hair from the mouse.

14:22.992 --> 14:24.907
You're a telekinetic.

14:24.951 --> 14:26.256
Interesting.

14:26.300 --> 14:28.128
Why did you kill the
mouse with the knife

14:28.171 --> 14:30.565
when you could have just stopped
its heart with your mind?

14:31.609 --> 14:32.915
I can do that?

14:32.959 --> 14:34.264
You didn't know?

14:34.308 --> 14:35.787
No.

14:35.831 --> 14:39.661
So, my mom broke you
out of Tartarus?

14:41.445 --> 14:42.794
Why were you there?

14:42.838 --> 14:44.927
Half the people that
are there shouldn't be.

14:44.971 --> 14:46.537
I was one of them.

14:47.756 --> 14:49.540
So what happened?

14:49.584 --> 14:51.760
The witch that's hunting me

14:51.803 --> 14:55.982
asked me to resurrect a
demon she had fallen for.

14:56.025 --> 14:58.158
When I refused,
this witch--

14:58.201 --> 15:00.377
Cyd-- reported me
to the Elders,

15:00.421 --> 15:03.163
claimed I was the one trying
to resurrect the demon,

15:03.206 --> 15:05.295
so they condemned
me to Tartarus.

15:05.339 --> 15:06.949
And they just took
her word for it?

15:06.993 --> 15:11.040
The Elders despise
necromancers.

15:11.084 --> 15:12.955
They malign us and
spread lies about us

15:12.999 --> 15:14.826
and tell people
to shun us.

15:14.870 --> 15:18.874
And when those in power
repeat lies long enough,

15:18.918 --> 15:21.181
people start to
believe them.

15:21.224 --> 15:23.226
Just turn on the news.

15:27.448 --> 15:28.623
Oh, damn it.

15:28.666 --> 15:29.711
What?

15:35.760 --> 15:37.762
What just happened?

15:37.806 --> 15:40.678
Rodents can't handle
the transition, so it turned.

15:40.722 --> 15:42.419
What do you mean, turned?

15:42.463 --> 15:44.682
Resurrection is
serious business.

15:44.726 --> 15:46.946
I must call forth forces
of light and darkness

15:46.989 --> 15:48.469
to make it happen.

15:49.731 --> 15:51.863
Some beings
can't handle it.

15:51.907 --> 15:55.780
The balance tips,
and the being turns dark.

16:00.133 --> 16:02.744
I've been told
I have darkness in me.

16:03.788 --> 16:05.747
Does that mean
I'm going to turn?

16:05.790 --> 16:07.009
MAGGIE:
Hey, Macy.

16:07.053 --> 16:08.837
Sister emergency.
Do I look better

16:08.880 --> 16:10.882
in olive or emerald?

16:10.926 --> 16:12.797
Hey. I know you.

16:12.841 --> 16:14.408
You're Knansie with a "K,"
the gorge cashier

16:14.451 --> 16:16.801
at Handy Dandy Snacks
in Ferndale.

16:16.845 --> 16:18.760
Uh, and she's also
the necromancer

16:18.803 --> 16:20.544
who brought me back to life.

16:20.588 --> 16:22.024
Oh, my God.

16:22.068 --> 16:23.199
Macy.

16:23.243 --> 16:24.679
Harry said
they're dangerous.

16:25.810 --> 16:28.161
See what I mean?

16:30.902 --> 16:33.862
Cyd! She found me.

16:33.905 --> 16:35.255
That's Macy now.

16:35.298 --> 16:36.821
She and Maggie are
being attacked

16:36.865 --> 16:39.607
by some kind of demon.They're in trouble. Right.

16:39.650 --> 16:42.001
Let's put a pin in this
and get home to your sisters.

16:42.044 --> 16:43.741
Okay.

16:46.222 --> 16:48.442
Oh, dear, my powers have
been rather wonky lately.

16:48.485 --> 16:50.661
Wait, why is it night
all of a sudden?

16:50.705 --> 16:53.403
Why is that siren so weird?

16:55.492 --> 16:58.191
I don't think we're
in Hilltowne, Harry.

16:58.234 --> 17:01.672
We're in...
England.

17:01.716 --> 17:02.978
What happened?

17:03.022 --> 17:05.894
This is what I needed
to talk to you about.

17:05.937 --> 17:10.594
Lately, I've been distracted
by... a personal matter.

17:10.638 --> 17:13.467
As a consequence, I've become
emotionally uncentered,

17:13.510 --> 17:16.339
unbalancing my powers,
rendering them unreliable.

17:16.383 --> 17:21.083
And now... I've got us
stuck in Manchester.

17:21.127 --> 17:23.303
Why are we in Manchester?

17:24.913 --> 17:27.002
Because my son is here.

17:33.400 --> 17:35.184
What is going on?

17:43.018 --> 17:45.325
What the hell
do you think you're doing?

17:45.368 --> 17:46.848
This is my home.

17:46.891 --> 17:49.372
That woman destroyed my family.

17:49.416 --> 17:51.983
No.
She turned the love of
my life into a demon.

17:52.027 --> 17:54.116
What?Don't believe her, Macy.

17:54.160 --> 17:55.596
I told you what happened.

17:55.639 --> 17:57.685
I refused to raise
her demon boyfriend for her,

17:57.728 --> 17:59.643
and the witch has been
after me ever since.

17:59.687 --> 18:01.471
Wait, she's a witch?

18:01.515 --> 18:02.820
Time to pay for what you did.

18:04.387 --> 18:05.910
Maggie, get Knansie out of here!

18:15.137 --> 18:17.096
Move aside, witch.

18:17.139 --> 18:19.446
I don't want you.
Just hand me the necromancer.

18:19.489 --> 18:20.925
Cyd, is it?

18:20.969 --> 18:23.493
Yeah, why don't we
just talk this out.

18:23.537 --> 18:24.799
Maggie.

18:24.842 --> 18:26.931
Stay away from my sister!

18:34.330 --> 18:36.898
KNANSIE:
I knew you had it in you.

18:36.941 --> 18:40.554
Wow, those are some sick moves.
Where did that come from?

18:40.597 --> 18:42.817
I have no idea.

18:42.860 --> 18:44.906
We have to bind Cyd with
the Chains of Antioch.

18:44.949 --> 18:46.777
I can conjure them,
but we have to hurry,

18:46.821 --> 18:48.518
before she comes to.

18:50.172 --> 18:52.914
They were attacked
by an unhinged witch,

18:52.957 --> 18:54.481
not a demon.

18:54.524 --> 18:56.570
And it sounds like they've
got it under control.

18:56.613 --> 18:58.702
Thank goodness.

18:58.746 --> 19:00.922
So?

19:00.965 --> 19:03.533
You were about to explain?

19:03.577 --> 19:06.797
About your son?

19:06.841 --> 19:08.843
If we're gonna talk
about this,

19:08.886 --> 19:11.237
I'm gonna need a pint.

19:14.501 --> 19:17.068
When I returned from Tartarus,

19:17.112 --> 19:22.857
Charity informed me...
my son was alive.

19:22.900 --> 19:25.816
And that matched with a vision
of a boy I'd seen

19:25.860 --> 19:26.904
while in Tartarus.

19:26.948 --> 19:28.906
Oh, my God, Harry.

19:28.950 --> 19:31.822
And I haven't been able to
focus on anything else since.

19:31.866 --> 19:34.608
Of course you haven't.

19:34.651 --> 19:36.218
I understand.

19:36.262 --> 19:38.133
Yes, but you see, it's...

19:38.177 --> 19:39.961
it's a problem.

19:40.004 --> 19:42.877
My reaction...
well, it illustrates

19:42.920 --> 19:45.053
why the Elders wipe
Whitelighters' memories.

19:45.096 --> 19:50.928
My divided loyalty
has clouded my powers.

19:50.972 --> 19:52.626
Hence, the fact
we're sharing a drink

19:52.669 --> 19:54.932
at the Drunken Footman
rather than The Haunt.

19:54.976 --> 19:56.630
And my powers will not return

19:56.673 --> 20:00.068
until I can prove
I am 100% committed

20:00.111 --> 20:01.852
to my charges' care.

20:03.767 --> 20:06.901
But now I-I can't un-know
my past now.

20:06.944 --> 20:11.471
And even if I could...
I don't want to.

20:11.514 --> 20:13.124
So I'm afraid

20:13.168 --> 20:16.867
my loyalty will remain divided.

20:16.911 --> 20:20.393
Wait, Harry, the thing that
you've been trying to tell us...

20:21.959 --> 20:25.224
I can't be
your Whitelighter anymore.

20:31.230 --> 20:34.972
I don't want to lose you.

20:35.016 --> 20:38.933
But since neither of us
have passports

20:38.976 --> 20:41.022
and you can't
orb us back home...

20:42.241 --> 20:44.155
...I'm gonna help you
find your son.

20:45.722 --> 20:46.941
Thank you, Mel.

20:46.984 --> 20:47.942
Honestly...

20:47.985 --> 20:48.899
Yeah, yeah.

20:48.943 --> 20:51.032
Save your mushy stuff, Harry.

20:51.075 --> 20:54.165
Now, what do you know
about this son of yours?

20:54.209 --> 20:56.167
Oh, there's the rub.
I actually know nothing.

20:56.211 --> 20:57.691
Not his name, his birthday.

20:57.734 --> 20:59.345
Hell, I don't even know
my own name.

20:59.388 --> 21:02.261
The Elders gave me a new one
when they resurrected me.

21:05.046 --> 21:07.396
So that's
not ideal.

21:07.440 --> 21:09.703
No.

21:15.883 --> 21:17.972
: Are you sure
we can trust Knansie with a "K"?

21:18.015 --> 21:19.495
Harry warned us
about necromancers.

21:19.539 --> 21:21.323
Thank you both so much.

21:21.367 --> 21:24.065
Not many witches would have
a necromancer's back.

21:24.108 --> 21:25.719
Well, you did bring
me back to life,

21:25.762 --> 21:27.111
so it's the
least I can do.

21:28.330 --> 21:29.288
Little joke there.

21:29.331 --> 21:30.419
Right, Maggie?

21:30.463 --> 21:32.073
Yeah.

21:32.116 --> 21:34.075
Maggie, don't you have
that Phi Delt party

21:34.118 --> 21:35.990
to go to?Yeah, but I can skip it.

21:36.033 --> 21:38.079
No, don't be silly.
Go. Have fun.

21:38.122 --> 21:40.255
I think we have things
under control here.

21:40.299 --> 21:41.865
Besides, there
are a few things

21:41.909 --> 21:44.303
I wanted to talk
to Knansie about

21:44.346 --> 21:46.130
that I was hoping
to do in private.

21:46.174 --> 21:47.741
MAGGIE:
Okay.

21:47.784 --> 21:50.091
Just text me
if you need anything.

21:52.180 --> 21:54.400
So, what do we do now?

21:54.443 --> 21:57.011
I know this may sound harsh,
but...

21:57.054 --> 21:59.100
I think we have to kill her.

21:59.143 --> 22:02.059
No, I can't kill a fellow witch.

22:02.103 --> 22:04.410
Cyd's in pain.

22:04.453 --> 22:05.411
She needs our help.

22:05.454 --> 22:06.847
I can't keep running.

22:06.890 --> 22:08.152
It has been 20 years.

22:08.196 --> 22:09.415
I am tired.

22:09.458 --> 22:11.068
I understand that.

22:11.112 --> 22:13.027
Maybe we can ask
my Whitelighter for help

22:13.070 --> 22:14.898
when he's back.No.

22:14.942 --> 22:17.161
Absolutely not.

22:17.205 --> 22:19.990
Whitelighters serve
the Elders.

22:20.034 --> 22:22.515
They'll just take her side
and send me back to Tartarus.

22:22.558 --> 22:24.255
I will stand up for you.

22:24.299 --> 22:25.256
I'm a Charmed One.

22:25.300 --> 22:27.389
They'll listen to me.

22:27.433 --> 22:28.956
Okay.

22:28.999 --> 22:30.871
Thank you.Great.

22:30.914 --> 22:32.263
So, let's get
The Book of Shadows

22:32.307 --> 22:34.570

to contain her.

I just can't explain... ♪

22:53.937 --> 22:56.070
Oh, my God, Parker just
saw me looking at him.

22:56.113 --> 22:58.986
Well, news flash-- that means
that he's looking at you, too.

22:59.029 --> 23:00.466
It's obvious
you're making him jelly.

23:00.509 --> 23:02.468
Not to mention,
he must be freaking out

23:02.511 --> 23:05.122
to see the two
of us together.

23:05.166 --> 23:06.602
Oh.

23:09.431 --> 23:10.780
Yes.

23:10.824 --> 23:13.479
So, how was winter break?

23:13.522 --> 23:17.004
MAGGIE:
Let's see, I was in Tartarus
being tortured, so...

23:17.047 --> 23:18.266
Kind of hellish.

23:18.309 --> 23:20.442
Totally get it.
Family crap?

23:20.486 --> 23:22.313
Yeah. Something like that.

23:22.357 --> 23:24.185
I know you used to date Parker.

23:24.228 --> 23:25.142
What happened
with you guys?

23:25.186 --> 23:26.535
He's a demon.

23:26.579 --> 23:28.537
He's just not
who I thought he was.

23:28.581 --> 23:29.886
Psych major, huh?

23:29.930 --> 23:31.366
What made you pick that?

23:31.410 --> 23:32.541
I'm an empath witch,

23:32.585 --> 23:34.151
so it seemed like a good fit.

23:34.195 --> 23:35.675
Seemed easier than med school.

23:42.246 --> 23:43.813
How goes it?

23:43.857 --> 23:47.077
Oh... it goes nowhere.

23:47.121 --> 23:49.210
I'm just not connecting
with anyone.

23:49.253 --> 23:52.692
All right,
let's get some "dronks."

23:52.735 --> 23:55.608
WOMAN:
Lucy, over here!

24:00.656 --> 24:02.353
Hi.

24:03.485 --> 24:05.226
You look good in green.

24:05.269 --> 24:06.488
Why are you wearing red?

24:06.532 --> 24:08.229
You know why.

24:08.272 --> 24:11.058
I'll take two skinny margs.

24:12.102 --> 24:13.582
Can we talk, please?

24:13.626 --> 24:14.670
No.

24:16.455 --> 24:18.195
You gonna be mad
at me forever?

24:18.239 --> 24:21.242
Maybe. You have ruined
dating for me forever.

24:21.285 --> 24:22.809
I met a bunch of guys tonight

24:22.852 --> 24:24.506
who I would have been
into before, but...

24:24.550 --> 24:26.073
I can't be myself with them.

24:26.116 --> 24:27.509
You're the only one
I can be honest with

24:27.553 --> 24:29.337
and the only one who can
know who I really am.

24:29.380 --> 24:31.252
But you're a dick

24:31.295 --> 24:33.646
who lied to me and sold
me and my sisters out

24:33.689 --> 24:35.082
to your sociopathic
demon father.

24:35.125 --> 24:37.476
So I guess I'll just
become a nun.

24:37.519 --> 24:39.173
Probably can't do that
because I'm a witch.

24:39.216 --> 24:40.522
So, thank you.

24:40.566 --> 24:43.090
See, and now you're smiling
at my cute nun joke,

24:43.133 --> 24:45.092
and I just want to
punch your face in.

24:45.135 --> 24:48.051
Look, I know I did some really
crappy things in the past,

24:48.095 --> 24:50.097
but I didn't sell you out
to my dad.

24:50.140 --> 24:51.707
I don't know how else
to prove it to you.

24:51.751 --> 24:52.926
You can't.

24:52.969 --> 24:54.754
I really am trying, Maggie.

24:57.713 --> 25:00.499
All right, this calming spell
should dissipate her rage.

25:00.542 --> 25:03.545
Good, because I can't
keep running from her.

25:05.460 --> 25:06.592
Oh, my.

25:17.603 --> 25:19.561
MEL:
We've been looking all night.

25:19.605 --> 25:20.867
We were
dropped here for a reason.

25:20.910 --> 25:22.042
There must be
something important

25:22.085 --> 25:23.565
about this neighborhood.

25:23.609 --> 25:25.306
Nah, not that I
can think of.

25:25.349 --> 25:28.396
Anything at all triggered
from the memories in Tartarus?

25:28.439 --> 25:30.920
Nothing.
Okay.

25:30.964 --> 25:33.357
Déjà vu may be
our best bet here.

25:33.401 --> 25:35.751
Are there any buildings
that you feel drawn to?

25:35.795 --> 25:38.362
Niko mentioned at coffee
that she felt like she'd been

25:38.406 --> 25:39.755
to the cafe before.Wait, coffee?

25:39.799 --> 25:41.365
You said you saw her
at The Haunt.

25:41.409 --> 25:44.368
I did, first.
But the point is,

25:44.412 --> 25:46.980
look around, see if you
feel drawn to anything.

25:52.594 --> 25:54.074
That church.

25:57.991 --> 26:01.516
WOMAN: Excuse me,
do you have a tampon?

26:01.560 --> 26:05.128
Yeah, yeah. No problem.

26:13.441 --> 26:15.530
Anything?

26:17.880 --> 26:19.882
No, nothing.

26:21.841 --> 26:24.017
Don't churches
have records?

26:29.065 --> 26:30.632
HARRY:
Here.

26:32.982 --> 26:35.115
The church christening records.

26:37.508 --> 26:39.902
Oh, damn it.

26:39.946 --> 26:41.251
Let me see.

26:41.295 --> 26:43.079
Oh, it's just a paper cut.Please.

26:43.123 --> 26:45.081
Let me try.

26:47.083 --> 26:48.868
My powers.

26:48.911 --> 26:51.653
I don't know if
they'll ever come back.

26:51.697 --> 26:53.742
Which is why we need
to find your son.

26:55.788 --> 26:57.877
MEL: These files go back
all the way to the 1940s.

26:57.920 --> 26:59.443
Hmm.

26:59.487 --> 27:00.967
Is there anything
that you can remember

27:01.010 --> 27:02.316
that can help us
narrow it down?

27:02.359 --> 27:04.361
I know I died in 1957,

27:04.405 --> 27:07.103
and the child in my memory
was around four.

27:07.147 --> 27:09.366
So he would have been
born in 1953.

27:09.410 --> 27:11.107
And babies are usually
christened a few months

27:11.151 --> 27:12.587
after their bir...

27:16.504 --> 27:17.897
What is it?

27:17.940 --> 27:20.247
That's me.

27:22.075 --> 27:24.077
And my wife.

27:25.861 --> 27:27.558
You were married.

27:29.996 --> 27:31.954
Yes, apparently so.

27:31.998 --> 27:35.001
"James Westwell
and his wife, Clara,

27:35.044 --> 27:39.788
celebrate the christening
of their son, Carter."

27:39.832 --> 27:42.661
His name is Carter.

27:45.054 --> 27:47.230
Are you okay?

27:47.274 --> 27:48.971
Mm.

27:50.973 --> 27:53.933
It's time to find my son.

27:53.976 --> 27:56.239
You should have
let me kill her

27:56.283 --> 27:57.850
when I had the chance.

27:57.893 --> 28:00.809
Better yet, you could have
killed her with your power.

28:00.853 --> 28:03.507
You're not helping.But I'm right.

28:03.551 --> 28:05.596
That witch is dangerous,
and don't think for a second

28:05.640 --> 28:07.250
she won't kill you
in order to get to me.

28:07.294 --> 28:10.036
She has lost her mind.

29:30.943 --> 29:32.814
your left circumflex
coronary artery,

29:32.858 --> 29:34.729
shutting off the blood flow

No!

Finish the job.

30:23.299 --> 30:25.084
Why are you protecting her?

You're a witch,

30:27.477 --> 30:29.392
and she's evil.KNANSIE:
Don't listen to her.

30:29.436 --> 30:31.655
No, she's not evil. You've just
been listening to the Elders.

30:31.699 --> 30:32.961
This has nothing to do

30:33.005 --> 30:34.267
with the Elders.
Knansie's lying.

30:35.877 --> 30:37.836
Knansie uses demon blood
to raise the dead.

30:37.879 --> 30:39.489
What?

30:39.533 --> 30:41.883
Knansie made a deal
with a demon.

30:41.927 --> 30:45.887
In exchange for eternal youth,
every person

30:45.931 --> 30:48.585
that Knansie resurrects
turns into a demon.

30:48.629 --> 30:50.979
This is exactly how she got
the Elders to turn against me.

30:51.023 --> 30:53.068
'Cause of her, I had to vanquish
the man that I loved

30:53.112 --> 30:55.244
when he turned demonic
and tried to kill me.

30:55.288 --> 30:56.942
Is that true?

31:01.903 --> 31:04.079
Let me go!

31:08.431 --> 31:10.085
You're a demon?

31:10.129 --> 31:12.131
Half-demon.
But who's counting?

31:12.174 --> 31:14.611
I attacked a demon.
Oh, no.

31:14.655 --> 31:17.397
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

31:17.440 --> 31:19.051

I didn't mean to.

31:19.094 --> 31:21.401
And broke the terms
of her demonic pact.

31:21.444 --> 31:24.186

into the world

31:24.230 --> 31:26.623

another chance.

Are you sure?

31:51.170 --> 31:52.301
Yes.

31:52.345 --> 31:55.174
It's the demon blood she uses.

31:56.915 --> 31:58.046
Why?

31:59.395 --> 32:02.181
Because she resurrected me.

32:05.271 --> 32:07.751
Okay.

32:07.795 --> 32:11.277

34:56.616 --> 34:59.358
How are you feeling?

35:01.534 --> 35:03.275
Surprisingly okay.

35:03.318 --> 35:06.669
It feels great
to know the truth.

35:06.713 --> 35:08.410
To know why Mom
couldn't raise me,

35:08.454 --> 35:11.152
to know the truth
about my darkness.

35:13.198 --> 35:15.287
I have demon blood in me.

35:15.330 --> 35:18.333
Well, you know, Parker
has demon blood in him, and...

35:18.377 --> 35:20.335
he fights it.

35:20.379 --> 35:23.556
I felt how it takes over.

35:25.166 --> 35:28.343
When I was stopping
Cyd's heart...

35:28.387 --> 35:32.217
it was like this
intoxicating rush of power.

35:33.261 --> 35:35.220
But you didn't.

35:35.263 --> 35:37.309
And that's what matters.

35:37.352 --> 35:39.833
Only because Maggie
stopped me.

35:39.876 --> 35:42.488
If I ever fully lost control,

35:42.531 --> 35:44.620
gave in to my darkness...

35:44.664 --> 35:46.318
You won't.

35:46.361 --> 35:48.189
'Cause you're a good person.

35:48.233 --> 35:51.192
I know I am.

35:51.236 --> 35:53.673
For now, at least.

35:55.370 --> 35:58.547
Mom didn't know I was
given demon blood.

35:58.591 --> 36:01.028
Her sacrifice
in bringing me back

36:01.071 --> 36:03.552
was purely selfless

36:03.596 --> 36:05.467
and out of love.

36:07.948 --> 36:10.429
And her strength in that
has given me the strength

36:10.472 --> 36:13.171
to face what I have to do next.

36:14.694 --> 36:17.000
I'd like to make a deal.

36:19.220 --> 36:22.441
And what kind of deal
are you talking about?

36:22.484 --> 36:24.660
You know I'm a witch.

36:24.704 --> 36:26.662
And I know your son's a demon.

36:28.795 --> 36:30.971
Parker is half-demon,

36:31.014 --> 36:32.712
and I am doing
everything I can

36:32.755 --> 36:35.758
to take the demon half
out of him.

36:35.802 --> 36:37.543
Which is why you've been
studying my DNA.

36:41.329 --> 36:43.288
I'm just trying to save my son.

36:43.331 --> 36:45.290
Right.

36:45.333 --> 36:47.466
And that's where
our deal comes in.

36:47.509 --> 36:49.511
I'll help you

36:49.555 --> 36:51.948
find a way to take
the demon out of Parker.

36:51.992 --> 36:53.733
But first,

36:53.776 --> 36:57.780
you will find a way
to take the demon out of me.

37:01.567 --> 37:04.352

37:23.415 --> 37:24.764

37:24.807 --> 37:27.636
It still hurts.

♪ Caught in the middle of it.

37:55.142 --> 37:56.578
Look...

37:57.666 --> 37:59.320
...I don't hate you.

37:59.364 --> 38:02.323
And that was really cool,
what you did last night,

38:02.367 --> 38:03.846
talking Macy down.

38:05.718 --> 38:07.589
So what does that mean for us?

38:09.461 --> 38:11.767
It means that...

38:11.811 --> 38:13.813
I don't hate you.

38:15.423 --> 38:17.425
And that has
to be enough.

38:18.513 --> 38:20.428
For now.

38:22.561 --> 38:24.389
LUCY:
Our little plan
is totally working.

38:24.432 --> 38:27.653
Maggie and Parker will be fully
back together by spring break.

38:27.696 --> 38:29.437
I got them to talk at the party.

38:29.481 --> 38:32.397
I even saw them leaving
the bathroom together.

38:32.440 --> 38:35.400
Leaving a bathroom together
is not "together."

38:35.443 --> 38:39.273
I need Maggie
back in love with him.Yeah,

38:39.317 --> 38:41.275
you want them
in a legit relaysh.Yeah.

38:41.319 --> 38:44.191
Which means you got to
slow burn this thing.

38:44.234 --> 38:47.716
I don't have time
for a slow burn.

38:47.760 --> 38:50.502
I need them closer than ever.

38:50.545 --> 38:52.678
Two becoming one.

38:52.721 --> 38:54.462
That's what I'm after.

38:54.506 --> 38:55.768
Do you understand?

38:55.811 --> 38:57.552
Of course I understand.

38:57.596 --> 38:59.598
I'm extremely smart.

38:59.641 --> 39:02.078
When you see your friend
Maggie again,

39:02.122 --> 39:04.690
push a little more.

39:04.733 --> 39:06.909
I don't have all the time
in the world, Lucy.

39:06.953 --> 39:08.171
Yes, sir.

39:08.215 --> 39:09.564
Good girl.

39:19.705 --> 39:22.360
Okay, betches,
who took my zit cream?!
