WEBVTT

00:17.350 --> 00:20.086
Paul, darling,
please refrain

00:20.186 --> 00:21.988
from drowning our guests
in vino,

00:22.055 --> 00:23.223
and come here a moment.

00:23.323 --> 00:26.926
Now, how did that get
so empty so fast?

00:27.027 --> 00:28.762
I'll be right back.

00:34.034 --> 00:35.435
That looks good enough
to eat.

00:35.535 --> 00:38.605
Yes, I could say
the same about you.

00:45.378 --> 00:47.881
Mm.

00:47.947 --> 00:49.716
Oh. Voilà.

00:49.783 --> 00:51.351
Ah, it's perfect.

00:51.418 --> 00:55.455
Now, stop stalling and get out
there and read it to them.

00:55.555 --> 00:56.956
Really, Paul.

00:57.057 --> 00:59.526
It seems braggy.

00:59.592 --> 01:01.094
I tell one person
at the embassy,

01:01.194 --> 01:02.929
and it spreads
like gonorrhea.

01:03.029 --> 01:05.231
We're celebrating you tonight,
my darling.

01:05.298 --> 01:06.933
That's why
they're all here.

01:07.033 --> 01:08.301
Yes, I know.

01:08.401 --> 01:13.606
But still, we don't need
to make a meal out of it.

01:14.908 --> 01:16.609
That fish
looks wonderful.

01:16.709 --> 01:17.977
Bon appétit.

01:20.113 --> 01:22.715
Love the capers.

01:22.782 --> 01:26.052
So, when are we going to
hear this famous letter?

01:26.119 --> 01:28.988
Paul can't stop
talking about it.

01:29.089 --> 01:31.157
I know he's your boss,
Heidi, but you must take

01:31.257 --> 01:33.793
everything he says
with a grain of<i> fleur de sel.</i>

01:33.893 --> 01:36.896
Oh, this gravlax is better
than my<i> mormor's,</i>

01:36.963 --> 01:38.331
and if she wasn't
already dead,

01:38.431 --> 01:41.601
she would die if she knew
it was made by an American.

01:41.668 --> 01:43.770
From Pasadena, no less.

01:45.772 --> 01:48.675
Please, Julia,
read it to us.

01:48.775 --> 01:51.077
We're all
so proud of you.

01:51.144 --> 01:53.279
Yes.

01:53.346 --> 01:54.681
Yes, alright.

01:56.950 --> 01:59.285
More Riesling, Anders?

01:59.352 --> 02:01.020
I know, it's a little fruitier
than I expected,

02:01.121 --> 02:03.690
but it's still got balls, and
it's wonderful with the fish.

02:03.790 --> 02:05.325
That's perfect.

02:15.635 --> 02:17.937
"Dear Mrs. Child..."

02:18.004 --> 02:21.174
<i> "We have spent months</i>
<i>looking over your superb</i>

02:21.274 --> 02:25.178

<i>cooking from it --</i>

02:25.278 --> 02:28.214
<i>and we have come to</i>
<i>the conclusion that it is a..."</i>

02:28.314 --> 02:30.550
"...a unique book
that we would..."

02:30.650 --> 02:33.820
drumroll please...

02:33.887 --> 02:36.623
"...be very proud
to have on the Knopf" --

02:36.689 --> 02:38.725
Is it K-nopf or Nopf?

02:38.825 --> 02:40.560
No one k-nows.

02:42.162 --> 02:44.397
Yes, it turns out my time
in France was put to good use.

02:44.497 --> 02:48.334
Paul worked like a dog spreading
American goodwill across Europe

02:48.401 --> 02:49.802
whilst I ate.

02:49.869 --> 02:51.037
Ha!

02:52.472 --> 02:54.641
I'll get it.
Keep reading.

02:54.707 --> 02:57.076
So proud of you,
kitten.

02:57.177 --> 02:59.212
Oh.

02:59.312 --> 03:01.414
"I have been authorized..."

03:01.514 --> 03:02.916
Hello?

03:03.016 --> 03:04.250
"We consider it the best

03:04.350 --> 03:06.186
and only working French cookbook
to date..."

03:06.252 --> 03:09.255
<i>"...which will do for</i>
<i>French cooking here in America</i>

03:09.355 --> 03:11.658
<i>what Rombauer's</i>

<i>once did</i>

03:13.660 --> 03:15.528
"...and we will sell it
that way."

03:15.595 --> 03:17.830
When do we get it
in Norway?

03:17.897 --> 03:20.700
"It is certainly
a beautifully organized,

03:20.767 --> 03:24.270

You have already
revolutionized my --"

03:28.775 --> 03:31.077
Is everything alright,
my love?

03:31.177 --> 03:34.781
That was D.C., summoning me
back for a meeting.

03:38.785 --> 03:41.588
Oh, do you think --
Oh, Paul, does that mean...?

03:41.688 --> 03:43.756
We could be back in Paris
in a month.

03:45.892 --> 03:48.294
We will miss you.

03:49.796 --> 03:51.631
Back to Paris!

03:51.731 --> 03:53.233
Hoorah!

03:53.299 --> 03:54.968
Ah, Paris!

04:06.980 --> 04:09.983
Good morning.

04:27.300 --> 04:29.669
Oh, fudge.

04:29.769 --> 04:31.938
Little devil.

04:38.411 --> 04:41.648
Mmm!
Coffee's wonderful.

04:46.119 --> 04:48.354
Thank you, dear.

04:52.659 --> 04:55.862
You look lovely
this morning.

04:55.962 --> 04:58.264
I'm not camera ready,
as they say.

04:58.331 --> 05:00.033
Nonsense.

05:01.634 --> 05:04.337
Mmm.

05:04.437 --> 05:07.140
I guess the book.
That's why I'm there, isn't it?

05:07.206 --> 05:09.208
To promote the book...

05:09.309 --> 05:11.377
before everyone forgets
about it completely.

05:11.477 --> 05:13.946
Such an old gasbag,
that man.

05:14.013 --> 05:16.015
WGBH is a fine
institution.

05:16.115 --> 05:18.217
It's still television.

05:18.318 --> 05:21.487
It's television.

05:21.554 --> 05:24.390
Avis loves her TV.

05:24.490 --> 05:26.626
She needs company.

05:26.693 --> 05:29.162
Maybe I tell
the sole<i> meunière</i> story

05:29.228 --> 05:31.130
and really milk the part
when I cried

05:31.197 --> 05:32.398
from its sheer
deliciousness

05:32.498 --> 05:35.068
and you didn't know
what was wrong.

05:35.168 --> 05:38.004
Don't besmirch it.

05:38.071 --> 05:40.640
I've told that tale
a thousand times.

05:40.707 --> 05:42.975
It's sort of become
my signature.

05:43.042 --> 05:46.813
It's almost like you took
my virginity twice.

05:46.879 --> 05:50.683
First by fucking me
and then by feeding me.

05:53.653 --> 05:58.524
It's mildly depressing, taking
something so seminal to you,

05:58.591 --> 06:01.661
to us, and turning it into
a television anecdote

06:01.728 --> 06:04.931
for Prince Albert
and his ghastly show.

06:05.031 --> 06:07.100
But you'll watch?

06:07.200 --> 06:09.435
I wouldn't miss it
for the world.

06:09.535 --> 06:11.904
That was delicious,
darling.

06:12.004 --> 06:13.840
Now, wish me luck.

06:13.906 --> 06:18.010
An empty canvas awaits
on the slow train towards death

06:18.077 --> 06:19.679
that is forced retirement.

06:19.746 --> 06:22.215
Yes, you and me both.

06:23.616 --> 06:26.552
Has it really
only been a year?

06:31.891 --> 06:33.626
Ooh.

07:23.509 --> 07:27.013
Hello.
I'm Julia Child.

07:27.113 --> 07:28.481
Yes, Mrs. Child.

07:28.581 --> 07:30.817
If you head down the hallway,
you'll find the green room.

07:30.917 --> 07:33.252
Thank you.

07:33.319 --> 07:35.988
Oh, that's awfully kind of you.
How lovely.

07:36.088 --> 07:38.524
I've made a dozen or so
of your recipes so far.

07:38.624 --> 07:41.661
Never been to France, but now my
husband says we don't have to.

07:41.761 --> 07:43.763
Tell your husband
that Julia Child

07:43.830 --> 07:46.933
says he must
take you to France.

07:46.999 --> 07:48.534
Yes, and that's
an order.

07:53.506 --> 07:56.175
Come in, come in.

07:57.810 --> 07:59.612
Mrs. Child?

07:59.679 --> 08:02.281
I just wanted to come by
and say hello.

08:02.348 --> 08:03.683
Ooh.

08:05.117 --> 08:09.021
It was my small idea
to have you on the show.

08:09.121 --> 08:11.824
Ooh, how lovely.

08:11.891 --> 08:13.125
And your name, dear?

08:13.192 --> 08:15.328
I'm Alice Naman,
associate producer.

08:15.394 --> 08:17.964
If there's anything I can do
for you, please let me know.

08:18.030 --> 08:19.499
It's funny
you should say that.

08:19.565 --> 08:23.369
You wouldn't happen to have
a hot plate, would you?

08:34.680 --> 08:36.382
Do we have
a hot plate?

08:36.482 --> 08:38.351
Julia Child is asking
for a hot plate.

08:38.417 --> 08:39.719
Of course she is.

08:39.819 --> 08:42.088
The BBC is making docs
about prize-winning scientists

08:42.188 --> 08:43.556
while we're peddling
cookbooks.

08:43.656 --> 08:44.891
So, we don't have
a hot plate?

08:44.991 --> 08:46.425
<i>I</i> have a hot plate.

08:46.526 --> 08:49.061
I use it to boil water
for my tea.

08:52.398 --> 08:53.599
Right.

09:00.540 --> 09:03.376
- Okay.
- ...camera two.

09:03.442 --> 09:06.112
Your usual comb.

09:06.212 --> 09:10.249
And we're live in five,
four, three...

09:18.558 --> 09:22.295
Hello. And welcome to
"I've Been Reading."

09:22.395 --> 09:24.463
Class is now
in session.

09:24.564 --> 09:26.232
I'm Albert Duhamel,
of course,

09:26.299 --> 09:28.534
associate arts professor
at Boston College,

09:28.601 --> 09:30.570
and today, we're going
to do something

09:30.636 --> 09:31.871
a little bit different.

09:31.938 --> 09:35.308
Instead of, say, Steinbeck,
Capote, Heller,

09:35.408 --> 09:37.276
or even Rand,

09:37.376 --> 09:40.580
my guest this afternoon
writes cookbooks.

09:40.646 --> 09:44.317
Yes, you heard that correctly.
Cookbooks.

09:44.417 --> 09:46.986
Though, to be frank,
it would be rather disingenuous

09:47.086 --> 09:48.955
for me to say
it's what "I've Been Reading,"

09:49.055 --> 09:52.625
as I have never
actually read a cookbook.

09:52.725 --> 09:55.461
Maybe for today, we'll
rename our little program

09:55.561 --> 09:57.930
"What My Wife's
Been Reading."

09:59.298 --> 10:03.135
No, but seriously, folks,
please welcome my guest,

10:03.235 --> 10:07.573
Cambridge's own,
Mrs. Julia Child.

10:08.941 --> 10:11.844
Duke, what a lovely
introduction.

10:11.944 --> 10:15.014
Yes, isn't that what
your students call you
at the college?

10:15.114 --> 10:17.416
It's<i> très charmant.</i>

10:17.483 --> 10:19.652
Now, not to hijack
the conversation,

10:19.752 --> 10:22.521
but would you happen to know
where the outlet is?

10:22.622 --> 10:24.323
The outlet?

10:24.423 --> 10:26.492
Yes, to plug
something in.

10:26.592 --> 10:29.862
Well, I don't understand.
To plug<i> what</i> in?

10:29.962 --> 10:32.498
Well, this hot plate,
Duke.

10:32.598 --> 10:35.368
Ooh.
There it is.

10:35.468 --> 10:37.169
What is she doing?

10:37.269 --> 10:39.271
Nothing to it
but to do it.

10:39.338 --> 10:44.477
So, I thought I'd make
a classic French omelette.

10:48.014 --> 10:51.350
Are you alright
down there?

10:52.818 --> 10:56.155
I'm not sure the cord's
quite long enough.

10:56.222 --> 10:57.857
That -- Ooh.
Heavens.

10:57.957 --> 11:01.293
Got it. There.
Where were we?

11:01.360 --> 11:02.795
Uh, omelettes?

11:02.862 --> 11:05.798
Omelettes.
Yes. Of course.

11:05.865 --> 11:11.704
I just need this sucker
nice and hot.

11:11.804 --> 11:16.575
A sizzling hot no-stick pan
is essential.

11:16.676 --> 11:18.911
Eh, for making
an omelette?

11:19.011 --> 11:21.380
Well, yes, of course.
Keep up with me, Duke.

11:21.480 --> 11:23.249
Do you like
a good omelette?

11:23.349 --> 11:24.850
Sure. Why not?

11:24.917 --> 11:26.352
Yes, I just love them.

11:26.419 --> 11:30.256
Nothing more, really,
than lightly coagulated eggs.

11:32.224 --> 11:36.228
It's a perfect meal
and a lovely lunch.

11:36.328 --> 11:37.596
Why is she
so out of breath?

11:37.697 --> 11:39.999
What did you have
for your lunch?

11:40.066 --> 11:42.401
Uh, a tuna fish sandwich.

11:42.501 --> 11:45.171
Oh, dear. Well,
I've come just in time.

11:45.237 --> 11:49.408
They're just lovely
and tender and soft,

11:49.508 --> 11:53.345
and, well, they take
barely half a minute.

12:00.219 --> 12:01.620
Oh.

12:01.721 --> 12:03.689
For you,
let's do three.

12:03.756 --> 12:06.258
You look like
a three-egg man to me.

12:06.358 --> 12:10.930
And then some --
some salt.

12:15.134 --> 12:17.136
Fresh-ground pepper.

12:17.236 --> 12:20.239
Don't be shy.
Give it a good whisk.

12:22.475 --> 12:25.311
Would you like to try?

12:25.411 --> 12:26.712
Oh, I'm going to teach you
to whisk

12:26.779 --> 12:30.049
the way I was taught
at Le Cordon Bleu.

12:31.584 --> 12:32.752
Like this?

12:32.818 --> 12:35.888
Oh, put some elbow grease
into it!

12:35.955 --> 12:39.158
Yes. Exactly that.
You're a natural.

12:39.258 --> 12:41.327
I'm French-Canadian.

12:41.427 --> 12:43.562
Yes, well,
golly, it shows.

12:44.964 --> 12:46.332
Oh.

12:48.467 --> 12:49.568
Oh.

12:49.635 --> 12:51.170
<i>See, a great omelette needs</i>

12:51.270 --> 12:53.439
<i>a great amount of butter.</i>

12:53.506 --> 12:55.508
<i>I'd say</i>
<i>a full tablespoon.</i>

12:55.608 --> 12:58.177
<i>And don't be stingy,</i>
<i>baby.</i>

12:58.277 --> 13:02.081
<i>I like to use an inexpensive</i>
<i>no-stick pan.</i>

13:02.148 --> 13:03.516
<i>Don't be fooled by what</i>
<i>I like to call status pans.</i>

13:03.616 --> 13:06.085
Boys!
You've got to see this!

13:06.152 --> 13:08.354
Aunt Julia's on TV!

13:08.454 --> 13:11.423
<i>Let the butter generously</i>
<i>coat the entire surface.</i>

13:11.490 --> 13:14.026
<i>And just before the butter</i>
<i>begins to brown,</i>

13:14.126 --> 13:15.528
<i>we add the eggs.</i>

13:15.628 --> 13:16.929
Fabulous.

13:16.996 --> 13:21.467
And then just gradually
jerk the pan towards you.

13:22.835 --> 13:24.470
Et voilà!

13:26.472 --> 13:28.040
Over she goes.

13:28.140 --> 13:32.378
And there you have it --
an omelette<i> baveuse.</i>

13:33.312 --> 13:36.849
Salivating practically,
just like you are, Duke.

13:36.949 --> 13:39.652
Shall we give it a try?

13:46.892 --> 13:48.460
Mmm!

13:48.527 --> 13:51.063
<i>It's quite good.</i>

13:51.163 --> 13:53.866
<i>In fact, I'm going to enjoy it,</i>
<i>if I do say so myself.</i>

13:53.966 --> 13:56.969
<i>I suggest you get cracking</i>
<i>and do the same.</i>

13:57.036 --> 13:59.805
<i>Oh!</i>
<i>Oh, cracking.</i>

13:59.872 --> 14:01.907
<i>This is Albert Duhamel.</i>

14:02.007 --> 14:04.643
<i>Thank you,</i>
<i>and good day.</i>

14:04.710 --> 14:07.346
<i>Class dismissed.</i>

14:08.848 --> 14:10.583
And we're out.

14:13.219 --> 14:16.255
Oh, dear, I forgot
to talk about the book.

14:16.355 --> 14:19.425
Oh, well.
<i>Que Sera, Sera.</i>

14:19.525 --> 14:21.393
Well, that was
utterly silly.

14:21.493 --> 14:23.896
Now, if you'll
excuse me.

14:28.834 --> 14:31.871
So, I guess
no one's been reading.

14:39.712 --> 14:42.114
To Julia.

14:42.214 --> 14:43.883
Ooh! To me.

14:46.385 --> 14:48.287
It was marvelous fun,
really.

14:48.387 --> 14:49.955
You could tell, honey.

14:50.055 --> 14:52.558
You were radiant,
just glowing.

14:52.625 --> 14:55.060
Honestly,
you seemed so relaxed.

14:55.127 --> 14:57.563
Ha! I'd have been
shaking in my boots.

14:57.630 --> 15:00.299
Hell, I was, sitting
in my goddamn armchair.

15:00.399 --> 15:02.968
Good God, you were
a treasured guest

15:03.068 --> 15:05.638
in living rooms
all over Boston.

15:05.738 --> 15:08.641
Ah! I'm a little jealous
to have shared you.

15:08.741 --> 15:11.310
But I couldn't
be more proud.

15:11.410 --> 15:13.646
Here, here.
That sole<i> meunière</i> story

15:13.746 --> 15:16.582
gets richer and richer
each time she tells it.

15:18.817 --> 15:21.320
What are you
talking about?

15:22.254 --> 15:25.591
She didn't tell the fucking
sole<i> meunière</i> story, Paul.

15:25.658 --> 15:28.994
She made an omelette...
with a hot plate...

15:29.094 --> 15:31.630
on a coffee table.

15:31.730 --> 15:33.666
I mean, if it wasn't
so goddamn illuminating,

15:33.766 --> 15:35.734
it would have been theatre
of the absurd.

15:35.801 --> 15:39.171
But the table
was staggeringly low.

15:39.271 --> 15:42.174
I -- We -- We don't have
a television, Avis.

15:42.274 --> 15:44.410
Oh.

15:44.476 --> 15:45.844
of a burst of creativity
in my studio.

15:45.945 --> 15:48.914
No excuse.
Shame on you, Paul.

15:51.750 --> 15:53.652
<i>Escargot, madame.</i>

16:19.478 --> 16:21.146
What is it, Paulski?

16:21.213 --> 16:23.782
You've barely said two words
since we left the restaurant.

16:23.849 --> 16:26.318
Honestly, I don't care
that you didn't see it.

16:26.385 --> 16:28.554
Really.
You'd know if I was upset.

16:28.654 --> 16:31.323
<i>I'm</i> upset, darling.
Me.

16:31.390 --> 16:34.827
I just feel so damn guilty
about it.

16:36.228 --> 16:39.198
Missing it or lying
about missing it?

16:39.298 --> 16:41.734
Both, you devil.

16:41.834 --> 16:45.804
Oh, forget about it, Paul.
I have, long ago.

16:45.871 --> 16:49.074
And getting a talking-to
like that from Avis.

16:49.174 --> 16:51.243
Honestly.

16:51.343 --> 16:53.712
If we had a television, I would
most definitely have watched it

16:53.812 --> 16:56.015
and been proud,
to boot.

16:56.081 --> 16:58.183
She had no right.

16:58.250 --> 17:01.086
Then let's just
buy one.

17:01.186 --> 17:02.588
What?

17:02.688 --> 17:04.590
A TV, Paul.

17:04.690 --> 17:09.395
We're not suckers, Julia,
falling for the latest fad.

17:09.495 --> 17:12.264
Well, maybe TV's
not a fad.

17:12.364 --> 17:14.099
Good lord,
it has to be.

17:16.268 --> 17:18.337
I know
I'll never buy one.

17:21.573 --> 17:23.442
Well, good night.

17:28.247 --> 17:30.382
Kiss?

17:56.542 --> 17:57.810
Deep breath.

17:59.912 --> 18:03.148
I was covered in sweat again
this morning. Just covered.

18:03.248 --> 18:06.151
It is the most
peculiar feeling.

18:06.251 --> 18:08.153
Deep breath.

18:10.789 --> 18:12.491
And...

18:12.591 --> 18:15.828
Oh, what the heck.
We're both grownups.

18:15.928 --> 18:19.832
I haven't been in the mood,
or, you know, feeling frisky,

18:19.932 --> 18:22.000
but I guess I can chalk that up
to boredom,

18:22.101 --> 18:25.838
retirement in Boston, Paul lying
about watching me on television.

18:25.938 --> 18:28.841
You have no idea
what I'm talking about.

18:28.941 --> 18:30.442
You're absolutely fine.

18:30.509 --> 18:32.411
You're just going
through menopause.

18:32.478 --> 18:34.313
Night sweats,
reduced sex drive --

18:34.413 --> 18:36.849
it's all completely
natural and normal.

18:43.455 --> 18:45.424
Of course.

18:48.127 --> 18:49.495
How embarrassing.

18:56.802 --> 18:59.037
I have to tell you, I feel lucky
to be the benefactor

18:59.138 --> 19:01.940
of all your hard work.

19:02.007 --> 19:05.210
My wife
has your cookbook.

19:07.679 --> 19:09.515
How wonderful.

19:43.248 --> 19:44.750
<i> Hello?</i>

19:46.418 --> 19:48.754
Darling...

19:48.854 --> 19:51.857
I've just come
from the doctor's office.

19:51.924 --> 19:55.727
<i>Oh, not your back again?</i>
<i>Damn.</i>

19:55.827 --> 19:57.930
<i>I really thought raising</i>
<i>the counters in the kitchen</i>

19:58.030 --> 20:00.399
<i>would make</i>
<i>all the difference.</i>

20:01.867 --> 20:05.537
No, it's not my back.
My back's fine.

20:05.604 --> 20:07.072
<i>Oh.</i>

20:07.172 --> 20:09.408
<i>Then what?</i>

20:09.508 --> 20:12.344
<i>Are you alright?</i>
<i>Tell me, kitten.</i>

20:12.411 --> 20:15.013
<i>I'm right here.</i>

20:15.080 --> 20:17.549
Nothing. It's nothing.

20:17.616 --> 20:19.785
Silly me.

20:19.885 --> 20:22.020
Fit as a fiddle.

20:22.087 --> 20:24.456
<i>Strong as an ox.</i>

20:25.557 --> 20:29.127
Yes, everything's
all as it should be.

20:29.228 --> 20:32.130
I just --
I actually called

20:32.231 --> 20:35.234
because I'm off to Savenor's
to pick something up for dinner.

20:35.300 --> 20:38.203
Any requests?

20:39.705 --> 20:41.907
<i>I trust you.</i>

20:41.974 --> 20:44.309
See you later, then.

20:55.921 --> 20:57.756
Julia!

20:57.823 --> 20:59.791
Oh.

20:59.891 --> 21:02.060
Dorothy.

21:02.127 --> 21:04.396
What a delightful
surprise.

21:04.463 --> 21:06.665
I saw you the other day
on "I've Been Reading."

21:06.765 --> 21:09.768
Oh, you're kidding.
You watched that?

21:09.835 --> 21:12.838
It is sort of awful, but it
coincides nicely with nap time.

21:12.938 --> 21:14.673
You were so funny.

21:14.773 --> 21:17.075
Plugging in that hot plate
with your tush right in my face?

21:17.142 --> 21:19.111
Hilarious.

21:20.312 --> 21:22.314
It's nice
to see you.

21:23.782 --> 21:26.818
Oh, I made a French omelette
for Norman this morning.

21:26.918 --> 21:29.021
It came out perfect.

21:35.260 --> 21:38.263
She's magnificent.

21:39.865 --> 21:41.533
I could just eat her up.

21:41.633 --> 21:44.136
Well, if<i> you</i> cooked her,
I bet she'd be delicious.

21:49.308 --> 21:51.810
I saw Dorothy Zinberg
today

21:51.877 --> 21:54.613
coming out of Savenor's
as I was going in.

21:54.680 --> 21:56.381
Was she with
that awful baby?

21:56.481 --> 21:59.117
Oh, Paul,
she was precious.

21:59.184 --> 22:01.853
And you'll never guess.

22:01.953 --> 22:04.790
She saw me on TV.

22:05.991 --> 22:08.660
Even made Norman
an omelette.

22:08.727 --> 22:10.996
That's nice.

22:11.063 --> 22:13.565
I thought so.

22:46.031 --> 22:49.868
<i> "Dear Ms. Naman,</i>
<i>this is Julia Child writing,</i>

22:49.935 --> 22:52.504
<i>co-author of 'Mastering</i>
<i>the Art of French Cooking,'</i>

<i>and whom you so kindly</i>

22:58.377 --> 23:01.213
<i>"Well, no use beating</i>

23:01.279 --> 23:03.382

23:24.903 --> 23:26.538
Julie?

23:26.605 --> 23:28.407
Is that you?

23:29.741 --> 23:31.443
Yes, darling.

23:38.250 --> 23:41.486
Oh, Paulski,
it's marvelous.

23:41.586 --> 23:45.590
And to think my pear clafoutis
helped inspire you.

23:46.825 --> 23:48.794
Get outta here.

23:57.102 --> 24:00.439
<i>"A cooking show that would be</i>
<i>informal, easy, conversational,</i>

24:00.505 --> 24:03.141
<i>and yet timed to the minute.</i>

24:03.241 --> 24:04.843
<i>Because the French</i>
<i>have treated cooking</i>

24:04.943 --> 24:07.179
<i>as a serious profession</i>
<i>as well as an art,</i>

24:07.279 --> 24:10.849

24:10.949 --> 24:13.018
<i>As I conceive of cooking,</i>

24:13.118 --> 24:15.187

<i>Yours..."</i>

24:22.861 --> 24:24.529
Julia Child?

24:24.629 --> 24:26.865
It feels flimsy to me.
Not substantive.

24:26.965 --> 24:28.700
This is public television,
for God's sakes.

24:28.800 --> 24:30.836
Not to sound crass, but if we
were doing an educational show

24:30.936 --> 24:32.537
involving cooking
and food,

24:32.637 --> 24:34.539
shouldn't we go
with someone more relatable?

24:34.639 --> 24:37.209
With a more camera-friendly look
and a less distinctive sound.

24:37.309 --> 24:39.978
Shorter.

24:40.045 --> 24:41.313
I --

24:41.379 --> 24:44.382
Well, I see that,
but the truth of the matter is,

24:44.483 --> 24:47.152
we've gotten 27 letters
from hungry viewers

24:47.219 --> 24:48.720
who want more Julia Child.

24:48.820 --> 24:49.955
Really?

24:50.021 --> 24:51.323
Are you sure
about those numbers?

24:51.389 --> 24:52.824
They're on my desk,
Russ.

24:52.891 --> 24:54.459
I can go get them for you
right now if you want.

24:54.526 --> 24:56.695
I'm surprised 27 people
watch us.

24:56.795 --> 24:59.564
That joke is a no-no.
You know that.

25:07.239 --> 25:09.574
27, huh?

25:11.309 --> 25:14.145
Oh, I did
the craziest thing.

25:14.212 --> 25:17.349
I sort of sent in a proposal
to WGBH

25:17.415 --> 25:19.851
about doing a show
of my own.

25:19.918 --> 25:22.687
A cookery show.

25:22.754 --> 25:25.156
Oh, I was hoping
you'd tell me.

25:25.223 --> 25:27.726
You get a drop of that on me,
and I'll kill ya.

25:27.826 --> 25:30.061
Oh. Well...

25:30.161 --> 25:31.930
What were you thinking?

25:32.030 --> 25:35.166
Well, that's just it.
I wasn't.

25:35.233 --> 25:37.102
Don't you have a cookbook
to write?

25:37.202 --> 25:38.870
Well, to be frank,

25:38.937 --> 25:41.773
I think Simca's lost interest,
like the rest of the world.

25:41.873 --> 25:43.742
Oh.

25:43.842 --> 25:46.678
needed a follow-up --
We're desperately behind.

25:46.745 --> 25:48.914
And yet you're out here,
washing your car.

25:49.014 --> 25:51.216
Yes, well, it wasn't
going to wash itself.

25:51.283 --> 25:53.251
You have a living,
breathing husband.

25:53.351 --> 25:54.853
Who would turn this
into the restoration

25:54.920 --> 25:57.722
of the Sistine Chapel,
and I need the car this year.

25:57.789 --> 26:00.292
Oh! Julia!

26:00.392 --> 26:01.960
Damn it.

26:04.563 --> 26:07.465
Cookbooks need lots of
chocolate recipes, Simca.

26:07.566 --> 26:09.801
The moment of truth.

26:12.904 --> 26:15.407
Superb.

26:18.743 --> 26:20.478
Shit.

26:22.480 --> 26:25.383
I've just taken it
out of the oven, Simca.

26:25.450 --> 26:28.987
It looks...

26:29.087 --> 26:30.555
subpar.

26:30.622 --> 26:33.658
I don't know what you did.
Mine looks<i> incroyable.</i>

26:33.758 --> 26:36.127
What I did is follow
your directions

26:36.227 --> 26:37.762
to the letter, my dear.

26:37.829 --> 26:39.931
Your measurements
have not yielded.

26:39.998 --> 26:41.232
Miss Julia,
you know this.

26:41.299 --> 26:43.468
It's not French to be
so exact, huh?

26:43.568 --> 26:45.570
Well, I couldn't disagree
with you more.

26:45.637 --> 26:47.238
It is the exactitude

26:47.305 --> 26:50.408
that is what makes
French cuisine so elevated.

26:50.475 --> 26:54.012
Yes, but you are are forgetting
the<i> je ne sais quoi.</i>

26:54.112 --> 26:57.949
I can't very well instruct our
readers to have<i> je ne sais quoi.</i>

26:58.016 --> 26:59.851
<i>No?</i>

26:59.951 --> 27:03.588
Oh, Simca,
we can't use a recipe

27:03.655 --> 27:06.825
that I'm not utterly convinced
American women can make

27:06.925 --> 27:09.594
if they precisely follow
the directions.

27:09.661 --> 27:11.696
That's what people love
about the first book --

27:11.796 --> 27:13.865
its dependability.

27:13.965 --> 27:16.267
Is it humid out?

27:19.437 --> 27:22.173
No. Not a cloud
in the sky.

27:22.273 --> 27:24.042
Then I don't know.
Make it again.

27:24.142 --> 27:27.012
<i>I will make it again!</i>
<i>I'll make it 100 times</i>

27:27.112 --> 27:28.847
until I get it
exactly right.

27:28.947 --> 27:30.715
It's only one recipe,
<i>ma cherie.</i>

27:30.815 --> 27:33.284
Oh, it's not one recipe,
<i>ma cherie!</i>

27:33.351 --> 27:35.220
And I am starting to lose
my patience

27:35.320 --> 27:37.355
with your unwillingness
to see that.

27:41.693 --> 27:43.061
Fuck a duck!

28:13.858 --> 28:15.593
Oh, thank goodness
you called back.

28:15.694 --> 28:16.995
I didn't mean to hang up, Simca.

28:17.062 --> 28:19.564
I just -- Well, I lost my cool.
It happens.

28:19.664 --> 28:22.667
I'm a healthy girl
with loads of steam, and...

28:22.734 --> 28:25.904
At this rate,
I'm just deeply concerned

28:26.004 --> 28:28.606
that we'll never finish
our big little project.

28:28.707 --> 28:29.774
<i> Hello?</i>

28:29.874 --> 28:31.076
Hello?
Who is this?

28:31.176 --> 28:34.045
This is Alice Naman
calling from WGBH.

28:37.782 --> 28:41.119
Alice.
It's so good to hear from you.

28:41.219 --> 28:43.121
What gives me
the pleasure?

28:43.221 --> 28:46.257
Well, I received your letter
a few days back, and --

28:46.357 --> 28:49.461
and I was wondering
if you'd be willing to come in

28:49.561 --> 28:51.596
so we can talk
face-to-face?

28:54.766 --> 28:56.768
That sounds lovely.

29:10.582 --> 29:12.050
Good morning.

29:12.117 --> 29:13.885
Mrs. Child.
Alice is expecting you.

29:13.952 --> 29:16.221
She's the first door
on the left.

29:16.287 --> 29:19.657
When's your husband
taking you to France?

29:33.304 --> 29:34.839
Come in.

29:38.576 --> 29:41.012
I have a cake.
Would you mind?

29:41.112 --> 29:42.480
Goodness.

29:49.788 --> 29:54.526
It's called
the Queen of Sheba cake.

29:54.626 --> 29:55.927
Sounds so exotic.

29:55.994 --> 29:57.929
Oh, it's not really.
It's actually quite simple,

29:57.996 --> 29:59.964
which is one of the reasons
I adore it.

30:00.031 --> 30:02.700
It's made primarily of lots
of yummy chocolate and almonds,

30:02.801 --> 30:04.936
and if you ask me, it's the best
darn chocolate cake

30:05.003 --> 30:06.805
you've ever tasted.

30:06.871 --> 30:09.440
Walk with me
to the kitchen.

30:12.477 --> 30:16.447
I read it...right away,

30:16.514 --> 30:20.051
and I could see it, but I'm
the only girl here, Julia.

30:20.151 --> 30:22.053
It's hard for me,
and you have to understand,

30:22.153 --> 30:26.291
it was a challenge just to
get them to take you seriously,

30:26.357 --> 30:28.893
which they barely did.

30:28.993 --> 30:31.830
But we've gotten
27 letters.

30:31.896 --> 30:33.965
Is that a lot?

30:34.032 --> 30:36.734
Really?
Sounds rather meager.

30:36.835 --> 30:38.036
For us.

30:38.136 --> 30:40.972
People, women especially,
want to hear from you.

30:42.407 --> 30:44.709
They do?

30:47.912 --> 30:49.414
Oh.

30:50.715 --> 30:53.818
I'm afraid that is the end
of the good news.

30:56.588 --> 30:58.223
Oh, I see.

30:58.323 --> 31:00.758
They're all
such snobs.

31:00.859 --> 31:03.494
I'm sorry I dragged you
down here for this.

31:03.561 --> 31:06.364
I just...

31:06.431 --> 31:08.766
I wanted to
tell you in person.

31:08.867 --> 31:11.069
Well, thank you.

31:11.169 --> 31:13.938
I'm not giving up.
I'm going to keep pushing.

31:14.038 --> 31:15.940
You're onto something
so big.

31:16.040 --> 31:17.242
I'm just sorry
that my colleagues

31:17.342 --> 31:19.010
don't have the vision
to see it yet.

31:19.077 --> 31:20.445
Oh.

31:21.913 --> 31:24.716
Where are
these gentlemen?

31:27.619 --> 31:29.053
Come.

31:36.895 --> 31:38.429
Is that everyone?

31:38.529 --> 31:39.764
Yes. Yes, it is.

31:39.864 --> 31:41.432
Wonderful.
Then I'll begin.

31:41.532 --> 31:43.201
I've heard from
Miss Naman.

31:43.268 --> 31:45.236
Alice gave me
the diagnosis.

31:45.303 --> 31:47.639
Dead on arrival.

31:47.739 --> 31:50.208
I get it.
I look in the mirror every day.

31:50.275 --> 31:52.644
But I'm not giving up
so easily.

31:52.744 --> 31:54.812
One of the advantages
of looking like me

31:54.913 --> 31:56.080
is that you learn
at a young age

31:56.147 --> 31:58.049
how not to take no
for an answer.

31:58.116 --> 31:59.484
I'm sorry?

31:59.584 --> 32:01.819
Make a trial episode,
and I'll pay for all of it --

32:01.920 --> 32:04.055
food, equipment,
the whole kit and caboodle.

32:04.122 --> 32:09.961
Air it, and if it gets traction,
well, we'll go from there.

32:10.061 --> 32:11.896
What kind of cake is that?

32:11.963 --> 32:13.998
Well, say yes, and not only
will I tell you,

32:14.098 --> 32:15.767
but I'll give you
a most generous serving

32:15.833 --> 32:18.436
of the most delicious<i> gateau</i>
you've ever tasted.

32:18.503 --> 32:20.805
And I'll even
share the recipe.

32:20.905 --> 32:25.643
You see, what makes this dessert
so absolutely wicked

32:25.743 --> 32:28.012
is its simplicity.

32:28.112 --> 32:30.114
Your wife could whip it up,
and it would turn out

32:30.181 --> 32:32.317
just like this one
on her first try.

32:32.417 --> 32:33.651
I'm not married.

32:33.751 --> 32:36.587
Oh, well, then I'll share
the recipe with you.

32:40.925 --> 32:42.694
A trial episode, huh?

32:42.794 --> 32:44.829
I think
it's a brilliant idea.

32:44.929 --> 32:46.831
Oh, really?

32:49.133 --> 32:52.170
Yes.
I wish I had thought of it.

32:52.270 --> 32:54.372
With Mrs. Child
covering the cost,

32:54.472 --> 32:56.874
we have nothing to lose.

32:56.975 --> 32:59.043
Look, we've gotten more letters
for this woman

32:59.143 --> 33:01.145
than any other guest in the
history of "I've Been Reading,"

33:01.212 --> 33:03.514
and that includes
some blue chip authors.

33:05.049 --> 33:08.186
I just want to say, for the
record, I'm against this.

33:08.286 --> 33:09.687
No offense.

33:09.787 --> 33:10.989
But is this really
what we think

33:11.055 --> 33:13.725
public television
should be doing?

33:19.230 --> 33:21.332
Cut me a slice.

33:21.399 --> 33:23.968
Hallelujah!

33:32.844 --> 33:33.978
And?

33:34.045 --> 33:35.580
Mm-hmm.

33:35.680 --> 33:37.682
That's my happy boy.

33:37.749 --> 33:39.650
A funny thing happened.

33:39.717 --> 33:41.886
You'll never guess
who I got a call from.

33:41.986 --> 33:44.255
James Beard.

33:44.355 --> 33:46.224
Though I like the way
your mind works.

33:46.324 --> 33:48.026
And just
out of the blue.

33:48.092 --> 33:49.660
Well, who called,
Jul?

33:49.727 --> 33:50.928
WGBH.

33:51.029 --> 33:53.731
Or rather, Alice Naman,
one of the producers there.

33:53.831 --> 33:55.566
Hmm.

33:55.666 --> 33:58.269
it's the craziest thing.

33:58.369 --> 34:00.772
They want me back.

34:00.872 --> 34:02.440
On "I've Been Reading"?

34:02.540 --> 34:04.375
To promote what?

34:04.442 --> 34:07.245
It'll be years before you and
Simca finish that damn book.

34:07.345 --> 34:08.746
Exactly.

34:08.846 --> 34:11.249
Always two beats
ahead of me.

34:11.349 --> 34:13.785
Apparently, they've gotten
an enormous response

34:13.885 --> 34:16.687
from my little omelette-making
performance.

34:16.754 --> 34:19.624
Enormous?
How enormous?

34:19.724 --> 34:22.393
27 letters.

34:22.460 --> 34:25.096
They want to test giving me
my own show.

34:27.265 --> 34:30.234
Naturally, I was surprised,
but it seems awfully fun,

34:30.301 --> 34:31.969
and I did
love doing it.

34:32.070 --> 34:34.405
But, Paul,

34:34.472 --> 34:37.041
I need you here
to be my partner,

34:37.108 --> 34:39.710
to navigate
all of this for me.

34:39.777 --> 34:43.948
So, I'm forced to retire
and you go back to work?

34:44.048 --> 34:46.818
Darling, darling.

34:49.087 --> 34:50.922
I won't do it
if you don't want me to,

34:50.988 --> 34:55.092
but maybe, together,
and if you don't like it,

34:55.159 --> 34:58.229
even if WGBH chooses to take it
forward, I won't do it.

34:58.296 --> 35:00.665
It'll be your call.

35:02.567 --> 35:05.636
I'm awfully proud
of you.

35:05.736 --> 35:07.738
Truly.

35:07.805 --> 35:10.341
But as merrymaking
as it sounds,

35:10.441 --> 35:13.478
I think it's ultimately
going to end up a distraction

35:13.578 --> 35:16.414
from the serious work
you are doing with Simca.

35:16.481 --> 35:19.584
Oh.

35:19.650 --> 35:21.752
That's God damn huge.

35:21.819 --> 35:23.855
Maybe,
when you finish --

35:23.955 --> 35:26.190
<i>If</i> we finish.

35:26.290 --> 35:28.359
You asked me
to be your partner.

35:28.459 --> 35:30.294
And as your partner,
it would be shameful of me

35:30.361 --> 35:32.463
not to tell you
how I really feel.

35:32.530 --> 35:35.867
And how I really feel
is this, darling --

35:35.967 --> 35:38.870
I don't think
it's a good idea.

35:43.774 --> 35:46.043
Thank you, Paul.

35:47.311 --> 35:50.181
Thank you for being honest
with me.

36:03.628 --> 36:05.663
He didn't think
it was a good idea?

36:05.730 --> 36:06.998
Apparently not.

36:07.064 --> 36:08.733
The proposal you pitched
to them?

36:08.833 --> 36:11.135
Kick me while I'm down,
why don't you?

36:11.202 --> 36:13.738
So, you see,
I'm in rather a pickle.

36:13.838 --> 36:15.373
A Paul pickle.

36:15.473 --> 36:18.042
It's always
a Paul pickle.

36:18.142 --> 36:20.011
Oh.

36:20.077 --> 36:21.746
How much longer?

36:21.846 --> 36:23.481
Well,
it's another mile.

36:23.548 --> 36:24.849
Oh!

36:28.853 --> 36:32.056
Where'd you pick up
this nasty habit?

36:32.156 --> 36:34.258
Shanghai.

36:34.358 --> 36:37.495
They want to shoot a trial
episode, next week, no less.

36:37.562 --> 36:38.896
Oh, shit.

36:38.996 --> 36:41.866
And I do
so want to do it.

36:41.933 --> 36:44.101
I can hardly
explain it.

36:44.202 --> 36:47.104
When I try to put it into words,
it sounds rather banal,

36:47.205 --> 36:49.273
even to me,
but there was something

36:49.373 --> 36:53.211
about being in front of a camera
like that that just felt right.

36:53.277 --> 36:56.280
It was...

36:56.380 --> 36:59.183
as if I came into focus.

36:59.250 --> 37:01.953
That's fucking beautiful.

37:02.053 --> 37:04.689
You may need to help Paul see
what you've articulated

37:04.755 --> 37:06.857
so artfully.

37:06.924 --> 37:08.359
Don't look at me,
honey.

37:08.426 --> 37:10.461
I'm the third wheel
that crashes your dinners.

37:10.561 --> 37:13.698
Oh, nonsense.
You're the one who figured out

37:13.764 --> 37:16.467
how to get
"Mastering" published.

37:16.567 --> 37:18.302
You know
what you need?

37:18.402 --> 37:23.107
You need someone Paul really
respects to rally his troops.

37:23.207 --> 37:26.143
It's time to bring out
the big guns.

37:43.928 --> 37:45.162
Did you grow?

37:45.263 --> 37:47.965
Oh. Oh, girl,
I think you shrank.

37:48.065 --> 37:50.268
Thank you.

37:53.437 --> 37:56.474
Mmm.
That's just lovely.

37:56.574 --> 37:58.509
And that's the thing,
Judith.

37:58.609 --> 38:01.078
We worked on God damn
Part One 10 years,

38:01.145 --> 38:03.514
and we're already fading
from the discussion.

38:03.614 --> 38:05.116
What discussion?

38:05.182 --> 38:07.184
The discussion
of how we eat.

38:07.285 --> 38:10.354
That's not a discussion.
It's never been a discussion.

38:10.454 --> 38:12.657
Your book made it seem like
we could start

38:12.757 --> 38:15.693
having that discussion
for about five minutes.

38:15.793 --> 38:19.764
But it's not a discussion,
as yet, we have in this country.

38:19.830 --> 38:22.333
Well, it ought to be.

38:26.871 --> 38:28.339
Oh.

38:31.642 --> 38:33.144
Thank you.

38:33.210 --> 38:34.545
I'm not wearing
one of those.

38:34.645 --> 38:36.881
Oh, Judith, really.

38:36.981 --> 38:38.282
Part of the fun.

38:38.349 --> 38:40.685
For you, fine.

38:43.020 --> 38:45.856
Sometimes, when I think,
the choices I made

38:45.956 --> 38:50.227
and the choices Paul made,
the choices life made for us,

38:50.328 --> 38:52.563
I fear, at the end of the day,
that it's all going to add up

38:52.663 --> 38:56.067
to nothing more than lying flat
on a shelf of remainders.

38:56.167 --> 38:57.201
Julia.

38:57.301 --> 38:58.703
Ooh, but at this
stage of my life,

38:58.803 --> 39:00.037
I don't want to
feel invisible.

39:00.137 --> 39:01.539
I want to feel relevant.

39:01.639 --> 39:03.507
I want to<i> be</i> relevant.

39:03.574 --> 39:06.977
Well, then,
you have to do it.

39:07.044 --> 39:08.746
Mmm.

39:10.748 --> 39:15.252
Ooh, that drawn butter
is criminally good.

39:15.353 --> 39:18.189
Why, Judith,
a more liberal dipping

39:18.255 --> 39:21.425
will really bring out the
sweetness of the lobster meat.

39:21.525 --> 39:23.594
Allow me.

39:23.694 --> 39:25.396
Mm.

39:25.496 --> 39:29.033
There's more flesh in there if
you're willing to suck it out.

39:30.835 --> 39:33.938
So, how can I
be of service?

39:34.038 --> 39:36.507
So, you came all the way
to Boston for that?

39:36.574 --> 39:38.909
Sometimes, it's better to have
difficult conversations

39:39.009 --> 39:41.445
face-to-face.

39:41.545 --> 39:45.216
Egads!
They were that disappointed?

39:45.282 --> 39:48.252
They were really hoping
you'd consider their offer,

39:48.352 --> 39:52.456
especially as, as they see it,
you have nothing to lose.

39:52.556 --> 39:55.126
Dinner is served.

40:00.865 --> 40:03.601
Ooh. Dark meat?

40:03.701 --> 40:05.603
Mmm. Yum.

40:08.906 --> 40:11.142
It's just one episode.

40:11.242 --> 40:12.810
Our answer is no.

40:12.910 --> 40:15.479
Shoot it next week,
and then you can walk away.

40:15.579 --> 40:17.314
No questions asked.

40:17.415 --> 40:19.316
I said no.

40:19.417 --> 40:22.153
I'm beginning to think the trip
was to see us, not them.

40:22.253 --> 40:23.988
Oh, Paul.

40:24.088 --> 40:27.658
I have enormous respect for you,
for Anne Frank alone,

40:27.758 --> 40:31.495
but how can I be so base
as to let my good wife

40:31.595 --> 40:34.231
hock her wares like
a door-to-door salesman

40:34.298 --> 40:35.833
on television?

40:35.933 --> 40:38.169
Bon appétit,
everyone.

40:38.269 --> 40:40.738
It's public television,
Paul.

40:40.805 --> 40:42.506
Its mandate
is to educate.

40:42.606 --> 40:45.176
As yet, it hasn't figured out
how to do that

40:45.276 --> 40:46.744
without putting people
to sleep.

40:46.811 --> 40:49.513
But this --
this amorphous thing

40:49.613 --> 40:51.649
they're proposing
could be anything.

40:51.749 --> 40:56.187
You two can make it anything
and do something

40:56.287 --> 41:00.691
to better this still-young
country while you're at it.

41:00.791 --> 41:03.928
You were a diplomat
for so many years.

41:03.994 --> 41:06.597
Think of it
as cultural diplomacy.

41:06.664 --> 41:09.934
And Julia
as our<i> attaché.</i>

41:12.036 --> 41:13.170
Diplomacy?

41:13.270 --> 41:15.706
That's what it is,
isn't it?

41:18.476 --> 41:24.114
Our time in France changed us
both in such a profound way.

41:24.181 --> 41:26.484
What we eat is
so deeply connected

41:26.550 --> 41:28.319
to how we see ourselves,

41:28.385 --> 41:32.656
to our -- our role
in our society.

41:32.723 --> 41:34.492
Imagine...

41:34.558 --> 41:36.560
So true.

41:36.660 --> 41:40.164
And yet, I've never heard it
articulated so beautifully.

41:40.231 --> 41:41.365
Ow!

41:41.465 --> 41:43.334
I can almost see it.

41:43.400 --> 41:46.570
Earthen,
yet international.

41:47.905 --> 41:51.709
A budding rose in
a forest of dandelions.

41:51.809 --> 41:53.911
A beacon
shining her light

41:54.011 --> 41:56.514
into the darkness
of the American kitchen.

41:56.580 --> 41:58.482
It's too much, Paul.

41:58.549 --> 42:03.087
I really think your original
impulse was the right one.

42:03.187 --> 42:06.557
Can't even fathom it
at this point of our lives.

42:06.657 --> 42:08.592
But you're a star.

42:14.932 --> 42:16.400
So, should we say yes?

42:16.500 --> 42:18.269
It has to be rarefied.

42:18.369 --> 42:19.937
And Francophile.

42:20.037 --> 42:21.605
Of course.

42:21.705 --> 42:24.208
If she's going to do it,
she needs to do it right.

42:24.275 --> 42:25.943
Keep it smart.
Keep it true.

42:26.043 --> 42:28.612
At the same time, my love,
I do think it should be a show

42:28.712 --> 42:31.215
where any old American housewife
in the country

42:31.282 --> 42:33.551
can make whatever it is
I'm making.

42:33.617 --> 42:36.186
Brilliant.
French food for everyone,

42:36.253 --> 42:38.789
not just the White House.

42:38.889 --> 42:42.793
And yet, at the same time,
highly discerning.

42:42.893 --> 42:44.295
Highly.

42:46.297 --> 42:48.198
You can see it,
can't you?

42:48.265 --> 42:49.967
Nope.

42:51.235 --> 42:52.236
Yes.

43:02.146 --> 43:04.048
To Julia.

43:04.114 --> 43:06.951
And her
Michelin chicken.

43:07.051 --> 43:08.819
To Julia.

43:12.957 --> 43:14.291
To us.

43:52.863 --> 43:55.532
We should show it
to some people.

43:55.633 --> 43:57.601
A gallery.

43:59.637 --> 44:02.373
This is your moment,
Paul.

44:33.170 --> 44:35.739
Paul. Paul. Dear.

44:35.839 --> 44:37.207
Hmm? Oh.

44:37.307 --> 44:41.045
Mm. Mm. Mm.

44:46.083 --> 44:48.919
Mm. No. No.

44:49.019 --> 44:50.220
What?

44:50.320 --> 44:53.223
What?

45:09.606 --> 45:10.908
Perfect.

45:42.106 --> 45:43.407
Hello, dear.

45:43.474 --> 45:45.876
I'm hoping you can help me
deposit this royalty check.

45:50.380 --> 45:52.649
My cookbook.
I wrote a cookbook.

45:52.750 --> 45:54.318
Must be some book.

46:11.769 --> 46:14.138
Hello, young man.

46:16.573 --> 46:18.509
I'd like to buy
a television.

46:18.609 --> 46:21.845
If you'll follow me.
