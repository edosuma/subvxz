00:00.960 --> 00:03.600
Previously on:

00:03.630 --> 00:05.790
In just a few months,
you're gonna have a baby.

00:05.820 --> 00:07.270
Yeah,I know.

00:07.305 --> 00:09.180
And if what you want
to do is keep that baby,

00:09.200 --> 00:11.620
just know that that baby
is your respsibility.

00:11.640 --> 00:14.570
George,it's time you move out
and find your own place.

00:14.610 --> 00:16.300
Do you still want to get married?

00:16.300 --> 00:17.670
Yeah,of course.

00:17.690 --> 00:18.720
We have to elope.

00:18.740 --> 00:20.120
You can go out with Ricky

00:20.130 --> 00:22.390
as long as know where you
are and what you're doing.

00:22.400 --> 00:23.080
Really?

00:23.110 --> 00:24.820
Ben and I are getting married.

00:24.840 --> 00:26.050
You can't tell Mom or Dad.

00:26.070 --> 00:27.390
We're getting fake IDs.

00:27.410 --> 00:28.880
You think you can get away with this?

00:28.910 --> 00:30.180
I was wondering--

00:30.200 --> 00:32.430
Would you like to hang
at Ben's tonight?

00:36.110 --> 00:38.630
You cannot turn my garage
into your apartment.

00:38.640 --> 00:40.590
I want to be around my girls.

00:40.610 --> 00:43.510
I thought this would give you
your space and I'd have my space.

00:43.550 --> 00:45.280
I can't wait to marry you.

00:45.315 --> 00:48.690
It's a party,Alice,
all right? Let lo enjoy it.

00:49.980 --> 00:52.520
I now pronounce you man and wife.

00:52.530 --> 00:55.460
Amy and Ben Boykewich.

00:57.310 --> 00:59.100
We're next.

01:01.220 --> 01:03.710
You can't get married.
It's your first date.

01:03.750 --> 01:05.160
We can't get married?

01:05.180 --> 01:07.010
You don't know her,Tom.

01:07.060 --> 01:08.330
I don't know him either.

01:08.350 --> 01:09.640
But we d'tt  care about that.

01:09.680 --> 01:12.670
You don't care that you don't
know her and she doesn't know you?

01:12.690 --> 01:13.920
You don't know each other.

01:13.960 --> 01:16.940
How many ways can
she say the same thing?

01:19.580 --> 01:21.410
Did you give her my promise ring?

01:21.440 --> 01:22.590
- Did I?
- Did u?

01:22.620 --> 01:23.870
He did.

01:23.900 --> 01:25.600
Tom,I'm gonna want that ring back.

01:25.610 --> 01:31.420
Why? Afraid you'll accidentally
have sex with Ricky?

01:31.460 --> 01:32.800
Accidental sex?

01:32.810 --> 01:34.950
There's no such th sg as accidental sex.

01:34.990 --> 01:36.980
Isn't that why we are here?

01:37.000 --> 01:38.450
I just want my ring back.

01:38.490 --> 01:40.570
Finder keepers,losers weepers.

01:40.740 --> 01:41.930
You know what? Listen up,you two.

01:41.950 --> 01:43.090
Okay,you're not getting married.

01:43.120 --> 01:45.760
You don't even know each
other,okay? We have to go home.

01:45.800 --> 01:46.990
No,we don't.

01:47.010 --> 01:48.910
Not until we are married.

01:48.960 --> 01:52.600
This is love at first sight.

01:52.640 --> 01:53.920
Yeah.

01:54.400 --> 01:55.840
Could you talk to him,please?

01:55.850 --> 01:58.800
Hey,if he wants to
get married,who am I to--?

01:59.100 --> 02:00.870
Okay,I'll talk to him.

02:02.490 --> 02:05.740
Tom,you know your parents would
be very upset with you

02:05.780 --> 02:08.820
if you just get married without
them knowing about it.

02:08.830 --> 02:10.310
Yeah,we have to call them.

02:10.350 --> 02:11.410
Although I'd rather not.

02:11.430 --> 02:14.080
I'd rather you two just give up
on this so we can go home.

02:14.130 --> 02:16.730
TO Call them.
Invite tIn to the wedding.

02:26.720 --> 02:27.890
What's wrong?

02:27.930 --> 02:29.570
Mom,I don't know what to do.

02:29.580 --> 02:31.560
This wedding we came to,
it's at a public chapel,

02:31.600 --> 02:33.940
and now Tom is trying to marry Tammy.

02:33.970 --> 02:35.380
come on.

02:35.430 --> 02:37.650
No,it's true,and I can't get
the two of them out of here.

02:37.690 --> 02:39.850
Tom is insisting on marrying her.

02:39.890 --> 02:42.740
And Mom,he can,I mean,he's over 18.

02:42.750 --> 02:44.140
Honey,don't be ridiculous.

02:44.160 --> 02:46.560
Who would marry Tom and
Tammy on their first date?

02:46.580 --> 02:48.710
Elbert of Elbertson's Wedding Chapel.

02:48.750 --> 02:50.260
Mom,I'm sorry,I hate to
ask you to do this,

02:50.300 --> 02:52.470
but I think you really,
really need to get down here.

02:52.520 --> 02:54.510
The wedding was at Elbertson's?

02:54.540 --> 02:57.530
Someone actually got married
at Elbertson's Wedding Chapel?

02:57.570 --> 02:59.370
Amy.

02:59.400 --> 03:00.700
Amy and Ben.

03:00.720 --> 03:02.410
**

03:02.420 --> 03:04.300
Mom,it's a long story. I don't--

03:04.340 --> 03:06.140
I don't even know
if their parents know yet.

03:08.410 --> 03:10.780
Hi,Mom.

03:10.810 --> 03:14.060
I'm sorry you can't be here.
It's the breaks.

03:14.070 --> 03:16.410
Tom,I would really like
to be at your wedding.

03:16.450 --> 03:18.610
And your father would really
like to be at your wedding.

03:18.620 --> 03:19.870
Would you wait for us,please?

03:19.920 --> 03:22.150
- I guess.
- I'll be right there.

03:28.330 --> 03:29.490
Juergens.

03:29.520 --> 03:30.950
George Juergens.

03:36.510 --> 03:37.500
Yeah?

03:37.540 --> 03:39.760
Are you aware that your
daughter is getting married

03:39.800 --> 03:42.670
or just got married at
Elbertson's Wedding Chapel?

03:42.710 --> 03:43.680
Who is this?

03:43.720 --> 03:45.450
- Kathleen.
- How do you know?

03:45.500 --> 03:48.230
Grace was there-- Or is there.

03:48.240 --> 03:50.280
I just thought I should call you.

03:53.710 --> 03:55.490
Waste not,want not.

04:03.490 --> 04:04.560
Yeah,hello.

04:04.600 --> 04:07.130

How'd you get hooked up with Madison?

04:55.370 --> 04:58.400
Um,I'm just a lazy dater.

04:58.430 --> 05:00.230
What can I tell you?

06:06.320 --> 06:09.460
I present Mr. and Mrs. Ben Boykewich.

06:23.600 --> 06:25.180
Hey.

06:25.810 --> 06:27.710
What happened?
I stopped by the restaurant.

06:27.730 --> 06:29.650
Uh-huh. When?

06:29.670 --> 06:30.320
Just now.

06:30.370 --> 06:31.420
Just now?

06:31.440 --> 06:33.860
Two hours after you were
supposed to meet us?

06:34.850 --> 06:36.450
So how'd it go?

06:36.480 --> 06:38.650
Well,your mother had to leave.

06:38.670 --> 06:40.230
She had a plane to catch.
She's working.

06:40.250 --> 06:43.280
Yeah,I know that. But how'd it go?

06:43.320 --> 06:45.390
How was it,seeing her and everything?

06:45.420 --> 06:47.290
She looks good,huh?

06:47.350 --> 06:48.110
What?

06:48.160 --> 06:50.480
You two haven't seen
each other in a long time.

06:50.530 --> 06:52.000
So,what does that
have to do with you?

06:52.020 --> 06:54.030
I don't know,everything?

06:54.060 --> 06:55.650
Yeah,I'm married.

06:55.660 --> 06:58.160
And dinner tonight was supposed
to be with you and your mother

06:58.210 --> 07:00.010
so the three of us could talk.

07:00.030 --> 07:02.060
Your mother let me wait here for you.

07:02.110 --> 07:03.430
I still want to talk to you.

07:03.470 --> 07:04.840
Well,I had to go to a wedding.

07:04.900 --> 07:06.450
A wedding? That's where you were?

07:06.460 --> 07:08.000
Your mother didn't say
anything about a wedding.

07:08.050 --> 07:09.830
Yeah. Amy and Ben got married.

07:10.890 --> 07:12.350
Amy.

07:12.390 --> 07:14.390
The girl who's having Ricky's baby?

07:15.412 --> 07:16.320
Who's Ben?

07:16.340 --> 07:19.160
Oh,that's her boyfriend.
I mean,husband.

07:19.180 --> 07:20.260
How old are they?

07:20.310 --> 07:21.480
Fifteen.

07:21.490 --> 07:23.250
Two 15-year-olds got married?

07:23.290 --> 07:23.850
Yep.

07:23.880 --> 07:25.160
And who were the witnesses?

07:25.210 --> 07:27.730
Her sister and his best friend.

07:27.760 --> 07:29.420
And how old are they?

07:29.450 --> 07:34.710
I think her sister's,like,13
and his best friend's 15.

07:34.730 --> 07:36.430
***

07:36.870 --> 07:38.580
So where'd they get married?

07:38.610 --> 07:40.280
- Elbertson's.
- Really?

07:40.310 --> 07:41.980
Really,and then I stopped
by the reception.

07:42.030 --> 07:43.900
I take it their parents were involved.

07:43.940 --> 07:45.190
No.

07:45.220 --> 07:45.770
I see.

07:45.840 --> 07:48.960
Yeah,well,her dad and his dad
showed up afterwards.

07:48.990 --> 07:52.980
They weren't all that happy,
but too late.

07:53.040 --> 07:55.460
Well,I don't know
if it's too late,but--

07:55.500 --> 07:56.640
But why are you so happy?

07:56.680 --> 07:58.490
Because Amy is married.

07:58.540 --> 08:02.320
She's having Ricky's baby,
but still she's married.

08:02.350 --> 08:04.140
So now it's Ben's baby.

08:04.190 --> 08:05.610
Or it will be.

08:05.660 --> 08:06.830
You still have feelings for Ricky

08:06.850 --> 08:09.840
even though he betrayed you and
is dating your only friend?

08:09.870 --> 08:12.580
No,I don't have feelings for Ricky.

08:13.630 --> 08:15.660
I hate to tell you this...

08:17.200 --> 08:18.840
So I won't.

08:19.700 --> 08:23.230
So I'm guessing
the newlyweds used fake IDs?

08:23.300 --> 08:25.070
I don't know,I guess so.

08:25.660 --> 08:28.440
So what? Other people have fake IDs.

08:28.490 --> 08:30.480
Other people are not my concern.

08:30.500 --> 08:31.310
You are.

08:31.330 --> 08:32.799
I don't use it.

08:32.850 --> 08:34.400
- Give it to me.
- No.

08:34.450 --> 08:35.620
Why would you need one?

08:35.650 --> 08:38.000
I don't need one,
I just like having one.

08:38.049 --> 08:41.309
So if you wanted to have a drink,
you would have a drink.

08:41.330 --> 08:43.299
Or if you wanted to go to
a bar or something like that,

08:43.340 --> 08:45.300
you would just go to
a bar,right? No big deal.

08:45.360 --> 08:47.200
Right,no big deal.

08:47.250 --> 08:51.160
You know the penalty for using
a fake ID can be a $250 fine

08:51.190 --> 08:53.480
and/or community service?

08:53.530 --> 08:55.310
- Give it to me.
- No.

08:55.340 --> 08:57.580
Adrian,give it to me
before you get into trouble.

08:57.630 --> 08:59.440
I'm not gonna get into trouble.

08:59.480 --> 09:00.720
So where'd you get it,huh?

09:00.780 --> 09:03.820
Where did you and all your
little friends get fake IDs?

09:03.850 --> 09:05.700
Someone running a shop at school?

09:05.760 --> 09:08.730
All right,I'll giveou my ID,
but don't ask me where I got it

09:08.780 --> 09:11.560
and don't get anyone into any trouble.

09:11.620 --> 09:12.730
Oh,really.

09:12.760 --> 09:14.110
A plea bargain?

09:15.890 --> 09:17.840
Nevada?

09:17.860 --> 09:20.730
Yeah,I don't plea
bargain cases I can win.

09:21.210 --> 09:22.810
What does that mean?

09:23.630 --> 09:25.510
Your mother thinks you
should remain in school

09:25.550 --> 09:27.120
until the end of the year.

09:27.150 --> 09:29.030
And then,depending on how things go,

09:29.080 --> 09:32.330
maybe you should come and
stay with me for a while.

09:32.360 --> 09:33.850
Or,

09:33.930 --> 09:36.210
depending on how things go,

09:36.620 --> 09:39.070
maybe you should come and
live with us for a while.

09:39.120 --> 09:42.140
Adrian,I'm married,okay?

09:42.160 --> 09:43.060
You know that.

09:43.110 --> 09:45.490
Yeah,I know that.

09:48.640 --> 09:50.450
This is not the way to do things.

09:50.500 --> 09:52.040
It was the only way to do things.

09:52.070 --> 09:54.650
I wanted to tell you,but Amy
didn't want me to tell you.

09:54.710 --> 09:56.270
She didn't want anyone to stop us.

09:56.300 --> 09:57.780
Don't ever say that again to me.

09:57.830 --> 10:00.150
Don't ever say that you wanted
to do the right thing,

10:00.190 --> 10:02.570
but Amy or someone else,
or anyone else,

10:02.600 --> 10:03.580
talked you out of it.

10:03.600 --> 10:05.020
You know the right thing to d

10:05.060 --> 10:07.250
You do the right thing. Always.

10:07.280 --> 10:09.060
Right or wrong,we're married.

10:09.110 --> 10:11.280
Married? You're not married,Benjamin.

10:11.340 --> 10:12.630
- I am.
- Son,

10:12.660 --> 10:14.620
if you got married with
an illegal document,

10:14.660 --> 10:17.050
and you had to have been
married with an illegal document,

10:17.100 --> 10:18.540
like a fake ID,

10:18.570 --> 10:19.710
then you're not married.

10:19.740 --> 10:21.600
You're not married and
you're in trouble.

10:21.630 --> 10:23.170
- With?
- With me.

10:23.210 --> 10:24.860
I've told you before.

10:24.900 --> 10:26.720
You can't always have what you want.

10:26.760 --> 10:27.590
That's life.

10:27.620 --> 10:29.190
You don't get to be married to Amy.

10:29.270 --> 10:30.990
Her parents don't want her married.

10:31.010 --> 10:34.390
I tried to help you with
this and the answer was no.

10:34.440 --> 10:36.480
And then you went against
her parents' wishes,

10:36.520 --> 10:40.090
and you lied to me and you
betrayed my trust in you.

10:40.140 --> 10:41.850
We're not married?

10:41.890 --> 10:43.060
You're not married.

10:43.110 --> 10:46.510
Have you paid attention to
anything I just said to you?

10:46.550 --> 10:48.020
Are you sure we're not married?

10:48.950 --> 10:50.120
I'm sure.

10:50.130 --> 10:52.560
But we exchanged vows.

10:52.580 --> 10:54.440
I mean,we said,"I do."

10:54.470 --> 10:57.700
We're married,I don't care what
the State of California says.

10:58.360 --> 11:00.700
Do you care what I say?

11:01.240 --> 11:02.990
You're not married.

11:03.040 --> 11:04.460
Let's go.

11:26.310 --> 11:28.090
Why Nevada?

11:28.130 --> 11:30.860
I don't know,but I wish I was there.

11:30.880 --> 11:32.760
Me too.

11:34.110 --> 11:36.210
You really thought you could
get married with a fake ID?

11:36.250 --> 11:38.270
I did get married with a fake ID.

11:38.310 --> 11:38.900
No,you didn't.

11:38.920 --> 11:40.790
- Yes,I did.
- Doesn't count.

11:40.810 --> 11:41.660
It counts to me.

11:41.700 --> 11:43.580
I mean legally,it doesn't count.

11:43.620 --> 11:46.310
We promised we'd stay with
each other until death.

11:46.340 --> 11:47.980
Yeah,so did your mother and me.

11:48.020 --> 11:49.730
And by the way,
you're both in big trouble

11:49.760 --> 11:51.360
if she finds out about this.

11:51.390 --> 11:53.120
If? I'm not gonna tell her.

11:53.140 --> 11:55.080
I've got enough problems
with her already.

11:56.000 --> 11:58.070
"Sally-Ann Sweetwater"?

12:09.350 --> 12:11.630
Hanging out with your
dad at his new place?

12:11.650 --> 12:12.740
Yeah.

12:13.970 --> 12:15.830
- How'd it go?
- Fine.

12:15.860 --> 12:18.120
This was Ashley's first date,

12:18.140 --> 12:19.830
so I just want to know how it went.

12:19.850 --> 12:21.070
Fine.

12:21.090 --> 12:21.740
What did you do?

12:21.770 --> 12:23.660
We just hung out at Ben's house.

12:23.710 --> 12:24.960
What's his house like?

12:24.980 --> 12:26.340
Big.

12:26.360 --> 12:27.350
How big?

12:27.370 --> 12:29.900
Bigger than ours. Bigger than Dad's.

12:32.480 --> 12:33.730
Goodnight,then.

12:33.780 --> 12:34.840
Well,wait a minute.

12:34.870 --> 12:36.760
You guys want some pancakes?

12:36.790 --> 12:38.420
Mom,it's 1 in the morning.

12:38.460 --> 12:40.020
Are you craving anything?

12:40.060 --> 12:41.160
I always crave pancakes.

12:41.190 --> 12:43.610
And pancakespa great
at 1 in the morning.

12:43.640 --> 12:46.980
Come on,I want to
know how her date went.

12:47.440 --> 12:49.480
Wait a minute,why didn't
Mr. Boykewich drive you home

12:49.520 --> 12:50.930
or have his driver drive you home?

12:50.970 --> 12:53.130
Uh,it was late,so I just called Dad.

12:53.770 --> 12:55.290
Hidey-ho.

12:55.940 --> 12:58.030
- Get your own bathroom.
- No time to chat.

12:59.450 --> 13:01.380
Mom,I'm really tired.

13:01.420 --> 13:03.300
I should just get some sleep.

13:06.390 --> 13:08.450
Look,it-- It was fine,Mom.

13:08.470 --> 13:10.600
It was-- It was great.

13:11.580 --> 13:13.240
Goodnight.

13:13.630 --> 13:14.870
Goodnight.

13:19.430 --> 13:21.320
Grace has a fake ID.

13:22.510 --> 13:23.890
Everyone has one.

13:23.940 --> 13:26.260
You ruined my night,

13:26.290 --> 13:28.110
and I'm going to ruin your night.

13:28.150 --> 13:30.590
- You already did.
- You ruined my life!

13:30.640 --> 13:32.170
I did not!

13:32.210 --> 13:34.620
Grace,why would
you need a fake ID?

13:34.640 --> 13:36.590
Not to get married.

13:36.620 --> 13:39.420
Nobody wants to marry her.

13:39.450 --> 13:44.160
But somebody wants to marry me.

13:44.210 --> 13:45.820
Tom,can you go upstairs

13:45.850 --> 13:47.620
so that we can talk
to Grace alone,please?

13:47.650 --> 13:52.230
Yeah,I will go upstairs
and call my Tammy.

13:52.260 --> 13:54.420
No,it's late,her mother
is not very happy with you.

13:54.460 --> 13:55.810
Do not call Tammy right now.

13:55.850 --> 13:57.410
I am a grownup.

13:57.450 --> 13:59.370
And so is Tammy.

13:59.410 --> 14:03.920
And if it's too late,
she won't answer her phone.

14:04.360 --> 14:05.830
Hello?

14:05.850 --> 14:07.320
It's me,your father,remember?

14:07.370 --> 14:09.780
said do not call Tammy right now.

14:09.800 --> 14:10.520
Give me your cell phone.

14:10.560 --> 14:11.250
What?

14:11.280 --> 14:13.390
You heard me,Give me
your cell phone,now.

14:13.440 --> 14:14.820
- No.
- Tom,

14:14.840 --> 14:16.860
this is not a casual suggestion.

14:16.910 --> 14:19.590
Give me your cell phone,now.

14:24.050 --> 14:25.690
The battery's dead.

14:26.490 --> 14:28.260
All right,you. Upstairs,right now.

14:28.300 --> 14:29.480
We'll talk about this tomorrow.

14:29.520 --> 14:30.820
Yeah,call me.

14:30.840 --> 14:32.130
Ha.

14:35.280 --> 14:36.850
Yeah,that was a great idea.

14:36.880 --> 14:38.660
Getting Tom a girlfriend.

14:38.690 --> 14:40.680
He deserves to have a
relationship with someone

14:40.710 --> 14:41.890
other than the three of us.

14:41.930 --> 14:43.300
Mm,I liked Betty better.

14:43.350 --> 14:46.370
Me too. at Tammy's a bad influen.

14:47.330 --> 14:48.160
What?

14:48.190 --> 14:49.430
A fake ID?

14:49.480 --> 14:51.060
Where did you get a fake ID?

14:51.080 --> 14:53.040
At school. It's no big deal.

14:53.080 --> 14:54.510
It's illegal.

14:54.520 --> 14:55.730
Even to have it in my purse?

14:55.780 --> 14:57.060
even if I don't use it?

14:57.100 --> 14:59.700
- Nevada?
- They all say Nevada.

15:00.800 --> 15:03.140
"Sally-Anne Sweetwater?"

15:04.260 --> 15:05.960
I'm delighted you two think this is funny,

15:06.000 --> 15:08.590
but you won't think it's very
funny when you get caught.

15:08.620 --> 15:10.030
It's illegal. Yo'ure breaking the law.

15:10.070 --> 15:12.590
Do you realize if you get caught
with this,it's a $250 fine?

15:12.640 --> 15:14.460
- Who's going to catch her?
- Oh,I don't know,

15:14.500 --> 15:16.800
A man,wears a uniform,
carries a gun,wears a badge.

15:16.840 --> 15:19.230
Marshall,I think you're making
too big a deal out of this.

15:19.270 --> 15:21.090
That right? How about when
I found out it was you

15:21.120 --> 15:23.250
that cheated on George,
not the other way around?

15:23.300 --> 15:24.340
Was I making a big deal--?

15:24.370 --> 15:25.850
You said you'd never bring that up.

15:25.890 --> 15:26.610
Oops.

15:26.640 --> 15:27.810
Am I old enough to hear this?

15:27.870 --> 15:31.140
You're 27 years old
in Nevada,you're old enough.

15:31.180 --> 15:33.980
Your father is never gonna
let you forget this.

15:39.140 --> 15:41.960
Dad,I'm sorry,I didn't know
it was illegal to have this.

15:42.000 --> 15:43.850
You don't look sorry.

15:46.170 --> 15:47.900
Well,that's because

15:47.940 --> 15:49.440
I'm in love.

15:50.090 --> 15:51.240
Oh,please.

15:51.270 --> 15:53.360
No,Ricky told me tonight
that he loves me.

15:53.400 --> 15:55.090
And I love him,Dad.

15:55.120 --> 15:56.260
We're in love.

15:56.310 --> 15:57.800
Where's your promise ring?

15:57.830 --> 15:59.720
Oh,Tom gave it to Tammy.

15:59.760 --> 16:01.180
We'll be getting that back.

16:01.210 --> 16:03.450
Okay,Dad,whatever you say.

16:04.510 --> 16:06.120
Goodnight.

16:09.020 --> 16:11.370
Maybe we should give it to your mother.

16:16.880 --> 16:18.530
Oh.

16:18.540 --> 16:21.040
Look who's here.

16:21.640 --> 16:22.910
Can I come in?

16:22.940 --> 16:25.620
I don't know. Can you?

16:26.210 --> 16:28.520
Yes,I can.

16:39.540 --> 16:41.340
I decided to take a shower
while I had the chance.

16:41.380 --> 16:42.580
Yeah,whatever.

16:42.600 --> 16:44.310
You want some pancakes?

16:44.360 --> 16:45.990
Pancakes?

16:46.020 --> 16:48.580
Yeah. I could put some
blueberries in if you want.

16:48.600 --> 16:50.220
Wow.

16:50.230 --> 16:52.740
What would make you offer
me blueberry pancakes?

16:52.790 --> 16:55.590
I made them for the girls
but they were tired and went to bed.

16:55.630 --> 16:57.210
I'm kind of tired myself.

16:57.250 --> 16:59.410
I better get to bed too.
Wait a minute.

17:00.800 --> 17:02.110
You wanna talk?

17:02.160 --> 17:03.270
Talk?

17:03.310 --> 17:04.819
Yeah,talk.

17:04.859 --> 17:07.000
Why doesn't anyone want
to talk to me around here?

17:07.030 --> 17:09.140
You're not that fun to talk to.

17:09.180 --> 17:11.530
I can be.

17:13.540 --> 17:14.690
Wow!

17:14.730 --> 17:15.540
Yeah.

17:15.569 --> 17:17.230
I should have moved
out here years ago.

17:17.290 --> 17:19.170
Who knew garage
sex could be like this?

17:19.220 --> 17:20.440
Look,George,

17:20.500 --> 17:22.760
just because we had great
sex for the first time in years

17:22.810 --> 17:24.339
does not mean we're
getting back together.

17:24.380 --> 17:26.089
Oh,no,not at all.
In fact,I think we should

17:26.119 --> 17:28.700
stay at least this far apart.
That was unbelievable.

17:28.740 --> 17:31.100
Yeah,unbelievable.

17:32.100 --> 17:33.770
But we shouldn't have.

17:33.810 --> 17:35.290
We really shouldn't have.

17:35.350 --> 17:37.200
Oh,no,we should have,
we really should have.

17:37.250 --> 17:38.750
It's time to forgive and forget.

17:38.770 --> 17:41.000
Oh,no.,No,no,n

17:41.040 --> 17:42.090
You're not forgiven.

17:42.130 --> 17:43.290
Come on,I'm forgiven.

17:43.330 --> 17:44.580
- No,you're not.
- Why not?

17:44.600 --> 17:45.580
Because you're not.

17:45.620 --> 17:47.390
I'm sure you haven't forgiven me.

17:47.410 --> 17:48.980
Forgiven you for what?

17:51.730 --> 17:53.780
Chicago! I knew it!

17:53.810 --> 17:55.630
Yeah,I know you knew it.

17:55.680 --> 17:57.130
You knew it,right?

17:57.160 --> 17:59.600
What happened? And tell
me the truth. I told you the truth.

17:59.640 --> 18:01.490
Yeah,after you got caught.

18:02.360 --> 18:04.560
Nothing happened,okay,
I had dinner with him.

18:04.600 --> 18:06.080
I didn't sleep with him.

18:06.120 --> 18:07.710
You're lying.

18:08.850 --> 18:10.720
Yeah,I'm lying.

18:11.130 --> 18:12.800
We're even.

18:15.350 --> 18:19.350
I almost added "I'm sorry,"
but I'm not sorry.

18:19.360 --> 18:22.040
It's just something
I had to do,George.

18:22.080 --> 18:24.060
For me.

18:28.220 --> 18:30.390
You really should move out.

18:31.840 --> 18:32.930
Oh,not now.

18:32.960 --> 18:34.260
Never gonna happen!

18:34.300 --> 18:35.800
Never!

Hey,Adrian.

20:29.070 --> 20:32.010
We're all friends because
you're a gracious person.

20:32.050 --> 20:33.370
Because you have a lot
of really,really good things

20:42.780 --> 20:45.010
So did you go to the wedding

It was great,well,until Ben's
dad and Amy's dad showed up.

Then it was just over pretty quickly.

20:49.780 --> 20:52.410

21:04.120 --> 21:06.560
???interested in Jack.

21:06.600 --> 21:10.500
I'm interested in someone else.

21:10.530 --> 21:12.240
Oh,who is it?

21:12.280 --> 21:14.010
No one you know.

21:14.020 --> 21:15.960
Hey,I heard Mr. Molina is back.

21:15.980 --> 21:18.650
Really? Where's he been?
Does anyone know where he's been?

21:18.690 --> 21:21.330
Does anyone ever know
where anyone's been?

21:21.380 --> 21:22.710
No.

21:22.720 --> 21:24.980
Come on,Grace,I want
to walk you to class.

Really?

21:45.300 --> 21:46.320
You're over it?

21:46.370 --> 21:47.460
Yeah,I don't care.

21:47.500 --> 21:49.300
You don't care she's
going out with Ricky?

21:49.360 --> 21:51.100
No,I don't.
I feel like such a loser

21:51.150 --> 21:54.070
I even once cared about a girl
that cares about that guy,but--

21:54.790 --> 21:56.860
- No offense.
- None taken.

21:56.900 --> 21:59.420
I'm just gonna stay away
from women for a while.

21:59.450 --> 22:01.380
I'm wanna do something more
productive with my time.

22:01.410 --> 22:03.890
- Like?
- I heard Mr. Molina's back.

22:03.930 --> 22:05.380
Figured I just talk to him.

22:05.420 --> 22:07.110
I want to do some volunteer work.

22:07.150 --> 22:10.230
I want to focus my time on someone
or something other than me.

22:10.270 --> 22:12.110
I want to do something
that matters to someone.

22:12.140 --> 22:16.590
Okay,well,I'm sure you'll get
a lot of satisfaction out of that.

22:32.420 --> 22:34.350
I had a great time Saturday night.

22:38.230 --> 22:40.050
You looked like you were
having a great time.

22:40.080 --> 22:41.660
So did you,did you have sex?

22:41.700 --> 22:43.330
No! Did you have sex?

22:43.370 --> 22:44.630
No.

22:44.680 --> 22:46.350
Ashley is 13.

22:46.370 --> 22:48.450
Yeah? So? She's 43 in Nevada.

22:48.490 --> 22:51.390
She's never had sex in
Nevada or anywhere else.

23:11.040 --> 23:12.540
I didn't even see her yesterday

23:12.560 --> 23:13.900
and I hardly got to talk to her.

I do too.

23:45.040 --> 23:46.600
I can't tell my mom.

23:46.640 --> 23:48.200
She'd just get angry with me.

23:48.240 --> 23:50.010
She's already angry
with my dad right now.

23:50.070 --> 23:51.280
The two of them are fighting.

23:51.300 --> 23:52.980
About him living in the garage?

23:53.030 --> 23:56.920
I don't know. But Ashley
thinks they were havi there.

23:57.550 --> 23:59.450
Well,that could be a good thing.

23:59.500 --> 24:01.040
Maybe they'll get back together.

24:01.070 --> 24:03.520

Hey...

25:47.010 --> 25:48.880
I didn't say anything. Nothing.

25:48.930 --> 25:51.750
I mean,I really wanted this
to work out for Ben and Amy.

25:51.800 --> 25:54.500
Well,yeah,me too,
but someone's in trouble.

25:54.540 --> 25:57.160
Oh,my God,I hope this wasn't a setup.

25:57.210 --> 25:58.230
I don't want to go to jail.

25:58.260 --> 25:59.690
I don't think they'll send us to jail.

25:59.740 --> 26:01.430
We're not in possession
of anything illegal.

26:01.490 --> 26:03.630
I've never seen that
ID before in my life.

26:03.660 --> 26:05.380
So you're gonna lie
if we get caught?

26:05.440 --> 26:06.280
I might.

26:06.320 --> 26:08.000
Yeah,well,I've got
two words for you:

26:08.040 --> 26:09.800
"Martha Stewart."

26:09.850 --> 26:11.410
ID? Give me your ID.

26:12.170 --> 26:13.950
I don't know what you're
doing,but thanks,man.

26:13.990 --> 26:14.550
What's going on?

26:14.610 --> 26:16.500
Quickly,give me your ID. ID,ID.

26:16.550 --> 26:18.440
- Hey,give me your IDs.
- What are you doing?

26:18.470 --> 26:20.230
I don't know,just give me your ID.

26:20.280 --> 26:22.600
There's no sense in all of us
getting in trouble for this.

26:38.220 --> 26:41.100
I don't want to have to make
this a bigger deal than it is.

26:41.120 --> 26:42.760
However,I could arrest you right now

26:42.790 --> 26:45.120
for running a shop
and making illegal IDs

26:45.140 --> 26:47.390
which carries a penalty of up
to six months in jail.

26:47.430 --> 26:48.330
You want to go to jail?

26:48.370 --> 26:50.940
Not really. I've-- I've heard
it's really bad there.

26:54.450 --> 26:56.270
Amy and Ben wanted to get married,

26:56.310 --> 26:58.560
so they needed an ID to prove
that they were old enough,

26:58.590 --> 27:00.584
so I made them one
and everyone else one

27:00.584 --> 27:02.010
who might want to go to the wedding.

27:02.030 --> 27:05.000
And in case we wanted to get
a drink afterwards,but we didn't.

27:05.040 --> 27:09.330
So no one has them.
I have them,or had them.

27:09.360 --> 27:11.880
I-- I cut them up.

27:12.540 --> 27:14.700
an easy way to make some cash

27:14.710 --> 27:16.710
and I didn't think it'dig deal.

27:16.750 --> 27:18.580
But you can'you  anyone else but me.

27:18.590 --> 27:20.430
Me who? Who are you?

27:20.480 --> 27:21.830
I'm Jack Pappas,sir.

27:21.840 --> 27:23.970
You sure you're the one
who made the IDs?

27:24.010 --> 27:25.360
Yeah,I'm responsible for them.

27:25.370 --> 27:27.830
I was the driver.
I drove Ben and Amy to the wedding.

27:27.870 --> 27:30.260
The DA's office would
like a word with you.

27:30.280 --> 27:32.660
- ??your pare
- Yeah,why not?

27:32.680 --> 27:33.910
Can I get some privacy,though?

27:33.930 --> 27:35.680
How's the back seat of a squad car?

27:35.730 --> 27:38.130
Great. I've never seen
the back seat of a squad car.

27:43.850 --> 27:45.070
Why would Jack do that?

27:45.120 --> 27:46.530
Why would he take the blame for you?

27:46.550 --> 27:47.990
I inspire loyalty.

27:48.040 --> 27:49.440
Or you just know way too much.

27:49.460 --> 27:52.710
Or he's just stupid. Or maybe he did it.

27:54.450 --> 27:56.900
Hi. Uh,could we talk?

27:56.910 --> 27:58.260
Oh,yeah. Sure,dude.

27:58.300 --> 28:00.170
I think he's talking to me.

28:00.720 --> 28:01.990
Go.

28:05.950 --> 28:07.180
Hi,there.

28:07.200 --> 28:08.980
Hello. Uh,how are you?

28:09.010 --> 28:10.280
Where have you been?

28:10.300 --> 28:12.090
May I ask what's going on here?

28:12.110 --> 28:14.760
You and Amy tried to get
married with fake IDs?

28:14.770 --> 28:17.620
So,uh,what happened with Jack?

28:17.660 --> 28:20.000
He fally confessed to making
the IDs for you and everyone

28:20.020 --> 28:21.510
who wanted to go to the wedding.

28:21.550 --> 28:23.840
Now he's on his way downtown,as they say.

28:23.860 --> 28:25.330
is surprising.

28:25.360 --> 28:26.740
Yes,it is.

28:26.780 --> 28:28.766
I heard JoeCR

28:28.766 --> 28:32.290
ght it was Sam.

28:32.310 --> 28:34.080
Jack would never make a fake ID.

28:34.130 --> 28:36.690
He wouldn't know how.

28:36.730 --> 28:38.660
Did he make the IDs?

28:38.730 --> 28:41.030
I-- I-- I'd rather not say.

28:41.050 --> 28:45.360
But I hope they let him off
with community service

28:45.400 --> 28:46.670
or a warning,or something.

28:46.700 --> 28:47.790
Yeah,me too,

28:47.820 --> 28:50.660
because making fake IDs is
a very serious offense.

28:50.690 --> 28:52.770
and I'd hate to see him get
jail time because you and Amy

28:52.810 --> 28:55.080
wanted to try to cheat
the system by getting married.

28:55.110 --> 28:56.640
I know it was a bad idea,

28:56.690 --> 29:01.270
but,you know,I love Amy so
I just-- I went along with it.

29:02.950 --> 29:04.690
Well,you didn't have to.

29:10.990 --> 29:12.220
She's right. I-- I didn't have to.

29:12.240 --> 29:15.300
I should have told her that
I thought it was a bad idea.

29:16.330 --> 29:18.220
But I wanted to marry her.

29:18.790 --> 29:20.160
I want her to be my wife.

29:20.200 --> 29:22.240
You're too young to get married.

29:22.270 --> 29:24.210
And her parents don't want
her getting married.

29:24.260 --> 29:26.460
I think that if she's
old enough to have a baby,

29:26.500 --> 29:28.260
she's old enough
to make this decision.

29:28.310 --> 29:30.040
You think it's a good decision?
To get married?

29:30.070 --> 29:31.850
If we had the support of our parents,

29:31.900 --> 29:33.550
I would make that commitment.

29:33.570 --> 29:35.750
A lifelong commitment at 15?

29:36.790 --> 29:38.760
Is that a--?

29:39.360 --> 29:41.180
Did you get married?

29:41.860 --> 29:44.110
Yeah. That's where I was.

31:13.390 --> 31:16.110
You know,if I was their
best friend,who'd be their mother?

31:16.160 --> 31:17.650
I'm definitely their mother.

31:18.850 --> 31:20.450
But we are close.

31:20.500 --> 31:22.490
Ashley,Amy and me.

31:22.750 --> 31:26.020
Would you like the number of
someone you could really talk to?

31:26.070 --> 31:27.110
A therapist.

31:27.140 --> 31:29.010
We have a very nice family therapist

31:29.050 --> 31:30.760
we recommend at times like this.

31:30.790 --> 31:32.540
A therist?

31:32.580 --> 31:33.990
Why would I need a therapist?

31:34.020 --> 31:36.070
If you wanted someone to talk to.

31:36.120 --> 31:37.970
But I talk to my daughters.

31:38.000 --> 31:40.010
I just told you. Ashley and Amy.

31:40.090 --> 31:42.220
We're very close.
We talk about everything.

31:42.240 --> 31:43.840
I don't need a therapist.

31:43.880 --> 31:45.650
Not that I have anything
against therapists,

31:45.670 --> 31:49.410
but I just don't need one. Thanks.

31:53.820 --> 31:55.090
Thanks,Carol.

32:22.610 --> 32:25.040
Um,well,it's nice to finally meet you.

32:25.080 --> 32:27.340
Could there be a more
awkward place for us to meet?

32:27.770 --> 32:29.440
No,I don't think so.

32:29.480 --> 32:31.630

at Elbertson's and
he now has it in his mind

32:44.370 --> 32:46.530
he wants to marry a girl
he's had one date with.

32:46.550 --> 32:48.580
He hardly knows her at all.
He's an adult,but...

32:48.620 --> 32:51.860
I wanted to get some legal
advice before he makes a big mistake.

32:54.720 --> 32:57.300
I'm-- I'm sorry. You--
You're probably here

34:12.000 --> 34:14.070
I think he just did
some digging around.

34:14.090 --> 34:16.810
Hey. It's okay. I wanted to
do something nice for someone.

34:17.570 --> 34:18.159
Joe?

Yeah. He does a lot for everyone

sell fake IDs again

he cares about these fake IDs.

I mean,he prosecutes murder
trials and assault cases and...

34:49.170 --> 34:51.250
Did he ask you anything about Ricky?

No. Why?

I don't know,but I have this gut feeling

34:56.260 --> 34:58.130
it wasn't Joe he was after.

35:53.240 --> 35:55.570
Yeah. Good for you.

35:55.990 --> 35:58.640
But I'd rather be
the one you cheat with

35:58.680 --> 36:01.240
than the one you cheat on.

36:01.290 --> 36:04.500
I like our relationship just fine.

36:04.540 --> 36:07.170
Yeah. Me too.

36:07.190 --> 36:09.080
Just out of curiosity,

36:09.670 --> 36:11.730
have you ever been
arrested for anything?

36:11.750 --> 36:13.310
No.

36:20.660 --> 36:22.580
There aren't that
many places that hire,uh,

36:22.600 --> 36:24.850
teenagers with or without work permits.

36:24.900 --> 36:27.020
Yeah,well,my research isn't that great.

36:27.040 --> 36:31.730
Uh,maybe Mr. Molina can help
us tomorrow if his wife lets him.

36:33.060 --> 36:35.250
Oh,she's the jealous type.

36:35.270 --> 36:39.150
Mr. Molina went out with another
woman and while he was at her house,

36:39.200 --> 36:44.160
his girlfriend,and now wife,
broke down the door.

36:44.180 --> 36:44.560
Yeah.

36:44.610 --> 36:46.440
And now he's married
to the door-breaker.

36:46.460 --> 36:49.750
Well,I promise to never
break down your door.

36:49.780 --> 36:51.660

37:04.950 --> 37:06.150
And it's not.

37:06.170 --> 37:08.710
It's clearly not. So...

37:09.900 --> 37:11.520
...I can't marry you,Amy.

37:11.580 --> 37:14.660
But we're gonna have to figure
out what this non-married,

37:14.670 --> 37:18.790
unmarried,want-to-be-marrd
relationship is.

37:18.830 --> 37:21.670

It's gonna be fine.

I asked you. I'm just looking
for a job,remember?

37:38.620 --> 37:40.480

37:42.910 --> 37:44.990

out around the house.

37:46.920 --> 37:49.130

37:49.150 --> 37:52.490

I'm very good at ironing.

Ben about the wedding.

ouo overjob firsjo

38:14.070 --> 38:16.570
It might. It might not.

38:16.620 --> 38:19.100
So about the wedding.

38:19.930 --> 38:21.230
I take full responsibility.

38:21.280 --> 38:23.310
No,I take full responsibility.

38:23.320 --> 38:24.650
You're both responsible.

38:24.700 --> 38:26.850
And so is the guy at
Elbertson's who married you.

38:26.880 --> 38:29.620
He knew that you were underage.
He knew that they were fake IDs.

38:29.660 --> 38:31.470
He just felt sorry for you,Amy.

38:31.510 --> 38:33.180
And you,Ben.

38:33.220 --> 38:34.800
Oh.

38:34.830 --> 38:37.270
I kind of thought so,
but I really didn't care.

38:37.310 --> 38:38.890
I just wanted to get married.

38:38.910 --> 38:40.650
You can't run away awhis,Amy.

38:40.690 --> 38:42.320
It's not possible.

38:42.350 --> 38:44.040
She can run to our house,

38:44.090 --> 38:45.130
if you'd let her..

38:45.150 --> 38:46.580
I'm not gonna let her.

38:46.620 --> 38:48.880
But Mom,I can't find a job.

38:48.900 --> 38:51.830
And I don't know anything about
having a baby or raising a child.

38:51.880 --> 38:55.190
And I can't go to school and
go to work and be a mother.

38:55.210 --> 38:56.300
But you can run over here

38:56.320 --> 38:58.550
and have someone else raise your
child so you can go to school

38:58.580 --> 39:00.660
and then be a mother
when it's convenient?

39:00.630 --> 39:03.610
Well,we weren't quite
thinking about it like that.

39:03.630 --> 39:05.380
We weren't thinking. Period.

39:05.420 --> 39:07.480
It's just that...

39:07.515 --> 39:08.500
I love her.

39:08.550 --> 39:09.550
I know you do,Ben.

39:09.580 --> 39:11.350
And so do I.

39:11.780 --> 39:13.630

And that's what
I'm doing right now,Amy.

39:30.560 --> 39:33.480
I'm coming here to try
to make you to realize

39:33.500 --> 39:38.650
the awesome responsibility of taking
care of a baby and raising a child.

39:42.410 --> 39:45.410
Did you really think getting
married would solve anything?

39:45.420 --> 39:47.680
Kind of. Yeah.

39:47.730 --> 39:49.670
I thought that if I just lived here,

39:49.700 --> 39:52.400
then somebody could watch
the baby while I went to school.

39:52.460 --> 39:55.010
That would be better than
daycare,wouldn't it?

39:55.040 --> 39:56.660
Someone like?

39:56.710 --> 39:57.740
Housekeeper?

39:57.790 --> 39:59.420
Yeah,or we could get a nanny.

39:59.470 --> 40:01.520
And have your dad pay for that?

40:01.530 --> 40:02.770
Well...

40:02.810 --> 40:05.210
Ricky should help.
He's the father.

40:05.245 --> 40:07.590
I don't know if he
could or if he would,

40:07.640 --> 40:11.950
and I-- I don't know
if we want him to be involved.

40:11.970 --> 40:13.160
Oh,he's involved.

40:13.220 --> 40:16.770
He said he wants to be
involved,and legally,he is,Amy.

40:16.790 --> 40:18.010
Ben.

40:18.060 --> 40:20.880
But Mom,can't we keep him
from being involved somehow?

40:20.910 --> 40:22.460
No. I don't thinkat we can.

40:22.500 --> 40:24.570
I mean,he has said that
he wants to be involved.

40:24.600 --> 40:26.060
He's made that pretty clear.

40:26.095 --> 40:27.560
We jusn't know howkn.

Look,I'm on your side here,Amy.
I am on your side.

40:40.050 --> 40:42.640
I am not being mean by trying
to get you face reality.

40:42.680 --> 40:44.960
But a baby is coming.

40:44.990 --> 40:47.420
And it's not just enough
to have a plan.

40:47.470 --> 40:49.630
You have to act on that plan.

40:49.660 --> 40:52.080
So,what is your plan,Amy?

40:52.120 --> 40:54.170
Ben?

40:54.180 --> 40:55.500
Look,I want to help you.

40:55.540 --> 40:58.640
But I can't help you
if you don't talk to me.

40:58.670 --> 41:01.340
And there are no easy answers.

41:01.800 --> 41:02.850
You ei a job,

41:02.900 --> 41:05.320
go to school and get someone
to help with child care,

41:05.370 --> 41:08.640
or you think seriously
about adoption.

41:09.290 --> 41:10.630
But whatever choice you make,

41:10.650 --> 41:12.770
it has to be what is right
for your child,Amy,

41:12.790 --> 41:15.490
not just about
what is easiest for you.

41:15.540 --> 41:17.200
You can't run away from this.

41:17.220 --> 41:18.260
You have to face the fact

41:18.310 --> 41:20.430
that you are halfway
through your pregnancy.

41:20.460 --> 41:23.110
And the baby's gonna
be here before you know it.

41:26.390 --> 41:28.640
Mom?

41:29.850 --> 41:31.400
I think the baby agrees with you.

41:31.440 --> 41:33.710
I think it might be coming right now.
