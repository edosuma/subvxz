WE'RE NOT FUCKING.

31:02.653 --> 31:04.363
I MEAN, NO.
WE'RE USUALLY FUCKING.

31:04.363 --> 31:05.990
BUT DURING THE BRIEF WINDOWS
OF TIME

31:05.990 --> 31:08.117
WHEN WE'RE DOING
OTHER THINGS BESIDES FUCKING,

31:08.117 --> 31:09.952
LIKE EATING PANCAKES
WITH OUR HANDS--

31:09.952 --> 31:13.580
- YOU WANT TO GET MARRIED?

31:13.580 --> 31:14.916
- WHAT?

31:14.916 --> 31:16.208
- I MEAN, MY FOLKS
MET ON A TUESDAY

31:16.208 --> 31:18.836
AND MARRIED TWO DAYS LATER.
- NO SHIT?

31:18.836 --> 31:21.505
- NO. MY DAD--HE WAS
SHIPPING OFF FOR VIETNAM--

31:21.505 --> 31:22.881
ASKED HER.
SHE SAID YES.

31:22.881 --> 31:24.591
- ARE THEY STILL TOGETHER?

31:24.591 --> 31:27.970
- YEAH.

31:27.970 --> 31:29.931
- I'D MARRY YOU.
- OH, WOULD YOU?

31:29.931 --> 31:31.473
- WHY? IS THERE A REASON
I SHOULDN'T?

31:31.473 --> 31:33.267
- NO. I'M A GOOD CHOICE.
- I'M A GREAT CHOICE.

31:33.267 --> 31:34.601
- WELL, IF IT WERE UP TO ME,
I'D DO IT TODAY.

31:34.601 --> 31:36.520

31:36.520 --> 31:39.732
ALL RIGHT.

31:39.732 --> 31:42.026

31:49.158 --> 31:50.952

TILL AFTER WE'RE MARRIED?

31:50.952 --> 31:52.870

ALL RIGHT.

32:07.009 --> 32:09.803

32:09.803 --> 32:11.638

32:12.848 --> 32:15.017
FINGERS TOGETHER.

32:15.017 --> 32:17.853
SO AS YOU THROW THE HOOK,
YOU'RE GONNA ROTATE YOUR BODY

32:17.853 --> 32:19.855

33:00.146 --> 33:02.773
WHO'S APPLICANT A?

33:02.773 --> 33:04.066
- THAT WOULD BE ME.

33:04.066 --> 33:06.318
- AM I RELATED TO YOU?

33:06.318 --> 33:09.988
I LOVE THAT THEY
HAVE TO ASK THAT.

33:09.988 --> 33:13.076
- UH, YOU'RE NOT GONNA
TAKE MY LAST NAME, ARE YOU?

33:13.076 --> 33:14.743
I'M--I'M--I MEAN,
I'M COOL EITHER WAY, BUT--

33:14.743 --> 33:16.578

WHY NOT?

33:18.122 --> 33:20.165
FIONA FENDER.

33:20.165 --> 33:22.709

33:24.461 --> 33:27.131
IN FRONT OF THE F.
SEE?

33:27.131 --> 33:29.091
IT'S SILENT.
NOBODY EVER READS IT RIGHT.

33:29.091 --> 33:30.759
ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU DON'T HAVE TO TAKE MY NAME.

33:30.759 --> 33:32.136
- NO, NO, NO.
I WANT TO.

33:32.136 --> 33:33.637
I WANT TO.

FIONA P-FENDER.

33:35.722 --> 33:36.932

AND I CAN LOSE THIS P-JOB.
[laughs]

33:49.153 --> 33:51.155
- WELL, IF WE ARE GOING
TO SQUEEZE A WEDDING IN,

33:51.155 --> 33:52.198

SO IF YOU AND YOUR BOY

34:37.075 --> 34:38.619
WANT TO DO SOME--
- OKAY.

34:38.619 --> 34:41.205
TELL ME EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED
WHEN YOU LAST SAW ME.

34:41.205 --> 34:43.207

34:44.708 --> 34:47.628
[cheering]

34:47.628 --> 34:50.297

YOU MET DOWNSTAIRS IN TOWN

34:50.297 --> 34:51.715
FOR THE CONVENTION.

34:56.512 --> 35:00.224
AND A GUY THAT WORKS OUT FRONT
AT THE HOT DOGS.

35:02.893 --> 35:06.063
AND A BUSINESSMAN

35:07.856 --> 35:10.901
YOU AND HIM LEFT TOGETHER.

35:10.901 --> 35:12.819

35:46.979 --> 35:49.565
IT WAS THE BEST INVESTMENT
YOU COULD MAKE.

35:49.565 --> 35:51.942

I NEVER DOUBTED IT.

35:51.942 --> 35:53.652
TELL ME,

36:06.832 --> 36:09.126
- ENGINEERING.

36:09.126 --> 36:11.044
- WELL,
YOU DIDN'T SEE THAT COMING.

36:11.044 --> 36:13.171
- OR MICROROBOTICS. YOU KNOW,
I HAVEN'T MADE UP MY MIND YET.

36:13.171 --> 36:14.464
- DAD'S AN ENGINEER.
HE INVENTED

36:14.464 --> 36:16.259
A LINE
OF WATER-FREE URINALS.

36:16.259 --> 36:18.386
- OH, REALLY?
- I DIDN'T INVENT THE URINALS.

36:18.386 --> 36:21.263
I, UH, WORKED ON THE SEALING
CARTRIDGE AND GASKET.

36:21.263 --> 36:22.973
THERE'S A LOT OF MONEY
IN URINE.

36:22.973 --> 36:25.892
IT NEVER GOES OUT OF FASHION.
- NICE.

36:25.892 --> 36:28.520

36:30.647 --> 36:33.359
FOR A BIODEGRADABLE ALTERNATIVE

36:33.359 --> 36:35.694
- OH. WHAT'S IT MADE OF?
- IT'S A TYPE OF FUNGI.

36:35.694 --> 36:37.405
- SMELLS LIKE MUSHROOMS.
- YOU TAKE

36:37.405 --> 36:39.531
ANY SUBSTRATE
OF INDUSTRIAL WASTE, LIKE--

36:39.531 --> 36:40.907
LIKE, UH,
CHOPPED-UP CORNSTALKS.

36:40.907 --> 36:44.077
AND YOU INJECT IT
WITH MYSELIUM,

36:44.077 --> 36:46.204
AND--SEE?
IT'S NOT VERY INTERESTING.

36:46.204 --> 36:48.249
- SO YOU JUST--
YOU POUR IT AROUND THE OBJECT

36:48.249 --> 36:49.416
THAT YOU'RE PACKING
AND THEN IT HARDENS?

36:49.416 --> 36:51.418
- THAT'S RIGHT.

36:51.418 --> 36:53.587
BECOMES A MOLD
OF THE OBJECT.

36:53.587 --> 36:54.921
YOU KNOW, IF YOU WANT,

36:54.921 --> 36:57.799
I WILL SHOW YOU

36:57.799 --> 37:00.552
- SURE.
YEAH.

37:00.552 --> 37:03.347
[low background chatter]

37:03.347 --> 37:05.057
- I JUST, UH--
I JUST REALIZED THAT WE

37:05.057 --> 37:07.059
DON'T HAVE ANY WEDDING RINGS.
- THAT'S OKAY.

37:08.685 --> 37:10.228
- YEAH, I HAVE MY GRANDMA'S
ENGAGEMENT RING,

37:10.228 --> 37:11.772
BUT IT'S AT MY MOM'S HOUSE.

37:11.772 --> 37:16.234
DON'T WE NEED SOMETHING
FOR THE CEREMONY?

37:16.234 --> 37:17.319
OH, WAIT.

37:17.319 --> 37:19.322
FLOWERS.

37:22.949 --> 37:24.993
- 10 BUCKS FOR THOSE?
TRY 2.

37:26.787 --> 37:30.207
OH, LOOK.

THERE'S OUR WEDDING RINGS.

37:31.792 --> 37:33.293
I CAN MAKE A LITTLE CORSAGE.

37:33.293 --> 37:35.379
PUT A FLOWER
IN YOUR BUTTONHOLE.

37:35.379 --> 37:37.255
OH.
YOU DON'T HAVE A BUTTONHOLE.

37:37.255 --> 37:40.509
- I'LL JUST UNZIP MY FLY.

37:40.509 --> 37:42.386
- THIS IS STUPID, RIGHT?

37:42.386 --> 37:44.221
- RIGHT.

37:44.221 --> 37:46.349
- UNLESS IT'S NOT.

37:46.349 --> 37:48.600
- RIGHT?

37:48.600 --> 37:49.810
- I GOT TO BE AT WORK
IN AN HOUR.

37:49.810 --> 37:51.269
SHOULD WE JUST GO?

37:51.269 --> 37:52.562
- OKAY.

37:52.562 --> 37:54.564
- UNLESS WE SHOULDN'T.

37:54.564 --> 37:57.693
- GUS PFENDER
AND FIONA GALLAGHER.

38:05.451 --> 38:08.412
- PUT THAT SOMEPLACE SAFE.

38:08.412 --> 38:10.622
- ARE YOU GOOD WITH FRACTIONS?
- FRACTIONS OF WHAT?

38:10.622 --> 38:12.833
- LIKE IF YOU HAVE A 16th
OF AN OUNCE OF SOMETHING,

38:12.833 --> 38:15.043
HOW MANY GRAMS
WOULD THAT BE?

38:15.043 --> 38:17.170
- YOU DEALING DRUGS?
- NO.

38:17.170 --> 38:18.714
- IF FIONA FOUND
OUT I WAS HELPING YOU

38:18.714 --> 38:20.424
WITH YOUR DRUG FRACTIONS,
SHE'D HAVE MY SCALP.

38:20.424 --> 38:22.050
- NO ONE'S TELLING
FIONA ANYTHING.

38:22.050 --> 38:24.387
- BASIC OVERVIEW.
YOU GOT FLAPS,

38:24.387 --> 38:27.639
HALF G'S, G'S, TEENERS,
8 BALLS, AND OUNCES.

38:27.639 --> 38:31.309
AN OUNCE IS 28 GRAMS,
BUT REALLY IT'S 28.35.

38:31.309 --> 38:34.771
AN 8-BALL IS 3.54,
AND A TEENER IS 1.77.

38:34.771 --> 38:36.648
BUT THE DEALERS ROUND DOWN.

38:36.648 --> 38:39.609
SO THEY POCKET THE EXTRA 0.35.
YOU FOLLOWING?

38:39.609 --> 38:42.112

I'M BUDDY DIAMOND.

40:17.541 --> 40:19.167
I FOUNDED THIS ORGANIZATION.
