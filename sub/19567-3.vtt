00:00.031 --> 00:01.697
Previously on "The Arrangement"...

00:01.698 --> 00:03.366
- Megan Morrison.
- I don't know who this is.

00:03.368 --> 00:04.531
She hasn't broken out yet.

00:04.556 --> 00:06.256
Ah, right. Well, you are the producer.

00:06.281 --> 00:08.548
I'm just the guy looking out for
the Institute and Kyle's needs.

00:08.573 --> 00:10.973
- You've only got two hours.
- Until what?

00:10.975 --> 00:13.209
Until you read with Kyle West.

00:13.211 --> 00:16.212
I'm going to Oslo. It's
the only way to stop this.

00:16.213 --> 00:19.182
What makes you think
that you can stop it?

00:19.184 --> 00:20.660
That was amazing.

00:20.685 --> 00:22.611
You are amazing.

00:22.636 --> 00:24.379
The whole world wants
to work with Kyle West.

00:24.404 --> 00:25.655
He can do whatever he wants.

00:25.657 --> 00:27.423
He's into the whole self-actualizing

00:27.425 --> 00:29.358
Institute of the Higher Mind stuff.

00:29.360 --> 00:31.794
That's what makes him cult-y and weird.

00:31.796 --> 00:33.429
I don't want to go back to reality,

00:33.431 --> 00:34.931
and I won't do it quietly.

00:34.933 --> 00:37.500
He's offering you a contract marriage.

00:37.502 --> 00:39.972
If you sign this, you
are going to be able to do

00:39.997 --> 00:41.484
whatever you want.

00:43.000 --> 00:49.074

00:55.090 --> 00:57.274
So tell me about you. What do you do?

00:57.276 --> 00:59.677
- I am a corporate lawyer.
- Get out.

00:59.679 --> 01:01.445
- Yes, I am.
- Wow.

01:01.470 --> 01:03.057
- Hey, Terence.
- I know, I'm more into systems really.

01:03.082 --> 01:04.581
I made the call. The deal's closed.

01:04.584 --> 01:06.083
Like, the way they
function, how they work.

01:06.085 --> 01:07.952
- Oh, yeah, closer.
- What they reflect about us.

01:07.954 --> 01:10.521
So corporate law is
basically like a window

01:10.523 --> 01:12.401
into a calm state...

01:13.495 --> 01:14.915
Mind if I get your picture?

01:14.940 --> 01:16.160
Wonderful.

01:16.162 --> 01:18.262
It's Kyle. It's Kyle West!

01:18.264 --> 01:19.865
He looks so much cuter in person.

01:19.890 --> 01:22.126
I'm definitely a feminist,

01:22.151 --> 01:25.149
but as an actress trying to
get inside of the character,

01:25.174 --> 01:29.321
you have to recognize that
feminism isn't just one thing.

01:29.346 --> 01:31.321
- Right?
- In other words, you're smart.

01:31.346 --> 01:32.641
Oh.

01:32.666 --> 01:34.812
You want to know how somebody
like me wins an Oscar?

01:34.814 --> 01:37.581
- Brilliance.
- No, I'm not brilliant, sweetie.

01:37.583 --> 01:41.089
I produce movies with smart
women about smart women.

01:41.114 --> 01:42.947
Pardon me, Russell. It's time.

01:42.949 --> 01:44.849
- Ooh, thank you.
- Cheers.

01:48.888 --> 01:51.989
Ladies and gentlemen, Kyle
West and Megan Morrison.

01:53.693 --> 01:55.306
Look at this.

01:56.996 --> 01:58.821
This is crazy.

01:58.876 --> 02:00.475
Megan and I are excited you're all here

02:00.477 --> 02:02.110
for the third annual fund-raiser

02:02.135 --> 02:03.985
for the Change of Clothes Foundation.

02:05.201 --> 02:06.716
Now, all the money that we raise today

02:06.741 --> 02:09.229
will go towards realizing
the vision of fashion...

02:09.253 --> 02:11.554
as an instrument of change.

02:11.556 --> 02:13.823
Which means backing
up-and-coming designers

02:13.825 --> 02:15.925
who have pledged to abide
by strict environmental

02:15.927 --> 02:18.461
and social values as
they create their lines.

02:18.463 --> 02:21.683
We have one of these very
talented designers with us tonight,

02:21.708 --> 02:23.266
Maxwell Davis,

02:23.268 --> 02:25.201
who designed the dress
I'm very fortunate

02:25.203 --> 02:27.003
to be wearing right now.

02:27.005 --> 02:28.497
Thank you.

02:28.499 --> 02:29.649
Thank you all for coming.

02:29.674 --> 02:33.190
Please enjoy yourselves and,
uh, keep those checks coming.

02:34.538 --> 02:36.379
- Way to go.
- Megan...

02:36.381 --> 02:38.292
- I need to speak with you.
- Now?

02:38.317 --> 02:39.887
Yeah, now.

02:40.819 --> 02:42.785
Okay.

02:42.787 --> 02:44.454
That's you, right?

02:44.456 --> 02:47.323
- Oh, my God.
- What's going on?

03:01.783 --> 03:03.583
_

03:03.608 --> 03:05.942
Sweetie, your deal is going to close.

03:05.944 --> 03:07.543
I'm just gonna make the studio drop

03:07.545 --> 03:09.779
some of their offensive
ticky-tack bullshit,

03:09.781 --> 03:11.614
- then we'll be done.
- Awesome.

03:11.616 --> 03:14.017
But if the ticky-tack
bullshit is a sticking point,

03:14.019 --> 03:15.885
I mean, I-I just want to do the film.

03:15.887 --> 03:17.920
And you're going to do the film.

03:17.922 --> 03:20.374
I'm just gonna do my goddamn job first.

03:20.399 --> 03:22.413
Okay, go have fun at this party.

03:22.438 --> 03:24.014
Make everyone fall in love with you.

03:24.039 --> 03:26.306
- All right. Bye.
- And we'll talk later.

03:26.702 --> 03:28.965
This has been going on for, like, days.

03:28.967 --> 03:30.600
Do they always draw it out like this?

03:30.602 --> 03:32.402
I don't know. I need a drink.

03:32.404 --> 03:34.504
No, what you need to do...

03:34.506 --> 03:37.907
is embrace the fact that you are awesome

03:37.909 --> 03:40.343
and everyone in the whole
world finally knows who you are.

03:40.345 --> 03:43.935
All they really know is that
I'm Kyle West's girlfriend.

03:44.590 --> 03:45.881
Wait.

03:45.906 --> 03:49.315
What if that's all that I am?

03:51.122 --> 03:52.873
- I will pound you with this.
- Be careful.

03:54.547 --> 03:56.430
- Oh, my God.
- There's so many people.

03:56.461 --> 03:58.169
Oh, my God.

04:01.522 --> 04:03.630
Uh, yeah, I'll let him
know. All right, thanks.

04:03.810 --> 04:05.449
It's a little bottle-necked at the gate.

04:05.474 --> 04:06.680
Megan will be a few minutes.

04:06.705 --> 04:08.337
- Hey, you got a mint?
- Yeah.

04:08.339 --> 04:10.287
Thank you.

04:11.276 --> 04:13.042
Nice recast on the assistant.

04:13.044 --> 04:15.378
- Is he working out so far?
- So far.

04:15.380 --> 04:17.113
So I'm introducing Megan to...

04:17.115 --> 04:19.547
Adam, Linda. Anybody else?

04:19.572 --> 04:20.738
Russell.

04:21.084 --> 04:23.591
Dirty Uncle Russell? Really?

04:25.498 --> 04:28.758
- He'll promise her an Oscar.
- Promised me an Oscar.

04:28.760 --> 04:31.076
So I finally got my own show.

04:31.101 --> 04:33.941
I was 42... exactly like my dad.

04:33.966 --> 04:36.378
I mean, I was a real
slave to that narrative.

04:36.403 --> 04:38.434
And then I took the first seminar...

04:38.436 --> 04:41.671
Demystifying Happiness... and
it changed the game totally.

04:41.673 --> 04:44.151
It... it blew my mind.

04:44.612 --> 04:46.576
Well, I think it's great
that your so connected

04:46.578 --> 04:48.041
to what got you here.

04:49.991 --> 04:52.920
- Now go discover where you're going.
- Hmm.

04:52.945 --> 04:55.184
- Hello, darling.
- Hello.

04:55.186 --> 04:56.986
That's why I hate
parties. I'm going home.

04:56.988 --> 04:58.287
No, you are not.

04:58.289 --> 04:59.756
Hey, Megan.

04:59.758 --> 05:02.258
- Quick picture, please?
- God.

05:02.709 --> 05:04.927
- Oh, more.
- Beautiful.

05:04.929 --> 05:07.063
- Oh, should we do...
- Oh, yeah.

05:07.065 --> 05:09.165
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

05:09.167 --> 05:11.667
- Love your shoes.
- Thank you.

05:15.234 --> 05:18.436
Now, that is a fierce-looking crew.

05:19.170 --> 05:21.711
Kyle, these are my
friends Hope and Shaun.

05:21.713 --> 05:24.391
- It's so nice to finally meet...
- I'm going on for hugs.

05:24.416 --> 05:26.017
- Oh. Okay.
- Get over here.

05:26.042 --> 05:27.587
I've heard so much about you both.

05:27.612 --> 05:29.185
- Hi.
- How you doing?

05:29.187 --> 05:32.046
Oh, your house is so gorgeous.

05:32.071 --> 05:33.204
Thank you, thank you.

05:33.229 --> 05:35.935
Megan actually says you have
a mid-century post and beam.

05:35.960 --> 05:37.446
I love that.

05:37.962 --> 05:40.096
And you... I saw your
episode of "Underage."

05:40.098 --> 05:42.832
- You were hilarious.
- Yeah, that's...

05:42.834 --> 05:43.992
I, um...

05:45.077 --> 05:47.202
He prepared.

05:47.483 --> 05:49.672
You're damn right I
prepared. Come on, let's go.

05:49.674 --> 05:51.474
Welcome.

05:51.476 --> 05:53.910
You know, we should actually
put her on Andres's radar.

05:53.912 --> 05:56.483
Oh, my God, it's so nice in here.

05:56.508 --> 05:57.983
You're gonna love him.

05:58.008 --> 06:00.293
He's not as depressed
as he looks, I promise.

06:00.318 --> 06:02.251
Oh, okay. Well, who's Andreas?

06:02.276 --> 06:03.898
Is, like, a Institute of the
Higher Mind shaman or something?

06:03.923 --> 06:06.422
No. Andres Plang, he's the
director of "The Kill Plan."

06:06.424 --> 06:07.828
Oh, Jesus.

06:07.853 --> 06:09.224
Did you put Kyle up to this?

06:09.249 --> 06:11.294
No, he just thought about it right now.

06:11.296 --> 06:14.263
- Don't be nervous.
- I'm not nervous. Just...

06:14.265 --> 06:17.800
you know, the whole "who you
know" thing is so obvious.

06:17.802 --> 06:20.937
All right. Never mind, then.
I'll introduce you to Terrence.

06:20.939 --> 06:23.005
He's already a big fan
of your Instagram page.

06:23.030 --> 06:24.499
Oh, I'll say hi to Terrence, yeah.

06:24.524 --> 06:26.223
No, I'll kick him in the nuts for you.

06:26.248 --> 06:28.535
It's 50/50 he wears some
sort of protective device.

06:28.560 --> 06:30.360
Look, how many shifts
did you cover for me

06:30.385 --> 06:32.168
when I had an audition, huh?

06:32.193 --> 06:33.560
Let me pay you back.

06:33.585 --> 06:35.808
Andres can help you.

06:35.887 --> 06:37.987
- Andres.
- Megan.

06:37.989 --> 06:40.423
- You look so dapper.
- And you look stunning.

06:40.425 --> 06:43.192
Oh, thank you.

06:43.194 --> 06:46.295
This is my very good friend Hope Declan.

06:46.297 --> 06:48.401
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi.

06:48.426 --> 06:50.499
Are you waiting for somebody?

06:50.501 --> 06:52.635
Oh, no.

06:52.637 --> 06:55.504
Just, um, trying to
figure this party out.

06:57.177 --> 06:58.644
So is everybody here

06:58.669 --> 07:00.443
with the Institute of the Higher Mind?

07:00.445 --> 07:02.712
'Cause if people are gonna
start handing out pamphlets...

07:02.714 --> 07:05.909
Oh, pamphlets. That's
what I forgot at home.

07:06.292 --> 07:09.051
And you're with the Institute.

07:10.082 --> 07:12.291
I teach the introductory
workshop. But don't worry...

07:12.316 --> 07:14.322
- I didn't come over here to recruit.
- Wow.

07:14.347 --> 07:16.110
Oh, so you have good intentions?

07:16.135 --> 07:18.671
Oh, well, I didn't say that.

07:20.431 --> 07:22.947
- Oh.
- I'm James.

07:23.268 --> 07:25.468
- Adam.
- We need to talk.

07:25.470 --> 07:27.003
Ugh, just don't tell me the story

07:27.005 --> 07:28.555
of your personal transformation, okay?

07:28.580 --> 07:31.040
I'm losing my shit. Does that count?

07:31.042 --> 07:33.156
Kyle's new friend...

07:33.648 --> 07:35.953
Okay, let's talk.

07:36.247 --> 07:38.014
I had her deal on my desk for three days

07:38.016 --> 07:40.717
waiting for my approval, but
I haven't even touched it.

07:40.742 --> 07:42.952
I know Kyle and Andres
say she's brilliant.

07:42.954 --> 07:44.353
And the head of the studio said

07:44.355 --> 07:45.988
they could cast whoever they want.

07:45.990 --> 07:47.734
I know what I said, but...

07:47.759 --> 07:50.092
at the end of the day, I
have a franchise to launch,

07:50.094 --> 07:52.104
and nobody knows who this girl is.

07:52.129 --> 07:53.462
So now you want to reject the deal

07:53.464 --> 07:55.398
that you've already
agreed to in principle?

07:55.400 --> 07:57.533
Yes, I want to be that asshole.

07:57.535 --> 07:59.468
Look, wouldn't you feel more comfortable

07:59.470 --> 08:01.522
with a recognizable name?

08:02.407 --> 08:04.206
I'm not your problem, Adam.

08:04.208 --> 08:07.276
I know, but maybe you can
talk to my problem for me.

08:11.115 --> 08:13.850
I'm not dropping that grenade
tonight, and neither are you.

08:13.875 --> 08:16.117
It stays between us for now.

08:16.220 --> 08:17.520
Oh.

08:17.522 --> 08:20.086
You boys talking business without me?

08:20.477 --> 08:22.656
- I have a situation.
- No.

08:25.029 --> 08:28.256
Well, when "Underage" ended,
I just sort of felt like I...

08:28.281 --> 08:30.039
you know, I'd kind of
done everything, you know,

08:30.064 --> 08:33.311
which is the goal for a while...
just, you know, keep working.

08:33.336 --> 08:35.104
Don't ask questions.

08:35.106 --> 08:37.006
I just sort of feel
like now I need to be

08:37.030 --> 08:39.785
a little more selective with my roles.

08:39.811 --> 08:41.610
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

08:41.611 --> 08:43.592
I feel like... maybe it's
like dating, you know?

08:43.616 --> 08:46.315
It's, um... just kind of hooking
up with everybody, and it's awesome,

08:46.317 --> 08:48.451
and then one day you
wake up, and you realize,

08:48.453 --> 08:51.530
"Maybe I should really
be looking for Mr. Right."

08:51.555 --> 08:53.813
So that's kind of where I'm
at. I'm looking for my... my...

08:53.815 --> 08:55.568
my Mr. Right project.

08:55.593 --> 08:57.561
I wish you luck with that.

08:57.586 --> 08:58.594
- Thank you.
- Just excuse me.

08:58.619 --> 08:59.688
- Uh, Russell.
- Yeah, no worries.

08:59.713 --> 09:00.742
- Andres.
- Yeah.

09:00.767 --> 09:03.727
- Come meet a friend with me.
- No more actresses, please.

09:10.767 --> 09:13.175
- Hope, are you okay?
- Yeah. No, I'm great.

09:13.177 --> 09:15.544
Um, scotch. What do you have?

09:18.344 --> 09:19.749
You're doing amazing.

09:19.751 --> 09:21.450
Oh, hold on. There's one more
person I want you to meet.

09:21.452 --> 09:22.852
Wait, wait, wait. Stop, stop.

09:22.854 --> 09:25.219
Can I just stop and tell you

09:25.244 --> 09:27.375
how wonderful you are?

09:27.400 --> 09:29.759
- No, you may not.
- I'm serious.

09:29.761 --> 09:34.096
The way you've set all this
up and welcomed my friends

09:34.098 --> 09:36.599
and just everything about this night...

09:36.601 --> 09:39.104
I'm really grateful for it all.

09:39.471 --> 09:41.470
I'm really grateful for you.

09:45.410 --> 09:47.176
Kyle? Can I talk to you outside?

09:47.178 --> 09:48.861
Hold on. One second.

09:50.081 --> 09:51.714
What is it?

09:53.184 --> 09:55.939
Miss Morrison.

09:56.033 --> 09:57.566
Ah.

09:57.854 --> 10:00.143
What up, party people?

10:00.168 --> 10:01.957
- Hey.
- Hey.

10:03.761 --> 10:05.394
Oh, how did it go with Andres?

10:05.396 --> 10:07.663
Oh, great, yeah. No,
he totally loves me.

10:07.665 --> 10:10.789
Um, I'm just not really sure
if he's my kind of director.

10:11.838 --> 10:13.012
- Megan.
- Yeah?

10:13.037 --> 10:15.546
- This is James.
- Oh.

10:15.571 --> 10:18.274
- Hello, James.
- Hello.

10:18.276 --> 10:21.010
Nice to meet the person everyone
wants a glimpse of tonight.

10:21.012 --> 10:22.569
Oh, stop.

10:22.594 --> 10:24.781
No, don't act like you don't know.

10:24.783 --> 10:26.993
This is your moment, girl.

10:27.018 --> 10:29.553
- This is happening.
- Hello.

10:29.578 --> 10:31.253
- Yes.
- Give me this.

10:31.255 --> 10:32.477
Take it.

10:32.502 --> 10:34.571
A-and everyone loves
Megan at the studio.

10:34.659 --> 10:36.555
Don't get us wrong, but
if we had another name

10:36.580 --> 10:38.071
on the poster with you,

10:38.096 --> 10:40.149
we're talking "Iron Man" territory...

10:40.174 --> 10:42.853
three huge films over
five to eight years

10:42.878 --> 10:44.811
and significantly less pressure on you,

10:44.836 --> 10:46.702
which is never a bad thing.

10:48.706 --> 10:51.474
- What do you think?
- Terrence?

10:55.525 --> 10:57.319
It's hard not to see the upside.

10:57.344 --> 10:59.953
Again, we can't wait to work with Megan.

10:59.978 --> 11:02.384
I-it's just about
finding the right project.

11:03.430 --> 11:05.555
Yeah. No, I-I hear you.

11:06.234 --> 11:08.891
Yeah, well, I want to make
sure that you both hear me.

11:10.928 --> 11:12.828
I'm the upside.

11:12.853 --> 11:16.109
I put the asses in the seats
no matter who's on the poster.

11:16.134 --> 11:18.567
And this is the right project for Megan,

11:18.592 --> 11:22.163
so you better close the deal
and put her in the movie... now,

11:22.188 --> 11:24.162
'cause I promise you, if you don't...

11:26.878 --> 11:29.093
there isn't gonna be a movie.

11:30.274 --> 11:31.982
Enjoy the party.

11:39.569 --> 11:41.217
_

11:43.052 --> 11:45.436
_

11:46.557 --> 11:48.393
- Hi.
- Hi.

11:50.805 --> 11:52.053
- Kyle.
- Yeah, man.

11:52.055 --> 11:54.022
- Yeah, it looked great.
- Excuse me.

11:54.047 --> 11:55.622
My deal just closed.

11:55.624 --> 11:57.788
- What?
- Yes.

11:59.946 --> 12:01.452
It would've been nice
to have your support

12:01.477 --> 12:03.064
when Kyle drew his line in the sand.

12:03.066 --> 12:04.732
I didn't agree with your take on it.

12:05.100 --> 12:08.130
Besides, Adam should've
come to me. I'm the producer.

12:08.155 --> 12:09.771
I really don't think he
makes the distinction.

12:09.773 --> 12:10.972
Of course he does.

12:10.974 --> 12:12.507
He knew I'd react the same way Kyle did.

12:12.532 --> 12:14.599
That's why he came to
you in the first place.

12:14.711 --> 12:16.511
This isn't about Megan's talent

12:16.513 --> 12:18.061
or how right she is for the role.

12:18.086 --> 12:20.315
It's about the fact that
she's not a household name.

12:20.317 --> 12:22.530
We're not getting caught up in that.

12:23.233 --> 12:25.485
By all means, stay above the fray.

12:25.510 --> 12:27.299
But if this movie's a flop,

12:27.324 --> 12:29.245
the entire town will know
that Kyle tanked a movie

12:29.270 --> 12:31.025
to get his girlfriend a part.

12:36.037 --> 12:38.266
Bravo. Our leading lady.

12:40.357 --> 12:43.371
- There you are.
- There I am.

12:43.373 --> 12:45.160
Oh, look, there's Andres.

12:45.185 --> 12:46.777
- Hi, Andres. Hi.
- Hello.

12:46.802 --> 12:48.567
Love this guy.

12:48.592 --> 12:51.713
And he loves actresses.
Did you know that?

12:51.715 --> 12:54.482
He just loves meeting
them and talking with them.

12:54.484 --> 12:57.218
He's just an overall
great lover of actresses.

12:58.522 --> 13:00.188
Did you know Megan's an actress?

13:00.190 --> 13:04.259
She's also my best friend,
and we are ride or die.

13:04.261 --> 13:05.727
And if you don't know what
that means, I'll tell you.

13:05.729 --> 13:09.130
It means that we don't take shit...

13:09.132 --> 13:10.532
from anybody!

13:12.836 --> 13:15.912
We are all ride or die up in here,

13:15.937 --> 13:17.748
- and you and I need a drink.
- Mm.

13:17.773 --> 13:19.908
- Yeah, all right. I hear that.
- All right.

13:19.910 --> 13:21.422
Peace!

13:21.601 --> 13:23.154
Sorry about that.

13:25.282 --> 13:26.586
It's the bar, right here.

13:26.611 --> 13:28.342
- We're not going to the bar.
- What?

13:28.367 --> 13:30.391
Zach, can you have Jesse
get the car ready, please?

13:30.416 --> 13:32.987
- Yeah.
- Get the car ready? What is this?

13:32.989 --> 13:34.856
I am gonna have my guy take you home.

13:34.858 --> 13:36.958
Oh, I don't need your
guy to take me home.

13:36.960 --> 13:38.526
See, 'cause I just got here.

13:38.528 --> 13:40.595
And you definitely had some fun,

13:40.597 --> 13:43.331
but we need to sit the
rest of this one out.

13:45.052 --> 13:47.357
Why don't you drive me home?

13:48.338 --> 13:50.705
Sweetie... there's a lot
of great things happening

13:50.707 --> 13:52.551
for your friend right now.

13:52.576 --> 13:55.429
Trust me, you don't
want to screw that up.

13:57.846 --> 13:59.247
Now get some rest.

14:04.721 --> 14:06.754
Yeah. Thanks.

14:15.377 --> 14:16.531
Hope wasn't feeling well,

14:16.533 --> 14:18.432
so I sent her home with a driver.

14:19.338 --> 14:21.135
Thank you.

14:24.302 --> 14:26.235
No, I'm not brilliant, sweetie.

14:26.260 --> 14:29.188
I produce movies with smart
women about smart women,

14:29.213 --> 14:30.612
and I get rewarded.

14:30.614 --> 14:32.229
I just changed my mind about you.

14:32.254 --> 14:34.349
Sorry. I, uh... I geek out sometimes...

14:34.351 --> 14:36.227
well, a lot.

14:36.252 --> 14:38.286
And I still have bad intentions,

14:38.288 --> 14:39.883
but...

14:39.908 --> 14:41.643
I'm gonna recruit you, too.

14:41.668 --> 14:44.883
Ladies and gentlemen, Kyle
West and Megan Morrison.

14:48.064 --> 14:50.033
- Thank you.
- Congratulations.

14:51.582 --> 14:53.477
And I will take this as a
cue to leave. Give me a call.

14:53.502 --> 14:54.877
Megan and I are excited you all are here

14:54.902 --> 14:56.454
for the third annual fund-raiser

14:56.479 --> 14:58.144
for the Change of Clothes Foundation.

15:01.737 --> 15:03.987
- So all the money that we raise today...
- This is crazy.

15:04.020 --> 15:06.481
goes towards realizing
the vision of fashion

15:06.483 --> 15:07.963
as an instrument of change.

15:07.988 --> 15:10.192
Which means backing
up-and-coming designers

15:10.217 --> 15:11.894
who have pledged to abide by strict

15:11.919 --> 15:13.424
- environmental and social values
- _

15:13.449 --> 15:15.156
as they create their lines.

15:15.158 --> 15:18.167
We have one of these very
talented designers with us tonight,

15:18.192 --> 15:19.933
Maxwell Davis,

15:20.163 --> 15:22.307
who designed the dress
I'm very fortunate

15:22.332 --> 15:24.019
to be wearing right now.

15:24.044 --> 15:25.254
Thank you.

15:25.320 --> 15:26.648
Thank you all for coming.

15:26.729 --> 15:28.962
Please enjoy yourselves and, uh,

15:28.987 --> 15:30.218
keep those checks coming.

15:31.620 --> 15:33.319
- Way to go.
- Megan...

15:33.344 --> 15:35.351
- I need to speak with you.
- Now?

15:35.376 --> 15:36.961
Yeah, now.

15:38.862 --> 15:40.327
Okay.

15:40.352 --> 15:41.492
That's you, right?

15:41.517 --> 15:43.476
Jesus. What the hell is this?

15:43.501 --> 15:46.321
I don't know. Someone got your photos.

15:46.355 --> 15:48.766
- Oh, my God.
- I know.

15:48.791 --> 15:50.758
What's going on?

15:52.161 --> 15:54.719
All I can think is it... it was Nic.

15:55.024 --> 15:56.964
You know, he took the photos.

15:56.966 --> 15:58.983
And I haven't been returning his calls.

15:59.008 --> 16:00.968
How long ago did he take them?

16:00.970 --> 16:03.022
A year maybe.

16:03.047 --> 16:05.343
- So he has copies.
- No. No, no.

16:05.368 --> 16:06.945
I took them with my phone,

16:06.970 --> 16:09.093
and I deleted them months ago.

16:09.118 --> 16:11.045
But did you delete them off the cloud?

16:11.047 --> 16:13.876
Oh, God. The goddamn cloud.

16:13.901 --> 16:15.501
That's how he could've gotten them.

16:15.526 --> 16:16.829
Not in the last couple weeks.

16:16.854 --> 16:18.814
I mean, we encrypted everything
after Venice, didn't we?

16:18.839 --> 16:20.478
Yeah, we did,

16:20.503 --> 16:23.642
after we had the same problem
with another one of her friends.

16:25.152 --> 16:27.406
Sorry. People are wondering
whether they should go home.

16:28.597 --> 16:30.893
Yeah. Yeah, they should go home.

16:30.918 --> 16:32.284
Okay.

16:33.735 --> 16:35.441
The photos are everywhere.

16:35.466 --> 16:37.585
There isn't really
anything that we can do.

16:38.107 --> 16:40.574
Well, I'm gonna call Adam.
He should hear this from us.

16:40.576 --> 16:42.960
I'm sorry. You're concerned
about Adam right now?

16:47.254 --> 16:50.849
Well, the upside is
that you don't look awful

16:50.874 --> 16:53.179
and attention spans are short.

17:05.567 --> 17:08.244
- Hi.
- We have a problem.

17:08.270 --> 17:09.847
You saw the photos?

17:09.872 --> 17:11.739
Preteens in China have seen the photos.

17:11.763 --> 17:13.098
That's not the problem.

17:13.124 --> 17:15.376
Remember when I said I was
trying to get rid of the studio's

17:15.377 --> 17:17.077
ticky-tack bullshit in the contract?

17:17.079 --> 17:18.097
Yeah?

17:18.122 --> 17:19.810
Well, one of the things
I couldn't get rid of

17:19.835 --> 17:21.519
was the morality clause.

17:21.544 --> 17:23.884
- What the hell is that?
- It basically said

17:23.886 --> 17:27.153
that if you do anything
to bring disrepute,

17:27.178 --> 17:29.923
public ridicule, or
scandal to the project,

17:29.925 --> 17:31.825
they can terminate your contract.

17:31.827 --> 17:33.861
- Well, how is that relevant?
- Oh, sweetie,

17:33.863 --> 17:36.730
because the rumor is you
leaked the photos yourself

17:36.732 --> 17:38.457
as a publicity grab.

17:38.482 --> 17:39.902
What?

17:40.369 --> 17:42.569
Well... hold on. I have...
I have to call you back.

17:42.571 --> 17:43.870
What's going on?

17:43.895 --> 17:46.674
Apparently it's out there
that I did this myself,

17:46.676 --> 17:49.009
and Leslie says there's
a morality clause

17:49.011 --> 17:50.886
in the "Kill Plan" contract.

17:50.911 --> 17:53.247
So basically they can fire me.

17:54.020 --> 17:56.526
I don't understand who would do this.

18:21.125 --> 18:23.055
_

18:23.080 --> 18:25.314
_

18:27.895 --> 18:29.598
_

18:33.923 --> 18:36.102
_

18:36.127 --> 18:38.202
_

18:38.227 --> 18:40.951
Yeah, did he know about
the morality clause?

18:41.397 --> 18:43.097
Kyle, I know what you're thinking.

18:43.099 --> 18:44.974
No, just tell me.

18:45.302 --> 18:46.808
Yes, he knew.

18:46.833 --> 18:48.138
Adam wants us to come to the studio.

18:48.163 --> 18:51.435
- Can you be there in an hour?
- Yeah. See you soon.

19:01.775 --> 19:03.650
Hey, stop.

19:07.901 --> 19:10.468
How am I gonna prove
that I didn't do this?

19:12.806 --> 19:14.528
You're not.

19:14.530 --> 19:16.196
You're gonna pack a bag,

19:16.198 --> 19:18.321
and we're gonna get the hell out of L.A.

19:52.999 --> 19:55.366
- Beautiful, isn't it?
- Yeah.

19:56.337 --> 19:58.100
You come here a lot?

19:58.320 --> 19:59.912
Not enough.

20:00.206 --> 20:03.294
I'm usually pretty good at blocking
out all the noise in my life,

20:03.319 --> 20:05.006
but when it gets too tough,

20:05.031 --> 20:06.311
I come here.

20:06.336 --> 20:08.690
There's no Internet,
no cell phone service.

20:08.715 --> 20:11.148
It's like the outside
world doesn't even exist.

20:12.952 --> 20:14.873
It just got tough for you?

20:14.898 --> 20:16.585
It's not for me.

20:16.610 --> 20:18.350
This is for you.

20:19.325 --> 20:20.486
Come on.

20:20.511 --> 20:22.660
There are naked photographs
of your girlfriend

20:22.662 --> 20:24.395
taken by another guy,

20:24.397 --> 20:27.440
and everything people are
saying about them and me...

20:27.791 --> 20:30.010
it all reflects back to you.

20:30.035 --> 20:32.246
Not to mention the
studio is freaking out.

20:32.271 --> 20:33.572
Well...

20:33.597 --> 20:36.650
let everybody else get
caught up in all the bullshit.

20:37.343 --> 20:40.900
We'll focus on what actually matters.

20:42.604 --> 20:44.196
You know what?

20:44.261 --> 20:46.032
Look where we are.

20:46.919 --> 20:48.886
You want to take a walk?

20:50.718 --> 20:52.148
Come on.

20:54.397 --> 20:56.538
Okay, Kyle, I'm hoping you're
not in a ditch somewhere

20:56.563 --> 20:58.296
so I'd really appreciate
it if you called me

20:58.321 --> 21:00.077
and told me why you're
not here right now.

21:01.212 --> 21:03.062
He's obviously turned his phone off.

21:03.087 --> 21:04.252
Kyle's making a statement.

21:04.277 --> 21:06.037
I'm getting real familiar with it.

21:06.039 --> 21:07.422
There's no room for conversation.

21:07.447 --> 21:09.789
It's just his way or no way at all.

21:09.814 --> 21:11.351
It's not a conversation, Adam.

21:11.376 --> 21:13.943
It's you using the morality
clause to try and strong-arm him

21:13.968 --> 21:16.156
into doing something that
he doesn't want to do.

21:16.441 --> 21:18.575
I wasn't the one who
wanted it in the contract.

21:18.600 --> 21:19.984
Well, you're certainly
taking advantage of it.

21:20.009 --> 21:21.708
We have no proof that
Megan leaked the photos.

21:21.733 --> 21:23.333
Who says I need proof?

21:23.823 --> 21:26.471
It's already out there.
That's what matters.

21:28.898 --> 21:32.333
At the Institute, they always
say, "Life is a living thing."

21:32.515 --> 21:34.549
Life is a living thing.

21:35.568 --> 21:36.893
What it means is...

21:36.918 --> 21:39.313
life is constantly
changing moment to moment.

21:39.338 --> 21:42.206
I had heard it a thousand
times, and I was always like,

21:42.208 --> 21:44.588
"Yeah. Yeah, yeah, it is."

21:45.361 --> 21:47.845
Then when Lisbeth left me,

21:47.847 --> 21:50.214
I realized that I didn't
understand anything.

21:50.680 --> 21:53.516
Couldn't eat, couldn't get out of bed.

21:54.682 --> 21:55.829
And everything that I had learned

21:55.854 --> 21:58.282
was just a bunch of
useless clutter in my head.

22:00.235 --> 22:02.269
Then I saw this place.

22:03.505 --> 22:05.830
And for some reason, I stopped

22:05.832 --> 22:07.927
and just sat here and
watched the current.

22:09.325 --> 22:11.465
And it all started to make sense.

22:12.205 --> 22:13.838
Life is always moving.

22:13.840 --> 22:16.637
It's always taking us somewhere,
whether we see it or not.

22:17.566 --> 22:19.488
Nothing's permanent...

22:20.713 --> 22:22.613
least of all feelings.

22:31.824 --> 22:33.947
Where does this stream go?

22:38.189 --> 22:40.570
To a sewage plant about a mile away.

22:43.056 --> 22:46.003
- That's perfect.
- That's right.

22:47.840 --> 22:49.673
Do you mind if I order a glass of wine?

22:49.698 --> 22:51.184
Do you mind if I show you pictures

22:51.209 --> 22:52.926
of how we're decorating the nursery?

22:52.951 --> 22:55.185
- Sparkling water, please.
- Two.

22:57.049 --> 22:58.849
I appreciate you meeting me.

22:58.851 --> 23:01.402
I'm sure you're already
trying to convince Megan

23:01.427 --> 23:04.128
to fire me and move to CAA.

23:04.219 --> 23:05.707
Not yet.

23:06.936 --> 23:09.778
Well, that'll be a conversation
for a different time.

23:11.238 --> 23:13.783
Since I know Megan better than anyone,

23:13.808 --> 23:15.863
I thought maybe we could talk
about how to make the most

23:15.888 --> 23:20.283
of a very unfortunate situation.

23:20.308 --> 23:22.039
What did you have in mind?

23:22.041 --> 23:23.627
Focusing on the ex.

23:23.652 --> 23:26.477
You know, he forced her
into taking the pictures,

23:26.479 --> 23:28.913
and then he leaked them
when she had the courage

23:28.915 --> 23:32.588
to get out of a borderline
abusive relationship.

23:32.613 --> 23:34.899
That is very zeitgeist, D.

23:34.924 --> 23:37.760
Or we could just let the
whole thing blow over.

23:40.193 --> 23:42.159
Why leak the photos

23:42.161 --> 23:45.176
if you don't want to
make the most of them?

23:46.150 --> 23:48.637
You think I leaked the photos?

23:54.040 --> 23:55.489
Thanks.

23:56.122 --> 23:57.552
Little Megan in that big

23:57.592 --> 23:59.566
$200 million blockbuster?

23:59.606 --> 24:02.856
Come on. Adam Westfield had
to be shitting his pants.

24:02.881 --> 24:05.028
It's so much easier for you

24:05.084 --> 24:07.929
if suddenly the world knows who she is.

24:09.066 --> 24:11.179
It's easier for you, too.

24:11.657 --> 24:13.163
Maybe.

24:13.259 --> 24:15.859
But I'm not the one who had an IT guy

24:15.861 --> 24:18.062
at her house two weeks ago.

24:19.465 --> 24:21.366
I didn't leak the photos.

24:21.621 --> 24:22.944
Good.

24:24.810 --> 24:27.085
You can go ahead and order your wine.

24:33.546 --> 24:34.906
Kyle.

24:36.088 --> 24:37.339
Kyle.

24:37.450 --> 24:39.583
- Mm. Come here.
- No, stop, stop.

24:39.585 --> 24:41.524
What... what happened?

24:41.787 --> 24:43.438
Nothing.

24:43.463 --> 24:44.906
What?

24:45.580 --> 24:49.360
An hour ago, we were
totally connected, and now...

24:49.642 --> 24:52.398
I don't know, you're not
here, and I could feel it.

24:53.023 --> 24:54.222
I'm here, baby.

24:54.247 --> 24:55.980
- I'm right here.
- No...

24:58.295 --> 25:00.069
Is this about the photos?

25:00.094 --> 25:01.527
'Cause that would make total sense.

25:01.552 --> 25:03.986
Megan, I'm not thinking
about the photos.

25:04.110 --> 25:06.622
Can you just relax about that?

25:06.647 --> 25:10.347
I just want to know why you're
checked out while you kiss me.

25:10.349 --> 25:13.032
And don't tell me that
you're not, all right?

25:13.057 --> 25:14.978
I'm familiar with it.

25:15.541 --> 25:17.041
I don't know what I'm supposed to say.

25:17.066 --> 25:18.889
Maybe you want to tell me that, too.

25:19.321 --> 25:21.959
Wow. Okay, is this,
uh, annoying for you?

25:21.961 --> 25:24.273
Yeah, a little bit, yeah.

25:24.664 --> 25:26.196
You know...

25:26.198 --> 25:29.466
you gave me this long
speech about your past,

25:29.468 --> 25:30.934
and now it's me.

25:30.936 --> 25:33.904
And right now you have nothing?

25:35.383 --> 25:36.907
So this is about Lisbeth?

25:36.909 --> 25:38.575
- Figures.
- No.

25:38.577 --> 25:39.943
It's about you, Kyle,

25:39.945 --> 25:42.695
but maybe now I finally
know why she left.

25:45.516 --> 25:46.977
I'm sorry.

25:48.120 --> 25:49.787
Hey, I'm gonna... I'm gonna take a walk.

25:56.428 --> 25:58.301
Kyle!

25:59.184 --> 26:01.031
Kyle?

26:04.265 --> 26:05.929
Kyle.

26:06.226 --> 26:08.390
I'm sorry.

26:09.071 --> 26:10.537
Oh.

26:10.562 --> 26:13.304
Kyle, please talk to me.

26:28.749 --> 26:30.449
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

26:30.451 --> 26:32.917
I tripped. That branch is
not supposed to be there.

26:32.942 --> 26:34.472
Yeah, that's what the flashlight's for.

26:34.497 --> 26:36.163
Well, I wasn't shining it down.

26:36.188 --> 26:39.289
I was shining it out because
I was looking for you...

26:39.493 --> 26:41.126
and also bears.

26:51.272 --> 26:53.872
I'm sorry for what I said.

26:53.874 --> 26:55.674
It was horrible.

26:59.066 --> 27:00.527
You were right.

27:00.552 --> 27:02.652
I wasn't being honest.

27:03.651 --> 27:05.863
Those pictures got to me.

27:06.086 --> 27:08.669
It's not that you were naked
or even with another dude.

27:08.694 --> 27:10.728
I mean, we all have a past.

27:10.978 --> 27:13.660
But I saw that smile on your face.

27:14.240 --> 27:16.310
My smile?

27:18.546 --> 27:19.888
Look...

27:20.334 --> 27:22.497
in one of those pictures, you were...

27:24.648 --> 27:26.794
you were smiling in
this incredible way...

27:26.819 --> 27:28.974
at Nic, I guess.

27:28.999 --> 27:30.825
But I recognized it,

27:31.076 --> 27:34.763
'cause you smiled at me the
exact same way in Mexico.

27:37.101 --> 27:40.153
It just... it scared the shit
out of me to think that...

27:42.323 --> 27:44.200
like, I mean, we talked about
it today, right? I mean...

27:44.225 --> 27:47.114
everything changes. Nothing's permanent.

27:48.128 --> 27:49.591
Kyle...

27:49.616 --> 27:51.505
It's ju... I don't want
us to end up with nothing

27:51.530 --> 27:53.497
except some photos and...

27:54.568 --> 27:56.927
a bunch of shitty feelings.

27:57.671 --> 27:59.605
I can't do that again.

28:02.910 --> 28:04.610
I love you.

28:11.917 --> 28:13.644
I love you, too.

28:53.794 --> 28:55.093
What are you doing?

28:55.095 --> 28:57.106
I have to pee badly.

28:57.131 --> 28:59.012
Well, you can just go
right outside the door.

28:59.037 --> 29:01.371
- I'm going to.
- Why you getting dressed?

29:01.435 --> 29:03.235
You scared the bears
are gonna see you naked?

29:06.829 --> 29:08.073
What?

29:08.230 --> 29:11.665
I'm not scared of
anyone seeing me naked.

29:15.559 --> 29:17.016
Okay.

29:17.695 --> 29:19.256
You sure you're okay with this?

29:19.281 --> 29:21.601
I am more than okay
with this, all right?

29:21.626 --> 29:23.305
I love this idea.

29:24.008 --> 29:25.320
All right.

29:25.945 --> 29:27.893
Naked in the woods.

29:27.895 --> 29:30.329
- Naked in the woods.
- Whoo!

29:30.331 --> 29:33.264
- Taking my power back.
- Get that power back.

29:33.289 --> 29:36.172
Okay, I think I'm warm enough now.

29:36.305 --> 29:39.328
And I'm already screwed with
this morality-clause thing,

29:39.353 --> 29:42.391
so don't be afraid to go a little sexy.

29:47.448 --> 29:49.621
You know what? This isn't right.

29:49.646 --> 29:52.763
What? No. What do you mean?
This is... this is totally right.

29:52.974 --> 29:55.787
No, it isn't, not yet.

30:02.796 --> 30:04.763
Kyle just showed up.

30:04.765 --> 30:07.529
- He's here?
- Not exactly.

30:12.551 --> 30:14.317
It's already got a million likes.

30:14.342 --> 30:15.807
Yeah, I can see that.

30:15.809 --> 30:18.075
_

30:18.379 --> 30:20.497
- Try him again.
- Okay.

30:22.256 --> 30:24.786
Uh, a-actually, don't.
Get me Adam instead.

30:24.811 --> 30:26.419
O-okay.

30:27.021 --> 30:29.054
Adam Westfield's office, please.

30:31.044 --> 30:32.591
And there she is. I mean, look,

30:32.623 --> 30:35.255
this girl has absolutely zero training,

30:35.271 --> 30:36.938
but yet her instincts are amazing.

30:36.940 --> 30:38.139
She reframed the narrative.

30:38.141 --> 30:39.941
She came up with the idea herself.

30:39.943 --> 30:42.075
I had to do it with her.

30:43.713 --> 30:45.313
Well, hey, there's nothing
like getting your penis

30:45.315 --> 30:46.597
in the public record, right?

30:48.495 --> 30:50.409
Look, the morality clause is dead.

30:50.434 --> 30:53.330
If they want to bounce her,
they got to bounce me, too.

30:53.690 --> 30:56.791
Now, B&A is doing a
piece on Internet shaming,

30:56.793 --> 30:58.409
and they want to interview us.

30:58.434 --> 31:00.924
I mean, we're spinning this
whole thing into a positive.

31:01.731 --> 31:03.214
So you're in a good place?

31:03.239 --> 31:05.290
I'm in a great place.

31:07.661 --> 31:09.222
And how about us? How are we?

31:13.080 --> 31:15.143
Okay, come on, man, let's just, uh...

31:15.145 --> 31:16.444
let's be real with each other.

31:16.446 --> 31:18.980
You think I leaked
those photos, don't you?

31:18.982 --> 31:22.517
Yes, or leaked the rumor
that Megan did it...

31:22.519 --> 31:24.034
or both.

31:25.288 --> 31:26.788
Well, thanks for being honest.

31:26.790 --> 31:28.243
Um, I'll do the same.

31:28.268 --> 31:29.555
Fire away.

31:30.126 --> 31:32.660
I haven't exactly been sold on Megan.

31:32.662 --> 31:34.429
I guess you've sensed that.

31:34.431 --> 31:36.664
She's... she's beautiful.
She's a good actress.

31:36.666 --> 31:40.034
But whatever this other thing is
that you and Deanne see in her,

31:40.036 --> 31:41.979
it's been lost on me...

31:42.004 --> 31:43.439
until now.

31:44.692 --> 31:46.325
She makes you happy.

31:46.350 --> 31:49.654
And I care about you, so I'm all-in...

31:50.728 --> 31:52.076
Truly.

31:55.152 --> 31:57.535
Thanks, man. That really
means the world to me.

31:59.037 --> 32:01.571
Look, nothing's more important
to me than your best interests,

32:01.596 --> 32:03.963
and Megan's best interests
are a big part of that now.

32:03.988 --> 32:05.426
We're all doing this together.

32:05.451 --> 32:07.215
That's exactly how I feel.

32:07.564 --> 32:09.197
Good...

32:09.199 --> 32:12.120
because an opportunity has just come up.

32:12.435 --> 32:14.268
Okay, so, you know,
we'll have a lead-in

32:14.270 --> 32:17.605
with some B-roll of, you know,
other celebrity photo leaks...

32:17.607 --> 32:19.688
you know, Kate Upton, Jennifer Lawrence.

32:19.713 --> 32:20.948
Then we're gonna cut to the interview.

32:20.973 --> 32:22.353
That's gonna go for about three minutes.

32:22.378 --> 32:23.818
You guys know how we do things.

32:23.843 --> 32:25.757
Just keep the energy up. Keep
it nice and conversational.

32:25.782 --> 32:28.553
And just so we're clear... she's
asking the approved questions only.

32:28.578 --> 32:31.270
That's the plan, but it is live TV.

32:31.481 --> 32:33.106
Yeah. Can someone explain to me

32:33.131 --> 32:35.037
the point of even doing
anything live anymore?

32:35.062 --> 32:36.614
It's antiquated.

32:36.639 --> 32:38.593
Oh, oh, okay. Oh, you want to quote me?

32:38.595 --> 32:40.092
Okay, how about this?

32:40.117 --> 32:41.763
It's bullshit.

32:41.765 --> 32:44.426
Brandon, I don't know where
you're getting your information,

32:44.451 --> 32:46.223
but you're gonna embarrass yourself.

32:46.248 --> 32:48.503
And my client has had
quite enough for one week,

32:48.505 --> 32:51.326
so move on, please.

32:54.474 --> 32:55.740
What's going on?

32:55.765 --> 32:57.810
Oh, they're Dumpster diving at Deadline.

32:57.835 --> 32:59.714
- Don't worry about it.
- What did he ask you?

32:59.716 --> 33:03.551
He wanted me to comment
on this nonsense rumor

33:03.553 --> 33:06.935
that Amelia Briggs has replaced
Megan in "The Kill Plan."

33:06.960 --> 33:08.156
That's a rumor?

33:08.158 --> 33:09.957
The keep getting better and better.

33:11.321 --> 33:12.841
Hey, come on, let's go talk.

33:12.866 --> 33:14.028
Wait. What?

33:14.030 --> 33:16.164
- What the hell is going on?
- I have no idea.

33:16.166 --> 33:18.861
So it's true? I'm being replaced?

33:18.886 --> 33:20.052
- Megan, Megan...
- Megan...

33:20.077 --> 33:22.057
Just tell me what the hell is going on.

33:23.706 --> 33:25.973
I got a call from
Amelia's rep yesterday.

33:25.975 --> 33:28.141
Dan Buckleman... he's a total prick,

33:28.166 --> 33:30.891
but he's Institute, so
we know how that works.

33:30.916 --> 33:32.313
We got lucky.

33:32.315 --> 33:34.682
She's dropping out of her
current project to do ours.

33:34.684 --> 33:36.984
She's box office equity.
It's a no-brainer.

33:36.986 --> 33:40.188
- So it's about money?
- For the studio.

33:40.213 --> 33:41.993
For me, it's about protecting you.

33:42.018 --> 33:44.025
I don't need you to protect me.

33:44.027 --> 33:46.594
And I'm sorry, but Amelia Briggs?

33:46.596 --> 33:48.429
Look, you were the better actor,

33:48.431 --> 33:50.965
but throwing you into a giant
franchise right out the gate,

33:50.967 --> 33:52.283
it's not in your best interests.

33:52.308 --> 33:54.542
Why don't you let Megan and
her agent make that decision?

33:54.567 --> 33:56.025
And why don't you let Kyle speak?

33:56.050 --> 33:57.588
Why don't you, Terrence?

33:57.613 --> 33:59.116
Your name isn't even on the movie.

33:59.142 --> 34:01.399
You get one chance to prove yourself.

34:01.424 --> 34:02.533
And I don't want everyone thinking

34:02.558 --> 34:04.096
you're only in the movie because of me.

34:04.121 --> 34:05.922
That will be the narrative.

34:05.947 --> 34:07.992
The whole world's gonna
want to see you fail,

34:08.016 --> 34:09.984
and I'm not gonna set you up for that.

34:10.657 --> 34:14.467
You felt completely different
about this two days ago.

34:14.493 --> 34:16.924
How do you just change
your mind like that?

34:16.926 --> 34:18.391
Look, come here.

34:22.998 --> 34:24.732
Jesus, Kyle.

34:24.734 --> 34:27.735
- I told you I love you.
- And I love you.

34:27.737 --> 34:29.063
Look, now the studio owes me,

34:29.088 --> 34:30.788
so they're gonna have to
let me direct the next movie.

34:30.813 --> 34:32.132
Oh. Oh, you're gonna direct.

34:32.158 --> 34:33.958
That was your trade-off
for getting rid of me?

34:33.983 --> 34:35.304
No, that's not what I'm saying.

34:35.330 --> 34:36.774
What I'm saying is...

34:36.884 --> 34:38.684
is that I'm gonna have
final approval on casting.

34:38.708 --> 34:40.553
We'll get to do the movie together.

34:40.578 --> 34:42.851
Look, I am dying to work with you.

34:44.882 --> 34:46.721
Until you're not.

34:46.723 --> 34:48.856
Okay, we are ready for you guys.

34:48.858 --> 34:51.092
That's too bad, because
there's no way in hell

34:51.094 --> 34:52.793
she's doing this interview now.

34:52.795 --> 34:54.594
I'm sorry. We're gonna have to cancel.

34:54.597 --> 34:55.868
You know what? I'm sure...

34:55.893 --> 34:58.086
No, we're gonna do it.

35:02.398 --> 35:04.252
Okay, then.

35:09.941 --> 35:12.341
And I'm just naked as
a bear in the woods.

35:12.415 --> 35:13.610
Really?

35:13.635 --> 35:15.782
And then all of a sudden, he
started taking off his clothes,

35:15.807 --> 35:17.531
and then I realized what he was doing.

35:17.556 --> 35:18.686
So...

35:18.688 --> 35:21.165
Well, look, she looked so cold.
I couldn't let her suffer alone.

35:21.190 --> 35:24.390
Well, you two made a beautiful picture

35:24.415 --> 35:27.001
that just happened to make an
important statement at the same time.

35:27.026 --> 35:28.118
Congratulations.

35:28.143 --> 35:29.542
And thank you so very much

35:29.567 --> 35:31.618
for taking the time to
sit down with me today.

35:31.643 --> 35:34.283
Actually, I'd like
to say something else.

35:35.885 --> 35:37.758
Oh, okay. Of course.

35:40.263 --> 35:43.821
There are people out there
who want to see you fail.

35:43.846 --> 35:46.062
And they'll look at everything
that happened the past few days

35:46.087 --> 35:49.617
and think, "Oh, well, look at
how much publicity she got."

35:49.619 --> 35:52.986
And all I can say about that is...

35:53.509 --> 35:56.190
that none of it is worth
spending a second of your life

35:56.192 --> 35:58.017
feeling powerless.

35:58.042 --> 36:00.726
And if there's anything
that this has taught me,

36:00.751 --> 36:04.798
it's that I can choose
not to feel powerless.

36:05.744 --> 36:08.269
And I'll never let that happen again.

36:11.407 --> 36:14.361
Megan is the most
powerful person I know.

36:14.837 --> 36:17.945
Well, you two make an incredible couple.

36:17.947 --> 36:20.552
Thank you again for
sitting down with me today.

36:20.577 --> 36:22.049
Thank you.

36:22.051 --> 36:24.147
And we're out.

36:24.733 --> 36:27.188
- Wow. Guys, that was great.
- Yeah, it was a pleasure.

36:27.190 --> 36:28.923
- Thank you. Great interview.
- Thanks.

36:28.925 --> 36:30.725
Very nice to meet you.

36:30.727 --> 36:32.059
Megan.

36:46.084 --> 36:49.442
So... have you talked to Megan?

36:49.466 --> 36:51.767
Mm, not since the party.

36:51.989 --> 36:53.902
She's too busy with her fake life.

36:53.904 --> 36:55.231
What are you talking about?

36:55.256 --> 36:58.250
Oh, I-I guess you didn't see
how she was acting that night.

36:58.275 --> 37:00.542
I saw how you were acting.

37:00.544 --> 37:02.711
Well, at least I was real.

37:02.713 --> 37:04.831
She ran around that party like,

37:04.856 --> 37:07.749
"Look at me. I'm
Hollywood's newest ingénue."

37:07.751 --> 37:09.442
Two weeks ago, I was
holding her hair back

37:09.467 --> 37:10.829
while she puked in bushes.

37:10.854 --> 37:13.192
I was actually the one holding her hair.

37:13.217 --> 37:16.104
Things change for people.
There's nothing wrong with that.

37:16.129 --> 37:18.226
She doesn't even return our calls.

37:18.228 --> 37:19.954
I can't believe you're cool with that.

37:19.979 --> 37:22.641
Are you seriously playing
the jilted friend right now?

37:22.666 --> 37:25.434
Oh, God, I can't believe
you don't see this.

37:25.436 --> 37:29.109
Her guy kicked me out of his party...

37:29.134 --> 37:32.187
- Hope, no he...
- And then passed me off to his driver,

37:32.212 --> 37:33.442
who totally manhandled me

37:33.444 --> 37:35.544
when I told him to piss off, by the way.

37:35.546 --> 37:36.681
You were pretty wasted.

37:36.706 --> 37:38.773
Are you sure that's how it went down?

37:39.016 --> 37:41.950
Kyle West is not a good guy.

37:41.952 --> 37:43.251
Shh.

37:43.253 --> 37:45.992
I saw it in his eyes. He's fake.

37:46.017 --> 37:48.876
He acts sweet and
perfect, and it's bullshit.

37:48.901 --> 37:52.275
He's really just a product of
the Institute of the Higher Mind,

37:52.563 --> 37:56.212
which I've also heard
terrible stories about.

37:57.118 --> 37:59.577
And now he's got his hooks into Megan.

37:59.618 --> 38:02.017
- I think that...
- She's getting totally sucked in,

38:02.042 --> 38:03.341
and it needs to stop,

38:03.366 --> 38:05.158
and that was the whole
point of the photos.

38:05.183 --> 38:06.845
Wait. What?

38:07.071 --> 38:09.759
You're the one who leaked the photos?

38:10.626 --> 38:12.481
Are you serious?

38:14.324 --> 38:16.134
Hope.

38:16.442 --> 38:17.765
Wha...

38:17.790 --> 38:19.367
How did you get them?

38:19.392 --> 38:21.022
I copied them from her phone

38:21.024 --> 38:22.624
when we were at Ace for New Year's,

38:22.626 --> 38:25.093
'cause I was gonna make her
a gag gift for her birthday,

38:25.095 --> 38:26.486
but...

38:26.511 --> 38:28.704
What? Don't do that.
Don't look at me like that.

38:28.729 --> 38:31.790
Oh, my God, this is sick, Hope.

38:33.118 --> 38:36.095
- It was for her own good.
- Oh, bullshit.

38:36.121 --> 38:38.517
That's bullshit. You want to be real?

38:38.675 --> 38:40.776
It was all about you.

38:40.778 --> 38:42.508
You saw yourself in Megan's rear-view

38:42.533 --> 38:44.212
the moment you walked into that party.

38:44.214 --> 38:46.248
You decided you weren't gonna fit in.

38:46.250 --> 38:47.828
Well, I tried.

38:47.853 --> 38:50.452
Well, a real friend would try harder.

38:50.454 --> 38:51.920
And if she can't do that,

38:51.922 --> 38:54.269
she would just get the
hell out of the way.

39:31.401 --> 39:33.764
I figured you weren't
answering your phone.

39:33.789 --> 39:35.554
You figured right.

39:35.812 --> 39:38.234
It's okay. I'm not gonna stay.

39:38.468 --> 39:40.148
What do you want, then?

39:40.955 --> 39:41.961
I want to tell you that...

39:41.986 --> 39:43.812
you handled yourself really
well at the studio today.

39:43.837 --> 39:46.867
I was very impressed, and, um...

39:47.890 --> 39:49.444
you know, as a woman in this business,

39:49.446 --> 39:52.714
you sometimes have to accept
things that you don't like

39:52.716 --> 39:54.953
because you have your
eye on a bigger prize.

39:55.328 --> 39:57.961
Look, I really don't want
another explanation right now.

39:57.986 --> 40:00.242
It's not an explanation, Megan.

40:01.365 --> 40:03.969
You know, I really came here to tell you

40:03.994 --> 40:06.942
that things aren't always gonna
be this way for you and me.

40:07.973 --> 40:11.132
We're not always going to
be the women behind the men.

40:11.134 --> 40:12.848
That's gonna change.

40:13.537 --> 40:15.294
I promise.

40:20.333 --> 40:23.583
Terrence. Sorry. She just kind of...

40:23.614 --> 40:25.046
It's fine.

40:25.048 --> 40:28.309
Mr. Anderson, I'm Detective Gaffe, LAPD.

40:29.090 --> 40:31.364
Sorry to interrupt. I didn't
realize that your organization

40:31.389 --> 40:33.317
endorsed that kind of stuff.

40:33.599 --> 40:36.734
Oh, moderation's the
key, like anything else.

40:36.916 --> 40:38.324
What can I do for you?

40:38.349 --> 40:40.762
Actually, I have a missing-persons case.

40:43.248 --> 40:45.144
Sofie Marchuk...
according to her family,

40:45.169 --> 40:47.412
she took courses at your institute.

40:47.437 --> 40:49.104
Do you have a couple minutes?

40:49.488 --> 40:52.168
- I just have a few questions.
- Absolutely.

40:52.504 --> 40:53.726
Great.

41:04.254 --> 41:05.463
Hey.

41:05.807 --> 41:08.775
I know you don't want to
talk to me, and I get it.

41:08.800 --> 41:10.700
I-I just want to say that...

41:10.725 --> 41:13.238
well, when you're ready, I'm here.

41:14.898 --> 41:16.865
Hey, the other option is...

41:16.867 --> 41:18.422
we don't have to talk.

41:18.447 --> 41:21.875
You can come over, scream
and yell and break stuff.

41:22.140 --> 41:24.203
I-I'm totally fine with that.

41:24.574 --> 41:26.617
Just putting that out there.

41:28.758 --> 41:31.727
Okay, I screwed this up.

41:31.752 --> 41:33.551
I love you, Megan.

41:33.576 --> 41:35.672
That's the first thing I should've said.

41:36.687 --> 41:38.149
I love you.

41:39.456 --> 41:41.016
That's it.

41:53.282 --> 41:56.289
So, I read that you
two met at an audition.

41:56.468 --> 41:59.687
- Is it a real story?
- That is a real story.

42:00.632 --> 42:02.375
Wow, you got a job and a boyfriend.

42:02.400 --> 42:03.805
Now, that's a good audition, girl.

42:03.829 --> 42:05.398
Just the boyfriend...

42:05.445 --> 42:07.256
but still a good audition.

42:07.281 --> 42:09.523
Tell the truth. Was
there really a movie?

42:09.554 --> 42:11.742
Or were you just auditioning
her to be your girlfriend?

42:11.767 --> 42:14.422
- Stop tripping.
- What? You don't think that happens?

42:14.447 --> 42:17.413
I mean, that's what they do at
the Institute of the Higher Mind
