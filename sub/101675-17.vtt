00:01.610 --> 00:03.481
Previously on
Young Sheldon...

00:03.525 --> 00:06.136
Dr. Sturgis will be
joining us for dinner.

00:06.180 --> 00:07.659
I thought he was
in the nuthouse.

00:07.703 --> 00:09.270
We do not call it that.

00:09.313 --> 00:10.836
That's what Dad calls it.

00:11.837 --> 00:15.754
I don't think we should be in
a romantic relationship anymore.

00:15.798 --> 00:17.060
Are you crazy?

00:17.104 --> 00:19.367
I mean, poor choice of words,
but...

00:19.410 --> 00:20.890
are you crazy?!

00:20.933 --> 00:23.849
Did you know there's
a, uh, supercollider

00:23.893 --> 00:25.721
being built
in Waxahachie, Texas?

00:26.722 --> 00:28.463
No.

00:28.506 --> 00:30.334
I've taken a job there.

00:30.378 --> 00:32.554
Well, I hope that you're ready

00:32.597 --> 00:34.643
to hear him freak out
when you tell him.

00:34.686 --> 00:35.861
A supercollider?!

00:35.905 --> 00:37.559
Well, you can't say no to that.

00:37.602 --> 00:38.908
I give up.

00:38.951 --> 00:40.475
Ooh, can you get me
a bumper sticker?

00:43.130 --> 00:45.828
ADULT SHELDON:
I never cared for surprises.

00:45.871 --> 00:49.788
My meemaw, on the other hand,
thought they were "a hoot."

00:49.832 --> 00:52.661
And it's a good thing, because
instead of finding the paper

00:52.704 --> 00:54.793
on her doorstep, she found...

00:54.837 --> 00:55.881
[doorbell rings][Meemaw gasps]

00:55.925 --> 00:57.100
What are you doing here?

00:57.144 --> 00:59.015
I wanted to surprise you.

00:59.059 --> 01:00.538
Mission accomplished.

01:00.582 --> 01:02.149
Oh, good.

01:04.151 --> 01:07.850
So how's everything going
with your supercollider?

01:07.893 --> 01:10.635
Well, up until Wednesday

01:10.679 --> 01:13.595
at 6:43, wonderful.

01:13.638 --> 01:16.076
What happened at 6:43?

01:16.119 --> 01:18.426
That's when they fired me.

01:18.469 --> 01:20.863
What? Why did they fire you?

01:20.906 --> 01:24.997
Eh, probably because
of what happened at 6:14.

01:26.042 --> 01:28.088
REPORTER: So, Dr. Sturgis,
what would you say

01:28.131 --> 01:29.828
to local residents
who are concerned

01:29.872 --> 01:31.743
about the supercollider's
safety?

01:31.787 --> 01:33.267
Is there a chance
that Waxahachie

01:33.310 --> 01:34.442
could be the next Chernobyl?

01:34.485 --> 01:36.052
Absolutely not.

01:36.096 --> 01:38.315
The supercollider is
very different

01:38.359 --> 01:40.274
from a nuclear power plant.

01:40.317 --> 01:42.450
This can't
melt down.

01:42.493 --> 01:43.973
The worst it could do would be

01:44.016 --> 01:47.324
to create
a microscopic black hole.

01:47.368 --> 01:48.804
And what would that do?

01:48.847 --> 01:50.675
Well, it's unlikely,

01:50.719 --> 01:53.417
but, uh, it could grow

01:53.461 --> 01:56.464
until it swallowed up
the entire Earth.

01:56.507 --> 01:59.119
And possibly the Moon.

02:00.468 --> 02:01.469
Next question.

02:02.557 --> 02:05.429
♪ Nobody else
is stronger than I am ♪

02:05.473 --> 02:08.302

02:08.345 --> 02:11.000

02:11.043 --> 02:13.872

02:13.916 --> 02:16.571

02:21.489 --> 02:23.578
Do you really think
your supercollider

02:23.621 --> 02:25.275
could make a black hole?

02:25.319 --> 02:26.842
There is about

02:26.885 --> 02:28.974
a one-in-a-trillion chance
it could.

02:29.018 --> 02:32.369
Friendly advice-- next time
somebody asks you if your work

02:32.413 --> 02:34.066
could destroy
the world,

02:34.110 --> 02:36.112
just say no.

02:36.156 --> 02:39.202
I'm not sure there's
gonna be a next time.

02:39.246 --> 02:40.464
What do you mean?

02:40.508 --> 02:43.075
I've been doing science
all my life.

02:43.119 --> 02:46.253
[stammers] It's time
for something else.

02:46.296 --> 02:47.254
Like what?

02:47.297 --> 02:49.212
Maybe scrimshaw?

02:49.256 --> 02:52.259
That's, uh, carving art
into whale bone.

02:52.302 --> 02:55.000
You really want to spend
your day carving a whale bone?

02:55.044 --> 02:57.351
I don't know
what else I'd do with it.

02:57.394 --> 03:00.223
Oh, come on, you're a scientist.

03:00.267 --> 03:01.616
This is just silly.

03:01.659 --> 03:03.618
Connie...

03:03.661 --> 03:07.230
I'm 72 and just lost
my dream job.

03:07.274 --> 03:09.058
[chuckles]

03:09.101 --> 03:11.234
Right now, uh...

03:11.278 --> 03:13.454
I think I need to, uh...

03:13.497 --> 03:15.151
take a step back.

03:15.195 --> 03:19.024
The Texan in me wants to say
get back on the horse.

03:20.243 --> 03:22.202
But I won't.

03:24.508 --> 03:26.118
SHELDON:
It's so exciting he's back.

03:26.162 --> 03:27.294
How did he look?

03:27.337 --> 03:28.643
The same.

03:28.686 --> 03:30.993
Good, I was afraid
he might've shrunk more.

03:31.036 --> 03:33.517
Although maybe you both shrunk
and you couldn't tell.

03:33.561 --> 03:34.866
Hey!

03:34.910 --> 03:37.826
I'm still taller than you,
so watch it.

03:37.869 --> 03:40.307
It'll be great to have him back
at the university.

03:40.350 --> 03:43.484
Actually... doesn't sound
like he's going back.

03:43.527 --> 03:45.050
Why not?

03:45.094 --> 03:47.618
He's a little upset
about getting fired,

03:47.662 --> 03:50.491
and... says he's ready
for a change.

03:50.534 --> 03:53.102
An old person trying
something new? That's funny.

03:53.145 --> 03:55.931
You'll be old
one day, too, pal.

03:55.974 --> 03:57.628
I already don't like new things.

03:57.672 --> 03:59.108
Bring it on.

03:59.151 --> 04:01.197
Why would I rehire him?

04:01.241 --> 04:03.939
He just caused a panic
about the supercollider.

04:03.982 --> 04:06.158
They say there's no such thing
as bad publicity.

04:06.202 --> 04:08.596
That's a quote from P.T. Barnum.I don't care.

04:08.639 --> 04:10.424
Do you care that
the "P" stood for Phineas?

04:10.467 --> 04:12.774
No.Then I won't tell you
what the "T" stood for.

04:12.817 --> 04:14.471
Great.Taylor.

04:14.515 --> 04:17.953
Sheldon, Dr. Sturgis quit right
before the semester started.

04:17.996 --> 04:19.433
He left me in the lurch.

04:19.476 --> 04:21.304
And this is your chance
to be the bigger person.

04:21.348 --> 04:23.088
I don't want to be
the bigger person.

04:23.132 --> 04:25.482
I'll be the small, petty person.
That's way more fun.

04:26.788 --> 04:29.356
Please? It would make me
really happy if he came back.

04:29.399 --> 04:31.793
And you said yourself
my happiness is important

04:31.836 --> 04:32.968
to the university.

04:33.011 --> 04:34.970
Are you trying to manipulate me?

04:35.013 --> 04:37.494
Hey, being
small and petty is fun.

04:38.321 --> 04:40.018
Anyway, Dr. Sturgis, we'd love

04:40.062 --> 04:42.020
to have you back here.

04:43.108 --> 04:44.675
What do you mean, "other job"?

04:44.719 --> 04:45.981
What other job?

04:46.024 --> 04:48.244
STURGIS:
Hi, Mary.

04:49.376 --> 04:50.594
Hey, John.

04:50.638 --> 04:52.161
What are you doing here?

04:52.204 --> 04:53.771
Well, I lost my job.

04:53.815 --> 04:57.166
So while I'm figuring
things out, I'm a bag boy.

04:57.209 --> 04:58.994
Although at my age,

04:59.037 --> 05:00.909
"boy" is pushing it.
[laughs]

05:00.952 --> 05:03.215
Aren't you a little...

05:03.259 --> 05:04.913
[whispers]:
overqualified?

05:04.956 --> 05:06.741
[whispers]:
Very.

05:07.568 --> 05:10.745
Hey, why don't you join us
for dinner this weekend.

05:10.788 --> 05:12.921
Sheldon would love to see you.

05:12.964 --> 05:15.097
Oh, that'd be wonderful.

05:15.140 --> 05:16.751
MAN [over P.A.]:
Cleanup on aisle two.

05:16.794 --> 05:19.754
That's me.
Madge, can you finish up here?

05:19.797 --> 05:21.843
I have a date with a mop.

05:21.886 --> 05:24.019
[chuckling]

05:24.933 --> 05:27.327
He's really smart.

05:30.417 --> 05:33.594
Thanks for inviting John
to dinner tonight.

05:33.637 --> 05:35.117
Oh, my pleasure.

05:35.160 --> 05:36.771
I've been a little bit
worried about him.

05:36.814 --> 05:39.643
You know,
with what happened last time.

05:39.687 --> 05:42.254
At least he didn't seem unstable
when I talked to him.

05:42.298 --> 05:44.996
The man has
a doctorate in science,

05:45.040 --> 05:46.955
and he's filling
people's grocery bags.

05:46.998 --> 05:49.436
He actually did
a really nice job.

05:49.479 --> 05:51.394
He put the heavy things
on the bottom.

05:51.438 --> 05:53.353
He kept
the cold things together.

05:53.396 --> 05:55.006
Mary.

05:55.050 --> 05:56.399
Well, they don't always do that.

05:56.443 --> 05:58.662
I just hate to see him
give up like this.

05:58.706 --> 05:59.837
Who you talking about?

05:59.881 --> 06:01.143
Dr. Sturgis.

06:01.186 --> 06:02.449
What'd he give up?

06:02.492 --> 06:03.537
Science.

06:03.580 --> 06:05.103
He's working at a grocery store.

06:05.147 --> 06:06.583
At least he didn't give up
being weird.

06:06.627 --> 06:08.150
He is also coming over

06:08.193 --> 06:09.891
for dinner, so behave yourself.

06:09.934 --> 06:12.284
I can behave at school
or I can behave at home.

06:12.328 --> 06:12.894
I can't do both.

06:14.983 --> 06:17.507
Well, it's so wonderful
to see you all.

06:17.551 --> 06:19.161
Thank you for having me.

06:19.204 --> 06:20.554
It's great to see you, too.

06:20.597 --> 06:23.165
And, Mary, I believe I recognize

06:23.208 --> 06:24.427
these tater tots

06:24.471 --> 06:26.429
from when I packed them
in your bag.

06:26.473 --> 06:28.170
You're killing me.

06:37.135 --> 06:39.747
So you work at the
grocery store now?

06:39.790 --> 06:41.139
I do.

06:41.183 --> 06:44.708
Just out of curiosity,
would you say I look 21?

06:44.752 --> 06:45.796
Mm, I suppose.

06:45.840 --> 06:47.145
And what nights
do you work again?

06:47.189 --> 06:48.495
He's not selling you beer.

06:48.538 --> 06:50.801
Well, of course not.

06:51.933 --> 06:53.282
I can't believe
they would fire you

06:53.325 --> 06:55.502
just for mentioning a theory
about black holes.

06:55.545 --> 06:56.851
It's just as well.

06:56.894 --> 07:00.376
It was time this old horse
was put out to pasture.

07:00.420 --> 07:01.377
Don't say that.

07:01.421 --> 07:02.857
You're not old.

07:02.900 --> 07:04.249
He's not?
No.

07:04.293 --> 07:06.469
But look at his bald head.Eat your peas.

07:06.513 --> 07:08.166
I can't understand
why you wouldn't want

07:08.210 --> 07:09.951
to come back to
the university.

07:09.994 --> 07:12.693
Science is
a young man's game.

07:12.736 --> 07:14.303
But we could work on
something together.

07:14.346 --> 07:15.565
If you average out
our ages,

07:15.609 --> 07:18.002
we're a lean, mean
41 and a half.

07:18.046 --> 07:20.570
Still too old
to be bagging groceries.

07:20.614 --> 07:22.964
I know it's unorthodox,

07:23.007 --> 07:25.836
but I'm enjoying it.[siren blaring]

07:27.751 --> 07:29.492
Tornado this time of year?

07:29.536 --> 07:31.712
There's not a cloud in the sky.

07:38.327 --> 07:41.722
Information is still coming in,
but a black hole

07:41.765 --> 07:44.594
has been detected
in Waxahachie, Texas.

07:44.638 --> 07:45.856
Oh, my Lord.

07:45.900 --> 07:47.467
Sources report it was caused

07:47.510 --> 07:49.686
by the supercollider.

07:49.730 --> 07:52.341
The black hole is growing
exponentially

07:52.384 --> 07:55.692
across Texas, destroying
everything in its path.

07:55.736 --> 07:58.129
This is an emergency situation.

07:58.173 --> 08:01.698
Repeat, this is
an emergency situat--

08:01.742 --> 08:03.787
John, what do we do?

08:03.831 --> 08:06.050
There's nothing we can do.

08:06.094 --> 08:08.313
He's right. It's going to
create a gravitational field

08:08.357 --> 08:09.880
that'll consume
everything around it.

08:09.924 --> 08:11.142
Should we evacuate?

08:11.186 --> 08:13.275
We can't. We could
never outrun it.

08:13.318 --> 08:14.798
Well, how much
time do we have?

08:14.842 --> 08:16.713
Minutes, at best.

08:16.757 --> 08:19.411
[electricity crackling]

08:19.455 --> 08:21.718
Daddy, I'm scared.It's okay, baby.

08:21.762 --> 08:23.198
We need to pray right now.

08:23.241 --> 08:25.069
You do that. I'm having a beer.

08:25.113 --> 08:27.158
Oh, everybody hold hands.

08:27.202 --> 08:28.682
Heavenly Father, watch over us--

08:28.725 --> 08:30.727
I don't want to spend my last
moments on Earth praying.

08:30.771 --> 08:33.425
Yeah, if we only got
a few minutes left,

08:33.469 --> 08:35.253
I want to spend it
talking to y'all.

08:35.297 --> 08:37.865
You are all the light
of my life.

08:37.908 --> 08:39.997
And I love you so much.

08:40.041 --> 08:41.912
[crashing outside]

08:42.304 --> 08:44.524
Daddy.Oh, I got you.

08:44.567 --> 08:46.134
I'm not letting go.

08:46.177 --> 08:47.962
I never said it enough,
but I love y'all.

08:48.005 --> 08:49.790
Kids,

08:49.833 --> 08:52.096
you have made me
a very proud father.

08:52.140 --> 08:53.228
I'm not ready.

08:53.271 --> 08:54.621
There are so many things
I want to do.

08:54.664 --> 08:56.623
Well, you better
pick one right now.

08:56.666 --> 08:59.887
[panting]
O-Okay, um...

09:01.802 --> 09:04.500
And I just want to say I'm sorry
for any time I was bad

09:04.544 --> 09:06.546
and any time I was mean
to Sheldon.

09:06.589 --> 09:07.808
It's okay.

09:07.851 --> 09:10.941
It's just so funny
when he's upset.

09:10.985 --> 09:13.422
But I'm still sorry about it.

09:13.465 --> 09:15.032
I'm sorry, too.

09:15.076 --> 09:16.512
Dad,

09:16.556 --> 09:18.253
I've been awful,
especially to you.

09:18.296 --> 09:19.776
No, you haven't.
I have.

09:19.820 --> 09:21.561
Well, we're good.

09:23.214 --> 09:25.434
Okay, we are done talking.
I love you all,

09:25.477 --> 09:27.175
but it is really time to pray.

09:28.742 --> 09:30.831
ALL:
Our Father, who art in heaven,

09:30.874 --> 09:32.397
hallowed be thy name.

09:32.441 --> 09:33.834
Thy kingdom come,

09:33.877 --> 09:37.098
thy will be done
on Earth as it is in heaven.

09:38.665 --> 09:41.363
Is that really what would happen
if there was a black hole?

09:41.406 --> 09:42.930
One of the possibilities.

09:42.973 --> 09:44.932
Are they all such a bummer?

09:44.975 --> 09:46.455
Not necessarily.
There's a theory

09:46.498 --> 09:48.544
that an event like that
could open a wormhole

09:48.588 --> 09:50.111
into an alternate universe.

09:50.154 --> 09:52.243
So what goes on
in an alternate universe?

09:52.287 --> 09:54.245
Anything, really.
It could be slightly different

09:54.289 --> 09:56.421
from this one
or the complete opposite.

09:56.465 --> 09:57.466
That's true.

09:57.509 --> 09:58.859
So if a black hole transports us

09:58.902 --> 10:02.210
to an alternate universe,
w-would we even know it?

10:02.253 --> 10:03.646
STURGIS:
Probably not.

10:03.690 --> 10:05.648
[Southern accent]:
To us, it'd be as normal

10:05.692 --> 10:07.868
as boots on a cowboy.

10:07.911 --> 10:10.740
That is wild.

10:10.784 --> 10:12.133
Dr. Sturgis is correct.

10:12.176 --> 10:14.875
If indeed we grew up
in another universe,

10:14.918 --> 10:17.660
our sense of normality would be
formed by that universe.

10:17.704 --> 10:19.488
That's enough.
There are no other universes.

10:19.531 --> 10:21.359
The Bible tells us
God created the Earth,

10:21.403 --> 10:23.448
not the Earths.

10:23.492 --> 10:25.973
Ugh, why did I have
to marry a preacher?

10:26.016 --> 10:29.106
Because it was God's will
to bless us with union.

10:29.150 --> 10:31.892
I hope it's his plan
that I hit the clubs tonight,

10:31.935 --> 10:34.677
'cause that's gonna happen.
[laughs]

10:34.721 --> 10:37.462
Why am I the only normal one
in this family?

10:37.506 --> 10:39.769
If you're the only normal one,
statistically speaking,

10:39.813 --> 10:41.162
you're abnormal.

10:41.205 --> 10:43.164
[chuckles] Freak.

10:43.207 --> 10:45.862
Stop picking on him.
You're gonna give him a complex

10:45.906 --> 10:47.298
and he'll end up in therapy.

10:47.342 --> 10:49.997
You New Yorkers
and your therapy.

10:50.040 --> 10:51.433
The only therapy I ever got

10:51.476 --> 10:54.305
was on my backside
from Pappy's belt.

10:54.349 --> 10:57.874
Oh, spanking. That's hot.

10:57.918 --> 10:59.615
I think you should
all be in therapy.

10:59.659 --> 11:02.052
All the answers I need
are right here.

11:02.096 --> 11:04.315
Hey, I know what'll
make this family happy.

11:04.359 --> 11:05.621
A puppy.

11:05.665 --> 11:08.711
Animals are excellent
for emotional support.

11:08.755 --> 11:11.366
The only thing I need
for emotional support

11:11.409 --> 11:16.240
is a warm shotgun
and a cold beer.

11:16.284 --> 11:18.025
This guy knows how to party.

11:18.068 --> 11:22.377
You seem to be interested in
this alternative universe thing.

11:22.420 --> 11:24.422
Maybe that's something
you could work on.

11:24.466 --> 11:25.946
[regular accent]:
Maybe there's another universe

11:25.989 --> 11:27.643
where I'm already doing that.

11:27.687 --> 11:31.473
Sure, but maybe
you could do it in both.

11:31.516 --> 11:33.736
[chuckles]
What are you getting at?

11:33.780 --> 11:37.479
Just that instead of wasting
your time bagging groceries,

11:37.522 --> 11:40.221
you could be working
on something worthwhile.

11:40.264 --> 11:44.268
There's nothing wrong with me
trying something new.

11:44.312 --> 11:46.357
But you've got a PhD.

11:46.401 --> 11:48.577
You're the smartest person here.

11:48.620 --> 11:49.186
Well...

11:49.230 --> 11:50.622
Connie, I'm happy

11:50.666 --> 11:52.494
doing what I'm doing right now.

11:52.537 --> 11:54.061
I don't believe that.

11:54.104 --> 11:56.672
Excuse me. You know more

11:56.716 --> 11:59.457
about how I should
live my life than I do?

11:59.501 --> 12:01.372
Yeah, maybe.

12:01.416 --> 12:04.158
May I speak with you outside?

12:05.594 --> 12:07.857
John, I'm sorry,
I don't mean to push,

12:07.901 --> 12:10.468
but I just, I worry about you.

12:10.512 --> 12:12.079
You do?

12:12.122 --> 12:13.210
Of course.

12:13.254 --> 12:15.778
You know I care about you.

12:15.822 --> 12:18.215
That means a lot.

12:19.260 --> 12:21.610
The truth is,

12:21.653 --> 12:24.221
if I could live
in an alternate universe,

12:24.265 --> 12:27.747
I'd live in one
where we never broke up.

12:28.704 --> 12:30.662
Hope it's okay to say that.

12:32.360 --> 12:34.754
It is.

12:34.797 --> 12:37.191
Because I wish it, too.

12:37.234 --> 12:38.932
Oh, Connie.

12:38.975 --> 12:40.629
Oh, John.

12:44.154 --> 12:45.503
John?

12:46.983 --> 12:48.768
John?
Huh?

12:48.811 --> 12:50.552
If you could live
in an alternate universe,

12:50.595 --> 12:52.249
what would it be?

12:53.294 --> 12:56.340
Oh, I haven't really
given it any thought.

13:04.696 --> 13:06.307
Another theory
of black holes

13:06.350 --> 13:08.526
involves Hawking
radiation.

13:08.570 --> 13:11.051
Right. Near the event horizon,

13:11.094 --> 13:13.531
virtual particles
are being created.

13:13.575 --> 13:15.490
Actually, twin
virtual particles.

13:15.533 --> 13:18.406
Wait, what's an "event horizon"?

13:18.449 --> 13:19.711
It just means the edge.

13:19.755 --> 13:21.191
Why not say "the edge"?

13:21.235 --> 13:23.933
The guitar player for U2
is called the Edge.

13:23.977 --> 13:26.544
What does that have
to do with anything?

13:26.588 --> 13:28.546
I'm participating
in the conversation.

13:28.590 --> 13:30.331
You're just sitting there
like a lump.

13:30.374 --> 13:31.985
[chuckles]
"Lump."

13:32.028 --> 13:34.248
Anyway, ordinarily,
the particles would collide

13:34.291 --> 13:35.815
and destroy each other.

13:35.858 --> 13:39.557
But in this instance,
they could exist simultaneously.

13:39.601 --> 13:42.560
And what is the significance
of that?

13:42.604 --> 13:44.345
I can participate, smart-ass.

13:44.388 --> 13:45.737
Good job, lump.

13:45.781 --> 13:47.565
SHELDON:One interpretation
would be,

13:47.609 --> 13:49.306
if I was standing
at the event horizon,

13:49.350 --> 13:51.743
I could interact
with my own twin.

13:51.787 --> 13:54.181
I've interacted with you.
It's not great.

13:54.224 --> 13:57.532
I think if there were two of me,
we'd be unstoppable.

13:58.359 --> 14:01.275
So, if we add
the information entropy,

14:01.318 --> 14:02.885
we'll get the result
we're looking for.

14:02.929 --> 14:03.930
That's brilliant.

Hmm. We'll call it

Perfect.
Wait, which Cooper comes first?

14:16.594 --> 14:18.118
