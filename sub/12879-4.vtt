think Geography is boring--

08:11.991 --> 08:12.909
They're right--

08:12.992 --> 08:14.202

remember things!

08:16.704 --> 08:19.165
We should probably start
at the beginning--

08:19.248 --> 08:21.042
Just skip the song
and dance, friend.

08:21.125 --> 08:22.960

bullet points.

is a dance.

hate Geography.

An is for Asia,

Apple is for Africa,

That's never a
good idea.

16:39.289 --> 16:43.460
Back home I'm Winston Percival
Althazar: botanist's son.

16:43.544 --> 16:45.546
But when I return home
from wizardry school,

16:45.629 --> 16:50.050
I will be Winston
Percival Althazar: hero.

16:50.134 --> 16:52.594
Do the Others back home
give you a hard time?

16:52.678 --> 16:55.097
They steal my lunch,
lock me in closets,

16:55.180 --> 16:56.932
and call me
Loser-ston.

16:57.015 --> 16:58.475
They're dullards.

16:58.559 --> 17:00.978
Because if you think of
it, for the name Loser-ston

17:01.061 --> 17:03.939
to be correct, my actual name
would have to be Winnerston.

17:04.021 --> 17:07.108
But it's, Winston, Winston
Percival Althazar.

17:07.192 --> 17:11.113
You're doing our family a
great service by being here.

17:11.195 --> 17:13.323
So I think
I can help.

17:13.406 --> 17:14.282
Come on.

17:19.829 --> 17:21.665
Hey, how you
holding up?

17:21.749 --> 17:22.958
I've been better.

17:23.040 --> 17:26.252
I haven't been in this big a jam
since I fell in the jam barrel

17:26.336 --> 17:27.503
at the Honeysuckle
Jam Festival.

17:27.588 --> 17:29.798
I feel bad I got you
in trouble though.

17:29.882 --> 17:31.008
Good.

17:31.091 --> 17:32.509
It'll take years to get over
being traumatically smoothied.

17:32.593 --> 17:33.802
Give her a
break, Hailey.

17:33.886 --> 17:35.345
You look good
in smoothie.

17:35.429 --> 17:36.805
Orange is
your color.

17:36.889 --> 17:37.639
Thank you.

17:37.723 --> 17:38.557
Now listen up.

17:38.640 --> 17:40.142
I'm thinking about
going over the wall.

17:40.225 --> 17:41.018
You in?

17:41.101 --> 17:43.103
I keep telling you
we're not in jail.

17:43.187 --> 17:45.314
Besides, there's
no wall to go over.

17:45.397 --> 17:47.775
I can't take
it anymore!

17:47.858 --> 17:50.360
Let me out,
let me out!

17:52.279 --> 17:53.947
Take it easy, kid.

17:54.031 --> 17:54.865
I'll be your
snitch.

17:54.948 --> 17:57.451
I'll tell you everything
you need to know.

17:57.534 --> 17:59.495
We'll leave them
here for good.

17:59.870 --> 18:00.871
Your dad's here.

18:05.709 --> 18:06.835
How did this
even happen?!

18:06.919 --> 18:08.337
You were supposed
to be studying.

18:08.420 --> 18:09.379
Dad, I can
explain--

18:09.463 --> 18:11.840
Save it. I am very
disappointed in both of you.

18:11.924 --> 18:13.634
Mr. Quince, it
wasn't his fault.

18:13.717 --> 18:15.844
He tried to help me,
but I snuck out.

18:15.928 --> 18:17.846
And even he still
came to find me.

18:17.930 --> 18:19.640
All of this is
because of me.

18:19.723 --> 18:20.432
See, I told you!

18:20.516 --> 18:22.351
It's all her
fault we're in jail.

18:22.434 --> 18:23.852
It's not jail!

18:23.936 --> 18:26.188
Well at least you
owned up to it, Astral.

18:26.271 --> 18:27.648
Let's go.

18:27.731 --> 18:29.483
Until I can think
of something else,

18:29.566 --> 18:31.151
studying Geography
all night seems

18:31.235 --> 18:32.694
like a suitable
punishment.

18:32.778 --> 18:33.153
Ugh.

18:33.237 --> 18:34.112
That's for sure.

18:34.196 --> 18:35.864
I know emotions are
running high right now,

18:35.948 --> 18:37.991
but let's not make
Geography the scapegoat.

18:38.075 --> 18:40.327
{\an9}<i>♪</i>

18:40.410 --> 18:43.372
The thing about the continents
is that they're always shifting.

18:43.455 --> 18:44.665
Just like people.

18:45.791 --> 18:47.543
Continental drift--

18:47.626 --> 18:51.171
Sometimes that creates
friction, and that's bad.

18:51.255 --> 18:53.006
She took
my drink!

18:53.090 --> 18:54.550
Woah.

18:55.801 --> 19:00.389
But sometimes, when things come
together in just the right way,

19:00.472 --> 19:02.891
it creates
something special.

19:02.975 --> 19:04.893
Hey, how you
holding up?

19:04.977 --> 19:07.020
I feel bad I got
you in trouble.

19:07.104 --> 19:08.480
And the best
part is,

19:08.564 --> 19:10.440
is that you never know
what's gonna happen.

19:10.524 --> 19:13.235
(tablet ringing)

19:13.318 --> 19:16.071
Princess, get your head
out of the clouds, okay.

19:16.154 --> 19:17.739
Your test is
tomorrow.

19:17.823 --> 19:21.034
Now let's go over your
mnemonic devices again.

19:21.118 --> 19:25.747
(tablet ringing)

19:25.831 --> 19:27.082
Tristan!

19:27.165 --> 19:29.084
Hey Astral,
what's up?

19:29.167 --> 19:31.628
My geography
grade, hopefully.

19:31.712 --> 19:32.588
I'm just
studying.

19:32.671 --> 19:36.758
Listen, I weirdly had
a good time tonight.

19:36.842 --> 19:37.593
Really?

19:37.676 --> 19:39.678
I was wondering, since
it's still early

19:39.761 --> 19:41.430
and my curfew's
not for a while.

19:41.513 --> 19:44.433
Do you wanna
hang out?

19:52.524 --> 19:53.734
Oh, there
you are!

19:53.817 --> 19:55.569
I've been
looking for you.

19:55.652 --> 19:57.571
It's time for your
next dingbat lesson.

19:57.654 --> 19:59.615
Stand right there.

19:59.698 --> 20:03.327
Put this apple
on your head.

20:03.410 --> 20:05.078
No actually,
it's okay!

20:05.162 --> 20:06.413
I figured it out.

20:06.496 --> 20:07.539
Figured
out what?

20:07.623 --> 20:08.165
Spells.

20:08.248 --> 20:09.541
The whole
magic thing.

20:09.625 --> 20:10.792
Don't get ahead
of yourself.

20:10.876 --> 20:12.085
Magic takes time
and skill--

20:12.169 --> 20:13.128
Oh, no, no, no.

20:13.211 --> 20:13.962
Trust me,
Brendoni!

20:14.046 --> 20:15.797
Watch this.

20:16.214 --> 20:20.969
Deep concentration,
here I go.

20:21.053 --> 20:23.931
Vronti astrapi!

20:24.014 --> 20:27.684
Ow! Ow! Ow!

20:27.768 --> 20:28.810
I did it!

20:28.894 --> 20:30.103
I did it!!

20:30.187 --> 20:31.521
Jolly good!

20:31.605 --> 20:33.440

happened?

{\an1}I kept calling plate
tectonics "plate tristonics."

20:43.700 --> 20:45.160
How'd you do
on the test?

20:45.243 --> 20:46.662
I don't know,
I can't look.

20:46.745 --> 20:48.372
I'm too nervous
to look.

20:48.455 --> 20:49.581
{\an3}You look.

20:50.749 --> 20:51.959
You got a D+.

20:52.042 --> 20:53.168
A D plus what?

20:53.251 --> 20:54.252
That's the grade.

20:54.336 --> 20:56.463
Don't worry, I got some
flash cards in my locker.

20:56.546 --> 20:59.299
We can get a head
start on the next test.

21:00.926 --> 21:02.344
Grades are so
different here.

21:02.427 --> 21:04.304
In Athenia the best
grades are flowers.

21:04.388 --> 21:07.140
Then leaves, then
twigs, then rocks.

21:07.224 --> 21:08.809
That's is
so cool.

21:08.892 --> 21:11.144
All these times I flew
threw through these halls

21:11.228 --> 21:12.896

finally here!

21:12.980 --> 21:14.481

high school!

21:18.652 --> 21:22.864
Are you floating?

21:22.948 --> 21:24.992
I get so emotional
when I feel things,

21:25.075 --> 21:27.869
I can hardly
keep it inside.
