WEBVTT

00:29.654 --> 00:30.989
Wake up!

00:31.823 --> 00:33.450
This is no place to sleep.

01:01.019 --> 01:03.354
Step back, you reek.

01:03.438 --> 01:06.441
If you want me to read you
the letter, step back.

01:22.207 --> 01:23.666
It's from your old lady.

01:24.751 --> 01:27.378
She says she really loves you.

01:29.130 --> 01:32.342
But she has needs,
and the wait is long.

01:32.425 --> 01:35.220
So she's already fucking
some other asshole.

01:40.475 --> 01:42.143
That's life, Chapo.

02:10.630 --> 02:14.884
I feel the warmth
from my boiling blood

02:14.968 --> 02:19.389
I feel the fear sweat dripping away

02:19.472 --> 02:23.977
There's a stillness
that nothing transmits

02:24.060 --> 02:29.274
I'm a breeze that grows stronger

02:30.692 --> 02:33.611
Even when the clouds drift away

02:34.904 --> 02:38.950
Even when my skin dries away

02:39.033 --> 02:43.413
I'll be back someday

02:43.496 --> 02:47.876
To unleash my return

02:52.547 --> 02:56.801
I have the dust
that protects the road

02:56.885 --> 03:00.847
I have the branches
of a leafless tree

03:00.930 --> 03:05.101
I'm the one guarding over
the tired night

03:05.184 --> 03:10.899
There are silhouettes
that come to see me

03:11.900 --> 03:15.028
Even when clouds drift away

03:16.446 --> 03:20.116
Even when my skin dries away

03:20.199 --> 03:24.996
I'll be back someday

03:25.079 --> 03:29.292
To unleash my return

03:36.049 --> 03:38.301
Let me go!
Where are you taking me?

03:38.384 --> 03:39.719
Wait!

04:07.497 --> 04:09.791
I'm the Deputy Director of this prison.

04:11.292 --> 04:14.671
You've spent a month in isolation
because I gave the order.

04:16.673 --> 04:19.425
I'll decide whether you stay
in there or not.

04:19.509 --> 04:22.053
Let me ask you just one question.

04:23.221 --> 04:26.224
Do you promise to live
a different life?

04:26.307 --> 04:29.352
Do you agree that so much luxury,
money, and power was a mistake?

04:31.354 --> 04:34.190
You can look me in the eyes
to answer me.

04:43.825 --> 04:45.576
Yes, Deputy Director.

04:46.786 --> 04:48.663
I promise I've changed.

05:04.762 --> 05:06.389
Take him back, one more month.

05:06.472 --> 05:08.308
Wait, ma'am!

05:11.019 --> 05:12.270
I'll take revenge!

05:12.353 --> 05:14.147
Be harsher with your discipline.

05:14.230 --> 05:16.899
Make it clear to him
that he's in Almoloya.

05:16.983 --> 05:19.110
No, no!

05:19.193 --> 05:20.820
No!

06:49.200 --> 06:51.327
No, no, no! No!

06:54.038 --> 06:55.540
Turn it off!

06:59.210 --> 07:01.337
Turn it off!

07:09.387 --> 07:11.472
I have a stomachache.

07:13.224 --> 07:14.934
I have a stomachache!

07:31.868 --> 07:33.327
I have a stomachache.

07:35.830 --> 07:37.874
I have a stomachache!

07:39.750 --> 07:41.294
Hey--

08:08.738 --> 08:10.490
Deputy Director.

08:10.573 --> 08:12.700
El Chapo has not been eating
for several days

08:12.783 --> 08:14.911
and he says he has a stomachache.

08:29.008 --> 08:30.885
Take that off and take a shower.

08:30.968 --> 08:32.970
I left you a clean uniform.

09:24.689 --> 09:26.357
Lay down on your back.

10:12.403 --> 10:14.989
If you tell them it's serious,
I'll pay you a shitload of money.

10:15.072 --> 10:18.326
-I can pay you a lot.
-How much?

10:18.409 --> 10:20.745
You set the price.

10:22.079 --> 10:25.041
You just have to convince them
to take me back to my cell.

10:25.124 --> 10:27.793
The pain will go away if you eat.

10:27.877 --> 10:29.295
Do me the favor, doc.

10:31.047 --> 10:32.465
All right.

10:56.364 --> 10:57.948
No!

11:12.213 --> 11:13.756
A message from the Deputy Director.

11:14.799 --> 11:17.093
For trying to bribe the doctor,

11:17.176 --> 11:19.303
you've just won yourself
two more months in here, asshole.

11:20.012 --> 11:21.514
No, please, no!

11:21.597 --> 11:23.349
No! I'll do whatever you want!

11:23.432 --> 11:25.476
Take me out of here!

11:25.559 --> 11:27.895
Deputy Director, I swear I've changed!

11:27.978 --> 11:30.189
Deputy Director!

11:33.025 --> 11:34.568
Deputy Director!

11:34.652 --> 11:37.279
I swear I won't live like I used to.

11:38.739 --> 11:40.533
Deputy Director!

11:42.076 --> 11:44.745
Keep pressuring Mr. Guzmán.

11:44.829 --> 11:47.873
I want to know everything
he says or does.

11:47.957 --> 11:49.625
Understood.

13:24.345 --> 13:26.555
Give me what's in your pockets.

13:28.766 --> 13:30.518
I don't have anything.

13:35.356 --> 13:36.774
No.

13:41.695 --> 13:43.239
It's just a thread.

13:53.582 --> 13:55.960
Do you think you are
the first one to try this?

13:57.127 --> 13:59.964
You're counting the days
to see when you're out, right?

14:00.839 --> 14:02.675
You just have to ask me.

14:03.509 --> 14:04.718
Chapo...

14:04.802 --> 14:06.762
you'll never leave
this place, son of a bitch.

14:17.189 --> 14:20.860
Deputy Director, Joaquín Guzmán
has once again attacked

14:20.943 --> 14:22.444
the authorities of this prison.

16:43.377 --> 16:46.797
Very good, Chapo.
Take good care of your plants.

16:46.880 --> 16:48.799
Mr. Pedro will need more opium gum.

16:48.882 --> 16:50.134
Of course.

16:50.217 --> 16:52.970
I think these will do
for two more harvests.

17:11.488 --> 17:12.698
Thank you.

17:16.952 --> 17:19.288
You're better at this than your dad.

17:47.107 --> 17:48.484
Mom.

17:54.990 --> 17:57.493
I'll get the same or more
with the other two harvests.

17:59.411 --> 18:01.121
Great, my son.

18:01.705 --> 18:03.457
Go hide it.

19:12.818 --> 19:14.027
What's up?

19:37.217 --> 19:38.760
What?

19:38.844 --> 19:41.430
You thought I wouldn't find out
about the money from the harvest?

19:41.513 --> 19:44.558
I earned it. It's mine, not yours.

19:44.641 --> 19:47.769
Who taught you how to farm it,
you ungrateful punk!

20:21.678 --> 20:22.971
Joaquín.

20:24.640 --> 20:26.058
Joaquín.

20:31.563 --> 20:33.607
Son, go and get your father.

20:33.690 --> 20:35.275
Come on.

22:25.677 --> 22:28.305
Bye.

22:28.388 --> 22:32.225
TAURO HARDWARE STORE

25:07.214 --> 25:08.673
Hey!

25:11.760 --> 25:14.304
Hey! Get away from the car.

25:15.597 --> 25:19.517
This car needs to be
properly cleaned and waxed.

25:19.601 --> 25:21.019
I can do it.

25:21.603 --> 25:22.604
How much?

25:22.687 --> 25:24.147
You can name the price.

25:26.399 --> 25:28.109
I can even clean the interior.

25:31.238 --> 25:32.948
There's some buckets and water there.

25:36.034 --> 25:37.410
Come on!

25:37.494 --> 25:38.703
Okay.

27:06.291 --> 27:08.460
Son of a bitch!

27:11.880 --> 27:14.466
Come on, Pancho! Get in!

28:03.681 --> 28:04.974
Get out, son of a bitch!

28:05.975 --> 28:07.185
Get out of the car!

28:08.395 --> 28:09.771
Get out!

28:10.688 --> 28:12.440
Come on! Pancho, get in the car!

28:33.336 --> 28:35.213
Come on, punk!

28:36.798 --> 28:39.342
Did you want to steal
my car, fucking punk?

28:40.635 --> 28:41.636
No, sir.

28:42.679 --> 28:44.013
I only wanted to go for a ride

28:44.097 --> 28:45.974
and see how it felt
to drive such a car.

28:46.057 --> 28:48.226
I wouldn't steal from you, Mr. Pedro.

28:48.309 --> 28:50.478
I want to have that same car.

28:50.562 --> 28:52.480
That's why I want to work for you.

28:52.564 --> 28:56.025
You go for a ride in my car,
and now you're asking for work?

28:56.109 --> 28:57.360
Yes.

28:57.444 --> 28:58.486
What's your name?

28:58.570 --> 29:00.238
Joaquín Guzmán.

29:01.990 --> 29:04.242
But everybody calls me El Chapo.

29:04.325 --> 29:06.661
You're the one who is taking
good care of the poppy field?

29:06.745 --> 29:08.997
-That's right.
-Then you're already working for me.

29:09.080 --> 29:09.998
No, Don Pedro,

29:10.081 --> 29:13.793
I can do much more
than just taking care of the fields.

29:16.171 --> 29:17.797
I want to do more.

29:17.881 --> 29:20.633
If you want to join me,
you've got to earn it.

29:20.717 --> 29:21.885
Tell me what to do.

29:21.968 --> 29:23.928
What do I have to do
to earn myself a place?

29:34.481 --> 29:37.484
There's someone
who is stealing money from me.

29:38.860 --> 29:41.029
I can't stand those things.

29:42.071 --> 29:43.364
I want you to kill him.

30:11.476 --> 30:13.645
I bet he won't do it.

30:15.480 --> 30:16.815
I bet he will.

30:27.617 --> 30:29.327
Have you used one before?

30:43.049 --> 30:45.677
You're going to lose the bet, buddy.

30:47.345 --> 30:48.346
Get out.

30:50.014 --> 30:51.099
Damn!

31:43.818 --> 31:45.320
Chapo, what's up?

31:55.246 --> 31:56.915
What are you doing?

32:33.660 --> 32:37.163
Damn it!
You did better than I thought.

32:37.246 --> 32:38.998
You killed him!

33:43.354 --> 33:44.689
Come here.

33:47.191 --> 33:48.526
Boss.

34:13.634 --> 34:15.261
Welcome to my organization.

34:16.554 --> 34:18.431
Tomorrow we'll go to Culiacán.

34:18.514 --> 34:21.017
-You're coming with me.
-Thank you, Don Pedro.

34:24.979 --> 34:26.481
Now go and have some fun.

34:26.564 --> 34:28.357
Enjoy the party.

34:35.990 --> 34:37.700
Hold this.

34:38.951 --> 34:40.369
Take this.

34:53.841 --> 34:55.635
The guys at the back,

34:55.718 --> 34:59.847
the ones all dressed up,
are the DEA guys.

35:04.602 --> 35:08.481
The guys standing over there
are the politicians.

35:10.775 --> 35:12.568
Be careful with them.

35:13.694 --> 35:15.738
They're the real assholes.

35:16.239 --> 35:19.700
Those guys are the military men.

35:19.784 --> 35:22.453
They take care of the fields
and watch our backs.

35:23.538 --> 35:25.164
No crooked games with them.

36:28.519 --> 36:30.563
-Your package, boss.
-Let me see.

36:31.689 --> 36:33.357
That's it!

36:36.569 --> 36:39.780
Look! Fresh from the ocean,
just as we like it!

36:39.864 --> 36:42.658
For all of you to eat!

36:42.742 --> 36:44.243
Long live Don Pedro!

36:44.327 --> 36:46.120
Yeah!

36:55.379 --> 36:57.340
More tequila.

37:00.801 --> 37:02.887
-Hurray!
-Hurray!

37:41.550 --> 37:45.846
I know that I'm out

37:45.930 --> 37:48.432
But the day I die

37:48.516 --> 37:51.102
I know you'll be crying

37:51.185 --> 37:53.604
Crying and crying

37:53.813 --> 37:56.816
Crying and crying

37:56.899 --> 37:59.318
You'll say you never loved me

37:59.402 --> 38:01.904
But you're going to be really sad

38:01.988 --> 38:05.032
And sad you're going to stay

38:07.034 --> 38:10.579
With or without money

38:10.663 --> 38:14.500
I always do what I want

38:15.334 --> 38:19.839
And what I say goes

38:20.923 --> 38:24.552
I have no throne or queen

38:24.635 --> 38:28.264
Nobody understands me

38:28.347 --> 38:32.184
But I still remain the king

38:33.227 --> 38:35.104
Long live Mexico, assholes!

38:35.187 --> 38:38.190
Long live Mexico!

38:38.274 --> 38:39.942
When you have money...

38:41.527 --> 38:42.862
you have power.

38:45.489 --> 38:47.158
When you have power...

38:48.284 --> 38:50.244
everybody wants to be with you.

39:01.172 --> 39:05.176
Your mom says you're going to work
for Pedro Avilés in Culiacán.

39:05.259 --> 39:07.762
Don't pack,
you're not going anywhere.

39:34.747 --> 39:35.998
Go!

39:39.126 --> 39:40.169
Leave!

39:41.504 --> 39:44.131
You're just going to be
one more servant to a drug lord.

39:44.215 --> 39:45.591
Just a fucking servant.

39:48.552 --> 39:50.971
I'm going to have more power
than anybody else.

39:51.847 --> 39:54.266
I'm going to become
the most powerful drug lord.

39:57.812 --> 39:59.355
Did you get that?

39:59.438 --> 40:01.232
I can swear on that!

41:19.477 --> 41:21.437
Four months locked up.

41:25.691 --> 41:28.152
Surely that was enough.

41:29.862 --> 41:32.448
You've behaved.

41:38.662 --> 41:41.999
Do you promise to live
a different life?

41:42.082 --> 41:45.711
Do you agree that so much luxury,
money, and power was a mistake?

41:55.304 --> 41:56.931
Yes.

42:03.521 --> 42:05.189
Take him to his cell.

42:53.529 --> 42:55.322
Chapo.

42:57.366 --> 42:58.701
Chapo.

43:00.995 --> 43:03.247
We thought you were dead.

43:11.630 --> 43:14.133
Wake up! You're not on vacation!

44:40.886 --> 44:43.347
Rubén was never himself again.

44:46.433 --> 44:48.602
They took him to a special area.

45:00.989 --> 45:02.616
Chapo.

45:04.660 --> 45:06.370
What'd they do to you?

45:11.917 --> 45:15.003
They kept you all these months
in isolation?

45:18.298 --> 45:19.842
Silence!

45:25.639 --> 45:26.807
Enrique.

45:26.890 --> 45:28.642
Contreras Vidal.

45:31.562 --> 45:32.771
Joaquín.

45:32.855 --> 45:34.565
Guzmán Loera.

45:34.648 --> 45:36.525
Permission to speak, sir.

45:41.405 --> 45:42.656
Speak.

45:44.783 --> 45:46.326
Sir.

45:46.410 --> 45:49.246
Is it true that there is
community work in the prison?

45:49.329 --> 45:51.874
I'd like to work. Anything is fine.

45:51.957 --> 45:55.502
I tell the Deputy Director
who deserves to work and who doesn't.

45:56.336 --> 45:58.213
Believe it or not, it's like a prize.

45:58.297 --> 45:59.715
Yes, sir.

46:08.015 --> 46:09.308
Adrián.

46:09.391 --> 46:11.018
Velázquez Saavedra.

46:59.650 --> 47:01.777
Where should I put the bags?

47:01.860 --> 47:03.862
Container in the backyard.

47:29.805 --> 47:31.056
Joaquín.

47:31.139 --> 47:32.933
I came every two weeks.

47:33.016 --> 47:35.477
They didn't let me see you.

47:35.561 --> 47:37.521
I filed defense statements,

47:37.604 --> 47:40.023
but it was useless.

47:40.107 --> 47:43.151
Don't worry. I'm fine now.

47:44.152 --> 47:45.904
Better than before.

47:56.248 --> 47:58.458
-Hello.
-Buddy.

47:58.542 --> 48:00.752
What's up, buddy?
How are they treating you?

48:01.628 --> 48:04.590
Do you remember the party
we had for Mr. Palomino?

48:04.673 --> 48:06.633
Yes, of course I remember.

48:06.717 --> 48:09.052
Could you please organize
a similar party?

48:09.136 --> 48:11.388
This time is for Lora's wife.

48:11.471 --> 48:15.684
She's a nice girl and she's
been helping him out a lot.

48:17.519 --> 48:19.646
Please, help me with that.

48:34.870 --> 48:36.371
That's him.

49:02.564 --> 49:04.441
I won't hurt you, buddy.

49:04.524 --> 49:06.526
On the contrary...

49:07.778 --> 49:10.489
I'll reward you if you do as I say.

49:51.321 --> 49:53.156
I'm going to escape.

49:54.866 --> 49:58.370
Joaquín, unless they transfer you
to another prison...

49:59.204 --> 50:01.498
escaping is impossible.

50:01.581 --> 50:05.460
I'm going to escape using the trucks
that enter though the back gate.

50:06.461 --> 50:08.255
We need a false floor in the truck.

50:08.338 --> 50:10.090
And we need to bribe the driver,

50:10.173 --> 50:12.134
the loaders, and the guards.

50:12.217 --> 50:14.678
Ask Ismael for the money.

50:14.761 --> 50:17.681
Joaquín, this is crazy.

50:20.308 --> 50:24.771
I don't care how long it takes me,
I'm going to be free again.

50:37.826 --> 50:40.704
C5, keep I3 in red.

50:40.787 --> 50:42.664
Message received.

50:47.919 --> 50:49.921
Are you going to open the door?

51:00.056 --> 51:01.308
Bring him.

51:18.909 --> 51:22.579
I'm going to escape using the trucks
that enter though the back gate.

51:22.662 --> 51:24.080
We need a false floor in the truck.

51:24.164 --> 51:25.624
And we need to bribe the driver,

51:25.707 --> 51:27.334
the loaders, and the guards.

51:27.417 --> 51:28.752
Ask Ismael for the money.

51:33.256 --> 51:36.927
You're very naive
if you think I trust people.

51:38.011 --> 51:40.555
Everything is being monitored, Mr. Guzmán.

51:42.182 --> 51:44.643
That's why nobody
can escape from Almoloya.

51:50.607 --> 51:52.234
Take him back to isolation.

51:58.031 --> 51:59.741
No!

52:25.684 --> 52:28.311
You may say you never loved me

52:28.395 --> 52:31.398
But you're going to be really sad

52:31.481 --> 52:33.817
And sad you're going to stay

52:37.028 --> 52:40.115
With or without money

52:41.241 --> 52:44.995
I always do what I want

52:46.288 --> 52:50.125
And what I say goes

52:51.334 --> 52:54.921
I have no throne or queen

52:56.047 --> 52:59.217
Nobody understands me

52:59.301 --> 53:03.847
But I still remain the king

53:55.357 --> 53:57.359
