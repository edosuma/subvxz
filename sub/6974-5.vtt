00:04.270 --> 00:09.037
Yeah, dudes. Welcome to your Dumb Ass
Show. l am your Sky Commander Winky.

00:09.142 --> 00:14.375
- And this is the beautiful Captain Dare.
- Yeah, baby.

00:14.481 --> 00:18.542
- The biggest dumb-ass l know.
- Thank you, Sky Commander.

00:18.651 --> 00:22.178
Captain Dare will show you
what a dumb-ass he really is.

00:22.288 --> 00:27.851
But be forewarned. Only a stupid dumb-ass
would neglect to take every safety precaution

00:27.961 --> 00:31.453
in the stunts you are about to witness.

00:31.531 --> 00:36.969
Now, the physics alone took
almost five minutes of calculation.

00:44.244 --> 00:46.974
Yeah, dude. Fire when ready.

00:48.681 --> 00:52.173
Oh, mother... What the...

00:53.887 --> 00:55.752
And that's a dumb-ass.

00:55.855 --> 00:58.551
Oh, right in the...

01:02.262 --> 01:06.596
Natalie, come here.
How about a kiss for good luck?

01:06.699 --> 01:10.533
- Bill, why are you doing this?
- His name's Captain Dare.

01:10.603 --> 01:16.599
And he'll be famous one day for
going where no dudes have gone before.

01:16.709 --> 01:21.908
lf you won't give me a kiss,
how about throwing me a magazine?

01:23.000 --> 01:29.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:47.540 --> 01:50.407
That is it.

01:50.477 --> 01:52.911
There it is.

01:52.979 --> 01:55.880
That is a dumb-ass.

01:57.383 --> 01:59.613
l'm the man.

02:00.987 --> 02:05.583
What up? Come here.
You want some dirt on you?

02:09.496 --> 02:13.796
And now the awesome Captain Dare
will make Dumb Ass history

02:13.900 --> 02:17.563
in the scientifically modified
shopping cart of doom.

02:17.637 --> 02:24.338
Rolling down this hill, hitting the launch
ramp at an estimated 24.6 miles an hour,

02:24.444 --> 02:28.073
sailing just over
the scrumptious Natalie Gordon,

02:28.148 --> 02:31.845
who will be holding
this flaming torch in her mouth.

02:31.951 --> 02:38.015
- l didn't say l was going to do anything.
- This is the money shot. Captain, tell her.

02:38.124 --> 02:40.786
What could go wrong?

02:40.860 --> 02:44.660
You mean besides landing on me
and crushing my head?

02:46.032 --> 02:50.594
lt'll be killer. The Captain will jump,
her torch will set the cart on fire.

02:50.670 --> 02:56.939
And our daring hero rolling on
to salvation in the pool of life, triumphant.

02:57.944 --> 03:01.937
Natalie, come on.
Just do it for me. Please?

03:15.695 --> 03:20.394
You're gonna freakin' fly, man.
This is gonna be big. You can do this.

03:20.500 --> 03:24.903
- You are the man. Show 'em, dumb-ass.
- l'm the man.

03:25.004 --> 03:29.168
l'm the man. Captain Dumb-Ass,
comin' down. What up.

03:41.554 --> 03:43.419
Bill!

03:44.157 --> 03:46.216
Now that's a dumb-ass.

03:47.227 --> 03:49.661
Come on, Bill, get up.

04:37.610 --> 04:40.977
- Thanks for coming so quickly.
- You the medical examiner?

04:41.080 --> 04:44.140
l'm Dr Fountain.
You're the experts from the FBl?

04:44.951 --> 04:49.251
- ''The experts?''
- l was told you were the experts.

04:49.322 --> 04:53.554
We work on the X-Files.
Our expertise is the unexplained.

04:53.626 --> 04:59.587
- We were told you had an unexplained death.
- You're the experts. You tell me.

05:02.335 --> 05:04.963
Why don't you explain what happened?

05:05.071 --> 05:07.801
Well, l can't. That's the point.

05:07.907 --> 05:12.571
- You can't tell us anything?
- l'd prefer not to go on record.

05:12.645 --> 05:16.638
- Why is that?
- The kid's parents are suing everyone.

05:16.749 --> 05:18.979
- For what?
- Everything.

05:19.085 --> 05:23.818
The county for making the street too steep,
the shop he stole the cart from,

05:23.923 --> 05:26.858
the company that made the helmet he wore.

05:38.638 --> 05:44.304
Off the record, what the hell has that
got to do with a supermarket shopping cart?

05:44.377 --> 05:48.609
- You familiar with The Dumb Ass Show?
- The Dumb Ass Show?

05:48.681 --> 05:51.878
A cable TV show where
kids act like dumb-asses.

05:51.984 --> 05:55.886
- They tape themselves doing stunts.
- This was an accident?

05:55.988 --> 05:59.856
l'd prefer not to get sucked
into a legal nightmare.

05:59.959 --> 06:05.556
You investigate the unexplained.
How about you explain it to me?

06:12.672 --> 06:15.869
Dr Fountain, do you see this?

06:20.012 --> 06:25.040
- What the hell is that?
- You're asking me?

06:46.172 --> 06:49.539
- Thanks for coming so quickly.
- You said ''urgent.''

06:49.609 --> 06:52.544
- What am l looking at?
- Maybe you can tell us.

06:52.612 --> 06:54.705
ls she the expert?

07:05.425 --> 07:07.893
What do you think?

07:08.394 --> 07:15.391
Well, l have to say that l have never
seen anything quite like this before.

07:24.577 --> 07:26.636
Something killed this kid.

07:26.746 --> 07:31.979
Judging from the amount of insect feces
in the ear and nasal cavities,

07:32.084 --> 07:38.114
they fed at such a furious rate that it caused
the boy's skull to collapse from the inside.

07:38.224 --> 07:45.426
His helmet protected his head during
the crash. There is no impact trauma here.

07:46.332 --> 07:49.267
You're saying flies killed him?

07:53.773 --> 07:59.905
Of all the kids at the scene,
flies choose to attack this boy. Why?

07:59.979 --> 08:03.346
Maybe they acted
for reasons we're not seeing.

08:03.449 --> 08:07.579
What if somebody put something
in his helmet? lnsect pheromone.

08:07.653 --> 08:14.252
Spanish Fly, that stuff you see advertised
in magazines that guys use to attract girls.

08:15.194 --> 08:17.321
l glance at 'em for amusement.

08:17.430 --> 08:23.665
l may have to brush up on my Spanish Fly,
but l don't think the science works that way.

08:23.769 --> 08:29.639
Before we look for an MO, l wanna find out
what kind of fly would act that aggressively.

08:29.709 --> 08:35.203
The musca vetustissima Walker,
the Australian bush fly.

08:35.313 --> 08:40.445
lt craves protein so much, it will crawl
into your nose, mouth, ears, even eyes,

08:40.520 --> 08:42.681
to feed on blood and moisture.

08:42.788 --> 08:47.885
The New Zealand screwworm fly
often kills its victims in mere moments

08:47.994 --> 08:51.987
by burrowing into an open wound or cut.

08:52.999 --> 08:56.992
l'm sorry. l'm Dr Rocky Bronzino.

08:57.069 --> 08:59.867
Hi. Rocky Bronzino.
Hello there. Rocky Bronzino.

08:59.972 --> 09:05.672
Field entomological expert,
Rutgers University, at your service.

09:06.245 --> 09:08.338
- Dr Bronzino...
- Rocky.

09:09.882 --> 09:13.374
Neither of these flies are
indigenous to America.

09:13.486 --> 09:16.353
Are you suggesting a virulent foreign vector?

09:16.422 --> 09:20.688
No. Your specimens
are your garden-variety calliphorid,

09:20.760 --> 09:23.354
harmless as, well, flies.

09:24.230 --> 09:27.222
- What are you suggesting, then?
- Nothing.

09:27.333 --> 09:33.863
Dr Fountain brought me in for my scientific
expertise and l must say l'm glad he did.

09:35.575 --> 09:40.342
Dr Bronzino, you should know
we may be looking at a murder.

09:40.413 --> 09:43.940
A murder? Are there any suspects?

10:30.329 --> 10:37.758
Natalie Gordon, the lady in Captain Dare's
short life and the last person to see him alive.

10:39.005 --> 10:42.133
- Leave me alone.
- lt's for the memorial video.

10:42.241 --> 10:45.301
For a fallen hero.
A few words for Captain Dare.

10:45.411 --> 10:47.675
You want a few words, Winky?

10:47.780 --> 10:53.275
You're ajerk, and so's your brother,
for making Bill do those stupid stunts.

10:53.352 --> 10:58.756
Captain Dare died doing what he loved,
pushing the envelope.

10:58.824 --> 11:01.418
Maybe if you weren't such a...

11:05.531 --> 11:08.932
Hey, you. Freaky-Deaky.

11:09.001 --> 11:13.961
You want your own memorial?
You wanna be in Dumb Ass?

11:14.040 --> 11:16.008
Just leave her alone.

11:16.108 --> 11:18.599
l'm talking to you now, freak.

11:22.114 --> 11:25.982
David Winkle. ln my office, right now.

11:28.220 --> 11:32.953
Typical. Lokensgard's gonna have
his mommy stick up for him.

11:33.025 --> 11:34.890
Baby.

12:12.565 --> 12:15.762
That is it. There it is.

12:15.868 --> 12:21.238
l just solved this case. This kid had
crap for brains. The flies couldn't resist.

12:21.340 --> 12:26.505
- And you were a choirboy growing up?
- We were stupid, but we didn't know it.

12:26.579 --> 12:29.605
This isn'tjust stupid, this glorifies stupid.

12:29.715 --> 12:32.912
These kids take pride in being sub-mental.

12:33.018 --> 12:36.044
That's why they call it Dumb Ass.

12:44.029 --> 12:47.692
- Mr David Winkle.
- Sky Pilot Winky.

12:47.767 --> 12:50.895
Just the man we wanna see. Come on in.

12:59.779 --> 13:03.545
- Very entertaining, Sky Pilot.
- Sky Commander.

13:03.616 --> 13:07.074
You can call me Sheriff John
as l haul your dumb ass to jail.

13:07.153 --> 13:11.214
- What are you talkin' about?
- We have a recent email you sent,

13:11.290 --> 13:14.623
offering the video of this death
to the Fox network.

13:14.727 --> 13:19.562
No, l wrote all the networks.
Fox were the only one who were interested.

13:19.632 --> 13:22.829
l don't think you understand.

13:22.935 --> 13:25.597
You think l killed him?

13:26.472 --> 13:30.670
You think l'd kill Captain Dare
to make money? My best friend?

13:30.776 --> 13:33.836
You were the last person
to have contact with him.

13:33.946 --> 13:39.441
You gave him his helmet at the top of the hill.
l think you put something in it.

13:40.519 --> 13:44.250
- Sit down, Sky Commander.
- l can't. l'm being attacked.

13:44.323 --> 13:47.121
Oh, God, it's happening to me.

13:56.202 --> 13:58.329
Now that's a dumb-ass.

14:22.795 --> 14:26.322
Where you been?
Dinner's been on the table an hour.

14:26.398 --> 14:28.491
l'm not hungry.

14:29.301 --> 14:32.668
Then you sit down here until you get hungry.

14:32.738 --> 14:34.501
Dylan?

14:34.573 --> 14:38.532
l have something to talk to you about.

16:06.932 --> 16:09.992
l'm glad you're here. We got our first break.

16:10.102 --> 16:14.232
- What'd you find?
- lt's what Rocky Bronzino found.

16:14.306 --> 16:20.074
The flies that ate at the brain and skull
of the victim are all female. Every one.

16:20.145 --> 16:24.605
- Exactly how is that a break?
- What are the chances of that?

16:24.683 --> 16:30.019
You mean the absence of males suggests
a reason for the attack, behaviorally?

16:30.122 --> 16:35.253
Something biological - hormonal or chemical
- caused these bugs to attack.

16:35.327 --> 16:38.626
- Or a need to express themselves.
- Say what?

16:39.798 --> 16:42.323
The kid known as Sky Commander Winky.

16:42.434 --> 16:46.700
Agent Reyes and l were interviewing him
when this happened.

16:46.805 --> 16:51.299
Paramedics treated him
for an aggressive attack of body lice.

16:51.377 --> 16:54.938
Lice are not uncommon
in a school environment.

16:55.014 --> 16:58.711
But these are better spellers
than most of the kids.

16:58.817 --> 17:03.015
- So is this just another Dumb Ass stunt?
- That was my thought.

17:03.122 --> 17:07.354
But he was too freaked out
to make me believe he'd staged this.

17:07.459 --> 17:11.987
Which makes me think that while
you're right about this being biology,

17:12.064 --> 17:15.693
someone is directing the biology.

17:15.800 --> 17:18.634
How does one direct bugs?

17:18.704 --> 17:23.403
l don't know, but we've been
running down a long list of witnesses.

17:25.144 --> 17:31.708
A loner who was at every Dumb Ass stunt. He
had a run-in with Winky before the lice attack.

17:31.817 --> 17:34.843
His name is Dylan Lokensgard.
We'll talk to him.

17:54.840 --> 17:58.367
He's just not well. He's unable to talk.

18:17.696 --> 18:21.029
Dylan, l wanna have a talk with you.

18:23.569 --> 18:26.265
Honey, can you come out here?

18:42.788 --> 18:45.882
- Where are you going?
- To school.

18:45.958 --> 18:48.654
l know where you're going.

18:48.760 --> 18:54.062
- What did Natalie want?
- Stay away from her. She's no good for you.

18:54.133 --> 18:56.829
We've been friends since we were kids.

18:56.935 --> 19:00.996
But you're not kids any more,
which is why we need to talk.

19:01.106 --> 19:05.008
Your body is going through changes.

19:05.110 --> 19:09.012
You don't understand anything.
l don't wanna talk to you.

19:09.114 --> 19:12.572
l wish Dad was still here.
You know nothing about me.

19:12.651 --> 19:18.283
Honey, l want what's best for you.
Dylan, come back here.

19:27.666 --> 19:33.195
So many flowers, so little time.

19:34.473 --> 19:39.604
- Excuse me?
- Pheromones, Dr Scully. Heavy in the air.

19:39.678 --> 19:45.116
Nature's natural attractants, driving
the insect world to go forth and pollinate.

19:45.184 --> 19:50.986
l'm aware how pheromones work. According
to this there are no pheromones here.

19:51.056 --> 19:53.616
That can't be right.

19:53.692 --> 19:58.356
The sensor is an actual fly antenna,
over which the pheromones pass.

19:58.463 --> 20:01.364
l modified the EAG
to measure in picograms,

20:01.466 --> 20:04.492
making it sensitive
for a mile in any direction.

20:04.570 --> 20:11.408
l still don't see why pheromones might cause
a harmless fly to attack a human, Doctor.

20:11.510 --> 20:13.307
Rocky.

20:16.248 --> 20:20.014
Bugs are small-minded
and therefore very predictable.

20:20.085 --> 20:24.351
They don't have moods.
They react to circumstance and stimuli.

20:24.423 --> 20:27.221
They have been doing it for millennia.

20:27.326 --> 20:31.558
So what do you suppose
they're reacting to out here?

20:33.398 --> 20:39.200
lt may be the bugs are being
somehow driven crazy with desire.

20:39.871 --> 20:45.173
They say we humans
respond to pheromones too.

20:46.078 --> 20:49.741
- l agree with that.
- Women's dormitory syndrome.

20:49.848 --> 20:56.014
Pheromones are the reason that women who
live together share the same menstrual cycle.

20:56.888 --> 20:58.685
Fascinating.

20:58.757 --> 21:06.596
When a male and female calliphorid fly mate,
they are joined for up to one and a half hours.

21:06.698 --> 21:10.361
One and a half, Doctor.

21:11.603 --> 21:14.936
Rocky, l'm a mother.

21:16.608 --> 21:18.974
Mothers are women too.

21:23.215 --> 21:25.308
- Big hit.
- What is it?

21:25.417 --> 21:29.615
A high concentration of C-13 calliphorone.

21:29.721 --> 21:31.780
lncoming.

22:10.962 --> 22:13.522
- Are you all right?
- l'm fine.

22:15.534 --> 22:19.163
- What about your bike?
- l'll get it later.

22:21.473 --> 22:25.170
- l came by your house to see you.
- Really?

22:25.277 --> 22:28.212
Your mom said
something was wrong with you.

22:28.313 --> 22:30.304
Me? No, l'm fine.

22:30.382 --> 22:33.180
What did you want?

22:33.285 --> 22:39.849
l wanted to apologize about
what happened yesterday at the cafeteria.

22:39.958 --> 22:42.518
Winky can be such ajerk.

22:44.396 --> 22:46.887
l was just worried about you.

22:52.070 --> 22:54.436
What did l say?

22:54.506 --> 22:56.565
Nothing.

22:57.876 --> 23:00.367
No one understands.

23:02.914 --> 23:06.850
My mom and dad think
it's just gonna go away.

23:06.918 --> 23:09.250
What l'm feeling.

23:10.689 --> 23:13.522
You mean about Bill?

23:15.861 --> 23:19.661
l wish you could just turn back time.

23:19.731 --> 23:25.567
l wish you could just make everything
go away, and start all over again.

23:25.670 --> 23:29.197
l know, like when we were kids.

23:32.911 --> 23:36.904
Remember that night
we played hide-and-seek on your street?

23:37.015 --> 23:39.074
Manhunt.

23:40.118 --> 23:42.609
We hid in the tree together.

23:46.191 --> 23:48.887
Our names are still carved in it.

23:53.565 --> 23:55.795
l'm gonna be late.

24:04.109 --> 24:06.373
Dylan Lokensgard?

24:07.212 --> 24:10.204
Can you come with us, Dylan?

24:12.884 --> 24:18.322
And now the awesome Captain Dare
will make Dumb Ass history...

24:21.827 --> 24:25.820
- Why are you showing me this?
- What do you think of it?

24:25.931 --> 24:31.096
- You mean The Dumb Ass Show?
- That and the kids who make it.

24:32.304 --> 24:34.431
l know 'em.

24:34.506 --> 24:39.603
You ever have contact with Bill,
the kid who played Captain Dare?

24:40.745 --> 24:44.340
You have anything against him?

24:44.449 --> 24:49.011
Do you think it's strange that
he was attacked and killed by insects?

24:49.120 --> 24:51.520
Who wouldn't?

24:54.159 --> 24:57.026
- What's going on?
- We're talking to Dylan.

24:57.128 --> 24:59.153
No, you're not. Dylan.

24:59.264 --> 25:03.792
No one interrogates my son in my office
without my permission.

25:03.869 --> 25:07.430
- Calm down.
- He's not a part of that crowd.

25:07.506 --> 25:11.772
- What are you accusing him of?
- We're just asking what he knows.

25:11.843 --> 25:15.438
- He doesn't know anything.
- He was at the crime scene.

25:15.514 --> 25:18.108
So were a lot of kids. Dylan...

25:35.567 --> 25:39.230
Too late, gentlemen. The bugs are gone.

25:40.872 --> 25:43.705
Bugs are all gone.

25:43.808 --> 25:46.242
Whatever.

25:51.149 --> 25:54.050
- How is he?
- He's unhurt, apparently.

25:54.152 --> 25:57.053
Not so much as a single bite on him.

25:59.090 --> 26:02.821
Mrs Lokensgard,
we haven't finished talking to Dylan.

26:02.894 --> 26:05.886
Yes, you have. We're going home.

26:27.552 --> 26:33.184
l've said it before. This case is attracting flies
because somebody's full of crap.

26:33.258 --> 26:36.022
l think what we just saw was a show.

26:36.094 --> 26:41.930
Dylan made the bugs attack him to make
himself look like a victim, not the perpetrator.

26:42.033 --> 26:45.867
OK, but how?
This guy's a horse whisperer for bugs?

26:45.937 --> 26:50.033
l don't know how he's doing it,
but l may know a way to find out.

26:58.283 --> 27:02.310
- Where did you get this?
- Dylan gave it to us in his interview.

27:02.420 --> 27:07.119
There's not a lot to be found
in a teenage boy's sweaty Kleenex.

27:07.225 --> 27:11.059
You want pheromones.
Aren't they in adolescent sweat?

27:11.129 --> 27:17.728
Yes, it's what causes BO. But obviously
it's not all that attractive - to anything.

27:26.978 --> 27:30.072
l've got a reading going right off the scale.

27:30.982 --> 27:32.847
Holy Toledo.

27:32.951 --> 27:39.186
We got pheromones coming out the
Yin-Yang here. C-13 calliphorone, and how.

27:43.828 --> 27:47.855
- What happened?
- l think my electroantennogram tilted.

27:47.966 --> 27:52.460
- What's C-13 calliphorone?
- lnsect pheromone.

27:52.537 --> 27:56.940
- Where did you find this mother lode?
- A boy, Dylan Lokensgard.

27:57.008 --> 28:00.171
That specimen came from him.

28:01.379 --> 28:06.976
A boy secreting bug pheromones?
That's impossible. Preposterous.

28:07.052 --> 28:11.216
You're the expert, Dr Bronzino.
How else do you explain it?

28:15.360 --> 28:17.351
Rocky?

28:17.462 --> 28:22.798
A boy is a boy, a bug is a bug.
You can't have it both ways.

28:22.867 --> 28:27.702
He's going through puberty.
Maybe his body chemistry is going crazy

28:27.806 --> 28:31.799
and his raging teenage hormones
are attracting insects.

28:31.876 --> 28:35.835
What if it's more than chemistry
or hormones or biology?

28:35.914 --> 28:39.577
Dylan's notjust attracting bugs.
He's using them.

28:39.684 --> 28:42.517
Yes, but against what?

28:42.587 --> 28:48.423
- We saw him talking to a girl.
- The one in the Dumb Ass video.

28:48.526 --> 28:51.222
Captain Dare's girlfriend.

29:19.424 --> 29:22.450
- What are you doing?
- l need to talk to you.

29:22.560 --> 29:26.894
You have to be quiet.
My mom's gonna hear you.

29:27.565 --> 29:30.033
l'm coming up.

29:30.101 --> 29:32.035
What? No.

29:43.481 --> 29:47.941
- You're gonna break your neck.
- l needed to see you.

30:03.935 --> 30:06.495
l haven't been here in so long.

30:08.773 --> 30:11.401
Since fourth grade.

30:12.177 --> 30:14.270
After school.

30:15.747 --> 30:18.272
lt was a Wednesday in April.

30:23.488 --> 30:26.150
''A dream in a mist of gray.''

30:29.594 --> 30:32.961
That's from a Syd Barrett song.

30:34.699 --> 30:39.136
- How do you know all these things?
- My dad told me.

30:40.772 --> 30:45.004
Syd Barrett, he was in the band Pink Floyd.

30:45.109 --> 30:49.102
He was this brilliant guy
that nobody understood.

30:49.180 --> 30:51.842
Kinda like you.

30:51.950 --> 30:53.645
Me?

30:58.156 --> 31:02.115
l never said l was sorry when
your dad disappeared, Dylan.

31:02.193 --> 31:05.162
l never said a lot of things.

31:06.397 --> 31:09.059
But l wanna say 'em now.

31:12.170 --> 31:15.298
l know you've always cared about me.

31:17.542 --> 31:22.206
We've grown apart,
but l haven't forgotten you.

31:24.716 --> 31:29.983
And after we talked this morning at school,

31:30.722 --> 31:35.682
l realized how special you really are to me.

31:36.995 --> 31:39.555
l can't believe this.

31:41.232 --> 31:43.928
After what happened to Bill,

31:47.405 --> 31:54.834
l realized how important it is to have
someone who does understand you.

31:59.751 --> 32:02.413
l want us to do this.

32:11.896 --> 32:14.626
That was amazing.

32:26.811 --> 32:30.542
What was that?

32:30.615 --> 32:32.810
What was what?

32:32.917 --> 32:36.114
Your tongue.
There's something wrong with you.

32:36.220 --> 32:38.484
No, don't say that.

32:39.624 --> 32:42.593
- l need to go.
- Natalie, please don't.

32:42.660 --> 32:45.151
Just stay. Let me talk to you.

32:50.101 --> 32:52.001
Natalie, listen to me.

32:52.103 --> 32:54.162
Natalie, please.

33:09.287 --> 33:12.188
Hey, Bug Boy.

33:12.290 --> 33:16.420
How about we go for
a little buzz around the block?

33:21.499 --> 33:24.991
So, Lokensgard, how'd you do it?

33:25.103 --> 33:27.196
How'd you kill him?

33:28.439 --> 33:34.275
- Bugs killed Captain Dare.
- Yeah, bugs that do what you say.

33:34.345 --> 33:37.610
You wanna know how l did it?

33:38.349 --> 33:40.647
l'll show you.

33:41.519 --> 33:44.647
Maybe you should get your camera ready.

33:46.891 --> 33:52.158
- What are you talkin' about?
- l just have to open my mouth.

33:52.230 --> 33:55.722
What the hell... Oh, God!

34:40.844 --> 34:45.908
l'm getting a reading here.
Trace levels inside the house.

34:47.585 --> 34:50.782
l guess that's probable cause.

34:53.858 --> 34:56.554
Dr Scully?

34:56.627 --> 35:00.757
This is so exciting.
l've never had a partner before.

35:01.299 --> 35:03.290
l have.

35:03.401 --> 35:06.700
l think of it as a hymenopteran relationship.

35:06.771 --> 35:11.799
Two scientists reaching higher
than either of them could reach alone.

35:11.909 --> 35:15.811
lf l may say so, Doctor,
you complete me.

35:18.416 --> 35:22.045
- l got upstairs, you take down.
- All right.

35:44.575 --> 35:46.270
Oh, God.

35:47.678 --> 35:51.136
David Winkle, is that you?

35:51.249 --> 35:54.912
- Now that's a dumb-ass.
- lt wasn't a stunt.

35:54.986 --> 35:57.784
lt was Dylan Lokensgard. He attacked us.

35:57.855 --> 36:01.757
- He attacked you?
- The dude's a freakin' bug.

36:01.826 --> 36:04.954
He chewed right out the back window.

36:09.133 --> 36:13.160
You stay. l'll see that Dylan
didn't head to that girl's house.

36:23.681 --> 36:25.376
Where are you?

36:25.483 --> 36:29.214
l'm with Rocky at the Lokensgard house.
Nobody's here.

36:29.320 --> 36:31.447
l'm afraid the kid's on a tear.

36:31.522 --> 36:36.960
- He's caused an accident on Glenhaven Road.
- How'd he do that?

36:38.162 --> 36:40.357
Better see for yourself.

36:45.036 --> 36:47.869
C-13 calliphorone. l got a reading up here.

36:47.972 --> 36:51.965
Dylan's bedroom's up there.
Unfortunately he's not in it.

36:52.043 --> 36:55.501
- Where are you going?
- Kid's on a rampage.

36:57.481 --> 37:00.473
You got my number, partner.

37:07.191 --> 37:11.218
- Natalie?
- Whoever you are, leave me alone.

37:11.329 --> 37:14.059
l'm Monica Reyes, with the FBl.

37:14.165 --> 37:17.532
l'm here because l need your help.

37:17.602 --> 37:21.003
- lt's about Dylan.
- Don't say that name.

37:21.072 --> 37:24.508
lt's important.
You may be the key to stopping him.

37:24.575 --> 37:30.707
Dylan Lokensgard is a freak.
l thought he was the normal one.

37:30.781 --> 37:34.342
l think Dylan was normal, like any other kid.

37:34.418 --> 37:37.387
This is to do with what he's becoming.

37:37.455 --> 37:41.949
- He kissed me.
- And it's probably what he's living for.

37:42.059 --> 37:46.018
lt's probably why he attacked
David Winkle and his brother.

37:46.097 --> 37:48.691
- He attacked Winky?
- They'll be OK.

37:48.766 --> 37:54.432
We just wanna make sure
he doesn't hurt anyone else.

37:54.538 --> 37:56.472
Come with me.

38:05.716 --> 38:09.743
- Why did you run from me?
- What is wrong with you?

38:10.888 --> 38:17.123
l'm different. lsn't that what you wanted?
Somebody different from Bill and Winky.

38:17.228 --> 38:21.392
- You killed Bill.
- To keep you from being killed.

38:23.067 --> 38:28.130
- And now you're coming with me.
- Stay where you are, Dylan.

39:09.880 --> 39:15.785
Don't try and stop me. That little talk
you wanted to have, it'll have to wait.

39:15.853 --> 39:20.290
- Where do you think you're going?
- We're going, me and Natalie.

39:20.358 --> 39:22.952
- l'll be taking the car.
- You won't.

39:23.027 --> 39:27.191
Don't cross me. l'm not
a kid everybody can kick around any more.

39:27.298 --> 39:29.994
You think l don't know what you are?

39:31.068 --> 39:37.166
lt's what l've been trying to tell you,
to save you from what you are about to do.

39:39.477 --> 39:45.882
These are the things l couldn't tell you,
the things l couldn't tell your father.

39:45.983 --> 39:48.713
You are not like the other kids.

39:51.389 --> 39:54.017
You never will be.

39:56.761 --> 39:58.661
Monica.

40:01.732 --> 40:03.597
Holy Mother.

40:03.701 --> 40:06.602
Monica, hold on. Can you hear me?

40:06.704 --> 40:10.003
Can you breathe? Monica, talk to me.

40:10.074 --> 40:12.565
- He's got the girl.
- Where'd they go?

40:12.676 --> 40:16.840
- To Dylan's house.
- That's where Scully is.

40:16.914 --> 40:21.613
She lost phone contact
with the entomologist Bronzino.

40:35.966 --> 40:39.094
Where are they?

41:21.445 --> 41:23.504
Help me.

41:33.023 --> 41:35.321
Help me.

42:11.395 --> 42:14.364
Four bodies were found in the attic,

42:14.465 --> 42:19.903
including that of Michael Lokensgard,
Dylan's father, long reported missing.

42:20.004 --> 42:24.236
He, like the others,
fell victim to Dylan's mother,

42:24.341 --> 42:30.143
who, in Dr Rocky Bronzino's expert opinion,
was neither human nor insect,

42:30.214 --> 42:33.877
but something in between,
a biological anomaly

42:33.984 --> 42:38.978
whose difference from the rest of humanity
could be hidden only for so long.

42:39.056 --> 42:42.856
However strong
Dylan Lokensgard's yearning to fit in,

42:42.927 --> 42:46.920
to win acceptance, to love and to be loved,

42:47.031 --> 42:51.525
he could not defeat the unseen forces
which direct behavior.

42:51.602 --> 42:56.062
ln the struggle between our desire
to determine what we will be

42:56.173 --> 43:01.702
and the identity which biology defines for us,
there can only be one outcome.

43:01.779 --> 43:06.580
But even in victory, there are
forces biology cannot defeat.

43:06.684 --> 43:09.084
The stirrings of the soul,

43:09.186 --> 43:11.711
the mysteries of desire,

43:11.789 --> 43:17.523
the simple truth that
the heart wants what the heart wants.
