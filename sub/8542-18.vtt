WEBVTT

00:01.697 --> 00:03.699
[theme music]

00:03.786 --> 00:05.483
[Lisbon]
'You're gonna like this one.
It's unusual.'

00:05.570 --> 00:07.529
'You are never gonna guess
how the victim was found.'

00:07.616 --> 00:08.791
Oh, really?

00:08.878 --> 00:10.836
[animal roars]

00:10.923 --> 00:13.143
That is unusual.

00:13.230 --> 00:15.972
Panthera tigris,
if I'm not mistaken.

00:16.059 --> 00:19.671
And there's soft loamy soil
around here

00:19.758 --> 00:21.499
easily worked.

00:21.586 --> 00:23.458
Ergo, a hungry tiger
dug up the body.

00:23.545 --> 00:26.635
Not fair. Uh, there's
a big cat sanctuary around here.

00:26.722 --> 00:29.333
A drunk guy broke in,
freed the tigers

00:29.420 --> 00:31.466
including the one
that discovered our victim.

00:31.553 --> 00:33.033
From the general
state of calm, I take it

00:33.120 --> 00:34.860
that all the tigers
have been rounded up?

00:34.947 --> 00:36.514
As far as you know.

00:36.601 --> 00:38.386
[tigers growling]

00:38.473 --> 00:39.909
[Patrick]
'Hello, kitty-cat.'

00:39.996 --> 00:42.738
[growling continues]

00:42.825 --> 00:44.522
Hard to believe
it's a man-eater.

00:44.609 --> 00:47.047
It was still clawing up
the ground when they got here.

00:47.134 --> 00:48.178
Come on.

00:48.265 --> 00:49.832
[growling continues]

00:49.919 --> 00:52.661
The coroner's investigator
thinks it's suffocation.

00:52.748 --> 00:54.271
Looks like the victim
was killed somewhere else

00:54.358 --> 00:56.578
and then buried here,
based on the lividity pattern.

00:56.665 --> 00:58.536
Oh. Plus there's
a wheelbarrow track here.

00:58.623 --> 00:59.798
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, that, too.

01:01.844 --> 01:03.019
Who was he?

01:03.106 --> 01:04.803
John Doe.
No wallet, no ID.

01:04.890 --> 01:06.240
Well, don't fret.

01:06.327 --> 01:08.633
Rich dead men don't go
unclaimed for very long.

01:08.720 --> 01:10.026
Rich? He's wearing hemp.

01:10.113 --> 01:12.159
He certainly is.
And who wears hemp?

01:12.246 --> 01:15.771
Other than rich men
and medieval peasants?

01:15.858 --> 01:17.381
Yeah, this one's
been reupholstered.

01:17.468 --> 01:19.166
Check out
that tight jawline.

01:19.253 --> 01:21.298
He's certainly not
a medieval peasant.

01:21.385 --> 01:22.299
Face-lift?

01:22.386 --> 01:23.735
I'm guessing.

01:23.822 --> 01:26.129
'Oh. It's a
black diamond wedding band.'

01:26.216 --> 01:28.131
'That's a current trend.
Am I right?'

01:28.218 --> 01:30.307
Looks like he was dieting.
Check out his belt.

01:30.394 --> 01:32.266
[Patrick]
'Yeah. Rapid weight loss.'

01:32.353 --> 01:35.791
Could be dieting.
Could be something else.

01:35.878 --> 01:37.053
[inhales deeply]
Ew!

01:37.140 --> 01:39.011
That's not decomp.
What is that?

01:39.099 --> 01:41.623
[exhales]
The smell of desperation?

01:41.710 --> 01:43.538
Got a match
on our John Doe.

01:43.625 --> 01:45.496
Archer Braddock.
Local car dealer.

01:45.583 --> 01:47.150
Wife and two children.

01:47.237 --> 01:49.065
His wife filed
a missing persons last night.

01:49.152 --> 01:52.329
It says Braddock
had stage 4 bone cancer.

01:52.416 --> 01:54.723
Killing a man
that's already dying.

01:54.810 --> 01:56.551
That's a little redundant,
don't you think?

01:56.638 --> 01:58.292
[man on radio]
'Be advised that
one tiger is still outstanding.'

01:58.379 --> 01:59.858
- 'They made a mistake..'
- What did he say?

01:59.945 --> 02:01.425
...counting the tigers.
There's still one on the loose!

02:01.512 --> 02:03.297
We'll meet you back
at the CBI.

02:03.384 --> 02:04.341
[indistinct chatter]

02:04.428 --> 02:05.603
You are a cool customer.

02:05.690 --> 02:07.127
You think you can
outrun a tiger?

02:07.214 --> 02:09.781
I don't have to. I just have
to run faster than you.

02:09.868 --> 02:11.740
[instrumental music]

02:13.394 --> 02:15.265
[theme music]

02:18.181 --> 02:19.748

02:23.186 --> 02:24.492
[instrumental music]

02:24.579 --> 02:26.972
[baby crying]

02:30.411 --> 02:33.283
[crying continues]

02:36.373 --> 02:37.418
[female #1]
'It's okay, honey.'

02:37.505 --> 02:40.290
[crying continues]

02:40.377 --> 02:43.685
Sorry.
Excuse me.

02:43.772 --> 02:45.556
You ready to be a daddy?
That's gonna be you soon.

02:45.643 --> 02:47.384
Oh no. I can cry
much louder than that.

02:52.955 --> 02:54.261
Where's Cho?

02:54.348 --> 02:55.305
I haven't seen him yet.

02:55.392 --> 02:57.133
Coroner investigator's report.

02:57.220 --> 02:59.701
Putting the TOD between eight
at night and two in morning.

02:59.788 --> 03:01.093
That's a pretty big window.

03:01.181 --> 03:02.704
What did the coroner say
about cause of death?

03:02.791 --> 03:04.227
Uh, she didn't, she's dealing
with a multi-victim

03:04.314 --> 03:05.881
pile-up on the I-80.

03:05.968 --> 03:08.666
No coroner. Alright,
what about motive, suspects?

03:08.753 --> 03:11.191
Braddock had a lot of money.
He had to have had enemies.

03:11.278 --> 03:13.236
Braddock owned
three luxury car dealerships

03:13.323 --> 03:14.672
but when he found out
he was dying

03:14.759 --> 03:16.587
he sold his stake to his
employees at a discount.

03:16.674 --> 03:17.893
The man was kind of a saint.

03:17.980 --> 03:19.503
Do we have any leads?

03:19.590 --> 03:21.157
Braddock wascarrying
a pocket calendar.

03:21.244 --> 03:22.506
His last appointment
before his murder

03:22.593 --> 03:24.465
was at 4:17 p.m.

03:24.552 --> 03:26.902
Pretty specific time.

03:26.989 --> 03:28.295
The entry just says
"Treatment."

03:28.382 --> 03:29.992
- Doctor's treatment?
- I don't know.

03:30.079 --> 03:32.037
And a lot of entries like that
over the last few weeks

03:32.124 --> 03:33.430
each one at a weird time.

03:33.517 --> 03:34.953
I'll go and talk
to the wife about it.

03:35.040 --> 03:36.346
You two stay here
and keep pushing.

03:36.433 --> 03:38.609
And tellCho to
get his ass to work.

03:38.696 --> 03:41.569
[instrumental music]

03:44.963 --> 03:46.878
[snoring]

[music continues]

03:56.323 --> 03:58.238
[music continues]

04:00.370 --> 04:01.328
Good morning, Kimball Cho.

04:01.415 --> 04:02.764
- Good morning.
- Hmm?

04:02.851 --> 04:04.156
That smells good.

04:04.244 --> 04:06.376
It's hand-pressed French roast.

04:06.463 --> 04:08.073
Mmm.

04:09.249 --> 04:10.380
[cap pops]

04:10.467 --> 04:12.991
[pills rattle]

04:13.078 --> 04:14.863
Hey, those are mine.

04:14.950 --> 04:16.691
It's for pain.

04:16.778 --> 04:19.389
I've got pain.

04:19.476 --> 04:21.043
- No, you don't.
- Mmm.

04:22.697 --> 04:24.133
Don't be so stingy.

04:24.220 --> 04:26.222
I'm not stingywith you, am I?

04:26.309 --> 04:28.093
No.

04:28.180 --> 04:29.312
No, you're not.

04:31.836 --> 04:35.405
Mmm!

04:35.492 --> 04:37.538
[instrumental music]

04:39.279 --> 04:41.455
[cell phone rings]
Um-uh.

04:41.542 --> 04:42.847
[phone ringing continues]
No.

04:42.934 --> 04:44.632
No, no, no, no, no.
Not-no, not now.

04:44.719 --> 04:46.503
- It might be work.
- Oh-ah.

04:46.590 --> 04:47.722
[ringing continues]

04:50.246 --> 04:51.421
Ah, that can't be right.

04:53.641 --> 04:55.469
My alarm didn't go off.

04:55.556 --> 04:58.123
Oh. That's because
I turned your alarm off.

04:58.210 --> 05:00.430
I thought you could use
some more sleep.

05:00.517 --> 05:02.432
[sighs]
Damn it, Summer,
I'm late for work.

05:02.519 --> 05:04.521
Lisbon's gonna be
somad at you.

05:04.608 --> 05:05.914
Scary.

05:06.001 --> 05:07.829
No. No. I'm never
late for work.

05:09.526 --> 05:10.701
Well, maybe
it's a good thing.

05:10.788 --> 05:12.877
I mean, it's a...new experience.

05:14.662 --> 05:16.707
You know?

05:16.794 --> 05:17.795
I gotta get ready.

05:21.712 --> 05:24.672
[car approaching]

05:24.759 --> 05:27.152
[Lisbon]
'Looks like somebody's
in for a big inheritance.'

05:27.239 --> 05:29.329
Mm, I suppose, if you go
for that sort of thing.

05:30.155 --> 05:31.113
You mean money?

05:31.200 --> 05:33.245
I'll take health any day.

05:33.333 --> 05:34.812
Once the game's over,
the king and the pawn

05:34.899 --> 05:36.945
go back into the same box.

05:37.032 --> 05:39.687
[doorbell rings]
Shall we?

05:39.774 --> 05:41.210
We're with the CBI.

05:41.297 --> 05:43.517
I'm Agent Teresa Lisbon.
This is Patrick Jane.

05:43.604 --> 05:45.519
- Uh, can we come in?
- Yeah.

05:50.480 --> 05:51.568
[door clicks]

05:53.091 --> 05:54.136
Uh..

05:54.223 --> 05:55.703
Are you Liesl?

05:55.790 --> 05:56.791
That's right.

05:56.878 --> 05:58.532
We're sorry for your loss.

05:58.619 --> 06:00.534
I don't...want to talk
about it.

06:00.621 --> 06:02.927
Of course you don't...uh, maybe
you can TO us

06:03.014 --> 06:04.189
to someone in charge.

06:05.234 --> 06:06.844
You sound like my dad.

06:06.931 --> 06:08.585
- TO?
- Car sales lingo.

06:08.672 --> 06:10.500
- Who manages the house?
- Helen.

06:10.587 --> 06:11.501
Your mother?

06:11.588 --> 06:13.329
Stepmother, I'm guessing.

06:13.416 --> 06:15.070
She's upstairs...in bed.

06:15.157 --> 06:17.420
Could you ask her to come down
and talk to us?

06:17.507 --> 06:20.510
She can't handle
the stairs right now.

06:20.597 --> 06:22.077
She's too weak.

06:23.165 --> 06:25.689
Helen has cancer, too.

06:25.776 --> 06:28.344
Welcome to the house of fun.

06:32.130 --> 06:33.567
That's how I met Archer.

06:33.654 --> 06:36.178
We were attending
a cancer support group.

06:36.265 --> 06:37.919
How long ago was that?

06:38.006 --> 06:40.051
Nine months ago.

06:40.138 --> 06:42.402
I know it sounds
a little...strange

06:42.489 --> 06:44.708
but it was quite
a romantic courtship.

06:44.795 --> 06:47.015
And a short one.

06:47.102 --> 06:48.669
Well, that's what happens
when you're living

06:48.756 --> 06:51.193
with an expiration date.

06:51.280 --> 06:53.325
The wedding was two months ago.

06:53.413 --> 06:55.632
Liesl was a bridesmaid.

06:55.719 --> 06:58.243
'So beautiful.'

06:58.330 --> 07:00.376
We knew we might not have
a lot of time together

07:00.463 --> 07:03.466
but it wasn't supposed
to end like this.

07:03.553 --> 07:05.425
According to his calendar
your husband had

07:05.512 --> 07:06.904
multiple appointments for
treatments

07:06.991 --> 07:08.689
over the past few weeks.

07:08.776 --> 07:10.255
Who was he being treated by?

07:10.342 --> 07:12.606
Uh, Dr. Scheck.

07:12.693 --> 07:16.000
Archer was taking part in an
experimental drug protocol.

07:16.087 --> 07:17.828
Human guinea pig time.

07:21.528 --> 07:23.617
Uh, can I help you
find something?

07:23.704 --> 07:25.793
Oh, I'm just fishing around.

07:25.880 --> 07:28.578
Who is this handsome young man
standing off to the side here?

07:28.665 --> 07:30.188
That's my brother Aden.

07:30.275 --> 07:32.495
Archer's oldest.

07:32.582 --> 07:34.976
- Where's Aden?
- Oh, no idea.

07:35.063 --> 07:38.501
He left the house after
a fight with Archer last year.

07:38.588 --> 07:41.112
They had a...
contentious relationship.

07:41.199 --> 07:43.201
How would you know?

07:43.288 --> 07:44.942
You didn't even know dad then.

07:48.859 --> 07:50.992
[Helen]
'She'll be okay.'

07:51.079 --> 07:53.821
It's been a tough day.
You can imagine.

07:54.996 --> 07:55.953
Excuse me.

07:56.040 --> 07:58.390
Mm-hmm.

07:58.478 --> 08:00.654
Mrs. Braddock, can you think of
anybody

08:00.741 --> 08:02.786
who may have wanted
to harm your husband?

08:03.613 --> 08:05.528
No. I can't.

08:06.747 --> 08:08.618
[dramatic music]

08:10.707 --> 08:13.362
[crying softly]
Uh..

08:13.449 --> 08:16.496
Do you mind if I
help myself to some tea?

08:16.583 --> 08:18.541
Sure.

08:18.628 --> 08:20.238
Thanks.

08:23.154 --> 08:25.679
[clattering]

08:29.770 --> 08:31.075
I'm trying to figure
something out.

08:31.162 --> 08:33.077
You might be able
to help me. Um..

08:33.164 --> 08:36.777
Clearly, your father liked to
live in the lap of luxury here

08:36.864 --> 08:39.823
but when I saw him,
he looked like he was

08:39.910 --> 08:43.261
headed on a pilgrimage
to an ashram in the Punjab.

08:43.348 --> 08:45.002
Yep.

08:45.089 --> 08:48.658
All hemp and natural fibers.

08:48.745 --> 08:51.661
'He got into it
a couple weeks ago.'

08:51.748 --> 08:54.403
He said that he wanted
his outside to bear testimony

08:54.490 --> 08:57.754
to what was happening
in the inside.

08:57.841 --> 09:00.931
Wh-what was happening
on the inside?

09:01.018 --> 09:03.804
My dad was getting healthy.

09:03.891 --> 09:07.329
The cancer was going away.

09:07.416 --> 09:08.548
That's what he said.

09:10.071 --> 09:11.115
Wrong.

09:11.202 --> 09:12.464
Interesting.

09:12.552 --> 09:14.554
Do you know who killed
your father?

09:14.641 --> 09:17.339
If I did,
they wouldn't be breathing.

09:17.426 --> 09:18.514
That's a dangerous path.

09:20.777 --> 09:21.952
Did Aden love him?

09:22.039 --> 09:22.997
Yeah.

09:24.955 --> 09:27.305
It's just..

09:27.392 --> 09:29.394
complicated.

09:29.481 --> 09:31.179
Your father kicked him out,
didn't he?

09:31.266 --> 09:33.268
My dad is
a recovering alcoholic.

09:35.270 --> 09:36.401
Was.

09:38.186 --> 09:41.276
It runs in the family...
addiction.

09:41.363 --> 09:44.148
For Aden, it was drugs.

09:44.235 --> 09:46.281
Dad said that Aden
had to hit bottom

09:46.368 --> 09:47.674
before he could rise up.

09:47.761 --> 09:49.632
[kettle whistling]

09:51.025 --> 09:51.982
Music to my ears.

09:54.202 --> 09:57.118
[whistling continues]

09:57.205 --> 09:58.598
Where would I
find the tea?

09:58.685 --> 10:00.077
First cabinet.

10:00.774 --> 10:02.427
Okay.

10:02.514 --> 10:04.908
[inhales deeply]
'That's dad's tea.'

10:04.995 --> 10:06.170
[rattles]

10:07.389 --> 10:08.520
[lid pops]

10:08.608 --> 10:09.565
[inhales deeply]
Ew!

10:09.652 --> 10:12.002
[laughs]

10:12.089 --> 10:14.265
Yeah, I bet you never
smelled that before.

10:14.352 --> 10:16.746
No, not since this morning.

10:16.833 --> 10:18.052
Where did your father
find this?

10:18.139 --> 10:20.054
No idea.

10:20.141 --> 10:22.752
It was his new fav.

10:22.839 --> 10:26.277
Jane...we need to go and talk
to Braddock's doctor.

10:26.364 --> 10:28.018
Is that the smell from, uh--

10:28.105 --> 10:29.890
Yes, it is.

10:29.977 --> 10:32.283
You, uh..

10:32.370 --> 10:34.416
...might want to bury that.

10:34.503 --> 10:35.504
Deep.

10:35.591 --> 10:36.810
[chuckles]
'Bye.'

10:41.249 --> 10:43.164
The victim's son
had a rap sheet.

10:44.252 --> 10:46.297
Aden Braddock.

10:46.384 --> 10:48.473
Disorderly conduct,
misdemeanor theft.

10:48.560 --> 10:49.910
Looks like the kid
went a little bit wild

10:49.997 --> 10:51.215
after his dad
threw him out.

10:51.302 --> 10:52.782
- Do we know where he lives?
- No.

10:52.869 --> 10:54.262
But the social security
trace shows him working

10:54.349 --> 10:56.046
at a banquet hall
in Agua Blanca.

10:56.133 --> 10:57.395
We also got his cell phone
number, too.

10:59.310 --> 11:02.139
Wait, I've that number before
in the victim's call log.

11:02.226 --> 11:03.663
[mouse clicking]

11:05.403 --> 11:07.928
Archer Braddock called
his son at 7:45 p.m.

11:08.015 --> 11:09.190
It was the last call he made.

11:09.277 --> 11:10.670
And Braddock's wife told Lisbon

11:10.757 --> 11:11.671
that they had
a contentious relationship.

11:13.585 --> 11:15.762
Oh. Good morning, Cho.

11:15.849 --> 11:17.546
- Hey.
- Everything okay?

11:17.633 --> 11:19.069
I just, uh,
overslept my alarm.

11:19.156 --> 11:20.375
Yeah, well, don't get
too comfortable.

11:20.462 --> 11:21.942
We got a lead
on the victim's son.

11:22.029 --> 11:23.683
- Catch you up on the way out.
- Alright.

11:23.770 --> 11:24.858
[cap pops]

11:27.774 --> 11:29.689
[dramatic music]

11:37.000 --> 11:39.916
[music continues]

11:40.003 --> 11:41.439
CBI. Looking
for Aden Braddock.

11:43.877 --> 11:44.834
'That guy.'

11:47.968 --> 11:50.274
[tray clatters]
'Stop, Aden.'

11:50.361 --> 11:51.972
[glasses shatter]

11:52.059 --> 11:54.931
[dramatic music]

11:56.367 --> 11:57.542
Stop! Police!

11:59.631 --> 12:00.676
[groans]

12:00.763 --> 12:02.678
[trays clatter]

12:02.765 --> 12:05.507
[intense music]

12:08.466 --> 12:11.382
[grunts]
Damn it.

12:17.214 --> 12:20.087
[indistinct conversations]

12:22.089 --> 12:24.047
Hi.

12:24.134 --> 12:26.310
Oh, you-you must be
the CBI people.

12:26.397 --> 12:28.269
I'm Betsy Firth,
nurse administrator.

12:28.356 --> 12:29.574
I'm Patrick Jane.

12:29.661 --> 12:31.794
I'm a consulting, uh,
consultant.

12:31.881 --> 12:33.143
And I'm Agent Lisbon.

12:33.230 --> 12:34.710
She's a detective.

12:34.797 --> 12:37.321
Dr. Scheck will be
with you in a minute.

12:37.408 --> 12:40.150
We were all very saddened
to hear about Archer Braddock.

12:40.237 --> 12:41.499
I pulled his files in case

12:41.586 --> 12:43.327
Dr. Scheck
needs to consult them.

12:43.414 --> 12:46.330
Well, thank you, Betsy.
That's very efficient of you.

12:46.417 --> 12:48.071
Mm. Well, we try.
Come on in.

12:49.812 --> 12:53.468
Dr. Scheck, the CBI people
are here to see you.

12:53.555 --> 12:55.165
[Lisbon]
'We just wanted to ask you
a few questions'

12:55.252 --> 12:56.645
'about Archer Braddock .'

12:56.732 --> 12:59.300
Oh, I was very sorry
to hear about that.

12:59.387 --> 13:01.650
We deal with death every day
here but not like that.

13:01.737 --> 13:03.260
It's...awful.

13:03.347 --> 13:06.176
Awful, yes...uh, what's the drug
you're testing here?

13:06.263 --> 13:08.483
Osevent. It's a
bone cancer treatment.

13:08.570 --> 13:11.007
It has the potential
to extend millions of lives.

13:11.094 --> 13:13.444
And earn millions of dollars.

13:13.531 --> 13:15.316
Well, that's not
why we developed it.

13:15.403 --> 13:17.622
No? Why not?

13:17.709 --> 13:19.320
Do you save lives
for the money?

13:19.407 --> 13:22.671
Well, folks are pretty much dead
by the time we show up.

13:22.758 --> 13:24.934
Uh, best we can hope for
is to catch the killer.

13:25.021 --> 13:26.414
Did you kill Archer Braddock?

13:29.025 --> 13:30.418
I'll be talking toyou
from now on.

13:30.505 --> 13:32.333
Yes. I just have
a few questions

13:32.420 --> 13:33.943
about Mr. Braddock's
last appointment.

13:34.030 --> 13:35.945
Hmm. Okay. Uh, Betsy.

13:36.032 --> 13:38.687
I laid out the Braddock file
in consult room 2.

13:38.774 --> 13:39.819
Follow me.

13:42.560 --> 13:45.346
I'll just, uh,
wait out here.

13:45.433 --> 13:47.957
[speaking inaudibly]

13:51.439 --> 13:54.659
The Braddock file
...daily report.

13:54.746 --> 13:58.011
And when you're done, you need
to sign these intake forms.

13:58.098 --> 13:59.795
[pen clicks]
Any new patients today?

13:59.882 --> 14:02.102
Four. Newly cleared
and qualified.

14:02.189 --> 14:03.364
I don't know how you do it.

14:05.409 --> 14:06.846
So how can I help you,
agent?

14:06.933 --> 14:08.238
Uh, Mr. Braddock's
last appointment

14:08.325 --> 14:09.718
was he acting strangely at all?

14:09.805 --> 14:11.241
Not that I recall, no.

14:11.328 --> 14:13.113
Did he say anything
unusual

14:13.200 --> 14:15.376
or mention where he was going
after the appointment?

14:15.463 --> 14:16.638
Let me check his file.

14:16.725 --> 14:18.248
It was just
yesterday afternoon.

14:18.335 --> 14:20.424
Yesterday? No, no, no. Uh.

14:20.511 --> 14:22.426
Braddock's last drug treatment
was two days ago in the morning.

14:22.513 --> 14:24.254
According to his calendar,
he had a treatment

14:24.341 --> 14:26.517
yesterday at 4:17 p.m.

14:26.604 --> 14:27.867
Well, not a medical treatment.

14:27.954 --> 14:29.825
Braddock was under
my exclusive care.

14:29.912 --> 14:31.696
And not to be indelicate, agent

14:31.783 --> 14:33.437
but when do I get access
to the body?

14:33.524 --> 14:35.178
- Access?
- I need to examine it.

14:35.265 --> 14:37.093
Obtain tissue samples
for my research.

14:37.180 --> 14:38.442
I-it's all part of the agreement

14:38.529 --> 14:40.227
our patients sign
when they join the study.

14:40.314 --> 14:42.055
Uh, you're gonna have to
take that up with the coroner

14:42.142 --> 14:43.491
and she's working on
another case.

14:43.578 --> 14:45.188
Might keep her busy
for a few days.

14:45.275 --> 14:47.190
I see.

14:47.277 --> 14:49.540
- Excuse me.
- Oh.

14:55.285 --> 14:56.852
Allow me.

14:56.939 --> 15:00.682
- Oh, well, thank you, handsome.
- Hmm.

15:00.769 --> 15:03.380
Take my advice.
Don't get cancer.

15:03.467 --> 15:05.165
Well, that sounds like
good advice.

15:05.252 --> 15:07.950
Although you do seem spry
despite all.

15:08.037 --> 15:09.430
You know, why not?

15:09.517 --> 15:11.388
Western wisdom says
I should have been dead

15:11.475 --> 15:13.260
nine months ago,
but look.

15:13.347 --> 15:14.870
I made it
to the bonus round.

15:14.957 --> 15:16.350
You credit the drugs here?

15:16.437 --> 15:19.353
- Could be the drugs.
- Could be the tea.

15:19.440 --> 15:20.745
You know about the tea?

15:20.832 --> 15:22.791
Yeah, I could smell it
in your handbag.

15:22.878 --> 15:25.925
No, no, no, no need, I got a
very strong whiff of it

15:26.012 --> 15:27.578
in Archer Braddock's kitchen.

15:27.665 --> 15:29.015
I heard about Archer
this morning.

15:29.102 --> 15:30.799
Were-were you a friend?

15:30.886 --> 15:33.497
Oh, no, no, no. I'm helping
the police solve the murder.

15:33.584 --> 15:36.544
Oh. Well, I was the one
who told Archer about the tea.

15:36.631 --> 15:39.764
I saw him a few weeks back,
and he wasn't looking so good.

15:39.851 --> 15:42.637
You know, he had this
air of finality hanging over him

15:42.724 --> 15:44.465
like a piano on a wire.

15:44.552 --> 15:47.120
Mm-hm...where would
one buy a tin

15:47.207 --> 15:49.644
of that stinky tea
if they had to?

15:49.731 --> 15:51.951
[Lisbon]
'Who closes shop
in the middle of the day?'

15:52.038 --> 15:53.387
[Patrick]
'Mmm.'

15:54.518 --> 15:56.738
[instrumental music]

15:57.913 --> 15:59.871
[door clicks open]

15:59.959 --> 16:01.221
They probably just forgot
to flip the sign.

16:06.182 --> 16:07.575
Hello?

16:07.662 --> 16:09.533
Is anyone here?

16:12.449 --> 16:14.103
What's the goal here,
anyway?

16:14.190 --> 16:16.323
So Braddock drinks
stinky tea.

16:16.410 --> 16:18.238
People who are dying
will try anything.

16:18.325 --> 16:20.805
Well, the stuff that Braddock
tried was working

16:20.892 --> 16:22.503
'or so he thought.'

16:22.590 --> 16:24.505
What, you think that has
something to do with his murder?

16:24.592 --> 16:27.856
No idea, but if Braddock
found the cure for cancer

16:27.943 --> 16:29.249
I want in on it.

16:29.336 --> 16:30.772
- Good luck with that.
- Shh!

16:30.859 --> 16:33.775
[muffled groaning]

16:35.516 --> 16:37.735
[whimpering and groaning]

16:37.822 --> 16:39.476
[Patrick mutters]

16:40.869 --> 16:43.480
[woman groaning loudly]

16:43.567 --> 16:45.352
'Help me.'

16:45.439 --> 16:47.223
[woman crying]

16:47.310 --> 16:50.487
- 'Help me. Helpme.'
- Stay back.

16:51.706 --> 16:52.663
[panting]
Help me!

16:52.750 --> 16:54.752
[Lisbon]
'Police!'

16:54.839 --> 16:59.192
Please. Calm your spirits.
It's okay. Everything's fine.

16:59.279 --> 17:01.107
[woman panting]
Shh.

17:01.194 --> 17:03.239
- What are you doing?
- What are youdoing?

17:08.679 --> 17:10.725
[instrumental music]

17:10.812 --> 17:12.640
[speaking inaudibly]

17:12.727 --> 17:13.945
[indistinct conversations]

17:14.033 --> 17:15.991
Welcome.
I'm Brother Josef.

17:16.078 --> 17:18.341
Oh, and I am not a hugger.

17:18.428 --> 17:21.214
[chuckles]
Patrick Jane. Nice to meet you.
That was a wonderful show.

17:21.301 --> 17:23.259
How much do you charge
for that show?

17:23.346 --> 17:26.045
- No show. A healing.
- Hmm.

17:26.132 --> 17:27.742
And my temple
accepts donations.

17:27.829 --> 17:29.613
Uh, it's entirely
up to you.

17:29.700 --> 17:33.400
Ahh. Another nonprofit.
Smart act.

17:33.487 --> 17:36.620
[chuckles]
I get that reaction a lot.

17:36.707 --> 17:38.100
But the healing powers
of the sun

17:38.187 --> 17:39.623
have been well-documented.

17:39.710 --> 17:41.625
- Then where does the tea fit?
- Tea?

17:41.712 --> 17:44.280
Yeah, the stinky red stuff,
curls the nose hairs.

17:44.367 --> 17:46.848
[chuckles]
You're talking about
the tea of clarity.

17:46.935 --> 17:48.719
It's pretty foul stuff.

17:48.806 --> 17:50.591
I had to take it
off our shelves recently.

17:50.678 --> 17:54.290
- Too many customer complaints.
- What's in it?

17:54.377 --> 17:58.947
A proprietary blend of nettles,
herbs, and possibility.

17:59.034 --> 18:01.080
And how much does that
go for these days?

18:01.167 --> 18:04.039
[chuckles]
You have me all wrong.

18:04.126 --> 18:05.954
I am a rich man
but you won't find

18:06.041 --> 18:08.522
my wealth in any bank account.

18:08.609 --> 18:11.307
I sell just enough teas
and holistic remedies

18:11.394 --> 18:13.092
to keep my temple doors open.

18:13.179 --> 18:15.703
And did you open them
to this man?

18:15.790 --> 18:17.313
Sure. Archer.

18:17.400 --> 18:21.187
We just performed
his final healing ceremony.

18:21.274 --> 18:22.753
At 4:17?

18:22.840 --> 18:25.495
That's when the solar flares
were at their peak.

18:25.582 --> 18:27.018
And what were you healing?

18:27.106 --> 18:28.846
His cancer, of course.

18:28.933 --> 18:34.069
We channel the solar corona
to target cancerous tumors.

18:34.156 --> 18:36.027
We had many tries
with Archer

18:36.115 --> 18:38.029
but we, we finally got 'em all.

18:38.117 --> 18:39.596
And all of his money.

18:39.683 --> 18:43.122
Archer didn't pay me
a penny, Mr. Jane.

18:43.209 --> 18:45.080
Well, except for the tea.

18:45.167 --> 18:46.690
Mmm. Is that why
you killed him?

18:46.777 --> 18:48.910
Excuse me?
What?

18:48.997 --> 18:51.042
Archer Braddock is dead.

18:51.130 --> 18:52.783
He was murdered
right after he left here.

18:52.870 --> 18:57.048
Oh, no. Oh, no, no, no.

18:57.136 --> 19:00.835
Not after all he fought through.

19:00.922 --> 19:03.011
After all our work.

19:03.098 --> 19:04.186
Oh, my God.

19:06.232 --> 19:07.189
[sighs]

19:09.365 --> 19:11.280
His-his reflexes
were better.

19:11.367 --> 19:13.978
His-his-his
pressure was way down.

19:14.065 --> 19:17.808
He had a-he had a ruddy,
healthy glow in his cheeks.

19:17.895 --> 19:19.767
- That part of the act?
- Hard to say.

19:19.854 --> 19:21.856
It's all so theatrical.

19:21.943 --> 19:24.554
Did Braddock say where he was
going when he was leaving?

19:24.641 --> 19:26.208
No, no. I-I have no idea.

19:28.471 --> 19:31.300
His transition from this world
was corrupted by violence.

19:31.387 --> 19:34.869
- I need to see his body.
- Why?

19:34.956 --> 19:38.351
To release his energy so he can
cross over peacefully.

19:38.438 --> 19:39.961
Maybe at the funeral.

19:40.048 --> 19:41.528
In the meantime,
you're gonna tell us

19:41.615 --> 19:44.270
everything that happened
yesterday.

19:44.357 --> 19:46.054
Of course.

19:46.141 --> 19:48.274
Yeah, I have that.
Okay. Sure.

19:50.145 --> 19:51.407
This is Cho.

19:51.494 --> 19:53.192
It's Summer.

19:56.717 --> 19:58.240
Hey.

19:58.327 --> 20:00.895
I just wanted to apologize
for making you late.

20:00.982 --> 20:03.202
It's okay. You were only
trying to help.

20:03.289 --> 20:05.160
How can I make it
up to you?

20:05.247 --> 20:07.554
[chuckles]
I'm sure you'll
think of something.

20:07.641 --> 20:09.686
Hey, Cho.

20:09.773 --> 20:11.079
I gotta go.
I'll call you later.

20:11.166 --> 20:12.123
Okay.

20:14.343 --> 20:16.389
That was Agua Blanca PD.
They found the victim's car.

20:16.476 --> 20:18.042
It was about a block away
from that banquet hall

20:18.129 --> 20:19.435
where Aden gave us the slip.

20:19.522 --> 20:21.132
Well, Braddock's last phone call
was to Aden.

20:21.220 --> 20:23.831
So maybe father and son had a
reunion that didn't go so well.

20:23.918 --> 20:26.137
Wouldn't be surprised.
I talked to the estate lawyer.

20:26.225 --> 20:27.791
Most of Braddock's money
was split into trusts

20:27.878 --> 20:30.359
for Liesl and Aden, payable
on their 23rd birthdays.

20:30.446 --> 20:32.405
Sounds normal.
Rich normal, anyway.

20:32.492 --> 20:34.450
Yeah, but in light
of his son's drug problems

20:34.537 --> 20:35.712
Braddock was in
the process of changing

20:35.799 --> 20:38.237
the age of Aden's trust
from 23 to 30.

20:38.324 --> 20:40.239
So Aden confronts Braddock.

20:40.326 --> 20:41.805
Argument breaks out.

20:41.892 --> 20:43.720
Aden chokes dad
and buries the body.

20:43.807 --> 20:47.115
- We need to find that kid.
- Yeah.

20:47.202 --> 20:50.466
Rigsby, can you hold?

20:50.553 --> 20:51.946
Well, he has to collect
his pay, right?

20:52.033 --> 20:53.426
Why don't we stake out
the banquet hall?

20:53.513 --> 20:55.123
Aden was a part-timer,
minimum wage.

20:55.210 --> 20:57.125
He's not gonna risk getting
caught for that paycheck.

20:57.212 --> 20:58.561
Can we track
his cell phone?

20:58.648 --> 21:00.041
Tried. It's powered off.

21:00.128 --> 21:01.608
What about the lottery scam?

21:01.695 --> 21:05.133
I don't know. I think
he's too smart for that.

21:05.220 --> 21:07.875
Hey, who's this?
Sorry to keep you waiting.

21:07.962 --> 21:09.093
Aden Braddock?

21:09.180 --> 21:11.922
Uh, yeah.
Sure, you can.

21:12.009 --> 21:13.837
Yeah, you can come in
and talk to us.

21:13.924 --> 21:14.882
Let me give you the address.

21:17.580 --> 21:18.581
Why'd you run, Aden?

21:18.668 --> 21:21.018
I don't know.

21:21.105 --> 21:25.066
[exhales]
Okay, I do. I was carrying
drugs, okay?

21:25.153 --> 21:28.112
I couldn't get popped again. It
would have been my third strike.

21:28.199 --> 21:30.811
So instead you'll be
charged with obstruction.

21:30.898 --> 21:33.292
- A felony offense.
- I wasn't thinking straight.

21:33.379 --> 21:36.120
I'd just found out
my father was killed.

21:36.207 --> 21:38.253
Liesl called me.

21:38.340 --> 21:41.212
Look.

21:41.300 --> 21:42.779
I need you
to come clean with me.

21:42.866 --> 21:45.304
When was the last time
you talked to your father?

21:45.391 --> 21:47.131
I don't know. Months?

21:47.218 --> 21:49.743
Okay, look.

21:49.830 --> 21:52.267
We're getting off
to a bad start here.

21:52.354 --> 21:54.574
He called you
at 7:45 last night.

21:57.054 --> 21:59.622
[Archer Braddock]
Hey, kiddo, it's dad.
It's been a while.

21:59.709 --> 22:02.277
I didn't wanna hear it.

22:02.364 --> 22:03.757
You said "Talk to."

22:03.844 --> 22:05.802
That's a message
and I didn't wanna hear it.

22:05.889 --> 22:07.543
You know whose car was found
a block away from your job?

22:07.630 --> 22:09.458
I wasn't working last night.
Ask anybody.

22:09.545 --> 22:10.851
Well, maybe he thought
youwereworking

22:10.938 --> 22:12.069
and someone followed him.

22:12.156 --> 22:14.681
Who might that be?

22:14.768 --> 22:16.726
Oh, no.

22:21.209 --> 22:22.863
- I have this friend.
- Friend?

22:22.950 --> 22:25.256
Dealer.
Mike Tran.

22:25.344 --> 22:26.388
Lately, he's been
asking a lot of questions

22:26.475 --> 22:28.608
about my dad, like..

22:28.695 --> 22:30.349
...how much he's worth
and what kind of cars he sells.

22:30.436 --> 22:33.221
- And you told him?
- Why wouldn't I?

22:33.308 --> 22:36.093
I hated my father.

22:36.180 --> 22:38.444
He cut me off and..

22:38.531 --> 22:39.445
...yeah.

22:39.532 --> 22:41.751
I'm not talking about money.

22:43.884 --> 22:45.364
He left me.

22:50.543 --> 22:52.936
[instrumental music]

22:53.023 --> 22:55.896
No sign of Tran.
Cho?

22:55.983 --> 22:58.246
'How's it looking back there?'

23:01.684 --> 23:04.208
I got nothing
going on back here.

23:04.295 --> 23:07.168
Aden's dealer's
a nasty piece of business.

23:07.255 --> 23:09.562
Two charges aggravated assault

23:09.649 --> 23:11.564
intent to distribute meth

23:11.651 --> 23:13.914
and he choked out
a probation officer.

23:14.001 --> 23:15.742
It's worth checking out.

23:17.874 --> 23:19.833
You sure he'll be here?

23:19.920 --> 23:23.793
His baby-mother says he was
dropping off some money today.

23:23.880 --> 23:25.273
He can be your role model.

23:25.360 --> 23:26.317
[scoffs]

23:33.803 --> 23:36.676
Did you know your husband
was seeing Brother Josef?

23:36.763 --> 23:39.156
Archer's cancer made him..

23:39.243 --> 23:41.158
...a target for
quite a few con men

23:41.245 --> 23:42.943
'and alternative remedies.'

23:43.030 --> 23:45.119
Why didn't you tell us?

23:45.206 --> 23:48.905
Forgive me for trying
to maintain a man's dignity.

23:48.992 --> 23:50.603
We have a cancer
charity in our name

23:50.690 --> 23:52.431
that we've raised
a lot of money for.

23:52.518 --> 23:54.998
Did you know that
he was getting better?

23:55.085 --> 23:56.347
Yeah.

23:56.435 --> 23:57.653
The same way
he was getting better

23:57.740 --> 23:59.916
after the oxygen therapy
in Germany

24:00.003 --> 24:03.877
or the psychic surgery
in Brazil.

24:03.964 --> 24:06.836
It was a constant
roller coaster ride with Archer.

24:14.235 --> 24:17.847
Chemo, huh?
Kills the appetite.

24:17.934 --> 24:20.807
- How about a spot of tea?
- Oh, that sounds lovely.

24:21.590 --> 24:23.374
You got it.

24:26.769 --> 24:29.642
[instrumental music]

24:34.560 --> 24:37.519
Suspect has arrived.
Time to move.

24:49.444 --> 24:51.272
Cho?
You copy?

24:51.359 --> 24:54.275
[glass shattering]

24:54.362 --> 24:57.496
Sounds like a fight.
I'm going in.

24:58.584 --> 24:59.976
Go! Go!

25:02.413 --> 25:03.371
Go!

25:03.458 --> 25:05.112
Police!

25:05.199 --> 25:06.722
[crying]

25:06.809 --> 25:08.942
You're safe.
It's okay.

25:09.029 --> 25:11.074
Is he there?

25:11.161 --> 25:13.120
[gunshot]

25:13.207 --> 25:15.252
[grunting]

25:15.339 --> 25:17.428
[gunshot]

25:17.516 --> 25:18.429
[Kimball Cho]
'Stay down!'

25:23.957 --> 25:25.741
Weapon's secure.

25:25.828 --> 25:27.264
- You good?
- Yeah.

25:29.049 --> 25:30.267
[Kimball Cho]
'Get up.'

25:33.575 --> 25:35.316
Guess it was my lucky day.

25:44.934 --> 25:47.371
Mrs. Braddock is still
upstairs waiting for her tea.

25:47.458 --> 25:49.069
What are you doing?

25:49.156 --> 25:52.551
Oh, just, uh, enjoying
the calm before the storm.

25:52.638 --> 25:54.117
You only made
one cup of tea.

25:54.204 --> 25:57.556
Mm. I needed to keep
those tea bags dry.

25:57.643 --> 26:00.820
I'm not gonna like this, am I?

26:00.907 --> 26:03.605
You're gonna love it.

26:10.351 --> 26:11.439
[Lisbon]
'Oh, ho!'

26:13.484 --> 26:16.400
[instrumental music]

26:42.252 --> 26:44.951
You may wanna cover your ears.

26:47.301 --> 26:50.217
[beeping]

26:56.266 --> 26:58.442
Liesl!

26:58.529 --> 26:59.705
Liesl!

26:59.792 --> 27:01.707
Somebody help me!

27:03.970 --> 27:05.232
Showtime.

27:06.407 --> 27:09.323
[beeping]

27:11.151 --> 27:12.892
Fire!

27:15.285 --> 27:17.940
She moves pretty good
for a cancer patient.

27:18.027 --> 27:19.550
Oh, it's a miracle.

27:19.638 --> 27:22.118
Sister Helen has been healed!

27:22.205 --> 27:23.903
Ma'am!

27:23.990 --> 27:25.861
Ma'am!

27:30.213 --> 27:32.128
What kind of woman fakes cancer?

27:32.215 --> 27:34.914
Lots of women go to
extremes to meet men.

27:35.001 --> 27:38.787
Extremes, yes.
Cancer support groups, no.

27:38.874 --> 27:41.877
I was lucky to have Archer
for the time that I did.

27:41.964 --> 27:45.576
He opened doors in me that
I didn't even know existed.

27:45.664 --> 27:48.449
He was caring,
generous, spiritual.

27:48.536 --> 27:51.670
Rich...and dying fast.

27:52.409 --> 27:54.020
The perfect man.

27:54.107 --> 27:57.327
How did you know?
That I didn't have cancer?

27:57.414 --> 27:59.721
Well, you lacked a..

28:01.505 --> 28:03.899
'...an air of finality.'

28:03.986 --> 28:05.422
Plus you shaved your head

28:05.509 --> 28:07.337
but your vanity prevented you

28:07.424 --> 28:09.818
from losing the eyebrows.

28:09.905 --> 28:11.820
Devil's in the details.

28:14.170 --> 28:16.956
Braddock's insurance policy.

28:17.043 --> 28:20.524
It was recently changed
to add a new beneficiary.

28:20.611 --> 28:23.179
- You.
- I didn't kill Archer.

28:23.266 --> 28:26.139
You had 5 million reasons
to want him dead.

28:26.226 --> 28:29.011
Archer had a month left, maybe.

28:29.098 --> 28:32.014
Why would I risk losing all
of that money to take his life?

28:32.101 --> 28:34.538
I don't know.
Doyou?

28:34.625 --> 28:36.410
She's telling the truth.
You can go.

28:36.497 --> 28:38.194
- No. She can't.
- You can't.

28:38.281 --> 28:40.109
- Why not?
- I'm charging you with fraud.

28:40.196 --> 28:41.676
What?

28:41.763 --> 28:44.113
You're not gonna see a dime
of that insurance money.

28:44.200 --> 28:46.420
And your face is gonna be
plastered all over the news.

28:46.507 --> 28:48.074
But at least
you'll have your eyebrows.

28:48.161 --> 28:50.293
Let's see how many
dates you get then.

28:50.380 --> 28:52.339
Yeah.

28:52.426 --> 28:53.949
- Do you feel better?
- I do.

28:54.036 --> 28:55.908
Yeah, good.
Now it's my turn.

28:55.995 --> 28:57.431
I have a plan
to catch our killer.

28:57.518 --> 28:59.520
Can't wait to hear that.

28:59.607 --> 29:02.523
[instrumental music]

29:16.276 --> 29:18.234
He looks so thin..

29:21.760 --> 29:23.457
...fragile.

29:23.544 --> 29:24.893
When was the last time
you saw him?

29:24.980 --> 29:26.373
A year ago.

29:26.460 --> 29:28.723
When he told us
about the diagnosis.

29:30.681 --> 29:33.772
It ended with us fighting
and Liesl crying.

29:37.253 --> 29:39.560
How does that happen?

29:39.647 --> 29:41.170
Ran down Tran's alibi.

29:41.257 --> 29:43.433
But he was 40 miles away
when your father was killed.

29:43.520 --> 29:45.740
- So Tran didn't do it?
- No.

29:45.827 --> 29:47.307
But we do have a suspect.

29:47.394 --> 29:49.570
One whose alibi doesn't hold up.

29:49.657 --> 29:51.659
Does the name
"Dolores" ring any bells?

29:51.746 --> 29:53.269
The waitress
at the banquet hall?

29:53.356 --> 29:55.010
[Rigsby]
'You told me you weren't
at work last night'

29:55.097 --> 29:56.490
but Dolores says
you stopped by around eight

29:56.577 --> 29:58.274
to borrow some money.

29:58.361 --> 29:59.667
- You lied.
- No, I didn't.

29:59.754 --> 30:01.495
I told you I wasn't working.

30:01.582 --> 30:03.149
I didn't say
I wasn't at work.

30:03.236 --> 30:06.195
You know, it's all lies
and half-truths with you.

30:06.282 --> 30:07.718
How are we supposed to
know what to believe?

30:07.806 --> 30:11.070
Look, I needed money
for the drugs, okay?

30:11.157 --> 30:13.115
And I needed drugs
after I saw that my dad called.

30:13.202 --> 30:16.162
He had this way of
making me feel so small.

30:16.249 --> 30:17.685
Not anymore.

30:19.469 --> 30:21.471
I didn't kill him.

30:23.169 --> 30:25.519
- You have to believe me.
- No, we don't.

30:25.606 --> 30:26.825
Give me your hands.

30:34.310 --> 30:36.312
Science never sleeps
around here, does it?

30:38.140 --> 30:40.577
Mr. Jane,
how may I help you?

30:40.664 --> 30:43.972
Well, I don't need
your services...thankfully.

30:44.059 --> 30:45.234
Even if I did,
I'm not sure

30:45.321 --> 30:47.280
this is the first place,
I'd come.

30:47.367 --> 30:49.151
I met this fellow,
Brother Josef

30:49.238 --> 30:52.676
who can, uh, totally
eradicate bone cancer.

30:52.763 --> 30:54.200
Really? How so?

30:54.287 --> 30:56.115
The power of positive thinking.

30:56.202 --> 30:57.290
Naturally.

30:57.377 --> 30:59.248
That's right, naturally.

30:59.335 --> 31:01.511
No drugs whatsoever.

31:01.598 --> 31:04.471
That's how
he cured Archer Braddock.

31:04.558 --> 31:07.866
- Is that what this man claims?
- Yeah.

31:07.953 --> 31:08.954
Betsy, pull up
Braddock's file.

31:09.041 --> 31:10.346
Uh, certainly.

31:10.433 --> 31:11.957
'Let me show you
something, Mr. Jane.'

31:14.089 --> 31:16.439
This is Braddock's last MRI,
taken two weeks ago.

31:16.526 --> 31:18.006
You see all those white spots?

31:18.093 --> 31:20.879
- Yeah, looks like a snowstorm.
- It's cancer.

31:20.966 --> 31:23.490
It spread from his bones and was
working its way to his lungs.

31:23.577 --> 31:25.231
He had five weeks, max.

31:25.318 --> 31:26.493
Oh, this was taken
two weeks ago.

31:26.580 --> 31:28.669
Maybe that cancer's cleared up.

31:28.756 --> 31:30.758
The mind is
a very powerful tool.

31:30.845 --> 31:31.977
Well, I'm happy to
show you personally

31:32.064 --> 31:33.717
when I'm granted
access to the body.

31:33.804 --> 31:35.110
Where are we at
with my request?

31:35.197 --> 31:37.199
Oh, I still can't
reach the coroner.

31:37.286 --> 31:40.463
Everyone wants to look
inside that body.

31:40.550 --> 31:42.465
Brother Josef
had the same request.

31:42.552 --> 31:43.858
Did you approve it?

31:43.945 --> 31:45.077
Well, I'll tell you what
I told Brother Josef.

31:45.164 --> 31:47.035
It's out of my hands.

31:47.122 --> 31:49.255
But my boss has called in
a forensic pathologist

31:49.342 --> 31:50.560
from Sacramento.

31:50.647 --> 31:52.345
He'll be performing
a full autopsy

31:52.432 --> 31:53.607
first thing in
the morning.

31:53.694 --> 31:55.000
I'll let you know
what he finds.

31:55.087 --> 31:56.392
Well..

32:08.361 --> 32:10.189
Oh, hey.

32:10.276 --> 32:11.755
I wanted to, uh, show you this.

32:11.842 --> 32:13.409
We need to talk about
what happened today.

32:13.496 --> 32:16.238
I was late covering
your back. I'm sorry.

32:16.325 --> 32:18.762
- You're sorry?
- It won't happen again.

32:18.849 --> 32:21.330
Cho, you saved my life.

32:23.942 --> 32:26.292
You were there
when I needed you.

32:26.379 --> 32:28.381
I owe you...big time.

32:29.773 --> 32:31.732
No.

32:31.819 --> 32:33.429
You don't owe me anything.

32:35.170 --> 32:36.563
Okay.

32:44.310 --> 32:45.615
This is too creepy.

32:45.702 --> 32:47.661
Killers like creepy.

32:47.748 --> 32:49.663
I can't feel my feet.
They're freezing.

32:49.750 --> 32:51.012
Be patient.

32:52.840 --> 32:54.581
Has it ever occurred to you that
maybe your theory was wrong?

32:54.668 --> 32:56.409
Nope.

32:56.496 --> 32:57.932
Braddock's killer buried him
because there was something

32:58.019 --> 32:59.368
about the body,
he didn't want people to know.

32:59.455 --> 33:01.544
So if we put out
the word of an autopsy

33:01.631 --> 33:04.286
then we force the killer
to try again.

33:04.373 --> 33:06.462
If we don't die
of frostbite first.

33:06.549 --> 33:08.160
Can you wiggle your toes?

33:08.247 --> 33:10.075
Because if you can wiggle
your toes, you're fine.

33:10.162 --> 33:11.206
- I can't move them--
- Shh. Shh.

33:11.293 --> 33:13.208
Someone is comin'.

33:17.821 --> 33:19.127
Oh!

33:19.214 --> 33:21.956
Surprise, surprise.

33:29.181 --> 33:31.922
You're under arrest for
the murder of Archer Braddock.

33:32.010 --> 33:34.838
What's going on?
I didn't killArcher!

33:34.925 --> 33:36.536
Then why were you
tryin' to steal his body?

33:36.623 --> 33:37.928
I'm not stealing him, either.

33:38.016 --> 33:40.540
I told you, I need
to perform a ritual

33:40.627 --> 33:44.413
to release the bad energy before
his journey to the afterlife.

33:44.500 --> 33:47.590
There was something inside
Braddock, wasn't there?

33:47.677 --> 33:49.244
Something that would
lead directly to you

33:49.331 --> 33:50.898
if the coroner
discovered it.

33:50.985 --> 33:52.639
You never did share
the proprietary blend

33:52.726 --> 33:55.511
of that stinky special
tea of yours, did you?

33:55.598 --> 33:57.252
The tea of clarity?

33:57.339 --> 33:58.906
It was killing him
quicker than the cancer.

33:58.993 --> 34:00.603
That's why
you stopped selling it.

34:00.690 --> 34:02.649
Oh, please. You're making
a terrible mistake.

34:02.736 --> 34:05.347
So you say, Brother Josef.

34:05.434 --> 34:08.176
At least let me
release his spirit.

34:08.263 --> 34:10.309
Let me do that for him, please.

34:10.396 --> 34:12.441
Let's go.
Hands behind your back.

34:18.969 --> 34:21.842
So the amount of radiation
released from a solar flare

34:21.929 --> 34:23.191
can damage satellites?

34:23.278 --> 34:24.932
It's way, way more powerful

34:25.019 --> 34:28.457
than the radiation therapy
used to treat cancer.

34:28.544 --> 34:29.676
Did you know this, Lisbon?

34:29.763 --> 34:31.460
- Fascinating.
- Now, listen.

34:31.547 --> 34:33.723
Aren't I allowed a-a, uh,
a phone call or something?

34:33.810 --> 34:34.768
In a minute.
Sit down.

34:34.855 --> 34:36.161
[cellphone ringing]

34:36.248 --> 34:38.119
Excuse me.

34:38.206 --> 34:40.295
Lisbon.

34:40.382 --> 34:41.340
Are you sure?

34:43.168 --> 34:46.562
No. No, we didn't take it.

34:46.649 --> 34:48.564
We'll be right there.
Get everybody out of that room.

34:48.651 --> 34:50.218
It's a crime scene now.

34:52.873 --> 34:55.441
Braddock's body is
missing from the morgue.

34:55.528 --> 34:57.921
They think somebody
stole it after we left.

34:58.008 --> 34:59.662
Oh, dear.

34:59.749 --> 35:01.316
He was right about one thing.

35:01.403 --> 35:04.102
We just made a terrible mistake.

35:04.189 --> 35:07.105
[instrumental music]

35:16.244 --> 35:19.117
No sign of the killer
or Braddock's body.

35:19.204 --> 35:21.206
Whoever took it won't make
the same mistake twice.

35:21.293 --> 35:23.164
They'll want to destroy
the body...quickly.

35:23.251 --> 35:24.600
How would you do
that in Agua Blanca?

35:24.687 --> 35:26.080
I can think of one way.

35:26.167 --> 35:28.343
Please tell me it doesn't
involve feeding tigers.

35:28.430 --> 35:29.953
Tigers leave bones.

35:30.040 --> 35:31.955
There is a more thorough option.

35:34.828 --> 35:37.787
[Lisbon]
'I hope
you're right about this.'

35:37.874 --> 35:39.572
Look at this clinic.

35:39.659 --> 35:41.835
Very well funded.

35:41.922 --> 35:43.967
Scheck's ego would require
that he has the best.

35:44.054 --> 35:45.708
'I tell you, this guy'

35:45.795 --> 35:48.146
is gonna have a top of
the line medical incinerator.

35:49.843 --> 35:51.714
In the basement?

35:51.801 --> 35:54.021
Can we use inside
voices, please?

35:57.067 --> 35:59.983
[instrumental music]

36:06.686 --> 36:07.687
Police!

36:07.774 --> 36:11.169
Drop the...weapon.

36:11.256 --> 36:12.909
Better late than never,
I suppose.

36:12.996 --> 36:16.086
Hands in the air!

36:16.174 --> 36:18.654
Your hands, not his.

36:18.741 --> 36:19.786
[Jane]
'Oh!'

36:24.617 --> 36:27.402
Did you act alone?

36:27.489 --> 36:29.839
Did Dr. Scheck have
anything to do with this?

36:29.926 --> 36:30.884
No.

36:30.971 --> 36:32.538
He'd never pull off..

36:35.628 --> 36:37.107
...never mind.

36:37.195 --> 36:40.763
It'll go a lot easier
if you just come clean.

36:42.243 --> 36:43.766
We looked at
your bank statements.

36:43.853 --> 36:46.900
You're very wealthy
for a nurse.

36:46.987 --> 36:50.251
Cancer survivors are often
grateful to their caregivers.

36:50.338 --> 36:52.471
You took bribes, didn't you?

36:54.690 --> 36:56.214
Cancer studies
are like lotteries

36:56.301 --> 36:59.391
and you were selling
the winning tickets.

36:59.478 --> 37:03.003
- You were selling hope.
- It's cheap at the price.

37:03.090 --> 37:05.788
Why were you trying to
destroy Archer Braddock's body?

37:07.268 --> 37:09.052
His liver was damaged.

37:09.923 --> 37:11.359
Alcoholism.

37:12.795 --> 37:13.970
And you missed it.

37:17.626 --> 37:20.281
Oh, we thought Brother Josef
was poisoning him with his tea

37:20.368 --> 37:23.806
when in fact
it was your drug.

37:23.893 --> 37:25.939
Because of the liver damage,
it was killing him

37:26.026 --> 37:27.767
faster than the cancer.

37:30.248 --> 37:32.206
I knew Dr. Scheck would find out

37:32.293 --> 37:34.252
in his postmortem exam.

37:36.079 --> 37:39.518
And then there would be
a whole investigation.

37:39.605 --> 37:42.521
And...they'd have
found out about..

37:42.608 --> 37:46.002
...about the gifts
I received from patients.

37:47.177 --> 37:48.440
I had to do something.

37:48.527 --> 37:50.180
So you went to
the banquet hall that night.

37:50.268 --> 37:51.617
You followed him there.

37:51.704 --> 37:54.097
He was gonna die anyway..

37:54.184 --> 37:55.882
...of bone cancer.

37:57.318 --> 38:00.147
Do you know
how agonizing that is?

38:00.234 --> 38:03.193
Excruciatingly slow and painful.

38:07.502 --> 38:09.374
[crackling]

38:09.461 --> 38:11.463
[Betsy]
I made his passing easy.

38:11.550 --> 38:14.161
A little chloroform
before I suffocated him

38:15.118 --> 38:16.990
he never felt a thing.

38:18.034 --> 38:20.123
I ended his suffering.

38:21.429 --> 38:23.388
It was an act
of kindness, really.

38:23.475 --> 38:26.869
I think Mr. Braddock and his
children would beg to differ.

38:31.918 --> 38:32.832
[Van Pelt]
'What you got there?'

38:32.919 --> 38:35.748
Huh.
It's my kid.

38:37.010 --> 38:39.360
- So big so fast.
- Mm.

38:39.447 --> 38:40.840
Only a couple weeks to go.

38:42.798 --> 38:46.628
I heard about today.
Are you okay?

38:46.715 --> 38:49.196
Yeah.

38:49.283 --> 38:50.719
You know,
when that guy shot at me

38:50.806 --> 38:52.068
all I could think about
was how I gotta make it out

38:52.155 --> 38:54.375
to see my son.

38:54.462 --> 38:56.334
It's crazy.

38:56.421 --> 38:58.379
You know, if I'd died a year ago

38:58.466 --> 38:59.380
it wouldn't have
mattered so much

38:59.467 --> 39:01.426
in the big scheme of things.

39:01.513 --> 39:04.864
- It would have mattered to me.
- Yeah.

39:04.951 --> 39:08.041
Not as much as it would
have mattered to him.

39:08.128 --> 39:10.086
He's a game changer.

39:14.308 --> 39:16.310
He's a lucky kid.

39:28.670 --> 39:30.280
Here we go.

39:30.368 --> 39:31.934
What's this for?

39:32.021 --> 39:35.024
Well, to let you know what
a proper cup of tea smells like

39:35.111 --> 39:36.591
before you go out
into the world.

39:38.463 --> 39:40.856
Brother Josef really did
a number on my dad, huh?

39:42.467 --> 39:43.642
Oh, I don't know.

39:43.729 --> 39:45.948
He gave him hope.

39:46.035 --> 39:47.297
No better way
to stimulate the body

39:47.385 --> 39:49.691
than the promise of a new day.

39:49.778 --> 39:53.434
And Helen?
I still can't believe that.

39:53.521 --> 39:55.654
I did a cancer walk
for that bitch.

39:55.741 --> 39:57.177
Language.

39:57.264 --> 39:59.919
Liesl?

40:00.006 --> 40:01.486
Aden?

40:04.489 --> 40:07.143
I-I talked to Aunt Marcia and..

40:07.230 --> 40:09.058
...I wanna move back home.

40:09.145 --> 40:11.583
- Okay.
- After rehab.

40:11.670 --> 40:14.107
Who talked you into that?

40:14.194 --> 40:15.413
Dad.

40:17.806 --> 40:20.113
[Archer Braddock]
Hey, kiddo, it's dad.
It's been a while.

40:20.200 --> 40:24.073
Look, I'm outside your job.
I made a mistake.

40:24.160 --> 40:26.075
I want you to come home.

40:26.162 --> 40:27.860
Whatever time I have left

40:27.947 --> 40:30.471
I wanna spend
with you and Liesl.

40:30.558 --> 40:32.473
I love you both so much.

40:32.560 --> 40:35.476
Okay. See you soon, I hope.

40:35.563 --> 40:37.391
Here goes.

40:37.478 --> 40:39.306
Come on, let's go home.

40:41.395 --> 40:42.962
Mr. Jane?

40:45.268 --> 40:46.574
Thanks.

40:52.406 --> 40:55.365
- Boss, you have a minute?
- Sure.

40:55.453 --> 40:58.847
I heard about you and Rigsby
with the drug dealer earlier.

40:58.934 --> 41:00.936
Nice work.

41:05.680 --> 41:07.073
Is everything alright?

41:07.160 --> 41:08.596
No.

41:10.903 --> 41:12.382
This is a safe room.

41:12.470 --> 41:14.907
You can talk about
whatever you'd like here.

41:16.865 --> 41:19.564
Okay.

41:19.651 --> 41:22.523
[instrumental music]

41:30.749 --> 41:33.926
I'm sorry,
I was late this morning.

41:34.013 --> 41:36.015
I'll make sure
it never happens again.

41:36.102 --> 41:37.364
Okay.

41:38.452 --> 41:40.585
Goodnight, boss.

41:40.672 --> 41:43.544
[instrumental music]

42:03.695 --> 42:06.567
[music continues]

42:19.362 --> 42:20.625
[toilet flushes]

42:33.246 --> 42:35.509
[theme music]
