DID PRETTY GOOD

03:35.667 --> 03:37.432
FOR A FIRST RACE,
HUH, MR. MACHADO?

03:37.467 --> 03:39.232
I THOUGHT SHE'D SHOW
A LITTLE MORE THAN THAT.

03:39.267 --> 03:40.699
MAYBE SHE NEEDS
A BETTER JOCKEY.

03:40.734 --> 03:41.898
OH, HERE WE GO!

03:41.934 --> 03:43.632
COME ON,
MR. MACHADO,
I'M READY.

03:43.667 --> 03:45.965
YOU KNOW I AM.
LET ME BE
YOUR JOCKEY.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.532
I'M NOT PUTTING YOU
ON A RACEHORSE.
IT'S TOO DANGEROUS.

03:48.567 --> 03:49.965
I'VE SHOVELED
HORSE POOP FOR YOU

03:50.000 --> 03:51.965
FOR THE PAST 2
YEARS. TRUST ME,

03:52.000 --> 04:02.098
DANGEROUS IS
A BIG STEP UP.

04:02.134 --> 04:04.299
WITH A LITTLE REST,
SHE'LL BE FINE.

04:04.334 --> 04:06.165
YEAH. WILL SHE
RACE AGAIN?

04:06.201 --> 04:08.032
NO, BUT MAYBE
A RIDING PONY--

04:08.067 --> 04:11.765
I DON'T DO RIDING
PONIES. I DO
RACE HORSES.

04:11.801 --> 04:14.432
JUST GET ME
THE INJURY
CERTIFICATE.

04:14.467 --> 04:16.232
TELL YOU WHAT.
WHY DON'T YOU
ASK YOUR MOTHER

04:16.267 --> 04:17.232
AND SEE WHAT
SHE SAYS.

04:17.267 --> 04:22.699
YOU KNOW WHAT
SHE'LL SAY!

04:22.734 --> 04:24.765
LUCY, WHAT WAS
THAT ALL ABOUT?

04:24.801 --> 04:27.098
GARRIS WANTS
TO PUT HER DOWN.

04:27.134 --> 04:29.498
NOW LET ME GUESS--
INSURANCE MONEY.

04:29.534 --> 04:32.332
AN ANIMAL LIKE THIS...
WHAT A WASTE.

04:32.367 --> 04:36.032
SHE IS A BEAUTY.

04:36.067 --> 04:37.632
YOU CAN TELL
MR. GARRIS

04:37.667 --> 04:38.632
I'M NOT
GETTING ON

04:38.667 --> 04:40.132
THAT PLUG
THUNDERJAM
AGAIN.

04:40.167 --> 04:42.498
I WAS
A LAUGHING-STOCK
OUT THERE!

04:42.534 --> 04:46.332
THUNDERJAM,
YOU'RE PATHETIC!

04:46.367 --> 04:48.365
Handler: WAIT A SECOND!
YOU CAN'T JUST WALK OUT

04:48.400 --> 04:51.765
ON MR. GARRIS
LIKE THAT!

04:51.801 --> 04:59.098
I'LL BE
RIGHT BACK.

04:59.134 --> 05:00.832
OH, THUNDERJAM.

05:00.867 --> 05:02.799
SO YOU HAD
A BAD START.

05:02.834 --> 05:07.032
YOU FINISHED GREAT.

05:07.067 --> 05:08.832
RIGHT THERE
AT THE TURN,

05:08.867 --> 05:10.498
WHEN YOU FLEW POST
THE QUARTER POLE.

05:10.534 --> 05:11.799
IT WAS LIKE...

05:11.834 --> 05:15.632
IT WAS LIKE
LISTENING TO
THE WIND.

05:15.667 --> 05:17.299
I THINK WHAT YOU MIGHT
HAVE HEARD WAS WHEEZING.

05:17.334 --> 05:18.365
NOW, MAYBE
YOU MISSED IT,

05:18.400 --> 05:21.299
BUT THIS, UH, THIS HORSE
CAME IN DEAD LAST.

05:21.334 --> 05:22.998
CORRECTION,
NEXT TO DEAD LAST.

05:23.034 --> 05:25.732
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.
MY APOLOGIES. YEAH,

05:25.767 --> 05:28.232
YOU DID BEAT THE HORSE
THAT FELL DOWN.

05:28.267 --> 05:31.165
OK, SO HE'S NOT
SECRETARIAT,

05:31.201 --> 05:34.232
BUT LOOK HOW STRONG
HE IS. YEAH!

05:34.267 --> 05:36.632
A HORSE NEEDS MORE
THAN STRENGTH, CORRIE.

05:36.667 --> 05:37.865
HE'S GOTTA HAVE HEART.

05:37.900 --> 05:40.965
I'LL BET
THERE'S A RACEHORSE
IN THERE SOMEWHERE.

05:41.000 --> 05:50.165
[NEIGHING EXCITEDLY]

05:50.201 --> 05:52.865
SO WHAT'S GOING
TO HAPPEN TO HER?

05:52.900 --> 05:54.565
OH, I WOULDN'T WORRY
ABOUT THAT.

05:54.600 --> 05:56.465
WE GOT ENOUGH PROBLEMS
IN OUR OWN BARN.

05:56.500 --> 05:58.465
I'M NOT A BABY,
MR. MACHADO.

05:58.500 --> 06:00.065
ALL RIGHT.

06:00.100 --> 06:02.365
GARRIS IS GONNA
HAVE HER DESTROYED.

06:02.400 --> 06:03.398
FOR WHAT?!

06:03.434 --> 06:06.432
FOR WHAT ELSE? MONEY.

06:06.467 --> 06:10.165
INSURANCE WON'T
PAY FOR A HORSE
THAT'S STILL STANDING.

06:10.201 --> 06:12.032
SO TOMORROW MORNING,
A TRUCK'LL COME BY,

06:12.067 --> 06:13.965
PICK HER UP,
TAKE HER AWAY...

06:14.000 --> 06:15.232
AND CUT HER UP
FOR HORSE MEAT.

06:15.267 --> 06:17.032
THERE'S GOTTA BE
SOMETHING
WE CAN DO.

06:17.067 --> 06:18.965
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA,
WHOA, CORRIE...

06:19.000 --> 06:25.032
IT'S NOT OUR HORSE.

06:25.067 --> 06:28.098
MAYBE...MAYBE
IT'LL GROW WINGS
AND FLY AWAY.

06:28.134 --> 06:29.965
YEAH, LIKE THAT'LL
HAPPEN.

06:30.000 --> 06:31.699
WELL, WE CAN
HOPE.

06:31.734 --> 06:34.032
ALL RIGHT. YOU
GO ON HOME NOW,
ALL RIGHT?

06:34.067 --> 06:37.365
YOUR MOTHER
PROBABLY HAS
DINNER WAITING.

06:37.400 --> 06:38.732
HERE YOU GO.

06:38.767 --> 06:41.032
I'LL PUT
WOOKIE'S COOKIE
BACK IN OUR BARN.

06:41.067 --> 06:42.632

YAH, YAH, GO!

07:14.934 --> 07:17.765
GABBY, TELL ME THAT IS NOT
MY UNDERWEAR ON YOUR HEAD.

07:17.801 --> 07:20.232
I'M PLAYING JOCKEY.
I NEEDED A HELMET.

07:20.267 --> 07:21.898
YOU NEED
A ROLE MODEL.

07:21.934 --> 07:23.199
BETTING WITH TOOTHPICKS,
<i>ABUELITA?</i>

07:23.234 --> 07:24.832
<i>iSALIO, SALIO!</i>

07:24.867 --> 07:27.765
ONLY THE FIFTH RACE,
AND ALREADY I'M DOWN
2,000.

07:27.801 --> 07:30.098
THAT'S A LOT OF
TOOTHPICKS.

07:30.134 --> 07:31.632
WASH UP,
CORRITA.

07:31.667 --> 07:36.032
DINNER'S
ALMOST READY.

07:36.067 --> 07:37.398
HEY! THAT'S
MY HAT!

07:37.434 --> 07:47.465
YOU COME--I'M GONNA
TELL MOM!

07:47.467 --> 08:11.065
YOU COME--I'M GONNA
TELL MOM!

08:11.100 --> 08:18.165
I WON'T LET YOU
DOWN, DAD.

08:18.201 --> 08:19.998
HOW WAS WORK TODAY,
CORRITA?

08:20.034 --> 08:21.665
SAME OLD THING.

08:21.701 --> 08:25.132
FEED THE HORSES,
WORK THE HORSES,
WATCH 'EM LOSE.

08:25.167 --> 08:27.498
HECTOR IS
A GOOD MAN.

08:27.534 --> 08:28.765
GOD WILL
REWARD HIM.

08:28.801 --> 08:30.365
HIS LUCK
WILL CHANGE.

08:30.400 --> 08:33.732
I'M A GOOD WOMAN.
MY LUCK STINKS.

08:33.767 --> 08:35.765
THAT'S BECAUSE
GOD REWARDED YOU

08:35.801 --> 08:36.965
WITH
GRANDCHILDREN.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.498
I WOULD TRADE THEM
FOR A WINNING HORSE.

08:39.534 --> 08:40.732
SHE'S TEASING
YOU, GABBY.

08:40.767 --> 08:42.332
I KNOW.

08:42.366 --> 08:44.131
HEY, PUT A LID
ON THE DISPOSAL.

08:44.167 --> 08:46.132
YOU CAN'T TELL ME
WHAT TO DO.

08:46.167 --> 08:48.232
I'M THE MAN OF
THE FAMILY.

08:48.267 --> 08:50.799
SAYS THE BOY WHO WEARS
SATIN PANTIES ON HIS HEAD.

08:50.834 --> 08:55.865
THE COTTON ONES
PULL MY HAIR.

08:55.900 --> 09:00.632
MOM, I'VE BEEN THINKING
ABOUT GETTING A NEW JOB.

09:00.667 --> 09:04.699
AND QUIT WORKING FOR
MR. MACHADO?

09:04.734 --> 09:08.232
I'D STILL BE
WORKING FOR HIM.

09:08.267 --> 09:10.299
HE NEEDS A NEW JOCKEY.

09:10.334 --> 09:12.565
I WON'T ALLOW IT.

09:12.600 --> 09:14.832
BUT, MOM, I DON'T
WANT TO BE

09:14.867 --> 09:16.732
AN EXERCISE RIDER
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.

09:16.767 --> 09:19.699
WELL, THEN YOU CAN
FORGET ABOUT
THE HORSES.

09:19.734 --> 09:22.132
YOU'RE A SMART GIRL,
CORRIE.

09:22.167 --> 09:24.799
YOU CAN BE
A DOCTOR...TEACHER.

09:24.834 --> 09:25.965
I DON'T WANT TO BE
THOSE THINGS.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.532
I WANT TO BE
A JOCKEY.

09:27.567 --> 09:28.565
WE HAVE BEEN
THROUGH THIS

09:28.600 --> 09:30.232
A THOUSAND TIMES,
CORRITA.

09:30.267 --> 09:32.398
I SAID NO,
AND THAT IS FINAL.

09:32.434 --> 09:34.699
I CAN BE ANYTHING
I WANNA BE.

09:34.734 --> 09:36.232
DAD TOLD ME SO.

09:36.267 --> 09:38.199
AND LOOK WHAT BEING
A JOCKEY GOT HIM.

09:38.234 --> 09:40.665
A NICE HEADSTONE.

09:40.701 --> 09:42.032
IS THAT
WHAT YOU WANT?

09:42.067 --> 09:48.965
TO BREAK
MY HEART AGAIN?

09:49.000 --> 09:50.299
GABBY,
GO WITH HER.

09:50.334 --> 09:55.865
OK.

09:55.900 --> 09:58.365
SHE REMINDS ME OF
HER FATHER.

09:58.400 --> 10:00.432
DON'T!

10:00.467 --> 10:02.432
SHE IS MY CHILD,

10:02.467 --> 10:03.965
AND I AM TRYING
TO PROTECT HER.

10:04.000 --> 10:06.898
FOR HOW LONG?

10:06.934 --> 10:11.232
WHAT IF SHE'S GOT
THE GIFT?

10:11.267 --> 10:13.832
NO GIFT...

10:13.867 --> 10:18.765
TAKES AWAY
A HUSBAND
AND A FATHER.

10:18.801 --> 10:28.832
THERE IS
NO GIFT!

10:28.834 --> 10:48.832
THERE IS
NO GIFT!

10:48.834 --> 11:08.832
THERE IS
NO GIFT!

11:08.834 --> 11:29.165
THERE IS
NO GIFT!

11:29.201 --> 11:30.565
[NEIGHS]

11:30.600 --> 11:33.632
Corrie: IT'S OK.

11:33.667 --> 11:38.365
I WON'T LET THEM
HURT YOU.
I PROMISE.

11:38.400 --> 11:48.432

12:16.667 --> 12:20.565
THIS IS FOR
YOUR OWN GOOD.

12:20.600 --> 12:23.732
