WEBVTT

00:03.211 --> 00:05.130
[Ray] All right, let's get this over with.

00:05.839 --> 00:09.592
[clears throat] This proceeding
and any sentences arising therefrom

00:09.676 --> 00:10.802
shall be conducted under

00:10.885 --> 00:13.179
the Federation Judicial Code,
Article Nine,

00:13.263 --> 00:17.267
in re-attempted murder and mutiny,
both capital offenses.

00:17.350 --> 00:20.687
Now, I know you've all been sworn,
and I have read your complaints.

00:20.770 --> 00:21.771
I have a question.

00:21.855 --> 00:23.773
Is it, "What's the best way
to interrupt a judge?"

00:23.857 --> 00:24.858
-[laughs] No.
-Then--

00:24.941 --> 00:26.609
It's, "Why does a spaceship

00:26.693 --> 00:29.529
have an enormous
dedicated courtroom in it?"

00:29.612 --> 00:30.864
Yeah, right?

00:30.947 --> 00:32.449
I don't know! I didn't build it.

00:32.532 --> 00:33.616
Well, it's ridiculous.

00:33.700 --> 00:36.786
I basically sleep in a coffin,
and this could have been...

00:37.495 --> 00:39.080
two and a half squash courts.

00:39.164 --> 00:41.207
Ooh, or a holodeck.

00:41.291 --> 00:43.001
We have a holodeck.

00:43.084 --> 00:44.836
-Yeah, but we never use it.
-Can we please--

00:44.919 --> 00:49.299
Oh, so hey, why not just have
the holodeck turn into a courtroom?

00:49.382 --> 00:51.509
Ooh, or two and a half squash courts.

00:51.593 --> 00:56.431
Order! Order, or I will hold you all
in a different kind of contempt. [grunts]

00:56.514 --> 01:00.685
Now, then, Mr. Figgis,
are the people ready to proceed?

01:00.769 --> 01:04.856
[laughs] Oh, yeah. [laughs]

01:05.607 --> 01:06.608
Uh...

01:07.567 --> 01:08.568
[clears throat]

01:08.651 --> 01:10.862
Oh, uh, sorry. Yes, Your Honor, the, uh--

01:10.945 --> 01:11.946
[clears throat]

01:12.030 --> 01:13.114
-What is--
-[Ray clears throat]

01:13.198 --> 01:14.699
Oh, come on, seriously?

01:15.366 --> 01:20.121
[sighs] Yes, Your Honor.
The people are ready to proceed.

01:20.205 --> 01:24.125
That's what I thought.
And is the defendant ready to proceed?

01:24.209 --> 01:27.921
No, the defendant is not
because there is no defendant

01:28.004 --> 01:31.174
because this whole thing
is a sham and a farce,

01:31.257 --> 01:34.052
and I don't recognize
this kangaroo court's authority

01:34.135 --> 01:36.805
because it's presided over
by a male prostitute.

01:36.888 --> 01:38.807
-Courtesan!
-Pobobot!

01:39.557 --> 01:44.562
And by God, you will recognize it
because prior to my current circumstances,

01:44.646 --> 01:48.233
for 16 years,
I was a Federation High Court Justice.

01:48.316 --> 01:50.527
-I have a question.
-Woman, I swear to God.

01:50.610 --> 01:54.322
How'd you go from being a Federation judge
to, like, blowing space truckers?

01:54.405 --> 01:56.032
Well, missy.

01:56.116 --> 01:58.076
[chuckling] That is a...

01:58.159 --> 02:00.453
Oh, that is a long, crazy story.

02:00.537 --> 02:03.081
[clears throat]
But it is entirely non-germane

02:03.164 --> 02:05.375
to the solemn proceeding
before this bench.

02:06.000 --> 02:08.002
And so, Mr. Archer,

02:08.086 --> 02:10.797
having reminded you
that the man who represents himself

02:10.880 --> 02:12.132
has a fool for a client--

02:12.215 --> 02:14.801
[laughs] I'm not representing myself.

02:14.884 --> 02:16.094
Well, then who is?

02:16.177 --> 02:19.264
[laughs] Oh, just TV's Michael Gray.

02:19.931 --> 02:24.144
Who, for reasons known but to God,
is wearing seersucker.

02:24.227 --> 02:26.646
So if you wanna go ahead
and do that motion to dismiss,

02:26.729 --> 02:28.773
now would, uh, maybe be a good time.

02:29.816 --> 02:31.818
Oh, and also, we wish to countersue.

02:31.901 --> 02:33.153
-I'm not typing that.
-What?

02:33.236 --> 02:34.279
[Ray] I'm gonna allow it.

02:34.362 --> 02:37.782
For injuries and damages from you assholes
attempting to murder me

02:37.866 --> 02:40.368
so Lana could steal half of the ship.

02:40.451 --> 02:42.829
Well, when TV's Michael Gray
is done with you,

02:42.912 --> 02:45.123
I'm gonna own your half.

02:45.206 --> 02:47.667
So, hey,
I don't think this is going as well

02:47.750 --> 02:49.085
as you think it's going.

02:51.629 --> 02:53.423
You goddamn crook.

02:55.300 --> 02:57.302
[theme music playing]

03:32.128 --> 03:34.130
[Archer and Lana grunting]

03:38.134 --> 03:40.929
Jesus, okay. I think that's enough.

03:41.012 --> 03:43.264
I don't wish to cause the witness
any further distress.

03:43.348 --> 03:44.349
I'm fine, Your Honor.

03:44.432 --> 03:46.267
-What about my magazine?
-Will you--

03:46.351 --> 03:48.603
There's lots more video, Your Honor.

03:48.686 --> 03:51.606
Like the part when Pam smashed me
in the head with a fire extinguisher.

03:51.689 --> 03:55.193
[laughing] Yeah! Play that. Ka-klunk.

03:55.985 --> 03:58.863
Do the people have any further questions
for this witness?

03:58.947 --> 04:00.114
Not at this time, Your Honor.

04:00.198 --> 04:01.616
Then your witness.

04:02.492 --> 04:04.202
Well? Uh, what are you waiting for?

04:05.954 --> 04:09.040
Get up there and cross-examine her.
What are you, hourly?

04:09.123 --> 04:11.626
I think I would be, if I was a lawyer.

04:11.709 --> 04:14.087
-Damn it.
-Look at me. Look at me. Look at me.

04:14.170 --> 04:15.630
Something is wrong with your brain.

04:15.713 --> 04:18.424
You need to plead not guilty
by reason of insanity.

04:18.508 --> 04:22.303
Beg them for mercy
and realize you're hallucinating me.

04:24.055 --> 04:25.807
I'll see you disbarred for this.

04:25.890 --> 04:27.392
Great, look forward to it.

04:27.475 --> 04:30.812
Point of procedure.
I, uh, no longer wish to be represented

04:30.895 --> 04:32.438
by TV's Michael Gray.

04:32.522 --> 04:36.693
All righty. Are the people okay with him
not having an imaginary lawyer?

04:36.776 --> 04:38.278
[chuckling] They're great with it.

04:38.361 --> 04:39.612
Then your witness.

04:39.696 --> 04:43.366
Thank you. Now, then, Miss Kane, is it?

04:43.825 --> 04:46.286
-[static crackling]
-Yup.

04:46.369 --> 04:47.620
[sighs] Um...

04:48.288 --> 04:49.706
Damn, I had something for this.

04:49.789 --> 04:51.124
-Did ya?
-[Archer] Actually,

04:51.207 --> 04:57.630
can we maybe call her back at a, uh,
time later than, um, later than now?

04:57.714 --> 05:00.216
You're just a regular Clarence Darrow.

05:00.300 --> 05:04.304
[sighs] You may step down. Thank you.
Call your next witness.

05:04.387 --> 05:08.891
Your Honor, the people call
the defendant's mother, Malory Archer.

05:08.975 --> 05:11.185
Boo.

05:12.562 --> 05:15.648
-Come on, are we not doing that?
-[door hisses]

05:17.608 --> 05:19.235
Ooh.

05:19.319 --> 05:21.321
Oh, come on. Are you kidding me?

05:21.404 --> 05:22.864
Sit down, sir!

05:22.947 --> 05:25.825
Are you-- She's dressed
exactly like Marlene Dietrich

05:25.908 --> 05:27.493
in <i>Witness for the Prosecution</i>,

05:27.577 --> 05:30.663
right down to the hair
and the rakish little beret.

05:30.747 --> 05:32.040
[chuckles] Are you seeing this?

05:32.415 --> 05:33.875
-Are you?
-What...

05:34.542 --> 05:35.585
-[static crackling]
-How the--

05:35.668 --> 05:37.462
Objection. I object.

05:37.545 --> 05:40.214
-To what?
-I will ask the question!

05:40.298 --> 05:41.924
[clears throat]
It's actually the same question.

05:42.008 --> 05:43.760
I don't know. Everything!

05:43.843 --> 05:45.511
Oh, then I guess we can all go home.

05:45.595 --> 05:46.763
-[static crackling]
-Can we?

05:46.846 --> 05:47.847
What the hell is happening?

05:47.930 --> 05:49.015
Don't look at me.

05:49.098 --> 05:51.100
Goddamn it, TV's Michael Gray.

05:51.184 --> 05:53.102
-Uh, Your Honor--
-Wait, wait, shut up.

05:53.186 --> 05:54.187
You shut up!

05:54.771 --> 05:56.522
Order! You're out of order!

05:56.606 --> 06:01.486
You're out of order! You're out of order!
This whole trial is out of order!

06:01.569 --> 06:03.279
-[muffled alarm]
-They're out of order!

06:03.362 --> 06:04.947
Everybody shut up!

06:05.031 --> 06:08.451
And you bang that thing one more time,
I'll break it off inside you.

06:08.534 --> 06:09.535
[coughing] Legit phrasing.

06:09.619 --> 06:12.038
-Shh! Listen.
-[female voice] <i>Proximity alert.</i>

06:12.121 --> 06:13.122
-What's going on?
-What alert?

06:13.206 --> 06:14.707
Why the hell is there a proximity--

06:14.791 --> 06:16.292
-[rumbling]
-[all] Whoa!

06:16.375 --> 06:17.877
-Ow!
-[female voice] <i>Collision.</i>

06:17.960 --> 06:19.796
How the-- Who's on the bridge?

06:19.879 --> 06:24.342
Nobody, because we're all down here
at this goddamn kangaroo railroad.

06:24.425 --> 06:29.097
-What?
-The--the--the--the--the-- Choo-choo!

06:29.180 --> 06:31.516
Krieger! Why aren't you up there?

06:31.599 --> 06:32.600
Well, then who would do this?

06:33.434 --> 06:36.020
Holy shit, dude, that's really good.

06:36.104 --> 06:37.230
You don't think it's derivative?

06:37.313 --> 06:39.273
No, 'cause I don't know what that is.

06:39.357 --> 06:41.442
-[sighs] It's when--
-Krieger! Status report!

06:41.526 --> 06:43.611
[groans]

06:43.694 --> 06:45.071
Right?

06:45.154 --> 06:49.408
Okay, uh, we've got moderate hull damage
to starboard amidships, um--

06:49.492 --> 06:51.619
-From what?
-I don't know. Jesus.

06:51.702 --> 06:53.788
Turn that thing to the exterior cameras.

06:53.871 --> 06:54.872
Oh, right.

-[monitor chimes]
-[all gasp]

06:57.875 --> 07:00.044
-[Malory] Oh, my God.
-[Archer] A Dri'n attack barge.

07:00.128 --> 07:01.754
Which means...

07:02.588 --> 07:04.006
boarding party.

07:04.090 --> 07:06.217
<i>And there ain't no party</i>
<i>like a boarding party</i>

07:06.300 --> 07:09.387
<i>'cause a boarding party don't stop.</i>
[laughs]

07:10.012 --> 07:14.517
<i>Well, until these monstrous bastards</i>
<i>have slaked their thirst for blood.</i>

07:15.017 --> 07:17.979

07:23.317 --> 07:25.236
What do we do? What do we do?

07:25.319 --> 07:28.948
Well, the first thing we've gotta do,
and I'm sure we can all agree on this,

07:29.907 --> 07:31.159
is declare a mistrial.

07:38.749 --> 07:40.793
Come on, man. What's taking so long?

07:40.877 --> 07:42.503
[speaking Dri'n]

07:42.587 --> 07:44.088
-"Space metal"?
-[grunts]

07:44.172 --> 07:46.257
Think about how dumb that sounds.

07:46.340 --> 07:48.885
Now, come on,
let's peel this banana and...

07:48.968 --> 07:50.261
[grunts] ...take a bite.

07:50.344 --> 07:52.972
I mean, before they all get away
in an escape pod, of course.

07:53.055 --> 07:54.682
-[Lana] Cyril!
-[Cyril] Lana...

07:54.765 --> 07:57.018
-You are not... abandoning ship.
-I'm serious.

07:57.101 --> 07:58.769
Do not make me hit you.

07:58.853 --> 07:59.854
Excuse me?

07:59.937 --> 08:01.689
No, I-- I didn't mean that.

08:01.772 --> 08:02.857
[groans]

08:02.940 --> 08:03.941
-Whoa!
-Ow!

08:04.025 --> 08:05.276
[laughs] Serves you right.

08:05.359 --> 08:07.236
Trying to cut the line like that.

08:07.320 --> 08:10.865
What... No one is abandoning ship.
We're gonna stay here and fight.

08:10.948 --> 08:12.617
-[overlapping chatter]
-I really don't think we should.

08:12.700 --> 08:14.577
[laughs] Yeah, good luck with that.

08:14.660 --> 08:17.663
-Meaning?
-Meaning those freaks are literally gonna

08:17.747 --> 08:18.956
chew you up and spit you out.

08:19.040 --> 08:20.917
-Well--
-Or not spit you out.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.752
I don't know about
pirate dining etiquette,

08:22.835 --> 08:24.629
but definitely the chewing up part.

08:24.712 --> 08:26.339
-[static crackling]
-Well, nobody asked you,

08:26.422 --> 08:28.883
since last I checked,
you're a goddamn mutineer.

08:28.966 --> 08:31.469
Well, the last I checked,
and I'm not being facetious,

08:31.552 --> 08:33.137
-nice sweater dress.
-What?

08:33.221 --> 08:34.472
-Sweater dress?
-What?

08:34.555 --> 08:36.432
So you think maybe you are crazy?

08:36.516 --> 08:39.727
[laughs] I'm crazy?

08:39.810 --> 08:41.312
-I mean...
-She's crazy

08:41.395 --> 08:43.564
if she thinks
she can fight off an entire barge

08:43.648 --> 08:45.900
full of murderous Dri'n pirates
without me.

08:45.983 --> 08:47.276
Uh, first of all--

08:47.360 --> 08:48.945
-[alarm blaring]
-[female voice] Hull breach.

08:49.028 --> 08:50.738
-Oh, no.
-Oh, that's no good.

08:50.821 --> 08:52.281
Talk about crazy, huh?

08:53.866 --> 08:57.370
Whoo! Now, that's what I call a nice gash.

08:57.453 --> 08:59.455
[laughing, snarling]

09:00.581 --> 09:02.583
No, we're not doing space phrasing.

09:02.667 --> 09:05.253
-[snarls]
-Uh, because it's derivative.

09:05.336 --> 09:08.172
-And also because I said so.
-[female voice] <i>Hull breach.</i>

09:08.256 --> 09:09.549
I'm the only chance you've got.

09:09.632 --> 09:10.841
[Malory] He's right, you know.

09:10.925 --> 09:12.468
Yeah, you gotta let him go.

09:12.552 --> 09:14.387
That, or let us in that damn pod!

09:14.470 --> 09:15.888
-I vote pod.
-Cyril!

09:15.972 --> 09:20.101
And, I'm sorry, have we all forgotten
he basically sexually assaulted me

09:20.184 --> 09:21.602
with a rolled-up magazine?

09:21.686 --> 09:22.853
-No.
-That's evidence.

09:22.937 --> 09:23.938
You're evidence!

09:24.021 --> 09:25.898
And there was nothing sexual about it.

09:25.982 --> 09:29.402
I don't know.
I thought it was pretty sexy.

09:29.485 --> 09:31.237
[alarm continues blaring]

09:31.320 --> 09:33.990
On Opposite Day. Gross, you guys!

09:34.073 --> 09:35.074
Goddamn.

09:35.157 --> 09:39.620
Lana, I'm sorry I attacked you.
I honestly don't know what got into me.

09:39.704 --> 09:43.082
And when this is over,
you can punish me however you see fit.

09:43.165 --> 09:44.542
It's "howmever."

09:44.625 --> 09:48.129
Shut up! But this calls for some
serious swashbuckling,

09:48.212 --> 09:51.549
and no one else
can buckle swashes like me, so--

19:21.118 --> 19:22.786
Gladys! He's awake!

19:22.870 --> 19:27.624
-He's awake.
-Yeah, um, duh. Why am I in a hospital?

19:27.708 --> 19:30.127
You were shot by a crazy woman.

19:30.210 --> 19:32.254
[gasps] Just like Eddie Waitkus.

19:32.337 --> 19:33.797
-Who?
-Don't get him started.

19:33.881 --> 19:35.591
[chuckles] Oh, man. For a second there,

19:35.674 --> 19:37.718
I thought maybe the booze
had caught up with me.

19:37.801 --> 19:39.219
Ooh, speaking of...

19:40.470 --> 19:43.098
-With me standing right here?
-He's gonna need it.

19:43.182 --> 19:47.603
Wait, why? Wait, wait, wait, wait.
How long have I been here?

19:48.937 --> 19:50.564
-Mother?
-Sterling--

19:50.647 --> 19:51.899
Mother, how long have I been here?

19:51.982 --> 19:54.484
[sighs] Three years.

19:54.568 --> 19:56.653
What? No. Three--

19:57.529 --> 19:59.656
Wait, not-- No. No, no, no.

19:59.740 --> 20:01.158
You want me to call Dr. Gorenstein?

20:01.241 --> 20:03.452
Oh, please.
You think he could be bothered?

20:03.535 --> 20:05.287
At midnight on a Sunday?

20:06.747 --> 20:08.457
Plus, what would his mistress say?

20:08.540 --> 20:12.002
[laughs] So bad.

20:12.085 --> 20:14.546
Wait, why are you here
at midnight on a Sunday?

20:14.630 --> 20:17.090
Well, I, um--

20:17.174 --> 20:18.425
She's always here.

20:18.508 --> 20:20.636
Oh, now, not always.

20:21.678 --> 20:23.680
[monitor beeping steadily]

20:31.772 --> 20:33.899
Let me get you some ice chips.

20:35.859 --> 20:37.069
For three years?

20:37.152 --> 20:39.738
I wanted to be here when you woke up.

20:41.531 --> 20:45.994
[exhales sharply] Okay, so, like,
what about Lana?

20:46.078 --> 20:48.538
-Lana?
-Hey, wait, do I have a kid?

20:48.622 --> 20:51.833
There's plenty of time
to talk about all of that.

20:52.542 --> 20:56.838
The important thing is that you're back
and we're together.

20:56.922 --> 20:58.757
Um, uh, okay.

20:58.840 --> 21:03.512
After all, the real story's
always been about you and me.

21:03.595 --> 21:04.638
What are you--

21:04.721 --> 21:08.308
Which, when you think about it,
at its heart...

21:09.518 --> 21:11.144
it's really a love story.

21:11.645 --> 21:13.855
Please, Mother, don't say that.

21:14.564 --> 21:15.607
It's true.

21:18.110 --> 21:19.152
Yuck.
