00:52.918 --> 00:55.854
uh-huh, yeah.
All right. Bye.

00:55.921 --> 01:00.825
Gloria, we'd better set
the table for dinner.
It's almost 6:00.

01:00.893 --> 01:06.064
It really makes a person wonder.
It really makes you wonder.
What?

01:06.132 --> 01:08.900
Well, that was
Mrs. bellini on the phone.

01:08.968 --> 01:14.539
You remember her 22-year-old
son Paul, the one that
lives in California?

01:14.606 --> 01:20.344
Well, a person can't
even call his own home
his own home no more.

01:20.412 --> 01:26.084
- Ma, what happened?
- He was just evicted
from his volkswagen bus.

01:28.154 --> 01:32.123
You check the stew
and I'll get the salad.
Okay.

01:32.191 --> 01:35.860
What are you reading?
Oh, I'm just reading
some old love letters...

01:35.928 --> 01:39.630
That Michael sent me
before we were married.
That's nice.

01:39.699 --> 01:44.069
Oh, I see you keep your love
letters in an old cigar box.

01:44.136 --> 01:46.938
Dutch masters.

01:47.006 --> 01:50.241
I keep my buttons
in white owl.

01:52.511 --> 01:54.879
You get the silverware, Gloria.
Okay.

01:54.947 --> 01:58.583
Hey, ma. Do you ever read
any of the love letters
daddy sent you?

01:58.650 --> 02:01.485
- No.
- Why not?

02:01.553 --> 02:04.923
He never sent me none.

02:06.092 --> 02:08.559
Wait a minute,
I take that back.

02:08.627 --> 02:13.497
Once when he was visiting
his cousin in Newark,
he sent me a postcard.

02:13.565 --> 02:15.934
What did the card say, ma?

02:16.001 --> 02:19.804
It said, "dear Edith,
how is the weather there?

02:19.872 --> 02:25.009
It's raining here in Newark.
Yours truly, Archie bunker."

02:25.077 --> 02:30.448
- I think that's awful.
- So do I. That's why
I like living here.

02:30.515 --> 02:32.516
It don't rain so much.

02:34.720 --> 02:39.858
No, ma.
I mean I think it's awful
you never got a love letter.

02:39.925 --> 02:44.129
Oh, I didn't say
I never got a love letter.

02:44.196 --> 02:46.998
When I first started
going with your father,

02:47.066 --> 02:51.936
I was still going with a boy
named Freddy withausen.

02:52.004 --> 02:54.338
I got one from him.

02:54.406 --> 02:57.876
Did you like it, ma?
Oh, yeah.

02:57.943 --> 03:03.214
He was quite a catch.
He had a real important job.

03:03.282 --> 03:08.186
He worked
for the highway department
as a hot tar watcher.

03:10.122 --> 03:14.692
A what watcher?
His job was
to watch them...

03:14.760 --> 03:17.395
Pour the hot tar
on the street...

03:17.462 --> 03:22.100
And make sure it was even before
the steam roller went over it.

03:22.168 --> 03:25.770
He sure doesn't
sound like someone who'd
send a girl a love letter.

03:25.838 --> 03:28.639
Oh, I don't know about that.

03:28.707 --> 03:34.478
A man who watches hot tar
all day must dream a lot.

03:37.116 --> 03:39.684
You know what, Gloria?

03:39.751 --> 03:44.923
In his letter he called me
his goddess of beauty.
[ Chuckles ]

03:44.990 --> 03:47.458
How come you married
daddy instead of him?

03:47.526 --> 03:50.962
Well, I liked being called
a goddess of beauty.

03:51.030 --> 03:53.731
But somehow
it seemed more permanent...

03:53.799 --> 03:57.435
When your father
called me a dingbat.

04:00.806 --> 04:05.109
Hey, ma. I bet you
still got Freddy's
love letter though, huh?

04:05.177 --> 04:10.081
Oh, no. I burned it.
Oh, your father was
so jealous of him.

04:10.149 --> 04:12.083
If he ever found that letter--

04:12.151 --> 04:15.119
Edith, I'm home.

04:15.187 --> 04:18.289
At least I think I'm home.
Maybe this ain't my home.

04:18.357 --> 04:21.759
What do you mean, Archie?
No, no. Hold it.
I mean it's 6:00 P.M.

04:21.827 --> 04:24.795
I just come through
the dining room there.
The table ain't set for supper.

04:24.864 --> 04:28.466
Oh, I'm sorry.
Me and Gloria got to talking.

04:28.533 --> 04:30.468
What do I look like,
one of them Broadway dudes...

04:30.535 --> 04:34.705
Or high-society guys that
eat late, maybe 6:15, 6:20?

04:36.375 --> 04:40.144
I'm sorry, daddy.
It's my fault.
I'll set the table.

04:40.212 --> 04:42.747
Here, let me take
your coat and hat.

04:42.814 --> 04:46.317
I'll help Gloria set the table
if you'll stir the stew.

04:46.385 --> 04:49.387
Aw, come on. What is this?
I come home from work--

04:53.225 --> 04:55.493
what the hell is this here?

04:55.560 --> 04:58.062
"My dearest darling--"

05:01.100 --> 05:03.368
aw, geez, this is awful.

05:03.435 --> 05:06.871
Hey, arch.
I brought some apple pie
home for dessert.

05:06.939 --> 05:09.707
I'll just stick it
in the oven here and heat it up.
Hold it. Hold it.

05:09.775 --> 05:11.842
You don't need
the oven for that there.

05:11.911 --> 05:13.844
Why, what are you
talking about?

05:13.913 --> 05:18.216
I'm talking about this.
I quote from the writings
of Michael stivic meathead.

05:18.284 --> 05:21.652
"My dearest darling Gloria,
whenever I kiss your soft
sweet lips,

05:21.720 --> 05:24.455
my mouth is inflamed by
the consuming fires of love."

05:24.523 --> 05:28.059
You don't need the oven
for that. You can heat it
with your flaming mouth.

05:30.729 --> 05:33.731
Where did you get that?
It don't make no difference
where I get this.

05:33.799 --> 05:37.135
This proves to me that you took
advantage of my little girl.
Here. Read that.

05:39.138 --> 05:41.072
Is that all?

05:41.140 --> 05:43.607
Gloria and I spent
a weekend in Massachusetts.
What's the big deal?

05:43.675 --> 05:45.609
The big deal is the date
on this here letter.

05:45.677 --> 05:47.778
That's long before
youse two was married.

05:47.846 --> 05:51.049
What's the difference?
We're married now, aren't we?
That's no excuse, meathead.

05:51.116 --> 05:53.717
Give me that.
No way.
Hey, give me that back.

05:53.785 --> 05:57.788
Hey. Whatever you're doing,
stop here. I want you
to take a look at this here.

05:57.856 --> 06:00.624
You know what this means?
It means that your daughter here
before she was married--

06:00.692 --> 06:02.927
well, I ain't gonna soil
your ears by even saying it.

06:02.995 --> 06:07.265
Just read it yourself. Go ahead.
Daddy, you were reading
my letters. How could you?

06:07.333 --> 06:10.468
It wasn't easy with all
the pornography in there.

06:10.535 --> 06:14.738
Arch, that weekend
we just went to an outdoor
concert up there. That's all.

06:14.806 --> 06:17.608
Besides,
it happened over two years ago.
What are you so shocked about?

06:17.676 --> 06:21.279
Hold it.
I ain't the only one that's
shocked here and bereaved.

06:21.347 --> 06:23.414
Look at the shock--
look in your
mother-in-law's face.

06:26.385 --> 06:28.853
<i>Oh.</i>

06:30.655 --> 06:35.293
Oh, this is so sweet.
"And now my dearest darling--"
<i>don't read it.</i>

06:35.361 --> 06:37.761
I know what's in it.

06:37.829 --> 06:40.999
Don't that bother you that
your daughter was involved
in a thing like that?

06:41.066 --> 06:43.868
I always trusted Gloria.

06:43.935 --> 06:47.238
So did I.
But I never trusted
the flaming polock here.

06:47.306 --> 06:50.975
Hey! Hey!
Never call me that.
That's what you are!

06:51.043 --> 06:53.478
Daddy, someday you're gonna
go too far with Michael.

06:53.545 --> 06:56.847
Me going too far with him
ain't the problem here.

06:59.418 --> 07:03.854
And look at you standing there,
the mother of her.

07:03.922 --> 07:07.125
You look about
as worried as a dead bird.

07:07.192 --> 07:10.228
Daddy, why should she worry now?
She wasn't worried about it
when it happened.

07:10.295 --> 07:12.497
Because when it happened it--

07:12.564 --> 07:14.698
oh.

07:17.669 --> 07:20.971
She wasn't worried
when it happened, huh?

07:21.040 --> 07:24.742
- Because she knew that it
happened at the time, right?
- Daddy, don't blame ma.

07:24.809 --> 07:27.245
She didn't tell you about it
'cause she didn't
want you to worry.

07:27.312 --> 07:32.716
Oh, she didn't want me to worry.
The two of youse was all
upset about me, huh?

07:32.784 --> 07:34.852
Ain't that nice?

07:34.920 --> 07:37.621
What the hell
kind of banana oil is that?

07:37.689 --> 07:40.491
You don't tell me
nothing around here.
Everything is a secret.

07:40.559 --> 07:44.429
Archie, I didn't
tell you about it because
you would've just get upset.

07:44.496 --> 07:46.230
Yeah, and spoil
our whole weekend.

07:46.298 --> 07:48.966
That kind of a weekend
ought to be spoiled.

07:49.034 --> 07:52.703
Archie, it seemed
all right at the time
for her to go on the weekend.

07:52.771 --> 07:54.705
All the kids was doing it.

07:54.773 --> 07:58.909
That's my point, Edith.
All the kids was doing it.

07:58.977 --> 08:01.845
And you still
stood still for that there?

08:01.913 --> 08:04.848
Do you mean to tell me
the fact that two people
go away on a weekend...

08:04.916 --> 08:06.917
Don't spell something fishy?

08:06.985 --> 08:10.288
Oh, no.
That ain't always true, Archie.

08:10.355 --> 08:14.258
That weekend I spent
with Freddy withausen
there was nothing fishy.

08:14.326 --> 08:16.260
Hold it, hold it, hold it.

08:23.668 --> 08:25.603
Weekend that you--

08:25.670 --> 08:28.306
wait a minute.
Get out of here.

08:31.676 --> 08:33.844
You spent the weekend
with Freddy withausen?

08:33.912 --> 08:37.414
The hot tar watcher?

08:37.482 --> 08:39.817
How did you know?
You wasn't even born then.

08:39.884 --> 08:41.919
Nothing happened, Archie.

08:41.986 --> 08:46.491
We just went up to a little
cabin his parents had
in the woods.

08:51.430 --> 08:53.364
In the woods?

08:54.366 --> 08:57.301
What did you do up there?
Nothing.

08:57.369 --> 08:59.370
Oh, nothing.

08:59.438 --> 09:02.140
Would you have went
up to a little cabin
in the woods with me?

09:02.207 --> 09:05.176
I guess so.
What for?

09:07.846 --> 09:10.681
'Cause you asked me.
Oh, 'cause I asked you.

09:10.749 --> 09:13.284
And then Freddy asked you.
How many other people asked you?

09:13.352 --> 09:16.020
How many little cabins
in the woods you got
in your past life?

09:17.489 --> 09:20.391
Just that one.
Oh, just that one, huh?

09:20.459 --> 09:23.127
There must have been something
special about that cabin
and Freddy withausen.

09:23.195 --> 09:25.429
Oh, look at that.
He's jealous.

09:25.497 --> 09:29.634
I don't believe it.
Something happened 25 years ago
and you're jealous.

09:29.701 --> 09:32.936
Clam up, you.
Get out of here.
You're jealous.

09:33.004 --> 09:37.441
Whoa, boy. He's jealous.
I don't believe it.
Get into the kitchen there.

09:37.509 --> 09:41.379
- You're jealous.
- Go eat an apple pie,
hot lips.

09:47.152 --> 09:49.253
Are you jealous, Archie?

09:49.321 --> 09:51.289
Cut that out.

09:52.891 --> 09:55.693
You mean to tell me
that when I was overseas
in the service,

09:55.760 --> 09:57.695
you was running around
with another guy?

09:57.762 --> 10:01.765
Oh, no.
You was back home by then.

10:01.833 --> 10:04.402
I was not.

10:04.469 --> 10:08.439
I was over there waiting for
my discharge in staten island.

10:13.579 --> 10:16.314
So that's what
was going on, huh?

10:16.381 --> 10:18.583
Whoa.

10:18.650 --> 10:22.620
What kills me is you never
told me nothing about it.

10:22.688 --> 10:26.257
But, Archie, I never thought
you wanted to hear about it.

10:26.325 --> 10:28.826
What was you doing that
I wouldn't wanna hear about?

10:28.893 --> 10:32.363
Nothing.
If you wanna hear
about it, I'll tell you.

10:32.431 --> 10:34.565
Don't tell me nothing.

10:38.370 --> 10:40.938
Tell me everything.

10:41.005 --> 10:44.041
Well, it was out
at lake quonkonkema.

10:44.109 --> 10:48.446
Freddy's parents was there too,
sort of chaperones.
Yeah, yeah?

10:48.513 --> 10:52.583
Oh, it was beautiful there,
Archie, the trees and all.

10:52.651 --> 10:57.622
Once Freddy and I
went down to the lake
at 5:00 in the morning...

10:57.689 --> 10:59.724
Just to watch the sun come up.

10:59.791 --> 11:03.394
What were youse doing
before the sun come up?

11:03.462 --> 11:05.996
Sleeping.
Sleeping?

11:06.064 --> 11:07.998
Yeah.

11:08.066 --> 11:10.200
What does that mean?

11:10.269 --> 11:13.003
Well, it means that--
I don't wanna know.

11:14.273 --> 11:17.107
Oh,

11:17.175 --> 11:19.143
well.

11:19.210 --> 11:23.947
If I ever see that
Freddy withausen again,
I'll feather him in his own tar.

11:24.015 --> 11:26.717
I'm afraid you can't
do that, Archie.

11:26.785 --> 11:28.552
What do you mean I can't?
Why not?

11:28.620 --> 11:30.655
He died six years ago.

11:32.491 --> 11:34.525
Lucky for him.

11:37.262 --> 11:41.299
I remember when I read about
his funeral in the paper,

11:41.366 --> 11:43.901
I sent him a nice
bouquet of flowers.

11:45.069 --> 11:47.004
You sent him flowers?

11:47.071 --> 11:49.640
I guess I forgot
to tell you about that.

11:49.708 --> 11:53.844
Yeah, I guess you forgot
to tell me about that, Edith.

11:53.912 --> 11:55.846
Sure, you did.

11:55.914 --> 11:59.383
It's like the millions
of other little things
you always forget to tell me.

11:59.451 --> 12:02.520
Well, that's the straw
that broke the camel's neck.

12:02.587 --> 12:05.790
Archie, where are you going?

12:05.857 --> 12:08.426
I'm going to kelcy's bar.
That's where I'm going.

12:08.493 --> 12:10.894
Where else would I go, Edith?

12:10.962 --> 12:13.364
And when I come back,
as long as I ain't a part...

12:13.432 --> 12:16.266
Of your little secret
service around here,

12:16.335 --> 12:20.103
I'll just, uh, eat
at the table over there,

12:20.171 --> 12:22.540
sleep up in our bed.

12:22.607 --> 12:25.643
Maybe watch the television
over here once in a while.
And outside of that,

12:25.711 --> 12:29.580
you can just treat me
as if I was another
stranger under your roof.

12:29.648 --> 12:32.015
Oh, ar--
no, no, no.
Stay there. Stay there.

12:34.000 --> 12:40.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

12:41.960 --> 12:44.829
And you can think
about this, Edith.

12:44.896 --> 12:48.366
In all the 25 years
you and me have been together,

12:49.534 --> 12:52.069
you ain't never once
sent me no flowers.

13:02.313 --> 13:04.281
Thanks, Tommy.

13:04.349 --> 13:07.184
Wanna watch some tv, arch?
Oh, no.
Tommy, you know.

13:07.252 --> 13:10.421
I don't wanna watch the tv.
I need someone to talk to me.

13:10.489 --> 13:13.758
Geez, I've been listening
to people all day, arch.
I need a break.

13:17.028 --> 13:21.699
Thanks a lot there, Tommy.
If I didn't wanna talk to
nobody, I could've stood home.

13:21.767 --> 13:24.101
Oh, hi, arch.
Aw, geez.

13:24.168 --> 13:27.271
I said I wanted to talk,
but I ain't this desperate.

13:29.508 --> 13:31.575
Hey, uh, Tommy.
Let me have a beer
there, will you?

13:31.643 --> 13:33.577
Sure.
[ Gunfire, explosions on tv ]

13:33.645 --> 13:35.579
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute. Tommy.

13:35.647 --> 13:37.981
Will you turn
that tv off up there?

13:38.049 --> 13:40.418
It's a good movie.
The japs are invading
wake island.

13:40.485 --> 13:45.122
I know how it come out, Tommy.
They lost. Will you turn it off?

13:47.025 --> 13:50.528
[ Tv shuts off ]
I'll say one thing
for them japs though.

13:50.595 --> 13:52.763
They certainly know
how to treat their women.

13:52.831 --> 13:57.601
Did you know in Japan a woman's
gotta walk 10 feet behind
her husband all the time?

13:57.669 --> 14:01.739
And they gotta wear carpet
slippers so the guys ain't
disturbed by the high heels.

14:07.178 --> 14:09.112
We ought to have
something like that over here.

14:10.248 --> 14:13.116
Uh, arch, you mind
if I tell you something?

14:13.184 --> 14:16.754
Yeah. But that ain't
gonna stop you. I know.

14:16.822 --> 14:19.323
Y-you sitting here
and sulking, that's not
gonna do you any good.

14:19.390 --> 14:21.826
Why don't you come home
and talk things over with ma?

14:21.893 --> 14:25.796
Because you can't talk to her.
You can't talk to women.

14:25.864 --> 14:28.799
First place,
they don't tell you nothing
they don't want you to know.

14:28.867 --> 14:32.002
They all do that.
They're all the same,
all of them.

14:33.104 --> 14:36.607
Except of course
my blessed mother...

14:36.675 --> 14:38.843
Who never spent
no weekend with no guy.

14:38.910 --> 14:43.113
- Well, what if she did?
- I'm talking about my mother.
Ain't nothing sacred to you?

14:43.181 --> 14:47.885
Arch, all Edith did was
spend an innocent weekend
in the country, that's all.

14:47.953 --> 14:53.457
An innocent weekend? There
ain't no such thing, buddy.
Not the way I was brought up.

14:53.525 --> 14:55.759
Let me tell you something.
In my day,

14:55.827 --> 14:58.762
if a girl was seen
packing her suitcase
on a Friday afternoon,

14:58.830 --> 15:01.131
she was a marked woman.

15:03.167 --> 15:07.738
And I mean in
big red letters there,
"spoiled goods."

15:07.806 --> 15:11.575
Don't you think it's silly
in our day and age to be
preaching old-fashioned virtue?

15:11.643 --> 15:15.212
No. If we had a little
more of the old-fashioned
virtue around here,

15:15.279 --> 15:20.584
we wouldn't have so many
new-fashioned babies running
around looking for their papas.

15:20.652 --> 15:22.620
Arch, I didn't come here
to argue with you.

15:22.687 --> 15:24.655
Why don't you just finish
your beer and come home?

15:24.723 --> 15:28.659
And why don't you take
a long walk on a short pier?

15:28.727 --> 15:32.930
Arch, this whole thing is crazy.
Twenty-five years ago, ma went
away on an innocent weekend.

15:32.998 --> 15:34.965
And even if it wasn't
innocent, so what?

15:35.033 --> 15:37.034
Shush.

15:38.703 --> 15:41.338
Get over there.

15:44.709 --> 15:48.846
What the hell's the matter with
you opening your big foghorn
mouth in front of Tommy there?

15:48.914 --> 15:53.216
Listen, arch--
no, you listen to me.

15:53.284 --> 15:57.755
A guy before he marries
has got a right to expect
the girl he marries to be pure.

15:57.822 --> 16:00.824
But what about you arch?
Before you were married,
were you pure?

16:00.892 --> 16:02.826
Hey, hey, hey.
None of your business.
Huh?

16:02.894 --> 16:05.930
You couldn't have been, right?
You were in the army.
You were overseas.

16:05.997 --> 16:07.965
That's different.

16:08.033 --> 16:10.768
A guy's overseas
fighting for his country,
he's got some excuse.

16:14.039 --> 16:16.674
What did you do,
get a note from your corporal?

16:23.214 --> 16:26.483
Don't try to be funny,
will you, meathead?

16:26.551 --> 16:30.988
We was fighting men over there.
We was all tensed up
from being in action.

16:31.056 --> 16:34.658
There's a break in the action.
Some of the boys wanted
to go someplace.

16:34.726 --> 16:37.294
I went along too.
I didn't know
where we was going.

16:37.361 --> 16:39.429
First thing I know,
I was there.

16:41.399 --> 16:45.302
You want me
to leave them thinking
I was some kind of a queer?

16:45.369 --> 16:49.673
- All right.
So you weren't pure.
- That's another thing.

16:49.741 --> 16:53.777
A man ain't supposed to--
I mean that's part
of being a man.

16:53.845 --> 16:56.179
Oh, boy.
The old double standard, huh?

16:56.247 --> 16:58.983
No, smart guy.
That's the Bible
if you wanna know.

16:59.050 --> 17:01.819
The Bible says
a woman's gotta be pure.

17:01.886 --> 17:04.021
It says so
on practically every page.

17:04.089 --> 17:06.790
Well, shouldn't
the same thing go for men?

17:06.858 --> 17:09.358
It don't say that about the men.

17:11.128 --> 17:13.964
I mean the men
in the Bible, all them
old-time religious guys,

17:14.031 --> 17:16.500
they always had
lots of women around.

17:16.567 --> 17:20.838
Take your Abraham, David,
sodom and gomorrah.
All them guys.

17:25.010 --> 17:28.411
Look, arch. All I know
is one thing. The way you're
thinking about ma is crazy.

17:28.479 --> 17:31.214
I mean, after all,
you're the guy
she married, right?

17:31.282 --> 17:34.518
That, uh, what's his name,
Freddy withausen?
He's dead and buried.

17:35.520 --> 17:38.455
He was alive
up in that cabin.

17:38.523 --> 17:40.624
That was 25 years ago.

17:40.692 --> 17:43.727
What difference does
that make how long ago it was?

17:44.829 --> 17:47.197
I mean,
it makes a guy wonder.

17:47.265 --> 17:49.667
After all, maybe I was
only second choice.

17:49.734 --> 17:53.137
Maybe I ain't the real husband.
Maybe the real guy
didn't show up there...

17:53.204 --> 17:56.506
And I won by--
what do you call-- default.

17:56.574 --> 18:00.144
What are you talking about?
You know the way ma treats you,
waiting on you hand and foot.

18:00.211 --> 18:02.146
You know
how she feels about you.

18:02.213 --> 18:05.649
But she never
tells me nothing.

18:05.717 --> 18:09.186
And when I come home from work
and I say, "what's new, Edith?"

18:09.253 --> 18:14.024
I want her to tell me what's new
even if it is 25 years old.

18:19.998 --> 18:23.300
She's damn well gonna tell me
starting right now.

18:23.367 --> 18:26.636
I'm gonna go home and
I'm gonna get the whole
story of that cabin.

18:26.705 --> 18:30.741
And I'd better not find out
what I wanna find out.

18:30.809 --> 18:34.778
Ma, it's 10:00.
Why are you still cooking?

18:34.846 --> 18:37.614
I'm keeping the stew
warm for your father.

18:37.682 --> 18:41.251
He'll be hungry
when he comes home.
If he comes home.

18:41.319 --> 18:43.587
Oh, he'll come home all right.

18:43.654 --> 18:49.626
Your father ain't
never once missed
having his dinner at home.

18:49.694 --> 18:53.363
Ma, you're really something.
After the way daddy
walked out on you--

18:53.431 --> 18:57.768
Archie is right.
I shouldn't keep
secrets from him.

18:57.836 --> 19:01.205
The only reason
I don't tell him something
is for his own good.

19:01.272 --> 19:04.341
I want to protect him
from getting upset...

19:04.408 --> 19:06.509
And yelling at me.

19:09.513 --> 19:15.018
Ma, you know that weekend
you spent with Freddy withausen?
Yeah?

19:15.086 --> 19:17.287
Well,
[ Clears throat ]

to put this, but, uh,

uh, you know.

You don't think
that Freddy and me--
well?

19:32.904 --> 19:36.439
Oh, never.
It was during the war.

19:36.507 --> 19:39.076
And Freddy really respected me.

19:39.144 --> 19:44.381

and I was a red cross
bandage roller.

Okay, ma.

Oh, hello, Archie.
I kept your dinner warm.

20:04.468 --> 20:06.503
Never mind the dinner.

We're gonna have
a few words together

We've got some things
we're gonna have settled.

A lot of things. In fact,
the whole list of things
may keep us up all night.

20:23.254 --> 20:25.422
Whatever you say, Archie.

20:25.489 --> 20:28.158
Yeah.

20:28.226 --> 20:30.861
The first thing
we gotta talk about
is all this business...

20:30.929 --> 20:32.930
Of a secret service
going on around here...

20:32.997 --> 20:35.999
And I don't
know nothing, see?

20:36.067 --> 20:40.838
And the fact
that I'm the bread-winner
family here and the head.

20:40.905 --> 20:44.208
Things are going on
here without my consent,
and that's gotta change.

20:44.275 --> 20:46.043
If you say so.

20:48.213 --> 20:52.216
Then we're gonna have to
have a few words about
that unmoral weekend...

20:52.283 --> 20:54.952
You spent with that
tar watcher of yours.

20:55.019 --> 20:59.356
But, Archie, I told you--
and--

20:59.423 --> 21:02.659
let me finish.

21:02.727 --> 21:05.495
You're gonna have to
ask me to forgive you.

21:08.632 --> 21:11.568
All right.
Forgive me.

21:13.104 --> 21:15.138
Then you admit it, huh?

21:18.943 --> 21:21.544
There's nothing to admit.

21:21.612 --> 21:24.248
Then what are you asking me
to forgive you for?

21:24.315 --> 21:27.017
I don't know. You just
asked me to ask you to--

21:27.085 --> 21:30.553
<i>don't be twisting</i>
<i>all my words around, Edith.</i>

21:35.159 --> 21:38.028
All I want
is for you to say...

21:38.096 --> 21:41.765
That on our honeymoon night,
that night was the first.

21:43.067 --> 21:46.569
It was the night
after, remember?
You fell asleep.

21:46.637 --> 21:48.972
[ Inaudible ]

22:10.194 --> 22:15.465
Was I or was I not the first?

22:15.533 --> 22:18.802
Of course, Archie.

22:20.204 --> 22:22.139
All right then.

22:23.341 --> 22:25.508
You actually come
to your senses.

22:28.413 --> 22:32.082
- I forgive you.
- For what?

22:32.150 --> 22:37.087
Don't get started on that again.
We got it settled and I don't
wanna hear no more about it.

22:39.023 --> 22:40.958
Now you can go ahead
and serve me dinner.

22:41.025 --> 22:42.960
Right away, Archie.

22:43.027 --> 22:47.630
Gloria, dish up the stew.
And Mike, bring in the ketchup.

22:47.698 --> 22:52.635
Archie, does this mean
you ain't mad at me no more?

22:52.703 --> 22:57.540
Well, it means that
we got a few things
settled and, uh--

22:57.608 --> 23:00.643
one of which is no more
secrets around here, right?
Right.

23:00.711 --> 23:05.715
No more secrets.
I'll get your dinner right away.

23:08.152 --> 23:11.188
Ketchup on stew?

23:11.255 --> 23:13.523
- You'd eat ketchup on anything.
- Look who's talking.

23:13.591 --> 23:16.893
I once seen you dunk
a hamburger in a cup of coffee.

23:18.896 --> 23:22.199
How'd it go with ma?
Well, you can see
for yourself.

23:22.266 --> 23:24.334
Everything's back
to normal around here.

23:24.402 --> 23:28.771
It might interest you
to know that your mother-in-law
apologized to me.

23:30.274 --> 23:32.309
You mean then
that weekend she did?

23:32.377 --> 23:35.479
Didn't, didn't, didn't.

23:35.546 --> 23:38.281
- Well, what did she
apologize for?
- For nothing.

Archie and me had a long talk.

23:59.337 --> 24:03.306
And I ain't never
gonna keep a secret
from your father again.

24:03.374 --> 24:05.308
Well, the whole thing
was silly anyway.

24:05.376 --> 24:08.045
I mean, making
such a big deal about
a weekend in the country.

24:08.112 --> 24:10.514
Yeah, especially
when you had two
chaperones with you.

24:10.581 --> 24:15.318
Yeah, that's right.
Freddy and me was never alone
except for one afternoon...
