15:27.626 --> 15:31.964
Seems random.
Could be anything, Penny.

15:32.031 --> 15:33.966
A decoration
off a sweater.

15:34.033 --> 15:37.403
A cat toy.
Arts and crafts.

15:37.469 --> 15:38.971
I don't think it's random.

15:39.038 --> 15:41.040
This koala bear
is micro-crocheted.

15:41.106 --> 15:43.409
This artifact is
not machine-based.

15:43.475 --> 15:46.945
This kind of work requires
a steady hand and a patient eye.

15:47.012 --> 15:48.314
Micro-crocheting is a skill.

15:48.380 --> 15:49.481
It's a stretch.

15:49.548 --> 15:51.350
I just would hate
to see you go

15:51.417 --> 15:55.220
down a rabbit hole on a
half-baked hypothesis...

15:57.656 --> 16:00.626
Penny, I'm sorry.

16:00.693 --> 16:02.594
I'm talking to you
like I would my daughter.

16:02.661 --> 16:06.065
Uh, look, if you got
a gut on this,

16:06.131 --> 16:08.434
I'm not gonna stop you.
Bring it to DNA.

16:08.500 --> 16:10.336
Run it up a eucalyptus tree.

16:10.402 --> 16:12.538
♪ ♪

16:24.249 --> 16:26.418
♪ ♪

16:29.788 --> 16:31.357
Wow.
I'll be...

16:31.423 --> 16:32.424
Damned.

16:32.491 --> 16:34.293
Strike out on AFIS.

16:34.360 --> 16:36.528
Killer's prints aren't
in the system,

16:36.595 --> 16:38.430
but the sweat from
the bloody hand

16:38.497 --> 16:42.034
matches the skin cells found in
the micro threads of the koala.

16:42.101 --> 16:45.337
So, it's one of
two possibilities.

16:45.404 --> 16:48.774
Either it fell out of one of the
killers' pockets accidentally.

16:48.841 --> 16:50.542
Or it was dropped on purpose.

16:51.610 --> 16:55.114
If it was intentional,
maybe that bloody handprint

16:55.180 --> 16:57.516
was left behind
to ensure we found it.

16:57.583 --> 17:00.419
I don't get it. What is
the deal with this killer

17:00.486 --> 17:02.187
and this pregnant daughter?

17:02.254 --> 17:04.690
I did some googling
after I found the koala.

17:04.757 --> 17:08.460
Take a look at
a real koala's paw.

17:08.527 --> 17:10.329
FINADO:
Hmm.

17:10.396 --> 17:11.764
See, by the look of
this bloody hand,

17:11.830 --> 17:14.700
I would say the killer suffered
some sort of birth defect.

17:14.767 --> 17:17.136
Or dislocation between
the carpometacarpal joint

17:17.202 --> 17:19.671
of the index digit.

17:19.738 --> 17:22.674
Scientifically speaking. Sure.

17:22.741 --> 17:24.376
But I have a
different theory.

17:24.443 --> 17:26.078
This could be a cry for help.

17:26.145 --> 17:27.179
How do you mean?

17:27.246 --> 17:28.313
I think

17:28.380 --> 17:30.215
the killer who's getting
picked on in our footage...

17:32.885 --> 17:34.653
...wants to get caught.

17:37.523 --> 17:40.192
(grunts, panting)

17:40.259 --> 17:41.827
Okay.

17:41.894 --> 17:45.431
So that's what it feels like
to get hit by Mike Tyson.

17:50.169 --> 17:51.303
Firing!

17:52.204 --> 17:54.072
Oh...
Ah!

17:54.139 --> 17:55.441
(chuckles)
Whoa.

17:55.507 --> 17:56.842
That's a lot of weapon.

17:56.909 --> 17:58.644
(sighs)

17:58.710 --> 18:00.312
You'd think with
that kind of firepower,

18:00.379 --> 18:02.548
they'd have a better handle
on the kickback.

18:02.614 --> 18:04.716
We're experienced and we can
barely keep our balance.

18:04.783 --> 18:07.586
Speak for yourself,
Weeble Wobble.

18:07.653 --> 18:09.721
Hey, based on
the neighbor's footage,

18:09.788 --> 18:10.923
I'd say one of two things.

18:10.989 --> 18:13.792
Either the killer has never
fired the weapon, or...

18:13.859 --> 18:15.661
they didn't have the strength
to handle the weapon.

18:15.727 --> 18:16.895
Excuse me.
What are you saying?

18:16.962 --> 18:19.631
In the footage, you can see them
struggling with the firearms.

18:19.698 --> 18:22.401
I'm thinking that the killers
are inexperienced.

18:22.468 --> 18:23.836
They didn't know how powerful
the shotgun was

18:23.902 --> 18:25.437
until they pulled the trigger.

18:25.504 --> 18:29.708
And apparently they didn't
think to clean up their brass.

18:29.775 --> 18:31.276
I mean, they left us
that shell casing.

18:31.343 --> 18:32.644
Hey, run this through NIBIN.

18:32.711 --> 18:34.213
Let's see if we can get a name.

18:35.614 --> 18:37.149
CHAVEZ:
Edward Allen.

18:37.216 --> 18:40.118
You were arrested
a few months ago

18:40.185 --> 18:42.454
for discharging a high-powered
shotgun in your backyard.

18:42.521 --> 18:45.524
Yeah, that Karen neighbor
of mine ratted me out.

18:45.591 --> 18:47.759
Pled no contest.
Paid a small fine. So what?

18:47.826 --> 18:51.129
So, you never handed over
the firearm in question.

18:51.196 --> 18:54.399
And then it ends up being
used to kill four people.

18:54.466 --> 18:57.369
According to your disciplinary
file from your former employer,

18:57.436 --> 18:59.872
you were a cannabis grower
for Geice Farms.

18:59.938 --> 19:01.240
Mm-hmm.

19:01.306 --> 19:02.641
The CEO, Mr. Geice, fired you

19:02.708 --> 19:05.143
for selling illicit drugs
on property.

19:05.210 --> 19:08.146
WILLOWS:
Then what happened?
Paid your boss back

19:08.213 --> 19:09.882
by taking out his entire family?

19:09.948 --> 19:11.517
Brought a couple of thugs
to his house last night

19:11.583 --> 19:14.419
to rob him and send a message?

19:14.486 --> 19:16.555
Look, man. Geice's just like
any other multimillionaire

19:16.622 --> 19:17.789
in this town.

19:17.856 --> 19:20.826
He's a bigger criminal
than me. So what?

19:20.893 --> 19:22.928
He can make money selling drugs,
but I can't?

19:22.995 --> 19:24.696
Law enforcement found
shell casings in your backyard

19:24.763 --> 19:25.831
but never the gun in question.

19:25.898 --> 19:29.401
Care to explain how your
shotgun ended up in the hands

19:29.468 --> 19:31.537
of cold-blooded killers?
You're the cops.

19:31.603 --> 19:32.838
You tell me.

19:33.972 --> 19:35.374
Look, if I'm guilty of anything,

19:35.440 --> 19:38.343
I'm guilty of selling
a shotgun on the street.

19:38.410 --> 19:39.845
Sold three of 'em,

19:39.912 --> 19:42.114
actually.
Three of them?

19:43.782 --> 19:46.451
Can you provide a description
of the people you sold them to?

19:46.518 --> 19:47.886
I never met 'em.

19:47.953 --> 19:51.523
Money's green. I don't ask.

19:51.590 --> 19:52.891
They don't tell.

19:52.958 --> 19:56.228
Plus, I'm on house arrest.
Check your records.

19:56.295 --> 20:00.465
WILLOWS:
Whoever you sold those guns
to put you on the hook, too.

20:11.977 --> 20:13.512
What's on your mind?

20:13.579 --> 20:14.980
You think he has ties
to that infant?

20:15.047 --> 20:16.481
(door closes)
There's only one way
to find out.

20:16.548 --> 20:18.483
Max is at Desert Palm, right?

20:18.550 --> 20:19.985
Same hospital
as "Baby Doe."

20:20.052 --> 20:22.654
She has connections at CPS.

20:31.630 --> 20:33.966
Make it quick.
She's critical-to-stable.

20:34.032 --> 20:37.402
Not out of the woods yet.
Thank you. Thank you, Mary.

20:37.469 --> 20:39.738
(baby cooing)

20:49.815 --> 20:52.618
Hold still, little Baby Doe.

20:52.684 --> 20:56.321
Just want to get a swab.

20:56.388 --> 20:58.690
There you go.

21:02.728 --> 21:05.664
Thank you so much.
Thank you.

21:08.567 --> 21:10.702
(indistinct chatter)

21:13.739 --> 21:14.840
Director Roby.

21:14.906 --> 21:16.642
Good to have you back.

21:16.708 --> 21:18.577
(hushed chatter)

21:24.049 --> 21:25.851
You're back.

21:28.020 --> 21:29.287
Your swab.

21:29.354 --> 21:31.957
Your chain
of custody.

21:34.359 --> 21:35.794
Go. Run it.

21:41.033 --> 21:43.402
No-brainer: Edward Allen
isn't the father.

21:43.468 --> 21:45.570
But mind-bender...
Hmm?

21:45.637 --> 21:48.473
Juliet Geice, the pregnant
woman, isn't the mother either.

21:48.540 --> 21:49.708
Come again?

21:49.775 --> 21:51.777
Baby Doe has zero
or no biological ties

21:51.843 --> 21:54.346
to Edward Allen or Juliet Geice.

21:54.413 --> 21:56.915
So, our pregnant daughter
is either

21:56.982 --> 21:58.684
a surrogate or
a gestational carrier.

21:58.750 --> 22:01.787
Yeah, it also means that the
father is out there somewhere.

22:01.853 --> 22:03.422
Wait-wait-wait a minute,
wait a minute.

22:03.488 --> 22:05.590
This tooth from
one of the killers

22:05.657 --> 22:10.362
shares an allele with
that infant at Desert Palm.

22:10.429 --> 22:14.032
Which means, DNA-wise,
one of our killers is a female

22:14.099 --> 22:16.902
and the biological mother
of the infant.

22:16.968 --> 22:21.339
So we've got a killer mother and
an unknown father in the wind?

22:21.406 --> 22:24.476
With a child's life
still hanging in the balance.

22:24.543 --> 22:25.677
Catherine.

22:25.744 --> 22:27.412
Yeah.
Max.

22:27.479 --> 22:29.681
Yeah.
Shots fired in Henderson.

22:29.748 --> 22:31.049
Entire family's dead.

22:31.116 --> 22:33.351
Initial reports--
shotgun fire.

22:33.418 --> 22:34.886
Four more bodies en route
to the morgue.

22:38.423 --> 22:40.392
TECH:
The entire family was zip-tied.

22:40.459 --> 22:42.994
Same M.O.
Bound with zip ties.

22:43.061 --> 22:44.629
Facedown executions.

22:44.696 --> 22:47.399
First the Geices.
Now the Einsteens.

22:47.466 --> 22:48.400
What's the connection?

22:48.467 --> 22:50.635
Motive at the first scene
was robbery-homicide.

22:50.702 --> 22:53.071
This was just homicide.
The killers are escalating.

22:53.138 --> 22:55.140
TECH:
Here's the last victim.

22:57.843 --> 23:00.746
Folsom's tooth was spot-on.

23:00.812 --> 23:02.748
One of the killers is a woman.

23:04.683 --> 23:09.020
Okay. So, two homicidal
home invasions

23:09.087 --> 23:12.023
carried out in the
exact same fashion.

23:12.090 --> 23:13.992
With one difference.
Hmm?

23:14.059 --> 23:14.960
Of the three killers,

23:15.026 --> 23:16.862
one of them was found dead
at the crime scene.

23:18.463 --> 23:19.598
But all three residents
have their hands

23:19.664 --> 23:21.099
tied behind their backs.

23:21.166 --> 23:23.502
So it begs the question...

23:23.568 --> 23:25.804
Who killed the killer?

23:32.511 --> 23:33.812
WILLOWS:
You've got to be kidding me.

23:34.646 --> 23:36.815
There's no hit in AFIS.
No missing tooth.

23:36.882 --> 23:38.650
No ID on the bloody handprint.

23:38.717 --> 23:40.952
I mean, what is with this case?
Are we ever gonna catch a break?

23:42.754 --> 23:45.056
Catherine, when's the last time
you took a break?

23:45.123 --> 23:47.526
I'll take a break when
this case is over.

23:47.592 --> 23:49.427
Listen, I don't want
to get in your business,

23:49.494 --> 23:51.029
but I'm about to get
all in your business.

23:51.096 --> 23:52.864
Max, I'm fine.

23:52.931 --> 23:54.900
Really.
You're here but you're not here.

23:54.966 --> 23:57.969
Something's up. Is it
the case? Is it Grace?

23:58.036 --> 23:59.771
Did you find some new angle
with your missing friend?

23:59.838 --> 24:01.840
You can tell me.

24:01.907 --> 24:03.809
It's my daughter Lindsey.

24:03.875 --> 24:05.644
She's just not
returning my calls.

24:05.710 --> 24:07.646
She's got me on "block."

24:07.712 --> 24:11.817
Every time I text her,
it's green, green, green.

24:11.883 --> 24:14.853
I mean, I consider myself
a fairly together person,

24:14.920 --> 24:17.122
but I just become
this crazy stalker

24:17.189 --> 24:20.525
when it comes to her.
You know, just-- Is she hurt?

24:20.592 --> 24:25.096
Is she alive? Just constantly
checking my phone

24:25.163 --> 24:28.233
to receive that coveted,
elusive blue text from her

24:28.300 --> 24:30.969
saying... something.

24:31.036 --> 24:33.071
Anything.
Listen.

24:33.138 --> 24:36.141
I need you to take a few hours
off and go see your daughter.

24:36.208 --> 24:37.943
She's not going to see me.

24:38.009 --> 24:39.511
Then neither are we.

24:39.578 --> 24:43.815
You are not to report back
for at least a few hours.

24:43.882 --> 24:45.951
Please don't take me
off this case.

24:46.017 --> 24:47.953
I want you here.

24:48.019 --> 24:50.522
Take a break.

24:50.589 --> 24:52.624
Life's too short.

24:52.691 --> 24:55.493
Know what I mean?

24:59.331 --> 25:00.966
Hey, Max.

25:01.032 --> 25:03.168
Yeah?
Look.

25:03.235 --> 25:06.271
It's another bloody handprint.
Same abnormality.

25:06.338 --> 25:08.707
I bet there's another koala
around here somewhere.

25:11.243 --> 25:13.245
Okay.

25:18.617 --> 25:19.584
How is that possible?

25:19.651 --> 25:20.852
Penny...
It's too specific

25:20.919 --> 25:23.088
of a signature not to be here.
Penny...

25:23.154 --> 25:25.657
The koala and the handprint
go hand in hand.

25:25.724 --> 25:26.758
Paw to paw, so to speak...

25:26.825 --> 25:28.059
Penny.
Hi.

25:28.126 --> 25:30.295
Yes. Sorry.
You need to focus

25:30.362 --> 25:33.965
on the evidence you find.
Not on what you hope to find.

25:40.205 --> 25:41.907
(sighs)

25:45.610 --> 25:48.113
You're lucky I
checked my messages.

25:48.179 --> 25:50.882
Here you go.
I'm not gonna be here that long.

25:50.949 --> 25:51.883
Lindsey,

25:51.950 --> 25:53.885
you're alive.

25:53.952 --> 25:56.221
Should have ordered
two champagnes to toast.

25:56.288 --> 25:59.658
I showed up, didn't I?

25:59.724 --> 26:02.894
I'm not staying to eat.
I'm late for a shoot.

26:02.961 --> 26:04.863
A shoot.

26:04.930 --> 26:06.998
Is this the same shoot that

26:07.065 --> 26:08.934
you bailed
on the CSI job for?

26:09.000 --> 26:10.835
I already told you.

26:10.902 --> 26:14.239
Joining CSI was me fulfilling
your dream. Not mine.

26:16.041 --> 26:18.677
And what is your dream, Linds?

26:18.743 --> 26:21.079
Being half dressed
on a webcam

26:21.146 --> 26:23.581
and charging strangers
to be your fans?

26:23.648 --> 26:27.252
You have a young daughter
at home, my granddaughter.

26:27.319 --> 26:29.721
Wow, you have some nerve.

26:29.788 --> 26:31.022
"Linda Winston."

26:31.089 --> 26:34.025
That was your
dance name, right?

26:36.094 --> 26:39.197
Yes. It was.

26:39.264 --> 26:41.866
It was a long time ago.

26:41.933 --> 26:44.169
I was single. I did
what I had to do to survive.

26:45.203 --> 26:47.205
I'm sorry. I'm your mother.

26:47.272 --> 26:48.873
I love you.
I just don't want strange men

26:48.940 --> 26:50.175
seeing you half naked
for money.

26:50.241 --> 26:53.311
Oh, but strange men can grope
you in the back of the VIP room

26:53.378 --> 26:55.647
in real life, but that's okay?

26:55.714 --> 27:00.285
Mom, I make ten times in a month
than I ever could in a year

27:00.352 --> 27:01.953

and chasing down scumbags.

27:02.020 --> 27:04.889
Why did you even
call me, Mom?

27:04.956 --> 27:07.659
We have been over this
a million times.

27:07.726 --> 27:11.396
I'm-I'm working
a really tough case.

27:11.463 --> 27:15.934

some mother/daughter fuel.

27:16.001 --> 27:18.870
Yeah, well, I'm not your
emotional gas station

27:18.937 --> 27:21.673
that you can just
fill up at whenever you want.

27:24.809 --> 27:27.045
I mean, has it ever
occurred to you

27:27.112 --> 27:30.181
that maybe I need some
daughter/mother fuel?

27:30.248 --> 27:32.117

from her mother.

Name it.

27:38.790 --> 27:43.695
No! I can't.

27:46.431 --> 27:48.299
My problem is,
is I don't have the courage

27:48.366 --> 27:50.435
to say the three words
that I have to say to you.

27:50.502 --> 27:53.371
And what's that? "I hate you"?

27:53.438 --> 27:55.673
No.

27:55.740 --> 27:59.677
It's the three words
that keep me going when...

27:59.744 --> 28:02.013
when life gets to be too much.

28:05.316 --> 28:07.919

you, you're never gonna know.

28:18.997 --> 28:21.132

Mm.

Who's the odd man out
on the upper left?

30:29.661 --> 30:32.030
Turns out, the Geice family
didn't have

30:32.096 --> 30:33.398
any other family members
in Vegas.

Well, then,
who's the mystery man

30:36.901 --> 30:42.040
Lucky for us, TSA also has
their own Magic Eye database.

30:48.246 --> 30:51.049
Justin Einsteen.
I'm Detective Chavez.

30:51.115 --> 30:53.484
CSI Willows.
Mr. Einsteen,

30:53.551 --> 30:57.255
this woman was also killed
at your parents' home.

30:57.322 --> 30:58.890
Do you know who this is?
JUSTIN: No.

30:58.957 --> 31:01.392
I've never seen this woman
in my life.

31:02.527 --> 31:04.996
This is Juliet Geice.

31:05.063 --> 31:07.932
Who was pregnant at the time
she was murdered

31:07.999 --> 31:10.468
at the Geice residence where
we found several photographs

31:10.535 --> 31:12.403
in which you appear
alongside her.

31:12.470 --> 31:16.207
What is your relationship
to her and her baby?

31:17.942 --> 31:19.143
(scoffs)

31:21.112 --> 31:23.915
I'm the father.

31:25.717 --> 31:28.086
I'd start talking
if I were you.

31:28.152 --> 31:31.923
Juliet approached me
about having a baby.

31:31.990 --> 31:33.524
Her and I are close.
We're like family.

31:33.591 --> 31:36.894
Well, you are family.
Look...

31:38.363 --> 31:40.498
Juliet had our baby?

31:41.733 --> 31:45.036
Look, I'm sorry, uh,
I don't understand.

31:45.103 --> 31:48.573
I-I-I... I thought you said
Juliet had died.

31:48.640 --> 31:52.343
Juliet died at the scene,
but your baby girl didn't.

31:54.412 --> 31:57.248
She's fighting for her life
at Desert Palm.

31:58.082 --> 32:01.085
And you think I would shoot
the mother of my child?

32:04.022 --> 32:05.623
So, you were the sperm donor.

32:05.690 --> 32:08.192
And Juliet was the surrogate.

32:08.259 --> 32:10.495
Gestational carrier.

32:11.596 --> 32:15.199
A surrogate uses her own eggs
when carrying a child.

32:15.266 --> 32:18.202
Juliet had bad oocytes.

32:18.269 --> 32:20.271
So Lucia donated her eggs.

32:20.338 --> 32:23.708
After all, they were
the ones in love.

32:23.775 --> 32:26.277
Not me.
CHAVEZ: Wait a minute. Back up.

32:26.344 --> 32:27.712
Lucia?

32:27.779 --> 32:30.548
The infant's
biological mother?

32:30.615 --> 32:32.050
This woman?

32:32.116 --> 32:34.419
No. That's not Lucia.

32:35.386 --> 32:39.691
My fear is, the woman in this
photo is one of her sisters.

32:39.757 --> 32:41.959
Sisters?

32:42.026 --> 32:44.062
Lucia has sisters. Two sisters.

32:44.128 --> 32:47.565
They're fraternal triplets,
if I remember correct.

32:48.599 --> 32:52.103
This Lucia that you speak of--
she have a last name?

32:52.170 --> 32:53.971
Lucia Marshman.

32:54.038 --> 32:55.540
She have a last
known address?

32:55.606 --> 32:58.109
Can I check my phone?

32:58.176 --> 33:02.647
I drove there to pick Lucia up
and bring her to Juliet's house.

33:02.714 --> 33:05.083
(sighs)

33:05.149 --> 33:08.152
Juliet couldn't go to
Lucia's home for fear

33:08.219 --> 33:10.688
of blowing the secret with
her other sisters. Am I right?

33:10.755 --> 33:12.523

And that she's
accepting visitors.
