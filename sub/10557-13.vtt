Murdoch Mysteries S02E13

00:50.300 --> 00:52.100
What on earth
are you doing here

00:52.301 --> 00:53.381
in British Columbia, Father?

00:53.581 --> 00:55.179
I understand how you might --

00:55.379 --> 00:57.660
you might have a few questions for me.

00:57.860 --> 00:59.060
A few questions?

00:59.261 --> 01:00.741
You bet I have a few.

01:00.941 --> 01:02.222
If you give me a moment here,

01:02.423 --> 01:04.539
I'll do my best to come up
with an explanation.

01:04.739 --> 01:06.019
Aha!

01:06.219 --> 01:07.942
Ow! Oh! Oh!

01:09.140 --> 01:10.542
I believe an explanation
is in order,

01:10.741 --> 01:12.101
but now might not be
the best time.

01:12.302 --> 01:15.060
Why are they shooting at me?
It's got to be your fault.

01:15.260 --> 01:16.741
My fault?

01:16.942 --> 01:17.781
If it wasn't for you,

01:17.981 --> 01:20.581
I never would have considered
coming out here for one moment.

01:20.782 --> 01:24.261
That's not precisely true.

01:24.461 --> 01:26.341
I believe your commitment
to the murder investigation

01:26.541 --> 01:27.623
was an equally important factor.

01:27.823 --> 01:30.140
Was it, now?

01:36.902 --> 01:39.020
- Morning, sir.
- Morning, George.

01:39.220 --> 01:40.221
This one appears to be
an accident.

01:40.420 --> 01:41.501
I wouldn't have called for you at all,

01:41.701 --> 01:42.702
except you've been requested
by name.

01:42.902 --> 01:43.702
By whom?

01:43.902 --> 01:45.783
I haven't met the chap.
Higgins has.

01:45.981 --> 01:46.782
Well, whoever he is,

01:46.983 --> 01:48.701
he'll have to wait
until I see the victim.

01:48.901 --> 01:50.142
Do we have a name?

01:50.341 --> 01:52.222
Humphrey Breen.
He's a geologist.

01:52.422 --> 01:53.744
Geologist.

01:53.944 --> 01:57.701
Also seems to be
an avid butterfly collector.

01:57.900 --> 02:00.461
Spicebush swallowtail.
Extremely rare.

02:00.661 --> 02:02.303
Well, it would appear
he fell out of the window

02:02.502 --> 02:03.943
while capturing it, sir.

02:04.143 --> 02:06.260
Hmm.

02:06.461 --> 02:07.502
Sir.

02:07.703 --> 02:09.901
I've been ordered not to let anything
be disturbed.

02:10.102 --> 02:12.343
On whose authority, Henry?

02:13.424 --> 02:16.662
Thank you so much for these
very keen observations.

02:16.862 --> 02:18.263
We greatly appreciate the aid

02:18.463 --> 02:20.703
of an informed
and conscientious citizenry.

02:20.904 --> 02:23.982
Ah, Detective Murdoch,
I presume.

02:24.182 --> 02:25.023
Yes, I am.

02:25.221 --> 02:26.301
And who might you be?

02:26.502 --> 02:29.063
Sergeant Jasper Linney,
of the Northwest Mounted Police,

02:29.264 --> 02:30.103
at your service.

02:30.303 --> 02:32.301
What exactly are you doing?

02:32.502 --> 02:35.462
Interviewing
the victim's neighbors.

02:35.663 --> 02:37.863
And I shall be happy to share
my interview notes with you

02:38.063 --> 02:38.865
in due time.

02:39.065 --> 02:42.143
But first we must learn
what we can from the body.

02:42.343 --> 02:44.304
We?

02:44.504 --> 02:45.704
There is no "we."

02:45.903 --> 02:47.905
The Northwest Mounted Police
has no jurisdiction here.

02:48.104 --> 02:50.223
Now, I must insist on
an explanation immediately.

02:50.422 --> 02:52.342
The victim
is alleged to have fallen

02:52.543 --> 02:53.944
from the third-story window --

02:54.144 --> 02:56.265
An explanation
as to what you're doing here

02:56.463 --> 02:58.183
and why you've inserted yourself
in this case.

02:58.383 --> 03:00.103
Of course.

03:00.303 --> 03:01.904
I am investigating a murder.

03:02.103 --> 03:03.303
A murder?

03:03.504 --> 03:05.065
Where? When?

03:05.265 --> 03:07.703
Six days ago, in Chilliwack Landing,
British Columbia.

03:07.903 --> 03:10.504
- British Columbia?
- Yes.

03:10.703 --> 03:13.026
And you believe this death
in British Columbia

03:13.225 --> 03:15.105
to somehow be related
to Mr. Breen's?

03:15.306 --> 03:16.303
I do.

03:16.502 --> 03:18.424
I see.

03:18.624 --> 03:20.825
Sergeant, I must insist
that you terminate

03:21.024 --> 03:23.745
your interference in this investigation
immediately

03:23.945 --> 03:26.023
and keep yourself available
for questioning.

03:26.223 --> 03:27.784
Of course.

03:27.984 --> 03:30.106
And I shall be requiring
your presence

03:30.305 --> 03:32.906
for interviewing as well,
Detective Murdoch.

03:39.946 --> 03:40.906
I believe the shooter

03:41.107 --> 03:43.744
is approximately 30 yards
away from us to the southwest.

03:43.944 --> 03:46.265
The shooters -- And there are
at least three of them --

03:46.464 --> 03:48.905
are approximately 45 yards
from here to the southeast.

03:50.906 --> 03:54.305
For Christ's sakes,
they're shooting at the front.

03:54.505 --> 03:56.386
We got to go out the back.

04:00.185 --> 04:02.705
Okay, boys, there she is.

04:02.905 --> 04:04.586
All right.
Ready?

04:10.144 --> 04:11.065
Back!

04:11.266 --> 04:14.106
Well, geniuses, it looks like
we got four shooters

04:14.306 --> 04:15.786
out there now, doesn't it?

04:15.986 --> 04:18.744
And they all want us dead.

04:29.146 --> 04:29.946
Boys.

04:30.146 --> 04:32.268
I'm deadly with a gun.

04:32.467 --> 04:34.507
Give us one.

04:34.708 --> 04:38.106
My sidearm is our entire arsenal,
I'm afraid.

04:38.305 --> 04:40.306
What?
Didn't you bring a gun?

04:40.507 --> 04:42.787
What kind of copper are you?

04:42.987 --> 04:45.307
In Toronto, police detectives
do not carry sidearms.

04:45.506 --> 04:47.866
Further, I use my powers
of deduction to solve crime.

04:48.067 --> 04:52.068
Well, it's too bad you didn't think
to bring a gun.

04:52.269 --> 04:55.266
Might I suggest you try thinking
of something more productive?

04:55.467 --> 04:58.427
Perhaps a way
of evening the odds?

04:58.628 --> 05:01.906
You know what? I was poking around
in the mining office.

05:02.106 --> 05:03.905
They got explosives in there.

05:04.106 --> 05:06.107
Explosives?

05:06.308 --> 05:08.267
That might give us
a fighting chance, huh?

05:08.468 --> 05:10.068
If they're still good.

05:10.268 --> 05:13.547
Who knows how old they are?

05:13.747 --> 05:15.187
What are you doing?

05:15.387 --> 05:17.389
Gonna stick a fork in them?

05:17.588 --> 05:20.307
Oh, he was like that
the whole way from Toronto.

05:22.309 --> 05:23.508
Yeah, you're daydreaming,
aren't you?

05:23.707 --> 05:24.949
You were like that
as a little fella.

05:25.149 --> 05:29.506
It's like he's thinking of something,
or perhaps someone,

05:29.706 --> 05:32.187
other than this case.

05:39.107 --> 05:40.108
Ooh.

05:41.388 --> 05:44.509
Thank you for an absolutely
exhilarating experience.

05:44.710 --> 05:47.388
Oh, it was truly my pleasure.

05:47.589 --> 05:49.107
Shall we do it again later?

05:49.308 --> 05:50.669
That would be wonderful.

05:50.870 --> 05:53.150
Until then.

05:57.948 --> 06:00.149
What do you have for me, Detective,
on this glorious day?

06:00.347 --> 06:03.348
A fall
from a third-story window.

06:03.547 --> 06:05.148
The result of an apparent
overzealous attempt

06:05.349 --> 06:06.708
at capturing a butterfly.

06:06.909 --> 06:08.350
An accident?

06:08.550 --> 06:11.430
I assure you
this was no accident.

06:11.630 --> 06:14.828
Sergeant Jasper Linney, ma'am,
at your service.

06:15.028 --> 06:17.229
Dr. Julia Ogden.

06:17.429 --> 06:19.151
And why do you think
this man was murdered?

06:19.351 --> 06:21.028
There is no evidence
that this was a murder.

06:21.227 --> 06:23.308
There's no signs
of breaking and entering.

06:23.509 --> 06:24.590
No footprints inside or out.

06:24.789 --> 06:25.868
And the victim's housekeeper

06:26.068 --> 06:27.510
insists that nothing
was disturbed.

06:27.710 --> 06:29.948
And yet I must insist
that you treat Mr. Breen

06:30.148 --> 06:31.828
as the victim
of a heinous crime.

06:32.028 --> 06:33.511
Based on what?

06:33.710 --> 06:34.949
The other victim.

06:35.149 --> 06:37.149
There's another victim?

06:37.350 --> 06:38.590
What are you talking about?

06:38.789 --> 06:41.590
The spicebush swallowtail.

06:41.790 --> 06:44.311
It was also murdered.

06:50.790 --> 06:53.912
I believe I can make everything
abundantly clear.

06:54.110 --> 06:56.071
It all began with the death
of Uriah Doakes

06:56.270 --> 06:57.109
in British Columbia.

06:57.308 --> 07:01.550
Mr. Doakes was last seen in the company
of Mr. Humphrey Breen.

07:01.751 --> 07:03.911
An assayer, Mr. Doakes
was hired by Mr. Breen,

07:04.112 --> 07:05.949
most likely to evaluate
an ore sample.

07:06.149 --> 07:08.630
And how exactly did
Mr. Doakes die, Sergeant?

07:08.830 --> 07:09.631
Ah.

07:09.832 --> 07:12.752
That is where matters
become extremely interesting.

07:12.952 --> 07:16.390
I have here
the coroner's report.

07:16.591 --> 07:18.551
If you will.

07:21.431 --> 07:23.069
Mr. Doakes was drunk,

07:23.270 --> 07:24.912
unfortunately passed out
on rail road tracks.

07:25.111 --> 07:26.390
Another untimely death.

07:26.591 --> 07:28.270
But accidental, it would seem.

07:28.471 --> 07:29.912
Ah, but you see,

07:30.113 --> 07:34.231
Mr. Doakes, he hadn't touched
a drop in years.

07:34.430 --> 07:36.512
A moment of weakness, perhaps.

07:36.712 --> 07:37.512
Possibly.

07:37.712 --> 07:39.952
But based on rigor mortis,
I suspect he was dead

07:40.153 --> 07:42.549
even before he found himself
on those train tracks.

07:42.750 --> 07:44.912
There's nothing about that
in this report.

07:45.112 --> 07:47.833
I base that assumption
on my personal examination

07:48.032 --> 07:50.472
of Mr. Doakes' left arm
at the crime scene.

07:50.672 --> 07:53.032
His left arm?
Sergeant, why his left arm?

07:53.232 --> 07:55.393
Because that was the largest part
of Mr. Doakes still intact.

07:55.593 --> 07:57.673
Well, that is
extremely interesting.

07:57.871 --> 08:00.792
Mr. Doakes' arm was encased
in part of a jacket.

08:00.993 --> 08:03.272
In a pocket was a business card

08:03.473 --> 08:06.711
with the name and address
of a Toronto policeman.

08:06.911 --> 08:10.792
A Detective William Murdoch.

08:14.272 --> 08:17.311
Curious.
I've never met this man before.

08:17.511 --> 08:19.033
Nevertheless, sir,
he did have your card,

08:19.232 --> 08:20.633
and that is also
extremely interesting.

08:20.833 --> 08:22.433
Thank you, George.

08:22.632 --> 08:25.311
So, based on this, you decided to travel
all the way to Toronto

08:25.512 --> 08:26.313
to investigate?

08:26.513 --> 08:28.793
I have made a pledge of honor
to myself.

08:28.993 --> 08:31.834
When a crime is committed,
I will always get my man.

08:33.511 --> 08:35.513
- Murdoch.
- Inspector.

08:35.712 --> 08:38.393
A word.

08:43.192 --> 08:44.113
I've just had a quick chat

08:44.313 --> 08:45.953
with Sergeant Linney's
commanding officer.

08:46.154 --> 08:48.433
He requested that we extend him
every courtesy

08:48.633 --> 08:50.075
while we look
into Breen's death.

08:50.274 --> 08:52.874
Sir, I will do my best
to cooperate with the sergeant,

08:53.073 --> 08:55.595
but he must remember that he is
in our jurisdiction.

08:55.795 --> 08:58.675
I'm sure I can count on you
to remind him of that.

08:58.875 --> 09:01.474
Yes, you can, sir.

09:01.673 --> 09:03.633
And he also said
that while it's bloody annoying,

09:03.834 --> 09:05.154
the man is almost never wrong.

09:06.715 --> 09:09.113
I can't imagine having to put up
with this kind of behavior

09:09.313 --> 09:11.354
on a regular basis.

09:11.553 --> 09:12.914
Yet somehow I can.

09:13.115 --> 09:14.314
Sir.

09:14.514 --> 09:17.115
I've been thinking
about Sergeant Linney's statement

09:17.313 --> 09:19.113
that he "always gets his man."

09:19.314 --> 09:20.874
It has a nice ring to it.

09:21.075 --> 09:22.356
I think that could make
a catchy slogan

09:22.555 --> 09:23.755
for us here at Station Four.

09:23.955 --> 09:25.036
I don't think so, George.

09:25.235 --> 09:26.994
But, sir,
we do always get our man.

09:27.193 --> 09:30.434
Yes, but we don't feel the need
to boast about it.

09:30.634 --> 09:31.795
Where is Sergeant Linney?

09:31.995 --> 09:33.316
He's off to the morgue, sir.

09:33.516 --> 09:35.394
The morgue.

09:35.593 --> 09:37.314
Yes, he wanted to see
if he could be of assistance

09:37.515 --> 09:38.515
to Dr. Ogden.

09:38.714 --> 09:41.155
Of course he did.

09:42.996 --> 09:44.914
Inspector, does Sergeant Linney

09:45.115 --> 09:47.515
remind you of anybody
in particular?

09:47.716 --> 09:48.995
Yes, he does.

09:49.196 --> 09:52.317
Disturbingly so.

09:54.794 --> 09:57.155
So, you agree with my suspicion?

09:57.355 --> 09:58.315
To the untrained eye,

09:58.516 --> 10:01.075
there's no indication that
a crime has been committed.

10:01.274 --> 10:04.435
Oh, Detective, do join us.

10:04.635 --> 10:06.356
You'll be interested to know
I've ascertained

10:06.556 --> 10:08.557
that one of our victims
was murdered.

10:08.757 --> 10:10.234
Is there
the slightest possibility

10:10.435 --> 10:12.515
it's Mr. Breen?

10:13.396 --> 10:15.476
There is a tiny indentation

10:15.676 --> 10:19.396
where the butterfly's thorax
has been pinched.

10:19.594 --> 10:22.355
Sergeant Linney explained
it's a method used by collectors

10:22.556 --> 10:23.476
to stun their specimens.

10:23.675 --> 10:25.156
So there will be
no visible damage

10:25.355 --> 10:26.756
when the creature
is put on display.

10:26.957 --> 10:28.716
Yes, I'm familiar
with the practice.

10:28.916 --> 10:30.636
Well, I knew there was
something amiss

10:30.835 --> 10:32.117
when I smelled bitter almonds,

10:32.315 --> 10:34.197
suggesting poisoning
by potassium cyanide.

10:34.397 --> 10:36.715
Now, just a moment.
Mr. Breen had no such odor.

10:36.915 --> 10:38.316
And further, he would have been
reddish in color --

10:38.516 --> 10:42.477
Sergeant Linney was referring
to the butterfly, not Mr. Breen.

10:42.677 --> 10:45.514
Lepidopterists often use
potassium cyanide

10:45.715 --> 10:46.995
in crystalline form

10:47.196 --> 10:48.877
in the bottom
of butterfly killing jars.

10:49.077 --> 10:51.197
Actually, they pour water
over the crystals

10:51.396 --> 10:52.517
through plaster of Paris,

10:52.717 --> 10:55.197
releasing cyanide gas
which kills the butterflies.

10:55.395 --> 10:57.636
Regardless, gentlemen,

10:57.836 --> 11:00.118
how often does a collector
have the good fortune

11:00.318 --> 11:02.718
of capturing a butterfly
that's already dead?

11:05.477 --> 11:07.958
So Mr. Breen is pushed
out of the window, then?

11:08.157 --> 11:12.716
And the butterfly planted
in the net to allay our suspicion.

11:12.916 --> 11:16.117
So I should continue
my examination of Mr. Breen.

11:17.517 --> 11:20.199
Well, I look forward
to your results, Doctor.

11:20.398 --> 11:22.037
- Good day.
- Good day.

11:25.318 --> 11:27.238
Is there something else, Detective?

11:27.439 --> 11:28.239
Yes, there is.

11:28.439 --> 11:31.077
I was hoping to discuss
a certain matter with you.

11:31.278 --> 11:32.678
Of course.

11:32.878 --> 11:36.678
The topic
is of a personal nature.

11:36.879 --> 11:38.597
I see.

11:38.797 --> 11:41.118
Perhaps you should consider consulting
Mrs. Jones.

11:41.317 --> 11:43.237
That's part of what
I wanted to discuss.

11:43.438 --> 11:45.038
Oh?

11:45.239 --> 11:47.237
Ah, Julia.
Ah, Murdoch.

11:47.438 --> 11:48.877
Mr. Poundsett.

11:49.078 --> 11:51.517
I do hope I'm not intruding.

11:51.717 --> 11:53.200
No, not at all.

11:53.399 --> 11:55.159
I was just leaving.

11:55.360 --> 11:57.558
Perhaps we could continue this
at another time?

11:57.757 --> 12:00.959
Yes, of course.

12:03.960 --> 12:07.798
Humphrey was passionate
about his butterflies.

12:07.998 --> 12:10.799
I suppose if he had to die,

12:11.000 --> 12:13.958
that's the way
he'd have chosen to go.

12:14.157 --> 12:17.318
But why in the world are the police
looking into his death?

12:17.518 --> 12:20.519
I'm investigating
the possibility of foul play.

12:20.720 --> 12:22.002
I was wondering
if you might know of anyone

12:22.200 --> 12:22.997
wishing to cause him harm.

12:23.198 --> 12:25.639
No, no one.

12:25.839 --> 12:27.041
He certainly
never spoke of anything

12:27.239 --> 12:28.399
that one might interpret
that way.

12:28.600 --> 12:30.841
Do you know a Mr. Uriah Doakes?

12:31.042 --> 12:31.838
Doakes, the assayer.

12:32.038 --> 12:33.759
Does he have something to do with this?

12:33.957 --> 12:37.439
He was killed shortly after meeting
with Mr. Breen.

12:37.640 --> 12:39.161
Have you any idea
why the two might have met?

12:39.360 --> 12:40.359
Of course.

12:40.558 --> 12:42.719
Humphrey hired Doakes to do
an independent assessment

12:42.918 --> 12:43.760
of an ore sample.

12:43.960 --> 12:46.842
Ah, and this ore sample,
what can you tell us about it?

12:47.041 --> 12:49.720
It was for Arkona Mines.

12:49.920 --> 12:53.121
A sample from their operation
in Pringle Creek.

12:53.321 --> 12:56.561
Was there anything unusual
about this ore sample?

12:56.761 --> 12:58.559
Not to my knowledge.

12:58.760 --> 12:59.758
In fact, it was so ordinary

12:59.959 --> 13:02.161
that Humphrey didn't even bother
reporting the details

13:02.359 --> 13:04.802
when he returned.

13:06.359 --> 13:09.040
So, we have two men
killed mysteriously.

13:09.240 --> 13:10.719
Linked by an ore sample.

13:10.920 --> 13:12.763
That is apparently
of little significance.

13:12.962 --> 13:14.841
I don't care what you say.
We don't have any rats,

13:15.042 --> 13:16.161
and I won't be tricked
into paying for something

13:16.359 --> 13:19.640
we don't even need.
Now, off with you!

13:20.562 --> 13:21.883
May I be of assistance, madam?

13:22.082 --> 13:23.922
I don't need you sticking
your nose in

13:24.120 --> 13:25.319
where it doesn't belong.

13:26.921 --> 13:31.522
Yes, well,
where were we, Detective?

13:31.721 --> 13:33.839
Two men linked by an ore sample.

13:34.039 --> 13:35.522
And where there are ore samples,
there's often...

13:35.721 --> 13:36.640
Big money.

13:36.841 --> 13:38.722
Trust me, that's where this case
is gonna lead us.

13:38.922 --> 13:41.961
However, these ore samples
were apparently of little value.

13:42.160 --> 13:43.442
Or so this Vanderlay says.

13:43.642 --> 13:44.841
It would speak to motive.

13:45.040 --> 13:46.483
What else have we got to go on?

13:46.682 --> 13:47.882
The killer's modus operandi.

13:48.082 --> 13:50.124
Well-staged, well-researched.

13:50.324 --> 13:52.482
Murder with a personal touch.

13:52.681 --> 13:54.321
The murderer's enjoying himself.

13:54.521 --> 13:56.321
I suppose.

13:56.521 --> 13:59.122
This is starting to remind me
of something.

13:59.320 --> 14:00.521
I'm going to make
a few inquiries.

14:00.721 --> 14:02.721
And if I'm right, this case
just got a lot more dangerous,

14:02.922 --> 14:05.122
me old mucker.

14:13.323 --> 14:14.723
What are you doing
with that junk?

14:14.923 --> 14:17.041
You said to come up with a plan.

14:17.241 --> 14:18.882
What are you suggesting?

14:19.081 --> 14:21.522
You gonna invite them to dinner?

14:21.723 --> 14:23.323
Is that aluminium?

14:23.524 --> 14:24.523
Aluminium?

14:24.723 --> 14:26.762
It's a new metal
revolutionizing manufacturing.

14:26.963 --> 14:29.003
But more importantly,
it's the self-contained

14:29.203 --> 14:31.203
exothermic chemical reaction
that's possible

14:31.403 --> 14:32.644
when it's combined
with an oxidizer.

14:32.844 --> 14:35.043
Potassium perchlorate.

14:35.242 --> 14:37.002
We'll need to file down
the aluminium somehow.

14:37.203 --> 14:38.004
The livery.

14:38.204 --> 14:39.004
If there are any tools
to be found here,

14:39.203 --> 14:40.003
that would be the place.

14:40.203 --> 14:41.044
Livery?

14:41.244 --> 14:43.482
Oh, you'll be shot dead
as soon as you go out that door.

14:43.683 --> 14:44.442
I'll go first.

14:44.643 --> 14:47.042
No, I'll go first.

14:47.243 --> 14:49.204
Give me that.

14:53.083 --> 14:54.083
Let's go!

14:59.084 --> 15:00.286
Hurry up, Harry!

15:00.484 --> 15:02.242
Harry!

15:06.685 --> 15:08.766
I thought you said
you could handle a gun.

15:08.965 --> 15:10.043
I might need eyeglasses.

15:10.243 --> 15:12.324
Well, it's an ideal time
to discover that.

15:12.523 --> 15:14.925
All right, ready?

15:15.125 --> 15:16.163
Go!

15:18.723 --> 15:20.324
Hurry! Hurry!

15:20.524 --> 15:22.084
- Go! Go!
- Come on!

15:24.724 --> 15:25.925
Get down!

15:27.723 --> 15:28.925
Let's go, boys!

15:29.124 --> 15:30.565
Wait! Harry!

15:30.764 --> 15:31.724
Harry!

15:40.685 --> 15:41.565
Everyone all right?

15:41.765 --> 15:44.045
Fine, fine.

15:45.444 --> 15:47.204
Can you find a rasp?

15:47.404 --> 15:48.725
I got two.

15:48.925 --> 15:51.045
Harry, get down!

15:52.046 --> 15:53.606
Here, Harry.

15:53.806 --> 15:55.525
Start filing down the aluminium.

15:55.725 --> 15:57.965
You don't need eyeglasses
for that.

16:03.004 --> 16:04.885
Wait, wait.

16:05.084 --> 16:06.805
Use this to catch it all in.

16:14.005 --> 16:16.326
It's awful quiet out there.

16:16.526 --> 16:19.007
They're probably taking up
new positions.

16:21.886 --> 16:24.487
You poor fellas.

16:25.887 --> 16:27.126
I feel sorry for you, though.

16:27.327 --> 16:28.647
You must feel like
perfect fools, huh?

16:28.848 --> 16:29.885
Why is that?

16:30.086 --> 16:32.806
Leading those cutthroats here.

16:33.005 --> 16:35.807
Perhaps it wasn't us
who led the cutthroats here.

16:36.007 --> 16:37.248
I hope you don't think
it was me.

16:37.446 --> 16:38.245
Now, look here,

16:38.445 --> 16:40.685
we've traveled halfway
across this country

16:40.886 --> 16:42.007
to investigate a crime.

16:42.206 --> 16:45.087
And who just happens to be
right in the middle of things

16:45.287 --> 16:46.248
when the shooting starts?

16:46.447 --> 16:49.967
Oh, poor fella.
You still don't trust me, do ya?

16:51.527 --> 16:54.248
All right,
what are you doing here, Harry?

16:58.486 --> 16:59.646
Uriah Doakes.

16:59.847 --> 17:02.887
You knew him?

17:03.086 --> 17:04.167
Oh, yeah, I knew him
from the old days.

17:04.366 --> 17:09.247
And then I run into him in a bar
in Chilliwack Landing.

17:09.446 --> 17:10.446
He was drinking?

17:10.647 --> 17:12.929
No. A sarsaparilla.

17:13.127 --> 17:15.127
What's the matter with that?

17:16.487 --> 17:18.166
Uriah gave me a hot tip.

17:18.367 --> 17:21.410
He told me
that Arkona Mining Operation,

17:21.609 --> 17:24.726
they were going to be buying up land
around Pringle Creek.

17:24.926 --> 17:25.967
And, boy, I thought to myself,

17:26.166 --> 17:27.928
"Oh, that's a chance to get in
at the beginning.

17:28.128 --> 17:32.047
And make myself a dollar."

17:34.327 --> 17:36.609
Poor old Doakes.

17:37.889 --> 17:39.529
I guess he didn't know
what he was getting into.

17:39.726 --> 17:40.728
I'm sorry, gentlemen.

17:40.928 --> 17:41.968
I've never heard
of any Uriah Doakes.

17:42.168 --> 17:42.968
Should I know him?

17:43.169 --> 17:46.169
He was hired by Mr. Breen to evaluate
an Arkona ore sample.

17:46.370 --> 17:47.890
We're a very large operation, Detective.

17:48.090 --> 17:49.928
Forgive me if I don't remember
everyone we employ.

17:50.128 --> 17:52.369
Am I to understand you are unaware
of an assessment

17:52.568 --> 17:54.488
by Mr. Doakes regarding
your mine in Pringle Creek?

17:54.688 --> 17:55.489
Yes, that's right.

17:55.690 --> 17:57.367
Now, why are you asking me
all these questions?

17:57.568 --> 17:59.448
Mr. Fremont,
we have reason to believe

17:59.647 --> 18:00.889
that both men were murdered

18:01.089 --> 18:03.330
and their deaths
made to appear as accidents.

18:03.529 --> 18:06.488
Have you any idea why someone might want
to harm Mr. Doakes?

18:06.688 --> 18:08.328
As I said,
I didn't know the man.

18:08.529 --> 18:10.248
What about Mr. Breen?

18:10.449 --> 18:13.491
He was a fine geologist
and a convivial lunch companion.

18:13.689 --> 18:15.368
His firm had investigated
several promising sites for us

18:15.568 --> 18:16.567
over the years,

18:16.768 --> 18:18.330
but beyond that,
I have no knowledge of him.

18:19.728 --> 18:20.969
Now, if you'll excuse me...

18:21.170 --> 18:23.450
And you have
some basis, no doubt,

18:23.651 --> 18:25.168
on which to suspect Mr. Fremont?

18:25.368 --> 18:26.729
Of course,
it's not hard science,

18:26.930 --> 18:29.250
but I have observed that people
frequently look to the left

18:29.450 --> 18:30.450
when they are telling a lie.

18:30.649 --> 18:32.930
And I have frequently observed
that people look to the left

18:33.129 --> 18:36.489
when that is the direction
they are going in.

18:36.690 --> 18:38.851
Do you notice something
oddly similar with those two?

18:39.051 --> 18:41.292
Now that you mention it.

18:41.489 --> 18:42.528
Fascinating, Detective.

18:42.729 --> 18:45.128
Ah, George.

18:45.329 --> 18:47.010
I need you to find out
everything you can

18:47.210 --> 18:48.330
about an Arkona Mining operation

18:48.530 --> 18:50.129
in the interior
of British Columbia.

18:50.328 --> 18:51.849
Specifically, Pringle Creek.

18:53.329 --> 18:54.891
Yes, sir.
Sirs.

19:02.891 --> 19:05.332
A souvenir from childhood?

19:05.530 --> 19:08.089
My father sailed around
Cape Horn on a ship like that

19:08.289 --> 19:09.370
when he was a young man.

19:09.570 --> 19:12.250
This was his.

19:14.371 --> 19:15.212
Is he no longer with you?

19:15.412 --> 19:17.570
In a manner of speaking.

19:19.130 --> 19:21.770
My mother raised me on her own.

19:21.970 --> 19:25.252
In fact, I only just met
my father for the first time

19:25.450 --> 19:26.611
a few months ago.

19:26.811 --> 19:29.492
Sergeant, might we return
to the issue at hand?

19:29.692 --> 19:31.171
Yes, of course.

19:31.371 --> 19:32.971
Have you found something?

19:33.172 --> 19:33.972
On the contrary.

19:34.173 --> 19:36.209
There doesn't seem to be
a Pringle Creek anywhere

19:36.409 --> 19:37.731
on this map of British Columbia.

19:37.931 --> 19:40.973
Perhaps if I take a look.

19:43.772 --> 19:46.811
Does discussing personal matters
make you uncomfortable?

19:48.932 --> 19:50.012
No, it does not.

19:50.212 --> 19:52.331
You didn't glance to the left.

19:52.532 --> 19:54.252
No, I didn't.

19:56.132 --> 19:58.493
Well, then, I shall consider you

19:58.692 --> 20:01.529
a statistical anomaly, Detective.

20:02.411 --> 20:04.931
But it appears you are correct.

20:05.132 --> 20:06.373
It is nowhere on this map.

20:06.573 --> 20:10.331
Perhaps Pringle Creek
is like Germelshausen.

20:10.531 --> 20:13.252
The mythical town
from the Friedrich Gerstäcker novel

20:13.451 --> 20:15.732
that only appears
for one day every century.

20:15.932 --> 20:18.134
Gentlemen, while you've been discussing
fairy tales,

20:18.332 --> 20:19.852
I've managed to find
a real clue.

20:20.052 --> 20:21.932
I've just had confirmation
that Alexander Wilfritz

20:22.132 --> 20:22.933
is back in Canada

20:23.134 --> 20:25.374
after plying his trade in the States
these last few years.

20:25.574 --> 20:26.495
What trade would that be?

20:26.696 --> 20:27.891
Killer for hire.

20:28.091 --> 20:30.572
Goes by the name
of "Accidental Al."

20:30.772 --> 20:31.933
Because he's a bloody artist

20:32.134 --> 20:33.933
at making his murders
look like accidents.

20:34.133 --> 20:35.373
He's as dangerous as they come,

20:35.574 --> 20:37.132
and he's also
a master of disguise.

20:37.332 --> 20:38.132
Disguise, you say.

20:38.332 --> 20:39.293
Poses as a tradesman

20:39.492 --> 20:40.333
to get close to his victim.

20:40.534 --> 20:41.533
I don't care what you say.

20:41.733 --> 20:43.374
There are no rats here,
and I won't be tricked

20:43.574 --> 20:44.932
into paying for something
we don't need.

20:45.132 --> 20:46.374
Now, off with you!

20:52.214 --> 20:55.493
As I recall, his mustache
was thinner, his hair longer,

20:55.692 --> 20:57.334
and it was brown not black.

20:57.534 --> 21:00.295
I disagree.
I am certain of my observations.

21:01.574 --> 21:05.653
As I am equally certain of mine.

21:08.214 --> 21:11.614
- The rat catcher.
- The rat catcher.

21:11.815 --> 21:13.332
The rat catcher?

21:16.295 --> 21:17.935
Mr. Vanderlay.

21:19.695 --> 21:22.934
It appears we're too late.

21:26.735 --> 21:29.012
"The Collected Works
of William Topaz McGonagall."

21:29.213 --> 21:34.375
It seems our Mr. Vanderlay
had terrible taste in poetry.

21:39.334 --> 21:43.655
I suspect the cause of death
is nonpenetrating trauma.

21:43.855 --> 21:45.256
- Any signs of a struggle?
- No.

21:45.456 --> 21:47.814
But I'll know more
after the postmortem, of course.

21:48.015 --> 21:51.734
Oh, he was reading McGonagall?

21:51.935 --> 21:52.735
Oh, dear.

21:52.935 --> 21:54.736
I know.

21:54.935 --> 21:58.055
Those ridiculous verses
on railway bridges.

21:58.256 --> 21:59.414
What a dreadful way to die.

21:59.615 --> 22:02.737
Might I bring our attention
back to Mr. Vanderlay?

22:02.937 --> 22:05.135
Is there anything suggesting foul play?

22:05.335 --> 22:07.135
Well, it is highly unlikely

22:07.336 --> 22:09.855
that anyone
would voluntarily reach

22:10.056 --> 22:11.617
for a volume of McGonagall.

22:11.817 --> 22:12.894
Suggesting he was killed,

22:13.094 --> 22:14.774
then the book
was placed in his hand.

22:14.974 --> 22:17.255
I suspect that would be
difficult to prove

22:17.455 --> 22:18.375
in a court of law.

22:18.576 --> 22:23.455
But it does, once again,
suggest the work of Accidental Al.

22:25.616 --> 22:27.977
I don't care
what they call him back east.

22:28.177 --> 22:29.498
If that Al gets ahold of us,

22:29.697 --> 22:32.256
he ain't gonna bother
to make it look accidental.

22:33.616 --> 22:35.536
Right.

22:35.736 --> 22:38.338
That should be more than enough
aluminum filings.

22:38.537 --> 22:41.415
Now, you're sure
that there are explosives

22:41.615 --> 22:43.016
in that mining office?

22:43.216 --> 22:44.336
Sure as shootin'.

22:44.536 --> 22:46.297
My eyesight ain't that bad.

22:46.497 --> 22:47.417
Regardless,

22:47.617 --> 22:50.936
perhaps I should provide cover
this time.

22:51.135 --> 22:53.657
Ready?

23:31.058 --> 23:33.417
William!

23:40.059 --> 23:41.496
Okay.

23:52.178 --> 23:55.539
Oh, William!
Boy, are you alive?

23:58.817 --> 24:00.859
I believe I am.

24:01.058 --> 24:03.619
Boy, you gave me a fright!

24:03.819 --> 24:06.019
Where were you hit?

24:07.617 --> 24:09.578
Well, Byron and Shelley.

24:09.778 --> 24:13.659
Never underestimate the value
of a good book.

24:13.859 --> 24:15.861
Blasting caps.

24:16.061 --> 24:18.218
Blasting caps?

24:18.419 --> 24:20.139
Why not some dynamite?

24:20.340 --> 24:23.261
Blasting caps
contain potassium perchlorate.

24:23.460 --> 24:25.138
Oh, I hope you know
what you're talking about.

24:28.778 --> 24:30.339
Blasting caps.

24:30.539 --> 24:32.659
Ah, what luck!

24:32.860 --> 24:34.699
The bullet stopped
on the chapter

24:34.899 --> 24:37.139
dealing with values,
themes, and symbols.

24:37.339 --> 24:38.139
It's the best part,

24:38.340 --> 24:39.940
as I'm sure
Dr. Ogden would agree.

24:42.340 --> 24:44.940
I concur with you about Byron,
of course.

24:45.139 --> 24:47.300
Such stirring depth
and darkness.

24:47.499 --> 24:51.342
But I must tell you, Sergeant,
my heart belongs to Shelley.

24:51.539 --> 24:53.859
"Hail to thee, blithe Spirit!

24:54.059 --> 24:56.981
Bird thou never wert,
that from Heaven, or near it..."

24:57.180 --> 24:58.780
"Pourest thy full heart

24:58.980 --> 25:02.300
with profuse strains
of unpremeditated art."

25:04.140 --> 25:05.341
Oh, hello, Detective.

25:05.540 --> 25:06.701
Doctor,
have you information for me?

25:06.901 --> 25:07.702
Indeed, I do.

25:07.900 --> 25:10.219
It appears Sergeant Linney and I
share an affinity

25:10.420 --> 25:11.701
for the poets
of the Romantic era.

25:11.901 --> 25:14.542
What kind of poetry
do you prefer, Detective?

25:14.741 --> 25:18.498
I have a fondness for poets
from the post-Restoration period.

25:18.698 --> 25:19.939
Thank you.

25:20.140 --> 25:21.540
Now, might we discuss
the victim?

25:21.740 --> 25:22.541
Yes, of course.

25:22.741 --> 25:23.661
As I suspected,

25:23.861 --> 25:27.020
there's a nonpenetrating rupture
of the myocardium.

25:27.219 --> 25:28.660
So we know how he died.

25:28.860 --> 25:32.142
Yes, but there was something
I discovered earlier.

25:32.342 --> 25:34.061
Both his eardrums
were perforated.

25:34.262 --> 25:35.740
Tae Kwon what?

25:35.940 --> 25:37.822
Tae Kwon Do.

25:38.022 --> 25:39.741
And you can knock a man senseless
by using this?

25:39.942 --> 25:41.942
It's one of a number
of mysterious defensive techniques

25:42.142 --> 25:43.064
from the Far East.

25:43.263 --> 25:46.021
Sounds a bit dodgy to me.

25:46.221 --> 25:47.941
Ah, I myself have seen men
trained in the art

25:48.142 --> 25:49.222
render an opponent unconscious

25:49.421 --> 25:51.062
simply by simultaneously boxing
both ears.

25:51.262 --> 25:53.182
I suppose Accidental Al
is quite capable

25:53.381 --> 25:55.260
of picking up
a little trick like that.

25:55.460 --> 25:57.502
The effect may only last
for approximately 30 seconds,

25:57.703 --> 25:58.782
but that's more than enough time

25:58.982 --> 26:00.624
to place Mr. Vanderlay's body
in a position

26:00.821 --> 26:01.863
to drop the bookcase on him.

26:02.061 --> 26:04.301
So, our three victims,

26:04.501 --> 26:07.422
all connected by an ore sample

26:07.623 --> 26:11.982
and all killed
by a professional assassin.

26:12.181 --> 26:14.022
And you don't bring in
the likes of Accidental Al

26:14.222 --> 26:15.822
unless the stakes are very high.

26:16.021 --> 26:18.583
Arkona are running a swindle, gentlemen.

26:18.783 --> 26:19.741
I can smell it.

26:19.941 --> 26:22.823
- My...
- My suspicions exactly.

26:23.023 --> 26:24.502
The problem is proving it.

26:24.702 --> 26:28.783
Constable Crabtree, can you shed
some light on this matter?

26:28.983 --> 26:30.902
Indeed.

26:31.343 --> 26:33.424
May I?

26:35.023 --> 26:36.904
Gentlemen.

26:38.781 --> 26:42.102
If I may draw your attention
to the blackboard...

26:42.303 --> 26:43.343
Don't push it, bugalugs.

26:43.544 --> 26:44.543
Right.

26:44.744 --> 26:46.982
Actually, all I've been able
to ascertain is that Arkona Mines

26:47.182 --> 26:48.543
purchased
a sizable portion of land

26:48.744 --> 26:50.102
in the interior
of British Columbia.

26:50.302 --> 26:53.825
Land which encircles a small waterway
known as Pringle Creek.

26:54.025 --> 26:55.542
Explaining why
you couldn't find a town

26:55.742 --> 26:56.543
by that name.

26:56.744 --> 26:57.943
So, if there is a swindle,

26:58.143 --> 27:00.704
we have nothing concrete
tying Arkona Mines to it.

27:00.903 --> 27:02.345
What's worse
is we still can't prove

27:02.545 --> 27:04.021
that Fremont
commissioned the murders.

27:04.222 --> 27:05.583
And Accidental Al
is still on the loose.

27:05.783 --> 27:09.225
Gentlemen, our only concrete clue
is Pringle Creek

27:09.423 --> 27:11.424
and whatever is going on there.

27:11.624 --> 27:13.864
I shall depart immediately
and investigate myself.

27:14.064 --> 27:15.823
Sergeant, be careful.

27:16.023 --> 27:17.224
They've killed three times already.

27:17.424 --> 27:19.425
I will, Inspector.

27:19.626 --> 27:22.504
Would you like a drink
before you go?

27:22.704 --> 27:24.545
I'm afraid I don't indulge.

27:24.744 --> 27:29.585
Yes, well,
somehow I'm not surprised.

27:31.543 --> 27:33.143
Sir, there is one other thing.

27:33.344 --> 27:34.384
I have a list of everyone

27:34.585 --> 27:37.144
who's recently purchased
a land claim near Pringle Creek.

27:37.344 --> 27:40.024
No doubt having gotten wind
of Arkona's plan to invest there.

27:40.224 --> 27:42.545
No doubt planning to sell those claims
for a profit.

27:42.745 --> 27:43.944
My suspicions as well.

27:44.145 --> 27:46.185
Sir, there's one name
on the list

27:46.385 --> 27:49.144
that may be
of particular interest to you.

27:53.065 --> 27:55.146
Sir, I believe I should accompany
Sergeant Linney.

27:55.346 --> 27:57.664
It's his jurisdiction, Murdoch,
not yours.

27:57.863 --> 27:58.824
I understand that.

27:59.024 --> 28:00.985
But new information
has surfaced.

28:01.185 --> 28:02.305
And that's what?

28:02.506 --> 28:04.426
My father's name has turned up

28:04.627 --> 28:07.345
on a list of Pringle Creek
land claims.

28:07.544 --> 28:08.945
And you think the old boy's
in trouble?

28:09.146 --> 28:10.145
Possibly.

28:10.346 --> 28:12.185
Or worse,
he's involved in the swindle.

28:16.146 --> 28:17.665
Get on the next train
with Linney.

28:17.865 --> 28:20.267
But remember, this isn't just about
your father, Murdoch.

28:20.467 --> 28:21.667
There are murders to solve.

28:21.867 --> 28:23.224
Thank you, sir.
I will.

28:23.424 --> 28:25.186
Oh, and what about Mr. Fremont?

28:25.385 --> 28:26.985
You leave Fremont to me.

28:35.987 --> 28:38.426
Dr. Ogden?

29:02.786 --> 29:03.867
It's been a pleasure, Constable.

29:04.067 --> 29:05.828
Sir.

29:06.468 --> 29:08.066
Constable, been a pleasure.

29:08.266 --> 29:11.027
George, I need you to look
into something for me

29:11.228 --> 29:12.068
while I'm gone.

29:12.267 --> 29:13.108
Of course, sir.

29:13.308 --> 29:15.428
I need you to find out
whatever you can

29:15.629 --> 29:17.147
about a Mr. Reginald Poundsett.

29:17.346 --> 29:20.227
Oh, a personal request,
huh, sir?

29:21.947 --> 29:22.748
You're right, George.

29:22.948 --> 29:24.228
I'm sorry.
I never should have asked.

29:24.429 --> 29:26.107
Oh, no, sir, don't give it
a second thought.

29:26.306 --> 29:28.707
In fact, if you'd like,
I could have some of the lads

29:28.908 --> 29:31.629
suggest to him there's more than one way
to visit the morgue.

29:31.829 --> 29:33.548
Oh, that won't be necessary.

29:33.747 --> 29:36.908
A simple inquiry into his background
will suffice.

29:37.108 --> 29:40.350
All I'm saying, sir,
is he needn't stay that pretty.

30:00.868 --> 30:02.348
Whoa.

30:06.349 --> 30:08.311
Appears to be deserted.

30:08.511 --> 30:10.827
Doesn't look like anyone's lived here
for quite some time.

30:15.788 --> 30:18.548
There's no way the ore sample
Uriah Doakes tested

30:18.748 --> 30:19.868
came from this mine.

30:20.069 --> 30:21.989
Agreed.

30:23.750 --> 30:26.909
So, Arkona Mines buys up land,
dirt cheap no doubt,

30:27.108 --> 30:28.911
and suddenly, they're testing
ore samples for gold.

30:29.109 --> 30:30.349
And should they
suddenly find it...

30:30.549 --> 30:31.631
The land's value
would skyrocket.

30:31.829 --> 30:32.630
Investors buy in.

30:32.830 --> 30:35.110
But, as we know, there is
no gold in Pringle Creek.

30:35.311 --> 30:37.109
Eventually,
investors get the bad news

30:37.309 --> 30:38.949
that the mine's vein
has dried up.

30:39.149 --> 30:40.270
Everyone loses but Arkona.

30:40.469 --> 30:43.951
So, that is how
the swindle works.

30:44.148 --> 30:45.549
One question remains.

30:45.749 --> 30:47.028
How do we prove it?

30:59.872 --> 31:02.309
Make one move and I'll whack ya!

31:02.510 --> 31:04.069
- Dad!
- Dad!

31:05.429 --> 31:07.350
William?

31:07.550 --> 31:10.350
Jasper?

31:10.551 --> 31:11.989
Did you just...

31:12.190 --> 31:14.031
Call him dad, yes, I did.

31:14.231 --> 31:17.352
I definitely could use a drink.

31:23.311 --> 31:25.831
I have been waiting here
for one hour, Inspector.

31:26.031 --> 31:27.792
And I do appreciate that,
Mr. Fremont.

31:27.993 --> 31:30.190
Your patience is commendable.

31:30.390 --> 31:31.950
Why am I still here?

31:32.149 --> 31:33.872
I've already told your Detective Murdoch
everything I know.

31:34.071 --> 31:38.390
You're here because I've seen
quite a few mining scams.

31:38.590 --> 31:40.990
Innocent people losing
their life savings.

31:41.190 --> 31:43.271
And I don't like it
one little bit.

31:43.471 --> 31:45.434
Arkona is a reputable company.

31:45.633 --> 31:47.150
We have holdings
on three continents.

31:47.351 --> 31:49.831
I'm only interested
in one holding.

31:50.032 --> 31:51.152
Pringle Creek.

31:53.353 --> 31:54.593
What of it?

31:59.071 --> 32:00.752
I think you've got a con
going on.

32:00.951 --> 32:02.753
Big gold find
mysteriously goes dry.

32:02.953 --> 32:04.151
Investors lose everything.

32:04.351 --> 32:05.713
And to keep matters secret,

32:05.912 --> 32:08.352
you kill the three men
that could expose you.

32:08.553 --> 32:09.953
- That's absurd.
- Is it?

32:10.152 --> 32:11.952
For your information,
Arkona have determined

32:12.152 --> 32:13.352
that the Pringle Creek operation

32:13.552 --> 32:14.992
has no chance
of being profitable.

32:15.192 --> 32:15.993
Have they, now?

32:16.193 --> 32:17.912
Furthermore,
we have curtailed all attempts

32:18.112 --> 32:18.953
to acquire investors.

32:19.154 --> 32:21.790
Whatever losses were incurred
will be refunded,

32:21.991 --> 32:24.992
so, you see, Inspector,
there are no victims here.

32:25.553 --> 32:28.594
Simply three tragic accidents.

32:30.833 --> 32:32.472
Am I free to go?

32:45.514 --> 32:48.272
Thank you.

32:48.991 --> 32:50.633
So, Fremont just walks away?

32:50.834 --> 32:52.353
All part of a larger plan.

32:52.552 --> 32:53.633
A plan, sir?

32:53.834 --> 32:55.674
Crabtree, Murdoch isn't the only one
around here

32:55.874 --> 32:57.273
who can think like Murdoch, eh?

32:57.472 --> 32:59.153
If you say so, sir.

33:00.472 --> 33:03.474
This father you met
just a few months ago, was it...

33:03.673 --> 33:05.116
Yes.

33:05.313 --> 33:07.954
And what name did he give you?

33:08.154 --> 33:10.394
Harry Smith.

33:10.595 --> 33:13.195
Smith, eh?
How original.

33:13.395 --> 33:15.312
I understand how you might --

33:15.513 --> 33:18.152
you might have a few questions for me.

33:18.353 --> 33:19.554
Now, if you give me
a moment here,

33:19.754 --> 33:21.956
I'll do my best to come up
with an explanation.

33:22.155 --> 33:22.953
Aha!

33:23.152 --> 33:24.834
Ow! Oh! Oh!

33:25.034 --> 33:26.915
Whoa! Jesus!

33:29.354 --> 33:31.475
I believe an explanation
is in order,

33:31.673 --> 33:33.714
but now might not be
the best time.

33:33.914 --> 33:35.155
Why are they shooting at me?

33:35.354 --> 33:36.476
It's got to be your fault.

33:36.674 --> 33:38.355
My fault?

33:38.555 --> 33:39.595
If it wasn't for you,

33:39.796 --> 33:42.874
I never would have considered
coming out here for one moment.

33:43.074 --> 33:45.954
Whatever you're doing, boys,
be quick about it.

33:46.154 --> 33:49.713
The sun sets,
they'll make their move.

33:49.914 --> 33:51.954
That's precisely
what we're counting on.

33:53.556 --> 33:54.634
Ah, perfect.

33:56.036 --> 33:58.474
As policemen,
I believe the marshal's office

33:58.675 --> 34:00.714
is a perfect place
for a last stand.

34:00.915 --> 34:04.235
If we make it there alive.

34:11.275 --> 34:12.275
Go! Go!

34:19.554 --> 34:21.476
Let's go.

34:22.116 --> 34:25.034
Aah!

34:28.597 --> 34:29.956
Think they bought it?

34:30.156 --> 34:32.558
We'll soon find out.

34:35.835 --> 34:36.795
This will work.

34:36.996 --> 34:38.357
Work?
What are you talking about?

34:38.556 --> 34:39.636
We're about to even the odds.

34:39.835 --> 34:40.636
How?

34:40.837 --> 34:42.795
By letting them
make the first move.

34:42.995 --> 34:45.275
While we wait,
perhaps there's a little something

34:45.476 --> 34:46.877
you'd like to explain to us.

34:48.478 --> 34:51.956
Yes, yes, I been looking forward

34:52.156 --> 34:56.837
to having a little talk
with you boys.

34:59.876 --> 35:03.597
In my younger days,
I was a bit of the seaman.

35:03.797 --> 35:04.716
I sailed...

35:04.917 --> 35:06.157
Sailed around Cape Horn.

35:06.357 --> 35:08.078
Yes, we know.
Please continue.

35:08.279 --> 35:11.556
Five times.
Shipwrecked seven.

35:11.756 --> 35:15.718
By then, I'd had my fill
of the seafaring life.

35:15.917 --> 35:17.756
I put in at Vancouver.

35:17.957 --> 35:19.238
Wonderful town.

35:19.437 --> 35:22.078
I thought, "it's a good town
to make a fresh start."

35:22.277 --> 35:24.679
So I changed my name.

35:24.878 --> 35:26.556
To Harry Smith.

35:26.756 --> 35:27.756
Right.

35:27.956 --> 35:32.358
And then I met Jasper's mother,
Lucinda Linney.

35:32.558 --> 35:33.759
Remarkable woman.

35:33.958 --> 35:38.677
Lucinda was an unusual woman
with unusual ideas.

35:38.877 --> 35:42.639
She had no regard
for the legal bond.

35:42.839 --> 35:45.758
Making it that much easier
for you to abandon them.

35:45.958 --> 35:47.918
I didn't abandon her.

35:48.119 --> 35:49.998
No, she abandoned me.

35:50.199 --> 35:54.357
I didn't know
that she was with child.

35:54.557 --> 35:56.758
I had no idea
that Jasper existed

35:56.959 --> 35:58.999
until he was a grown man.

35:59.199 --> 36:00.359
Is this true?

36:00.559 --> 36:01.597
It is.

36:01.797 --> 36:03.157
So, William,

36:03.358 --> 36:08.359
once you and I reached
our little understanding,

36:08.559 --> 36:12.438
I thought, "I've got to take myself
to Vancouver

36:12.638 --> 36:15.200
and make things right
with Jasper."

36:15.399 --> 36:18.760
Then I thought,
"I've got to make some money

36:18.960 --> 36:22.679
so that I can feel worthy
of being his father."

36:24.559 --> 36:26.999
You don't honestly expect me to believe
that last part, do you?

36:29.918 --> 36:31.919
You were right
about the looking left.

36:32.119 --> 36:33.520
I told you.

36:33.720 --> 36:36.041
Inspector, I shall not tolerate
another interrogation.

36:36.241 --> 36:38.599
All further questions should be directed
to my counsel.

36:38.798 --> 36:42.041
Mr. Fremont,
three people have been murdered.

36:42.240 --> 36:44.001
Two of them
were in my jurisdiction.

36:44.200 --> 36:46.599
I'm here to make sure
there's not going to be another.

36:46.798 --> 36:48.079
What are you talking about?

36:48.279 --> 36:50.400
Well, it would be
a dereliction of my duty

36:50.600 --> 36:51.600
if I didn't warn you.

36:51.801 --> 36:53.441
Warn me?
Of what?

36:53.640 --> 36:55.800
Not what.
Who.

36:55.999 --> 36:57.400
Accidental Al.

36:57.599 --> 37:00.560
When he finds out
the police are onto him,

37:00.760 --> 37:02.362
he's gonna do
what he always does.

37:02.561 --> 37:04.560
Clean up any loose ends.

37:04.760 --> 37:07.001
You didn't know that, did ya?

37:07.200 --> 37:08.161
It's Al's trademark.

37:08.360 --> 37:10.762
The only person
who can point the finger at him

37:10.962 --> 37:12.279
is the bloke who hired him.

37:12.479 --> 37:14.560
And we both know
who's next in line

37:14.759 --> 37:17.161
to have a little accident,
don't we?

37:19.001 --> 37:21.039
I've heard quite enough, Inspector.

37:21.240 --> 37:22.681
Yes, I'm sure you have.

37:35.802 --> 37:37.361
He picked up the phone
as soon as you left.

37:37.562 --> 37:39.160
I'll bet he did.

37:39.360 --> 37:41.281
It's me, Fremont.

37:41.480 --> 37:43.641
I have a problem
that we need to take care of.

37:43.840 --> 37:45.521
Can't Wilfritz handle it?

37:45.722 --> 37:47.122
No, he can't handle the problem.

37:47.321 --> 37:49.080
He is the problem.

37:49.280 --> 37:50.362
Got him.

37:52.001 --> 37:54.361
While you're still
in a truthful mood, Harry.

37:54.561 --> 37:56.762
Perhaps you can tell us
why you're really here.

37:56.962 --> 37:58.682
I told you.
Uriah Doakes.

37:58.882 --> 38:01.522
He gave me a hot tip
on Pringle Creek.

38:01.723 --> 38:04.563
But something was wrong?

38:04.764 --> 38:05.561
He came to see me,

38:05.759 --> 38:07.762
and he told me
there was something fishy

38:07.962 --> 38:09.641
about the Pringle Creek
land deal.

38:09.842 --> 38:11.882
He told me about
a Toronto mining company

38:12.082 --> 38:13.963
that wasn't on the up-and-up.

38:14.159 --> 38:16.202
He said he was going to the police
about the matter.

38:16.402 --> 38:19.004
So you gave him my card.

38:19.202 --> 38:20.082
I did.

38:20.282 --> 38:23.321
And then, Uriah's dead.

38:23.522 --> 38:26.202
Broke my heart.

38:26.402 --> 38:29.403
He was a good man, Uriah.

38:29.603 --> 38:33.443
I felt I owed it to him
to look into the matter.

38:33.643 --> 38:37.242
And that's how I ended up here.

38:42.283 --> 38:43.563
How many of these have you got?

38:43.763 --> 38:45.522
You know what to do.

38:45.722 --> 38:48.563
Oh, this is too clean.
They'll never believe it.

38:49.203 --> 38:52.123
Son, know your audience.

38:53.164 --> 38:54.644
You out there!

38:54.845 --> 38:56.445
My sons are dying in here.

38:56.644 --> 38:58.282
Please!

38:58.482 --> 39:01.323
Just let me bury them in peace!

39:05.084 --> 39:08.003
Sun goes down,
they'll shoot this place full of holes.

39:11.082 --> 39:14.164
Let's hope this works.

39:34.444 --> 39:35.964
Aah! Aah!

39:37.484 --> 39:40.925
- I can't see!
- I'm blind!

39:41.125 --> 39:42.284
I can't hear anything!

39:42.483 --> 39:44.405
Right this way, gentlemen.

39:44.606 --> 39:48.046
Easy does it!
There we go!

39:56.764 --> 39:58.245
So, you call that a grenade?

39:58.446 --> 40:00.484
Derived from
the word "pomegranate,"

40:00.684 --> 40:01.764
because of the shape.

40:01.964 --> 40:05.365
Based on the Byzantine concept
dating back to the 8th century.

40:05.566 --> 40:07.646
Of course, ours looked nothing
like a pomegranate.

40:07.846 --> 40:10.406
Nor did it explode violently.
Rather, it was intended to stun.

40:10.605 --> 40:11.645
The idea deriving from

40:11.845 --> 40:13.766
a Tae Kwon Do-like
martial-arts blow.

40:13.966 --> 40:15.767
Which disrupts
the inner ear's...

40:15.967 --> 40:17.924
Now, boys, boys,
I'm not a scientist.

40:18.124 --> 40:19.365
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

40:19.564 --> 40:25.167
Fellas, this has been
one hell of a family reunion.

40:25.924 --> 40:27.045
That it has.

40:27.244 --> 40:29.245
Indeed.

40:43.765 --> 40:45.646
So, what will you do now?

40:45.845 --> 40:48.565
Oh, I thought
I'd stay on awhile.

40:48.766 --> 40:51.808
Help young Jasper
put his life in order.

40:52.008 --> 40:53.686
Sounds like a fine idea.

40:53.885 --> 40:54.886
Gentlemen.

40:55.087 --> 40:57.646
If he gives you any trouble, arrest him.

40:57.847 --> 40:59.767
It's worked well in the past.

41:01.089 --> 41:02.565
Well...

41:02.766 --> 41:05.007
Yeah.

41:05.207 --> 41:07.808
Good.

41:08.727 --> 41:12.647
I suppose there is much
that we could talk about.

41:12.845 --> 41:15.487
I suppose.

41:15.687 --> 41:18.008
Would you rather we didn't?

41:18.207 --> 41:21.247
Another fine idea.

41:23.207 --> 41:27.369
There is one bit of brotherly advice
that cannot wait.

41:28.447 --> 41:29.327
Very well.

41:29.527 --> 41:31.928
Dr. Ogden.

41:32.129 --> 41:34.048
Any woman that can recite
"To a Skylark"

41:34.248 --> 41:35.689
while cutting open a human heart

41:35.889 --> 41:38.366
is a rare woman indeed.

41:38.567 --> 41:39.967
Make it right, William.

42:08.409 --> 42:10.609
It seems there's a bit
of a jurisdictional battle

42:10.809 --> 42:13.569
going on over who puts the noose
around Accidental Al's neck,

42:13.768 --> 42:15.248
although we do have Fremont
to ourselves.

42:15.448 --> 42:16.969
- Oh, that's good news, indeed.
- Yes, it is.

42:17.169 --> 42:20.169
Oh, and there's one other thing.
Crabtree!

42:21.929 --> 42:23.170
Welcome back, sir.

42:23.369 --> 42:25.409
Thank you, George.

42:25.610 --> 42:27.651
Well, tell him.

42:27.851 --> 42:30.528
Sir, I have the information
you requested on Mr. Poundsett.

42:30.727 --> 42:31.529
Ah, yes, George.

42:31.729 --> 42:34.169
I must apologize to you again
for asking you to do that.

42:34.370 --> 42:35.929
I don't know
what I was thinking.

42:36.130 --> 42:36.970
Bollocks.

42:37.170 --> 42:38.930
It's plain as day to everyone
that you've been pining.

42:39.129 --> 42:40.528
Pining?

42:40.728 --> 42:43.010
Definitely pining, sir.

42:43.209 --> 42:46.570
However, moving on,
I think you'll find the results

42:46.770 --> 42:49.450
of my investigation
very interesting.

43:09.611 --> 43:11.931
I still can't believe
I'm about to do this.

43:12.131 --> 43:13.689
You'll never have a finer day.

43:13.890 --> 43:16.250
Now, are you sure you're ready?

43:16.450 --> 43:18.731
Absolutely.

43:20.531 --> 43:22.769
- Julia!
- Prepare the balloon.

43:22.968 --> 43:25.371
William.
What are you doing here?

43:25.570 --> 43:26.490
I came to see you.

43:26.690 --> 43:29.211
How did you find me?

43:29.412 --> 43:30.971
I've had time to think
about matters,

43:31.170 --> 43:32.370
and I must speak with you, now.

43:32.570 --> 43:34.851
Julia.

43:35.051 --> 43:38.091
William, I have
a rather pressing engagement.

43:38.292 --> 43:40.810
Yes, but...

43:41.010 --> 43:42.690
Julia.

43:42.890 --> 43:44.091
Julia, it can't wait!

43:44.292 --> 43:45.372
Is something wrong?

43:45.572 --> 43:46.932
Yes.

43:47.132 --> 43:49.210
No, nothing is wrong.

43:49.410 --> 43:50.611
But nothing is right, either.

43:50.810 --> 43:52.491
It hasn't been
since our falling out.

43:52.691 --> 43:54.811
I see.

43:55.012 --> 43:58.130
Do you think it's possible
for us to start again?

43:58.331 --> 44:01.171
I'm not sure.

44:01.371 --> 44:03.492
Are you willing
to talk about it?

44:06.931 --> 44:09.332
Are you willing to see
which way the wind takes us?

44:11.132 --> 44:12.173
That could be anywhere.

44:12.372 --> 44:14.453
Yes, William, it could.

44:32.892 --> 44:35.413
Doctor, are you familiar
with the details

44:35.613 --> 44:38.374
of the first recorded flight
of a hot-air balloon?

44:39.733 --> 44:42.570
Pilâtre de Rozier
from the center of Paris

44:42.771 --> 44:44.413
on November 21, 1783.

44:44.613 --> 44:46.734
Ah. That was
the first manned flight.

44:46.933 --> 44:48.452
Joseph and Étienne Montgolfier

44:48.653 --> 44:50.732
launched one
two months before that.

44:50.931 --> 44:54.573
The passengers were a duck,
a sheep, and a rooster.

44:56.073 --> 44:57.574
How fascinating!
