00:03.800 --> 00:05.040
Why today?

00:09.520 --> 00:14.599
Do you want to hear me say it?
18 months since our last appointment.

00:14.600 --> 00:15.880
You read the papers?

00:17.360 --> 00:19.920
Sometimes... And you watch telly?

00:22.200 --> 00:23.640
You know why I'm here.

00:27.560 --> 00:28.920
I'm here because...

00:33.600 --> 00:35.400
What happened, John?

00:47.640 --> 00:49.080
Sherl...

00:53.360 --> 00:54.840
You need to get it out.

00:57.240 --> 01:00.760
My best friend... Sherlock Holmes...

01:03.080 --> 01:04.519
..is dead.

01:09.000 --> 01:14.000
Sherlock 2x03
"The Reichenbach Fall"

01:15.000 --> 01:20.000
Subtitles by Red Bee Media Ltd

01:37.920 --> 01:42.079
Falls Of The Reichenbach.
Turner's masterpiece.

01:42.080 --> 01:43.839
Thankfully recovered,

01:43.840 --> 01:47.800
owing to the prodigious talent
of Mr Sherlock Holmes.

01:51.320 --> 01:53.240
A small token of our gratitude.

01:54.360 --> 01:57.639
Diamond cufflinks...
All my cuffs have buttons.

01:57.640 --> 01:58.960
He means thank you. Do I?

01:58.961 --> 02:01.799
Just say it. Thank you.

02:01.800 --> 02:03.240
Hang on.

02:07.760 --> 02:13.599
Back together with my family,
after my terrifying ordeal.

02:13.600 --> 02:17.879
And we have one person to thank
for my deliverance...

02:17.880 --> 02:20.040
Sherlock Holmes.

02:23.720 --> 02:26.280
Tie pin. I don't wear ties. Shhh.

02:29.440 --> 02:34.399
Peter Ricoletti... Number one on
Interpol's most wanted list since 1982.

02:34.400 --> 02:36.580
We got him, and there's one person we have

02:36.581 --> 02:38.759
to thank for giving us the decisive leads.

02:38.760 --> 02:41.399
With all his customary diplomacy and tact.

02:41.400 --> 02:44.000
Sarcasm. Yes.

02:45.160 --> 02:46.560
We all chipped in.

02:52.280 --> 02:55.519
Oh... Put the hat on. Put the hat on.

02:55.520 --> 02:57.799
Yes, Sherlock, put it on.

02:57.800 --> 03:00.160
Just get it over with.

03:10.800 --> 03:12.999
"Boffin!"

03:13.000 --> 03:15.559
"Boffin Sherlock Holmes!"

03:15.560 --> 03:16.838
Everybody gets one.

03:16.839 --> 03:18.320
One what? Tabloid nickname.

03:18.321 --> 03:20.740
SuBo, Nasty Nick.
I'll probably get one soon.

03:20.741 --> 03:23.159
Page five, column six, first sentence.

03:23.160 --> 03:26.199
Why is it always the hat photograph?!

03:26.200 --> 03:28.040
"Bachelor John Watson.
" What kind of hat is it?

03:28.041 --> 03:29.879
What are they implying?!

03:29.880 --> 03:32.879
Is it a cap? Why has it
got two fronts? It's a deerstalker.

03:32.880 --> 03:35.200
"Frequently seen in the company
of bachelor John Watson.

03:35.201 --> 03:37.519
" What are you going to do, throw it?

03:37.520 --> 03:41.199
"Confirmed bachelor John Watson."
A death frisbee! This is too much,

03:41.200 --> 03:43.580
we need to be more careful. It's got flaps.

03:43.581 --> 03:45.959
Ear flaps, it's an ear hat, John.

03:45.960 --> 03:47.759
What do you mean, more careful?

03:47.760 --> 03:50.999
I mean, this isn't a deerstalker
now, it's a Sherlock Holmes hat.

03:51.000 --> 03:53.839
I mean, you're not exactly
a private detective any more.

03:53.840 --> 03:56.039
You're this far from famous.
Oh, it'll pass.

03:56.040 --> 03:59.740
It better pass.
The press will turn, Sherlock,

03:59.741 --> 04:03.439
they always turn and they'll turn on you.

04:03.440 --> 04:06.239
It really bothers you.
What? What people say. Yes.

04:06.240 --> 04:08.360
About me? why would it upset YOU?

04:10.520 --> 04:14.640
Just try to keep a low profile. Find
yourself a little case this week.

04:15.920 --> 04:17.880
Stay out of the news.

04:58.240 --> 04:59.959
That's your phone.

04:59.960 --> 05:02.200
Hmm, it keeps doing that.

05:05.080 --> 05:10.679
So, did you just talk to him
for a really long time?

05:10.680 --> 05:13.799
Oh, Henry Fishguard
never committed suicide.

05:13.800 --> 05:16.279
Bow Street runners missed everything.

05:16.280 --> 05:20.799
Pressing case, is it? They're all
pressing until they're solved.

05:20.800 --> 05:23.800
Put your key back please.
Thank you.

05:26.760 --> 05:29.279
Excuse me, sir.

05:29.280 --> 05:32.040
Any metal objects, keys, mobile phones?

05:34.200 --> 05:35.879
You can go through.

05:35.880 --> 05:37.080
Thank you.

06:08.040 --> 06:09.520
Fancy a cuppa then, mate?

06:09.521 --> 06:11.000
Yeah, why not?

06:13.240 --> 06:15.039
Gilts at seven.

06:15.040 --> 06:18.960
Dutch Telecoms in free-fall.
Thank you, Harvey.

06:23.000 --> 06:24.120
What are you saying?

06:24.121 --> 06:27.999
Refuse them all parole
and bring back the rope?

06:28.000 --> 06:29.600
Let's begin.

06:48.320 --> 06:50.839
This is an emergency. Please leave.

06:50.840 --> 06:54.400
Sir, I'm going to have to ask you to leave.

07:07.560 --> 07:09.199
Sir, there's been a break-in.

07:09.200 --> 07:10.240
Not our division.

07:10.241 --> 07:11.680
You'll want it.

07:22.160 --> 07:24.440
The vault!

07:30.800 --> 07:35.159
Hacked into the Tower of bloody
London's security?! How?!

07:35.160 --> 07:36.980
Tell them we're on our way!

07:36.981 --> 07:38.799
There's been another one, another break-in.

07:38.800 --> 07:40.280
Bank of England!

08:00.240 --> 08:03.320
Sir! Security's down, sir.
It's failing.

08:04.640 --> 08:05.840
What is it now?

08:05.841 --> 08:07.599
Pentonville Prison.

08:07.600 --> 08:10.320
Oh no!

09:20.240 --> 09:22.320
No rush.

09:26.200 --> 09:27.720
I'll get it, shall I?

09:36.200 --> 09:38.879
Here. Not now, I'm busy.

09:38.880 --> 09:41.720
Sherlock... Not now! He's back.

09:57.280 --> 09:59.679
That glass is tougher than anything.

09:59.680 --> 10:03.480
Not tougher than crystallised
carbon. He used a diamond.

10:24.240 --> 10:28.199
# Oh, sinnerman, where you gonna run to?

10:28.200 --> 10:31.160
# Sinnerman, where you gonna run to?

10:32.480 --> 10:35.159
# Where you gonna run to?

10:35.160 --> 10:37.439
# All on that day

10:37.440 --> 10:40.519
# Well, I run to the rock... #

10:40.520 --> 10:42.520
Ready? Yes.

10:44.760 --> 10:47.199
Stand back. Stand back.
Mr Holmes. Mr Holmes.

10:47.200 --> 10:50.560
Let them through.
Thank you. Get in.

10:52.280 --> 10:56.760
# Oh, Lord... # Please help me, Lord

10:57.760 --> 11:00.400
# Don't you see me praying

11:01.440 --> 11:04.959
# Don't you see me down here praying

11:04.960 --> 11:07.039
# But the Lord said

11:07.040 --> 11:10.759
# Go to the devil The Lord said

11:10.760 --> 11:13.240
# Go to the devil

11:14.520 --> 11:17.079
# He said Go to the devil

11:17.080 --> 11:18.599
# All on that day

11:18.600 --> 11:20.999
# So I ran to the devil

11:21.000 --> 11:23.919
# He was waiting... #

11:23.920 --> 11:25.480
Remember... Yes.

11:27.000 --> 11:28.360
Remember... Yes.

11:29.600 --> 11:33.119
Remember what they told you.
Don't try to be clever. No.

11:33.120 --> 11:35.580
Please, keep it simple and brief.
God forbid the

11:35.581 --> 11:38.039
star witness at the trial
should appear intelligent.

11:38.040 --> 11:41.439
Intelligent, fine. Let's give
"smart-arse" a wide berth.

11:41.440 --> 11:44.640
I'll just be myself.
Are you listening to me?

11:52.800 --> 11:54.759
Today, outside the Old Bailey...

11:54.760 --> 11:58.159
This is the trial of the century...
The trial of James Moriarty...

11:58.160 --> 12:00.519
James Moriarty, earlier today accused of...

12:00.520 --> 12:02.519
..attempting to steal
the Crown Jewels.

12:02.520 --> 12:05.760
At the Old Bailey we have
Reichenbach hero Sherlock Holmes...

12:15.120 --> 12:18.040
Would you mind slipping your hand
into my pocket?

12:35.600 --> 12:37.279
Thanks.

12:37.280 --> 12:40.319
# It was boiling, I ran to the sea

12:40.320 --> 12:43.679
# It was boiling
I ran to the sea... #

12:43.680 --> 12:48.240
Crown v Moriarty,
please proceed to Court 10.

12:49.640 --> 12:50.920
You're him.

12:53.320 --> 12:56.559
Wrong toilet. I'm a big fan.
Evidently.

12:56.560 --> 12:59.679
I read your cases, follow them all.

12:59.680 --> 13:02.600
Sign my shirt, would you?

13:04.280 --> 13:06.400
There are two types of fans. Oh?

13:07.480 --> 13:10.359
Catch me before I kill again,
Type A. Uh-huh.

13:10.360 --> 13:14.919
What's Type B? Your bedroom's
just a taxi ride away. Hmm.

13:14.920 --> 13:16.280
Guess which one I am?

13:19.680 --> 13:22.279
Neither. Really?
No, you're not a fan at all.

13:22.280 --> 13:25.599
Those marks on your forearm,
edge of a desk.

13:25.600 --> 13:29.479
You've been typing in a hurry, probably,
pressure on, facing a deadline.

13:29.480 --> 13:30.999
That all?

13:31.000 --> 13:34.239
There's an ink smudge on your wrist,
a bulge in your jacket pocket.

13:34.240 --> 13:36.380
Bit of a giveaway? The smudge is deliberate,

13:36.381 --> 13:38.519
to see if I'm as good as they say I am.

13:38.520 --> 13:41.799
Hmm. Oil-based,
used in newspaper print.

13:41.800 --> 13:45.719
But drawn on with an index finger,
your finger. Hmm.

13:45.720 --> 13:49.640
Journalist. Unlikely you
get your hands dirty at the press.

13:50.960 --> 13:54.079
You put that there to test me.
Wow! I'm liking you.

13:54.080 --> 13:57.599
I'd make a great feature, "Sherlock
Holmes, the man beneath the hat".

13:57.600 --> 14:01.719
Kitty... Riley. Pleased to meet you.

14:01.720 --> 14:04.160
I'm saving you the job of asking.

14:04.161 --> 14:06.599
I won't give you an interview.
No, I don't want the money.

14:06.600 --> 14:08.800
You and John Watson, just platonic?

14:08.801 --> 14:10.999
Can I put you down for
a "no" there as well

14:11.000 --> 14:16.319
There's all sorts of gossip
in the press about you.

14:16.320 --> 14:20.159
Sooner or later, you're going
to need someone on your side.

14:20.160 --> 14:23.440
Someone to set the record straight.

14:25.160 --> 14:27.399
You think you're
the girl for that job, do you?

14:27.400 --> 14:30.400
I'm smart and you can trust me...

14:31.440 --> 14:32.959
..totally.

14:32.960 --> 14:36.679
Smart? OK, investigative
journalist.

14:36.680 --> 14:39.800
Good. Well, look at me
and tell me what you see.

14:41.960 --> 14:45.279
If you're that skilful,
you don't need an interview,

14:45.280 --> 14:47.440
you can just read what you need.

14:49.200 --> 14:51.879
No? OK, my turn.

14:51.880 --> 14:54.040
I see someone who's waiting for their first

14:54.041 --> 14:56.199
scoop, so their editor will notice them.

14:56.200 --> 14:58.860
You're wearing an expensive
skirt, that's been

14:58.861 --> 15:01.519
rehemmed twice. Only posh skirt you've got.

15:01.520 --> 15:03.440
Your nails, you can't afford
to do them that often.

15:03.441 --> 15:05.359
I see someone who's hungry,

15:05.360 --> 15:07.820
I don't see smart. I don't see trustworthy.

15:07.821 --> 15:10.280
I'll give you a quote.
if you like. Three little words.

15:12.040 --> 15:15.360
You repel me.

15:28.440 --> 15:31.519
"A consulting criminal." Yes.

15:31.520 --> 15:34.960
Your words.
Can you expand on that answer?

15:36.120 --> 15:39.439
James Moriarty is for hire.
A tradesman?

15:39.440 --> 15:42.639
Yes. But not the sort
who'd fix your heating?

15:42.640 --> 15:45.679
No, the sort who'd plant a bomb
or stage an assassination.

15:45.680 --> 15:48.239
But I'm sure he'd make a decent job
of your boiler.

15:48.240 --> 15:49.799
Would you describe him as...

15:49.800 --> 15:52.279
Leading. What?
You're leading the witness.

15:52.280 --> 15:54.759
He'll object and the judge'll
uphold. Mr Holmes.

15:54.760 --> 15:56.560
Ask me how, HOW would I describe him?

15:56.561 --> 16:00.319
What opinion have I formed of him?
Do they not teach you this?

16:00.320 --> 16:02.519
Mr Holmes, we are fine without your help.

16:02.520 --> 16:06.479
HOW would you describe this man,
his character?

16:06.480 --> 16:07.959
First mistake.

16:07.960 --> 16:10.799
James Moriarty isn't a man at all.

16:10.800 --> 16:12.480
He's a spider.

16:13.840 --> 16:17.439
A spider at the centre of a web, a
criminal web with a thousand threads

16:17.440 --> 16:21.440
and he knows precisely how each
and every single one of them dances.

16:25.040 --> 16:27.359
And how long...?
No, no. Don't, don't do that.

16:27.360 --> 16:30.079
That's really not a good question.
Mr Holmes!

16:30.080 --> 16:32.879
How long have I known him?
Not your best line of enquiry.

16:32.880 --> 16:35.119
We met twice, five minutes in total.

16:35.120 --> 16:37.439
I pulled a gun, he tried to blow me up.

16:37.440 --> 16:39.599
I felt we had a special something.

16:39.600 --> 16:44.039
Miss Sorrel, are you seriously
claiming this man is an expert?

16:44.040 --> 16:47.079
After knowing the accused
for just five minutes?

16:47.080 --> 16:50.119
Two minutes would have made me
an expert, five was ample.

16:50.120 --> 16:53.280
Mr Holmes, that's a matter
for the jury. Oh, really?

16:56.720 --> 16:58.439
One librarian, two teachers,

16:58.440 --> 17:00.719
two high-pressure jobs,
probably the City.

17:00.720 --> 17:03.060
The foreman's a medical secretary, trained

17:03.061 --> 17:05.398
abroad, judging by her shorthand. Mr Holmes?

17:05.400 --> 17:08.519
Seven are married, two are having
an affair with each other.

17:08.520 --> 17:10.740
Oh, they've just had tea and biscuits.

17:10.741 --> 17:12.959
Would you like to know who ate the wafer?
Mr Holmes!

17:12.960 --> 17:16.719
You've been called here
to answer Miss Sorrel's questions,

17:16.720 --> 17:20.358
not to give us a display
of your intellectual prowess.

17:20.359 --> 17:24.079
Keep your answers brief and to the point.

17:24.079 --> 17:26.239
Anything else will be treated as contempt.

17:26.240 --> 17:29.320
Do you think you could survive
for just a few minutes...

17:50.680 --> 17:53.399
What did I say?
I said don't get clever.

17:53.400 --> 17:57.479
I can't just turn it on and off
like a tap. Well? Well, what?

17:57.480 --> 18:00.999
You were there for the whole thing,
up in the gallery, start to finish.

18:01.000 --> 18:04.599
Like you said it would be - sat
on his backside, never even stirred.

18:04.600 --> 18:06.759
Moriarty is not mounting any defence.

18:06.760 --> 18:09.679
Bank of England, Tower of London,
Pentonville.

18:09.680 --> 18:12.279
Three of the most secure places
in the country

18:12.280 --> 18:15.359
and six weeks ago, Moriarty breaks in,

18:15.360 --> 18:17.079
no-one knows how or why.

18:17.080 --> 18:19.880
All we know is...
He ended up in custody.

18:21.760 --> 18:23.959
Don't do that. Do what?

18:23.960 --> 18:26.140
The look. Look? You're doing the look again.

18:26.141 --> 18:28.319
Well, I can't see it, can I?

18:28.320 --> 18:29.799
It's my face.

18:29.800 --> 18:33.399
Yes and you're doing a "We both know
what's really going on here" face.

18:33.400 --> 18:36.479
We do. No, I don't, which is why
I find the face so annoying.

18:36.480 --> 18:38.839
If Moriarty wanted the jewels,
he'd have them.

18:38.840 --> 18:41.759
If he wanted the prisoners freed,
they'd be on the streets.

18:41.760 --> 18:45.399
The reason he's still in a prison
cell is cos he chose to be there.

18:45.400 --> 18:47.200
Somehow this is part of his scheme.

18:57.320 --> 19:01.680
Mr Crayhill,
can we have your first witness?

19:03.600 --> 19:07.079
Your Honour,
we're not calling any witnesses.

19:07.080 --> 19:08.599
I don't follow.

19:08.600 --> 19:11.079
You've entered a plea of not guilty.

19:11.080 --> 19:14.959
Nevertheless,
my client is offering no evidence.

19:14.960 --> 19:17.720
The defence...rests.

19:26.800 --> 19:31.599
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
James Moriarty stands accused...

19:31.600 --> 19:34.080
of several counts of attempted burglary.

19:35.440 --> 19:37.759
Crimes which, if he's found guilty,

19:37.760 --> 19:40.679
will elicit a very long custodial sentence,

19:40.680 --> 19:43.399
and yet...his legal team...

19:43.400 --> 19:47.159
has chosen to offer no evidence whatsoever

19:47.160 --> 19:49.239
to support their plea.

19:49.240 --> 19:51.839
I find myself in the unusual position

19:51.840 --> 19:54.959
of recommending a verdict wholeheartedly.

19:54.960 --> 19:57.880
You must find him guilty.

20:01.200 --> 20:02.359
Guilty.

20:02.360 --> 20:04.280
You must find him guilty.

20:15.040 --> 20:18.399
They're coming back.
That's six minutes.

20:18.400 --> 20:21.359
Surprised it took them
that long, to be honest.

20:21.360 --> 20:23.440
There's a queue for the loo!

20:33.840 --> 20:36.320
Have you reached a verdict
on which you all agree?

20:45.400 --> 20:48.279
Not guilty, they found him not guilty.

20:48.280 --> 20:51.280
No defence and Moriarty's walked free.

20:53.960 --> 20:55.599
Sherlock?

20:55.600 --> 20:59.240
Are you listening? He's out, you know
he'll be coming after you. Sherl...

21:46.560 --> 21:47.880
Most people knock.

21:49.560 --> 21:51.800
But then, you're not most people,
I suppose.

21:52.920 --> 21:54.960
Kettle's just boiled.

21:56.280 --> 21:58.640
Johann Sebastian would be appalled.

22:02.760 --> 22:04.800
May I? Please.

22:10.480 --> 22:13.399
You know when he was on his deathbed, Bach,

22:13.400 --> 22:18.279
he heard his son at the piano
playing one of his...pieces.

22:18.280 --> 22:21.159
The boy stopped before he got to the end.

22:21.160 --> 22:24.319
The dying man jumped out of bed,
ran to the piano and finished it.

22:24.320 --> 22:26.480
Couldn't cope with an unfinished melody.

22:26.481 --> 22:28.639
Neither can you, that's why you've come.

22:28.640 --> 22:31.719
Be honest, you're a tiny bit
pleased. What, with the verdict?

22:31.720 --> 22:34.960
With me, back on the streets.

22:36.200 --> 22:38.960
Every fairy tale needs
a good old-fashioned villain.

22:41.360 --> 22:44.120
You need me or you're nothing.

22:45.600 --> 22:47.959
Because we're just alike, you and I,

22:47.960 --> 22:49.480
except you're boring.

22:50.480 --> 22:52.839
You're on the side of the angels.

22:52.840 --> 22:54.680
You got to the jury, of course.

22:55.840 --> 22:57.919
I got into the Tower of London,

22:57.920 --> 23:00.320
you think I can't worm my way
into 12 hotel rooms?

23:01.320 --> 23:02.519
Cable network.

23:02.520 --> 23:05.760
Every hotel bedroom
has a personalised TV screen.

23:07.640 --> 23:09.959
And every person has their pressure point.

23:09.960 --> 23:13.240
Someone that they want
to protect from harm.

23:14.920 --> 23:16.559
Easy peasy.

23:16.560 --> 23:18.560
So how are you going to do it?

23:20.200 --> 23:21.759
Burn me?

23:21.760 --> 23:25.040
Ah, that's the problem, the final problem.

23:26.800 --> 23:28.520
Have you worked out what it is yet?

23:31.280 --> 23:33.439
What's the final problem?

23:33.440 --> 23:37.200
I did tell you...
but did you listen?

23:50.320 --> 23:53.000
How hard do you find it,
having to say "I don't know"?

23:54.080 --> 23:57.279
I don't know. Oh, that's clever,
very clever, awfully clever.

23:57.280 --> 24:00.959
Speaking of clever, have you
told your little friends yet?

24:00.960 --> 24:02.200
Told them what?

24:02.201 --> 24:05.239
Why I broke into all those places
and never took anything? No.

24:05.240 --> 24:08.279
But you understand? Obviously.
Off you go, then.

24:08.280 --> 24:11.519
Tell you what you already know?
No, prove that you know it.

24:11.520 --> 24:14.799
You didn't take anything
because you don't need to. Good.

24:14.800 --> 24:18.279
You'll never need to take anything
ever again. Very good, because?

24:18.280 --> 24:20.559
Because nothing in the Bank of England,

24:20.560 --> 24:23.959
the Tower of London or Pentonville
Prison could possibly match

24:23.960 --> 24:26.639
the value of the key
that could get you into all three.

24:26.640 --> 24:31.679
I can open any door anywhere with
a few tiny lines of computer code.

24:31.680 --> 24:34.999
No such thing as a private bank
account now, they're all mine.

24:35.000 --> 24:38.160
No such thing as secrecy, I OWN secrecy.

24:39.160 --> 24:40.319
Nuclear codes?

24:40.320 --> 24:42.839
I could blow up NATO in alphabetical order.

24:42.840 --> 24:46.959
In a world of locked rooms,
the man with the key is king.

24:46.960 --> 24:51.040
And honey, you should see me in a crown.

24:52.040 --> 24:54.359
You were advertising all through the trial,

24:54.360 --> 24:56.559
you were showing the world what you can do.

24:56.560 --> 24:58.039
And you were helping.

24:58.040 --> 25:01.839
Big client list - rogue governments,
intelligence communities,

25:01.840 --> 25:03.480
terrorist cells.

25:04.640 --> 25:06.439
They all want me.

25:06.440 --> 25:08.639
Suddenly, I'm Mr Sex.

25:08.640 --> 25:12.439
If you can break any bank, what do
you care about the highest bidder?

25:12.440 --> 25:15.279
I don't, I just like to watch them
all competing.

25:15.280 --> 25:19.079
"Daddy loves me the best."
Aren't ordinary people adorable?

25:19.080 --> 25:23.559
Well, you know, you've got John.
I should get myself a live-in one.

25:23.560 --> 25:27.279
Why are you doing all of this?
It must be so funny.

25:27.280 --> 25:30.719
You don't want money or power, not really.

25:30.720 --> 25:33.119
What is it all for?

25:33.120 --> 25:34.840
I want to solve the problem.

25:37.320 --> 25:38.559
Our problem.

25:38.560 --> 25:40.040
The final problem.

25:43.040 --> 25:47.280
It's going to start
very soon, Sherlock...the fall.

25:48.880 --> 25:51.719
But don't be scared,
falling is just like flying,

25:51.720 --> 25:54.440
except there's a more
permanent destination.

26:02.280 --> 26:03.640
Never liked riddles.

26:07.320 --> 26:08.600
Learn to.

26:10.240 --> 26:12.160
Because I owe you a fall, Sherlock.

26:14.400 --> 26:18.520
I...owe...you.

27:48.880 --> 27:52.720
Er, excuse me,
I'm looking for Mycroft Holmes?

27:56.200 --> 27:58.959
Would you happen to know
if he's around at all?

27:58.960 --> 28:00.399
Can you not hear me?

28:00.400 --> 28:03.199
Yes, all right. Anyone?

28:03.200 --> 28:05.519
Anyone at all know...

28:05.520 --> 28:09.039
where Mycroft Holmes is,
I've been asked to meet him here?

28:09.040 --> 28:12.999
No takers, right. Am I invisible,
can you actually see me?

28:13.000 --> 28:17.560
Ah, thanks, gents. I've been asked to
meet Mycroft Holmes. What the hell?!

28:19.440 --> 28:22.439
Tradition, John, our traditions define us.

28:22.440 --> 28:24.599
So total silence is traditional, is it?

28:24.600 --> 28:26.439
You can't even say pass the sugar?

28:26.440 --> 28:28.599
Three-quarters
of the diplomatic service

28:28.600 --> 28:31.919
and half the government front bench
all sharing one tea trolley,

28:31.920 --> 28:33.599
it's for the best, believe me.

28:33.600 --> 28:38.039
We don't want a repeat of...1972.

28:38.040 --> 28:40.839
But we can talk in here.
You read this stuff?

28:40.840 --> 28:42.279
Caught my eye. Mm-hm.

28:42.280 --> 28:45.599
Saturday, they're doing a big expose.

28:45.600 --> 28:48.399
I'd love to know
where she got her information.

28:48.400 --> 28:51.359
Someone called Brook.
Recognise the name?

28:51.360 --> 28:53.239
School friend, maybe?

28:53.240 --> 28:55.840
Of Sherlock's?

28:56.920 --> 28:59.280
But that's not why I asked you here.

29:06.560 --> 29:09.759
Who's that? Don't know? No.
Never seen his face before?

29:09.760 --> 29:13.159
Um... He's taken a flat in Baker
Street, two doors down from you.

29:13.160 --> 29:16.319
Hm, I was thinking of doing
a drinks thing for the neighbours.

29:16.320 --> 29:18.879
I'm not sure you'll want to.

29:18.880 --> 29:22.639
Sulejmani, Albanian hit squad,
expertly trained killer,

29:22.640 --> 29:25.239
living less than 20 feet
from your front door.

29:25.240 --> 29:28.359
Well, it's a great location.
Jubilee line's handy.

29:28.360 --> 29:30.679
John... What's it got to do with me?

29:30.680 --> 29:32.719
Dyachenko. Ludmila.

29:32.720 --> 29:34.120
Oh...

29:35.480 --> 29:38.079
Actually, I think I have seen her.
Russian killer.

29:38.080 --> 29:40.359
She's taken the flat opposite.

29:40.360 --> 29:41.560
OK.

29:42.600 --> 29:44.799
I'm sensing a pattern here.

29:44.800 --> 29:47.559
In fact, four top
international assassins relocate

29:47.560 --> 29:50.440
to within spitting distance of 221b.

29:51.960 --> 29:54.639
Anything you'd care to share with me?

29:54.640 --> 29:58.319
I'm moving? It's not hard to guess
the common denominator, is it?

29:58.320 --> 30:00.039
You think this is Moriarty?

30:00.040 --> 30:02.639
He promised Sherlock he'd come back.

30:02.640 --> 30:07.120
If this was Moriarty, we'd be dead
already. If not Moriarty, then who?

30:08.440 --> 30:11.839
Why don't you talk to Sherlock,
if you're so concerned about him?

30:11.840 --> 30:15.479
Oh, God, don't tell me.

30:15.480 --> 30:17.359
Too much history between us, John.

30:17.360 --> 30:20.559
Old scores, resentments.

30:20.560 --> 30:23.120
Nicked all his Smurfs?
Broke his Action Man?

30:27.800 --> 30:28.880
Finished.

30:30.080 --> 30:32.279
We both know what's coming, John.

30:32.280 --> 30:36.559
Moriarty is obsessed, he's sworn
to destroy his only rival.

30:36.560 --> 30:38.500
So you want me to watch out for your

30:38.501 --> 30:40.439
brother because he won't accept your help?

30:40.440 --> 30:42.600
If it's not too much trouble?

31:25.680 --> 31:27.720
Excuse me. Sorry.

31:35.360 --> 31:39.399
Sherlock, something weird... What's
going on? Kidnapping. Rufus Bruhl.

31:39.400 --> 31:42.919
The ambassador to the US.
He's in Washington, isn't he?

31:42.920 --> 31:45.999
Not him, his children. Max
and Claudette, age seven and nine.

31:46.000 --> 31:48.839
They're at St Aldates.
Posh boarding place in Surrey.

31:48.840 --> 31:50.879
School broke up, the boarders went home.

31:50.880 --> 31:52.840
A few kids remained, including those two.

31:52.841 --> 31:54.799
The kids have vanished.

31:54.800 --> 31:58.440
The ambassador's asked for you
personally. The Reichenbach hero.

32:00.640 --> 32:02.920
Isn't it great
to be working with a celebrity?

32:12.800 --> 32:16.399
We shouldn't need to keep you
for much longer. Thank you.

32:16.400 --> 32:19.879
It's all right. Miss Mackenzie,
House Mistress. Go easy.

32:19.880 --> 32:22.519
Miss Mackenzie,
you're in charge of pupil welfare,

32:22.520 --> 32:24.839
yet you left this place
wide open last night.

32:24.840 --> 32:27.999
What are you, an idiot, a drunk or
a criminal?! Quickly, tell me!

32:28.000 --> 32:30.719
All the doors and windows
were properly bolted.

32:30.720 --> 32:34.359
No-one, not even me,
went into their room last night.

32:34.360 --> 32:37.479
You have to believe me! I do,
I just wanted you to speak quickly.

32:37.480 --> 32:39.960
Miss Mackenzie will need
to breath into a bag now.

32:46.920 --> 32:50.199
Six grand a term, you'd expect them
to keep the kids safe for you.

32:50.200 --> 32:52.959
You said the other kids
had all left on their holidays.

32:52.960 --> 32:55.399
They were the only two
sleeping on this floor.

32:55.400 --> 32:57.639
There's absolutely
no sign of a break-in.

32:57.640 --> 33:01.160
The intruder must have been
hidden inside some place.

33:14.480 --> 33:16.760
Show me where the brother slept.

33:29.760 --> 33:31.480
The boy sleeps there every night.

33:32.480 --> 33:35.319
Gazing at the only light source
outside in the corridor.

33:35.320 --> 33:37.799
He'd recognise every shape, every outline,

33:37.800 --> 33:40.199
the silhouette of everyone
who came to the door.

33:40.200 --> 33:44.199
OK, so? So if someone approaches
the door who he doesn't recognise,

33:44.200 --> 33:47.080
an intruder, maybe he can even see
the outline of a weapon.

33:51.160 --> 33:53.319
What would he do?

33:53.320 --> 33:56.239
In the precious few seconds
before they came into the room,

33:56.240 --> 33:58.719
how would he use them if not to cry out?

33:58.720 --> 34:01.599
This little boy,
this particular little boy,

34:01.600 --> 34:05.079
who reads all of those spy books,
what would he do?

34:05.080 --> 34:06.240
He'd leave a sign?

34:19.080 --> 34:20.120
Get Anderson!

34:22.520 --> 34:23.719
Linseed oil.

34:24.960 --> 34:28.599
Not much use, it doesn't lead us to
the kidnapper. Brilliant, Anderson.

34:28.600 --> 34:31.400
Really? Yes, brilliant
impression of an idiot.

34:32.800 --> 34:33.840
Floor.

34:34.800 --> 34:38.759
He...made a trail for us. The boy
was made to walk ahead of them.

34:38.760 --> 34:41.559
On what, tiptoe? Indicates anxiety.

34:41.560 --> 34:43.000
Gun held to his head.

34:44.480 --> 34:47.478
The girl was pulled beside him,
dragged sideways.

34:47.480 --> 34:50.080
He had his left arm cradled about her neck.

34:51.520 --> 34:54.518
That's the end of it, we don't know
where they went from here.

34:54.520 --> 34:56.719
Tells us nothing after all.

34:56.719 --> 34:59.240
You're right, Anderson, nothing.

35:00.640 --> 35:03.960
Except his shoe size, his height,
his gait, his walking pace.

35:13.640 --> 35:15.960
Having fun? Starting to.

35:17.040 --> 35:19.920
Maybe don't do the smiling.
Kidnapped children?

35:28.680 --> 35:31.759
How could he get past the CCTV?
If all the doors were locked.

35:31.760 --> 35:33.839
He walked in when they weren't locked.

35:33.840 --> 35:36.719
But a stranger can't just
walk into a school like that.

35:36.720 --> 35:40.279
Anyone can walk in anywhere
if they pick the right moment.

35:40.280 --> 35:43.759
Yesterday, end of term, parents
milling around, chauffeurs, staff.

35:43.760 --> 35:45.800
What's one more stranger among that lot?

35:48.360 --> 35:49.920
He was waiting for them.

35:51.040 --> 35:53.120
All he had to do was find a place to hide.

36:02.200 --> 36:03.239
Molly!

36:03.240 --> 36:06.399
Hello, I'm just going out. No,
you're not. I've got a lunch date.

36:06.400 --> 36:09.039
Cancel it, have lunch with me.
What? I need your help.

36:09.040 --> 36:11.679
One of your old boyfriends,
we're tracking him down.

36:11.680 --> 36:14.479
He's been naughty. Moriarty?
Of course it's Moriarty!

36:14.480 --> 36:17.479
Jim wasn't my boyfriend,
we went out three times. I ended it.

36:17.480 --> 36:19.960
Then he stole the Crown
Jewels, broke into the

36:19.961 --> 36:22.439
Bank of England and
organised a prison break.

36:22.440 --> 36:24.820
For the sake of law and
order, I suggest you avoid

36:24.821 --> 36:27.200
all future attempts at
a relationship, Molly.

36:30.520 --> 36:34.239
Oil, John. The oil
in the kidnapper's footprint.

36:34.240 --> 36:36.119
It'll lead us to Moriarty.

36:36.120 --> 36:39.839
All the chemical traces on his shoe
have been preserved.

36:39.840 --> 36:42.240
The sole of the shoe is like a passport.

36:42.241 --> 36:44.640
If we're lucky, we'll see
everything he's been up to.

36:48.200 --> 36:49.960
I need that analysis.

36:52.760 --> 36:53.799
Alkaline.

36:53.800 --> 36:56.800
Thank you, John. Molly. Yes.

37:19.880 --> 37:22.680
I...O...U.

37:24.640 --> 37:26.680
Glycerol molecule.

37:27.800 --> 37:29.920
What are you?

37:34.640 --> 37:36.080
What did you mean, IOU?

37:37.880 --> 37:39.280
You said IOU.

37:40.320 --> 37:43.720
You were muttering it while you were
working. Nothing, mental note.

37:45.880 --> 37:49.279
You're a bit like my dad. He's dead.
No, sorry.

37:49.280 --> 37:51.340
Molly, please don't feel the need to make

37:51.341 --> 37:53.399
conversation, it's really not your area.

37:53.400 --> 37:56.239
When he was dying, he was
always cheerful, he was lovely,

37:56.240 --> 37:59.200
except when he thought
no-one could see.

38:00.440 --> 38:04.040
I saw him once, he looked sad.
Molly.

38:05.160 --> 38:09.160
You look sad,
when you think he can't see you.

38:13.440 --> 38:17.119
Are you OK? And don't just say you
are, because I know what that means,

38:17.120 --> 38:19.600
looking sad when you think
no-one can see you.

38:21.160 --> 38:23.680
You can see me. I don't count.

38:24.720 --> 38:28.359
What I'm trying to say is,
that if there's anything I can do,

38:28.360 --> 38:31.159
anything you need, anything at all,
you can have me.

38:31.160 --> 38:37.800
No, I just mean, I mean, if there's
anything you need, it's fine.

38:40.280 --> 38:41.840
But what can I need from you?

38:42.920 --> 38:45.439
Nothing. I don't know.

38:45.440 --> 38:48.600
You could probably say thank you, actually.

38:50.320 --> 38:51.559
Thank you?

38:51.560 --> 38:55.639
I'm just going to go and get
some crisps. Do you want anything?

38:55.640 --> 38:58.319
It's OK, I know you don't.

38:58.320 --> 39:01.400
Well, actually, maybe I'll...
I know you don't.

39:11.280 --> 39:13.079
Sherlock? Hmm?

39:13.080 --> 39:18.679
This envelope that was in her trunk,
there's another one. What?

39:18.680 --> 39:23.720
On our doorstep. Found it today.
Yes, and look at that.

39:25.400 --> 39:28.000
Look at that, exactly the same seal.

39:33.880 --> 39:36.759
Breadcrumbs. Uh-huh.
It was there when I got back.

39:36.760 --> 39:38.999
A little trace of breadcrumbs.

39:39.000 --> 39:41.200
Hardback copy of Fairy Tales.

39:42.280 --> 39:44.620
Two children led into the forest by a wicked

39:44.621 --> 39:46.959
father, follow a little
trail of breadcrumbs.

39:46.960 --> 39:50.959
That's Hansel and Gretel.
What sort of kidnapper leaves clues?

39:50.960 --> 39:53.599
The sort that likes to boast,
that thinks it's a game.

39:53.600 --> 39:56.839
He sat in our flat and he said
these exact words to me...

39:56.840 --> 39:59.600
"All fairy tales need
a good old-fashioned villain."

40:00.680 --> 40:05.640
The fifth substance, it's part of
the tale. The witch's house. What?

40:07.240 --> 40:08.800
The glycerol molecule.

40:12.840 --> 40:15.720
PGPR! What's that?
It's used in making chocolate.

40:24.000 --> 40:25.680
This fax arrived an hour ago.

40:28.920 --> 40:30.280
What have you got for us?

40:30.281 --> 40:32.140
We need to find a place in the city where

40:32.141 --> 40:33.999
all five of these things intersect.

40:34.000 --> 40:36.239
Chalk, asphalt, brick dust, vegetation.

40:36.240 --> 40:40.119
What - chocolate?! I think we're
looking for a disused sweet factory.

40:40.120 --> 40:43.559
We need to narrow that down.
A sweet factory with asphalt?

40:43.560 --> 40:45.719
No, too general.
Something more specific.

40:45.720 --> 40:48.680
Chalk, chalky clay. That's a far
thinner band of geology.

40:51.600 --> 40:52.640
Brick dust?

40:53.880 --> 40:56.039
Building site.
Bricks from the 1950s.

40:56.040 --> 40:58.599
There's thousands of building sites
in London.

40:58.600 --> 41:00.999
I've got people out looking.
So have I!

41:01.000 --> 41:03.439
Homeless network, faster than the police,

41:03.440 --> 41:06.120
far more relaxed about taking bribes.

41:19.840 --> 41:20.919
John.

41:20.920 --> 41:24.480
Rhododendron ponticum. Matches.

41:29.440 --> 41:30.680
Addlestone. What?

41:30.681 --> 41:34.959
A mile of disused factories between the
river and the park, matches everything.

41:34.960 --> 41:36.400
Right, come on. Come on!

41:48.360 --> 41:49.919
OK, you look over there.

41:49.920 --> 41:51.000
Look everywhere.

41:51.001 --> 41:54.480
OK, spread out, please, spread out.

41:56.200 --> 41:58.520
Quietly, quietly!

42:03.360 --> 42:07.799
This was alight moments ago.
They're still here! Sweet wrappers?

42:07.800 --> 42:12.560
What's he been feeding you?
Hansel and Gretel.

42:19.720 --> 42:20.759
Ugh!

42:20.760 --> 42:22.119
Mercury. What?

42:22.120 --> 42:24.759
The papers, they're painted
with mercury, lethal.

42:24.760 --> 42:25.880
The more they ate...

42:25.881 --> 42:29.559
It was killing them. But it's not
enough to kill them on its own.

42:29.560 --> 42:33.199
Taken in large enough quantities,
eventually it would kill them.

42:33.200 --> 42:36.159
He didn't need to be there
for the execution.

42:36.160 --> 42:40.000
Murder by remote control,
he could be 1,000 miles away.

42:43.200 --> 42:47.359
The hungrier they got, the more they
ate, the faster they died. Neat.

42:47.360 --> 42:49.600
Sherlock. Over here!

42:52.000 --> 42:53.880
I've got him, don't worry.

43:02.200 --> 43:04.599
Right then, the professionals are finished.

43:04.600 --> 43:07.000
If the amateurs want to go in
and have their turn.

43:07.001 --> 43:10.119
Now remember, she's in shock
and she's just seven years old,

43:10.120 --> 43:12.199
so, anything you can do to...

43:12.200 --> 43:14.600
Not be myself?
Yeah, might be helpful.

43:24.280 --> 43:25.679
Claudette, I...

43:25.680 --> 43:28.519
No, no, I know it's been hard for you.

43:28.520 --> 43:31.320
Claudette, listen to me.
Out. Get out!

43:34.800 --> 43:36.999
Makes no sense.
Kid's traumatised.

43:37.000 --> 43:41.079
Something about Sherlock reminds her
of the kidnapper. What's she said?

43:41.080 --> 43:44.759
Hasn't uttered another syllable.
And the boy? No, he's unconscious.

43:44.760 --> 43:46.880
He's still in intensive care.

44:00.720 --> 44:01.880
Don't let it get to you,

44:01.881 --> 44:04.599
I always feel like screaming
when you walk into a room.

44:04.600 --> 44:06.240
In fact, so do most people.

44:07.400 --> 44:08.440
Come on.

44:13.000 --> 44:16.239
Brilliant work you did finding
those kids from just a footprint,

44:16.240 --> 44:17.400
it's really amazing.

44:17.401 --> 44:18.559
Thank you.

44:18.560 --> 44:19.920
Unbelievable.

44:30.160 --> 44:31.480
Ah.

44:34.120 --> 44:35.680
You OK? Thinking.

44:38.040 --> 44:41.480
This is my cab, you get the next
one. Why? You might talk.

44:53.840 --> 44:57.199
'Is this chocolate?' 'We're looking
for a disused sweet factory.'

44:57.200 --> 44:58.919
'Get out!'

44:58.920 --> 45:00.480
'Aaaargh!'

45:02.440 --> 45:03.520
Problem?

45:13.760 --> 45:18.959
'..this stunning evening wear set
from us at London Taxi Shopping.

45:18.960 --> 45:23.119
Can you turn this off, please? 'The
set comprises of a beautiful...'

45:23.120 --> 45:25.079
Can you turn this off?!

45:25.080 --> 45:28.320
'Accompanied by four
spangly diamond bracelets...'

45:29.640 --> 45:30.679
Hello.

45:30.680 --> 45:33.639
Are you ready for the story?

45:33.640 --> 45:36.200
This is the story
of Sir Boast-a-lot.

45:37.640 --> 45:40.719
A footprint, it's all he had.

45:40.720 --> 45:42.719
A footprint.

45:42.720 --> 45:46.359
Yeah, well, you know what he's like.
CSI Baker Street.

45:46.360 --> 45:48.519
Well, our boys couldn't have done it.

45:48.520 --> 45:52.799
Well, that's why we need him,
he's better. That's one explanation.

45:52.800 --> 45:54.479
And what's the other?

45:54.480 --> 45:58.679
Sir Boast-a-lot was the bravest and
cleverest knight at the round table.

45:58.680 --> 46:02.519
But soon the other knights began
to grow tired of his stories

46:02.520 --> 46:05.760
about how brave he was
and how many dragons he'd slain.

46:07.080 --> 46:12.919
And soon they began to wonder, "Are
Sir Boast-a-lot's stories even true?"

46:12.920 --> 46:15.000
Only he could have found that evidence.

46:16.000 --> 46:17.439
Oh, no.

46:17.440 --> 46:19.380
The girl screams her head off when she sees

46:19.381 --> 46:21.319
him - a man she has never seen before,

46:21.320 --> 46:23.999
unless she had seen him before.
What's your point?

46:24.000 --> 46:26.879
You know what it is, you just
don't want to think about it.

46:26.880 --> 46:30.159
So, all of the knights
went to King Arthur and said,

46:30.160 --> 46:34.719
"I don't believe
Sir Boast-a-lot's stories.

46:34.720 --> 46:39.880
"He's just a big old liar who makes
things up to make himself look good."

46:43.320 --> 46:46.239
You're not seriously suggesting
he's involved, are you?

46:46.240 --> 46:48.320
We have to entertain the possibility.

46:49.280 --> 46:53.000
And then, even the King began to wonder.

46:57.200 --> 47:00.760
But that wasn't the end
of Sir Boast-a-lot's problem.

47:01.920 --> 47:03.080
No.

47:05.800 --> 47:08.040
That wasn't the final problem.

47:09.520 --> 47:11.560
The end.

47:13.520 --> 47:15.119
Stop the cab.

47:15.120 --> 47:16.719
Stop the cab!

47:16.720 --> 47:17.880
What was that?!

47:19.640 --> 47:21.959
What was that?

47:21.960 --> 47:23.000
No charge.

47:29.760 --> 47:30.840
Watch out!

47:36.840 --> 47:38.040
Thank you.

47:51.200 --> 47:52.240
Sherlock!

47:58.880 --> 48:00.559
That is him. It's him.

48:00.560 --> 48:03.439
Sulejmani or something,
Mycroft showed me his file.

48:03.440 --> 48:06.359
He's a big Albanian gangster,
lives two doors down from us.

48:06.360 --> 48:08.320
He died because I shook his hand.
What?

48:08.321 --> 48:10.880
He saved my life,
but he couldn't touch me. Why?

48:12.720 --> 48:15.039
Four assassins
living right on our doorstep.

48:15.040 --> 48:16.959
They haven't come here to kill me.

48:16.960 --> 48:18.559
They have to keep me alive.

48:18.560 --> 48:21.879
I've got something that all of them want.

48:21.880 --> 48:23.640
But if one of them approaches me...

48:23.641 --> 48:25.920
The others kill them
before they can get it.

48:28.680 --> 48:31.720
All of the attention is focused on me.

48:33.360 --> 48:36.359
There's a surveillance web
closing in on us right now.

48:36.360 --> 48:38.640
So what have you got that's so important?

48:40.400 --> 48:41.999
I need to ask about the dusting.

48:42.000 --> 48:45.279
Precise details, in the last week,
what's been cleaned?

48:45.280 --> 48:49.319
Tuesday, I did your lino. No, this
room, this is where we'll find it.

48:49.320 --> 48:51.300
Any break in the dust line.

48:51.301 --> 48:53.279
You can put back anything but dust.
Dust is eloquent.

48:53.280 --> 48:54.760
What's he on about?

48:56.400 --> 48:57.999
Cameras, we're being watched.

48:58.000 --> 49:00.599
What?! Cameras? Here?

49:00.600 --> 49:03.560
I'm in my nightie!

49:20.600 --> 49:22.399
No, Inspector. Why?

49:22.400 --> 49:24.839
The answer's no.
You've not heard the question!

49:24.840 --> 49:28.319
You want to take me to the station.
Saving you the trouble of asking.

49:28.320 --> 49:30.079
Sherlock.

49:30.080 --> 49:32.199
The scream? Yeah.

49:32.200 --> 49:34.359
Who was it? Donovan?
I bet it was Donovan.

49:34.360 --> 49:36.759
"Am I somehow responsible
for the kidnapping?"

49:36.760 --> 49:38.359
Ha ha, Moriarty is smart.

49:38.360 --> 49:42.279
He planted that doubt in her head.
That little nagging sensation.

49:42.280 --> 49:44.559
You're going to have to be strong
to resist.

49:44.560 --> 49:47.079
You can't kill an idea, can you?

49:47.080 --> 49:50.320
Not once it's made a home...there.

49:52.880 --> 49:55.759
Will you come? One photograph,
that's his next move.

49:55.760 --> 49:57.199
Moriarty's game.

49:57.200 --> 50:01.119
First the scream, then a photograph
of me being taken in for questioning.

50:01.120 --> 50:03.279
He wants to destroy me inch by inch.

50:03.280 --> 50:07.520
It is a game, Lestrade,
and not one I'm willing to play.

50:08.880 --> 50:10.880
Give my regards to Sergeant Donovan.

50:43.040 --> 50:45.479
They'll be deciding. Deciding?

50:45.480 --> 50:48.959
Whether to come back with a warrant
and arrest me. You think?

50:48.960 --> 50:52.599
Standard procedure. You should have
gone with him. People'll think...

50:52.600 --> 50:54.559
I don't care what people think.

50:54.560 --> 50:57.599
You'd care if they thought
you were stupid or wrong.

50:57.600 --> 50:59.999
No, that would just make them
stupid or wrong.

51:00.000 --> 51:02.720
Sherlock, I don't want the world
believing you're...

51:05.920 --> 51:07.280
That I am what?

51:09.840 --> 51:10.880
A fraud.

51:12.600 --> 51:14.960
You're worried they're right. What?

51:14.961 --> 51:17.319
That they're right about me.
No. That's why you're upset.

51:17.320 --> 51:20.079
You can't entertain the possibility
they may be right.

51:20.080 --> 51:22.439
You're afraid you've been taken in.
I'm not.

51:22.440 --> 51:26.120
Moriarty is playing with your mind,
too. Can't you SEE what's going on?!

51:29.720 --> 51:32.399
No, I know you for real.
100 percent?

51:32.400 --> 51:35.880
Well, nobody could fake being such
an annoying dick all the time.

51:41.680 --> 51:43.919
Sherlock Holmes? Yes, sir.

51:43.920 --> 51:46.159
That bloke that's been in the press?

51:46.160 --> 51:47.480
Mm-hm.

51:48.640 --> 51:50.799
I thought he was some sort of private eye.

51:50.800 --> 51:54.279
He is. We've been consulting with
him, that's what you're telling me?

51:54.280 --> 51:57.399
Not used him on any proper cases
though, have we?

51:57.400 --> 51:58.640
Well, one or two.

51:58.641 --> 52:00.279
Or 20 or 30.

52:00.280 --> 52:01.719
What?!

52:01.720 --> 52:05.039
I'm not the only senior officer
who did this. Gregson... Shut up!

52:05.040 --> 52:09.839
An amateur detective given access to
all sorts of classified information.

52:09.840 --> 52:12.959
And now he's a suspect in a case.

52:12.960 --> 52:15.839
With all due respect...
You're a bloody idiot, Lestrade!

52:15.840 --> 52:17.560
Now go and fetch him in, right now.

52:17.561 --> 52:19.120
Do it!

52:24.680 --> 52:28.079
Proud of yourselves? Well,
what if it's not just this case?

52:28.080 --> 52:30.960
What if he's done this to us
every single time?

52:42.760 --> 52:46.119
So, still got some friends
on the force. It's Lestrade.

52:46.120 --> 52:48.078
Says they're all coming over here now.

52:48.079 --> 52:49.920
Queuing up to slap on the handcuffs.

52:49.921 --> 52:52.359
Every officer
you've ever made feel like a tit,

52:52.360 --> 52:53.640
which is a lot of people.

52:53.641 --> 52:55.479
Yoo-hoo.

52:55.480 --> 52:57.399
Oh, sorry, am I interrupting?

52:57.400 --> 53:01.359
Some chap delivered a parcel,
I forgot, marked perishable.

53:01.360 --> 53:03.799
I had to sign for it.

53:03.800 --> 53:07.600
Funny name, German, like the fairy tales.

53:16.680 --> 53:18.000
Burnt to a crisp.

53:20.000 --> 53:21.959
What does it mean?

53:21.960 --> 53:23.799
'Police!' I'll go.

53:23.800 --> 53:25.359
'Sherlock.

53:25.360 --> 53:27.839
'Excuse me, Mrs Hudson.
We need to talk to you.

53:27.840 --> 53:30.200
'You can't just barge in like that!'

53:31.440 --> 53:33.479
- 'Have you got a warrant?
- Have you?'

53:33.480 --> 53:34.960
'Leave it, John.

53:34.961 --> 53:37.039
'Eh? Manners!'

53:37.040 --> 53:41.879
Sherlock Holmes, I'm arresting you on
suspicion of abduction and kidnapping.

53:41.880 --> 53:43.639
It's OK, John. He's not resisting.

53:43.640 --> 53:45.879
No, it's not all right, this is ridiculous.

53:45.880 --> 53:47.199
Get him downstairs now.

53:47.200 --> 53:48.480
You don't have to do this.

53:48.481 --> 53:51.000
Don't try to interfere
or I shall arrest you too.

53:55.120 --> 53:56.319
You done?

53:56.320 --> 53:57.400
I said it. Hmm?

53:57.401 --> 53:59.439
First time we met. Don't bother.

53:59.440 --> 54:03.279
Solving crimes won't be enough.
One day he'll cross the line.

54:03.280 --> 54:07.439
Now ask yourself, what sort of man
would kidnap those kids

54:07.440 --> 54:09.679
just so he can impress us all
by finding them?

54:09.680 --> 54:14.159
Donovan? Sir? Got our man?
Er, yes, sir.

54:14.160 --> 54:16.439
Looked a bit of a weirdo, if you ask me.

54:16.440 --> 54:19.920
Often are, these vigilante types.

54:21.920 --> 54:23.200
What are you looking at?

54:25.520 --> 54:26.960
Are you all right, sir?

54:28.960 --> 54:30.879
Joining me? Yeah.

54:30.880 --> 54:35.119
Well, apparently it's against the law
to chin the Chief Superintendent.

54:35.120 --> 54:37.079
Hmm. Bit awkward this.

54:37.080 --> 54:39.399
There's no-one to bail us.

54:39.400 --> 54:42.799
I was thinking more about
our imminent and daring escape.

54:42.800 --> 54:46.199
'All units to 27.' What?

54:46.200 --> 54:47.759
'All units to 2...'

54:47.760 --> 54:51.239
Aah!

54:51.240 --> 54:54.400
Ladies and gentlemen, will you all
please get on your knees?

54:55.600 --> 54:58.920
NOW would be good! Do as he says!

55:00.800 --> 55:04.599
Just so you're aware, the gun
is his idea, I'm just a...you know.

55:04.600 --> 55:08.839
My hostage. Hostage, yes,
that works. That works.

55:08.840 --> 55:10.279
So what now?

55:10.280 --> 55:14.320
Doing what Moriarty wants,
becoming a fugitive. Run!

55:18.120 --> 55:20.320
Get after him, Lestrade!

55:21.720 --> 55:23.120
Take my hand.

55:25.480 --> 55:28.520
Now people will definitely talk.
The gun! Leave it!

55:35.920 --> 55:37.160
Sherlock, wait!

55:38.960 --> 55:41.480
We're going to need to coordinate.

55:42.640 --> 55:45.200
Go to your right. Huh?
Go to your right.

55:48.840 --> 55:52.479
Everybody wants to believe it,
that's what makes it so clever.

55:52.480 --> 55:54.360
A lie that's preferable to the truth.

55:54.361 --> 55:56.420
My deductions were a sham.

55:56.421 --> 55:58.479
No-one feels inadequate,
Sherlock's an ordinary man.

55:58.480 --> 56:00.639
Mycroft, he could help us.

56:00.640 --> 56:04.440
Big family reconciliation,
now's not really the moment.

56:06.200 --> 56:10.359
Sherlock...we're being followed.
I knew we couldn't outrun the police.

56:10.360 --> 56:13.879
That's not the police, it's one of
my new neighbours from Baker Street.

56:13.880 --> 56:16.240
Let's see if he can give us some answers.

56:21.360 --> 56:22.839
Where are we going?

56:22.840 --> 56:26.080
We're going to jump in front of that bus.

56:31.760 --> 56:32.800
Oof!

56:34.680 --> 56:35.840
Oh...

56:36.800 --> 56:39.479
Tell me what you want from me.

56:39.480 --> 56:41.399
Tell me!

56:41.400 --> 56:42.799
He left it at your flat.

56:42.800 --> 56:45.079
Who? Moriarty.

56:45.080 --> 56:46.559
What?

56:46.560 --> 56:48.759
The computer key code. Of course.

56:48.760 --> 56:52.320
He's selling it. The programme
he used to break into the Tower.

56:54.600 --> 56:56.920
He planted it when he came around.

57:12.920 --> 57:14.399
It's a game-changer.

57:14.400 --> 57:16.839
It's a key, it can break into any system

57:16.840 --> 57:19.599
and it's sitting in our flat right now.

57:19.600 --> 57:21.640
That's why he left that message, telling

57:21.641 --> 57:23.679
everyone where to come, "Get Sherlock!"

57:23.680 --> 57:27.159
We need to get back into the flat
and search. CID will be camped out.

57:27.160 --> 57:28.599
Why plant it on you?

57:28.600 --> 57:30.879
It's another subtle way
of smearing my name,

57:30.880 --> 57:33.160
now I'm best pals with all those criminals.

57:35.560 --> 57:37.239
Yeah, well, have you seen this?

57:37.240 --> 57:39.159
A kiss-and-tell.

57:39.160 --> 57:41.120
Some bloke called Rich Brook.

57:43.320 --> 57:44.600
Who is he?

58:10.080 --> 58:12.320
Too late to go on the record?

58:13.720 --> 58:16.759
Congratulations,
"The Truth About Sherlock Holmes."

58:16.760 --> 58:19.919
The scoop that everybody wanted
and you got it. Bravo!

58:19.920 --> 58:21.879
I gave you your opportunity.

58:21.880 --> 58:24.079
I wanted to be on your side, remember?

58:24.080 --> 58:25.360
You turned me down, so...

58:25.361 --> 58:28.239
Then lo and behold,
someone spills all the beans.

58:28.240 --> 58:31.479
How utterly convenient.
Who is Brook?

58:31.480 --> 58:34.799
Oh, come on, Kitty, no-one trusts
the voice at the end of a phone.

58:34.800 --> 58:36.879
All those little meetings in cafes,

58:36.880 --> 58:40.439
those sessions in the hotel room when
he gabbled into your Dictaphone.

58:40.440 --> 58:42.679
How do you know that you can trust him?

58:42.680 --> 58:45.959
A man turns up
with the Holy Grail in his pockets.

58:45.960 --> 58:47.440
What were his credentials?

58:50.000 --> 58:53.760
Darling, they didn't have any
ground coffee, so I just got normal.

59:00.320 --> 59:04.559
You said that they wouldn't find me
here, you said that I'd be safe here.

59:04.560 --> 59:05.599
You are safe.

59:05.600 --> 59:09.039
Richard, I'm a witness, they wouldn't
harm you in front of witnesses.

59:09.040 --> 59:12.439
So that's your source?
Moriarty is Richard Brook?

59:12.440 --> 59:15.199
Of course he's Richard Brook,
there is no Moriarty.

59:15.200 --> 59:19.039
There never has been. What are you
talking about? Look him up.

59:19.040 --> 59:23.760
Rich Brook, an actor Sherlock Holmes
hired to be Moriarty.

59:29.120 --> 59:31.439
Dr Watson, I know you're a good man,

59:31.440 --> 59:34.799
don't, don't, don't hurt me.

59:34.800 --> 59:37.799
No, you are Moriarty!
He's Moriarty!

59:37.800 --> 59:40.799
We've met, remember?
You were going to blow me up!

59:40.800 --> 59:43.279
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

59:43.280 --> 59:46.919
He paid me, I needed the work.
I'm an actor, I was out of work.

59:46.920 --> 59:50.159
Sherlock, you'd better explain,
because I am not getting this.

59:50.160 --> 59:52.879
I'll be doing the explaining, in print.

59:52.880 --> 59:55.640
It's all here, conclusive proof.

59:57.240 --> 59:59.639
You invented James Moriarty, your nemesis.

59:59.640 --> 01:00:01.479
Invented him?! Mm-hm.

01:00:01.480 --> 01:00:03.919
He invented all the crimes, actually.

01:00:03.920 --> 01:00:06.439
And to cap it all,
he made up a master villain.

01:00:06.440 --> 01:00:10.079
Don't be ridiculous! Ask him.
He's right here. Just ask him.

01:00:10.080 --> 01:00:13.359
Tell him, Richard. For God's sake,
this man was on trial!

01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:17.199
Yes, and you paid him to take the
rap. Promised you'd rig the jury.

01:00:17.200 --> 01:00:20.639
Not exactly a West End role,
but I'll bet the money was good.

01:00:20.640 --> 01:00:23.519
But not so good he didn't
want to sell his story.

01:00:23.520 --> 01:00:26.079
I am sorry. I am. I am sorry.

01:00:26.080 --> 01:00:28.719
So this is the story
you're going to publish?

01:00:28.720 --> 01:00:32.919
The big conclusion of it all,
Moriarty's an actor? He knows I am.

01:00:32.920 --> 01:00:35.919
I have proof. Show them...
Kitty, show them something.

01:00:35.920 --> 01:00:37.920
Yeah, show me something.

01:00:42.520 --> 01:00:46.280
I'm on TV. I'm on kids' TV.
I'm the story-teller.

01:00:49.040 --> 01:00:52.640
I'm the story-teller. It's on DVD.

01:01:00.120 --> 01:01:03.079
Just tell him.
It's all coming out. It's all over.

01:01:03.080 --> 01:01:06.559
Just tell them. Just tell them.
Tell them! It's all over now!

01:01:06.560 --> 01:01:09.599
No! Don't you touch me!
Don't you lay a finger on me!

01:01:09.600 --> 01:01:11.639
Stop it now!

01:01:11.640 --> 01:01:14.199
Don't hurt me!
Don't let him get away!

01:01:14.200 --> 01:01:16.520
Leave him alone!

01:01:19.400 --> 01:01:21.519
No, no, no. He'll have back-up.

01:01:21.520 --> 01:01:23.479
Do you know what, Sherlock Holmes?

01:01:23.480 --> 01:01:29.000
I look at you know and I can
read you...and you repel me.

01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:35.479
Can he do that?

01:01:35.480 --> 01:01:38.359
Completely change his identity,
make you the criminal?

01:01:38.360 --> 01:01:40.279
He's got my whole life story.

01:01:40.280 --> 01:01:42.359
That's what you do when you sell a big lie,

01:01:42.360 --> 01:01:44.999
you wrap it up in the truth
to make it more palatable.

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:46.839
It'll be your word against his.

01:01:46.840 --> 01:01:50.039
He's been sowing doubt into
people's minds for 24 hours.

01:01:50.040 --> 01:01:54.040
There's only one thing he needs to
do to complete his game and that...

01:01:55.040 --> 01:01:56.480
Sherlock?

01:01:57.480 --> 01:02:01.600
There's something I need to do.
What? Can I help? No, on my own.

01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:20.280
You're wrong, you know?

01:02:21.720 --> 01:02:23.480
You do count.

01:02:24.480 --> 01:02:28.000
You've always counted
and I've always trusted you.

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.320
But you were right.

01:02:33.320 --> 01:02:35.119
I'm not OK.

01:02:35.120 --> 01:02:37.400
Tell me what's wrong.

01:02:39.480 --> 01:02:42.680
Molly, I think I'm going to die.

01:02:44.680 --> 01:02:48.119
What do you need? If I wasn't
everything that you think I am,

01:02:48.120 --> 01:02:50.320
everything that I think I am...

01:02:51.320 --> 01:02:53.640
..would you still want to help me?

01:02:55.080 --> 01:02:57.440
What do you need?

01:03:04.360 --> 01:03:06.360
You.

01:03:19.520 --> 01:03:24.039
She has really done her homework,
Miss Riley,

01:03:24.040 --> 01:03:28.040
and it's things that only someone
close to Sherlock could know.

01:03:29.040 --> 01:03:32.519
Ah. Have you seen your brother's
address book lately?

01:03:32.520 --> 01:03:36.039
Two names - yours and mine...

01:03:36.040 --> 01:03:39.039
and Moriarty didn't get this stuff from me.

01:03:39.040 --> 01:03:42.559
John... So how does it work,
your relationship?

01:03:42.560 --> 01:03:46.239
Do you go out for a coffee
now and then, you and Jim?

01:03:46.240 --> 01:03:48.439
Your own brother

01:03:48.440 --> 01:03:54.320
and you blabbed about his entire
life to this maniac.

01:03:56.320 --> 01:03:59.039
I never intend...I never dreamt...

01:03:59.040 --> 01:04:03.119
This...this is what you were
trying to tell me, isn't it?

01:04:03.120 --> 01:04:06.040
"Watch his back
because I've made a mistake."

01:04:09.560 --> 01:04:11.600
How did you meet him?

01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:19.360
People like him,
we know about them, we watch them.

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.040
But James Moriarty...

01:04:25.040 --> 01:04:29.319
..the most dangerous criminal mind
the world has ever seen,

01:04:29.320 --> 01:04:32.439
and, in his pocket, the ultimate weapon.

01:04:32.440 --> 01:04:34.559
The key code.

01:04:34.560 --> 01:04:38.520
A few lines of computer code
that can unlock any door.

01:04:39.520 --> 01:04:44.040
And you abducted him
to try and find the key code?

01:04:45.040 --> 01:04:47.559
Interrogated him for weeks.

01:04:47.560 --> 01:04:50.600
And? He wouldn't play along.

01:04:51.600 --> 01:04:54.279
He just sat there

01:04:54.280 --> 01:04:57.040
staring into the darkness.

01:05:00.280 --> 01:05:03.040
The only thing that made him open up...

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:11.040
I could get him to talk, just a little.

01:05:12.520 --> 01:05:14.279
But...

01:05:14.280 --> 01:05:17.840
In return you had to offer him
Sherlock's life story.

01:05:18.840 --> 01:05:21.320
So, one big lie...

01:05:22.320 --> 01:05:24.359
..Sherlock's a fraud,

01:05:24.360 --> 01:05:28.160
and people will swallow it
because the rest of it's true.

01:05:29.160 --> 01:05:32.679
Moriarty wanted Sherlock destroyed, right,

01:05:32.680 --> 01:05:38.040
and you have given him
the perfect ammunition.

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.040
John.

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:50.759
I'm sorry.

01:05:50.760 --> 01:05:52.680
Oh, please!

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.520
Tell him, would you?

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:09.759
I got your message.

01:06:09.760 --> 01:06:13.359
The computer code is the key to
this. We find it, we can use it.

01:06:13.360 --> 01:06:16.279
Use it? He used it to create
a false identity

01:06:16.280 --> 01:06:19.119
so we can break into the records
and destroy Richard Brook.

01:06:19.120 --> 01:06:20.799
Bring back Jim Moriarty again.

01:06:20.800 --> 01:06:21.880
Somewhere in 221b,

01:06:21.881 --> 01:06:24.679
somewhere on the day of the verdict
he left it hidden.

01:06:24.680 --> 01:06:26.040
Uh-huh.

01:06:27.280 --> 01:06:29.919
What did he touch?
An apple, nothing else.

01:06:29.920 --> 01:06:32.640
Did he write anything down?
No.

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.040
Oh.

01:07:24.640 --> 01:07:26.679
Yeah, speaking.

01:07:26.680 --> 01:07:27.959
What?

01:07:27.960 --> 01:07:30.879
What happened? Is she OK?

01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:33.439
Oh, my God! Right, yes, I'm coming.

01:07:33.440 --> 01:07:36.639
What is it? Paramedics.
Mrs Hudson's been shot.

01:07:36.640 --> 01:07:39.919
How? Probably one of the killers
you managed to attract. Jesus!

01:07:39.920 --> 01:07:42.759
She's dying, Sherlock. Let's go.
You go. I'm busy.

01:07:42.760 --> 01:07:45.319
Busy?!
Thinking. I need to think.

01:07:45.320 --> 01:07:47.959
You need to...?
Doesn't she mean anything to you?

01:07:47.960 --> 01:07:50.879
You once half-killed a man
because he laid a finger on her.

01:07:50.880 --> 01:07:54.719
She's my landlady.
She's dying...you machine!

01:07:54.720 --> 01:07:58.039
Sod this. Sod this! You stay here
if you want, on your own.

01:07:58.040 --> 01:08:00.559
Alone is what I have.
Alone protects me.

01:08:00.560 --> 01:08:02.640
No, friends protect people.

01:08:22.040 --> 01:08:24.799
# I've been kicked around since I was born

01:08:24.800 --> 01:08:27.238
# But now it's all right, it's OK

01:08:27.240 --> 01:08:29.279
# You can look the other way

01:08:29.279 --> 01:08:31.479
# We can try to understand

01:08:31.479 --> 01:08:33.999
# The New York Times' effect on man

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.919
# Whether you're a brother
or whether you're a mother

01:08:36.920 --> 01:08:39.038
# You're stayin' alive... #

01:08:39.040 --> 01:08:43.038
Well...here we are at last.

01:08:43.040 --> 01:08:46.158
You and me, Sherlock.

01:08:46.160 --> 01:08:49.679
And our problem - the final problem.

01:08:49.680 --> 01:08:52.760
Staying alive!

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:57.120
It's so boring, isn't it?

01:08:58.319 --> 01:09:01.520
It's just staying.

01:09:02.520 --> 01:09:05.519
All my life I've been searching
for distractions

01:09:05.520 --> 01:09:08.599
and you were the best distraction
and now I don't even have you

01:09:08.600 --> 01:09:10.959
because I've beaten you.

01:09:10.960 --> 01:09:14.040
And you know what?
In the end, it was easy.

01:09:15.439 --> 01:09:17.118
It was easy.

01:09:17.120 --> 01:09:20.399
Now I've got to go back to playing
with the ordinary people,

01:09:20.399 --> 01:09:23.520
and it turns out you're ordinary,
just like all of them.

01:09:24.520 --> 01:09:27.439
Ah, well.

01:09:28.840 --> 01:09:32.679
Did you almost start to wonder
if I was real?

01:09:32.680 --> 01:09:35.359
Did I nearly get you?

01:09:35.359 --> 01:09:37.719
Richard Brook.

01:09:37.720 --> 01:09:41.799
Nobody seems to get the joke, but you do.

01:09:41.800 --> 01:09:43.879
Of course. Attaboy.

01:09:43.880 --> 01:09:46.599
Richard Brook in German is Reichenbach.

01:09:46.600 --> 01:09:50.680
The case that made my name.
Just trying to have some fun.

01:09:55.080 --> 01:09:58.120
Good. You got that too.

01:09:59.560 --> 01:10:02.039
Beats like digits.

01:10:02.040 --> 01:10:06.039
Every beat is a one, every rest is a zero.

01:10:06.040 --> 01:10:07.719
Binary code.

01:10:07.720 --> 01:10:10.559
That's why all those assassins
tried to save my life.

01:10:10.560 --> 01:10:13.239
It was hidden on me, hidden inside my head.

01:10:13.240 --> 01:10:16.679
A few simple lines of computer code
that can break into any system.

01:10:16.680 --> 01:10:21.159
Told all my clients,
last one to Sherlock is a sissy.

01:10:21.160 --> 01:10:26.040
But now that it's up here, I can
use it to alter all the records.

01:10:27.040 --> 01:10:31.000
I can kill Rich Brook
and bring back Jim Moriarty.

01:10:33.120 --> 01:10:36.319
No, no, no, no, no.
This is too easy.

01:10:36.320 --> 01:10:38.239
This is too easy.

01:10:38.240 --> 01:10:41.720
There is no key, doofus!

01:10:44.080 --> 01:10:48.159
Those digits are meaningless.
They're utterly meaningless.

01:10:48.160 --> 01:10:51.759
You don't really think a couple
of lines of computer code

01:10:51.760 --> 01:10:54.439
are going to crash the world
around our ears?

01:10:54.440 --> 01:10:57.119
I'm disappointed in you, ordinary Sherlock.

01:10:57.120 --> 01:11:02.679
But the rhythm... Partita no 1!
Thank you, Johann Sebastian Bach.

01:11:02.680 --> 01:11:04.740
But then how did you...? How did I break

01:11:04.741 --> 01:11:06.799
into the bank, to the Tower, to the prison?

01:11:06.800 --> 01:11:11.040
Daylight robbery! All it takes
is some willing participants.

01:11:16.400 --> 01:11:19.839
I knew you'd fall for it.
That's your weakness.

01:11:19.840 --> 01:11:22.279
You always want everything to be clever.

01:11:22.280 --> 01:11:24.959
Shall we finish the game?
One final act.

01:11:24.960 --> 01:11:28.399
Glad you chose a tall building.
Nice way to do it.

01:11:28.400 --> 01:11:30.440
Do it? Do what?

01:11:33.040 --> 01:11:35.040
Yes, of course.

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:38.559
My suicide.

01:11:38.560 --> 01:11:41.119
Genius detective proved to be a fraud.

01:11:41.120 --> 01:11:43.879
I read it in the paper so it must be true.

01:11:43.880 --> 01:11:46.319
I love newspapers.

01:11:46.320 --> 01:11:48.400
Fairy tales.

01:11:51.440 --> 01:11:54.040
And pretty grim ones too.

01:12:02.160 --> 01:12:06.199
Oh, God, John, you made me jump.
Is everything OK with the police?

01:12:06.200 --> 01:12:08.840
Has Sherlock sorted it all out?

01:12:10.840 --> 01:12:13.360
Oh, my God.

01:12:16.520 --> 01:12:17.720
Taxi!

01:12:19.040 --> 01:12:22.319
Taxi!
No, no, no. Police...sort of!

01:12:22.320 --> 01:12:24.319
Thanks, mate. Thanks a lot!

01:12:24.320 --> 01:12:27.359
I can prove that you created
an entirely false identity.

01:12:27.360 --> 01:12:30.520
Oh, just kill yourself.
It's a lot less effort.

01:12:32.280 --> 01:12:33.879
Go on.

01:12:33.880 --> 01:12:35.319
For me.

01:12:35.320 --> 01:12:38.040
Please!

01:12:42.040 --> 01:12:43.720
You're insane.

01:12:44.720 --> 01:12:47.359
You're just getting that now?
Wo-wo-wo!

01:12:47.360 --> 01:12:49.040
OK.

01:12:50.680 --> 01:12:53.879
Let me give you a little extra incentive.

01:12:53.880 --> 01:12:56.040
Your friends will die if you don't.

01:12:57.040 --> 01:12:58.319
John?

01:12:58.320 --> 01:13:00.520
Not just John. Everyone.

01:13:01.600 --> 01:13:04.439
Mrs Hudson? Everyone.

01:13:04.440 --> 01:13:10.319
Lestrade? Three bullets,
three gunmen, three victims.

01:13:10.320 --> 01:13:12.760
There's no stopping them now...

01:13:14.760 --> 01:13:17.280
..unless my people see you jump.

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:28.439
You can have me arrested,
you can torture me,

01:13:28.440 --> 01:13:31.039
you can do anything you like with me,

01:13:31.040 --> 01:13:34.639
but nothing's going to prevent them
from pulling the trigger.

01:13:34.640 --> 01:13:37.919
Your only three friends in the world
will die unless...

01:13:37.920 --> 01:13:41.040
Unless I kill myself
and complete your story.

01:13:42.040 --> 01:13:44.839
You've got to admit, that's sexier.

01:13:44.840 --> 01:13:49.519
And I die in disgrace. Of course.
That's the point of this.

01:13:49.520 --> 01:13:52.600
Oh. You've got an audience now.

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.040
Off you pop.

01:13:57.040 --> 01:13:58.440
Go on.

01:14:00.520 --> 01:14:02.600
I told you how this ends.

01:14:06.080 --> 01:14:09.759
Your death is the only thing that's
going to call off the killers.

01:14:09.760 --> 01:14:12.040
I'm certainly not going to do it.

01:14:13.040 --> 01:14:16.800
Would you give me one moment, please?

01:14:17.800 --> 01:14:19.920
One moment of privacy.

01:14:20.920 --> 01:14:22.440
Please.

01:14:24.440 --> 01:14:26.320
Of course.

01:14:49.680 --> 01:14:51.759
What?!

01:14:51.760 --> 01:14:53.960
What is it?

01:14:55.040 --> 01:14:58.040
What did I miss?

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.439
You're not going to do it.

01:15:03.440 --> 01:15:05.439
So the killers can be called off,

01:15:05.440 --> 01:15:08.440
then there's a recall code
or a word or a number.

01:15:10.840 --> 01:15:15.359
I don't have to die if I've got you.

01:15:15.360 --> 01:15:17.000
Oh!

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.679
You think you can make me stop the order?

01:15:20.680 --> 01:15:24.039
You think you can make me do that?
Yes.

01:15:24.040 --> 01:15:27.959
So do you. Sherlock, your big
brother and all the King's horses

01:15:27.960 --> 01:15:30.479
couldn't make me do a thing
I didn't want to.

01:15:30.480 --> 01:15:32.840
Yes, but I'm not my brother, remember?

01:15:34.320 --> 01:15:36.039
I am you.

01:15:36.040 --> 01:15:38.239
Prepared to do anything.

01:15:38.240 --> 01:15:40.439
Prepared to burn.

01:15:40.440 --> 01:15:44.119
Prepared to do what ordinary
people won't do.

01:15:44.120 --> 01:15:48.960
You want me to shake hands with you
in hell? I shall not disappoint you.

01:15:49.960 --> 01:15:51.640
Nah.

01:15:52.640 --> 01:15:55.199
You talk big.

01:15:55.200 --> 01:15:57.199
Nah.

01:15:57.200 --> 01:15:59.279
You're ordinary.

01:15:59.280 --> 01:16:02.239
You're ordinary.
You're on the side of the angels.

01:16:02.240 --> 01:16:05.319
Oh, I may be on the side of the angels,

01:16:05.320 --> 01:16:11.040
but don't think for one second
that I am one of them.

01:16:19.280 --> 01:16:20.800
No...

01:16:22.520 --> 01:16:24.520
..you're not.

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.000
I see.

01:16:33.480 --> 01:16:35.799
You're not ordinary.

01:16:35.800 --> 01:16:37.320
No.

01:16:38.520 --> 01:16:40.600
You're me.

01:16:42.320 --> 01:16:44.240
You're me.

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.200
Thank you...

01:16:49.200 --> 01:16:51.240
..Sherlock Holmes.

01:17:00.120 --> 01:17:02.200
Thank you.

01:17:03.200 --> 01:17:05.040
Bless you.

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:13.040
As long as I'm alive, you can save
your friends, you've got a way out.

01:17:14.040 --> 01:17:16.160
Well, good luck with that.

01:17:27.960 --> 01:17:30.040
No.

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:54.880
Yes, sir. Thank you. Bye.

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:40.319
Hello?

01:18:40.320 --> 01:18:42.759
John.
Hey, Sherlock. Are you OK?

01:18:42.760 --> 01:18:46.079
Turn around and walk back
the way you came. I'm coming in.

01:18:46.080 --> 01:18:48.239
Just do as I ask!

01:18:48.240 --> 01:18:49.639
Please.

01:18:49.640 --> 01:18:51.360
Where?

01:18:52.480 --> 01:18:54.559
Stop there.

01:18:54.560 --> 01:18:57.720
Sherlock?
OK, look up. I'm on the rooftop.

01:18:58.720 --> 01:19:01.319
Oh, God.

01:19:01.320 --> 01:19:05.799
I...I can't come down, so we'll
just have to do it like this.

01:19:05.800 --> 01:19:07.999
What's going on?

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:09.960
An apology.

01:19:12.200 --> 01:19:14.039
It's all true.

01:19:14.040 --> 01:19:16.039
What?

01:19:16.040 --> 01:19:21.280
Everything they said about me.
I invented Moriarty.

01:19:27.240 --> 01:19:29.360
Why are you saying this?

01:19:32.240 --> 01:19:34.319
I'm a fake.

01:19:34.320 --> 01:19:37.999
Sherlock...
The newspapers were right all along.

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:41.039
I want you to tell Lestrade,

01:19:41.040 --> 01:19:44.799
I want you to tell Mrs Hudson and Molly.

01:19:44.800 --> 01:19:47.760
In fact, tell anyone who will
listen to you...

01:19:49.760 --> 01:19:53.520
..that I created Moriarty
for my own purposes.

01:19:54.520 --> 01:19:56.119
OK, shut up Sherlock. Shut up.

01:19:56.120 --> 01:19:58.999
The first time we met...
the first time we met,

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:02.519
you knew all about my sister, right?
Nobody could be that clever.

01:20:02.520 --> 01:20:05.400
You could.

01:20:12.320 --> 01:20:14.440
I researched you.

01:20:15.440 --> 01:20:18.639
Before we met, I discovered
everything that I could

01:20:18.640 --> 01:20:20.920
to impress you.

01:20:21.920 --> 01:20:24.639
It's a trick. Just a magic trick.

01:20:24.640 --> 01:20:26.959
No. All right, stop it now.

01:20:26.960 --> 01:20:29.520
No. Stay exactly where you are.

01:20:30.520 --> 01:20:32.440
Don't move. All right.

01:20:34.440 --> 01:20:37.119
Keep your eyes fixed on me.

01:20:37.120 --> 01:20:40.479
Please, will you do this for me?
Do what?

01:20:40.480 --> 01:20:42.160
This phone call, it's...

01:20:43.160 --> 01:20:45.040
..it's my note.

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.840
It's what people do, don't they?

01:20:51.840 --> 01:20:53.680
Leave a note?

01:20:55.160 --> 01:20:57.439
Leave a note when?

01:20:57.440 --> 01:21:00.400
Goodbye, John. No. Don't...

01:21:11.480 --> 01:21:12.960
Sherlock!

01:21:16.560 --> 01:21:17.840
Sherlock.

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:07.320
Sherlock...Sherlock.

01:22:08.680 --> 01:22:12.159
I'm a doctor, let me come through.
Let me come through, please.

01:22:12.160 --> 01:22:14.600
He's my friend. He's my friend...
Please.

01:22:30.400 --> 01:22:32.920
Please, let me just...

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.439
Oh, Jesus!

01:22:41.440 --> 01:22:43.119
No.

01:22:43.120 --> 01:22:44.800
God, no.

01:24:23.920 --> 01:24:26.440
There's stuff that you wanted to say...

01:24:28.440 --> 01:24:31.040
..but didn't say it. Yeah.

01:24:35.640 --> 01:24:37.720
Say it now.

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.320
Sorry, I can't.

01:24:53.880 --> 01:24:58.039
There's all the stuff.
All the science equipment.

01:24:58.040 --> 01:25:01.519
I left it all in boxes.
I don't know what needs doing.

01:25:01.520 --> 01:25:04.040
I thought I'd take it to a school.

01:25:05.040 --> 01:25:10.040
Would you...? I can't go back to
the flat again, not at the moment.

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:14.519
I'm angry.

01:25:14.520 --> 01:25:17.439
It's OK, John.
There's nothing unusual in that.

01:25:17.440 --> 01:25:19.999
That's the way he made everyone feel.

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:23.679
All the marks on my table and the noise,

01:25:23.680 --> 01:25:26.999
firing guns at half past one
in the morning... Yeah.

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:29.399
..bloody specimens in my fridge.

01:25:29.400 --> 01:25:32.519
Imagine, keeping bodies
where there's food. Yes.

01:25:32.520 --> 01:25:36.559
And the fighting! Drove me up
the wall with all his carryings-on.

01:25:36.560 --> 01:25:39.239
Listen, I'm not actually that angry, OK?

01:25:39.240 --> 01:25:43.280
OK. I'll leave you alone to,
you know...

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:55.680
Erm...

01:25:56.680 --> 01:25:58.039
Hmm.

01:25:58.040 --> 01:26:01.040
You...you told me once...

01:26:02.480 --> 01:26:04.399
..that you weren't a hero.

01:26:04.400 --> 01:26:08.199
Erm, there were times I didn't
even think you were human,

01:26:08.200 --> 01:26:11.319
but let me tell you this, you were...

01:26:11.320 --> 01:26:12.999
the best man...

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:17.999
the most human...human being
that I've ever known

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:22.040
and no-one will ever convince me
that you told me a lie, so...

01:26:23.480 --> 01:26:25.240
..there.

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:34.280
I was so alone...

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.040
..and I owe you so much.

01:26:42.520 --> 01:26:46.079
But, please, there's just one
more thing, one more thing,

01:26:46.080 --> 01:26:49.480
one more miracle, Sherlock,
for me, don't be...

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:53.519
..dead.

01:26:53.520 --> 01:26:55.999
Would you do that just for me?

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:58.360
Just stop it. Stop this.

01:28:10.680 --> 01:28:13.360
