01:52.600 --> 01:56.126
Hey, get away from me with that
pail of water. I'll kill you.

02:05.362 --> 02:07.555
Hey, what was the
elbow for, asshole?

02:27.092 --> 02:31.245
Yeah, nice pitch! Get
two, get two, get two!

03:09.594 --> 03:13.221
Cut it out! Daddy, tell
him to leave me alone.

03:13.221 --> 03:16.266
- Peter started it!
- I did not, you liar!

03:16.267 --> 03:17.976
- Did too.
- Did not.

03:17.977 --> 03:20.270
Alright, let's settle
down and stop fighting.

03:20.271 --> 03:22.131
She started it.

03:24.400 --> 03:27.610
That looks neat.
Can I try it, Daddy?

03:27.611 --> 03:30.806
Maybe in a couple years,
if we ever get a motorboat.

03:30.989 --> 03:35.394
Can we go to the camp one summer?
I bet they'd show us there.

03:35.536 --> 03:37.521
Well, I don't know about that.

03:39.249 --> 03:42.318
Hang in there, Dolore!
You're doing great!

03:42.377 --> 03:44.946
Can't we stop now?

03:45.213 --> 03:47.922
Hey, Craig. How about letting
me take her out once, huh?

03:47.923 --> 03:50.133
Come on, Mary Ann.
You know I can't do that.

03:50.134 --> 03:52.802
Oh, don't be such a stiff.
I know how to drive these things.

03:52.803 --> 03:54.889
My old man's got one twice as big.

03:54.890 --> 03:58.059
Yeah, and is your old man gonna
give me a job when I get fired?

03:58.060 --> 04:01.838
Lighten up, will you? No one's
gonna see us way out here.

04:18.789 --> 04:23.609
Oh, so you think it's funny,
huh? You little schemers!

04:25.212 --> 04:28.323
Come on. Please?

04:29.257 --> 04:30.633
Alright.

04:30.634 --> 04:31.701
Super!

04:31.885 --> 04:33.661
But look, just for a minute.

04:38.433 --> 04:39.877
Not too fast!

04:43.188 --> 04:45.465
Hey John, we gotta go meet the Doc.

04:45.982 --> 04:51.263
John! It's almost 4:30.
Doc's gonna be here soon!

04:53.741 --> 04:56.535
Come on, fellas. Doctor
Thomas is on her way up.

04:56.536 --> 04:59.996
- Aunt Martha's coming?
- Is Ricky coming too?

04:59.997 --> 05:02.677
Nah, I'm afraid he's spending
the weekend with his father.

05:04.835 --> 05:09.532
You look like a skiing hunchback!
Straighten up, will ya?

05:15.596 --> 05:17.682
Turn! Turn the boat!

05:17.683 --> 05:19.933
- What'd she say?
- I don't know.

05:19.934 --> 05:21.627
Hey!

05:25.940 --> 05:28.191
There's a boat!

05:28.192 --> 05:31.111
Stop the motor. Holy shit! Turn it!

05:31.112 --> 05:32.681
Turn the wheel!

05:33.406 --> 05:37.060
- I can't turn it!
- Give me the wheel!

05:39.245 --> 05:40.495
John!

05:40.496 --> 05:43.248
Oh my God!

05:43.249 --> 05:48.129
Somebody help those people!
Get in the water!

05:48.130 --> 05:53.676
Get them onto the boat, please!
Oh my God, we just hit them both.

05:53.677 --> 05:56.512
Oh my God.

05:56.513 --> 06:00.348
Somebody help them. Please.

06:00.349 --> 06:08.008
Help them! Please! They're
gonna die, I know it! Please!

06:08.233 --> 06:12.262
Hurry! Help them! Please help them!

06:12.613 --> 06:16.683
Oh my God, we just hit them both.

06:24.751 --> 06:29.529
Hurry, sweeties. We don't
want to be late for the bus.

06:29.672 --> 06:32.866
Goodness, no.
That wouldn't do at all.

06:33.383 --> 06:40.040
Richard. Angela. Oh, here you are.

06:41.016 --> 06:45.103
Look what I did. I packed you
and your cousin some goodies

06:45.104 --> 06:49.424
for the ride up to camp.
Wasn't that nice of me, hmm?

06:50.109 --> 06:51.360
Any Chips?

06:51.361 --> 06:55.889
Why, of course. I believe
there's a whole bag.

06:57.283 --> 06:59.184
I'm almost sure of it.

06:59.953 --> 07:07.042
Angela, isn't there anything special
my little girl would care for, hmm?

07:07.044 --> 07:09.044
We gotta go, mom.
It's getting late.

07:09.045 --> 07:12.673
Well of course you do, dear. We
wouldn't want them to leave without us,

07:12.674 --> 07:14.115
now would we?

07:14.884 --> 07:17.787
No. No, I'm afraid
that that wouldn't do.

07:18.721 --> 07:23.543
Come, children. Let's
be on our way.

07:28.940 --> 07:30.300
Now what?

07:30.860 --> 07:35.721
I believe that I've forgotten
something. Now, what can it be?

07:37.283 --> 07:40.951
Oh, I remember what it is.
I knew I would forget.

07:40.952 --> 07:44.982
I just kept reminding myself.
In fact, I tied a string around...

07:46.083 --> 07:50.403
Around my finger,
so I wouldn't forget.

07:50.504 --> 07:51.837
See?

07:51.838 --> 07:56.034
And I didn't. You never
can be too careful.

08:02.308 --> 08:04.042
Well, what is it already?

08:06.604 --> 08:11.008
Oh, just a moment!
I'll be right back!

08:12.400 --> 08:14.386
Good old Mom's at it again.

08:14.445 --> 08:18.489
Here they are! All filled out
and signed by yours truly.

08:18.490 --> 08:20.867
Wasn't that nice of me, hmm?

08:20.868 --> 08:23.828
- What are they?
- Why, they're your physicals, of course.

08:23.829 --> 08:26.774
We can't go to camp without
our physicals, now can we?

08:27.083 --> 08:30.235
Just be careful not to tell
anyone how you got them.

08:30.753 --> 08:34.239
Oh, no, I'm afraid that they
wouldn't approve of that at all.

08:35.174 --> 08:37.717
Even though they know
that I am a doctor.

08:37.717 --> 08:40.038
No matter what they
do, I'll never tell.

08:40.096 --> 08:43.916
Oh, you're such a dear.

08:45.560 --> 08:47.477
Well, run along now.

08:47.478 --> 08:51.230
- So long, Mom.
- Goodbye, my angel.

08:51.231 --> 08:56.303
I hope you have a good time.
But of course you will.

08:56.613 --> 08:59.349
Take good care of my
little girl, Richard!

08:59.616 --> 09:03.770
- Goodbye, Mom.
- Goodbye, dear.

10:03.097 --> 10:08.752
Look at all that young, fresh chicken.
Where I come from we call them baldies.

10:09.478 --> 10:11.463
Makes your mouth water, don't it?

10:11.605 --> 10:16.318
Artie. They're too young to even
understand what's on your mind.

10:16.319 --> 10:19.430
Ben, good buddy, there ain't any
such thing as being too young.

10:20.115 --> 10:21.765
You're just too old.

10:40.885 --> 10:43.137
Ahh! Ricky, how you doin'?

10:43.138 --> 10:45.306
- Paul, great to see you.
- You winning?

10:45.307 --> 10:47.458
Ah, you know. Same old shit.

10:47.517 --> 10:50.169
- Hey, this is my cousin Angela.
- How you doin'?

10:52.272 --> 10:55.608
She's kind of shy, I guess. You know,
first time away from home and all.

10:55.609 --> 10:58.486
Listen, I got to take her down to the
bunks. I'll catch you down the hill, ok?

10:58.487 --> 10:59.637
You got it.

11:03.407 --> 11:04.601
Hey, Rick.

11:04.992 --> 11:07.061
Wait'll you get a load of Judy!

11:07.120 --> 11:08.829
Man, oh, man.

11:08.830 --> 11:10.372
Oh, yeah?

11:10.373 --> 11:11.692
You'll see.

11:13.001 --> 11:15.878
Me and Judy were steadies last summer.

11:15.879 --> 11:17.959
Hey, you'll probably be in the same cabin.

11:28.726 --> 11:30.351
These are all the girls' cabins.

11:30.352 --> 11:33.939
Over there is the rec hall.
Next to that is Ronnie's shack.

11:33.940 --> 11:37.383
Behind that's the archery
range. There she is!

11:37.484 --> 11:41.430
Judy! Yo, Judy! How you doin'?

11:41.696 --> 11:42.905
Alright.

11:42.906 --> 11:45.099
Who's the wimp?

11:45.284 --> 11:46.910
Oh, that's Ricky.

11:46.911 --> 11:48.829
Wasn't he the kid you were
babysitting last year?

11:48.830 --> 11:51.315
Guess I'm not good
enough for her anymore.

11:57.129 --> 11:58.672
Well, here you go, Angela.

11:58.673 --> 12:00.757
If you need anything,
I'll be in bunk 19, below.

12:00.758 --> 12:02.117
Second from the bottom.

12:09.225 --> 12:12.018
- Who were those guys?
- Just some boys I met today.

12:12.019 --> 12:14.046
Weren't they a little old for you?

12:14.480 --> 12:16.438
Don't you know girls
mature before boys?

12:16.439 --> 12:18.191
That's bullshit and you know it.

12:18.192 --> 12:21.136
Ricky, I don't have time for
your nonsense right now.

12:22.698 --> 12:26.017
Well, excuse me. Bitch.

12:36.420 --> 12:40.298
Alright, ladies. Let's
hurry it up and unpack

12:40.299 --> 12:41.615
so we can get these trunks
the hell out of here.

12:41.799 --> 12:45.261
By the way, for those of you who
don't know, the name is Meg.

12:45.262 --> 12:47.414
M-E-G.

12:48.557 --> 12:52.435
This here is Susie. You got any problems,
this is the complaint department.

12:52.436 --> 12:54.336
Got it? Ok? Capische?

13:04.489 --> 13:06.308
What are you looking at?

13:16.126 --> 13:18.486
What, are you taking
pictures? Quit it!

13:19.171 --> 13:23.325
You must be Angela. Remember?
Ronnie spoke to us about her.

13:24.177 --> 13:26.621
Looks like we got a real winner here.

13:26.971 --> 13:29.331
You ain't kidding.

13:41.109 --> 13:43.386
Quiet, please.

13:46.074 --> 13:48.767
Thanks for nothing.

13:49.952 --> 13:53.146
Quiet, please.

14:05.843 --> 14:08.495
See what I mean, Ronnie?
She hasn't even touched it.

14:10.139 --> 14:12.933
Angela, Meg tells me you haven't
eaten much since you've been here.

14:12.934 --> 14:13.809
Is that true?

14:13.810 --> 14:17.421
You won't get a peep out of this one.
She hasn't said a word in three days.

14:18.148 --> 14:21.233
Tell you what. How about if you and
me take a walk into the kitchen?

14:21.234 --> 14:24.262
See if we can find something
you like. That sound okay?

14:25.822 --> 14:28.073
I'm gonna take her inside to
see Artie. She'll be alright.

14:28.074 --> 14:30.351
Probably a little homesick, is all.

14:30.493 --> 14:31.602
Come on, Angela.

14:37.250 --> 14:40.445
He's starting to spoil
the little brat already.

14:46.050 --> 14:50.580
Hey Ben, is Artie around? Artie,
can I see you for a minute, please?

14:52.433 --> 14:55.460
Hey, Artie. Be a little more
discrete with the beer can, huh?

14:55.602 --> 14:57.854
Sure, Ron. What's up?

14:57.855 --> 15:01.509
I want you to meet one of our new campers.
Angela, this is Artie, our head chef.

15:02.984 --> 15:05.302
Well, hello there, Angela.

15:06.279 --> 15:07.931
Can you get that, Ben? Please?

15:09.115 --> 15:11.184
As you can see, she
isn't very talkative.

15:11.369 --> 15:13.995
In fact, she isn't much of a
fan of your cooking, either.

15:13.996 --> 15:16.874
You think you could find something
for her? Some ice cream, or, you know...

15:16.875 --> 15:18.458
Phone for you and Mel, Ron.

15:18.459 --> 15:20.461
Do me a favor. Get Mel, will you?

15:20.462 --> 15:22.587
See what you can do, okay,
Artie? I'll catch you later.

15:22.588 --> 15:25.031
No problem. I'll find
something she likes.

15:25.424 --> 15:28.201
I'll bet we can find something
interesting in the walk-in.

15:28.844 --> 15:31.372
You never know what you
can find in there.

15:38.772 --> 15:40.005
Where's my cousin?

15:40.105 --> 15:41.648
Ronnie took her into the kitchen.

15:41.649 --> 15:44.217
- She eat anything?
- What do you think?

15:44.276 --> 15:48.071
What's her problem, anyway? She don't eat,
she don't talk, she don't do anything.

15:48.072 --> 15:50.767
Why don't you leave her
alone? She's just quiet.

15:53.078 --> 15:55.772
If she were any quieter,
she'd be dead.

16:01.669 --> 16:04.363
So Angela, see anything you like?

16:06.216 --> 16:07.784
Maybe I can help you decide.

16:10.512 --> 16:13.414
You sure are a sweet-looking
little cupcake, ain't you?

16:16.560 --> 16:20.671
Yeah. Think I got something
you're gonna like real good.

16:25.276 --> 16:26.677
Hey, what are you doing?!

16:27.988 --> 16:29.114
Keep your mouth shut, you hear me?

16:29.115 --> 16:31.366
You didn't see nothin'!
Got it? Nothin'!

16:31.367 --> 16:34.048
- Sure. Whatever you want.
- Now get the hell out of here.

16:38.915 --> 16:41.442
Hey, What's going on?

16:42.544 --> 16:44.153
What was that all about?

16:46.132 --> 16:47.950
Guess I scared him.

16:51.637 --> 16:53.330
I guess so.

17:00.938 --> 17:03.773
Want to check on the water?
About done over here.

17:03.774 --> 17:07.051
That damn water better be done.
It's been on a half hour. Shit!

17:07.945 --> 17:12.016
- Gimme that goddamn chair.
- All yours, my good man.

17:16.369 --> 17:18.290
It's still got a couple minutes to go.

17:18.455 --> 17:20.957
Gonna grab some hay
before dinner. You coming?

17:20.958 --> 17:24.111
- Yeah, after I throw the corn in.
- See you later.

18:10.424 --> 18:12.117
Boiling yet?

18:13.011 --> 18:14.913
Atta girl.

18:37.869 --> 18:39.788
Motherfucker, you
could have killed me!

18:39.789 --> 18:41.982
Now get the hell over
here and help me down.

18:43.793 --> 18:44.985
Come on, kid.

18:45.461 --> 18:48.738
Get me down and I'll make you a
nice ice cream sundae, okay?

18:51.342 --> 18:53.577
Hey, what the... What
the hell you doin'?!

18:53.927 --> 18:55.470
You little shit!

18:55.471 --> 18:57.806
When I get down from here I'm
gonna rip your fucking head off!

18:57.807 --> 19:00.085
Ben! Help! Ben!

19:00.560 --> 19:03.603
Ben! Get the hell in here! Ben!

19:03.604 --> 19:06.898
Help! Ben! Ben!

19:06.899 --> 19:08.092
Ben!

20:06.084 --> 20:10.254
I'm afraid I don't carry a
sedative strong enough to mask

20:10.255 --> 20:14.216
the kind of agony he's in right now. Every
nerve in his body must feel like it's on fire.

20:14.217 --> 20:18.789
- What's the prognosis, Doc?
- Well, he's badly burned all over.

20:18.806 --> 20:20.140
Especially his face.

20:20.141 --> 20:21.709
How about his eyes?

20:22.559 --> 20:24.769
Too early to tell.

20:24.770 --> 20:28.214
- Jesus, the pain must be incredible.
- Poor guy must be going crazy.

20:28.732 --> 20:29.733
Yeah, if he's lucky.

20:29.734 --> 20:35.973
Look, can we move this along, please?
No need to upset the campers, right?

20:37.324 --> 20:39.060
Well, I guess I'll be on my way.

20:40.869 --> 20:42.078
Now what?

20:42.079 --> 20:45.373
Now we get this ambulance out
of here as quickly as we can.

20:45.374 --> 20:47.124
Why? It was only an accident.

20:47.125 --> 20:50.587
Because I don't want the kids or their
parents to know that this ever happened.

20:50.588 --> 20:51.864
You understand?

20:51.964 --> 20:53.157
What about them?

20:54.008 --> 20:55.326
Don't worry.

20:55.802 --> 20:57.287
I'll take care of them.

21:02.767 --> 21:04.847
Real shame what happened to Artie in here.

21:05.269 --> 21:08.173
In the future, I hope the rest
of you will be more careful.

21:09.732 --> 21:10.841
Ben?

21:12.111 --> 21:15.514
I guess that makes you the
head man here now, doesn't it?

21:15.655 --> 21:18.724
I wasn't thinking much
about myself, Mr. Costa.

21:19.534 --> 21:22.244
I just don't see how something
like that could happen.

21:22.245 --> 21:25.206
Come on now, Ben. We still got a
camp to feed here now, don't we?

21:25.207 --> 21:26.374
Yes, sir.

21:26.375 --> 21:31.045
Besides, fifty bucks more a week
can't be all that bad, now, can it?

21:31.046 --> 21:36.634
No, sir. I always thought he
had a little devil in him.

21:36.635 --> 21:40.538
And fifteen dollars a week
more for the rest of you, eh?

21:41.097 --> 21:44.000
- That's real generous of you, sir.
- Well, now...

21:44.727 --> 21:47.838
Ben, there is one thing, though...

21:51.650 --> 21:55.513
There's really no reason for the
campers to find out what happened.

21:55.613 --> 22:02.160
You know what I mean?
Too, um, gruesome, I think.

22:02.161 --> 22:07.107
So why don't we just say that Artie found himself
another job, should anybody happen to ask.

22:08.375 --> 22:10.793
Sure, sure. Whatever you say, sir.

22:10.794 --> 22:14.657
Good, and do me a favor. Tell your
friends here to say the same thing.

22:14.674 --> 22:16.215
You don't have to worry
none about them.

22:16.216 --> 22:19.828
Good. Thanks, Ben. I knew
I could count on you.

22:21.680 --> 22:25.083
- What do you say we get dinner going here, huh?
- Right away, sir.

22:31.524 --> 22:34.009
Mind over matter is the key.

22:34.193 --> 22:38.571
Mind over matter says that even the
incredibly simple task of a single sit-up

22:38.572 --> 22:41.532
should be impossible,
should the mind will it.

22:41.533 --> 22:44.228
Come on. There's no way.

22:44.662 --> 22:46.898
Shut up, Mozart, and concentrate.

22:48.041 --> 22:51.612
Concentrate on summoning all your
strength for this single sit-up.

22:51.711 --> 22:54.838
And you will be amazed when the
time comes that although the body

22:54.839 --> 22:58.617
is willing, the mind refuses.

23:00.094 --> 23:05.140
I will count to three. On three, you will
concentrate all your strength, only to

23:05.141 --> 23:09.061
see the folly of it all. Concentrate,
dear boy. I cannot stress this enough.

23:09.062 --> 23:11.755
Mind over matter. Mind over matter.

23:12.941 --> 23:15.009
I shall now begin the count.

23:17.111 --> 23:18.179
One.

23:19.155 --> 23:20.348
Two.

23:21.283 --> 23:22.600
Three!

23:23.619 --> 23:25.354
You guys are gross!

23:27.915 --> 23:30.916
Don't tell me Mozart fell for
the old mind over matter trick.

23:30.917 --> 23:32.918
Oh, not Mozart.
He's too swift for that.

23:32.919 --> 23:35.572
Hey, listen. Everybody grab
your glove. The games are on.

23:35.589 --> 23:37.924
- They're gonna play us?
- Right now.

23:37.925 --> 23:40.677
I got five bucks riding on
you guys, so don't lose.

23:40.678 --> 23:42.804
No sweat, Gene. We're
gonna kick their asses.

23:42.805 --> 23:45.207
Alright, you better. Let's go.

23:48.228 --> 23:51.089
Come on, Ricky, babe.
Save me my ups.

23:51.090 --> 23:52.428
Hey! Big man!

23:52.454 --> 23:55.909
You and your boys want to place a little
wager while the game is still close?

23:55.985 --> 23:57.694
What do you have in mind, asswipe?

23:57.695 --> 24:00.722
- Buck a man, asshole!
- That's a little steep.

24:01.073 --> 24:03.601
- Make it five.
- You got it.

24:10.666 --> 24:12.266
Come on, Chuck, he's a looker.

24:12.585 --> 24:15.655
Nice shot, Rick, way to go!

24:25.557 --> 24:27.141
Go Paul! Come on, Paul.

24:27.142 --> 24:29.100
Make yourself useful and
bring me home, huh?

24:29.101 --> 24:32.088
This little shit, will be
lucky to make contact.

24:32.521 --> 24:34.322
Should've brought my rabbit's foot.

24:38.320 --> 24:40.404
You got it, you got it, you got it!

24:40.405 --> 24:43.100
You got it! Come on!
Get it! Get it!

24:50.039 --> 24:53.318
Safe!

24:56.463 --> 24:59.158
- Nice shot, man.
- Must have been lucky.

25:01.218 --> 25:05.971
Come on, Billy, be a hitter Bill.
Come on, Bill!

25:05.972 --> 25:09.808
No problem Geno, this guy blows
dead dogs. Just lay it in there.

25:09.809 --> 25:13.228
- Eat shit and die, Ricky!
- Eat shit and live, Bill.

25:13.229 --> 25:17.468
Yea Bill, he's a little wimp, Bill.

25:18.319 --> 25:20.928
Come on, keep your eye on it.
Drive it in. Let's go.

25:23.615 --> 25:25.683
Right there, Bill!
Go ahead. Go! Go! Go!

25:27.078 --> 25:29.161
Wake up Mo!

25:29.162 --> 25:30.871
Shit.

25:30.872 --> 25:32.040
Come on, Mo!

25:32.041 --> 25:34.192
You got it, babe!

25:39.507 --> 25:41.741
Nice catch, Motz.

25:41.800 --> 25:43.202
Get off, man.

25:43.761 --> 25:47.597
Can you believe that? Hey, how
many we up by now, anyway?

25:47.598 --> 25:50.292
I think it's 8-6.

25:57.692 --> 25:59.735
Come on. Take the bat
off your shoulder.

25:59.736 --> 26:00.928
Fuck you!

26:01.320 --> 26:04.139
You tell him too, Rick.
You tell him, too.

26:18.338 --> 26:20.755
What are you gonna do
with your big paycheck?

26:20.756 --> 26:23.676
I don't know! Maybe I'll get
a Corvette or something.

26:23.677 --> 26:24.634
How about you?

26:24.635 --> 26:26.761
I think I'll take a cruise.

26:26.762 --> 26:29.681
Hey, Mr. G! How about some
real competition next time?

26:29.682 --> 26:33.670
Yeah! Maybe the girls want a game!

26:36.398 --> 26:38.857
It's okay, we'll get 'em back.
Come on, we'll get 'em back.

26:38.858 --> 26:40.676
Don't worry. We'll get 'em back.

26:57.001 --> 26:58.878
We still need more babes.

26:58.879 --> 27:03.032
I mean, who wants to go skinny dipping
with fifteen guys and only five girls?

27:03.258 --> 27:04.926
Hey, let's ask Angela.

27:04.927 --> 27:09.848
Man, I've been watching her a
whole week, and she is fucked up.

27:09.849 --> 27:15.295
Now wait a second. You guys aren't
afraid to ask Angela, are you?

27:16.271 --> 27:18.814
I think it might be kind of interesting
if Angela were around tonight.

27:18.815 --> 27:20.508
Good. Then you ask her.

27:20.902 --> 27:24.028
Oh, I would, but it wasn't my idea.

27:24.029 --> 27:27.475
Hey, and who am I to steal
a buddy's great idea, huh?

27:27.908 --> 27:31.061
Unless, of course,
you guys are... chicken!

27:34.373 --> 27:36.441
Alright! Alright, we'll do it!

27:37.460 --> 27:39.944
Who knows? We may get
married one day.

27:44.509 --> 27:46.160
Nice shot.

27:46.928 --> 27:50.347
Say, Angela. We're all going
down to the lake tonight.

27:50.348 --> 27:56.103
You know, for a little swim. And, um,
we were kind of wondering if, well,

27:56.104 --> 27:58.224
maybe if you wanted to
join us or something.

28:00.358 --> 28:01.842
Let the pro take over.

28:04.822 --> 28:10.936
Listen Angela, what say me and you go for a
little walk somewhere, talk about tonight, huh?

28:13.329 --> 28:15.163
What's the matter, can't you talk?

28:15.164 --> 28:18.542
I told you she was playing with
half a deck. Angela's a nut cake.

28:18.543 --> 28:21.404
Ain't that right, Angela?
Ain't you Looney Tunes?

28:41.984 --> 28:45.513
Hey Angela, how's this? Remind
you of anyone you know?

28:45.696 --> 28:48.239
Yo, Angela. How come
you're so fucked up?

28:48.240 --> 28:49.656
I mean, like, what's your problem?

28:49.657 --> 28:51.491
Hey, dickface, leave her alone.

28:51.492 --> 28:54.479
Oh yeah? What are you gonna
do about it, asshole?

29:11.346 --> 29:14.223
You fucks! I'm gonna beat
your fucking asses in!

29:14.224 --> 29:15.558
You and what army?

29:15.559 --> 29:17.168
Oh, shut up and let's go.

29:17.227 --> 29:18.461
Come on.

29:20.063 --> 29:20.981
Pricks!

29:20.982 --> 29:22.441
Shut your mouth,
will you, Mel's here?

29:22.442 --> 29:23.901
I don't give a shit.

29:23.902 --> 29:26.236
I think I'd better take you over to the
infirmary before your mouth gets you

29:26.237 --> 29:27.570
into any more trouble.

29:27.571 --> 29:30.281
- You alright?
- Yeah, I guess so.

29:30.282 --> 29:32.451
Don't worry about it, Rick.
We'll get 'em back.

29:32.452 --> 29:34.645
Come on, let's get out of here.

29:46.298 --> 29:49.675
Hi. I'm Paul. Remember?

29:49.676 --> 29:52.079
I met you last week when
we all first got here.

29:53.514 --> 29:58.629
Listen, I heard... Well, I mean,
Ricky told me all about it.

30:00.146 --> 30:03.592
Well anyway, I'm really sorry about
what happened to your family.

30:04.651 --> 30:07.194
Me and Ricky, we go
back a long time.

30:07.195 --> 30:09.475
We've been best friends
for three years already.

30:10.323 --> 30:12.444
We always seem to get
into trouble together.

30:13.159 --> 30:15.978
Last year we hung the girls'
panties on the flagpole.

30:19.457 --> 30:20.609
Sorry.

30:21.919 --> 30:23.570
We got caught anyway.

30:24.254 --> 30:25.821
Could be a lot of rocks.

30:29.551 --> 30:30.744
Jerk.

30:32.304 --> 30:34.288
Then there was this
time last year...

30:34.807 --> 30:38.251
We locked Alan Weinstein out of
the cabin with no clothes on.

30:38.519 --> 30:40.199
Boy, did we get it for that one.

30:42.731 --> 30:47.468
Hey, bunk 19, time to go. Say
your goodnights and move out.

30:47.778 --> 30:51.391
Guess I gotta go. Well,
goodnight, Angela.

30:56.413 --> 30:57.896
Goodnight.

31:01.125 --> 31:02.651
Good night!

31:18.018 --> 31:20.002
Come on, girls!

31:20.769 --> 31:23.840
Water's really warm at night.
What do you say, huh?

31:23.940 --> 31:27.135
- I don't know, Billy.
- It's all very simple, right?

31:28.110 --> 31:29.777
Why don't you start without us?

31:29.778 --> 31:31.196
The hell with you, then!

31:31.197 --> 31:33.599
You don't know how to
have any fun anyways.

31:34.075 --> 31:35.394
Come on, boys.

31:39.538 --> 31:43.818
- Come on, be serious.
- I am serious.

31:43.877 --> 31:45.445
Woo!

31:50.259 --> 31:51.800
Whoa!

31:51.801 --> 31:52.910
Oh!

32:07.609 --> 32:10.171
Any of you ladies interested
in a moonlight canoe ride?

32:10.863 --> 32:13.599
Hey, come on. I won't try
anything, I promise.

32:14.492 --> 32:15.976
How about it, Betsy?

32:16.534 --> 32:18.728
No, I don't think so, Kenny.

32:18.787 --> 32:21.205
Leslie's coming down soon.
Why don't you ask her?

32:21.206 --> 32:23.608
Leslie's coming down?

32:25.210 --> 32:26.986
Definitely, definitely.

32:27.671 --> 32:28.989
Take it easy.

32:32.802 --> 32:34.871
Have a good trip.

32:35.388 --> 32:38.791
I don't like the way he said that.
Are you two planning something?

32:38.973 --> 32:43.128
Relax, Leslie. You can trust me. Mike's
always screwing around like that.

32:57.618 --> 32:59.812
The water really does
feel warmer at night.

33:00.246 --> 33:02.080
Better not leave your
hand in there too long.

33:02.081 --> 33:04.984
All the water snakes and snapping
turtles come out at night.

33:05.627 --> 33:06.459
Yeah, sure.

33:06.460 --> 33:09.697
Really! If you fall in,
you're gonna get eaten alive.

33:09.797 --> 33:11.715
Hey, quit rockin' it, will you?

33:11.716 --> 33:14.343
Why? You're not scared of a few
snakes and turtles, are you?

33:14.344 --> 33:17.096
Kenny, stop it! I want to go back.

33:17.097 --> 33:22.293
You know, if we fall in, we
may never be seen again!

33:22.853 --> 33:25.171
You bastard! I hate you.

33:31.446 --> 33:34.347
Hey, that's not a water snake
I see over there, is it?

33:45.959 --> 33:48.669
Leslie...

33:48.670 --> 33:51.281
Les-lie...

33:52.173 --> 33:53.339
Hey!

33:53.340 --> 33:54.659
Hey, you!

33:57.512 --> 33:59.622
You guys are real schmucks.

34:04.604 --> 34:07.981
Hey, Leslie! See any
water snakes out there?

34:07.982 --> 34:10.800
Woooo!

34:11.234 --> 34:15.737
Hey, Bob-a-Ray-Bob.
Hey, hey, Bob-a-Ray-Bob.

34:15.739 --> 34:19.351
What the hell are you doing here?

34:20.286 --> 34:23.147
I bet the rest of the boys'll
be interested in seeing you.

34:27.293 --> 34:29.627
Hey, Kenny! You scared
all the chicks away!

34:29.629 --> 34:30.710
That's Kenny.

34:30.712 --> 34:32.713
Love him and leave him.

34:32.714 --> 34:35.425
Hey, we better beat it before all those
girls get caught and tell Ronnie we're

34:35.426 --> 34:36.534
all down here.

34:36.677 --> 34:38.844
Is this what's called getting
caught with your pants down?

34:38.846 --> 34:42.750
Aw, you stupid shit.

34:43.726 --> 34:45.253
Woo!

34:47.813 --> 34:49.422
Kenny, let's go!

34:51.900 --> 34:53.652
Come on, we're out of here!

34:53.652 --> 34:55.987
Fuck him, Mike! He's
being a wise-ass again!

34:55.987 --> 34:57.710
We'll catch him back at the bunk.

35:12.380 --> 35:14.924
Why do I have to clean up after
these little peckerheads?

35:14.925 --> 35:17.160
It's not my camp.

35:17.636 --> 35:19.916
You'd think I didn't have
anything better to do!

35:21.765 --> 35:23.917
These peckerheads suck!

35:26.395 --> 35:28.505
How the hell did that get there?

35:32.275 --> 35:36.320
Pick up this. Pick up that.
Clean this. Clean that.

35:36.321 --> 35:38.306
Sign here, Mel.

35:39.074 --> 35:42.535
I'd like to see Mel get his fat ass
down here and pick up something.

35:42.536 --> 35:44.020
That cheap son of a...

36:08.270 --> 36:10.463
As far as I can tell,
the boy drowned.

36:10.898 --> 36:13.817
Of course, we'll have to wait for the
medical examiner to check him over

36:13.818 --> 36:14.609
before we can be certain.

36:14.610 --> 36:18.030
Of course he drowned. He was horsing
around, the canoe tipped over.

36:18.031 --> 36:19.656
He must have hit his head.

36:19.657 --> 36:22.451
I don't think so. Weren't any
bumps or bruises when I checked.

36:22.452 --> 36:24.452
Though again, I'm no
expert on this matter.

36:24.453 --> 36:28.331
It was obviously an accident. I mean, the
boy might have gotten scared and panicked.

36:28.332 --> 36:29.357
Right?

36:29.416 --> 36:31.042
That could be a logical explanation.

36:31.043 --> 36:33.880
So it was one of those fluke accidents
we could not have foreseen,

36:33.881 --> 36:35.422
and that is all there is to it!

36:35.423 --> 36:37.624
- I don't know Mel, I...
- It was an accident!

36:39.218 --> 36:42.304
I mean, that's what the
officer said, right?

36:42.305 --> 36:44.831
I said the autopsy will
be more conclusive.

36:44.932 --> 36:45.849
Right.

36:45.850 --> 36:48.610
- You'll call me as soon as you know?
- You can count on it.

36:48.686 --> 36:52.939
If you'll excuse me I have the unpleasant
task of informing the boy's parents.

36:52.940 --> 36:54.926
Thank you for your help, officer.

36:58.405 --> 37:00.681
The man doesn't take no
for an answer, does he?

37:00.698 --> 37:02.866
I guess he's just uptight
about bad publicity.

37:02.867 --> 37:04.852
Yeah, I guess so.

37:09.750 --> 37:12.960
Hey, weren't you about to say something
just before he bit your head off?

37:12.961 --> 37:17.115
I dunno. I was just thinking, I remember
that boy being a pretty damn good swimmer.

37:20.678 --> 37:22.287
I sure hope you're wrong.

37:25.099 --> 37:27.558
Alright, let's go. Everyone
back to their bunks.

37:27.559 --> 37:30.039
Be ready for the morning
activity. Come on, let's go.

37:35.859 --> 37:37.468
Nine, six.

37:38.111 --> 37:40.430
Get it. Yeah!

37:44.368 --> 37:46.061
Ten, six.

37:48.038 --> 37:49.664
Hi-ya, Angela.

37:49.665 --> 37:52.959
- How's it going?
- Okay. How's it going with you?

37:52.960 --> 37:56.696
Could be better. Your cousin
just whipped me in tennis.

37:57.881 --> 37:59.574
I was wondering...

38:00.551 --> 38:02.831
Want to go to the movie
in the rec hall tonight?

38:03.555 --> 38:05.764
I thought we had to go anyway.

38:05.765 --> 38:09.210
Yeah, we do. But I meant
seeing it together.

38:13.022 --> 38:15.757
So how about it? You want to go?

38:16.066 --> 38:18.301
- Alright.
- Great!

38:18.319 --> 38:23.099
Hey. How come Angela gets to
talk to the boys all day?

38:23.283 --> 38:25.476
And we have to play volleyball.

38:26.411 --> 38:28.688
What's she? Special?

38:30.290 --> 38:32.316
It doesn't seem fair, does it?

38:38.630 --> 38:41.534
- Aren't you supposed to be somewhere?
- I'm going.

38:41.843 --> 38:44.094
- See you later, Angela.
- Bye.

38:44.095 --> 38:45.179
Listen, Angela.

38:45.180 --> 38:48.390
If you're not gonna participate
in our activities,

38:48.391 --> 38:50.226
then you just sit
there and do nothing.

38:50.227 --> 38:53.004
That does not include
talking with the boys.

38:53.062 --> 38:55.397
You're not a goddamn
prima donna, you know?

38:55.398 --> 38:57.400
Understand?

38:57.401 --> 39:01.695
Big deal, she was talking to a boy.
Let's just finish the game

39:01.696 --> 39:03.280
so we can get ready for lunch.

39:03.281 --> 39:04.516
Yeah, let's.

39:07.036 --> 39:09.980
- Are you sure you don't want to play?
- I'm sure.

39:10.580 --> 39:14.484
Is there anything you would like
to do? Go sailing or something?

39:15.251 --> 39:18.322
That's okay. I don't mind watching.

39:21.801 --> 39:24.287
Twelve, seven.

39:43.114 --> 39:45.031
Mind if I walk you
back to your bunk?

39:45.032 --> 39:46.309
I guess not.

39:49.370 --> 39:52.731
Gimme a break, will you?
Stop acting so stuck-up.

39:53.666 --> 39:56.360
Remember all those good
times we had last summer?

39:57.379 --> 39:59.588
What do you say, huh?
Let me walk you back?

39:59.589 --> 40:01.615
Not tonight, Ricky.

40:08.430 --> 40:10.910
- Where are we going?
- I want to show you something.

40:19.609 --> 40:21.344
I hope you're not mad I did that.

40:21.611 --> 40:24.781
I'm not mad. I better go in.

40:24.782 --> 40:26.181
Can I have another one?

40:27.534 --> 40:29.310
You know, another good night kiss?

40:33.790 --> 40:35.483
I have to go now.

40:39.796 --> 40:41.114
Good night, Angela.

40:41.756 --> 40:42.908
Good night.

40:47.929 --> 40:48.888
Hello, Paul.

40:48.889 --> 40:50.164
How you doing, Judy?

40:50.432 --> 40:53.251
You and Angela sure are
becoming quite an item.

40:53.436 --> 40:54.669
So what?

40:54.811 --> 40:56.839
I just didn't think
she was your type.

40:57.063 --> 40:59.691
You know what I mean?

40:59.692 --> 41:01.051
I gotta go.

41:08.658 --> 41:10.284
Boy, did I have a great time tonight.

41:10.285 --> 41:12.604
Shh! Shut up, or
you'll wake up Mozart.

41:13.622 --> 41:15.441
What are you guys doing?

41:15.458 --> 41:16.817
You'll see.

41:23.465 --> 41:26.452
Go ahead, Baron.
But don't wake him up.

41:33.225 --> 41:34.768
What the...?

41:34.769 --> 41:36.896
What's the matter, Motz?
Five-o-clock shadow?

41:36.897 --> 41:38.797
You bastard!

41:40.399 --> 41:41.775
Look out, man, he's got a knife!

41:41.776 --> 41:43.301
I'm gonna kill you!

41:46.906 --> 41:48.182
Uh-oh!

41:50.326 --> 41:51.602
Hey!

41:52.495 --> 41:54.439
What, are you guys kidding me?

41:55.207 --> 41:56.941
Are you nuts or something?

41:57.209 --> 42:00.736
Gimme that. You'll see this at the
end of the summer, if you're lucky.

42:00.878 --> 42:02.029
Idiot.

42:03.673 --> 42:06.008
Come on, Gino, he was just kidding.

42:06.009 --> 42:07.176
Give him a break.

42:07.177 --> 42:09.177
Yeah. Gimme a break.

42:09.178 --> 42:12.248
Maybe I should ask Ronnie
what he thinks I should do.

42:13.266 --> 42:17.295
You'll see it at the end of the summer.
Right, now everybody into bed.

42:17.437 --> 42:19.672
That includes you too, lover boy.

42:39.751 --> 42:40.860
Guess who?

42:41.086 --> 42:43.655
- Um, Ricky.
- Nope!

42:43.755 --> 42:47.534
- Um... Burt Reynolds!
- You're getting warmer.

42:48.468 --> 42:51.013
- I give up!
- Surprise!

42:51.014 --> 42:52.248
Who are you?

42:53.391 --> 42:56.584
Well, well, if it isn't
the two lovebirds.

42:56.727 --> 42:58.327
Why don't you get out of here?

42:58.562 --> 42:59.963
Oh, sorry.

43:00.313 --> 43:02.966
She's such a jerk
sometimes, isn't she?

43:16.998 --> 43:20.359
Uh-oh. Here comes the
wicked witch of the West.

43:23.588 --> 43:25.505
I think I'm gonna go
back into the water.

43:25.506 --> 43:26.991
Talk to you later, Angela.

43:32.096 --> 43:35.249
Well, not going in the
water again, huh, Angela?

43:36.475 --> 43:39.670
What's the matter?
Don't you like to swim?

43:40.229 --> 43:42.132
Can you swim?

43:43.483 --> 43:48.388
Angela, I'm talking to you. Are you
going in the water or aren't you?

43:48.488 --> 43:49.514
Huh?!

43:50.908 --> 43:54.910
Angela! I am waiting for an answer!

43:54.911 --> 43:57.954
Yes or no?

43:57.955 --> 44:02.001
Goddammit, answer me, Angela!
Answer me! Goddammit, answer me!

44:02.002 --> 44:04.420
- What the hell is going on here?
- The little bitch won't answer me!

44:04.421 --> 44:05.822
She never answers me!

44:06.214 --> 44:07.699
You alright, Angela?

44:07.883 --> 44:10.426
Meg, I want to see you in my
shack right after swim period.

44:10.427 --> 44:12.913
Now get back to your post.

44:28.779 --> 44:30.597
Hey, girls.

44:30.614 --> 44:35.118
Let's not forget to thank Angela
for getting Meg in trouble.

44:35.119 --> 44:36.853
I didn't do anything.

44:37.496 --> 44:40.483
You never do shit.

44:46.922 --> 44:48.532
Give me that.

44:58.267 --> 44:59.794
Hey, Angela.

45:00.644 --> 45:06.008
How come you never take showers
when the rest of us do, huh?

45:08.694 --> 45:10.763
You queer or something?

45:12.114 --> 45:16.477
Oh, I know what it is. You
haven't reached puberty yet.

45:16.618 --> 45:17.953
Is that it?

45:17.954 --> 45:20.247
I bet you don't even
have your period.

45:20.248 --> 45:21.415
That's enough, Judy!

45:21.416 --> 45:25.111
Angela's allowed to shower in the
morning or any other time she wants to.

45:25.253 --> 45:29.464
Yeah, she takes showers when no one
can see she has no hair down below.

45:29.465 --> 45:32.342
- Judy!
- She's a real carpenter's dream!

45:32.343 --> 45:34.928
Flat as a board and needs a screw!

45:34.929 --> 45:36.747
- That's enough!
- Fuck off!

45:43.980 --> 45:48.926
I'm going down to see my cousin.
I'll be back before dinner.

46:19.808 --> 46:22.086
You fucking bastards are
gonna pay for this!

46:22.103 --> 46:24.144
Cocksuckers! Pricks!

46:24.145 --> 46:26.089
I'm gonna fight you, chickenshits!

46:28.984 --> 46:34.030
- Angela!
- You chickenshits, you fucking pussies!

46:34.031 --> 46:37.618
I'll kick your friggin asses all
over this goddamn camp, you fucks!

46:37.619 --> 46:41.745
Those pricks, I'll kill 'em!

46:41.746 --> 46:43.565
Take it easy already!

46:44.040 --> 46:46.819
You boys come down from
there immediately.

46:58.848 --> 47:00.974
Those cocksuckers keep
picking on my cousin.

47:00.975 --> 47:02.684
- That's bullshit.
- Enough.

47:02.685 --> 47:04.711
I saw the whole business.

47:05.479 --> 47:06.980
You realize how dangerous
those things are?

47:06.981 --> 47:09.174
You could have taken her eye out.

47:09.275 --> 47:10.900
Ronnie's gonna hear about this,

47:10.901 --> 47:13.988
and there gonna be no
canteen for a whole week.

47:13.989 --> 47:16.323
And that goes for you too on
account of your filthy mouth.

47:16.324 --> 47:17.324
What?!

47:17.325 --> 47:19.910
If I ever hear anything
like this again,

47:19.911 --> 47:22.288
I'm gonna throw the whole
bunch of you out of here,

47:22.289 --> 47:24.232
and don't think I don't mean it.

47:26.835 --> 47:28.403
Get ready for dinner.

47:34.884 --> 47:36.635
How do you feel, Angela? Alright?

47:36.636 --> 47:37.927
She's okay.

47:37.928 --> 47:41.050
Better go change before you catch
pneumonia. It's almost time to eat.

48:09.252 --> 48:11.296
Hey! What are you guys up to, huh?

48:11.297 --> 48:13.923
We got a game against the
counselors. You gonna play?

48:13.924 --> 48:15.343
Sure.

48:15.344 --> 48:18.178
I gotta take a wicked dump first, so
I'll see you guys down there, alright?

48:18.179 --> 48:20.581
Got it. See you later.

49:09.774 --> 49:10.965
Who is that?

49:13.275 --> 49:17.237
Oh, playing games? Is that
you, Benji? Jesus Christ.

49:17.238 --> 49:19.849
I can't even take a shit
in peace around here.

49:23.995 --> 49:27.873
What the hell are you doing?
Hey, get that thing out of here!

49:27.874 --> 49:29.735
Come on, get it out!

49:30.585 --> 49:34.547
Come on! Get it out!
Get it out! No! No! No!

49:34.548 --> 49:36.757
Oh, God! Get away from me!

49:36.758 --> 49:39.702
Get away! Get away from me!

49:39.719 --> 49:43.432
Get away, get away! Somebody
help! Somebody help me!

49:43.433 --> 49:45.975
Help me!

49:45.976 --> 49:47.795
Help me, somebody!

50:15.589 --> 50:17.366
I'm finished!

50:18.509 --> 50:21.788
That's all there is to it.
Finished. Wiped out.

50:23.474 --> 50:25.250
How many are left?

50:26.100 --> 50:28.627
I'd say about twenty-five.

50:29.187 --> 50:31.354
We might as well pack
everything and shut down.

50:31.355 --> 50:33.398
Nobody's ever gonna send
their kids here again.

50:33.399 --> 50:36.568
Why don't we finish the summer, Mel?
Tomorrow I'll consolidate the bunks.

50:36.569 --> 50:38.850
There's no sense in keeping
everyone spread out.

50:38.947 --> 50:40.180
Yeah.

50:40.449 --> 50:42.241
Why make things easier
for the killer?

50:42.242 --> 50:44.619
Hey, don't talk like that. We
don't know anything for sure yet.

50:44.620 --> 50:48.439
I know! I've known all along.
I've seen the hate in his eyes.

50:48.956 --> 50:53.502
But I never did anything. Now,
I'll stop him for what he's done to me.

50:53.503 --> 50:54.711
I'll stop him!

50:54.712 --> 50:57.490
Snap out of it, will you, Mel?
You're talking crazy.

50:57.633 --> 51:05.080
Yeah, maybe I am. Maybe
I'm just... imagining it.

51:10.938 --> 51:13.089
Maybe.

51:49.852 --> 51:51.937
Boo! Scared you, huh?

51:51.938 --> 51:53.938
I thought you were the killer.

51:53.939 --> 51:56.857
Oh, come on. Don't tell me you
believe all that bologna.

51:56.858 --> 51:58.944
Yeah, well what happened to Billy?

51:58.945 --> 52:01.344
Somebody was playing a joke
and it got out of hand.

52:01.363 --> 52:04.224
Now come on. Let's get out of
here before we get caught.

52:04.742 --> 52:06.742
- Or murdered.
- Where are we going?

52:06.743 --> 52:08.688
To the lake.

52:22.719 --> 52:25.454
Wait'll I get my hands on you!

52:39.819 --> 52:41.486
No, don't.

52:41.487 --> 52:45.182
Come on, Angela.
I'm not doing anything.

53:34.250 --> 53:35.317
No!

53:36.960 --> 53:38.737
Angela!

53:38.796 --> 53:41.156
Angela!

53:45.387 --> 53:48.039
Okay, let me have your
attention for one minute.

53:48.139 --> 53:52.418
The last few days we've been using
the regular activity schedule.

53:52.560 --> 53:53.935
And that bites the big one,

53:53.936 --> 53:56.479
so today we're going to try
something a little different, okay?

53:56.480 --> 53:59.232
Like in Color War, you're
gonna be separated into

53:59.233 --> 54:01.886
two groups and we're gonna
play capture the flag.

54:02.404 --> 54:07.741
For you guys who have never played before,
Gene is going to explain the rules.

54:07.742 --> 54:10.703
Alright, gangsters, listen up, because
this is going to be a lot of fun.

54:10.704 --> 54:13.621
Now, depending on what team you're on,
you're going to be wearing white strips

54:13.622 --> 54:17.126
or blue strips. The guys with the blue
strips have to capture the white flag,

54:17.127 --> 54:19.294
and the guys with the white strips
have to capture the blue flag.

54:19.295 --> 54:20.587
Sounds easy enough, right?

54:20.588 --> 54:23.841
Now, to capture the flag you've got to
sneak into the other guy's territory.

54:23.842 --> 54:26.260
Capture his flag without getting
one of your strips taken off.

54:26.261 --> 54:30.541
First guy to capture the flag
wins, and that's about it.

54:35.311 --> 54:38.381
I still don't understand why you
got so upset about last night.

54:38.857 --> 54:41.276
I wasn't doing anything
that bad, was I?

54:41.277 --> 54:46.071
I'm sorry, Paul. I just
wasn't ready. I just...

54:46.072 --> 54:49.325
- Hey, I understand.
- Please don't.

54:49.326 --> 54:51.227
What's the matter with you?

54:51.995 --> 54:53.939
I have to go.

54:55.124 --> 54:56.440
Angela!

54:57.000 --> 54:59.653
- Angela!
- Let her go.

54:59.670 --> 55:02.406
I really don't know why you
keep bothering with her.

55:02.757 --> 55:05.216
She's so small.

55:05.217 --> 55:10.121
- What do you know?
- I know a lot of things.

55:21.066 --> 55:25.637
Angela, you gotta help me. I got
a great plan to get the flag.

55:25.654 --> 55:27.822
We cut through the woods
and sneak up behind them.

55:27.823 --> 55:29.949
You go in one way and
I go in the other.

55:29.950 --> 55:30.909
It can't miss!

55:30.910 --> 55:34.188
- I don't feel like playing, Ricky.
- Oh, come on.

55:34.497 --> 55:35.872
Help me out, will you?

55:35.873 --> 55:37.608
I can't do it by myself.

55:37.833 --> 55:39.027
Please?

55:39.586 --> 55:42.963
After we get the flag the game will be
over and you won't have to play anymore.

55:42.964 --> 55:44.282
Okay?

55:44.841 --> 55:48.035
- Alright, where do we have to go?
- Follow me.

56:03.443 --> 56:06.110
The flag should be around
there, past those trees.

56:06.111 --> 56:08.029
You go in from this side,
and I'll walk around

56:08.030 --> 56:09.490
and attack from the other side.

56:09.490 --> 56:11.450
They'll never be able
to catch both of us.

56:11.451 --> 56:13.728
How do I know when to come out?

56:14.329 --> 56:15.688
Good question.

56:16.039 --> 56:17.289
Tell you what.

56:17.290 --> 56:19.751
Give me about five minutes, and
when I see them run after you,

56:19.752 --> 56:21.487
I'll sneak out and grab the flag.

56:22.004 --> 56:25.949
- I hope it works.
- No sweat, it's foolproof.

56:36.017 --> 56:39.295
Come on. No one will see us.

56:39.813 --> 56:42.007
Jesus, will you loosen up already?

56:46.736 --> 56:49.431
That wasn't so bad, was it?

56:49.823 --> 56:51.391
I guess not.

56:58.207 --> 56:59.608
Angela!

57:00.001 --> 57:01.777
Angela!

57:02.168 --> 57:04.905
Hey. Where are you going?

57:07.550 --> 57:09.926
You're a real scumbag,
Judy, you know that?

57:09.927 --> 57:11.662
Fuck you, Ricky.

57:11.679 --> 57:13.580
You're just jealous.

57:14.891 --> 57:16.376
Same to you.

57:36.830 --> 57:39.399
Mind if I sit here?

57:42.418 --> 57:47.464
Angela, I'm really sorry
about what happened before.

57:47.465 --> 57:49.409
I really am.

57:50.385 --> 57:53.830
I don't know what happened.
She just wouldn't leave me alone.

57:56.600 --> 57:59.626
Come on, Angela. Please?

58:00.603 --> 58:03.256
Give me another chance, will you?

58:03.690 --> 58:05.007
Please?

58:05.566 --> 58:07.859
Back together so soon?

58:07.860 --> 58:11.181
Boy, Angela, you
sure are forgiving.

58:11.657 --> 58:14.434
Especially after he told
me what a prude you are.

58:15.745 --> 58:18.688
That is the word you
used, isn't it, Paul?

58:19.413 --> 58:21.691
I gotta go.

58:22.834 --> 58:24.402
Bye, Paul.

58:26.380 --> 58:28.407
It's really no big deal, you know.

58:29.049 --> 58:31.035
I mean, he's okay for you.

58:33.304 --> 58:36.889
How about a little
swim, huh, Angela?

58:36.890 --> 58:42.962
What do you say we get that beautiful
bod of yours into the water, hmm?

58:47.985 --> 58:49.778
- Hello, Ricky.
- Hi, Mel.

58:49.779 --> 58:52.155
Seems we haven't had much
of a chance to talk.

58:52.156 --> 58:54.491
How's your summer been so far?

58:54.492 --> 58:57.102
- Alright, I guess.
- Just alright?

58:57.202 --> 59:00.414
Well, it would have been better
if there were more guys around.

59:00.415 --> 59:02.541
It's kind of hard to get a
ball game up now, you know?

59:02.542 --> 59:03.942
Yeah.

59:04.669 --> 59:07.530
It is a shame so many had to leave.

59:08.548 --> 59:12.118
So how about it, Angela?
Let's go for a swim.

59:13.052 --> 59:16.096
Oh, what's the matter? You afraid?

59:16.097 --> 59:17.556
Huh?

59:17.557 --> 59:18.999
Huh?

59:19.642 --> 59:23.020
Well say something,
you spoiled little bitch!

59:23.021 --> 59:24.813
What's the problem?

59:24.814 --> 59:27.692
My good friend Angela here

59:27.693 --> 59:30.360
doesn't feel like going
in the water today.

59:30.361 --> 59:32.904
Oh, she doesn't, does she?

59:32.905 --> 59:35.099
Well, I think I can fix that.

59:36.159 --> 59:39.161
No! Stop it! Let me down!

59:39.162 --> 59:43.291
Stop it! Please! Don't
throw me in the water!

59:43.292 --> 59:45.277
Please, let me go!

59:45.294 --> 59:48.629
With all this bad publicity, I don't
see how I can hold onto the camp.

59:48.630 --> 59:49.823
One sec...

59:50.299 --> 59:52.340
- I asked you a question!
- Hey, what are you doing?

59:52.341 --> 59:55.594
Just like all those other times. She gets
into trouble and you run to her rescue.

59:55.595 --> 59:56.929
You try to take care of everybody.

59:56.930 --> 01:00:00.183
How you gonna do it this time? Another
drowning, or something worse?

01:00:00.184 --> 01:00:01.601
What are you talking about?
Let me go!

01:00:01.602 --> 01:00:03.311
I saw you those times!

01:00:03.312 --> 01:00:05.897
In the rec room, at the water
fight, you killed them!

01:00:05.898 --> 01:00:09.342
Stop it! Don't throw
me in the water!

01:00:09.444 --> 01:00:14.363
Stop, please! I don't
know how to swim!

01:00:14.364 --> 01:00:19.243
You killed them to destroy me,
didn't you? Didn't you?!

01:00:19.244 --> 01:00:21.938
Jesus Christ, Mel! What
the hell are you doing?

01:00:23.457 --> 01:00:25.651
Angela!

01:00:34.468 --> 01:00:35.870
Oh, poor baby.

01:00:38.972 --> 01:00:41.375
You're a real peckerhead,
you know that, Meg?

01:00:46.147 --> 01:00:47.730
Little fuckers!

01:00:47.731 --> 01:00:51.219
Hey! Animals! Knock it off!

01:00:59.661 --> 01:01:02.079
Calm down, Angela. It's okay now.

01:01:02.080 --> 01:01:04.273
Everything's gonna be alright.

01:01:04.332 --> 01:01:07.484
We won't let them get away
with this, that's for sure.

01:01:07.836 --> 01:01:09.861
I promise we won't.

01:01:13.883 --> 01:01:17.370
Okay, the only activity scheduled for
tonight is a social in the rec room.

01:01:17.470 --> 01:01:19.721
Those on duty can start bringing
your kids up around nine,

01:01:19.722 --> 01:01:23.768
except for Eddie, who I've got some
bigger and better things planned.

01:01:23.769 --> 01:01:25.810
- A night off!
- Even better than that.

01:01:25.811 --> 01:01:27.729
Tonight you get to take those
little darlings of yours

01:01:27.730 --> 01:01:29.757
on a camping trip on the lake.

01:01:30.859 --> 01:01:34.654
The campfire, sleeping under the
stars, bacon and eggs for breakfast.

01:01:34.655 --> 01:01:36.738
- I can't wait.
- Okay.

01:01:36.739 --> 01:01:41.494
As for the rest of you, you're all on
tonight, except for... Let me see...

01:01:41.495 --> 01:01:44.037
- Jerry and Meg. Any questions?
- Yea.

01:01:44.038 --> 01:01:45.205
What's that?

01:01:45.206 --> 01:01:46.456
Anybody want to switch?

01:01:46.457 --> 01:01:49.570
Sorry, Eddie. Have a
good evening, everybody.

01:01:54.340 --> 01:01:56.592
- Boy, are you lucky.
- You ain't kidding.

01:01:56.593 --> 01:01:59.314
- I could sure use the night off.
- You and the rest of us.

01:01:59.847 --> 01:02:01.583
I'll see you later, okay?

01:02:04.726 --> 01:02:06.686
Hey, guess who has the
night off tonight?

01:02:06.687 --> 01:02:08.588
Well, congratulations.

01:02:09.857 --> 01:02:13.401
Listen, I was thinking... Remember
that dinner you promised me?

01:02:13.402 --> 01:02:15.012
UP at your place?

01:02:17.657 --> 01:02:21.851
Yeah. Nine, nine-thirty?

01:02:22.703 --> 01:02:24.813
You got it. See you then.

01:02:37.259 --> 01:02:38.761
What are you so happy about?

01:02:38.762 --> 01:02:42.180
- Got me a date tonight.
- Oh yeah? With who?

01:02:42.181 --> 01:02:44.124
It's a secret.

01:02:49.188 --> 01:02:51.830
I don't suppose you guys would
let me go next, would you?

01:02:53.568 --> 01:02:55.386
Didn't think so.

01:02:57.698 --> 01:03:02.117
Hey, Jude! Jude! Jude!
Is the water still on next door?

01:03:02.118 --> 01:03:04.395
- I guess so.
- Great.

01:03:04.662 --> 01:03:05.897
See you later.

01:04:24.910 --> 01:04:27.688
Hey, no fighting back there.

01:04:30.542 --> 01:04:32.402
Okay, guys, let's go.

01:04:36.213 --> 01:04:39.658
You guys got all that stuff out
of the car, right? Hey, quit it!

01:04:41.344 --> 01:04:42.803
Give me that.

01:04:42.804 --> 01:04:45.707
- This isn't a toy!
- I wasn't doing anything!

01:04:46.350 --> 01:04:50.644
Look, guys, you set up and I'll go
get some wood for the fire, ok?

01:04:50.645 --> 01:04:52.005
Can I come, Eddie?

01:04:52.355 --> 01:04:54.089
What are you, my shadow?

01:04:56.359 --> 01:04:58.510
Alright. Alright.
Come on, let's go.

01:05:12.084 --> 01:05:13.443
Hi.

01:05:15.212 --> 01:05:16.821
Do you know where Ricky is?

01:05:17.798 --> 01:05:19.783
He's back at the bunk lying down.

01:05:19.800 --> 01:05:23.077
Said he didn't feel good after
dinner, but he might come by later.

01:05:24.013 --> 01:05:25.539
Look, Angela.

01:05:26.265 --> 01:05:30.668
I'm really sorry about what
I did. I know I was wrong.

01:05:30.685 --> 01:05:32.812
Can't you forgive
me just this once?

01:05:32.813 --> 01:05:34.340
Please?

01:05:34.731 --> 01:05:36.982
I didn't mean what
I said about you.

01:05:36.983 --> 01:05:38.761
I was just pissed off.

01:05:39.904 --> 01:05:41.113
I swear it.

01:05:41.114 --> 01:05:43.030
Excuse us, kids.

01:05:43.031 --> 01:05:46.143
Don't they make a lovely couple.

01:05:48.453 --> 01:05:50.314
I really hate that girl.

01:05:53.167 --> 01:05:56.752
Please, Angela. I'm really sorry.

01:05:56.753 --> 01:05:58.656
You know I am.

01:05:59.340 --> 01:06:01.033
Please forgive me.

01:06:02.718 --> 01:06:03.911
Please?

01:06:07.222 --> 01:06:10.042
Meet me at the waterfront
after the social.

01:06:11.561 --> 01:06:12.878
I'll be there.

01:06:26.701 --> 01:06:27.768
Eddie.

01:06:28.536 --> 01:06:30.729
Eddie, I'm cold.

01:06:30.956 --> 01:06:33.275
- Eddie!
- What do you want?

01:06:33.541 --> 01:06:36.486
I want to go back. I'm cold!

01:06:37.129 --> 01:06:40.213
- Forget it.
- Eddie!

01:06:40.214 --> 01:06:44.536
- Please, Eddie, I want to go back.
- I want to come too!

01:06:47.598 --> 01:06:50.224
You guys are really pains
in my ass, you know that?

01:06:50.225 --> 01:06:51.877
Please?

01:06:54.646 --> 01:06:57.465
Alright. Up to the car.

01:07:49.827 --> 01:07:50.786
Susie?

01:07:50.787 --> 01:07:52.204
Have you seen Meg anywhere?

01:07:52.205 --> 01:07:54.122
- She's off tonight, Mel.
- Yeah, I know.

01:07:54.123 --> 01:07:56.250
She was supposed to meet
me about an hour ago.

01:07:56.251 --> 01:07:57.709
Did you check the bunk?

01:07:57.710 --> 01:07:59.045
Not yet.

01:07:59.046 --> 01:08:02.448
If you see her, tell her I'm looking
for her. Will you, please?

01:08:13.434 --> 01:08:16.379
- Do you have to kiss so wet?
- Sorry.

01:08:23.194 --> 01:08:25.305
Quick. Under the bed.

01:08:30.702 --> 01:08:32.812
- Hi, Mel.
- Hey,

01:08:33.747 --> 01:08:35.497
You're not going to the
social tonight, eh?

01:08:35.499 --> 01:08:38.000
I'm a little tired, so I thought
I might get to bed early.

01:08:38.001 --> 01:08:41.420
Oh, yeah? I'm looking for
Meg, have you seen her?

01:08:41.421 --> 01:08:44.591
The last time I saw Meg, she was
going next door to take a shower.

01:08:44.591 --> 01:08:46.827
- When was that?
- I don't know.

01:08:47.051 --> 01:08:48.412
After dinner sometime.

01:08:50.305 --> 01:08:51.747
Alright, thanks.

01:08:54.477 --> 01:08:58.671
You know, you could ruin your eyes
reading in the dark like that.

01:09:09.033 --> 01:09:11.283
Look. I think I'd better beat it.

01:09:11.285 --> 01:09:12.118
What?

01:09:12.120 --> 01:09:13.536
You just got here!

01:09:13.537 --> 01:09:15.203
I don't know, I just don't
want to get caught.

01:09:15.203 --> 01:09:17.540
Cut the crap, Mike. He won't
be back and you know it.

01:09:17.541 --> 01:09:20.042
You never know. Look,
I'll see you tomorrow.

01:09:20.044 --> 01:09:21.569
Don't bet on it.

01:09:22.671 --> 01:09:24.240
Chickenshit.

01:09:48.990 --> 01:09:50.265
Meg?

01:09:52.577 --> 01:09:54.227
Are you in there?

01:10:12.097 --> 01:10:13.873
Oh my God.

01:10:14.307 --> 01:10:16.918
Not you, Meg.

01:10:18.562 --> 01:10:21.689
He did this to get back at me!

01:10:21.690 --> 01:10:25.318
I had him. I had him
and let him go.

01:10:25.319 --> 01:10:28.555
Forgive me, Meg, please forgive me.

01:10:29.865 --> 01:10:31.641
I'll stop him.

01:10:31.658 --> 01:10:33.559
I've got to stop him!

01:10:34.953 --> 01:10:36.938
He won't get away, Meg.

01:10:37.664 --> 01:10:40.567
He'll never get away from me again.

01:10:56.975 --> 01:10:58.476
Mike?

01:10:58.477 --> 01:10:59.754
Is that you?

01:11:06.694 --> 01:11:08.011
Who is that?

01:11:13.325 --> 01:11:15.618
Well, whoever it is,
don't turn the light on,

01:11:15.619 --> 01:11:17.855
or we'll have to go
to the stupid social.

01:11:31.385 --> 01:11:35.055
Oh, it's you. What do you want?

01:11:35.056 --> 01:11:37.250
Well?

01:13:11.070 --> 01:13:12.596
Help.

01:13:14.365 --> 01:13:15.684
Somebody.

01:13:16.827 --> 01:13:18.769
Help.

01:13:21.372 --> 01:13:24.275
Help! Help!

01:13:24.792 --> 01:13:26.944
Somebody help!

01:13:33.802 --> 01:13:36.637
Wait a minute. Where do
you think you're going?

01:13:36.638 --> 01:13:39.347
- Inside, to get something to eat.
- Oh, no. The social's over.

01:13:39.348 --> 01:13:40.391
Get back to your bunk.

01:13:40.392 --> 01:13:41.349
Give me a break, huh?

01:13:41.350 --> 01:13:44.060
I've been lying down all night
because dinner made me sick.

01:13:44.061 --> 01:13:46.506
Just let me grab
something real quick.

01:13:46.648 --> 01:13:48.717
Well, dinner was shitty.

01:13:49.401 --> 01:13:51.553
- Just make it snappy.
- Thanks, Jeff.

01:14:14.343 --> 01:14:15.802
Hello?

01:14:15.803 --> 01:14:17.996
Speaking.

01:14:18.430 --> 01:14:19.622
What?

01:14:19.806 --> 01:14:21.833
Oh, God, no.

01:14:23.853 --> 01:14:25.253
Three of them?

01:14:26.188 --> 01:14:29.300
Listen, I'll get them now.
Right now, I will.

01:14:30.192 --> 01:14:31.526
I just don't believe it, though.

01:14:31.527 --> 01:14:35.071
I gotcha now, you little
monster. Now it's my turn!

01:14:35.072 --> 01:14:37.281
Get the fuck off of me!
Leave me alone!

01:14:37.282 --> 01:14:41.479
You killed that Benny and
Billy just like you left Meg!

01:14:41.787 --> 01:14:43.955
I don't know what the fuck
you're talking about!

01:14:43.956 --> 01:14:45.358
I didn't do nothing!

01:14:45.500 --> 01:14:48.486
Stop it! I didn't do
anything, you crazy fuck!

01:14:49.337 --> 01:14:51.463
Stop it! I didn't do nothing!

01:14:51.464 --> 01:14:54.324
Liar! Liar! Liar!

01:14:56.510 --> 01:14:59.596
Marie, find all the counselors and have
them meet me in my shack right away.

01:14:59.597 --> 01:15:00.639
I'll go get the ones below.

01:15:00.640 --> 01:15:02.320
- What happened?
- Just get them!

01:15:03.476 --> 01:15:06.962
Liar!

01:15:09.273 --> 01:15:13.527
I got him. Just like
I promised Meg.

01:15:13.528 --> 01:15:15.388
I got him.

01:15:17.865 --> 01:15:19.600
Wait.

01:15:20.660 --> 01:15:22.478
I gotta get away.

01:15:30.045 --> 01:15:32.154
It can't be you.

01:15:32.296 --> 01:15:34.006
It can't be!

01:15:34.007 --> 01:15:35.699
It can't be!

01:15:49.649 --> 01:15:51.899
- I filled them all in.
- Alright, great.

01:15:51.900 --> 01:15:53.985
Now I suggest you send
them all back to their kids

01:15:53.986 --> 01:15:56.195
to make sure everyone stays inside.

01:15:56.196 --> 01:15:58.823
- Angela and Judy are missing.
- Oh, no.

01:15:58.824 --> 01:16:00.616
- What's all the fuss?
- There's a killer loose.

01:16:00.617 --> 01:16:02.869
Make sure no one leaves
your bunk for any reason.

01:16:02.870 --> 01:16:04.413
Paul and Ricky haven't
come back yet.

01:16:04.414 --> 01:16:05.747
We'd better go look
for them right now.

01:16:05.748 --> 01:16:06.956
Everybody out in pairs.

01:16:06.957 --> 01:16:09.459
Look everywhere you can think
of, even the empty cabins.

01:16:09.460 --> 01:16:11.653
Let me get my flashlight.

01:16:33.568 --> 01:16:35.368
I didn't think you were gonna show.

01:16:39.032 --> 01:16:41.434
- Let's go swimming.
- Now?

01:16:41.868 --> 01:16:45.188
- What about our clothes?
- Take them off.

01:16:46.331 --> 01:16:47.732
OK!

01:17:26.871 --> 01:17:28.356
Found one.

01:17:30.709 --> 01:17:32.193
Ricky.

01:17:37.383 --> 01:17:38.742
Hey, he's alive!

01:17:54.984 --> 01:17:56.511
It's Meg.

01:17:56.570 --> 01:17:58.971
It's so horrible!

01:18:23.345 --> 01:18:24.955
Angela!

01:18:25.098 --> 01:18:26.582
Judy!

01:18:26.683 --> 01:18:29.835
Ricky, Paul! You guys out here?

01:18:31.146 --> 01:18:32.922
Hey. You hear something?

01:18:33.607 --> 01:18:35.758
- What?
- Listen.

01:18:36.484 --> 01:18:38.344
Sounds like singing.

01:18:40.112 --> 01:18:43.308
Damn it. It's coming
from over here.

01:18:50.707 --> 01:18:52.150
It's Angela!

01:18:52.585 --> 01:18:55.279
Angela! Are you alright?

01:18:56.505 --> 01:18:59.615
Angela! Are you okay?

01:19:00.633 --> 01:19:02.535
Angela, can you hear me?

01:19:09.602 --> 01:19:12.645
Oh, you're going to enjoy
living with us so much!

01:19:12.646 --> 01:19:14.272
Yes, I know you are.

01:19:14.273 --> 01:19:18.400
As a welcome-home present I bought
you such wonderful new clothes.

01:19:18.401 --> 01:19:22.154
I just hope that Richard doesn't get
jealous that I didn't get him anything.

01:19:22.155 --> 01:19:26.559
Oh, but then he is such a dear.
I'm sure that he won't mind.

01:19:26.576 --> 01:19:29.496
You see, I've always
wanted a little girl.

01:19:29.497 --> 01:19:32.207
But of course, when
my husband left...

01:19:32.208 --> 01:19:33.416
Oh, well!

01:19:33.417 --> 01:19:36.126
That's all water under the
bridge, as I always say.

01:19:36.127 --> 01:19:38.128
Water under the bridge.

01:19:38.129 --> 01:19:41.675
But it certainly will be a nice little
surprise when Richard comes home

01:19:41.676 --> 01:19:43.702
to find a little girl in the house.

01:19:44.094 --> 01:19:49.458
Yes, I've always dreamed of a
little girl just like you.

01:19:49.685 --> 01:19:51.894
I mean, we already have a boy.

01:19:51.895 --> 01:19:56.772
So another one simply would not do.
Oh, no, absolutely not.

01:19:56.773 --> 01:20:01.261
A little girl would be so much nicer.
Don't you think so, Angela?

01:20:01.696 --> 01:20:03.447
Angela...

01:20:03.448 --> 01:20:05.684
Such a lovely name.

01:20:06.701 --> 01:20:08.785
Why, I believe it means "angel."

01:20:08.786 --> 01:20:10.955
Why, yes. I'm sure it does.

01:20:10.956 --> 01:20:13.249
I know you're going
to like that name.

01:20:13.250 --> 01:20:15.651
Won't you, Peter?

01:20:20.464 --> 01:20:22.408
How can it be?
