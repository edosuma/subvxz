WEBVTT

00:05.380 --> 00:07.424
Welcome to the grand opening

00:07.508 --> 00:10.886
of our newest
Bowser's Backyard Doggy Day Care,

00:10.969 --> 00:12.513
right here in Middleton.

00:12.596 --> 00:16.808
With state-of-the-art facilities
and a passion for professionalism,

00:16.892 --> 00:21.355
it's no wonder Bowser's is the top-rated
doggy day care in the region.

00:21.438 --> 00:24.191
Come on in
and see what everyone's barking about.

00:24.274 --> 00:28.320
Your dog is in great paws
here at Bowser's.

00:31.532 --> 00:34.660
I still can't believe I get to be
a student volunteer at Bowser's.

00:34.743 --> 00:36.370
This truly is a dream come true.

00:36.954 --> 00:39.957
No, I'm serious.
I actually dreamed about it.

00:40.040 --> 00:41.708
I heard that Bowser's Backyard

00:41.792 --> 00:45.254
is one of the largest
female-owned businesses in the state.

00:45.337 --> 00:48.048
-You heard that from me.
-I knew it was a reputable source.

00:48.131 --> 00:50.676
I mean,
a business based on taking care of dogs

00:50.759 --> 00:53.637
is the perfect place for me to volunteer
for service week.

00:53.720 --> 00:56.139
Who knows?
Maybe one day I'll open my own Bowser's

00:56.223 --> 00:58.725
and be able to be surrounded by dogs
all day, every day.

00:58.809 --> 01:02.312
Now, honey, I know you're excited,
but you don't start for two days.

01:02.396 --> 01:05.147
Maybe you should
take off the uniform before dinner.

01:05.232 --> 01:07.651
-What are we having?
-Sloppy joes.

01:07.734 --> 01:09.111
Yep, I should change.

01:14.741 --> 01:19.079
So, buddy, we know what Lizzie's doing.
What's your plan for service week?

01:22.082 --> 01:24.168
I bet he'll pay attention to this.

01:25.586 --> 01:27.296
No, no, wait! It's almost done.

01:27.379 --> 01:30.591
They're about to explain how
Lord Koh became the Majestic Dog Warrior.

01:30.674 --> 01:32.259
-But what about--
-Service week?

01:32.342 --> 01:35.554
I promise I'll pick something. I promise.

01:36.138 --> 01:39.683
Just make sure you do it by tomorrow.
Did you hear me?

01:41.518 --> 01:42.644
Charles.

01:43.645 --> 01:45.105
Charles!

01:45.189 --> 01:46.190
Charles.

01:46.899 --> 01:49.359
-Charles!
-Two-thirds.

01:51.111 --> 01:52.279
Pardon me?

01:52.863 --> 01:56.366
-Two-thirds is bigger than one-half.
-Correct.

01:56.450 --> 01:59.620
Unfortunately,
fractions was 15 minutes ago.

01:59.703 --> 02:03.582
We're now discussing service week,
which you have failed to sign up for.

02:03.665 --> 02:05.709
Notice how I emphasize the word "failed."

02:05.792 --> 02:08.336
I have a good explanation.

02:10.005 --> 02:12.049
Is there more to that sentence?

02:12.132 --> 02:13.717
It's my fault.

02:13.800 --> 02:15.886
I find that hard to believe, Sammy.

02:15.969 --> 02:17.804
Maybe we should hear him out.

02:19.431 --> 02:21.558
Charles and I are doing a team project,

02:21.642 --> 02:24.603
and I forgot to put his name
on the sign-up sheet.

02:24.686 --> 02:27.940
See, I told you
there was a good explanation.

02:28.023 --> 02:29.358
Very well then.

02:46.875 --> 02:49.586
Lizzie! You're here early.

02:49.670 --> 02:52.923
I read that in business,
early is on time, on time is late,

02:53.006 --> 02:54.675
late is unacceptable.

02:55.300 --> 02:59.346
That is exactly what I learned
from our founder, Emma Bowser, herself.

03:00.889 --> 03:03.100
I brought these to celebrate my first day.

03:03.183 --> 03:06.645
Thank you. They look delicious.

03:06.728 --> 03:09.523
No! Those are for the dog "guests."

03:09.606 --> 03:13.485
I wanted them to have something homemade
while they're here, away from home.

03:14.152 --> 03:15.362
How thoughtful.

03:16.280 --> 03:20.200
So, you have a permit to operate a kitchen
for commercial purposes?

03:21.034 --> 03:23.537
No, just a regular kitchen.

03:23.620 --> 03:26.081
But our dishwasher
does have a sanitize setting.

03:26.790 --> 03:30.460
Unfortunately, we can only serve
commercial-grade treats here.

03:31.587 --> 03:33.964
I know it may sound a little extreme,

03:34.047 --> 03:37.176
but there's a reason
that we're the best at what we do.

03:37.259 --> 03:39.887
That's why I like to follow
Mrs. Bowser's rules.

03:40.637 --> 03:42.514
You don't have to tell me about rules.

03:42.598 --> 03:46.059
You do have to tell me about these rules,
but not about rules in general.

03:46.143 --> 03:47.144
Rules rule.

03:48.937 --> 03:51.899
Everything looks
just as good as the commercial.

03:51.982 --> 03:54.943
I think we found the right place, pal.

03:55.027 --> 03:57.946
-He's so cute.
-Believe me, he knows it.

03:58.030 --> 04:01.658
-What's his name?
-Count Pugsworth von Smooshface.

04:01.742 --> 04:03.785
But I mostly call him Pugsley.

04:04.286 --> 04:07.247
We're delighted
you chose Bowser's to care for Pugsley.

04:07.331 --> 04:10.000
Here is your welcome packet
and your new client manual.

04:10.083 --> 04:11.543
Let me show you the facilities.

04:11.627 --> 04:14.171
There's no need.
I already took the virtual tour.

04:14.254 --> 04:18.300
So Pugsley loves attention,
and he can be a little bit of a handful.

04:18.382 --> 04:22.888
Okay. Don't be mad.
Daddy will be back soon. Pugs and kisses.

04:22.971 --> 04:24.890
Okay. All right.

04:24.973 --> 04:26.016
I'll…

04:26.517 --> 04:27.893
-Thank you.
-All right.

04:30.103 --> 04:31.647
I can put him in his kennel.

04:32.648 --> 04:37.361
I love the can-do attitude, Lizzie,
but our regulations clearly state…

04:38.570 --> 04:41.490
only full-time employees
can handle the dogs.

04:42.866 --> 04:44.493
Here you go, sweetie.

04:45.744 --> 04:46.787
Do you understand?

04:46.870 --> 04:50.874
Not totally, but that's okay.
It's service week and I'm here to serve.

04:50.958 --> 04:53.168
Anything you need, just name it.

05:01.093 --> 05:03.136
I name it "the big mess."

05:13.230 --> 05:17.943
Sammy, guess what? They just dropped
the new season of AnimeZing Adventures.

05:19.486 --> 05:20.487
Goldie!

05:22.531 --> 05:25.075
-Where's Rufus?
-Upstairs in Grandma Dayle's room.

05:25.158 --> 05:27.911
I don't blame him. What's that smell?

05:27.995 --> 05:30.247
That is our service week project.

05:30.330 --> 05:32.833
Composting is a way
to break down organic matter

05:32.916 --> 05:35.377
so it can be used as fertilizer
to help plants grow.

05:36.170 --> 05:38.547
-Okay.
-I know. It's so cool.

05:38.630 --> 05:39.631
Not only that,

05:39.715 --> 05:42.885
we'll be donating our compost
to the Middleton Community Garden.

05:42.968 --> 05:46.638
-So let's get postin'.
-What if we watch, then work?

05:46.722 --> 05:49.433
The Majestic Dog Warrior
has a new sidekick,

05:49.516 --> 05:52.477
Moshi Mosha, a talking ball of ice cream.

05:53.478 --> 05:54.771
Goldie wants to watch too.

05:55.647 --> 05:58.483
Okay. Did I mention
that we're not just pit composting?

05:58.567 --> 06:02.487
I decided to kick it up a notch.
We're vermicomposting too.

06:02.571 --> 06:03.906
Vermi-what?

06:03.989 --> 06:07.492
It's composting, but with
some special friends to help us out.

06:07.576 --> 06:08.869
Worms?

06:08.952 --> 06:11.997
Not just any worms. Red wrigglers.

06:13.290 --> 06:16.460
You, me, and miracle of nature.

06:16.543 --> 06:19.963
-Yeah, it's gonna be great, right?
-Yeah, great.

06:35.103 --> 06:37.439
Pugsley? Is that you?

06:39.816 --> 06:40.901
I know.

06:42.569 --> 06:44.196
It's my first day too.

06:45.489 --> 06:47.449
-Lizzie.
-I'm sorry.

06:47.533 --> 06:51.119
I just-- Pugsley started whining,
and my instincts kicked in.

06:51.203 --> 06:53.747
You know, my brother and I,
we foster dogs.

06:53.830 --> 06:57.584
That's wonderful, and I really appreciate
how much you love dogs.

06:57.668 --> 07:00.921
-But remember, Bowser's is a business.
-Of course.

07:02.089 --> 07:06.677
As for Pugsley, some dogs
just take a little time to get settled.

07:06.760 --> 07:07.845
He'll be fine.

07:11.598 --> 07:14.560
Just stick to the rules,
and you'll do great.

07:14.643 --> 07:16.895
Bang-up job on the shed, by the way.

07:16.979 --> 07:19.940
I see a five-star evaluation
in your future.

07:21.024 --> 07:23.110
Thanks, Ruth. I won't let you down.

07:27.698 --> 07:30.117
But I don't want to let you down either,
Pugsley.

07:37.958 --> 07:39.168
Can I have one more?

07:39.251 --> 07:42.754
Hey. Somebody loves my secret taco recipe.

07:42.838 --> 07:45.465
Leftover sloppy joe
in a tortilla with hot sauce?

07:46.049 --> 07:47.342
Don't ruin the mystery.

07:48.010 --> 07:51.722
I worked all day with Sammy. I'm starving.

07:51.805 --> 07:55.225
Now you know where the expression
"working up an appetite" comes from.

07:55.309 --> 07:59.521
Lizzie, you seem a little down.
Did something happen today at Bowser's?

07:59.605 --> 08:01.023
No. No, no.

08:01.106 --> 08:04.610
I mean, yes. A lot happened.
I was just busy.

08:05.110 --> 08:07.821
-Very busy.
-I feel like there's a "but" coming.

08:09.114 --> 08:11.909
I just didn't realize
there'd be so many rules.

08:11.992 --> 08:16.371
I didn't know Sammy would have
so many rules either. Wanna trade?

08:16.455 --> 08:19.124
You can compost,
and I can play with the dogs.

08:19.208 --> 08:20.667
It's not playing with dogs.

08:20.751 --> 08:23.337
-It's a business.
-Honey, it was your first day.

08:23.420 --> 08:27.132
I bet everyone appreciated you
bringing in those homemade treats, right?

08:28.717 --> 08:31.220
Can we just not talk about it?

08:31.303 --> 08:32.513
Of course.

08:34.014 --> 08:37.267
Five, four, three…

08:37.351 --> 08:41.313
It's just-- There's this puppy, Pugsley.
He wanted attention, so I held him.

08:41.395 --> 08:44.900
But it's "against the rules"
for student volunteers to handle the dogs.

08:44.983 --> 08:49.488
But you know how to hold dogs.
You do it all the time. Did you tell them?

08:49.571 --> 08:53.033
Charles, it's not our house.
They have their own rules.

08:53.116 --> 08:57.704
I have faith you'll find a way to follow
the rules and give Pugsley what he needs.

08:57.788 --> 09:00.624
-Trust your gut.
-Yep. Always trust your gut.

09:00.707 --> 09:03.293
My gut says more tacos, please.

09:11.176 --> 09:12.845
Charles. Charles, stop!

09:15.973 --> 09:17.015
Finally.

09:17.099 --> 09:19.893
What do you wanna do now?
I know what I wanna do.

09:19.977 --> 09:22.813
No. I mean, stop putting on so much grass.

09:22.896 --> 09:25.691
I guess you didn't read
the one-page shortcut guide I gave you.

09:26.483 --> 09:30.362
Well, if you had, you'd know
to start with a thin layer of grass,

09:30.445 --> 09:33.073
then add a layer
of brown, organic material.

09:33.156 --> 09:37.077
Grass again, then brown.
Alternating, like lasagna.

09:37.160 --> 09:38.829
Lasagna sounds good.

09:38.912 --> 09:41.957
Wanna eat lunch and watch
AnimeZing Adventures of Lord Koh?

09:42.040 --> 09:44.668
-Lunch is for finishers.
-Can we at least take a break?

09:44.751 --> 09:46.879
You've been taking breaks
and spacing out all day!

09:46.962 --> 09:50.674
I'm not spacing out.
It's just composting is not that fun.

09:50.757 --> 09:52.176
How can you say that?

09:52.259 --> 09:57.181
We're taking society's leftovers
and creating a fertilizer so valuable,

09:57.264 --> 09:59.224
people call it black gold.

09:59.308 --> 10:02.895
Not to mention, composting pods
established in communal gardens

10:02.978 --> 10:05.522
have brought people
from all walks of life…

10:07.649 --> 10:10.485
Defending the universe is hungry work.

10:10.569 --> 10:14.907
Why don't we hop into your space cone
and find some intergalactic lasagna?

10:14.990 --> 10:16.909
You're spacing out right now.

10:18.202 --> 10:22.039
Sorry. It's just hard to get excited
about a bunch of dirt.

10:22.122 --> 10:23.707
A bunch of dirt?

10:24.708 --> 10:27.961
Look, Charles,
if you don't want to do this, don't.

10:28.045 --> 10:30.923
No, it's okay. Let's get back to work.

10:31.507 --> 10:35.427
But I might be thinking about Lord Koh
the entire time.

10:37.262 --> 10:41.099
So we really need to get rid of this.
Then we need to spread it out.

10:41.183 --> 10:43.435
-You sure you can't take him?
-I'm sorry.

10:43.519 --> 10:44.978
We're fully booked this weekend.

10:45.062 --> 10:49.107
Also, boarding reservations have to be
made at least 48 hours in advance.

10:49.191 --> 10:52.819
I have to get on this flight
last minute for work. I'm really in a jam.

10:52.903 --> 10:54.905
There's no way you can make an exception?

10:55.864 --> 10:57.574
I have to follow the rules.

10:58.492 --> 10:59.493
I'm sorry.

11:01.328 --> 11:04.957
Excuse me, Mr. von Smooshface?

11:05.040 --> 11:07.125
Just call me Maz, please.

11:07.209 --> 11:11.129
Maz, I heard what happened back there,
and I think I can help.

11:11.213 --> 11:13.173
You can change the rules?

11:13.257 --> 11:16.385
No, but my brother and I,
we foster dogs at our house.

11:16.468 --> 11:18.512
It's a hobby but we have references.

11:18.595 --> 11:21.014
And we'd love to watch Pugsley
for the weekend.

11:21.098 --> 11:24.351
You would be a lifesaver.
But are you sure?

11:24.434 --> 11:26.937
Like I said, he can be kind of a handful.

11:27.855 --> 11:29.064
This little sweetie?

11:30.065 --> 11:31.733
Trust me. We can handle it.

11:31.817 --> 11:33.443
I don't think I can handle this.

11:33.527 --> 11:35.779
I've tried toys, treats,
and the coziest blankets.

11:35.863 --> 11:38.657
No matter what,
whenever I put him down, he does this.

11:52.671 --> 11:57.301
I understand it at Bowser's, but here,
you have nothing to be sad about, Pugsley.

11:57.384 --> 11:58.594
We love you.

11:59.970 --> 12:02.347
Well, he sure looks happy now.

12:10.898 --> 12:12.649
Not so much now.

12:17.863 --> 12:19.781
I mean, it's nonstop.

12:19.865 --> 12:22.492
It's like the further I get,
the louder he gets.

12:22.576 --> 12:24.828
I can't carry you around all weekend, bud.

12:43.180 --> 12:44.181
Pugsley.

12:44.932 --> 12:46.141
This is my homework.

12:52.648 --> 12:53.649
What?

13:17.923 --> 13:19.758
I'm ready for my Pugsley shift.

13:19.842 --> 13:22.761
I figured out
why Pugsley's whining all the time.

13:22.845 --> 13:25.597
Pugsley has a really bad case of
separation anxiety.

13:25.681 --> 13:28.475
-He hates being alone.
-So, we should cuddle him more.

13:28.559 --> 13:31.186
Apparently,
that's exactly the wrong way to help him.

13:31.270 --> 13:34.690
How is cuddling ever wrong?

13:34.773 --> 13:37.734
Pugsley reminds me
of when you were a baby.

13:37.818 --> 13:39.570
You wouldn't go to sleep by yourself.

13:39.653 --> 13:43.657
You would cry and cry unless
someone stayed in the room with you.

13:43.740 --> 13:45.075
So, what'd you do?

13:45.158 --> 13:48.579
I would say good night and leave the room.
You'd cry for a while.

13:48.662 --> 13:51.748
I'd come back in, settle you down
and then leave again.

13:51.832 --> 13:53.375
We increased the time you were alone

13:53.458 --> 13:55.878
until you could fall asleep
and stay that way all night.

13:55.961 --> 13:58.839
That's exactly what this website says
to do for Pugsley.

13:58.922 --> 14:02.676
-They trained you like a dog.
-We did the same thing for you.

14:04.636 --> 14:08.056
Well, dogs are the best.

14:09.349 --> 14:11.393
Sounds like a good plan, honey.

14:12.311 --> 14:13.729
Should we start now?

14:16.523 --> 14:17.983
I think tomorrow.

14:22.905 --> 14:24.573
How's it going today?

14:24.656 --> 14:27.534
I don't know how many times
I've been in and out,

14:27.618 --> 14:29.036
but I think it's working.

14:35.000 --> 14:37.044
Pugsley seems calm and happy.

14:39.671 --> 14:42.549
He's been like that for two hours.

14:42.633 --> 14:45.802
I am always amazed
at how good you are with dogs.

14:45.886 --> 14:46.887
Thanks.

14:48.138 --> 14:50.098
I wish Bowser's felt the same.

15:05.030 --> 15:06.073
Sammy.

15:08.909 --> 15:10.911
I forgot to call you.

15:10.994 --> 15:13.997
I know. I had to do all of my work
and your work.

15:14.081 --> 15:17.251
I was helping Lizzie with Pugsley,
and I lost track of time.

15:17.334 --> 15:19.545
-You're sidekicking me.
-I didn't touch you.

15:19.628 --> 15:23.131
No. You're treating me like a sidekick.
I do whatever you want to do.

15:23.215 --> 15:27.302
But when it's something that I want to do,
suddenly it's not that important.

15:27.386 --> 15:29.638
You're Lord Koh,
and I'm just a ball of ice cream.

15:29.721 --> 15:32.182
I can't believe you're getting so mad
over a--

15:33.934 --> 15:35.227
Say it.

15:35.769 --> 15:37.145
A bunch of dirt.

15:37.229 --> 15:39.398
I didn't say it. You did.

15:39.481 --> 15:40.983
You know what? Forget it.

15:41.066 --> 15:44.278
From now on, I'm the hero,
and you're gonna be the sidekick.

15:44.361 --> 15:46.822
The hero of what?

15:46.905 --> 15:49.116
The presentation. I'm gonna do it myself.

15:49.199 --> 15:51.410
-But then what will I do?
-I don't know.

15:51.493 --> 15:53.829
Watch the new season
of AnimeZing Adventures?

15:53.912 --> 15:55.205
I just finished it.

16:08.844 --> 16:11.221
I'm gonna miss you.

16:11.805 --> 16:12.931
Hey.

16:13.682 --> 16:16.435
You really did a great job with Pugsley.

16:17.144 --> 16:18.896
He seems a lot happier.

16:19.396 --> 16:21.732
Yeah, he does seem a lot better.

16:22.232 --> 16:24.318
Maz is coming to get him this afternoon.

16:24.401 --> 16:26.486
Is it okay if I pick him up now?

16:27.863 --> 16:28.864
Sure.

16:36.121 --> 16:38.957
I wish you could get Sammy
to stop whining too.

16:41.001 --> 16:45.088
I forgot to go to his house one time
to work on our service week project.

16:45.172 --> 16:46.924
And now he's mad at me!

16:47.508 --> 16:51.011
You mean the project
he's letting you work on as a favor?

16:53.138 --> 16:56.183
I know.
But I don't really care about composting.

16:56.266 --> 16:58.644
And he was gonna do it by himself anyway.

16:58.727 --> 17:01.396
So, why is it such a big deal?

17:01.480 --> 17:06.151
Because it's important to him,
the same way anime's important to you.

17:06.734 --> 17:10.321
Anime is so much better than dirt.

17:11.823 --> 17:15.786
Look, Charles. Sammy always tries
to be interested in whatever you like.

17:15.868 --> 17:18.247
So, why can't you do the same for him?

17:18.997 --> 17:21.458
I mean, he is your best friend.

17:27.047 --> 17:29.591
It's for you.
I'll be ready to go in a minute.

17:30.342 --> 17:31.844
Hi, Maz. How's Pugsley?

17:31.927 --> 17:34.972
Lizzie,
do you have any idea what you've done?

17:35.055 --> 17:39.893
I told you. I just did some training
to help him with his separation anxiety.

17:39.977 --> 17:42.855
Not for Pugsley, for me.
I work from home,

17:42.938 --> 17:46.775
and I could never get anything done
because Pugsley was so needy.

17:46.859 --> 17:48.569
That's why I took him to Bowser's.

17:48.652 --> 17:51.196
Now you've made both of our lives
so much better!

17:51.780 --> 17:54.825
That's great.
I can't wait to see you guys at Bowser's.

17:54.908 --> 17:57.035
Oh, no, we're not going back to Bowser's.

17:57.119 --> 18:00.205
-Wait. What?
-Yeah, we don't need Bowser's anymore.

18:00.289 --> 18:03.834
I mean, it's way better for him
to be home with his dad.

18:03.917 --> 18:06.420
Anyway, Lizzie, we gotta run.

18:06.503 --> 18:09.047
Thank you again
for everything you've done.

18:09.131 --> 18:12.009
You really know your stuff. Bye.

18:13.969 --> 18:17.347
-He sounded really happy.
-Well, Ruth's gonna be really mad.

18:17.431 --> 18:19.474
So much for my career at Bowser's.

18:19.558 --> 18:21.977
And I'm gonna get a bad evaluation
for service week.

18:22.060 --> 18:24.771
-Why?
-Because I lost them a customer.

18:24.855 --> 18:28.567
-I told you, Charles. It's a business.
-Yeah, but it's a dog business.

18:28.650 --> 18:32.279
And service week is supposed to be
about helping the community, right?

18:32.362 --> 18:34.448
Pugsley's part of the community too.

18:34.531 --> 18:37.951
And you helped him.
Doesn't that mean you're good at business?

18:38.702 --> 18:43.498
I don't think it does.
But you did make me feel a little better.

18:43.582 --> 18:46.168
Well, you've done it once or twice
for me, so…

18:46.251 --> 18:48.712
Okay, you two. Let's go.

18:54.760 --> 18:57.262
So, what's with all the bags?

18:58.555 --> 19:01.350
We can't both fail service week.

19:04.770 --> 19:09.316
And so, while many people
may see compost as just a pile of dirt,

19:09.399 --> 19:11.735
something you step on
and don't really think about,

19:11.818 --> 19:17.241
the truly wise understand its value
as a friend to the earth and to all of us.

19:18.367 --> 19:22.246
Charles, this is a joint project
and you failed to speak.

19:22.329 --> 19:25.958
-Notice the emphasis on--
-Actually, I do have something to say.

19:26.041 --> 19:28.335
I learned a lot working on this project.

19:28.418 --> 19:31.421
Like,
composting returns nutrients to our soil.

19:31.505 --> 19:34.675
And that's what makes vegetables
so good for you.

19:34.758 --> 19:35.759
Not only that,

19:35.843 --> 19:39.555
it pulls carbon out of the atmosphere
to help slow down climate change.

19:39.638 --> 19:43.600
And maybe that doesn't sound exciting,
but it's important.

19:43.684 --> 19:44.893
And that's cool.

19:45.936 --> 19:48.981
Also, Sammy and I made these for everyone.

19:49.064 --> 19:51.733
It's a starter jar of compost
with instructions,

19:51.817 --> 19:54.736
so each one of you can be a hero
in your own yard.

19:56.989 --> 19:58.615
How did you know all that?

19:58.699 --> 20:00.826
The one-page shortcut guide you gave me.

20:00.909 --> 20:02.661
Really? You read it?

20:06.623 --> 20:07.708
This is so great.

20:08.917 --> 20:12.212
-Wait, is the paper biodegradable?
-Don't push it, Sammy.

20:19.928 --> 20:22.139
Lizzie. I'd like a word with you.

20:22.222 --> 20:24.474
Can I just say something really quick?

20:24.558 --> 20:29.062
I am so sorry that I disobeyed the rules
and you lost a client because of it.

20:29.146 --> 20:32.441
-That's what I want to talk to you about.
-My only defense is,

20:32.524 --> 20:37.613
I didn't volunteer because I like dogs.
I volunteered because I love dogs.

20:38.822 --> 20:42.492
I looked up Emma Bowser, and I found out
that's why she started her business.

20:42.576 --> 20:45.370
Her favorite quote was,
"Find a job you love,

20:45.454 --> 20:48.123
and you'll never
have to work a day in your life."

20:48.207 --> 20:49.458
Yeah.

20:49.541 --> 20:52.836
See, that's why I opened my own Bowser's.
I love dogs too.

20:53.420 --> 20:55.631
But what about Maz and Pugsley?

20:56.215 --> 21:00.802
Well, as it turns out, Maz gave us
the most wonderful online review.

21:00.886 --> 21:04.515
He said that the Bowser's team went
"above and beyond the call of duty."

21:04.598 --> 21:06.683
Our phones have been ringing off the hook.

21:08.477 --> 21:11.188
Does that mean I get a good evaluation?

21:12.439 --> 21:15.359
More than that. You're getting an apology.

21:16.443 --> 21:17.653
For what?

21:17.736 --> 21:19.863
Well, for underestimating you.

21:19.947 --> 21:23.534
I was too focused on the rules
to see that you know more about dogs

21:23.617 --> 21:25.410
than most adults I've worked with.

21:26.161 --> 21:27.871
And you didn't just help Pugsley.

21:27.955 --> 21:32.209
You helped me realize that I'd like
to make a few changes around here.

21:36.421 --> 21:39.883
Hi. I'm Ruth from Bowser's Backyard.

21:39.967 --> 21:43.387
In addition to our staff
of highly trained employees,

21:43.470 --> 21:46.515
Bowser's now has a community of volunteers

21:46.598 --> 21:51.854
lending their personal touch
to keeping your dog happy, safe and loved.

21:51.937 --> 21:54.857
So come to Bowser's Backyard,
where we're not just a business,

21:54.940 --> 21:56.650
we're a part of your community.
