It's good to see you again.

07:52.333 --> 07:54.500
-You know this woman?
-Yeah, we...

07:54.583 --> 07:56.875
went on a date,
like, seven years ago.

07:56.959 --> 07:59.667
Called her a bunch of times,
she never called me back.

07:59.750 --> 08:03.417
Yeah, that's...
kind of why I'm here now.

08:12.250 --> 08:17.083
What I'm about to tell you
is gonna be a lot to take in.

08:17.166 --> 08:19.917
Well, a girl who blew me off
seven years ago

08:20.041 --> 08:22.500
just hijacked my shuttle
in a stolen freighter,

08:22.583 --> 08:25.083
so consider me warmed up.

08:25.166 --> 08:28.208
Are you at all familiar
with the starship<i> Orville? </i>

08:28.291 --> 08:30.333
That's the ship the Kaylon used

08:30.417 --> 08:32.291
to get through
Earth's defenses, right?

08:32.375 --> 08:34.667
Yeah.

08:34.750 --> 08:36.709
We were all supposed
to be aboard.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.709
What do you mean
"supposed to be"?

08:39.792 --> 08:41.667
You were supposed
to be the captain.

08:41.750 --> 08:43.709
I was supposed to be
your first officer.

08:43.792 --> 08:45.542
Everyone here
was part of your crew.

08:45.625 --> 08:47.291
ED:
(chuckles) Okay,
well, that's a...

08:47.375 --> 08:48.792
much more appealing
version of events,

08:48.875 --> 08:51.000
but it's... it's not reality.

08:51.083 --> 08:53.875
Yes, it is.
In an alternate timeline.

08:53.959 --> 08:55.667
Is this, like, one of those
crack house ships

08:55.750 --> 08:56.917
I've been hearing about?

08:57.000 --> 09:00.083
Wait, how would you know
about an alternate timeline?

09:00.166 --> 09:01.750
Seven years ago

09:01.834 --> 09:03.959
I was accidentally
sent forward in time

09:04.041 --> 09:05.792
to what would've been
six months ago.

09:05.875 --> 09:08.667
I was aboard the<i> Orville. </i>

09:08.750 --> 09:10.208
I saw you there,

09:10.291 --> 09:13.208
along with everyone else
in this room.

09:13.291 --> 09:15.834
Before the<i> Orville </i>
returned me to my own time,

09:15.917 --> 09:19.166
Dr. Finn gave me a memory wipe,
but it didn't work.

09:20.750 --> 09:24.625
And I ended up doing something
that changed history.

09:24.709 --> 09:25.917
What?

09:26.000 --> 09:28.125
I said no to a second date.

09:28.208 --> 09:29.750
Huh?

09:29.834 --> 09:32.625
In the other timeline,
we got married.

09:32.709 --> 09:35.542
Long story short, I had
an affair, we got divorced.

09:35.625 --> 09:38.750
Out of guilt, I helped get you
command of the<i> Orville. </i>

09:38.834 --> 09:41.000
And, because you were captain...

09:41.083 --> 09:43.208
the Kaylon were defeated.

09:43.291 --> 09:45.709
-Because I was captain?
-Yes.

09:45.792 --> 09:47.625
-I stopped the Kaylon?
-Right.

09:47.709 --> 09:50.041
I had to swim with my shirt on
until I was 20.

09:50.125 --> 09:51.291
KELLY:
Just listen.

09:51.375 --> 09:53.166
Because you were in command
of the<i> Orville, </i>

09:53.250 --> 09:54.667
Dr. Finn signed on.

09:54.750 --> 09:57.375
I always like to be posted
where I'm needed.

09:57.458 --> 09:59.625
Apparently, I felt
you could use my help.

09:59.709 --> 10:01.834
She and her sons
had a relationship

10:01.917 --> 10:03.667
with the Kaylon emissary Isaac.

10:03.750 --> 10:05.083
That relationship
is what got him

10:05.166 --> 10:06.792
to turn against his own people.

10:06.875 --> 10:08.542
The Kaylon lost the battle.

10:09.792 --> 10:10.667
And you all believe this?

10:10.750 --> 10:12.458
TALLA:
It's not hard to believe.

10:12.542 --> 10:14.208
I served on the<i> Orville </i>
with Captain Griffith,

10:14.291 --> 10:16.000
and we all thought
Isaac was our friend.

10:16.083 --> 10:18.208
Kelly tracked
every one of us down.

10:18.291 --> 10:19.709
And the things she knew--

10:19.792 --> 10:21.291
no one could've known
unless they'd been there.

10:21.375 --> 10:23.291
KELLY:
Ed,

10:23.375 --> 10:25.291
we have to try
and restore the timeline.

10:25.375 --> 10:27.875
And the only way to do that
is for me to go back

10:27.959 --> 10:29.834
and correct the memory wipe.

10:29.917 --> 10:33.208
Half the known galaxy
wiped out by those people...

10:33.291 --> 10:35.834
-because we didn't go out again.
-GORDON: Wait, wait, wait, wait.

10:35.917 --> 10:37.709
E-Even if all of this were true,

10:37.792 --> 10:39.500
and there were a way
to go back--

10:39.583 --> 10:40.792
and that's a lot of ifs--

10:40.875 --> 10:42.750
what if the memory wipe
fails again?

10:42.834 --> 10:44.125
I mean, w-we're right back
in hell.

10:44.208 --> 10:45.667
CLAIRE:
The reason it didn't work

10:45.750 --> 10:47.041
is that Kelly's brain
is deficient

10:47.125 --> 10:49.041
in a protein called
beta-secretase.

10:49.125 --> 10:51.000
It's something that could've
easily been missed,

10:51.083 --> 10:52.667
and apparently
that's what happened.

10:52.750 --> 10:55.500
With the proper injection,
the memory wipe will take hold,

10:55.583 --> 10:57.458
and history will be restored.

10:57.542 --> 10:59.500
Every sickbay in the Union
is in pieces.

10:59.583 --> 11:01.041
Can you replicate this protein?

11:01.125 --> 11:02.667
No.

11:02.750 --> 11:04.750
There's an underground.

11:04.834 --> 11:06.625
A resistance
to the Kaylon expansion.

11:06.709 --> 11:08.709
Yeah, I know about
the resistance.

11:08.792 --> 11:10.250
-Thought they'd been destroyed.
-Yeah,

11:10.333 --> 11:11.709
that's what they wanted
the Kaylon to think,

11:11.792 --> 11:13.458
but there are still
a handful of cells.

11:13.542 --> 11:15.750
I have a contact in one of them.

11:15.834 --> 11:18.250
-They can get us
a dose of the protein.
-And then what?

11:18.333 --> 11:20.250
One thing at a time.

11:20.333 --> 11:21.875
The resistance base is remote,

11:21.959 --> 11:24.667
and we're gonna have to avoid
a lot of Kaylon.

11:24.750 --> 11:25.959
We'll need a good pilot.

11:27.208 --> 11:29.291

the helm?

11:29.375 --> 11:30.500
Come on.

11:38.375 --> 11:40.834

I'm sorry.

11:40.917 --> 11:43.834
I saw...

11:43.917 --> 11:45.834
us.

11:45.917 --> 11:47.834
You and I.

11:47.917 --> 11:50.542
We'd been through so much pain
and heartbreak,

11:50.625 --> 11:53.417
and to be an observer
from the outside...

11:55.500 --> 11:57.792
I only did what
I thought was right.

11:57.875 --> 11:59.583
To protect us both.

11:59.667 --> 12:02.583
Oh, that's a hell of a decision
to make all on your own.

12:02.667 --> 12:04.375
If you saw your own future

12:04.458 --> 12:06.417
and all the mistakes you made...

12:06.500 --> 12:08.125
wouldn't you try to fix it?

12:08.208 --> 12:10.875
I might consider how it would
affect other people.

12:10.959 --> 12:12.917
Come on, you took temporal law
at Union Point.

12:13.000 --> 12:15.125
You go back in time, you kill
Hitler, you stop World War II,

12:15.208 --> 12:16.625
you don't know what'll happen.

12:16.709 --> 12:17.959
You could make things worse.

12:19.625 --> 12:21.542
I know that now.

12:28.041 --> 12:29.875
And then when you
basically ghosted me,

12:32.875 --> 12:34.834
