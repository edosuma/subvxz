WEBVTT

00:12.053 --> 00:16.808
...painfully evident
that zombies and humans do not mix.

00:16.891 --> 00:19.853
Okay. Just so I'm following
your logic, Councilman.

00:20.854 --> 00:23.940
Because humans and zombies,
as you say, do not mix,

00:24.023 --> 00:27.902
the appropriate response
is for the mayor to fire this bus driver?

00:27.986 --> 00:29.195
This zombie bus driver.

00:29.279 --> 00:31.072
You know the union's position.

00:31.364 --> 00:34.576
First of all, they've got no proof that
Mr. Harrison is a zombie.

00:34.659 --> 00:36.161
Of course, he is! Look at him!

00:36.536 --> 00:38.413
Every day he becomes more belligerent.

00:38.496 --> 00:39.998
Last week he snapped at me!

00:40.081 --> 00:41.082
With his teeth?

00:41.166 --> 00:43.334
Well, no, for not having correct change.

00:43.585 --> 00:47.297
Look, my constituents rely on this route.

00:47.380 --> 00:49.591
Mr. Harrison has an
exemplary service record.

00:49.674 --> 00:52.260
What you're asking
is tantamount to discrimination.

00:53.094 --> 00:54.888
This is not how this city operates.

00:55.180 --> 00:58.349
Fillmore-Graves has mandated
no one gets fired for being a zombie.

01:00.018 --> 01:01.811
This will end badly. Come on.

01:04.731 --> 01:06.608
Mr. Harrison. Can I, can I have a minute?

01:06.858 --> 01:08.068
I'm sorry, just give us a sec.

01:09.194 --> 01:12.530
Uh, forgive me, Mr. Harrison, but...

01:13.198 --> 01:14.949
You're looking a little malnourished.

01:16.451 --> 01:17.660
Are you getting enough to eat?

01:18.078 --> 01:19.412
We get what they give us.

01:19.704 --> 01:21.581
Brain tubes don't go
as far as they used to.

01:21.915 --> 01:25.752
-Me, my wife, our kids.

01:30.965 --> 01:32.050
Give me your address.

01:33.551 --> 01:36.554
I'll, uh, make sure extra rations are
delivered to you and your family.

01:39.557 --> 01:41.017
No whammy.

01:42.101 --> 01:43.603
No whammy.

01:43.686 --> 01:45.438
No whammy.

01:46.606 --> 01:48.441
No whammy.

01:49.984 --> 01:51.778
Oh! Cows on my side!

01:55.448 --> 01:58.660
When are we stopping, Majey
I'm having a snack attack.

01:58.743 --> 01:59.911
We're not stopping.

01:59.994 --> 02:01.746
We've been on the road for hours.

02:01.830 --> 02:04.582
You know you're not in charge here.
This is a joint operation.

02:05.834 --> 02:07.210
Lighten up, <i>Mejor!</i>

02:07.293 --> 02:09.546
Look at us! We're out of the city.

02:09.629 --> 02:12.966
Open road, wind in our hair.

02:13.883 --> 02:16.010
If you can't enjoy the little things,
I don't know what to tell you.

02:17.428 --> 02:19.013
Punch-buggy green, no punch back.

02:21.099 --> 02:22.183
Ow!

02:23.351 --> 02:25.019
I said no punch back.

02:26.104 --> 02:28.064
Let me out, please!

02:28.273 --> 02:31.317
Hey! Let me out!

02:31.401 --> 02:32.694
Help me!

02:32.944 --> 02:35.238
Let me out! Help me!

03:02.557 --> 03:06.352
The bodies were stuffed into the trunk
of an old LTD at the wrecker's.

03:06.686 --> 03:09.314
A junkyard dog found them
before the cars were demolished.

03:10.857 --> 03:14.903
So, the bodies were moved
from the original crime scene.

03:15.111 --> 03:19.782
Unless they stuffed themselves
into the car trunk at the junkyard and

03:19.866 --> 03:21.367
waited to get shot.

03:21.451 --> 03:23.745
Well, that seems like a long shot, Clive.

03:23.995 --> 03:25.079
Hmm.

03:28.708 --> 03:30.752
Three zombies, one human.

03:31.336 --> 03:34.839
All four of them shot in the head.

03:35.465 --> 03:37.884
Ah, a hate crime.

03:38.218 --> 03:41.095
Most likely the work of the Dead Enders.

03:42.013 --> 03:44.974
The human was, how you say?

03:45.225 --> 03:47.060
<i>Dommage collat√©ral. </i>

03:47.143 --> 03:49.562
That's not how I say it.

03:49.646 --> 03:52.315
This reads like
a professional hit, Inspector.

03:52.398 --> 03:55.026
The Dead Enders
are Molotov cocktail-tossing street punks.

03:56.402 --> 03:57.779
<i>Bien non, </i>Babineaux.

03:57.862 --> 04:03.243
They are adapting, learning,
thinking outside the proverbial box.

04:03.743 --> 04:06.829
If only the Seattle Police Department

04:06.913 --> 04:08.873
were capable of the same.

04:08.957 --> 04:13.253
My men will come shortly
to retrieve the three zombie bodies.

04:13.336 --> 04:15.838
<i>-Adieu.</i>
-Oh, uh, don't you wanna wait

04:15.922 --> 04:17.548
until we've completed the, uh...

04:17.966 --> 04:21.803
How you say, uh, examination postmortem?

04:22.512 --> 04:26.015
You believe Enzo Lambert
requires your assistance?

04:27.308 --> 04:29.102
<i>Quel amusant.</i>

04:30.103 --> 04:33.690
Crimes against zombies
are under Fillmore-Graves' jurisdiction,

04:33.773 --> 04:35.024
as you well know.

04:35.400 --> 04:37.360
We will conduct our own autopsy.

04:38.820 --> 04:42.240
Keep 'em taters
for me till then, eh, old chap?

04:44.284 --> 04:45.451
<i>Au revoir.</i>

04:47.370 --> 04:48.454
I hate that guy.

04:48.621 --> 04:49.622
What's on the menu?

04:50.707 --> 04:52.125
Gordie Schultz.

04:52.834 --> 04:54.794
We were able to pin Gordie down

04:54.877 --> 04:57.171
thanks to his unique dental records.

04:58.089 --> 04:59.590
He's missing his front teeth.

04:59.674 --> 05:01.551
How does that happen to a guy his age?

05:03.428 --> 05:04.470
Let me show you.

05:09.934 --> 05:12.895
-It's a highlight reel of sorts.

05:13.646 --> 05:15.273
You're going to be a hockey player, Liv.

05:15.356 --> 05:17.734
He's not a hockey player, he's a felon.

05:18.192 --> 05:19.402
He's a goon.

05:20.153 --> 05:21.738
You're going to be a goon, Liv.

05:22.822 --> 05:24.240
I didn't know Seattle had a team.

05:24.324 --> 05:27.577
Minor league team, the Sockeyes.
And we don't anymore.

05:27.660 --> 05:30.830
They were booted from their league
once Seattle became zombie-town.

05:31.831 --> 05:35.626
Lucky for us, they still practice
and play exhibition games all the time.

05:35.710 --> 05:36.961
They're on the ice tomorrow.

05:37.045 --> 05:39.505
We'll head down there
and see if Gordie's old team

05:39.589 --> 05:41.424
can shed some light on
what might've gotten him killed.

05:41.507 --> 05:43.885
Oh, we're not going to
talk to his family first?

05:45.470 --> 05:48.514
Oh, did I forget to mention?
Gordie's not from here.

05:49.849 --> 05:50.850
Where's he from?

05:51.601 --> 05:54.812
North Battleford, Saskatchewan, Canada.

05:59.025 --> 06:01.861
What are you doing, Clive?
Stop. Stop that.

06:02.153 --> 06:03.696
Take off, you hoser.

06:03.780 --> 06:05.573
Fry up that brain like back bacon,

06:05.656 --> 06:07.825
and wash it down
with a couple of wobbly pops,

06:07.909 --> 06:09.577
and let's get to the rink, eh?

06:14.791 --> 06:18.503
Okay, Liv. I think Clive
is cruisin' for a bruisin'.

06:42.819 --> 06:44.112
Make it quick.

06:44.612 --> 06:46.656
Aye, aye, Corporal. You need anything?

06:46.739 --> 06:48.908
Protein shake

06:58.584 --> 07:02.338
Be a dove and toss in a bottle of that
Hella Hot Hooch whiskey, too, would you?

07:02.421 --> 07:03.548
I've earned it.

07:03.840 --> 07:06.634
-Just need to see our ID, hon.
-Ha!

07:07.176 --> 07:08.594
No ID, no sale.

07:09.971 --> 07:12.473
Yo! Don't test me, you daffy old bat!

07:19.313 --> 07:21.441
You bet.

07:36.164 --> 07:38.291
We're just trying to learn more
about Gordie's life.

07:39.667 --> 07:41.711
Anything you can think of
that'll help us understand

07:41.794 --> 07:43.629
who he was off the ice.

07:44.714 --> 07:45.548
Hmm?

07:48.301 --> 07:49.302
Nothing?

07:49.385 --> 07:52.805
Sorry, Detective.
Schultzie pretty much kept to himself.

07:52.889 --> 07:55.057
I mean, he wasn't
the sharpest skate in the shed.

07:55.892 --> 07:57.310
Oh, sorry.

07:57.768 --> 07:59.187
But he was as nice as they come.

07:59.270 --> 08:03.274
Levon's right, Schultzie was a beaut.
Hell of a teammate.

08:03.649 --> 08:05.943
Let's light some lamps
out there, eh, boys?

08:06.903 --> 08:07.987
Play as a team!

08:08.362 --> 08:11.949
Did he ever have any issues
with painkillers or harder drugs?

08:12.825 --> 08:14.327
That's our friend you're chirpin'.

08:15.328 --> 08:18.998
Hey! He's trying to solve
your teammate's murder, you plug.

08:19.081 --> 08:20.500
Why don't you quit stonewalling?

08:22.001 --> 08:23.711
All right, take it easy.

08:24.504 --> 08:27.089
It's time, boys!
Don't forget to watch your language,

08:27.173 --> 08:28.299
there's kids out there!

08:34.889 --> 08:36.682
Blow it out your ass, dillhole.

08:40.061 --> 08:41.312
They know something.

08:41.521 --> 08:44.232
Agreed. Not much
we can do about it though.

08:44.315 --> 08:45.691
We can't make them talk.

09:21.477 --> 09:24.188
They're so cute. Which one's yours?

09:25.022 --> 09:26.315
Hmm.

09:27.942 --> 09:29.151
The little blonde one.

09:30.361 --> 09:31.195
Ooh.

09:56.596 --> 09:59.348
-I don't know.

10:00.474 --> 10:02.852
That didn't feel like fan appreciation!

10:05.187 --> 10:08.274
Excuse me. Sorry. Excuse me.
Sorry. Excuse me.

10:08.357 --> 10:09.900
Oh, hell...

10:10.484 --> 10:12.903
Yes! Thanks for texting me.

10:12.987 --> 10:15.156
-Never.

10:22.163 --> 10:22.997
Oh...

10:33.174 --> 10:36.093
-You're cruising.

10:36.177 --> 10:38.054
-Let's do it. Let's go.

10:38.137 --> 10:39.430
Let's do it, chump change.

10:39.972 --> 10:41.223
It's on. Look.

10:41.307 --> 10:42.391
Oh, you think you can handle it?

10:42.475 --> 10:43.768
Show me what you got, peewee.

10:46.395 --> 10:47.647
You're gutless, fours.

10:48.564 --> 10:50.900
You won't go me,
you won't tell me about Gordie...

10:51.525 --> 10:54.487
Why don't you give
your gitch a tug, meatbag.

10:59.075 --> 11:00.576
Keep your stick on the ice, kid.

11:09.293 --> 11:10.127
Ooh...

11:10.670 --> 11:12.171
Ooh, ooh, ooh.

11:24.850 --> 11:26.060
Got enough, huh?

11:34.819 --> 11:37.738
Yeah, I fought Gordie. More than once.

11:37.947 --> 11:41.409
But I was already convicted
and served my sentence.

11:42.034 --> 11:43.661
Five minutes and a game misconduct.

11:43.744 --> 11:45.162
But you were teammates.

11:46.914 --> 11:50.626
I'm, I'm sorry, I'm having
a hard time taking you seriously.

11:50.709 --> 11:52.962
I'd try harder if I were you, Mr. Patch.

11:53.045 --> 11:54.463
Yeah, we were teammates.

11:54.547 --> 11:56.882
But not when Gordie played for Portland.

11:57.299 --> 11:59.301
After he was traded to Seattle,
we were good,

11:59.385 --> 12:01.762
and I was probably
his closest friend on the team.

12:04.140 --> 12:07.476
That fight happened three years ago.
How'd you even hear about that?

12:07.560 --> 12:09.728
It's, uh, it's a known fact.

12:09.812 --> 12:12.148
Witness accounts.
Multiple sources.

12:27.037 --> 12:29.039
I've met better liars in my time.

12:30.040 --> 12:31.083
Oh!

12:33.961 --> 12:36.422
I think he knows I ate Gordie's brain.

12:37.256 --> 12:39.675
I've had whole brain. I know how it works.

12:39.758 --> 12:43.179
Plus, you play just like Schultzie.
It wasn't hard to piece together.

12:43.262 --> 12:45.598
There were three zombies
killed with Gordie.

12:45.681 --> 12:47.141
All of them shot in the head.

12:47.766 --> 12:50.186
The Fillmore-Graves investigator thinks
it was a hate crime.

12:50.269 --> 12:51.770
Any of that mean anything to you?

12:52.813 --> 12:54.106
It's as good a theory as any.

12:54.190 --> 12:55.524
You say Gordie was your friend,

12:55.608 --> 12:57.526
but you act like
you don't care who killed him.

12:57.610 --> 13:00.738
Oh, I care.
But this is New Seattle we live in.

13:00.821 --> 13:02.239
-It's Chinatown.

13:02.573 --> 13:04.033
-Huh.

13:04.700 --> 13:05.701
Yup.

13:13.250 --> 13:14.960
-Chinatown.

13:17.671 --> 13:18.797
What does that mean?

13:19.423 --> 13:20.466
It's like the movie.

13:21.342 --> 13:22.885
The line speaks to the futility of

13:22.968 --> 13:25.262
obtaining justice
in an inherently corrupt system.

13:26.138 --> 13:28.307
Oh. Huh.

13:29.767 --> 13:31.143
I still don't get it.

13:33.979 --> 13:35.022
Goon brain.

13:36.357 --> 13:39.735
General Mills has been
on every network this week

13:39.818 --> 13:42.029
promoting his "Seattle Solution."

13:42.238 --> 13:44.698
Polling is starting to swing in his favor.

13:47.910 --> 13:50.871
We need to take this threat
very seriously.

13:51.455 --> 13:53.707
He wants to nuke Seattle, Chase.

13:55.167 --> 13:57.253
I've got the General Mills
situation under control.

13:59.171 --> 14:00.172
Anything else?

14:05.344 --> 14:08.764
Rumor has it that you've
captured the smuggler known as "Renegade."

14:09.181 --> 14:12.393
Is that true?
If so, why haven't you told us about it?

14:12.726 --> 14:16.855
It does seem like something
you might've mentioned.

14:32.454 --> 14:33.831
Zombie jail?

14:39.962 --> 14:41.964
What

14:45.384 --> 14:46.594
You're a good man.

14:46.844 --> 14:52.474
Maybe once I'm unfrozen, Seattle will be
a zombie-human utopia,

14:52.558 --> 14:56.353
and there'll be statues
of Chase Graves in every city park.

14:56.896 --> 15:01.233
For he was the
George Washington of the undead.

15:03.652 --> 15:06.196
Or maybe you'll wake up
because the power grid is down

15:06.822 --> 15:09.074
and there's no one left alive
to turn it back on.

15:15.414 --> 15:16.707
Yes, I have Renegade.

15:19.919 --> 15:24.048
-Because Renegade is a little old lady.

15:24.840 --> 15:26.175
And where I come from,

15:26.258 --> 15:30.095
smashing open the skull of a little
old lady is considered bad manners.

15:30.596 --> 15:32.097
Not to mention bad optics.

15:32.431 --> 15:36.852
Renegade? Hmm. A little old lady...

15:36.936 --> 15:38.646
-Not that old.

15:39.396 --> 15:41.357
But that's how the public will see it.

15:41.565 --> 15:45.444
You decreed the creation
of new zombies a capital offense.

15:45.527 --> 15:49.573
If we do not execute Renegade, that decree

15:50.658 --> 15:51.659
is meaningless.

15:52.534 --> 15:55.621
-It does.

15:58.290 --> 16:00.876
I don't envy your position, Commander.

16:01.293 --> 16:04.588
That said,
you're going about this all wrong.

16:05.214 --> 16:06.423
Please, enlighten me.

16:06.799 --> 16:09.510
You are having a public relations problem.

16:09.677 --> 16:13.263
Oh? I thought I was having
feeding-thousands-of-zombies problems.

16:14.682 --> 16:19.603
When you're asking your fellow Americans
to donate their brains for our cause...

16:20.396 --> 16:21.814
Optics matter.

16:23.107 --> 16:24.692
Saving human lives.

16:25.943 --> 16:27.861
Now, that's good optics.

16:28.112 --> 16:29.697
So, that's why you broke the law?

16:31.073 --> 16:33.575
You're just a zombie patriot
looking to provide better optics?

16:33.659 --> 16:34.868
No, Chase.

16:35.577 --> 16:39.498
I broke the law
because it feels good to save lives,

16:40.165 --> 16:42.167
it feels good to reunite families.

16:42.251 --> 16:44.294
It feels humane.

16:51.301 --> 16:53.053
You should try it sometime.

17:06.358 --> 17:07.776
Renegade is in prison.

17:07.860 --> 17:09.778
We only have
one option here, sir.

17:09.862 --> 17:12.281
-Once word gets out--
-That's where she'll stay.

17:26.920 --> 17:28.589
It's okay, I've got it!

17:29.423 --> 17:32.801
Save your strength for the CrossFit Games.

17:32.885 --> 17:35.471
Shut up. I'm trying to find out
if anyone's reported her missing yet.

17:40.059 --> 17:41.226
-Ow!

17:41.310 --> 17:42.436
What's wrong with you?

17:43.687 --> 17:47.524
Do you know who I am
Do you know who my father is?

17:48.817 --> 17:51.111
I know exactly who you are, Sloane.

17:51.236 --> 17:52.571
Put the gun away, Don E.

17:59.995 --> 18:01.288
My wrists hurt.

18:04.374 --> 18:05.375
Can you untie me?

18:06.752 --> 18:07.795
Please.

18:12.549 --> 18:13.425
Ah!

18:13.550 --> 18:14.676
Damn it!

18:14.760 --> 18:16.762
<i>Earlier today at an Arcade gas station,</i>

18:16.845 --> 18:19.139
<i>170 miles south of New Seattle...</i>

18:19.223 --> 18:22.309
<i>You're claiming this was a zombie attack?</i>

18:22.476 --> 18:24.311
<i>His eyes went red, </i>

18:24.561 --> 18:26.730
<i>just like in those YouTube videos. </i>

18:27.272 --> 18:29.108
<i>Oh, he was a squirrelly little runt.</i>

18:29.191 --> 18:31.151
<i>And now exclusive footage</i>
<i>of the incident.</i>

18:34.196 --> 18:36.240
<i>-While visibly shaken...</i>
Oh, my God!

18:36.990 --> 18:39.993
<i>-If you've seen this man, please...</i>

18:40.911 --> 18:44.164
Don E., what the hell did you do?

18:50.170 --> 18:53.841
Really? All you had to do was
get your food and not go into rage mode.

18:53.924 --> 18:57.594
Forgive me! It's called having emotions.
You should try it sometime.

18:57.678 --> 19:00.055
You realize half the cops in the state
are probably out looking for us right now?

19:00.139 --> 19:02.224
We still have an hour
before your smuggling contacts get here.

19:02.307 --> 19:05.269
You saw that old bat.
She's the kind of redneck

19:05.352 --> 19:07.271
who claims aliens probed her.

19:07.354 --> 19:08.939
There's video, Don E.!

19:14.570 --> 19:17.698
So, uh... Do you still
have some of that whiskey?

19:17.781 --> 19:19.116
No.

19:19.199 --> 19:21.451
Even if I did, it'd be
my whiskey, wouldn't it?

19:21.535 --> 19:22.870
Please...

19:23.620 --> 19:26.039
I'd been partying hard
all night when you grabbed me.

19:26.748 --> 19:29.543
I've have like, no serotonin in me.

19:29.668 --> 19:31.879
What can I tell you?
Make better life choices next time.

19:32.045 --> 19:34.089
Next time I get kidnapped?

19:34.548 --> 19:37.217
Come on, you must have something
that'll take the edge off.

19:37.301 --> 19:40.470
No. Go to sleep or something.
Dream you're someplace else.

19:41.054 --> 19:42.306
Now, there's an idea.

19:44.600 --> 19:47.603
Wake me when your people show up.
Keep an eye on her.

19:48.353 --> 19:50.147
What are you guys planning to do with me?

19:53.859 --> 19:57.154
Our dental plan is brutal.
You know how much a new Chiclet costs?

20:02.201 --> 20:03.535
Keep your head down, Chaksie.

20:04.453 --> 20:08.207
I think it's a great look, personally.
But if you insist on getting it fixed,

20:08.916 --> 20:11.376
there are several mouthfuls
of free Chiclets in these drawers.

20:12.669 --> 20:13.670
Head down, you say?

20:24.723 --> 20:25.724
You okay, Liv? It was Blaine.

20:28.602 --> 20:30.062
Blaine killed Gordie.

20:30.520 --> 20:32.272
-For the most part.

20:32.356 --> 20:34.816
He killed at least
one of Enzo's zombie victims, too.

20:36.777 --> 20:38.028
Ravi, this could be it!

20:38.820 --> 20:42.032
If we can find
enough evidence to back up my vision,

20:42.115 --> 20:43.867
we could finally put Blaine away.

20:44.368 --> 20:46.954
Put him in zombie jail! Freeze that clown!

20:47.454 --> 20:48.664
Dare to dream.

20:48.872 --> 20:50.832
Thank you. We'll be waiting. Goodbye.

20:52.125 --> 20:54.086
They're bringing Blaine in right now.

20:54.253 --> 20:55.671
We're on the same page, right?

20:56.380 --> 20:58.215
He did it. I saw him.

20:58.298 --> 20:59.716
All right, we still need to prove it.

20:59.800 --> 21:01.927
We don't know where it happened
and we don't know why.

21:02.010 --> 21:04.346
Blaine's not just gonna
give that information up.

21:04.429 --> 21:06.556
This interrogation is gonna be a slog.

21:08.892 --> 21:11.895
Hey. I need you in the game.

21:12.312 --> 21:15.816
Copy. Gloves stay on. Good talk, Babs.

21:16.900 --> 21:18.402
Go get 'em.

21:18.485 --> 21:19.486
Detective?

21:21.321 --> 21:23.865
Blaine DeBeers, table for three.

21:33.417 --> 21:36.044
So... What's new with you two?

21:36.420 --> 21:37.921
Oh, nothin' much.

21:38.588 --> 21:42.259
I guess the big news with me is, uh,
I saw you murder a couple guys.

21:43.343 --> 21:44.511
What? I did.

21:45.345 --> 21:48.265
Where were you Tuesday night
between 11:00 p.m. and 1:00 a.m.?

21:48.348 --> 21:51.101
I'm sorry, are we not gonna
address the missing tooth?

21:51.184 --> 21:52.185
It's none of your business.

21:52.269 --> 21:54.855
And my whereabouts
Tuesday night are none of yours.

21:55.147 --> 21:56.523
Unless you're charging me with something.

21:57.899 --> 21:59.276
Yeah. Didn't think so.

21:59.901 --> 22:01.987
Which means you didn't
really see me kill anyone.

22:02.070 --> 22:03.530
Oh, I saw you all right.

22:03.947 --> 22:06.533
I watched you put
a bullet in a zombie's head,

22:06.616 --> 22:07.617
right behind a building.

22:07.701 --> 22:10.037
Another man ran over to help.
And you shot him, too.

22:10.829 --> 22:13.123
That sounds an awful lot
like a vision to me.

22:13.206 --> 22:16.960
And last I checked, hearsay evidence
isn't admissible in a court of law, so...

22:17.711 --> 22:19.921
I swear, you guys used to
be better at this stuff.

22:20.339 --> 22:22.341
You wanna see what
I'm better at now, pigeon?

22:22.424 --> 22:24.259
Keep beakin' and I'll tune you right up.

22:27.345 --> 22:29.056
What happened to us?

22:29.973 --> 22:33.769
We used to be the OGZ's.
Now every time we get together it's all,

22:33.852 --> 22:36.229
"Where were you the night
so"

22:36.938 --> 22:37.773
Hmm.

22:38.857 --> 22:42.402
Tuesday between 11:00 and 1:00,
I was at my restaurant.

22:42.486 --> 22:44.613
A Mr. Donald Eberhard can verify.

22:46.782 --> 22:47.824
What else you got?

23:01.254 --> 23:02.547
-Wake up.

23:04.466 --> 23:05.592
What do you want?

23:05.675 --> 23:07.427
Your smugglers were supposed
to be here two hours ago.

23:07.511 --> 23:08.678
Where are they?

23:08.887 --> 23:10.555
Relax. They'll be here.

23:11.014 --> 23:12.724
Sloane! Where's Sloane?

23:16.728 --> 23:17.979
She was just here!

23:21.274 --> 23:23.068
Major!
Yeah?

23:23.902 --> 23:26.404
I've got some good news
and I've got some bad news.

23:29.032 --> 23:30.742
No, no, she's not breathing.

23:32.869 --> 23:34.121
Oh.

23:34.204 --> 23:36.456
Looks like she took
two rides on the U-Boat.

23:39.292 --> 23:40.293
Come on.

23:44.631 --> 23:46.925
She's dying, man! What are we gonna do?

23:51.721 --> 23:53.598
A dead girl is <i>no bueno.</i>

24:26.756 --> 24:32.429
How many times must I evade and deflect

24:32.512 --> 24:34.764
the same questions?

24:35.015 --> 24:36.474
I got a new one for you.

24:37.309 --> 24:38.810
Next time we scrap,

24:38.894 --> 24:41.062
which hand do you want me
to knock you out with?

24:41.730 --> 24:45.775
Walk me through everything
you did last Tuesday, one more time.

24:45.859 --> 24:47.736
Come on! You're better than this.

24:48.069 --> 24:51.448
You got no witnesses,
no murder weapon, no motive.

24:51.615 --> 24:53.491
You'll never put me at that laundromat.

24:56.286 --> 24:57.370
What?

24:58.163 --> 24:59.206
What laundromat?

24:59.289 --> 25:01.082
You said you had a vision
outside of a laundromat.

25:01.166 --> 25:02.584
No, she didn't.

25:02.667 --> 25:05.003
We had no idea
where she was in the vision.

25:05.670 --> 25:06.796
Until now.

25:07.547 --> 25:08.548
Clive...

25:21.269 --> 25:24.356
I met Seattle's number one
human importer/exporter

25:24.439 --> 25:25.857
at a laundromat. You know, the night--

25:25.941 --> 25:28.443
Na-na-na. I can't hear you.

25:28.526 --> 25:32.113
That can't be a coincidence.
She always had muscle around.

25:33.490 --> 25:34.741
So what are we thinking?

25:35.283 --> 25:38.495
Blaine kills Gordie and the
other zombies to get to this coyote?

25:38.578 --> 25:40.330
She goes by Mama Leone.

25:40.830 --> 25:42.082
And Renegade!

25:42.165 --> 25:46.920
What part of "Na-na-na, I can't hear you"
don't you understand?

25:47.629 --> 25:49.339
This is dangerous info, Liv.

25:49.422 --> 25:51.591
What does Blaine have against Mama Leone?

25:51.675 --> 25:54.427
Wasn't she just creating
more customers for him?

25:55.095 --> 25:56.221
I don't know.

25:57.681 --> 25:59.933
-Detergent Care.

26:01.059 --> 26:03.979
I'll send a CSI unit over there
to canvass.

26:04.312 --> 26:06.940
If we can establish
the laundromat as the scene of the crime

26:07.023 --> 26:09.985
and link Blaine to it, we'll have him.

26:10.902 --> 26:15.198
Case closed, <i>mes amis.</i>

26:15.282 --> 26:17.867
I have found our murderers
and secured their confessions.

26:20.620 --> 26:23.540
Whodunnit, you will ask?

26:24.874 --> 26:29.087
Two Dead Enders terrorists.
Just as I predicted.

26:31.423 --> 26:35.719
With all due respect, Inspector,
how did you come up with, uh--

26:35.802 --> 26:38.096
Investigative techniques.

26:38.722 --> 26:40.056
You've heard of these, yes?

26:46.313 --> 26:50.191
You don't have the killer,
because we have the killer here.

26:50.275 --> 26:51.985
Liv. Liv!

26:58.867 --> 27:00.618
You will pay for this.

27:05.248 --> 27:06.333
<i>Sauvages!</i>

27:11.546 --> 27:13.840
The lieutenant doesn't need
to know about this.

27:18.636 --> 27:19.679
Oh.

27:19.763 --> 27:21.431
Is she the one
that left a note on the door?

27:21.973 --> 27:24.434
She thought Anthony
should move out to the country?

27:27.187 --> 27:28.355
Uh-oh.

27:28.480 --> 27:30.440
I smell a lawsuit.

27:30.690 --> 27:33.526
Detective Babineaux,
make sure the camera's on.

27:33.610 --> 27:37.655
Liv, Liv. Calm down. Breathe...

27:37.739 --> 27:39.908
-Just breathe.

27:42.118 --> 27:44.788
Whoa, whoa, big fella.
Breathe. It's okay. All right?

27:44.871 --> 27:47.082
Mama Leone said it's okay.
I have permission.

27:50.585 --> 27:52.337
-I have to go.

27:52.921 --> 27:54.798
The pieces are falling into place.

27:56.383 --> 27:58.009
You really should get that tooth fixed.

28:08.186 --> 28:10.230
-I gotta go, too.
-No, you don't.

28:10.855 --> 28:13.566
Okay.  Worth a shot.

28:28.623 --> 28:30.500
Could've used you out there today.

28:31.960 --> 28:34.212
Covey was really laying down the lumber.

28:34.295 --> 28:36.005
I know who killed Gordie.

28:37.090 --> 28:38.967
It was Blaine DeBeers. You know him?

28:39.050 --> 28:41.678
The zombie who owns
The Scratching Post and Romeros, right?

28:43.096 --> 28:44.347
People say he's shady.

28:44.764 --> 28:47.142
You and Gordie both worked
for Mama Leone, didn't you?

28:47.809 --> 28:50.937
Why do you need to ask?
Didn't you already see it in a vision?

28:51.312 --> 28:53.356
Do you know if Mama Leone's still alive?

28:53.440 --> 28:54.441
I don't.

28:55.316 --> 28:56.359
Do you care?

28:56.443 --> 28:57.444
Very much.

29:01.656 --> 29:04.200
Blaine DeBeers killed Gordie
to get to Mama.

29:04.284 --> 29:07.954
Why does the owner of a couple zombie
hot spots go after Mama Leone?

29:08.037 --> 29:09.330
Think about it, Liv.

29:09.789 --> 29:12.500
Who most wants to put an end
to the creation of new zombies?

29:12.876 --> 29:14.586
And who does Blaine DeBeers
need to keep happy

29:14.669 --> 29:16.129
if he wants to stay in business?

29:17.505 --> 29:18.548
Got it.

29:20.633 --> 29:22.051
It is Chinatown.

29:26.139 --> 29:28.016
Peytsie

29:28.099 --> 29:29.893
Doesn't matter,
you'll want to hear this, too.

29:30.101 --> 29:33.605
I think I know why Blaine
took out Mama Leone's security detail.

29:33.688 --> 29:35.148
Wait. Who is Mama Leone?

29:35.231 --> 29:37.400
-This very sweet lady--
-A human smuggler.

29:37.484 --> 29:40.945
Blaine is doing Chase Graves' dirty work.
If forensics can find--

29:41.821 --> 29:43.948
Why is Blaine out of interrogation?

29:44.032 --> 29:46.367
-I did.

29:47.202 --> 29:51.873
Fillmore-Graves called the Mayor's office,
said their investigator solved the case.

29:52.123 --> 29:53.124
You've got to be--

29:53.208 --> 29:55.585
And in no uncertain terms,
to release Blaine immediately.

29:56.044 --> 29:58.546
Thanks for having me over, guys.
Let's do it again soon, huh?

29:58.630 --> 30:01.216
Yeah

30:02.050 --> 30:03.760
Easy, tough guy.

30:04.302 --> 30:06.095
There's never a dull moment with you two.

30:06.179 --> 30:08.723
-Harris. Get him out of here.
All right.

30:12.727 --> 30:15.522
Why didn't you let me
drop that bender like a bag of feed?

30:15.939 --> 30:17.899
Because I don't know what that means.

30:18.316 --> 30:20.735
And because you can't keep
beating people up in the precinct.

30:20.819 --> 30:21.986
You wanna get suspended?

30:22.070 --> 30:24.113
If you're gonna bench me anyway,
what's the difference?

30:24.364 --> 30:25.824
Either way, I'm not in the game.

30:25.907 --> 30:28.243
Game's over, Liv.

30:29.869 --> 30:30.954
We lost.

30:32.455 --> 30:33.498
Go home.

30:48.179 --> 30:49.264
Oh, thanks.

30:50.682 --> 30:52.600
If Fillmore-Graves
is going to let murderers go free,

30:52.684 --> 30:54.519
the least they can do
is handle the paperwork.

31:03.111 --> 31:05.697
Excuse me. What happened?

31:06.281 --> 31:07.574
-Harris.

31:08.908 --> 31:09.909
What's going on?

31:10.827 --> 31:12.412
There was a bus crash in Delridge.

31:12.495 --> 31:15.248
Plowed right into a telephone pole.
Lots of fatalities.

31:15.540 --> 31:17.375
I guess the bus driver was a zombie,

31:17.458 --> 31:20.545
because he started
chowing down on the available brains.

31:20.962 --> 31:25.216
This one had a gun in her purse,
shot back at him in self-defense.

31:25.300 --> 31:26.634
Where is he now?

31:27.760 --> 31:28.803
The driver?

31:29.470 --> 31:31.389
She got him. He's dead.

31:42.734 --> 31:44.402
They begged me to fire him.

31:44.485 --> 31:46.404
They warned me
something like this would happen.

31:46.487 --> 31:48.197
This wasn't your fault, Peyton.

31:50.491 --> 31:52.535
You. What's the assessment?

31:53.745 --> 31:56.831
Me? Dr. Chakrabarti.

31:56.915 --> 32:00.627
Excuse me, yes,
Dr. Chakrabarti, Ms. Charles.

32:01.544 --> 32:02.921
What can you tell us
about what happened here?

32:03.004 --> 32:05.506
Five dead, including the driver.

32:05.840 --> 32:09.385
A cursory examination suggests
he hadn't consumed brains in some time.

32:09.469 --> 32:12.472
Passenger say he passed out at the wheel,
which caused the crash.

32:12.764 --> 32:16.100
When he came to, the blood and
head wounds of the dead passengers

32:16.184 --> 32:17.977
evidently pushed him over the edge.

32:19.103 --> 32:23.107
He devoured one passenger's brain,
and then chased a young woman, a nurse,

32:23.191 --> 32:25.777
out the rear exit
and into a busy intersection.

32:26.027 --> 32:27.362
She had a gun on her,

32:27.445 --> 32:29.822
and was eventually able
to put the driver down with a headshot.

32:29.906 --> 32:32.659
That's great.
A mindless, bloodthirsty zombie

32:32.742 --> 32:35.244
attacks Florence Nightingale
in broad daylight.

32:35.328 --> 32:36.996
What's that gonna do for our optics?

32:38.206 --> 32:39.749
Check the distribution records.

32:39.832 --> 32:42.210
I want to know why this man
wasn't getting his brain tubes.

32:42.377 --> 32:44.128
-Otto Harrison.

32:44.212 --> 32:45.838
I met him a couple days ago. I...

32:46.381 --> 32:48.132
Promised I'd have
extra brain tubes sent to him.

32:48.216 --> 32:50.635
-Then hunger shouldn't have been--
-He wasn't eating them.

32:50.718 --> 32:53.471
His wife and kids are zombies too,
and the brains are so diluted now,

32:53.554 --> 32:54.597
they were still going hungry.

32:54.681 --> 32:56.933
Otto gave his tubes to his kids.

32:58.267 --> 33:00.478
I'll make sure the situation
is rectified asap,

33:01.187 --> 33:03.356
and that Mr. Harrison's family
is provided for.

33:04.524 --> 33:06.484
Sorry if I was rude. It's been a long day.

33:06.901 --> 33:08.987
I'm sure you can relate. Good evening.

33:10.905 --> 33:12.198
There's press outside.

33:12.740 --> 33:14.409
Why wouldn't there be?

33:15.076 --> 33:18.579
I told Enzo to find the people responsible
for cutting our brain tubes weeks ago.

33:18.663 --> 33:22.250
Yes, sir. Yes. That's supply.

33:22.542 --> 33:24.043
But what about demand?

33:24.127 --> 33:27.255
Every new zombie strains our resources.

33:27.922 --> 33:29.757
You need to make an example of Renegade

33:29.841 --> 33:33.302
before the decision-makers in
Washington decide General Mills is right,

33:34.012 --> 33:36.097
and nuke us out of existence.

33:37.765 --> 33:40.893
<i>We're living in a zombie city</i>
<i>now, all bets are off.</i>

33:41.394 --> 33:43.187
Up is down, black is white.

33:43.688 --> 33:46.441
Don't tell that to the Seattle PD.
No, it's...

33:46.566 --> 33:48.359
It's business as usual over there.

33:48.818 --> 33:52.155
Blaine DeBeers is evil,
so let's put the screws to him all night.

33:52.238 --> 33:54.490
Well, you did kinda kill all those guys.

33:58.202 --> 33:59.328
Where's Don E.?

34:02.415 --> 34:03.791
Ah, damn, that's cold.

34:03.875 --> 34:06.377
-Hey!
-Hey!

34:06.461 --> 34:08.337
There's Don E.

34:10.506 --> 34:11.799
G.I. Joe.

34:11.883 --> 34:13.259
Oh. Destro.

34:14.260 --> 34:15.595
Everything go according to plan?

34:15.928 --> 34:17.055
Not everything.

34:21.059 --> 34:22.226
I guess not.

34:22.310 --> 34:24.979
Hey! That's my brain, missy.

34:31.819 --> 34:34.363
I'm gonna let you handle this.

34:37.950 --> 34:39.619
These brain tubes
will cover your first week.

34:39.786 --> 34:42.830
After that, you pick up your rations
from one of our distribution centers.

34:44.290 --> 34:45.708
You can't do this to me.

34:46.084 --> 34:48.795
That pamphlet there tells you
where you can get your zombie ID card.

34:48.878 --> 34:49.879
You'll need that.

34:51.672 --> 34:53.007
Do you know who I am?

34:53.091 --> 34:54.675
We've provided you with a place to live,

34:55.134 --> 34:57.553
but your activities
and communications will be monitored.

34:58.471 --> 34:59.931
That's all. Dismissed.

35:00.139 --> 35:02.475
My father works for
the Defense Department! General Mills, maybe you've heard of him?

35:05.728 --> 35:08.523
He'll turn this city into a parking lot
when he finds out what you've done.

35:11.275 --> 35:12.485
He loves you, I assume.

35:13.319 --> 35:14.570
Yes. Of course he loves me.

35:14.654 --> 35:16.280
Then I think his long-standing desire

35:16.364 --> 35:18.783
to turn Seattle
into a parking lot will be mitigated.

35:41.639 --> 35:43.349
Thought I was the only one here this late.

35:44.267 --> 35:46.269
Ran out of booze in my office.

35:48.271 --> 35:49.730
Good work on your assignment.

35:51.399 --> 35:52.692
You may have saved us all.

35:52.775 --> 35:55.069
Yeah, well, it didn't go
exactly according to plan.

35:55.570 --> 35:56.946
Well, it so rarely does.

35:57.530 --> 36:00.992
We've all had to do things that we never
would've imagined ourselves doing.

36:04.287 --> 36:05.913
You gotta do what you gotta do.

36:36.819 --> 36:39.322
Zombie

36:41.866 --> 36:44.785
You've been found guilty
of the crimes of human smuggling

36:45.161 --> 36:47.538
and the unauthorized creation
of new zombies.

36:51.792 --> 36:53.753
The sentence for these crimes is death,

36:55.546 --> 36:58.883
to be carried out by public execution
at 12:00 this afternoon.

37:02.053 --> 37:04.722
I'm not ready to die.

37:10.937 --> 37:12.188
It'll be painless.

37:53.479 --> 37:56.565
What kind of justice can there be
if we're living in a dictatorship now?

37:56.732 --> 38:00.069
What we do, solve crimes, why bother?

38:01.279 --> 38:05.199
Blaine will answer for his crimes someday,
one way or another.

38:05.950 --> 38:06.951
I have to believe that.

38:07.285 --> 38:08.911
I wish I shared your optimism.

38:08.995 --> 38:09.996
Liv. What is it?

38:11.747 --> 38:13.708
Fillmore-Graves is gonna use
that stupid guillotine.

38:13.791 --> 38:15.626
They're gonna execute that human smuggler.

38:15.710 --> 38:16.877
They didn't even announce it.

38:17.044 --> 38:19.338
They're ashamed of it.
Which they should be.

38:19.922 --> 38:22.133
<i>Fillmore-Graves</i>
<i>takes no joy in this act.</i>

38:22.717 --> 38:24.302
-But this is a new world.

38:24.802 --> 38:28.431
The laws we've enacted are essential
to ensuring our place within it.

38:28.514 --> 38:31.017
Save here! Save her!

38:31.100 --> 38:32.768
Save her!

38:32.935 --> 38:35.688
You're a monster, Graves!
Let her go!

38:36.564 --> 38:38.941
Let her go!

38:39.483 --> 38:43.321
Penalties for breaking
these laws are necessarily severe.

38:43.487 --> 38:45.906
Crush her skull! Kill her.

38:46.282 --> 38:47.283
Kill her.

38:50.036 --> 38:52.288
You have no right to do this!  Kill her! Kill her!

38:54.707 --> 38:59.045
Any action that endangers
our survival cannot be tolerated.

38:59.128 --> 39:03.299
Fresh brain-bites,
get your fresh brain-bites here.

39:04.675 --> 39:07.970
There are those outside
our walls who want to destroy us.

39:10.222 --> 39:13.559
And there are those in our city
working toward that same end.

39:14.143 --> 39:18.105
We will show the world
that humans and zombies can co-exist.

39:18.189 --> 39:19.357
Let me through.

39:26.405 --> 39:28.240
Our survival depends on it.

39:32.244 --> 39:37.958
The smuggling of humans into Seattle,
and creation of new zombies, stops today.

39:46.008 --> 39:48.928
Major! Major!

39:54.725 --> 39:55.768
Kill her.

40:03.984 --> 40:05.152
Kill her.
-Stand down.

41:13.179 --> 41:16.432
I need you to gather whoever's left
in Mama Leone's organization.

41:17.183 --> 41:18.184
Why?

41:19.018 --> 41:21.145
We're gonna pick up where she left off.
