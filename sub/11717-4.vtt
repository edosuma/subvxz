Open it or he dies!

00:26.991 --> 00:27.532
Open it.

00:27.533 --> 00:28.408
Open it!

00:35.650 --> 00:36.426
Get out here.

00:37.512 --> 00:38.538
Get out here!

00:38.610 --> 00:39.687
Tell him to come out here.

00:39.688 --> 00:41.788
Tell him! Do what he says, Dennis.

00:44.917 --> 00:45.629
Thanks.

00:58.498 --> 00:59.841
Please don't do this.

00:59.842 --> 01:01.029
I got three kids.

01:01.030 --> 01:01.954
Shut up!

01:02.475 --> 01:04.349
I know he tripped
the silent alarm.

01:04.559 --> 01:07.234
I know there's a dozen cops out
there just waiting to kill me.

01:07.235 --> 01:09.496
Then how the hell do you think
you're gonna get out of here?

01:12.108 --> 01:13.346
Out the front door.

01:28.881 --> 01:30.593
Dawkins,
you are surrounded.

01:30.868 --> 01:33.219
Drop your weapon or we will fire.

01:33.976 --> 01:35.152
Drop your weapon!

01:35.261 --> 01:36.799
Drop your weapon now!

01:37.170 --> 01:37.994
Fire!

01:49.566 --> 01:51.105
What the hell is this?

01:52.327 --> 01:54.027
His mouth is glued shut!

01:54.811 --> 01:56.211
This isn't Dawkins!

03:17.258 --> 03:18.457
Commander McGarrett?

03:21.676 --> 03:23.334
This is about my sister, isn't it?

03:23.335 --> 03:26.008
She disabled a smoke detector
on board in the bathroom,

03:26.009 --> 03:27.394
which is a federal offense.

03:27.395 --> 03:29.159
So we arrested her as
soon as she landed.

03:29.160 --> 03:29.951
Great.

03:29.952 --> 03:31.739
Jail? Are you serious?

03:31.740 --> 03:32.951
It was just a cigarette!

03:32.952 --> 03:35.066
Okay, Officer,
I think we... we're good now.

03:35.153 --> 03:37.212
Steve McGarrett,
from the governor's task force.

03:37.213 --> 03:38.667
You can release her
into my custody.

03:39.066 --> 03:40.759
Let me check with my supervisor.

03:40.760 --> 03:41.559
Thank you.

03:47.893 --> 03:48.730
I'm sorry.

03:49.218 --> 03:50.093
I messed up.

03:55.978 --> 03:58.119
I missed you at
Dad's funeral, Mare.

04:01.345 --> 04:02.895
Yeah, well, something came up.

04:06.354 --> 04:10.229
You know the last time I saw
you was at Mom's funeral?

04:10.879 --> 04:13.603
I guess that's the way we
do our family reunions.

04:13.866 --> 04:15.441
'Cause I was thinking
it could've been cool

04:15.442 --> 04:17.742
to have a picnic in between,
or something, you know?

04:17.743 --> 04:18.899
A picnic? Yeah.

04:18.899 --> 04:19.712
A picnic.

04:20.057 --> 04:22.831
Something that, I don't know,
normal families do?

04:33.293 --> 04:34.991
How did you say you
were injured, again?

04:34.992 --> 04:36.438
Well, originally, uh...

04:36.439 --> 04:37.752
playing high school baseball,

04:37.753 --> 04:40.477
but, uh, it hasn't bothered
me in a really long time.

04:40.616 --> 04:43.727
Anything traumatic recently,
with the knee?

04:43.728 --> 04:45.728
Yeah, actually.
I got a new partner.

04:46.391 --> 04:48.427
I was thinking more
about a physical injury.

04:48.428 --> 04:51.501
No, no, this-this guy is
like a physical injury, Doc.

04:51.502 --> 04:53.026
Ten minutes after meeting him,

04:53.027 --> 04:55.665
I get shot and blasted backwards
through a window, okay?

04:55.666 --> 04:56.664
A few hours after that,

04:56.665 --> 04:58.916
he drives a car... not joking...

04:58.938 --> 05:01.593
onto the deck of a
Chinese freighter ship.

05:01.594 --> 05:03.061
And, yes, I was in it.

05:03.062 --> 05:04.950
The car, not the ship.

05:04.951 --> 05:07.436
He drove a car onto a boat?

05:07.437 --> 05:08.694
Yeah. He's an animal.

05:08.695 --> 05:11.615
And I sorta get the feeling that
he's just getting warmed up.

05:11.616 --> 05:12.249
Ouch.

05:12.250 --> 05:12.949
Yeah.

05:13.249 --> 05:14.982
So, how do I fix it?

05:14.983 --> 05:16.252
You get a new partner.

05:16.812 --> 05:19.282
Yeah, I'd like that, but I don't
think that's gonna happen.

05:19.283 --> 05:20.058
Well...

05:20.771 --> 05:23.780
I'm seeing a slight
tear on the ACL.

05:24.068 --> 05:26.156
So, you're going to have
to stay off that knee

05:26.157 --> 05:28.375
for a couple of weeks,
physical therapy,

05:28.376 --> 05:30.700
and I'll put you on some
anti-inflammatories.

05:30.701 --> 05:33.126
Can I get those, uh,
to go? Please?

05:43.484 --> 05:43.959
I'll be back.

05:43.960 --> 05:45.534
Hey, stay.

05:45.584 --> 05:46.559
I'm not a dog.

05:46.560 --> 05:47.434
Stay.

05:49.619 --> 05:50.141
What happened to you?

05:50.142 --> 05:51.490
Oh. Uh, I blame you.

05:51.491 --> 05:53.869
I tore my ACL somewhere
in the last few weeks,

05:53.870 --> 05:55.517
all the fun we've
been having together.

05:55.930 --> 05:57.788
All right. Well,
once you're done bitching about

05:57.789 --> 05:59.735
your boo-boo, I'd love to
know what's going on here.

05:59.912 --> 06:01.388
We got an escaped prisoner,

06:01.389 --> 06:02.425
three dead guards.

06:02.426 --> 06:04.048
Department of Public
Safety's trying to figure out

06:04.049 --> 06:05.161
what the hell happened,

06:05.162 --> 06:06.350
Where's Chin and Kono?

06:06.811 --> 06:08.098
Inside, getting background.

06:08.099 --> 06:09.000
Is that your sister in the car?

06:09.001 --> 06:10.627
Yeah, I just came
straight from the airport.

06:10.628 --> 06:13.037
You realize if she were a dog,
you could get a ticket

06:13.038 --> 06:13.977
for leaving her in
the car like that?

06:13.978 --> 06:14.970
Can we focus, please?

06:14.971 --> 06:15.746
Yeah.

06:16.121 --> 06:17.583
Why do you have aneurism-face?

06:18.147 --> 06:19.497
I don't have aneurism-face.

06:19.498 --> 06:20.545
She gave you aneurism-face?

06:20.546 --> 06:22.227
How many times in a row can
you ask me the same question?

06:22.228 --> 06:24.859
"You gotta seek first to understand,
then to be understood."

06:24.860 --> 06:27.150
It's one of seven principles
of all successful people.

06:27.151 --> 06:30.232
I will literally pay you
cash to stop talking, okay?

06:30.233 --> 06:31.619
Excuse me, Officer?

06:32.700 --> 06:34.553
My blue pickup is just
around the corner.

06:34.554 --> 06:35.517
There's a woman sitting it in.

06:35.518 --> 06:37.848
It's my sister; I'm putting
her in your custody, okay?

06:37.849 --> 06:38.720
Get her some food,

06:38.721 --> 06:40.032
take her back to my office,

06:40.033 --> 06:42.431
don't take your eyes off her
until I get there, you got it?

06:42.432 --> 06:43.880
Yes, sir. Thank you.

06:44.793 --> 06:45.543
You happy?

06:45.625 --> 06:48.087
Hey. Fugitive's name
is Walton Dawkins.

06:48.088 --> 06:49.263
He's originally from the mainland,

06:49.264 --> 06:51.449
but he did ten years at the
Allen Correctional Facility

06:51.450 --> 06:53.473
in Cleveland for
multiple home invasions.

06:53.474 --> 06:55.987
Apparently our guy likes hitting
families with big money.

06:56.349 --> 06:59.437
Then he violated his parole by
coming to Hawaii six years ago.

06:59.438 --> 07:00.843
My guess is it
wasn't for the surf.

07:00.844 --> 07:03.183
Dawkins killed a young couple
during one of his burglaries.

07:03.184 --> 07:05.119
But get this:
according to the warden,

07:05.120 --> 07:06.827
he's been a model
prisoner up until now.

07:07.026 --> 07:08.170
So what changed?

07:12.359 --> 07:13.422
Hey, guards!

07:14.021 --> 07:15.087
We need help in here!

07:15.088 --> 07:16.764
All right, so right before
the inmate collapsed,

07:16.765 --> 07:19.510
he was complaining of shortness
of breath, pain in his arm.

07:19.511 --> 07:21.307
Textbook signs of cardiac arrest.

07:21.308 --> 07:22.796
He's a little young
to be dropping dead

07:22.797 --> 07:23.862
of a heart attack,
don't you think?

07:23.863 --> 07:24.607
Yeah.

07:24.951 --> 07:26.326
Not if he was poisoned.

07:26.359 --> 07:28.296
We found this stuff
in Dawkins' cell.

07:29.189 --> 07:30.151
Nutmeg.

07:30.329 --> 07:32.441
Oh, yeah, they got the
prison bake sale coming up.

07:32.442 --> 07:33.497
Hang on a second.

07:33.498 --> 07:35.929
You can extract
myristicin from nutmeg.

07:35.930 --> 07:37.404
It's an organic compound,

07:37.405 --> 07:39.445
has psychoactive properties,
it works like a drug,

07:39.446 --> 07:41.912
and in large enough doses,
it's lethal and fast-acting.

07:41.913 --> 07:45.447
So Dawkins poisons an
inmate as a distraction,

07:45.448 --> 07:46.688
shoots a few guards,

07:46.689 --> 07:48.707
then walks out the door
wearing one of their uniforms.

07:48.708 --> 07:49.624
Yeah, in broad daylight?

07:49.625 --> 07:51.655
I mean, it feels like a lot
of unnecessary exposure

07:51.656 --> 07:52.925
for someone trying to
sneak out the door.

07:52.926 --> 07:53.782
Price of freedom?

07:53.783 --> 07:56.113
Or maybe he didn't think he
had time to dig a tunnel.

07:56.563 --> 07:57.587
What else we got?

07:57.588 --> 07:59.483
One of the maintenance guys
reported his car stolen

07:59.484 --> 08:01.374
from the parking lot.
We got HPD a description.

08:01.375 --> 08:03.336
Well, let's assume
Dawkins knows that, too,

08:03.337 --> 08:04.834
so he's going to abandon that car.

08:04.841 --> 08:07.028
We'll find it. Maybe it'll
tell us where he's going.

08:07.029 --> 08:07.864
Hey, watch this.

08:08.223 --> 08:09.480
Keep your eyes on the guard.

08:09.481 --> 08:10.781
Look at his holster.

08:12.144 --> 08:13.832
Safety strap's unfastened.

08:14.243 --> 08:14.955
Wait a minute.

08:14.956 --> 08:16.618
What the hell's he doing
with a gun, anyway?

08:16.619 --> 08:19.421
Weapons are for towers,
gates, and transports only.

08:19.422 --> 08:20.745
Maybe it was a rookie mistake.

08:20.746 --> 08:22.105
No, not a rookie mistake.

08:22.106 --> 08:24.332
He's in on it, he wanted
Dawkins to have that gun.

08:24.333 --> 08:25.666
So what's in it for the guard?

08:25.667 --> 08:27.965
Whatever it is,
it was worth putting an armed

08:27.966 --> 08:30.179
and dangerous fugitive
back on the streets.

08:40.061 --> 08:41.361
Billy Omana, right?

08:41.749 --> 08:42.163
Yeah.

08:42.164 --> 08:43.452
Yeah, put those on.

08:44.639 --> 08:45.201
Excuse me?

08:45.202 --> 08:46.359
Uh, he said put them on.

08:47.020 --> 08:48.471
Who the hell you
guys think you are?

08:48.472 --> 08:49.619
What did Dawkins offer you

08:49.620 --> 08:51.454
to help him escape
from prison today?

08:51.979 --> 08:53.616
I don't know what
you're talking about.

08:53.794 --> 08:54.862
Billy, so help me God,

08:54.863 --> 08:56.213
you answer incorrectly
one more time,

08:56.214 --> 08:57.658
I'm gonna put those
scrubs on you myself

08:57.659 --> 08:59.263
and then drop you in
general population.

08:59.264 --> 09:00.947
How long you think
you'll last there?

09:01.435 --> 09:02.497
You can't do that.

09:02.628 --> 09:04.541
This here says I can.

09:08.909 --> 09:11.331
Dawkins said that if I helped him,
he'd give me 50 grand.

09:11.332 --> 09:12.305
And you believed him?

09:12.306 --> 09:15.134
He arranged for $10,000 to
be wired into my account.

09:15.406 --> 09:17.179
He told me it was
everything he had.

09:17.180 --> 09:18.751
I'd get the rest as
soon as he got out.

09:18.752 --> 09:20.556
Where'd he say the rest of
the money was coming from?

09:20.557 --> 09:21.505
I don't know.

09:22.150 --> 09:23.901
All he told me was that
there was a lot of it

09:23.902 --> 09:26.373
waiting for him on the outside,
but in order to get it,

09:26.374 --> 09:27.992
he needed to get out today.

09:43.147 --> 09:45.563
I'm Detective Williams;
this is Commander McGarrett.

09:45.564 --> 09:48.021
We hear you and Walton
Dawkins were neighbors.

09:48.169 --> 09:49.188
Yeah, four and a half years.

09:49.189 --> 09:50.875
Warden says you guys
used to be pretty tight.

09:50.876 --> 09:53.995
Well, in the non-Biblical sense,
if you dig what I'm saying.

09:54.658 --> 09:55.482
So what happened?

09:55.483 --> 09:56.418
Why the beef?

09:56.419 --> 09:58.879
I didn't appreciate him trying
to gut me with a shiv last week.

09:58.880 --> 10:00.732
He said I was asking
too many questions.

10:01.157 --> 10:03.507
Questions have anything to
do with why he bounced today?

10:04.757 --> 10:07.982
You know, it's possible I may
have some pertinent information,

10:08.120 --> 10:10.342
but, uh, you gonna
have to play me for it.

10:10.343 --> 10:11.723
Play you? That's right.

10:11.724 --> 10:14.140
You win... I tell you
everything I know.

10:14.141 --> 10:15.672
What's to stop me
taking that basketball

10:15.673 --> 10:16.559
and beating it out of you?

10:16.560 --> 10:17.435
Bring it.

10:17.524 --> 10:19.213
They got better food
at the hospital anyway.

10:19.214 --> 10:20.931
What the hell you got to
threaten me with, man?

10:20.932 --> 10:22.706
More lockup time? Okay.

10:23.531 --> 10:24.581
We might be able to help you.

10:24.582 --> 10:26.294
Shave some time off your sentence?

10:26.945 --> 10:28.720
I'm doing double life, gimp.

10:28.722 --> 10:29.581
Excuse me?

10:29.582 --> 10:31.619
You got a busted ear, too, man?

10:31.881 --> 10:33.689
I'm on permanent vacation,
no parole.

10:33.690 --> 10:35.067
You could shave 10
years off my time,

10:35.068 --> 10:36.317
but I ain't never getting out.

10:36.755 --> 10:37.830
So it's either B-ball

10:37.831 --> 10:39.512
with tall, dark and uptight here,

10:39.513 --> 10:40.455
or nothing.

10:41.182 --> 10:42.519
I got all the time in the world.

10:42.520 --> 10:43.720
What do you get if we lose?

10:43.721 --> 10:45.268
I get the pleasure of
beating a cop's ass

10:45.269 --> 10:46.643
in front of the whole yard.

10:51.626 --> 10:52.866
Oh, yeah, play basketball.

10:52.867 --> 10:54.445
It's not like we have a
killer to catch, or anything.

10:54.446 --> 10:55.963
The clock's ticking.
He's our best lead.

10:56.137 --> 10:57.747
All right, game's to 21.

10:57.748 --> 10:59.569
Ten. Man's in a hurry.

10:59.570 --> 11:01.850
Okay, since you're a
guest in my house,

11:01.870 --> 11:02.871
you take it in.

11:08.017 --> 11:09.041
I got a tip.

11:09.091 --> 11:10.565
So you know, the other guy putting

11:10.566 --> 11:12.371
the ball in the hoop is-is bad.

11:12.372 --> 11:13.503
Danno, shut up, all right?

11:13.504 --> 11:15.418
Please, do me a favor and
don't call me Danno, huh?

11:15.419 --> 11:16.385
Yo, how long you two been married?

11:16.386 --> 11:17.488
Come on. Play ball.

11:22.955 --> 11:24.666
Okay, all right, time-out.

11:25.091 --> 11:27.316
Time-out. My time.

11:28.852 --> 11:32.122
You, uh, never played
basketball, have you?

11:32.123 --> 11:33.505
No, I've played once or twice.

11:33.506 --> 11:35.589
Yeah? Yeah, I mean,
I can see that.

11:35.590 --> 11:36.853
It looked like I was
watching Lebron,

11:36.854 --> 11:38.348
and maybe he's just
this much better.

11:38.349 --> 11:40.673
You know what? Football
was my sport, okay? Yeah?

11:41.223 --> 11:41.951
Now you tell me that?

11:41.952 --> 11:42.755
Hey, you ready to quit?

11:42.756 --> 11:44.582
No. Yes. Which one is it?

11:44.583 --> 11:46.717
Can you just give me a second,
please? Can I have some space?

11:47.049 --> 11:47.873
All right, listen to me.

11:48.310 --> 11:50.761
You're not gonna outshoot him,
so out-D him, all right?

11:50.762 --> 11:51.679
Play it like it's football.

11:51.680 --> 11:53.464
Put a body on him,
steal the ball away from him

11:53.465 --> 11:54.585
and put it in the hoop, huh?

11:54.586 --> 11:55.972
What's he gonna do, call a foul?

11:56.029 --> 11:56.941
We're in jail.

11:57.689 --> 11:59.610
All right, I can do that.

12:25.511 --> 12:26.398
That's game.

12:28.248 --> 12:29.361
Let's have it, man.

12:30.686 --> 12:32.648
All right, badge, here it is.

12:33.235 --> 12:34.568
A couple weeks ago

12:34.569 --> 12:36.383
we're in rec watching some tube.

12:36.384 --> 12:39.620
Samoan dude walks by,
he tries to change the channel.

12:39.621 --> 12:41.556
Dawkins almost throws
down right there.

12:41.557 --> 12:43.642
You should have seen him.
His eyes were-were crazy.

12:43.643 --> 12:44.951
Just 'cause he
changed the channel?

12:44.952 --> 12:46.345
No, no, bro, wasn't that.

12:46.346 --> 12:48.942
It was something on TV
that made him go crazy.

12:49.653 --> 12:50.704
What was he watching?

12:51.190 --> 12:54.772
Dana, your luxury vacation
includes first-class airfare,

12:54.773 --> 12:56.856
seven nights at the Kohiko Hotel

12:56.857 --> 12:58.919
all-access VIP passes

12:58.920 --> 13:01.275
to the annual Festival
of The Islands,

13:01.276 --> 13:03.074
which kicks off two
weeks from now.

13:03.075 --> 13:06.111
And since you'll need a
little spending money

13:06.112 --> 13:08.849
while shopping on
beautiful Kalakaua Avenue,

13:08.850 --> 13:12.362
we're throwing in $1 million!

13:18.067 --> 13:20.002
She's the reason that
Dawkins broke out of prison?

13:20.003 --> 13:22.031
She just won a million
dollars and a trip to Hawaii.

13:22.032 --> 13:23.651
Okay, but why her? Like,
there's not enough

13:23.652 --> 13:24.745
rich people on this island?

13:24.746 --> 13:26.911
She's away from home,
she's out of her element.

13:26.912 --> 13:28.750
Maybe Dawkins sees her
as an easy target.

13:28.751 --> 13:30.336
Whatever. I need
everything on Dana.

13:30.337 --> 13:32.891
Okay? Travel itineraries,
flights, car rental.

13:32.892 --> 13:33.605
Hey, guess what?

13:33.606 --> 13:35.448
I've done this before,
but thank you.

13:45.642 --> 13:46.841
***

13:46.842 --> 13:47.281
That's it.

13:47.579 --> 13:49.991
It matches the description
of the car Dawkins stole.

13:51.040 --> 13:52.866
Five-O. We'll take it from here.

13:57.283 --> 13:59.495
What are you doing?
Looking for cash.

13:59.685 --> 14:01.310
It's what Dawkins would have done.

14:03.311 --> 14:04.176
Empty.

14:04.177 --> 14:05.803
Says maybe he used
whatever he found

14:05.804 --> 14:07.862
to buy something. Food or water?

14:08.286 --> 14:11.018
No, Dawkins knows his face
is all over the news by now.

14:11.019 --> 14:12.230
If he wants to get off the island,

14:12.231 --> 14:14.561
the first thing he needs to
do is change his appearance.

14:20.297 --> 14:21.047
Coming in?

14:21.298 --> 14:22.636
It's the men's room.

14:23.060 --> 14:25.247
It's the luxury of
carrying a badge, kid...

14:25.462 --> 14:26.436
you can go anywhere.

14:35.913 --> 14:37.331
Lemonade mixed in mayo.

14:37.332 --> 14:39.067
It's an old prison
trick for dyeing hair.

14:39.068 --> 14:40.268
Seriously?

14:40.786 --> 14:42.686
Looks like our man's a blonde now.

14:44.434 --> 14:47.085
Purchases were made at an ABC
Store just up the street.

14:47.086 --> 14:48.261
15 minutes ago.

14:48.516 --> 14:50.133
Factor in the time for a dye job,

14:50.134 --> 14:51.323
he couldn't have made it very far.

14:51.324 --> 14:52.687
He could still be around here.

14:57.743 --> 14:58.692
You see that?

15:00.498 --> 15:01.571
Excuse me, sir.

15:01.572 --> 15:03.597
Every time I come across...

15:03.598 --> 15:04.690
Sir? I was...

15:06.652 --> 15:07.789
Gotta call you back.

15:09.563 --> 15:10.232
Hey, bro,

15:10.233 --> 15:12.106
where did you get the uniform?
Traded for it.

15:12.107 --> 15:13.693
Not really my style,

15:14.231 --> 15:15.968
but the guy threw in a phone, too.

15:16.666 --> 15:17.803
Pretty sweet deal, huh?

15:17.943 --> 15:19.218
We're gonna need that phone.

15:20.256 --> 15:22.043
What are you gonna trade for it?

15:22.179 --> 15:23.618
How about a pair of handcuffs?

15:23.949 --> 15:26.574
Yes, thank you very much. Okay.

15:26.636 --> 15:29.144
So Dana Thorpe and her fiancée,
Craig Ellers,

15:29.145 --> 15:31.772
landed at Honolulu International
earlier this morning.

15:31.773 --> 15:33.955
Just checked into a
hotel ten minutes ago.

15:33.956 --> 15:34.688
Chin.

15:34.689 --> 15:36.736
Hey, HPD found the car.

15:36.737 --> 15:38.924
Dawkins abandoned it
about 15 minutes ago,

15:38.925 --> 15:41.295
parking lot Kaako Beach Park.

15:41.296 --> 15:42.108
Got it.

15:42.596 --> 15:43.447
That's three blocks away

15:43.448 --> 15:45.129
from where Craig and
Dana are staying.

15:50.552 --> 15:51.414
Oh!

15:54.889 --> 15:56.082
Oh, my...

15:57.110 --> 15:59.147
I couldn't stand it.

16:00.602 --> 16:02.040
Oh, my God, me either.

16:02.041 --> 16:04.114
Never has there been a longer line

16:04.527 --> 16:06.267
in the history of check-in lines.

16:06.345 --> 16:07.294
Unzip me.

16:13.864 --> 16:15.252
Mmm! God, you are beautiful.

16:17.751 --> 16:19.663
What's it like being so beautiful?

16:37.482 --> 16:38.144
Clear!

16:38.205 --> 16:38.942
Clear!

16:41.477 --> 16:43.989
Oh, no! No, no, no!

16:45.240 --> 16:46.148
Dawkins is gone,

16:46.149 --> 16:47.037
so is Craig.

16:49.224 --> 16:51.315
You're gonna be okay. We're gonna
get you to a hospital, okay?

16:51.316 --> 16:53.655
Craig... We're gonna find Craig.

16:57.309 --> 16:59.058
This is Detective Kelly, Five-O.

16:59.059 --> 17:00.859
We need an ambulance,
Kohiko Hotel.

17:01.580 --> 17:02.480
Come on, come on, come on.

17:02.481 --> 17:03.279
On the way.

17:04.142 --> 17:05.130
She's not breathing.

17:06.185 --> 17:09.461
Come on! Come on! Come on!

17:19.845 --> 17:21.683
Hang in there, Dana, okay?

17:22.747 --> 17:23.671
Hang in there.

17:23.672 --> 17:24.720
It's all gonna be okay.

17:26.645 --> 17:28.242
We're gonna find Craig, okay?

17:28.883 --> 17:29.792
We'll find Craig.

17:39.106 --> 17:40.224
Hey, how is she?

17:40.418 --> 17:42.404
She's in surgery. Didn't
give me anything on the way.

17:42.405 --> 17:43.154
What do we got?

17:43.517 --> 17:46.517
Hotel surveillance camera picked
this up right after the attack.

17:46.818 --> 17:47.854
Doesn't add up.

17:47.855 --> 17:50.303
Why take Craig and leave Dana?
She won the money.

17:50.304 --> 17:52.318
But they're engaged, so maybe
they have joint bank accounts.

17:52.319 --> 17:54.118
Yeah, or maybe he wants
Craig for something else.

17:54.119 --> 17:55.935
You know what?
Freeze their accounts.

17:55.936 --> 17:58.586
I want thorough backgrounds
on Dawkins, Craig and Dana.

17:58.587 --> 18:00.130
Run their names through NCIC.

18:00.131 --> 18:02.282
Chin, what about the phone
you found? Dawkins got it

18:02.283 --> 18:03.580
from the car he
stole at the prison,

18:03.581 --> 18:04.888
but the call history was erased,

18:04.889 --> 18:06.676
so I figured he must have
made some phone calls.

18:06.677 --> 18:08.407
Reached out to the phone company,
and sure enough,

18:08.408 --> 18:10.447
two calls were made
right after the escape.

18:10.685 --> 18:14.028
First one went to a local
woman named Sofia Archuleta.

18:14.029 --> 18:16.294
Archuleta. That's
Dawkins' girlfriend.

18:16.295 --> 18:18.218
Warden said she's
a regular visitor.

18:18.219 --> 18:19.844
All right, so she's the
first one he's gonna hook up

18:19.845 --> 18:21.319
with for help.
What about the other call?

18:21.320 --> 18:23.043
That one was made to
a local lightweight

18:23.044 --> 18:25.267
ex-con by the name of Makani Huku.

18:25.268 --> 18:26.786
They spoke for three minutes.

18:26.787 --> 18:29.379
Kono, follow up on the
phone call with Makani.

18:29.380 --> 18:30.551
Find out what they
were talking about.

18:30.552 --> 18:32.908
Chin, pull Dawkins' jacket.

18:32.909 --> 18:34.755
See if we can find any
links on Dana and Craig.

18:34.756 --> 18:35.539
Easy.

18:37.427 --> 18:38.963
We need to get an
address for Sofia.

18:38.964 --> 18:39.698
I'll get it.

18:39.699 --> 18:41.895
You should change your shirt.
You look like an animal.

18:41.896 --> 18:43.318
You should go apologize
to your sister, too.

18:43.319 --> 18:45.049
She's been sitting
there for five hours.

18:47.304 --> 18:49.066
Thanks. I'll take it from here.

18:49.805 --> 18:50.918
Mary, I'm sorry.

18:51.968 --> 18:52.768
You okay?

18:53.359 --> 18:54.171
Yeah.

18:57.837 --> 19:01.176
So is this your big
"Welcome to Hawaii" Plan?

19:01.177 --> 19:03.252
Pin me to some guy with a badge?

19:03.253 --> 19:07.228
Mary, I'm trying to
keep you out of jail.

19:11.217 --> 19:12.042
Come here.

19:14.502 --> 19:16.057
What are you laughing at? Punk.

19:16.058 --> 19:18.320
Like seven years old.

19:25.409 --> 19:26.659
I don't get it, Mare.

19:28.159 --> 19:30.013
I mean, why come back here?

19:30.014 --> 19:31.396
You already missed the funeral.

19:31.984 --> 19:34.167
Do you think I feel good
about not being there?

19:34.168 --> 19:36.178
Truthfully? I don't know.

19:36.179 --> 19:37.321
I can't tell.

19:37.783 --> 19:42.081
I mean, we were
invisible to that man.

19:42.531 --> 19:45.733
I would have taken anything from him,
even disappointment,

19:45.734 --> 19:47.884
'cause at least it would
have been something.

19:50.784 --> 19:54.460
Listen, Mare, I know this is really
hard for you to accept, okay?

19:55.495 --> 19:57.156
But Dad loved us.

19:57.212 --> 20:00.250
He just didn't know how
to show it, i guess.

20:03.543 --> 20:04.193
Hey.

20:04.457 --> 20:06.872
I got that address
on Sofia Archuleta.

20:06.873 --> 20:07.819
Mary, right?

20:07.891 --> 20:10.328
Sis, meet Danno.

20:11.191 --> 20:12.165
Danny Williams.

20:12.793 --> 20:14.110
What's up? Not much.

20:14.111 --> 20:15.730
A tie? Seriously?

20:16.228 --> 20:17.867
Yeah, what is it with
you people and ties?

20:17.868 --> 20:19.379
We're in Hawaii.

20:19.380 --> 20:22.054
Wow. In stereo. It's great.
Thanks. You ready to go?

20:22.055 --> 20:23.765
Hey, perfect timing.

20:25.142 --> 20:26.266
How's it, haole?

20:26.427 --> 20:27.335
Shamu.

20:27.615 --> 20:28.999
What's with the stick?

20:29.147 --> 20:30.972
You got slammed in a cruncher?

20:31.144 --> 20:32.776
Um, I don't know what that means.

20:32.777 --> 20:35.656
Sand facial.
You ate a big one, huh?

20:36.281 --> 20:37.500
There was no surfing accident.

20:37.501 --> 20:40.051
He, uh, he busted his
knee getting out of bed.

20:42.068 --> 20:43.619
How white can you get?

20:43.793 --> 20:44.631
Pretty white.

20:44.899 --> 20:46.866
Who's this?
This is my sister, Mary.

20:46.867 --> 20:48.250
Mary, meet Kamekona.

20:48.750 --> 20:49.282
Hey.

20:49.283 --> 20:50.770
This is the reason I called you.

20:50.771 --> 20:53.056
I want a friendly face to
make sure she stays put.

20:53.057 --> 20:56.601
Oh, come on. You want me to
babysit your little sister?

20:56.602 --> 20:57.199
Correct.

20:57.200 --> 20:59.762
Shoots. Small kine.

21:00.636 --> 21:02.751
All right, she doesn't leave
this office, you understand?

21:02.752 --> 21:03.836
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on.

21:03.837 --> 21:06.452
Seriously? What if I
have to use a bathroom?

21:11.592 --> 21:12.679
Don't spill.

21:12.758 --> 21:13.658
Oh, my God.

21:14.606 --> 21:16.108
So inappropriate.

21:24.824 --> 21:28.050
Can you quit staring at me
like I'm a hot fudge sundae?

21:34.594 --> 21:36.285
Got a boyfriend, little sis?

21:36.286 --> 21:37.636
You got a girlfriend?

21:38.985 --> 21:39.773
I did,

21:39.870 --> 21:41.182
but we broke up.

21:42.396 --> 21:43.435
Tell me about it.

21:43.467 --> 21:45.692
Maybe I can help you
get back with her.

21:45.850 --> 21:48.200
Boss, I'm at Makani's address.

21:48.550 --> 21:50.676
When I badged him,
he tried to rabbit.

21:53.112 --> 21:54.361
Didn't get real far.

21:54.833 --> 21:56.429
What did he tell
you about Dawkins?

21:56.430 --> 21:59.066
Makani runs a fake I.D.
Mill out of the back of his shop.

21:59.067 --> 22:00.822
Dawkins was in here
about an hour ago.

22:00.823 --> 22:02.487
He picked up a driver's
license and a passport,

22:02.488 --> 22:04.171
under the name Carl Isner.

22:04.172 --> 22:05.495
Update HPD on the new alias,

22:05.496 --> 22:08.546
and make sure Homeland Security
adds it to the no-fly list.

22:09.556 --> 22:11.393
Do you always have
to walk so fast?

22:11.493 --> 22:13.193
That's Dawkins' girlfriend.

22:16.375 --> 22:20.648
Oh, you know, um, you sister-
she wasn't what I expected.

22:20.649 --> 22:24.263
I mean, aside from her
hereditary aversion to neckwear,

22:24.264 --> 22:25.120
she seemed pretty cool.

22:25.183 --> 22:26.592
What are you saying, I'm not cool?

22:27.117 --> 22:28.591
Well, in certain situations,

22:28.592 --> 22:30.418
like when you've got a
gun pointed in your face,

22:30.419 --> 22:32.864
or trying to decide to cut the
blue wire or the red wire,

22:32.865 --> 22:35.266
you're good but, you know,
human interaction...

22:35.267 --> 22:38.102
mammal-to-mammal-
room for improvement.

22:38.103 --> 22:39.877
That's all I'm saying.
Thank you, Dr. Phil.

22:39.878 --> 22:41.364
Can I get you guys something?

22:41.457 --> 22:43.119
Yeah. Walton Dawkins.

22:44.569 --> 22:45.432
Excuse me?

22:45.510 --> 22:47.645
Well, yeah, first, Walton Dawkins,

22:47.646 --> 22:49.220
but then I would love
some blueberry pancakes.

22:49.221 --> 22:51.037
I love pancakes in the afternoon.

22:51.038 --> 22:52.202
You like pancakes, Sofia?

22:52.203 --> 22:53.491
I like pancakes. You do?

22:53.492 --> 22:56.699
Yeah. You seem more like a
"Napalm in the morning" Kind of guy.

22:56.700 --> 22:57.902
That, too, but...

22:57.903 --> 22:59.886
Well, I wasn't talking to you,
I was talking to Sofia.

22:59.887 --> 23:01.050
I'm just saying,
it's a broad question.

23:01.051 --> 23:02.418
Okay, who the hell are you guys?

23:04.306 --> 23:06.765
Sofia, we know that you spoke
to Dawkins this morning,

23:06.766 --> 23:09.660
and you seem like a
reasonable, nice lady,

23:09.661 --> 23:11.583
who's just made some bad
relationship decisions...

23:11.584 --> 23:13.034
which I can totally relate to...

23:13.035 --> 23:14.858
so we're gonna give you a break.

23:14.859 --> 23:17.695
Yeah, I mean, this could
really only go two ways.

23:17.720 --> 23:19.138
The first is, you sit down

23:19.139 --> 23:20.357
and you tell us what
we want to know,

23:20.358 --> 23:22.195
then you finish your
shift and you go home.

23:22.557 --> 23:24.554
The second is that we arrest you

23:24.555 --> 23:27.394
in front of all your regular
customers and you lose your job.

23:27.395 --> 23:29.047
And I gotta get my pancakes to go.

23:29.048 --> 23:30.661
Right. And because
you've been uncooperative

23:30.662 --> 23:32.949
and helped a man who
killed three people today,

23:32.950 --> 23:35.400
you go to jail for aiding
and abetting a fugitive.

23:38.394 --> 23:39.544
Why don't you take a seat?

23:43.144 --> 23:44.269
You recognize this couple?

23:45.194 --> 23:46.780
No. Who are they?

23:46.781 --> 23:49.350
They're two tourists that your
boyfriend attacked today...

23:49.351 --> 23:50.756
Dana Thorpe and Craig Ellers.

23:50.757 --> 23:52.498
They're staying at the Kohiko.

23:52.922 --> 23:53.861
How do you know that?

23:53.862 --> 23:55.362
I have a friend who works there.

23:55.363 --> 23:56.977
Last time I went to see Walton,

23:56.978 --> 23:58.389
he asked me to call her,

23:58.676 --> 24:00.772
and find out when those two
were scheduled to check in.

24:00.773 --> 24:02.341
That information got Dana shot.

24:02.342 --> 24:04.604
Look, he didn't say anything
about hurting them, okay?

24:04.605 --> 24:07.175
He just wanted to know when
they were coming to Hawaii.

24:07.176 --> 24:07.876
Why?

24:10.152 --> 24:13.219
Okay, Sofia, Dawkins has
this guy Craig right now,

24:13.220 --> 24:14.808
and he's gonna kill him,
all right?

24:14.809 --> 24:16.690
And the only way we can
prevent that is if you tell us

24:16.691 --> 24:19.211
exactly what Dawkins said to
you on the phone this morning.

24:22.718 --> 24:25.070
He said something
about a big payday...

24:27.209 --> 24:29.130
then asked me for my car.

24:29.748 --> 24:33.611
Dawkins is driving a
2010 silver Chevy Malibu.

24:33.669 --> 24:35.753
Car's got a vehicle
recovery system.

24:35.754 --> 24:36.463
Can you track it?

24:36.464 --> 24:37.328
No problem.

24:46.772 --> 24:47.386
Ready!

24:47.387 --> 24:49.374
VIN number's two-niner-whisky

24:49.375 --> 24:51.374
niner-alpha-alpha-seven-niner

24:51.375 --> 24:52.989
two-eight-one.

24:53.502 --> 24:54.890
Give me ten minutes.

25:00.245 --> 25:02.057
Hey, I pulled Dawkins' jacket.

25:02.058 --> 25:03.362
You guys gotta see this.

25:03.925 --> 25:06.977
This guy's rap sheet reads like a
grocery list he's checking off.

25:07.377 --> 25:09.050
In Boston, he's jacking cars,

25:09.051 --> 25:11.397
in New York, he's robbing ATMs,
and then he graduates

25:11.398 --> 25:13.210
to full-on bank
robberies in Cleveland.

25:13.211 --> 25:15.269
Cops there suspect him of
murdering his stickup partner,

25:15.270 --> 25:16.758
a guy by the name of Paul Stark.

25:17.153 --> 25:19.991
The $5 million they stole together...
never found.

25:22.567 --> 25:23.503
Look familiar?

25:24.129 --> 25:26.633
- That's Craig.
- So no wonder he doesn't take Dana.

25:26.634 --> 25:28.106
He doesn't care about
her prize money,

25:28.107 --> 25:30.841
he wants the five million he
stole with Paul, or Craig.

25:32.028 --> 25:32.557
Kono.

25:32.558 --> 25:33.371
I got him.

25:33.416 --> 25:35.853
They just parked outside
Pacific Rim Bank.

25:41.453 --> 25:43.367
I watched you die.

25:44.903 --> 25:46.528
You watched me pass out.

25:47.173 --> 25:51.448
Doctors said the bullet you put in me...
missed my vital organs.

25:52.210 --> 25:56.020
Well, uh, lucky me, 'cause, uh,

25:56.733 --> 25:59.507
now I get to collect the money
that you hid from me, Paul.

25:59.508 --> 26:02.244
Or, sorry, what are you
calling yourself now... Craig?

26:02.994 --> 26:04.144
But you know...

26:04.657 --> 26:07.744
I couldn't believe when I
saw you on that game show.

26:07.983 --> 26:11.582
I thought I was losing my mind,
but there you were,

26:11.733 --> 26:12.844
in the flesh...

26:13.819 --> 26:17.128
a second chance at
getting what's mine.

26:17.478 --> 26:19.266
No, the money belonged to us.

26:19.853 --> 26:22.128
I figured you would double-cross me,
so I moved it.

26:22.129 --> 26:23.478
Smart boy.

26:24.253 --> 26:25.265
But, uh,

26:26.903 --> 26:28.803
you're not so smart right now.

26:30.745 --> 26:32.207
You listen to me.

26:32.218 --> 26:34.323
I know about that
Swiss bank account

26:34.324 --> 26:36.181
where you moved my money to.

26:36.182 --> 26:38.630
Now... here's what
you're gonna do.

26:38.740 --> 26:40.601
You're gonna go in that bank,

26:40.659 --> 26:43.553
and you're gonna wire
the money to yourself,

26:43.554 --> 26:45.417
and you're gonna
get it out in cash.

26:45.418 --> 26:46.854
You can't just walk into a bank

26:46.855 --> 26:48.594
and take out $4 million.

26:49.975 --> 26:51.099
You just go in there,

26:51.100 --> 26:52.492
and you get me

26:53.092 --> 26:53.905
what's mine.

26:56.837 --> 26:57.662
All right.

26:59.450 --> 27:00.187
Let's go.

27:27.860 --> 27:29.808
I said no cops.

27:29.809 --> 27:30.849
I didn't do anything.

27:35.310 --> 27:36.397
Go, go, go!

27:36.680 --> 27:39.047
Five-O requesting backup-
Pacific Rim Bank.

27:39.048 --> 27:39.980
Restaurant Row. Shots fired.

27:39.981 --> 27:41.947
Everybody out!

27:42.248 --> 27:45.006
You the manager?
Show me the back door.

27:45.007 --> 27:45.885
Let's go!

27:50.335 --> 27:50.740
Chin.

27:50.741 --> 27:51.578
I see him.

27:56.154 --> 27:56.791
Okay.

27:56.792 --> 27:58.058
Hey... where is he?

27:58.059 --> 27:59.429
He took my car!

28:00.199 --> 28:00.868
Kono!

28:00.869 --> 28:01.669
I'm on it.

28:05.763 --> 28:08.963
- Shoulder went through and through.
- Dana...

28:09.117 --> 28:11.769
The surgeons are working
on her now. Listen to me.

28:11.770 --> 28:14.229
Did Dawkins say where he
was going after the bank?

28:14.341 --> 28:16.753
I saw... I saw a passport.

28:17.501 --> 28:20.663
Now that he has his money,
he's gonna disappear.

28:35.641 --> 28:36.516
Damn it.

28:40.158 --> 28:42.631
Dawkins was on his way to the airport,
saw our checkpoint

28:42.632 --> 28:43.556
and made a U-turn.

28:43.557 --> 28:47.227
He's in the H3 tunnel,
headed into Halawa Valley. Uh-oh.

28:47.228 --> 28:48.202
Uh-oh, what?

28:48.415 --> 28:51.415
We're about to lose traffic cam
coverage in about two seconds.

28:53.327 --> 28:54.203
He's gone.

28:54.611 --> 28:57.947
I'm sorry, there's no other
cameras on that road. All right.

28:59.738 --> 29:00.600
One second.

29:02.293 --> 29:06.004
***

29:20.421 --> 29:22.241
Why, hello there, sailor.

29:22.242 --> 29:24.029
Cath, I need your help.

29:24.030 --> 29:26.420
I'm pursuing a suspect
in a black Mercedes.

29:26.421 --> 29:28.188
He's headed west into
the Halawa Valley.

29:28.189 --> 29:29.654
- Can you give me a visual?
- You want me

29:29.655 --> 29:31.848
to access an IKON
reconnaissance satellite

29:31.849 --> 29:32.800
for your car chase?

29:32.801 --> 29:35.176
This guy's killed three
people already today.

29:35.900 --> 29:38.366
Yeah, look, this could
raise some flags.

29:38.367 --> 29:41.230
Classify it as an NSA request
from a black ops drop box.

29:41.231 --> 29:42.732
Okay? Come on, Cath, I need this.

29:42.733 --> 29:44.227
You know, you're like
the good-looking guy

29:44.228 --> 29:46.210
from high school,
who knows how cute he is

29:46.211 --> 29:48.648
and just won't take
no for an answer.

29:49.494 --> 29:51.147
All right, i got
your black Mercedes.

29:51.148 --> 29:54.272
I'm sending you the grid
coordinates and imagery now.

29:54.909 --> 29:56.172
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

29:56.173 --> 29:57.955
Next leave, beers are on me. Okay?

29:58.018 --> 30:00.597
Oh, you are not
getting off that easy.

30:03.258 --> 30:05.502
You got her to use a
military recon satellite,

30:05.503 --> 30:06.408
and then you made a date?

30:06.409 --> 30:07.671
I'm a multitasker.

30:08.829 --> 30:09.767
Impressive.

30:11.232 --> 30:12.981
There... address that.

30:15.469 --> 30:17.492
He just pulled into
Makani Kai Aviation.

30:18.162 --> 30:20.012
It's a helicopter tour operator.

30:35.725 --> 30:37.274
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Fly!

30:50.685 --> 30:53.331
Please, I'm begging you.
We didn't do any...

30:53.332 --> 30:54.421
Will you shut up?!

30:54.422 --> 30:56.611
Hey, where do you want to go?

30:56.612 --> 30:59.375
There's an airport on the
north side of Molokai.

30:59.454 --> 31:02.298
Get me there...
and I'll let them go.

31:11.195 --> 31:11.585
Danny.

31:11.586 --> 31:13.108
Dawkins has hostages.

31:13.109 --> 31:13.910
No, no!

31:13.911 --> 31:16.467
According to Makani Kai Aviation,
their bird took off

31:16.468 --> 31:18.297
with a pilot and a family
of three coming back

31:18.298 --> 31:19.238
from a tour of the island.

31:19.239 --> 31:23.332
Chin, where's your friend?
On his way as we speak. Danny,

31:23.333 --> 31:25.416
contact Honolulu Approach.

31:25.417 --> 31:29.064
Give me the direction that
island bird is heading, okay?

31:29.065 --> 31:29.940
You got it.

31:30.727 --> 31:31.452
Good.

31:42.095 --> 31:42.445
Hey! Hey!

31:42.446 --> 31:43.809
It's all good, brah. Mahalo!

31:43.810 --> 31:45.195
You remember now.

31:45.196 --> 31:46.266
You bust 'em, you buy 'em!

31:46.267 --> 31:47.202
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

31:49.664 --> 31:51.264
Hey, you know what you're doing?

31:51.265 --> 31:52.152
Get in.

31:54.227 --> 31:55.356
Come on.

32:11.226 --> 32:12.651
We're running out of fuel.

32:12.652 --> 32:15.878
You're lying. This aircraft was
topped off to tour Honolulu,

32:15.879 --> 32:18.289
not island hop. Take a look.

32:18.290 --> 32:21.053
You see that?
That's ten minutes, max.

32:21.271 --> 32:24.161
It's 15 to Molokai.
Look, just find a way, all right?

32:25.455 --> 32:26.989
Spoke to Honolulu Approach.

32:26.990 --> 32:28.895
Your bird is six
miles east-southest,

32:28.896 --> 32:30.427
heading towards Molokai.

32:30.740 --> 32:32.140
Okay. Copy that.

32:37.880 --> 32:39.390
Chin, over there.

32:39.391 --> 32:40.902
They should be in that direction.

32:43.946 --> 32:45.714
Got 'em... about three miles east.

32:45.715 --> 32:47.710
Don't lose 'em. I'm coming around.

32:55.242 --> 32:56.060
What's going on?

32:56.061 --> 32:57.562
What do you think is going on?

32:57.973 --> 32:59.085
All right, here we go.

32:59.086 --> 33:00.461
Everyone hang on.

33:01.023 --> 33:02.511
This is going to get ugly.

33:07.068 --> 33:08.205
They just went down.

33:08.523 --> 33:09.273
Yeah.

34:03.627 --> 34:05.365
Got a single gunshot wound.

34:07.078 --> 34:07.978
He's dead.

34:08.266 --> 34:09.254
Family's gone.

34:09.666 --> 34:10.853
He took them hostage.

34:14.513 --> 34:15.603
***

34:15.603 --> 34:17.942
Look, please, just let
my wife and my son go.

34:17.943 --> 34:19.498
I'll do... None of you
are going anywhere

34:19.500 --> 34:21.393
until I get off of
this island, all right?

34:21.943 --> 34:22.594
Go!

34:22.594 --> 34:23.420
Move!

34:49.697 --> 34:50.635
They went this way.

34:52.097 --> 34:52.601
You sure?

34:52.603 --> 34:55.355
Birds fly away from danger,
away from predators.

34:55.356 --> 34:57.130
Dawkins is making a fast pace.

34:57.130 --> 34:59.165
He's snapping branches,
he's kicking rocks.

34:59.166 --> 35:02.098
The apapanes didn't like it;
one of them sounded the alarm call...

35:02.699 --> 35:03.649
off they went.

35:11.865 --> 35:12.965
Down here. Come on.

35:18.091 --> 35:19.329
Please, can we...

35:19.511 --> 35:21.762
can we stop an-and have
some water real quick?

35:21.763 --> 35:22.488
All right.

35:23.625 --> 35:24.874
One sip and then we go.

35:29.191 --> 35:29.940
Come on.

35:30.024 --> 35:31.324
Come on, come on, come on!

35:53.669 --> 35:54.856
They stopped here.

35:56.356 --> 35:57.431
No, don't do that!

35:57.918 --> 36:00.824
Molokai's rain forest's got
pathogenic microbes in the water

36:00.825 --> 36:02.517
that will put a man
down in an hour.

36:03.757 --> 36:05.362
Now, judging from those
tracks you found,

36:05.363 --> 36:06.720
looks like they drank from it.

36:07.003 --> 36:08.290
They won't get much further.

36:09.049 --> 36:10.047
Come on, Tarzan.

36:10.048 --> 36:11.447
Now we got an advantage.

36:26.303 --> 36:27.193
Who told you to stop?

36:27.194 --> 36:28.548
Please, something's wrong.

36:28.549 --> 36:29.259
We don't feel good. Come on, move!

36:29.260 --> 36:30.731
We don't feel... Move!

36:31.403 --> 36:32.290
Move!

36:32.339 --> 36:33.665
I can't get a clear shot.

36:34.134 --> 36:35.009
Dawkins!

36:37.084 --> 36:38.709
Come on! Come on!

36:40.434 --> 36:42.123
Move! Go! Move!

36:45.399 --> 36:46.772
Chin, go, go, go.

36:46.773 --> 36:47.799
I got you covered.

36:48.779 --> 36:49.615
Stay down!

36:49.731 --> 36:50.674
You're gonna be fine.

37:41.833 --> 37:42.620
Hey.

37:45.305 --> 37:46.168
Craig?

38:01.173 --> 38:02.511
I want to see him.

38:04.148 --> 38:04.924
Please.

38:17.511 --> 38:18.286
Dana.

38:21.921 --> 38:24.496
Why didn't you just
tell me the truth?

38:26.496 --> 38:28.421
I was afraid you'd
leave me if I did.

38:29.203 --> 38:30.402
You were wrong.

38:45.775 --> 38:47.149
I know what you're thinking.

38:48.362 --> 38:49.700
How could I not be angry?

38:52.004 --> 38:54.613
But the man I fell in love
with was Craig Ellers,

38:54.614 --> 38:55.951
not Paul Stark.

38:58.900 --> 39:02.412
Everybody deserves a
little forgiveness.

39:13.567 --> 39:14.935
Hey. Where's Mary?

39:16.085 --> 39:17.707
I got good news and bad news.

39:17.708 --> 39:18.420
No, no, no.

39:18.421 --> 39:21.083
I got back with my girlfriend.

39:21.508 --> 39:22.371
That's good.

39:22.425 --> 39:24.212
Bad news is, you lost Mary.

39:24.550 --> 39:27.887
Sorry. She confused me
with a Jedi mind trick.

39:28.937 --> 39:30.361
You want me to put out an APB?

39:30.362 --> 39:31.161
No.

39:31.536 --> 39:33.048
I think I know where she is.

40:18.896 --> 40:19.683
What's that?

40:22.801 --> 40:23.601
Lunch.

40:23.801 --> 40:34.001
