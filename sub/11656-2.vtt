AKU: Long ago in a distant land,

00:04.589 --> 00:09.302
I, Aku, the shape-shifting
master of darkness,

00:09.385 --> 00:12.972
unleashed an unspeakable evil.

00:13.056 --> 00:18.645
But a foolish Samurai warrior
wielding a magic sword,

00:18.728 --> 00:21.564
stepped forth to oppose me.

00:21.981 --> 00:23.775
(SWORDS CLANGING)

00:24.359 --> 00:26.569
Before the final blow was struck,

00:26.653 --> 00:29.197
I tore open a portal in time

00:29.280 --> 00:33.701
and flung him into the future,
where my evil is law.

00:34.327 --> 00:38.206
Now the fool seeks to return to the past

00:38.289 --> 00:43.169
and undo the future that is Aku.

07:01.797 --> 07:04.258
You are in the city of Andromeda.

07:04.800 --> 07:06.886
Well, the city is up there.

07:06.969 --> 07:09.680
You're down here
in the sewers of Andromeda,

07:10.097 --> 07:11.182
our home.

07:12.141 --> 07:14.310
How did I get here?

07:14.518 --> 07:17.855
(LAUGHING) Oh, oh, well,
you were in a battle--

07:17.939 --> 07:22.443
A battle with Mondo Bot,
and you were not doing so badly.

07:22.652 --> 07:25.404
Oh, but he is too powerful.

(MUTTERS)

07:26.572 --> 07:28.449
Who is this Mondo Bot?

07:28.658 --> 07:30.826
Come with me. I will explain.

07:30.910 --> 07:33.371
(WATER DRIPPING)

07:37.333 --> 07:41.253
Our city needed a protector,
so we built Mondo Bot--

07:41.420 --> 07:44.382
The most powerful
defense unit ever created,

07:44.840 --> 07:47.718
able to protect us against any oppressor.

07:48.177 --> 07:51.722
But something went wrong,
horribly wrong.

07:52.765 --> 07:54.517
The Mondo Bot turned on us.

07:54.976 --> 07:57.853
He began to attack
and destroy everything.

07:58.270 --> 08:00.523
We have lived here ever since.

08:00.815 --> 08:02.817
JACK: I am sorry.

08:03.234 --> 08:05.361
I wish there was something I could do.

08:06.612 --> 08:08.072
Well, there is.

08:08.197 --> 08:10.700
You see, you are the one.

08:11.117 --> 08:12.118
The one?

08:12.201 --> 08:13.202
Yes.

08:13.327 --> 08:17.957
We built Andromeda
on a magical ancient city of giants...

08:21.919 --> 08:25.756
Giants that are capable
of destroying the Mondo Bot.

08:27.633 --> 08:30.678
I still do not understand
how this involves me.

08:30.886 --> 08:34.598
Well, you wield
the same weapon as the giants.

08:34.682 --> 08:35.683
Show me!

08:35.891 --> 08:37.643
Swim into the city of giants.

08:37.893 --> 08:40.146
There. That will
make you breathe underwater.

08:40.312 --> 08:42.898
There, you will find the key.
