00:00.134 --> 00:02.835
♪♪

00:06.140 --> 00:07.923
-Wow!
-Mm-hmm.

00:07.924 --> 00:09.707
Okay, so this is where
we're gonna shoot our
season finale.

00:09.710 --> 00:13.679
Yes, SkyVolt and Zaydock
face-off in an epic battle here.

00:13.681 --> 00:15.180
Spoiler alert:
SkyVolt wins!

00:15.182 --> 00:16.648
Oh! What?

00:16.650 --> 00:19.151
And Garrison escapes
unharmed?

00:19.153 --> 00:21.453
Oh, sure. Yeah. Why not?

00:21.455 --> 00:22.621
(mouthing)

00:23.524 --> 00:25.791
Hello, set of<i> Voltage!</i>

00:25.793 --> 00:27.459
-(chuckles) Aw.
-Mm!

00:27.461 --> 00:31.830
Shnookums, what are you
doing here on my ice cavern set
looking so fine?

00:31.832 --> 00:34.066
Yeah, and in a tux, no less.

00:34.068 --> 00:35.367
Double-Oh-Nimbus.

00:37.471 --> 00:38.971
-Little lady.
-Hm?

00:38.973 --> 00:41.407
Old Johnny Nimbus
has weathered
a lot of stormy days

00:41.409 --> 00:43.142
on his road
to true love.

00:43.144 --> 00:46.512
But ever since you came
into my life, it's been nothing
but sunshine in my heart.

00:46.514 --> 00:49.815
-Aw.
-(gasps)

00:49.817 --> 00:52.251
Gemma, look at me.
Closer!

00:52.253 --> 00:53.318
Oh!

00:53.320 --> 00:54.987
Will you marry me?

00:54.989 --> 00:56.555
Oh, yes!

00:56.557 --> 01:00.259
I am gonna marry you
so hard, Johnny Nimbus.

01:00.261 --> 01:02.361
-Yes!
-(Liv panting)

01:02.363 --> 01:03.829
Oh, my God!

01:03.831 --> 01:07.199
Yay! Congratulations! Oh!

01:07.201 --> 01:09.568
If I could help with the wedding
at all, just let me know.

01:09.570 --> 01:12.204
I have fierce
party-planning skills.

01:12.206 --> 01:14.339
Liv, that would be great.

01:14.341 --> 01:16.608
Yeah! Okay, perfect.
When were you two
lovebirds thinking?

01:16.610 --> 01:20.446
Ooh, I wanna get this little
fireball off the market
A-S-A-Possible.

01:20.448 --> 01:22.448
(both chuckle)

01:22.450 --> 01:25.017
A quick wedding, okay, perfect.

01:25.019 --> 01:27.519
Uh, what were you thinking?
Maybe summer, fall?

01:27.521 --> 01:28.754
How about Sunday?

01:28.756 --> 01:30.022
This Sunday?

01:31.225 --> 01:33.559
How about
we get hitched right here

01:33.561 --> 01:35.861
in the ice cavern set?

01:35.863 --> 01:37.563
(awkward giggle)

01:37.565 --> 01:40.032
Um... okay.

01:40.034 --> 01:43.202
So you two wanna plan
a wedding in under a week?

01:43.204 --> 01:45.204
-Oh, no!
-Okay.

01:45.206 --> 01:46.572
We want you to plan it.

01:46.574 --> 01:47.639

Maddie, your boyfriend
has brought you

02:43.998 --> 02:45.931
the finest picnic
the Dairy Belt has ever seen.

02:45.933 --> 02:49.768
Chicken salad, tuna salad,
potato salad, fruit salad.

02:49.770 --> 02:51.937
If it's in salad, you will be
feasting upon it.

02:51.939 --> 02:54.540
Ooh! Can't wait!

02:54.542 --> 02:56.108
But, uh...

02:56.110 --> 02:58.944
didn't hear macaroni salad.

02:58.946 --> 03:01.513
-I'll raid the teacher's lounge.
-Ah! There you go.

03:05.619 --> 03:06.952
Hey, Mads.

03:06.954 --> 03:08.587
Hi.

03:09.990 --> 03:12.624
-I'm back.
-Yeah, wow, you're back.

03:14.628 --> 03:18.797
Diggie went to Australia,
and then, like a boomerang,

03:18.799 --> 03:20.065
he came back.

03:20.067 --> 03:22.234
Ha! For me.

03:22.236 --> 03:25.904
I told him that I
needed some time before
I was ready to talk,

03:25.906 --> 03:27.639
and I guess my time's up.

03:27.641 --> 03:30.108
So, thanks a lot, time.

03:31.178 --> 03:32.844
-Diggie, I--
-Look, I'm sorry, Maddie.

03:32.846 --> 03:35.581
Before you say anything.

03:35.583 --> 03:39.751
I spent every day in Australia
kicking myself for leaving you.

03:41.222 --> 03:43.055
I want to get back together.

03:43.057 --> 03:45.824
I'm not going anywhere
this time.

03:45.826 --> 03:47.659
I promise.

03:52.666 --> 03:54.466
Diggie, I'm seeing
somebody else.

03:56.337 --> 03:58.604
And I really like him a lot.

04:02.176 --> 04:05.711
And you and I both agreed

04:05.713 --> 04:09.915
that if the universe wanted us
to get back together,

04:09.917 --> 04:12.017
it would let us know.

04:14.021 --> 04:15.320
I'm sorry.

04:16.757 --> 04:18.957
All right, let's do this.
Whoo!

04:21.528 --> 04:22.694
Hey, I'm Josh.

04:22.696 --> 04:23.895
Diggie.

04:23.897 --> 04:25.163
Yeah, I know.

04:26.600 --> 04:29.034
I don't love that Maddie's
old boyfriend is back in town,

04:29.036 --> 04:31.270
but "Mosh" is rock solid.

04:31.272 --> 04:33.538
We've had two
great months together,

04:33.540 --> 04:36.074
and I've got a basket
of mayonnaise-based salads.

04:36.076 --> 04:37.976
That says commitment.

04:39.880 --> 04:41.146
Bye, Diggie.

04:43.484 --> 04:44.850
Bye.

04:47.721 --> 04:49.388
Diggie!

04:50.324 --> 04:51.823
What is up, buddy?

04:51.825 --> 04:53.659
You know I got a new locker
since you left?

04:53.661 --> 04:55.227
You wanna check it out?
Of course you do.

04:55.229 --> 04:57.462
-Link up, come on.
-Okay.

04:59.800 --> 05:01.566
So let's talk wedding.

05:01.568 --> 05:04.803
Johnny and I have put together
the "Gembus" wedding wish list.

05:04.805 --> 05:06.972
Okay. Ooh! Oh.

05:08.175 --> 05:11.510
Number one on that list:
Liv Rooney, serenading us.

05:12.613 --> 05:14.413
Aw, you guys!

05:14.415 --> 05:17.015
I would be honored
to sing for you.

05:17.017 --> 05:19.151
And number two: fireworks.

05:19.153 --> 05:20.752
Lots of pyro.

05:20.754 --> 05:25.223
I want our first kiss
as husband and wife to be
an explosion of love!

05:26.527 --> 05:29.194
It is like the words form
in my brain

05:29.196 --> 05:30.962
and then come out
of his mouth.

05:30.964 --> 05:32.864
Amazing.

05:32.866 --> 05:34.533
You're not gonna believe this.

05:34.535 --> 05:38.437
I've got fireworks from
last year's Fourth of July
block party in the garage.

05:38.439 --> 05:40.005
-Yes!
-Oh, Pete.

05:40.007 --> 05:42.374
You burned down
the Poundstones' gazebo.

05:44.445 --> 05:48.013
And I learned a lot
from that experience.

05:51.518 --> 05:53.952
All right, um,
have you guys thought about

05:53.954 --> 05:55.554
who is going
to perform the ceremony?

05:55.556 --> 05:57.489
-I was actually thinking--
-(clears throat loudly)

05:57.491 --> 05:59.157
(coughs) Ahem.

05:59.159 --> 06:01.793
Apparently, my mother
has something to say.

06:01.795 --> 06:05.464
Oh. Oh, yeah. No. I'm actually
an ordained minister and I would
love to do it.

06:05.466 --> 06:07.799
So thank you for asking.

06:07.801 --> 06:10.068
Uh, well, Johnny and I
did meet at your house,

06:10.070 --> 06:11.636
so that would be perfect.

06:11.638 --> 06:13.472
Oh, well, if you insist. Okay.

06:13.474 --> 06:15.907
All right, so now that
that is settled.

06:15.909 --> 06:18.643
Um, have you thought
about... a caterer?

06:18.645 --> 06:20.746
-Oh, yep.
-Mm-hmm.

06:20.747 --> 06:22.848
We've already hired
the best caterer in
all of Stevens Point.

06:22.850 --> 06:24.015
Oh!

06:24.017 --> 06:25.917
(gasps) Oh, no.

06:28.021 --> 06:29.888
Oh, yeah!

06:36.063 --> 06:38.830
A little formal for breakfast,
don't ya think?

06:38.832 --> 06:43.402
All right. You know
how we're always excited
for wedding food,

06:43.404 --> 06:45.737
but bummed that it only
lasts one day?

06:45.739 --> 06:49.408
I have a feeling
I'm gonna like the rest
of this conversation!

06:50.344 --> 06:53.879
Behold, my patent-pending
Parker Pockets!

06:53.881 --> 06:55.080
(Joey gasps)

06:56.116 --> 06:59.718
I have insulated pockets
to keep the cold food cold,

06:59.720 --> 07:02.554
thermal pockets to keep
the warm food warm,

07:02.556 --> 07:04.856
and leakproof
pockets for leaky liquids.

07:04.858 --> 07:07.793
Oh, I even have
the pants lined.

07:07.795 --> 07:10.362
Each leg has
a ten-gallon capacity.

07:12.199 --> 07:13.532
May I demonstrate?

07:13.534 --> 07:16.768
Oh, I will never forgive you
if you don't.

07:16.770 --> 07:21.106
The thermal pocket keeps
the pancakes toasty warm.

07:22.042 --> 07:24.009
A touch of syrup because...

07:25.245 --> 07:26.445
Well, it-- it's syrup.

07:26.447 --> 07:28.713
Yeah.

07:28.715 --> 07:33.452
And some ice-cold milk
to wash it all down.

07:36.390 --> 07:37.756
Voilà!

07:37.758 --> 07:40.325
We are going to smuggle
so much food from this wedding

07:40.327 --> 07:42.461
that we'll eat like kings
for a month!

07:42.463 --> 07:45.297
I have never been prouder
to call you my brother.

07:46.900 --> 07:49.334
(processional music playing)

07:49.336 --> 07:50.602
Wow.

07:50.604 --> 07:52.003
(giggles)

07:52.005 --> 07:54.573
You look beautiful, Maddie.

07:54.575 --> 07:56.074
Thanks. (giggles)

07:57.678 --> 08:01.413
You, mister, do make
a very handsome usher.

08:01.415 --> 08:02.581
-Oh.
-(gasps)

08:02.583 --> 08:03.915
Look at that.

08:03.917 --> 08:06.818
My hand fits perfectly
in the crook of your arm.

08:08.121 --> 08:09.688
May I show you
to your seat?

08:09.690 --> 08:11.590
Only if it's next to yours.

08:13.760 --> 08:16.161
Whew! Josh and I
really need a day
like today.

08:16.163 --> 08:17.929
No Diggie.

08:17.931 --> 08:19.231
No drama.

08:20.534 --> 08:21.867
-Yo!
-Yeah?

08:21.869 --> 08:23.001
Maddie, are
these seats taken?

08:23.003 --> 08:24.202
No, all yours.

08:24.204 --> 08:27.839
Awesome. Cool. Dude!
I found us seats
up front.

08:29.943 --> 08:31.610
Diggie, you remember Maddie?

08:33.947 --> 08:35.046
Hey.

08:35.048 --> 08:36.448
Diggie?

08:36.450 --> 08:38.116
Wh-- Huh?

08:38.118 --> 08:39.851
Why are you here?

08:39.853 --> 08:41.620
Diggie's my plus one.

08:43.190 --> 08:46.057
I had to give "Miggie"
one last shot.

08:46.059 --> 08:48.360
If that meant being
Joey's wedding bro,

08:48.362 --> 08:49.528
then so be it.

08:50.464 --> 08:51.863
-Hey, Maddie.
-Hey.

08:51.865 --> 08:53.498
Josh, have you
met Diggie?

08:53.500 --> 08:55.200
Everybody's met Diggie, Joey.

08:56.203 --> 08:57.969
I was just trying
to be polite, Mads.

08:57.971 --> 09:01.039
Way to make it...
(sing-songy) awkward!

09:06.647 --> 09:08.280
(sighs)

09:12.986 --> 09:15.220
Johnny and Gemma,

09:15.222 --> 09:17.322
are embracing a new life.

09:18.225 --> 09:19.824
Let's embrace them

09:19.826 --> 09:23.128
as we pass around The Love Hug.

09:25.198 --> 09:27.165
Hug the person next to you.

09:29.102 --> 09:32.871
The Love Hug
will build in strength

09:32.873 --> 09:35.373
as it travels around the room

09:35.375 --> 09:39.311
and comes back
to Johnny and Gemma.

09:41.248 --> 09:44.282
Pass all your love
in that hug.

09:50.891 --> 09:53.091
This is nice, but can we skip
to the kissing part?

09:53.093 --> 09:54.159
Okay.

09:56.063 --> 10:00.098
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

10:01.134 --> 10:02.834
You may kiss the bride.

10:04.404 --> 10:05.704
Cut!

10:08.141 --> 10:09.874
Where is my pyro?

10:09.876 --> 10:11.876
Oh, Dad, the fireworks!

10:11.878 --> 10:13.378
(explosion)

10:20.487 --> 10:24.456
I lit all the fuses,
but only one went off.

10:25.826 --> 10:26.925
Well,

10:26.927 --> 10:29.628
there may not be
any pyro here at the alter,

10:29.630 --> 10:33.231
but there's plenty of pyro
right here in Johnny's heart.

10:33.233 --> 10:35.433
Hey, Weatherman,

10:35.435 --> 10:37.802
there's a smooch-front
moving your way.

10:46.480 --> 10:49.180
All right, let's get
this party started!

10:49.182 --> 10:51.683
Terry the Clown,
fire up that Turkey Dance!

10:53.353 --> 10:54.719
("Turkey Dance" playing)

11:02.963 --> 11:04.295
Hey.

11:04.297 --> 11:05.864
Hey.

11:05.866 --> 11:07.799
So I saw that Joey
brought Diggie.

11:07.801 --> 11:09.100
(scoffs)

11:09.102 --> 11:10.702
How are you
holding up with that?

11:11.638 --> 11:13.938
Um... this is torture.

11:15.642 --> 11:17.575
I can't even make myself
do the Turkey Dance.

11:18.512 --> 11:20.345
And you know
I bring the gravy.

11:21.615 --> 11:23.348
That's actually why
I came over here.

11:23.350 --> 11:25.150
I figured you might
need to talk.

11:25.152 --> 11:26.685
Yeah, I just...

11:27.621 --> 11:32.323
Josh and I are in this
really great place.

11:32.325 --> 11:36.194
And Diggie just keeps
showing up and making
everything super weird.

11:36.196 --> 11:39.030
Well, did you ever think that
it might be becoming weird

11:39.032 --> 11:40.632
because you still
have feelings for Diggie?

11:40.634 --> 11:42.133
No.

11:45.472 --> 11:47.706
I mean, a little bit.
(sighs)

11:47.708 --> 11:52.210
I guess that we still have
a... sort of a connection.

11:52.212 --> 11:54.579
Yeah, you two
have a lot of history.

11:54.581 --> 11:57.482
But I'm with Josh now,

11:57.484 --> 11:59.551
and Josh makes me so happy.

11:59.553 --> 12:02.654
And isn't that the universe
telling me that I should just...

12:02.656 --> 12:04.689
be with Josh?

12:04.691 --> 12:06.991
Maddie, who cares
what the universe wants.

12:06.993 --> 12:08.326
What does your heart want?

12:10.764 --> 12:11.996
Maddie, we've got a problem.

12:11.998 --> 12:13.998
What? No, everything's fine.

12:14.000 --> 12:16.234
Everything is not fine.

12:16.236 --> 12:18.903
This Turkey Dance
doesn't have enough gravy.

12:21.842 --> 12:23.942
Let's go shake
our tail feathers.

12:23.944 --> 12:25.076
Ha!

12:27.280 --> 12:30.515
And now for the truest union,

12:30.517 --> 12:34.252
the marriage between
my yummy and your tummy.

12:35.455 --> 12:37.756
Let the buffet begin!

12:40.594 --> 12:42.727
Welcome to paradise, Munch.

12:42.729 --> 12:45.029
Stay focused.
We start at the appetizers

12:45.031 --> 12:47.298
and move
to the carving station.

12:47.300 --> 12:48.366
Got it.

12:48.368 --> 12:50.201
One for my plate,

12:50.203 --> 12:53.972
and ten for your suit.

12:56.543 --> 12:57.942
And...

12:57.944 --> 12:59.711
one for my plate...

13:01.381 --> 13:03.715
and ten for your suit.

13:08.722 --> 13:10.088
Whoa!

13:10.090 --> 13:12.757
Artie's famous lobster bisque.

13:12.759 --> 13:14.492
Ladle me up a pocketful!

13:14.494 --> 13:16.895
The most beautiful words
I shall ever hear.

13:20.400 --> 13:23.434
Ah, our bride and groom.

13:23.436 --> 13:24.736
(laughs heartily)

13:24.738 --> 13:27.472
Welcome to your glorious
wedding buffet.

13:27.474 --> 13:31.476
Prepare your taste buds
for a cornucopia of flavor,

13:31.478 --> 13:34.879
unrivaled by anything outside
the bright lights of Milwaukee.

13:38.351 --> 13:39.884
What do you mean
we're out of food?

13:47.794 --> 13:50.028
This will not stand.

13:52.599 --> 13:53.832
(upbeat music playing)

13:53.834 --> 13:55.200
(groans)

13:55.202 --> 13:58.436
That makes tonight
a whole lot less uncomfortable.

14:02.209 --> 14:03.608
Hey.

14:10.951 --> 14:12.851
I have no idea
what to say to him.

14:14.287 --> 14:16.955
I've been thinking about
what to say to her
for the past two hours

14:16.957 --> 14:18.556
and all I came up with
was, "Hey"?

14:25.632 --> 14:27.065
(sighs)

14:34.641 --> 14:36.140
Nice shot.

14:36.142 --> 14:37.375
Pfft.

14:40.046 --> 14:41.279
Check this out.

14:42.482 --> 14:43.815
Far table.

14:43.817 --> 14:45.383
No, what?

14:48.154 --> 14:49.621
Nothing but napkin.

14:53.326 --> 14:54.726
All right.

14:54.728 --> 14:56.060
Okay.

14:56.062 --> 14:57.729
Lucky shot.

14:57.731 --> 15:00.164
-No, that was amazing.
That was amazing.
-That was a lucky shot.

15:00.166 --> 15:01.566
Check this out.

15:03.236 --> 15:05.069
centerpiece, table six.

15:06.706 --> 15:08.172
I'm so sorry.

15:09.209 --> 15:11.743
-Oh!
-Oh!

15:12.712 --> 15:14.078
Unh!

15:14.080 --> 15:16.447
Okay, all right.
I'm gonna up the game.

15:18.585 --> 15:20.018
Table four.

15:20.954 --> 15:22.020
Fancy hat.

15:22.022 --> 15:23.588
Dig, you're gonna
hurt her.

15:23.590 --> 15:24.689
It's a roll.

15:27.027 --> 15:28.426
(gasps)

15:29.763 --> 15:31.262
(both laughing)

15:36.636 --> 15:39.203
It's nice to hear
you laugh again.

15:40.373 --> 15:41.839
Yeah, you too.

15:45.545 --> 15:47.145
Um...

15:47.147 --> 15:49.380
You know what,

15:49.382 --> 15:52.817
I should really go
find Josh.

15:59.392 --> 16:00.892
I know my sister,

16:00.894 --> 16:03.895
and I can see it in her eyes

16:03.897 --> 16:06.130
that she still wants
to be with Diggie.

16:07.801 --> 16:10.068
And Josh is
a really great guy...

16:11.071 --> 16:13.972
but the heart wants
what the heart wants.

16:14.908 --> 16:17.408
Okay. Liv, honey,
we have a situation.

16:17.410 --> 16:20.678
Grandma Nimbus lost
her teeth at the buffet.

16:20.680 --> 16:22.914
So grab some tongs
and come quick.

16:27.687 --> 16:30.888
Keep your eyes peeled
for the buffet thief.

16:32.926 --> 16:34.092
Hey, Artie.

16:34.094 --> 16:37.895
Hm. Clearly, you're troubled,
<i>ma petite amour.</i>

16:39.933 --> 16:42.300
I know what you're thinking
before you even think it.

16:42.302 --> 16:44.302
Ew, that is so not true.

16:44.304 --> 16:45.636
Isn't it?

16:45.638 --> 16:46.938
Cheesy crab popper?

16:46.940 --> 16:48.373
(sniffs)

16:48.375 --> 16:50.842
Dang it! That is what I wanted.

16:52.379 --> 16:54.112
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah!

16:54.114 --> 16:55.613
What's goin' on? Hm?

16:55.615 --> 16:58.983
Ugh.

16:58.984 --> 17:02.352
Maddie is pushing Diggie away
because she thinks it's what
the universe wants,

17:02.355 --> 17:04.856
but it's not what she wants.

17:04.858 --> 17:06.791
I'm glad somebody else sees it.

17:06.793 --> 17:09.293
I'm on Team Miggie.
The world doesn't get a vote.

17:11.631 --> 17:12.864
Universe.

17:12.866 --> 17:14.932
Whatever,
clearly they're idiots.

17:16.536 --> 17:19.037
Hey, uh, Artie,
I'm leaving, okay?

17:19.039 --> 17:21.239
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
Diggie, you can't leave.

17:21.241 --> 17:22.807
Why? Why?

17:22.809 --> 17:24.976
Maddie has clearly moved on,
so I have to too.

17:24.978 --> 17:27.578
-It's--
-(sighs) Don't go, dear brother.

17:29.315 --> 17:32.350
The Smalls men
and the Rooney women
are meant to be.

17:32.352 --> 17:34.385
Together, we're the Smooneys.

17:35.655 --> 17:37.555
You can't fight the Smooneys.

17:39.659 --> 17:41.159
Plus, you're my ride home.

17:42.562 --> 17:45.430
Yeah, Diggie, I saw you
and Maddie together

17:45.432 --> 17:47.765
and clearly, there is
still a spark there.

17:47.767 --> 17:48.900
I know!

17:48.902 --> 17:51.402
But, Liv, I've tried everything.

17:52.338 --> 17:54.372
There is still one thing
that you could try.

17:54.374 --> 17:55.673
Abduction.

17:55.675 --> 17:57.008
Grand gesture.

17:59.345 --> 18:01.612
Fine. Go with "grand gesture."

18:01.614 --> 18:03.247
But know we have a plan "B."

18:07.187 --> 18:10.788
Artie, we're tired
of dancing and need
to tickle our taste buds.

18:10.790 --> 18:13.591
Then you've come
to the right place.

18:13.593 --> 18:16.594
Say hello to your
cavalcade of cake.

18:16.596 --> 18:17.862
(guests gasping)

18:17.864 --> 18:19.630
-Ho-ho, look at that!
-Wow!

18:23.403 --> 18:25.703
I designed it for you, Johnny.

18:25.705 --> 18:29.507
You'll have to let me know
"weather" you like it.

18:32.745 --> 18:35.179
Dang it, Parker,
we forgot dessert.

18:36.149 --> 18:38.049
I need those pie pops!

18:38.051 --> 18:39.550
Munch, no!

18:39.552 --> 18:41.052
That stick could
puncture my...

18:41.054 --> 18:43.321
-Oh, uh...
-Suit.

18:49.596 --> 18:51.329
We found the thief!

18:53.266 --> 18:54.832
Minions, seize him!

18:54.834 --> 18:56.501
You'll never catch me!

18:57.904 --> 18:59.203
(squishing)

19:02.242 --> 19:03.975
Or-- Or maybe you will.

19:07.647 --> 19:09.514
Hello, friends and family!

19:11.251 --> 19:13.317
We're gonna be doing
speeches in just a minute,

19:13.319 --> 19:16.921
and I'm gonna get roasted
real good by my best man,
Terry the Clown.

19:16.923 --> 19:17.989
(horn beeps)

19:18.925 --> 19:21.592
But first, Liv Rooney.

19:21.594 --> 19:23.060
(applause)

19:25.031 --> 19:26.430
Hi, everybody.

19:26.432 --> 19:29.767
So, um, Gemma and Johnny
asked me to sing...

19:29.769 --> 19:32.537
(raspy voice) but unfortunately,
I am just losing my voice.
(coughs)

19:32.539 --> 19:34.639
(normal voice) See?

19:34.641 --> 19:38.776
But thankfully, we have
an amazing performer here
with us tonight.

19:38.778 --> 19:39.877
So...

19:45.885 --> 19:47.118
Hi.

19:48.788 --> 19:51.189
This is a song about love.

19:54.127 --> 20:00.298
♪ I tried on my own,
I thought I'd get there ♪

20:02.802 --> 20:06.037
♪ Around and around ♪

20:06.039 --> 20:09.540
♪ But I was
only getting nowhere ♪

20:13.313 --> 20:15.646
♪ Then you ♪

20:15.648 --> 20:19.684

20:19.686 --> 20:24.822

21:04.530 --> 21:05.963
(cheers and applause)

21:07.066 --> 21:08.466
Thank you.

21:14.140 --> 21:16.707
Wow.

21:16.709 --> 21:19.877
Maddie, you have never
looked at me the way
you look at him.

21:21.614 --> 21:22.713
Josh--

21:22.715 --> 21:24.482
Maddie, I saw it.

21:26.619 --> 21:30.888
Clearly, you and Diggie
have some unfinished business.

21:33.726 --> 21:35.293
Yeah, we do.

21:37.397 --> 21:39.330
Well, then you owe it
to yourself...

21:41.067 --> 21:42.533
to figure it all out.

21:47.140 --> 21:48.572
I'm really sorry.

21:49.942 --> 21:51.409
It's okay.

21:52.612 --> 21:53.878
I'll be all right.

22:02.789 --> 22:04.121
Who was that guy singing?

22:04.123 --> 22:05.990
Who cares?
We're married!

22:07.794 --> 22:10.328
I should probably tell you
about my hefty credit card debt.

22:10.330 --> 22:11.495
What's up?

22:14.667 --> 22:15.900
Hey.

22:17.103 --> 22:18.269
Hey.

22:21.174 --> 22:23.641
I'm gonna go tell Diggie
how great he sounded.

22:23.643 --> 22:25.509
-Diggie.
-Diggie!

22:25.511 --> 22:27.011
Both: No!

22:30.216 --> 22:32.016
So...

22:33.519 --> 22:35.119
'Sup?

22:36.356 --> 22:37.588
Stuff.

22:49.068 --> 22:50.468
Are you kidding me?

22:50.470 --> 22:52.403
Well played, Universe.

22:53.706 --> 22:55.039
That was well played.

23:00.313 --> 23:03.514
(sighs) Well, we got
the bride and groom off
to their honeymoon.

23:03.516 --> 23:05.049
Mom!

23:05.051 --> 23:07.818
We didn't get enough
to eat at the wedding.

23:08.821 --> 23:10.287
Mama's got your back.

23:13.893 --> 23:16.093
Thanks to my
Parker Purse Pockets.

23:21.033 --> 23:22.366
You got bisque?

23:22.368 --> 23:24.301
Mom, you're the best!

23:27.073 --> 23:29.106
I think I found
Grandma Nimbus' teeth.

23:31.444 --> 23:33.744
Artie:
<i>You can't fight the Smooneys.</i>
