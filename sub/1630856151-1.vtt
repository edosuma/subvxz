00:42.251 --> 00:46.004
<i>All your decorations will look lovely
on the Christmas tree.</i>

00:46.588 --> 00:50.050
If anybody needs help cutting out,
just raise your hand, okay?

00:58.851 --> 01:00.727
<i>Beautiful work, everyone.</i>

01:01.562 --> 01:05.190
Now, as it's your last day,
I'd like William

01:05.190 --> 01:08.068
to come up here and show
everyone what you've made.

01:11.822 --> 01:12.990
Don't be shy.

01:16.034 --> 01:17.286
Up you come.

01:17.911 --> 01:18.912
Go on.

01:36.180 --> 01:37.931
Well done, William.

01:37.931 --> 01:41.435
I think you should be the first to
put your new ornament on the tree.

01:41.435 --> 01:42.686
Come over, everyone.

02:00.913 --> 02:05.626
"Why did the little snowman get told off
for looking in a bag of carrots?"

02:05.626 --> 02:07.503
I don't know. Why?

02:07.503 --> 02:09.630
Because he was picking his nose.

02:11.548 --> 02:12.549
William.

02:15.636 --> 02:17.095
Good luck in your new home.

02:17.679 --> 02:18.931
We'll miss you.

02:21.266 --> 02:24.228
<i>Your new room is so big, William.</i>

02:24.770 --> 02:27.064
And we've got plenty of space
in the sitting room

02:27.064 --> 02:29.066
for a really big Christmas tree.

02:29.733 --> 02:32.653
We're going to have
a playroom for all of your things.

02:32.653 --> 02:34.488
And the garden is really something.

02:34.488 --> 02:37.783
There are fields at the bottom
and some woods there too.

02:37.783 --> 02:41.411
I bet you're looking forward to meeting
your new class and teachers, William.

02:41.411 --> 02:43.497
Your teacher is so nice.

02:43.497 --> 02:48.168
I bet all the boys and girls will be
really excited to have a new friend.

03:01.765 --> 03:02.933
Sir.

03:03.725 --> 03:07.062
Now then, are you gonna help us
shift some of these boxes, young man?

03:10.607 --> 03:12.276
Good afternoon, William.

03:12.276 --> 03:13.735
Momo!

03:14.278 --> 03:16.530
Tip. Watch the doorframe there.

03:16.530 --> 03:17.865
Hello, Mary.

03:17.865 --> 03:19.324
Afternoon, all.

03:19.324 --> 03:22.286
Let's give your parents
a few minutes to settle in

03:22.286 --> 03:24.997
and give you the chance to explore.

03:55.444 --> 03:57.154
It's so big, Momo.

03:57.154 --> 03:58.363
Exciting, isn't it?

03:58.363 --> 04:00.240
Lots of room for adventures.

04:10.542 --> 04:12.544
- We both play, actually.
- Really?

04:12.544 --> 04:14.671
Well, I try to play.

04:14.671 --> 04:16.298
She's cooking for 18 people.

04:16.298 --> 04:18.382
Do you want to come and build a snowman?

04:18.382 --> 04:20.052
Not right now, sweetheart.

04:20.052 --> 04:22.679
The children made them.
I do love this time of year.

04:22.679 --> 04:24.515
- Please, yes. Honestly.
- Caroline, did you say

04:24.515 --> 04:26.391
you're spending Christmas
with your mother?

04:26.391 --> 04:27.476
Yes.

05:22.781 --> 05:25.409
I'm William.
Would you like to play with me?

05:28.787 --> 05:31.373
My name is William.
Would you like to play?

05:51.435 --> 05:54.730
<i>Good King Wenceslas looked out</i>

05:54.730 --> 05:58.567
<i>On the Feast of Stephen</i>

05:58.567 --> 06:02.154
<i>When the snow lay round about</i>

06:02.154 --> 06:05.282
<i>Deep and crisp and even</i>

06:05.782 --> 06:09.411
<i>Brightly shone the moon that night</i>

06:09.411 --> 06:12.497
<i>Though the frost was cruel</i>

06:12.998 --> 06:16.502
<i>When a poor man came in sight</i>

06:16.502 --> 06:21.465
<i>Gathering winter fuel</i>

06:24.468 --> 06:27.596
<i>"Dear William,
We will miss you lots and lots</i>

06:27.596 --> 06:31.892
and wish you all the best
in your new home.

06:31.892 --> 06:36.438
Lots of love, Mary, Arthur, Bonnie,

06:36.438 --> 06:41.068
Paul, Lizzie, Jane, Alice, John."

06:47.115 --> 06:50.619
Lights-out now, William, please.
Big day tomorrow.

07:43.297 --> 07:44.131
Yes!

07:48.677 --> 07:50.012
Merry Christmas, my love.

07:50.012 --> 07:53.849
Merry Christmas, Momo.
You said I could get out of bed at 7:00.

07:53.849 --> 07:55.559
I've been waiting forever.

07:55.559 --> 07:57.186
You sure it's 7:00?

07:57.186 --> 07:58.687
I only heard six chimes.

07:58.687 --> 08:00.981
I counted seven, Momo. Honest!

08:00.981 --> 08:03.734
Well, if it's 7:00, I guess we should see
if Father Christmas has been.

08:03.734 --> 08:04.735
Yes!

08:06.320 --> 08:10.032
I wonder who this one is for.

08:18.081 --> 08:19.750
Merry Christmas, sweetheart.

08:21.502 --> 08:22.836
Hello, Rabbit.

08:32.179 --> 08:33.514
Rabbit.

08:45.859 --> 08:47.402
We made it, Rabbit.

08:57.120 --> 08:58.413
Yes.

08:59.665 --> 09:02.251
- Merry Christmas.
- Yeah. You all right?

09:03.418 --> 09:05.420
- Merry Christmas. Thank you, Vicar.
- Merry Christmas.

09:24.773 --> 09:25.774
Barely.

09:28.694 --> 09:30.571
Well, if you don't have to move...

09:31.071 --> 09:32.614
Come on, little one.

09:33.115 --> 09:34.533
Time for bed.

09:45.085 --> 09:46.086
W--

09:47.462 --> 09:48.463
Will do.

09:49.590 --> 09:51.258
Merry Christmas, love.

10:49.483 --> 10:52.486
Good evening and Merry Christmas.

10:53.028 --> 10:55.280
Welcome to the playroom.

10:55.280 --> 10:56.782
I'm the Wise Horse.

10:56.782 --> 10:57.908
Who are you?

10:57.908 --> 11:01.411
I'm-- Well, I'm a rabbit, I suppose.

11:02.412 --> 11:04.748
Who's there, Wise Horse?

11:04.748 --> 11:08.252
It's a new toy. A rabbit by all accounts.

11:14.508 --> 11:15.342
There we are.

11:15.342 --> 11:17.052
- Come on.
- Let me see.

11:17.052 --> 11:18.554
There we go.

11:22.015 --> 11:24.101
Doesn't look like much to me.

11:24.101 --> 11:26.019
What say you, Rabbit?

11:26.019 --> 11:27.855
Are you even real?

11:28.564 --> 11:29.815
How do you mean?

11:33.944 --> 11:36.947
I'm made of metal just like a real car.

11:36.947 --> 11:40.742
And see these small,
black circles at my sides?

11:40.742 --> 11:44.121
- Real cars have them as well.
- Oh, yeah.

11:44.121 --> 11:46.874
In the business, we call them wheels.

11:47.749 --> 11:48.834
Wheels.

11:49.585 --> 11:51.461
And last but not least--

11:51.461 --> 11:55.090
Lion, come and wind me up.

11:59.386 --> 12:02.848
I have a real, fully working motor.

12:02.848 --> 12:07.978
All the Boy needs to do is wind me up
and I zoom right past him.

12:10.689 --> 12:11.690
So fast.

12:12.274 --> 12:14.610
- Careful now.
- Watch out!

12:14.610 --> 12:16.028
Out of the way!

12:18.071 --> 12:19.698
That was a close one.

12:19.698 --> 12:22.201
Lion here is real too of course.

12:22.201 --> 12:24.369
Yes! Look at my legs.

12:24.369 --> 12:28.582
They're jointed like real lion legs
so I can pounce like a cat

12:28.582 --> 12:30.542
and sneak up on my prey.

12:32.377 --> 12:34.254
And I'm a real king.

12:34.254 --> 12:37.966
Look at my splendid clothes
and my splendid crown.

12:37.966 --> 12:41.637
These gemstones are real emeralds
and rubies--

12:41.637 --> 12:43.138
They're made of wood.

12:43.138 --> 12:47.434
How dare you speak to
the king of the playroom in that way?

12:47.434 --> 12:50.854
I demand that you bow before me,
you decrepit old beast.

12:52.856 --> 12:54.483
Or don't bow.

12:54.483 --> 12:58.862
I decree that the Wise Horse
does not have to bow.

12:58.862 --> 13:02.741
Forgive me, Wise Horse,
you know how carried away I get.

13:02.741 --> 13:04.368
It's these clothes.

13:04.368 --> 13:06.745
They're just so splendid.

13:08.664 --> 13:10.624
What do you make of this new toy?

13:10.624 --> 13:12.209
I don't like it.

13:12.709 --> 13:17.214
If we let this so-called rabbit
sleep in the toy box,

13:17.214 --> 13:20.717
there's a risk he'd be picked
to be bedtime toy.

13:21.802 --> 13:24.012
What's "bedtime toy"?

13:25.389 --> 13:26.390
Most nights,

13:26.390 --> 13:30.102
they pick a toy out of the toy box
for the Boy to take to bed with him.

13:30.102 --> 13:32.688
Where is the Boy? When will he be back?

13:32.688 --> 13:34.398
Enough questions!

13:34.398 --> 13:36.233
We have to make a decision.

13:36.233 --> 13:41.446
This toy has no moving parts
and no joints.

13:41.947 --> 13:44.283
I say we have nothing to do with him

13:44.283 --> 13:47.744
and that he is banished
to the far side of the playroom.

13:47.744 --> 13:50.539
- Come now. Leave the poor thing.
- Seconded!

13:50.539 --> 13:51.582
Agreed.

13:51.582 --> 13:52.749
Well then.

13:53.375 --> 13:58.589
Off you go to the far corner
where you can't be seen.

14:01.008 --> 14:02.092
Further!

14:04.595 --> 14:06.430
This is a--

14:07.014 --> 14:10.017
Back when I was new, there was a system.

14:10.017 --> 14:11.935
Toys respected their betters.

14:11.935 --> 14:13.812
It's disgraceful.

14:14.688 --> 14:17.232
- Can I go downstairs again?
- Come on now.

14:17.232 --> 14:19.985
Straight into bed, please.
You've had a full day.

14:19.985 --> 14:21.904
But I'm not tired.

14:21.904 --> 14:23.780
You were just fast asleep.

14:23.780 --> 14:25.616
But it's still Christmas.

14:25.616 --> 14:28.994
Can you get him some water, darling?
Then grab a bedtime toy.

14:36.376 --> 14:39.713
Wise Horse, what does "real" mean?

14:40.214 --> 14:42.674
Does it mean having bits
of you that move about or--

14:42.674 --> 14:45.135
Don't listen to the others, Rabbit.

14:45.135 --> 14:48.305
Being real isn't about
how you're put together.

14:48.305 --> 14:50.390
It's a thing that happens to you.

14:51.016 --> 14:55.145
When a child loves you for a long,
long time,

14:55.145 --> 14:56.688
not just to play with

14:56.688 --> 15:01.944
but really loves you,
then you become real.

15:02.611 --> 15:04.863
It's part of the magic of make-believe.

15:06.031 --> 15:07.366
Does it hurt?

15:08.700 --> 15:11.954
I suppose it does a little
because loved toys

15:11.954 --> 15:15.082
get so worn out
from all the adventures they go on.

15:15.999 --> 15:19.503
But believe me, it's worth it.

15:20.128 --> 15:24.883
When children love you,
they do it with all of their hearts.

15:26.635 --> 15:30.597
If there is a more beautiful feeling,
I do not know it.

15:33.475 --> 15:36.979
I should like to become real one day.

15:36.979 --> 15:40.774
Well, if the Boy loves you, then you will.

15:43.068 --> 15:43.902
Someone's coming.

15:43.902 --> 15:45.696
- Look out!
- Look out!

15:45.696 --> 15:46.989
It's time!

15:48.156 --> 15:49.324
You never know.

15:49.324 --> 15:52.077
- Move. Move.
- She's pushing me.

15:52.077 --> 15:53.579
Give me some room.

15:54.872 --> 15:55.914
Which toy?

15:55.914 --> 15:57.291
My rabbit!

15:59.168 --> 16:00.335
Perfect.

16:08.093 --> 16:09.344
Sweet dreams.

16:10.387 --> 16:11.388
Night night.

16:21.565 --> 16:22.983
Hello, Rabbit.

16:22.983 --> 16:24.902
Would you like to play with me?

16:27.070 --> 16:29.907
Great. I need someone
who's good at digging tunnels.

16:29.907 --> 16:34.369
And since you're a rabbit, I figured
you'll be the best person for the job.

16:35.579 --> 16:37.456
What are we waiting for then?

16:45.714 --> 16:46.715
Wow.

16:47.216 --> 16:50.427
Rabbit,
you're the best digger I have ever seen.

16:50.427 --> 16:53.722
We must be a million miles
underground already.

16:53.722 --> 16:55.599
We need to be careful.

16:55.599 --> 16:59.019
The earth is dry and the tunnel
could collapse at any moment.

16:59.520 --> 17:01.939
Us rabbits know about such things.

17:03.815 --> 17:08.194
By my calculations, we're about halfway.

17:09.363 --> 17:10.489
Where are we going?

17:10.489 --> 17:12.115
We're going to Chisup.

17:12.115 --> 17:14.034
It's where I used to live.

17:14.034 --> 17:15.618
All my friends are there.

17:17.954 --> 17:19.957
I don't have any friends here.

17:22.291 --> 17:23.417
You have me.

17:25.170 --> 17:26.380
You're right.

17:26.380 --> 17:30.467
You're my new friend,
which means you're my best friend too.

17:32.219 --> 17:36.306
Gosh, I've never been anyone's
best friend before.

17:41.979 --> 17:45.816
Look how fast we're digging.
We'll be there in no time.

17:48.443 --> 17:49.528
I've hit something.

17:58.370 --> 18:01.123
A treasure map!

18:02.416 --> 18:03.417
Wow.

18:04.793 --> 18:05.794
What's that?

18:06.545 --> 18:07.921
The tunnel!

18:07.921 --> 18:09.006
It's collapsing.

18:09.798 --> 18:12.384
Quick, Rabbit, we need to get out of here.

18:12.384 --> 18:13.760
Hold on to me.

18:16.847 --> 18:20.309
- We're not gonna make it!
- We will. We're almost there.

18:22.102 --> 18:23.270
We made it, Rabbit.

18:24.104 --> 18:25.189
We're safe.

18:29.193 --> 18:30.861
Now that we're best friends,

18:30.861 --> 18:35.699
we'll have to go looking
for that treasure together.

18:52.508 --> 18:55.886
<i>Class, there's someone
I'd like to introduce you to.</i>

18:58.013 --> 19:01.975
William, could you come up here, please?

19:03.477 --> 19:04.478
Come on.

19:16.823 --> 19:19.117
Class, say hello to William.

19:19.117 --> 19:21.411
Hello, William.

19:22.079 --> 19:26.291
William, would you like to say a few words
about yourself to everyone?

19:36.593 --> 19:39.096
That's okay, William.
You can sit down now.

19:41.598 --> 19:44.685
So, last week we were talking
about autumn.

19:44.685 --> 19:47.563
Can anyone remember
what happens in the autumn?

19:52.234 --> 19:53.527
Hello.

19:53.527 --> 19:55.654
Aren't you the boy from next door?

19:56.989 --> 19:58.657
Do you want to come play with us?

20:01.493 --> 20:03.328
Leave him, Lucy. Come and play.

20:11.879 --> 20:14.923
Quick! Let's storm the castle
while the drawbridge is down.

20:14.923 --> 20:16.925
I think the treasure's in the throne room.

20:16.925 --> 20:19.219
William, lunch is ready.

20:24.099 --> 20:25.392
More lettuce?

20:25.392 --> 20:26.810
I'm full too.

20:26.810 --> 20:33.609
But no matter how much I eat,
Momo always makes me eat two more bites.

20:33.609 --> 20:37.362
Listen,
I've got a plan to find the treasure.

20:38.238 --> 20:39.615
We need some magic.

20:40.115 --> 20:42.492
George says fairies live out there.

20:42.492 --> 20:46.121
If you want to meet one,
you have to build a little house for them.

20:47.247 --> 20:48.248
Momo.

20:48.749 --> 20:51.210
Rabbit and I have finished.
Can we go and play again?

20:51.210 --> 20:52.920
Have two more bites.

20:56.632 --> 20:57.883
Proper bites.

21:12.272 --> 21:15.359
So, this is an official fairy house.

21:15.359 --> 21:18.570
All we have to do now
is say a fairy blessing.

21:21.406 --> 21:24.660
Fairies flutter, twinkle and fly.

21:25.577 --> 21:29.164
Come to this garden, above is the sky.

21:29.164 --> 21:34.253
Fearless William and Rabbit say,
"Alakazam. Alakazoo!

21:34.253 --> 21:37.548
We need your magic, so do come here, do!"

21:39.091 --> 21:41.468
Now, when we least expect it,

21:41.468 --> 21:45.097
a magic fairy will appear
and help us find the treasure.

21:51.186 --> 21:52.354
<i>Night night, Momo.</i>

21:53.897 --> 21:57.401
Gosh, look at that rabbit.
Let me take him away and sew him up.

21:57.401 --> 21:59.736
No! You can't, Momo.

21:59.736 --> 22:01.071
You can't take Rabbit.

22:01.071 --> 22:02.447
All right, all right.

22:02.447 --> 22:03.949
Goodness me.

22:03.949 --> 22:06.201
I was only gonna fix him up a little.

22:06.201 --> 22:07.828
All this fuss over a toy.

22:07.828 --> 22:10.372
He's not a toy, Momo. He's real.

22:10.372 --> 22:13.000
Okay, if you say so.

22:14.418 --> 22:15.502
Night night.

22:30.809 --> 22:32.186
<i>The Boy?</i>

22:32.186 --> 22:33.437
Yes.

22:33.437 --> 22:35.814
Said you're real?

22:36.440 --> 22:37.774
Yes.

22:37.774 --> 22:39.985
- You?
- Yes.

22:39.985 --> 22:42.571
Do you feel any different?

22:42.571 --> 22:44.239
I don't know.

22:44.239 --> 22:46.074
I don't think so.

22:46.074 --> 22:50.162
You look the same as you did before.
You look like a toy.

22:50.162 --> 22:53.790
But you're all toys,
and you say you're real.

22:53.790 --> 22:56.043
Yes, but we don't mean it.

22:56.043 --> 22:58.212
We are just pretending.

22:58.212 --> 23:03.800
And at least we resemble something
of what we're supposed to be.

23:04.301 --> 23:05.928
The lion has a mane.

23:05.928 --> 23:08.138
- The king has a crown.
- Oh, well, yeah.

23:08.138 --> 23:09.348
Look at you.

23:09.348 --> 23:11.475
You look shabby.

23:12.142 --> 23:14.311
- You've been torn.
- Yeah. Yep, yep.

23:14.311 --> 23:19.525
And I hate to say it,
but I think I can see your stuffing.

23:19.525 --> 23:23.779
He's filled with--
My goodness! What are you filled with?

23:24.988 --> 23:30.202
In all my years, what kind of toy
does not have regulation innards?

23:30.202 --> 23:35.040
How on earth can you be real
when you're such a mess?

23:35.040 --> 23:36.291
Enough.

23:36.291 --> 23:39.628
What do any of you know
about what it means to be real?

23:39.628 --> 23:41.547
The Boy knows best,

23:41.547 --> 23:46.051
and if he says the rabbit is real,
then he is.

23:46.969 --> 23:48.136
Someone's coming.

23:49.930 --> 23:52.850
Rabbit,
I know the fairy spell didn't work,

23:52.850 --> 23:55.060
but we can't wait any longer.

23:55.936 --> 23:58.939
We need to find the treasure
before someone else does.

24:00.482 --> 24:03.110
I think it's in the enchanted forest.

24:37.895 --> 24:39.605
I saw it move, Rabbit.

24:39.605 --> 24:41.899
I swear I saw something.

24:52.659 --> 24:53.660
No!

24:54.161 --> 24:56.496
I don't think
it's that much of a problem, is it?

24:56.496 --> 24:58.290
What's that, Rabbit?

24:58.290 --> 25:00.459
But he's always on his own.

25:01.251 --> 25:03.086
That can't be good for him.

25:03.086 --> 25:04.588
It's not just me.

25:04.588 --> 25:06.632
His teachers have noticed it too.

25:07.216 --> 25:09.259
Making friends takes time.

25:09.259 --> 25:10.761
It's been months.

25:10.761 --> 25:12.846
How much longer can we leave it?

25:13.722 --> 25:15.891
He seems happy enough with his rabbit.

25:15.891 --> 25:18.477
He doesn't have any real friends.

25:35.160 --> 25:38.121
What type of treasure is it
that we're looking for?

25:38.121 --> 25:39.456
Is it gold?

25:39.456 --> 25:40.749
Or jewels?

25:41.291 --> 25:42.835
Or chocolate bars?

25:43.627 --> 25:46.630
No, I don't think
it's any of those things.

25:47.214 --> 25:50.926
I'm not sure what it is,
but I think we'll know it when we see it.

25:53.262 --> 25:54.680
We need to be quiet.

25:54.680 --> 25:58.141
The forest is full of dangerous animals.

25:58.684 --> 26:01.645
We rabbits communicate without speaking.

26:01.645 --> 26:06.900
For example, when we sense danger,
we stamp our foot like this.

26:13.031 --> 26:14.199
We also do this.

26:16.535 --> 26:17.953
What does that mean?

26:17.953 --> 26:22.457
Well, it means hello
and it also means goodbye.

26:23.333 --> 26:25.252
Hello and goodbye are the same thing?

26:25.252 --> 26:30.090
Right, because when you say goodbye
to one thing, you say hello to another.

26:30.757 --> 26:33.969
Every ending is just the beginning
of something new.

26:38.182 --> 26:41.935
You already did that one.
It means something dangerous is--

26:42.436 --> 26:43.562
Run!

26:50.444 --> 26:53.155
Leave me behind. Save yourself.

26:53.155 --> 26:54.239
Never!

27:00.204 --> 27:02.247
Oh, no. We're trapped.

27:06.919 --> 27:07.836
Hold on.

27:14.259 --> 27:16.261
That was incredible.

27:16.261 --> 27:18.514
I cannot believe you did that.

27:18.514 --> 27:21.517
- Yes! We did it, Rabbit.
- You did it.

27:24.520 --> 27:25.729
Are you okay?

27:25.729 --> 27:26.813
I'm fine.

27:37.115 --> 27:38.367
William!

27:40.702 --> 27:42.079
Are you all right?

27:52.923 --> 27:54.091
Come see.

27:56.134 --> 27:59.596
- Who are you?
- What are you?

27:59.596 --> 28:01.723
I'm a rabbit. Just like you.

28:02.933 --> 28:06.395
Well, you don't look like a rabbit.
You look like a toy.

28:07.729 --> 28:11.316
I was a toy rabbit,
but now I'm a real rabbit.

28:12.776 --> 28:15.279
When a child loves you, you turn real.

28:15.988 --> 28:18.824
That's how the magic
of make-believe works.

28:20.784 --> 28:22.578
Well, can you move about?

28:22.578 --> 28:25.539
Well, not really.

28:26.623 --> 28:27.791
Can you hop?

28:29.459 --> 28:32.045
It doesn't have proper legs.

28:32.754 --> 28:36.091
How can you be a real rabbit
if you can't hop?

28:37.509 --> 28:38.927
I don't know.

28:39.428 --> 28:42.890
You say you become real
if a child loves you.

28:42.890 --> 28:47.102
Well, how can you know for sure
if this child of yours does love you?

28:48.228 --> 28:49.563
Did it say so?

28:50.606 --> 28:52.691
No, he said I was real.

28:54.318 --> 28:55.319
But I just thought--

28:55.319 --> 28:59.072
If he loved you,
why would he leave you out here?

28:59.072 --> 29:00.699
In the cold.

29:03.076 --> 29:04.077
Come on.

29:04.077 --> 29:05.495
It'll soon be dark.

29:06.038 --> 29:09.082
- We'd better head back to the warren.
- Good luck.

29:09.082 --> 29:10.918
Good luck to you, toy rabbit.

29:11.418 --> 29:12.794
Poor thing.

29:35.442 --> 29:37.152
What are you doing out here?

29:38.612 --> 29:41.156
Come on. Back to where you belong.

29:48.497 --> 29:50.207
Where have you been, Rabbit?

29:52.000 --> 29:53.669
The Boy left me outside.

29:54.795 --> 29:59.424
Real rabbits came
and said that I was still just a toy.

30:00.884 --> 30:02.386
I think maybe they were right.

30:03.762 --> 30:10.185
Maybe the Boy doesn't love me
and that's why I'm still not real.

30:11.645 --> 30:14.523
The Boy's very sick, Rabbit.

30:14.523 --> 30:17.150
What? How do you mean?

30:17.150 --> 30:19.862
He's in bed with a high fever.

30:20.362 --> 30:23.866
We overheard the doctor talking
to the Boy's mother about it last night.

30:23.866 --> 30:26.660
But the Boy will be okay, won't he?

30:26.660 --> 30:28.203
He'll be all right.

30:28.203 --> 30:32.249
His uncle had something similar
many years ago.

30:32.249 --> 30:34.293
He almost didn't make it through.

30:35.210 --> 30:36.503
Many don't.

30:37.963 --> 30:39.840
There's something else, Rabbit.

30:41.008 --> 30:42.759
When his uncle was ill,

30:42.759 --> 30:47.264
afterwards they burned everything
he had recently touched.

30:47.264 --> 30:49.224
On the doctor's orders.

30:49.224 --> 30:52.227
They do it to stop the illness
spreading to others.

30:52.728 --> 30:57.024
So, tonight when they come in for a toy,
you must hide.

30:57.024 --> 31:01.528
For if you don't and you get picked,
then that's the end for you.

31:02.154 --> 31:03.572
Do you understand?

31:07.659 --> 31:09.661
Look. The doctor.

31:11.288 --> 31:12.956
- Thank you for coming.
- Of course.

31:26.845 --> 31:29.056
I have to be honest with you. He's--

31:31.016 --> 31:32.184
He's very sick.

31:33.644 --> 31:35.145
Will he be all right?

31:36.813 --> 31:39.441
I'm sorry. It's touch and go.

31:40.442 --> 31:42.528
It's going to be a difficult night.

31:42.528 --> 31:44.446
He needs you to be strong for him.

31:46.907 --> 31:47.908
I'll--

31:50.827 --> 31:53.038
I'll go and get him a bedtime toy.

32:08.262 --> 32:10.055
She's coming. Hide.

32:10.055 --> 32:11.306
Get out of here.

32:11.306 --> 32:12.599
She's coming.

32:13.475 --> 32:16.186
Rabbit, you must move.

32:16.186 --> 32:20.315
If she takes you into that room
then you'll be thrown on the bonfire.

32:20.315 --> 32:25.362
On all of our adventures together,
he never once left me behind.

32:26.572 --> 32:28.907
So I shan't leave him.

32:28.907 --> 32:32.619
Rabbit, please come to your senses.

32:32.619 --> 32:34.621
It'll be the end for you.

32:35.372 --> 32:38.667
I mean, you said it yourself,
the Boy left you outside.

32:39.501 --> 32:42.045
Maybe he didn't love you after all.

32:44.673 --> 32:49.928
That may be true, but I love him.

33:16.121 --> 33:17.915
Here's your favorite, my love.

33:32.471 --> 33:34.306
Is that you, Rabbit?

33:35.766 --> 33:36.975
It's me.

33:41.939 --> 33:43.148
I'm scared.

33:44.107 --> 33:45.317
I know.

33:45.943 --> 33:47.152
So am I.

33:48.403 --> 33:50.322
I wish I was more brave.

33:50.322 --> 33:52.491
I've always wished that.

33:52.491 --> 33:54.576
How could you be more brave?

33:54.576 --> 33:59.581
On all of our adventures together,
you were always the one who saved the day.

33:59.581 --> 34:01.375
You never left me behind.

34:02.334 --> 34:04.670
You mustn't wish to be different.

34:04.670 --> 34:07.172
You're perfect the way you are.

34:08.130 --> 34:10.384
Do you really think I'm brave?

34:11.009 --> 34:13.136
The very bravest.

34:18.225 --> 34:22.603
My parents say we can go to the seaside
when I get better.

34:22.603 --> 34:24.731
Won't that be nice?

34:24.731 --> 34:27.025
Maybe we'll find the treasure there.

34:28.025 --> 34:30.279
Maybe it's buried in the sand.

34:31.071 --> 34:32.989
We don't need to find the treasure.

34:33.782 --> 34:35.701
I've found the treasure already.

34:36.994 --> 34:38.661
I love you, Rabbit.

34:40.038 --> 34:41.456
I love you too.

34:59.391 --> 35:02.895
Get the windows open throughout the house.
Get some fresh air in here.

35:02.895 --> 35:05.564
I was planning on making soup for him
for lunch, Doctor.

35:05.564 --> 35:07.733
- Would that be all right?
- That's perfect.

35:09.776 --> 35:13.447
Now, everything that was near William when
he was contagious will have to be burned.

35:13.447 --> 35:15.157
We don't want this illness
being passed on.

35:15.157 --> 35:18.410
So, sheets, pajamas, toys, everything.

35:24.917 --> 35:26.752
Good job you're here today, George.

35:26.752 --> 35:28.587
That's all for the bonfire.

35:30.255 --> 35:31.298
I'll see to it now.

35:32.257 --> 35:33.467
I'll get me matches.

35:34.176 --> 35:36.303
I'm glad little William's on the mend.

35:37.137 --> 35:39.306
Won't be an hour
till he's causing mischief again.

35:39.806 --> 35:41.433
Well, as it should be.

35:41.433 --> 35:44.645
- Now, I'll get this fire started.
- Thanks, George.

35:44.645 --> 35:46.230
Turned chilly now, eh?

35:55.155 --> 35:57.282
<i>No! No!</i>

35:57.282 --> 35:59.243
Please, don't upset yourself, my love.

35:59.243 --> 36:00.661
I'm not upset!

36:00.661 --> 36:01.954
Where is he?

36:02.829 --> 36:04.039
It's his rabbit.

36:04.039 --> 36:05.791
He wants to know where it is.

36:08.836 --> 36:09.837
William.

36:14.758 --> 36:15.759
Rabbit's gone.

36:16.468 --> 36:18.303
What do you mean? Where is he?

36:18.303 --> 36:22.808
He was all old and worn,
so we had to throw him out.

36:22.808 --> 36:24.393
Why did you do that?

36:24.393 --> 36:26.270
Look, if you're a good boy,

36:26.270 --> 36:28.605
maybe Father Christmas
will bring you a new toy.

36:28.605 --> 36:32.985
I don't want a new toy, I want my rabbit.
I want my rabbit back.

37:03.056 --> 37:04.308
What day is it?

37:05.142 --> 37:07.186
Oh, my, my.

37:07.978 --> 37:09.354
Winter already?

37:09.354 --> 37:11.190
I think I overslept.

37:13.275 --> 37:15.110
Who are you?

37:15.110 --> 37:19.948
I'm the Playroom Fairy, in charge
of make-believe magic and suchlike.

37:20.741 --> 37:24.369
My job is to take care of the toys
that are no longer needed

37:24.953 --> 37:26.955
when they're old or worn out.

37:28.749 --> 37:30.000
Why are you crying?

37:31.835 --> 37:36.381
I'm sad because I'm going to miss the Boy.

37:36.924 --> 37:39.343
Because I'll never play with him again.

37:41.011 --> 37:45.057
I'm sad because I thought
I'd become real if he loved me.

37:47.768 --> 37:49.811
But maybe he never did.

37:49.811 --> 37:51.688
Of course he loved you.

37:52.397 --> 37:57.277
My goodness, he loved you as much
as it's possible to love another.

37:57.277 --> 37:59.947
Then why didn't I become real?

38:00.489 --> 38:03.659
You don't become real
by making someone love you.

38:04.493 --> 38:09.957
You become real when you act
with unconditional love and with kindness.

38:11.124 --> 38:12.876
Like you did last night.

38:15.128 --> 38:16.880
So I'm real now?

38:18.882 --> 38:24.847
But if I'm real, why don't
I have thick fur and proper legs?

38:25.764 --> 38:27.432
And why can't I hop?

38:27.933 --> 38:32.354
Good gracious, where on earth
do you toys get your ideas from?

38:33.021 --> 38:36.441
Being real is not about how you look.

38:37.025 --> 38:39.403
It's about what's in your heart.

38:40.612 --> 38:44.032
You loved the Boy, and the Boy loved you.

38:45.075 --> 38:46.910
Look at you, for heaven's sake.

38:47.619 --> 38:50.038
Look how worn out with love you are.

38:51.748 --> 38:54.376
Some of the other toys say I'm very ugly.

38:55.335 --> 38:57.921
Then they don't know
what it is to be beautiful.

38:59.131 --> 39:04.261
Now, I have a reward for you
for being such a good toy.

39:39.254 --> 39:41.965
Now then, William. It's eight o'clock.

39:42.925 --> 39:46.053
I thought I'd hear you tearing downstairs
at one minute past 7:00.

39:47.888 --> 39:50.390
Come on. Let me see a smile.

39:51.183 --> 39:52.351
It's Christmas.

39:52.851 --> 39:55.646
You've gotta smile
on Christmas Day. It's the rules.

39:56.897 --> 39:57.940
That's it.

39:58.815 --> 40:00.400
Now, come on.

40:01.777 --> 40:04.196
Feels heavy. I wonder what it could be.

40:20.629 --> 40:23.549
Why don't you put your coat and boots on
and take it outside?

40:24.049 --> 40:25.467
See if you can fly it.

41:15.058 --> 41:16.268
Hello, Rabbit.

42:09.738 --> 42:11.156
Goodbye, Rabbit.

42:14.701 --> 42:15.702
Thank you.

42:36.765 --> 42:39.017
Hello, my name is William.

42:39.017 --> 42:40.561
Would you like to play?
