01:03.497 --> 01:06.365
We want to thank everyone
for coming out today

01:06.367 --> 01:10.135
to share your thoughts
and fight so passionately

01:10.137 --> 01:10.736
for our schools.

01:10.738 --> 01:13.072
No part of this
process has been easy

01:13.074 --> 01:15.808
or was ever taken lightly.

01:15.810 --> 01:16.508
Bullshit!

01:16.510 --> 01:18.444
These are children,
you should be ashamed!

-[gavel bangs]

01:21.549 --> 01:22.481
Ma'am, please.

01:22.483 --> 01:25.551
The fact remains that
too many of our schools

01:25.553 --> 01:26.785
are financially failing

01:26.787 --> 01:29.088
and in an alarming
state of disrepair.

01:29.090 --> 01:33.492
Our first priority must always
be to keep our students safe.

01:33.494 --> 01:36.595
With that in mind,
the board has voted

01:36.597 --> 01:41.400
to close and integrate
the following 23 schools.

To the end of an era.

02:44.899 --> 02:46.231
Not in the mood.

02:46.233 --> 02:49.535
Fine, then to new beginnings.

02:49.737 --> 02:51.570
You already got
something, didn't you?

02:51.572 --> 02:54.306
Let's just say charm goes
a long way at Immaculate Heart.

02:54.308 --> 02:57.910
[scoffs] Immaculate Heart,
wow, look at you.

02:57.912 --> 03:02.247
Yeah, they seemed really excited
to meet a real, live Jew.

03:02.249 --> 03:03.649
Whatever, I'll take it.

03:03.651 --> 03:04.716
So, what are you thinking?

03:04.718 --> 03:06.718
I hear Whitman needs
a new history teacher.

03:06.720 --> 03:11.190
-Rent is due tomorrow.
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, back up.

03:11.192 --> 03:11.957
You teach English.

03:11.959 --> 03:13.592
Relax, I'll just brush up on it.

03:13.594 --> 03:15.294
-OK, then Whitman?
-Did you forget already?

03:15.296 --> 03:20.232
23 schools just closed, I'll
be lucky if Whitman takes me.

03:20.234 --> 03:21.466
OK, I'm sorry.

03:21.468 --> 03:23.435
I'm gonna get you
into Immaculate Heart.

03:23.437 --> 03:25.671
It'll take some
maneuvering, but I will.

03:25.673 --> 03:26.972
-Until then--
-What are you doing?

03:26.974 --> 03:31.276
[Kate] I am bequeathing you one
of my most prized possessions.

03:31.278 --> 03:32.878
Ah-ha!

03:32.880 --> 03:35.414
Your favorite pepper
spray, it's adorable,

03:35.416 --> 03:38.917
but don't forget,
I'm not a rookie.

03:38.919 --> 03:42.821
I mean, how bad could it be?

Sorry.

03:52.466 --> 03:53.732
Don't you just love first days?

03:53.734 --> 03:54.933

03:54.935 --> 03:57.703

03:57.705 --> 04:00.439
Any advice for
my first day here?

04:00.441 --> 04:01.740
Nice, I was about to ask you.

04:01.742 --> 04:04.443
I'm from Lamberton High,
rest in peace.

04:04.445 --> 04:07.379
So, let's see,
first days are tough.

04:07.381 --> 04:09.781
Suddenly, I'm teaching
10th grade math

04:09.783 --> 04:11.450
after a career as
a science teacher,

04:11.452 --> 04:12.851
but none of that's
advice, is it?

04:12.853 --> 04:16.421
All right, well I'll have
to get back to you on that.

04:16.423 --> 04:17.990
Thanks.

04:17.992 --> 04:20.024
All that before 8:00 a.m.

04:21.362 --> 04:22.861
[Mark] Jeez.

04:23.831 --> 04:26.265

-Watch it, Fishtown.
-What'd you say to me?

04:55.929 --> 04:57.863
I said, move first before I
slap the shit out your fat ass.

OK, first things first.

05:07.975 --> 05:11.410
Does everyone have
their trans pass?

05:11.412 --> 05:13.345
I know some of you have
a longer commute now,

05:13.347 --> 05:17.883
but this card means you have
no excuse not to be here.

05:17.885 --> 05:22.054
Hey, sorry I'm late.
I need mine.

05:22.056 --> 05:24.356
Oh, sure.

I think you're smart enough to
use better language than that.

05:50.517 --> 05:51.783
Revise it.

05:51.785 --> 05:53.985
All right.

05:56.724 --> 05:59.524

One of those days, huh?

07:21.675 --> 07:22.841
Yeah.

I got a new local crafty,
you'll like it, it's strong.

How was your first week?

Let me see... a fire, three kids
arrested and a cafeteria fight.
You tell me.

08:08.789 --> 08:12.057
I'll see those,
and raise you 55 kids

08:12.059 --> 08:13.892
in my second period class.

08:13.894 --> 08:14.993
55, can they do that?

08:14.995 --> 08:18.497
Not contractually,
but that would suggest

08:18.499 --> 08:19.664
we actually have a contract.

08:19.666 --> 08:22.067

You're a rugger, I knew there
was something I liked about you.

08:32.279 --> 08:33.078
Do you play?

08:33.080 --> 08:34.779
Yeah, at my last school
I started a rugby program

08:34.780 --> 08:37.048
with a friend of mine who,
when the school closed,

08:37.049 --> 08:39.784
went on to big
time rugby coaching

08:39.785 --> 08:41.586
and... I'm here.

08:41.587 --> 08:43.889
I've been playing
since I could walk.

08:43.890 --> 08:47.993
I would go to all of my
dad's games when he coached.

08:49.062 --> 08:50.762
Where are you from again?

08:50.764 --> 08:52.130

You're little Cassey,
aren't you?

08:58.171 --> 09:02.307
Oh my, your dad, your dad
gave me my first coaching job.

09:02.309 --> 09:03.742
I remember when
you were adopted.

09:03.744 --> 09:08.113
Everyone was so excited,
oh my god, I am so old.

09:08.115 --> 09:13.852
Your dad was the best mentor
I had in my entire life.

09:13.987 --> 09:15.954
Dad was happiest
when he was playing,

09:15.956 --> 09:17.956
but even happier
when he was coaching.

09:17.958 --> 09:21.560
-Totally.
-I miss him.

-Go!

09:39.112 --> 09:43.648
Turn those phones off, do
you want detention later?

09:46.987 --> 09:47.819
Wow.

09:47.821 --> 09:51.222
That's why my friend KJ
and I started the team,

09:51.224 --> 09:52.057
as an outlet.

09:52.059 --> 09:54.593
Moved the scrum from
the hallway to the field

09:54.595 --> 09:56.962
and the results,
they were incredible.

09:56.964 --> 10:01.333
It's a crime that
program was cut short.

10:01.335 --> 10:03.602
When I started my
college team at LaSalle,

10:03.604 --> 10:07.672
it was like a steam
valve for frustrations.

10:07.674 --> 10:10.842
I was focused,
it improved my grades.

10:10.844 --> 10:11.643
Yeah.

10:11.645 --> 10:13.878
A lot of great memories.

10:16.116 --> 10:18.083
Speaking of memories,
how's your mom?

10:18.085 --> 10:21.286
Love that lady,
she was at every game.

10:21.288 --> 10:23.088
I wouldn't know.

10:23.357 --> 10:28.727
So, what does Mrs. Nolin
think of you out drinking
on a school night?

10:28.729 --> 10:32.030
Ah, I've been
divorced for years.

10:32.032 --> 10:35.834
This guy doesn't have
a curfew anymore.

10:37.838 --> 10:40.972
I think Whitman this year
is gonna kick my ass.

10:40.974 --> 10:45.110
-I'm too old. I am.
-[laughs] No.

10:45.379 --> 10:46.378
I gotta stay positive.

10:46.380 --> 10:49.114
-Yes.
-Here's to staying positive.

10:49.116 --> 10:51.049
New friends,

10:51.218 --> 10:54.819
your father, and rugby.

10:55.922 --> 10:56.955
Rugby.

10:56.957 --> 11:03.061
[audience cheers on TV]

11:14.741 --> 11:17.442
[Kate] What do you mean you're
gonna start a rugby team?

11:17.444 --> 11:18.777
I'm gonna try.

11:18.779 --> 11:22.447
So how much will we be
getting for this gig?

11:24.685 --> 11:26.718
-Hmm?
-Nothing?

11:26.720 --> 11:30.455
You don't have enough on your
plate relearning history?

11:30.457 --> 11:31.690
Seriously, why?

11:31.692 --> 11:34.793
Because I'm a good teacher,
but even better at rugby

11:34.795 --> 11:38.863
and my kids aren't set up with
a cappuccino machine like yours.

11:38.865 --> 11:40.999
Maybe I can start like
a barista team there.

11:41.001 --> 11:44.836
Just don't get
too attached to that place.

11:44.838 --> 11:46.371
Yep.

11:47.040 --> 11:49.908
No. Are
you frickin' kiddin'?

11:49.910 --> 11:51.710
We can barely buy
books around here.

11:51.712 --> 11:52.911
But the great thing about rugby

11:52.913 --> 11:54.412
is that it's
a zero equipment game.

11:54.414 --> 11:56.848
All the kids need
is a ball and a field.

11:56.850 --> 11:58.450
Oh really, that's all
you think they need?

11:58.452 --> 12:01.019
They also need a safe place
to push their boundaries.

12:01.021 --> 12:03.722
We have a very big
football team for that.

12:03.724 --> 12:04.956
We do. Too big.

12:04.958 --> 12:07.892
We just combined three
schools, two full teams

12:07.894 --> 12:09.360
of football players
are now screwed.

12:09.362 --> 12:11.196
An unfortunate side
effect of the closures.

12:11.198 --> 12:14.132
Exactly.
Which means less opportunities

12:14.134 --> 12:15.433
for college and scholarships.

12:15.435 --> 12:17.102
A lot of great rugby
scholarships out there.

12:17.104 --> 12:21.306
I can't even remember when
our graduation rate passed 60%

12:21.308 --> 12:22.440
and you're talking scholarships.

12:22.442 --> 12:24.242
Let's change that percentage.

12:24.244 --> 12:26.177
We hired you to teach,
not coach.

12:26.179 --> 12:28.079
Yes, but isn't it
our responsibility

12:28.081 --> 12:30.482
to challenge them
to try new things?

12:30.484 --> 12:35.086
Take the scrum from the
hallways to the field?

12:35.522 --> 12:39.791
"Scrum," I'll assume
that's a rugby term.

12:39.793 --> 12:41.226
Yes.

12:41.228 --> 12:44.195
Mr. Nolin, you equally
committed to this?

12:44.197 --> 12:45.830
Dr. Wade, when
I was a young man,

12:45.832 --> 12:50.034
I coached with Mac's dad,
and it changed my life.

12:50.036 --> 12:54.239
If it does half as much for
these boys as it did for me,

12:54.241 --> 12:56.407
I want to be a part of it.

12:58.445 --> 13:01.212
Well, let's see if you can
get any interest first.

13:01.214 --> 13:03.348
Trying new things is not
the status quo around here.

13:03.350 --> 13:07.786
-Now out.
-So, that means you'll get
approval from the school board.

13:07.788 --> 13:09.087
I'll see what I can do.

13:09.089 --> 13:10.455
-So, that's a yes?
-Get out.

13:10.457 --> 13:11.356
-OK.
-Shoo.

13:11.358 --> 13:14.993
-[laughs] Thank you.
-Thank you.

13:24.271 --> 13:26.805
Rugby, guys?
There's a role for everybody.

13:26.807 --> 13:30.875
Hey... rugby?
Come on, man, it's fun.

13:30.877 --> 13:32.377
Rugby.

13:32.379 --> 13:34.846
Hey, first of all, hood off.

13:34.848 --> 13:38.216
You interested?
Take a look. No?

13:38.218 --> 13:39.551
All right, give that back.

13:39.553 --> 13:41.586
These things were not cheap.

13:41.588 --> 13:43.555
Rugby... no?

13:45.225 --> 13:47.058
Rugby, three o'clock...
Nope? OK.

13:47.060 --> 13:50.829
Are you sure? You'd be perfect.
Come on, bro, you're fast.

13:50.831 --> 13:52.864
Come on, you got
the hairdo for it.

13:52.866 --> 13:57.068
Rugby, it's room 23,
three o'clock.

13:57.838 --> 13:59.070
Rugby.

13:59.072 --> 14:01.973
Rugby...
Yes, thank you.

14:02.209 --> 14:05.577
[bell rings]

14:12.552 --> 14:13.384
[students laugh]

14:13.386 --> 14:17.989
You'll get your
pass after class.

14:19.626 --> 14:21.359
-Rugby?
-Yeah.

14:21.361 --> 14:22.927
It's kind of like soccer,
ain't it?

14:22.929 --> 14:26.931
Nah, it's like a wussy
British version of football.

14:26.933 --> 14:27.932
[students laugh]

14:27.934 --> 14:30.368
Rugby is neither of those.

14:30.370 --> 14:32.270
I'm too small for football.

14:32.272 --> 14:34.105
I just said it isn't football.

14:34.107 --> 14:35.240
And it's not just for bigs.

14:35.242 --> 14:38.443
Fast kids are
important on the wings

14:38.445 --> 14:43.248
and we can use someone with
your specific set of skills.

14:43.250 --> 14:45.450
[students laugh]

14:45.452 --> 14:47.218
Think about it.

14:50.290 --> 14:51.990
Hey, I ain't wearin'
no short shorts.

14:51.992 --> 14:53.591
Well, if you don't want
someone yanking on them

14:53.593 --> 14:56.661
when they tackle you,
you're gonna wanna wear 'em.

14:56.663 --> 14:58.229
I ain't got no
money for no cleats.

14:58.231 --> 15:03.534
Listen, if money is an issue,
then you have no issue.

15:03.536 --> 15:05.603
We'll figure it out.

15:29.062 --> 15:31.129
-OK.
-Yes!

15:32.365 --> 15:33.131
Thank you.

15:33.133 --> 15:34.365
-All right, all right.
-Sorry.

15:34.367 --> 15:36.367
Look, you might not
thank me after I'm done.

15:36.369 --> 15:39.003
The district won't give
you any money or resources

15:39.005 --> 15:40.238
and I have none to
allocate to you.

15:40.240 --> 15:42.473
No problem, Nolin and I
will handle fundraising.

15:42.475 --> 15:45.710
My buddy KJ is gonna give
us practice balls, pads.

15:45.712 --> 15:47.011
Also, administration...

15:47.013 --> 15:49.681
Insurance, liability
waivers, permission slips,

15:49.683 --> 15:50.982
grade point average minimums.

15:50.984 --> 15:52.417
Great, paperwork, bring it on.

15:52.419 --> 15:55.219
I love it.
Is that all?

15:55.322 --> 15:57.188
Mmm, I think I'm done.

15:57.190 --> 16:00.091
But I do want you to know
that I'm really sticking

16:00.093 --> 16:02.327
my neck out for you on this.

16:02.595 --> 16:04.595
Do not make me look bad.

16:05.465 --> 16:07.098
Now out.

16:07.400 --> 16:10.068
[Mark] Awesome. Thank you.

16:10.503 --> 16:12.337
Thank you.

16:12.339 --> 16:16.274
-I'll take one.
-See you soon.

16:18.645 --> 16:20.578
Woo!

16:26.486 --> 16:28.553
[Mark sighs]

16:28.555 --> 16:30.555
All that for this.

16:31.591 --> 16:34.225
It's OK, just relax.

16:37.597 --> 16:39.063
Kahlil.

16:39.065 --> 16:42.233
-What's up.
-All right, we got one.

16:42.235 --> 16:43.134
Oh, here we go.

16:43.136 --> 16:45.703
Hey, how's it going?

16:45.705 --> 16:47.238
How you doing?

16:47.240 --> 16:49.340
-Good to see you.
-Welcome.

16:49.342 --> 16:52.143
[Mark] Nice.
Jeez, we got a bunch here.

16:52.145 --> 16:52.643
Sweet.

16:52.645 --> 16:55.613
Great, well I'm glad
you guys could make it.

16:55.615 --> 16:57.515
So what, we got two
football teams now?

16:57.517 --> 17:00.051
What, no, this is for rugby.

17:00.053 --> 17:01.119
-Rugby?
-What?

17:01.121 --> 17:03.688
OK, yeah, I may have handed out
some fliers that said football.

17:03.690 --> 17:06.758
-They were confused
and I thought--
-He lied.

17:06.760 --> 17:10.395
Just you know get
'em to hear us out.

17:10.396 --> 17:11.128
Hmm.

17:11.131 --> 17:15.098
Well, if you're here
because you love football,

17:15.101 --> 17:15.800
I have great news.

17:15.801 --> 17:19.670
Rugby is the first
version of football.

17:19.672 --> 17:26.477
It's a game of passion,
excitement, action, and beauty.

17:26.746 --> 17:28.146
Beauty?

17:28.147 --> 17:30.548
-No, no, wait.
-Hey, guys.

17:30.550 --> 17:32.250
[Mac] OK.

17:33.119 --> 17:33.785
"Beauty?"

17:33.787 --> 17:37.055
I mean, like most great
things, the more you explain,

17:37.057 --> 17:37.789
the worse it sounds.

17:37.791 --> 17:41.292
-Let us just show you.
-OK.

17:42.462 --> 17:43.428
[audience cheers]

17:43.430 --> 17:46.631
You know, rugby is one of
the most popular sports
in the world.

17:46.633 --> 17:49.133
Much bigger than
baseball and football.

17:49.135 --> 17:52.303
[player shouting]

17:52.305 --> 17:55.139
This is called the Haka.

17:55.141 --> 17:57.708
It started as a war dance.

17:57.710 --> 17:59.777
It's a challenge
to their opponent.

17:59.779 --> 18:03.748
It's also a celebration
of life over death.

18:03.750 --> 18:07.552
[players chanting]

18:09.155 --> 18:11.756
This New Zealand team,
the All Blacks,

18:11.758 --> 18:13.825
they were the
underdogs of rugby.

18:13.827 --> 18:15.193
Now they dominate.

18:15.195 --> 18:18.429
Their connection to
the game is unmatched.

18:18.431 --> 18:20.364
There is another Haka
that's my favorite

18:20.366 --> 18:25.169
and it loosely translates to
"This is our land that rumbles.

18:25.171 --> 18:27.338
This is our time.

18:27.474 --> 18:28.539
This is our moment."

18:28.541 --> 18:31.476
[players grunt]

18:32.645 --> 18:33.811
What are they doing?

18:33.813 --> 18:35.413
This is called a scrum.

18:35.415 --> 18:37.148
Players from each
team bind together

18:37.150 --> 18:41.652
and push against each other
for possession of the ball.

18:42.856 --> 18:46.124
Nobody's puttin' their hands
up me like that [laughs].

18:46.126 --> 18:49.193
That is called a line-out,
and you would probably

18:49.195 --> 18:50.528
be doing most of the lifting.

18:50.530 --> 18:52.263
All right.

18:52.265 --> 18:53.197
Or maybe a hooker.

18:53.199 --> 18:54.298
-[class laughs]
-What?

18:54.300 --> 18:55.366
What'd you just call me?

18:55.368 --> 18:56.400
Take it easy, O'Brien,

18:56.402 --> 18:58.569
it's a position in rugby.

18:58.571 --> 19:02.807
[Mac] You get to slam
into people without pads.

19:04.511 --> 19:05.476
This jawn for real?

19:05.478 --> 19:09.380
Yeah, this jawn's
for real, O'Brien.

19:09.382 --> 19:12.550
So, kindly sit your
jawn back down.

19:16.723 --> 19:18.389
Thank you.

19:18.925 --> 19:20.825
[laughs]

19:22.228 --> 19:23.427
[boy] I don't know this.

19:23.429 --> 19:24.896
[group chattering]

19:24.898 --> 19:26.864
All right, this
is a team sort of.

19:26.866 --> 19:31.435
No, Kahlil?
I thought for sure he'd show up.

19:31.571 --> 19:32.570
We could play sevens.

19:32.572 --> 19:36.874
Yes, definitely,
sevens, without a sub.

19:36.876 --> 19:39.810
-But it's a good start.
-It's great.

19:39.812 --> 19:43.648
Did you all bring
your workout clothes?

19:45.351 --> 19:46.484
You're gonna practice in jeans?

19:46.486 --> 19:48.753
I run from 5-0
just fine in these,

19:48.755 --> 19:50.221
we don't need no short shorts.

19:50.223 --> 19:51.355
"Any." You don't need any.

19:51.357 --> 19:55.359
All right everybody, pile in
and let's go find our field.

19:55.361 --> 19:57.328
-8th and Poplar.
-All right.

19:57.330 --> 20:00.331
-I call shotgun.
-Shotgun.

20:03.436 --> 20:06.304
Man, this ain't no field,
this jawn's a prison yard.

20:06.306 --> 20:08.773
But it's ours, come on.

20:08.775 --> 20:13.544
I mean this...
it's not so bad, right?

20:17.317 --> 20:19.684
I mean, we can work with this.

20:19.686 --> 20:20.885
We're from Philly, right?

20:20.887 --> 20:24.322
Don't we need
goalposts or something?

20:24.724 --> 20:27.992
We can use... that.

20:29.662 --> 20:30.661
Come on.

20:30.663 --> 20:35.333
Everyone put these on and
pick up 10 pieces of trash.

20:35.335 --> 20:36.500
[Mark whistles]

20:36.502 --> 20:38.469
I mean 20 pieces of trash.

20:38.471 --> 20:42.373
Come on, guys, let's do
it, let's make this place

20:42.375 --> 20:43.841
an operating room.

20:43.843 --> 20:47.478
[easygoing music]

20:48.448 --> 20:50.481
Man, this is just nasty.

20:51.017 --> 20:52.516
Hey yo, if I get
caught with this,

20:52.518 --> 20:53.884
they gon' lock me
up again.

20:53.886 --> 20:55.353
Where you belong.

20:55.355 --> 20:56.287
Hey.

20:56.289 --> 20:58.756
Thank you, I'll take that.

20:58.758 --> 21:00.925
Look, everybody come in.

21:00.927 --> 21:03.027
Come on, take a knee.

21:03.363 --> 21:06.297
We have some basic team
rules before we can even
get on the field.

21:06.299 --> 21:10.368
First, I'm not your mother,
so don't expect me to treat
you that way.

21:10.370 --> 21:12.803
For that matter, Coach Nolin
is not your father.

21:12.805 --> 21:16.007
Coach Nolin's hella white.
[laughs]

21:16.009 --> 21:17.308
All right, listen up, fellas.

21:17.310 --> 21:20.878
You respect yourselves,
you respect each other,

21:20.880 --> 21:21.912
always do your best.

21:21.914 --> 21:26.417
Look around you, this is
your crew, this is your team.

21:26.419 --> 21:28.986
You could be somewhere else,
but you're here.

21:28.988 --> 21:31.289
So, let's pick up
the rest of this trash

21:31.291 --> 21:34.725
and let's play some
rugby, let's go.

21:34.727 --> 21:35.426
Yeah!

21:35.428 --> 21:38.562
We're gonna start with
a nice, easy pop pass.

21:38.564 --> 21:39.897
Call for the ball: ball!

21:39.899 --> 21:43.301
Secure the pass, turn around,
look for your man.

21:43.303 --> 21:45.536
-Ball.
-Talk to each other.

21:45.538 --> 21:48.439
Remember, in order to
move the ball forward,

21:48.441 --> 21:49.774
you have to pass it backwards.

21:49.776 --> 21:51.575
[Mark] There we go, that's it.

21:51.577 --> 21:52.576
Line up, let's go.

21:52.578 --> 21:55.546
[Mark] Let me show you guys how
to tackle in rugby, all right?

21:55.548 --> 21:57.848
[Mac] Step up, O'Brien.

21:58.017 --> 21:59.617
I want you to tackle
me at my hips.

21:59.619 --> 22:03.321
Wrap me up and drive
through, let's go.

22:04.324 --> 22:05.623
What, what are you doing?

22:05.625 --> 22:06.957
What is that, what's going on?

22:06.959 --> 22:08.993
Yeah, I don't tackle no girls.

22:08.995 --> 22:11.062
-Ooh.
-[players laugh]

22:11.064 --> 22:13.898
[Mac] All right,
then let's switch it up.

22:13.900 --> 22:17.101
Who here thinks they
can get past me?

22:17.437 --> 22:18.602
I got this.

22:18.604 --> 22:20.805
[players] Woo!

22:21.074 --> 22:22.640
It's about to go down.

22:22.642 --> 22:26.344
This ain't the hallway
no more, Coach.

22:26.346 --> 22:28.079
Whenever you're ready, Baby J.

22:28.081 --> 22:31.782
-[players cheer]
-[players clap]

22:31.784 --> 22:35.820
-Ready.
-[whistle blows]

22:35.822 --> 22:36.721
[Jaymie grunts]

22:36.723 --> 22:38.789
-Damn!
-[players shout]

22:38.791 --> 22:41.559
You just knocked down,
young boy!

22:41.561 --> 22:44.829
Don't mess with
Coach Mac! [laughs]

22:44.831 --> 22:45.730
You good?

22:45.732 --> 22:47.064
[Mark] All right,
guys, bring it in,

22:47.066 --> 22:48.933
bring it in, come on.
Bring it in.

22:48.935 --> 22:54.972
All right, not bad being our
first practice <i> and</i> clean up gig.

22:54.974 --> 22:58.909
We'll be pushing you
much harder tomorrow.

22:59.045 --> 23:01.979
Jaymie, break it down for us.

23:02.448 --> 23:04.014
Whitman on three.

23:04.016 --> 23:06.550
-One, two, three.
-Whitman.

23:06.552 --> 23:09.587
[Mark] All right, guys,
don't go home empty-handed,

23:09.589 --> 23:11.455
pick up those pads.

23:15.595 --> 23:17.595
[Ice] Mm-hmm.

23:18.431 --> 23:19.897
The Sioux Nation were nomads

23:19.899 --> 23:21.966
or without any fixed home base.

23:21.968 --> 23:26.103
To them, the land was sacred,
they had no concept

23:26.105 --> 23:27.037
of private property.

23:27.039 --> 23:29.907
-[bell rings]
-[students chatter]

23:29.909 --> 23:32.076
I will see you all tomorrow.

23:32.078 --> 23:35.946
[students chatter]

23:38.718 --> 23:40.718
Kahlil, can you hand back a sec?

23:40.720 --> 23:42.486
Close the door.

23:46.058 --> 23:47.925
Have a seat.

23:49.562 --> 23:50.461
So what's up?

23:50.463 --> 23:53.631
I graded your test
from yesterday.

23:54.066 --> 23:55.599
That's your second D.

23:55.601 --> 23:58.669
I swear I study like crazy.

23:58.671 --> 24:00.504
I believe you.

24:00.506 --> 24:03.774
How's it going in
your other classes?

24:05.011 --> 24:09.847
It's OK to ask
for help, got it?

24:10.183 --> 24:11.782
Yeah.

24:12.652 --> 24:17.054
I was surprised that
you didn't show up for rugby.

24:17.056 --> 24:21.225
You seemed more
interested than anyone.

24:21.227 --> 24:26.464
I know, but I made
varsity, well sort of.

24:27.166 --> 24:29.200
It's a big team this year, huh?

24:29.202 --> 24:31.068
How many are on the roster?

24:31.070 --> 24:32.736
-85.
-Wow.

24:32.738 --> 24:34.171
Is it hard to get playing time?

24:34.173 --> 24:36.240
Honestly, each of us is
just fighting for a chance

24:36.242 --> 24:38.075
to wear a uniform each week.

24:38.077 --> 24:41.145
Well, if you change your mind,

24:41.147 --> 24:44.148
I can guarantee you
plenty of playing time.

24:44.150 --> 24:46.250
Just think about it.

24:46.252 --> 24:49.553
I'll write you a pass.

24:52.024 --> 24:54.091
-Here.
-Thanks.

24:54.727 --> 24:56.594
Have a good day.

25:07.874 --> 25:09.206
-On coach's whistle.
-[whistle blows]

25:09.208 --> 25:11.609
Hop into your defensive stance,
elbows at your side,

25:11.611 --> 25:13.978
-eyes forward...
-[grunts]

25:13.980 --> 25:14.912
...run back to the cone,

25:14.914 --> 25:16.914
do it again, let's hit
the ground, let's go.

25:16.916 --> 25:19.783
-First one up.
-Come on.

25:19.785 --> 25:22.253
-What are you doing?
-Come on, O'Brien.

25:22.255 --> 25:24.622
O'Brien, go.
Right now, go.

25:24.624 --> 25:28.225
You wanted to hit people,
here's your chance.

25:29.295 --> 25:30.661
[whistle blows]

25:30.663 --> 25:31.662
Up, forward.

25:31.664 --> 25:33.964
[groans] There we go,
a little high, a little high.

25:33.966 --> 25:35.833
-Go lower.
-Next.

25:35.835 --> 25:37.968
[whistle blows]

25:37.970 --> 25:39.069
-Eyes forward.
-Yeah.

25:39.071 --> 25:44.275
-All right, see what you hit,
guys, see what you hit.
-That was good. A little lower.

25:45.745 --> 25:46.577
[groans] Nice.

25:46.579 --> 25:48.312
Lead with your shoulder,
lead with your shoulder.

25:48.314 --> 25:50.314
-All right, Sergio.
-[whistle blows]

25:50.316 --> 25:53.050
-I think I'm done, Coach.
-You're not done, go back.

25:53.052 --> 25:54.685
-Start again.
-Nice and low, nice and low.

25:54.687 --> 25:56.053
-That was great.
-You're never done.

25:56.055 --> 25:59.757
-You're never done.
-[whistle blows]

25:59.759 --> 26:01.191
-[groans] Yeah, nice.
-Yep, lower, lower.

26:01.193 --> 26:04.161
Ride through your hips, tackle
two feet behind me, all right?

26:04.163 --> 26:06.997
You can always do
better, let's go.

26:06.999 --> 26:10.801
O'Brien, get up,
right now, get up!

26:12.238 --> 26:15.105
[Mark] You got this. Come on.

26:15.107 --> 26:16.707
Nice!

26:17.209 --> 26:18.342
Banner, step up to O'Brien.

26:18.344 --> 26:21.679
O'Brien, wrap him up,
take him to the ground.

26:21.681 --> 26:25.816
OK, Banner, present the ball,
keep a skinny gate.
All right, great.

26:25.818 --> 26:27.151
[Mark] All right,
Jaymie, clear him out.

26:27.153 --> 26:28.185
-Go Jaymie.
-Come on.

26:28.187 --> 26:30.955
Stay low, grab a leg,
drive through the hips,

26:30.957 --> 26:32.222
there you go, nice.

26:32.224 --> 26:33.691
[Mac] John Nathan take the ball.

26:33.693 --> 26:34.291
Here we go.

26:34.293 --> 26:36.160
Brian and John, spread out,
support him, let's go.

26:36.162 --> 26:38.762
Play the ball on my
whistle, all right?

26:38.764 --> 26:42.366
[whistle blows]

26:42.802 --> 26:43.334
Nice!

26:43.336 --> 26:44.702
And that is your first ruck.

26:44.704 --> 26:47.738
Nice and tight, come on,
get in there, get in there.

26:47.740 --> 26:49.273
Grab his shorts.
Nice.

26:49.275 --> 26:52.142
-Nice. Tight.
-Crouch.

26:52.278 --> 26:54.144
O'Brien, when I
roll the ball in,

26:54.146 --> 26:56.347
you decided where it goes.

26:58.084 --> 27:00.217
[Jaymie] Come on, man,
what are you doing?

27:00.219 --> 27:01.619
-Hey.
-Hey.

27:01.621 --> 27:03.387
Hey, take a deep breath.

27:03.389 --> 27:08.025
Listen closely.
The secret to training in life:

27:08.027 --> 27:13.964
Difficulties, setbacks,
always moving forward.

27:14.400 --> 27:15.366
You hear me?

27:15.368 --> 27:17.101
Now, let's do this, go.

27:17.103 --> 27:18.302
[Mark] All right.

27:18.304 --> 27:20.137
Round up again, nice and tight.

27:20.139 --> 27:22.640
You got it, grab his shorts.

27:22.642 --> 27:24.274
Crouch.

27:26.112 --> 27:27.778
Nice!

27:27.780 --> 27:29.980
-There we go.
-[whistle blows]

27:29.982 --> 27:33.884
So, after a try, you get
a shot at conversion kick.

27:33.886 --> 27:35.853
It's two points.

27:37.857 --> 27:40.290
Something like that.

27:40.292 --> 27:42.192
-Ooh!
-Nice.

27:42.194 --> 27:43.127
Beautiful.

27:43.129 --> 27:44.728
A'ight, watch this.

27:44.730 --> 27:50.267
That's a drop kick, ball hits
the ground, you got it.

28:05.951 --> 28:07.418
[car alarm blares]

28:07.420 --> 28:09.987
Hey, guys.

28:10.256 --> 28:11.422
Hey, hey, it's OK.

28:11.424 --> 28:12.956
Nice distance.

28:12.958 --> 28:14.758
Come back, come...

28:15.161 --> 28:16.994
Hey, you, oh, oh, oh.

28:16.996 --> 28:18.796
-Sorry.
-[car alarm clicks]

28:18.798 --> 28:23.000
Yes, lunch time study
sessions are mandatory.

28:23.002 --> 28:25.169
Don't study, don't play.

28:27.073 --> 28:27.771
Yes?

28:27.773 --> 28:29.440
What if we get decent grades?

28:29.442 --> 28:30.808
Why we gotta be here?

28:30.810 --> 28:33.043
Man, your grades are whack.

28:33.045 --> 28:34.978
Man, shut up,
ain't nobody ask you.

28:34.980 --> 28:37.347
Because this team
is not just about rugby.

28:37.349 --> 28:40.017
It's about holding
each other accountable

28:40.019 --> 28:41.318
on and off the field.

28:41.320 --> 28:44.488
You work hard together,
you succeed together.

28:44.490 --> 28:47.357
And if Banner doesn't
pass Algebra II,

28:47.359 --> 28:50.861
then he can't play
and if he can't play,

28:50.863 --> 28:52.196
we don't even have seven.

28:52.198 --> 28:54.431
Which means no team.

28:54.433 --> 28:57.067
Hey, start gettin' to
class or I'm gonna track

28:57.069 --> 29:00.204
your Haitian ass
down and make you.

29:00.906 --> 29:02.473
Got it?

29:02.475 --> 29:03.841
And since you're all seniors,

29:03.843 --> 29:09.046
next week, we'll start
talking college applications.

29:09.048 --> 29:12.483
[students laugh]

29:13.052 --> 29:14.818
She drawlin'.

29:14.820 --> 29:17.221
Damn sure ain't
goin' to no college.

29:18.491 --> 29:20.257
Again.
OK, let's go.

29:20.259 --> 29:23.494
-John Nathan play the ball.
-[whistle blows]

29:25.431 --> 29:26.096
Ho, ooh!

29:26.098 --> 29:27.931
Watch those hospital passes,
come on, keep it low.

29:27.933 --> 29:31.101
Jaymie, don't drift,
stay straight, make
the defender commit.

29:31.103 --> 29:34.304
And if he doesn't, you just
go straight up the field.

29:34.306 --> 29:35.773
-All right.
-[Mark] Right?

29:35.775 --> 29:37.274
-Let's go, again.
-Let's try again.

29:37.276 --> 29:39.309
[Banner] You got this, bro.

29:40.146 --> 29:41.345
[whistle blows]

29:41.347 --> 29:44.348
[Mark laughs]

29:44.350 --> 29:46.416
-He got you.
-He did, he did.

29:46.418 --> 29:48.085
He got you! [laughs]

29:48.087 --> 29:49.787
Oh, that was nice.

29:49.789 --> 29:51.255
We'll give you that one time.

29:51.257 --> 29:53.090
-Good job.
-Right, reset.

29:53.092 --> 29:54.224
That's enough celebrating.

29:54.226 --> 29:56.527
-Get back on it.
-That was good.

29:56.529 --> 29:57.928
[whistle blows]

29:57.930 --> 29:58.562
[bell rings]

29:58.564 --> 30:02.432
Hey, Kahlil, hang back a sec.

30:09.909 --> 30:11.542
Sit with me.

30:17.883 --> 30:19.550
Damn!

30:20.152 --> 30:21.351
Damn is right.

30:21.353 --> 30:23.854
Kahlil, I have a short
test I'd like you to take.

30:23.856 --> 30:25.055
Another?
I'll just fail that too.

30:25.057 --> 30:26.223
It's not that kind of test.

30:26.225 --> 30:30.894
I asked a school aide about it,
it's just an assessment.

30:30.896 --> 30:32.930
If we know what
your challenge is,

30:32.932 --> 30:36.433
we can deal with it...
together.

30:37.436 --> 30:39.203
And I'll even let
you take it now,

30:39.205 --> 30:42.005
so you can skip
your next class.

30:43.909 --> 30:45.475
All right?

30:47.046 --> 30:49.079
Cool.

30:54.954 --> 30:57.020
[Kahlil sighs]

31:15.875 --> 31:19.042
Let me ask you something,
between us.

31:19.044 --> 31:21.945
Let me know if any
of these ring true.

31:21.947 --> 31:27.117
Do you sometimes confuse
small words like at or to?

31:27.119 --> 31:30.520
And, is it hard
to read out loud?

31:31.123 --> 31:33.490
After you read something,
would it be hard

31:33.492 --> 31:38.228
to explain what just
happened in the story?

31:38.931 --> 31:41.565
Do any of these sound familiar?

31:44.236 --> 31:45.569
OK.

31:45.571 --> 31:49.573
So, we'll need a full
assessment with an aide.

31:50.142 --> 31:52.976
But I think you
might have dyslexia.

31:52.978 --> 31:54.044
What?

31:54.046 --> 31:55.412
So, you're saying I'm stupid.

31:55.414 --> 31:58.582
Stupid?
Not at all.

31:58.918 --> 32:02.052
I mean would you call
Muhammad Ali, Steve Jobs

32:02.054 --> 32:04.988
or Magic Johnson stupid?

32:04.990 --> 32:07.190
I've got more.

32:13.332 --> 32:19.069
Why don't you come to our
lunch time study sessions
we have with the team.

32:19.071 --> 32:22.439
That could give you some
strategies to help you.

32:22.441 --> 32:26.343
And I'll set up a meeting with
the aide and your parents.

32:26.345 --> 32:28.178
I'll go with you.

32:28.414 --> 32:31.481
-OK?
-[Kahlil sighs]

32:31.483 --> 32:34.985
Hey.
Look at me.

32:36.121 --> 32:38.088
There is zero shame in this.

32:38.090 --> 32:42.159
Everyone has something
they have to deal with.

32:42.461 --> 32:45.562
Now, you have the information.

32:46.398 --> 32:48.398
That gives you power.

32:50.269 --> 32:52.169
A'ight?

32:54.206 --> 32:56.206
A'ight.

32:56.475 --> 32:58.575
Now get out of here.

33:11.423 --> 33:13.390
Thanks for having my back.

33:13.392 --> 33:15.592
That's my job, isn't it?

33:23.602 --> 33:24.735
[whistle blows]

33:24.737 --> 33:26.536
[clapping]

33:28.073 --> 33:29.639
[Mac] Talk, talk!

33:36.115 --> 33:40.384
Run, run, run, run
as fast as you can.

33:40.386 --> 33:42.219
Run, run, run.

33:52.197 --> 33:53.797
If you watch the pros play,
they get cards put on them

33:53.799 --> 33:55.599
all the time 'cause
they don't give a shit.

33:55.601 --> 33:59.503
Language, Tuna, one more time
and you're going to Wade.

33:59.505 --> 34:01.238
Shit, sorry--

34:01.507 --> 34:03.306
I mean sorry!

34:03.308 --> 34:06.076
Guess you make me feel
comfortable, Coach.

34:06.078 --> 34:09.212
So, sort of your fault.

34:09.214 --> 34:10.714
Oh, is that so?

34:10.716 --> 34:14.150
So, using your math,
I will make the whole team

34:14.152 --> 34:17.320
do five extra laps
at practice later,

34:17.322 --> 34:20.190
-so that's sort of your fault.
-[team groans]

34:20.192 --> 34:23.659
Come on, Tuna, shut up, man,
why you always talkin'?

34:24.429 --> 34:26.463
[door creaks]

34:29.101 --> 34:30.634
Come on in.

34:31.203 --> 34:32.302
Does everybody know Kahlil?

34:32.304 --> 34:37.340
He'll be joining us
for study sessions.

34:38.177 --> 34:39.842
<i> Ça passait.</i>

34:45.751 --> 34:47.417
All right.

34:47.485 --> 34:48.752
-Yo, Jaymie.
-Yeah, what's up?

34:48.754 --> 34:51.621
Between me and you, what you
think about this rugby stuff?

34:51.623 --> 34:54.458
Ain't for no sweet bulls,
that's for sure.

34:54.460 --> 34:57.794
Homegirl straight dropped
me at the first practice.

34:57.796 --> 35:00.363
She for real, bro.

35:00.365 --> 35:01.231
All right, bet.

35:01.233 --> 35:03.800
-Catch you later, a'ight?
-No doubt.

35:03.802 --> 35:05.268
-[whistle blows]
-All right, bring it in.

35:05.270 --> 35:07.404
Looking good, guys,
looking really good.

35:07.406 --> 35:10.307
-[Mac] Take a knee.
-[Mark] Hydrate.

35:10.309 --> 35:14.778
So, thanks to O'Brien and his
love affair with profanity,

35:14.780 --> 35:16.847
you all owe me five laps.

35:16.849 --> 35:18.215
Damn, man.

35:18.217 --> 35:20.450
Come on, man, you always
talkin' your mouth.

35:20.452 --> 35:21.718
Oh, you don't like that?

35:21.720 --> 35:23.820
What about a little
challenge then?

35:23.822 --> 35:28.325
This whatchamacallit
is a speed parachute.

35:28.327 --> 35:31.828
You strap it on, and you run
like someone stole your wallet.

35:31.830 --> 35:33.230
We'll do double or nothing.

35:33.232 --> 35:38.368
If one of you can run from
those pads past this tire

35:38.370 --> 35:41.371
in 10 seconds, zero laps.

35:41.373 --> 35:44.508
If you can't, 10 laps.

35:44.643 --> 35:46.510
Any takers?

35:47.146 --> 35:48.778
-Ooh.
-[players laugh]

35:48.780 --> 35:52.382
-Yeah.
-You funny, Tuna.

35:52.384 --> 35:53.316
Give me that thing.

35:53.318 --> 35:56.453
-[group claps]
-Yes!

35:56.455 --> 35:59.356
[Mark]
He thinks he's fast.

36:05.464 --> 36:07.697
OK, coach, on your whistle.

36:11.336 --> 36:13.670
-Let's go!
-[players clap]

36:13.672 --> 36:14.538

36:14.540 --> 36:16.339

36:47.272 --> 36:47.771
Good.

36:47.773 --> 36:49.906
[laughs] That was amazing.

36:49.908 --> 36:52.909
Everybody, take a knee,
we have an announcement.

36:52.911 --> 36:54.878
Drum roll, please, Coach Nolin.

36:54.880 --> 36:56.546
[drum rolling]

36:56.548 --> 36:57.614
We have our first scrimmage

36:57.616 --> 37:00.984
against St. Vincent's Prep
next week.

37:00.986 --> 37:01.718
Ooh.

37:01.720 --> 37:03.687
They have a good program,
big roster.

37:03.689 --> 37:06.756
They work really well
together as a team.

37:06.758 --> 37:08.391
I wanna show 'em what we got.

37:08.393 --> 37:09.659
Since we don't have no uniforms,

37:09.661 --> 37:11.394
can you guys just wear
all black t-shirts.

37:11.396 --> 37:14.497
Like the New Zealand team,
their warm up is nuts.

37:14.499 --> 37:17.234
-OK bring it in.
-It's called a Haka.

37:17.236 --> 37:18.401
Whitman on three.

37:18.403 --> 37:20.437
-One, two, three.
-Whitman!

37:20.439 --> 37:21.771
Let's kick some rich butts.

37:21.773 --> 37:22.939
[Mac] Let's just do our best.

37:22.941 --> 37:27.377
Guys, we need some help here,
we got some equipment
to pick up.

37:27.379 --> 37:29.012
What? What?

37:29.481 --> 37:35.252
[Mac] O'Brien, Nathan and
Jaymie, all right, let's go.

37:36.822 --> 37:38.622
Too late to join?

37:40.259 --> 37:41.258
What about football?

37:41.260 --> 37:43.526
They got 84 other players,
they'll be all right.

37:43.528 --> 37:46.963
I bet you can learn the
rules pretty quickly, huh?

37:46.965 --> 37:49.933
Already been watching up, Coach.

37:51.670 --> 37:53.737
OK, let's go.

37:55.040 --> 37:57.707
Looks like I found our sub.

37:59.578 --> 38:01.911
-Excellent.
-[players chatter]

38:01.913 --> 38:02.879
Kahlil, all right.

38:02.881 --> 38:04.981
Looks like O'Brien
lost his starting spot.

38:04.983 --> 38:07.550
-[players laugh]
-You're so funny.

38:07.552 --> 38:11.321
All right, we're ready to go.

38:11.323 --> 38:13.356
[Tuna] Nice.

38:13.358 --> 38:16.626
[upbeat music]

38:28.607 --> 38:34.711

<i> That feeling left with me ¶</i>

38:46.525 --> 38:49.326
<i> ¶ Ooh ¶</i>

38:49.328 --> 38:53.396
[Mac] All right, y'all let's go.

38:54.700 --> 38:57.367
Coach, how much do
you think it costs

38:57.369 --> 38:58.835
to go to this college?

38:58.837 --> 39:01.371
Tuna, this is a high school.

39:01.373 --> 39:02.906
-No shit.
-Hey, language.

39:02.908 --> 39:07.444
The field's right there, but
we have to head inside first.

39:07.446 --> 39:09.879
Wow, this is nice.

39:09.881 --> 39:12.916
Hey, Coach, that's for us?

39:12.918 --> 39:13.850
Sure looks like it.

39:13.852 --> 39:16.686
Don't have to tell me twice.

39:16.688 --> 39:19.389
Hey, O'Brien...
Guys, hey.

39:19.391 --> 39:22.759
Come on, don't eat too much,
you won't be able to play.

39:22.761 --> 39:24.361
Man, I knew it,
this joint a trap.

39:24.363 --> 39:26.563
Who cares, they have
name brand bread.

39:26.565 --> 39:28.898
-Ah.
-Let's get out to the field.

39:28.900 --> 39:30.033
[Mark] Come on, come on, guys.

39:30.035 --> 39:31.735
[Mac] Come on, we
got a game to play.

39:31.737 --> 39:32.802
It is a pretty nice spread.

39:32.804 --> 39:34.504
These chocolate chip
look pretty good.

39:34.506 --> 39:36.873
[Mac] Let's go.

39:36.875 --> 39:40.076
O'Brien, come on, come on.

39:40.078 --> 39:44.781
Jeez, you opening a bakery
or something like that?

39:46.051 --> 39:49.452
[tense music]

39:50.622 --> 39:52.389
Whoa.

40:19.851 --> 40:23.086
[players chant]

40:29.194 --> 40:30.427
Huddle up, guys.

40:30.429 --> 40:31.127
They're huge.

40:31.129 --> 40:33.997
Leave it all out on
the field today, OK?

40:33.999 --> 40:36.966
Win or lose, they will
not out-work us, yes?

40:36.968 --> 40:39.569
-[players] Yeah.
-I wanna hear you say it, yes.

40:39.571 --> 40:40.770
[players] Yes.

40:40.772 --> 40:42.806
All right, Whitman on three.

40:42.808 --> 40:44.674
-One, two, three.
-Whitman!

40:44.676 --> 40:48.144
-Let's go.
-[Mark claps]

40:48.146 --> 40:51.681
[Mark] Get out there,
come on, O'Brien.

40:53.151 --> 40:55.218
[whistle blows]

40:55.220 --> 40:56.853
Fire up.

40:57.456 --> 41:01.791
-Attack the ball, let's go!
-Nice kick.

41:03.495 --> 41:05.795
-Great hit.
-Spread out!

41:05.797 --> 41:08.198
[player] Move out!

41:11.636 --> 41:13.503
[Mark] OK.

41:13.772 --> 41:15.505
[Mac] Go Banner, go Banner.

41:15.507 --> 41:18.107
-Come on, Banner!
-Come on.

41:18.109 --> 41:19.108
OK, we're learning.

41:19.110 --> 41:22.946
We're always learning,
always learning, right?

41:22.948 --> 41:24.714
We gotta work on
staying flat on D.

41:24.716 --> 41:28.785
-You think so?
-[Mark laughs]

41:28.787 --> 41:32.222
[whistle blows]

41:32.624 --> 41:34.757
Come on, boys, let's go.

41:34.759 --> 41:36.726
Line up for the kick off, yeah!

41:36.728 --> 41:38.661
We gotta go again.

41:38.663 --> 41:40.163
Talk, all right.

41:40.165 --> 41:42.799
[players shouting]

41:42.801 --> 41:44.767
Yes, yes, yes, go left, go left.
No, go left.

41:44.769 --> 41:50.673
-No, no, no, Banner,
what are you doing?
-Got a whole to pass it to.

41:50.675 --> 41:54.010
[whistle blows]

41:54.679 --> 41:58.781
-You can't outrun seven people.
-The hell was he doing?

41:58.783 --> 41:59.516
Line out.

41:59.518 --> 42:00.717
-Line out.

Pick him up.

-spread out, guys!
-The game's still going, go!

42:09.528 --> 42:11.728
Go, go, go, go!

42:16.167 --> 42:17.800
[Mac] Patch up.

42:17.802 --> 42:20.003
-Throw your man.
-Come on, guys.

42:20.005 --> 42:23.139
-Run!
-Oh!

42:24.809 --> 42:26.543

You watching this, Kahlil?

42:30.215 --> 42:31.314
Cramp.

[Mark] Hey.

42:33.018 --> 42:33.750
You OK?

42:33.752 --> 42:34.918
-What's wrong?
-Cramp.

42:34.920 --> 42:38.788
Jesus, man, I told you to take
it easy with those hoagies.

42:38.790 --> 42:39.923
All right, you'll be all right.

42:39.925 --> 42:41.057
OK, Kahlil, you're in.

42:41.059 --> 42:43.660
Stay present, anticipate
their run pattern,

42:43.662 --> 42:45.128
-always tackle low.
-[whistle blows]

42:45.130 --> 42:45.995
One second.

42:45.997 --> 42:48.798
By the waist, OK? Go!

42:51.036 --> 42:52.569
You can't eat and play rugby.

42:52.571 --> 42:56.573
OK? You can't do
both at the same time.

42:56.575 --> 42:58.308
Let's go.

42:58.310 --> 43:00.209
Catch up.

43:00.679 --> 43:01.778
[player] Come on, take a play.

43:01.780 --> 43:05.982
-Call it out, call it out.
-On your back.

43:05.984 --> 43:09.686
Oh, did you see that?

43:09.688 --> 43:12.889
Pick up the ball,
pick up the ball!

43:12.891 --> 43:14.123
Run, run, run!

43:14.125 --> 43:17.660

43:58.670 --> 43:59.702
That was beautiful.

43:59.704 --> 44:02.305
Spread out, heads up.

[whistle blows]

44:05.310 --> 44:06.709
[clapping]

44:06.711 --> 44:08.378
Match up.

44:12.217 --> 44:13.783
[whistle blows]

44:13.785 --> 44:15.151
What, that's bullshit, man.

44:15.153 --> 44:15.952
Chill, man.

44:15.954 --> 44:17.920
Man, shut up, ain't
nobody asked you.

44:17.922 --> 44:20.023
[Mac] Jaymie.

44:22.327 --> 44:24.994
[whistle blows]

44:24.996 --> 44:27.730
-OK, guys, bring it in.
-Come on.

44:27.732 --> 44:29.732
-All right guys.
-Man, what are you doing?

44:29.734 --> 44:30.667
Hydrate, hydrate.

44:30.669 --> 44:31.734
I eat when I'm stressed.

44:31.736 --> 44:33.970
Why don't you try it,
might calm you down a bit.

44:33.972 --> 44:36.105
Leave him alone,
Tuna's not the one

44:36.107 --> 44:37.173
giving away penalty points.

44:37.175 --> 44:38.775
I don't see you
scoring to keep up.

44:38.777 --> 44:40.176
-Ain't that your job, Haiti?
-Stop!

44:40.178 --> 44:41.844
If someone would give me
the ball on the outside.

44:41.846 --> 44:43.246
-Chill out, man.
-And what are you talking about?

44:43.248 --> 44:45.214
-You're not even on this team.
-[Kahlil] Hey, yo, what's up.

44:45.216 --> 44:47.717
Yo! Remember me,
your coach?

44:47.719 --> 44:49.085
We need to pull this together.

44:49.087 --> 44:51.954
Look, you are playing
the best of the best here.

44:51.956 --> 44:54.757
This team ranked second
in the state last year.

44:54.759 --> 44:55.925
This is your first scrimmage.

44:55.927 --> 44:58.961
This is a hard game,
that's why it's worth playing.

44:58.963 --> 45:01.330
Now get out there,
keep your heads up!

45:01.332 --> 45:03.866
Play your best!
Look out for each other,

45:03.868 --> 45:06.235
and show them what
North Philly is all about!

45:06.237 --> 45:08.404
-Now let's go!
-Let's go!

45:08.406 --> 45:11.074
-[Mac] Come on.
-[player] Come on!

45:12.911 --> 45:15.945
Tuna, put that sandwich down.

45:17.082 --> 45:19.749
-Tuna!
-[whistle blows]

45:19.751 --> 45:21.084
Line up for the return.

45:21.086 --> 45:22.919
Don't bunch up, come on now.

45:22.921 --> 45:27.824
-Woo!
-[whistle blows]

45:27.826 --> 45:29.992
Watch the quick restart.

45:34.299 --> 45:36.766
[whistle blows]

45:36.768 --> 45:39.168
[player groans]

45:39.170 --> 45:41.337
What you lookin' at,
he's fine, he's fine.

45:41.339 --> 45:43.106
I think we should pull Jaymie.

45:43.108 --> 45:44.440
O'Brien, go in for Jaymie.

45:44.442 --> 45:47.110
[Jaymie] What, he's fine,
he's fine, come on, he's good.

45:47.112 --> 45:49.011
-[Banner]
You can't hit him like that.
-Yes, I can.

45:49.013 --> 45:50.880
You high tackle like that,
you could kill somebody.

45:50.882 --> 45:52.415
It's stupid.

45:52.417 --> 45:55.251
-What'd you call me?
-Chill, chill!

45:55.820 --> 45:56.419
Here we go.

45:56.421 --> 45:59.956
-[whistle blows]
-[players chatter]

45:59.958 --> 46:01.791
Hey, hey, hey!

46:01.793 --> 46:03.459
-Forfeit.
-No, come on, man.

46:03.461 --> 46:05.361
We forfeit.

46:06.097 --> 46:06.963
[whistle blows]

46:06.965 --> 46:11.033
Go, go to the bench now!
Turn around.

46:11.202 --> 46:12.368
Go!

46:12.370 --> 46:15.104
I hope you're proud
of yourselves.

46:15.106 --> 46:15.938
What was that?

46:15.940 --> 46:18.007
Listen, Coach, I'm really sorry
about what happened out there.

46:18.009 --> 46:20.042
Great game, thank you.

46:20.044 --> 46:20.943
Sorry about that.

46:20.945 --> 46:24.046
They'll be OK.
Look, you guys come back
when you're ready, eh.

46:24.048 --> 46:26.282
Thanks, coach.

46:32.524 --> 46:34.991
Take off your headphones.

46:34.993 --> 46:39.128
Take off your headphones, now!

46:42.300 --> 46:44.801
Well?
What was that?

46:44.803 --> 46:48.805
Man, them boys was trash.
Thought they was better than us.

46:48.807 --> 46:51.440
Yes, they were better than us.

46:51.442 --> 46:52.975
Man, forget that.
Forget all this!

46:52.977 --> 46:57.513
Jaymie, you're pissed
at yourself because
you know you messed up.

46:57.515 --> 47:03.519
The first person to raise
their fist to anyone will lose.

47:03.521 --> 47:04.987
Look at me.

47:04.989 --> 47:07.890
-You got me?
-I got you.

47:07.892 --> 47:11.994
We started this team
because we believed in you.

47:11.996 --> 47:15.898
You're bright,
capable young men.

47:15.900 --> 47:18.234
Now you need to act like it.

47:18.236 --> 47:20.870
More importantly, play like it.

47:22.106 --> 47:25.308
[Mac scoffs]
Let's go.

47:56.374 --> 47:59.542
Hey, Rocky, get in,
I'll give you a ride.

47:59.544 --> 48:00.943
It's far.

48:00.945 --> 48:03.079
Well, then you should
definitely get in.

48:03.081 --> 48:05.948
Come on, it's getting late.

48:25.236 --> 48:26.502
[easygoing music]

48:26.504 --> 48:32.041
Oh yeah, that's better,
old head music.

48:32.043 --> 48:34.277
What you know about
that, young buck?

48:34.279 --> 48:36.212
[both laugh]

48:36.214 --> 48:39.315
It's coming up in a few blocks.
You could drop me off here.

48:39.317 --> 48:43.419
No, no, door to door
service only.

48:46.157 --> 48:49.425
[hip hop music]

48:51.596 --> 48:52.695
Let me walk you to your door.

48:52.697 --> 48:54.497
Coach, don't get out of the car.

48:54.499 --> 48:57.466
I don't care where you're from.

49:01.539 --> 49:02.638
Is that you up there?

49:02.640 --> 49:06.175
Yeah, moms has
people over a lot.

49:06.177 --> 49:09.445
I'm sorry about earlier today,
I lost it.

49:09.447 --> 49:12.515
I just know
you're better than that.

49:12.517 --> 49:15.618
How you know?
You don't know me, Coach.

49:15.620 --> 49:18.587
I know you were
locked up for dealing,

49:18.589 --> 49:21.424
and that doesn't
define you, Jaymie.

49:21.426 --> 49:25.227
You have choices,
you always have choices.

49:25.229 --> 49:29.465
You're a strong player,
I see you playing in college.

49:30.034 --> 49:32.101
I mean I like rugby,
but for real,

49:32.103 --> 49:35.604
most of us ain't going
to college, especially me.

49:37.976 --> 49:40.176
Aren't.

49:41.079 --> 49:41.644
What?

49:41.646 --> 49:44.380
Aren't going to college.
you'll never get in

49:44.382 --> 49:46.983
if you keep saying ain't.

49:47.118 --> 49:50.419
Well, you aren't funny.

49:50.421 --> 49:52.321
Touché.

49:52.323 --> 49:56.058
Thanks for the ride, Coach,
I'll see you at school.

49:56.060 --> 50:00.162
[tense hip-hop music]

50:07.305 --> 50:10.473
Jaymie, Jaymie, Jaymie.

50:13.177 --> 50:16.112
Come on, let's bail.

50:18.216 --> 50:20.649
[gentle music]

50:20.651 --> 50:22.585
Maybe that kid Jaymie is right.

50:22.587 --> 50:24.687
The last thing you want
is to get them excited

50:24.689 --> 50:26.522
about a life they'll never have.

50:26.524 --> 50:27.590
Well, that's depressing.

50:27.592 --> 50:29.258
I should just prepare
them for jail?

50:29.260 --> 50:31.260
I know you identify
with these kids,

50:31.262 --> 50:33.662
but not everyone is
cut out for college.

50:33.664 --> 50:36.132
You've worked your ass off
to defy expectations,

50:36.134 --> 50:38.501
but face it,
you're a bit of an outlier.

50:38.503 --> 50:41.270
Yes, I've always felt
like an outsider.

50:41.272 --> 50:43.339
Adopted, white parents,
dad sick,

50:43.341 --> 50:45.074
mom drunk half the time,
which might be worse

50:45.076 --> 50:47.043
than drunk all the time,
'cause at least I'd know

50:47.045 --> 50:49.211
which mother is walking
through the door at night.

50:49.213 --> 50:53.482
I paid my own weight, Kate.
And rugby made a big difference.

50:53.484 --> 50:56.552
Yeah, for you, but look
what happened yesterday.

50:56.554 --> 50:58.554
Maybe encouraging them
to play a brute sport

50:58.556 --> 51:01.357
where they slam into each
other isn't the best for them.

51:01.359 --> 51:03.292
I mean don't they have enough
to deal with over there?

51:03.294 --> 51:04.660
First of all,
rugby is an outlet.

51:04.662 --> 51:07.363
Second of all, what do
you mean by "over there"?

51:07.365 --> 51:09.398
When was the last time
you set foot in North Philly?

51:09.400 --> 51:12.802
Fine. I'm just saying
you're not their social worker,

51:12.804 --> 51:14.503
and you're definitely
not their mother.

51:14.505 --> 51:16.672
I'm sorry, excuse me, what?

51:16.674 --> 51:18.407
OK, how many letters
from your mom

51:18.409 --> 51:20.509
are gonna show up here
before you respond to her?

51:20.511 --> 51:21.510
And you care, why?

51:21.512 --> 51:23.145
I care because
you're my best friend,

51:23.147 --> 51:24.814
and maybe if you'd at least
heard what she had to say

51:24.816 --> 51:28.384
you wouldn't be so damn guarded
and shut off all the time.

51:28.386 --> 51:30.419
Here, what is this, number 100?

51:30.421 --> 51:34.557
Number mind
your damn business. Bye.

51:34.559 --> 51:36.292
Maybe I should come
back when you've done

51:36.294 --> 51:39.628
a little more yoga and
you're less of a bitch.

51:45.470 --> 51:48.604
[Mac sighs]

51:50.675 --> 51:53.809
Your challenge is to figure
out how to get from this

51:53.811 --> 51:57.813
to a perfect circle
without letting go.

51:57.815 --> 51:59.748
This is going to be easy.

51:59.750 --> 52:00.616
[players groan]

52:00.618 --> 52:04.453
-Ah, my arm. Ah, my arm!
-Communicate! Teamwork!

52:04.455 --> 52:05.421
Spin!

52:05.423 --> 52:08.591
No, come on. Again.

52:08.593 --> 52:11.127
[door creaks]

52:11.129 --> 52:12.261
[student] Let's go, man.

52:12.263 --> 52:13.462
-No.
-What?

52:13.464 --> 52:15.197
No way are you coming
into this class with that,

52:15.199 --> 52:16.699
and I don't even wanna
know how you got it.

52:16.701 --> 52:19.468
-[student] Slow, slow.
-Have you ever been in the
cafeteria, the food sucks.

52:19.470 --> 52:21.403
-What are y'all doing?
-You put your hand--

52:21.405 --> 52:22.605
-No.
-In there.

52:22.607 --> 52:23.873
Are y'all holding hands?

52:23.875 --> 52:25.474
Get in there.

52:25.476 --> 52:27.743
We're never gonna get this.

52:27.745 --> 52:28.677
Failure is your teacher.

52:28.679 --> 52:31.881
If you're having trouble,
ask for help.

52:31.883 --> 52:32.882
Lean into your team.

52:32.884 --> 52:35.518
That's what great teams do,
they're family,

52:35.520 --> 52:39.755
they stick together.
Come on, let's go.

52:39.757 --> 52:41.624
Come on.

52:41.626 --> 52:43.259
Come on.

52:45.563 --> 52:47.196
-Tuna.
-My wrist, my wrist.

52:47.198 --> 52:49.265
-Too fast, man.
-Guys, guys.

52:49.267 --> 52:52.835
One voice, one voice,
go back, go back.

52:53.604 --> 52:55.437
All right.

52:55.439 --> 52:57.640
Next, you, Jonathon, go.

52:57.642 --> 52:58.474
Nice. Jaymie?

52:58.476 --> 53:02.778
Keep going, keep going,
one more, one more.

53:02.780 --> 53:05.381
-Yes, victory!
-OK, great!

53:05.383 --> 53:08.684
Practice is mandatory
after school.

53:08.686 --> 53:09.685
It's a field trip.

53:09.687 --> 53:12.288
Hey yo, we should
hold hands more often.

53:12.290 --> 53:14.290
Shut up, Tuna.

53:14.292 --> 53:17.660
[phone buzzes]

53:30.908 --> 53:33.475
[Mac] Let's go.

53:41.953 --> 53:43.786
What are we doing here, Coach?

53:43.788 --> 53:45.955
You'll see.

53:49.360 --> 53:52.995
[Mark] There's the man.
How you doing?

53:52.997 --> 53:53.963
Good to see you, man.

53:53.965 --> 53:55.397
This is awesome,
this is so great.

53:55.399 --> 53:58.734
-Happy to have you guys, man.
-I'm so psyched.

54:02.406 --> 54:03.639
-KJ.
-Mac.

54:03.641 --> 54:05.975
Guys, come here, come here.

54:06.377 --> 54:08.911
This is KJ, he's a
good friend of mine.

54:08.913 --> 54:11.880
Head coach of USA 7s.

54:11.882 --> 54:15.551
Heard a lot of good things
about you guys, welcome.

54:15.553 --> 54:18.954
Come on, I'll show
you guys around.

54:18.956 --> 54:22.491
This is the big time, big time.

54:24.295 --> 54:24.860
All right.

54:24.862 --> 54:26.528
Here we are, are y'all ready?

54:26.530 --> 54:28.931
Ready. This is cool.

54:31.802 --> 54:33.769
-Dang.
-Yo.

54:35.473 --> 54:38.807
-Do you see this?
-[players chattering]

54:38.809 --> 54:41.010
[whistle blows]

54:41.012 --> 54:42.945
Oh hell no, you want
us to run with them?

54:42.947 --> 54:46.482
[KJ] Relax, they're
here to help.

54:46.617 --> 54:50.019
Fellas, these are the guys
I was telling you about.

54:50.021 --> 54:51.353
-What's up, guys?
-Hi.

54:51.355 --> 54:54.723
We got some practice
gear in the back waiting
for you guys.

54:54.725 --> 54:56.325
Suit up.

54:56.327 --> 54:57.393
All right, let's do this.

54:57.395 --> 55:03.365
-[upbeat music]
-[whistle blows]

55:03.367 --> 55:04.767
-Hold it.
-All right, ready?

55:04.769 --> 55:08.037
-Yeah.
-Three, two, one.

55:17.982 --> 55:19.848
Stand back.

55:20.651 --> 55:23.052
[Mark groans]

55:23.054 --> 55:26.388
[Mark laughs]

55:28.526 --> 55:31.093
[Tuna] Take, two, one.

55:32.897 --> 55:35.931
[clapping]

55:42.373 --> 55:44.373
[cheering]

55:44.375 --> 55:45.708
All right, guys, your turn.

55:45.710 --> 55:46.942
I wanna see guys
run a special, OK?

55:46.944 --> 55:48.377
-All right, break.
-All right.

55:48.379 --> 55:51.547

You like it, I love it.

Go.

-You serious?
-[KJ] Go!

56:29.120 --> 56:31.620
<i> ¶ Can you feel the energy ¶</i>

56:31.622 --> 56:34.690
All right, everybody, meet
in the middle, hustle up.

56:34.692 --> 56:36.158
[whistle blows]

56:36.160 --> 56:40.062
Nice work out there,
and after only one month?

56:40.064 --> 56:40.896
[Mac] Mm-hmm.

56:40.898 --> 56:42.631
I think you guys got
something really special.

56:42.633 --> 56:46.101
You're not typical ruggers,
you know that, right?

56:46.103 --> 56:47.870
But neither was I at your age.

56:47.872 --> 56:50.406
Look, Coach Nolin and I
briefly started a rugby program

56:50.408 --> 56:53.675
at another high school
called The Nomads.

56:53.677 --> 56:55.978
We had to shut things down
because of budget cuts,

56:55.980 --> 56:59.815
but you guys got
some real momentum.

56:59.817 --> 57:02.117
Listen, I grew up
on these same streets.

57:02.119 --> 57:03.819
I know what this game
can do for you

57:03.821 --> 57:05.954
and the opportunities
it can bring.

57:05.956 --> 57:10.659
If you want something, and
you're willing to work for it,

57:10.661 --> 57:14.163
anything is possible, all right?

57:14.165 --> 57:16.465
All right, bring it in.

57:16.467 --> 57:17.733
7 as one.

57:17.735 --> 57:19.468
Team on three, team on three.

57:19.470 --> 57:21.770
-One, two, three.
-Team!

57:24.809 --> 57:27.776

[whistle blows]

57:53.170 --> 57:54.770
[whistle blows]

57:54.772 --> 57:58.607
Let's call it, guys, huddle up.

57:59.977 --> 58:01.777
Great work.

58:01.779 --> 58:06.215
We want you all to know,
we see you.

58:06.217 --> 58:09.251
We see you guys
putting in the effort.

58:09.253 --> 58:11.954
And Coach Nolin and
I think you're ready

58:11.956 --> 58:12.988
for your second scrimmage.

58:12.990 --> 58:16.558
We're playing Upper Darby,
they're a really good team.

58:16.560 --> 58:18.961
[Mac] The discipline you've been
showing us these past few weeks,

58:18.963 --> 58:22.831
we'll see that effort when
you're playing them, right?

58:22.833 --> 58:24.199
-She means especially me.
-[players laugh]

58:24.201 --> 58:27.202
-We got you, Coach.
-Yes, but it's more than that.

58:27.204 --> 58:31.807
You've worked hard,
you're bonding like brothers

58:31.809 --> 58:33.942
and now it's time
to put it into action.

58:33.944 --> 58:36.712
Coach, don't you think
we need a team name?

58:36.714 --> 58:39.615
All right, any ideas?

58:39.617 --> 58:41.216
Well, we've been
talking about it.

58:41.218 --> 58:45.220

'Sup, Ice, I've just

59:26.964 --> 59:28.297
After all we've been through,

59:28.299 --> 59:30.933
you don't even call
me when you get home?

59:30.935 --> 59:33.969
When I got out,
we had a big party,

59:33.971 --> 59:37.105
mad chicks, everything
and we supposed

59:37.107 --> 59:38.774

I'm full, man,
I've just been busy--

59:43.581 --> 59:46.882
Hold up, hold up,

those four stacks
you owe me though.

01:00:01.298 --> 01:00:02.798
-Four stacks?
-Yeah.

01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:03.966
That bust wasn't my fault.

01:00:03.968 --> 01:00:05.834
I did a year, I coulda been
out in two months,

01:00:05.836 --> 01:00:08.170
-but I kept my mouth shut.
-Course you did.

01:00:08.172 --> 01:00:12.207
That's why it ain't
four K plus interest.

01:00:12.977 --> 01:00:15.010
You know what happen
to people that play

01:00:15.012 --> 01:00:17.746

Look, I'll pay it off,
I'll get a part time job--

Working in the poppy store?

01:00:24.822 --> 01:00:27.923
You gonna do some
sweepin' and all that?

01:00:27.925 --> 01:00:30.258
That ain't gonna cut it.

01:00:30.260 --> 01:00:31.994
Look at me.

01:00:31.996 --> 01:00:37.899
You gonna pay me back
my bread, that's a fact.

01:00:42.039 --> 01:00:44.339
Hold that.

No day off?

01:02:43.761 --> 01:02:47.496
Nope, especially since
you need to be in top form

01:02:47.498 --> 01:02:50.398
for your upcoming tournament.

01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:51.099

Cleaning up a bit.

01:07:43.460 --> 01:07:45.260
to play a real contact sport,

01:07:45.262 --> 01:07:49.764
he's demonstrated leadership
and game smarts, Kahlil,

01:07:49.766 --> 01:07:50.732
come get this.

01:07:50.734 --> 01:07:52.200
-Yes.
-Kahlil.

01:07:52.202 --> 01:07:54.536
[cheering]

01:07:55.806 --> 01:07:58.339
To my tackling dummy.

01:07:58.341 --> 01:08:02.477
The player who has
shown real courage

01:08:02.479 --> 01:08:06.514
and a newly-found
restraint, Jaymie!

01:08:06.516 --> 01:08:08.583
-Yeah.
-[boys clap]

01:08:08.585 --> 01:08:11.319
Chill, chill, relax, relax.

01:08:11.321 --> 01:08:12.854
Thanks, Coach.

01:08:13.824 --> 01:08:19.094
To the player who was willing
to sell his body for the team--

01:08:19.095 --> 01:08:19.727
[boys laugh]

01:08:19.729 --> 01:08:22.630
And to the player
who keeps us laughing.

01:08:22.631 --> 01:08:23.765
Tuna, we're proud of you.

01:08:23.767 --> 01:08:26.501
-[boys cheer]
-[boys clap]

01:08:26.502 --> 01:08:29.571
-[Tuna grunts]
-[boys laugh]

01:08:29.573 --> 01:08:32.407
To the player who is most
spiritually connected--

01:08:32.408 --> 01:08:35.243
[Tuna] What do you got
in there, man, a rock?

01:08:35.245 --> 01:08:37.312
-John.
-[boys clap]

01:08:37.314 --> 01:08:39.346
[cheering]

01:08:39.349 --> 01:08:41.783
-The hell, man?
-Don't worry about it.

01:08:41.785 --> 01:08:42.750
I am worried about it.

01:08:42.752 --> 01:08:43.885
Do you wanna get
locked up again?

01:08:43.886 --> 01:08:48.756
-You wouldn't understand.
-Hey, you got your team now.

01:08:48.758 --> 01:08:49.890
You got me.

01:08:49.893 --> 01:08:51.359
-[boys clap]
-OK.

01:08:51.361 --> 01:08:55.729
And last, but not least,
to the player who can outrun

01:08:55.732 --> 01:08:57.832
school security
and his opponents

01:08:57.834 --> 01:09:00.835
with the greatest
sense of self, Banner.

01:09:00.837 --> 01:09:03.537
-[boys claps]
-Yes.

01:09:03.540 --> 01:09:06.508
[Banner speaks
in foreign language]

01:09:06.510 --> 01:09:07.742
Whatever that means.

01:09:07.743 --> 01:09:09.277
All right, everybody let's eat.

01:09:09.279 --> 01:09:11.345
-Hey, don't use these plates.
-Not with these plates.

01:09:11.348 --> 01:09:13.148
[Mark] Yeah, come on,
these are special.

01:09:13.149 --> 01:09:14.215
[player] These are awards.

01:09:14.216 --> 01:09:15.716
-Put that down.
-You can have two O'Brien.

01:09:15.719 --> 01:09:17.652
[Tuna] I never thought
I could one eat.

01:09:17.654 --> 01:09:19.154
[all laugh]

01:09:19.156 --> 01:09:22.557
[Mac] John Ethan, can you
take this to my car please?

01:09:22.559 --> 01:09:24.225
Thank you.

01:09:27.264 --> 01:09:29.898
-Jaymie.
-Yeah, Coach?

01:09:29.899 --> 01:09:31.633
I wanted to say something to you

01:09:31.635 --> 01:09:35.203
about how you handled things
after St. Vincent's.

01:09:36.173 --> 01:09:38.840
The way you let things go.

01:09:39.776 --> 01:09:42.544
I'm really proud of you.

01:09:42.546 --> 01:09:45.680
-Thanks, Coach.
-And...

01:09:47.450 --> 01:09:49.551
I want you to have this.

01:09:49.886 --> 01:09:52.187
My high school
coach gave it to me

01:09:52.189 --> 01:09:56.724
because of some things
I was dealing with back then.

01:09:57.260 --> 01:10:00.795
Believe it or not,
I used to lose my cool too.

01:10:01.831 --> 01:10:05.733
I used to sleep with it,
tucked in my arm for a year.

01:10:08.705 --> 01:10:09.404
You sure?

01:10:09.406 --> 01:10:13.474
Oh yeah, I know
it's in good hands.

01:10:13.476 --> 01:10:16.844
[mysterious music]

01:10:26.289 --> 01:10:29.657
[dramatic music]

01:10:32.896 --> 01:10:35.630
What's up, Jaymie?
See you, young bull.

01:10:35.632 --> 01:10:36.965
What's up, Deuce, Ice around?

01:10:36.967 --> 01:10:38.533
Nah, he left,
what's good though?

01:10:38.535 --> 01:10:40.501
I need you to give him
something for me.

01:10:40.503 --> 01:10:45.406
All right.

01:10:45.408 --> 01:10:46.407
What's all this?

01:10:46.409 --> 01:10:48.977
It's the four stacks
plus an extra 500,

01:10:48.979 --> 01:10:50.778
and all the product
there I left.

01:10:50.780 --> 01:10:54.916
Look, man, tell Ice,
my bad, but I'm out.

01:10:54.918 --> 01:10:55.984
I can't do it no more.

01:10:55.986 --> 01:10:58.486
All right, I'll let him
know what's going on.

01:10:58.488 --> 01:11:01.856
Don't worry, young bull,
I got your back.

01:11:01.858 --> 01:11:04.259
I appreciate you.

01:11:16.473 --> 01:11:17.872
Listen.

01:11:17.874 --> 01:11:20.608
I know you're still upset
'cause of what I said

01:11:20.610 --> 01:11:25.713
about your mom, who by the way,
sent yet another letter

01:11:25.715 --> 01:11:28.049
and also the insensitive
white privilege rugby thing

01:11:28.051 --> 01:11:28.983
and that's OK.

01:11:28.985 --> 01:11:31.786
If this is an apology,
it's your worst ever.

01:11:31.788 --> 01:11:32.654
Just hear me out.

01:11:32.656 --> 01:11:35.023
-I have news.
-What? You're pregnant.

01:11:35.025 --> 01:11:37.959
Hardly, someone else got
laid and she's pregnant.

01:11:37.961 --> 01:11:41.496
Specifically an English
teacher at Immaculate Heart

01:11:41.498 --> 01:11:43.531
who wants to take
a few years off.

01:11:43.533 --> 01:11:47.468
-OK.
-Mac, there is a job for you
at Immaculate Heart.

01:11:47.470 --> 01:11:50.438
Like 10 grand more than
what you're making now.

01:11:50.440 --> 01:11:51.973
I mean it's not 100% yet,
but it's close.

01:11:51.975 --> 01:11:54.475
I talked you up big time,
even while we were fighting,

01:11:54.477 --> 01:11:56.878
which I'm really
proud of myself for.

01:11:56.880 --> 01:11:58.980
Well, I already slipped
them your resume

01:11:58.982 --> 01:12:02.717
and they wanna meet you before
they start their search.

01:12:02.719 --> 01:12:04.452
You may say something.

01:12:04.454 --> 01:12:07.922
Perhaps, thank you, my darling?

01:12:08.758 --> 01:12:10.425
Wow.

01:12:11.328 --> 01:12:13.661
Thank you.

01:12:16.433 --> 01:12:19.100
[player] You get one,
let me get one.

01:12:19.102 --> 01:12:20.501
Where's Coach?

01:12:20.503 --> 01:12:23.604
-I don't know.
-Who cares.

01:12:23.606 --> 01:12:25.707
What's up with them?

01:12:25.875 --> 01:12:28.042
[ominous music]

01:12:28.044 --> 01:12:29.777
[sighs]
I'll be right back.

01:12:29.779 --> 01:12:30.912
[Tuna] Hold up, I'm coming with.

01:12:30.914 --> 01:12:34.349
-Nah, stay there.
-No, I'm coming with.

01:12:34.351 --> 01:12:36.984
All right, but don't say shit.

01:12:39.689 --> 01:12:40.988
Hey yo, who dat?

01:12:40.990 --> 01:12:43.358
Yo.

01:12:43.360 --> 01:12:44.959
Let him handle it.

01:12:47.564 --> 01:12:50.498
Jaymie, Jaymie, Jaymie.

01:12:50.500 --> 01:12:53.835
[tense hip-hop music]

01:12:55.872 --> 01:12:58.039
What's up, Ice, they tell you?

01:12:58.041 --> 01:12:59.040
Yeah, they told me.

01:12:59.042 --> 01:13:01.075
They told me you came
by the spot last night

01:13:01.077 --> 01:13:02.877
with half my product
and no paper.

01:13:02.879 --> 01:13:04.946
What, I gave him 4,500
and everything I had.

01:13:04.948 --> 01:13:06.714
-I told you he'd say that.
-Man, you lyin'.

01:13:06.716 --> 01:13:08.716
You callin' me a liar,
young bull, I'll murk you, man.

01:13:08.718 --> 01:13:13.888
-You won't even touch him too.
-Hey, man.

01:13:13.890 --> 01:13:16.124
So you wanna be hard, snowflake?

01:13:16.126 --> 01:13:17.925
Yeah.

01:13:17.927 --> 01:13:20.628
Hey boys, what's going on?

01:13:23.500 --> 01:13:25.099
[Ice] He think he slick too.

01:13:25.101 --> 01:13:26.868
I'm not afraid of you.

01:13:26.870 --> 01:13:29.003
Oh, you ain't afraid of me.

01:13:29.172 --> 01:13:30.772
Have at him.

01:13:30.774 --> 01:13:33.975
[gun fires]

01:13:38.715 --> 01:13:40.748
-O'Brien, Jaymie.
-You OK, man?

01:13:40.750 --> 01:13:44.485
Come on, come on, don't
leave me, call 911, Nolin!

01:13:44.487 --> 01:13:45.086
[Mark] Yeah.

01:13:45.088 --> 01:13:46.654
[Mac] Stay with me,
Jaymie, it's OK.

01:13:46.656 --> 01:13:49.157
-You know these guys?
-It's gonna be OK,

01:13:49.159 --> 01:13:50.658
-Jaymie, Jaymie.
-Yeah, hi.

01:13:50.660 --> 01:13:54.562
We're at 8th and Poplar, one
of our students has been shot.

01:13:54.564 --> 01:13:56.898
Shh, oh my god,
Jaymie, it's gonna be OK.

01:13:56.900 --> 01:14:00.168
Come on, Jaymie, Jaymie!
[echoing]

01:14:07.477 --> 01:14:09.076
[Doctor] Are you the family?

01:14:09.078 --> 01:14:11.679
[Mark]
Well, tonight we are.

01:14:11.681 --> 01:14:15.216
OK, well,
Jaymie was shot twice.

01:14:15.218 --> 01:14:18.686
Once in the upper back,
and once in the lower back.

01:14:18.688 --> 01:14:22.623
The second bullet just
barely missed his spine.

01:14:22.625 --> 01:14:24.725
He's extremely lucky.

01:14:24.727 --> 01:14:25.626
Can we see him?

01:14:25.628 --> 01:14:27.929
I'm sorry, these
are gunshot wounds.

01:14:27.931 --> 01:14:31.098
There are procedures.
Jaymie's asleep right now

01:14:31.100 --> 01:14:33.534
and I really need him
to stay that way.

01:14:33.536 --> 01:14:39.207
Trust me, he'll be
here for awhile.

01:14:40.143 --> 01:14:42.176
Thank you, Doctor.

01:14:42.779 --> 01:14:46.180
OK, well, Tuna,
we'll take you home.

01:14:46.182 --> 01:14:47.081
I can't.

01:14:47.083 --> 01:14:50.852
[Mark] He's in good hands,
he's a strong kid.

01:14:50.854 --> 01:14:51.519
Come on.

01:14:51.521 --> 01:14:52.920
[Tuna] I can't just
leave him here.

01:14:52.922 --> 01:14:56.724
It's my fault.
[cries]

01:15:12.141 --> 01:15:13.774
[Kate] Mac?

01:15:13.776 --> 01:15:18.713
[Mac cries]

01:15:24.287 --> 01:15:27.121
[mumbles tearfully]

01:15:28.725 --> 01:15:31.559
It's OK, it's OK.

01:15:35.798 --> 01:15:38.633
[Mac] <i> Come on, Jaymie, Jaymie.</i>

01:15:38.635 --> 01:15:41.869
<i> Oh my god, Jaymie, it's OK,</i>

01:15:41.871 --> 01:15:45.139
<i> it's OK, it's OK, Jaymie.</i>

01:15:45.141 --> 01:15:49.277
<i> Stay awake, Jaymie,</i>
<i> Jaymie, Jaymie!</i>

01:15:52.048 --> 01:15:55.049
[mellow music]

01:16:25.782 --> 01:16:29.150
-Come on, guys.
-What's all this about?

01:16:29.152 --> 01:16:34.322
Have a seat. Thanks
for coming, guys, thank you.

01:16:39.362 --> 01:16:43.664
Hey, guys, Principal Wade
wants to talk to you.

01:16:44.233 --> 01:16:45.933
Boys.

01:16:46.736 --> 01:16:49.036
I really hate
to have to tell you,

01:16:50.006 --> 01:16:52.106
but the School Board
is suspending rugby.

01:16:52.108 --> 01:16:53.074
-What?
-What?

01:16:53.076 --> 01:16:55.076
That's not fair, this had
nothin' to do with The Nomads.

01:16:55.078 --> 01:16:57.979
How about the school board
lets us use a safer field?

01:16:57.981 --> 01:17:00.081
I wish it was that easy.

01:17:00.083 --> 01:17:01.349
But because of
the circumstances,

01:17:01.351 --> 01:17:03.985
I'm afraid there's
no other option.

01:17:03.987 --> 01:17:06.253
-This is bullshit.
-Hey, come on.

01:17:06.255 --> 01:17:08.289
So, you're just gonna
let them tear down

01:17:08.291 --> 01:17:10.191
everything we built?

01:17:10.193 --> 01:17:12.293
It was my job to keep you safe.

01:17:13.296 --> 01:17:16.063
I failed.

01:17:16.065 --> 01:17:18.132
We need this team.

01:17:18.301 --> 01:17:20.167
I'm stepping down at Whitman,

01:17:20.169 --> 01:17:24.105
I'll be leaving after midterms.
Excuse me.

01:17:24.107 --> 01:17:25.806
Where you going?

01:17:26.743 --> 01:17:28.843
[Mark sighs]

01:17:29.779 --> 01:17:33.047
OK, boys, that's it for now.

01:17:33.049 --> 01:17:35.049
You all should head
to the cafeteria.

01:17:35.051 --> 01:17:38.986
'Cause that's
a safe place, right?

01:17:39.889 --> 01:17:41.722
Come on, y'all.

01:17:46.162 --> 01:17:48.095
Sorry, guys.

01:17:48.097 --> 01:17:50.898
I know you're disappointed.

01:17:53.870 --> 01:17:56.103
[mellow music]

01:17:56.105 --> 01:17:59.373
[Kate] <i> OK, well they</i>
<i> absolutely loved you,</i>

01:17:59.375 --> 01:18:00.408
<i> but now I feel terrible.</i>

01:18:00.410 --> 01:18:03.244
<i> Maybe I was wrong,</i>
<i> those kids clearly need you.</i>

01:18:03.246 --> 01:18:04.912
Don't turn on me now.

01:18:04.914 --> 01:18:09.183
It'll be great,
we'll be together again
drinking cappuccinos.

01:18:09.185 --> 01:18:10.284
[Kate] <i> Yeah.</i>

01:18:10.286 --> 01:18:12.086
<i> -Mac, listen--</i>
-I gotta go.

01:18:12.088 --> 01:18:14.055
Be home soon.

01:18:15.291 --> 01:18:16.090
I'm good.

01:18:16.092 --> 01:18:22.797
Jeez, you clean up nice.
You mind?

01:18:26.969 --> 01:18:29.904
Oh my god, that is good.

01:18:32.041 --> 01:18:34.475
You probably don't
remember this, but...

01:18:34.477 --> 01:18:37.478
my third year of
coaching with your dad,

01:18:37.480 --> 01:18:38.913
we had this kid Freddie.

01:18:38.915 --> 01:18:41.982
Incredible athlete, big heart,

01:18:41.984 --> 01:18:44.452
everybody just loved him,
he had tons of potential,

01:18:44.454 --> 01:18:50.191
but he had this
serious drug problem.

01:18:50.193 --> 01:18:52.359
We had this intervention,

01:18:52.361 --> 01:18:54.962
thankfully,
he agreed to treatment.

01:18:54.964 --> 01:18:57.965
Cut to the chase,
how long did it take you

01:18:57.967 --> 01:19:01.969
to get him cleaned up and
get him back on the field?

01:19:03.039 --> 01:19:05.806
He OD'd the night
before treatment.

01:19:05.808 --> 01:19:08.943
His mother found
him in the basement.

01:19:10.847 --> 01:19:12.747
I'm sorry.

01:19:12.749 --> 01:19:16.016
I didn't even know
if I could teach.

01:19:16.018 --> 01:19:19.420
But your father
wouldn't let me quit.

01:19:19.422 --> 01:19:22.923
'Cause there's always
another kid coming along

01:19:22.925 --> 01:19:25.993
who needs our help,
who we teach, who we coach,

01:19:25.995 --> 01:19:29.130
and if that's
who we truly are then,

01:19:29.132 --> 01:19:32.199
that's what we do, right?

01:19:33.336 --> 01:19:36.170
We show up...

01:19:36.172 --> 01:19:39.507
we move forward.

01:19:44.147 --> 01:19:48.115
The kids' video
won that contest.

01:19:48.117 --> 01:19:51.152
Check it out
when you have a sec.

-Whit, what?

-Hey.
-Hey.

01:21:27.083 --> 01:21:28.182
The video won.

01:21:28.184 --> 01:21:30.918
Of course, that jawn was tight.

01:21:30.920 --> 01:21:33.487
I heard Banner created
like 100 profiles

01:21:33.489 --> 01:21:35.990
and voted on all of them.

01:21:37.326 --> 01:21:40.995
Ice, I don't want him to
cause you no trouble--

01:21:40.997 --> 01:21:41.962
He won't.

01:21:41.964 --> 01:21:44.031
The cops arrested
all three of them

01:21:44.033 --> 01:21:48.636
and now ICE is a three-time
loser who was out on parole.

01:21:48.938 --> 01:21:53.340
We won't be seeing him
for a very long time.

01:21:53.342 --> 01:21:57.011
The first to raise
his fist loses, right?

01:21:59.115 --> 01:22:02.583
Right.

01:22:02.585 --> 01:22:06.320
Jaymie, I'm so sorry.

01:22:06.322 --> 01:22:08.956
-I should've been there and--
-Coach.

01:22:08.958 --> 01:22:14.194
This isn't your fault,
I got myself into this.

01:22:14.196 --> 01:22:20.234
See, I used isn't
instead of ain't.

01:22:20.236 --> 01:22:21.702
Boy.

01:22:21.704 --> 01:22:23.003
How did you get to be so strong?

01:22:23.005 --> 01:22:26.540
I've been sharing
Tuna's protein salads.

01:22:26.542 --> 01:22:29.143
[laughs]

01:22:29.712 --> 01:22:31.946
Did your mom bring you that?

01:22:32.381 --> 01:22:34.415
Nah, O'Brien did.

01:22:35.051 --> 01:22:37.251
She came here the other day.

01:22:37.253 --> 01:22:40.187
I'll see her when I get home.

01:22:40.189 --> 01:22:43.557
Wait, your mom came once.

01:22:44.460 --> 01:22:49.263
She's a good mom,
but she's using.

01:22:51.200 --> 01:22:54.501
She's not my mom,
she's somebody else.

01:22:54.503 --> 01:22:57.271
Can't get mad at her
when she's like that.

01:22:57.273 --> 01:23:00.374
Stuff makes her crazy,
she's just doing

01:23:00.376 --> 01:23:02.576
the best she can, you know?

01:23:03.379 --> 01:23:05.746
Anyway, I know you
don't like hearing this,

01:23:05.748 --> 01:23:10.651
but you've been more of
a mom than she has lately.

01:23:17.093 --> 01:23:20.094
I don't mind
hearing that at all.

01:23:20.096 --> 01:23:23.330
[gentle music]

01:23:40.349 --> 01:23:42.082
Sober.

01:23:46.389 --> 01:23:48.389

01:24:11.814 --> 01:24:13.580
Mom?

01:24:26.695 --> 01:24:28.429
Hi.

01:24:53.789 --> 01:24:59.259
I owe all of you an apology.
I forgot something.

01:24:59.728 --> 01:25:01.762
That if I mess up
or have a problem,

01:25:01.764 --> 01:25:06.200
I can lean on my team
to help me back up.

01:25:07.269 --> 01:25:12.239
I always had trouble
needing other people,

01:25:12.241 --> 01:25:15.442
ever since I was your age.

01:25:16.178 --> 01:25:19.580
I should've told
you when we started

01:25:19.582 --> 01:25:22.483
that I can't be perfect.

01:25:22.485 --> 01:25:24.751
I won't be.

01:25:25.554 --> 01:25:28.255
I'm truly sorry.

01:25:30.259 --> 01:25:34.328
It's really hard
for me to say this, but...

01:25:35.131 --> 01:25:37.764
I need you guys right now.

01:25:39.201 --> 01:25:41.201
I need your help.

01:25:42.571 --> 01:25:44.872
I need my team.

01:25:51.514 --> 01:25:54.882
Whatever it is, I'm in.

01:25:57.253 --> 01:25:59.219
Name it.

01:25:59.688 --> 01:26:03.323
We got your back, what's up?

01:26:06.562 --> 01:26:09.763
Any chance you all have
collared shirts?

01:26:12.334 --> 01:26:13.867
[laughs]

01:26:13.869 --> 01:26:14.635
[bangs]

01:26:14.637 --> 01:26:17.771
The board grants
Cassey McNamara the floor.

01:26:21.177 --> 01:26:23.210
Thank you.

01:26:23.212 --> 01:26:25.279
I'm a teacher at
Whitman High School

01:26:25.281 --> 01:26:29.683
which absorbed two other
schools after the closures.

01:26:30.286 --> 01:26:37.558
We also coach a rugby team
called The Nomads,

01:26:37.560 --> 01:26:38.792
or we did.

01:26:38.794 --> 01:26:41.562
Our team was recently
disbanded by this board

01:26:41.564 --> 01:26:44.264
after an unfortunate incident.

01:26:45.634 --> 01:26:47.634
They...

01:26:47.636 --> 01:26:53.373
We were victims and
we're now being punished.

01:26:53.876 --> 01:26:57.211
Without understanding rugby
it's hard to understand

01:26:57.213 --> 01:27:00.347
why it means
so much to these boys.

01:27:00.349 --> 01:27:04.818
So I thought they should
tell you themselves.

01:27:07.823 --> 01:27:11.291
[gentle music]

01:27:16.532 --> 01:27:19.900
This is life.

01:27:19.902 --> 01:27:25.339
Always moving forward,
but with plenty of setbacks

01:27:25.341 --> 01:27:26.573
and that's OK because--

01:27:26.575 --> 01:27:29.376
In rugby, we learn to
fight through the pain.

01:27:29.378 --> 01:27:31.845
Life is better when
you stick together.

01:27:31.847 --> 01:27:34.848
On and off the pitch,
sometimes you gotta go backward

01:27:34.850 --> 01:27:35.682
to go forward.

01:27:35.684 --> 01:27:39.453
For us, the real world
doesn't come with pads.

01:27:39.455 --> 01:27:41.255
You gotta brace yourself.

01:27:41.257 --> 01:27:43.824
Expect people
to take cheap shots.

01:27:43.826 --> 01:27:47.828
You gotta watch
yourselves, a'ight?

01:27:50.532 --> 01:27:51.598
Look.

01:27:51.600 --> 01:27:55.302
We know you're only
trying to do what's best,

01:27:55.304 --> 01:27:59.573
but for us,
this team is everything

01:27:59.875 --> 01:28:02.409
and we owe it to these coaches.

01:28:02.411 --> 01:28:04.778
They told us how to
be proud of ourselves

01:28:04.780 --> 01:28:06.847
and our communities.

01:28:08.017 --> 01:28:11.585
It's not easy to survive
where we come from.

01:28:11.587 --> 01:28:15.789
A place where graduating
high school is a coin flip.

01:28:15.791 --> 01:28:19.760
The status quo around here
isn't designed for hope.

01:28:21.397 --> 01:28:24.631
But because of them,

01:28:24.633 --> 01:28:26.633
for the first time in my life,

01:28:26.635 --> 01:28:30.404
I can see the possibilities.

01:28:30.406 --> 01:28:32.306
We're products of a system
that doesn't provide

01:28:32.308 --> 01:28:36.777
a lot of resources, and
yet we made the best of it.

01:28:38.981 --> 01:28:42.649
We need this team,
and I hope you reconsider

01:28:42.651 --> 01:28:45.052
taking that away from us.

01:28:50.726 --> 01:28:54.061
Unfortunately, boys,
we've already discussed

01:28:54.063 --> 01:28:55.929
this matter and decided.

01:28:56.865 --> 01:29:02.002
But I suppose this counts
as new information.

01:29:02.004 --> 01:29:05.472
Anyone here opposed
to a new vote?

01:29:06.575 --> 01:29:07.741
OK.

01:29:07.743 --> 01:29:11.011
All in favor of reversing
the cancellation

01:29:11.013 --> 01:29:14.414
of the rugby program
at Whitman High.

I love you, guys.
Look around you.

way together, right?

You showed up,
you're prepared, right?

01:30:53.048 --> 01:30:55.649
I'm so proud of you!
Now get out there

01:30:55.651 --> 01:30:59.052

respect each other, you got it?

01:30:59.054 --> 01:31:00.554

01:32:30.746 --> 01:32:31.878
<i> ¶ We need a jump ¶</i>

01:32:31.880 --> 01:32:32.846

01:32:32.848 --> 01:32:34.681

01:32:34.683 --> 01:32:36.650

01:32:47.896 --> 01:32:51.097
If you're here because
you love football,

01:32:51.099 --> 01:32:51.998
I have great news.

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:54.601
Rugby is the first version
of football ever played.

01:32:54.603 --> 01:33:00.874
It's a game of passion,
excitement, commitment,
and beauty.

01:33:01.209 --> 01:33:05.645
Nomads, you will
respect yourselves,

01:33:05.647 --> 01:33:09.950
respect each other and
always do your best.

01:33:09.952 --> 01:33:12.252
You will earn your jersey.

01:33:12.254 --> 01:33:16.356
Look around, learn to
lean on each other.

01:33:16.358 --> 01:33:20.961
You don't lose alone,
and you can't win alone.

01:33:20.963 --> 01:33:22.596
So, what do you say?

01:33:22.598 --> 01:33:25.699
Yo, Coach, blow the
whistle, let's play.

01:33:25.701 --> 01:33:32.772
