WEBVTT

00:01.566 --> 00:03.046
Previously onDynasty...What did we do?

00:03.090 --> 00:05.831
You broke your vows.
I broke mine.

00:05.875 --> 00:07.920
Carrington Atlantic oil tankersare being held up

00:07.964 --> 00:09.487
in Moldavian shipping lanes.

00:09.531 --> 00:12.751
Fuel up the jet.
We're going to Moldavia.

00:12.795 --> 00:14.623
Blake and Anders had sometrouble with the government.

00:14.666 --> 00:15.319
They've been kidnapped.

00:23.458 --> 00:24.676
Were you thinking

00:24.720 --> 00:26.330
someone unlocked itin the past five minutes?

00:26.374 --> 00:29.551
Just get nervous energy when I'mtrapped in a foreign dungeon.

00:29.594 --> 00:32.075
Plus, if we could just
speak to the king,

00:32.119 --> 00:34.251
perhaps we can straighten
this whole thing out.

00:34.295 --> 00:35.905
Well, who do you think
brought us here?

00:35.948 --> 00:37.428
He may not wantto talk to me.

00:37.472 --> 00:39.082
I thought Blake Carrington
could close any deal.

00:39.126 --> 00:40.605
There wouldn't be
a deal to close

00:40.649 --> 00:43.086
if Laura Van Kirk
hadn't screwed me over

00:43.130 --> 00:44.479
when she sold me back CA.

00:46.133 --> 00:48.222
The king can hear you
from his quarters.

00:48.265 --> 00:50.093
Keep quiet.Well, if the king's awake,

00:50.137 --> 00:52.095
perhaps he'd like
to have a little chat

00:52.139 --> 00:53.923
and we can explainwhat's going on.

00:53.966 --> 00:55.794
He is aware of
your situation.

00:57.448 --> 00:59.102
But are you?

00:59.146 --> 01:01.278
I'm the head
of the security services.

01:01.322 --> 01:02.671
I'm aware of everything.

01:02.714 --> 01:04.542
The way I see it,
this ends with him losing.

01:04.586 --> 01:05.891
So, you know,you can choose

01:05.935 --> 01:08.155
to let us go right now
and secure your future,

01:08.198 --> 01:09.373
or...

01:09.417 --> 01:11.071
wait and see what happens.

01:11.114 --> 01:13.812
I'm very patient.

01:13.856 --> 01:15.510
Ah.

01:16.772 --> 01:19.340
Your funeral.
I guess

01:19.383 --> 01:20.950
we can cross getting trapped

01:20.993 --> 01:22.821
in a Moldavian dungeon off
our bucket list.Excuse

01:22.865 --> 01:25.302
my bluntness, sir, but are you
out of your freaking mind?!

01:25.346 --> 01:28.000
Do you understandthe gravity of the situation?

01:28.044 --> 01:29.959
Yeah, I understand gravity
like Einstein.

01:30.002 --> 01:31.656
We were captured
five hours ago,

01:31.700 --> 01:34.050
which means our pilot's alreadyon his way home,

01:34.094 --> 01:35.443
and he's notified the family.

01:37.227 --> 01:39.925
It was Newtonwho discovered gravity,

01:39.969 --> 01:41.013
not Einstein.

01:41.057 --> 01:41.579
JENNINGS:
So, what's

01:41.623 --> 01:44.365
our next move?

01:45.583 --> 01:47.498
Your next move isto stay put.

01:47.542 --> 01:48.891
No one can find outabout this.

01:48.934 --> 01:50.980
Otherwise, we risk a leak
to the press.

01:51.023 --> 01:53.722
The last thing we want isto put Father in more danger.

01:53.765 --> 01:56.159
I'm gonna go.

01:56.203 --> 01:59.075
So this isn't
about Blake's safety.

01:59.119 --> 02:01.208
It's about you
wanting to be a hero

02:01.251 --> 02:03.514
to get back on
Daddy's good side?

02:03.558 --> 02:05.168
And if no one can know,
what is Liam doing here?

02:05.212 --> 02:07.779
My family's done businessin Moldavia.

02:07.823 --> 02:09.303
I've been there,and I've already reached out

02:09.346 --> 02:12.132
to a few contactsof my mother's.

02:12.175 --> 02:13.785
And he got us the
blueprints for the palace,

02:13.829 --> 02:15.700
where the politicalprisoners are taken.

02:15.744 --> 02:17.963
Great. So why don't
we send the blueprints

02:18.007 --> 02:19.661
to an actual
international rescue group,

02:19.704 --> 02:22.316
instead of depending
on a doctor and a...

02:22.359 --> 02:24.274
Well...A writer?

02:24.318 --> 02:25.623
ADAM:Because

02:25.667 --> 02:27.190
the UN advises all

02:27.234 --> 02:28.670
international rescue groups
not to go to Moldavia.

02:28.713 --> 02:31.020
Private securitywon't even go there.

02:31.063 --> 02:33.501
So what makes you
think youcan do it?Look, look,

02:33.544 --> 02:35.155
we're not going
there to fight.

02:35.198 --> 02:36.678
We're simply
going there

02:36.721 --> 02:38.288
to casually break in and...

02:38.332 --> 02:39.855
BOTH:
Unkidnap...

02:39.898 --> 02:41.509
Two innocent people.

02:41.552 --> 02:43.859
I think we should tell Fallon.

02:43.902 --> 02:45.687
Yeah. Have
you met Fallon?

02:45.730 --> 02:47.689
In, like, three minutes,
she's gonna have CIA,

02:47.732 --> 02:49.734
IDF, several small armies

02:49.778 --> 02:52.172
swarming Moldavia, basically
starting World War III.

02:52.215 --> 02:53.869
She does tendto go big.

02:53.912 --> 02:56.176
But she'd also know what
to do. I'm sure she's had

02:56.219 --> 02:57.351
to deal with this kind
of thing before.

02:57.394 --> 02:59.004
So have I, remember?

02:59.048 --> 03:00.354
Kidnapped for 30 years?

03:00.397 --> 03:02.704
Do you even care
about getting Blake home,

03:02.747 --> 03:03.922
or you want more time off

03:03.966 --> 03:05.489
from your husband
so you can go to church?

03:05.533 --> 03:07.187
What is that supposed to mean?

03:07.230 --> 03:08.623
It means you seemto like getting

03:08.666 --> 03:10.233
on your knees these daysand praying, don't you?

03:10.277 --> 03:11.669
LIAM:Enough.

03:14.368 --> 03:16.239
VKI agreedto let us use the plane.Great.

03:16.283 --> 03:18.459
What if Fallon finds out?Once we're all back

03:18.502 --> 03:20.287
safely, she'll understand.

03:20.330 --> 03:21.810
And I hope you will, too.

03:25.074 --> 03:26.945
ALEXIS:
To be honest, Joanne,

03:26.989 --> 03:29.470
I would wait
as long as possible.

03:29.513 --> 03:31.646
Why ruin
a promising relationship

03:31.689 --> 03:33.865
by revealing
you have a child so quickly?

03:33.909 --> 03:35.867
If things work out, well,

03:35.911 --> 03:38.218
there'll be plenty of time
for them to get acquainted.

03:38.261 --> 03:41.830
Remember, patience is
the virtue, not children.

03:41.873 --> 03:44.006
JOANNE:You're a lifesaver, Aunt Alexis.WOMAN: Ms. Carrington!

03:44.049 --> 03:45.921
I'm telling you, before I calledyou, I didn't know what to do

03:45.964 --> 03:48.967
with my life. I...Great question.
Please call again.

03:49.011 --> 03:50.926
We've just been served.

03:50.969 --> 03:52.797
You can't just bargeinto my show like that.

03:52.841 --> 03:55.496
It's my show, and I can,
because apparently

03:55.539 --> 03:57.280
a woman named Joyce Doyle

03:57.324 --> 04:00.283
called into Ask Alexis,
asking for a career change.

04:00.327 --> 04:01.980
And you told her to
get behind the wheel

04:02.024 --> 04:04.200
and drive without
looking back.Great advice.

04:04.244 --> 04:06.594
Oh, really?
Because Joyce took that advice

04:06.637 --> 04:08.248
and she got into a car accident.

04:08.291 --> 04:09.945
She broke her
left leg and

04:09.988 --> 04:12.208
her right arm,
and now she's suing me and you

04:12.252 --> 04:13.949
and the company for damages.

04:13.992 --> 04:15.516
This is nonsense.Everybody knows

04:15.559 --> 04:17.953
that I meant the wheel of life,not the wheel of a...

04:17.996 --> 04:20.608
A 1995 LeBaron?

04:22.349 --> 04:25.134
Come on. She was askingfor it. If everyone

04:25.177 --> 04:27.310
took my advice literally,
we would be in big trouble.

04:27.354 --> 04:30.139
We arein big trouble!No, we're not.That's a frivolous charge.

04:30.182 --> 04:32.533
Plus, there's this thingcalled freedom of speech.

04:32.576 --> 04:35.623
It's an amendment thingie.The first amendment?

04:35.666 --> 04:37.886
Oh, wow. Your expertise
in the law is really

04:37.929 --> 04:39.714
not making me feel
better right now.

04:39.757 --> 04:41.585
Fine. Call a lawyer if you want.

04:41.629 --> 04:42.978
They'll tell you the same.

04:43.021 --> 04:44.632
At least my advice is free.

04:44.675 --> 04:47.287
Free? Your advice is going
to cost me millions

04:47.330 --> 04:48.940
of dollars in legal fees!

04:48.984 --> 04:50.333
MICHAEL:
I got to say,

04:50.377 --> 04:52.379
I was worriedabout the show at first,

04:52.422 --> 04:54.294
but it has been nothing
but positive

04:54.337 --> 04:55.599
for myself and the Atlantix.

04:55.643 --> 04:57.384
This is just
the beginning.

04:57.427 --> 05:00.387
The network is already working
on an offer for season two.

05:00.430 --> 05:04.173
Oh. I thought I was going on tour.

05:04.216 --> 05:07.089
W-Well, why don't you just
put that in your new deal?

05:07.132 --> 05:09.483
And whatever else you want.If they're excited

05:09.526 --> 05:12.224
about the show, we needto strike while the iron is hot.

05:12.268 --> 05:14.531
We got to get whatwe can while we can.

05:14.575 --> 05:16.272
To getting it all.

05:16.316 --> 05:17.882
MICHAEL:Amen.

05:20.450 --> 05:22.104
Mm.

05:22.147 --> 05:23.932
I'll be right back.

05:28.240 --> 05:29.720
What's that text?

05:29.764 --> 05:32.070
Let's just say success has

05:32.114 --> 05:34.508
a way of opening
previously locked doors.

05:34.551 --> 05:36.118
KIRBY:Why are you

05:36.161 --> 05:38.294
still dealing with them?
You're like Kourtney

05:38.338 --> 05:39.687
when she kept going
back to Scott,

05:39.730 --> 05:41.123
thinking this time
it would work out.

05:41.166 --> 05:43.691
I-I don't know who eitherof those people are,

05:43.734 --> 05:45.693
but this is just business.

05:45.736 --> 05:47.434
Okay, well, while you're still
doing business with them,

05:47.477 --> 05:49.697
you can find someone else
to vent to, because I'm done

05:49.740 --> 05:51.394
listening to you complain
about being betrayed.

05:51.438 --> 05:52.917
And I'm done complaining.

05:52.961 --> 05:54.528
I've got a new approach.

05:54.571 --> 05:56.138
Since I already knowthey're using me,

05:56.181 --> 05:58.445
I'm flipping it,using them right back.

05:58.488 --> 06:00.447
This time is gonna be different.

06:02.623 --> 06:05.016
Classic Kourtney.

06:05.060 --> 06:07.236
I'll see you at the hangar
in an hour. Okay.

06:09.064 --> 06:11.545
So, I was invitedto give the keynote speech

06:11.588 --> 06:14.374
at a 30 Under 30ATL Entrepreneurs banquet.

06:14.417 --> 06:16.201
Well, congratulations.
You should probably

06:16.245 --> 06:17.420
start working on that,
'cause I got to get to...

06:17.464 --> 06:18.856
Yeah, but I thinkI'm turning it down.

06:18.900 --> 06:20.554
I mean, what are theyhonoring me for?

06:20.597 --> 06:23.470
Sneaking mistresses out of hotelrooms inside laundry carts?

06:23.513 --> 06:26.037
Which, yes, is a skill, butI can't put that in my speech.

06:26.081 --> 06:27.474
Yeah, but you have
a ton to be proud of.

06:27.517 --> 06:30.259
Do I? The whole thingwith Ramy screwed me up.

06:30.302 --> 06:31.608
I mean, I realizedthat the only

06:31.652 --> 06:33.523
real difference between usis that I married rich.

06:33.567 --> 06:35.786
Without that, I'd still bebreaking into people's houses

06:35.830 --> 06:38.223
through the air vent justto steal their leftovers

06:38.267 --> 06:40.574
and watch Desperado. Desperado?

06:40.617 --> 06:42.010
Yeah, people in my neighborhood

06:42.053 --> 06:43.446
were all really bigDanny Trejo fans.

06:43.490 --> 06:45.753
But who isn't?I mean, the guy has no fear.

06:45.796 --> 06:48.059
And a machete.Look, I don't
want to be rude,

06:48.103 --> 06:50.888
but I really have to...Yeah, you have to goto the hangar. I heard.

06:50.932 --> 06:53.195
I'm workingon my listening skills.

06:53.238 --> 06:54.762
So, where are you going,anyway?

06:54.805 --> 06:57.112
Oh, just a...
a business trip.

06:57.155 --> 06:59.680
But you're a writer.What does that even mean?

06:59.723 --> 07:01.464
Like... movie rights?

07:01.508 --> 07:04.467
Okay. You're a terrible liar.

07:04.511 --> 07:06.730
This is about yourbachelor party, isn't it?

07:06.774 --> 07:09.994
Yes. Yes.

07:10.038 --> 07:12.475
Totally. I'm planning a
little bachelor party scout,

07:12.519 --> 07:14.782
but I'm keeping it
a secret from everyone,

07:14.825 --> 07:16.784
because I-I want you guys
to be surprised.Mm.

07:16.827 --> 07:19.613
So if-if you don't mind,
I, uh... I got to go.

07:19.656 --> 07:21.658
Scout.

07:25.532 --> 07:27.969
I'm sorry

07:28.012 --> 07:29.449
I dragged you into this.

07:29.492 --> 07:32.147
Oh, you didn't drag meinto anything.

07:32.190 --> 07:33.627
I volunteered.

07:33.670 --> 07:35.629
We're in this together.

07:35.672 --> 07:38.675
Hey, if you could snap
your fingers right now

07:38.719 --> 07:40.808
and be somewhere else,
where would it be?

07:40.851 --> 07:42.505
You mean, apartfrom the manor?

07:42.549 --> 07:43.985
Yeah, yeah, someplace bigger.
I mean, I'd want to go

07:44.028 --> 07:47.336
to the moon,
so what about you?

07:47.379 --> 07:49.120
I'd rather not say.

07:49.164 --> 07:51.122
Come on. We're stuck
in a Moldavian prison.

07:51.166 --> 07:52.776
We don't know if we're
ever gonna get out.

07:52.820 --> 07:54.648
If now is not
the time to share

07:54.691 --> 07:56.519
your hopes and dreams,
I don't know when is.

07:56.563 --> 07:59.609
Well, if you insist.I've always wanted

07:59.653 --> 08:01.959
to open a beachfront restaurantin New Zealand.

08:02.003 --> 08:04.962
Are you kidding me? Restaurants
are terrible businesses.

08:05.006 --> 08:07.138
They hardly ever
turn a profit.

08:07.182 --> 08:09.576
And you wonder whyI didn't want to tell you.

08:12.448 --> 08:15.233
Are you readyto make a deal?

08:15.277 --> 08:18.323
No, and the king
has a proposition.

08:18.367 --> 08:21.022
Clearly, the captains of the
tankers will not negotiate

08:21.065 --> 08:23.198
with our people
without your okay.

08:23.241 --> 08:26.941
Those tankers are not
leaving Moldavian waters.

08:26.984 --> 08:29.552
So, call the captains,

08:29.596 --> 08:32.424
order them to turn around
and return the oil.

08:32.468 --> 08:36.037
You do that, and the king
will let you both go.

08:37.212 --> 08:38.735
Do we have a deal?

08:45.263 --> 08:47.265
Well?

08:54.708 --> 08:56.448
When he wakes up,

08:56.492 --> 08:59.713
tell him the king's offer
only lasts until midnight.

08:59.756 --> 09:03.281
After that, the king
becomes a lot less...

09:04.282 --> 09:06.894
...diplomatic.

09:30.613 --> 09:31.962
Is it time to worry yet?

09:32.006 --> 09:33.964
You have until midnightto accept the king's deal.

09:34.008 --> 09:35.487
You know, as a rule,

09:35.531 --> 09:38.708
when a dictator offers you
a way out, you take it.

09:38.752 --> 09:40.971
The oil is the only leverage
we have.

09:41.015 --> 09:42.320
The moment that I agree

09:42.364 --> 09:43.974
to return it is the
moment that I sign

09:44.018 --> 09:46.716
our death certificates, so ourtankers and their ships can sit

09:46.760 --> 09:48.805
in a stalemate
for weeks for all I care.

09:48.849 --> 09:50.633
Weeks?

09:50.677 --> 09:52.504
I thought
someone was coming to save us.

09:52.548 --> 09:55.899
As long as we control
the tankers, we're good.

09:55.943 --> 09:58.119
This king is not gonna risk
an international incident

09:58.162 --> 09:59.686
by shooting at them.

10:01.775 --> 10:04.168
So we're not making a deal.

10:04.212 --> 10:07.955
FALLON: Well, I don't care how
many lawyers you have to use.

10:07.998 --> 10:10.174
Your job is
to defend Fallon Unlimited.

10:10.218 --> 10:13.003
Otherwise, what am I paying you$1,000 an hour for?

10:13.047 --> 10:14.657
A thousand an hour?

10:14.701 --> 10:17.921
Wow. I'm, uh, workingfor the wrong firm.

10:17.965 --> 10:19.357
Hey. Evan.

10:19.401 --> 10:22.534
Uh, trust me,
you are better off

10:22.578 --> 10:23.927
not representing us right now.

10:23.971 --> 10:25.668
Hmm.So what are you doing here?

10:25.712 --> 10:27.670
Well, I'm still cc'don the company's legal e-mails,

10:27.714 --> 10:29.280
since I helped set it up,

10:29.324 --> 10:31.979
so I know about the lawsuit,and I have some thoughts.

10:32.022 --> 10:34.546
Well, I can only offer you
a penny for them,

10:34.590 --> 10:37.506
since you just heard
what I'm paying my attorneys.I'm sure

10:37.549 --> 10:39.943
your firm will crush the case,which is why I'm worried.

10:39.987 --> 10:41.945
Why? Fallon Unlimited is
about empowerment,

10:41.989 --> 10:43.947
and what better way
to send that message

10:43.991 --> 10:45.949
than getting your opponent
to crash and burn?

10:47.211 --> 10:49.039
I realize now that
that was a bad metaphor

10:49.083 --> 10:50.780
because the woman
actually crashed her car.

10:50.824 --> 10:52.564
The message it sends
is that your company

10:52.608 --> 10:53.957
will destroy anything
in its way.

10:54.001 --> 10:55.567
Hmm.This is a woman,

10:55.611 --> 10:57.047
not another corporation.

10:57.091 --> 10:58.788
People root for the underdog.

10:58.832 --> 11:00.311
And in simple PR terms,

11:00.355 --> 11:02.705
you may win in legal court,
but...

11:02.749 --> 11:04.402
But I'll losein the court of public opinion,

11:04.446 --> 11:05.752
and my company
will be in trouble.

11:05.795 --> 11:08.493
Right? So what do
you suggest we do?

11:08.537 --> 11:09.712
Settle.

11:09.756 --> 11:11.671
I know this type of personfrom my years

11:11.714 --> 11:13.673
as a social worker
and public defender.

11:13.716 --> 11:15.762
Unlike you,
she has nothing to lose.

11:15.805 --> 11:17.502
Hmm. Okay.

11:17.546 --> 11:20.244
Well, I'm not calling off
my lawyers just yet,

11:20.288 --> 11:23.160
but I am gonna ask you
to try and settle.

11:24.031 --> 11:25.293
In the meantime,I would keep

11:25.336 --> 11:26.773
your eyes and ears on...

11:26.816 --> 11:28.426
On Alexis.
Yes, I know.

11:28.470 --> 11:30.515
My lawyers,
the insurance company,

11:30.559 --> 11:33.910
and Alexis's personal masseusehave already sounded that alarm.

11:33.954 --> 11:35.346
ALEXIS:
When you're in college,

11:35.390 --> 11:37.740
you can get away with anything.

11:37.784 --> 11:40.177
My advice: take
your professor out for drinks,

11:40.221 --> 11:41.962
and then...

11:43.224 --> 11:44.921
ALEXIS:
I would never say

11:44.965 --> 11:47.619
drug a child to calm him down,

11:47.663 --> 11:50.622
but in his morning cereal,
you can mistakenly

11:50.666 --> 11:53.147
drop in some...

11:53.190 --> 11:55.453
And the way to do it is
just by placing his...

11:57.064 --> 11:59.675
...on your...

11:59.719 --> 12:01.372
And that's how
he'll end up in...

12:02.547 --> 12:03.635
ALEXIS:Okay, I was going

12:03.679 --> 12:05.289
to say "prison."
What is wrong with you?

12:05.333 --> 12:07.030
I'm sorry.Itchy trigger finger.

12:07.074 --> 12:08.945
CARTOF:
I believe you have

12:08.989 --> 12:10.947
what it takes to be
more than a reality star.

12:10.991 --> 12:11.948
Correct.

12:11.992 --> 12:13.210
I want to talk to you

12:13.254 --> 12:14.211
about producing
your own talk show.

12:14.255 --> 12:16.561
You mean on TV?Yep.

12:16.605 --> 12:18.302
I have a group of financiers

12:18.346 --> 12:20.565
that can guarantee three years
of syndicated programming.

12:20.609 --> 12:22.176
The goal is to start local,

12:22.219 --> 12:24.482
expand national,
and then go global.

12:24.526 --> 12:25.875
Like Oprah.

12:25.919 --> 12:28.182
Yeah. You know,
if you're interested,

12:28.225 --> 12:31.054
we should get together againsoon and talk about the details.

12:32.664 --> 12:35.711
I'll call you in a few days.

12:35.755 --> 12:39.454
This has been very...
informative, Mr. Cartof.

12:39.497 --> 12:41.412
Call me Chase.

12:49.986 --> 12:52.162
Hello. You've reached
Father Collins.

12:52.206 --> 12:54.382
I'm not available
to answer your call now.

12:54.425 --> 12:56.079
Have a blessed day.

12:56.123 --> 12:57.951
Caleb,

12:57.994 --> 12:59.604
Blake's in trouble.

12:59.648 --> 13:01.215
He's missing,

13:01.258 --> 13:04.435
and... I'm worriedsomething horrible has happened.

13:06.046 --> 13:09.179
I know this is God's way
of punishing me for what...

13:09.223 --> 13:11.312
what we did.

13:11.355 --> 13:13.053
And...

13:13.096 --> 13:16.186
I know you would probably tryto convince me that I was wrong.

13:16.230 --> 13:17.753
But...

13:17.797 --> 13:20.408
I need to make things right.

13:20.451 --> 13:23.846
I can't keep betraying
the people I care about.

13:25.195 --> 13:28.198
We always knew
this wouldn't end well.

13:28.242 --> 13:30.853
I just think we never knew when.

13:34.639 --> 13:37.251
We can't see each other
anymore, Caleb.

13:39.427 --> 13:40.863
Well...

13:40.907 --> 13:42.952
please don't call me back.

13:48.610 --> 13:51.352
LIAM:  As long as my contact meets us at the palace,

13:51.395 --> 13:53.354
I'm confident
that he can sneak us in,

13:53.397 --> 13:55.660
find Blake and Anders,
and-and get us out alive.

13:57.924 --> 13:59.534
Are we really going through
with this?

13:59.577 --> 14:01.101
What choice do we have?

14:01.144 --> 14:03.190
He's still my father,even though we're not speaking.

14:04.713 --> 14:06.541
I'd never forgive myself
if I didn't try.

14:06.584 --> 14:08.238
SAM:
Hey!

14:08.282 --> 14:09.892
Did someone say"boys' trip"?

14:09.936 --> 14:11.546
LIAM: What the...?SAM: What?

14:11.589 --> 14:13.983
I wasn't gonna let you scoutbachelor parties without me.

14:14.027 --> 14:15.245
Especially now

14:15.289 --> 14:16.899
that I seeyou invited Adam.

14:16.943 --> 14:19.032
Which is a little hurtful,I'm not gonna lie.

14:20.250 --> 14:21.904
We're actually flying
to Moldavia

14:21.948 --> 14:24.472
to try and rescue
Blake and Anders

14:24.515 --> 14:26.387
from kidnappers without
getting ourselves killed.

14:29.172 --> 14:32.741
Okay. So, really,
no one said "boys' trip"?

14:39.139 --> 14:40.183
This is insane.

14:40.227 --> 14:42.142
No, it's gonna be fine.No. I mean,

14:42.185 --> 14:44.492
I just spent a fortune
on party drugs,

14:44.535 --> 14:46.624
thinking that I would get
a semi-naked man

14:46.668 --> 14:48.931
to do tequila shots
off my belly button.

14:48.975 --> 14:50.672
But nowI
might get shot

14:50.715 --> 14:52.804
in my belly button.

14:52.848 --> 14:54.110
Yes, that's definitely
a possibility.

14:54.154 --> 14:55.938
Can we just turn the
plane around and...

14:55.982 --> 14:58.201
drop me off in the Caribbean
or something?

14:58.245 --> 14:59.768
Yeah, we landedabout ten minutes ago.

14:59.811 --> 15:02.292
Why aren't you two
freaking out about this?

15:02.336 --> 15:04.077
Hmm? I mean,
no offense,

15:04.120 --> 15:06.557
but neither one of you is
particularly scary.

15:06.601 --> 15:08.820
You don't have
that Trejo thing going.

15:08.864 --> 15:09.952
What?Don't ask.

15:09.996 --> 15:11.127
No, I'm serious.

15:11.171 --> 15:13.564
I mean, you went blind
after a gas leak.

15:13.608 --> 15:15.088
And you, you
got amnesia

15:15.131 --> 15:17.960
after being hit by,
basically, a flower.I went blind

15:18.004 --> 15:19.962
after an explosion,
not a gas leak.

15:20.006 --> 15:21.094
Anyway,it's gonna work,

15:21.137 --> 15:22.312
because it's a well-
thought-out plan.

15:22.356 --> 15:23.835
The map's gonna lead
us to the palace.

15:23.879 --> 15:25.272
Liam's contact,that I assume will be armed,

15:25.315 --> 15:26.621
is gonna get uspast the guards,

15:26.664 --> 15:28.666
and then he'll bring us back
to the plane.

15:28.710 --> 15:30.277
Okay with you?Fine.

15:30.320 --> 15:32.322
I'll wait here
while youdo the rescuing.

15:32.366 --> 15:34.498
That's probably
for the best.Probably for the best.

15:34.542 --> 15:36.326
Well, you could have
at least pretended

15:36.370 --> 15:37.980
to think about it--
now I don't know

15:38.024 --> 15:38.981
if I'm relieved or offended.

15:39.025 --> 15:40.243
Be relieved, all right?

15:40.287 --> 15:42.245
Take a benzo, relax,and just...

15:42.289 --> 15:44.987
wait for us to get back.

15:45.031 --> 15:47.163
Luckily, I did bring
a pharmacy with me.

15:47.207 --> 15:48.512
EVAN:
I've got great news.

15:48.556 --> 15:49.949
Ah.

15:49.992 --> 15:51.167
Joyce Doyle dropped the suit?

15:51.211 --> 15:53.169
Hmm. Okay, I've got goodnews.

15:53.213 --> 15:54.431
She agreed to settle
for $2 million.

15:54.475 --> 15:56.694
Of course she did.

15:56.738 --> 15:57.957
That isgood news.

15:58.000 --> 15:59.523
You see?
I should be paying you

15:59.567 --> 16:01.177
a thousand
dollars an hour

16:01.221 --> 16:03.527
instead of those mouth breathersI'm paying now. So what's next?

16:03.571 --> 16:04.876
I'll get the paperwork all set,

16:04.920 --> 16:06.269
and you can stop by my office
tomorrow

16:06.313 --> 16:08.532
to sign.Wow. Sounds like a plan.
We'll be there.

16:08.576 --> 16:09.794
EVAN:
If you have
time after,

16:09.838 --> 16:11.927
maybe we can go to lunch
to celebrate.

16:11.971 --> 16:13.146
My treat,

16:13.189 --> 16:14.799
since you'll have
two million less dollars.

16:16.236 --> 16:18.194
Yeah, I'm sure
I could grab a quick bite.

16:18.238 --> 16:20.109
Great. See you tomorrow.

16:20.153 --> 16:21.589
Bye.

16:23.025 --> 16:24.896
You're gonna
keep shaking

16:24.940 --> 16:26.768
your head until I ask why,

16:26.811 --> 16:28.422
right?Well, there are two reasons.

16:28.465 --> 16:30.990
That man likes you,
and I'm not signing anything.

16:31.033 --> 16:32.730
No, he doesn't. And what?

16:32.774 --> 16:35.124
Yes, you are.
We could be done with this.

16:35.168 --> 16:37.735
Exactly.
If I settle, I'm done.

16:37.779 --> 16:38.867
It's admitting guilt.

16:38.910 --> 16:40.477
And as a professional
advice giver...

16:40.521 --> 16:41.652
Not a thing....the moment

16:41.696 --> 16:43.915
I sign that document,
my career is over.

16:43.959 --> 16:45.961
Your career
that lasted one week?

16:46.005 --> 16:48.485
I've had juice cleanses
that have lasted longer.

16:48.529 --> 16:49.921
Fallon, you don't understand.

16:49.965 --> 16:51.053
I do understand, okay?

16:51.097 --> 16:52.576
You want something to do,

16:52.620 --> 16:54.230
and once we settle
this, you and I

16:54.274 --> 16:56.624
can sit down and come upwith a new hobby for you, okay?

16:56.667 --> 16:58.147
Maybe we can even release a line

16:58.191 --> 16:59.627
of Aunt Alexis
lip-plumping kits.

16:59.670 --> 17:00.932
Whatever it is,

17:00.976 --> 17:02.934
you're still signing tomorrow.

17:02.978 --> 17:05.502
ANDERS: Sir, it must be
getting close to midnight.

17:05.546 --> 17:08.505
It's been 24 hours--
someone should be here by now.

17:08.549 --> 17:10.072
And yet there's no one.

17:10.116 --> 17:12.422
The pilot can't have
told the family.

17:12.466 --> 17:13.945
I mean,
he's probably dead by now.

17:13.989 --> 17:15.425
It's really only
a matter of time

17:15.469 --> 17:16.992
before we join him,
unless you turn

17:17.036 --> 17:19.386
those tankers around
and return the oil.

17:19.429 --> 17:20.822
Anders, pleasecalm down.

17:20.865 --> 17:23.607
Calm down? I wish
you'd join me in panicking.

17:37.491 --> 17:38.796
BLAKE:Adam?

17:50.808 --> 17:53.115
Well,

17:53.159 --> 17:55.857
at least we knowthe pilot told the family.

17:57.076 --> 17:59.034
FALLON:
You were supposed to be here

17:59.078 --> 18:01.732
20 minutes ago, Mother--
Evan already called twice.

18:01.776 --> 18:04.953
I'm sorry, but I had to look
at a map first.

18:04.996 --> 18:06.824
Since when do you need a map
to get here?

18:06.868 --> 18:08.696
Is that why you never visited
in 11 years,

18:08.739 --> 18:10.001
because you couldn't find a map?

18:10.045 --> 18:11.481
I am going to Joyce Doyle's.

18:11.525 --> 18:13.309
I'm not signing anything
until I convince her

18:13.353 --> 18:15.137
to drop that lawsuit.

18:15.181 --> 18:18.488
Are you out
of your tiny, tiny mind?

18:18.532 --> 18:20.708
Okay. Gotta go.

18:23.189 --> 18:24.842
BLAKE:
So you basically

18:24.886 --> 18:26.148
just walked right
into their arms?

18:26.192 --> 18:27.976
We didn't know
they were expecting us.

18:28.019 --> 18:30.500
We had a great plan A--
we just didn't get

18:30.544 --> 18:31.675
to execute it.

18:31.719 --> 18:32.720
My contact
turned on us.

18:32.763 --> 18:34.722
He worked for VKI
for 20 years.

18:34.765 --> 18:36.115
He was practically family.Well,

18:36.158 --> 18:38.160
your actually family told me
I needed to come here

18:38.204 --> 18:40.467
to collect my tanker,
so no surprise.

18:40.510 --> 18:42.164
ADAM:Look,

18:42.208 --> 18:43.905
we're all still alive...Thank God

18:43.948 --> 18:45.341
we're alive! Huh?

18:45.385 --> 18:47.735
What a wonderful reunion
you put together for us, Adam.

18:47.778 --> 18:50.346
Maybe we should doThanksgiving here next year.

18:50.390 --> 18:53.219
That is, unless we're dead!

18:54.350 --> 18:55.699
ANDERS:So, when exactly

18:55.743 --> 18:57.571
does plan B kick in?

18:59.225 --> 19:01.531
So, when you say "plan B"...

19:01.575 --> 19:03.098
Well, you saidyou had a plan A,

19:03.142 --> 19:05.144
which means youmust have a plan B,

19:05.187 --> 19:07.842
otherwise the first planwould just be called

19:07.885 --> 19:09.278
"the plan."

19:09.322 --> 19:12.063
BLAKE:No one's coming,are they, Adam?

19:13.239 --> 19:15.197
Because you didn't tell anyone.

19:15.241 --> 19:17.199
I was trying to protect you.Clearly,the only thing

19:17.243 --> 19:19.114
I need protection from is
you and your plan!

19:19.158 --> 19:20.768
ANDERS:
So, no one knows

19:20.811 --> 19:22.944
where we are, and there'sno one else coming?

19:24.380 --> 19:27.209
Well, Sam...is actually still on the plane,

19:27.253 --> 19:28.863
so he could rescue
us at any moment.

19:30.299 --> 19:33.172
We could call that plan Z.

19:43.965 --> 19:46.881
They'll be here any second now.

19:46.924 --> 19:49.318
Just think good thoughts.

19:51.712 --> 19:54.845
Wait, what was I supposed
to be thinking?

19:54.889 --> 19:58.109
MAN: Come on, Sam,
let's get your act together.

20:04.986 --> 20:06.683
Danny Trejo?

20:06.727 --> 20:08.598
Yeah. Trejo in the flesh.

20:10.078 --> 20:11.819
Well, kind of in the flesh.

20:11.862 --> 20:13.560
Whoa!

20:13.603 --> 20:14.778
Man...

20:14.822 --> 20:16.824
I've seen all of your movies.

20:16.867 --> 20:18.478
Well, most of them.

20:18.521 --> 20:20.480
There's, like,
a thousand, but...

20:20.523 --> 20:22.960
You were... you were
kind of my hero growing up.

20:23.004 --> 20:25.398
I wanted to be a
badass just like you.

20:25.441 --> 20:27.617
It didn't really happen.

20:27.661 --> 20:29.967
What do you mean? Everybody's
got a little badass in 'em.

20:30.011 --> 20:32.013
You just got to know
when to let it out.

20:32.056 --> 20:33.188
So, when do
you think

20:33.232 --> 20:35.495
I should do the... letting out?

20:35.538 --> 20:37.148
Nowmight be a good time.

20:37.192 --> 20:39.107
Yeah, that would make sense.

20:39.150 --> 20:40.717
So what happens next?

20:40.761 --> 20:44.112
Hey, I'm a hallucination,
not a psychic.

20:44.155 --> 20:47.681
Yeah, but I think I'm hereto help you save everyone.

20:49.030 --> 20:51.293
But can we do that
from the plane?

20:51.337 --> 20:53.687
Because, uh, yeah,
I've just been lacking

20:53.730 --> 20:55.906
in the confidence department
lately.

20:55.950 --> 20:57.517
Well, you'recertainly not gonna find

20:57.560 --> 20:59.388
your confidencesittin' here.

20:59.432 --> 21:02.522
What I suggest you do isgrab those blueprints,

21:02.565 --> 21:06.308
break into thatEastern European palace, and...

21:06.352 --> 21:08.528
we'll worry
about the rest later.

21:11.226 --> 21:14.882
Joyce, I wantedto sit face-to-face.

21:14.925 --> 21:17.319
Podcasts can beso impersonal.

21:17.363 --> 21:19.626
I just thought if we gotto know each other better,

21:19.669 --> 21:22.150
I could explainhow I did nothing wrong

21:22.193 --> 21:24.065
and gave youthe right advice.Hmm.

21:24.108 --> 21:25.719
Look what
your right advice got me.

21:25.762 --> 21:27.373
That's on you, dear.

21:27.416 --> 21:28.896
Look, I don't wantto judge,

21:28.939 --> 21:31.159
especially since I have no idea

21:31.202 --> 21:32.813
what high school
you nearly graduated from.

21:32.856 --> 21:34.815
Are you really insulting me now?

21:34.858 --> 21:37.644
No. I'm just trying to explain
what a metaphor is.

21:37.687 --> 21:40.081
Stop.Fallon.

21:40.124 --> 21:42.213
You got here so quickly.You were speeding, weren't you?

21:42.257 --> 21:44.390
Driving advice?Really? That's funny.

21:44.433 --> 21:46.261
Hi. You must be Joyce.

21:46.305 --> 21:49.177
Very nice to meet you.

21:49.220 --> 21:51.571
Right. Um,I just came here

21:51.614 --> 21:54.922
to apologize for whatevermy mother has already said.

21:54.965 --> 21:57.577
And to tell you what a lovelyhome you have. Wow.

21:57.620 --> 22:00.406
Look at those party shoes.You know, from a distance,

22:00.449 --> 22:01.929
you can barely tell

22:01.972 --> 22:03.322
they're froma discount warehouse.

22:03.365 --> 22:06.281
Too bad I can't wear them
because of the boot

22:06.325 --> 22:08.588
because of the car accident
your mother caused.

22:08.631 --> 22:10.111
Right.

22:10.154 --> 22:11.591
:I think we should go.What? No.

22:11.634 --> 22:13.593
Joyce and I
were having a splendid time

22:13.636 --> 22:15.377
until you burst in.No, we weren't.

22:15.421 --> 22:16.770
Okay, time to go.Come with me.No, no, we... No.

22:16.813 --> 22:18.119
I'm not coming...No, come with me.Don't fight me!

22:18.162 --> 22:20.513
Fallon, no. Do not fight me.

22:27.215 --> 22:28.651
Go.

22:29.870 --> 22:31.785
You're gonna want
to put some ice on that.

22:31.828 --> 22:33.177
FALLON:
Stop giving advice!

22:34.831 --> 22:37.530
All right. What's next?

22:37.573 --> 22:39.488
Keep your eyes open.

22:39.532 --> 22:41.838
Especially the ones
in the back of your head.

22:41.882 --> 22:43.318
Do I have those?

22:43.362 --> 22:45.799
Hold on a second.

22:45.842 --> 22:49.150
Why do you get to have amachete, and I get a flashlight?

22:49.193 --> 22:51.718
Because I'm not real, dummy.

22:51.761 --> 22:53.502
Mmm.

22:53.546 --> 22:55.852
Focus! Now, like I said,

22:55.896 --> 22:57.463
anyone can kick ass.

22:57.506 --> 22:59.334
We have to figure out

22:59.378 --> 23:02.381
what you're good at
and use it to your advantage.

23:03.512 --> 23:04.905
Hospitality?

23:05.949 --> 23:09.170
Well, we can
serve them to death.

23:09.213 --> 23:11.215
We sure can.

23:30.234 --> 23:31.758
Turns out there are benefits

23:31.801 --> 23:33.368
to being an accomplice
to adultery.

23:33.412 --> 23:35.936
See? Like I said.

23:35.979 --> 23:38.286
It's all about
confidence.

23:38.329 --> 23:39.940
Although a weapon helps.

23:39.983 --> 23:41.768
But if you don't
have one...

23:43.291 --> 23:44.901
...improvise.

23:46.468 --> 23:48.427
Bingo.

23:56.130 --> 23:58.567
This is how I used to sneak
into my neighbors' houses

23:58.611 --> 23:59.655
to watch your movies.

24:01.701 --> 24:04.225
Danny?

24:06.619 --> 24:09.186
Buddy?

24:09.230 --> 24:12.146
Worst time ever to sober up.

24:13.452 --> 24:16.019
Okay. Left or right?
Left or right?

24:16.063 --> 24:17.412
Calm down.

24:17.456 --> 24:19.414
Like Danny said,

24:19.458 --> 24:21.416
it's all about confidence.

24:21.460 --> 24:22.896
Okay.

24:24.332 --> 24:25.768
Left.

24:26.769 --> 24:28.554
MICHAEL:
Whatever we can do

24:28.597 --> 24:29.903
to expand the team's brand.

24:29.946 --> 24:31.513
If the cameras can follow meto the Atlantix games,

24:31.557 --> 24:33.036
well, that's even better.

24:33.080 --> 24:34.951
LISA:Okay, understood.

24:34.995 --> 24:37.563
This has all been helpful
for us to start drafting

24:37.606 --> 24:39.042
your contracts for season two.

24:39.086 --> 24:40.609
Is that everything?

24:41.654 --> 24:43.046
Not quite.

24:43.090 --> 24:46.267
We need to incorporate more
travel into next season.

24:46.310 --> 24:48.878
I'll want a private
jet on standby.

24:48.922 --> 24:50.880
Also, some new cars
would be nice.

24:50.924 --> 24:52.099
And also

24:52.142 --> 24:54.275
some time off
to pursue other projects.

24:54.318 --> 24:55.755
It's all on the list.

24:58.932 --> 25:01.543
Oh. You're serious about this?

25:01.587 --> 25:04.285
I don't kid around when it comesto getting what I deserve.

25:04.328 --> 25:08.028
Uh, why don't we just hearwhat our generous producers

25:08.071 --> 25:10.204
have to offer,
and then maybe

25:10.247 --> 25:11.988
we can lower your demands
just a little bit.

25:12.032 --> 25:13.294
Lower?

25:13.337 --> 25:15.514
This is just a starting point
for me.

25:17.646 --> 25:19.387
Let me know
when you're ready to talk.

25:25.393 --> 25:28.570
FREDERICK:
The king is out of patience.

25:28.614 --> 25:31.051
He asked for something
new to look at.

25:31.094 --> 25:32.356
I suggested

25:32.400 --> 25:33.880
a human head.

25:48.634 --> 25:50.070
No. Stop.Stop! Stop, stop!Hey! Hold on, now!

25:58.165 --> 25:59.645
Aah!

25:59.688 --> 26:00.776
Dad? Dad!

26:00.820 --> 26:02.691
Dad, what's wrong?

26:02.735 --> 26:03.997
Can you get some help, please?

26:04.040 --> 26:05.215
Get some help!

26:08.131 --> 26:09.176
You all right?

26:09.219 --> 26:10.656
You got to take it easy.

26:10.699 --> 26:12.919
Yeah, I'm fine. I was faking it.Are you even a doctor?

26:12.962 --> 26:14.747
Are you okay?

26:14.790 --> 26:16.575
Yeah, I'm good. I'm fine.Hey, hey, guys,not to be a downer,

26:16.618 --> 26:18.185
but someone's gonna come lookingfor this guy really soon.

26:18.228 --> 26:19.621
All right. I may
have a plan.

26:19.665 --> 26:21.188
'Cause your last one
worked out so well.

26:21.231 --> 26:23.190
Okay, so, we take his keys...

26:23.233 --> 26:24.583
BLAKE: No, we're
not going anywhere.

26:24.626 --> 26:25.932
I don't thinkwe can get through the door.

26:25.975 --> 26:27.455
Whoa, he's getting up.Somebody hit him.

26:27.498 --> 26:28.456
Watch out.

26:28.499 --> 26:30.240
Whoa!Sam?

26:32.678 --> 26:34.201
Damn.

26:34.244 --> 26:35.942
I wish Danny would've seen that.

26:35.985 --> 26:38.161
DANNY:
I saw it, Sam.

26:39.206 --> 26:40.773
I think you're still
a little high.

26:42.252 --> 26:44.254
I'll see you later.

26:46.474 --> 26:49.433
All right, come on. We got
to get back up that vent.

26:49.477 --> 26:50.478
You, Liam. First.

26:50.521 --> 26:52.785
Okay. Yeah.Ready? One, two...

26:52.828 --> 26:54.569
FALLON:
We are not going back in.

26:54.613 --> 26:56.310
Why are you obsessed
with this whole thing?

26:56.353 --> 26:57.964
I'm not obsessed with anything.

26:58.007 --> 27:01.141
Okay. So, you think showing up
to a strange woman's apartment

27:01.184 --> 27:03.317
and kicking her to drop
a lawsuit is normal?

27:03.360 --> 27:04.971
I didn't plan to kick her.

27:05.014 --> 27:06.015
It's just...

27:07.408 --> 27:09.976
This is the first timein a long time

27:10.019 --> 27:11.978
that anyone caresabout what I have to say.

27:12.021 --> 27:14.415
And it feels niceto be validated.

27:14.458 --> 27:15.808
So...

27:15.851 --> 27:18.332
I just don't want that to end.

27:21.640 --> 27:23.859
No, don't sit on
the floor. Don't.

27:23.903 --> 27:25.731
Aw, you did it. Okay.

27:25.774 --> 27:27.602
Listen,

27:27.646 --> 27:30.605
I'm, uh, not sure

27:30.649 --> 27:34.435
you should base your self-worthon callers to a podcast,

27:34.478 --> 27:36.089
but okay.

27:36.132 --> 27:39.396
One of the few nice things aboutbeing married to your father,

27:39.440 --> 27:40.920
if not the only,

27:40.963 --> 27:45.533
was that I wastaken seriously in society.

27:45.576 --> 27:47.535
I know it probably sounds
superficial to you,

27:47.578 --> 27:51.234
but I was respected
and looked up to.

27:51.278 --> 27:53.715
Yes, it does sound superficial.

27:53.759 --> 27:55.195
:Okay.

27:55.238 --> 27:57.458
You know what?Forget it.

27:57.501 --> 27:59.547
You don't understand.

27:59.590 --> 28:01.027
Which is ironic,

28:01.070 --> 28:03.464
because whenever you'regoing after something you want,

28:03.507 --> 28:05.161
you don't carewho gets in your way.

28:05.205 --> 28:07.250
But I dothe same thing, well,

28:07.294 --> 28:08.817
you call me crazy.

28:08.861 --> 28:12.168
Okay, I think we can both agree

28:12.212 --> 28:16.259
that you can be a little,
you know, out there

28:16.303 --> 28:18.740
sometimes, but
I guess I do

28:18.784 --> 28:22.135
lose sight of why you do
the things you do.

28:22.178 --> 28:24.354
We're more alike
than you think, Fallon.

28:24.398 --> 28:27.053
Mmm.

28:27.096 --> 28:29.795
And kicking that womanwas an accident.

28:29.838 --> 28:32.275
But look at that tacky doormat.

28:32.319 --> 28:35.061
She kind of deserved it.

28:35.104 --> 28:36.758
What?

28:37.803 --> 28:39.456
Okay.

28:39.500 --> 28:40.719
Who's next? Let's go.

28:40.762 --> 28:41.981
How are we gonna get
the last one up?

28:43.069 --> 28:44.897
I told you I was
coming to save you.

28:44.940 --> 28:46.899
That's what I'm doing.
Come on. Let's go.

28:46.942 --> 28:48.727
Let's go.

28:58.867 --> 29:00.434
Sam, close it up.

29:00.477 --> 29:02.523
Close it up.

29:04.830 --> 29:06.179
Good luck.

29:15.623 --> 29:17.103
Hi.

29:17.146 --> 29:19.758
Hi, Joyce. We just havea few more questions.

29:19.801 --> 29:21.890
Talk to my lawyers.I don't think you want that.

29:21.934 --> 29:24.110
I don't think you'd want that,
either. You attacked me.

29:24.153 --> 29:26.808
Hmm.Yes. But when you wentto defend yourself,

29:26.852 --> 29:28.810
you, Joyce,used your right arm.

29:28.854 --> 29:30.594
The armyou supposedly broke.

29:30.638 --> 29:32.248
So? It was a reflex.

29:32.292 --> 29:33.684
You can't blame me
for defending myself.

29:33.728 --> 29:34.990
Yes, that's true.

29:35.034 --> 29:36.949
But you didn't seemto be showing much pain

29:36.992 --> 29:38.646
when you were wavingyour arm around.

29:38.689 --> 29:40.169
Plus, there's the doormat.

29:40.213 --> 29:41.997
And she doesn't mean
the tacky message.

29:42.041 --> 29:45.479
It just says "live
wild and free."Well, it's filthy.

29:45.522 --> 29:47.611
And weirdly,the fresh dirt on the mat

29:47.655 --> 29:50.701
matches the dirton your $12 high heel shoes.

29:50.745 --> 29:52.616
ALEXIS:And everybody knowsyou can't wear high heels

29:52.660 --> 29:53.835
with a broken leg.

29:53.879 --> 29:55.271
It's the height of gauche.

29:55.315 --> 29:57.970
You don't know that's from me.FALLON: Well,

29:58.013 --> 30:00.276
I'm pretty sure if I tookthose shoes and I tested them

30:00.320 --> 30:01.843
against the dirt markson that mat,

30:01.887 --> 30:03.497
it would be an exact match.

30:03.540 --> 30:05.629
Look, before we settle

30:05.673 --> 30:08.067
on anything, I am goingto need to see some X-rays.

30:11.070 --> 30:12.375
No? Okay.

30:12.419 --> 30:14.029
Well, I guesswe can just see them

30:14.073 --> 30:15.683
when we countersue youfor damages.

30:16.727 --> 30:18.033
Fine!

30:18.077 --> 30:19.513
You're right.

30:19.556 --> 30:20.819
I made it all up.

30:20.862 --> 30:23.169
I just wanted an easy paycheck.

30:24.387 --> 30:25.475
I will drop the lawsuit.

30:25.519 --> 30:27.129
But you two? Insane.

30:27.173 --> 30:28.696
Mmm. Ah, ah, ah.

30:28.739 --> 30:30.524
And?

30:31.525 --> 30:32.874
Your advice was good.

30:32.918 --> 30:34.354
I can't.

30:34.397 --> 30:37.009
I know. You're welcome.

30:41.056 --> 30:42.884
Must be almost 30 minutes

30:42.928 --> 30:44.712
by now.Well, what if he's...

30:44.755 --> 30:46.148
you know.LIAM:
Just give it

30:46.192 --> 30:47.280
a little more time.

30:47.323 --> 30:48.629
They're not gonnakill Adam, all right?

30:48.672 --> 30:49.891
If they want to get to me,they'll keep him alive.

30:49.935 --> 30:51.719
I'll call in an extraction teamas soon as

30:51.762 --> 30:54.069
we get in the air.No! We are staying

30:54.113 --> 30:55.375
until it is no longer safe.

30:55.418 --> 30:57.203
That could be approximately now.

30:57.246 --> 31:00.597
There's a palace guard
on his way to see us.

31:01.598 --> 31:03.600
Let's go!

31:03.644 --> 31:05.994
Are you insane?It's not a guard.

31:06.038 --> 31:08.040
It's not a guard.

31:12.958 --> 31:15.874
: Let's get
the hell out of here, right?

31:15.917 --> 31:17.788
Hey. Hey, come on. Let's go.

31:21.575 --> 31:22.750
Did they counter yet?

31:22.793 --> 31:24.230
They left.

31:24.273 --> 31:26.928
And they pulled the
plug on the show.

31:26.972 --> 31:29.757
They didn't want to deal with
you or your crazy demands.

31:29.800 --> 31:32.368
This is how negotiations work.Trust me, they'll be back.

31:32.412 --> 31:33.848
I'm pretty sure they won't be,

31:33.892 --> 31:37.330
given the fact that they said,"We won't be back."

31:40.115 --> 31:41.769
Fine.

31:41.812 --> 31:43.423
We'll do bigger things now.

31:43.466 --> 31:44.946
It was alwayssupposed to be

31:44.990 --> 31:46.643
a platformto the next level.

31:46.687 --> 31:49.255
And don't worry, Vanessa,
I'll have my new producer,

31:49.298 --> 31:50.691
Chase, get something
for you, too.

31:50.734 --> 31:51.953
What about me?

31:51.997 --> 31:53.389
I was counting
on a second season.

31:53.433 --> 31:55.174
We can't all be winners,
Michael.

31:55.217 --> 31:56.305
The fact is,

31:56.349 --> 31:57.393
I don't care about soccer.

31:57.437 --> 31:59.308
And I don'treally know

31:59.352 --> 32:00.875
if there's a spot for you
in our plans.

32:00.919 --> 32:03.138
The world of reality
can be tough.

32:04.487 --> 32:05.793
Let's go, Vanessa.

32:08.100 --> 32:09.362
Wow, okay.

32:09.405 --> 32:11.016
Was that really necessary?

32:11.059 --> 32:13.409
He's a weak link who'd
be holding us back.

32:13.453 --> 32:15.237
I've been guiding your
career our entire lives.

32:15.281 --> 32:16.847
I know what I'm doing.

32:24.507 --> 32:26.292
We'll be landing
in a few hours, Cristal.

32:26.335 --> 32:28.947
Everybody is, everybody's safe.

32:28.990 --> 32:31.297
I'd like to propose a toast.

32:31.340 --> 32:33.821
Family, friends, rescuers.

32:33.864 --> 32:36.432
Fallon not finding out
about this.

32:36.476 --> 32:38.782
And thanks to hiring some localarmed escorts in gunboats,

32:38.826 --> 32:41.002
two tankers on their way
to Georgia.

32:41.046 --> 32:44.005
Wait, so you got the oil?

32:44.049 --> 32:46.007
I thought you were in this messbecause you couldn't

32:46.051 --> 32:47.269
negotiate for it.

32:47.313 --> 32:48.488
No, I had the oil
the whole time.

32:48.531 --> 32:49.750
I just couldn't
get the tankers out

32:49.793 --> 32:52.100
of Moldavian waters.
I didn't want to

32:52.144 --> 32:53.841
tell you about it 'cause
I knew you'd try to talk me

32:53.884 --> 32:56.017
into returning the oil
for our freedom.

32:56.061 --> 32:58.106
Right, so I-I sacrificed myself

32:58.150 --> 33:01.153
so you could keep all of the...couple barrels of stolen oil?

33:01.196 --> 33:03.677
It was over 150 million gallons.

33:03.720 --> 33:05.548
And it was mineto begin with.

33:05.592 --> 33:07.202
Do you have any idea
how much money that is?

33:07.246 --> 33:10.597
Do you have any idea
what we've been through?

33:10.640 --> 33:11.772
What I've
been through?

33:11.815 --> 33:13.687
I dropped everything
to come save you.

33:13.730 --> 33:16.037
I risked my life,

33:16.081 --> 33:17.517
because you're my father.

33:17.560 --> 33:19.693
Even though you,
you continued to berate me.

33:19.736 --> 33:22.522
And now I find out that this
could've all ended yesterday

33:22.565 --> 33:24.741
if you weren't
so damn greedy?

33:24.785 --> 33:26.439
Hey, hey, Adam?No, we're done.

33:34.229 --> 33:35.796
Evan?

33:35.839 --> 33:37.537
What's going on?What's wrong?Hey.

33:37.580 --> 33:39.060
You, uh, texted me something
about killing your mother

33:39.104 --> 33:40.540
and then I never heard back.

33:40.583 --> 33:43.369
Sorry, I totally
forgot about you.

33:43.412 --> 33:44.805
No, everythingis fine.

33:44.848 --> 33:47.068
Nobody got hurt,
not even Joyce Doyle.

33:47.112 --> 33:49.375
Well, I mean, she did getkicked in the stomach,

33:49.418 --> 33:51.072
but as far as car accidents go,

33:51.116 --> 33:52.726
she was faking her injuries.

33:52.769 --> 33:54.728
What?Yeah.

33:54.771 --> 33:56.295
So the case is now closed.

33:56.338 --> 33:58.993
You are free to goback and work for

33:59.037 --> 34:01.909
the poor or disenfranchised
or whatever it is that you do.

34:01.952 --> 34:04.912
But, uh, we should
still celebrate, right?

34:04.955 --> 34:06.914
I mean, we never
did get our lunch

34:06.957 --> 34:08.394
and, uh, I'm
free for dinner

34:08.437 --> 34:09.699
or drinks,
you know,

34:09.743 --> 34:11.049
whatever works best.

34:11.092 --> 34:13.181
I just want to see you again.

34:13.225 --> 34:15.096
Evan...

34:15.140 --> 34:17.446
I'm sorry, but...

34:17.490 --> 34:18.578
I am getting married

34:18.621 --> 34:20.623
to the man I love,Liam.

34:20.667 --> 34:22.451
And there's no one elseI want to be with.

34:22.495 --> 34:24.105
And I don't wantto lead you on.

34:24.149 --> 34:25.715
So I think it's best

34:25.759 --> 34:27.108
that we don't go out...

34:28.892 --> 34:30.590
...or see each other anymore.

34:30.633 --> 34:31.982
Okay?

34:32.026 --> 34:34.507
No, no, I get it.

34:34.550 --> 34:35.986
Have a good wedding.

34:36.030 --> 34:38.032
Thanks.

34:50.523 --> 34:52.220
Hey, it's me.

34:52.264 --> 34:54.179
What the hell is wrong with you?

34:54.222 --> 34:56.355
Well, I don't care if they
dropped by unannounced, Joyce.

34:56.398 --> 34:57.660
You were supposed to improvise!

34:58.661 --> 35:00.054
Well, yes, the deal is off.

35:00.098 --> 35:01.273
If I don't get to be her hero,

35:01.316 --> 35:03.362
then you don't get a dime.

35:10.282 --> 35:11.500
What now?

35:11.544 --> 35:12.806
I've already
called Meghan Markle's cousin

35:12.849 --> 35:14.155
and asked her to co-host,

35:14.199 --> 35:15.417
so you can't cancel the show.

35:15.461 --> 35:17.637
I'm not-- I came here

35:17.680 --> 35:19.769
to tell you that
you were right about Evan.

35:19.813 --> 35:21.467
He did have feelings for me.

35:21.510 --> 35:22.816
Hmm.

35:22.859 --> 35:24.339
I guess I do tend

35:24.383 --> 35:26.602
to question
your advice because...

35:26.646 --> 35:28.648
you were never around to give meany when I was younger.

35:28.691 --> 35:31.477
Classic defense mechanism.

35:31.520 --> 35:33.609
I did a show about that
three days ago.

35:33.653 --> 35:34.697
Yeah.

35:34.741 --> 35:36.177
Look...

35:36.221 --> 35:39.049
I'm sorry that
I've always seen you

35:39.093 --> 35:40.834
as a manipulative shrew.

35:40.877 --> 35:42.314
But I'm gonna try
to change that.

35:42.357 --> 35:43.837
Okay, I'm gonna try to see you

35:43.880 --> 35:47.319
as someone with...
goals and wants and...

35:47.362 --> 35:50.148
all that regular crap
that real people have.

35:50.191 --> 35:52.802
A three-dimensional
manipulative shrew?

35:52.846 --> 35:55.153
Exactly.

35:55.196 --> 35:57.329
You know, I always thought thatI got my tenacity from Blake,

35:57.372 --> 35:59.853
but now I'm starting
to think I got it from you.

35:59.896 --> 36:01.507
Which is why

36:01.550 --> 36:03.335
I have decided I am not gonna

36:03.378 --> 36:04.553
stand in your way

36:04.597 --> 36:05.815
any longer.

36:05.859 --> 36:07.165
Aw!

36:07.208 --> 36:09.254
Your censor button.

36:09.297 --> 36:11.604
Does this mean I have carteblanche to say whatever I want?

36:11.647 --> 36:14.563
Well, it was really more
symbolic than anything else,

36:14.607 --> 36:15.564
so...

36:15.608 --> 36:17.479
I'm gonna say whatever I want.

36:17.523 --> 36:20.265
VANESSA:This is his office?

36:23.964 --> 36:26.140
DOMINIQUE:What the hell?

36:26.184 --> 36:27.794
Oh.

36:27.837 --> 36:30.057
Hi, guys.

36:31.667 --> 36:33.234
Chase Cartof's office.

36:33.278 --> 36:34.583
How can I
help you?

36:34.627 --> 36:36.890
Oh. It's for you.

36:36.933 --> 36:38.500
I'll just, uh,
put it on speaker.

36:39.545 --> 36:40.502
There you go.

36:40.546 --> 36:41.938
Hello?

36:41.982 --> 36:44.506
Dominique, Michael Culhane here.

36:44.550 --> 36:46.726
You know, the guy youscrewed over for the last time.

36:46.769 --> 36:48.554
What's going
on here?

36:48.597 --> 36:50.251
I don't have time for this.

36:50.295 --> 36:53.036
: Well,you ain't got nothing but time.

36:53.080 --> 36:54.690
You have no House of Deveraux.

36:54.734 --> 36:56.126
And, surprise,

36:56.170 --> 36:58.477
Chase Cartof doesn't exist.

36:58.520 --> 37:03.221
Did you really think that
you could be the next Oprah?

37:03.264 --> 37:04.352
Oh, geez.

37:04.396 --> 37:06.093
And, Vanessa,

37:06.136 --> 37:08.922
this is what you get for alwaysdoing what your mother says.

37:08.965 --> 37:10.489
Let me be clear.

37:10.532 --> 37:12.926
We are done.

37:12.969 --> 37:16.277
I wish I could see the looks
on your faces right about now.

37:16.321 --> 37:18.801
Oh, wait.I can.

37:19.802 --> 37:21.021
Would you lookat that?

37:21.064 --> 37:24.764
Better than I thought.

37:24.807 --> 37:25.939
Told you.

37:25.982 --> 37:27.114
You were right.

37:27.157 --> 37:28.985
This was amazing.

37:36.471 --> 37:38.473
You're fired.

37:41.650 --> 37:43.435
Whoa.

37:43.478 --> 37:44.914
Feeling okay?I will,

37:44.958 --> 37:46.612
after I spend
the next five days in bed.

37:46.655 --> 37:48.309
But what about
the 30 Under 30 thing?

37:48.353 --> 37:49.789
Don't you haveto do that?

37:49.832 --> 37:51.965
Can you please take this
to my room? Thank you.

37:52.008 --> 37:53.619
I already told you,

37:53.662 --> 37:56.404
I'm not in a good place
to give uplifting speeches.

37:56.448 --> 37:57.971
Are you joking?

37:58.014 --> 38:00.278
Sam, you're the reason
we're alive.

38:01.279 --> 38:03.324
You're a hero.No, I'm not.

38:03.368 --> 38:04.456
Danny Trejo is.

38:04.499 --> 38:05.979
And, yes, I know
he wasn't real,

38:06.022 --> 38:08.155
but he guided me through it all.

38:08.198 --> 38:09.635
Okay? If I had been
in my right mind,

38:09.678 --> 38:11.463
then I'd still be in that plane

38:11.506 --> 38:13.203
and you'd still be in prison.Sam,

38:13.247 --> 38:15.467
I don't care
how many fake people helped.

38:15.510 --> 38:17.164
That was all you.

38:17.207 --> 38:18.426
Just like La Mirage.

38:18.470 --> 38:20.080
Sure, maybe somebody elsegave you the money,

38:20.123 --> 38:22.125
but, Sam, you made it a success.

38:23.866 --> 38:25.346
So stop selling yourself short.

38:25.390 --> 38:27.174
You know what?

38:27.217 --> 38:29.002
You're right.

38:29.045 --> 38:30.046
I am a hero.

38:30.090 --> 38:32.048
So, look out,
30 Under 30.

38:32.092 --> 38:33.528
Because I may have
lied about my age,

38:33.572 --> 38:35.095
but I'm coming for you.

38:35.138 --> 38:39.839
And I just rescued Blake and
Liam from a Moldavian prison,

38:39.882 --> 38:42.537
so, uh, I got some
things to say.
