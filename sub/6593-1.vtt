02:51.240 --> 02:52.605
Mario!

02:53.240 --> 02:54.765
Hey, Mario! Hey, hey!

02:59.440 --> 03:01.329
Great party, Mario.

03:10.800 --> 03:12.484
Lobos! Pass me the ball!

03:12.960 --> 03:14.644
Okay, Escarlette, Escarlette!

03:14.960 --> 03:16.246
Right here, on the left! Come on!

03:16.440 --> 03:19.131
Lobos, over here! Over here, over here!

03:19.960 --> 03:20.961
Yeah!

03:21.160 --> 03:22.286
Well done, Escarlette!

03:23.640 --> 03:26.405
That's my baby, that's my baby.

03:33.960 --> 03:35.041
Mario!

03:35.600 --> 03:38.206
I love your bottom, Katty.

03:38.480 --> 03:39.641
Did I ever tell you that?

03:39.800 --> 03:42.326
You have the best bottom in Copiapó.

03:42.480 --> 03:43.811
You're crazy!

03:43.960 --> 03:45.644
- Hey, Mario.
- Hey, Manuel.

03:52.240 --> 03:53.651
Come on, Copiapó!

03:58.160 --> 03:59.321
Lucho.

04:00.960 --> 04:03.770
Tomorrow is my free day, but...

04:04.960 --> 04:06.325
I would like to work.

04:06.480 --> 04:09.689
- I'm kind of short of money.
- Tomorrow?

04:09.920 --> 04:12.844
I know there is a lot of people
asking you for the same thing, but...

04:14.920 --> 04:15.967
You got it.

04:16.680 --> 04:18.841
That's it? You're not going
to fight me or anything?

04:19.000 --> 04:20.843
I'm not going to fight you.

04:25.600 --> 04:27.489
Thank you very much, Copiapó!

04:28.160 --> 04:29.446
Hola, Jessi.

04:29.640 --> 04:30.846
Hello, Don Jose.

04:32.280 --> 04:34.681
Álex, I found a job for you.

04:34.960 --> 04:37.611
Rodrigo's going to be looking
for some help in the body shop.

04:37.800 --> 04:40.963
We talked about this last time.
What's he going to pay, Dad?

04:41.520 --> 04:42.521
50 a week?

04:42.800 --> 04:44.529
You love birds get the sonogram yet?

04:44.800 --> 04:46.325
- It's a boy.
- It's a girl.

04:46.720 --> 04:48.722
- It's a boy.
- It's a girl.

04:49.320 --> 04:51.049
- It's a boy.
- It's a girl.

04:51.280 --> 04:52.884
It's a boy. It's a boy.

04:53.280 --> 04:54.645
Álex, talk to him.

04:54.840 --> 04:55.887
Okay.

04:57.640 --> 04:59.529
Rodrigo, how are you, man?

05:00.480 --> 05:02.005
- You talked to your old man?
- Yeah.

05:02.200 --> 05:04.043
- How much you going to pay?
- 50 a week.

05:04.360 --> 05:06.328
- 50 a week.
- You're going to have a baby.

05:06.520 --> 05:08.249
Get your ass out of that mine.

05:13.880 --> 05:15.530
Someone fill this old man's glass.

05:16.160 --> 05:17.400
Mario Gómez!

05:17.720 --> 05:21.725
Congratulations on your retirement.
45 years a miner.

05:22.240 --> 05:24.242
- The bravest man I ever met.
- Gómez!

05:24.520 --> 05:26.761
- 46!
- 46.

05:31.720 --> 05:33.085
Empanadas!

05:34.720 --> 05:36.768
Cheese, chicken, pino meat!

05:38.080 --> 05:39.605
Empanadas!

05:40.440 --> 05:42.249
Cheese, chicken, pino meat!

05:42.440 --> 05:45.205
- Good morning, María.
- Empanadas!

06:15.600 --> 06:16.806
Darío.

06:19.800 --> 06:22.280
I know you're not sleeping,
little brother.

06:26.800 --> 06:30.725
I don't care if you don't eat them.
I'll always be here.

06:33.720 --> 06:35.131
They're still warm.

06:37.320 --> 06:39.641
Cheese, chicken, pino meat!

06:40.280 --> 06:41.770
Empanadas!

07:11.320 --> 07:12.970
Yonni, the bus is here!

07:13.360 --> 07:16.206
What's she doing here, Yonni?
You live with me now.

07:16.440 --> 07:18.204
I'm his wife, you bitch.

07:18.360 --> 07:21.045
- Why do you do this to yourself?
- I made your breakfast.

07:21.200 --> 07:22.361
- I know.
- You made him breakfast?

07:22.520 --> 07:24.522
She made breakfast, that's what she does.

07:27.280 --> 07:28.520
Marta, I didn't say I didn't want it.

07:28.800 --> 07:30.211
Guys, guys!

07:30.360 --> 07:33.842
Here comes Don Giovanni.
Check this out. All right.

07:34.520 --> 07:36.363
We have to find a solution to this.

07:36.520 --> 07:38.045
Oh!

07:38.280 --> 07:40.886
Okay, okay!

07:42.160 --> 07:43.571
- Ándale.
- Okay!

07:47.040 --> 07:48.405
Hey, Mario.

07:49.120 --> 07:52.203
You couldn't find a mistress
who lives on the other side of town?

07:52.400 --> 07:54.164
Admit it, you're jealous.

07:54.360 --> 07:56.567
Uh... Believe me, I am not.

07:57.400 --> 07:58.526
Nah.

07:59.680 --> 08:01.170
I love you!

08:38.760 --> 08:40.842
Not dead yet, Segovia?

08:41.080 --> 08:42.605
Not yet, Pastor.

08:42.840 --> 08:44.126
Getting there.

08:49.200 --> 08:50.531
Bolivian!

08:52.560 --> 08:55.291
Loser!

09:29.720 --> 09:31.404
I found this on level three.

09:31.720 --> 09:32.846
So?

09:34.480 --> 09:37.324
We put these mirrors in the cracks
so we know when the mountain shifts.

09:37.560 --> 09:39.324
She's an old mine.

09:40.640 --> 09:42.847
The mountain is going to shift.

09:43.480 --> 09:45.687
The mirrors are going to break.

09:45.920 --> 09:48.127
I think we should get
a health check on the ramp.

09:48.320 --> 09:50.163
- We may be looking at...
- The ramp is a good rock.

09:50.440 --> 09:52.488
The mine's got another
20 years left in her.

09:52.680 --> 09:56.446
We may be looking at a weakness
in the mountain's internal structure.

09:57.360 --> 09:58.361
Marco.

09:58.640 --> 10:01.450
It's my job to keep these men safe.

10:03.000 --> 10:04.161
Correction.

10:04.480 --> 10:05.766
Your job, Lucho,

10:06.000 --> 10:10.050
is to keep these men
pulling out 250 tons a day.

10:10.280 --> 10:11.361
250?

10:11.600 --> 10:13.682
Your quota has gone up.

10:17.800 --> 10:20.963
There's only so much gold in the mountain.

10:25.320 --> 10:26.367
Darío.

10:32.680 --> 10:35.524
All right, guys, we're working
rock bottom today.

10:36.360 --> 10:38.328
Where is Carlos Mamani?

10:39.520 --> 10:41.045
- Here.
- Everyone!

10:41.800 --> 10:44.246
Say hello to Mamani,
our new boy from Bolivia.

10:44.640 --> 10:46.244
He's a tin digger.

10:46.640 --> 10:50.929
What does a tin digger from Bolivia
know about mining for gold?

10:51.560 --> 10:53.164
Elvis, not today, huh?

10:53.360 --> 10:54.930
I got him.

10:56.680 --> 10:58.409
Retirement papers, Gómez!

10:58.560 --> 11:00.403
Two weeks, and you're a free man!

11:00.560 --> 11:01.925
Sign them and get them back to me.

11:02.160 --> 11:03.571
Bravo, Gómez!

11:03.840 --> 11:04.921
Lobos, let's go!

11:46.040 --> 11:47.769
Is that the only way in?

11:48.760 --> 11:51.001
The only way in, the only way out.

12:37.560 --> 12:40.928
You know Elvis didn't
write his own lyrics, right?

12:41.120 --> 12:42.849
That's blasphemy.

12:43.800 --> 12:45.848
Next you're going to tell me
he didn't do his own dancing.

12:57.720 --> 12:59.085
How much longer?

12:59.280 --> 13:00.725
About an hour.

13:30.200 --> 13:32.771
- Whoa.
- Easy, Lobos.

13:33.200 --> 13:35.521
Okay, huevónes. You know what to do.

13:42.000 --> 13:43.843
You should get it together. Darío.

13:44.040 --> 13:45.371
Yonni, what's that?

13:46.640 --> 13:48.768
Bolivia! Hey, Bolivia!

13:48.960 --> 13:51.930
- Kananni, Kachani... What's your name?
- Mamani.

13:52.120 --> 13:53.849
Whatever, come over here.

13:56.000 --> 13:58.571
I know, I know. That's crazy Elvis.

13:58.720 --> 14:00.609
He's just always looking for trouble.

14:01.560 --> 14:03.369
He actually thinks he's Elvis.

14:58.200 --> 15:01.044
Rodrigo has offered me
a job in his body shop.

15:02.360 --> 15:05.204
50 a week. What do you think about that?

15:05.520 --> 15:07.921
50 a week? That's a joke, right?

15:08.120 --> 15:10.043
And you're going to be a father?

15:10.560 --> 15:11.971
That's the problem.

15:12.640 --> 15:13.880
You know what?

15:14.440 --> 15:16.169
You're asking the wrong man.

15:16.360 --> 15:18.567
And I have a terrible hangover.

15:19.360 --> 15:23.281
I don't know, it's the same thing
over and over with my dad.

15:25.040 --> 15:26.405
What was that?

15:34.160 --> 15:35.400
This is why we're here.

15:36.160 --> 15:38.049
Yeah, I can taste it.

15:38.400 --> 15:40.607
Copper and gold. 1,200 an ounce.

15:40.800 --> 15:43.246
Take it. Take it. Yeah.

15:44.000 --> 15:46.367
Cholo, you going to stick that
in your pocket for your mamá?

15:46.560 --> 15:47.607
What did you say?

15:48.240 --> 15:51.130
Everyone knows that Bolivians
are a bunch of thieves.

15:51.400 --> 15:52.925
He's stupid, you know that?

15:54.080 --> 15:55.730
Chile stole this land.

15:55.920 --> 15:58.287
After the War of 1881.

15:58.920 --> 16:00.445
Who are the thieves?

16:00.680 --> 16:03.365
That was... 1881, you know?

16:06.520 --> 16:09.126
Run now! Run!

16:21.800 --> 16:22.961
What the hell?

16:39.840 --> 16:41.649
Oh!

16:46.320 --> 16:47.401
Darío!

16:50.040 --> 16:51.485
Álex, pull me up!

16:51.680 --> 16:54.729
Pull me up! Álex, don't let me fall!

16:55.720 --> 16:58.769
- Álex, don't let me fall! Pull me up!
- Hang on, Darío.

16:58.960 --> 17:01.247
Collapse! Collapse!

17:01.480 --> 17:02.811
Lobos! The carrier!

17:03.040 --> 17:04.165
Gómez, come on!

17:04.800 --> 17:06.369
Get on, get on!

17:06.560 --> 17:08.085
Hurry up! Let's go!

17:13.000 --> 17:14.843
Come on, man!

17:15.720 --> 17:17.324
Darío! Climb, Darío!

17:22.480 --> 17:23.560
Run!

17:24.200 --> 17:25.247
Go!

17:25.839 --> 17:27.079
Move it, move it!

17:28.079 --> 17:30.481
Out! Out! Let's go, everyone!

17:30.680 --> 17:32.125
Come on, Henríquez, let's go!

17:34.360 --> 17:36.601
- Come on!
- Get on! Get on!

17:39.200 --> 17:40.690
Come on, get up!

17:42.240 --> 17:43.571
Everyone hold on!

17:46.120 --> 17:47.849
Lobos! Come on, let's go!

17:48.520 --> 17:49.567
Come on, come on!

17:49.760 --> 17:51.683
- Go up!
- No, don't go up!

17:51.920 --> 17:54.321
No, it's coming from above!
Head down to the refuge!

17:54.520 --> 17:55.567
Head down!

18:08.880 --> 18:10.689
Head to the pick-up!

18:12.880 --> 18:15.724
Hey! Wait for us! Yonni!

18:15.920 --> 18:17.888
- Come on!
- Hurry! Let's go!

18:18.080 --> 18:20.003
- Everyone in?
- Start it!

18:20.240 --> 18:21.480
Up, up, let's go up!

18:22.920 --> 18:25.082
Drive! Out, out, out!

18:36.000 --> 18:37.809
Run, come on!

18:38.000 --> 18:39.081
Go!

18:39.600 --> 18:41.364
- Wait! Lucho!
- Hold on!

18:41.560 --> 18:42.641
Hey!

18:42.840 --> 18:45.320
Lobos! Slow down, slow down!

18:45.560 --> 18:46.607
- Mario!
- Lucho!

18:46.800 --> 18:48.370
Mario, get on!

18:48.600 --> 18:50.250
- Help him up!
- Mario, go!

18:50.640 --> 18:52.529
Get on, Elvis!

18:54.000 --> 18:55.570
Bolivian!

18:55.760 --> 18:57.125
They're in! Go, go!

18:57.360 --> 18:58.521
Come on, man!

18:59.600 --> 19:00.726
The Bolivian fell down!

19:00.920 --> 19:02.490
- Stop!
- Lobos, stop!

19:02.680 --> 19:04.842
Lucho! Stop! Stop!

19:05.480 --> 19:06.686
What is that?

19:08.440 --> 19:09.771
Bolivian, come on!

19:12.520 --> 19:14.443
- Come on!
- Mario!

19:15.320 --> 19:17.448
Come on! Run, run, run!

19:20.280 --> 19:21.691
Come on! Run, damn it!

19:23.800 --> 19:24.881
I got you!

19:30.320 --> 19:31.367
Oh, shit.

19:36.120 --> 19:37.406
Go!

19:38.120 --> 19:39.485
Go!

19:51.400 --> 19:52.970
Are we past it?

19:53.360 --> 19:54.407
I hope so.

19:55.640 --> 19:57.847
It's okay. It's okay.

19:58.360 --> 20:00.249
We're going to be okay, guys.

20:11.840 --> 20:13.285
Go back! It's coming from above!

20:13.520 --> 20:15.841
- The wrong way!
- Go to the refuge! Head down!

20:16.040 --> 20:17.690
Yonni! Turn around!

20:20.360 --> 20:21.521
Look out!

20:30.400 --> 20:32.641
Stop! Stop!

20:33.720 --> 20:34.846
No, no!

20:36.040 --> 20:37.246
Go, go, go!

20:50.880 --> 20:51.927
Oh, God!

22:04.680 --> 22:05.761
Gómez.

22:08.440 --> 22:10.966
Gómez!

22:12.480 --> 22:13.561
Álex!

22:16.080 --> 22:17.206
Álex!

22:17.640 --> 22:18.971
You all right?

22:19.480 --> 22:21.926
Come here. Help me out. Quick.

22:23.320 --> 22:24.651
Stay with him.

22:30.320 --> 22:32.243
- You okay, Gómez?
- Yeah.

22:34.000 --> 22:35.490
- Let's get you up.
- Pastor?

22:35.680 --> 22:37.569
Where's the pastor?

22:38.440 --> 22:39.566
Henríquez.

22:40.800 --> 22:41.881
Okay.

22:42.440 --> 22:43.851
Pull!

22:53.400 --> 22:54.811
Elvis.

22:55.000 --> 22:56.650
You okay, man?

23:05.960 --> 23:07.450
Guys.

23:08.760 --> 23:10.285
You have to see this.

23:58.120 --> 23:59.451
Oh, my God.

24:08.960 --> 24:10.644
That's a big rock.

24:12.200 --> 24:14.123
That's not a rock.

24:15.640 --> 24:18.041
That's the heart of the mountain.

24:18.600 --> 24:20.329
She finally broke.

24:24.600 --> 24:25.806
Yes, sir.

24:26.320 --> 24:27.401
Yes.

24:28.240 --> 24:31.130
I got my people checking it out now, yes.

24:31.680 --> 24:33.045
We'll keep it contained.

24:33.280 --> 24:35.009
I'll make sure no one leaves.

24:39.200 --> 24:41.407
Come on! Let's go!

24:44.200 --> 24:46.885
Hey, José, there's been
a collapse in the mine.

24:47.600 --> 24:48.931
They're locking us down.

24:49.120 --> 24:50.645
I'm calling the news.

24:53.120 --> 24:54.167
Nobody out!

24:54.560 --> 24:56.085
Wait, Don José!

24:56.280 --> 24:58.123
Stay here. I'll call you later.

24:58.320 --> 25:00.243
No! I'm coming with you! No!

25:06.480 --> 25:07.641
Hello?

25:12.560 --> 25:13.721
What?

25:14.640 --> 25:17.610
A serious accident just occurred
at the San Jose Mine

25:17.840 --> 25:19.842
40 minutes outside Copiapó.

25:20.160 --> 25:23.448
The number of miners trapped inside
has yet to be determined,

25:23.640 --> 25:27.690
but the company estimates that
30 men were working below.

25:28.640 --> 25:30.210
29...

25:31.320 --> 25:32.481
30...

25:33.360 --> 25:36.284
31, 32...

25:37.600 --> 25:38.806
33.

25:42.240 --> 25:44.163
We're all here.

25:45.840 --> 25:47.842
I thank God for that.

25:51.800 --> 25:54.201
The refuge is built for 30.

25:56.760 --> 25:58.205
So... We're okay.

26:01.120 --> 26:02.167
What do you mean?

26:03.000 --> 26:04.809
What do you mean "we're okay"?

26:05.240 --> 26:07.720
The ramp is blocked, Mario.

26:08.360 --> 26:10.727
There's no road. We have no way out.

26:11.120 --> 26:12.929
What about the chimneys?

26:13.240 --> 26:15.811
- There's ladders there.
- Too dangerous.

26:18.600 --> 26:22.641
I am not ready to sit down there
in the refuge and wait for help.

26:22.840 --> 26:23.887
Mario.

26:24.440 --> 26:26.602
My job is simple.

26:27.560 --> 26:30.962
I have a duty to the safety of these men.

26:31.800 --> 26:36.488
At this moment,
the refuge is the safest place.

26:38.040 --> 26:39.769
There's a radio.

26:40.560 --> 26:42.050
There's food.

26:42.640 --> 26:45.450
Some of these guys need patching up.

26:51.040 --> 26:52.724
You know me, Lucho.

26:54.000 --> 26:56.890
There is no way out
until there is no way out.

26:59.040 --> 27:01.486
I'm going to check out those ladders.

27:02.440 --> 27:04.807
Don Luis. Excuse me.

27:09.000 --> 27:10.206
I'm coming with you.

27:10.560 --> 27:12.324
All right, come on. Bolivian!

27:13.240 --> 27:15.322
We should make a lot of noise.

27:15.680 --> 27:17.569
Burn tires, bang on pipes.

27:18.480 --> 27:20.926
Make a big racket. You never know.

27:31.960 --> 27:33.928
What are they doing?

27:34.080 --> 27:35.730
We have to wait.

27:36.640 --> 27:37.926
It's okay.

27:43.800 --> 27:45.245
Hey, talk to us!

27:45.400 --> 27:47.004
Five hours we've been here!

27:47.240 --> 27:48.401
We told you already.

27:48.600 --> 27:51.251
The company has the situation
under control.

27:51.520 --> 27:52.760
Get Castillo here!

27:52.960 --> 27:54.086
Get off your bony ass...

27:54.240 --> 27:56.527
Okay! Everybody, shut up!

27:56.840 --> 27:58.365
Or I'll have you removed!

27:59.840 --> 28:03.287
Now, go home and wait to be contacted!

28:09.120 --> 28:10.326
Who threw that?

28:10.520 --> 28:11.760
I did.

28:12.000 --> 28:14.321
What are you going to do? Shoot me?

28:14.600 --> 28:15.681
Get off the property!

28:15.960 --> 28:18.691
And you, too! All of you! Go!

28:20.320 --> 28:21.446
Get out of here!

28:22.280 --> 28:23.520
Go home!

28:24.840 --> 28:25.966
Come on!

28:26.680 --> 28:29.365
Let's go. Let's go. Come on.

28:30.440 --> 28:33.171
Hey, where are you all going? Come back.

28:33.480 --> 28:34.686
No, please.

28:34.880 --> 28:36.962
We have to stand our ground.
We have to stay put.

28:37.120 --> 28:39.122
What do you want us to do, María?

28:39.320 --> 28:41.641
They have not told us anything!

28:41.800 --> 28:43.882
That's because they're hiding something.

28:44.320 --> 28:45.685
And there's a reason for that!

28:45.880 --> 28:48.963
We have to stand our ground.
We have to stay put.

28:49.200 --> 28:50.964
Where are the rescue teams?

28:51.640 --> 28:52.687
Huh?

28:54.040 --> 28:56.202
Where are the rescue teams?

28:56.400 --> 28:58.323
Where are the drills?

28:58.640 --> 29:01.484
Why isn't anybody doing anything?

29:01.920 --> 29:04.082
My brother is down there!

29:04.320 --> 29:06.049
We're not going anywhere.

29:06.240 --> 29:07.571
We have to stay here.

29:07.840 --> 29:09.251
- She's right!
- We want to stay!

29:09.480 --> 29:11.687
Hey! Put that down! Put that down!

29:12.000 --> 29:14.082
- Get used to it!
- Stop that!

29:17.680 --> 29:19.682
We're not going anywhere!

29:26.000 --> 29:28.407
- This is a private mine?
- Yes, sir.

29:28.600 --> 29:31.285
Bohn and Kemeny. Chilean nationals.

29:31.760 --> 29:34.525
Thirty-three men trapped underground.

29:35.040 --> 29:37.520
And we don't even know if they're alive?

29:37.760 --> 29:40.366
The responsibility rests
with Bohn and Kemeny.

29:40.600 --> 29:42.921
The government has no obligation
to take a position.

29:43.200 --> 29:45.885
We should have no position on this.

29:46.120 --> 29:48.361
- What are they doing about it?
- Nothing.

29:48.520 --> 29:50.761
They don't have the capability.

29:51.360 --> 29:52.964
I think the government
should show its face.

29:54.120 --> 29:56.043
I'd like to go up there
and take a look at it, sir.

29:56.200 --> 29:58.202
You've never set foot in a mine, Laurence.

29:58.360 --> 30:00.727
What makes you think
you can make any difference?

30:00.880 --> 30:03.121
You've been in the job for what?
Four months.

30:03.400 --> 30:06.609
If we don't react, if we bury our heads,
we look like we don't care.

30:06.800 --> 30:09.644
That's bad for the industry
and that's bad for Chile.

30:11.600 --> 30:13.170
With all due respect, sir,
it's not about us.

30:13.400 --> 30:15.721
I believe we have a moral responsibility.

30:17.080 --> 30:19.401
Thirty-three lives is
a lot of dead people.

30:27.080 --> 30:28.161
Keep going.

30:31.760 --> 30:32.761
Stop!

30:36.600 --> 30:37.761
Come on, Álex.

30:45.080 --> 30:47.082
Someone has to hear.

30:47.280 --> 30:50.284
Lobos. You're wasting your time.

30:55.280 --> 30:57.282
No one is going to hear us.

30:57.920 --> 31:00.287
No one is going to help us.

31:06.120 --> 31:08.282
Hello, this is Luis Urzúa.

31:11.440 --> 31:12.965
I'll check first aid.

31:13.120 --> 31:16.010
Hello, this is Luis Urzúa.
Can you hear me?

31:16.200 --> 31:18.806
Hello, this is Luis Urzúa.
Can you hear me?

32:09.160 --> 32:10.525
Oh, shit.

32:12.000 --> 32:13.365
What?

32:13.840 --> 32:15.922
There's no more ladder.

32:19.120 --> 32:21.282
What do you mean "there's no more ladder"?

32:21.520 --> 32:23.522
I'm telling you, it's not here.

32:37.200 --> 32:38.361
No, no.

32:39.040 --> 32:40.883
No. No.

32:46.720 --> 32:47.801
Moving on.

32:48.880 --> 32:50.041
Álex.

32:51.880 --> 32:53.041
Let's go back.

32:53.760 --> 32:54.807
Okay.

32:55.560 --> 32:56.561
Okay.

33:00.920 --> 33:02.126
Damn it.

33:13.240 --> 33:15.004
No! Álex!

33:17.560 --> 33:18.641
Hold on!

33:19.440 --> 33:20.680
I can't hold on!

33:20.920 --> 33:22.001
- Mario!
- Hold on!

33:22.640 --> 33:25.007
Our Father, who art in Heaven...

33:26.320 --> 33:28.243
Lord Jesus Christ...

33:29.280 --> 33:30.930
You, who are the son of our Creator...

33:32.840 --> 33:37.164
We ask you to grant us
strength and fortitude

33:38.080 --> 33:39.206
in our tribulation.

33:41.920 --> 33:43.604
We ask you today

33:45.200 --> 33:47.282
to protect our families.

33:53.960 --> 33:55.644
It's the government. Hurry up.

34:09.840 --> 34:11.080
Can you please let me through?

34:11.239 --> 34:12.321
We want answers.

34:12.480 --> 34:13.686
That's why I'm here, madam.

34:13.960 --> 34:16.440
But I can't give you answers
unless you let me in.

34:16.639 --> 34:17.801
Or I can have them remove you.

34:17.960 --> 34:19.485
Go ahead and try it.

34:20.159 --> 34:22.766
If you want a little riot on TV tonight.

34:22.960 --> 34:24.324
You're from the government, right?

34:24.520 --> 34:26.123
Laurence Golborne. Minister of Mining.

34:26.320 --> 34:28.288
There are a lot of unhappy
people out here, Laurence.

34:28.800 --> 34:31.201
It's been two days,
and no one has told us anything!

34:31.440 --> 34:33.123
We all know how this goes.

34:33.320 --> 34:34.969
The government shows up,

34:35.159 --> 34:38.208
some good-looking guy in a suit
tells us how much they care.

34:38.520 --> 34:42.005
How much they're going to stop at nothing
to save them, and they do nothing!

34:42.159 --> 34:44.447
We're not going to stand for it, Laurence.

34:44.679 --> 34:47.684
I want you to promise me
you'll do something.

34:48.320 --> 34:51.483
I can promise you we're going
to do everything we can.

34:53.840 --> 34:54.887
Okay?

34:56.679 --> 34:57.966
Okay, go ahead.

34:58.160 --> 35:00.527
- Move, let them through.
- Thank you.

35:00.720 --> 35:02.165
We want answers!

35:02.360 --> 35:04.010
We want answers!

35:04.240 --> 35:05.480
We want answers!

35:05.680 --> 35:07.648
Let's say they are alive.

35:07.840 --> 35:09.171
How long do they have?

35:09.360 --> 35:13.047
Assuming they're alive
and they make it to the refuge,

35:13.240 --> 35:17.086
there's enough food and water
for three days.

35:17.640 --> 35:19.529
And what attempts have been
made to reach them?

35:20.880 --> 35:23.042
I sent a crew of my men down.

35:24.760 --> 35:26.888
A couple of them were almost killed.

35:29.000 --> 35:31.731
So what can we do next, Mr. Castillo?

35:31.920 --> 35:33.206
Nothing.

35:35.360 --> 35:37.886
Well, what's protocol, then?

35:38.080 --> 35:39.445
Protocol?

35:42.680 --> 35:44.682
This mountain is still moving.

35:45.240 --> 35:47.083
I've been a miner for 25 years!

35:47.400 --> 35:49.289
I've seen 5 collapses!

35:50.880 --> 35:53.406
You know how many men we saved?

35:54.520 --> 35:56.090
No one!

36:07.200 --> 36:09.123
Minister, can you tell us anything?

36:09.360 --> 36:10.441
Yes.

36:12.200 --> 36:14.089
The government is assessing the situation.

36:14.440 --> 36:15.771
Are they alive? Do you know?

36:15.960 --> 36:17.644
What did they tell you?

36:18.320 --> 36:20.482
The mine is extremely unstable.

36:20.720 --> 36:22.882
And dangerous for rescuers.

36:23.320 --> 36:24.401
Therefore,

36:28.600 --> 36:31.604
we have to suspend any further
rescue attempts for the moment.

36:31.800 --> 36:33.086
You promised!

36:33.560 --> 36:34.721
Grab the Minister!

36:35.080 --> 36:36.286
You liar!

36:37.160 --> 36:38.571
Close the gates!

36:40.480 --> 36:41.641
It's not right!

36:41.840 --> 36:42.921
You're abandoning us!

36:43.120 --> 36:44.963
Stand over here, sir.

36:47.000 --> 36:48.604
You promised!

36:49.080 --> 36:51.321
- Please! He's my dad!
- My husband's down there!

36:54.960 --> 36:57.167
Please step back.

36:57.440 --> 36:59.090
Help us!

37:01.160 --> 37:02.844
Lunchtime.

37:08.280 --> 37:10.760
I think we should wait for everyone.

37:11.640 --> 37:12.766
Why?

37:13.640 --> 37:14.846
- I'm hungry.
- Darío.

37:15.120 --> 37:17.600
This food is for an emergency.

37:18.040 --> 37:22.204
- So, what is this, Yonni? A picnic?
- Take it easy.

37:22.440 --> 37:23.851
I'm going to eat, Yonni. Come on.

37:24.000 --> 37:26.162
- Darío... Use your head.
- I want you to move.

37:26.360 --> 37:28.283
- Darío! Hey!
- Move!

37:30.200 --> 37:31.281
Come on!

37:32.880 --> 37:34.484
Look at this crap.

37:35.120 --> 37:36.963
Works for me.

37:41.960 --> 37:43.883
You knew, didn't you?

37:45.680 --> 37:47.250
You knew they never finished the ladders.

37:47.480 --> 37:51.528
You knew this place was a deathtrap
but you let us come down anyway, Lucho.

37:54.320 --> 37:55.810
Listen.

37:57.000 --> 37:59.651
I asked Castillo about the ladders.

37:59.880 --> 38:02.531
I asked him again and again.

38:02.720 --> 38:04.484
He had the certification!

38:04.680 --> 38:05.841
Don Lucho!

38:06.240 --> 38:08.004
What is going on there?

38:09.160 --> 38:10.525
Don Lucho!

38:13.080 --> 38:14.411
Give it back!

38:16.680 --> 38:19.001
Don Lucho! Look at this!

38:19.520 --> 38:21.090
Give me the key.

38:21.560 --> 38:23.050
Give me the key!

38:24.840 --> 38:26.080
You took the food!

38:30.080 --> 38:31.525
What are you doing, Darío?

38:31.720 --> 38:33.131
- Having lunch.
- Oh, having lunch?

38:34.240 --> 38:35.605
You're having lunch?

38:36.200 --> 38:38.362
- This is my food.
- Relax! Stop it!

38:38.560 --> 38:39.561
Back off!

38:39.760 --> 38:41.603
Stop it! Stop it!

38:42.280 --> 38:44.123
Calm down!

38:44.520 --> 38:47.285
It's just some cookies.
What's the big deal?

38:49.600 --> 38:50.931
"What's the big deal?"

38:51.800 --> 38:53.370
Let me tell you.

38:53.600 --> 38:55.728
- There is no ladders to climb.
- Yeah.

38:55.960 --> 38:57.246
And the chimneys just caved in.

38:57.400 --> 38:58.481
What?

38:58.720 --> 39:02.930
And there is a huge rock
blocking our only way out of here.

39:05.600 --> 39:06.726
Guys.

39:09.280 --> 39:10.930
We are buried alive.

39:11.400 --> 39:12.811
That is the big deal.

39:13.400 --> 39:16.961
This is all the food we have left
to keep us alive.

39:17.240 --> 39:19.481
We have to ration it carefully!

39:19.720 --> 39:22.326
If we plan on surviving down here
until we are rescued!

39:22.560 --> 39:23.800
Rescued?

39:27.440 --> 39:29.442
Do you hear any drills?

39:30.920 --> 39:33.764
That's because
they're not drilling for us.

39:36.600 --> 39:38.284
We're too far down.

39:40.160 --> 39:44.085
It took 100 years for them
to dig this deep.

39:44.360 --> 39:46.328
How long do you think
that's going to take?

39:46.520 --> 39:50.491
Do you think the owners are going to
spend that kind of money?

39:50.680 --> 39:53.650
They didn't even finish the ladders!

40:03.760 --> 40:05.842
They'll wait three days,

40:07.960 --> 40:10.645
then close the mine
and put up the gravestones.

40:10.880 --> 40:11.961
No.

40:12.200 --> 40:15.249
No, no, no, no!

40:15.440 --> 40:17.761
I don't believe that!

40:18.440 --> 40:19.851
They'll dig us out!

40:20.920 --> 40:23.605
And if they don't, our families will!

40:23.800 --> 40:25.928
With their bare hands, if it's necessary!

40:29.960 --> 40:33.646
I believe we'll make it out of here
because I choose to believe it!

40:34.800 --> 40:36.370
All 33 of us.

40:36.600 --> 40:39.206
You, Lucho, you believe whatever you want.

40:39.440 --> 40:41.204
It's your problem.

41:01.040 --> 41:02.166
Yep.

41:05.040 --> 41:06.724
Yeah. That's the way.

41:06.960 --> 41:08.962
That rescue better get here pretty quick.

41:09.160 --> 41:10.685
Yep. Give me.

41:11.560 --> 41:13.642
There's 18 cans of tuna.

41:13.840 --> 41:15.968
165 grams a can.

41:16.400 --> 41:20.167
Thirty-three men, that's 90 grams a man.

41:20.360 --> 41:22.249
That's half a can.

41:22.680 --> 41:25.684
A little more for the rest of your lives.

41:27.920 --> 41:29.410
Anybody else?

41:30.160 --> 41:31.924
Thank you. Come on.

41:32.160 --> 41:33.207
Hey.

41:34.720 --> 41:35.846
Thank you.

41:36.040 --> 41:38.042
- Mario.
- Give me.

41:54.880 --> 41:57.087
Early today, the mining
company's rescue team

41:57.360 --> 41:58.850
made an attempt to enter the mine.

41:59.040 --> 42:01.281
Through the ventilation chimneys.

42:01.520 --> 42:05.127
But, a secondary collapse
blocked off any possible access to it.

42:05.400 --> 42:07.607
The mining company has now
relinquished control.

42:07.840 --> 42:08.921
Are you watching this?

42:09.120 --> 42:11.282
The Chilean government is
taking over this operation.

42:11.440 --> 42:12.521
Of course.

42:12.720 --> 42:14.210
I need you up there, Sougarret.

42:14.400 --> 42:15.526
As soon as possible.

42:15.760 --> 42:17.285
Golborne is going to need help.

42:17.520 --> 42:20.046
Everyone I speak to says
you're the best in the business.

42:20.240 --> 42:22.368
Thank you, Mr. President.
I appreciate that.

42:22.600 --> 42:23.726
And you appreciate

42:23.920 --> 42:27.641
that we can't afford to fall on our asses
in front of the whole country.

42:30.960 --> 42:33.725
Which one of you is Laurence Golborne?

42:34.920 --> 42:35.967
Can I help you?

42:38.480 --> 42:40.960
Sougarret. Andre Sougarret.

42:43.480 --> 42:45.130
I'm your new chief engineer.

42:46.720 --> 42:48.006
Says who?

42:48.320 --> 42:49.401
The President.

42:49.760 --> 42:53.606
Now, assuming they're alive,
we got 33 men down there.

42:53.840 --> 42:55.922
They are running out of food and water.

42:56.160 --> 42:58.128
But there is adequate air.

42:58.320 --> 43:01.682
We know that they can survive for a period
of time if they are relatively healthy,

43:01.920 --> 43:03.410
but we don't know that.

43:03.640 --> 43:05.324
Some of them could be injured.

43:05.600 --> 43:08.410
Some of them are in the early
or later stages of silicosis.

43:09.160 --> 43:10.924
Miner's lung disease.

43:11.280 --> 43:15.171
What I do know, is that
if we don't get them up fast,

43:15.640 --> 43:18.120
we're going to be bringing up 33 corpses.

43:19.760 --> 43:20.921
Here's what we know.

43:22.800 --> 43:26.524
The men were working in the lower half
of the mine when it collapsed.

43:26.760 --> 43:29.445
That puts them here, at the refuge.

43:30.160 --> 43:34.049
A 5 meter-wide space 200 stories down.

43:34.640 --> 43:39.043
My readings indicate
that a massive rock displaced itself here.

43:39.840 --> 43:43.049
We're talking about
700,000 tons of diorite.

43:43.440 --> 43:47.729
Or twice the mass
of the Empire State Building.

43:49.120 --> 43:50.645
Obviously,

43:50.840 --> 43:55.004
we can't go in through the front door,
so to speak.

43:56.000 --> 43:57.684
So we're going to have to drill.

43:57.960 --> 43:59.564
Best case scenario,

43:59.800 --> 44:02.963
we reach them in eight days.

44:05.480 --> 44:06.811
Eight days?

44:07.000 --> 44:08.843
They're too far down, too deep.

44:09.080 --> 44:10.366
Eight days?

44:10.560 --> 44:11.891
But that's not the biggest problem.

44:12.160 --> 44:13.366
It's the deviation factor.

44:13.840 --> 44:16.081
Look. Here's the refuge.

44:16.840 --> 44:21.846
If you run these drills 24 hours a day
at full speed,

44:22.040 --> 44:25.567
the drill is going to deviate, like this.

44:26.720 --> 44:28.085
Or like this.

44:28.320 --> 44:31.164
In fact, it can bend 20 different ways.

44:33.160 --> 44:36.084
And even if everything goes
according to plan,

44:36.360 --> 44:38.044
the odds are still going to be against us.

44:43.200 --> 44:44.884
What exactly are you saying?

44:46.400 --> 44:48.402
What I'm saying, Minister,

44:48.600 --> 44:51.683
is that there's a less than
1 % chance of finding them.

44:51.880 --> 44:55.282
I need every drill that you
can get your hands on.

44:55.520 --> 44:58.444
And I want them here as soon as possible.

45:09.640 --> 45:10.926
- Mario.
- Yeah.

45:11.120 --> 45:12.281
This one has less.

45:12.800 --> 45:14.723
- Which one?
- This one.

45:29.640 --> 45:31.642
- Is everybody happy?
- Yeah.

45:52.080 --> 45:54.162
All right, ladies.

45:56.440 --> 45:58.442
Next meal in 24 hours.

45:59.480 --> 46:01.847
How are we supposed to survive on this?

46:02.240 --> 46:04.322
If we get hungry,
we can always eat the Bolivian.

46:09.000 --> 46:11.526
I heard Bolivians taste like chicken.

46:15.280 --> 46:16.327
Look! Look!

46:16.600 --> 46:18.329
They're bringing drills!

46:18.520 --> 46:20.807
The drills are here!

46:28.280 --> 46:30.203
We did it.

47:08.560 --> 47:09.607
Okay.

47:15.680 --> 47:17.762
Twist it. Twist all those wires together.

47:18.320 --> 47:19.845
There will be light.

47:20.040 --> 47:22.281
You cannot live without light.

47:22.480 --> 47:23.527
Tell me, Álex...

47:23.720 --> 47:28.567
Why do you think having a boy
is so much better than having a girl?

47:28.760 --> 47:30.967
Yonni, what is it about a guy like you?

47:31.200 --> 47:35.241
Face like a horse's ass,
nappy hair, bad breath,

47:35.440 --> 47:37.169
you fart in your sleep.

47:37.360 --> 47:39.647
How come the ladies love you so much?

47:39.840 --> 47:42.161
There's 33 guys down here
and I'm the only one

47:42.360 --> 47:44.567
who has a little something going on,
on the side?

47:44.760 --> 47:47.730
No, not in the house
across the street, man!

47:47.960 --> 47:49.485
At least close the curtains!

47:51.040 --> 47:52.530
She doesn't have curtains!

47:57.960 --> 47:59.883
Elvis is in the building.

48:00.800 --> 48:01.847
Shh!

48:04.040 --> 48:05.883
You hear that?

48:09.040 --> 48:10.724
It's a drill.

48:13.560 --> 48:14.971
They're looking for us.

48:17.720 --> 48:20.291
Is that not the sweetest sound
you've ever heard?

48:33.840 --> 48:37.049
The job is so much more
complicated than I thought.

48:37.240 --> 48:40.642
I really want to be there
for Ivy's birthday.

48:41.000 --> 48:43.651
Tell the girls I miss them so much.

48:45.160 --> 48:46.286
Stop, stop!

48:46.520 --> 48:48.443
Look, I've got to call you back.

48:55.200 --> 48:56.611
What happened?

48:59.320 --> 49:01.322
Sougarret! What happened?

49:01.520 --> 49:04.251
You see this diorite?
Twice as hard as granite.

49:04.440 --> 49:06.090
This is the problem.

49:06.280 --> 49:07.645
We're going to need new drills.

49:07.880 --> 49:09.120
Okay, I can get you more drills, but

49:09.320 --> 49:11.243
- we're running out of time.
- I know.

49:11.440 --> 49:13.363
Why are you burning
through them so quickly?

49:13.560 --> 49:16.040
Listen, I don't have six months
to explain to you

49:16.280 --> 49:18.282
the complex geology
of the Atacama Desert...

49:18.480 --> 49:20.448
- That's not what I asked...
- You want to be a miner?

49:20.680 --> 49:22.250
Get a book, read the basics.

49:22.440 --> 49:23.771
Start with orogenesis.

49:23.960 --> 49:26.486
I got 33 men down there
I've got to worry about.

49:26.680 --> 49:28.045
You do what you need to do.

49:28.280 --> 49:31.329
Be a suit, go talk to the media.
Let me do my job.

49:33.520 --> 49:35.045
Why is it taking so much time?

49:36.960 --> 49:38.803
I know you're all growing restless.

49:39.560 --> 49:41.483
I know you want answers.

49:42.520 --> 49:46.966
But I'm here to assure you that we
are doing everything we possibly can

49:47.160 --> 49:49.003
to make contact with your loved ones.

49:49.160 --> 49:51.401
We need to know if they're alive.

49:52.000 --> 49:54.002
I don't have a definitive
answer right now.

49:54.720 --> 49:56.290
That's the truth.

49:56.560 --> 49:59.211
We have 10 drills working 24 hours a day.

50:00.200 --> 50:02.168
Look, I know how you must feel.

50:06.200 --> 50:08.248
I'm going to expand accommodations
for your families.

50:10.160 --> 50:12.891
I'm setting up a commissary,

50:13.080 --> 50:15.082
a medical facility,

50:17.080 --> 50:19.367
and a temporary school for your children.

50:20.120 --> 50:21.963
That's all for now.

50:22.360 --> 50:23.407
Minister!

50:23.680 --> 50:25.808
We know the mine is very dangerous.

50:26.040 --> 50:28.964
It can collapse in any moment. Minister!

50:29.280 --> 50:31.521
Hey, Minister of Mining.

50:31.720 --> 50:33.563
Don't look at me like that.

50:33.800 --> 50:35.802
I'm not going to slap you.

50:38.040 --> 50:41.089
I'm not saying
I'm never going to slap you.

50:44.400 --> 50:45.970
You kept your word.

50:47.120 --> 50:48.167
What's your name?

50:48.920 --> 50:50.684
María Segovia.

50:51.160 --> 50:52.207
Darío's wife.

50:52.440 --> 50:53.851
Sister.

50:54.040 --> 50:55.371
He's my kid brother.

50:58.120 --> 51:00.851
I'm not leaving without him.

51:11.920 --> 51:14.241
They're everywhere!
Please get them off me!

51:14.440 --> 51:16.841
Get them off me! They're everywhere!

51:18.080 --> 51:20.128
I need a drink! Oh, God!

51:20.760 --> 51:21.807
Darío.

51:24.760 --> 51:26.569
I'm dying. I'm dying.

51:26.760 --> 51:29.240
We're all dying. We're all going to die.

51:30.040 --> 51:31.166
It's okay.

51:32.720 --> 51:35.166
There's a lot worse things
in life than death.

51:35.480 --> 51:39.485
How come you have time for me? Huh?

51:40.000 --> 51:42.367
Why don't you hate me like everybody else?

51:42.600 --> 51:44.284
Why? Why?

51:45.600 --> 51:46.965
Hate

51:48.440 --> 51:49.771
is for children.

51:52.160 --> 51:55.369
If we can just be good to each other,

51:56.720 --> 51:57.801
we might find

51:58.680 --> 52:00.728
a way out of here.

52:05.880 --> 52:08.850
We can say a prayer together, if you like.

52:09.040 --> 52:10.883
I don't know the words.

52:12.480 --> 52:14.209
God doesn't care.

52:23.240 --> 52:24.844
Merciful Father.

52:25.800 --> 52:27.165
Merciful Father.

52:27.360 --> 52:28.441
Take

52:29.520 --> 52:30.726
this boy.

52:30.920 --> 52:32.490
Open his eyes.

52:33.520 --> 52:35.284
So he can see.

52:38.360 --> 52:39.805
I'm sorry.

52:40.560 --> 52:41.846
I'm sorry.

52:42.040 --> 52:43.326
It's okay.

52:45.360 --> 52:48.091
- It's okay.
- I'm so sorry.

53:00.920 --> 53:02.081
María, where to?

53:02.720 --> 53:03.926
This way, please.

53:04.120 --> 53:05.690
- Yes, Mayor.
- Good, good, good.

53:06.400 --> 53:10.803
Okay, we're going to school.
Single-file, please.

53:13.840 --> 53:16.525
File in behind me, please.

53:20.960 --> 53:22.200
That one.

53:23.880 --> 53:25.689
- Thank you, Susi.
- Enjoy. Nice to see you.

53:25.880 --> 53:27.166
Excuse me.

53:27.400 --> 53:28.811
What's your name?

53:29.000 --> 53:30.047
What's she been saying?

53:30.240 --> 53:32.447
- What are you doing, Marta?
- Her name is Susana Valenzuela.

53:32.680 --> 53:34.728
- Don't do this. Marta!
- She's my husband's mistress.

53:36.960 --> 53:40.328
Sorry, Susana, but only family members
are permitted inside the fence.

53:40.520 --> 53:42.010
No putas allowed, sorry.

53:42.320 --> 53:43.367
But I am his family.

53:43.560 --> 53:45.483
I love him, and he loves me too!

53:45.840 --> 53:46.887
He loves you?

53:54.160 --> 53:56.640
- Take her stuff.
- You can throw me out, but I'll be back.

53:56.840 --> 53:58.922
And when Yonni comes up,
and he will come up,

53:59.080 --> 54:00.491
we'll see who he loves best!

55:05.320 --> 55:07.243
What is this?

55:07.440 --> 55:09.249
Food and water is low.

55:10.320 --> 55:12.049
We have to make it last.

55:12.880 --> 55:15.565
One tablespoon of tuna every other day,

55:15.800 --> 55:18.326
and a shot of water once a day.

55:18.720 --> 55:19.767
That's it.

55:20.480 --> 55:22.528
I ran it through a filter I made.

55:23.400 --> 55:26.483
It sucks, but it's just
about drinkable, okay?

55:27.080 --> 55:28.411
Álex.

55:28.600 --> 55:29.806
Do yourself a favor.

55:30.000 --> 55:31.047
Yeah?

55:31.560 --> 55:33.050
If we get out of here,

55:34.120 --> 55:37.010
find yourself a new line of work.

55:38.000 --> 55:39.240
Shut up, Gómez.

55:39.520 --> 55:40.851
Shut up!

55:43.040 --> 55:44.166
We're getting close.

55:49.080 --> 55:50.605
Adding the last pipe section.

55:56.400 --> 55:57.970
How many sections?

55:58.200 --> 55:59.247
We got five left.

55:59.440 --> 56:00.771
- Okay.
- We need to set it.

56:02.680 --> 56:03.727
It's a little tight.

56:05.360 --> 56:07.283
We're getting extremely close, sir.

56:07.600 --> 56:08.886
Six!

56:12.400 --> 56:14.562
We're down to the last 6 meters.

56:15.440 --> 56:17.568
Five meters!

56:18.360 --> 56:19.850
Four!

56:20.040 --> 56:21.530
Yeah!

56:32.880 --> 56:34.689
We need to mark it!

56:34.880 --> 56:36.564
Yonni! Get some paint!

56:37.720 --> 56:41.768
When the drill comes through,
we all have to make a lot of noise!

56:44.080 --> 56:45.445
- Write a note!
- I've got it!

57:12.760 --> 57:16.207
What? What happened? Mario?

57:19.840 --> 57:21.649
It's below us.

57:22.440 --> 57:24.124
The thing's below us.

57:24.800 --> 57:28.407
At least they are looking
in the right place.

57:28.600 --> 57:30.523
You still don't get it yet, do you?

57:30.720 --> 57:33.610
It took them this long to get that close!

57:33.840 --> 57:35.763
They're not going to look
for us forever, Mario.

57:35.960 --> 57:37.803
We're starving, Mario!

57:38.600 --> 57:41.365
When they get back, we will be dead!

57:49.160 --> 57:51.242
Álex.

57:52.080 --> 57:53.127
Álex!

57:53.360 --> 57:54.486
Hey!

57:57.000 --> 57:58.047
Hey!

58:12.280 --> 58:15.011
I've been a miner all my life.

58:15.880 --> 58:17.769
I let you down!

58:19.240 --> 58:21.083
I let myself down.

58:22.480 --> 58:24.926
I knew this place was dangerous!

58:25.680 --> 58:27.842
We all knew about this place!

58:28.000 --> 58:29.286
Nobody's blaming you!

58:29.480 --> 58:30.527
You want to blame somebody?

58:30.720 --> 58:33.246
Blame Castillo, blame the owners!

58:42.080 --> 58:43.127
Where is Álex?

58:46.200 --> 58:47.486
Nothing.

59:03.080 --> 59:05.367
It's the deviation, Laurence.

59:05.600 --> 59:07.170
We can't figure it out.

59:12.440 --> 59:14.602
We missed by 10 meters.

59:58.360 --> 01:00:02.206
That's 100 years of piss and shit

01:00:02.440 --> 01:00:03.601
down there.

01:00:03.800 --> 01:00:04.847
Álex!

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:06.604
If you really want to do this,
don't do it alone.

01:00:06.800 --> 01:00:09.201
- Are you crazy?
- No, let's do it together.

01:00:09.440 --> 01:00:11.966
Yes, I am crazy! I am crazy!

01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:14.640
I am completely out of my mind.

01:00:16.520 --> 01:00:18.409
But you know what?

01:00:23.240 --> 01:00:25.004
I have a daughter.

01:00:29.680 --> 01:00:31.648
And a wife.

01:00:33.320 --> 01:00:35.368
And you have a wife

01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:39.007
with a baby on the way,

01:00:43.240 --> 01:00:46.005
and they're counting on you, Álex.

01:00:52.320 --> 01:00:53.924
My baby.

01:00:55.320 --> 01:00:57.243
We need you, man.

01:00:57.880 --> 01:00:59.689
I need you.

01:01:03.720 --> 01:01:06.291
We've already burnt through nine drills.

01:01:07.320 --> 01:01:08.367
This...

01:01:08.880 --> 01:01:11.406
This is becoming an impossible situation.

01:01:11.680 --> 01:01:14.570
Sometimes impossible situations
can take a little longer.

01:01:16.240 --> 01:01:19.687
Laurence, our guys are already
in acute starvation.

01:01:19.880 --> 01:01:21.928
If they are even alive.

01:01:22.800 --> 01:01:26.561
I think we've got to start asking
ourselves the really tough questions.

01:01:27.720 --> 01:01:30.485
How long do you think we can keep this up?

01:01:30.680 --> 01:01:31.727
Hmm?

01:01:43.800 --> 01:01:46.810
What's going on here?
They know the rule. No families allowed.

01:01:49.600 --> 01:01:51.204
It's Don Francisco.

01:02:32.640 --> 01:02:33.766
Shit!

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:35.650
God damn it, Mamani!

01:02:35.840 --> 01:02:38.525
You scared the shit out of me.
What are you doing here?

01:02:39.960 --> 01:02:41.041
The same as you.

01:02:41.280 --> 01:02:42.805
What's with the knife?

01:02:43.360 --> 01:02:45.761
Are you going to cut me up and eat me?

01:02:45.960 --> 01:02:48.770
They say Chileans taste like chicken.

01:02:51.720 --> 01:02:53.848
Maybe you've noticed...

01:02:54.080 --> 01:02:56.321
I don't have a lot of friends down here.

01:03:00.240 --> 01:03:01.401
Where's your head lamp?

01:03:03.520 --> 01:03:05.204
I never got one.

01:03:14.040 --> 01:03:15.371
Here.

01:03:23.720 --> 01:03:25.165
Listen, Mamani, uh...

01:03:26.400 --> 01:03:30.041
Nobody is eating anybody while I am here.

01:03:32.840 --> 01:03:34.524
Did you get that?

01:03:39.880 --> 01:03:41.644
I'm so scared.

01:03:41.840 --> 01:03:44.889
I don't want her growing up
without a father.

01:03:49.960 --> 01:03:51.246
Tell me it's going to be okay.

01:03:51.440 --> 01:03:53.249
- Just say it...
- I can't.

01:03:55.720 --> 01:03:57.882
Just tell me that it's going to be okay.

01:03:58.160 --> 01:04:00.606
Jessi, stop it.

01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:03.726
You know it as well as I do

01:04:03.920 --> 01:04:06.082
that it's not gonna be okay.

01:04:59.680 --> 01:05:02.524
I have been wanting to say something.

01:05:03.680 --> 01:05:05.444
I'm sorry.

01:05:07.960 --> 01:05:11.009
I'm very sorry that I have
stolen from you guys.

01:05:12.200 --> 01:05:15.044
I just hope that one day
you can forgive me.

01:05:16.680 --> 01:05:19.286
I have been saving these for you.

01:05:28.120 --> 01:05:31.488
I just wish I had a box
of them to give you.

01:05:31.800 --> 01:05:33.370
Thank you, Darío.

01:05:34.400 --> 01:05:36.528
Thank you from all of us.

01:05:38.800 --> 01:05:40.848
What I wouldn't do for

01:05:42.040 --> 01:05:45.681
one of your sister's empanadas right now.

01:06:19.760 --> 01:06:21.762
Bless this food. Amen.

01:06:26.560 --> 01:06:27.721
Mmm.

01:06:51.400 --> 01:06:52.447
Jessi.

01:06:54.200 --> 01:06:55.440
Oh, my God.

01:07:00.160 --> 01:07:01.207
Baby.

01:07:12.320 --> 01:07:13.924
Katty.

01:07:34.920 --> 01:07:37.048
It's gonna be okay.

01:07:41.600 --> 01:07:43.284
Mom, what are you doing here?

01:07:43.520 --> 01:07:45.602
Look how skinny you are.

01:07:45.840 --> 01:07:48.081
Yonni, eat.

01:07:48.840 --> 01:07:50.046
Charquicán.

01:07:50.240 --> 01:07:52.811
Your favorite. Excuse me.

01:07:57.480 --> 01:07:58.686
Fresh milk.

01:07:58.960 --> 01:08:00.007
Anyone?

01:08:50.920 --> 01:08:52.490
I just...

01:08:54.560 --> 01:08:57.609
I just want you to know

01:08:59.920 --> 01:09:01.968
that...

01:09:03.800 --> 01:09:05.928
I couldn't be prouder than I am

01:09:06.319 --> 01:09:11.201
to share with you this last meal.

01:09:11.720 --> 01:09:13.484
With all of you.

01:09:24.120 --> 01:09:26.247
If that is the case,

01:09:27.920 --> 01:09:30.651
if this is our last supper,

01:09:30.840 --> 01:09:36.085
I am officially handing in
my retirement papers.

01:09:36.479 --> 01:09:37.765
I quit!

01:10:15.720 --> 01:10:16.767
You called it off.

01:10:19.360 --> 01:10:20.566
It wasn't my decision.

01:10:20.760 --> 01:10:22.410
And this?

01:10:22.560 --> 01:10:23.721
A memorial?

01:10:25.280 --> 01:10:28.090
A poem for the gravestones,
a few words by Pablo Neruda.

01:10:28.320 --> 01:10:29.481
That has nothing to do with me.

01:10:29.680 --> 01:10:31.762
This is bullshit. Look.

01:10:32.640 --> 01:10:34.563
Those people out there are counting on us.

01:10:34.760 --> 01:10:36.489
On you and me.

01:10:36.680 --> 01:10:38.489
Thirty-three men underground.

01:10:38.680 --> 01:10:42.002
Three hundred mothers, fathers,
brothers, sisters,

01:10:42.200 --> 01:10:43.611
and we are their only hope.

01:10:43.840 --> 01:10:46.605
Snap out of it, Laurence.
It's a false hope.

01:10:46.840 --> 01:10:49.081
- And you're giving up!
- Three days' food?

01:10:49.520 --> 01:10:50.806
That's all they had.

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.321
They are down there for 16 days.

01:10:53.560 --> 01:10:56.006
You are giving these families false hope.

01:10:56.200 --> 01:10:57.326
They can survive 40 days without food.

01:10:57.560 --> 01:10:58.766
Not under those conditions, Laurence.

01:10:58.960 --> 01:11:01.691
It's 100 degrees down there.
Do you know what that's like?

01:11:01.880 --> 01:11:03.006
It's a tomb!

01:11:04.400 --> 01:11:06.368
I understand how you feel.
I feel the same.

01:11:06.560 --> 01:11:08.961
I know that your heart is
in the right place.

01:11:09.200 --> 01:11:12.010
- And where's yours?
- It's not about you!

01:11:12.240 --> 01:11:13.605
It's over!

01:11:16.880 --> 01:11:18.803
It's over, Laurence.

01:13:34.040 --> 01:13:35.724
I have something for you.

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:37.047
Hi.

01:13:37.720 --> 01:13:40.690
It's the best empanada in town.

01:13:47.880 --> 01:13:48.927
Mmm.

01:13:53.320 --> 01:13:54.810
I mean well.

01:13:55.960 --> 01:13:57.166
I do.

01:13:58.720 --> 01:14:00.484
I say everything I think.

01:14:01.840 --> 01:14:03.569
That's my trouble.

01:14:07.960 --> 01:14:09.883
I aim to please.

01:14:12.400 --> 01:14:14.084
Somehow I...

01:14:16.120 --> 01:14:18.248
I always find a way to miss.

01:14:18.440 --> 01:14:20.442
Not by miles,

01:14:22.040 --> 01:14:25.123
but I can't seem to learn
from my mistakes.

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.367
You have to sleep.

01:14:38.520 --> 01:14:39.885
Thank you.

01:15:04.040 --> 01:15:06.327
We heard the news, Minister. I'm sorry.

01:15:06.560 --> 01:15:08.642
Don't be. No one is dead yet.

01:15:08.880 --> 01:15:09.927
Restart the drill.

01:15:10.120 --> 01:15:11.929
You got it. You have the azimuth?

01:15:12.960 --> 01:15:14.007
Who?

01:15:14.200 --> 01:15:17.409
The azimuth. The angle, Minister.

01:15:18.320 --> 01:15:19.970
Hey, Laurence.

01:15:22.800 --> 01:15:23.926
You need some help?

01:15:25.320 --> 01:15:27.482
What's on your mind?

01:15:29.320 --> 01:15:30.481
Ground.

01:15:32.960 --> 01:15:34.325
Refuge.

01:15:38.440 --> 01:15:39.680
Drill.

01:15:42.280 --> 01:15:43.964
Look at the direction.

01:15:45.760 --> 01:15:46.966
Look how I drew it.

01:15:47.160 --> 01:15:48.810
Yes, but I don't get your point.

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:50.923
We learn from our mistakes.

01:15:51.120 --> 01:15:53.600
Let the toughness
of the rock be the guide.

01:15:54.160 --> 01:15:57.050
Your drill is facing
in the wrong direction.

01:15:57.280 --> 01:16:00.124
- Exactly.
- This doesn't make any sense.

01:16:00.360 --> 01:16:01.885
Only if you aim to...

01:16:02.080 --> 01:16:03.684
Miss.

01:16:04.040 --> 01:16:05.326
Are you crazy?

01:16:05.520 --> 01:16:08.364
You'll bring the mountain down
on top of these men.

01:16:09.600 --> 01:16:12.490
Stop trying to think
like you're some kind of...

01:16:27.920 --> 01:16:29.206
Why, yes.

01:16:30.480 --> 01:16:33.689
We use the deviational measurement
from our last miss.

01:16:33.880 --> 01:16:36.531
And we already know where
the rock is at its most dense.

01:16:37.720 --> 01:16:39.802
It's so simple.

01:16:40.120 --> 01:16:41.360
Learn from your mistakes.

01:16:41.600 --> 01:16:43.170
Aim to miss.

01:16:50.400 --> 01:16:52.084
Now you're thinking like a miner.

01:16:57.520 --> 01:16:59.045
Keep it going!

01:17:00.880 --> 01:17:02.450
20-degree inclination.

01:17:03.360 --> 01:17:04.964
- Keep going!
- More.

01:17:05.640 --> 01:17:06.766
That's it!

01:17:09.560 --> 01:17:10.891
35!

01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:25.721
Perfect!

01:17:35.800 --> 01:17:37.643
If I have a girl,

01:17:39.200 --> 01:17:41.407
I'm gonna call her Esperanza.

01:17:42.520 --> 01:17:43.965
Jessi would like that.

01:17:44.200 --> 01:17:45.565
Come on, Pastor.

01:17:46.200 --> 01:17:47.440
Drink.

01:17:50.200 --> 01:17:51.850
Stay with me, Pastor.

01:17:53.400 --> 01:17:55.482
Our Father, who art in Heaven,

01:17:57.760 --> 01:18:01.003
hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come...

01:18:01.200 --> 01:18:03.043
Forgive me, my Lord.

01:18:07.720 --> 01:18:10.121
Give us this day our daily bread,

01:18:11.960 --> 01:18:14.486
and forgive us our trespasses,

01:18:16.480 --> 01:18:18.164
as we forgive

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:23.129
those who trespass against us.

01:18:25.240 --> 01:18:28.961
And lead us not into temptation

01:18:30.480 --> 01:18:33.245
but deliver us from evil.

01:18:34.400 --> 01:18:35.481
Amen.

01:19:50.840 --> 01:19:52.490
Drill.

01:19:54.720 --> 01:19:57.371
Drill!

01:19:57.600 --> 01:19:59.011
Drill!

01:19:59.200 --> 01:20:00.326
Hey!

01:20:00.600 --> 01:20:02.090
Come here! Hey!

01:20:02.760 --> 01:20:04.888
Hey! Hey!

01:20:05.560 --> 01:20:06.607
Hey!

01:20:09.680 --> 01:20:10.727
Drill!

01:20:12.520 --> 01:20:13.601
It's here!

01:20:14.200 --> 01:20:15.247
It's here!

01:20:17.760 --> 01:20:19.683
Look, look! Look.

01:20:19.960 --> 01:20:22.406
Look. Hey! Hey, guys!

01:20:24.400 --> 01:20:26.289
Hey!

01:20:42.760 --> 01:20:45.127
We're here! We're here!

01:20:56.160 --> 01:20:58.606
Shh! I hear something.

01:21:05.160 --> 01:21:06.605
Someone's alive.

01:21:07.840 --> 01:21:09.490
Shut down the generators.

01:21:11.800 --> 01:21:13.006
Could be rock fall.

01:21:13.200 --> 01:21:14.247
Stethoscope.

01:21:16.320 --> 01:21:17.606
Here.

01:21:34.200 --> 01:21:35.247
I have the note.

01:21:35.520 --> 01:21:37.010
I have the note!

01:22:02.160 --> 01:22:03.321
Okay, stop!

01:22:07.720 --> 01:22:09.165
It's been painted.

01:22:12.840 --> 01:22:13.887
You sure it wasn't there before?

01:22:14.120 --> 01:22:15.849
- Definitely not, sir.
- There's something there.

01:22:16.040 --> 01:22:17.201
Where?

01:22:26.240 --> 01:22:28.322
Oh, my God.

01:22:33.360 --> 01:22:34.646
Oh, my God!

01:22:37.160 --> 01:22:41.165
This message comes to us
from the depths of the earth.

01:22:41.520 --> 01:22:44.205
From the very hands of our miners.

01:22:46.360 --> 01:22:49.523
"We are all well in the refuge.

01:22:49.720 --> 01:22:51.131
"The 33."

01:22:54.080 --> 01:22:56.003
Viva Chile, mierda!

01:23:03.960 --> 01:23:05.883
- Gracias.
- De nada.

01:23:06.720 --> 01:23:08.210
Gracias.

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:10.047
Susi!

01:23:10.240 --> 01:23:11.526
Marta!

01:23:16.440 --> 01:23:17.521
He's alive!

01:23:19.200 --> 01:23:21.931
They're safe! They're all safe!

01:23:26.240 --> 01:23:28.242
I knew you could do it.

01:23:29.440 --> 01:23:32.205
We found them. Now we got to get them out.

01:23:32.600 --> 01:23:35.604
Nobody has ever done
anything like this before.

01:23:53.280 --> 01:23:54.850
God bless our miners!

01:23:55.080 --> 01:23:56.491
God bless them!

01:23:59.600 --> 01:24:02.251
It's Luis Urzúa, the supervisor.

01:24:08.320 --> 01:24:09.606
Can you hear me?

01:24:09.800 --> 01:24:10.847
Yes.

01:24:11.280 --> 01:24:12.930
I can hear you.

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:17.368
This is Laurence Golborne,
the Minister of Mining.

01:24:17.840 --> 01:24:18.966
How are you?

01:24:22.680 --> 01:24:26.165
Seventeen days is a long time,
and after 17 days,

01:24:26.360 --> 01:24:28.761
you wouldn't have blamed
rescuers for losing hope.

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:33.289
Until they got the sign, that is,
that 33 miners, all of them,

01:24:33.480 --> 01:24:36.047
2,000 feet down, were okay.

01:24:52.840 --> 01:24:55.810
The families today get a chance
to do what they do once a week.

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:57.843
They get to meet via video conference

01:24:58.040 --> 01:25:00.520
with their loved ones down below
for about 8 minutes.

01:25:00.720 --> 01:25:03.690
Three platforms are now in place,
specialized in deep drilling.

01:25:03.880 --> 01:25:05.484
The Australian drill, Plan A,

01:25:05.680 --> 01:25:08.490
is going directly into
the miners' emergency shelter

01:25:08.680 --> 01:25:10.842
which is 2,300 feet below the surface.

01:25:18.840 --> 01:25:21.320
Down here is Plan B.

01:25:21.520 --> 01:25:23.409
Now, this is a T-130 drill.

01:25:23.680 --> 01:25:27.321
That is going to be manned
by the U.S. engineer Jeff Hart.

01:25:27.520 --> 01:25:30.888
It's a pretty blunt instrument.
It's like a huge jackhammer.

01:25:31.080 --> 01:25:33.686
But it could get through
the ground very quickly.

01:25:33.880 --> 01:25:34.961
One guy has a drug problem,

01:25:35.160 --> 01:25:37.686
another suffers from depression,
another guy is bipolar.

01:25:38.680 --> 01:25:41.570
These men are going to start
killing each other

01:25:41.760 --> 01:25:43.330
if they're down there for much longer.

01:25:43.520 --> 01:25:46.683
And this is going to go on
for three months at least.

01:25:46.880 --> 01:25:47.927
Three months?

01:25:49.200 --> 01:25:50.850
- Are you recording?
- Yeah.

01:25:51.400 --> 01:25:53.164
Uh...

01:25:53.320 --> 01:25:56.563
My name is Mario Sepúlveda.

01:25:56.720 --> 01:25:59.041
Welcome to the

01:25:59.240 --> 01:26:02.528
San Jose Mine Resort Hilton.

01:26:02.760 --> 01:26:04.250
We'll take a look around.

01:26:05.040 --> 01:26:07.407
Guys, more palomas coming in!

01:26:08.080 --> 01:26:09.411
Nikes.

01:26:11.400 --> 01:26:13.448
And iPods for everyone!

01:26:14.920 --> 01:26:17.241
Hey, Gómez! Here are your dirty magazines.

01:26:28.640 --> 01:26:30.449
- Mario?
- Hi, Dad.

01:26:30.640 --> 01:26:32.563
- Can you hear us?
- Can you hear, Dad?

01:26:32.760 --> 01:26:34.569
Yeah. Yeah.

01:26:34.760 --> 01:26:36.922
How are you? Other than skinny.

01:26:37.120 --> 01:26:38.963
- Katty.
- You're so skinny.

01:26:39.160 --> 01:26:40.730
Escarlette.

01:26:44.120 --> 01:26:45.281
It's okay, Dad.

01:27:04.480 --> 01:27:05.527
Here it is.

01:27:06.840 --> 01:27:09.650
Couldn't see if it was a boy or a girl.

01:27:10.640 --> 01:27:12.369
Let it be a surprise, Álex.

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:14.764
I don't want to know.

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:17.968
As long as you two are good.

01:27:18.160 --> 01:27:19.969
That's all that matters.

01:27:20.160 --> 01:27:21.207
Dad...

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:23.206
Álex.

01:27:24.120 --> 01:27:25.610
I've missed you.

01:27:29.680 --> 01:27:32.126
Another one of us.

01:27:32.320 --> 01:27:34.084
No, don't, don't...

01:27:34.840 --> 01:27:36.524
People don't need to see that.

01:27:36.720 --> 01:27:38.165
People don't need to see that.

01:27:38.360 --> 01:27:41.807
And the fact that I was
in the military for a while

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:45.368
allowed me just to know
how to organize people.

01:27:53.120 --> 01:27:55.691
You are famous, Mario.

01:27:56.400 --> 01:27:58.323
Don Francisco was here.

01:27:59.040 --> 01:28:03.451
He said last night that you were
the most famous man in Chile.

01:28:04.400 --> 01:28:06.243
Don Francisco said that?

01:28:06.560 --> 01:28:08.642
We will get you out.

01:28:08.880 --> 01:28:12.161
And to see your families by Christmas.

01:28:15.280 --> 01:28:18.329
We'll be waiting for you.
Goodbye, and God bless.

01:28:18.560 --> 01:28:20.050
- All right, he's gone.
- Christmas?

01:28:20.240 --> 01:28:22.004
- Listen, listen.
- That's three months!

01:28:23.480 --> 01:28:24.925
No, listen! Listen to me!

01:28:25.160 --> 01:28:27.640
Disappointing news from Chile.
The Canadian drill, Plan C,

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:32.369
has been shut down indefinitely
due to unexpected technical difficulties.

01:28:32.560 --> 01:28:35.245
The drill and its team,
which the families had high hopes for,

01:28:35.440 --> 01:28:36.726
are now headed home.

01:29:04.240 --> 01:29:06.049
Have your husband sign them.

01:29:07.440 --> 01:29:11.451
And please, if you have
any questions, call me, okay?

01:29:11.640 --> 01:29:13.961
I'm going to read them and talk to Mario.

01:29:14.400 --> 01:29:16.164
We're talking about

01:29:17.960 --> 01:29:20.247
a lot of money.

01:29:20.440 --> 01:29:21.646
Katty,

01:29:22.640 --> 01:29:24.244
keep it to yourself.

01:29:24.440 --> 01:29:26.124
- Farkas!
- Look, it's Farkas!

01:29:26.920 --> 01:29:28.331
How are you, how are you?

01:29:28.560 --> 01:29:32.002
I'm going to give you enough money so your
husbands don't have to work for a year.

01:29:33.920 --> 01:29:36.764
I'm going to give you each $10,000.

01:29:59.800 --> 01:30:01.484
Darío.

01:30:01.840 --> 01:30:03.171
Darío.

01:30:10.840 --> 01:30:13.810
The huge slab of rock,
the so-called "megastone,"

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:16.446
twice the size of the
Empire State Building,

01:30:16.680 --> 01:30:19.286
is believed to have shifted
in the last few hours.

01:30:19.840 --> 01:30:24.201
It has added yet more urgency to
the rescue effort here, on the surface.

01:30:31.200 --> 01:30:33.123
We hit steel.

01:30:33.400 --> 01:30:35.562
Most likely a horizontal support.

01:30:35.800 --> 01:30:36.926
A beam or something.

01:30:37.160 --> 01:30:38.605
Anyway, we busted the bit.

01:30:38.800 --> 01:30:41.724
Bitch is stuck down in that
borehole like a dummy.

01:30:42.240 --> 01:30:43.366
Let's replace the bit.

01:30:43.560 --> 01:30:47.167
No, the piece of bit
is 1,420 feet down there.

01:30:47.360 --> 01:30:49.647
We're not drilling until we
get that piece out of there.

01:30:49.880 --> 01:30:51.211
However that is.

01:30:51.480 --> 01:30:55.722
I'm calling my contacts in Brazil,
get us some big old magnets.

01:30:59.240 --> 01:31:00.321
Oh.

01:31:02.600 --> 01:31:05.080
Mario, there's no drills.
They're not drilling.

01:31:07.080 --> 01:31:08.525
Are you listening to me?

01:31:08.840 --> 01:31:11.411
- Okay, that's good.
- Hey, Yonni, listen to this.

01:31:11.640 --> 01:31:14.883
"Marta, the wife of miner Yonni Barrios,

01:31:15.080 --> 01:31:17.890
"had Yonni's mistress
removed from Camp Hope

01:31:18.080 --> 01:31:19.764
"for the third time."

01:31:22.880 --> 01:31:27.283
"Susi, Yonni's mistress,
is happy being a home wrecker."

01:31:28.960 --> 01:31:31.122
Now the whole world thinks
that Susi is a whore

01:31:31.360 --> 01:31:34.091
and that I'm a two-timing scumbag.

01:31:34.280 --> 01:31:35.611
Well...

01:31:35.960 --> 01:31:37.610
That's not right.

01:31:38.720 --> 01:31:40.085
I don't believe this.

01:31:40.280 --> 01:31:42.760
Our fearless leader, Super Mario,

01:31:42.960 --> 01:31:44.803
who will tell anyone
who is willing to listen

01:31:45.040 --> 01:31:48.408
that he is the one solely
responsible for our survival,

01:31:48.760 --> 01:31:51.127
has been offered a book deal for

01:31:51.400 --> 01:31:53.926
"an undisclosed sum."

01:31:58.560 --> 01:31:59.891
Undisclosed sum, huh?

01:32:01.560 --> 01:32:02.721
What's the sum, Mario?

01:32:05.280 --> 01:32:09.649
Were you planning on
having any of us in this book deal?

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:12.445
- Did you do it?
- Of course he did it.

01:32:12.640 --> 01:32:14.165
You know what, "Fearless Leader"?

01:32:14.400 --> 01:32:16.448
We're going to get along
just fine without you.

01:32:16.640 --> 01:32:18.165
You really think I need you?

01:32:18.760 --> 01:32:19.807
Any of you?

01:32:25.240 --> 01:32:27.322
You know, the leader

01:32:28.240 --> 01:32:31.528
makes sure you don't starve.

01:32:32.280 --> 01:32:34.123
The leader keeps the lights on.

01:32:34.360 --> 01:32:36.681
No, you had some help with the lights on.

01:32:36.920 --> 01:32:38.001
Yes, me.

01:32:38.280 --> 01:32:39.327
What are you doing?

01:32:40.160 --> 01:32:41.889
- We don't need you!
- You did this, Mario!

01:32:42.360 --> 01:32:45.807
We've had enough. Get out.
Get out of here!

01:32:47.640 --> 01:32:49.165
The leader never gives up.

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:53.843
You know,

01:32:54.120 --> 01:32:57.363
you wouldn't be here if it wasn't for me.

01:32:58.280 --> 01:33:00.362
I never asked for this.

01:33:01.600 --> 01:33:03.682
You gave it to me.

01:33:10.960 --> 01:33:12.121
You listen to me, Golborne.

01:33:12.360 --> 01:33:14.522
None of your drills are working.

01:33:14.720 --> 01:33:16.722
That is unacceptable!

01:33:16.960 --> 01:33:19.167
We spent millions of dollars
bringing them down here.

01:33:19.400 --> 01:33:20.731
We made no secret of that.

01:33:20.960 --> 01:33:23.804
Now you tell me
the American drill is down?

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:27.368
The drill bit fractured in the borehole,
but we have magnets coming in from Brazil.

01:33:27.600 --> 01:33:28.647
Heavy-duty magnets...

01:33:28.840 --> 01:33:30.285
I don't want to hear about your magnets!

01:33:30.480 --> 01:33:32.084
The mine is crumbling!

01:33:32.320 --> 01:33:34.209
We're running out of time, Golborne.

01:33:38.480 --> 01:33:45.204
There's talk of lawsuits
and criminal charges from the families.

01:33:45.400 --> 01:33:47.721
I don't have to tell you

01:33:47.920 --> 01:33:51.683
the miners occupy a privileged position

01:33:51.880 --> 01:33:53.689
in the affections of the Chilean people.

01:33:53.880 --> 01:33:57.885
The last thing we need is these men dying

01:33:58.080 --> 01:34:00.048
with the whole world watching!

01:34:00.240 --> 01:34:02.607
I don't think it's going too far to say

01:34:02.840 --> 01:34:06.208
that the future of this administration
depends on the outcome.

01:34:06.400 --> 01:34:07.845
Mr. President, I can...

01:34:30.920 --> 01:34:32.285
Darío.

01:34:54.840 --> 01:34:56.410
You want to say something to me?

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:00.844
You know María, my sister, right?

01:35:01.600 --> 01:35:03.011
Yeah.

01:35:05.160 --> 01:35:08.721
I have been mad at her all of my life.

01:35:10.400 --> 01:35:12.801
She abandoned me when I was just a kid.

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:17.565
I mean, she was a kid also, and had
already raised my other five siblings.

01:35:18.200 --> 01:35:21.568
She just needed her own life.

01:35:22.280 --> 01:35:24.965
I couldn't see that before.

01:35:28.360 --> 01:35:31.250
I know she's up there,
I know she's waiting for me,

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:33.650
but what am I supposed to say?

01:35:33.840 --> 01:35:36.081
What am I supposed to do when we get out?

01:35:36.320 --> 01:35:37.685
If we get out.

01:35:39.440 --> 01:35:41.442
You hug her

01:35:41.680 --> 01:35:43.682
and you cry like a baby.

01:35:45.200 --> 01:35:48.522
Forgive her for everything
that she has ever done.

01:35:49.560 --> 01:35:52.086
You pray to God that she forgives you.

01:35:56.560 --> 01:35:58.369
She's your family.

01:35:59.760 --> 01:36:02.764
María is all the family you've got.

01:36:07.360 --> 01:36:08.885
Family...

01:36:11.920 --> 01:36:14.287
Family is all we have.

01:36:52.640 --> 01:36:54.210
That's my iPod.

01:36:54.760 --> 01:36:56.842
You're a thieving Bolivian Indian.

01:36:57.080 --> 01:36:59.242
- We all got iPods.
- It's my iPod.

01:36:59.440 --> 01:37:01.408
- It's not yours.
- Give me my iPod.

01:37:01.600 --> 01:37:03.125
- It's not yours!
- Give me my iPod!

01:37:04.680 --> 01:37:06.569
It's not yours, Elvis!

01:37:09.360 --> 01:37:10.771
Mamani.

01:37:10.960 --> 01:37:12.007
Stop!

01:37:12.200 --> 01:37:15.409
Kid, look at me! Look at me!

01:37:15.800 --> 01:37:18.804
That's the Devil guiding your hand.

01:37:20.840 --> 01:37:22.330
Give me that.

01:37:28.440 --> 01:37:32.126
You were going to kill a man
over this piece of shit?

01:37:34.280 --> 01:37:35.486
For what?

01:37:38.480 --> 01:37:40.642
Because some fat cat says
he's gonna give us some money?

01:37:41.160 --> 01:37:44.651
Because some whore writes
some gossip about your family life?

01:37:45.040 --> 01:37:47.407
Come over here. Come over here.

01:37:47.600 --> 01:37:48.761
So what?

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:50.286
So some people wanna break your balls

01:37:50.480 --> 01:37:52.164
because you are a Bolivian?
You are a Bolivian.

01:37:52.360 --> 01:37:54.408
So, what is that, what is that?

01:37:54.680 --> 01:37:55.727
Come on.

01:37:56.040 --> 01:37:57.849
What about me?

01:37:58.080 --> 01:38:01.209
Calling myself the leader down here.

01:38:01.520 --> 01:38:04.808
Throwing my weight around,
thinking, you know,

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:06.809
that I did everything on my own.

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:08.047
No.

01:38:08.440 --> 01:38:10.329
No, this is not me.

01:38:10.720 --> 01:38:12.882
This is not us.

01:38:13.120 --> 01:38:15.771
We all know what is up there.

01:38:15.960 --> 01:38:17.007
It's a circus.

01:38:17.240 --> 01:38:20.164
So let's not get too far ahead
of ourselves.

01:38:20.400 --> 01:38:21.686
No, let's don't do that,

01:38:21.880 --> 01:38:24.087
because we are not going
to get anything out of this.

01:38:24.280 --> 01:38:25.327
Anything.

01:38:25.520 --> 01:38:29.206
We walked in miners and we will walk out

01:38:30.880 --> 01:38:32.325
miners.

01:38:36.480 --> 01:38:38.562
I didn't sign the book deal.

01:38:40.120 --> 01:38:41.167
Was I going to?

01:38:41.360 --> 01:38:42.486
Yes.

01:38:42.720 --> 01:38:45.849
Did I want to provide for
my family and for my kid?

01:38:46.040 --> 01:38:48.088
Yeah. But I didn't.

01:38:48.520 --> 01:38:49.851
I didn't. Why?

01:38:54.200 --> 01:38:55.531
Because of you.

01:38:55.720 --> 01:38:57.370
Because you're my brothers,

01:38:57.560 --> 01:39:00.484
and if we want to stay brothers,
we got to pull together

01:39:01.440 --> 01:39:03.249
to get out of here.

01:39:05.880 --> 01:39:07.006
Yeah.

01:39:12.920 --> 01:39:14.081
I'm sorry.

01:39:16.920 --> 01:39:18.445
I'm very sorry.

01:39:35.400 --> 01:39:37.129
Welcome back, Mario.

01:39:38.320 --> 01:39:39.606
Welcome back.

01:39:44.960 --> 01:39:47.088
Here it comes!

01:39:56.040 --> 01:39:57.087
I knew it!

01:39:57.280 --> 01:39:58.327
Yes!

01:39:58.520 --> 01:39:59.965
Back to work!

01:40:00.160 --> 01:40:01.810
Vicente! Hey!

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:03.206
Come on, get up.

01:40:03.400 --> 01:40:05.004
Let's get ourselves some miners.

01:40:05.200 --> 01:40:06.645
We got it out. We're gonna restart.

01:40:07.880 --> 01:40:10.611
I figure about 20-40 we're gonna hit 'em.

01:40:10.800 --> 01:40:13.451
Hey, Vicente! Hey. Okay, guys.

01:40:13.640 --> 01:40:15.449
- Come on, let's go.
- Arriba.

01:40:16.280 --> 01:40:18.123
Get some coffee over here.

01:40:18.600 --> 01:40:19.647
Come on, son!

01:40:28.520 --> 01:40:30.045
Lieutenant.

01:40:31.120 --> 01:40:33.009
Take down the fence.

01:40:33.200 --> 01:40:34.247
All of it.

01:40:34.440 --> 01:40:35.487
Yes, sir.

01:40:46.760 --> 01:40:48.967
Come in. Everyone.

01:40:49.160 --> 01:40:50.241
Please.

01:41:08.200 --> 01:41:11.807
You're coming in too close
to some iron support beams.

01:41:12.040 --> 01:41:15.601
If she hits those beams,
that drill is a goner.

01:41:15.800 --> 01:41:18.007
We're going to have to clear it
ourselves from down here.

01:41:18.200 --> 01:41:19.565
How?

01:41:21.720 --> 01:41:23.051
A controlled explosion.

01:41:23.240 --> 01:41:26.005
No, no, no, Don Lucho. That's a negative.

01:41:26.200 --> 01:41:29.682
The mountain is completely unstable.
You need another option.

01:41:29.880 --> 01:41:31.166
We know.

01:41:32.720 --> 01:41:36.406
We know it's unstable,
but it's the only way.

01:41:38.080 --> 01:41:41.004
We're all ready to get out of here.

01:41:41.240 --> 01:41:42.844
Or die trying.

01:41:44.360 --> 01:41:46.408
Álex! Mario!

01:41:46.600 --> 01:41:49.604
We're going to bolster the beam
with these timbers, here.

01:41:49.800 --> 01:41:52.849
The charges will be placed here,
correlating to this.

01:42:00.520 --> 01:42:01.681
Jessi.

01:42:03.600 --> 01:42:04.886
I'll take you to the hospital.

01:42:05.080 --> 01:42:06.730
No, I'm staying right here, Don José.

01:42:06.920 --> 01:42:07.967
I'm not leaving Álex.

01:42:23.680 --> 01:42:24.886
Susi.

01:42:25.960 --> 01:42:27.246
From Yonni.

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:30.445
He wrote me.

01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:33.082
- Oh, my God.
- He spoke to the Minister.

01:42:33.320 --> 01:42:35.243
You belong at Camp Hope with us.

01:42:35.440 --> 01:42:36.646
- I get to come in?
- Yes.

01:42:37.120 --> 01:42:39.282
Marta, why are you leaving us?

01:42:39.480 --> 01:42:41.005
I decided to leave him.

01:42:41.240 --> 01:42:43.004
He doesn't deserve a woman like me.

01:42:43.440 --> 01:42:45.363
Besides, he farts in his sleep.

01:42:45.600 --> 01:42:46.681
Excuse me.

01:42:48.280 --> 01:42:49.327
Okay, okay.

01:42:58.680 --> 01:42:59.806
Okay.

01:43:02.560 --> 01:43:03.607
Carlos Mamani.

01:43:03.920 --> 01:43:04.967
Okay?

01:43:08.800 --> 01:43:10.529
Are you ladies ready?

01:43:10.920 --> 01:43:12.570
Hell of a first day, eh, Bolivian?

01:43:13.320 --> 01:43:15.766
Make sure you put in for some overtime.
Come on, baby.

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:18.526
3... 2... 1!

01:43:46.520 --> 01:43:47.567
Look!

01:43:48.880 --> 01:43:50.245
Here she comes!

01:43:58.880 --> 01:44:00.006
All right, we're in.

01:44:03.640 --> 01:44:05.961
You did it! Thank you, Jeff.

01:44:07.440 --> 01:44:09.249
You're Chile's new national hero.

01:44:09.520 --> 01:44:11.841
Decked out in the colors
of the national flag,

01:44:12.040 --> 01:44:16.361
this is Fenix 1, the rescue capsule
that Chilean authorities,

01:44:16.600 --> 01:44:19.729
along with most of the world,
are now pinning their hopes on.

01:44:19.920 --> 01:44:24.050
The metal cage is designed to haul
the 33 miners, one by one,

01:44:24.240 --> 01:44:26.049
from 700 meters below ground

01:44:26.480 --> 01:44:29.768
to the sunlight they haven't
seen now for 62 days.

01:44:32.880 --> 01:44:34.370
Open it up.

01:44:40.680 --> 01:44:41.727
Okay.

01:44:50.960 --> 01:44:52.485
It's sinking.

01:44:53.480 --> 01:44:54.925
How fast?

01:44:55.120 --> 01:44:56.360
Too fast.

01:44:57.080 --> 01:44:58.684
You see this green line?

01:44:58.920 --> 01:45:01.241
We marked this stone yesterday.

01:45:01.760 --> 01:45:03.569
You see how far it has come down?

01:45:03.760 --> 01:45:06.604
I guess the explosion has done its job.

01:45:07.440 --> 01:45:09.886
700,000 tons of rock

01:45:10.320 --> 01:45:14.166
sitting just directly over their heads.

01:45:15.160 --> 01:45:17.401
It's not a question of if it falls,
but when.

01:45:18.800 --> 01:45:21.087
Okay, guys, here's the situation.

01:45:21.680 --> 01:45:24.490
We just don't have time
to reinforce the shaft.

01:45:25.280 --> 01:45:27.681
If anything happens to the Fenix capsule,

01:45:27.920 --> 01:45:31.970
if its mechanism fails
or the walls of the shaft collapse,

01:45:32.840 --> 01:45:34.808
I have to tell you

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:38.049
that there is a real possibility
we can't get you guys out.

01:45:39.480 --> 01:45:42.006
The guy who goes first

01:45:42.200 --> 01:45:44.202
will be in the greatest danger.

01:45:44.440 --> 01:45:48.240
But could also be the only one
to make it out.

01:45:48.480 --> 01:45:50.687
You decide who that man will be.

01:46:47.400 --> 01:46:48.447
Fenix.

01:46:59.200 --> 01:47:00.247
Sir?

01:47:00.760 --> 01:47:02.683
We're ready for initiation.

01:47:27.440 --> 01:47:29.010
- Yeah.
- Go, Álex!

01:47:37.160 --> 01:47:39.162
See you old men

01:47:41.440 --> 01:47:42.646
up there.

01:47:43.040 --> 01:47:44.610
Okay?

01:47:46.560 --> 01:47:47.846
Okay.

01:47:49.880 --> 01:47:51.450
Get in there.

01:48:09.800 --> 01:48:10.961
We are ready.

01:48:11.160 --> 01:48:13.845
Sir, they're good to go.

01:48:14.600 --> 01:48:15.681
All right.

01:48:16.520 --> 01:48:20.161
On the count of 3, begin the ascent.

01:48:20.360 --> 01:48:22.681
Beginning ascent in 3, 2...

01:48:25.280 --> 01:48:26.361
Come on!

01:48:49.760 --> 01:48:51.842
700 meters.

01:48:52.640 --> 01:48:54.483
Mr. Vega is looking good.

01:49:10.320 --> 01:49:13.529
The capsule is holding steady, 500 meters.

01:49:13.720 --> 01:49:14.881
500-meter mark.

01:49:17.600 --> 01:49:20.251
Look, his heart rate
is all over the place.

01:49:20.480 --> 01:49:22.528
He's nervous. Who wouldn't be?

01:49:22.720 --> 01:49:24.768
The mountain is stable.

01:49:25.320 --> 01:49:26.970
Everything looks good.

01:49:27.200 --> 01:49:29.441
Rate of ascent is within
normal parameters.

01:49:29.680 --> 01:49:30.920
400 meters.

01:49:32.240 --> 01:49:33.765
300 meters.

01:49:39.160 --> 01:49:40.321
Ignacio, what happened?

01:49:40.520 --> 01:49:43.046
The capsule is trapped in the borehole
and we lost biometrics.

01:49:43.240 --> 01:49:44.287
There's a problem.

01:49:45.320 --> 01:49:46.731
Hey!

01:49:47.400 --> 01:49:48.686
Hey!

01:49:48.880 --> 01:49:50.291
- Stand by.
- It's not moving.

01:49:51.640 --> 01:49:53.802
We don't have a visual down here.

01:49:58.160 --> 01:49:59.491
I'm gonna try and reverse it.

01:49:59.680 --> 01:50:00.761
Don Lucho.

01:50:01.320 --> 01:50:02.685
The capsule is stuck.

01:50:03.080 --> 01:50:04.923
They're reversing the Fenix.

01:50:06.320 --> 01:50:07.731
What happened?

01:50:11.880 --> 01:50:13.211
Here we go.

01:50:16.200 --> 01:50:18.168
Okay, beginning descent.

01:50:20.200 --> 01:50:21.361
Is he breathing?

01:50:21.560 --> 01:50:24.325
We have no way of knowing
what his oxygen supply is.

01:50:30.320 --> 01:50:31.401
Oh, man.

01:50:33.480 --> 01:50:34.561
Hey!

01:50:36.880 --> 01:50:38.484
- Shine it down there.
- Anything?

01:50:42.760 --> 01:50:44.569
I'm gonna try again.

01:50:46.880 --> 01:50:48.450
The wheel has stopped.

01:50:54.640 --> 01:50:56.324
Okay, it's moving.

01:50:56.640 --> 01:50:57.801
The capsule is moving.

01:51:01.480 --> 01:51:04.086
- What happened?
- We lost the feed, we lost Álex.

01:51:04.280 --> 01:51:05.884
They've lost contact.

01:51:39.680 --> 01:51:41.091
He made it?

01:51:41.320 --> 01:51:42.924
He made it!

01:51:43.200 --> 01:51:44.531
Dad.

01:51:44.880 --> 01:51:46.120
Mijo.

01:52:04.440 --> 01:52:06.522
This is your baby girl.

01:52:07.120 --> 01:52:08.645
Esperanza.

01:52:08.880 --> 01:52:10.211
Oh, my God.

01:52:22.400 --> 01:52:23.447
Mario.

01:52:23.680 --> 01:52:25.011
Good luck, Mario.

01:52:26.360 --> 01:52:27.566
See you soon.

01:52:28.120 --> 01:52:30.521
Goodbye, huevónes!

01:52:31.040 --> 01:52:32.849
I love you!

01:52:33.440 --> 01:52:35.488
I love you!

01:52:37.600 --> 01:52:39.762
Yeah, baby! Come on!

01:52:42.280 --> 01:52:43.645
I'm coming, Katty!

01:52:48.120 --> 01:52:50.122
Minister. Finally I meet you.

01:52:50.360 --> 01:52:52.408
- Call me Laurence, Mario.
- Laurence.

01:53:04.200 --> 01:53:05.725
Mario! Over here!

01:53:05.960 --> 01:53:07.246
Mario! Mario!

01:53:07.440 --> 01:53:09.090
Hey, my brothers, thank you!

01:53:09.280 --> 01:53:11.282
Thank you for everything!

01:53:15.040 --> 01:53:16.610
- Let's go for a "Chi!"
- Chi!

01:53:16.800 --> 01:53:18.290
- Let's go for a "le!"
- Le!

01:53:18.520 --> 01:53:20.522
Chi, Chi, Chi! Le, le, le!

01:53:40.800 --> 01:53:42.484
Viva Chile!

01:53:53.200 --> 01:53:54.850
Thank you for never giving up on us!

01:53:55.080 --> 01:53:56.844
Thank you for never giving up!

01:53:57.080 --> 01:53:59.242
I love you, Copiapó!

01:53:59.440 --> 01:54:01.010
Elvis, Elvis!

01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:10.162
Yonni! Yonni!

01:54:12.400 --> 01:54:13.925
- Susi.
- I love you!

01:54:23.440 --> 01:54:25.010
Darío, Darío.

01:54:42.080 --> 01:54:43.525
My sister, María Segovia. Do you know her?

01:54:43.720 --> 01:54:45.802
Right there. Right there. Come.

01:54:50.720 --> 01:54:52.882
Darío, Darío.

01:54:53.280 --> 01:54:54.327
Where?

01:54:56.680 --> 01:54:57.966
María?

01:54:59.160 --> 01:55:00.810
María?

01:55:59.240 --> 01:56:00.366
María?

01:56:43.240 --> 01:56:44.605
Thank you.

01:56:46.440 --> 01:56:48.283
Thank you.
