00:00.625 --> 00:01.625
Hi, guys.

00:01.625 --> 00:02.958
- Hi.
- Hey.

00:02.958 --> 00:05.583
Hey, it's the happy couple
who, instead of breaking up,

00:05.583 --> 00:07.583
became "just friends."

00:07.583 --> 00:11.375
How's that
working out for ya?

00:11.375 --> 00:14.625
Great. And Harper's
helping, too.

00:14.625 --> 00:15.958
She sat between us
at the movies today

00:15.958 --> 00:17.750
so we weren't tempted
to hold hands.

00:17.750 --> 00:21.083
- Thank you, friend wall.
- Friend wall?

00:21.083 --> 00:22.416
That's why you put me
in the middle?

00:22.416 --> 00:23.500
I thought you guys
were fighting

00:23.500 --> 00:25.333
over who got to
sit next to me.

00:25.333 --> 00:28.708
Well, I still took
both arm rests,
so who's laughing now?

00:30.375 --> 00:33.375
Plus, being just friends
means I don't have to worry

00:33.375 --> 00:37.708
about my breath
smelling like popcorn,
hot sauce, and pickle juice.

00:37.708 --> 00:39.625
You never worried
about that before.

00:39.625 --> 00:41.875
I know. I was a real catch,
wasn't I?

00:43.458 --> 00:45.583
I know you gave up
the wizard competition,

00:45.583 --> 00:47.416
and now you
can't be with Mason

00:47.416 --> 00:50.875
because werewolves and mortals
can't be together, but...

00:50.875 --> 00:54.083
Oh, my gosh,
I'm the mom of a horror film!

00:55.958 --> 00:58.416
Unfortunately, this movie's
not over in two hours.

00:58.416 --> 01:02.458
It just keeps going
and going and going...

01:04.208 --> 01:05.583
Don't listen to them, Mason.

01:05.583 --> 01:07.583
I'm really proud of us
for making this work.

01:07.583 --> 01:10.000
And nothing anybody
can do or say

01:10.000 --> 01:12.583
will get in the way
of our friendship.

01:12.583 --> 01:14.708
Yo, Russo!
I'm back.

01:14.708 --> 01:16.250
Wanna smooch?

01:21.291 --> 01:27.208

02:11.500 --> 02:13.083
Dean.

02:13.083 --> 02:15.458
You're back.
I thought you moved to Ohio.

02:15.458 --> 02:17.500
I moved back to work
for my uncle, the plumber.

02:17.500 --> 02:20.750
Or maybe even my
other uncle, the plumber.

02:20.750 --> 02:23.333
And maybe even my aunt.

02:23.333 --> 02:25.458
Guess what she does.

02:25.458 --> 02:28.583
Based on your shirt that says
"Uncles and Aunt Plumbing,"

02:28.583 --> 02:32.000
I'm gonna go with plumber.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.958
Hey, hey, look who's showing off
with the reading.

02:34.958 --> 02:36.458
I'm Dean.

02:36.458 --> 02:39.208
Um, this is Mason,
my friend,

02:39.208 --> 02:41.875
who's a boy, but
not my boyfriend...

02:41.875 --> 02:45.208
...anymore.
But it's going great.

02:45.208 --> 02:49.000
Sounds complicated.

02:49.000 --> 02:50.875
Maybe what's her face
can explain it to me.

02:50.875 --> 02:53.625
I really can't.
And even if I could,
I wouldn't,

02:53.625 --> 02:56.166
because you refuse
to learn my name.

02:56.166 --> 02:57.875
It's Harper.

02:59.583 --> 03:02.583
So Russo, um...

03:02.583 --> 03:04.708
I'm thinking you and I
should get back together.

03:04.708 --> 03:07.500
Yeah, um...
We need to talk.

03:07.500 --> 03:09.708
Just be right back.
One sec.

03:12.416 --> 03:13.875
Mason.

03:13.875 --> 03:16.875
What's going on?
That's Dean Moriarty.

03:16.875 --> 03:18.583
Oh, nothing much.

03:18.583 --> 03:20.875
He sauntered in,
requested to smooch with Alex,

03:20.875 --> 03:22.708
and then suggested
they get back together.

03:22.708 --> 03:24.583
That's gutsy.

03:24.583 --> 03:27.375
That's Dean Moriarty.

03:27.375 --> 03:28.875
It's all right.

03:28.875 --> 03:31.375
Alex and I
are just friends.

03:31.375 --> 03:32.833
Best friends.

03:32.833 --> 03:35.333
Nothing is ever
gonna change that.

03:35.333 --> 03:37.708
Dean, it's really good
to see you,

03:37.708 --> 03:40.000
but I'm kind of in
the friend zone with Mason,

03:40.000 --> 03:41.708
so I'm not really
into dating right now,

03:41.708 --> 03:43.583
but thanks for coming by
and saying hi.

03:43.583 --> 03:46.833
Aw, look, now she's
all over him.

03:46.833 --> 03:49.375
That's Dean Moriarty.

03:49.375 --> 03:52.875
I'm sure she's just brushing
away his filthy dandruff.

03:52.875 --> 03:55.583
He doesn't look clean.

03:55.583 --> 03:59.250
Dude, you rolled around
on a dead squirrel
the other day.

04:10.583 --> 04:14.333
All right, class, let's welcome
our new student, Tyler.

04:15.458 --> 04:17.500
What, no applause?

04:17.500 --> 04:19.458
Hey, I got
kicked out of Wiztech.

04:22.000 --> 04:26.208
Everyone here's been
kicked out of Wiztech.

04:26.208 --> 04:28.458
But we can all get back in

04:28.458 --> 04:30.958
if we do well in my class.

04:30.958 --> 04:33.125
So let's learn
the "Up and Atom" spell.

04:33.125 --> 04:36.291
How about the "Kick Back
and Chill" spell instead?

04:36.291 --> 04:37.875
It goes like this.

04:37.875 --> 04:41.708
Abra-cadabra.

04:43.000 --> 04:45.458
Mr. Justin, I know I'm late,
but I have an excuse.

04:45.458 --> 04:47.458
I got called to Wiztech
to get this note for you.

04:47.458 --> 04:50.458
So really, you're the one
who made me late.

04:50.458 --> 04:52.583
What's your excuse to me?

04:52.583 --> 04:54.833
Please have a seat
next to our new student,

04:54.833 --> 04:56.375
and hand me the note.

04:56.375 --> 04:58.000
Sure.

05:00.291 --> 05:02.583
"Dear Mr. Russo,
thanks to you,

05:02.583 --> 05:04.291
Felix is showing
great progress.

05:04.291 --> 05:05.625
Yesterday, he was even seen

05:05.625 --> 05:07.625
correcting the spelling
on graffiti."

05:07.625 --> 05:10.125
There's no "Z"
in "loser," losers.

05:10.125 --> 05:11.583
"We commend you,

05:11.583 --> 05:13.708
as this will
raise your standings

05:13.708 --> 05:15.583
in your family
wizard competition."

05:15.583 --> 05:18.500
Yes! I am gonna
get back into things.

05:21.416 --> 05:24.625
- Who's he talking to?
- We never know.

05:24.625 --> 05:26.375
"Of course,
to further advance,
you must turn around

05:26.375 --> 05:30.000
the rest of your class.
P.S. We've read your memos

05:30.000 --> 05:33.291
and ask that you
stop calling them
'idiot delinquents.'"

05:36.708 --> 05:40.416
Can you believe Dean
wants to get back together?

05:40.416 --> 05:41.958
We broke up a year ago,

05:41.958 --> 05:43.416
which is like
seven years for you

05:43.416 --> 05:44.458
'cause you live in dog years.

05:44.458 --> 05:46.166
Yeah, I know.

05:46.166 --> 05:49.625
As if you'd ever get back with
someone who said, "Yo, Russo."

05:51.708 --> 05:53.708
Mason.

05:53.708 --> 05:55.708
Rose petals?

05:55.708 --> 05:57.708
What did you do?
We're supposed to be friends.

05:57.708 --> 05:59.208
Those aren't from me.

05:59.208 --> 06:02.375
But I have my suspicions.

06:02.375 --> 06:06.083
Hey, yo, Russo.
You like my flowers?

06:09.208 --> 06:10.375
Suspicions confirmed.

06:15.875 --> 06:17.583
Dean, what is this?

06:17.583 --> 06:19.875
You, uh, remember our
second favorite activity?

06:19.875 --> 06:23.958
Let me guess,
the first was smooching?

06:23.958 --> 06:28.208
No, it was working on
my dad's car in the basement.

06:28.208 --> 06:30.333
Which, now that
I think about it,

06:30.333 --> 06:31.625
often led to smooching.

06:33.000 --> 06:35.250
So what do ya say?
You wanna throw a few?

06:35.250 --> 06:37.583
I'm sure London Bridges
doesn't mind, right?

06:37.583 --> 06:39.625
No, by all means.

06:39.625 --> 06:42.583
We're all friends here.
I insist.

06:48.250 --> 06:51.708
Ten? You lost
your touch, Russo.

06:51.708 --> 06:54.458
No, I haven't.
Give me another
one of those.

06:54.458 --> 06:55.708
I'm about to beat
your high score.

06:55.708 --> 06:58.708
Whoo! There's the Russo
I know. Bring it on.

07:00.375 --> 07:01.833
Yes!

07:01.833 --> 07:05.583
Hey, I'll just be over here
watching you two hit it off.

07:18.125 --> 07:20.458
Can you see me?

07:20.458 --> 07:22.875
Yeah, we see you,
Mr. Justin.

07:22.875 --> 07:25.458
You're all
little and dainty.

07:25.458 --> 07:27.166
Good job on the spell, Felix.

07:27.166 --> 07:29.875
Now, you're gonna need to use
the reverse "Up and Atom" spell

07:29.875 --> 07:31.583
to make me big again.

07:32.958 --> 07:34.416
What's up,
idiot delinquents?

07:35.583 --> 07:37.708
That's what my brother
calls you, not me.

07:39.458 --> 07:41.583
Ah, what's in the microscope?

07:43.000 --> 07:46.458
Ah, the old "Up and Atom" spell.
That's a good one.

07:46.458 --> 07:49.208
Is that Max Russo,
the future family wizard?

07:49.208 --> 07:52.708
- Yeah, he's good.
- No, he's not!

07:52.708 --> 07:54.958
You need to stop saying
he's gonna be the family wizard.

07:54.958 --> 07:56.708
Max, get me out of here.

08:00.291 --> 08:02.166
Hey, hey, careful!

08:02.166 --> 08:03.958
The glass is slippery.

08:06.458 --> 08:08.958
Proton, neutron, back to one.

08:12.333 --> 08:13.333
Thank you.

08:14.500 --> 08:17.166
How are you guys
ever gonna learn spells

08:17.166 --> 08:19.000
if you don't stop
messing around?

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
Don't you want to
get back into WizTech?

08:21.000 --> 08:24.500
I know I want to get back into
my family's wizard competition.

08:24.500 --> 08:27.708
So, if you'd just do a couple
things for me, concentrate,

08:27.708 --> 08:29.708
and listen to what I say,
we will be one step closer

08:29.708 --> 08:32.625
to never, ever having to
see each other, ever again!

08:35.083 --> 08:36.583
I don't know why
I came in here,

08:36.583 --> 08:38.833
but after that show,
I'm glad I did.

08:46.375 --> 08:48.000
I think you're right, Max.

08:48.000 --> 08:51.000
Alex still has feelings
for Dean.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.125
I'm sorry, buddy.

08:53.125 --> 08:54.375
If it makes you
feel any better,

08:54.375 --> 08:56.375
I think he has
feelings for her, too.

09:01.166 --> 09:04.708
What are we doing?

09:09.750 --> 09:11.458
Nine hundred
and thirty points!

09:11.458 --> 09:13.333
Take a seat because
I own this game.

09:13.333 --> 09:15.708
I'm gonna go get us
some refreshments.

09:15.708 --> 09:17.000
Then, it's a rematch.

09:17.000 --> 09:18.166
Fine.

09:19.458 --> 09:23.291
Oh, my goodness!

09:23.291 --> 09:25.500
What is this, skeeball?

09:25.500 --> 09:26.500
Can we play?

09:26.500 --> 09:28.875
No. Dean pushed it 25 blocks

09:28.875 --> 09:30.375
so the two of us
could play together.

09:30.375 --> 09:32.708
That question was just
a courtesy, sweetie.

09:32.708 --> 09:34.875
We're your parents.
We can do whatever we want.

09:36.208 --> 09:37.458
Here, Harper.
Hold this.

09:37.458 --> 09:40.291
OK, loser puts
the groceries away.

09:40.291 --> 09:42.250
Wait, I have to pay
and carry 'em?

09:44.875 --> 09:48.500
So, what does Mason think
about all this?

09:48.500 --> 09:51.625
Mason? Oh, he's...
He's fine with it.

09:51.625 --> 09:54.291
Friends don't mind
when friends

09:54.291 --> 09:56.875
play skeeball in
the middle of the street.

09:59.708 --> 10:01.416
What was that?

10:01.416 --> 10:02.750
I think it was lightning.

10:06.083 --> 10:08.750
What was that growl,
and flash,

10:08.750 --> 10:10.583
and why are you a werewolf?

10:10.583 --> 10:13.708
Alex, the coolest thing
just happened.

10:13.708 --> 10:16.458
I mean, I think it's cool,
but you might not.

10:17.583 --> 10:22.250
Mason?

10:28.000 --> 10:29.333
I ate Dean.

10:35.125 --> 10:38.083
Mason, you can't just
go around eating people!

10:38.083 --> 10:39.833
This isn't...
This isn't...

10:39.833 --> 10:41.708
What place am I
trying to think of, Harper?

10:41.708 --> 10:43.583
No place!

10:43.583 --> 10:47.208
There's no place where you can
just go around eating people!

10:47.208 --> 10:49.000
- I'm sorry.
- You're sorry?!

10:49.000 --> 10:50.708
How could you do this?

10:50.708 --> 10:54.333
Well, it was easy because...

10:54.333 --> 10:56.375
His hair was greasy,

10:56.375 --> 10:59.166
and then he kinda got stuck
at the shoulders.

10:59.166 --> 11:01.250
Yeah, then this guy
started choking,

11:01.250 --> 11:04.250
so I just shrunk Dean down
and made him easier to eat.

11:06.166 --> 11:07.875
Alex, I'm sorry.

11:07.875 --> 11:10.000
I saw how well you were
getting along with Dean,

11:10.000 --> 11:12.750
and I guess I got
a little jealous.

11:12.750 --> 11:16.875
That doesn't mean
you can eat him!

11:28.291 --> 11:31.000
Justin! Justin,
we need your help.
Mason ate Dean.

11:31.000 --> 11:32.958
Not now, Alex. I'm trying
to get through to my class.

11:32.958 --> 11:34.083
He ate Dean!?

11:34.083 --> 11:36.208
The hairy guy ate somebody?

11:36.208 --> 11:37.833
Yeah, he's a werewolf.

11:37.833 --> 11:40.375
- Nice!
- Justin, please,

11:40.375 --> 11:42.375
we need to figure out a way
to get Dean out of Mason.

11:42.375 --> 11:43.875
Let's cut him open.

11:43.875 --> 11:46.250
Let's not cut him open.

11:46.250 --> 11:48.125
He's a very nice guy.

11:48.125 --> 11:49.875
Nice guy?
You ate somebody!

11:49.875 --> 11:53.458
Dudes, let's all shrink down

11:53.458 --> 11:55.583
with that "Up and Atom" spell,
go inside him,

11:55.583 --> 11:58.833
and then bounce around
in his stomach
until he barfs up Dean.

11:58.833 --> 12:01.625
OK, next.

12:01.625 --> 12:04.083
No, no, wait, Tyler might be
onto something here.

12:04.083 --> 12:06.208
Sweet.

12:06.208 --> 12:07.958
Yes, Alex, Max and I
will shrink down

12:07.958 --> 12:10.625
and go in Mason's stomach.
We're gonna need some sort of...

12:10.625 --> 12:13.125
Some sort of fully-functional,
miniature submarine.

12:13.125 --> 12:16.875
I know where we can get one.

12:18.583 --> 12:20.750
No!

12:20.750 --> 12:22.416
Not my Captain
Jim Bob Sherwood

12:22.416 --> 12:24.291
Fully-Functional
Country Cow Submarine.

12:24.291 --> 12:26.958
If I open it,
it'll be worth nothing.

12:26.958 --> 12:28.583
- Justin.
- No.

12:28.583 --> 12:31.375
Going inside Mason's body

12:31.375 --> 12:34.875
would be
the greatest adventure
anyone could ever have.

12:34.875 --> 12:37.333
Jim Bob would
jump at the chance.

12:39.000 --> 12:42.583
You... are right.

12:45.625 --> 12:49.125
This is a
Captain Jim Bob job.

12:49.125 --> 12:51.333
Oh!

12:53.000 --> 12:56.125
Ooh!

12:56.125 --> 12:57.708
Smells new.

13:03.333 --> 13:04.833
I still don't understand

13:04.833 --> 13:07.333
why a submarine crew
has to dress like cows.

13:07.333 --> 13:11.166
Cows? I thought
we were dalmatians.

13:11.166 --> 13:13.833
Now it's just weird.

13:13.833 --> 13:18.583
Country Cow Submarine.
What a crew.

13:18.583 --> 13:20.875
OK, I've turned
the Abracadoodler

13:20.875 --> 13:23.208
into a submarine tracking
sonar scope.

13:23.208 --> 13:24.750
Oh, perfect.

13:24.750 --> 13:27.375
I can't wait to not know
what to use this for.

13:27.375 --> 13:29.125
This is where
you're going to

13:29.125 --> 13:30.875
track where we are
in Mason's body.

13:30.875 --> 13:33.458
Then you're gonna tell us
where we are.

13:33.458 --> 13:35.000
OK, class...

13:36.500 --> 13:38.000
I believe in you.

13:38.000 --> 13:40.583
You're going to
combine your powers,
cast the spell,

13:40.583 --> 13:42.458
and then shrink us down
into the submarine.

13:42.458 --> 13:44.958
Mason. Then you
are going to swallow us.

13:44.958 --> 13:48.458
You're gonna swallow us.
You are not going to chew us.

13:48.458 --> 13:49.458
Got it.

13:49.458 --> 13:52.958
Make me proud, you guys.

13:52.958 --> 13:56.000
This is a...
A really big moment.

13:56.000 --> 13:59.083
So, should I not return,
I want you to remember me

13:59.083 --> 14:02.500
as someone who was very strong,
yet relatably soft.

14:02.500 --> 14:04.708
OK, just, please,
please, please.

14:04.708 --> 14:07.583
Just do the spell
so we can save Dean.

14:07.583 --> 14:10.458
Proton,
neutron, get gone.

14:13.208 --> 14:15.166
- Yes!
- Whoa!

14:15.166 --> 14:17.500
We got the spell right!
What do we do next?

14:17.500 --> 14:20.625
I don't know, I'm still trying
to figure all this stuff out.

14:20.625 --> 14:22.875
I know. I swallow it.

14:24.333 --> 14:26.708
Now this is a
really big moment.

14:26.708 --> 14:28.583
And if anything
happens to me after I...

14:28.583 --> 14:30.208
Just swallow it!

14:37.000 --> 14:42.083
I see 'em! They're in.

14:42.083 --> 14:44.333
Yes! It's working!

14:44.333 --> 14:46.458
Can you guys hear me?

14:46.458 --> 14:48.000
Yes, Mother Hen.

14:48.000 --> 14:51.166
We're in his throat,
passing his uvula. Out.

14:51.166 --> 14:52.625
Mother Hen?

14:52.625 --> 14:54.583
That's her call sign name.

14:54.583 --> 14:57.125
No questioning the captain.

14:57.125 --> 15:00.500
Darn, I should have
worn my hen hat.

15:00.500 --> 15:03.000
Mother Hen,
please get a dictionary

15:03.000 --> 15:06.000
and look up the word "uvula."

15:06.000 --> 15:07.708
Over.

15:09.083 --> 15:10.750
Oh, no, the alarm!

15:10.750 --> 15:12.583
- Something's wrong.
- Do what I do.

15:12.583 --> 15:14.125
Hit the snooze!
Hit the snooze!

15:15.291 --> 15:17.750
OK, all right.
Somehow you got off course,

15:17.750 --> 15:20.125
and you're going
towards his head.

15:20.125 --> 15:22.458
Hey, Captain, is anybody
steering this thing?

15:22.458 --> 15:23.625
Hit the reverse thrusters!

15:23.625 --> 15:24.833
Got it.

15:29.333 --> 15:31.708
You hit the windshield wiper.

15:31.708 --> 15:34.083
Then I don't know what
the reverse thrusters are.

15:39.625 --> 15:43.583
We're in his brain.

15:43.583 --> 15:45.875
Mother Hen, Mother Hen,
this is Bravo Johnny.

15:45.875 --> 15:47.458
we need to figure out
a way out of his brain,

15:47.458 --> 15:49.125
and back down to
his stomach now.

15:49.125 --> 15:51.000
Oh, I know which way to go.

15:51.000 --> 15:53.583
The stomach bone's
connected to the...

15:53.583 --> 15:55.416
Oh, what's the stomach bone
connected to?

15:57.708 --> 15:59.458
Wait, wait, wait.
What was that?

15:59.458 --> 16:02.000
Those are all images of
what he's thinking about.

16:02.000 --> 16:05.166
My gosh, really?

16:06.208 --> 16:07.875
They're all of me.

16:10.166 --> 16:12.250
Oh, I should really
wear that top more often.

16:12.250 --> 16:14.416
That's cute.

16:17.875 --> 16:20.750
Mason is so sweet.

16:20.750 --> 16:23.291
He's always
thinking about me.

16:25.750 --> 16:29.208
OK, it looks like you guys
got out. Make a left.

16:29.208 --> 16:31.291
- No, a right.
- Go up.

16:31.291 --> 16:33.958
Hey, hey, I'm the Mother Hen
here. Back off!

16:33.958 --> 16:37.250
All right, there's a vein that
will take you to his heart.

16:37.250 --> 16:38.875
Then you can transfer to a
big artery in his stomach.

16:38.875 --> 16:40.125
Got it.

16:40.125 --> 16:43.000
Max, stop turning on
the windshield wipers!

16:43.000 --> 16:44.416
Not again.

16:47.000 --> 16:48.416
We're passing through
his heart!

16:48.416 --> 16:51.291
I can't hear you!
We're passing through his heart!

16:51.291 --> 16:52.458
Can you stop yelling?

16:52.458 --> 16:54.625
I'm trying to listen
to the drumbeat!

16:55.750 --> 16:56.958
Oh, my...

16:59.291 --> 17:02.166
We made it.
We're in his stomach.

17:02.166 --> 17:04.000
There it is.
There's Dean!

17:06.416 --> 17:08.875
OK, let's maneuver the sub
carefully over to him.

17:08.875 --> 17:12.500
- Got it.
- Come on, Max!

17:13.875 --> 17:15.708
Wait a minute.

17:15.708 --> 17:18.583
It's actually working.
We're getting closer to him.

17:18.583 --> 17:19.875
See? I know
what I'm doing

17:19.875 --> 17:21.583
even when I don't know
what I'm doing.

17:23.083 --> 17:26.083
Easy... easy...
Stop.

17:26.083 --> 17:29.166
Open the transfer tube,
I'll pull him in.

17:39.000 --> 17:42.500
OK, he's out cold,
but he's still breathing.

17:42.500 --> 17:46.000
And that's how you do
a Captain Jim Bob job.

17:47.708 --> 17:49.458
What is he covered in?

17:51.708 --> 17:53.000
Tastes like oatmeal.

17:53.000 --> 17:56.000
Yeah, Mason and I
had that for breakfast.

17:56.000 --> 17:59.208
Here, open the hatch.
I wanna go diving for raisins.

17:59.208 --> 18:02.166
Those aren't
raisins, bro.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.750
Harper, get us out of here
before Dean wakes up.

18:06.750 --> 18:10.291
OK, friendly reminder, I still
don't know what I'm doing.

18:10.291 --> 18:11.416
Just tell Mason to burp,

18:11.416 --> 18:13.125
and tell Felix to catch
whatever comes out.

18:13.125 --> 18:15.708
Man! So lucky.

18:25.208 --> 18:29.000
Cool! I think one of these
burp pieces is them.

18:31.416 --> 18:33.958
OK, come on, class.
You know the spell
to bring us back.

18:36.083 --> 18:39.125
Come on, guys. I know
we can do this. Ready?

18:39.125 --> 18:42.250
Proton, neutron,
back to one.

18:45.833 --> 18:47.625
You guys did it!

18:47.625 --> 18:49.583
You did the spell exactly
how you were supposed to!

18:49.583 --> 18:52.875
That's right.
That's right, we did.

18:52.875 --> 18:56.333
You just wiped burp
all over me.

18:56.333 --> 18:58.208
Yeah, kinda.

18:58.208 --> 19:01.125
Alex, you made it back.
I was worried about you.

19:01.125 --> 19:03.083
I know you were.

19:03.083 --> 19:05.708
Uh-oh, it looks like
Dean's coming to.

19:05.708 --> 19:07.208
We gotta get him
out of the lair.

19:07.208 --> 19:09.708
Do I have time to make toast
and scrape him clean?

19:15.958 --> 19:20.333
What happened?

19:21.625 --> 19:23.416
What are you guys wearing?

19:25.291 --> 19:27.125
And what am I covered in?

19:29.166 --> 19:31.375
Alex, you got this one,
right?

19:31.375 --> 19:33.416
She lives for these moments.

19:33.416 --> 19:34.708
Simon Says, follow them.

19:38.208 --> 19:41.750
Um... OK,
well, you see...

19:41.750 --> 19:46.000
Dean, you got knocked out
by a flying bowl of oatmeal.

19:46.000 --> 19:48.458
We called the doctor
and he said

19:48.458 --> 19:50.625
the only way to
wake you up was...

19:50.625 --> 19:54.000
...to dress up like cows.

19:54.000 --> 19:57.416
- Really? That's your story?
- Give it a minute.

20:00.625 --> 20:03.125
That's a good doctor.

20:05.166 --> 20:07.583
Look, Russo, I don't know
how long I was out,

20:07.583 --> 20:11.166
but I'm still thinking about
why I came here.

20:11.166 --> 20:12.458
I want us to
get back together.

20:12.458 --> 20:15.458
I... I know you do, Dean.

20:15.458 --> 20:17.458
But I... I can't.

20:18.708 --> 20:21.708
- I have a boyfriend.
- You do?

20:23.166 --> 20:25.708
Yes. You.

20:27.875 --> 20:29.208
I thought
you guys broke up.

20:29.208 --> 20:31.583
Yes, we did.

20:31.583 --> 20:34.125
But... that was
a mistake.

20:34.125 --> 20:37.000
I was afraid of that.

20:37.000 --> 20:39.708
Well, uh, sorry,
London Bridges.

20:39.708 --> 20:40.708
I'll get out of your way.

20:51.083 --> 20:53.458
Alex, I want to be
your boyfriend,

20:53.458 --> 20:55.750
but if you're
gonna be mortal,

20:55.750 --> 20:58.000
we just have to
stay friends.

20:58.000 --> 21:00.875
I can't be just friends.

21:00.875 --> 21:05.333
I think about you
all the time.

21:05.333 --> 21:08.500
I know that you
think about me, too.

21:10.583 --> 21:14.083
So, I'm not
gonna be mortal.

21:14.083 --> 21:15.583
What do you mean?

21:15.583 --> 21:18.708
I'm gonna get back in
the wizard competition,

21:18.708 --> 21:22.333
and I'm gonna win.
For us.

21:22.333 --> 21:25.625
Well, I'd say
that's cause for celebration.

21:26.750 --> 21:29.583
Yo, Russo.
Wanna smooch?

21:32.625 --> 21:34.625
Don't ever say that again.

21:40.875 --> 21:41.875
Oh, yes.

21:41.875 --> 21:43.208
That's all you got,
woman?

21:43.208 --> 21:45.125
That's all I need,
old man.

21:45.125 --> 21:47.458
I'm only two months
older than you.

21:47.458 --> 21:51.625
Mom, Dad, I have some
really exciting news.

21:51.625 --> 21:53.958
I've decided to get back
in the wizard competition.

21:53.958 --> 21:55.583
It's in the drawer
with the dead batteries.

21:55.583 --> 21:57.333
A hundred, Jerry!

21:59.291 --> 22:01.583
Are you even listening?

22:01.583 --> 22:03.875
I'm going to win
the wizard competition

22:03.875 --> 22:06.000
so Mason and I
can be together.

22:06.000 --> 22:07.583
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Great, honey.

22:07.583 --> 22:10.375
Here's 20 dollars.
Take your own candy.

22:11.500 --> 22:14.708
A hundred
and fifty points, Theresa!

22:14.708 --> 22:17.500
Let me try.

22:17.500 --> 22:20.000
I ate Dean today.

22:20.000 --> 22:22.333
What?

22:23.875 --> 22:25.583
He said we're going
to the movies. Bye!
