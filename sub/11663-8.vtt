(mellow music playing)

01:17.800 --> 01:19.333
Ma, what are you doing?

01:19.400 --> 01:21.734
There's a hurricane a-comin'!

01:21.800 --> 01:23.200
A-comin'?

01:24.867 --> 01:25.700
That's right.

01:25.767 --> 01:29.633
People only use the "a-" when a really
big storm is a-comin' or a-brewin',

01:29.700 --> 01:31.333
so grab a sack and start a-shovelin'.

01:34.367 --> 01:38.233
Ma, the weather report said nothing
about a hurricane.

01:38.300 --> 01:42.133
Ida Pearlberg, down at the senior center,
woke up this morning with a leg cramp.

01:42.900 --> 01:44.133
Need I say more?

01:45.934 --> 01:46.800
Yes.

01:46.867 --> 01:49.533
You get around my age, two things happen.

01:49.600 --> 01:51.533
One, you get more intuitive
about the weather,

01:51.600 --> 01:53.900
and two, corn becomes your enemy.

02:00.767 --> 02:04.266
Even if there is a hurricane a-comin'...

02:04.333 --> 02:05.400
Don't patronize me.

02:05.467 --> 02:07.900
I'm not patronizing you.
I'm a-mockin' you.

02:10.133 --> 02:12.367
If there is a hurricane coming,

02:12.433 --> 02:16.300
it won't get here for a while,
so sit down and relax.

02:16.934 --> 02:17.834
Okay.

02:18.900 --> 02:22.333
I'm glad we have this quiet time
before the storm hits,

02:22.400 --> 02:25.467
because there's something
I'd like to tell you.

02:25.533 --> 02:26.400
What, Ma?

02:26.467 --> 02:28.633
I always thought of us as the Gabors.

02:31.467 --> 02:33.734
Well, I'm glad we had this little chat.

02:33.800 --> 02:35.667
No, hear me out.

02:36.300 --> 02:38.233
I'm Jolie, the mother.

02:38.300 --> 02:40.367
Your sister Gloria, she's Zsa Zsa,

02:40.433 --> 02:44.200
and Eva, well, Eva was or course,
your brother Phil.

02:46.567 --> 02:47.667
I'm not a Gabor?

02:47.734 --> 02:48.800
You're telling me.

02:50.367 --> 02:53.166
But, listen, big news,
Zsa Zsa's coming to town.

02:53.233 --> 02:55.033
Gloria is coming here?

02:55.100 --> 02:57.467
I wish I knew
why you two didn't get along.

02:57.533 --> 02:59.233
I just don't understand it.

02:59.300 --> 03:02.100
For some reason, you've always
been jealous of my good daughter.

03:05.033 --> 03:06.700
She makes me crazy.

03:06.767 --> 03:10.133
She's always putting down my way of life,
my choice of career.

03:10.200 --> 03:13.300
She's never been there for me.

03:13.367 --> 03:16.066
All she ever talks about
is how much money she has.

03:16.133 --> 03:20.166
Dorothy,
there's upsetting news, she's broke.

03:20.233 --> 03:23.800
She invested all her money in junk bonds,
and now she's broke.

03:24.467 --> 03:25.667
She has no money?

03:25.734 --> 03:26.600
Not a dime.

03:26.667 --> 03:27.834
Yes!

03:28.934 --> 03:31.934
(light music playing)

03:34.433 --> 03:35.467
(door opens)

03:35.533 --> 03:37.066
Well, this is it.

03:37.400 --> 03:40.133
My last session with Stan
and the psychiatrist.

03:40.200 --> 03:40.867
How do I look?

03:40.934 --> 03:42.367
Oh, fine, why?

03:42.433 --> 03:45.433
It's so hard to dress for a psychiatrist.

03:46.667 --> 03:48.967
You wear black,
they think you're depressed.

03:50.033 --> 03:51.967
You wear red, they think you're angry.

03:52.767 --> 03:55.300
You wear a negligee,
they think you wanna sleep with them.

03:57.700 --> 03:59.567
Why aren't you arrested more?

04:01.834 --> 04:06.633
Dr. Halperin is really working wonders
with Stan.

04:06.700 --> 04:12.033
You know, he's gotten him to transfer
his love for me to a fake monkey.

04:15.100 --> 04:16.600
What are you talking about?

04:16.667 --> 04:18.166
It really is very simple.

04:18.233 --> 04:22.934
You see, studies show when baby monkeys
are taken away from their mothers,

04:23.000 --> 04:26.867
they can transfer their love
to fake mothers.

04:27.367 --> 04:29.300
The same thing is happening with Stan.

04:29.367 --> 04:32.400
He's weaning himself
from his relationship with me

04:32.467 --> 04:35.367
by using a fake monkey for companionship.

04:36.533 --> 04:38.000
Why not use a fake woman?

04:38.066 --> 04:41.567
That's why Stan went to the psychiatrist
in the first place.

04:45.433 --> 04:47.166
Girls, guess what.

04:47.233 --> 04:50.300
You know that
"Save the McKinley Lighthouse" campaign

04:50.367 --> 04:51.200
I've been talking about?

04:51.867 --> 04:53.033
Mmm... no.

04:53.100 --> 04:56.233
I've told you about it 200 times.

04:56.300 --> 04:57.467
No.

04:58.767 --> 05:02.166
Boy, it's like you people
don't pay any attention to me whatsoever.

05:06.967 --> 05:09.000
Hey, when did you sneak in?

05:10.166 --> 05:13.567
Listen, I just got the television station

05:13.633 --> 05:17.367
to give me eight hours of air time
for the telethon.

05:17.433 --> 05:18.900
Rose, that's wonderful.

05:18.967 --> 05:22.166
There's so many things to get organized.

05:22.233 --> 05:24.600
I'll need somebody to help me do this.

05:24.667 --> 05:27.000
Well, sign me up. I'd love to help.

05:27.066 --> 05:28.000
You?

05:28.066 --> 05:31.633
Oh, you'd turn the telethon
into a disgusting manhunt.

05:33.333 --> 05:35.133
A disgusting manhunt...

05:35.934 --> 05:37.300
What a great idea.

05:38.734 --> 05:42.300
Oh. See, we'll all get dressed
in little Safari outfits,

05:42.633 --> 05:45.066
and we'll have the men in cages.

05:45.133 --> 05:49.467
Then we'll let them out,
and they'll all run around in loincloths.

05:51.867 --> 05:55.533
And every man who gets caught
will donate $50.

05:55.600 --> 05:57.367
And then we'll get to take them home
with us.

06:03.266 --> 06:04.400
Well, fine.

06:04.467 --> 06:06.300
Save your own damn lighthouse.

06:09.033 --> 06:09.934
(doorbell chimes)

06:10.000 --> 06:11.367
That's her.

06:11.433 --> 06:12.867
Be nice.

06:12.934 --> 06:14.433
Don't mention she's broke.

06:14.500 --> 06:16.900
Why would I do that? She's my sister.

06:16.967 --> 06:18.934
Besides, I want to hear it from her mouth.

06:21.734 --> 06:23.967
-Dorothy.
-Gloria.

06:25.233 --> 06:27.834
-Ma!
-Gloria!

06:27.900 --> 06:29.233
Oh, my little girl.

06:29.300 --> 06:30.400
I'm sorry I'm late.

06:30.467 --> 06:32.600
Oh, no. I understand.

06:32.667 --> 06:33.600
Buses.

06:36.533 --> 06:37.667
Won't you sit down?

06:37.734 --> 06:39.867
I thought I heard that doorbell.

06:39.934 --> 06:42.867
-Gloria!
-Hi, Blanche. Hi, Rose.

06:43.567 --> 06:46.133
Look at this.
My two little girls at home again.

06:48.200 --> 06:52.533
So, uh, Gloria, I understand you're, uh...

06:52.600 --> 06:54.500
Happier than I've ever been.

06:54.567 --> 06:58.133
It's like I get to completely start over.

06:58.200 --> 06:59.367
Yeah, yeah. Right.

06:59.433 --> 07:02.233
You're starting over
because you've lost all of your...

07:02.300 --> 07:04.500
Constraint. My ties.

07:05.033 --> 07:08.133
I feel like now I can begin to live again.

07:08.200 --> 07:10.066
I can do anything.

07:10.133 --> 07:13.633
I can even do what you d...
What is it you do again?

07:14.934 --> 07:16.467
I'm a substitute teacher.

07:16.533 --> 07:18.467
Oh, no. I'd be a real teacher.

07:20.100 --> 07:21.967
I am a real teacher.

07:22.033 --> 07:23.867
Oh, look, Ma.

07:23.934 --> 07:26.500
Her ears are starting to get all red.

07:26.567 --> 07:29.233
<i>♪ Someone's getting mad ♪</i>

07:29.300 --> 07:32.333
My ears aren't getting red.
You do this every time.

07:32.400 --> 07:34.767
You start pushing my buttons.

07:34.834 --> 07:36.200
Well, it's not going to work.

07:36.266 --> 07:39.000
Hide your pain. I can wait.

07:43.300 --> 07:44.100
So...

07:44.900 --> 07:46.200
You two are sisters.

07:50.266 --> 07:51.467
(doorbell chimes)

07:51.533 --> 07:53.734
That's Stan. Rose, get the door.

07:53.800 --> 07:56.400
Is Stan still as crazy as ever?

07:56.467 --> 07:58.667
As a matter of fact, he's not.

07:58.734 --> 08:00.800
We've been going to a therapist together.

08:00.867 --> 08:03.333
He's making wonderful progress.

08:11.266 --> 08:12.567
Hi. It's me, Stan.

08:13.166 --> 08:16.066
And who's that good-looking monkey
with you?

08:17.500 --> 08:20.867
Don't be condescending.
It's silly, but it's doctor's orders.

08:20.934 --> 08:23.467
It's a tool to help me get over Dorothy.

08:23.533 --> 08:24.467
Can I hold him?

08:24.533 --> 08:25.900
Are your hands clean?

08:27.433 --> 08:28.767
Hello, Stan.

08:28.834 --> 08:30.767
What are you doing here?

08:30.834 --> 08:32.967
You usually don't like slumming it.

08:33.033 --> 08:37.133
Stan, please. She's out of M-O-N-E-Y.

08:39.700 --> 08:41.200
She's not getting mine.

08:41.266 --> 08:44.200
She's not out of monkey.
She's out of money.

08:49.000 --> 08:49.967
Come on, let's go.

08:50.033 --> 08:52.033
(chuckles)
Out of money, is she?

08:52.100 --> 08:53.266
Well, how ironic.

08:53.333 --> 08:55.500
You're broke,
and I have all the money I want,

08:56.166 --> 08:59.533
not to mention my self-respect
and my monkey.

09:01.400 --> 09:03.800
And a good-looking monkey it is.

09:04.867 --> 09:07.033
Is it me, or is that a traffic cone?

09:11.300 --> 09:12.333
Jealous?

09:14.066 --> 09:15.266
Come on, Dorothy.

09:15.333 --> 09:18.166
After our session, I have a dinner meeting
with some investors.

09:18.233 --> 09:21.100
Oh, my God, Stan.
You're not taking your monkey?

09:21.767 --> 09:24.200
Please. They are Japanese investors.

09:24.266 --> 09:26.500
The last thing I'd do is offend them.

09:26.567 --> 09:28.834
She'll be at a separate table
with the other wives.

09:33.300 --> 09:36.767
No, no, Mrs. Gutman,
honestly, there's no hurricane coming.

09:37.100 --> 09:40.367
Yes, yes, I heard about Ida Pearlberg.

09:41.900 --> 09:44.266
She's 5'2" and weighs 200 pounds,

09:44.333 --> 09:46.533
I'd be shocked
if she didn't have leg cramps.

09:48.333 --> 09:51.000
No, Mrs. Gutman,
I'm not making fun of you.

09:53.433 --> 09:55.133
Good, well, I'll see you Tuesday.

09:55.200 --> 09:56.934
Fine, if there is a Tuesday.

09:58.633 --> 10:00.200
Sorry for the interruptions.

10:00.266 --> 10:03.233
Every 80-year-old in the city
has gone berserk.

10:04.000 --> 10:06.200
What can you say?
There are some sick people out there.

10:06.266 --> 10:07.300
(chuckles)

10:08.367 --> 10:09.266
(clears throat)

10:10.333 --> 10:13.834
Uh, by the way,
will my monkey be okay on my lap,

10:13.900 --> 10:14.867
or should I get a chair?

10:14.934 --> 10:17.400
I have a place for your monkey.

10:20.600 --> 10:23.667
Dorothy, it sounds like
you're a little hostile toward the monkey.

10:23.734 --> 10:24.934
Want to talk about it?

10:25.000 --> 10:25.967
What's to talk about?

10:26.033 --> 10:29.800
I had to ride in the back seat
all the way over.

10:30.500 --> 10:33.233
Stan said the monkey called shotgun.

10:34.600 --> 10:38.633
Dorothy, I don't think you'd feel this way
if you'd read my book monkey love.

10:42.867 --> 10:44.667
Stan came to me as a needy person.

10:44.734 --> 10:47.567
I've shown him he can be happy
with an inanimate object.

10:47.900 --> 10:50.166
You're now independent.

10:50.233 --> 10:51.233
You don't need this monkey.

10:51.300 --> 10:53.900
Wait. You're not thinking
about taking away Fifi?

10:55.934 --> 10:57.100
Maybe I jumped the gun.

10:58.200 --> 11:01.700
Not having read monkey love, doctor,

11:01.767 --> 11:04.600
how many of your patients
don't get off the monkey?

11:04.667 --> 11:05.500
Over half.

11:07.266 --> 11:08.934
But the monkey keeps getting smaller

11:09.000 --> 11:11.533
until, ultimately,
it's the size of a key chain.

11:14.133 --> 11:16.934
Dorothy, you and Stan say your goodbyes.

11:17.000 --> 11:18.734
Stan, can you return tomorrow?

11:18.800 --> 11:21.000
Well, we were thinking
about playing bridge.

11:21.066 --> 11:22.467
Oh, Stanley, stop that!

11:24.100 --> 11:27.033
Dorothy, in any event,
your part here is done.

11:27.100 --> 11:31.300
I recommend as the concluding
and most important step in your treatment

11:31.367 --> 11:33.166
that you spend two years apart.

11:33.233 --> 11:36.533
No phone calls, no visits, nothing.

11:37.233 --> 11:38.233
That okay?

11:38.300 --> 11:39.400
Oh, yeah.

11:41.133 --> 11:42.467
I'll try.
(clears throat)

11:42.533 --> 11:45.967
Say what's on your minds
and in your hearts.

11:46.033 --> 11:46.700
Okay.

11:48.200 --> 11:52.100
Well, Dorothy,
I'm sorry this couldn't work out.

11:52.633 --> 11:58.166
Thank you for 38 years of love
and friendship and memories.

11:58.233 --> 12:00.066
I'll cherish them always.

12:01.734 --> 12:02.567
Stan...

12:03.934 --> 12:04.600
Ciao.

12:11.166 --> 12:14.867
(mellow music playing)

12:16.367 --> 12:18.233
You're back from your session early.

12:18.300 --> 12:20.467
Was it as cathartic as you thought?

12:20.533 --> 12:23.767
Well, I don't know
if cathartic is the word.

12:24.266 --> 12:25.800
You should do what I do.

12:25.867 --> 12:29.133
I find that if I repeat a word
that's confused me,

12:29.200 --> 12:31.500
I look smarter than I really am.

12:34.333 --> 12:36.166
Like, "Was it cathartic?

12:36.233 --> 12:38.367
Oh, I've had a catharticism.

12:38.433 --> 12:42.033
Of course I'm not the type
to kiss and catharterize".

12:45.066 --> 12:47.100
I tell you, I am still stunned.

12:47.166 --> 12:51.467
I just can't get over
that Stan is gone forever.

12:51.533 --> 12:53.166
I'm finally free.

12:53.233 --> 12:53.900
Really?

12:53.967 --> 12:56.100
And I feel great.

12:56.166 --> 12:58.800
As a matter of fact, a toast.

12:58.867 --> 13:00.033
Okay.

13:01.300 --> 13:04.133
To finality and closure.

13:04.934 --> 13:08.467
To husbands being out of our lives
and gone forever.

13:09.200 --> 13:10.333
Ohh.

13:10.400 --> 13:12.133
Dorothy!

13:12.200 --> 13:14.467
No, wait. Wait. This is good.

13:14.533 --> 13:16.467
Why are you crying?

13:16.533 --> 13:19.367
Our husbands are dead, you monster.

13:21.333 --> 13:22.633
I'm sorry.

13:22.700 --> 13:24.800
I mean, I didn't mean it that way.

13:24.867 --> 13:26.600
Come on now. Let's celebrate.

13:26.667 --> 13:30.166
You don't know what it's like
having a husband die,

13:30.233 --> 13:31.233
leaving you with nothing.

13:31.767 --> 13:33.567
Just a closet full of suits

13:33.633 --> 13:36.934
that you spend the rest of your life
trying to get rid of.

13:38.400 --> 13:40.600
What are you anyway, a 42 regular?

13:44.333 --> 13:46.934
Look, I'm sorry if I seemed insensitive,

13:47.734 --> 13:49.033
but in every relationship,

13:49.100 --> 13:51.633
there are always times
when you don't want to be with each other.

13:51.700 --> 13:53.633
Stan and I went through a period

13:53.700 --> 13:56.600
where we had no marital relations at all.

13:56.667 --> 13:58.834
I totally cut off his sex.

13:58.900 --> 14:00.433
You mean it grows back?

14:16.533 --> 14:18.467
Yes, Rose. He's a lizard.

14:20.734 --> 14:23.533
I mean, we stopped having sex.

14:23.600 --> 14:25.600
I could never do that.

14:25.667 --> 14:27.700
Oh, big surprise.

14:28.533 --> 14:30.667
I'm amazed you're taking a break now.

14:32.100 --> 14:34.800
All right,
leaving your husbands out of this,

14:34.867 --> 14:38.200
haven't you ever been glad
when one of your relationships ended?

14:38.266 --> 14:40.600
How about that guy you dated last summer?

14:40.667 --> 14:44.300
Don't you remember,
the one who played goofy at Disney world?

14:45.800 --> 14:48.066
I remember the passion, yes.

14:48.767 --> 14:50.900
Remember why it didn't work?

14:50.967 --> 14:51.834
It just didn't.

14:51.900 --> 14:54.967
-Right, but why not?
-I don't want to discuss it.

14:55.033 --> 14:57.567
There's nothing to be ashamed of.

14:58.266 --> 15:00.200
He took off the goofy head.

15:10.500 --> 15:12.667
He took off the goofy head.

15:13.300 --> 15:14.066
See?

15:14.133 --> 15:15.600
That's not so bad.

15:23.533 --> 15:25.967
Hurricane supplies. Coming through.

15:26.033 --> 15:28.967
What makes you so certain about the storm?

15:29.033 --> 15:30.800
Because I'm old. I know.

15:30.867 --> 15:33.834
I've seen everything twice,
except bonfire of the vanities.

15:33.900 --> 15:34.633
Woof.

15:36.533 --> 15:41.166
Ma, I just got back from my session,
and I've got some great news.

15:41.233 --> 15:42.834
Ma, it's over.

15:43.266 --> 15:47.066
He is gone.
He is out of our lives forever.

15:47.600 --> 15:48.867
Yeah. Forever.

15:48.934 --> 15:51.533
Forever, like my husband Sal.

15:52.000 --> 15:52.734
(whimpers)

15:52.800 --> 15:55.500
What is everyone's problem around here?

15:55.567 --> 15:58.033
Ma, I'm talking about Stan.

15:58.100 --> 15:59.500
I feel renewed.

15:59.567 --> 16:03.000
I feel like a weight's
been lifted off my shoulders.

16:03.500 --> 16:06.367
Maybe you should share
some of that happiness with your sister.

16:06.834 --> 16:08.934
We just don't get along.

16:09.000 --> 16:11.433
You're family. You should force yourself.

16:11.500 --> 16:12.433
She needs you.

16:12.500 --> 16:13.166
(door opens)

16:13.834 --> 16:15.033
Oh.

16:15.100 --> 16:16.200
Dorothy...

16:16.266 --> 16:18.834
Gloria, hello.
We were just talking about you.

16:20.033 --> 16:20.834
How are you?

16:21.300 --> 16:22.767
(crying)

16:22.834 --> 16:25.667
Oh, nice going, Dorothy.

16:27.200 --> 16:29.133
I asked her how she was doing.

16:29.200 --> 16:31.467
It's not like I mentioned
her dead husband.

16:31.533 --> 16:34.033
(all sobbing)

16:45.567 --> 16:47.767
Gloria, you okay?

16:48.934 --> 16:51.200
I just had a bad day.
(chuckles)

16:51.266 --> 16:53.133
I guess I'm a little scared.

16:53.800 --> 16:57.633
Maybe I was too confident when I got here,

16:57.700 --> 17:00.400
trying to convince myself I was happy.

17:01.433 --> 17:02.333
I guess I'm...

17:02.800 --> 17:04.266
really lonely.

17:04.333 --> 17:06.500
Oh, Gloria, I understand.

17:06.567 --> 17:09.166
Oh, I know you understand, Dorothy.

17:09.233 --> 17:10.767
That's why I came to you.

17:13.800 --> 17:16.533
I'm miserable, with no prospects...

17:17.266 --> 17:19.367
Oh, Dorothy, how do you do it?

17:19.433 --> 17:21.700
Day after day. Year after year.

17:22.300 --> 17:23.000
(sighs)

17:24.734 --> 17:26.834
I feel lost.

17:27.300 --> 17:30.000
Well, I mean, look, you're in a new city.

17:30.066 --> 17:31.700
You're poor.

17:32.166 --> 17:33.500
You're a single woman.

17:33.567 --> 17:34.734
You have no money.

17:34.800 --> 17:38.467
-I know.
-I mean, you're poor.

17:38.533 --> 17:40.233
Every last cent is gone.

17:40.300 --> 17:41.533
No <i>mas dinero</i>.

17:41.600 --> 17:43.066
Dorothy.

17:43.133 --> 17:46.200
But I'm your sister, and I'm here for you.

17:49.834 --> 17:54.166
I guess I've just been feeling sorry
for myself, thinking...

17:54.233 --> 17:58.266
I'm all alone,
no one loves me, poor Gloria.

17:58.333 --> 17:59.433
Literally.

18:02.333 --> 18:03.934
All right, I'll tell you what.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.233
Right now, you're lonely.

18:06.300 --> 18:07.667
You're disoriented.

18:07.734 --> 18:09.700
Maybe you need a little distraction.

18:09.767 --> 18:11.900
I'll introduce you to some men.

18:11.967 --> 18:12.700
Ho!

18:15.700 --> 18:16.767
(laughs)

18:16.834 --> 18:18.367
No, I'm sorry.

18:18.433 --> 18:19.867
Good... Good idea.

18:19.934 --> 18:21.834
You, Dorothy, can intro...

18:21.900 --> 18:23.867
(cackles)

18:25.633 --> 18:28.300
Can introduce Gloria to... to...

18:28.367 --> 18:29.033
Men.

18:29.100 --> 18:31.900
(laughs)

18:31.967 --> 18:34.266
Oh, gosh, that feels good.

18:36.867 --> 18:39.967
Listen, um, I'm sorry for crying.

18:40.033 --> 18:41.033
Me, too.

18:48.400 --> 18:52.734
<i>♪ But how can you thank someone ♪</i>

18:52.800 --> 18:57.166
<i>♪ Who's taken you</i>
<i>From crayons to perfume ♪</i>

18:58.300 --> 19:05.300
<i>♪ It isn't easy, but I'll try ♪</i>

19:05.367 --> 19:08.066
To sir, with love.

19:08.133 --> 19:12.600
Oh, bravo! Bravissimo!
Encore! Encore! Date me.

19:14.400 --> 19:15.500
Blanche.

19:16.233 --> 19:17.767
Well, he was good.

19:17.834 --> 19:20.300
He was not. He was just a man.

19:20.367 --> 19:24.567
You've said yes to all the men
and discriminated against the women.

19:24.633 --> 19:28.567
It just so happens
all the women have been horrible.

19:28.633 --> 19:32.533

19:32.900 --> 19:33.967
<i>♪ The... ♪</i>

19:34.033 --> 19:35.367
Thank you.

19:43.166 --> 19:44.033
Hi, girls.

19:44.100 --> 19:45.066
How's it going?

19:45.133 --> 19:47.100
Angelo, what are you doing here?

19:47.166 --> 19:48.967
My brother's trying out for the telethon.

19:49.000 --> 19:51.033
I got a song I used to sing
with my partner.

19:51.100 --> 19:53.300
We call ourself Tino and Fino.

19:53.767 --> 19:56.367
No political stuff. We don't want trouble.

19:56.433 --> 19:57.166
Yeah.

19:58.133 --> 20:00.166
Uh, where's Fino?

20:00.533 --> 20:04.767
Uh, Fino is... Well, uh... <i>Finito</i>.

20:05.433 --> 20:09.133
He was killed quite ironically
in a banana-packing plant.

20:10.266 --> 20:11.934
Why was that ironical?

20:12.000 --> 20:15.734
Excuse me.
I must have made a mistake in my English.

20:15.800 --> 20:18.200
It was quite comical.

20:19.400 --> 20:20.867
I got to go limber up.

20:20.934 --> 20:23.000
Dorothy, I need to talk to you.

20:23.066 --> 20:24.066
Why, of course.

20:24.133 --> 20:25.567
-(sighs)
-What's up?

20:25.934 --> 20:27.467
Listen, maybe it's me.

20:27.533 --> 20:29.867
Maybe I'm too critical,

20:29.934 --> 20:32.834
but you know how you've been
fixing me up with men?

20:32.900 --> 20:34.400
-Ho!
-Ma!

20:36.533 --> 20:38.500
You haven't had a good time.

20:38.567 --> 20:40.900
Maybe you shouldn't be with strangers.

20:40.967 --> 20:45.033
You should be with family and friends,
people you know.

20:45.100 --> 20:46.200
You know, you're right.

20:46.266 --> 20:47.500
That would help.

20:47.567 --> 20:50.834
Right now,
my life feels like one frightening,

20:50.900 --> 20:53.900
gaping maw ready to consume me.

20:54.400 --> 20:55.667
Did you ever feel like that?

20:55.734 --> 20:59.600
Every day, and then something changed.

20:59.667 --> 21:01.266
I made friends.

21:01.333 --> 21:02.667
I found support.

21:02.734 --> 21:04.367
And, of course, I had Ma.

21:04.934 --> 21:07.233
Frightening, gaping Ma.

21:07.300 --> 21:09.233
(laughs)

21:10.166 --> 21:13.767
You know something?
It's kind of nice having a sister around.

21:13.834 --> 21:17.600
Why don't we put ma back in her room,
and you can room with me?

21:18.033 --> 21:21.300
We'll get to know each other again.

21:22.400 --> 21:24.367
I think that would be wonderful.

21:24.433 --> 21:25.166
Aw.

21:25.233 --> 21:26.834
(Gloria laughs)

21:33.834 --> 21:35.467
Gee, I wonder where Gloria is.

21:35.533 --> 21:38.700
I was thinking of surprising her,
inviting her to lunch.

21:38.767 --> 21:41.367
All of a sudden, you're best friends?

21:41.433 --> 21:43.233
Well, maybe I've changed.

21:43.300 --> 21:45.734
For once, everything is going well.

21:45.800 --> 21:47.200
My sister's in my life.

21:47.266 --> 21:49.300
Stan's out of my life.

21:49.367 --> 21:51.800
I won't see him for two whole years.

21:51.867 --> 21:53.033
Everything is perfect.

21:53.100 --> 21:56.033
Hush, pussycat. Ida's ankles
are swelled up like a blowfish.

21:56.100 --> 21:57.500
Let's see about the hurricane.

21:58.867 --> 22:01.867
(news man) <i>To repeat,</i>
<i>South Florida's under a hurricane watch.</i>

22:01.934 --> 22:04.667
<i>We'll keep tracking the storm</i>
<i>to see if it comes our way.</i>

22:05.233 --> 22:06.600
I can't believe it.

22:06.667 --> 22:08.266
The eastern seaboard's history.

22:08.667 --> 22:10.500
God, it feels good to be right.

22:10.567 --> 22:11.600
(chuckles)

22:11.667 --> 22:15.233
I'm not letting any bad news
affect me today.

22:15.300 --> 22:17.600
I am in control of my fate.

22:17.667 --> 22:19.166
For once in her life,

22:19.233 --> 22:22.934
Dorothy Zbornak is the master
of her own destiny.

22:23.000 --> 22:24.266
I am woman.

22:24.333 --> 22:25.667
Hear me roar.

22:31.567 --> 22:33.066
Aah!

22:37.500 --> 22:38.567
Dorothy.

22:38.633 --> 22:39.667
Gloria.

22:40.033 --> 22:41.300
Stan.

22:41.367 --> 22:42.834
Good news, Dorothy.

22:42.900 --> 22:43.967
I'm off the monkey.

22:50.200 --> 22:51.734
Oh, my God.

22:52.400 --> 22:53.900
I can't believe it.

22:54.567 --> 22:55.900
I feel light-headed.

22:56.767 --> 22:58.166
I think I'm gonna...

22:58.233 --> 22:59.266
I'm gonna...

23:02.600 --> 23:03.700
No, I'm okay.

23:05.333 --> 23:08.333
(mellow music playing)

23:11.133 --> 23:14.133
(closing theme music playing)
