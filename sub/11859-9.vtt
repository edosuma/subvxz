WEBVTT

00:56.166 --> 00:57.834
Look at me, Rita.

00:57.917 --> 00:59.750
How about a little more
sunshine on the goodies, huh?

00:59.834 --> 01:02.166
Zip! Men like
to imagine, not see.

01:02.250 --> 01:03.458
Not this man.

01:03.542 --> 01:05.291
You ain't seeing nothing
tonight, you keep it up.

01:05.375 --> 01:07.792
Oh...Betty, fix that sleeve.

01:07.875 --> 01:09.333
There's nothing's wrong
with it, Zip.

01:09.417 --> 01:10.917
Just move it up an inch.

01:12.375 --> 01:14.583
- Yeah, like that.
- Big difference.

01:14.667 --> 01:17.250
Hey, hey, hey, every detail
matters in one of my pin-ups.

01:17.333 --> 01:18.792
That's why
Monty knows I'm the best.

01:18.875 --> 01:20.667
Listen to me,
this magazine is gonna be

01:20.750 --> 01:23.291
a lights-out,
call-the-doctor smash.

01:23.375 --> 01:25.500
Cornucopias of cash, my friend.

01:25.583 --> 01:27.125
Corn-u-copias.

01:27.208 --> 01:29.125
Here's another fan letter
from Beanie, Ree.

01:29.208 --> 01:30.792
- Ooh.
- '"Dear Ms. Flynn.'

01:30.875 --> 01:32.500
"Thanks for writing me back.

01:32.583 --> 01:34.625
"I put your pinup
in my locker today.

01:34.709 --> 01:37.291
"You are prettier than
all the stars in the sky."

01:37.375 --> 01:38.500
Oh, he's so sweet.

01:38.583 --> 01:41.250
Yeah, play
with the straw, Ree.

01:41.333 --> 01:42.709
So how was
the picture show last night?

01:42.792 --> 01:44.667
- Didn't go.
- Why, I thought you had a
date.

01:44.750 --> 01:46.667
So did I. The rat
didn't even call.

01:46.750 --> 01:48.083
Oh, you should have come over.

01:48.166 --> 01:49.583
Some of Zip's New York
friends were in town.

01:49.667 --> 01:50.834
You party all night?

01:50.917 --> 01:52.625
Danced with
the sunrise, kookoo.

01:56.250 --> 01:58.333
[laughing]
We're going national.

01:58.417 --> 01:59.500
My new mag's a go.

01:59.583 --> 02:00.917
Rita, they want you
for the cover.

02:01.000 --> 02:03.083
Zip, you're gonna
take the picture.

02:08.917 --> 02:13.667
To Rita...the soda jerk
who changed my life.

02:13.750 --> 02:15.458
To everyone here.

02:15.542 --> 02:17.375
The only family I ever had.

02:17.458 --> 02:19.125
Let's paint
the town red tonight!

03:07.458 --> 03:08.959
Jones?

03:09.041 --> 03:12.083
[sighs]
We got to find another bar.

03:12.166 --> 03:14.583
Got one in mind?

03:14.667 --> 03:16.500
How about...Jones?

03:17.667 --> 03:19.417
Rush, right there.

03:19.500 --> 03:21.000
Uh, Detective Rush?

03:21.083 --> 03:23.083
- Yes?
- Yeah, Gus Medica.

03:23.166 --> 03:25.667
I'm sorry, this is the only
time
I could get here.

03:25.750 --> 03:27.917
Uh, we spoke
on the phone yesterday.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.291
- Mm.
- Rita Flynn?

03:29.375 --> 03:31.583
Oh, right, uh, the pin-up girl.

03:31.667 --> 03:33.458
It's a '53 homicide.

03:33.542 --> 03:36.083
Uh, Detective Valens.
You a relative, Mr. Medica?

03:36.166 --> 03:38.250
No, uh, just a fan.

03:38.333 --> 03:40.709
Rita's pin-up got me
through the Korean War.

03:40.792 --> 03:42.792
My grandson was just
deployed to Afghanistan.

03:42.875 --> 03:45.000
It has me thinking
about Rita again.

03:45.083 --> 03:47.125
Uh, this book
came out a week ago.

03:49.208 --> 03:50.417
Oh, she was a real bombshell.

03:50.500 --> 03:53.625
Oh, she was more
than a great figure.

03:53.709 --> 03:55.750
Her smile gave me hope.

03:55.834 --> 03:57.542
Now, the book says
that this is the first time

03:57.625 --> 03:59.083
that anything
from Rita's crime scene

03:59.166 --> 04:01.917
'has ever been
published.'

04:02.000 --> 04:04.875
Some records clerk moron
probably buddied up

04:04.959 --> 04:07.959
to the media, let them
have access to the box.

04:08.041 --> 04:10.458
Mr. Medica, you said you had
new information on the case?

04:10.542 --> 04:14.750
Uh, yeah. Turns out I've had
it for over 50 years.

04:14.834 --> 04:17.125
I bought this in 1955..

04:17.208 --> 04:19.000
...at an estate sale
of Rita's stuff.

04:19.083 --> 04:20.458
It's not your
usual cheesecake.

04:20.542 --> 04:23.208
No...now, I'm a collector.

04:23.291 --> 04:24.500
This is unique.

04:24.583 --> 04:26.792
I've never, ever seen
another one like it.

04:26.875 --> 04:29.291
(Rush)
'Oh, same clothes.'

04:29.375 --> 04:31.291
'Same position of the
glass on the table.'

04:31.375 --> 04:35.917
That's what I noticed. I
mean,
same outfit same everything.

04:36.000 --> 04:37.375
Well, look at the ice.

04:37.458 --> 04:40.500
'Almost melted in
the crime scene photo.'

04:40.583 --> 04:42.834
Papers back then
had said it was probably..

04:42.917 --> 04:45.000
...some creep broke in.

04:45.083 --> 04:46.792
So, who took this photo?

04:47.917 --> 04:50.291
'That's a photographer's stamp.'

04:50.375 --> 04:53.041
As good as a signature
if we could make it out.

04:53.125 --> 04:55.542
Maybe a new witness.

04:55.625 --> 04:58.333
Or the one
who set Rita's final pose.

05:36.917 --> 05:38.625
A Rita Marie Flynn.

05:38.709 --> 05:39.917
Grew up poor in Tacony.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.583
Mom died young..

05:41.667 --> 05:43.500
...drunk father walked out.

05:44.458 --> 05:45.750
That's a good start in life.

05:45.834 --> 05:47.333
(Rush)
'Discovered by Monty Moran'

05:47.417 --> 05:48.750
at the drugstore
where she worked

05:48.834 --> 05:51.417
with her best friend,
Betty Sue Baker.

05:51.500 --> 05:52.667
Jeffries is trying to find her.

05:52.750 --> 05:56.000
[chuckles]
Betty Sue. Got to love the
'50s.

05:56.083 --> 05:57.875
Downstairs' neighbor
heard a gunshot at 9:00..

05:57.959 --> 06:00.083
ran up, found the chain
on the front door broken

06:00.166 --> 06:01.250
and Rita's body.

06:01.333 --> 06:02.959
Looked like an attempted
sexual assault.

06:03.041 --> 06:04.917
No blood or semen,
but her clothes were torn.

06:05.000 --> 06:07.125
Peeping Tom had been reported
in the neighborhood.

06:07.208 --> 06:08.583
Never caught the guy.

06:08.667 --> 06:10.750
No record
of this mystery photographer.

06:10.834 --> 06:12.709
Wanted to take a picture,
Rita didn't.

06:12.792 --> 06:14.000
She kicks his ass out.

06:14.083 --> 06:15.750
And he comes back
without knocking.

06:15.834 --> 06:18.792
An unregistered Webley .38
was found outside

06:18.875 --> 06:20.333
in the rain near the building.

06:20.417 --> 06:21.875
Matched the body bullet
taken from Rita.

06:21.959 --> 06:23.250
Webley's made in England.

06:23.333 --> 06:25.792
Maybe it was registered there.
Worth a look.

06:25.875 --> 06:29.208
Rita was on the cover
of almost 30 pin-up magazines.

06:29.291 --> 06:32.500
- Those come dog-eared?
- Research.

06:32.583 --> 06:36.041
Early '50s, last days
of selling sex with a G
rating.

06:36.125 --> 06:38.375
You have a pin-up girl, boss?

06:38.458 --> 06:39.625
Sophia Loren.

06:39.709 --> 06:42.291
Had her picture taped
inside my algebra book.

06:42.375 --> 06:44.667
That will get you
through math class.

06:44.750 --> 06:46.208
Check out these theme shoots.

06:46.291 --> 06:47.166
"Circus Girl."

06:47.250 --> 06:49.000
- Classy.
- Ha ha ha.

06:51.709 --> 06:54.375
"Rita dresses
for a night on the town."

06:54.458 --> 06:57.208
"Planting a Garden."

06:57.291 --> 06:59.500
(Vera)
'Gardening...that's just
hot.'

06:59.583 --> 07:03.000
Actually...that is kind of hot.

07:03.083 --> 07:04.917
Arthur Zip Fellig
was Rita's boyfriend.

07:05.000 --> 07:07.333
- Last to see.
- I'll try and track him
down.

07:07.417 --> 07:09.333
Check with the ID unit,
see what else they can get

07:09.417 --> 07:11.417
from Gus's photo of Rita.

07:19.625 --> 07:20.959
You Francine Rafferty?

07:21.041 --> 07:23.000
- Depends.
- On what?

07:23.083 --> 07:24.500
On what you want.

07:24.583 --> 07:27.500
I got a backlog of
surveillance
videos to blow up.

07:27.583 --> 07:28.667
One's from a triple.

07:28.750 --> 07:30.625
I'm Valens. I sent over
the photo of--

07:30.709 --> 07:32.625
The pin-up girl.

07:32.709 --> 07:34.500
Right.

07:34.583 --> 07:36.250
Yeah, that one's interesting.

07:37.750 --> 07:40.709
- Frankie.
- Scotty.

07:40.792 --> 07:43.875
Yeah, it's Kodak paper,
circa early '50s.

07:43.959 --> 07:46.625
Professional print, right
from
the developing bath.

07:46.709 --> 07:48.375
So, this wasn't mass-produced?

07:48.458 --> 07:52.166
No, original.
Straight from a darkroom.

07:52.250 --> 07:54.667
You missed first base,
by the way.

07:54.750 --> 07:57.291
- Sorry?
- Softball game last
Saturday.

08:00.709 --> 08:02.166
You missed it by a foot.

08:02.250 --> 08:05.291
You were too busy
admiring your home run.

08:05.375 --> 08:07.792
- I played second base.
- Oh, yeah.

08:07.875 --> 08:10.375
Yeah, that's right.

08:10.458 --> 08:14.166
What about the, uh...
uh, rubber stamp?

08:14.250 --> 08:16.250
Popped the ink and dirt traces.

08:18.792 --> 08:19.917
Got this.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.417
Stanley Nopell. Oh.

08:22.500 --> 08:25.166
Great work, Frankie. Thanks.

08:26.667 --> 08:29.500
You know, I
touched
that base.

08:29.583 --> 08:32.583
The saddest lies are
the ones we tell ourselves.

08:41.625 --> 08:43.500
"Say cheese" is right.

08:47.750 --> 08:49.083
Welcome to Glamour World.

08:49.166 --> 08:51.667
And...who wants to be a star?

08:51.750 --> 08:55.875
Detectives Valens and Miller.
Philly Homicide.

08:55.959 --> 08:57.959
- We're here about Rita Flynn.
- Rita?

08:58.041 --> 09:00.291
My God, after all these years.

09:00.375 --> 09:02.250
Looks like you
haven't
forgotten.

09:02.333 --> 09:04.875
(Zip)
'Ha ha. She's more
popular than ever.'

09:04.959 --> 09:07.417
'A whole new generation
is falling in love.'

09:07.500 --> 09:09.583
500 bones? Better hope so.

09:09.667 --> 09:11.375
It's an original signature
there.

09:11.458 --> 09:13.333
It's very rare.
Check out my website.

09:13.417 --> 09:15.166
My prints of her
are selling like hotcakes.

09:15.250 --> 09:16.333
We understand
you worked with
her.

09:16.417 --> 09:17.709
(Zip)
'We were a team.'

09:17.792 --> 09:19.625
A good pin-up
isn't just about the model.

09:19.709 --> 09:21.792
We're tracking a
photographer
Rita worked with.

09:21.875 --> 09:24.709
Took this.

09:24.792 --> 09:26.125
Stanley Nopell?

09:26.208 --> 09:27.667
- You know him?
- No.

09:27.750 --> 09:30.250
Wasn't even aware that she
worked with other
photographers.

09:30.333 --> 09:31.750
Seem surprised.

09:31.834 --> 09:33.417
Well, Rita and I
were both under contract..

09:33.500 --> 09:35.667
...to Monty Moran, and..

09:35.750 --> 09:38.291
No, Rita was faithful to me
on both sides of the camera.

09:45.417 --> 09:48.291
Here you go, pops.
I'm yours exclusively.

09:48.375 --> 09:49.875
You won't regret it.

09:49.959 --> 09:52.333
We're like the immortal team
of Buonarroti and Cavalieri.

09:52.417 --> 09:53.834
- Who are they?
- No idea.

09:53.917 --> 09:55.041
I heard that
line
in a movie.

09:58.500 --> 10:00.667
Look, Rita. He asked me out.

10:00.750 --> 10:03.125
'He's got blue eyes to die for.'

10:03.208 --> 10:06.458
- Isn't he a dish?
- Oh, supper and dessert.

10:06.542 --> 10:08.917
- Who is he?
- He's a banker.

10:09.000 --> 10:11.834
- 'He's really sweet.'
- Oh, Betty.

10:11.917 --> 10:13.959
[giggles]
This one feels lucky.

10:14.041 --> 10:16.000
Uh, hi. Um, are you Rita Flynn?

10:16.083 --> 10:18.125
- Uh-huh.
- No, she's the Pope.

10:18.208 --> 10:21.125
- Can I have your autograph?
- Sure thing, doll.

10:23.750 --> 10:24.875
Oh, golly.

10:25.917 --> 10:28.250
- Ha ha ha.
- Drool is so charming.

10:28.333 --> 10:30.291
I used to jerk soda
for that fella.

10:30.375 --> 10:32.041
Bet he didn't ask
for your autograph then.

10:32.125 --> 10:34.542
Life's funny, ain't it, kookoo?

10:36.333 --> 10:38.291
Oh-ho-ho. Ahh.

10:38.375 --> 10:39.625
Hey, Rita, it's your song.

10:39.709 --> 10:41.166
- Do your thing.
- Aren't you tired of it?

10:41.250 --> 10:44.041
- Come on, Ree. Do it.
- Okay.

11:15.000 --> 11:17.583
[sighs]
Funny old geezer.

11:17.667 --> 11:19.208
He's got a face like an angel.

11:22.041 --> 11:23.583
You and me to the top
of the top.

11:23.667 --> 11:24.750
To the top of the top!

11:31.000 --> 11:33.375
Rita was the life of the..

11:35.417 --> 11:38.250
She was my life.
We were going to get married.

11:38.333 --> 11:40.625
All that male attention
make any boyfriend
jealous.

11:40.709 --> 11:42.417
Ah, it's just part
of the business.

11:42.500 --> 11:43.750
Long as she went home with me.

11:43.834 --> 11:45.750
Back in the day,
you said you were home

11:45.834 --> 11:47.709
the night Rita was killed.

11:47.792 --> 11:50.792
Hit the sack early that night
for a big shoot in the
morning.

11:50.875 --> 11:52.000
What about Monty?

11:52.083 --> 11:53.000
He could've hired this..

11:53.083 --> 11:54.583
...Nopell guy for another shoot.

11:54.667 --> 11:56.750
If he was a photographer,
Monty would have known him.

11:56.834 --> 11:58.625
- He knew everyone.
- But you never heard of him?

11:58.709 --> 12:01.250
No. I told you I. I-I didn't.

12:01.333 --> 12:02.458
(Miller)
'Stay in town, Zip.'

12:02.542 --> 12:05.250
I might be back for a headshot.

12:11.917 --> 12:13.709
Hmm. Rita.

12:14.709 --> 12:16.458
Yeah, she was a sweet kid.

12:16.542 --> 12:18.291
She was like a daughter to me.

12:18.375 --> 12:20.709
Yeah, to this day
I blame myself.

12:20.792 --> 12:23.959
- Why is that, Monty?
- Well, I made her famous.

12:24.041 --> 12:25.291
And with fame came..

12:25.375 --> 12:27.625
...the attention
of men, good and bad.

12:27.709 --> 12:29.291
In those days,
any creep could find

12:29.375 --> 12:30.625
her address in the phone book.

12:30.709 --> 12:32.458
You own a gun
back in '53, Monty?

12:32.542 --> 12:33.625
No. Why?

12:33.709 --> 12:34.709
Well, police never
took
a statement

12:34.792 --> 12:35.792
from you back then.

12:35.875 --> 12:36.875
Well, I thought she was
assaulted

12:36.959 --> 12:38.792
by some sick pervert.

12:38.875 --> 12:41.458
Did Rita have her picture
taken by anyone besides
Zip?

12:41.542 --> 12:44.709
Oh, guys always wanted
to take her picture.

12:44.792 --> 12:47.417
See, the thing
about a good photo..

12:47.500 --> 12:50.333
...is you can stare
at it over and over..

12:50.417 --> 12:52.333
...and still find..

12:52.417 --> 12:53.875
...a new meaning in it.

12:53.959 --> 12:57.166
We're looking for a
photographer
named Stanley Nopell.

12:57.250 --> 12:58.500
Took this picture of Rita.

12:58.583 --> 13:01.291
You ever work with him, Monty?

13:01.375 --> 13:05.709
Stanley Nopell?
Never heard of him.

13:05.792 --> 13:07.667
Did Rita mention
anyone in particular

13:07.750 --> 13:08.834
might have been bothering her?

13:08.917 --> 13:11.333
No, she never said anything.

13:11.417 --> 13:12.875
But, well, there..

13:13.000 --> 13:16.041
...there was a fan.
Took things a little too
far.

13:17.917 --> 13:21.208
Al, what part of "Opportunity
of Brobdingnagian proportions"

13:21.291 --> 13:22.917
do you not understand?

13:23.000 --> 13:24.750
Hey, what's the holdup?

13:24.834 --> 13:26.792
Zip's running late.
Keep your hat on,
kookoo.

13:26.875 --> 13:28.875
So what are you gonna wear
for
the big date with Blue Eyes?

13:28.959 --> 13:31.542
I don't know. I wish
I could buy something new.

13:31.625 --> 13:32.792
Borrow something from wardrobe.

13:32.875 --> 13:34.208
- No one'll notice.
- You think?

13:34.291 --> 13:36.041
Sure, but I want you
to report back to me

13:36.125 --> 13:37.875
lickety-split
after the date.

13:37.959 --> 13:39.333
I want to hear everything.

13:49.583 --> 13:51.083
Smile, you're on candid camera.

14:05.834 --> 14:07.917
(Monty)
'Oh, Mr. DeMille, I presume.'

14:08.000 --> 14:10.083
- Sorry, boss. Traffic.
- Alright.

14:10.166 --> 14:11.417
Hup two.
Folks, break's over.

14:11.500 --> 14:13.834
Oh, I forgot my lei!

14:17.500 --> 14:18.875
Hey! Hey!

14:19.875 --> 14:22.083
Beanie Emerson...yeah.

14:22.166 --> 14:24.417
'He was the president
of Rita's fan club.'

14:24.500 --> 14:26.041
Sounds like he took to the job.

14:26.125 --> 14:28.750
The kid showed up
everywhere we went.

14:28.834 --> 14:32.417
- She consider him a friend?
- No, he was just a boy.

14:32.500 --> 14:35.375
Back then, we thought
it was teenage hijinks.

14:35.458 --> 14:37.125
Hmm. Right.

14:37.208 --> 14:39.542
Now we just call it "stalking."

14:43.458 --> 14:46.625
Up all night trying to track
this...Stanley Nopell dude.

14:46.709 --> 14:48.625
- Any luck?
- The guy's a ghost.

14:48.709 --> 14:50.959
No driver's license,
voter registration..

14:51.041 --> 14:52.458
...like he don't exist.

14:52.542 --> 14:54.125
Well, we found Beanie.

14:54.208 --> 14:57.583
- Got him in the box.
- He still go by Beanie?

15:03.125 --> 15:04.375
Research.

15:12.792 --> 15:13.834
How're you doing, Ben?

15:13.917 --> 15:15.875
Detectives Miller and Valens.

15:17.041 --> 15:19.792
- This really about Rita
Flynn?
- Really is.

15:19.875 --> 15:21.291
Understand you were
president of her fan club.

15:21.375 --> 15:24.250
Huh, you bet. This was
back in the '50s.

15:24.333 --> 15:25.709
So it was you?

15:25.792 --> 15:27.333
Snuck into Rita's apartment
night she died?

15:27.417 --> 15:29.792
What? No.

15:29.875 --> 15:31.166
You broke
into her dressing room.

15:31.250 --> 15:32.542
Figure apartment's
a piece of cake.

15:32.625 --> 15:34.834
Still got the panty
collection, Beanie?

15:34.917 --> 15:38.750
I was out of town
with my parents when Rita
died.

15:38.834 --> 15:42.709
- 'Florida.'
- That wasn't the question,
Ben.

15:42.792 --> 15:45.208
[sighs]
Look, I was-I was 15.

15:45.291 --> 15:47.333
You know what those pictures
do to a kid that age?

15:47.417 --> 15:50.083
Got an eyewitness saw you
breaking and entering, Beanie.

15:50.166 --> 15:51.458
You were stalking her.

15:51.542 --> 15:54.667
Maybe I was a little bit
too, you know, zealous.

15:56.041 --> 15:58.709
I admit, I did follow
her around a lot.

15:58.792 --> 16:00.542
But it wasn't me
she had to fear.

16:47.333 --> 16:50.333
Betty?

16:50.417 --> 16:51.792
Betty, wait.

16:51.875 --> 16:54.667
- Wait! Wait.
- What are you doing here?

16:54.750 --> 16:56.500
I came to show
you something.

16:56.583 --> 16:59.000
Your dad said
this was a restaurant.

17:00.125 --> 17:02.917
I told my dad
I'm waiting tables.

17:03.000 --> 17:04.291
Please, Rita, just go.

17:04.375 --> 17:06.166
Do you need money?
I could lend you some.

17:06.250 --> 17:09.250
You got $500 for
all of last years' rent?

17:09.333 --> 17:10.250
Doesn't your dad pay for--

17:10.333 --> 17:12.625
My dad drinks away every penny

17:12.709 --> 17:14.750
I make from photo shoots.

17:14.834 --> 17:16.792
Oh.

17:16.875 --> 17:18.834
You were wrong, Rita.

17:18.917 --> 17:21.458
Men do like to see.

17:21.542 --> 17:25.000
- And they pay for it.
- But, Betty, this isn't
you.

17:25.083 --> 17:26.917
And what if blue eyes finds out?

17:27.000 --> 17:29.166
How would he find out?

17:29.250 --> 17:31.375
- Oh, no, Betty, I'd--
- Go to hell!

17:35.959 --> 17:38.125
Yeah, I thought
they were friends.

17:38.208 --> 17:39.959
But that girl..

17:40.041 --> 17:43.834
...she was angry.

17:43.917 --> 17:46.542
- Ashamed or something.
- Shame.

17:46.625 --> 17:49.041
Guess that's something
a panty sniffer like you

17:49.125 --> 17:50.041
don't suffer much, huh?

17:50.125 --> 17:51.291
What's that supposed to mean?

17:51.375 --> 17:52.959
(Miller)
'Such a big fan of Rita..'

17:53.041 --> 17:54.625
...why didn't you tell
somebody about this?

17:54.709 --> 17:58.792
I was a minor. I wasn't even
supposed to be in that club.

17:58.875 --> 18:00.875
Thanks for your time..

18:00.959 --> 18:02.250
...Beanie.

18:06.417 --> 18:07.917
Thank you.

18:10.750 --> 18:13.834
Hello. Are you here about
the Bangladesh recovery?

18:13.917 --> 18:15.834
I'm Detective Rush, Betty.

18:15.917 --> 18:17.333
- Philly Homicide.
- "Homicide"?

18:17.417 --> 18:20.500
- I don't understand.
- It's about Rita Flynn.

18:20.583 --> 18:23.083
Rita? For heaven's sake.

18:23.166 --> 18:24.667
You told the police back then

18:24.750 --> 18:26.208
the two of you
were good friends.

18:26.291 --> 18:28.041
Best of friends.

18:28.125 --> 18:30.375
You two ever get into a spat?

18:31.542 --> 18:33.542
No.

18:33.625 --> 18:36.375
She made a lot more money
than you as a model.

18:36.458 --> 18:39.542
How about you? Do you get paid
enough to make ends meet?

18:39.625 --> 18:41.291
I suppose.

18:41.375 --> 18:44.458
You remember a club called
"The Red Curtain?"

18:48.667 --> 18:51.667
Ms. Rush, that was
a long time ago.

18:51.750 --> 18:55.834
My father was an alcoholic
who needed my help.

18:55.917 --> 18:58.583
I'm not proud, but...
I did what I had to do.

18:58.667 --> 19:01.208
Well, desperate people
do desperate things.

19:01.291 --> 19:02.959
If you're implying
I had anything to do

19:03.041 --> 19:04.041
with Rita's death..

19:04.125 --> 19:06.417
You lied about the fight, Betty.

19:07.166 --> 19:09.000
I was upset.

19:10.166 --> 19:12.542
Rita calmed me down.
We had a heart-to-heart.

19:12.625 --> 19:15.208
- When was this?
- At the club.

19:15.291 --> 19:19.000
Only Rita could find humanity
in such a depressing place.

19:29.959 --> 19:32.000
I'm so sorry.

19:32.083 --> 19:34.208
I just lost my temper.
I'm under such
pressure.

19:34.291 --> 19:35.709
You don't have
to apologize, Betty.

19:35.792 --> 19:37.417
- 'I just want to help
you.'
- I know.

19:37.500 --> 19:40.291
So what was that surprise
that you came to show me?

19:40.375 --> 19:43.625
Oh! Remember when I was
taking pictures?

19:43.709 --> 19:46.917
Ta-da! There's
a great one of you.

19:53.125 --> 19:55.583
But these aren't
glamorous.

19:55.667 --> 19:57.041
Ordinary life
can be beautiful too.

19:57.125 --> 19:59.709
"Ordinary life?"
What are you talking about?

19:59.792 --> 20:01.917
I don't know. Real stuff.

20:02.000 --> 20:03.333
Remember when we
were jerking soda

20:03.417 --> 20:05.083
all the crazy characters
who would come in?

20:05.166 --> 20:07.041
You mean like
Half-a-scoop Lou?

20:07.125 --> 20:10.750
[chuckles]
Yeah! "A full scoop's
bad for the joints."

20:10.834 --> 20:14.458
See, I miss people like that.

20:16.792 --> 20:17.792
See him?

20:17.875 --> 20:20.667
That's a face
with a thousand stories.

20:25.875 --> 20:28.709
Get that camera out of here!

20:28.792 --> 20:30.667
Lady, you better
destroy that picture

20:30.750 --> 20:33.250
or so help me,
I'll do it for you myself!

20:33.333 --> 20:35.166
'Get off me!'

20:38.250 --> 20:40.375
You know that guy?

20:40.458 --> 20:41.959
Regular.

20:42.041 --> 20:44.625
Named Reg Donaldson.

20:44.709 --> 20:47.792
Came back from the front
with a few screws loose.

20:47.875 --> 20:49.083
World War II vet?

20:49.166 --> 20:51.291
Everyone walked around him
on eggshells.

20:51.375 --> 20:53.500
The scariest guy
in a scary place.

20:53.583 --> 20:55.625
You know if he carried a gun?

20:55.709 --> 20:57.583
I saw him pull it
one night on a drunk

20:57.667 --> 21:00.000
'who took his
seat
by mistake.'

21:00.083 --> 21:02.709
So you saw this man
pull a gun on someone..

21:02.792 --> 21:05.625
...Rita's shot to death, and
you
never went to the police?

21:05.709 --> 21:07.500
Detective...I saw this

21:07.583 --> 21:10.250
when I was
working as a dancer.

21:13.417 --> 21:16.583
Good to see you turned
your life around, Betty.

21:16.667 --> 21:18.166
Think of anything else..

21:18.250 --> 21:19.542
...give me a call.

21:23.458 --> 21:24.959
Hey.

21:25.041 --> 21:27.834
- Found something?
- Maybe.

21:27.917 --> 21:29.166
Here.

21:29.250 --> 21:30.834
At first, I thought
this was a lighter.

21:30.917 --> 21:33.000
- You see that?
- Yeah, what is it?

21:33.083 --> 21:34.166
Here, look closer.

21:35.792 --> 21:38.375
Camera that took
this
was a Leica IIIa.

21:38.458 --> 21:42.667
It's unique for the time. That's
actually the self-timer switch.

21:42.750 --> 21:46.500
- Are you listening?
- The Leica IIIa,
self-timer.

21:46.583 --> 21:47.917
Mm-hmm.

21:48.000 --> 21:51.125
Saying Rita
took that photo herself.

21:51.208 --> 21:52.583
Exactly.

21:54.875 --> 21:56.959
Turns out that
American
shell-shocked war vet

21:57.041 --> 22:00.667
from the strip club spent
time
in a psych ward in
England.

22:00.750 --> 22:03.083
Along with our gun.
Check this out.

22:03.166 --> 22:05.375
ID unit says the photo
Gus brought in

22:05.458 --> 22:07.542
was a self-portrait.

22:07.625 --> 22:09.917
But the stamp says Stanley.

22:11.583 --> 22:14.291
[chuckles]
It's that song she used to
sing.

22:16.208 --> 22:19.083
"Istanbul was Constantinople.

22:19.166 --> 22:20.875
"Now it's Istanbul.

22:22.792 --> 22:25.458
"Not Constantinople.

22:25.542 --> 22:27.375
"Istanbul was Constantinople.

22:27.458 --> 22:29.583
Now it's...Istanbul."

22:32.083 --> 22:33.208
Rita..

22:34.750 --> 22:36.750
...was Stanley Nopell.

22:36.834 --> 22:38.792
Saying she was
a photographer?

22:38.875 --> 22:40.291
Trying to be, at least.

22:40.375 --> 22:42.250
Not a lot of female
photographers back then

22:42.333 --> 22:44.083
so she makes up a man's name.

22:44.166 --> 22:46.542
Snaps a shot of Reg Donaldson
with a stripper.

22:46.625 --> 22:48.542
Yeah, married guy,
caught red-handed.

22:48.625 --> 22:50.166
Guy's half off
his nut already.

22:50.250 --> 22:51.917
Not a photo you want
coming home to the missus.

22:52.000 --> 22:54.834
So this guy wasn't going
after Rita the pin-up girl.

22:54.917 --> 22:57.750
He was after Rita
the photographer.

23:06.959 --> 23:09.458
Ever spend time
in the UK, Mr. Donaldson?

23:09.542 --> 23:11.125
I thought this was
about Rita Flynn.

23:11.208 --> 23:13.291
Oh, if you could
answer the
question.

23:13.375 --> 23:14.875
I was in England after the war.

23:14.959 --> 23:16.375
Pick up a gun
while you were
there?

23:16.458 --> 23:19.125
- No.
- But you owned a firearm?

23:19.208 --> 23:21.625
A Browning .22. I worked
nights
in a bad neighborhood.

23:21.709 --> 23:23.125
Understand you spent
some time under

23:23.208 --> 23:24.500
a doctor's psychiatric care.

23:24.583 --> 23:26.041
[sighs]
What is this?

23:26.125 --> 23:28.291
We've got witnesses saying
you threatened Rita Flynn.

23:28.375 --> 23:30.709
What? You think I shot her?

23:30.792 --> 23:33.166
She had a photo that could have
broken up your marriage.

23:33.250 --> 23:36.250
My marriage was already broken.

23:36.333 --> 23:40.667
I overreacted. I-I just
wanted to be anonymous.

23:41.583 --> 23:42.709
Anonymous?

23:42.792 --> 23:44.041
I was pretty messed up
after the war.

23:44.125 --> 23:47.417
Couldn't relate
to people, just a..

23:47.500 --> 23:50.041
...bottle in a bar.

23:50.125 --> 23:51.500
Did you see
Rita
again, Reg?

23:51.583 --> 23:55.375
Yeah, she found me
and apologized.

23:55.458 --> 23:57.750
Asked me to help her out..

23:57.834 --> 23:59.250
...take her around
the old neighborhood.

23:59.333 --> 24:00.834
- Where's that?
- Tacony.

24:00.917 --> 24:04.375
She wanted
to take pictures.

24:04.458 --> 24:06.917
She pulled me out of the dark.

25:11.041 --> 25:14.083
She said she was going
to show me the pictures

25:14.166 --> 25:16.667
but then I read
in the paper
that..

25:18.667 --> 25:21.250
What a world.

25:21.333 --> 25:22.709
Where were you that night, Reg?

25:22.792 --> 25:24.917
Same place I was
every night, The Red
Curtain

25:25.000 --> 25:26.166
trying to forget.

25:26.250 --> 25:27.250
Rita mention anyone

25:27.333 --> 25:28.417
she was having problems with?

25:28.500 --> 25:30.083
No, she was in a good mood.

25:30.166 --> 25:31.667
She...said she was thinking

25:31.750 --> 25:33.291
about quitting modeling.

25:35.083 --> 25:36.458
(Valens)
'Quick follow-up.'

25:36.542 --> 25:38.750
Think Rita got that photo
developed somewhere

25:38.834 --> 25:41.417
or could she have
done it on her own?

25:43.041 --> 25:44.792
Lots of photography clubs
back then.

25:44.875 --> 25:46.458
'Home darkrooms
were pretty common.'

25:46.542 --> 25:47.792
Right.

25:50.375 --> 25:52.041
So...who are these people?

25:52.125 --> 25:55.250
Your great-grandfather
in there or something?

25:55.333 --> 25:58.041
No, I-I found it
inside a used book.

25:58.125 --> 26:01.250
Every time I'd look at it, I
see
something new. You know?

26:01.333 --> 26:03.500
'Like that guy's
derby hat there..'

26:03.583 --> 26:04.709
'...that woman's smile.'

26:04.792 --> 26:06.291
- I wonder what made her
smile.
- 'Yeah.'

26:06.375 --> 26:08.542
I love the mystery
of old photographs.

26:08.625 --> 26:11.792
- 'We'll never know.'
- Well, maybe we do.

26:11.875 --> 26:14.083
You see that guy?
He's knocking boots with her.

26:14.166 --> 26:16.542
'Just whispered in her ear,
"my compartment..'

26:16.625 --> 26:17.625
...five minutes."

26:17.709 --> 26:19.208
No.

26:19.291 --> 26:24.125
She just slipped a
slow-acting
poison in that guy's drink.

26:24.208 --> 26:26.250
- Why?
- 'Well, it's her husband.'

26:26.333 --> 26:30.208
She's gonna inherit
a million bucks.

26:30.291 --> 26:34.417
Huh. Wicked
imagination,
Frankie.

26:34.500 --> 26:36.166
Is your cellphone dead?

26:36.250 --> 26:38.500
My phone? No.

26:38.583 --> 26:42.000
Quick follow-ups
are phone calls.

26:42.083 --> 26:44.083
Unless there's another
reason you stopped by.

26:44.166 --> 26:46.792
Yeah. I got reservations.

26:46.875 --> 26:48.542
- You and me.
- Dinner?

26:48.625 --> 26:50.709
- No.
- What did you have in mind?

26:50.792 --> 26:53.000
- That a yes?
- Yes.

27:05.625 --> 27:07.041
Hey, Miller got a hit
on the gun.

27:07.125 --> 27:09.750
Registered
to a Philip Moran in London.

27:09.834 --> 27:13.166
- Moran? Related to Monty Moran?
- His uncle.

27:13.250 --> 27:16.291
Couldn't be our doer
because he died in January '53

27:16.375 --> 27:17.959
five months
before Rita was murdered.

27:18.041 --> 27:19.458
Uncle could have
given it to Monty.

27:19.542 --> 27:21.333
And Monty started
a British version

27:21.417 --> 27:22.875
of See Magazine in 1950.

27:22.959 --> 27:25.750
Traveled back and forth
all the time.

27:25.834 --> 27:28.083
(Stillman)
'Got a little
gun problem, Monty.'

27:28.166 --> 27:30.250
Haven't we already
gone over this?

27:30.333 --> 27:32.709
Yeah, which means
either you're lying
or..

27:32.792 --> 27:34.500
...you're
starting
to slip.

27:34.583 --> 27:38.375
Wasn't your magazine
that got Rita killed.

27:38.458 --> 27:39.875
It was your gun.

27:39.959 --> 27:42.709
[chuckling]
Hey, I-I never fired
a gun in my life.

27:42.792 --> 27:45.000
Except the one that killed Rita.

27:45.083 --> 27:47.667
This was registered
to your dead uncle.

27:54.041 --> 27:57.291
My God, I'd forgotten
all about the damn thing.

27:57.375 --> 27:59.041
My uncle gave it
to me for a gift.

27:59.125 --> 28:02.375
Webley .38. Bullet from
that gun ended up in Rita.

28:02.458 --> 28:05.041
That gun was stolen two
months
before Rita died.

28:05.125 --> 28:08.625
- You never reported it.
- Look, this is ludicrous.

28:08.709 --> 28:10.417
I had no reason to kill Rita.

28:10.500 --> 28:11.875
She tell you she was
gonna quit modeling?

28:11.959 --> 28:14.250
Eh, she told me about it,
but I wasn't upset.

28:14.333 --> 28:15.959
(Stillman)
'You invested a lot
of money in her.'

28:16.041 --> 28:18.083
Would have taken a big hit
of your circulation.

28:18.166 --> 28:19.625
Yeah, but I was not about to let

28:19.709 --> 28:22.291
an asset like that
walk out the door.

28:27.875 --> 28:30.041
- Are you decent?
- I used to be.

28:30.125 --> 28:31.458
You should lock
your door, cupcake.

28:45.000 --> 28:47.083
What have we got here?

28:48.667 --> 28:50.625
These are fantastic.

28:50.709 --> 28:52.000
Who took 'em?

28:52.083 --> 28:53.125
Me.

28:54.250 --> 28:55.709
Come on. Don't kid a kidder.

28:55.792 --> 28:57.291
No kidding, kookoo.

29:00.291 --> 29:03.917
You got more tricks up your
sleeve than Harry Houdini.

29:04.000 --> 29:05.125
I'm through with pin-ups, Monty.

29:05.208 --> 29:06.458
Thought you were having fun.

29:06.542 --> 29:09.375
I'm bored of making
other people smile.

29:09.458 --> 29:12.291
When I take
these pictures...I smile.

29:12.375 --> 29:13.834
So you want to be a
photographer?

29:13.917 --> 29:16.875
I don't know. Maybe.

29:16.959 --> 29:18.458
These are like the ones
they got in Life Magazine.

29:18.542 --> 29:20.750
'You could be a
photojournalist,
take serious pictures.'

29:20.834 --> 29:24.375
- You think?
- Oh, no, n-no, Rita.

29:24.458 --> 29:26.166
'I-I didn't sign you
to a pin-up contract'

29:26.250 --> 29:28.750
'cause I wanted
your autograph, so..

29:31.583 --> 29:33.166
But can't we work something out.

29:41.083 --> 29:42.083
Tell you what.

29:42.166 --> 29:45.250
How'd you like 'em published?

29:45.333 --> 29:47.959
Oh, come on. Hey,
don't kid a kidder.

29:48.041 --> 29:51.583
You got a real way
of understanding people.

29:51.667 --> 29:54.208
I can see it
in those pictures too.

29:56.500 --> 29:57.834
Now you're just trying
to sweet-talk me.

29:57.917 --> 30:00.917
Hey, if I can't have you
as a pin-up girl..

30:01.000 --> 30:02.750
...I sure as hell want you
as a photographer.

30:06.917 --> 30:10.166
As talented as Rita was
in front of the camera..

30:10.250 --> 30:12.083
...she was even more
talented behind it.

30:12.166 --> 30:14.959
Hell, I was even going
to make more money that way.

30:15.041 --> 30:18.208
What a sell,
"Queen of the lens."

30:20.792 --> 30:22.709
Still got some
of her old negatives too.

30:22.792 --> 30:24.917
I never could bring myself
to print them.

30:25.000 --> 30:26.625
Who else had access
to that gun, Monty?

30:26.709 --> 30:30.583
Uh, I kept it locked up
in a small safe in the
studio.

30:30.667 --> 30:32.375
Anyone else have a key
to that safe?

30:32.458 --> 30:34.166
Mm. No, just Zip.

30:34.250 --> 30:36.083
'Kept his expensive lenses
in there.'

30:36.166 --> 30:38.083
Did Zip know Rita wanted
to leave modeling?

30:38.166 --> 30:39.917
[chuckling]
I don't know,
but I'll tell you one thing

30:40.000 --> 30:42.458
I was-I wasn't sad
to see him go.

30:42.542 --> 30:45.834
Package deal like that,
I was better off without.

30:45.917 --> 30:47.583
Talking about Zip with Rita?

30:47.667 --> 30:49.083
All that time, I thought that..

30:49.166 --> 30:51.959
...that blowhard
made her look good.

30:52.041 --> 30:55.208
Till I realized
it was the other way around.

31:00.000 --> 31:02.083
(Zip)
'Yes, ma'am, uh,
the pictures are ready.'

31:02.166 --> 31:05.917
'Are you aware of our
two-for-one special on 8x10s?'

31:06.000 --> 31:07.417
Special can wait, Zippy.

31:07.500 --> 31:10.083
You remember the safe
Monty had in his studio?

31:10.166 --> 31:12.083
Safe? No.

31:12.166 --> 31:13.750
You should.
He gave you a key to it.

31:13.834 --> 31:15.083
That's where you kept
your lenses, right?

31:15.166 --> 31:17.083
I guess. Oh, yeah,
come to think of it

31:17.166 --> 31:19.125
uh, I stored a
few
of 'em in there.

31:19.208 --> 31:20.959
Along with his gun.
Come to think of that?

31:21.041 --> 31:22.542
No, I don't
remember any gun.

31:22.625 --> 31:24.792
Well, how about Rita telling
you
she wanted to quit modeling?

31:24.875 --> 31:26.291
Well, that was just
something she said.

31:26.375 --> 31:27.750
Said she wanted
to become a photographer.

31:27.834 --> 31:29.583
[scoffs]
Please.

31:29.667 --> 31:31.625
Taking a few snapshots
and doing what I do

31:31.709 --> 31:32.959
are two different
things entirely.

31:33.041 --> 31:34.583
I checked your résumé, Zip.

31:34.667 --> 31:36.333
You had a hard time
getting work after Rita died.

31:36.417 --> 31:37.792
I loved Ree.

31:37.875 --> 31:40.291
It took me a while before I
could photograph a woman again.

31:40.375 --> 31:43.041
Yeah, especially since no
other
magazine would hire you.

31:43.125 --> 31:45.458
'Barely lasted another year
as a pin-up photographer.'

31:45.542 --> 31:46.792
That's 'cause you were a hack.

31:46.875 --> 31:48.375
You don't know
what you're talking about.

31:48.458 --> 31:50.875
- I created Rita.
- She outgrew you, Zip.

31:50.959 --> 31:54.250
No, it was a relationship.
She-she needed me.

31:54.333 --> 31:56.750
She needed you to let her go,
but you just couldn't do that.

31:56.834 --> 31:59.709
No. I was the photographer.

32:03.500 --> 32:04.709
I mean, we had
a good thing going..

32:04.792 --> 32:06.667
...the two of us.

32:06.750 --> 32:11.583
[sighs]
Till she had to go and turn
everything upside down.

32:18.750 --> 32:20.667
These are interesting.

32:20.750 --> 32:22.083
Who'd you say did this?

32:22.166 --> 32:24.792
Me. What do you think?

32:29.667 --> 32:32.417
You wanna quit
modeling for this?

32:32.500 --> 32:35.041
They're ugly.

32:37.375 --> 32:40.500
Well, I'm...
I'm just getting started.

32:40.583 --> 32:43.583
- I'll get better.
- Stick to smiling pretty,
baby.

32:43.667 --> 32:46.291
Don't ruin a good thing.

32:46.375 --> 32:48.750
Don't you believe in me, Zip?

32:48.834 --> 32:51.792
And what about "You and me all
the way to the top of the top?"

32:51.875 --> 32:53.542
Or we can both do it
as photographers.

32:53.625 --> 32:55.667
Look, I'm the photographer.

32:55.750 --> 32:59.542
You're a pin-up girl.
That's the way it is.

32:59.625 --> 33:02.250
I want to take
different kinds of pictures.

33:02.333 --> 33:05.500
- Like a journalist.
- Journalism takes brains.

33:05.583 --> 33:07.250
Dedication.

33:07.333 --> 33:09.834
No more sing-alongs
in bars behaving like a tramp.

33:14.208 --> 33:17.458
My mother taught me
to sing along like
that.

33:17.542 --> 33:18.917
I told you that.

33:19.000 --> 33:20.875
She used to dance around the
kitchen when I was a little
girl

33:20.959 --> 33:24.375
singing goofy songs to me.

33:24.458 --> 33:27.250
I was gonna teach our
daughter
the same thing one day.

33:32.959 --> 33:35.166
I don't think we want
the same things anymore

33:35.250 --> 33:36.417
do we, Zip?

33:36.500 --> 33:38.583
I think you should go.

33:53.375 --> 33:56.625
I knew as soon
as I saw those photos.

33:56.709 --> 33:58.542
She was good.

33:58.625 --> 34:00.583
I just couldn't admit
to it at the time.

34:00.667 --> 34:04.000
You couldn't handle that she
was more talented than you.

34:04.083 --> 34:06.875
Instead, I was cruel.

34:06.959 --> 34:08.709
And that was
the last time I saw her.

34:08.792 --> 34:10.500
I went to
Monty's studio that night

34:10.583 --> 34:12.000
'to get my prints of Rita.'

34:12.083 --> 34:14.750
I knew they'd be
valuable someday.

34:14.834 --> 34:16.250
Took me all night
to pack 'em up.

34:16.333 --> 34:17.500
Anyone to back that up?

34:17.583 --> 34:18.875
Betty Sue was there.

34:18.959 --> 34:22.750
Trying on some of Rita's
wardrobe for her date.

34:22.834 --> 34:24.834
Betty Sue borrowed
Rita's clothes?

34:24.917 --> 34:26.583
Well, the kid
didn't have any money.

34:26.667 --> 34:28.458
Do you remember
if she took a purse?

34:28.542 --> 34:29.834
- 'A purse?'
- For her date.

34:29.917 --> 34:32.959
- Did she borrow a purse?
- I don't know.

34:33.041 --> 34:34.250
She was awful excited, though.

34:34.333 --> 34:36.000
She, uh, made me
take a picture of her.

34:36.083 --> 34:38.625
- You still have that
picture?
- I'm a photographer.

34:38.709 --> 34:40.625
Got a negative
of every picture I ever
took.

34:40.709 --> 34:42.917
Dig it up and print it.

34:45.375 --> 34:47.917
Betty Sue dresses
for a night on the town.

34:56.166 --> 35:00.083
You remember when
that photo was taken?

35:00.166 --> 35:02.041
I don't know.

35:02.125 --> 35:04.000
It's at the studio.

35:04.083 --> 35:05.500
Must have been a photo shoot.

35:05.583 --> 35:07.417
Oh, Zip said he took it
the night Rita was killed.

35:07.500 --> 35:08.375
He did?

35:08.458 --> 35:09.709
You were at the studio

35:09.792 --> 35:11.500
getting ready
for your big date.

35:11.583 --> 35:14.709
Oh, well, I'll
be.
I'd forgotten.

35:14.792 --> 35:18.041
You forgot a lot, Betty.

35:18.125 --> 35:20.667
I been going
over these pin-up magazines.

35:20.750 --> 35:22.166
Seems like a time capsule.

35:22.250 --> 35:24.500
You chose Rita's
"Night on the town" outfit

35:24.583 --> 35:26.166
for your date with Blue Eyes.

35:26.250 --> 35:30.875
Hmm. Quite a trip
down memory lane.

35:30.959 --> 35:33.875
But what does that have
to do with Rita's murder?

35:33.959 --> 35:35.542
Everything.

35:39.458 --> 35:41.667
'You see that purse?'

35:41.750 --> 35:43.750
'You had it with you
on your date.'

35:43.834 --> 35:45.667
So how does it end up
in Rita's apartment?

35:45.750 --> 35:48.125
I just figured Rita
borrowed it from wardrobe.

35:48.208 --> 35:50.834
- Maybe she did.
- No.

35:50.917 --> 35:52.709
'No.'

35:52.792 --> 35:56.792
The only way that purse
gets to this crime scene

35:56.875 --> 35:58.917
is if you brought it.

36:01.041 --> 36:02.625
I did stop by.

36:02.709 --> 36:06.041
But I didn't hurt Rita.

36:06.125 --> 36:08.208
[sighs]
I ran your fingerprints,
Betty.

36:08.291 --> 36:10.000
'Matches the gun.'

36:10.083 --> 36:11.417
How did you get
my fingerprints?

36:11.500 --> 36:13.250
A report from the crime lab.

36:13.333 --> 36:16.583
And your prints are all over
your office at St. Mary's.

36:18.333 --> 36:20.083
Patriot Act.
Special subpoena.

36:20.166 --> 36:22.500
We dusted that place
two nights ago.

36:24.834 --> 36:27.458
- I didn't have a gun.
- You were Monty's assistant.

36:27.542 --> 36:28.959
You had copies of all his keys.

36:29.041 --> 36:30.792
The strip club was
a dangerous place.

36:30.875 --> 36:32.250
You took Monty's gun
for protection.

36:32.333 --> 36:35.166
- Oh, that gun.
- Yes, I had it.

36:36.458 --> 36:38.208
I don't know how
it got to Rita's apartment.

36:38.291 --> 36:39.959
(Rush)
'Well, your date ended
early..'

36:40.041 --> 36:42.542
...so you went to Rita's
to talk about it.

36:42.625 --> 36:44.083
Just like she made you promise.

36:44.166 --> 36:46.917
Your date was at 8:00.
The gunshot was heard at 9:00.

36:47.000 --> 36:49.083
Your date didn't go
well, did it?

36:49.166 --> 36:50.875
A couple drinks
to numb the pain.

36:51.000 --> 36:55.458
Two best friends,
both working the soda shop.

36:55.542 --> 36:58.625
Years pass, and everything
goes right for one

36:58.709 --> 37:02.291
but the other one..

37:02.375 --> 37:06.125
She's stuck taking care of a
drunken old man.

37:06.208 --> 37:08.792
'And Rita plays and dances.'

37:08.875 --> 37:11.291
Everything was easy for her.

37:13.250 --> 37:15.709
I just wanted one day
of her luck.

37:18.542 --> 37:20.834
One day..

37:20.917 --> 37:23.750
...when it was easy.

37:23.834 --> 37:25.208
What happened that night, Betty?

37:25.291 --> 37:28.667
I've devoted my life
to helping others.

37:28.750 --> 37:31.458
Helping others
or seeking atonement?

37:31.542 --> 37:32.917
'Well, someone once told me'

37:33.041 --> 37:34.250
'God shines his light'

37:34.333 --> 37:36.792
on those who ask
for forgiveness.

37:44.625 --> 37:46.125
I hope so.

37:58.000 --> 38:01.291
Rita!

38:01.375 --> 38:03.458
Oh.

38:03.542 --> 38:05.959
Betty? What's wrong?

38:06.041 --> 38:07.792
You told me to come
by
after the date.

38:07.875 --> 38:10.375
Here I am.

38:10.458 --> 38:13.125
Sit down, Bets.
You don't look too good.

38:13.208 --> 38:15.542
What's that?

38:15.625 --> 38:17.792
Nothing. It's just another
picture I took.

38:17.875 --> 38:19.542
- It's of you.
- 'Self-portrait.'

38:19.625 --> 38:24.583
Monty found another magazine
that wants to publish me.

38:24.667 --> 38:26.792
I had to come up
with a fake name.

38:26.875 --> 38:30.542
- Stanley Nopell. Get it?
- From your song.

38:30.625 --> 38:31.667
Good one.

38:36.959 --> 38:39.709
What's a girl gotta do
to get a drink around here?

38:39.792 --> 38:42.125
Hey, hey,
haven't
you had enough?

38:53.458 --> 38:56.083
Betty, what happened?

38:56.166 --> 39:00.250
My date went real swell.

39:00.333 --> 39:02.250
Sat down for drinks.

39:02.333 --> 39:06.709
He was excited...
a little nervous.

39:06.792 --> 39:09.166
- Then you know what happened?
- No.

39:09.250 --> 39:10.792
He gave me something.

39:10.875 --> 39:12.417
He did?

39:12.500 --> 39:13.834
Well what did he give you?

39:13.917 --> 39:15.125
This.

39:22.333 --> 39:25.250
He wanted your autograph.

39:25.333 --> 39:27.250
'He only asked me out..'

39:27.333 --> 39:29.125
...so he could meet you.

39:29.208 --> 39:30.583
No.

39:30.667 --> 39:32.417
No, that can't be true.

39:32.500 --> 39:33.750
He came to you that night.

39:33.834 --> 39:37.250
Because he was too nervous
to go to you.

39:37.333 --> 39:38.875
He laughed at me..

39:38.959 --> 39:41.959
...when he realized
I thought we were on a date.

39:42.041 --> 39:43.667
Oh, Betty.

39:43.750 --> 39:46.834
What's it like..

39:46.917 --> 39:48.500
...to always be lucky?

39:51.041 --> 39:53.458
Betty, I'm not lucky.

39:53.542 --> 39:56.083
Harder I work, luckier I get.

39:56.166 --> 39:59.125
The men at the club..

39:59.208 --> 40:01.917
..they stare..

40:02.000 --> 40:03.542
'...stare.'

40:03.625 --> 40:06.291
They never ask me
for my autograph.

40:09.417 --> 40:11.542
They ask me for other things.

40:11.625 --> 40:13.750
Betty, you don't have
to do that.

40:13.834 --> 40:16.959
Come stay here with
me.
Your dad'll be fine.

40:19.458 --> 40:23.000
If I can't make
old Blue Eyes happy..

40:23.083 --> 40:24.917
...then you should.

40:25.000 --> 40:27.583
You make everyone happy!

40:27.667 --> 40:29.625
Life's funny.

40:29.709 --> 40:32.333
Ain't it, kookoo?

40:32.417 --> 40:34.625
Go ahead. Sign it!

40:36.834 --> 40:38.417
Betty, don't do this.

40:38.500 --> 40:40.000
- Sign it!
- Ow!

40:43.792 --> 40:46.500
Sign it!

40:46.583 --> 40:49.291
Betty.

40:49.375 --> 40:51.417
Betty, it's me. It's Ree.

40:51.500 --> 40:53.667
I'm your friend.

40:53.750 --> 40:56.208
Things can change for you.

40:56.291 --> 40:58.083
I started right where you did.

40:59.583 --> 41:01.625
That's what hurts the most.
