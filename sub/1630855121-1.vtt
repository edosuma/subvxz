Argh! Tell me lad,

06:11.588 --> 06:13.851
have ye spotted any pirate ships
off the coast?

06:14.025 --> 06:16.506
That'’s a negative, Captain,
but I think we'’re getting close.

06:16.680 --> 06:19.509
Hey bud, you wanna
hit us with another of
those trivia questions?

06:19.683 --> 06:20.728
Yeah, let'’s do that again.

06:20.902 --> 06:21.990
Okay...

06:22.164 --> 06:24.122
- Fun fact 32.
- Oh, God.

I think I know this one.

06:29.737 --> 06:31.608
Honey, are there
any easy questions?

06:31.782 --> 06:34.306
Or even better,
how about we play
something else?

06:34.481 --> 06:37.222

no salmon in the Baja.

06:41.009 --> 06:42.271
I'’ll say a dorkfish.

06:42.445 --> 06:44.882
Hey Tommy, is it a dorkfish?

06:45.056 --> 06:47.755
Maybe... or could be
a red-lipped batfish!

06:47.929 --> 06:49.234
- Oh, could it?
- Yes, it could.

in trouble for that.[passenger] Audrey--

07:01.638 --> 07:03.248
Nobody'’s allowed to
say "duh."That'’s so unfair.

07:22.006 --> 07:24.748
Bahia was our first
getaway as a couple
before we were married.

07:24.922 --> 07:25.836
Yes, it was.

07:26.010 --> 07:27.664
Whoa, I'’m gonna yak.

07:27.838 --> 07:29.318
Your daddy
was so romantic back then.

07:29.492 --> 07:30.928
- I still am.
- No, you'’re not.

07:31.102 --> 07:32.930
How long ago was that?

07:33.104 --> 07:36.151
Well, your sister
just turned 15,
so it was 15 years ago.

07:36.325 --> 07:37.239
And nine months.

07:37.413 --> 07:38.588
Exactly.

07:41.199 --> 07:43.114
Ew!

07:44.812 --> 07:47.118
You were quite a shock
to us too, sweetie.

07:47.292 --> 07:48.859
Oh, I feel
so special now.

07:49.033 --> 07:51.427
Hey, hey, hey.
You are special.

07:51.949 --> 07:52.863
Wait, what?

07:53.037 --> 07:54.865
Anyway...

07:55.039 --> 07:58.956
Bahia was where I landed
my first installation gig
with Nixon Oil.

07:59.130 --> 08:00.784
Boring.

08:00.958 --> 08:03.744
No, it'’s not boring,
because after that...

08:03.918 --> 08:05.789
...financially, I knew

08:05.963 --> 08:08.444
that I would be able to
support a family

08:08.618 --> 08:10.664
and marry the woman
that I love.

08:10.838 --> 08:12.796
You mean, marry the woman
you got pregnant?

08:12.970 --> 08:15.016
- Oh, burn!
- Hey, yeah, stop it!

08:15.190 --> 08:16.321
- Endless.
- Stop it. Yeah.

08:16.496 --> 08:18.846
- Why do we have kids?
- I have no idea.

08:19.020 --> 08:20.804
I just hope
we get to see pirates.

08:20.978 --> 08:22.458
Pirates are lame, Tommy.

08:22.632 --> 08:24.460
You'’re one to talk.

08:24.634 --> 08:26.593
The only pirate you know
is the one on the bottle
of Captain Morgan.

08:26.767 --> 08:27.724
- Shut up, Tommy!
- Tommy!

08:27.898 --> 08:29.160
- Audrey!
- That'’s not true!

08:29.334 --> 08:30.727
- Let'’s hope so.
- What do you mean by that?

08:30.901 --> 08:33.034
- What does he mean by that?
- Tommy... He'’s lying.

08:33.208 --> 08:35.297
You'’re only 15.[parent 2] What do you know
about Captain Morgan?

08:35.471 --> 08:36.428
You'’re such a liar, Tommy.

08:41.869 --> 08:43.914
Dad, I think I see it.
Is that it?

08:44.088 --> 08:46.438
Yep, buddy. That'’s her.
El Diamante.

08:46.613 --> 08:47.962
Are you gonna decompose it?

08:48.876 --> 08:51.182
Decommission, genius.

08:51.966 --> 08:53.184
I don'’t know, buddy.

08:53.358 --> 08:56.057
It all depends on
if she passes, you know,

08:56.231 --> 08:59.321
safety measures,
system functionality,
refinery quotas.

08:59.495 --> 09:02.803
Oh, do you want him
- to try that again in English?
- Oh, Audrey.

09:02.977 --> 09:06.197
I will only decommission
a rig like El Diamante

09:06.371 --> 09:08.678
if we can'’t resuscitate her.
It'’s kind of like--

09:08.852 --> 09:10.898
Pulling the plug.

09:12.377 --> 09:13.640
Dad should
decommission you!

09:13.814 --> 09:15.119
And I should
pull your plug!

09:15.293 --> 09:16.294
No, you wouldn'’t.

09:16.468 --> 09:17.600
Shut up.

09:27.654 --> 09:29.612
Hey, were you able
to get an ocean view?

09:31.571 --> 09:33.355
Paul...

09:33.529 --> 09:35.183

09:36.880 --> 09:39.187
Ooh, Dad'’s in trouble.[Audrey] Tommy...

09:39.361 --> 09:42.582
Hey, I don'’t know.
I just thought it would be nice
to stay at that same place.

09:42.756 --> 09:44.801
Hey, uh,
where is this anyway?

09:44.975 --> 09:48.457
Costa Azul.
Nicest hotel in town.

09:48.631 --> 09:51.199

<i>callo de hacha. Aye verdad.</i>

09:54.811 --> 09:56.291

10:02.514 --> 10:06.257
You know, actually,
I think there was a good little
hotel restaurant right up here.

10:08.956 --> 10:11.828
Yeah, Dad.
Looks amazing.
Great choice.

10:12.002 --> 10:14.396
I wonder
what happened to it?[parent 1] Mmm.

11:04.315 --> 11:08.276
Uh-huh. Nicest hotel in town?
Really, Dad?

11:08.450 --> 11:11.409
A lot has changed
since the last time
we were here.

11:11.583 --> 11:13.411
It definitely ain'’t full.

11:13.585 --> 11:16.284
No kidding. I guess
I should have called, huh?[parent 1] Yeah.

11:17.589 --> 11:20.331
Senor, hello. Uh, excuse me.
Do you speak English?

11:22.246 --> 11:24.031
Sir, do you speak English?

11:27.077 --> 11:28.862
He doesn'’t speak English.

11:31.429 --> 11:32.474
No?

11:34.476 --> 11:39.655
<i>De hecho,</i> he doesn'’t
speak anything at all.

11:41.352 --> 11:43.964
You'’re a long way
from home, gringo.

11:45.400 --> 11:48.577
Man, I'’m just down here
for a weekend with my family.

11:48.751 --> 11:52.668
Families don'’t just
come here for the weekend.

11:57.717 --> 11:59.457
Yes.

11:59.631 --> 12:01.938
Yeah, I work for Nixon Oil.
I'’m sure you'’ve heard of us.

12:02.112 --> 12:03.810
I mean, we practically
built this place.

12:16.300 --> 12:18.259

13:19.755 --> 13:20.800

13:29.156 --> 13:30.157

14:21.469 --> 14:22.644
Whoa.

14:23.906 --> 14:25.560
What is it?

14:25.734 --> 14:28.258
Who cares?
Just keep walking.

14:28.432 --> 14:30.521
I never noticed it before.

14:30.695 --> 14:33.089
Tlaloc. The Aztec god.

14:34.438 --> 14:36.136
Why is it here?

14:59.420 --> 15:00.508
Where'’s Tommy?

15:01.901 --> 15:03.859
Tommy. Tommy.

15:04.033 --> 15:04.947
Come on.[Ines] Honey.

15:05.121 --> 15:06.383
Honey.

15:06.557 --> 15:07.732
Tommy.

15:07.907 --> 15:10.518
Come on.
You gotta stay with us.

15:34.672 --> 15:35.935
<i>Gracias.</i>

15:37.980 --> 15:42.158
Oh,
by the way, back there
when you said... protection.

15:43.159 --> 15:45.031
What'’d you mean?
Protection from what?

15:47.163 --> 15:48.599
<i>El Demonio.</i>

15:49.905 --> 15:51.428
<i>El Demonio?</i> The Demon?

15:51.602 --> 15:52.995
Wait! Senor El Rey!

15:55.476 --> 15:56.912
This for you.

16:04.964 --> 16:07.009
That was a very
nice thing to do.

16:07.183 --> 16:10.012
God, I can'’t believe you'’d share
your pirate patch with him.

16:10.186 --> 16:11.405
That'’s fantastic.

16:17.150 --> 16:18.455
<i>Muchas gracias.</i>

16:18.629 --> 16:20.240
No, no, no.
I-- I get it. It'’s the boss.

16:20.414 --> 16:22.503
All right, I will
head out there now.

16:23.678 --> 16:25.071
Okay, I understand.
I got it.

16:26.376 --> 16:27.987
- All right, bye.
- Okay, guys.

16:28.161 --> 16:29.858
We'’re gonna have to
figure out something else

16:30.032 --> 16:32.469
because we'’re not gonna
stay in this town.[Tommy] Aw, man.

16:32.643 --> 16:34.384
Who was that, honey?

16:34.558 --> 16:36.647
The company.

16:36.821 --> 16:39.955
For some reason, they'’re
on my back to get this
inspection done immediately.

16:40.129 --> 16:42.088
NRT is up our ass.

16:42.262 --> 16:45.047
So, look, I'’ll ferry out
to the Diamante,
I'’ll do the inspection.

16:45.221 --> 16:46.918
While I'’m out there,

16:47.093 --> 16:50.748
you book us someplace else
in Ensenada,
someplace nice. Okay?

16:50.922 --> 16:52.881
- Yeah.
- I'’ll be back before sunset.

16:53.055 --> 16:55.101
And you'’re leaving us here?

16:55.927 --> 16:57.190
Here?

16:57.364 --> 16:59.105
What are we supposed to do
in the meantime?

16:59.279 --> 17:01.455
Oh, what are we
supposed to do in the meantime?

17:01.629 --> 17:02.630
Oh, my--
No, no, no, no.

17:02.804 --> 17:03.805
Guys...[Ines] Don'’t.

17:03.979 --> 17:05.111
Guys.

17:05.285 --> 17:07.287
I will only be gone
a few hours, okay?

17:07.461 --> 17:09.332
Are you sure about this, honey?

17:09.506 --> 17:12.248
The sooner I go,
the sooner we can get out
of this place.

17:12.422 --> 17:14.381
And how are you
gonna get there?

17:14.555 --> 17:17.036
Uh, the company says
I got a boat waitin'’ for me
down in the harbor.

17:17.210 --> 17:18.907
Cool. Can I go with you?

17:19.081 --> 17:20.735
No.

17:20.909 --> 17:25.827
Sorry, little man, you are not
quite tall enough for this ride.

17:31.833 --> 17:33.443
-  Hey.
- Hmm?

17:33.617 --> 17:36.098
- Trust me. Okay?
- Mmm.

17:36.272 --> 17:38.361
Besides, Mom,
I'’m pretty sure
people around here

17:38.535 --> 17:39.928
have bigger problems
than worrying about us.

17:40.102 --> 17:41.060
Really?

17:41.234 --> 17:42.626
What is that
supposed to mean?

17:43.584 --> 17:44.585
"Taloc."

17:45.325 --> 17:46.369
T-la-la-loc.

17:46.543 --> 17:47.588
It'’s Tlaloc, guys.

17:47.762 --> 17:49.459
- Yeah.
- It'’s not that hard.

17:49.633 --> 17:51.505
The creepy god
painted everywhere?

17:51.679 --> 17:53.811
Maybe that'’s why
the villagers
are so quiet.

17:53.985 --> 17:55.422
That is just
part of their culture.

17:55.596 --> 17:57.337
And besides, little man,

17:57.511 --> 18:00.340
pirates back in the day
did not have Internet,

18:00.514 --> 18:02.603
so why don'’t we put this away
for a while

18:02.777 --> 18:05.649
and you try being a real pirate. <i>Sí...</i> That'’s a great idea.

18:05.823 --> 18:07.564
Aye, aye, Captain.

18:07.738 --> 18:09.349
I'’ll consider it.

18:11.873 --> 18:15.006
Hmm. Yeah,
we'’re gonna be fine.
But hurry.

18:15.181 --> 18:16.573
-  Bye, Dad.
- Be nice.

18:16.747 --> 18:18.271
Fine.[Ines] Okay.

18:18.445 --> 18:21.404
In the meantime,
we are going to
enjoy the view. Hmm?

18:23.189 --> 18:24.190
You speak English?

18:24.364 --> 18:25.582
A little.

18:25.756 --> 18:27.758
Do me a favor.

18:27.932 --> 18:30.065
Keep an eye
on my family for me,
would you?

18:33.155 --> 18:34.156
<i>Gracias.</i>

18:37.812 --> 18:39.335
Audrey, it'’s only--[Tommy] Can I?

18:39.509 --> 18:41.207
No.
- I'’ll give it to you later.
- Okay, fine.

18:57.223 --> 18:59.268
<i>Hola. Buenos días.</i>

18:59.442 --> 19:01.314

- I'’m with Nixon Oil.
- Ah! <i>Sí.</i>

19:04.447 --> 19:06.362

to the rig from here?

19:06.536 --> 19:09.104
Yes. Uh,
Choco'’s at the shore.

19:09.974 --> 19:11.498
Waiting for you.
Right there.

19:11.672 --> 19:14.109
Right. Uh, hey,

19:14.283 --> 19:16.764
Radio out to the rig,
- let '’em know I'’m on my way.
- Absolutely.

19:38.133 --> 19:41.615
Paul Sturges.
Nixon Oil.

19:41.789 --> 19:44.095
Yeah, I think you took me
out to the rig
a few years ago. Right?

19:44.270 --> 19:45.575
<i>Sí, señor.</i> Let'’s get going.

19:45.749 --> 19:47.360
I want to get back
before sunset.

19:47.534 --> 19:48.796
Okay.

19:52.843 --> 19:55.585
- Got it?
- I'’m waiting for the wave.

20:00.590 --> 20:03.376
So, what happened here?

20:04.594 --> 20:05.769
What do you mean, sir?

20:05.943 --> 20:08.685
What do I mean? I mean...

20:08.859 --> 20:10.861
where are all the boats?
Where'’d all the fishermen go?

20:11.035 --> 20:12.428
Where'’d all the people
who live here go?

20:14.909 --> 20:15.997
Things...

20:17.085 --> 20:19.043
very bad, sir.

20:19.218 --> 20:21.568
What-- What do you mean,
things are very bad?

20:25.876 --> 20:27.138
El Diamante...

20:31.926 --> 20:33.362
<i>El Demonio.</i>

20:34.842 --> 20:36.583
The Demon.

20:36.757 --> 20:39.238
Okay.

20:59.823 --> 21:03.000
Hey, I'’m confused.
Why are we stopping again?

21:05.176 --> 21:06.221
Sorry, sir.

21:09.180 --> 21:10.791
I can'’t go past here.

21:10.965 --> 21:11.966
Why not?

21:12.140 --> 21:13.272
Bad vibes.

21:13.446 --> 21:15.491
- Bad vibes?
- Yeah.

21:15.665 --> 21:17.363
Look, Cho-- Choco,
if it'’s more money you need,

21:17.537 --> 21:19.190
- I got money.
- No, no, sir.

21:19.365 --> 21:21.018
I-- I can'’t.

21:21.192 --> 21:22.629
But the boat'’s ready.

21:22.803 --> 21:24.326
I check everything.

21:24.500 --> 21:26.067
Engine is strong like a bull.

21:27.242 --> 21:28.983
Look.

21:29.157 --> 21:32.073
See? Pepe is waiting
for you on the rig.

21:33.814 --> 21:35.294
Yeah, I know Pepe.

21:35.468 --> 21:37.121
He knows everything.

21:37.296 --> 21:38.427
He'’s a good man.

21:40.342 --> 21:41.909
You call when ready.

21:42.083 --> 21:43.911
You know there'’s no
cell service out here, right?

21:44.085 --> 21:45.826
<i>Sí,</i> but you call on radio.

21:46.000 --> 21:48.524
Forget it. I'’ll--
I'’ll get myself back.

21:49.395 --> 21:50.657
Thanks for nothing.

21:50.831 --> 21:51.962
You'’re welcome.

22:10.546 --> 22:12.243
"'’Taloc'’ is the god of rain.

22:12.418 --> 22:14.985
His name means
the nectar of the earth.

22:15.159 --> 22:18.902
He'’s one of the oldest
and most formidable gods
of the Aztec pantheon,

22:19.076 --> 22:21.731
dating back 2,500 years ago.

22:22.863 --> 22:25.822
He was the benevolent giver
of life and water.

22:25.996 --> 22:28.477
But he was also greatly feared.

22:28.651 --> 22:32.133
He could stop the rain
and provoke drought and hunger.

22:32.307 --> 22:34.570
He could hurl the lightning
upon the earth

22:34.744 --> 22:37.051
and unleash
devastating hurricanes.

22:37.225 --> 22:39.488
They even named
a mountain after '’Taloc.'’"

22:39.662 --> 22:41.360
It'’s Tlaloc, baby.

22:42.317 --> 22:44.145
Something'’s off.

22:44.319 --> 22:46.103
What is it that
I'’m not getting here?

22:46.277 --> 22:47.888
There'’s no birds.

22:48.845 --> 22:51.282
"He was the ruler
of the third sun,"

22:51.457 --> 22:54.851
and this other guy whose name
I won'’t even try to pronounce

22:55.025 --> 22:57.071
stole his girlfriend.

22:57.245 --> 22:59.073
"Then afterwards,
he became so angry

22:59.247 --> 23:01.771
that he ignored everyone'’s
prayers for rain."

23:02.642 --> 23:04.470
Wicked.

23:05.384 --> 23:07.211
No. Jerk move.

23:08.212 --> 23:10.127
Kinda like how
Ross cheated on Rachel.

23:10.301 --> 23:13.392
He didn'’t cheat on her.
They were on break.

23:16.090 --> 23:17.483
I need to use the bathroom.

23:17.657 --> 23:19.136
Make it quick, okay?

23:21.704 --> 23:23.358
Boy, that kid'’s impressionable.

23:24.925 --> 23:27.493
Are you fighting because of
Rachel and Ross?

23:29.538 --> 23:31.758
Ah, okay, enough of this.

23:34.500 --> 23:36.763
Ugh, can you do it?[Audrey] All right.

24:15.541 --> 24:17.194
Mom?

24:19.545 --> 24:21.242
Audrey! Behind me!

24:21.416 --> 24:22.461
Come.

24:26.247 --> 24:27.944
Tommy![Audrey] Here.

24:28.118 --> 24:30.556
Stay here.
Stay with me.[Audrey] Tommy. Here.

24:40.000 --> 24:41.305
Run!

24:49.313 --> 24:50.358
Uh, Mom?

24:55.058 --> 24:58.061
Audrey?
Audrey, run!

25:02.065 --> 25:03.110
Uh, Mom?

25:04.198 --> 25:06.461
Mom? Mom, I think
we'’re being followed.

25:06.635 --> 25:09.551
Ignore them, Audrey.
No one is allowed to
assault you ever.

25:09.725 --> 25:12.467
Not even disrespect you, okay?
And that goes for you, too.

25:12.641 --> 25:14.513
I'’m gonna get us out of here.
I promise.

25:20.562 --> 25:21.955
<i>Sí, El Diamante.</i>

25:22.129 --> 25:24.784
Mom?

25:27.134 --> 25:28.439
Mom!

25:28.614 --> 25:29.919
I got this, baby, okay?

25:37.013 --> 25:38.928
<i>Muchas gracias.</i> Thank you.

26:43.210 --> 26:44.864
Jesus,
where is everyone?

27:01.358 --> 27:02.925
Hello?

27:07.756 --> 27:09.149
Pepe?

27:15.982 --> 27:16.983
Anybody?

27:25.687 --> 27:27.471
What the hell is this?

27:29.778 --> 27:31.301
Hey, Pepe!

27:33.956 --> 27:36.219
Corporate'’s
not gonna go for this.

27:38.265 --> 27:39.788
Hello?

27:44.271 --> 27:45.881
Pepe!

27:48.144 --> 27:50.973
<i>Hola, Pepe!</i>

27:52.148 --> 27:54.020
Hello? Pepe?

27:57.893 --> 27:59.242
Pepe.

28:03.203 --> 28:04.595
Is there anyone here?

28:11.341 --> 28:12.691
Pepe?

28:21.047 --> 28:23.571
Aw, hey, girl,
you here all alone?

28:23.745 --> 28:26.530
No, <i>señor.</i>
No, he'’s not.

28:26.705 --> 28:29.403
Take it easy with that.
I'’m just looking for Pepe.

28:29.577 --> 28:31.100
Pepe is dead.

28:31.274 --> 28:32.841
Who are you <i>cabrón?</i>

28:33.015 --> 28:35.626
My name is Paul Sturges.
I'’m-- I'’m with Nixon Oil.

28:36.279 --> 28:37.890
What'’s going on here?

28:38.064 --> 28:40.153
Didn'’t the harbor master
tell you guys I was on my way?

28:42.242 --> 28:43.460
No.

28:44.461 --> 28:46.072
Our radio is dead.

28:46.246 --> 28:47.987
I never thought I'’d see
a guy from the company again.

28:48.161 --> 28:50.859
I-- I-- I'’m just here
to do the inspection.

28:51.033 --> 28:52.382
- Oh, is that right?
- Yeah.

28:52.556 --> 28:55.124
Yeah. Little late,
huh, <i>guero?</i>

28:55.298 --> 28:56.343
You alone?

28:57.257 --> 28:59.694
Yeah.
Yeah, of course I'’m alone.

28:59.868 --> 29:01.609
Where the hell is everyone?

29:03.045 --> 29:04.655
- How'’d you get here?
- Shh.

29:05.961 --> 29:07.876
The--
The little motorboat.

29:10.966 --> 29:12.533
<i>Chinga.</i>

29:17.146 --> 29:19.932
<i>Chinga? Chinga</i> what?

29:27.591 --> 29:29.245
A family? Let me see.

29:31.900 --> 29:33.684
Yes, what the hell?

29:47.655 --> 29:49.788
Hey, Tommy,
get away from the edge, okay?

29:52.094 --> 29:53.792
Mom, what'’s that?

29:58.622 --> 29:59.536
Did you not hear me?

29:59.710 --> 30:01.190
Mom?

30:09.503 --> 30:10.809
What are you doing?

30:12.985 --> 30:15.074
What-- Why are you doing that?
Stop doing that!

30:15.248 --> 30:16.945
What the--

30:17.119 --> 30:18.773
There'’s Dad
and some other guys.

30:18.947 --> 30:20.296
Is he?

30:21.515 --> 30:22.821
What is happening?

30:24.823 --> 30:27.303
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa!

30:27.477 --> 30:31.133
- Mom, what'’s going on?
- I don'’t know, baby.
But hold tight. Hold tight!

30:31.307 --> 30:32.874
Where is that
coming from?

30:33.048 --> 30:34.223
- That'’s where!
- What?

30:38.662 --> 30:40.708
Whoa!

30:40.882 --> 30:42.753
Are you okay, guys?
Keep your hands in the boat.

30:49.543 --> 30:51.110
Go with Daddy.
Go with Daddy.

30:53.199 --> 30:54.678
What'’s happening, babe?

30:54.853 --> 30:56.463
Babe, what are you doing?
Why are you here?

30:56.637 --> 30:58.508
What is that?

31:00.380 --> 31:01.947
Pa?

31:02.121 --> 31:03.470
- Why are you here?
- We couldn'’t stay there, okay?

31:20.530 --> 31:23.446
There were-- were.
The body! There'’s bodies!
All of them dead!

31:23.620 --> 31:25.622
There are-- there were--[Ines] Hey, hey.
There'’s nothing there.

31:25.796 --> 31:27.276
- There'’s nothing there.
- Just breathe.

31:27.450 --> 31:29.017
But there were--
But I saw--Baby, you'’re fine.

31:29.191 --> 31:30.627
- Just breathe.
- But I saw all of them.

31:30.801 --> 31:32.325
It'’s just oil.
It'’s okay.

31:32.499 --> 31:33.892
All right, let'’s get her
cleaned up and dried off.

31:34.066 --> 31:35.154
You'’re okay.
- You'’re okay.
- Got her?

31:35.328 --> 31:36.895
- Here, Tommy.
- Lets get you dry.

31:37.069 --> 31:38.592
Get you dry
and cleaned up, okay?

31:41.638 --> 31:43.292
I'’ll be right there
with you, okay?

31:44.467 --> 31:45.860
- What is happening here?
- What'’s happening?

31:46.034 --> 31:47.253
- What made the boat sink?
- Why did he leave?

31:47.427 --> 31:48.602
- What is going on?
- Why did he leave?

31:48.776 --> 31:50.691
- What did she see?
- What did she see, huh?

31:50.865 --> 31:53.389
- You don'’t wanna know.
- No, we do wanna know.
What'’s happening?

31:54.564 --> 31:55.652
What is it?

32:09.840 --> 32:10.972
What is that?

32:25.291 --> 32:26.814
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

32:29.773 --> 32:31.036
Jesus Christ.

32:31.688 --> 32:32.733
No.

32:33.603 --> 32:34.604
The Black Demon.

32:35.866 --> 32:36.998
Where are my kids?

33:08.377 --> 33:09.378
<i>Gracias.</i>

33:16.646 --> 33:18.953
Hey. Careful, it'’s hot.

33:24.132 --> 33:25.394
Baby, here.

33:26.569 --> 33:30.008
Hey, I wasn'’t mad at you
back there, okay?

34:18.404 --> 34:20.449
Don'’t try to
understand it, <i>guero.</i>

34:21.755 --> 34:23.844
Just accept that it'’s real
and alive.

34:25.541 --> 34:27.369
How long
has that thing
been out there?

34:28.370 --> 34:29.458
I don'’t know.

34:30.329 --> 34:31.808
I'’ve lost track of time.

34:35.986 --> 34:37.814
<i>Me llamo Chato.</i>

34:41.166 --> 34:42.254
Chato.

34:43.907 --> 34:45.300
And where'’s the rest
of the crew?

34:45.474 --> 34:48.564
Gone.
Some managed to evacuate.

34:48.738 --> 34:51.350
Others, not so lucky.

34:51.524 --> 34:54.092
Me and Junior,
we were the only ones
smart enough to stay.

34:55.484 --> 34:56.659
Smart enough?

34:57.747 --> 34:58.792
Paul?

35:00.141 --> 35:01.882
I-- I-- I can'’t
get any signal.

35:02.056 --> 35:03.188
There'’s no signal.

35:03.362 --> 35:04.928
There'’s no service.

35:06.626 --> 35:09.107
What'’s going on?
What'’s that thing we saw?

35:10.020 --> 35:11.283
I don'’t know.

35:11.457 --> 35:13.415
Oh, that poor man.

35:13.589 --> 35:15.678
I ask him to come here
and I treat him like shit.

35:15.852 --> 35:18.986
No, no, baby.
Hey, listen to me.
Listen to me.

35:19.160 --> 35:22.250
It'’s not your fault.
You couldn'’t have known.
None of us could.

35:23.860 --> 35:25.253
What is that then?

35:26.907 --> 35:28.256
Some kind of shark.

35:29.170 --> 35:30.563
It'’s not a shark.

35:32.478 --> 35:33.696
It'’s a megalodon.

35:33.870 --> 35:36.264
Those don'’t exist.

35:36.438 --> 35:39.137
Guys,
I told you to stay inside.
What are you doing here?

35:39.311 --> 35:41.313
Hey, look. There must be
some other way
off this rig.

35:41.487 --> 35:43.315
Do you think
we'’d be here if there was?

35:43.489 --> 35:46.231
Radio stopped working weeks ago.
Our calls went ignored.

35:46.405 --> 35:48.189
-  Ignored?
- Ignored?
What do you mean?

35:48.363 --> 35:50.583
What-- What about
- the satellite phone?
- It was taken with the crew.

35:50.757 --> 35:52.976
Look. If you'’re gonna ask me
questions about boats,

35:53.151 --> 35:55.501
phones or some other way
of getting off this damn rig,

35:55.675 --> 35:57.938
then we'’re gonna be here
for a long time.

35:58.112 --> 35:59.157
Who'’s this little guy?

35:59.331 --> 36:01.246
That'’s Toro.

36:01.420 --> 36:03.161
Tough name
for a little dog.

36:05.467 --> 36:07.382
Don'’t look him
in the eye then.

36:13.867 --> 36:16.043
What?
Do you think
I made that up?

36:19.133 --> 36:21.918
Guess he'’s not that tough
after all, huh?

36:23.964 --> 36:25.226
What was that?

36:25.400 --> 36:26.706
That'’s coming from
the southern leg.

36:26.880 --> 36:28.098
It'’s trying to bring
the rig down.

36:28.273 --> 36:29.665
The southern leg
holds the auxiliary line.

36:29.839 --> 36:32.364
Ines, get the kids downstairs
and inside, all right?

36:32.538 --> 36:34.409
I'’m going to
- figure this out.
- Okay.

36:34.583 --> 36:36.106
Where?[Ines] We'’re going inside.

36:36.281 --> 36:38.065
What exactly are
your jobs on the rig?

36:38.239 --> 36:40.502
I do whatever is needed.

36:40.676 --> 36:43.375
Me and my <i>carnal</i> are
trying to keep this hunk of shit
from falling into the ocean.

36:43.549 --> 36:44.985
Hunk of shit
is putting it mildly.

36:45.159 --> 36:47.466
All right, give me
a complete rundown on Diamante.

36:47.640 --> 36:50.643
Control room, electrical,
standard satellite,
the whole thing.

36:50.817 --> 36:53.646
Rundown?
Nothing works.
That'’s your rundown.

36:53.820 --> 36:55.082
Nothing works.

36:56.257 --> 36:58.781
And how often does this thing
hit the rig?

37:00.522 --> 37:01.654
<i>El Demonio</i>
attacks when it wants.

37:01.828 --> 37:03.438
- What about the volume?
- Zero.

37:03.612 --> 37:06.049
Spillage has been nonstop
- for the past few months.
- Zero?

37:07.660 --> 37:10.576
Are you shitting me?
This thing has been leaking
this bad for months?

37:12.186 --> 37:14.797
All those <i>pendejos</i>
at Nixon Oil knew all about it.

37:14.971 --> 37:17.539
We just wondered why you guys
never sent the resources
to fix it.

37:17.713 --> 37:19.280
That'’s absurd.

37:19.454 --> 37:22.370
Does all this damage
look absurd to you, <i>guero?</i>
Huh?

37:22.544 --> 37:24.807
Let me tell you something.
We grew up here.

37:27.114 --> 37:28.898
So when
we heard about all these
<i>pinches problemas</i>

37:29.072 --> 37:31.205
this place was having,
we transferred back.

37:31.379 --> 37:33.468
To see all this? No.

37:34.339 --> 37:35.731
I'’m sorry, man.

37:37.603 --> 37:39.257
If we live through this,

37:39.431 --> 37:41.694
I'’m gonna gather up
all of them bigwig
son of a bitches

37:41.868 --> 37:43.435
and feed their <i>huevos</i>
to Toro.

37:49.789 --> 37:50.877
Jesus.

37:51.051 --> 37:52.705
Yeah,
support'’s been fractured.

37:52.879 --> 37:54.794
I don'’t think it can take
much more punishment.

37:54.968 --> 37:58.188
No, it'’s fine.
She'’s designed to withstand
a category five.

38:02.541 --> 38:04.760
Does that feel
like a category five, <i>guero?</i>

38:04.934 --> 38:06.458
The auxiliary
is still working.

38:09.896 --> 38:11.376
There goes the auxiliary.

38:12.942 --> 38:13.856
<i>Chinga.</i>

38:14.030 --> 38:15.902
What now?

38:18.383 --> 38:20.167
We need power.

38:20.341 --> 38:23.779
Without the auxiliary line,
the backup generator won'’t work.

38:23.953 --> 38:25.912
Where is it?
This line.

38:26.086 --> 38:28.001
This line.
This line here.

38:28.175 --> 38:31.657
Then I can repair
and reroute the radio,
and we can call for help.

38:31.831 --> 38:33.746
You mean dive?

38:35.574 --> 38:37.358
Is the dive bell
still functional?

38:37.532 --> 38:38.490
- Simón.
- Yeah?

38:40.666 --> 38:43.233
Dad. Carnaroni?

38:43.408 --> 38:46.672
Yeah, bud.
That'’s what they eat
down here.

38:46.846 --> 38:49.370
Well, they'’re not
my <i>abuelita'’s</i> enchiladas,
but...

38:49.544 --> 38:50.980
...they'’ll keep you full.

38:51.154 --> 38:52.765
Hey, we'’re much better,
<i>verdad, mi amor?</i>

38:52.939 --> 38:54.941
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

38:55.115 --> 38:58.248
So, listen. I think I found
a way to fix the radio
and get us out of here.

38:58.423 --> 38:59.815
- What?
- Okay.

38:59.989 --> 39:02.427
- So, we have a plan, right?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

39:02.601 --> 39:06.605
Why don'’t we open this window
so we can lighten up this place?
Help me there.

39:06.779 --> 39:08.868
If the auxiliary line
can be repaired,

39:09.042 --> 39:11.131
we'’re gonna have to do
some work down there.

39:11.305 --> 39:12.785
You know how to weld?

39:12.959 --> 39:14.569
A-- A bit. Yeah.

39:14.743 --> 39:17.224
A bit?
It'’s okay.

39:17.398 --> 39:19.357
We'’ll go down.
You stay up top.

39:19.531 --> 39:21.184
We'’ll be faster.

39:22.055 --> 39:24.100
I'’ll prep the--
the tanks.

39:25.363 --> 39:27.277
All right,
so I'’ll retract you
down in the bell.

39:27.452 --> 39:28.888
You fix the line.

39:29.062 --> 39:30.672
Hey, wait. You aren'’t
actually going down there?

39:30.846 --> 39:32.805
Did you just forget about
the 70-ton shark out there?

39:32.979 --> 39:36.156
Babe, the bell on this rig
is made of thick
fine-grained steel.

39:36.330 --> 39:39.159
I'’d like to see
that son of a bitch
bite down on it.

39:39.333 --> 39:40.552
- It'’ll be fine.
- Paul...

39:40.726 --> 39:43.119
It'’ll be fine.[Junior] Hey, kids.

39:43.293 --> 39:45.470
There'’s a chess board,
some books and games.

39:45.644 --> 39:47.036
If you want to use them--

39:47.210 --> 39:49.952
We are not exactly trying
to get comfortable here!

39:50.126 --> 39:51.258
I'’m sorry, I--

39:52.607 --> 39:54.957
So-- Actually--
Actually, it'’s a great idea.

39:56.132 --> 39:58.221
Why would a shark be
so interested in an oil rig?

39:58.396 --> 39:59.397
Well...

40:01.573 --> 40:02.835
your company...

40:03.009 --> 40:05.359
this rig, was to provide jobs.

40:05.533 --> 40:08.144
A better future
for Bahia Azul.

40:10.538 --> 40:12.235
And it did, at first,

40:13.976 --> 40:17.676
until regulation standards
started getting
more and more overlooked.

40:20.374 --> 40:22.332
Nobody gave a shit. Nobody.

40:24.073 --> 40:27.816
You know, this is not
just any shark.

40:27.990 --> 40:29.731
Not just a megalodon.

40:31.037 --> 40:32.647
What is it then?

40:33.692 --> 40:35.302
It'’s much more than that.

40:37.478 --> 40:38.392
It'’s a curse.

40:40.263 --> 40:44.224
Curse? Come on, man.
Now'’s not the time for this.

40:44.398 --> 40:46.574
Paul, let him talk. Please.

40:46.748 --> 40:48.707
<i>El Demonio</i>
is an extension.

40:49.969 --> 40:52.841
It'’s the vengeance
of an old god.

40:53.015 --> 40:55.104
You know,
when I was a-- a boy,

40:55.278 --> 40:58.194
my <i>abuelito</i> would always
tell me stories about
the god of rain.

40:58.368 --> 40:59.369
"Taloc."

40:59.544 --> 41:00.719
Tlaloc.

41:00.893 --> 41:02.329
Hey, baby, <i>ven.</i>

41:02.503 --> 41:04.810
<i>Mi abuelito</i>
would always remind me

41:04.984 --> 41:07.073
that Tlaloc was not
just any god.

41:07.247 --> 41:09.728
He was a giver of life.

41:09.902 --> 41:13.427
That his tears made
the oceans, the lakes, <i>ríos.</i>

41:14.167 --> 41:15.385
And that most importantly,

41:15.560 --> 41:17.605
we only prayed
for what was needed.

41:18.345 --> 41:19.346
Never more.

41:20.695 --> 41:23.306
Thousands of years ago,
that was not the case.

41:23.481 --> 41:26.092
A great flood came through.

41:26.266 --> 41:29.399
A flood brought on
not by nature,

41:30.662 --> 41:31.663
but by wrath.

41:31.837 --> 41:33.403
Wrath?

41:35.754 --> 41:37.843
You know,
people took too much.

41:38.017 --> 41:40.410
They chopped down all the trees.

41:40.585 --> 41:42.500
Instead of just taking
what they needed to eat,

41:42.674 --> 41:44.632
they killed--
they killed all the animals.

41:44.806 --> 41:47.330
And they tried to control
the rivers and the lakes.

41:48.506 --> 41:50.464
They thought
they were in control.

41:51.247 --> 41:52.945
We thought we were the gods.

41:54.294 --> 41:55.817
That'’s what pissed him off.

41:56.905 --> 41:58.994
And Tlaloc'’s warning
went ignored.

41:59.168 --> 42:02.476
Until <i>El Demonio Negro</i> was born.

42:02.650 --> 42:03.912
Here we go.

42:04.086 --> 42:06.480
Brought out of extinction
by Tlaloc himself.

42:06.654 --> 42:10.353
You see,
that was no ordinary meg.

42:10.528 --> 42:13.966
Makes you see things,
plays games with your mind.

42:14.140 --> 42:16.577
Please.[Chato] You don'’t believe me?

42:16.751 --> 42:18.623
Let'’s ask your daughter
what she saw. Let'’s ask her.

42:18.797 --> 42:19.798
Hey.[Paul] Hey, hey.

42:19.972 --> 42:21.495
What did you see, Paul?

42:24.063 --> 42:27.849
We are destroying
Tlaloc'’s world.

42:28.023 --> 42:30.939
And now the demon has
come back to protect it.

42:31.113 --> 42:32.506
How are we gonna stop it?

42:32.680 --> 42:34.552
The only way to stop it
is to kill it.

42:34.726 --> 42:37.424
But killing the demon
is not gonna stop Tlaloc.

42:37.598 --> 42:39.252
He'’s gonna keep
getting his revenge

42:39.426 --> 42:41.559
until an ultimate sacrifice
has been made.

42:42.298 --> 42:43.430
Now, you'’ve seen it.

42:43.604 --> 42:46.215
This entire place
is a wasteland.

42:46.389 --> 42:49.654
And everything that was sacred
or gave us life

42:50.872 --> 42:52.352
has been killed.

42:53.005 --> 42:54.310
It'’s "Taloc."

42:54.484 --> 42:56.399
That'’s why it was so dusty
back in Bahia.

42:56.574 --> 42:58.184
"Taloc" won'’t let it rain.

42:59.751 --> 43:02.101
It'’s Tla-loc.

43:04.016 --> 43:05.844
Tla... loc.

43:06.714 --> 43:07.976
Tla...

43:08.803 --> 43:10.152
Ta... Tla...

43:10.326 --> 43:12.807
Ta... T-la...

43:12.981 --> 43:14.026
Tla...

43:14.200 --> 43:15.723
- Loc.
- Tlaloc.

43:18.813 --> 43:20.685
What'’s that?

43:20.859 --> 43:22.600
Hmm.

43:25.690 --> 43:26.691
<i>Gracias.</i>

43:27.953 --> 43:29.041
Tlaloc.
Tlaloc.

43:29.215 --> 43:32.174
Enough! So, that'’s your answer?

43:32.348 --> 43:34.568
Everything that'’s gone wrong
- with this world?
- Paul...

43:34.742 --> 43:38.050
No, no, no. Come on, man.
Angry gods? Ultimate sacrifice?

43:38.224 --> 43:40.052
- Paul, will you please stop?
- No. No. No.

43:40.226 --> 43:41.967
I'’m not gonna sit here
and listen to him

43:42.141 --> 43:44.752
fill our children'’s heads
with superstitious nonsense.

43:44.926 --> 43:46.885
They have enough to worry about
as it is, for Chrissake.

43:47.059 --> 43:49.061
Open your eyes, <i>cabrón.</i>

43:49.235 --> 43:50.802
We are destroying
our own planet.

43:55.371 --> 43:58.026
We gotta do this now.
We gotta do this.

44:02.074 --> 44:03.379
Hey.

44:03.553 --> 44:06.644
No, no, no, no, no.
Don'’t you--

44:06.818 --> 44:08.820
Do not listen
to what he'’s saying.

44:08.994 --> 44:10.212
He'’s gone crazy.

44:10.386 --> 44:12.258
Are you sure about that?

44:12.432 --> 44:15.130
Baby, we can'’t exactly deny
what we'’re dealing with.

44:15.304 --> 44:18.133
There is a giant shark
out there, and you saw it!

44:21.963 --> 44:23.269
Paul...

44:33.627 --> 44:35.020
Bell'’s on battery!

44:42.157 --> 44:45.552
What do you think? Lowering
it manually should make
it much brighter down below.

44:45.726 --> 44:47.946
So, you do believe
it'’s Tlaloc?

44:48.120 --> 44:51.123
No. But I know
a big-ass shark
when I see one.

44:55.997 --> 44:58.826
He really seems
to like you, <i>guero.</i>

44:59.000 --> 45:00.610
Always making noise
when you'’re around.

45:00.785 --> 45:02.090
Funny. Ha-ha.

45:02.264 --> 45:05.354
Remember. The intake valves
are 200 feet down.

45:05.528 --> 45:07.879
No, no. <i>Más.</i>
Seventy-five meters.

45:08.053 --> 45:09.271
Do those comms work?

45:09.445 --> 45:11.143
No.
But we have cameras.

45:11.317 --> 45:13.623
You can watch us with this.
We'’ll signal you when we stop.

46:11.116 --> 46:12.813
[Chato] All right.

46:12.987 --> 46:14.772
A little bit. A little bit.
A little bit.

47:36.549 --> 47:38.377
I hear you, tough guy.

48:07.797 --> 48:08.842
What is that?

50:03.739 --> 50:06.177
Come on!

50:16.056 --> 50:17.666
Stay put.[Audrey] What happened?

50:17.840 --> 50:18.841
Hey.

50:19.016 --> 50:21.061
[Ines] Chato!

50:21.235 --> 50:24.064
Where'’s Junior?
- Where'’s Junior?
- Are you okay?

50:24.238 --> 50:27.198
- Where'’s Junior? Where is he?
- Where is Junior? What happened?

50:28.808 --> 50:30.853
- Help him out! Help him out!
- Junior!

50:31.028 --> 50:32.072
<i>Hermano.</i> Junior!

50:32.246 --> 50:34.727
- Help him out! Help him out!
- Junior!

50:37.991 --> 50:39.471
Help him out!
Help him out!

50:44.693 --> 50:47.218
Oh, my God! Junior!

50:54.747 --> 50:55.878
Junior!

50:58.533 --> 50:59.839
What?

51:01.580 --> 51:03.060
What'’s wrong, Audrey?

51:03.712 --> 51:05.366
No, nothing.

51:05.540 --> 51:07.542
Just another one of
Mom and Dad'’s fights.

51:07.716 --> 51:09.370
Oh, God.

51:12.504 --> 51:14.419
Junior.

51:17.900 --> 51:20.207
You will not take
my family away from me.

51:30.870 --> 51:33.351
He didn'’t deserve
to die like that, Paul.

51:33.525 --> 51:35.309
He-- He was--

51:37.964 --> 51:39.661
He was trying to save us.

51:39.835 --> 51:44.623
He--
He didn'’t deserve
to die like that. He--

51:50.498 --> 51:52.152
He didn'’t deserve that.

51:54.198 --> 51:55.677
Baby...

51:55.851 --> 51:57.679
Honey, can I say?

51:57.853 --> 51:59.464
Everything is gonna be
all right.

52:00.726 --> 52:03.163
You keep
telling me that, Paul.

52:03.337 --> 52:05.122
But it'’s not.
It'’s not all right.

52:05.296 --> 52:06.601
It'’s not all right.

52:08.342 --> 52:10.692
Hey, Paul. Hey, I'’m not--

52:10.866 --> 52:13.913
I'’m not asking you to be
completely invested
in what he'’s saying,

52:14.087 --> 52:16.394
but you can'’t tell me
this is normal. Come on.

52:16.568 --> 52:18.744
How does that help you?
How does that help you?

52:18.918 --> 52:22.226
I don'’t know!
But there'’s some things
that we can'’t explain.

52:22.400 --> 52:25.403
I just need you
to acknowledge that,
at least while we'’re here.

52:25.577 --> 52:27.796
Here? You are not
supposed to be here!

52:27.970 --> 52:32.192
I specifically told you
to wait with the kids
and you blatantly ignored me!

52:36.849 --> 52:39.068
You'’re right.
You'’re right.

52:39.243 --> 52:40.940
I'’m sorry. I'’m sorry.

52:42.028 --> 52:43.160
I'’m so sorry.

52:44.987 --> 52:48.252
But I just couldn'’t
stay there with those drunks
and Santa Muerte cult!

52:48.426 --> 52:50.384
I couldn'’t! I couldn'’t!

52:50.558 --> 52:53.518
And you told me it would last
just a couple of hours tops!

52:54.954 --> 52:58.436
I... I thought it would be.

52:58.610 --> 53:00.829
I did. I really thought
it would be.

53:01.569 --> 53:02.527
I'’m sorry.

53:03.397 --> 53:04.964
I'’m sorry.

53:05.138 --> 53:07.532
I know,
I know you'’re scared.

53:11.100 --> 53:12.580
It'’s not just us.

53:13.755 --> 53:15.061
The kids.

53:16.932 --> 53:19.674
Baby, if something were
to happen to them,

53:20.545 --> 53:22.155
I don'’t know what
I would do.

53:22.329 --> 53:24.201
I am working on it.

53:24.375 --> 53:27.160
I promise you,
- I am working on it.
- Okay.

53:29.293 --> 53:31.208
Are you guys done
arguing yet?

53:31.382 --> 53:33.819
Hey, hey.

53:33.993 --> 53:36.082
No, no, no.
We-- We weren'’t arguing.

53:37.736 --> 53:38.650
What'’s this?

53:38.824 --> 53:40.478
- Coffee.
- Coffee for me?

53:41.348 --> 53:42.741
Oh, thank you.

53:42.915 --> 53:44.743
I need to go check
on Toro.

53:44.917 --> 53:46.745
Oh, by the way,
where'’s Junior?

53:54.840 --> 53:56.581
He'’s in
the electrical room.

53:56.755 --> 53:58.278
He'’ll be back soon, Tommy.

53:59.018 --> 54:00.062
Okay.

54:22.737 --> 54:23.738
New shirt?

54:27.916 --> 54:29.396
Junior gave me
that shirt.

54:30.658 --> 54:31.572
Shit.

54:31.746 --> 54:33.182
Can'’t wear it right now.

54:33.966 --> 54:34.967
I'’m sorry, man.

54:36.403 --> 54:38.057
I'’m sorry about
your partner.

54:44.629 --> 54:46.544
He gave me ten years
of his life.

54:49.068 --> 54:51.505
Met him down south in a rig
when he was 20.

54:52.201 --> 54:53.420
He never complained.

54:54.595 --> 54:57.250
He always did
what I asked him to do.

55:01.428 --> 55:02.429
Did you see it?

55:05.824 --> 55:07.042
I did.

55:09.741 --> 55:11.656
It'’s enough firepower
to flatten...

55:15.529 --> 55:16.530
Why?

55:20.012 --> 55:21.492
How much time
do we have?

55:24.059 --> 55:25.409
I don'’t know.

55:33.155 --> 55:35.114
Hey, look. Hey! Hey!

55:35.288 --> 55:37.595
Over here! Over here!
- Get your gun!
- What'’s going on? No.

55:37.769 --> 55:40.206
-  No!
- Get your flare gun!
Where is it?

55:40.380 --> 55:41.555
There'’s nothing there!

55:41.729 --> 55:43.601
- No! Give me that!
- What are you doing?

55:43.775 --> 55:45.516
The ship is right there!
Don'’t you see it?

55:45.690 --> 55:47.082
Right there, look! <i>Mira!</i>

55:47.256 --> 55:49.258
- Look! Look!
- There'’s nothing out there!

55:54.655 --> 55:56.744
How many times
do I have to tell you?

55:57.615 --> 55:58.964
It makes you see things!

55:59.138 --> 56:01.270
It plays games with your mind.

56:05.231 --> 56:07.842
The only <i>cabrónes</i>
we can rely on right now...

56:15.023 --> 56:16.285
<i>El Demonio,</i> this spill.

56:17.939 --> 56:20.246
This is Mother Nature
holding us accountable.

56:21.508 --> 56:22.727
This is our problem.

56:27.688 --> 56:29.386
The spill?

56:30.691 --> 56:33.041
The hell with the spill.

56:33.215 --> 56:35.783
It'’s not my fault.
I'’m not God.

56:36.915 --> 56:39.004
- No.
- I didn'’t create
that thing out there.

56:40.397 --> 56:41.398
You'’re not God.

56:42.573 --> 56:44.052
More like
a <i>pinche</i> puppet.

56:44.226 --> 56:48.274
Yeah, yeah, yeah, man.

56:48.448 --> 56:51.016
We'’re all puppets
in the end of the day.

56:51.190 --> 56:53.932
The company'’s puppet,
<i>pendejo!</i>

56:54.106 --> 56:56.587
You think God cares
about this shiny watch?

56:57.152 --> 56:58.371
Or your SUVs?

56:59.285 --> 57:00.547
Or this pretty red shirt?

57:00.721 --> 57:03.681
Hey, I paid my dues, pal.
I earned all this.

57:03.855 --> 57:08.381
So you can just take your
superstitious Aztec bullshit
and shove it up your ass,

57:08.555 --> 57:11.079
because I'’m not about
to lose any of it, ever!

57:11.253 --> 57:12.951
And this is burgundy!

57:13.125 --> 57:15.432
You have no idea what you have!

57:15.606 --> 57:17.564
Right?

57:17.738 --> 57:20.175
- Okay, let'’s do it, man!
- Stop it! Stop it!
What'’s going on here?

57:22.569 --> 57:24.353
I'’ll tell you what'’s going on.

57:25.703 --> 57:26.921
This.

57:28.183 --> 57:29.315
All of this.

57:30.621 --> 57:31.970
It'’s just...

57:32.144 --> 57:33.406
It'’s just incompetence.

57:33.580 --> 57:35.103
It'’s negligence.

57:35.887 --> 57:37.279
It'’s mismanagement.

57:38.542 --> 57:39.630
That'’s what it is.

57:39.804 --> 57:41.327
And that thing out there
is just a--

57:41.501 --> 57:44.112
a mutant freak from all of it!

57:58.562 --> 57:59.563
Tommy.

58:00.128 --> 58:01.652
I'’m not hungry.

58:01.826 --> 58:02.827
You need to eat.

58:05.307 --> 58:07.745
- Hey, uh, food?
- Uh, what is that?

58:07.919 --> 58:09.964
Uh, veggie lasagna.
You want?

58:10.138 --> 58:11.662
No. Give it to Toro.

58:11.836 --> 58:13.751
Are we leaving now?

58:13.925 --> 58:17.668
Yeah, but, uh-- but Dad'’s
got some work to do first.

58:18.190 --> 58:19.234
Got it?

58:23.500 --> 58:24.849
- Dad?
- Yeah?

58:25.023 --> 58:26.590
What happened to your mouth?

58:26.764 --> 58:28.548
- What?
- Your mouth.

58:28.722 --> 58:31.072
Oh. I, uh,
slipped on the deck.

58:32.900 --> 58:35.207
Are we gonna die, Dad?

58:35.381 --> 58:36.730
What, baby?

58:36.904 --> 58:38.602
- Hey, hey.
- Hey.

58:38.776 --> 58:41.126
No.[Paul] Hey, buddy.

58:41.300 --> 58:44.042
What kind of a question
is that? No, no, no.
Listen to me.

58:44.216 --> 58:46.000
Sometimes life
just gives us problems

58:46.174 --> 58:48.263
that are bigger than
we think we can handle.

58:48.437 --> 58:51.571
We just need to focus
and take our time
and figure it out.

58:51.745 --> 58:53.878
Kind of like chess,
you know.

58:54.052 --> 58:57.316
With a king and his army.
- Right, Dad?
- Exactly, <i>mi amor.</i>

58:57.490 --> 59:00.145
And all of the pieces
need to work together
in order to win.

59:00.319 --> 59:03.627
Yeah, but sacrifices need to
be made to protect the king.

59:03.801 --> 59:05.150
Hey, what?

59:05.324 --> 59:07.848
In Tlaloc'’s case,
he preferred children,

59:08.022 --> 59:11.548
and it was the tears of children
that created the rivers
and waterways.

59:11.722 --> 59:13.201
Waterways.

59:13.375 --> 59:15.421
You think that'’s
gonna happen to you?

59:15.595 --> 59:18.337
The Aztecs would literally
rip the fingernails

59:18.511 --> 59:21.470
out of their kids
just to get them crying

59:21.645 --> 59:23.429
right before
slitting their throats.

59:23.603 --> 59:25.387
Hey, hey. Buddy, buddy.

59:25.562 --> 59:28.608
Listen to me. There'’ll be
no sacrificing today. Okay?

59:30.175 --> 59:31.219
Yes, Dad.

59:33.918 --> 59:36.007
And when you come back,
we can leave?

59:36.181 --> 59:39.532
Exactly. That'’s what
I'’m trying to figure out.

59:39.706 --> 59:41.447
Hey, hey, listen.
You guys want to help?

59:41.621 --> 59:43.057
Yeah. What?

59:43.231 --> 59:45.582
Okay. So, look around
and find anything that you can

59:45.756 --> 59:47.801
that might help us
get off this rig.

59:47.975 --> 59:49.673
Like what?

59:49.847 --> 59:52.240
I-I don'’t know. You'’re smart.
You'’ll figure it out.

59:52.414 --> 59:53.328
Okay.

59:53.502 --> 59:54.808
Waterways.

59:56.027 --> 59:57.028
Hey, bud.

59:57.202 --> 59:59.944
Wanna help your sister? Huh?

01:00:00.118 --> 01:00:02.207
Oh, <i>mi amor.</i> Mmm.

01:00:02.381 --> 01:00:04.470
I don'’t want you to worry
about a thing, okay?

01:00:05.427 --> 01:00:06.515
I'’ll be right back.

01:00:19.528 --> 01:00:20.573
Paul?

01:00:22.053 --> 01:00:23.054
Paul.

01:00:23.228 --> 01:00:24.925
Hey. Baby.

01:00:25.099 --> 01:00:27.536
Hey, come on.
You can'’t do this by yourself.

01:00:27.711 --> 01:00:28.842
Why the hell not?

01:00:29.016 --> 01:00:31.323
If this is teamwork,
let him help you.

01:00:31.497 --> 01:00:33.934
What, so he can slap
the shit out of me again?

01:00:35.762 --> 01:00:36.763
Paul!

01:00:46.773 --> 01:00:48.732
You want to
tell me what you'’re doing?

01:00:48.906 --> 01:00:50.429
I have a new plan.

01:00:50.603 --> 01:00:52.300
We'’ve been over this.

01:00:52.474 --> 01:00:54.781
I'’ve shown you
every blueprint I can find.

01:00:54.955 --> 01:00:56.217
What are you looking for?

01:00:57.784 --> 01:00:58.872
- Waterways.
- What?

01:01:00.395 --> 01:01:01.701
- Waterways.
- Waterways?

01:01:01.875 --> 01:01:03.268
Yeah.

01:01:03.442 --> 01:01:04.486
Okay, the generator.

01:01:07.925 --> 01:01:10.623
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
The drain.

01:01:10.797 --> 01:01:12.103
Where'’s the drain?

01:01:12.277 --> 01:01:13.757
The drain? Okay.

01:01:13.931 --> 01:01:17.543
If I can reroute
the cooling system,

01:01:17.717 --> 01:01:19.197
I can get the generator
to work.

01:01:21.416 --> 01:01:23.201
Okay, <i>guero.</i> Okay.

01:01:27.074 --> 01:01:30.034
Maybe we can fix
the radio.

01:01:32.601 --> 01:01:35.169
It'’s stuck.

01:03:09.742 --> 01:03:11.004
And now what?

01:03:13.615 --> 01:03:14.965
Well, you weld, right?

01:03:35.594 --> 01:03:37.596
<i>Mr. Chato.</i>

01:03:39.598 --> 01:03:40.686
<i>Me.</i>

01:03:40.860 --> 01:03:42.470
Tommy,
did you find anything?

01:03:42.644 --> 01:03:43.689
Audrey.

01:03:46.387 --> 01:03:47.954
Mommy.

01:03:50.043 --> 01:03:51.871
Daddy.

01:03:53.568 --> 01:03:55.657
And Tlaloc.

01:03:55.832 --> 01:03:57.355
Tommy, did you find any--

01:04:01.794 --> 01:04:03.100
Tommy?

01:04:10.150 --> 01:04:11.586
Lord of the sea,

01:04:11.760 --> 01:04:15.460
grant us humble passage
through your turbulent sea.

01:04:15.634 --> 01:04:17.331
Forgive us, Tlaloc.

01:04:39.310 --> 01:04:40.964
Tommy? <i>Listo.</i>

01:04:42.052 --> 01:04:43.705
I don'’t know
if this works.

01:04:56.544 --> 01:04:58.459
-  Tommy?
- Tommy?

01:04:59.330 --> 01:05:00.331
Tommy!

01:05:01.071 --> 01:05:02.681
Help, Audrey!

01:05:02.855 --> 01:05:04.813
- Where is he?
- I don'’t know.
I thought he was with you!

01:05:04.988 --> 01:05:07.294
- No. Tommy? Tommy!
- Help, Mommy! Help!

01:05:08.774 --> 01:05:11.429
Ines! Ines!

01:05:13.387 --> 01:05:14.911
Mom! Mom, help!

01:05:27.314 --> 01:05:29.926
- Okay.
- Hey! Hey!

01:05:31.057 --> 01:05:32.754
- Hey, Mom!
- Audrey!

01:05:32.929 --> 01:05:34.582
Hey!

01:05:36.367 --> 01:05:39.587
Here it comes, <i>guero!</i>
Come on! Come on!

01:05:41.546 --> 01:05:42.895
Go, Tommy! Go, go!

01:05:45.071 --> 01:05:46.638
<i>Vamos! Vamos!
Vamos! Vamos!</i>

01:06:14.840 --> 01:06:16.363
How'’s my little pirate?

01:06:16.537 --> 01:06:18.409
I'’ll take over.
You go ahead
and get cleaned up.

01:06:18.583 --> 01:06:21.107
Hey, hey, what'’s--
- what'’s wrong? What is it?
- Nothing.

01:06:21.281 --> 01:06:22.979
Baby, I think I got
something figured out.

01:06:23.153 --> 01:06:25.503
- I just need a little time.
- You ignored
all the warnings, Paul.

01:06:25.677 --> 01:06:29.289
What? What warnings?
What'’re you talking about?

01:06:29.463 --> 01:06:31.335
I saw your signatures.

01:06:31.509 --> 01:06:32.640
My signatures?

01:06:33.380 --> 01:06:35.208
You'’re gonna deny it now?

01:06:35.382 --> 01:06:37.994
Deny what? Honey,
I don'’t know what
you'’re talking about.

01:06:38.168 --> 01:06:40.039
You could'’ve prevented this
from happening.

01:06:40.213 --> 01:06:42.433
Prevent what?
Honey, I don'’t know what
you'’re talking about.

01:06:42.607 --> 01:06:45.131
I saw your signatures
on the safety report.

01:06:48.004 --> 01:06:49.440
You want to explain?

01:06:51.833 --> 01:06:53.705
Huh?

01:06:53.879 --> 01:06:55.533
- It'’s complicated.
- No, no, no.
Don'’t give me that bullshit.

01:06:55.707 --> 01:06:57.491
It is--Don'’t give me
that bullshit. Don'’t.

01:06:57.665 --> 01:06:59.363
What'’s going on, Mom?

01:07:01.234 --> 01:07:02.583
Listen to me.
Ines, don'’t do this.

01:07:02.757 --> 01:07:04.368
Not right now.[Audrey] Mom?

01:07:04.542 --> 01:07:06.370
Listen to me. We can talk about
it when we get out of here.

01:07:06.544 --> 01:07:08.328
- They should know.
- What? No.

01:07:08.502 --> 01:07:10.069
So they'’ll never do
something like this.

01:07:10.243 --> 01:07:12.550
- Ines, please, baby, please.
- Tell them. Tell them.

01:07:12.724 --> 01:07:16.597
Tell them you'’ve been
signing off on this monstrosity
for all these years.

01:07:16.771 --> 01:07:18.295
-  Dad?
- Haven'’t you?

01:07:18.469 --> 01:07:19.774
Okay, I-I did it.

01:07:19.948 --> 01:07:21.559
I did it. There. Is that
what you want to hear?

01:07:21.733 --> 01:07:23.300
Please, let'’s just not
- talk about this right now.
- Why?

01:07:23.474 --> 01:07:25.519
Because we can talk
- about it later.
- Why?

01:07:25.693 --> 01:07:28.218
- Because it'’s my job.
- No, it'’s not your job!

01:07:28.392 --> 01:07:30.394
It'’s not your job!
It'’s not your job!

01:07:30.568 --> 01:07:33.005
Your job is to shut
places like this down!

01:07:34.267 --> 01:07:36.487
Do you have any idea
what you'’ve done? Huh?

01:07:36.661 --> 01:07:37.836
To us? To...

01:07:39.011 --> 01:07:40.360
Look around you, Paul.

01:07:40.534 --> 01:07:42.884
People are dying
because of this.

01:07:43.059 --> 01:07:44.930
- Dying.
- I had no choice.

01:07:45.104 --> 01:07:46.714
I didn'’t.

01:07:46.888 --> 01:07:49.021
I did it for us.
- I did it for them.
- They lost everything.

01:07:49.195 --> 01:07:51.241
I did it so that we
could have a better life.

01:07:51.415 --> 01:07:54.070
- I had no choice!
- At the cost of
other people'’s lives?

01:07:54.244 --> 01:07:56.811
No, you did have a choice!
You did! You did!

01:07:56.985 --> 01:07:58.726
You...

01:07:58.900 --> 01:08:01.033
You did it for yourself, Paul.

01:08:03.731 --> 01:08:05.690
You are the monster.

01:08:05.864 --> 01:08:07.909
Not that thing out there.

01:08:48.602 --> 01:08:50.343
We'’re not gonna make it,
are we?

01:08:52.128 --> 01:08:53.216
No, señor.

01:08:56.567 --> 01:08:58.525
First time
I inspected Diamante,

01:08:58.699 --> 01:09:00.527
it was my first year
on the job.

01:09:05.141 --> 01:09:06.359
She was beautiful.

01:09:23.463 --> 01:09:26.074
She was beautiful.

01:09:26.988 --> 01:09:28.164
Because she was built

01:09:28.338 --> 01:09:30.514
just outside of
federal jurisdiction,

01:09:30.688 --> 01:09:34.605
and the administration
just rolled back
all those regulations.

01:09:34.779 --> 01:09:36.868
Companies like Nixon Oil...

01:09:39.044 --> 01:09:41.089
they were able to come down
to places like this

01:09:41.264 --> 01:09:43.483
and implement their own
self-inspection procedures.

01:09:47.183 --> 01:09:49.707
In that very first test,
she just...

01:09:51.448 --> 01:09:53.450
she failed miserably.

01:09:54.451 --> 01:09:56.540
I hoped that over time,
I'’d be able to

01:09:58.106 --> 01:09:59.804
help make improvements
to her.

01:10:03.851 --> 01:10:08.334
<i>So, when I got back to shore,
I, uh-- I drafted my report.</i>

01:10:08.508 --> 01:10:12.077
I included
all Diamante'’s hazards or...

01:10:12.991 --> 01:10:14.732
or shortcomings.

01:10:15.820 --> 01:10:16.951
And I turned it in.

01:10:18.562 --> 01:10:20.303
<i>The very next morning,</i>

01:10:20.477 --> 01:10:23.131
<i>they called me into
this very fancy office.</i>

01:10:23.306 --> 01:10:26.439
<i>They asked me
if I liked my new job,</i>

01:10:26.613 --> 01:10:30.138
<i>if my soon-to-be-wife
and I were settling
into the new house.</i>

01:10:31.357 --> 01:10:34.055
And they tossed--
tossed the report back at me.

01:10:35.143 --> 01:10:37.189
Right then and there,
they started

01:10:37.363 --> 01:10:38.669
"suggesting"

01:10:40.366 --> 01:10:42.586
that I overlook some of
the problems with the rig.

01:10:44.065 --> 01:10:45.284
<i>They insinuate...</i>

01:10:47.895 --> 01:10:49.245
that if I don'’t do it,

01:10:50.898 --> 01:10:52.683
they'’ll find somebody
who will.

01:10:55.642 --> 01:10:57.209
I revised my report.

01:10:59.298 --> 01:11:01.996
I signed off on every report
that they gave me.

01:11:03.781 --> 01:11:06.131
This went on and on for years.

01:11:07.654 --> 01:11:12.050
All so some rich oil men up
north could keep raking it in

01:11:12.224 --> 01:11:14.574
while this little village
was laid to waste.

01:11:14.748 --> 01:11:16.228
I mean, I played my part,

01:11:16.402 --> 01:11:18.752
but I had no idea it got
this bad.

01:11:25.542 --> 01:11:27.718
You see that bomb?

01:11:27.892 --> 01:11:30.416
Those charges are
the same ones we used

01:11:30.590 --> 01:11:32.157
for underwater demolition.

01:11:38.772 --> 01:11:42.298
Bastards I worked for are
the same ones trying to kill me.

01:11:44.256 --> 01:11:48.173
I knew who you were
as soon as I heard your name.

01:11:49.609 --> 01:11:51.350
Eh?

01:11:51.524 --> 01:11:54.832
I just didn'’t know
Nixon Oil was trying
to blow your ass up.

01:12:04.363 --> 01:12:05.364
God.

01:12:07.279 --> 01:12:09.325
Oh, it makes perfect sense.

01:12:10.761 --> 01:12:14.155
They'’re my signatures
on the documents.

01:12:14.330 --> 01:12:17.463
They get me out of the picture,
they have the perfect scapegoat.

01:12:19.770 --> 01:12:21.162
<i>Ayayay, guero.</i>

01:12:23.687 --> 01:12:26.559
What makes
a measure of a man
is not his house,

01:12:26.733 --> 01:12:27.734
dinero,

01:12:28.735 --> 01:12:30.520
his clothes.

01:12:30.694 --> 01:12:33.392
It'’s what he does
in times of uncertainty.

01:12:35.176 --> 01:12:37.483
You'’re about to lose
your family.

01:12:37.657 --> 01:12:40.094
And the only question
you gotta ask yourself is,

01:12:40.268 --> 01:12:42.009
how do you make it right?

01:12:42.967 --> 01:12:44.664
The faster you figure
that out...

01:12:46.971 --> 01:12:48.886
the faster
you'’ll know what to do.

01:12:56.415 --> 01:12:58.156
And don'’t worry
about the <i>pinche bomba</i>

01:12:58.330 --> 01:12:59.505
blowing our asses up.

01:13:27.838 --> 01:13:28.882
Hmm.

01:13:30.188 --> 01:13:31.058
You'’re making me nervous.

01:13:31.232 --> 01:13:32.277
Sorry.

01:13:38.544 --> 01:13:41.547
Hey, guys.
What about this?

01:13:41.721 --> 01:13:44.332
No, no, no, no, no.
That raft'’s <i>no bueno.</i>
It has rips.

01:13:47.858 --> 01:13:49.337
Wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, Tommy.

01:13:49.512 --> 01:13:50.556
Help me open it.

01:13:51.818 --> 01:13:53.516
[Chato] Mayday, Mayday, Mayday.

01:13:53.690 --> 01:13:55.953
<i>Somos El Diamante de Nixon Oil.</i>

01:14:02.002 --> 01:14:02.960
Mayday...

01:14:11.229 --> 01:14:12.883
Mayday, Mayd--

01:14:13.057 --> 01:14:14.101
<i>Chingas.</i>

01:14:15.973 --> 01:14:18.628
Okay, uh, Tommy, can you
take this to the back, please?

01:14:21.500 --> 01:14:23.328
Hey, what are you guys
up to?

01:14:23.502 --> 01:14:26.766
Oh, Ma. Grab the acetone
and the life jackets
from the lockers.

01:14:26.940 --> 01:14:27.854
- Please.
- Acetone?

01:14:30.248 --> 01:14:31.249
What are we doing?

01:14:31.423 --> 01:14:33.643
We need patches.
Lots of them.

01:14:33.817 --> 01:14:36.428
- Do we have glue?
- Watch and learn.

01:14:37.734 --> 01:14:39.126
I knew you'’d
come through, girl.

01:14:40.693 --> 01:14:42.913
Here. Uh-huh.
Did you find everything?

01:15:41.972 --> 01:15:43.626
Audrey,
do you have another one?

01:15:43.800 --> 01:15:45.802
- Uh, yeah. How many more?
- Give me one.

01:15:45.976 --> 01:15:48.065
And I want two.

01:15:48.239 --> 01:15:49.893
Guys,
this is really working.

01:15:50.067 --> 01:15:51.068
Yeah.

01:15:54.419 --> 01:15:56.508
Wait, how long have
you been here?

01:15:56.682 --> 01:15:58.684
And you'’re just now trying
to fix the radio?

01:16:01.687 --> 01:16:02.819
Truth is,

01:16:04.516 --> 01:16:07.171
you didn'’t want anyone
to come here, did you?

01:16:08.389 --> 01:16:10.957
You wanted Diamante
to go down the whole time.

01:16:11.131 --> 01:16:12.872
Even if it meant going down
with it.

01:16:15.353 --> 01:16:16.659
To save your people.

01:16:18.486 --> 01:16:19.618
You got a plan, <i>guero?</i>

01:16:20.750 --> 01:16:22.229
Hell, yes, I have a plan.

01:16:23.056 --> 01:16:24.841
I'’m gonna blow that SOB up.

01:16:25.015 --> 01:16:28.279
You can'’t just blow up
that <i>pinche Demonio</i> rig up

01:16:28.453 --> 01:16:30.237
and expect everything
to be okay.

01:16:30.411 --> 01:16:32.805
Of course not.
That'’s why I'’m gonna
seal the leak first.

01:16:32.979 --> 01:16:35.547
Stop the leak?
That'’s impossible.

01:16:35.721 --> 01:16:38.506
Clearly, you don'’t know shit
about repair valves.

01:16:39.333 --> 01:16:40.813
I saw something down there

01:16:40.987 --> 01:16:43.860
that only the guys with
expensive red shirts know.

01:16:45.165 --> 01:16:46.906
You mean burgundy.

01:16:47.080 --> 01:16:49.909
And, in the process,
if I'’m lucky,

01:16:50.083 --> 01:16:52.825
I will appease
an angry rain god.

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:55.741
But how?

01:16:55.915 --> 01:16:59.658
If I can just manually seal
the repair valve
on the drill line.

01:16:59.832 --> 01:17:01.138
It'’s a long shot,

01:17:01.312 --> 01:17:03.053
but hopefully it will
relieve enough pressure

01:17:03.227 --> 01:17:04.663
to trigger
the blowout preventer.

01:17:04.837 --> 01:17:06.186
Therefore...

01:17:06.360 --> 01:17:08.232
Sealing the well....sealing the well. Exactly.

01:17:08.406 --> 01:17:12.236
Seal the well,
I grab the bomb and I feed it
to that son of a bitch.

01:17:13.367 --> 01:17:14.412
And then what?

01:17:16.457 --> 01:17:19.591
Then I-- I get to the bell.

01:17:19.765 --> 01:17:21.854
It should protect me
from the blast.

01:17:22.855 --> 01:17:25.858
- What'’s left of it.
- And then you and I,

01:17:26.032 --> 01:17:29.253
we get us a really good
bottle of tequila
and we get drunk.

01:17:29.427 --> 01:17:30.733
You'’re buying.

01:17:30.907 --> 01:17:32.256
No. No, you'’re not--Chato, listen to me.

01:17:32.430 --> 01:17:34.258
There'’s no other--Do not do this.

01:17:34.432 --> 01:17:37.827
<i>Yo soy jefe.</i>
- You will go down with it.
- Listen to me. Listen to me.

01:17:38.697 --> 01:17:40.133
You'’ve got a big heart.

01:17:40.307 --> 01:17:43.049
But this rig,
this-- this leak,

01:17:43.223 --> 01:17:44.790
it'’s my fault.

01:17:44.964 --> 01:17:46.879
That thing down there,
it wants me.

01:17:47.053 --> 01:17:49.839
You know that.
You of all people know that.

01:17:50.013 --> 01:17:51.841
And this will work.

01:17:52.015 --> 01:17:54.495
As soon as I go down,
you get my family
into that raft...

01:17:54.670 --> 01:17:57.585
...and you get them off this rig
and you get them to safety.

01:17:57.760 --> 01:17:59.239
Take my bag with you.
Okay?

01:18:03.113 --> 01:18:04.462
Hey, Dad.

01:18:04.636 --> 01:18:05.855
Yeah, buddy?

01:18:06.029 --> 01:18:07.421
Does this work?

01:18:11.556 --> 01:18:14.298
Wow. It-- It--
Is it done?

01:18:14.472 --> 01:18:15.386
Yep.

01:18:15.560 --> 01:18:16.692
You okay, Dad?

01:18:16.866 --> 01:18:18.258
Yeah, baby, I'’m okay.

01:18:21.305 --> 01:18:22.306
Hey.

01:18:23.481 --> 01:18:25.439
You guys ready
to get out of here?

01:18:27.746 --> 01:18:31.663
It feels like
maybe we should... pray?

01:18:36.624 --> 01:18:37.625
You know how to pray?

01:18:37.800 --> 01:18:39.671
Wow.

01:18:39.845 --> 01:18:42.718
After all these years
of me trying to make you
believe in something.

01:18:42.892 --> 01:18:45.764
Okay.
You finally made your point.

01:18:45.938 --> 01:18:48.332
You too, Mr. Chato.

01:19:51.047 --> 01:19:52.439
Paul. Wait, no.

01:19:52.613 --> 01:19:54.006
Listen.

01:19:54.180 --> 01:19:57.009
I have made terrible mistakes
and I am so sorry.

01:19:59.882 --> 01:20:01.709
There is a bomb on the rig.

01:20:03.015 --> 01:20:04.364
What?

01:20:04.538 --> 01:20:06.453
I-- I don'’t have time
to explain right now.

01:20:06.627 --> 01:20:08.238
I actually think
it helps us.

01:20:08.412 --> 01:20:10.240
I'’m gonna go down,
I'’m gonna dislodge '’em,

01:20:10.414 --> 01:20:13.460
and then I'’m gonna get up
inside the bell and drop '’em.

01:20:13.634 --> 01:20:14.853
To kill the monster.

01:20:16.507 --> 01:20:18.422
That'’s not the monster, remember?

01:20:32.653 --> 01:20:34.655
Baby, my mind is clear.

01:20:41.271 --> 01:20:42.272
I love you.

01:20:46.885 --> 01:20:49.018
Now, get the kids to safety.
Now. Go.

01:20:56.895 --> 01:20:59.593
We'’re out of tanks
and this one'’s almost empty.

01:21:01.421 --> 01:21:02.509
I'’ll make it work.

01:21:04.076 --> 01:21:06.731
I'’ve been thinkin'’,
and if you don'’t
make it, what then?

01:21:06.905 --> 01:21:08.472
Then look after my family.

01:21:09.299 --> 01:21:10.300
Okay.

01:21:10.996 --> 01:21:12.215
You'’re family too, man.

01:21:13.607 --> 01:21:16.349
Promise me,
whatever happens down there,

01:21:17.568 --> 01:21:20.092
you will get my family
off this rig.

01:21:20.266 --> 01:21:21.398
Deal?

01:21:23.487 --> 01:21:24.923
You got a deal, <i>cabrón.</i>

01:21:25.097 --> 01:21:27.491
If there really is some
pissed-off god out there,

01:21:27.665 --> 01:21:29.667
maybe he'’ll cut us
some slack now.

01:21:29.841 --> 01:21:32.017
Well, the <i>pinche Demonio</i>
won'’t.

01:21:36.848 --> 01:21:37.893
I got no spit.

01:21:44.769 --> 01:21:46.379
See you
on the other side, amigo.

01:21:53.256 --> 01:21:55.432
I love you.

01:22:00.045 --> 01:22:01.612
Love you.

01:22:13.145 --> 01:22:14.233
All right.

01:22:18.934 --> 01:22:19.935
All good.

01:22:21.414 --> 01:22:22.763
See you around.

01:22:47.527 --> 01:22:49.312
Okay, <i>familia.</i>
We gotta go.

01:22:51.270 --> 01:22:53.925
Tommy! Watch your step.

01:22:54.099 --> 01:22:56.667
Okay. Boy,
I'’m checking out for you.

01:24:40.553 --> 01:24:42.599
<i>Vamos. Vamos.</i>[Ines] Okay.

01:24:42.773 --> 01:24:43.730
I'’m ready. <i>Vamos.</i>

01:24:43.904 --> 01:24:45.080
I'’m ready.

01:26:32.099 --> 01:26:35.190

No. What are you
talking about?

01:26:48.812 --> 01:26:50.988
Stick to the plan, Paul.

01:26:51.162 --> 01:26:53.251
<i>I'’m afraid this is the plan.</i>

01:26:55.906 --> 01:26:57.429
<i>Honey,</i>

01:26:57.603 --> 01:27:01.651
tell Chato, his town,
his people, that I'’m sorry.

01:27:01.825 --> 01:27:03.566
And things are gonna
get better soon.

01:27:03.740 --> 01:27:07.265

You had it in you all along.
Remember that.

01:27:36.903 --> 01:27:38.035

01:27:48.872 --> 01:27:51.266
<i>I'’m not sailing
where you guys are.</i>

01:27:53.006 --> 01:27:57.141

the world with their crew.

01:28:12.461 --> 01:28:16.073
<i>Buddy, you'’re the captain now.
You understand what I'’m saying?</i>

01:28:18.118 --> 01:28:19.163
I think so.

01:28:22.514 --> 01:28:24.429
