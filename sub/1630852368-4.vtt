-<i>Get goin', go on</i> -<i>Get goin', go on</i>

00:13.680 --> 00:15.891
-<i>Take friends along</i> -<i>Take friends along</i>

00:15.974 --> 00:18.143
-<i>Go do it all</i> -<i>Go do it all</i>

00:18.227 --> 00:20.103
<i>We all just gotta unplug</i>

00:20.187 --> 00:22.564
<i>Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey</i>

00:22.648 --> 00:24.942
<i>Just like the way Doug unplugs</i>

00:35.536 --> 00:36.954
You two like our song?

00:37.037 --> 00:40.541
Like it? We tra-la-la-love it!

00:40.624 --> 00:42.042
Princess Woofingham does too.

00:46.004 --> 00:50.634
-What do you call your song, Mom? -I call it "Mom Song"!

00:50.717 --> 00:52.135
Classic.

00:52.219 --> 00:53.762
Optimal title, Mrs. Pine.

00:53.846 --> 00:56.306
I can't believe our band, The Funky Freckles,

00:56.390 --> 00:58.183
is playing in the park tonight.

00:58.267 --> 01:00.727
You even made the poster.

01:03.313 --> 01:05.691
A text from our babysitter. She can't stay!

01:06.525 --> 01:07.776
Good one.

01:07.860 --> 01:10.988
No, it's no joke, Esmerelda. She really can't stay.

01:11.655 --> 01:14.366
We're gonna have to head home to take care of the kids.

01:16.994 --> 01:20.330
So sorry we won't be able to play the concert tonight, Monica.

01:20.414 --> 01:21.748
I understand.

01:21.832 --> 01:25.210
Well, we'll be extra ready for the next concert.

01:28.797 --> 01:30.048
Oh, no.

01:30.132 --> 01:33.177
Mom, does that mean you won't be able to play your song tonight?

01:33.260 --> 01:35.846
Well, I can't perform it alone, Emma.

01:35.929 --> 01:39.641
I need the other instruments to play along, or it won't sound right.

01:40.893 --> 01:43.520
I guess the Freckles won't be getting funky tonight.

01:45.606 --> 01:48.567
Poor Mom. She was so excited,

01:48.650 --> 01:51.612
and now, she doesn't have anyone to play her song with her.

01:52.321 --> 01:54.489
Wait a syncopated second.

01:54.573 --> 01:57.910
If she doesn't have anyone to play her song with her tonight,

01:57.993 --> 02:00.579
maybe we can be her band.

02:00.662 --> 02:04.249
What do you say, Doug? Are you feeling funky?

02:04.333 --> 02:08.002
Affirmative, but what's a band, Emma?

02:08.086 --> 02:10.214
Better plug in to find out.

02:12.257 --> 02:14.218
<i>Hear that? It's the sound of a drum</i>

02:14.301 --> 02:16.762
<i>An instrument that keeps the rhythm</i>

02:16.845 --> 02:18.764
<i>Add a little bass Like boom, boom, boom</i>

02:18.847 --> 02:21.266
<i>To complete the beat Now we've got a groove</i>

02:21.350 --> 02:25.938
<i>In come the keys Playing a melody</i>

02:26.021 --> 02:29.399
<i>A guitar, strumming chords For harmony</i>

02:30.067 --> 02:33.904
<i>There's a singer singing lyrics To be clear, that's me</i>

02:33.987 --> 02:39.409
<i>We sound better together When we rock out as a band</i>

02:39.493 --> 02:42.996
<i>All our parts create a song Together we can</i>

02:43.080 --> 02:47.835
<i>Sound better together With our instruments in hand</i>

02:47.918 --> 02:49.837
Keytar!

02:52.005 --> 02:54.424
<i>Together we're a band</i>

02:55.133 --> 02:56.677
Now I know what a band is.

02:56.760 --> 02:59.346
It's a group of humans that play songs together.

02:59.429 --> 03:01.348
But I still have a big question.

03:01.431 --> 03:04.017
How can we help your mom play her song?

03:04.101 --> 03:08.480
Well, my bot-tastic buddy, if we're gonna be a band and play a song,

03:08.564 --> 03:12.150
the first thing we need are instruments.

03:12.234 --> 03:14.945
But where can we find some?

03:16.321 --> 03:17.447
What about Rebots?

03:17.531 --> 03:19.700
We reboot all sorts of things there.

03:20.993 --> 03:23.036
Wow! You bots are busy.

03:23.120 --> 03:24.997
There must be an instrument here.

03:25.080 --> 03:27.374
Hey, let's ask your mom.

03:30.085 --> 03:32.337
Hello, my bot. Hi, Emma.

03:32.421 --> 03:36.466
My apologies for the noise.

03:36.550 --> 03:38.552
Peter Bot here has a broken wheel.

03:38.635 --> 03:40.762
Hopefully, I'll be wheeling better soon.

03:40.846 --> 03:44.224
Mom, we were wondering if you've seen any instruments around Rebots.

03:44.308 --> 03:47.060
We wanna help Emma's mom play at the concert tonight.

03:48.145 --> 03:51.857
I don't seem to have the term "instruments" in my memory drive.

03:51.940 --> 03:53.483
Can you update me about it?

03:53.567 --> 03:58.197
An instrument is something that makes beautiful music. Like this.

04:04.536 --> 04:07.039
Now I process what instruments are.

04:07.122 --> 04:09.958
Yes. You displayed maximum sound efficiency.

04:10.042 --> 04:15.172
Now, if only I, Peter Bot, had maximum wheel efficiency.

04:15.255 --> 04:16.548
But I'm sorry.

04:16.632 --> 04:20.135
I haven't heard anything like that around this part of Rebots.

04:20.219 --> 04:22.221
Maybe you should check the warehouse.

04:22.846 --> 04:24.097
Good idea!

04:24.181 --> 04:26.016
You can find anything in there.

04:28.393 --> 04:30.604
Nope. Nope. Nope.

04:30.687 --> 04:33.524
Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope.

04:33.607 --> 04:35.567
No instruments down here.

04:35.651 --> 04:36.693
Or here.

04:36.777 --> 04:37.819
Or upside down.

04:38.487 --> 04:39.738
Keep looking, Doug.

04:39.821 --> 04:42.908
We've gotta find something to help Mom play her song tonight.

04:46.703 --> 04:49.665
Listen, Emma. Is that the sound of an instrument?

04:49.748 --> 04:53.877
Well, there's only one way to find out. Follow that beat.

04:59.216 --> 05:03.303
-The sound's coming from Uncle Forkrick. -Greetings, young processors.

05:03.387 --> 05:05.180
-Hi, Uncle Forkrick. -Hey there.

05:05.264 --> 05:08.141
You know everything in this warehouse, right, Uncle Forkrick?

05:08.225 --> 05:10.269
Like the back of my forks.

05:10.352 --> 05:13.730
Have you seen any instruments in here? They sound like this.

05:13.814 --> 05:15.691
A one, two, three. Hit it.

05:22.072 --> 05:23.323
Wait a nanosecond.

05:23.407 --> 05:25.909
I did hear something that sounds like that.

05:25.993 --> 05:28.871
It was, well, right over there.

05:32.291 --> 05:35.210
Must be an English-to-elephant translator machine,

05:35.294 --> 05:38.630
but there's no elephants here, so I guess I'll reboot it.

05:40.215 --> 05:42.050
Doug! That was an instrument.

05:42.134 --> 05:44.553
We gotta get to Jenny before she reboots it.

05:44.636 --> 05:46.096
Follow that tuba.

05:47.681 --> 05:49.766
Jenny! Stop!

05:49.850 --> 05:51.560
Uh-oh, she can't hear us.

05:53.395 --> 05:55.564
Doug, you've gotta stop her.

05:55.647 --> 05:58.609
Don't worry, Emma. I got this.

06:01.403 --> 06:03.697
Jenny, no!

06:03.780 --> 06:05.199
And there.

06:05.282 --> 06:08.994
Now that elephant translator can be rebooted into something new.

06:09.912 --> 06:11.580
Great gigabytes!

06:12.497 --> 06:15.459
Emma, the tuba's heading for a reboot booth.

06:15.542 --> 06:17.336
Let's find the right one.

06:20.339 --> 06:22.341
It's headed for the blue tube.

06:24.718 --> 06:27.221
Wait. No, the green one.

06:29.973 --> 06:31.934
Sensors indicate yellow.

06:33.185 --> 06:35.896
It's going for orange. It's…

06:36.772 --> 06:40.317
I know. You take the booth on one side, Doug. I'll take the other side.

06:40.400 --> 06:41.401
Great idea, Emma.

06:41.485 --> 06:44.655
That way, we can save the tuba wherever it goes.

06:49.243 --> 06:53.872
Okay, looks like it's going to…

06:53.956 --> 06:55.916
-…the middle! -The middle booth!

06:59.127 --> 07:00.754
And I'll just click this.

07:00.838 --> 07:02.339
-Wait! -No!

07:10.806 --> 07:14.643
Uh-oh, Emma. I don't think this works anymore.

07:14.726 --> 07:18.230
Oh, no. We can't play a watering can.

07:18.313 --> 07:20.524
We're "tuba" late.

07:20.607 --> 07:24.278
Watering can delivery. Droneberg on it!

07:26.321 --> 07:28.282
So much for helping Mom.

07:28.365 --> 07:33.036
The concert is starting soon, and we didn't find a single instrument.

07:34.663 --> 07:37.207
Crash alert, crash alert. Not safe, not safe.

07:37.291 --> 07:39.459
Wait. Emma, do you hear that?

07:39.543 --> 07:43.463
Safety Bot's beeping fits in with your mom's song very effectively.

07:50.846 --> 07:53.307
You're right. It's got rhythm.

07:53.390 --> 07:55.934
Just like Esmerelda's drum.

08:00.397 --> 08:02.566
Come to process it,

08:02.649 --> 08:07.154
the squeaky wheel my mom was working on would fit into the song too.

08:10.616 --> 08:14.745
And the rhythmic noises Mr. Forkrick makes when he stacks boxes

08:14.828 --> 08:16.538
would also sound great.

08:18.040 --> 08:19.291
And Jenny.

08:19.374 --> 08:22.836
That whirring noise she makes almost matches my memory bank files

08:22.920 --> 08:24.630
of Esmerelda's harmonica.

08:24.713 --> 08:26.507
It could also upgrade our sound.

08:26.590 --> 08:29.676
Come on, Doug. Let's put these sounds together.

08:43.023 --> 08:45.651
Bravo, bots. Bravo.

08:45.734 --> 08:48.362
It's really starting to sound like Mom's song.

08:48.445 --> 08:52.407
And, hey, we didn't need instruments to play it after all.

08:53.116 --> 08:56.578
Emma, I just realized the answer to my big question.

08:56.662 --> 09:00.207
To help your mom play her song, we can use the sounds we hear around us.

09:00.290 --> 09:04.294
Here I came in for a tune-up, and now I'm playing a tune.

09:04.378 --> 09:06.964
It's a great day for Peter Bot.

09:07.047 --> 09:11.009
Or the band can bippity bot bop to these fresh beeps.

09:11.093 --> 09:12.344
Right, Safety Bot?

09:12.427 --> 09:14.221
Wait, what's happening?

09:14.304 --> 09:16.139
Get ready to boogie, bots.

09:16.223 --> 09:19.059
Mega City concert, here we come.

09:20.894 --> 09:23.438
<i>And now, without further ado,</i>

09:23.522 --> 09:27.234
<i>I present to you all our next band of the evening,</i>

09:27.317 --> 09:30.070
<i>The Funky Freckles!</i>

09:30.863 --> 09:32.364
The Funky Freckles?

09:32.447 --> 09:35.200
<i>Featuring The Band of Bots.</i>

09:35.284 --> 09:37.035
This one's for you, Mom.

09:37.870 --> 09:39.204
One, two, three!

09:46.003 --> 09:48.338
Your sound bites are great, Uncle Forkrick.

09:57.848 --> 10:00.517
And some beats from my best buddy bot.

10:03.312 --> 10:04.438
Come on up, Mom.

10:07.983 --> 10:08.984
Take it away.

10:34.885 --> 10:36.136
We did it, Doug.

10:36.220 --> 10:39.264
We found new sounds so Mom can perform her song.

10:39.848 --> 10:41.099
I have an idea, Emma.

10:41.183 --> 10:44.394
If we used the sounds the bots made to play your mom's song,

10:44.478 --> 10:48.023
maybe we can ask the audience to make sounds and join us too.

10:48.774 --> 10:52.903
Everyone, please join us for an encore of my mom's song

10:52.986 --> 10:56.073
using, well, whatever you've got.

10:56.156 --> 10:58.825
Come on, Mega City. Follow the beat.

11:04.498 --> 11:05.832
This is amazing!

11:05.916 --> 11:08.502
I'm so happy I got to play my song tonight.

11:08.585 --> 11:11.797
And it's all thanks to you two.

11:16.051 --> 11:17.302
Take it away, Mom.

11:51.211 --> 11:52.921
What are you doing, Emma?

11:53.005 --> 11:56.925
Welcome, Doug, to the wonderful world of…

11:57.009 --> 12:00.470
Hold on. The wonderful world of…

12:01.597 --> 12:02.598
magic!

12:08.020 --> 12:10.606
I've been practicing my magician skills.

12:10.689 --> 12:14.109
Magician? I'm not quite sure what a magician is.

12:14.193 --> 12:16.820
I'll plug in and find out what it means.

12:20.949 --> 12:24.494
<i>Hey Do you wanna see a trick today?</i>

12:24.578 --> 12:28.874
<i>I wave my magic stick and say Abracadabra alakazam</i>

12:28.957 --> 12:31.460
<i>The magic words of magicians</i>

12:31.543 --> 12:33.295
<i>And I can make a pencil levitate</i>

12:33.378 --> 12:36.006
<i>Amaze you with a great escape and wait</i>

12:36.089 --> 12:38.091
<i>Pop a rabbit out of a hat</i>

12:38.175 --> 12:41.303
<i>Make a coin disappear Then bring it right back</i>

12:41.386 --> 12:46.725
<i>They call me a magician by definition 'Cause I do magic tricks for a living</i>

12:46.808 --> 12:51.855
<i>Singing abracadabra alakazam These are the tricks of magicians</i>

12:51.939 --> 12:56.735
<i>I'm a magician by definition 'Cause I do magic tricks for a living</i>

12:56.818 --> 12:59.446
<i>With a twirl and a shake I can make things move</i>

12:59.530 --> 13:03.325
<i>Hope my magic tricks have amazed you</i>

13:04.826 --> 13:06.119
I get it.

13:06.203 --> 13:09.164
A magician is someone who entertains an audience

13:09.248 --> 13:11.542
by performing amazing magic tricks.

13:11.625 --> 13:14.419
But I still have one big question.

13:14.503 --> 13:17.089
What makes a magic trick amazing?

13:17.172 --> 13:19.591
I thought you'd never ask.

13:21.385 --> 13:25.556
I present to you the disappearing coin trick.

13:27.850 --> 13:33.146
Now, I will close my eyes and let the magic take hold.

13:33.230 --> 13:34.565
Wait for it.

13:35.858 --> 13:37.943
Abracadabra!

13:40.028 --> 13:43.699
Great gears, Emma. How did you make that coin disappear?

13:43.782 --> 13:46.285
A magician never tells.

13:46.368 --> 13:51.248
And what is this I see? Something shiny. Could it be…

13:52.624 --> 13:54.418
Ta-da!

13:55.752 --> 13:57.337
Where did that coin come from?

13:57.421 --> 13:59.756
It's… magic!

14:02.050 --> 14:03.760
Enchanting Emma speaking.

14:03.844 --> 14:05.262
Dad.

14:05.345 --> 14:08.265
Oops. Sorry, Dad. Be right there.

14:08.974 --> 14:12.853
Guess I was supposed to clean up my room before I came over.

14:12.936 --> 14:14.021
Bye, Doug.

14:14.104 --> 14:17.858
Time to disappear from Rebots and head on home.

14:17.941 --> 14:20.527
Princess Woofingham, say goodbye to Critter Bot.

14:29.536 --> 14:32.497
Uh-oh. The Enchanting Emma left her wand here.

14:34.541 --> 14:37.920
Maybe if I figure out how Emma made this coin disappear,

14:38.003 --> 14:40.339
I'll find out what makes a magic trick amazing.

14:42.007 --> 14:43.133
Let's see.

14:43.926 --> 14:45.469
She held the coin like this.

14:45.552 --> 14:48.722
Then she closed her eyes,

14:48.805 --> 14:51.391
waved her magic wand back and forth,

14:51.475 --> 14:55.229
back and forth, and wait for it…

14:55.312 --> 14:59.274
Abracadabra!

15:01.777 --> 15:06.448
It didn't work. Guess I'm not very good at magic tricks, right, Critter Bot?

15:07.324 --> 15:08.575
Critter Bot?

15:08.659 --> 15:11.203
Where'd you disappear off to, little botty?

15:14.665 --> 15:15.707
Oh, no.

15:15.791 --> 15:18.377
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

15:18.460 --> 15:21.213
I think I made Critter Bot disappear!

15:23.257 --> 15:24.633
Where could he be?

15:24.716 --> 15:25.717
Critter Bot.

15:26.969 --> 15:27.970
Critter Bot!

15:28.679 --> 15:29.680
Critter Bot!

15:32.683 --> 15:34.017
Critter Bot?

15:39.898 --> 15:43.902
Nephew bot, didn't scan you there. What you doing in that box?

15:44.486 --> 15:48.198
Looking for Critter Bot. I did a magic trick and he disappeared.

15:48.282 --> 15:51.577
Disappeared? You mean Critter Bot is gone?

15:51.660 --> 15:52.953
I think so.

15:53.036 --> 15:55.956
Now, now. Let's not get our gears in a grind.

15:56.039 --> 16:01.128
Seems to me if this thing you call a magic trick made the fella disappear,

16:01.211 --> 16:04.047
then a magic trick can make him reappear too.

16:04.131 --> 16:06.925
But, Uncle Forkrick, how do I do that?

16:07.009 --> 16:08.844
I'm a robot, not a magician.

16:08.927 --> 16:13.182
Then I suppose we'll just have to reboot you into one.

16:13.765 --> 16:14.766
That's it.

16:14.850 --> 16:18.437
If I become a magician and find out what makes magic tricks amazing…

16:18.520 --> 16:21.398
Then you can do an amazing magic trick.

16:21.481 --> 16:23.442
And bring Critter Bot back.

16:23.984 --> 16:27.863
If you wanna be a magician, first you have to look like one.

16:31.867 --> 16:34.494
Then I have to learn lots of magic tricks.

16:34.578 --> 16:36.747
Initiate magic trick download.

16:37.456 --> 16:40.417
I sure hope one of these helps us find Critter Bot.

16:43.212 --> 16:45.589
Thank you, Princess Woofingham.

16:45.672 --> 16:47.216
Thank you, Princess Woofingham.

16:48.050 --> 16:50.093
Thank you, Princess Woofingham.

16:50.177 --> 16:52.179
Thank you, Princess Woofingham.

16:52.262 --> 16:53.889
Thank you, Critter Bot.

16:53.972 --> 16:56.099
Hold up! Critter Bot?

16:57.226 --> 16:58.769
Hey, little bot.

16:58.852 --> 17:00.729
You're not supposed to be here.

17:04.441 --> 17:08.069
Well, I know you and Princess Woofingham are best buds,

17:08.153 --> 17:11.281
but we gotta get you back home to Rebots.

17:12.449 --> 17:14.117
Doug might be worried about you.

17:17.954 --> 17:20.290
Magic trick download complete.

17:20.374 --> 17:23.794
Now you look like a magician, and you know magic tricks,

17:23.877 --> 17:26.213
so let's bring Critter Bot back.

17:26.296 --> 17:33.136
I, The Bot-tastic Doug, will now make Critter Bot reappear.

17:33.220 --> 17:34.721
I hope.

17:34.805 --> 17:39.142
And abracadabra!

17:40.269 --> 17:41.937
I think I hear Critter Bot.

17:42.020 --> 17:43.188
So do I.

17:43.272 --> 17:44.857
Critter Bot!

17:44.940 --> 17:46.441
He's right over he--

17:46.525 --> 17:48.569
Safety Bot, is Critter Bot with you?

17:48.652 --> 17:50.237
There's no Critter Bot here, Doug.

17:50.320 --> 17:53.866
That beeping you heard is my new danger detector,

17:53.949 --> 17:55.325
which you just set off.

17:56.577 --> 17:59.746
As a reminder, Rebots rule number 346-Q

17:59.830 --> 18:03.750
clearly states that running indoors wearing a top hat is dangerous.

18:04.376 --> 18:05.377
Safety first.

18:06.753 --> 18:10.215
I don't get it. Why can't I make Critter Bot reappear?

18:10.299 --> 18:14.970
I look like a magician, and I've downloaded lots of magic tricks.

18:15.053 --> 18:16.763
Is there something we're missing?

18:17.848 --> 18:19.766
Wait a nanosecond.

18:21.059 --> 18:23.437
There. That's what we're missing.

18:23.520 --> 18:24.813
-It is? -Yeah.

18:24.897 --> 18:27.482
Magicians don't just do magic tricks.

18:27.566 --> 18:30.027
They put on a magic show for an audience.

18:30.110 --> 18:31.987
Way to replug, Doug.

18:32.070 --> 18:34.406
Bots, drones, I need your help.

18:34.489 --> 18:37.743
It's time to deliver some robo-magic.

18:39.536 --> 18:43.040
Magic show. Magic show today in Mega City park.

18:43.123 --> 18:46.877
Come one, come all. See the amazing Bot-tastic Doug.

18:50.088 --> 18:52.257
Gather around, humans and bots.

18:52.341 --> 18:54.176
It's magic show time.

18:55.093 --> 18:56.553
Wait, what's magic? Is it safe?

18:56.637 --> 18:59.598
Prepare to be amazed.

18:59.681 --> 19:01.308
Charge up your magic, Doug.

19:01.391 --> 19:04.853
You've got yourself an audience, and they're ready for a show.

19:04.937 --> 19:07.397
I hope this brings back Critter Bot.

19:08.148 --> 19:12.778
Wait, wait. Rebots is that way.

19:12.861 --> 19:17.783
Welcome, everyone, to the mysterious magic of The Bot-tastic Doug.

19:21.119 --> 19:23.163
Thank you all for coming.

19:23.247 --> 19:27.334
For my first trick, I, The Bot-tastic Doug,

19:27.417 --> 19:32.297
will perform the mysterious floating robot.

19:37.344 --> 19:38.929
Wow. Amazing!

19:40.681 --> 19:44.726
For my next trick, I will need a volunteer from the audience.

19:44.810 --> 19:45.978
Me! Me! Me!

19:46.061 --> 19:48.897
You there, fine bot. Come on up.

19:50.065 --> 19:52.568
Okay. Pick a cog. Any cog.

19:53.151 --> 19:56.947
Beep, boop, boop. Cog processed.

19:57.030 --> 19:58.740
Good. Now…

20:00.117 --> 20:02.327
Is this your cog?

20:04.162 --> 20:08.625
Beep beep. Cog matching status 100%.

20:08.709 --> 20:11.044
And for his final trick,

20:11.128 --> 20:17.342
The Bot-tastic Doug will make his robo-pet, Critter Bot, reappear.

20:17.426 --> 20:20.053
-No way. -Wow, amazing!

20:20.137 --> 20:21.763
I hope this works.

20:24.016 --> 20:26.185
Come on, you crazy critters.

20:48.332 --> 20:50.584
Why are you pets so playful?

20:51.210 --> 20:54.087
And now, Critter Bot will reappear.

20:56.173 --> 20:58.258
Abracadabra!

21:01.261 --> 21:03.305
Critter Bot, it worked!

21:04.014 --> 21:05.098
My magic worked.

21:05.182 --> 21:07.768
We did it, Doug. What a show!

21:11.855 --> 21:14.066
I missed you so much, little bot.

21:18.445 --> 21:19.446
Emma?

21:20.239 --> 21:23.867
Emma, did I make you and Princess Woofingham appear too?

21:23.951 --> 21:26.453
Actually, Doug, Critter Bot followed us home.

21:29.164 --> 21:33.377
And you did an amazing magic trick.

21:33.460 --> 21:34.711
I did?

21:35.587 --> 21:36.880
I did.

21:36.964 --> 21:38.715
It was incredible.

21:38.799 --> 21:42.219
And I finally learned what makes magic tricks amazing.

21:42.302 --> 21:44.721
They're mysterious and surprising.

21:44.805 --> 21:46.640
You said it, ro-buddy.

21:47.224 --> 21:49.518
And I know who'd love to see a trick.

21:50.727 --> 21:57.568
Cog. Cog. Cog. Cog. Cog. Cog. Cog.

21:57.651 --> 22:01.405
Hey, Dad. Think you can guess which item will be rebooted next?

22:01.488 --> 22:03.115
Hello, my bot.

22:03.198 --> 22:06.785
Well, I guess since I've been rebooting nothing but cogs

22:06.869 --> 22:09.830
for the past 59 hours,

22:09.913 --> 22:13.584
the next item to be rebooted will be… a cog.

22:13.667 --> 22:16.879
Well, Dad, prepare to be amazed.

22:16.962 --> 22:19.131
Abracadabra!

22:20.841 --> 22:22.217
Critter Bot.

22:23.010 --> 22:26.180
Well, bust my buttons, that's amazing.

22:26.263 --> 22:27.639
How'd you do it, kids?

22:27.723 --> 22:29.933
A magician never tells.

22:32.936 --> 22:35.272
But you're gonna tell me, right?

22:35.355 --> 22:38.192
<i>They call me a magician By definition</i>

22:38.275 --> 22:41.069
<i>'Cause I do magic tricks for a living</i>

22:45.949 --> 22:50.662
<i>I'm a magician by definition 'Cause I do magic tricks for a living</i>

22:55.834 --> 22:58.337
<i>With a twirl and a shake I can make things move</i>

22:58.420 --> 23:01.757
<i>Hope my magic tricks have amazed you</i>
