00:02.280 --> 00:05.400
This programme contains some scenes
which some viewers may find
upsetting,

00:05.400 --> 00:07.320
strong language and
discriminatory language

00:07.320 --> 00:09.600
Anyway, there's this fourth-year kid
and he's won a football,

00:09.600 --> 00:12.080
a box of chocolates and a bottle
of wine, and I'm like, "Bloody hell,

00:12.080 --> 00:14.000
"I'm going to get this lad
to do me lottery numbers."

00:14.000 --> 00:15.920
And then he comes up again,
another winning ticket,

00:15.920 --> 00:17.800
and this time
it's a 20-year-old scotch.

00:17.800 --> 00:20.280
So, I'm like,
"Right, OK, something's up."

00:20.280 --> 00:22.920
So I go, "All right, lad,
empty your pockets."

00:22.920 --> 00:25.440
And he's only gone and got
a matching book of tickets.

00:25.440 --> 00:27.480
He got it online,
the enterprising little sod.

00:27.480 --> 00:29.040
No, no, but that's not
the worst bit.

00:29.040 --> 00:31.200
I'm stood there wondering
what to do, right,

00:31.200 --> 00:33.400
and then he says,
"I'm going to cut you a deal,

00:33.400 --> 00:35.960
"You keep your mouth shut for the
box of chocs."  What did you do?

00:35.960 --> 00:38.640
The cheeky little bastard. I said,
"You can't buy me off with a box

00:38.640 --> 00:40.480
"of pralines, give me the scotch!"

00:40.480 --> 00:42.000
THEY LAUGH

00:42.000 --> 00:43.760
PHONE VIBRATES

00:49.120 --> 00:52.080
I've got to go.  No. You're not
leaving me with all the surgeons.

00:52.080 --> 00:53.960
Come on.
They're loving the big builder.

00:53.960 --> 00:56.000
Just tell 'em they can have a go
driving the van.

00:56.000 --> 00:58.320
I'm sure I won't be long.
What does he want this time?

01:00.120 --> 01:02.200
I'm so sorry, everyone,
something's come up.

01:02.200 --> 01:05.080
But this has been so lovely,
we'll do it again soon.

01:05.080 --> 01:06.920
Julia, you sign me up for the fete,

01:06.920 --> 01:08.920
but probably not
the tombola this time.

01:08.920 --> 01:13.080
I am leaving my better half
with you, so please be gentle.

01:14.720 --> 01:16.760
Bye, everyone. ALL:  Bye!

01:20.840 --> 01:23.520

OUTGOING DIALLING TONE

01:38.360 --> 01:40.000
What is it?

01:47.240 --> 01:49.640
Yeah, I know the one. How long ago?

01:49.640 --> 01:51.400
And there's no-one else who c...

01:55.520 --> 01:57.640
I hope he knows what he's asking.

06:05.720 --> 06:07.920
You all right?
Fine. All done.

06:09.240 --> 06:11.640
You still there?
I reckon I can make last orders.

06:11.640 --> 06:13.920
No, I'm home. Took a taxi.

06:13.920 --> 06:16.480
I knew you'd bail, you big loser.

06:18.960 --> 06:20.800
Don't wait up! I love ya.

SIREN WAILS

06:49.800 --> 06:52.760
Why don't you try catching some real
criminals for a change?

06:52.760 --> 06:54.640
Ma'am, I'm so sorry.

06:56.160 --> 06:58.920
That's why I recognised your car.
Nah, you're all right.

06:58.920 --> 07:00.600
What's going on, was I weaving?

07:00.600 --> 07:02.400
We're pulling over everything,

07:02.400 --> 07:05.480
a body's just been found at an old
boozer up the road in Bramley.

07:05.480 --> 07:06.800
Shot, looks like.

07:06.800 --> 07:08.360
Drug paraphernalia?

07:08.360 --> 07:10.320
One for us, then.

07:10.320 --> 07:12.400
Well, Phil Cowper's on tonight,

07:12.400 --> 07:15.000
so just poke him with a stick
if you have to.

07:15.000 --> 07:16.600
Now...

07:16.600 --> 07:18.640
..do you want to breathalyse me?

07:18.640 --> 07:20.120
No.

07:20.120 --> 07:21.920

08:34.400 --> 08:36.560
You still up?
It's half past midnight.

08:36.560 --> 08:40.000
No, I'm asleep in bed,
this is astral projection.

08:40.000 --> 08:43.480
Dad said you got called away.
Left him with all the drunk mums.

08:43.480 --> 08:44.680
Yeah. Just work shite.

08:44.680 --> 08:47.680
Oh, your dad were dead awkward,
though, you should've seen it.

08:47.680 --> 08:49.400
You know when his head goes all red?

08:49.400 --> 08:50.880
Oh...

08:50.880 --> 08:52.880
You still feeling peaky, I take it?

08:52.880 --> 08:56.000
Yeah. Slept too long earlier.

08:56.000 --> 08:58.120
You do feel warm.

08:58.120 --> 09:00.080
Keep popping the paracetamol.

09:00.080 --> 09:01.520

09:04.360 --> 09:06.360
Who's this fella, then?

09:06.360 --> 09:08.000
Don't know yet.

09:08.000 --> 09:11.440
Can't get his claw quite right,
though.

09:11.440 --> 09:13.200
You'll crack it.

09:13.200 --> 09:16.760
Crack it! You having that?
Come on, cos it's a crab.

09:16.760 --> 09:19.080
Come on,
laughter's the best medicine.

09:19.080 --> 09:22.080
Oh, I think I just felt this virus
turn into terminal cancer.

09:22.080 --> 09:23.600
Oh, well.

09:23.600 --> 09:25.400
Don't stay up too late.

10:01.680 --> 10:03.960
You all good?
Yeah.

10:03.960 --> 10:07.040
How long did you stay
with your fan club?

10:07.040 --> 10:09.000
About an hour.

10:09.000 --> 10:10.840
I let them hold my big drill.

10:13.280 --> 10:15.960
What did he need you for?
Just a bit of paperwork.

10:19.760 --> 10:21.360
We should get some sleep.

10:21.360 --> 10:23.240
We're out again tomorrow night.

10:23.240 --> 10:26.200
Two nights on the spin at our age -
get us.

11:51.600 --> 11:53.560
Who do you think he's texting?

11:53.560 --> 11:55.600
Oh, God knows.

11:55.600 --> 11:57.960
Who cares? He's happy.
That's all that matters.

11:59.200 --> 12:01.680
Oh, you are bordering on gamey,
my friend.

12:01.680 --> 12:03.440
We've got to go in half an hour.

12:05.760 --> 12:07.920
Oh, God. OK, here it comes.

12:07.920 --> 12:09.440
He's still got a temperature.

12:09.440 --> 12:13.040
Maybe it's best I skip tonight.
Keep an eye on him.

12:13.040 --> 12:15.520
It's a virus, Ceri.
I know you don't want to come,

12:15.520 --> 12:18.600
but don't try and weasel
out of it by using our son.

12:18.600 --> 12:21.080
He's gone to a lot of effort,
he's expecting us.

12:21.080 --> 12:22.800
Don't you want to see the house?

12:24.080 --> 12:25.600
I've seen it.

12:25.600 --> 12:28.000
Couple of years ago.
It's changed a lot.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.880
Well, I didn't like it then either.

12:30.880 --> 12:33.760
After everything he's done for us,
you can't do one evening?

12:33.760 --> 12:36.600
And what about everything you've
done for him?  Keep your voice down.

12:38.720 --> 12:41.400
What was last night all about?

12:41.400 --> 12:42.600
Paperwork? Bollocks.

12:44.080 --> 12:46.720
Oh, now you want to know details?
You never did before!

12:46.720 --> 12:49.040
Well, he never used to call you
out at night, Lou.

12:49.040 --> 12:52.080
Something's changed over the last
year. You've been doing more.

12:53.960 --> 12:56.240
I just wish things
were different, that's all.

12:56.240 --> 12:58.680
Oh, different? Different how?

12:58.680 --> 13:00.640
Do you wish we'd gone bankrupt?

13:00.640 --> 13:04.160
Do you wish we were still in that
basement flat in Chapeltown,

13:04.160 --> 13:06.400
with neighbours chucking pit bull
shit over the fence?

13:06.400 --> 13:09.040
Do you wish Owen was still in the
old school, with those bastards

13:09.040 --> 13:11.960
gobbing down the back of his neck
every morning? Calling him a faggot.

13:11.960 --> 13:14.360
Assuming that you don't,
my advice to you would be to show

13:14.360 --> 13:15.880
a little bit of appreciation

13:15.880 --> 13:18.440
and then you can go right back to
sticking your head in the sand.

13:20.680 --> 13:22.160
OK, fine.

13:22.160 --> 13:25.840
Don't come.
Don't go.  I have to, and I want to.

13:25.840 --> 13:27.360
Don't wait up.

13:45.760 --> 13:47.320
Right, Sick-note. I'm off.

13:47.320 --> 13:49.720
Argh. It's off for a reason.

13:52.280 --> 13:56.160
Won't be long now, Mother. We should
reconcile before my passing.

13:56.160 --> 13:58.480
Yeah, yeah, your dad's bottled it.

13:58.480 --> 14:01.160
He can't go out more than
twice in a week it seems.

14:01.160 --> 14:03.240
So, take another two ibuprofen.

14:03.240 --> 14:05.760
It's just a dinner party thing
so I won't be back late.

14:05.760 --> 14:08.040
Say "hi" to the other middle-aged
swingers for me.

14:08.040 --> 14:10.160
Oh, we don't talk. We just...

14:10.160 --> 14:13.000
SLAPS HAND Urgh, you're disgusting.

14:13.000 --> 14:15.040
Night, sweetheart.

14:17.600 --> 14:20.040
DOOR OPENS AND SHUTS

14:46.960 --> 14:49.600
Evening, Bulge.
Just you?  Just me.

14:51.040 --> 14:53.320
How you doing, Slack?
You all right, darling?

14:53.320 --> 14:56.400
Ah, Noel! They're finally letting
you drive the Range?

14:56.400 --> 14:58.400
Did you learn your left
from your right?  Ha!

14:58.400 --> 15:00.720
Why are you always
so mean to me?

15:00.720 --> 15:03.480
You hear that, Bulge?
That's bullying, is that.

15:03.480 --> 15:06.200
Noel'll hold on to your phone
for the evening.  I know.

15:09.040 --> 15:11.640
Oh, yes.

15:11.640 --> 15:13.120
I Like what you've done there.

15:13.120 --> 15:15.200
Ah, don't, ah...

15:15.200 --> 15:17.720
They got chipped up, didn't they?

15:17.720 --> 15:19.880
Anybody asks,
you met a friend in the pub.

15:19.880 --> 15:22.840
They'll do a bill. You paid cash.

15:22.840 --> 15:24.920
Landlady'll say anything
we want her to say.

15:24.920 --> 15:28.080
Can she say I were really nice,
dead funny and left a big tip?

15:31.360 --> 15:33.280
You're an absolute joker, you.

16:16.280 --> 16:18.280
Lou!
Oh, lovely to see you, Alma.

16:18.280 --> 16:20.080
Lovely to see you, too.

16:20.080 --> 16:22.680
Oh, you look beautiful.
Ah, thank you, so do you.

16:22.680 --> 16:25.160
Ceri sends his apologies,
but Owen's not very well,

16:25.160 --> 16:27.320
so he's going to stay with him.
Is he all right?

16:27.320 --> 16:29.880
Oh, yeah, just a bug, it's fine.
Oh, good.

16:29.880 --> 16:33.000
All right, Lou!  Bloody hell, Donal,
when did you become your dad?

16:33.000 --> 16:34.600
Trying me best not to!

16:36.120 --> 16:39.880
Go and find him, will you?
Everybody's here.  Mm-hm.  Mm-hm.

16:39.880 --> 16:41.760
I had to send him back up.

16:41.760 --> 16:45.600
The first shirt he came down in
was absolutely horrendous.

16:45.600 --> 16:48.480
So, how are you, Lou?
Fair to middling, Curtis. You?

16:50.080 --> 16:51.520
Life is good.

16:51.520 --> 16:53.080
This is Elise.

16:53.080 --> 16:55.040
Nice to put a face to the name.
Finally.

16:55.040 --> 16:58.240
Oh, usually only see this face
when you've been bad.

16:58.240 --> 17:01.520
Christ! Would you look at this
rabble?

17:01.520 --> 17:03.800
Lord Roy. Darling. Good to see ya.

17:03.800 --> 17:05.200
Elise, nice to see ya.

17:06.920 --> 17:08.520
Bulge.
Boss.

17:08.520 --> 17:10.680
Jesus, Juliet, you're still with us!

17:10.680 --> 17:13.080
Did the last stroke not
finish you off?  Not quite!

17:13.080 --> 17:15.240
Not that this one would've
mentioned it.

17:15.240 --> 17:16.840
Would he? He wouldn't.

17:16.840 --> 17:18.520
Come here you.

17:18.520 --> 17:20.120
Where's the big man?

17:20.120 --> 17:22.080
Couldn't make it cos Owen's poorly.

17:22.080 --> 17:23.880
Oh, he's a good dad.

17:23.880 --> 17:25.400
He is.

17:27.280 --> 17:28.960
Thank you.

17:28.960 --> 17:31.240
Open it alone. Happy birthday.

17:31.240 --> 17:33.400
Very thoughtful of you.

17:33.400 --> 17:36.800
Maybe pop it in the wee safe
for now, Bulge.

17:36.800 --> 17:40.560
Right, well, now you've all finally
decided to turn up, let's eat!

17:42.400 --> 17:44.720
# Happy birthday to you

17:46.000 --> 17:49.280
# Happy birthday to you

17:50.680 --> 17:54.000
# Happy birthday dear Col

17:54.000 --> 17:59.200
# Happy birthday to you. #

17:59.200 --> 18:01.200
Is that our building?
Mm-hm.

18:02.520 --> 18:04.240
Our first building.

18:04.240 --> 18:05.600
Out of many.

18:05.600 --> 18:07.440
APPLAUSE

18:09.440 --> 18:11.760
CHEERING

18:11.760 --> 18:13.920
ALL:  Ohhhh!

18:16.760 --> 18:19.120
Speech! Speech!
Yeah, speech!

18:19.120 --> 18:21.160
Yeah, go on.  You're not getting
away with it, Dad.

18:21.160 --> 18:23.520
I haven't bored you all
enough already?  No, keep going.

18:23.520 --> 18:25.080
Come on.
We love it.

18:26.960 --> 18:29.560
OK, um...

18:29.560 --> 18:32.280
I'll be brief for once.

18:32.280 --> 18:34.720
Err, I'm a lucky man.

18:36.760 --> 18:40.200
Made it to yet another birthday
in a challenging line of work.

18:40.200 --> 18:42.600
Despite some people's best efforts!

18:42.600 --> 18:45.600
It's hard to get close to people
in this business,

18:45.600 --> 18:49.000
but you lot are the people
that I rely on.

18:49.000 --> 18:50.200
People that I love.

18:50.200 --> 18:52.280
People that I trust.

18:52.280 --> 18:54.320
Couldn't ask for more than that.

18:59.880 --> 19:02.080
Well, maybe that's not true.

19:05.120 --> 19:07.040
Alma...

19:07.040 --> 19:10.440
Thank you for throwing it all
away on me, all those years ago.

19:12.040 --> 19:13.800
You remain my world.

19:15.200 --> 19:16.840
Donal, my boy.

19:16.840 --> 19:19.600
We've had our ups and downs,
you know, more downs than ups,

19:19.600 --> 19:22.640
if we're honest,
but I love you, no matter what.

19:22.640 --> 19:26.040
Bulgey,
what would I do without you, eh?

19:26.040 --> 19:29.200
Lord Roy,
the king of the decimal point.

19:31.320 --> 19:34.880
And, err, finally,

19:34.880 --> 19:37.440
our wee guest of honour.

19:37.440 --> 19:40.320
The reason why we're pouring
our own drinks tonight.

19:42.040 --> 19:43.880
I wouldn't be here without you.

19:45.440 --> 19:48.160
So, here's to me, obviously,

19:48.160 --> 19:50.080
but here's to you too, Lou.

19:51.520 --> 19:54.080
To Lou.
ALL:  To Lou!

19:54.080 --> 19:55.960
Right. Cake.

19:58.800 --> 20:00.720
DOOR SHUTS

20:05.240 --> 20:07.760
Alma would castrate me
and strangle me

20:07.760 --> 20:10.520
and then bury me in un-consecrated
ground if she knew.

20:10.520 --> 20:12.560
Ceri would just look disappointed.
Oooh.

20:12.560 --> 20:14.120
Which is worse.
So much worse.

20:15.360 --> 20:17.600
LIGHTER CLICKS

20:24.360 --> 20:26.320
Place looks nice.

20:26.320 --> 20:29.320
Did you paint?
I don't fucking know. Probably.

20:32.560 --> 20:33.800
Listen, about yesterday...

20:33.800 --> 20:36.160
Don't ask me to do
something like that again, Col.

20:36.160 --> 20:38.080
It were too close.
No, I know. I know.

20:38.080 --> 20:39.360
And I'm sorry.

20:40.680 --> 20:42.000
There just wasn't anyone else.

20:42.000 --> 20:43.760
Anyone I could trust, you know?

20:45.360 --> 20:48.760
If I'd sent one of my young lads
to that crime scene, fuck me,

20:48.760 --> 20:51.120
they're leaving half
a pound of chromosomes behind.

20:51.120 --> 20:53.320
If not their fucking
birth certificate.

20:53.320 --> 20:55.760
What the hell happened?

20:55.760 --> 20:58.480
Endri's crew thought
they'd cook gear on my patch.

20:58.480 --> 20:59.720
I thought otherwise.

20:59.720 --> 21:02.240
Sent a couple of the lads down
to press the point,

21:02.240 --> 21:03.640
things got out of hand.

21:03.640 --> 21:05.160
But, look, it's on me.

21:05.160 --> 21:08.000
The shooter's a wee
Barry Big Bollocks.

21:08.000 --> 21:09.640
Should never have used him for this.

21:09.640 --> 21:11.320
Do I know him?

21:11.320 --> 21:12.640
No. no.

21:13.760 --> 21:16.720
He's gone on a nice long
holiday as of this morning.

21:16.720 --> 21:18.440
Tour of southern Europe.

21:21.160 --> 21:22.760
He was still alive.

21:25.640 --> 21:28.080
What?
The lad.

21:28.080 --> 21:29.920
He was still breathing. Just.

21:32.080 --> 21:34.480
But he was dead
when they found him, no?

21:34.480 --> 21:37.320
Which was, what, five minutes
after you were there? Ten?

21:38.720 --> 21:40.840
So, then, past saving.

21:45.320 --> 21:48.280
You've been pushing hard
the last few months.

21:48.280 --> 21:50.960
Just fixing the barn roof
while the sun's shining.

21:50.960 --> 21:52.520
Nothing more than that?

21:52.520 --> 21:54.120
Not that I'm aware of.

21:58.320 --> 22:00.440
And look...

22:00.440 --> 22:02.120
I meant what I said in there.

22:02.120 --> 22:04.360
I would not be where
I am today without you.

22:06.480 --> 22:07.960
Same here.

22:07.960 --> 22:11.240
And you know that, you old git.

22:11.240 --> 22:12.600
Old...

22:17.360 --> 22:19.360
Best head back in separately, eh?

22:19.360 --> 22:21.400
Or they'll think we're shagging.

22:30.680 --> 22:34.000
Nice to see ya'.
Look after yourself.  You, too.

22:36.200 --> 22:38.000
Come on, Curtis.

22:52.120 --> 22:55.760
And get your teeth sorted,
you knobhead, or they'll go bad.

22:55.760 --> 22:59.280
I will, I will. I promise!
Bye, love.

22:59.280 --> 23:00.840
Catch you later.

23:04.280 --> 23:06.800
PHONE VIBRATES

23:17.640 --> 23:20.200
Lou, it's Owen,
just go straight to the hospital.

OUTGOING RINGING TONE

23:23.760 --> 23:26.240
Pick up! Pick up, pick up,
pick up, pick up. Pick up!

23:26.240 --> 23:28.360
VOICEMAIL:  It's Ceri,
leave a message.

23:28.360 --> 23:30.480
Urgh! Fucking hell.

23:41.000 --> 23:42.920
How is he?
I don't know.

23:42.920 --> 23:46.160
The doctor's on his way now.
What happened?

23:46.160 --> 23:48.560
I went in to check on him
about nine, but he was asleep,

23:48.560 --> 23:50.160
so I left him.

23:50.160 --> 23:53.720
I went back in at midnight
and he had this rash. All over.

23:53.720 --> 23:55.400
I couldn't wake him up.

23:55.400 --> 23:58.160
You didn't check on him
for three hours?  What?

23:58.160 --> 24:00.040
He could've been like that
the whole time.

24:00.040 --> 24:02.800
Well, where were you?  You didn't
check on him for three hours?

24:02.800 --> 24:04.400
Mr and Mrs Davies? I'm Dr Bhaskari,

24:04.400 --> 24:06.760
I'm the A&E consultant
on call tonight.

24:06.760 --> 24:09.160
I'm afraid Owen is quite unwell.

24:09.160 --> 24:11.160
He has bacterial meningitis.

24:11.160 --> 24:13.800
Right now we're doing everything
we can to get the cranial

24:13.800 --> 24:16.040
pressure down and help his body
fight the infection.

24:16.040 --> 24:18.560
We really need him to show something
in the next few hours,

24:18.560 --> 24:21.400
but this will be a very long night.

24:21.400 --> 24:23.080
I should get back to Owen.

24:24.520 --> 24:26.040
Don't go anywhere.

24:28.120 --> 24:29.880
They think he's going to die.

26:00.800 --> 26:03.080
Please don't die. Please don't die.

26:03.080 --> 26:05.680
Please don't die.
Please don't die. please don't...

26:16.440 --> 26:18.200
I'll be better.

26:40.200 --> 26:42.280
DOOR CLOSES

26:43.520 --> 26:45.960
FOOTSTEPS

26:49.640 --> 26:51.320
OK. Right...

26:53.800 --> 26:56.280
So, we've still got
a long way to go,

26:56.280 --> 27:00.160
but Owen finally began to respond
to treatment about an hour ago.

27:00.160 --> 27:02.520
Against some stiff odds,
his condition has stabilised.

27:04.280 --> 27:06.440
Back soon to tell you more.
Thank you.

27:29.800 --> 27:32.080
Owen?

27:32.080 --> 27:34.360
Hiya, Owen, love.

27:34.360 --> 27:36.600
It's me and Dad.

27:44.960 --> 27:48.240
Wh-wh-wh...

27:56.680 --> 28:00.760
Hey, it's OK.
You're in hospital, son.

28:00.760 --> 28:02.360
It's OK.

28:04.000 --> 28:05.880
You've been a bit poorly,

28:05.880 --> 28:08.040
but you're OK.

28:10.400 --> 28:13.200
You're going to be all right.

28:13.200 --> 28:16.120
Look at me. You're going to be
all right, I promise.

28:29.760 --> 28:31.400
He could be deaf.

28:32.920 --> 28:34.520
He could be brain damaged.

28:34.520 --> 28:36.240
Can you stop reading that shit?

28:41.360 --> 28:44.040
You're going to have to tell
your mum.

28:44.040 --> 28:46.120
I will. OK, I will.

28:57.840 --> 28:59.720
I should get some air.

29:01.080 --> 29:02.600
See you in a bit.

29:17.120 --> 29:19.760
Is he all right?

29:19.760 --> 29:21.560
He almost died.

29:21.560 --> 29:23.120
Hey, I know.

29:23.120 --> 29:25.560
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

29:27.720 --> 29:29.240
Anything that he needs, OK?

29:29.240 --> 29:31.240
Anything at all. You call me.

29:31.240 --> 29:33.360
Call me.  OK.
Yeah?  Thank you.

29:33.360 --> 29:35.720
You should get back in -
you're exposed.

29:35.720 --> 29:38.000
All right, tell Ceri I...
I will.

29:47.600 --> 29:50.200
The swelling in Owen's
brain has subsided,

29:50.200 --> 29:54.240
but there is some damage.

29:54.240 --> 29:57.160
A bit like he's suffered
a number of small strokes.

29:57.160 --> 30:00.720
So, there will be some
after-effects going forward.

30:00.720 --> 30:03.200
Like what? What are you expecting?

30:03.200 --> 30:05.240
We see things like hearing loss,

30:05.240 --> 30:08.560
memory loss, other cognitive issues.

30:08.560 --> 30:11.320
Problems with movement
and co-ordination.

30:11.320 --> 30:14.080
He will have headaches
and fatigue, for sure.

30:14.080 --> 30:16.920
And there is
the psychological impact.

30:16.920 --> 30:19.240
Jesus Christ...

30:19.240 --> 30:23.320
But do kids die of this, at his age?

30:23.320 --> 30:25.280
Have you seen that?

30:25.280 --> 30:27.360
Certainly.

30:27.360 --> 30:30.080
I have lost young patients
to a MEN B infection.

30:30.080 --> 30:32.880
Others have lost limbs
through sepsis.

30:32.880 --> 30:35.120
Owen might have been very lucky.

30:36.440 --> 30:38.360
We'll know in the next few weeks.

30:45.480 --> 30:47.200
Don't look at your feet.

PHONE BUZZES

30:52.360 --> 30:53.760
Chin up...

30:53.760 --> 30:54.960
..and shoulders down.

30:56.000 --> 30:57.120
I know!

30:58.680 --> 31:00.240
I can walk.

31:00.240 --> 31:01.600
It just kills.

31:04.160 --> 31:05.640
I want to try again.

31:05.640 --> 31:07.080
I won't freak.

31:09.000 --> 31:10.560
Go on, then.

31:10.560 --> 31:14.360
The instinct will be to grip it
tight but try to stay loose.

31:32.560 --> 31:34.280
Mum. Stop helicoptering.

31:35.840 --> 31:37.120
Sorry.

31:37.120 --> 31:39.760
You've been here all day, every day.

31:39.760 --> 31:41.600
I'm just saying.

31:49.120 --> 31:51.240
DRILL WHIRS

31:59.560 --> 32:01.360
Fuck's sake! What it is now?

32:04.600 --> 32:07.560
He wouldn't have been able to
open these, would he?

32:07.560 --> 32:09.080
Not with his hands like they are.

32:25.760 --> 32:28.520
I'm sorry.

32:34.000 --> 32:35.760
Do you remember how you used to...

32:40.920 --> 32:43.320
You sure?
Mm-hm.

32:54.200 --> 32:56.320
I think I'm going to go back
to work.

32:59.400 --> 33:01.320
Are you sure you're ready?

33:01.320 --> 33:02.880
No. But Owen is.

33:04.880 --> 33:07.080
Back to both jobs, you mean?

33:08.480 --> 33:10.480
They go together, Cer.

33:25.680 --> 33:27.640
POLICE OFFICER:  Morning, Ma'am.

33:43.240 --> 33:45.440
Hiya, Slack, are you all right?

33:45.440 --> 33:47.600
That's right, she's back.

33:48.920 --> 33:50.840
Ehhh, look busy!

33:50.840 --> 33:54.240
No, but thank you all
for your cards and messages,

33:54.240 --> 33:56.040
it was much appreciated.

33:56.040 --> 33:58.800
Now, is it safe to assume the great
city of Leeds has become

33:58.800 --> 34:01.760
a teeming crime-infested
cesspit in my absence?

34:01.760 --> 34:04.800
We need to all get back to work,
so, go on, piss off.

34:08.680 --> 34:10.560
Hey. You good?

34:10.560 --> 34:12.160
Yeah.

34:12.160 --> 34:14.200
Really?
Yeah.

34:14.200 --> 34:15.640
It's good to be back.

34:16.960 --> 34:18.240
How is he?

34:18.240 --> 34:19.400
Oh, he's OK, ta.

34:19.400 --> 34:21.960
He gets pain and mobility problems,

34:21.960 --> 34:26.440
and he's tired but he's all there
so...we were lucky.

34:26.440 --> 34:28.040
Good.

34:28.040 --> 34:29.720
We need you back.

34:29.720 --> 34:32.480
We stopped Wilco Wilson's
cousin last week,

34:32.480 --> 34:35.040
usual haul in his boot
plus 26,000 pills.

34:35.040 --> 34:36.800
Oh, he's diversifying then.

34:36.800 --> 34:39.080
And Phil's making headway
with Thomas Ajazi,

34:39.080 --> 34:42.080
but it could do
with your eyes on it. The murder.

34:44.120 --> 34:46.320
Albanian lad?
Shot in the old pub in Bramley?

34:48.280 --> 34:50.960
Happened just before Owen
got ill, yeah. I'll muck in.

34:50.960 --> 34:54.520
Subtly. Don't emasculate him
too much. I know it's tempting.

34:54.520 --> 34:57.440
Oh, and how's about a nice little
post office robbery in Gipton

34:57.440 --> 35:00.880
to ease you back
into the swing of things?

35:00.880 --> 35:04.280
Come on, star pupil,
grab your pencil case.

35:29.160 --> 35:30.960
I knew you'd have run out.

35:30.960 --> 35:33.720
You're all right, you,
I don't care what they say.

35:36.760 --> 35:38.800
You're back just in time.

35:38.800 --> 35:40.560
It were getting embarrassing.

35:40.560 --> 35:43.400
You're the only one who makes
any arrests over street level.

35:43.400 --> 35:44.920
Oh, that's nice.

35:44.920 --> 35:47.960
Do you mind checking for polyps
while you're there?  Eh?

35:47.960 --> 35:50.000
While your head's up my arse.

35:51.960 --> 35:54.520
Quite nice to be going to the
scene of a violent crime

35:54.520 --> 35:56.240
rather than the hospital.

35:58.440 --> 36:01.920
Look, I know you'll just take
the piss, but I prayed for Owen.

36:05.520 --> 36:07.200
Ta.

36:07.200 --> 36:08.960
Took the best part of 12 grand.

36:08.960 --> 36:10.680
All the foreign currency.

36:10.680 --> 36:13.440
We were stocked up for Easter break.
I reckon he knew about it.

36:15.440 --> 36:17.080
And what did he look like?

36:18.840 --> 36:22.440
THEY CONVERSE IN HINDI

36:27.240 --> 36:29.000
He had a balaclava on.

36:29.000 --> 36:30.840
But you could still
see his dodgy teeth.

36:30.840 --> 36:32.520
Dodgy, how?

36:34.160 --> 36:36.720
SPEAKS HINDI

36:41.680 --> 36:44.160
One gold one
and the other one was chipped.

36:47.000 --> 36:49.400
And, erm, what happened here?

36:49.400 --> 36:52.120
Bastard pushed the gun
right in there.

36:52.120 --> 36:55.320
And the ambulance people said
just to put some ice on it.

36:55.320 --> 36:58.280
Can you ask your mum exactly
how it happened?

36:58.280 --> 36:59.720
Last time, we promise.

37:02.320 --> 37:06.320
SPEAKS HINDI

37:16.800 --> 37:19.800
She had her back to the shop
but when she turned around,

37:19.800 --> 37:21.680
he was there.

37:21.680 --> 37:23.920
He already had this funny gun out,

37:23.920 --> 37:26.880
and when she tried to say something
he just shoved it in her face.

37:26.880 --> 37:28.560
It looked antique.

37:28.560 --> 37:30.480
SPEAKS HINDI

37:30.480 --> 37:32.960
Like the Germans have in them
old war films.

37:40.200 --> 37:43.520
I didn't want to give it to him,
but I thought he'd shoot me.

37:57.720 --> 38:00.000
Are you OK?
Yeah.

38:01.440 --> 38:04.080
I've just got low, low blood sugar.

38:04.080 --> 38:05.880
Please don't die.

38:05.880 --> 38:07.440
Lou.

38:10.720 --> 38:12.640
Lou, what you doing?

38:25.560 --> 38:28.400
Lou, where are we going?

38:28.400 --> 38:30.520
Lou!

38:30.520 --> 38:32.760
Noel Wilkes. That's who knocked over
the post office.

38:32.760 --> 38:34.760
That's his dentistry she described.

38:34.760 --> 38:36.960
He's one of Col McHugh's...

38:36.960 --> 38:39.360
Wait, hang on, shouldn't firearms
be doing this arrest?

38:39.360 --> 38:40.840
DOG BARKS

38:40.840 --> 38:43.120
Slack!  You want to nick him,
don't you?

38:44.880 --> 38:46.760
Police!

38:46.760 --> 38:49.440
He won't shoot me,
not if he knows what's good for him.

38:49.440 --> 38:50.840
BABY CRIES

38:53.320 --> 38:55.880
Thanks for this. Just got her down.

38:57.440 --> 38:59.080
Where's your son, Mrs Wilkes?

38:59.080 --> 39:01.000
Don't know. Not here.

39:01.000 --> 39:02.520
Check if you want.

39:10.440 --> 39:12.160
Sorry about that.

39:25.000 --> 39:27.200
PHONE BUZZES

39:27.200 --> 39:29.040
Well, what now?

39:29.040 --> 39:30.320
Crossgates.

39:30.320 --> 39:32.920
There's a barbershop
he hangs out at. Hop in.

39:53.640 --> 39:56.560
Actually, change of plan. I've got
to do something, so get out.

39:58.240 --> 39:59.760
You what?

40:32.280 --> 40:35.240
Just making a wee brew for these
old dears. You want?

40:35.240 --> 40:37.040
I'm OK.

40:37.040 --> 40:39.560
I never thought I'd see you
in a Portakabin.  Don't.

40:39.560 --> 40:41.600
I fucking hate coming down here,

40:41.600 --> 40:45.360
and sometimes they try
and get me in a bloody hard hat.

40:46.840 --> 40:48.720
Seems you're back at work, then, eh?

40:48.720 --> 40:51.080
Yeah. First day.

40:51.080 --> 40:52.880
It was time.

40:52.880 --> 40:54.320
Great. That's great.

40:54.320 --> 40:59.600
Um, so, Belinda Wilkes runs two
nail parlours for me in town.

40:59.600 --> 41:03.640
Bulgey gets a call from her
saying that you'd been round

41:03.640 --> 41:05.400
trying to pinch our Noel.

41:06.760 --> 41:09.720
I didn't even know you were
back at work but even if you were,

41:09.720 --> 41:12.520
why are you trying to pinch
one of ours?

41:12.520 --> 41:14.400
Did you give him that hot gun?

41:17.520 --> 41:19.680
Aye. To get rid of.

41:19.680 --> 41:21.440
Oh, well, he didn't.

41:21.440 --> 41:24.120
He used it to knock over the post
office in Gipton.

41:25.600 --> 41:27.080
He what?

41:28.600 --> 41:32.040
He's got the most recognisable
set of gnashers in Leeds

41:32.040 --> 41:34.360
and he wore a mask
with a mouth hole.

41:38.600 --> 41:39.960
Yeah.

41:39.960 --> 41:41.960
I can't make this one go away, Col.

41:41.960 --> 41:43.800
Everyone knows it's Noel,

41:43.800 --> 41:46.480
so the smart move would be
to give him up.

41:52.720 --> 41:55.600
He's an idiot.
Come on, you know that.

41:55.600 --> 41:59.360
If you give him over to me,
then we can make it work for us.

42:00.600 --> 42:03.480
And how's that?
Plausible deniability.

42:05.440 --> 42:09.720
Makes sense for you to let me pin
something on you every now and then.

42:09.720 --> 42:13.000
Something we can point to
if OCT get us an audit.

42:15.560 --> 42:18.200
You want to be untouchable.
You don't want to look untouchable.

42:21.440 --> 42:23.000
You're absolutely right.

42:23.000 --> 42:25.920
You know, he's fucked up royally,
hasn't he? He's an eejit.

42:25.920 --> 42:29.320
But here's my problem,
he's a loyal eejit.

42:30.880 --> 42:33.200
Trust me - he wouldn't know
about you if he wasn't,

42:33.200 --> 42:36.160
and loyalty is something
that I always return.

42:38.680 --> 42:42.320
But Col, he is going to get nicked
eventually,

42:42.320 --> 42:44.760
and if I handle it,
we get a benefit.

42:44.760 --> 42:46.040
But if it's at a stop and search

42:46.040 --> 42:49.200
in Huddersfield in three months'
time, then we don't.

42:49.200 --> 42:51.320
I know.

42:51.320 --> 42:54.120
All of that makes sense
but the answer is "no."

42:57.400 --> 42:59.280
So drop it.

42:59.280 --> 43:01.240
We'll hide him away for a wee bit.

43:02.760 --> 43:06.080
After that, if he gets pinched,
he gets pinched, but not by you.

43:11.640 --> 43:13.200
Hope Owen gets to come home soon.

43:14.880 --> 43:16.520
And remember, anything you need.

43:16.520 --> 43:19.040
Anything at all, day or night, OK.
Promise?

43:19.040 --> 43:20.800
Promise.

44:09.440 --> 44:11.080
We not going to Crossgates?

44:11.080 --> 44:12.520
Noel's going to be in a safehouse.

44:12.520 --> 44:14.080
You up for an obs?

44:14.080 --> 44:15.720
You went to see an informant.

44:15.720 --> 44:18.560
Yeah, one I have to keep
off the books.

44:18.560 --> 44:20.520
We'll need a RIPA.

44:20.520 --> 44:23.040
Don't need a RIPA to park up
and have a coffee.

44:23.040 --> 44:26.080
The gossip on Wilkes is that he's
rising through the ranks.

44:26.080 --> 44:28.520
Guess he's still just
a scally at heart.

44:28.520 --> 44:30.000
People don't change.

44:30.000 --> 44:31.880
People change.

44:31.880 --> 44:33.880
Just not in the way they want.

44:46.960 --> 44:49.600
What does that look like to you?

44:51.880 --> 44:53.400
Spare trackies,

44:53.400 --> 44:56.360
mixed doner,
and numpty's overnight bag.

45:10.200 --> 45:11.920
Give yourself a chance, Noel.

45:13.800 --> 45:15.400
Lou.

45:15.400 --> 45:18.440
You've found him now,
but we have to bring in firearms.

45:18.440 --> 45:19.920
You know it.

45:39.000 --> 45:40.960
Armed police!

45:40.960 --> 45:43.000
Armed police!

45:43.000 --> 45:45.040
Noel Wilkes!
We know you're in there.

45:45.040 --> 45:47.280
Get down on the floor
with your hands behind your head!

45:47.280 --> 45:49.880
GUNFIRE Shots fired! Shots fired!

45:49.880 --> 45:52.360
I've got a hostage in here.
You come in - I'll start blazin'!

45:52.360 --> 45:54.120
Everybody all right?
All good, all good.

45:54.120 --> 45:56.120
The weapon's live.
He's in the back room.

45:56.120 --> 45:58.840
Says he's got a hostage.
We need the negotiations team.

45:58.840 --> 46:00.080
DC Okoye, you do the honours.

46:00.080 --> 46:02.920
Get some more bodies down here for
crowd control. I'll talk to Noel.

46:02.920 --> 46:04.760
I'm B1 accredited
on crisis mediation.

46:04.760 --> 46:07.200
Plus, he knows me.
Follow me, then.

46:08.360 --> 46:09.800
Stay low.

46:14.760 --> 46:18.560
Noel Wilkes? It's Detective
Inspector Louisa Slack.

46:18.560 --> 46:20.160
We've met a few times.

46:21.440 --> 46:23.280
Well, don't tell me
I'm that forgettable.

46:23.280 --> 46:25.000
What are you doing here?

46:25.000 --> 46:26.600
Can't really talk like this, lad.

46:26.600 --> 46:28.240
You got someone in there with you?

46:28.240 --> 46:30.240
Yeah, an hostage,
so don't try anything!

46:30.240 --> 46:33.200
I'm not a hostage,
I'm his fucking cousin!

46:33.200 --> 46:35.680
How about this for an idea,
why don't you send her out,

46:35.680 --> 46:38.000
I'll come in,
and then we can chat properly?

46:38.000 --> 46:39.440
Can't let you do that.

46:39.440 --> 46:41.800
INAUDIBLE CONVERSATION INSIDE
Shut up, man!

46:41.800 --> 46:44.440
I'm DI Louisa Slack,
the ranking officer on the scene.

46:44.440 --> 46:47.360
I accept full responsibility
for my operational decision

46:47.360 --> 46:50.200
to exchange myself for the hostage,
to prevent loss of life.

46:52.520 --> 46:54.000
What'd you say, Noel?

46:55.400 --> 46:56.960
You come in here first!

46:59.080 --> 47:01.320
All right, I'm coming in.
I'm wearing a shirt and a vest.

47:01.320 --> 47:04.280
I'm not carrying anything, so it'd
be dead decent if you could refrain

47:04.280 --> 47:06.040
from shooting me.

47:11.160 --> 47:13.440
That's it, love.
Hands on your head.

47:13.440 --> 47:15.000
Nice and slow, nice and slow.

47:15.000 --> 47:16.400
You dickhead, Noel!

47:17.320 --> 47:18.760
Hostage coming out.

47:18.760 --> 47:20.320
This way, move.

47:20.320 --> 47:22.880
What's going on, Slack?!  You were
supposed to get rid of that.

47:22.880 --> 47:24.760
What are you doing,
robbing the post office?

47:24.760 --> 47:27.480
I needed cash, didn't I?  If you need
cash then you can just ask him.

47:27.480 --> 47:29.000
No! I couldn't.

47:29.000 --> 47:31.680
I was embarrassed. Look, Bulgey's
already had a go at me all right.

47:31.680 --> 47:33.000
RATTLING AT DOOR

47:33.000 --> 47:34.880
DOG BARKS

47:34.880 --> 47:37.640
It's me dog.
She's good as gold, like.

47:37.640 --> 47:39.160
I didn't want 'em shooting at her.

47:39.160 --> 47:41.360
How are you going to get me
out of this shit?  I'm not.

47:41.360 --> 47:43.480
I'm not your Fairy bloody Godmother.

47:43.480 --> 47:45.840
You wore a ski mask
that showed your mouth!

47:45.840 --> 47:47.560
Fucking hell.

47:47.560 --> 47:50.000
So, what now, then?!
Shh-shh-shh.

47:50.000 --> 47:52.480
What now?!
You go down for it.

47:52.480 --> 47:55.200
What? No, no, no, no, no.

47:55.200 --> 47:57.520
No! Sod that.
This is what you get paid for.

47:57.520 --> 48:00.000
You shut up and you listen to me,
Noel!

48:00.000 --> 48:03.200
There is no way out, OK?
So, be a good soldier.

48:03.200 --> 48:05.640
No comment, head down, do your time.

48:05.640 --> 48:08.400
Col will look after you
and your mum.

48:08.400 --> 48:10.160
Oh...

48:10.160 --> 48:12.120
I've shot at the filth, man!

48:12.120 --> 48:14.680
I'll be an old geezer,
time I come out!

48:14.680 --> 48:17.160
You might not even be 30
if you just keep your nose clean.

48:17.160 --> 48:20.280
I'm sorry, lad,
it has to go down this way.

48:20.280 --> 48:21.920
Oh, God, man.

48:23.640 --> 48:25.800
Is this what the boss wants?

48:25.800 --> 48:28.600
You do right by him,
he'll do right by you.

48:32.840 --> 48:34.680
Oh, man!

48:34.680 --> 48:36.960
EXHALES DEEPLY

48:39.320 --> 48:41.040
He's a good guy, in't he?

48:41.040 --> 48:42.800
He's the best.

48:46.280 --> 48:47.680
Ah, ah, ah, no, no, no.

48:47.680 --> 48:49.560
No, none of that.

48:49.560 --> 48:50.880
Noel!

48:55.840 --> 48:57.440
You'll have to take me dog.

48:57.440 --> 48:59.120
I'll make sure she's looked after.

48:59.120 --> 49:00.920
No, that means doggy prison.

49:00.920 --> 49:03.400
She'll be in some tiny cell
with some messed up staffies

49:03.400 --> 49:06.040
barking at her all night.
You have to take her. Promise me.

49:06.040 --> 49:07.480
I'm really not into dogs.

49:07.480 --> 49:10.560
Trust me, you'll be into Kiwi.
Everybody loves her.

49:10.560 --> 49:11.680
Kiwi?

49:11.680 --> 49:14.040
Come here, girl. Come here.
It's all right.

49:14.040 --> 49:17.400
Sorry, I thought she'd be called
Psycho or Beats or something.

49:17.400 --> 49:20.280
Why Kiwi?
Cos I love kiwis, don't I?

49:20.280 --> 49:22.520
There's more vitamin C than
an orange. You know that?

49:22.520 --> 49:24.080
No...

49:24.080 --> 49:27.080
All right, fine, I'll take her.
I promise. OK?

49:27.080 --> 49:29.160
DOG WHIMPERS

49:29.160 --> 49:31.720
Go on. Go on, Kiwi, in there.

49:31.720 --> 49:32.920
Go on, darling.

49:32.920 --> 49:35.400
It's OK, it's all right,
it's all right.

49:40.640 --> 49:42.360
DOG WHINES SOFTLY

49:44.120 --> 49:46.280
Why'd you have to mess
up the old lady's face?

49:46.280 --> 49:48.200
She's black and blue.

49:48.200 --> 49:51.280
She was looking at me all witchy
like. It shit me up.

49:52.800 --> 49:56.280
Did you shoot Thomas Ajazi?
Who?

49:56.280 --> 49:58.880
That lad in the old pub in Bramley.

49:58.880 --> 50:02.240
No.
I don't know who did that.

50:02.240 --> 50:03.720
It was this gun, Noel.

50:03.720 --> 50:07.680
I swear! I was in Manchester
doing a job for the boss.

50:07.680 --> 50:11.520
But Bulge gave me the strap
and told me to chuck it.

50:11.520 --> 50:13.320
Why you asking this anyway?

50:15.800 --> 50:17.880
Kneel down.

50:17.880 --> 50:19.400
Kneel down.

50:30.640 --> 50:32.840
All clear!

50:32.840 --> 50:35.080
Put your hands on your head!
Do it now!

50:35.080 --> 50:38.040
SHOUTS:  Do it now!
Both hands on your head.

50:38.040 --> 50:39.640
Right, give me your hand.

50:39.640 --> 50:42.000
DI Slack? I can take that now.

50:42.000 --> 50:43.560
Just relax.

50:45.880 --> 50:47.800
Got it. On your feet.

51:00.320 --> 51:01.800
Kiwi!

51:01.800 --> 51:03.600
DOG BARKS

51:05.240 --> 51:07.160
Kiwi!

51:07.160 --> 51:09.000
Good girl.

51:09.000 --> 51:11.560
That's a dog.  Maybe you should've
been a detective.

51:11.560 --> 51:13.360
Oh, it's there.

51:13.360 --> 51:16.040
Whose is it?
It's ours.

51:16.040 --> 51:17.640
OK. Whose was it?

51:19.480 --> 51:20.880
One of Col's lads.

51:20.880 --> 51:23.680
I made a promise, so I...

51:25.720 --> 51:28.000
You all right?

51:28.000 --> 51:29.680
Yeah...

51:31.280 --> 51:33.960
I was thinking maybe later
we could get a takeaway

51:33.960 --> 51:36.760
before the hospital.
Maybe a Thai?

51:36.760 --> 51:39.120
Yeah, bit formal, but.

51:41.800 --> 51:43.760
Here! Here! What's this?

51:45.360 --> 51:46.920
Hello.

51:48.400 --> 51:50.160
What's her name?
Kiwi.

51:50.160 --> 51:52.200
Kiwi?

51:53.640 --> 51:55.920
DOG BARKS

52:02.160 --> 52:03.800
Is it a midlife crisis?

52:06.720 --> 52:09.480
Is it an episode
of undiagnosed mania?

52:10.600 --> 52:12.720
You hate dogs.

52:12.720 --> 52:14.920
Do you get this, Dad?
I'm saying nothing.

52:16.760 --> 52:19.360
I've got this horrible feeling
you got her for me.

52:19.360 --> 52:21.560
These are getting much better.

52:23.480 --> 52:25.040
I'll never get back to where I were.

52:25.040 --> 52:26.760
You don't know that.

52:32.920 --> 52:34.960
570, it's an actual crime.

52:34.960 --> 52:37.680
I could knock up a stairgate thing.

52:37.680 --> 52:40.280
You know, like we had
when Owen was little?

52:40.280 --> 52:42.720
The dog can have the
run of downstairs. Won't take long.

52:42.720 --> 52:44.520
Yeah.

52:46.480 --> 52:48.320
What the fuck's he doing here?

52:51.720 --> 52:54.000
Go home, Cer. I'll deal with this.

52:54.000 --> 52:56.960
Deal with what?
Tell me what's going on.

52:56.960 --> 53:00.240
Now.  It's nothing.
It's just routine. It's fine.

53:00.240 --> 53:02.520
I know that's not true.
What is it?

53:04.080 --> 53:05.720
I just...I...

53:05.720 --> 53:08.680
Just what?
I don't know, Cer.

53:08.680 --> 53:10.840
Something's changed...
What's changed?

53:10.840 --> 53:12.720
I don't know.

53:12.720 --> 53:14.840
I've got to go.
I'll see you at home.

53:14.840 --> 53:18.000
What's changed?
Feed Kiwi.

53:18.000 --> 53:19.760
You don't have to go with him!

53:48.120 --> 53:49.760
On you go.

54:10.640 --> 54:12.320
Stop there.

54:20.640 --> 54:22.720
BANGS AT DOOR

54:53.400 --> 54:55.000
You OK?

54:55.000 --> 54:56.360
Good.

54:56.360 --> 54:57.960
All right?
Mm-hm.

54:57.960 --> 55:00.360
Sorry, I've got shit on you.
Come have a sit.

55:00.360 --> 55:02.280
You ever been to this place?
No.

55:02.280 --> 55:04.120
It's the best kept secret in Leeds.

55:04.120 --> 55:06.680
Asked them to bring a bit of all
their best stuff.

55:06.680 --> 55:08.800
And I've got a nice Rioja
decanted for you, too.

55:08.800 --> 55:11.160
Unless you've already eaten?
No. I'm famished.  Good.

55:12.800 --> 55:14.360
Thank you.

55:14.360 --> 55:17.160
How's Ceri?
Yeah, he's good.

55:17.160 --> 55:19.080
He's got a lot on.

55:19.080 --> 55:21.800
Listen, erm, about Owen.

55:21.800 --> 55:24.720
I know the NHS do their best,
of course they do.

55:26.680 --> 55:28.360
But this place, world beater.

55:30.800 --> 55:33.160
Money's no object, OK?

55:33.160 --> 55:36.200
Just want to do something for him,
Lou - for Owen.

55:36.200 --> 55:38.600
I know I haven't seen him
since he was a wee dot, but...

55:40.080 --> 55:41.760
You know.

55:41.760 --> 55:43.360
Thank you.

55:44.560 --> 55:47.240
You don't have to thank me.
We're partners, aren't we?

55:49.480 --> 55:52.520
You could've got anyone
to deliver those.

55:52.520 --> 55:54.440
What's on your mind?

55:57.040 --> 55:59.400
Your mind is on my mind.

56:03.440 --> 56:06.280
Noel?
Mm-hm.

56:06.280 --> 56:10.160
OK. OCT got an anonymous tip.

56:10.160 --> 56:12.840
It didn't come through me,
so I couldn't kill it.

56:12.840 --> 56:15.120
Best I could do
was to get ahead of it,

56:15.120 --> 56:17.360
and make sure that Noel
didn't get himself shot,

56:17.360 --> 56:19.760
and then I reminded him
that you'd be there for him.

56:19.760 --> 56:21.800
Who the fuck do you think I am?

56:27.920 --> 56:31.000
It's just that you come to me
wanting to take him and I say "no."

56:31.000 --> 56:34.920
And then the very same night,
I find out that you've nicked him,

56:34.920 --> 56:38.320
at a safehouse that only you
and five other people know about.

56:43.960 --> 56:46.120
Six others.

56:46.120 --> 56:48.200
He had his cousin with him.

56:50.040 --> 56:52.800
She brought supplies,
they got stoned, she slept over.

56:52.800 --> 56:56.200
So, obviously,
he told her the address,

56:56.200 --> 57:00.680
and she told...well, who knows?

57:05.800 --> 57:08.960
So, the mouth hole wasn't even the
stupidest thing he's done this week.

57:10.880 --> 57:12.440
Fucking eejit.

57:13.720 --> 57:16.040
Well, it looks like you've
turned it into a benefit for us

57:16.040 --> 57:17.600
which is good.

57:17.600 --> 57:21.240
But, um, this can never happen
again, Lou, OK?

57:24.200 --> 57:25.680
Ever.

57:29.720 --> 57:31.440
You promise me that?

57:37.560 --> 57:39.200
No.
