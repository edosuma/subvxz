What are we doing here, Robin?

00:31.865 --> 00:33.658
- Are we going the fishing?
- Nope.

00:33.742 --> 00:35.660
- Doing some whale watching?
- Nuh-uh.

00:35.744 --> 00:37.495
Hitting up the maritime museum?

00:37.579 --> 00:39.038
No.

00:39.122 --> 00:42.208
Titans, we are here
for a far more
important reason.

00:42.292 --> 00:44.544
We are going on a cruise.

00:48.757 --> 00:51.634
I love
being trapped on a boat.

00:51.718 --> 00:56.347
Welcome Titans, to the
Trans Oceanic Magical Cruise.

00:56.431 --> 00:57.974
Or the T-O-M Cruise for short.

00:57.974 --> 01:00.810
Whoa! Check this place out.

01:00.894 --> 01:03.980
It's got a stage show
with a real life vampire.

01:03.980 --> 01:06.816
And a legendary petting zoo.

01:06.900 --> 01:09.527
And an awesome race track.

01:09.611 --> 01:11.279
Well, if you think that's cool,

01:11.279 --> 01:13.615
check out
the Impossible Buffet.

01:13.615 --> 01:15.158
Oh, yeah!

01:15.158 --> 01:18.203
I'mma get me a cheeseburger-
lobster-rib steak-apple pie.

01:20.038 --> 01:21.498
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:21.498 --> 01:23.875
You can't just go waltzing in
to the Impossible Buffet.

01:23.875 --> 01:25.627
Why not?

01:25.627 --> 01:27.962
Because it's guarded
by the world's most advanced
security system.

01:28.046 --> 01:32.342
And one false move could
get you blown to smithereens.

01:38.348 --> 01:40.850
Thank you for visiting
the Impossible Buffet.

01:40.934 --> 01:43.645
Whoa, isn't that
a little extreme for a buffet?

01:43.645 --> 01:47.190
Everything the T-O-M Cruise
does is a little extreme.

01:47.190 --> 01:51.444
So how does one gain access
to the Impossible Buffet?

01:51.528 --> 01:53.530
Through that
small vent in the ceiling.

01:53.530 --> 01:57.575
Ooh! Getting in there sounds
like an impossible mission.

01:57.659 --> 01:59.202
Yeah, let's do this.

02:00.537 --> 02:02.872
Robin, I can lower you down
using this.

02:05.250 --> 02:06.709
Sounds good, but be careful.

02:06.793 --> 02:09.045
Yeah, yeah just get in the hole.

02:09.045 --> 02:11.131
Easy, a little to the left.

02:11.131 --> 02:12.382
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

02:12.382 --> 02:13.758
A little to the right.

02:14.634 --> 02:15.552
Perfect.

02:19.556 --> 02:20.890
Come on, man.

02:20.974 --> 02:22.600
Sorry, I couldn't help it.

02:22.684 --> 02:24.894
Yeah, no way he can
carry that much food

02:24.978 --> 02:26.604
with his tiny,
little baby hands.

02:26.688 --> 02:28.314
I do not have baby hands.

02:28.398 --> 02:29.774
Step aside, my dude,

02:29.858 --> 02:31.359
and let me
show you how it's done.

02:34.112 --> 02:35.488
Careful!

02:35.572 --> 02:37.907
Hush your mouth, fool,
and grab me some muffins.

02:42.829 --> 02:45.248
Oh, give me a break, bro,
you had that.

02:45.248 --> 02:46.916
Let's go again.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.334
No way, you just went.

02:48.418 --> 02:51.254
- Oh! Oh! I wish to have the turn.
- Me too!

02:52.171 --> 02:53.464
Cut it out up there.

02:56.092 --> 02:57.260
Ow! I got some food.

02:57.260 --> 02:58.469
Now pull me up.

02:59.929 --> 03:00.930
What you get?
What you get?

03:02.223 --> 03:04.350
A lousy French fry?

03:04.434 --> 03:06.477
Don't nobody want your
sad looking fry.

03:06.561 --> 03:08.396
Where are we gonna eat now?

03:08.396 --> 03:10.982
Well, the theater
probably has snacks.

03:15.528 --> 03:17.739
- Raven, you're a genius, girl.
- Great.

03:17.739 --> 03:20.158
Now keep it down.
I really wanna see this play.

03:20.158 --> 03:21.451
What's the name of it?

03:21.451 --> 03:23.244
Ooh! <i>Interview With
a Bloodsucker.</i>

03:23.328 --> 03:25.705
Ooh! Sounds so terrifying.

03:25.705 --> 03:28.291
Yeah, that sounds
super scary, yo.

03:30.877 --> 03:32.337
Welcome, Mr. Vampire.

03:32.337 --> 03:34.797
What job are you
interviewing for today?

03:34.881 --> 03:37.508
I wanna be a dance instructor.

03:37.592 --> 03:39.510
Tell me,
why should I hire you?

03:39.594 --> 03:42.055
I have just
always wanted to teach dance.

03:42.055 --> 03:43.681
You know, I gotta dance.

03:43.765 --> 03:45.475
Everybody just
keeps biting people.

03:45.475 --> 03:48.311
I was just, like,
"It's about the dance, man."

03:48.311 --> 03:50.063
Aw, mans, this ain't scary.

03:50.063 --> 03:52.023
It's just a straight-up
job interview.

03:52.023 --> 03:53.650
I cannot watch this.

03:53.650 --> 03:56.152
- Let's bounce, yo.
- I'm gonna hang back.

03:56.152 --> 03:59.322
I'm a real sucker
when it comes to vampires.

03:59.322 --> 04:00.448
Ha-ha.

04:02.367 --> 04:03.660
Well, that was a bust.

04:03.660 --> 04:05.161
No doubt. What now?

04:05.161 --> 04:06.746
What do you
wanna do next, yo?

04:06.746 --> 04:10.166
Perhaps we could visit the
legendary petting zoo.

04:10.166 --> 04:11.918
Sure, but you go ahead.

04:11.918 --> 04:15.338
- I need a minute alone with Cyborg and Beast Boy.
- Okay.

04:15.338 --> 04:17.090
Listen, guys,

04:17.090 --> 04:18.549
I think this cruise
is the perfect
and most romantic place

04:18.633 --> 04:20.843
to tell Starfire
how much I care for her.

04:20.927 --> 04:22.512
Oh, I get it.

04:22.512 --> 04:26.683
You want to turn this ship into
your own personal love boat.

04:26.683 --> 04:28.518
So exciting and new.

04:28.518 --> 04:31.938
Exactly, but it's
never going to happen
with you two hanging around.

04:31.938 --> 04:34.190
No problemo, yo.
We'll gets lost.

04:34.274 --> 04:36.192
But first you gots
to show us the money.

04:36.192 --> 04:37.777
Excuse me?

04:37.777 --> 04:40.697
You heard the man. If you want
us gone, you gotta pay up.

04:40.697 --> 04:41.990
Seriously?

04:41.990 --> 04:45.118
Say it with me one time,
"Show us the money."

04:45.118 --> 04:47.620
Show us the money.

04:47.704 --> 04:49.622
Now it say
all proper like Alfred.

04:49.706 --> 04:51.541
Show us the money.

04:51.541 --> 04:53.835
Now dark and gritty
like Batman.

04:53.835 --> 04:55.712
Show us the money.

04:55.712 --> 04:57.046
Now say it like Starfire.

04:57.130 --> 05:00.550
Glorious! The show,
the us, the money.

05:00.550 --> 05:03.302
You are over
the edge, baby.

05:03.386 --> 05:05.013
And I love that about you.

05:07.098 --> 05:09.017
Now take this
and get out of here.

05:09.017 --> 05:11.144
A pleasure
doing business with you, bro.

05:11.144 --> 05:12.186
Hey!

05:14.147 --> 05:19.027
Oh! There are so many
of the wonderful animals here.

05:28.244 --> 05:29.412
Listen, Star,

05:29.412 --> 05:30.997
I'm really
nervous to tell you this,

05:30.997 --> 05:32.415
so I'm just gonna say it.

05:32.415 --> 05:34.542
You complete--

05:35.752 --> 05:38.337
Well, hello there,
Mr. Unicorn.

05:38.421 --> 05:40.173
Aren't you the adorable?

05:40.173 --> 05:43.551
I shall name you
the Sugarcone.

05:45.011 --> 05:46.137
Get lost, Sugarcone.

05:46.137 --> 05:47.764
I'm trying to say
something important.

05:49.599 --> 05:51.642
You complete--

05:54.020 --> 05:56.481
Yo, we definitely
gots to try this.

05:56.481 --> 05:58.274
Okay, but I warn you

05:58.274 --> 05:59.776
when it comes to driving,

05:59.776 --> 06:01.819
I'm an underdog
looking for something to prove.

06:01.903 --> 06:03.946
Oh, yeah?
Well, when it comes to flying,

06:04.030 --> 06:06.282
I'm an underdog
looking for something to prove.

06:06.282 --> 06:10.620
Then let's race to see
who's the most underdoggiest
underdog there is.

06:10.620 --> 06:12.371
I'm in.

06:45.738 --> 06:47.824
I got the need for speed.

06:53.037 --> 06:54.038
Yo, hey!

06:56.415 --> 06:57.875
So you wanna play rough?

07:03.089 --> 07:04.423
Where did he go?

07:04.507 --> 07:05.675
I'm right here, bro.

07:05.675 --> 07:07.218
Smile for the camera.

07:09.345 --> 07:10.680
See you at the finish line.

07:10.680 --> 07:12.140
We'll just see about that.

07:17.145 --> 07:18.855
He's got me on missile lock.

07:18.855 --> 07:21.065
Good thing I brought
a little collateral.

07:24.861 --> 07:26.195
Goose!

07:26.279 --> 07:27.446
That tears it.

07:29.657 --> 07:31.284
Man, that's a life saver.

07:31.284 --> 07:34.787
Oh, yeah? Well, ain't nothing
gonna save you from this.

07:52.972 --> 07:55.474
Oh, mans.

07:55.558 --> 07:58.936
Now, we'll never know
the answer to who
the true underdog is.

07:59.020 --> 08:01.105
- You wants the answer?
- I want the truth.

08:01.189 --> 08:04.275
- You wants the answer?
- I want the truth.

08:04.275 --> 08:06.402
We's both true underdogs.

08:06.402 --> 08:07.570
What?

08:07.570 --> 08:09.197
We're never gonna win!

08:12.200 --> 08:14.452
This T-O-M Cruise is the best.

08:14.452 --> 08:17.997
I'm so glad we got
a chance to take this vacation.

08:17.997 --> 08:19.165
It is pretty great.

08:19.999 --> 08:21.209
Yes, it is.

08:21.209 --> 08:23.628
- Except for the aliens.
- What aliens?

08:44.899 --> 08:46.984
Ahhh! Why they's
attacking us?

08:47.068 --> 08:50.613
Because, the T-O-M Cruise
always gets attacked by aliens.

08:50.613 --> 08:52.156
And you knew this?

08:52.240 --> 08:54.617
Of course.
It's why I booked this cruise.

08:54.617 --> 08:56.160
So we can put a stop to it.

08:56.244 --> 08:58.371
But we don't have enough power
to stop those things.

08:58.371 --> 08:59.789
Yes, we do.

08:59.789 --> 09:03.876
We can use the power
of the T-O-M Cruise!

09:03.960 --> 09:05.461
Aw, yeah!

09:24.981 --> 09:26.440
Spin and hold and flip,

09:26.524 --> 09:27.942
spin and launch.

09:27.942 --> 09:30.111
<i>♪ Dance instructor ♪</i>

09:53.134 --> 09:55.886
I's going to send
you aliens into <i>Oblivion.</i>

09:58.389 --> 10:01.267
Beast Boy, get me close enough
to plant this bomb.

10:01.267 --> 10:02.935
Roger that.

10:04.020 --> 10:05.646
Oh, sorry, bro.

10:07.148 --> 10:08.149
My bad.

10:08.149 --> 10:10.484
Stop, stop, stop.

10:12.153 --> 10:14.196
Don't worry, bro,
I got this.

10:23.622 --> 10:26.167
Nice work, Titans.
We did it.

10:26.167 --> 10:27.752
Them aliens
weren't so tough,

10:27.752 --> 10:29.879
I could beat them
with my <i>Eyes Wide Shut.</i>

10:29.879 --> 10:33.382
We kicked their alien booties
<i>Far and Away.</i>

10:33.466 --> 10:36.469
And straight into
the <i>Edge of Tomorrow.</i>

10:37.636 --> 10:39.722
Did you hear that
<i>Tropic Thunder?</i>

10:39.722 --> 10:42.016
Just a second ago it was
a <i>Vanilla Sky.</i>

10:42.016 --> 10:43.726
Now the difference is
<i>Knight and Day.</i>

10:43.726 --> 10:45.811
We better get below deck
before it storms.

10:45.895 --> 10:49.315
No need to be so
<i>The Firm,</i> Robin.

10:49.315 --> 10:51.275
Yeah, it's just
a little <i>Rain Man.</i>

10:51.359 --> 10:55.654
That's not rain coming from
those <i>Magnolia</i> shaped clouds.

10:55.738 --> 10:57.531
It's frogs.

11:01.994 --> 11:04.955
This T-O-M Cruise is nuts, man.
