00:05.589 --> 00:09.441
(mysterious music)

00:09.659 --> 00:12.511
(water rippling)

00:23.182 --> 00:24.982
(car approaching)

00:41.283 --> 00:42.499
(message chimes)

00:48.865 --> 00:51.258
(phone keys clicking)

01:07.884 --> 01:12.738
(♪♪)

01:15.575 --> 01:19.161
(clunking)

01:25.569 --> 01:27.068
- "step into the future"
is good,

01:27.070 --> 01:28.829
But I wanna wrap up
the presentation with

01:28.831 --> 01:30.147
An aspirational statement.

01:30.149 --> 01:32.666
Something like,
"you can live in the future,

01:32.668 --> 01:34.000
In your exquisitely designed,

01:34.002 --> 01:36.169
Zero-carbon village green home,

01:36.171 --> 01:37.745
That is not only
self-sustaining,

01:37.747 --> 01:40.023
But also helping
to save the planet."

01:40.342 --> 01:42.167
- That's really great, helen.

01:42.169 --> 01:44.845
Oh, the messaging is so much
clearer than it was a week ago.

01:44.847 --> 01:46.563
- Thank you. But I still feel

01:46.565 --> 01:48.098
Like it needs something
about family.

01:48.100 --> 01:49.966
Or protecting your family.

01:49.968 --> 01:52.369
- Maybe drop in
a couple touchstone words

01:52.371 --> 01:54.154
Like "secure" and "resilient."

01:54.156 --> 01:56.281
- Yeah, that's good.
That covers everything.

01:56.283 --> 01:58.242
Thanks, judy.
(phone chimes)

02:04.516 --> 02:05.715
(sighs)

02:06.352 --> 02:08.960
That is the third reminder
about my meeting with

02:08.961 --> 02:09.953
Taylor's teachers next week.

02:09.955 --> 02:11.955
- I'm meeting with
miles's teachers tomorrow.

02:11.957 --> 02:14.616
- Honestly, I am hoping
they have some advice for me.

02:14.618 --> 02:16.618
This thing with taylor's
not getting any better.

02:16.620 --> 02:19.120
- Hmm.
- We used to share everything,

02:19.122 --> 02:20.638
And it's like,
the past few weeks...

02:20.640 --> 02:22.649
(message chimes)
... He can barely even
look at me.

02:22.651 --> 02:24.184
- I remember miles
in middle school.

02:24.186 --> 02:27.604
He thought he was too cool
for everyone, especially me.

02:28.140 --> 02:29.480
- Well, you may have noticed,

02:29.482 --> 02:31.875
Taylor's not exactly
the "too cool" type.

02:31.877 --> 02:34.219
He's happiest in his room
playing his video game.

02:34.888 --> 02:37.898
I don't know. Lately,
it seems like he's escaping

02:37.900 --> 02:39.299
More and more into his games.

02:39.301 --> 02:41.201
Like, just wants to shut out

02:41.203 --> 02:43.144
The real world for some reason.

02:43.146 --> 02:44.237
- Any idea what's wrong?

02:44.239 --> 02:46.415
(sighs)
- I'm worried
he's being bullied.

02:46.976 --> 02:48.525
- Oh, gosh, I hope not.

02:48.527 --> 02:50.318
- Yeah. There was this kid

02:50.320 --> 02:52.487
A few years back, in his class,
who would just

02:52.489 --> 02:54.247
Relentlessly harass him.

02:54.249 --> 02:56.233
Taylor wouldn't even
go to school.

02:56.235 --> 02:57.600
- You think it's the same kid?

02:57.602 --> 02:59.428
- Uh--
(phone chimes)

03:03.166 --> 03:05.742
Hey, I would love for you
to come by the village green
site sometime.

03:05.744 --> 03:07.777
- I... I can't wait to see it.

03:08.338 --> 03:11.915
Uh, I will be back in a few
with miles and dessert.

03:11.917 --> 03:13.233
- Thank you.

03:15.362 --> 03:16.445
Hey.

03:18.607 --> 03:19.923
Earth to taylor.

03:20.292 --> 03:22.759
- Mom, I'm texting with someone.

03:23.262 --> 03:28.832
- Well, could you text someone
after you set out the plates?

03:32.438 --> 03:33.670
Thank you.

03:36.357 --> 03:38.508
Talk to me.
- About what?

03:39.135 --> 03:40.301
(chuckles)

03:40.303 --> 03:42.036
- I can tell something's
bothering you.

03:42.598 --> 03:45.891
- The only thing
that's bothering me
right now is all this.

03:46.602 --> 03:47.725
- All what?

03:47.727 --> 03:48.969
- This dinner, mom.

03:48.971 --> 03:50.996
- You used to love
our family dinners.

03:50.998 --> 03:52.839
- You're making my science award
a big deal

03:52.841 --> 03:54.357
And it really isn't.

03:54.359 --> 03:56.451
- Well, we all think
it's amazing

03:56.453 --> 03:57.778
And we wanna celebrate you.

03:59.898 --> 04:05.035
(tender music)

04:07.022 --> 04:08.755
- Let's get this party started!

04:08.757 --> 04:09.906
- Thank you so much for coming.

04:09.908 --> 04:11.875
We're so glad you could
both be here tonight.

04:11.877 --> 04:13.126
- Uh... Okay.
- Good job.

04:13.128 --> 04:16.112
Hey, you are famous, my friend.
Look at this. Look.

04:16.113 --> 04:20.132
Here. Hadley register did
a huge article on you.

04:20.135 --> 04:21.677
- Wha... ?
- Aw!

04:22.654 --> 04:23.619
Hey.

04:23.621 --> 04:25.430
- Ooh, thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

04:25.765 --> 04:28.158
- So, how's it going with
have a heart?

04:28.160 --> 04:30.644
- We've launched last week.

04:30.646 --> 04:31.919
- Wait, how did I miss that?

04:31.921 --> 04:34.331
- You didn't.
We did a soft launch

04:34.333 --> 04:36.366
Just to get the app up.
I'll send you a link.

04:36.368 --> 04:38.402
- Oh, and they also got
four major updates, too.

04:38.404 --> 04:41.512
- Which is not unusual for
a healthcare app.

04:41.514 --> 04:43.139
Or any other kind of app.

04:43.141 --> 04:45.675
- Well, you have been working
at this for so long.

04:45.677 --> 04:47.694
Just please, let me know if
I can help with anything.

04:47.696 --> 04:49.179
- I appreciate that.

04:49.606 --> 04:51.881
It's not at the level of
village green yet,

04:51.883 --> 04:54.108
But uh, I'm getting there.

04:54.711 --> 04:56.136
- You're my best friend, judy.

04:56.138 --> 04:58.279
And you are doing a great job.
I'm so proud of you.

04:58.281 --> 05:00.298
(chuckles)
cheers.

05:00.300 --> 05:01.541
- Cheers.

05:01.543 --> 05:07.823
(gentle music playing in car)

05:07.825 --> 05:08.765
(music stops)

05:16.667 --> 05:18.508
(miles and taylor speaking
indistinctly)

05:18.510 --> 05:20.602
- Make it 10, make it 10.
- All right.

05:20.604 --> 05:22.237
- 10, 10. Ready?

05:23.365 --> 05:25.231
- Woo-hoo!

05:25.834 --> 05:27.701
- Sorry I'm late, everyone!

05:28.244 --> 05:30.336
Soccer practice went way,
way over, and then,

05:30.338 --> 05:32.005
I promised I'd give olivia
a ride home.

05:32.007 --> 05:34.148
And then, she asked if
I'd give avery a ride home too,

05:34.150 --> 05:36.576
And I couldn't say no because
we was, like, five feet away.

05:36.578 --> 05:38.211
- We'll discuss it later, gia.

05:40.599 --> 05:42.132
- Did I miss anything?

05:43.034 --> 05:44.775
- Mom and judy are just
talking about work

05:44.777 --> 05:47.361
And miles is apparently
the next golden boot winner.

05:47.363 --> 05:49.455
- Yeah, I heard you rocked
oregon state playoffs.

05:49.457 --> 05:51.383
- Yeah, I did.
(message chimes)

05:51.385 --> 05:52.809
- Go, you.

05:59.443 --> 06:01.626
- I can see you, gia.

06:01.628 --> 06:02.819
- Who are you texting?

06:03.404 --> 06:04.570
- None of your business.

06:04.572 --> 06:05.622
- What's going on?

06:05.624 --> 06:07.783
- I think taylor's
texting a girl.

06:08.226 --> 06:09.442
- Oh, dude.

06:09.444 --> 06:11.619
(chuckling)

06:11.621 --> 06:12.870
(judy): Dinner's on!

06:12.872 --> 06:13.955
Oh, let's get a photo with

06:13.957 --> 06:16.107
The three of you together before
we sit down at the table.

06:16.109 --> 06:17.617
- Mom, can you--
- there literally must be

06:17.619 --> 06:20.187
1,000 photos of the three
of us on your phone.

06:20.189 --> 06:21.137
- So?
(scoffs)

06:21.139 --> 06:22.238
- This is an important night.

06:22.240 --> 06:23.723
Come on. Come on.

06:23.725 --> 06:27.460
(judy): Oh, look at you three!
You're gorgeous!

06:27.462 --> 06:28.719
- How's this?

06:28.721 --> 06:31.531
(laughing)
- perfect. Smile.

06:31.533 --> 06:32.974
(chuckling)
(camera clicks)

06:33.726 --> 06:35.251
(gia): That's a classic!

06:35.253 --> 06:37.287
Mom, look at miles's selfies.

06:37.730 --> 06:39.664
- Those are funny, but why
don't you show them

06:39.666 --> 06:41.024
The rock-climbing photos?

06:42.218 --> 06:45.403
- Ooh, ooh, here's one with
taylor and me

06:45.405 --> 06:46.671
From a few months back.

06:46.673 --> 06:48.648
We need to go back out there
again, yeah?

06:48.650 --> 06:50.783
It's been too long.
- That'd be great.

06:50.785 --> 06:54.337
- Well, let's not forget why
we gathered here tonight.

06:54.339 --> 06:56.072
Taylor, we are so proud of you.

06:56.074 --> 06:57.257
(exhales)

06:57.259 --> 06:58.241
- To taylor.

06:58.243 --> 06:59.834
- Taylor!
- Taylor!

07:00.178 --> 07:02.178
- Taylor's excellence
in science award is

07:02.180 --> 07:03.930
A great reminder to all of us.

07:03.932 --> 07:05.932
If we work hard, don't give up,

07:05.934 --> 07:09.636
And push our goals to the next
level, good things can happen.

07:10.747 --> 07:12.839
Your father would be
really proud of you.

07:12.841 --> 07:16.142
(soft piano music)

07:16.144 --> 07:18.519
- Hey, did you see the photo in

07:18.521 --> 07:20.004
The hadley register of miles

07:20.006 --> 07:22.440
Scoring the winning goal in
last week's soccer game?

07:22.442 --> 07:24.434
(chuckles)
- of course. It's on my wall.

07:24.436 --> 07:25.843
- He's a beast!

07:25.845 --> 07:26.878
- Hmm.
- Whoa.

07:26.880 --> 07:28.104
(giggles)
- a beast who'd better boost

07:28.106 --> 07:30.323
His scoring stats before
the end of the season.

07:32.995 --> 07:36.496
Only 3 % of high school soccer
players end up playing at

07:36.498 --> 07:40.392
Ncaa schools, and even
fewer get scholarships.

07:40.394 --> 07:42.018
- And I'm working on it.

07:42.020 --> 07:44.554
- Well, we will all be
cheering for you.

07:44.556 --> 07:45.780
- Thank you.

07:45.782 --> 07:46.864
(soft chuckles)

07:46.866 --> 07:48.032
(phone buzzes)
(gia): Hey, you going to

07:48.034 --> 07:49.809
Sophia's surprise party
on Saturday?

07:49.811 --> 07:50.719
- Yeah, I'm going.

07:50.721 --> 07:53.363
Did you hear about the dj
that they hired?

07:53.365 --> 07:55.289
- Yeah! They're amazing.

07:55.291 --> 07:56.866
- Am I gonna see you there,
taylor?

07:56.868 --> 07:57.851
(phone keys clicking)

07:57.853 --> 08:00.061
Taylor.
- What?

08:00.063 --> 08:03.482
- Hello? Am I gonna see you
at the party... ?

08:05.068 --> 08:06.251
- I wasn't invited.

08:06.661 --> 08:08.970
- Oh yeah, it's not a formal
thing, it's just, you know,

08:08.972 --> 08:11.664
Anybody who knows sophia could
just show up, right? It's...

08:11.666 --> 08:12.949
- Uh, I don't know.

08:12.951 --> 08:15.660
Avery is sophia's bestie
and she invited me.

08:16.154 --> 08:20.473
(melancholic music)

08:20.475 --> 08:22.675
- Taylor? Are you okay?

08:22.677 --> 08:26.012
- I'm fine, mom.
- Do you want me to ask avery
if you're invited?

08:26.014 --> 08:27.029
- No, it's okay.

08:27.532 --> 08:29.132
Parties aren't really my thing.

08:30.018 --> 08:31.927
(miles): Taylor, buddy, I...

08:35.173 --> 08:37.224
(exhales)
I'm... I'm sorry.

08:37.226 --> 08:38.691
I just... I honestly don't
think

08:38.693 --> 08:40.208
He needs an invite, though,
right? He just--

08:40.211 --> 08:41.227
- It's okay.

08:43.332 --> 08:47.900
- Hey, best behaviour
at sophia's party, right?

08:47.902 --> 08:50.028
- Yeah. Yeah, of course, yeah.

08:55.786 --> 08:57.077
(phone chimes)

08:58.080 --> 08:59.763
- Hmm. Good news.

08:59.765 --> 09:02.215
Avery says you are invited
to sophia's party, t.

09:02.217 --> 09:04.217
- Did you beg her to invite me?

09:04.219 --> 09:04.918
- No.

09:04.920 --> 09:06.286
I just asked if
there was a list,

09:06.288 --> 09:08.630
And she said there is
and you are on it.

09:09.608 --> 09:12.092
- Okay, can we take a minute?

09:15.313 --> 09:17.388
I know that you both have
super busy lives,

09:17.390 --> 09:20.367
But we made a pact a few years
back to always be here,

09:20.369 --> 09:21.851
On time, for all family dinners.

09:21.853 --> 09:24.187
- Tonight wasn't my fault, mom.
- And I understand, gia,

09:24.189 --> 09:28.817
But moving forward, can we
please just make extra effort?

09:29.494 --> 09:30.277
- Yeah.
- Yes.

09:30.279 --> 09:31.945
- Of course.
- Good.

09:31.947 --> 09:34.405
Now, tell me about this sophia?

09:34.407 --> 09:35.331
- Sophia bliss?

09:35.817 --> 09:39.910
She's beyond, beyond the most
popular human at hadley high.

09:39.912 --> 09:41.971
- She's also captain of
the math team.

09:41.973 --> 09:44.833
And we're lab partners
in chemistry class.

09:46.419 --> 09:49.086
What is it?
- Well, who were you
texting with earlier?

09:49.088 --> 09:52.299
(taylor sighs)
pretty sure I saw the name
emma on your phone.

09:52.801 --> 09:54.592
Do you have a girlfriend, t?

09:54.594 --> 09:57.804
- Uh, I guess emma's
sort of a girlfriend.

09:57.806 --> 09:59.597
I met her playing
force for good.

09:59.599 --> 10:01.157
- Your video game?
- Yes.

10:01.159 --> 10:04.502
And she's incredibly smart.
And nice.

10:04.504 --> 10:06.179
And she goes to winton high.

10:06.648 --> 10:10.257
- Why don't you take this emma
to sophia's party?

10:10.259 --> 10:12.335
- We've only been texting
each other for a couple weeks.

10:12.337 --> 10:14.704
- Oh, okay! So, you haven't
met her?

10:14.706 --> 10:16.097
Like, in real life?

10:16.099 --> 10:17.490
- We text all the time.

10:18.951 --> 10:21.786
- What am I missing?
- Emma could be a bot.

10:21.788 --> 10:24.030
Or someone could be
pretending to be emma.

10:24.032 --> 10:25.272
- That's not funny.

10:25.274 --> 10:28.084
She's completely
and totally real.

10:32.073 --> 10:33.614
- Come on.
- Don't.

10:33.616 --> 10:36.176
(phone keys clacking)

10:38.238 --> 10:39.429
(message chimes)

10:42.901 --> 10:48.855
(soft music)

10:56.948 --> 10:58.664
- She'd love to go
to the party with me.

10:58.666 --> 11:00.591
(squealing): Yes!
- Yes!

11:00.593 --> 11:01.684
(laughing)

11:02.654 --> 11:05.162
(helen): This is a place where
we can all live in the future,

11:05.164 --> 11:08.666
In our exquisite,
zero-carbon homes.

11:08.668 --> 11:11.544
This is village green.

11:11.546 --> 11:13.170
Ever green.

11:13.172 --> 11:14.421
Forever home.

11:14.423 --> 11:15.923
(clapping)

11:15.925 --> 11:16.883
Thank you.

11:21.589 --> 11:24.006
- I know I'm new
to the kpl team, but for me,

11:24.008 --> 11:26.851
That was... Wow! That was
an amazing presentation.

11:26.853 --> 11:29.396
I would love to sign up
for village green.

11:29.398 --> 11:30.730
- That's very kind of you
to say.

11:30.732 --> 11:32.565
- Well, with any luck,
barnes investments will be

11:32.567 --> 11:34.525
Equally impressed
with village green's

11:34.527 --> 11:38.154
Very enthusiastic
lead architect, too.

11:38.573 --> 11:39.739
- Thank you.

11:40.275 --> 11:41.524
- Jack.

11:41.960 --> 11:43.350
- Jack.
- Yeah.

11:43.352 --> 11:44.828
- Uh, if you'll excuse me.

11:45.296 --> 11:46.371
- Yeah.

11:47.465 --> 11:48.689
(indistinct chatter)

11:48.691 --> 11:50.374
(taylor): When exposed
to the light,

11:50.376 --> 11:52.201
Photosynthesis occurs and...

11:52.203 --> 11:54.620
- Is it... Is it supposed
to be green?

11:54.622 --> 11:56.489
- Yeah, then we expose it
to the light

11:56.491 --> 11:58.800
And then, what happens--
- is the assignment done?

11:59.561 --> 12:01.635
- Yeah, that's it.

12:01.637 --> 12:03.546
- I got a c on last week's
chemistry test,

12:03.548 --> 12:05.365
So I need this to be perfect.

12:05.367 --> 12:08.034
- It's perfect, sophia.
I promise.

12:08.036 --> 12:09.376
- Thank you.

12:09.712 --> 12:11.646
You're coming to my surprise
party, aren't you?

12:13.475 --> 12:15.792
- Uh... Yeah.

12:16.219 --> 12:18.127
But isn't it supposed
to be a surprise?

12:18.129 --> 12:20.580
- Weird how you're so smart
yet so clueless.

12:20.582 --> 12:21.889
The surprise party was my idea.

12:21.891 --> 12:24.409
Do you think my parents
could get dj rad?

12:25.003 --> 12:25.835
Never.

12:25.837 --> 12:28.830
- Ha! Taylor's never
heard of dj rad.

12:29.899 --> 12:31.007
- Are you talking to me?

12:31.009 --> 12:33.042
- Hello, king of extra credit.

12:35.964 --> 12:38.831
Boom. No light, oxygen.

12:38.833 --> 12:41.017
- Boom? Really?

12:41.019 --> 12:44.678
Wow! Amazing that you didn't get
the hadley science award

12:44.680 --> 12:45.972
This year instead of taylor.

12:45.974 --> 12:49.767
And heads up, you're not
invited to my party,

12:49.769 --> 12:52.353
So don't show up because
the doorman won't let you in.

12:52.355 --> 12:54.564
- Yeah, well, heads up
to you too, princess.
(camera clicks)

12:54.566 --> 12:57.417
No one ever tells me
what I can and can't do.

12:57.419 --> 12:58.692
Ever.

12:58.694 --> 13:00.845
- You're so scary, lucas.

13:00.847 --> 13:02.371
(threatening music)

13:02.373 --> 13:05.325
Mrs. Rennie, taylor
and princess are done.

13:06.177 --> 13:07.026
(chuckles)

13:07.028 --> 13:12.081
(soft tense music)

13:42.497 --> 13:46.491
(♪♪)

13:55.961 --> 13:57.210
- Can I help you?

13:58.096 --> 13:59.254
- Hi, again.

14:02.183 --> 14:03.499
- What are you doing in here?

14:03.501 --> 14:05.510
- Oh, I just uh...

14:08.106 --> 14:09.939
Back in chicago, at the firm
I used to work at,

14:09.941 --> 14:11.440
I used to get
my fellow architects

14:11.442 --> 14:14.418
A fun little gift
to celebrate their big wins.

14:14.846 --> 14:17.096
Anyhow, I wanted to get you
a special gift,

14:17.098 --> 14:19.181
But I realized I know
nothing about you,

14:19.183 --> 14:23.319
Except le petit canard is
your favourite restaurant.

14:23.771 --> 14:26.781
So, who is helen parker?

14:28.026 --> 14:29.775
- I'm kpl's top architect.

14:29.777 --> 14:32.561
- Yeah, yeah, but I mean,
but beyond all that?

14:33.114 --> 14:35.439
Are you all just work
and family,

14:35.441 --> 14:37.876
Or deep down, are you a...

14:38.886 --> 14:39.878
Wild one?

14:43.891 --> 14:47.293
- I am a mother of
two amazing kids.

14:47.295 --> 14:48.385
They're my life.

14:48.387 --> 14:49.870
And my husband, daniel,

14:49.872 --> 14:51.656
Passed two years ago.

14:51.658 --> 14:53.975
Is that enough intel
for you, jack?

14:55.637 --> 14:57.378
- I'm so sorry.
I, I didn't mean--

14:57.380 --> 14:59.606
- I think you should probably
leave my office.

15:05.997 --> 15:06.946
(sighs)

15:09.484 --> 15:10.742
(message chimes)

15:17.166 --> 15:19.459
(lights buzzing)

15:44.202 --> 15:48.154
(ominous music)

15:57.215 --> 15:59.115
(giggling)

15:59.684 --> 16:01.517
- Oh, world's biggest nerd

16:01.519 --> 16:04.128
Probably got a b instead of
his usual straight a's.

16:04.130 --> 16:05.279
(giggling)

16:05.281 --> 16:06.422
Bye.

16:09.051 --> 16:09.950
Hey!

16:09.952 --> 16:11.719
(taylor): That was not cool.

16:12.647 --> 16:15.139
- Come on, taylor.
- I heard you, gia.

16:15.141 --> 16:17.875
You call me the world's
biggest nerd and then you laugh?

16:17.877 --> 16:19.726
I'd never do that to you.

16:19.728 --> 16:21.521
- You're right. I'm sorry.

16:21.523 --> 16:23.314
It was a stupid joke.

16:25.076 --> 16:26.442
I think it's just...

16:27.078 --> 16:27.968
- What?

16:28.471 --> 16:30.697
- It's not always easy being
the not genius sister

16:30.699 --> 16:32.048
To my genius brother, okay?

16:32.050 --> 16:34.325
- What are you talking about?
You're super smart.

16:34.977 --> 16:36.643
- I don't have a 4.0 gpa

16:36.645 --> 16:38.554
And academic awards
all over my wall.

16:38.556 --> 16:40.039
- Well, if it makes you
feel any better,

16:40.041 --> 16:41.757
I hate the attention.

16:41.759 --> 16:42.875
Hate the awards.

16:42.877 --> 16:45.003
- Please just forgive me, okay?

16:48.507 --> 16:49.757
What's wrong?

16:50.652 --> 16:52.969
- Someone taped another note
to my jacket.

16:54.096 --> 16:57.098
It's my photo from the hadley
register with knives.

16:59.251 --> 17:01.394
"ready for the fun to begin,
king of the losers?

17:01.396 --> 17:03.730
See you at sophia's party."
(scoffs)

17:05.415 --> 17:07.066
- Look, I know you wanna let
this all slide,

17:07.068 --> 17:08.401
But they're threatening you now.

17:09.028 --> 17:12.012
Those knives with the blood
are next-level scary.

17:12.013 --> 17:13.606
You need to take this
and the other notes

17:13.608 --> 17:16.242
To principal ramirez
and you need to tell mom.

17:17.295 --> 17:19.846
- Maybe I just shouldn't go
to sophia's party.

17:19.848 --> 17:21.046
- What? No!

17:21.449 --> 17:24.133
Come on, you can't cancel
on your date with emma.

17:24.135 --> 17:26.102
I know how much
this means to you.

17:26.104 --> 17:28.253
Don't let this creep ruin
your life.

17:29.440 --> 17:30.605
(sighs)

17:30.607 --> 17:34.969
(house music)

17:34.971 --> 17:36.804
(door opening)

17:46.757 --> 17:49.292
(gia singing): Ooh,
are you ready?

17:49.735 --> 17:51.652
(speaking): What? What's wrong?

17:52.280 --> 17:53.813
- She's not answering my texts.

17:53.815 --> 17:57.817
- Just call her, t.
Her text-only rule is not cool.

17:57.819 --> 17:59.243
And very sketchy.

17:59.921 --> 18:00.820
(sighs)

18:00.822 --> 18:02.330
(dialling)

18:04.851 --> 18:06.667
<i> (voicemail): Your call has</i>
<i> been forwarded to</i>

18:06.669 --> 18:08.853
<i> An automatic voice message--</i>
(beeps off)

18:08.855 --> 18:11.839
- It's fine. Come on,
let's just go!

18:12.483 --> 18:13.633
- It's fine.

18:13.635 --> 18:15.760
You go. I'll stay here.

18:17.188 --> 18:21.182
(upbeat club music)

18:30.919 --> 18:33.861
(cheering)

18:35.523 --> 18:36.739
- Hi!

18:46.292 --> 18:47.700
- Hey!
- Oh.

18:47.702 --> 18:50.419
- Come on! Dance with me!
- Okay.

18:50.421 --> 18:51.671
(laughs)
- okay.

18:52.198 --> 18:53.797
- Hi, I'm gia!
- I know.

18:53.799 --> 18:56.025
I've seen you at school.
I'm delaney.

18:56.027 --> 18:58.194
- Do you go to hadley high?
- Yeah, I think I'm in

18:58.196 --> 18:59.786
A chemistry class with
your brother, taylor.

18:59.788 --> 19:02.031
- Yeah, her and her dad moved
here about a month ago.

19:02.033 --> 19:03.140
- No way!
- Mm-hmm.

19:03.142 --> 19:04.867
- My dad works with your mom
at kpl.

19:04.869 --> 19:06.126
- Such a small world!

19:06.128 --> 19:08.312
- Yeah, but wait, wait.
Where's... Where's taylor at?

19:08.314 --> 19:09.738
- Oh!
- He's supposed to be in here.

19:09.740 --> 19:12.466
- Long story. He's dealing
with some stuff.

19:12.468 --> 19:14.694
He decided to stay home.
- Oh.

19:14.696 --> 19:15.778
- Yeah.

19:16.580 --> 19:18.305
(laughs)

19:18.807 --> 19:21.384
- Hi!
- Hi! Happy birthday!

19:21.386 --> 19:22.910
- Thank you!

19:23.872 --> 19:25.663
(cheering)

19:31.287 --> 19:35.298
(♪♪)

19:40.221 --> 19:42.922
- Is every guy at hadley high
in love with sophia bliss?

19:42.924 --> 19:44.306
(chuckles)
- they might be!

19:44.308 --> 19:46.759
- Great. Just another entitled
rich girl who thinks

19:46.761 --> 19:48.685
We only exist for
her own amusement.

19:48.687 --> 19:50.563
- What?
- Nothing.

19:50.565 --> 19:54.734
(laughing and cheering)

19:58.372 --> 19:59.380
(knocking on door)

19:59.382 --> 20:02.033
(cheering over vr headset)

20:08.532 --> 20:10.750
(bell dings over vr headset)

20:24.982 --> 20:26.766
- Did gia tell you
what happened?

20:27.477 --> 20:28.768
- She did.

20:29.978 --> 20:31.520
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

20:32.540 --> 20:35.132
- I went back and looked
at my texts with emma.

20:35.134 --> 20:37.944
What if gia's right
and emma's not real?

20:38.721 --> 20:41.313
- First of all, I can't believe
anyone would be that cruel.

20:41.315 --> 20:43.323
- Or I'm the world's
biggest loser.

20:43.325 --> 20:45.284
- You are not a loser.

20:48.222 --> 20:49.996
Do you remember
that rafting trip

20:49.998 --> 20:51.456
We took to the grand canyon?

20:51.909 --> 20:54.093
- Of course. It was one of
the best things

20:54.095 --> 20:56.045
I've ever done
in my entire life.

20:57.615 --> 20:59.740
And it was our last vacation
with dad.

20:59.742 --> 21:02.343
(sentimental music)

21:02.345 --> 21:05.354
- You know what I remember most
about that trip?

21:05.356 --> 21:08.466
Your incredible bravery
on the colorado river.

21:08.468 --> 21:09.374
(soft chuckle)

21:09.376 --> 21:12.995
You were 13 and these enormous
waves were just

21:12.997 --> 21:16.582
Crashing down on us,
all around us, in the boat,

21:16.584 --> 21:17.817
And you...

21:19.319 --> 21:21.195
You just kept on paddling.

21:22.072 --> 21:24.106
You stayed present

21:24.108 --> 21:26.041
And in the moment.

21:26.043 --> 21:28.286
And you kept us moving forward.

21:29.346 --> 21:30.879
That's who you are.

21:31.307 --> 21:33.749
I see it in everything you do.

21:34.452 --> 21:38.004
And it inspires me
to do the same.

21:40.224 --> 21:42.216
You just keep on paddling.

21:49.158 --> 21:50.599
- I'll try, mom.

21:59.067 --> 22:01.919
(siren wailing)

22:01.921 --> 22:06.157
(suspenseful music)

22:21.082 --> 22:23.215
(knocking on door)

22:25.586 --> 22:27.553
(doorbell dings)

22:32.193 --> 22:34.477
- Can I help you with something?
- Are you helen parker?

22:34.479 --> 22:37.521
- Yes, I'm helen.
Is something wrong?

22:37.523 --> 22:39.665
- A young woman's dead body
was found at city park

22:39.667 --> 22:41.049
About an hour ago.

22:41.051 --> 22:42.201
(gasps)

22:42.203 --> 22:43.502
Oh, my god, please.

22:43.504 --> 22:45.537
Not my daughter, gia.
- It's not your daughter.

22:45.539 --> 22:47.490
Is your son
taylor parker home?

22:47.492 --> 22:50.951
- Yes, of course,
he's in his room. Why?

22:50.953 --> 22:53.179
- I have a warrant
to arrest taylor parker

22:53.181 --> 22:55.147
For the murder of sophia bliss.

22:56.050 --> 22:59.543
- What are you talking about?
There's gotta be some
kind of mistake.

23:01.956 --> 23:04.965
(car approaching)

23:08.720 --> 23:12.139
(indistinct police radio
chatter)

23:13.101 --> 23:14.450
Okay, where are you taking him?

23:14.818 --> 23:17.177
(gia): Mom!
- You can't just take him, guys.

23:17.179 --> 23:18.687
- Mom, what is this?!

23:18.689 --> 23:20.188
- Honey, sophia bliss is dead

23:20.190 --> 23:21.523
And they think that
taylor murdered her.

23:21.525 --> 23:23.492
- That's completely insane!
(helen): He was with me

23:23.494 --> 23:25.127
All night. Tell them
you were here with me, taylor.

23:25.129 --> 23:27.070
(officer): Okay, let's go.
(gia): No, stop!
Come on.

23:27.072 --> 23:29.156
(gia): You're making a huge
mistake! My brother would never!

23:29.158 --> 23:31.266
He didn't kill anyone!
(helen): Taylor!

23:31.268 --> 23:32.234
(gia): Are you listening to me?!

23:32.236 --> 23:34.035
(helen): Taylor, tell them
you were here!

23:34.037 --> 23:35.103
(gia): Taylor!

23:35.105 --> 23:36.580
(indistinct police radio
chatter)

23:36.582 --> 23:38.207
- You can't just take him.

23:39.151 --> 23:40.509
- Ladies, calm down.

23:40.511 --> 23:42.594
After he's been processed,
he's gonna be transferred

23:42.596 --> 23:44.179
To the hadley juvenile
detention centre.

23:44.181 --> 23:45.847
Somebody will contact you
in the morning.

23:45.849 --> 23:47.591
(gia sobbing)
(helen): No.

23:48.819 --> 23:50.386
- Mom!

23:50.388 --> 23:51.820
- Taylor.

23:51.822 --> 23:52.888
Taylor, no.

23:54.158 --> 23:55.340
Taylor!

23:55.342 --> 23:56.558
Taylor!

23:56.560 --> 23:57.810
(gia): Mom!

23:59.838 --> 24:03.399
(siren wails)

24:05.486 --> 24:07.945
- It's okay. It's okay.

24:07.947 --> 24:09.763
<i> (journalist): Our victim,</i>
<i> sophia bliss,</i>

24:09.765 --> 24:11.690
<i> Had just celebrated</i>
<i> her sweet 16th birthday</i>

24:11.692 --> 24:12.949
<i> With friends and family.</i>

24:12.951 --> 24:13.868
Hours later, she was found

24:13.870 --> 24:16.445
Dead in city park.
This is breaking news

24:16.447 --> 24:18.271
<i> And we expect a full update</i>
<i> from hadley police</i>

24:18.273 --> 24:19.748
<i> At the top of the hour.</i>

24:26.540 --> 24:27.965
- Thank you.

24:29.860 --> 24:31.468
- Did they call back?

24:31.470 --> 24:32.377
- Not yet.

24:32.379 --> 24:33.879
(doorbell dings)

24:33.881 --> 24:35.931
(door creaks opens)

24:43.357 --> 24:44.406
(sighs)

24:44.408 --> 24:46.375
- I know you're probably
not hungry,

24:46.377 --> 24:47.860
But just in case.

24:48.387 --> 24:49.778
- Thank you, friend.

24:50.572 --> 24:51.813
- Do you want some coffee?

24:51.815 --> 24:53.990
I just made some for mom.
- That would be nice.

24:53.992 --> 24:54.950
Thank you, sweetie.

24:58.222 --> 24:59.513
Any news?

25:00.257 --> 25:02.841
- Nothing yet. He's being
transferred over

25:02.843 --> 25:04.568
To the detention centre
and then, they're gonna call

25:04.570 --> 25:06.395
And let me know when
I can go see him.

25:06.397 --> 25:07.587
(exhales)

25:07.589 --> 25:10.591
Can you imagine taylor in
such a horrible place?

25:12.737 --> 25:16.905
- I hate to do this, but I have
to tell you something.

25:16.907 --> 25:18.999
But I want you to know that
it does not mean that

25:19.001 --> 25:20.893
I think that taylor did
anything wrong.

25:21.520 --> 25:23.111
Okay, we both know
he's a good kid and--

25:23.113 --> 25:25.481
- Okay, just tell me what
you're trying to tell me, judy.

25:27.509 --> 25:29.735
- Um, you know
I'm a terrible sleeper,

25:30.512 --> 25:33.405
And uh, I was up late
last night.

25:33.407 --> 25:37.359
And I saw taylor running down
the street, our street,

25:37.361 --> 25:38.777
Just after 1 a.M.

25:38.779 --> 25:40.429
- He was in bed.

25:40.431 --> 25:41.747
- Well, he must have snuck out.

25:41.749 --> 25:43.749
- Taylor doesn't sneak out.
You know him.

25:43.751 --> 25:45.951
- It was him.
- You saw someone else.

25:45.953 --> 25:48.203
Or maybe somebody
that looked like him.

25:48.205 --> 25:49.471
- Look I, I... Like I said,

25:49.473 --> 25:52.541
I don't think that
taylor killed anyone.

25:52.543 --> 25:57.012
And I'm not gonna say
anything to the police.

25:57.815 --> 26:00.290
But helen, just talk to him.

26:00.292 --> 26:03.560
Maybe he went for a walk
or to meet a friend.

26:03.954 --> 26:06.605
But you should find out
where he went.

26:07.382 --> 26:09.291
- No. This is...

26:09.293 --> 26:11.485
None of this is true!

26:12.362 --> 26:13.487
(sighs)

26:25.342 --> 26:27.293
(keyboard clacking)

26:28.420 --> 26:33.507
(ominous music)

26:36.837 --> 26:38.053
(beep)

26:57.724 --> 27:01.201
(crying softly)

27:05.766 --> 27:06.999
- Mom?

27:07.001 --> 27:08.108
- Gia.

27:08.110 --> 27:09.718
- Sorry, I...

27:09.720 --> 27:11.536
I was just coming
to check on you.

27:11.538 --> 27:13.313
I didn't want to disturb you.

27:13.315 --> 27:14.840
- No, it's okay. Come in.

27:14.842 --> 27:16.216
(sniffling)

27:17.595 --> 27:20.379
- You know that this is just
a huge mix-up, right?

27:20.972 --> 27:23.231
It was late
and judy was half asleep.

27:23.233 --> 27:25.475
It's not like she saw
sophia's murder.

27:26.036 --> 27:28.896
How can the police arrest him
on such random evidence?

27:29.406 --> 27:30.606
- I don't know.

27:31.909 --> 27:33.776
But I need to show you
something.

27:34.820 --> 27:37.613
(keys clacking)

27:38.248 --> 27:39.406
(beep)

27:44.204 --> 27:46.822
- There has to be a perfectly
innocent explanation.

27:47.257 --> 27:48.757
I mean, it's taylor, mom.

27:48.759 --> 27:52.244
- As they were taking him away,
he wouldn't even speak to me.

27:52.246 --> 27:54.487
And when he was in the back of
the police car,

27:54.489 --> 27:55.673
He was just...

27:56.567 --> 27:58.901
Staring out at me with this...

27:58.903 --> 28:00.552
This look.

28:01.422 --> 28:03.263
I'd never seen it before.

28:04.575 --> 28:05.974
And it scared me.

28:07.185 --> 28:09.912
I know in my heart
taylor's innocent,

28:09.914 --> 28:12.080
But where did he go last night?

28:12.082 --> 28:14.817
- I don't know,
but he didn't do this.

28:28.290 --> 28:32.734
(birds chirping)

28:32.736 --> 28:34.645
They were out there all night.

28:34.647 --> 28:35.887
And all morning.

28:35.889 --> 28:37.756
It's plastered everywhere.
All over the news

28:37.758 --> 28:39.474
And online that
he's the murderer.

28:39.476 --> 28:41.977
Like, if you didn't know
taylor, you'd think he did it,

28:41.979 --> 28:43.553
Just based on how
they're presenting it.

28:43.555 --> 28:46.598
Yeah, whatever happened
to innocent until
proven guilty, right?

28:49.186 --> 28:50.727
(camera shutter snaps)

28:50.729 --> 28:51.770
Hang on, olivia.

28:53.983 --> 28:57.609
Hey! This is private property,
you vulture!

28:59.763 --> 29:00.946
(teary sigh)

29:21.885 --> 29:26.764
(melancholic music)

29:37.167 --> 29:38.692
(door lock buzzes)

29:56.086 --> 29:58.036
(helen): Hi.
- Hi.

29:58.038 --> 30:01.298
- Are you okay?
Have you eaten anything?

30:04.386 --> 30:07.763
Taylor, I saw the home
security video

30:07.765 --> 30:09.348
And I know that
you left last night.

30:09.350 --> 30:12.317
- It's not what you think.
- I don't think anything yet.

30:12.319 --> 30:15.354
But I need to know
what happened.

30:15.956 --> 30:19.441
(♪♪)

30:20.310 --> 30:22.152
Where did you go?

30:26.074 --> 30:29.993
- Last night, after you left
my room, I got a text from emma.

30:30.937 --> 30:32.496
She apologized for not
showing up,

30:32.498 --> 30:36.333
And then asked me to meet her
at city park, so I snuck out.

30:38.228 --> 30:40.912
And when I got to the park,
sophia bliss was there.

30:40.914 --> 30:42.931
- Did sophia send you the texts?

30:42.933 --> 30:45.400
- No, she told me
she'd received a text

30:45.402 --> 30:47.135
To meet up with someone, too.

30:49.439 --> 30:51.990
- We were both catfished.
- Catfished?

30:51.992 --> 30:54.259
That's when someone's pretending
to be someone else online?

30:54.261 --> 30:56.078
- Yeah, online
and with texts, too.

30:56.080 --> 30:58.438
And loser me,
I'm a perfect target.

30:59.674 --> 31:01.099
But I promise you, mom,

31:01.101 --> 31:04.236
Sophia and I laughed about
how we fell for the fake texts,

31:04.238 --> 31:05.437
And then, we said goodnight.

31:05.439 --> 31:07.589
And she was in a hurry
to get back to her party

31:07.591 --> 31:09.074
Before anyone noticed
she'd snuck away

31:09.076 --> 31:11.726
And I even offered to walk her
to her car, but...

31:12.295 --> 31:14.037
She insisted that she was fine

31:14.039 --> 31:15.956
'cause she'd parked less
than a block away.

31:17.951 --> 31:20.635
She was alive when
I left that park.

31:20.637 --> 31:21.962
(dramatic boom)

31:27.060 --> 31:29.010
- I think whoever catfished me,

31:29.012 --> 31:32.472
Or both of us, murdered sophia.

31:33.158 --> 31:35.041
And mom, they're still
out there.

31:35.043 --> 31:36.818
I mean, what if they come
after you or gia next?

31:36.820 --> 31:41.322
- You listen to me. I can be
a very fierce mama bear.

31:41.324 --> 31:42.774
So, you don't worry about us.

31:44.978 --> 31:47.613
I am gonna do everything
in my power

31:47.615 --> 31:50.032
To clear you and get you home.

31:54.729 --> 31:57.831
(dog barking in distance)

32:03.897 --> 32:04.963
- Here.

32:06.483 --> 32:07.582
- How's he doing?

32:08.176 --> 32:10.285
- He's having
a really hard time.

32:10.287 --> 32:11.737
I mean, can you imagine
being locked up?

32:11.739 --> 32:14.138
He's never even been kept
after school for detention.

32:14.140 --> 32:15.999
- Yeah, I know, it's just,
you know, hopefully,

32:16.001 --> 32:17.517
They just, they figure out

32:17.519 --> 32:19.645
That he has got nothing to do
with any of this and they just,

32:19.647 --> 32:21.772
They just let him come home
'cause it's just...

32:22.499 --> 32:24.273
- We gotta stay strong, right?

32:24.275 --> 32:27.185
- You're right. Yes, I...
I know. It's just...

32:27.954 --> 32:30.305
I don't want anything bad
to happen to him.

32:30.857 --> 32:34.993
And I can't believe sophia's...
She's... She's dead. I...

32:35.362 --> 32:36.703
- Me either.

32:38.123 --> 32:39.197
None of this feels real.

32:39.199 --> 32:42.000
(phone rings)

32:44.946 --> 32:46.188
- Hey. Where are you?

32:46.190 --> 32:47.589
<i>I thought you'd be home by now.</i>

32:47.591 --> 32:50.141
- I need you to go through
taylor's gaming laptop.

32:50.511 --> 32:53.028
- What, the police don't
have it?
<i> - No.</i>

32:53.030 --> 32:54.196
<i> Apparently, they only grabbed</i>

32:54.198 --> 32:56.231
<i> His school laptop</i>
<i> and his cell phone.</i>

32:56.233 --> 32:57.816
Taylor said it was in his desk

32:57.818 --> 32:59.542
On the shelf when
they dragged him out.

32:59.544 --> 33:01.561
I don't know, maybe
they overlooked it,
I don't know,

33:01.563 --> 33:03.646
<i> But I need you to go</i>
<i> through that. All of his texts</i>

33:03.648 --> 33:05.073
<i>Are backed up on that computer.</i>

33:05.075 --> 33:07.167
<i> I want you to go through them.</i>
<i>See if there's anything in there</i>

33:07.169 --> 33:08.901
<i> That might help us figure out</i>
<i> who was sending them.</i>

33:08.903 --> 33:10.895
- Okay. I'll do it right now.
<i> - Okay, thanks, honey.</i>

33:10.897 --> 33:12.322
I'll be home soon.

33:23.102 --> 33:25.243
Thank you for meeting
with me on a Sunday.

33:25.245 --> 33:27.045
- It's part of my job,
mrs. Parker.

33:27.047 --> 33:29.322
- Please, call me helen.
- Okay, helen.

33:29.324 --> 33:32.858
Um, I spoke with a detective
at the hadley police department

33:32.860 --> 33:34.435
Who claims the reason they were
able to get

33:34.437 --> 33:36.855
That quickie arrest warrant
last night is because

33:36.857 --> 33:38.173
They had a reliable witness

33:38.175 --> 33:39.765
Who saw taylor running
from the scene.

33:39.767 --> 33:42.277
And they sent the police
a timestamped photo of him.

33:42.279 --> 33:44.813
Also, taylor doesn't deny that

33:44.815 --> 33:46.523
He was at the park with sophia.

33:47.184 --> 33:48.850
- That doesn't prove anything.

33:48.852 --> 33:50.935
Have the police tracked
the catfish texts

33:50.937 --> 33:52.087
That were sent to taylor?

33:52.089 --> 33:52.845
- The texts were sent

33:52.847 --> 33:54.172
From a burner phone.

33:54.516 --> 33:56.199
- Shouldn't that help him?

33:56.201 --> 33:57.391
He was lured to the park.

33:57.393 --> 33:59.244
- Unless we can prove
to the police that

33:59.246 --> 34:01.270
The burner phone belongs
to someone else,

34:01.272 --> 34:02.789
It won't help taylor.

34:04.025 --> 34:05.541
- So, what are you saying?

34:05.543 --> 34:08.210
- The police are convinced that
the murder was well planned

34:08.213 --> 34:09.779
And that taylor created

34:09.781 --> 34:12.382
This elaborate catfish story
as an alibi.

34:13.868 --> 34:15.310
- So, they're convinced that

34:15.312 --> 34:18.280
My son texted himself from
a burner phone

34:18.282 --> 34:20.315
So that he could murder
a girl he barely knew?

34:20.317 --> 34:22.225
- I'm in no way saying
that taylor's guilty.

34:22.226 --> 34:23.559
This is just me letting you,

34:23.561 --> 34:25.545
The mother of my client,
know all the facts,

34:25.547 --> 34:28.130
So that we can figure out
the best way forward.

34:28.132 --> 34:32.235
(tense music)

34:34.389 --> 34:36.072
(gia): Ah, found it.

34:36.449 --> 34:37.491
- Hmm.

34:40.228 --> 34:41.369
- Thanks.

34:43.748 --> 34:46.208
(computer whirring)

34:50.996 --> 34:53.465
(gloomy music)

34:53.467 --> 34:54.983
- What... What is it?

34:54.985 --> 34:57.010
- Taylor likes to hide things.

35:27.084 --> 35:29.358
(chuckles)
sneaky, t.

35:29.360 --> 35:31.219
- Oh, that was a good catch.

35:31.221 --> 35:33.939
- Well, I might not get all
the awards like taylor does,

35:33.941 --> 35:36.641
But my dad always used
to tell me

35:36.643 --> 35:38.760
I'm smart in my own special way.

35:49.480 --> 35:53.667
(ominous music)

35:53.669 --> 35:55.193
- It's a gift for emma.

35:59.307 --> 36:02.325
(rain pattering)

36:05.264 --> 36:06.488
- Hi!
- Hi.

36:06.490 --> 36:08.756
I thought you could use
a friend right now.

36:08.758 --> 36:11.734
And a coffee.
- I do.

36:11.736 --> 36:15.730
- It's your usual skinny latte
with an extra shot of espresso.

36:15.990 --> 36:18.049
- You're the best. Thank you.

36:18.585 --> 36:21.269
Hey, um, I hate to ask this,

36:21.271 --> 36:22.662
But did you tell the police that

36:22.664 --> 36:25.198
You saw taylor running down
the street last night?

36:25.775 --> 36:28.852
- Well, I told you that
I wasn't gonna say anything.

36:30.580 --> 36:32.338
Do you really think that
I would lie to you?

36:32.340 --> 36:34.523
- No. No, no. It's just...

36:34.525 --> 36:37.693
Taylor's lawyers said that
they have a reliable witness

36:37.695 --> 36:39.988
And I just can't seem to think
who would've seen him

36:39.990 --> 36:41.356
And be able to identify him.

36:41.358 --> 36:43.842
- Oh, well, it wasn't me.

36:44.602 --> 36:47.445
Do you think this whole thing
might be making you...

36:47.447 --> 36:48.847
A little paranoid?

36:49.274 --> 36:51.132
- Yeah, you're probably right.

36:51.134 --> 36:52.417
(camera clicks)

36:54.604 --> 36:56.688
Great. Welcome to my new life.

36:56.690 --> 36:59.791
If somebody's not glaring at me,
they're taking a picture of me.

36:59.793 --> 37:02.385
I feel like I can't even go
to the grocery store anymore.

37:02.387 --> 37:04.971
- Let's get you home.
- Good idea.

37:09.569 --> 37:14.356
(mysterious music)

37:32.334 --> 37:33.917
(knocking)

37:41.025 --> 37:42.283
(jack): Hi.
- Hi.

37:42.285 --> 37:44.761
- It's jack from
your mom's office.

37:48.724 --> 37:49.957
- What are you doing here?

37:49.959 --> 37:52.918
- Hi. Don't worry. I heard about
everything that's going on

37:52.920 --> 37:54.920
In the news, and I just wanted
to come by and say

37:54.922 --> 37:57.957
I know taylor is
completely innocent.

37:57.959 --> 38:02.737
And also, I thought you two
might need a delicious dinner.

38:04.157 --> 38:05.365
- Okay.

38:10.063 --> 38:11.871
(dog barking in distance)

38:11.873 --> 38:15.875
(winds howling)

38:17.153 --> 38:19.087
- Sorry I'm so late.

38:21.558 --> 38:22.798
Jack.

38:22.800 --> 38:24.550
What are you doing?

38:24.552 --> 38:26.711
- I'm, uh, warming up
your dinner.

38:26.713 --> 38:28.430
- So, you think you can just
show up here

38:28.432 --> 38:30.281
And push your way into my house?

38:30.283 --> 38:31.966
- No, not at all. I...

38:31.968 --> 38:34.310
I'm just the delivery guy.

38:34.312 --> 38:37.397
- He's just heating it up
for us, mom. Relax.

38:41.569 --> 38:43.061
- I'm a jerk.

38:43.063 --> 38:44.362
That was awful.

38:44.364 --> 38:46.906
Can you just pretend you didn't
hear anything I just said?

38:46.908 --> 38:50.201
- Did you just say something?
I'm sorry, I missed it.

38:50.920 --> 38:52.162
- Thank you.

38:52.806 --> 38:55.331
And thank you for this.

38:55.333 --> 38:57.149
It's my favourite food.
I'm starving.

38:57.151 --> 38:59.994
- Well, I'm just happy
to be here,

39:00.838 --> 39:03.548
Bringing your favourite food.
(chuckles)

39:04.509 --> 39:06.992
- Jack, why don't you grab
a plate and join us?

39:07.678 --> 39:09.837
- No, I... Really,
I should get going.

39:09.839 --> 39:11.765
- Jack, I insist.

39:15.036 --> 39:16.770
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

39:19.257 --> 39:22.984
- Well, all right, then.
I'll grab a plate.

39:25.780 --> 39:27.739
- Most of the emma texts are
sweet and funny.

39:27.741 --> 39:29.090
Some are kinda flirty.

39:29.092 --> 39:31.016
I get why taylor was
so taken with her.

39:31.018 --> 39:33.528
- Don't you have to turn
that computer over
to the police?

39:33.530 --> 39:36.431
- Maybe. But I'm not
helping them until they start

39:36.433 --> 39:37.690
Looking at an actual suspect

39:37.692 --> 39:40.377
Instead of building
a case against my son.

39:42.956 --> 39:44.288
What's that?

39:44.774 --> 39:46.749
- Found it in taylor's
locked drawer.

39:46.943 --> 39:48.176
It's a gift for emma.

39:49.011 --> 39:50.069
Should we give it to the police?

39:50.071 --> 39:52.555
- They'll just use it
against taylor.

39:55.059 --> 39:56.976
- Mom, you look beat.

39:56.978 --> 39:59.712
Maybe you should go upstairs.
Try and get some sleep.

39:59.714 --> 40:02.974
(sighs)
- I'm still too wired to sleep.

40:02.976 --> 40:05.910
- How about a long walk?
That always helps me.

40:06.246 --> 40:07.629
- That actually sounds
really nice.

40:07.631 --> 40:09.997
- Great. Give me a minute
and I'll check in with delaney

40:09.999 --> 40:11.533
And let her know what's up.

40:14.479 --> 40:16.913
- You know, I thought jack might
be shady when you told me

40:16.915 --> 40:18.706
About him snooping around
in your office,

40:18.708 --> 40:21.126
But I think he's crushing
on you, mom.

40:21.128 --> 40:23.244
(jack): Hey, sweetie. What?

40:23.246 --> 40:24.838
- No, I don't...

40:25.840 --> 40:27.515
Well, maybe just a little.

40:27.517 --> 40:29.091
- Yeah.

40:29.093 --> 40:30.051
(jack): Look.

40:33.381 --> 40:34.764
Are you kidding me?

40:35.958 --> 40:37.892
Honey, you've gotta use
your head.

40:38.828 --> 40:40.728
No.
(water rushes)

40:46.944 --> 40:48.319
- How's delaney?

40:49.697 --> 40:53.324
- It's just a constant flow of
rebellious teenage stuff
with her.

40:53.326 --> 40:55.117
Her suv got stolen last night,

40:55.119 --> 40:56.268
So I asked her to report it.

40:56.270 --> 40:58.938
Except one of her friends
finds it parked just outside

40:58.940 --> 41:00.331
The village green site
an hour ago,

41:00.333 --> 41:03.943
So she thinks it's fine
to just let it slide.

41:03.945 --> 41:06.545
(sighs)
I try not to let this stuff get

41:06.547 --> 41:09.174
Under my skin, but I really
should maybe start

41:09.176 --> 41:11.259
Meditating or something.

41:14.297 --> 41:15.638
I am so sorry.

41:15.640 --> 41:18.416
That is so ridiculous compared
to what you're dealing with.

41:18.418 --> 41:20.518
- No, it's okay. I get it.

41:28.236 --> 41:30.445
- You know, a walk always
does wonders for me.

41:30.447 --> 41:32.396
- Yeah, it's nice.
You're right.

41:32.398 --> 41:33.748
This is a good idea.

41:33.750 --> 41:35.808
- Fresh air just does something
to clear your mind.

41:35.810 --> 41:37.760
You know?
- Yeah. Yeah, I agree.

41:37.762 --> 41:40.145
- I really appreciate you.

41:40.147 --> 41:44.834
(ominous music)

42:17.077 --> 42:21.454
(♪♪)

42:25.544 --> 42:28.628
(camera clicks)

42:36.370 --> 42:38.513
(door creaking)

42:49.959 --> 42:54.612
(tense orchestral music)

43:09.570 --> 43:11.570
(dialling)

43:11.572 --> 43:13.172
(phone buzzes)

43:14.918 --> 43:15.800
(beeps off)

43:17.261 --> 43:18.486
(door closes in distance)

43:18.488 --> 43:21.264
(footsteps approaching)

43:25.586 --> 43:27.478
(gia shrieks)

43:27.480 --> 43:28.771
- Gia?!

43:28.773 --> 43:30.197
- Mom! I'm here!

43:30.199 --> 43:32.233
(panicked breathing)

43:32.235 --> 43:33.484
Gia!

43:35.346 --> 43:37.355
Oh, my god. Are you okay?!

43:37.357 --> 43:39.115
(gia): There's someone
in the house.

43:40.710 --> 43:42.768
- Stay here.
I'll get the lights.

43:42.770 --> 43:43.952
(phone beeps)

43:43.954 --> 43:45.663
Go, be careful.

43:51.838 --> 43:56.049
(♪♪)

44:07.069 --> 44:09.646
(grunts)

44:13.293 --> 44:15.151
- Get back here!
(grunts)

44:17.972 --> 44:19.230
You okay?

44:20.082 --> 44:23.325
- I'm okay. Are you good?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

44:23.327 --> 44:24.810
- I'm gonna check on gia.

44:24.812 --> 44:26.454
- Got his phone!

44:28.374 --> 44:30.040
(quick knocks)
- anybody home?

44:30.042 --> 44:32.151
Helen! I thought
I heard a scream.

44:32.153 --> 44:34.712
Is everything okay?
- It has been a crazy night.

44:34.714 --> 44:36.381
That reporter broke into
our house

44:36.383 --> 44:37.990
And gia was home alone.

44:37.992 --> 44:39.341
- Is she okay?

44:39.343 --> 44:41.101
- Yeah, she's fine,
but she is convinced that

44:41.103 --> 44:43.054
She saw somebody other
than the reporter

44:43.056 --> 44:44.588
In the house at the same time.

44:44.590 --> 44:47.166
She says she saw somebody go
into my office right before

44:47.168 --> 44:48.893
Seeing the reporter
in my kitchen.

44:49.503 --> 44:51.111
- Well, maybe the reporter went

44:51.113 --> 44:53.272
Into your office
to snoop around.

44:54.024 --> 44:55.007
- I don't know.

44:55.768 --> 44:58.360
- Did you call the police?
- Yeah, I just got off
the phone with them.

44:58.362 --> 45:01.589
They're gonna send somebody
in the morning to get
a description of the reporter,

45:01.591 --> 45:04.258
But honestly, I don't think
they care about us.

45:04.260 --> 45:06.077
We're just the murderer's
family.

45:06.079 --> 45:07.227
- Oh...

45:07.764 --> 45:09.080
Well, what happened to him?

45:09.766 --> 45:13.133
- Well, my friend jack was here.
He chased him outta the house.

45:13.135 --> 45:14.443
- Who's jack?

45:14.445 --> 45:16.461
- He works with me at kpl.

45:16.463 --> 45:18.556
He was here.
He brought dinner.

45:18.558 --> 45:19.674
- Oh.

45:20.877 --> 45:22.527
- Someone disconnected
and removed

45:22.529 --> 45:23.711
All your security cameras,
helen.

45:23.713 --> 45:25.287
It couldn't have been
that reporter.

45:25.289 --> 45:27.715
- God, gia was right. There was
somebody else in the house.

45:27.717 --> 45:30.852
- Mom, they took taylor's
gaming laptop.

45:30.854 --> 45:32.570
And emma's present, too.

45:32.572 --> 45:34.272
(sighs)
come on.

45:35.500 --> 45:39.736
(somber music)

45:51.832 --> 45:53.583
(phone buzzes)

45:59.740 --> 46:00.882
(dramatic boom)

46:16.924 --> 46:20.193
(birds chirping)

46:20.861 --> 46:21.903
Mom.

46:31.890 --> 46:33.122
(exhales)

46:35.042 --> 46:36.375
- I wish dad was here.

46:37.053 --> 46:40.046
I need him. And I miss him.

46:42.199 --> 46:43.591
- Me too.

46:45.160 --> 46:47.294
- It's funny, just when I think
I'm doing really great

46:47.296 --> 46:51.140
At this whole "adjusting to life
without him" thing,

46:51.801 --> 46:53.893
I just can't stop missing him.

46:55.522 --> 46:57.605
I don't think it's ever
gonna change.

46:58.791 --> 47:01.943
- It would be sad to me if
you did stop missing him.

47:03.813 --> 47:06.388
- He would be disappointed
in all this.

47:07.066 --> 47:11.510
It's a fail.
- Mom. Stop it. That's not true.

47:11.512 --> 47:13.988
- I failed to protect
our family.

47:13.990 --> 47:15.890
- No way have you failed.

47:16.376 --> 47:20.094
That's nuts. Mom, none of this
has anything to do with you.

47:20.096 --> 47:25.833
You're like the most amazing
mother and mentor and friend.

47:26.903 --> 47:30.162
And dad would be really proud of
your kickass parenting style.

47:30.773 --> 47:33.724
And all your success
at kpl to keep us going.

47:34.093 --> 47:36.260
(sighs)
- don't ever forget that.

47:36.962 --> 47:38.729
You constantly blow me away.

47:40.199 --> 47:42.607
- I love you for saying that,
but...

47:43.102 --> 47:45.902
We are basically prisoners
in our own home

47:45.904 --> 47:48.205
And taylor is in jail
for murder.

47:48.207 --> 47:50.324
- He didn't do it.
- I know that.

47:51.260 --> 47:53.135
- But... Like, you can't be

47:53.137 --> 47:56.038
Thinking this because...
It's taylor.

47:56.833 --> 47:58.182
Gamer geek.

47:58.609 --> 48:01.460
Science nerd.
He's not a killer.

48:04.140 --> 48:06.090
- I need to show you something.

48:10.371 --> 48:12.888
Look at the expression
on your brother's face.

48:12.890 --> 48:15.933
That is the exact same look
he had on it when

48:15.935 --> 48:18.227
The police were taking him out,
and I just...

48:19.272 --> 48:21.355
I can't get it out of my mind.
It's, it's like,

48:21.357 --> 48:24.575
I see that it's taylor,
but I feel like I'm looking at

48:24.577 --> 48:26.068
A complete stranger.

48:28.548 --> 48:30.914
- Taylor's been dealing
with a bully at school.

48:30.916 --> 48:32.174
(somber music)

48:32.176 --> 48:33.567
For the last few weeks.

48:33.569 --> 48:36.687
They were leaving these, like,
really creepy notes

48:36.689 --> 48:39.815
With these collages that were
taped to his coat
inside his locker.

48:39.817 --> 48:43.418
- No, wait, how did they
get into his locker?

48:43.420 --> 48:44.754
- No idea.

48:44.756 --> 48:46.172
But mom, in every one,

48:46.174 --> 48:48.925
They used all caps
and they called taylor a loser.

48:49.694 --> 48:51.068
- Why didn't he tell me?

48:51.070 --> 48:52.886
- I told him to tell you
a million times,

48:52.888 --> 48:56.106
But he didn't want you to be
worried about him

48:56.108 --> 48:59.060
In the middle of
your village green project.

49:00.480 --> 49:02.145
- Where are those notes?

49:02.147 --> 49:03.931
- I looked for them
all day in his desk.

49:03.933 --> 49:05.441
I couldn't find anything.

49:06.044 --> 49:07.434
Maybe he threw them away.

49:07.436 --> 49:10.604
- I hope not. This... This bully
could be the murderer.

49:10.606 --> 49:13.215
- Yeah. Maybe.

49:14.134 --> 49:17.019
And maybe it's a student
in taylor's chemistry class.

49:17.021 --> 49:21.040
That photo was taken in
mrs. Rennie's chemistry lab.

49:23.202 --> 49:25.335
- I really... I feel horrible

49:25.337 --> 49:27.063
Doubting your brother,
but there's just so much

49:27.065 --> 49:28.555
Pointing towards him.

49:28.557 --> 49:29.881
We really need to find something

49:29.883 --> 49:31.592
That points towards
someone else.

49:31.594 --> 49:32.927
- I agree.

49:34.964 --> 49:36.872
- I know that you said you were
gonna stay home today,

49:36.874 --> 49:40.600
But um, maybe you could just go
down to his chemistry class

49:40.602 --> 49:41.810
And talk to some of
the other students?

49:41.812 --> 49:44.463
- Yeah. I'm on it, mom.
- Okay, wait, wait. Just um...

49:44.465 --> 49:46.473
Just promise me that

49:46.475 --> 49:49.210
You are gonna be extra,
extra careful.

49:49.212 --> 49:50.319
- I promise.

49:56.326 --> 50:00.654
(door rattling)

50:01.257 --> 50:02.756
(delaney): No school today.

50:02.758 --> 50:05.042
The candlelight vigil
for sophia bliss will be held

50:05.044 --> 50:08.337
At city park tonight at 7:00.
I just found out myself.

50:09.565 --> 50:10.564
- Yeah.

50:10.991 --> 50:12.883
I don't know what
I was thinking.

50:15.329 --> 50:17.179
- Dad told me
what happened last night

50:17.181 --> 50:20.641
And I'm so sorry you
and your family are going
through this terrible nightmare.

50:21.911 --> 50:24.169
- You know, as hard
as this is for us,

50:24.855 --> 50:27.005
I can't even imagine what
sophia's family

50:27.007 --> 50:28.649
Is going through right now.

50:30.920 --> 50:32.527
Oh, it's just so sad.

50:33.030 --> 50:35.455
- The nonstop news is making it
seem like the police aren't

50:35.457 --> 50:38.075
Looking for any other suspects.
Is that true?

50:38.077 --> 50:39.868
- It's true for the police.

50:39.870 --> 50:41.295
But there is someone else.

50:41.297 --> 50:42.663
- Really? Who?

50:44.267 --> 50:46.584
- You're in taylor's
chemistry class, right?

50:46.586 --> 50:47.877
- I am.

50:49.213 --> 50:53.424
- Do you have any idea who
might've taken this photo?

50:55.886 --> 50:59.980
(chilling music)

50:59.982 --> 51:01.965
- No idea. Um, but I think

51:01.967 --> 51:04.785
There's a similar photo on
hadley high's swiftygram.

51:04.787 --> 51:05.811
Here.

51:08.457 --> 51:10.732
- Who is he?
- Lucas peters.

51:10.734 --> 51:12.318
He's a colossal jerk.

51:14.964 --> 51:17.531
- Come with me.
I think I have a plan.

51:20.269 --> 51:23.329
(birds chirping)

51:28.252 --> 51:30.494
- Helen.
- Good morning.

51:30.496 --> 51:32.963
- Oh... Did you get any sleep?

51:33.633 --> 51:35.808
- To be honest, I was still
a little rattled.

51:35.810 --> 51:38.936
- Oh. If you're ever nervous,
you can call me.

51:38.938 --> 51:42.723
I can always camp out on
your couch and I'll bring miles.

51:43.459 --> 51:44.517
- Thank you.

51:45.645 --> 51:47.602
- Uh, this is a, uh...

51:47.604 --> 51:51.148
A gift from miles to taylor.

51:51.150 --> 51:52.516
- That's really kind.

51:53.151 --> 51:54.318
- It's got some puzzle books

51:54.320 --> 51:57.363
And a couple of taylor's
favourite candy bars.

51:57.931 --> 51:59.156
Will they allow it?

51:59.158 --> 52:02.575
- Unfortunately not, but I'll
keep it at home for him. Yes.

52:02.577 --> 52:04.044
He'll really appreciate this.

52:04.046 --> 52:06.205
You know how much
he looks up to miles.

52:09.051 --> 52:10.417
Is everything okay?

52:11.337 --> 52:12.961
- Oh, no big deal,

52:12.963 --> 52:15.339
Just my whole life is
falling apart.

52:16.484 --> 52:17.550
I'm sorry, I...

52:17.552 --> 52:19.376
I shouldn't have said that.
I know that it's nothing

52:19.378 --> 52:21.595
Compared to what
you're going through.

52:22.982 --> 52:24.181
- What's going on?

52:24.800 --> 52:26.308
- It's um...

52:28.271 --> 52:32.439
Miles continues
to struggle in school.

52:33.717 --> 52:36.627
His physics teacher e-mailed me
this morning to say that

52:36.629 --> 52:39.804
He failed his midterm yesterday.

52:40.399 --> 52:42.733
(sighs)
I'm worried about
his scholarship.

52:43.344 --> 52:47.687
And on top of that, my app,
it's, it's just not getting
the downloads that it needs.

52:48.665 --> 52:51.058
Honestly, I don't know what
I'm gonna do if it fails.

52:51.060 --> 52:52.817
- Hey, just keep the faith.

52:52.819 --> 52:54.486
I'm sure everything will,
you know,

52:54.488 --> 52:56.413
Turn around with work
and with miles.

52:56.415 --> 52:58.215
- I don't really think that
I can smile

52:58.217 --> 52:59.925
My way through this one.

53:00.961 --> 53:03.846
- I didn't say that.
- I know, I'm sorry. I...

53:04.657 --> 53:07.207
I'm uh, in a terrible,
horrible mood

53:07.209 --> 53:11.428
And the last person
I wanna hurt is you.

53:11.430 --> 53:15.691
(suspenseful music)

53:16.677 --> 53:17.943
- We're good.

53:29.298 --> 53:30.705
- Which one is it?

53:30.707 --> 53:33.667
- Um, I think it's just
the one over there.

53:36.705 --> 53:38.005
It's that one.

53:39.132 --> 53:40.925
(lock rattles)

53:44.054 --> 53:44.962
(scoffs)

53:44.964 --> 53:46.538
Think this is lucas's locker?

53:47.116 --> 53:50.017
- That collage looks a lot
like the notes taylor got.

53:53.898 --> 53:55.314
- What are you looking for?

53:56.008 --> 53:57.608
- Not really sure.

54:02.298 --> 54:03.656
It's him.

54:04.659 --> 54:06.033
- My god.

54:14.418 --> 54:16.168
(camera clicks)

54:20.633 --> 54:22.466
- Why would he leave
his phone in here?

54:22.468 --> 54:24.176
- Because that's a burner phone.

54:24.737 --> 54:25.903
(clunking in distance)

54:26.572 --> 54:29.306
(whispers): Someone's coming.
Put it back!

54:31.026 --> 54:35.454
- Maybe part of it is
the pressure of being
a single parent, you know?

54:36.148 --> 54:38.582
I know all parents struggle
to keep their kids on the rails

54:38.584 --> 54:40.442
Until they're out on
their own, but...

54:41.870 --> 54:45.114
Some of us struggle
a lot more than others. Right?

54:47.651 --> 54:49.276
And I just worry that...

54:50.045 --> 54:52.462
(sighs)
what if miles never achieves

54:52.464 --> 54:56.125
Anything beyond his high school
sports trophies?

54:57.503 --> 54:59.694
I really thought that this app

54:59.696 --> 55:02.147
Would be successful
and inspire him, and...

55:02.149 --> 55:04.425
You know, it would be something
that I could leave him.

55:04.427 --> 55:07.635
- You do not have to worry
about that right now.

55:08.364 --> 55:11.890
Miles is an amazing person.
He has so many great qualities.

55:12.568 --> 55:14.268
I'm sure he'll figure it out.

55:15.871 --> 55:17.521
- I hope you're right.

55:18.499 --> 55:20.691
- Hey, it'll be okay.

55:22.327 --> 55:24.653
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

55:25.314 --> 55:26.655
I gotta run.

55:33.405 --> 55:35.331
(alarm buzzes)

55:41.613 --> 55:42.838
Taylor.

55:58.581 --> 56:00.080
- How'd you find them?

56:00.082 --> 56:02.682
- You've been leaving things in
your father's fishing box

56:02.684 --> 56:03.934
Since you were five years old.

56:03.936 --> 56:05.903
A mom knows these things.

56:08.907 --> 56:11.742
Whoever left these notes
for taylor and sent me
the text messages

56:11.744 --> 56:13.852
Could be the same person
who broke into your house,

56:13.854 --> 56:17.331
Destroyed our security
cameras, stole his laptop.

56:18.024 --> 56:19.557
Why would they do any of it

56:19.559 --> 56:21.293
Unless they were
the real killer?

56:24.806 --> 56:27.716
- This is from
the city park webcam.

56:28.827 --> 56:29.718
(beeps)

56:29.720 --> 56:34.306
(tense music)

56:50.098 --> 56:51.281
(dramatic boom)

56:56.913 --> 57:00.006
You had told me and you had told
the hadley police department

57:00.008 --> 57:01.232
That on the night of the murder,

57:01.234 --> 57:02.793
You and sophia went
your separate ways,

57:02.795 --> 57:05.236
But this contradicts your sworn
statement, taylor.

57:05.238 --> 57:07.080
And sophia's body was found
10 feet away from

57:07.082 --> 57:08.490
Where you two were
last seen together.

57:08.492 --> 57:10.050
(shouting): We split up
right after that!

57:10.052 --> 57:11.859
- This doesn't prove anything.

57:11.861 --> 57:13.261
- Taylor's very angry
in this video.

57:13.263 --> 57:14.588
- I didn't do it!
- Taylor.

57:14.590 --> 57:16.640
(shouting): It wasn't me!
I didn't do it!

57:16.642 --> 57:19.025
I would never hurt sophia!
I didn't do it!
- Taylor.

57:19.027 --> 57:21.161
- Mom!
- Don't hurt him, please.
- I didn't do it, mom!

57:21.163 --> 57:23.096
This wasn't me!
(helen): Please don't hurt him!

57:23.098 --> 57:24.398
- It wasn't me!

57:27.928 --> 57:29.536
- Bully is lucas peters.

57:29.538 --> 57:31.772
And he had a huge crush
on sophia bliss.

57:31.774 --> 57:34.090
- How do you know his name?
- Long story.

57:34.092 --> 57:36.951
Jack's daughter, delaney,
helped me break into
lucas's locker.

57:36.953 --> 57:38.178
We found a burner phone.

57:38.180 --> 57:41.047
- You broke into his locker?
Are you crazy?

57:41.049 --> 57:41.974
- Nobody knew it was us.

57:41.976 --> 57:43.667
- Did anybody see you?
- No, no.

57:43.669 --> 57:46.336
We got away and delaney left
an anonymous tip

57:46.338 --> 57:47.671
For the police
to search lucas's locker.

57:47.673 --> 57:51.024
(sighs)
- can you send me a text
of that and a photo?

57:51.026 --> 57:52.301
- Sure.

57:54.162 --> 57:55.328
You okay, mom?

57:56.306 --> 57:58.540
- The police have webcam footage
of taylor at the park

57:58.542 --> 58:00.642
With sophia and he looks
really angry.

58:00.644 --> 58:03.127
- I don't care.
I know he didn't kill her.

58:03.129 --> 58:05.189
(phone rings)

58:07.634 --> 58:09.193
- Hello, this is helen.

58:10.062 --> 58:12.488
Of course.
I'm coming right now.

58:13.974 --> 58:15.640
I have to go to the office.
- What?

58:15.642 --> 58:17.884
- Lock the doors.
I should be about an hour.

58:18.203 --> 58:22.206
(indistinct chatter)
(office phone ringing)

58:42.536 --> 58:44.102
(elevator dings)

59:02.723 --> 59:04.097
What's going on?

59:04.099 --> 59:06.917
- I'm uh, leaving kpl.

59:06.919 --> 59:09.043
Hanging my own shingle.

59:09.045 --> 59:10.937
Yeah, I've always wanted
my own business,

59:10.939 --> 59:13.448
But I never had a project
big enough to carry it.

59:13.450 --> 59:16.443
- Ah. Barnes investments
decides they can't work

59:16.445 --> 59:18.202
With kpl anymore because of all
the bad press

59:18.204 --> 59:19.887
About me and taylor,
and you use it

59:19.889 --> 59:22.299
As your golden opportunity to
take the village green project.

59:22.301 --> 59:24.375
- Kpl gave me their blessing,

59:24.377 --> 59:26.286
And I told kpl
I'd bring them back in

59:26.288 --> 59:28.154
After all
this craziness blew over.

59:28.156 --> 59:29.547
It's win-win.

59:30.276 --> 59:34.227
Hey, I'm not the bad guy here.
- I never said that you were.

59:35.055 --> 59:38.115
This is one of the worst
days of my entire life.

59:38.650 --> 59:41.535
Losing the village green
project and my job.

59:44.064 --> 59:45.289
Best of luck.

59:48.585 --> 59:49.960
(crying)

01:00:02.390 --> 01:00:04.057
(sniffling)

01:00:16.846 --> 01:00:19.756
I can't talk right now.
- I'm really sorry

01:00:19.758 --> 01:00:21.207
About everything.

01:00:21.209 --> 01:00:23.701
And I just... I hope
this doesn't impact

01:00:23.703 --> 01:00:24.761
Our new friendship.

01:00:24.763 --> 01:00:26.054
- Look, I don't know what
you've made up

01:00:26.056 --> 01:00:28.773
In your head about us,
but we barely know each other.

01:00:28.775 --> 01:00:30.709
(phone rings)

01:00:31.545 --> 01:00:33.128
I have to take this.

01:00:39.594 --> 01:00:40.618
Susan.

01:00:41.121 --> 01:00:42.804
I know the identity of
the bully.

01:00:42.806 --> 01:00:44.364
His name is lucas peters.

01:00:44.366 --> 01:00:46.124
And he had a crush
on sophia bliss.

01:00:46.126 --> 01:00:48.209
<i> - I'll pass his name along</i>
<i> to the hadley police.</i>

01:00:48.211 --> 01:00:51.488
<i>We need to meet to put together</i>
<i>our plan for taylor's defence.</i>

01:00:51.490 --> 01:00:56.526
(sinister music)

01:00:57.137 --> 01:01:00.238
- Can you send me the city
park webcam video?

01:01:01.433 --> 01:01:03.007
<i> - Okay, helen.</i>

01:01:03.009 --> 01:01:04.159
- Thanks.

01:01:07.839 --> 01:01:09.623
I need to show you something.

01:01:11.493 --> 01:01:13.335
- That's delaney's suv.

01:01:16.331 --> 01:01:17.964
(phone buzzes)

01:01:21.678 --> 01:01:22.910
(dramatic boom)

01:01:22.912 --> 01:01:26.589
(chilling music)

01:01:26.591 --> 01:01:28.016
(phone buzzes)

01:01:28.760 --> 01:01:29.810
- I need a minute.

01:01:31.045 --> 01:01:32.062
- Mom.

01:01:34.199 --> 01:01:37.818
(indistinct chatter)

01:01:50.124 --> 01:01:53.750
(crying)

01:02:08.291 --> 01:02:09.433
- Miles!

01:02:12.487 --> 01:02:16.356
(suspenseful music)

01:02:23.389 --> 01:02:25.115
No, just get in.

01:02:36.828 --> 01:02:38.295
(helen): Someone thinks
we know something.

01:02:38.297 --> 01:02:39.420
(camera shutter snaps)

01:02:39.422 --> 01:02:40.589
- Lucas peters?

01:02:41.074 --> 01:02:41.998
- Maybe.

01:02:42.592 --> 01:02:45.719
- We don't have our security
cameras to prove it's him.

01:02:47.322 --> 01:02:49.689
- Who would do such
a horrible thing?

01:02:49.691 --> 01:02:50.581
- We don't know.

01:02:51.009 --> 01:02:53.751
At least a couple of coats of
paint should cover that up.

01:02:54.104 --> 01:02:56.438
- Well, sign me up
for the paint crew.

01:02:57.332 --> 01:02:58.523
- I will.

01:03:00.093 --> 01:03:02.035
- Now, why don't you grab
an overnight bag

01:03:02.037 --> 01:03:03.295
And come stay with us?

01:03:03.297 --> 01:03:06.490
You two, me and miles,
pat's pizza.

01:03:06.492 --> 01:03:07.657
- That'd be great.

01:03:08.043 --> 01:03:09.709
Gia, you go ahead with judy.
(camera shutter snaps)

01:03:09.711 --> 01:03:11.861
I'll pack the bag.
- You sure?

01:03:11.863 --> 01:03:15.040
- Yeah. I have to call taylor's
lawyer and update her.

01:03:16.685 --> 01:03:17.542
- Come.

01:03:22.057 --> 01:03:24.591
(bird cawing in distance)

01:03:26.737 --> 01:03:29.513
- I don't understand.
You said that you weren't
in love with her!

01:03:29.515 --> 01:03:31.181
- Listen, look,
you don't understand.

01:03:31.183 --> 01:03:33.307
This has nothing to do
with you or with us.

01:03:33.309 --> 01:03:35.385
I just need you
to trust me on this.

01:03:35.387 --> 01:03:37.637
- I--
okay? Please, we had
something in the past.

01:03:37.639 --> 01:03:39.772
And it means nothing anymore!
It doesn't, delaney!

01:03:39.774 --> 01:03:41.975
It does not mean anything
anymore!
- It means everything!

01:03:41.977 --> 01:03:43.693
You told me that you weren't
in love with her!

01:03:43.695 --> 01:03:44.927
- It has nothing to do with you

01:03:44.929 --> 01:03:46.546
Or with us, okay?!
You just don't understand!

01:03:46.548 --> 01:03:48.147
- Where are you going?!

01:03:48.149 --> 01:03:49.449
- I just...

01:04:04.249 --> 01:04:06.699
- So, miles, how well
do you know delaney?

01:04:06.701 --> 01:04:09.010
I mean, you two are friends,
right?

01:04:10.005 --> 01:04:11.254
- Um...

01:04:11.915 --> 01:04:13.623
We're like, we're like
new friends.

01:04:13.625 --> 01:04:16.426
Like, we haven't really hung out
a lot, so...

01:04:16.428 --> 01:04:18.428
Don't really know her too well.

01:04:18.838 --> 01:04:20.446
- Who is delaney?

01:04:20.448 --> 01:04:21.948
- She's just a friend
from school.

01:04:22.267 --> 01:04:25.360
- Hmm.
- Did delaney know sophia bliss?

01:04:27.105 --> 01:04:29.239
- I, I... She went to
her birthday party,

01:04:29.241 --> 01:04:31.532
But I don't think she, like,
you know, really knew her.

01:04:31.534 --> 01:04:33.535
- And they have chemistry
class together.

01:04:34.746 --> 01:04:37.113
- Yeah, but that, that doesn't
really make them friends,
though.

01:04:37.115 --> 01:04:40.667
- No. I don't think delaney
knows anyone that well yet.

01:04:42.421 --> 01:04:44.087
- Yeah, yeah. She was um...

01:04:44.089 --> 01:04:45.972
Telling me, you know, that
it's hard for her

01:04:45.974 --> 01:04:47.440
To make friends 'cause um,

01:04:47.442 --> 01:04:49.142
You know, her and her dad move
around a lot.

01:04:49.144 --> 01:04:51.961
So, it's... It's tough on her.

01:04:51.963 --> 01:04:53.763
- Wonder why they move
around so much?

01:04:54.974 --> 01:04:56.141
- I don't know.

01:04:56.709 --> 01:04:57.976
- Do you know this girl?

01:04:59.204 --> 01:05:00.711
- Jack is delaney's dad.

01:05:00.713 --> 01:05:02.463
You met him at our house?

01:05:02.465 --> 01:05:04.257
- Oh yeah.
- But uh...

01:05:04.259 --> 01:05:05.733
Why all the questions
about delaney?

01:05:05.735 --> 01:05:07.902
I mean, she's not...
She's not in trouble, right?

01:05:07.904 --> 01:05:09.996
- Her suv was parked across--
- oh.

01:05:09.998 --> 01:05:12.265
We can't talk about that.
- Oh, sorry.

01:05:12.267 --> 01:05:16.152
- Sorry, you guys, it's just
some stuff from taylor's lawyer.

01:05:16.622 --> 01:05:18.062
We're not allowed to share,

01:05:18.064 --> 01:05:20.248
So let's just forget it.

01:05:22.510 --> 01:05:25.178
- Well, it's all just so tragic.

01:05:25.180 --> 01:05:27.246
I still can't believe
sophia's gone.

01:05:27.248 --> 01:05:28.665
She was such a lovely,
young woman.

01:05:28.667 --> 01:05:31.467
- They're having a candlelight
vigil for her tonight.

01:05:31.469 --> 01:05:32.752
- Are you two going?

01:05:33.387 --> 01:05:35.354
- I'd like to go, but I don't...

01:05:35.356 --> 01:05:37.490
I don't think it's a good idea
for me to show up.

01:05:37.492 --> 01:05:38.933
(judy): Oh. Of course.

01:05:38.935 --> 01:05:40.018
Are you going?

01:05:41.513 --> 01:05:42.520
- Um...

01:05:43.348 --> 01:05:44.697
I have some ap french homework

01:05:44.699 --> 01:05:46.291
That I gotta finish, so um...

01:05:46.785 --> 01:05:48.485
Goodnight, you guys.
- Mm.

01:05:52.966 --> 01:05:54.056
(scoffs)

01:05:54.058 --> 01:05:55.708
- Didn't miles go on
a couple dates

01:05:55.710 --> 01:05:56.968
With sophia last summer?

01:05:56.970 --> 01:06:00.580
- Mmm, he did, but he had
his eye on someone else

01:06:00.582 --> 01:06:02.374
And moved on pretty quickly.

01:06:09.816 --> 01:06:12.734
- Why would judy pretend
not to know delaney?

01:06:13.386 --> 01:06:15.445
- Maybe she really doesn't
know her.

01:06:15.447 --> 01:06:16.888
Did she say her name?

01:06:18.033 --> 01:06:19.248
- No.

01:06:19.250 --> 01:06:20.717
- She probably just thinks
it was some random

01:06:20.719 --> 01:06:22.060
Giving miles a ride.

01:06:22.821 --> 01:06:23.937
- Maybe.

01:06:27.292 --> 01:06:29.042
- I don't think miles
got over sophia

01:06:29.044 --> 01:06:31.144
As fast as
his mom said he did.

01:06:31.146 --> 01:06:33.213
What if he was still
in love with her,

01:06:33.748 --> 01:06:36.733
And delaney knew
and was insanely jealous?

01:06:36.735 --> 01:06:38.659
Or what if jack's in on it too,

01:06:38.661 --> 01:06:40.311
And the two of them,
they set up taylor so that

01:06:40.313 --> 01:06:42.413
He could take over
your village green project?

01:06:42.415 --> 01:06:43.923
- Miles said they were
just friends.

01:06:43.925 --> 01:06:48.336
- No. They were
together-together at
sophia's party.

01:06:52.917 --> 01:06:54.083
(sighs)

01:06:54.085 --> 01:06:56.177
- It's a bit of a reach,
don't you think?

01:06:59.449 --> 01:07:00.590
Gia, what is it?

01:07:01.292 --> 01:07:03.201
- I asked delaney
who took this photo.

01:07:03.203 --> 01:07:06.429
And she said she didn't know,
but mom, she took it.

01:07:06.431 --> 01:07:07.563
Why would she lie to me?

01:07:08.016 --> 01:07:11.525
- That is so strange.
- Do you think we should
at least call the police?

01:07:11.527 --> 01:07:12.676
- And tell them what?

01:07:12.678 --> 01:07:14.278
This is all just
a crazy speculation.

01:07:14.280 --> 01:07:15.596
- She lied about the photo!

01:07:15.598 --> 01:07:16.740
- We need real evidence.

01:07:17.183 --> 01:07:18.616
- You don't think
delaney did it, do you?

01:07:18.618 --> 01:07:21.018
- I just... I have such a hard
time thinking such a bright,

01:07:21.020 --> 01:07:23.104
Young woman could do
something so awful.

01:07:23.106 --> 01:07:25.682
- Do you think
it was lucas peters?
- Oh...

01:07:25.684 --> 01:07:28.001
I don't know who to trust
at this point.

01:07:28.711 --> 01:07:31.296
Look, I want you to take this,
put it in your bag.

01:07:31.298 --> 01:07:34.507
Take it everywhere with you
and do not hesitate to use it.

01:07:35.026 --> 01:07:35.875
- Okay.

01:07:35.877 --> 01:07:38.053
- I just want you to be safe.

01:07:42.975 --> 01:07:47.771
(mournful music)

01:07:55.063 --> 01:07:56.404
(blows)

01:08:07.959 --> 01:08:09.125
(distant crack)

01:08:11.922 --> 01:08:17.841
(tense music)

01:08:36.104 --> 01:08:37.611
- Helen? Helen, wake up.

01:08:37.613 --> 01:08:40.038
- Judy? Judy, what's wrong?
Is it taylor?

01:08:40.041 --> 01:08:41.341
- No, taylor's fine.

01:08:41.343 --> 01:08:43.434
Helen, lucas peters is missing.

01:08:43.862 --> 01:08:46.496
It's all over the news.
They say that he left a note

01:08:46.497 --> 01:08:47.863
Confessing to sophia's murder

01:08:47.866 --> 01:08:50.124
And then jumped off
the hadley bridge.

01:08:50.502 --> 01:08:52.535
The police are searching
the river now.

01:08:52.537 --> 01:08:54.087
(sighs)
- oh, my god.

01:08:54.840 --> 01:08:56.005
Okay.

01:09:03.590 --> 01:09:05.765
- Any comment on lucas peters,
mrs. Parker?

01:09:08.352 --> 01:09:09.535
No comment?

01:09:09.895 --> 01:09:12.196
Will your son be released today?

01:09:12.198 --> 01:09:13.648
- No comment.

01:09:14.417 --> 01:09:16.151
- This is beyond sad.

01:09:16.711 --> 01:09:17.810
I feel sick.

01:09:17.812 --> 01:09:19.612
(phone buzzes)

01:09:21.432 --> 01:09:23.232
(doorbell dings)

01:09:23.234 --> 01:09:25.468
- Taylor's lawyer wants me
to call her.

01:09:25.470 --> 01:09:27.144
- It's probably about
getting him out.

01:09:27.145 --> 01:09:28.754
- I don't think so.

01:09:28.756 --> 01:09:30.790
(outgoing ringtone)

01:09:33.077 --> 01:09:35.752
<i> (susan): We don't know yet if</i>
<i> lucas killed sophia bliss.</i>

01:09:35.755 --> 01:09:36.895
(doorbell dings)

01:09:36.898 --> 01:09:37.913
(pounding on door)
- what?

01:09:37.916 --> 01:09:39.215
<i> - Lucas's family claimed that</i>

01:09:39.216 --> 01:09:41.067
<i> He was away with his family</i>
<i> last weekend.</i>

01:09:41.069 --> 01:09:44.545
Also, the police believes
that someone killed lucas.

01:09:44.546 --> 01:09:45.821
Made it look like a suicide,

01:09:45.823 --> 01:09:48.307
<i> Created that concussion</i>
<i>to blame sophia's death on him,</i>

01:09:48.309 --> 01:09:50.542
<i> So they're looking</i>
<i> into multiple suspects.</i>

01:09:50.544 --> 01:09:51.844
- Do they think it was me?

01:09:51.845 --> 01:09:55.565
- No, but your daughter,
gia, is one of the suspects.

01:09:58.670 --> 01:10:00.695
(loud knocking on door)

01:10:04.375 --> 01:10:06.242
- Mrs. Parker.
(dramatic boom)

01:10:11.899 --> 01:10:13.891
(judy): We ate pizza
and went to bed.

01:10:13.893 --> 01:10:15.418
Nobody left the house.

01:10:16.021 --> 01:10:17.270
- How can you be so sure?

01:10:17.272 --> 01:10:18.588
- I'm a very light sleeper.

01:10:18.590 --> 01:10:21.624
If anyone had left the house,
I would've heard them.

01:10:21.626 --> 01:10:24.944
(pensive music)

01:10:24.946 --> 01:10:26.387
- Okay, thank you.

01:10:26.389 --> 01:10:27.947
This has been very helpful.

01:10:27.949 --> 01:10:29.556
Sorry for all the questions.

01:10:29.558 --> 01:10:33.152
But only a handful of people
knew about the collage messages,

01:10:33.154 --> 01:10:36.289
And we had an anonymous tip that

01:10:36.291 --> 01:10:39.650
Gia had broken into
lucas peters's locker yesterday.

01:10:39.652 --> 01:10:42.153
- Does this mean taylor
won't be released today?

01:10:43.314 --> 01:10:45.906
- Unless we have another suspect
in custody

01:10:45.908 --> 01:10:47.891
Or you find evidence
to clear him,

01:10:47.893 --> 01:10:50.411
Your son will remain
at the detention centre.

01:10:59.005 --> 01:11:01.172
(school bell rings)

01:11:03.134 --> 01:11:05.409
- Delaney!
(delaney): Hey!

01:11:05.411 --> 01:11:09.288
(tense music)

01:11:09.290 --> 01:11:13.100
- I know what you did.
I know what you and your dad
did to sophia and to lucas

01:11:13.102 --> 01:11:14.510
And you're not gonna
get away with it.

01:11:15.179 --> 01:11:17.179
- What, you're not even gonna
defend yourself?!

01:11:17.181 --> 01:11:18.730
You two are a bunch of killers!

01:11:18.732 --> 01:11:20.666
- We didn't do anything.
My dad isn't involved--

01:11:20.668 --> 01:11:22.502
- You're lying!
I know you did this!

01:11:22.504 --> 01:11:24.320
My brother is in jail!

01:11:24.322 --> 01:11:26.489
How could you do this to him?!

01:11:26.491 --> 01:11:28.157
Stop lying!

01:11:28.676 --> 01:11:30.868
Get off me! Get off!

01:11:33.272 --> 01:11:35.498
(whirring)

01:11:54.436 --> 01:11:55.977
- His truck.

01:11:59.733 --> 01:12:04.027
(pivotal music)

01:12:12.720 --> 01:12:14.996
(dialling)

01:12:19.594 --> 01:12:21.711
<i> (jack): I am so sorry.</i>
<i> I... I didn't handle</i>

01:12:21.713 --> 01:12:23.262
<i>Any of the kpl transition well.</i>

01:12:23.264 --> 01:12:26.248
- Jack, can you come over
right now? I need your help.

01:12:26.250 --> 01:12:27.925
<i> - I'm on my way.</i>

01:12:32.248 --> 01:12:35.749
- This is miles's burner phone.
- Delaney...

01:12:35.751 --> 01:12:38.094
- He used it to send taylor
the emma texts.

01:12:38.096 --> 01:12:40.838
- You're lying!
- Gia, stop.

01:12:40.840 --> 01:12:45.117
(tense music)

01:12:45.119 --> 01:12:46.361
- Tell her, miles.

01:12:47.513 --> 01:12:48.946
- It's not what you think.

01:12:51.242 --> 01:12:53.033
I made up emma because
I wanted taylor

01:12:53.035 --> 01:12:54.610
To feel better about himself.
I...

01:12:54.612 --> 01:12:56.596
Look, I know how wrong
that is now.

01:12:56.598 --> 01:12:57.747
It's just...

01:12:57.749 --> 01:12:59.098
Look, I was worried
about him.

01:12:59.100 --> 01:13:00.583
'cause he's always getting
bullied and I thought

01:13:00.585 --> 01:13:01.867
This was gonna
help him somehow. I thought...

01:13:01.869 --> 01:13:03.552
I thought this would help!
- And...

01:13:03.554 --> 01:13:04.754
I saw how awkward

01:13:04.756 --> 01:13:07.957
Taylor was at school.
And I felt bad for him.

01:13:08.884 --> 01:13:11.977
So, I kept the burner phone
and I wrote some of the texts

01:13:11.979 --> 01:13:14.138
So that emma would sound
more authentic.

01:13:14.815 --> 01:13:15.765
And...

01:13:16.768 --> 01:13:18.651
Honestly, I just did it

01:13:18.653 --> 01:13:20.803
'cause I really wanted miles
to like me.

01:13:20.805 --> 01:13:23.230
- You're both disgusting.

01:13:23.232 --> 01:13:25.391
(♪♪)

01:13:25.393 --> 01:13:27.150
Did you kill sophia?

01:13:27.152 --> 01:13:29.862
- No! I was at the party
with you.

01:13:32.650 --> 01:13:34.117
- Miles?

01:13:36.254 --> 01:13:37.303
(thud)

01:13:37.663 --> 01:13:43.251
(threatening music)

01:13:49.767 --> 01:13:52.268
(helen): First of all,
I apologize for everything

01:13:52.270 --> 01:13:54.520
That I said yesterday.
- Really? I--

01:13:54.522 --> 01:13:56.263
- Can I just finish?

01:13:56.265 --> 01:13:58.081
I completely understand
what you did.

01:13:58.083 --> 01:14:00.476
If you hadn't jumped in,
the entire village green site

01:14:00.478 --> 01:14:01.811
Could've been shut down.

01:14:02.313 --> 01:14:05.022
I would've done the exact
same thing for my family.

01:14:06.200 --> 01:14:09.092
- Wow, um... Thank you.
(soft chuckle)

01:14:09.094 --> 01:14:10.686
- Does that mean
you accept my apology?

01:14:10.688 --> 01:14:12.538
- Yes, of course, I do.

01:14:12.540 --> 01:14:14.281
Apology accepted.

01:14:14.283 --> 01:14:15.174
- Great.

01:14:15.176 --> 01:14:17.784
So, after a couple nights of
no sleep,

01:14:17.786 --> 01:14:19.878
I finally slept last night
and when I woke up and heard

01:14:19.880 --> 01:14:23.215
The sad news about lucas,
something hit me.

01:14:23.217 --> 01:14:26.002
I think I can clear taylor,
but I need some help.

01:14:26.004 --> 01:14:28.537
- Okay. I have no idea
what you're talking about.

01:14:28.539 --> 01:14:30.523
Just let me know what I can do.

01:14:30.525 --> 01:14:32.282
- But I remember you
saying that

01:14:32.284 --> 01:14:34.785
Delaney's suv was stolen
the night of sophia's murder,

01:14:34.787 --> 01:14:36.895
And it was left by
the village green site?

01:14:36.897 --> 01:14:38.364
- Yeah, we picked it up there.

01:14:38.366 --> 01:14:40.199
- Okay. Could you go down
to the site

01:14:40.201 --> 01:14:42.368
And check the security
footage for me?

01:14:42.370 --> 01:14:43.886
- Yeah, of course.
- Okay.

01:14:43.888 --> 01:14:46.055
Do you have
the key card, uh, passcode?

01:14:46.057 --> 01:14:48.040
- Kpl sent me everything
last night.

01:14:48.042 --> 01:14:49.150
- Okay.

01:14:50.319 --> 01:14:51.652
(deep exhale)

01:14:54.657 --> 01:14:55.948
(door closes)

01:15:04.408 --> 01:15:06.225
Hey!
- Hi.

01:15:06.819 --> 01:15:09.729
How are you holding up?
- I'm a little jumpy.

01:15:09.731 --> 01:15:10.730
(chuckles)

01:15:11.082 --> 01:15:12.839
- Any more news from the police?

01:15:12.841 --> 01:15:16.219
- No, but I... I think
I might be able to clear taylor.

01:15:17.555 --> 01:15:19.004
- Uh, what do you mean?

01:15:19.006 --> 01:15:20.339
- Well, it's a long story,

01:15:20.341 --> 01:15:23.576
But I think that sophia's killer
was driving delaney's suv,

01:15:23.578 --> 01:15:25.168
Which was stolen
the night of her murder.

01:15:25.170 --> 01:15:27.522
And they left it by
the village green site.

01:15:28.750 --> 01:15:30.416
- How would that clear taylor?

01:15:30.418 --> 01:15:33.010
- Because there are
several security cameras

01:15:33.012 --> 01:15:34.270
In the site's trailer.

01:15:34.272 --> 01:15:37.106
I just sent my friend jack down
to check the video footage.

01:15:37.108 --> 01:15:40.793
If I can tell the police who was
driving that suv,

01:15:40.795 --> 01:15:42.954
They might have the real killer.

01:15:42.956 --> 01:15:44.305
- I need you to understand,

01:15:44.307 --> 01:15:45.798
I never meant to get
taylor into trouble.

01:15:45.800 --> 01:15:47.783
- What are you talking about?
- I need you to understand--

01:15:47.785 --> 01:15:49.585
- You didn't kill sophia!
You didn't!

01:15:49.587 --> 01:15:52.212
I know you didn't!
- Look, gia, it was my fault.

01:15:52.214 --> 01:15:54.139
It... No, gia!
I'm not a murderer.

01:15:54.141 --> 01:15:55.490
I swear to you.
I... No, I didn't,

01:15:55.492 --> 01:15:57.384
I didn't murder anybody, okay?!
I--

01:15:57.386 --> 01:16:00.796
(party music)
(cheering)

01:16:00.798 --> 01:16:01.931
I loved her.

01:16:02.784 --> 01:16:04.391
I still do. It's just...

01:16:04.393 --> 01:16:06.911
Look, I just wanted
to talk to her!

01:16:06.913 --> 01:16:09.396
Alone! That's all I wanted!

01:16:09.398 --> 01:16:10.714
And I wanted to see if maybe
we could

01:16:10.716 --> 01:16:12.441
Get back together again,
but I...

01:16:12.443 --> 01:16:14.584
I was afraid she would say no.

01:16:14.586 --> 01:16:16.445
And I knew she wouldn't
wanna talk to me!

01:16:18.098 --> 01:16:19.824
So, I sent her this message
as this guy

01:16:19.826 --> 01:16:22.167
That I knew she liked
and I just thought to ask her

01:16:22.169 --> 01:16:25.913
To come to the park to meet me
and... She said yes.

01:16:26.890 --> 01:16:28.407
So, that's why I took
delaney's car,

01:16:28.409 --> 01:16:29.709
And I was gonna go...

01:16:31.004 --> 01:16:33.528
Then I remembered, what if
she doesn't...

01:16:33.530 --> 01:16:35.097
What if she just leaves
when she sees me?

01:16:35.099 --> 01:16:36.874
So, that's why I...
I messaged taylor,

01:16:36.876 --> 01:16:38.241
'cause I know that
she trusts him,

01:16:38.243 --> 01:16:40.419
And I thought, "I'll just send
him one more message as emma."

01:16:40.421 --> 01:16:42.179
(message chimes)
just one last time

01:16:42.181 --> 01:16:43.514
So I could get him there.

01:16:43.516 --> 01:16:45.098
So he could help me.

01:16:45.100 --> 01:16:46.392
And I made my way there.

01:16:46.935 --> 01:16:48.102
And it worked.

01:16:48.863 --> 01:16:50.587
And it worked until it didn't.

01:16:50.589 --> 01:16:55.634
(suspenseful music)

01:16:56.379 --> 01:16:59.405
(sophia): Yeah, it's kind of
a weird situation.

01:17:00.099 --> 01:17:01.657
(indistinct chatter)

01:17:02.193 --> 01:17:04.042
- That's okay. Wasn't my thing.

01:17:04.044 --> 01:17:05.161
- See you later.

01:17:14.129 --> 01:17:15.212
(dramatic boom)

01:17:15.857 --> 01:17:16.881
- Hey.

01:17:17.558 --> 01:17:18.707
- What's going on?

01:17:18.709 --> 01:17:20.468
- I... I just wanted to talk.

01:17:21.512 --> 01:17:22.678
- Oh.

01:17:23.247 --> 01:17:24.955
You catfished me.

01:17:24.957 --> 01:17:27.307
Wait, did you catfish taylor,
too?

01:17:27.309 --> 01:17:28.901
- Yeah, I did, but--

01:17:28.903 --> 01:17:30.977
- Ew! Could you be
a bigger creep?!

01:17:30.979 --> 01:17:32.355
- Listen, no, sophia, no.
I'm not a creep.

01:17:32.357 --> 01:17:34.297
- Stay away from me.
- I'm not a creep, okay?

01:17:34.299 --> 01:17:36.717
I'm not! Sophia, sophia!
I'm not a...

01:17:36.719 --> 01:17:39.111
Listen. You're making
this something that's not

01:17:39.113 --> 01:17:41.230
Because I can't stop loving you
and you mean the--

01:17:41.232 --> 01:17:43.699
- Help!
- Sophia! Sophia, just...

01:17:43.701 --> 01:17:45.217
Please hear me out!
(thud)

01:17:45.219 --> 01:17:46.810
- Ah!
(crack)

01:17:46.812 --> 01:17:50.389
(sinister music)

01:17:50.391 --> 01:17:51.624
- Sophia?

01:17:52.927 --> 01:17:54.168
Sophia!

01:18:02.177 --> 01:18:05.888
(sobbing)

01:18:08.025 --> 01:18:10.518
(panting)

01:18:12.580 --> 01:18:13.646
(dialling)

01:18:17.435 --> 01:18:18.700
<i> (judy): Honey?</i>
- Mom?

01:18:18.702 --> 01:18:20.402
<i> - Is something wrong?</i>
- Can you...

01:18:20.404 --> 01:18:21.878
Can you please come
to city park?

01:18:21.880 --> 01:18:23.989
(crying): I just...
I think sophia's dead.

01:18:23.991 --> 01:18:26.183
<i> - What?!</i>
- Look, she's not moving

01:18:26.185 --> 01:18:28.344
And I... I don't know
what to do! I, um--

01:18:28.346 --> 01:18:29.870
<i> - What happened?</i>
<i> What did you do?</i>

01:18:29.872 --> 01:18:31.580
- No! I literally didn't do
anything, mom!

01:18:31.582 --> 01:18:33.899
I promise you! She just...
She fell!

01:18:33.901 --> 01:18:36.185
It was an accident!
I didn't...

01:18:36.187 --> 01:18:38.920
<i> - Do not touch</i>
<i> anything or anyone.</i>

01:18:38.922 --> 01:18:40.464
<i> Do not call or text anyone.</i>

01:18:40.466 --> 01:18:42.049
<i> I'm on my way.</i>

01:18:52.136 --> 01:18:56.939
(tense music)

01:18:59.718 --> 01:19:02.194
(camera clicks)

01:19:15.835 --> 01:19:17.977
(sobbing)

01:19:17.979 --> 01:19:18.835
(exhales)

01:19:18.837 --> 01:19:21.547
(trembling breaths)

01:19:27.704 --> 01:19:29.013
(gasps)

01:19:32.477 --> 01:19:34.493
- Mom, did you...
Did you call the police?

01:19:34.495 --> 01:19:36.495
- Shhh! Don't say anything!
I'm thinking!

01:19:36.497 --> 01:19:37.846
- Mom, we need to tell them.

01:19:37.848 --> 01:19:38.939
- And then what?

01:19:39.333 --> 01:19:41.424
They arrest you and charge you
for murder

01:19:41.426 --> 01:19:43.986
And your life is over?
- But mom, it was...
It was an accident.

01:19:43.988 --> 01:19:45.504
I'll tell them.
They'll believe me.

01:19:45.506 --> 01:19:47.205
- No, no, no!
What if they don't believe you?

01:19:47.207 --> 01:19:48.457
What if they don't believe you?!

01:19:48.459 --> 01:19:52.027
Okay?! Look, look, look.
I think I have a plan

01:19:52.029 --> 01:19:54.788
That will save you, okay?

01:19:54.790 --> 01:19:56.682
But you have to trust me,

01:19:56.684 --> 01:20:00.961
And you can never, ever, ever
tell anyone about tonight.

01:20:00.963 --> 01:20:02.338
Do you understand me, miles?

01:20:02.340 --> 01:20:04.340
(sobbing)
- mm-hmm.

01:20:04.859 --> 01:20:07.476
(suspenseful music)

01:20:07.478 --> 01:20:09.645
- Get in that suv and follow me!

01:20:09.647 --> 01:20:11.806
Go! Go!

01:20:14.619 --> 01:20:16.785
(miles): I didn't tell anybody
and I didn't tell you because

01:20:16.787 --> 01:20:19.096
My mom said no one will believe
it's an accident.

01:20:19.098 --> 01:20:20.989
And that if I told anybody,

01:20:20.991 --> 01:20:23.383
I'd be... I'd ruin her life.

01:20:23.644 --> 01:20:25.394
All right?
And I'd end mine, too.

01:20:25.396 --> 01:20:27.153
- But it was fine to ruin
taylor's life?

01:20:27.155 --> 01:20:28.714
(shouting): Huh?! You should've
called the police!

01:20:28.716 --> 01:20:30.032
(shouting): I wanted to!

01:20:30.642 --> 01:20:32.401
I wanted to! I'm sorry I didn't!

01:20:32.403 --> 01:20:33.953
I was scared!
I didn't know what to do!

01:20:33.955 --> 01:20:35.228
And I did not know
that my mom

01:20:35.230 --> 01:20:36.705
Was gonna do the things
that she did!

01:20:36.707 --> 01:20:38.374
I had no idea!
I didn't know!

01:20:40.002 --> 01:20:41.627
- Did judy kill lucas?

01:20:44.156 --> 01:20:45.714
- I don't know for sure,

01:20:46.158 --> 01:20:47.332
But she did leave as soon

01:20:47.334 --> 01:20:49.434
As you and your mom went
to bed and then...

01:20:49.436 --> 01:20:51.770
She... She was gone
for a few hours.

01:20:52.106 --> 01:20:53.572
- Where's your mom now?

01:20:54.274 --> 01:20:55.908
- I don't know.
She's not answering my texts.

01:20:55.910 --> 01:20:58.352
But gia, can you just
listen to me?

01:20:59.188 --> 01:21:00.396
Gia?

01:21:00.764 --> 01:21:03.732
(dialling)

01:21:08.113 --> 01:21:09.387
- Come on, mom!

01:21:09.574 --> 01:21:14.577
(whirring)

01:21:17.531 --> 01:21:19.331
- Gia, I didn't...

01:21:25.164 --> 01:21:26.838
- Don't... Don't move!

01:21:26.840 --> 01:21:28.591
- Delaney, I'm not gonna--
- no!

01:21:40.771 --> 01:21:45.399
(soft music)

01:21:53.500 --> 01:21:54.508
(dramatic boom)

01:21:54.510 --> 01:21:58.078
(threatening music)

01:22:06.780 --> 01:22:09.465
- Is this your recipe for
a perfect life?

01:22:09.467 --> 01:22:11.008
- You're joking, right?

01:22:11.702 --> 01:22:13.802
- Not really.
(phone rings)

01:22:16.223 --> 01:22:17.765
- I have to get this.

01:22:18.525 --> 01:22:21.118
Hey! Did you get in?
<i> (jack): I did.</i>

01:22:21.120 --> 01:22:23.603
- And did you see who was
driving the suv?

01:22:23.605 --> 01:22:25.105
<i> - There were two people:</i>

01:22:25.107 --> 01:22:27.757
<i> A young man in a baseball cap</i>
<i> I couldn't see very well,</i>

01:22:27.759 --> 01:22:29.668
<i> But the other person...</i>

01:22:30.020 --> 01:22:32.237
<i> It's your neighbour, judy.</i>

01:22:32.239 --> 01:22:34.523
- Judy?
<i> - Helen?</i>

01:22:34.525 --> 01:22:36.599
- Hang up so we can talk.

01:22:36.601 --> 01:22:38.860
- Talk? Are you insane?!

01:22:38.862 --> 01:22:43.165
- Please, let's just... Just
take a moment so I can explain.

01:22:43.608 --> 01:22:45.701
I want you to know
how sorry I am

01:22:45.703 --> 01:22:47.936
That things turned out
the way that they did.

01:22:47.938 --> 01:22:49.672
- You're a murderer.
- No, no, no, no, no!

01:22:49.674 --> 01:22:52.758
Nobody murdered sophia!
It was an accident!

01:22:53.386 --> 01:22:54.610
- An accident?

01:22:54.612 --> 01:22:56.461
You killed lucas!
