00:01.920 --> 00:04.089
<i>Previously on Marvel's</i>
Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D...

00:04.297 --> 00:05.548
It was snatched up by this ancient.

00:05.632 --> 00:06.841
<i>They called him Alveus.</i>

00:06.925 --> 00:09.969
<i>Designed by the Kree to command
the Inhuman army for them.</i>

00:10.303 --> 00:12.180
Well, this priceless artefact is yours.

00:12.263 --> 00:13.473
<i>Just give me the damn crystal.</i>

00:13.556 --> 00:15.433
I saw a vision of the future.

00:15.517 --> 00:16.559
What did you see?

00:16.643 --> 00:17.686
<i>My death.</i>

00:17.769 --> 00:19.771
<i>My killer... It was him.</i>

00:19.854 --> 00:21.314
Gideon, your daughter impresses me.

00:21.398 --> 00:22.607
<i>She's a true believer.</i>

00:24.401 --> 00:27.570
<i>Daisy, Giyera's taken
control of the plane.</i>

00:27.654 --> 00:29.447
We need...

00:29.531 --> 00:31.241
Everyone from our team
is on that plane.

00:31.324 --> 00:34.077
<i>You put together the
Secret Warriors Initiative for a reason.</i>

00:34.160 --> 00:35.453
<i>We both know we got to do something.</i>

00:35.829 --> 00:37.038
Let's call them in.

00:48.133 --> 00:50.552
If there's some sort of secret afterburner
you haven't kicked in yet,

00:50.635 --> 00:51.970
now would be the time.

00:52.053 --> 00:53.972
They're going as fast as they can.

00:54.055 --> 00:55.181
We'll get there.

00:57.475 --> 00:59.227
Coulson's team vanished
halfway around the world,

00:59.310 --> 01:01.396
and we still have two pickups to make.

01:02.188 --> 01:03.606
Fly faster.

01:03.690 --> 01:05.900
You have to come up
and see the roof.

01:06.693 --> 01:08.570
The city glows off the bay.

01:12.031 --> 01:13.992
I would really like that.

01:14.993 --> 01:16.035
Hello.

01:16.536 --> 01:18.371
It's good to see you again.

01:18.455 --> 01:19.956
You look well.

01:21.332 --> 01:23.293
Hello. It's...

01:32.051 --> 01:33.845
Only, maybe not tonight.

01:33.928 --> 01:34.971
Really?

01:41.227 --> 01:43.313
I'm sorry. Something's come up.

01:53.239 --> 01:55.950
Satellite scans show
massive hidden doors,

01:56.075 --> 01:58.995
a hangar buried under the oil fields
about 300 feet.

01:59.078 --> 02:01.039
What is, uh, HYDRA?

02:01.122 --> 02:04.793
Kidnapping Inhumans, global terrorism,
all-around bad dudes.

02:04.876 --> 02:06.669
- How'd they take the plane?
- Don't know.

02:06.753 --> 02:08.588
- What's the base's layout?
- Don't know.

02:08.670 --> 02:10.256
How many soldiers?

02:10.340 --> 02:12.550
- We don't...
- You don't know.

02:12.634 --> 02:14.969
We don't have much,

02:15.053 --> 02:18.431
but these are friends who've put their
lives on the lines for each of us, right?

02:18.515 --> 02:19.641
But we do have a way in,

02:19.724 --> 02:22.227
service wells that can get us
within 50 feet of the base.

02:22.310 --> 02:23.645
And what about the other 50 feet?

02:23.728 --> 02:24.979
I'll take care of that.

02:25.063 --> 02:27.315
Okay. Uh, when do we land?

02:47.335 --> 02:48.586
For one reason or another,

02:49.212 --> 02:50.755
each of us has been given a gift.

02:51.339 --> 02:52.757
Let's put them to good use.

03:11.776 --> 03:13.444
I'm glad you've arrived.

03:13.528 --> 03:15.864
They had our location,
so I took the plane.

03:16.364 --> 03:17.866
What about the agents?

03:17.949 --> 03:19.367
Did any survive?

03:19.450 --> 03:22.537
I was outnumbered, so I got off
as quickly as I could, sent in a team.

03:22.620 --> 03:24.914
Lucio will have them
under control soon.

03:30.587 --> 03:31.796
Come on, come on!

03:33.047 --> 03:34.090
Coulson!

03:43.308 --> 03:45.101
Look for anything in here
that will mess with those guys.

03:48.813 --> 03:50.481
May's bleeding pretty badly.

03:50.607 --> 03:51.649
We need to stop it now.

03:51.733 --> 03:53.318
The hatch won't hold for long.

03:53.443 --> 03:56.571
Fitz, find me something
that will keep these guys at bay.

04:06.998 --> 04:09.334
Well, I guess we can call this area clear.

04:09.417 --> 04:10.418
Split up.

04:10.501 --> 04:12.086
Lincoln and I go solo.

04:12.170 --> 04:13.254
You guys take the elevator.

04:13.338 --> 04:15.673
Find our team, report back.

05:04.514 --> 05:05.682
I got eyes on the Zephyr.

05:05.765 --> 05:08.142
Entrance is on the north side,
sub-level five.

05:08.226 --> 05:09.978
Crash on that location.

05:44.178 --> 05:45.471
I've got Malick.

05:51.019 --> 05:52.186
Catalyst. Careful.

05:52.270 --> 05:53.479
Here's a cloth.
And May needs compression.

05:53.563 --> 05:54.689
On it.

05:54.772 --> 05:55.815
The door.

05:55.982 --> 05:57.025
Here.

05:58.735 --> 06:00.319
This seal gonna hold?

06:00.695 --> 06:02.572
Hope so. It's chlorine gas.

06:04.032 --> 06:05.742
If not, we'll all go blind.

06:05.825 --> 06:06.868
What?

06:16.377 --> 06:17.670
Guys,

06:17.754 --> 06:19.338
I'm coming to you.

06:23.426 --> 06:24.469
Joey!

06:30.475 --> 06:31.601
I said I'd come to you.

06:33.061 --> 06:35.063
- You okay?
- Yeah. Go, go, go.

06:49.410 --> 06:50.453
Lincoln!

06:51.829 --> 06:52.872
Lincoln!

07:02.048 --> 07:04.133
Shoot anything
that comes through that door.

07:10.056 --> 07:11.099
Hello?

07:11.307 --> 07:12.850
What the hell?

07:19.649 --> 07:20.691
Mack.

07:23.653 --> 07:25.238
It's good to see you again.

07:25.321 --> 07:26.656
You look well.

07:26.739 --> 07:27.990
I'm doing real good now.

07:29.283 --> 07:30.618
What took you so long?

07:30.701 --> 07:33.746
Sorry. Had to get
the band back together.

07:33.830 --> 07:35.289
Got anyone who can fly this thing?

07:36.749 --> 07:38.376
May! You can't even walk.

07:38.918 --> 07:40.878
But I can still fly.

07:50.471 --> 07:52.306
We lost them again

07:52.390 --> 07:53.808
and achieved nothing.

07:54.225 --> 07:55.309
Not true.

07:59.021 --> 08:01.023
Now I have one on the inside.

08:04.402 --> 08:05.736
Elevator door opens.

08:05.820 --> 08:07.321
He comes out. Bullets...

08:07.488 --> 08:08.656
Boom, boom, boom!

08:08.823 --> 08:10.158
And soldiers...

08:11.993 --> 08:13.202
This man!

08:13.286 --> 08:15.997
Hey, I just stopped the bullets,
but you dropped them down.

08:16.080 --> 08:17.623
You guys all did so good.

08:17.707 --> 08:19.458
We were asked for a miracle,
and we came through.

08:21.085 --> 08:22.628
You're a hell of a team.

08:23.337 --> 08:24.380
You okay?

08:25.798 --> 08:27.049
Oh, I didn't feel it.

08:28.050 --> 08:29.969
- You run fast, things happen, huh?
- Yeah.

08:30.052 --> 08:31.679
- You sure you're all right?
- Yeah.

08:32.429 --> 08:33.764
Hey.

08:33.847 --> 08:36.225
Thanks for having my back
when I went down.

08:36.308 --> 08:37.684
You saved me.

08:38.144 --> 08:39.477
Daisy's right. It was a good day.

08:39.854 --> 08:42.481
No, when you grab the head of HYDRA,
it's a great day.

08:42.899 --> 08:44.150
You think he'll give us anything?

08:44.232 --> 08:45.776
Well, Coulson's questioning him now.

08:45.860 --> 08:48.362
Soon, you'll get cleared to go home,
but if he talks,

08:48.446 --> 08:49.906
we might be on another mission.

09:01.876 --> 09:03.502
You had Rosalind Price killed.

09:04.712 --> 09:07.798
I haven't decided what to do
about that in the long run, but right now,

09:07.882 --> 09:09.383
I need to know,

09:09.467 --> 09:12.762
what is that thing
parading around as Grant Ward?

09:14.639 --> 09:16.349
You ever ride Arabians?

09:17.391 --> 09:19.268
I'm not really the equestrian type.

09:20.853 --> 09:23.231
Magnificent horses, hard to control.

09:23.314 --> 09:25.983
Stephanie rode Arabians, my daughter.

09:26.400 --> 09:28.694
We were riding once in the Tetons,

09:28.778 --> 09:31.781
and there was this rockslide up ahead,

09:31.864 --> 09:33.616
and her horse bucked,

09:33.699 --> 09:36.285
threw her right off.
And my heart stopped.

09:37.495 --> 09:40.623
But she got up and calmed that horse

09:42.333 --> 09:45.544
in a way that made me more proud
than anything I'd ever done.

09:46.379 --> 09:48.673
That was the day
I told her about HYDRA.

09:48.756 --> 09:49.966
Brought her into the fold.

09:50.049 --> 09:51.550
Where's Stephanie now, Gideon?

09:52.260 --> 09:53.678
I was foolish.

09:53.761 --> 09:55.763
I thought that I could
bring back the HYDRA

09:55.846 --> 09:57.473
and guide it the same way Stephanie

09:57.556 --> 09:59.016
commanded that horse.

09:59.100 --> 10:03.145
I taught her to have faith in it as a god.

10:03.229 --> 10:04.355
And she did.

10:04.438 --> 10:05.648
If you ever want to see her again...

10:05.731 --> 10:07.066
He killed her.

10:08.818 --> 10:10.569
Cares nothing for us.

10:13.281 --> 10:14.949
Doesn't sound like a god.

10:15.950 --> 10:18.995
Oh, no, Mr Coulson. It is a god,

10:19.078 --> 10:21.289
it's just not ours.

10:24.667 --> 10:26.002
What are you doing?

10:27.044 --> 10:28.087
Just checking it out.

10:30.214 --> 10:32.174
You really think it belonged
to that Alveus guy?

10:32.258 --> 10:33.342
It's so old.

10:33.426 --> 10:35.469
I don't know, but we better check it in,

10:36.095 --> 10:37.388
along with the Terrigen.

10:39.140 --> 10:42.268
You're still upset I took
that crystal to James' shack.

10:42.351 --> 10:44.562
Yes, I am. You should have told me.

10:45.771 --> 10:47.440
I thought if you didn't know,
you couldn't be blamed.

10:47.523 --> 10:48.691
And if something went wrong?

10:49.108 --> 10:50.359
I know.

10:50.443 --> 10:51.736
I'm sorry.

10:52.611 --> 10:55.614
Can't be easy having
your boyfriend on the team.

10:55.698 --> 10:57.908
Not when you take advantage
of that relationship.

10:59.702 --> 11:01.537
I thought you'd understand the move.

11:10.254 --> 11:11.297
It was a good play.

11:13.007 --> 11:14.425
Just tell me next time.

11:16.844 --> 11:18.637
You should check in on Joey.

11:18.763 --> 11:20.806
I think killing Lucio
has him pretty shaken.

11:25.227 --> 11:26.395
I completely missed it.

11:27.021 --> 11:28.606
They did good today,

11:28.689 --> 11:30.983
but there is a lot
to get used to at S.H.I.E.L.D.

11:50.544 --> 11:52.213
I have a new name, too.

11:52.296 --> 11:53.422
They all call me "Yo-Yo."

11:53.506 --> 11:54.548
Your fault.

12:00.554 --> 12:03.265
I will get my revenge.

12:03.349 --> 12:05.601
And your Spanish is much better,
not just

12:06.352 --> 12:07.436
<i>"pescado."</i>

12:07.520 --> 12:09.188
Yeah.

12:09.730 --> 12:11.857
It's a new S.H.I.E.L.D. requirement.

12:16.529 --> 12:18.280
I know you think
S.H.I.E.L.D. is dangerous,

12:18.364 --> 12:21.242
but, really, our mission is to protect.

12:30.334 --> 12:31.377
And these?

12:32.711 --> 12:33.921
Those kill.

12:34.922 --> 12:36.298
You do your best, but...

12:37.091 --> 12:38.634
Some days are tougher than others.

12:38.717 --> 12:40.177
It's okay, Mack.

12:40.261 --> 12:41.387
I trust you.

12:46.725 --> 12:48.269
What on earth are you doing?

12:48.352 --> 12:49.520
Well, you're the doctor.

12:49.603 --> 12:50.729
Is he dead or not?

12:51.355 --> 12:53.441
His body temperature is 98 degrees.

12:58.028 --> 12:59.405
Dead-ish.

12:59.488 --> 13:01.699
There's some sort of metabolic activity.

13:01.991 --> 13:03.200
Fascinating.

13:03.284 --> 13:05.494
No, not fascinating.

13:05.578 --> 13:06.620
Quarantine.

13:07.246 --> 13:08.372
Quarantine.

13:17.631 --> 13:19.758
Excuse us. Nothing to worry about.

13:21.260 --> 13:23.179
<i>There is a reckoning coming.</i>

13:23.721 --> 13:26.640
You put your faith
in the Inhumans like I did.

13:27.141 --> 13:28.767
It is a deadly mistake.

13:29.101 --> 13:31.395
They will all worship him.

13:31.479 --> 13:33.647
He's not a god.

13:33.731 --> 13:36.233
As far as we know,
he was a slave to the Kree.

13:36.317 --> 13:38.319
What better beginning for a god?

13:38.402 --> 13:40.404
They called him "Alveus."

13:40.488 --> 13:42.156
Do you know that word?

13:42.239 --> 13:43.491
It's Latin.

13:43.574 --> 13:44.783
It means "Hive,"

13:45.493 --> 13:47.620
which is fitting, because he's a parasite,

13:48.454 --> 13:50.664
swarms, eats,

13:50.748 --> 13:53.042
moves from corpse to corpse.

13:53.125 --> 13:55.002
Well, that's one way to see it.

13:55.461 --> 13:57.546
You're not really a religious man,
are you?

13:58.088 --> 13:59.715
I have faith in my team.

13:59.798 --> 14:01.884
That's what he'll destroy first.

14:01.967 --> 14:04.762
You said they'll worship him.
What did you mean?

14:06.805 --> 14:10.559
I'm saying that those that were
loyal to me now serve him.

14:12.061 --> 14:15.147
He infected them,
became a part of them,

14:15.231 --> 14:17.816
and they instantly joined the hive.

14:18.526 --> 14:20.236
Mind control?

14:20.319 --> 14:23.405
You're the head of HYDRA.
Why would I ever believe you?

14:25.366 --> 14:28.244
You don't have to believe.
You'll see soon enough.

14:28.827 --> 14:33.123
You sent four Inhumans into his lair,
and now they're in your base.

14:33.207 --> 14:35.626
How many of them
do you think he turned?

14:38.087 --> 14:41.590
If you trust any of them, stop now.

15:18.794 --> 15:20.004
Everything okay?

15:23.048 --> 15:25.676
I need you
to quietly lock down the base.

15:30.347 --> 15:31.515
Malick has no proof.

15:31.640 --> 15:33.058
I have to take this threat seriously.

15:33.142 --> 15:36.729
Well, then, let's get ahead of it.
We can talk to them, scan them.

15:36.812 --> 15:38.188
We have no way to test for this.

15:38.272 --> 15:40.482
If any of them are sick,
they could be very dangerous.

15:40.566 --> 15:41.984
They need to be in containment now.

15:42.067 --> 15:44.361
Then what?
Simmons said it, there's no test.

15:44.445 --> 15:46.447
Are we gonna question them?
What do we ask?

15:46.530 --> 15:48.532
"Are you infected? No? Great. Thanks."

15:49.283 --> 15:51.910
None of this works if they know
we know. I need more.

15:51.994 --> 15:53.579
Lucio's body
had some abnormal readings.

15:53.662 --> 15:54.705
Maybe we could start there.

15:54.788 --> 15:57.750
That could help us confirm
whether Malick's full of it.

15:57.833 --> 15:58.876
Get me proof.

15:58.959 --> 16:01.045
If this is real, any one of them
could have been turned,

16:01.128 --> 16:03.464
or all of them.
I need a test and then a cure.

16:03.547 --> 16:04.757
That's a hell of a gamble.

16:04.840 --> 16:06.550
It's our best shot.

16:06.634 --> 16:08.677
We keep everyone
contained to the base.

16:08.761 --> 16:10.638
If anyone's infected,
they came for a reason.

16:10.721 --> 16:12.306
We monitor them,
let them show their hand.

16:12.389 --> 16:13.932
They saved our lives,

16:14.016 --> 16:15.434
and now we can't trust the lot of them.

16:20.648 --> 16:23.609
Sorry. I came when I saw the base
was on lockdown. What's up?

16:24.151 --> 16:26.153
It's a security precaution
while Malick's in custody.

16:26.236 --> 16:27.571
Right.

16:27.655 --> 16:29.698
Did we get any info on Zombie Ward?

16:29.782 --> 16:31.867
- Not yet, but I'm confident we will.
- Good.

16:31.950 --> 16:33.035
If we get intel, let me know.

16:33.118 --> 16:34.411
I'd like my team
to get another shot at him.

16:34.995 --> 16:36.330
Um, but you should know

16:36.413 --> 16:38.707
Joey crossed off Lucio.

16:38.791 --> 16:40.292
I'm not sure he was
ready for that, or ready

16:40.376 --> 16:41.919
to be back in the field after it.

16:42.628 --> 16:44.588
That's hard. I'll check in on him.

16:45.130 --> 16:46.173
Thanks.

16:50.844 --> 16:52.471
Get me answers.

16:52.554 --> 16:54.181
What do you mean?

16:54.264 --> 16:55.307
I not leave?

16:55.933 --> 16:58.560
This is common. It's just
a security thing since Malick's here.

16:58.644 --> 16:59.978
Security?

17:01.689 --> 17:03.774
I want to do something, or I go home.

17:03.857 --> 17:05.233
Have they cracked him yet?

17:05.317 --> 17:07.027
He's cooperating,
but we have to be patient.

17:07.111 --> 17:08.237
We'll get our chance.

17:14.742 --> 17:16.078
Have you talked to Joey yet?

17:16.161 --> 17:18.163
I've tried. I can't find him anywhere.

17:25.295 --> 17:26.755
Time for your pain meds.

17:26.839 --> 17:28.006
I don't want that.

17:28.549 --> 17:30.676
Trust me, in an hour, you will.

17:31.677 --> 17:32.928
Those knock me out.

17:33.011 --> 17:35.055
May, he's trying to help you.

17:36.348 --> 17:37.891
Just give me a minute with her.

17:41.645 --> 17:42.688
Meet me in my room?

17:42.771 --> 17:43.897
Yeah.

17:45.691 --> 17:47.818
How are you doing, really?

17:48.318 --> 17:50.154
I'm in a lot of pain,

17:50.237 --> 17:51.905
and I hate this hospital gown.

17:51.989 --> 17:53.365
Mmm. You think?

17:55.492 --> 17:57.369
You did good today.

17:57.453 --> 17:58.495
You led them well.

17:58.579 --> 18:00.247
Does it ever get any easier?

18:00.330 --> 18:01.498
Only harder.

18:03.459 --> 18:04.543
Why?

18:05.669 --> 18:09.047
I think Coulson's having me
lie to them about the base lockdown.

18:09.131 --> 18:10.215
They can feel it.

18:10.799 --> 18:12.259
Sometimes, that's the job.

18:13.010 --> 18:14.511
Doesn't feel right.

18:14.970 --> 18:17.181
If he's withholding,

18:17.264 --> 18:19.391
I'm sure it's for the right reasons.

18:21.685 --> 18:23.520
I got to ask,

18:23.604 --> 18:25.189
you wanted all of this,

18:25.272 --> 18:26.482
what did you think would happen?

18:26.565 --> 18:29.234
You don't understand
what it's like to be brought up in faith.

18:29.318 --> 18:31.570
We were C-and-E Catholics.

18:31.653 --> 18:33.197
Sure, it's no death cult.

18:33.280 --> 18:35.824
Then you know we all have our sins.

18:36.325 --> 18:39.286
I believed that I could resurrect a god.

18:40.829 --> 18:42.748
But instead, I freed the Devil.

18:43.791 --> 18:44.833
Only technically.

18:44.917 --> 18:48.212
I mean, all the ancient
Satanic creation myths,

18:48.295 --> 18:50.547
they were based on him,
which you knew.

18:51.006 --> 18:52.841
The Devil promises everything

18:53.550 --> 18:56.053
and then lets you destroy
your own world.

18:57.137 --> 18:59.348
I sacrificed my brother to him.

18:59.431 --> 19:01.350
Still, he took my daughter.

19:03.602 --> 19:05.562
And that image...

19:05.646 --> 19:07.773
Of her body lying on that floor...

19:09.566 --> 19:10.609
I failed her.

19:12.861 --> 19:14.363
What else matters?

19:14.446 --> 19:15.739
What you do next matters.

19:17.866 --> 19:21.328
Are you trying to sell me on the idea
that I can set everything right?

19:22.120 --> 19:24.581
I'm trying to sell you on revenge.

19:24.998 --> 19:26.375
I have an image, too,

19:26.458 --> 19:28.544
of a body on the floor.

19:28.627 --> 19:30.712
Rosalind Price.

19:30.796 --> 19:32.798
Love turned to rage in that moment.

19:34.925 --> 19:38.136
So I hunted down
and murdered Grant Ward.

19:38.262 --> 19:39.471
Not to serve any good.

19:39.596 --> 19:40.973
Not to serve any belief.

19:41.098 --> 19:42.891
I wanted revenge.

19:42.975 --> 19:44.768
I wanted to feel him die.

19:47.604 --> 19:50.816
That's the sin that gave
your devil new life.

19:51.608 --> 19:53.569
To come and take everything we love.

19:53.652 --> 19:57.030
Let it turn into rage.
Tell me how to stop him.

19:57.948 --> 19:59.116
This god has outlived...

19:59.199 --> 20:00.826
I've met gods.

20:01.618 --> 20:02.953
Gods bleed.

20:04.454 --> 20:07.958
I never saw my last rodeo
being with S.H.I.E.L.D.

20:11.879 --> 20:13.463
What would you like to know?

20:15.465 --> 20:17.467
Start with everything.

20:19.803 --> 20:21.972
<i>No.
You can't ask me to do that again.</i>

20:22.472 --> 20:24.391
<i>Trust me, Joey. We'll figure this out.</i>

20:48.415 --> 20:50.167
Now I'm just seeing things.

20:59.092 --> 21:01.136
Whatever the hell is going on,

21:01.219 --> 21:03.138
the Inhumans are wondering about it.

21:03.221 --> 21:06.224
Also, what the hell is going on, Mack?

21:08.352 --> 21:10.187
Too damn much.

21:10.854 --> 21:13.065
Subject was 36, male, Colombian.

21:13.190 --> 21:15.817
Cause of death,
exsanguination due to stab wound.

21:15.901 --> 21:17.945
Toxicology and blood work
have shown normal levels.

21:18.028 --> 21:20.739
Though the body maintained
a temperature of 98 degrees,

21:20.864 --> 21:22.616
which is very bizarre.

21:22.699 --> 21:24.451
Simmons will try and make this
sound science-y,

21:24.576 --> 21:25.619
but for the record,

21:25.702 --> 21:27.537
we're about to split open
this guy's head.

21:27.621 --> 21:30.123
Fitz doesn't approve of voice notes.

21:39.216 --> 21:41.593
So, um, you seen any movies lately?

21:42.719 --> 21:44.429
You're asking me to one?

21:46.556 --> 21:47.599
What's wrong?

21:47.724 --> 21:50.227
I just want an hour

21:50.310 --> 21:52.729
without imagining that half our
teammates are gonna kill us.

21:52.813 --> 21:54.189
Joey offed this guy.

21:54.272 --> 21:56.525
Picture the hell Yo-Yo could raise.

21:56.608 --> 21:57.776
Or Daisy.

21:58.068 --> 22:00.112
Lincoln could electrocute us
in our sleep.

22:01.488 --> 22:02.823
Or any time, really.

22:04.741 --> 22:05.784
I see your point.

22:06.159 --> 22:07.953
How do we land in these situations?

22:08.078 --> 22:09.413
We're S.H.I.E.L.D. agents.

22:09.496 --> 22:10.580
Today could be worse.

22:10.831 --> 22:12.040
We're in hazmat suits.

22:12.124 --> 22:13.959
Yeah. To help our friends.

22:15.627 --> 22:16.753
They're lucky to have you.

22:28.849 --> 22:30.100
Fitz.

22:32.602 --> 22:34.271
Why are you calling me
out of an interrogation?

22:34.771 --> 22:36.606
And what the hell
are you doing out of bed?

22:36.690 --> 22:37.899
Fitz-Simmons are on their way.

22:37.983 --> 22:39.943
They confirmed Lucio's infection.

22:40.027 --> 22:41.611
Malick wasn't lying.

22:41.695 --> 22:43.155
I so badly hoped he was.

22:43.280 --> 22:44.823
The parasites infest
deep in the brain,

22:44.948 --> 22:46.950
but the good news is it doesn't
seem to cause permanent damage.

22:47.034 --> 22:49.286
But they don't have a test, not yet.

22:49.536 --> 22:51.079
Surveillance isn't working.

22:51.163 --> 22:52.622
They're all over the base. It's a threat.

22:52.706 --> 22:53.790
We need to quarantine them.

22:53.874 --> 22:54.958
I don't know how
to convince them, but...

22:55.042 --> 22:56.126
Telling them is too dangerous.

22:56.710 --> 22:57.878
We have to ICE them.

22:58.628 --> 23:00.255
I'll explain when they're safe.

23:00.338 --> 23:01.923
Anything suspicious on the cameras?

23:02.007 --> 23:04.926
Everyone looks suspicious
if you stare at them long enough.

23:05.010 --> 23:07.012
I mean, Joey's a ghost,
arguing with Lincoln.

23:07.137 --> 23:09.222
And I think Yo-Yo scoped out
every angle of this base.

23:09.306 --> 23:11.600
Lincoln tried to pump me full of meds
before I talked to Daisy.

23:11.683 --> 23:12.809
Yeah, but he is a doctor.

23:13.977 --> 23:15.020
What did Daisy say?

23:16.396 --> 23:18.190
She felt like you were lying to her.

23:19.316 --> 23:20.484
What game are we playing?

23:22.903 --> 23:24.821
I think we're about to find out.

23:37.584 --> 23:38.877
No.

23:45.675 --> 23:48.345
Why sabotage the power?
Good luck escaping.

23:48.428 --> 23:50.472
Perimeter security
is on the emergency generator...

23:50.555 --> 23:51.598
Fitz.

23:51.681 --> 23:53.350
...but the security cameras aren't.

23:53.517 --> 23:55.352
Is that Malick's room?

24:25.799 --> 24:26.883
Are you all right?

24:29.136 --> 24:31.096
What happened? You okay?

24:31.471 --> 24:32.764
Malick's door was open.

24:33.140 --> 24:34.349
He was already dead.

24:34.432 --> 24:36.852
A bloody grenade went off
right in front of us.

24:36.935 --> 24:38.270
Covering up the cause of death.

24:39.062 --> 24:40.981
- Can you walk?
- Yeah.

24:41.731 --> 24:42.774
Okay. Come with me.

24:45.110 --> 24:47.946
Mack and May are gathering teams
to quarantine the Inhumans.

24:48.071 --> 24:50.740
Get yourselves patched up
and find a place to lay low for a while.

24:50.824 --> 24:51.908
What happened? Are you okay?

24:51.992 --> 24:53.034
We're fine.

24:53.118 --> 24:54.578
She said she's fine.

24:55.120 --> 24:57.455
- I'm trying to help.
- What was that blast?

24:57.581 --> 24:58.748
Go into the common area.

24:58.832 --> 25:00.208
I'll brief everyone there
in a few moments.

25:00.292 --> 25:02.210
Are we in danger? What the hell?

25:02.294 --> 25:04.004
Go into the common area.
That's an order.

25:04.087 --> 25:05.463
You've kept us in the dark all day.

25:05.589 --> 25:06.840
There's a situation, Daisy.

25:06.923 --> 25:09.384
I need you
to get your team to cooperate.

25:09.467 --> 25:10.927
Were we attacked?

25:11.178 --> 25:12.220
Everything will be all right.

25:12.304 --> 25:14.264
I just need you
to stay right where you are.

25:19.477 --> 25:21.354
May, be cool.

25:22.772 --> 25:23.815
Where's Joey?

25:23.940 --> 25:26.735
I don't know. Coulson, you need
to level with me right now.

25:26.818 --> 25:28.153
We need to get you checked out.

25:28.278 --> 25:30.113
Hive can sway Inhumans.

25:30.447 --> 25:32.407
Your team may have been
exposed in the rescue.

25:32.490 --> 25:34.326
Wait. "Sway."

25:34.451 --> 25:35.452
Like mind control?

25:35.535 --> 25:36.745
One of you killed Malick.

25:36.828 --> 25:39.748
I'm trying to keep everyone safe,
including you. Where's Joey?

25:39.831 --> 25:40.916
My team wouldn't do that.

25:40.999 --> 25:42.167
They wouldn't have a choice.

25:42.292 --> 25:43.418
It's like an infection.

25:45.962 --> 25:47.714
I swear that's what I'm doing, Yo-Yo.

25:47.797 --> 25:49.633
We saved your asses,
and you come at us?

25:49.716 --> 25:51.635
Lincoln. Why didn't you tell us?

25:51.718 --> 25:53.053
Daisy, stand down.

25:53.136 --> 25:56.056
First, we get everyone in quarantine,
and then we can talk.

25:56.139 --> 25:57.349
Not everyone.

25:57.474 --> 25:59.351
Anybody in here
could have killed Malick,

25:59.476 --> 26:00.894
but you singled us out right away.

26:00.977 --> 26:02.145
Lincoln, stop it!

26:14.991 --> 26:16.034
What's happening?

26:16.159 --> 26:17.327
Where the hell have you been?

26:17.452 --> 26:19.955
If we don't get these doors blocked,
nobody's questions get answered!

26:20.038 --> 26:21.122
Got it!

26:23.959 --> 26:25.210
Someone explain what's going on.

26:26.503 --> 26:28.171
Malick's dead.

26:28.296 --> 26:30.215
- They suspect us.
- Well, why would they think that?

26:30.340 --> 26:32.259
They think Hive infected one of us
while we were in that base.

26:32.342 --> 26:33.426
- Messed with our heads.
- Where were you?

26:33.510 --> 26:35.220
- What?
- Where were you, Joey?

26:35.345 --> 26:36.638
The base went dark.
I was looking for you.

26:36.721 --> 26:37.764
Infected?

26:37.847 --> 26:39.099
That glass not gonna keep them out.

26:39.182 --> 26:40.725
Right. How do we fix this?

26:40.850 --> 26:42.227
We stay calm, and we stick together.

26:42.352 --> 26:43.603
Why are they sure it's one of us?

26:43.687 --> 26:45.689
Malick, whatever he said to Coulson
has him spooked.

26:45.814 --> 26:48.233
But he could be wrong.
I mean, they're taking his word for it?

26:51.361 --> 26:52.404
- What?
- What?

26:52.529 --> 26:54.030
Screw S.H.I.E.L.D.

26:55.532 --> 26:57.534
Jiaying was terrified of Hive returning.

26:58.034 --> 26:59.202
Now I can see why.

26:59.327 --> 27:01.121
You know Fitz-Simmons
quarantined Lucio's body?

27:01.204 --> 27:02.289
Why didn't they tell us sooner?

27:02.372 --> 27:04.457
If that's true, this is exactly why
Coulson didn't say anything.

27:04.541 --> 27:05.709
- Anybody has...
- And if that is true,

27:05.834 --> 27:07.585
I don't want you telling me what to think.

27:07.711 --> 27:10.380
Any of you.
We were all alone in that base.

27:11.423 --> 27:12.632
Any of you could be infected.

27:12.716 --> 27:13.967
Any one of us.

27:14.050 --> 27:15.510
That includes you.

27:22.183 --> 27:23.226
They're ready to go.

27:23.351 --> 27:25.478
Or we can pump in sleeping gas
if you give me 10.

27:25.562 --> 27:26.604
Contain for now.

27:26.730 --> 27:28.648
If they're arguing,
that means they're not all turned.

27:28.732 --> 27:31.860
Search their bunks and lockers.
Figure out what we're missing here.

27:32.360 --> 27:34.779
Hopefully, someone in there
is doing the same thing.

27:34.904 --> 27:36.281
I saw it, Yo-Yo.

27:36.406 --> 27:37.991
That's not a bullet wound,
so how'd you get it?

27:38.074 --> 27:39.367
I fight 10 people.

27:39.451 --> 27:40.493
Accident.

27:43.913 --> 27:44.956
What are you saying?

27:45.081 --> 27:46.333
Could you please
speak English right now?

27:48.209 --> 27:49.878
Hey, look. It's not important, okay?

27:49.961 --> 27:53.006
I don't care which one of you did this.
I just want to leave, one way or another.

27:53.089 --> 27:54.966
Are you saying you'll fight S.H.I.E.L.D.
to get out of here?

27:55.091 --> 27:56.092
Because that means me, too.

27:56.217 --> 27:58.511
They're about to break in.
I am not going back into isolation.

27:58.595 --> 27:59.721
Why not?

27:59.804 --> 28:00.847
Alone all day, no?

28:00.930 --> 28:02.057
I just needed some time, okay?

28:02.140 --> 28:04.142
Joey, you were completely AWOL
when Malick was killed.

28:04.267 --> 28:06.186
- That's not okay.
- I don't care about Malick.

28:06.269 --> 28:08.063
You were the one gunning for him,
and now he's dead.

28:08.146 --> 28:09.189
That's not on me.

28:09.272 --> 28:11.733
Gunning for intel, not to kill him.
He's the head of HYDRA.

28:11.816 --> 28:13.318
But it's a fair point.

28:14.277 --> 28:15.612
Excuse me?

28:16.112 --> 28:18.365
I wanted to get to Malick
to finish off Ward or...

28:18.448 --> 28:19.574
Or Hive or whatever.

28:19.657 --> 28:21.117
Friends died. You know that.

28:21.242 --> 28:22.410
Where were you
when the lights went out?

28:22.494 --> 28:24.371
I was in my room,
where I told you to meet me.

28:24.454 --> 28:27.457
Where were you, sparky,
during the electrical failure?

28:29.793 --> 28:30.835
Sorry.

28:30.960 --> 28:32.587
We're supposed to be a team.

28:32.670 --> 28:34.714
This team is sick.

28:34.798 --> 28:36.549
How do we know whoever
turned can't infect the rest?

28:36.633 --> 28:37.759
There's no evidence of that.

28:37.842 --> 28:40.387
I just want out,
with or without your help.

28:40.470 --> 28:41.638
Hey, hey, hey!

28:42.806 --> 28:44.391
Suddenly, you're willing
to fight your way out?

28:44.474 --> 28:46.643
Me, too. I don't trust anyone.

28:46.768 --> 28:47.852
No one leaves.

28:50.105 --> 28:51.272
We need to get out of here.

28:51.356 --> 28:52.982
Stop! He's right! He's right.

28:53.108 --> 28:55.151
We should get somewhere safe,
figure this out on our own terms.

28:55.276 --> 28:56.361
What?

28:56.486 --> 28:58.655
We can't leave
and let an infected person escape!

28:58.780 --> 29:00.824
It's better than someone in here
or out there getting killed.

29:03.827 --> 29:04.994
Okay.

29:05.495 --> 29:06.663
Coulson has a hidden elevator.

29:06.996 --> 29:08.748
It used to be an old underground exit.

29:08.832 --> 29:12.335
Maybe I can break through to get out.
It's the only way we all live today.

29:16.005 --> 29:17.048
Okay. Let's go.

29:22.846 --> 29:24.848
Do we even know
what we're supposed to be looking for?

29:27.976 --> 29:29.811
We do now.

29:33.815 --> 29:35.358
No, no. This way.

29:35.483 --> 29:36.693
It's not much further.

29:39.362 --> 29:41.489
The original passage
is hidden through here.

29:42.031 --> 29:43.825
I hope you're sure about this.

29:47.245 --> 29:48.329
Hi.

29:49.581 --> 29:50.623
You sold us out!

29:51.875 --> 29:52.959
I'm sorry.

29:53.042 --> 29:55.211
If someone's infected,
I had to make this call.

29:55.336 --> 29:56.379
I mean no harm.

29:56.754 --> 29:59.799
We're all a part of the same team,
but one of us is sick.

29:59.883 --> 30:02.469
I didn't say anything earlier
because we didn't know who it was,

30:02.552 --> 30:03.887
but now we do.

30:05.263 --> 30:07.640
Let me guess,
when you decided to leave,

30:07.724 --> 30:09.392
Lincoln didn't want to go.

30:10.727 --> 30:12.061
Not without his prize.

30:12.604 --> 30:15.565
This was taken from the assets room
and hidden in your locker.

30:15.690 --> 30:17.066
I didn't do that.

30:18.902 --> 30:21.070
Daisy, you have to believe me.

30:21.696 --> 30:23.114
You know how to get in there.

30:23.239 --> 30:24.574
You've stolen from that room before.

30:25.074 --> 30:26.367
Yeah. That was different.

30:26.451 --> 30:28.286
No.

30:28.411 --> 30:29.829
That was exactly the same.

30:29.913 --> 30:31.873
From the moment
Hive popped up on our radar,

30:32.457 --> 30:33.750
you suddenly knew where to find this

30:33.875 --> 30:35.043
and had your hands on it

30:35.126 --> 30:37.462
until our distress call
diverted you to Malick's base.

30:37.587 --> 30:40.673
Exactly. That was before any of us
could have been exposed to Hive!

30:40.757 --> 30:42.926
- Was it?
- Transia.

30:44.761 --> 30:46.054
The rooftop.

30:46.137 --> 30:48.473
Daisy fought Malick. I found the bodies.

30:48.598 --> 30:50.141
But you said you caught
a glimpse of Ward, didn't you?

30:53.102 --> 30:55.146
So you're saying
he wasn't turned last night?

30:55.605 --> 30:56.606
No.

30:59.275 --> 31:00.777
He's been turned this whole time.

31:01.444 --> 31:03.655
I wasn't anywhere close to Hive!

31:03.780 --> 31:05.365
We can fix this, Lincoln.
Let us help you.

31:05.448 --> 31:06.658
Leave me alone!

31:14.123 --> 31:15.250
Lincoln!

31:31.140 --> 31:32.517
We were good together.

31:33.977 --> 31:36.604
And yet, it took so little
to split our team apart.

31:38.856 --> 31:40.441
I failed them.

31:40.525 --> 31:42.110
This is being a leader.

31:42.193 --> 31:43.987
You want to protect everyone,
but you can't.

31:44.112 --> 31:45.989
People get hurt.

31:46.114 --> 31:47.323
Today wasn't your fault.

31:47.448 --> 31:48.950
Doesn't feel that way.

31:51.619 --> 31:53.746
We were attacked
by something very smart

31:53.830 --> 31:56.040
and very dangerous.

31:57.000 --> 31:59.335
<i>Hive destroyed the most
sacred thing for a team...</i>

32:00.837 --> 32:01.879
Yo-Yo.

32:02.005 --> 32:03.381
My name is Elena.

32:04.382 --> 32:05.842
...<i>trust.</i>

32:15.685 --> 32:17.937
When will the results come in?

32:18.021 --> 32:19.147
Soon.

32:19.230 --> 32:20.523
Good.

32:22.150 --> 32:24.569
Because I think
I don't want to be here any more.

32:28.573 --> 32:31.701
<i>I know you want to
destroy Hive for what he's done to you.</i>

32:32.994 --> 32:35.038
<i>We all do, and we will.</i>

32:37.999 --> 32:39.834
<i>I know you want revenge,</i>

32:40.543 --> 32:42.086
<i>but we have to be better.</i>

32:43.379 --> 32:45.548
We have to do what's best for the team.

32:47.258 --> 32:49.302
It's times like these,

32:49.385 --> 32:51.846
when there's no clear path,

32:51.929 --> 32:54.057
that I understand why people pray.

32:55.725 --> 32:58.895
We don't know if any of the rest of you
are infected,

32:59.020 --> 33:00.647
but we will soon.

33:00.730 --> 33:01.856
Even so,

33:01.939 --> 33:05.401
the Inhumans cannot encounter Hive.

33:05.526 --> 33:09.572
For the time being,
I have to keep you in quarantine.

33:09.697 --> 33:12.075
I have to disband your team, Daisy.

33:12.200 --> 33:13.701
I'm sorry.

33:20.416 --> 33:22.168
We'll be stronger next time.

33:23.878 --> 33:25.046
You'll see.

33:27.256 --> 33:28.591
Temperature differential?

33:28.716 --> 33:29.842
Too similar.

33:29.926 --> 33:30.927
Brain biopsy?

33:31.052 --> 33:33.179
Too lethal. Dopamine levels?

33:34.514 --> 33:35.556
You think it drugs them?

33:36.265 --> 33:38.518
I have no idea
how to help them.

33:38.601 --> 33:40.603
We should be in the lab.

33:40.728 --> 33:43.564
Well, we're running
every test that we can.

33:44.774 --> 33:48.778
One of these days, we'll find something
out in space that's magnificent, right?

33:49.445 --> 33:52.281
Not trying to infect us
or kill us like Hive.

33:54.200 --> 33:55.410
What's Hive?

33:56.411 --> 33:58.621
Couldn't even get off
a desert planet without us, so...

33:59.288 --> 34:00.623
We'll sort him out.

34:03.376 --> 34:05.628
I just want to help our friends.

34:09.215 --> 34:10.257
I know.

34:30.987 --> 34:32.071
Sorry.

34:32.155 --> 34:33.156
Uh...

34:33.322 --> 34:35.408
Sorry. I know everything with Will and...

34:35.992 --> 34:37.409
Starting over.
I didn't mean to push too fast.

34:37.493 --> 34:38.828
Too fast?

34:39.661 --> 34:42.165
Fitz, it's been 10 years.

34:43.916 --> 34:45.668
We can't waste any more time.

34:46.585 --> 34:47.754
Really?

34:47.837 --> 34:48.838
'Cause I thought that...

34:48.963 --> 34:51.674
Really. And since we're cursed
or whatever nonsense...

34:51.799 --> 34:53.009
I said that one time.

34:53.134 --> 34:54.260
Well, and you and your
fourth-dimension idea...

34:54.342 --> 34:56.512
- And for the record, actually...
- ...that we can't change fate...

34:56.596 --> 34:58.264
...today is more evidence
that the cosmos is against us.

34:58.347 --> 35:01.100
I'm tired of seeing our friends
ripped apart from each other.

35:01.184 --> 35:04.020
That can't happen to us again.
I won't let it.

35:05.521 --> 35:07.023
Then we won't let it.

35:08.775 --> 35:10.318
Who needs space?

35:11.694 --> 35:15.656
'Cause I've got something
magnificent right here.

35:20.495 --> 35:22.205
A picture of space.

35:23.498 --> 35:25.208
One of my prized possessions, that is.

35:25.333 --> 35:26.709
I don't know why it makes
any significance to...

35:26.834 --> 35:27.877
Mmm-hmm.

35:42.642 --> 35:43.893
I had to see you.

35:43.976 --> 35:46.229
Daisy. I didn't do anything. I...

35:46.729 --> 35:47.897
I promise.

35:47.980 --> 35:49.649
I did not betray the team.

35:49.732 --> 35:51.400
I believe you.

35:51.526 --> 35:53.736
I believe you. That's why I came.
I came to get you out of here.

35:53.820 --> 35:54.904
What?

35:56.239 --> 35:57.365
Are you serious?

35:58.407 --> 35:59.909
We could just walk right out of here.

36:02.745 --> 36:03.913
They wouldn't understand.

36:03.996 --> 36:05.581
I don't care.

36:05.665 --> 36:06.833
We can be together.

36:07.333 --> 36:08.918
We can't just throw S.H.I.E.L.D. away.

36:09.001 --> 36:11.546
They'll find a test
and see that I'm innocent.

36:12.421 --> 36:13.840
How did you get out of your cell?

36:14.924 --> 36:17.051
I'm the one who programmed
the security features.

36:18.261 --> 36:20.721
Lincoln, S.H.I.E.L.D. can't hold us.

36:21.389 --> 36:23.099
But we want them to, right?

36:25.601 --> 36:26.602
Daisy.

36:28.187 --> 36:29.438
What did you do?

36:32.024 --> 36:33.276
<i>I've got Malick.</i>

36:46.080 --> 36:47.915
I have to get back to the base.

36:49.458 --> 36:50.877
They have something we need.

36:51.627 --> 36:52.795
Do it.

36:58.759 --> 36:59.969
Guys,

37:00.052 --> 37:01.470
I'm coming to you.

37:08.477 --> 37:09.645
So...

37:09.770 --> 37:13.149
This is what Hive's sway looks like.

37:14.942 --> 37:17.236
Daisy, he's using you!

37:17.320 --> 37:18.654
You're... You're sick.

37:18.738 --> 37:20.323
No.

37:20.448 --> 37:22.116
I'm happier than I've ever been.

37:22.825 --> 37:24.076
You get it.

37:24.160 --> 37:26.245
You've felt an emptiness
your entire life, like me.

37:26.329 --> 37:27.997
We've tried to fill it,
but it never works.

37:28.497 --> 37:29.957
I found the answer,

37:30.833 --> 37:32.168
and it's beautiful.

37:32.627 --> 37:33.669
It's...

37:34.337 --> 37:35.421
It's...

37:35.504 --> 37:36.672
It's a bond.

37:37.006 --> 37:38.090
Beautiful?

37:38.174 --> 37:39.759
Daisy, people are dying!

37:40.635 --> 37:41.928
Malick?

37:55.858 --> 37:57.109
So, it's you.

37:58.027 --> 38:00.363
I was curious who Hive would send.

38:02.198 --> 38:03.616
I know what you're gonna do.

38:04.200 --> 38:06.035
We can't let you keep talking.

38:07.495 --> 38:09.372
And I won't be kept from my daughter.

38:09.705 --> 38:11.165
If I'm honest,

38:12.124 --> 38:13.542
I might enjoy this.

38:35.982 --> 38:37.858
Malick doesn't matter.

38:38.317 --> 38:39.819
He could only hurt us.

38:39.902 --> 38:41.070
What we are trying to build...

38:41.195 --> 38:42.822
Do I matter that little to you?

38:42.905 --> 38:44.573
No, I care about you! I...

38:44.699 --> 38:46.826
The Daisy I know
wouldn't betray S.H.I.E.L.D.,

38:46.909 --> 38:48.995
wouldn't throw away what we have!

38:51.414 --> 38:52.498
You framed me.

38:52.581 --> 38:53.666
I'm sorry.

38:53.749 --> 38:56.419
But Coulson had to find his rat
so S.H.I.E.L.D. could stand down.

38:56.502 --> 38:58.546
And you have trouble
keeping your temper.

38:58.921 --> 39:00.423
Really?

39:00.506 --> 39:01.882
But I'm not throwing you away.

39:03.718 --> 39:05.594
You... You...

39:05.678 --> 39:08.180
You used that against me?

39:08.264 --> 39:09.765
I'm here for you now!

39:13.227 --> 39:14.270
We care about you.

39:16.272 --> 39:18.607
We could have all of it together.

39:18.733 --> 39:20.067
No.

39:20.943 --> 39:22.528
I don't want any part of this.

39:28.242 --> 39:30.077
You'll understand someday.

39:37.543 --> 39:38.794
Daisy!

41:39.665 --> 41:41.292
Preparations have been made to leave.

41:41.375 --> 41:42.585
We need somewhere safe.

41:42.835 --> 41:47.006
With what we did to his daughter,
I worry Malick will turn on HYDRA.

41:47.089 --> 41:48.841
That won't be a problem.

41:48.924 --> 41:50.217
Gideon is dead.

41:51.051 --> 41:52.386
HYDRA's evolved.

41:53.637 --> 41:56.182
In that case,
there is the issue of his estate.

41:56.265 --> 41:58.058
I'm aware of his wealth.
I'm not concerned.

41:59.226 --> 42:00.561
We find Skye next.

42:00.978 --> 42:02.188
I believe I know where she's headed.

42:02.271 --> 42:03.314
Of course.

42:04.565 --> 42:07.902
But there is a considerable portion
available to move now.

42:07.985 --> 42:09.236
- How much?
- Roughly,

42:09.320 --> 42:12.156
$960 million.

42:12.698 --> 42:13.741
Hmm.

42:15.534 --> 42:19.205
Malick built something
very impressive with his life.

42:22.499 --> 42:24.126
Let's spend it.
