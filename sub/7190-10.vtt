00:02.210 --> 00:03.586
- Wait. You have
Maddie's powers?

00:03.670 --> 00:06.756
- [stammering]

00:06.840 --> 00:07.841
- You have to tell her!

00:07.924 --> 00:09.467
She thinks I took her powers.

00:09.551 --> 00:11.094
- She does?

00:11.177 --> 00:13.930
Oh, well, maybe we could
just go with that then.

00:14.013 --> 00:17.559
- No! You have to tell
Maddie, or I will.

00:17.642 --> 00:20.019
- No.
No, you can't tell her.

00:20.103 --> 00:21.229
She'll hate me.

00:24.274 --> 00:25.233
- Seriously?

00:25.316 --> 00:27.444
You know I can still walk.

00:27.527 --> 00:28.153
- I can fix that.

00:33.366 --> 00:36.286
- Oh, no, she's lost
her magical mind!

00:36.369 --> 00:39.080
- No!

00:39.164 --> 00:41.249
Nobody is going anywhere!

00:42.667 --> 00:44.461
You--no.

00:44.544 --> 00:45.462
Come back here.
- Who knows what else she'll do!

00:45.545 --> 00:47.422
Stick her hands together
like glue.

00:52.552 --> 00:54.637
- What?

00:54.721 --> 00:56.639
What's going on in here?

00:56.723 --> 00:58.641
Did I just see you--

00:58.725 --> 01:01.728
- Maddie Winky,
it's not what you think.

01:01.811 --> 01:03.563
- You have my powers?

01:03.646 --> 01:06.399
- [gasps] I do?

01:07.776 --> 01:09.694
Oh, all right, I do.

01:09.778 --> 01:12.322
I have your powers.

01:12.405 --> 01:13.448
Happy?

[mouthing]

01:58.743 --> 02:01.204
- Whoa, cool!

02:01.287 --> 02:02.580
How'd you do that?

02:02.664 --> 02:04.040
- I mouthed the words.

02:04.123 --> 02:06.209
Sometimes I don't
even need words.

02:06.292 --> 02:07.752
- Like when you're
in a magic fight?

02:07.836 --> 02:09.211
Do something else.

02:19.848 --> 02:20.723
[door opens]
- Daniel!

02:20.807 --> 02:21.766
- Hey, Em.

02:21.850 --> 02:23.309
Hey, Andi.

02:23.393 --> 02:24.894
What are you doing?

02:30.733 --> 02:34.070
- What, you've never seen an
exploding milk carton before?

02:34.153 --> 02:35.405
- No.

02:35.488 --> 02:36.531
I mean, yes, but--

02:36.614 --> 02:37.282
- Great, now can
you get me a mop?

02:37.365 --> 02:39.117
It's in the hall closet.

02:40.159 --> 02:41.786
- [mouthing words]
Thank you.

02:49.168 --> 02:53.256
- I was just safe-keeping
your powers for you

02:53.339 --> 02:57.010
until you were older
and--and--and more responsible.

02:57.093 --> 02:59.846
- I'm the one
who's not responsible?

02:59.929 --> 03:02.765
You turned my BFF
into a wind-up doll.

03:02.849 --> 03:07.896
- Plus--plus, I can protect you
from dangerous witches

03:07.979 --> 03:09.522
who might come after you.

03:09.606 --> 03:12.942
- What are they going to do?
Try and steal my powers?

03:13.026 --> 03:15.236
- Yes!
- You already did that!

03:15.320 --> 03:17.488
You're the dangerous witch!

03:17.572 --> 03:19.657
- Wow, walked
right into that one.

03:19.741 --> 03:21.117
- Powers, please.

03:21.200 --> 03:25.163
- It's not that simple,
Maddie.

03:25.246 --> 03:27.916
We would need a conduit
to transfer the powers.

03:27.999 --> 03:29.292
- Then let's go get one.

03:29.375 --> 03:30.835
- Excuse me?

03:34.005 --> 03:35.340
- Sorry.

03:35.423 --> 03:38.468
- What happened to controlling
the impulsive spell casting

03:38.551 --> 03:39.594
like I taught you?

03:39.677 --> 03:41.638
- Sometimes I just
can't fight it.

03:41.721 --> 03:43.306
Or when it's really important.

03:43.389 --> 03:45.183
- [laughs] Yeah, getting past
someone in the hall,

03:45.266 --> 03:47.101
now that's
an important situation.

03:47.185 --> 03:49.395
- It is to me.

03:49.479 --> 03:50.521
I can't wait for this
Fool Moon to be over.

03:50.605 --> 03:53.983
- We just need to
get by two more weeks.

03:54.067 --> 03:55.276
- We?

03:55.360 --> 03:57.111
Is--is something
happening to you?

03:57.195 --> 04:01.783
- No, it's--it's nothing.

04:01.866 --> 04:02.659
- Jax, what's going on?

04:02.742 --> 04:04.744
You can tell me.

04:04.827 --> 04:08.665
- It's, uh--it's just...
bad.

04:08.748 --> 04:12.460
- As bad as when I "ah..."

04:12.543 --> 04:14.170
"oh, yeah."

04:14.253 --> 04:16.673
- It's nothing as bad
as your "ah,"

04:16.755 --> 04:18.882
"oh, yeah."

04:18.966 --> 04:21.844
But it's still pretty bad.

04:21.928 --> 04:24.847
And I can't talk
to you about it here.

04:24.931 --> 04:27.934
But if we go to, say,
the beach,

04:28.017 --> 04:29.644
maybe I could show you.

04:29.727 --> 04:30.853
- Jax, we can't.

04:30.937 --> 04:33.147
We've got school.

04:33.231 --> 04:35.149
- I--I don't know if I can go
through the whole day

04:35.233 --> 04:37.193
without something bad happening.

04:37.276 --> 04:39.362
Come on now, I don't think
anyone's gonna notice.

04:39.445 --> 04:42.573
- Um, hello,
my dad's the principal.

04:44.075 --> 04:45.368
- It's okay.
I'll just figure it out myself.

04:47.787 --> 04:49.414
- Wait.

04:49.497 --> 04:51.165
If we can make it back
before last period,

04:51.249 --> 04:53.584
I think it'll be okay.

04:53.668 --> 04:55.378
- I can't make you do that.
- I want to.

04:55.461 --> 04:59.465
You helped me with my thing.
I'll help you with yours.

04:59.549 --> 05:01.217
- Hey, Jax.

05:01.300 --> 05:03.803
You won't believe what
your dad's making me do.

05:03.886 --> 05:05.388
Audition for the school play.

05:05.471 --> 05:07.682
- He is?
Why?

05:07.765 --> 05:09.058
- Well, it's either that
or a month of detention

05:09.142 --> 05:09.892
for breaking the trophy case.

05:09.976 --> 05:11.894
- What's the play?

05:11.978 --> 05:13.229
- "Romeo and Juliet."

05:13.312 --> 05:15.815
- [laughs]
Oh, man, how lame.

05:15.898 --> 05:17.942
- Cool! And you're
auditioning for Romeo?

05:18.026 --> 05:19.402
How romantic.

05:19.485 --> 05:22.405
- Let's just hope
your dad's impressed.

05:22.488 --> 05:24.407
He's the one holding
the auditions.

05:24.490 --> 05:26.200
- Good luck.
I mean, break a leg.

05:26.284 --> 05:28.327
- I don't wanna break a leg.

05:28.411 --> 05:30.079
I wanna break
the 200 freestyle record.

05:30.163 --> 05:31.831
- It's a theater term.

05:31.914 --> 05:34.083
It means good luck.

05:34.167 --> 05:35.752
- Oh, well, that I need.

05:35.835 --> 05:38.254
I better hurry.

05:39.589 --> 05:40.840
See ya at practice.

05:42.175 --> 05:44.343
- Okay, let's go.
- [phone beeping]

05:44.427 --> 05:46.679
Uh-oh, it's Andi.

05:46.763 --> 05:48.097
It says it's urgent.

05:48.181 --> 05:49.432
- Of course it is.

05:49.515 --> 05:51.392
- I'll be right back.

05:51.476 --> 05:54.270
Hey, I should see
if she wants to come.

05:54.353 --> 05:56.397
- Ha ha. Yeah.

05:56.481 --> 05:58.608
Yay.

05:58.691 --> 06:01.778
- So your mom had
your powers this whole time?

06:01.861 --> 06:03.446
- Yeah.
She even tried to

06:03.529 --> 06:05.782
get me to think that some
random witch far away

06:05.865 --> 06:09.577
had them in some
made-up country--Ecuador.

06:09.660 --> 06:13.081
- [laughs] Um, actually
that's real coun--

06:13.164 --> 06:14.957
oh, oh, did you say Ecuador?

06:15.041 --> 06:17.627
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
totally made up.

06:17.710 --> 06:19.754
You knew
and didn't say anything?

06:19.837 --> 06:21.798
I'm surprised you
didn't punish her.

06:21.881 --> 06:23.174
- Why do you think
she's carrying

06:23.257 --> 06:24.592
my travel makeup kit around?

06:24.675 --> 06:26.302
- But Katie's carrying it too.

06:26.385 --> 06:27.512
- They know the rules.

06:27.595 --> 06:29.514
- If one of us keeps
a secret from Maddie--

06:29.597 --> 06:31.349
- --both of us get punished.

06:32.767 --> 06:34.936
- I'm so sorry.

06:35.019 --> 06:37.146
- Be sorry later and
help me carry this thing.

06:37.230 --> 06:40.483
- So how is your mom going
to give them back to you?

06:40.566 --> 06:44.654
- We have to do
a transfer using a--a--

06:44.737 --> 06:47.281
- Conduit? Like what the
principal tried to do?

06:47.365 --> 06:49.283
- Yeah, that.
- Oh, man,

06:49.367 --> 06:51.494
I'm glad it's you
doing this power transfer

06:51.577 --> 06:53.996
and not some crazy witch who
would use me as a conduit

06:54.080 --> 06:56.582
and disintegrate me
into a pile of dust.

06:58.751 --> 06:59.836
- Yep.

06:59.919 --> 07:02.296
Lucky you.

07:02.380 --> 07:03.047
- What are you doing now?

07:03.131 --> 07:05.675
- I'm going to class.

07:05.758 --> 07:10.721
- How about you come to the
beach with me and Jax instead?

07:10.805 --> 07:12.390
- Oh, I can't.

07:12.473 --> 07:14.642
I have an oral presentation
in French class.

07:14.725 --> 07:17.478
- Your presentation
is about croissants?

07:17.562 --> 07:20.231
- No, but I'm hoping everyone
will be too distracted

07:20.314 --> 07:22.191
eating them and not notice
my presentation is muy mal.

07:22.275 --> 07:23.317
- That's Spanish.

07:23.401 --> 07:26.988
- Like I said,
I need to distract them.

07:29.448 --> 07:31.742
- How are we gonna
get out of here?

07:31.826 --> 07:33.161
- We'll teletransport.

07:33.244 --> 07:34.328
- I can't.

07:34.412 --> 07:37.248
Me, teletransporting,
the pool, remember?

07:37.331 --> 07:38.958
- Fine. You're just
gonna have to do it

07:39.041 --> 07:41.711
the old-fashioned way.
Sneak out.

07:41.794 --> 07:45.756
- All right, I guess I'll meet
you by lifeguard tower 21.

07:45.840 --> 07:47.383
- See you there.

07:57.727 --> 07:59.812
- Welcome to the Iridium High
play auditions.

07:59.896 --> 08:02.315
I am your director
Francisco Alonso,

08:02.398 --> 08:04.525
because no other teacher
wanted to do it.

08:07.069 --> 08:08.779
- It is the east,
and Juliet is the--

08:08.863 --> 08:10.740
- Louder!

08:10.823 --> 08:13.492
- It is the east,
and Juliet is the sun!

08:14.827 --> 08:18.164
- See how she leans
her cheek upon her hand!

08:19.165 --> 08:22.168
- R-O-M-I-O, Romeo.

08:22.251 --> 08:24.503
Did I get it right?

08:29.926 --> 08:33.221
- Okay, now for Juliet.

08:33.304 --> 08:38.267
- [softly] Oh, Romeo,
Romeo, wherefore art thou--

08:38.351 --> 08:39.809
art thou, Romeo?

08:40.477 --> 08:44.774
- Um, thou, Romeo--

08:44.857 --> 08:46.651
um, Daniel's gonna be Romeo,
right?

08:50.529 --> 08:54.617
- Deny thy father
and refuse thy name.

08:54.700 --> 08:57.787
[crying]

09:00.289 --> 09:02.625
- Oh, Romeo, Romeo.

09:02.708 --> 09:05.044
Wherefore art thou, Romeo?

09:05.127 --> 09:06.754
Deny thy father
and refuse thy name.

09:09.215 --> 09:11.467
A thousand times, good night.

09:11.550 --> 09:13.844
- Thank you, Sophie,
thank you, that'll do it.

09:13.928 --> 09:16.430
- What says he of our marriage?
What of that?

09:18.015 --> 09:19.767
Love give me strength.

09:22.103 --> 09:24.981
And let me die.

09:25.064 --> 09:26.983
[crying]

09:27.066 --> 09:29.694
So did I get the part?

09:33.531 --> 09:35.157
- Okay, show me
what the problem is.

09:35.241 --> 09:39.161
- Ugh, well, uh--

09:42.164 --> 09:43.833
- So?

09:43.916 --> 09:44.709
- It's not just that.

09:48.421 --> 09:50.339
- Why is that a problem?

09:50.423 --> 09:52.508
- The problem is--

09:55.886 --> 09:57.388
- Ah!

09:57.471 --> 09:59.432
Jax!

09:59.515 --> 10:01.976
- The problem is is you're
still not having enough fun

10:02.059 --> 10:03.728
with your powers.

10:03.811 --> 10:04.729
[laughs]

10:04.812 --> 10:07.231
- You're right.
I'm not.

10:10.568 --> 10:11.110
But who needs magic
for a food fight?

10:11.193 --> 10:13.529
- Ha ha ho ho ho.

10:13.612 --> 10:15.072
It's on.

10:22.330 --> 10:23.497
- Do you want your
favorite lip gloss, Maddie?

10:23.581 --> 10:24.707
- Or your favorite smoothie?

10:24.790 --> 10:26.042
- Do you hear
an annoying buzzing sound?

10:26.125 --> 10:27.168
- No.

10:27.251 --> 10:28.794
- Oh, I do.

10:28.878 --> 10:30.254
It's probably just
all the squirrels running

10:30.338 --> 10:33.549
inside the walls.

10:33.632 --> 10:35.134
Get out of there, squirrels!

10:35.217 --> 10:38.012
You're annoying Maddie!

10:38.095 --> 10:39.972
Problem solved.

10:41.140 --> 10:42.767
- I gotta get to class.

10:42.850 --> 10:45.227
See you--and only you--

10:45.311 --> 10:47.772
at lunch.

10:47.855 --> 10:50.107
- Quick, now that he's alone.

10:53.444 --> 10:56.197
- You're not gonna tie me up
with a jump rope again, are you?

10:56.280 --> 10:59.325
- Us?
Why would we ever do that?

10:59.408 --> 11:01.869
- Because you just did
a couple of days ago.

11:01.952 --> 11:06.165
- We just want to have
a little chat--a chit-chat,

11:06.248 --> 11:08.501
a mini chit-chat.
A teeny-weeny--

11:08.584 --> 11:11.045
- I got it.

11:11.128 --> 11:12.380
About what?

11:12.463 --> 11:14.423
- Being the conduit to transfer
Maddie's powers to her.

11:14.507 --> 11:16.967
- And turn into a pile of dust?

11:17.051 --> 11:18.219
I don't think so.

11:18.302 --> 11:19.595
- But you won't disintegrate.

11:19.678 --> 11:21.347
We've found a way
to protect you.

11:21.430 --> 11:23.099
- We did?
- Yes!

11:23.182 --> 11:27.812
It was that old book
we found in Maddie's basement,

11:27.895 --> 11:29.814
remember?
- Oh, yeah,

11:29.897 --> 11:36.445
the super old book published
way back in 1997.

11:36.529 --> 11:37.405
- I don't know, guys.

11:37.488 --> 11:39.073
- Think about it.

11:39.156 --> 11:42.451
You've been trying to
impress Maddie for weeks.

11:42.535 --> 11:44.078
This could be
the ultimate grand gesture.

11:44.161 --> 11:48.040
- Sorry, guys, even if it's
the ultimate grand gesture,

11:48.124 --> 11:51.502
it's all for nothing if I turn
into a pile of dust.

11:51.585 --> 11:53.129
- Come on!

11:53.212 --> 11:55.256
Where's your sense of romance?

11:56.173 --> 11:57.883
- Alonso, Emma?

11:57.967 --> 12:00.845
- That's weird.
I walked to school with Emma,

12:00.928 --> 12:02.388
and I saw her
after first period.

12:02.471 --> 12:03.848
- Are you sure you weren't
sleepwalking

12:03.931 --> 12:05.808
and dreaming that Emma
was with you?

12:05.891 --> 12:08.477
- Yes, I'm sure.
Who sleepwalks in school?

12:08.561 --> 12:09.395
- It happens.

12:09.478 --> 12:11.564
- Miller, Daniel?
- Here.

12:11.647 --> 12:12.982
- Novoa, Jax?

12:13.065 --> 12:15.067
- Here.

12:15.151 --> 12:16.861
- [laughing]

12:23.868 --> 12:27.621
- I think we're in the clear.
I'm gonna go to class.

12:27.705 --> 12:29.081
<i>- FRANCISCO:</i>
<i>Emma Alonso?</i>

12:29.165 --> 12:30.750
- Dad?

12:30.833 --> 12:34.170
<i>- Emma Alonso,</i>
<i>to the principal's office now.</i>

12:34.253 --> 12:37.756
- Oh, no, this is gonna be bad.

12:43.929 --> 12:45.723
- Hey, Gigi.
- Hi, Jax.

12:46.599 --> 12:48.476
- Hey, Gigi.
- Hi, Jax.

12:50.811 --> 12:55.691
I just had the weirdest
déjà vu.

12:55.774 --> 12:57.026
- Dad, I can explain.

12:57.109 --> 12:58.360
- Ah, no.

12:58.444 --> 13:01.030
It's Principal Alonso in here.

13:01.113 --> 13:02.865
- It's not what it looks like.

13:02.948 --> 13:07.369
- What it looks like is that
you cut five classes in a row.

13:07.453 --> 13:08.787
- But I had a good reason.

13:08.871 --> 13:09.788
- It doesn't matter
what the reason is.

13:09.872 --> 13:12.708
You cut class,
you pay the price.

13:12.791 --> 13:15.503
- So you're punishing us?

13:15.586 --> 13:17.546
- Us?
Who's us?

13:17.630 --> 13:21.967
- Me and--uh, the other
students on your list?

13:22.051 --> 13:24.929
- You are the only one today.

13:25.012 --> 13:26.847
- What?
How is that possible?

13:26.931 --> 13:29.767
- Oh, I know, I know.
It's so confusing.

13:29.850 --> 13:33.854
Look, let me explain.
You see...

13:33.938 --> 13:37.191
All the other
students went to class today.

13:37.274 --> 13:38.734
You didn't!

13:38.817 --> 13:39.944
- I--

13:40.027 --> 13:41.695
- Look, detention five days.

13:41.779 --> 13:44.114
One per every class you skipped.

13:44.198 --> 13:46.200
- No, no, no.
- Yes, yes, yes.

13:49.286 --> 13:51.205
- Emma?

13:51.288 --> 13:52.665
Where have you been?

13:52.748 --> 13:56.877
- I--it's a long story.

13:56.961 --> 13:57.962
- What happened?

13:58.045 --> 13:59.505
Are you okay?
- What do you mean?

13:59.588 --> 14:01.924
- You look like you just got
attacked by a food court.

14:02.007 --> 14:03.259
- Oh, yeah.

14:03.342 --> 14:05.094
Also a long story.

14:06.345 --> 14:07.638
- I texted you
a bunch of times,

14:07.721 --> 14:09.682
but I never heard back.
I was worried.

14:09.765 --> 14:11.141
- I'm okay, really.

14:11.225 --> 14:15.437
Except I've got--no,
I can't even say it.

14:15.521 --> 14:17.064
- What?

14:17.147 --> 14:18.857
- Det--detent--

14:18.941 --> 14:20.401
- Detention?
- Yes.

14:20.484 --> 14:23.279
And I've never
had detention before.

14:23.362 --> 14:24.947
I'm a goody two-shoes.

14:25.030 --> 14:26.115
- It's okay.

14:26.198 --> 14:29.201
You'll be okay, just--
be on time.

14:29.285 --> 14:31.203
And bring some
juice to stay hydrated.

14:31.287 --> 14:32.788
Oh, and don't sit next to Gigi.

14:32.871 --> 14:34.081
She only wants to gossip.

14:34.164 --> 14:35.624
- I don't know if
I'm gonna make it.

14:35.708 --> 14:36.959
- You will.

14:37.042 --> 14:39.128
I wish I had detention so
I could keep you company.

14:39.211 --> 14:40.337
- Me, too.

14:40.421 --> 14:41.964
Not that I want you to
be in trouble, it just--

14:42.047 --> 14:43.799
- I know what you mean.

14:43.882 --> 14:45.092
Look, go clean up.

14:45.175 --> 14:46.427
You don't wanna be late.

14:48.304 --> 14:50.097
- [sighs]

15:01.817 --> 15:03.110
- I know, detention.

15:10.200 --> 15:11.452
- Oh!

15:11.535 --> 15:14.455
Phew, saved some.

15:14.538 --> 15:16.498
Wait,
there's mascara on them.

15:17.708 --> 15:21.211
Oh, uh, are you okay?

15:22.546 --> 15:25.090
Are--are you crying?

15:28.636 --> 15:31.096
Hey, that's the...

15:31.764 --> 15:34.767
Janitor's closet.

15:48.322 --> 15:49.448
- Thanks.

15:55.454 --> 15:57.956
- Croissant?

16:01.335 --> 16:05.923
- I--[sighs]--just...

16:07.466 --> 16:12.471
<i>Ever since I lost my powers,</i>
<i>things have been awful.</i>

16:12.554 --> 16:17.059
Now I find out that my mom's
had my powers this whole time.

16:17.142 --> 16:20.229
My best friends kept
it a secret from me.

16:20.312 --> 16:23.941
Now I have to find a condominium
to get my powers back.

16:24.024 --> 16:26.026
- [mouthing]
Condominium?

16:26.110 --> 16:29.321
- It's like I don't even know my
mom or my best friends anymore.

16:29.405 --> 16:33.242
<i>I don't even know</i>
<i>who I am anymore.</i>

16:33.325 --> 16:35.160
<i>[crying]</i>

16:35.244 --> 16:37.705
- You're--

16:37.788 --> 16:39.081
you're Maddie Van Pelt.

16:39.164 --> 16:42.793
Head Panther,
head smoothie drinker,

16:42.876 --> 16:44.586
head intimidator
of Iridium High.

16:44.670 --> 16:46.797
- No, I'm not.

16:46.880 --> 16:48.257
- Of course you are.

16:48.340 --> 16:51.218
Even if you don't feel the same,
everyone else in school

16:51.301 --> 16:53.429
still sees you
as the same old Maddie.

16:53.512 --> 16:55.264
- They do?
- Yeah.

16:55.347 --> 16:56.932
Why do you think they all
run away from you

16:57.015 --> 16:58.350
when you come by?

16:58.434 --> 17:01.270
- They do still run away.
- See?

17:01.353 --> 17:03.897
Now get out there and go ruin
someone's day

17:03.981 --> 17:06.400
like the Maddie Van Pelt
you are.

17:06.483 --> 17:09.653
- [sighs] I will.

17:11.113 --> 17:14.116
BOTH: You better not
tell anybody about this.

17:14.199 --> 17:15.409
- Deal.
- Deal.

17:20.622 --> 17:22.290
- Alonso, Emma?

17:22.374 --> 17:23.876
- Here.

17:23.959 --> 17:27.921
- Never thought
I'd see the day.

17:28.005 --> 17:31.592
- Nice to see you,
too, Principal Alonso.

17:31.675 --> 17:33.469
- Yeah, that's enough
backtalk, Miss Alonso.

17:33.552 --> 17:35.971
Miller, Daniel?

17:36.054 --> 17:37.806
- Here.

17:37.890 --> 17:40.225
- Late as usual.
- Yeah, but--

17:40.309 --> 17:42.311
I'll sit.

17:42.394 --> 17:43.645
- I thought you got
out of detention

17:43.729 --> 17:46.231
by doing the school play.

17:46.315 --> 17:49.318
- Yeah, but I couldn't let
you face detention all alone.

17:49.401 --> 17:51.028
- Aw!

17:52.237 --> 17:55.199
- Hey, Maddie,
I brought you a surprise.

17:55.282 --> 17:57.409
- I'm not in the mood
for surprises.

17:58.660 --> 18:00.621
Especially this one!

18:02.331 --> 18:04.249
- Come on, guys.

18:04.333 --> 18:06.001
You wanna get back on
Maddie's good side, right?

18:06.085 --> 18:08.003
- Yeah, but we don't know how.

18:08.086 --> 18:09.171
- You're sure
the plastic wrap

18:09.254 --> 18:09.963
will protect me
during the transfer?

18:10.047 --> 18:11.465
- The what?
- Yes!

18:11.548 --> 18:13.550
For sure.

18:13.634 --> 18:15.010
Why not?

18:15.093 --> 18:16.553
- Okay then, tell her.

18:18.096 --> 18:20.432
- Maddie, Maddie, I convinced
Diego to be your proxy.

18:20.516 --> 18:21.934
You're getting your powers back.

18:22.017 --> 18:23.894
- What?
You did?

18:23.977 --> 18:24.978
- We did.

18:25.062 --> 18:27.481
- [cheering]
- They sure did.

18:27.564 --> 18:30.150
Plus they found a way to do
it so I won't disintegrate.

18:30.234 --> 18:31.360
- How?

18:34.780 --> 18:37.032
- Oh, hey, beach buddy.

18:37.115 --> 18:39.409
- Don't "hey, beach buddy" me.

18:39.493 --> 18:42.079
I got busted for skipping
school, and you didn't.

18:42.162 --> 18:44.915
- Oh, that.
I can teach you if you want.

18:44.998 --> 18:48.544
- No, I don't want you
to teach me anything else.

18:48.627 --> 18:50.504
I have to go.
Daniel's waiting for me.

18:52.381 --> 18:53.924
Hi, Daniel.
Sorry I'm late.

18:54.007 --> 18:55.300
I was helping Andi with her

18:55.384 --> 19:00.222
ninja star shelter of apocalypse
or something.

19:00.305 --> 19:01.723
- I don't know how her
parents get her that stuff.

19:01.807 --> 19:06.895
- Seriously, have you seen the
stuff your parents get the T3?

19:06.979 --> 19:08.897
How's the line memorizing going?

19:08.981 --> 19:11.024
- Your dad made me understudy
all the other parts.

19:11.108 --> 19:13.068
So I have to memorize
the entire play.

19:13.151 --> 19:15.779
And if I mess up at all,
the detention deal's off.

19:15.863 --> 19:17.239
- Sounds like my dad.

19:17.322 --> 19:19.825
- So I'll be studying
lines all night.

19:19.908 --> 19:21.577
- I can't stay much longer.

19:21.660 --> 19:24.246
Dad Alonso grounded me,
and I can't be out past 6.

19:24.329 --> 19:25.414
- That's okay.

19:25.497 --> 19:26.748
We can get through

19:26.832 --> 19:28.792
.005% of the lines by then.

19:30.210 --> 19:32.504
I'll go get us some drinks.
- Okay.

19:35.841 --> 19:38.635
{\an8}My dad's punishing Daniel
harshly because of me.

19:38.719 --> 19:40.304
{\an8}I wish I could help him
learn his lines instantly.

19:47.936 --> 19:49.646
<i>- DANIEL'S VOICE:</i>
<i>By a name I know not</i>

19:49.730 --> 19:51.398
<i>how to tell thee who I am.</i>

19:51.481 --> 19:54.151
<i>My name, dear saint,</i>
<i>is hateful to myself.</i>

19:54.234 --> 19:55.444
<i>Because it is an enemy to thee.</i>

19:55.527 --> 19:58.780
<i>Neither, fair saint,</i>
<i>if either they dislike.</i>

19:58.864 --> 20:01.450
<i>With love's light wings</i>
<i>did I perch these walls.</i>

20:01.533 --> 20:03.619
<i>For stony limits</i>
<i>cannot hold love out.</i>

20:03.702 --> 20:06.163
<i>And what love can do,</i>
<i>that dares love attempt.</i>

20:06.246 --> 20:09.291
<i>Therefore thy kinsmen</i>
<i>are no stop to me.</i>

20:11.877 --> 20:15.005
- And that should do it.

20:15.088 --> 20:16.256
- Whoo, me next!

20:17.716 --> 20:20.802
- Mm, what are you doing?

20:20.886 --> 20:21.803
- Diego offered to be
our condominium

20:21.887 --> 20:24.640
for our power transfer.

20:24.723 --> 20:26.308
- He did?
- Mm-hmm.

20:26.391 --> 20:29.311
- Yes.
So no more excuses.

20:29.394 --> 20:32.189
We're doing this, right now.

20:32.272 --> 20:36.652
- But--but I--oh, all right.

20:40.656 --> 20:42.783
Well, you're looking
awful chipper,

20:42.866 --> 20:44.242
considering
what's about to happen.

20:44.326 --> 20:45.869
- Anything for Maddie.

20:45.953 --> 20:47.663
- Okay.

20:47.746 --> 20:50.624
Uh, let's get this
show on the road.

20:53.543 --> 20:56.838
Okay, Maddie Winky,
you take his other arm.

20:56.922 --> 20:59.883
And we'll...begin the transfer.

21:02.427 --> 21:05.472
- No, I can't.
It's cheating.

21:12.604 --> 21:13.313
[knocking at door]

21:18.151 --> 21:19.736
- What do you want?

21:19.820 --> 21:22.698
- We didn't get to finish
our conversation earlier.

21:22.781 --> 21:24.491
- I'm pretty sure we did.

21:24.574 --> 21:26.201
- But I was going to show you
how I was able to go to

21:26.284 --> 21:28.578
the beach and not get in trouble
for skipping school today.

21:28.662 --> 21:29.663
- Not interes--

21:31.456 --> 21:32.666
Fine, show me.

21:33.875 --> 21:36.378
- So many places to go,
people to see,

21:36.461 --> 21:39.715
