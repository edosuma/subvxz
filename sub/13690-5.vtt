00:22.700 --> 00:24.619
MAN ON RADIO:
Clear, bright and cool

00:24.703 --> 00:27.956
with an average temperature
for the area of 15 degrees.

00:28.039 --> 00:31.502
# West Highland Radio #

00:31.585 --> 00:34.171
-Katrina, hi.
-You're up bright and early.

00:34.255 --> 00:36.633
-Yeah, I know.
I had work to do so...
-Work?

00:36.717 --> 00:39.386
You still haven't
grasped the concept
of being a laird, have you?

00:39.469 --> 00:42.265
I suppose if I was
a school teacher,
I could knock off at 3:00.

00:42.348 --> 00:43.850
Were you looking for a fight?

00:47.478 --> 00:51.066
ARCHIE: I just wanted to
talk it through with you.
KATRINA: Pity you didn't.

00:51.150 --> 00:53.902
Katrina,
there's an opportunity here
for the whole of Glenbogle.

00:53.987 --> 00:55.405
KATRINA: It's an eyesore.

00:55.488 --> 00:58.241
Glenbogle spring water.
The taste of the Highlands.

00:58.325 --> 01:00.411
I can't believe I didn't think
of this before.

01:00.494 --> 01:02.997
People will pay good money
for pure water.

01:03.080 --> 01:04.498
We start off selling
to restaurants,

01:04.581 --> 01:06.627
then release it in
a few selected chains,

01:06.710 --> 01:09.463
build a reputation,
go national.
We could even take on Europe.

01:09.546 --> 01:11.214
Easy, Adolf.

01:11.298 --> 01:13.343
There's jobs in it, Katrina.
Income for
the whole community.

01:13.425 --> 01:14.969
And for your estate.

01:16.220 --> 01:17.805
So I've got six months

01:17.889 --> 01:20.976
of wolf whistles
and builders' bum
to look forward to.

01:21.060 --> 01:24.189
Katrina, you'll
hardly notice they're here.
These boys are professionals.

01:24.272 --> 01:25.857
They know what they're doing.

01:25.939 --> 01:27.150
(SPUTTERING)

01:27.233 --> 01:28.860
Switch it off!
Pull the lever on the left.

01:28.944 --> 01:31.280
-Go on, pull it.
-I'm pulling it!

01:31.364 --> 01:32.657
You were saying?

01:32.740 --> 01:34.992
-The other left.
-What other left?

02:12.620 --> 02:16.916
Well, of course they
hit granite. Half of Scotland
is made of granite.

02:17.000 --> 02:19.545
I shelled out a fortune
for a geological survey.

02:19.628 --> 02:21.964
Don't tell me
you didn't read it.

02:22.047 --> 02:25.302
Well, just get a new
drill bit. Switzerland?

02:25.385 --> 02:26.970
(SCOFFING)

02:27.053 --> 02:29.764
Right. Right, right.

02:29.848 --> 02:33.144
-Okay, thank you.
-How's the new well going?

02:33.227 --> 02:35.897
It's a rather small
hole in the ground
filled with rain water.

02:35.981 --> 02:38.692
Really? I thought
we had lots of those.

02:38.775 --> 02:40.777
-Who's the letter from?
-Your sister.

02:40.861 --> 02:42.238
Do you know,
I've always wondered

02:42.322 --> 02:44.574
why you didn't see more
of each other down in London.

02:44.657 --> 02:46.618
-Well, it's a big place.
-But Lizzie's in PR.

02:46.701 --> 02:48.495
She could have helped
you launch your restaurant.

02:48.579 --> 02:50.623
Yeah, she helped
launch The Angels' Table.

02:50.706 --> 02:53.583
I've heard of that.
They threw out all the food
critics on the first night.

02:53.667 --> 02:55.211
That was Lizzie's idea.

02:55.295 --> 02:58.131
You see?
That got lots of publicity.

02:58.214 --> 03:01.886
Well, it didn't get very much
when the restaurant folded
a couple of weeks later.

03:01.969 --> 03:05.723
Ah! Maybe that's why
she needs a change of scenery.

03:05.806 --> 03:06.808
What?

03:08.644 --> 03:09.978
Oh, no.

03:12.190 --> 03:15.234
Well, write back, tell her
we've moved to Australia.

03:15.318 --> 03:18.614
Oh. I think you'll
have to tell her yourself.

03:18.697 --> 03:22.368
-Are the midges biting
or are my ears burning?
-Lizzie, darling.

03:22.451 --> 03:25.664
Hello, Mummy. Hello, Archie.

03:25.747 --> 03:28.708
Love the wellies.
Very man-of-the-soil.

03:28.792 --> 03:30.753
Hi, Liz. Nice of you to
tell us you were coming.

03:30.836 --> 03:35.675
I did. Oh, same old postie,
I see. Hopeless.

03:35.758 --> 03:38.929
Archie, be a darling and
take Lizzie's bag upstairs.

03:39.012 --> 03:41.849
Actually, there's a few things
out in the van if
you're not busy.

03:43.518 --> 03:44.685
Right.

03:49.692 --> 03:52.486
MAN: It just feels
so right being here.

03:53.529 --> 03:56.116
Hi. You must be Archie.

03:56.199 --> 04:00.121
I'm Gerald. Gerald Matthews.

04:00.204 --> 04:02.832
And this is Janice

04:02.915 --> 04:06.211
and Neil and Seabreeze.

04:06.294 --> 04:11.884
Lizzie,
I heard all about the house
but it's amazing.

04:11.968 --> 04:13.720
HECTOR: What's this?
More blasted tinkers?

04:13.803 --> 04:15.680
No, Daddy,
they're friends of mine.

04:15.763 --> 04:19.392
Lizzie. Good God.
Aren't you married yet?

04:19.476 --> 04:22.354
Gerald,
this is Hector, my father.

04:22.438 --> 04:25.483
I guessed. How do you do?

04:25.566 --> 04:28.278
Morning.
Where did you spring from?

04:28.360 --> 04:30.531
Your loins. Had you forgotten?

04:30.614 --> 04:33.993
You're home now, girlie,
we don't discuss
loins in public.

04:34.076 --> 04:36.788
Don't just stand there,
lad, give them a hand.

04:38.915 --> 04:41.335
-Here, let me.
-It's heavy.

04:43.046 --> 04:45.131
No, it's no bother.

04:47.175 --> 04:49.678
Really, Archie.
Drilling holes in
the place is one thing,

04:49.762 --> 04:53.808
you might have mentioned
you were
planning a pop festival.

04:53.892 --> 04:55.977
I'll put them in
the guest bedrooms, shall I?

04:56.061 --> 04:57.937
Yes, please, Duncan. Thanks.

05:00.816 --> 05:03.694
Lexie! Any chance of a fry-up?

05:03.778 --> 05:06.907
Only we don't eat red meat.

05:06.990 --> 05:09.451
Right. Fried
porridge all round, then?

05:09.534 --> 05:12.830
-Can you do us kedgeree?
-Oh,
we've not got any haddock.

05:12.914 --> 05:15.375
-Have to be smoked salmon?
-Oh, brilliant.

05:16.709 --> 05:19.004
-What?
-Come away in.

05:24.135 --> 05:28.431
Lizzie, you do know we're
trying to get paying
visitors in here?

05:28.515 --> 05:30.184
I'm not surprised
business is thin

05:30.267 --> 05:32.353
with you scowling
at the guests
as if they had fleas.

05:32.436 --> 05:35.356
Our rates are Â£40 a night.
We don't accept credit cards,

05:35.439 --> 05:37.526
tarot cards or joss sticks.

05:37.609 --> 05:39.486
Believe me,
they'll pay their way.

05:39.569 --> 05:42.365
-How exactly?
-All in good time.

05:42.448 --> 05:44.617
Now if you don't mind,
I'm famished.

05:49.289 --> 05:53.377
-If you need anything,
Lexie'll sort you out.
-Not you?

05:53.460 --> 05:56.756
No. I work with the gillie.

05:56.840 --> 05:59.342
I don't spend that much
time in the Big House.

06:01.554 --> 06:02.805
That's a shame.

06:02.888 --> 06:06.435
(STUTTERING) No, not at all.
I'd rather be...

06:06.518 --> 06:10.939
out and about...
looking after the wildlife,
you know?

06:13.234 --> 06:15.570
It must demand
tremendous skill.

06:15.653 --> 06:17.488
Och, no, not really.

06:17.572 --> 06:20.784
It's just
a matter of being aware
of your surroundings.

06:20.868 --> 06:23.370
Knowing where
to put your feet.

06:26.916 --> 06:30.046
-You'll have to
show me sometime.
-Aye, sure.

06:31.756 --> 06:33.049
Anyway...

06:34.175 --> 06:35.426
Catch you later.

06:38.889 --> 06:41.433
So, how's the HP business?

06:41.516 --> 06:43.853
I wouldn't know,
Daddy, I'm in PR.

06:43.936 --> 06:45.563
How are you two?

06:45.646 --> 06:48.275
Oh, much the same.
A little seize up
at the joints.

06:48.359 --> 06:50.944
You should let Neil
give you a massage.
He's very talented.

06:51.028 --> 06:52.946
Really? How interesting.

06:53.030 --> 06:55.616
-Shiatsu?
-Bless you.

06:55.700 --> 06:57.577
It'll be nice to
see Golly again.

06:57.661 --> 06:59.872
You'll be lucky.
Blasted fellow's gone AWOL.

06:59.955 --> 07:01.957
There's moss growing
in my shotguns.

07:02.041 --> 07:03.709
How are you doing for money?

07:03.793 --> 07:05.378
I beg your pardon?

07:05.461 --> 07:07.589
(SIGHING) We try
not to think about it.

07:07.673 --> 07:09.925
Well, maybe you should

07:10.008 --> 07:12.929
because I've got
an idea that's worth millions.

07:13.012 --> 07:15.765
Well, I'm sure Archie
would love to hear about it.

07:15.848 --> 07:18.394
Archie?
I'm putting it to the laird.

07:20.604 --> 07:23.900
I'll go and have another
look for Golly.

07:23.983 --> 07:26.319
I think he may have been taken
by a pike.

07:26.403 --> 07:30.241
I'm sorry, Lizzie,
I thought we'd told everyone.

07:30.324 --> 07:34.453
Well, it's all
very legal and boring,
but Archie's the laird now.

07:35.872 --> 07:36.873
Well...

07:39.626 --> 07:41.211
congratulations.

07:42.797 --> 07:45.967
I think I'll just go and
see if that Neil's about.

07:50.305 --> 07:53.308
If it's any consolation,
Lizzie,
they didn't tell me either.

07:55.979 --> 07:57.981
So what's this
big idea of yours?

07:59.984 --> 08:01.193
Gerald.

08:02.111 --> 08:04.405
Gerald's the big idea?

08:04.488 --> 08:07.034
He's a healer, Archie.

08:07.117 --> 08:10.787
He has the most amazing power
to tap into your soul.

08:10.871 --> 08:15.001
Once word gets around,
we'll be fighting off
the punters with boiling oil.

08:15.084 --> 08:18.589
So that's why you're here,
you and your hangers-on?

08:18.672 --> 08:21.091
They're
alternative therapists.

08:21.175 --> 08:25.013
They're qualified
in aromatherapy,
reflexology, homoeopathy.

08:25.096 --> 08:26.931
I know,
we could call it the...

08:27.015 --> 08:30.227
Glenbogle Home
For Gullible Hypochondriacs.

08:30.311 --> 08:31.771
It's a good idea.

08:32.395 --> 08:34.440
You know it is.

08:34.523 --> 08:37.193
You just hate it because
it was me who came up with it.

08:37.277 --> 08:40.364
Fine, because
you're going to end up
wishing you had.

08:44.159 --> 08:46.120
Sam, hi, it's Archie.

08:46.204 --> 08:48.540
How is my
favourite old hippie?

08:48.624 --> 08:51.418
No, I don't need any veg.
I need to pick your brains.

08:53.295 --> 08:56.049
Have you ever heard of
a guy called Gerald Matthews?

08:56.132 --> 08:58.550
Some sort of mystical healer.

08:58.635 --> 09:01.972
-I'm sorry,
dear, are you busy?
-Just take a seat inside.

09:02.056 --> 09:04.600
-It's nearly ready.
-I beg your pardon?

09:04.684 --> 09:06.186
Are you not with Lizzie?

09:06.269 --> 09:10.232
Actually, I was looking
for Golly. Is he all right?

09:10.315 --> 09:14.278
-I was expecting him
the other day, but...
-He's fine as far as I know.

09:15.571 --> 09:17.031
-Do you want
to leave a message or...

09:17.115 --> 09:20.035
-Oh, just tell him
it was Alice.

09:20.119 --> 09:23.122
He's supposed to be
fixing up my house.

09:23.205 --> 09:24.833
What, DIY sort of thing?

09:24.916 --> 09:27.877
Aye, that sort of thing.

09:27.961 --> 09:31.924
-A man of many talents.
-Oh, yes, he is.

09:33.634 --> 09:36.054
Anyway.

09:36.138 --> 09:39.516
-I'll tell him you called.
-Thank you, my dear.

09:46.107 --> 09:48.652
GERALD: This is
an extraordinary place.

09:50.821 --> 09:54.242
The elements, total harmony.

09:56.202 --> 09:57.996
The yin and the yang.

10:00.374 --> 10:05.212
Oh, yes, I've heard of them.
Those two pandas they
couldn't get to breed.

10:05.296 --> 10:08.592
I think you're winding
me up, aren't you, Hector?

10:08.675 --> 10:11.261
I don't get much of
a chance to do that here.

10:11.344 --> 10:13.931
Mind you, with Archie,
it's rather like
shooting goldfish.

10:14.015 --> 10:17.603
Archie will show you round
the estate. I hope you'll make
yourselves at home.

10:17.686 --> 10:19.855
You are very generous, Hector.
Thank you.

10:19.938 --> 10:21.982
Not at all. Change of
scenery does us all good.

10:22.066 --> 10:24.235
Now, look after Gerald,
Archie, will you?

10:24.319 --> 10:27.489
He's a bit concerned
about the pandas apparently.

10:31.827 --> 10:34.080
BOY: Bye. See you later.
BOY 2: Bye.

10:37.042 --> 10:40.587
Bye. And don't forget
it's Nature Trail tomorrow.

10:40.670 --> 10:44.509
Nature Trail?
Spreading sedition
in young minds, you mean.

10:44.592 --> 10:47.596
I only do that in
the classroom. Hello.

10:47.679 --> 10:49.056
Hi, Katrina.

10:50.974 --> 10:54.562
You look fantastic.
How long are you home for?

10:54.646 --> 10:58.316
I'm not sure yet. Ever maybe.

10:58.400 --> 11:02.029
Seriously? You must have
given Archie a surprise.

11:02.113 --> 11:04.281
He's got a few
more surprises coming.

11:04.365 --> 11:09.162
Come on, I've got a bottle
of bubbly in the fridge just
waiting for a good excuse.

11:10.747 --> 11:14.001
That is one sexy set of
wheels. Can I have a spin?

11:14.085 --> 11:15.336
Sure.

11:20.008 --> 11:23.262
-Goes a bit, doesn't it?
-Hey, that's my bike.

11:23.345 --> 11:25.890
After all these years,
you still fell for it.

11:25.974 --> 11:27.225
(KATRINA LAUGHING)

11:27.308 --> 11:29.437
We're not based anywhere.

11:29.520 --> 11:32.398
-We follow our stars.
-Oh, yeah?

11:32.481 --> 11:35.485
-And how did you
meet Lizzie, then?
-She found me.

11:35.569 --> 11:39.364
-She told you about Glenbogle?
-No, it's what
the crystal told us.

11:39.448 --> 11:42.618
I dowsed a map of the area.
It virtually took off.

11:42.702 --> 11:46.080
You know, this place
sits on the conjunction
of seven ley lines.

11:46.164 --> 11:48.042
I must have missed
that one somehow.

11:48.125 --> 11:53.172
Every lunar cycle, this place
will become a focus
for terrestrial energy.

11:53.255 --> 11:57.177
And at the end of this week,
full moon's in
the house of the sun.

11:57.260 --> 12:00.139
-So you're a bit early, then?
-Well, we have to prepare.

12:00.222 --> 12:05.352
It'll be
an extraordinary nexus
of spiritual and erotic power.

12:05.437 --> 12:06.897
Right.

12:06.980 --> 12:09.274
And this alternative
health centre, is that

12:09.357 --> 12:11.276
Lizzie's idea or yours?

12:11.359 --> 12:13.905
Cynicism corrodes the soul,
Archie.

12:14.947 --> 12:18.160
Listen, Gerald,

12:18.243 --> 12:20.454
I don't mean to be offensive

12:20.537 --> 12:22.915
but Lizzie often
has these flashes of genius

12:22.998 --> 12:24.793
and somehow they always
seem to burn out.

12:24.876 --> 12:28.380
And you're worried that
you'll be left
holding the ashes?

12:28.463 --> 12:32.843
Finding ley lines is great.
Next week's lottery numbers,
now that would be something.

12:32.927 --> 12:34.845
Your father says
you're drilling for water.

12:34.929 --> 12:38.100
We were but they bent
the drill bit on some turf.

12:39.643 --> 12:41.771
Drills violate the earth.

12:43.439 --> 12:47.444
Mother Nature prefers
it if you ask nicely.

12:55.286 --> 12:58.331
I'll run and fetch a spade,
shall I?

13:00.668 --> 13:02.670
Maybe if we sacrificed
a virgin?

13:02.753 --> 13:04.338
A little patience,
Archie, please.

13:33.956 --> 13:36.793
It's a knack some people have.

13:42.717 --> 13:46.679
-KATRINA: Lizzie, we're
not in the Arctic Circle.
-I love doing this.

13:46.763 --> 13:50.684
-Incinerating things?
-You make me sound
like a pyromaniac.

13:50.768 --> 13:53.438
You were always
making bonfires.
Usually out of your diaries.

13:53.521 --> 13:56.232
I was always trying
to make a fresh start.

13:56.316 --> 14:00.196
-So what's he like? Gerald?
-He's extraordinary.

14:00.279 --> 14:02.740
It's like he can
see right through you.

14:02.823 --> 14:05.494
He has this animal aura.

14:05.577 --> 14:08.914
-Sounds like he's
more than just a client.
-Do you mind?

14:08.997 --> 14:11.208
It's unethical to
sleep with the customers.

14:11.292 --> 14:14.754
Unethical?
I thought you were in PR.

14:14.837 --> 14:17.633
So is there
a man in your life?

14:17.716 --> 14:20.928
I think I'm better
off without a man.

14:21.011 --> 14:24.390
It's just as well, they're not
exactly thick on
the ground round here.

14:24.474 --> 14:26.851
Unless you count Archie.
He's thick enough.

14:29.438 --> 14:32.441
-I don't believe it.
-What?

14:32.525 --> 14:34.819
I mention Archie
and you go all pink.

14:34.902 --> 14:38.615
Well, I'm not surprised
with that fire
you've got going there.

14:38.698 --> 14:41.034
I'm not the only one
with a fire going, am I?

14:42.370 --> 14:43.871
You are deranged.

14:43.955 --> 14:46.416
You went that
colour when Andy Collins
asked you to marry him.

14:46.499 --> 14:48.502
When I was 12.

14:48.585 --> 14:52.381
Katrina, it's me, Lizzie.

14:52.464 --> 14:56.344
You're not fooling
anyone except yourself.

14:56.428 --> 14:59.890
-That's it.
-No more champagne for you.

15:09.276 --> 15:12.572
This is lovely.
Do you have any lavender?

15:12.655 --> 15:15.908
Not much call for it.
Doesn't exactly
go with grouse.

15:15.992 --> 15:18.620
It makes the most
wonderful massage oil.

15:18.704 --> 15:23.877
I see. Round here we
make do with peanut butter.

15:23.960 --> 15:26.880
I'll have a look in
the gardens. Thanks.

15:26.963 --> 15:29.800
You're welcome. Bubbleheid.

15:32.553 --> 15:34.180
Can I help you?

15:34.263 --> 15:38.393
Oh, hello. I was wondering,
is Golly around?

15:38.477 --> 15:41.773
He doesn't spend much time
around the Big House.

15:41.856 --> 15:45.193
So he's all right, then?
Only I was
a wee bit concerned.

15:45.276 --> 15:48.447
-Why,
is he doing your DIY as well?
-Pardon?

15:48.530 --> 15:51.575
Only... Well, there was a lady
looking for him yesterday.

15:51.658 --> 15:53.536
Oh, right.

15:53.620 --> 15:57.582
Well,
he's very capable, you know.
Good with his hands.

16:00.252 --> 16:01.962
Would you like
to wait for him inside?

16:02.046 --> 16:03.964
Och, no,
I don't want to put you out.

16:04.048 --> 16:07.094
Oh, you're not.
Kettle's just boiled. Come on.

16:22.361 --> 16:23.571
(BUCKET CLATTERING)

16:26.282 --> 16:29.328
I hear Moses
produced a miracle.

16:29.411 --> 16:31.997
Well, if this is fit to drink,
it could be a miracle.

16:32.081 --> 16:33.666
Golly could have
found that spring.

16:33.749 --> 16:35.502
He knows every watercourse
for miles.

16:35.585 --> 16:37.587
Yeah, but Golly wasn't here.

16:37.671 --> 16:41.049
That's what I wanted
to talk to you about.
Nobody's seen him in days.

16:41.133 --> 16:43.511
The ladies of the locality
are worried about him.

16:43.594 --> 16:45.179
The ladies?

16:45.263 --> 16:50.060
Apparently, they rely on Golly
to address
their womanly needs.

16:51.019 --> 16:52.479
Golly?

16:52.563 --> 16:56.151
Well, don't look so shocked.
He's a gillie, not a monk.

16:56.234 --> 16:57.694
Well, yeah, but...

16:57.777 --> 17:03.576
The thing is, lately,
he hasn't been
rising to the occasion.

17:03.659 --> 17:05.537
Well,
what am I supposed to do?

17:05.619 --> 17:08.415
Well, he's upset
and he's depressed.

17:08.498 --> 17:11.919
-He needs to talk to someone.
-Well, why me?
I know nothing about it.

17:12.002 --> 17:13.421
Oh, really?

17:14.213 --> 17:15.839
Wouldn't you?

17:15.923 --> 17:18.218
I'm not sure I really want to
discuss this with you, Lexie.

17:18.301 --> 17:20.471
Well, I don't want to
discuss it with you, either.

17:20.554 --> 17:22.556
But Golly needs to
discuss it with someone.

17:23.348 --> 17:25.226
And you're the laird.

17:55.928 --> 17:59.683
Oh, Golly, thank goodness.
For a minute there,
I thought I was lost.

17:59.767 --> 18:02.353
You were lost.

18:02.436 --> 18:04.270
People have been
asking after you.

18:04.355 --> 18:08.819
I saw the weirdoes arriving.
Thought I'd better
make myself scarce.

18:08.902 --> 18:11.280
-Lizzie's friends?
-I know the type.

18:11.364 --> 18:14.784
Nature lovers.
Should spend a few
nights in the open.

18:16.035 --> 18:18.163
See how much
nature loves them.

18:19.081 --> 18:20.958
So what have you been up to?

18:21.041 --> 18:23.336
I've been looking
for the stag, Big Eric.

18:24.212 --> 18:26.256
There's something wrong.

18:26.339 --> 18:28.424
Should be with the hinds.

18:28.508 --> 18:31.220
They need their sire and
he's nowhere to be seen.

18:32.680 --> 18:35.183
Maybe he's a little stressed.

18:36.268 --> 18:37.686
Stressed?

18:37.769 --> 18:39.479
Well, it's a vicious circle,
isn't it?

18:39.563 --> 18:42.358
The more he worries about it,
the worse it gets.

18:42.442 --> 18:45.236
Maybe he should
learn to relax.

18:45.319 --> 18:49.116
-Go with
the flow sort of thing.
-Go with the flow?

18:49.199 --> 18:51.785
Are we talking about
a deer here or a fish?

18:53.538 --> 18:56.082
Well, um, neither actually.

18:57.667 --> 18:59.587
What the hell are
we talking about?

19:01.297 --> 19:03.841
Your... Your problem.

19:06.094 --> 19:07.846
What problem would that be?

19:09.222 --> 19:13.186
Well, your... The lack of...

19:14.353 --> 19:16.564
You know.

19:16.647 --> 19:21.236
You're lucky this gun is
not loaded, your lairdship.

19:21.320 --> 19:24.657
Otherwise you'd be picking
buckshot out of your tiny,
skinny aristocratic...

19:24.741 --> 19:26.951
For goodness sake, Golly,
it's not the end of the world.

19:27.035 --> 19:30.164
-It happens to all of us.
-Not to me, it doesn't!

19:34.210 --> 19:37.005
Golly, wait.

19:37.088 --> 19:39.883
You could at least point me
in the direction of home.

19:39.966 --> 19:43.095
You're the wildlife expert.
You work it out.

19:58.530 --> 20:01.742
Hey, have you seen this?

20:01.826 --> 20:03.619
New handbag?

20:03.702 --> 20:05.580
Well, I'm glad you
think it's funny.

20:05.664 --> 20:08.542
That well hasn't
dried up in 30 years.

20:08.625 --> 20:11.170
Oh, Katrina, it's
the first I've heard of it.

20:11.254 --> 20:12.839
That's just typical.

20:12.922 --> 20:15.466
You totally
disrupt somebody's life
and then you think

20:15.550 --> 20:18.846
if you flutter
your big brown eyes,
they'll just roll over.

20:18.929 --> 20:20.347
Is this about your well?

20:20.430 --> 20:23.101
-Yes, this is about my well.
-Okay, then, I'm sorry.

20:23.184 --> 20:24.727
But if you go
into your kitchen,

20:24.811 --> 20:26.729
you'll find these things
called taps.

20:26.813 --> 20:31.026
-That chlorinated widdle.
-It's good enough
for the rest of us.

20:31.110 --> 20:35.073
Anyway, why do you need
a spring if you're opening
an alternative health centre?

20:35.157 --> 20:37.492
Who says I am? Lizzie?

20:37.576 --> 20:39.536
Well, come on,
it's got to be better

20:39.619 --> 20:42.582
than sticking
a great big bottling plant
in the middle of the glen.

20:42.665 --> 20:45.793
Unless, of course,
the laird doesn't want
to share his mansion

20:45.877 --> 20:47.087
with the common ruck.

20:47.880 --> 20:49.631
Mmm.

21:20.125 --> 21:22.336

21:22.419 --> 21:26.424
Oh, yes, it really is so...

21:27.717 --> 21:31.096
Oh, just a little higher, oh.

21:33.432 --> 21:36.353
Oh, oh, oh, I've never
dreamed it could be...

21:38.146 --> 21:39.648
All right, what's going on?

21:39.731 --> 21:41.734
Oh, it's called reflexology.

21:41.818 --> 21:44.237
It's absolutely astounding.

21:44.320 --> 21:46.697
Oh, no, no, don't stop.

21:46.781 --> 21:49.159
I see. Jolly good.

21:49.243 --> 21:52.621
-You should try it, darling.
-I don't think so.

21:52.704 --> 21:55.708
Oh, don't be so stodgy.
Get them off.

21:55.792 --> 21:58.169
-What?
-Your shoes.

21:58.628 --> 21:59.630
Oh.

22:02.883 --> 22:04.970
It really is quite
extraordinary.

22:05.053 --> 22:06.972
I thought those chaps
just cut your toe nails.

22:07.055 --> 22:09.266
That's chiropody,
not reflexology.

22:09.349 --> 22:13.479
Ah. You know, Lizzie,
I really think
you're on to something.

22:13.563 --> 22:16.023
Unfortunately,
Archie's not convinced.

22:16.107 --> 22:20.028
Oh, Archie.
Not even after
Gerald found that spring?

22:20.112 --> 22:21.947
It was a trick.

22:22.030 --> 22:23.825
Like he said,
lots of people have the knack.
Anyone could have found it.

22:23.908 --> 22:26.828
You didn't. How much
did that survey cost?

22:26.911 --> 22:28.914
It's an investment.
We'll recoup it.

22:28.998 --> 22:32.835
The alternative health centre
wouldn't need any investment,
we've got it all here.

22:32.918 --> 22:36.673
-Lizzie, I'm
thinking in the long-term.
-So am I.

22:37.632 --> 22:40.051
I'd like to have my baby here.

22:41.429 --> 22:43.139
What did she say?

22:44.932 --> 22:46.977
I'm pregnant, Daddy.

22:47.060 --> 22:50.522
Oh, Lizzie. Oh.

22:50.606 --> 22:53.109
Excellent, absolutely
splendid. Hear that, Archie?

22:53.193 --> 22:54.944
A grandson to carry
on the family line.

22:55.028 --> 22:58.531
-Marvellous.
Congratulations, Liz.
-It might be a granddaughter.

than nothing, isn't it?

-He is the father?
-Yes, he does. He is.

Lizzie, I know I'm hopelessly
old-fashioned, but we haven't
missed anything, have we?

23:29.026 --> 23:31.612
-Like an engagement?
-Mummy.

23:33.781 --> 23:35.200

matters in hand, I think.

would be more humane.

please don't make a scene.

I don't intend to.

to be a gentleman.

24:24.966 --> 24:27.093
Lizzie's just told
us her good news.

24:27.177 --> 24:29.013
Oh, you must be
very proud of her.

24:29.096 --> 24:31.724
I understand you
deserve some of the credit.

24:31.807 --> 24:35.312
In which case
there's probably something
you want to ask me.

24:35.395 --> 24:39.024
Lizzie said it would be
okay to use the library.

24:40.233 --> 24:43.404
-Library?
-For our healing
session tonight.

24:43.487 --> 24:45.615
You're welcome to join us.

24:45.698 --> 24:48.869

keeps the spirit in balance.

Every day, once upon a time.

-Why did you stop?
-Got old.

25:04.846 --> 25:08.975
Do you ever think that perhaps
you got old
because you stopped?

25:11.896 --> 25:16.067

starting at 7:00, okay?
-Righto.

-Oh, sorry.
-Oh, no, no. Please, come in.

that shape our lives.

Ah, right. Colonic
irrigation for the soul.

We can't bury
the pain in our hearts.

26:26.149 --> 26:27.692
No, absolutely.

26:29.987 --> 26:33.365
Is there anything that
you would like to share?

26:34.951 --> 26:39.164
Uh... No. Nothing I
can think of, sorry.

you can't think of?

26:52.805 --> 26:55.099
The boating
accident on the loch.

26:56.768 --> 27:00.314
When Jamie drowned.

27:03.984 --> 27:06.571
I know you must
feel terrible guilt.

27:09.908 --> 27:12.161
You know nothing of the sort.

27:14.330 --> 27:15.873
Excuse me.

27:18.252 --> 27:21.630
Archie, there is no
healing in denial.

27:21.713 --> 27:23.299
(DOOR CLOSING)

27:25.552 --> 27:28.973
Lizzie, have you got a minute?
I don't care who you
and Gerald try to fool,

27:29.056 --> 27:30.766
but just leave
the family out of it. Okay?

27:30.849 --> 27:32.351
What's the matter?

27:32.434 --> 27:34.436
He's been interrogating me
about Jamie for one thing.

27:34.520 --> 27:37.107
It happened to me,
too, Archie.

27:37.190 --> 27:40.527
-But, no, it just has to
be about you, doesn't it?
-What?

27:40.610 --> 27:43.781
After Jamie died,
it was like I didn't exist.

27:43.864 --> 27:46.158
Everyone was so worried
about poor wee Archie.

27:46.242 --> 27:48.996
-You got all
Hector's affection.
-What affection?

27:49.079 --> 27:50.956
Then when things go wrong,
who do they ask for?

27:51.039 --> 27:54.627
Wee Archie,
who never gave them
a thought since he left.

27:54.711 --> 27:56.838
I'm older than you,
no one ever asked me.

27:56.921 --> 27:59.884
Because the best you can come
up with is some failed
double-glazing salesman

27:59.967 --> 28:01.635
who's masquerading as a guru.

28:01.719 --> 28:04.471
-You've been
checking up on Gerald?
-Of course I have.

28:04.555 --> 28:06.641
He's an undischarged bankrupt.

28:06.725 --> 28:09.269
For goodness sake, Archie,
I could have told you
that if you'd asked me.

28:09.352 --> 28:10.771
You mean you knew?

28:10.855 --> 28:13.649
Gerald's abilities are real.
You've seen them.

28:19.573 --> 28:21.617
Is that what it looks like?

28:22.785 --> 28:24.787
What does it look like?

28:24.871 --> 28:27.457
Like you're hard on poachers.

28:27.540 --> 28:29.627
I'm building a new hide.

28:29.710 --> 28:32.713
-I'm Gerald.
-I know who you are.

28:32.796 --> 28:36.009
-Do you want a hand?
-I'm not entirely useless.

28:36.468 --> 28:37.469
Yet.

28:40.598 --> 28:42.225
Lonely up here.

28:42.308 --> 28:45.436
Solitary. Not the same thing.

28:46.730 --> 28:48.398
All the same...

28:50.901 --> 28:53.196
there's no one
to see your pain.

28:54.239 --> 28:56.741
Who says I'm in pain?

28:56.824 --> 28:59.328
You know,
the South American Indians
believe

28:59.411 --> 29:01.622
that we each of us have
a spirit animal.

29:01.705 --> 29:04.626
-Uh-huh.
-Mine's the salmon.

29:06.211 --> 29:09.005
Well, I'm Church
of Scotland myself.

29:09.881 --> 29:11.884
Yours will be the stag.

29:13.886 --> 29:16.557
There are no stags round here.

29:16.640 --> 29:20.686
Well, when there are,
you'll start to feel better.

29:24.399 --> 29:26.317
Easy on the poachers, eh?

29:52.640 --> 29:54.767
There's
an osprey nesting nearby.

29:54.851 --> 29:57.604
She hunts on that
stretch of water just there.

29:57.687 --> 30:00.232
Amazing.

30:00.316 --> 30:03.819
When she dives for a fish,
it'll take your breath away.

30:03.903 --> 30:08.325
Duncan...
you know I said I was
into the birds and the bees?

30:08.408 --> 30:12.079
Oh, yeah, the hives,
they're just a wee
bit further up the glen.

30:12.163 --> 30:15.249
-This isn't
quite what I meant.
-What?

30:17.461 --> 30:19.713
What's the matter?

30:19.796 --> 30:25.011
Nothing. I just feel
a wee bit exposed, you know.

30:25.094 --> 30:28.222
You think there's a wildcat
out there stalking us?

30:30.267 --> 30:31.769

the life out of me there.

-Lexie, what are you after?
-Mushrooms.

30:45.493 --> 30:47.955
-No need to ask
what you're after.
-We haven't got very far,

30:48.038 --> 30:50.999
-if that's
what's bothering you.
-Why should I be bothered?

30:51.083 --> 30:55.255
35,000 acres
and you're picking
mushrooms round here?

30:55.338 --> 30:59.510
Look, if you two have got
something going, I'd really
like to know about it.

30:59.593 --> 31:02.805
You've been on

every day when I was younger.

You're not younger any more.
-Nonsense. All in the mind.

32:03.083 --> 32:05.837

bit in your lungs as well.
-I got cramp, that's all.

never mind swim.

-Oh no, no, no.

-Help me get him upstairs.
-I don't want any help.

of this. It's time you and
your friends left.

-No, Archie.
-Lizzie,
what else does he have to do?

32:32.576 --> 32:34.955
You can't blame Gerald
for Hector's behaviour.

32:35.038 --> 32:39.167
Father is sensitive
about his age and his health,
Gerald knew that.

isn't it?
Finding people's weak points.

as much as yours.
-Lizzie!

he might have a point?

How they act on it
isn't his problem.

-What about the baby?

suggests hydrotherapy,

he put you through this.

-Well, have you?

43:09.402 --> 43:12.323
KATRINA: Oh, take my hand.
Stay close.

43:33.932 --> 43:34.933
Duncan.

43:37.727 --> 43:39.270
You creep.

43:57.083 --> 43:58.460
What are you looking for?

43:58.544 --> 44:01.171
I'll give you a clue.
It's no mushrooms.

44:09.222 --> 44:11.267
Perhaps it's
better if he does go.

44:11.350 --> 44:13.602
If he can't stand the heat,
he should get out of Scotland.

44:13.686 --> 44:15.814
-Quite right, dear.
-Oh, don't talk nonsense.

44:15.897 --> 44:18.358
Can't we lock him in his room
or something
till he calms down?

44:18.442 --> 44:20.610
We'll just have to
let them slug it out.

44:20.694 --> 44:21.863
(POTS CLATTERING)

44:21.946 --> 44:23.531
Sounds like
they're at it already.

44:23.614 --> 44:25.742
God almighty, it's like
trying to sleep in a brothel.

44:25.825 --> 44:27.870
-Mmm, 'tis, isn't it?
-LEXIE: Duncan!

44:27.953 --> 44:31.040
-What?
-I've brought you
a nice milky drink.

44:31.123 --> 44:36.129
I don't want
a nice milky drink
unless it's got whisky in it.

44:36.212 --> 44:40.801
Oh, there must be
something we can do
to help you sleep.

44:45.639 --> 44:47.017
(THUDDING)

44:49.519 --> 44:50.979
Hello?

44:55.026 --> 44:56.569
(DOOR CREAKING)

45:07.374 --> 45:09.209
(GOLLY WHISTLING)

45:17.219 --> 45:20.180
Archie.
Fine day for a journey.

45:20.263 --> 45:21.640
You look a bit happier.

45:21.723 --> 45:25.520
Oh, I am, I am.
I'm less stressed.

45:25.603 --> 45:29.191
-Ah,
so Big Eric's back in town?
-Mmm.

45:29.274 --> 45:33.278
And that Gerald, though,
he has his head screwed on.

45:34.823 --> 45:36.574
For a weirdo.

45:36.658 --> 45:38.451
-Mmm.
-Mmm.

45:44.333 --> 45:46.670
Great. Rub it in.

45:55.304 --> 46:00.394
Away and shoot
a small-brained animal,
preferably yourself.

46:00.477 --> 46:02.646
You can't pretend
last night didn't happen.

46:02.730 --> 46:06.359
Last night you pushed me
on the kitchen table and stuck
your tongue in my ear.

46:06.443 --> 46:09.739
-It doesn't mean
we're betrothed.
-There's more to it than that,

46:09.822 --> 46:11.532
and I think you know it.

46:11.615 --> 46:14.535
Here, go and make
up with wee Janice.

46:32.014 --> 46:34.142
Oh, Duncan,
will you bring the car round?

46:34.225 --> 46:36.686
-Yeah, sure, boss.
-Thanks.

46:36.770 --> 46:39.439
Morning all, and what
a splendid morning it is.

46:39.522 --> 46:42.234
-Father,
I know you're upset but...
-About what?

46:42.318 --> 46:45.697
Oh, yes, your abdication.
I think I'll get over it.

46:45.781 --> 46:48.492
Lexie! A large plate
of your finest cinders.

46:50.494 --> 46:52.622
Archie, were those
your bags out in the hall?

46:52.705 --> 46:55.833
-Yeah.
Sorry, are they in the way?
-Not any more.

46:55.917 --> 46:58.796
-I told Duncan to
take them back upstairs.
-Lizzie.

46:58.879 --> 47:01.006
Just listen to me for once.

47:02.883 --> 47:04.469
I made a mistake.

47:05.678 --> 47:08.973
-I'm not having a baby.
-Not yet.

47:10.351 --> 47:11.644
Oh, Lizzie.

47:13.604 --> 47:15.106
I thought I was.

47:16.066 --> 47:18.318
Well, part of me did.

47:18.402 --> 47:21.864
And part of me just wanted
to get one over on Archie.

47:21.948 --> 47:24.200
And that's no way
to start a new life.

47:25.451 --> 47:26.911
I'm sorry.

47:29.665 --> 47:31.625
Oh, well.

47:31.708 --> 47:34.045
Ball back in
your court, old man.

47:41.011 --> 47:42.805
(DOOR OPENING)

47:46.309 --> 47:48.562
Liz, come on.

47:48.645 --> 47:50.230
(SOBBING)

47:54.527 --> 47:56.863
You can try again.

47:56.946 --> 47:59.575
Don't leave, Archie.

47:59.658 --> 48:04.956
You're the one to save
this place. I can never stick
at anything long enough.

48:05.039 --> 48:08.334
I'm sorry I wouldn't listen,
it was just pig-headed vanity.

48:09.335 --> 48:11.338
Your centre's a great idea.

48:11.422 --> 48:15.761
But it needs thinking through.
Not my speciality.

48:15.844 --> 48:18.221
You have to stay.
Mummy and Daddy need you.

48:19.473 --> 48:21.141
And one deluded local.

48:22.560 --> 48:23.561
Who?

48:25.521 --> 48:28.567
That's my wee brother,
can't see what's
under his nose.

48:31.528 --> 48:34.616
Dear child,
take care of yourself.

48:34.699 --> 48:36.326
It's been so lovely
having you to stay.

48:36.409 --> 48:38.328
Lizzie,
you don't have to rush off.

48:38.411 --> 48:41.332
I'd better get back
before they sell the flat.

48:41.415 --> 48:43.584
Well, we're here
whenever you need us.

48:43.667 --> 48:46.254
-I'm here.
-I know.

48:48.298 --> 48:52.678
I was too hard on Gerald.
He's... He's different.

48:53.554 --> 48:55.807
He is, isn't he?

48:55.890 --> 48:59.061
And if you ever need
these windows replacing,
he's your man.

48:59.144 --> 49:01.271
-Anyway.
-Good luck.

49:04.526 --> 49:07.946
-Bye, Mum.
-Oh, Lizzie darling.

49:11.575 --> 49:13.619
Ah, bye, Lizzie.

49:17.541 --> 49:19.376
-Have a good trip.
-Bye.

49:23.464 --> 49:24.882
(CAR STARTING)

49:36.271 --> 49:39.692
I know, I could run
a hosepipe to the well
and fill it with tap water.

49:39.775 --> 49:42.903
What do you want me to do?
Bung a big cork in the spring?

49:43.737 --> 49:44.989
Golly?

49:47.951 --> 49:49.828
Is it okay?

49:49.911 --> 49:53.624
Scree-fall up
the glen diverted the burn.

49:53.708 --> 49:56.419
I cleared it the other day.
The water table's back up.

49:56.502 --> 49:59.006
So it had nothing to
do with the spring?

49:59.089 --> 50:01.800
Water rarely
runs uphill, Archie.

50:03.010 --> 50:04.554
Thanks for the drink.

50:06.473 --> 50:10.478
If you're still
looking for a bottling plant,
I know one going cheap.

50:11.103 --> 50:12.438
Where?

50:12.521 --> 50:15.316
Put it this way,
what's in it for me?

50:17.152 --> 50:19.529
-Katrina, where? Tell me.
-Might do.

50:19.613 --> 50:21.908
-No, seriously.
-Ask nicely.

50:21.991 --> 50:25.328
-Katrina, please,
will you just tell me?
-Oh, getting desperate now.
