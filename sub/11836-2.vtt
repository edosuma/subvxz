00:01.100 --> 00:02.566
DOLE:
Previously on The Practice...

00:02.600 --> 00:04.633
WALSH: We've heard testimony
of another client

00:04.666 --> 00:06.000
who terrorized your wife.

00:06.033 --> 00:07.133
He was murdered.

00:07.166 --> 00:08.200
I smell a pattern.

00:08.233 --> 00:10.166
Threaten Lindsay Dole,

00:10.200 --> 00:11.266
you get killed.

00:11.300 --> 00:12.700
Objection!

00:12.733 --> 00:14.333
He knew his wife was culpable.

00:14.366 --> 00:16.533
Why the immediate
assembly of lawyers,

00:16.566 --> 00:18.566
the refusal to speak
to police?

00:18.600 --> 00:20.666
This is consistent

00:20.700 --> 00:23.666
with the behavior
of guilty people.

00:23.700 --> 00:25.133
WEST: Ms. Dole,
I am bound

00:25.166 --> 00:26.666
by the statute
to sentence you

00:26.700 --> 00:28.500
to the Framingham
Correction Facility

00:28.533 --> 00:30.566
for the remainder
of your natural life.

00:30.600 --> 00:32.232
WASHINGTON:
The emotional undercurrents

00:32.266 --> 00:33.933
of a case play a part.

00:33.966 --> 00:35.966
Give me this appeal.

00:36.933 --> 00:37.800
James Berluti,

00:37.833 --> 00:38.666
Melissa Halpern.

00:38.700 --> 00:39.600
Hello.

00:39.633 --> 00:40.866
This is my daughter, Joey.

00:40.900 --> 00:42.166
Sixteen years ago,

00:42.200 --> 00:43.600
I kidnapped her.

00:43.633 --> 00:45.533
Does your daughter know?
HALPERN: No.

00:45.566 --> 00:47.800
I recently read
a magazine article

00:47.833 --> 00:48.966
about the birth mother

00:49.000 --> 00:50.200
and the woman they accused

00:50.233 --> 00:51.266
of stealing Joey.

00:51.300 --> 00:52.866
BERLUTI: I represent
the individual

00:52.900 --> 00:55.366
who kidnapped your daughter
16 years ago.

00:55.400 --> 00:58.366
The individual sends
to you this money order

00:58.400 --> 01:00.506
in the amount of $70,000.

01:00.540 --> 01:02.240
GAMBLE:
Jimmy, police got a visit

01:02.273 --> 01:04.673
from a woman named
Sally Burns last night.

01:04.706 --> 01:06.706
You had to know
she'd go to the police.

01:06.740 --> 01:07.740
So what?

01:07.773 --> 01:09.406
it's attorney/client.

01:09.439 --> 01:11.140
We already know who she is,

01:11.173 --> 01:12.540
Bernice White.

01:12.573 --> 01:13.540
First, you're calling me

01:13.573 --> 01:15.440
saying it's really important
that we meet,

01:15.473 --> 01:17.073
and then I see you
on television

01:17.106 --> 01:19.340
concerning a crime
that I have been suspected of

01:19.373 --> 01:20.673
for 16 years.

01:20.706 --> 01:22.940
Bernice White, please place
your hands behind your back.

01:22.973 --> 01:24.406
What? Tell them
I'm not your client!

01:24.440 --> 01:25.506
YOUNG: We neither confirm

01:25.540 --> 01:27.540
nor deny that she is our client.
What?!

01:27.573 --> 01:28.540
We neither confirm

01:28.573 --> 01:30.273
nor deny she is our client.

01:44.206 --> 01:45.506
(sighs)

01:46.906 --> 01:48.006
(door opens)

01:51.373 --> 01:53.106
She's fading.

01:53.140 --> 01:55.006
I just can't close it.

01:55.040 --> 01:56.006
Okay.

02:04.446 --> 02:05.680
Bernice?

02:05.713 --> 02:07.013
I'm Helen Gamble.

02:07.046 --> 02:09.213
Why won't you
leave me alone?

02:09.246 --> 02:10.479
I'm the district attorney.

02:10.513 --> 02:12.246
Can we get you a cup
of coffee or something?

02:12.280 --> 02:14.713
WHITE: No, I just
wanna go to sleep.

02:14.746 --> 02:16.779
I know.

02:17.013 --> 02:18.679
Listen, I'm very familiar

02:18.713 --> 02:20.946
with these kinds of cases,

02:20.980 --> 02:22.380
and the truth is,

02:22.413 --> 02:23.846
I happen to believe you.

02:24.813 --> 02:27.080
You say you didn't
kidnap this baby,

02:27.113 --> 02:28.980
and I believe you believe

02:29.013 --> 02:30.846
with all your heart

02:30.880 --> 02:32.346
that that's the truth.

02:33.313 --> 02:35.980
But I also believe
you're suffering

02:36.013 --> 02:37.346
from a form of amnesia,

02:37.380 --> 02:38.780
which is extremely common.

02:38.813 --> 02:39.946
No.

02:41.713 --> 02:43.613
Sometimes...

02:43.646 --> 02:45.380
when good people commit acts

02:45.413 --> 02:47.813
that shock
their own conscience,

02:47.846 --> 02:49.113
they block it out.

02:49.680 --> 02:50.513
In your mind,

02:50.546 --> 02:52.746
this kidnapping never happened,

02:52.780 --> 02:53.380
but...

02:55.113 --> 02:56.613
the thing is,

03:00.320 --> 03:02.786
a witness saw you leave
with the baby,

03:04.420 --> 03:06.953
and now what the police
aren't telling you

03:06.986 --> 03:08.853
they've now located the woman

03:08.886 --> 03:10.520
you gave the baby to.

03:10.953 --> 03:13.720
She identified your picture.

03:13.753 --> 03:16.253
You will be convicted
for this crime.

03:16.286 --> 03:18.020
It's not even
a question anymore.

03:18.053 --> 03:20.186
The only thing
to be determined

03:20.220 --> 03:22.220
is what happens to you.

03:22.353 --> 03:24.553
Do you understand
what I'm saying, Bernice?

03:25.986 --> 03:28.120
Your life is in your hands.

03:28.153 --> 03:29.520
You tell us the truth,

03:29.553 --> 03:32.420
we can help you.

03:32.453 --> 03:34.186
You can get home.

03:34.220 --> 03:37.153
(music playing)

03:38.986 --> 03:41.920
(music playing)

04:31.926 --> 04:33.626
We're moving you
from the orientation unit

04:33.659 --> 04:35.226
to the compound.
Okay.

04:35.259 --> 04:37.226
OFFICER: Don't pick up
disciplinary tickets.

04:37.259 --> 04:38.626
You could stay there
for the duration

04:38.659 --> 04:39.593
of your sentence,

04:39.626 --> 04:41.193
which is...

04:41.226 --> 04:42.593
Life.

04:42.626 --> 04:44.093
I'm hoping to reduce that.

04:44.126 --> 04:46.726
My appeal is scheduled
for tomorrow.

04:46.760 --> 04:48.660
Actually, I was hoping
that I could attend.

04:49.126 --> 04:50.126
Sorry.

04:50.993 --> 04:52.860
You filled out
a visitor consent form

04:52.893 --> 04:54.993
for a minor child.
For my son.

04:55.026 --> 04:56.593
OFFICER: We'll need
a certified birth certificate

04:56.626 --> 04:57.826
before he can come in.

04:57.860 --> 04:59.226
Then it'll be at least
a month after that.

04:59.260 --> 05:00.866
Wait a second.

05:00.900 --> 05:02.633
I can't see my son
for a month?

05:02.666 --> 05:05.066
When you see the shrink,
get meds.

05:05.100 --> 05:06.200
Most of the girls
here are on

05:06.233 --> 05:07.666
at least one antidepressant.

05:09.766 --> 05:11.366
He can also give you
a dental dam.

05:11.400 --> 05:12.633
Excuse me?

05:12.666 --> 05:14.766
If you get involved
with anyone,

05:14.800 --> 05:16.400
better to be safe
than sorry.

05:17.766 --> 05:19.800
You've been assigned
to janitorial.

05:19.833 --> 05:20.933
DOLE: I asked to clerk
in the law library.

05:20.966 --> 05:21.766
OFFICER: They all do.

05:21.800 --> 05:23.466
It goes to the senior girls.

05:23.500 --> 05:26.133
But I'm a lawyer.

05:26.166 --> 05:28.033
Ms. Dole,

05:28.066 --> 05:29.333
part of your adjustment here

05:29.366 --> 05:31.900
is learning that what
you were before doesn't matter.

05:36.133 --> 05:37.433
Look, if you don't
like the brief--

05:37.466 --> 05:38.800
I didn't say
I didn't like it.

05:38.833 --> 05:40.433
I just think
we short-shrifted

05:40.466 --> 05:41.733
the Merits a little.

05:41.766 --> 05:43.433
An appeal isn't
about the Merits.

05:43.466 --> 05:44.200
DONNELL: Just the same,

05:44.233 --> 05:45.466
it would be nice
to have them

05:45.500 --> 05:47.000
emotionally predisposed.

05:47.033 --> 05:48.766
Justice Leon's wife
was the victim

05:48.800 --> 05:49.833
of violent crime.

05:49.866 --> 05:51.100
It's not a bad idea
to tickle

05:51.133 --> 05:52.066
that nerve a little

05:52.100 --> 05:53.333
by reminding them

05:53.366 --> 05:55.066
who Lindsay shot.

05:56.300 --> 05:58.600
I'm only talking about
two more paragraphs.

05:59.100 --> 05:59.973
Okay.

06:07.040 --> 06:08.073
She's feeling it a little.

06:08.106 --> 06:09.206
DONNELL: Was this a mistake?

06:09.240 --> 06:10.306
YOUNG: She'll be okay.

06:10.340 --> 06:11.973
Nerves usually
make her better.

06:12.006 --> 06:13.173
(door opens)

06:14.840 --> 06:15.973
(door closes)

06:16.006 --> 06:17.373
I've got a problem.

06:19.173 --> 06:21.806
I represent a woman,
Melissa Halpern,

06:21.840 --> 06:22.706
who kidnapped a child

06:22.740 --> 06:24.540
16 years ago.
I heard.

06:24.573 --> 06:26.673
BERLUTI: Well,
you probably also heard

06:26.706 --> 06:28.873
the police arrested
somebody else,

06:28.906 --> 06:30.240
Bernice White.

06:30.273 --> 06:32.540
In fact, they arrested her
'cause of me, and--

06:32.573 --> 06:34.206
Jimmy, can you just cut
to the problem?

06:34.240 --> 06:35.273
We're a little busy here.

06:35.773 --> 06:37.406
Fine.

06:37.440 --> 06:38.873
Bernice White confessed.

06:41.206 --> 06:42.440
Excuse me?

06:42.473 --> 06:44.373
They must have interrogated
her half the night.

06:44.406 --> 06:47.306
I don't know, but she signed
a written confession.

06:47.340 --> 06:49.140
For a crime
she didn't commit?

06:49.173 --> 06:50.206
Yes.

06:51.473 --> 06:54.506
Bobby, this is all my doing.

06:55.606 --> 06:57.240
I'd like to represent Bernice.

06:57.273 --> 06:58.073
How can you do that?

06:58.106 --> 06:59.073
You represent Melissa.

06:59.106 --> 07:00.913
I won't violate
any privilege.

07:00.946 --> 07:02.780
But, Jimmy,
there's a conflict.

07:02.813 --> 07:04.246
It's in your client's
best interest

07:04.280 --> 07:05.580
for the police
to continue thinking

07:05.613 --> 07:07.146
Bernice White
is the kidnapper.

07:07.180 --> 07:08.246
And I'm not gonna do much

07:08.280 --> 07:10.146
to change their minds
on that,

07:10.180 --> 07:11.913
but I can still
help her beat it

07:11.946 --> 07:14.080
without compromising
Melissa Halpern.

07:14.113 --> 07:15.413
That's crazy, Jimmy!

07:15.446 --> 07:16.513
BERLUTI: I can't just sit

07:16.546 --> 07:18.013
and do nothing here!

07:18.046 --> 07:19.446
That woman's gonna
go to prison

07:19.480 --> 07:21.280
for a crime
she didn't commit!

07:21.313 --> 07:23.446
I put all of it
in motion.

07:23.480 --> 07:25.546
I can't just--

07:27.113 --> 07:29.146
if I promise not
to do anything

07:29.180 --> 07:31.213
against Melissa Halpern's
interests?

07:34.413 --> 07:36.746
You get her consent first.

07:37.646 --> 07:39.380
She has to waive
the conflict.

07:39.413 --> 07:40.746
Okay.
Great.

07:40.780 --> 07:41.946
And take Jamie with you.

07:41.980 --> 07:43.380
I want her there.
Why?

07:43.413 --> 07:45.013
DONNELL: Because you're seem
a little nearsighted, Jimmy.

07:45.046 --> 07:46.380
I want back up.
I don't--

07:46.413 --> 07:49.280
DONNELL: You take
Jamie with you.

07:49.313 --> 07:52.246
(music playing)

07:59.786 --> 08:01.620
She confessed?

08:01.653 --> 08:03.186
That's the good news.

08:03.220 --> 08:05.053
The bad is she says
she doesn't know

08:05.086 --> 08:06.886
where your daughter is.

08:06.920 --> 08:08.420
Well, what did she
do with her?

08:08.453 --> 08:10.153
She claims
she doesn't remember.

08:11.186 --> 08:13.620
Look, now that
we have the confession,

08:13.653 --> 08:14.686
we've got some leverage

08:14.720 --> 08:15.753
to work on her.

08:16.653 --> 08:17.586
Sally, it's early.

08:17.620 --> 08:18.886
Give us some time.

08:18.920 --> 08:21.586
SALLY: I don't care
if you make a deal, Helen.

08:21.620 --> 08:24.520
I don't care whether
or not she goes to prison.

08:25.853 --> 08:27.720
I want to see my daughter.

08:32.220 --> 08:33.720
Represent her?

08:33.753 --> 08:35.620
Bernice White?
You have my word--

08:35.653 --> 08:36.620
It'll give me away.

08:36.653 --> 08:38.120
I promise you,
it won't.

08:38.153 --> 08:40.053
It'll have nothing
to do with you.

08:40.086 --> 08:42.785
I won't be saying I know
who the real kidnapper is.

08:42.820 --> 08:44.186
I will be defending
her straight

08:44.220 --> 08:45.286
as if you didn't exist.

08:45.320 --> 08:47.220
Why can't she just get
another lawyer?

08:47.253 --> 08:49.853
She could,
but the reality is,

08:49.886 --> 08:51.820
any other lawyer's
gonna think she did it,

08:51.853 --> 08:54.286
and the defense
will reflect that.

08:54.320 --> 08:56.186
I want it to be me.

08:58.420 --> 08:59.660
And why is she here?

08:59.693 --> 09:02.093
Because as complicated
as it is,

09:02.126 --> 09:03.593
we feel two attorneys...

09:03.626 --> 09:04.560
Here's my card.

09:04.593 --> 09:05.726
Look, she doesn't
need your card.

09:06.760 --> 09:08.860
Melissa,
I know you don't want

09:08.893 --> 09:10.360
Bernice White going to jail.

09:10.760 --> 09:12.293
One of the reasons
you came to me

09:12.326 --> 09:14.093
was to spare some
of her suffering.

09:14.126 --> 09:16.393
I don't wanna be going to jail,
either, Jimmy.

09:16.426 --> 09:19.093
I won't betray you
in any way.

09:20.160 --> 09:21.393
Hey, Mr. Berluti.

09:21.760 --> 09:22.660
Hey, Joey.

09:23.926 --> 09:25.060
Still working on the will?

09:27.226 --> 09:28.093
And who's this?

09:28.126 --> 09:29.960
Oh, I'm Jamie Stringer.

09:29.993 --> 09:31.926
I--
She works with us.

09:36.826 --> 09:38.060
Why do I get the feeling

09:38.093 --> 09:40.293
that there's this big secret?

09:40.993 --> 09:42.593
There's no secret,
sweetheart.

09:42.626 --> 09:44.126
Grown-ups draft wills.

09:44.160 --> 09:46.160
It's just one
of the boring things

09:46.193 --> 09:47.226
they have to do.

09:48.726 --> 09:49.660
Okay.

09:54.460 --> 09:55.393
A month,
they're saying,

09:55.426 --> 09:56.326
before she can see him.

09:56.360 --> 09:57.726
I got to tell him tonight

09:57.760 --> 09:59.566
he won't see his mother
until Halloween.

09:59.600 --> 10:00.966
Bobby, it's prison rules.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.933
Look, I don't have
any jurisdiction

10:02.966 --> 10:04.700
or even influence
for that matter.

10:04.733 --> 10:06.566
There's got to be
a string you can pull.

10:06.600 --> 10:08.400
Well, I don't have it.

10:08.433 --> 10:10.800
Look, your best option
is to go to the court

10:10.833 --> 10:12.100
and ask that she be allowed

10:12.133 --> 10:12.933
to attend her appeal.

10:12.966 --> 10:14.866
We struck out there.

10:14.900 --> 10:16.000
Come on, Helen.

10:17.233 --> 10:18.133
I'll try.

10:21.000 --> 10:22.000
(sighs) Thanks.

10:24.233 --> 10:24.900
You know,

10:29.000 --> 10:30.900
you have a client,

10:30.933 --> 10:31.933
Bernice White,

10:31.966 --> 10:32.966
kidnapped a baby

10:33.000 --> 10:34.500
16 years ago.

10:35.166 --> 10:36.366
If she were to tell us

10:36.400 --> 10:38.500
what she did
with that baby,

10:39.766 --> 10:41.366
I think the office
could find a way

10:41.400 --> 10:43.166
to let Lindsay visit
with your son.

10:43.200 --> 10:45.000
Playing one case
off another--

10:45.033 --> 10:47.300
GAMBLE: I'm not playing
one case off of another.

10:47.333 --> 10:49.500
You're in here looking
for a special favor.

10:49.533 --> 10:51.933
It's going to be hard
for me to accomplish that

10:51.966 --> 10:53.866
considering the disfavor
your firm

10:53.900 --> 10:56.333
is held in here.

10:56.366 --> 10:58.266
All I'm saying is,
if you were to do something

10:58.300 --> 10:59.673
to cultivate
a little goodwill,

10:59.706 --> 11:01.206
it could help Lindsay.

11:01.240 --> 11:03.673
I am not going to discuss

11:03.706 --> 11:05.740
that other case.

11:05.773 --> 11:08.640
I'm only here
to discuss Lindsay,

11:08.673 --> 11:10.306
who in addition
to being my wife,

11:10.340 --> 11:12.706
is also one
of your best friends.

11:15.606 --> 11:18.140
Like I said,
I'll try.

11:25.340 --> 11:26.606
Why did you say
you did it?

11:26.640 --> 11:28.373
I don't know.

11:28.406 --> 11:30.273
I just wanted them
to leave me alone.

11:30.306 --> 11:32.506
I couldn't take it anymore,
and then they said

11:32.540 --> 11:33.773
that if I gave them
what they wanted,

11:33.806 --> 11:34.506
I'd go home.

11:34.540 --> 11:35.940
Let you go?

11:35.973 --> 11:37.506
WHITE: And then the woman,
she said they'd be lenient,

11:37.540 --> 11:39.440
and then the detective
came back in

11:39.473 --> 11:42.340
and he said
that if I confessed

11:42.373 --> 11:43.140
that he'd help me.

11:44.340 --> 11:46.240
And I was so--
I was so tired,

11:46.273 --> 11:47.273
I believed him.

11:47.306 --> 11:49.440
The police said
if you confessed,

11:49.473 --> 11:50.906
they'd release you?

11:52.406 --> 11:53.640
Yes.

11:55.273 --> 11:57.206
Shouldn't the first step
be a motion to recuse?

11:57.240 --> 11:58.373
No.
I really think--

11:58.406 --> 12:00.213
Can I have a second?

12:00.246 --> 12:00.980
(sighs)

12:01.013 --> 12:02.046
One minute.

12:06.113 --> 12:07.013
You lied to her.

12:07.046 --> 12:08.580
I'm allowed to do that.

12:08.613 --> 12:10.580
You're not allowed
to manufacture evidence, Helen.

12:10.613 --> 12:12.013
I didn't.
Who's this woman

12:12.046 --> 12:13.680
she supposedly
gave the baby to?

12:16.113 --> 12:17.146
I've already
marked up a motion

12:17.180 --> 12:18.380
to suppress the confession.

12:18.413 --> 12:20.146
Well, there's a stunner.

12:20.180 --> 12:21.513
You'd be?
I'm Jamie--

12:21.546 --> 12:22.913
She doesn't care.
GAMBLE: Listen, Jimmy,

12:22.946 --> 12:23.946
you wanna make a deal?

12:23.980 --> 12:25.580
Tell me where the girl is,

12:25.613 --> 12:27.280
otherwise, don't bother.

12:27.313 --> 12:29.413
You crossed a line, Helen.

12:29.446 --> 12:31.346
I'm going right into court.
GAMBLE: Fine,

12:31.380 --> 12:32.746
I'll see you there.

12:32.780 --> 12:33.480
Debbie.

12:33.780 --> 12:35.346
Jamie.

12:35.746 --> 12:38.346
Jimmy, technically,
you didn't disclose

12:38.380 --> 12:39.446
to Bernice White
that you represent

12:39.480 --> 12:40.280
Melissa Halpern.

12:40.313 --> 12:41.113
BERLUTI: I don't need to.

12:41.146 --> 12:42.413
You don't need to?

12:42.446 --> 12:43.813
It's Legal Ethics 101.

12:43.846 --> 12:45.013
The law is black and white.

12:45.046 --> 12:46.513
Jamie,

12:46.546 --> 12:49.246
practical lesson
number one,

12:49.280 --> 12:51.346
it's never black and white.

12:57.246 --> 12:59.113
Helen somehow got it done.

12:59.146 --> 13:00.020
So I can attend?

13:00.520 --> 13:01.353
You can be there.

13:01.386 --> 13:02.953
Great.

13:04.186 --> 13:06.053
So, how's your first day going?

13:07.753 --> 13:10.286
Seems everybody here
is a killer.

13:10.320 --> 13:11.686
I ran into two
former clients,

13:11.720 --> 13:12.786
so at least
I'm making friends.

13:12.820 --> 13:13.853
(chuckles softly)

13:17.720 --> 13:18.586
Did you read the brief?

13:18.620 --> 13:21.520
Yeah, I think it's great.

13:21.553 --> 13:23.153
Is Rebecca really
the one to argue?

13:23.186 --> 13:25.153
She's never even appeared
before the appeals court.

13:25.186 --> 13:26.420
This is the S. J. C.

13:26.453 --> 13:27.786
I wouldn't let her do it

13:27.820 --> 13:29.020
If I didn't believe in her.

13:31.320 --> 13:32.520
She's ready.

13:37.020 --> 13:39.053
(door opens)

13:39.086 --> 13:40.053
Hey.

13:40.086 --> 13:42.120
Hey.

13:42.153 --> 13:43.620
Ellenor and I were thinking

13:43.653 --> 13:45.320
let's do a moot
court tonight.

13:45.353 --> 13:46.520
We'll play the judges.

13:46.553 --> 13:48.186
That way,
you can practice on us,

13:48.220 --> 13:49.686
and we'll try
to pick you apart.

13:49.720 --> 13:51.020
Okay.

13:52.386 --> 13:53.053
(exhales sharply)

13:54.120 --> 13:56.220
This seemed like a good idea
when I asked for this.

13:56.253 --> 13:57.553
It was a good idea.

13:57.586 --> 13:59.153
It still is.

13:59.186 --> 14:00.493
The only thing
to keep in mind

14:00.526 --> 14:02.626
is the Supreme Judicial Court.

14:03.293 --> 14:04.793
Don't let your passion
get the best of you.

14:04.826 --> 14:07.393
The first thing they always
look for is deference.

14:07.426 --> 14:08.793
If they're mistaken,

14:08.826 --> 14:11.026
just tell them how justified
the mistake is.

14:11.060 --> 14:12.193
Then correct them.

14:13.426 --> 14:14.393
Okay.

14:16.393 --> 14:18.593
YOUNG: Hey,
you stepped up for this

14:18.626 --> 14:20.860
because you know
you're the lawyer

14:20.893 --> 14:21.793
for this job.

14:22.226 --> 14:23.226
Right.

14:26.126 --> 14:27.926
GAMBLE: I am allowed
to trick suspects.

14:27.960 --> 14:30.126
We have been through
this before, Your Honor.

14:30.160 --> 14:31.893
It goes beyond trickery,
Your Honor.

14:31.926 --> 14:34.960
They kept interrogating her
for six hours.

14:34.993 --> 14:36.726
Then, after
she's half-delirious

14:36.760 --> 14:38.226
with fatigue and fear,

14:38.260 --> 14:40.626
they feed her
this psychoamnesia crap

14:40.660 --> 14:42.793
about how she blocked
out the crime.

14:42.826 --> 14:44.726
Then they tell her
she can go home

14:44.760 --> 14:46.060
if she confesses.

14:46.093 --> 14:48.826
Then they tell her they've got
this phantom witness.

14:48.860 --> 14:50.193
They had her half-believing

14:50.226 --> 14:51.826
maybe she did commit
the crime

14:51.860 --> 14:53.360
she knows she didn't commit.

14:53.393 --> 14:55.393
This went beyond coercion.

14:55.426 --> 14:57.226
Trickery is constitutional.

14:57.260 --> 14:58.926
You shouldn't even
be arguing.

14:58.960 --> 15:00.766
You're a witness in what
happened in that room.

15:00.800 --> 15:02.200
Fine. Recuse me.

15:02.233 --> 15:04.233
We can bring in
somebody else.

15:04.266 --> 15:06.000
My client was also
represented

15:06.033 --> 15:06.933
by counsel, Your Honor.

15:06.966 --> 15:09.533
No, your client
repeatedly maintained

15:09.566 --> 15:10.766
you were not her lawyer.

15:10.800 --> 15:14.000
Your Honor, the reason
Bernice White was arrested

15:14.033 --> 15:15.833
was because
the police believed her

15:15.866 --> 15:16.733
to be my client.

15:16.766 --> 15:20.200
They, in fact,
arrested her in my office.

15:20.233 --> 15:21.833
So for the prosecution
to now claim

15:21.866 --> 15:24.233
Ms. White was not represented
by counsel

15:24.266 --> 15:26.200
is blatant bad faith.
KITTLESON: Wait a second.

15:26.233 --> 15:28.466
Did you represent her
or not?

15:28.833 --> 15:30.633
At that time, no.

15:30.666 --> 15:32.266
KITTLESON:
So the prosecution is right.

15:32.300 --> 15:33.500
She wasn't represented

15:33.533 --> 15:34.933
at the time
of the interrogation.

15:34.966 --> 15:36.633
They got the wrong one here!

15:36.666 --> 15:38.566
That's a jury question.

15:38.600 --> 15:41.100
If this goes to a jury
with a confession,

15:41.133 --> 15:41.766
she's gone.

15:41.800 --> 15:43.333
Juries think confessions

15:43.366 --> 15:44.800
are the truth,
and they're not.

15:44.833 --> 15:46.533
Was this interrogation
videotaped?

15:46.566 --> 15:47.533
Yes.

15:48.100 --> 15:49.400
I wanna see it.

15:49.433 --> 15:50.900
All of it, Ms. Gamble.

15:50.933 --> 15:51.966
I'll watch the tape.

15:52.000 --> 15:53.533
then I'll make my ruling.

15:53.566 --> 15:55.500
The defendant
stays in custody.

15:55.533 --> 15:56.433
We're adjourned.

15:56.466 --> 15:57.133
(gavel bangs)

15:57.166 --> 16:01.040
(music playing)

16:01.073 --> 16:03.140
I'll call you as soon
as I hear anything.

16:03.573 --> 16:04.373
Okay.

16:08.006 --> 16:09.606
GAMBLE: Look,
I'm still willing

16:09.640 --> 16:11.106
to play ball
if she tells us

16:11.140 --> 16:13.040
where the girl is.

16:13.073 --> 16:16.006
(music playing)

16:26.140 --> 16:27.806
REBECCA: And we maintain
the jury instructions

16:27.840 --> 16:28.840
were flawed.

16:28.873 --> 16:30.873
In so far as the judge
failed to advise

16:30.906 --> 16:33.473
that lethal force
may be justified,

16:33.506 --> 16:35.406
even against unarmed victims

16:35.440 --> 16:38.140
when the defendant believes
her life is in danger.

16:38.173 --> 16:40.073
Did you submit your own
jury instruction?

16:40.106 --> 16:40.873
Yes, Your Honor,

16:40.906 --> 16:41.873
we timely submitted

16:41.906 --> 16:43.240
our proposed jury instructions,

16:43.273 --> 16:44.840
which Judge West rejected.

16:44.873 --> 16:47.273
FRUTT: And what was
your proposal on lethal force?

16:47.306 --> 16:50.706
Referring the court to page...

16:50.740 --> 16:52.740
You have to have it
ready, Rebecca.

16:52.773 --> 16:54.473
You get 20 minutes, tops.

16:54.506 --> 16:56.473
YOUNG: You need to know
the transcripts and pleadings.

16:56.506 --> 16:58.040
I can't feed them to you.

16:58.073 --> 16:59.546
Okay.

17:00.613 --> 17:02.013
You're raising
a wheat violation?

17:02.046 --> 17:02.780
Yes, Your Honor.

17:02.813 --> 17:03.980
Your client waived that.

17:04.012 --> 17:05.480
REBECCA: That would be
assuming Ms. Dole

17:05.512 --> 17:07.079
had the capacity to waive it.

17:07.113 --> 17:08.579
Is there anything
in the record

17:08.613 --> 17:10.579
that goes to her
mental incapacity?

17:10.613 --> 17:12.313
Yes, Your Honor.
Referring the court to...

17:12.346 --> 17:14.180
You have to have it ready!

17:14.213 --> 17:14.880
Okay!

17:17.780 --> 17:19.546
You can't use that tone.

17:19.579 --> 17:20.846
I know.

17:23.713 --> 17:24.613
(sighs)

17:30.946 --> 17:32.113
Is Jimmy still here?

17:32.146 --> 17:33.280
No, actually.

17:34.580 --> 17:35.946
Melissa,
I thought we agreed

17:35.980 --> 17:36.880
it wasn't a good idea

17:36.913 --> 17:37.780
for you to come here.

17:37.813 --> 17:39.546
I just wanted
to know how things

17:39.580 --> 17:41.280
went today with the hearing.

17:41.313 --> 17:44.280
Oh. The judge took it
under advisement.

17:44.913 --> 17:46.646
And if the confession
is suppressed,

17:46.680 --> 17:48.646
Ms. White will be
let go, right?

17:48.680 --> 17:49.913
We hope so.

17:51.080 --> 17:51.880
(sighs)

17:53.580 --> 17:54.646
I called Jimmy at home.

17:54.680 --> 17:56.046
There was no answer.

17:56.080 --> 17:58.413
If he checks in,
would you have him call me?

17:58.446 --> 17:59.486
Sure.

17:59.520 --> 18:02.453
(music playing)

18:03.720 --> 18:04.886
Good night.

18:05.320 --> 18:06.220
Night.

18:21.128 --> 18:22.128
Sit.

18:22.161 --> 18:23.628
(door closes)

18:25.128 --> 18:26.561
(sighs)

18:28.261 --> 18:29.295
You ready?

18:29.328 --> 18:30.628
I am so ready.

18:30.661 --> 18:34.195
You really need to hammer
prosecutorial misconduct.

18:34.228 --> 18:35.228
I plan to.

18:35.261 --> 18:37.528
Even if we win here
and get a remand,

18:37.561 --> 18:39.328
it's not going to do
Lindsay much good.

18:40.195 --> 18:42.728
At retrial, we'll be stuck
with her former testimony,

18:42.761 --> 18:45.795
which means we can't really
argue self-defense.

18:45.828 --> 18:46.928
So what are you saying?

18:46.961 --> 18:48.828
I'm saying
we need to get

18:48.861 --> 18:51.195
a reversal with prejudice.

18:52.295 --> 18:53.795
Lindsay's best chance
at freedom

18:53.828 --> 18:54.995
is with the S. J. C.,

18:55.028 --> 18:56.261
not at a trial court,

18:56.295 --> 18:58.928
and the only way we get
a reversal with prejudice

18:58.961 --> 19:01.668
is prosecutorial misconduct.

19:02.035 --> 19:03.001
Okay.

19:05.101 --> 19:05.968
Anything else?

19:06.801 --> 19:08.568
Yes.

19:10.135 --> 19:11.401
I know you're nervous.

19:11.435 --> 19:14.335
It's quite natural
for you to be scared,

19:14.368 --> 19:15.635
intimidated,

19:15.668 --> 19:19.301
but what you need
to remember, Rebecca, is...

19:19.335 --> 19:21.301
there's a reason
why we picked you.

19:21.335 --> 19:23.801
Your advocacy skills,

19:23.835 --> 19:25.235
your command of the law,

19:25.268 --> 19:26.401
your passion.

19:27.468 --> 19:28.968
We all believe in you.

19:30.368 --> 19:32.101
Lindsay does.

19:32.135 --> 19:33.235
Most of all,

19:35.801 --> 19:36.835
I do.

19:39.235 --> 19:40.301
Thank you.

19:42.201 --> 19:43.835
Off we go.

19:43.868 --> 19:44.668
(sighs)

19:46.268 --> 19:47.301
(sighs)

19:47.335 --> 19:50.268
(music playing)

19:54.935 --> 19:56.368
MAN: All rise.

20:02.041 --> 20:03.308
MAN: Be seated.

20:07.375 --> 20:08.675
Stand up, Ms. Gamble.

20:11.341 --> 20:13.841
I watched that tape,

20:13.875 --> 20:15.308
and once again,

20:15.341 --> 20:17.175
I find myself disgusted

20:17.208 --> 20:18.608
by your tactics.

20:19.508 --> 20:20.975
Trickery and deceit

20:21.008 --> 20:23.408
may pass constitutional muster,

20:23.441 --> 20:25.475
but it gives you,

20:25.508 --> 20:27.308
this court,

20:27.341 --> 20:29.475
and the concept of honor

20:29.508 --> 20:31.441
a very black eye.

20:32.108 --> 20:34.641
I hear you complain
all the time

20:34.675 --> 20:36.908
about the erosion
of public trust,

20:36.941 --> 20:39.175
and yet,
your own behavior

20:39.208 --> 20:41.108
puts no value on it.

20:42.975 --> 20:44.941
Go stand in the corner.

20:45.941 --> 20:47.008
I beg your pardon?

20:47.041 --> 20:48.641
KITTLESON: You heard me.

20:48.675 --> 20:50.141
Go in that corner and stand.

20:52.208 --> 20:53.908
Face in.

20:55.508 --> 20:57.208
Your Honor,
with all due respect

20:57.241 --> 20:58.641
to your authority
in this room--

20:58.675 --> 21:00.348
You'll feel the extent
of that authority

21:00.381 --> 21:01.848
if you defy it, counsel.

21:01.881 --> 21:04.148
I'm not about--
March yourself

21:04.181 --> 21:05.381
into that corner now,

21:05.415 --> 21:07.348
or you go to a jail cell!

21:07.381 --> 21:10.315
(music playing)

21:21.681 --> 21:22.815
KITTLESON: Mr. Berluti,

21:22.848 --> 21:25.181
your client
was not represented

21:25.215 --> 21:26.415
by counsel at the time

21:26.448 --> 21:27.448
of this interrogation.

21:28.181 --> 21:30.681
She had no time asked
for a lawyer,

21:30.715 --> 21:32.948
and however deceived,

21:32.981 --> 21:34.748
tired,
and badgered

21:34.781 --> 21:35.681
she may have been,

21:35.715 --> 21:37.948
there is no indication
that her statement

21:37.981 --> 21:39.315
wasn't voluntary.

21:39.348 --> 21:40.648
The confession,

21:40.681 --> 21:44.081
however putridly obtained,

21:44.648 --> 21:46.048
therefore, stands.

21:47.248 --> 21:49.681
The defendant
will stay in custody.

21:49.715 --> 21:50.915
We're adjourned.

21:50.948 --> 21:51.648
(gavel bangs)

21:51.681 --> 21:53.681
(music playing)

22:16.855 --> 22:18.488
I represent the real kidnapper.

22:19.221 --> 22:20.255
This is ex parte.

22:20.288 --> 22:21.788
It isn't Bernice White!

22:21.821 --> 22:23.721
Get out of here!
BERLUTI: If she goes to trial

22:23.755 --> 22:25.188
with a confession,
she's gone--

22:25.221 --> 22:26.288
KITTLESON:
You are one sentence away

22:26.321 --> 22:28.488
from the jail cell
Helen Gamble almost got.

22:28.521 --> 22:30.788
This is ex parte,

22:30.821 --> 22:32.321
highly improper!

22:32.355 --> 22:33.255
I will disregard it

22:33.288 --> 22:35.421
in its entirety and ask
for your bar card

22:35.455 --> 22:37.188
if you utter another syllable!

22:39.321 --> 22:40.888
Convince your other client

22:40.921 --> 22:42.255
to turn herself in if you want,

22:42.288 --> 22:44.088
but don't you dare come to me.

22:50.088 --> 22:50.855
Jimmy...

22:52.255 --> 22:54.221
(sighs)

22:54.255 --> 22:55.221
Nothing.

22:55.255 --> 22:56.288
Go.

23:00.161 --> 23:01.095
What?

23:02.861 --> 23:04.961
I was about to say

23:06.595 --> 23:08.195
on a more personal note.

23:11.028 --> 23:12.161
How are you?

23:14.795 --> 23:15.728
Fine.

23:17.128 --> 23:18.061
How are you?

23:20.061 --> 23:21.361
I'm, um...

23:24.661 --> 23:25.595
okay.

23:28.795 --> 23:31.728
(music playing)

23:36.028 --> 23:38.695
(door closes)

23:38.728 --> 23:41.661
(music playing)

24:00.101 --> 24:01.935
WASHINGTON:
May it please the court,

24:01.968 --> 24:04.101
my name is Rebecca Washington,

24:04.135 --> 24:05.701
and I represent the appellant,

24:05.735 --> 24:06.801
Lindsay Dole,

24:06.835 --> 24:08.401
in the matter
of the Commonwealth

24:08.435 --> 24:09.835
vs. Dole.

24:09.868 --> 24:12.101
You are in receipt
of our appellate brief,

24:12.135 --> 24:13.601
and I would like
to address the court

24:13.635 --> 24:15.635
on several issues outlined

24:15.668 --> 24:16.968
in that document.

24:17.001 --> 24:18.501
First,

24:18.535 --> 24:20.068
during trial,

24:20.101 --> 24:21.935
The Commonwealth referred
to the fact

24:21.968 --> 24:24.101
that Ms. Dole initially chose
to speak

24:24.135 --> 24:25.635
with lawyers
instead of the police

24:25.668 --> 24:26.701
the night of the shooting.

24:27.401 --> 24:29.835
Ms. Dole, like any criminal
defendant,

24:29.868 --> 24:31.935
had the constitutional right

24:31.968 --> 24:33.768
not to speak to the police.

24:33.801 --> 24:35.535
A constitutional right

24:35.568 --> 24:37.501
to confer with attorneys,

24:37.535 --> 24:40.035
and it was reversible error

24:40.068 --> 24:42.801
for Mr. Walsh to use
the exercising

24:42.835 --> 24:44.068
of those rights

24:44.101 --> 24:45.501
as evidence against her.

24:45.535 --> 24:46.835
Was an objection made

24:46.868 --> 24:48.168
on those grounds at trial?

24:48.201 --> 24:49.401
Yes, Your Honor.

24:49.435 --> 24:50.668
Ms. Frutt objected.

24:50.701 --> 24:51.868
Actually, she objected

24:51.901 --> 24:54.168
that the question sought
privileged information,

24:54.201 --> 24:56.368
not that the question
was unconstitutional.

24:56.401 --> 24:57.601
WASHINGTON:
Even if the objection

24:57.635 --> 24:58.968
was legally flawed,

24:59.001 --> 25:00.641
Mr. Walsh went further.

25:00.675 --> 25:03.008
He argued
that Ms. Dole's decision

25:03.041 --> 25:04.908
to speak with her lawyers was,

25:04.941 --> 25:06.808
and I quote,

25:06.841 --> 25:09.008
"Consistent with the behavior

25:09.041 --> 25:10.608
of guilty people."

25:10.641 --> 25:12.475
Ms. Frutt didn't object to that.

25:12.508 --> 25:14.775
We maintained Judge West,

25:14.808 --> 25:16.175
nevertheless,
should've struck

25:16.208 --> 25:17.941
the statement sua sponte.

25:17.975 --> 25:18.775
Moreover,

25:18.808 --> 25:20.508
Mr. Walsh made other errors.

25:20.541 --> 25:22.108
He argued that the shooting

25:22.141 --> 25:23.641
was part of a pattern,

25:23.675 --> 25:24.808
that my client

25:24.841 --> 25:26.975
and her husband
were in the habit

25:27.008 --> 25:29.108
of killing clients.

25:29.141 --> 25:32.408
Can't the prosecution use
character evidence

25:32.441 --> 25:34.175
to impeach a defense witness?

25:34.208 --> 25:35.641
Not if that evidence

25:35.675 --> 25:37.475
is overly prejudicial,

25:37.508 --> 25:38.841
and such character evidence,

25:38.875 --> 25:40.275
prejudicial or not,

25:40.308 --> 25:41.208
is inadmissible

25:41.241 --> 25:42.341
without prior notice.

25:42.375 --> 25:43.641
We never got that notice.

25:43.675 --> 25:45.375
And where's your objection
to that?

25:45.408 --> 25:46.908
WASHINGTON: If you refer
to the transcript,

25:46.941 --> 25:49.375
you'll see Ms. Frutt made
a timely objection

25:49.408 --> 25:51.041
once Mr. Walsh introduced

25:51.075 --> 25:53.041
the evidence concerning
Mr. Hinks.

25:53.075 --> 25:54.608
I see an objection going
to prejudice.

25:54.641 --> 25:56.041
I see nothing going to notice.

25:56.075 --> 25:57.741
It was a general objection,

25:57.775 --> 25:59.541
which under Massachusetts law--
JUDGE: You agree

25:59.575 --> 26:01.415
there was sufficient evidence

26:01.448 --> 26:03.015
to convict your client?

26:03.048 --> 26:04.215
WASHINGTON: We agree
the evidence

26:04.248 --> 26:06.281
might have supported
manslaughter,

26:06.315 --> 26:08.281
but not--
You don't deny she shot him?

26:08.315 --> 26:09.848
No, we do not.

26:09.881 --> 26:11.648
You just disagree
with the verdict?

26:11.681 --> 26:15.181
We maintain the trial
was unfair,

26:15.215 --> 26:16.881
that the prosecutor committed

26:16.915 --> 26:18.715
multiple reversible errors.

26:18.748 --> 26:21.081
JUDGE: Oh, did you ever move
for a mistrial?

26:21.115 --> 26:22.081
No,

26:22.115 --> 26:23.581
but under Massachusetts

26:23.615 --> 26:25.148
general law--
JUDGE: So basically,

26:25.181 --> 26:26.515
you took your shot,
and you're here

26:26.548 --> 26:28.381
because you don't like
the result?

26:29.915 --> 26:31.981
I'm here because
of something called

26:32.015 --> 26:33.915
the Fifth Amendment.

26:33.948 --> 26:36.048
I'm here because
of something called

26:36.081 --> 26:37.715
the Sixth Amendment.

26:37.748 --> 26:40.081
Basic Constitutional Rights

26:40.115 --> 26:41.448
belonging to Lindsay Dole

26:41.481 --> 26:42.881
that the prosecutor

26:42.915 --> 26:44.515
blatantly trampled.

26:44.548 --> 26:45.848
We're not talking

26:45.881 --> 26:47.481
about subtle shades of gray

26:47.515 --> 26:49.281
where a civil liberty or two

26:49.315 --> 26:51.215
was encroached upon.

26:51.248 --> 26:52.481
He plowed over them

26:52.515 --> 26:54.915
with a tank.

26:54.948 --> 26:57.448
Mr. Walsh showed contempt

26:57.481 --> 26:58.648
for the constitution.

26:59.215 --> 27:00.388
He had no regard

27:00.421 --> 27:02.488
for fundamental civil liberties,

27:02.521 --> 27:03.755
and I'm here today

27:03.788 --> 27:04.788
under the assumption

27:04.821 --> 27:06.121
that the seven of you do.

27:06.155 --> 27:07.655
Lectures...

27:07.688 --> 27:09.455
aren't generally effective.

27:11.121 --> 27:12.155
And I wouldn't presume

27:12.188 --> 27:13.988
to lecture you,

27:14.021 --> 27:15.688
but I will use part of my time

27:15.721 --> 27:18.221
to enter indignation
into the record

27:18.255 --> 27:19.688
because I think a lack of it

27:19.721 --> 27:21.421
is part of the problem.

27:21.821 --> 27:23.155
Police lie today.

27:23.188 --> 27:24.888
So do prosecutors,

27:24.921 --> 27:27.188
and it doesn't so much as raise
a judicial eyebrow

27:27.221 --> 27:29.688
because it goes on all the time.

27:29.721 --> 27:31.255
Everybody's jaded.

27:31.288 --> 27:33.455
It doesn't shock
anybody's conscience,

27:33.488 --> 27:34.788
and I'm here saying

27:34.821 --> 27:36.155
it should shock yours.

27:36.188 --> 27:39.188
This man wanted
his verdict.

27:39.221 --> 27:41.288
He said, "Forget the Bill
of Rights."

27:41.321 --> 27:42.788
And he's hoping

27:42.821 --> 27:45.521
you cop the same attitude.

27:45.555 --> 27:48.388
I am here hoping otherwise.

27:50.421 --> 27:53.355
(music playing)

28:01.428 --> 28:03.761
STRINGER: It's not my place
to second-guess you.

28:03.795 --> 28:05.028
Then why are you about to?

28:05.061 --> 28:07.595
Because you have violated
so many ethical rules.

28:07.628 --> 28:08.761
The conflict of interests.

28:08.795 --> 28:10.661
You charge in to see
a judge ex parte.

28:10.695 --> 28:13.728
Lucy tells me you even used
to sleep with this judge.

28:13.761 --> 28:17.028
I never said for her
to tell you I told her that.

28:18.528 --> 28:20.228
You forget we have
squeal laws.

28:20.261 --> 28:22.428
Technically,
I'm obligated to report

28:22.461 --> 28:23.895
to the bar all of this.

28:23.928 --> 28:25.061
Then why don't you do that?

28:25.095 --> 28:26.828
I'm not looking to do that.

28:26.861 --> 28:28.128
Then what do you want, Jamie?

28:28.161 --> 28:29.995
Why are you being
so mean to me?

28:30.028 --> 28:32.961
(music playing)

28:37.195 --> 28:38.628
Look,

28:38.661 --> 28:40.528
I made a mistake

28:40.561 --> 28:44.495
that resulted
in a person being arrested

28:44.528 --> 28:46.128
for a crime she didn't commit.

28:48.828 --> 28:49.995
The likelihood is,

28:50.028 --> 28:52.095
I can't undo that mistake.

28:52.128 --> 28:53.495
She's going to prison.

28:55.161 --> 28:57.361
I don't mean to be acting out
against you,

28:58.695 --> 29:00.568
but--

29:00.601 --> 29:02.535
well, you're there.

29:05.868 --> 29:07.301
I'm sorry.

29:07.335 --> 29:10.301
(music playing)

29:15.368 --> 29:17.735
Trials need to be fair,

29:17.768 --> 29:18.668
not perfect.

29:18.701 --> 29:21.135
Even if some of my questions
went too far

29:21.168 --> 29:23.801
and I make no such concession,

29:25.135 --> 29:26.335
it was harmless error.

29:26.368 --> 29:27.868
Oh, come on, Mr. Walsh.

29:27.901 --> 29:29.135
You raise another murder

29:29.168 --> 29:30.468
and link the defendant to it?

29:30.501 --> 29:32.401
WALSH: As Your Honor
correctly noted,

29:32.435 --> 29:35.435
we linked Bobby Donnell to it,
a witness.

29:35.468 --> 29:38.068
We have every right to impeach.
Well, you called it a pattern,

29:38.101 --> 29:40.035
and you also linked it
to Lindsay Dole.

29:40.068 --> 29:42.201
The jury was instructed
that the lawyers' questions

29:42.235 --> 29:43.535
and arguments are not evidence.

29:43.568 --> 29:44.568
Still, it's a little hard

29:44.601 --> 29:46.068
to un-ring a bell, isn't it?

29:46.101 --> 29:48.235
Moreover, Ms. Frutt didn't ask

29:48.268 --> 29:49.801
for any curative instructions.

29:49.835 --> 29:51.668
She didn't move for a mistrial.

29:51.701 --> 29:52.868
They're raising things here

29:52.901 --> 29:54.468
they effectively waived.

29:54.501 --> 29:55.701
What about your introducing

29:55.735 --> 29:57.468
your own personal beliefs?

29:57.501 --> 29:59.068
In your opening,
you said

29:59.101 --> 30:01.175
you wouldn't have shot the man.

30:01.208 --> 30:02.575
If that was improper--

30:02.608 --> 30:03.641
It was.

30:04.975 --> 30:07.508
Then I would again ask
where's the harm?

30:07.541 --> 30:08.675
I think we can assume

30:08.708 --> 30:10.041
that the jury assumed going in

30:10.075 --> 30:11.175
I wouldn't have shot the man.

30:11.208 --> 30:13.908
My saying it hardly made
much noise.

30:13.941 --> 30:16.308
You think you took
the high road here, Mr. Walsh?

30:17.008 --> 30:17.675
The high road?

30:17.708 --> 30:18.741
Yes.

30:20.175 --> 30:21.841
My answer to that would be,

30:21.875 --> 30:25.275
murder trials are typically
low roads.

30:25.308 --> 30:27.041
They get ugly,

30:27.075 --> 30:28.308
often personal.

30:28.908 --> 30:29.908
Not that the doctrine

30:29.941 --> 30:31.575
of unclean hands is applicable,

30:31.608 --> 30:32.941
but let's look at some

30:32.975 --> 30:34.641
of the defense
counsel's tactics.

30:34.675 --> 30:36.308
Those aren't in issue here.

30:36.341 --> 30:38.308
They are as a context to mine,

30:38.341 --> 30:39.908
and--
JUDGE: It would be a mistake

30:39.941 --> 30:42.508
to focus on defense conduct.

30:44.541 --> 30:45.875
My actions...

30:45.908 --> 30:47.408
did not cause Lindsay Dole

30:47.441 --> 30:49.641
to be convicted of murder.

30:49.675 --> 30:52.108
Her actions lead to that result.

30:52.508 --> 30:54.408
She received a fair trial.

30:54.441 --> 30:56.475
She had an army of attorneys.

30:56.508 --> 30:58.308
She got a better defense

30:58.341 --> 31:00.081
than most defendants.

31:00.115 --> 31:02.281
The jury heard all the evidence,

31:02.315 --> 31:03.815
they were properly instructed,

31:03.848 --> 31:06.781
and they made
their unanimous finding.

31:07.748 --> 31:10.515
Ms. Dole lost,

31:10.548 --> 31:11.815
and this court

31:11.848 --> 31:14.448
cannot disregard a verdict

31:14.481 --> 31:17.181
merely because
it disagrees with it.

31:17.215 --> 31:20.315
(music playing)

31:20.915 --> 31:22.548
BERLUTI: They'll assign
a trial date.

31:22.581 --> 31:23.781
We go from there.

31:23.815 --> 31:25.648
Jamie will keep you updated

31:25.681 --> 31:27.648
on all the pretrial
developments.

31:27.681 --> 31:29.515
You can call her or me anytime.

31:29.548 --> 31:30.681
Okay.

31:30.715 --> 31:32.581
We're not going to give up.

31:32.615 --> 31:33.448
I promise you that.

31:39.181 --> 31:40.615
Why are you being so kind?

31:41.581 --> 31:43.615
Because I know you're innocent.

31:43.648 --> 31:45.581
And because you feel
responsible?

31:47.381 --> 31:49.948
I know the real kidnapper
is your client.

31:49.981 --> 31:52.148
I read the newspapers.

31:52.648 --> 31:53.481
Like you said,

31:53.515 --> 31:55.048
it's why I was arrested.

31:57.348 --> 31:59.755
Why can't you just tell
the police who she is?

32:00.421 --> 32:02.121
Because I can't.

32:02.155 --> 32:03.521
I'll do almost anything else,

32:03.555 --> 32:04.788
but I can't do that.

32:04.821 --> 32:05.788
Yes, you can.

32:05.821 --> 32:07.055
You mean you won't.

32:09.688 --> 32:11.088
I won't.

32:12.688 --> 32:15.221
I'm gonna be convicted.

32:15.255 --> 32:16.321
We all know it.

32:17.255 --> 32:18.655
And you won't tell.

32:21.288 --> 32:23.721
That must be very hard
to live with.

32:26.188 --> 32:27.655
Is it?

32:36.818 --> 32:38.051
Has anybody seen Jamie?

32:38.085 --> 32:40.285
HATCHER: She said something
about an appointment.

32:40.318 --> 32:42.218
Please let her know
she's expected

32:42.251 --> 32:43.685
to check in with us.

32:44.951 --> 32:46.385
Ellenor,

32:46.418 --> 32:48.218
can I see you a second
in my office?

33:02.158 --> 33:04.391
You know that I know

33:04.425 --> 33:07.691
you tried an excellent case.

33:07.725 --> 33:08.958
But judging from the questions

33:08.991 --> 33:10.725
the Supreme Court put to Bec,

33:10.758 --> 33:13.591
we think they think

33:13.625 --> 33:14.791
there was inadequate counsel.

33:16.325 --> 33:17.958
They were group mistakes.

33:17.991 --> 33:20.025
No, they were mine.

33:20.058 --> 33:21.791
They were trial blunders.

33:21.825 --> 33:23.025
The decisions were--
FRUTT: Bobby,

33:23.058 --> 33:24.258
I was at the S. J. C.

33:24.291 --> 33:26.825
I heard the questions.

33:26.858 --> 33:28.425
They were trial mistakes.

33:28.458 --> 33:30.058
(sighs)

33:30.091 --> 33:31.858
YOUNG: We're going to start
preparing an appeal

33:31.891 --> 33:34.525
on ineffective assistance.

33:34.558 --> 33:36.058
It might be too late, but...

33:36.091 --> 33:38.925
We feel we need
to try everything.

33:38.958 --> 33:41.391
I don't disagree
with your decision, Bobby.

33:42.491 --> 33:43.591
Anything else?

33:46.858 --> 33:47.791
No.

33:54.958 --> 33:56.158
(door closes)

34:07.531 --> 34:09.465
(door bell rings)

34:12.898 --> 34:15.598
STRINGER: Ms. Halpern,
May I speak to you?

34:15.630 --> 34:17.231
I won't take very long.

34:25.565 --> 34:26.764
First off,

34:26.797 --> 34:28.598
let me assure you I am not here

34:28.630 --> 34:30.297
at the request of Mr. Berluti.

34:31.797 --> 34:33.297
He'll probably want me fired

34:33.331 --> 34:34.297
when he finds out.

34:34.331 --> 34:36.231
Then why are you here?

34:37.130 --> 34:39.197
Well,

34:39.231 --> 34:42.231
I've been pretty much
an observer on this case,

34:42.264 --> 34:44.465
but from my observations,

34:46.864 --> 34:48.731
I think it's only a matter
of time.

34:49.431 --> 34:52.398
Ms. Stringer, if they haven't
found me after 16 years,

34:52.431 --> 34:53.665
I hardly think--
STRINGER: I don't mean

34:53.697 --> 34:54.431
the police.

34:54.465 --> 34:56.264
I mean you.

34:57.465 --> 34:58.431
I think you're inching

34:58.465 --> 34:59.705
towards turning yourself in,

35:01.771 --> 35:03.738
whether it's showing up in court

35:03.771 --> 35:04.638
or coming to our office

35:04.671 --> 35:06.671
even when we tell you not to.

35:06.705 --> 35:08.171
Even by seeking out the victims

35:08.205 --> 35:09.271
to give them money,

35:09.305 --> 35:10.505
you were putting something

35:10.538 --> 35:12.938
in motion.
I can't live in jail.

35:13.938 --> 35:15.738
Obviously you're having
difficulty

35:15.771 --> 35:17.438
with the way things are now,

35:18.371 --> 35:20.105
and when Bernice White
starts serving

35:20.138 --> 35:23.438
a 25-year-to-life term,

35:23.471 --> 35:25.671
you will never live with that.

35:25.705 --> 35:28.171
(music playing)

35:33.871 --> 35:35.538
I'm not trying to talk you

35:35.571 --> 35:36.838
into anything.

35:37.471 --> 35:39.905
I'm only encouraging you
to hurry

35:39.938 --> 35:42.605
to the place you're already
headed for,

35:43.238 --> 35:45.138
for Bernice White's sake

35:45.171 --> 35:47.138
and...

35:47.171 --> 35:48.805
I guess, your own.

35:51.338 --> 35:52.605
(door opens)

35:54.305 --> 35:55.738
Hey.

35:55.771 --> 35:56.738
Hi.

35:56.771 --> 35:58.338
What are you doing here?

36:00.878 --> 36:02.978
Oh, I just needed
to get some signatures.

36:03.011 --> 36:04.845
Signatures on what?

36:11.078 --> 36:12.811
Actually,

36:12.845 --> 36:14.645
we were discussing a crime

36:16.445 --> 36:18.745
I committed 16 years ago.

36:24.578 --> 36:26.178
It's a two-prong test.

36:26.211 --> 36:28.345
First, we have to prove
that our representation

36:28.378 --> 36:30.611
was measurably below that
of an ordinary lawyer.

36:30.645 --> 36:32.678
YOUNG: What's measurably?
WASHINGTON: It's like

36:32.711 --> 36:34.111
the definition on obscenity.

36:34.145 --> 36:35.178
They know it when they see it.

36:35.211 --> 36:36.411
And the second prong?

36:36.445 --> 36:38.911
But for our incompetence,

36:38.945 --> 36:40.178
Lindsay would've been acquitted.

36:40.211 --> 36:42.445
Oh, that's gonna be tough
to prove.

36:43.478 --> 36:45.611
Bobby, clerk's office, S. J. C.

36:45.645 --> 36:48.745
(music playing)

36:56.678 --> 36:57.778
Hello. This is Bobby Donnell.

36:57.811 --> 36:59.278
Why didn't they call me?

36:59.311 --> 37:00.651
Shh!
Shh yourself.

37:01.051 --> 37:02.051
Yes.

37:04.051 --> 37:04.984
Uh-huh.

37:11.751 --> 37:12.684
Thank you.

37:18.518 --> 37:21.185
Based on Fifth and Sixth
Amendment violations,

37:24.618 --> 37:26.685
Lindsay's conviction
has been...

37:28.018 --> 37:28.951
reversed.

37:33.318 --> 37:35.785
They've ordered a new trial.

37:39.918 --> 37:40.918
Thank you.

37:41.818 --> 37:43.085
It wasn't everything we wanted.

37:43.118 --> 37:45.018
But it's a chance.

37:48.085 --> 37:49.018
Thank you.

37:51.018 --> 37:53.951
(music playing)

37:57.751 --> 37:59.691
(door closes)

38:01.991 --> 38:02.891
Congratulations.

38:09.225 --> 38:10.125
I don't give a damn.

38:10.158 --> 38:11.425
That isn't true.

38:11.458 --> 38:14.858
WALSH: Hey, it gives me a chance
to beat them twice.

38:14.891 --> 38:16.991
Truth be told, I hate
that firm so much,

38:17.025 --> 38:20.025
just the opportunity
to stick it to 'em twice,

38:20.058 --> 38:22.791
suddenly, there's something
to get juiced for.

38:22.825 --> 38:24.325
They'll never win a retrial.

38:24.358 --> 38:25.925
You watch, they'll come crawling

38:25.958 --> 38:27.091
looking to plead.

38:27.125 --> 38:28.458
Forget it.

38:28.491 --> 38:30.191
She's never getting out
of prison.

38:30.225 --> 38:30.858
Never.

38:30.891 --> 38:32.858
You sound a little rabid.

38:33.758 --> 38:35.825
I know you like
those people, Helen.

38:35.858 --> 38:37.858
I don't.

38:37.891 --> 38:39.525
They're the pricks in my side.

38:39.558 --> 38:41.425
I think you mean thorns.

38:41.458 --> 38:43.158
(knock on door)

38:43.458 --> 38:46.325
(indistinct chatter)

38:46.358 --> 38:47.291
Helen,

38:49.158 --> 38:51.058
we went to your office.

38:51.091 --> 38:52.258
They said you were here.

38:54.891 --> 38:57.191
This is Melissa Halpern.

38:57.225 --> 38:59.565
She's the person who kidnapped

38:59.598 --> 39:02.831
Sally Burns' baby 16-years ago.

39:02.865 --> 39:05.798
(music playing)

39:29.698 --> 39:31.365
It's over.

39:31.398 --> 39:32.165
You're free.

39:33.598 --> 39:35.998
The real kidnapper came forward.

39:36.031 --> 39:37.931
It'll be in the papers tomorrow.

39:41.331 --> 39:42.265
Thank you.

39:44.731 --> 39:46.965
I didn't mean to usurp anybody.

39:46.998 --> 39:47.665
(file-cabinet drawer slams)

39:48.398 --> 39:49.698
You're an associate.

39:49.731 --> 39:51.665
You take the assignments
we give you.

39:51.698 --> 39:53.131
You do not get creative.

39:53.165 --> 39:55.131
You do not go to clients
behind our backs.

39:55.165 --> 39:56.598
I knew it was something Jimmy--

39:56.631 --> 39:57.598
You don't make excuses

39:57.631 --> 39:58.698
when you know what you did
was wrong.

39:58.731 --> 39:59.738
I'm sorry!

40:02.705 --> 40:05.638
Oh, is it that not the approved
associate tone?

40:06.705 --> 40:08.538
This isn't going to work
if that's the attitude

40:08.571 --> 40:09.538
you're coming in with.

40:11.505 --> 40:12.838
I knew that what I was doing

40:12.871 --> 40:16.038
was unconventional and risky.

40:17.571 --> 40:20.505
But I saw something
in this woman,

40:20.538 --> 40:22.371
and I really thought
I could help.

40:24.438 --> 40:26.105
Next time,

40:26.138 --> 40:27.538
you check with us first.

40:28.038 --> 40:29.038
Okay.

40:32.371 --> 40:33.771
DONNELL: Square one, forensics,

40:33.805 --> 40:35.338
psychiatrists, ballistics.

40:35.371 --> 40:36.871
We go through it
like it's the first time.

40:36.905 --> 40:38.038
What are you expecting to find?

40:38.071 --> 40:39.438
Something.

40:39.471 --> 40:41.338
We have to have something new

40:41.371 --> 40:42.138
for the second trial.

40:42.171 --> 40:43.205
Who's trying it?

40:43.238 --> 40:45.271
Either outside counsel
or Eugene.

40:45.305 --> 40:46.371
I haven't decided yet.

40:48.205 --> 40:49.205
Are we switching theories?

40:49.238 --> 40:50.338
I don't know.

40:50.371 --> 40:51.605
We can't go self-defense

40:51.638 --> 40:53.238
since the prior testimony
comes in.

40:53.271 --> 40:54.838
What else is there?
YOUNG: It's got to be

40:54.871 --> 40:56.438
straight insanity.
There's nothing else.

40:56.471 --> 40:57.738
What about the phone call

40:57.771 --> 40:58.871
when she sounded so calm?

40:58.905 --> 41:00.078
Post-traumatic shock.

41:02.278 --> 41:03.644
Nobody's saying
it's gonna be easy,

41:03.678 --> 41:05.144
but insanity is all we got.

41:05.178 --> 41:07.378
We have to pore through
the transcripts,

41:07.411 --> 41:08.678
every word.

41:08.711 --> 41:11.311
Somewhere there has to be
something we can use.

41:11.344 --> 41:12.544
We've got our new trial.

41:12.578 --> 41:14.544
Now we have to win it.

41:18.244 --> 41:19.744
Bobby, I know you don't
wanna hear this,

41:19.778 --> 41:21.178
but we need to consider a plea.

41:21.211 --> 41:23.011
No!
YOUNG: We won't win this trial.

41:23.044 --> 41:24.211
With her prior testimony,

41:24.244 --> 41:25.311
they have a stronger case.

41:25.344 --> 41:26.578
We're not pleading, Eugene.

41:26.611 --> 41:27.378
End of discussion.

41:29.244 --> 41:30.878
The assignment for everybody

41:30.911 --> 41:33.978
is to figure out a way to win.

41:35.844 --> 41:38.278
Straight not guilty.

41:38.311 --> 41:41.244
(music playing)

42:01.618 --> 42:03.551
(door opens)

42:11.351 --> 42:12.284
Sally?

42:14.451 --> 42:15.384
This is Joey.

42:18.584 --> 42:20.118
Joey,

42:20.151 --> 42:21.084
Sally.

42:32.251 --> 42:33.218
Hello.

42:36.151 --> 42:37.084
Hi.

42:55.384 --> 42:58.318
(music playing)

43:19.824 --> 43:20.924
WOMAN: You stinker!

43:22.891 --> 43:25.658
(music playing)
