01:20.400 --> 01:22.934
Oh, why doesn't
somebody move this?

01:27.434 --> 01:28.934
Hi!
Hi!

01:28.969 --> 01:30.701
Have you seen Al?

01:30.736 --> 01:32.601
Too many times.

01:32.636 --> 01:35.033
I can't believe
he's not here yet.

01:35.068 --> 01:37.167
Oh, don't worry.
I'm sure he's okay.

01:37.202 --> 01:38.901
Who cares if he's okay?

01:38.936 --> 01:40.534
We've got 25 minutes

01:40.569 --> 01:43.000
to get to the closing
of Johnny B. Goode's.

01:43.035 --> 01:44.767
They're tearing it
down tomorrow morning.

01:44.802 --> 01:46.334
The burger place?

01:46.369 --> 01:48.334
Oh, it is much more
than a burger place.

01:48.369 --> 01:49.834
They've got fries.

01:49.869 --> 01:52.334
You know,
it's really a shame

01:52.369 --> 01:55.334
that they would tear down
a landmark like that.

01:55.369 --> 01:58.367
People come from miles around
just to get a burger...

01:58.402 --> 02:00.868
and to look at the grease
stain on the wall

02:00.903 --> 02:03.634
where Al used
to rest his head.

02:03.669 --> 02:06.400
And to think some people
waste their time

02:06.435 --> 02:08.067
going to Yellowstone.

02:08.102 --> 02:11.067
It's really gonna be
a night to remember.

02:11.102 --> 02:13.067
After all the people
who have tickets get in,

02:13.102 --> 02:14.834
they're gonna
close all the doors.

02:14.869 --> 02:18.067
Then people all over town
are gonna honk their horns

02:18.102 --> 02:19.567
in a fond farewell.

02:19.602 --> 02:22.934
Sort of like Al does
in a funeral procession.

02:22.969 --> 02:26.400
It sounds like you've got
a lot of memories there.

02:26.435 --> 02:27.868
More than
anywhere else.

02:27.903 --> 02:29.367
After all,
it's where I met

02:29.402 --> 02:32.901
the man I wanted to spend
the rest of my life with.

02:32.936 --> 02:35.267
And I met Al there too.

02:36.467 --> 02:38.567
Where could he be?
Oh, well.

02:38.602 --> 02:39.968
He wouldn't miss this.

02:40.003 --> 02:43.567
This is one of the few places
that still lets him in.

02:43.602 --> 02:46.267
So I see you're all ready
for your big night.

02:46.302 --> 02:47.434
Well...

02:47.469 --> 02:49.367
it's not just
my big night.

02:49.402 --> 02:51.400
I hope my dinner
party goes well.

02:51.435 --> 02:53.501
See, if I get the
manager's position

02:53.536 --> 02:55.067
at Kyoto National,

02:55.102 --> 02:57.667
then Steve is in line
for my old job at our bank.

02:57.702 --> 03:00.200
I was hoping they'd
give it to a woman,

03:00.235 --> 03:02.968
but out of respect for Steve,
I'm staying neutral.

03:03.003 --> 03:04.834
That's nice.

03:04.869 --> 03:06.701
It was so
nice of you to let us

03:06.736 --> 03:08.934
keep our poached salmon
in your refrigerator.

03:08.969 --> 03:10.567
Ours was so full already.

03:10.602 --> 03:12.567
Al didn't touch it,
did he?

03:12.602 --> 03:15.601
No. He actually liked
having it around.

03:15.636 --> 03:18.100
He said it gave
the refrigerator

03:18.135 --> 03:20.200
kind of a foody smell.

03:20.235 --> 03:23.300
Well, I'm off
to cement our future.

03:24.467 --> 03:25.501
Oh!

03:30.968 --> 03:32.467
Look at my dress!

03:32.502 --> 03:33.968
Look at my fish!

03:34.003 --> 03:35.467
Look at my floor!

03:35.502 --> 03:38.000
I've got to go home
and change.

03:38.035 --> 03:40.501
Keep an eye
on my fish.

03:40.536 --> 03:43.000
It's keeping
an eye on you.

03:43.035 --> 03:44.033
Oh!

03:45.667 --> 03:47.000
Oh, my God!

03:47.035 --> 03:48.968
The bankers
just pulled up.

03:49.003 --> 03:50.334
You sure it's not Al?

03:50.369 --> 03:52.434
Al doesn't drive
a Mercedes

03:52.469 --> 03:54.934
with the license
plate "YEN MEN."

03:54.969 --> 03:57.367
I can't go over there
like this!

03:57.402 --> 03:59.901
You could wear
something of mine.

03:59.936 --> 04:02.467
<i>Maybe I can go
over there like this.</i>

04:02.502 --> 04:05.467
No, I can wash this out by hand
and throw it in your dryer.

04:05.502 --> 04:07.200
That should only take
15 minutes.

04:07.235 --> 04:08.501
What about your company?

04:08.536 --> 04:10.501
Oh, Steve can stall
for that long.

04:10.536 --> 04:12.534
He'll just show them
our river-rafting slides.

04:12.569 --> 04:14.133
Got any Woolite?

04:14.168 --> 04:18.500
Oh, yeah. I got some
as a gag gift for my birthday.

04:18.536 --> 04:20.601
It's upstairs
in the bathroom.

04:20.636 --> 04:21.834
Thanks!

04:21.869 --> 04:23.334
You can keep it,

04:23.369 --> 04:25.467
but just leave me the bow.

04:27.667 --> 04:29.934
Al...

04:29.969 --> 04:32.100
loves...

04:32.135 --> 04:34.767
Peggy.

04:34.802 --> 04:38.300
Sorry I'm late,
but I was in such a rush,

04:38.335 --> 04:39.667
I sideswiped a car

04:39.702 --> 04:41.667
parked out in front
of Steve and Marcie's house.

04:41.702 --> 04:44.200
Well, if they can afford
to buy a Mercedes,

04:44.235 --> 04:47.067
they can afford
to pay for it.

04:47.102 --> 04:48.400
Didn't you leave a note?

04:48.435 --> 04:52.734
Sure I did. I said,
"Next time, buy American."

04:52.769 --> 04:54.234
Come on, Peg, hurry up.

04:54.269 --> 04:55.934
We gotta get
to the restaurant.

04:55.969 --> 04:58.167
We're in the group
that's going in first.

04:58.202 --> 04:59.534
Number eight.

04:59.569 --> 05:02.801
You're kidding. How did you
get such a low number?

05:02.836 --> 05:04.434
You know how Bud's
always complaining

05:04.469 --> 05:06.167
I don't let him
stay out late enough?

05:06.202 --> 05:08.667
So I told him he could sleep
on the sidewalk last night

05:08.702 --> 05:11.067
at Johnny B. Goode's,
and he got us number eight.

05:11.102 --> 05:13.133
Bud wasn't home
last night?

05:13.168 --> 05:17.968
Oh, well. At least he was
doing something worthwhile.

05:18.003 --> 05:20.968
Man, I'm starved.
I can't wait to sink my teeth

05:21.003 --> 05:22.667
into one of those burgers
one last time,

05:22.702 --> 05:23.767
and those great fries.

05:23.802 --> 05:25.167
I still hold
the record.

05:25.202 --> 05:27.434
I think I can still eat
10 bags in one sitting.

05:27.469 --> 05:29.901
Oh, you are great, honey.

05:32.801 --> 05:34.300
It stinks in here.

05:34.335 --> 05:36.300
What's that thing?

05:36.335 --> 05:37.901
Oh, that's Marcie's fish.

05:37.936 --> 05:39.534
She spilled it
on her dress.

05:39.569 --> 05:41.501
She's upstairs
washing it out

05:41.536 --> 05:44.300
Look.
I wrote you something.

05:44.335 --> 05:45.834
Aww...

05:45.869 --> 05:49.100
"Al loves Piggy."

05:49.135 --> 05:51.133
That ought to be
an E, Al.

05:51.168 --> 05:52.434
I'll fix it.

05:52.469 --> 05:53.901
I think I got
the stain out.

05:55.834 --> 05:58.868
Oh, Al, I didn't know
you were here.

05:58.903 --> 06:00.701
Well, there goes
my appetite...

06:02.400 --> 06:04.000
and my favorite towel.

06:04.035 --> 06:07.033
Marcie, I'll put that
in the dryer for you.

06:11.000 --> 06:13.667
Who's been playing
in my fish?

06:13.702 --> 06:15.767
Let's go! Let's go!
Let's go!

06:15.802 --> 06:18.100
After they get past number
eight, we can't get in!

06:18.135 --> 06:19.667
Oh, I'm ready, Al.

06:19.702 --> 06:22.167
I'm sorry, Marce,
but we gotta go.

06:22.202 --> 06:24.534
I'll be okay. Does the dryer
buzz when it's finished?

06:24.569 --> 06:25.901
How would I know?

06:27.234 --> 06:29.400
Let's go! Let's go!
Let's go!

06:29.435 --> 06:31.901
Okay! Okay! Okay!

06:33.200 --> 06:34.701
My life is over.

06:34.736 --> 06:36.200
That's nice, honey.

06:36.235 --> 06:39.200
If you're hungry, there's
sandwiches on the table

06:39.235 --> 06:41.734
and little fish bits
on the floor.

06:41.769 --> 06:43.601
Life stinks.

06:43.636 --> 06:45.601
Yeah, well, it doesn't
get any better.

06:45.636 --> 06:47.968
We'll be at
Johnny B. Goode's.

06:48.003 --> 06:49.534
Wait a minute, Al.

06:49.569 --> 06:52.868
We can't go
with Kelly like this.

06:52.903 --> 06:53.934
Why not?

06:53.969 --> 06:55.534
Life will stink
tomorrow.

06:55.569 --> 06:57.334
I know mine will.

06:59.033 --> 07:00.434
All right.

07:00.469 --> 07:01.968
Kelly, this usually
takes an hour.

07:02.003 --> 07:03.968
I say,
"What's the matter?"

07:04.003 --> 07:06.400
You say, "Nothing."
I say, "Come on, honey,

07:06.435 --> 07:07.968
I know something's
wrong. What is it?"

07:08.003 --> 07:09.467
You say, "Nothing."

07:09.502 --> 07:11.901
So let's cut the crap.
What's wrong?

07:11.936 --> 07:13.067
Nothing.

07:13.102 --> 07:15.234
Come on, honey,

07:15.269 --> 07:17.534
I know something's wrong.
What is it?

07:17.569 --> 07:20.467
And keep in mind I haven't
eaten anything all day.

07:20.502 --> 07:21.534
Okay.

07:21.569 --> 07:22.767
Well, Judy's having a party

07:22.802 --> 07:23.968
for all the kids who count,

07:24.003 --> 07:25.133
and I wasn't invited.

07:25.168 --> 07:27.133
Well, honey, if they
were really friends-

07:27.168 --> 07:29.133
...they would have
invited you.

07:29.168 --> 07:30.367
Well, thanks
a lot, Mom.

07:30.402 --> 07:32.834
So what you're trying to tell me
is I have no friends.

07:32.869 --> 07:35.667
That's great. Why don't
you really cheer me up

07:35.702 --> 07:38.667
and tell me again
how lucky I am

07:38.702 --> 07:40.300
to have inherited
the Bundy forehead?

07:40.335 --> 07:41.767
I can't believe it.

07:41.802 --> 07:43.300
I just have to face it.

07:43.335 --> 07:44.601
I'm not popular anymore.

07:44.636 --> 07:47.968
And I've got the forehead
of a dolphin.

07:48.003 --> 07:50.400
Hey, that's
one smart fish.

07:50.435 --> 07:51.634
Oh, I'm ruined!

07:53.701 --> 07:56.033
Well, at least we'll know
where she is tonight.

07:56.068 --> 07:58.033
I'd better go up
and talk to her.

07:58.068 --> 07:59.534
Peg, we got number eight.

07:59.569 --> 08:01.534
We got seven minutes
to get there.

08:01.569 --> 08:03.534
If she starts crying,
give her some money.

08:03.569 --> 08:05.567
That always works
with you.

08:05.602 --> 08:07.234
I don't know.

08:07.269 --> 08:09.567
My parents never talked to me
when I had a problem,

08:09.602 --> 08:11.067
and I turned out fine.

08:11.102 --> 08:12.400
We're never gonna make it.

08:12.435 --> 08:13.901
I got an idea.

08:13.936 --> 08:16.400
Do you see a fish eye?

08:16.435 --> 08:19.267
No, but I see
a chicken leg.

08:24.133 --> 08:26.501
Hello, Johnny B. Goode's?
Who's this?

08:26.536 --> 08:28.701
Hey, Spike, it's Al.
You got a minute?

08:28.736 --> 08:31.801
<i>The hell with the
People magazineinterview.</i>

08:31.836 --> 08:33.167
You gotta do me a favor.

08:33.202 --> 08:34.701
You know my friend
Fat Charlie?

08:34.736 --> 08:36.200
Yeah, the fat one.

08:36.235 --> 08:39.234
He's got number 50,
and I got 8.

08:39.269 --> 08:41.234
Would you mind
if I traded with him?

08:41.269 --> 08:43.734
Great. Would you go out
in the parking lot and tell him?

08:43.769 --> 08:46.234
I'll get there
when I can, okay?

08:46.269 --> 08:47.734
Rock 'n' roll forever.

08:47.769 --> 08:49.434
Come on, Peg.

08:49.469 --> 08:51.234
The fries aren't
getting any younger.

08:51.269 --> 08:52.767
Neither are you.

08:52.802 --> 08:55.267
Marcie, I got three questions
for you.

08:55.302 --> 08:57.801
What are you doing
in a towel,

08:57.836 --> 09:00.734
what am I supposed to do
with the Takahashi brothers,

09:00.769 --> 09:03.601
and why didn't you tell me
you mixed our rafting slides in

09:03.636 --> 09:07.100
with the ones of your sister
giving birth to the twins?

09:07.135 --> 09:10.634
Well, number one,
I spilled.

09:10.669 --> 09:14.968
Number two, get out our camera
and ask them how to use it.

09:15.003 --> 09:16.601
And number three,

09:16.636 --> 09:19.701
it's for a lecture I'm giving
at our women's group,

09:19.736 --> 09:21.367
"Childbirth
and River Rafting:

09:21.402 --> 09:24.100
Two of Nature's
Bumpy Rides."

09:24.135 --> 09:26.200
Now go home,
go upstairs,

09:26.235 --> 09:28.701
get me a dress,
and hurry!

09:28.736 --> 09:29.868
Which dress?

09:29.903 --> 09:31.367
The power dress.

09:31.402 --> 09:32.400
Now, go!

09:35.067 --> 09:38.067
Peg, does the phrase,
"Hurry the hell up"

09:38.102 --> 09:39.667
mean anything to you?

09:39.702 --> 09:41.567
I've taken care
of everything.

09:41.602 --> 09:43.067
We are one phone call away

09:43.102 --> 09:45.601
from this whole thing
being settled.

09:47.135 --> 09:48.601
Hello.

09:48.636 --> 09:50.033
Kelly, it's for you!

09:51.501 --> 09:53.000
That should do it.

09:53.035 --> 09:54.501
Marcie,
make yourself at home.

09:54.536 --> 09:56.501
Watch TV if you'd like.

09:56.536 --> 09:58.501
Oh, and don't
pet the dog.

09:58.536 --> 10:00.868
He might expect it
from us.

10:03.167 --> 10:05.167
Come on, Peg.
Hurry up.

10:05.202 --> 10:06.667
<i>People magazine's
down there.</i>

10:06.702 --> 10:09.167
We might get
our picture taken.

10:09.202 --> 10:10.534
Oh! Oh! Oh!

10:14.267 --> 10:15.200
Come on!

10:16.334 --> 10:17.667
Mom!

10:17.702 --> 10:19.133
How could you?

10:19.168 --> 10:21.634
You made her mother
invite me?

10:21.669 --> 10:24.634
It was bad enough not being
invited in the first place.

10:24.669 --> 10:26.133
Now I'm the crybaby

10:26.168 --> 10:29.133
who had her mother call
and beg to invite the nerd.

10:29.168 --> 10:31.234
That's what I am now.
The nerd.

10:31.269 --> 10:34.133
I spent 15 years bleaching
and dying and piercing

10:34.168 --> 10:36.133
just to create
this awesome image,

10:36.168 --> 10:38.501
and it is shot to hell
with one phone call.

10:40.300 --> 10:41.367
Oh, Daddy!

10:44.467 --> 10:46.334
But I was number 50!

10:49.868 --> 10:50.934
Honey,

10:50.969 --> 10:53.701
I know how you're
feeling right now,

10:53.736 --> 10:56.701
but look, things aren't
as bad as they seem.

10:56.736 --> 10:58.200
Even nerds get married.

10:58.235 --> 10:59.701
Look at Marcie.

10:59.736 --> 11:03.701
Great. That's just how
I want to spend my life.

11:03.736 --> 11:06.701
Sitting there
in my natural hair color,

11:06.736 --> 11:08.067
fondling a dead fish.

11:10.968 --> 11:13.267
Let me handle this, Al.

11:13.302 --> 11:16.300
Kelly, honey, your friends
are mad at you now,

11:16.335 --> 11:17.834
but you'll
be a celebrity

11:17.869 --> 11:20.100
when they see the picture
of Daddy and me

11:20.135 --> 11:21.501
<i>in People magazine.</i>

11:21.536 --> 11:23.801
I'll be there with my hands
tied behind my back,

11:23.836 --> 11:25.267
eating bags of fries.

11:25.302 --> 11:27.067
Yeah, and I'll be
leading the crowd,

11:27.102 --> 11:30.767
cheering, "Chug a spud!
Chug a spud! Chug a spud!"

11:30.802 --> 11:34.234
Oh, how proud I'll be.

11:34.269 --> 11:36.834
Look, you guys go
and have a good time.

11:36.869 --> 11:38.133
I'll be okay.

11:38.168 --> 11:41.467
If I'm gonna be a nerd, fine.
I can deal with it.

11:41.502 --> 11:45.033
In fact, I'll start
practicing right now.

11:47.901 --> 11:51.567
Read any good books
lately, Mrs. Rhoades?

11:51.602 --> 11:54.467
As a matter of fact,
I have.

11:55.801 --> 11:57.934
<i>It's called
The Living Planet.</i>

11:57.969 --> 11:59.968
Would you kill me
with it, please?

12:01.367 --> 12:03.601
No, look,
you guys just go.

12:03.636 --> 12:05.100
I mean, after all,

12:05.135 --> 12:07.000
if I had a chance
to have fun,

12:07.035 --> 12:09.300
I wouldn't let one of your
problems stop me from going.

12:09.335 --> 12:11.200
Of course,
I'm not a parent.

12:13.200 --> 12:16.033
Our little Kelly
is really growing up, Al.

12:17.734 --> 12:19.100
Sit up, dear.

12:19.135 --> 12:22.100
That's how you get
the Bundy forehead.

12:22.135 --> 12:25.100
Come on, Peg. We're
running out of time!

12:25.135 --> 12:26.601
Hi, Dad. Mom.

12:26.636 --> 12:29.100
Honey, there's dinner
on the table

12:29.135 --> 12:31.267
right next to
your sister's head.

12:31.302 --> 12:33.567
Where'd you put my car?
What car?

12:33.602 --> 12:35.067
Dad, tonight's the finals

12:35.102 --> 12:36.901
for the Run 'em
and Wreck 'em Rally.

12:36.936 --> 12:39.434
I've got post position
in an hour.

12:39.469 --> 12:42.234
Are there gonna be
any nerds there? I'll come.

12:42.269 --> 12:45.434
You weren't invited,
Kel.

12:45.469 --> 12:48.300
Bud, are you sure
I promised you?

12:48.335 --> 12:50.367
Dad, you said
you'd fix it last night

12:50.402 --> 12:53.000
if I'd sit on the cold pavement
in front of Johnny B. Goode's

12:53.035 --> 12:56.501
with a bunch of sad old geezers
singing Beach Boys songs.

12:56.536 --> 12:58.000
But did I promise?

13:01.501 --> 13:02.868
Get the car, Bud.

13:05.133 --> 13:06.634
We're never
gonna make it.

13:06.669 --> 13:09.033
I probably don't have
enough time to fix the car.

13:09.068 --> 13:12.767
Here, Peg. You go
and have a good time.

13:12.802 --> 13:14.133
Aw, that's sweet, Al.

13:14.168 --> 13:15.868
But I can't go
without you.

13:15.903 --> 13:19.567
My memories of Johnny B. Goode's
are of us being together.

13:19.602 --> 13:21.133
I'm glad to hear
you say that.

13:21.168 --> 13:23.267
Because I had no intention
of giving you this ticket.

13:23.302 --> 13:25.067
Hurry up, Bud!

13:25.102 --> 13:26.667
Never wanted to get married.
I'm married.

13:26.702 --> 13:29.167
Never wanted to have kids.
I got two of them.

13:29.202 --> 13:31.501
How the hell
did this happen?

13:34.968 --> 13:36.534
Hello, Spike? Al.

13:36.569 --> 13:38.567
Listen,
is No-Jaw McKenzie there?

13:38.602 --> 13:41.067
Yeah, the one
with no jaw.

13:41.102 --> 13:42.567
Is she there?

13:42.602 --> 13:45.067
Great. Listen,
she's got number 110.

13:45.102 --> 13:49.000
Tell her I'll trade
my number 50 for it, okay?

13:49.035 --> 13:52.100
Yeah, thanks. Rock 'n' roll-
Yeah, something.

13:52.135 --> 13:53.934
Give me the car.

13:53.969 --> 13:55.701
Get out of my way.

13:57.501 --> 14:00.501
Nice to spend these father/son
moments together, Dad.

14:00.536 --> 14:03.167
Shut up.
I'm trying to read.

14:03.202 --> 14:05.167
Oh, great.
This is Japanese.

14:05.202 --> 14:06.667
Oh, here we go.

14:06.702 --> 14:08.667
<i>Uh, "Achtung!
Ihr hapft dikaf-"</i>

14:08.702 --> 14:10.167
These
aren't instructions.

14:10.202 --> 14:12.901
It's the history
of World War II.

14:14.100 --> 14:15.868
Oh, here it is.

14:15.903 --> 14:17.367
<i>Uh, "Attention.
Vous avez-"</i>

14:17.402 --> 14:20.234
Hell. More people
we should have killed.

14:21.534 --> 14:22.868
Where's American?

14:22.903 --> 14:24.367
Oh, here it is.

14:24.402 --> 14:25.868
Here it is.

14:25.903 --> 14:27.367
"Battery check before-

14:27.402 --> 14:29.868
To put cable on,
be sure-"

14:29.903 --> 14:31.868
Will you
hurry up, Al?

14:31.903 --> 14:34.868
Yeah, I'll quit lollygagging
here any minute.

14:34.903 --> 14:37.868
Bud, here. Put these
batteries in something.

14:37.903 --> 14:39.234
See if they work.

14:42.968 --> 14:45.734
Dad, can I ask you
something real quick?

14:45.769 --> 14:47.200
Yeah, okay. What?

14:47.235 --> 14:48.868
What's Mrs. Rhoades
doing in our living room

14:48.903 --> 14:50.000
wearing your favorite towel?

14:50.035 --> 14:51.901
You want to hear
a long, boring story

14:51.936 --> 14:53.367
about a short,
boring woman,

14:53.402 --> 14:55.601
or you want
your car fixed?

14:55.636 --> 14:58.667
All right.
"Put the red terminal

14:58.702 --> 15:01.934
<i>in the...
leconduizez."</i>

15:01.969 --> 15:04.434
Oh. My friends
the French again.

15:04.469 --> 15:06.501
"The conductor."

15:06.536 --> 15:09.567
Why don't they just say,
"Put the red wire in the hole"?

15:09.602 --> 15:12.701
Oh, here it is.
"Put the red wire in the hole."

15:12.736 --> 15:14.067
So typical.

15:14.102 --> 15:16.601
Over there solving
the male child's problems

15:16.636 --> 15:18.634
while your daughter
takes the back seat.

15:18.669 --> 15:20.968
You should be
used to that, Kel.

15:25.067 --> 15:29.067
I know there was a mix-up
in the maternity ward.

15:29.102 --> 15:31.067
Somewhere
in a game preserve,

15:31.102 --> 15:33.067
two orangutans
are picking lice

15:33.102 --> 15:35.601
off the head of my
real baby brother.

15:35.636 --> 15:37.033
Al, talk to Kelly.

15:37.068 --> 15:38.901
How was
your day, honey?

15:38.936 --> 15:40.734
You're standing
in my light, Kelly!

15:40.769 --> 15:41.934
Daddy...

15:41.969 --> 15:44.968
You wanted advice,
I gave you advice.

15:45.003 --> 15:47.934
You didn't want advice,
I left you alone.

15:47.969 --> 15:49.400
Ok. Here's my advice-

15:49.435 --> 15:51.167
I'm not a monkey.

15:51.202 --> 15:52.801
We know, son.

15:56.100 --> 15:57.934
Is my dress ready yet?

15:57.969 --> 15:59.300
For your body? No.

16:00.434 --> 16:02.934
I'll go check on it.

16:02.969 --> 16:05.934
Kelly, there were plenty
of parties I wasn't invited to

16:05.969 --> 16:07.434
when I was a kid.

16:07.469 --> 16:10.000
There's a mystery.

16:10.035 --> 16:13.367
Here's another- What the
hell's holding that towel up?

16:17.267 --> 16:19.434
So to continue, Kelly.

16:19.469 --> 16:20.934
I just showed up.

16:20.969 --> 16:23.934
I just stood there,
big smile on my face.

16:23.969 --> 16:25.467
I said, "I'm here"

16:25.502 --> 16:27.968
and went straight
for the food.

16:28.003 --> 16:30.267
They didn't want me,
but I had a great time.

16:30.302 --> 16:31.968
And if they didn't,
too bad.

16:32.003 --> 16:34.968
If you want
to be there, be there,

16:35.003 --> 16:36.968
even if they hate you.

16:37.003 --> 16:39.968
You're a Bundy.
Start acting like one.

16:40.003 --> 16:42.467
I'm going to my room.

16:42.502 --> 16:44.434
That's a girl,
go where you want to go.

16:44.469 --> 16:46.467
I'm taking the binoculars.

16:46.502 --> 16:48.467
If I can't be there,
at least I can see

16:48.502 --> 16:50.467
the lights from my room...

16:50.502 --> 16:53.667
If I can fit the strap
over my forehead.

16:55.133 --> 16:59.000
Dad, I sure hope you're better
at fixing cars than lives.

16:59.035 --> 17:00.367
You call these lives?

17:01.534 --> 17:03.000
Almost ready, Marce.

17:03.035 --> 17:06.000
How long does it take
to dry a dress?

17:06.035 --> 17:07.501
In the machine's defense,

17:07.536 --> 17:09.000
Al fixed that too.

17:09.035 --> 17:10.501
I have an announcement.

17:10.536 --> 17:11.666
Shut up.

17:11.702 --> 17:14.367
Where's Steve?

17:14.402 --> 17:16.200
How long does it take
to find a dress?

17:16.234 --> 17:19.000
It's not like he's
going through his stuff.

17:19.035 --> 17:22.000
His stuff has to be all
folded very carefully

17:22.035 --> 17:23.800
and neatly put away
in his drawers, all color-coded

17:23.836 --> 17:26.701
like his stupid socks.

17:26.736 --> 17:28.067
Does Al
have a sock drawer?

17:28.102 --> 17:29.367
Yeah. It's
called the floor.

17:31.367 --> 17:33.534
<i>Johnny B. Goode's
is sure hopping tonight.</i>

17:33.569 --> 17:34.534
Batteries work, Dad.

17:34.569 --> 17:35.868
Shh!

17:35.903 --> 17:38.701
<i>Yes, it's closing night
at Johnny B. Goode's,</i>

17:38.736 --> 17:41.033
<i>But we're having fun,
aren't we?</i>

17:41.068 --> 17:42.534
<i>Yeah!</i>

17:42.569 --> 17:44.000
<i>Now stand away from the doors.</i>

17:44.035 --> 17:45.400
<i>We're getting ready
to let people in</i>

17:45.435 --> 17:47.968
<i>with numbers
from 100 to 150.</i>

17:48.003 --> 17:50.467
Aw, Peg!
I traded for 110!

17:50.502 --> 17:51.968
What am I gonna do?

17:52.003 --> 17:53.968
I'll call
your friend Spike.

17:54.003 --> 17:56.467
And I'll tell him to trade
with my friend Easy Edie,

17:56.502 --> 17:59.968
you know, the one that turned
you down in high school?

18:00.003 --> 18:02.734
She's got number 198.

18:02.769 --> 18:06.501
<i>Okay, we're almost ready
for the fry-eating contest!</i>

18:06.536 --> 18:10.000
<i>Chug a spud! Chug a spud!
Chug a spud!</i>

18:10.035 --> 18:12.000
Those people
are morons, Dad.

18:12.035 --> 18:15.501
Give me the batteries.
I'm done with the car.

18:15.536 --> 18:18.000
What are all those
extra parts?

18:18.035 --> 18:19.501
They're-
they're extra parts,

18:19.536 --> 18:21.968
for Koreans
or something.

18:22.003 --> 18:24.367
Steve, where
have you been?

18:24.402 --> 18:26.334
I got halfway
out the back door,

18:26.369 --> 18:29.000
And Mr. Takahashi said,
"Hey, where you go?"

18:29.035 --> 18:31.000
So I couldn't
just leave.

18:31.035 --> 18:33.334
We started
talking baseball.

18:33.369 --> 18:35.000
Then we got into the sake.

18:35.035 --> 18:38.567
I wrote a haiku.

18:39.968 --> 18:41.033
Give me this.

18:41.068 --> 18:44.501
You call this
a power dress?

18:44.536 --> 18:46.534
I can't wear this
among bankers!

18:46.569 --> 18:49.434
I was in a hurry, I grabbed
the first thing I saw.

18:49.469 --> 18:51.501
I did that once,
that's how I got Peg.

18:53.934 --> 18:56.767
Marcie, there's nothing
wrong with that dress.

18:56.802 --> 18:59.934
Okay. We got number 198.

18:59.969 --> 19:01.767
Ooh! Nice dress.

19:03.934 --> 19:04.934
Sorry.

19:06.469 --> 19:08.934
Never mind.
My dress is dry.

19:08.969 --> 19:10.934
Go back
and stall them.

19:10.969 --> 19:12.467
Right. Uh, let's see.

19:12.502 --> 19:14.968
Ooh! They mentioned
their new Mercedes.

19:15.003 --> 19:17.667
I'll have them
show it to me.

19:17.702 --> 19:19.334
Ok! Here it is!

19:25.968 --> 19:27.334
There it goes.

19:28.467 --> 19:30.968
I saw that.

19:31.003 --> 19:32.968
Okay, okay, must be something
wrong with the batteries

19:33.003 --> 19:34.334
in the remote control.

19:34.369 --> 19:36.534
Are you sure it couldn't be
one of those extra parts.

19:36.569 --> 19:39.467
You said that about
our real car, didn't you Bud?

19:39.502 --> 19:40.968
And it's running fine.

19:41.003 --> 19:42.968
I mean, it's running good enough
that it can slam

19:43.003 --> 19:45.467
into a $40,000 Mercedes
and keep on going.

19:45.502 --> 19:48.934
<i>Chug a spud!
Chug a spud! Chug a spud!</i>

19:48.969 --> 19:51.934
<i>That's a record
so far tonight, eight bags.</i>

19:51.969 --> 19:55.934
<i>Once there was a guy
who could eat 10 bags-</i>

19:55.969 --> 19:57.434
<i>Al "The Pig" Bundy.</i>

19:57.469 --> 20:00.934
<i>He wouldn't pay for them,
but he'd eat them.</i>

20:00.969 --> 20:03.234
<i>Well, it looks like
they're going to be</i>

20:03.269 --> 20:05.434
<i>seating the last group
in about 10 minutes.</i>

20:05.469 --> 20:07.434
<i>That means
it's last call...</i>

20:07.469 --> 20:08.934
<i>For cholesterol!</i>

20:08.969 --> 20:12.434
<i>Remember, you can still
be a part of history.</i>

20:12.469 --> 20:15.934
<i>When we announce the doors
are closed for good,</i>

20:15.969 --> 20:18.968
<i>We want people all over Chicago
to honk their horns</i>

20:19.003 --> 20:21.834
<i>to say goodbye
to Johnny B. Goode's.</i>

20:27.968 --> 20:30.701
I wish I were dead.

20:30.736 --> 20:32.567
I wish I was blind.

20:35.467 --> 20:38.968
I guess I can just
kiss this job goodbye.

20:39.003 --> 20:42.467
They're trust their bank
to some harlot.

20:42.502 --> 20:45.467
I might as well
put on go-go boots

20:45.502 --> 20:47.801
and sing
Nancy Sinatra songs.

20:47.836 --> 20:49.400
Well, I like it.

20:49.435 --> 20:50.901
I think you
should be proud.

20:50.936 --> 20:53.133
Just go on in there
and show them what you got.

20:53.168 --> 20:55.400
That's how Peg got me.

20:55.435 --> 20:59.234
I'd never let any real people
see me in this.

20:59.269 --> 21:00.501
That's it!

21:00.536 --> 21:03.434
I just saw Judy's trying
to steal back the boyfriend

21:03.469 --> 21:04.934
I stole from her.

21:04.969 --> 21:07.934
I'm not letting her
get away with it.

21:07.969 --> 21:09.434
I'm a Bundy.

21:09.469 --> 21:11.434
I'm going right over there
and knock her teeth out.

21:11.469 --> 21:13.300
Nice dress,
Mrs. Rhoades.

21:15.434 --> 21:19.434
Well, if she can do it,
I can do it.

21:19.469 --> 21:21.934
I'm not a Bundy-
Thank God-

21:21.969 --> 21:24.434
But I'm going home
right now

21:24.469 --> 21:25.834
and getting that job.

21:28.167 --> 21:31.334
There. I think they were
just put in wrong.

21:38.501 --> 21:40.467
It's working.
Get out.

21:40.502 --> 21:41.634
Thanks, Dad.

21:41.669 --> 21:46.133
Peg, as much as I hate
to see you run, run.

21:46.168 --> 21:48.934
How much time
have we got, Al?

21:59.934 --> 22:01.934
Well, Johnny be gone.

22:01.969 --> 22:04.934
We just missed
the end of an era.

22:04.969 --> 22:05.801
Yep.

22:07.434 --> 22:09.934
Well, we'll start a new era.

22:09.969 --> 22:12.434
How? We don't
have any traditions.

22:12.469 --> 22:13.801
We're Bundys.

22:13.836 --> 22:15.934
We still have one tradition.

22:15.969 --> 22:17.501
Remember what
we used to do

22:17.536 --> 22:20.334
when we came back
from Johnny B. Goode's?

22:20.369 --> 22:22.167
In my parents'
living room?

22:22.202 --> 22:23.300
Yeah.
