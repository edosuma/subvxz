WEBVTT

00:04.205 --> 00:05.139
Shh.

00:05.173 --> 00:07.075
Don't wake her up.

00:07.108 --> 00:08.476
I'm trying to screw
as quietly as I can,

00:08.509 --> 00:11.512
but I'm having trouble
getting it in the hole.

00:11.545 --> 00:14.082
(chuckles)
Did you hear what I said?

00:14.115 --> 00:15.083
I said I'm
trying to get...

00:15.116 --> 00:16.016
Yeah, I heard
what you said.

00:16.050 --> 00:18.186
Shut up and screw faster,
so we can get this

00:18.219 --> 00:19.553
over with and go to sleep.

00:19.587 --> 00:21.522
(laughing): Did you hear
what you just said?

00:21.555 --> 00:24.258
(laughing): I did.
I said it on purpose.

00:24.292 --> 00:28.062
VIRGINIA:
Recently Burt and I
invested in a dead bolt

00:28.096 --> 00:30.098
Due to the fact
Maw Maw has been doing

00:30.131 --> 00:34.235
quite a bit of wandering
in the middle of the night.

00:34.268 --> 00:38.206
* Hey, Mambo!
Mambo Italiano! *

00:38.239 --> 00:39.607
* Oh, hey, Mambo!

00:39.640 --> 00:41.109
Maw Maw, get down from there.

00:41.142 --> 00:42.042
You're gonna break your neck!

00:42.076 --> 00:44.178
* Go, go, go, you
mixed-up Sicialiano *

00:44.212 --> 00:47.848
* All you calabraise do the
mambo like a crazy with a... *

00:47.881 --> 00:51.119
During the day we
can keep an eye on her,

00:51.152 --> 00:54.355
but at night, we have no idea
of knowing if she gets loose.

00:54.388 --> 00:56.224
(snoring)

00:56.257 --> 00:57.691
* Mambo Italiano!

00:57.725 --> 01:01.595
* Try an enchilada
with a fish baccala *

01:01.629 --> 01:02.863
Aah!

01:02.896 --> 01:06.300
* I love-a how
you dance a rhumbah *

01:06.334 --> 01:10.404
* But take some advise, paisano,
learn how to mambo *

01:10.438 --> 01:12.706
* If you gonna be a square,
you ain't-a gonna go nowhere *

01:12.740 --> 01:13.707
Hmm? (laughs)

01:13.741 --> 01:17.278
Hmm? (groans)

01:17.311 --> 01:20.381
She put makeup on me again while
I was sleeping, didn't she?

01:20.414 --> 01:24.252
* Go, go, Joe,
shake it like-a Giovanno *

01:24.285 --> 01:25.386
Where do you
think she got it?

01:25.419 --> 01:27.255
Who knows?

01:27.288 --> 01:28.889
Come on, Maw Maw.

01:28.922 --> 01:30.124
* Italiano!

01:30.158 --> 01:31.892
(clicks tongue)

01:31.925 --> 01:33.294
(horse whinnies)

01:35.329 --> 01:36.264
* That's nice-a

01:36.297 --> 01:37.265
* Boom! *

01:37.298 --> 01:38.432
There you go.

01:38.466 --> 01:42.303
Now, we should be able
to sleep in peace.

01:44.672 --> 01:46.807
(giggling)

01:46.840 --> 01:48.909
You didn't check to make
sure she was in there?

01:48.942 --> 01:50.444
Mmm...

01:50.478 --> 01:51.779
(yawns)
Hey.

01:54.315 --> 01:56.184
Aw, damn it,
Maw Maw!

01:56.217 --> 01:57.285
(record playing):
* Hey Mambo!

01:57.318 --> 01:58.286
Maw Maw, no!

01:58.319 --> 01:59.453
Off!

01:59.487 --> 02:01.755
* Hey, Mambo,
Mambo Italiano... *

02:01.789 --> 02:03.424
*

02:03.457 --> 02:04.658
* Whoo!

02:04.692 --> 02:09.497
* Here we go, oh, oh, oh,
oh, oh, oh! *

02:14.702 --> 02:16.537
(laughs)

02:16.570 --> 02:18.239
Nice shirt.

02:18.272 --> 02:20.374
Is that Versace?

02:20.408 --> 02:22.676
Oh, gag-tee dot com.

02:22.710 --> 02:24.512
They do good work, too.

02:24.545 --> 02:26.314
Hey, sweetie?

02:26.347 --> 02:27.881
Y-You're not gonna wear that
out tonight, are you?

02:27.915 --> 02:29.383
Yeah, why not?

02:29.417 --> 02:30.284
It's funny.

02:30.318 --> 02:31.652
And I-I've worn it before.

02:31.685 --> 02:32.453
FRANK: You know what
it means, right?

02:32.486 --> 02:35.356
The hand's pointing
down at his ...

02:35.389 --> 02:36.490
I-I do know
what it means, yeah.

02:36.524 --> 02:37.958
(both laughing)

02:37.991 --> 02:40.194
Listen, it was fine
when we were friends.

02:40.228 --> 02:42.296
You know, but now
that we're engaged, uh,

02:42.330 --> 02:44.898
it's just the things that you
do, they say something about me.

02:44.932 --> 02:46.367
And though that
shirt might say

02:46.400 --> 02:47.701
that your penis is stupid,

02:47.735 --> 02:50.504
it absolutely says
my vagina is an idiot.

02:50.538 --> 02:52.906
(no voice)

02:52.940 --> 02:55.876
It's my favorite shirt.

02:55.909 --> 02:58.479
Um, it's the only one I've ever
taken to a dry cleaners.

02:58.512 --> 03:00.214
So, I think I'm gonna wear it?

03:02.883 --> 03:04.685
Okay, fine.

03:06.520 --> 03:08.356
Nice.

03:08.389 --> 03:10.424
Don't let her change
who you are, man.

03:10.458 --> 03:12.226
Chicks always
try to do that.

03:12.260 --> 03:14.528
I've been video chatting
with this girl online

03:14.562 --> 03:16.297
and lately she's been like,

03:16.330 --> 03:19.933
"Take off your weird baby mask,
I want to see your face."

03:19.967 --> 03:22.703
I'm like, "Take off your
horse-head mask first."

03:22.736 --> 03:27.007
She wanted me to change but
she wasn't willing to change.

03:27.040 --> 03:28.376
Girls are crazy.

03:37.551 --> 03:39.620
Mm, another inch and a half.

03:39.653 --> 03:41.422
Every year, like clockwork.

03:41.455 --> 03:44.292
Dad, you're not growing
an inch and a half every year.

03:44.325 --> 03:45.293
Doorjamb don't lie.

03:45.326 --> 03:46.260
If that were true,

03:46.294 --> 03:48.796
you'd be seven foot,
14 inches tall by now.

03:48.829 --> 03:50.731
I think it might be time
to consider the possibility

03:50.764 --> 03:52.300
that your house is sinking.

03:54.935 --> 03:56.404
That's mine.

04:05.379 --> 04:07.348
(sighs)

04:07.981 --> 04:10.384
Oh, come on,
you both watched

04:10.418 --> 04:12.720
three cartoons
today about sharing.

04:12.753 --> 04:13.921
Did you learn nothing?

04:17.591 --> 04:19.327
Time to put on your jammies.

04:20.594 --> 04:22.930
(grunting)

04:25.766 --> 04:27.435
Maw Maw and Hope
are a lot alike.

04:27.468 --> 04:28.736
It's sweet.

04:28.769 --> 04:30.738
I hope I have a baby
rival when I'm her age.

04:30.771 --> 04:33.607
(doorbell rings)

04:37.345 --> 04:38.946
Is that a neighbor?
I don't recognize her.

04:38.979 --> 04:40.448
(doorbell rings)

04:40.481 --> 04:41.582
Should we see
what she wants?

04:41.615 --> 04:43.417
I say no.

04:43.451 --> 04:44.585
When is someone you
don't know ringing

04:44.618 --> 04:45.986
your doorbell
ever a good thing?

04:46.019 --> 04:48.456
What about that time that
overnight delivery guy

04:48.489 --> 04:50.658
accidentally delivered the
neighbor's package here.

04:50.691 --> 04:52.460
We might use that
medicine some day.

04:52.493 --> 04:54.462
What happened to that neighbor?

04:54.495 --> 04:55.629
I haven't seen him.

04:55.663 --> 04:56.830
(doorbell rings)

04:56.864 --> 04:59.367
Fine, but if it's bad,
you're gonna be

04:59.400 --> 05:01.034
the one to deal
with it, not me.

05:01.068 --> 05:02.536
I want to watch Wipeout.

05:02.570 --> 05:04.905
They're doing farmers
versus plumbers.

05:06.807 --> 05:09.477
Hello.
Is this the Chance residence?

05:09.510 --> 05:11.712
Why?

05:11.745 --> 05:14.348
Because I'm looking
for the Chance residence.

05:14.382 --> 05:16.350
Why?

05:16.384 --> 05:18.919
I can only tell you that if this
is the Chance residence.

05:25.493 --> 05:28.896
Yeah, it's the Chance residence.

05:28.929 --> 05:30.698
Great.

05:30.731 --> 05:33.501
Uh, my name is Joan Wrightsdale
and I'm from Social Services.

05:33.534 --> 05:36.404
I'm here to investigate
a complaint that we had

05:36.437 --> 05:39.507
about the welfare of a child
living in this residence.

05:39.540 --> 05:40.641
You didn't let me finish.

05:40.674 --> 05:41.809
It's the Chance residence...

05:41.842 --> 05:43.677
over there.

05:43.711 --> 05:45.579
Sorry I'm late, Chances.

05:45.613 --> 05:48.416
Up until about an hour ago,
totally thought it was Sunday.

05:50.117 --> 05:51.952
Okay, take care, Chances.

05:56.790 --> 05:59.059
Nine times out of ten,
guy doesn't say a word.

06:06.567 --> 06:08.569
So, a complaint
about the welfare of a child?

06:08.602 --> 06:09.937
I can't even imagine
what that would be.

06:09.970 --> 06:11.439
You know what?

06:11.472 --> 06:12.706
This is getting heavy.

06:12.740 --> 06:15.175
I'll go get us
some marshmallows.

06:15.208 --> 06:17.745
You know, it's probably nothing.

06:17.778 --> 06:19.413
We just have to follow up
on these things.

06:19.447 --> 06:20.280
Oh, sure, of course.

06:20.313 --> 06:22.450
But if it's just
one random complaint,

06:22.483 --> 06:23.551
how can you even trust it?

06:23.584 --> 06:24.885
Tell me about it.

06:24.918 --> 06:26.854
For example, I have

06:26.887 --> 06:28.889
a cat--
her name is Muffin.

06:28.922 --> 06:30.724
Oh, my.

06:30.758 --> 06:33.193
Thank you.

06:33.226 --> 06:36.497
Anyway, I am a great cat owner.

06:36.530 --> 06:37.765
But one time I was at the mall

06:37.798 --> 06:40.568
and Muffin just jumped out of my
arms and she landed on her head.

06:40.601 --> 06:42.636
And someone reported
me to the SPCA,

06:42.670 --> 06:44.805
and they said that I
dropped her, but I didn't.

06:44.838 --> 06:46.507
She jumped.

06:46.540 --> 06:48.442
Was she wearing that
outfit when she jumped?

06:48.476 --> 06:50.478
'Cause you could probably make
an argument that she was trying

06:50.511 --> 06:52.546
to commit suicide,
which isn't funny at all.

06:52.580 --> 06:54.081
Can I see that picture?
It's adorable.

06:56.684 --> 06:59.219
Hey... the government's
here to take the baby.

06:59.252 --> 07:01.054
They think we're
putting her in danger.

07:01.088 --> 07:02.456
Hurry, toss her over here.

07:02.490 --> 07:03.857
I'll hide her under the car.

07:04.525 --> 07:05.793
What's going on?

07:05.826 --> 07:07.895
Social Services got a complaint

07:07.928 --> 07:09.096
and now they're here
to check on Hope.

07:09.129 --> 07:10.931
Complaint?
Well, what was it?

07:10.964 --> 07:12.833
I'm guessing it's when you
couldn't find a towel.

07:14.768 --> 07:15.669
Turn around.

07:17.705 --> 07:19.640
I'm sure that wasn't it.

07:19.673 --> 07:21.675
If it's anything, it's that
stupid scooter-stroller

07:21.709 --> 07:22.710
that Dad invented.

07:28.281 --> 07:30.017
See you at the park, slowpoke!

07:31.284 --> 07:33.754
You're crazy.
People love that thing.

07:33.787 --> 07:36.256
They honk their horns and yell,
"Hey, Scooter-Stroller Guy!"

07:36.289 --> 07:38.091
I might just become
a small town novelty

07:38.125 --> 07:41.495
like Dancin' Dan or that guy
with the bunny ears who walks

07:41.529 --> 07:43.096
around at night carrying
that giant purple cross.

07:43.130 --> 07:44.498
What do they call him?

07:44.532 --> 07:46.600
Easter Joe.
Easter Joe!

07:46.634 --> 07:47.801
You don't think someone
complained about you, do you?

07:47.835 --> 07:49.837
You said you got
a lot of dirty looks

07:49.870 --> 07:50.470
at the grocery store last week.

07:50.504 --> 07:53.741
(Hope yelling, protesting)

07:56.677 --> 07:59.179
Once she stopped throwing a fit,
she was having a blast

07:59.212 --> 08:01.882
and now she loves being pulled
around by shopping carts.

08:01.915 --> 08:03.551
I had to stop her the other day

08:03.584 --> 08:04.818
from hitching a ride
with a homeless guy.

08:04.852 --> 08:07.187
Look, guys, you do a really
good job with Hope.

08:07.220 --> 08:08.889
I really don't think there's
anything to worry about.

08:08.922 --> 08:10.691
Well, we can't
be too careful.

08:10.724 --> 08:12.526
So, just make
everything look okay

08:12.560 --> 08:13.694
until the social
worker leaves.

08:13.727 --> 08:14.862
Clean up this room.

08:16.764 --> 08:19.700
Okay, but come on out when you
finish the book of Job.

08:19.733 --> 08:22.603
The Bible will still be
here when you get back.

08:22.636 --> 08:24.838
This may just be
an old lady talking,

08:24.872 --> 08:28.208
but your ugly kid looks
an awful lot like an ugly cat.

08:28.241 --> 08:29.710
Okay, Maw Maw,
let's go.

08:29.743 --> 08:30.744
You know you're supposed
to be in your room.

08:30.778 --> 08:33.046
Sorry about that.

08:33.080 --> 08:36.183
My son must forgot
to lock her door.

08:36.216 --> 08:38.752
She's a little batty,
but don't worry.

08:38.786 --> 08:40.554
We never leave her alone
with the child.

08:40.588 --> 08:43.023
Oh, that's probably a good idea.

08:43.056 --> 08:44.825
MAW MAW: Let me out!
Settle down!

08:44.858 --> 08:47.928
We have company.

08:47.961 --> 08:49.930
Seriously though,
wouldn't it be cool

08:49.963 --> 08:51.599
if I was a
small-town celebrity?

08:51.632 --> 08:53.066
People make fun
of Dancin' Dan and Easter Joe,

08:53.100 --> 08:54.835
but I know for a fact that
Chubby's Burgers gives them

08:54.868 --> 08:57.638
free food if they promise not
to urinate in the parking lot.

08:57.671 --> 08:59.607
I can promise not to do that.

08:59.640 --> 09:01.775
Wha-What is this?

09:01.809 --> 09:02.876
That's trash, toss it.

09:02.910 --> 09:04.712
Ho, ho, ho, nice try.

09:04.745 --> 09:06.647
Come on, it's time
to get rid of this stuff.

09:06.680 --> 09:08.682
I mean, even the social worker
would agree a three-year-old

09:08.716 --> 09:10.584
should not have
to be confused by

09:10.618 --> 09:12.119
what are her toys
and what are her daddy's toys.

09:12.920 --> 09:14.755
Well, fine.

09:14.788 --> 09:17.190
You can get rid of a few toys,
but the shirt stays.

09:17.224 --> 09:19.727
Fine, and while
we're throwing stuff out,

09:19.760 --> 09:22.796
I am done waking up
next to this every morning.

09:23.831 --> 09:25.933
Jennifer!
Maggie!

09:25.966 --> 09:28.802
(Maw Maw grunting)

09:28.836 --> 09:30.971
Here I go.

09:31.004 --> 09:31.772
(thud)

09:31.805 --> 09:32.773
(groans)

09:32.806 --> 09:35.976
We are out of marshmallows.

09:36.009 --> 09:38.746
But I did find a piece of taffy.

09:38.779 --> 09:40.380
Oh, I'm hypoglycemic.

09:40.413 --> 09:44.785
Oh, I have an aunt
who has cerebral palsy.

09:44.818 --> 09:47.821
Okay, I'm not sure
what those two things have

09:47.855 --> 09:48.989
to do with each other.

09:49.022 --> 09:50.924
Just someone I know
with a disease.

09:50.958 --> 09:53.393
Didn't want you to feel like you
were all alone out there.

09:53.426 --> 09:55.595
Oh, here's our little angel.

09:56.830 --> 09:58.899
That's a little girl.

09:58.932 --> 10:00.167
Where is the little boy?

10:01.168 --> 10:02.903
Excuse me?
The complaint is about

10:02.936 --> 10:04.304
a little boy, five years old.

10:04.337 --> 10:07.641
He was seen crowd-surfing
at a Smokey Floyd concert.

10:07.675 --> 10:08.475
Uh...

10:08.508 --> 10:11.111
That wasn't Hope,
that was Jimmy.

10:11.845 --> 10:13.847
(whooping)

10:21.689 --> 10:23.023
That happened 20 years ago.

10:23.056 --> 10:24.692
This is embarrassing.

10:24.725 --> 10:26.794
Um, we're a little behind
because of budget cuts.

10:26.827 --> 10:29.697
You know, last week,
I went to check on a child

10:29.730 --> 10:30.964
who was being
kept in a cage

10:30.998 --> 10:33.834
and I found
a teenager in a pen.

10:33.867 --> 10:35.002
(laughs)

10:35.035 --> 10:37.070
That better not be
the last piece of taffy.

10:38.038 --> 10:40.674
Maw Maw, no.
Aah!

10:40.708 --> 10:41.675
Room, room.

10:41.709 --> 10:42.676
Room, room, room.

10:42.710 --> 10:43.811
I'll go nail the window shut.

10:45.779 --> 10:46.646
I'm sorry about that.

10:46.680 --> 10:48.849
But, like I said,
we try to keep her away

10:48.882 --> 10:49.983
from the baby
as much as possible.

10:50.017 --> 10:51.284
I see that.

10:51.318 --> 10:53.053
We're gonna need
to change gears here.

10:53.086 --> 10:55.689
I'm beginning to be
a little bit concerned

10:55.723 --> 10:57.024
that you are abusing
your grandmother.

10:57.057 --> 10:58.759
Abusing her?

10:58.792 --> 11:00.193
(all scoff)

11:00.227 --> 11:01.962
She abuses us.

11:01.995 --> 11:04.031
She gave me a wet willy once

11:04.064 --> 11:05.398
that almost punctured
my eardrum.

11:05.432 --> 11:08.969
Her spit has touched my brain.

11:09.002 --> 11:10.871
I couldn't find any nails.

11:10.904 --> 11:12.840
But I broke a bottle on the
ground under the window,

11:12.873 --> 11:14.474
so that should deter her
from jumping out again.

11:14.507 --> 11:18.278
Okay. I'm gonna need
to ask her some questions.

11:19.947 --> 11:23.183
(sighs) You just had to answer
the door, didn't you?

11:23.216 --> 11:25.018
I could be knee-deep in watching
farmers and plumbers

11:25.052 --> 11:27.888
getting nailed in the face
with big red balls.

11:27.921 --> 11:29.790
Did you hear what you just said?

11:29.823 --> 11:30.958
Not in the mood, Burt.

11:35.395 --> 11:37.097
They shave me
when I'm sleeping.

11:37.130 --> 11:40.500
They made me live in
the greenhouse for a week.

11:40.533 --> 11:45.005
They wanted to go through
my poo to look for gold.

11:45.038 --> 11:46.740
She's making us
sound crazy.

11:46.774 --> 11:48.108
The lady needs to know

11:48.141 --> 11:50.377
that we love Maw Maw
unconventionally.

11:50.410 --> 11:51.945
I think you meant
"unconditionally,"

11:51.979 --> 11:53.914
though "unconventionally"
kinda works.

11:53.947 --> 11:55.115
You actually stumbled

11:55.148 --> 11:56.917
into saying something
kinda clever there.

11:56.950 --> 11:58.051
I did that once before.

11:58.085 --> 11:59.519
Burt, when did
I do that?

11:59.552 --> 12:01.521
When your uncle died,

12:01.554 --> 12:04.091
you said we had to go hear his
"last will and tentacle."

12:04.124 --> 12:06.794
Then he actually left
his pet octopus to your cousin.

12:06.827 --> 12:08.061
That's right.
That was crazy.

12:08.095 --> 12:09.897
Oh!

12:16.837 --> 12:18.405
Well, this is all
very disturbing.

12:18.438 --> 12:19.907
Look, before you go
judging us,

12:19.940 --> 12:20.941
you need to know...

12:20.974 --> 12:22.242
What do I need
to know what?

12:22.275 --> 12:23.877
That among other things,
she tells me

12:23.911 --> 12:26.113
you threaten to hit her
with a stick in order

12:26.146 --> 12:27.981
to get her to stop
playing the piano?

12:28.015 --> 12:29.282
Threaten, not hit.
Threaten to hit.

12:29.316 --> 12:31.819
She says you force her
to eat hot sauce.

12:31.852 --> 12:32.920
No, no, no.

12:32.953 --> 12:34.287
I put hot sauce on
my arms when it looks

12:34.321 --> 12:35.388
like she's in
a biting mood.

12:35.422 --> 12:36.790
If it ends up in
her mouth,

12:36.824 --> 12:38.225
that's the price she pays
for being nippy.

12:38.258 --> 12:40.260
You wrapped her in
plastic wrap to
try to subdue her!

12:40.293 --> 12:41.795
Let me get this straight.

12:41.829 --> 12:42.930
If you wrap somebody
in seaweed,

12:42.963 --> 12:44.064
it's a spa treatment,

12:44.097 --> 12:46.499
and you wrap somebody in
Saran wrap, and it's a crime.

12:46.533 --> 12:47.968
Obama!

12:48.001 --> 12:49.302
I have no other choice
but to start

12:49.336 --> 12:50.403
a formal investigation.

12:50.437 --> 12:52.139
What?
Just fill these out,

12:52.172 --> 12:53.841
complete the
required tasks,

12:53.874 --> 12:56.309
I'll be back
in one week for a
second inspection.

12:56.343 --> 12:58.278
If there is not a major
improvement in her treatment,

12:58.311 --> 13:00.513
we will be forced to put
her in a state-run home.

13:02.916 --> 13:04.317
Oh. Wherever it says "child,"

13:04.351 --> 13:05.953
could you just put
"old person"?

13:05.986 --> 13:06.820
Because I don't feel like
going back

13:06.854 --> 13:08.956
to the office
for those other forms.

13:10.023 --> 13:12.425
No, you can't do this.

13:12.459 --> 13:14.995
You have no idea what it's like
to deal with her

13:15.028 --> 13:17.430
on a daily basis!

13:17.464 --> 13:20.000
She's crazier
than a face-eating hobo!

13:20.033 --> 13:21.969
Hey! Can you keep it down?

13:22.002 --> 13:24.104
Some of us are trying
to land a plane in there.

13:24.137 --> 13:25.906
I know everyone is nervous,

13:25.939 --> 13:27.908
but hopefully, everyone will be
on the ground

13:27.941 --> 13:29.910
in Minneapolis within the hour.

13:29.943 --> 13:33.313
Please come back
and listen to this!

13:33.346 --> 13:35.482
VIRGINIA: If we didn't want
them to take Maw Maw away,

13:35.515 --> 13:36.816
we had our work cut out
for us.

13:36.850 --> 13:41.021
First, we needed to prove
we cared about her health.

13:41.054 --> 13:44.892
This isn't a Tom Jones concert.
It's a doctor's office!

13:44.925 --> 13:46.026
(Burt yelling)

13:46.059 --> 13:49.029
No, no, no,
no, no!

13:49.062 --> 13:50.297
Ah, that's deep!
That's really deep!

13:50.330 --> 13:51.631
She got me deep!

13:51.664 --> 13:54.968
Maw Maw, you need to see
the doctor for your check-up

13:55.002 --> 13:56.136
or they're gonna
take you away.

13:56.169 --> 13:59.006
Good.
I want to go on a vacation.

13:59.039 --> 14:00.040
I think she got a tendon.

14:00.073 --> 14:01.875
My pinky's
not working right.

14:01.909 --> 14:04.077
Trust me, you do not want to go
where they are taking you.

14:04.111 --> 14:05.245
Should I get the leash out
of the trunk?

14:05.278 --> 14:06.313
No, they said no leashes.

14:06.346 --> 14:09.917
"Number 87: no restraints
of any kind.

14:09.950 --> 14:12.519
"Do not strap the elderly
person in bed.

14:12.552 --> 14:14.487
"Do not--" and we assume
this goes without saying--

14:14.521 --> 14:16.990
"put the elderly person
on a leash."

14:17.024 --> 14:20.327
Ah... there's a lot
of stuff in here.

14:20.360 --> 14:22.095
You know, I heard
that old folks homes are

14:22.129 --> 14:23.263
actually really nice nowadays.

14:23.296 --> 14:25.899
Burt, she took care of me
my whole life.

14:25.933 --> 14:27.534
I'm not gonna let them
take her away.

14:27.567 --> 14:29.402
I owe it to her.

14:29.436 --> 14:32.039
We just got
to get her to cooperate.

14:32.072 --> 14:35.575
Maw Maw, if you don't go in
there, they're gonna...

14:35.608 --> 14:38.045
put you in the nuthouse

14:38.078 --> 14:40.047
and shock your brains
with electricity.

14:41.081 --> 14:42.916
(makes zapping sound)

14:43.616 --> 14:45.986
Fine. I'll see the doctor.

14:46.019 --> 14:49.256
But I just know he's gonna
tell me I'm pregnant.

14:49.289 --> 14:52.625
I'm 480 months late.

14:52.659 --> 14:56.396
VIRGINIA:
Once Maw Maw was on board,
things got a little easier.

14:56.429 --> 14:58.198
But not completely easy.

14:58.231 --> 15:04.137
Oh, uh, first of all,
I didn't ask you to get naked.

15:04.171 --> 15:06.039
Secondly, this is
the waiting room.

15:06.073 --> 15:08.976
Normally we have ways
of keeping her under control,

15:09.009 --> 15:12.112
but the state's kinda got
our hands tied at the moment.

15:12.145 --> 15:13.180
Luckily for us, we knew

15:13.213 --> 15:15.115
a certified elder-care
professional,

15:15.148 --> 15:17.217
and she agreed to give us
our eight hours

15:17.250 --> 15:18.285
of mandatory old person
training.

15:18.318 --> 15:19.586
Topics to avoid:

15:19.619 --> 15:21.154
(reading)

15:23.256 --> 15:24.191
Topics they enjoy:

15:29.329 --> 15:31.965
Excuse me.
This might be my mother.

15:33.766 --> 15:35.135
Hello?

15:35.168 --> 15:38.171
(over speaker):
Hello...?

15:40.107 --> 15:42.009
Hello?

15:42.042 --> 15:44.111
(over speaker):
Hello?

15:44.144 --> 15:46.013
Hello...?

15:46.046 --> 15:49.249
VIRGINIA:
According to the state,
we couldn't leave Maw Maw alone

15:49.282 --> 15:52.252
during the day, so I had
to take her to work with me.

15:52.285 --> 15:54.454
Maw Maw,
Liberace's gay!

15:56.189 --> 15:59.159
And since the lock wasn't
allowed, we had to figure out

15:59.192 --> 16:01.294
a new way to keep track
of Maw Maw at night.

16:01.328 --> 16:03.430
(bell dinging)

16:03.463 --> 16:06.299
Somehow we needed to convince
her to eat something healthier

16:06.333 --> 16:07.367
than pickles and taffy.

16:07.400 --> 16:09.136
Come on, Maw Maw.

16:09.169 --> 16:11.638
If you don't eat this, they're
gonna take you to a place

16:11.671 --> 16:14.207
where they stick a tube down
your throat and feed you

16:14.241 --> 16:15.308
with a bicycle pump.

16:19.212 --> 16:21.714
It wasn't easy,
(bell dinging)

16:21.748 --> 16:24.151
but we were doing
the best we could.

16:24.184 --> 16:27.320
(bell dinging)

16:27.354 --> 16:28.721
(sighs)

16:30.657 --> 16:32.225
(sighs) I got her.

16:39.732 --> 16:41.501
Hey, Easter Joe.

16:41.534 --> 16:44.071
Hey, Scooter-Stroller Guy.

16:48.541 --> 16:50.077
He's...

16:57.250 --> 16:59.219
What beautiful petunias,
Maw Maw.

16:59.252 --> 17:01.088
Oh, thank you.

17:01.121 --> 17:03.190
Joan! What?!

17:03.223 --> 17:05.325
I wasn't expecting you
until tomorrow.

17:05.358 --> 17:08.228
No, the visitation is today.

17:08.261 --> 17:10.230
That's why I called
this morning.

17:10.263 --> 17:13.400
VIRGINIA: Sorry, we just had
such a busy

17:13.433 --> 17:15.602
day of fun
senior activities.

17:15.635 --> 17:17.237
Come on in.

17:17.270 --> 17:18.105
Do you like pie?

17:18.138 --> 17:20.207
Maw Maw and I made
a banana cream pie

17:20.240 --> 17:21.541
with just a touch
of laxatives,

17:21.574 --> 17:23.243
so the trains run on time.

17:23.276 --> 17:26.079
The fox is in the henhouse.

17:26.113 --> 17:28.115
Whose socks are on
the pet mouse?

17:28.148 --> 17:29.149
(whispering):
They're coming in.

17:32.152 --> 17:33.620
Hey!

17:33.653 --> 17:35.222
Where'd you get
that shirt?

17:35.255 --> 17:37.124
In the Dumpster behind
the grocery store.

17:37.157 --> 17:39.359
I like it because it says,
"I'm whimsical,"

17:39.392 --> 17:41.261
but acknowledges that me
and my penis

17:41.294 --> 17:42.595
aren't always on
the same page.

17:42.629 --> 17:45.265
I can't believe
you threw it away.

17:45.298 --> 17:46.866
Dancin' Dan gets to wear
that shirt, but I don't?

17:46.899 --> 17:48.135
I mean, how is that fair?

17:48.168 --> 17:51.271
I don't know. Dancin' Dan will
not be sleeping with me tonight,

17:51.304 --> 17:53.140
will you, Dancin' Dan?

17:53.173 --> 17:54.874
I think your first
statement answered you
subsequent question,

17:54.907 --> 17:57.444
but if you insist on
rubbing it in, no.

17:57.477 --> 18:00.480
So, will we be spending
the evening together

18:00.513 --> 18:03.350
or are you with stupid?

18:07.787 --> 18:09.422
Enjoy the shirt, Dan.

18:11.424 --> 18:14.294
So, in addition
to the doctor visits,

18:14.327 --> 18:16.329
we've stocked the fridge
with all kinds of fruits

18:16.363 --> 18:19.199
and vegetables so Maw Maw can
have a balanced diet.

18:19.232 --> 18:22.302
And you see we have all
kinds of healthy juices:

18:22.335 --> 18:26.306
cran-apple, cran-grape,
cran-banana.

18:26.339 --> 18:28.741
If a cranberry has had sex
with it, we've got it.

18:28.775 --> 18:30.310
Very good.

18:30.343 --> 18:34.214
I'm a big cran fan myself.

18:34.247 --> 18:36.149
There is no longer a lock
on her door,

18:36.183 --> 18:38.318
no glass outside her window,

18:38.351 --> 18:40.853
and she's no longer shackled
to the radiator.

18:40.887 --> 18:42.422
You didn't know
about that, did you?

18:42.455 --> 18:43.856
Never happened.

18:43.890 --> 18:46.293
The point is, she's free
to come and go

18:46.326 --> 18:47.427
as she wishes, as you will see.

18:47.460 --> 18:50.763
And lastly,
because she likes
to just sit in her room

18:50.797 --> 18:53.333
and read-- that is,
when we aren't taking turns

18:53.366 --> 18:55.435
giving her hugs--
one of the hardest
things for us

18:55.468 --> 18:58.171
to figure out was how
to get her to exercise more.

19:04.744 --> 19:06.179
A motion detector on
the light--

19:06.213 --> 19:07.780
that's very clever.

19:07.814 --> 19:10.217
Thanks!

19:10.250 --> 19:11.451
Someone else
invented the sensor.

19:11.484 --> 19:14.487
We-We just installed it.
Yeah.

19:14.521 --> 19:17.690
It's a lot spookier when you go
out to the garage now,

19:17.724 --> 19:20.493
but Maw Maw's worth it.
Mm-hmm.

19:20.527 --> 19:21.728
I've gotta hand it to you.

19:21.761 --> 19:23.830
You've really turned
things around.

19:23.863 --> 19:26.899
Well, it wasn't easy, but
we just love her so much,

19:26.933 --> 19:29.202
we can't imagine not
having her here with us.

19:29.236 --> 19:31.671
Plus, I don't want you
to shock my brain.

19:31.704 --> 19:32.539
Excuse me?

19:32.572 --> 19:34.274
(makes zapping sound)

19:34.307 --> 19:35.074
Okay.

19:35.107 --> 19:36.543
She didn't understand
what we meant

19:36.576 --> 19:38.645
when we said the state would
take her away, so...

19:38.678 --> 19:39.646
(zapping)

19:39.679 --> 19:42.415
To get her to cooperate,
we just kinda had to...

19:42.449 --> 19:45.352
imblemish the truth a little.

19:45.385 --> 19:47.520
Really?
They told me about you.

19:47.554 --> 19:51.491
They said you were gonna
dip my feet in custard

19:51.524 --> 19:53.526
and feed 'em to wild hogs.

19:54.394 --> 19:56.496
We had to tell her that

19:56.529 --> 19:59.432
so she would put her shoes back
on at Salad Plantation.

19:59.466 --> 20:01.368
(chuckles, mutters)

20:01.401 --> 20:02.835
You're an evil woman.

20:02.869 --> 20:04.504
No, I'm not.
I'm really not.

20:04.537 --> 20:07.374
I care a great deal
about you, Barbara June.

20:07.407 --> 20:10.243
Then why do you want me
to run in a giant hamster wheel

20:10.277 --> 20:11.744
to power your
model train set?

20:11.778 --> 20:14.914
No one is going to do
anything bad to you.

20:14.947 --> 20:17.550
These people have been lying.
So I'd like you

20:17.584 --> 20:19.452
to go ahead
and pack a bag.

20:19.486 --> 20:21.421
and I'm gonna take you
somewhere

20:21.454 --> 20:23.556
where you're going
to be much happier.

20:23.590 --> 20:27.327
Oh, goody! Oh, I'm going
on a trip! Whoo!

20:27.360 --> 20:28.761
You can't do that!

20:28.795 --> 20:30.397
We did what you told us to!

20:30.430 --> 20:31.431
And in doing so,

20:31.464 --> 20:32.965
you replaced physical abuse
with mental abuse.

20:32.999 --> 20:35.368
Mental abuse?
Is that even a thing?

20:35.402 --> 20:36.969
First of all,
you're the only one

20:37.003 --> 20:38.805
who ever said we were
physically abusing her,

20:38.838 --> 20:40.640
and we're just doing what
we need to do

20:40.673 --> 20:43.643
to get her to do the things
on your stupid list!

20:43.676 --> 20:45.412
You bureaucratic
cat-dropper!

20:45.445 --> 20:46.646
I wish I knew more
about you

20:46.679 --> 20:48.581
so I could come up
with a better insult!

20:48.615 --> 20:50.750
Actually, that one
cut right to the bone!

21:01.661 --> 21:03.596
I can't believe they took her.

21:07.500 --> 21:10.036
Tune in next week
for more skin...

21:12.705 --> 21:13.940
...more action...

21:13.973 --> 21:14.941
(gasping)

21:17.377 --> 21:20.313
...and more PG-13 violence.

21:20.647 --> 21:22.315
(gun cocks)

21:22.349 --> 21:24.484
And tell your friends
to watch, too.

21:24.517 --> 21:24.584
A lot of people worked
really hard on this thing.
