TROUPER, MAN,

07:16.394 --> 07:19.355
{\an8}FOR TRYING TO GO TO WORK
AFTER THIS SHIT.

07:19.438 --> 07:21.149
{\an8}SERIOUS TROUPER.

07:21.232 --> 07:22.817
{\an8}- LET'S GO, GUYS.

07:22.900 --> 07:25.403
{\an8}OFF TO WORK.

07:28.322 --> 07:29.448
{\an8}- YOU HOLDING HIS
ASS-PIRIN?

07:29.532 --> 07:32.034
{\an8}- [groans]
- [giggles]

07:32.285 --> 07:33.744
{\an8}- I HAVE A HIGH THRESHOLD
FOR PAIN.

07:33.828 --> 07:34.954
{\an8}- [giggles]

07:35.246 --> 07:36.497
{\an8}- LUCKILY I HAVE
NO FAT ON MY BODY,

07:36.581 --> 07:37.540
{\an8}AND I WAS ABLE TO...

07:37.623 --> 07:39.876
{\an8}[laughter]

07:39.959 --> 07:41.085
{\an8}- WHAT'S UP, GUYS?

07:41.377 --> 07:42.670
{\an8}- HEY, WHAT'S UP?

07:51.012 --> 07:52.138
{\an8}- MIKE!

07:52.388 --> 07:53.431
{\an8}C'MON.

07:53.514 --> 07:55.641
{\an8}STEVE, VINNY,
WORK MIDDLE, MAN.

07:55.933 --> 07:57.143
{\an8}HELP HER OUT.
- ALL RIGHT, FINE.

07:57.226 --> 07:59.770
{\an8}I'M WORKING MIDDLE.

08:00.062 --> 08:02.523
{\an8}- LOOKING AT HIMSELF
IN THE MIRROR.

08:02.607 --> 08:03.816
{\an8}- I'M JUST TRYING
TO MAKE SURE

08:04.066 --> 08:05.610
{\an8}MY APPEARANCE IS GOOD
FOR MY BOSS.

08:05.693 --> 08:06.527
{\an8}YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?
- YOUR APPEARANCE LOOKS GREAT.

08:06.611 --> 08:07.820
{\an8}LET'S GET OUT THERE.

08:08.112 --> 08:09.655
{\an8}- OKAY.
- AND TALK TO THE CUSTOMERS.

08:09.739 --> 08:10.823
{\an8}- HOW ARE YOU?
HOW YOU GUYS DOING?

08:11.115 --> 08:13.242
{\an8}- HE WALKED RIGHT BY THEM.

08:13.326 --> 08:14.827
{\an8}YOU'RE WALKING
RIGHT BY THEM, MIKE!

08:14.911 --> 08:15.870
{\an8}THEY'RE EVERYWHERE!

08:16.120 --> 08:18.080
{\an8}- I SAID HELLO.
HI.

08:18.372 --> 08:20.708
{\an8}- MIKE IS THE KING
ABOUT NOT WORKING.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.586
{\an8}SO DANNY
IS BUSTING HIS BALLS.

08:23.878 --> 08:25.171
{\an8}- OH, NO, I STILL
GO TO THE CLUBS.

08:25.463 --> 08:26.881
{\an8}I-I MEAN, I HAVE FUN
AT THE CLUBS.

08:26.964 --> 08:28.424
{\an8}I JUST AM--
I JUST DON'T DRINK RIGHT NOW.

08:28.507 --> 08:29.800
{\an8}- SERIOUSLY, GUYS?

08:30.051 --> 08:31.177
{\an8}C'MON.
- HE ASKED ME--

08:31.260 --> 08:32.303
{\an8}- I'M WORKING.
- HE ASKED ME SOMETHING.

08:32.385 --> 08:33.929
{\an8}- YEAH, I KNOW, YOU'RE WORKING.

08:34.013 --> 08:35.514
{\an8}YOU'RE STARING
INTO EACH OTHER'S EYES.

08:35.597 --> 08:36.890
{\an8}IT'S 'CAUSE YOU GUYS BOTH
GOT TIGHT SHIRTS ON, C'MON.

08:37.225 --> 08:39.602
{\an8}- DANNY IS DEFINITELY
ON MIKE'S ASS TODAY.

08:39.684 --> 08:41.145
{\an8}AND I'M HONESTLY
A LITTLE BIT WORRIED,

08:41.229 --> 08:44.565
{\an8}BECAUSE HE DOES HAVE A REASON
WHY HE'S SLACKING OFF.

08:44.649 --> 08:46.234
{\an8}BECAUSE HE IS IN PAIN,
I CAN SEE IT.

08:46.317 --> 08:48.152
{\an8}THE KID JUST FUCKING
GOT OUT OF REHAB.

08:48.236 --> 08:50.655
{\an8}- COME ON, DUDE.
DON'T BE THAT OLD MIKE.

08:57.161 --> 08:57.954
{\an8}- PEOPLE?

08:58.204 --> 08:58.913
{\an8}- YEAH?

08:59.205 --> 09:01.540
{\an8}- COME HERE.

09:01.624 --> 09:04.043
{\an8}- WHEN'S HE COMING?

09:04.377 --> 09:06.671
{\an8}- HE SHOULD BE HERE
BY, LIKE, 7:00, 7:15.

09:06.754 --> 09:08.256
{\an8}- I THINK DEENA
AND CHRIS'S RELATIONSHIP

09:08.339 --> 09:09.757
{\an8}IS AWESOME.

09:09.840 --> 09:11.968
{\an8}YOU KNOW, DEENA
FOUND A PERFECT GUY.

09:12.301 --> 09:14.303
{\an8}AND I THINK CHRIS
IS A GREAT GUY FOR HER.

09:14.387 --> 09:17.848
{\an8}AND, UM, I'M JUST HAPPY
THAT DEENA'S HAPPY.

09:17.932 --> 09:19.183
{\an8}- YOU KNOW WHAT'S COOL?

09:19.267 --> 09:21.519
{\an8}LIKE, THIS EXPERIENCE
MAKES ME FEEL LIKE--

09:21.602 --> 09:22.979
{\an8}IT'S, LIKE,

09:23.312 --> 09:24.814
{\an8}THE BEGINNING
OF OUR RELATIONSHIP AGAIN.

09:24.897 --> 09:25.856
{\an8}LIKE, YOU KNOW, LIKE,
I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM IN SO LONG,

09:26.107 --> 09:27.400
{\an8}AND I'M LIKE--
[panting]

09:27.483 --> 09:28.985
{\an8}- YEAH, THAT'S HOW
I FEEL TOO.

09:29.068 --> 09:32.029
{\an8}ALL THE TIME.

09:32.113 --> 09:34.115
{\an8}HOW DO YOU DO YOUR MAKEUP
WITHOUT LOOKING AT ANYTHING?

09:34.407 --> 09:35.658
{\an8}- I DON'T KNOW.

09:35.950 --> 09:37.368
{\an8}I HAVE A MIRROR
RIGHT HERE.

09:37.451 --> 09:38.619
{\an8}I DON'T REALLY LOOK.

09:38.911 --> 09:40.288
{\an8}- LET ME SEE YOUR OUTFIT.
STAND UP.

09:40.371 --> 09:41.747
{\an8}- OH.
I CHANGED THE SHOES,

09:41.831 --> 09:43.040
{\an8}'CAUSE RIGHT NOW
MY FEET ARE HURTING,

09:43.332 --> 09:44.792
{\an8}AND THESE JUST--
- YOU LOOK SO GOOD.

09:44.875 --> 09:46.168
{\an8}- YEAH?
- DEENA LOOKS AWESOME.

09:46.502 --> 09:49.005
{\an8}LIKE, I FEEL LIKE
A FAT MEATBALL WHALE.

09:49.297 --> 09:52.049
{\an8}AND THEN HERE'S, YOU KNOW,
SKINNY DEENA.

09:52.341 --> 09:53.759
{\an8}I'M LIKE,
"YOU WOULD, YOU WHORE."

09:54.010 --> 09:55.219
{\an8}SEXY.

09:55.511 --> 09:56.887
{\an8}YOU LOOK
REALLY SKINNY TOO.

09:56.971 --> 09:58.306
{\an8}- THANK YOU.

09:58.389 --> 09:59.515
{\an8}I'M EXCITED.

10:02.435 --> 10:03.978
{\an8}- MY BUTT IS HURTING.
- OKAY.

10:04.061 --> 10:07.773
{\an8}- 'SCUSE ME.

10:08.065 --> 10:09.150
{\an8}- MIKE! WHY ARE YOU
SITTING DOWN?

10:09.442 --> 10:11.068
{\an8}- WHAT THE FU--

10:11.319 --> 10:12.820
{\an8}- WHAT'D I JUST ASK YOU?

10:12.903 --> 10:14.447
{\an8}I WAS LIKE, "WHILE I'M GONE,
COULD YOU HELP OUT, MAN?"

10:14.530 --> 10:17.199
{\an8}- I WAS ON THE FLOOR
95% OF THE TIME,

10:17.491 --> 10:19.410
{\an8}AND THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN,
LIKE, 30 SECONDS

10:19.493 --> 10:20.828
{\an8}THAT I STEPPED ON THIS...
- LOOKS GOOD, MAN.

10:20.911 --> 10:21.996
{\an8}- ON THIS PLATFORM RIGHT HERE.

10:22.288 --> 10:23.706
{\an8}'CAUSE MY BUTT WAS HURTING.

10:23.789 --> 10:25.082
{\an8}- I'M JUST SEEING THE OLD MIKE,
NOT THE NEW MIKE.

10:25.166 --> 10:26.667
{\an8}AND THAT HURTS.

10:26.751 --> 10:28.377
{\an8}- NO, I JUST GOT A--
A SHOT FROM THE DOCTOR,

10:28.461 --> 10:30.004
{\an8}AND IT'S EXTREMELY PAINFUL.

10:30.087 --> 10:31.380
{\an8}THE FIRST TIME
I GOT THE SHOT, I WAS--

10:31.464 --> 10:33.132
{\an8}I--YOU KNOW,
YOU--

10:33.466 --> 10:35.051
{\an8}I SLEPT ALL DAY,
[stammers]'CAUSE IT HURTS.

10:35.134 --> 10:37.636
{\an8}JUST INFORMING YOU
THAT I'M NOT HALF-ASSING IT,

10:37.720 --> 10:38.971
{\an8}IF YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING.

10:39.263 --> 10:40.348
{\an8}[laughter]

10:40.431 --> 10:42.058
{\an8}IT'S THE FIRST DAY
OF WORK TODAY.

10:42.141 --> 10:45.144
{\an8}IT'S A NEW SUMMER,
IT'S A NEW, YOU KNOW, YEAR.

10:45.394 --> 10:46.562
{\an8}AND I DIDN'T WANNA
START IT OFF

10:46.645 --> 10:48.147
{\an8}BY CALLING OUT OF WORK
THE FIRST DAY.

10:48.439 --> 10:50.733
{\an8}SO I REALLY TRIED TO MAN UP
ON ALL TYPE OF LEVELS.

10:50.816 --> 10:52.818
{\an8}BUT IT'S--
LOOKS LIKE IT MAY BACKFIRE.

10:52.902 --> 10:54.278
{\an8}- DANNY, YOU NEED A DRINK.

10:54.570 --> 10:55.738
{\an8}YOU NEED SOME ALCOHOL,

10:55.821 --> 10:57.198
{\an8}YOU NEED TO LOOSEN UP
A LITTLE BIT.

10:57.531 --> 10:58.866
{\an8}- WELL, I'M REAL NERVOUS.
I GOT EVERYONE SLACKING.

10:58.949 --> 11:00.701
{\an8}- EVERYBODY LOOKS LIKE
THEY GOT A SHOT TODAY.

11:00.785 --> 11:02.370
{\an8}- I KNOW, EXACTLY.
[laughter]

11:02.453 --> 11:03.662
{\an8}MIKE'S THE ONLY ONE WHO
REALLY HAS SOME PAIN,

11:03.746 --> 11:05.164
{\an8}AND YOU GUYS...

11:05.456 --> 11:05.956
{\an8}- BUT, LOOK, HE'S MILKING IT
MORE AND MORE NOW.

11:06.248 --> 11:07.124
{\an8}YOU NEED A CANE?

11:07.416 --> 11:08.626
{\an8}WE GOTTA GET HIM SOME CRUTCHES.

11:08.709 --> 11:10.169
{\an8}- AW, MAN, I--
[chuckles]

11:10.503 --> 11:13.172
{\an8}I'M TIRED
OF THE JOKES, MAN. [chuckles]

11:15.424 --> 11:18.803
{\an8}- WHAT JUST HAPPENED?

11:18.886 --> 11:20.304
{\an8}- DID YOU CHANGE
YOUR FACEBOOK STATUS?

11:20.596 --> 11:21.347
{\an8}- LOOK AT HIS FACE.

11:21.639 --> 11:23.849
{\an8}- I'M ASKING YOU.

11:23.933 --> 11:25.476
{\an8}- MY STOMACH HURTS.

11:25.559 --> 11:26.894
{\an8}- D IS GETTING SICK.

11:26.977 --> 11:28.229
{\an8}I HOPE SHE'S NOT
FUCKING PREGNANT.

11:28.521 --> 11:29.313
{\an8}- [vomiting]

11:38.614 --> 11:40.449
{\an8}- THAT'S NOT GOOD
FOR HIM, THOUGH.

11:40.533 --> 11:42.993
{\an8}- YEAH, IT'S NOT GOOD
TO SEE HIM FREAK OUT LIKE THAT.

11:43.077 --> 11:44.703
{\an8}WE'RE ALL ADULTS HERE.

11:55.047 --> 11:57.967
{\an8}- I'LL GO CHECK ON HIM.
I DON'T KNOW WHERE HE WENT.

11:58.259 --> 12:00.469
{\an8}- VIN.
GIVE HIM THE SPEECH, VIN.

12:00.553 --> 12:01.971
{\an8}- WAIT, WHAT? THERE'S A SPEECH?
[chuckles]

12:02.054 --> 12:03.764
{\an8}- YEAH, LIKE,
VIN HELPS EVERYBODY.

12:03.848 --> 12:05.057
{\an8}YOU KNOW THIS.

12:05.349 --> 12:08.060
{\an8}- YEAH, I KNOW.
BUT THIS...COME ON.

12:08.394 --> 12:10.479
{\an8}- I'M HONESTLY
A LITTLE BIT WORRIED,

12:10.563 --> 12:11.939
{\an8}BECAUSE ONCE YOU START
TO GET ANGRY,

12:12.231 --> 12:13.524
{\an8}THAT'S WHEN THE EGO
COMES OUT.

12:13.607 --> 12:15.651
{\an8}AND THAT'S THE SHIT
THAT BRINGS YOU DOWNHILL.

12:15.734 --> 12:19.196
{\an8}AND FOR SOMEONE
WITH A RECENT DRUG PROBLEM,

12:19.447 --> 12:20.739
{\an8}THAT'S NOT
A GOOD THING.

12:20.823 --> 12:23.492
{\an8}YOU ALL RIGHT, BRO?
- YOU GUYS QUIT WORK?

12:23.576 --> 12:25.119
{\an8}- NAH, I JUST DIDN'T THINK
IT WAS RIGHT

12:25.202 --> 12:26.871
{\an8}THAT THEY KEPT
GOING ON AND ON ABOUT IT.

12:27.246 --> 12:28.831
{\an8}I MEAN, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
LIKE, I-I MEAN, UH--

12:28.914 --> 12:30.249
{\an8}- YEAH, BUT YOU CAN'T--
DON'T BE GETTING MAD LIKE THAT.

12:30.583 --> 12:32.668
{\an8}YOU KNOW, FUCKING
DRIVE YOURSELF CRAZY.

12:32.751 --> 12:35.212
{\an8}- I-I HAVE PATIENCE,
YOU UNDERSTAND?

12:35.504 --> 12:37.173
{\an8}BUT, LIKE--
- I AGREE WITH YOU, 100%.

12:37.256 --> 12:39.049
{\an8}- YOU KNOW, YOU DON'T--YOU DON'T
KEEP GOING ON ABOUT IT.

12:39.133 --> 12:40.468
{\an8}YOU DON'T DO THAT.

12:40.551 --> 12:42.344
{\an8}IT'S JUST LIKE SOMEBODY'S LIFE,
YOU KNOW?

12:42.636 --> 12:43.888
{\an8}- I AGREE, 100%.

12:43.971 --> 12:44.889
{\an8}IF YOU CAN'T DO IT,
JUST CHILL.

12:44.972 --> 12:46.307
{\an8}DON'T WORK YOURSELF UP.

12:46.640 --> 12:47.266
{\an8}ANYTIME YOU FEEL LIKE
YOU'RE GETTING STRESSED,

12:47.600 --> 12:48.976
{\an8}IT'S NOT WORTH IT.

12:49.226 --> 12:50.144
{\an8}FOR THE SHORE STORE.

12:50.436 --> 12:51.770
{\an8}[laughter]

12:51.854 --> 12:53.272
{\an8}THERE'S OTHER T-SHIRT STORES
OUT THERE, BRO.

12:53.564 --> 12:54.732
{\an8}OKAY? WE'LL GET YOU A JOB.

12:54.815 --> 12:55.941
{\an8}- YEAH, THERE'S A LOT
OF SHORE STORES.

12:56.233 --> 12:57.443
{\an8}- WE'LL GET YOU JOB
AT BABY GAP.

12:57.693 --> 12:58.569
{\an8}- BABY G, MAN, BABY G.
- [chuckles]

12:58.652 --> 13:00.237
{\an8}YOU--YOU GOOD?
- YEAH.

13:00.654 --> 13:01.739
{\an8}- [stammers] I DON'T WANNA SEE
YOU GET MAD LIKE THAT, YOU KNOW?

13:01.822 --> 13:03.407
{\an8}THAT'S HOW YOU...

13:03.699 --> 13:05.034
{\an8}START THINKING.

13:05.117 --> 13:06.285
{\an8}ALL RIGHT, I'LL TELL HIM
YOU'RE JUST NOT

13:06.619 --> 13:08.329
{\an8}FEELING GOOD AND SHIT.

13:14.710 --> 13:15.920
{\an8}- SO I'M ABOUT TO GO
ON A DATE WITH CHRIS,

13:16.003 --> 13:18.172
{\an8}AND I'M REALLY EXCITED.

13:18.255 --> 13:20.216
{\an8}IN A WAY, THE DISTANCE
IS MAKING ME FEEL LIKE

13:20.508 --> 13:22.510
{\an8}IT'S, LIKE,
THE BEGINNING AGAIN.

13:22.593 --> 13:24.136

22:03.864 --> 22:05.532
{\an8}- DO I HAVE TO EAT?

22:05.615 --> 22:06.992
{\an8}'CAUSE WHAT IF EVERYBODY GOES
TO, LIKE, CAPTAIN HOOKS, OR--

22:07.284 --> 22:08.577
{\an8}- SO WHAT DO YOU MEAN
ABOUT CAPTAIN HOOKS?

22:08.827 --> 22:10.203
{\an8}IT'S JUST CAPTAIN HOOKS.

22:10.287 --> 22:11.580
{\an8}IT'S NOT KARMA.
- [chuckles]

22:11.830 --> 22:12.789
{\an8}- ALL RIGHT, GUYS.

22:13.040 --> 22:14.041
{\an8}RONNIE.

22:14.124 --> 22:15.542
{\an8}GOOD TO HAVE YOU BACK.

22:15.625 --> 22:19.046
{\an8}- I'LL SEE YA.

22:19.129 --> 22:20.338
{\an8}- ARE YOU GONNA
LAY DOWN?

22:20.422 --> 22:22.716
{\an8}- YEAH, I DON'T FEEL
GOOD.

22:25.177 --> 22:27.679
{\an8}I KEEP GETTING SHOOTING PAINS
IN MY STOMACH.

22:27.763 --> 22:29.097
{\an8}- WHAT DID YOU EAT?

22:29.181 --> 22:31.058
{\an8}- I DIDN'T EVEN EAT
THAT SALAD.

22:31.141 --> 22:33.727
{\an8}YOU DON'T THINK I COULD HAVE
TOXIC SHOCK SYNDROME?

22:34.061 --> 22:36.063
{\an8}RIGHT NOW, I FEEL LIKE MY BODY
IS GOING INTO SHOCK.

22:36.146 --> 22:37.522
{\an8}LIKE, EVERYTHING HURTS,

22:37.814 --> 22:38.940
{\an8}I FEEL LIKE
I HAVE A FEVER,

22:39.232 --> 22:40.567
{\an8}I FEEL LIKE
I HAVE TO THROW UP.

22:40.650 --> 22:42.611
{\an8}I FEEL LIKE I MIGHT HAVE
"TOXER SHOCK SHINDROME."

22:42.944 --> 22:45.530
{\an8}- TSS? YOU LEAVE
A TAMPON IN FOR TOO LONG?

22:45.614 --> 22:47.824
{\an8}- YEAH.
- HOW LONG?

22:48.158 --> 22:49.117
{\an8}IT'S GOTTA BE OVER A DAY.

22:49.201 --> 22:51.036
{\an8}- ALL DAY,
AND THEN TODAY.

22:51.328 --> 22:52.120
{\an8}- LIKE,
ALL DAY YESTERDAY?

22:52.204 --> 22:53.413
{\an8}- MM-HMM.

22:53.497 --> 22:54.581
{\an8}- AND ALL DAY TODAY?

22:54.664 --> 22:57.375
{\an8}- AFTER WORK, I PUT IT BACK IN.

22:57.459 --> 22:59.461
{\an8}- OH, UGH.

22:59.544 --> 23:01.379
{\an8}MY TEACHER PASSED AWAY
FROM THAT.

23:01.671 --> 23:02.881
{\an8}- REALLY?
- YEAH.

23:03.173 --> 23:05.926
{\an8}MY, LIKE,
SEVENTH-GRADE TEACHER.

23:06.218 --> 23:06.968
{\an8}- WHAT HAPPENS?

23:07.052 --> 23:09.638
{\an8}I DON'T EVEN KNOW THE SYMPTOMS.

23:09.721 --> 23:12.557
{\an8}- READ YOUR TAMPON BOX.

23:12.641 --> 23:15.477
{\an8}IT'S IN--IT'S IN A PAMPHLET
INSIDE OF IT.

23:15.852 --> 23:17.729
{\an8}ANYONE IN THE HOUSE THAT'S MORE
OF A HYPOCHONDRIAC

23:18.021 --> 23:19.815
{\an8}AND MORE DRAMATIC THAN ME,
IT'S DEENA.

23:20.107 --> 23:21.566
{\an8}SO SHE SAYS TSS,

23:21.650 --> 23:23.777
{\an8}TOXIC SHOCK SYNDROME
THAT YOU GET FROM TAMPONS,

23:24.027 --> 23:25.445
{\an8}WEARING 'EM TOO LONG.

23:25.529 --> 23:27.531
{\an8}SHE SAYS SHE WORE IT
FOR, LIKE, 18 HOURS.

23:27.614 --> 23:29.032
{\an8}EVERY GIRL'S BEEN THERE.

23:29.324 --> 23:31.743
{\an8}IT TAKES WEEKS UPON WEEKS
TO CATCH THAT SHIT.

23:32.077 --> 23:33.578
{\an8}- OH, MY GOSH, IT SAYS
"VOMITING AND DIARRHEA."

23:33.829 --> 23:35.831
{\an8}I VOMITED TODAY.

23:36.123 --> 23:38.667
{\an8}DO I FEEL LIKE
I HAVE A FEVER?

23:38.750 --> 23:39.960
{\an8}IT SAYS LIKE,
YOU COULD HAVE A RASH

23:40.252 --> 23:41.294
{\an8}THAT LOOKS LIKE
YOU'RE SUNBURNED.

23:41.378 --> 23:42.420
{\an8}AND I'M LIKE,
I'M ALREADY TAN.

23:42.504 --> 23:43.964
{\an8}I JUST WENT TANNING.

23:44.256 --> 23:47.092
{\an8}IS THIS "TOXIC SOCK SHINDRONE,"
OR AM I JUST TAN?

23:47.175 --> 23:49.094
{\an8}- DO YOU WANT ME
TO CALL A DOCTOR?

23:49.386 --> 23:51.513
{\an8}- WELL, I GUESS,
IF IT GETS WORSE.

23:51.805 --> 23:53.265
{\an8}I'M THROUGH WITH THAT.
- WELL...

23:53.348 --> 23:56.393
{\an8}RELAX FOR, LIKE, 45 MINUTES
AND SEE IF IT'LL GO AWAY.

23:56.476 --> 23:58.270
{\an8}- I HOPE I DON'T DIE.

23:58.353 --> 24:00.438
{\an8}- YOU'RE NOT GONNA DIE.
I MEAN, I WON'T LET YOU.

24:00.522 --> 24:02.649
{\an8}- I'M REALLY WORRIED,
AND JENNI'S LIKE, "YOU'RE FINE."

24:02.732 --> 24:05.527
{\an8}LIKE, RIGHT NOW, SHE'S NOT
DOING VERY GOOD NURSING.

24:05.819 --> 24:08.446
{\an8}- MAYBE IT'S JUST
HORRIBLE GAS.

24:08.530 --> 24:09.573
{\an8}- YEAH, MAN!

24:09.656 --> 24:11.199
{\an8}- I SING THE FIRST SONG.

24:11.283 --> 24:12.284
{\an8}[vocalizes in a silly way]

24:12.367 --> 24:13.660
{\an8}- WHAT THE HELL?

24:13.994 --> 24:15.203
{\an8}- AND, ALL OF A SUDDEN,
WE'RE ALL SINGERS.

24:15.287 --> 24:17.956
{\an8}- ♪ THEY TRIED
TO MAKE ME GO TO REHAB ♪

24:18.290 --> 24:20.500
{\an8}♪ I SAID, NO, NO, NO ♪

24:20.584 --> 24:22.377
{\an8}- TOO SOON, TOO SOON.

24:22.460 --> 24:25.714
{\an8}- I DON'T KNOW, MOM.

24:25.797 --> 24:27.174
{\an8}- DEENA HAD A MELTDOWN.

24:27.257 --> 24:28.508
{\an8}- I'M NOT LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE.
I'M NOT NORMAL.

24:36.766 --> 24:38.643
{\an8}[line rings]

24:38.894 --> 24:40.729
{\an8}- HELLO?

24:40.812 --> 24:42.147
{\an8}- HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

24:42.439 --> 24:43.773
{\an8}- AW, NOTHING MUCH,
JUST STARTING DINNER.

24:44.024 --> 24:45.567
{\an8}WHAT ARE YOU UP TO?

24:45.650 --> 24:47.444
{\an8}- NOTHING.
I DON'T REALLY FEEL GOOD.

24:47.527 --> 24:48.737
{\an8}- WHY?
WHAT'S WRONG?

24:49.070 --> 24:50.572
{\an8}- I DON'T KNOW,
MY ENTIRE BODY HURTS.

24:50.655 --> 24:52.532
{\an8}I JUST FEEL, LIKE, SICK.

24:52.866 --> 24:54.242
{\an8}- SO YOU HAD A GOOD NIGHT
WITH CHRIS?

24:54.326 --> 24:55.410
{\an8}- YEAH.

24:55.493 --> 24:57.579
{\an8}- OKAY, SO THAT'S GOOD.

24:57.662 --> 24:58.622
{\an8}AT LEAST--YOU KNOW WHAT?
HE'S COMING DOWN HERE.

24:58.705 --> 24:59.998
{\an8}YOU GET TO SEE HIM, SO...

25:00.332 --> 25:02.751
{\an8}- YEAH, BUT, MOM,
I'M REALLY, LIKE...

25:03.001 --> 25:04.085
{\an8}NOT MYSELF.
- WHAT?

25:04.336 --> 25:05.587
{\an8}- YOU'RE NOT YOURSELF?
- NO.

25:05.670 --> 25:07.005
{\an8}- WHY?

25:07.297 --> 25:10.133
{\an8}- I DON'T KNOW, MOM.

25:10.217 --> 25:12.302
{\an8}- DEENA,
WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?

25:12.385 --> 25:15.138
{\an8}I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY
YOU'RE ACTING LIKE THIS.

25:15.222 --> 25:16.640
{\an8}NOTHING'S CHANGED.

25:16.723 --> 25:18.141
{\an8}HE'S NOT GOING ANYWHERE,
AND YOU'RE--

25:18.433 --> 25:19.809
{\an8}- I KNOW THAT.

25:19.893 --> 25:22.646
{\an8}- AND YOU'RE ONLY PUTTING
YOURSELF THROUGH THIS.

25:22.729 --> 25:24.940
{\an8}I MEAN, I CAN'T TELL YOU
WHAT TO DO, DEENA.

25:25.232 --> 25:26.483
{\an8}YOU'RE A BIG GIRL.

25:26.566 --> 25:27.859
{\an8}YOU DO WHAT YOU HAVE
TO DO FOR YOURSELF.

25:28.151 --> 25:29.861
{\an8}- I KNOW ME AND HIM
WILL BE FINE.

25:30.153 --> 25:31.321
{\an8}I'M JUST AFRAID.

25:31.404 --> 25:33.448
{\an8}LIKE, I'M JUST...
THIS IS JUST SOMETHING--

25:33.531 --> 25:36.868
{\an8}I'VE NEVER FELT LIKE THIS
ABOUT ANYBODY BEFORE. EVER.

25:37.160 --> 25:38.536
{\an8}- 'CAUSE I'M SURE
JENNI MISSES ROGER--

25:38.620 --> 25:40.747
{\an8}- YEAH, I KNOW, BUT, MOM,
EVERYBODY'S DIFFERENT.

25:40.830 --> 25:41.998
{\an8}LIKE I'M FUCKED UP.

25:42.082 --> 25:42.874
{\an8}I'M NOT LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE.

25:43.166 --> 25:43.875
{\an8}I'M NOT NORMAL.

25:44.167 --> 25:45.502
{\an8}- YEAH, YOU ARE NORMAL.

25:45.585 --> 25:47.837
{\an8}AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU'RE STRONGER THAN THAT.

25:47.921 --> 25:50.173
{\an8}- I KNOW, LIKE, MY MOM HAS
THE BEST INTEREST FOR ME.

25:50.257 --> 25:52.342
{\an8}SHE'S JUST TRYING
TO, LIKE, GIVE ME TOUGH LOVE.

25:52.425 --> 25:53.927
{\an8}BUT RIGHT NOW
I DON'T HAVE CHRIS,

25:54.010 --> 25:56.012
{\an8}I DON'T HAVE MY MEATBALL.

25:56.096 --> 25:58.223
{\an8}SO I'M JUST KIND OF, LIKE, UGH.

25:58.306 --> 25:59.975
{\an8}I GUESS I JUST HAVE
TO GET MYSELF OUT OF IT.

26:00.267 --> 26:01.059
{\an8}- YEAH, YOU DO.

26:01.309 --> 26:02.477
{\an8}AND ONLY YOU CAN DO IT.

26:02.560 --> 26:04.312
{\an8}IS SAMMI THERE WITH YOU?

26:04.396 --> 26:05.730
{\an8}IS SHE HOME?
- YEAH, MOM.

26:06.064 --> 26:07.482
{\an8}- SO WHY DON'T YOU JUST GO
HANG OUT WITH HER?

26:07.565 --> 26:08.775
{\an8}- THAT'S WHAT I'M GONNA DO.

26:09.109 --> 26:10.610
{\an8}- TRY AND BE STRONG
AND HANG IN THERE.

26:10.694 --> 26:11.903
{\an8}- I WILL.
- I'M A PHONE CALL AWAY

26:12.237 --> 26:13.405
{\an8}IF YOU NEED ME.
- ALL RIGHT, I LOVE YOU.

26:13.488 --> 26:14.739
{\an8}- ANY TIME OF DAY OR NIGHT,
OKAY?

26:14.990 --> 26:16.408
{\an8}- MM-HMM.
both: ALL RIGHT.

26:16.491 --> 26:17.659
{\an8}- LOVE YOU.
- LOVE YOU TOO, BYE.

26:17.742 --> 26:18.743
{\an8}- BYE.

26:21.621 --> 26:22.872
{\an8}- WHAT'S THE DEAL AT 9:00?

26:23.123 --> 26:26.418
{\an8}- I'M GOING TO DINNER
WITH SAM.

26:28.586 --> 26:30.130
{\an8}- [sighs]

26:30.422 --> 26:34.092
{\an8}- YOU NEED SOME TALKING TO.

26:34.384 --> 26:36.094
{\an8}I DON'T LIKE SEEING YOU
LIKE THIS.

26:36.177 --> 26:38.805
{\an8}- INSTEAD OF, LIKE, HAVING FUN,

26:39.097 --> 26:40.807
{\an8}I'M, LIKE, BEING
A FUCKING MESS.

26:41.099 --> 26:42.350
{\an8}- LET ME TELL YOU,
I'M YOUR FRIEND.

26:42.434 --> 26:44.436
{\an8}SO I'M GONNA TELL YOU,
YOU LOOK MISERABLE.

26:44.519 --> 26:46.062
{\an8}- I TRUTHFULLY JUST MISS,

26:46.438 --> 26:50.942
{\an8}LIKE, THE HAPPY, CRAZY,
FUN-LOVING DEENA THAT I KNOW.

26:51.234 --> 26:52.777
{\an8}I DON'T LIKE SEEING YOU
GO THROUGH THIS.

26:52.861 --> 26:54.279
{\an8}- I'M GONNA COME OUT OF THIS.

26:54.571 --> 26:57.949
{\an8}- I KNOW. YOU'RE SO, LIKE,
HIGH-STRUNG TODAY.

26:58.033 --> 27:00.327
{\an8}YOUR MOM DOESN'T REALLY GET IT,
BECAUSE SHE DOESN'T REALLY KNOW.

27:00.410 --> 27:02.287
{\an8}BUT, LIKE, I KIND OF GET IT,
BECAUSE I'VE DONE IT.

27:02.370 --> 27:03.830
{\an8}- MM-HMM.
- I'VE DONE IT.

27:03.913 --> 27:05.790
{\an8}I'VE CRIED ALL THE TIME
IN THE HOUSE.

27:05.874 --> 27:07.250
{\an8}CRIED ALL THE TIME.

27:07.334 --> 27:08.209
{\an8}AND WHO WAS THE ONE
WHO WAS PICKING ME UP

27:08.501 --> 27:09.753
{\an8}AND TALKING TO ME?

27:10.003 --> 27:11.796
{\an8}YOU.

27:11.880 --> 27:13.548
{\an8}AND NOW IT'S LIKE
THE ROLES ARE SWITCHED.

27:13.631 --> 27:15.216
{\an8}AND IT'S, LIKE, I'M TRYING TO
GIVE YOU YOUR OWN ADVICE BACK.

27:15.467 --> 27:16.801
{\an8}- I KNOW.

27:17.093 --> 27:19.846
{\an8}- I THINK YOU MISS
YOUR MEATBALL.

27:19.929 --> 27:21.556
{\an8}- HOW AM I SUPPOSED
TO BE A MEATBALL BY MYSELF?

27:21.639 --> 27:24.142
{\an8}- IF YOU NEED ME TO BE
A MEATBALL, I'LL DO MY BEST.

27:24.392 --> 27:25.643
{\an8}I'M NOT THE BEST MEATBALL.

27:25.727 --> 27:27.562
{\an8}BUT I'LL DO MY BEST
TO BE YOUR MEATBALL.

27:27.645 --> 27:30.398
{\an8}- SAMMI CAN MAYBE DEFINITELY
HANG DURING THE DAY,

27:30.482 --> 27:31.816
{\an8}AND BE A MEATBALL WITH ME.

27:31.900 --> 27:33.485
{\an8}WE'LL SEE.

27:33.568 --> 27:34.861
{\an8}- ARE YOU READY TO GO?

27:35.111 --> 27:36.988
{\an8}- I DON'T KNOW.

27:37.364 --> 27:41.159
{\an8}WEREN'T YOU UP HERE
FOR, LIKE, THE WHOLE TIME?

27:41.451 --> 27:43.745
{\an8}I'M FRUSTRATED AT SAM RIGHT NOW,

27:44.079 --> 27:45.997
{\an8}BECAUSE IT'S LIKE, WE MADE PLANS
TO GO TO DINNER.

27:46.289 --> 27:49.084
{\an8}AND SHE'S NOT EVEN READY.

27:49.417 --> 27:51.586
{\an8}AND IT'S LIKE--
WHAT THE HELL'S GOING ON?

27:51.669 --> 27:54.881
{\an8}- YOU WILL GET THROUGH THIS.
- DON'T LEAVE ME.

27:59.427 --> 28:01.012
{\an8}- WHAT THE FUCK?

28:01.304 --> 28:02.680
{\an8}- DEENA HAD A MELTDOWN.

28:02.764 --> 28:04.140
{\an8}LIKE, A BAD ONE.

28:04.391 --> 28:05.141
{\an8}- WE HAD RESERVATIONS.

28:05.392 --> 28:06.518
{\an8}- I KNOW.

28:06.601 --> 28:08.853
{\an8}WHAT THE FUCK?

28:15.151 --> 28:17.153
{\an8}ASSHOLE.

28:17.445 --> 28:21.074
{\an8}I'M UPSET BECAUSE RON IS, LIKE,
MAD AT ME, YOU KNOW,

28:21.157 --> 28:23.284
{\an8}BECAUSE HE FEELS LIKE IT'S RUDE
THAT I WAS LATE FOR THE DATE

28:23.368 --> 28:24.786
{\an8}BECAUSE I WAS CARING ABOUT DEENA

28:24.869 --> 28:27.122
{\an8}AND NOT FOCUSING
ON BEING WITH HIM.

28:27.455 --> 28:29.499
{\an8}- HOW AM I AN ASSHOLE?

28:29.582 --> 28:31.751
{\an8}I HEARD YOU CALL ME
AN ASSHOLE.

28:31.835 --> 28:32.961
{\an8}SO I WONDER HOW
I'M AN ASSHOLE.

28:33.211 --> 28:34.462
{\an8}- WHEN, JUST NOW?
- YEAH.

28:34.546 --> 28:35.922
{\an8}IT'S LIKE I WANTED TO GO
TO DINNER WITH YOU.

28:36.005 --> 28:37.132
{\an8}- WELL, I'M SORRY.

28:37.382 --> 28:38.466
{\an8}- JUST LIKE FUCKING DEENA
WANTED

28:38.550 --> 28:39.759
{\an8}TO GO TO DINNER
WITH HER BOYFRIEND

28:40.093 --> 28:40.969
{\an8}AND SHE WOULD HAVE DROPPED YOU
FOR HIM.

28:41.052 --> 28:42.387
{\an8}LIKE, I'M JUST SAYING.

28:42.470 --> 28:44.097
{\an8}- I SEE, I'M SORRY.
I WAS CONSOLING MY FRIEND.

28:44.389 --> 28:45.849
{\an8}'CAUSE SHE WAS ABOUT
TO GO HOME.

28:45.932 --> 28:47.225
{\an8}- SHE'S NOT GONNA GO HOME.

28:47.559 --> 28:50.979
{\an8}- SHE CALLED HER MOM
LIKE SHE WAS GOING HOME.

28:51.229 --> 28:52.772
{\an8}OKAY, WELL, I'M SORRY.

28:52.856 --> 28:54.023
{\an8}THIS IS ACTUALLY IMPORTANT
TO ME,

28:54.315 --> 28:55.483
{\an8}GOING ON A DATE
AND BEING WITH YOU.

28:55.567 --> 28:57.777
{\an8}- ALL RIGHT, SAMMI.
WHATEVER YOU SAY.

29:02.282 --> 29:03.825
{\an8}- SO WHAT IS THE DEAL?

29:03.908 --> 29:05.535
{\an8}WE'RE TRYING TO GO TO HOOKS?
IS THAT WHAT YOUR DEAL IS?

29:05.618 --> 29:07.662
{\an8}- WE'RE GONNA GO NEXT DOOR
TO SEE IF SNOOKI WANTS TO COME.

29:07.745 --> 29:09.080
