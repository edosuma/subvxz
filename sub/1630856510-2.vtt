WEBVTT

00:01.800 --> 00:04.440
(intense music)

00:06.240 --> 00:07.000
So, what are we dealing with?

00:07.000 --> 00:08.880
We've got two devices
on the access gate.

00:08.880 --> 00:10.880
And if anyone opens
a gate, it'll go off?

00:10.880 --> 00:11.720
[Lana] Correct.

00:11.720 --> 00:13.320
[Thom] We need to get inside ASAP.

00:13.320 --> 00:14.240
What's he doing here?

00:14.240 --> 00:15.080
[Costa] He's been
back a couple of months.

00:15.080 --> 00:16.440
He's on probation.

00:16.440 --> 00:17.520
He almost had me killed.

00:17.520 --> 00:18.600
We've got a timer.

00:18.600 --> 00:20.000
Our actions must have set it off.

00:20.000 --> 00:22.080
Find cover!

00:23.960 --> 00:25.200
Let's get away from there!

00:25.200 --> 00:27.280
Take the shot!

00:28.160 --> 00:29.880
[Thom] Lana, Commander John Francis.

00:29.880 --> 00:31.240
[John] Expo Washington.

00:31.240 --> 00:32.080
Sir.

00:32.080 --> 00:33.040
Great to see a woman in the job.

00:33.040 --> 00:33.880
Is it?

00:33.880 --> 00:35.280
DCI Youngblood.

00:35.280 --> 00:37.320
Joe Hanson, the missing engineer.

00:37.320 --> 00:39.360
He is in Norford State to be interviewed.

00:39.360 --> 00:40.840
Thom and Helen, they're an item now.

00:40.840 --> 00:43.080
Sir, you should see this.

00:43.080 --> 00:43.880
What is it?

00:43.880 --> 00:45.800
Well, this is clearly a
sophisticated terrorist attack.

00:45.800 --> 00:47.720
[Speaker] Looks like the
drone fell from the west.

00:47.720 --> 00:49.480
Pilot would need an elevated position.

00:49.480 --> 00:51.000
Crayford Place car park.

00:51.000 --> 00:53.280
Yeah, someone called it
in about an hour ago.

00:53.280 --> 00:54.120
What's that?

00:54.120 --> 00:55.440
Could be a drone
controller, I'll get it.

00:55.440 --> 00:57.880
No, nobody touch anything. No!

00:57.880 --> 01:00.640
(mine clicking)
(mine exploding)

01:00.640 --> 01:01.480
Tell me.

01:01.480 --> 01:04.440
You're in the middle of a minefield.

01:04.440 --> 01:05.440
You just go, go.

01:05.440 --> 01:06.720
You should take your opportunity and go.

01:06.720 --> 01:09.240
I'm not gonna let you
die, 'cause I love you.

01:09.240 --> 01:13.120
I always have, I always will.

01:13.120 --> 01:18.200
(gun firing)
(drone exploding)

01:21.120 --> 01:23.000
There's someone on the roof
over there, the tower block.

01:23.000 --> 01:25.320
He's moving now. He's heading down.

01:25.320 --> 01:26.400
Central three five.

01:26.400 --> 01:28.280
All units to Tennison Tower, block five.

01:28.280 --> 01:29.320
Suspect is on the move.

01:29.320 --> 01:31.400
Detain anyone exiting the block.

01:47.600 --> 01:52.600
(tyres squealing)
(sirens wailing)

01:55.080 --> 02:00.080
Stop there!

02:08.360 --> 02:10.440
Hold, police! Don't move!

02:17.760 --> 02:21.680
I said, don't move! Take one
more step and I'll shoot!

02:27.600 --> 02:31.280
(Nick grunting)
Got him! Bring him in!

02:31.280 --> 02:34.360
(suspenseful music)

02:36.880 --> 02:39.640
(sirens wailing)

02:49.560 --> 02:50.320
Dad.

02:50.320 --> 02:52.400
Jesus. Honey.

02:53.120 --> 02:54.600
God, you nearly gave me a heart attack.

02:54.600 --> 02:55.720
What are you doing here?

02:55.720 --> 02:59.440
I'm keeping an eye on
the place. Like I promised.

02:59.440 --> 03:02.200
Hey, look at you. Give us a hug.

03:03.120 --> 03:06.720
Oh, come on. Double one. (chuckles)

03:06.720 --> 03:07.720
Missed ya.

03:07.720 --> 03:10.520
I missed you, too.

03:10.520 --> 03:12.400
Come on, let's have a cuppa then.

03:12.400 --> 03:15.000
I'll make you one. Come on.

03:15.000 --> 03:16.720
So, how was Ukraine?

03:16.720 --> 03:20.560
I've had some nights watching the news.

03:20.560 --> 03:22.640
I wasn't, I wasn't
actually in the Ukraine.

03:22.640 --> 03:25.280
I was in Estonia, training
bomb disposal teams,

03:25.280 --> 03:27.120
so I wasn't frontline.

03:27.120 --> 03:29.200
Well, back in one piece.

03:30.600 --> 03:32.600
It's the important thing, eh?

03:32.600 --> 03:33.880
Dad.

03:33.880 --> 03:34.880
Yes?

03:34.880 --> 03:36.960
Have you been staying here?

03:37.520 --> 03:38.280
What?

03:38.280 --> 03:40.000
I've noticed that the
spare bedding's been changed.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.600
The fridge is full of beers and food.

03:42.600 --> 03:44.720
Just at night, you know.

03:45.560 --> 03:47.560
Everything all right with Mum?

03:51.880 --> 03:53.880
Come on, Dad, talk to me.

03:58.400 --> 04:00.400
It's all messed up.

04:00.920 --> 04:02.920
What's happened?

04:06.440 --> 04:09.440
It's since we lost your brother.

04:12.720 --> 04:14.760
She won't talk.

04:14.760 --> 04:16.839
She don't talk to me about anything.

04:18.080 --> 04:23.000
Just sits there, kitchen
table, staring into space.

04:24.520 --> 04:26.560
I bring him up, she leaves the room.

04:26.560 --> 04:30.120
I carry on, she leaves the house.

04:31.040 --> 04:33.240
People deal with grief differently, Dad.

04:34.159 --> 04:36.159
They don't understand.

04:36.880 --> 04:38.880
She's so angry.

04:40.400 --> 04:42.400
She's so bitter.

04:43.840 --> 04:46.000
I'll tell you, me and her.

04:51.159 --> 04:52.920
Well, maybe you could help.

04:52.920 --> 04:53.760
You know, have a word with her,

04:53.760 --> 04:55.840
see if you can bring her out of it.

04:57.240 --> 04:58.680
Yeah, I will.

04:58.680 --> 04:59.960
Yeah?

04:59.960 --> 05:02.520
You called her, now like?

05:02.520 --> 05:04.160
No, I can't call her now, Dad,

05:04.160 --> 05:06.400
I've gotta go to a briefing.

05:06.400 --> 05:08.560
Well, you will talk to
her? You'll find the time?

05:08.560 --> 05:10.720
Yeah.

05:10.720 --> 05:12.720
Yeah, I will, I promise.

05:12.720 --> 05:14.800
Thanks, kid.

05:22.560 --> 05:24.920
(sad music)

05:32.400 --> 05:35.159
(match sparking)

05:37.480 --> 05:39.840
(sad music)

05:47.600 --> 05:50.760
(sad music continues)

06:06.680 --> 06:09.360
[Anchor] Dead and one seriously injured.

06:09.360 --> 06:12.120
Police following a tip off
went to a nearby car park,

06:12.120 --> 06:14.480
where two officers were killed.

06:14.480 --> 06:16.720
Videos of both attacks
were streamed online

06:16.720 --> 06:18.840
and have now been watched
by millions of people

06:18.840 --> 06:20.680
all around the world.

06:20.680 --> 06:24.080
This is a terrorist attack
on the centre of London

06:24.080 --> 06:26.760
and on the officers who protect it.

06:26.760 --> 06:29.880
I can assure the British public
that we in counterterrorism,

06:29.880 --> 06:31.280
will find the perpetrators

06:31.280 --> 06:33.800
and swiftly bring them to justice.

06:33.800 --> 06:35.600
If anyone has any information

06:35.600 --> 06:38.760
that they think might be
relevant to this investigation-

06:38.760 --> 06:40.240
Hello?

06:40.240 --> 06:42.320
[Speaker] You watching this?

06:42.320 --> 06:44.400
Yeah.

06:48.280 --> 06:49.960
It's everywhere.

06:49.960 --> 06:50.800
[Speaker] You did a great job

06:50.800 --> 06:53.200
erasing the power station CCTV.

06:53.200 --> 06:55.400
But now it's time to get your hands dirty.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
What do you want me to do?

07:07.640 --> 07:09.400
The traveller returns.

07:09.400 --> 07:10.240
How you doing?

07:10.240 --> 07:11.800
Good, you?

07:11.800 --> 07:13.040
Yeah, I'm all right.

07:13.040 --> 07:15.560
You know, overworked, still single.

07:15.560 --> 07:17.440
Haven't had a bloke so much
as look at me for six months.

07:17.440 --> 07:18.760
But apart from that.

07:18.760 --> 07:21.720
You don't need a bloke.
They just get in the way.

07:21.720 --> 07:23.800
Speaking of which, you seen Thom?

07:24.600 --> 07:26.600
He's got a girlfriend.

07:26.960 --> 07:28.960
I wasn't sure if you knew.

07:29.560 --> 07:31.960
Listen, I'm really sorry
about what happened to John.

07:31.960 --> 07:33.080
Sounds terrible.

07:33.080 --> 07:35.400
Yeah. Yeah, it was awful.

07:36.440 --> 07:38.000
Is that from the second drone?

07:38.000 --> 07:40.080
Yeah. What's left of it.

07:40.920 --> 07:42.480
It's a self-build.

07:42.480 --> 07:43.600
A commercially available drone

07:43.600 --> 07:45.720
wouldn't be able to carry any
more than the usual payload.

07:45.720 --> 07:46.800
Right, so the bomber would need

07:46.800 --> 07:48.360
a level of technical skill.

07:48.360 --> 07:50.000
Yeah, exactly.

07:50.000 --> 07:52.280
We've been analysing the pressure plates.

07:52.280 --> 07:54.360
Ammonium nitrate charge.

07:54.360 --> 07:56.040
Charge itself isn't that significant,

07:56.040 --> 07:58.840
but the way the plates function
is highly sophisticated

07:58.840 --> 08:01.080
and the circuitry is very advanced.

08:01.080 --> 08:02.680
Add to that, the technical skill required

08:02.680 --> 08:04.800
to get through the countermeasures
at the power station.

08:04.800 --> 08:06.360
Ex-military?

08:06.360 --> 08:08.440
Or scientist.

08:08.760 --> 08:11.600
I spoke to an electrical
engineer about how they did it.

08:13.560 --> 08:15.640
The drone descends onto the exposed wiring

08:15.640 --> 08:18.080
at the substation,
creating a short circuit.

08:18.080 --> 08:21.080
So turning the transformer
into an explosive device.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.720
Usually there are circuit
breakers that act as a fail safe.

08:25.720 --> 08:27.480
So someone turned off the fail safe.

08:27.480 --> 08:29.840
Yeah, exactly. Someone on the inside.

08:32.480 --> 08:33.919
So who are we dealing with, Omar?

08:33.919 --> 08:36.160
Anarchists? Islamists? Extreme right?

08:36.160 --> 08:37.680
I'm talking to security services,

08:37.680 --> 08:38.760
going through their watch list.

08:38.760 --> 08:40.560
Right, and?

08:40.560 --> 08:43.000
We're looking for both
intent and capability.

08:43.000 --> 08:44.480
Can't rule anything out, not yet.

08:44.480 --> 08:48.000
The messaging might be
misdirection, attempt to confuse.

08:48.000 --> 08:49.240
I'd say it was pretty clear.

08:49.240 --> 08:51.120
Yeah, but the attack
on the power station

08:51.120 --> 08:53.400
could be seen as targeting
corporate interest

08:53.400 --> 08:55.880
or perhaps even be viewed as
a direct attack on the state,

08:55.880 --> 08:57.800
similar to the IRA attacks of the '70s.

08:57.800 --> 08:59.400
They're extremists clearly,

08:59.400 --> 09:00.720
but we don't know what they want.

09:00.720 --> 09:02.360
Not yet.

09:02.360 --> 09:03.240
We've got the suspect in custody.

09:03.240 --> 09:05.280
I'm sure that will yield
further information.

09:05.280 --> 09:07.440
It better.

09:07.440 --> 09:09.120
Right, thank you everyone.

09:09.120 --> 09:10.280
As we are all well aware,

09:10.280 --> 09:13.120
there was a major terrorism
incident last night.

09:13.120 --> 09:15.320
We in counterterror
will be working closely

09:15.320 --> 09:18.280
with our friends in the security services

09:18.280 --> 09:20.440
and liaising with the home office.

09:20.440 --> 09:22.000
The threat level has
been raised to severe.

09:22.000 --> 09:22.920
What are you doing here? We got this.

09:22.920 --> 09:23.760
It's fine.

09:23.760 --> 09:25.840
[John] Thom.

09:27.080 --> 09:29.880
Last night, a bomb delivered by drone

09:29.880 --> 09:34.080
destroyed a transformer at the
Isle of Dogs power station.

09:34.080 --> 09:37.200
We identified the likeliest
location for the drone pilot,

09:37.200 --> 09:39.240
the rooftop of a multi-story carpark.

09:39.240 --> 09:42.240
Unfortunately, it now appears
that the bombers deliberately

09:42.240 --> 09:44.160
led us to this location.

09:44.160 --> 09:45.640
They wanted us to go there.

09:45.640 --> 09:47.600
The person we believe
to be the drone pilot

09:47.600 --> 09:49.680
is now in custody.

09:50.000 --> 09:51.640
His name is Nicholas Hood.

09:51.640 --> 09:54.840
27-year-old PhD student
living in New Cross.

09:54.840 --> 09:57.800
No known terrorist affiliations,
no criminal record.

09:58.760 --> 10:01.120
DS Morgan will report back
when she's questioned him.

10:01.120 --> 10:03.640
So we know that the fail
safes in the power plant

10:03.640 --> 10:05.640
were overridden.

10:05.640 --> 10:08.880
This requires both access
and technical knowledge.

10:08.880 --> 10:12.800
Two of the engineers,
Harris Grey and Liam Holby,

10:12.800 --> 10:15.000
they died in the blast.

10:15.000 --> 10:17.280
The third, Joe Hanson.

10:17.280 --> 10:18.600
He's still under medical supervision,

10:18.600 --> 10:20.920
but we will be interviewing him shortly.

10:24.880 --> 10:28.400
That.
(crowd whispering)

10:29.480 --> 10:30.920
That is a mission statement.

10:30.920 --> 10:33.920
They've targeted the power
station, the city, and us.

10:34.880 --> 10:36.040
Be under no illusion.

10:36.040 --> 10:38.440
They wanted to kill police officers.

10:38.440 --> 10:39.600
It's guerrilla warfare.

10:39.600 --> 10:41.640
Speak to your informants, your networks.

10:41.640 --> 10:43.800
Shake the trees, see what falls out.

10:43.800 --> 10:46.880
An attack of this type is
unprecedented on British soil.

10:46.880 --> 10:48.960
We cannot afford another.

10:51.160 --> 10:53.160
Let's get to it.

10:59.720 --> 11:02.600
Thom, have you spoken to the suspect?

11:02.600 --> 11:04.680
Helen's just going in with him now.

11:05.520 --> 11:06.360
A case like this,

11:06.360 --> 11:08.760
do you not think you should take the lead?

11:08.760 --> 11:10.760
She's capable.

11:10.760 --> 11:12.920
Besides I'm going to New Cross with you.

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
Okay.

11:16.880 --> 11:18.880
You live in New Cross, right?

11:19.760 --> 11:22.560
Rather high, that's a
bit of a trek, isn't it?

11:22.560 --> 11:24.640
No, not really.

11:25.120 --> 11:27.920
Jump on the scooter. No distance at all.

11:29.920 --> 11:31.960
At dawn?

11:31.960 --> 11:34.040
Well, sunrise over the river.

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
London's a beautiful city.

11:42.200 --> 11:44.520
Why were you in the tower block?

11:44.520 --> 11:45.480
I wasn't.

11:45.480 --> 11:48.360
You were seen coming
outta Tennison Tower.

11:48.360 --> 11:50.040
Not me.

11:50.040 --> 11:52.360
I mean, I was about to get on my scooter.

11:53.720 --> 11:57.280
Next thing I know, police everywhere.

11:57.280 --> 12:00.080
Mm. So you ran.

12:00.080 --> 12:01.800
And wouldn't you?

12:01.800 --> 12:03.800
Armed police officers screaming at you,

12:03.800 --> 12:05.880
threatening to shoot?

12:06.640 --> 12:09.680
You're the sole suspect in
a major terrorist incident.

12:10.640 --> 12:12.040
You might go to prison for life.

12:12.040 --> 12:14.960
I'm sorry, but you've made a mistake.

12:16.120 --> 12:18.120
You've got the wrong man.

12:21.400 --> 12:24.080
Do you have any affiliations
with terrorist groups?

12:24.080 --> 12:25.720
No.

12:25.720 --> 12:27.800
I'm a man of ideas, a scientist.

12:36.280 --> 12:38.280
What about this?

12:42.560 --> 12:44.760
Catchy.

12:44.760 --> 12:46.840
What do you think it means?

12:48.760 --> 12:49.960
Well, someone's upset.

12:49.960 --> 12:52.200
About what?

12:52.200 --> 12:54.280
Life.

12:55.400 --> 12:58.200
You think the police
only protect the elite.

12:58.200 --> 12:59.880
Is that the point?

12:59.880 --> 13:02.800
Well, we aren't all as lucky.

13:02.800 --> 13:04.880
We don't all get dealt the same hand.

13:07.040 --> 13:10.240
Yeah, inequality.

13:10.240 --> 13:12.320
Exactly.

13:13.400 --> 13:15.400
Well, take you for instance.

13:16.920 --> 13:18.840
I bet you're a hard worker.

13:18.840 --> 13:22.360
You put in the hours, at
school, you did your homework,

13:22.360 --> 13:25.120
okay results, a couple of B's.

13:25.120 --> 13:28.120
Did well enough to get you to
the police training college.

13:29.200 --> 13:31.200
And if you'd got what you deserved,

13:32.000 --> 13:34.280
you'd be way up the food chain.

13:35.680 --> 13:39.280
Whereas me, first in astrophysics,

13:39.280 --> 13:44.360
a PhD on the way and a few
years I'll be in Stanford,

13:44.880 --> 13:48.040
maybe Harvard lecturing,

13:48.040 --> 13:50.800
breeding the next
generation of scientists.

13:52.280 --> 13:57.280
Moulding great minds,
it's hardly fair, is it?

13:59.840 --> 14:01.840
Human beings.

14:02.720 --> 14:05.560
Distribution of assets, resources.

14:08.480 --> 14:12.200
Yeah, I bet you're upset
about that. Officer.

15:45.560 --> 15:47.560
Hold, police!

15:49.800 --> 15:51.480
Hold, police don't move!

15:51.480 --> 15:54.800
Down on the ground, down on the ground!

15:56.520 --> 15:59.240
Nick Hood's room, where is it?

15:59.240 --> 16:01.200
It's upstairs.

16:01.200 --> 16:03.840
(baby fussing)

16:07.280 --> 16:09.520
Clear! Room clear!

16:10.920 --> 16:13.120
Okay, thank you.
We'll take it from here.

16:19.720 --> 16:22.920
Huh, I thought the students
were meant to be messy.

16:22.920 --> 16:25.160
PhD student, he's not a fresher.

16:25.160 --> 16:27.080
Even so. The absence of the normal-

16:27.080 --> 16:30.120
Is the presence of the
abnormal. Yeah, I heard that one.

16:30.120 --> 16:32.200
Come in, lad.

16:36.040 --> 16:38.040
Thank you.

16:39.240 --> 16:41.800
So who do you think
we're dealing with here?

16:41.800 --> 16:43.640
I mean, he can't be acting alone.

16:43.640 --> 16:46.520
I can't get into specifics
related to the investigation.

16:46.520 --> 16:47.360
Why not?

16:47.360 --> 16:49.280
Because you're not a med detective.

16:49.280 --> 16:51.160
Is that you talking or Francis?

16:51.160 --> 16:52.720
I'm not at liberty to discuss

16:52.720 --> 16:54.800
sensitive information with you.

16:55.880 --> 16:59.040
You only ever say that to me
when you're pissed off at me.

16:59.040 --> 16:59.880
Pissed off?

16:59.880 --> 17:01.960
Yeah, you're acting weird.

17:02.599 --> 17:06.560
All right, then. Just tell me the truth.

17:06.560 --> 17:08.640
What about?

17:09.880 --> 17:13.440
What you said at the
car park. Did you mean it?

17:18.160 --> 17:20.040
I mean...

17:20.040 --> 17:22.640
No. No, I didn't think so.

17:25.280 --> 17:27.280
Okay guys, thank you.

17:28.960 --> 17:31.800
Hi, I'm DCI Thom Youngblood, SR15.

17:32.760 --> 17:35.840
Apologies for any disruption we've caused.

17:37.160 --> 17:39.240
What can you tell me about Nicholas Hood?

17:39.240 --> 17:40.360
What's he done?

17:40.360 --> 17:42.120
Well, I can't answer that, I'm afraid.

17:42.120 --> 17:44.040
But any information you can give me

17:44.040 --> 17:46.400
could help prevent further incident.

17:46.400 --> 17:48.480
Incident?

17:50.120 --> 17:52.120
Has he had any visitors recently?

17:53.200 --> 17:54.320
Strangers?

17:54.320 --> 17:56.160
Who did he hang out with?

17:56.160 --> 17:57.600
No one.

17:57.600 --> 18:00.080
Literally, the guy has no friends.

18:00.080 --> 18:02.560
Apart from us, and we're
more like just people

18:02.560 --> 18:03.840
that live in the same house.

18:03.840 --> 18:05.920
You must know something, anything.

18:05.920 --> 18:08.000
He's nice.

18:08.960 --> 18:11.680
Very quiet, shy, just
kept himself to himself.

18:12.840 --> 18:14.840
Apart from the babysitting.

18:16.120 --> 18:17.160
Can I see your room?

18:17.160 --> 18:19.240
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

18:25.720 --> 18:27.720
- Ah, it's in here.
- Thank you.

18:32.400 --> 18:33.800
He didn't leave anything in the room?

18:33.800 --> 18:35.880
Take a look. Nothing here.

18:37.200 --> 18:39.000
You say he babysat?

18:39.000 --> 18:41.080
Once in a while.

18:42.240 --> 18:44.240
Can I?

19:23.400 --> 19:24.800
[Thom] Are these yours?

19:24.800 --> 19:26.960
No, I've never seen them before.

19:49.600 --> 19:51.600
Mr. Hanson?

19:57.280 --> 19:59.280
I'm DS Morgan.

20:13.400 --> 20:16.600
I'm sorry to have to tell
you that your colleagues,

20:16.600 --> 20:18.800
Harris Grey and Liam Holby,

20:20.680 --> 20:22.160
they lost their lives in the blast

20:22.160 --> 20:24.240
at the power station last night.

20:32.080 --> 20:34.080
The drone was able to attack

20:35.080 --> 20:37.960
because the built-in fail
safes were inoperative.

20:40.520 --> 20:42.840
We know this couldn't
have been done remotely.

20:47.600 --> 20:50.160
We need to know if you are responsible

20:50.160 --> 20:52.840
for overriding the fail safe manually.

21:00.240 --> 21:02.240
Are you saying you were?

21:04.960 --> 21:08.200
She, she-

21:13.560 --> 21:14.880
Your wife?

21:14.880 --> 21:18.160
I think she's outside. Do
you want her to come in?

21:18.160 --> 21:20.960
(Joe whimpering)

21:27.720 --> 21:31.720
(Joe whispering unintelligibly)

21:40.440 --> 21:43.400
(dramatic music)

21:43.400 --> 21:46.200
Address is registered to a Zara Baxter.

21:46.200 --> 21:49.680
We've not approached the door
and phone's switched off.

21:49.680 --> 21:51.760
Okay.

22:21.560 --> 22:24.080
(dog barking)

22:34.040 --> 22:36.800
(dramatic music)

22:39.240 --> 22:43.160
There's a woman lying on
the floor, not moving.

22:44.160 --> 22:45.120
Have we got a device?

22:45.120 --> 22:46.400
We need to get in.

22:46.400 --> 22:47.720
Yeah, that's what they want.

22:47.720 --> 22:49.200
Lure us in, just like the car park.

22:49.200 --> 22:51.280
They're probably fucking filming us.

22:56.720 --> 22:58.520
What about the windows?

22:58.520 --> 23:00.600
I think these are wired.

23:05.680 --> 23:07.880
Danny, get a ladder now.

23:07.880 --> 23:09.960
Copy.

23:46.880 --> 23:48.880
No sign of a wire.

23:55.560 --> 23:57.560
Clear, I'm going in.

24:35.120 --> 24:37.200
Hi, I'm Lana.

24:37.200 --> 24:39.440
I'm bomb squad.

24:39.440 --> 24:41.720
I'm here to help.

24:41.720 --> 24:43.720
You're Zara, right?

24:43.720 --> 24:45.080
Get this off me.

24:45.080 --> 24:47.400
Yeah, I'm gonna help.

24:47.400 --> 24:49.840
I need to take a look at it.

24:51.320 --> 24:52.200
Get it off me.

24:52.200 --> 24:53.840
Yeah, I'm gonna help. I'm gonna help.

24:53.840 --> 24:54.960
Just need you to stay really still.

24:54.960 --> 24:57.080
The stiller you are, the better.

24:57.080 --> 24:58.840
I'm gonna take a look.

24:58.840 --> 25:01.480
We're gonna get out of here safely, okay?

25:01.480 --> 25:03.040
Okay, just deep breaths.

25:03.040 --> 25:05.120
That's all you need to do.

25:05.840 --> 25:07.840
Okay.

25:10.920 --> 25:13.080
Deep breaths. Deep breaths, Zara.

25:15.960 --> 25:18.800
(Zara whimpering)

25:25.760 --> 25:26.600
Okay.

25:26.600 --> 25:28.680
I just need to get something out my bag.

25:31.080 --> 25:33.000
You're doing great there, Zara.

25:33.000 --> 25:35.080
Really, really good.

25:35.600 --> 25:37.640
Right, I'm gonna snip this wire.

25:37.640 --> 25:39.720
Just stay still.

25:42.240 --> 25:43.000
There we go.

25:43.000 --> 25:43.840
Is that it?

25:43.840 --> 25:46.200
No. I'm just gonna check
now for a secondary switch.

25:46.200 --> 25:47.120
Okay?

25:47.120 --> 25:48.200
So I'm gonna move your
hair out of the way,

25:48.200 --> 25:50.320
let me just take a look at it.

25:50.320 --> 25:53.240
(device whirring)

25:59.560 --> 26:00.800
Let me just-

26:00.800 --> 26:01.760
What is it?

26:01.760 --> 26:03.080
Sorry, just stay still for me, please.

26:03.080 --> 26:04.000
Have you done it? Can I move?

26:04.000 --> 26:04.840
Yeah, I'm nearly there.

26:04.840 --> 26:06.320
If you can just be really still for me.

26:06.320 --> 26:07.640
Help me!

26:07.640 --> 26:09.920
Stay calm for me, please, Zara.

26:09.920 --> 26:12.280
Help me, help me!

26:12.280 --> 26:13.080
Help me!

26:13.080 --> 26:15.360
(bomb exploding)

26:15.360 --> 26:17.440
Lana!

26:21.840 --> 26:23.520
Lana, Lana, come in, get on the radio.

26:23.520 --> 26:25.600
What's happening?

26:26.800 --> 26:28.840
Lana -

26:28.840 --> 26:32.200
Central Lane 53 Expo
two, get on the radio.

26:32.200 --> 26:34.280
If you can hear me, let
me know you're okay.

26:35.000 --> 26:37.400
Lana, get on the radio if you can hear me.

26:37.400 --> 26:39.480
Can you hear me?

26:47.520 --> 26:51.280
Lana, you need to let
us know if you're okay.

26:52.680 --> 26:53.560
Danny, I'm getting nothing!

26:53.560 --> 26:55.640
Expo two.

26:56.520 --> 26:57.760
Expo two, bravo to expo two.

26:57.760 --> 26:59.240
I'm going in!

26:59.240 --> 27:02.000
Central eight five requesting
immediate expo support.

27:02.000 --> 27:03.520
100 Portski Road-

27:03.520 --> 27:04.600
- Boss!
- I need that now.

27:04.600 --> 27:05.440
Boss!

27:05.440 --> 27:06.680
I need to see if she's okay, Danny!

27:06.680 --> 27:07.640
Boss, you've got to get back!

27:07.640 --> 27:09.840
Get back.

27:09.840 --> 27:11.360
Danny, get him back.

27:11.360 --> 27:13.440
- Get a grip.
- Yeah.

27:17.120 --> 27:18.880
Make sure you get all of this

27:18.880 --> 27:21.840
and over here and get
some shots of the hands.

27:25.440 --> 27:28.280
(camera clicking)

27:32.640 --> 27:34.320
Grim stuff.

27:34.320 --> 27:36.040
So this woman, Zara Baxter,

27:36.040 --> 27:38.160
you believe there's a connection
between her and Hanson?

27:38.160 --> 27:40.680
She has pictures on her
phone of them both together,

27:40.680 --> 27:42.760
as does he.

27:43.440 --> 27:46.120
Work in theory, the bombers
used her to threaten Hanson,

27:46.120 --> 27:47.880
get him to override the fail safe.

27:47.880 --> 27:48.720
What triggered the device?

27:48.720 --> 27:50.440
Well, the woman was agitated, sir,

27:50.440 --> 27:52.480
we think an LDR was activated
setting off the time-

27:52.480 --> 27:53.960
Sorry, what's an LDR?

27:53.960 --> 27:55.560
It's a light dependent resistor.

27:55.560 --> 27:58.600
It's activated when the
light increases or decreases.

27:58.600 --> 28:00.120
Why would it increase or decrease?

28:00.120 --> 28:02.200
What would cause that to happen?

28:02.200 --> 28:04.240
I'm not sure, sir.

28:04.240 --> 28:05.800
You should speak to Expo Washington.

28:05.800 --> 28:07.880
She was there? Inside the house?

28:09.760 --> 28:11.760
She did her best.

28:12.920 --> 28:14.920
Carry on, Thom.

28:19.280 --> 28:21.960
(phone ringing)

28:27.200 --> 28:28.360
Hi, Dad.

28:28.360 --> 28:30.520
Sorry, listen, it's not a good time.

28:30.520 --> 28:32.800
[Dad] Well, I was just
wondering, did you call your mum?

28:32.800 --> 28:35.480
Yeah, I did. I left a message.

28:35.480 --> 28:36.960
[Dad] Oh, well you
said you'd speak to her.

28:36.960 --> 28:39.040
You promised.

28:39.600 --> 28:41.680
Okay, I'll call her now.

28:41.680 --> 28:43.160
Yeah, let me call you back.

28:43.160 --> 28:45.240
I'll speak to you in a minute. Bye.

28:46.880 --> 28:49.440
(Lana sighing)

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
You okay?

29:02.880 --> 29:04.880
You scared the shit out of me.

29:07.360 --> 29:09.360
I thought you were gone.

29:11.440 --> 29:13.560
Well, I'm not, but she is.

29:15.080 --> 29:17.360
Well, that wasn't your fault.

29:17.360 --> 29:19.320
Funny, isn't it?

29:19.320 --> 29:21.640
We always try and convince
ourselves of that.

29:21.640 --> 29:25.200
When someone gets killed, that
we did everything we could.

29:27.200 --> 29:29.320
You did do everything you could.

29:29.320 --> 29:31.440
I leapt out the way, that's what I did.

29:32.400 --> 29:34.400
She didn't have a chance.

29:36.920 --> 29:39.280
And if you hadn't, you'd be dead too.

29:46.200 --> 29:48.200
I'm sorry about earlier.

29:49.080 --> 29:51.080
No, you-

29:51.440 --> 29:55.840
It was me. I had no right to ask.

29:55.840 --> 29:57.520
I understand, I do.

29:57.520 --> 29:58.760
You were trying to connect with me.

29:58.760 --> 30:01.480
You were trying to get in
my head, calm me down and-

30:03.040 --> 30:04.240
(Lana sighing)

30:04.240 --> 30:07.320
Right, what I said at the car park.

30:08.440 --> 30:11.520
I meant it, it wasn't just a tactic.

30:13.160 --> 30:14.880
I've been away and I've had time to think

30:14.880 --> 30:17.120
and I don't know why I pushed
you away all that time,

30:17.120 --> 30:19.200
I don't know, but-

30:21.480 --> 30:25.720
I love you and I would
love to make it work.

30:25.720 --> 30:27.800
I'd love to try again.

30:40.800 --> 30:42.800
Me, too.

30:44.760 --> 30:47.920
Um, what about Helen?

30:51.480 --> 30:53.480
I'll talk to her.

30:55.000 --> 31:00.000
I don't want anybody
to... to get hurt, but,

31:01.800 --> 31:03.800
you know, when you have something.

31:04.760 --> 31:05.640
I've missed you so much.

31:05.640 --> 31:07.720
I fucking missed you too.

31:10.200 --> 31:13.680
You and your antics.

31:13.680 --> 31:17.240
Oh, God.

31:17.240 --> 31:20.040
(Sonia knocking)

31:24.720 --> 31:26.840
You need to see this.

31:26.840 --> 31:27.680
What is it?

31:27.680 --> 31:29.000
[Sonia] Fragments of
the internal circuit board

31:29.000 --> 31:30.920
on the neck bone.

31:30.920 --> 31:33.680
You found out that Joe
Hanson was having an affair.

31:34.680 --> 31:38.320
Presumably you hacked his
laptop, mobile, whatever.

31:40.440 --> 31:42.520
You then tried to blackmail him

31:42.520 --> 31:45.160
into helping you attack the power plant.

31:47.720 --> 31:49.720
But he refused.

31:51.120 --> 31:53.520
So you rigged his lover to a collar bomb.

31:58.240 --> 32:00.240
She died.

32:02.280 --> 32:04.280
Less than two hours ago.

32:06.320 --> 32:08.320
Head blown off.

32:10.920 --> 32:12.920
Perfectly innocent woman.

32:17.800 --> 32:19.800
What's she ever done to you?

32:22.320 --> 32:24.320
Nothing.

32:27.560 --> 32:29.640
The MRL 200, which we found at your flat,

32:29.640 --> 32:31.760
was missing an internal circuit board,

32:31.760 --> 32:34.400
which we found inside the neck device.

32:34.400 --> 32:36.640
The LDR found in your flat,

32:36.640 --> 32:39.760
identical to the one
found in the collar bomb.

32:39.760 --> 32:41.840
God, Nick, you messed this one up.

32:43.840 --> 32:45.840
I don't recognise your laws.

32:47.360 --> 32:50.520
I'm a non-subscriber to your jurisdiction.

32:51.440 --> 32:53.440
I'm exercising free will.

32:55.320 --> 32:57.400
I'm no longer a pawn.

32:57.400 --> 33:00.200
(dramatic music)

33:19.080 --> 33:19.840
Where am I?

33:19.840 --> 33:21.920
You don't need to know.

33:24.000 --> 33:28.960
Look, I told you, I'm
all in, all the way.

33:30.560 --> 33:33.960
Just tell me what you want me to do.

33:33.960 --> 33:36.040
We will.

33:54.239 --> 33:56.239
What are you doing?

34:02.760 --> 34:04.760
What's that?

34:06.840 --> 34:08.840
Insurance.

34:13.640 --> 34:16.400
(person panting)

34:20.920 --> 34:22.760
In the first interview,
did he say anything else?

34:22.760 --> 34:25.280
Anything useful before I
showed him the evidence?

34:25.280 --> 34:27.000
No, nothing.

34:27.000 --> 34:28.520
He was just playing games.

34:28.520 --> 34:30.720
He knew he was caught, he didn't care.

34:30.720 --> 34:32.800
I'll watch the tape.

34:32.800 --> 34:34.120
You coming to the briefing?

34:34.120 --> 34:34.960
No, I can't.

34:34.960 --> 34:37.560
I've gotta prep Francis,
he's meeting with the press.

34:38.520 --> 34:40.520
I think he's got a taste for it.

34:41.800 --> 34:44.920
Listen, if we have time later,

34:44.920 --> 34:46.400
do you think we could maybe sit down,

34:46.400 --> 34:48.480
have a chat, grab a drink?

34:49.120 --> 34:51.440
Yeah, yeah. Is everything all right?

34:51.440 --> 34:54.120
Um, it'd just be good to talk.

34:54.120 --> 34:56.200
- All right.
- Okay.

35:05.760 --> 35:07.760
Lana.

35:09.480 --> 35:10.280
Are you heading to the briefing, sir?

35:10.280 --> 35:12.240
No, no, I'm not.

35:12.240 --> 35:15.400
Press conference. Tedious,
but part of the job.

35:15.400 --> 35:17.480
I wanted to commend you.

35:18.000 --> 35:20.920
Earlier, it must've been
a disturbing incident.

35:20.920 --> 35:22.320
Collar bomb. That is the right term?

35:22.320 --> 35:23.840
Yeah, sir, yeah.

35:23.840 --> 35:24.680
You know, Lana,

35:24.680 --> 35:27.240
I'm a hundred percent
committed to gender equality

35:27.240 --> 35:28.080
within the met.

35:28.080 --> 35:30.200
I consider it a personal crusade.

35:31.560 --> 35:33.000
And while I understand that Expo Ray

35:33.000 --> 35:35.760
did an excellent job as
senior while you were on your

35:35.760 --> 35:37.080
sabbatical.
- Secondment.

35:37.080 --> 35:39.680
And you have had a few minor
issues since your return,

35:39.680 --> 35:42.120
I can't help thinking
We're lucky to have you.

35:42.120 --> 35:44.320
I'll be watching your
career with great interest.

35:44.320 --> 35:45.280
Carry on the good work.

35:45.280 --> 35:46.120
Thank you, sir.

35:46.120 --> 35:49.480
Sir, you'll wanna see this.

35:49.480 --> 35:51.400
What is it?

35:51.400 --> 35:53.480
Streaming now.

36:03.000 --> 36:03.760
[Radio] 23 to control.

36:03.760 --> 36:05.880
I can confirm that expo are on site.

36:09.200 --> 36:10.360
[Lana] Tell me.

36:10.360 --> 36:12.360
The ITN switchboard
got a call 25 minutes ago

36:12.360 --> 36:14.400
saying there was a device
inside one of the lifts.

36:14.400 --> 36:15.800
There are six people
trapped in the lift.

36:15.800 --> 36:18.920
It's stuck between the
fifth and the sixth floor.

36:18.920 --> 36:21.160
Do we know if it's time
command or victim operated?

36:21.160 --> 36:23.760
No, the caller hung up. And
the power's out in the lifts.

36:23.760 --> 36:25.520
We can't risk turning it back on.

36:25.520 --> 36:27.600
So we have to take the stairs.

36:34.160 --> 36:35.760
We've got a sweep of the building.

36:35.760 --> 36:38.560
This could be another trap,
keep that in mind, okay?

36:46.280 --> 36:48.280
Okay, so is this one?

36:49.440 --> 36:51.680
Need to get this door open.

37:16.400 --> 37:17.600
You've got this.

37:17.600 --> 37:19.160
Yeah, of course.

37:19.160 --> 37:20.520
Just be careful.

37:20.520 --> 37:22.600
I will.

37:50.120 --> 37:52.120
Roof clear, I'm going in.

37:58.160 --> 38:00.160
Hi, I'm Lana Washington.

38:00.160 --> 38:01.560
I'm bomb squad.

38:01.560 --> 38:04.080
Can I ask you all to move
towards the lift door please?

38:04.080 --> 38:05.520
I'm gonna drop my bag down.

38:05.520 --> 38:08.840
I'm gonna jump down and
get us out of here, okay?

38:08.840 --> 38:10.560
That's great.

38:10.560 --> 38:12.640
Okay, everybody stand back.

38:13.880 --> 38:15.880
Thank you.

38:19.800 --> 38:21.200
Okay, if you could all just head back

38:21.200 --> 38:23.400
to this wall for me now, please.

38:23.400 --> 38:24.800
Thank you.

38:24.800 --> 38:27.120
I'll get you out of here
as quickly as I can.

38:34.040 --> 38:36.040
Okay.

38:38.480 --> 38:39.600
[Danny] Lana, what's happening?

38:39.600 --> 38:42.520
I'm in the lift. We're
gonna evacuate shortly.

38:42.520 --> 38:44.600
Danny, I'm gonna need a second ladder.

39:06.520 --> 39:09.440
Danny, as quick as you can, please.

39:20.560 --> 39:22.360
There you go. Come on.

39:22.360 --> 39:23.600
Yeah, this way.

39:23.600 --> 39:25.920
This way, madam.

39:25.920 --> 39:28.120
Just wait here.

39:28.120 --> 39:30.440
You wait here. There's one more
and then I'll take you down.

39:30.440 --> 39:32.400
Thank you.

39:32.400 --> 39:33.720
Okay, up you go.

39:33.720 --> 39:34.920
I'm fine here.

39:34.920 --> 39:36.800
You've got to leave the lift, sir.

39:36.800 --> 39:39.280
No, I don't think I do.

39:39.280 --> 39:41.880
I'm a bomb disposal officer.
I'm telling you you do.

39:41.880 --> 39:43.960
Yeah, I heard your orders.

39:44.720 --> 39:45.960
I don't choose to take them.

39:45.960 --> 39:48.040
Why not?

39:48.400 --> 39:50.120
That's a bomb in there, is it?

39:50.120 --> 39:51.200
Well, I don't know.

39:51.200 --> 39:53.000
I can't check until you leave.

39:53.000 --> 39:55.800
Well, I choose to stay.

39:55.800 --> 39:59.320
I choose not to be intimidated
by these meaningless threats.

39:59.320 --> 40:01.840
People died yesterday,
at the power plant.

40:01.840 --> 40:02.880
Some shitty car park.

40:02.880 --> 40:03.350
You were there?

40:03.350 --> 40:04.520
Yeah, I was there.

40:04.520 --> 40:06.520
You didn't just read it in
the paper like everyone else?

40:06.520 --> 40:08.520
Watch it online? TV?

40:08.520 --> 40:11.000
It's not just another
way of controlling us?

40:11.000 --> 40:12.679
Bomb scares, vaccines?

40:12.679 --> 40:15.520
Okay, right. Are you
refusing to leave the lift?

40:15.520 --> 40:17.599
I am.

40:18.400 --> 40:20.599
Danny, will you bring me
the bomb blanket please?

40:20.599 --> 40:21.440
[Danny] Copy.

40:21.440 --> 40:22.279
What's a bomb blanket?

40:22.279 --> 40:23.199
It's something we use in the military.

40:23.199 --> 40:25.360
It's to protect you.

40:25.360 --> 40:27.599
How can it protect us?
We're in a steel box.

40:27.599 --> 40:29.679
If a bomb did go off-

40:30.279 --> 40:32.279
Thanks.

40:32.679 --> 40:33.799
What? You staying?

40:33.799 --> 40:35.279
Well, this gentleman's
refusing to leave,

40:35.279 --> 40:37.040
so I'm gonna have to
deal with this manually.

40:37.040 --> 40:39.119
Mate, have you got a
death wish or something?

40:40.520 --> 40:41.799
Okay, this is your last chance.

40:41.799 --> 40:43.920
I would suggest you leave now with Danny.

40:44.799 --> 40:46.799
I'm staying.

40:48.400 --> 40:49.639
Boss.

40:49.639 --> 40:50.880
What's the story?

40:50.880 --> 40:52.520
He said he's not coming.

40:52.520 --> 40:54.960
Sir, I do strongly advise you to leave.

40:56.759 --> 40:58.759
Thom, it's all right. I've got this.

41:00.440 --> 41:01.400
Right, take the ladder, Danny,

41:01.400 --> 41:02.759
and get everybody back please.

41:02.759 --> 41:04.839
All right.

41:07.360 --> 41:10.440
Right, Lana, I'll see you down there.

42:23.040 --> 42:25.880
Just a jammer. Stops
the lift from operating.

42:28.400 --> 42:30.400
You can take that off now.

42:34.960 --> 42:36.960
Expo two, we've got a jammer.

42:37.960 --> 42:38.719
All clear.

42:38.719 --> 42:40.920
Central eight five, received.

42:40.920 --> 42:43.199
Central three five, can
you reinstate power?

42:49.440 --> 42:51.440
All right.

42:52.079 --> 42:54.079
Ground floor.

42:54.520 --> 42:56.520
Soft furnishing and menswear.

42:58.079 --> 43:00.079
You can pick up some new pants.

43:01.239 --> 43:03.239
I told you it was nothing.

43:08.599 --> 43:10.400
(bomb exploding)
(people screaming)

43:10.400 --> 43:13.599
Okay guys, just keep
following the stairs down,

43:13.599 --> 43:15.279
there'll be officers waiting
for you at the bottom.

43:15.279 --> 43:18.559
Keep following down, stay calm! Stay calm!

43:18.559 --> 43:20.119
[Danny] Expo two bravo to expo two.

43:20.119 --> 43:22.199
Lana, you okay? Lana!

43:22.839 --> 43:24.119
Central eight five,
I heard an explosion,

43:24.119 --> 43:25.360
anyone got eyes on expo two?

43:25.360 --> 43:26.599
Repeat eyes on expo two?

43:26.599 --> 43:28.199
You can't be here,
sir, you have to go down.

43:28.199 --> 43:29.520
No, I'm expo 15. What's going on?

43:29.520 --> 43:30.759
Explosion in one of the list shafts.

43:30.759 --> 43:33.119
Where's the nearest access point?

43:33.119 --> 43:35.960
(dramatic music)

43:40.480 --> 43:43.360
There could be people trapped inside.

43:44.400 --> 43:46.400
So can you stand back, please?

43:49.239 --> 43:52.000
(dramatic music)

44:00.719 --> 44:01.679
Oh, God.

44:01.679 --> 44:03.759
What?

44:04.839 --> 44:06.839
Just look.

44:13.119 --> 44:14.319
What?

44:14.319 --> 44:19.400
(Thom yelling)
(body crashing)

44:21.559 --> 44:24.279
(dramatic music)

44:32.040 --> 44:35.599
(dramatic music continues)

44:41.599 --> 44:45.159
(dramatic music continues)

44:51.559 --> 44:55.119
(dramatic music continues)

45:07.719 --> 45:10.319
(light jingle)
