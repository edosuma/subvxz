03:16.611 --> 03:19.114
Hey Tom, how you doing?

03:19.146 --> 03:22.183
Tom, I told you I
don't speak Polish.

03:22.217 --> 03:23.886
Besides, I'm not Angie.

03:23.919 --> 03:27.689
I'm Anthony and you know I
came to this country years ago.

03:27.723 --> 03:29.058
Anyway, what's up?

03:29.091 --> 03:31.060
Hey by the way, do you
know where Matt is?

03:32.627 --> 03:35.129
No, I haven't seen
him for a long period of time.

03:35.163 --> 03:36.632
Yeah, me too.

03:36.664 --> 03:39.634
That's the problem,
he just disappeared.

03:39.668 --> 03:42.771
Oh come on. It's
Matt, he should be fine.

03:42.804 --> 03:44.272
By the way, do you
want to hit the bar?

03:44.306 --> 03:46.975
Nah, I'm exhausted.

03:47.008 --> 03:49.811
A lot of work, important
projects, you know?

03:49.844 --> 03:50.979
You on a
little bit tighter?

03:51.013 --> 03:54.950
- I really need some rest.
- As usual.

03:54.983 --> 03:57.953
Hey, what about that girl you
met a couple of weeks back?

03:57.985 --> 03:59.020
You should go with her.

04:00.822 --> 04:01.890
Nothing.

04:01.924 --> 04:03.893
Why? She's cool.

04:03.925 --> 04:06.060
You know, she's strange.

04:06.093 --> 04:09.597
- She picks her nose too often.
- Gotcha.

04:09.631 --> 04:12.568
You are definitely
unlucky with girls, dude.

04:12.600 --> 04:14.871
Yeah, beautiful.
It looks like it.

04:16.003 --> 04:18.973
Okay. Hey,
we'll see you bro.

04:19.007 --> 04:20.141
Yeah.

04:20.175 --> 04:22.011
See ya,

04:22.043 --> 04:22.844
bye.

04:39.995 --> 04:42.131
And would come
back to the United States.

05:04.987 --> 05:05.788
Okay.

05:48.062 --> 05:50.966
It was lovely meeting you.

05:50.999 --> 05:53.302
- Michelle.
- Thank you.

05:53.334 --> 05:56.704
- Am I special?
- Yeah, I like that one.

06:10.851 --> 06:13.021
That's Matt's apartment.

07:14.415 --> 07:17.118
You see
life? Look at his blood.

07:20.088 --> 07:22.157
The crazy bastard
split his head open.

07:22.189 --> 07:24.459
What
shall we do now?

07:24.492 --> 07:26.127
Call 911 I guess.

07:29.064 --> 07:31.067
Do you want us to
call you an ambulance?

07:32.067 --> 07:33.502
No, thanks.

07:35.937 --> 07:38.139
Okay, let's help
him to his feet then.

07:41.309 --> 07:42.144
Come on.

07:45.180 --> 07:48.182
So, here we are then.

07:48.216 --> 07:49.518
Where have you been, man?

07:49.550 --> 07:52.553
I haven't seen you for a
week, no messages, no calls.

07:52.586 --> 07:54.122
I was ready to call your mom.

07:54.156 --> 07:56.091
Ha, yeah, I can just imagine

07:56.124 --> 07:57.793
how that conversation would go.

07:57.826 --> 07:59.261
I almost called
ICE and told them

07:59.293 --> 08:02.764
you were Mexican so they
would know how to find you.

08:02.798 --> 08:04.031
You know that's not true.

08:04.064 --> 08:06.035
- They don't care.
- Guys.

08:07.935 --> 08:09.337
Drinks for the guys.

08:09.370 --> 08:11.106
- Thanks, gorgeous.
- Thank you.

08:21.216 --> 08:24.552
So, are you gonna tell
me where you've been?

08:24.586 --> 08:26.254
Oh, sorry mate.

08:26.288 --> 08:28.157
So, get this.

08:28.189 --> 08:29.891
The other week, I'm watching TV,

08:29.925 --> 08:32.894
this documentary,
right, about Russia.

08:34.260 --> 08:35.863
Are you serious?

08:35.897 --> 08:37.131
Yeah, Russia.

08:37.164 --> 08:40.168
Honestly, it's the best
place I have ever been.

08:40.201 --> 08:41.937
Bars are open all night,

08:41.970 --> 08:45.574
insane nightclubs
and well, the women.

08:45.606 --> 08:48.442
Stop, okay. For
example, Russia.

08:48.475 --> 08:51.112
But how did you
communicate with them?

08:51.145 --> 08:54.048
They all speak English
there. It's so easy.

09:00.422 --> 09:02.224
What's wrong with your face?

09:02.256 --> 09:04.092
You having a stroke
or something?

09:05.427 --> 09:07.629
- Oh, oh, Natasha.
- Shh.

09:07.662 --> 09:09.965
- Yeah, Natasha.
- Crazy story, right?

09:09.998 --> 09:11.500
I went to the
restaurant one night,

09:11.533 --> 09:14.036
you know, hoping to sink a few.

09:14.068 --> 09:15.303
I see this girl, Natasha.

09:15.336 --> 09:17.605
She's there with
one of her friends.

09:17.639 --> 09:21.310
Our eyes met from
across the room.

09:21.342 --> 09:23.511
It was like one of those
scenes from a movie.

09:23.544 --> 09:27.415
So we're getting a couple of
drinks, having a bit of a dance

09:27.448 --> 09:29.116
and she took me
into the bathroom

09:29.149 --> 09:33.154
and you know, we had
a bit of a rendezvous.

09:33.187 --> 09:35.256
Oh my god, that's disgusting.

09:35.289 --> 09:37.425
What are you, 15
years old? Come on.

09:37.458 --> 09:40.528
Hey wait, I know. You
should go to Russia.

09:40.562 --> 09:41.596
You'd love it there.

09:41.629 --> 09:43.130
I'll even go write down the name

09:43.163 --> 09:44.298
- of the place I met Natasha.
- Are you serious?

09:44.331 --> 09:46.000
Yeah of course, why not?

09:47.168 --> 09:49.671
I have a job. I have
important projects.

09:49.703 --> 09:53.007
I don't know, because I have-

09:53.041 --> 09:56.411
- Because, because, look at me.

09:56.443 --> 09:58.512
I'm Anthony, my wife left me.

09:58.546 --> 10:00.449
I'm always so
depressed and upset

10:00.481 --> 10:02.149
and I stay in my
apartment all the time.

10:02.182 --> 10:04.253
Okay, come on.

10:04.285 --> 10:05.453
Come on, mate.

10:05.486 --> 10:07.221
All you do is sit in
your apartment all day

10:07.254 --> 10:10.325
and worry and complain
about how she left you.

10:10.357 --> 10:12.260
Darling?

10:12.293 --> 10:13.562
Ah, coming, gorgeous.

10:13.595 --> 10:16.163
Anyway mate, the best thing
you could ever, ever do.

10:16.197 --> 10:18.332
You can meet a girl
like Natasha yourself.

10:18.365 --> 10:19.668
You'll be all right, mate.

10:20.735 --> 10:21.971
Coming, gorgeous.

10:40.956 --> 10:43.091
And here we go.

10:53.067 --> 10:56.571
Why can't you ever
fry it a little more?

10:56.604 --> 10:59.206
But you like it this way.

10:59.240 --> 11:01.677
I like it
fried a little more.

11:41.548 --> 11:43.251
Honey, I'm off.

11:56.398 --> 11:57.365
Mario's here.

12:08.308 --> 12:10.812
Hey sweetheart. I forgot my-

12:22.456 --> 12:23.524
People refer

12:23.557 --> 12:25.527
to me and I get
really upset about it.

12:25.559 --> 12:27.328
- Well, I'm 42.
- 42?

12:27.361 --> 12:31.299
And they call that young.

12:54.322 --> 12:56.725
Oh, Tony. Tony,
over here mate.

12:58.326 --> 12:59.595
- Hey guys.
- Hello.

13:00.794 --> 13:03.497
Gorgeous, you remember
our Tony from yesterday?

13:03.530 --> 13:05.866
Here he is trying to
keep himself in shape.

13:05.899 --> 13:06.668
Hey.

13:08.336 --> 13:10.672
You see Tony here, he's
always working on that

13:10.705 --> 13:15.644
body of his but not really
for the right purpose.

13:15.677 --> 13:17.413
Don't be so rude, pumpkin.

13:18.613 --> 13:21.650
Look, ducks. May I
go feed the ducks?

13:21.682 --> 13:22.784
Of course, darling.

13:31.259 --> 13:33.361
So, did you think
about my holiday idea?

13:34.495 --> 13:35.529
Oh man, I don't know.

13:35.562 --> 13:37.865
That's too hard to leave it all

13:37.899 --> 13:40.235
behind and go,
especially to Russia.

13:43.138 --> 13:44.473
When did you start
playing football?

13:44.505 --> 13:47.341
This, approximately
one hour ago.

13:48.775 --> 13:50.177
Impressive.

13:50.211 --> 13:52.313
Mate, it's because
of this girl,

13:52.346 --> 13:55.350
It's honestly the best thing
that has ever happened to me.

13:55.383 --> 13:56.585
I mean I'm trying new things

13:56.618 --> 13:58.420
I never would have
thought I'd done.

13:58.452 --> 14:02.591
I've always wanted to play
football but how insane is that?

14:02.624 --> 14:04.259
On that note, check this out.

14:04.292 --> 14:06.195
Hey darling, catch.

14:08.962 --> 14:09.897
Ooh.

14:11.966 --> 14:13.534
Is she okay?

14:13.567 --> 14:15.504
She's tough.
She can handle it.

14:17.471 --> 14:20.574
Listen, I know that you've
gone through a divorce

14:20.607 --> 14:23.544
but I'm starting to think
that the issue is with you

14:23.577 --> 14:26.947
and not with that stupid
cow of an ex-wife of yours.

14:26.980 --> 14:29.283
You have to get out
there and meet someone.

14:30.485 --> 14:32.954
Mate, I know, I know
but you do nothing but

14:32.986 --> 14:36.290
work behind your desk 24-seven
on those silly projects.

14:36.323 --> 14:37.892
You just need to take
a bit of time off.

14:37.926 --> 14:40.362
Get out there. See the
world, have a vacation.

14:40.394 --> 14:44.298
Even for a week, get out there
and find your own Natasha.

14:44.331 --> 14:46.433
I don't know,
dude. It's too hard.

14:46.466 --> 14:48.502
Come on mate,
you're my best friend.

14:48.535 --> 14:49.770
I'm worried about you.

14:49.803 --> 14:52.341
I need you to be happy.
I want you to be happy.

14:53.640 --> 14:55.943
Hey gorgeous, Natasha,
come over here.

14:57.445 --> 14:59.181
Hey, gorgeous.

14:59.214 --> 15:01.383
Don't you think my friend here

15:01.416 --> 15:03.985
is an attractive
single young man?

15:04.018 --> 15:07.923
You are single? I can't
believe this, how come?

15:08.855 --> 15:10.225
I don't know.

15:10.258 --> 15:12.360
And you've never
been to Russia?

15:12.393 --> 15:13.562
Nope.

15:13.595 --> 15:16.298
You have to go there.
You won't regret it.

15:16.331 --> 15:18.500
But I've heard so
much crazy stuff.

15:18.533 --> 15:21.403
We have amazing
places, bars restaurants,

15:21.436 --> 15:23.638
anything a person can wish for.

15:23.671 --> 15:26.341
People are so
hospitable and open too.

15:26.374 --> 15:27.709
That's what I've been
trying to tell him.

15:27.741 --> 15:29.910
Absolutely, many
people get scared about

15:29.943 --> 15:33.649
how many witches we have but
it's all grandma's tales.

15:36.384 --> 15:38.419
Maybe, maybe you're right.

15:38.452 --> 15:39.620
You've gotta do it.

15:39.653 --> 15:41.355
You know I love you. I
want you to be happy.

15:41.389 --> 15:42.957
Seriously, I'd love to
stay and chat longer

15:42.990 --> 15:44.992
but we've got abseiling
at 1:00 p.m. today.

15:45.025 --> 15:47.728
We've gotta get going but
I'll talk to you soon, okay?

15:49.297 --> 15:50.766
It's been great
to see you, mate.

15:51.732 --> 15:53.534
- Talk to you soon, okay?
- Okay.

15:53.567 --> 15:56.270
- Are you ready, honey?
- Bye, bye, Anthony.

15:56.303 --> 15:58.573
Okay, bye guys, take care.

16:11.586 --> 16:13.822
I've always dreamed
of somebody like you.

16:19.494 --> 16:22.497
You're 1,000 times
better than Matt.

16:25.365 --> 16:27.235
As soon as I saw you,

16:28.035 --> 16:29.537
I decided to dump him.

16:45.385 --> 16:46.420
People refer to me,

16:46.453 --> 16:47.755
I get really upset about it.

16:47.788 --> 16:49.723
- How old are you?
- I'm 42.

16:49.756 --> 16:51.292
- Oh, 42.
- Oh my-

16:58.466 --> 17:00.369
I'm so glad
you decided to go.

17:01.735 --> 17:03.938
Natasha must've made quite
an impression on you.

17:04.872 --> 17:06.508
Yeah. She's great.

17:07.709 --> 17:11.078
But tell me the
truth. Did you like her?

17:11.112 --> 17:12.247
What do you mean?

17:12.279 --> 17:14.348
Well I bet you've
already been imagining how you'd

17:14.382 --> 17:17.585
steal her away from him,
dreaming about her day and night.

17:17.617 --> 17:21.423
What are you talking about?
I never thought about this.

17:21.454 --> 17:26.359
Come on. Your eyes
totally gave you away, dude.

17:27.694 --> 17:29.897
You didn't think about
this? You little bastard.

17:30.731 --> 17:32.466
Wait, wait a second.

17:32.500 --> 17:34.303
My favorite t-shirt.

17:38.972 --> 17:40.341
What's going on?

17:41.075 --> 17:43.111
Dude, you still there?

17:44.644 --> 17:46.914
To be honest, I'm not sure

17:46.948 --> 17:49.617
if I'm making the right
decision right now.

17:49.650 --> 17:51.953
Of course you are.

17:51.986 --> 17:54.756
It's better than sitting and
waiting there at any rate.

17:56.124 --> 17:59.827
I'm sure you'll find an
excellent girl for yourself

17:59.861 --> 18:02.431
and Natasha will
have company here.

18:03.530 --> 18:06.033
Well, maybe you're right.

18:07.034 --> 18:08.437
Hopefully it'll work out.

18:09.436 --> 18:10.838
- Okay, see you later.
- Okay.

18:10.872 --> 18:12.073
See you later, pal.

18:12.105 --> 18:14.375
Hey, keep me
posted on everything.

18:44.105 --> 18:46.741
Excuse me, sir. How long
will it take to get there?

18:49.176 --> 18:52.045
A little under an hour,
mister tourist, yeah.

18:52.078 --> 18:54.883
Okay.

18:54.915 --> 18:58.953
If there is a picture at
the entrance to the city.

19:00.520 --> 19:01.757
Okay. Thank you.

19:03.156 --> 19:04.125
Now,

19:04.157 --> 19:05.759
I can see

19:05.792 --> 19:08.729
you are foreigner,
mister tourist, yeah?

19:10.163 --> 19:10.999
Yes sir.

19:13.000 --> 19:14.769
Where from,

19:14.801 --> 19:15.869
American,

19:15.903 --> 19:17.771
Englishman?

19:17.805 --> 19:19.141
Minneapolis, USA.

19:20.607 --> 19:21.442
Minneapolis?

19:22.309 --> 19:25.446
America, yeah?
Minneapolis, America.

19:25.480 --> 19:27.015
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

19:27.048 --> 19:28.849
Excuse me, excuse me.

19:28.883 --> 19:30.585
Very good, Minneapolis.

19:30.617 --> 19:33.253
Good for the body, yeah?

19:33.287 --> 19:34.721
Yes sir.

19:34.755 --> 19:36.858
Excuse me, a sportsman.

19:36.891 --> 19:41.730
A sportsman, yeah, yeah? A
sportsman.

19:42.195 --> 19:43.564
Here

19:43.597 --> 19:46.134
for business or
for a break, hmm?

19:46.166 --> 19:49.837
Kind of business but maybe
I'll meet some beauties too.

19:49.871 --> 19:52.941
Oh, good for the
American, yeah, yeah.

19:54.307 --> 19:58.012
You'll meet for sure.
You'll meet for sure, yeah.

19:59.012 --> 19:59.947
I understand, mate.

20:02.083 --> 20:04.249
The main thing

20:04.519 --> 20:07.923
is not to meet a
witch, as my wife was.

20:17.030 --> 20:19.767
Not witch, not witch.

20:19.799 --> 20:20.734
But it's

20:21.836 --> 20:24.038
all the time lack of money.

20:26.807 --> 20:28.742
Lack of money,

20:28.776 --> 20:30.711
lack of everything

20:30.744 --> 20:32.779
all the time.

20:32.813 --> 20:35.182
Everything all the time.

20:37.852 --> 20:38.987
Lack of money.

20:40.221 --> 20:41.690
A lack of money.

20:43.257 --> 20:44.793
Is everything all right, sir?

20:49.596 --> 20:53.166
Well, well, I love very much
,

20:53.200 --> 20:57.105
so much that I
drank a lot of juice

20:57.137 --> 20:59.206
and can't stand it.

20:59.240 --> 21:00.341
Can't stand it.

21:00.374 --> 21:01.543
Captain, captain,

21:02.576 --> 21:03.744
can I stop the car?

21:03.778 --> 21:07.315
- Can I stop the car?
- Of course. No problem.

21:07.347 --> 21:08.182
Thanks.

21:10.317 --> 21:11.853
Bro American, bro.

22:04.238 --> 22:05.206
Do you need help?

22:09.943 --> 22:10.878
It's fine.

22:12.145 --> 22:14.281
But your pee is red.

22:18.019 --> 22:18.853
Red?

22:21.122 --> 22:22.090
My pee is red.

22:28.128 --> 22:28.996
Red.

22:30.897 --> 22:31.732
And so what?

22:35.935 --> 22:36.770
I just drank

22:37.904 --> 22:39.840
too much tomato
juice, so it's red.

22:42.375 --> 22:46.213
What color liquid we drink,
such the color we pee.

22:47.347 --> 22:48.750
Stop.

22:50.851 --> 22:52.187
Is that what you say
when you're there?

22:53.854 --> 22:55.023
- Nope.
- In America.

22:55.923 --> 22:56.891
Take a seat.

22:58.425 --> 23:00.994
Take a seat, let's go.

23:01.028 --> 23:03.397
♪ And we go ♪

23:07.034 --> 23:08.436
Come on, let's go.

23:24.117 --> 23:25.854
Your room is 321,

23:26.953 --> 23:28.355
there you go.

23:28.388 --> 23:29.189
Thank you.

23:30.391 --> 23:32.894
If you have any
questions or problems,

23:32.926 --> 23:34.928
please feel free
to call anytime.

23:36.130 --> 23:38.700
Hopefully I won't have
any problems, thanks.

23:38.732 --> 23:39.400
Okay.

26:00.875 --> 26:04.912
You're so handsome.

26:04.944 --> 26:05.946
So strong.

26:07.381 --> 26:08.216
So real.

26:14.255 --> 26:15.590
Its time to look

26:17.258 --> 26:18.092
for a bar.

26:50.557 --> 26:52.894
It seems like this
trip should be nice.

27:32.499 --> 27:34.935
Oh man, you are goddamn sexy.

27:37.304 --> 27:38.973
All the girls are
gonna be yours.

27:48.115 --> 27:51.051
Good evening. Are
you feeling okay?

27:51.085 --> 27:52.353
Can I help you with anything?

27:52.385 --> 27:54.488
Oh, everything's
great. Thank you.

27:54.520 --> 27:56.657
I need a taxi to
get to this place.

27:58.224 --> 27:59.459
It's a nice bar.

28:02.328 --> 28:04.999
You know this great
theater performance

28:05.031 --> 28:06.733
playing now in our city,
,

28:08.801 --> 28:11.972
it will be more exciting
than the regular bar.

28:12.006 --> 28:14.075
Thanks but I'll
stick with the bar.

28:15.209 --> 28:18.278
Okay, taxi will
wait in five minutes.

28:18.311 --> 28:21.048
Oh, thanks a lot. Great.

28:21.080 --> 28:22.950
- Have a nice day.
- Bye.

29:34.587 --> 29:36.624
- Yeah, hello.
- Follow me, please.

29:36.656 --> 29:37.491
Sure.

31:33.574 --> 31:36.344
- Excuse me?
- You are not from here.

31:37.510 --> 31:40.614
Handsome man, are you alone?

31:40.646 --> 31:41.848
Right now, I'm alone.

31:43.016 --> 31:45.653
By the way, your
dance was impressive.

31:45.685 --> 31:47.387
Thank you.

31:47.421 --> 31:48.989
What is your name?

31:49.021 --> 31:50.723
Anthony, and yours?

31:50.757 --> 31:51.826
My name is Nina.

31:58.531 --> 32:00.833
So, where are you from?

32:00.866 --> 32:05.239
Just a moment, "I am
from America," right?

32:07.039 --> 32:09.276
You are absolutely right.

32:09.308 --> 32:10.478
Minneapolis, USA

32:12.679 --> 32:14.982
and please, let me be
very straight with you.

32:15.015 --> 32:16.651
You look stunning.

32:28.561 --> 32:31.030
Your lips are so soft.

32:31.064 --> 32:32.567
You're a good kisser.

32:35.368 --> 32:37.837
I'm good at many things.

32:41.375 --> 32:42.777
Oh, I don't doubt that.

32:44.377 --> 32:47.948
So sweetie, how long
are you staying in Russia?

32:49.048 --> 32:50.017
For one week

32:51.518 --> 32:56.390
but I love it here so much,
I would stay here forever.

32:57.023 --> 32:58.225
Sounds sexy.

32:59.459 --> 33:00.995
Just let me go to
the ladies room

33:01.028 --> 33:04.397
to fix my makeup and
my lipstick after you.

33:06.633 --> 33:08.035
Don't go anywhere.

33:09.869 --> 33:11.238
Of course. No problem.

33:13.105 --> 33:13.907
Wow.

33:19.880 --> 33:21.482
Do not kiss her.

33:22.481 --> 33:23.850
What? Why?

33:23.884 --> 33:26.487
Anyway, it's too late.
We've already kissed.

33:26.519 --> 33:27.721
She's a witch.

33:28.855 --> 33:32.293
A witch? Witches have
gone for 500 years.

33:33.125 --> 33:34.394
I warned you.

33:38.964 --> 33:39.899
Wait, you have-

33:50.376 --> 33:52.745
Feel free to order
anything you want.

33:52.778 --> 33:55.415
Waiter, the best
vodka you have please.

33:57.917 --> 34:02.655
You are so
generous, brave, sexy.

34:02.689 --> 34:04.892
Yeah, I've got this
department covered.

34:06.026 --> 34:07.762
Then we will go to mine then?

34:09.396 --> 34:10.931
To yours, and
where do you live?

34:13.166 --> 34:14.467
On the moon.

34:16.436 --> 34:17.972
I've never been on the moon.

34:21.806 --> 34:22.643
Let's go.

34:26.980 --> 34:28.681
Let's go.

34:28.715 --> 34:29.550
Let's go.

34:32.952 --> 34:34.487
Be careful.

34:34.521 --> 34:35.989
I think I drank too much.

34:36.021 --> 34:37.791
I think it's okay.

34:43.396 --> 34:44.065
Darling.

34:52.472 --> 34:54.041
- Interesting neighborhood.
- Yes.

34:54.074 --> 34:56.876
- Lots of fun around here.
- Are we there yet?

34:58.077 --> 35:00.880
Are you running
out of patience?

36:00.773 --> 36:02.108
Is anybody here?

36:33.907 --> 36:35.742
- Which floor do you live on?
- Third.

37:12.679 --> 37:16.182
What a long
staircase, are we close?

37:16.215 --> 37:18.818
It seems to me like we've
been going up forever now.

37:20.186 --> 37:22.923
We are almost there,
just a little more.

37:22.956 --> 37:25.559
Three or 400 steps left.

37:32.632 --> 37:34.134
No, no, no, handsome man.

37:37.771 --> 37:38.772
Take a look.

37:44.210 --> 37:46.146
Okay, I have some power.

37:58.724 --> 37:59.592
Welcome.

38:01.193 --> 38:04.297
It's pretty dark
in here, isn't it?

38:07.099 --> 38:09.936
Wow, you have that cool thing.

38:09.969 --> 38:12.572
You can wait for me there.

38:13.340 --> 38:14.675
I'll be back in a minute.

38:18.644 --> 38:19.346
Okey-dokey.

38:33.760 --> 38:34.628
Okay.

38:37.197 --> 38:38.032
Let's play.

39:13.967 --> 39:14.969
Wow.

39:24.443 --> 39:25.378
Wait a second.

39:29.882 --> 39:30.717
It's Matt.

39:33.452 --> 39:36.188
That's Matt in the
picture. Do you know him?

39:36.222 --> 39:37.891
Who doesn't?

39:37.923 --> 39:39.826
He is very popular around here.

39:39.858 --> 39:41.894
Seriously? What for?

39:41.927 --> 39:43.429
Doesn't matter.

39:43.463 --> 39:47.201
Tonight is not about
him, but about us.

40:12.458 --> 40:13.259
Neat.

41:19.224 --> 41:21.228
Come on, that's just vodka.

41:22.161 --> 41:23.362
Keep it together.

42:33.867 --> 42:34.535
Okay.

42:55.121 --> 42:58.090
You know, I actually am a
professional in this kind of game.

43:11.536 --> 43:12.872
Yeah.

43:14.539 --> 43:15.342
I like it.

43:19.177 --> 43:20.446
You're so sharp.

43:30.556 --> 43:31.358
Oh yeah.

43:33.425 --> 43:34.260
You are so hot.

43:37.429 --> 43:38.931
I can't wait anymore.

43:50.610 --> 43:51.478
Gotcha.

43:53.445 --> 43:54.614
You're all mine.

44:12.699 --> 44:14.934
Please help, let me in.

44:45.398 --> 44:47.334
Come on, come on, open up.

44:51.804 --> 44:54.608
Please, please, please, let
me in, let me in, let me in.

44:56.074 --> 44:58.611
Oh thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you.

45:12.224 --> 45:13.726
Thank you very
much for the help.

45:20.099 --> 45:21.234
Nice apartment.

45:44.824 --> 45:45.659
Get off.

45:52.097 --> 45:53.567
How long have you lived here?

45:56.702 --> 45:59.239
Has anything strange ever
happened here before?

46:02.108 --> 46:03.810
Maybe we should call the police.

46:08.748 --> 46:11.617
Okay, I think I will
go. Thank you again.

46:15.088 --> 46:16.323
You are mine.

47:39.204 --> 47:43.509
What's the matter? I
haven't seen you for ages, eh?

47:43.543 --> 47:44.744
How are you?

47:44.777 --> 47:48.347
Did you manage to find a
bride, not a witch, eh?

47:48.380 --> 47:51.150
To hell with the brides.
Please take me to the hotel.

47:52.284 --> 47:55.521
Yeah. Come on,
come on, come on.

47:58.557 --> 48:01.293
Yeah, that's it.

48:01.327 --> 48:04.731
You have to be careful,
my American buddy.

48:04.764 --> 48:06.500
You have to be careful.

48:11.436 --> 48:14.641
- Didn't anybody warn you, huh?
- About what?

48:18.210 --> 48:20.979
I understand you,
I do understand,

48:21.012 --> 48:23.449
I do understand you very well.

48:26.552 --> 48:28.655
That happens, that happens.

48:30.889 --> 48:32.525
What does she want from me?

48:33.726 --> 48:36.262
What does she want?
What does she want?

48:36.295 --> 48:41.300
She wants your balls, my American boy.
She wants your balls.

48:41.733 --> 48:43.001
If a witch

48:43.034 --> 48:44.670
makes a foreigner

48:46.038 --> 48:48.909
from every part of the world

48:52.244 --> 48:55.514
fall in love with her,

48:56.681 --> 48:59.685
cuts his balls and eats them,

49:01.853 --> 49:03.856
she becomes immortal,

49:04.856 --> 49:06.659
yeah.

49:06.692 --> 49:10.362
I understand, mate.

49:10.396 --> 49:11.598
When

49:11.630 --> 49:13.632
I imagine that...

49:24.277 --> 49:26.713
It makes me sweat.

49:31.449 --> 49:33.051
- She wants your balls.
- Okay, okay.

49:33.085 --> 49:34.954
For example, witch, my balls

49:34.987 --> 49:37.557
and what am I supposed
to do right now?

49:37.590 --> 49:39.492
Right, you're right.

49:39.525 --> 49:41.561
What should you do?

49:41.594 --> 49:46.499
You should remove the
malefice, my American boy.

49:47.333 --> 49:48.901
Yeah, the malefice.

49:48.934 --> 49:51.771
- I'm gonna help you, yes?
- Yes.

49:51.804 --> 49:53.440
- Please, please.
- Yeah.

50:03.949 --> 50:04.784
Fine.

50:13.726 --> 50:14.494
Come on.

50:14.527 --> 50:15.327
- Go?
- Go.

50:16.561 --> 50:19.065
- Go straight ahead.
- Thank you, sir.

50:19.097 --> 50:22.969
I don't know how to thank you
enough. Thank you very much.

50:23.001 --> 50:25.038
No thanks. No.

50:26.405 --> 50:29.509
You'll pay it back.

50:30.576 --> 50:33.012
Thank you. Okay,
okay, you got it.

50:34.512 --> 50:35.748
Right you are.

50:35.780 --> 50:37.549
Good luck.

50:37.583 --> 50:38.785
Good luck, American.

50:38.818 --> 50:39.819
- Go?
- Come on.

50:39.851 --> 50:40.686
- Go?
- Go.

50:40.719 --> 50:42.554
Thank you, thank you.

50:43.655 --> 50:44.824
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

51:52.090 --> 51:52.891
Yeah.

52:17.148 --> 52:18.483
Hello.

52:18.516 --> 52:20.485
If somebody put a spell on you,

52:20.518 --> 52:23.389
you did the right
thing coming to me.

52:24.956 --> 52:26.725
- Do you have cash?
- No.

52:27.893 --> 52:31.431
All right, you'll
transfer it to me later.

52:31.463 --> 52:32.097
Uh-huh.

52:32.130 --> 52:34.099
Come in, our guest.

52:48.012 --> 52:50.016
Your case isn't easy.

52:52.585 --> 52:55.121
It will cost you 10,000 rubles.

52:56.922 --> 53:00.693
But how do you know
what happened to me?

53:00.726 --> 53:03.463
I'm a fairy, I
know everything.

53:04.697 --> 53:06.199
Take your clothes off.

53:07.099 --> 53:07.934
Why?

53:09.300 --> 53:13.472
I will lift the witch's curse.

53:17.675 --> 53:20.980
Okay, as long as it
helps get away from Nina.

53:21.012 --> 53:24.250
Nina is a rare witch
but this will help.

53:25.985 --> 53:30.722
I will prepare everything
and you take your clothes off

53:32.690 --> 53:35.828
but make sure you
are completely naked.

53:38.230 --> 53:39.833
Why do I have to be naked?

53:44.235 --> 53:46.905
Otherwise, it might not work.

53:48.007 --> 53:48.842
Naked again.

54:18.771 --> 54:19.639
Don't worry.

54:20.706 --> 54:22.842
All my remedies are organic.

54:24.809 --> 54:28.715
Come on, get up and come closer.

54:32.751 --> 54:33.620
Turn your back to me

54:35.253 --> 54:36.855
and now bend over.

54:38.791 --> 54:40.527
- Are you serious?
- Absolutely.

54:41.393 --> 54:42.762
Don't stop now.

54:44.797 --> 54:46.164
Okay.

54:59.777 --> 55:01.046
Don't be afraid.

55:03.414 --> 55:04.317
Believe me.

55:12.757 --> 55:14.993
You'll never go away from me.

55:54.065 --> 55:56.335
Excuse me. Can
you help me please?

55:59.237 --> 56:02.407
I am picking mushrooms.

56:03.375 --> 56:05.644
And what are you doing here, eh?

56:07.211 --> 56:09.815
A smart witch has come for you.

56:11.382 --> 56:12.618
Fight for it.

56:17.255 --> 56:18.090
Shit.

56:19.324 --> 56:20.293
Shit.

57:22.887 --> 57:24.123
Can I help you with anything?

57:24.155 --> 57:25.523
Yes you can, please
call the police.

57:25.556 --> 57:27.492
Please, a crazy
woman is after me.

57:27.525 --> 57:30.962
It seems like you
had one too many.

57:30.996 --> 57:32.530
Maybe better to call a doctor.

57:32.563 --> 57:36.335
No, I'm dead serious. A
crazy woman is after me.

57:36.367 --> 57:37.369
All right.

57:38.503 --> 57:40.272
I understand what
you are talking about

57:41.873 --> 57:45.477
but not police, not
a doctor can help.

57:45.510 --> 57:46.778
Then who can?

57:50.516 --> 57:51.851
The red matrix stone.

57:52.918 --> 57:53.720
Huh?

57:56.088 --> 57:57.556
Are you kidding me?

57:57.588 --> 58:00.259
All these dark powers,
witches, it's all bullshit.

58:00.291 --> 58:02.460
It doesn't exist, just help me.

58:02.494 --> 58:06.432
Yes it does and you have
to know how to fight them.

58:10.369 --> 58:12.004
Okay, okay.

58:13.172 --> 58:15.474
How will it help me
and where do I get it?

58:15.507 --> 58:19.244
You need to go to the bath
house at midnight and take it.

58:20.411 --> 58:23.982
The owner of the stone
have extra power.

58:25.483 --> 58:26.918
Damn, Nina.

58:26.952 --> 58:29.488
Oh, her name is Nina?

58:29.521 --> 58:32.492
- Yes. I think.
- I know this

58:33.391 --> 58:34.292
witch.

58:34.326 --> 58:36.028
So what does she want from me?

58:37.329 --> 58:38.898
Immortality of course.

58:40.298 --> 58:43.067
I heard that if
she makes seven men

58:43.101 --> 58:46.204
from seven different countries
fall in love with her,

58:46.237 --> 58:50.442
cuts off their balls and
she will be immortal.

58:52.443 --> 58:53.278
Brilliant.

58:54.646 --> 58:56.516
I don't know what
to believe anymore.

58:58.217 --> 59:01.420
You don't have any
other choice, I'm afraid.

59:03.989 --> 59:05.490
How do you know
all that stuff?

59:05.523 --> 59:06.925
It happened before.

59:08.393 --> 59:09.295
Don't lose the time

59:10.295 --> 59:13.365
and when you take the
stone, don't lose it.

01:00:01.612 --> 01:00:04.149
You're
not the one to put it here,

01:00:05.449 --> 01:00:07.586
so you're not the
one to touch it.

01:00:09.420 --> 01:00:11.022
Who's here?

01:00:11.056 --> 01:00:13.860
Nobody's here. Just you.

01:00:15.626 --> 01:00:17.262
Just me?

01:00:17.295 --> 01:00:20.198
Just you and yourself.

01:00:22.467 --> 01:00:24.170
The voice sounds too familiar.

01:00:25.336 --> 01:00:26.639
I don't understand.

01:00:27.739 --> 01:00:29.175
Me neither.

01:00:35.547 --> 01:00:36.382
Who are you?

01:00:38.282 --> 01:00:40.318
I'm you and you're me.

01:00:40.351 --> 01:00:42.087
You're not me and I'm not you.

01:00:43.422 --> 01:00:45.224
Is that right?

01:00:45.257 --> 01:00:48.527
The looks, the voice, the face.

01:00:48.559 --> 01:00:51.195
Everything is the same.

01:00:51.228 --> 01:00:53.965
Looks like there's too
many doubles in this world.

01:00:56.268 --> 01:00:57.403
It hurts, mate.

01:00:58.637 --> 01:01:00.306
Screw you. I'm not your mate.

01:01:02.106 --> 01:01:03.675
This stone's really good.

01:02:01.800 --> 01:02:03.736
Bravo, handsome.

01:02:03.768 --> 01:02:05.203
You are really very strong.

01:02:08.206 --> 01:02:10.209
But we are wasting
too much time on you.

01:02:16.347 --> 01:02:17.315
Nice try.

01:03:09.534 --> 01:03:13.072
I told you, you won't
get away from me.

01:03:16.173 --> 01:03:19.510
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

01:03:19.543 --> 01:03:23.148
Tell me darling, how
do you like me best?

01:03:23.914 --> 01:03:25.050
Like this?

01:03:34.559 --> 01:03:35.661
Or like this?

01:03:40.398 --> 01:03:41.500
Or like this?

01:04:08.927 --> 01:04:09.862
Let's play.

01:04:15.266 --> 01:04:16.268
Goddammit.

01:04:24.509 --> 01:04:26.112
You're only mine.

01:05:00.711 --> 01:05:02.514
Eat my fricking balls, witch.

01:05:38.650 --> 01:05:41.720
It looks like
hallucination from strong fall.

01:05:42.853 --> 01:05:45.823
- Oh, it might help-
- Please take her away.

01:05:45.856 --> 01:05:47.226
Sorry.

01:05:47.259 --> 01:05:49.695
Gorgeous, give the man
some breathing room.

01:05:49.728 --> 01:05:50.628
Where am I?

01:05:51.963 --> 01:05:53.832
Did I fly back home?

01:05:53.864 --> 01:05:55.333
Not exactly, mate.

01:05:55.367 --> 01:05:58.604
You've definitely been
on a bit of a trip.

01:06:01.273 --> 01:06:02.874
Didn't I fly away?

01:06:02.907 --> 01:06:04.675
Mate, you're in
your apartment.

01:06:04.708 --> 01:06:06.844
Look around, you're
in your lounge.

01:06:06.878 --> 01:06:09.414
I mean, a bit of a
knock on the head.

01:06:11.715 --> 01:06:14.385
Honestly, you had a
concussion but I think

01:06:14.418 --> 01:06:17.556
with a few days rest on here,
you'll be back to normal.

01:06:28.565 --> 01:06:30.635
But I saw her in the hotel.

01:06:30.668 --> 01:06:33.038
You need to have some rest.

01:06:33.070 --> 01:06:34.940
All will be fine.

01:06:34.972 --> 01:06:37.842
Tony, honestly mate,
you're in great hands.

01:06:37.876 --> 01:06:39.978
Look at the doctor.

01:06:40.010 --> 01:06:41.679
Look at Gloria.

01:06:41.713 --> 01:06:42.948
She's here all night.

01:06:42.981 --> 01:06:44.783
She said she'll look
after you until tomorrow.

01:06:44.815 --> 01:06:47.485
She's from the private
clinic down the road.

01:06:47.518 --> 01:06:49.420
Mate, how lucky are you?

01:06:50.989 --> 01:06:52.423
So.

01:06:52.456 --> 01:06:53.759
Rest up.

01:06:53.791 --> 01:06:54.994
- See you, doctor.
- See you.

01:06:57.061 --> 01:07:00.065
Maybe just a little
knock next time, mate.

01:07:00.097 --> 01:07:02.634
Honestly dude, I hope
you're all right.

01:07:02.666 --> 01:07:04.603
Feel better soon, yeah?

01:07:04.635 --> 01:07:06.605
- Okay. Ready, darling?
- Mm hmm.

01:07:29.661 --> 01:07:32.898
Gloria, could you please
bring me a glass of water?

01:07:32.931 --> 01:07:33.766
Sure.

01:07:35.367 --> 01:07:38.470
I will bring you
much more than that.

01:07:39.771 --> 01:07:40.606
Nina?

01:07:43.173 --> 01:07:46.311
I told you you're not
getting away from me.

01:07:50.681 --> 01:07:51.817
It seems like it's better

01:07:51.849 --> 01:07:53.585
to look for a bride
in your own country.

01:11:26.229 --> 01:11:27.131
I'm fine!

01:11:30.368 --> 01:11:31.603
So beautiful.

01:11:33.770 --> 01:11:34.672
Oh my life,

01:11:35.974 --> 01:11:37.009
so beautiful.

01:11:39.266 --> 01:11:44.266
