WEBVTT

00:03.046 --> 00:04.439
I'm the senior FBI
special agent in the country.

00:04.526 --> 00:07.268
The team you run,
they are sloppy, undisciplined.

00:07.355 --> 00:10.097
I blame you, their leader.

00:10.184 --> 00:12.099
Dandridge planted McKenna
here for his eyes and ears.

00:12.186 --> 00:13.926
Why are you here?

00:14.014 --> 00:15.711
I'm here to learn.

00:15.798 --> 00:17.669
You're being transferred to
the admin division in Alabama.

00:17.756 --> 00:20.063
You have no power
to relocate me.

00:20.150 --> 00:22.500
This is going to get
acrimonious very quickly.

00:22.587 --> 00:24.024
Let it.

00:24.111 --> 00:25.634
I'm not going without a fight.

00:29.203 --> 00:30.595
Let me tell you a story

00:30.682 --> 00:32.336
about how to completely
screw up your career.

00:32.423 --> 00:33.990
My dad owned
an office building.

00:34.077 --> 00:35.948
We grew up on the second floor.

00:36.036 --> 00:38.212
Bottom one,
he leased to Larry Beaumont.

00:38.299 --> 00:39.778
Hardware store owner.

00:39.865 --> 00:42.781
One day, Ace shows up--

00:42.868 --> 00:45.697
multi-million dollar
big-box hardware company.

00:45.784 --> 00:46.959
They want to buy the building.

00:47.047 --> 00:50.615
So Dad comes home
with a moral dilemma.

00:50.702 --> 00:53.618
Does he put a friend out
on the street for a payday?

00:53.705 --> 00:56.012
My mom says,
"Follow your heart,"

00:56.099 --> 00:58.536
so he tells Ace to pound sand.

00:58.623 --> 01:00.538
Ace buys a different building
three blocks away.

01:00.625 --> 01:03.019
Within six months,
Larry's customers are shopping

01:03.106 --> 01:05.717
down the street, and he can't
whip up the money to pay rent.

01:05.804 --> 01:08.938
So I ask you,
what was my father's mistake?

01:11.027 --> 01:12.855
Loyalty is a fool's virtue.

01:15.249 --> 01:18.252
Scott Forrester will be in
Alabama by the end of the week.

01:20.906 --> 01:22.778
You wanna stay loyal to him?

01:22.865 --> 01:24.258
Follow him out the door.

01:47.063 --> 01:49.326
I--I was kidnapped.

01:54.070 --> 01:56.812
Look, can you please,
please, just call my mom?

01:56.899 --> 01:58.335
My mom.

01:59.641 --> 02:01.599
English no good.

02:02.905 --> 02:05.995
Please help me.

02:07.910 --> 02:09.738
No, no, no.

02:12.175 --> 02:13.959
No, no, no.

02:37.418 --> 02:38.549
Hello?

03:05.924 --> 03:08.536
Morning.

03:08.623 --> 03:09.798
Hey.

03:09.885 --> 03:11.408
We need to talk.

03:21.375 --> 03:24.160
By the end of the week.
He was very clear.

03:25.944 --> 03:26.989
OK.

03:27.076 --> 03:28.382
That's it?

03:28.469 --> 03:30.471
- I'm pushing back.
- When? How?

03:30.558 --> 03:32.386
Because he's pretty sure
the battle's over.

03:32.473 --> 03:34.649
I am doing
everything that I can,

03:34.736 --> 03:37.826
calling in every chit that
anyone owes me, all right?

03:37.913 --> 03:40.002
I'm not giving up until
the door is shut in my face.

03:40.089 --> 03:41.308
All right?
- Hey.

03:41.395 --> 03:42.918
Caught a case.

03:43.005 --> 03:44.746
One sec.

03:46.748 --> 03:48.619
Should we still include her
in our work?

03:48.706 --> 03:50.186
She was assigned
to this task force.

03:50.273 --> 03:51.883
She's Dandridge's number two.

03:51.970 --> 03:54.103
McKenna's a solid agent.
She keeps her head down.

03:54.190 --> 03:55.626
She has given me no reason
to doubt her.

03:55.713 --> 03:57.498
Come on.

03:57.585 --> 03:58.847
Let's see what she's got.

04:00.196 --> 04:01.589
Go.

04:01.676 --> 04:02.938
Katie Marsh.

04:03.025 --> 04:04.548
Disappeared from her home
in Minnesota

04:04.635 --> 04:07.377
in broad daylight in 2012.
- I remember that case.

04:07.464 --> 04:09.727
My mom was glued to the TV
for a solid month and a half.

04:09.814 --> 04:12.208
A distressed teenager showed
up in Ganserndorf, Austria,

04:12.295 --> 04:14.689
claiming to be Katie,
asking for help in English.

04:14.776 --> 04:16.343
Disappeared
before police arrived.

04:16.430 --> 04:17.648
D.C. sent this in:

04:17.735 --> 04:19.389
an aged-up Katie
based on childhood photos.

04:19.476 --> 04:20.956
Looks just like her.

04:21.043 --> 04:22.610
Yeah, but we need more proof.

04:22.697 --> 04:24.612
No one wants a repeat
of Nicholas Barclay.

04:24.699 --> 04:25.743
Who?

04:25.830 --> 04:29.051
San Antonio, Texas, 1994.

04:29.138 --> 04:31.183
13-year-old Nicholas
goes to play basketball

04:31.271 --> 04:33.534
with some friends.
He never comes home.

04:33.621 --> 04:35.971
Three years later,
a teenager shows up in Spain.

04:36.058 --> 04:37.102
Claims to be Nicholas.

04:37.189 --> 04:38.930
The family is overjoyed.

04:39.017 --> 04:40.671
Six months later,
a P.I. comes forward,

04:40.758 --> 04:42.282
says he has his doubts,
wants to run some DNA.

04:42.369 --> 04:43.718
A con man?

04:43.805 --> 04:45.763
A serial imposter
named Frédéric Bourdin.

04:45.850 --> 04:47.112
Sickening.

04:47.199 --> 04:48.679
OK, let's head to Austria,

04:48.766 --> 04:50.246
see if we can get a track
on this girl.

04:50.333 --> 04:51.856
If it is Katie Marsh,

04:51.943 --> 04:53.510
a whole lot of people are
gonna want to know about it.

04:53.597 --> 04:55.033
I'll bring Smitty up
to speed.

04:55.120 --> 04:56.078
I'd like to assist.

04:58.080 --> 05:00.082
Uh, if that's OK with everyone.

05:01.388 --> 05:02.389
Yeah.

05:09.091 --> 05:10.310
Stadthauptmann
Liam Kaufmann.

05:10.397 --> 05:11.615
Special Agent
Scott Forrester.

05:11.702 --> 05:13.313
This is Megan Garretson
with Europol.

05:13.400 --> 05:15.010
Agents Vo, Kellet,
McKenna, and Raines.

05:15.097 --> 05:17.186
Nice to meet you.

05:17.273 --> 05:18.666
Here in Ganserndorf,

05:18.753 --> 05:20.276
my wife buys a ham
at the market today

05:20.363 --> 05:21.582
and pays for it next week.

05:21.669 --> 05:23.932
This isn't a town
where girls go missing.

05:24.019 --> 05:25.542
We are alarmed.

05:25.629 --> 05:27.501
We will offer support,
but with my staff

05:27.588 --> 05:29.677
only just returning
from holiday,

05:29.764 --> 05:31.679
we are not operating
at full capacity.

05:31.766 --> 05:34.986
We appreciate any cooperation
you can give us.

05:35.073 --> 05:37.162
Do you wish to speak
to your colleague?

05:37.249 --> 05:38.468
Who?

05:38.555 --> 05:39.730
The detective.

05:39.817 --> 05:42.298
I believe his name is Saunders.

05:44.256 --> 05:45.910
Forensics report
just came in.

05:45.997 --> 05:47.303
Vo and I will take a look.

05:48.696 --> 05:50.306
- Lead the way.
- Yes.

05:53.614 --> 05:55.180
Keith Saunders,
Minneapolis PD.

05:55.267 --> 05:56.878
Megan Garretson, Europol.

05:56.965 --> 05:59.141
Scott Forrester,
Jamie Kellett, FBI.

05:59.228 --> 06:00.621
We weren't expecting you, Detective.

06:00.708 --> 06:02.666
Well, I was part
of the 2012 investigation.

06:02.753 --> 06:03.972
You know Agent Manuel
out of St. Paul?

06:04.059 --> 06:05.800
I worked with him

06:05.887 --> 06:07.236
through the PD's
missing persons task force.

06:07.323 --> 06:08.846
He left me on the Marsh case

06:08.933 --> 06:11.066
as the point of contact
within the PD.

06:11.153 --> 06:12.894
Well, we appreciate you
flying all this way,

06:12.981 --> 06:14.199
but no one told us
you were coming.

06:14.286 --> 06:16.158
Yeah, well, I'm here.

06:16.245 --> 06:18.029
And here's how I can help.

06:18.116 --> 06:21.250
She left this in the store.

06:21.337 --> 06:25.341
Now, this is Katie
ages six and eight.

06:25.428 --> 06:28.779
- It's the same ring.
- Exactly.

06:28.866 --> 06:31.347
They found traces
of phenobarbital on that ring.

06:31.434 --> 06:34.045
Explains her wooziness
in the store video.

06:34.132 --> 06:36.178
They also found DNA on it. Saliva.

06:36.265 --> 06:37.788
It's a match for Katie Marsh.

06:37.875 --> 06:39.442
Oh, my God.

06:39.529 --> 06:40.617
It's clever to lick the ring

06:40.704 --> 06:42.227
to make sure
we knew it was her.

06:42.314 --> 06:43.577
OK, we have a match.

06:43.664 --> 06:45.579
Clock is ticking
before this becomes

06:45.666 --> 06:47.232
the biggest news story
in the world.

06:47.319 --> 06:49.452
Detective, I know you know
we need absolute discretion

06:49.539 --> 06:50.932
in the short window
that we have.

06:51.019 --> 06:52.237
Raines, Vo, can you see
what they have

06:52.324 --> 06:54.283
for security cameras or CCTV?

06:54.370 --> 06:56.241
I'll head to the convenience
store with Smitty.

06:56.328 --> 06:59.375
Uh, what can I be doing?

06:59.462 --> 07:01.072
Can you get me everything
that you've collected

07:01.159 --> 07:02.030
since she originally
went missing?

07:02.117 --> 07:03.684
Of course, yes.

07:06.730 --> 07:08.819
Can you look
into Detective Saunders?

07:08.906 --> 07:11.605
He seems a little twitchy.
- Read my mind.

07:15.826 --> 07:17.611
"The American was unwell.

07:17.698 --> 07:19.264
"She kept looking
over her shoulder

07:19.351 --> 07:21.397
as if she were waiting
for someone."

07:21.484 --> 07:24.269
Did you see anyone: a car,
another person outside?

07:32.495 --> 07:34.845
I saw a gray van drive away,

07:34.932 --> 07:37.369
but I couldn't get
the license plate.

07:43.941 --> 07:45.987
What did she say?

07:46.074 --> 07:48.642
She says
she hopes you find the girl

07:48.729 --> 07:51.209
before the Krampus does.

07:51.296 --> 07:53.647
A monster mothers used
to tell their children

07:53.734 --> 07:55.213
to keep them
from straying too far.

07:57.781 --> 07:58.652
<i>Danke schon.</i>

08:05.920 --> 08:07.748
Out with it.

08:07.835 --> 08:09.358
You won't like it.

08:09.445 --> 08:11.186
When has that
ever stopped you?

08:11.273 --> 08:13.580
You need to have a plan, Scott.

08:13.667 --> 08:15.669
Don't feed me this bunk about
how you're biding your time.

08:15.756 --> 08:17.714
Uh-huh.

08:17.801 --> 08:19.150
Victor Peeters.

08:19.237 --> 08:21.326
- What about him?
- Trojan shield.

08:21.413 --> 08:22.719
He was the first to fold.

08:22.806 --> 08:24.547
After he caved,
800 arrests.

08:24.634 --> 08:28.159
But again and again,
what did you ask me?

08:28.246 --> 08:29.900
"When?"

08:29.987 --> 08:31.902
Never mind that our evidence
was circumstantial,

08:31.989 --> 08:33.295
but you were ready to move.

08:33.382 --> 08:34.514
But what did we do?

08:34.601 --> 08:35.819
We slowly
turned up the pressure,

08:35.906 --> 08:37.255
and Peeters did himself in.

08:37.342 --> 08:38.735
This isn't
some sting operation

08:38.822 --> 08:39.736
where you can wait it out.

08:39.823 --> 08:41.564
This is your career, Scott.

08:41.651 --> 08:44.175
You're asking me when.

08:44.262 --> 08:46.308
All I'm saying is,

08:46.395 --> 08:48.658
not yet.

08:52.793 --> 08:54.011
They're still
running StarTraq,

08:54.098 --> 08:56.448
old software circa 2005.

08:56.536 --> 08:58.276
No surveillance,
no cached recordings.

08:58.363 --> 08:59.713
Well, if Katie's abductor
wanted to get the hell

08:59.800 --> 09:01.236
out of dodge,
maybe he ran a red.

09:01.323 --> 09:03.064
Check for any violations
within our timeframe.

09:12.290 --> 09:13.944
Clinic records
have that ambulance

09:14.031 --> 09:17.121
headed to Hotel Karin--
a motel, I guess.

09:17.208 --> 09:18.993
15 minute walk
from the convenience store.

09:19.080 --> 09:21.909
Is there information
on what the emergency was?

09:21.996 --> 09:23.345
OK, you and Vo
check out the clinic.

09:23.432 --> 09:24.694
See if there's a connection

09:24.781 --> 09:26.348
between missing girl,
convenience store,

09:26.435 --> 09:29.786
and emergency at a motel
in the same area.

09:29.873 --> 09:32.441
I checked with Minneapolis PD
about Detective Saunders.

09:32.528 --> 09:33.921
Yeah?

09:34.008 --> 09:34.661
You're not
gonna believe this.

09:41.450 --> 09:42.451
You guys ready
for my presentation?

09:42.538 --> 09:44.279
Actually, I just found out

09:44.366 --> 09:46.020
you were pulled
off Katie's case

09:46.107 --> 09:48.849
and fired by Minneapolis PD
for misconduct.

09:48.936 --> 09:50.241
That's--

09:50.328 --> 09:51.591
You haven't been a detective
in years,

09:51.678 --> 09:53.854
have you?

09:56.204 --> 09:58.075
We spoke
with Lieutenant Daniels,

09:58.162 --> 09:59.511
your former supervisor.

09:59.599 --> 10:02.166
Said you were a head case.
Fired with cause.

10:02.253 --> 10:03.820
Yeah, well...

10:05.953 --> 10:08.999
Look, Daniels believed Katie
was abducted by a home invader

10:09.086 --> 10:11.436
they caught a month
after the kidnapping.

10:11.523 --> 10:12.916
But the guy never confessed

10:13.003 --> 10:14.962
and Daniels
could never prove he did it.

10:15.049 --> 10:17.965
My theory, which I was
about to present to you:

10:18.052 --> 10:20.924
Katie was taken
by someone she knew.

10:21.011 --> 10:23.884
Her backpack was missing
and some of her favorite toys--

10:23.971 --> 10:27.104
a teddy bear, blue,
with a bell around its neck.

10:27.191 --> 10:30.978
Why would a home invader give
Katie time to pack a go bag?

10:31.065 --> 10:32.588
My theory clashed
with Daniels' theory.

10:32.675 --> 10:34.198
That's it.
Guess who lost?

10:34.285 --> 10:35.852
We're not interested
in the station politics

10:35.939 --> 10:37.375
that you got tangled up in.
- Oh, come on, man.

10:37.462 --> 10:39.334
Neither was I.
That's why I'm here.

10:39.421 --> 10:40.988
You are not a part
of this investigation.

10:41.075 --> 10:42.816
I am the only one
who gave a damn!

10:42.903 --> 10:45.296
I lost my job,

10:45.383 --> 10:47.951
my pension, respect,

10:48.038 --> 10:49.431
but I never stopped.

10:51.738 --> 10:53.696
This case is my life.

11:03.358 --> 11:04.620
Are you sure?

11:04.707 --> 11:06.491
Public records confirmed it.

11:08.058 --> 11:10.539
Is there anything else
you want to tell us?

11:13.455 --> 11:18.286
He and Katie Marsh's mom
are married.

11:18.373 --> 11:20.767
I'm not hiding it.

11:20.854 --> 11:24.945
Does your wife know
that you're here?

11:25.032 --> 11:27.251
Does she know that we have
a fix on her daughter?

11:27.338 --> 11:29.950
Come on, man.

11:30.037 --> 11:33.910
There is a protocol to when
and how you involve the family.

11:33.997 --> 11:35.390
All right, all right.

11:37.392 --> 11:40.221
Allison is here too.

11:40.308 --> 11:41.875
We flew out together.

11:50.187 --> 11:52.886
At first,
Gary, Katy's dad, and I

11:52.973 --> 11:54.278
looked for her
night and day,

11:54.365 --> 11:56.280
but after a year,
the leads dried up.

11:56.367 --> 11:57.978
He just--

11:58.065 --> 11:59.936
he gave up.

12:00.023 --> 12:01.155
That's the only way
to describe it.

12:01.242 --> 12:03.679
He just shut Katie out
of his mind

12:03.766 --> 12:06.943
like he was
pulling down a divider.

12:07.030 --> 12:08.292
Everyone
processes grief diff--

12:08.379 --> 12:11.121
He wanted
to have another kid,

12:11.208 --> 12:13.950
like she was a broken toy
we could replace.

12:16.431 --> 12:19.347
We need to ask you about
your current husband, Keith.

12:19.434 --> 12:21.088
OK.

12:21.175 --> 12:22.872
Normally, a detective
is taken off a case

12:22.959 --> 12:26.310
if his or her involvement
becomes too personal.

12:26.397 --> 12:28.486
It's a fireable offense
in most police departments.

12:28.573 --> 12:29.749
Keith and I
didn't get together

12:29.836 --> 12:31.402
until after he was let go.

12:31.489 --> 12:33.274
Any resentment
from your ex-husband

12:33.361 --> 12:35.406
when you two started dating?

12:35.493 --> 12:38.148
Gary had already remarried.

12:38.235 --> 12:41.325
He gave up on Katie and me
a long time ago.

12:41.412 --> 12:45.199
Please, Keith only wants
to find my daughter.

12:45.286 --> 12:48.289
Same as you, same as me.

12:48.376 --> 12:49.986
Let us help you.

12:52.772 --> 12:55.818
We'll be in touch
when we have more.

12:57.864 --> 12:59.169
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

13:01.302 --> 13:02.738
You could hear it
in her voice.

13:02.825 --> 13:04.261
None of that was a lie.

13:04.348 --> 13:06.873
I agree.

13:12.487 --> 13:14.837
<i>Danke.</i>

13:14.924 --> 13:16.621
Remember that bet we made,

13:16.708 --> 13:18.928
that I'd be the first
female director of the FBI?

13:19.015 --> 13:22.149
But only after my term
as the first Black director.

13:22.236 --> 13:25.195
Well, I've gotta add another
ten years to that timeline.

13:25.282 --> 13:27.328
I mean, all this craziness
with Forrester?

13:27.415 --> 13:29.286
Don't count him out yet.

13:29.373 --> 13:31.158
Well, if things go south--

13:31.245 --> 13:32.550
if--

13:32.637 --> 13:34.248
what's your move?

13:34.335 --> 13:36.163
Even punching in 302s
till I'm grey

13:36.250 --> 13:37.468
sounds a hell of a lot better

13:37.555 --> 13:40.558
than saying "yes, Dandridge"
on repeat.

13:40.645 --> 13:42.125
Agreed.

13:42.212 --> 13:44.475
Emil Hochberg,
emergency responder.

13:44.562 --> 13:45.868
36 hour shift.

13:45.955 --> 13:47.435
Thanks for talking with us.

13:47.522 --> 13:50.177
This morning, you responded
to a call at Hotel Karin.

13:50.264 --> 13:52.222
Who was the patient?
- A girl.

13:52.309 --> 13:54.877
Um, severely malnourished
and dehydrated.

13:54.964 --> 13:56.923
Who called in the emergency?

13:57.010 --> 13:58.533
Her father.

13:58.620 --> 14:01.579
They'd been hiking
the Sultans Trail for two days

14:01.666 --> 14:02.798
when the child fell ill.

14:02.885 --> 14:03.930
I can send you my report.

14:04.017 --> 14:05.801
What was her name?

14:05.888 --> 14:09.500
To be perfectly frank,
it was an odd situation.

14:09.587 --> 14:11.546
The name I was given
was Ilse Aichinger,

14:11.633 --> 14:14.331
but the girl's father
never called her "Ilse."

14:14.418 --> 14:16.246
The whole time,
he only called her "girl."

14:16.333 --> 14:19.554
Turns out, Ilse Aichinger
is an Austrian writer.

14:19.641 --> 14:22.339
I didn't realize it at the
time, but I looked it up later.

14:22.426 --> 14:24.907
Did the father mention
where they were headed?

14:24.994 --> 14:28.693
Mm, no, and actually,
I didn't see any luggage.

14:28.780 --> 14:31.000
I recommended we take the girl
to a hospital for supervision,

14:31.087 --> 14:33.437
but her father refused.

14:33.524 --> 14:37.006
Here in Austria, we cannot
override parental consent.

14:37.093 --> 14:40.488
All of this wasn't enough
to call the authorities?

14:40.575 --> 14:41.837
Did something happen
to the girl?

14:41.924 --> 14:44.013
Answer the question.

14:44.100 --> 14:46.320
I've been
working 36-hour shifts,

14:46.407 --> 14:48.365
one day off every ten days
since November.

14:48.452 --> 14:51.542
If anything happened
to the girl,

14:51.629 --> 14:52.543
I am sorry.

14:52.630 --> 14:53.631
Is this her?

14:56.634 --> 14:58.941
The girl I treated was
only six or seven years old.

14:59.028 --> 15:00.160
You sure?

15:00.247 --> 15:01.944
Yeah, sure.

15:09.386 --> 15:10.866
Yes, I see it here.

15:10.953 --> 15:12.824
Aichinger.

15:12.912 --> 15:15.523
You didn't ask for ID?

15:15.610 --> 15:17.786
It's EU policy
for hotel guests to provide ID.

15:17.873 --> 15:19.570
Not when they pay
by the hour.

15:20.963 --> 15:22.138
No cameras?

15:22.225 --> 15:24.271
Does this look like
the Four Seasons?

15:29.276 --> 15:31.626
- Is that your car?
- Mm-hmm.

15:31.713 --> 15:33.193
I can see a dash cam
from here.

15:33.280 --> 15:35.412
Oh, correct.
For YouTube, yes?

15:35.499 --> 15:37.327
With crash videos
you can get a lot of views.

15:37.414 --> 15:39.373
- You always park in that spot?
- Yes.

15:39.460 --> 15:41.331
- And it's always on?
- I don't--

15:41.418 --> 15:42.376
Can I take a look
at your laptop?

15:55.084 --> 15:56.520
That's it.

15:56.607 --> 15:58.218
It's Katie.

15:58.305 --> 15:59.871
There's a second victim.

15:59.959 --> 16:01.830
She needed a medic,

16:01.917 --> 16:03.353
but he didn't want to get
wrapped up in hospital red tape

16:03.440 --> 16:05.573
or give up his home address.

16:05.660 --> 16:08.793
Made up a bogus story
about how they'd been hiking.

16:08.880 --> 16:10.360
Timestamp's pretty close

16:10.447 --> 16:11.971
to when Katie showed up
at the store.

16:12.058 --> 16:13.363
Abductor had his hands full.

16:13.450 --> 16:14.930
Katie saw her window,
and she went for it.

16:15.017 --> 16:16.540
So who's our second victim?

16:21.632 --> 16:23.373
OK, no luck
on our second victim so far,

16:23.460 --> 16:25.245
but I crosschecked
the man's face

16:25.332 --> 16:27.421
with Minneapolis PD's
arrest records

16:27.508 --> 16:29.031
back at the time
of Katie's abduction.

16:29.118 --> 16:31.947
Closest match was
for an Otto Lang.

16:32.034 --> 16:33.557
Arrested in Bethel, Minnesota,

16:33.644 --> 16:36.908
for solicitation of an
underaged prostitute in 2011.

16:36.996 --> 16:38.345
Served six months.

16:38.432 --> 16:39.650
He's an American.

16:39.737 --> 16:41.696
Dual citizenship.
Born in Austria.

16:41.783 --> 16:43.959
Got an address for him
right here in Millstatt.

16:44.046 --> 16:45.134
- It's him.
- OK.

16:45.221 --> 16:46.788
I want a complete workup
on Lang.

16:46.875 --> 16:49.660
Work history, credit history,
ten-print card.

16:49.747 --> 16:51.706
Ask Saunders if he was
on their radar back in 2012.

16:51.793 --> 16:54.013
Do I loop her in?

16:56.798 --> 16:58.147
Not yet.

16:58.234 --> 16:59.670
Raines, we've got a suspect.

16:59.757 --> 17:03.109
I'm gonna send you the address.
You and Vo meet us there.

17:34.183 --> 17:35.489
Clear.

18:24.277 --> 18:26.279
Smitty.

18:26.366 --> 18:27.671
You see this?

18:31.327 --> 18:32.459
Ready?

18:47.778 --> 18:48.823
Damn.

18:50.390 --> 18:52.392
Lang's our guy.

18:52.479 --> 18:54.481
He must have just rolled out.

18:54.568 --> 18:55.438
How did he know
we were coming?

19:00.182 --> 19:01.183
What?

19:05.187 --> 19:08.408
<i>Assured, the FBI is working
with Austrian Special Police</i>

19:08.495 --> 19:12.151
<i>to find Otto Lang
and bring Katie Marsh home.</i>

19:12.238 --> 19:13.543
<i>To the mothers...</i>
- McKenna called in her boss

19:13.630 --> 19:15.502
so that
he could take the glory.

19:15.589 --> 19:18.853
And put our whole case
in jeopardy.

19:18.940 --> 19:20.420
<i>If you have any information</i>

19:20.507 --> 19:22.117
<i>on Otto Lang
or Katie Marsh's whereabouts,</i>

19:22.204 --> 19:23.684
<i>please call the number
listed below.</i>

19:23.771 --> 19:25.773
Call Chief Kaufmann.
I want this area blanketed.

19:25.860 --> 19:27.470
Vehicle checkpoints,
rolling surveillance,

19:27.557 --> 19:28.558
neighborhood
door-to-door canvassing.

19:28.645 --> 19:29.820
And make sure someone is up

19:29.907 --> 19:31.561
geolocating Lang's phone
when it goes hot.

19:31.648 --> 19:32.823
I will deal with Dandridge.

19:39.134 --> 19:40.744
Hey.

19:40.831 --> 19:42.442
You told him we had a suspect?

19:42.529 --> 19:44.922
No. No, I didn't know
he was coming.

19:45.009 --> 19:46.489
We had Lang!

19:46.576 --> 19:47.969
If you had waited an hour--

19:48.056 --> 19:49.579
hell,
if you had waited 20 minutes

19:49.666 --> 19:50.928
to give
your little showboat speech,

19:51.015 --> 19:53.540
Katie Marsh might be in
this police station right now.

19:53.627 --> 19:55.455
Standard protocol
for a missing child

19:55.542 --> 19:58.109
is releasing a BOLO
the moment we have information.

19:58.197 --> 20:00.242
I put Katie and Lang's faces
on the morning news,

20:00.329 --> 20:01.374
the night news,
every social media--

20:01.461 --> 20:03.158
Senator Preuitt
from Minnesota

20:03.245 --> 20:05.247
and Deputy Director Van Leer
want to speak with both of you.

20:05.334 --> 20:06.640
Now.

20:13.821 --> 20:15.692
<i>Special Agents Forrester
and Dandridge,</i>

20:15.779 --> 20:17.694
<i>this is Senator Preuitt, Minnesota.</i>

20:17.781 --> 20:19.348
<i>Morning, gentlemen.</i>

20:19.435 --> 20:21.263
<i>The senator sits
on the judiciary committee,</i>

20:21.350 --> 20:23.787
<i>but her involvement here
is personal.</i>

20:23.874 --> 20:27.878
<i>She worked in the Minneapolis
DA's office in 2012.</i>

20:27.965 --> 20:30.054
<i>Special Agent Forrester,
what's our status?</i>

20:30.141 --> 20:31.969
We have identified
Katie's abductor.

20:32.056 --> 20:34.145
Austrian police are conducting
a sweep of his neighborhood,

20:34.233 --> 20:35.408
including
door-to-door canvassing

20:35.495 --> 20:37.497
and roadblocks
at all choke points.

20:37.584 --> 20:38.846
<i>And Special Agent Dandridge,</i>

20:38.933 --> 20:41.718
<i>I understand you are
taking over the fly team.</i>

20:41.805 --> 20:43.720
- Correct.
<i>- Good.</i>

20:43.807 --> 20:46.593
<i>What your words meant
to my constituents,</i>

20:46.680 --> 20:50.074
<i>the thousands of search party
volunteers we had back then,</i>

20:50.161 --> 20:52.294
<i>each and every one of them
was so comforted</i>

20:52.381 --> 20:54.775
<i>by your transparency.</i>

20:54.862 --> 20:57.038
<i>I want to commend you,
Special Agent.</i>

20:57.125 --> 20:58.431
Well, I know
how important it is

20:58.518 --> 21:00.346
for the bureau
to keep the public informed.

21:00.433 --> 21:03.131
<i>I want a daily Sitrep
on case progress.</i>

21:03.218 --> 21:05.351
<i>Bring this girl home.</i>

21:05.438 --> 21:06.656
<i>Dismissed.</i>

21:19.930 --> 21:22.890
Our second victim,
Clara Brenner from Spannberg,

21:22.977 --> 21:24.370
town 15 miles west of here.

21:24.457 --> 21:25.545
Good work.

21:29.070 --> 21:31.725
They're here
to ID some items in the attic,

21:31.812 --> 21:33.596
see if they recognize anything
as Katie's.

21:33.683 --> 21:36.164
Maybe she left us
another clever message.

21:36.251 --> 21:37.557
OK.

21:37.644 --> 21:39.689
Mrs. Saunders?
Come with me.

21:48.437 --> 21:50.526
I want you
to be honest with me, Keith,

21:50.613 --> 21:52.006
because, no offense,
we didn't get started off

21:52.093 --> 21:54.182
on the right foot.
- Yeah.

21:54.269 --> 21:56.097
No. Hey, look,
that's on me.

21:56.184 --> 21:58.055
And I appreciate you
including us now.

21:58.142 --> 22:00.754
Are you going around my back
to Special Agent Dandridge?

22:00.841 --> 22:02.712
- The guy on TV?
- Mm-hmm.

22:02.799 --> 22:04.323
I never saw him
before this afternoon.

22:04.410 --> 22:07.978
There were six people present
when we ID'd Katie,

22:08.065 --> 22:10.633
and I know without a doubt
that I can trust five of them.

22:10.720 --> 22:12.156
Guys like Dandridge
are the reason

22:12.243 --> 22:14.289
I turned my badge in, OK?

22:14.376 --> 22:15.464
He doesn't care about Katie.

22:15.551 --> 22:17.292
He cares
that the TV cameras are on.

22:17.379 --> 22:18.424
Not my kind of cop.

22:20.208 --> 22:21.557
Look in my eyes.

22:21.644 --> 22:24.038
You got a rat?
It ain't me.

22:26.823 --> 22:28.085
OK.

22:31.001 --> 22:32.960
Makers Craft Fair.

22:33.047 --> 22:35.310
St. Paul, 2011.

22:35.397 --> 22:37.573
Six months before it happened.

22:37.660 --> 22:39.967
There was a ring toss.

22:40.054 --> 22:41.011
I won this.

22:42.665 --> 22:44.101
Never won anything before
in my life.

22:46.147 --> 22:49.629
I gave it to Katie.

22:55.809 --> 22:57.332
Mm, this, I don't recognize.

23:06.602 --> 23:09.431
This man, Lang,
he stole her childhood.

23:12.913 --> 23:16.307
It's good that he didn't
lock her up here 24/7, right?

23:18.745 --> 23:20.007
Do you think he...

23:22.052 --> 23:23.967
Do you think he abused her?

23:24.054 --> 23:27.406
I don't want to give you an
answer because we don't know.

23:29.495 --> 23:31.410
But when we find her,

23:31.497 --> 23:33.977
and we will find her,

23:34.064 --> 23:36.284
I want you to give her
all the love, support,

23:36.371 --> 23:39.853
and counseling she'll need,
no matter what she endured.

23:39.940 --> 23:41.115
Yes.

23:46.947 --> 23:51.299
Do you think she remembers me?

23:51.386 --> 23:55.434
At the convenience store,
you're the one she asked for.

23:55.521 --> 23:57.697
She knew
you'd never stop looking.

24:07.315 --> 24:08.795
Here's the full profile
on Otto Lang.

24:08.882 --> 24:10.710
Austrian citizenship
through his mother,

24:10.797 --> 24:12.276
American through his father.

24:12.363 --> 24:14.278
Dad left Austria
before Lang was born.

24:14.365 --> 24:16.846
Otto grew up here, but his mom
passed away when he was two.

24:16.933 --> 24:19.022
He was raised by his aunt,
Margarethe Lang.

24:19.109 --> 24:20.720
She was abusive.

24:20.807 --> 24:22.548
Police reports back
to Otto's childhood,

24:22.635 --> 24:24.071
but Margarethe
was never charged.

24:24.158 --> 24:26.595
Josef Fritzl, also Austrian.

24:26.682 --> 24:28.728
Abducted his own daughter
and locked her in the basement.

24:28.815 --> 24:30.207
His mother was abusive.

24:30.294 --> 24:31.818
Psychiatrists believe
that caused him

24:31.905 --> 24:33.994
to develop antisocial
personality disorder.

24:34.081 --> 24:35.865
Otto Lang was reclusive too.

24:35.952 --> 24:38.172
Now works six-month stints
driving trucks.

24:38.259 --> 24:41.088
Solitary work, night shifts. Fits.

24:41.175 --> 24:43.699
In 2012, Lang tried
to connect with his father.

24:43.786 --> 24:44.744
He was in the States for a year

24:44.831 --> 24:46.876
working
as an InterconExpress driver.

24:46.963 --> 24:48.225
Route ran
through Katie's neighborhood.

24:48.312 --> 24:50.837
He was watching her,
waiting for the perfect moment.

24:50.924 --> 24:53.535
Clara Brenner,
Lang's second victim.

24:53.622 --> 24:55.885
Five years old
when she was taken.

24:55.972 --> 24:57.496
We crosschecked
missing persons cases

24:57.583 --> 24:59.410
and confirmed she disappeared
two years ago.

24:59.498 --> 25:00.673
One day,
Clara walked to school.

25:00.760 --> 25:01.674
She never made it home.

25:01.761 --> 25:02.892
Any connection to Lang's M.O.

25:02.979 --> 25:04.198
with the delivery trucks?

25:04.285 --> 25:05.721
Lang was working
for a shipping depot

25:05.808 --> 25:07.288
whose warehouse was located
along Clara's path.

25:09.986 --> 25:13.033
Austria's track record with
abductions is spotty at best.

25:13.120 --> 25:14.687
I remember Clara Brenner.

25:14.774 --> 25:16.602
Have her parents been told
she's still alive?

25:16.689 --> 25:18.778
Her mum overdosed
shortly after.

25:18.865 --> 25:20.823
Single mum, suicide.

25:20.910 --> 25:22.651
Where are we
on Lang's vehicle?

25:22.738 --> 25:24.523
No hits yet,
but a BOLO's out and active.

25:24.610 --> 25:26.699
We've got real-time eyes on--
- Where are you going?

25:26.786 --> 25:28.788
To speak to Keith Saunders.
He chased Lang for a decade.

25:28.875 --> 25:30.485
He may have some insight
into his next move.

25:30.572 --> 25:32.400
Do you feel the most
worthwhile use of your time

25:32.487 --> 25:34.707
is interviewing
a failed detective?

25:34.794 --> 25:35.708
I do.

25:38.449 --> 25:41.540
We think the InterconExpress
truck is the key.

25:41.627 --> 25:44.325
You know, when Agent Kellett
showed me Lang's photo,

25:44.412 --> 25:46.414
I couldn't even place him.

25:46.501 --> 25:47.981
By the time we spoke to Lang,

25:48.068 --> 25:50.549
he'd been reassigned
to a route in Jersey.

25:50.636 --> 25:51.724
And he played it off like

25:51.811 --> 25:53.595
he barely even
remembered Katie.

25:55.597 --> 25:56.990
Well enough to convince me.

25:57.077 --> 25:58.818
- Hey, it's not your fault.
- Of course it is.

25:58.905 --> 26:01.690
I interviewed him,
and I let him walk.

26:01.777 --> 26:04.345
Sometimes your gut makes
a case, sometimes it doesn't.

26:04.432 --> 26:06.608
Every cop knows that.

26:06.695 --> 26:08.088
You've been looking for Lang
for years.

26:08.175 --> 26:10.177
You know him better
than anyone.

26:10.264 --> 26:11.918
Is there anything
that you can think of,

26:12.005 --> 26:14.703
no matter how insignificant,
that might help us?

26:14.790 --> 26:17.140
Look, the thing
I focused on in my career

26:17.227 --> 26:18.707
was pattern recognition, right?

26:18.794 --> 26:21.492
Study how perps think,
repeated behavior.

26:21.580 --> 26:23.886
But every time I thought
I had this guy pegged,

26:23.973 --> 26:25.279
I'd had it wrong.

26:25.366 --> 26:28.630
There wasn't a pattern.

26:28.717 --> 26:30.501
Maybe that's the pattern.

26:30.589 --> 26:32.329
What?

26:32.416 --> 26:33.635
Thank you.

26:36.986 --> 26:39.902
What if Lang isn't on the run?
What if he is waiting this out?

26:39.989 --> 26:41.774
I checked
if Lang owned any property

26:41.861 --> 26:43.384
besides the house in Millstatt.

26:43.471 --> 26:44.559
Search came up empty.

26:44.646 --> 26:45.865
<i>What about the aunt?</i>

26:45.952 --> 26:47.170
She's in hospice care
in Stuttgart.

26:47.257 --> 26:49.042
Nurses say
he's never visited her.

26:49.129 --> 26:51.087
<i>And the lakeside cabin
where Lang grew up</i>

26:51.174 --> 26:52.872
was repossessed
by the banks years ago.

26:52.959 --> 26:56.266
There is a pattern here
that isn't a pattern.

26:56.353 --> 26:57.528
I'm just not seeing it.

26:57.616 --> 26:59.052
Hey, got a hit
on Lang's vehicle.

26:59.139 --> 27:00.880
Dandridge wants you
to intercept.

27:00.967 --> 27:02.446
I gotta go, Scott.

27:02.533 --> 27:04.231
Go.

27:05.536 --> 27:07.408
Uh, Forrester pick up a lead?

27:07.495 --> 27:08.888
Anything I can help with?

27:08.975 --> 27:11.107
Dandridge asked you
to check in?

27:11.194 --> 27:14.197
Kellett, I swear
I didn't tell him anything.

27:14.284 --> 27:15.372
Sure.

27:28.603 --> 27:29.778
Hold on.

27:52.322 --> 27:54.281
Turn off the ignition.
Toss the keys out the window.

27:54.368 --> 27:56.979
Do it now!

27:57.066 --> 28:00.983
Exit your vehicle with
your hands above your head.

28:07.816 --> 28:09.426
Clear.

28:11.602 --> 28:12.691
Who the hell are you?

28:15.215 --> 28:16.607
Uh-huh.

28:16.695 --> 28:17.870
Where'd you get this vehicle?

28:17.957 --> 28:19.393
A man
at the Pizza Wurstl Standl

28:19.480 --> 28:21.351
gave me 1,000 euro
to exchange cars.

28:21.438 --> 28:22.744
He was traveling
with his daughters.

28:22.831 --> 28:24.311
- With two girls?
- Uh-huh.

28:24.398 --> 28:26.182
How long ago was this?

28:26.269 --> 28:29.055
- I-I don't know. I, um--
- 30 minutes, an hour? Think.

28:29.142 --> 28:31.884
Two, maybe.
<i>Drei, dreieinhalb Stunden?</i>

28:31.971 --> 28:34.538
Three and a half hours.

28:34.625 --> 28:38.151
I mean, Lang could be halfway
to Bratislava by now.

28:46.681 --> 28:48.465
A truck, Chevy.

28:51.555 --> 28:53.166
Beige. Year?

28:53.253 --> 28:54.689
Uh, '99, I think.

28:54.776 --> 28:57.692
No GPS.

28:57.779 --> 28:59.302
Record's clean.

28:59.389 --> 29:01.740
Did you leave any
personal items in your truck?

29:01.827 --> 29:04.177
Uh, no.
I don't think so.

29:04.264 --> 29:06.266
But my mom's sporttasche.

29:06.353 --> 29:07.963
Gym bag.

29:08.050 --> 29:09.225
Could she have left anything
in the bag,

29:09.312 --> 29:10.661
anything with a tracker?

29:10.749 --> 29:13.229
Her phone, an iPad,
a Tile keychain maybe?

29:13.316 --> 29:14.535
I don't know. I...

29:16.276 --> 29:19.496
I gave her a Fitbit
for Christmas.

29:21.150 --> 29:23.239
Raines, I need you
to get a location on a Fitbit.

29:23.326 --> 29:24.675
It's registered
under the name Altmann.

29:24.763 --> 29:27.287
- Lea.
- Lea Altmann.

29:29.680 --> 29:31.160
Found it.

29:45.348 --> 29:46.654
Hands up
where we can see them.

30:05.107 --> 30:07.066
It's clear.

30:10.983 --> 30:14.290
Kellett, check this out.

30:17.119 --> 30:19.252
There must have
been a struggle.

30:19.339 --> 30:21.645
If that's the girls' blood,
I swear to God...

30:21.732 --> 30:23.691
They should be close by.

30:23.778 --> 30:26.215
I'll have Austrian Special
Police get a search team going.

30:29.001 --> 30:30.306
If we can figure out

30:30.393 --> 30:33.005
exactly how Katie and Clara
were abducted,

30:33.092 --> 30:35.485
we can do the math
on where Lang's taking them.

30:35.572 --> 30:36.835
Well, Katie picked up
the mail every day.

30:36.922 --> 30:38.488
Lang must've coerced her
into his truck,

30:38.575 --> 30:40.490
hit her with the phenobarbital
to quiet her down.

30:40.577 --> 30:42.753
Lang's route took him
to the Duluth seaport.

30:42.841 --> 30:44.494
The day he took Katie
was the same day

30:44.581 --> 30:45.756
there was a big shipment
going out.

30:45.844 --> 30:47.367
He must've hid her in a crate.

30:47.454 --> 30:48.890
The mail depot
Clara would pass

30:48.977 --> 30:51.284
feeds right into
a rail cargo shipping yard.

30:51.371 --> 30:53.155
You're not gonna like this.

30:53.242 --> 30:55.375
Right here's
where we found the Chevy.

30:55.462 --> 30:58.117
There's a freight yard
a half a mile away.

30:58.204 --> 31:00.728
And the next train leaves in
30 minutes, headed to Morocco.

31:00.815 --> 31:02.556
No U.S. extradition.

31:02.643 --> 31:04.166
That's it.
That's our lead.

31:04.253 --> 31:05.907
Katie and Clara
are on that train.

31:05.994 --> 31:07.604
But something's not clicking.

31:07.691 --> 31:10.042
When Lang first took the girls,
he had months to plan.

31:10.129 --> 31:11.347
He studied his route.

31:11.434 --> 31:13.001
He knew
how to circumvent checkpoints.

31:13.088 --> 31:15.264
And right now,
he is under fire.

31:15.351 --> 31:17.005
All the more reason to run.

31:17.092 --> 31:18.746
Or maybe choose
to wait it out.

31:18.833 --> 31:20.835
That's your problem, Forrester.

31:20.922 --> 31:22.271
You don't make
sure-footed decisions.

31:22.358 --> 31:24.186
You like to fly
by the seat of your pants.

31:24.273 --> 31:25.796
That is
why we're making a change.

31:25.884 --> 31:28.451
If there's even a 5% chance
those girls are on that train,

31:28.538 --> 31:29.975
I will not risk losing them,

31:30.062 --> 31:31.541
so you can either get on board

31:31.628 --> 31:33.630
or waste your time
digging into Margarethe Lang.

31:33.717 --> 31:35.502
How did you know I was
looking into Lang's aunt?

31:35.589 --> 31:37.547
My job is to be
on top of things.

31:37.634 --> 31:39.027
Gear up.

31:46.121 --> 31:48.341
Hey.

31:48.428 --> 31:50.038
I know that
you and Dandridge are close,

31:50.125 --> 31:52.040
but just hear me out.

31:53.476 --> 31:54.651
OK.

31:54.738 --> 31:55.957
Some agents join the bureau

31:56.044 --> 31:56.784
to play the promotion game.

31:56.871 --> 31:59.221
Others work cases.

31:59.308 --> 32:00.266
It's naive
to think that any of us

32:00.353 --> 32:01.397
can escape the politicking.

32:01.484 --> 32:03.051
Sure.

32:03.138 --> 32:04.531
But when people ask me
whose side I'm on,

32:04.618 --> 32:05.749
I always say the victim's.

32:05.836 --> 32:07.360
And right now, Zoey,
you and me,

32:07.447 --> 32:09.536
this is
just two agents talking.

32:09.623 --> 32:11.451
You saw Dandridge right then.

32:11.538 --> 32:12.974
Is that the kind of guy
you wanna empower?

32:15.020 --> 32:16.456
But if you know something,

32:16.543 --> 32:19.198
if you know how he's been
on top of my every move,

32:19.285 --> 32:20.373
right now, you get to decide

32:20.460 --> 32:22.157
what kind of agent
you wanna be.

32:38.173 --> 32:39.740
Open it up.

32:39.827 --> 32:41.611
Open!

33:46.372 --> 33:47.373
All clear.

33:48.852 --> 33:50.376
Well?

33:50.463 --> 33:52.204
Nothing in the train cars
or crates.

33:52.291 --> 33:53.466
We missed something.

33:53.553 --> 33:54.467
They're not here.

33:54.554 --> 33:55.729
Raines, check the cameras.

33:55.816 --> 33:57.426
The last train
left six hours ago.

33:57.513 --> 33:58.862
The girls were never here.

33:58.949 --> 33:59.863
Our theory is that--

33:59.950 --> 34:01.778
They're not here.

35:26.080 --> 35:27.734
Shh.

35:34.523 --> 35:36.830
Katie Marsh,
Clara Brenner.

35:36.917 --> 35:38.527
I'm Scott.
I'm with the FBI.

35:38.614 --> 35:40.703
I'm gonna get you
out of here, OK?

35:40.790 --> 35:43.576
Where's Otto Lang?

35:43.663 --> 35:44.751
Aah!

35:44.838 --> 35:46.796
Get down!

35:54.587 --> 35:56.545
Aah!

36:36.237 --> 36:39.414
You're okay.
Hey, hey, you're okay.

37:11.925 --> 37:12.752
Hey, girls.

37:12.839 --> 37:15.233
You OK?

37:15.320 --> 37:18.192
So we're gonna take you both
back to the station.

37:18.279 --> 37:19.802
Katie,
your mom will meet us there.

37:24.416 --> 37:26.374
You're safe now.

37:35.688 --> 37:36.689
We got Lang.

37:38.734 --> 37:41.041
And I couldn't have done it
without you.

37:41.128 --> 37:43.870
So thank you.

37:45.350 --> 37:47.221
Katie's here waiting for you.

38:04.194 --> 38:06.327
Hey. Hey, Katie.

38:07.676 --> 38:08.851
Mom?

38:08.938 --> 38:11.027
Honey, you're safe now.

38:11.114 --> 38:12.768
You're going home.

38:12.855 --> 38:15.554
What about Clara?

38:15.641 --> 38:18.557
She's my sister.

38:18.644 --> 38:22.691
Every day
before Clara came along, I--

38:22.778 --> 38:26.478
I prayed
for everything to just be over.

38:28.871 --> 38:30.960
From the moment I saw her,

38:31.047 --> 38:32.484
she gave me hope.

38:34.312 --> 38:37.706
Mom...

38:37.793 --> 38:41.493
I stayed alive for Clara.

38:41.580 --> 38:43.843
And I am so happy you did, baby.

38:43.930 --> 38:47.542
Mom.

38:48.935 --> 38:50.415
I'm sorry, Mom.
- No.

38:50.502 --> 38:52.808
- I'm so sorry.
- No, I'm sorry.

38:52.895 --> 38:54.419
I love you.

38:56.856 --> 38:59.206
Deceased mother,
no next of kin.

38:59.293 --> 39:00.642
Policy in Austria would be

39:00.729 --> 39:02.688
to have Clara put
into their foster care system.

39:02.775 --> 39:04.385
There's adoption,
but we'd have to find--

39:04.472 --> 39:07.083
Allison and I will do it.

39:07.170 --> 39:08.433
Are you sure?

39:12.001 --> 39:14.961
Where's the paperwork?

39:15.048 --> 39:18.356
Senator, Deputy Director,
thanks for making the trip.

39:18.443 --> 39:19.922
Just the man
we were looking for.

39:21.489 --> 39:23.535
Well done.
- Thank you.

39:23.622 --> 39:25.188
Senator.
- Scott.

39:25.275 --> 39:27.495
If you'll recall, sir,
I was running point.

39:27.582 --> 39:28.844
We found Katie at a location--

39:28.931 --> 39:31.064
I was told it was
Special Agent Forrester

39:31.151 --> 39:32.718
who found Katie.

39:32.805 --> 39:35.068
Yes.
Yes, everyone did good work.

39:35.155 --> 39:37.244
A team effort,
under my direction.

39:38.767 --> 39:40.552
Your take?

39:40.639 --> 39:42.075
I was just doing my job, sir.

39:44.164 --> 39:46.558
Dandridge, I want you on the
next plane back to Washington.

39:46.645 --> 39:47.820
I'm sorry?

39:47.907 --> 39:49.343
You issued
an unauthorized wiretap

39:49.430 --> 39:50.910
on a federal agent's phone.

39:50.997 --> 39:52.520
What?

39:52.607 --> 39:54.043
His.

39:54.130 --> 39:56.132
How you knew where
this investigation was going,

39:56.219 --> 39:59.440
listening in like a weasel.

39:59.527 --> 40:02.312
Do I need to refer you to
the bureau's code of conduct?

40:05.794 --> 40:08.318
I figured out
how you bypassed the affidavit,

40:08.406 --> 40:11.234
and I told the deputy director.

40:11.321 --> 40:13.062
The Office
of Professional Responsibility

40:13.149 --> 40:15.021
would like a word,

40:15.108 --> 40:17.197
in person.

40:25.684 --> 40:28.382
As for you,
I was hoping you'd consider

40:28.469 --> 40:30.384
running the fly team
a little longer.

40:30.471 --> 40:32.473
It would be my privilege.

40:38.784 --> 40:40.307
Props to you, man,

40:40.394 --> 40:42.440
but you really left us hanging
till the last minute.

40:42.527 --> 40:43.702
Exert minimal effort.

40:43.789 --> 40:45.573
Use your opponent's force
against them.

40:45.660 --> 40:47.575
Aikido. Ever see
"Under Siege," Steven Seagal?

40:47.662 --> 40:49.098
I would've paid
a lot of money

40:49.185 --> 40:51.753
to see Scott and Dandridge
slug it out for real.

40:51.840 --> 40:53.407
Dandridge wouldn't have
lasted ten seconds.

40:54.495 --> 40:56.932
Your point?

40:57.019 --> 40:58.847
After Belgrade,
I told him to come after me

40:58.934 --> 41:00.675
with everything that he's got.

41:00.762 --> 41:02.634
Oh, I knew it'd throw him
into a tailspin.

41:02.721 --> 41:05.027
And McKenna,
you knew she'd flip?

41:05.114 --> 41:06.638
If only I were that good.

41:10.119 --> 41:11.425
I told her to come.

41:11.512 --> 41:13.296
Seems like
I was a bit too quick to judge.

41:13.383 --> 41:14.472
- Hey.
- Hi.

41:14.559 --> 41:16.822
- Hey. I'm buying.
- Hi.

41:16.909 --> 41:19.259
Uh, bourbon, neat.

41:19.346 --> 41:21.043
So what's next for you, Zoey?

41:21.130 --> 41:25.483
Uh, deputy legat position
in Warsaw just opened up, so...

41:25.570 --> 41:26.832
Running around with us
convinced you

41:26.919 --> 41:28.181
to chain yourself to a desk?

41:28.268 --> 41:31.140
Oh, I'll be back.
Just not sure when.

41:31.227 --> 41:31.967
Thanks.

41:32.054 --> 41:33.752
Cheers.

41:33.839 --> 41:35.493
all: Cheers.
