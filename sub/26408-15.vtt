00:01.690 --> 00:03.032
Previously onSEAL Team...DAVIS: I reapplied

00:03.090 --> 00:05.035
to Officer Candidate School.
Figured you should know.

00:05.090 --> 00:06.603
You are_ a leader.
You get In, you go.

00:06.650 --> 00:08.345
Cost of war isn't just paid
on the battlefield.

00:08.390 --> 00:10.267
I mean, it comes home
with us, right?

00:10.310 --> 00:11.789
Steals from us--
our lives,

00:11.830 --> 00:12.956
our marriages.

00:13.010 --> 00:14.966
Maybe even our faith.

00:15.010 --> 00:16.181
JASON:
Adam was killed in action.

00:16.230 --> 00:17.834
Gave his life
to save his brothers.

00:17.880 --> 00:19.279
He died a hero.

00:19.320 --> 00:21.663
I've been going to
a support group.Support group.

00:21.710 --> 00:22.961
That's, uh,
really not my thing.

00:23.020 --> 00:24.146
I figured.

00:24.190 --> 00:25.794
Did you just get back
from somewhere?

00:25.850 --> 00:27.272
Dirt under the fingernails,

00:27.330 --> 00:29.059
little rough around
the edges, huh?It's just a...

00:29.110 --> 00:30.668
a certain kind of tired
In your eyes.

00:41.510 --> 00:43.466
[sighs]

00:43.520 --> 00:45.124
[whispers]:
Disaster.

00:45.170 --> 00:47.218
VICTORIA:
It's a big decision
you got there.

00:47.260 --> 00:49.080
Hey. Hi.

00:49.130 --> 00:50.688
_ Victoria.
DIdn't see you there.Mm-hmm.

00:50.740 --> 00:53.129
No, you were...
you were lost downrange.

00:53.180 --> 00:55.216
You were very mission-focused.Well...

00:55.270 --> 00:59.172
you know,
way more decisive in the field.[chuckles]

00:59.230 --> 01:01.573
Tell you, when it comes to milk,
it's a whole different story.

01:01.620 --> 01:04.441
Emma likes skim.

01:04.490 --> 01:06.446
Mikey likes whole.

01:06.500 --> 01:07.979
It's like I'm playing
Russian roulette

01:08.020 --> 01:10.454
when I'm in the dairy section.I've been there.

01:10.500 --> 01:12.149
Good to see you.

01:12.200 --> 01:14.452
It is. You, too.

01:14.500 --> 01:16.456
Last month was
great. You know,

01:16.510 --> 01:18.159
I keep, uh, hoping
you're gonna...

01:18.200 --> 01:19.849
swing by the caf again.

01:19.900 --> 01:22.368
Oh, you know,
I've been busy. Work.

01:22.430 --> 01:24.728
You know, and, uh, kids.

01:24.780 --> 01:26.941
Be nice to catch up.

01:26.990 --> 01:31.086
Have you, um, tried
the new place on Circle Drive?

01:31.130 --> 01:32.779
Olivo's?

01:32.830 --> 01:34.218
Emma's been dying
to try that place.

01:34.260 --> 01:37.081
She says her taste buds
are way too sophisticated

01:37.140 --> 01:39.608
for the greasy spoons
I'm taking her to.

01:39.660 --> 01:42.003
Um, what about Friday night?

01:42.050 --> 01:44.792
Friday? No. Emma,
pinning her down on the weekend,

01:44.840 --> 01:46.922
forget it.Well, that's okay,

01:46.970 --> 01:48.926
'cause 1-1 was thinking, uh...

01:48.970 --> 01:50.926
just the two of us.

01:51.980 --> 01:54.369
Yeah. Sure, okay.

01:54.410 --> 01:56.492
Okay, it's settled. Friday.

01:56.550 --> 01:58.108
Yeah, Olivo's.

01:58.160 --> 01:59.411
Um...

01:59.460 --> 02:02.896
go for the one percent.

02:02.940 --> 02:05.329
It's a compromise, so...

02:05.380 --> 02:08.372
Okay. One percent it is.One percent.

02:08.430 --> 02:10.386
That's a good idea.Everybody's happy.

02:10.430 --> 02:12.421
Yeah.

02:14.390 --> 02:15.698
"When you pass
through the waters,

02:15.740 --> 02:17.731
"I will be with you;

02:17.780 --> 02:21.170
"and through the rivers,
they shall not overwhelm you.

02:21.220 --> 02:24.872
"When you walk through the fire,
you shall not be burned,

02:24.920 --> 02:27.388
and the flame
shall not consume you."

02:28.450 --> 02:30.406
This is the verse,

02:30.450 --> 02:33.749
when I lost my leg,
I turned to during rehab.

02:33.800 --> 02:37.236
It reminds me that I can
endure anything with faith.RAY: Well, you know,

02:37.280 --> 02:38.929
as, uh...

02:38.980 --> 02:40.754
someone who's
actually been burned,

02:40.810 --> 02:42.766
how-how do you keep your faith?

02:42.810 --> 02:44.118
[scoffs]

02:44.160 --> 02:46.116
I'm still alive.

02:46.160 --> 02:48.890
Well, a lot of people
are alive, right?

02:48.950 --> 02:50.429
I mean, they're living in places

02:50.470 --> 02:52.165
where so many
are crying out for God,

02:52.210 --> 02:54.599
and it doesn't seem
like he's answering.

02:54.650 --> 02:57.471
Makes you wonder
if he's anywhere at all.

02:57.520 --> 02:59.772
Are you...
are you feeling distance

02:59.830 --> 03:01.912
between yourself and God, Ray?

03:08.050 --> 03:10.006
Uh, maybe...

03:10.050 --> 03:11.790
maybe this is a blessing.

03:11.840 --> 03:14.354
M-Maybe going through this
will bring you closer to him.

03:16.840 --> 03:19.627
Or maybe the distance grows,

03:19.670 --> 03:23.231
and the only thing left
between me and God is space.

03:25.940 --> 03:28.283
How's it going, guys?

03:28.330 --> 03:30.286
[exhales]

03:33.160 --> 03:35.116
[Jason laughs]

03:35.170 --> 03:36.421
Walk of shame, huh?

03:38.340 --> 03:40.558
That obvious?Yeah.

03:40.610 --> 03:43.306
What was her name?Lisa.

03:44.350 --> 03:46.432
No, Lizzie.

03:46.480 --> 03:48.129
Well, it sounds serious.

03:48.180 --> 03:51.354
So... what,
you're staying here now?

03:51.400 --> 03:53.049
Bunking in the cages?

03:53.100 --> 03:55.091
Uh, yeah, you know, I just...

03:55.140 --> 03:58.018
I don't know, figured I need
a little change of scenery.

03:58.060 --> 04:00.187
Try and focus on the thing
that matters most in my life,

04:00.240 --> 04:01.753
being a Naw SEAL.That's the case,

04:01.800 --> 04:03.848
then you got to come out
tonight, meet Swanny.

04:03.890 --> 04:06.108
Brett Swann?Mm-hmm.

04:06.150 --> 04:08.801
Gee, that guy's a legend, man.

04:08.850 --> 04:10.158
He's a frogman's frogman.

04:10.200 --> 04:11.929
Hell-raiser back in the day.

04:11.990 --> 04:14.288
Hope he's not going
as strong as he used to,

04:14.340 --> 04:16.114
because that's just gonna
catch up to you.

04:16.160 --> 04:17.639
Burn you out.

04:17.690 --> 04:19.169
Know what I mean?

04:20.210 --> 04:22.337
Yeah. I hear you.

04:22.390 --> 04:26.030
[laughter]

04:26.090 --> 04:29.344
So, I'm tangled in a tree,
hanging there.

04:29.390 --> 04:30.823
There's Taliban all over.

04:30.870 --> 04:33.304
I got to... got to
cut free or I'm dead.

04:33.360 --> 04:36.523
But there's a... there's
a dog below me, a puppy.

04:36.580 --> 04:38.184
A puppy?BRE'|'l':
Yeah.

04:38.230 --> 04:40.539
Yeah, staring right up at me
with these big, brown eyes.

04:40.580 --> 04:42.138
And he won't move.

04:42.190 --> 04:43.703
If I... ifI cut away, I'll...

04:43.760 --> 04:45.796
I'm gonna drop straight down
and crush him.

04:45.850 --> 04:47.977
Is this for real?Mm-hmm.

04:48.020 --> 04:49.715
Yeah, the puppy was real.

04:49.760 --> 04:51.546
You risked your life
for a puppy?

04:51.590 --> 04:53.842
Oh, of course.
Well, what SEAL wouldn't?

04:53.900 --> 04:56.152
So, I start swinging.

04:56.200 --> 04:57.804
I, uh, get some momentum.

04:57.860 --> 04:59.464
I-I cut my line.

04:59.510 --> 05:02.775
I fall on a bunch of rocks,
but I miss the dog,

05:02.820 --> 05:05.072
who-who slobbers
all over my face.

05:05.130 --> 05:08.554
I broke an ankle, and I
separated my shoulder,

05:08.610 --> 05:10.953
but that dog...

05:11.000 --> 05:13.389
followed me around
the rest of deployment.

05:13.440 --> 05:14.782
He really did?Yeah.

05:14.830 --> 05:16.081
[chuckles]:
Yeah. Even better, we brought...

05:16.140 --> 05:17.300
we brought him back with us.

05:17.360 --> 05:18.782
We got him adopted.

05:18.840 --> 05:20.398
And you can feel where
I broke my shoulder.

05:20.450 --> 05:22.259
Feel-feel it right there.

05:22.320 --> 05:24.185
Oh, my God, I can feel it.Yeah, told you.

05:24.230 --> 05:26.573
Ooh.[laughs] You want a beer?

05:26.630 --> 05:27.927
Beers?Yeah.
Yeah.

05:27.970 --> 05:29.972
Joe, get some beers
for the ladies.

05:30.020 --> 05:31.840
[women laugh]So, what are you doing back
in town, man?

05:31.890 --> 05:34.415
Running away from
the former Mrs. Brett Swann,

05:34.460 --> 05:36.155
as not to be confused

05:36.200 --> 05:38.282
with the first and second
former Mrs. Brett Swann.

05:38.330 --> 05:40.150
[laughter]Swanns.

05:44.340 --> 05:46.160
CLAY:
Just, uh, just reliving
the old glory days, huh?

05:46.210 --> 05:49.998
Oh, yeah. Back to the
last place I felt alive.

05:50.040 --> 05:52.122
Try to crush that one up.[laughter]

05:52.170 --> 05:53.956
And-and, look, there's...
so there's...
Stop.

05:54.000 --> 05:55.820
No, listen, there's
this reindeer named Spin.Listen what?

05:55.870 --> 05:56.825
Reindeer? Spin?Right, babe?

05:56.870 --> 05:58.087
Sven.Sven.

05:58.140 --> 05:59.437
Sven.Yes. That's why
I got the antlers.

05:59.480 --> 06:00.617
You're telling me

06:00.660 --> 06:01.968
that you actually wear
the antlers

06:02.010 --> 06:04.001
while you're watching Frozen? Yes. Yes.

06:04.050 --> 06:05.529
Well, I'm sorry.At least he looks good
in them, Jason.

06:05.580 --> 06:07.445
I look good in them.Okay. Can he sing, too?

06:07.490 --> 06:10.095
Yeah, he can.Oh, you know what,
you can't ruin this for me, man.

06:10.150 --> 06:12.232
Uh, well, maybe
Jason's just jealous.

06:12.280 --> 06:13.838
To the antlers.

06:13.890 --> 06:15.619
Fishing for an invite to...You know, maybe, uh...

06:15.670 --> 06:17.194
maybe I got plans, okay?[|aughs]

06:17.240 --> 06:19.105
Oh, you got Friday night plans?
What you getting into?

06:19.160 --> 06:20.809
Don't worry about it.

06:20.850 --> 06:22.499
RAY: He ain't got no plans.NAIMA: Mm-mm.

06:22.550 --> 06:23.858
Oh, hey, there. [chuckles]Yeah.

06:23.900 --> 06:25.629
I, uh, I heard your
reindeer story.

06:25.680 --> 06:26.988
You liked that?

06:27.030 --> 06:28.634
It was... it was
funny. I liked it.Yeah.

06:28.690 --> 06:32.421
Um, you want to join
me for a drink?

06:32.470 --> 06:35.348
I would, but, um...Yeah.

06:35.390 --> 06:37.438
I'll take a rain check on that.

06:37.480 --> 06:39.175
Okay.Okay?

06:39.220 --> 06:42.041
So, you know,
team's all here.Yeah.

06:42.090 --> 06:44.957
No better time than now
to tell everybody.

06:45.010 --> 06:46.830
What do you want
me to tell them?

06:46.880 --> 06:49.519
You want me to tell them that
we're havrng an IIIICIt affair?

06:49.580 --> 06:51.741
Ooh, illicit. I like
the sound of that.Illicit.

06:51.800 --> 06:54.189
That sounds real dirty, huh?

06:54.230 --> 06:55.447
[laughs]You're horrible.

06:55.500 --> 06:57.968
[chuckles]

06:58.020 --> 07:00.625
Mm.No, seriously, I'm
talking about OCS.

07:00.680 --> 07:03.365
You know, you're
leaving pretty soon,

07:03.420 --> 07:05.069
and you haven't said
a word to anybody.

07:05.120 --> 07:08.203
Come on, Sonny. What, you want
me to steal Swanny's spotlight?

07:08.250 --> 07:09.547
Swanny's always a spotlight.[laughs]

07:09.600 --> 07:12.728
Don't worry about him.
You know, why not now?

07:12.780 --> 07:14.645
They're gonna be disappointed,

07:14.690 --> 07:16.738
you know, me going off
to be a cake-eater.

07:16.780 --> 07:18.862
No chance. You know that.

07:18.910 --> 07:20.992
They'll have your back.

07:21.040 --> 07:23.042
What's really stopping you?

07:23.090 --> 07:25.046
What if I don't cut it?

07:25.090 --> 07:26.694
You know,
I don't think I could...

07:26.750 --> 07:28.399
I couldn't handle
coming up short.

07:28.440 --> 07:29.839
There's nothing in life

07:29.880 --> 07:32.872
that I've ever seen
that you can't handle.

07:32.930 --> 07:34.875
Okay? Now, look,

07:34.930 --> 07:36.181
before I made Green Team,

07:36.230 --> 07:38.050
I was always worried
about washing out.

07:38.100 --> 07:40.056
And then I saddled up,

07:40.110 --> 07:42.066
and I'm living my dream, okay?

07:42.110 --> 07:44.237
You've earned the right
to live your dream.

07:44.280 --> 07:47.716
And you will. Okay?

07:47.770 --> 07:49.579
Okay.

07:49.640 --> 07:50.595
Okay?

07:50.640 --> 07:51.800
Okay.Okay?

07:51.860 --> 07:53.418
All right, I'm gonna do it.
I'm gonna do it.

07:53.470 --> 07:54.721
[chuckles][phones buzzing, ringing]

07:54.770 --> 07:56.294
Oh, hesitation kills.
Look at that.

07:56.340 --> 07:57.898
Ooh, saved by the bell.
Saved by the bell.

07:57.950 --> 07:59.679
I'm guessing you'll
keep yourself entertained,

07:59.740 --> 08:01.867
huh, while we're gone.Yeah, don't worry about me.

08:01.910 --> 08:04.253
I'll manage.Yeah.

08:04.300 --> 08:06.211
See you.

08:06.260 --> 08:08.171
See you, Swann.

08:08.220 --> 08:10.916
You know, I never realized how
much I'd miss getting shot at

08:10.960 --> 08:12.689
till the bullets
stopped coming my way.

08:12.750 --> 08:14.229
Your luck's gonna change.

08:14.270 --> 08:15.828
Yeah.

08:15.880 --> 08:17.393
All right, man.Hey, Jace.

08:17.450 --> 08:20.010
Yeah.I'm-I'm sorry about Alana.

08:20.060 --> 08:24.360
That I, you know,
didn't make the funeral.

08:24.410 --> 08:27.402
Yeah. I get it.

08:27.460 --> 08:29.451
Good to see you, Swanny.

08:32.460 --> 08:35.020
_MANDY:
Talmur Zaman.

08:35.070 --> 08:38.119

The 2012 bus bombing
in Bulgaria,

08:40.250 --> 08:43.424
as well as a string of bombings
in Lebanon and Israel.

08:43.470 --> 08:45.290
This guy Zaman's been an issue
for years.

08:45.350 --> 08:47.033
Why we going after him now?

08:47.090 --> 08:50.992

08:51.050 --> 08:53.132
has killed _
a dozen American soldiers

08:53.180 --> 08:54.397
in the last two months.

08:54.440 --> 08:55.782
Two just yesterday.

08:55.830 --> 08:57.388
Zaman's survived this long

08:57.440 --> 08:58.611
by staying outside
of Afghanistan.

08:58.660 --> 08:59.877
It's hard to imagine

08:59.930 --> 09:01.579
he's operating there
in our baclqard now.

09:01.620 --> 09:03.485
He's not in Afghanistan.

09:03.540 --> 09:05.496
Zaman's taken up safe harbor
in Iran.

09:05.540 --> 09:07.496
SONNY:
Well, Iran's kryptonite

09:07.540 --> 09:09.098
for pencil pushers
and cake-eaters,

09:09.150 --> 09:11.106
so there's no chance in hell
they're gonna let us operate

09:11.150 --> 09:12.458
in there.Zero chance.

09:12.500 --> 09:13.899
CLAY:
Be a good way
to start a war.

09:13.940 --> 09:15.328
MANDY:
Would be.

09:15.380 --> 09:16.938
But we have verified intel

09:16.990 --> 09:20.505
that Zaman is traveling
to a town called Hajiabad

09:20.560 --> 09:23.461
to meet some
Hezbollah higher-ups.

09:23.510 --> 09:27.776
Hajiabad sits on the edge
of the Iran-Afghanistan border.

09:27.820 --> 09:29.344
We're still gonna be
sneaking and creeping

09:29.390 --> 09:31.255
into Iran to get him.ERIC:
We're not going into Iran.

09:31.300 --> 09:33.518
And this is_ not
a capture mi55ion.

09:33.570 --> 09:35.174
You've been authorized

09:35.220 --> 09:36.949
to eliminate Zaman.

09:37.010 --> 09:39.001
This is a special programs op.

09:39.050 --> 09:41.962
That why they didn't want
to use a deployed team.

09:42.010 --> 09:43.318
Yeah.

09:43.360 --> 09:45.225
No one can know about this one.

09:46.320 --> 09:47.753
MANDY:
It's imperative

09:47.800 --> 09:50.268
that you take the
shot outside of Iran

09:50.320 --> 09:53.198
on the Afghan side
of the border.

09:54.240 --> 09:55.969
No easy day.

10:10.870 --> 10:13.600
Latest intel confirms this
as the target house.

10:13.650 --> 10:17.120
Zaman and Hezbollah are set
to meet in two days.

10:17.180 --> 10:18.477
Okay, well,
I'm looking at terrain.

10:18.530 --> 10:20.088
There's not many options.
I mean, look,

10:20.140 --> 10:21.209
there's a roclq
outcropping here.

10:21.270 --> 10:22.692
We get an angle
on the house.

10:22.750 --> 10:24.570
What do you think, Ray?
.338 Lapua?

10:24.620 --> 10:27.054
No other cover or concealment,
we'd be hanging it out there.

10:27.100 --> 10:29.443
Especially if we get seen.
There's no easy escape.

10:29.490 --> 10:32.095
What are you thinking?
Longer shot from a hide?

10:32.150 --> 10:33.492
We can build one here.

10:33.540 --> 10:35.496
Looks like enough vegetation
to get cozy.

10:35.540 --> 10:37.098
SONNY:
How long do you
think that is?

10:38.200 --> 10:40.156
Is that 1,500 meters?

10:40.200 --> 10:43.249
[whistles] That is a long shot.

10:43.290 --> 10:45.804
[chuckles]Yeah, well, don't confuse
distance with difficulty, son.

10:45.860 --> 10:47.816
It's gonna be a hard shot
no matter what.

10:47.860 --> 10:50.499
I've made harder.
[laughing]

10:50.560 --> 10:53.427
Quickscoping on Call of Duty
does not count, Spenser.

10:53.470 --> 10:55.813
Right. Okay.
So, what's the infil plan?

10:55.870 --> 10:58.771
Dropping you in at a distance
with the Osprey.

10:58.830 --> 11:01.822
You're looking at a 20-klick
patrol to Hajiabad.

11:01.870 --> 11:04.998
CLAY:
Ooh. What if Zaman's
men counterattack?

11:05.050 --> 11:07.006
Then our government
might recognize borders,

11:07.050 --> 11:08.608
but Hezbollah doesn't.

11:08.660 --> 11:12.221
Our thinking is they'll
hunker down after Zaman falls.

11:12.280 --> 11:15.010
During the chaos, you guys
will patrol back to the L2.

11:15.060 --> 11:16.709
Safe in, safe out.

11:16.760 --> 11:19.058
Safe in, safe out.

11:20.810 --> 11:24.541
All right. There's a lot of ways
for this one to go south.

11:24.590 --> 11:27.115
Gonna take a hell of a shot.

11:27.160 --> 11:29.628
Yeah. Good thing
you're rolling

11:29.680 --> 11:32.023
with a hell of a shooter.Oh, yeah?

11:32.080 --> 11:34.378
It was good to see you
out with Naima.

11:34.430 --> 11:36.079
Oh, yeah, man,

11:36.130 --> 11:39.429
I'm trying to win
back points with her.Yeah. Everything good?

11:39.480 --> 11:41.380
Yeah. Yeah.

11:41.430 --> 11:43.386
Yeah?
It's just,
you know...

11:43.440 --> 11:45.044
Hey, I couldn't help but
notice that blonde...

11:45.090 --> 11:46.398
Yeah.

11:46.440 --> 11:48.089
...at the, uh, bar
giving you the business.

11:48.140 --> 11:49.789
Mm-hmm.
Smoke-show, right?

11:49.830 --> 11:52.048
Oh, yeah. Ready to
start dating again?

11:52.100 --> 11:55.319
Yeah, I'm thinking about dating.

11:55.360 --> 11:56.884
It's just, uh...

11:56.930 --> 11:58.886
everything with the kids,
you know?

11:58.930 --> 12:00.443
Mikey and Emma.

12:00.500 --> 12:03.139
I don't want to rock the boat
at home right now.

12:03.200 --> 12:05.145
Oh, well, the past few months,

12:05.200 --> 12:07.156
you've been focused on
everyone but yourself.

12:07.200 --> 12:09.634
Nobody'd think twice if
you got back out there.

12:09.680 --> 12:11.113
Just...

12:11.160 --> 12:14.118
no barflies, 'cause you
got a lot on your plate.

12:14.160 --> 12:15.889
Okay.
Might be nice to have
someone to talk to.

12:15.950 --> 12:18.726
Why don't you get some shut-eye
like this guy right here?

12:18.780 --> 12:20.554
Yeah. You, too.

12:20.600 --> 12:22.477
RAY:
He ain't even
flinching.

12:24.740 --> 12:26.219
Eric Blackburn.
How are you?

12:26.260 --> 12:28.342
Hey, what do you say, Mike?
It's been a while.

12:28.390 --> 12:29.652
Long while.
You're looking old.

12:29.700 --> 12:31.474
Not as old as you.
What happened?

12:31.530 --> 12:33.839
Clearly, I'm working
harder than you.
Nice.

12:33.880 --> 12:36.519
Now that we got the sweet talk
out of the way...

12:36.580 --> 12:38.616
Right. My Marines are
loaded up and waiting.

12:38.670 --> 12:40.012
We're ready to launch

12:40.060 --> 12:42.142
on your notice.Appreciate it, Mike,

12:42.190 --> 12:44.272
but hopefully,
we won't need that QRF.

12:44.320 --> 12:46.629
Well, we'll get
your boys home if we do.

12:46.670 --> 12:49.195
Agent Ellis,
this is Colonel Mike Smith.Agent.

12:49.240 --> 12:51.629
To be clear, Colonel,
none of us are here.

12:51.680 --> 12:52.897
How's that, ma'am?

12:52.940 --> 12:56.410
Bravo, us-- this is
a black-site op.

12:56.470 --> 12:58.813
Understood, ma'am.
I've been read in.

12:58.860 --> 13:01.112
I'll let you get back to it.

13:01.170 --> 13:03.126
We call in a Marine QRF,

13:03.170 --> 13:06.162
everyone's gonna know it was
us who moved in on Zaman.

13:06.220 --> 13:08.427
Oh. If this op goes sideways,

13:08.480 --> 13:10.948
the Marines are
Bravo Team's only way home.

13:11.000 --> 13:12.649
In that event,

13:12.700 --> 13:15.954
Marines become the only way
the CIA keeps this op black.

14:15.590 --> 14:17.319
CLAY:
That's Hajiabad.

14:17.370 --> 14:19.895
Border with Iran's
about a klick and a half.

14:23.550 --> 14:25.984
Eric, this is 1.
We pass Crystal.

14:26.030 --> 14:27.509
ERIC:
Good copy, Bravo 1.

14:27.560 --> 14:29.460
Passing Crystal. Havoc out.

14:34.560 --> 14:36.471
How's your line of sight?

14:36.520 --> 14:38.476
It's far,
but it's in range.

14:38.520 --> 14:40.260
RAY:
Target house?

14:40.310 --> 14:43.006
CLAY:
Yeah, clear line of sight.

14:43.050 --> 14:45.041
Looks good.All right, boys,
let's get to work.

14:45.100 --> 14:46.704
Ray, Sonny.

14:46.750 --> 14:48.923
Break out the hide.
The rest of you pull security.

14:48.970 --> 14:51.575
Only a few hours to sunup.
Let's get it built.

14:56.980 --> 14:58.322
Havoc, this is 1.

14:58.370 --> 15:00.326
You have any updates
before we get to work?

15:00.370 --> 15:02.975
Yeah. Intel says your HVT
is on the move.

15:03.030 --> 15:06.022
Minimum of five hours
before he arrives on target.

15:06.070 --> 15:07.412
Havoc out.

15:20.480 --> 15:22.471
[wind whistling softly]

15:48.330 --> 15:50.116
How much longer?

15:50.160 --> 15:52.765
You're like a kid in
the back of the station wagon.

15:52.820 --> 15:56.460
RAY:
Last COMMs window
had him two hours out.

15:56.520 --> 15:58.465
Well...

15:58.520 --> 16:00.863
what do you say there,
Riclq Schroder,

16:00.910 --> 16:03.128
we make ourselves
a little wager

16:03.170 --> 16:05.126
till our friend shows up.

16:05.180 --> 16:08.001
Sonny, the last time we
wagered, you ended up

16:08.050 --> 16:10.006
in an American flag bikini
running down Main Street.

16:10.050 --> 16:12.006
That's right, and Old Glory
never looked better.

16:12.050 --> 16:13.836
You know what this is?

16:13.880 --> 16:17.316
You got two minutes
to eat these crackers.
Mm-hmm.

16:17.360 --> 16:20.534
Now, if you fail, which
you will-- all right?--

16:20.580 --> 16:22.662
you got to detail
my motorcycle

16:22.720 --> 16:26.326
with a toothbrush,
wearing a very sew bikini.

16:26.370 --> 16:29.157
Okay? If you succeed,
which you won't,

16:29.200 --> 16:31.760
I will wax your Nova
butt-naked.

16:31.810 --> 16:33.334
Sonny, I'm a thoroughbred.

16:33.380 --> 16:35.336
You don't think I can do
the old cracker challenge?

16:35.380 --> 16:36.722
Okay. Okay, hey,
no water, though.

16:36.770 --> 16:39.204
You take one sip,
and it is "wax on, wax off,"

16:39.250 --> 16:42.902
Yeah.and some very sexy
bikini lines.

16:42.950 --> 16:45.259
Never gonna get him, man.CLAY: I got this.
This is...

16:45.300 --> 16:48.736
Go. You ain't got
anything, man.

16:48.790 --> 16:50.212
[others laughing]

16:50.270 --> 16:53.046
Oh-ho. No big deal.[Jason imitates
muffled talking]

16:53.090 --> 16:54.967
You got it. Hey.[chuckles]

16:55.010 --> 16:57.353
And the ones on the ground, too.
You got to eat those as well.

16:57.400 --> 16:59.220
That's the whole cracker,
counting every crumb.

16:59.270 --> 17:01.534
Look at how slow
that jaw's movmg.

17:01.580 --> 17:03.013
It's dry like the desert.

17:03.060 --> 17:04.402
Dry like the Sahara.

17:04.450 --> 17:06.270
Hey, you're done,
buddy.

17:06.320 --> 17:08.015
He's done.
Yeah, yeah.

17:08.070 --> 17:09.583
This never gets o|d.We're at 25 seconds.

17:09.630 --> 17:11.109
RAY:
Hold up, boys,
we may have a problem.

17:11.160 --> 17:12.843
What do you got?

17:12.900 --> 17:14.379
Not sure.

17:17.210 --> 17:18.984
JASON:
That's our target house.

17:19.030 --> 17:20.509
What do you think they're up to?

17:20.560 --> 17:22.778
RAY:
I don't know, they're concerned

17:22.820 --> 17:24.333
about something.

17:24.390 --> 17:26.335
Think they're calling
an audible?

17:26.390 --> 17:30.167
JASON:
They're pointing
at another building.

17:30.220 --> 17:32.085
Looks like
they're moving the meet.

17:32.130 --> 17:34.473
Considering what we're
about to do, they're not wrong.

17:34.530 --> 17:36.339
What's the eye in the sky say?

17:36.400 --> 17:37.913
Havoc, this is 1.

17:37.960 --> 17:40.178
I'm looking
at what appears to be,

17:40.230 --> 17:42.619
uh, enemy soldiers
leaving the target house.

17:42.670 --> 17:44.740
You got anything
you can tell us about them?

17:44.800 --> 17:47.837
Yeah, copy, 1.
Let me see what we can find.

17:47.890 --> 17:50.279
We can't be burned already.

17:56.510 --> 17:58.762
They've definitely
moved the meet.

18:00.250 --> 18:02.070
Yeah.
Bravo 1, this is Havoc Base.

18:02.120 --> 18:04.429
It appears the meet
is moving to a new location

18:04.470 --> 18:06.074
75 meters southwest

18:06.120 --> 18:08.122
of the original target location.

18:08.170 --> 18:10.252
How copy?Copy. Meet's moving

18:10.300 --> 18:12.120
75 meters southwest.

18:12.170 --> 18:14.559
New lo_cation's_
out of our line of Sight.

18:14.610 --> 18:16.601
We don't have the shot.

18:23.140 --> 18:24.448
I'm not seeing
any acceptable spots

18:24.490 --> 18:27.129
for Bravo Team to build
a new sniper hide.

18:27.190 --> 18:29.090
There's no clear line of sight
to the new target house.

18:29.150 --> 18:30.959
What about this outcrop?
It's hard to tell from ISR,

18:31.020 --> 18:33.580
but it could work.Yeah, they may be
able to take the shot,

18:33.630 --> 18:35.404
but they'll be out in the open.To get there,

18:35.460 --> 18:37.234
they have to cross a field
in broad daylight.

18:37.290 --> 18:39.451
And I don't like the odds
of the enemy not spotting them

18:39.500 --> 18:41.764
even if it is
a good final firing position.

18:41.810 --> 18:44.540
Plus, exfil will be near
impossible if they're detected.

18:44.600 --> 18:47.068
It's Jason's call. If he thinks
he can set up an FFP

18:47.120 --> 18:49.076
in no-man's-land and
take a shot, fine.

18:49.120 --> 18:50.382
Otherwise...

18:50.430 --> 18:53.126
we think about
bringing them back now.

19:04.400 --> 19:06.391
We got trucks moving in.

19:17.330 --> 19:19.491
No way we make that shot
from here, boss.

19:19.540 --> 19:20.882
Right.

19:22.770 --> 19:24.249
ERIC:
Bravo 1, this is Havoc.

19:24.290 --> 19:25.848
We've found a possible

19:25.900 --> 19:27.288
new observation point.

19:27.340 --> 19:28.853
It's about 300 meters

19:28.900 --> 19:30.720
north of your pos.
Do you see it?

19:33.820 --> 19:35.208
Yeah.

19:35.260 --> 19:36.989
Yeah, I see it.

19:37.040 --> 19:40.692
It's nothing but flat green
between us and FFP.

19:43.260 --> 19:45.433
we'll be hanging out
like a dog's balls.

19:45.480 --> 19:47.209
What other options do we have?

19:47.270 --> 19:48.692
Wait here for nightfall

19:48.750 --> 19:51.139
and sneak out without
ever taking a shot?

19:52.750 --> 19:54.274
JASON:
Havoc, this is 1.

19:54.320 --> 19:55.833
We see the position
you're talking about.

19:55.890 --> 19:57.835
You think you can make
a shot from there?

19:57.890 --> 19:59.881
Yeah, we need confirmation that
we got clean line of sight

19:59.930 --> 20:01.625
to that new target house.

20:01.670 --> 20:03.626
How long before you can get
something up over that position?

20:03.680 --> 20:06.069
Two mikes to confirm.
Stand by.

20:06.110 --> 20:08.021
I can make that shot.

20:08.070 --> 20:09.549
I know you can make
the shot. So can Ray.

20:09.590 --> 20:11.638
I need you here with
your rifle, covering us,

20:11.680 --> 20:12.942
to get to that
O-P, got it?

20:12.990 --> 20:14.423
Okay.

20:14.470 --> 20:15.767
Ray.

20:15.820 --> 20:17.549
I'll grab my stuff.

20:17.600 --> 20:19.420
ERIC:
Bravo 1, this is Havoc.

20:19.470 --> 20:22.030
Line of sight
from the new FFP is clean.

20:22.090 --> 20:23.739
How copy?Copy that, Havoc.

20:23.780 --> 20:25.429
Bravo 1 out.

20:25.480 --> 20:27.732
Now all we got to do
is get there.

20:44.060 --> 20:46.403
We're about halfway there.

20:46.460 --> 20:48.803
Out of all the situations we've
been thrown into, brother,

20:48.850 --> 20:50.898
we never hung it
out there like this.

20:50.940 --> 20:52.282
Hey, Ray?

20:52.330 --> 20:53.547
Yeah?

20:53.600 --> 20:55.727
Have a little faith.

20:57.950 --> 20:59.372
Yeah.

20:59.430 --> 21:00.943
Faith.

21:03.130 --> 21:07.248
Awful quiet
there, McDreamy.

21:07.300 --> 21:09.086
Oh, let me guess:

21:09.130 --> 21:11.519
you think you should be
the one taking the shot.

21:14.050 --> 21:17.747
Yep. Thought so.

21:17.790 --> 21:20.054
You know, maybe you should
be pulling the trigger,

21:20.100 --> 21:22.056
but there ain't no
need for you to act

21:22.100 --> 21:23.658
like somebody peed
in your cornflakes.

21:23.710 --> 21:26.531
Just want to pull my share.

21:26.580 --> 21:29.105
But I respect Jason's call.

21:29.150 --> 21:31.289
Now, easy there,
little buddy.

21:31.330 --> 21:33.025
Don't get too respectful.

21:33.070 --> 21:34.765
I don't want to go back
to being the biggest

21:34.810 --> 21:36.766
pain in the ass
on the team.

21:39.160 --> 21:41.424
CLAY:
They're about a hundred yards
from the new position.

21:41.470 --> 21:43.290
Looks like
they're gonna make it.

21:43.340 --> 21:44.944
Shh. Don't jinx it.

21:44.990 --> 21:46.423
Ah, come on, man.

21:46.470 --> 21:49.428
Look what you done.

21:49.480 --> 21:50.777
Freeze.

21:53.390 --> 21:55.779
Can't see from our position.
What do you got?

21:55.830 --> 21:57.957
SONNY:
Got a guy walking towards you.

21:58.010 --> 21:59.398
He's glassing.

22:05.930 --> 22:07.352
You think you can
take that shot?

22:07.410 --> 22:10.311
No. Jason and Ray took the .338.

22:11.760 --> 22:13.148
SONNY:
All right, he's walking back.

22:13.200 --> 22:14.451
You're clear.

22:14.500 --> 22:16.843
Good. We're moving.

22:27.080 --> 22:29.071
[grunts]

22:38.530 --> 22:40.748
Line of sight
to the target building.

22:40.790 --> 22:42.917
We're in business.

22:45.230 --> 22:47.004
Havoc, this is 1.

22:47.060 --> 22:49.358
We got eyes on
the new target building.

22:49.410 --> 22:51.492
This will be our new FFP.

22:51.540 --> 22:53.019
Good copy, Bravo 1.

22:53.060 --> 22:56.359
We just picked up
HVT's vehicle on ISR.

22:56.410 --> 22:57.968
He's ten klicks out.

22:58.020 --> 22:59.578
ETA seven minutes.

22:59.630 --> 23:03.111
Hey, Ray,
time to pay the bills.

23:03.160 --> 23:05.765
I'll call wind for you,
old-school, huh?

23:05.810 --> 23:07.459
I'm gonna need
it out here.

23:07.510 --> 23:08.852
Yeah, that's right.

23:13.520 --> 23:15.203
CLAY:
Hey, boss, you got a problem.

23:15.260 --> 23:16.511
You got two kids,

23:16.560 --> 23:17.606
about 700 meters from your pos.

23:17.650 --> 23:19.379
They appear to be flying
a kite.

23:21.740 --> 23:25.176
RAY:
I'll be damned if we can't catch
a break today, boss.

23:27.620 --> 23:30.134
If this thing goes south,

23:30.190 --> 23:32.795
ain't nobody better find out
we got done in

23:32.840 --> 23:34.444
by two kids flying kites.

23:34.500 --> 23:36.445
'Cause I'll tell you what,
it's gonna give me

23:36.500 --> 23:39.879
a serious case
of the red ass.

23:39.940 --> 23:41.714
There's no way
we'll take those kids prisoners.

23:41.760 --> 23:43.159
We'll never get the shot.

23:45.030 --> 23:46.372
RAY:
Boss.

23:50.860 --> 23:54.330
What do you want me to do?
They're 35 meters off you.

24:22.540 --> 24:24.758
Havoc, this is 1.

24:24.810 --> 24:26.801
O-P-2 has a soft compromise.

24:26.850 --> 24:29.580
Two kids.Yeah, that's a solid copy,
Bravo 1.

24:29.640 --> 24:31.460
We're just picking them up
on ISR. I'd say you got

24:31.510 --> 24:33.592
about ten minutes before
they make it back to town.

24:33.640 --> 24:35.460
Need you to exfil
before they do.

24:35.510 --> 24:38.115
Check. How far out is HVT?

24:38.170 --> 24:40.775
Sir, the HVT's arriving now.

24:40.820 --> 24:44.290
All stations be advised,
HVT is arriving now.

24:44.350 --> 24:46.124
Copy that.

24:46.180 --> 24:47.989
RAY:
Two Mercedes
with technical vehicles

24:48.050 --> 24:50.177
coming in from the east.

24:51.830 --> 24:53.786
CLAY:
Your soft compromise

24:53.840 --> 24:55.523
is still a few minutes
from town.

24:55.580 --> 24:57.969
If they don't get out of there
before those kids get to town

24:58.010 --> 25:00.444
and give up their position,
they're as good as dead.

25:00.490 --> 25:02.754
It's our only shot
at getting Zaman.

25:02.800 --> 25:04.973
Bravo Team could have enemy
massed on their position

25:05.020 --> 25:07.193
faster than they
can say "exfil."

25:07.240 --> 25:10.937
Shall I let Colonel Smith know
we need the Marine QRF?

25:10.980 --> 25:13.585
Not yet.

25:13.640 --> 25:16.803
[wind whistling]

25:16.860 --> 25:19.112
[indistinct chatter]

25:19.160 --> 25:20.900
JASON:
Wind's kicking.

25:20.950 --> 25:22.599
RAY:
Yeah. Holding
pretty steady

25:22.650 --> 25:24.686
at 15 to 20 mile-per-hour
crosswind, but...

25:24.740 --> 25:26.298
problem is it's coming
from the valley.

25:26.350 --> 25:27.908
It keeps switching
directions, brother.

25:27.960 --> 25:30.121
Come on, Ray. I've seen you
make tougher shots than this.

25:30.180 --> 25:32.569
[indistinct chatter]

25:32.610 --> 25:33.565
RAY:
There he is.

25:33.610 --> 25:34.781
JASON:
Yeah.

25:34.830 --> 25:35.876
RAY:
Zaman. Call it.

25:35.920 --> 25:37.046
JASON:
Wait. Whoa, whoa.

25:37.100 --> 25:38.351
Wait.

25:39.400 --> 25:41.834
JASON:
Hold.

25:46.710 --> 25:49.019
Two Zamans.

25:49.060 --> 25:51.540
Perfect.

25:51.590 --> 25:52.978
Body double.

26:01.160 --> 26:02.377
JASON:
We have to engage both.

26:02.430 --> 26:04.034
You take one,
I'll take the other.

26:04.080 --> 26:06.298
Not with that rifle at
this distance, brother.

26:06.340 --> 26:08.035
No, I can take both,
but I need you to spot

26:08.080 --> 26:09.729
and call wind for me.

26:13.260 --> 26:15.046
Bravo 1, this is Bravo 6.

26:15.090 --> 26:17.342
Your soft compromise is about
a minute from town.

26:17.400 --> 26:18.469
If you don't move
back here now,

26:18.530 --> 26:19.485
you're gonna get stuck
out there.

26:19.530 --> 26:21.430
Negative, 6, stand by.

26:24.270 --> 26:25.794
The real Zaman is the one
who'll be giving orders.

26:25.840 --> 26:27.796
He's the one in charge,
that's how we I.D. him.

26:27.840 --> 26:29.364
Copy that.

26:31.630 --> 26:33.234
J, they're both talking
to the Hezbollah commander.

26:33.280 --> 26:35.589
I can't tell
which one's which.

26:35.630 --> 26:36.756
What are you seeing?

26:38.420 --> 26:40.718
CLAY:
Nothing good.

26:42.860 --> 26:44.851
Bravo 1, this is Bravo 6.
Your soft compromise

26:44.900 --> 26:46.720
has disappeared into town.
How copy?

26:46.770 --> 26:49.386
Good copy. Stand by.

26:49.430 --> 26:52.866
Hey, blondie.

26:52.910 --> 26:55.731
Something's fixing
to happen.

26:55.780 --> 26:58.658
I think you should
carb-load up.

26:58.700 --> 27:01.339
[chuckles]

27:01.400 --> 27:03.391
[indistinct chatter]

27:07.710 --> 27:09.666
[indistinct shouting]

27:09.710 --> 27:12.099
JASON:
Tell me when and I'll start
the wind calls.

27:12.150 --> 27:14.448
RAY:
There he is. Zaman. I got him.

27:14.500 --> 27:16.365
On the left. Call it.

27:16.410 --> 27:19.584
JASON:
Seven left... Nine left.

27:21.420 --> 27:23.285
Pull right.Pulled.

27:23.330 --> 27:25.025
JASON:
Ten right.

27:25.070 --> 27:26.935
Hold.

27:26.990 --> 27:28.150
RAY_:
Damn it, J.
This wind's killing us.

27:28.210 --> 27:30.019
Just got to ride it out.

27:30.080 --> 27:31.377
Sir.

27:31.430 --> 27:33.034
There's something going on.

27:33.080 --> 27:35.128
There's a lot of enemy
activity on target.

27:35.170 --> 27:37.821
All right.
That's it.

27:37.870 --> 27:39.212
I'm calling it.

27:39.260 --> 27:41.251
Get the QRF moving.

27:43.090 --> 27:45.046
Bravo 1, this
is Havoc Base.

27:45.090 --> 27:47.138
You have a hard compromise

27:47.180 --> 27:48.966
and an enemy moving
on your position.

27:49.010 --> 27:51.228
Begin your exfil
immediately. How copy?

27:51.270 --> 27:54.182
Bravo 1, did you copy my last?

27:54.230 --> 27:55.629
_ RAY:
He's getting real antsy, J.

27:55.670 --> 27:57.797
Stay in the scope,
Ray, we're doing this.

27:57.850 --> 27:58.976
MAN [over radio]:
Vanquish 1-6, this is Tower.

27:59.020 --> 28:00.055
You're green to go.

28:02.980 --> 28:04.322
Copy, Tower.

28:14.470 --> 28:16.779
[indistinct radio chatter]

28:45.940 --> 28:47.362
RAY:
Wind's still shifting.

28:47.420 --> 28:48.808
JASON:
DeCI5ion, Ray.

28:48.850 --> 28:51.068
Wind, ten right.

28:51.120 --> 28:53.190
On you.RAY:
Taking it.

28:54.820 --> 28:56.811
High right.

28:56.860 --> 28:58.589
Hit.

29:00.260 --> 29:01.682
CLAY:
Bravo 1, you're about

29:01.740 --> 29:03.207
to get some serious contact.

29:06.830 --> 29:08.309
They're moving on us.

29:10.660 --> 29:12.218
Here we go.

29:25.320 --> 29:26.924
Got to move!

29:28.280 --> 29:30.931
RAY: There's no way,
not with that heavy gun on us!

29:31.680 --> 29:32.760
We stay here, we're done!

29:38.420 --> 29:40.024
DAVIS:
Sir, the enemy force is mobile.

29:40.080 --> 29:41.559
They've set up a base element
forward of the town

29:41.600 --> 29:42.851
and are moving on Bravo
with vehicles.

29:42.910 --> 29:44.207
Looks like heaw guns
mounted in the back.

29:44.260 --> 29:47.161
All right, Mike, how
far out are your boys?

29:47.220 --> 29:48.778
Inbound now.
Inside two minutes.

29:53.000 --> 29:54.956
[indistinct radio chatter]

30:06.100 --> 30:08.534
Bravo 3.
Cover our movement out of here!

30:08.580 --> 30:10.059
SONNY:
Copy that.

30:10.110 --> 30:11.884
Stand by.

30:13.760 --> 30:14.931
Ray!
Yeah!

30:14.980 --> 30:16.288
Throw some smoke
so they can cover us.

30:16.330 --> 30:17.319
Copy.

30:40.530 --> 30:42.486
[indistinct shouting]

30:48.450 --> 30:49.576
Ray!
Yeah!

30:49.630 --> 30:51.313
Go!

30:56.410 --> 30:58.059
[Ray shouts indistinctly]

31:05.640 --> 31:08.632
I got to change this barrel out
or I'm gonna melt this thing!

31:09.650 --> 31:11.163
QRF should be here any minute.

31:11.210 --> 31:12.643
Just keep hammering!

31:16.390 --> 31:18.608
[rapid gunfire continues]

31:21.960 --> 31:23.916
I'm almost Winchester!

31:25.140 --> 31:27.313
Havoc, how far out
is the QRF?

31:27.360 --> 31:29.749
Bravo 1, QRF is inbound.

31:29.800 --> 31:32.052
ETA: 60 seconds.

31:38.630 --> 31:40.325
Ray, lay out
some more smoke.

31:40.370 --> 31:42.065
Copy.

31:53.250 --> 31:55.389
Bravo 3, get to the L2.

32:00.130 --> 32:01.859
We're sunk here
without them, Jace.

32:01.920 --> 32:05.174
Well... we got to hold tight
till they can extract us.

32:47.610 --> 32:50.078
RAY:
Oorah!

33:12.900 --> 33:14.800
Go! Go! Go!

33:18.470 --> 33:20.290
[shouting indistinctly]

34:20.970 --> 34:22.699
Tell you, that was one
hell of a shot, Ray.

34:22.750 --> 34:24.001
You can wear

34:24.060 --> 34:25.709
those reindeer antlers
With pride tonight.

34:25.750 --> 34:27.229
RAY:
I will, brother.

34:28.580 --> 34:30.184
Just got word

34:30.240 --> 34:32.014
Zaman is still alive.

34:32.070 --> 34:33.970
Shot must've clipped him.

34:34.020 --> 34:37.899
I've been called in
to talk to the brass
as soon as we get back.

34:42.550 --> 34:44.939
Damn it, I had him, J.No, don't put it
on yourself, man.

34:44.990 --> 34:47.686
Things get wonlq.
It happens.

34:47.730 --> 34:49.459
Yeah.

34:49.520 --> 34:50.942
[exhales]

34:51.000 --> 34:53.560
Hey, hey.

34:53.610 --> 34:55.737
We'll get him next time.

35:05.270 --> 35:06.919
[sighs]

35:18.980 --> 35:21.289
SONNY:
Hey, who's going out drinking
at the bar?

35:21.330 --> 35:22.718
JASON: Ah...RAY: You know what?

35:22.770 --> 35:23.805
I don't think I can handle

35:23.860 --> 35:25.111
this Frozensing-along tonight.

35:25.160 --> 35:27.116
Uh, I'm in. Jace?No.

35:27.160 --> 35:28.764
No, I got plans.

35:28.820 --> 35:31.596
Hey, I got something to say.

35:31.650 --> 35:33.993
Um...

35:38.650 --> 35:41.778
I got accepted
to Officer Candidate School.

35:43.010 --> 35:45.171
This was my last
mission with you.

35:45.230 --> 35:46.788
[voice breaks]:
And, uh...

35:46.840 --> 35:50.389
it kills me to
leave Bravo,

35:50.450 --> 35:52.964
and I'm sorry that
I couldn't tell you till now.

35:56.240 --> 35:57.719
Wow.

35:57.760 --> 36:00.320
You're leaving
for good?

36:00.370 --> 36:02.065
For good.

36:05.680 --> 36:08.467
OCS is something I've
been working toward,

36:08.510 --> 36:11.889
and... hey, you know,
maybe I don't make it through,

36:11.950 --> 36:16.592
but I... I got to figure out
if I have what it takes.

36:18.870 --> 36:20.826
If I've learned anything from...

36:20.870 --> 36:23.179
working with you guys, it's...

36:23.220 --> 36:25.120
being the best,

36:25.180 --> 36:27.171
you can't be
afraid to fail.

36:30.530 --> 36:32.225
Well...

36:32.270 --> 36:35.182
okay, you joking about this?

36:36.410 --> 36:38.366
I am not._I am
very serious.

36:38.410 --> 36:39.707
Cake-eater.

36:42.670 --> 36:46.231
All right, well,
what makes you think...

36:46.290 --> 36:48.679
you might not make it?

36:55.990 --> 36:58.641
You're gonna make it.

37:00.260 --> 37:01.989
You know what?

37:02.040 --> 37:04.258
I'm not gonna salute you.

37:04.300 --> 37:07.383
[laughter]

37:09.740 --> 37:13.221
[piano playing mellow jazz]

37:13.270 --> 37:15.875
You're quiet tonight.

37:15.920 --> 37:18.536
Yeah. I'm sorry.

37:18.580 --> 37:22.311
Adam never said much when he got
back from a spin-up, either.

37:24.670 --> 37:28.970
You know, if something happened
over there, I'm a good listener.

37:29.020 --> 37:33.059
I spent 18 years
being Adam's personal AAR.

37:41.300 --> 37:42.722
I, uh...

37:42.780 --> 37:44.645
Look”.

37:44.690 --> 37:47.818
I'm sorry, I, uh...

37:47.870 --> 37:51.783
I just can't get past the fact
that you're Adam's wife.

37:53.790 --> 37:56.782
On some level it makes sense
that we're out.

37:56.830 --> 37:59.958
I don't know, it-it's
just a little too weird.

38:04.360 --> 38:05.918
Yeah, I know.

38:05.970 --> 38:07.403
Yeah.

38:07.450 --> 38:10.328
I thought maybe...

38:12.330 --> 38:14.764
Eh, it doesn't matter.

38:14.810 --> 38:16.289
I say we finish
the wine.

38:16.330 --> 38:18.286
The wine. You know,
I'm not much

38:18.330 --> 38:20.412
of a wine guy,
but, uh,

38:20.470 --> 38:23.337
why don't we, uh,
switch it up

38:23.380 --> 38:24.335
just a little bit.

38:24.380 --> 38:25.642
Maybe...

38:25.690 --> 38:28.602
Hmm. What do you say?

38:28.650 --> 38:30.993
Why not, right?

38:36.830 --> 38:38.559
Hmm?

38:43.530 --> 38:45.794
Take some aspirin,

38:45.840 --> 38:47.228
Thanks.

38:47.280 --> 38:49.362
I could be nicer

38:49.410 --> 38:51.366
Might tell you lies Might tell you lies

38:51.410 --> 38:53.059
Might tell you stories

38:53.110 --> 38:54.884
I ain't got the time

38:54.940 --> 38:57.101
Ain't got the time I don't need the glory...

38:57.160 --> 38:59.378
You want to leave
at different times and...

38:59.420 --> 39:01.115
rendezvous later?

39:01.160 --> 39:02.980
[chuckles]I think I'm gonna stay

39:03.030 --> 39:04.986
and hang out with Clay
and Swanny a little bit.

39:05.030 --> 39:06.372
Mm-hmm.

39:06.430 --> 39:07.909
Tomorrow?

39:07.950 --> 39:09.599
Well, yeah, you know,

39:09.650 --> 39:12.813
it just hit me that
you're really leaving, huh?

39:12.870 --> 39:16.340
You hate that I'm gonna be
a cake-eater, don't you?

39:16.390 --> 39:18.176
Nah, Ijust...

39:18.220 --> 39:20.825
just hate that you're leaving.

39:20.880 --> 39:24.964
Didn't I tell you
there's so much more...

39:25.010 --> 39:26.614
Giddyup, little darlin'.

39:26.660 --> 39:29.094
Let's go.
[chuckles]

39:29.140 --> 39:33.019
For _us to see
than pain and misery

39:33.060 --> 39:36.530
Yeah, pain and misery...

39:36.590 --> 39:38.399
Nighty night.

39:39.680 --> 39:42.240
Pain and misery...

39:42.290 --> 39:46.192
You really think things would've
turned out different if...

39:46.250 --> 39:48.115
if you'd have taken the shot?

39:48.160 --> 39:49.559
Pain...

39:49.600 --> 39:51.556
Oh, man, don't I have
to think that way

39:51.600 --> 39:53.818
if I want to be the best?

39:53.860 --> 39:55.908
Coclq.

39:55.950 --> 39:58.862
Reminds me of Jason
when he first joined Bravo.

39:58.910 --> 40:00.559
And misery

40:00.610 --> 40:03.431
Look, I'm-I'm not saying
that I'm better than Ray.

40:03.480 --> 40:05.914
I'm more dialed in than he is.

40:05.960 --> 40:08.178
But Bravo's my
only focus now.

40:08.230 --> 40:10.004
I remember those days.

40:10.050 --> 40:12.359
Why'd you get out?

40:12.410 --> 40:15.880
It was just my time,
my time to go.

40:20.200 --> 40:22.452
You know,
maybe you make that shot,

40:22.500 --> 40:24.320
maybe you don't.

40:24.370 --> 40:26.418
But never question

40:26.460 --> 40:30.157
the decisions and commitment
of your brothers.

40:30.210 --> 40:32.770
Someday you'll realize...

40:32.820 --> 40:35.857
they're all you have
in this world.

40:37.300 --> 40:38.904
Pain

40:38.950 --> 40:41.168
And misery, baby

40:41.220 --> 40:43.120
Yeah, yeah

40:44.920 --> 40:48.879
No more pain and misery.

Hey, babe.
[clears throat]

40:58.840 --> 41:00.705
How was movie night?

41:00.760 --> 41:02.796
We missed you.
But it was great.

41:02.850 --> 41:04.533
Yeah?

41:04.590 --> 41:06.672
The kids are asleep now.

41:10.330 --> 41:12.321
I'm sorry I missed it.

41:12.380 --> 41:14.985
You don't _control
when a mi55ion ends.

41:21.170 --> 41:23.126
When'd you get back?

41:23.170 --> 41:25.422
A few hours ago.

41:25.480 --> 41:26.640
Mm.

41:26.700 --> 41:30.477
So you could
have been here, at home.

41:30.530 --> 41:32.828
But you were drinking, right?

41:35.620 --> 41:37.838
You're better
than this, Ray.

41:46.540 --> 41:48.144
Uh, yeah.

[clears throat]

I'm going to sleep

42:06.000 --> 42:09.515

42:09.570 --> 42:11.515
