WEBVTT

00:00.003 --> 00:01.741
Previously on X Company.

00:01.834 --> 00:02.744
I've been asked

00:02.805 --> 00:03.917
to bring a companion with me

00:04.019 --> 00:06.596
to the anniversary gala,
and I'd be honoured

00:06.700 --> 00:09.359
- if you would accompany me.
- That would be lovely.

00:09.462 --> 00:11.317
I'm leaving for Berlin
tomorrow to provide

00:11.399 --> 00:13.152
private security for Professor Voigt.

00:13.282 --> 00:16.318
Professor Karl Voigt
is working on a formula

00:16.352 --> 00:18.420
to increase the production
of synthetic oil.

00:18.454 --> 00:22.090
Soldiers are coming at 3 p.m.
It's gonna be an extermination.

00:22.125 --> 00:24.993
- Mama!
- Where are you taking her?

00:25.028 --> 00:27.288
- Are you proud of what you've done?
- I didn't fight.

00:27.371 --> 00:29.798
You are the one who made
the children orphans.

00:29.832 --> 00:31.366
You're the monster.

00:32.359 --> 00:35.003
I would like you to meet Dagna.

00:35.038 --> 00:38.640
She needs a family.
I think she will be very happy here.

00:38.675 --> 00:41.843
- How do you live with yourself?
- You want me to say that I'm a monster,

00:41.878 --> 00:43.979
is that it?
Your hands aren't clean either.

00:44.013 --> 00:46.048
You're just like me.

00:51.054 --> 00:53.055
S03E08
Naqam

00:53.217 --> 00:56.309
sync and corrected by ninh
www.addic7ed.com

00:58.661 --> 01:01.129
So the celebrations are gonna
last three days. Schmidt is

01:01.164 --> 01:03.165
gonna keep Voigt hidden
until he receives his award.

01:03.199 --> 01:05.033
- Which Himmler's presenting?
- Yeah.

01:05.068 --> 01:07.302
Bloody hell. RSD will be all over him.

01:07.336 --> 01:09.404
We need to find a way to
isolate Voigt from bodyguards.

01:09.439 --> 01:11.406
And then what? You'll need a weapon.

01:11.441 --> 01:13.542
Event like that,
they'll be frisking the toothpicks.

01:13.576 --> 01:16.699
Camp X is working on it.
And we've got Faber on our side.

01:17.009 --> 01:19.147
Schmidt gave me a ticket
for the 7:50 train.

01:19.182 --> 01:20.849
- You can arrange it?
- It's the only train to Berlin

01:20.883 --> 01:24.086
- this week; we can't miss it.
- I need papers for that border.

01:24.120 --> 01:26.416
Do you still have a copy of your photo?

01:27.790 --> 01:30.025
I'll try and take care of it at work.

01:30.059 --> 01:33.228
Meet me at the station. Noon sharp.

01:33.262 --> 01:35.219
We'll get there.

01:35.425 --> 01:37.265
We're doing it again, aren't we?

01:37.300 --> 01:40.335
Walking away from a battle?
Leaving them empty-handed?

01:40.369 --> 01:42.763
Not empty-handed.

01:43.753 --> 01:46.252
I smuggled this out of the office.

01:46.891 --> 01:50.312
- You smuggled a tourist map?
- Hold it up to the light.

01:52.642 --> 01:54.916
"Maly Dolek, Jezyna Dolina,

01:54.951 --> 01:57.018
- Mala Wioska."
- These are the villages

01:57.053 --> 01:59.621
and towns selected for
upcoming purging actions.

01:59.655 --> 02:02.190
I couldn't take the list,
but I borrowed it long enough

02:02.225 --> 02:03.892
to poke a few holes.

02:03.926 --> 02:06.394
- This'll give Zosia's crew a leg up.
- Yeah.

02:06.930 --> 02:09.362
Are you all right?

02:09.866 --> 02:11.967
I'll see you at noon.

02:18.141 --> 02:20.803
Morning, ladies. Heidi.

02:21.999 --> 02:23.812
I'm so glad you're here, Helene.

02:27.083 --> 02:28.988
Is everything all right?

02:31.154 --> 02:34.089
After the trouble in Nadzieja,
I came back

02:34.123 --> 02:36.091
to the office last night to
deal with some paperwork.

02:36.125 --> 02:38.960
The light was on in Faber's office.

02:39.357 --> 02:41.212
I heard voices.

02:42.999 --> 02:45.200
He was in there with a woman.

02:46.655 --> 02:48.258
If he was,

02:48.361 --> 02:52.274
it's none of my business, Heidi.
Or yours.

02:53.329 --> 02:54.875
You know the Fabers well.

02:54.957 --> 02:57.846
I wanted to ask your advice.

02:57.880 --> 02:59.848
Do you think I should tell Sabine

02:59.882 --> 03:02.284
her husband's having an affair?

03:02.318 --> 03:04.686
You heard voices,

03:04.720 --> 03:07.823
talking. Is that an affair?

03:07.857 --> 03:10.592
I saw her leave the office in a hurry.

03:10.626 --> 03:12.427
I saw her.

03:12.461 --> 03:15.163
So, someone talked to him

03:15.198 --> 03:17.642
and walked away.

03:18.634 --> 03:20.669
I don't know.

03:20.703 --> 03:22.671
Do you really want to hurt my friend,

03:22.705 --> 03:24.840
the Brigadefuhrer's wife,

03:24.874 --> 03:28.677
for just... gossip?

03:32.012 --> 03:33.648
Of course not.

03:36.586 --> 03:38.553
Why don't you let me
take this off your mind?

03:40.000 --> 03:46.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:06.828 --> 04:08.817
Where have you been?

04:08.851 --> 04:11.152
You just left.

04:11.187 --> 04:15.053
I didn't know if you were coming back,
or if you were even safe.

04:15.300 --> 04:17.358
Sorry.

04:17.815 --> 04:20.595
It was all so sudden. I needed to think.

04:20.630 --> 04:22.597
And you never came back?

04:22.632 --> 04:24.599
I got drawn into an urgent meeting.

04:24.634 --> 04:27.235
The kind I can't say no to.

04:27.270 --> 04:30.205
I slept at the office...
Didn't want to wake you.

04:34.760 --> 04:36.635
What about her?

04:42.655 --> 04:44.953
We'll arrange for a nanny.

04:45.355 --> 04:47.889
Why? She isn't staying.

04:51.694 --> 04:55.130
I won't have that child in my house.
You have to send her away.

04:55.164 --> 04:57.248
If I could do this for you, I would.

04:57.351 --> 05:00.101
But the fact is we can't
defy your father. Not now.

05:00.814 --> 05:02.604
We're supposed to just keep her?

05:02.638 --> 05:04.572
I can't explain.
It's a very sensitive time,

05:04.607 --> 05:06.541
I can't afford to antagonize him.

05:06.575 --> 05:09.644
You won't for once stand
up for yourself? Or for me?

05:09.679 --> 05:11.413
It's not that simple.

05:11.447 --> 05:13.648
You always do what you're told

05:13.683 --> 05:17.161
no matter what the cost,
no matter what it does to your family.

05:27.015 --> 05:28.458
Bread

05:28.602 --> 05:30.165
and jam.

05:41.507 --> 05:43.979
It's raspberry.

05:44.013 --> 05:46.081
It's good.

06:01.197 --> 06:03.631
Karolina, Lucasz.

06:03.666 --> 06:06.201
These need to be cleaned
and tested for damage,

06:06.235 --> 06:08.870
just like Janowski would have wanted.

06:12.908 --> 06:15.250
It's good. Keeping them busy,

06:15.683 --> 06:17.712
focused.

06:17.747 --> 06:19.714
I hope that doesn't mean

06:19.749 --> 06:22.117
what I'm afraid it does?

06:22.857 --> 06:24.794
We're going to Berlin.

06:25.227 --> 06:26.955
Berlin?

06:27.330 --> 06:28.957
That's very brave.

06:29.371 --> 06:31.826
And very stupid.

06:32.153 --> 06:34.362
Janowski would have loved it.

06:37.288 --> 06:39.501
It will be hard to find someone like him

06:39.535 --> 06:41.569
to lead them.

06:41.604 --> 06:43.671
I don't know.

06:43.706 --> 06:45.707
I think they have their leader.

06:48.711 --> 06:50.845
I have something for you.

06:53.449 --> 06:55.950
Hold it up to the light,
you'll see where the Germans

06:55.985 --> 06:58.520
have planned their attacks.

06:58.554 --> 07:01.199
There's a code on the bottom;
tells you order they'll be hit.

07:03.325 --> 07:06.161
We'll be waiting for them.

07:06.195 --> 07:09.497
I thought you might be able to use this.

07:09.532 --> 07:12.000
It's a bit battered, but it works.

07:12.034 --> 07:14.402
This radio's got us
through some scrapes.

07:14.437 --> 07:16.971
He'd be glad to know it's
helping the right people.

07:21.915 --> 07:24.451
We'll take good care of it.

07:27.769 --> 07:29.617
Good morning.

07:33.589 --> 07:36.291
Herr Brigadefuhrer.

07:36.325 --> 07:39.194
Fraulein Adler! At once!

08:37.720 --> 08:40.020
- Brigadefuhrer.
- After my debrief

08:40.054 --> 08:42.023
with Goetschl, I need to meet
with Obergruppenfuhrer Schmidt

08:42.057 --> 08:44.592
at his home. Have you prepared
for my travel to Berlin?

08:44.627 --> 08:47.028
- Yes, sir.
- Good. I'll be out of the office

08:47.062 --> 08:49.664
- for the rest of the day.
- I found him,

08:49.698 --> 08:53.001
Squadron Leader William Sinclair

08:53.035 --> 08:55.303
in a Japanese POW camp.
He's being transferred

08:55.337 --> 08:58.206
to Berlin by air as we speak.

08:58.240 --> 09:00.241
Well done, Matthias.

09:02.578 --> 09:05.313
The prisoner...

09:05.347 --> 09:07.348
he's Colonel Sinclair's son, isn't he?

09:08.405 --> 09:10.885
I've been reviewing all our
information on his operatives.

09:10.920 --> 09:12.887
Keep an eye on the prisoner transfer.

09:12.922 --> 09:15.089
Don't worry about anything beyond that.

09:17.393 --> 09:19.360
I'm looking forward to
seeing what you've got

09:19.395 --> 09:22.397
up your sleeve this time.

09:27.169 --> 09:29.704
Three days of celebration.

09:29.738 --> 09:32.073
There will be public concerts,

09:32.107 --> 09:34.142
the theatre. Even films.

09:34.176 --> 09:36.778
I'm sure little Dagna here would enjoy

09:36.812 --> 09:39.180
her first motion
picture in the big city.

09:42.818 --> 09:44.886
Have you ever seen fireworks?

09:44.920 --> 09:47.113
Haha!

09:48.226 --> 09:49.690
Still shy.

09:49.834 --> 09:52.594
It's perfectly normal.

09:54.390 --> 09:56.931
Such a beauty, isn't she?

09:57.915 --> 10:00.401
Those eyes remind me
of yours at that age.

10:00.436 --> 10:03.441
I knew right away she
was the one for you.

10:05.541 --> 10:07.408
That was very thoughtful of you,

10:07.443 --> 10:09.377
but the truth is I'm not ready

10:09.411 --> 10:11.246
- to be a mother again.
- Don't be silly.

10:11.280 --> 10:13.459
You're an excellent mother.

10:16.015 --> 10:19.721
What about ice cream?
You ever had ice cream?

10:19.755 --> 10:21.990
I'm sorry, Papa. It's just too soon.

10:22.024 --> 10:24.592
You can't dwell on unfortunate events

10:24.627 --> 10:27.699
forever, Sabine. You have to move on.

10:28.029 --> 10:29.264
Not every woman

10:29.298 --> 10:32.267
is this lucky to have a
child with such excellent

10:32.301 --> 10:34.035
Germanic traits.

10:34.069 --> 10:38.273
Please, take her back.

10:38.542 --> 10:40.275
Where should I take her back to?

10:40.309 --> 10:43.211
To where she came from. To her family.

10:43.245 --> 10:47.115
- She has no family.
- How does she have no family?

10:51.920 --> 10:53.888
If you want a prettier girl,

10:53.922 --> 10:56.758
or a younger girl,
or a little boy; that's fine.

10:56.792 --> 10:59.993
There will be an ample supply
from this area soon enough.

11:02.598 --> 11:05.767
Yes. Send a truck right away, please.

11:05.801 --> 11:08.102
I have an item for disposal.

11:08.137 --> 11:09.771
"Disposal"?

11:09.805 --> 11:12.674
That's right, just one. Fifteen minutes?

11:12.708 --> 11:16.277
Wait! I'll keep her. She's perfect!

11:16.312 --> 11:19.147
I'll keep her!

11:19.181 --> 11:21.115
Good.

11:23.686 --> 11:25.219
Come here.

11:26.955 --> 11:28.923
What did you just call her?

11:28.957 --> 11:31.826
You're a big girl now, Sabine.

11:31.860 --> 11:34.862
It's time you stopped being sentimental.

11:34.897 --> 11:37.198
Some people have value; some don't.

11:37.232 --> 11:39.500
It's a scientific fact.

11:39.535 --> 11:41.769
The Reich is rebuilding;

11:41.804 --> 11:43.971
we can't afford to waste food

11:44.006 --> 11:46.441
and resources on parasites.

11:46.475 --> 11:50.109
Are you calling your
grandson a parasite?

11:53.242 --> 11:54.782
Papa.

11:54.817 --> 11:57.118
Ulli was an aberration.

11:57.152 --> 11:59.654
- You don't believe that.
- I have indulged you

11:59.688 --> 12:01.656
long enough. It's for the best

12:01.690 --> 12:03.991
the child is dead. He was a weed.

12:05.594 --> 12:08.863
So this is what it is now? To be German?

12:08.897 --> 12:11.466
After everything we've endured...

12:11.500 --> 12:13.668
to be finally proud?

12:14.020 --> 12:15.703
Yes!

12:18.226 --> 12:20.408
I'll find a way, Papa,

12:20.442 --> 12:22.443
to be proud.

12:30.686 --> 12:33.888
I'll see myself out. I'm a big girl now.

12:37.059 --> 12:39.494
Polizeifuhre, Fraulein Adler.

12:39.528 --> 12:42.330
Obviously,
yesterday was not a day to be proud of.

12:42.364 --> 12:44.499
The Resistance clearly
knew the action was coming.

12:44.533 --> 12:47.902
They had inside information,
which means the leak

12:47.936 --> 12:50.271
among the Jewish workers in
the office was not caught

12:50.305 --> 12:51.906
quickly enough.

12:51.940 --> 12:53.841
I never wanted them
here in the first place.

12:53.876 --> 12:55.943
But I assure you,
Herr Brigadefuhrer, Fraulein Adlr

12:55.978 --> 12:58.246
has been reprimanded
and relieved of her more

12:58.280 --> 13:00.047
sensitive duties.

13:00.082 --> 13:02.583
The Resistance may have had
prior knowledge of the action,

13:02.618 --> 13:04.585
but they were still surprised.

13:04.620 --> 13:06.521
With the recent attacks to the trains,

13:06.555 --> 13:08.222
I had the troops rerouted to arrive

13:08.257 --> 13:11.459
- in Nadzieja by truck instead.
- I don't need coddling.

13:11.493 --> 13:13.895
The rail movements were secure.
Only Fraulein Adler

13:13.929 --> 13:15.897
and myself knew when the
troop train would arrive.

13:15.931 --> 13:18.599
This morning,
explosives were found on the tracks.

13:18.634 --> 13:21.369
Without my precautions, many more
German soldiers could have been killed.

13:22.456 --> 13:24.779
Well, it's a... it's a wise move,

13:25.026 --> 13:26.441
Herr Brigadefuhrer.

13:26.922 --> 13:29.977
Ahem! Ja.

13:30.012 --> 13:33.414
Train to Krakow now boarding on track 2.

13:33.449 --> 13:36.417
All passengers going to Krakow,

13:36.452 --> 13:38.653
now boarding on track 2.

13:43.892 --> 13:48.175
I wanted to apologize,
Helene, for earlier.

13:48.546 --> 13:50.965
Yesterday's actions
didn't go so smoothly.

13:50.999 --> 13:54.957
I'm a perfectionist, and failure doesn't
always bring out my best qualities.

13:56.638 --> 13:58.506
I'm sorry I let my own bad mood

13:58.540 --> 14:01.017
cloud my judgment about
the Brigadefuhrer.

14:01.615 --> 14:04.604
But I would hate for there
to be tension between us.

14:05.327 --> 14:08.249
Yesterday was upsetting for everyone.

14:08.283 --> 14:11.285
I know you meant no offense. Hmm.

14:13.021 --> 14:15.122
I'm going to take a walk
for lunch to clear my head.

14:15.157 --> 14:17.124
- That sounds lovely.
- Yeah.

14:17.159 --> 14:19.260
Could you help me with something first?

14:19.819 --> 14:22.530
These need to be stored
in the basement archives,

14:22.564 --> 14:25.158
and the door's so heavy,
I can't do it alone.

14:25.405 --> 14:26.701
Of course.

14:45.754 --> 14:47.455
Get in the cell. Now!

14:47.489 --> 14:50.458
Heidi, this is...
What's gotten into you?

14:50.492 --> 14:53.761
Sharing military information
with the Resistance,

14:53.795 --> 14:56.230
seducing your way into
the inner circles,

14:56.265 --> 14:58.266
and now forging papers.

15:04.840 --> 15:07.241
Is this one of your compatriots?

15:07.276 --> 15:10.611
Yesterday has upset you.
You're not thinking rationally.

15:10.646 --> 15:12.914
I already know it's true.

15:13.821 --> 15:15.635
You're a spy.

15:20.112 --> 15:22.213
You're... you're confused.

15:22.248 --> 15:24.249
I mean, this is not what you think.

15:24.283 --> 15:27.151
You're the only other person,
other than Goetschl and myself,

15:27.186 --> 15:29.754
who thought the troops were
arriving in Nadzieja by train.

15:29.788 --> 15:33.157
But somehow, the Resistance knew
to set explosives on the rails.

15:33.192 --> 15:35.094
Resistance has been attacking
trains long before I arrived.

15:35.176 --> 15:37.228
I thought it was just social grasping

15:37.263 --> 15:39.898
when you threw yourself
at the Obergruppenfuhrer.

15:39.932 --> 15:42.033
You wouldn't be the first.

15:42.068 --> 15:45.904
But then I see you carrying
on with his son-in-law too.

15:45.938 --> 15:48.206
Well, that tells a more serious story.

15:49.997 --> 15:52.243
Give me your wrists.

15:53.646 --> 15:55.313
- Fine.
- No!

15:57.950 --> 15:59.918
Here.

16:03.522 --> 16:05.924
Goetschl is always
trying to discredit me,

16:05.958 --> 16:09.027
blame me for his mistakes.

16:09.061 --> 16:11.062
But if I bring him a traitor,

16:11.097 --> 16:13.498
someone working right under his nose,

16:13.532 --> 16:16.968
that will wipe the smile
off the mule's face.

16:17.003 --> 16:19.671
Until he takes all the credit.

16:19.705 --> 16:21.673
Or worse,

16:21.707 --> 16:24.442
blames you for hiring a
spy in the first place.

16:24.477 --> 16:26.745
I'll go over his head.

16:29.515 --> 16:31.850
No one will care if I bring in two.

16:35.855 --> 16:39.357
It's time for you to talk, Helene.

16:42.305 --> 16:44.763
- Where is she?
- It's not like her.

16:45.376 --> 16:46.931
Faber works in the same office;

16:46.966 --> 16:49.415
maybe he can tell us if she's there.

16:54.206 --> 16:56.775
So, you know where to go?

16:56.809 --> 16:58.629
Yes.

16:59.178 --> 17:01.379
Here's an extra Groschen

17:01.414 --> 17:03.982
- to go as fast as you can. Go!
- I will.

17:24.436 --> 17:26.738
Who was that man you were talking to?

17:32.100 --> 17:33.934
I'll take it from here.

17:39.785 --> 17:42.120
Who's the man in the photo?

17:43.582 --> 17:46.262
Who else are you working with?

17:46.692 --> 17:49.694
How long have you been
targeting Franz Faber?

17:49.729 --> 17:51.830
I'll shoot if I have to.

17:54.366 --> 17:58.036
What about Obergrupperfuhrer Schmidt?
Hm?

17:58.070 --> 18:00.071
What are your intentions with him?

18:00.106 --> 18:01.439
Hmm?

18:11.550 --> 18:14.586
How do you live with yourself?

18:15.759 --> 18:17.856
Fraulein Adler?

18:17.890 --> 18:20.058
Polizeifuhrer Goetschl
is asking for you.

18:20.092 --> 18:22.227
I'll be right there!

19:01.634 --> 19:03.601
He didn't show.

19:03.636 --> 19:05.603
It was a red envelope.

19:05.638 --> 19:08.573
- He knows what that means.
- Something's wrong.

19:08.607 --> 19:11.009
- Or he's not there.
- I could go

19:11.043 --> 19:13.711
into the office as Alec,
tell them I'm looking for a permit.

19:13.746 --> 19:15.680
No, you'll draw too much attention.

19:15.714 --> 19:18.306
And what if something is wrong?

19:18.966 --> 19:21.452
We need a friend.

19:23.823 --> 19:25.790
Isn't it risky, you just walking up

19:25.825 --> 19:27.792
- to our house like this?
- No.

19:27.827 --> 19:29.694
I work at the train station.

19:29.728 --> 19:31.596
Officially, I'm just bringing
you your tickets for tonight.

19:31.630 --> 19:33.598
- "Officially"?
- I need your help.

19:33.632 --> 19:35.767
- Has something happened?
- There's no danger,

19:35.801 --> 19:38.369
but I need you to go to the Race and
Resettlement office to find Aurora.

19:38.404 --> 19:40.718
- Is she all right?
- That's what we need to know.

19:40.842 --> 19:42.511
My friend will be looking for you.

19:44.367 --> 19:46.778
I can't leave Dagna alone.

19:47.005 --> 19:48.489
Who's Dagna?

19:53.086 --> 19:54.853
She... she was brought here

19:54.887 --> 19:56.888
for adoption.

19:56.922 --> 19:59.290
But she's scared and
just won't come out.

20:08.500 --> 20:10.702
Dagna?

20:17.209 --> 20:19.377
Hello, Dagna. My name's Alec.

20:19.411 --> 20:21.379
I work in the train station.

20:21.413 --> 20:23.414
I came to bring this lady her tickets,
and she says

20:23.449 --> 20:25.450
maybe you're scared.

20:27.755 --> 20:30.002
I only know her a little bit,

20:30.290 --> 20:33.491
but I already know she's very kind.

20:34.764 --> 20:36.628
Dagna,

20:36.662 --> 20:39.497
I'll tell you a secret.

20:39.531 --> 20:41.499
Do you know what my job was

20:41.533 --> 20:44.168
before the train station?

20:44.203 --> 20:46.771
I used to be an entertainer

20:46.805 --> 20:48.873
at the theatre.

20:48.908 --> 20:51.009
And I had a magician friend

20:51.043 --> 20:53.478
who showed me a trick.

20:53.512 --> 20:56.114
I can show you if you want.

20:58.219 --> 21:00.184
He used a coin

21:00.219 --> 21:01.586
like this.

21:01.620 --> 21:03.521
See? But

21:03.555 --> 21:05.908
he was better at it than me.

21:06.733 --> 21:08.259
I'm very clumsy.

21:08.294 --> 21:11.329
I'm always dropping things.

21:13.432 --> 21:15.066
I'll watch her.

21:15.100 --> 21:17.101
Please go see if Aurora's all right.

21:20.252 --> 21:21.739
Ania.

21:28.514 --> 21:31.950
Would you like me to
teach you the trick?

21:34.620 --> 21:36.331
Sabine?

21:36.558 --> 21:39.223
Oh, hello! I came to see Helene.
Is she here?

21:39.258 --> 21:42.427
I haven't seen her.
She must be late from lunch.

21:43.829 --> 21:46.965
- How is little Dagna settling in?
- She's fine.

21:46.999 --> 21:50.501
Must be so hard for you.
A new child in the house,

21:50.536 --> 21:52.503
especially when you're on your own.

21:52.538 --> 21:54.339
"On my own"?

21:54.373 --> 21:56.341
While your husband is here at night,

21:56.375 --> 21:59.310
having secret meetings.

21:59.345 --> 22:01.312
It must make things harder for you.

22:01.347 --> 22:03.481
I don't know what you mean by "secret."

22:03.515 --> 22:05.583
Franz does whatever needs to be done

22:05.617 --> 22:07.919
for the security of the Reich,
to keep us all safe.

22:07.953 --> 22:10.421
I don't question what
his job demands of him,

22:10.456 --> 22:13.091
and I can't imagine anyone else would,
either.

22:13.125 --> 22:16.661
Of course.
We all appreciate his sacrifices.

22:16.695 --> 22:18.529
Will you tell Helene I was here?

22:18.564 --> 22:20.264
I will.

22:34.747 --> 22:36.147
Sabine.

22:36.181 --> 22:38.983
It's OK, I'm a friend of Aurora's.

22:39.018 --> 22:40.985
- Did you find her?
- Mmmm. Her purse

22:41.020 --> 22:43.612
was at her desk,
but Heidi said she was away for lunch.

22:43.838 --> 22:45.523
She was also asking about Franz,

22:45.557 --> 22:48.226
about his "secret meetings."
He wasn't inside either.

22:48.260 --> 22:50.261
Something's wrong.

22:52.231 --> 22:54.532
Don't worry about it. We'll find them.

22:54.566 --> 22:57.035
Go on home.
There's nothing more you can do.

23:07.780 --> 23:11.249
Your good friend Sabine...

23:11.283 --> 23:14.052
she's either incredibly naive

23:14.086 --> 23:16.554
about her husband's secrets or,

23:16.588 --> 23:19.023
I don't know,

23:19.058 --> 23:21.526
perhaps she's hiding something too.

23:25.080 --> 23:28.966
I remember when I was a girl
in the Bund Deutscher Madel.

23:30.969 --> 23:34.672
Nothing was more important than loyalty,

23:34.706 --> 23:36.841
bravery,

23:36.875 --> 23:38.643
strength.

23:40.646 --> 23:42.747
And we were so committed,

23:42.781 --> 23:45.611
the instructors didn't even
need to weed out the weak.

23:46.819 --> 23:48.786
We did that ourselves.

23:48.821 --> 23:51.856
Late at night, in our rooms,

23:51.890 --> 23:54.559
we'd test each other.

23:54.593 --> 23:56.961
We'd take a spike,

23:56.995 --> 23:59.361
just like this...

24:03.802 --> 24:05.770
and push it

24:05.804 --> 24:07.772
into a girl's arm

24:07.806 --> 24:09.807
very slowly...

24:11.810 --> 24:14.412
to see how long she could take it.

24:16.782 --> 24:19.750
All you have to do is talk.

24:27.282 --> 24:28.775
Let's try this again.

24:28.878 --> 24:31.640
What is your purpose here?

24:32.320 --> 24:33.970
Does Franz Faber know you are a spy?

24:34.073 --> 24:36.814
- Please! Please stop.
- What is your real

24:36.897 --> 24:39.293
- purpose in Poland? Tell me!
- Please, just stop!

24:39.327 --> 24:41.629
Stop, stop.
Please, I'll talk, I'll talk.

24:41.663 --> 24:43.797
Oh! Ah!

24:50.693 --> 24:53.146
This is just my first assignment.

24:54.509 --> 24:56.477
I was sent to Paris to develop

24:56.511 --> 24:58.479
trust with Faber through his wife.

24:58.513 --> 25:00.614
So she's not a real friend?

25:00.649 --> 25:03.050
I made friends with her
to get closer to him.

25:03.084 --> 25:05.052
But neither of them knows this.

25:05.086 --> 25:07.021
Last night, with him,

25:07.055 --> 25:10.557
it wasn't business.

25:10.592 --> 25:13.179
I mean, not for him.

25:13.364 --> 25:14.895
He's not a traitor.

25:14.929 --> 25:17.879
You're spying on him
to help the Resistance.

25:18.497 --> 25:21.001
Why? Why would you do that?

25:21.036 --> 25:24.705
Money. It's a long story.

25:24.739 --> 25:27.474
- So you have a boss, a...
- A handler, yes.

25:27.509 --> 25:29.510
Someone in town?

25:32.747 --> 25:34.332
How many of you are there here?

25:34.374 --> 25:36.703
Heidi, if you promise to let me go

25:36.785 --> 25:40.487
and not to report me,
I will give you their names.

25:40.522 --> 25:42.356
- Names?
- I can call

25:42.390 --> 25:44.992
an emergency meeting through a contact.
All the local agents

25:45.026 --> 25:47.294
will meet.
They're much more significant than I am.

25:47.328 --> 25:50.097
They're professionals. Heidi,

25:50.131 --> 25:53.500
I'll cooperate completely.
I would give you the money

25:53.535 --> 25:56.370
as long as you let me go.

26:03.078 --> 26:06.613
If you gather your colleagues

26:06.648 --> 26:08.549
I promise I will let you go.

26:11.019 --> 26:13.954
Thank you. Thank you.

26:44.257 --> 26:45.848
Good afternoon.

26:53.228 --> 26:55.963
Would it be possible to buy two tickets

26:55.997 --> 26:57.965
and leave them under a friend's name?

26:58.381 --> 27:00.667
Of course.

27:00.702 --> 27:03.337
The name is Bijou.

27:04.807 --> 27:07.708
I'm arranging a birthday party for him,

27:07.742 --> 27:10.177
and he needs to arrive in Pomoc

27:10.211 --> 27:14.454
- at 3 p.m. sharp.
- Pomoc at 3 p.m.

27:14.866 --> 27:16.577
Thank you.

27:56.858 --> 27:59.026
3 p.m. sharp.

27:59.060 --> 28:01.195
Write this down.

28:01.229 --> 28:04.565
Just west of Pomoc,
down the road from the cemetery

28:04.599 --> 28:07.234
in a hut with a metal
roof and green windows.

28:07.268 --> 28:09.436
There'll be at least
three of them there.

28:09.470 --> 28:11.471
Saboteurs.

28:11.506 --> 28:13.841
Members of an underground cell.

28:13.875 --> 28:17.177
And they're probably armed,
so be prepared.

28:17.212 --> 28:19.246
Good.

28:52.313 --> 28:54.281
I did what I promised.
You promised you'd...

28:54.315 --> 28:57.284
Let you go? We're going to
Obergruppenfuhrer Schmidt's house

28:57.318 --> 29:00.587
where I will deliver a traitor.

29:18.306 --> 29:21.541
A woman of your background,
your education,

29:21.576 --> 29:23.911
how you could turn your
back on our people?

29:23.945 --> 29:26.580
Sell your body to the enemy?

29:26.614 --> 29:28.782
And your colleagues, all German too?

29:28.816 --> 29:30.784
They consider themselves patriots.

29:30.818 --> 29:32.386
- Patriots?
- Yes.

29:32.420 --> 29:34.655
They say that Hitler's
Germany is not their Germany.

29:34.689 --> 29:36.957
What are you doing?

29:36.991 --> 29:39.092
- I'm not doing anything.
- Keep driving!

29:39.127 --> 29:40.928
I can't, we're running out of gas.

29:40.962 --> 29:43.563
- Don't lie to me!
- Please don't!

29:43.598 --> 29:46.099
Don't shoot. Just look for yourself!

30:57.492 --> 30:59.735
No!

31:02.022 --> 31:03.260
Heidi,

31:03.343 --> 31:06.455
I want you to know

31:06.558 --> 31:10.329
that you were killed by a Jew.

31:43.184 --> 31:45.165
What happened?

31:45.534 --> 31:47.018
She, um,

31:47.059 --> 31:48.976
she found me out.

31:49.100 --> 31:52.539
And she was about to
expose us so I stopped her.

31:52.573 --> 31:54.541
The operation is safe.

31:57.421 --> 32:00.046
Thank you.

32:04.141 --> 32:06.347
What do we do with this?

32:06.491 --> 32:09.377
Same thing she did to all her victims.

32:10.531 --> 32:12.717
The mass grave's not far.

32:24.773 --> 32:27.741
Listen, why am I being kept waiting?
My appointment

32:27.776 --> 32:29.724
was 20 minutes ago.

32:30.342 --> 32:32.280
I apologize, Herr Brigadefuhrer.

32:32.363 --> 32:35.182
The Obergruppenfuhrer
is still in his meeting.

32:35.818 --> 32:37.918
Let's buy a ticket in Heidi's name.

32:37.952 --> 32:39.364
Somewhere neutral like Spain?

32:39.446 --> 32:41.889
I'll courier a ticket to her desk.

32:41.923 --> 32:43.157
It'll look like she was
trying to get out of town.

32:43.322 --> 32:45.859
Right after sending German
soldiers into an ambush.

32:45.894 --> 32:48.095
- That won't look good on her.
- You got your tickets

32:48.129 --> 32:50.495
- for the train tonight?
- Yeah.

32:51.266 --> 32:53.867
Can I ask you something?

32:53.902 --> 32:55.569
Yeah.

32:58.006 --> 32:59.973
You're sure you're OK?

33:00.008 --> 33:01.983
Mm.

33:03.311 --> 33:05.694
Good.

33:06.024 --> 33:07.314
How did it happen?

33:07.348 --> 33:09.616
How did Heidi figure
out you were an agent?

33:11.953 --> 33:13.733
Just one thing led to another.

33:13.816 --> 33:16.423
She started asking questions

33:19.307 --> 33:22.482
Because she thought Faber
and I were having an affair.

33:22.864 --> 33:24.998
But why would she think that?

33:28.151 --> 33:30.637
Because she saw us together last night.

33:30.672 --> 33:32.739
But you were with us up at the camp.

33:32.774 --> 33:34.775
We were talking.

33:34.809 --> 33:37.811
It was after that.

33:37.846 --> 33:39.780
What did she see?

33:41.628 --> 33:44.251
Just don't make me say it.

33:49.390 --> 33:51.124
What are you doing here?

33:51.159 --> 33:52.960
Franz, come in.

34:06.341 --> 34:08.342
Take a look at this.

34:20.522 --> 34:23.790
Your young colleague had his eyes open.

34:23.824 --> 34:26.560
This man is in Pruszko

34:26.594 --> 34:29.663
as we speak. A civilian.

34:29.697 --> 34:32.331
But Untersturmfuhr
Edsel clearly remembers

34:32.367 --> 34:34.701
seeing him in German uniform

34:34.735 --> 34:37.371
at your promotion party in Paris.

34:39.841 --> 34:43.076
And now, he has proof

34:43.110 --> 34:46.150
of a covert communication
between you two.

34:59.294 --> 35:03.263
You are a traitor,

35:03.878 --> 35:06.867
a double agent.

35:15.140 --> 35:16.974
No.

35:18.627 --> 35:21.712
The Allies only think
I'm a double agent.

35:24.749 --> 35:26.934
- What are you saying?
- A cell of Allied spies

35:27.017 --> 35:29.762
tried to recruit me in Paris.

35:29.906 --> 35:33.191
I saw it as an opportunity
to learn everything I could

35:33.225 --> 35:35.260
about the enemy.

35:35.294 --> 35:37.629
Over the last few weeks, I have been

35:37.663 --> 35:39.831
"working" with them,
but it has been calculated

35:39.865 --> 35:42.667
to slowly earn their trust,
to lower their defenses.

35:42.701 --> 35:45.970
It has so far been very effective.

35:47.973 --> 35:50.458
Edsel, give us the room.

35:56.649 --> 35:58.616
If this is the case,

35:58.651 --> 36:01.553
why did you say nothing?
I brought you here

36:01.587 --> 36:04.122
to protect Operation Marigold,
and if you were doing

36:04.156 --> 36:06.591
something like this, I needed to know.

36:06.625 --> 36:08.660
With respect, I disagree.

36:08.694 --> 36:10.662
Cultivating a relationship

36:10.696 --> 36:12.664
with spies is a delicate process.

36:12.698 --> 36:15.700
Your area of expertise is energy,
not intelligence.

36:15.734 --> 36:19.470
You worry about your oil;
I'll worry about the spies.

36:19.505 --> 36:21.806
What about the agents

36:21.841 --> 36:24.542
that sabotaged the Czarna refinery?

36:24.577 --> 36:26.511
A calculated move to keep their trust.

36:26.545 --> 36:29.981
When you wouldn't tell me
which refinery Professor Voigt

36:30.015 --> 36:31.983
was operating from,
I tracked down the information myself.

36:32.017 --> 36:34.319
- How?
- Your vehicle logs.

36:34.353 --> 36:37.722
I saw you were only travelling to Ryba,

36:37.756 --> 36:39.991
so I sent the agents to Czarna
where I could capture them

36:40.025 --> 36:42.627
and keep Professor
Voigt off their radar.

36:42.661 --> 36:45.964
If the Allies are
targeting oil production,

36:45.998 --> 36:49.400
surely they will send more to
replace the ones you captured.

36:49.435 --> 36:51.402
You may not be seeing
the bigger picture here.

36:51.437 --> 36:54.239
It doesn't matter how many
individual agents I arrest

36:54.273 --> 36:56.641
and question,
the Allies will always send more.

36:56.675 --> 36:59.577
The only way to pay
off the long-term game

36:59.612 --> 37:01.512
is to secure the man who's sending

37:01.547 --> 37:03.514
those spies from overseas,

37:03.549 --> 37:06.751
the man who knows more than
they all know, combined.

37:09.255 --> 37:11.723
Colonel Duncan Sinclair.

37:11.757 --> 37:14.192
How do you plan to do that?

37:14.226 --> 37:17.228
He will come to me

37:17.263 --> 37:19.497
because Sinclair trusts me.

37:22.607 --> 37:25.436
And I have his son.

37:38.617 --> 37:40.585
What's the word?

37:40.619 --> 37:44.022
The ambush raised questions.
They couldn't find her at home,

37:44.056 --> 37:46.391
and I hid a few fake
papers in her drawer.

37:46.425 --> 37:48.426
- Nice.
- Now Goetschl is telling

37:48.460 --> 37:50.428
everyone that he knew it...

37:50.462 --> 37:53.264
that Heidi was working with
the Resistance all along.

37:53.299 --> 37:55.934
But he was onto her,
and that's why she got scared

37:55.968 --> 37:58.469
- and tried to flee to Spain.
- So we're not exposed.

37:58.504 --> 38:00.939
For now.

38:01.962 --> 38:03.694
Where's Alfred?

38:03.879 --> 38:04.909
He had some things to wrap up.

38:04.944 --> 38:07.345
OK.

38:10.146 --> 38:12.216
What?

38:12.702 --> 38:14.218
Bloody day you've had.

38:16.427 --> 38:18.035
Yeah.

38:19.829 --> 38:21.787
Come here.

38:34.629 --> 38:38.167
- Safe trip, yeah?
- Yeah. Good luck.

38:45.279 --> 38:47.685
Herr Brigadefuhrer,
I deeply regret my mistake

38:47.720 --> 38:49.821
and I fully accept any
disciplinary action

38:49.855 --> 38:52.023
you consider appropriate.

38:53.859 --> 38:56.424
Matthias...

38:57.363 --> 38:59.497
you showed insight,
courage and initiative.

38:59.531 --> 39:01.632
I respect that.

39:05.907 --> 39:07.803
I just want to know,

39:08.483 --> 39:10.341
why did you go to Schmidt
with your concerns,

39:10.376 --> 39:12.810
instead of directly to me?

39:12.845 --> 39:16.314
I thought I was doing the right thing.

39:16.348 --> 39:18.316
When I was a Hitler Youth,

39:18.350 --> 39:22.120
it was the first time
I was worth something.

39:22.154 --> 39:24.622
I belonged to something

39:24.656 --> 39:27.200
more important than me.

39:27.551 --> 39:29.027
And they taught us about loyalty,

39:29.061 --> 39:32.630
about what to do if we see

39:32.664 --> 39:35.533
- anything...
- I want to know what you think.

39:36.662 --> 39:39.337
I am a loyal person.

39:39.371 --> 39:41.939
I... I just didn't know

39:41.974 --> 39:44.342
which loyalty.

39:44.606 --> 39:46.750
To me or the flag.

39:48.625 --> 39:50.646
What would your father say?

39:50.914 --> 39:52.850
I never knew him.

39:52.885 --> 39:55.186
He gave his life in the First War.

39:57.778 --> 40:00.292
Your need to do your duty...

40:02.539 --> 40:03.895
to belong to a higher purpose.

40:03.929 --> 40:06.364
I honour it. I share it.

40:06.745 --> 40:08.497
But beyond that,

40:08.682 --> 40:11.202
we must all remember who
we are under the uniform,

40:11.236 --> 40:13.404
that one day this war will be over,

40:13.439 --> 40:16.874
and we will all have to
look one another in the eye.

40:19.218 --> 40:21.712
I can overlook this one transgression.

40:22.248 --> 40:23.915
But if I am to continue to teach you

40:23.949 --> 40:26.951
to reach your full potential,

40:27.360 --> 40:30.788
I want nothing less
than your full loyalty.

40:31.730 --> 40:34.425
Without question.

40:34.719 --> 40:36.471
Good.

40:37.329 --> 40:40.120
Then there is something
you need to think about.

40:43.727 --> 40:45.871
Sometimes,

40:46.902 --> 40:50.241
the only way to defeat your enemy

40:50.275 --> 40:52.910
is to become your enemy.

40:55.681 --> 40:57.782
Deploying truth and trust

40:57.816 --> 41:00.084
as they serve your strategy...

41:04.089 --> 41:07.267
that he's willing to
step into your parlour.

41:10.762 --> 41:14.523
And when he has relaxed just
enough to expose his throat...

41:17.102 --> 41:20.204
you strike.

41:29.681 --> 41:32.617
Berlin Station Hauptbahnhof.

41:32.651 --> 41:34.652
Berlin Station!

41:58.107 --> 42:00.411
Welcome to Germany, Dagna.

42:04.167 --> 42:06.717
Her name's Ania.

42:25.337 --> 42:27.238
What a relief

42:27.272 --> 42:29.240
to be back home.

42:49.194 --> 42:50.743
On the next X Company...

42:50.796 --> 42:51.455
Stop him.

42:51.508 --> 42:53.935
Operation Marigold is more
important than you or me.

42:53.976 --> 42:56.467
You got to get Aurora to the
finish line. Go!

42:57.470 --> 42:58.502
Sinclair,

42:58.504 --> 43:00.980
you know there is no where
for you to go.

43:01.180 --> 43:03.874
X Company,
next Wednesday at 9:00 on CBC.
