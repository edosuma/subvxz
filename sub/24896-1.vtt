00:58.559 --> 01:01.693
¶ This old guitar

01:01.695 --> 01:04.930
¶ Is falling apart

01:04.932 --> 01:08.333
¶ And I don't have the money

01:08.335 --> 01:10.936
¶ To mend it

01:11.872 --> 01:15.140
¶ And this whole life

01:15.142 --> 01:18.343
¶ Is passing me by

01:18.345 --> 01:21.613
¶ I got no ideas

01:21.615 --> 01:24.683
¶ How to change it

01:25.652 --> 01:28.720
¶ If this be the last words

01:28.722 --> 01:31.790
¶ That I ever write

01:31.792 --> 01:33.592
¶ Then please

01:33.594 --> 01:35.860
¶ Don't judge them too harshly

01:37.064 --> 01:38.730
Shut up!

01:38.732 --> 01:41.633
What the hell is wrong with you?

02:02.389 --> 02:05.824
¶ And if this be the last breath

02:05.826 --> 02:07.392
¶ That I ever take

02:08.561 --> 02:09.727
Will you please shut up?

02:10.631 --> 02:11.630
Please!

02:18.038 --> 02:21.139
Hey,
bud, how's the motel?

02:21.141 --> 02:22.841
Pretty shitty.

02:22.843 --> 02:26.177
Yeah, well,

02:26.179 --> 02:29.147
you know, if, if you don't
walk out on the next one,

02:29.149 --> 02:30.782
we'll put you up in
the Four Seasons.

02:30.784 --> 02:31.850
How's that?

02:33.687 --> 02:35.820
So you sent them the
measurements, right?

02:35.822 --> 02:37.789
For the costumes?

02:37.791 --> 02:39.724
Doug, I
don't think I can do this.

02:39.726 --> 02:41.059
Dude, can
you afford not to?

02:41.061 --> 02:42.093
Honestly?

02:42.095 --> 02:44.012
Honestly.

02:44.013 --> 02:45.930
Listen, uh, I'm just tryin'
to be honest with you here.

02:45.932 --> 02:48.166
You're lucky to be getting
this call at all, you know?

02:48.168 --> 02:49.834
I mean, you, look,

02:49.836 --> 02:50.935
you're a hell of
an artist and all,

02:50.937 --> 02:52.420
and you know that.

02:52.421 --> 02:53.904
The reality is, you're
not good with people.

02:53.907 --> 02:55.173
You're just not a people person.

02:55.175 --> 02:57.192
And, and that's
okay, that's fine.

02:57.193 --> 02:59.210
I'm just saying, with
your reputation and all,

02:59.212 --> 03:01.046
if you don't show
up for this one,

03:01.048 --> 03:04.883
this might be the
last call you get.

03:04.885 --> 03:08.053
I'll need a new guitar.

03:42.789 --> 03:43.988
Shut up,
what the hell, man?

03:43.990 --> 03:45.824
Turn it off!

03:47.894 --> 03:48.860
Are you kidding?

03:49.830 --> 03:51.162
Are you kidding?

03:51.965 --> 03:55.767
¶ Some humans ain't human

03:57.904 --> 04:01.272
¶ Some people ain't kind

04:03.510 --> 04:07.212
¶ You open up their hearts

04:09.216 --> 04:13.017
¶ Here's what you'll find

04:14.755 --> 04:18.189
¶ Some humans ain't human

04:20.327 --> 04:24.362
¶ Though they walk like we do

04:26.333 --> 04:30.301
¶ They live and they breathe

04:31.938 --> 04:35.774
¶ Just to turn your screw

04:38.044 --> 04:41.780
¶ You might go to church

04:43.183 --> 04:46.918
¶ And sit down in a pew

04:49.122 --> 04:53.191
¶ Those humans who ain't human

04:54.895 --> 04:59.130
¶ Could be sittin'
right next to you

05:00.967 --> 05:04.969
¶ They talk about your family

05:06.807 --> 05:10.909
¶ They talk about your clothes

05:35.101 --> 05:36.134
Hey.

05:37.103 --> 05:39.053
Joni.

05:42.042 --> 05:43.074
Elliott.

05:56.156 --> 05:57.639
Ladies and gentlemen,

05:57.640 --> 05:59.123
this is your captain speaking.

05:59.125 --> 06:02.126
We have been, uh,
ordered to land

06:02.128 --> 06:04.028
the aircraft, uh.

06:04.030 --> 06:05.630
If you're up, please
return to your seat.

06:05.632 --> 06:07.265
We need everyone seated

06:07.267 --> 06:10.268
with their seat belts fastened.

06:10.270 --> 06:12.237
We'll have more
information as we get it,

06:12.239 --> 06:13.188
but, for now, just
remain in your seats,

06:13.189 --> 06:14.138
seat belts fastened.

06:16.276 --> 06:19.177
We're returning to Los Angeles.

06:29.055 --> 06:30.955
As one plane
hit the World Trade Center,

06:30.957 --> 06:33.157
then, some time
later, another plane

06:33.159 --> 06:36.027
hit the other tower of
the World Trade Center

06:36.029 --> 06:39.163
in what looks to be a
coordinated attack on New York.

06:39.165 --> 06:40.665
We're going to go
back, to go live now,

06:40.667 --> 06:43.067
to the street where

06:43.069 --> 06:44.369
Ladies and gentlemen,

06:44.370 --> 06:45.670
your attention, please.

06:45.672 --> 06:47.672
At this time, for your safety,

06:47.674 --> 06:50.208
airport security
and the LAPD request

06:50.210 --> 06:51.943
that you exit the airport

06:51.945 --> 06:53.444
if not authorized personnel.

06:53.446 --> 06:55.280
This airport is being evacuated.

06:55.282 --> 06:57.482
All
circuits are busy now.

06:57.484 --> 07:00.184
Please try your call again.

07:00.186 --> 07:01.753
Please use the exits

07:01.754 --> 07:03.321
in a calm, orderly manner.
- Hey.

07:03.323 --> 07:04.455
Oh, hey.

07:04.457 --> 07:05.790
Did you get your bag?

07:05.791 --> 07:07.124
Exit
the airport immediately

07:07.125 --> 07:08.458
as instructed by the LAPD.

07:33.520 --> 07:35.053
Hey, Elliott!

08:14.260 --> 08:15.393
All right, where we goin'?

08:15.395 --> 08:16.961
Topanga Canyon.

08:16.962 --> 08:18.528
Um, I can show you once
we get up that way.

08:18.531 --> 08:20.131
Where do you need to go?

08:20.133 --> 08:21.132
Um.

08:23.069 --> 08:25.136
I don't know.

08:25.137 --> 08:27.204
Uh, I was just
passin' through town.

08:27.207 --> 08:28.439
Okay, well come up
to Scottie's place.

08:28.441 --> 08:30.308
It's my mom's friend.

08:30.309 --> 08:32.176
It's where I've been stayin'.

08:32.178 --> 08:33.410
Uh.

08:33.413 --> 08:35.013
Is that okay?

08:35.448 --> 08:36.414
Yeah.

08:36.416 --> 08:38.149
Um, yeah, sorry.

08:39.251 --> 08:40.251
It's a lot.

08:42.522 --> 08:44.188
Jesus Christ,

08:44.190 --> 08:46.491
the whole goddamned
world is blowin' up.

08:46.493 --> 08:49.193
Do you know how much
the fare is gonna be, sir?

08:49.195 --> 08:51.062
Do you have cash on you?

08:51.064 --> 08:52.096
Oh, uh.

08:53.033 --> 08:54.298
Um.

08:54.300 --> 08:56.267
You know what, don't
worry about it.

08:56.269 --> 08:57.435
What's that?

08:57.437 --> 09:00.471
Don't worry about the fare.

09:00.473 --> 09:02.407
Oh my gosh, thank you so much.

09:02.409 --> 09:05.810
We have enough to
worry about right now.

09:05.812 --> 09:08.046
At
least two hijacked planes

09:08.048 --> 09:10.314
were headed to Los Angeles.

09:16.222 --> 09:18.356
It's all right.

09:26.199 --> 09:28.232
Um, Elliott.

09:31.571 --> 09:36.174
The
police ask.

09:38.211 --> 09:40.411
This is not open for
general information.

09:40.413 --> 09:43.514
for family

09:43.516 --> 09:46.317
who have may have lost someone

09:46.319 --> 09:48.319
on one of the flights.

09:48.320 --> 09:50.320
So is there anybody
you need to call?

09:50.323 --> 09:51.656
Um, no, ma'am.

09:53.259 --> 09:54.592
Not your mom?

09:55.395 --> 09:57.595
Not your family? anybody?

10:00.500 --> 10:02.133
No, I'm good.

10:08.675 --> 10:13.111
You guys were supposed
to be there right now.

10:16.116 --> 10:17.515
I still need to be there.

10:31.598 --> 10:33.120
Honey?

10:33.121 --> 10:34.643
We're sorry.

10:34.644 --> 10:36.166
Due to heavy calling--
- I can't get through.

10:36.169 --> 10:37.535
Yeah, no.

10:37.537 --> 10:39.303
It's okay, honey,

10:39.305 --> 10:41.139
because your mom's
gonna be okay.

10:41.141 --> 10:42.307
She's okay.

10:42.308 --> 10:43.474
- Okay.
- the nurse is with her,

10:43.476 --> 10:44.675
right?

10:44.677 --> 10:45.676
Yeah.

10:50.383 --> 10:52.183
I shouldn't have left her.

10:52.185 --> 10:55.553
I knew I shouldn't have come.
- Come here.

11:01.427 --> 11:02.994
Did they say anything about

11:02.995 --> 11:04.562
flights starting up again?
- No.

11:04.564 --> 11:05.429
No.

11:06.566 --> 11:07.665
I can't just wait here.

11:07.667 --> 11:09.200
I have to figure out something,

11:09.202 --> 11:10.568
how to get back.

11:15.241 --> 11:16.274
Come on.

11:19.412 --> 11:21.379
Come on, we got this.

11:22.248 --> 11:23.748
Oh, your mama would love this.

11:27.320 --> 11:29.187
Hello, baby.

11:29.189 --> 11:31.956
She's been cross-country
nine or 10 times by now.

11:31.958 --> 11:33.658
This is your
old tour van, Scottie?

11:33.660 --> 11:36.060
Yes, it is,

11:36.061 --> 11:38.461
and she's a very
reliable girl sometimes.

11:38.464 --> 11:39.564
Watch your, watch
your head here.

11:39.566 --> 11:41.365
This is like a menace.

11:41.367 --> 11:42.700
Uh, here's your sound system,

11:42.702 --> 11:44.969
and there are some
great tunes in the back.

11:44.971 --> 11:46.621
This is a CB.

11:46.622 --> 11:48.272
It does not work, it never did.

11:48.274 --> 11:49.574
What's all
this stuff back here?

11:49.576 --> 11:51.742
Oh, that's mostly Jeff's gear.

11:51.744 --> 11:53.477
He said he was gonna
come get it last spring,

11:53.479 --> 11:55.279
but there it sits.

11:55.281 --> 11:56.514
Okay, come on, baby.

12:06.726 --> 12:08.159
Come on.

12:08.160 --> 12:09.593
Are you sure you're
not gonna need the van?

12:09.596 --> 12:11.179
Oh, Joni, do I look like

12:11.180 --> 12:12.763
I'm hittin' the
road anytime soon?

12:12.765 --> 12:13.714
Come on.

12:13.715 --> 12:14.664
Third time's the charm.

12:14.667 --> 12:16.234
You with me?

12:17.337 --> 12:18.669
Yes!

12:18.671 --> 12:20.538
We are in business.

12:23.643 --> 12:25.509
Pretty cool, huh?

12:25.511 --> 12:27.712
Yeah, we had everybody
we met on the road

12:27.714 --> 12:29.747
when we touring, and
we had 'em sign it.

12:29.749 --> 12:31.549
Ah, you're both musicians.

12:31.551 --> 12:33.284
Well Scottie is, not me.

12:33.286 --> 12:36.320
Oh hush, she has
the voice of an angel.

12:36.322 --> 12:37.789
Excuse me, baby.

12:37.790 --> 12:39.257
I've been givin'
it some thought,

12:39.259 --> 12:42.493
and I think if you both
take turns driving,

12:42.495 --> 12:44.795
you can make it in
three or four days.

12:44.797 --> 12:46.497
What's that?

12:46.499 --> 12:48.532
Well you need to
get back east, right?

12:48.534 --> 12:50.268
Well, I mean, yeah, but--

12:50.270 --> 12:51.335
So,

12:51.337 --> 12:52.837
here's your ride.

12:52.839 --> 12:54.739
Come on, I told you,
Jeff needs his gear

12:54.741 --> 12:57.041
that's in here, right?

12:57.042 --> 12:59.342
You'll be doin'
him a favor, baby.

12:59.345 --> 13:01.479
What do you think?

13:15.795 --> 13:20.398
You guys really wanna get
back on a plane right now?

13:26.472 --> 13:30.708
I really can't afford
to wait around here.

13:31.077 --> 13:31.642
Can you?

13:59.839 --> 14:01.339
I was
running from the dust

14:01.341 --> 14:03.607
and I grabbed onto something,

14:03.609 --> 14:05.509
and I didn't,

14:05.511 --> 14:08.112
I didn't realize at first that

14:08.114 --> 14:09.680
it was a hand,

14:09.682 --> 14:13.451
and we ran and we
ducked behind this car,

14:14.354 --> 14:17.588
and that's when I saw her face.

14:17.590 --> 14:18.789
I didn't,

14:18.791 --> 14:20.524
I didn't know her,

14:20.526 --> 14:22.760
but I found out it was Julie.

14:22.762 --> 14:24.929
She was a total stranger.

14:25.898 --> 14:28.566
And I wouldn't have
made it out without her.

14:40.146 --> 14:42.447
People
are, for the most part,

14:42.448 --> 14:44.749
largely calm, largely
respectful of each other.

14:44.751 --> 14:48.519
No doubt, many have

14:48.521 --> 14:50.154
It's weird, the farther
we get out from the city,

14:50.156 --> 14:52.656
the less real it all feels.

14:53.893 --> 14:56.927
It still feels
pretty real to me.

14:57.930 --> 14:59.864
Well, so, why did you say

14:59.866 --> 15:03.167
you were going out
to New York again?

15:03.169 --> 15:04.802
Uh, I got a gig.

15:05.805 --> 15:07.772
Like a band?

15:07.774 --> 15:08.806
Yeah.

15:09.575 --> 15:11.008
Hairpin Triggers.

15:11.978 --> 15:14.478
You're in the
Hairpin Triggers?

15:14.480 --> 15:15.913
That's amazing.

15:15.915 --> 15:17.581
It's just for their tour.

15:17.583 --> 15:19.917
Still, that's huge.

15:19.919 --> 15:21.652
I mean, I haven't
heard their music yet,

15:21.654 --> 15:24.555
but I hear their
name all the time.

15:24.557 --> 15:25.956
Yeah, well,

15:25.958 --> 15:26.991
I'm supposed to be there by now,

15:26.993 --> 15:28.526
so we'll see.

15:36.936 --> 15:40.504
So, you're, uh, goin'
to visit your mom?

15:40.506 --> 15:41.872
Uh,

15:41.874 --> 15:45.976
no, I live there with
my mom in New York.

15:45.978 --> 15:48.913
Oh yeah?

15:48.914 --> 15:51.849
Yeah, I just came out to LA
for a wedding for a friend.

15:57.590 --> 15:58.956
Shit.

16:05.231 --> 16:06.931
Oh my God.

16:13.606 --> 16:15.473
I got it God damn it.

16:15.875 --> 16:17.608
Dude I'm just trying to help.

16:18.744 --> 16:20.744
Do you know anything about cars?

16:20.746 --> 16:22.480
Of course I do.

16:23.483 --> 16:26.250
I just don't know
much about vans.

16:30.490 --> 16:32.490
It's definitely overheating.

16:32.492 --> 16:36.760
Yeah, Scottie said
that we should take it slow.

16:39.499 --> 16:40.965
We can slow down.

16:40.967 --> 16:44.502
We'll have to get
off the main roads.

16:45.505 --> 16:48.639
Be two-lane highways
from here on out.

16:52.578 --> 16:55.913
This is
gonna take forever.

16:55.915 --> 16:56.780
Yeah.

18:17.797 --> 18:19.981
Good evening.

18:19.982 --> 18:22.166
Today, our fellow
citizens came under attack

18:22.168 --> 18:24.001
in airplanes

18:24.003 --> 18:25.769
or in their offices.

18:25.771 --> 18:28.372
Secretaries,
businessmen and women,

18:28.374 --> 18:30.708
military and federal workers,

18:30.710 --> 18:32.142
moms and dads,

18:32.144 --> 18:34.178
friends and neighbors.

18:35.147 --> 18:38.182
And we responded with
the best of America,

18:38.184 --> 18:40.918
with the daring of
our rescue workers,

18:40.920 --> 18:43.120
with the caring for
strangers and neighbors

18:43.122 --> 18:44.888
who came to give blood

18:44.890 --> 18:47.891
and help in anyway they could.

18:47.893 --> 18:49.843
This is a day when all Americans

18:49.844 --> 18:51.794
from every walk of life
unite in our resolve

18:51.797 --> 18:53.831
for justice and peace.

18:54.767 --> 18:57.034
None of us will ever
forget this day.

18:57.036 --> 18:59.937
Yet we go forward
to defend freedom

18:59.939 --> 19:03.774
and all that is good
and just in our world.

19:06.078 --> 19:07.678
Good night,

19:07.680 --> 19:09.046
and God bless America.

19:42.848 --> 19:43.881
Hey.

19:44.450 --> 19:45.683
Mornin'.

19:47.253 --> 19:49.153
Where are we?

19:49.155 --> 19:51.755
Arizona, I think.

19:52.191 --> 19:53.857
Still?

19:53.859 --> 19:55.759
Yeah, I think so.

19:55.761 --> 19:58.062
You wanna find some coffee?

19:58.964 --> 19:59.830
Sure.

20:00.766 --> 20:02.966
Hey, why were we stopped?

20:08.140 --> 20:10.274
I don't know, I,

20:10.276 --> 20:12.943
I pulled over for a minute,

20:13.979 --> 20:17.715
but I think I fell
asleep for the night.

20:17.717 --> 20:18.882
Wait.

20:18.884 --> 20:20.984
So we haven't moved at all?

20:20.986 --> 20:22.486
You fell asleep first.

20:22.488 --> 20:25.122
Yeah, but you were drivin'!

20:28.828 --> 20:29.993
Look, I wanna
get back to, okay?

20:29.995 --> 20:31.161
I fell asleep, I'm sorry.

20:31.163 --> 20:33.063
I have people waiting on me!

20:33.065 --> 20:36.033
You have people
waiting on you?

20:42.208 --> 20:43.907
Look, my mom is
waiting on me, okay?

20:43.909 --> 20:47.277
I'm not going back
for some shitty band.

20:52.017 --> 20:54.351
Pull over, I wanna drive.

21:13.239 --> 21:14.938
I'm flyin' back.

21:16.041 --> 21:17.174
What?

21:17.176 --> 21:19.093
We'll find an airport,

21:19.094 --> 21:21.011
and wait til they
start flyin' again.

21:21.013 --> 21:22.780
Why, because I called
your band shitty?

21:22.782 --> 21:24.248
I'm not kiddin'.

21:26.285 --> 21:29.052
That's fine, just leave me.

21:32.158 --> 21:34.024
I don't even know you.

23:31.977 --> 23:33.443
¶ Bright eyes

23:33.445 --> 23:36.480
¶ And sweet smile

23:38.183 --> 23:41.184
¶ For with you

23:41.186 --> 23:44.087
¶ You are taking

23:44.089 --> 23:46.957
¶ The sunshine

23:47.993 --> 23:51.261
¶ That brightened

23:51.263 --> 23:54.498
¶ My path for a while

23:57.703 --> 24:01.338
¶ Come and sit by my side

24:02.207 --> 24:05.175
¶ If you love me

24:07.413 --> 24:10.414
¶ Do not hasten

24:10.416 --> 24:13.450
¶ To bid me adieu

24:16.989 --> 24:19.990
¶ Just remember

24:19.992 --> 24:23.360
¶ That Red River Valley

24:26.732 --> 24:30.167
¶ And the cowboy

24:30.169 --> 24:33.570
¶ That loved you so true

24:41.513 --> 24:43.747
¶ When you think

24:43.749 --> 24:46.483
¶ Of this valley

24:46.485 --> 24:49.453
¶ You're leavin'

24:50.489 --> 24:54.057
¶ Oh, how lonesome

24:54.059 --> 24:57.260
¶ And sad it will be

25:00.132 --> 25:03.200
¶ Please remember

25:03.202 --> 25:05.068
¶ This heart

25:05.070 --> 25:08.171
¶ You are breaking

25:09.775 --> 25:13.276
¶ And be true to

25:13.278 --> 25:16.446
¶ Your promise to me

25:19.485 --> 25:22.085
¶ Come and sit

25:22.087 --> 25:24.187
¶ By my side

25:24.189 --> 25:27.157
¶ If you love me

25:28.560 --> 25:32.095
¶ Do not hasten

25:32.097 --> 25:35.132
¶ To bid me adieu

25:38.170 --> 25:41.171
¶ Just remember

25:41.173 --> 25:44.541
¶ That Red River Valley

25:47.579 --> 25:51.314
¶ And the cowboy

25:51.316 --> 25:54.217
¶ Who loved you

25:54.219 --> 25:56.453
¶ So true

26:13.539 --> 26:14.571
Hungry?

26:17.342 --> 26:19.142
Yeah, starvin'.

26:21.146 --> 26:22.179
Okay.

26:24.850 --> 26:27.084
¶ Black Jack David
come a-ridin' by

26:27.086 --> 26:28.652
¶ And he sang so sweet and gay

26:28.654 --> 26:31.254
¶ He

26:31.256 --> 26:33.090
¶ Made the green
hills around him sing

26:33.092 --> 26:35.158
¶ And he charmed
the heart of a lady

26:35.160 --> 26:38.628
¶ To charm the heart of a lady

26:38.630 --> 26:40.497
¶ How old are you my
pretty little miss

26:40.499 --> 26:45.102
¶ How old are you my honey

26:45.671 --> 26:47.087
¶ If I don't die from
the mourn of love

26:47.088 --> 26:48.504
¶ I'll be 16 next Sunday

26:48.507 --> 26:52.342
¶ I'll be 16 next Sunday

26:52.344 --> 26:54.177
¶ Well I forsake
my house and land

26:54.179 --> 26:58.215
¶ And I forsake my baby

26:58.217 --> 26:59.883
¶ I forsake my new wed lord

26:59.885 --> 27:01.885
¶ To stay with my
Black Jack David

27:01.887 --> 27:05.589
¶ To stay with my
Black Jack David

27:05.591 --> 27:07.390
¶ Well she rolled off
her high-heeled shoes

27:07.392 --> 27:11.528
¶ They were made
of Spanish leather

27:11.530 --> 27:13.363
¶ She pulled on her
low-heeled shoes

27:13.365 --> 27:15.499
¶ They both rode off together

27:15.501 --> 27:19.536
¶ They both rode off together

27:20.539 --> 27:22.139
¶ Last night I slept
on a warm feather bed

27:22.141 --> 27:26.209
¶ Between my husband and baby

27:26.211 --> 27:28.178
¶ Tonight I lay on
the cold, cold ground

27:28.180 --> 27:30.280
¶ Beside that Black Jack David

27:30.282 --> 27:33.650
¶ Beside that Black Jack David

27:33.652 --> 27:35.685
¶ Yep

27:43.562 --> 27:45.362
Townes Van Zandt.

27:46.165 --> 27:47.665
Oh yeah!

27:47.666 --> 27:49.166
Willie Nelson,
Red-Headed Stranger.

27:49.168 --> 27:50.367
Leadbelly.

27:50.369 --> 27:52.302
She's got some gold in here.

27:52.304 --> 27:54.171
She does indeed.

27:54.173 --> 27:57.307
Yeah, Scottie's the
best with that stuff.

27:57.309 --> 27:59.960
She just looks
all over the place

27:59.961 --> 28:02.612
for, like, the best old
folk songs she can find.

28:03.582 --> 28:04.626
Live recordings and
all these, like,

28:04.627 --> 28:05.671
unreleased things.

28:05.672 --> 28:06.716
She finds everything.

28:06.718 --> 28:09.452
Been doin' it for years.

28:09.454 --> 28:10.387
That's pretty great.

28:10.389 --> 28:11.421
Yeah.

28:14.359 --> 28:17.394
Do the Hairpin
Triggers play folk?

28:18.430 --> 28:20.197
Not even close.

28:23.368 --> 28:25.969
Sorry I called
them shitty earlier.

28:25.971 --> 28:27.204
I honestly haven't even heard

28:27.206 --> 28:28.705
any of their songs.

28:29.608 --> 28:31.741
It's all right.

28:31.743 --> 28:34.511
Actually are kind of shitty.

28:37.282 --> 28:39.482
I just knew their
costumes were shitty.

28:45.290 --> 28:46.656
Enough of that.

29:08.480 --> 29:11.514
I would've sworn there'd
be a bathroom out here.

29:11.516 --> 29:14.251
You sure pee a lot.

29:15.654 --> 29:17.654
I drink a lot of water.

29:17.656 --> 29:19.022
Eh, just sayin'.

29:19.024 --> 29:20.257
¶ If you don't know Spanish

29:20.259 --> 29:23.460
¶ You can still sing it

29:23.462 --> 29:25.695
¶ Elysian Park is beautiful

29:25.697 --> 29:28.665
¶ Elysian Park is
my kind of park

29:28.667 --> 29:31.301
¶ The air is free, my friends

29:31.303 --> 29:33.770
¶ We don't want
buildings in the park

29:33.772 --> 29:36.039
¶ We want the green grass

29:36.041 --> 29:38.541
¶ The park is yours and mine

30:41.106 --> 30:43.229
Hello.

30:43.230 --> 30:45.353
- Hi.
- Hi.

30:47.846 --> 30:48.645
Anything new

30:48.647 --> 30:49.512
on there?

30:49.514 --> 30:52.082
No.

31:04.696 --> 31:06.396
You sit there.

31:15.874 --> 31:17.907
Nice fort you got here.

31:17.909 --> 31:20.577
It's not a fort,
it's a teepee.

31:20.579 --> 31:21.945
Oh.

31:21.947 --> 31:22.979
Sorry.

31:23.782 --> 31:26.199
Uh,

31:26.200 --> 31:28.617
hey, you, uh, think I
can get my hat back?

31:28.620 --> 31:30.720
Where's your wife?

31:30.722 --> 31:32.222
Uh, that,

31:32.223 --> 31:33.723
that's not my wife.

31:33.725 --> 31:34.758
Why not?

31:37.529 --> 31:38.795
I don't know.

31:41.767 --> 31:43.617
We're sorry,

31:43.618 --> 31:45.468
due to heavy volume

31:45.470 --> 31:46.581
Miss.

31:46.582 --> 31:47.693
- Hi.
- Excuse me, Miss.

31:47.694 --> 31:48.805
You, you gave me
an extra dollar.

31:48.807 --> 31:50.607
Oh, thank you.

31:50.609 --> 31:51.674
Yeah, um,

31:51.676 --> 31:53.676
is, uh, everything okay?

31:53.678 --> 31:54.711
Yeah.

31:55.614 --> 31:56.679
Ah, minute.

31:57.482 --> 31:58.648
Here, for you.

31:58.650 --> 31:59.816
- Oh, I can't--
- No!

31:59.818 --> 32:01.701
Please, take it, take it,

32:01.702 --> 32:03.585
from one American to
another, huh, okay?

32:03.588 --> 32:04.421
Thank you.

32:04.422 --> 32:05.255
Yeah, you are very welcome.

32:05.256 --> 32:06.089
Safe travels, huh?

32:06.090 --> 32:06.923
- Thank you.
- Okay.

32:06.925 --> 32:07.957
Bye.

32:07.959 --> 32:10.560
What are you workin' on there?

32:10.562 --> 32:12.962
It's one of my fire trucks.

32:14.866 --> 32:16.433
Oh yeah?

32:16.435 --> 32:17.534
Who's it for?

32:17.536 --> 32:19.536
For all the people.

32:20.605 --> 32:22.505
What people?

32:22.507 --> 32:26.543
For all those people
who were in the fire.

32:43.028 --> 32:46.863
You look
good without your hat.

32:46.865 --> 32:47.864
Thanks.

32:51.636 --> 32:55.872
I've had it on pretty much
every day since I got it.

33:01.480 --> 33:02.712
Hear anything?

33:03.748 --> 33:05.014
From my mom?

33:08.487 --> 33:10.553
No, I haven't been able
to get through yet.

33:23.935 --> 33:26.636
It's really tough, you know?

33:27.839 --> 33:30.773
She's always been the really
strong one in the family,

33:30.775 --> 33:31.774
and

33:32.911 --> 33:35.011
I guess, right now, I'm

33:37.682 --> 33:40.984
just trying to take care of her.

33:40.986 --> 33:42.752
But I don't even.

33:47.893 --> 33:51.027
I feel selfish to
complain about it.

34:56.795 --> 35:01.030
I can't believe
I gave that kid my hat.

35:07.772 --> 35:10.873
¶ Swing low

35:10.875 --> 35:13.776
¶ Sweet chariot

35:15.113 --> 35:17.880
¶ Comin' for to carry

35:17.882 --> 35:19.682
¶ Me home
- Can you hear me?

35:19.684 --> 35:21.884
No, I'm fine, I'm fine.

35:21.886 --> 35:23.620
No, I'm drivin'.

35:24.389 --> 35:26.155
I'm in this shitty
van with this girl.

35:26.157 --> 35:27.957
It's a long story.

35:29.027 --> 35:31.761
¶ Comin' for to carry

35:31.763 --> 35:33.997
¶ Me home

35:35.667 --> 35:38.701
¶ If you get there

35:38.703 --> 35:41.170
¶ Before I do

35:42.907 --> 35:46.075
Grow up, Doug, I'm
not gonna answer that.

35:46.077 --> 35:47.143
Yeah.

35:47.145 --> 35:48.177
Doug.

35:50.115 --> 35:51.648
Yes, she's cute.

35:51.650 --> 35:53.850
Just call the number, okay?

35:53.851 --> 35:56.051
I'll get hold of you
in a couple days.

35:56.054 --> 35:58.755
¶ Comin' for to carry

35:58.757 --> 36:00.990
¶ Me home

36:07.666 --> 36:09.065
Really has a way of
takin' your mind off things,

36:09.067 --> 36:10.133
don't it?

36:10.135 --> 36:12.068
Yeah, it sure does.

36:12.904 --> 36:14.737
Hey, Elliott, this is Fargo.

36:14.739 --> 36:16.072
- Pleasure.
- Hey, Elliott.

36:16.074 --> 36:17.540
Uh, don't happen to know

36:17.541 --> 36:19.007
when the shop opens up, do ya?

36:19.010 --> 36:20.943
Uh, those folks are long gone.

36:20.945 --> 36:22.078
Oh really?

36:22.080 --> 36:23.713
Yeah.

36:23.715 --> 36:25.582
How bad is it?

36:25.583 --> 36:27.450
Uh, it's been
overheatin' pretty often.

36:27.452 --> 36:28.835
Well, it's a hike,

36:28.836 --> 36:30.219
but you could take it
out to Whitey's place.

36:30.221 --> 36:32.021
Whitey?

36:32.022 --> 36:33.822
This crazy cat who
lives out in the dunes.

36:33.825 --> 36:35.959
He can fix damn near anything,

36:35.960 --> 36:38.094
but he can't pull
himself out of the dunes.

36:38.096 --> 36:39.929
Can't fix stupid, I guess.

36:40.965 --> 36:42.198
I guess not.

36:43.768 --> 36:44.801
Well.

36:50.141 --> 36:53.142
Oh my gosh,
that was amazing.

36:53.144 --> 36:54.077
Where's the seat belt?

36:54.079 --> 36:55.878
What's that?

36:55.880 --> 36:57.914
Singing with him like that.

36:57.916 --> 36:59.749
You must get that all the time.

36:59.751 --> 37:01.984
It's kinda not
like that anymore.

37:01.986 --> 37:03.019
Why not?

37:04.222 --> 37:05.889
I don't know.

37:05.890 --> 37:07.557
I guess that's the
way it started out.

37:07.558 --> 37:09.225
At least, all the stories
I heard about folk music.

37:09.227 --> 37:10.827
But,

37:10.829 --> 37:12.228
ever since I been travelin',

37:12.230 --> 37:15.298
I just kinda haven't
experienced it.

37:15.300 --> 37:18.901
People just seem too cool
or somethin', I guess.

37:18.903 --> 37:20.269
Well we should bring it back.

37:20.271 --> 37:21.771
Bring what back?

37:21.773 --> 37:23.806
Bring back the folk.

37:24.743 --> 37:26.142
Yeah, maybe so.

37:27.178 --> 37:29.078
There we go.

37:29.080 --> 37:30.046
What

37:30.048 --> 37:31.981
are you doing?

37:31.983 --> 37:34.817
Well, my pop used to
have this old Suburban,

37:34.819 --> 37:36.119
and every time it'd overheat.

37:36.121 --> 37:37.153
Oh my gosh.

37:37.155 --> 37:38.821
We would, uh,

37:39.891 --> 37:41.941
kick the heat on,

37:41.942 --> 37:43.992
and let some of the
heat off the motor.

37:43.995 --> 37:45.562
It's not gonna fix it,

37:45.563 --> 37:47.130
but it might get us to Whitey's.

37:47.132 --> 37:49.799
The adventure continues.

37:49.801 --> 37:50.833
Yep.

37:51.770 --> 37:52.835
¶ Freight train

37:52.837 --> 37:54.170
¶ Freight train

37:54.172 --> 37:57.039
¶ Runs so fast

37:57.041 --> 37:58.274
¶ Freight train

37:58.276 --> 38:00.009
¶ Freight train

38:00.011 --> 38:03.112
¶ Runs so fast

38:03.114 --> 38:04.947
¶ Please don't tell

38:04.949 --> 38:07.350
¶ What train I'm on

38:07.352 --> 38:08.918
¶ They won't know

38:08.920 --> 38:12.188
¶ What route I'm gone

38:20.932 --> 38:23.332
Bring back the folk!

38:25.336 --> 38:27.203
¶ When I'm dead

38:27.205 --> 38:30.239
¶ And in my grave

38:31.075 --> 38:33.976
¶ No more good times

38:33.978 --> 38:37.213
¶ Here I crave

38:37.215 --> 38:38.948
¶ Place the stones

38:38.950 --> 38:42.218
¶ At my head and feet

38:47.225 --> 38:49.292
Stick close.

38:50.094 --> 38:51.744
Can't park there.

38:51.745 --> 38:53.395
Ya gotta take it on back
to the Ranger station.

38:53.398 --> 38:55.231
Uh, Whitey?

38:55.233 --> 38:56.999
Come again?

38:57.001 --> 38:59.969
Um, we're lookin' for Whitey.

38:59.971 --> 39:01.971
The name's Dale.

39:01.972 --> 39:03.972
Oh, Dale, sorry, we're
lookin' for Whitey's trailer.

39:03.975 --> 39:06.108
We must have the wrong one.

39:06.110 --> 39:06.976
Whitey!

39:07.912 --> 39:10.213
Hey, Whitey, you out there?

39:11.349 --> 39:14.050
Pagin' Whitey, party of one!

39:19.858 --> 39:21.123
Wipe your shoes off.

39:21.125 --> 39:21.991
Come on in.

39:24.262 --> 39:25.617
Like I said, the name's Dale,

39:25.618 --> 39:26.973
but them sons of bitches in town

39:26.974 --> 39:28.329
like to call me Whitey
for some reason.

39:28.333 --> 39:30.066
It's really
beautiful out here, Dale.

39:30.068 --> 39:31.901
Yeah, well I don't
get a lot of visitors.

39:31.903 --> 39:33.269
It is a bit bedraggled.

39:34.405 --> 39:35.872
Got a flashlight.

39:35.874 --> 39:37.039
Solar, too.

39:37.041 --> 39:38.094
I mean, if you need it.

39:38.095 --> 39:39.148
Thank you.
I, I, I don't know

39:39.149 --> 39:40.202
that you need it, but, uh,

39:40.203 --> 39:41.256
well, you probably don't,

39:41.257 --> 39:42.310
what with a lantern
and all, huh?

39:42.313 --> 39:44.113
- Thank you.
- Well, I got some whiskey

39:44.115 --> 39:45.732
around here somewhere.
- Sir?

39:45.733 --> 39:47.350
Where'd I put
that goddamn bottle?

39:47.352 --> 39:49.652
I don't, uh, drink much myself,

39:49.654 --> 39:51.954
except on, uh,
special occasions,

39:51.956 --> 39:53.656
which I guess
that's what this is.

39:53.657 --> 39:55.357
Dale, we're havin' some
trouble with our van.

39:55.360 --> 39:57.059
Yeah, we ran
into Fargo in town.

39:57.061 --> 39:58.177
He said that maybe you'd be able

39:58.178 --> 39:59.294
to take a look at it for us.

39:59.297 --> 40:00.597
Fargo?

40:00.598 --> 40:01.898
You mean that damn
bastard's still around, huh?

40:01.900 --> 40:03.199
Yeah.

40:03.201 --> 40:04.612
Um,

40:04.613 --> 40:06.024
do you think you could
take a look at it?

40:06.025 --> 40:07.436
What do you think I'm
doin' over here, lady?

40:07.438 --> 40:10.172
Just tryin' to find
my goddamn headlamp.

40:10.174 --> 40:13.409
Now come on, let's
go, time's wastin'.

40:15.179 --> 40:18.381
Let's go see what's
goin' on up here.

40:19.250 --> 40:20.917
Oh, it's a 350.

40:20.919 --> 40:22.451
I seen them before.

40:25.323 --> 40:26.355
Can
I give ya a hand?

40:26.357 --> 40:28.457
I got it, goddamn it.

40:31.930 --> 40:33.513
Go ahead and give
it a turn there,

40:33.514 --> 40:35.097
huh, cowboy?
- All right.

40:42.040 --> 40:43.272
Well, shoot.

40:44.075 --> 40:45.341
It's been overheatin', ain't it?

40:45.343 --> 40:46.743
Yeah.

40:46.744 --> 40:48.144
We've been drivin'
with the heater on.

40:48.146 --> 40:49.445
Well that's smart.

40:49.447 --> 40:50.479
Yeah.

40:50.481 --> 40:53.215
It's makin' this
weird noise, too.

40:53.217 --> 40:54.216
What noise?

40:54.218 --> 40:56.052
Make the noise for me.

40:56.054 --> 40:57.086
Um.

40:57.088 --> 40:58.187
Make it like?

40:58.189 --> 41:00.356
Make the goddamn noise!

41:01.492 --> 41:06.095
Uh, it's, it was
like.

41:07.198 --> 41:08.965
Huh.

41:08.967 --> 41:11.601
I don't know that noise.

41:11.602 --> 41:14.236
Uh, okay, you can shut it
down now there, partner.

41:14.238 --> 41:16.205
All right.

41:19.477 --> 41:21.243
What do you think?

41:21.245 --> 41:23.112
Well, I got me some ideas, uh,

41:23.114 --> 41:24.280
but I, I can't do much with it

41:24.282 --> 41:25.381
in this light.

41:25.383 --> 41:27.383
Can you leave it here with me?

41:27.385 --> 41:28.250
I don't know.

41:28.252 --> 41:29.619
Um.

41:29.620 --> 41:30.987
Do you think we can
definitely not drive it

41:30.989 --> 41:32.264
how it is?

41:32.265 --> 41:33.540
Oh, I wouldn't.

41:33.541 --> 41:34.816
You'd be riskin' bigger
problems down the road.

41:34.817 --> 41:36.092
You don't wanna
melt them innards.

41:36.094 --> 41:37.526
That's where all
the good stuff is.

41:37.528 --> 41:39.150
Right.

41:39.151 --> 41:40.773
Anyways, I gotta go
pump me some water.

41:40.774 --> 41:42.396
We gotta try and cool
this steamer off.

41:42.400 --> 41:43.299
You need a hand?

41:47.171 --> 41:48.304
Hey, Dale.

41:49.073 --> 41:50.923
Um,

41:50.924 --> 41:52.774
well we really don't
have a lot of money.

41:52.777 --> 41:54.176
Well, I tell ya what, Missy,

41:54.178 --> 41:56.178
you two go have a seat inside,

41:56.180 --> 41:57.663
and, when I get back,

41:57.664 --> 41:59.147
we'll have ourselves
a little barter.

41:59.150 --> 42:01.150
How's that grab ya?

42:01.151 --> 42:03.151
- That sounds great.
- All right.

42:07.458 --> 42:10.426
Do you see a TV in here?

42:10.428 --> 42:11.594
Uh uh, why?

42:12.530 --> 42:14.130
I was just,

42:14.132 --> 42:15.798
I was just wondering
if he knows about

42:15.800 --> 42:17.566
all that's going on.

42:20.104 --> 42:21.437
I don't.

42:21.439 --> 42:23.372
Okay, I watered it.

42:23.374 --> 42:25.041
We'll just let it set in there.

42:25.043 --> 42:27.043
I'll take a look at
it at first light.

42:27.045 --> 42:29.145
As the rooster crows.

42:29.147 --> 42:31.414
I, uh, I don't have a rooster.

42:31.416 --> 42:33.549
It's way too hard
for 'em out here.

42:33.551 --> 42:35.284
Hey, Dale, has
anybody been by here

42:35.286 --> 42:36.819
in the last day or so?

42:36.821 --> 42:38.587
Buddy, I ain't had
anybody stop by here

42:38.589 --> 42:40.322
in the last year or so.

42:40.324 --> 42:42.124
'Cept them Rangers and, uh,

42:42.126 --> 42:45.161
well I know all those bums.

42:45.163 --> 42:47.063
Uh, have you
been to town much?

42:47.065 --> 42:48.197
Well I try not to.

42:48.199 --> 42:50.132
I used to go into Rick's

42:50.134 --> 42:52.351
to play a little dominoes,

42:52.352 --> 42:54.569
but I haven't been
there in ages.

42:54.572 --> 42:55.471
Okay.

42:55.473 --> 42:56.605
I got it.

42:56.607 --> 42:58.841
Listen, I got an idea.

42:58.843 --> 42:59.642
All right?

42:59.644 --> 43:01.127
Uh,

43:01.128 --> 43:02.611
I'm not much of a chef, but, uh,

43:02.613 --> 43:05.581
well I, I sure can help you
with that ride of yours.

43:05.583 --> 43:07.850
How's about, in return,

43:07.852 --> 43:09.251
y'all fix me a meal?

43:09.253 --> 43:10.619
Yeah, sure.

43:10.621 --> 43:11.587
We can handle that.

43:11.589 --> 43:13.890
Great!

43:13.891 --> 43:16.192
'cause I get so tired of
the same damn recipes.

43:16.194 --> 43:18.360
I mean, I suppose I could, uh,

43:18.362 --> 43:20.463
learn some new ones, but, uh,

43:20.465 --> 43:21.630
well, you know.

43:21.632 --> 43:22.665
Old dogs.

43:24.268 --> 43:26.602
So, uh, where ya headed anyways?

43:26.604 --> 43:28.170
Uh, New York.

43:28.172 --> 43:29.522
Is that right?

43:29.523 --> 43:30.873
All the way to New York, huh?

43:30.875 --> 43:33.409
What's the special occasion?

43:36.380 --> 43:37.880
Well, Dale, um--

43:37.882 --> 43:39.198
We're musicians.

43:39.199 --> 43:40.515
- Musicians, you say?
- Yeah, mm hmm.

43:40.518 --> 43:42.118
We're headed there for a gig.

43:42.120 --> 43:43.352
A gig.

43:43.354 --> 43:44.820
Well that's terrific.

43:44.821 --> 43:46.287
Well, I can sure get you
there in a couple of days,

43:46.290 --> 43:47.523
no problemo.

43:47.525 --> 43:49.358
Wow.

43:49.359 --> 43:51.192
So I have myself, uh, two chefs

43:51.195 --> 43:53.362
who can also play a
little dinner music.

43:53.364 --> 43:56.499
I must've hit the
hillbilly jackpot!

43:57.268 --> 43:58.601
Um, yeah, you know, uh,

43:58.603 --> 44:01.137
actually, Joni can
play you one right now.

44:01.139 --> 44:02.438
Oh, I don't know, do you?

44:02.440 --> 44:03.672
Yeah, grab a guitar.

44:03.674 --> 44:05.975
I can handle this.

44:05.976 --> 44:08.277
Play this fine man one
of your songs, would ya?

44:08.279 --> 44:09.245
One of mine?

44:09.247 --> 44:10.179
Yeah.

44:10.181 --> 44:11.747
Bring back the folk.

44:14.285 --> 44:15.584
Wait.

44:15.586 --> 44:17.870
Be careful.

44:17.871 --> 44:20.155
There's a rabid raccoon
in the neighborhood.

45:33.331 --> 45:35.231
¶ I've been livin' in New York

47:48.833 --> 47:49.865
Yeah.

47:49.867 --> 47:55.604
I had to get away from all
them protests and whatnot.

47:55.873 --> 47:56.638
You see, uh,

47:58.476 --> 48:01.677
comin' home wasn't
like after WW Deuce.

48:01.679 --> 48:03.145
All the

48:03.147 --> 48:04.813
fanfare and ticker tape

48:04.815 --> 48:05.881
and,

48:05.883 --> 48:06.915
and such.

48:08.419 --> 48:09.718
Right.

48:09.720 --> 48:11.787
That's for damn sure.

48:16.560 --> 48:17.710
But not to,

48:17.711 --> 48:18.861
not to get all sappy and such,

48:18.863 --> 48:19.962
but, uh,

48:19.964 --> 48:21.964
well, it is nice to have

48:21.966 --> 48:24.800
some drinkin' buddies
here for a change.

48:24.802 --> 48:27.803
And, uh, musicians to boot.

48:27.805 --> 48:30.506
It's nice for us, too, Dale.

48:30.508 --> 48:32.808
Power of music, my friends.

48:32.810 --> 48:34.443
Power of music.

48:36.647 --> 48:39.164
I remember a story

48:39.165 --> 48:41.682
about, uh, Pete Seeger
from way back when.

48:41.685 --> 48:44.186
It was right after his,

48:44.188 --> 48:47.823
you know, big trip to
North Vietnam and all that.

48:47.825 --> 48:48.857
Uh.

48:50.428 --> 48:51.894
He used to put on these shows.

48:51.896 --> 48:54.696
He'd have the whole
audience sing along.

48:54.698 --> 48:56.432
You know about that old shtick.

48:56.434 --> 48:57.800
- Yeah.
- Oh yeah.

48:57.802 --> 48:59.501
'Course you do.

48:59.503 --> 49:01.503
Well he was finishin'
up one of them shows,

49:01.505 --> 49:03.572
and, uh, this young kid comes up

49:03.574 --> 49:05.841
out of the crowd,
onto the stage,

49:05.843 --> 49:07.843
and when he look at, uh,

49:07.845 --> 49:09.711
Seeger all serious like,

49:09.713 --> 49:11.847
and, and he says to him,

49:11.849 --> 49:13.482
uh, Mr. Seeger,

49:14.552 --> 49:15.584
sir,

49:16.854 --> 49:19.988
I came here tonight to kill you.

49:19.990 --> 49:21.924
Son of a beast.

49:21.926 --> 49:22.958
Damn fool.

49:22.960 --> 49:25.561
No, no, no, I, I got it.

49:25.563 --> 49:27.863
I'm the host, you stay put.

49:28.866 --> 49:31.500
So, Seeger looks at him.

49:31.502 --> 49:33.235
And, and he says, uh,

49:33.237 --> 49:35.704
says, came here to kill me?

49:36.640 --> 49:37.873
And, and the kid looks him right

49:37.875 --> 49:39.875
dead in the eye and says,

49:39.877 --> 49:41.577
but don't worry, Petey,

49:41.579 --> 49:42.978
I ain't gonna kill ya,

49:42.980 --> 49:45.681
I ain't gonna kill ya.

49:45.683 --> 49:47.015
And instead he, uh,

49:47.017 --> 49:50.752
he shakes his hand
and, and thanks him,

49:50.754 --> 49:52.554
and then walks
off into the night

49:52.556 --> 49:54.523
without another word.

49:55.493 --> 49:57.993
I mean, that kid sat
there all night long,

49:57.995 --> 49:59.895
listenin' to them songs,

49:59.897 --> 50:02.664
and watchin' them
folks sing along,

50:02.666 --> 50:04.766
and what does he decide to do?

50:04.768 --> 50:08.003
Why, he decides, instead
of killin' Seeger,

50:08.005 --> 50:12.074
that he's gonna shake
his goddamn hand instead.

50:15.679 --> 50:16.979
Power of music.

50:19.550 --> 50:21.049
The power of music.

50:24.955 --> 50:27.506
Well.

50:27.507 --> 50:30.058
It would appear that I
am sufficiently drunk.

50:32.296 --> 50:34.062
Take my truck.

50:34.064 --> 50:37.533
You can get yourself
a room in town.

50:38.702 --> 50:39.801
Dirt cheap.

50:55.319 --> 50:57.586
Maybe we should get
another drink first?

51:00.791 --> 51:02.274
Okay.

51:02.275 --> 51:03.758
There's discussion

51:03.759 --> 51:05.242
already in Washington
of perhaps giving

51:05.243 --> 51:06.726
our government, or the
intelligence agencies,

51:06.730 --> 51:08.964
more power than
they've previously had,

51:08.966 --> 51:11.767
perhaps even broadening
the scope of policing.

51:13.671 --> 51:14.570
To Dale.

51:14.572 --> 51:15.571
To Dale.

51:19.743 --> 51:20.876
You can't cheers and not drink.

51:20.878 --> 51:22.110
It's bad luck.

51:28.886 --> 51:30.953
I saw a payphone back there.

51:30.955 --> 51:31.987
Oh yeah?

51:31.989 --> 51:34.573
Thank you.

51:34.574 --> 51:37.158
Well, it's probably too
late to call right now.

51:37.962 --> 51:39.161
Her nurse is taking care of her

51:39.163 --> 51:41.513
for the weekend for me,

51:41.514 --> 51:43.864
and I'm just hopin'
that she's gonna stay.

51:43.867 --> 51:46.068
So nobody else to help?

51:50.708 --> 51:53.042
I mean, I have a sister,

51:53.043 --> 51:55.377
but she's just not
around very much.

51:55.379 --> 51:58.880
What's she doin'
that's so important?

52:03.020 --> 52:04.937
I don't know.

52:04.938 --> 52:06.855
We don't talk very much anymore.

52:08.759 --> 52:12.995
It seems like a lot of
responsibility for one person.

52:15.733 --> 52:17.065
Yeah.

52:24.742 --> 52:25.774
Yay!

52:30.881 --> 52:33.815
Everyone copes with it
differently, you know?

52:33.817 --> 52:36.818
My sister's off livin'
her life in the world,

52:36.820 --> 52:38.720
and I'm takin' care of my mom,

52:38.722 --> 52:41.190
and, when I get a chance,

52:41.191 --> 52:43.659
I go into the back bedroom
and play a little guitar.

52:43.661 --> 52:44.960
That doesn't surprise me.

52:44.962 --> 52:46.061
Why is that?

52:46.063 --> 52:47.996
'Cause you're very good.

52:47.998 --> 52:48.964
I don't know
about all of that,

52:48.966 --> 52:50.932
but thank you.

52:50.934 --> 52:52.934
I'm serious.

52:52.935 --> 52:54.935
You're too good to be
playin' in the back.

52:54.938 --> 52:56.171
You should be talkin'.

52:56.173 --> 52:57.428
Me?

52:57.429 --> 52:58.684
You said yourself
that you thought

52:58.685 --> 52:59.940
the band is shitty.

52:59.943 --> 53:02.077
Yeah, but I need a job.

53:08.085 --> 53:09.885
Feels like with all
this stuff goin' on

53:09.887 --> 53:12.454
that everyone's maybe
examining their lives

53:12.456 --> 53:15.090
a little bit right now.

53:15.092 --> 53:16.958
All I'm examining is
the bottom of this glass

53:16.960 --> 53:17.993
right now.

53:19.163 --> 53:21.096
Next round's on me.

53:23.067 --> 53:24.099
Yes, it is.

53:24.101 --> 53:25.100
A little funny.

53:25.102 --> 53:26.468
No, it's not.

53:26.470 --> 53:28.036
Kind of funny.

53:28.038 --> 53:30.105
I think we're that way.

53:31.008 --> 53:32.274
Hey, hey.

53:32.276 --> 53:33.775
Fargo!

53:33.777 --> 53:34.843
You two need a lift?

53:34.845 --> 53:36.128
Yeah!

53:36.129 --> 53:37.412
Ah, we're just up the way.

53:37.413 --> 53:38.696
We can walk, it's no big deal.

53:38.697 --> 53:39.980
No, we would love a ride.

53:39.983 --> 53:41.361
All right.

53:41.362 --> 53:42.740
What's that song?

53:42.741 --> 53:44.119
Oh my gosh, turn
it up, I love this.

53:44.121 --> 53:45.921
¶ Fun on the bayou

53:45.923 --> 53:47.122
I love it!

53:47.124 --> 53:49.491
¶ Jambalaya and a crawfish pie

53:49.493 --> 53:51.059
¶ And a file gumbo

53:51.061 --> 53:52.227
Ride might be best, bro.

53:52.229 --> 53:54.296
¶ 'Cause tonight I'm gonna see

53:54.298 --> 53:57.332
¶ My ma cher amio

53:58.135 --> 53:59.735
Yeah, you might be right.

53:59.737 --> 54:02.237
¶ Jar and be gayo

54:02.239 --> 54:03.622
¶ Son of a gun

54:03.623 --> 54:05.006
¶ Well have big fun

54:05.008 --> 54:07.843
¶ On the bayou

54:11.281 --> 54:14.049
Oh, you got a live
one there, brother.

54:14.051 --> 54:15.150
Yes, sir.

54:18.222 --> 54:20.088
How long have
y'all been married?

54:20.090 --> 54:22.224
We're not married.

54:22.226 --> 54:23.258
Oh?

54:27.097 --> 54:29.998
Well brother if you don't
marry that girl, I will.

54:31.034 --> 54:32.901
¶ And be gayo

54:32.903 --> 54:34.052
¶ Son of a gun

54:34.053 --> 54:35.202
¶ We'll have big fun

54:35.205 --> 54:38.073
¶ On the bayou

54:42.279 --> 54:44.079
Home sweet home.

54:45.783 --> 54:46.948
Here ya go.

54:49.319 --> 54:50.952
I'm so thirsty.

54:52.189 --> 54:54.122
You want some water?

54:54.124 --> 54:55.157
Why not?

55:27.357 --> 55:28.390
Listening.

55:29.893 --> 55:32.994
¶ This old guitar

55:32.996 --> 55:36.097
¶ Is fallin' apart

55:37.034 --> 55:40.101
¶ I ain't got money

¶ What could I say

56:34.458 --> 56:37.225
That's so beautiful.

56:38.195 --> 56:41.396
Wait, don't put it
away, keep playin'.

56:41.398 --> 56:43.231
Is it one of yours?

56:43.233 --> 56:44.132
Yeah.

56:44.134 --> 56:45.467
It's nothing.

56:45.469 --> 56:47.969
It's not nothing.

56:47.971 --> 56:49.504
It's really pretty.

56:51.174 --> 56:52.657
Thanks.

56:52.658 --> 56:54.141
Will you keep
playin' a little more?

56:54.144 --> 56:56.011
You don't wanna hear me play.

56:56.013 --> 56:57.078
Yes, I do.

56:57.080 --> 56:58.380
Drunk.

57:03.320 --> 57:06.121
Come on, just a little more?

57:07.090 --> 57:08.990
What do you care?

57:14.398 --> 57:15.430
I care.

57:25.475 --> 57:26.508
Um.

57:27.945 --> 57:28.944
I'm sorry.

57:29.947 --> 57:30.946
I'm sorry.

57:45.228 --> 57:46.962
Smooth, Elliott.

58:29.139 --> 58:30.405
Oh, come on.

58:31.541 --> 58:34.175
It's disgusting down there.

58:35.145 --> 58:36.077
It's fine.

58:36.079 --> 58:37.696
No.

58:37.697 --> 58:39.314
Come on, the carpet is so gross.

58:39.316 --> 58:40.448
Get up here.

59:45.215 --> 59:48.416
It's my
birthday tomorrow.

59:49.553 --> 59:50.585
Really?

59:57.861 --> 59:59.494
Well, happy birthday.

01:00:33.497 --> 01:00:34.529
Oh, hey.

01:00:35.298 --> 01:00:36.297
Sorry.

01:00:36.299 --> 01:00:37.732
Sorry.

01:00:37.733 --> 01:00:39.166
Uh.
- It's all right.

01:00:39.169 --> 01:00:40.568
{Elliott] Uh.

01:00:40.570 --> 01:00:41.903
Just.

01:00:41.905 --> 01:00:43.555
Thank you.

01:00:43.556 --> 01:00:45.206
Breakfast was
included with the room,

01:00:45.208 --> 01:00:46.441
so I'll.

01:00:46.443 --> 01:00:47.642
Anyway.

01:00:47.644 --> 01:00:50.095
I'll.

01:01:00.590 --> 01:01:02.423
Hi, can we
get a coffee, please?

01:01:02.425 --> 01:01:04.292
Okay, just a regular coffee?

01:01:04.294 --> 01:01:06.378
- Yeah, that'd be great.
- To go?

01:01:06.379 --> 01:01:08.463
To go,
please, thank you.

01:01:09.666 --> 01:01:11.266
Do you need cream with this?

01:01:11.268 --> 01:01:13.501
Uh, no thank you.

01:01:14.437 --> 01:01:16.271
Thanks so much.
- Thank you.

01:01:29.219 --> 01:01:30.585
Got this for you.

01:01:30.587 --> 01:01:31.653
Well, uh,

01:01:31.655 --> 01:01:34.422
thank you kindly, Missy.

01:01:34.424 --> 01:01:36.191
Okay, so listen,
uh, this is, uh,

01:01:36.193 --> 01:01:38.310
this is just a quick fix.

01:01:38.311 --> 01:01:40.428
Now you gotta keep a really
close eye on that gauge.

01:01:40.430 --> 01:01:41.513
If it starts to overheat,

01:01:41.514 --> 01:01:42.597
why, you need to pull over

01:01:42.599 --> 01:01:44.265
and give it a rest.

01:01:44.267 --> 01:01:45.422
All right.

01:01:45.423 --> 01:01:46.578
We can do that.

01:01:46.579 --> 01:01:47.734
Now you can try
turning the heat on

01:01:47.737 --> 01:01:49.337
to see if that helps,

01:01:49.339 --> 01:01:50.572
but if that needle
goes to the red,

01:01:50.574 --> 01:01:52.273
why, you need to stop

01:01:52.275 --> 01:01:54.209
or you're gonna melt it.

01:01:54.211 --> 01:01:55.343
All right.

01:01:55.345 --> 01:01:56.478
Okay.

01:01:56.479 --> 01:01:57.612
Yeah, thank you so
much for doin' all this

01:01:57.614 --> 01:01:58.813
for us, Dale.

01:02:00.383 --> 01:02:02.217
You're welcome.

01:02:02.219 --> 01:02:04.469
That's a damn fine
cup of coffee.

01:02:04.470 --> 01:02:06.720
Hmm, yeah, there's a lot
of fine things in town there.

01:02:06.723 --> 01:02:08.490
Yeah, as a matter of fact,

01:02:08.491 --> 01:02:10.258
we, uh, stumbled into
Rick's last night.

01:02:10.260 --> 01:02:12.393
I think your dominoes game
is missin' ya a little bit.

01:02:12.395 --> 01:02:13.294
Is that right?

01:02:13.296 --> 01:02:14.395
Yes, sir.

01:02:22.505 --> 01:02:25.473
One too many whiskies
last night, amigo?

01:02:25.475 --> 01:02:26.774
Anyways, I, um,

01:02:29.512 --> 01:02:30.845
You know, I, uh,

01:02:32.015 --> 01:02:34.315
how can I say it?

01:02:34.317 --> 01:02:35.750
Oh, nothin'.

01:02:35.752 --> 01:02:37.785
It's fine, it's fine.

01:02:37.787 --> 01:02:40.421
You need somethin', Dale?

01:02:41.024 --> 01:02:44.425
Well, it, it's that damn tarp.

01:02:44.427 --> 01:02:46.544
What, you need help?

01:02:46.545 --> 01:02:48.662
Hell no, I don't
need no goddamn help!

01:02:48.665 --> 01:02:51.332
It's just that, well,

01:02:51.334 --> 01:02:53.735
it's hard to get it all, uh,

01:02:53.737 --> 01:02:55.536
tied down alone.

01:02:55.538 --> 01:02:57.038
Well why don't we have a look?

01:02:57.040 --> 01:02:59.474
Yeah, come on, let's go.

01:03:00.510 --> 01:03:01.542
Well, uh.

01:03:02.512 --> 01:03:03.711
Well okay.

01:04:16.486 --> 01:04:17.685
Coming
together as a nation

01:04:17.687 --> 01:04:19.887
as perhaps we never have.

01:04:20.890 --> 01:04:22.423
Hey, it's me.

01:04:22.425 --> 01:04:24.559
Um, I'm so happy I got through.

01:04:24.561 --> 01:04:26.244
We're driving.

01:04:26.245 --> 01:04:27.928
I'm with this guy, and it's, um,

01:04:27.931 --> 01:04:29.180
it's a long story,

01:04:29.181 --> 01:04:30.430
but I'm totally safe.

01:04:30.433 --> 01:04:32.433
It's gonna be a
few days, probably,

01:04:32.435 --> 01:04:33.468
or a couple days, I don't know

01:04:33.470 --> 01:04:35.504
til we're there.

01:04:35.505 --> 01:04:37.539
We're still a ways out.

01:04:37.540 --> 01:04:39.574
Um, Rita, tell Mom that
I love her, please.

01:04:41.378 --> 01:04:42.710
I'm gonna get back
as soon as I can.

01:04:42.712 --> 01:04:44.545
Thank you so much
for covering for me.

01:04:44.547 --> 01:04:46.848
I, I didn't know this was all.

01:04:46.850 --> 01:04:48.449
Joni.

01:04:48.451 --> 01:04:49.951
Joni, are you there?

01:04:49.952 --> 01:04:51.452
Major
Internet service providers

01:04:51.454 --> 01:04:53.921
are being contacted by the FBI.

01:04:53.923 --> 01:04:56.240
Hello, how are you?

01:04:56.241 --> 01:04:58.558
- I'm good, how are you?
- Good.

01:04:58.561 --> 01:05:00.962
Ah, two for a dollar, eh?

01:05:00.964 --> 01:05:01.829
This your place?

01:05:01.831 --> 01:05:03.314
Yes, it is.

01:05:03.315 --> 01:05:04.798
Ah, it's
really nice here.

01:05:04.801 --> 01:05:06.434
Where you from?

01:05:06.436 --> 01:05:08.669
Well, um,

01:05:08.671 --> 01:05:10.004
a ways from here.

01:05:10.005 --> 01:05:11.338
- Away from here?
- Yes, ma'am.

01:05:11.339 --> 01:05:12.672
Well we're glad
to have ya in Texas.

01:05:12.675 --> 01:05:13.975
Oh, thank you.

01:05:13.977 --> 01:05:15.543
Is Rita there?

01:05:15.545 --> 01:05:16.677
Rita went home.

01:05:16.679 --> 01:05:18.090
I'm here now.

01:05:18.091 --> 01:05:19.502
Kelly, did she tell
you what she needs?

01:05:19.503 --> 01:05:20.914
Mom needs to take the
blue pills in the morning

01:05:20.917 --> 01:05:22.183
with food--
- Yeah, yeah.

01:05:22.185 --> 01:05:23.785
She told me.

01:05:23.787 --> 01:05:25.136
Mom's okay.

01:05:25.137 --> 01:05:26.486
I, I mean, she's confused,

01:05:26.489 --> 01:05:28.623
but she's okay, Joni.

01:05:28.625 --> 01:05:30.591
Just get back safe, okay?

01:05:30.593 --> 01:05:32.827
Okay, tell Mom that
I'm gonna be back,

01:05:32.829 --> 01:05:34.695
I love her.

01:05:34.697 --> 01:05:36.731
I'll talk to you later.

01:05:40.837 --> 01:05:42.737
Are you all
right there, partner?

01:05:42.739 --> 01:05:44.806
Yeah, I'm fine.

01:05:44.808 --> 01:05:46.841
Hey,
you wanna play one?

01:05:46.843 --> 01:05:49.777
No, not, not right now.

01:05:49.779 --> 01:05:51.829
In history,

01:05:51.830 --> 01:05:53.880
sports will be a footnote of
secondary importance perhaps.

01:05:55.885 --> 01:05:56.984
When we peek back at these days,

01:05:56.986 --> 01:05:59.454
but still

01:05:59.456 --> 01:06:02.723
reasons of public safety
closures.

01:06:02.725 --> 01:06:03.925
So you don't go anywhere

01:06:03.927 --> 01:06:06.494
you don't absolutely need to go.

01:06:06.496 --> 01:06:10.598
Again, Major League baseball
has canceled its games tonight.

01:06:10.600 --> 01:06:13.501
The first time a
whole slate of games

01:06:13.503 --> 01:06:17.472
have been canceled
since D-Day in 1944.

01:06:17.474 --> 01:06:19.474
The cancellations
include, of course,

01:06:19.475 --> 01:06:21.475
the White Sox and Yankees,
which was scheduled

01:06:21.478 --> 01:06:22.844
for the Bronx tonight.

01:06:22.846 --> 01:06:24.946
Other sports, including NASCAR,

01:06:24.948 --> 01:06:28.049
has canceled qualifying rounds
for this weekend's race.

01:06:28.051 --> 01:06:29.984
Minor League baseball
playoff games

01:06:29.986 --> 01:06:32.487
have been canceled indefinitely.

01:06:32.489 --> 01:06:35.756
The PGA has canceled
its tour dates.

01:06:35.758 --> 01:06:38.526
Thoroughbred racing
have all been canceled.

01:06:38.528 --> 01:06:40.695
Essentially, arenas or venues

01:06:40.697 --> 01:06:43.064
where large amounts of
people typically gather

01:06:43.066 --> 01:06:46.267
have been closed for safety.

01:06:50.773 --> 01:06:51.639
Um.

01:06:55.512 --> 01:06:58.513
Do you know Hello Stranger?

01:06:58.515 --> 01:06:59.280
How's that go?

01:06:59.282 --> 01:07:01.682
¶ Hello, stranger

01:07:01.684 --> 01:07:05.786
¶ Put your lovin' hand in mine

01:07:07.056 --> 01:07:08.689
Yeah!

01:07:08.691 --> 01:07:11.058
¶ Hello, stranger

01:07:11.060 --> 01:07:13.027
¶ Put your lovin' hand in mine

01:07:13.029 --> 01:07:15.796
¶ Hello, stranger

01:07:15.798 --> 01:07:18.933
¶ Put your lovin' hand in mine

01:07:18.935 --> 01:07:21.669
¶ You are a stranger

01:07:21.671 --> 01:07:24.639
¶ But you're a pal of mine

01:07:24.641 --> 01:07:25.940
¶ Get up, rounder

01:07:25.942 --> 01:07:27.108
¶ Get up, rounder

01:07:27.110 --> 01:07:28.876
¶ Workin' man lay down

01:07:28.878 --> 01:07:31.078
¶ Get up, rounder

01:07:31.080 --> 01:07:34.682
¶ Let a workin' man lay down

01:07:34.684 --> 01:07:37.685
¶ You are a rounder

01:07:37.687 --> 01:07:40.922
¶ You're all out and down

01:07:40.924 --> 01:07:42.323
Businesses remain closed

01:07:42.325 --> 01:07:44.859
with workers staying home today,

01:07:44.861 --> 01:07:46.827
taking their cue,
perhaps, from Wall Street,

01:07:46.829 --> 01:07:48.863
which remains closed.

01:07:48.865 --> 01:07:50.665
World Trade Center

01:07:50.667 --> 01:07:54.902
most horrible for this country.

01:07:56.639 --> 01:07:59.740
Hey, I think it's
my turn for gas next, yeah?

01:07:59.742 --> 01:08:02.043
Yeah, this
thing really eats it up.

01:08:02.045 --> 01:08:03.495
I was just wondering, I,

01:08:03.496 --> 01:08:04.946
I'm a little low
on cash right now.

01:08:04.948 --> 01:08:07.114
Is it all right if, um,

01:08:07.116 --> 01:08:08.583
you spot me?

01:08:10.587 --> 01:08:11.619
Really?

01:08:11.621 --> 01:08:16.122
I was actually about to
ask you the same thing.

01:08:16.125 --> 01:08:17.892
Wait, seriously?

01:08:17.894 --> 01:08:19.549
Yeah.

01:08:19.550 --> 01:08:21.205
I'll be fine when
I get to New York,

01:08:21.206 --> 01:08:22.861
but I'm kinda busted right now.

01:08:31.006 --> 01:08:35.609
Great, now we're gonna have
to stop again in 10 minutes.

01:08:35.979 --> 01:08:37.712
Don't worry about me.

01:08:37.714 --> 01:08:39.046
Mm hmm.

01:08:41.984 --> 01:08:44.618
You should really
get that checked out!

01:08:44.621 --> 01:08:46.821
You're not a kid anymore.

01:09:05.975 --> 01:09:08.743
Oh God, I'm so hungry.

01:09:08.745 --> 01:09:10.845
Wait.

01:09:10.846 --> 01:09:11.879
Look.

01:09:12.849 --> 01:09:13.814
What?

01:09:13.816 --> 01:09:15.149
Let's go.

01:09:15.151 --> 01:09:16.751
Come on!
- Hey!

01:09:18.020 --> 01:09:19.953
Hi, need some help?

01:09:19.956 --> 01:09:22.823
Yeah, that'd be great.

01:09:29.432 --> 01:09:31.932
Moose hat!

01:09:42.812 --> 01:09:44.761
What's all this?

01:09:44.763 --> 01:09:46.712
Happy birthday!

01:09:46.716 --> 01:09:48.448
Make a wish.

01:09:48.451 --> 01:09:49.917
You crazy.

01:09:54.090 --> 01:09:55.222
- Woo!
- Woo!

01:09:58.795 --> 01:10:01.962
Elliott, so this
is Bianca and Emily.

01:10:01.964 --> 01:10:02.941
Elliott.

01:10:02.942 --> 01:10:03.919
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

01:10:03.920 --> 01:10:04.897
Like your hat.

01:10:06.368 --> 01:10:07.834
And they're on
their way from San Francisco

01:10:07.837 --> 01:10:09.136
to Tennessee?

01:10:09.138 --> 01:10:10.621
Tennessee, right.

01:10:10.622 --> 01:10:12.105
Well, to be fair,
it's also Virginia.

01:10:12.108 --> 01:10:14.075
Yeah, technically, it's both.

01:10:14.077 --> 01:10:16.977
Do you guys want some of this?

01:10:16.979 --> 01:10:18.846
We're going to my
folks' place in Bristol.

01:10:18.848 --> 01:10:21.032
Yeah, it's right
on the border.

01:10:21.033 --> 01:10:23.217
It's half in Tennessee
and half in Virginia.

01:10:23.219 --> 01:10:26.120
So the girls need a ride,

01:10:26.122 --> 01:10:27.121
and

01:10:28.224 --> 01:10:30.291
they also offered

01:10:30.293 --> 01:10:31.959
to pay for gas.

01:10:36.999 --> 01:10:38.032
Okay.

01:10:43.005 --> 01:10:44.138
There it is.

01:10:49.145 --> 01:10:51.278
Hairpin triggers, huh?

01:10:52.281 --> 01:10:54.148
Yeah.

01:10:54.149 --> 01:10:56.016
What, are those
all your costumes?

01:11:08.765 --> 01:11:12.800
Man, your birthday is
never gonna be the same, huh?

01:11:12.802 --> 01:11:14.335
Guess not.

01:11:14.337 --> 01:11:16.270
Stupid terrorists.

01:11:18.241 --> 01:11:20.241
So San Fran, huh?

01:11:20.243 --> 01:11:23.077
Oh, don't call it San Fran.

01:11:23.079 --> 01:11:25.045
You're such a freak.

01:11:25.047 --> 01:11:26.113
You love it.

01:11:26.115 --> 01:11:27.915
I love it.

01:11:27.917 --> 01:11:29.917
How long have you
two been together?

01:11:29.919 --> 01:11:31.318
A little
over three years?

01:11:31.320 --> 01:11:32.186
About, yeah.

01:11:32.188 --> 01:11:33.880
Three.

01:11:33.881 --> 01:11:35.573
Ah, that's a long time.

01:11:35.574 --> 01:11:37.266
Yeah, it takes
a national tragedy

01:11:37.267 --> 01:11:38.959
for Bianca to introduce
me to her family.

01:11:38.961 --> 01:11:41.011
Shut up.

01:11:41.012 --> 01:11:43.062
I'm just joking,
babe, you know that.

01:11:43.065 --> 01:11:46.033
Bianca's gonna come
out to her family.

01:11:46.035 --> 01:11:47.868
Oh, they don't know?

01:11:47.870 --> 01:11:50.171
It should be interesting
to say the least.

01:11:50.173 --> 01:11:51.572
Plus, I wanna see my cousin.

01:11:51.574 --> 01:11:52.785
He's in the Reserves,

01:11:52.786 --> 01:11:53.997
and my dad keeps saying
he's gonna get called up

01:11:53.998 --> 01:11:55.209
and stuff like that.

01:11:55.211 --> 01:11:57.945
And stuff like that.

01:12:00.082 --> 01:12:02.116
Wait, so you guys
hitched all the way here?

01:12:02.118 --> 01:12:03.017
Yeah.

01:12:03.019 --> 01:12:03.918
Yeah!

01:12:03.920 --> 01:12:04.908
It's been cool.

01:12:04.909 --> 01:12:05.897
Like, total strangers
are so nice.

01:12:05.898 --> 01:12:06.886
It's kind of amazing.

01:12:06.889 --> 01:12:07.588
Yeah.

01:12:07.590 --> 01:12:09.240
It's like

01:12:09.241 --> 01:12:10.891
everyone's kind of looking
out for each other,

01:12:10.893 --> 01:12:11.926
you know?

01:12:14.230 --> 01:12:16.230
Wait, I almost forgot.

01:12:16.232 --> 01:12:19.366
All right, so I took Polaroids

01:12:19.368 --> 01:12:21.235
of everyone we met.

01:12:21.237 --> 01:12:22.903
With the moose hat?

01:12:22.905 --> 01:12:24.338
Oh, this one.

01:12:24.340 --> 01:12:25.339
He looked at me.

01:12:33.249 --> 01:12:37.251
¶ Layin' with the one I love

01:12:38.154 --> 01:12:42.089
¶ Lookin' at the moon above

01:12:43.259 --> 01:12:45.993
¶ Bein' where we really

01:12:45.995 --> 01:12:48.395
¶ Want to be

01:12:52.034 --> 01:12:55.069
¶ The autumn winds for now

01:12:55.071 --> 01:12:58.038
¶ Are still

01:12:58.040 --> 01:12:59.173
You okay?

01:12:59.175 --> 01:13:01.408
Your reflexes need some work.

01:13:01.410 --> 01:13:03.244
Here, try again.

01:13:07.250 --> 01:13:08.649
There we go!

01:13:08.651 --> 01:13:10.951
You're an idiot!

01:13:10.953 --> 01:13:12.286
I love you guys.

01:13:14.924 --> 01:13:17.958
¶ And shine on me

01:13:23.432 --> 01:13:25.399
I want you all to know

01:13:25.401 --> 01:13:27.301
that America today

01:13:27.303 --> 01:13:29.403
is on bended knee

01:13:29.405 --> 01:13:31.205
in prayer for the people

01:13:31.207 --> 01:13:33.440
whose lives were lost here,

01:13:33.442 --> 01:13:36.277
for the workers who work here.

01:13:37.980 --> 01:13:39.313
I can hear you!

01:13:41.317 --> 01:13:42.950
I can hear you.

01:13:42.952 --> 01:13:45.252
The rest of the world hears you.

01:13:45.254 --> 01:13:48.355
And the people who knocked
these buildings down

01:13:48.357 --> 01:13:50.190
will hear all of us soon.

01:13:53.996 --> 01:13:55.195
USA!

01:13:55.197 --> 01:13:56.263
USA!

01:15:27.289 --> 01:15:28.322
Okay.

01:15:30.292 --> 01:15:33.260
No, not here, not
here, not here.

01:15:36.432 --> 01:15:37.297
Hey.

01:15:37.299 --> 01:15:38.666
Hey.

01:15:38.667 --> 01:15:40.034
Mind if I borrow
your restroom?

01:15:40.036 --> 01:15:41.502
Sure.

01:15:41.504 --> 01:15:43.804
That was San Francisco.

01:15:43.806 --> 01:15:46.040
Hey, hot
off the presses.

01:15:46.042 --> 01:15:47.508
- Oh thank you so much.
- Can't you let go on

01:15:47.510 --> 01:15:49.443
the road with an empty stomach.

01:15:51.447 --> 01:15:55.082
So, so I understand
y'all headed to New York.

01:15:55.084 --> 01:15:56.684
- Yes, sir.
- Mm hmm.

01:15:56.685 --> 01:15:58.285
I can only imagine
what it's like there.

01:15:58.287 --> 01:16:00.454
I mean, even this
city feels different.

01:16:00.456 --> 01:16:01.321
It does?

01:16:01.323 --> 01:16:02.690
Oh yeah.

01:16:02.691 --> 01:16:04.058
That whole Virginia
versus Tennessee thing

01:16:04.060 --> 01:16:05.326
seems to be gone.

01:16:05.327 --> 01:16:06.593
It, it feels more united.

01:16:06.595 --> 01:16:08.328
Stuff like that.

01:16:08.330 --> 01:16:10.831
Oh, that was never
such a big deal.

01:16:10.833 --> 01:16:12.199
Everybody have
everything you need?

01:16:12.201 --> 01:16:13.467
There's lots more, right, Mike?

01:16:13.469 --> 01:16:15.169
Oh, lots more.

01:16:16.138 --> 01:16:17.504
This is
plenty, thank you.

01:16:17.506 --> 01:16:19.206
Thanks.

01:16:25.381 --> 01:16:26.413
Jimmy,

01:16:26.415 --> 01:16:30.417
switch seats with
your cousin, will you?

01:16:30.419 --> 01:16:33.454
I want to sit next
to my daughter.

01:16:53.275 --> 01:16:55.275
Is something
wrong with the food?

01:16:55.277 --> 01:16:57.511
Everything's fine, dear.

01:17:01.283 --> 01:17:03.650
Um, have you heard anything?

01:17:03.652 --> 01:17:05.018
Yeah, they say on the news

01:17:05.019 --> 01:17:06.385
we're gonna bomb the
shit out of those guys.

01:17:06.388 --> 01:17:08.122
Jimmy, please.

01:17:08.891 --> 01:17:10.708
I ain't sayin' we
shouldn't retaliate,

01:17:10.709 --> 01:17:12.526
I'm just askin' you to
watch your language.

01:17:12.528 --> 01:17:14.261
We don't have to get into it.

01:17:14.263 --> 01:17:16.263
I'm impressed with Bush.

01:17:16.265 --> 01:17:19.299
I'm glad we've got a strong
leader in office right now.

01:17:19.301 --> 01:17:20.634
I'm sure our guests
would rather not

01:17:20.636 --> 01:17:22.536
discuss politics right now.

01:17:22.538 --> 01:17:24.204
Darlin', all I'm sayin' is

01:17:24.206 --> 01:17:25.906
the people who did this

01:17:25.907 --> 01:17:27.607
need to be held responsible.
- Dad, come on.

01:17:27.610 --> 01:17:29.543
And I think it's important

01:17:29.545 --> 01:17:30.911
that we have somebody in office

01:17:30.913 --> 01:17:32.346
who vowed to do that.

01:17:32.348 --> 01:17:34.915
That's right.

01:17:34.916 --> 01:17:37.483
Don't you think we should
get all the information first?

01:17:39.288 --> 01:17:40.343
Well, here's what I think,

01:17:40.344 --> 01:17:41.399
young lady.
- We don't have

01:17:41.400 --> 01:17:42.455
to get into it.

01:17:46.462 --> 01:17:48.428
I want to hear all about you.

01:17:48.430 --> 01:17:50.330
We're so happy that
you came back home.

01:17:50.332 --> 01:17:53.534
We finally get to
meet your roommate.

01:17:59.575 --> 01:18:00.741
Mom, Daddy,

01:18:02.611 --> 01:18:04.178
actually, um,

01:18:05.447 --> 01:18:07.414
I came back to tell
you guys something.

01:18:07.416 --> 01:18:09.066
Is everything okay, baby?

01:18:09.067 --> 01:18:10.717
- Mom, everything's fine.
- Don't talk to your mother

01:18:10.719 --> 01:18:11.752
like that.

01:18:13.422 --> 01:18:14.555
I'm sorry.

01:18:15.624 --> 01:18:16.657
I'm sorry.

01:18:17.660 --> 01:18:19.726
Um, on Tuesday morning,

01:18:21.730 --> 01:18:23.697
our friend Angel

01:18:23.699 --> 01:18:26.700
called us and told
us to turn on the TV,

01:18:26.702 --> 01:18:28.368
so we did,

01:18:28.370 --> 01:18:30.470
and that morning,
we just sat there,

01:18:30.472 --> 01:18:31.738
and we watched.

01:18:32.741 --> 01:18:33.774
For hours.

01:18:35.377 --> 01:18:37.744
Together, trying to
make sense of it all.

01:18:46.755 --> 01:18:47.788
I'm sorry.

01:18:48.691 --> 01:18:49.723
I am.

01:18:51.760 --> 01:18:53.760
I mean, once we figured
out that you were okay,

01:18:53.762 --> 01:18:57.231
and everyone that
we knew was okay,

01:18:58.434 --> 01:19:01.368
I just wanted to sit
there with her, you know?

01:19:01.370 --> 01:19:03.637
And just be there with her.

01:19:04.740 --> 01:19:06.673
And I couldn't imagine

01:19:06.675 --> 01:19:08.275
not having her

01:19:08.777 --> 01:19:11.245
right there by my side.

01:19:14.416 --> 01:19:17.684
For so long, I didn't
have anybody but her.

01:19:17.686 --> 01:19:22.289
And it was so hard to
be out there by myself.

01:19:23.025 --> 01:19:24.324
I guess what I'm
trying to say is that

01:19:24.326 --> 01:19:26.660
Emily is my girlfriend, Dad.

01:19:27.663 --> 01:19:28.795
I'm sorry?

01:19:29.832 --> 01:19:32.566
And I, and I love her

01:19:32.568 --> 01:19:35.535
with everything that I am.

01:19:35.537 --> 01:19:37.537
I don't know how to explain it.

01:19:37.539 --> 01:19:38.438
There's so many--
- No, no, no, no,

01:19:38.440 --> 01:19:39.439
wait a minute.

01:19:39.441 --> 01:19:40.807
Are you serious, Bianca?

01:19:40.809 --> 01:19:42.142
Let's just
hang on a second.

01:19:42.143 --> 01:19:43.476
No, no, with,
with, with everything

01:19:43.479 --> 01:19:46.346
that is goin' on right now,

01:19:46.348 --> 01:19:48.448
this is what you decide to do?

01:19:48.450 --> 01:19:50.417
It's not a decision.

01:19:50.418 --> 01:19:52.385
I am talkin' to my
daughter, young lady!

01:19:52.388 --> 01:19:53.420
Everybody take a breath.

01:19:53.422 --> 01:19:54.821
Take a breath, okay?

01:19:54.823 --> 01:19:56.723
We have guests here.

01:19:59.295 --> 01:20:00.694
She's happy.

01:20:00.696 --> 01:20:01.828
Excuse me?

01:20:03.699 --> 01:20:05.733
They're happy together.

01:20:05.734 --> 01:20:07.768
- Who are you to--
- Mike, please.

01:20:09.705 --> 01:20:12.406
What about everything
they have to face?

01:20:12.408 --> 01:20:13.073
Hmm?

01:20:15.311 --> 01:20:16.610
I guess they'll face it.

01:20:16.612 --> 01:20:17.744
What about what
we've been through,

01:20:17.746 --> 01:20:19.579
what we deal with?

01:20:20.616 --> 01:20:22.582
Looks every goddamn place we go.

01:20:22.584 --> 01:20:24.851
People spittin' in my face.

01:20:25.888 --> 01:20:29.323
I think we should,
we should go.

01:20:29.325 --> 01:20:31.625
You should definitely go.

01:20:37.633 --> 01:20:41.368
I apologize, I don't
mean any disrespect.

01:20:41.370 --> 01:20:42.402
It's just,

01:20:44.740 --> 01:20:47.741
all these people
who've just died.

01:20:49.478 --> 01:20:52.879
Some have lost their
whole families, sir.

01:20:56.885 --> 01:20:58.819
Yours is right here.

01:21:01.590 --> 01:21:02.456
Excuse me.

01:21:21.143 --> 01:21:23.977
Wait,
wait, wait, wait.

01:21:25.447 --> 01:21:26.480
Oh my God!

01:21:30.753 --> 01:21:33.170
It's yours.

01:22:05.788 --> 01:22:07.421
Hey, I bet there's
a bunch of bears

01:22:07.423 --> 01:22:09.923
and stuff like that up here.

01:22:09.925 --> 01:22:11.625
Stuff like that?

01:22:15.697 --> 01:22:16.963
What a trip.

01:22:18.567 --> 01:22:20.500
Yeah, what a trip.

01:22:23.439 --> 01:22:25.089
Hey, um,

01:22:25.090 --> 01:22:26.740
did you get any
sleep last night?

01:22:26.742 --> 01:22:28.475
No.

01:22:28.477 --> 01:22:31.511
How much longer, you
think, til we get there?

01:22:31.513 --> 01:22:32.612
Uh,

01:22:32.614 --> 01:22:34.614
seven or eight hours.

01:22:34.616 --> 01:22:37.617
If the van holds up
on these hills anyway.

01:22:37.619 --> 01:22:41.855
I can't really imagine
driving through the night again.

01:22:44.726 --> 01:22:46.660
And, honestly, I don't

01:22:46.662 --> 01:22:48.795
feel like I'm ready yet to

01:22:48.797 --> 01:22:51.598
be back and deal
with everything.

01:22:51.600 --> 01:22:52.899
Well,

01:22:52.901 --> 01:22:54.034
we can split it up.

01:22:54.036 --> 01:22:55.635
Really?

01:22:55.637 --> 01:22:58.972
Don't you have to
get back to the band?

01:22:58.974 --> 01:23:01.775
I don't think
anybody in New York's

01:23:01.776 --> 01:23:04.577
too worried about the
hairpin Triggers right now.

01:23:05.747 --> 01:23:07.781
Honestly, neither am I.

01:23:21.697 --> 01:23:24.564
¶ Oh, Shenandoah

01:23:24.566 --> 01:23:27.834
¶ I long to see you

01:23:27.836 --> 01:23:29.903
¶ Away

¶ I long to see you

01:23:41.049 --> 01:23:43.683
¶ Away

01:23:43.685 --> 01:23:46.953
¶ I'm bound away

¶ 'Cross the wide

¶ Oh, Shenandoah

01:23:59.601 --> 01:24:02.936
¶ I love your daughter

01:24:02.938 --> 01:24:05.739

¶ You rolling river

¶ Oh, Shenandoah

01:24:12.114 --> 01:24:15.815
¶ I'd cross your waters

¶ Away

01:24:32.834 --> 01:24:34.484
Welcome to the Mountain.

01:24:34.485 --> 01:24:36.135
- Ah, thank you so much.
- My friends are your friends.

01:24:36.138 --> 01:24:37.737
Enjoy yourself.

01:24:37.739 --> 01:24:39.139
Stay as long as you need to.

01:24:39.141 --> 01:24:40.807
Thank you.

01:24:44.646 --> 01:24:46.646
Last
rental car on the whole lot.

01:24:46.648 --> 01:24:47.781
That's unbelievable, man.

01:24:47.783 --> 01:24:49.583
Got real lucky.

01:24:51.353 --> 01:24:53.603
So how do you pronounce it?

01:24:53.604 --> 01:24:55.854
Because I heard
Appalachia and Appalachah.

01:24:55.857 --> 01:24:57.123
- Well.
- Stopped in the first place

01:24:57.125 --> 01:24:58.024
I saw.

01:24:58.026 --> 01:24:59.125
Gave blood.

01:24:59.861 --> 01:25:02.445
What else could I do?

01:25:02.446 --> 01:25:05.030
That's really,
that's really sweet of you.

01:25:05.834 --> 01:25:07.968
There's so many people here.

01:25:07.970 --> 01:25:09.603
Sure are.

01:25:12.107 --> 01:25:14.107
You know
what I'm thinkin'?

01:25:14.109 --> 01:25:15.675
What's that?

01:25:15.677 --> 01:25:18.211
We gotta bring back the folk.

01:25:21.950 --> 01:25:22.849
What do you think?

01:25:22.851 --> 01:25:24.117
What song?

01:25:24.118 --> 01:25:25.384
- Um.
- What have ya got?

01:25:25.387 --> 01:25:27.654
All right, somethin',
how 'bout, uh,

01:25:27.656 --> 01:25:28.888
how 'bout a singalong?

01:25:28.890 --> 01:25:32.726
Yeah!

01:25:34.029 --> 01:25:35.762
Yeah, I want
you to sing along.

01:25:35.764 --> 01:25:37.130
Just repeat every line.

01:25:37.132 --> 01:25:40.100
That way you never
get one wrong.

01:25:42.137 --> 01:25:43.136
¶ You gotta walk

01:25:43.138 --> 01:25:44.170
¶ You gotta walk

01:25:44.172 --> 01:25:45.739
¶ That lonesome valley

01:25:45.741 --> 01:25:47.040
¶ That lonesome valley

01:25:47.042 --> 01:25:48.642
¶ You gotta walk

01:25:48.644 --> 01:25:49.709
¶ You gotta walk

01:25:49.711 --> 01:25:50.910
¶ It by yourself

01:25:50.912 --> 01:25:52.646
¶ It by yourself

01:25:52.648 --> 01:25:53.880
¶ Nobody here

01:25:53.882 --> 01:25:54.914
¶ Nobody here

01:25:54.916 --> 01:25:56.149
¶ Can walk it for you

01:25:56.151 --> 01:25:57.784
¶ Can walk it for you

01:25:57.786 --> 01:25:59.986
¶ You got to walk

01:25:59.988 --> 01:26:02.889
¶ It by yourself

01:26:02.891 --> 01:26:04.057
¶ Everybody's gotta walk

01:26:04.059 --> 01:26:05.158
¶ Everybody's gotta walk

01:26:05.160 --> 01:26:06.426
¶ That lonesome valley

01:26:06.428 --> 01:26:07.927
¶ That lonesome valley

01:26:07.929 --> 01:26:09.162
¶ You got to walk

01:26:09.164 --> 01:26:10.196
¶ You got to walk

01:26:10.198 --> 01:26:11.731
¶ It by yourself

01:26:11.733 --> 01:26:13.667
¶ It by yourself

01:27:21.069 --> 01:27:22.869
Breaker breaker one-nine.

01:27:22.871 --> 01:27:24.871
Uh, what's your 20?

01:27:24.873 --> 01:27:28.041
Yeah, we've been on
the road a while.

01:27:28.910 --> 01:27:30.510
Yeah, she's all right.

01:27:30.512 --> 01:27:31.795
Little bit of a pain in the ass,

01:27:31.796 --> 01:27:33.079
but I don't mind.

01:27:33.982 --> 01:27:35.515
You bet.

01:27:35.517 --> 01:27:36.683
Catch ya later.

01:27:36.684 --> 01:27:37.850
Come on in front.

01:28:01.042 --> 01:28:03.042
In a
sign of unprecedented solidarity

01:28:03.044 --> 01:28:05.278
with the United States,
the United Kingdom,

01:28:05.280 --> 01:28:07.046
and the entirety of Europe,

01:28:07.048 --> 01:28:09.916
has agreed to take a
moment of silence today.

01:28:09.918 --> 01:28:12.051
Millions of people
across many nations,

01:28:12.053 --> 01:28:14.187
all standing in
support of America,

01:28:14.189 --> 01:28:16.956
and in honor of those of
who have lost their lives.

01:28:16.958 --> 01:28:18.858
So, please now, we ask that you

01:28:18.860 --> 01:28:20.794
take such a moment of silence

01:28:20.796 --> 01:28:22.028
along with us.

01:30:15.176 --> 01:30:16.676
You all right?

01:30:27.489 --> 01:30:29.322
Yeah, all right.

01:31:10.231 --> 01:31:12.031
This is you.

01:31:12.033 --> 01:31:13.066
Yeah.

01:31:13.501 --> 01:31:14.968
It's nice.

01:31:15.737 --> 01:31:16.602
Thanks.

01:31:19.507 --> 01:31:22.275
Feels strange to be back.

01:31:27.148 --> 01:31:28.548
You'll be okay.

01:31:30.552 --> 01:31:31.584
Thanks.

01:31:35.056 --> 01:31:36.189
Come here.

01:31:54.776 --> 01:31:56.509
You sure you don't want
me to take the van?

01:31:56.511 --> 01:31:59.545
Oh no, they're
comin' to get it.

01:32:00.582 --> 01:32:02.315
Did you wanna use the bathroom?

01:32:02.317 --> 01:32:04.150
I'm sure you have to pee.

01:32:04.152 --> 01:32:06.019
- I'm good.
- Right.

01:32:08.390 --> 01:32:09.455
Um, here.

01:32:11.393 --> 01:32:12.909
What's this?

01:32:12.910 --> 01:32:14.426
Uh, a song I've
been workin' on.

01:32:14.429 --> 01:32:16.496
Thought maybe you could
help me out with it.

01:32:16.498 --> 01:32:18.164
Really?

01:32:18.166 --> 01:32:19.165
Really.

01:32:19.167 --> 01:32:20.366
You're great.

01:32:21.503 --> 01:32:22.568
Keep goin'.

01:32:26.508 --> 01:32:27.540
Thanks.

01:32:29.310 --> 01:32:30.343
Oh.

01:32:38.186 --> 01:32:40.153
How could I forget?

01:32:41.189 --> 01:32:43.156
Well, she made it.

01:32:43.158 --> 01:32:45.558
Of course she made it.

01:32:45.560 --> 01:32:48.061
We're all gonna make it.

01:32:52.133 --> 01:32:53.166
Mom?

01:35:05.466 --> 01:35:06.432
Good to go?

01:35:08.436 --> 01:35:09.869
Okay.

01:35:09.870 --> 01:35:11.303
All right.

01:35:16.311 --> 01:35:19.378
¶ This old guitar

01:35:19.380 --> 01:35:22.481
¶ Is falling apart

01:35:22.483 --> 01:35:25.618
¶ I don't have the money

01:35:25.620 --> 01:35:28.354
¶ To mend it

01:35:29.390 --> 01:35:32.458
¶ This whole life

01:35:32.460 --> 01:35:35.461
¶ Is passing me by

01:35:35.463 --> 01:35:38.431
¶ I got no ideas

01:35:38.433 --> 01:35:42.268
¶ How to change it

01:35:42.270 --> 01:35:45.538
¶ So if this be the last words

01:35:45.540 --> 01:35:48.641
¶ That I ever write

01:35:48.643 --> 01:35:50.309
¶ Then please

01:35:50.311 --> 01:35:54.347
¶ Don't judge them to harshly

01:35:55.483 --> 01:35:58.751
¶ If this be the last breath

01:35:58.753 --> 01:36:01.787
¶ I ever take

01:36:01.789 --> 01:36:03.456
¶ I hope

01:36:03.458 --> 01:36:05.258
¶ You will remember

01:36:05.260 --> 01:36:07.593
¶ Me fondly

01:36:15.370 --> 01:36:18.771
¶ It was early September

01:36:18.773 --> 01:36:22.041
¶ When we hit the ground

01:36:22.043 --> 01:36:25.044
¶ And we drove
through the waters

01:36:25.046 --> 01:36:28.648
¶ And we drove through towns

01:36:28.650 --> 01:36:31.450
¶ And we found more life

01:36:31.452 --> 01:36:35.288
¶ Than anybody ever does

01:36:35.290 --> 01:36:37.790
¶ So we just

01:36:37.792 --> 01:36:40.593
¶ Kept movin'

01:36:45.466 --> 01:36:48.067
¶ We saw the colors

01:36:48.069 --> 01:36:51.804
¶ And the changin' of the days

01:36:51.806 --> 01:36:54.373
¶ And we scaled the walls

01:36:54.375 --> 01:36:58.377
¶ Where the new soldiers played

01:36:58.379 --> 01:37:00.579
¶ And they're all too young

01:37:00.581 --> 01:37:04.583
¶ But they mean what they say

01:37:04.585 --> 01:37:07.453
¶ So we just

01:37:07.455 --> 01:37:09.922
¶ Kept movin'

01:37:14.095 --> 01:37:17.463
¶ And I wish I had known you

01:37:17.465 --> 01:37:20.599
¶ When the world was still young

01:37:20.601 --> 01:37:23.636
¶ Before religion so reckless

01:37:23.638 --> 01:37:26.872
¶ Tried to shoot out the sun

01:37:26.874 --> 01:37:29.809
¶ And they say we'll be standin'

01:37:29.811 --> 01:37:33.679
¶ When the last war is won

01:37:33.681 --> 01:37:36.515
¶ But will we

01:37:36.517 --> 01:37:38.884
¶ Be worthy

01:37:50.131 --> 01:37:51.931
¶ Oh

01:37:56.637 --> 01:37:58.671
¶ Ooh

01:38:03.578 --> 01:38:05.611
¶ Ooh

01:38:12.787 --> 01:38:16.389
¶ If you were my future

01:38:16.391 --> 01:38:19.658
¶ I'd hold you to my coat

01:38:19.660 --> 01:38:22.795
¶ And fold you into it

01:38:22.797 --> 01:38:25.965
¶ And never let go

01:38:25.967 --> 01:38:28.601
¶ And walk through this land

01:38:28.603 --> 01:38:32.638
¶ With our message of hope

01:38:32.640 --> 01:38:35.808
¶ Just laughin'

01:38:35.810 --> 01:38:38.644
¶ And singin'

01:38:43.551 --> 01:38:45.551
¶ Ooh

01:38:50.691 --> 01:38:52.691
¶ Ooh

01:38:57.698 --> 01:38:59.732
¶ Ooh

01:39:04.806 --> 01:39:06.839
¶ Ooh

01:39:18.853 --> 01:39:20.236
Gotta start it

01:39:20.237 --> 01:39:21.620
from the beginning?
- It was early September.

01:39:21.622 --> 01:39:22.988
¶ It was early
