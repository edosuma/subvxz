01:14.856 --> 01:16.066
Why aren't you at work?

01:16.525 --> 01:18.277
Luschek never showed.

01:18.360 --> 01:20.201
Probably passed out
in his own vomit somewhere.

01:20.820 --> 01:23.491
So you chose to
come in here and help?

01:23.658 --> 01:25.409
Yeah. Figured you could use it.
It's Thanksgiving.

01:25.493 --> 01:26.786
Then get your
ass off my counter

01:26.868 --> 01:29.079
and help Gina pull the turkeys
out of the freezer.

01:29.163 --> 01:31.039
Shit, we got
real turkey this year!

01:31.915 --> 01:35.043
We got trimmings from the factory.
50 cents a pound.

01:35.169 --> 01:37.546
Trimmings? Jesus.
The shit no one else wants.

01:37.672 --> 01:39.674
That's a bag of turkey
assholes right there.

01:39.757 --> 01:41.759
The whole meal has to come
in at $1.05 a prisoner.

01:41.842 --> 01:44.679
Taxpayers don't give
a shit if it's a holiday.

01:44.804 --> 01:46.472
We're the bad guys.

01:55.648 --> 01:57.024
Pig-fucker.

02:06.534 --> 02:08.494
Brown the onions for the gravy.

02:37.773 --> 02:39.525
SOPHIA: That too hot, baby?

02:41.485 --> 02:44.780
No, it's perfect.

02:45.489 --> 02:47.032
I feel so good.

02:47.742 --> 02:49.909
SISTER INGALLS: "Frequent
blinking may actually be a way

02:50.035 --> 02:52.329
"for your brain to
rest while you're awake."

02:52.413 --> 02:54.331
Wakeful rest, huh?

02:54.456 --> 02:55.833
You okay, honey?

02:57.251 --> 02:59.795
(VOICE BREAKING) It's just being
touched by another person.

03:03.883 --> 03:05.551
SOPHIA: I get it.
Thanks.

03:05.634 --> 03:07.261
The body gets lonely in here.

03:07.428 --> 03:10.347
Yeah. It's not even sex,
you know? I just...

03:11.139 --> 03:12.683
I miss contact.

03:13.601 --> 03:16.103
Human beings aren't supposed
to live like this.

03:18.063 --> 03:19.398
I've been in almost two years

03:19.481 --> 03:21.609
and there's still nights
I reach out for my wife.

03:21.734 --> 03:24.236
You know, I was
thinking about you guys.

03:25.112 --> 03:27.615
And I was imagining
what I would do if Larry

03:27.740 --> 03:30.242
told me that he
wanted to be a woman.

03:30.325 --> 03:33.370
I'd like to think that
I would be open to it,

03:33.454 --> 03:35.163
but it would just be so weird.

03:36.123 --> 03:37.792
I'm sorry,
is that totally rude?

03:37.875 --> 03:39.585
No. It's fine.

03:40.628 --> 03:42.588
He would make
such an ugly girl.

03:42.671 --> 03:45.006
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

03:45.132 --> 03:46.372
Is he coming to
visit you today?

03:47.635 --> 03:49.678
First holiday in
prison can be rough.

03:50.304 --> 03:51.472
Very emotional.

03:51.597 --> 03:53.223
SOPHIA: But she's
gonna be fine,

03:53.307 --> 03:56.477
'cause we about to make some Heidi Klum
shit happen right here. (CHUCKLES)

03:57.937 --> 03:58.938
(SNIFFS)

03:59.563 --> 04:01.565
Ugh, that smells nasty.

04:03.191 --> 04:04.401
What's it made of?

04:06.236 --> 04:07.696
You don't wanna know.

04:08.823 --> 04:09.824
(GROANS)

04:10.658 --> 04:12.117
How did you learn all this?

04:12.868 --> 04:16.831
My aunt was a santera. I used
to help her out sometimes.

04:18.039 --> 04:19.166
I dabble.

04:21.709 --> 04:23.420
So what's gonna happen to me?

04:24.505 --> 04:28.175
You're gonna cramp up,
some wicked diarrhea.

04:30.344 --> 04:32.304
This shit ain't pretty.

04:32.429 --> 04:36.642
You drink this, then you're gonna
go out and dig a hole in the yard.

04:37.184 --> 04:38.727
You're gonna make
me shit in a hole?

04:38.853 --> 04:41.062
No. You're gonna put
this bean in there.

04:41.856 --> 04:43.691
Then you're gonna
find a cigarette,

04:43.816 --> 04:45.943
you're gonna blow
some smoke in there,

04:46.026 --> 04:48.529
you're gonna cover it up
with a mound of dirt.

04:49.613 --> 04:51.573
And that's gonna have to do it,

04:52.240 --> 04:59.122
because I don't have any
angelica or gris-gris oil.

05:02.334 --> 05:05.796
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

05:06.630 --> 05:07.882
Take it.

05:13.303 --> 05:14.471
This is gonna kill it?

05:14.555 --> 05:16.139
Well, that's what
you want, right?

05:16.223 --> 05:17.766
As long as it
don't feel anything.

05:17.892 --> 05:21.061
Please. It don't
even have a brain yet.

05:25.733 --> 05:27.401
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

05:28.318 --> 05:30.069
Hurry up, drink it.

05:32.406 --> 05:33.406
DAYANARA: Ow, that's hot!

05:33.448 --> 05:36.117
GLORIA: I told you it was, stupid.
Go ahead, drink it all.

05:38.119 --> 05:39.120
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

05:39.830 --> 05:41.540
Where my Snickers?

05:54.428 --> 05:59.307
You know, I pray for all the dead
babies and all their baby souls.

06:02.686 --> 06:05.773
(SOBS) And God, he's gonna
let them into heaven,

06:05.856 --> 06:08.107
even though
they weren't baptized.

06:09.068 --> 06:10.861
Are you getting all of this?
Yeah.

06:10.945 --> 06:14.656
And you can also tell Judy
that I pray for her as well.

06:14.782 --> 06:16.408
Well, her name's Barbara.

06:16.491 --> 06:18.201
Barbara?
Barbara.

06:18.285 --> 06:20.203
Damn! I can't keep all
this fan mail straight.

06:20.287 --> 06:22.163
(STUTTERS) I can't
keep up with it.

06:22.831 --> 06:24.123
What? You have fans?

06:24.249 --> 06:25.709
She's a hero.
(ALEX SCOFFS)

06:26.334 --> 06:28.087
She's a defender of the unborn.

06:28.253 --> 06:30.422
Jeez, that sounds
like a bad X-Men movie.

06:30.547 --> 06:32.758
What'd you do,
bomb an abortion clinic?

06:33.634 --> 06:39.848
And you can sign off with, "I
will be out of here by 2015,

06:40.808 --> 06:42.810
"before the rapture."

06:42.893 --> 06:43.978
(CHUCKLING) Oh, man.

06:44.103 --> 06:45.437
Is something
fucking funny to you?

06:45.520 --> 06:47.940
Yeah. It's just that people
predict the rapture all the time.

06:48.023 --> 06:50.358
I mean, wasn't that supposed
to happen in 2011?

06:50.484 --> 06:54.488
No. (STUTTERS) It comes in two stages.
If you study your shit.

06:55.656 --> 06:58.659
The first one was
a spiritual rapture.

06:59.618 --> 07:02.746
And the second one coming
is a physical one.

07:02.830 --> 07:04.790
Ah, I see.

07:04.873 --> 07:05.874
Okay?
Got it.

07:06.000 --> 07:07.001
And you're not invited,

07:07.126 --> 07:10.504
because they don't allow gay
people on the rapture bus!

07:10.587 --> 07:12.297
There's a bus?

07:12.756 --> 07:15.342
Are all the seats already taken
by Appalachian meth-heads?

07:15.467 --> 07:17.678
Oh, man, you're gonna... You're just
gonna get it, Vause, aren't you?

07:17.761 --> 07:19.471
Do we have to go
back to the dryer?

07:19.554 --> 07:21.274
You already locked me
in that fucking dryer.

07:21.348 --> 07:23.108
Yeah, maybe I'll fucking
turn it on this time.

07:23.183 --> 07:24.852
Make you spin
around like a gerbil.

07:24.935 --> 07:26.687
Wanna know why?

07:26.937 --> 07:33.610
'Cause I've had it with
rich bitches like you.

07:39.449 --> 07:40.701
JESSICA: Those are bobos!

07:41.284 --> 07:44.121
Real Adidas have
three stripes, not four.

07:44.204 --> 07:45.539
Your shoes are bobos.

07:45.664 --> 07:46.874
So?

07:46.999 --> 07:50.836
So your mom shops at Payless.
And works at Friendly's.

07:50.919 --> 07:52.546
(GIRLS LAUGH)

07:52.671 --> 07:54.798
My mom has, like, four jobs.

07:55.049 --> 07:57.217
That's not something
to brag about.

07:57.342 --> 07:59.053
You dress like a bum.

07:59.178 --> 08:01.138
She smells like one, too.

that janky car? (CHUCKLES)

08:07.144 --> 08:08.729

Bye-bye, pigsty!

DIANE: Are those your friends?

08:12.107 --> 08:13.400
No.

08:13.567 --> 08:14.902
How was school?

08:16.111 --> 08:19.614
They changed the schedule around, so
I don't gotta work nights no more.

08:19.740 --> 08:22.534
Fucking Brenda keeps trying to
get me to cover her shifts.

08:22.617 --> 08:25.245
What are you doing?
It's freezing out.

08:27.122 --> 08:28.582
DIANE: What the fuck was that?

08:28.707 --> 08:32.335
I'm not wearing those anymore.
They're bobos.

08:35.089 --> 08:36.423
Go get 'em back.

08:36.506 --> 08:38.008
Jessica Wedge
says they're lame.

08:38.092 --> 08:39.842
So fuck Jessica Wedge.

08:40.010 --> 08:43.097
They all make fun of me.
They call me pigsty.

08:45.473 --> 08:46.934
Did you tell them
who your dad is?

08:47.059 --> 08:48.435
I've never even met him.

08:48.602 --> 08:49.978
Well, you tell them.

08:50.104 --> 08:53.273
You tell them, "My dad is Lee Burley,
the drummer for Death Maiden."

08:53.398 --> 08:55.984
You see what those smug
little bitches say then.

08:56.110 --> 08:57.150
I mean, who are they, huh?

08:57.236 --> 08:59.077
What? 'Cause their parents
work at the college,

08:59.113 --> 09:00.614
they think they're
all fucking fancy?

09:00.697 --> 09:02.783
You are the daughter
of a rock god.

09:03.491 --> 09:06.661
If he's so rich and famous,
why are we so broke?

09:07.662 --> 09:10.290
You know how many girls used
to scream at his concerts?

09:10.373 --> 09:14.461
You know, rip their clothes off?
Throw themselves at him?

09:14.544 --> 09:18.840
But your dad chose me.
And together we made you.

09:20.675 --> 09:22.552
Now go get your
fucking sneakers.

09:22.636 --> 09:25.973
Don't you listen to those
smarty-pants assholes.

09:26.056 --> 09:27.456
They're gonna have
boring-ass lives.

09:27.515 --> 09:31.186
They're gonna wish that they were you.
You are cool.

09:35.107 --> 09:36.483
PORNSTACHE:
Listen up, turd-bags!

09:38.777 --> 09:40.779
We're gonna let you have your
little going-away party,

09:40.862 --> 09:44.699
but do not make our lives more difficult
afterwards by hanging yourself,

09:44.825 --> 09:47.661
with a sheet,
or a tampon string,

09:47.744 --> 09:50.247
or whatever the fuck you like to
get all arts and craftsy with.

09:50.330 --> 09:53.000
No Thanksgiving suicides.

09:53.125 --> 09:56.461
Chapman, what are we not to do
on this day of thanks?

09:56.544 --> 09:57.963
Commit suicide?

09:58.046 --> 09:59.047
Exactly.

We are the Pilgrims,
you bitches are the Indians.

where we cooperate.

BIG BOO: Oh, yes.

10:06.471 --> 10:10.433
We bring you maize, and you
give us small pox blankets.

10:10.558 --> 10:12.853
Exactly. Everybody wins.

10:16.731 --> 10:18.108
You look like JonBenet Ramsey.

10:18.192 --> 10:20.735
(CHUCKLES SARCASTICALLY) Well,
that's what I was going for.

10:21.361 --> 10:22.487
Can you hold this for me?

10:22.612 --> 10:23.738
Yeah.

10:26.867 --> 10:28.035
Did you make this?

10:29.036 --> 10:30.037
Mmm-hmm.

10:30.453 --> 10:32.706
It's my second attempt. I spelled
it wrong the first time.

10:34.041 --> 10:35.042
(ALEX CHUCKLES)

10:35.292 --> 10:36.960
And they say you
went to college.

10:37.044 --> 10:38.045
(CHUCKLES)

10:38.712 --> 10:42.716
God, I hate seeing people go. It
reminds me how much time I have left.

10:42.841 --> 10:43.884
PIPER: Yeah.

10:43.967 --> 10:45.635
But think of
the story that you'll have.

10:46.720 --> 10:47.762
That is my line.

10:47.929 --> 10:50.640
I know it is. You always trot
it out in times of suckiness.

10:50.849 --> 10:51.892
Yeah.

10:52.392 --> 10:55.436
Like that stomach
virus I had in Java.

10:55.562 --> 10:57.314
Oh, it was
a great fucking story.

10:57.397 --> 10:59.157
The whole village came out
to watch you poop.

kind of like that.

in the other one's hoo-ha.

12:32.826 --> 12:33.994
It was so nasty.

It's an abomination.

Piper loves Thanksgiving.

25:32.688 --> 25:34.190

Yeah, I don't know why.

You've been to Thanksgiving
with my parents.

25:39.862 --> 25:43.241
Yeah, no, I know, it's horrible.
She loves our Thanksgivings.

Oh, in your parents' apartment?

25:46.119 --> 25:49.622
They go to South Beach.
They have gravy boats.

25:49.705 --> 25:51.665
A maid comes and cleans up
in the morning. Come on.

25:51.707 --> 25:56.087
They won't mind me using these awesome
tchotchkes for my table-scape, will they?

25:56.170 --> 25:57.630
We have to cancel.

25:59.840 --> 26:02.300
We have to cancel. You have
to cancel the whole thing.

Cal, (STAMMERS) I can't
host people here, all right?

26:06.304 --> 26:10.143
Not under these circumstances. All right?
It does not feel right.

26:10.601 --> 26:14.105
No, yeah, you're right, man.
We should cancel.

26:15.397 --> 26:19.485
We'll cancel. We'll cover
the mirrors, sit shivah.

26:19.568 --> 26:22.655
It's what your
people do, right?

26:22.780 --> 26:24.991
It's when someone dies, Cal.
She's not dead.

26:25.116 --> 26:29.369
Exactly. Look,
I love my sister, dude.

26:29.495 --> 26:31.914
But she got herself
sent to the hoosegow.

26:31.998 --> 26:35.501
And now she's clearly pulled some other
shit to get herself into even more trouble.

26:35.584 --> 26:38.587
You have done everything
that you can do.

26:38.671 --> 26:42.340
And Piper would love the fact that
you're throwing Thanksgiving,

26:42.424 --> 26:46.679

the maid is coming tomorrow.

26:46.762 --> 26:52.518
And I've spent my entire life-savings
on this, this marvelous turkey.

26:53.560 --> 26:55.313

I'm in a cement box

My what?

27:26.052 --> 27:27.720
I was dancing.

Provocatively. Sexually.

This is illegal.
You can't keep me in here.

you're wrong.

where you come from.

I thought we could be friends.

You're not yourself lately.
You're acting out.

27:49.407 --> 27:50.910
So you're teaching me a lesson?

I'd be your girlfriend?

Is that it?

Did I make you jealous?

38:46.940 --> 38:48.650
Yeah, Maury Kind.

38:48.734 --> 38:51.319
I'm sorry, you're not a stray.
You're Maury Kind from NPR!

38:51.403 --> 38:53.321
Guilty.
Oh, my God, I love you.

38:53.405 --> 38:56.825
I love your show. I mean, I love...
(STUTTERS) I love you.

38:56.909 --> 38:58.189
(CHUCKLES) Thank you.
POLLY: Wow.

38:58.243 --> 38:59.244
Back off, Larry.
LARRY: Sorry, sorry.

38:59.369 --> 39:01.849
Where should we put our stuff? Put
it in the kitchen, follow me.

39:01.914 --> 39:03.415
You come meet my girlfriend!

39:03.540 --> 39:06.960
Don't get in her way, Cal!
She's got an angry, red vagina

39:07.085 --> 39:09.421
and she's been drinking rum
punch since 10:00 a.m.

39:09.546 --> 39:10.923
Thank God we pumped.

39:11.423 --> 39:13.842
I cannot believe you
brought Maury Kind.

39:13.926 --> 39:16.428
Yeah, I'm mixing
sound on Urban Tales.

39:16.511 --> 39:18.764
He's going through a divorce,
so I invited him.

39:18.847 --> 39:20.724
I didn't know
you'd geek out so hard.

39:20.849 --> 39:22.726
You know,
I'd love to talk to him.

39:23.518 --> 39:24.937
Well, it'd be weird
if you didn't.

39:25.020 --> 39:27.731
Besides, he read your "Modern
Love" column and loved it.

39:27.814 --> 39:29.691
Stop it. Seriously?
Uh-huh.

39:30.525 --> 39:31.526
Holy shit.

39:31.610 --> 39:32.694
PETE: Hey!

39:32.778 --> 39:33.862
Your language.

39:33.987 --> 39:35.113
Huh? Sorry.

39:35.196 --> 39:36.197
Shh.

39:36.281 --> 39:37.407
PIPER: What an asshole.

39:38.366 --> 39:43.329
I cannot believe people like him
are even allowed to work here.

39:43.622 --> 39:47.793
They take these insecure,
and frustrated men

39:47.918 --> 39:50.128
and they put them in charge
of a bunch of powerless women

39:50.211 --> 39:53.715
and they become
these predatory creeps.

39:53.799 --> 39:59.096
I mean, all of that condescending "I
know what's best for you" bullshit.

39:59.721 --> 40:02.390
VOICE: You can rage,
but they always win.

40:03.809 --> 40:05.102
They're the ones with the keys.

40:06.812 --> 40:08.730
How long have
you been down here?

40:09.731 --> 40:12.317
I've lost track.
I don't know.

40:12.985 --> 40:14.402
Nine months?

40:14.861 --> 40:16.237
A year?

40:18.490 --> 40:19.866
A year?

40:22.953 --> 40:24.329
That's insane.

40:24.412 --> 40:28.708
VOICE: They keep the lights on,
so you lose all sense of time.

40:28.834 --> 40:29.960
It's not living.

40:30.043 --> 40:31.795
I mean, yeah, you're breathing,

40:31.878 --> 40:33.713
but you ain't a person no more.

40:33.839 --> 40:38.301
It's bad. You start to
see shit that ain't there.

40:39.552 --> 40:40.804
You start to hear voices.

40:40.887 --> 40:42.639
Oh, my God.

40:43.348 --> 40:45.558
They keep you here
till they break you.

40:45.851 --> 40:46.852
(GULPS)

40:46.935 --> 40:48.561
I feel like I'm gonna throw up.

40:51.690 --> 40:53.358
Why did I do that?

40:55.193 --> 40:56.903
Why did I say those things?

40:59.489 --> 41:02.200
He's never going to
let me out of here.

41:04.036 --> 41:07.164
I am so fucking stupid.

41:07.914 --> 41:11.877
I am so fucking stupid!

41:12.335 --> 41:14.129
What's wrong with me?

41:14.212 --> 41:15.547
(SOBBING)

41:17.007 --> 41:18.591
VOICE: You still there?

41:25.807 --> 41:30.562
I swear to God that if
they let me out of here...

41:37.610 --> 41:39.196
I will shut up.

41:39.696 --> 41:44.910
I will shut up and I will put my
head down and I will do my time

41:44.993 --> 41:50.165
and I'll smile at Healy and I
(CRYING) won't go near her.

41:50.415 --> 41:52.542
I won't even look at her.

41:52.625 --> 41:56.421
I can do that.
I can do that. I can.

41:57.714 --> 41:59.091
Please.

42:01.634 --> 42:03.762
Please don't leave me here.

42:05.889 --> 42:07.099
Please.

42:08.349 --> 42:11.477
Hey, Vause, I know you're not
working, but can I get my bag?

42:11.603 --> 42:12.771
Yeah, just give me a sec.

42:12.896 --> 42:14.773
What happened to your glasses?

42:14.898 --> 42:16.978
(MIMICKING PENNSATUCKY)
Smashed in the name of Jesus.

42:17.025 --> 42:19.111
Oh, shit. Pennsatucky?

42:19.277 --> 42:22.114
Wow, you guys have
released the kraken.

42:22.280 --> 42:25.075
She's decided it's her Christian
duty to annihilate me.

42:25.158 --> 42:27.452
Because I'm a "privileged
rich girl." (SCOFFS)

42:27.911 --> 42:31.873
Which is hilarious, because those types of
girls tortured me my whole fucking life.

42:32.958 --> 42:35.085
If you and I had
met in fifth grade,

42:35.210 --> 42:37.336
you'd have made
fun of my clothes.

42:37.629 --> 42:39.172
(LAUGHS)
Who, me?

42:39.297 --> 42:41.216
No, no, no, no. I would never.

42:41.258 --> 42:43.551
You look terrific.
(SIGHS) Fuck!

42:43.635 --> 42:44.803
(NICKY CHUCKLES)

42:46.679 --> 42:48.056
I know what you were like.

42:48.140 --> 42:53.770
Upper West Side, doorman building,
skiing in Jackson Hole.

42:54.146 --> 42:55.188
Am I wrong?

42:55.313 --> 42:57.149
Who told you that shit?
No one.

42:58.399 --> 43:01.027
My business was built on
sniffing out girls like you

43:01.153 --> 43:02.862
and turning 'em into
drug mules.

43:02.988 --> 43:05.657
I knew it. You're a pimp.

43:05.824 --> 43:07.826
Man, you would've been perfect.

43:08.493 --> 43:11.788
Little Nicky at 19? Mmm! I would've
turned you out in two seconds.

43:11.871 --> 43:14.249
I'd make a terrible mule. I
would've done all your drugs.

43:14.332 --> 43:15.333
(ALEX CHUCKLES)

43:15.416 --> 43:18.503
Besides, okay, what makes you think
I would've fallen for your shit?

43:19.545 --> 43:22.215
Well, you grew up rich, so
you're used to easy money.

43:22.299 --> 43:25.177
You have enough stamps in your
passport to avoid suspicion.

43:25.260 --> 43:27.512
You hate your parents.
Yeah, totally.

43:27.595 --> 43:29.472
You're in your
experimental phase.

43:29.555 --> 43:31.390
All you wanna do is fuck
a woman or black guy,

43:31.516 --> 43:33.392
have some adventure...
Hmm. (CHUCKLES)

43:33.518 --> 43:35.353
...and still be able
to afford a Birkin bag.

43:35.561 --> 43:37.189
Shit, I'm in!
(CHUCKLES)

43:37.272 --> 43:38.356
Fuck it. You know me.

43:38.523 --> 43:40.108
Sign me up.

43:40.775 --> 43:42.194
Oh, was that who Piper was?

43:43.569 --> 43:45.530
No, no, Piper was different.

43:45.697 --> 43:46.865
Why? 'Cause you loved her?

43:49.159 --> 43:50.660
Because she was different.

43:53.830 --> 43:55.040
Get some glue, pimp.

43:57.458 --> 43:59.711
(SIGHS) Fuck.

44:03.464 --> 44:06.301
Crystal is in love
with her pastor.

44:06.384 --> 44:08.220
Ah. (CLICKS TONGUE)

44:08.345 --> 44:10.055
I'm not surprised.

44:10.889 --> 44:14.517
A lot of women lust after their
pastors, it's very common.

44:14.600 --> 44:18.938
And pastors can do that. Priests
have to learn to bounce their eyes.

44:19.397 --> 44:20.899
Um, what's that?

44:21.024 --> 44:25.195
You never stay focused on a member
of the opposite sex for too long.

44:25.570 --> 44:27.906
That's how I watch
every Russell Crowe movie.

44:27.989 --> 44:28.990
(CHUCKLES)

44:32.077 --> 44:33.411
She wants my blessing.

44:34.620 --> 44:35.830
Then you should give it to her.

44:35.955 --> 44:37.207
Why?

44:39.458 --> 44:41.378
I don't understand
why she needs to have sex.

44:41.460 --> 44:43.420
I mean, (CHUCKLES) look at you.

44:44.172 --> 44:45.882
I'm a nun, I took a vow.

44:45.965 --> 44:47.633
She married a man
with a penis, I assume

44:47.759 --> 44:49.426
because she wanted to
use it occasionally.

44:50.469 --> 44:53.723
(SIGHS) How much
time do you have left?

44:54.266 --> 44:56.851
(SIGHS) Three years,
eight months.

44:57.518 --> 45:00.230
You got what you needed at a
pretty big cost to your family.

45:00.313 --> 45:02.274
This is what she needs.

45:02.941 --> 45:05.442
Doesn't Crystal
deserve some happiness?

45:06.111 --> 45:07.862
Let her go.

45:08.780 --> 45:09.989
I can't.

45:10.115 --> 45:12.200
It's the right thing to do.

45:25.046 --> 45:26.756
I'm a hyperbaric welder.

45:26.839 --> 45:30.676
Yeah, I used to work on the pipelines,
but now I just normal weld.

fabricating some sculptures.

Cal and I are naming them.

Oh, oh! Speaking of scars, how was it?
The whole birth thing?

45:43.815 --> 45:44.855
Did you eat your placenta?

45:44.899 --> 45:46.651
No. We passed on that.

45:46.776 --> 45:49.570
CAL: Oh, it's really good
for you. Crazy nutrients.

45:49.654 --> 45:53.741
People dehydrate it and make it into
pills, but that's the expensive way.

45:53.825 --> 45:56.202
I always just thought you
could, like, scramble it up.

45:56.328 --> 45:59.872
(CHUCKLES) Just, like, put it in a pan
with some salt and pepper. (POPS)

45:59.998 --> 46:03.418

but possibly delicious.

I don't.

Pete, you're
dropping food on his head.

46:11.801 --> 46:16.014
So, yeah, you know, we both decided
to stick it out, you know.

46:16.097 --> 46:21.019
I mean, it hasn't been easy, but, you
know, relationships are not easy.

Right. Yeah.

for it to come off that way.

I'm sorry, what was that?

Sorry. No, I didn't know if you ever were
open to maybe doing a prison episode.

47:13.738 --> 47:16.408
You know, if you ever
had guests like me on.

47:17.283 --> 47:19.536
Yeah. The thing is, if we
wanted to document prison,

47:19.618 --> 47:22.372
we'd probably talk
to actual inmates.

47:22.455 --> 47:26.418
And if we were gonna do a story about
someone whose loved one was in prison,

we'd find a more
representative example.

49:49.686 --> 49:53.231
Straight girls. (SCOFFS) They'll
fuck you up every time.

Hey!

Hey. (KNOCKS)

50:47.285 --> 50:49.454
Did you get this loaf thing?
(KNOCKS)

50:51.289 --> 50:54.959
Looks like three different dinners
mushed together into a mound.

50:55.668 --> 50:57.002
Are you looking at it?

51:00.465 --> 51:01.633
Hello?

51:02.799 --> 51:04.009
Can you hear me?

51:11.142 --> 51:13.185
Please tell me that
you're still there.

51:17.273 --> 51:18.316
CAPUTO: You can't
leave her in there.

51:18.399 --> 51:20.485
I don't know what the hell she's
doing in Seg in the first place.

51:20.610 --> 51:24.280
Christ, even Mendez
said it was uncalled for

51:24.363 --> 51:26.324
and that guy lives
to throw people in the box.

51:26.407 --> 51:28.200
You're not my boss.
Today I am.

51:28.326 --> 51:29.661
Fig is on vacation.

51:29.744 --> 51:35.750
And I am telling you I don't have the
write-ups or the paperwork to support it.

51:35.832 --> 51:38.919
She got under your skin, Sam.
This is personal.

51:39.044 --> 51:41.547
She thinks she's
running the place.

51:41.798 --> 51:44.008
You don't have to tell me that.

51:44.509 --> 51:48.179
Her fiance is raising a stink bigger
than the shit I took this morning.

51:48.304 --> 51:50.807
Christ, he's probably got the
Obamas on the phone by now.

51:50.889 --> 51:53.810
These liberal, wealthy
offenders, they're connected.

51:54.602 --> 51:58.855
And if they review this, the paper
trail is going to be sweaty.

52:00.525 --> 52:03.569
So do us all a favor
and get her out of there.

52:03.736 --> 52:05.738
It's not even 48 hours.

52:05.862 --> 52:07.281
Get her out of there.

I'm sorry you feeling like shit,
chica, but I had to do it.

52:31.681 --> 52:33.224
It's okay.
I'm relieved, actually.

52:42.233 --> 52:43.442
(WHISPERING) I wanna keep it.

(SPEAKING SPANISH)

52:45.695 --> 52:47.455
But I don't wanna
get him in trouble, though.

52:50.241 --> 52:52.577
Don't worry, nena.
We'll figure something out.

52:52.660 --> 52:55.912
You're gonna have a baby.
I'm gonna be a grandmother.

getting in the car.

53:29.447 --> 53:31.198
I'll just take a minute.

53:31.282 --> 53:32.909
I was wrong.

You do whatever you need to do.

You have my blessing.

53:59.059 --> 54:00.853
My cousin, Neicey,
told me I could stay here.

54:00.977 --> 54:03.856
Neicey don't live here no more.
And I know she ain't your cousin.

54:03.980 --> 54:05.566
We had the same foster family.

54:06.191 --> 54:10.321
Look, I ain't getting my ass in trouble
letting some ex-con stay in my house.

54:10.446 --> 54:13.157
But I have to stay here. This is
the address I gave my supervisor.

54:13.324 --> 54:15.367

come check on me.

54:15.576 --> 54:17.161
That ain't my problem.

54:17.369 --> 54:19.204
I ain't got
nowhere else to stay at.

54:20.372 --> 54:21.415
Shit.

54:23.041 --> 54:24.877
You can sleep in that corner.

Leave that
mattress where it is.

you're back to your old dosage.

that's against the rules,

why she was in SHU.
