Mistress: <i>
Previously on "The Outpost"...</i>

00:03.916 --> 00:06.049
- What does your kinj do?
- Unites our people

00:06.049 --> 00:08.399
and takes us all
to paradise.

00:08.399 --> 00:10.401
Janzo: Maybe it connects all of
the stingfly brains together.

00:10.401 --> 00:12.055
- Like a hive.
- [ both grunting ]

00:16.581 --> 00:18.322
- Red kinj! Ah!
- [ gasping ]

00:18.322 --> 00:20.716
I can'’t control it.
I am dangerous.

00:20.716 --> 00:22.457
She'’s a good person.
You can trust her.

00:22.457 --> 00:24.633
Take it.
It belongs in you.

00:24.633 --> 00:27.592
I believe I misjudged you.
Release the Baroness.
She'’s free to go.

00:27.592 --> 00:29.725
...do hereby release you
from our marriage vows.

00:29.725 --> 00:31.466
You are now free
to marry Rosmund.

00:31.466 --> 00:32.989
Talon: There'’s a black kinj.

00:32.989 --> 00:34.817
Maybe the only weapon
that'’ll kill Yavalla.

00:34.817 --> 00:36.601
- And where is it?
- There'’s someone
in the Plane of Ashes

00:36.601 --> 00:38.081
- who might know where it is.
- Who?

00:38.081 --> 00:40.170
- My father.
- Come back alive.

00:40.170 --> 00:41.041
I always do.

01:47.672 --> 01:50.197
[ yelling ]

01:50.197 --> 01:52.155
[ grunting ]

01:52.155 --> 01:54.636
Cut his throat and it'’ll be
the last thing you ever do.

01:54.636 --> 01:57.117
[ laughing ]

01:57.117 --> 01:59.728
Corven? Get off me!
What are you doing?

01:59.728 --> 02:01.817
Corven, stop it.

02:01.817 --> 02:05.777
Wren? This is
fantastically unexpected.

02:05.777 --> 02:10.086
- Get off me, Corven!
- Don'’t you move or I'll damn
well cut your head off.

02:10.086 --> 02:12.088
- Corven, it'’s me, Zed.
- I know who you are!

02:12.088 --> 02:14.395
You'’re an agent of evil.
You should die.

02:14.395 --> 02:16.919
- Let him go.
- My brother is evil'’s agent.

02:16.919 --> 02:19.313
Its enforcer.
A pawn of the oppressor.

02:19.313 --> 02:22.707
No, Corven. Zed has come here
with me with only the best
of intentions.

02:22.707 --> 02:25.667
Corven, you trust me,
don'’t you?

02:25.667 --> 02:29.801
My Wren.
My dear, dear Wren.
Of course I trust you.

02:29.801 --> 02:31.281
And what? You don'’t trust
your own brother?

02:31.281 --> 02:33.196
- [ Corven growls ]
- Back off!

02:35.764 --> 02:38.027
Good. Good, good.
Now let him go.

02:38.027 --> 02:41.291
Corven, for me.

02:41.291 --> 02:42.466
Only for you, Wren.

02:47.297 --> 02:48.820
You came back for me, Wren.

02:50.126 --> 02:51.083
We all did.

02:54.130 --> 02:55.827
Not Zed.

02:55.827 --> 02:57.525
He left me here to die.

02:57.525 --> 02:59.744
Wait a minute, Cor,
you wanted to stay.

02:59.744 --> 03:01.181
You were proud to be
at Yavalla'’s side.

03:01.181 --> 03:02.791
Quiet!

03:02.791 --> 03:05.750
I don'’t want to hear
your sounds.

03:05.750 --> 03:09.711
Your voice,
your heart beating,

03:09.711 --> 03:12.279
I want it all silent.

Janzo, let me in!

Janzo!

04:09.031 --> 04:12.121
- Janzo, please!
- Munt.

04:14.689 --> 04:17.344
Who'’s there? Franco?

04:17.344 --> 04:19.259
It'’s me.

04:22.262 --> 04:25.134
Janzo, thank the gods.

04:25.134 --> 04:28.485
- They won'’t let me in.
- Munt, you can'’t come in.

04:28.485 --> 04:30.270
You'’re infected.

04:30.270 --> 04:33.098
If I let you in,
you'’ll infect us all.

04:33.098 --> 04:37.407
Oh, but, Janzo, you--
you won'’t leave me to die
out here, will you?

04:37.407 --> 04:39.583
Munt, you'’re not going to die.

04:39.583 --> 04:41.542
You-- you run along

04:41.542 --> 04:43.544
and you go and hide
in the forest until
it'’s all over, all right?

04:48.331 --> 04:52.857
Janzo, Mum told you
to look after me.

04:52.857 --> 04:55.077
I'’m your little brother.

04:55.077 --> 04:57.645
You have to help me.

04:57.645 --> 05:00.474
You know we cannot
let him in, Janzo.

05:04.652 --> 05:08.003
Send your men to go
and block the smugglers'’ route
through the dam wall.

05:08.003 --> 05:09.787
We don'’t want him
to get in that way.

05:09.787 --> 05:13.487
Right.
I'’m sorry, Janzo.

05:13.487 --> 05:15.663
Now, Munt,
you get away from here,
all right?

05:15.663 --> 05:17.229
If you try to come in,
they'’re going to kill you.

05:17.229 --> 05:20.929
- Go on! Go!
- No, Janzo!

05:28.284 --> 05:29.807
Shall we prepare to attack?

05:32.897 --> 05:36.640
My child,

06:27.865 --> 06:30.390
So, Commander Spears,
what'’s the verdict?

06:30.390 --> 06:33.349
We'’re ready, Your Majesty.
We will defeat her.

06:33.349 --> 06:37.397
- You seem confident.
- Yavalla'’s minions are
mindless automatons.

06:37.397 --> 06:40.138
Only a few are even
trained soldiers.
The rest are peasants.

06:40.138 --> 06:42.793
- So you think
we have a chance?
- A good chance.

06:42.793 --> 06:45.100
We have plenty of food
and soldiers, thanks to
Tobin and Falista.

06:45.100 --> 06:46.406

06:49.060 --> 06:50.845
- Reload.
- I'’m sorry.

06:50.845 --> 06:53.282
I-- I know it came at
a personal cost to you, Gwynn.

06:53.282 --> 06:55.415
Well, given the circumstances,

06:55.415 --> 06:57.286
how we rebuild
doesn'’t much matter now.

06:57.286 --> 07:00.332
Your men and I
can hold this Outpost.
Don'’t you worry.

07:00.332 --> 07:03.118
It makes me happy
to see you like this, Garret.

07:03.118 --> 07:06.382
I'’ve missed your swagger.

07:06.382 --> 07:07.470
It'’s good
to feel useful again.

07:08.863 --> 07:12.083
- Your Majesty.
- Yes. Come on.

07:24.052 --> 07:26.837
Ahem. Lord Tobin?

07:26.837 --> 07:29.449
I'’m sorry to intrude, Rosmund,
but I do need to speak with you.

07:29.449 --> 07:31.233
Uh, maybe in the morning
in the throne room,

07:31.233 --> 07:33.583
- not here in my quarters.
- No. What I have to say,

07:33.583 --> 07:35.498
I need to say now.

07:35.498 --> 07:36.847
Warlita, can you give us
a minute?

07:42.505 --> 07:46.466
[ door opens, closes ]

07:46.466 --> 07:48.642
Ever since Falista
acquired her kinj

07:48.642 --> 07:53.821
and since you
so gracefully released her,

07:53.821 --> 07:55.300
circumstances have changed.

07:56.824 --> 08:00.654
So much so that...

08:00.654 --> 08:02.612
Falista offered to release me
from our marriage.

08:05.615 --> 08:08.183
The army is yours,
devoted to Your Majesty,
the Queen,

08:08.183 --> 08:09.532
regardless of what
I choose to do.

08:11.708 --> 08:13.144
What do you mean
what you choose to do?

08:15.407 --> 08:16.539
It'’s my choice now.

08:16.539 --> 08:19.281
I'’m a free man,

08:19.281 --> 08:22.284

from this anymore.

08:22.284 --> 08:26.070
I, uh--

08:26.070 --> 08:28.899
I messed things up
all around, didn'’t I, Rosmund?

08:28.899 --> 08:30.510
I hurt you.

08:32.990 --> 08:35.427
I hurt her.

08:35.427 --> 08:38.518
And I-- I hurt myself.

08:41.695 --> 08:43.261
But now I'’m ready
to make things right.

08:43.261 --> 08:47.570
Because of you,
I am a better man, Rosmund.

08:47.570 --> 08:50.660
Because of you,
I see things more honorably,

08:50.660 --> 08:53.010
which is why I'’ve made
the choice to...

08:58.146 --> 08:59.190
...to stay with Falista.

09:09.200 --> 09:10.680
Uh, I see.

09:12.552 --> 09:14.292
When you--
when you locked her away

09:14.292 --> 09:18.166
and when there was a chance
that she may have to die,

09:18.166 --> 09:22.736
all my old feelings for her
flooded forward.

09:22.736 --> 09:24.520
I must have suppressed them
out of loyalty to you,

09:24.520 --> 09:26.783
but I have loved her since
I was eight years old, Rosmund.

09:26.783 --> 09:28.785
I belong with her.

09:32.572 --> 09:34.269
I thought you should
hear it from me.

09:37.402 --> 09:40.405
I appreciate that,
Lord Tobin.

09:40.405 --> 09:44.366
Rosmund, I will--
I will always love you...

09:44.366 --> 09:45.715
as my queen.

09:49.719 --> 09:52.504
My army is yours,
my land is yours,
my food is yours.

09:52.504 --> 09:57.205
And I am your loyal servant
forever, Queen Rosmund.

09:57.205 --> 10:01.122
Lord Tobin, I am grateful
for your loyalty.

10:01.122 --> 10:02.558
Uh...

10:06.780 --> 10:09.957
I-- I can'’t do this.

10:09.957 --> 10:12.916
This hurts.

10:12.916 --> 10:14.439
I love you, Lord Tobin.

- I'’d like to be alone now.

10:26.582 --> 10:29.716
Thank you, Rosmund.

10:29.716 --> 10:33.371
For what it'’s worth,
I misjudged Falista.
She is a good woman.

10:38.202 --> 10:41.684
Yes. Yes, she is.

10:41.684 --> 10:44.034
And if I may,

10:44.034 --> 10:45.645
Garret is a good man.

10:58.353 --> 11:01.399
- [ groaning ]
- What happened to him, Wren?

11:01.399 --> 11:02.792
He was sickened
during Mother'’s mission
to steal the meld box.

11:02.792 --> 11:04.402
So why didn'’t you get him
to a healer?

11:04.402 --> 11:06.709
I was the closest thing to
a healer in the Plane, remember?

11:06.709 --> 11:08.493
I did everything I could
to help him.

11:08.493 --> 11:10.191
He was much worse
than this before.

11:10.191 --> 11:12.410
Look, I'’m sorry about
whatever happened to Corven.

11:12.410 --> 11:14.586
But will he lead us to the cave
where Yavalla killed my father?

11:14.586 --> 11:16.197
Talon,
can you just wait a second?

11:16.197 --> 11:17.372
Your father is not more
important than my brother.

11:17.372 --> 11:19.156
I never said he was, Zed.

11:19.156 --> 11:20.723
It'’s not about either of them.

11:20.723 --> 11:23.726
We need to find
the black kinj.

11:23.726 --> 11:25.075
It might be our only hope
to kill Yavalla.

11:27.687 --> 11:29.297
You'’re right. I'm sorry.

11:29.297 --> 11:30.951
I'’ll try to talk
to him again.

11:30.951 --> 11:31.778
Maybe he'’s calmed down.

11:36.217 --> 11:38.785
Corven! Corven?

11:43.528 --> 11:46.793
I know seeing your brother
like that is rough, Zed.

11:46.793 --> 11:48.229
I'’m just worried
about everyone else.

11:53.625 --> 11:56.237
Corven,
time is of the essence.

11:56.237 --> 11:58.718
We need your help. Now.

12:01.111 --> 12:03.026
You need my help?

12:03.026 --> 12:06.116
How could I possibly help you
in my condition?

12:06.116 --> 12:07.814
My circumstances?

12:07.814 --> 12:10.904
My predicament, hmm?

12:10.904 --> 12:12.906
We have a map, right?

12:12.906 --> 12:16.518
A map that you made.

12:16.518 --> 12:17.911
Where did you get this?

12:17.911 --> 12:21.741
Death. This is death.

12:21.741 --> 12:24.831
Why is it death?
What does that mean exactly?

12:26.920 --> 12:28.138
Who is this human
who keeps speaking?

12:28.138 --> 12:30.314
She'’s not a human,
she'’s a Blackblood.

12:30.314 --> 12:33.100
- Another agent of Yavalla!
- No.

12:33.100 --> 12:34.971
Quite the opposite, actually.

12:34.971 --> 12:37.060
Yavalla has proven to be
everything you accused her of,

12:37.060 --> 12:38.975
and now we must stop her.

12:38.975 --> 12:42.109
And to stop her,
we need you to show us
to these caves.

12:42.109 --> 12:44.589
[ chuckles ]

12:44.589 --> 12:48.071
Nothing but death
in that hole.

12:48.071 --> 12:50.421
Corven, I need you
to do this for me.

12:50.421 --> 12:52.772
I know that I have no right
to ask you to return
to that place,

12:52.772 --> 12:54.599
but there is no other way.

12:54.599 --> 12:58.603
- Please.
- Wren, dear Wren,

12:58.603 --> 13:00.910
if I show you where it is,

13:00.910 --> 13:02.738
you can'’t go down in there.

13:02.738 --> 13:04.131
You can'’t.

13:06.089 --> 13:07.787
Zed can go down.

13:07.787 --> 13:09.832
Let Zed go down.

13:09.832 --> 13:12.182
Fine. Fine, Corven.

13:12.182 --> 13:14.184
You and I can go in
together,

13:14.184 --> 13:16.099
fighting side by side
just like we used to.

13:16.099 --> 13:19.799
- You and me?
- Yeah.

13:22.062 --> 13:25.717
Why should I help you?
You didn'’t help me!

13:25.717 --> 13:28.808
Corven, you know I would
do anything for you.

13:28.808 --> 13:31.767
- We were just following orders.
- Shut up!

13:31.767 --> 13:34.683
Death down there.
That'’s all.

13:34.683 --> 13:37.729
That'’s where death lives.

13:37.729 --> 13:41.385
Promise me Zed goes down.
Maybe the girl.

13:41.385 --> 13:44.867
But you have to swear to me
you won'’t go in the hole,
dear Wren.

13:44.867 --> 13:46.390
That'’s the only way
I'’ll show you where it is.

13:46.390 --> 13:49.567
All right, all right.
I won'’t go down.

13:51.569 --> 13:52.440
Just show us.

14:02.363 --> 14:03.277
Come on.

stabled in the east quarter.

in the cellars.

14:33.742 --> 14:38.268
Sorry. I got a little
carried away there.

14:38.268 --> 14:41.315
Is there, uh, anything
that I can help with?

14:43.578 --> 14:46.059
Not unless
you can change the past.

14:46.059 --> 14:47.887
Maybe there'’s a kinj
for that.

14:47.887 --> 14:48.888
Don'’t even joke.

14:52.282 --> 14:54.545
- Tobin?
- Am I that obvious?

14:54.545 --> 14:56.069
How long have
we known each other?

14:56.069 --> 15:00.290
A lifetime.
And so did they.

15:00.290 --> 15:02.553
Yeah? Tobin and Falista?

15:02.553 --> 15:05.426
Mm. Yeah,
they were childhood friends

15:05.426 --> 15:07.297
and then they were lovers,
like you and I.

15:07.297 --> 15:11.388
- So he told us.
- And how can I--

15:11.388 --> 15:13.521
how can I fault a man
for holding a love in his heart

15:13.521 --> 15:15.566
he'’s had since he was a child?

15:15.566 --> 15:17.742
I can'’t deny him that
when I'’ve had the same
feelings for you.

15:20.354 --> 15:23.574
Garret,
this is not some attempt
to seduce you.

15:23.574 --> 15:26.186
I mean, Talon'’s my best friend.
She means the world to me.

15:28.579 --> 15:31.931
Thank you for always
being there for me.

15:31.931 --> 15:33.976
And I always will be.

15:36.109 --> 15:37.675
I hope she makes it home
safely.

15:39.286 --> 15:40.678
So do I.

15:48.121 --> 15:49.992
She cut her ears,
didn'’t she?

15:49.992 --> 15:53.517
- Yes, she did.
- It'’s unnatural.
It'’s deceitful.

15:53.517 --> 15:56.042
Talon was the last survivor of
our people in the green world.

15:56.042 --> 15:57.347
She did it to hide
among humans.

15:57.347 --> 15:58.653
I don'’t trust her.

15:58.653 --> 16:00.002
I don'’t trust
my brother, either.

16:00.002 --> 16:01.482
Zed always takes away
anyone I love.

16:01.482 --> 16:04.833
- What are you talking about?
- Mother?

16:04.833 --> 16:08.054
Father?
You killed them both.

16:08.054 --> 16:09.751
They died in battle, Corven,
you know that.

16:09.751 --> 16:12.797
You were in the same battle.
Why didn'’t you die?

16:12.797 --> 16:14.669
I don'’t know. Luck, I guess.

16:14.669 --> 16:18.151
No! It'’s because
you killed them!

16:18.151 --> 16:19.979
- Corven!
- Corven!

16:19.979 --> 16:21.806
- [ Corven grunting ]
- Talon, let him go.

16:21.806 --> 16:24.157
He'’s not helping,
and he'’s almost killed
Zed twice.

16:24.157 --> 16:26.159
- It'’s not his fault!
- Then who'’s fault is it?

16:26.159 --> 16:29.379
It'’s mine!
It is my fault!

16:29.379 --> 16:30.206
What do you mean
it'’s your fault?

16:33.035 --> 16:36.038
- You did this to him?
- Zed, I wasn'’t there

16:36.038 --> 16:37.692
when my mother took the box
from Saivek Redwan.

16:37.692 --> 16:42.044
I was there when she returned
with only two men left.

16:42.044 --> 16:43.872
A third arrived later,
and it was Corven,

16:43.872 --> 16:45.395
but he was more dead
than alive.

16:45.395 --> 16:49.051
- And? What happened?
- Apart from his hand,

16:49.051 --> 16:52.228
he had no other wounds,
so I figured he'’d been
poisoned somehow.

16:52.228 --> 16:54.187
But I didn'’t know what had
poisoned him, so I couldn'’t
give him an antidote.

16:54.187 --> 16:56.841
- So it was the poison
that did this to him?
- No, no.

16:56.841 --> 16:59.714
His brain was perfectly intact,
but the poison was killing him.

16:59.714 --> 17:02.325
And he was in a lot of pain.
It was awful.

17:02.325 --> 17:04.849
Mother told me
just to end his misery,
and I couldn'’t do that,

17:04.849 --> 17:08.244
so I had to think of something,
and I knew that fireworms
were immune to all poisons.

17:08.244 --> 17:10.116
I always hypothesized that maybe
it was something to do

17:10.116 --> 17:11.073
with the chemicals or a property
or something in their--

17:11.073 --> 17:12.770
- Wren!
- Right.

17:12.770 --> 17:16.209
So, I gave Corven an infusion
of fireworm blood

17:16.209 --> 17:19.255
in the faint hope that it might
neutralize the poison.

17:19.255 --> 17:21.910
I didn'’t know what else
it would do.

17:21.910 --> 17:23.607
And I mean, it worked, right?
It saved his life.

17:23.607 --> 17:26.915
But he also couldn'’t
control himself.

17:26.915 --> 17:30.701
He started attacking people,
just about everyone but me.

17:30.701 --> 17:33.487
He was particularly hell-bent
on killing my mother.

17:33.487 --> 17:35.619
Yavalla left me there.

17:35.619 --> 17:38.231
I got her the box,

17:38.231 --> 17:39.667
and she just left me
there to die.

17:44.280 --> 17:46.891
Zed, I'’m sorry.

17:46.891 --> 17:50.417
It was an untested idea.
I had no right to do it.

17:50.417 --> 17:54.943
But I had to think of something,
otherwise he would have died.

17:54.943 --> 17:58.338
- Oh, you must hate me.
- How could I hate you?

17:58.338 --> 18:00.731
Corven doesn'’t hate you.

18:00.731 --> 18:03.647
All I see is gratitude.

18:03.647 --> 18:06.433
You saved his life.

18:06.433 --> 18:09.131
You weren'’t there, Zed.

18:09.131 --> 18:11.090
You left me behind.

18:11.090 --> 18:13.483
Just like Yavalla!

18:13.483 --> 18:17.270
She sent you here to kill me,
but I'’m already dead.

18:17.270 --> 18:21.012
I'’m not here to kill you,
Corven!

18:21.012 --> 18:24.015
You'’re my brother!
I love you.

18:24.015 --> 18:27.628
Yavalla betrayed all of us,
and we can'’t stop her
without your help.

18:31.849 --> 18:32.720
I'’ll show you the way.

19:29.559 --> 19:30.691
Yavalla:
The time has come.

19:34.129 --> 19:37.828
Go now.
The way is open to you.

19:37.828 --> 19:40.091
Bring the Outpost
into my fold.

20:29.271 --> 20:30.751
No.
[ sniffles ]

20:30.751 --> 20:33.406
No. I don'’t want you
to see me like this.

20:43.198 --> 20:48.290
- I spoke to the Queen.
- When'’s the wedding?

20:48.290 --> 20:50.510
You'’ll excuse me
if I don'’t come.

20:50.510 --> 20:53.861
Well...

20:53.861 --> 20:56.342
it already happened.

20:56.342 --> 20:59.867
What? You should have made
a grand affair of it, Tobin,

20:59.867 --> 21:01.216
to show everyone.

21:01.216 --> 21:03.305
I was talking about
our wedding.

21:03.305 --> 21:05.916
Mine and yours.

21:05.916 --> 21:07.091
But I released you
from your vows.

21:07.091 --> 21:08.267
I don'’t want to be released.

21:11.226 --> 21:12.271
I'’m confused.

21:13.924 --> 21:18.320
Falista, I love you

21:18.320 --> 21:20.757
and I want to be
married to you

21:20.757 --> 21:22.542
if you'’ll have me.

21:26.197 --> 21:28.548
What about this thing
in my head?

21:28.548 --> 21:32.552
The kinj, I can'’t control it.
What if I hurt you?

21:32.552 --> 21:34.597
We'’ll figure it out together.

22:04.714 --> 22:05.541
Corven:
We'’re here.

22:07.978 --> 22:10.938
- Go, Zed.
- What'’s down there, Corven?

22:10.938 --> 22:11.982
[ chuckles ]

22:13.723 --> 22:14.550
Tell us what happened to you.

22:16.987 --> 22:20.426
No! Nothing but death in there!

22:20.426 --> 22:24.386
- Go!
- Corven, listen to me.

22:24.386 --> 22:26.127
We need you
to show us the way.

22:26.127 --> 22:29.086
No! I'’m staying out here.

22:29.086 --> 22:31.175
With Wren. Don'’t worry!

22:31.175 --> 22:34.657
We'’ll wait until we're sure
you and your friend are dead!

22:36.137 --> 22:37.704
I'’m sorry, Corven.
I have to go with them.

22:37.704 --> 22:42.186
No! Deal was,
you don'’t go down in there.

22:42.186 --> 22:44.841
Only Zed and the ear-cutter.

22:44.841 --> 22:47.322
- I'’m sorry.
- You promised.

22:49.803 --> 22:52.936
Everyone lies to Corven.

22:52.936 --> 22:56.200
- You lied to Corven.
- Seemed like the only way
to get you to help us,

22:56.200 --> 22:58.899
- Corven, I'’m sorry.
- I'’m not going back in there.

22:58.899 --> 23:00.770
- I'’m not!
- It'’s all right.
It'’s all right.

23:00.770 --> 23:04.426
You don'’t have to.
We have the map
to lead us from here.

23:04.426 --> 23:07.081
Corven, wait here.
I will be back for you.

23:07.081 --> 23:12.347
- I promise.
- No! Death is down there!

23:13.522 --> 23:16.830
I'’m going with you.

23:16.830 --> 23:20.442
If you die, dear Wren...

23:20.442 --> 23:22.792
I die beside you.

23:30.496 --> 23:31.671
Come on.

23:42.246 --> 23:46.468
Down here,
it all comes to an end.

23:46.468 --> 23:47.513
Shh.

23:49.558 --> 23:50.951
You smell that?

23:54.171 --> 23:56.696
Corven, why do you keep saying
death is in here?

23:59.655 --> 24:01.004
Did Yavalla kill my father?

24:01.004 --> 24:03.093
No. I killed him.

24:03.093 --> 24:05.269
What? You killed him?

24:05.269 --> 24:07.533
No, I didn'’t.

24:07.533 --> 24:09.709
You killed him
or you didn'’t kill him?

24:09.709 --> 24:10.971
Yes.

24:18.979 --> 24:22.330
No blood.

24:22.330 --> 24:24.550
Death touched him
before he ever got to use it.

24:27.466 --> 24:30.556
Did Yavalla ever tell you
what happened to the warriors
that didn'’t make it back?

24:30.556 --> 24:33.559
Talon, all I know
is that Yavalla took eight
of our best warriors

24:33.559 --> 24:36.300
and Corven and two others
were the only ones
who made it back.

24:36.300 --> 24:41.001
Five, six, seven, eight.

24:41.001 --> 24:42.306
Talon:
Eight against one.

24:42.306 --> 24:45.484
Yavalla wasn'’t
taking any chances.

24:48.748 --> 24:50.489
Death doesn'’t die.

25:20.257 --> 25:21.215
Um...

25:30.224 --> 25:32.705
You know there'’s no way Yavalla
left your father alive, Talon.

25:32.705 --> 25:34.402
Maybe he got away.

25:34.402 --> 25:35.621
Why didn'’t he go after her?

25:37.405 --> 25:38.798
Look, I don'’t know.

25:38.798 --> 25:41.409
But something killed
Yavalla'’s men

25:41.409 --> 25:43.672
and Corven keeps saying
"death doesn'’t die."

25:45.587 --> 25:48.329
Yeah, well,
in case you haven'’t noticed,
Corven'’s crazy.

25:48.329 --> 25:51.637
The black kinj.

25:51.637 --> 25:53.856
It'’s death.
That'’s what Two said.

25:53.856 --> 25:56.555
Which is saying it would be
a miracle if your father
was still alive,

25:56.555 --> 25:59.296
- so don'’t get your hopes up.
- Hopes.

26:01.777 --> 26:03.257
I don'’t know whether to hope
he'’s alive or dead.

26:04.824 --> 26:06.129
Hated him my whole life.

26:09.219 --> 26:10.917
But I want answers.

26:10.917 --> 26:14.355
I mean, why would he abandon
his family to live in a cave?

26:17.401 --> 26:21.275
Just don'’t want you to feel
the same disappointment
I'’m feeling.

26:21.275 --> 26:24.060

the wrong turn two tunnels ago.

32:41.394 --> 32:42.612
Are any of them my father?

32:42.612 --> 32:46.703
Get out!
We shouldn'’t be here!

32:50.533 --> 32:53.710
I'’m sorry, Talon.
Doesn'’t look like there's
anything alive in here.

32:58.454 --> 32:59.978
Look for any clues
about the black kinj.

32:59.978 --> 33:03.416
That'’s what we came here for.

33:12.381 --> 33:15.123
- Here'’s something.
- No!

33:19.127 --> 33:22.000
- Don'’t touch that!
- Why? What'’s inside
the box, Corven?

33:22.000 --> 33:23.088
Only pain.

33:23.088 --> 33:25.177
And burning.

33:25.177 --> 33:28.267
And suffering.

33:28.267 --> 33:30.356
Madness.

33:30.356 --> 33:32.923
Yavalla took the only
valuable thing in that box.

33:32.923 --> 33:36.275
- Do not touch it.
- All right.

33:36.275 --> 33:39.321
Nothing in here.
Nothing!

35:03.275 --> 35:04.145
Hello there.

35:09.411 --> 35:11.196
It'’s me. It's Tobin.

35:11.196 --> 35:12.632
- Are you all right?
- You came for me.

35:12.632 --> 35:14.764
Of course I did.
Come here.

35:14.764 --> 35:17.550
- Are you hurt?
- No. Oh, I was so scared.

35:17.550 --> 35:18.855
My kinj fought one of them off,

35:18.855 --> 35:20.205
but I couldn'’t
make it work again,

35:20.205 --> 35:22.032
and they were coming
from everywhere,

35:22.032 --> 35:23.338
- and it hurt so much.
- Falista, it'’s all right.

35:23.338 --> 35:24.948
It'’s all right, Falista.
They'’re dead now.

35:24.948 --> 35:27.821
But we need to find our way
back to the keep.

35:27.821 --> 35:30.650
- Stay close to me, understand?
- Mm-hmm.

35:30.650 --> 35:32.913
- Okay, let'’s go.
- Wait.

35:40.268 --> 35:42.488
All right, let'’s go.

35:58.678 --> 36:01.159

36:03.639 --> 36:05.902
- [ crowd shouting ]
- The way through to
the barracks is closed.

36:05.902 --> 36:07.165
We'’ll have to figure
something else out.

36:09.515 --> 36:11.821
- Gods above,
how do we get through here?
- There'’s no way!

36:11.821 --> 36:13.258
We could sure use that kinj
right about now.

36:13.258 --> 36:15.477
Wish I could figure it out.

36:15.477 --> 36:17.479
All right, if we get over
to that balcony,

36:17.479 --> 36:19.742
we can shimmy across
that ledge

36:19.742 --> 36:21.962
- over the barricade.
- Okay.

36:21.962 --> 36:24.747
Come on.

36:24.747 --> 36:26.488
- I'’ve done this before.
- [ gasps ]

36:36.150 --> 36:38.457
Go over the railing,
stay close to the wall.

36:38.457 --> 36:39.893
- I'’m coming right
behind you, okay? Go.
- Okay.

36:39.893 --> 36:41.634
- Go!
- [ whimpering ]

36:41.634 --> 36:44.550
[ crowd shouting ]

36:57.563 --> 36:58.868
Tobin!

37:01.697 --> 37:02.611
- Go!
- Tobin!

Tobin!

[ grunting ]

37:28.507 --> 37:29.334
We need to go.

[ arrows thudding ]

38:12.986 --> 38:14.204
Falista: No.

38:16.250 --> 38:18.426
- No! No, Tobin!
- [ grunting ]

38:18.426 --> 38:21.995
- Hey.
- [ grunting ]

38:21.995 --> 38:23.649
[ Falista sobbing ]

38:31.047 --> 38:33.267
- [ groaning ]
- No, he'’s hurt.

38:33.267 --> 38:35.356
Put him down. Put him down.
That'’s far enough.

38:35.356 --> 38:38.228
Careful. Be careful.
Janzo, we need you!

38:38.228 --> 38:42.058
You'’re safe now, Tobin, okay?
Just hold on a little longer.

38:42.058 --> 38:45.453
Help'’s coming. Stay with me.
Stay with me.

38:45.453 --> 38:47.760
- There. Stay with me.
- [ groaning ]

38:47.760 --> 38:50.415
- Garret: Janzo!
- Tobin.

38:50.415 --> 38:52.808
Tobin?

38:52.808 --> 38:54.854
[ whimpering ]

38:54.854 --> 38:57.117
- Give me some room.
Give me some room.
- Tobin?

38:58.771 --> 38:59.946
Tobin?

39:02.165 --> 39:04.646
[ groaning ]

39:04.646 --> 39:06.431
Come on, Tobin. Come on!

39:06.431 --> 39:08.476
Falista,
he'’s lost a lot of blood.

39:08.476 --> 39:11.087
- [ sobbing ]
- His body'’s getting cold.

39:11.087 --> 39:13.307
No!

39:13.307 --> 39:16.745
- I'’m sorry. It's too late.
- No! No! Do something!

39:16.745 --> 39:19.661
Janzo, you have to help him.

39:19.661 --> 39:21.968
Don'’t you think
I would if I could?

39:23.665 --> 39:24.492
[ Tobin coughs ]

39:38.593 --> 39:39.725
I'’m sorry, Gwynn.

39:42.510 --> 39:44.860
Falista: No.

39:51.301 --> 39:54.000
Don'’t go, my love.

39:58.308 --> 40:01.399
[ sputtering ]
The-- the queen.

40:01.399 --> 40:04.140
Use your power
to protect the queen.

40:05.664 --> 40:07.448
[ gasping ]

40:10.233 --> 40:13.411
No.

40:15.543 --> 40:17.110
No, Tobin!

[ sobbing ]

40:19.895 --> 40:20.766
No!

Tobin, no.

<i>[ music playing ]</i>

40:45.878 --> 40:48.010
Gods, look at that
poor bastard.

40:54.060 --> 40:55.888
Took four men to do that.

40:57.716 --> 40:58.586
Talon.

41:00.501 --> 41:02.460
I think that'’s your father.

41:13.862 --> 41:14.689
That'’s him.

41:17.475 --> 41:19.607
Oh, I'’m so sorry, Talon.

41:21.609 --> 41:23.393
Gods, he'’s barely
even decayed.

41:27.572 --> 41:30.270
Why would Yavalla
do this to him?

41:30.270 --> 41:32.751
Let'’s just remove the spears.
At least we can give him
a proper burial.

41:43.326 --> 41:45.546
Don'’t touch me!

41:46.721 --> 41:47.592
I'’ll kill you.

41:49.724 --> 41:51.987
I told you!

41:51.987 --> 41:53.119
It'’s death.
