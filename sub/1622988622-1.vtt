00:08.633 --> 00:13.972
Loki, once again, for crimes
against Asgard, you are banished to Earth.

00:14.055 --> 00:18.685
Ah. Where to? New York? London? Paris?

00:18.768 --> 00:20.103
Springfield.

00:20.186 --> 00:23.523
No!

00:23.606 --> 00:26.568
[screaming]

00:28.278 --> 00:30.280
Ow! [groans]

00:30.363 --> 00:32.657
Whoa. Hey, man. Can I help you?

00:32.741 --> 00:36.953
What would you know
of a distant, abusive father?

00:37.037 --> 00:41.708
And a blonde-haired sibling
who's always perfect?

00:41.791 --> 00:44.127
Oh, have I got the family for you.

00:44.210 --> 00:46.463
So, the boy says you're magic.

00:46.546 --> 00:48.673
Can you turn one pork chop into two?

00:50.759 --> 00:52.927
I worship you, great Loki.

00:53.011 --> 00:55.930
Command me, O Lord.
I renounce all other gods.

00:56.014 --> 00:59.476
The last thing this world needs
is more pork chops.

00:59.559 --> 01:00.560
Get her!

01:00.643 --> 01:02.395
[growls]

01:02.479 --> 01:04.564
No, Bart! I'm your sis--

01:06.066 --> 01:07.484
[wolf snoring]

01:09.486 --> 01:15.700
[reading]

01:17.285 --> 01:20.455
Well, there's no way I'm worthy.
I'll just put it back.

01:21.289 --> 01:23.875
[grunting]

01:24.876 --> 01:25.877
Whoa!

01:25.960 --> 01:29.631
Goodbye, self-esteem issues!

01:29.714 --> 01:30.757
Ha!

01:30.840 --> 01:32.550
Lisa is Thor?

01:32.634 --> 01:34.427
It's not all it's cracked up to be.

01:34.511 --> 01:38.640
And I brought the Springfield Avengers
with me.

01:40.058 --> 01:41.059
[burps]

01:44.813 --> 01:47.524
I ruined my pants in a brand-new way.

01:47.607 --> 01:48.900
All right, they're no help.

01:48.983 --> 01:51.653
But you're through here, Loki!

01:51.736 --> 01:54.239
[Bart's voice] No, no! You're making
a big mistake. Homer, help me!

01:54.322 --> 01:55.281
[grunts]

01:55.365 --> 01:56.950
No! Homer, I'm really--

01:57.033 --> 01:58.910
Ay, caramba!

02:00.704 --> 02:02.706
[cheering, whistling]

02:03.623 --> 02:04.916
[Loki's voice, laughs]

02:05.000 --> 02:06.751
[Homer humming]

02:09.212 --> 02:12.090
-Whoa!
-We love you so much, boy.

02:13.425 --> 02:14.426
Yes, Father.

02:14.509 --> 02:18.763
Oh, and tomorrow could you turn Flanders
into a pork chop? I'll do the rest.

02:18.847 --> 02:19.848
Yes, Father.

02:21.349 --> 02:23.643
Finally, a functional family.

02:39.159 --> 02:43.496
Gee, Moe, I can't believe
you gave us drinks on the house tonight.

02:43.580 --> 02:45.623
That's because I ain't Moe.

02:46.624 --> 02:47.917
I'm Loki.

02:48.001 --> 02:50.503
And these beers will ruin your lives,

02:50.587 --> 02:53.089
dissolve your livers,
fill you with remorse.

02:53.173 --> 02:55.759
And though they say
these bottles are recyclable,

02:55.842 --> 02:58.470
they just fill up the ocean!

02:59.095 --> 03:01.222
Your planet is dying!

03:02.515 --> 03:03.558
Still worth it.

03:25.080 --> 03:26.456
You're not nice!

03:26.539 --> 03:27.874
[grunts]

03:27.957 --> 03:32.212
-[Loki groaning]
-[Ralph grunting]

03:32.295 --> 03:33.296
[chuckles]

03:33.922 --> 03:34.923
Privacy please.

03:35.924 --> 03:37.550
-[chattering]
-Shh!

03:52.524 --> 03:53.525
[Loki grunts]

03:53.608 --> 03:57.112
Loki, I could give my verdict
in two words or less,

03:57.195 --> 03:59.072
but as you would put it,

03:59.155 --> 04:01.783
you stand here accused
of tampering with the sacred timeline,

04:01.866 --> 04:04.285
philosophically opposing predeterminism,

04:04.369 --> 04:07.038
crossing over into forbidden areas
of Disney+,

04:07.122 --> 04:09.457
taking two spots in the Goofy parking lot,

04:09.541 --> 04:11.668
being more popular than all the heroes,

04:11.751 --> 04:15.005
having a British accent when you're
actually supposed to be from Norway,

04:15.088 --> 04:19.092
promising to be good, then breaking
your promise like a zillion times,

04:19.175 --> 04:21.469
making us sit through
numerous mid-credits scenes,

04:21.553 --> 04:22.971
hoping they advance the story!

04:23.054 --> 04:26.808
And will you please wash your nasty hair?

04:26.891 --> 04:28.393
Guilty as charged!

04:28.476 --> 04:30.186
Get out of my face.
