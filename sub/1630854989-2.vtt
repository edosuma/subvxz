WEBVTT

00:00.160 --> 00:03.040
The following program contains
strong language,

00:03.040 --> 00:05.000
and violent scenes.

00:15.000 --> 00:17.040
I'd remember if I'd seen
you in here before.

00:17.040 --> 00:18.040
I'm Cindy. Like the doll.

00:18.800 --> 00:21.880
There was a time when the
name Lord counted for something.

00:21.880 --> 00:24.640
Russo, take that left, yeah?
You and your old man are done.

00:25.760 --> 00:28.160
Come here! Your one of the Lord
boys, aren't you?

00:28.160 --> 00:29.520
Not so dangerous after all.

00:31.640 --> 00:33.200
Get in!

00:33.200 --> 00:36.040
You get yourself to Spain!
Uncle Tone will look after yer.

00:36.040 --> 00:37.280
I don't wanna go to Spain!

00:40.240 --> 00:42.000
I need to speak to Eddie Smith.

00:42.000 --> 00:44.560
You ever heard of extradition?
Well, there is none here.

00:44.560 --> 00:46.880
Means you can't get arrested
by British police.

00:48.360 --> 00:50.680
Better make it count girl.

00:50.680 --> 00:53.160
Remember that fella from
the club, Ernesto?

00:53.160 --> 00:55.240
We were gonna do a deal until
he went cold on me.

00:55.240 --> 00:57.400
Fuck you!

00:57.400 --> 00:59.280
Tony, no, fuck!

00:59.280 --> 01:00.320
Tony, don't.

01:10.920 --> 01:12.800
Ernesto shot Tony.

01:15.080 --> 01:16.280
I love you.

01:17.960 --> 01:20.040
Of course you fucking do.

02:00.440 --> 02:02.080
Hola muchacha.

02:08.360 --> 02:09.960
Fuck.

02:52.680 --> 02:54.360
Oh.

03:22.720 --> 03:24.120
Gene!?

03:26.240 --> 03:27.760
What have we done Cind?

03:36.600 --> 03:39.680
All we were supposed to do was lie
low and keep our heads down.

03:41.640 --> 03:44.760
What was he thinking? Walking into
Escobell's with a fucking gun.

03:46.840 --> 03:48.280
Always the showman.

03:51.520 --> 03:54.760
Cind, I saw my uncle on the floor,
with his canister blown off!

03:56.400 --> 03:58.160
He's gone, and now we've
got nothing.

03:58.960 --> 04:00.520
We've got each other.

04:03.600 --> 04:06.960
Listen. All you tried to do
was broker a deal.

04:06.960 --> 04:10.040
You don't get it, do you? We can't
wind the clocks back.

04:11.600 --> 04:14.840
We're on our toes, my uncle's dead,
and we've got nowhere left to run.

04:14.840 --> 04:17.040
And for what? For this
stupid piece of paper.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
Wasn't your fault.

04:22.880 --> 04:24.920
Yeah. Yeah you're right
it wasn't my fault.

04:27.160 --> 04:29.360
That's why we're gonna come
clean Cind, yeah?!

04:31.360 --> 04:34.000
Tell the police everything.
We've got nothing to hide.

04:34.640 --> 04:37.760
Gene, the last thing we should
do is talk to the police.

04:40.200 --> 04:41.880
Look.

04:46.080 --> 04:49.840
All we gotta do, is lay low.

04:49.840 --> 04:50.880
Right?

04:53.080 --> 04:55.480
Then we can plan
our next move.

05:00.360 --> 05:04.000
Gene, Gene. Look at me.
Fucking look at me!

05:05.880 --> 05:09.000
Our whole lives depend on how you
act in the next five minutes,

05:09.000 --> 05:11.480
alright? Don't say a word.

05:44.520 --> 05:47.280
I am so sorry, to be
the one to tell you.

05:53.360 --> 05:57.080
Did your uncle ever mention the
name Ernesto Alvarez to you?

05:58.400 --> 06:00.520
No, why?

06:00.520 --> 06:05.800
They met around the time he was
killed - did he not tell you?

06:05.800 --> 06:08.120
Tony was a very private man.

06:13.440 --> 06:17.240
And where were you yesterday,
at around sunset?

06:17.240 --> 06:18.640
At work.

06:20.040 --> 06:21.360
No, I wasn't talking to you.

06:22.880 --> 06:24.240
Gene?

06:25.720 --> 06:27.760
We were at work together.

06:27.760 --> 06:29.320
Yeah.

06:29.320 --> 06:33.600
Tony was planning on doing some
building and asked us over to help.

06:33.600 --> 06:35.440
Help how?

06:35.440 --> 06:38.680
We're in construction. He wanted us
to stress test his properties.

06:43.040 --> 06:45.840
And do you have someone to
corroborate this?

06:45.840 --> 06:48.280
We did. But he's dead.

06:50.400 --> 06:51.720
Convenient.

06:53.440 --> 06:55.640
If we had something to hide.

06:59.520 --> 07:02.760
Well this is part of a
murder inquiry so, if you do

07:02.760 --> 07:05.440
think of anything else, please
contact the station.

07:05.440 --> 07:08.040
All the details,
including mine, are here.

07:09.360 --> 07:12.720
And I would prefer it if you
didn't leave town just yet.

07:31.200 --> 07:34.120
Are you sure there's nothing else
you'd like to tell me before

07:34.120 --> 07:35.440
I leave?

07:39.360 --> 07:41.480
No. No.

07:46.200 --> 07:49.360
Very well.

07:55.040 --> 07:57.880
Cind, we're gonna sell this land
and get the hell out of here.

08:08.800 --> 08:10.600
♪ Livin' in a shack in a
one-horse town.

08:12.400 --> 08:16.120
♪ Trying to get to heaven ‘fore
the sun goin' down. ♪

08:50.720 --> 08:52.320
Gonna be alright Cind.

08:54.200 --> 08:57.160
Tony's land, including Ernesto's
field, could be worth fifty

08:57.160 --> 08:58.360
thousand pounds.

08:59.920 --> 09:01.800
That's our ticket out of here.

09:05.960 --> 09:07.720
You need to call your dad, Gene.

09:09.040 --> 09:11.480
He's gonna find out one
way, or another.

09:16.360 --> 09:18.680
Yeah, you know, he always
looked up to Uncle Tony.

09:21.120 --> 09:22.800
He'll be devastated.

09:24.880 --> 09:27.840
You'd better make space for me
in that bloody coffin.

09:29.960 --> 09:35.360
Yeah, he's a prick, but he's
still your dad.

09:35.360 --> 09:36.840
Be alright.

09:56.400 --> 09:58.640
Is someone gonna get that, or what?

10:01.320 --> 10:02.320
Why's it always me?

10:09.880 --> 10:11.880
Gene for you, Alb.

10:21.520 --> 10:23.400
He says it can't wait.

10:27.160 --> 10:28.520
Alb.

10:31.440 --> 10:33.840
What is it boy?

10:33.840 --> 10:35.360
It's Uncle Tony.

10:40.080 --> 10:41.800
He's dead.

10:55.840 --> 10:57.960
What did he say?

11:00.400 --> 11:02.360
The less they know about
Tony the better.

11:02.360 --> 11:05.360
Yeah, and hopefully the moment he's
buried, they'll fuck off.

11:19.360 --> 11:22.160

We've been stood out here ages.
It's fucking roasting.

11:33.040 --> 11:35.240
And these Bensons taste funny.

11:38.640 --> 11:40.600
Fucking hell.

11:41.720 --> 11:43.680
Always had style, our Tony.

11:44.800 --> 11:45.880
You alright?
Alright.

11:50.400 --> 11:53.600
Poor Uncle Tony. What a
fucking way to go eh?

11:53.600 --> 11:55.200
Yeah, tell me about it.
Where's Kelly?

11:55.200 --> 11:56.760
Plotted up. Arm's still fucked.

11:57.200 --> 11:59.640
Hiyah. Good to see you.
Yeah you too.

11:59.640 --> 12:03.280
Missed you. This car is amazing.

12:03.280 --> 12:07.720
Poor thing, having to
deal with all this.

12:07.720 --> 12:09.080
I missed you, Mum.

12:09.080 --> 12:12.200
Don't worry, I'm here now.

12:14.520 --> 12:16.040
Come on.

12:18.160 --> 12:21.520
Alright, shall we?
Maybe your father should drive?

12:21.520 --> 12:22.560
It's his car now.

12:51.480 --> 12:52.600
Fuck me, it's palatial.

12:54.320 --> 12:55.320
This'll do.

12:56.360 --> 12:58.360
He wasn't joking when he
said he was caked.

12:58.360 --> 13:01.320
Cind, whatever happens, don't
mention the land, or the deeds.

13:03.640 --> 13:04.640
We've rung the bell.

13:06.080 --> 13:09.520
Oh my God. Leonard look at this.

13:09.520 --> 13:11.040
Are you having a fucking laugh?

13:13.120 --> 13:16.920
This is ours now. All of it.

13:17.840 --> 13:19.720
This'll help put us back
in the game Alb.

13:21.040 --> 13:23.480
Mum. There's a fucking
swimming pool in the garden.

13:25.400 --> 13:27.440
Alright, we'll take the
top room now, yeah.

13:27.960 --> 13:29.320
Yeah. We want the one-
Shush!

13:31.240 --> 13:34.720
Your father needs space.
Do him a tea.

13:38.080 --> 13:39.080
I'll show yer.

13:40.480 --> 13:42.000
Dad, are you alright?

13:44.080 --> 13:46.720
We need to talk. Boy to man.

13:51.880 --> 13:53.440
Walk me through what happened.

13:56.160 --> 13:58.360
I've no idea what happened Dad,
I wasn't there.

13:59.720 --> 14:00.920
It's a police matter now.

14:01.160 --> 14:02.160
Police?

14:03.240 --> 14:06.600
We don't have it with gavvers.
What d'you tell ‘em?

14:08.360 --> 14:11.600
The truth.
The truth, so what's the truth?

14:17.960 --> 14:21.280
Don't you get tricky with me, Son
- it doesn't end well.

14:23.800 --> 14:26.920
Dad, we were plotted here all
afternoon. Alright.

14:36.520 --> 14:41.120
Gimme a memory.
Something I can hold onto.

14:50.760 --> 14:55.920
He loved to sing, Dad.
He had some voice.

14:58.200 --> 15:03.400
Police. Spandau Ballet, Video Killed-
- the Radio star.

15:04.800 --> 15:07.200
Yeah. Gonna miss him.

15:12.600 --> 15:15.240
Hold me, boy.

15:28.320 --> 15:31.920
Look lads, I found this hat in
his bedroom. Natty eh?

15:31.920 --> 15:35.560
Natty? Looks fucking
ridiculous. Take it off.

15:35.560 --> 15:37.680
What?
Take it off!

15:37.680 --> 15:39.520
Fucking hell. Alright.

15:47.280 --> 15:51.280
So, did he try it on with you?

15:51.280 --> 15:52.680
Who, Tony?

15:52.680 --> 15:54.440
Couldn't keep his cock in his pants.

15:54.800 --> 15:57.680
Tried to fuck me every time
Bert had his back turned.

15:57.680 --> 15:59.720
Hmm, lovely thought.

15:59.720 --> 16:01.760
I had my moments.

16:01.760 --> 16:02.920
Maybe I wasn't his type?

16:03.440 --> 16:05.360
Anything with a cunt was his type.

16:07.440 --> 16:10.160
I'm really glad you came out here,
Mint Ma. Gene needs you.

16:12.360 --> 16:15.760
None of this is his fault, you know.

16:15.760 --> 16:18.640
I only did it to save him
from getting nicked.

16:18.640 --> 16:20.440
You must think I'm some
kind of bitch.

16:21.600 --> 16:25.720
You, a bitch..? Nah.

16:27.600 --> 16:29.360
You're a survivor.

16:34.160 --> 16:37.200
Thanks, Mint Ma. Appreciate that.

16:37.200 --> 16:39.800
You can drop the Mint, now.

16:48.880 --> 16:51.440
I hear they're talking about you
back in London, Geno.

16:51.440 --> 16:54.160
About the scrapyard. Bods saying
you're the new Ronnie Biggs.

16:56.320 --> 16:57.440
You've come of age, kid.

16:58.000 --> 17:01.280
Well, this is nice - us together.

17:01.280 --> 17:03.360
Cheers darling.
What the fuck is that?

17:03.360 --> 17:05.200
Dirty banana.

17:05.200 --> 17:09.200
I say this with a heavy heart, as
our short time here fills me

17:09.200 --> 17:11.240
with sadness.

17:11.240 --> 17:16.560
Tony, you were a gentleman and
will be missed by us all.

17:19.440 --> 17:21.840
But where there's an ending,
there's a beginning.

17:26.040 --> 17:27.160
Here's to us. The Lords.

17:29.640 --> 17:31.280
The Lords

17:54.200 --> 17:55.920
Fucker.

18:10.560 --> 18:11.560
Hi.

18:11.560 --> 18:15.720
Cindy, hola. How are
you holding up?

18:15.720 --> 18:20.240
Oh, you know. The family are
here for the funeral and...

18:20.240 --> 18:22.160
we're sharing memories
and some tears.

18:25.080 --> 18:28.680
Well, I have news. Good news.

18:28.680 --> 18:31.000
We found Ernesto Alvarez near Escobells,

18:31.000 --> 18:33.320
with a bullet in his chest.

18:33.320 --> 18:35.120
Alive. He's recovering in hospital.

18:37.200 --> 18:39.320
Wow. That's, that's
wonderful. Did he talk?

18:41.160 --> 18:45.080
Oh, he will. And hopefully,
as our only clear witness,

18:45.080 --> 18:47.280
shed some light on what happened.

18:47.280 --> 18:49.400
Yeah.

18:49.400 --> 18:51.200
Anyhow. I thought you'd
like to know.

18:52.200 --> 18:53.960
Thanks.

18:53.960 --> 18:58.040
And you still have my card if, you
remember anything else that

18:58.040 --> 19:00.800
might help my investigation.

19:00.800 --> 19:02.520
Yeah, of course

19:03.640 --> 19:05.400
Buenos tardes.

19:21.120 --> 19:24.080
Whatever happens, we're in this
together alright. You and me.

19:24.080 --> 19:25.880
We need to act fast.

19:31.120 --> 19:32.480
I'll go to the hospital, I...

19:33.920 --> 19:35.040
I'll try and talk to him.

19:35.440 --> 19:36.480
And say what?

19:37.800 --> 19:40.760
Offer him a deal,
like... half the land.

19:40.760 --> 19:43.000
See if he keeps schtum.

19:43.000 --> 19:44.240
He'll never agree, Cind.

19:45.240 --> 19:47.360
What else we gonna do?

19:47.360 --> 19:50.360
Even if he tells the police we were
at Escobells, we haven't got

19:50.360 --> 19:52.160
blood on our hands.

19:52.160 --> 19:53.200
We're in the clear.

19:54.200 --> 19:56.880
You think he's gonna hold his
hands up to killing Tony..?

19:57.200 --> 20:00.000
He'll stick it on us.
Cind, you don't know that.

20:00.000 --> 20:01.520
You think he's a straight goer?

20:02.920 --> 20:05.200
He killed your Uncle for
fuck sake. He's a snake.

20:06.000 --> 20:08.040
You stole his deeds.
He'll come for us next.

20:11.000 --> 20:12.600
When he wakes up...

20:14.600 --> 20:16.040
If he grasses,

20:18.600 --> 20:19.720
that's us gone for life.

20:21.320 --> 20:22.800
End of.

20:32.920 --> 20:34.240
Let's do whatever it takes.

20:39.840 --> 20:41.120
Okay.

20:57.640 --> 21:00.240
Ernesto.

21:08.680 --> 21:11.480
Gene or Cindy Lord.

21:44.480 --> 21:46.760
This is your chance.

21:46.760 --> 21:48.560
I'll cover for you until
you get back.

21:52.520 --> 21:54.040
Excuse me.

22:00.160 --> 22:04.560
Hola, my name is Cesar Cabrol.

22:04.560 --> 22:08.320
I came to offer my condolences and
welcome you to our beautiful costa.

22:08.320 --> 22:11.480
Yeah whatever, fuck are you anyway?

22:11.480 --> 22:15.560
I have the honour of being the
mayor of this beloved coast.

22:15.560 --> 22:18.800
I understand this is a difficult

22:18.800 --> 22:21.720

our wonderful country.

22:25.600 --> 22:26.960
Handsome.

22:26.960 --> 22:28.200
Handsome. How?

22:28.200 --> 22:29.240
Senora, it's time.

22:36.160 --> 22:38.400
What did Pedro say?
Not a clue.

24:08.360 --> 24:10.360

24:12.120 --> 24:14.000
Make the police go away.

24:16.160 --> 24:20.280
No one needs to know.
We could make a deal.

24:20.280 --> 24:23.960
All get rich. Mucho dinero.

24:28.880 --> 24:31.680
Why should I deal,

24:33.680 --> 24:36.040
with a murderer?

24:36.040 --> 24:38.160

As well as to be expected.
Oh. I don't see Cindy.

26:11.240 --> 26:14.280
You haven't met my brother Leonard,
just flew down from London.

26:14.280 --> 26:15.360
Len. Len.

26:15.360 --> 26:18.240
This is Detective Alfonso - he's
leading the investigation

26:18.240 --> 26:19.520
into what happened to Uncle Tony.

26:19.520 --> 26:22.120
Someone blew his fucking head
off, is what happened.

26:22.120 --> 26:23.960
Anyway, we don't have it
with gavvers.

26:29.160 --> 26:30.160
Who's that cunt?

26:34.080 --> 26:35.720
He's taken it badly.

26:37.440 --> 26:40.760
So, er Cindy? She already left?

26:42.400 --> 26:46.440
Nah, still inside. She just wanted
some alone time with Tony.

26:47.800 --> 26:50.880
Ah. I see.

26:54.600 --> 26:56.360
Wait here.

27:24.800 --> 27:27.480
What did Ernesto say?
Did you find him?

27:35.120 --> 27:36.960
Cindy, what did you do?

27:40.400 --> 27:42.040
I had no choice, Gene.

27:43.480 --> 27:47.560
He was gonna pin it all on us.
Whatever it takes, remember?

27:49.080 --> 27:51.400
I'm the one who's gotta
live with this.

27:59.840 --> 28:01.880
Where's your earring?

28:05.360 --> 28:06.880
And you're bleeding.

28:08.720 --> 28:10.480
Oh fuck.

28:14.240 --> 28:16.200
Senor Lord.

28:17.320 --> 28:18.800
Please.

28:18.800 --> 28:20.240
Ah fuck's sake. What is it now?

28:23.400 --> 28:28.480
Would you like to say a few words
about your brother..?

28:28.480 --> 28:31.280
Yeah, come on then.

28:38.760 --> 28:47.280
I'm not really one for talking,
but well my brother is...

28:47.280 --> 28:50.160
was the sort of man who
wanted to be remembered.

28:51.720 --> 28:54.280
It's funny looking out, seeing
all of Tony's pals - all

28:57.000 --> 29:00.360
brilliant white smiles and plenty of
readies - it's all he ever wanted.

29:02.040 --> 29:05.800
And boy did he get it.
A real millionaire.

29:05.800 --> 29:10.120
He never wanted anyone to know that
we were born in the gutter,

29:10.120 --> 29:13.080
that we had to beg on the bombed out
streets during the war, just

29:13.080 --> 29:15.320
to get enough food to survive.

29:17.960 --> 29:21.160
He hated when I told people that we
never tasted Coca-Cola till

29:21.160 --> 29:22.320
we were teenagers.

29:22.320 --> 29:27.000
He used to say “Bert, if you wanna
get rich, act rich, and stop

29:27.000 --> 29:28.800
feeling sorry for yourself.”

29:32.080 --> 29:33.600
Me?

29:34.840 --> 29:37.240
I thought he was a
complete fucking wanker.

29:38.720 --> 29:41.440
I hate people who pretend they're
something they're not.

29:42.160 --> 29:48.720
Money turned Tony bad, not that he
was ever good, and look where

29:48.720 --> 29:52.360
he ended up, look where
his fortune got him.

29:55.440 --> 29:58.640
This place is a shit hole,
so you won't have to put up
with me for long.

29:59.600 --> 30:01.440
Buenas fucking dias.

30:04.840 --> 30:06.480
Come on.

30:06.480 --> 30:09.440
Nice one dad.
Cheers son. See you in the pub.

30:09.440 --> 30:11.040
Yeah.

30:12.520 --> 30:14.480
Come on, we should go. Fuck this.

30:24.840 --> 30:27.160
Sorry if I went a bit strong.

30:27.160 --> 30:29.040
Needed to be said, Alb.

30:32.440 --> 30:35.080
Fucking tea tastes funny.

30:35.080 --> 30:36.880
Spanish cows.

30:38.160 --> 30:41.360
I don't mind saying though, I find
the climate very agreeable here.

30:42.520 --> 30:43.520
Hey.

30:44.960 --> 30:46.880
I know where our home is, Ma.

30:49.400 --> 30:50.840
There.

30:52.480 --> 30:55.240
Perfect. Just like my husband.

30:59.640 --> 31:02.040
Let's sell up and fuck off
back to South London, eh?

31:07.160 --> 31:10.800
What d'you reckon on the desk?
Nah it's not worth nothing. Burn it.

31:10.800 --> 31:12.560
Well at least the house
is worth a fortune.

31:12.560 --> 31:15.200
Woah Dad, what you doing?
We son are selling up!

31:15.200 --> 31:16.320
You what?

31:16.320 --> 31:19.720
We're gonna get
out of this shit hole and back
to Bermo where we belong.

31:20.720 --> 31:22.760
Ah shit.
What d'you reckon on the Yucca, Ma?

31:22.760 --> 31:23.640
That's not a yucca.

31:23.840 --> 31:26.920
Well, whatever it is, it's gotta
be worth thirty innit?

31:26.920 --> 31:29.880
What about that end table?
We're not taking anything home Ma.

31:29.880 --> 31:31.200
Mum. Dad.
We're not taking anything.

31:31.200 --> 31:34.000
Just stop. Okay. There's
something I need to tell you.

31:35.840 --> 31:37.520
Well go on!

31:38.920 --> 31:43.000
None of this is his alright,
Tony died penniless.

31:43.000 --> 31:45.880
This house, the car, it's all.
it's all borrowed, or stolen.

31:47.680 --> 31:49.280
He lied to us.
What?

31:52.120 --> 31:56.040
He was potless. And he was singing in
Club Paradiso to make ends meet.

31:56.040 --> 31:58.600
Take a look.

31:58.600 --> 32:01.440
The real owners are a Swiss
family who live in Monaco.

32:07.760 --> 32:09.480
Mum.

32:24.040 --> 32:25.840
I'm sorry, Dad.

32:41.000 --> 32:42.640
Fuck's sake. Get us a beer, will ya?

32:43.080 --> 32:44.800
But I'm winning. Go get it yourself.

32:46.880 --> 32:49.000
What have I brought you
out here for then?

32:49.000 --> 32:50.280
A holiday?

32:50.280 --> 32:52.440
Carl.

32:52.440 --> 32:54.360
Oh fuck's sake!

32:58.400 --> 32:59.680
Alright babe?

33:00.800 --> 33:02.320
You alright bruv?

33:03.400 --> 33:04.480
Yeah I'm alright mate.

33:04.880 --> 33:07.480
Listen, there's something
I've gotta tell you bruv.

33:08.520 --> 33:13.640
Oh shit
Leonard?! Len open the fucking door.

33:13.640 --> 33:15.320
Len? Please, Len?

33:15.320 --> 33:16.960
You knew didn't yeah..?
Len? Len?

33:17.080 --> 33:18.600
All the way from the
fucking airport.

33:18.600 --> 33:19.920
Yeah, alright Dad, alright.

33:21.520 --> 33:24.280
You enjoyed that did yer?
Telling us he had fuck all.

33:24.280 --> 33:25.520
Don't start Dad. Please.

33:25.520 --> 33:28.560
Why did you wait till now eh, to
tell us that he was potless.

33:28.560 --> 33:30.040
What did I do to deserve this?

33:30.040 --> 33:32.640
I'm sorry it weren't what you
wanted to hear, alright.

33:32.640 --> 33:33.720
What do you mean potless?

33:33.720 --> 33:37.680
I bathed you. I fed you.
I fucking clothed you.

33:37.680 --> 33:39.680
You never wanted for anything.
Yeah Dad, just-

33:39.680 --> 33:41.200
You keep out of it.

33:42.160 --> 33:45.960
Where did I go wrong, son?
Maybe it was having you.

33:45.960 --> 33:47.280
Dad. Please.

33:48.360 --> 33:51.000
Well, you got what you wanted,
didn't yer. I'm the fool.

33:51.800 --> 33:55.600
Going home broke. You win Gene.

33:55.600 --> 33:57.040
You're the better man. Happy?

34:08.320 --> 34:10.400
We are going home, Ma.

34:20.160 --> 34:21.520
Don't be too hard on him Gene.

34:24.680 --> 34:26.880
He's found this whole
thing really difficult.

34:28.240 --> 34:30.880
Truth is, he just wants
you close to him.

34:41.480 --> 34:45.920
Come home with us, babe. There's
nothing here for you.

34:47.720 --> 34:49.520
What about Cindy? She'd
be stuck here.

34:50.520 --> 34:53.680
Darling, you hardly know her.

34:55.280 --> 34:58.080
Don't you think things have gone
pear shaped, since you've

34:58.080 --> 35:00.240
been wrapped around her..?

35:00.240 --> 35:02.600
She's hardly the marigolds
in a sink type, is she?

35:05.440 --> 35:08.160
What are you trying to say, Mum?

35:08.160 --> 35:10.640
I'm saying we look out for each
other in this family.

35:14.400 --> 35:16.160
And Cindy'll always land
on her feet.

35:23.360 --> 35:26.080
Think about it. For me.

35:31.240 --> 35:33.080
I love you son.

35:39.120 --> 35:42.720
I was just saying how unfair
I think Albert's been.

36:13.320 --> 36:15.320
What if we didn't sell them?

36:16.960 --> 36:21.680
The deeds. Maybe your
uncle was right?

36:21.680 --> 36:23.320
Maybe we're sitting on a fortune?

36:25.440 --> 36:27.920
What do we know about hotels?

36:27.920 --> 36:30.240
It's not just about a hotel -
it's about freedom.

36:33.160 --> 36:35.960
Your Dad's got his hand around
your throat, and it'll never

36:35.960 --> 36:37.720
change unless you break free.

36:42.200 --> 36:46.440
Why did you really go back
and steal them deeds?

36:46.440 --> 36:48.280
You risked everything.

36:49.560 --> 36:53.760
This could be your time Gene -
but you gotta take it.

36:53.760 --> 36:57.480
Break free from you family and
make a name for yourself.

37:01.640 --> 37:02.920
Emilio Suarez?

37:02.920 --> 37:05.920
Yeah. He designed the hotel model
for Tony. He's gonna help us.

37:10.160 --> 37:12.440
I just wanted to say thank you
so much for seeing us

37:12.440 --> 37:15.560
Mister Suarez, and what a beautiful
place you're building here.

37:15.800 --> 37:17.320
No, thank you, it's my pleasure.

37:17.720 --> 37:22.920
Your Uncle was one of the most
charming guys I ever met.

37:22.920 --> 37:24.560
Charming, indeed. We're gutted.

37:26.640 --> 37:33.120
Hmm. You know this was his
favourite cigar, Cohiba Epicure.

37:34.400 --> 37:38.560
We would sit and smoke together for
hours and err, every time I

37:38.560 --> 37:43.520
built a new hotel, he would tell me
that his was gonna be bigger

37:43.520 --> 37:48.040
and greater, you know,
always with this energy.

37:48.040 --> 37:52.880
Oh man. If life rewarded dreamers,
he would have been a millionaire.

37:52.880 --> 37:53.920
That's for sure.

37:53.920 --> 37:58.240
That sounds like Tony. Who
actually builds these places?

37:58.240 --> 38:01.440
Gitanos - local gypsies.

38:01.440 --> 38:05.880
They work like cart horses - “for
peanuts” - as Tony used to say.

38:05.880 --> 38:08.680
And what are the building laws like?
My uncle said they were relaxed.

38:08.680 --> 38:09.880
Yeah. He was right.

38:09.880 --> 38:14.200
The only law here is Cesar Cabrol,
he's the local mayor.

38:14.200 --> 38:17.440
But get him on side and you
can build anything.

38:17.440 --> 38:20.400
And with that land, the
world is your oyster.

38:21.640 --> 38:23.360
We're gonna do this
Cind. You and me.

38:24.200 --> 38:26.840
Get the Mayor on side and
get shot of my family.

38:26.840 --> 38:29.960
Let's stick a big fuck off hotel,
right in the middle of that land.

38:30.240 --> 38:31.920
Look at you.

38:35.920 --> 38:38.080
Just fuck off!
Shut up, where the fuck are they?

38:38.080 --> 38:41.120
What the hell?

38:41.120 --> 38:42.520
I am not talking to you!

38:42.520 --> 38:43.800
Dad, dad, what's going on?

38:44.560 --> 38:46.000
Gene just.
Just shush.

38:46.000 --> 38:48.880
We made a deal with your brother,
and we're not leaving until

38:49.040 --> 38:50.440
we get what we came for!

38:50.440 --> 38:52.480
You're Tony's family,
it's your debt now!

38:53.000 --> 38:55.280
What's he talking about Gene?
I don't know, Dad.

38:55.280 --> 38:57.520
We've no idea what you're
fucking talking about.

38:57.520 --> 39:00.840
We paid two million pesetas for a
beach, but he never gave us

39:00.840 --> 39:03.120
the deeds!
Beach? What fucking beach?

39:03.120 --> 39:07.080
Huh, you know what beach -
you fucking own it man!

39:07.080 --> 39:08.120
It's on your land.

39:08.320 --> 39:11.280
We don't know about any beach, so if
you wanna kill us, crack on,

39:13.000 --> 39:15.760
if not, fuck off.

39:21.440 --> 39:24.400
Tony had a beach - we bought the
deeds - we had a deal.

39:24.400 --> 39:28.560
Boys, there is no beach; so, you
take whatever furniture you want.

39:28.560 --> 39:32.600
I don't want fucking furniture! I
want the fucking land or I'm-

39:32.600 --> 39:35.960
Come on then!
Argh! Go on Len, do the cunt!

39:36.840 --> 39:39.520
Ma! Get the gun!

39:41.800 --> 39:44.920
Stop it! Just get them
the fuck out of here.

39:44.920 --> 39:47.280
Get the fuck out of our house.

39:47.280 --> 39:48.320
Get out.

39:50.320 --> 39:52.720
And take your fucking
mullet with yer.

39:52.720 --> 39:55.640
You alright, Ma? Good.

39:57.080 --> 39:59.040
Let's find these fucking deeds!

40:06.000 --> 40:08.040
They're not gonna
be in the fucking sofa!

40:10.640 --> 40:13.080
Right Cindy, let's see what
you're about.

40:29.400 --> 40:30.720
Len.

40:32.680 --> 40:34.080
The desk.

40:42.960 --> 40:46.040
I fucking knew it... Another fella.

40:47.480 --> 40:49.440
Mum get down here!

41:05.240 --> 41:07.080
Go on son.

41:19.400 --> 41:23.400
This says er, what's that Carl?

41:23.400 --> 41:25.840
Land certificates.

41:29.160 --> 41:32.040
This is it! The beach!

41:33.800 --> 41:36.200
This isn't just a beach -
this is hundreds of acres.

41:39.520 --> 41:42.440
It‘s a gold mine. Oh my God.

41:43.440 --> 41:45.480
This changes everything.

41:48.120 --> 41:50.080
I fucking love you son!

41:55.320 --> 41:57.760
Yes! I'm back in the game!

42:06.880 --> 42:08.880
This is all my fault.

42:16.680 --> 42:18.360
You should go.

42:20.240 --> 42:21.240
I'm serious.

42:24.000 --> 42:27.560
I'll hand myself in.
You can go back to your life.

42:31.320 --> 42:34.800
It'll be like, you never
walked into that night club.

42:36.680 --> 42:40.960
Never met me. Your Dad can
re-live his past.

42:40.960 --> 42:43.280
And you can be part of it.

42:43.280 --> 42:45.040
Just cut me loose, Gene.

44:10.360 --> 44:12.280
Suits you.

44:17.080 --> 44:18.080
I'm proud of you Alb.

44:21.600 --> 44:23.920
You remind me of someone.

44:25.920 --> 44:27.760
The man I married.

44:30.120 --> 44:33.400
Strong, powerful.

44:34.880 --> 44:37.560
A leader.

44:37.560 --> 44:39.960
Lord by name.

44:39.960 --> 44:41.440
Lord by nature.

44:53.720 --> 44:55.320
Come on you lot! Let's celebrate.

44:56.800 --> 44:57.800
We're fucking caked!

46:06.960 --> 46:08.160
Don't worry, you didn't.

46:09.160 --> 46:12.280
I wanted to apologise. My timing
wasn't great when we met earlier.

46:13.240 --> 46:16.240
I should have seen you
were grieving.

46:16.240 --> 46:17.280
You're alright mate.

46:19.160 --> 46:21.760
