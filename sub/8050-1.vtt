01:13.890 --> 01:17.310
[FUNERAL OF OOISHI MATSUNO]

01:39.750 --> 01:41.866
- Dad
- Grandpa

01:51.846 --> 01:55.213
Grandpa really cried his heart out.

01:55.307 --> 01:57.423
That was my first time seeing him cry so hard.

01:58.728 --> 02:02.850
That is because your grandfather
really loved your grandmother.

02:03.899 --> 02:08.768
Grandma really had a happy fulfilling life.

02:09.196 --> 02:12.529
But Grandma had a hard time during the war,

02:12.616 --> 02:15.073
Like her ex-husband dying as a Special Attack Force.

02:15.828 --> 02:18.035
- Ex-husband?
- Yup.

02:19.707 --> 02:22.414
Wait a moment. That was my first time hearing that!

02:22.543 --> 02:23.749
Really?

02:24.170 --> 02:25.410
What do you mean by "really"?

02:27.923 --> 02:30.756
He is my biological father.

02:31.302 --> 02:32.291
Huh?

02:52.531 --> 02:53.361
Yes.

02:53.449 --> 02:56.111
Why are you even sleeping in till this time of the day?

02:56.202 --> 03:00.366
Is that even right for a person of
your age to be doing that still?

03:00.456 --> 03:03.289
Shut up! What do you want?

03:03.793 --> 03:06.751
Remember the talk about Grandma's ex-husband?

03:06.837 --> 03:08.077
Do you want to investigate that?

03:08.172 --> 03:08.911
Huh?

03:09.000 --> 03:11.240
That talk that we had!

03:11.300 --> 03:13.120
Mum said she is also curious about that.

03:13.344 --> 03:17.963
She didn't come to me about that.
Why don't you do it instead.

03:18.474 --> 03:21.341
What are you even saying you silly fool.

03:21.477 --> 03:24.594
This is our real biological Grandpa
that we are talking about here.

03:24.688 --> 03:25.643
Ain't you interested?

03:25.731 --> 03:26.686
I am sorry,

03:26.982 --> 03:28.973
But I am not buying that.

03:29.110 --> 03:31.317
The next year will be the 60th
anniversary for the end of WWII

03:31.403 --> 03:34.145
If we were to pursue this, maybe
we can even publish a book!

03:34.448 --> 03:35.528
Are you listening to me?

03:35.658 --> 03:38.115
I don't want to end my career with
just being a freelance writer.

03:38.202 --> 03:39.317
Please help me!

03:39.829 --> 03:42.115
So that is your aim!

03:42.206 --> 03:44.322
You can go work something out on your own.
I am hanging up.

03:44.416 --> 03:45.997
Wait! wait, wait, wait!

03:46.085 --> 03:47.871
I will pay you for this.

03:51.340 --> 03:53.922
[OOISHI]

03:56.929 --> 03:59.011
Still the same I see, Grandpa.

03:59.306 --> 04:01.718
You do have a lot of non-profitable cases.

04:01.850 --> 04:07.512
In society, a lawyer is expected to be
a very profitable profession though.

04:07.857 --> 04:10.519
Are you going to be one?

04:14.155 --> 04:15.861
As expected.

04:17.158 --> 04:21.492
After being rejected for 4 years
straight, I gotta re-think about it.

04:21.870 --> 04:25.034
Like if I really suited to take the bar exam.

04:25.624 --> 04:28.115
Well, my resolve is weak I supposed.

04:28.210 --> 04:30.952
I thought I would be able to be like Grandpa...

04:31.922 --> 04:33.037
Right?

04:34.508 --> 04:36.874
I say Kentaro,

04:37.303 --> 04:40.215
You are not here to ask about that right?

04:40.347 --> 04:42.522
You are the one who said
"Grandpa might be against

04:42.535 --> 04:44.720
it" thus you don't want
to investigate further.

04:44.894 --> 04:46.259
Investigate?

04:49.648 --> 04:51.730
Ah..yah.

04:54.737 --> 04:56.227
I see.

04:56.864 --> 05:01.574
I don't like to be investigating this in secret.

05:02.244 --> 05:03.279
No.

05:05.289 --> 05:06.745
I want you to investigate this.

05:07.666 --> 05:08.906
Huh?

05:09.210 --> 05:11.201
It is for your sake too.

05:14.965 --> 05:18.958
Miyabe Kyuuzou.
Born in 1918, Tokyo.

05:19.094 --> 05:21.836
Joined the Navy Air Service in 1934.

05:21.931 --> 05:25.799
Died in the battle of Okinawa in 1945.

05:26.268 --> 05:30.227
Yup. And he also never left a will.

05:30.606 --> 05:32.892
There was barely any trace of his life.

05:33.734 --> 05:38.430
He married Grandma in 1941, and Mum
was born in the following year.

05:38.572 --> 05:41.109
But their marriage life was only 4 years,

05:41.242 --> 05:43.949
And during that period he was
almost always on the battlefield.

05:44.536 --> 05:47.027
He was 26 when he died.

05:48.207 --> 05:49.367
26?

05:50.042 --> 05:51.873
He is the same age as you are now.

05:54.171 --> 05:55.786
What's with that?

06:01.220 --> 06:03.176
This is impossible.

06:03.889 --> 06:06.208
When there is a gap of 60
years in the generation,

06:06.221 --> 06:08.550
it became impossible
to read the writing.

06:08.978 --> 06:10.013
So what's up with this?

06:10.140 --> 06:13.138
Hurm? Ah, I tried finding
a few comrades online and

06:13.151 --> 06:16.160
wrote to them if they know
who is Miyabe Kyuuzou.

06:16.280 --> 06:18.810
And these are the replies.

06:21.073 --> 06:24.031
Huh... that many?

06:24.159 --> 06:24.818
Yup.

06:41.176 --> 06:47.172
Excuse me Hasegawa san, but do you know my grandfather?

06:49.184 --> 06:50.549
Yes I do.

06:52.180 --> 06:57.580
Well, we are trying to find out what
kind of a person our grandfather is.

07:09.872 --> 07:15.583
He is the biggest coward in the Navy Air Service.

07:16.712 --> 07:17.701
Huh?

07:17.838 --> 07:22.298
A person who views his life with utmost importance.

07:24.511 --> 07:27.093
What does that mean?

07:27.973 --> 07:29.634
In short.

07:29.892 --> 07:32.725
He is obsessed about staying alive.

07:39.735 --> 07:44.104
We, pilots, all gave our lives to the nation.

07:50.537 --> 07:55.076
But this Miyabe Kyuuzou, he
is different from all of us.

07:55.750 --> 08:01.340
Rather than winning, his guy's
only wish is to keep his own life.

08:04.760 --> 08:10.926
Even when I lost my arm, his plane made
it back safely without a single scratch.

08:11.266 --> 08:13.598
Not a single bullet pierced through it.

08:15.720 --> 08:21.460
In those chaotic fights, that is impossible!

08:25.739 --> 08:29.698
That guy did not carry through his mission.

08:32.328 --> 08:35.616
He laid hidden in somewhere faraway.

08:40.962 --> 08:45.548
I beg your pardon, but my grandfather
died as a Special Attack Force right?

08:46.090 --> 08:50.080
It is a little weird to say
such a person is a coward...

08:50.139 --> 08:51.675
If it is that guy,

08:52.516 --> 08:57.385
It must have been an order from the
uppers and he went with tears.

09:00.680 --> 09:05.720
The talk of the town menu in
this shopping district is this!

09:06.989 --> 09:08.570
Did something happened?

09:09.780 --> 09:10.880
Mum...

09:11.460 --> 09:17.240
Did you ever ask about Miyabe san?

09:21.640 --> 09:25.910
Yes. I did.

09:27.217 --> 09:30.926
"What kind of a person is he?" I asked.

09:31.805 --> 09:32.794
And?

09:34.600 --> 09:38.593
Your Grandma just smiled and did not tell me anything.

09:40.856 --> 09:45.941
Well it may be because the
marriage wasn't a blessed one.

09:48.238 --> 09:54.484
If...if that Miyabe san did not
have a very good reputation?

09:56.246 --> 09:57.452
Is that so?

09:57.539 --> 10:00.576
No, I meant "if".

10:00.980 --> 10:05.740
Since we are going to investigate about
him, what if such stuff were revealed?

10:08.717 --> 10:14.087
Since she had never talked to me
about him, it might be the case.

10:16.183 --> 10:22.725
He was known to be "the disgrace of the
Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service".

10:23.023 --> 10:26.265
He was always running away in the skies.

10:26.520 --> 10:30.633
He was responsible for
the sacrifice of several

10:30.646 --> 10:34.770
bombers for his negligence
in guarding them.

10:55.180 --> 10:56.260
Let's go.

11:03.981 --> 11:05.937
Well, my grandfather...

11:07.276 --> 11:10.939
Miyabe san was a coward right?

11:11.822 --> 11:14.154
Where did you hear that from?

11:14.283 --> 11:19.027
Everyone has been saying that...
that he was such a disgrace.

11:24.209 --> 11:25.574
Please leave.

11:26.962 --> 11:29.374
I have nothing to say to you.

11:33.468 --> 11:35.129
Wait a moment.

11:36.305 --> 11:37.795
I told you to get out of here!

11:41.935 --> 11:43.721
Just think about it.

11:44.229 --> 11:49.019
If Miyabe was a coward, why did
he join the Special Attack Unit?

12:01.955 --> 12:03.491
You want to quit?

12:03.990 --> 12:08.880
But right from the start, every uncle
has been saying the same things.

12:09.020 --> 12:12.330
"Coward", "Timid", "Fear of dying".

12:12.633 --> 12:14.874
And in the end, even "Disgrace" was mentioned.

12:15.010 --> 12:18.719
So I thought why not just say what they have
been saying, but I was yelled at instead.

12:18.847 --> 12:21.589
We are on our way to another interview,
so just what are you saying!

12:21.683 --> 12:27.724
That's why I say, this shall be
the last I am going with you!

12:30.067 --> 12:32.058
Ah....

12:32.944 --> 12:36.152
Inheriting the bloodline of such person...

12:41.578 --> 12:43.534
"Coward"...

12:45.540 --> 12:50.250
It's true that that's what all
those old guys are calling him.

12:50.379 --> 12:53.462
But that can't be help.

12:55.420 --> 13:03.880
They bothered Platoon Sergeant because of his
good skills of navigating a fighter plane.

13:04.726 --> 13:07.058
His skills were good?

13:07.437 --> 13:11.897
His skills were the best of the best.

13:12.442 --> 13:14.728
If such a person is in the platoon,

13:14.860 --> 13:19.973
He will be expected to
led the way head on

13:20.034 --> 13:22.418
with the enemy and
shoot them all down.

13:22.479 --> 13:25.100
Escaping to the higher
skies to see further.

13:25.100 --> 13:31.920
But what Platoon Sergeant did was to just swerve away.

13:33.720 --> 13:37.660
Right at the start of the battle in the air,

13:38.218 --> 13:42.928
Escaping to the higher skies to keep a lookout.

13:43.515 --> 13:49.101
He hates to be involved in the waging war,

13:49.938 --> 13:54.181
And that is the cause of the malicious rumors.

13:55.527 --> 13:57.313
Ah...

13:57.612 --> 13:59.944
Do you know anything about the Zero fighters?

14:00.449 --> 14:04.317
Ah.. I don't really know.

14:06.120 --> 14:07.640
The Zero fighter...

14:10.780 --> 14:17.120
Is really a great plane.

14:18.300 --> 14:22.620
It is able to turn sharp angles
and maintain fast speed.

14:22.660 --> 14:25.790
It is well equipped with weapons too.

14:26.308 --> 14:31.223
Thanks to that it is able to fly long distances.

14:31.772 --> 14:37.608
In that time when other planes are only
able to do a few hundred kilometers,

14:37.694 --> 14:46.818
But a Zero fighter can do 1800
miles, about 3000 kilometers easily.

14:47.220 --> 14:52.440
When the Zero fighter is paired
up with Platoon Sergeant,

14:52.834 --> 14:57.328
They can be said that they are almost invincible.

14:58.590 --> 15:03.254
But even then,

15:04.137 --> 15:09.427
Everyone still gather and gossip
and made him to be a coward.

15:09.518 --> 15:11.884
Well, I supposed that can't really be helped.

15:58.233 --> 16:02.067
No. 66! Wheels ready, hook ready.

16:02.362 --> 16:03.647
Landing!

16:03.738 --> 16:05.854
No. 66! Landing!

16:05.949 --> 16:08.315
It's coming, It's coming!

16:08.410 --> 16:10.275
Here it is!!

16:29.431 --> 16:33.094
The real landing on a carrier is
different from the training on land.

16:33.226 --> 16:36.138
Landing on the choppy waters
is like riding a wild horse.

16:37.188 --> 16:41.978
No. 68, wheels ready, hook ready. Landing!

16:42.110 --> 16:44.442
No. 68! Landing!

17:02.464 --> 17:03.954
Landed!

17:04.507 --> 17:06.167
That is some feat!

17:06.300 --> 17:08.508
That guy is no. 12 right.

17:20.857 --> 17:24.315
Have you ever landed on other carriers before?

17:25.862 --> 17:28.820
No, this is my first time landing,

17:28.907 --> 17:31.694
But I followed what the previous pilot
had taught and am able to do it.

17:32.494 --> 17:36.533
I am Master Sergeant Miyabe Kyuuzou.
Please take care of me.

17:38.667 --> 17:40.453
I am First class Airman Izaki.

17:48.009 --> 17:49.089
Hey.

17:50.845 --> 17:55.589
If you admire Miyabe's skills, you
will only be disappointed later.

17:55.976 --> 18:00.561
He is the No.1 coward in the
Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service.

18:00.855 --> 18:03.437
And his pet phrase is "treasure your life".

18:06.861 --> 18:12.072
After that we had more vigorous training.

18:13.576 --> 18:18.411
There are no rest days even
on Saturdays and Sundays too.

18:19.374 --> 18:23.538
At that point in time, the
capability of the us, 1st Air Fleet

18:25.005 --> 18:29.715
Without a doubt, is the first in the world.

18:30.802 --> 18:35.387
Because we got the best fighters in the world,

18:35.598 --> 18:40.888
Coupled with the best pilots in the world.

18:41.780 --> 18:45.718
And on top of that, Platoon
Sergeant's abilities

18:45.731 --> 18:49.680
are even better than
the rest of the group.

18:51.489 --> 18:58.110
And in no time, the battle that
will test such skills started.

18:58.788 --> 19:02.280
The start of the Pacific War,

19:03.084 --> 19:05.791
Attack on Pearl Harbor.

19:20.477 --> 19:22.763
Fighters in position ready!

21:06.207 --> 21:12.043
Hurray! Hurray! Hurray!

21:13.089 --> 21:14.875
And then...

21:15.049 --> 21:18.382
After leaving Barbers Point
Beach, we can see Ford Island.

21:19.179 --> 21:21.841
We headed for the battleships that were parked idily,

21:21.931 --> 21:24.889
And the Special Attack Unit from the Navy
Air Service launched the admirable attack!

21:25.018 --> 21:27.009
Sending torpedoes one after another.

21:29.063 --> 21:30.678
Boom!

21:33.401 --> 21:37.861
Really! We saw USS Arizona exploding!

21:37.947 --> 21:40.529
And fumes of black smoke rose up!

21:41.201 --> 21:43.237
Just like a volcano!

21:48.791 --> 21:50.327
Master Sergeant Miyabe!

21:51.711 --> 21:53.042
It's you Izaki.

21:53.129 --> 21:57.463
Why are you pulling such a long face?
Are you not happy?

22:00.845 --> 22:04.713
There were no carriers in sight.

22:05.725 --> 22:09.593
I think the battle today is a failure
if we failed to attack the carriers.

22:11.689 --> 22:16.604
On top of that, there were also 29
planes that did not make it back.

22:21.282 --> 22:22.271
Today...

22:25.411 --> 22:28.027
I saw a bomber that dived into the sea.

22:30.333 --> 22:33.370
In that instant, 3 lives were lost.

22:37.257 --> 22:38.292
It is scary.

22:41.886 --> 22:44.093
I do not wish to die.

22:47.892 --> 22:51.726
What are you saying!

22:52.840 --> 22:58.023
At that moment, I was very
disgusted with the words "I

22:58.036 --> 23:03.230
do not wish to die" that
Platoon Sergeant had said.

23:04.534 --> 23:09.494
And what Platoon Sergeant had been worrying about,

23:09.580 --> 23:13.573
The fact that we did not sink any carriers,

23:13.668 --> 23:18.503
Took a terrible turn on the
following year on 5th of June.

23:18.589 --> 23:22.832
We were hit by their sudden attack.

23:26.681 --> 23:29.593
That was the Battle of the Midway.

23:48.995 --> 23:50.860
Heave-ho!

23:51.456 --> 23:55.119
Haven't they found the enemy's carrier yet?

23:55.209 --> 23:58.542
Could they have ran away in fear of us?

24:00.548 --> 24:02.129
Look at the bombers.

24:03.718 --> 24:05.709
The torpedoes are useless in this situation.

24:08.056 --> 24:10.843
They decided that there wouldn't
be carriers in the sky.

24:16.397 --> 24:17.762
Enemy battle fleet sighted.

24:17.899 --> 24:20.060
Change all land use bombs for torpedoes.

24:20.234 --> 24:21.895
We just finished dismounting!

24:22.028 --> 24:23.393
They are too willful!

24:23.488 --> 24:25.228
Didn't you hear that?!

24:25.365 --> 24:27.947
Return the torpedoes once more! On the double!

24:28.076 --> 24:29.282
Understood!

24:30.953 --> 24:33.239
There is no time to be doing this!

24:33.373 --> 24:35.830
If the carrier is sighted we have to go immediately!

24:35.910 --> 24:38.580
But if we are using land use bombs, we
will not be able to sink the carrier!

24:38.660 --> 24:41.160
It doesn't matter if we can't sink them.
We just have got to attack first!

24:41.240 --> 24:43.320
But if that is the case, we should just
aim to sink them right from the start.

24:43.400 --> 24:45.960
If that is the case, why change
the torpedoes to land use bombs?!

24:46.094 --> 24:47.630
If our aim is the carriers,

24:47.760 --> 24:49.493
The torpedoes should have
been left as it is and

24:49.506 --> 24:51.250
wait for the announcement
for spotting the carriers.

24:52.058 --> 24:56.677
If we were to be attacked, we will be helpless!

24:59.607 --> 25:03.350
Combat air patrol pilots, to the deck immediately!

25:13.287 --> 25:14.447
Good luck!

25:15.289 --> 25:16.449
I'm off!

26:10.219 --> 26:13.052
Yes! They hit it!

26:15.183 --> 26:18.516
It is falling!

26:18.686 --> 26:20.347
Yes!

26:27.069 --> 26:28.855
Starboard!

26:44.545 --> 26:45.204
Yes!

26:45.296 --> 26:47.412
Good job!

26:47.548 --> 26:51.211
Hey! Enemy aircraft descending from above!

27:20.915 --> 27:23.327
Evacuate! Evacuate!

27:37.848 --> 27:39.930
A decoy?!

28:25.187 --> 28:31.604
That is what I saw of the Battle of Midway.

28:34.989 --> 28:41.952
Having lost our carrier, we made
emergency landing on the sea.

28:42.038 --> 28:46.327
We were later taken in by the destroyers' cutters.

28:46.459 --> 28:48.825
Dad, let's stop around here.

28:48.919 --> 28:50.955
Yes, you need a rest...

28:51.047 --> 28:55.336
No, I still have things I need to say.

28:58.679 --> 29:01.842
In the summer of 1942.

29:02.892 --> 29:06.259
We returned once to the main land,

29:06.354 --> 29:11.394
And were sent off to Rabaul.

29:12.160 --> 29:16.578
This was where the best
of the best pilots of the

29:16.591 --> 29:21.020
Imperial Japanese Navy Air
Service could be found.

29:21.160 --> 29:25.494
The well known pilots of Rabaul.

29:25.873 --> 29:31.288
Shortly, Miyabe san got promoted
to be a Platoon Sergeant.

29:31.340 --> 29:40.880
Whereas me and a guy called Koyama got
assigned to be his 2nd and 3rd pilots.

29:41.013 --> 29:42.173
Izaki!

29:47.895 --> 29:50.432
How can you even stand that Platoon Sergeant!

29:50.564 --> 29:52.100
Always flying upside down.

29:52.233 --> 29:56.522
But the bottom of a fighter is our blind spot.
He is just being cautious I guess.

29:56.612 --> 30:00.571
Even if so he is doing too much!
That is becoming the butt of a joke.

30:05.162 --> 30:08.529
Serving under that guy is an order from the uppers.

30:08.624 --> 30:10.285
There is no helping to it!

30:11.377 --> 30:14.665
Thanks to that, whenever the fight became
chaotic, we are the first to leave.

30:16.549 --> 30:20.087
I want to fight the Americans!

30:22.430 --> 30:25.763
And also that habit of being
obsessed with little details.

30:25.850 --> 30:28.762
Even raising a big ruckus when
the engine is a little off.

30:28.978 --> 30:31.720
When I am accelerating and decelerating,
the vibrations are not right.

30:31.814 --> 30:34.601
Please perform a maintenance check
through carefully once more.

30:34.692 --> 30:35.351
Yes.

30:35.443 --> 30:38.105
Even the maintenance crew are fuming at him.

31:43.969 --> 31:48.633
Platoon Sergeant, you are doing
this kind of training daily?!

31:48.724 --> 31:50.339
Yeah.

31:50.476 --> 31:52.592
Even on days we have to fly?

31:53.354 --> 31:54.389
Yeah.

31:56.273 --> 31:58.264
Why to such extents?

32:03.531 --> 32:06.523
They took this at a studio and sent it to me.

32:08.619 --> 32:10.234
My wife and my daughter.

32:11.539 --> 32:16.875
Whenever I think that "it's tough, I
want to give up", I would look at this.

32:18.671 --> 32:22.459
Even if I alone die, it will not
make a difference to the war.

32:23.050 --> 32:29.717
But the lives of my wife and
daughter will be affected greatly.

32:31.880 --> 32:38.380
That is why to me, being able to live
and return is the utmost importance.

32:42.736 --> 32:45.603
You treasured your life to that extent?

32:50.040 --> 32:55.713
To survive and return,
such speech from Platoon

32:55.726 --> 33:01.410
Sergeant is unthinkable
in that age of time.

33:03.960 --> 33:08.053
Well if you are not living
at that era, you might

33:08.066 --> 33:12.170
not be able to understand
such feelings though...

33:14.101 --> 33:17.639
That is to say,

33:19.880 --> 33:28.690
My grandfather really loved my grandmother, right?

33:30.075 --> 33:31.064
Yes.

33:34.163 --> 33:38.657
We do not speak of love,

33:38.780 --> 33:43.020
but Platoon Sergeant, for the
sake of his wife and daughter

33:43.500 --> 33:49.830
Spoke clearly and strongly of how he
had wanted to survive and return.

33:51.013 --> 33:53.880
In our era, that is unmistakably,

33:54.808 --> 33:59.768
The same as saying "I love you".

34:08.072 --> 34:11.280
So he is not just a coward.

34:13.000 --> 34:20.489
But in a short while, a battle that is hard
to determine the fate of our lives started.

34:21.120 --> 34:26.088
The biggest battlefield of
the Pacific war that plagues

34:26.101 --> 34:31.080
the islands of Guadalcanal
and Solomon islands

34:31.600 --> 34:36.213
The Imperial Japanese Navy
sent out the best pilots

34:36.226 --> 34:40.850
and those who took part
in Pearl Harbour attacks,

34:40.938 --> 34:44.647
Resulting in the lost of most pilots.

34:48.654 --> 34:51.862
Everyone! Gather again at the command post!

34:51.949 --> 34:55.862
The air attack on Rabi is canceled.
We are heading for new targets!

34:58.410 --> 35:06.500
Even if they are called cowards, the
Allied waited for our airbase to be built,

35:08.716 --> 35:14.052
They attacked upon its completion,
wiping out that little forces are left,

35:15.389 --> 35:17.004
Taking over the airbase!

35:18.809 --> 35:20.390
And we, from now on,

35:21.353 --> 35:25.722
Will carrying out a bomb attack
on Guadalcanal's land forces.

35:26.233 --> 35:28.189
This shall also be an attack to show our condolences.

35:30.154 --> 35:31.143
The end.

35:31.864 --> 35:32.899
Salute.

35:34.533 --> 35:35.568
At ease.

35:37.786 --> 35:40.243
Dismiss!
Roger!

35:43.083 --> 35:45.916
270 miles to Shortland Islands.

35:46.045 --> 35:48.081
540 miles.

35:49.173 --> 35:50.413
20...

35:51.759 --> 35:53.750
560 miles?

35:54.803 --> 35:58.011
This is impossible. We can't fight with this distance!

36:01.268 --> 36:04.852
Miyabe, what did you just say?

36:06.648 --> 36:08.639
Why are you always saying such things?

36:09.109 --> 36:10.599
Get yourself together!

36:13.363 --> 36:16.776
You are demoralizing the troop!
Don't you dare say that again!

36:29.630 --> 36:33.623
Platoon Sergeant! Why did you say such things!

36:33.759 --> 36:35.090
In the first place,

36:35.177 --> 36:36.963
Does Platoon Sergeant know anything about Guadalcanal?

36:37.054 --> 36:41.548
I don't, but I know what does 560 miles translate to.

36:42.976 --> 36:44.807
We can only reach there in 3.5 hours.

36:44.937 --> 36:47.804
And this 3.5 hours includes being
on the look out for enemies.

36:48.148 --> 36:50.309
Taking into consideration the
fuel you need to come back,

36:50.526 --> 36:54.144
Fighting in the skies of Guadalcanal
is probably a mere 10 mins.

36:55.781 --> 36:58.363
I can imagine what kind of a fight it will become.

37:04.498 --> 37:08.116
Just as what Platoon Sergeant had said.

37:58.552 --> 38:00.167
What's up?

38:03.974 --> 38:05.384
I am going back!

38:05.601 --> 38:07.387
Going back to do a suicide bombing?

38:07.769 --> 38:08.975
No!

38:13.901 --> 38:15.186
Stop!

38:23.035 --> 38:24.991
Platoon Sergeant...

38:52.231 --> 38:53.437
Yes!

39:10.207 --> 39:11.617
Damn it!

39:39.945 --> 39:43.984
I will seek for emergency help right away!
Do what you can and endure!

39:44.491 --> 39:48.154
Koyama! Hang in there!!

40:11.184 --> 40:16.099
There is no sign of Staff Sergeant
Koyama at the landing spot.

40:20.277 --> 40:21.437
What happened?

40:23.196 --> 40:24.561
At the landing spot,

40:26.658 --> 40:28.194
There were sharks swimming about.

40:41.882 --> 40:43.213
Platoon Sergeant!

40:43.842 --> 40:46.675
Why did you not let him perform a suicide bombing!?

40:47.679 --> 40:49.886
Rather than being eaten by sharks,

40:50.000 --> 40:54.630
Koyama would definitely feel happier dying
courageously in a head on with the enemies!

40:55.729 --> 40:58.220
At that time there was still a chance
that he could have been saved.

40:58.350 --> 41:00.280
Do you seriously think that he could be saved?!

41:00.280 --> 41:01.590
I don't know!

41:01.943 --> 41:04.810
But if he did a suicide bombing,
he would have definitely died.

41:04.905 --> 41:08.818
You can die anytime, but it takes effort to live on.

41:08.909 --> 41:10.194
Anyway,

41:11.244 --> 41:14.736
There is no chance that we will survive this war.

41:16.333 --> 41:18.369
If I were shot down,

41:19.169 --> 41:20.909
Please just let me do a suicide bombing!

41:21.296 --> 41:23.787
Izaki, you still don't get it?!

41:24.674 --> 41:26.414
Don't you have family?

41:26.635 --> 41:29.627
Don't you have people who will
feel sad for you if you die?

41:31.473 --> 41:32.804
Answer me Izaki!

41:37.938 --> 41:41.351
I still have my father and mother back in my hometown.

41:41.733 --> 41:43.098
Only that?

41:45.529 --> 41:46.769
I also have a brother.

41:47.447 --> 41:50.359
Will your family not feel sad if you die?

41:54.955 --> 41:56.161
No...

41:57.624 --> 41:59.615
Then don't die!

42:00.210 --> 42:04.795
No matter how hard it is, put
in effort to continue living!

42:07.134 --> 42:09.375
Before and after that,

42:09.469 --> 42:15.806
That was the only time that I had
a scolding from Platoon Sergeant.

42:17.460 --> 42:25.140
That's is why his words had stayed
deep inside my heart until now.

42:26.820 --> 42:36.360
The words of Platoon Sergeant kept me going
in an incident after I have left Rabaul.

42:36.480 --> 42:40.953
In 1944, at the Battle
of the Philippine Sea,

42:40.966 --> 42:45.450
a Grumman lying in ambush
shot my fuel tank.

42:46.460 --> 42:53.670
That is the closest shave I had
with an enemy plane till date.

42:54.514 --> 42:56.220
At that time...

43:00.520 --> 43:03.853
Izaki, you still don't get it?!

43:07.986 --> 43:13.401
Platoon Sergeant's voice resonated in my mind.

43:15.368 --> 43:21.705
In the next moment I descended rapidly and escaped.

43:22.800 --> 43:30.580
My fuel got used up quickly and I
made an emergency landing on the sea.

43:32.052 --> 43:37.718
I swam for 9 hours in fear of sharks.

43:40.700 --> 43:52.350
I fell into a despair many times but each
time I was saved by Platoon Sergeant's voice.

43:53.114 --> 43:57.733
No matter how hard it is, put
in effort to continue living!

44:00.340 --> 44:10.370
When I was standing at the death abyss, I
finally understood the meaning of his words.

44:12.384 --> 44:15.592
Thanks to that I survived till today.

44:15.720 --> 44:22.970
If not for Platoon Sergeant, my
daughter would not have been born.

44:30.940 --> 44:37.270
Now, I can clearly say.

44:39.452 --> 44:44.947
Having chose to live like that during that era,

44:45.333 --> 44:48.951
Platoon Sergeant is stronger than any other people.

44:49.879 --> 44:55.465
And because he is a strong person, he
is able to persist in living like that.

44:57.846 --> 45:03.432
He is definitely not a coward.

45:11.943 --> 45:13.808
But in the end,

45:15.140 --> 45:23.030
My grandfather did not manage to see my
grandmother and my mother before his end right?

45:24.160 --> 45:29.148
No, there is just this once.
After the Pearl Harbor

45:29.161 --> 45:34.160
attack, Akagi was docked
at Yokosuka Harbor.

45:35.216 --> 45:35.955
Huh?

45:36.180 --> 45:44.710
At that time Platoon Sergeant spoke
about returning back to his hometown.

45:48.160 --> 45:50.360
[MIYABE]

46:03.953 --> 46:05.033
Dear!

46:05.622 --> 46:06.862
What's wrong?

46:10.627 --> 46:13.835
There is nothing wrong...

46:16.049 --> 46:19.086
If you are coming back, please contact me!

46:19.386 --> 46:21.593
Ahh I am terribly sorry...

46:21.721 --> 46:24.884
Docking in Yokosuka Harbor is
an highly confidential matter.

46:26.476 --> 46:27.556
Where is Kiyoko?

46:42.534 --> 46:45.901
Are you Kiyoko?

46:48.400 --> 46:53.540
Here, here Kiyo chan.

46:55.220 --> 46:59.990
Here, see? It's dad!

47:05.724 --> 47:07.760
She's so small!

47:11.855 --> 47:13.265
Kiyoko.

47:26.828 --> 47:29.160
How is the bath water?

47:30.290 --> 47:33.123
Matsuno! It's terrible Matsuno!

47:34.294 --> 47:35.625
What happened!?

47:43.803 --> 47:46.465
Ah...

47:46.760 --> 47:50.670
I got careless in the bath, but she is such a calm one.

47:50.810 --> 47:53.722
She is enjoying I guess.

47:54.647 --> 47:57.309
Right? Kiyo chan.

47:59.819 --> 48:03.061
It is nice to be in the bath with daddy right?

48:21.299 --> 48:22.539
Goodbye.

48:24.219 --> 48:25.755
I shall be on my way.

48:28.348 --> 48:29.508
Please...

48:31.100 --> 48:32.510
Be safe.

48:43.530 --> 48:44.861
Matsuno.

48:52.372 --> 48:53.657
Definitely...

48:56.042 --> 48:57.532
I will be back.

49:01.631 --> 49:03.713
Even if I lost an arm,

49:06.094 --> 49:08.756
Or even a leg, I will be back.

49:12.141 --> 49:14.052
Even if I am dead,

49:17.772 --> 49:20.138
I will still be back.

49:22.902 --> 49:24.938
Even if I am reborn,

49:26.698 --> 49:29.735
I will definitely be back to you and Kiyoko

49:37.834 --> 49:39.790
It is a promise...

50:10.283 --> 50:14.117
To tell the truth, I am in the last stage of cancer.

50:15.288 --> 50:16.323
Huh?

50:16.456 --> 50:22.122
Half a year ago, my doctor
told me I still have 3 months.

50:22.640 --> 50:30.080
But some how after half a year
until now, I am still alive.

50:33.600 --> 50:43.180
As for why my life has held out till
today, I think I understand now.

50:44.817 --> 50:48.856
It is for me to tell this tale.

50:50.615 --> 50:56.827
For the sake of me telling you the
tale of Platoon Sergeant I guess.

51:11.886 --> 51:13.672
Platoon Sergeant,

51:15.390 --> 51:19.258
I saw your grandchildren.

51:21.521 --> 51:22.886
Platoon Sergeant,

51:26.025 --> 51:28.357
Can you see this?

51:39.700 --> 51:44.540
I... want to know more.

51:45.628 --> 51:46.708
Yup.

51:47.213 --> 51:50.080
I want to know even more!

51:51.259 --> 51:52.248
Yup.

51:59.180 --> 52:08.390
Before being able to return to his wife
and daughter, he gave his all to not die.

52:19.495 --> 52:22.077
I am good with this.

52:23.249 --> 52:27.743
I had just wanted to hear that.

52:40.266 --> 52:43.804
To think we had even met once!

52:49.275 --> 52:53.439
But if that is the case, why?

52:55.948 --> 52:56.937
Hurm?

52:58.117 --> 53:02.781
Why did grandfather chose to
be in the Special Attack Unit?

53:21.140 --> 53:23.051
And at 10am...

53:26.470 --> 53:28.360
Takeda Chairman, I have something to talk to you about.

53:28.420 --> 53:29.970
It's you again!

53:30.060 --> 53:31.650
I thought I told you that he has no time for you!

53:31.660 --> 53:33.486
It is about the investigation of Miyabe Kyuuzou!

53:33.560 --> 53:34.810
Please behave yourself!

53:37.156 --> 53:38.987
Miyabe Kyuuzou?

53:40.326 --> 53:41.987
Yes, please.

53:44.288 --> 53:45.869
Well...

53:46.499 --> 53:50.333
With that all my appointments
in the morning are canceled.

53:50.586 --> 53:53.999
Ah.. I am sorry.

53:55.675 --> 53:58.087
You do look a little like him.

54:02.390 --> 54:05.757
I remember Instructor very well.

54:07.436 --> 54:12.396
When we first met, Miyabe san is the
Instructor for our prep school.

54:13.234 --> 54:16.943
In 1945, the war worsened.

54:17.280 --> 54:20.522
Even us students, who had been exempted
from serving the army in the past,

54:20.867 --> 54:24.780
Are ordered to served the nation.

54:25.860 --> 54:30.438
With both strength and brains,
this condition allows

54:30.451 --> 54:35.040
us students all to be
groomed to become pilots.

54:36.132 --> 54:41.047
We were enlisted in the Imperial
Japanese Navy Air Service,

54:41.179 --> 54:43.420
And received harsh training.

54:43.556 --> 54:47.890
But there is almost no practices scheduled
for learning how to fight in the air.

54:48.895 --> 54:50.260
Why do you think that is so?

54:53.400 --> 54:59.470
Right from the start, we students are all
trained for the Special Attack Unit.

55:01.080 --> 55:05.110
At first, we also have no idea that we are
training for the Special Attack Unit.

55:05.745 --> 55:12.241
But once the training is over and before
the assignment for the real battle,

55:12.376 --> 55:13.843
The slip of paper to confirm
our voluntary participation

55:13.856 --> 55:15.334
in the Special Attack
Unit was given out.

55:16.520 --> 55:21.960
The shock of getting that slip
of paper is beyond imagination.

55:22.060 --> 55:26.280
But after 3 days, most of the students
decided to participate voluntarily.

55:27.830 --> 55:29.260
[TAKEDA TAKANORI]

55:29.268 --> 55:35.935
In actual fact, of the 4400 people who
had died as a Special Attack Force,

55:36.317 --> 55:40.356
Around half are students like me from the prep school.

55:40.446 --> 55:41.606
Yes!

55:41.739 --> 55:44.071
Take note of the lateral wind when landing.

55:44.158 --> 55:46.945
Yes!
That is all. The end.

55:47.078 --> 55:48.067
Salute!

55:49.997 --> 55:50.986
At ease!

55:52.541 --> 55:53.371
Dismissed!

55:53.459 --> 55:54.448
Roger!

56:00.675 --> 56:01.835
Instructor Miyabe!

56:05.471 --> 56:08.463
I should have passed today right?

56:09.892 --> 56:11.302
Failed.

56:13.560 --> 56:17.608
What is the meaning of that. I did
well in the real attack practice!

56:17.640 --> 56:21.350
I was surprised that you performed very well.

56:22.113 --> 56:25.480
If that is so, then why? Explain to me!

56:31.247 --> 56:32.487
Failed.

56:34.000 --> 56:35.615
Failed, failed, failed!

56:37.211 --> 56:40.169
When will that person let me pass!

56:40.840 --> 56:45.004
At this rate, we will never get
to go out on the battlefield.

56:46.840 --> 56:52.760
I heard that that person was useless as he
has been running away at the front line.

56:53.019 --> 56:55.852
That must be why they sent him back to the mainland!

56:58.357 --> 56:59.767
Such troublesome matters.

57:04.739 --> 57:06.354
Rumors has it,

57:07.533 --> 57:10.570
That person has rejected being in the
Special Attack Unit back in Philippines.

57:11.620 --> 57:16.284
Now it is making sense!

57:17.668 --> 57:20.000
In short, that Miyabe is a coward!

57:20.087 --> 57:22.419
But yet he refused to pass us.

57:23.507 --> 57:25.589
He must be jealous that we are getting better.

57:25.968 --> 57:29.051
Is that really true, his rejection
of being in the Special Attack Unit.

57:29.555 --> 57:31.045
I have no idea.

57:32.433 --> 57:36.847
But if we are talking about
that coward, it may be true.

57:38.022 --> 57:41.264
No. 38! Descending!

57:52.286 --> 57:54.572
No. 51! Descending!

57:54.955 --> 57:56.911
Oh! Here comes Ito!

57:57.041 --> 57:58.156
He is up next!

58:16.769 --> 58:19.476
Ito! Ito!!

58:30.199 --> 58:33.111
The dead prep school private is
lacking discipline in his spirit.

58:34.995 --> 58:38.112
What rubbish is this, destroying an important plane.

58:40.220 --> 58:43.243
Losing his life before
meeting the enemy, he

58:43.256 --> 58:46.290
is a disgrace to the army,
an disloyal person.

58:47.500 --> 58:52.880
Major, that is not true.

58:55.182 --> 58:57.969
The deceased 2nd Lieutenant Ito is a great man.

58:58.519 --> 59:01.477
He is not a disgrace to the army.

59:08.487 --> 59:09.602
You...!

59:18.706 --> 59:21.072
2nd Lieutenant Ito is a great man.

59:21.167 --> 59:23.533
As a Special Attack Unit Training
Officer what are you saying!

59:31.594 --> 59:33.505
I heard about your rumors.

59:34.013 --> 59:36.220
You have not been passing these guys right?

59:38.017 --> 59:39.848
Do you not wish to send them
to the Special Attack Unit?

59:41.562 --> 59:42.722
Huh?

59:46.150 --> 59:49.563
Just when this country is facing a crisis of survival,

59:50.362 --> 59:52.193
You are such a disgrace!

59:54.033 --> 59:56.399
Stand up. Stand up!

01:00:00.831 --> 01:00:02.412
Stand up!

01:00:21.519 --> 01:00:24.056
Instructor Miyabe!

01:00:24.146 --> 01:00:25.477
Instructor...

01:00:25.898 --> 01:00:27.354
Are you alright?

01:00:28.943 --> 01:00:32.902
Yeah, just as what you see.

01:01:14.446 --> 01:01:16.152
Enemy aircraft to your right!

01:01:16.907 --> 01:01:17.942
Disperse!

01:01:41.307 --> 01:01:42.638
Damn!

01:03:37.798 --> 01:03:39.163
Hang in there!

01:03:39.883 --> 01:03:41.419
Are you alright?

01:03:42.261 --> 01:03:44.422
Why did you do such a stupid thing?

01:03:44.513 --> 01:03:48.097
Instructor Miyabe is someone that Japan needs.
We cannot let you die.

01:03:48.225 --> 01:03:51.558
No! You are the one who is
supposed to continue living on.

01:03:51.645 --> 01:03:54.102
You should live on and do great
things for this country!

01:04:04.825 --> 01:04:06.190
I was careless.

01:04:08.912 --> 01:04:13.531
I can fully understand the feelings
of that prep school private.

01:04:18.172 --> 01:04:23.257
After that I was sent to Kyuushu's Tomitaka Airbase,

01:04:23.802 --> 01:04:26.635
And did not manage to meet Instructor again.

01:04:28.265 --> 01:04:32.474
When I heard that Instructor has
died as a Special Attack Force,

01:04:34.104 --> 01:04:35.719
I couldn't bear it.

01:04:37.191 --> 01:04:41.901
That person ought to have survived.

01:04:45.949 --> 01:04:49.817
Why did my grandfather joined the Special Attack Unit?

01:04:52.331 --> 01:04:53.696
I have no idea.

01:04:56.001 --> 01:04:58.162
The difficult feelings of a Special Attack Force,

01:04:59.671 --> 01:05:02.663
Can only be understood by one who
was sent out to the battle field.

01:05:03.967 --> 01:05:09.678
The difference between me, a Special Attack
Force and those who never made it back,

01:05:10.307 --> 01:05:14.516
Is poles apart with a tall barrier in between us.

01:05:16.271 --> 01:05:17.681
However,

01:05:20.025 --> 01:05:25.770
I can still remember vividly the
feelings of sending off my comrades.

01:05:27.920 --> 01:05:31.528
The feelings back then are
something that even if I

01:05:31.541 --> 01:05:35.160
want to forget, I would
probably not be able to.

01:05:43.715 --> 01:05:45.706
Do you have a job now?

01:05:45.801 --> 01:05:47.587
I am still retaking my Law exam...

01:05:47.719 --> 01:05:52.213
No, I am just bumping around.

01:05:52.558 --> 01:05:54.173
I am embarrassed to say that.

01:05:54.268 --> 01:05:55.724
You will be fine.

01:05:55.811 --> 01:05:56.971
Huh?

01:05:57.062 --> 01:06:00.395
You have inherited Instructor Miyabe's bloodline.

01:06:00.983 --> 01:06:03.565
Surely you will be pursuing a fabulous career.

01:06:04.194 --> 01:06:06.901
Please live your life fully for
the sake of Instructor too.

01:06:09.783 --> 01:06:10.898
I understand.

01:06:12.327 --> 01:06:15.410
I would never have expected such a day to come.

01:06:16.206 --> 01:06:20.745
The day I can tell Instructor's
grandchildren about myself.

01:06:27.509 --> 01:06:30.421
Landing on an island due to an engine fault,

01:06:30.554 --> 01:06:32.920
That could have been one of your alternatives.

01:06:36.184 --> 01:06:42.145
Why did you choose to be a Special
Attack Force, Kyuuzou san?

01:06:51.158 --> 01:06:52.113
Yes.

01:06:52.200 --> 01:06:55.158
Hey Kentarou, you're late! Where are you now?

01:06:57.289 --> 01:06:58.620
Oh!

01:06:58.749 --> 01:07:00.831
That's just like a school trip!

01:07:00.959 --> 01:07:02.199
Then how about Saipan?

01:07:02.294 --> 01:07:03.750
Why are you being so stingy?

01:07:03.837 --> 01:07:06.374
If we are going with girls, it has to be Hawaii right?

01:07:06.465 --> 01:07:09.798
Hawaii is good! Let's go to Hawaii!

01:07:10.761 --> 01:07:11.796
Wow...

01:07:13.639 --> 01:07:16.301
Huh? The dress code for today is suits?

01:07:16.391 --> 01:07:19.599
Fool! There will be girls today,
this dress code is really bad.

01:07:19.686 --> 01:07:20.596
Really?

01:07:20.660 --> 01:07:22.388
We are trying to get the
tension up by telling them

01:07:22.401 --> 01:07:24.140
what kind of a resort we are
going to bring them to!

01:07:24.274 --> 01:07:28.017
This is a team play! I am begging
you, don't pull us down!

01:07:28.904 --> 01:07:29.984
Resort?

01:07:30.072 --> 01:07:32.814
Saipan or Okinawa or...

01:07:32.908 --> 01:07:34.068
Hawaii!

01:07:34.993 --> 01:07:36.324
Sorry to keep you waiting!

01:07:36.411 --> 01:07:40.245
Good evening, this way please. Take a seat please.
It has been long since we met!

01:07:40.332 --> 01:07:41.868
Nice to meet you!

01:07:43.794 --> 01:07:45.000
Special Attack Unit?

01:07:45.545 --> 01:07:46.625
Yup.

01:07:46.713 --> 01:07:48.499
Digging about in history again...

01:07:48.632 --> 01:07:52.170
Say, is there even time for you to be doing that?

01:07:54.179 --> 01:07:58.013
Oh well, Kentaro has his own way of thinking I suppose.

01:07:58.100 --> 01:08:00.807
But I must say, suicidal terrorism
is not something just of the past.

01:08:00.894 --> 01:08:04.853
Suicidal terrorism? Why are you talking about this!

01:08:04.940 --> 01:08:09.604
I beg your pardon, but suicide terrorism
is different from the Special Attack Unit.

01:08:11.446 --> 01:08:14.188
It is the same. In short both
are results of brain washing.

01:08:14.324 --> 01:08:18.317
No, they are different. The target of the
Special Attack Unit is navy aircraft carriers.

01:08:18.412 --> 01:08:20.868
Carriers are machines of mass destruction.

01:08:20.997 --> 01:08:24.786
They are totally different from suicidal
terrorism that kills normal innocent people.

01:08:25.210 --> 01:08:28.452
I can't really follow such talks.

01:08:28.546 --> 01:08:30.002
Right?

01:08:31.008 --> 01:08:33.169
It is not about such side issues.

01:08:33.260 --> 01:08:37.380
More like it is the fundamentals of one
giving up his life for his ideals,

01:08:37.471 --> 01:08:39.689
Look, from the eyes of
a foreigner, Special

01:08:39.703 --> 01:08:41.932
Attack Unit is the same
as suicidal terrorism.

01:08:42.060 --> 01:08:43.925
They are crazily loyal to the country.

01:08:44.062 --> 01:08:45.268
That's why I say...

01:08:45.397 --> 01:08:46.386
Hey, hey!

01:08:46.523 --> 01:08:50.060
I have read the wills of those
Special Attack Unit members before,

01:08:50.120 --> 01:08:51.868
They think that giving
up their lives for the

01:08:51.881 --> 01:08:53.640
sake of the nation is an
honorable thing to do.

01:08:53.859 --> 01:08:56.479
I guess that can be term as some sort of a heroism.

01:08:56.616 --> 01:09:01.234
No no, I beg your pardon, but you do not even get it.

01:09:01.371 --> 01:09:03.737
I know, I know it well.

01:09:03.840 --> 01:09:09.080
You have been failing your bar exam so
much that you start to doubt who you are.

01:09:09.212 --> 01:09:11.794
You are just running away looking
for your identity right?

01:09:12.631 --> 01:09:14.462
That's why I say it is wrong!

01:09:16.428 --> 01:09:17.759
What is with that.

01:09:18.430 --> 01:09:20.421
Why are you so fired up?

01:09:20.460 --> 01:09:23.683
In the first place, it is
none of our business whether

01:09:23.696 --> 01:09:26.930
suicidal terrorism and Special
Attack Unit is the same, right?

01:09:27.022 --> 01:09:30.229
Yeah, this is a place for merry making!

01:09:30.317 --> 01:09:31.773
Right? Let's get back to drinking.

01:09:35.447 --> 01:09:37.438
Sorry, I think I should just head back.

01:09:44.872 --> 01:09:46.613
Such a troublesome guy.

01:10:37.384 --> 01:10:40.171
That sword thirsts for human blood.

01:10:42.889 --> 01:10:43.924
Kageura san.

01:10:44.015 --> 01:10:45.846
What time do you think it is now?

01:10:48.478 --> 01:10:51.686
Miyabe Kyuuzou... no...

01:10:56.120 --> 01:11:03.030
Please tell me about the story of my grandfather.

01:11:08.290 --> 01:11:11.953
It seems as if you have matured a little.

01:11:15.630 --> 01:11:21.717
You said that your own grandfather is a coward right?

01:11:25.390 --> 01:11:31.056
I thought I have nothing to say to a guy like that.

01:11:35.442 --> 01:11:37.728
Did you do more research after that?

01:11:41.198 --> 01:11:45.407
Yes, but I cannot find an answer anywhere.

01:11:50.498 --> 01:11:55.743
Why did Miyabe chose to be a Special Attack Force?

01:11:58.256 --> 01:11:59.245
Yes.

01:12:02.260 --> 01:12:05.752
I know that guy had wanted to survive.

01:12:07.060 --> 01:12:18.100
But right at the end, that guy cut
his path to his hopes himself.

01:12:22.780 --> 01:12:29.270
I... really hated that guy.

01:12:30.914 --> 01:12:33.155
I love fighting in the skies.

01:12:34.501 --> 01:12:38.494
My real world lies in the skies instead.

01:12:39.547 --> 01:12:43.131
I have no regrets even if I die being shot by an enemy.

01:12:43.677 --> 01:12:47.841
The more chaotic the war is, the more my blood seethe.

01:12:54.312 --> 01:12:59.602
I had wanted to live like a legendary sword master.

01:13:09.980 --> 01:13:18.160
But that guy would always go back
without a wound after the fight.

01:13:19.129 --> 01:13:23.873
This guy clearly avoided fighting.

01:13:24.634 --> 01:13:30.004
But yet that guy is an extremely skillful pilot.

01:13:33.059 --> 01:13:38.270
I cannot forgive the presence of such a guy.

01:13:39.607 --> 01:13:42.690
Sergeant Major Miyabe, I have a request.

01:13:44.529 --> 01:13:45.689
What is it?

01:13:46.489 --> 01:13:48.730
I wanted to do an air battle simulation with you.

01:13:52.203 --> 01:13:54.285
There is no such need.

01:13:54.372 --> 01:13:56.283
Kageura kun has very good skills after all.

01:13:56.340 --> 01:14:00.240
I heard that Sergeant Major Miyabe's air
battle simulation skill is out of the world.

01:14:00.545 --> 01:14:01.705
Please give me some pointers.

01:14:01.838 --> 01:14:03.044
I refused.

01:14:08.136 --> 01:14:10.047
Do you not want to fight?

01:14:10.680 --> 01:14:12.921
Do you think that you will lose to me?

01:15:24.879 --> 01:15:28.337
Did you finally want to fight me?
Sergeant Major Miyabe?

01:16:17.390 --> 01:16:18.926
I got you!

01:16:34.491 --> 01:16:37.073
It can't be! Why?!

01:17:22.622 --> 01:17:23.737
Shoot.

01:17:25.124 --> 01:17:28.036
Shoot me! I opened fire at you!

01:17:28.127 --> 01:17:29.867
Shoot and kill me!!

01:17:29.963 --> 01:17:34.047
Shoot me! Shoot me! Kill me!

01:17:34.133 --> 01:17:35.418
Shoot me!

01:17:37.220 --> 01:17:39.131
I do not want to make an excuse,

01:17:41.057 --> 01:17:45.016
But I really did something unforgivable.

01:17:46.938 --> 01:17:49.350
As to why the bullets missed him,

01:17:49.600 --> 01:17:57.270
He pretended to be flying straight but in
actuality he was flying off tangent on purpose

01:17:58.157 --> 01:18:03.618
As I shoot him straight on, the
bullets just seem to veer off course.

01:18:04.831 --> 01:18:07.117
That guy tested me.

01:18:08.626 --> 01:18:13.666
From that day onward, I became careful with my life.

01:18:14.882 --> 01:18:19.125
I would not die until the day I shoot Miyabe down.

01:18:20.930 --> 01:18:22.795
That was what I thought.

01:18:25.059 --> 01:18:30.144
However the war took a turn for the worse.

01:18:31.566 --> 01:18:36.651
They gathered all the forces and in
the Battle of the Philippine Sea,

01:18:37.980 --> 01:18:42.138
The Japanese army took a
huge defeat and lost the

01:18:42.151 --> 01:18:46.320
Absolute National Defense Zone,
even Saipan was captured.

01:18:47.332 --> 01:18:53.453
The enemy chased all the way till
the Philippine Sea and Okinawa.

01:19:02.680 --> 01:19:10.340
Being cornered, the Japanese
army turned to crazed tactics.

01:19:13.650 --> 01:19:15.015
That was the Special Attack Unit.

01:19:17.987 --> 01:19:24.028
When I heard about the Special
Attack plan, I shuddered.

01:19:26.371 --> 01:19:31.115
This war has evolved until such stage.

01:19:34.712 --> 01:19:41.049
If there was a chance of survival in this
battle plan, I would have gladly went.

01:19:42.845 --> 01:19:47.134
But for the Special Attack plan,
there is no chance of survival.

01:19:48.309 --> 01:19:51.051
The success of the plan equals to death.

01:19:52.063 --> 01:19:54.054
This cannot be called a strategy plan!

01:19:56.567 --> 01:20:03.484
"If such strategy can be formulated,
Japan has lost" I thought.

01:20:05.451 --> 01:20:08.158
After that, I was order to go elsewhere,

01:20:08.746 --> 01:20:11.362
And I had to be separated from Miyabe.

01:20:12.542 --> 01:20:15.875
This time I was sent to Kanoya Airbase in Kyuushu.

01:20:16.260 --> 01:20:22.580
As a guard for the Special Attack Units, I was
to send them near to the enemy's carrier.

01:20:23.845 --> 01:20:26.131
And in that place,

01:20:26.681 --> 01:20:28.592
I met that guy again.

01:20:30.435 --> 01:20:32.096
However,

01:20:33.062 --> 01:20:40.104
That Miyabe is no longer the Miyabe that I had known.

01:21:06.471 --> 01:21:07.130
Instructor Miyabe!

01:21:07.263 --> 01:21:08.548
Oh!

01:21:09.015 --> 01:21:11.381
Teranishi! Yamada! Kagawa!

01:21:11.476 --> 01:21:13.637
How have you been!

01:21:14.020 --> 01:21:15.851
You seem to be in good spirits!

01:22:26.092 --> 01:22:27.548
Mom...

01:24:33.844 --> 01:24:35.254
That was...

01:24:37.807 --> 01:24:39.718
The Special Attack Unit.

01:24:47.358 --> 01:24:49.189
The guys who went today,

01:24:51.529 --> 01:24:53.690
Were my students.

01:25:03.749 --> 01:25:05.580
Such scenes...

01:25:11.257 --> 01:25:13.794
Are what I see daily.

01:25:28.024 --> 01:25:31.733
What do you think those guys are
able to achieve in that state?

01:25:35.740 --> 01:25:39.232
The enemy aircraft has became far
superior than the Zero fighter.

01:25:41.245 --> 01:25:44.112
The anti-aircraft artillery are improving day by day.

01:25:48.252 --> 01:25:49.742
Even today,

01:25:53.090 --> 01:25:56.173
Most of the planes did not
manage to reach the carriers.

01:26:08.230 --> 01:26:10.016
Everyone...

01:26:14.445 --> 01:26:17.312
Are not meant to die like this.

01:26:20.576 --> 01:26:23.318
For the sake of Japan after the war,

01:26:25.915 --> 01:26:28.031
They are the ones who ought to have lived on.

01:26:31.587 --> 01:26:33.669
But even so,

01:26:37.968 --> 01:26:40.209
I cannot do anything.

01:26:48.604 --> 01:26:50.936
Under such circumstances.

01:26:54.693 --> 01:26:55.728
I think there is no help to it.

01:26:55.986 --> 01:26:57.817
Don't say such things so easily!

01:26:57.947 --> 01:27:01.439
How many people, how many of them you think have died!

01:27:02.159 --> 01:27:05.117
The duty of the guard planes is to
protect the Special Attack Units!

01:27:05.204 --> 01:27:09.413
Even if we have to be shields,
our duty is to protect them!

01:27:11.001 --> 01:27:12.992
But then...

01:27:15.172 --> 01:27:17.788
But then I ran away!

01:27:19.051 --> 01:27:21.212
I left them in lurch to die!

01:27:25.766 --> 01:27:31.932
I am living a prolonged life upon their sacrifices.

01:27:34.650 --> 01:27:40.270
Their deaths have allowed me to continue living.

01:27:52.251 --> 01:27:54.207
What should I do?

01:27:57.173 --> 01:27:58.879
What should I do...

01:28:00.759 --> 01:28:02.715
What should I do...

01:28:06.849 --> 01:28:08.760
What should I do...

01:28:21.220 --> 01:28:28.570
Is that the reason why Grandfather
agreed to be a Special Attack Force?

01:28:28.662 --> 01:28:30.243
I have no idea.

01:28:32.082 --> 01:28:37.827
It is as if Miyabe has one foot in the grave that day.

01:28:38.088 --> 01:28:41.421
He was emitting such aura from all over.

01:28:43.010 --> 01:28:46.878
He no longer resembles a human from this world.

01:28:49.558 --> 01:28:55.519
Around that point in time, even for us senior pilots,

01:28:57.608 --> 01:29:00.771
We had to volunteer in the
Special Attack Unit strategy.

01:29:02.821 --> 01:29:06.279
But I was adamant not to volunteer.

01:29:06.742 --> 01:29:11.281
Because I feel that dying in such a
strategy is just a waste of death.

01:29:12.289 --> 01:29:14.280
And one fine day,

01:29:15.880 --> 01:29:24.990
I saw Miyabe's name in the Special Attack Force list.

01:29:35.020 --> 01:29:36.305
What is going on?!

01:29:36.397 --> 01:29:37.933
Why is Lieutenant Miyabe in the
Special Attack Force list?!

01:29:38.023 --> 01:29:39.138
Why did you volunteer yourself!

01:29:39.275 --> 01:29:40.856
You!!

01:29:42.236 --> 01:29:45.524
Are you not happy with the decisions of the uppers?!

01:29:46.031 --> 01:29:47.271
Say it!

01:29:47.360 --> 01:29:51.940
Tell them! "Don't make a senior
pilot like me die in vain!"

01:29:52.579 --> 01:29:55.446
You saw how the Special Attack raid is like!

01:29:55.541 --> 01:29:56.906
Tell them!

01:29:58.294 --> 01:30:01.001
Tell them that most of them did not
even made it near the carrier!

01:30:01.338 --> 01:30:03.169
Tell them that most of them died in vain!

01:30:07.469 --> 01:30:09.505
It's fine, Kageura.

01:30:12.599 --> 01:30:14.089
It's fine.

01:30:14.184 --> 01:30:16.049
At that moment I swear in my heart.

01:30:16.645 --> 01:30:19.557
In that case I will protect Miyabe
till the end no matter what happens!

01:30:19.690 --> 01:30:21.681
I will not let the any of the
enemies' bullets pierce him!

01:30:21.859 --> 01:30:24.896
I will shoot down every enemy
that tries to take Miyabe down!

01:30:25.029 --> 01:30:28.362
Even if I am out of bullets, I will
use my plane to bring them down!

01:30:31.535 --> 01:30:33.241
But...

01:30:34.872 --> 01:30:38.035
In the end I lost him again.

01:30:41.420 --> 01:30:44.827
The day Miyabe's plane
went off to battle, in the

01:30:44.840 --> 01:30:48.258
skies 100 miles away from
the enemy's carrier,

01:30:49.053 --> 01:30:51.544
The enemies laid in ambush and the war turned chaotic.

01:30:52.181 --> 01:30:58.222
At that time, my plane's engine started to act up.

01:31:08.405 --> 01:31:12.023
I saw Miyabe leave the air zone.

01:31:13.994 --> 01:31:16.235
I chased after Miyabe,

01:31:17.289 --> 01:31:20.076
I thought I would follow him no matter what.

01:31:20.209 --> 01:31:24.327
But I was not able to catch up to him.

01:31:26.006 --> 01:31:30.591
Miyabe's plane suddenly disappeared from my sight.

01:31:41.271 --> 01:31:43.933
There was another strange happening.

01:31:46.527 --> 01:31:50.691
On the day of attack, Miyabe was
not using his usual 52 model,

01:31:51.240 --> 01:31:53.947
But was using the old 21 model instead.

01:31:54.952 --> 01:31:59.696
Just before setting off, he had
changed plane with another pilot.

01:32:01.125 --> 01:32:02.615
Why did he do that?

01:32:02.709 --> 01:32:04.119
I have no idea.

01:32:05.003 --> 01:32:10.339
Miyabe was very insistent on going with the 21 model.

01:32:11.343 --> 01:32:14.141
It may be that he wanted
to go with the familiar

01:32:14.154 --> 01:32:16.963
model he used before the
Pearl Harbor attack.

01:32:17.641 --> 01:32:24.888
But this story has an unexpected end
to it that I wouldn't say is happy.

01:32:28.026 --> 01:32:33.817
The 52 model that Miyabe changed
from had an engine fault.

01:32:35.534 --> 01:32:38.025
The pilot was not able to reach the enemy's grounds,

01:32:38.829 --> 01:32:41.696
And was recorded to have an
emergency landing in Kikaijima.

01:32:46.587 --> 01:32:48.202
Don't tell me...

01:32:49.798 --> 01:32:55.088
The person on that plane...that survived?

01:32:55.637 --> 01:32:57.173
Yes...

01:32:59.975 --> 01:33:02.341
In a short while Okinawa fell.

01:33:03.145 --> 01:33:08.265
Till the end of war, there was
almost no more Special Attack raids.

01:33:14.907 --> 01:33:17.364
How can that be...

01:33:20.954 --> 01:33:26.369
If Grandfather has not changed his
plane, he could have been saved?

01:33:26.627 --> 01:33:28.288
That we don't know!

01:33:29.713 --> 01:33:32.705
But the probability is high.

01:33:33.360 --> 01:33:37.710
Then does that mean Grandfather himself,
gave up his last chance of survival,

01:33:37.846 --> 01:33:41.134
Even if it was a mere coincidence?!

01:33:55.739 --> 01:33:58.856
How can that happen....

01:34:08.840 --> 01:34:15.540
I wished I could have met and talked to Grandfather...

01:34:20.013 --> 01:34:21.503
At that time...

01:34:25.102 --> 01:34:26.842
During the day of the attack,

01:34:28.313 --> 01:34:31.430
The eyes that guy had after
changing over to the 21 model,

01:34:34.152 --> 01:34:37.770
Are not the eyes of someone who
had made peace about dying.

01:34:39.540 --> 01:34:48.730
The look in his eyes was as if he is
finally going back to his family.

01:34:52.671 --> 01:34:57.131
Do you wish to know who was
that person who had survived?

01:34:57.676 --> 01:34:59.917
If he is still alive, I would like to meet him.

01:35:00.220 --> 01:35:04.805
I wanted to ask about the last of him.

01:35:15.902 --> 01:35:17.312
This is the list.

01:35:20.449 --> 01:35:22.405
Thank you.

01:35:23.410 --> 01:35:25.651
It is not something you should thank me for.

01:35:28.915 --> 01:35:32.828
This is the end of my story.

01:35:39.593 --> 01:35:41.584
See the young man off.

01:35:42.179 --> 01:35:45.637
It's ok, my sister is coming to fetch me.

01:35:46.683 --> 01:35:47.923
I see.

01:35:49.353 --> 01:35:50.513
Yes.

01:36:20.384 --> 01:36:22.966
Well, I like young guys.

01:36:40.904 --> 01:36:43.896
Goodness me, what is that kid doing!

01:36:50.920 --> 01:36:55.290
Hey, you are getting drenched to the skin!
What are you doing!

01:36:56.712 --> 01:36:57.997
What happened?

01:37:01.591 --> 01:37:03.377
It's Grandpa.

01:37:03.468 --> 01:37:04.583
Huh?

01:37:05.846 --> 01:37:07.711
It is Grandpa!

01:37:10.780 --> 01:37:16.930
The pilot on the 52 model that made
an emergency landing is our Grandpa!

01:37:19.192 --> 01:37:22.605
What? What is this about?

01:37:24.281 --> 01:37:26.567
[OOISHI KENICHIRO]

01:37:26.620 --> 01:37:32.780
I thought someday, I had to tell all of you about this.

01:37:35.584 --> 01:37:40.874
Matsuno said, "There is no
need to tell the kids this",

01:37:42.632 --> 01:37:45.749
But I had wanted to tell this story.

01:37:49.514 --> 01:37:52.677
Finally, the time has come.

01:37:55.729 --> 01:37:56.889
Come.

01:38:11.077 --> 01:38:17.664
The place I met Miyabe san was at Tsukuba Airbase.

At that time, if anything were to happen,
even if I have to sacrifice myself,

01:38:49.950 --> 01:38:52.487

She is called Kiyoko, written
with the kanji for Pure and Child

you like to do after the war ends?

It doesn't matter what it is, but I would
like a job dedicated to helping people.

was burnt down by the air raids.

Having know that the two persons Miyabe
san was trying desperately to protect

01:53:22.947 --> 01:53:27.611
were living such lowly lives, pained my heart greatly.

01:53:39.040 --> 01:53:44.780
I told Matsuno about the changing
of planes with Miyabe san.

01:53:45.344 --> 01:53:50.429
And also the resulting situation
of me alone surviving the war.

01:53:53.602 --> 01:53:55.593
I had prepared myself for the worst.

01:54:00.067 --> 01:54:01.603

No! That's wrong.

01:54:33.300 --> 01:54:38.640
I cannot imagine that it is just mere coincidence
that he changed the 52 model with me.

01:54:42.276 --> 01:54:44.562

At the control seat,

I found this photo and memo.

01:55:02.140 --> 01:55:11.420
When Miyabe san got on to the 52 model,
I think he had noticed the fault in the engine.

01:55:15.960 --> 01:55:24.480
And on top of that, he left me this photo and memo.

01:56:05.100 --> 01:56:10.620
If Lieutenant Ooishi survived
this war, I have a request.

01:56:11.740 --> 01:56:15.733

Please leave.

01:56:40.227 --> 01:56:43.970
I beg of you, please leave.

01:58:16.949 --> 01:58:22.569
Since then, I tried to do whatever I could for them.

01:58:23.455 --> 01:58:26.697
When I had time, I would go travel there.

01:58:42.725 --> 01:58:47.640

Whenever I got my salary, I would make my way to Osaka.

01:59:59.843 --> 02:00:03.756
Matsuno would not accept it.

02:00:04.306 --> 02:00:08.299
But I went again and again.

02:00:09.360 --> 02:00:13.170

Why are you being so nice to us?

02:02:00.047 --> 02:02:05.883
Because my life was saved by Miyabe san

02:02:09.560 --> 02:02:16.050
Even if so, there is no need to
sacrifice your life for that.

02:02:21.360 --> 02:02:25.854
You have done more than what is needed to atone for it.

02:02:34.373 --> 02:02:38.412
I can't be relying on you any more...

02:02:38.502 --> 02:02:39.787
No, that is not it.

02:02:40.337 --> 02:02:41.918
You got me wrong.

02:02:44.549 --> 02:02:46.289
In the beginning it was a sense of duty.

02:02:47.460 --> 02:02:53.040
But gradually, coming here became a joy to me.

02:02:55.600 --> 02:03:02.620
Being able to support both of you in little
ways became an encouragement to my life.

02:03:10.492 --> 02:03:12.699
No, I will be straight about this.

02:03:12.828 --> 02:03:15.410

02:03:55.954 --> 02:03:58.491
Kept his promise.

02:04:03.420 --> 02:04:05.456
He told me.

02:04:08.884 --> 02:04:10.715
"Even if I die,"

02:04:13.555 --> 02:04:15.967
"I will still come back."

"I will still return to you and Kiyoko."

You are right here with me now.

Kept his promise.

02:06:06.960 --> 02:06:11.124
He has wanted to come back no matter what right?

02:06:13.675 --> 02:06:15.085
Why?

I cannot put it in words clearly,

I will say what I can gather in words.

02:06:31.026 --> 02:06:34.769
The one thing that I think is clear,

02:06:36.573 --> 02:06:41.112
Is that he was not afraid of death.

02:06:42.660 --> 02:06:50.160
He was more afraid of hurting
your and Matsuno's life ...

For a person who survived to have to die later,

02:07:08.063 --> 02:07:11.476
He did not want to waste that death,

02:07:13.777 --> 02:07:17.315
But instead he chose to lengthen this story.

02:07:27.249 --> 02:07:31.538
And so we both got married.

02:07:34.160 --> 02:07:41.750
Miyabe was never brought up between us as a topic.

02:07:42.460 --> 02:07:50.590
But both of us have never forgot about Miyabe san.

02:07:58.920 --> 02:08:05.700
I didn't think that both Grandpa and
Grandma had this story behind you.

02:08:07.789 --> 02:08:12.658
We are not the only special ones.

02:08:14.129 --> 02:08:18.964
In that era, every one has their story.

02:08:20.500 --> 02:08:29.300
Everyone hid their stories in their heart and
carried on living as if nothing happened.

02:08:34.460 --> 02:08:44.320
This is what it is to survive the war.

02:08:53.877 --> 02:08:55.833
In another 10 years,

02:08:57.255 --> 02:09:00.873
Our generations will cease to exist.

02:09:05.180 --> 02:09:14.720
I am glad that I am able to tell this story to you.

02:09:36.544 --> 02:09:41.538
There was another once that
such mysterious thing happened.

02:09:46.346 --> 02:09:51.841
I wanted to tell you everything frankly.

02:09:56.564 --> 02:10:00.477
Right after the war ended, I was tricked,

02:10:02.278 --> 02:10:06.362
And was living as a mistress of a certain yakuza.

02:10:09.953 --> 02:10:12.069
The reason as to why I got out of that,

02:10:14.082 --> 02:10:18.826
Was that this certain guy put his
life on the line to save me.

02:10:22.840 --> 02:10:31.090
That person came running with
a sword stained with blood.

02:10:32.930 --> 02:10:46.220
He threw a wallet at me and said to me "Live on."

02:10:49.900 --> 02:10:57.830
I see it as if it was Miyabe who had came to my rescue.

02:10:58.835 --> 02:11:00.416
Who was that person?

02:11:02.797 --> 02:11:04.458
That was the end.

02:11:07.802 --> 02:11:12.762
Because I took Kiyoko and ran to this place.

02:11:14.851 --> 02:11:17.718
I have no idea who and where he came from...

02:11:18.605 --> 02:11:20.721
I should have came faster!

02:11:21.483 --> 02:11:23.815
I was wrong to have left you alone!

02:11:24.440 --> 02:11:29.350
I was wrong and should have found you faster.

02:11:43.640 --> 02:11:49.870
Who exactly was that person,

02:11:51.888 --> 02:11:53.549
Matsuno?

02:12:32.387 --> 02:12:35.003
And what kind of country will it be then?

02:12:35.098 --> 02:12:39.592
In order to return to my wife and daughter,
no matter how tough, I can't die.

02:12:39.960 --> 02:12:44.720
To me, being able to live and
return is the utmost importance.

02:12:45.316 --> 02:12:50.060
It will be great if such a day comes.

02:12:50.947 --> 02:12:52.983
Izaki, you still don't get it?!

02:13:02.250 --> 02:13:06.789
Tolerate the intolerable, bear the unbearable,

02:13:06.921 --> 02:13:09.003
For the sake of all eternity...

02:13:13.553 --> 02:13:15.635
Show me some spirit!

02:13:25.773 --> 02:13:26.979
Miyabe.

02:13:28.109 --> 02:13:29.189
Miyabe!

02:13:30.445 --> 02:13:32.310
Are you leaving me behind? Miyabe!

02:13:40.705 --> 02:13:45.950
We shall protect the nation with loyalty...

02:13:57.764 --> 02:13:59.755
Miyabe!

02:14:00.308 --> 02:14:01.844
Miyabe san.

02:14:03.811 --> 02:14:05.927
Please forgive me.

02:14:42.100 --> 02:14:47.345
He is the No. 1 coward in the Navy Air Service.

02:14:47.605 --> 02:14:51.518
Why did Miyabe chose to be in the Special Attack Unit?

02:14:51.776 --> 02:14:55.018
He should have been the one to live and survive.

02:14:55.321 --> 02:15:01.191
This is what it means to have survive the war.

02:15:01.580 --> 02:15:10.360
In my era, that is is the same as saying "I love you".

02:15:11.520 --> 02:15:16.960
That person kept his promise.
