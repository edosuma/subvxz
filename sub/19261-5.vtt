you <i>as</i> soon <i>as</i> I can, okay?

13:12.667 --> 13:13.828
I love you, Nicole.

13:16.379 --> 13:17.665
I love you, too.

Hey, Nicole.
Andre.

13:32.228 --> 13:33.218
Can I come in for a minute?

13:34.105 --> 13:35.095
(SIGHS) Yeah.

13:38.735 --> 13:40.021
You gotta talk to Isaac.

13:41.321 --> 13:42.686
This is none
of my business.

13:43.323 --> 13:44.654
I left to get
away from all this.

13:44.741 --> 13:45.902
I just wanna get
back to my husband.

13:45.992 --> 13:47.608
You think anybody
here wouldn't kill

13:47.702 --> 13:48.692
to get out of here
like you did?

13:49.746 --> 13:51.362
We don't have that choice.
We're here.

13:52.415 --> 13:53.746
Trying to do
what we gotta do...

13:55.501 --> 13:58.334
Look, I'm asking you
to talk to him.

13:58.755 --> 13:59.745
And say what?

14:01.090 --> 14:02.672
I've never seen him
like this before.

14:02.800 --> 14:05.383
That's 'cause he wasn't like this
when you and Eric were around.

14:06.346 --> 14:07.586
Once you two bounced,

14:08.598 --> 14:09.929
everything changed.

14:11.267 --> 14:14.385
I know Eric leaving
was rough for him.

14:14.520 --> 14:15.510
It wasn't Eric.

14:16.981 --> 14:19.063
It was you leaving
that broke him.

14:20.109 --> 14:21.270
And now,

14:22.111 --> 14:24.443
you're the only one who might
be able to set him straight.

14:28.618 --> 14:30.609
(BEEPING)

14:34.499 --> 14:36.456

Is that kharcho?

14:45.134 --> 14:46.295
(CHUCKLES)

14:47.136 --> 14:48.843
It smells just
like your mother's.

14:50.473 --> 14:52.305
It always reminds me
of home.

14:58.147 --> 14:59.137
Mmm.

14:59.524 --> 15:00.855
So good.

15:06.531 --> 15:08.488
And what about you?

15:08.574 --> 15:09.735
How's work, Khasan?

15:10.660 --> 15:11.821
Work is good.

15:13.830 --> 15:15.787
Is it?
I said it's good.

15:18.835 --> 15:20.246
Because before
I came here,

15:20.336 --> 15:21.417
I stopped by
the construction site,

15:21.754 --> 15:23.961
and your boss said that you
haven't been there in weeks.

15:25.258 --> 15:26.248
They didn't need me.

15:27.093 --> 15:28.675
Don't lie to me, boy.

15:29.846 --> 15:30.927
What are you
talking about?

15:37.103 --> 15:38.889
Your friend Timur,

the drunk father,

15:41.190 --> 15:42.521
he was arrested
two weeks ago

15:42.608 --> 15:44.770
trying to plant a bomb
in Grozny Square.

15:46.904 --> 15:49.020
The police never got
anything out of him.

15:49.699 --> 15:51.189
But in the village,
people talk.

15:54.036 --> 15:56.778
There were rumors
he trained in Pakistan,

15:57.457 --> 15:58.788
that he wasn't alone.

16:01.627 --> 16:03.117
You were there with him.

16:04.881 --> 16:06.417
Tell me what
you're doing here.

16:06.883 --> 16:07.964
Nothing.
I already told you...

16:08.050 --> 16:09.040
(GRUNTS)

16:10.011 --> 16:11.501
I told you,
don't lie to me.

16:14.390 --> 16:15.721
Tell me what you two
have done.

16:22.565 --> 16:24.147
Fine, you don't
want to talk,

16:24.233 --> 16:25.223
then pack your bags.

16:25.318 --> 16:27.309
You're coming home with me.
You too, boy.

16:29.238 --> 16:30.569
We're not
going anywhere.

16:36.746 --> 16:38.703
You think you're a man
because you can shoot a gun?

16:38.831 --> 16:39.992
Huh?

16:40.875 --> 16:42.832
I fought the Russians
while you hid under the bed

16:42.960 --> 16:45.327
in your pajamas, crying like girl.
Papa, please, please...

16:45.421 --> 16:46.786
You're not a soldier,

16:46.964 --> 16:48.750

nothing but a coward!

brother control you.

18:04.041 --> 18:06.578
I know you helped Carter
access the ONIX schematics.

18:06.961 --> 18:08.372
You have no proof of that.

18:08.588 --> 18:10.374
Only because you're
good at what you do.

18:10.965 --> 18:13.798
Which means I can't
fire you for cause. Yet.

18:15.511 --> 18:16.672
But I don't trust you.

18:17.680 --> 18:18.761
I understood
siding with Rebecca

18:18.848 --> 18:19.883
when all this started,

18:19.974 --> 18:21.885
but Carter's gone
off the reservation,

18:21.976 --> 18:23.637
and you helped him do it.

I did, but he doesn't
care if he can prove it.

19:05.269 --> 19:06.259
He took away
my clearance,

19:06.354 --> 19:08.265
and he'll fire me as soon
as he figures out how.

19:09.273 --> 19:10.763

gotten involved.

gain by killing them?
