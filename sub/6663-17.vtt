00:02.669 --> 00:03.402
Adult adam:  <i>Hockey...</i>

00:03.404 --> 00:05.504
<i>A time-honored tradition</i>
<i>for the goldberg gang.</i>

00:05.506 --> 00:06.905
<i>My dad raised us</i>
<i>watching the flyers</i>

00:06.907 --> 00:11.744
<i>And dreamed of us being</i>
<i>as cool and tough as</i>
<i>the broad street bullies.</i>

00:11.746 --> 00:13.879
<i>Of course, what I lacked</i>
<i>in size and strength,</i>

00:13.881 --> 00:16.982
<i>I made up for with</i>
<i>clumsiness and asthma.</i>

00:16.984 --> 00:18.650
My costume is
so uncomfortable.

00:18.652 --> 00:21.687
It's a jersey,
not a costume.

00:21.689 --> 00:22.254
Geez.

00:22.256 --> 00:23.822
<i>It didn't matter</i>
<i>that I was a total scrub.</i>

00:23.824 --> 00:26.158
<i>My dad thought</i>
<i>I could be great someday,</i>

00:26.160 --> 00:28.527
<i>And I didn't want</i>
<i>to let him down.</i>

00:28.529 --> 00:30.696
You ready?
Hell yeah.

00:30.698 --> 00:34.299
I'm ready to
hockey it up.

00:34.367 --> 00:36.935
There he is,
my little ice angel.

00:36.937 --> 00:40.873
Remember our rule...
The real winner is safety.

00:40.875 --> 00:43.509
It's the big
leagues, bevy!

00:43.511 --> 00:44.910
He's in junior
peewee now.

00:44.912 --> 00:47.212
This is the year
that adam scores
his first goal.

00:47.214 --> 00:50.416
Murray, I don't
understand why you
insist he plays.

00:50.418 --> 00:52.418
Adam, be careful on that ice.

00:52.420 --> 00:53.318
It's very slippery.

00:53.320 --> 00:55.587
Why don't you just skate
around with him all game

00:55.589 --> 00:56.388
And make sure
he stays safe?

00:56.390 --> 00:58.490
I know you're joking,
but I would do that

00:58.492 --> 01:00.793
If the situation
presented itself.

01:00.795 --> 01:04.229
<i>Hockey wasn't my thing,</i>
<i>but it was barry's everything.</i>

01:04.231 --> 01:05.798
Whoo! What a hit!

01:05.800 --> 01:07.699
I don't think
he's getting up.

01:07.701 --> 01:10.135
I told you, flyers
got to hit to win.

01:10.137 --> 01:11.570
(grating voice)
I'm freddy krueger!

01:11.572 --> 01:13.505
I'm gonna haunt
your dreams, fool!

01:13.507 --> 01:15.107
What's he doing?
Just ignore him.

01:15.109 --> 01:16.341
(growls)
ma-ma-ma-ma-ma.

01:16.343 --> 01:17.609
He'll wear himself out.

01:17.611 --> 01:18.944
(growls)
ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma.

01:18.946 --> 01:20.546
That's enough.
That's enough.

01:20.548 --> 01:22.314
Let me watch the game.
Stop.

01:22.316 --> 01:23.282
Just watch
the game, adam.

01:23.284 --> 01:26.518
<i>My dad took hockey</i>
<i>very seriously,</i>

01:26.520 --> 01:28.020
<i>And my brother,</i>
<i>barry, did, too.</i>

01:28.022 --> 01:30.622
<i>Out of all the things he</i>
<i>thought he was good at,</i>

01:30.624 --> 01:32.024
<i>This one he actually was.</i>

01:32.026 --> 01:34.126
(buzzer sounds)
barry: Goal!

01:34.128 --> 01:36.829
<i>And my dad loved</i>
<i>going to his games.</i>

01:36.831 --> 01:38.630
Look at you!
Look at you!

01:38.632 --> 01:42.734
<i>But when it came to</i>
<i>my games, not so much.</i>

01:42.736 --> 01:44.069
Go, adam!

01:44.071 --> 01:45.270
(cheering)

01:45.272 --> 01:47.206
<i>Even so, my dad</i>
<i>dragged his ass</i>

01:47.208 --> 01:49.141
<i>To those stands</i>
<i>to cheer me on.</i>

01:49.143 --> 01:50.142
No, no!
The other way!

01:50.144 --> 01:52.678
<i>But he never stopped</i>
<i>believing that one day</i>

01:52.680 --> 01:54.079
<i>I would score</i>
<i>that first goal</i>

01:54.081 --> 01:56.548
<i>And live up to</i>
<i>the goldberg potential.</i>

01:56.550 --> 01:57.316
Do something!

01:57.318 --> 01:59.451
<i>Then, it finally happened.</i>

01:59.453 --> 02:00.185
<i>My moment...</i>

02:00.187 --> 02:04.790
<i>My big shot to</i>
<i>make my dad proud.</i>

02:05.125 --> 02:07.826
(suspenseful music playing)

02:10.497 --> 02:11.930
(buzzer sounds)

02:11.932 --> 02:13.165
<i>Or so I thought.</i>

02:13.167 --> 02:15.534
Yes! I finally scored!

02:15.536 --> 02:16.869
Yeah.

02:16.871 --> 02:19.805
Damn it, goldberg.
You scored on our goal.

02:19.807 --> 02:21.573
(crowd jeering)

02:22.642 --> 02:24.743
I call a do-over!

02:24.745 --> 02:27.546
That's a thing
in sports, right?

02:30.350 --> 02:31.350
<i>♪ I'm twisted up inside</i>

02:31.352 --> 02:36.255
<i>♪ but nonetheless</i>
<i>I feel the need to say</i>

02:37.757 --> 02:38.690
<i>♪ I don't know the future</i>

02:38.692 --> 02:41.460
<i>♪ but the past keeps getting</i>
<i>clearer every day ♪</i>

02:41.462 --> 02:44.730
Adult adam:
<i>It was February 25,</i>
<i>1980-something.</i>

02:44.732 --> 02:46.231
<i>My sister was prepping</i>
<i>for the sats,</i>

02:46.233 --> 02:49.168
<i>And my mom was gonna be</i>
<i>there every step of the way</i>

02:49.170 --> 02:51.670
<i>With words of support</i>
<i>and encouragement.</i>

02:51.672 --> 02:53.906
Okay, I don't want to make
a big deal about this,

02:53.908 --> 02:54.573
But your entire life

02:54.575 --> 02:56.542
Is literally riding
on this one test.

02:56.544 --> 02:58.844
You've made
that very clear.

02:58.846 --> 03:00.312
Now stop hovering.

03:00.314 --> 03:03.815
Sorry. I'll just be
quietly over here.

03:06.619 --> 03:08.353
(clangs)
aah! What the hell?

03:08.355 --> 03:11.390
This test is all about
how you handle distraction.

03:11.392 --> 03:12.758
Focus your mind.

03:12.760 --> 03:14.226
Shut out the world.

03:14.228 --> 03:14.793
Mom.

03:14.795 --> 03:16.495
I don't think
there are going to be

03:16.497 --> 03:18.330
Any explosions
at the test center.

03:18.332 --> 03:19.231
You don't know that.

03:19.233 --> 03:21.099
It could be underneath
a discotheque,

03:21.101 --> 03:22.668
Or next to
a fireworks factory,

03:22.670 --> 03:24.736
Or in a bad part
of south philly,

03:24.738 --> 03:27.573
Like where your gym
teacher got arrested.

03:27.575 --> 03:28.507
You're not helping.

03:28.509 --> 03:31.043
And time!
Pencils down.

03:31.045 --> 03:33.845
Okay, you didn't even answer
the last 10 questions.

03:33.847 --> 03:37.316
What's wrong with you?
You're what's
wrong with me!

03:37.318 --> 03:38.150
You know what?

03:38.152 --> 03:39.718
That's fine.
I'm done for the night.

03:39.720 --> 03:41.753
The night has
just begun, missy.

03:41.755 --> 03:42.754
Tuchus down, now.

03:42.756 --> 03:44.990
Look, my sat
tutor said that taking

03:44.992 --> 03:47.759
Too many practice
tests will burn you out.

03:47.761 --> 03:49.795
And that's why
I fired her.

03:49.797 --> 03:51.196
You fired wendy woo?

03:51.198 --> 03:52.464
I fired wendy woo.

03:52.466 --> 03:55.033
She was happy and
kind and patient! Ugh!

03:55.035 --> 03:57.302
Three terrible qualities
in a tutor.

03:57.304 --> 03:59.271
But don't worry.
I hired someone else.

03:59.273 --> 04:01.273
She'll be here
momentarily.

04:01.275 --> 04:03.141
Erica: What?
What's happening?

04:03.143 --> 04:04.643
Surprise!
No...

04:04.645 --> 04:05.978
It's me!
I'm your new tutor!

04:05.980 --> 04:09.014
Stop doing
what you're doing.
Erica...

04:09.016 --> 04:10.115
The fate of your
college career

04:10.117 --> 04:12.484
Rides on this one single
test, and trust me,

04:12.486 --> 04:14.219
I know how important
college is.

04:14.221 --> 04:17.889
The biggest regret of my life
is dropping out to have you.

04:17.891 --> 04:18.757
Oh, that sounded awful.

04:18.759 --> 04:22.060
I am just gonna
keep on talking
until it fixes itself.

04:22.062 --> 04:23.795
Has it fixed itself?
No.

04:23.797 --> 04:25.430
I think it has. Here.

04:25.432 --> 04:28.000
I've gone through tests
from the past 10 years

04:28.002 --> 04:31.136
And compiled all the most
difficult math problems.

04:31.138 --> 04:32.237
Do them now.

04:32.239 --> 04:35.007
What?
These are way too hard.

04:35.009 --> 04:37.109
I believe in you.

04:37.310 --> 04:40.112
Adult adam:
<i>While my mom was turning</i>
<i>the screws on erica,</i>

04:40.114 --> 04:42.147
<i>My dad had</i>
<i>given up on me.</i>

04:42.149 --> 04:44.449
What are you doing?
The flyers are on.

04:44.451 --> 04:45.717
I got news
for you, albert.

04:45.719 --> 04:48.387
I'm done with hockey.
That's right.

04:48.389 --> 04:50.622
Adam spoiled the
whole sport for me.

04:50.624 --> 04:51.556
It happens.

04:51.558 --> 04:53.992
Sometimes the puck
deflects off you

04:53.994 --> 04:56.161
And ricochets
into your own goal.

04:56.163 --> 04:58.530
Murray:
No! He aimed. He shot.

04:58.532 --> 05:00.699
He scored. He danced!

05:00.701 --> 05:01.600
I'm so sorry.

05:01.602 --> 05:03.969
Why don't you just
let the boy quit?

05:03.971 --> 05:05.871
He hates hockey.
For now.

05:05.873 --> 05:07.806
But when I force him
to play against his will,

05:07.808 --> 05:09.441
He'll eventually
become great.

05:09.443 --> 05:13.712
And then his
bitterness towards me
will turn into love.

05:13.714 --> 05:16.915
That, my friend,
is what it means
to be a dad.

05:16.917 --> 05:18.717
Yes,
that's very touching.

05:18.719 --> 05:20.819
But maybe you should
do something

05:20.821 --> 05:22.954
That adam likes
for a change.

05:22.956 --> 05:27.959
But he likes space ships
and dragons and video games.

05:27.961 --> 05:32.064
Did you know that
the mario brothers
aren't even real?

05:32.066 --> 05:32.664
For three years,

05:32.666 --> 05:35.233
I thought they were
the boys who lived
across the street.

05:35.235 --> 05:35.834
Just give it a shot.

05:35.836 --> 05:40.038
I think you'll see
that kid is into some
pretty cool stuff.

05:40.206 --> 05:42.841
(breathing heavily)

05:44.677 --> 05:46.478
Hey, dad,
check it out.

05:46.480 --> 05:48.146
Doesn't it look like
I'm in zero gravity?

05:48.148 --> 05:51.416
Yeah. So, this is
what you do, huh?

05:51.418 --> 05:53.118
Making a sci-fi movie.

05:53.120 --> 05:54.086
Yeah, space stuff.

05:54.088 --> 05:57.823
You ever do
any westerns or
gritty cop dramas?

05:57.825 --> 05:58.924
No, not my genres.

05:58.926 --> 06:01.193
Although, technically,
<i>star wars</i> was a western,

06:01.195 --> 06:03.395
And  <i>robocop</i>
<i>was incredibly dark.</i>

06:03.397 --> 06:05.063
So just space stuff.

06:05.065 --> 06:06.365
Well, you need a hand?
Really?

06:06.367 --> 06:10.836
Yeah, sure.
I'll, um, hold the
camera or something.

06:11.070 --> 06:12.604
Do you want
to act in it?

06:12.606 --> 06:14.239
Do I?

06:14.474 --> 06:15.073
Awesome!

06:15.075 --> 06:17.609
Lie down on the bed,
and whatever happens,
don't move.

06:17.611 --> 06:18.977
Lie down
and don't move.

06:18.979 --> 06:22.781
What do you know,
I've been an actor
my whole life.

06:23.449 --> 06:23.815
Okay.

06:23.817 --> 06:26.385
In a nutshell,
you're caine,
a space miner

06:26.387 --> 06:29.287
Who has an alien egg
gestating in your belly.

06:29.289 --> 06:30.389
I'm who with the what?

06:30.391 --> 06:31.723
Get ready to freak out.

06:31.725 --> 06:32.791
Why would I freak out?

06:32.793 --> 06:34.926
(squirts)
what are you doing?

06:34.928 --> 06:35.927
Why would you do that?

06:35.929 --> 06:36.828
Stop!
(adam growling)

06:36.830 --> 06:38.830
What is that?
Get it out! Stop!

06:38.832 --> 06:39.998
Stop talking.
You're dead.

06:40.000 --> 06:43.268
You ruined my one
good shirt! You're dead!

06:43.270 --> 06:43.735
Ah!

06:43.737 --> 06:46.471
Dad, I told you
there was an alien egg
in your stomach.

06:46.473 --> 06:47.706
What do you
think that means?

06:47.708 --> 06:49.841
You know what?
Let's go back to hockey.

06:49.843 --> 06:50.575
That, I understand.

06:50.577 --> 06:53.645
Adult adam:
<i>While my dad's attempt at</i>
<i>bonding was an utter failure,</i>

06:53.647 --> 06:57.682
<i>My mom was pushing</i>
<i>erica to the next level.</i>

06:58.751 --> 06:59.618
How did I do already?

06:59.620 --> 07:01.887
Okay, just know that
this is a practice test

07:01.889 --> 07:03.422
And we still have
a lot of work to do.

07:03.424 --> 07:06.024
Son of a bitch.
That bad?

07:06.026 --> 07:07.793
1,280.
What?

07:07.795 --> 07:10.028
You better come over
here and hug your mama

07:10.030 --> 07:12.097
Before I punch
you in the face.

07:12.099 --> 07:12.798
Oh, my god!

07:12.800 --> 07:15.367
I thought you were
just talking like
a crazy person

07:15.369 --> 07:16.601
Like you do every other
second of the day.

07:16.603 --> 07:21.039
But you actually
helped me boost my
score by like 100 points!

07:21.041 --> 07:21.773
You're damn right I did.

07:21.775 --> 07:23.508
And that's good enough
to get you into penn.

07:23.510 --> 07:25.377
Forget penn.
That's good enough
for stanford.

07:25.379 --> 07:28.580
Wait, what?
Yeah, I need a
1,300 to get in.

07:28.582 --> 07:30.415
Only 20 more
points to go!

07:30.417 --> 07:32.451
Stanford is
in california.

07:32.453 --> 07:34.286
I know.
It's so far away.

07:34.288 --> 07:39.424
You are not going
to school 20,000 miles
away from me...

07:39.426 --> 07:41.126
Us. The family.

07:41.128 --> 07:41.960
You seriously
won't let me go

07:41.962 --> 07:44.830
To one of the best
colleges in the country?

07:44.832 --> 07:45.964
I...
(gags)

07:45.966 --> 07:46.965
What the hell was that?

07:46.967 --> 07:48.467
I...
(gags, chokes)

07:48.469 --> 07:50.168
Stop.
I...

07:50.170 --> 07:51.636
(gags)
stop doing that.

07:51.638 --> 07:53.805
What are you doing?
(chokes)

07:53.807 --> 07:54.840
I'm sorry.
I can't help it.

07:54.842 --> 07:57.342
It... Stanford's
just so far away. I...

07:57.344 --> 08:00.946
I wouldn't be able
to just pop in on
the weekends, and...

08:00.948 --> 08:03.381
...And hang out with
you and your girlfriends

08:03.383 --> 08:06.117
And try on clothes
and then have you

08:06.119 --> 08:07.285
Take me to the
local college pubs,

08:07.287 --> 08:14.626
Where you introduce
me as your older sister,
barbie, to the cute tas?

08:15.695 --> 08:17.829
That's your plan?
One of them, yeah.

08:17.831 --> 08:22.334
Well, thank god
I learned how to
kick ass on this test.

08:22.935 --> 08:24.736
Thank god.

08:24.837 --> 08:27.239
What have I done?

08:27.340 --> 08:29.040
(chokes)

08:31.077 --> 08:32.410
Well look who it is.

08:32.412 --> 08:35.680
Try not to score on your
own goal, lame gretzky.

08:35.682 --> 08:37.082
Maybe, instead of
being a total putz,

08:37.084 --> 08:38.483
You could
actually help me?

08:38.485 --> 08:40.452
You want my help? Quit.

08:40.454 --> 08:41.620
Quitting isn't
an option.

08:41.622 --> 08:43.722
You know how much
it matters to dad.

08:43.724 --> 08:45.257
I don't want
to let him down.

08:45.259 --> 08:48.159
If I cared at all,
that would make me sad.

08:48.161 --> 08:49.661
Maybe you could
teach me something,

08:49.663 --> 08:51.663
So then, when I look
in the stands,

08:51.665 --> 08:53.131
Dad's not hiding
his face in shame.

08:53.133 --> 08:55.000
What I got
can't be taught.

08:55.002 --> 08:58.003
It's called
natural talent.

08:58.005 --> 08:59.437
See, I'm the
type of player

08:59.439 --> 09:01.439
Who controls the
flow of the game.

09:01.441 --> 09:03.208
You, on the other hand,
are a turd on ice.

09:03.210 --> 09:06.044
I know! But there's
got to be something
I can do.

09:06.046 --> 09:07.412
I guess you could
always be a goon.

09:07.414 --> 09:10.081
A goon?
Like in  <i>the goonies?</i>

09:10.083 --> 09:13.184
A goon! An enforcer.

09:13.186 --> 09:15.387
They protect
the awesome
players like me

09:15.389 --> 09:17.322
Using violence
and dirty play.

09:17.324 --> 09:18.590
As long
as they can kick butt,

09:18.592 --> 09:21.393
A goon doesn't need
to shoot or score.

09:21.395 --> 09:23.528
Teach me.
I am yours to mold.

09:23.530 --> 09:24.829
Please. Teach me
how to be a goonie.

09:24.831 --> 09:28.433
Goon!
Can we just say goonie
if it helps me get there?

09:28.435 --> 09:31.336
Adult adam:
<i>That meant yes,</i>
<i>barry would help me.</i>

09:31.338 --> 09:34.773
<i>All I had to do now</i>
<i>was learn how to fight.</i>

09:35.408 --> 09:38.476
<i>Realizing a good test score</i>
<i>meant losing her daughter,</i>

09:38.478 --> 09:41.279
<i>My mom changed</i>
<i>her tutoring tactics.</i>

09:41.281 --> 09:43.415
Hey, study buddy.

09:43.482 --> 09:44.082
What's all this?

09:44.084 --> 09:45.951
I just wanted some coffee
so I could stay up and study.

09:45.953 --> 09:48.820
Well, you're in luck,
because nothing
keeps your energy up

09:48.822 --> 09:51.256
Like warm milk
and a big pile of turkey.

09:51.258 --> 09:52.757
Don't those things
put you to sleep?

09:52.759 --> 09:54.659
No, no.
The opposite is true.

09:54.661 --> 09:56.728
I read that in a
magazine I threw away.

09:56.730 --> 09:59.464
Well, you got me
this far. I trust you.

09:59.466 --> 10:00.498
Oh, you're sweet.

10:00.500 --> 10:01.900
Oh, listen,
I was thinking,

10:01.902 --> 10:04.269
As a reward for
all your hard work,

10:04.271 --> 10:05.704
You might want
to let off some steam

10:05.706 --> 10:09.240
And go to see
rick springfield
on Friday night.

10:09.242 --> 10:12.377
But that's the night
before the test.

10:12.379 --> 10:13.878
Whoa.

10:14.080 --> 10:16.514
Okay.
Your loss, egghead.

10:16.516 --> 10:18.583
Well, I should probably
get back to work.

10:18.585 --> 10:20.986
Oh, about that,
um, I made up

10:20.988 --> 10:23.888
Some new vocab cards
for you to memorize.

10:23.890 --> 10:25.323
This should get
you the extra points

10:25.325 --> 10:27.392
You need
to get into stanford.

10:27.394 --> 10:28.927
Oh, thanks, mom.

10:28.929 --> 10:30.996
(reading)
"scubulence, noun...

10:30.998 --> 10:35.000
"the process of removing
scuba equipment from a boat?"

10:35.002 --> 10:36.735
(chuckles)
weird word.

10:36.737 --> 10:39.170
Yeah, weird and
real. Just like...

10:39.172 --> 10:41.906
(reading)
"flimjam, verb...

10:41.908 --> 10:45.176
"to run backwards
in a zig-zag pattern."

10:45.178 --> 10:45.910
Got it.

10:45.912 --> 10:47.379
Well, that makes
me feel very...

10:47.381 --> 10:49.381
(reading)
"torkulent, adjective...

10:49.383 --> 10:51.316
"delighted
and a little scared."

10:51.318 --> 10:54.452
Well, let me just
flimjam out of here.

10:54.454 --> 10:58.123
And, uh, good luck
with your studying.

10:59.592 --> 11:05.930
"fidangle, verb...
To finish dangling."

11:06.432 --> 11:08.066
What the hell?

11:14.106 --> 11:16.107
She wouldn't.

11:18.544 --> 11:19.044
She would.

11:19.046 --> 11:21.713
Adult adam:  <i>While</i>
<i>my mom was trying to hurt</i>
<i>erica's chances on the sat,</i>

11:21.715 --> 11:24.749
<i>Barry was teaching me</i>
<i>how to hurt people on the ice.</i>

11:24.751 --> 11:26.885
Okay, ad-rock,
listen up.

11:26.887 --> 11:28.753
There are a few crucial
things you need to learn

11:28.755 --> 11:30.555
In order to
be an enforcer.

11:30.557 --> 11:31.890
I'm ready for this.
Teach me.

11:31.892 --> 11:33.058
We'll start
with the basics.

11:33.060 --> 11:35.994
Lesson one...
This is your stick.

11:35.996 --> 11:38.296
People like me
use it to score.

11:38.298 --> 11:40.832
People like you
use it as a weapon.

11:40.834 --> 11:41.433
Cool. Like a sword.

11:41.435 --> 11:44.669
I can use the moves
I learned in my
stage-combat class.

11:45.404 --> 11:45.870
Ow!

11:45.872 --> 11:47.772
Lesson two...
Every time you say
something like that,

11:47.774 --> 11:50.275
You get a nerd punch in
the meaty part of your arm.

11:50.277 --> 11:52.877
Smart. The pain
will motivate me.

11:52.879 --> 11:54.446
Nerd punch!

11:54.448 --> 11:54.979
Ow!

11:54.981 --> 11:58.249
Lesson three...
Your stick is to
never touch the ice.

11:58.251 --> 12:03.054
It's used for slashing,
hooking, butt-ending,
and spearing.

12:03.056 --> 12:05.724
Any questions?
Aren't all those
penalties?

12:05.726 --> 12:07.425
Nerd punch!
Aah!

12:07.427 --> 12:08.426
Lesson four...
Fighting.

12:08.428 --> 12:10.862
But I didn't learn lessons
one through three yet.

12:10.864 --> 12:13.064
Maybe you did,
maybe you didn't.

12:13.066 --> 12:14.099
I didn't.
Or did you?

12:14.101 --> 12:15.934
I didn't!
Nerd punch!

12:15.936 --> 12:18.303
Now, the trick
to a hockey fight
is the first person

12:18.305 --> 12:20.905
Who sheds their
gloves strikes first.

12:20.907 --> 12:23.074
Go! Again!

12:23.076 --> 12:24.809
Come on,
hurry, hurry, hurry.

12:24.811 --> 12:25.744
Again!

12:25.746 --> 12:27.212
Quick, quick,
quick, quick, quick!

12:27.214 --> 12:30.014
You're gonna lose to
a kid with looser gloves.

12:30.016 --> 12:32.016
Again!
I think I got it now.

12:32.018 --> 12:34.819
You got it
when I say you got it.

12:35.054 --> 12:35.754
Which is now.

12:35.756 --> 12:39.524
Lesson five, and
the most important
lesson of them all...

12:39.526 --> 12:40.258
When you're in a fight,

12:40.260 --> 12:42.527
You grab the bottom
of your opponent's jersey

12:42.529 --> 12:45.163
And yank it over
his head, like so.

12:45.165 --> 12:47.532
Adam: Stop it!
I can't see!

12:47.534 --> 12:50.101
Good.
You're learning.

12:52.738 --> 12:54.038
Lesson six...

12:54.040 --> 12:56.174
Watch out for elbows.

12:56.642 --> 12:58.076
Adam: Ah!

12:58.410 --> 12:59.844
There's my
little genius.

12:59.846 --> 13:02.280
You all geared up for
the big test tomorrow?

13:02.282 --> 13:03.615
All thanks to your help.

13:03.617 --> 13:05.083
You know, I thought
a lot about what you said,

13:05.085 --> 13:08.686
And I decided that penn
is a great choice for me.

13:08.688 --> 13:09.854
Oh, it's happening.

13:09.856 --> 13:11.656
We're going to penn!
I know!

13:11.658 --> 13:14.225
I'm so excited that
I decided to get
a head start

13:14.227 --> 13:16.594
On my essay for
their application.

13:16.596 --> 13:18.196
Here it is.

13:18.697 --> 13:19.864
(reading)
"I believe...

13:19.866 --> 13:22.300
"that the university
of pennsylvania

13:22.302 --> 13:23.401
"is the right
school for me

13:23.403 --> 13:29.874
"because of its
torkulent history and
diligord reputation."

13:29.876 --> 13:32.076
Oh, boy.
Don't stop.
Keep going.

13:32.078 --> 13:33.278
Ah, I'd rather not.

13:33.280 --> 13:35.880
Okay, pops,
would you mind?

13:37.650 --> 13:38.917
(pops reading)
"I feel that I could...

13:38.919 --> 13:41.753
"really benefit from

13:41.755 --> 13:44.255
"cromtormulous student body

13:46.393 --> 13:49.093
Weepeggle?
What the (bleep)

13:49.095 --> 13:50.395
Keep reading.

13:50.397 --> 13:54.532
"I would be bumgubbled

13:54.534 --> 13:56.334

13:56.336 --> 14:01.806
"that even the

14:01.808 --> 14:02.340
Gobulate?

14:02.342 --> 14:04.709
Honest question...
When you wrote this,

14:04.711 --> 14:06.144
Were you smoking
a jazz cigarette?

14:06.146 --> 14:07.812
Oh, it's much
worse than that.

14:07.814 --> 14:10.348
I have a mother
that taught me
fake vocab words

14:10.350 --> 14:13.351
To screw me
out of the college
I want to go to.

14:13.353 --> 14:15.854
What? That's crazy.

14:15.856 --> 14:18.523
That is crazy, right?

14:19.091 --> 14:20.225
I can explain.

14:20.227 --> 14:20.992
Oh, no.

14:20.994 --> 14:24.429
What kind of mother
sabotages her daughter?

14:24.431 --> 14:25.430
Who does that?

14:25.432 --> 14:27.165
Just go to penn.

14:27.167 --> 14:28.333
It's only 20 minutes away.

14:28.335 --> 14:30.134
I can cook for you
and do your laundry

14:30.136 --> 14:33.204
And clean your room because
it's only 20 minutes away,

14:33.206 --> 14:35.607
So you should
live here and commute.

14:35.609 --> 14:36.908
Oh, well,
I've got news for you.

14:36.910 --> 14:38.843
California
ain't far enough away.

14:38.845 --> 14:40.745
I'm going
to japan university.

14:40.747 --> 14:43.348
That's right. Good luck
popping in on me there.

14:43.350 --> 14:44.816
Do you really think
that'll stop me?

14:44.818 --> 14:46.451
I'll fly halfway
around the planet

14:46.453 --> 14:47.719
Just to see you every
weekend if I have to.

14:47.721 --> 14:51.689
Fine! Then I'll
just colonize the moon
and go to college there!

14:51.691 --> 14:53.224
Then I'll get on
a rocket every weekend

14:53.226 --> 14:54.726
Just so I can
give you a hug.

14:54.728 --> 14:56.661
You can't do that!
Oh, I can.

14:56.663 --> 14:59.230
And I will bring you tang
and I'll iron your space suit

14:59.232 --> 15:01.866
And I'll take your alien
roommates to bennigan's!

15:01.868 --> 15:04.569
I hate that you
love me so much!

15:04.571 --> 15:08.373
Adult adam:
<i>While my mom and erica</i>
<i>had taken the gloves off,</i>

15:08.375 --> 15:11.376
<i>I was about to do the same.</i>

15:18.317 --> 15:20.184
(yells)

15:28.127 --> 15:29.994
Nooo!

15:31.597 --> 15:33.331
This wasn't the plan!

15:33.333 --> 15:34.065
Fight back, adam!

15:34.067 --> 15:36.567
Use your stick,
just like I taught you!

15:36.569 --> 15:37.602
You taught him what?

15:37.604 --> 15:40.538
Nothing.
I taught him nothing.

15:40.540 --> 15:42.473
No, no, stop!
I'm the enforcer.

15:42.475 --> 15:44.709
You can't enforce
the enforcer.

15:44.711 --> 15:45.610
Ball up!

15:45.612 --> 15:47.178
Curl into a ball!

15:47.180 --> 15:49.280
Dear god, no!

15:49.282 --> 15:51.516
(buzzer sounds)

15:53.419 --> 15:57.255
Adam! Get back here.
We need to talk.

15:57.257 --> 15:59.390
No.
Just leave me alone.

15:59.392 --> 16:01.326
This is your fault,
you moron.

16:01.328 --> 16:02.160
I'm a moron?

16:02.162 --> 16:04.195
Adam's the one who got
suspended for fighting.

16:04.197 --> 16:06.064
Yeah, you're
the one who taught
him how to fight!

16:06.066 --> 16:07.231
I was trying
to help him.

16:07.233 --> 16:09.233
All he wanted to
do was impress you.

16:09.235 --> 16:11.402
How's it supposed
to impress me

16:11.404 --> 16:12.804
To have him
dragged by the face

16:12.806 --> 16:14.839
And turned into
a human hockey puck?

16:14.841 --> 16:16.307
I don't know.
You won't let him quit,

16:16.309 --> 16:17.909
So what else is
he supposed to do?

16:17.911 --> 16:20.044
Do you know why
I won't let him quit?

16:20.046 --> 16:22.246
You and I
have a ton in common.

16:22.248 --> 16:25.650
We talk about
sports, food, cars.

16:25.652 --> 16:27.251
But adam...
This is all we've got,

16:27.253 --> 16:30.755
And if you take
hockey away,
there's a good chance

16:30.757 --> 16:34.158
That adam and I
might never speak again.

16:34.160 --> 16:36.527
I see what you're saying.

16:36.529 --> 16:37.462
I'm your favorite son.

16:37.464 --> 16:38.730
Didn't say that.
I get it.

16:38.732 --> 16:40.098
No, you don't.
You love me more.

16:40.100 --> 16:41.366
You're an idiot.
You can say
it all you want.

16:41.368 --> 16:44.635
You're an idiot.
But we all know
how you really feel.

16:44.637 --> 16:46.037
You're an idiot.
I get it.

16:46.039 --> 16:47.538
Just stop.
Okay.

16:47.540 --> 16:51.509
Listen, I know
adam's hobbies
are weird to us.

16:51.511 --> 16:52.343
No.
Weird to everyone.

16:52.345 --> 16:56.781
But the kid tried
for five years
to do your thing.

16:56.783 --> 16:58.282
Maybe now it's time
to try his thing

16:58.284 --> 16:59.617
For more
than five minutes.

16:59.619 --> 17:00.918
That's pretty
smart, barry.

17:00.920 --> 17:03.821
Of course!
I'm your favorite.

17:03.823 --> 17:05.623
And back to stupid.

17:08.427 --> 17:11.462
Poopie,
can mama come in?

17:11.964 --> 17:13.731
Let me guess.

17:13.733 --> 17:15.266
You're here
with "directions"

17:15.268 --> 17:17.201
To the new test center
that doesn't exist?

17:17.203 --> 17:20.738
I'm here to apologize.
What I did was wrong.

17:20.740 --> 17:22.140
You know, you always
say you want

17:22.142 --> 17:23.107
What's best
for your children,

17:23.109 --> 17:25.443
But, really, you just
want what's best for you.

17:25.445 --> 17:27.779
Okay, I was selfish.

17:27.781 --> 17:29.781
But... I just
love you so much.

17:29.783 --> 17:30.948
I never want
to let you go.

17:30.950 --> 17:35.253
And you think that
that's supposed to make
what you did any better?

17:35.754 --> 17:36.854
Look...

17:36.856 --> 17:39.524
I know you're gonna go
off to college one day,

17:39.526 --> 17:43.494
But the reality of you
moving all the way
across the country

17:43.496 --> 17:47.298
And starting
a whole new life,
that freaked me out.

17:47.300 --> 17:48.433
But I know
this isn't about me,

17:48.435 --> 17:52.003
So if stanford is what
you want, then, damn it,

17:52.005 --> 17:54.105
We are gonna get
you into stanford.

17:54.107 --> 17:55.573
Do you mean that?
I don't.

17:55.575 --> 17:58.176
Understood.
But I'll work on it.

17:58.310 --> 18:01.345
And maybe in
a year or so...

18:01.347 --> 18:02.880
I will.

18:06.585 --> 18:10.221
You know, um...
I never finished college,

18:10.223 --> 18:11.756
So I could always apply.

18:11.758 --> 18:14.358
Don't ruin the hug.
Okay.

18:16.829 --> 18:18.429
Hey. How you doing?

18:18.431 --> 18:20.364
Well, I discovered
the only thing worse

18:20.366 --> 18:21.399
Than scoring
on your own goal

18:21.401 --> 18:23.668
Is getting scored
into your own goal.

18:23.670 --> 18:26.838
Look, I know you're
not enjoying hockey,

18:26.840 --> 18:30.408
And I'm not enjoying
you not enjoying hockey,

18:30.410 --> 18:31.242
So I thought,
"there has to be

18:31.244 --> 18:32.910
"something else
we can do together."

18:32.912 --> 18:34.378
Please don't make
me play football.

18:34.380 --> 18:36.914
No, no, no. No sports.
Done with sports.

18:36.916 --> 18:39.584
So, I went to the store,
and I got you...

18:39.586 --> 18:41.419
A family-size
bottle of ketchup...

18:41.421 --> 18:46.090
And a three pack
of t-shirts for
you to ruin,

18:46.092 --> 18:48.025
In case you
want to give that

18:48.027 --> 18:49.694
Alien movie
thing another try.

18:49.696 --> 18:52.797
You mean it?
Yeah. Why not?

18:53.999 --> 18:57.401
Well, if we do this,
we do it right.

20:31.064 --> 20:32.530
Okay,
here's the backstory.

20:32.532 --> 20:34.599
You're a space miner
about to explore

20:34.601 --> 20:36.267
An alien vessel
all by yourself.

20:36.269 --> 20:39.337
By myself? An alien vessel?
No, no, no, no.

20:39.339 --> 20:41.606
Let's just send in
a dog or something.
A dog?

20:41.608 --> 20:43.874
We'll give it a flashlight.
Strap a camera on its back.

20:43.876 --> 20:46.510
You're on a solo mission.
There is no dog.

20:46.512 --> 20:49.447
Only a moron would go
on a ship by himself.

20:49.449 --> 20:52.516
Well, you're going in there,
so I guess you're a moron.

20:52.518 --> 20:53.651
How are things
going in here?

20:53.653 --> 20:55.586
He's refusing to go
on the alien ship.

20:55.588 --> 20:58.389
Murray, just go
in the damn ship.

20:58.391 --> 21:00.625
Fine! I will go
in the damn ship.

21:00.627 --> 21:02.994
Good, 'cause now an
alien attacks your face

21:02.996 --> 21:04.528
And implants an egg
inside your belly.

21:04.530 --> 21:07.999
Well, that's exactly
the reason
I didn't want to go in.
