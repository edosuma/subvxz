WEBVTT

00:10.911 --> 00:12.611
ALL RIGHT.
WHERE'S YOUR FATHER?

00:12.613 --> 00:14.029
ARE WE GETTING A SUB?

00:14.030 --> 00:15.446
I DON'T WANT A SUB.
YOU NEVER KNOW
WHERE THEY'VE BEEN.

00:16.717 --> 00:20.185
WILL YOU CALM DOWN?
HE'S ONE MINUTE LATE.
STOP OVERREACTING.

00:20.187 --> 00:21.487
WHAT IF HE
NEVER SHOWS UP?

00:21.489 --> 00:23.355
WHAT IF I NEVER
LEARN ANYTHING ELSE?

00:24.592 --> 00:25.791
I'M GOING DOWN, SIR!

00:25.793 --> 00:26.859
OH, HE'S NOT EVEN HERE.

00:28.529 --> 00:30.195
WE LOST FARKLE.

00:30.197 --> 00:31.630
A LITTLE HELP, MAYA?

00:31.632 --> 00:34.533
MATTHEWS IS OUT,
FARKLE IS DOWN,
IT'S MAYA TIME.

00:35.469 --> 00:37.836
FARKLE'S FIXED.
NO MAYA TIME.

00:37.838 --> 00:40.122
YOU MAY PROCEED.

00:40.123 --> 00:42.407
DURING MAYA TIME, WE OPEN
THE CONFISCATION DRAWER

00:42.410 --> 00:45.244
AND TAKE BACK ALL THE STUFF FROM
THE LAND OF UNFAIRLY TAKEN TOYS.

00:45.246 --> 00:47.713
(scoffs) MAYA! I DON'T THINK
ANYBODY REALLY WANTS--

00:47.715 --> 00:49.748
(all cheering)

00:50.818 --> 00:52.718
ALL RIGHT,
WHOSE IS THIS?

00:52.720 --> 00:54.353
WHAT'D I MISS?

00:56.557 --> 00:58.824
MAYA! HE IS GOING TO
WALK IN AND CATCH YOU

00:58.826 --> 01:01.727
AND YOU'RE GOING TO BE IN
TROUBLE AND I AM HERE TO
KEEP YOU OUT OF TROUBLE,

01:01.729 --> 01:03.962
AND I WILL HAVE FAILED.
DO YOU WANT ME TO FAIL?

01:03.964 --> 01:05.464
DO YOU WANT ME TO SHOW
YOU HOW TO HAVE FUN?

01:05.466 --> 01:06.732
BEHAVING IS FUN.

01:06.734 --> 01:08.901
-COME HERE!
-I REALLY DON'T WANT TO.

01:08.903 --> 01:10.769
YOU COME HERE RIGHT NOW.
RING POWER!

01:10.771 --> 01:13.872
WHEN WE SAY "RING POWER"
YOU HAVE TO. IT'S A RULE.

01:13.874 --> 01:15.541
TELL ME THIS ISN'T FUN.

01:16.577 --> 01:18.444
(laughing)

01:18.446 --> 01:20.779
YEAH, THAT SEEMS LIKE FUN,

01:20.781 --> 01:25.250
BUT NOW YOU DID IT,
SO I DON'T GET TO DO IT,
SO ARE WE SITTING DOWN NOW?

01:25.252 --> 01:27.953
-OF COURSE THERE'S ANOTHER ONE!
-DO IT.

01:27.955 --> 01:29.988
THERE IS NOTHING
IN THIS WORLD THAT
CAN MAKE ME DO IT.

01:29.990 --> 01:31.023
RING POWER.

01:31.025 --> 01:32.291
WHAT'D I MISS?

01:32.293 --> 01:33.625
(yelling)

01:41.368 --> 01:42.868
(students quiet down)

01:43.804 --> 01:45.938
WHEN DID YOU GUYS DECIDE
THERE ARE NO RULES IN HERE?

01:47.408 --> 01:50.943
WHEN DID MY GENEROSITY
IN ALLOWING YOU
TO EXPRESS YOURSELVES

01:50.945 --> 01:54.279
MAKE YOU THINK YOU COULD
TURN MY CLASS INTO A ZOO?

01:54.281 --> 01:55.280
Both: I'M SORRY.

01:55.282 --> 01:57.382
I'M SORRY.

01:58.486 --> 02:00.052
All: I'M SORRY.

02:00.054 --> 02:04.056
LUCAS. WHY ARE YOU THE ONLY ONE
HERE THAT DIDN'T SAY I'M SORRY?

02:04.058 --> 02:06.325
BECAUSE I NEVER DO ANYTHING.

02:06.327 --> 02:08.727
NO. BECAUSE YOU
RESPECT THE RULES.

02:08.729 --> 02:11.997
BECAUSE YOU KNOW WITHOUT THEM,
CIVILIZATION BECOMES CHAOS.

02:13.501 --> 02:16.435
THE REST OF YOU ARE GONNA
SPEND THE AFTERNOON
THINKING ABOUT THAT,

02:16.437 --> 02:18.604
WITH THE EXCEPTION
OF LUCAS THE GOOD.

02:18.606 --> 02:21.306
OH, BOY!
IS THAT GONNA STICK?

02:21.308 --> 02:22.741
I'M ALREADY MAKING T-SHIRTS.

02:24.845 --> 02:26.645
YOU PUT ME IN A REAL
BAD POSITION HERE, SIR.

02:30.885 --> 02:31.917
I GOTTA DO SOMETHING.

02:31.919 --> 02:33.318
YOU CAN FIGHT THIS, LUCAS.

02:33.320 --> 02:35.020
NO, I CAN'T, SIR.
EVERYONE'S LOOKING.

02:35.022 --> 02:37.322
OKAY. DO WHAT
YOU GOTTA DO.

02:41.428 --> 02:42.561
(cell phone bleeps)

02:45.633 --> 02:47.332
-DETENTION.
-OH, THANK YOU, SIR.

02:50.504 --> 02:52.504
-FEEL BETTER, HUCKLEBERRY?
-I'M JUST LIKE YOU NOW.

02:52.506 --> 02:53.805
YEAH, WE'RE EXACTLY THE SAME.

02:55.342 --> 02:57.576
YEAH, YOU'RE ALL THE SAME.

02:57.578 --> 02:58.777
DETENTION, ALL OF YOU!

03:00.014 --> 03:01.881
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

03:01.882 --> 03:03.749
I'M GOING TO BE HOME
LATE TODAY, DADDY.

03:03.751 --> 03:05.350
I KNOW, HONEY.

I'VE ALWAYS ALLOWED
YOU TO BEND THE RULES.

04:06.480 --> 04:09.114
BUT THE BEST OF STUDENTS KNOW
JUST HOW FAR THEY CAN PUSH

04:09.116 --> 04:11.550
BEFORE THOSE RULES ARE BROKEN.

04:11.552 --> 04:13.952
TODAY YOU ARE NOT
THE BEST OF STUDENTS.

04:13.954 --> 04:17.723
BUT YOU KNOW WE'RE GOOD
PEOPLE MOST OF THE TIME,
DON'T YOU, DADDY?

04:17.725 --> 04:20.492
DADDY? YOU'RE MY DADDY.

04:21.762 --> 04:23.595
WHY DO WE NEED RULES AT ALL?

04:23.596 --> 04:25.429
YOU THINK YOU COULD MAKE IT
IN A WORLD WITHOUT RULES?

04:25.432 --> 04:27.099
I THINK I COULD
DO FINE IN ANY WORLD.

04:27.101 --> 04:28.166
THE REST OF YOU BELIEVE THAT?

04:29.870 --> 04:33.572
OKAY. WELL, GUESS WHAT, GUYS.
SCHOOL'S OUT.

04:33.574 --> 04:35.507
YOU'VE GOT THE WHOLE
PLACE TO YOURSELVES.

04:35.509 --> 04:37.643
NO RULES.

04:37.645 --> 04:40.812
ONE HOUR TO BEHAVE
HOWEVER YOU WANT.

04:40.814 --> 04:43.315
LET'S SEE WHAT
BECOMES OF YOU.

04:43.316 --> 04:45.817
WELL, I THINK WE'LL BE PERFECTLY
BEHAVED LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.

04:45.819 --> 04:48.887
AND I THINK WITHIN ONE MINUTE
YOU'LL BE EATING EACH OTHER.

04:51.592 --> 04:53.525
-WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
-I'M LOCKING YOU IN.

04:53.527 --> 04:55.627
THE BEST PUNISHMENT I CAN GIVE

04:55.629 --> 04:58.196
IS TO FORCE YOU TO SPEND
SOME TIME WITH YOURSELVES.

04:58.198 --> 05:00.198
I'LL SEE YOU IN AN HOUR.

05:00.200 --> 05:01.633
WHOEVER'S LEFT.

05:07.574 --> 05:09.741
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.
HE LOCKED US IN.

05:09.743 --> 05:13.645
THAT'S FINE. I DON'T HAVE
A PROBLEM WITH THAT. I'M NOT
CLAUSTROPHOBIC OR ANYTHING.

05:15.916 --> 05:18.750
WE'RE TRAPPED.
(gasping)
I CAN'T BREATHE.

05:18.752 --> 05:21.053
THERE'S MORE
CARBON DIOXIDE
THAN OXYGEN!

05:21.055 --> 05:22.187
THE RATIO IS
ALL WRONG!

05:22.189 --> 05:23.889
OKAY. FARKLE GOTSTA GO.

05:23.891 --> 05:26.725
I GOTSTA?

05:26.727 --> 05:29.728
STOP. THIS IS EXACTLY
WHAT MY FATHER WANTS.

05:29.730 --> 05:32.597
HE WANTS US TO PANIC
AND FALL APART.

05:32.599 --> 05:34.833
WE HAVE TO SHOW HIM THAT
WE CAN GET THROUGH THIS

05:34.835 --> 05:37.569
WITHOUT TURNING INTO
A PACK OF WILD ANIMALS.

05:39.640 --> 05:40.505
I'M HUNGRY.

05:41.809 --> 05:42.874
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT?

05:43.811 --> 05:47.713
NOTHING.
I'M JUST REALLY HUNGRY.

05:48.649 --> 05:49.848
BECAUSE WE'RE BEST FRIENDS.

05:49.850 --> 05:52.250
YEAH, YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE?

05:53.554 --> 05:55.020
I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER
BEEN THIS HUNGRY.

05:55.956 --> 05:58.557
I FEEL YA, RANGER RICK.
I'M KINDA HUNGRY, TOO.

05:58.559 --> 06:00.759
AND IT'S NOT LIKE A REGULAR
KIND OF HUNGRY, RIGHT?

06:00.761 --> 06:03.028
NO. NO. THIS ONE'S DEEP.

06:03.030 --> 06:04.696
IT MUST BE ATTENDED TO.

06:04.698 --> 06:07.566
OH, GUYS, CAN WE JUST SHOW
A LITTLE DISCIPLINE?

06:07.568 --> 06:10.669
I MEAN, HOW MUCH MORE TIME
IN HERE COULD WE POSSIBLY HAVE?

06:14.575 --> 06:16.208
YOU KNOW,
I COULD EAT, TOO.

06:18.712 --> 06:21.012
WHAT? WHAT ARE
YOU LOOKING AT?

06:22.249 --> 06:24.282
GUYS! WHAT ARE YOU
SEEING RIGHT NOW?

06:24.284 --> 06:25.617
STOP TALKING, CHICKEN.

06:27.621 --> 06:31.123
ALL RIGHT, COME ON!
LET'S PROVE MY FATHER WRONG.

06:31.125 --> 06:34.326
LET'S FORM OUR OWN
PERFECT SOCIETY.

06:34.328 --> 06:37.629
RILEYTOWN IS A LAND OF
GOODNESS AND RAINBOWS

06:37.631 --> 06:39.998
WHERE EVERYBODY FOLDS
THEIR HANDS NICELY LIKE SO.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.666
WHO WANTS TO LIVE
IN RILEYTOWN?

06:41.668 --> 06:44.102
NOBODY WANTS RILEYTOWN!
IT'S TOO LOLLIPOP!

06:44.104 --> 06:46.905
YOU'RE LOLLIPOP!

06:46.906 --> 06:49.707
SISTER,
I'M A LOT OF THINGS,
BUT I AIN'T LOLLIPOP.

06:49.710 --> 06:54.713
RILEYTOWN HAS ORDER, STRUCTURE
AND OUR HANDS FOLDED LIKE SO!

06:54.715 --> 06:57.900
WHAT DO YOU GOT?

06:57.901 --> 07:01.086
I GOT MAYAVILLE! NO RULES,
NO LAWS, NO HAND FOLDING
AND NOBODY SAYS NO!

07:02.389 --> 07:03.622
NO.

07:03.624 --> 07:05.757
YOU GOT CHAOS
IS WHAT YOU GOT!

07:05.759 --> 07:07.726
I GOT ORDER, YOU GOT CHAOS!

07:07.728 --> 07:09.928
YOU GOT LOLLIPOP,
I GOT WHOO!

07:09.930 --> 07:13.165
OKAY, DETENTION
MAY BE BRINGING OUT
THE WORST IN US,

07:13.167 --> 07:15.634
BUT AT LEAST WE'RE
MAKING THE TIME PASS.

07:20.207 --> 07:21.239
EAT RILEY!

07:21.241 --> 07:22.707
OKAY. BUT NO BITING.

07:27.314 --> 07:28.647
(knock on door)

07:33.153 --> 07:34.686
OH, YAY, IT'S YOU.

07:34.688 --> 07:37.823
GO EASY ON ME, TOPY.
I'M VULNERABLE TODAY.

07:37.825 --> 07:38.990
AVA? WHAT HAPPENED?

07:38.992 --> 07:40.258
WHAT HAPPENED?

07:42.062 --> 07:43.662
EMMA WEATHERSBEE HAPPENED!

07:44.932 --> 07:47.632
SHE'S MAKIN' INROADS, MAN!

07:47.634 --> 07:50.735
AUGGIE!

07:56.710 --> 08:00.312
(scoffs) AVA, WHATEVER'S
GOING ON, IT'S NOT WORTH
SHOVING YOUR FACE IN THE CAKE.

08:00.314 --> 08:03.949
DUDE, WHY WOULD I DO THAT?
THIS FACE TAKES HOURS.

08:09.690 --> 08:13.225
-JOIN ME?
-NO, I COULDN'T POSSIBLY...

08:13.227 --> 08:17.829
OH! THERE'S ACTUALLY NOT
GONNA BE ANY LEFT, IS THERE?
OKAY, SHOVE OVER.

08:17.831 --> 08:21.766
EMMA WEATHERSBEE DOES
THIS THING I CAN'T EVEN
BEGIN TO COMPETE WITH.

08:21.768 --> 08:23.301
WHAT DOES SHE DO?

08:23.303 --> 08:26.338
(screaming) OH,
IT'S ALL JUST SO OBVIOUS

08:26.340 --> 08:28.840
AND YOUR DOPEY SON
IS FALLING FOR IT.

08:28.842 --> 08:31.510
OKAY, WHAT DOES EMMA DO?

08:31.511 --> 08:34.179
SHE'S NICE. SHE'S POLITE.
SHE SAYS "PLEASE"
AND "THANK YOU"

08:34.181 --> 08:37.883
AND "MAY I" AND...
(screaming)

08:37.885 --> 08:40.352
I DON'T WANT TO LIVE
IN THIS KIND OF WORLD!

08:40.354 --> 08:43.455
(scoffs) OKAY, AVA, WHAT DO
YOU WANT ME TO DO FOR YOU?

08:43.457 --> 08:44.823
COULD YOU MAKE ME LIKABLE?

08:44.825 --> 08:46.424
HONEY, I DON'T SEE HOW.

08:48.161 --> 08:50.795
(sobbing) TOPANGA,
I KNOW HOW I COME ACROSS.

08:51.798 --> 08:55.767
BUT I ALSO KNOW THAT
IF YOU JUST GIVE ME A CHANCE,

08:56.703 --> 09:02.007
DEEP DOWN INSIDE ME,
THERE MAY BE A BEAUTIFUL,
SHINING SOUL.

09:03.010 --> 09:04.242
OH, HONEY!

09:04.244 --> 09:06.278
(loudly)
HOW WAS THAT?

09:07.714 --> 09:10.215
OH, YOU JUST WANT ME
TO HELP YOU BE FAKE NICE?

09:10.217 --> 09:13.118
I AIN'T LOOKIN' FOR MIRACLES.
I JUST WANT YOUR KID BACK.

09:18.792 --> 09:20.759
HERE'S WHAT I KNOW,

09:20.761 --> 09:24.763
DEEP DOWN INSIDE YOU,
IN YOUR BEAUTIFUL,
SHINING SOUL,

09:25.766 --> 09:28.800
YOU ACTUALLY SEE
THE GOOD IN ME.

09:28.802 --> 09:29.834
AW, HONEY.

09:29.836 --> 09:31.970
HOW WAS THAT?

09:37.344 --> 09:40.262
WHY ARE YOU GUYS
OVER THERE?

09:40.263 --> 09:43.181
WHY CAN'T WE JUST BE ONE
HAPPY SOCIETY THAT RUNS
THE WAY I THINK IT SHOULD?

09:43.183 --> 09:44.950
BECAUSE YOU WANT
US ALL TO BE YOU.

09:44.952 --> 09:46.919
WE'RE NOT ALL YOU, RILEY.

09:46.920 --> 09:48.887
I MEAN, YOU KNOW THE REASON
I'VE NEVER BEEN ABLE
TO CHOOSE BETWEEN YOU?

09:48.889 --> 09:50.889
BECAUSE IF IT WAS YOU ALL
THE TIME, LIFE WOULD BE LIKE...

09:50.891 --> 09:54.059
<i>♪ LA, LA, LA, LA,</i>
<i>LA, LA, LA, LA ♪</i>

09:54.061 --> 09:58.330
Both:
<i>♪ LA, LA, LA, LA,</i>
<i>LA, LA, LA, LA ♪</i>

09:58.332 --> 10:00.498
AND IF IT WAS YOU
ALL THE TIME, LIFE
WOULD BE LIKE...

10:00.500 --> 10:02.867
(growling)

10:02.869 --> 10:06.471
<i>DESCENSUS IN CUNICULI CAVUM!</i>

10:06.473 --> 10:07.839
(screaming)

10:07.841 --> 10:10.842
(snarling)

10:11.912 --> 10:13.845
I NEED TO BE
BOTH OF YOU GUYS.

10:13.846 --> 10:15.779
BUT WHO ARE YOU GOING
TO BE WITH RIGHT NOW,
FARKLE?

10:15.782 --> 10:19.884
BEFORE YOU ANSWER THAT, YOU MAY
WANT TO CONSIDER A LITTLE THING
I CALL... THIS.

10:21.054 --> 10:23.121
HE FORGOT TO LOCK
THE BACK DOOR?

10:23.123 --> 10:25.457
MAYA, WE'RE IN DETENTION.
YOU CAN'T LEAVE.

10:25.459 --> 10:28.226
HEY. SCHOOL'S OUT.
HE SAID WE GOT THE
PLACE TO OURSELVES.

10:28.228 --> 10:29.861
HE SAID TO MAKE
OUR OWN RULES.

10:29.863 --> 10:32.163
RULE NUMBER ONE:
SEE YOU AROUND, SUCKERS.

10:34.968 --> 10:37.035
FARKLE?

10:37.036 --> 10:39.103
HEY. WHAT PART OF
"DESCENSUS IN CUNICULI CAVUM"
DO YOU NOT UNDERSTAND?

10:39.106 --> 10:41.256
ALL OF IT.

10:41.257 --> 10:43.407
IT MEANS WE DROP DOWN
INTO THE RABBIT HOLE, MAN.

10:47.481 --> 10:50.382
-LUCAS?
-I NEVER DO ANYTHING, RILEY.

10:54.021 --> 10:56.921
(excitedly) YEAH!

11:08.335 --> 11:12.904
OKAY. WE DON'T NEED THEM.
WE CAN JUST BE IN HERE,
HANDS FOLDED LIKE SO.

11:14.374 --> 11:16.341
SO, WHAT DO YOU GUYS
WANT TO TALK ABOUT?

11:18.445 --> 11:21.012
OH, THAT'S RIGHT.
YOU GUYS DON'T TALK, DO YOU?

11:21.014 --> 11:23.515
WELL, THE FIRST
RULE OF RILEYTOWN

11:23.517 --> 11:26.384
IS THAT EVERYBODY
IN HERE GETS TO TALK.

11:26.386 --> 11:28.520
YOU THERE.
WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO SAY?

11:28.522 --> 11:31.990
HI. MY NAME IS DAVE.

11:31.992 --> 11:34.926
I LIKE CORN CHIPS
AND I'M SORRY I DIDN'T
GO WITH THE OTHER GROUP.

11:36.129 --> 11:38.380
(angrily) DAVE!

11:38.381 --> 11:40.632
I MEAN, DON'T GET US WRONG.
WE REALLY RESPECT
YOU AND EVERYTHING.

11:40.634 --> 11:42.600
-YOU DO?
-WE ALWAYS HAVE.

11:42.602 --> 11:44.936
YOU'RE ONE OF THE GOOD ONES
AND WE'D FOLLOW YOU ANYWHERE.

11:44.938 --> 11:46.738
THANK YOU.

11:46.739 --> 11:48.539
IT'S JUST THAT WITHOUT
THE OTHERS, WE'RE KINDA
BORED OUT OF OUR MINDS.

11:49.609 --> 11:50.875
(angrily) DAVE!

11:51.845 --> 11:55.480
WE'RE SAFE AND SOUND
AND NOT GETTING INTO TROUBLE.

11:55.482 --> 11:58.183
YEAH, BUT THE PROBLEM
WITH THAT IS, ALL THE
GOOD KIDS ARE IN HERE.

11:58.185 --> 12:00.985
WE JUST KNOW THAT
THEY'RE HAVING A LOT
MORE FUN OUT THERE.

12:03.090 --> 12:04.389
WHAT'RE YOU DOING IN HERE?

12:04.391 --> 12:06.391
THEY'RE HAVING A LOT
MORE FUN OUT THERE.

12:07.327 --> 12:09.227
WE'RE IN DETENTION,
JANITOR HARLEY.

12:09.229 --> 12:12.664
HOW 'BOUT THAT.
LITTLE ZIPPY
CROSSED THE LINE.

12:12.666 --> 12:13.965
MAYA INFLUENCED ME.

12:14.935 --> 12:16.468
I'VE NOTICED THAT
OVER THE YEARS.

12:18.238 --> 12:21.506
YOU DO REALIZE
THE BACK DOOR IS WIDE OPEN
DON'T YOU, LITTLE ZIPPY?

12:21.508 --> 12:25.210
WE'RE AWARE.

12:25.211 --> 12:28.913
AND YET THIS GROUP STAYS IN
HERE, WHILE THE OTHER GROUP IS
RAMPAGING DOWN THE HALLWAY.

12:29.683 --> 12:31.683
WELL, WHAT DO YOU
MAKE OF THAT?

12:31.685 --> 12:37.055
I'M SURE WE'LL FIND OUT.
THIS LESSON HAS YOUR FATHER
WRITTEN ALL OVER IT.

12:38.658 --> 12:40.625
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO
LOCK THE FRONT DOOR.

12:40.627 --> 12:43.228
ACTUALLY, I'M NOT.

12:43.230 --> 12:46.097
IT'S TIME TO FIND OUT WHAT
MAYA IS UP TO. GOODBYE.

12:48.101 --> 12:49.684
MAYA WILL BE FINE.

12:49.685 --> 12:51.268
LUCAS AND FARKLE WON'T
LET HER GET INTO TROUBLE.

12:51.271 --> 12:54.139
-SHE'S STRONGER THAN THEM.
-SHE'S BETTER WHEN
YOU'RE WITH HER.

12:54.141 --> 12:59.644
OH, PLEASE. 14 YEARS
OF GOOD INFLUENCE CAN'T
POSSIBLY COME APART IN...

13:03.083 --> 13:04.616
(screaming and ululating)

13:12.692 --> 13:14.959
OKAY, WELL, THIS IS LESS FUN
WHEN THERE'S NO ONE TO CHASE.

13:14.961 --> 13:16.995
EVERYBODY ELSE
IS IN DETENTION.

13:16.997 --> 13:18.963
I'M FINALLY COOL
AND NOBODY NOTICES.

13:18.965 --> 13:20.632
OKAY. OKAY.
WATCH THIS.

13:32.045 --> 13:34.078
HUH! ALSO, OW!

13:35.015 --> 13:37.115
MAYA...

13:37.117 --> 13:39.150
IF THERE'S NO GOOD KIDS
OUT HERE NOTICING US,

13:39.152 --> 13:40.084
THEN, WHAT'S THE POINT?

13:40.921 --> 13:43.288
YOU QUESTIONING
MY LEADERSHIP, HOP-ALONG?

13:43.289 --> 13:45.656
OKAY, THESE NAMES
YOU'RE CALLING ME ARE
KILLING MY STREET CRED.

13:45.659 --> 13:48.092
AW! AND WHAT WOULD YOU
LIKE ME TO CALL YOU?

13:48.094 --> 13:49.561
I'D LIKE YOU TO
CALL ME "MAD DOG."

13:49.563 --> 13:52.096
YOU DON'T SEEM
LIKE A MAD DOG TO ME.

13:52.098 --> 13:54.098
WHAT DO I SEEM
LIKE TO YOU?

13:54.100 --> 13:55.300
YOU KNOW THAT LAMB
THAT MARY HAD?

13:55.302 --> 13:57.035
I DON'T LIKE THE WAY
THAT THIS IS GOING.

13:58.605 --> 14:00.672
I THINK WHAT MAD DOG
IS SAYING IS WHAT GOOD
IS BEING BAD

14:00.674 --> 14:02.807
IF THERE'S NO OTHER
KIND OF PEOPLE AROUND?

14:04.477 --> 14:06.177
(menacingly) I'M BATMAN.

14:07.147 --> 14:08.413
(wheels squealing)

14:11.751 --> 14:13.017
WHO'S THAT?

14:15.255 --> 14:18.122
I AGREE WITH
MAD DOG AND BATMAN.

14:18.124 --> 14:21.159
FOR ME, IT WAS VERY IMPORTANT
FOR US TO BE AMONGST THE GOOD.

14:21.161 --> 14:23.144
WHY?

14:23.145 --> 14:25.128
BECAUSE EVEN BAD KIDS
HAVE GOOD PARTS.

14:25.131 --> 14:28.733
BUT WITHOUT THE GOOD KIDS,
YOU MAY NEVER FIND OUT
WHAT THEY ARE.

14:28.735 --> 14:31.135
YOU TOLD US YOU WERE
ONE OF THE BAD KIDS
WHEN YOU WERE YOUNGER.

14:31.137 --> 14:35.106
WELL, YOU KNOW,
I USED TO INTIMIDATE PEOPLE.
MAKE 'EM SEE THINGS MY WAY.

14:35.108 --> 14:37.141
-DID THEY?
-FOR A WHILE.

14:37.143 --> 14:39.677
-THEN WHAT HAPPENED?
-I MET A GOOD KID.

14:39.679 --> 14:41.679
BUT YOU SEEM LIKE
SUCH A NICE GUY.

14:41.681 --> 14:44.148
IT'S HARD FOR ME
TO BELIEVE YOU EVER
INTIMIDATED ANYTHING.

14:44.150 --> 14:45.049
OH, YEAH?

15:05.205 --> 15:08.373
OKAY. MAYBE HE'S RIGHT.

15:08.375 --> 15:09.574
MAYBE WE NEED
A GOOD KID AROUND.

15:09.576 --> 15:11.075
TO FIND THE GOOD IN US.

15:12.245 --> 15:14.445
YEAH.
LET'S GO STEAL ONE.

15:18.084 --> 15:19.484
DUCK.

15:19.486 --> 15:21.219
DUCK.

15:22.155 --> 15:23.187
DUCK.

15:25.258 --> 15:27.225
SHE'S ACTUALLY TOO NICE
TO MAKE SOMEONE THE GOOSE.

15:27.227 --> 15:29.594
WITHOUT MAYA AROUND,
SHE'S ACTUALLY GETTING WORSE.

15:29.596 --> 15:30.628
DUCK.

15:30.630 --> 15:32.864
(screaming and ululating)

15:32.866 --> 15:33.765
HI.

15:35.302 --> 15:36.267
WAIT!

15:38.571 --> 15:39.470
DUCK!

15:40.740 --> 15:41.739
OKAY!

15:41.741 --> 15:43.808
(continue ululating)

15:51.151 --> 15:52.517
WHY ARE YOU GUYS
LOOKIN' AT ME LIKE THAT?

15:52.519 --> 15:55.486
-HELP US.
-MAKE US MORE LIKE YOU.

16:03.430 --> 16:05.129
OKAY.

16:05.131 --> 16:06.230
YOU GUYS WANT
TO HAVE SOME FUN?

16:13.506 --> 16:15.406
(screaming and ululating)

16:25.919 --> 16:28.419
EVERYBODY CLEAN OFF YOUR FACES,
YOU LOOK RIDICULOUS.

16:30.690 --> 16:31.723
LUCAS,

16:33.226 --> 16:34.292
I'LL GET YOU.

16:35.495 --> 16:37.362
THANK YOU.

16:37.364 --> 16:39.664
YOU KNOW, THEY
CALL ME "MAD DOG".

16:39.666 --> 16:40.798
OF COURSE THEY DO.

16:41.768 --> 16:43.802
WOULD YOU CALL ME
"MAD DOG"?

16:43.803 --> 16:45.837
WOULD YOU CALL ME
"PRINCESS DANCING SUNSHINE"?

16:45.839 --> 16:47.171
NO, I WOULD NOT.

16:47.173 --> 16:48.339
WELL, THERE YOU GO.

16:54.681 --> 16:57.181
I'M HOME!

16:57.183 --> 16:59.817
(groans) WHAT A DAY!

17:01.955 --> 17:04.355
(sweetly)
WE ALL HAVE BAD DAYS,
AUGUST.

17:04.357 --> 17:07.392
PLEASE. I'M SURE
YOU DID YOUR BEST.

17:07.394 --> 17:09.260
THANK YOU. MAY I?

17:10.897 --> 17:11.896
WHAT THE--

17:12.799 --> 17:14.632
I TOLD YOU I DIDN'T
THINK I COULD DO THIS.

17:14.634 --> 17:16.334
WHAT DID YOU DO TO HER?

17:16.336 --> 17:18.202
HONEY, SHE ASKED ME TO!

17:18.204 --> 17:22.306
(softly) I WOULD CHANGE
MYSELF COMPLETELY

17:22.308 --> 17:24.642
IF IT MEANT
NOT LOSING YOU

17:24.644 --> 17:27.412
TO MISS EMMA WEATHERSBEE.

17:27.414 --> 17:29.580
AVA. YOU'RE NOT EMMA.

17:29.582 --> 17:32.483
BE AVA.
I DON'T WANT TWO EMMAS.

17:32.485 --> 17:34.485
I CAN'T STAND BEING
POLITE ALL DAY.

17:34.487 --> 17:36.220
-YOU CAN'T?
-NO.

17:36.222 --> 17:38.289
IT MAKES ME WANT TO DRAW
WITH A BLACK CRAYON.

17:38.291 --> 17:39.690
YOU WANT TWO AVAS?

17:39.692 --> 17:40.758
Both: NO!

17:42.562 --> 17:44.228
"PLEASE" AND "THANK YOU"
ARE ALL RIGHT,

17:44.230 --> 17:47.365
BUT SOMETIMES A GUY'S GOTTA
HEAR "GIVE ME" AND "I WANT!"

17:47.367 --> 17:51.669
WELL, I WANT TO TAKE OFF
THIS STUPID HAT! AND I WANT
TO TAKE OFF THIS STUPID DRESS!

17:51.671 --> 17:54.405
AND I WANT CHEESE! GIVE ME!

17:54.407 --> 17:56.007
AVA, WE'RE HAVING
TEA RIGHT NOW.

17:56.009 --> 17:57.708
LET ME TELL YOU WHAT
I THINK ABOUT TEA--

17:57.710 --> 17:59.544
NO! I WILL GET
YOU SOME CHEESE.

18:01.414 --> 18:02.547
TOPANGA...

18:02.549 --> 18:04.816
-YES?
-THANK YOU.

18:06.019 --> 18:08.252
WOW, AVA.

18:08.254 --> 18:14.325
YOU KNOW, INSIDE OF THERE,
THERE REALLY IS A SWEET
LITTLE GIRL AFTER ALL.

18:16.262 --> 18:17.295
AW, TOPY--

18:17.297 --> 18:18.930
(loudly)
HOW WAS THAT?

18:19.899 --> 18:21.532
(sighs) PRETTY GOOD.

18:26.506 --> 18:29.707
(chanting)

18:39.652 --> 18:41.302
YOU HAVE FUN?

18:41.303 --> 18:42.953
I DID. IT WAS QUITE
ENJOYABLE. AND YOU?

18:42.956 --> 18:45.756
SOMEONE HAD THE IDEA
TO PUT ME IN A BAG.

18:45.758 --> 18:48.359
-DID YOU HEAR ABOUT THAT?
-REALLY?

18:48.361 --> 18:50.461
WELL, YOU KNOW, THERE'S
SOME BAD KIDS OUT THERE.

18:52.298 --> 18:53.831
OKAY, GUYS. DETENTION OVER.

18:53.833 --> 18:55.466
-DAD.
-YEAH?

18:55.468 --> 18:58.302
REMEMBER HOW YOU TOLD US
THAT PEOPLE CHANGE PEOPLE?

18:58.304 --> 19:00.988
SECRET OF LIFE.

19:00.989 --> 19:03.673
WELL, WHEN YOU'RE NOT WITH
THOSE PEOPLE, HOW DO YOU
KEEP FROM CHANGING BACK?

19:03.676 --> 19:04.909
YOU WENT A LITTLE
WILD, DID YOU?

19:04.911 --> 19:06.911
WHATEVER I GOT IS STRONG
IN ME, MATTHEWS.

19:07.947 --> 19:11.382
YEAH, ME, TOO,
BUT THE OTHER WAY.

19:11.384 --> 19:13.518
-HARLEY!
-RIGHT HERE.

19:15.955 --> 19:17.822
-YOU WATCHED THEM?
-LIKE A HAWK.

19:18.925 --> 19:19.991
-WAIT!
-YOU'RE WITH HIM?

19:19.993 --> 19:22.059
YEAH. HE'S MY GOOD KID.

19:22.996 --> 19:24.395
WHAT DO YOU GOT?

19:24.397 --> 19:27.331
EVERYONE WENT NUTS,
EXCEPT FOR ZIPPY.

19:27.333 --> 19:28.699
WHY DIDN'T YOU
GO NUTS, ZIPPY?

19:29.769 --> 19:32.637
I WAS WITHOUT MAYA.

19:32.638 --> 19:35.506
WITHOUT MAYA, I DON'T THINK
I'D EVER UNFOLD MY HANDS.

19:35.508 --> 19:37.441
WHAT ABOUT THIS ONE HERE?

19:37.443 --> 19:38.809
MAYA WAS THE RINGLEADER.

19:38.811 --> 19:40.611
MAYA WAS THE FIRST
ONE OUT THE DOOR.

19:40.613 --> 19:42.880
I WAS WITHOUT RILEY.

19:42.882 --> 19:45.116
WITHOUT RILEY,
I MAY NEVER COME BACK.

19:45.118 --> 19:46.951
OKAY.

19:46.953 --> 19:49.754
WELL, DETENTION OVER, GUYS.
EVERYONE OUT. EXCEPT MAYA.

19:51.024 --> 19:52.456
-DAD--
-EVERYONE OUT.

19:57.530 --> 20:00.965
SO, YOU WERE LIKE ME.
WHAT CHANGED YOU?

20:00.967 --> 20:04.769
WELL, IT TURNS OUT
THERE IS ALWAYS TWO DOORS.

20:04.771 --> 20:06.003
HE SHOWED ME THE OTHER ONE.

20:08.074 --> 20:10.141
IT'S GOOD TO KNOW
THERE'S SOMEONE
LIKE THAT AROUND.

20:13.813 --> 20:15.413
OKAY, SO...

20:15.415 --> 20:17.982
HOW LONG DID IT TAKE FOR
YOU TO GO FULL-BLOWN MAYA?

20:17.984 --> 20:21.052
-FIVE MINUTES.
-FIVE MINUTES. THAT'S FOUR
MINUTES BETTER THAN LAST TIME.

20:22.388 --> 20:23.621
SO, YOU WEREN'T
THERE THIS MORNING?

20:23.623 --> 20:25.656
YEAH, THE SUBWAY WAS
LATE OR SOMETHING...

20:25.658 --> 20:27.892
OR SOMETHING.

20:27.893 --> 20:30.127
YOU KNOW, MAYA, IT'S A GOOD
THING TO KNOW, I DON'T ALWAYS
HAVE TO BE IN THIS ROOM

20:30.129 --> 20:32.363
TO GIVE MY STUDENTS A TEST.

20:32.364 --> 20:34.598
AND IT'S A GOOD THING WE GOT
PEOPLE WHO CHECK UP ON US
EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE.

20:35.668 --> 20:37.401
YEAH.

20:37.403 --> 20:39.570
OKAY. SO, WHAT'S NEXT?

20:40.807 --> 20:42.607
I SIT HERE ANOTHER HOUR.

20:42.609 --> 20:46.477
MAYA, WHATEVER YOU
END UP DECIDING TO BE,

20:46.479 --> 20:50.414
THE BEST THING I CAN TEACH YOU
RIGHT NOW IS THAT THERE ARE
CONSEQUENCES TO OUR ACTIONS.

20:51.718 --> 20:53.150
THE RULES ARE THERE TO HELP US.

20:54.554 --> 20:55.453
I'LL TRY HARDER NEXT TIME.

20:55.455 --> 20:56.621
I KNOW.

21:01.494 --> 21:03.561
-HEY, MATTHEWS.
-YEAH?

21:04.430 --> 21:06.998
NEXT TIME I'M GONNA PUT
SOME WAR PAINT ON RILEY'S FACE.

21:07.000 --> 21:10.067
YEAH. I'M SURE
SHE'S COUNTING ON IT.

21:31.557 --> 21:32.623
RILEY!

21:33.760 --> 21:34.825
RIGHT HERE.

21:45.471 --> 21:46.937
THANKS FOR COMING OVER, AVA.

21:46.939 --> 21:48.506
I HAD A REAL GOOD TIME.

21:48.508 --> 21:49.874
ME TOO, AUGGIE.

21:49.876 --> 21:53.511
TOMORROW, I WANT
TO TALK ABOUT ME MORE

21:53.513 --> 21:57.114
AND I WANT TO WATCH
MY TV SHOWS AND I WANT
TO TALK ABOUT ME MORE.

21:58.618 --> 21:59.550
SOUNDS GOOD.
SEE YOU TOMORROW.

21:59.552 --> 22:01.752
-TOPANGA!
-YES!

22:01.754 --> 22:03.037
THROW ME OUT!

22:03.038 --> 22:04.321
(gasps) I HAD THE SAME IDEA.

22:04.324 --> 22:06.824
Both: Whee!

22:09.629 --> 22:12.163
-THANK YOU!
-MY PLEASURE.

22:12.165 --> 22:13.831
I NEVER THOUGHT
I'D SAY THIS,

22:13.832 --> 22:15.498
BUT SHE IS REALLY
STARTING TO GROW ON ME.

22:15.501 --> 22:20.271
REALLY? BECAUSE I DECIDED THAT
IF YOU STILL DIDN'T LIKE HER

22:20.273 --> 22:22.573
I WAS NEVER GOING
TO SEE HER AGAIN,

22:22.575 --> 22:26.811
BECAUSE YOUR HAPPINESS IS MORE
IMPORTANT THAN ANYTHING TO ME.

22:26.813 --> 22:28.579
AW, HONEY--

22:28.581 --> 22:29.747
HOW WAS THAT?
