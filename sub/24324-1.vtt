00:53.620 --> 00:56.623
Nice titties.
- Knock it off!

00:56.773 --> 00:58.475
Maurice, not now.

00:58.625 --> 01:01.361
It was a compliment.
- How much longer?

01:01.511 --> 01:02.445
Soon, sweetie.
- Mom?

01:02.595 --> 01:05.406
Quiet.
- I just want to ask a question.

01:05.556 --> 01:08.088
Why does Luke have
such nice titties?

01:08.238 --> 01:10.620
I said knock it off.
Enough.

01:10.770 --> 01:13.640
Playful teasing
builds character.

01:13.790 --> 01:15.208
Luke needs that.

01:20.080 --> 01:22.382
Anything?!

01:29.622 --> 01:33.326
Doctors Ben Morin
and Catherine O'Neal

01:33.476 --> 01:35.512
were on a scientific journey,

01:35.662 --> 01:38.731
which began long before
they were even born.

01:39.799 --> 01:42.769
Ah!
Hey!

01:43.803 --> 01:47.490
Catherine O'Neal
was the only child

01:47.640 --> 01:50.968
of two prominent physicists
who died tragically

01:51.118 --> 01:54.447
in a helium explosion
when she was 12 years old.

01:55.448 --> 02:00.003
She was raised
by her aunt Libby,

02:00.153 --> 02:04.040
a prominent psychologist
and... beer aficionado.

02:04.190 --> 02:08.193
I think we owe them and we owe
ourselves a better country than that.

02:08.344 --> 02:12.048
Ben Morin came from a
long line of scientists,

02:12.198 --> 02:15.902
every single one more
successful than the last.

02:16.052 --> 02:18.671
But as a child,
Ben had no affinity

02:18.821 --> 02:20.773
for science.

02:24.210 --> 02:26.129
He spent most
Saturday mornings

02:26.279 --> 02:29.582
playing point guard
with the neighbourhood kids.

02:29.732 --> 02:31.434
You okay, son?

02:31.584 --> 02:33.286
Yeah, I'm fine.

02:35.555 --> 02:37.665
Sport isn't your calling, son.

02:37.815 --> 02:39.776
But I almost had
the rebound.

02:39.926 --> 02:42.929
You're a scientist through and through.
It's in your genes.

02:43.930 --> 02:46.866
Now, come on, let's get some ice
on that noggin.

02:47.016 --> 02:48.752
I'm okay to play.

02:48.902 --> 02:51.504
You are better than this.

02:59.679 --> 03:01.431
Ben never played
basketball again.

03:01.581 --> 03:05.201
I'm not gonna tell you twice
now! Come on.

03:05.351 --> 03:08.521
And took his rightful place
in the family tree.

03:08.671 --> 03:10.273
He focused on his schoolwork

03:10.423 --> 03:12.934
and developed
a sharp scientific mind

03:13.084 --> 03:15.445
and a healthy appetite
for success.

03:15.595 --> 03:19.524
For years, his sex life
consisted of masturbating

03:19.674 --> 03:23.603
to women's equestrian riding
on Sunday afternoons.

03:27.574 --> 03:29.626
But he finally
found true love

03:29.776 --> 03:34.164
when he met fellow PhD
student Catherine O'Neal.

03:34.314 --> 03:39.219
They devoted their careers to proving the
ultimate power of nurture over nature

03:39.369 --> 03:41.304
to finally answer
the timeless question:

03:41.454 --> 03:46.242
Could we have been anyone
other than who we are?

03:46.392 --> 03:49.963
Maybe he needs some fluids, I don't know. What do you think?
- Yeah.

03:55.668 --> 03:59.005
They enjoyed the prestige of
being university professors,

03:59.155 --> 04:03.810
but were about to redefine
their measure of success.

04:03.960 --> 04:06.279
For decades,
my foundation has invested

04:06.429 --> 04:08.598
in scientific endeavour
of all kind.

04:08.748 --> 04:12.527
And the one common thread I find
with all scientists

04:12.677 --> 04:16.456
is the fundamental belief
that they can contribute

04:16.606 --> 04:18.391
to the advancement
of humankind.

04:18.541 --> 04:19.809
A noble conviction.

04:19.959 --> 04:24.697
But most of us, myself included,
make very safe choices.

04:24.847 --> 04:27.900
Yet aren't we always inspired
by the rebels?

04:28.835 --> 04:31.187
The ones who lay it all
on the line?

04:31.337 --> 04:35.575
The ones throughout history who dared
to believe that the earth wasn't flat.

04:36.676 --> 04:40.680
The Darwins, the Einsteins
who were considered crazy

04:40.830 --> 04:43.750
we now know
to be visionaries.

04:45.685 --> 04:48.755
These minds only come around
every couple of generations,

04:48.905 --> 04:51.374
so it's important
for all scientists to believe

04:51.524 --> 04:55.361
that they possess the ability
to be one of the greats.

04:55.511 --> 04:57.480
To be one of the rebels.

04:57.630 --> 05:02.402
As scientists, it is your duty to teach
us to see the world a different way,

05:02.552 --> 05:04.971
and to hopefully make our world
a better place.

05:06.539 --> 05:10.443
And so, if you feel that you're
one of those revolutionary minds

05:10.593 --> 05:12.295
that can think outside the box,

05:12.445 --> 05:14.464
I am standing
in front of you today

05:14.614 --> 05:17.483
to ask you to think
outside of that box too.

05:17.633 --> 05:19.085
Thank you.

05:27.026 --> 05:29.812
Randolph P. Gertz III

05:29.962 --> 05:33.950
was the great-grandson
of Archibald Gertz,

05:34.100 --> 05:39.839
who built an empire exporting linen
from Belfast in the 19th century.

05:39.989 --> 05:43.910
Despite a strict Catholic
upbringing by his mother,

05:44.060 --> 05:47.380
Gertz was lured
by the family fortune

05:47.530 --> 05:50.116
and enjoyed
every penny of it.

05:50.266 --> 05:52.602
After his father's death,

05:52.752 --> 05:56.797
Gertz challenged himself
to take charge of his life

05:56.947 --> 06:00.993
and created the Gertz
Foundation for the Sciences.

06:02.061 --> 06:04.380
After years
of... debatable success,

06:04.530 --> 06:08.134
he remained determined
to prove to the world

06:08.284 --> 06:10.670
he wasn't a papa's boy.

06:13.072 --> 06:15.433
Are they here?

06:15.583 --> 06:17.794
Yes.

06:17.944 --> 06:21.514
I think we might have
ourselves a winner.

06:31.791 --> 06:33.743
Thanks for coming.
- Thanks for having us.

06:33.893 --> 06:36.629
You've met my personal
assistant, Ms. Phyllis Tridek.

06:36.779 --> 06:37.947
We did.
- I'll be right back.

06:38.097 --> 06:41.067
I gotta tell you,
of all the proposals I read,

06:41.217 --> 06:42.902
yours really knocked
my socks off.

06:44.637 --> 06:46.831
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

06:46.981 --> 06:49.025
Come. Let's hit the boudoir.

06:49.175 --> 06:52.428
In 1920,
at Johns Hopkins University,

06:52.578 --> 06:56.590
a Professor named John Watson
wanted to prove

06:56.740 --> 07:00.206
that all emotions and behaviours
are learned.

07:00.356 --> 07:03.582
So he had a baby,
known as Little Albert,

07:03.732 --> 07:06.959
play with a white rat,
which the kid loved.

07:07.109 --> 07:09.779
But Watson started
making a loud noise

07:09.929 --> 07:13.132
every time the kid touched the rat,
and, eventually,

07:13.282 --> 07:16.051
the baby became afraid
of the rat,

07:16.201 --> 07:18.821
even when he didn't make
the noise.

07:18.971 --> 07:22.675
Watson successfully taught
the child to fear rats.

07:22.825 --> 07:24.410
Conditioning 101.
Hmm.

07:24.560 --> 07:25.995
Essentially, uh, well,

07:26.145 --> 07:28.539
Pavlov and the dog.
Hmm.

07:28.689 --> 07:30.933
With your help, we believe

07:31.083 --> 07:34.804
we could actually prove this
on a much larger scale.

07:34.954 --> 07:38.524
And unlike Watson,
we'd foster positive behaviours, not fear.

07:38.674 --> 07:40.543
Our idea is very simple:

07:40.693 --> 07:44.614
We want to raise
our soon-to-be-born child,

07:44.764 --> 07:48.000
and two other kids,
contrarily to their genetics.

07:48.150 --> 07:50.620
Yeah, so...
so with your support,

07:50.770 --> 07:52.880
we would very much like
to adopt Maya.

07:53.030 --> 07:54.991
She's just been put up
for adoption

07:55.141 --> 07:58.177
and comes from a long line
of dim-witted individuals.

07:58.327 --> 08:02.048
Hmm.
- Her parents were... simple people.

08:02.198 --> 08:03.950
Hmm.
- Very simple.

08:04.984 --> 08:06.736
Idiots?
- Yes. Idiots.

08:06.886 --> 08:09.889
But we would nurture the smartest
little girl you've ever seen.

08:10.039 --> 08:12.642
Oh, she'll be smart as a whip.
- Ka-tch!

08:12.792 --> 08:15.595
And obviously, with your generous support,
we would adopt,

08:15.745 --> 08:17.714
uh... Maurice.

08:17.864 --> 08:19.916
Now, his ancestors were, uh...

08:20.066 --> 08:24.036
angry, aggressive...
and in some cases...

08:24.186 --> 08:25.388
Violent.

08:25.538 --> 08:27.423
Pretty violent, actually.
- Yeah.

08:27.573 --> 08:31.644
But we would...
we'd raise him to be a pacifist.

08:31.794 --> 08:34.679
Like Gandhi?
- Yeah, like the Mahatma.

08:34.830 --> 08:36.399
Hmm.
- And as you can see,

08:36.549 --> 08:40.186
Catherine is very pregnant.
- I should pop any day, really.

08:40.336 --> 08:44.107
And we would raise our son
to be... an artist.

08:44.256 --> 08:48.094
So the son of two scientists
is gonna be raised as an artist.

08:48.244 --> 08:49.946
Bingo.

08:50.096 --> 08:52.198
Thus proving
the power of nurture.

08:52.348 --> 08:53.783
Double bingo.

08:53.933 --> 08:56.702
And you have no ethical
concerns about this?

08:56.852 --> 08:58.454
No. Why should we?

08:58.604 --> 09:01.391
I mean, it's no different
to most parents who, you know,

09:01.541 --> 09:04.677
encourage their kids to play piano
or be doctors or super athletes.

09:04.827 --> 09:06.629
Yeah.
- And at the end of the day,

09:06.779 --> 09:10.157
what matters most is how much
you love your kids, right?

09:10.307 --> 09:13.686
And we're gonna give our kids
every ounce of love we got.

09:14.787 --> 09:17.440
And... and more importantly,
we will prove

09:17.590 --> 09:20.593
that everyone has the potential
to become anything.

09:20.743 --> 09:22.945
Any... I mean, anything.
- No one... Yeah.

09:23.095 --> 09:27.266
No one is a prisoner of their
genetic heritage. No way.

09:27.416 --> 09:29.802
And you believe
you can pull this off?

09:29.952 --> 09:32.004
Indubitably.
- Absolutely.

09:32.154 --> 09:34.206
Well, if that's the case...

09:35.942 --> 09:37.660
...let's start
changing the world.

pathways and cerebral juices.

14:26.081 --> 14:27.483
Hey, be polite.

14:27.633 --> 14:30.536
Who punched you in the nose?
- Come on, let's shake a leg.

14:30.686 --> 14:32.388
And what is your answer?

14:32.538 --> 14:35.407
The Anglo-Zanzibar War
of 1895?

14:35.557 --> 14:37.209
Uh... I mean 6.

14:37.359 --> 14:38.761
1896.

14:38.911 --> 14:40.613
Write it down, Maya.

14:42.248 --> 14:44.333
This time,

14:44.483 --> 14:48.020
we'll be conducting a test called the
Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children.

14:48.170 --> 14:51.056
Is it hard?
- No harder than usual, sweetie.

14:51.206 --> 14:52.775
Just do your best.

14:52.925 --> 14:54.944
Jack has $56 for the market.

14:55.094 --> 14:58.272
By the end of the day,
he has used $19.

14:58.422 --> 15:01.600
What percentage of his money
has he spent?

15:01.750 --> 15:05.437
Three, two, one... Go.

15:09.942 --> 15:11.944
A-about a third.

15:12.094 --> 15:13.462
34%.

15:13.612 --> 15:17.516
You don't need to say it,
sweetie. Just write it down.

15:19.318 --> 15:23.055
Question #7: On a scale of one to 10...
- Get them in here, please.

15:23.205 --> 15:25.557
One "not angry at all
and 10 being "furious",

15:25.707 --> 15:27.276
how would you react
if you overheard

15:27.426 --> 15:30.529
your brother or sister
saying bad things about you?

15:30.679 --> 15:32.347
One. Not angry at all.

15:32.497 --> 15:34.016
You wouldn't be mad?

15:34.166 --> 15:37.269
"Anger always ends in shame."
Ben Franklin said that.

15:37.419 --> 15:39.188
Do you agree
with Mr. Franklin?

15:39.338 --> 15:43.475
Of course. Maya would never say
anything bad about me, anyway.

15:43.625 --> 15:45.927
And my brother's a fag,

15:46.077 --> 15:48.380
so, yeah... definitely one.

15:49.615 --> 15:52.952
(manOkay, one last series.
Um...

15:53.102 --> 15:55.237
summer.
- Uh, winter.

15:55.387 --> 15:58.123
Think as creatively
as you can.

15:58.273 --> 15:59.791
Dog.

15:59.941 --> 16:01.310
Cat?

16:01.460 --> 16:04.496
Clown.
- Listen. - Party.

16:04.646 --> 16:06.348
Vagina.
- Penis.

16:06.498 --> 16:10.069
Relationship.
- Uh... breakup.

16:10.219 --> 16:12.338
Breathe.
- Suck.

16:12.488 --> 16:14.273
Excrement.

16:14.423 --> 16:16.208
Shit.
- Slow.

16:16.358 --> 16:18.110
Stupid.

16:19.078 --> 16:22.031
Play.
- Theatre?

16:22.181 --> 16:25.025
Dragon.
- Animal.

16:25.175 --> 16:27.870
Water.
- So...

16:28.020 --> 16:30.039
what is going on here?

16:30.189 --> 16:33.225
What do you mean?
- I'm not seeing superstars.

16:33.375 --> 16:35.210
They're hesitant,
they're docile,

16:35.360 --> 16:37.604
they're... average.
- Average?!

16:37.754 --> 16:39.849
It means the opposite
of superstar.

16:39.999 --> 16:44.103
With all due respect,
things are looking pretty positive.

16:44.253 --> 16:46.438
We're not looking for "pretty positive",
Catherine.

16:46.588 --> 16:48.840
I tell you all the time,
so I'll tell you again:

16:48.990 --> 16:51.309
Now, these results
need to be rock-hard solid.

16:51.459 --> 16:53.779
The study needs to be
like a slap in the face.

16:53.929 --> 16:55.197
Our results
are rock-hard solid.

16:55.347 --> 16:57.424
We're gonna be, uh,
slapping a lot of faces.

16:57.574 --> 16:59.906
We're deep
into the last year here, people.

17:00.056 --> 17:02.388
There's no room for complacency.
Capisce?

17:02.538 --> 17:04.106
We capisce.

17:04.256 --> 17:05.974
Totally capisce.

17:06.125 --> 17:08.544
And may I remind you
that our deal clearly states

17:08.694 --> 17:13.198
that if this fails or blows up in your face,
you pay me back every penny.

17:13.348 --> 17:14.950
Well, we're not failing.

17:15.099 --> 17:16.551
Well, I'm no Randy Warhol,

17:16.702 --> 17:19.405
but answering "cat"
when the question is "dog"

17:19.555 --> 17:21.707
is not a sign
of artistic genius.

17:21.857 --> 17:24.108
He was being ironic.

17:24.259 --> 17:25.426
Oh.

17:25.577 --> 17:28.079
Did he learn that
from his mother, do you think?

17:28.230 --> 17:30.082
I don't doubt it.

17:30.232 --> 17:31.934
Hmm.

17:32.084 --> 17:33.786
Neither do I.

17:36.255 --> 17:40.726
Cut the Little House on the Prairie
routine and get your shit together.

17:40.876 --> 17:42.795
Okay. Drive safe.

17:48.434 --> 17:50.602
Who wants a warm bowl
of bisque?

17:50.752 --> 17:52.554
That sounds lovely.

17:52.704 --> 17:54.506
You guys go ahead.

18:06.285 --> 18:08.821
Just saw Tweedledum
and Tweedledee.

18:09.755 --> 18:12.357
We need a powwow ASAP.

18:13.292 --> 18:14.977
Everything okay?

18:15.127 --> 18:17.763
Call Kukiku.
I need a goddamn rub.

18:22.134 --> 18:25.137
Yeah, it's me. He needs a rub.

18:33.779 --> 18:37.716
Gertz came to visit twice a year,
like clockwork.

18:38.750 --> 18:41.403
It was usually
a cheerful formality

18:41.553 --> 18:45.282
that ended
with too many vodka martinis.

18:45.432 --> 18:49.161
But today, Ben and Catherine
felt no cheer.

18:49.311 --> 18:50.646
No cheer at all.

18:50.796 --> 18:54.516
Ow! Ow! That hurts!

18:54.666 --> 18:57.619
Oh, it hurts?
Ah!

18:57.769 --> 19:00.539
Swing it harder!
Put your whole weight behind it.

19:00.689 --> 19:02.407
Oh!

19:03.442 --> 19:07.246
Bend over, bend over!
Three and a-two,

19:07.396 --> 19:09.414
and a-one and a...
- Ow!

19:10.883 --> 19:14.203
I want to go again!
I want to go again!

19:14.353 --> 19:17.189
Ow. Good one.
- Turn around, turn... - Alright, fine.

19:19.491 --> 19:22.828
Hey! You stop that!
What are you doing?!

19:22.978 --> 19:24.680
Nothing.
- It's just a game.

19:24.830 --> 19:27.699
You're hurting yourselves!
- That's the point.

19:27.849 --> 19:29.501
Oh, to hurt yourselves?

19:31.603 --> 19:34.490
Sammy, just give it a minute,
please.

19:34.640 --> 19:38.443
Mom, it's just a game. Relax.
- It's totally cool.

19:38.593 --> 19:41.196
No, not cool! Now...

19:41.346 --> 19:43.707
go to your rooms.

19:43.857 --> 19:46.218
This is bullshit!

19:46.368 --> 19:48.921
Rooms! Now!

19:49.855 --> 19:51.623
Not you.

19:52.658 --> 19:54.401
Sammy.

19:54.551 --> 19:56.145
Yes.

19:56.295 --> 19:59.298
I need some anger-discharge
training here, please.

19:59.448 --> 20:01.366
Right away.
Oh, yes.

20:01.516 --> 20:03.285
I know what to do.

20:03.435 --> 20:05.804
Here we go again,
little pitbull.

20:06.872 --> 20:10.642
Time to fix you. Come.
This is your lucky day.

20:11.743 --> 20:14.846
Do you feel the serotonin
flowing through your veins?

20:14.996 --> 20:17.416
Not really.
- You will, you will.

20:17.566 --> 20:19.534
Okay. Very nice.

20:19.684 --> 20:21.653
Two more minutes.

20:31.763 --> 20:33.565
Kids are asleep.

20:35.434 --> 20:37.703
What do we do?
- What?

20:37.853 --> 20:39.288
What do we do?

20:39.438 --> 20:42.082
About Gertz?
- Yeah, Gertz.

20:42.232 --> 20:44.797
What can we do?
- Well...

20:44.947 --> 20:47.362
we have to do something.

20:47.512 --> 20:50.073
Well, I'm more concerned
about the slapping.

20:50.223 --> 20:52.634
The... the paddle thing?
- Yeah. It was weird.

20:52.784 --> 20:56.755
Meh... kids. That's what kids do.
They horse around.

20:56.905 --> 20:58.673
Still, it's... it's weird.

20:58.823 --> 21:00.592
Well, Gertz is weirder.

21:02.261 --> 21:05.764
But he's right, you know.
We can't afford to be complacent.

21:05.914 --> 21:08.634
Ugh, God, I really need
to integrate flossing

21:08.784 --> 21:10.936
more regularly
in my daily routine.

21:11.086 --> 21:12.938
Can you remind me, Cath?

21:22.514 --> 21:25.617
Theatre... is an act of war.

21:32.491 --> 21:36.061
Let the play speak for itself.

21:41.867 --> 21:45.529
The children slapping
their butts with the paddles

21:45.679 --> 21:49.341
was a curious event,
to say the least. Very curious.

21:49.491 --> 21:50.909
But I...

21:51.059 --> 21:52.811
Oof.

21:52.961 --> 21:54.563
Uh...

21:54.713 --> 21:57.833
Come on.
Show's about to start.

21:57.983 --> 22:00.686
I am finishing up
the monthly report.

22:00.836 --> 22:03.488
I will be there in two minutes.

22:15.867 --> 22:18.070
I must get laid very soon.

22:19.871 --> 22:21.440
Yes.

22:22.541 --> 22:26.445
I must get laid very soon.

22:28.413 --> 22:31.416
Hello, and welcome
to the premiere of Kitty Kat.

22:31.566 --> 22:34.019
A Q&A will follow.
Enjoy the show.

22:39.491 --> 22:42.377
Looks like you with a beard.
- Really? - Yeah.

22:42.527 --> 22:46.365
I think he's playing Lincoln.
- The following story may sound unbelievable,

22:46.515 --> 22:48.817
but I assure you
that every word of it is true.

22:48.967 --> 22:52.437
My name is Bobby and I've
lived on a farm my whole life.

22:54.606 --> 22:56.525
I inherited the farm
from my daddy,

22:56.675 --> 22:58.894
who inherited it
from his daddy before him.

22:59.044 --> 23:02.647
I'm what Cal Smith would call
a real country bumpkin.

23:03.749 --> 23:05.667
Country bumpkin?

23:05.817 --> 23:10.756
Living on a farm is hard work
and I love every minute of it.

23:10.906 --> 23:13.592
But it can be lonely.
Really lonely.

23:13.742 --> 23:15.794
I'm so lonely.

23:16.928 --> 23:19.030
The long days make it
practically impossible

23:19.180 --> 23:21.717
for a guy like me
to meet any women.

23:21.867 --> 23:26.171
But all that changed last week when I
noticed a car just farther up the road.

23:26.321 --> 23:30.041
The hood was popped open and the
sweetest little ass I have ever seen

23:30.191 --> 23:32.477
was bent over
checking out the engine.

23:32.627 --> 23:33.862
Her name was Kitty Kat.

23:34.012 --> 23:37.207
I'm Kitty,
but you can call me Kitty Kat.

23:37.357 --> 23:40.130
Hmm.
- I stared at her long and hard.

23:40.280 --> 23:43.054
Flowing blond hair
and her hard breasts

23:43.204 --> 23:45.791
bursting out
of her snug white T.

23:45.941 --> 23:47.276
Excuse me?
- Shhh.

23:47.426 --> 23:49.645
The moment was electric.
We barely spoke,

23:49.795 --> 23:52.130
and before I knew it,
I was rubbing up against her backside.

23:52.280 --> 23:53.382
Okay, okay, show's over.

23:53.532 --> 23:55.017
My johnson was purring
like a V8.

23:55.167 --> 23:57.077
Within minutes
I was balls-deep inside her.

23:57.227 --> 23:59.137
Okay, yeah...
- I said enough. What is this?

23:59.287 --> 24:00.789
Who wrote this?
Where'd you get it?

24:00.939 --> 24:03.575
Uh, from the book.
Uh, Penthouse Magazine.

24:06.645 --> 24:08.547
I need some air.
- It's not...

24:09.481 --> 24:11.600
Luke,
I'm-I'm disappointed in you.

24:11.750 --> 24:14.719
I mean, you should really, really let
your characters speak for themselves.

24:14.869 --> 24:16.721
The use of a narrator,
it's weak dramaturgy.

24:16.871 --> 24:18.890
It really is. Okay.

24:24.496 --> 24:26.064
Lock it up.

24:28.500 --> 24:30.677
Catherine? Sweetie?
Confirm your status,

24:30.827 --> 24:32.854
or I'll be forced
to break down this door.

24:33.004 --> 24:36.508
Leave me alone.
- Oh, come on, let me in, please. Cath.

24:36.658 --> 24:38.694
You okay?

24:38.844 --> 24:41.396
Our kids just put on a play
based on pornographic material.

24:41.546 --> 24:45.016
I'm as far from okay as one can
be and I have a fucking migraine.

24:45.166 --> 24:48.887
I just asked Samsonov
to lock up his skin mags, so...

24:49.037 --> 24:50.839
Good work, Columbo.
Problem solved.

24:50.989 --> 24:55.627
Catherine, you're gonna start
driving yourself crazy with this.

24:55.777 --> 24:58.563
You're just having
a mild panic attack.

24:58.713 --> 25:00.682
Okay? Go for a run.
Do something.

25:00.832 --> 25:03.485
You just don't get it, do you?

25:03.635 --> 25:06.705
I know you're upset.
- You're damn right I'm upset.

25:06.855 --> 25:08.890
I'm sorry.
I will lock everything up.

25:09.040 --> 25:12.177
My private collection
will soon be like Fort Knox.

25:12.327 --> 25:15.514
That's great.
How do you want to handle this?

25:15.664 --> 25:17.466
What you want me to do?

25:17.616 --> 25:21.720
I want you to care that Maurice wants to be
"ball-deep" into Maya!

25:21.870 --> 25:23.672
Oh, come on, it's a play.
Fictional characters.

25:23.822 --> 25:26.157
They probably don't even know
what "ball-deep" means.

25:26.307 --> 25:28.143
Oh, yes, they do!
- Big deal.

25:28.293 --> 25:30.587
Our son just directed
his first play.

25:30.737 --> 25:32.860
These...
are rock-hard-solid results.

25:33.010 --> 25:34.931
I don't care about...!
Fuck Gertz!

25:35.081 --> 25:36.852
I want to get
an outside opinion.

25:37.002 --> 25:38.920
About what?
- Well, I want to know if...

25:39.070 --> 25:41.740
fake-humping your sister onstage
in front of your parents

25:41.890 --> 25:44.242
is part of the normal sexual
development of a child.

25:44.392 --> 25:45.927
Of course it is.

25:46.077 --> 25:47.763
You think this is funny?
- No?

25:47.913 --> 25:49.798
What if it's deviant
sexual development?

25:49.948 --> 25:52.617
And what about the whole canoe
ass-slapping incident?

25:52.767 --> 25:54.886
What if it all adds up to, uh...

25:55.036 --> 25:56.605
dissociative behaviour?

25:56.755 --> 25:59.658
Deviant sexual development?

26:02.594 --> 26:04.963
We need to focus
on what's important here.

26:05.113 --> 26:06.931
Gertz is right.

26:07.081 --> 26:08.750
We need results.

26:08.900 --> 26:11.937
Oh, honey pie,
we're so close.

26:12.087 --> 26:14.406
No... What are you doing?

26:14.556 --> 26:16.725
I am reassuring you.
- Mom?

26:16.875 --> 26:20.145
Maurice put this on my bed.
- Oh my G... Just get rid of it.

26:20.295 --> 26:23.081
Can I put it on his bed?
- No! Just get rid of it!

26:23.231 --> 26:26.000
And put on some decent clothing
while you're at it!

26:26.150 --> 26:28.770
Mom's right. Just get rid of it, honey.
- God!

26:28.920 --> 26:31.823
Catherine, Catherine, Catherine,
Catherine, just let it all go.

26:31.973 --> 26:34.059
Don't say my name repeatedly.
It's condescending.

26:34.209 --> 26:35.911
Okay.

26:36.061 --> 26:39.130
I just want someone who can
tell me my kids are okay.

26:39.280 --> 26:41.666
Mom? Dad?

26:43.902 --> 26:47.622
You tried to flush it?
- Why not?

26:47.772 --> 26:49.741
Oh, come on,
you're smarter than that.

26:49.891 --> 26:51.242
Clearly not.

26:53.078 --> 26:54.713
We need help.

26:59.117 --> 27:01.252
Okay, I want Julie.

27:01.402 --> 27:02.753
Never.

27:02.903 --> 27:04.422
Why not?

27:04.572 --> 27:06.091
Ne-ver.

27:20.271 --> 27:23.942
Dr. Julie Bouchard
was a child psychiatrist

27:24.092 --> 27:25.794
and an old friend
of Catherine's

27:25.944 --> 27:29.014
whom she had not seen
in over a decade.

27:30.281 --> 27:32.651
Hey!

27:36.287 --> 27:38.707
Ben despised Julie.

27:38.857 --> 27:41.826
I'm so happy to see you!

27:42.994 --> 27:46.931
He considered her
a mediocre scientist at best,

27:47.081 --> 27:49.334
and attributed
her academic success

27:49.484 --> 27:52.237
to her sculpted cheekbones.

27:52.387 --> 27:55.140
Hi, Ben.
- Hey, Julie.

27:55.290 --> 27:57.025
Looking good.

27:57.175 --> 27:58.760
Yeah.

27:58.910 --> 28:01.237
How's the, uh...
how's the old campus?

28:01.387 --> 28:03.543
I'm running three labs now.
- Wow!

28:03.693 --> 28:05.700
Published four times
last year.

28:05.850 --> 28:09.387
Yeah, life's good, life's good.
- My God! That's amazing! Congratulations!

28:09.537 --> 28:12.173
How about you guys?
How's country living?

28:12.323 --> 28:14.959
Yeah. Life is... it's, uh...
it's very good.

28:15.109 --> 28:16.361
It's pretty sweet.
- Great.

28:16.511 --> 28:18.096
Great.

28:20.198 --> 28:24.736
Julie, thank you so much for, you know,
coming all this way. Long trip.

28:24.886 --> 28:28.106
Uh... but, uh, to be honest,
I think that my wife -

28:28.256 --> 28:29.891
my lovely wife -
may have overreacted.

28:30.041 --> 28:32.077
A little bit. A smidge.
And the kids are fine,

28:32.227 --> 28:34.062
they're really fine,
really great.

28:34.212 --> 28:36.347
They're fucking awesome.
- Ben, please.

28:36.497 --> 28:39.350
We cool here?
- We cool.

28:39.500 --> 28:40.969
Cool.

28:41.119 --> 28:43.354
I... Okay, so I thought
I'd take them out,

28:43.504 --> 28:45.640
see how they operate
on their own.

28:45.790 --> 28:49.360
Sounds good to me.
- We should stick around here. We usually take them out.

28:49.510 --> 28:52.764
Don't worry, Ben. We'll be back by
suppertime. Where are the kids?!

28:52.914 --> 28:54.299
Yeah.

28:55.433 --> 28:57.235
Hi!
- Hi.

28:58.269 --> 28:59.788
Sammy.

28:59.938 --> 29:02.282
Luke! Guys?!

29:02.432 --> 29:04.626
"Luke! Guys!"

29:04.776 --> 29:08.179
It's always Luke and the two others.
- Oh, shut up.

29:08.329 --> 29:10.865
I got a surprise! Come on!

29:11.015 --> 29:13.368
Coming!
What the hell is wrong with her?

29:13.518 --> 29:17.222
Come on, Luke,
run like a good little dog to Mommy.

29:17.372 --> 29:20.191
Asshole. That is what you are.

They're... they're awesome.

Ha! What'd I tell you?
Thank you, Julie. Thank you.

31:11.652 --> 31:13.922
Awesome how?
- Well...

31:14.072 --> 31:16.725
even after 12 years
of homeschooling,

31:16.875 --> 31:21.045
they were perfectly at ease
in this social environment.

31:21.195 --> 31:22.981
They weren't intimidated.

31:23.131 --> 31:24.365
They socialized.

31:24.515 --> 31:27.385
So now dissociative behaviour
symptoms?

31:27.535 --> 31:29.070
Catherine, listen,

31:29.220 --> 31:32.991
I've worked with hundreds,
if not thousands, of teenagers,

31:33.141 --> 31:34.843
I've seen them steal, drink,

31:34.993 --> 31:39.430
lie, beat up their parents,
beat up each other,

31:39.580 --> 31:42.066
beat themselves up,
touching themselves...

31:42.216 --> 31:43.985
touching each other,

31:44.135 --> 31:45.754
touching their pets.

31:45.904 --> 31:48.965
To varying degrees,
it's all somewhat normal.

31:49.115 --> 31:52.176
So I know my analysis
is extremely superficial,

31:52.326 --> 31:55.780
but trust me,
your kids are fine.

31:55.930 --> 31:59.384
No, Julie...
my kids are not fine.

32:02.253 --> 32:03.905
What am I missing here?

32:04.055 --> 32:07.158
Excuse me.

32:11.329 --> 32:13.498
It's a very interesting
analysis you made.

32:13.648 --> 32:15.316
Thank you.

32:15.466 --> 32:17.435
You like lamb?
- Lamb? Yeah.

32:17.585 --> 32:19.370
Then stay for dinner.

32:19.520 --> 32:20.889
I made kebabs,

32:21.039 --> 32:23.942
and a light garden salad.

32:36.421 --> 32:38.373
Where did you get this?

32:38.523 --> 32:41.367
Hmm? Where did you get this?!

32:41.517 --> 32:44.362
Julie gave it to us.

32:47.131 --> 32:48.733
What's wrong?

32:52.136 --> 32:55.440
Maurice,
do your breathing exercises.

32:55.590 --> 32:56.825
But...

32:56.975 --> 32:59.477
I knew it. I fucking knew it.

32:59.627 --> 33:01.362
Asshole.

33:01.512 --> 33:04.098
Maybe throw in
some horseradish.

33:04.248 --> 33:07.352
Horseradish.
- Mm-hmm.

33:08.619 --> 33:10.572
You gave this to our kids?

33:10.722 --> 33:14.525
They liked it in the car,
so I gave it to them. Is it a problem?

33:15.493 --> 33:17.003
Calm down, Ben.

33:17.153 --> 33:18.817
It's just music.

33:18.967 --> 33:20.481
You should leave.

33:20.631 --> 33:22.951
What is wrong with you?
- Please go.

33:23.101 --> 33:26.404
You are such a freak.
Always have been.

33:26.554 --> 33:28.706

33:33.536 --> 33:36.418

33:39.450 --> 33:42.687
If anyone needs help here,
it's you. It's not your kids.

33:42.837 --> 33:45.189
Sorry.
- Bye, Julie.

33:49.360 --> 33:51.195

34:27.130 --> 34:30.051
You can't even drive
the lawnmower.

34:30.201 --> 34:33.021
I can totally drive.
Want to bet?

34:33.170 --> 34:36.174
It's really not that hard.
Sammy showed me.

34:40.244 --> 34:42.362
Well, I could do it.
- Maurice, come on,

34:42.513 --> 34:45.716
everyone already knows I'm a way
better driver than you anyway.

34:46.717 --> 34:49.527
I... don't think
this is a good idea anymore.

34:49.678 --> 34:52.489
What are you talking about?
Of course it is!

34:58.663 --> 35:01.149
For Luke,
Maurice and Maya,

35:01.299 --> 35:04.385
the afternoon spent
frolicking in the pool,

35:04.535 --> 35:07.805
away from their parents,
triggered an awakening.

35:07.955 --> 35:10.124
Meanwhile, Ben and Catherine

35:10.274 --> 35:12.668
were finding it
increasingly difficult

35:12.818 --> 35:15.213
to agree on the right course
of action.

35:16.280 --> 35:19.817
And had not gone
for a horsey ride in weeks.

36:28.419 --> 36:30.888
What the hell
are they doing here?

36:41.732 --> 36:44.702
Hi!
- Hi! What a surprise! This is so cool!

36:44.852 --> 36:46.904
I got goodies!

36:57.381 --> 37:00.218
Have you heard
of Alfred Russel Wallace?

37:00.368 --> 37:02.503
Uh... reggae guy?
- No.

37:02.653 --> 37:04.789
19th-century biologist.

37:06.224 --> 37:08.793
Potentially the greatest
field biologist of his time.

37:09.727 --> 37:12.863
Like Darwin, he proposed
a theory of evolution.

37:13.013 --> 37:15.249
Yet nobody's ever heard of him.

37:15.399 --> 37:18.236
A man completely forgotten
by history.

37:18.386 --> 37:20.004
Why do you think that is?

37:22.440 --> 37:24.775
Because Darwin published first.

37:25.743 --> 37:27.720
He simply wanted it more.

37:27.870 --> 37:29.847
He was more determined.

37:31.249 --> 37:33.334
What is this?

37:33.484 --> 37:37.989
Two Portuguese scientists are conducting
the same experiment as you guys.

37:39.590 --> 37:43.894
They've got two pair of twins,
and they're nurturing them

37:44.044 --> 37:45.730
on intelligence, creativity,
aggression,

37:45.880 --> 37:47.448
and sexual orientation.

37:47.598 --> 37:51.669
So you see, there's no point in
being Alfred fucking Wallace.

37:53.437 --> 37:55.039
Just watch.

37:58.876 --> 38:00.611
Aggression.

38:04.548 --> 38:06.984
Sexual orientation.

38:10.388 --> 38:12.723
Damn those Portuguese.
Every time.

38:14.992 --> 38:17.145
But... this is medieval.

38:17.295 --> 38:19.538
It has nothing to do
with what we're doing here.

38:19.688 --> 38:21.753
You're missing the point.
- Well, you may like

38:21.903 --> 38:23.968
these short-term results
of these Portuguese guys,

38:24.118 --> 38:25.853
but that's exactly
what they are: short-term.

38:26.003 --> 38:28.489
In 10 years' time, these kids
are gonna be whacked.

38:28.639 --> 38:31.392
Whacked?
- Yeah! You can't raise kids like caged animals.

38:31.542 --> 38:35.680
We have brought up our kids as normally
as possible given the circumstances,

38:35.830 --> 38:38.649
and I'm only hoping now
that they'll be okay.

38:38.799 --> 38:40.201
Catherine,
you're not listening to me.

38:40.351 --> 38:41.903
We are way past the point
of discussion here.

38:42.053 --> 38:44.839
Now, what I want from you is to
act on what I'm telling you!

38:44.989 --> 38:49.593
Oh, oh, oh! So you want us to go medieval on
our kids? Have you lost your fucking mind?

38:49.743 --> 38:52.463
Can you calm her down? Is there a switch?
- No.

38:52.613 --> 38:54.582
Oh, my God.
- Anything wrong here?

38:54.732 --> 38:58.669
Nobody cares about the second
man on the moon, Catherine!

38:58.819 --> 39:00.188
We need to be the first.

39:00.338 --> 39:02.807
Well, not like this.
- If that's your attitude,

39:02.957 --> 39:05.443
maybe you're not ready
to finish this job.

39:05.593 --> 39:08.396
I want the kids.

39:08.546 --> 39:10.665
What do you mean,
you want the kids?

39:10.815 --> 39:14.593
If you don't have the humility to learn
from your Portuguese counterparts,

39:14.743 --> 39:18.522
I'm gonna ask Phyllis here to take
care of them for the final sprint.

39:18.672 --> 39:20.208
What?
- Your maid?

39:20.358 --> 39:23.244
Personal assistant.
And they love her.

39:23.394 --> 39:26.447
You need to get the fuck out of here!
- Excuse me?

39:26.597 --> 39:30.534
Oh, you heard me!
Back on your horse, Billy fucking Bronco!

39:39.377 --> 39:41.470
Turn that off!

39:41.620 --> 39:43.564
Mom! Dig deep!

39:43.714 --> 39:45.916
Find that serenity!

39:46.066 --> 39:47.935
Dig deep!

39:48.085 --> 39:51.655
Yeah, she's been really strung out,
but don't worry,

39:51.805 --> 39:54.575
we're gonna do
what we have to do.

39:54.725 --> 39:57.728
For sure, that's all I want to hear.
Here. Take this.

39:57.878 --> 39:59.764
Mm-hmm.
- Who the hell's Bronco Billy?

40:03.567 --> 40:06.470
Mom! Dig deep!

40:08.406 --> 40:11.776
Phyllis can be very maternal!
Could be good for everyone!

40:11.926 --> 40:13.627
It's a win-win!

40:13.777 --> 40:15.479
Think about it!

40:19.984 --> 40:22.820
That's it.
Shit!

40:24.422 --> 40:27.658
Let it all out!
Like the rivers of Babylon!

40:27.808 --> 40:29.644
Take off! Take off! Quick!

40:29.794 --> 40:32.280
What are you doing?!
- Oh, my God!

40:32.430 --> 40:35.933
That goddamn cavewoman...
just stuck an axe in my chopper!

40:36.083 --> 40:38.019
Okay.

40:38.169 --> 40:40.855
What was that?! You need to calm down.
- Don't even.

40:41.005 --> 40:44.442
What was to be gained by threatening
to take away their children?!

40:44.592 --> 40:46.143
Oh, put a sock in it, Phyllis!

40:46.293 --> 40:48.696
Sweetie... honey...

40:48.846 --> 40:50.965
Your behaviour
was only disgraceful!

40:51.115 --> 40:54.919
You're a personal assistant! This is
above your pay scale, don't you think?

40:55.069 --> 40:56.304
Calm down.

40:56.454 --> 40:58.155
I love you guys.

41:00.624 --> 41:02.117
Catherine?

41:02.267 --> 41:03.761
Okay...

41:23.714 --> 41:25.249
Hey there.

41:29.820 --> 41:31.188
Nuts?

41:37.661 --> 41:39.230
Tough day, huh?

41:43.834 --> 41:45.569
Do you want me to leave?

41:45.719 --> 41:47.738
Mm. No, stay.

41:49.773 --> 41:51.842
Want to talk about Gertz?

41:54.678 --> 41:56.838
Want to talk about the kids?

41:56.988 --> 41:59.395
Want to talk about my...

41:59.545 --> 42:01.952
stunning Olympic career?

42:05.055 --> 42:10.561
You know, it was my great-grandfather
who taught me how to... shoot.

42:10.711 --> 42:12.480
Oh.
- I didn't tell you, eh?

42:12.630 --> 42:15.658
Yes, he was born in Greece
and he moved to Estonia,

42:15.808 --> 42:18.848

and I shot all sorts of things:

42:18.998 --> 42:22.039
rocks or, you know, wood.
Not animals, you know,

42:22.189 --> 42:24.775

to eat them. But...

42:24.925 --> 42:27.044
Let's just, uh...

42:27.194 --> 42:28.729
What?

42:28.879 --> 42:30.722

42:30.872 --> 42:32.716
Is that okay?
- Okay.

43:08.752 --> 43:10.287
Ahem.

43:20.931 --> 43:22.833
Good night, Mom.

43:39.116 --> 43:40.634
Okay, ready?

43:40.784 --> 43:43.253
Yeah,
I just have one question.

43:43.403 --> 43:44.805
Sure.

43:44.955 --> 43:47.992
Um. Do you think I'm more
like you or like Mom?

43:53.130 --> 43:54.865
That's a big question.

43:56.266 --> 43:58.202
That's a good question.

44:00.804 --> 44:02.957
Uh... I mean...

44:03.107 --> 44:05.059
Hang on.
Okay.

44:05.209 --> 44:07.277
Here's the thing, Luke.

44:07.427 --> 44:09.046
Um...

44:10.648 --> 44:13.050
Your play, Kitty Kat.

44:14.084 --> 44:17.821
Borderline inappropriate,
but you're an artist, Luke,

44:17.971 --> 44:22.259
and what I got from it
was you are at an age

44:22.409 --> 44:23.978
where there's - pfft -

44:24.128 --> 44:27.172
a lot of stuff
stirring up inside you,

44:27.322 --> 44:30.367
a lot of energy,
a lot of sexual energy,

44:30.517 --> 44:31.752
and, boy...

44:31.902 --> 44:34.204
...that's a powerful force.
A force...

44:35.272 --> 44:39.810
...that you can learn to use
to your own advantage.

44:39.960 --> 44:41.895

44:50.187 --> 44:52.056

44:54.825 --> 44:56.644
Ready? Ahem.

44:56.794 --> 44:59.697
Yeah, uh, I, um,
I really don't want to do this.

44:59.847 --> 45:01.732
I know, I know,
but I want you to do is,

45:01.882 --> 45:03.450

that energy.

45:03.600 --> 45:05.143
I want you to harness
that energy,

45:05.293 --> 45:06.837
I want you
to channel that force,

45:06.987 --> 45:09.056
that sexual force inside you.

45:09.206 --> 45:13.243
And I want you to just,
you know, release it into dance.

45:14.812 --> 45:17.865
Y-you want me to dance
my sexual emotion?

45:18.015 --> 45:21.251
Exactly. I want you to just,
you know, dance your sexual emotions.

45:21.401 --> 45:23.037
Ahem. With you?

45:23.187 --> 45:26.031
No... I mean... No, no. No.

absolutely bonkers right now.

50:51.782 --> 50:56.586
I mean, he would hate it if I told you this,
he would kill me, but, uh...

50:58.188 --> 51:00.649
...he likes me to dress up
as a thoroughbred.

51:00.799 --> 51:03.506
I put on this little tail
and it's really...

51:03.656 --> 51:06.302
it's very silly,
and I just want to be 18 again.

51:06.452 --> 51:09.099

51:10.834 --> 51:13.203

I should be briefed about?

56:38.678 --> 56:40.430
No.

56:41.698 --> 56:45.068
You threw out the television
and burned many books.

a change of plan.

56:48.288 --> 56:51.258
There is. Or there was.

56:51.408 --> 56:56.045
But, uh, Catherine has asked me
to put everything on hold.

56:56.195 --> 56:57.814
Ah.

56:59.015 --> 57:01.551
So what should I write
in the weekly report?

57:01.701 --> 57:03.803
What do you mean?

57:03.953 --> 57:08.558
Well, won't it look strange to have
a pause at such a crucial time?

57:08.708 --> 57:10.894
Scientifically speaking?

57:11.044 --> 57:12.512
If I may,

57:12.662 --> 57:15.598
I really don't think
this is the time

57:15.748 --> 57:17.417
to be taking a pause.

57:17.567 --> 57:20.537
Catherine's not really in the
mood for negotiating right now.

57:20.687 --> 57:22.906
Uh, you know,
she's pretty out of it.

57:23.840 --> 57:27.510
You're right.
She will be out of it for a few days.

57:27.660 --> 57:29.112
Yeah.

57:31.614 --> 57:32.932

57:33.082 --> 57:35.218

You'll always be Daddy's
little little girl, pumpkin,

58:05.949 --> 58:09.786
but you're getting to an age
when you're gonna have to start

58:09.936 --> 58:12.989
making a lot of decisions
for yourself. Yeah. Oh, yeah.

58:13.139 --> 58:14.674
A lot of judgment calls.

58:14.824 --> 58:17.627
But this, this game,
whoa, it's gonna help.

58:20.663 --> 58:22.198
Can I take it?
- Sure.

58:24.067 --> 58:26.119
Careful.
- It's so cute!

58:26.269 --> 58:29.389
You know, millions of mice
like this one,

58:29.539 --> 58:32.667
every day sacrifice
for the progress of mankind.

58:32.817 --> 58:35.591
What are we going to do?
- Good question. Okay.

58:35.741 --> 58:38.365
The mouse enters here
and you have to help him

58:38.515 --> 58:40.917
find his way out by opening
or closing these doors.

58:41.067 --> 58:42.969
But if you make a mistake,

58:43.119 --> 58:45.405
there are consequences.
- What?

58:45.555 --> 58:49.192
Know that there are consequences
to bad decisions, just like life.

58:49.342 --> 58:51.127
Okay.

58:51.277 --> 58:52.912
Ready?

58:53.062 --> 58:55.198
Let's play mouse-tricity.

59:00.136 --> 59:02.155
Good girl. That's it.

59:02.305 --> 59:04.674
You're doing really well,
Maymay.

59:04.824 --> 59:06.726
Oh, he's at an impasse.

59:06.876 --> 59:09.112
Mm-hmm.
Come on, come on, come on.

59:09.262 --> 59:12.282
Okay, okay. Oh, oh, oh...

59:12.432 --> 59:14.233
wrong door.

59:14.383 --> 59:16.035
Oh. Oh.

59:16.185 --> 59:18.772
Oh!

59:18.922 --> 59:20.874
Dad!

59:21.024 --> 59:23.443
Stop! What are you doing?!

59:23.593 --> 59:25.945
You killed it!
- You took all the decisions,

59:26.095 --> 59:28.932
you gotta take responsibility.
- You killed it, Dad!

59:29.082 --> 59:31.351
You're so mean! I hate you!
- Maya...

59:31.501 --> 59:33.770
don't be upset.
It's just... a mouse.

59:33.920 --> 59:35.021
Why would you do this?!

59:35.171 --> 59:38.425
What the hell
is going on here?

59:38.575 --> 59:41.611
Whoa, hon, you shouldn't be
walking around.

59:41.761 --> 59:44.030
You should go back to bed.

59:44.180 --> 59:47.434
You promised...
you promised me a hiatus.

59:47.584 --> 59:51.788
Well, a lot of promises were made, Catherine.
A lot of promises were made.

59:51.938 --> 59:53.973
Well, so, what are you doing?

59:54.123 --> 59:58.895
I knew you'd react like this,
so I had to push on.

59:59.045 --> 01:00:00.930
I couldn't tell you.
- Well...

01:00:04.367 --> 01:00:06.477
I'm done.

01:00:06.627 --> 01:00:08.588
I'm, uh...

01:00:08.738 --> 01:00:10.840
Yeah, I'm-I'm telling the kids.

01:00:10.990 --> 01:00:12.225
About what?
- Everything.

01:00:12.375 --> 01:00:14.093
I'm just...
I'm gonna tell them everything.

01:00:14.243 --> 01:00:17.614
Ca-Catherine, this is no time
to act crazy. Just listen to me.

01:00:17.764 --> 01:00:19.699
No! You listen to me.

01:00:19.849 --> 01:00:22.068
You are the crazy one, okay?!

01:00:22.218 --> 01:00:24.846
I mean, look at yourself,
for chrissakes!

01:00:24.996 --> 01:00:27.474
You look like
a goddamn mental patient!

01:00:27.624 --> 01:00:31.928
I look like a mental patient?!
Take a damn look in the mirror, sweetheart!

01:00:42.405 --> 01:00:46.209
United, we stand.
- Divided, we fall.

01:00:48.111 --> 01:00:51.714
Uh, good,
but just try it again.

01:00:53.816 --> 01:00:55.635
Action!

01:00:55.785 --> 01:00:58.329
United, we stand!

01:00:58.479 --> 01:01:00.874
Divided, we fall.

01:01:01.024 --> 01:01:04.127
I can't.
I'm just so sick of it.

01:01:04.277 --> 01:01:06.195
It's...

01:01:09.265 --> 01:01:11.200
I'm sick of it.

01:01:12.802 --> 01:01:15.313
Catherine... Ca-Catherine!

01:01:15.463 --> 01:01:17.824
Come on. Catherine!

01:01:17.974 --> 01:01:20.693
Catherine? Oh... Catherine!

01:01:20.843 --> 01:01:23.997
Luke?
- Open the door! - Guys!

01:01:24.147 --> 01:01:26.916
Stop, Catherine!
- Where are you?! - You can't do that!

01:01:27.066 --> 01:01:29.886
Shit.
- Catherine!

01:01:30.036 --> 01:01:31.421
Catherine!

01:01:33.990 --> 01:01:36.759
Don't do it!
- They're not even here.

01:01:38.461 --> 01:01:40.329
Oh, jeez!

01:01:41.297 --> 01:01:43.925
What are you doing?! Stop, stop!
- Stop!

01:01:44.075 --> 01:01:46.703
Luke, open the door.
This is dangerous.

01:01:46.853 --> 01:01:48.938
No!

01:01:50.006 --> 01:01:52.500
What is she saying?
- She's drunk.

01:01:52.650 --> 01:01:54.956
She loves the Dutch?
- I'm so sorry!

01:01:55.106 --> 01:01:56.985
She's horny
and wants some brew?

01:01:57.135 --> 01:01:58.865
Cut this engine right now!

01:01:59.015 --> 01:02:01.642
You're in a lot of trouble,
young man!

01:02:01.792 --> 01:02:04.332
Open up.
- Stop! Put down the window!

01:02:04.482 --> 01:02:07.023
Listen, we lied to you.
- Here we go!

01:02:07.173 --> 01:02:08.858
Oh!

01:02:16.799 --> 01:02:19.919

01:02:20.069 --> 01:02:22.105

01:02:39.021 --> 01:02:41.791
So what the bejesus happened?

01:02:43.326 --> 01:02:46.529
They, uh,
they caused a 19-car pileup on the 141.

01:02:46.679 --> 01:02:50.216
Hmm.
- Wow. - Not a scratch on them,

01:02:50.366 --> 01:02:53.536
but Social Services
got a court order, so...

01:02:53.686 --> 01:02:56.405
So...
now we can't see the kids.

01:02:56.555 --> 01:02:58.941
Bloody fascists.

01:03:02.145 --> 01:03:06.916
Now, I believe this incident
falls under the...

01:03:07.066 --> 01:03:10.353
blowing-up-in-your-face clause.

01:03:10.503 --> 01:03:13.356
Which is...

01:03:13.506 --> 01:03:16.209
paragraph 36-B.

01:03:16.359 --> 01:03:19.036
Since there's been a breach
in the contract,

01:03:19.186 --> 01:03:21.864
that means that you're obligated
to refund -

01:03:22.014 --> 01:03:23.533
according
to my astute accountants -

01:03:23.683 --> 01:03:26.019
a little over $1.4 million.

01:03:26.169 --> 01:03:28.713
Hold on here.
W-we had our knees cut

01:03:28.863 --> 01:03:31.545
as we were crossing
the finish line.

01:03:31.695 --> 01:03:34.362
We had... this.
We had this in the bag.

01:03:34.512 --> 01:03:37.180
Well, now you're holding
an empty bag.

01:03:37.330 --> 01:03:39.098
And I won't lie to you.

01:03:39.248 --> 01:03:41.834
The timing of this incident
could not be better.

01:03:41.984 --> 01:03:46.088
We lost our kids. You get that, right?
Does he...? He gets that, right?

01:03:46.238 --> 01:03:48.207
Oh, I do. That's why
I'm willing to deal here.

01:03:48.357 --> 01:03:52.428
To be frank, I haven't been...
perfectly forthcoming with you.

01:03:52.578 --> 01:03:53.980
What do you mean?

01:03:54.130 --> 01:03:56.532
I'm so sorry.
- Zip it, Phyllis.

01:03:56.682 --> 01:03:58.284
No, what?
- I swear,

01:03:58.434 --> 01:04:04.106
I had no idea of the extent
of the deception until recently.

01:04:04.256 --> 01:04:05.858
I said zip it, Phyllis.

01:04:06.008 --> 01:04:07.760
What deception?
- You see, throughout history,

01:04:07.910 --> 01:04:10.797
scientists have used humans
and animals as guinea pigs.

01:04:10.947 --> 01:04:15.318
So where do you draw the line between
protecting dignity and promoting progress?

01:04:15.468 --> 01:04:16.736
I don't understand, I...

01:04:16.886 --> 01:04:19.956
Well, in this case,
science is a guinea pig.

01:04:20.106 --> 01:04:22.325
You're the guinea pigs.

01:04:23.292 --> 01:04:25.328
My guinea pigs.

01:04:26.429 --> 01:04:28.781
What do you mean?
- Yeah.

01:04:28.931 --> 01:04:33.269
Well... while you were experimenting on
your kids, I was experimenting on you.

01:04:33.419 --> 01:04:34.987
How?!

01:04:35.137 --> 01:04:37.815
Well, the working title for my book is:
The Rationalizing

01:04:37.965 --> 01:04:40.714
of Unethical Behaviour
for the So-Called Greater Good.

01:04:40.864 --> 01:04:43.613
My... my editor wants something
with a bit more pizzazz.

01:04:43.763 --> 01:04:46.999
So, uh...

01:04:47.149 --> 01:04:48.868
What are you gonna write?

01:04:49.018 --> 01:04:51.187
Well, basically,
that you've been using your kids

01:04:51.337 --> 01:04:53.572
as lab rats.
That's the basic premise.

01:04:53.722 --> 01:04:56.316
How dare you?
- The hell do you... know?

01:04:56.466 --> 01:04:59.061
What the hell can you, uh,
even write about?

01:04:59.211 --> 01:05:00.379
I-I... You know, I'm...

01:05:00.529 --> 01:05:04.634
Well...
Samsonov kept a tight log...

01:05:06.168 --> 01:05:08.571
...of every minute detail.

01:05:11.073 --> 01:05:15.144
And you!
Our kids loved you.

01:05:15.294 --> 01:05:17.663
What about the, uh...

01:05:17.813 --> 01:05:20.032
the, uh... Portuguese?

01:05:20.182 --> 01:05:23.069
I made that up.

01:05:23.219 --> 01:05:26.155
There were no Portuguese, Ben.
I just did it to see

01:05:26.305 --> 01:05:28.491
how far you were willing to go.

01:05:33.195 --> 01:05:35.948
You... you cuntbag.

01:05:36.098 --> 01:05:38.968
Don't you see
how fucking unethical this is?

01:05:39.118 --> 01:05:41.220
I mean,
do you see the irony here?

01:05:41.370 --> 01:05:43.322
Can we remain professional
here?

01:05:43.472 --> 01:05:47.276
Now, I am willing
to rip up your contract

01:05:47.426 --> 01:05:50.062
and forget
about the $1.4 million

01:05:50.212 --> 01:05:53.900
if you sign this short
but effective release form.

01:05:54.050 --> 01:05:58.521
It's pretty straightforward. It basically
says that I forget about your debt,

01:05:58.671 --> 01:06:02.358
and in return, you have no say
over what I publish.

01:06:02.508 --> 01:06:03.810
You've ruined everything!

01:06:03.960 --> 01:06:07.330
Come on. See it
as turning over a new leaf.

01:06:07.480 --> 01:06:09.148
It's a new day.

01:06:09.298 --> 01:06:10.967
Tabula rasa.

01:06:12.068 --> 01:06:13.970
Hmm.

01:06:38.094 --> 01:06:40.554
Hello. Hello, Ben.

01:06:40.704 --> 01:06:43.165
Hello, Catherine.

01:06:46.268 --> 01:06:47.169
How are you?

01:06:51.440 --> 01:06:53.642
How are... the children?

01:06:54.577 --> 01:06:57.013
Ah! Ah!

01:06:58.447 --> 01:07:00.016
Why?

01:07:06.756 --> 01:07:08.608
Commie sonofabitch.

01:07:08.758 --> 01:07:12.128
Why you do that...
to me?

01:07:12.278 --> 01:07:15.031
Why? Why the balls?

01:07:16.332 --> 01:07:19.827
Ben and Catherine exhausted
every possible option,

01:07:19.977 --> 01:07:23.472
both legal and illegal,
to retrieve their children,

01:07:23.622 --> 01:07:26.325
but failed
time and time again.

01:07:26.475 --> 01:07:29.612
I see you're taking
the, uh, canoe paddle.

01:07:29.762 --> 01:07:32.214
Hmm. Which is mine.

01:07:33.149 --> 01:07:36.385
Yeah, but you're living
in the city now, so...

01:07:38.154 --> 01:07:39.538
I left you the spare.

01:07:39.688 --> 01:07:43.426
And after 13 years
of marriage,

01:07:43.576 --> 01:07:45.227
they parted ways.

01:07:45.377 --> 01:07:47.413
Drive safe.

01:07:47.563 --> 01:07:50.483
Social Services helped
place the children

01:07:50.633 --> 01:07:55.104
at the Saint-Patrick Academy,
a therapeutic boarding school

01:07:55.254 --> 01:07:58.074
for kids coming
from difficult circumstances.

01:07:58.224 --> 01:08:00.326
Sequestered from
their parents,

01:08:00.476 --> 01:08:04.380
their integration
was immediate and seamless.

01:08:04.530 --> 01:08:06.666
Maya was
a top-notch student...

01:08:06.816 --> 01:08:10.519
Push down. It melts the snow and reduces friction.
- What?

01:08:10.669 --> 01:08:12.655
...excelling
in several disciplines.

01:08:12.805 --> 01:08:14.423
Just go.

01:08:18.194 --> 01:08:21.279
But had little interest
in her studies.

01:08:21.430 --> 01:08:24.867
Maurice developed a keen
interest in Asian philosophies

01:08:25.017 --> 01:08:27.770
and volunteered his time
as a referee

01:08:27.920 --> 01:08:30.523
with the Saint-Patrick
Boxing Bandits.

01:08:30.673 --> 01:08:34.243
Anger is poison.
Always respect your opponent.

01:08:34.393 --> 01:08:36.761
Fight fair. Carry on, boys.

01:08:36.912 --> 01:08:39.189
Luke joined
a group of artists

01:08:39.339 --> 01:08:41.466
known
as The Saint-Patrick Four,

01:08:41.617 --> 01:08:44.069
now rebranded
the Saint-Patrick Five,

01:08:44.220 --> 01:08:47.857
who were committed to publicly
expressing their every instinct.

01:08:48.006 --> 01:08:50.759
Ladies and gentlemen,
I now present to you:

01:08:52.228 --> 01:08:54.563
The Uniboob.

01:08:56.866 --> 01:09:00.118
Luke felt The Uniboob
was misunderstood

01:09:00.269 --> 01:09:04.640
and channelled his energy
into a passion project.

Both parents
felt overwhelming agony

01:09:19.212 --> 01:09:21.828
about being cut
from their children.

01:09:21.978 --> 01:09:24.593
Catherine found solace
on the treadmill,

01:09:24.743 --> 01:09:27.013
but her greatest
fear realized

01:09:27.162 --> 01:09:29.598
moments before
the commercial break.

was ranked 17th

on the National
Bestseller list.

01:09:44.279 --> 01:09:47.349
"The doctors used their kids
like a chef uses an egg,

01:09:47.499 --> 01:09:49.135
as an ingredient
for something greater.

01:09:49.285 --> 01:09:52.654
The eggs were whipped and beaten
for 12 excruciating years

01:09:52.805 --> 01:09:55.824
in an attempt to make
the ultimate omelet."

01:09:58.928 --> 01:10:02.631
They're dead to me.
- I never want to see them again.

01:10:06.368 --> 01:10:08.537
I think I'm having a seizure.

01:11:09.531 --> 01:11:10.899
Hey.

01:11:12.301 --> 01:11:15.971
You, uh... you've come back
for the paddle?

01:11:19.708 --> 01:11:21.610
I thought you should see this.

01:11:25.581 --> 01:11:27.566
I don't get it.

01:11:27.716 --> 01:11:31.487
Well, those are our kids.
They're the guinea pigs.

01:11:31.637 --> 01:11:33.622
What guinea pigs?

01:11:34.657 --> 01:11:37.293
When is the last time
you left the house?

01:11:38.327 --> 01:11:41.730
I don't know. Last, uh...
Wednesday maybe.

01:11:42.731 --> 01:11:44.650
Gertz published.

01:11:44.800 --> 01:11:47.153
The whole school knows
who they are.

01:11:47.303 --> 01:11:49.638
They're gonna be humiliated
and bullied or...

01:11:49.788 --> 01:11:51.473
who knows what else.

01:11:53.442 --> 01:11:55.311
I really screwed up, didn't I?

01:11:58.480 --> 01:12:00.640
Clean yourself up
and come with me, okay?

01:12:00.790 --> 01:12:02.951
I'll... explain everything
in the car.

01:12:03.101 --> 01:12:04.620
I'll wait outside.

01:12:07.756 --> 01:12:09.758
Okay. Yeah.

01:12:09.908 --> 01:12:11.327
Yeah.

01:12:12.895 --> 01:12:14.663
Yep.

01:12:28.777 --> 01:12:31.914
May I help you?
- Hi, I'm Linda McCoy. I'm just here to see my kids.

01:12:32.064 --> 01:12:34.450
Who?
- Yeah, yeah, just some family business.

01:12:34.600 --> 01:12:36.118
I'll be back in a jiff.
- Excuse me!

01:12:42.925 --> 01:12:45.361
Oh, my God.

01:12:58.807 --> 01:13:00.542
Anything?

01:13:07.950 --> 01:13:09.718
Bend that front knee,
Jarred.

01:13:09.868 --> 01:13:11.553
There you go.

01:13:11.703 --> 01:13:13.389
Very good.

01:13:15.491 --> 01:13:18.594
Lead with the arm, Brittany.
There you go! Excellent.

01:13:18.744 --> 01:13:21.029
You guys see that?
That's great form.

01:13:22.131 --> 01:13:24.408
In with the arm, Brit...

01:13:24.558 --> 01:13:27.056
Uh... excuse me?
- Yeah.

01:13:27.206 --> 01:13:29.555
Can I help you?
- Uh...

01:13:29.705 --> 01:13:33.442
We're just, we're just, uh...
we're looking for, uh...

01:13:33.592 --> 01:13:35.361
we're looking for our kids.

01:13:35.511 --> 01:13:37.830
Oh!
- Do you have a permission slip?

01:13:37.980 --> 01:13:40.983
There's been a bereavement.
Their grandmother. Horrible accident.

01:13:41.133 --> 01:13:44.003
Okay, well, I can't really
release the kids without...

01:13:44.153 --> 01:13:47.856
We spoke to, uh... Phyllis.
- Guys, uh, just... stay here...

01:13:48.006 --> 01:13:49.441
You're hurting my arm!

01:13:49.591 --> 01:13:51.994
Stop whining, son,
and pick up the pace.

01:13:52.144 --> 01:13:53.646
Stop!

01:13:53.796 --> 01:13:55.531
You need permission!

01:13:57.533 --> 01:14:00.436
Go, go, go, go, go!

01:14:05.174 --> 01:14:08.644
Is there a key for this?
- I'll get the keys. - Alright.

01:14:08.794 --> 01:14:10.562
Hi!

01:14:10.712 --> 01:14:13.666
Honey. Okay, look, the, uh...

01:14:13.816 --> 01:14:17.553
that book
is a gross exaggeration.

01:14:17.703 --> 01:14:19.071
It's a pack of lies.
- Yep.

01:14:19.221 --> 01:14:23.692
Not all of it.
- When did you plan on telling us the truth?

01:14:23.842 --> 01:14:25.010
I tried to.

01:14:25.160 --> 01:14:27.413
When?
- The day you left.

01:14:27.563 --> 01:14:31.225
You said you were horny and needed some brew.
- Something about the Dutch.

01:14:31.375 --> 01:14:34.415
What? No. I said this is all a mistake;
I love you with all my heart.

01:14:34.565 --> 01:14:37.606
That's not what you said.
- I remember exactly what your mother said.

01:14:37.756 --> 01:14:40.092
She said,
"We... we lied to you.

01:14:40.242 --> 01:14:42.428
I'm sorry
and I love you very much."

01:14:42.578 --> 01:14:47.649
Who cares, okay?
You lied to us and used us for 13 years.

01:14:47.799 --> 01:14:50.152
It wasn't a lie.
It didn't feel like a lie, did it?

01:14:50.302 --> 01:14:52.955
It does now.
- Okay, look, look.

01:14:53.105 --> 01:14:55.524
Yes, we...

01:14:57.226 --> 01:15:00.504
...we made a mistake, okay?
But we did it with love.

01:15:00.654 --> 01:15:03.932
I mean, we-we-we always wanted
the best for you. Always.

01:15:04.082 --> 01:15:06.452
Yes.
- Everything was for you.

01:15:06.602 --> 01:15:08.654
No, it wasn't, okay?
You're not us.

01:15:08.804 --> 01:15:13.909
You don't know what it's like for us to
have parents like you, okay? You don't.

01:15:14.059 --> 01:15:15.728
Mr. and Mrs. Morin?

01:15:15.878 --> 01:15:18.063
I'm sorry, but we're gonna
have to open the door.

01:15:18.213 --> 01:15:21.183
Oh, God, could you just please stop
it with the Gestapo bullshit?!

01:15:21.333 --> 01:15:23.001
Okay, please come out.

01:15:23.151 --> 01:15:26.255
Okay, that's...
- Okay. You let go.

01:15:26.405 --> 01:15:27.956
Okay, okay.
- Alright.

01:15:28.106 --> 01:15:29.508
Guys?

01:15:29.658 --> 01:15:31.693
Guys? Okay,
you're gonna come with me.

01:15:31.843 --> 01:15:33.579
No, no,
don't pull her like that!

01:15:33.729 --> 01:15:35.414
Alright, alright, alright.
- Please come on.

01:15:35.564 --> 01:15:38.267
Hey, don't you touch me!
- Ma'am, you have to leave.

01:15:38.417 --> 01:15:40.802
You have to leave.
- What is this, a...

01:15:40.952 --> 01:15:43.105
Ma'am.
- Don't... touch me!

01:15:43.255 --> 01:15:45.274
Please, can you leave?

01:15:47.809 --> 01:15:49.061
Ma'am.
- I'm sorry.

01:15:49.211 --> 01:15:51.563
Hey, guys, get back.
- I can walk, okay?

01:15:51.713 --> 01:15:54.983
I know how to walk.
Is this a fucking school or a jail?

01:15:55.133 --> 01:15:56.885
What did I say? Come on!

01:16:12.668 --> 01:16:14.202
Follow me.

01:16:47.970 --> 01:16:51.106
Muchas gracias!

01:16:52.708 --> 01:16:54.893
Again, thank you all for coming.

01:16:55.043 --> 01:16:57.821
Now, before I sign
all your books for you,

01:16:57.971 --> 01:17:00.749
I've got a little treat.
Is Andre about?

01:17:00.899 --> 01:17:03.652
Ah.

01:17:06.188 --> 01:17:08.056
Okay, Andre.

01:17:09.057 --> 01:17:11.710
Don't be nervous now.

01:17:11.860 --> 01:17:14.671
I read your book.
Well, the blurb.

01:17:14.821 --> 01:17:17.483
Mariachi!

01:17:17.633 --> 01:17:20.702
Gracias...

01:17:24.106 --> 01:17:27.226
Gertz's injury
resulted in a deviated septum

01:17:27.376 --> 01:17:32.080
and, as you know,
if you've ever had your septum deviated,

01:17:32.230 --> 01:17:34.983
it can be
a pretty painful ordeal.

01:17:36.385 --> 01:17:39.988
Phyllis! Get back here!
I'm sorry.

01:17:42.257 --> 01:17:46.795
After 51 years of loyal
service to the Gertz family...

01:17:47.929 --> 01:17:52.300
... I, too, decided to write
a new chapter in my life.

01:17:54.703 --> 01:17:58.073
Gertz pressed charges
and Ben was convicted

01:17:58.223 --> 01:18:01.343
of assault causing
bodily harm.

01:18:03.111 --> 01:18:05.113
You're in, boy.

01:18:05.263 --> 01:18:06.848
Over here!

01:18:08.984 --> 01:18:12.788
Surprisingly, incarceration was a
very positive experience for Ben.

01:18:14.823 --> 01:18:16.324
Oof!

01:18:19.428 --> 01:18:21.863
Good work, man. Let's go.

01:18:26.101 --> 01:18:28.461
Well,
I've visited regularly enough

01:18:28.611 --> 01:18:30.972
to know that Ben
is a devoted father.

01:18:31.122 --> 01:18:32.291
After only five weeks,

01:18:32.441 --> 01:18:35.794
and thanks in part
to my testimony,

01:18:35.944 --> 01:18:39.281
Ben earned early release
for good behaviour.

01:18:39.431 --> 01:18:42.084
...respect instilled
self-confidence...

01:18:42.234 --> 01:18:43.635
Upon the parole board
determining

01:18:43.785 --> 01:18:46.421
that it is in the best interest
of the accused,

01:18:46.571 --> 01:18:48.240
and not contrary
to the public interest,

01:18:48.390 --> 01:18:51.193
the board orders that the
accused be granted a discharge

01:18:51.343 --> 01:18:54.262
that is conditional
to successfully completing

01:18:54.412 --> 01:18:57.816
a period of probation
of six months.

01:18:57.966 --> 01:19:00.510
This proposed decision...
- Over the years,

01:19:00.660 --> 01:19:03.205
I became very fond
of the Morin family.

01:19:03.355 --> 01:19:05.857
Ben is good people.

01:19:06.007 --> 01:19:08.443
... Section 84-32,
subdivision...

01:19:09.978 --> 01:19:11.788
As spring unfolded,

01:19:11.938 --> 01:19:13.599
Luke, Maurice and Maya

01:19:13.749 --> 01:19:17.352
requested to see
their parents.

01:19:19.988 --> 01:19:21.840
Ben.

01:19:21.990 --> 01:19:23.892
Hey.
- Hey.

01:19:29.831 --> 01:19:32.901
If you can't get rid
of the family skeleton,

01:19:33.051 --> 01:19:35.020
you may as well make it dance.

01:19:35.170 --> 01:19:37.839
Simon & Garfunkel?
- George Bernard Shaw.

01:19:37.989 --> 01:19:39.541
Enjoy the show!

01:19:42.310 --> 01:19:44.913
Okay.

01:20:04.499 --> 01:20:06.835
Why would you do that?

01:20:16.344 --> 01:20:19.948
Mom! Dad! I missed you.
- Hey, guys.

01:20:23.051 --> 01:20:24.369
Look at you.

01:20:24.519 --> 01:20:28.290
We're glad you're here.
- Yeah, come check it out.

01:20:41.002 --> 01:20:43.438
