00:21.614 --> 00:23.291
Dad, don't forget monkey brains.

00:23.321 --> 00:25.468
Yeah, and we need
more unicorn testicles.

00:25.498 --> 00:27.276
That's where dreams are born.

00:27.306 --> 00:29.503
All right, we'll get those, then
head back to the restaurant.

00:29.533 --> 00:31.663
I just need fresh kale
for the burger of the day...

00:31.693 --> 00:32.919
"If Looks Could Kale."

00:32.949 --> 00:34.878
Ha!

00:34.908 --> 00:36.244
Hey, Reggie,
I didn't know you guys

00:36.274 --> 00:37.593
shopped here
for your restaurants.

00:37.623 --> 00:38.880
What happened, Pepe?

00:38.910 --> 00:40.470
And why is your face
painted like a cat?

00:40.500 --> 00:41.727
I lost my restaurant.

00:41.757 --> 00:42.965
We're trying to cheer him up.

00:42.995 --> 00:44.238
I'm a kitty. I'm a kitty.

00:44.268 --> 00:45.510
You didn't read the review?

00:45.540 --> 00:47.754
Three weeks after
the Moody Foody's

00:47.784 --> 00:50.734
hatchet job, Pepe's taco joint
is a yoga studio.

00:50.764 --> 00:52.242
A hot yoga studio.

00:52.272 --> 00:54.486
I bet, when it heats up,
it smells like taco meat.

00:54.516 --> 00:55.959
Like my underwear.

00:55.989 --> 00:57.616
The Moody Foody's on a rampage.

00:57.646 --> 00:59.324
He nitpicks
every little thing, Bob.

00:59.354 --> 01:01.099
He said my bread was stale.

01:01.129 --> 01:02.774
Well, it is pretty stale,
Reggie.

01:02.804 --> 01:04.447
That's 'cause I buy
day-old bread!

01:04.477 --> 01:05.687
Okay. Okay.

01:05.717 --> 01:07.026
I've been mapping

01:07.056 --> 01:08.534
the Moody Foody's
patterns for months.

01:08.564 --> 01:11.247
He follows a precise
ethnic sequence in restaurants:

01:11.277 --> 01:13.523
Asian, European,
Latin, American.

01:13.553 --> 01:15.198
Like Larry King with his wives.

01:15.228 --> 01:17.441
Man, you guys
are obsessed with this critic.

01:17.471 --> 01:18.931
You should be, too!

01:18.961 --> 01:21.176
According to my calculations,
you're next.

01:21.206 --> 01:23.453
Um... okay, that's fine.

01:23.483 --> 01:25.260
For all you know, he's
already reviewed you.

01:25.290 --> 01:27.036
He's a master of disguise.

01:27.066 --> 01:29.163
Yeah, when he reviewed my place,

01:29.193 --> 01:31.004
he was dressed like a
construction worker.

01:31.034 --> 01:32.879
For me, he was
an E.R. doctor.

01:32.909 --> 01:34.353
Park ranger.

01:34.383 --> 01:36.630
But listen, Bob,
the guy's got a tell.

01:36.660 --> 01:38.841
Before every meal,
he wipes his hands

01:38.871 --> 01:41.016
with a blue handkerchief.
Blue.

01:41.046 --> 01:43.696
Watch for that, Bob... blue.
(WHIMPERS)

01:43.726 --> 01:45.438
Here you go... $30.

01:45.468 --> 01:46.911
What? No, I didn't
ask for these.

01:46.941 --> 01:48.468
Nobody asks.

01:48.498 --> 01:50.276
- You describe it, you buy it.
- Oh, look.

01:50.306 --> 01:52.453
- He even got the hanky.
- TINA: Can you draw me

01:52.483 --> 01:54.865
- on a horse with a zombie riding behind me?
- No.

01:54.895 --> 01:56.471
Draw a picture
of my dad's moustache

01:56.501 --> 01:58.481
really giving it
to a caterpillar.

01:58.511 --> 02:00.607
No, don't do that.
Do it! Do it! Do it!

02:00.637 --> 02:01.980
Hold on to these sketches, Bob.

02:02.010 --> 02:03.755
They could save your restaurant.

02:03.785 --> 02:05.698
Uh, Tran, my restaurant
will be fine.

02:05.728 --> 02:07.171
After all,
Reggie's bread is stale.

02:07.201 --> 02:08.845
And, Pepe,

02:08.875 --> 02:10.554
your carne asada
isn't even beef.

02:10.584 --> 02:12.194
Carne asada is beef?

02:12.224 --> 02:13.500
And Tran's noodles are...

02:13.530 --> 02:14.873
So what?
I reuse my noodles.

02:14.903 --> 02:16.213
If people don't eat them all,

02:16.243 --> 02:17.754
I'm supposed to just waste them?

02:17.784 --> 02:19.360
It's just, no offence, fellas,

02:19.390 --> 02:21.007
but I use fresh ingredients,
so, you know,

02:21.037 --> 02:22.716
I should be all right
if this critic comes.

02:22.746 --> 02:24.015
Offence taken.

02:24.045 --> 02:25.774
Here's you on a horse
with a zombie.

02:25.804 --> 02:27.415
50 dollars.

02:27.445 --> 02:30.060
Dad, pay the man.
No, $50... for that?

02:30.090 --> 02:33.057
$50... it's a little girl,
a horse and a zombie.

02:33.087 --> 02:34.988
Dad, that's so cheap for
what you're getting.

02:36.671 --> 02:38.281
Look, if the critic comes,
it's just

02:38.311 --> 02:40.157
- another customer, you know?
- I know.

02:40.187 --> 02:42.317
Just a customer
who can shut us down

02:42.347 --> 02:44.125
with one bad review...
that's all.

02:44.155 --> 02:45.531
I know he can destroy us, Lin.

02:45.561 --> 02:47.039
I don't need a pep talk.

02:47.069 --> 02:49.450
And if I did, this would
be a horrible pep talk.

02:49.480 --> 02:50.940
It's him, Dad.

02:50.970 --> 02:52.246
It's the Moody Foody.

02:52.276 --> 02:54.691
BOB: Gene, that's
Mike the Mailman.

02:54.721 --> 02:57.068
You've seen him every day
for the past five years.

02:57.098 --> 02:58.576
It's the long con.

02:58.606 --> 02:59.932
It's him.

02:59.962 --> 03:01.723
Tina, that's Gene.
Long con.

03:01.753 --> 03:02.963
Thanks, Mike.

03:02.993 --> 03:04.704
Yeah, thanks, "Mike."

03:04.734 --> 03:06.468
I cannot hear you.

03:08.199 --> 03:09.794
That's got to be
the food critic.

03:09.824 --> 03:11.401
A Civil War re-enactor?

03:11.431 --> 03:13.879
Ah, can't stand all
that drab Gray.

03:13.909 --> 03:15.219
No wonder they lost.

03:15.249 --> 03:16.492
All right, keep an eye out

03:16.522 --> 03:17.664
for the blue handkerchief.

03:17.694 --> 03:19.037
("DIXIE" RINGTONE PLAYS)

03:19.067 --> 03:20.443
Hello?

03:20.473 --> 03:22.285
You're really sorry?

03:22.315 --> 03:24.361
Okay, I'll...
I'll come do the battle.

03:24.391 --> 03:27.460
For the record,
the buttons are authentic.

03:29.715 --> 03:31.193
All right, everyone,
back to work.

03:31.223 --> 03:32.867
We're not going
to stand around and wait

03:32.897 --> 03:35.549
for a food critic who may
or may not ever show up.

03:37.636 --> 03:40.252
Dad, Dad, another
Civil War re-enactor is here.

03:40.282 --> 03:42.445
He must be fighting
for the North.

03:42.475 --> 03:43.617
BOB:
It's a Hasidic Jew, Gene.

03:43.647 --> 03:45.147
You know that.

Blue hanky!
Blue hanky!

03:49.255 --> 03:50.549

Blue hanky?

03:50.579 --> 03:52.290
Yes, blue hanky!
That's the Moody Foody!

03:52.320 --> 03:53.814
(GASPS) Blue hanky!
Blue hanky!

03:53.844 --> 03:55.773
- Right there... blue hanky!
- Aah! Hanky panky!

- Blue hanky right there! Blue hanky!
- GENE: Hanky panky!

03:57.494 --> 03:59.138
Quick, circumcise Gene.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:59.168 --> 04:00.848
Circumcise me! Circumcise me!
Quick, quick!

04:03.544 --> 04:05.424
Okay, the Moody Foody
is here in our restaurant.

04:05.455 --> 04:06.963
This is happening now.

04:06.993 --> 04:08.504
Do you need a diversion?
I'll scream.

04:08.534 --> 04:10.412
Cockroach!
Gene.

04:10.442 --> 04:11.719
Let's bribe him.

04:11.749 --> 04:13.024
Dad, take out the lettuce

04:13.054 --> 04:14.933
and replace it with
this $20 bill.

04:14.963 --> 04:16.541
That I took out of your wallet.

04:16.571 --> 04:18.115
Oh, or tape it to his back.

04:18.144 --> 04:19.721
That's not how
a bribe works, Tina.

04:19.752 --> 04:20.928
(MUFFLED):
Yes, it is!

04:20.958 --> 04:22.569
Now, everybody
calm down, all right?

04:22.599 --> 04:25.113
We just do what we do...
we give him a delicious meal,

04:25.143 --> 04:26.821
we get a positive review,
and that's that.

04:26.851 --> 04:28.563
Yeah, 'cause if we don't,
it's curtains.

04:28.593 --> 04:30.472
We're done.
Lin, stop pep-talking!

04:30.502 --> 04:32.222
- Wha...?
- Let's just take a deep breath...

04:32.252 --> 04:33.653
(SIGHS HEAVILY)

04:37.802 --> 04:39.201
She's out taking
the critic's order.

04:39.231 --> 04:40.317
No, no, no.

04:40.347 --> 04:42.561
Time for the charm bomb
to explode.

04:42.591 --> 04:43.867
Hi there, customer.

04:43.897 --> 04:45.073
Is someone hungry?

04:45.103 --> 04:46.847
That's why I'm here.

04:46.877 --> 04:48.254
Are you ready to order?

04:48.284 --> 04:49.593
Uh, yeah.

04:49.623 --> 04:52.205
I just need another second.

04:52.235 --> 04:53.880
Are you just
going to stand there

04:53.910 --> 04:55.119
and stare at me?

04:55.149 --> 04:56.459
Uh-huh.

Oh, God.

we could talk about.

Oh, God, Lin, go get Louise.

05:06.819 --> 05:08.330
All right, all right, all right.

05:14.187 --> 05:16.099
How we... (BELCHES)

05:16.129 --> 05:17.807
doing today?

05:17.837 --> 05:19.783
The food here is so delicious.

05:19.813 --> 05:21.424
I'm a customer.

05:21.454 --> 05:23.667
Try the pad Thai.
Mmm.

05:23.697 --> 05:25.537
Okay, everyone, great job.
Back in the kitchen.

05:26.528 --> 05:28.406
Sorry about all that.

05:28.436 --> 05:30.650
Um, I'd like to recommend
the burger of the day...

05:30.680 --> 05:33.128
the "If Looks Could
Kale" burger.

05:33.158 --> 05:34.434
(CHUCKLING)

05:34.464 --> 05:36.074
Uh, you get it?

05:36.104 --> 05:37.750
- Mm-hmm.
- Uh, well, you're not laughing.

05:37.780 --> 05:39.223
I don't think you got it.

05:39.253 --> 05:41.333
"If Looks Could Kale."
Yeah, I-I got it.

05:41.363 --> 05:43.643
(SIGHS) I'll have
a cheeseburger.

05:43.673 --> 05:45.451
Coming right up.

05:45.481 --> 05:48.448
(WHISPERING):
That guy's creeping me out.

05:48.478 --> 05:50.089
Okay, it got a little
rocky out there,

05:50.119 --> 05:51.412
but we righted the ship.

05:51.442 --> 05:53.204
I set it up, you knock it down.

05:53.234 --> 05:54.460
Right, Dad?

05:54.490 --> 05:56.051
Yeah... right.

05:56.081 --> 05:57.256
Thanks, Tina.

05:57.286 --> 05:58.596
Smooth sailing.

05:58.626 --> 06:00.103
Just like every day.

06:00.133 --> 06:01.911
So, well, what kind of
burger did he order?

06:01.941 --> 06:03.753
Crap.

06:03.783 --> 06:06.532
So, I know we discussed
having the burger of the day,

06:06.562 --> 06:09.345
but I want to say you
didn't want that.

06:09.375 --> 06:11.287
Where did we land,
uh, in the end?

06:11.317 --> 06:12.795
You seriously don't remember?

06:12.825 --> 06:14.335
No, I do.

06:14.365 --> 06:16.545
Um... cheeseburger.

06:16.575 --> 06:18.001
Just remembered.

06:18.031 --> 06:19.274
I just remembered on my own.

06:19.304 --> 06:21.066
- Cheeseburger!
- GENE: Got it.

06:21.096 --> 06:22.824
GENE: Uh-oh! Oh, God.

06:22.854 --> 06:23.863
GENE:
Aah!

06:23.893 --> 06:25.604
That's just the 3:00 fire.

06:25.634 --> 06:27.513
Your burger may take
an extra minute.

06:27.543 --> 06:29.422
In the meantime, enjoy the show.

06:29.452 --> 06:31.386
Gene!

06:33.269 --> 06:34.478
Oof.

06:34.508 --> 06:35.616
Ugh.
(GROANS)

06:35.646 --> 06:37.291
"Overdone and dry."

06:37.321 --> 06:39.033
It's like, uh, "above
and beyond," right?

06:39.063 --> 06:41.042
(GROANS)
It's not bad.

06:41.072 --> 06:42.649
What about "insufferable"?
What's that?

06:42.679 --> 06:44.223
Maybe that just means
he didn't suffer.

06:44.253 --> 06:45.864
That's good news.

06:45.894 --> 06:47.639
I've seen some murders
in my line of work,

06:47.669 --> 06:48.979
but what a hit job.

06:49.009 --> 06:50.385
Wait, here's something good.

06:50.415 --> 06:52.093
"The best part
of the meal was..."

"Continued on page 45."

"was the napkin
I spat my food into.

06:58.016 --> 06:59.393
Thank you, little napkin."

06:59.423 --> 07:00.632
Oh.

07:00.662 --> 07:01.871
This is my fault.

07:01.901 --> 07:03.144
I screwed up the burger.

07:03.174 --> 07:04.685
It's my fault.

07:04.715 --> 07:06.091
So it's settled.

07:06.121 --> 07:07.497
Wait a minute.
You screwed up.

07:07.527 --> 07:09.322
And you and you.

07:09.352 --> 07:10.946
All right,
stop the finger-pointing.

07:10.976 --> 07:12.303
(SIGHS) I'm sorry.

07:12.333 --> 07:13.977
I... sometimes
I forget how horrible

07:14.007 --> 07:15.250
you all are at your jobs.

07:15.280 --> 07:16.991
You're all horrible!

07:17.021 --> 07:18.699
Sorry. I mean,
you are horrible,

07:18.729 --> 07:20.340
but I shouldn't
have said it so loud.

07:20.370 --> 07:21.880
All right, okay.

07:21.910 --> 07:23.488
That's enough of the papers.
But you are!

07:23.518 --> 07:25.698
Okay, okay, enough. Stop...

07:25.728 --> 07:27.038
How bad could everybody be?!

07:27.068 --> 07:28.276
Stop the yelling.

07:28.306 --> 07:29.549
Who cares about one bad review?

07:29.579 --> 07:30.856
Don't be such a baby.

07:30.886 --> 07:32.931
Come, come, come.

07:32.961 --> 07:34.774
This is one of my vacant spaces.

07:34.804 --> 07:36.415
It used to be a
burger restaurant.

07:36.445 --> 07:37.754
Hi, Bob.

07:37.784 --> 07:39.897
Hey, Mr. Fish.
How are you?

07:39.927 --> 07:42.944
Hi, Mrs. Burger. Good.

07:42.974 --> 07:45.188
Uh, Mr. Fischoeder, this
is still a burger restaurant.

07:45.218 --> 07:48.303
Yeah, let us die slowly
in peace, you vulture.

07:48.333 --> 07:50.144
Right you are.

07:50.174 --> 07:52.555
One bad review won't sink
the SS Bob, will it?

07:52.585 --> 07:54.028
You're like a benign tumour.

07:54.058 --> 07:56.240
With a little bit
of hair and teeth.

07:56.270 --> 07:57.612
I'm like a tumour with teeth?

07:57.642 --> 07:59.086
Sounds cute.

07:59.116 --> 08:00.559
Yes, little man.
It's a compliment.

08:00.589 --> 08:01.832
Let's come back in a week.

08:01.862 --> 08:03.172
It should be empty by then.

08:03.202 --> 08:04.561
Don't worry, Bobby.

08:04.591 --> 08:05.950
People can make up
their own minds.

08:05.980 --> 08:07.206
You'd be surprised.

08:07.236 --> 08:08.646
They don't need some critic.

08:08.676 --> 08:10.196
As long as we get
Michelin-recommended,

08:10.226 --> 08:11.309
we'll be fine.

08:11.339 --> 08:13.206
Order up.

08:15.458 --> 08:16.969
(GROANING)
What?

08:16.999 --> 08:18.710
What? Something wrong
with the burger?

08:18.740 --> 08:20.351
No, uh, it's fine.

08:20.381 --> 08:21.860
It's just...
maybe you missed the mark

08:21.890 --> 08:23.264
with this one, is all, you know?

08:23.294 --> 08:24.536
What?

08:24.566 --> 08:25.776
What do you mean, Teddy?

08:25.806 --> 08:26.981
I don't know, Bobby.

08:27.011 --> 08:28.388
Just tastes a little...

08:28.418 --> 08:30.029
overdone and dry or something.

08:30.059 --> 08:32.908
Overdone and dry, Teddy?
You're just quoting the review.

08:32.938 --> 08:35.654
No, I know. It's just, now I
have words to put to my tastes.

08:35.683 --> 08:37.530
Will you get a mind
of your own, Teddy?

08:37.559 --> 08:39.941
I mean, seriously...
with your dead eyes!

08:39.971 --> 08:41.381
What? My eyes
aren't dead.

08:41.410 --> 08:42.988
He's not dead.
No, I'm fine.

08:43.018 --> 08:44.763
And you, Mort.

08:44.793 --> 08:46.740
- What did I... what did I do?
- Whatever! (SIGHS)

08:46.770 --> 08:48.715
Lin, this review
is going to be the end of us.

08:48.745 --> 08:50.892
- People think we're terrible now.
- Not terrible.

08:50.922 --> 08:52.197
We're not terrible.

08:52.227 --> 08:53.404
Bobby, you know that.

08:53.434 --> 08:54.977
Look at me.

08:55.007 --> 08:56.350
I know that,
but it doesn't matter.

08:56.380 --> 08:57.723
We have one crappy day,

08:57.753 --> 08:59.397
and then everybody reads
about it,

08:59.427 --> 09:01.273
and now that's what
they think... forever.

09:01.303 --> 09:02.586
MAN: Hey, how
about this place?

09:06.410 --> 09:08.356
Oh, yeah? Well, your
haircut's overdone and dry!

09:08.386 --> 09:11.771
And you, your pants
are overdone and dry!

09:11.801 --> 09:13.011
Look at your dumb face!

09:13.041 --> 09:14.317
It's overdone and dry!

09:14.347 --> 09:15.957
Get back here, people!

09:15.987 --> 09:17.967
Where are you going?
I want to review you

09:17.997 --> 09:20.311
- Yeah!
- I'm going to review everyone!

09:20.341 --> 09:21.768
You're getting it!
Overdone and dry!

09:21.798 --> 09:23.174
Overdone and dry!
Overdone and dry!

09:23.204 --> 09:24.563
Overdone and dry!
Overdone and dry!

09:24.593 --> 09:25.693
Overdone and dry!

09:28.335 --> 09:30.884
"Two thumbs down...
my throat."

09:30.914 --> 09:32.391
(CHUCKLES)
That's just rude.

09:32.421 --> 09:34.366
Put it down, Bobby.
Just stop. Enough.

09:34.396 --> 09:35.589
Attaboy.

09:35.619 --> 09:36.878
Good day, sir.

09:36.908 --> 09:38.686
Good day, Louise.

09:38.716 --> 09:40.226
Actually, you've
had better days.

09:40.256 --> 09:41.851
That's why we're here.

09:41.881 --> 09:44.362
We're the PR firm
of Cooper, Molyneux and Juarez.

09:44.392 --> 09:46.472
Wait. What happened
to Belcher?

09:46.502 --> 09:47.879
Recent events have left

09:47.909 --> 09:49.754
the name, Belcher,
badly tarnished.

09:49.784 --> 09:51.027
Tina?
Here's Dad's image

09:51.057 --> 09:52.668
before the review.

09:52.698 --> 09:54.097
Here's Dad's image
after the review.

09:54.127 --> 09:55.330
Rock bottom.

09:55.360 --> 09:57.607
Aw. They made
a poster, Bobby.

09:57.637 --> 09:59.097
Uh, you guys were there, too...

09:59.127 --> 10:00.566
remember?
Destroying our business.

10:00.596 --> 10:02.078
Hey, hey, hey.

10:02.108 --> 10:04.857
Um, I'm pretty sure
I was in Sausalito that day.

10:04.887 --> 10:06.699
I'm pretty sure
you weren't, Gene!

10:06.729 --> 10:09.529
All right, all right, let's
stop blaming and start gaming.

10:09.559 --> 10:12.207
Our firm specialises
in image rehabilitation.

10:12.237 --> 10:14.116
This is our
Basic Image Cleaner Package.

10:14.146 --> 10:15.423
Lunch is included.

10:15.453 --> 10:17.097
GENE: Our Bad Boy
Robot Package

10:17.127 --> 10:18.973
comes with a boob job.

10:19.003 --> 10:20.580
Lunch not included.

10:20.610 --> 10:22.290
Your father doesn't need
his image cleaned.

10:22.320 --> 10:23.728
He's not a celebrity.

10:23.758 --> 10:25.101
Dad's a local celebrity.

10:25.131 --> 10:26.440
Like Eyebrow Man.

10:26.470 --> 10:27.981
Remember before
his eyebrows grew out

10:28.011 --> 10:29.538
and he was just Parrot Man?

10:29.568 --> 10:30.851
I hate that parrot.

10:32.063 --> 10:33.372
Hi, parrot.

10:33.402 --> 10:34.779
(SQUAWKS)
Nerd alert!

10:34.809 --> 10:36.151
What?

10:36.181 --> 10:37.625
No one knows
about peoples' bad days

10:37.655 --> 10:38.981
in other professions.

10:39.011 --> 10:41.309
None of these jobs
get reviewed by critics.

10:41.339 --> 10:43.318
I.T. support?
That doesn't get reviewed.

10:43.348 --> 10:45.260
Sales analyst, not reviewed.

10:45.290 --> 10:47.052
Stop torturing yourself.

10:47.082 --> 10:49.363
You know what, take
off your cranky pants

10:49.393 --> 10:51.891
and go take a nap, all right?

10:51.921 --> 10:54.067
Accounts receivable specialist.

10:54.097 --> 10:56.463
What's that? Sounds great.

10:56.493 --> 10:58.744
I bet that job
never gets reviewed.

11:05.148 --> 11:07.530
â™ª Bup-bup-bup-bow, bup-bup-bow â™ª

11:07.560 --> 11:09.506
â™ª Bup-bup-
bup-bow-bup-bup-bow! â™ª

11:09.536 --> 11:10.829
(LAUGHS)
I love this song.

11:10.859 --> 11:12.989
Sam my man from Uzbekistan!

11:13.019 --> 11:14.686
You got the Bob in the house!

11:16.551 --> 11:18.819
A lot of e-mails.
Mostly spam.

11:20.118 --> 11:21.830
What is that, ramen?

11:21.860 --> 11:23.068
Tea.
Oh.

11:23.098 --> 11:25.245
I thought it was ramen.
No. Tea.

11:25.275 --> 11:26.551
Hey, what are we talking about?

11:26.581 --> 11:27.958
I thought Kathy was
making ramen.

11:27.988 --> 11:29.398
For some reason, I saw noodles.

11:29.428 --> 11:31.039
Nope, just tea.
Huh.

11:31.069 --> 11:33.583
(GROANING)

11:33.613 --> 11:35.660
(AIR HISSING)

11:35.690 --> 11:37.129
(HUSHED):
Hey, it's Jason's birthday.

11:37.159 --> 11:38.573
Did you sign the card?

11:38.603 --> 11:39.813
(WHISPERS):
Not yet.

11:39.843 --> 11:42.040
Oh, here.
To the J-man.

11:42.070 --> 11:43.245
(GROANS)

11:43.275 --> 11:45.120
It's good cake.

11:45.150 --> 11:46.493
My wife made it.

11:46.523 --> 11:48.251
(A LA BORAT):
My wife!

11:48.281 --> 11:49.709
(ALL LAUGH)

11:49.739 --> 11:51.098
Borat!

11:51.128 --> 11:52.405
Hey, do it again!

11:52.435 --> 11:54.112
Jeff, get in here!
You got to hear this!

11:54.142 --> 11:55.652
My wife!

11:55.682 --> 11:56.992
Yes!

11:57.022 --> 11:58.867
No!

11:58.897 --> 12:01.329
26, 27, 28,

12:01.359 --> 12:02.970
29, 30, 35...

12:03.000 --> 12:04.611
Linda, kids,

12:04.641 --> 12:06.854
napkin holder,
ice cream machine!

12:06.884 --> 12:08.680
Oh, come here!

12:08.710 --> 12:11.007
Dirty spot on the counter
that I can never get out!

12:11.037 --> 12:13.853
Get over here! I love you.

12:13.883 --> 12:15.259
What the hell is wrong with you?

12:15.289 --> 12:16.700
I had a nightmare, Lin.

12:16.730 --> 12:17.989
I worked in an office.

12:18.019 --> 12:19.747
I had to sign a birthday card.

12:19.777 --> 12:21.656
Don't touch me.
You're all sweaty.

12:21.686 --> 12:24.134
- I hate signing birthday cards.
- You sign ours.

12:24.164 --> 12:26.077
Actually, your mother
does it for me.

12:26.107 --> 12:27.182
Oh.
Sorry.

12:27.212 --> 12:28.555
Like we read those things.

12:28.585 --> 12:30.028
Where's the money?
(CHUCKLES)

12:30.058 --> 12:32.506
You know, I realised
I'm not a cubicle guy.

12:32.536 --> 12:33.913
I can't do it.

12:33.943 --> 12:35.386
I can't do anything
other than this.

12:35.416 --> 12:37.161
Yeah, look at you.

12:37.191 --> 12:39.471
If this restaurant fails,
I'm gonna kill myself.

12:39.501 --> 12:42.184
- There he is, that's the spirit.
- Yup.

12:42.214 --> 12:44.328
- You should ask for a redo.
- A what?

12:44.358 --> 12:46.939
A redo. One time, to get out
of a Spanish test,

12:46.969 --> 12:49.049
Kelly Mathis forced
herself to throw up.

12:49.079 --> 12:51.125
I mean, vomite.
Hmm.

12:51.155 --> 12:53.570
Then another time,
to get out of a math test,

12:53.600 --> 12:55.040
she forced herself
to get her period.

12:55.070 --> 12:56.349
That's how she got a redo.

12:56.379 --> 12:58.125
A redo!
That's genius!

12:58.155 --> 12:59.363
We'll get our period!

12:59.393 --> 13:01.573
No, a redo.
No, period!

13:01.603 --> 13:03.298
I'm gonna walk over

13:03.328 --> 13:05.173
to the Moody Foody's house
and cook him dinner!

13:05.203 --> 13:07.635
Wine him, dine him, 59 him, Dad!

13:07.665 --> 13:08.673
That's right, Gene!

13:08.703 --> 13:10.464
(GROWLS)
Thank you, Tina.

13:10.494 --> 13:13.563
This time I'm gonna make the
Moody Foody a great burger.

13:13.593 --> 13:15.638
All right!
If you think that's

13:15.668 --> 13:18.183
the right move,
I trust ya... kinda.

13:18.213 --> 13:20.126
Chant me out!

13:20.156 --> 13:23.073
KIDS:
Redo! Redo! Redo! Redo!

13:23.103 --> 13:25.271
Let's go watch this train wreck.

13:27.858 --> 13:32.261
ALL: Stalking Dad quietly!
Stalking Dad quietly!

13:36.933 --> 13:40.252
Oh, well, well, well,

13:40.282 --> 13:42.496
the guy who couldn't remember
my order finds my address?

13:42.526 --> 13:44.204
How'd you manage that?

13:44.234 --> 13:45.777
Well, let's just say

13:45.807 --> 13:47.527
some of my fellow disgruntled
restaurateurs

13:47.558 --> 13:49.261
have been dump sacking
your house.

13:49.291 --> 13:51.940
Oh, yes, the flaming
bags of poop.

13:51.970 --> 13:54.284
But I'm not here to do that,
all right?

13:54.314 --> 13:56.460
I-I came here to cook you
another burger.

13:56.490 --> 13:58.637
Oh, well that's so Ni...
I'd rather be dump sacked.

13:58.667 --> 14:02.254
Listen, I know your Bob's
Burgers experience was subpar.

14:02.284 --> 14:03.795
I just want a redo.

14:03.825 --> 14:05.469
Of course you do.
Great!

14:05.499 --> 14:07.219
Let's get started then.
Where's the kitchen?

14:07.249 --> 14:08.064
Ah!
What is that?!

14:08.094 --> 14:09.437
It's a Taser!

14:09.467 --> 14:11.379
Ow! That stings!

14:11.409 --> 14:13.087
What is that supposed to do?

14:13.117 --> 14:15.297
It's supposed
to incapacitate you.

14:15.327 --> 14:16.905
I'm gonna send in a bad review.

14:16.935 --> 14:19.416
I am... not shocked. Hey!

14:19.446 --> 14:21.242
Oh, oh, I'm calling the police!

14:21.272 --> 14:22.715
Don't, don't. Wait!

14:22.745 --> 14:25.746
I just want to cook you dinner!

14:25.776 --> 14:27.889
I just want you
to try my burger, okay?

14:27.919 --> 14:30.467
Get off me!

14:30.497 --> 14:32.980
Just let me cook you a burger!

14:33.010 --> 14:34.888
Ow! Ah!
You're biting me!

14:34.918 --> 14:36.412
Ah! Get... Ow!

14:36.442 --> 14:37.902
Stop!

14:37.932 --> 14:40.230
Dad, we felt we should
be here as your PR fir...

14:40.260 --> 14:41.669
Oh, yes!

14:41.699 --> 14:42.942
This doesn't look like a redo.

14:42.972 --> 14:45.140
Tickle fight! Hyah!

14:47.415 --> 14:49.415
Listen, kids, taping people
to chairs is bad, okay?

14:49.446 --> 14:51.270
Never do this.

14:51.300 --> 14:52.927
We're just helping him calm down

14:52.957 --> 14:54.434
so that he can enjoy
this burger.

14:54.464 --> 14:55.740
Bye-bye, frown!

14:55.770 --> 14:57.817
Now it's a smile!

14:57.847 --> 14:59.089
There. Comfy?

14:59.119 --> 15:00.428
(ANGRY GRUNTING)

15:00.458 --> 15:01.668
Good.

15:01.698 --> 15:04.882
This is an old classic of mine.

15:04.912 --> 15:07.628
It's called the "Girls Just
Wanna Have Fennel" burger, huh?

15:07.658 --> 15:09.336
- God.
- Was that a nose laugh, huh?

15:09.366 --> 15:12.049
Ow! No!

15:12.079 --> 15:14.326
- Oh. I laughed, Dad.
- Thanks, Tina.

15:14.356 --> 15:16.034
Yeah, me, too!
Don't tie us up!

15:16.064 --> 15:17.943
Okay, big boy bite.

15:17.973 --> 15:19.131
No, nuh-uh, no.
Not happening.

15:19.161 --> 15:20.420
Uh-huh, uh-huh.
Mm-mm.

15:20.450 --> 15:22.096
All aboard the burger train!

15:22.126 --> 15:24.184
No, I'm not getting on the...
Open up the tunnel.

15:24.214 --> 15:25.394

Mm-mm, mm-mm.

(DOORBELL RINGS)

15:26.462 --> 15:27.671
Are you expecting someone?

15:27.701 --> 15:29.211
Oh, that must be
my next kidnapper.

15:29.241 --> 15:31.254
LINDA:
Bobby, you in there?

15:31.284 --> 15:32.828
Lin?

15:32.858 --> 15:34.670
What are you all doing here?

15:34.700 --> 15:36.076
Linda told us about the redo.

15:36.106 --> 15:37.751
We brought food from
our restaurants.

15:37.781 --> 15:39.526
I brought no food
because that man,

15:39.556 --> 15:41.167
he ruined my restaurant.

15:41.197 --> 15:42.707
So... how's it going?

15:42.737 --> 15:45.453
Uh, not great.
He won't eat my burger.

15:45.483 --> 15:46.927
What?
Well that's just rude.

15:46.957 --> 15:48.450
Linda, wait, don't...

15:48.480 --> 15:51.130
Bobby... (GASPS)
you've taken him hostage?

15:51.160 --> 15:53.641
(CHUCKLES)
No, no. He's in his own home.

15:53.671 --> 15:54.880
"Hostage" is a little much.

15:54.910 --> 15:56.504
It's not that.

15:56.534 --> 15:58.882
No, no, "hostage" sounds
about right.

15:58.912 --> 16:00.791
- Shut up!
- This is dark, Bob. Real dark.

16:00.821 --> 16:03.001
I'll go get the jumper
cables out of my car.

16:03.031 --> 16:04.558
No, no, no, no, no.

16:04.588 --> 16:06.902
This should catch any
blood or bodily fluids.

16:06.932 --> 16:08.577
No blood, no jumper cables.

16:08.607 --> 16:10.050
Yes, jumper cables!

16:10.080 --> 16:11.691
The man Tased you, Dad!

16:11.721 --> 16:13.600
I just want him
to eat my burger.

16:13.630 --> 16:16.379
(GASPS) You Tased my Bobby
and you won't eat his burger?

16:16.409 --> 16:18.874
Well, we'll just see
about that, won't we?

16:18.904 --> 16:21.185
Now all aboard the burger train!

16:21.215 --> 16:23.227
Open up the tunnel, li'l baby!

16:23.257 --> 16:24.835
I tried that already.
Didn't work.

16:24.865 --> 16:26.443
Oh.
We can make him eat.

16:26.473 --> 16:28.686
Oh, goody. Are those
the exact noodles

16:28.716 --> 16:30.260
I didn't finish
three months ago?

16:30.290 --> 16:32.002
No, they are the noodles

16:32.032 --> 16:33.910
somebody didn't finish
yesterday.

16:33.940 --> 16:35.485
So, there!

16:35.515 --> 16:37.594
Oh, yeah?
Well eat this!

16:37.624 --> 16:38.632
Mm-mm! Mm-mm!

16:38.662 --> 16:40.055
Hey, come on!
Come on!

16:40.085 --> 16:41.495
Well, if you won't eat our food,

16:41.525 --> 16:43.387
then choke on
your reviews, huh?!

16:43.417 --> 16:45.932
Does this taste
like enchilad-ass?

16:45.962 --> 16:47.390
ALL:
Eat it! Eat it! Eat it!

16:47.420 --> 16:49.800
Eat your words, all of 'em!

16:49.830 --> 16:51.742
- All right!
- So, Moody, eat the foody.

16:51.772 --> 16:53.082
Guys, stop!

16:53.112 --> 16:54.824
Shove it in there,
you get it in!

16:54.854 --> 16:57.067
Guys! This is crazy.
He's not worth it.

16:57.097 --> 16:59.278
You're right,
no one will miss him.

16:59.308 --> 17:01.119
No, Pepe!
That's not what I meant.

What now?!

17:02.656 --> 17:04.267
He tripped the silent alarm.

17:04.297 --> 17:06.779
Delivery.
I need someone to sign.

17:06.809 --> 17:08.252
Help!

17:08.281 --> 17:09.792
He's seen too much!

No, no, no, no, no, no!
All right,

17:12.519 --> 17:14.113
this redo is officially out
of control.

17:14.143 --> 17:17.160
Just now? That's when it's out
of control?

17:17.190 --> 17:18.852
Uh, breaking and entering,
kidnapping.

17:18.882 --> 17:20.693
Oh, and now opening
other people's mail!

17:20.723 --> 17:22.133
It's not what I envisioned.

17:22.163 --> 17:23.540
What the hell is this?

17:23.569 --> 17:24.645
You bought Tin Cup?

17:24.675 --> 17:26.286
That's a terrible movie.

17:26.316 --> 17:27.523
You mean "classic"?

17:27.554 --> 17:28.814
I like Tin Cup.

17:28.844 --> 17:29.962
But it's a bad movie, right?

17:29.992 --> 17:30.958
You ever see it?

17:30.988 --> 17:32.331
No, I didn't see it.

17:32.361 --> 17:33.837
Then how do you know it's bad?

17:33.867 --> 17:35.226
I don't know.
It's just bad, right?

17:35.256 --> 17:36.683
People think it's bad.

17:36.713 --> 17:38.793
I think I read a review of it
or something.

17:38.823 --> 17:40.736
See? You didn't bother
to see the Tin Cups

17:40.766 --> 17:42.879
because some critic
gave it a bad review!

17:42.909 --> 17:44.888
Hypocrite!

17:44.918 --> 17:46.758
Who knows? Maybe you
would have loved Tin Cups.

17:46.789 --> 17:48.070
Tin Cup.
Tin Cup.

17:48.100 --> 17:50.581

No, it's Tin Cup.

17:51.883 --> 17:53.026
Yes. Tin Cup.

17:53.056 --> 17:54.701
This is killing me!

17:54.731 --> 17:56.009
Good, 'cause it's all
your fault!

17:56.039 --> 17:57.765
You're right. You know,

17:57.795 --> 18:01.666
you may have taped down my arms,
but you have opened my eyes!

18:01.696 --> 18:03.307
I'll never give
a bad review again!

18:03.337 --> 18:04.914
Yay!

18:04.944 --> 18:06.383
In fact, I'm gonna go back
and change

18:06.413 --> 18:08.012
all my bad reviews
to glowing ones...

18:08.042 --> 18:10.724
and add smiley faces.

18:10.754 --> 18:11.832
I think he might be joking!

18:11.862 --> 18:13.604
Reggie, he is.

18:13.634 --> 18:16.065
Enough talk! Do what you're
gonna do to these guys!

18:16.095 --> 18:17.472
Nobody's doing anything.

18:17.502 --> 18:19.715
He did his job.
And you know what?

18:19.745 --> 18:21.692
I'm gonna go do mine.
Come on.

18:21.722 --> 18:23.902
Let's go back to our
restaurants and cook.

18:23.932 --> 18:26.915

have restaurants.

18:31.064 --> 18:32.943
What are we even doing here?

18:32.973 --> 18:34.551
I should be back
at my restaurant

18:34.581 --> 18:35.991
smell-checking the meats.

18:36.021 --> 18:37.833
From now on, I will
only dump sack him

18:37.863 --> 18:39.374
when I'm in the neighbourhood.

18:39.404 --> 18:41.065

18:41.095 --> 18:42.940

18:42.970 --> 18:45.518

for you to forget about today?

I forgot, um...

You want Tin Cup?

19:03.967 --> 19:05.778
Does it have any
special features?

19:05.808 --> 19:07.353
Yeah, It's got outtakes.

19:07.383 --> 19:09.697

"Mulligans."

I just want one slap, okay?

In the back of the head.

a purple nurple.
