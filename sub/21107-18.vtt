That is way above my pay grade.

06:08.569 --> 06:10.736

But I just missed you too much.

21:34.827 --> 21:39.897
Unfortunately,
I didn't have a chance
to get you a Creepmas gift!

21:39.899 --> 21:40.731
Yes, you did.

21:40.733 --> 21:45.069
DRACULA:
<i>With Creepmas now saved</i>
<i>for my Mavy too,</i>

21:45.071 --> 21:48.105
<i>I knew it was time,</i>
<i>I was right on cue,</i>

21:48.107 --> 21:50.975
<i>to fly like a bat</i>
<i>out into the night,</i>

21:50.977 --> 21:53.711
yelling scary Creepmas to all

21:53.713 --> 21:56.013
<i>and to all a good fright!</i>

21:56.015 --> 22:00.618
(LAUGHING)
Scary Creepmas, Dad.

22:06.591 --> 22:08.959
(MUSIC PLAYING)

22:09.494 --> 22:12.496
(VOCALIZING)
