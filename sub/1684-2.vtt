00:01.086 --> 00:03.546
<i>Previously</i>
<i>on</i> Sleepy Hollow...

00:03.630 --> 00:05.674
The Four Horsemen are coming.
The first is already here.

00:06.883 --> 00:08.176
<i>Captain Irving</i>
<i>just signed a confession</i>

00:08.259 --> 00:10.095
<i>to the murders to</i>
<i>protect his daughter.</i>

00:10.929 --> 00:12.514
Jennifer Mills?
I'm her sister.

00:12.597 --> 00:13.598
<i>She's a criminal.</i>

00:13.682 --> 00:15.308
I'm a mental patient
with a gun.

00:15.392 --> 00:16.810
My name is Henry Parish.

00:17.519 --> 00:19.270
You are
the Second Horseman.

00:19.354 --> 00:21.189
The Horseman of War
is my son.

00:21.272 --> 00:22.607
Magnificent.

00:22.691 --> 00:25.443
And my wife is now a captive
of the Horseman of Death.

00:25.527 --> 00:27.195
She's finally yours, Abraham.

00:27.946 --> 00:28.947
Katrina!

00:29.030 --> 00:31.950
Abraham, my heart shall
never belong to you.

00:52.762 --> 00:54.097
Where are we?

00:56.683 --> 00:58.017
What is this place?

01:00.729 --> 01:02.188
Why have you
brought me here?

01:02.272 --> 01:03.773
To complete the ceremony.

01:05.316 --> 01:06.651
Henry.

01:06.735 --> 01:07.944
What ceremony?

01:08.027 --> 01:10.780
Abraham has waited
a long time
to be with you.

01:14.367 --> 01:15.618
For you to truly be his,

01:15.702 --> 01:18.496
we need to
sanctify your bond.

01:32.010 --> 01:34.053
You must be like him

01:34.137 --> 01:35.513
in every way.

01:40.685 --> 01:41.686
Crane?

01:41.770 --> 01:43.438
You were having a nightmare.

01:47.108 --> 01:48.109
Katrina?

01:49.402 --> 01:51.738
We're gonna find her,
but you can't keep this up.

01:51.821 --> 01:53.364
How can I rest,
knowing my wife

01:53.448 --> 01:54.908
is in the clutches
of the Horseman?

01:55.533 --> 01:57.911
He didn't go through
all this trouble
just to kill her.

01:57.994 --> 01:59.412
That's precisely
what concerns me most.

01:59.496 --> 02:01.039
Before I fell asleep,
I believe I discovered

02:01.122 --> 02:02.582
what the Horseman
intends for Katrina.

02:02.665 --> 02:04.709
According to
the Codex Tchacos...

02:04.793 --> 02:06.044
Codex Tchacos.

02:06.127 --> 02:08.254
It's one of the lost
Gospels of the Bible.
You read it?

02:08.338 --> 02:10.089
I found a reference
to a chapter

02:10.173 --> 02:11.883
in one of
Sheriff Corbin's files.

02:13.593 --> 02:16.679
It describes a ceremony
in which a harbinger
of the apocalypse

02:16.763 --> 02:21.100
takes a human bride through
a gruesome, binding ritual.

02:22.852 --> 02:24.938
This is undoubtedly
what Abraham has
in mind for Katrina.

02:25.021 --> 02:27.398
Not exactly up to
Martha Stewart standards.

02:28.358 --> 02:29.359
Martha who?

02:30.068 --> 02:32.153
She's big in
the wedding industry.

02:32.237 --> 02:34.656
Wedding industry.

02:35.865 --> 02:37.992
So, the blessed rites
between a man and a woman...

02:38.076 --> 02:39.577
Has become
a billion-dollar business,

02:39.661 --> 02:41.955
and some great
guilty-pleasure TV.

02:42.622 --> 02:43.623
TV...
Crane.

02:43.706 --> 02:44.999
We're gonna find her first.

02:45.333 --> 02:47.335
Yesterday,
we nailed down
the search radius,

02:47.418 --> 02:49.379
based on the Horseman's
top speed on horseback.

02:49.838 --> 02:52.882
By here, sunrise
would have forced him
to find shelter.

02:52.966 --> 02:55.134
These are
the structures in play.

02:55.885 --> 02:58.304
And Abraham's family owned
a lot of real estate
around Sleepy Hollow.

02:58.388 --> 02:59.639
Daunting inventory.

03:00.265 --> 03:01.724
Less daunting,
if you remember that

03:01.808 --> 03:03.184
he's not just
the Horseman of Death.

03:03.268 --> 03:06.187
He's also a jilted lover
and a former
comrade of yours,

03:06.271 --> 03:08.147
named Abraham Van Brunt.

03:08.231 --> 03:10.275
Oh, thank you
for the reminder.

03:10.859 --> 03:13.486
The point is, you know him.

03:14.320 --> 03:16.114
You know how he'd behave.

03:16.197 --> 03:17.991
For example, you mentioned
that he was a man of means.

03:18.074 --> 03:19.075
Indeed.

03:19.158 --> 03:21.578
He once referred
to the palace
at Versailles as "quaint."

03:21.661 --> 03:24.414
So, maybe he's holding
Katrina someplace that feels

03:24.497 --> 03:27.458
worthy of him,
and a woman that
he still loves.

03:29.752 --> 03:31.337
Yeah, I know I'm late.

03:32.255 --> 03:33.381
For?

03:33.464 --> 03:36.009
New sheriff. They've
appointed a replacement
for Captain Irving.

03:37.010 --> 03:38.803
She is greeting the troops.

03:40.096 --> 03:41.973
See which of these
you think
appeals to Abraham.

03:42.056 --> 03:43.516
And you do what you must.

03:43.600 --> 03:46.019
We must begin
our relationship
with the new sheriff

03:46.102 --> 03:47.270
on a strong foothold.

03:49.147 --> 03:50.481
Tell me
what you find.

03:54.027 --> 03:55.403
Hey. Where's Reyes?
Hey.

03:55.486 --> 03:57.572
Just missed roll call.
Better watch out.

04:03.828 --> 04:05.413
Excuse me.

04:07.582 --> 04:09.584
Sheriff Reyes,
I am sorry I was late.

04:09.667 --> 04:11.044
You won't be late again.

04:11.127 --> 04:12.795
Tell you what,
let's start over.

04:12.879 --> 04:15.298
Clean slate, that's
something you could use,
right, Lieutenant?

04:15.423 --> 04:17.675
Excuse me?
Abigail Mills?
I checked your file.

04:17.759 --> 04:19.344
You were a rising star
in the department.

04:19.427 --> 04:20.637
You even got
admitted to Quantico.

04:20.720 --> 04:21.930
That's impressive at your age.

04:22.013 --> 04:24.891
Then Sheriff Corbin died,
and things changed,
didn't they?

04:24.974 --> 04:26.059
Yes, ma'am.

04:26.142 --> 04:28.019
You were also close
with Captain Irving.

04:28.102 --> 04:30.730
He was, is, a good man.

04:31.898 --> 04:34.067
"Good people, bad luck?"

04:34.150 --> 04:35.944
I heard your mother
say that once.

04:37.028 --> 04:38.112
You knew my mother?

04:38.196 --> 04:40.615
You wouldn't remember,
but I responded to
a few of the calls

04:40.698 --> 04:42.158
when you were pretty small.

04:43.534 --> 04:46.871
It's tough losing
people you love,

04:46.955 --> 04:48.289
people you look up to.

04:48.373 --> 04:49.874
She had a rough time of it.

04:52.043 --> 04:53.044
Yes, ma'am.

04:53.127 --> 04:54.587
You okay?
I didn't mean
to throw you.

04:54.671 --> 04:56.381
No, it's not that.
I just hadn't
put it together.

04:56.464 --> 04:58.174
I knew that you were
at the Sheriff's Department

04:58.257 --> 05:00.843
before you went to
the Border Patrol, but...

05:00.927 --> 05:04.180
Do you know why
drug cartels leave
body parts in public?

05:04.305 --> 05:06.057
That's how
they spread fear.

05:06.140 --> 05:07.976
Exactly, and that's
what's happening here.

05:08.059 --> 05:09.477
But I've worked
the cartels.

05:09.560 --> 05:12.230
I've seen what
real chaos looks like,
and I know how to beat it.

05:12.397 --> 05:14.691
That's why I jumped
when I heard this
position opened up.

05:14.774 --> 05:17.777
I'm not gonna let fear
and hysteria take root,
not in my hometown.

05:17.902 --> 05:19.988
You can definitely
count on me, Sheriff.
Good.

05:20.071 --> 05:21.155
Then, I will.

05:21.239 --> 05:24.158
We are gonna
bring some sanity
back to this town.

05:29.580 --> 05:31.541
I have an idea where
Abraham's keeping my wife.

05:31.624 --> 05:32.792
Go ahead.

05:33.710 --> 05:37.964
The man I knew
was not one normally
prone to sentimentality.

05:38.047 --> 05:39.590
His engagement to
Katrina was born

05:39.674 --> 05:41.134
less of romance
than of business.

05:41.926 --> 05:43.928
Weren't you just
telling me marriage
was a "blessed rite"?

05:44.721 --> 05:46.264
For some more than others.

05:47.306 --> 05:51.477
Katrina's father knew
a union with Abraham
would improve his finances.

05:51.561 --> 05:53.980
Such was his interest
in marrying her off.

05:59.736 --> 06:02.780
There we go.

06:03.364 --> 06:07.577
<i>But in truth,</i>
<i>Abraham did care</i>
<i>for Katrina, in his way.</i>

06:09.287 --> 06:11.706
Something I saw when
she accepted his proposal

06:11.789 --> 06:13.499
at their estate
in Willow Point.

06:14.542 --> 06:16.377
Willow Point.
Never heard of it.

06:16.878 --> 06:19.797
You would know it
as Dobbs Ferry.

06:20.631 --> 06:22.216
We have a few hours
left of sunlight.

06:22.300 --> 06:24.469
Let's check it out before
the Horseman can ride.

06:26.804 --> 06:29.640
Lieutenant, this morning

06:29.724 --> 06:32.977
something seemed
weighing on your mind.

06:34.353 --> 06:36.564
I know we got
a lot going on,

06:36.647 --> 06:38.941
but I just want
to make sure
that we stay focused

06:39.025 --> 06:40.526
on Moloch's larger plan.

06:42.320 --> 06:43.446
We are.

06:45.656 --> 06:47.366
If rescuing Katrina...

06:49.660 --> 06:51.954
She's more than just my wife.

06:52.455 --> 06:55.208
She is a witch of
extraordinary abilities.

06:55.291 --> 06:57.543
She could tip the scales
of this war on either side.

06:57.627 --> 07:00.963
But Henry, the Horseman of War
is here somewhere.

07:01.047 --> 07:03.382
All the more reason
for us to strike now.

07:03.466 --> 07:04.509
Ahead of them.

07:08.930 --> 07:10.598
Lieutenant.

07:11.474 --> 07:15.436
You must trust me when
I say I have not forgotten
our duty as Witnesses.

07:16.604 --> 07:20.691
But I do have
another duty, to my wife.

07:22.068 --> 07:24.237
I intend to honor them both.

07:42.713 --> 07:43.714
There.

07:44.841 --> 07:46.634
Preparation for the ceremony.

07:48.219 --> 07:49.846
Need to confirm
that she's inside.

07:50.346 --> 07:51.556
Agreed.

07:53.182 --> 07:54.433
Crane.

07:54.517 --> 07:55.893
Crane, wait.

08:05.236 --> 08:07.446
Confirmation
of the Horseman.

08:23.671 --> 08:24.839
Crane, let's go.

08:27.341 --> 08:28.342
Katrina.

08:29.635 --> 08:30.678
She's inside.

08:30.761 --> 08:31.721
Crane.

08:31.804 --> 08:33.347
We go after her now,
it's suicide.

08:34.056 --> 08:36.392
The altar isn't finished.
We come back
after we have a plan.

08:36.475 --> 08:38.477
Let's go. Come on.

08:40.605 --> 08:41.939
So, we have to
find a way to lure

08:42.023 --> 08:43.566
the Horseman away
from the house?

08:43.649 --> 08:46.235
Or distract him
long enough to break in
and pull Katrina out.

08:46.319 --> 08:47.361
What is that?

08:47.778 --> 08:49.030
It's the Codex Tchacos.

08:49.113 --> 08:50.740
- It's one of the lost...
- Lost Gospels.

08:50.823 --> 08:52.742
I know. An "apocryphal."
I retrieved it for Corbin.

08:52.825 --> 08:54.744
I mean, what's that?

08:54.827 --> 08:56.996
Thank you.
It's Romani-Greek.

08:57.079 --> 08:59.665
And that is "the Kindred."

09:00.416 --> 09:03.711
A creature assembled from
parts of deceased soldiers.

09:03.794 --> 09:06.881
A patchwork creation

09:06.964 --> 09:09.926
believed to be a match
for the Horseman of Death.

09:10.009 --> 09:11.344
I've seen that
drawing before.

09:11.427 --> 09:12.970
In the
Benjamin Franklin
sketchbook?

09:13.429 --> 09:14.805
It's the Kindred.

09:14.889 --> 09:16.182
Well, it stands to reason.

09:16.265 --> 09:18.351
No one was more obsessed
with death than Franklin.

09:18.434 --> 09:19.602
But this text

09:19.685 --> 09:23.564
details Franklin's greatest
experiment with death.

09:24.482 --> 09:26.317
<i>"We continue</i>
<i>to suffer heavy losses</i>

09:26.400 --> 09:28.236
<i>"at the hand of</i>
<i>the Horseman of Death.</i>

09:33.574 --> 09:37.245
<i>"To counter his assault,</i>
<i>General Washington</i>
<i>again has allied</i>

09:37.328 --> 09:39.997
<i>"with the Sisterhood</i>
<i>of the Radiant Heart.</i>

09:40.081 --> 09:44.418
<i>"The coven knew of a spell</i>
<i>to create the Kindred.</i>

09:44.502 --> 09:48.172
<i>"To create a body</i>
<i>powerful enough</i>
<i>to contain Death's spirit,</i>

09:48.256 --> 09:50.841
<i>"they turned to yours truly.</i>

09:57.765 --> 10:00.935
<i>"I'm harvesting the limbs</i>
<i>of fallen soldiers.</i>

10:01.769 --> 10:04.355
<i>"Combining only</i>
<i>the strongest pieces.</i>

10:10.319 --> 10:13.030
<i>"Out of these</i>
<i>succumbed souls,</i>

10:13.114 --> 10:15.324
<i>"we molded</i>
<i>the massive frame for..."</i>

10:15.408 --> 10:16.450
"Our Kindred."

10:17.285 --> 10:20.538
In the end,
Franklin and the coven
never raised the creature

10:20.621 --> 10:25.584
because they were unable to
acquire a vital ingredient

10:25.668 --> 10:27.211
to complete the spell.

10:28.796 --> 10:30.840
A body part from
the Horseman of Death.

10:30.923 --> 10:33.175
Well, unlike
your founding friends,

10:33.259 --> 10:35.970
we have a pretty big piece
of him at our disposal.

10:37.972 --> 10:39.515
His head.

10:39.598 --> 10:42.643
Lieutenant, we have
in our possession
the means and method

10:42.727 --> 10:44.812
to create a weapon
of unearthly power.

10:44.895 --> 10:46.772
This spell
resurrects a creature

10:46.856 --> 10:48.607
that can rival
the Horseman of Death.

10:48.691 --> 10:50.818
So, we're not talking
about raising a weapon.

10:50.901 --> 10:53.237
We're talking about
raising a monster.

11:44.747 --> 11:45.998
Father,

11:47.333 --> 11:49.251
I am blessed to be
in your presence.

11:49.668 --> 11:51.629
I'm sorry.

11:52.171 --> 11:53.714
I know I failed you.

11:53.798 --> 11:57.093
Failed to open a portal,
to herald your arrival.

12:00.971 --> 12:02.098
Your anger is righteous.

12:02.181 --> 12:04.016
But the cause
is not lost.

12:04.100 --> 12:08.437
I will not rest until
I find a way for you
to rise on earth.

12:08.813 --> 12:10.189
Soon,

12:10.272 --> 12:13.401
you will scorch the earth
with hellfire and damnation,
I swear it!

12:25.746 --> 12:26.831
This is insane!

12:26.914 --> 12:29.417
Too much of my life
can be characterized
under those auspices.

12:29.500 --> 12:31.919
You and I are
considering making

12:32.002 --> 12:33.921
a carbon copy of
the Headless Horseman.

12:34.004 --> 12:35.214
Except, with a head.

12:35.297 --> 12:37.258
This Kindred wouldn't
just be a monster,

12:37.341 --> 12:38.342
it would be our monster.

12:38.426 --> 12:39.760
One that fights for us.

12:39.844 --> 12:41.262
An equal to the Horseman.

12:41.345 --> 12:42.596
You don't know that for sure.

12:42.680 --> 12:43.931
Or if we can control it.

12:44.014 --> 12:45.307
We could be
delivering the head

12:45.391 --> 12:46.600
directly back to
the pale rider.

12:46.684 --> 12:47.852
He could become whole.

12:47.935 --> 12:49.937
Great, 'cause that's
exactly what he needs
is more firepower.

12:50.020 --> 12:51.605
Granted, there will be risks.

12:51.689 --> 12:54.066
But this Kindred
is our best option.

13:00.197 --> 13:01.198
Okay.

13:02.032 --> 13:03.033
Kindred, it is.

13:03.117 --> 13:05.703
I'll find out where Irving
locked away the skull.

13:05.786 --> 13:08.789
And I'll continue to decode
the remaining instructions.

13:08.873 --> 13:11.083
Apparently,

13:11.167 --> 13:14.086
Franklin prepared
and preserved a body.

13:14.170 --> 13:15.296
Oh, joy.

13:16.046 --> 13:18.424
Can you go to the tunnels
and find our cache of weapons?

13:18.549 --> 13:20.259
Kindred or not,
I'd feel better

13:20.342 --> 13:22.803
if we had our own
fully-loaded distraction.

13:22.970 --> 13:24.430
You know where
the cache is, right?

13:24.513 --> 13:27.266
Yeah, it's just...

13:28.642 --> 13:30.895
The last time we went on
a mission to save Katrina,

13:30.978 --> 13:32.104
it didn't end well.

13:32.229 --> 13:35.149
True, but, this time,
our eyes are open.

13:56.837 --> 13:58.631
I know how you
treasure this necklace.

13:59.298 --> 14:01.091
Now, you need
never take it off.

14:01.175 --> 14:02.801
Spare me your illusions.

14:02.885 --> 14:05.304
I prefer to see you
as the monster you are.

14:05.387 --> 14:07.765
There are no illusions here.
What you see is the truth.

14:07.848 --> 14:09.350
Yet, all you do is lie.

14:09.433 --> 14:11.644
You told me that
the man I love was dead.

14:13.562 --> 14:16.398
The man you love
never existed.

14:16.482 --> 14:19.235
The Ichabod Crane you know
is a deception.

14:19.318 --> 14:21.612
You are the deception.

14:23.197 --> 14:26.158
Ichabod is alive and free.

14:26.242 --> 14:28.410
And what did he chose
to do with his freedom?

14:28.494 --> 14:31.664
Did he search
the ends of the earth
to find his beloved wife?

14:31.747 --> 14:34.416
No, he rescued
another woman.

14:34.500 --> 14:35.626
Abigail Mills.

14:35.709 --> 14:38.295
Couldn't stand
to see her trapped
in purgatory mere hours.

14:38.379 --> 14:40.714
And yet, how long did he
leave you to rot there?

14:40.798 --> 14:43.425
Ichabod once claimed
to care about me, too,

14:43.509 --> 14:45.177
but he moved on.

14:45.261 --> 14:47.346
And now he has
moved on again.

14:47.429 --> 14:48.639
You've seen it, Katrina.

14:49.431 --> 14:51.058
Remember our bond.

14:51.225 --> 14:52.560
I'll come back for you.

14:55.187 --> 14:56.230
I know

14:57.982 --> 14:59.900
this is hard
for you to grasp.

14:59.984 --> 15:01.527
You have barely glimpsed
the larger story.

15:02.611 --> 15:04.071
Moloch has a plan
for us all.

15:04.154 --> 15:06.323
And what is
the plan for me?

15:07.825 --> 15:08.993
For us.

15:12.079 --> 15:14.206
I will never go willingly.

15:14.290 --> 15:16.000
You don't have to.

15:16.917 --> 15:19.044
But I truly hope you do.

15:32.182 --> 15:33.559
Oh, my God.
What happened?

15:33.642 --> 15:36.562
Apparently, inmates
don't like former cops.

15:37.354 --> 15:38.397
Who knew?

15:38.897 --> 15:41.108
I'm gonna talk to the sheriff
and have you transferred.

15:41.191 --> 15:43.027
Cynthia's getting
me a new lawyer.

15:45.195 --> 15:47.281
Sheriff's coming
down here later today.

15:47.364 --> 15:49.491
Is that why you're here?

15:49.575 --> 15:51.493
Actually,
it's kind of urgent.

15:51.577 --> 15:52.786
What's going on?

15:55.331 --> 15:56.624
We need the head.

15:58.375 --> 15:59.418
He's back?

15:59.501 --> 16:00.961
And he's taken
Crane's wife.

16:01.128 --> 16:03.380
The witch?
How did she get
out of purgatory?

16:03.464 --> 16:04.673
That's part of the problem.

16:04.757 --> 16:06.925
And why things may
go from bad to worse.

16:07.134 --> 16:08.469
But the head?

16:08.552 --> 16:09.970
We're gonna use
it against him.

16:10.054 --> 16:12.222
Trust me, we have a plan.

16:15.225 --> 16:17.853
Sleepy Hollow
Savings and Loan.

16:19.647 --> 16:21.899
You put the
Headless Horseman's head
in the bank?

16:21.982 --> 16:24.777
I put the Horseman's head
in a safety deposit box

16:24.860 --> 16:28.489
in a steel vault behind
six-inch bulletproof walls

16:28.572 --> 16:30.449
and 24-hour armed security.

16:32.660 --> 16:35.329
Now, tell me what's
really going on out there.

16:35.412 --> 16:36.914
Let us handle
the craziness out there,

16:36.997 --> 16:38.749
you've got enough
to deal with in here.

16:41.919 --> 16:43.671
You did a brave thing,
Captain,

16:43.754 --> 16:47.007
confessing to those crimes
to save your daughter.

16:47.091 --> 16:49.635
I thought about
telling the truth.

16:50.427 --> 16:51.428
Let them think I'm crazy.

16:51.512 --> 16:53.514
Get sent to
Tarrytown Psychiatric.

16:53.597 --> 16:55.516
Yeah, why not use
the insanity plea?

16:55.599 --> 16:57.142
My lawyer didn't
think it would hold.

16:58.102 --> 16:59.186
Now it's too late.

16:59.269 --> 17:00.354
You have to try.

17:00.437 --> 17:02.773
As someone with
experience at Tarrytown,

17:02.856 --> 17:05.150
visitation is a lot
easier for us than prison.

17:06.610 --> 17:08.195
We want you close.

17:12.449 --> 17:13.992
Thomas Jefferson once said,

17:14.076 --> 17:17.329
"Banking establishments
are more dangerous
than standing armies."

17:17.454 --> 17:19.039
Just stand in line
and go with the flow.

17:19.123 --> 17:21.542
Two statements
which mean the opposite.

17:21.625 --> 17:24.294
You founded a country.
Figure it out.

17:37.474 --> 17:39.393
Good afternoon, sir.

17:39.476 --> 17:41.103
Welcome to
Sleepy Hollow
Savings and Loan.

17:41.186 --> 17:43.230
These people entrust you
with their fortune,

17:43.355 --> 17:45.649
yet you cannot entrust them
with a simple inkwell?

17:45.733 --> 17:48.819
Well, could I interest
you in our new
Ulterra credit card?

17:49.570 --> 17:51.739
Credit without collateral?

17:51.822 --> 17:53.699
So you can get that
special someone in your life

17:53.782 --> 17:55.451
everything
her heart desires.

17:55.534 --> 17:56.952
Perhaps an engagement ring?

17:58.245 --> 18:00.080
Are you part of
the wedding industry?

18:00.164 --> 18:01.206
No, sir.

18:01.290 --> 18:03.459
I'm just here to offer you
our lowest rates of the year.

18:03.542 --> 18:06.545
You can get a $5,000
credit line. No fees.

18:06.628 --> 18:09.089
It is this kind of gross
invitation to indulgence

18:09.173 --> 18:11.633
that mocks the power
of the invisible hand

18:11.717 --> 18:13.761
to foster the true
wealth of nations.

18:13.844 --> 18:15.429
A boon to your industry,
I'll grant,

18:15.512 --> 18:18.599
yet cementing your,
it pains me now to say it,

18:18.682 --> 18:21.602
"our" lot as
an insolvent
flock of debtors,

18:21.685 --> 18:23.020
destined...
Come on.

18:26.857 --> 18:28.817
Thank you.
Have a good day.

18:44.875 --> 18:46.460
We're really
gonna do this, huh?

18:46.543 --> 18:49.087
Bring that thing
back out into the world.

18:49.171 --> 18:50.297
This has brought nothing

18:50.380 --> 18:52.382
but pain and misery
into our lives.

18:56.637 --> 19:00.265
For once, let it serve
as a force for good,

19:00.349 --> 19:02.017
and save Katrina.

19:18.534 --> 19:19.493
Can I help you?

19:19.576 --> 19:22.246
I could ask the same question,
this being police archives.

19:22.329 --> 19:23.330
You police?

19:23.747 --> 19:26.124
I'm just waiting for
my sister, Abbie Mills.

19:28.085 --> 19:29.253
You're Jenny.

19:30.045 --> 19:31.463
Do I know you?

19:31.547 --> 19:32.923
I'm familiar with your file.

19:33.006 --> 19:36.301
You recently escaped from
Tarrytown Psychiatric.

19:36.385 --> 19:38.512
I have other achievements.

19:38.595 --> 19:41.807
Like flipping your SUV
on Highway 484 last week

19:41.890 --> 19:43.183
and fleeing the scene?

19:45.185 --> 19:46.395
What you got there?

19:48.355 --> 19:49.731
Nothing exciting.

19:51.108 --> 19:52.234
Great.

19:52.317 --> 19:54.695
Nothing makes me
happier than finding

19:54.778 --> 19:56.405
"nothing exciting."

20:00.284 --> 20:02.035
Jennifer Mills,
you are under arrest

20:02.119 --> 20:03.871
for illegal possession
of firearms

20:03.954 --> 20:05.330
and violation of probation.

20:09.209 --> 20:11.086
Why was the sheriff
in the archives?

20:11.169 --> 20:13.046
Get a new job,
you walk the hallways.

20:13.130 --> 20:15.883
Well, we need those weapons,
and we need your sister
to aid in our plan.

20:15.966 --> 20:18.802
Let's find out
exactly what happened
and ask the sheriff.

20:18.886 --> 20:20.345
And I say, why wait?

20:21.054 --> 20:23.307
Sheriff Reyes, I think there's
been some kind of confusion.

20:23.390 --> 20:24.474
You could say that.

20:24.558 --> 20:26.435
I've got two
decapitated bodies
in the morgue,

20:26.518 --> 20:28.270
and I find an ex-con
in my back office,

20:28.353 --> 20:30.898
packing enough firepower
to take on a battalion.

20:30.981 --> 20:32.816
My sister was
in the archives
because of me.

20:32.900 --> 20:34.192
It's okay, Abbie.
No, it's not.

20:34.276 --> 20:37.988
Abbie! She found the guns
in my possession, okay?

20:38.071 --> 20:39.323
I got caught.

20:40.407 --> 20:41.700
I am sorry, Miss Jenny.

20:42.159 --> 20:44.244
You must be
the history consultant.

20:44.328 --> 20:45.829
Oxford's finest.

20:46.663 --> 20:48.582
My name is Ichabod Crane.

20:48.665 --> 20:50.000
I understand
we're short-staffed,

20:50.083 --> 20:52.669
but I don't see
a need for
a history consultant.

20:52.753 --> 20:55.797
Captain Irving
found me quite helpful.

20:55.881 --> 20:57.215
He is also in prison,

20:57.299 --> 20:59.718
so you'll find he and I
operate very differently.

20:59.801 --> 21:01.386
As a history professor,

21:01.470 --> 21:04.306
I'm sure you'll appreciate
if I do my homework

21:04.389 --> 21:07.017
before opening up any
more case files to you.

21:08.644 --> 21:09.603
Mills.

21:09.686 --> 21:11.063
Ma'am.

21:15.359 --> 21:18.028
Before, when I said "sanity,"
that was a poor word choice.

21:18.111 --> 21:19.655
I wasn't intending
that towards you.

21:19.738 --> 21:21.114
Thank you, ma'am.

21:25.285 --> 21:29.331
To whom was the sheriff
referring when
she mentioned sanity?

21:29.414 --> 21:32.626
She knew my mother,
who was a little bit,
totally crazy.

21:34.211 --> 21:35.629
We'll deal with her later.

21:35.712 --> 21:39.174
For now, stick to the tunnels
to get in and out
of the archives.

21:47.557 --> 21:48.767
Is your name Frank Irving?

21:48.850 --> 21:49.851
Yes.

21:51.019 --> 21:52.104
You're currently
in Sleepy Hollow?

21:53.438 --> 21:54.564
Yes.

21:55.941 --> 21:58.318
Did you confess
to the murders of
Jason Boland and Devon Jones?

21:58.402 --> 21:59.403
Yes.

21:59.486 --> 22:00.821
Did you kill Jason Boland
and Devon Jones?

22:00.904 --> 22:02.072
No.

22:05.867 --> 22:07.119
Do you know
who did kill them?

22:07.202 --> 22:08.453
Yes.

22:08.537 --> 22:10.747
A demon named Ancitef.

22:14.501 --> 22:16.128
A demon?
Yes.

22:16.211 --> 22:18.255
And his name is Anticef?

22:19.006 --> 22:20.757
Ancitef.

22:20.924 --> 22:23.427
"C" comes before "T."

22:23.760 --> 22:26.805
It possessed people,
made them do things
against their will.

22:27.389 --> 22:29.725
So you were lying
when you confessed
to the murders?

22:29.808 --> 22:30.851
No.

22:31.143 --> 22:33.311
I felt responsible.

22:33.395 --> 22:34.813
Ancitef was after me.

22:35.355 --> 22:38.442
If you don't
believe me, look him up.

22:38.525 --> 22:40.694
I'm sure you're aware
that your responses

22:40.777 --> 22:43.196
obligate me to have you
psychiatrically evaluated,

22:43.280 --> 22:44.990
which means a transfer
to a psych ward.

22:45.073 --> 22:47.159
That's a step up
from supermax, isn't it?

22:47.242 --> 22:48.702
You think I'm lying?
Check the machine.

22:48.785 --> 22:50.495
We both know there are
ways to cheat that thing.

22:54.374 --> 22:56.877
I have friends in
Tarrytown Psych.

22:56.960 --> 22:58.795
And they tell me there
are wonderful new ways

22:58.879 --> 23:00.297
to treat
hallucinations these days.

23:01.631 --> 23:03.216
Antipsychotic drugs.

23:03.300 --> 23:05.635
Electroshock therapy.

23:06.303 --> 23:08.138
I'll make sure
you get the latest.

23:13.977 --> 23:16.396
Franklin
worked with the Masons

23:16.480 --> 23:18.815
to build these tunnels
beneath the town.

23:19.316 --> 23:22.319
They were used for
transporting supplies

23:22.402 --> 23:24.529
and hiding colonial secrets.

23:24.988 --> 23:26.573
Those secrets
apparently included

23:26.656 --> 23:28.617
a precursor to
Frankenstein's monster.

23:30.160 --> 23:32.579
Remind me to make you
another reading list.

23:32.662 --> 23:33.705
Right.

23:34.122 --> 23:35.916
We've never been in
this section before.

23:35.999 --> 23:37.793
You sure you know
where we're going?

23:37.876 --> 23:39.795
Unquestionably.

23:41.963 --> 23:44.132
It's nice to know
that even a man
from the 18th century

23:44.216 --> 23:45.675
won't ask for help
with directions.

23:46.009 --> 23:47.969
I'm beginning to
suspect Franklin had

23:48.053 --> 23:50.305
lost his rudder when
he wrote these notes.

24:30.470 --> 24:32.222
All right.

24:32.305 --> 24:33.890
Well, uh...

24:34.349 --> 24:35.809
This way.

24:44.776 --> 24:48.363
And the Kindred should be

24:48.446 --> 24:50.031
here.

24:55.287 --> 24:57.581
Maybe we did
take a wrong turn.

25:00.750 --> 25:01.793
Lieutenant?

25:02.586 --> 25:03.545
Yeah.

25:03.628 --> 25:04.671
Are you all right?

25:04.754 --> 25:05.797
I'm fine.

25:05.881 --> 25:08.216
Just reminded me
of something in purgatory.

25:14.514 --> 25:18.810
You never did tell
me the full extent of
your ordeal in that place.

25:23.231 --> 25:25.233
The truth is,
it got to me.

25:26.109 --> 25:30.989
Everywhere I went,
I felt it slowly clawing
at my mind, my soul.

25:33.575 --> 25:35.118
You know what
the worst part was?

25:36.536 --> 25:37.913
Seeing you.

25:39.247 --> 25:40.999
Must be why
you beheaded me.

25:41.082 --> 25:42.751
That demon version
of you appeared

25:42.834 --> 25:46.046
just when that place
was about to break me.

25:46.504 --> 25:49.007
I'd never been so happy
to see anyone in my life.

25:50.258 --> 25:52.093
He offered me water,
and I was going to drink it,

25:52.177 --> 25:53.428
even though I
knew I shouldn't.

25:53.511 --> 25:56.723
I was just seconds away
from being lost forever...

25:56.806 --> 25:57.891
You weren't to blame.

25:57.974 --> 26:00.685
Purgatory finds
your weakness,

26:00.769 --> 26:02.187
plucks at it.

26:02.812 --> 26:04.189
That's what scares me.

26:04.272 --> 26:06.900
My faith in you is
my greatest weakness.

26:08.276 --> 26:09.986
That's what they
want you to believe.

26:13.448 --> 26:14.658
Lieutenant,

26:15.867 --> 26:18.161
do you think Katrina

26:18.245 --> 26:19.913
is my weakness?

26:20.914 --> 26:21.998
Maybe.

26:22.832 --> 26:24.501
Or maybe it's Henry.

26:24.584 --> 26:26.336
I think part
of why you chose

26:26.419 --> 26:28.588
to take on Abraham
rather than go after Henry

26:28.672 --> 26:31.132
is because, despite
everything he's done to us,

26:31.216 --> 26:32.509
Henry is still your son.

26:38.306 --> 26:39.349
Crane.

26:41.810 --> 26:43.270
Look at these
metal plates.

26:45.689 --> 26:46.690
Huh.

26:47.107 --> 26:48.817
No, Lieutenant! Whoa!

26:51.653 --> 26:55.031
That is the family
crest of Luigi Galvani,

26:55.115 --> 26:59.244
an Italian physicist
who Franklin admired
almost as much as himself,

26:59.327 --> 27:01.788
because Galvani

27:02.289 --> 27:06.126
was the inventor of
the galvanic cell.

27:06.209 --> 27:08.378
Otherwise known as...

27:12.048 --> 27:13.049
Whoa.

27:15.635 --> 27:17.345
A battery.

27:23.101 --> 27:24.519
"Kindred."

28:11.358 --> 28:12.484
Ah!

28:17.697 --> 28:19.657
Meet
our new best friend.

28:20.575 --> 28:22.911
Franklin-stein's monster.

28:23.536 --> 28:24.913
Charmed.

28:25.121 --> 28:27.082
We've disappointed him.

28:27.165 --> 28:29.125
But he will still rise.

28:29.209 --> 28:30.835
The plan is in motion.

28:31.252 --> 28:32.837
Father is coming.

28:33.630 --> 28:35.215
But we can't fail him again.

28:41.888 --> 28:43.348
Hello, Mother.

28:43.807 --> 28:44.849
Jeremy.

28:44.933 --> 28:46.559
I told you,
I am not Jeremy.

28:46.643 --> 28:51.481
The boy you knew
as your son died
in a pine box 200 years ago.

28:52.482 --> 28:55.568
How blind you people are
to the reality before you.

28:55.652 --> 28:58.530
That blindness is going to
get your husband killed.

28:59.239 --> 29:01.157
Why? What are you doing?

29:01.241 --> 29:03.451
Me? Nothing.

29:04.160 --> 29:05.954
But he's as deluded
as you are.

29:07.038 --> 29:09.416
He's discovered
our carriage house.

29:09.499 --> 29:11.501
They're coming to save you.

29:12.836 --> 29:14.462
The question is.

29:14.671 --> 29:16.339
Who will save them?

29:19.175 --> 29:20.593
We clear on the plan?

29:20.677 --> 29:22.053
We raise the Kindred,
and once it's dark,

29:22.137 --> 29:24.431
we lure the Horseman outside.
While they battle...

29:24.514 --> 29:26.307
I go in
and retrieve Katrina.

29:26.391 --> 29:28.309
So do we need to light
candles or something?

29:28.810 --> 29:30.270
Only if you
wish to set a mood.

29:32.856 --> 29:34.607
According to
Franklin's notes,

29:34.691 --> 29:36.067
the coven
enchanted this body,

29:36.151 --> 29:39.737
so reciting the incantation
is the sole requirement.

29:40.155 --> 29:43.533
Plus, one head
of the Horseman of Death.

29:48.121 --> 29:49.789
Ah!

29:51.416 --> 29:55.253
It's likely a response
to its proximity
to the Horseman.

29:55.336 --> 29:57.422
He may know we're here.

30:07.432 --> 30:08.892
Point of no return, Crane.

30:25.408 --> 30:27.035
This isn't necessary,
Abraham.

30:27.118 --> 30:28.620
I wish that were the case.

30:28.703 --> 30:30.455
I mean, it isn't necessary
to kill Ichabod.

30:30.538 --> 30:32.874
I will kill whom I please.

30:32.957 --> 30:35.043
But it's foretold
in the apocryphals.

30:35.126 --> 30:37.504
The Witnesses aren't meant
to die at the hand
of the Horsemen.

30:37.587 --> 30:40.173
There are larger plans
for them than either
you or I may have.

30:40.256 --> 30:41.341
The apocryphals.

30:41.424 --> 30:43.885
They are dubious texts,
aren't they?

30:43.968 --> 30:45.470
So many have
proven to be false.

30:46.971 --> 30:49.265
Crane's life will end
on the eve your
new life begins.

31:51.202 --> 31:52.203
Is there more?

31:52.287 --> 31:54.038
No.
Did you do it right?

31:54.122 --> 31:56.207
I followed the instructions.

31:58.501 --> 32:00.336
I'm not the witch
in the family.

32:01.546 --> 32:03.548
My pronunciation may
have been a little off.

32:03.631 --> 32:05.550
There are words
I've not spoken before.

32:05.633 --> 32:07.552
I'll do it again.
You might want to do it fast.

32:11.764 --> 32:13.683
I wanted it to
be you, Abraham.

32:14.017 --> 32:15.476
Not Ichabod.

32:15.560 --> 32:16.561
You.

32:19.272 --> 32:21.065
What I needed was time.

32:21.149 --> 32:23.526
I wasn't ready
to marry anyone.

32:23.610 --> 32:25.570
Ichabod gave me all
the time in the world.

32:26.613 --> 32:30.992
He was an escape route
that your haste
turned into a husband.

32:33.036 --> 32:35.872
If this is
to be our future,

32:35.955 --> 32:39.542
do not let your impatience
ruin us a second time.

32:41.461 --> 32:42.879
If you take me now,

32:43.880 --> 32:47.717
you will live an eternity
knowing that I'm
not truly yours.

32:49.302 --> 32:52.388
Let me accept of
my own free will.

33:13.117 --> 33:15.787
Incoming! Crane!

33:17.038 --> 33:18.039
Time's up!

33:40.770 --> 33:41.896
Now's your chance.

33:41.979 --> 33:43.189
Get to the house,
get Katrina.

33:43.272 --> 33:44.357
The munitions.

33:44.440 --> 33:45.566
In the truck.
I've got it. Go!

33:45.650 --> 33:46.859
At the first sign
of trouble...

33:46.943 --> 33:47.944
You'll hear from me.

33:50.905 --> 33:51.906
Katrina!

33:51.989 --> 33:53.199
Ichabod!

33:55.326 --> 33:57.370
Has he hurt you?
Are you injured?

33:57.453 --> 33:59.205
No. No.

33:59.664 --> 34:00.748
We must hurry.

34:00.832 --> 34:02.875
We've drawn him away,
but we know not how long.

34:02.959 --> 34:04.043
Ichabod...

34:04.127 --> 34:05.294
Lieutenant Mills has
arranged conveyance.

34:05.378 --> 34:07.171
We're to rendezvous
at the far end
of the estate.

34:07.672 --> 34:08.965
Quickly, Katrina! Hurry!
Ichabod!

34:09.048 --> 34:11.634
You must leave
here without me.

34:12.719 --> 34:14.387
Do you not know
what he has planned?

34:14.470 --> 34:15.722
I have convinced
him to delay.

34:15.805 --> 34:17.265
He will not perform
the ritual

34:17.348 --> 34:19.642
until I have
submitted to him
by my own free will.

34:20.309 --> 34:22.311
He thinks that in time
I will learn to love him.

34:23.479 --> 34:24.439
Katrina...

34:24.522 --> 34:27.608
If I leave,
Abraham will scorch
the earth to hunt me down.

34:27.692 --> 34:29.569
He will stop at
nothing to find me,

34:29.652 --> 34:31.320
killing you
and countless more
along the way...

34:31.404 --> 34:32.822
You will be at his mercy.

34:32.905 --> 34:34.323
And by his side.

34:34.699 --> 34:37.326
Which I believe can
be to our advantage.

34:37.410 --> 34:39.996
I have heard things,
talk between
Abraham and Henry.

34:40.538 --> 34:41.789
You've seen them together?

34:41.873 --> 34:44.333
They're plotting a new way
for Moloch to rise.

34:45.042 --> 34:46.043
How?

34:46.377 --> 34:47.670
I do not know.

34:48.796 --> 34:51.758
But I do know that
there is a greater
plan in motion.

34:51.841 --> 34:53.676
One that involves
all of us.

34:53.760 --> 34:56.554
And if I stay,
I will learn it.

35:50.900 --> 35:53.402
Great job, Mills.
What's next?

35:54.904 --> 35:55.947
Damn!

36:15.424 --> 36:17.927
There's more than Abraham
to contend with.

36:19.595 --> 36:21.180
There's also Henry.

36:21.264 --> 36:24.851
Our son.
He's still our son.

36:24.934 --> 36:27.854
He's been twisted
into something dark
because he's suffered.

36:27.937 --> 36:30.189
And for that I bear
more than a measure
of responsibility.

36:30.273 --> 36:32.233
But what kind of
a mother would I be

36:32.316 --> 36:35.194
if I didn't at least
attempt to save him?

36:37.446 --> 36:39.282
You know I am right.

36:40.533 --> 36:43.786
All this time you've been
lost to me in purgatory.

36:44.662 --> 36:46.497
Now, I've finally found you.

37:02.054 --> 37:05.308
I cannot tell you
how much this
pains me as well.

37:06.559 --> 37:08.477
But there's
too much at stake.

37:08.561 --> 37:11.314
We have no choice.

37:11.397 --> 37:13.399
Crane! We're out of time!

37:13.482 --> 37:15.276
Ichabod, you have
to trust me!

37:15.359 --> 37:17.069
Now, go!

37:19.822 --> 37:21.449
You are forever in my heart.

37:39.258 --> 37:41.177
We got to get
out of here.

37:41.260 --> 37:42.553
Agreed.

38:17.421 --> 38:19.423
Forgive me,
the ropes were
starting to chafe.

38:20.299 --> 38:21.968
It wasn't hard
to loosen them.

38:22.051 --> 38:24.053
I presume you did
that for my comfort.

38:25.304 --> 38:26.305
You could have fled.

38:26.389 --> 38:27.473
And where would I go?

38:28.557 --> 38:30.476
You've made your
intentions plain.

38:30.559 --> 38:33.562
Wherever I go,
you would follow.

38:34.271 --> 38:36.649
So I have come to
see that for now,

38:37.400 --> 38:39.068
this is my place.

38:39.151 --> 38:40.528
Besides,

38:41.445 --> 38:43.197
this is not my world.

38:46.534 --> 38:49.245
You're wise not to
acclimate to this world.

38:50.496 --> 38:52.915
It will not exist
much longer.

38:59.547 --> 39:01.590
Still no sign
of the Kindred.

39:02.049 --> 39:03.592
I know I was
the one worried

39:03.676 --> 39:05.052
about releasing
another monster

39:05.136 --> 39:07.096
into the world,
but I have to say,

39:07.179 --> 39:08.514
this one seems
to be on our side.

39:08.597 --> 39:11.225
It certainly had no love
for the Horsemen.
Hmm.

39:12.018 --> 39:13.436
I just wish...

39:13.811 --> 39:15.271
We lost the head.

39:15.354 --> 39:18.482
There is still a chance
it simply disappeared

39:18.566 --> 39:20.568
back from whence it came.

39:20.651 --> 39:22.278
The void.

39:22.903 --> 39:24.447
But to your point.

39:24.530 --> 39:28.242
The way we fight monsters
cannot be to create monsters.

39:28.951 --> 39:30.286
We must be
better than them.

39:31.454 --> 39:32.788
Let's take the victory.

39:33.622 --> 39:36.250
Our plan worked.
We got to Katrina.

39:36.333 --> 39:37.710
Yes. We did.

39:37.793 --> 39:38.836
And now she's a mole.

39:38.919 --> 39:40.504
All this time
we've been in the dark,

39:40.588 --> 39:42.923
having no idea
what Henry and
Moloch are planning.

39:43.007 --> 39:44.592
Now, we have a way
to find out.

39:44.675 --> 39:46.177
It's thanks to your wife.

39:46.260 --> 39:48.971
She's already revealed
news about Henry.

39:49.055 --> 39:51.557
They're designing again
for Moloch's rise.

39:52.308 --> 39:54.143
This time we'll
get ahead of them.

39:57.980 --> 40:01.400
I have got to go
check on Jenny.

40:06.572 --> 40:08.365
She'll be okay, Crane.

40:10.201 --> 40:11.786
Thank you, Lieutenant.

40:23.714 --> 40:25.091
Am I getting out
for good behavior?

40:25.633 --> 40:27.093
That would be a first.

40:27.176 --> 40:28.636
So, you springing me
out of here or what?

40:28.844 --> 40:29.845
Uh...

40:29.929 --> 40:31.138
Working on it.

40:31.222 --> 40:33.307
But this new sheriff
means business,

40:33.390 --> 40:34.934
so we got to play
this one by the book.

40:35.017 --> 40:37.186
If we plan on taking
Henry and Moloch,

40:37.269 --> 40:39.063
we can't be fighting
a war on two fronts.

40:39.146 --> 40:40.397
So just sit tight.

40:40.481 --> 40:41.982
That's easy
for you to say.

40:42.983 --> 40:45.945
You took one for the team.
And I really appreciate it.

40:48.864 --> 40:50.324
Mills.

40:52.243 --> 40:55.371
Just don't take 13 years
to come get me
this time, okay?

41:01.210 --> 41:02.878
Might be time for
another sedative.

41:04.713 --> 41:06.757
Getting a front-row seat
for the electroshock?

41:06.841 --> 41:08.551
What's next on the program,
a lobotomy?

41:08.634 --> 41:10.636
Captain,
I get no pleasure out
of seeing you suffer.

41:11.220 --> 41:13.139
Two officers in your
department are dead.

41:13.222 --> 41:15.850
And last night, two more
decapitated bodies
showed up in town.

41:15.933 --> 41:17.309
Something is
going on around here.

41:17.393 --> 41:19.145
And I think you
know more about this
than you're saying.

41:19.228 --> 41:20.271
Don't you?

41:20.354 --> 41:21.355
I used to be
just like you.

41:21.438 --> 41:23.399
I thought I had
it all figured out.

41:23.482 --> 41:25.234
But then I came
to Sleepy Hollow.

41:25.317 --> 41:26.694
And now that I've
seen what I've seen,

41:26.777 --> 41:28.779
I'm not gonna pretend
to be blind again.

41:29.697 --> 41:32.408
The end is near.

41:33.659 --> 41:34.743
Excuse me.

41:34.827 --> 41:36.495
Can I help you?
I believe so.

41:36.579 --> 41:38.455
I'm Henry Parish.

41:38.539 --> 41:40.166
I'm Captain Irving's attorney.

41:40.249 --> 41:42.835
This isn't an interrogation,
he doesn't need a lawyer.

41:42.918 --> 41:44.712
Everyone needs a lawyer.

41:44.795 --> 41:47.673
Especially a man facing life
in a hellhole like this.

41:48.424 --> 41:50.551
An injunction

41:50.634 --> 41:53.262
against all
involuntary treatments.

41:53.929 --> 41:57.308
Now, if you don't mind,
I would like to speak
to my client in private.

42:02.479 --> 42:04.481
These won't be
necessary anymore.

42:04.565 --> 42:06.192
Cynthia told me she was
getting a new lawyer,

42:06.275 --> 42:07.860
but I thought it would
take a while to process.

42:08.444 --> 42:11.113
There's always a way
to expedite things.

42:11.197 --> 42:13.824
You'll find that I
can be very persuasive.

42:13.908 --> 42:15.784
What else have you
heard about me?

42:16.285 --> 42:18.287
Only that my wife
thinks you can help.

42:18.871 --> 42:20.331
And I will.

42:20.414 --> 42:21.624
One more thing.

42:21.707 --> 42:24.043
I just need you
to sign this.

42:25.211 --> 42:26.587
It's quite standard.

42:26.670 --> 42:29.673
A confirmation
that you're
enlisting my services.

42:30.633 --> 42:32.301
Here's a pen.

42:38.140 --> 42:41.060
Oh, I'm so sorry.
It's a family heirloom.

42:41.977 --> 42:45.814
Hmm. I suppose over the years
it's developed
some rough edges.

42:47.775 --> 42:49.318
It happens to
all of us, right?

42:49.401 --> 42:52.529
Yes! Yes.
Yes, it does.
