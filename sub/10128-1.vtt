00:25.200 --> 00:26.467
ON<i>BOY MEETS WORLD...</i>

00:26.467 --> 00:28.000
WE'RE HAVING A BABY.

00:28.000 --> 00:29.300
YOU'RE HAVING A BABY?

00:29.300 --> 00:30.567
I'M RETIRING.

00:30.567 --> 00:31.867
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
BY THAT?

00:31.867 --> 00:33.133
MR. FEENY SAID
I SHOULD GO TO YALE

00:33.133 --> 00:35.200
UNLESS I HAVE
A REALLY GOOD
REASON NOT TO.

00:35.200 --> 00:37.233
WELL, THERE ISN'T
ANY GOOD REASON.

00:37.233 --> 00:38.233
ACTUALLY, THERE IS.

00:38.233 --> 00:39.233
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

00:39.233 --> 00:41.000
THE JOHN ADAMS
HIGH SCHOOL

00:41.000 --> 00:43.867
CLASS OF 1998.

00:43.867 --> 00:45.300
WILL YOU MARRY ME?

00:45.300 --> 00:47.400
Students: WHOO!

00:55.667 --> 00:57.500
CORY?

00:58.567 --> 01:00.500
DID I JUST ASK YOU
TO MARRY ME?

01:00.500 --> 01:01.734
I ASKED YOU.

01:01.734 --> 01:05.500
B-B-BUT I ALWAYS THOUGHT
I'D BE THE ONE TO PROPOSE.

01:05.500 --> 01:07.367
WELL, I BEAT YOU
TO IT.

01:07.367 --> 01:09.033
CORY, IF YOU WANT
TO BE THE ONE--

01:09.033 --> 01:10.934
NO, NO, NO, NO.
THIS IS THE NINETIES.

01:10.934 --> 01:12.367
WHAT'S DONE IS DONE.

01:12.367 --> 01:15.567
SO, OK, YOU PROPOSED.

01:15.567 --> 01:17.600
HEY, WE BETTER GET TO THAT
GRADUATION PARTY.

01:17.600 --> 01:18.934
I'D LIKE AN ANSWER,
CORY.

01:18.934 --> 01:21.600
AND I'M GOING
TO GIVE IT TO YOU.

01:21.600 --> 01:22.834
BUT, YOU KNOW, TOPANGA,
IT'S NOT EVERY DAY

01:22.834 --> 01:25.467
THAT A GUY GETS ASKED
A QUESTION LIKE THAT,

01:25.467 --> 01:28.667
AND IT'S NOT EVERY DAY
I CAN GIVE YOU AN--

01:37.900 --> 01:40.367
SO YOU GOT A RING
FOR ME, OR WHAT?

01:46.867 --> 01:47.867
TOPANGA, LISTEN.

01:47.867 --> 01:48.867
I WANT TO BE
WITH YOU

01:48.867 --> 01:50.967
MORE THAN ANYTHING
IN THE WORLD, OK?

01:50.967 --> 01:54.100
BUT I CANNOT LET YOU
GIVE UP YALE FOR ME.

01:54.100 --> 01:56.367
DO YOU HONESTLY
WANT ME TO GO TO YALE?

01:56.367 --> 01:57.367
NO.

01:57.367 --> 01:58.867
THEN SHUT UP
ABOUT IT.

01:58.867 --> 02:00.200
PENNBROOK
IS A GREAT SCHOOL.

02:00.200 --> 02:01.967
I'M GOING TO GET
A GREAT EDUCATION.

02:01.967 --> 02:06.100
BESIDES, WHAT GOOD IS COLLEGE
WITHOUT THIS FACE?

02:06.100 --> 02:09.400
IT'S NO GOOD.
IT'S NO GOOD AT ALL.

02:09.400 --> 02:11.100
SO WHEN DO YOU
WANT TO DO IT?

02:11.100 --> 02:12.100
DO WHAT?

02:12.100 --> 02:13.100
GET MARRIED, CORY.

02:13.100 --> 02:14.300
TOPANGA,
I DON'T KNOW.

02:14.300 --> 02:15.400
I HAVEN'T EVEN HAD
TIME TO THINK--

02:15.400 --> 02:16.400
HOW ABOUT RIGHT AWAY?

02:16.400 --> 02:17.767
RIGHT AWAY?
RIGHT AWAY WHEN?

02:17.767 --> 02:19.767
CORY, WE'VE BEEN
DATING EACH OTHER
SINCE WE WERE 2.

02:19.767 --> 02:22.000
WE'VE BOTH HAD A CHANCE
TO BE WITH OTHER PEOPLE.

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
YEAH, I WONDER
WHAT SHE'S DOING.

02:25.467 --> 02:27.467
DO YOU THINK
WE'LL BE TOGETHER FOR
THE REST OF OUR LIVES?

02:27.467 --> 02:28.967
YEAH,
I KNOW WE WILL.

02:28.967 --> 02:31.567
SO DO I. WE'RE NOT LIKE
OTHER PEOPLE, CORY.

02:31.567 --> 02:34.100
WE'RE WEIRD.
LET'S JUST DO IT.

02:34.100 --> 02:38.800
PLUS, I WANT TO HAVE
TIME FOR OUR HONEYMOON
BEFORE COLLEGE STARTS.

02:38.800 --> 02:39.967
A HONEYMOON, HUH?

02:39.967 --> 02:41.033
MM-HMM.

02:41.033 --> 02:43.367
AND--AND ON
THIS HONEYMOON,

02:43.367 --> 02:44.667
YOU AND I,
WE'D PROBABLY--

02:44.667 --> 02:46.867
THERE'S
A GOOD CHANCE, YEAH.

02:46.867 --> 02:48.500
A GOOD CHANCE.
KEEP TALKING.

02:48.500 --> 02:50.100
LET'S GO TELL
YOUR PARENTS.
NO!

02:50.100 --> 02:53.100
I MEAN, NO, I DON'T THINK
WE SHOULD TELL MY PARENTS.

02:53.100 --> 02:54.200
THEY'RE GOING THROUGH
A LOT RIGHT NOW

02:54.200 --> 02:55.300
WITH THE BABY COMING
AND EVERYTHING,

02:55.300 --> 02:57.033
AND I DON'T KNOW
IF THEY'D UNDERSTAND.

02:57.033 --> 02:59.834
IN FACT,
THEY'RE INCAPABLE
OF UNDERSTANDING.

02:59.834 --> 03:02.300
I DON'T THINK
WE SHOULD TELL ANYONE.

03:02.300 --> 03:04.233
YOU KNOW,
UNTIL WE FIGURE OUT

03:04.233 --> 03:05.467
WHAT WE'RE
GOING TO DO.

03:05.467 --> 03:07.500
CORY, YOU DO WANT TO
MARRY ME, DON'T YOU?

03:07.500 --> 03:08.967
YEAH. I JUST--

03:08.967 --> 03:10.900
I DON'T WANT EVERYONE
STICKING THEIR NOSES
IN OUR BUSINESS.

03:10.900 --> 03:12.667
YOU KNOW, I MEAN,
THIS IS OUR LIVES.

03:12.667 --> 03:14.200
THIS IS FOR US
TO DECIDE.

03:14.200 --> 03:16.834
OK, PROMISE YOU
WON'T TELL A SOUL.

03:16.834 --> 03:18.000
OK, I PROMISE.

03:18.000 --> 03:20.934
I KIND OF LIKE IT.
IT'S VERY ROMEO AND JULIET.

03:20.934 --> 03:23.200
HA HA. THAT'S WHY WE'RE
NOT TELLING ANYONE.

03:23.200 --> 03:25.000
WHATEVER YOU NEED.

03:25.000 --> 03:26.567
SO ARE WE ENGAGED,
OR WHAT?

03:26.567 --> 03:28.467
YEAH, IF YOU DON'T
OPEN UP YOUR BIG MOUTH.

03:28.467 --> 03:30.367
YOU.

03:30.367 --> 03:32.567
CONGRATULATIONS,
YOU TWO.

03:32.567 --> 03:34.767
OH, MY GOD,
HE KNOWS.

03:36.100 --> 03:38.667
CORY, MR. FEENY IS
CONGRATULATING US
ON GRADUATING,

03:38.667 --> 03:40.867
SO, UH, WHY DON'T
YOU THANK HIM?

03:40.867 --> 03:42.500
IS THERE
SOMETHING ELSE?

03:42.500 --> 03:44.300
NOTHING.
GET OFF MY BACK!

03:45.400 --> 03:46.767
WHATEVER YOU SAY.

03:46.767 --> 03:50.767
HO HO HO HO.
YOU'RE A SMUG ONE,
AREN'T YOU, GEORGE?

03:50.767 --> 03:52.834
<i>YOU </i>KNOW YOU KNOW,
<i>I </i>KNOW YOU KNOW.

03:52.834 --> 03:54.767
I DON'T KNOW
HOW YOU KNOW,

03:54.767 --> 03:56.600
BUT I KNOW
THAT YOU KNOW.

03:56.600 --> 04:00.300
ALL RIGHT, I KNOW.
I KNOW EVERYTHING.

04:00.300 --> 04:02.300
NOW, WHAT
IN THE WORLD ARE
YOU TALKING ABOUT?

04:02.300 --> 04:07.100
NOTHING. THIS GETS OUT,
I'LL HUNT YOU DOWN
LIKE A DOG!

04:09.100 --> 04:11.100
[KNOCKING]

04:12.200 --> 04:13.300
HOW YOU DOING?

04:13.300 --> 04:15.200
TOPANGA ASKED YOU
TO MARRY HER.

04:15.200 --> 04:17.600
I HATE YOU.

04:17.600 --> 04:19.767
YOU GUYS
ARE SO WEIRD.

04:19.767 --> 04:21.200
I KNOW, BUT I LOVE HIM,

04:21.200 --> 04:23.567
AND I WANT TO BE
WITH HIM TILL HE DIES.

04:23.567 --> 04:26.233
BUT YOU CAN'T TELL
ANYONE, NOT EVEN SHAWN.

04:26.233 --> 04:27.800
FEENY TOLD YOU,
DIDN'T HE?

04:27.800 --> 04:30.100
I'M GOING TO FIND HIM
AND RIP HIM APART!

04:30.100 --> 04:32.133
I WAS SITTING
RIGHT NEXT TO YOU,
YOU DOPE.

04:32.133 --> 04:33.500
I HEARD EVERYTHING.

04:33.500 --> 04:34.934
THAT'S WHY HE
LOOKED SO SCARED.

04:34.934 --> 04:35.934
I DON'T THINK
HE WAS SCARED.

04:35.934 --> 04:37.567
I JUST THINK HE WAS
A LITTLE FLUSTERED.

04:37.567 --> 04:40.233
I WAS A LITTLE FLUSTERED,
THAT'S ALL.

04:40.233 --> 04:41.867
YOU LOOKED LIKE
SOMEBODY SHOT YOU
IN THE HEAD.

04:41.867 --> 04:43.133
BUT, HEY, I DON'T
BLAME YOU.

04:43.133 --> 04:44.367
YOU KNOW, IF ANGELA
ASKED ME THAT

04:44.367 --> 04:45.900
IN THE MIDDLE
OF MY GRADUATION,

04:45.900 --> 04:47.900
I'D WET MY GOWN,
TOO.

04:49.233 --> 04:52.200
GIRL, AT OUR AGE,
WE ARE SUPPOSED
TO BE HAVING FUN,

04:52.200 --> 04:53.200
NOT GETTING MARRIED.

04:53.200 --> 04:55.000
WHAT IDIOT
DOESN'T KNOW THAT?

04:55.000 --> 04:56.400
MARRY HER.
WHAT?

04:56.400 --> 04:58.200
I THINK YOU SHOULD
MARRY HER.

04:58.200 --> 05:00.100
SHAWN, THAT'S NOT WHAT
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO SAY.

05:00.100 --> 05:02.400
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO SAY
THAT YOU THINK WE'RE CRAZY.

05:02.400 --> 05:03.667
WELL, YOU'RE CRAZY
IF YOU THINK

05:03.667 --> 05:06.734
YOU HAVEN'T BEEN
MARRIED TO HER
YOUR ENTIRE LIFE.

05:06.734 --> 05:09.467
YOU MIGHT AS WELL
GET PRESENTS.

05:09.467 --> 05:12.934
WELL, I DO NEED
A NEW TOASTER, BUT NO.

05:12.934 --> 05:15.567
NO. RUSHING INTO
MARRIAGE RIGHT NOW

05:15.567 --> 05:16.767
IS WAY TOO OVERWHELMING,

05:16.767 --> 05:19.800
WHAT WITH
HIGH SCHOOL ENDING,
COLLEGE STARTING.

05:19.800 --> 05:21.367
AND YOU'RE SCARED
TO TELL YOUR PARENTS.

05:21.367 --> 05:24.767
WELL, I SEE
NO REASON WHY THEY
EVER HAVE TO KNOW.

05:24.767 --> 05:28.000
WELL, IF WE'RE DONE
TALKING ABOUT YOU,
I'VE GOT SOME NEWS.

05:28.000 --> 05:31.200
WELL, WE'RE NOT DONE
TALKING ABOUT ME.
HOW SELFISH ARE YOU?

05:31.200 --> 05:32.500
CORE--

05:32.500 --> 05:34.100
I THINK I'M GOING
TO TAKE SOME COURSES
AT PENNBROOK.

05:34.100 --> 05:35.300
GOOD.
HAVE A NICE DAY.

05:35.300 --> 05:36.400
WHICH MEANS...

05:36.400 --> 05:37.767
THAT I'M GOING TO BE
LIVING IN THE DORMS,

05:37.767 --> 05:39.900
SO IF YOU'RE NOT READY
TO HAVE TOPANGA
AS A ROOMMATE...

05:39.900 --> 05:41.000
YOU AND ME TOGETHER?

05:41.000 --> 05:43.567
THAT'S 2 PROPOSALS
IN THE SAME DAY, SHAWN.

05:43.567 --> 05:47.834
I--I MUST BE
THE LUCKIEST BOY
IN THE WORLD.

05:48.934 --> 05:50.200
WELL, SHAWNY...
YEAH.

05:50.200 --> 05:52.400
I'M GLAD YOU DECIDED
TO GO TO COLLEGE, BUD.

05:52.400 --> 05:54.734
THANKS.

05:54.734 --> 05:56.200
WAIT A MINUTE.
WHAT'S HE TALKING ABOUT?

05:56.200 --> 05:58.200
YEAH, I'M GOING
TO TAKE SOME
COLLEGE COURSES.

05:58.200 --> 06:00.100
I LOVE MY JOB,
BUT THERE'S
MORE TO LIFE

06:00.100 --> 06:02.934
THAN PHOTOGRAPHING
NAKED LADIES.

06:02.934 --> 06:05.700
OH, HEY,
THAT'S GREAT, BUDDY.
YOU'RE GOING TO COLLEGE.

06:05.700 --> 06:06.800
ALL RIGHT.

06:06.800 --> 06:08.767
THERE'S NO MORE TO LIFE
THAN NAKED LADIES.

06:08.767 --> 06:13.300
EXCEPT MAYBE NAKED LADIES
THAT WEAR REALLY TIGHT SHIRTS
AND REALLY TIGHT PANTS.

06:18.200 --> 06:20.033
LOOK, I'M PROUD
OF YOU, OK?

06:20.033 --> 06:24.000
PROBLEM WITH YOU
IS YOU DON'T KNOW HOW
TO BE SUPPORTIVE, OK?

06:24.000 --> 06:26.467
I WANT YOU
TO BE SUPPORTIVE.

06:26.467 --> 06:28.233
SORRY. I'LL TRY.

06:28.233 --> 06:30.467
WELL, YOU KNOW,
THIS MEANS SHAWN AND I
ARE GOING TO BE ROOMMATES.

06:30.467 --> 06:31.500
WHAT?

06:31.500 --> 06:33.500
I SUPPORT THAT.

06:33.500 --> 06:34.600
UNBELIEVABLE.

06:34.600 --> 06:37.033
I SUPPORT THAT.

06:37.033 --> 06:38.400
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU.

06:38.400 --> 06:42.500
I'M SO PROUD
OF YOU!

06:43.567 --> 06:44.567
YEAH, THAT'S GREAT.

06:44.567 --> 06:46.300
ALL RIGHT.
GOOD JOB.

06:47.934 --> 06:49.000
PLEASE
DON'T MOVE OUT.

06:49.000 --> 06:50.400
HEY, SCHOOL DOESN'T
START FOR 2 MONTHS.

06:50.400 --> 06:52.800
YOU GUYS SHOULD
HAVE PLENTY OF TIME
TO FIND A NEW ROOMMATE.

06:52.800 --> 06:54.200
CANNOT BE DONE!

06:54.200 --> 06:55.200
WE ARE VERY
PARTICULAR.

06:55.200 --> 06:57.800
WE GOT STRICT
REQUIREMENTS.

06:57.800 --> 06:59.600
I GIVE UP
A SCHOLARSHIP TO YALE

06:59.600 --> 07:01.400
TO MOVE TO PHILADELPHIA
WITH YOU, AND...

07:01.400 --> 07:05.467
YOU TELL ME YOU'RE
GOING TO CORPUS CHRISTI
TO FIND YOURSELF?

07:05.467 --> 07:09.567
YOU KNOW WHAT?
FIND THIS.

07:10.700 --> 07:11.734
SHE PRETTY.

07:11.734 --> 07:13.800
THAT A LOT OF WOMAN.

07:13.800 --> 07:16.567
"FIND THIS."
GOD, THAT DOESN'T EVEN
MAKE ANY SENSE, DOES IT?

07:16.567 --> 07:21.600
I THINK YOU DID
A WONDERFUL JOB,
AND I SUPPORT YOU.

07:21.600 --> 07:25.233
YOU KNOW,
AND I REALLY THOUGHT
THAT WE LOVED EACH OTHER.

07:25.233 --> 07:27.200
AND NOW I HAVE
NO PLACE TO STAY.

07:27.200 --> 07:28.600
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I'M GOING TO DO.

07:28.600 --> 07:31.000
OH, MAN,
I DON'T ENVY YOU.

07:35.800 --> 07:38.967
HEY, WHAT'S ALL MY STUFF
DOING OUT IN THE HALLWAY?

07:38.967 --> 07:40.100
OH, YEAH. WE FOUND
A NEW ROOMMATE.

07:40.100 --> 07:42.100
GET OUT.
HERE, I'LL HELP.

07:42.100 --> 07:43.567
SCHOOL DOESN'T START
FOR 2 MONTHS.

07:43.567 --> 07:45.200
WELL, THE FUNNY THING
IS WE FOUND SOMEONE

07:45.200 --> 07:47.200
WHO MEETS EVERY ONE OF
OUR STRICT REQUIREMENTS.

07:47.200 --> 07:49.967
I'M GOING TO HAVE
TO TELL THIS GUY THAT
HE CAN'T MOVE IN HERE

07:49.967 --> 07:51.734
TILL I'M GOOD AND READY
TO MOVE OUT.

07:51.734 --> 07:56.467
HEY, DO YOU GUYS
HAVE ANY TOOTHPASTE
I COULD BORROW?

07:56.467 --> 07:57.767
HI.

07:58.834 --> 07:59.867
LET ME HELP YOU HERE.

07:59.867 --> 08:00.800
YEAH, JUST GRAB SOME

08:00.800 --> 08:02.100
AND CHUCK IT RIGHT OUT
THE DOOR THERE.

08:02.100 --> 08:03.100
THERE YOU GO.

08:03.100 --> 08:06.400
GOOD, GOOD. WELL--

08:16.000 --> 08:17.133
HEY, HEY, COME HERE.

08:17.133 --> 08:19.500
YOU DIDN'T TELL
ANGELA ABOUT US,
DID YOU?

08:19.500 --> 08:21.000
I WOULD NEVER. WHY?

08:21.000 --> 08:23.667
SHE WAS SHOOTING ME
NASTY LOOKS AT DINNER,

08:23.667 --> 08:25.600
AND I ALMOST DIDN'T
ENJOY MY PUDDING.

08:25.600 --> 08:27.100
DID YOU SAY ANYTHING
TO SHAWN ABOUT US

08:27.100 --> 08:29.200
BECAUSE I THINK
HE'S BEEN WINKING AT ME.

08:29.200 --> 08:32.033
UH! I WOULD NEVER.

08:32.033 --> 08:34.100
HEY, I KNOW HOW
TO KEEP A SECRET.

08:34.100 --> 08:35.600
NOW, REMEMBER,
MY PARENTS
ARE IN THERE,

08:35.600 --> 08:37.300
SO JUST ACT NATURAL.

08:39.367 --> 08:41.834
COREY, SHAWN JUST
TOLD US THE BIG NEWS.

08:41.834 --> 08:43.033
WHY DIDN'T YOU
SAY ANYTHING?

08:43.033 --> 08:44.300
YOU TOLD THEM!
YOU TOLD SHAWN?

08:44.300 --> 08:47.934
OH, OF COURSE
I TOLD SHAWN!
AREN'T YOU ANGRY?

08:47.934 --> 08:49.600
WELL, YOU GUYS HAVE
BEEN TOGETHER FOREVER.

08:49.600 --> 08:51.000
WHY WOULD I BE ANGRY?

08:51.000 --> 08:53.967
HA HA HA. WHOO!

08:53.967 --> 08:56.133
TALK ABOUT A LOAD
OFF MY MIND, HUH?

08:56.133 --> 08:59.200
I THINK YOU AND SHAWN
WILL BE VERY HAPPY
TOGETHER AS ROOMMATES.

08:59.200 --> 09:00.600
YOU AND SHAWN?
WHAT ABOUT US?

09:00.600 --> 09:02.667
TOPANGA, I DON'T
THINK THE SCHOOL

09:02.667 --> 09:07.400
WOULD ALLOW YOU AND CORY
TO BE ROOMMATES
UNLESS YOU WERE MARRIED.

09:07.400 --> 09:08.600
HERE'S WHERE I'M DEAD.

09:08.600 --> 09:10.400
I THOUGHT WE WERE
GOING TO DECIDE
THIS TOGETHER.

09:10.400 --> 09:11.967
WELL, I WAS GOING
TO DISCUSS IT.

09:11.967 --> 09:13.200
HEY, YOU KNEW
ABOUT IT, TOO?

09:13.200 --> 09:14.300
YOU TOLD ANGELA?

09:14.300 --> 09:15.767
YOU TOLD SHAWN.
WHY DIDN'T
YOU TELL ME?

09:15.767 --> 09:17.000
YOU DIDN'T TELL ME.

09:17.000 --> 09:20.000
HEY, EVERYBODY.
GOT THIS NEW ROOMMATE.
SHE IS FINE!

09:23.500 --> 09:27.500
ALL RIGHT,
I'D KIND OF LIKE TO KNOW
WHAT IS GOING ON NOW.

09:29.300 --> 09:32.400
OK, DAD, UH,
SEE, HA HA HA,

09:32.400 --> 09:36.500
TOPANGA AND I ARE,
YOU KNOW, UH, HA HA HA.

09:36.500 --> 09:39.100
IT'S--IT'S REALLY
KIND OF AMUSING
IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT.

09:39.100 --> 09:42.500
UH, SEE, WHAT'S GOING
TO HAPPEN IS, UM--

09:42.500 --> 09:44.200
CORY AND I ARE
GETTING MARRIED.

09:46.834 --> 09:49.767
ARE YOU
OUT OF YOUR MINDS?

09:49.767 --> 09:51.233
WHY?
'CAUSE THEY LOVE
EACH OTHER.

09:51.233 --> 09:53.700
NO, THAT'S NOT A REASON.
THEY ARE TOO YOUNG.

09:53.700 --> 09:55.734
YOU CAN'T EVEN
CLEAN UP YOUR ROOM.

09:55.734 --> 09:56.867
I'M GOING
TO GET TO IT.

09:56.867 --> 09:58.800
YOU'LL WAIT UNTIL
YOU FINISH COLLEGE.

09:58.800 --> 09:59.800
OF COURSE
THEY'LL WAIT.

09:59.800 --> 10:01.100
THEY HAVEN'T DECIDED
ANYTHING YET.

10:01.100 --> 10:02.500
WHOSE IDIOT IDEA
WAS THIS?

10:02.500 --> 10:04.934
MINE. IT WAS
MY IDIOT IDEA.

10:04.934 --> 10:06.033
IT'S MY IDIOT LIFE,

10:06.033 --> 10:07.033
AND I HAVE
THE RIGHT TO DECIDE

10:07.033 --> 10:08.934
IF I WANT TO BE
A MARRIED IDIOT.

10:08.934 --> 10:10.100
I ASKED CORY
TO MARRY ME.

10:10.100 --> 10:11.667
PLEASE DON'T YELL
AT MY FIANCéE.

10:11.667 --> 10:14.100
TOPANGA, I THOUGHT
YOU HAD MORE SENSE.

10:14.100 --> 10:16.667
I ASKED BOBBY PEPLOWSKI
TO MARRY ME,

10:16.667 --> 10:18.500
THEN HE KICKED ME.

10:18.500 --> 10:21.734
HAVE YOU THOUGHT OF
THE RESPONSIBILITIES YOUR
GONNA HAVE?

10:21.734 --> 10:22.900
NO, THEY HAVEN'T.

10:22.900 --> 10:24.300
THEY HAVEN'T THOUGHT
OF ANYTHING.

10:24.300 --> 10:25.900
OK, ANGELA,
LET'S JUST STAY
OUT OF THIS.

10:25.900 --> 10:27.033
NO. THESE ARE
OUR FRIENDS.

10:27.033 --> 10:28.467
HOW CAN YOU LET THEM
RUIN THEIR LIVES?

10:28.467 --> 10:32.400
THEY'RE NOT LIKE US.
THEY'RE HOPELESSLY
IN LOVE.

10:33.467 --> 10:36.133
AND SO ARE WE.
SO ARE WE.

10:36.133 --> 10:38.300
WE HAVE PAID
FOR YOUR FOOD,
FOR YOUR CLOTHES,

10:38.300 --> 10:40.467
FOR YOUR PHONE,
FOR YOUR CAR INSURANCE.

10:40.467 --> 10:43.000
YOU THINK YOU CAN
HANDLE ALL THAT?

10:43.000 --> 10:45.467
YOU TWO GOT MARRIED
WHEN YOU WERE MY AGE, RIGHT?

10:45.467 --> 10:46.900
I WAS A DOPE.

10:50.734 --> 10:52.133
I--I TAKE THAT BACK.

10:52.133 --> 10:53.700
WHAT I MEAN, WHAT
I'M TRYING TO SAY

10:53.700 --> 10:56.100
IS THINK OF ALL
THE THINGS IN LIFE

10:56.100 --> 10:57.700
YOU'LL BE
MISSING OUT ON.

10:57.700 --> 10:58.834
DAD,
TOPANGA AND I--

10:58.834 --> 11:00.233
NO, NO,
YOU THINK YOU KNOW

11:00.233 --> 11:01.400
WHAT YOU WANT
FROM YOUR LIFE, HUH?

11:01.400 --> 11:03.100
YOU THINK YOU'VE GOT IT
ALL FIGURED OUT.

11:03.100 --> 11:05.867
WELL, THINGS DON'T
ALWAYS TURN OUT
THE WAY YOU PLAN.

11:05.867 --> 11:07.100
SO, IF YOU'RE GOING
TO DO THIS,

11:07.100 --> 11:10.033
YOU BETTER PREPARE
TO MAKE SACRIFICES.

11:10.033 --> 11:13.567
WHAT SACRIFICES
DID YOU MAKE, ALAN?

11:13.567 --> 11:14.800
WHAT?

11:14.800 --> 11:16.500
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
WE'RE NOT
HOPELESSLY IN LOVE?

11:16.500 --> 11:17.867
WHAT?

11:17.867 --> 11:19.367
Alan: I'M JUST TRYING
TO MAKE A POINT
TO THE KIDS.

11:19.367 --> 11:20.934
NO, LISTEN. YOU'RE
NOT LISTENING TO ME.

11:20.934 --> 11:23.133
[EVERYBODY TALKS AT ONCE]

11:23.133 --> 11:24.567
WELL, THEY'RE TAKING IT
BETTER THAN I THOUGHT.

11:24.567 --> 11:26.734
IT ISN'T FOR THEM
TO DECIDE.

11:26.734 --> 11:28.400
OK, THIS IS
OUR LIVES, TOPANGA.

11:28.400 --> 11:31.033
NOBODY IS GOING TO
TELL US WHAT TO DO.

11:31.834 --> 11:34.400
COME ON. WE'RE
GETTING MARRIED.

11:40.300 --> 11:43.100
[ALL TALKING AT ONCE]

11:43.100 --> 11:45.400
HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY,
HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY.

11:45.400 --> 11:46.867
IF EVERYBODY WILL
JUST CALM DOWN,

11:46.867 --> 11:49.400
I THINK I CAN
BE THE VOICE
OF REASON HERE.

11:49.400 --> 11:52.100
[ALL LAUGH]

11:52.100 --> 11:53.100
[ALL TALKING AT ONCE]

11:53.100 --> 11:54.500
I THINK THEY
SHOULD GET MARRIED.

11:54.500 --> 11:55.800
AMEN.

11:55.800 --> 11:56.800
STOP IT, SHAWN.

11:56.800 --> 11:57.934
ERIC, SIT DOWN!
THANK YOU, DAD.

11:57.934 --> 11:59.200
ALL RIGHT, LISTEN.

11:59.200 --> 12:01.667
THE CHANCES
THAT CORY COULD FIND
A WOMAN LIKE TOPANGA

12:01.667 --> 12:02.867
ARE, LIKE,
ONE IN A MILLION.

12:02.867 --> 12:03.900
THERE'S NOBODY BETTER.

12:03.900 --> 12:04.900
WELL, IT'S TRUE.

12:04.900 --> 12:06.133
OH, WE ALL LOVE TOPANGA.

12:06.133 --> 12:07.367
THAT'S NOT THE ISSUE.

12:07.367 --> 12:08.667
YES, BUT, SEE,
IN A FEW YEARS,

12:08.667 --> 12:09.667
SHE'S GOING
TO DRY UP.

12:09.667 --> 12:11.400
SHE'S GOING
TO GET ALL WRINKLY.

12:11.400 --> 12:13.467
MIGHT AS WELL
JUST GRAB HER WHILE
SHE'S STILL SMOOTH.

12:13.467 --> 12:15.867
AM I RIGHT THERE, DAD?

12:15.867 --> 12:18.500
YOU'RE AN IMBECILE.

12:18.500 --> 12:20.000
HA HA HA.

12:20.000 --> 12:23.967
HAVE ANY OF YOU GUYS
NOTICED THAT CORY
AND TOPANGA AREN'T HERE?

12:36.100 --> 12:38.700
CORY, ARE YOU POSITIVE
YOU WANT TO DO THIS?

12:38.700 --> 12:40.133
WE'RE IN THE CAR,
AREN'T WE?

12:40.133 --> 12:41.367
YEAH, I KNOW, BUT YOU'RE
NOT JUST DOING THIS

12:41.367 --> 12:43.367
BECAUSE YOUR PARENTS
ARE AGAINST IT?

12:43.367 --> 12:46.300
TOPANGA, I TOLD YOU,
IT'S MY LIFE.

12:46.300 --> 12:48.100
I DECIDE WHAT I WANT
TO DO WITH IT.

12:48.100 --> 12:49.767
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN
YOU GET TO COLLEGE

12:49.767 --> 12:51.734
AND YOU SEE EVERYBODY
MEETING EACH OTHER

12:51.734 --> 12:53.300
AND DATING
AND HAVING FUN?

12:53.300 --> 12:56.300
ARE YOU GOING TO WISH
YOU COULD BE DOING
THE SAME THING?

12:56.300 --> 12:57.867
WELL, IT
DIDN'T PHASE ME
IN HIGH SCHOOL,

12:57.867 --> 12:59.767
WHY SHOULD IT
PHASE ME NOW?

13:02.100 --> 13:05.400
CORY,
YOU HAD YOUR HEART SET ON
THIS BIG, ROMANTIC WEDDING.

13:05.400 --> 13:07.600
TOPANGA, I CAN'T
THINK OF ANYTHING
MORE ROMANTIC

13:07.600 --> 13:10.100
THAN SNEAKING OFF
TO A QUIET LITTLE
WEDDING CHAPEL

13:10.100 --> 13:11.700
IN THE COUNTRY.

13:11.700 --> 13:13.200
I WANT TO MARRY YOU.

13:13.200 --> 13:15.967
THAT'S WHAT I HAVE
MY HEART SET ON.

13:15.967 --> 13:17.367
I DO.

13:18.400 --> 13:20.100
THEN WHY DID YOU
PASS THE EXIT?

13:20.100 --> 13:21.667
STOP HOUNDING ME.

13:23.400 --> 13:25.300
YEAH, WELL, WE SAID
SOME PRETTY AWFUL THINGS.

13:25.300 --> 13:27.133
NO. WE JUST
TOLD THEM THE TRUTH.

13:27.133 --> 13:28.767
THEY PROBABLY JUST WENT
TO THINK THINGS OVER.

13:28.767 --> 13:30.300
I BET THEY ELOPED.

13:30.300 --> 13:31.900
WITHOUT
OUR PERMISSION?

13:31.900 --> 13:34.133
CORY? HUH,
I DON'T THINK SO.

13:34.133 --> 13:35.767
HEY, I KNOW HIM.
IF HE'S FORCED TO CHOOSE

13:35.767 --> 13:38.300
BETWEEN ANYTHING
AND TOPANGA,
IT'S NO CONTEST.

13:38.300 --> 13:41.567
REMEMBER WHEN WE TOLD
YOUR FATHER WE WERE
GOING TO GET MARRIED?

13:41.567 --> 13:42.800
WHAT DID WE DO?

13:42.800 --> 13:43.867
WELL, THAT WAS
DIFFERENT.

13:43.867 --> 13:45.300
I MEAN,
HE WAS STUBBORN,

13:45.300 --> 13:46.400
TOTALLY SET
AGAINST IT,

13:46.400 --> 13:49.934
WOULDN'T LISTEN
TO ANYTHING
WE HAD TO--

13:52.000 --> 13:53.100
OH, BOY!

13:53.100 --> 13:54.300
OH, BOY.

13:54.300 --> 13:55.467
DON'T WORRY
ABOUT IT.

13:55.467 --> 13:57.967
GUYS, CAN I BE
THE VOICE OF REASON
HERE AGAIN?

13:57.967 --> 14:00.100
[ALL LAUGH]

14:00.100 --> 14:01.867
THAT'S GREAT.

14:03.000 --> 14:04.000
MAYBE YOU ARE
RESPONSIBLE.

14:04.000 --> 14:05.400
IN FACT,
I KNOW YOU ARE,

14:05.400 --> 14:08.000
WHAT WITH THE BICKERING
AND THE LECTURING
AND THE YELLING.

14:08.000 --> 14:09.100
OK, ERIC.

14:09.100 --> 14:11.000
WE HAVE TO SUPPORT
CORY AND TOPANGA

14:11.000 --> 14:12.100
AND ACCEPT
THIS MARRIAGE.

14:12.100 --> 14:13.400
WE CAN'T PUSH THEM
OUT OF OUR LIVES

14:13.400 --> 14:14.800
LIKE WE PUSHED THEM
TO ELOPE.

14:14.800 --> 14:18.867
THEY LOVE EACH OTHER,
AND THEY BELONG TOGETHER,

14:18.867 --> 14:20.300
JUST LIKE ME AND RACHEL.

14:22.700 --> 14:23.800
WHO'S RACHEL?

14:23.800 --> 14:26.300
SHE'S MY BEAUTIFUL
NEW ROOMMATE ANGEL.

14:26.300 --> 14:28.600
SHE'S BACK
AT THE APARTMENT
RIGHT NOW WITH JACK.

14:28.600 --> 14:29.900
OH, NO.

14:29.900 --> 14:31.500
WAIT, WHAT IF--WHAT IF
THEY HIT IT OFF

14:31.500 --> 14:34.233
AND SHE CHEATS ON ME?

14:34.233 --> 14:36.500
THAT TRAMP, MAN.

14:37.900 --> 14:40.400
GONNA GET BACK
AND START SLAPPING
SOME PEOPLE AROUND.

14:46.300 --> 14:50.934
IT IS OUR FAULT.
WE DROVE THEM TO IT.

14:54.734 --> 14:55.834
JUDGE BEMIS?

14:55.834 --> 14:56.834
YES.

14:56.834 --> 14:58.000
HI, I'M
CORY MATTHEWS.

14:58.000 --> 14:59.000
WE TALKED
ON THE PHONE.

14:59.000 --> 15:00.900
OH, COME ON IN,
YOUNG MAN.
COME ON IN.

15:00.900 --> 15:04.834
AND, UH, THIS MUST
BE THE BRIDE
WITH THE NUTTY NAME.

15:04.834 --> 15:05.834
TOPANGA.

15:05.834 --> 15:08.000
TOPANGA. HA HA HA.
THAT'S SILLY.

15:08.000 --> 15:11.400
NOW, THIS IS
MY WIFE P-FOOFTA.

15:11.400 --> 15:14.867
OUR ONE FRIEND
CALLS ME FOOFIE.
HOW DO YOU DO?

15:14.867 --> 15:16.600
HOW DO YOU DO?

15:16.600 --> 15:19.000
SHE'LL BE
YOUR WITNESS.

15:19.000 --> 15:23.000
OH, THEY'RE
SO YOUNG, HENRY.

15:23.000 --> 15:26.967
PAY HER NO MIND.
WE'VE BEEN MARRYING FOLKS
FOR 36 YEARS,

15:26.967 --> 15:29.900
AND SHE BAWLS LIKE A BABY
EVERY TIME.

15:29.900 --> 15:32.600
STOP IT!

15:32.600 --> 15:35.734
WE APPRECIATE YOU GUYS
DOING THIS FOR US
AT SUCH A LATE HOUR.

15:35.734 --> 15:38.000
OH, NONSENSE.
THIS IS WHAT WE DO.

15:38.000 --> 15:39.467
BESIDES,
WE CAN'T BE CHOOSY.

15:39.467 --> 15:41.600
EVERYBODY WANTS
A BIG WEDDING THESE DAYS.

15:41.600 --> 15:43.400
NOBODY WANTS
TO ELOPE NO MORE.

15:43.400 --> 15:47.100
WELL, I DO.
RIGHT, CORY?

15:47.100 --> 15:48.233
CORY, SAY I DO.

15:48.233 --> 15:50.200
ALREADY?

15:50.200 --> 15:54.200
SHAWN AND I ARE
VERY DIFFERENT PEOPLE,
BUT WE'RE BROTHERS,

15:54.200 --> 15:56.367
AND THERE'S REALLY
NOTHING WE WOULDN'T
DO FOR EACH OTHER.

15:56.367 --> 15:57.767
THEN WE BEAT
EACH OTHER UP.

15:57.767 --> 16:00.066
YEAH, ME AND MY SISTER
ARE THE SAME WAY.

16:00.066 --> 16:04.133
OH, WELL,
IF YOU'RE EVER HOMESICK
AND YOU WANT TO WRESTLE.

16:04.133 --> 16:05.400
WHAT, ME WRESTLE
WITH YOU?

16:05.400 --> 16:07.200
OH, GOD, NO.
I'M A GIRL.

16:07.200 --> 16:08.400
WHOA!

16:08.400 --> 16:11.300
BUT I AM ONE
BIG OLD GIRL.

16:11.300 --> 16:13.100
FAAAHHH!

16:13.100 --> 16:14.300
HA HA HA.

16:14.300 --> 16:16.834
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.
AAAHHH!

16:16.834 --> 16:19.500
SHE'S SITTING ON ME,
MAN. AHA!

16:19.500 --> 16:21.200
WE WERE JUST
FOOLING AROUND.

16:21.200 --> 16:23.100
OH, NO.
PLEASE DON'T GO.

16:23.100 --> 16:24.100
SO, WHERE
WERE YOU, ERIC?

16:24.100 --> 16:26.300
OH, WELL, I,
WHILE YOU GUYS
WERE HERE

16:26.300 --> 16:27.967
HAVING YOUR
LITTLE SUMO FEST,

16:27.967 --> 16:30.600
I WAS PUTTING
A CRISIS OUT
ON THE HOME FRONT.

16:30.600 --> 16:31.834
IS EVERYTHING OK?

16:31.834 --> 16:34.300
IT IS NOW.
CORY AND TOPANGA,

16:34.300 --> 16:35.567
THAT'S MY LITTLE
BROTHER AND TOPANGA,

16:35.567 --> 16:36.567
THEY RAN OFF
TO ELOPE.

16:36.567 --> 16:37.800
MY PARENTS
KIND OF WENT MENTAL.

16:37.800 --> 16:39.100
I CALMED
EVERYTHING DOWN.

16:39.100 --> 16:40.100
HOW DID YOU DO THAT?

16:40.100 --> 16:42.500
I SAID,
"CALM DOWN, YOU."

16:42.500 --> 16:43.600
OH.

16:43.600 --> 16:45.100
YEP. THEN I
EXPLAINED TO THEM

16:45.100 --> 16:47.000
THAT WE LOVE
BOTH MY BROTHER
AND TOPANGA

16:47.000 --> 16:48.900
AND IT WOULD BE--
IT WOULD
JUST BE BETTER

16:48.900 --> 16:49.934
IF WE ACCEPTED
THE MARRIAGE

16:49.934 --> 16:51.100
RATHER THAN
PUSH THEM
OUT OF OUR LIVES

16:51.100 --> 16:53.667
AND MAKE THEM HATE
OUR GUTS, YOU KNOW?

16:53.667 --> 16:56.367
THAT IS SO
ROMANTIC OF YOU.

16:56.367 --> 16:58.233
HA HA HA.

17:00.100 --> 17:01.300
SHE'S NOT SITTING
ON YOU, IS SHE?

17:01.300 --> 17:05.000
OH, IN HERE SHE IS,
MY FRIEND.
IN HERE SHE IS.

17:05.000 --> 17:06.300
OH.
THAT'S RIGHT.

17:06.300 --> 17:09.467
YOU KNOW, I CAN
HEAR EVERYTHING
YOU GUYS ARE SAYING.

17:10.500 --> 17:12.900
OH, YOU GUYS
ARE TERRIFIC.

17:12.900 --> 17:15.400
YOU KNOW,
BEING WITH YOU
MAKES ME REALIZE

17:15.400 --> 17:17.800
WHAT A CREEP
MY BOYFRIEND REALLY IS.

17:17.800 --> 17:18.800
YOU DESERVE BETTER.

17:18.800 --> 17:19.934
YOU DESERVE THE BEST.

17:19.934 --> 17:20.967
I'M SAYING.

17:20.967 --> 17:22.400
YOU KNOW WHAT
MY PROBLEM IS?

17:22.400 --> 17:25.367
MY PROBLEM IS
THAT I ALWAYS FEEL THAT
I NEED A MAN IN MY LIFE,

17:25.367 --> 17:28.934
AND I ALWAYS CHOOSE
THE WRONG ONE.

17:28.934 --> 17:31.500
THIS IS WHY I'M SO LUCKY
TO HAVE FOUND YOU TWO.

17:31.500 --> 17:33.033
OH.

17:35.000 --> 17:37.600
GOD, IT'S SUCH
A RELIEF KNOWING
WE CAN LIVE TOGETHER

17:37.600 --> 17:40.600
WITHOUT ALL THAT,
YOU KNOW--

17:41.700 --> 17:44.200
YEAH.

17:44.200 --> 17:45.934
THAT IS GOOD.
THAT'S A RELIEF.

17:45.934 --> 17:47.800
OOH, WOULD HAVE
BEEN HARD.

17:50.500 --> 17:54.200
WE'RE GOING TO BE
JUST LIKE GIRLFRIENDS.

17:58.133 --> 17:59.600
GIRLFRIENDS.

17:59.600 --> 18:04.133
THERE'S A--WAIT.
IF I UNDERSTAND
THIS CORRECTLY,

18:04.133 --> 18:06.734
GIRLFRIENDS
SLEEP TOGETHER,
BATHE TOGETHER,

18:06.734 --> 18:08.600
AND EVEN GET TO SEE
EACH OTHER NAKED.

18:10.300 --> 18:12.867
WE ALREADY DO THAT.

18:14.600 --> 18:16.500
SHH.

18:20.667 --> 18:21.667
OH, IT'S ALL MY FAULT.

18:21.667 --> 18:23.667
I CAME DOWN WAY
TOO HARD ON THEM.

18:23.667 --> 18:25.300
I--I MADE THEM DO IT.

18:25.300 --> 18:26.700
I'M THE ONE THAT
JUMPED ALL OVER THEM.

18:26.700 --> 18:28.567
CORY STOOD UP TO ME
LIKE A MAN,

18:28.567 --> 18:29.900
AND I JUST
SHOT HIM DOWN.

18:29.900 --> 18:31.834
NO, NO. CORY CAME TO ME
FOR ADVICE.

18:31.834 --> 18:32.834
HE WANTED ME
TO TELL HIM TO WAIT.

18:32.834 --> 18:36.300
I TOLD HIM TO GO AHEAD
AND GET MARRIED.

18:36.300 --> 18:37.600
WELL, HEY,
DON'T LOOK AT ME.

18:37.600 --> 18:39.100
I SAID ALL
THE RIGHT THINGS.

18:39.100 --> 18:40.800
BUT IT DIDN'T MATTER.

18:40.800 --> 18:43.400
YOU CAN'T TELL
CORY AND TOPANGA
WHAT TO DO.

18:43.400 --> 18:46.734
I'VE BEEN TRYING
TO DO THAT SINCE
THE FIRST GRADE.

18:46.734 --> 18:49.133
I REMEMBER WHEN
I TRIED TO SEPARATE
THEIR DESKS.

18:49.133 --> 18:53.400
SHE KICKED ME,
HE BIT ME,

18:53.400 --> 18:55.667
AND SOME LITTLE PUNK
KEPT SAYING,

18:55.667 --> 18:57.834
"LEAVE THEM ALONE.
THEY SHOULD
GET MARRIED."

19:00.066 --> 19:02.600
I WAS CUTE THEN, HUH?

19:02.600 --> 19:05.200
PRECIOUS.

19:05.200 --> 19:08.467
BUT THE POINT IS,
YOUR ADVICE CAME
FROM A GOOD PLACE,

19:08.467 --> 19:09.467
BUT CORY AND TOPANGA

19:09.467 --> 19:11.600
AREN'T IN THE
FIRST GRADE ANYMORE.

19:11.600 --> 19:13.100
THEY MADE
THEIR OWN DECISION,

19:13.100 --> 19:14.467
AND I THINK
THEY'LL BE FINE

19:14.467 --> 19:16.800
BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN
WELL BROUGHT UP.

19:16.800 --> 19:18.734
AND WELL TAUGHT.

19:18.734 --> 19:22.033
WELL, I'VE DONE
THE BEST I CAN.

19:22.033 --> 19:24.133
ALAN...

19:24.133 --> 19:25.734
WHAT'S WRONG?

19:28.000 --> 19:31.400
I WISH WE COULD
BE AT THE WEDDING.

19:36.934 --> 19:41.133
[PLAYING<i>THE WEDDING MARCH]</i>

19:57.934 --> 19:59.500
WE ARE GATHERED
HERE TODAY

19:59.500 --> 20:01.500
TO JOIN
IN HOLY MATRIMONY

20:01.500 --> 20:04.200
CORY AND TOPANGA.

20:05.233 --> 20:08.300
BUT THEY'RE
SO YOUNG, HENRY.

20:08.300 --> 20:11.834
WHY DON'T WE JUST
GIVE THEM BACK
THEIR MONEY?

20:11.834 --> 20:14.033
THAT WOULD BE
A NICE GESTURE.

20:14.033 --> 20:16.667
36 YEARS, AND SHE
STILL DON'T GET IT.

20:18.033 --> 20:20.734
THIS IS WHAT WE DO
FOR A LIVING.

20:20.734 --> 20:21.934
WHERE WAS I?

20:23.367 --> 20:24.467
CUT TO THE CHASE.

20:24.467 --> 20:27.934
DO YOU, CORY,
TAKE TOPANGA
TO BE YOUR WIFE,

20:27.934 --> 20:29.800
TO HONOR
AND CHERISH HER,

20:29.800 --> 20:31.400
FOR RICHER,
FOR POORER,

20:31.400 --> 20:33.500
IN SICKNESS
AND IN HEALTH,

20:33.500 --> 20:36.100
TILL DEATH
DO YOU PART?

20:37.133 --> 20:39.600
WELL, I ALWAYS HAVE.

20:41.200 --> 20:43.300
I ALWAYS WILL.

20:44.367 --> 20:46.467
I DO.

20:46.467 --> 20:49.867
AND DO YOU, TOPANGA,
TAKE CORY TO BE
YOUR HUSBAND,

20:49.867 --> 20:51.400
TO HONOR
AND CHERISH HIM,

20:51.400 --> 20:52.867
FOR RICHER,
FOR POORER,

20:52.867 --> 20:55.000
IN SICKNESS
AND IN HEALTH,

20:55.000 --> 20:57.934
TILL DEATH
DO YOU PART?
