WEBVTT

00:20.800 --> 00:22.600
SO TOMORROW'S
THE BIG DAY, HUH?

00:22.600 --> 00:26.767
YUP. TOMORROW MORNING
CORY MATTHEWS TURNS 16
AND MOBILE.

00:26.767 --> 00:29.500
AND I HAVE WORKED OUT
ALL THE DETAILS FOR OUR
BIG BIRTHDAY ROAD TRIP.

00:29.500 --> 00:32.200
YOU CAN GET
YOUR FATHER'S CAR
TOMORROW NIGHT, RIGHT?

00:32.200 --> 00:33.834
WELL, NATURALLY.
I'M 16, IT'S MY RIGHT.

00:33.834 --> 00:35.700
HE'S PROBABLY
FILLING UP THE TANK
FOR ME RIGHT NOW.

00:35.700 --> 00:37.667
THIS IS A LIFE LANDMARK.

00:37.667 --> 00:39.233
THIS IS THE FIRST
CORY DRIVES ROAD TRIP.

00:39.233 --> 00:43.600
THE POINT IS, WE ARE
MERELY GUESTS OF THE CAR,
THE WIND, AND DESTINY.

00:43.600 --> 00:47.934
NO, NO. THE POINT IS,
A LICENSE SAYS WE ARE
ADULTS WITH CARS

00:47.934 --> 00:49.200
WHO CAN SEE
"R" RATED MOVIES.

00:49.200 --> 00:51.400
I'M NOT GOING WITH YOU GUYS
TO SOME "R" RATED MOVIE.

00:51.400 --> 00:53.033
UH, VAN DAMME
TAKES HIS SHIRT OFF.

00:53.033 --> 00:54.300
A-OO-GA!

00:55.734 --> 00:57.367
AND THAT IS ONLY
THE BEGINNING.

00:57.367 --> 01:00.200
THE BEST PART IS,
WE ARE SEEING IT
IN ATLANTIC CITY.

01:00.200 --> 01:02.400
WHY WOULD WE GO
TO ATLANTIC CITY WHEN WE
CAN SEE IT RIGHT HERE?

01:02.400 --> 01:03.500
BECAUSE WE CAN!

01:03.500 --> 01:04.934
BECAUSE WE CAN
GO ANYWHERE.

01:04.934 --> 01:06.700
BECAUSE TOMORROW
I GOT WHEELS.

01:06.700 --> 01:08.100
I AM FREE
AND INDEPENDENT.

01:08.100 --> 01:09.900
TOMORROW I AM A MAN!

01:09.900 --> 01:11.500
WHO GETS A CLOWN BURGER?

01:14.300 --> 01:16.200
I COLLECT
THE LITTLE HATS.

01:20.500 --> 01:21.900
ALAN, WHY AREN'T YOU
AT THE STORE?

01:21.900 --> 01:23.233
OH, I HAD ERIC
OPEN THE STORE.

01:23.233 --> 01:24.700
I GOT BIG PLANS TODAY.

01:24.700 --> 01:26.000
OH, YEAH?

01:26.000 --> 01:27.100
YEAH. IT'S CORY DAY.

01:27.100 --> 01:28.367
I'M GONNA TAKE HIM
DOWN TO THE D.M.V.,

01:28.367 --> 01:29.834
WATCH HIM TAKE
HIS DRIVER'S TEST,

01:29.834 --> 01:31.000
AND OFF
TO WOODY'S ROADHOUSE

01:31.000 --> 01:32.967
FOR A LETHAL DOSE
OF HOME FRIES,
STEAK, AND EGGS.

01:32.967 --> 01:34.500
JUST LIKE YOU DID
WITH ERIC.

01:34.500 --> 01:36.133
MM-HMM. MY DAD
DID IT WITH ME.

01:36.133 --> 01:38.400
A MATTHEWS MEN'S
LICENSE DAY TRADITION.

01:38.400 --> 01:40.100
I WASHED THE CAR
SO IT'LL LOOK GOOD

01:40.100 --> 01:41.033
IN THE PICTURE
I'M GONNA TAKE

01:41.033 --> 01:42.200
AFTER
HE PASSES HIS TEST.

01:42.200 --> 01:44.400
DOES, UH, CORY KNOW
ABOUT THESE PLANS, HONEY?

01:44.400 --> 01:46.033
MM-MMM. MATTHEWS MEN
TRADITION.

01:46.033 --> 01:48.600
YOU DON'T
HAVE TO TELL 'EM.
IT'S IN THE GENES.

01:48.600 --> 01:49.600
[HORN HONKS]

01:49.600 --> 01:51.467
CORY'S DRIVING A CAR.

01:51.467 --> 01:53.467
WITHOUT A LICENSE?

01:55.867 --> 01:58.100
HEY. I PASSED
MY DRIVER'S TEST.

01:58.100 --> 01:59.200
I GOT MY LICENSE.

01:59.200 --> 02:01.400
WELL, MY--MY TEMP
LICENSE ANYWAY. SEE?

02:01.400 --> 02:03.000
HONEY, THAT'S GREAT.

02:03.000 --> 02:04.467
ALAN,
ISN'T THAT GREAT?

02:04.467 --> 02:06.800
YEAH, THAT--THAT--
THAT'S GREAT, COR.

02:06.800 --> 02:08.100
UH, HAPPY BIRTHDAY.

02:08.100 --> 02:10.967
YEAH, THAT--
THAT'S REALLY GREAT.

02:13.600 --> 02:16.100
UH, MOM, IS IT JUST ME,

02:16.100 --> 02:18.300
OR WERE THEY HAPPIER FOR ME
DOWN AT THE D.M.V.?

02:18.300 --> 02:20.934
OH, ACTUALLY, CORY,
YOUR DAD'S A LITTLE
LET DOWN.

02:20.934 --> 02:23.500
HE KIND OF THOUGHT
YOU MIGHT WANT
TO DO THIS WITH HIM.

02:23.500 --> 02:25.100
HE DID?
YEAH.

02:25.100 --> 02:27.500
YEAH, BUT HE NEVER
SAID ANYTHING. WE DIDN'T
HAVE ANYTHING PLANNED.

02:27.500 --> 02:29.300
BOY, I WENT
WITH MY DAD.

02:33.600 --> 02:35.800
DAD.

02:35.800 --> 02:39.300
HEY, UH, LISTEN,
SORRY ABOUT
THIS WHOLE THING.

02:39.300 --> 02:42.133
UH, I DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS
SUCH A BIG DEAL TO YOU.

02:42.133 --> 02:45.400
'CAUSE, YOU KNOW,
TOPANGA GOT HER LICENSE
AND SHAWN GOT HIS,

02:45.400 --> 02:47.500
AND THEY WANTED TO BE
WITH ME WHEN I GOT MINE.

02:47.500 --> 02:49.400
I DIDN'T WANT
TO DISAPPOINT 'EM.

02:49.400 --> 02:50.900
YEAH, I GOT IT.

02:50.900 --> 02:54.834
OK. SO, UH,
WE'RE COOL?

02:54.834 --> 02:56.500
YEAH, WE'RE COOL.

02:56.500 --> 03:01.100
COOL ENOUGH FOR YOU
TO GIVE ME THE KEYS?

03:03.367 --> 03:04.400
WHY NOT?

03:04.400 --> 03:05.867
GOT A COUPLE
OF ERRANDS TO RUN.

03:05.867 --> 03:09.834
I WOULDN'T MIND BEING
CHAUFFEURED AROUND
FOR A CHANGE, HUH?

03:09.834 --> 03:12.500
SO, ROAD TRIP.
YOU GOT THE KEYS YET?

03:12.500 --> 03:16.834
OH, UH, YOU MEANT
YOUR FRIENDS. OK.

03:16.834 --> 03:19.600
WELL, NO, NO.
YOU COULD COME, TOO.

03:19.600 --> 03:21.400
WHAT?!

03:21.400 --> 03:22.967
KIND OF ROAD TRIP
WOULD IT BE

03:22.967 --> 03:25.900
WITHOUT GOOD OLD
MR. MATTHEWS?

03:25.900 --> 03:28.300
WAS WHAT
I WAS GONNA SAY.

03:28.300 --> 03:30.500
AND NOW I'M DONE.

03:30.500 --> 03:33.367
HEY, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.

03:33.367 --> 03:35.300
I DO HAVE A COUPLE
ERRANDS TO RUN.

03:35.300 --> 03:37.734
IT'LL TAKE ME
A COUPLE HOURS, BUT
THEN WHEN I COME BACK,

03:37.734 --> 03:39.900
THE CAR'S ALL YOURS.
ALL RIGHT, BUDDY?

03:39.900 --> 03:44.033
YEAH. IF YOU'RE ALL RIGHT,
I'M ALL RIGHT.

03:52.367 --> 03:55.200
HEY, I'VE WAITED
16 YEARS, RIGHT?

03:55.200 --> 03:56.900
I CAN WAIT
A COUPLE HOURS.

04:01.100 --> 04:03.100
I'M CORY. I'M 16,

04:03.100 --> 04:06.467
AND I'M GOING
TO ATLANTIC CITY TO
SEE AN "R" RATED MOVIE.

04:08.600 --> 04:11.200
UH, HERE, MORGAN,
LET ME HELP YOU
MAKE THE MATINEE.

04:11.200 --> 04:13.400
DADDY!

04:15.600 --> 04:18.567
WOW. LOOK AT HER GO.

04:22.367 --> 04:23.567
HI.

04:23.567 --> 04:25.834
HI. UM...

04:25.834 --> 04:27.867
LOOK, I KNOW I TOLD YOU
A COUPLE OF HOURS,

04:27.867 --> 04:30.767
BUT, UM, YOU KNOW,
ONE THING LED
TO ANOTHER, AND--

04:30.767 --> 04:32.400
YOU KNOW HOW IT IS.

04:32.400 --> 04:35.567
ACTUALLY, NO. HAVING NEVER
ACTUALLY HAD THE CAR,

04:35.567 --> 04:38.233
I--I DON'T KNOW HOW IT IS.
HOW IS IT?

04:38.233 --> 04:40.600
WELL, LOOK.

04:40.600 --> 04:43.300
HERE ARE THE KEYS.

04:43.300 --> 04:44.600
THE CAR IS YOURS.

04:44.600 --> 04:46.867
GO DO WHAT YOU
WANT TO DO.

04:49.834 --> 04:52.300
SEE, ACTUALLY, DAD,
WHAT I WANTED TO DO

04:52.300 --> 04:54.700
WAS GO ON A ROAD TRIP
WITH SHAWN AND TOPANGA,

04:54.700 --> 04:56.600
WHO WAITED HERE
FOR 5 HOURS,

04:56.600 --> 04:59.800
AND THEN THEY REALIZED
THEY HAD LIVES
AND WENT HOME.

04:59.800 --> 05:01.600
FINE. GO PICK 'EM UP.
TAKE 'EM FOR A DRIVE.

05:01.600 --> 05:04.300
FINE, I WILL.

05:04.300 --> 05:07.600
JUST MAKE SURE
YOU'RE BACK IN TIME
FOR YOUR BIRTHDAY DINNER.

05:07.600 --> 05:09.300
WELL, WAIT A MINUTE.
YOU NEVER--

05:09.300 --> 05:12.200
NO, THERE WAS
NOTHING EVER MENTIONED
ABOUT A BIRTHDAY DINNER.

05:12.200 --> 05:14.100
CORY, WHY WOULD ANYONE
HAVE TO MENTION IT?

05:14.100 --> 05:17.500
WE'VE HAD DINNER
ON YOUR BIRTHDAY EVERY YEAR
SINCE YOU'VE BEEN ALIVE.

05:17.500 --> 05:19.867
BUT I'VE
NEVER BEEN ALIVE
WITH A LICENSE, DAD,

05:19.867 --> 05:21.934
SO THIS YEAR, ROAD TRIP.

05:21.934 --> 05:26.200
SO WE'LL SEE YOU
AT CHUBBIE'S IN 45 MINUTES.

05:26.200 --> 05:28.500
45--DAD, THAT'S BARELY
EVEN WORTH IT.

05:28.500 --> 05:29.934
FINE. GIVE ME THE KEYS.

05:31.000 --> 05:32.400
FINE. TAKE 'EM.

05:37.834 --> 05:41.133
AW, WHAT'S THE MATTER,
BIRTHDAY BROTHER?

05:41.133 --> 05:44.834
SOMETHING GOT YOU
TERRIBLY, TERRIBLY SAD?

05:44.834 --> 05:47.133
ERIC, WHEN YOU WERE 16--

05:47.133 --> 05:49.567
YEAH, I HAD THE SAME
GREAT HAIR.

05:49.567 --> 05:53.467
LISTEN, DID DAD
STILL TREAT YOU
LIKE YOU WERE 6?

05:53.467 --> 05:57.800
NO. HE WEIRDED OUT
A LITTLE BIT ON ME
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,

05:57.800 --> 05:59.200
I GOT MY LICENSE
AND MADE HIM FEEL OLD,

05:59.200 --> 06:01.133
AND HE WENT OUT
AND BOUGHT A CEMETERY
PLOT AND EVERYTHING,

06:01.133 --> 06:04.500
BUT I BET YOU
IT'S NOT NEARLY AS BAD
AS HE'S TREATING YOU.

06:04.500 --> 06:05.800
'CAUSE HE LIKES
YOU BETTER.

06:05.800 --> 06:07.600
YUP, HE DOES,
HE DOES.

06:07.600 --> 06:09.500
WELL, THAT,
AND HE STILL
HAD YOU AROUND.

06:09.500 --> 06:11.000
WELL, HE'S GOT MORGAN.

06:11.000 --> 06:12.467
GIRL.
WHAT?

06:12.467 --> 06:14.300
YOU'RE
HIS LAST SON, SON.

06:14.300 --> 06:15.900
NOW YOU'RE OLD
ENOUGH TO DRIVE AWAY

06:15.900 --> 06:18.233
AND LEAVE HIM ALONE
WITH MORGAN,
WHO GOES TO...

06:18.233 --> 06:19.500
ART CLASS.

06:19.500 --> 06:21.200
AND...

06:24.100 --> 06:25.767
BALLET.

06:25.767 --> 06:27.133
YEAH. SEE,
THE ONLY REASON

06:27.133 --> 06:29.000
YOU'RE NOT CRUISING DOWN
THAT TURNPIKE RIGHT NOW

06:29.000 --> 06:30.233
WITH YOUR ARM
AROUND TOPANGA

06:30.233 --> 06:32.133
AND SHAWN
IN THE BACK GOING,
"WHOO, WHOO, WHOO,"

06:32.133 --> 06:33.867
IS BECAUSE MORGAN'S
HIS FIRST DAUGHTER

06:33.867 --> 06:35.867
AND NOT
HIS THIRD SON, SON.

06:40.734 --> 06:42.600
WHAT?

06:42.600 --> 06:44.500
DOWN, SET, HIKE.

06:44.500 --> 06:45.900
BUTTONHOOK.

06:46.967 --> 06:49.133
OW! WHY'D YOU DO THAT?

06:49.133 --> 06:51.400
BECAUSE I CALLED
A BUTTONHOOK,
YOU WOMAN.

06:51.400 --> 06:52.600
I DIDN'T SAY
STOP AND GO.

06:52.600 --> 06:53.700
I DIDN'T SAY
DOWN AND OUT.

06:53.700 --> 06:54.667
I DIDN'T SAY POST.

06:54.667 --> 06:56.300
I SAID BUTTONHOOK.

06:56.300 --> 06:57.500
NOW WAS THE BALL NOT
THERE WAITING FOR YOU?

06:57.500 --> 06:58.800
IF YOU DON'T STOP YELLING,

06:58.800 --> 07:01.000
I'M GOING UPSTAIRS TO PLAY
WITH BARBIE AND SKIPPER.

07:01.000 --> 07:02.767
NO, NO. DON'T DO THAT.

07:02.767 --> 07:04.367
HERE, PUT THESE ON.

07:04.367 --> 07:06.834
I DON'T WANT TO WEAR
BOXING MITTENS.

07:06.834 --> 07:08.000
I DON'T KNOW
HOW THEY WORK.

07:08.000 --> 07:09.734
MORGAN, THEY'RE NOT
BOXING MITTENS, OK?

07:09.734 --> 07:12.100
THEY'RE BOXING GLOVES,
AND THEY DON'T WORK.
YOU JUST HIT ME.

07:12.100 --> 07:13.400
AAH!

07:15.200 --> 07:16.867
NOW WE'RE
GETTING SOMEWHERE.

07:16.867 --> 07:18.300
FINE. I'M GLAD
YOU'RE HAPPY.

07:18.300 --> 07:21.500
I HAVE TO CHANGE
INTO MY PARTY DRESS
FOR YOUR PARTY.

07:21.500 --> 07:23.000
NO DRESS. WEAR PANTS.

07:23.000 --> 07:24.367
KEEP THE HELMET ON,

07:24.367 --> 07:26.567
AND CALL A DOCTOR.

07:26.567 --> 07:29.567
I DON'T WANT YOU TO THINK
THAT I'M NOT HAVING A DANDY
TIME HERE AT CHUBBIE'S,

07:29.567 --> 07:31.400
WHERE WE ALWAYS WENT
'CAUSE WE COULD WALK HERE,

07:31.400 --> 07:34.200
BUT COULD WE JUST
DO THE CAKE THING AND
THEN HIT THE OPEN ROAD?

07:34.200 --> 07:36.200
WILL YOU STOP TELLING
CORY TO DITCH HIS OWN
BIRTHDAY PARTY?

07:36.200 --> 07:38.400
AND YOU, PUT
A SMILE ON YOUR FACE
AND BEHAVE YOURSELF.

07:38.400 --> 07:42.667
GUYS, WE RENTED THE ROOM.
WE DON'T HAVE TO WHISPER.

07:42.667 --> 07:44.000
SORRY, DAD.

07:44.000 --> 07:47.667
UM, LISTEN,
THANK YOU--THANK YOU
GUYS FOR THE PARTY.

07:47.667 --> 07:49.300
IT'S--IT'S REALLY
NICE, BUT, UH,

07:49.300 --> 07:51.567
THERE'S
THIS MOVIE WE'RE
TRYING TO MAKE.

07:51.567 --> 07:52.867
WHAT MOVIE?

07:52.867 --> 07:54.100
<i>101 DALMATIANS.</i>

07:54.100 --> 07:56.400
WOULD YOU
FINALLY GROW UP?

07:56.400 --> 07:58.900
WE'RE GOING TO SEE
THE NEW VAN DAMME MOVIE.

07:58.900 --> 08:02.500
AHA, WELL, WOULDN'T THAT
BE AN "R" RATED MOVIE?

08:02.500 --> 08:04.200
DAD, COME ON,
I'M 16.

08:04.200 --> 08:06.000
I'M NOT A LITTLE
KID ANYMORE.

08:06.000 --> 08:07.800
HERE'S YOUR
CLOWN BURGER.

08:07.800 --> 08:10.200
I TOLD THEM IT WAS
YOUR BIRTHDAY, SO THEY
THREW IN AN EXTRA HAT.

08:10.200 --> 08:11.600
WHOO-HOO!

08:11.600 --> 08:14.367
I MEAN, WHOO-HOO.

08:14.367 --> 08:17.100
CORY, I UNDERSTAND
YOU'RE 16,

08:17.100 --> 08:20.500
AND YET YOU HAVE TO BE 17
TO GET IN WITHOUT AN ADULT.

08:20.500 --> 08:22.367
FINE, NO MOVIE.

08:22.367 --> 08:23.500
THANK YOU.

08:23.500 --> 08:24.867
NO BIGGIE, NO BIGGIE.

08:24.867 --> 08:26.200
THERE'S GOT TO BE TONS
OF OTHER STUFF

08:26.200 --> 08:27.500
WE CAN DO
IN ATLANTIC CITY.

08:27.500 --> 08:29.233
LET'S HIT
THOSE TABLES, HUH?

08:29.233 --> 08:32.100
YOU REALLY DON'T
WANT TO DO ANYTHING
AT ALL, DO YOU?

08:32.100 --> 08:34.967
YOU WANT TO SNEAK
INTO AN "R" RATED FILM
IN ANOTHER STATE?

08:34.967 --> 08:37.367
I'M NOT JUST GONNA
GIVE YOU MY BLESSING.

08:37.367 --> 08:38.700
ALAN, IT'S
HIS BIRTHDAY.

08:38.700 --> 08:39.967
WHOA, WHOA,
WAIT A MINUTE.

08:39.967 --> 08:41.734
DAD, I WASN'T
ASKING YOU FOR
YOUR BLESSING HERE.

08:41.734 --> 08:43.800
I JUST WANTED
TO GO SOMEWHERE
WITH MY FRIENDS.

08:43.800 --> 08:45.400
CORY, THIS IS
YOUR FATHER.

08:45.400 --> 08:48.400
YOU THINK BECAUSE YOU
GOT A LICENSE, YOU CAN
DO WHATEVER YOU WANT.

08:48.400 --> 08:50.600
NO. I JUST WANT
TO GO SOMEWHERE
WITH MY FRIENDS.

08:50.600 --> 08:53.300
I DON'T CARE
WHERE I GO.
I JUST WANT TO GO.

08:57.400 --> 08:59.567
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.

08:59.567 --> 09:01.400
YOU WANT TO TAKE
A ROAD TRIP?

09:01.400 --> 09:03.300
YOU WANT TO GO OFF
WITH YOUR FRIENDS?

09:03.300 --> 09:07.400
THAT'S THE FIRST ADULT
DECISION YOU'RE GONNA MAKE?

09:07.400 --> 09:08.500
YEAH.

09:10.767 --> 09:11.734
FINE.

TO ACCEPT THAT I'M NOT

GOT MY FRIENDS,

OF NOWHERE.

ANYTHING TO HIM

18:20.100 --> 18:21.400

19:27.834 --> 19:29.467
YOU WILL ALWAYS
BE MY SON,

19:29.467 --> 19:31.100
WHETHER YOU'RE 6
OR YOU'RE 60,

19:31.100 --> 19:33.033
AND YOUR PROBLEM
IS MY PROBLEM.

19:33.033 --> 19:34.700
NOW, I'M ALWAYS GONNA
BE THERE FOR YOU.

19:34.700 --> 19:36.033
NOW, THAT IS NEVER
GONNA CHANGE.

19:36.033 --> 19:37.400
I JUST WANT YOU TO TREAT ME

19:37.400 --> 19:39.233
AS SOMEONE WHO CAN HANDLE
HIS OWN PROBLEMS, DAD.

19:39.233 --> 19:41.567
I WANT YOU TO TREAT ME
LIKE AN ADULT.

19:41.567 --> 19:43.900
ALL RIGHT,
I'VE HEARD ENOUGH.

19:43.900 --> 19:46.233
THIS COURT IS READY
TO PRONOUNCE SENTENCE.

19:46.233 --> 19:48.467
CORY MATTHEWS
AND CORY MATTHEWS'
FATHER,

19:48.467 --> 19:50.100
APPROACH THE BENCH.

19:52.200 --> 19:53.300
AHEM.

19:56.000 --> 20:01.767
I HEREBY SENTENCE YOU
TO, UH, 2 YEARS.

20:01.767 --> 20:02.900
WHAT?

20:02.900 --> 20:06.033
TODAY IS YOUR
16th BIRTHDAY, SON.

20:06.033 --> 20:09.400
THAT MEANS YOU HAVE
2 YEARS MORE OF BEING A KID.

20:09.400 --> 20:13.200
NOW I KNOW THAT SEEMS LIKE
HARD LABOR WHEN YOU HAVE
A LICENSE IN YOUR HAND,

20:13.200 --> 20:17.200
BUT FROM WHAT I CAN SURMISE
OF YOUR HOME LIFE,

20:17.200 --> 20:21.367
YOU'RE LUCKIER, CORY,
THAT MOST WHO APPEAR
BEFORE ME,

20:22.800 --> 20:24.567
AND YOU, DAD,

20:24.567 --> 20:30.467
I SENTENCE YOU
TO TAKE THOSE 2 YEARS
AND CHERISH THEM...

20:31.934 --> 20:35.033
BECAUSE THEY GO BY
TOO FAST.

20:35.033 --> 20:36.834
YES, THEY DO,
DON'T THEY?

20:36.834 --> 20:40.467
MMM. IT'S A SPEED TRAP.

20:52.700 --> 20:55.600
<i>Alan: YOU SET? GO.</i>
<i>NO, NO, NO. WHOA, WHOA!</i>

20:55.600 --> 20:57.967
<i>GO FORWARD. FORWARD.</i>
<i>PUSH IT FORWARD.</i>

20:57.967 --> 21:01.000
<i>THAT'S IT. OK. GO ON.</i>
<i>HEY, THERE YOU GO.</i>

21:01.000 --> 21:03.400
<i>OH, YOU SHOULD</i>
<i>GET YOUR LICENSE.</i>

21:03.400 --> 21:04.734
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, SON.

21:04.734 --> 21:07.600
THANKS, DAD. SO, UH,
WHEN DO YOU THINK

21:07.600 --> 21:09.400
THERE'S
GONNA BE TENSION
BETWEEN US AGAIN?

21:09.400 --> 21:11.600
WELL, WE JUST GOT THROUGH
THE DRIVER'S LICENSE THING,

21:11.600 --> 21:15.800
SO PROBABLY THE NEXT TIME
WE FIGHT, IT'LL BE OVER
YOUR CHOICE OF COLLEGE.

21:15.800 --> 21:17.133
DAD, I'M NOT GOING
TO COLLEGE.

21:17.133 --> 21:18.800
WELL, THEN IT'LL BE OVER
THE JOB YOU WANT TO GET.

21:18.800 --> 21:20.000
CIRCUS CLOWN.

21:20.000 --> 21:21.400
WELL, I GUESS
WE'LL HAVE TO FIGHT

21:21.400 --> 21:22.600
OVER THE WOMAN
YOU'RE GONNA MARRY.

21:22.600 --> 21:25.500
DAD, TOPANGA AND I
HAVE ALREADY RUN OFF
TO VEGAS.

21:26.367 --> 21:27.467
AMY!

21:27.467 --> 21:30.734
Amy: NO MORE KIDS!

21:30.734 --> 21:31.800
WELL, I GUESS I'M STUCK.

21:31.800 --> 21:33.000
I GUESS YOU ARE.

21:33.000 --> 21:34.900
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA
DO ABOUT IT, PUNK?

21:34.900 --> 21:36.467
YOU WANNA--
YOU WANNA MAKE
SOMETHING OF IT?

21:36.467 --> 21:37.800
COME ON,
COME ON, COME ON.

21:37.800 --> 21:39.233
COME ON, YEAH!
