all about the fish living in

What they should do
is introduce a nice game fish
like the muskie.

01:32:56.839 --> 01:32:58.874
Now, that's a fine species.
Hmm.

01:32:58.907 --> 01:33:01.677
No fish from Minnesota
should be allowed to
swim past the Missouri.

01:33:03.345 --> 01:33:05.080
If the fine citizens
of Northfork knew

01:33:05.113 --> 01:33:06.181
that muskie was swimming
through their houses,

01:33:07.816 --> 01:33:09.885
we would've never been able to
get 'em to leave.

01:33:09.918 --> 01:33:12.788

within myself to find.

I am complete.

I am not king nor queen,
yet I am both.

A mother and a father.

You prayed to be this way?

you see many things.

But all issues I had passed.

01:38:16.558 --> 01:38:18.927
Because I was to be a witness.

A helper.

01:38:23.365 --> 01:38:25.133
And that's the thing, I think,

is important about death,

01:38:29.471 --> 01:38:31.306
is the ability for us

But maybe there's
a birth someplace else.

Maybe there's a blessing

take your last walk
down the dirt road

01:42:35.750 --> 01:42:37.919
that leads to where
your house may have been,

that you once climbed.

those trees for what
