And she'll be here momentarily.

01:35.553 --> 01:37.430
Wait, do I know her?

01:37.514 --> 01:39.015
I'll give you one hint.

01:39.099 --> 01:40.308
It's Jessica.

01:40.642 --> 01:44.229
Bud's girlfriend from college?
Does he know that you still see her?

01:44.312 --> 01:47.065
Of course he does.
I just haven't told him.

01:48.066 --> 01:51.319
-Well, isn't that a little weird?
-Why? Bud still sees my ex.

01:52.028 --> 01:52.862
[knocking]

01:54.322 --> 01:55.824
Hey! [chuckles]

01:55.907 --> 01:57.283
Oh, look at you!

01:57.367 --> 01:59.994
Oh, I am so excited to see this.

02:00.078 --> 02:01.246
Hey, I'm Jessica.

Uh, I'm Coyote.

Oh, my God. I'm sorry.

02:06.751 --> 02:09.337
[slight chuckle]
The last time I saw you, you had long hair

02:09.420 --> 02:12.090
and had just woken up
in a Long John Silver's

02:12.173 --> 02:13.508
with cake in your pocket.

02:13.591 --> 02:16.302
That was the same day I got fired
from Long John Silver's.

02:16.386 --> 02:18.346
He's come a long way since then.

02:18.680 --> 02:20.557
-I can see.
-Thanks.

02:20.640 --> 02:23.101
I'll be sober ten years in six years.

02:23.184 --> 02:25.562
I'm impressed, minus four.

02:26.855 --> 02:29.315
Well, how impressed are we with me?

02:30.066 --> 02:32.318
Oh, whoa!

02:32.694 --> 02:33.987
Uh, that's...

02:34.070 --> 02:35.280
Well, what's wrong?

02:35.363 --> 02:37.157
Oh, no, nothing. It's amazing.

02:37.240 --> 02:39.242
It's just, um... [slight chuckle]

02:39.325 --> 02:42.495
...you had me pose like Wonder Woman
for eight hours.

02:42.579 --> 02:46.708
I was going for empowering,
but turns out, I can't do elbows.

02:46.791 --> 02:50.128
Uh, it's a shame, though,
'cause I'm cracker jack at knockers.

02:50.211 --> 02:52.881
Okay, can I just say... I love it.

02:52.964 --> 02:53.965
Oh.

02:54.048 --> 02:57.677
It is, uh... way bigger
than I remember, though.

02:57.760 --> 02:59.929
Well, I-I can help you out with it.

03:00.013 --> 03:00.847
-Thanks.
-Mm-hmm.

03:00.930 --> 03:02.599
I just, um, hope it fits in my car.

03:02.682 --> 03:03.975
Oh, don't worry.

03:04.058 --> 03:07.770
Coyote's a master
at fitting big things into small places.

03:11.524 --> 03:13.026
We all heard it, right?

03:13.818 --> 03:14.903
We all heard that?

03:15.987 --> 03:16.988
Yep.

03:18.656 --> 03:21.951
[Dr. Rogers] The results weren't exactly
what we hoped for.

03:26.497 --> 03:27.582
[Sol] Oh, my God.

03:28.791 --> 03:33.046
Is it just in... one... or both of them?

03:33.713 --> 03:35.048
Well, you've only got one.

03:36.466 --> 03:38.635
I'm going to say "no" to that.

03:38.718 --> 03:39.719
Oops.

03:40.094 --> 03:41.471
Wrong pamphlet.

03:46.142 --> 03:47.185
[both] Oh.

03:47.268 --> 03:49.771
[Dr. Rogers] Now, we've caught it early,
it's indolent,

03:49.854 --> 03:52.232
so it's slow-growing, which is terrific.

03:52.315 --> 03:54.734
-It's terrific?
-But it's cancer.

03:54.984 --> 03:56.444
Sol has cancer.

03:56.527 --> 03:58.655
Or if you gave us the wrong pamphlet,

03:58.738 --> 04:00.657
maybe you gave us
the wrong blood work, too.

04:00.740 --> 04:04.118
-Are you sure this wasn't Robert's?
-Sol.

04:04.494 --> 04:05.787
Not that I want that.

04:06.079 --> 04:10.166
I just think I'd do better
dealing with this if you had it.

04:10.250 --> 04:13.836
Sol, I want you to think of your prostate

04:13.920 --> 04:16.422
like this walnut.

04:16.506 --> 04:19.717
You've got a funky walnut. That's all.

04:19.801 --> 04:21.636
It's fairly common at your age.

04:23.888 --> 04:26.683
So, what's the game plan?
What do we do now?

04:26.766 --> 04:31.437
Well, there's surgery, but that
can be risky any time you go under.

04:31.521 --> 04:34.816
Then afterwards, with infections,
yada yada.

04:34.899 --> 04:36.734
Loss of sexual function.

04:37.443 --> 04:40.154
There's radiation, that whole megillah.

04:40.238 --> 04:43.199
Or we keep a good check on it,

04:43.283 --> 04:46.327
and you do whatever you want
with no change at all.

04:46.786 --> 04:47.912
Do nothing?

04:47.996 --> 04:50.039
Well, so he can keep doing everything.

04:51.374 --> 04:53.751
The good news is, at your age,

04:53.835 --> 04:56.170
something else
will probably kill you first.

04:56.546 --> 04:58.631
Do you understand the term "good news"?

04:58.715 --> 05:03.386
Hold on. So you would tell someone
who's 50 to have the surgery, yes?

05:03.469 --> 05:04.554
Absolutely.

05:04.637 --> 05:06.347
-And 60?
-Same.

05:06.431 --> 05:08.808
Sol, you're 75.

05:08.891 --> 05:10.935
You're about my age, what would you do?

05:11.019 --> 05:15.398
Look, I smoke two packs a day.
I'm surprised I made it to work today.

05:15.481 --> 05:17.442
And I'm not feeling so great.

05:17.817 --> 05:19.527
Maybe I'll go home early.

05:20.028 --> 05:21.821
So I'd let it ride.

05:21.904 --> 05:25.908
But you're a healthy guy,
and it's your walnut.

05:32.665 --> 05:33.541
Knock-knock.

05:34.334 --> 05:35.668
Well, that feels weird.

05:35.752 --> 05:38.963
Well, don't you look
like a piece of hot biscuit?

05:39.630 --> 05:40.715
Well, thanks.

05:40.798 --> 05:44.135
I've just joined a new Pilates class,
so, uh, I only have a few minutes.

05:44.218 --> 05:45.636
That's all I need.

05:45.720 --> 05:48.639
So, what is this revolutionary thing
you need me to see?

05:48.723 --> 05:50.391
I've been thinking about your problem,

05:50.475 --> 05:53.561
the one where I was the Han Solo
to your Princess Stuck-on-the-Can?

05:53.644 --> 05:55.396
Oh, quit calling me that!

05:55.480 --> 05:57.148
Calm down, Princess Stuck-on-the-Can.

05:57.231 --> 06:02.236
No one will ever call you that again,
and let me show you why.

06:05.365 --> 06:06.240
[slight chuckle]

06:06.324 --> 06:09.786
Grace, they have toilets today
that do everything.

06:10.119 --> 06:14.123
They light up, they have quiet-close lids,
built-in bidets.

06:14.207 --> 06:17.335
But it's everything except
what could really help you.

06:17.794 --> 06:19.629
I am really all good.

06:19.712 --> 06:22.382
I've even come up
with a name you will love.

06:22.882 --> 06:24.133
The Bottoms Up.

06:24.217 --> 06:26.302
-Hate it.
-Happy you asked.

06:26.386 --> 06:29.305

for it to gently lift you

06:29.389 --> 06:32.058

we just need a seat belt.

06:39.524 --> 06:42.318
Before you say anything, goodbye.

06:42.402 --> 06:45.613
Look, so there's a few kinks to work out.

06:45.696 --> 06:48.241
That's why I need you. For kinks.

06:48.324 --> 06:51.452
Well, you might try hydraulics
as opposed to springs.

06:51.536 --> 06:56.499
Hydraulics, that's good.
Maybe I talk to my mechanic, LuAnne.

06:56.582 --> 06:58.209
You're not serious about this.

06:58.292 --> 07:00.461
Oh, this is a good idea, right?

07:00.545 --> 07:03.131
For what, to get over a medieval wall?

07:03.214 --> 07:05.550
No, as a new business for us.

07:05.633 --> 07:07.510
Let's get the band back together.

07:07.593 --> 07:09.429
Oh, also, we should start a band.

07:09.512 --> 07:12.849
Frankie, this is the last thing
I want to even think about.

07:12.932 --> 07:15.143
-A band?
-No! All of this.

07:15.226 --> 07:18.980
But all of this is to help people like you
get off the can

07:19.063 --> 07:22.066
without having to lasso
some stupid sculpture.

07:22.150 --> 07:23.234
Well, I'm helping myself.

07:23.317 --> 07:26.195
After a month of Pilates,
I'm not gonna need any sculpture.

07:26.279 --> 07:28.322
So would you just put
this toilet thing to bed?

07:28.865 --> 07:29.699
Oh.

07:29.782 --> 07:32.368
If you say the words "toilet bed,"
I am out of here.

07:32.910 --> 07:34.328
I was gonna say...

07:35.329 --> 07:36.372
"napper crapper."

07:36.914 --> 07:38.958
Bye... forever.

at Trader Joe's?

07:59.979 --> 08:02.815
When I first met her,
I remember this instant connection.

08:04.108 --> 08:07.904
I also tried to figure out
how that woman raised a Bud.

Oh, no, not in a bad way.
They're just so different.

-Yeah.
-You know, she's all, "Let it flow,"

08:15.119 --> 08:17.079
and Bud's more...

08:17.163 --> 08:19.540
Stop the flow. Plan the flow.
Worry about the flow.

08:19.624 --> 08:21.209

08:22.043 --> 08:25.379
You definitely seem
more like a Frankie kid. To me.

Well, is that why you and Bud broke up?
Too different?

08:29.509 --> 08:33.095
We were never all that serious.
It was a college thing.

You know, you're up late studying,
you're slurping ramen...

08:38.935 --> 08:42.188

to spice up particle physics.

of books and sweater vests.

-No.

-Because I can't feel it, yeah.

11:50.209 --> 11:52.878
I did think there was merit
in the original vision.

11:53.379 --> 11:55.464
Of course, Grace hated it.

11:55.548 --> 11:57.216
Oh, pishposh!

11:57.842 --> 11:59.593
Do you know what I see
in your future?

12:00.594 --> 12:04.807
Lines out the door at Bed Bath & Beyond.

12:06.267 --> 12:07.768
Grace'll come around.

12:09.270 --> 12:10.521
You're right.

12:11.439 --> 12:15.401
She was wrong about reggae,
and she's wrong about this.

12:15.484 --> 12:16.318
Yes.

12:16.402 --> 12:17.611
[both chuckle]

12:17.695 --> 12:19.071
Oh, thank you.

12:19.155 --> 12:19.989
[chuckles]

12:40.551 --> 12:44.305
Grace, we so appreciate getting
your thoughts on this new idea we have.

12:44.388 --> 12:46.766
Oh, sure, happy to do it.

12:47.391 --> 12:48.851
Shouldn't we work at the table?

12:48.934 --> 12:50.644
This sofa's so cozy.

12:51.937 --> 12:54.732
I know. [sight chuckle]
I could be on it all day.

12:55.900 --> 12:58.027
I'm so excited to hear
what you've cooked up

12:58.778 --> 13:02.072
beyond that inventive dog candy of yours.

13:02.156 --> 13:03.532
Say hello to...

13:03.616 --> 13:06.160
-[both] Streak-stensions!
-[gasps]

13:07.119 --> 13:08.662
-It's hair.
-Extensions.

13:08.746 --> 13:11.165
Streak-stensions. From real cadavers.

13:11.957 --> 13:14.376
[exhales] Nobody I know, I hope.
[chuckles]

13:14.460 --> 13:18.172
They snap-clip, real easy-breeze,
and totally kick up a look.

13:18.255 --> 13:20.549
-Oh.
-Here, Grace, try this one.

13:21.550 --> 13:23.552
Fun for a bachelorette
or when you're out clubbing.

13:23.844 --> 13:25.971
OMG, I love clubbing.

13:26.055 --> 13:28.808
-[chuckles]
-And I totally know what it is.

13:29.141 --> 13:30.267
Yass.

13:30.351 --> 13:31.644
[squeals] Check it out.

13:33.479 --> 13:35.272
-Really?
-Shake it, girl!

13:36.190 --> 13:37.316
Sh-- Um...

13:37.775 --> 13:39.777
-Well, okay.
-[Chelsea and Skye chuckle]

13:40.820 --> 13:43.322
-I sort of like the way it swings.
-[Chelsea and Skye giggling]

13:43.405 --> 13:44.323
[doorbell rings]

13:46.158 --> 13:47.159
Um...

13:48.327 --> 13:50.746
Girls, could you grab my glasses
over there on that console?

13:50.830 --> 13:51.997
-Yeah.
-Sure.

13:59.964 --> 14:01.382
They must be in the bedroom.

14:05.636 --> 14:07.680
-I know I'm early.
-By a day.

14:07.763 --> 14:10.891
But I could not wait for lunch tomorrow

14:10.975 --> 14:12.726
to fill you in on
all that's been happening

14:12.810 --> 14:14.186
with our new idea.

14:14.645 --> 14:16.355
[exhales] Grace, don't move.

14:17.022 --> 14:21.861
Some kind of animal has attached itself
to the back of your head,

14:21.944 --> 14:25.155
and it might be
the rare ring-tailed lemur.

14:25.239 --> 14:26.991
That's our Streak-stension.

14:28.409 --> 14:29.660
Oh, the girls are here?

14:30.494 --> 14:32.705
-You want to try one?
-It's cadavers.

14:33.414 --> 14:35.708
I'll take five. I have a date tonight.

14:35.791 --> 14:38.085
So, what's this idea
you're talking about, Frankie?

14:38.168 --> 14:40.462
Actually, it's something Grace and I
have been cooking up.

14:40.546 --> 14:43.549
Uh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
She cooked. I didn't cook.

14:43.632 --> 14:44.842
Well, come tell us about it.

14:44.925 --> 14:46.760
No, she really has to get going.

14:46.844 --> 14:49.096
No, she doesn't.

14:49.179 --> 14:51.557
And she's gonna need way more snacks.

14:54.977 --> 14:55.936
[exhales]

14:56.270 --> 14:57.187
So...

14:58.188 --> 15:01.150
you'll never "Guess-ica" who I ran into.

15:01.775 --> 15:04.069
-Jessica? You ran into Jessica Gibson?
-Uh-huh.

15:04.153 --> 15:05.863
Please tell me she was wearing
winter Crocs.

15:05.946 --> 15:09.825
What? No. No, her shoes were nice.
And she looked really great, by the way.

15:09.909 --> 15:11.452
-Not helping.
-Why?

15:11.535 --> 15:14.288
Because she broke my heart
into a thousand pieces, Coyote.

15:14.580 --> 15:16.665
I couldn't walk,
I couldn't get out of bed,

15:16.749 --> 15:20.502
and I still would've taken her back
because she's just so fucking fantastic.

15:20.586 --> 15:24.048
Wait, seriously? Why do I not remember
you feeling this way?

15:24.131 --> 15:25.966
Because you were living
at a Long John Silver's

15:26.050 --> 15:27.509
and couldn't feel your teeth.

15:28.260 --> 15:31.388
The worst part was Jessica
broke up with me by text.

15:31.472 --> 15:32.932
-Ooh.
-And... And...

15:33.015 --> 15:34.975
It was the first text I ever got.

15:35.392 --> 15:37.478
I still remember it word for word.

15:37.561 --> 15:41.690
"It's rover between us.
It's not you, it's meat."

15:41.899 --> 15:42.733
Jeez.

15:42.816 --> 15:45.027
I mean, she broke up with me in person
a few times before that,

15:45.110 --> 15:46.070
but, you know, still...

15:46.612 --> 15:47.488
Oh.

15:48.656 --> 15:51.617
Well, you know, I-I don't think
Jessica knows you feel so--

15:51.700 --> 15:54.328
I'm sorry, did you talk about me with her?

15:55.412 --> 15:56.455
No.

15:57.164 --> 15:59.917
No! No, no, no. It was--
It was just a quick pass-by.

16:00.000 --> 16:04.004
-Where?
-A car... painting... store.

16:04.088 --> 16:05.631
A car painting store?

16:05.714 --> 16:07.383
I like the smells in there.

16:08.300 --> 16:10.469
I don't even know what I would do
if I ever ran into her.

16:11.053 --> 16:12.471
Yeah, but you've got Allison now.

16:12.554 --> 16:13.597
Thank God.

16:14.098 --> 16:15.307
But before Allison...

16:16.558 --> 16:17.518
Jessica...

16:17.977 --> 16:22.022
she had this way
of making me feel great about me.

16:23.190 --> 16:25.192
That's a nice quality to be around.

16:25.693 --> 16:26.777
Very true.

16:35.411 --> 16:37.663
A seat for a toilet?

16:37.746 --> 16:38.914
Don't they have those?

16:39.289 --> 16:41.834
Yes, but this one would be different.

16:42.543 --> 16:43.711
For older folks.

16:44.044 --> 16:45.170
Don't they have those?

16:45.254 --> 16:49.133
They do. They do. They have lots of things
to help older people.

16:49.383 --> 16:50.926
I mean, much older than us.

16:51.343 --> 16:54.722
Grace, you could never relate
to not being able to get off the toilet,

16:55.305 --> 16:59.476
but put yourself in their shuffling,
orthopedic shoes a moment.

16:59.768 --> 17:05.024
Eighty-one percent of falls occur
for older people in the bathroom.

17:05.774 --> 17:07.026
This is sad.

17:07.109 --> 17:09.153
Could we wrap this up?
I have to do clubbing.

17:09.528 --> 17:12.114
You know what's not sad,
I-Forget-Your-Name?

17:12.698 --> 17:15.743
A toilet seat that can give
a little lift to your day

17:15.951 --> 17:17.995
and keep you from dying.

17:18.078 --> 17:19.121
Oh, now we're dying?

17:19.204 --> 17:20.998
Yes, Joan-Margaret's mother--

17:21.081 --> 17:24.001
Well, I'll let her tell you that.
Where is JM?

17:24.084 --> 17:25.461
Oh, I think she went to the bathroom.

17:25.544 --> 17:27.588
-Joan-Margaret?
-Oh, God.

17:27.671 --> 17:29.715
[Joan-Margaret] Mayday! Mayday!

17:30.924 --> 17:34.720
Grace, how do you manage
with this crazy-low thing?

17:35.054 --> 17:37.306
Pilates. Not a problem.

17:37.389 --> 17:38.432
[chuckles]

17:39.391 --> 17:41.310
Okay, let's not hang out in here.

17:41.393 --> 17:42.394
Come on.

17:43.395 --> 17:47.399
[exhales] You wanted snacks.
I got snacks for you.

17:47.483 --> 17:48.901
Well, what are you doing?

17:49.735 --> 17:53.906
How about explaining to the two of us
how "not a problem" this is?

17:53.989 --> 17:54.990
Oh, come on, Frankie.

17:55.074 --> 17:58.285
I was having a good day,
working out, hanging with the girls.

17:58.368 --> 18:01.705
And then you and Joan-Margaret come over
and you make me feel...

18:01.789 --> 18:03.082
What? Old?

18:03.165 --> 18:04.625
Yeah, okay?

18:06.919 --> 18:07.878
Yeah.

18:08.504 --> 18:12.633
Wow, you really just said that.

18:25.145 --> 18:29.441
I've found the perfect
honeymoon boat trip, the Figawi.

18:30.400 --> 18:34.530
Remember growing up, that fun trip
that all the sailboaters did?

18:34.613 --> 18:36.281
From Hyannis to Nantucket.

18:36.365 --> 18:41.161
The Figawi, I've just learned
it's called that because it sounds like--

18:41.245 --> 18:43.122
-"Where the fuck are we?"
-Yes.

18:43.205 --> 18:44.414
Love that.

18:45.457 --> 18:48.794
Anyway, it's in May, so we should book.

18:48.877 --> 18:53.507
Sol, where the Figawi
with the bigger question at hand?

18:54.258 --> 18:56.510
You mean, renting our boat?

18:56.593 --> 18:58.095
-Boat?
-[Carl whimpers]

18:58.178 --> 19:00.180
How can you focus on boats?!

19:02.391 --> 19:07.437
Listen, I've tried to be respectful
and give you your space

19:07.521 --> 19:11.692
so you could get over the shock
and make the right decision here.

19:12.568 --> 19:14.736
And you know the right decision?

19:14.820 --> 19:16.989
I do. And I called that surgeon

19:17.072 --> 19:21.535
and made an appointment for a consultation
before he leaves on a trip to Europe.

19:21.618 --> 19:23.370
By boat, ironically.

19:23.453 --> 19:25.706
Europe. Let's do that, too.

19:26.206 --> 19:28.876
-Sol...
-Cancel that appointment.

19:28.959 --> 19:30.669
I'm not having the surgery.

19:30.752 --> 19:32.629
Not now. Maybe never.

19:33.630 --> 19:36.049
We're going to do the Figawi first.

19:36.967 --> 19:38.844
And lots of other things first.

19:38.927 --> 19:43.473
Sol, I know I said how much
a honeymoon boat trip meant to me--

19:43.557 --> 19:48.437
Stop. Quality of life
is more important to me

19:48.520 --> 19:50.981
than the time I may or may not have left.

19:51.064 --> 19:55.194
But I want you here, in whatever shape,
for as long as possible.

19:55.569 --> 19:57.696
This surgery is preventative.

19:57.779 --> 19:59.448
I heard the doctor.

20:00.032 --> 20:02.868
It prevents me
from doing everything I want.

20:02.951 --> 20:04.203
Who gets to do everything?

20:04.286 --> 20:06.747
I can swim now, Robert.

20:06.830 --> 20:09.791
And I want to keep on swimming.

20:09.875 --> 20:13.670
And I want to keep on
rolling around with Carl

20:13.754 --> 20:16.173
and rolling around with you!

20:17.799 --> 20:19.176
That came out wrong.

20:19.509 --> 20:24.598
Rolling around with you and Carl
are very different rolling arounds.

20:24.890 --> 20:27.351
Is that what this is about? Our sex life?

20:27.726 --> 20:29.645
Sol, your health

20:29.728 --> 20:32.105
is far more important to me than that.

20:32.189 --> 20:33.315
It doesn't matter.

20:33.398 --> 20:34.650
It matters to me.

20:36.944 --> 20:42.282
And I don't want to start down this road
of losing things.

20:43.075 --> 20:44.826
It's a slippery slope.

20:45.202 --> 20:46.787
And I don't get a say in this?

20:47.496 --> 20:48.413
No.

20:48.956 --> 20:50.082
You don't.

20:51.375 --> 20:53.502
This is my walnut.

21:04.388 --> 21:07.307
I came up with this whole idea
to help you.

21:07.391 --> 21:08.809
I'm not asking for help.

21:08.892 --> 21:12.396
But you need it, clearly.
And a lot of other people need it, too.

21:12.479 --> 21:15.065
This is a fantastic idea.

21:15.148 --> 21:18.026
Oh, Frankie, there's no "this"
to even point to.

21:18.777 --> 21:21.029
This is a fantasy that lives in your head.

21:21.113 --> 21:22.948
Yeah, till we get the hydraulics.

21:23.031 --> 21:24.783
Oh, God, you are relentless!

21:24.866 --> 21:26.994
-We love that about me.
-[slight chuckle]

21:27.077 --> 21:30.497
And I'm already working on a new name,
The Queen Latrine.

21:31.748 --> 21:33.333
Okay, maybe that's not the winner,

21:33.417 --> 21:36.503
-but how about The Yes-I-Can Can?
-[exhales]

21:36.586 --> 21:41.049
Oh, God, no, you can't-can't.
Frankie, this isn't what we do.

21:41.133 --> 21:42.426
This is exactly what we do.

21:42.509 --> 21:45.304
We take an obstacle
and we make an opportunity.

21:45.387 --> 21:48.307
-Look what we did with the vibrator.
-[scoffs]

21:48.390 --> 21:53.645
We made our vibrator so women like us
could feel young and sexy.

21:53.729 --> 21:57.190
We made our vibrator
because of your arthritis.

21:58.859 --> 22:03.905
But the difference is, we didn't make it
until you admitted you needed it.

22:04.281 --> 22:06.992
And you didn't have
that stupid thing on your head.

22:08.577 --> 22:09.619
Oh, God.

22:10.245 --> 22:11.246
[exhales]

22:11.955 --> 22:13.665
-Oh.
-[Joan-Margaret] Mayday!

22:14.082 --> 22:15.709
Now she's stuck on the couch.

22:15.792 --> 22:17.878
This place is a death trap.

22:21.381 --> 22:24.384
I know that it's weird to say
that I'd love to ask you out,

22:24.468 --> 22:27.471
and I can never ask you out
in the same sentence,

22:27.554 --> 22:29.181
over one coffee, but--

22:29.264 --> 22:30.265
-It is a first.
-[inhales]

22:30.891 --> 22:31.725
It's just...

22:31.808 --> 22:33.060
[exhales]

22:33.602 --> 22:34.978
It's too complicated...

22:36.063 --> 22:38.398
with Bud and his feelings.

22:38.857 --> 22:41.193
-I get it. He's your brother.
-Yeah.

22:41.777 --> 22:44.529
He's not still saying
I broke up with him by text, is he?

22:44.613 --> 22:45.572
Yeah.

22:46.114 --> 22:47.574
But he walked it back.

22:49.951 --> 22:51.995
Well, this is the mature call.

22:52.579 --> 22:53.580
Agreed.

22:54.414 --> 22:55.791
I don't get that a lot.

22:57.209 --> 22:58.293
But, hey, um...

22:59.002 --> 22:59.920
for the record,

23:00.587 --> 23:03.006
you were into me, right?

23:04.633 --> 23:05.675
[chuckles]

23:08.011 --> 23:08.929
[chuckles]

23:09.012 --> 23:10.680
[inhales deeply]

23:11.139 --> 23:12.808
-[exhales]
-Hug goodbye?

23:12.891 --> 23:13.809
Yeah.

23:15.560 --> 23:16.520
[exhales]

23:20.023 --> 23:22.818
I want you to know
I'm really impressed by you.

23:23.235 --> 23:26.321
You really turned your life around
in a huge way.

23:26.905 --> 23:27.989
Thanks.

23:29.199 --> 23:31.701
Can I give you one last piece of advice?

23:31.785 --> 23:32.786
Yeah.

23:33.286 --> 23:35.122
You're not that guy anymore.

23:35.831 --> 23:38.208
Be confident with who you are now.

23:39.167 --> 23:40.001
Who's that?

23:41.711 --> 23:42.921
A nice guy...

23:44.214 --> 23:47.509
whose arms look really good in that shirt.

23:55.976 --> 23:56.935
Hey, Jess?

24:16.830 --> 24:17.831
Oops.

24:22.085 --> 24:22.919
[exhales]

24:23.044 --> 24:25.046
[whispers] One, two, three. [grunts]

24:25.130 --> 24:26.089
[exhales]

24:27.048 --> 24:28.467
[exhales] Oh.

24:29.926 --> 24:30.969
[grunts]

24:33.972 --> 24:34.931
[exhales]

24:36.016 --> 24:37.934
I know, I know.

24:38.894 --> 24:41.021
You don't have to give me that look.

24:43.106 --> 24:44.316
Oh, God.

24:45.275 --> 24:47.277
[ducks quacking]

24:53.700 --> 24:56.786
We're not taking this
all the way to Nantucket, are we?

24:57.329 --> 24:59.372
I doubt I could pedal that far.

25:02.459 --> 25:03.752
This is silly.

25:04.044 --> 25:06.755
No. It's me and you on the water.

25:06.838 --> 25:09.674
And you never even knew
this was 20 minutes away.

25:09.758 --> 25:11.259
No idea.

25:12.469 --> 25:15.222
This is all I ever need
of a boat ride, Sol.

25:16.223 --> 25:17.974
As long as you're here with me.

25:18.308 --> 25:20.519
I know this is your decision to make,

25:21.561 --> 25:23.897
and I'll respect whatever you want to do.

25:26.900 --> 25:28.652
-Really?
-Really.

25:32.364 --> 25:34.699
I want to not have cancer.

25:35.659 --> 25:37.244
I want that, too.

25:37.327 --> 25:40.247
It's all I've wanted
since I got that stupid news.

25:43.667 --> 25:47.087
If I could just get some control
over this damn thing.

25:50.590 --> 25:52.717
There is some control you have.

25:53.718 --> 25:54.928
Get rid of it.

25:55.971 --> 25:57.347
See how it feels?

26:12.988 --> 26:13.989
Well?

26:16.658 --> 26:20.579
Aside from possibly tearing
my rotator cuff, that felt good.

26:21.955 --> 26:23.331
Like a relief.

26:23.415 --> 26:26.042
Like I can live without that walnut.

26:49.899 --> 26:53.320
Sorry, JM, I got depressed,
I went to Build-A-Bear.

26:54.154 --> 26:56.406
I built a whole bear family.

26:57.449 --> 26:58.366
[exhales]

26:59.242 --> 27:02.120
JM? Still around?

27:02.370 --> 27:04.205
[Joan-Margaret] I'm out here.

27:11.087 --> 27:15.425
Shouldn't you be with your tween friends,
Jayden and Craisin?

27:15.508 --> 27:17.385
I've come to apologize.

27:17.761 --> 27:19.721
Would you-- Would you sit down, please?

27:22.807 --> 27:24.434
What's going on out here?

27:25.477 --> 27:29.022
When you left the other day,
I felt really terrible.

27:30.065 --> 27:32.651
You know, to say that you could
ever make me feel old

27:32.734 --> 27:35.695
is just totally unfair, Frankie.

27:35.987 --> 27:39.699
[sighs] I do a fine job of that...
all by myself.

27:39.783 --> 27:41.576
What you were trying to tell me is

27:41.660 --> 27:45.538
the only way you can change how you feel
is to do something about it.

27:45.872 --> 27:48.208
I'm very smart that way, Grace. I'm--

27:48.291 --> 27:50.627
-I'm our generation's Yoda.
-[chuckles]

27:51.503 --> 27:53.713
-Well, you were right.
-[Frankie chuckles]

27:54.214 --> 27:57.342
