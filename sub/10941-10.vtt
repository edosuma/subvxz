00:01.000 --> 00:02.300
<i>Previously on "Heartland:"</i>

00:02.401 --> 00:04.235
Yeah, I gotta see a woman
about a horse.

00:04.302 --> 00:05.869
In Golden B.C.?

00:05.936 --> 00:07.637
Isn't that like 300 kilometres
from here?

00:07.703 --> 00:08.903
Not as the crow flies.

00:08.971 --> 00:10.437
You haven't lost assistant
yet.

00:10.503 --> 00:11.503
Yeah, but Amy...

00:11.571 --> 00:13.004
I know,
it's our last day.

00:13.070 --> 00:14.670
No, whatever!
I...

00:14.738 --> 00:16.672
It just would've been nice
to spend some time together.

00:16.738 --> 00:18.606
<i>Okay, you know what?</i>
<i>I don't care!</i>

00:18.672 --> 00:20.006
<i>Yeah, do what you want.</i>

00:23.074 --> 00:24.774
Really?

00:24.841 --> 00:26.007
<i>Well, it looks like you're</i>
<i>gonna be a good father one day.</i>

00:26.074 --> 00:28.175
That's definitely
part of the plan.

00:28.242 --> 00:29.476
What plan?

00:29.541 --> 00:30.408
Life plan.

00:30.476 --> 00:31.709
What do you think?

00:31.775 --> 00:32.942
<i>Ty:</i>
<i>Amy would love this!</i>

00:33.009 --> 00:34.510
That's why
I'm giving to you.

00:34.577 --> 00:35.510
See you, Jane.

00:35.578 --> 00:37.345
(Plane buzzes overhead)

00:37.411 --> 00:38.877
Where are they?
Are they all right?

00:38.945 --> 00:42.046
That's the thing,
we don't know.

00:42.113 --> 00:44.481

Everyone's gonna
love this.

01:12.053 --> 01:15.088
<i>I never thought I'd get it done</i>
<i>in time for the party.</i>

01:15.154 --> 01:16.354
Isn't that a cool shot?

01:16.421 --> 01:17.854
Jack:
That's pretty good...

01:17.921 --> 01:19.955
Lou: Hey, um, can I
borrow you for a second?

01:20.021 --> 01:23.991
Oh, Lou, I'm bonding with Jack
over beer here.

01:24.056 --> 01:27.226
Okay. You know that whole
life plan thing?

01:28.158 --> 01:30.291
The career, the girl,
the fun,

01:30.358 --> 01:31.825
the babies, the marriage?

01:31.891 --> 01:32.958
Oh yeah, sure.

01:33.025 --> 01:34.159
You got the order wrong
though.

01:34.226 --> 01:36.693
It's not about the order.

01:37.627 --> 01:38.927
Maybe I'm being
sensitive here -

01:38.993 --> 01:40.427
tell me if I am, okay?
Tell me -

01:40.495 --> 01:44.697
but you didn't mention me
anywhere in your plan,

01:44.762 --> 01:46.529
or if I'm even in it.
(Phone rings)

01:46.595 --> 01:47.928
That's important,

01:47.996 --> 01:49.630
because we're not
just playing around...

01:49.695 --> 01:50.662
<i>(Phone rings)</i>
<i>Can you...?</i>

01:50.730 --> 01:52.164
(Sighs)
Just...

01:52.230 --> 01:53.130
Lou...

01:53.197 --> 01:55.265
Hello?

01:55.331 --> 01:56.731
Amy...

01:59.666 --> 02:02.300
Oh no.

02:04.867 --> 02:06.535
(Truck rumbles to a stop)

02:08.667 --> 02:10.335
Grandpa!

02:10.401 --> 02:13.037
they don't know where they are.
They lost radio contact!

02:13.103 --> 02:15.704
It's okay. It's okay.

02:15.770 --> 02:18.938
Happens all the time
with these small planes.

02:19.003 --> 02:20.137
Maybe they ran
into some weather

02:20.204 --> 02:21.804
and set down somewhere.

02:21.870 --> 02:23.671
Maybe they never even left?

02:23.739 --> 02:25.140
You think so?

02:25.205 --> 02:26.905
Plane's late,
that's all.

02:26.972 --> 02:28.206
We don't know
anything else,

02:28.274 --> 02:31.109
so we're not jumping
to conclusions.

04:33.306 --> 04:34.773
<i>Jennifer:</i>
<i>We have airport confirmation</i>

04:34.838 --> 04:38.208
that they took off
from Golden B.C. at 3:45 pm,

04:38.274 --> 04:40.107
but failed to arrive
at the Hudson airport

04:40.175 --> 04:41.340
as scheduled.

04:41.407 --> 04:42.940
Maybe they ran
into some weather.

04:43.007 --> 04:44.275
Well, there were reports

04:44.341 --> 04:45.841
of some severe
wind conditions

04:45.908 --> 04:46.741
in the Rockies,

04:46.809 --> 04:47.976
just south of Golden.

04:48.043 --> 04:50.010
Might've caused them
to change course.

04:50.327 --> 04:51.828
Or land somewhere else?

04:51.894 --> 04:53.494
We checked on that.

04:53.561 --> 04:54.728
If they were in trouble,

04:54.795 --> 04:56.261
Scott coulda come down
in a field

04:56.328 --> 04:58.295
or some other flat area.

04:58.361 --> 04:59.228
That's true.

04:59.295 --> 05:00.529
And an experienced pilot

05:00.596 --> 05:02.297
certainly would've
been able to do that.

05:02.362 --> 05:05.498
Unfortunately, we don't have
any reports of sightings

05:05.564 --> 05:07.899
of aircraft landing.

05:07.964 --> 05:09.932
<i>Usually we do get calls.</i>

05:09.998 --> 05:11.599
And they have that box,
right?

05:11.666 --> 05:13.066
The, the locater...

05:13.133 --> 05:14.866
The transponder.

05:14.932 --> 05:16.332
They'd be getting
a signal from that.

05:16.400 --> 05:18.367
Well, that's the thing,
Mr. Bartlett.

05:18.434 --> 05:20.568
The box would have sent off
a signal immediately

05:20.635 --> 05:22.502
if there had been
an unscheduled

05:22.569 --> 05:24.603
emergency landing,

05:24.669 --> 05:26.169
and that hasn't happened.

05:26.236 --> 05:28.805
So, that means
they didn't...

05:28.870 --> 05:30.837
<i>Go down, right?</i>

05:30.903 --> 05:33.905
Jennifer: No, it just means that
we don't have locater data.

05:33.971 --> 05:37.474
<i>And without that,</i>
<i>or any sightings,</i>

05:37.539 --> 05:39.506
it's just too big an area
to cover.

05:39.573 --> 05:41.006
Mm... meaning?

05:41.073 --> 05:42.641
At this time,
it...

05:42.707 --> 05:44.274
We don't have
a reasonable area

05:44.340 --> 05:45.473
for a ground search.

05:45.541 --> 05:46.373
<i>Amy:</i>
<i>No.</i>

05:46.442 --> 05:47.608
No, you gotta search.

05:47.674 --> 05:48.674
And we will,

05:48.742 --> 05:49.909
as soon as we have
a better idea

05:49.975 --> 05:51.208
of where to begin.

05:51.275 --> 05:52.409
In the meantime,

05:52.476 --> 05:53.676
the local SAR-Teams
have been notified,

05:53.744 --> 05:55.344
and they'll be sending out
an aerial search

05:55.410 --> 05:57.711

The last thing we did
was fight.

06:18.282 --> 06:19.583
l made him feel bad

06:19.650 --> 06:21.517

away from me, and...

06:28.653 --> 06:32.422
Oh honey, don't.
Don't go down that road.

07:32.603 --> 07:33.670

07:49.507 --> 07:52.109
Careful.

<i>(Pants and moans, pained)</i>

Tourniquet.

08:05.546 --> 08:06.612
Stem the blood flow.

08:06.611 --> 08:07.678
Right here.

08:09.679 --> 08:10.979
Okay...

08:11.046 --> 08:12.947
Ready?
(Preparatory breaths)

08:13.013 --> 08:14.814
(Groans)

08:14.880 --> 08:16.180
Here we go.

Scott: That's good. That's good.

08:17.814 --> 08:18.747
<i>Ty:</i>
<i>All right.</i>

08:18.815 --> 08:20.449
(Moans in pain)

08:20.514 --> 08:21.848
Yeah, yeah,
I know it's a big area,

08:21.915 --> 08:23.783
but we gotta start somewhere,
don't we?

08:23.849 --> 08:25.383
How soon can you get
our guys up there?

08:26.316 --> 08:28.017
Okay, so, this is where
the storm was.

08:28.083 --> 08:29.584
I checked it out
on the Internet.

08:29.651 --> 08:32.519
So the plane probably landed
somewhere around here

08:32.585 --> 08:34.351
and this is where
we should start looking.

08:34.418 --> 08:36.587
Uh, we should probably
drive out there right now.

08:36.652 --> 08:38.587
Amy, you heard what
the officer said.

08:38.653 --> 08:40.688
It would be like looking
for a flea

08:40.753 --> 08:41.919
on a football field.

08:41.986 --> 08:43.054
We've gotta do something,
Grandpa!

08:43.120 --> 08:46.389
Well, what we can do
is we can stay calm.

08:46.454 --> 08:48.521
We're probably gonna
get a call any minute

08:48.589 --> 08:49.655
sayin' they're just fine.

08:49.722 --> 08:50.854
(Phone rings)

08:52.056 --> 08:53.189
What'd I say?

08:53.255 --> 08:54.322
(Phone rings)

08:54.990 --> 08:56.057
Hello?

08:57.356 --> 08:58.090
It's your dad.

<i>Yeah.</i>

08:59.757 --> 09:00.757
<i>We're fine.</i>

09:00.825 --> 09:02.693
All right,
we'll see ya.

09:02.759 --> 09:04.827
He's, uh...
He's on his way over.

09:06.226 --> 09:08.093
Mallory,
I should drive you home.

09:08.159 --> 09:09.594
<i>It's gettin' late.</i>

09:09.660 --> 09:12.195
No. I want to be here
in case we hear something.

09:12.261 --> 09:14.797
I phoned my parents,
they understand.

09:15.012 --> 09:16.246

<i>It's Ty and Scott -</i>
<i>they can't find 'em.</i>

Hey.

09:44.587 --> 09:46.722
What're you doing?

09:46.787 --> 09:49.389
People have to eat,
right?

09:49.455 --> 09:50.521
Yeah.

09:51.356 --> 09:52.556
Scott had only
had his license

09:52.623 --> 09:54.690
for a few months.

09:54.757 --> 09:57.991
(Sniffles)
What if he had to...?

09:59.023 --> 10:00.991
I mean maybe he wasn't
experienced enough to...

10:01.057 --> 10:03.425
Hey, listen.

10:03.491 --> 10:05.225
Search and Rescue
have volunteer crews

10:05.293 --> 10:07.761
all over the area,
okay?

10:07.826 --> 10:11.595
If they're out there,
they're gonna find them.

10:11.660 --> 10:13.894
<i>Amy:</i>
<i>Don't say "if."</i>

10:15.562 --> 10:19.131
There is no "if."
They'll find them.

10:22.096 --> 10:23.497
(Sighs heavily)

10:27.031 --> 10:29.332
Hey, Harley.

10:29.398 --> 10:31.232
You're a good boy.

10:39.134 --> 10:40.534
Oh, I'm so sorry.

10:41.769 --> 10:43.902
It's gonna be okay.

10:46.135 --> 10:47.369
Ty:
How is it?

10:47.870 --> 10:49.871
Scott:
Good. It's good.

<i>Ty:</i>
<i>Look, I don't know how,</i>

10:52.837 --> 10:54.672
but we're gonna have to get
that piece of metal outta your leg.

10:54.739 --> 10:56.606
No. Forget it.
I can put up with the pain.

10:56.673 --> 10:57.806
I'm serious, man.

10:57.873 --> 10:58.973
No, it won't be long.

10:59.039 --> 11:01.440
They'll find us
when it gets light.

11:02.373 --> 11:04.007
Yeah, you're right.

11:04.941 --> 11:06.976
They'll find us.

11:07.042 --> 11:09.778
(Wolves howl nearby)

11:26.792 --> 11:28.926
Amy:
So, um, a plane went down?

11:28.993 --> 11:30.058
Someone saw it?

11:30.126 --> 11:30.959
<i>Jennifer:</i>
<i>A farmer,</i>

11:31.027 --> 11:32.094
just south of Golden,

11:32.159 --> 11:34.427
at about 4:05
yesterday afternoon.

11:34.494 --> 11:36.561
<i>We've got someone on it.</i>

11:36.628 --> 11:37.795
We've also narrowed down
the area

11:37.862 --> 11:39.229
where they lost
radio contact

11:39.296 --> 11:40.662
with the Cessna.

11:40.729 --> 11:42.597
So, a ground team went out
first thing this morning

11:42.662 --> 11:44.563
<i>and an air search</i>
<i>is in the works as well.</i>

11:44.631 --> 11:46.465
Tim: How many planes and
choppers do you have out there?

11:46.530 --> 11:47.830
I'd have to check that...

11:47.897 --> 11:48.998
Are you coordinating
with the SAR-Teams?

11:49.064 --> 11:50.298
I mean, how long
can two guys last

11:50.365 --> 11:51.931
out there like that?

11:51.999 --> 11:53.432
<i>The temperature went down</i>
<i>last night - way down.</i>

11:53.499 --> 11:54.565
Tim, why don't you just-

11:54.633 --> 11:56.368
Jack! I'm serious.

11:57.301 --> 11:58.468
We don't want this to go

11:58.533 --> 11:59.367
from a search
and rescue mission

11:59.434 --> 12:00.401
to a recovery mission.

12:00.469 --> 12:01.635
Dad!

12:01.702 --> 12:03.035
Sir, we're doing everything
in our power

12:03.102 --> 12:04.902
to make sure that
that doesn't happen.

12:05.835 --> 12:06.903
Well, that's great.

12:06.969 --> 12:09.004
<i>(Radio)</i> <i>- Officer Patterson,</i> <i>do you copy?</i>
- Excuse me.

12:09.769 --> 12:11.204
<i>Officer: (Over radio)</i>
<i>We've located a plane.</i>

12:11.271 --> 12:13.239
(Hushed conversation)

12:13.305 --> 12:15.072
Wanna take a look
at that?

12:15.138 --> 12:16.805
<i>Officer: (Over radio)</i> <i>We'll
keep you posted,</i> <i>over.</i>

12:16.872 --> 12:20.440
They've identified
the downed plane.

12:22.507 --> 12:24.708
It's not Mr. Cardinal's.

12:25.641 --> 12:27.575
I'll keep you posted.

12:28.509 --> 12:31.844
And I do understand
what you're all going through.

12:31.910 --> 12:32.977
Thank you.

12:33.911 --> 12:35.143
Peter:
Thanks.

12:37.912 --> 12:40.079
Okay. So, good.
They're going full throttle,

12:40.145 --> 12:41.579
and, listen,
I want you to know

12:41.645 --> 12:43.613
it's not just the RCMP
out there either, okay?

12:43.679 --> 12:45.780
I've got Bedford's choppers
ready to take off as well.

12:45.847 --> 12:47.147
Thanks, Peter.

12:47.214 --> 12:49.015
<i>Peter:</i>
<i>Yeah?</i>

12:49.080 --> 12:50.481
Okay, great.

12:50.548 --> 12:51.681
All right, they've narrowed
down the area,

12:51.747 --> 12:52.914
I got the coordinates.

12:52.982 --> 12:55.416
Let's go take a look
at that map.

12:56.817 --> 12:59.351
Amy: Okay. So it's part of
this huge provincial park.

12:59.417 --> 13:00.684
Right. Which means
the Parks department

13:00.751 --> 13:02.151
will have all their guys
out there, too.

13:02.218 --> 13:06.354
Okay, so, they've got guys
and you've got helicopters,

13:06.419 --> 13:08.653
but we need to go out there
and look for them ourselves.

13:08.719 --> 13:09.919
Okay, how can we expect
someone else

13:09.987 --> 13:11.253
to do something
we should be doing?

13:11.320 --> 13:12.320
Well, you know,
even though

13:12.387 --> 13:14.187
they've narrowed down
the area quite a bit,

13:14.254 --> 13:15.922
it's still way too big
to search on horseback

13:15.988 --> 13:17.287
or on foot.

13:17.355 --> 13:19.156
No! This is Ty
we're talking about, okay?

13:19.222 --> 13:20.322
And Scott.

13:20.390 --> 13:21.657
They are out there somewhere

13:21.723 --> 13:23.155
and we're not doing
anything about it?

13:23.223 --> 13:24.289
Look,
I know how you feel.

13:24.356 --> 13:26.290
No! No you don't!
You-

13:26.356 --> 13:27.824
Amy,
just listen to me.

13:27.892 --> 13:29.458
These search
and rescue guys,

13:29.525 --> 13:30.858
they're local, okay?

13:30.926 --> 13:32.994
They know this area
like the back of their hand.

13:33.059 --> 13:34.059
This is what they do.

13:34.127 --> 13:36.629
It's what they're trained
to do.

13:36.694 --> 13:39.929
They're gonna find Ty
and Scott.

13:41.293 --> 13:42.961
Ah... we got water,

13:45.094 --> 13:46.161
a tarp...

13:51.731 --> 13:53.532
My painting survived.

13:56.331 --> 13:58.633
<i>I got a parachute flare!</i>

13:58.698 --> 14:00.900
You see a first aid kit?

14:00.967 --> 14:02.267
Yeah.

14:02.333 --> 14:04.601
It's pretty much a write off
though.

14:04.667 --> 14:06.668
So is the parachute flare...

14:06.735 --> 14:08.402
<i>But your vet kit looks good.</i>

14:08.468 --> 14:10.236
Pfft! Great.

14:10.302 --> 14:12.403
I can inoculate a few bears.

14:13.336 --> 14:15.337
<i>You see a radio?</i>

14:15.403 --> 14:16.670
<i>Ty:</i>
<i>Yeah.</i>

14:16.738 --> 14:18.304
<i>Not so good.</i>

14:19.871 --> 14:21.739
Hey! Got a flashlight...

14:22.672 --> 14:24.406
<i>Bingo! Flares.</i>

14:25.472 --> 14:26.139
(Pants)

14:27.273 --> 14:28.273
Correction.

14:28.673 --> 14:30.240
One flare.

14:30.307 --> 14:33.076
The most important thing to do
is find that transponder.

14:33.141 --> 14:34.307
Where's that?

14:34.374 --> 14:35.474
<i>Scott:</i>
<i>It's near the tail area.</i>

14:35.543 --> 14:37.010
It's small,
it's yellow.

14:37.076 --> 14:38.443
There should be
a red flashing light

14:38.509 --> 14:39.275
<i>on the top of it.</i>

14:39.343 --> 14:40.677
Yeah, I got it!

14:44.176 --> 14:45.710
(Pants)

14:45.778 --> 14:50.081
<i>The light's not flashing.</i>
<i>What does that mean?</i>

14:50.146 --> 14:51.413
What?

14:51.479 --> 14:53.714
Means it's not working.

14:53.781 --> 14:55.448
Maybe it never did.

14:57.514 --> 15:00.415
(Sighs)
No one knows where we are.

15:01.682 --> 15:03.182
(Transponder thunks heavily)

15:03.499 --> 15:05.033
And you're telling me
after 24 hours

15:05.100 --> 15:07.133
you have no information?

15:08.065 --> 15:09.232
None?!

15:09.301 --> 15:10.701
Well, what's the deal?

15:10.767 --> 15:12.367
What the hell are you people
doing up there?

15:12.435 --> 15:13.935
Yeah, I understand.

15:14.868 --> 15:17.370
Yeah, no, I know, I know,
you'll call us, right?

15:17.436 --> 15:18.703
That's great.

15:18.770 --> 15:21.504
No, you know,
keep up the good work!

15:21.569 --> 15:24.171
(Incredulous chuckle) Dad, you're not
gonna help things by yelling at them.

15:24.236 --> 15:26.070
We need answers, Amy!

15:26.138 --> 15:28.273
We deserve answers.

15:34.274 --> 15:35.641
(Exhales)

15:35.708 --> 15:37.641
Can't believe Jane's painting
made it through.

15:37.707 --> 15:40.609
Yeah.
I think it's a sign.

15:40.675 --> 15:42.409
If wild horses can survive
in the wilderness,

15:42.476 --> 15:43.843
we can too, right?

15:43.909 --> 15:45.042
Yeah.

15:45.110 --> 15:47.077
But we gotta do something.

15:47.143 --> 15:49.878
You got to get
to higher ground.

15:49.945 --> 15:51.913
I'm not leaving you, man.

15:51.978 --> 15:53.445
I don't mean that.

15:53.512 --> 15:55.413
We just need to get some
bearings on where we are.

15:55.479 --> 15:56.780
Take the flare.

15:56.846 --> 15:57.946
If anyone's looking for us,

15:58.013 --> 15:59.480
they'll have started
by now.

16:02.615 --> 16:04.482
Don't get lost...

16:04.548 --> 16:07.216
(Stream rushes,
water splashes)

16:21.753 --> 16:22.886
(Bag rustles)

16:30.254 --> 16:32.155
(Panting and grunting)

16:37.056 --> 16:38.190
(Bag rustles)

16:42.291 --> 16:43.525
(Rocks clatter down hill)

16:46.991 --> 16:48.659
(Dirt cascades down the hill)

16:48.727 --> 16:50.294
(Grunts)

16:50.360 --> 16:52.294
(Pebbles crumble and clatter)

16:52.361 --> 16:53.928
Ungh!

16:55.329 --> 16:56.228
(Grunting)

17:00.329 --> 17:02.396
(Birds twitter and chirp)

17:03.896 --> 17:07.132
(Dramatic music crescendos)

17:15.634 --> 17:16.300
(Pants)

17:26.103 --> 17:27.838
(Yelling loudly)
Hello?!

17:31.404 --> 17:33.539
(Weakly)
Hello...?

17:38.506 --> 17:39.974
(Yelling)
Hellooo?!

17:40.041 --> 17:43.776
("Hello" echoes
through the range)

17:47.475 --> 17:49.643
Ty:
(Pants heavily)

17:50.726 --> 17:52.995
Well, I'm not gonna lie...

17:53.060 --> 17:55.862
We're in the middle
of nowhere.

17:57.128 --> 17:59.863
But the good news is
we're still here

18:00.796 --> 18:02.762
and we're pretty lucky.

18:02.829 --> 18:04.830
Yeah. Real lucky.

18:06.263 --> 18:07.930
I screwed up.

18:09.332 --> 18:10.632
I'm sorry.

18:11.565 --> 18:13.166
Forget it, man.

18:13.232 --> 18:16.101
The down draft took me
by surprise.

18:16.167 --> 18:18.334
I should have gone
to a different altitude.

18:18.400 --> 18:20.801
Hey, you managed
to keep us alive,

18:20.867 --> 18:22.501
didn't you?

18:24.435 --> 18:26.803
We're gonna make it,
Scott.

18:26.869 --> 18:28.103
You're gonna be fine.

18:31.204 --> 18:34.705
No. No, there's no point
in you coming back, Lisa.

18:34.770 --> 18:38.240
Don't you dare
get on a flight.

18:39.605 --> 18:43.341
I'll call you
as soon as I hear... anything.

18:46.741 --> 18:47.975
Yeah...

18:48.042 --> 18:49.775
Okay, bye.

18:51.976 --> 18:53.443
(Phone beeps off)

19:13.948 --> 19:15.749
<i>Amy:</i>
<i>(Sniffles)</i>

19:17.650 --> 19:20.118
(Shaky breaths)

19:26.019 --> 19:27.919
<i>(Horse whinnies below)</i>

19:42.090 --> 19:43.424
Hey, boy.

19:44.357 --> 19:47.426
You're okay.
(Calming exhales)

19:48.925 --> 19:52.261
It's gonna be all right,
huh?

19:52.326 --> 19:54.660
He's gonna come home.

19:56.726 --> 19:58.327
He's gotta come home.

20:00.228 --> 20:02.129
(Inhales deeply)

20:03.262 --> 20:05.497
Hey.
(Grunts and snuffles)

20:08.531 --> 20:09.731
You smell him,
don't ya?

20:09.796 --> 20:11.130
(Harley grunts)

20:12.430 --> 20:14.097
(Half laughs)

20:37.371 --> 20:38.605
(Tarp rustles)

20:40.540 --> 20:42.874
(Murmurs and shivers)

20:44.773 --> 20:46.674
Scott, you okay?

20:48.441 --> 20:49.542
(Dazed moan)

20:50.608 --> 20:52.275
Ty:
You're gonna be fine, man.

20:52.342 --> 20:53.876
I'll get you outta here.

20:53.943 --> 20:57.879
(Tarp rustles,
wolf howls)

21:02.077 --> 21:03.411
(Branches snap)

21:05.646 --> 21:08.881
(Wolf howls nearby,
Ty pants, worried)

21:21.458 --> 21:23.592
And where did you
get this plan?

21:23.658 --> 21:24.757
From Harley.

21:24.823 --> 21:26.224
Harley? When?

21:26.291 --> 21:27.891
Last night.

21:27.958 --> 21:30.760
Look, we take the trailers
to the closest possible road

21:30.825 --> 21:32.526
where they lost radio contact

21:32.592 --> 21:34.260
and then we'll ride the horses
into the mountains from there.

21:34.327 --> 21:37.329
I'll take Harley
'cause he can smell Ty.

21:37.395 --> 21:38.862
Grandpa, he can!

21:38.927 --> 21:40.927
Please, just believe me, okay?

21:40.994 --> 21:42.295
I know it sounds crazy,

21:42.362 --> 21:43.662
but he'll probably lead us
right to them.

21:43.729 --> 21:45.162
Amy, look.

21:45.229 --> 21:47.464
Even if we went to the area
they've narrowed it down to,

21:47.530 --> 21:49.598
<i>that country's almost</i>
<i>impassable.</i>

21:49.664 --> 21:51.064
<i>There's gorges, rivers,</i>

21:51.131 --> 21:53.499
<i>cliffs that a mountain goat</i>
<i>couldn't climb.</i>

21:53.566 --> 21:55.467
We've got to at least try.
Huh?

21:56.499 --> 21:57.999
Dad...

21:58.067 --> 21:59.134
Dad, you said that you were
sick of sitting around,

21:59.199 --> 22:00.666
waiting for someone else
to do something.

22:00.734 --> 22:03.169
This is our chance.
Peter, come on.

22:03.235 --> 22:06.137
We have a map.
We know what area it is.

22:06.202 --> 22:07.836
Please!

22:07.903 --> 22:09.570
Yeah, I'm in.

22:10.670 --> 22:12.837
Okay.
It's better than waiting.

22:12.903 --> 22:14.904
I'm coming too.

22:14.971 --> 22:16.037
Fine.

22:16.104 --> 22:17.304
But someone
has to stay here,

22:17.372 --> 22:19.506
be by the phones,
take care of the place.

22:19.572 --> 22:20.939
I will.

22:21.006 --> 22:23.574
You can't stay here
alone.

22:23.640 --> 22:24.840
Hey.

22:25.474 --> 22:27.942
Is there anything
that we can do to help?

22:31.341 --> 22:34.077
(Trucks rumble along)

22:37.210 --> 22:39.278
(Helicopter rotors beat)

22:41.411 --> 22:43.913
Ty:
Ungh! Damn stupid thing...

22:44.480 --> 22:45.780
It's ruined.

22:45.845 --> 22:47.012
It scared me half to death
last night,

22:47.080 --> 22:48.513
blowing off in the middle
of night.

22:48.579 --> 22:50.313
(Rotors beat nearby)

22:54.048 --> 22:55.115
You hear that?

22:55.547 --> 22:56.547
What?

22:56.615 --> 22:57.816
<i>Ty:</i>
<i>It's a chopper!</i>

22:57.883 --> 22:59.884
Scott: The flare! Use the flare!

22:59.950 --> 23:01.549
(Objects clatter)

23:01.615 --> 23:03.549
(Rotors beat overhead)

23:04.683 --> 23:05.683
(Snaps the top off the flare)

23:05.751 --> 23:07.085
Hey!

23:07.152 --> 23:08.152
Hey!!

23:08.218 --> 23:09.385
<i>Scott:</i>
<i>Hey!</i>

<i>Hey! We're down here!</i>

(Rotors beat loudly)

23:14.254 --> 23:16.321
Ty and Scott: (Screaming) Hey!
We're down here! Hey! Down here!

23:16.388 --> 23:20.390
(Rotors beat loudly
and fade into the distance)

23:32.325 --> 23:34.058
Scott:
(Groans)

23:35.425 --> 23:36.825
<i>Ty:</i> <i>Scott!</i>

23:37.893 --> 23:39.294
Scott, it's gonna be okay,
man.

23:39.360 --> 23:41.395
(Groans)
No, it's not.

23:41.460 --> 23:43.561
My leg...
It's infected.

23:43.628 --> 23:45.095
This damn thing
has got to come out.

23:45.162 --> 23:46.228
(Pained moan)

23:48.430 --> 23:49.962
What do you want me
to do?

23:50.029 --> 23:52.631
Remember the horse -
the wild horse -

23:52.697 --> 23:54.331
how I got the arrow
out of his neck?

23:54.397 --> 23:55.463
Yeah.

23:56.731 --> 23:58.865
That's what you have to do.

23:58.932 --> 24:00.866
Okay, man.

24:04.534 --> 24:06.401
Use the local first.

24:06.467 --> 24:08.468
Jeez, Scott...

24:12.068 --> 24:13.803
(Anesthetic squirts)

24:16.236 --> 24:17.337
Ty:
Three, two, one.

24:17.404 --> 24:18.470
(Groans in pain)

24:22.354 --> 24:23.421
Okay.

24:24.788 --> 24:26.689
(Tight, shaky breaths)

24:31.024 --> 24:32.090
I can't do this.

24:32.157 --> 24:34.725
Stay focused.
You can do this.

24:36.026 --> 24:37.125
(Apprehensive grunt)

24:37.192 --> 24:38.859

Okay, you ready?

24:46.628 --> 24:48.429
Scott:
'Kay. Go.

24:48.494 --> 24:50.495
(Cries out in pain)

24:50.728 --> 24:51.628
I got it!

24:54.462 --> 24:55.596
<i>Scott:</i>
<i>Good.</i>

24:55.663 --> 24:56.663
Get the gauze.

24:56.730 --> 24:57.964

24:58.031 --> 25:00.699
<i>Ty:</i>
<i>I don't think so.</i>

25:00.765 --> 25:02.566
Oh good.
No arteries.

25:03.666 --> 25:05.466
(Pants)
Now the fun part...

25:05.533 --> 25:07.300
You gotta flush it out
with the antiseptic.

25:07.366 --> 25:09.000
(Antiseptic sloshes)

25:09.067 --> 25:11.434
<i>Scott:</i> <i>All right.
</i> <i>Does it look clean?</i>

25:11.499 --> 25:12.399
Yeah.

25:12.467 --> 25:13.734
<i>Scott:</i>
<i>Okay.</i>

25:13.801 --> 25:15.702
Okay.
Then sew 'er up.

25:16.869 --> 25:17.769
<i>Make it pretty.</i>

25:17.835 --> 25:19.202
Ty:
(Half laughs)

25:20.937 --> 25:23.237
(Groans in pain)

25:23.304 --> 25:25.039
Ty:
Hold on, hold on...

25:27.371 --> 25:28.538
Whew...

25:28.605 --> 25:30.806
There's no more gauze.

25:30.872 --> 25:33.106
Better left to the air.

25:34.040 --> 25:35.607
Ty:
Okay.

25:35.674 --> 25:38.241
(Exhales forcefully
and pants)

25:41.575 --> 25:43.842
Scott: You aren't
delivering a baby here.

25:43.908 --> 25:44.975
Relax.

25:46.209 --> 25:47.276
Have a seat.

25:48.744 --> 25:51.145
Ty:
I just need some air.

25:51.211 --> 25:52.278
I'm good.

25:54.712 --> 25:55.946
How're you doing?

25:57.579 --> 25:59.179
Scott:
Hunky dory.

25:59.246 --> 26:00.681
No pain.

26:00.746 --> 26:02.547
Always a good thing.

26:02.614 --> 26:05.482
Shoot me full of that...
Horse medicine, now, would ya?

26:05.548 --> 26:06.615
Okay.

26:08.482 --> 26:09.549
Okay.

26:12.017 --> 26:13.250
(Tight inhale)

26:13.983 --> 26:15.450
Woo! Nicely done.

26:16.784 --> 26:19.786
I must be a good teacher,
eh?

26:20.952 --> 26:22.018
Right.

26:24.019 --> 26:25.352
Good job.

26:26.820 --> 26:28.353
(Horse grunts)

26:28.421 --> 26:29.821
<i>Peter:</i> <i>All right,</i> <i>this is it.</i>

26:29.888 --> 26:31.188
As close as we can get

26:31.254 --> 26:32.822
to where the airport
lost radio contact.

26:32.889 --> 26:34.890
<i>So we'll split up</i>
<i>into two groups.</i>

26:34.956 --> 26:36.890
Jack, you and Tim
can take this quadrant here,

26:36.956 --> 26:39.423
Amy, Lou and myself,
we'll do this one.

26:39.491 --> 26:43.061
Figure we'll go 'til dusk
and meet back here.

26:43.125 --> 26:44.425
Aye, aye, sir.

26:45.358 --> 26:47.726
(Huffs)
You got a problem?

26:48.659 --> 26:50.660
Yeah, guess maybe I do.

26:52.227 --> 26:53.928
I mean I just musta
missed the moment

26:53.994 --> 26:54.961
when you were
put in charge.

26:55.028 --> 26:56.161
Dad, don't...

26:57.562 --> 26:59.763
I don't think this is about
who's in charge.

26:59.829 --> 27:01.563
<i>Jack:</i> <i>This isn't
about</i> <i>you guys either,</i>

27:01.629 --> 27:03.029

27:08.531 --> 27:09.599
Wow.

(Birds twitter and chirp)

(Wolves howl close by)

27:24.836 --> 27:26.303
(Frantic panting)

27:45.541 --> 27:47.209
It was good to do this.

27:48.977 --> 27:50.175
We had to do this.

27:52.342 --> 27:53.409
Hey...

27:54.576 --> 27:56.110
<i>You okay?</i>

27:56.176 --> 27:57.243
Yeah.

28:00.311 --> 28:01.778
<i>Jack:</i> <i>What was that
about</i> <i>back there?</i>

28:01.846 --> 28:04.447
Tim: That PW...
I mean he's got manpower,

28:04.513 --> 28:06.046
and helicopters...

28:06.980 --> 28:08.346
He's got it all.

28:08.413 --> 28:09.379
He's great.

28:09.446 --> 28:11.414
So what's the problem?

28:11.481 --> 28:12.748
Oh, come on, Jack.

28:12.815 --> 28:14.381
You gotta be feeling
the same way I do.

28:14.448 --> 28:16.182
We're useless.

28:16.716 --> 28:18.883
We're helpless out here.

28:18.950 --> 28:20.383
Come on, I hate that.

28:20.450 --> 28:21.584
<i>What're we even doing?</i>

28:21.650 --> 28:23.317
Look, we're doin' something,

28:23.383 --> 28:24.684
and we're gonna find 'em.

28:24.751 --> 28:26.284
Ty didn't go through
all the crap in his life

28:26.351 --> 28:28.319
just so he could get lost.

28:29.251 --> 28:30.351
You love him.

28:30.419 --> 28:31.853
Aw, I just...

28:31.920 --> 28:36.123
Ah, hell, he's, you know...
He's part of the family.

28:36.588 --> 28:38.054
Like a son.

28:40.622 --> 28:41.688
Maybe.

28:44.323 --> 28:45.556
(Horse grunts)

28:48.958 --> 28:50.558
(Grunts of effort)

28:52.458 --> 28:53.858
Hey, Ty,

28:53.925 --> 28:56.627
it doesn't have to be
a perfect boy scout fire.

28:56.692 --> 28:58.893
But it needs to be seen,
right?

28:58.960 --> 29:00.360
We need them
to see it.

29:04.294 --> 29:05.361
(Match flares)

29:11.063 --> 29:12.396
(Fire crackles)

29:14.664 --> 29:15.731
(Moans softly)

29:17.865 --> 29:18.932
Scott.

29:19.898 --> 29:22.233
Have some water, man.

29:27.651 --> 29:28.885
Tim:
Amy? Hey.

29:30.451 --> 29:31.518
Amy:
Hey.

29:33.986 --> 29:35.386
Uh...

29:35.820 --> 29:38.789
Look, honey, I'm sorry
about the way I've...

29:38.853 --> 29:40.754
I've been, uh...

29:41.655 --> 29:42.687
You know.

29:42.754 --> 29:43.821
Okay.

29:45.621 --> 29:47.489
Dad, um...

29:47.555 --> 29:49.023
Just...

29:49.090 --> 29:52.058
Can you try to be a little
more cooperative with Peter?

29:52.123 --> 29:54.758
He knows what he's doing.

29:54.825 --> 29:56.725
Yeah. Oh yeah.

29:56.793 --> 29:58.192
I will.

29:58.259 --> 29:59.458
Good.

29:59.525 --> 30:00.592
'Kay.

30:01.894 --> 30:03.127
(Horse grunts)

30:09.962 --> 30:12.697
Lou: How can you have
a life plan, huh,

30:12.763 --> 30:14.763
when anything can happen...

30:14.830 --> 30:16.063
At any minute?

30:20.265 --> 30:23.200
There's something
I've never told you...

30:23.266 --> 30:24.933
About me and Scott.

30:26.533 --> 30:28.401
Okay.

30:28.467 --> 30:30.234
When we were teenagers...

30:30.300 --> 30:33.402
We had this huge crush thing
goin' on.

30:34.335 --> 30:35.635
(Half laughs)

30:35.701 --> 30:37.435
And then, uh, we both
went away to school,

30:37.502 --> 30:40.737
and I moved to New York...

30:40.804 --> 30:43.738
And we just sorta
lost touch.

30:44.738 --> 30:47.173
And then Mom died...

30:47.238 --> 30:49.039
And I came back

30:50.406 --> 30:52.674
and the feeling
was still there

30:52.739 --> 30:55.474
and we almost got engaged.

30:58.109 --> 31:00.008
(Sighs)

31:00.007 --> 31:01.709
And then he dumped me.

31:01.775 --> 31:02.908
He dumped you?

31:02.975 --> 31:04.943
Yeah. He did.

31:05.009 --> 31:06.876
(Scoffs)

31:07.093 --> 31:08.327
I don't know.

31:08.393 --> 31:11.195
Maybe he saw something
I didn't see...

31:12.127 --> 31:15.463
Anyway, I know
it was for the best -

31:16.396 --> 31:18.729
and I love you,
I do -

31:21.364 --> 31:24.433
but the thought that anything
might've happened to him

31:24.498 --> 31:26.298
is devastating.

31:27.398 --> 31:29.799
Hey. You listen to me.

31:31.366 --> 31:34.068
Now we are gonna do
everything we possibly can

31:34.133 --> 31:36.101
to find him, okay?

31:36.167 --> 31:36.967
You understand?

31:37.034 --> 31:38.101
Yeah.

31:41.235 --> 31:42.569

31:46.036 --> 31:48.071

(Grunts)

31:50.037 --> 31:52.038
(Exhales forcefully)

31:52.304 --> 31:54.438
Any more of those
horse drugs?

31:54.506 --> 31:56.840
Sorry, man.
All gone.

31:58.772 --> 32:01.974
I wish I could have some
for myself.

32:02.906 --> 32:04.374
How're you doin'?

32:08.341 --> 32:10.976
(Wolf howls nearby)

32:12.877 --> 32:14.009
Sounds close.

32:17.044 --> 32:19.945
A little too close.
(Wolf howls)

32:20.879 --> 32:23.781
My grandfather
was an Elder.

32:23.846 --> 32:25.381
Yeah?

32:25.446 --> 32:28.448
He tried to pass his beliefs
on to me...

32:28.514 --> 32:30.414
But I was an idiot.

32:31.347 --> 32:33.114
I never listened.

32:33.182 --> 32:34.748
"The wolf," he said,

32:35.682 --> 32:37.816
"the wolf's the survivor,

32:37.882 --> 32:39.416
the teacher."

32:39.484 --> 32:43.753
All I know is that guy scares
the crap out of me, so...

32:43.818 --> 32:47.654
Never listened to anyone
when I was a kid.

32:47.718 --> 32:49.052
(Groans in pain)

32:52.220 --> 32:54.020

32:54.487 --> 32:55.554

32:56.921 --> 32:57.988
Scott!

32:58.822 --> 33:00.223
Scott, you okay?

33:01.821 --> 33:04.523
You wanna know something?

33:04.589 --> 33:06.623
I'm pretty stupid.

33:06.691 --> 33:08.625
What're you talking about?

33:08.691 --> 33:10.925
Lou. Letting her go.

33:12.659 --> 33:14.092
Dumbest thing I ever did.

33:16.661 --> 33:19.461
If we get out,
I'm gonna go back-

33:19.527 --> 33:21.795
No, there are no "ifs,"
man.

33:21.860 --> 33:24.329
We're gonna make it
outta here, okay?

33:24.395 --> 33:26.862
Big mistake...
I see them.

33:28.295 --> 33:29.594

33:36.165 --> 33:37.599
Yeah.

33:37.665 --> 33:39.065
Yeah, man.

33:42.166 --> 33:43.500
