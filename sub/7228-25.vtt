[Doc reading]

01:04.772 --> 01:06.566
Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad.

01:06.649 --> 01:07.484
Hey, Doc.

01:07.567 --> 01:09.652
Hi, Sweets.
How was school today?

01:10.028 --> 01:10.945
Great.

01:11.029 --> 01:12.739
We had a Valentine's Day party

01:12.822 --> 01:14.949
and gave each other
Valentine cards.

01:16.034 --> 01:19.370
I got a lot, a whole lot.

01:19.621 --> 01:20.955
-[Dad] Nice!
-[Mom] Ooh!

01:21.039 --> 01:23.083
There's one more card
I have to deliver,

01:23.541 --> 01:25.126
and it's the best one.

01:25.418 --> 01:26.461
Close your eyes.

01:30.340 --> 01:31.341
No peeking.

01:31.424 --> 01:33.301
[both giggling]

01:33.676 --> 01:34.886
Ta-da.

01:35.303 --> 01:36.721
How beautiful.
Wow!

01:37.096 --> 01:38.890
Happy Valentine's Day.

01:39.140 --> 01:40.183
[Mom] Aw...

01:40.266 --> 01:42.685
Thanks, Doc. We love it.

01:42.769 --> 01:43.937
Come here, you.

01:44.771 --> 01:46.523
[Doc laughs]

01:46.606 --> 01:47.607
Dad!

01:47.982 --> 01:50.944
Think you have
room in that box
for one more Valentine?

01:51.528 --> 01:52.946
[gasps] I love it.

01:53.029 --> 01:55.532
Happy Valentine's Day,
Lovebug.

01:55.949 --> 01:58.118
I'm gonna call her Val.

01:58.201 --> 02:00.620
Val for Valentine.

02:01.037 --> 02:03.123
I can't wait to
show my friends.

02:07.377 --> 02:09.169
Oh! Thanks.

02:21.599 --> 02:24.853
Where's my Valentine hug?

02:24.936 --> 02:28.148
[laughs]
I can't wait for you
to meet my friends, Val.

02:28.231 --> 02:30.066
They're gonna love you.

02:30.483 --> 02:32.902
Shh! Let's surprise them.

02:33.653 --> 02:35.488
The Doc is in.

02:37.782 --> 02:40.160
[Lambie] A little
to the left, Chilly.

02:40.577 --> 02:41.578
That's perfect.

02:41.953 --> 02:44.330
Now all we need
to start the party is Doc.

02:44.414 --> 02:46.749
[Doc] Did somebody
say "party"?

02:46.833 --> 02:47.750
Hey, Doc.

02:47.834 --> 02:48.793
[Chilly] Hi there, Doc.

02:49.669 --> 02:51.671
Happy Valentine's Day.

02:52.088 --> 02:54.382
Wow. You did it again, Lambie.

02:54.465 --> 02:58.094
The clinic looks
even more amazing
than last Valentine's Day.

02:58.469 --> 03:01.139
Oh, thanks.
I just can't help myself.

03:01.472 --> 03:05.143
Valentine's Day
is my favorite day
of the whole year.

03:05.560 --> 03:07.729
Just wait until you see
what I have planned

03:07.812 --> 03:09.105
for our Valentine's party.

03:09.564 --> 03:14.485
Can't wait, but first,
I have a surprise
for everyone.

03:14.569 --> 03:17.363
[gasps]
A Valentine's surprise?

03:17.447 --> 03:18.948
You guessed it.

03:19.032 --> 03:22.660
Happy Valentine's Day.

03:23.077 --> 03:25.496
Everyone, this is Val.

03:25.830 --> 03:27.999
Val, this is everyone.

03:28.082 --> 03:29.459
[all exclaiming]

03:29.918 --> 03:32.670
Oh! This heart
could just burst

03:32.754 --> 03:34.672
with all the love
in this room.

03:35.173 --> 03:37.342
Oh, is that
what's wrong with you?

03:37.425 --> 03:39.552
Because you don't
look broken.

03:40.011 --> 03:41.387
Why is she here, Doc?

03:41.763 --> 03:43.806
Val is not here for
a check-up, Lambie.

03:43.890 --> 03:46.309
She's my new
Valentine's Day toy.

03:46.726 --> 03:48.978
Love your party, Lambie,

03:49.062 --> 03:52.398
but then I love
everything about
Valentine's Day

03:52.482 --> 03:57.195
because I'm a Valentine
and it's my day.
[laughs]

03:57.904 --> 04:00.490
But it's supposed
to be my day.

04:00.865 --> 04:02.492
Be still, my heart.

04:02.575 --> 04:04.661
Would you look at
those decorations?

04:05.036 --> 04:06.621
Fabulous!

04:06.704 --> 04:07.747
[Stuffy] Smile, Lambie.

04:08.081 --> 04:10.416
Time for this year's
Valentine's Day
party picture.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.627
Our usual pose?

04:12.710 --> 04:13.920
Oh, yeah.

04:14.003 --> 04:16.255
Now say, "Valentine."

04:16.714 --> 04:18.048
[both] Valentine.

04:18.298 --> 04:20.009
[squeals] Oh...

04:20.426 --> 04:23.763
Stuffy, you were holding
the camera the wrong way.

04:24.138 --> 04:25.139
Try it again.

04:25.515 --> 04:27.892
Oops! [laughs]
Okay.

04:28.977 --> 04:30.770
Valentine.

04:33.439 --> 04:34.691
Thanks, Stuffy.

04:40.029 --> 04:43.574
[Lambie] Oh... It was supposed
to be just me and Doc.

04:44.575 --> 04:46.869
[Doc] Lambie,
is everything okay?

04:47.620 --> 04:48.913
Oh... Yeah.

04:49.330 --> 04:52.208
Doc, I have something
really special to show you.

04:52.750 --> 04:56.129
It's my super special
Valentine's Day--

04:56.212 --> 04:59.132
Step on up and get a cuddle.

04:59.215 --> 05:00.216
Cuddle booth?

05:00.300 --> 05:02.635
[huffs] What's she doing
in there?

05:02.719 --> 05:04.053
Mmm! Ah!

05:04.137 --> 05:06.097
Now, that's a good hug.

05:06.180 --> 05:07.765
Give me some sugar.

05:08.099 --> 05:09.517
You should try it, Lambie.

05:09.600 --> 05:11.477
[Hallie] Mmm-mmm!

05:11.894 --> 05:15.315
That's the heartiest
hug I ever had. Get it?

05:15.690 --> 05:19.944
Hey, I'm the one
who gives out the hugs
around here, not Val.

05:20.194 --> 05:22.822
It's okay, Lambie.
Val is new here.

05:23.114 --> 05:24.657
She's just being friendly.

05:25.700 --> 05:28.453
Hey there, snowman.

05:28.536 --> 05:30.747
You look like you
could use a cuddle.

05:31.456 --> 05:33.666
[gasps] That's my line.

05:34.167 --> 05:36.252
[gasps] No! No hugs for me.

05:36.335 --> 05:38.254
Snowmen fall apart
if you squeeze them.

05:38.629 --> 05:41.507
Chilly, you're not
really made of snow,
remember.

05:41.591 --> 05:42.508
You're stuffed.

05:42.925 --> 05:46.804
Oh! Uh, in that case,
bring it on.

05:46.888 --> 05:47.805
[thuds]
Oh!

05:47.889 --> 05:49.140
[all laughing]

05:49.640 --> 05:51.768
Ahem! Okay, everybody.

05:51.851 --> 05:54.729
It's time for
Pin The Heart On Me.

05:54.812 --> 05:56.481
Oh, I love this game.

05:57.356 --> 05:59.317
This is how
the dragon does it.

05:59.400 --> 06:02.028
Let me cover your eyes
so I can spin you.

06:03.654 --> 06:05.823

06:08.367 --> 06:10.620

06:10.703 --> 06:12.413
[Doc] Here you go, Stuffy.

06:14.290 --> 06:15.583
I'm over here.

06:16.167 --> 06:18.544
Whoa... Whoa... Whoa!

06:18.628 --> 06:19.629
[laughs]

06:20.254 --> 06:23.007
[laughs] Oops.
Definitely not the lamb.

06:23.091 --> 06:25.468
Not even close, Stuffy.

06:25.802 --> 06:29.472
Look at that.
A heart for the heart.

06:36.979 --> 06:38.940
Who wants
to make Valentines?

06:39.273 --> 06:40.858
-[Val] I love making Valentines.
-[Stuffy] Let's do it.

06:40.942 --> 06:41.943
[Chilly] I do!

06:42.026 --> 06:43.778
[Doc] I'll get stuff
to make cards.

06:44.362 --> 06:47.198
[all exclaiming]

06:47.824 --> 06:49.283
[Val] I'm gonna draw a heart.

06:49.367 --> 06:51.369
-[Chilly] Pass me the sparkles.
-[Lambie] More glitter!

06:51.953 --> 06:54.247
Everyone loves
my Valentines.

06:54.622 --> 06:58.126
Oh, and this is gonna be
my best Valentine card ever.

06:58.626 --> 07:00.002
Someone pass the sparkles.

07:00.419 --> 07:01.420

07:02.088 --> 07:03.089
[grunts]

07:04.465 --> 07:05.466
[Hallie] Uh-huh!

07:05.550 --> 07:08.719
There's a whole lot
of Hallie love in
this card, little fish.

07:08.803 --> 07:09.804
[Squeakers squeaks]

07:10.221 --> 07:13.141
Oopsy daisy.
Sorry about that.

07:13.224 --> 07:14.183
[laughs]

07:14.267 --> 07:16.227
Bet you never had
a "Dragontine" before, Doc.

07:16.310 --> 07:20.064
Get it? "Dragontine?"
Valentine?

07:20.148 --> 07:22.024
Ah! I'm your Valentine.

07:22.108 --> 07:24.318
[giggles] Thanks, Stuffy.

07:24.402 --> 07:28.197
You're the best
"Dragontine" I ever got.

07:28.739 --> 07:30.074
"Dragontine," huh?

07:30.158 --> 07:31.951
Just watch what
the lamb can do.

07:32.034 --> 07:33.744
Doc is gonna love this.

07:34.162 --> 07:37.165
Just a little
something from my heart.

07:37.248 --> 07:38.374
[all gasping]

07:38.458 --> 07:39.917
[Chilly] Take a look at that!

07:40.293 --> 07:42.128
That's beautiful, Val.

07:42.211 --> 07:44.505
I've never seen
anything like it.

07:47.800 --> 07:48.926
[sobs]

07:50.511 --> 07:51.846
Huh? [gasps]

07:51.929 --> 07:55.892
Oh, no!
Doc, I think I just
caught sparkly-itis.

07:56.142 --> 07:57.643
It's okay, Chilly.

07:57.727 --> 07:59.604
Some sparkles
just fell on you.

07:59.687 --> 08:02.231
They come right off.

[Chilly] That was great.

08:52.615 --> 08:54.408
Did you wanna show me
something, Lambie?

08:55.535 --> 08:58.371
No, no.
[sighs] It's nothing.

09:01.332 --> 09:02.708
You okay, Lambie?

09:03.334 --> 09:05.086

09:05.503 --> 09:08.172
Well, you don't seem fine.

09:08.631 --> 09:11.342
I'd like to give you
a check-up just to be safe.

09:11.425 --> 09:13.594
But aren't you
too busy with Val?

09:13.928 --> 09:15.471
Of course not.

09:15.555 --> 09:17.765
What's more important
than helping a friend?

09:21.227 --> 09:23.229
Hmm... Nothing in your ears.

09:23.312 --> 09:24.689
Let's check your eyes.

09:30.152 --> 09:32.989
Is that a tear in your eye?

09:33.364 --> 09:35.366
Does something hurt?

09:35.825 --> 09:38.411
Just... [sniffles]
Just my heart.

09:38.661 --> 09:41.956
It hurts a little,
but don't worry about me.

09:42.498 --> 09:45.543
I'm sure you'd
rather be at the party
with Val, anyway.

09:46.002 --> 09:50.298
Lambie, do you
really think I'd rather be
with Val than with you?

09:50.631 --> 09:54.218
I was your number-one cuddler,
your best friend.

09:54.302 --> 09:56.679
[sobbing]
Valentine's Day was my day...

09:57.138 --> 09:59.724
and now you have Val,
and she's perfect,

10:00.391 --> 10:03.185
and everyone
thinks she cuddles

20:36.360 --> 20:37.444
Hi, Mom.

20:37.945 --> 20:39.571
Hi, Doc.
What's going on?

20:39.905 --> 20:42.199
I have a patient
who needs a good wash.

20:42.616 --> 20:45.911
Oh, Teddy B.
What's your diagnosis?

20:45.994 --> 20:49.706
I think he's got
the dusty-musties.

20:51.041 --> 20:53.502
I second your diagnosis,
and you're right.

20:53.585 --> 20:56.255
A good wash
is just what this bear needs.

21:01.885 --> 21:03.553
Oops, we're out of soap.

21:03.637 --> 21:05.055
I'll be right back.

21:09.768 --> 21:11.019
You ready for this?

21:11.353 --> 21:13.981
I'll do anything to
be with Donny again,

21:14.564 --> 21:17.109
but I am a little scared.

21:17.442 --> 21:19.111
What if we go with you?

21:19.403 --> 21:20.529
Can we, Doc?

21:20.737 --> 21:23.490
Well, you both
can use a wash.

21:24.616 --> 21:25.951
You'd do that for me?

21:26.034 --> 21:27.619
Sure.
Of course, Teddy.

21:27.911 --> 21:29.496
Then I'm ready.

21:29.705 --> 21:30.664
[Mom] Got the soap.

21:31.164 --> 21:32.291
Oh, good.

21:32.374 --> 21:34.793
I think I'll wash
Stuffy and Lambie
while we're at it.

21:35.085 --> 21:36.003
Sounds good.

21:43.719 --> 21:46.847
There.
These guys will be clean
in no time at all.

21:47.180 --> 21:48.265
Thanks, Mom.

21:55.397 --> 21:57.024
Doc, your patient is ready.

21:57.983 --> 21:59.359
Oh, great. Thanks.

22:07.367 --> 22:09.161
Now, that was refreshing.

22:09.244 --> 22:12.039
Ah! I've never felt so clean.

22:12.497 --> 22:13.790
Where's Teddy B?

22:14.207 --> 22:16.918
Hah! That was fun,
and look at me.

22:17.002 --> 22:19.796
I'm clean. I'm clean.
No dust.

22:20.047 --> 22:21.840
Are you ready to see Donny?

22:22.299 --> 22:26.553
Oh, boy, am I, but first,
I got to thank you guys.

22:26.762 --> 22:29.222
I can't believe
all you did for me.

22:29.681 --> 22:31.308
Helping toys is what I do.

22:31.808 --> 22:34.436
And no one wants to see
a toy lose his kid.

22:34.811 --> 22:36.772
Or a kid lose their toy.

22:37.939 --> 22:39.066
[laughing]

22:42.069 --> 22:44.154
Donny, I have
something for you.

22:45.072 --> 22:46.656
Teddy? But I...
No.

22:46.948 --> 22:48.158
He won't
make you sneeze.

22:48.575 --> 22:50.285
-He won't?
-Nope.

22:50.702 --> 22:53.622
He had the dusty-musties,
but I cured him.

22:53.914 --> 22:56.083
Go on. You can hold him.

23:02.923 --> 23:05.425
Teddy! I'm not sneezing.

23:05.801 --> 23:06.676
I know,

23:06.760 --> 23:09.304
and if he ever
makes you sneeze again,

23:09.638 --> 23:12.682
he just needs a wash,
and he'll be all better.

23:13.517 --> 23:16.436
Teddy, I missed you,

23:18.063 --> 23:21.024
and I'm never gonna
let you go again ever.

23:21.441 --> 23:22.651
Thanks, Doc.

23:23.068 --> 23:24.194
You're welcome.

23:24.653 --> 23:26.154
That's what toy doctors,

23:26.655 --> 23:28.365
and big sisters are for.

23:29.157 --> 23:30.492
[both laughing]

23:32.911 --> 23:34.913
Hey, everybody, it's Doc here.

23:34.996 --> 23:36.998
<span style="style.default_1">Luca got a splinter</span>
<span style="style.default_1">in his finger.</span>

23:37.415 --> 23:39.918
<span style="style.default_1">What should you do</span>
<span style="style.default_1">if you get a splinter?</span>

23:40.544 --> 23:43.797
<span style="style.default_1">Should you play dragon stomp</span>
<span style="style.default_1">and knock down all your blocks?</span>

23:46.299 --> 23:48.969
<span style="style.default_1">Should you tell an adult</span>
<span style="style.default_1">so they can remove the splinter?</span>

23:50.220 --> 23:53.140
<span style="style.default_1">Should you play a game</span>
<span style="style.default_1">of throw cotton balls</span>
<span style="style.default_1">at Stuffy's tummy?</span>

23:55.142 --> 23:58.353
<span style="style.default_1">That's right!</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Get an adult to</span>
<span style="style.default_1">remove the splinter.</span>
