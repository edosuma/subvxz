Hannah?

00:59.121 --> 01:00.862
Thank you.

01:00.905 --> 01:03.065
Nothing like a homicide to
kick-start the evening, huh?

01:03.081 --> 01:04.779
Who's our victim?

01:04.822 --> 01:07.216
Captain John Garrett,
25 years, JAG Corps.

01:07.760 --> 01:09.000
Still active duty?

01:09.044 --> 01:10.219
Yeah, military judge.

01:10.263 --> 01:11.351
Daughter found the body.

01:11.394 --> 01:12.395
She hurt?

01:12.439 --> 01:14.005
No, she's just in shock.

01:14.049 --> 01:16.094
She's with an officer inside.

01:16.138 --> 01:18.227
Loretta and Sebastian here?

01:18.271 --> 01:20.055
Loretta and Tammy.

01:20.098 --> 01:22.884
Sebastian's in REACT
training in Florida.

01:22.927 --> 01:24.625
Right, yeah. Yeah.

01:24.668 --> 01:26.583
Yeah, we could use a forensics expert.

01:26.627 --> 01:30.500
The crime scene's... it's not pretty.

01:33.199 --> 01:35.375
The preliminary cause of death appears

01:35.418 --> 01:37.203
to be blunt force trauma to the head.

01:37.246 --> 01:40.249
And based on injuries and blood spatter,

01:40.293 --> 01:41.816
it appears the body was moved.

01:41.859 --> 01:43.779
Seems like his daughter
was trying to revive him.

01:43.822 --> 01:46.216
Well, there's no weapon, either,
unless it's under the body.

01:46.259 --> 01:48.823
Uh, you shouldn't be doing that.

01:48.866 --> 01:50.651
You're going to contaminate
my crime scene.

01:50.694 --> 01:52.348
- Your crime scene?
- Uh...

01:52.392 --> 01:56.222
Heather Daniels, NCIS
Agent Tammy Gregorio.

01:56.265 --> 01:57.571
Heather's my intern.

01:57.614 --> 01:59.268
Uh, she's a student
from John Jay College

01:59.312 --> 02:01.227
of Criminal Justice.

02:01.270 --> 02:02.315
Oh, what's up?

02:02.358 --> 02:03.968
My master's is in forensic science.

02:04.012 --> 02:06.275
Now, I'm going for my
PhD in criminal justice.

02:06.319 --> 02:07.929
Cool. Knock yourself out.

02:07.972 --> 02:11.106
As I was saying, protocol
requires law enforcement

02:11.149 --> 02:12.977
to consult with the
onsite medical examiner

02:13.021 --> 02:14.283
before adding a foreign object

02:14.327 --> 02:16.285
to the scene, which you failed to do.

02:16.329 --> 02:18.853
Brooklyn, meet Manhattan.

02:27.753 --> 02:31.353
He's dead... isn't he?

02:31.996 --> 02:33.998
I tried to revive him.

02:34.042 --> 02:36.784
I'm so sorry.

02:36.827 --> 02:38.699
I'm Special Agent Pride.

02:39.242 --> 02:41.832
Understand how hard this
is, but we need to ask you

02:41.876 --> 02:44.444
a few questions if you're up to it.

02:46.272 --> 02:49.187
Whatever I can do.

02:49.231 --> 02:52.234
You're the one that found your father?

02:52.278 --> 02:54.018
Yeah.

02:54.062 --> 02:55.542
Can you tell us about it?

02:55.585 --> 02:59.502
I just remember seeing
someone on the floor.

02:59.546 --> 03:01.374
I didn't think it was him.

03:01.417 --> 03:03.941
He looked so small and...

03:03.985 --> 03:06.248
then I flipped him over and...

03:06.292 --> 03:08.250
he wasn't breathing and...

03:08.294 --> 03:09.654
I tried CPR, but that didn't work.

03:09.686 --> 03:12.080
And I couldn't find a pulse.

03:12.123 --> 03:13.603
No matter what I did and...

03:13.645 --> 03:15.125
then there was this dog, and, like...

03:15.126 --> 03:16.519
The dog was from a neighbor

03:16.563 --> 03:18.260
a couple blocks up.

03:18.304 --> 03:20.344
I knew something wasn't
right the minute I got home.

03:20.345 --> 03:22.395
I wondered why the door was open.

03:22.438 --> 03:24.875
Can you think of anyone

03:24.881 --> 03:26.441
who might have issues with your father?

03:26.442 --> 03:27.617
No.

03:27.661 --> 03:29.706
All I can think about is...

03:29.750 --> 03:31.317
the blood.

03:31.360 --> 03:33.144
You know?

03:33.188 --> 03:35.364
I tried calling 911, but...

03:35.408 --> 03:37.323
my hands...

03:37.366 --> 03:38.411
the-the blood.

03:38.454 --> 03:40.369
- I couldn't dial.
- Selina...

03:40.413 --> 03:42.453
And then I moved to the
landline, and then that fell

03:42.458 --> 03:44.373
off of the desk, and I couldn't...

03:44.417 --> 03:46.017
There was just so much blood...

03:46.027 --> 03:47.289
Okay.

03:47.333 --> 03:49.378
That's good for now.

03:49.422 --> 03:51.206
Let's take a break, huh?

03:51.249 --> 03:54.383
We'll get someone to get you cleaned up.

03:54.427 --> 03:57.386
Please.

03:57.430 --> 04:00.346
Please find the person
who did this to my father.

04:06.371 --> 04:08.771
_

04:14.229 --> 04:17.274
So, uh, judging by the
chatter in the room,

04:17.319 --> 04:19.755
sounds like the first drill is
gonna be a search and rescue.

04:19.800 --> 04:21.671
I got some tactics in mind.

04:21.714 --> 04:23.412
Hey. Hey, guys, sorry, uh...

04:23.456 --> 04:25.675
I'm Sebastian Lund, out of New Orleans.

04:25.719 --> 04:27.547
I did not realize that I was late.

04:27.590 --> 04:29.418
You're not late.

04:29.462 --> 04:30.767
Everyone else is early.

04:30.811 --> 04:32.203
Right.

04:32.247 --> 04:33.770
Rhonda, Detroit.

04:33.814 --> 04:35.859
- That's Quynh.
- Los Angeles.

04:35.903 --> 04:37.426
- Nice.
- Gus.

04:37.470 --> 04:38.993
Former Marine from Louisville.

04:39.036 --> 04:40.995
Cool. Well, it's great to meet you guys.

04:41.038 --> 04:42.678
I'm really looking
forward to the whole...

04:42.679 --> 04:43.898
Good morning, recruits.

04:45.478 --> 04:46.478
I'm Commander Taylor.

04:46.479 --> 04:48.916
Welcome to NCIS REACT Training.

04:48.959 --> 04:51.440
While you're here,
your team will compete

04:51.484 --> 04:53.007
in a series of tactical drills.

04:53.050 --> 04:55.618
Victory is earned on the
strength of teamwork.

04:55.662 --> 04:57.228
If one of you fails,

04:57.272 --> 04:58.839
you all fail.

05:00.362 --> 05:02.364
As for choosing team leaders.

05:07.238 --> 05:10.328
This is not a democracy.

05:11.329 --> 05:14.420
Short straw takes the lead.

05:26.475 --> 05:29.957
Congratulations, Agent Lund.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.959
Your team is counting on you.

05:41.011 --> 05:42.926
What have we learned
about Captain Garrett?

05:42.970 --> 05:44.319
He's a JAG Corps judge.

05:44.362 --> 05:47.278
Presided over nearly a
thousand military trials

05:47.322 --> 05:49.629
and responsible for
hundreds of dishonorable

05:49.672 --> 05:51.065
discharges.

05:51.108 --> 05:52.708
That is a hell of a suspect pool.

05:52.751 --> 05:54.231
- Anybody pop?
- An anonymous anybody

05:54.275 --> 05:56.810
sent Garrett a series of death threats.

05:56.853 --> 05:58.464
- 15 in total.
- When were they sent?

05:58.507 --> 06:00.857
The first 12 were sent
over a six-month period

06:00.901 --> 06:03.251
five years back, but then they stopped.

06:03.294 --> 06:05.383
As of a few months ago,
they started up again.

06:05.427 --> 06:07.168
Oh, that is a long
time to hold a grudge.

06:07.211 --> 06:09.518
- Yeah.
- Yeah, we'll need to comb through

06:09.562 --> 06:12.303
five years' worth of Garrett's cases.

06:12.347 --> 06:14.392
Patton's cross-checking
identifying details

06:14.436 --> 06:16.525
of every felon Garrett sent away.

06:16.569 --> 06:18.048
And we got four viable hits.

06:18.092 --> 06:19.485
Three are still incarcerated.

06:19.528 --> 06:21.748
That leaves one suspect... Who is it?

06:23.489 --> 06:24.707
Lawrence Chastang.

06:24.751 --> 06:26.317
Served five years for an assault.

06:26.361 --> 06:27.405
Paroled last month.

06:27.449 --> 06:28.668
Listen to this.

06:28.711 --> 06:29.843
"You ruined my life

06:29.886 --> 06:31.279
"and took everything from me.

06:31.322 --> 06:32.367
"I'm patient.

06:32.410 --> 06:34.761
I will complete my mission".

06:34.804 --> 06:35.979
And this one.

06:36.023 --> 06:38.547
"Nobody you love is safe.

06:38.591 --> 06:41.376
"They'll pay just like you.
You have only yourself

06:41.419 --> 06:43.160
to blame for what's
about to happen next".

06:43.204 --> 06:45.293
This was six weeks ago.

06:45.336 --> 06:46.990
Not just threatening Captain Garrett.

06:47.034 --> 06:48.383
Threatening his family, too.

06:48.426 --> 06:49.645
Garrett's only

06:49.689 --> 06:50.994
immediate family is Selina.

06:51.038 --> 06:53.431
If Chastang is serious, she's in danger.

06:53.475 --> 06:55.172
We need a location on Chastang.

06:56.522 --> 06:57.740
Pinged his cell phone.

06:57.784 --> 06:59.394
Intersection of Royal and St. Philip

06:59.437 --> 07:01.178
- in the Quarter.
- All right, let's go.

07:01.222 --> 07:03.572
Location's not exact.

07:03.616 --> 07:05.274
You're gonna have to look for it.

07:13.277 --> 07:14.452
That's Chastang's car.

07:29.555 --> 07:32.079
What I'm seeing looks
like blood on the trunk.

07:32.122 --> 07:34.342
Sounds like probable cause to me.

07:49.923 --> 07:52.055
I got a bloody tire iron.

07:52.099 --> 07:53.622
This is his car. You got eyes on him?

07:54.866 --> 07:56.330
Wait.

07:56.373 --> 07:58.279
Selina Garrett's inside.

07:58.322 --> 07:59.933
- What?
- She's in the back.

07:59.976 --> 08:02.936
- At a table.
- What about Chastang?

08:04.633 --> 08:05.634
Yeah, I got him.

08:05.678 --> 08:06.766
He's headed right for her.

08:09.551 --> 08:11.369
- Lawrence Chastang!
- Whoa, whoa!

08:11.371 --> 08:13.249
Federal agents! Get your hands up! NCIS!

08:13.250 --> 08:15.425
- Everybody, just stay calm.
- I'm just getting coffee, all right?

08:15.426 --> 08:16.644
- I'm just here for coffee!
- On the ground!

08:16.645 --> 08:18.485
- Easy! Put it down!
- This is a mistake, okay?

08:18.486 --> 08:20.406
- Come on, on the ground.
- I didn't do anything.

08:20.407 --> 08:22.907
- On the ground, all the way down.
- Please, this is a mistake.

08:22.909 --> 08:25.563
Come on!

08:25.607 --> 08:27.447
- What's going on here?
- Come with me, Selina.

08:27.448 --> 08:28.523
Who is that man?

08:28.666 --> 08:30.665
Is he... is that the man
who killed my father?

08:30.708 --> 08:33.720
- Let's just leave.
- No. Why is he here?

08:33.763 --> 08:35.363
Please, Selina. Selina, please...

08:35.364 --> 08:37.197
He wants to hurt me?

08:37.840 --> 08:39.576
No one's gonna hurt you, I promise.

08:48.503 --> 08:50.984
Lawrence, don't waste our time.

08:51.027 --> 08:52.612
I'm telling you, I didn't kill anybody.

08:52.655 --> 08:54.813
You just keep other people's
bloody tire irons in your trunk?

08:54.814 --> 08:56.250
I don't know how that got in there!

08:56.293 --> 08:58.295
The murder weapon that
killed Captain Garrett

08:58.339 --> 09:00.863
just magically wound up in your car?

09:00.907 --> 09:04.171
And you just magically appear at the
same coffee shop as his daughter?

09:04.173 --> 09:06.053
Because I'm there a few
times a week, all right?

09:06.054 --> 09:07.596
I go there to check out job listings.

09:07.640 --> 09:09.218
Yeah, that's a hell of a coincidence...

09:09.219 --> 09:11.219
you and the daughter of
the man who put you in jail

09:11.221 --> 09:13.354
all in the same place right
after you kill her father.

09:13.397 --> 09:15.312
I didn't kill Captain Garrett.

09:15.316 --> 09:16.796
I didn't even know he had a daughter.

09:16.797 --> 09:17.967
Oh!

09:18.011 --> 09:20.578
Now, that's a lie.

09:20.622 --> 09:23.625
See, because you
threatened his whole family

09:23.669 --> 09:24.931
in writing.

09:28.935 --> 09:30.240
Where'd you get these?

09:30.284 --> 09:31.807
From the dead man's house.

09:31.851 --> 09:33.548
And we know that you wrote them.

09:33.591 --> 09:35.158
Okay, I wrote them. Okay?

09:35.202 --> 09:36.725
I was angry. All right?

09:36.769 --> 09:38.640
First year locked up, I
was blaming everybody.

09:38.684 --> 09:39.720
I had rage issues.

09:39.763 --> 09:41.773
Especially at the man who
sentenced you to prison.

09:41.774 --> 09:43.654
You mention in those
letters about a dozen times

09:43.655 --> 09:45.386
how you planned to kill him.

09:45.429 --> 09:48.389
I'm only as sick as my secrets.

09:50.391 --> 09:51.448
I was an addict.

09:51.492 --> 09:53.786
Okay? But I'm in recovery now.

09:53.829 --> 09:55.352
It took me years to own my actions,

09:55.396 --> 09:56.919
to realize I'm responsible

09:56.963 --> 09:58.007
for the pain I cause.

09:58.051 --> 09:59.269
No one else.

09:59.313 --> 10:00.793
Okay, then come clean, Lawrence.

10:00.836 --> 10:02.185
Own up to what you did.

10:02.229 --> 10:03.317
I'm owning it, okay?

10:03.360 --> 10:04.535
I wrote the letters.

10:04.579 --> 10:05.754
But that's it.

10:05.798 --> 10:07.408
My girlfriend mailed them for me.

10:07.411 --> 10:09.011
We know that you sent the letters, okay?

10:09.012 --> 10:10.933
The question is, what
did you do last night?

10:12.848 --> 10:16.069
If I would've been released back then...

10:16.112 --> 10:17.679
okay, maybe,

10:17.723 --> 10:19.768
maybe I would've done
something to hurt him.

10:19.812 --> 10:23.163
But I am no longer the man
who wrote these letters.

10:23.206 --> 10:24.381
So what happened?

10:24.425 --> 10:26.427
The new you fall off the revenge wagon?

10:26.470 --> 10:27.645
What are these?

10:27.689 --> 10:30.997
These letters were
written three months ago.

10:32.259 --> 10:34.478
I-I didn't write these.

10:34.522 --> 10:35.958
Same wording.

10:36.002 --> 10:38.265
Same turn of phrase.
Same grammar mistakes.

10:38.308 --> 10:40.167
I... I-I didn't write these.

10:40.210 --> 10:41.976
Your little redemption
tale notwithstanding,

10:41.977 --> 10:43.836
all the evidence points
to you as the murderer.

10:43.879 --> 10:45.011
You're going back to prison.

10:49.145 --> 10:51.225
So, it looks like a
capture the flag mission.

10:51.226 --> 10:54.237
We all have to go in, and
we all have to come out

10:54.281 --> 10:55.325
with the flag.

10:55.369 --> 10:56.426
Teams are gonna be ranked

10:56.470 --> 10:57.980
according to how quickly we finish.

10:58.024 --> 10:59.982
Right. Thanks for summing
up everything, Rhonda.

11:00.026 --> 11:01.375
Um, so, I-I've got a strategy.

11:01.418 --> 11:03.594
We go in hard, and we fan out.

11:03.638 --> 11:05.422
That's-that's one way to go.

11:05.466 --> 11:07.207
Definitely, yeah. Um, I was thinking

11:07.250 --> 11:09.022
something just-just a
little different, okay?

11:09.065 --> 11:11.305
So, we've been given this wide
array of equipment, right?

11:11.306 --> 11:13.430
There's four of everything.
But if we work in teams,

11:13.474 --> 11:15.634
then there are certain things,
like, uh, like the rope,

11:15.635 --> 11:17.086
the Maglites, that a team can share.

11:17.130 --> 11:18.522
Part of this challenge

11:18.566 --> 11:20.002
is knowing what to leave behind.

11:20.046 --> 11:21.961
Well, my strategy allows us

11:22.004 --> 11:23.604
to cut down what each person is carrying

11:23.614 --> 11:25.695
by nearly 40% and still
taking everything in.

11:25.739 --> 11:27.543
- We don't need all of that.
- Well,

11:27.544 --> 11:29.403
I mean, you never know
what you're gonna need.

11:29.446 --> 11:31.966
- Right? That's my point.
- It's inefficient, and it's wasteful,

11:31.967 --> 11:33.842
which is my point. Who's with me?

11:33.886 --> 11:36.889
This is not a democracy,
remember? I'm team leader.

11:36.932 --> 11:38.934
I didn't come here to lose.

11:43.678 --> 11:45.462
What can you tell us, Loretta?

11:45.506 --> 11:48.378
Ah, the preliminary
finding was accurate.

11:48.422 --> 11:50.816
C.O.D. is blunt force trauma to the head

11:50.859 --> 11:52.426
caused by some sort of bludgeon.

11:52.469 --> 11:53.819
Tire iron, for instance?

11:53.862 --> 11:56.386
That's consistent. And the
blood and tissue samples

11:56.430 --> 11:59.259
taken from your tire
iron matches the victim.

11:59.302 --> 12:00.862
Though there were no fingerprints found

12:00.869 --> 12:03.263
- on the weapon.
- Yeah, that's not a problem.

12:03.306 --> 12:04.438
What do you mean by that?

12:04.481 --> 12:06.309
I mean Chastang might
have wiped it clean,

12:06.353 --> 12:07.615
or he wore gloves.

12:07.658 --> 12:09.498
You're saying he wiped
it clean of fingerprints

12:09.499 --> 12:11.010
but left it dripping with blood?

12:11.053 --> 12:14.317
Or... he wore... gloves.

12:14.361 --> 12:17.059
There are potential inconsistencies.

12:17.103 --> 12:19.663
Well, we found the murder weapon
in his car. That and the letters

12:19.706 --> 12:21.506
are more than enough
to tie him to the murder.

12:21.507 --> 12:22.630
Textbook.

12:22.673 --> 12:24.937
Yeah, exactly. He's our killer.

12:24.980 --> 12:27.678
No. I mean, you're displaying
textbook confirmation bias.

12:27.722 --> 12:30.856
I've read about it.
Amazing to see it in action.

12:30.899 --> 12:32.099
All right, then. That's, uh...

12:32.101 --> 12:33.701
Um, shouldn't she be seen and not heard?

12:33.702 --> 12:35.251
Tammy, she's my intern,

12:35.295 --> 12:37.036
not my 19th century orphan.

12:37.079 --> 12:38.733
Dr. Wade hasn't even finished

12:38.776 --> 12:40.561
presenting, and you've
already got a suspect

12:40.604 --> 12:42.650
doing 25 to life based on
your preexisting theory.

12:42.693 --> 12:43.869
Let's just save

12:43.912 --> 12:46.741
this debate until after
Loretta's finished.

12:46.784 --> 12:48.438
Good idea. Okay.

12:48.482 --> 12:51.050
Now, the blood spatter pattern

12:51.093 --> 12:54.183
indicates that the assailant
was behind the victim

12:54.227 --> 12:56.403
when he struck him in
the back of the head,

12:56.446 --> 12:58.361
and the second blow was
to the side of the head.

12:58.405 --> 13:01.408
So Garrett was turning
to look at his attacker?

13:01.451 --> 13:03.366
Trying to, but the second blow

13:03.410 --> 13:05.586
caused him to fall to
the ground face-first.

13:05.629 --> 13:07.544
The death threats
sent to Captain Garrett

13:07.588 --> 13:09.372
suggest revenge-seeking behavior.

13:09.416 --> 13:12.419
But revenge seekers tend to
want to face their victims.

13:12.462 --> 13:13.550
So, you're a profiler now?

13:13.594 --> 13:14.987
Well, am I wrong?

13:15.030 --> 13:16.379
No, let me tell you what you are.

13:16.423 --> 13:18.816
- We're done here. Thank you, Loretta.
- Thank you.

13:18.860 --> 13:21.428
- Is she okay?
- Yeah, she's fine.

13:21.471 --> 13:22.690
What was that about?

13:22.733 --> 13:24.910
Trying to teach this
millennial some respect.

13:24.953 --> 13:26.912
Yeah, well, she's precocious, sure.

13:26.955 --> 13:29.262
But you are a profiler.

13:29.305 --> 13:31.264
What would you say about the person

13:31.267 --> 13:32.627
who sent those letters to Garrett?

13:32.628 --> 13:33.919
He's a revenge seeker.

13:33.962 --> 13:35.802
There's no way he attacked
Garrett from behind.

13:35.833 --> 13:38.184
He'd want to know that he
was the last face Garrett saw.

13:38.227 --> 13:39.968
Right. And Chastang admitted

13:40.012 --> 13:41.970
that he wrote the earlier letters

13:42.014 --> 13:43.493
even though we couldn't prove it.

13:43.537 --> 13:46.235
- Not a good idea if he killed Garrett.
- Right.

13:46.279 --> 13:49.673
So Heather's not wrong.
Chastang doesn't quite fit.

13:49.717 --> 13:52.285
Of course she's not wrong,
but I'm not gonna tell her that.

13:52.328 --> 13:55.114
Let's go kick the tires on our case.

13:55.157 --> 13:56.879
- Our case.
- I-I-I hear you.

13:56.881 --> 13:58.683
I understand what you're saying.

14:01.555 --> 14:03.513
- Thank you. Yeah. Hey.
- Hey.

14:03.557 --> 14:05.820
Everybody who worked at
the coffee shop confirmed

14:05.863 --> 14:07.783
that Chastang was there
a couple of times a week,

14:07.784 --> 14:10.085
so he was telling the truth about that.

14:10.129 --> 14:11.849
- Doesn't mean he didn't kill Garrett.
- No,

14:11.869 --> 14:14.524
but forensic analysis of
the letters is inconclusive.

14:14.568 --> 14:17.788
Both paper and ink generic
enough to be widely available.

14:17.832 --> 14:20.313
What did Chastang's girlfriend
say about mailing the letters?

14:20.356 --> 14:22.315
She totally backs his story.

14:22.358 --> 14:23.464
She took those letters,

14:23.507 --> 14:24.969
mailed them a couple of years back,

14:24.970 --> 14:26.580
but they broke up
before he was released.

14:26.623 --> 14:28.582
That doesn't help us
with the recent letters.

14:28.625 --> 14:30.584
- I talked to the parole officer.
- Mm-hmm.

14:30.627 --> 14:32.803
He said Chastang turned
his life around in prison.

14:32.847 --> 14:34.414
Said it wasn't an act.

14:34.457 --> 14:36.590
None of this moves the
needle. There's plenty

14:36.633 --> 14:38.026
of evidence to charge Chastang.

14:38.070 --> 14:39.506
It just doesn't fit.

14:39.549 --> 14:41.551
Revenge killers are hot.

14:41.555 --> 14:43.075
Chastang may have been five years ago,

14:43.076 --> 14:45.033
- but now I'm not so sure.
- Okay.

14:45.077 --> 14:46.730
Devil's advocate. If it's not Chastang,

14:46.774 --> 14:47.993
who're we looking for?

14:48.035 --> 14:49.515
Someone who's close enough to Garrett

14:49.516 --> 14:51.474
to have seen the earlier letters,

14:51.518 --> 14:54.477
and someone who's
motivated to frame Chastang.

14:54.521 --> 14:56.349
And someone with a good enough motive

14:56.392 --> 14:58.392
- to go through all that trouble.
- I'd say

14:58.394 --> 14:59.569
greed is a great motive.

14:59.573 --> 15:01.133
Hmm. Someone's been doing some digging.

15:01.134 --> 15:02.150
Yep.

15:02.194 --> 15:03.530
Into Garrett's family.

15:03.573 --> 15:05.619
Turns out his wife came from money.

15:05.662 --> 15:09.362
After she died, he inherited $3 million.

15:09.405 --> 15:12.234
Now that he's dead, his
sole heir is his only child.

15:12.278 --> 15:13.931
Selina Garrett.

15:22.331 --> 15:23.593
Clear!

15:26.161 --> 15:28.033
Clear!

15:30.731 --> 15:32.602
Clear.

15:44.353 --> 15:46.486
Tear gas. Fall back!

15:48.140 --> 15:50.098
Fall back! Go!

16:15.776 --> 16:17.604
Thanks for coming in.

16:17.647 --> 16:19.171
I want to help.

16:19.214 --> 16:22.565
We'll-we'll try and get
you in and out of here

16:22.609 --> 16:23.914
as quickly as possible.

16:23.958 --> 16:25.699
Can I get you anything else?

16:25.742 --> 16:28.267
No, thank you.

16:28.310 --> 16:29.790
- Okay.
- Uh, Ms. Garrett,

16:29.833 --> 16:31.922
are you aware that you are the sole heir

16:31.966 --> 16:34.142
to a pretty large estate?

16:34.186 --> 16:36.144
What?

16:36.188 --> 16:38.668
I... I-I guess.

16:38.712 --> 16:43.195
Yes, uh, my mother's
family was well off.

16:43.238 --> 16:45.545
It's just something I
didn't expect to deal with

16:45.588 --> 16:47.677
for a long time.

16:47.721 --> 16:48.983
Why do you ask?

16:49.026 --> 16:52.029
It's just really for our records.

16:52.073 --> 16:55.163
You were so upset

16:55.207 --> 16:57.165
last night, understandably,

16:57.209 --> 16:59.907
that we didn't get to all our questions.

16:59.950 --> 17:01.996
Like, for instance...

17:02.039 --> 17:06.000
you said that you found
your father around 8:00 p.m.

17:06.042 --> 17:09.089
last night, but you didn't

17:09.134 --> 17:12.180
say where you were earlier that evening.

17:13.724 --> 17:15.009
An alibi?

17:15.051 --> 17:16.771
You're asking for an alibi?

17:16.772 --> 17:17.772
It's a formality.

17:20.710 --> 17:22.669
I, uh...

17:22.712 --> 17:26.020
I was across town at a
session with my therapist.

17:26.063 --> 17:29.502
She has evening hours, and
my session started at 7:00.

17:29.545 --> 17:31.112
Took me half an hour to get home.

17:31.156 --> 17:33.027
Your therapist will be
able to confirm that?

17:33.070 --> 17:34.289
Of course.

17:34.333 --> 17:35.943
I'll give you her number.

17:36.987 --> 17:38.293
Yeah, let's do that.

17:44.343 --> 17:46.867
I'm confused. I was standing right there

17:46.910 --> 17:49.304
when you arrested that
man at the coffee shop.

17:49.348 --> 17:52.655
Yeah. Do you frequent that place often?

17:52.699 --> 17:54.701
It seems a little out
of the way for you.

17:54.744 --> 17:56.703
No, I...

17:56.746 --> 17:58.835
I went for a walk to clear my head.

17:58.879 --> 18:00.620
I decided to grab a coffee.

18:00.663 --> 18:02.404
It's like you're suspecting me.

18:02.448 --> 18:04.363
Selina, we're not
suspecting you of anything.

18:04.406 --> 18:06.756
Well, it sounds like you
think I killed my dad.

18:06.800 --> 18:08.758
That is the last thing
that we want to think.

18:08.802 --> 18:12.501
This is how these investigations work.

18:12.545 --> 18:16.070
We have to rule out every possibility.

18:16.113 --> 18:17.724
And since you've got nothing to hide...

18:17.767 --> 18:19.029
No, I don't.

18:19.073 --> 18:21.031
Then-then you got
nothing to worry about.

18:24.557 --> 18:26.080
Hey, Sebastian.

18:26.123 --> 18:28.038
Hey, I'm-I'm really sorry to bug you.

18:28.082 --> 18:30.215
Oh, no, it's no bother.
I'm glad you called.

18:30.258 --> 18:31.955
You know, we just... we could really use

18:31.999 --> 18:35.045
some fresh eyes... well, your eyes...

18:35.089 --> 18:37.352
um, on this crime scene.

18:37.396 --> 18:39.441
Yeah, happy to help. Uh,
be nice to be needed.

18:39.485 --> 18:41.125
Just send me the
photos, and I'll call you

18:41.169 --> 18:43.089
as soon as I get a chance
to take a look at them.

18:43.090 --> 18:45.018
Great. I'm sending
them for you right now.

18:46.796 --> 18:48.755
Things okay at training?

18:48.798 --> 18:50.191
Made me team leader.

18:50.235 --> 18:52.062
- Oh, yeah? That's great.
- Yeah, right?

18:52.106 --> 18:53.542
Just living the dream.

18:53.586 --> 18:56.153
Being in charge of everyone.

18:56.197 --> 18:58.155
Any questions?

18:58.199 --> 19:00.027
Well, since you ask,

19:00.070 --> 19:02.464
uh, I am kind of wondering
what your secret is.

19:02.508 --> 19:04.945
My secret?

19:04.988 --> 19:06.788
Yeah, you-you make the
whole team leader thing

19:06.789 --> 19:10.124
seem easy, but it's not
easy, in fact. It's...

19:10.167 --> 19:11.343
It's incredibly hard, yeah.

19:11.386 --> 19:12.648
Yeah, and you went

19:12.692 --> 19:14.172
into these offices all over the world

19:14.176 --> 19:15.656
and led groups of complete strangers.

19:15.657 --> 19:17.824
Just... How do you do it?

19:17.827 --> 19:20.917
I mean, there's no formula.

19:20.961 --> 19:23.093
You know, I wasn't always successful.

19:23.137 --> 19:25.095
Come on, it's your superpower.

19:25.139 --> 19:27.489
How do I get these guys to listen to me?

19:27.533 --> 19:29.709
Okay, start by listening to them.

19:29.752 --> 19:31.432
Get to know the people
that you're leading.

19:31.433 --> 19:33.435
You know, strengths, weaknesses.

19:34.583 --> 19:36.324
Help them be seen.

19:36.368 --> 19:38.152
They'll do the same for you.

19:38.195 --> 19:40.502
Well, what do you do if
they don't respect you?

19:41.547 --> 19:45.507
Take stock of, um...

19:45.551 --> 19:47.770
my own strengths and weaknesses

19:47.814 --> 19:50.382
and use them both to connect.

19:50.425 --> 19:53.994
Trust me. It works.

20:01.993 --> 20:03.843
What happened today was my fault.

20:04.874 --> 20:07.312
I take full responsibility.

20:11.272 --> 20:13.143
I started out in the lab, okay?

20:13.187 --> 20:14.710
I was a-a forensics tech,

20:14.754 --> 20:18.235
and, uh, people in my
office, they believed in me.

20:18.239 --> 20:19.759
Encouraged me to become a field agent,

20:19.760 --> 20:21.761
and, I mean, I'm a damn good one.

20:21.804 --> 20:24.067
Still, there's this-this
part of me that feels

20:24.111 --> 20:26.853
like a lab tech pretending
to be a field agent.

20:27.854 --> 20:29.334
That's the part of me that showed up

20:29.377 --> 20:30.509
when I drew the short straw.

20:30.552 --> 20:33.250
I guess I felt the same way

20:33.294 --> 20:35.427
about me being a leader as you guys did.

20:35.470 --> 20:38.212
So, I didn't, uh...

20:38.255 --> 20:40.954
lead the team like I should have.

20:40.997 --> 20:43.783
I failed you, and, uh, I failed us.

20:45.437 --> 20:47.395
You were right.

20:47.439 --> 20:48.570
I was?

20:48.614 --> 20:50.180
Your breach strategy.

20:50.224 --> 20:51.617
It was right.

20:51.660 --> 20:53.314
We should've gone with it.

20:53.358 --> 20:55.229
Yeah, but, I mean, I
second-guessed myself.

20:55.272 --> 20:56.404
Because of me.

20:56.448 --> 20:59.886
I know I come on too strong sometimes.

20:59.929 --> 21:03.324
In my defense, I'm an awesome leader.

21:03.368 --> 21:05.631
Yeah, and I have no doubt.

21:05.674 --> 21:07.937
Just-just not as good at following.

21:07.981 --> 21:10.418
I didn't give you a chance to lead.

21:10.462 --> 21:13.421
You were right about
taking all the gear.

21:13.465 --> 21:15.162
We would have finished in good time

21:15.205 --> 21:17.338
had we had taken those gas masks.

21:17.382 --> 21:20.733
And our lunch wouldn't be
tasting like tear gas right now.

21:20.776 --> 21:23.126
Well,

21:23.170 --> 21:26.695
since we're playing
true confessions here...

21:26.739 --> 21:28.741
I hate being small.

21:30.264 --> 21:32.135
Everyone sees me as the weakest link,

21:32.179 --> 21:35.878
so I overcompensate
like nobody's business,

21:35.922 --> 21:39.665
just trying to prove this
body isn't as frail as it looks.

21:39.708 --> 21:42.450
Yeah, but, I mean, I
don't see frail, you know?

21:42.494 --> 21:44.452
I see, like...

21:44.496 --> 21:47.412
a featherweight champ.

21:47.455 --> 21:48.630
Yeah.

22:02.688 --> 22:04.559
Okay.

22:04.603 --> 22:06.474
Your therapist confirmed

22:06.518 --> 22:09.259
that she was with you
last night at 7:00.

22:09.303 --> 22:11.174
Thank you for clearing it up.

22:11.218 --> 22:12.915
It's okay.

22:12.959 --> 22:14.569
I know you're only doing your job.

22:14.613 --> 22:16.615
I appreciate it.

22:18.051 --> 22:20.053
And I really do

22:20.096 --> 22:22.577
want to help you out, but...

22:22.621 --> 22:25.014
it's hard...

22:25.058 --> 22:26.929
when you're hiding things from me.

22:26.973 --> 22:28.409
What are you talking about?

22:28.453 --> 22:32.326
Well, we asked you if you knew of anyone

22:32.369 --> 22:34.241
who might have had
issues with your father.

22:35.634 --> 22:38.071
Yeah, and I told you there was no one.

22:38.114 --> 22:39.594
Dad got along with people.

22:39.638 --> 22:41.640
Did he get along with Mason Balfour?

22:44.077 --> 22:46.035
How do you know about Mason?

22:46.079 --> 22:49.299
Not from you or from your social media.

22:49.343 --> 22:51.345
You scrubbed

22:51.388 --> 22:54.522
nearly a year's worth of
content from your sites.

22:54.566 --> 22:57.351
Everything associated with Mason.

22:57.394 --> 23:00.615
You two...

23:00.659 --> 23:02.704
you were planning to get married?

23:02.748 --> 23:05.446
And all I've been trying
to do is forget about it,

23:05.490 --> 23:08.057
which has more to do
with my bad life choices,

23:08.101 --> 23:09.537
not my dad's murder.

23:09.581 --> 23:14.368
My people found footage
posted by one of your friends

23:14.411 --> 23:16.370
on her Facebook page.

23:16.413 --> 23:17.850
The engagement party.

23:17.859 --> 23:19.459
She started recording 'cause she thought

23:19.460 --> 23:21.462
your dad was about to make a toast.

23:21.506 --> 23:23.551
Instead, she got this.

23:23.595 --> 23:25.466
She says she posted it to remind you

23:25.510 --> 23:28.556
that you #DodgedABullet.

23:28.600 --> 23:30.210
What? You know what?

23:30.253 --> 23:32.037
- I need to talk to you.
- You know what?

23:32.038 --> 23:33.342
- Get your hands off of me, Selina.
- Mason, stop.

23:33.343 --> 23:34.648
- You're gonna do this right now?
- Why? Why?

23:34.649 --> 23:36.128
- It didn't... Excuse me.
- You are making a scene.

23:36.129 --> 23:37.365
Oh, I'm making a scene?

23:37.409 --> 23:39.567
- Mason...
- You're the one who's humiliating me.

23:39.611 --> 23:42.091
You refuse to toast us at
our own engagement party.

23:42.135 --> 23:43.963
That's right. I just can't do it.

23:44.006 --> 23:45.747
- Dad, please.
- I'm sorry, Selina.

23:45.791 --> 23:47.001
Look at the way that he is behaving.

23:47.002 --> 23:48.070
- I know.
- You know what?

23:48.071 --> 23:49.071
You can do a lot better.

23:49.073 --> 23:51.313
Why don't you come here and
say that to my face, old man?

23:51.314 --> 23:52.452
Mason, just back off. Stop.

23:52.493 --> 23:54.016
You're gonna take his side?

23:54.060 --> 23:55.757
You know what? Screw you both!

23:55.801 --> 23:57.280
- Happy now?
- Mason...

23:57.324 --> 23:59.761
You're getting exactly what you wanted.

23:59.805 --> 24:01.850
That was less than a month ago.

24:01.894 --> 24:03.896
You didn't forget.

24:05.027 --> 24:08.335
You chose not to tell us. Why?

24:10.642 --> 24:12.992
Because it was the
worst night of my life.

24:13.035 --> 24:14.315
Because it doesn't have anything

24:14.341 --> 24:16.517
to do with what happened to my father.

24:16.561 --> 24:20.173
Selina, Mason argued with him.

24:20.216 --> 24:22.741
Blamed him for breaking
up your relationship.

24:22.784 --> 24:24.481
My dad was a Navy man.

24:24.525 --> 24:27.746
He liked order and routine,
and that's not Mason.

24:27.789 --> 24:30.531
So what is... Mason?

24:30.575 --> 24:32.577
Because as far as I can see,

24:32.620 --> 24:34.883
he's violent and vindictive.

24:34.927 --> 24:37.320
He was just drunk.

24:37.364 --> 24:41.150
And Dad wasn't the reason
we broke off the engagement.

24:43.152 --> 24:45.459
Is that what Mason will
say when we talk with him?

24:45.502 --> 24:47.592
You're talking to him?

24:47.635 --> 24:49.202
Yeah, we're bringing him in right now.

24:49.245 --> 24:51.770
Why would you do that?

24:52.693 --> 24:55.905
See, your reaction right here...

24:55.907 --> 24:57.211
it makes me

24:57.253 --> 24:59.212
feel like there's more to the story.

24:59.255 --> 25:00.996
Where is she?

25:01.040 --> 25:02.519
Selina?!

25:02.563 --> 25:04.478
Where the hell are you?

25:05.914 --> 25:08.221
You bitch! What are
you trying to do to me?

25:08.264 --> 25:10.658
- You set me up!
- I didn't, I swear.

25:10.702 --> 25:12.878
They found a video of
you fighting with my dad.

25:12.921 --> 25:15.620
- I'd never turn you in. Never.
- Move!

25:30.069 --> 25:31.723
You got a temper, Mason.

25:31.766 --> 25:34.464
I don't like being accused
of things that I didn't do.

25:34.508 --> 25:35.828
What about the things you did do?

25:35.857 --> 25:37.617
You got quite a rap
sheet. You like to fight.

25:37.618 --> 25:39.382
I don't like being disrespected.

25:39.426 --> 25:41.346
Yeah, is that what happened
with Captain Garrett?

25:41.347 --> 25:43.125
- He disrespected you?
- Who gives a crap?

25:43.169 --> 25:44.953
We do, 'cause he's dead.

25:44.997 --> 25:46.172
Where were you last night?

25:46.215 --> 25:47.521
Out.

25:47.564 --> 25:49.131
Out. Out. Out where?

25:49.175 --> 25:50.567
At a bar.

25:50.611 --> 25:52.569
This is New Orleans.

25:52.613 --> 25:54.267
Can you narrow it down?

25:54.310 --> 25:56.835
A bunch of 'em... in the Quarter.

25:56.878 --> 25:59.446
- Who were you with?
- Myself. I went there to drink,

25:59.489 --> 26:00.926
not to socialize.

26:00.969 --> 26:04.538
- You got receipts?
- Paid in cash.

26:04.581 --> 26:06.148
In other words, no alibi.

26:06.192 --> 26:08.411
I don't need an alibi.
I didn't do anything.

26:08.455 --> 26:09.804
You fought with Captain Garrett

26:09.848 --> 26:11.937
less than a month before
he was bludgeoned to death

26:11.980 --> 26:13.900
and he busted up your
engagement to his daughter.

26:13.901 --> 26:15.549
I think you need an alibi.

26:15.592 --> 26:17.232
Although, to be honest, if Garrett

26:17.246 --> 26:20.249
tanked my relationship,
I'd be pissed, too.

26:20.293 --> 26:21.686
He didn't tank anything.

26:21.729 --> 26:24.166
Garrett didn't like
me, I didn't like him.

26:24.210 --> 26:26.473
But Selina couldn't care
less what he thought.

26:28.475 --> 26:30.259
She made up her own mind.

26:30.303 --> 26:32.566
- She's the one who broke it off.
- Hmm.

26:32.609 --> 26:34.829
Saying you got no hard feelings?

26:34.873 --> 26:36.744
For him?

26:36.788 --> 26:38.485
Dude did me a favor.

26:38.528 --> 26:40.356
Hmm.

26:48.016 --> 26:49.757
Practice run complete.

26:49.801 --> 26:52.064
Is that a cell phone?

26:52.107 --> 26:54.196
Turn it off!

26:54.240 --> 26:56.242
Where is it?

27:00.550 --> 27:02.117
Hey.

27:02.161 --> 27:03.684
Give it to me.

27:03.728 --> 27:05.860
- What?
- It's contraband. I have to take it.

27:05.904 --> 27:07.644
I'm not gonna rat you out, trust me.

27:09.168 --> 27:11.126
What are you doing?

27:11.170 --> 27:14.521
You get caught with a cell
phone, we all pay the price.

27:14.564 --> 27:16.244
It's all right, okay?
Don't worry about it.

27:16.245 --> 27:18.438
I need the phone to stay
in touch with my son.

27:18.481 --> 27:22.529
- You have a son?
- Zach. He just turned four.

27:22.572 --> 27:26.620
The phone is so he can message
me when he really needs to.

27:26.663 --> 27:29.014
I have to be able to reassure
him when he reaches out.

27:30.842 --> 27:33.366
But he's in good hands
while you're here, right?

27:35.063 --> 27:36.543
My husband Tim is a great dad.

27:38.458 --> 27:40.634
I learned a long time
ago that the less I say

27:40.677 --> 27:42.157
about my personal life, the better.

27:42.201 --> 27:44.551
Yeah.

27:44.594 --> 27:47.119
All right, listen, I'm gonna
hold on to the phone.

27:47.162 --> 27:50.370
But if Zach tries to reach out to
you, I'll make sure you can respond.

27:50.413 --> 27:51.427
Yeah?

27:51.471 --> 27:52.733
Okay?

27:52.777 --> 27:54.387
All right.

27:57.825 --> 27:59.827
Hi. He doesn't have an alibi.

27:59.871 --> 28:03.091
Guy we saw in the squad room is
definitely capable of violence.

28:03.135 --> 28:05.833
He could've planted the tire
iron in Lawrence Chastang's car.

28:05.877 --> 28:08.227
Mm, I don't think he's smart
enough to think of that.

28:08.270 --> 28:10.533
Plus, how would he know about
Chastang's death threats?

28:10.577 --> 28:12.622
Only from Selina.

28:12.666 --> 28:15.756
But she claims that she
had no idea, either.

28:15.800 --> 28:18.454
We have nothing to
tie him to this murder,

28:18.498 --> 28:20.761
except his bad attitude.

28:20.805 --> 28:25.548
Selina refuses to believe
that Mason was involved.

28:25.592 --> 28:27.333
And...

28:27.376 --> 28:29.335
I can see a "but" forming.

28:29.378 --> 28:32.033
She's genuinely afraid of him.

28:32.077 --> 28:33.861
I mean, she was shaking like a leaf

28:33.905 --> 28:35.558
when you guys brought him in.

28:35.602 --> 28:37.602
Okay, so, what... you think
she's covering for him?

28:37.604 --> 28:39.258
Hey.

28:39.301 --> 28:41.608
I got something.

28:41.651 --> 28:43.305
I asked Sebastian to take a look

28:43.349 --> 28:45.742
at our crime scene
photos with fresh eyes.

28:45.786 --> 28:47.875
He notes that the scene
was severely contaminated

28:47.919 --> 28:49.485
by the first person to arrive.

28:49.529 --> 28:51.792
Well, that would be Selina,
but she was in a panic

28:51.836 --> 28:53.054
trying to revive her father.

28:53.098 --> 28:54.708
Well, did Sebastian read her statement?

28:54.711 --> 28:56.191
I didn't want Sebastian's conclusions

28:56.192 --> 28:57.798
to be influenced by anything other

28:57.842 --> 28:59.060
than the physical evidence.

28:59.104 --> 29:00.757
Okay. What's his take?

29:00.801 --> 29:02.368
Sebastian pointed out

29:02.411 --> 29:04.283
Selina's fingerprints on nearly

29:04.326 --> 29:06.154
every surface in her father's study.

29:06.198 --> 29:07.764
Can this be attributed to shock?

29:07.808 --> 29:09.592
Oh, this is beyond shock.

29:09.636 --> 29:12.291
We're talking every shelf,
lamp, corner and crevice.

29:12.334 --> 29:14.249
- That's strange.
- Yeah. Then there's

29:14.293 --> 29:16.643
Selina's footprints through
the blood. They're everywhere.

29:16.686 --> 29:18.950
Sebastian counted 92

29:18.993 --> 29:21.604
complete or partial steps
all attributed to her.

29:21.648 --> 29:23.606
There's other, larger prints,

29:23.650 --> 29:25.739
but Selina's obscures them all.

29:25.782 --> 29:27.219
The killer's.

29:27.262 --> 29:29.177
Right. Sebastian believes

29:29.221 --> 29:31.658
that Selina deliberately
contaminated the scene

29:31.701 --> 29:33.417
in order to obscure or destroy evidence.

29:33.461 --> 29:36.837
Okay, but why? Her alibi was rock solid.

29:36.881 --> 29:39.081
Yeah, but it makes sense
if she's protecting the killer.

29:42.364 --> 29:46.542
Selina... was terrified of Mason
when you brought him in.

29:46.586 --> 29:48.327
I thought...

29:48.370 --> 29:50.416
Thought she was afraid

29:50.459 --> 29:52.548
that he'd hurt her.

29:52.592 --> 29:54.594
But it wasn't that at all.

29:56.030 --> 29:58.859
She was afraid that he'd flip on her.

30:00.861 --> 30:02.819
Because they're in this together.

30:16.094 --> 30:19.662
If you're right, Pride, Selina
and Mason faked their breakup,

30:19.706 --> 30:21.795
conspired to kill Captain Garrett,

30:21.838 --> 30:24.624
and framed Chastang for it.

30:24.667 --> 30:26.467
That would mean that
Selina had to be on board

30:26.468 --> 30:28.497
with Mason brutally
murdering her father.

30:28.541 --> 30:30.499
- That's really cold.
- Yeah,

30:30.543 --> 30:32.423
but maybe Mason didn't
want to share the details

30:32.424 --> 30:33.850
of what he was planning.

30:33.894 --> 30:36.157
Maybe he just wanted
her to have an alibi

30:36.201 --> 30:38.203
and not be there for the actual kill.

30:38.246 --> 30:41.249
Well, Captain Garrett was never
gonna approve of the marriage,

30:41.293 --> 30:43.286
which meant no inheritance.

30:43.330 --> 30:44.538
Well, love and greed...

30:44.540 --> 30:46.300
- that's a powerful motive.
- Mm-hmm.

30:46.324 --> 30:48.604
I mean, if you have to
kill a parent over it.

30:48.648 --> 30:51.303
They had three million reasons
to get Garrett out of the way.

30:51.346 --> 30:53.609
And Lawrence Chastang
was the perfect patsy.

30:53.653 --> 30:57.352
Selina was living with her father.

30:58.919 --> 31:02.053
She could've accessed his case files.

31:02.096 --> 31:04.794
No, even if Chastang denied
writing those earlier letters,

31:04.838 --> 31:06.405
he fit the bill.

31:06.448 --> 31:08.102
The minute they found out that

31:08.146 --> 31:10.713
he was being released from
prison, they made their move.

31:10.757 --> 31:14.369
We've got a bunch of evidence
that points to Chastang's guilt,

31:14.413 --> 31:16.937
and nothing but a theory to
implicate Selina and Mason.

31:16.981 --> 31:18.983
What's our play?

31:19.026 --> 31:21.942
Just need one of 'em to crack,
and that'll open the floodgates.

31:21.986 --> 31:23.030
We need an angle.

31:23.074 --> 31:24.771
I'd go with "prisoner's dilemma".

31:24.814 --> 31:26.381
Oldie, but a goodie.

31:26.425 --> 31:28.035
Even mocked up props for y'all.

31:28.079 --> 31:29.602
Thank you.

31:30.777 --> 31:31.857
All right, let's get to it.

31:44.704 --> 31:46.401
What?

31:46.445 --> 31:48.186
You remind me of the
guys I grew up with.

31:48.229 --> 31:49.709
Real brutes.

31:49.752 --> 31:51.363
You don't remind me of anyone.

31:51.406 --> 31:52.712
Those guys were always good

31:52.755 --> 31:54.714
to their girlfriends;
never lifted a hand.

31:54.757 --> 31:56.194
That's where the comparison ends.

31:57.630 --> 32:00.111
I never hit Selina or any woman.

32:00.114 --> 32:01.674
What if I told you she went to the cops

32:01.675 --> 32:02.765
about you a few weeks ago,

32:02.809 --> 32:04.724
looking for a restraining order

32:04.767 --> 32:06.508
because you beat her?

32:08.771 --> 32:10.251
No way.

32:10.295 --> 32:12.514
Got a police report right here.

32:12.558 --> 32:16.431
Says, "Female victim was
terrified of the male suspect.

32:16.475 --> 32:18.216
"Victim told the detective the suspect

32:18.259 --> 32:20.740
"grabbed her forcibly by the wrist.

32:20.783 --> 32:23.090
Punched her".

32:24.135 --> 32:25.745
That's a lie.

32:25.788 --> 32:27.094
Maybe. Maybe not.

32:28.574 --> 32:30.663
You're terrified of him.

32:30.706 --> 32:32.143
I'm not.

32:32.186 --> 32:34.754
I just didn't want him
to get the wrong idea.

32:36.408 --> 32:37.452
Has he, uh...

32:37.496 --> 32:39.759
has he ever hurt you?

32:39.802 --> 32:42.544
You don't understand.

32:42.588 --> 32:43.937
But your father did, didn't he?

32:43.980 --> 32:45.895
I'm guessing

32:45.939 --> 32:48.115
he gave you an ultimatum.

32:48.159 --> 32:50.117
If you marry Mason,

32:50.161 --> 32:52.685
you lose the money.

32:52.728 --> 32:55.048
Maybe she convinced you
to stage the whole thing.

32:55.049 --> 32:56.732
Fake the breakup.

32:56.776 --> 32:58.517
No.

32:58.560 --> 33:00.475
Help get rid of her father.

33:00.519 --> 33:02.695
And then, in the end, you'd get the girl

33:02.738 --> 33:05.785
and the $3 million she's
supposed to inherit.

33:05.828 --> 33:07.787
That's not what's happening.

33:07.830 --> 33:09.876
It's a pretty good plan though.

33:09.919 --> 33:13.009
But wait, just hear me out.

33:13.053 --> 33:15.795
What if she realized

33:15.838 --> 33:18.624
that splitting the $3 million one way

33:18.667 --> 33:20.452
is better than two?

33:25.500 --> 33:26.860
- He's buying it.
- Mm-hmm.

33:26.861 --> 33:28.634
That wiped the smirk off his face.

33:28.677 --> 33:29.983
She would never do that to me.

33:30.026 --> 33:31.289
Which part?

33:31.332 --> 33:32.899
Try to get you to kill her father?

33:32.942 --> 33:34.901
Or sacrifice you to the cops?

33:34.944 --> 33:37.817
None of it.

33:37.860 --> 33:40.907
It's only been... three weeks

33:40.950 --> 33:44.128
since you called off the engagement.

33:44.171 --> 33:46.652
He's...

33:46.695 --> 33:50.221
already seeing other people.

33:50.264 --> 33:52.179
That's not true.

33:52.223 --> 33:54.181
I own a bar.

33:54.225 --> 33:56.009
Bartenders talk.

33:56.052 --> 33:57.750
A lot.

33:57.793 --> 33:59.839
Mason's been working
every cocktail waitress

33:59.882 --> 34:01.536
in the Quarter.

34:02.668 --> 34:03.668
And I'm sorry.

34:03.669 --> 34:05.105
I don't mean to hurt you,

34:05.149 --> 34:07.977
but you should know
who you're covering for.

34:08.978 --> 34:09.978
I got...

34:09.978 --> 34:13.592
names, if you want 'em.

34:13.635 --> 34:15.724
No. I don't care.

34:15.768 --> 34:17.857
We're not together.

34:17.900 --> 34:20.033
I'm just not convinced that's true.

34:21.077 --> 34:23.384
I think you staged your breakup

34:23.428 --> 34:26.387
so you could stay in your father's will.

34:26.431 --> 34:28.302
It's all about that money.

34:28.346 --> 34:29.408
That's not me.

34:29.451 --> 34:32.350
But it is Mason.

34:34.003 --> 34:36.658
Even if you confess to me right now

34:36.702 --> 34:39.966
that she put you up to the murder,

34:40.009 --> 34:42.449
she'd just turn around and say
it was you who intimidated her.

34:42.489 --> 34:43.926
She'd walk away clean.

34:45.580 --> 34:48.540
Now, we both know how this ends.

34:48.583 --> 34:51.891
Like I said, you remind me
of the guys I grew up with.

34:51.934 --> 34:54.937
I don't want you to take the fall here.

34:54.981 --> 34:57.070
You know what I mean?

35:00.213 --> 35:03.019
Mason has, uh,

35:03.063 --> 35:08.647
opened an offshore bank account.

35:08.690 --> 35:10.410
There's not much in it.
A few hundred bucks.

35:10.411 --> 35:14.087
His intention is clear.

35:14.130 --> 35:16.002
You come into money.

35:16.045 --> 35:17.917
He comes back into your life.

35:18.961 --> 35:21.268
Once you're married,

35:21.312 --> 35:22.748
he drains your accounts

35:22.791 --> 35:25.446
and takes off with...

35:25.490 --> 35:27.579
one of his waitresses.

35:33.193 --> 35:35.500
Mason killed your father.

35:35.543 --> 35:36.871
I know it.

35:36.915 --> 35:38.481
You do, too.

35:41.201 --> 35:43.203
Can I ask you a question?

35:43.247 --> 35:44.726
Yeah, of course.

35:47.216 --> 35:48.391
Am I free to go?

35:49.035 --> 35:51.625
Well, Mason...

35:51.668 --> 35:53.126
Asked you a question.

35:53.169 --> 35:55.607
Can I leave?

35:57.870 --> 36:01.090
I'm telling you, man,
she's giving you up.

36:01.134 --> 36:03.136
Save yourself.

36:03.179 --> 36:06.139
I'm gonna take that as a yes.

36:08.811 --> 36:09.822
It's okay.

36:09.865 --> 36:12.202
Just tell me what Mason did.

36:12.246 --> 36:14.117
I want to.

36:14.161 --> 36:16.206
Selina!

36:18.774 --> 36:20.733
They read you your rights?

36:22.256 --> 36:24.171
Then they got nothing.

36:24.214 --> 36:26.042
Come on, baby, let's go.

36:28.262 --> 36:29.698
No, Selina.

36:30.142 --> 36:31.970
I'm afraid I have to go.

36:33.293 --> 36:35.909
Thank you for caring.

36:48.282 --> 36:50.415
- You okay?
- Yeah.

37:31.398 --> 37:32.834
- Yes, man!
- We got this.

37:32.878 --> 37:34.053
All right.

37:34.096 --> 37:35.272
Yes!

37:35.316 --> 37:38.075
Blue Team, congratulations.

37:38.119 --> 37:39.990
You've come in first
place in the final drill.

37:40.034 --> 37:41.775
Nice.

37:41.818 --> 37:44.212
Unfortunately, you've
also been disqualified.

37:44.256 --> 37:45.648
What? Why?

37:45.692 --> 37:47.454
We won fair and square.

37:48.097 --> 37:49.435
A check of the barracks turned up

37:49.478 --> 37:53.186
a contraband cell phone
with Agent Lund's belongings.

37:54.309 --> 37:57.407
Yeah, there's no excuse for
me to have my phone here.

37:57.451 --> 37:59.453
I take full responsibility
for the infraction.

38:00.855 --> 38:02.931
Sir, that's not true. The
phone belongs to me.

38:02.975 --> 38:05.194
Agent Lund confiscated it
and was going to turn it in.

38:05.238 --> 38:06.568
- No, sir...
- Commander Taylor,

38:06.569 --> 38:08.249
- it was my phone.
- I will take the blame.

38:08.250 --> 38:10.410
- I take full responsibility...
- All right!

38:10.411 --> 38:12.661
Stand down, Blue Team.

38:13.341 --> 38:14.777
One person fails,

38:14.821 --> 38:16.562
you all fail.

38:16.605 --> 38:18.999
Doesn't matter whose phone it is,

38:19.042 --> 38:21.436
the disqualification stands.

38:29.139 --> 38:32.055
As I said at the start,
victory is earned

38:32.099 --> 38:34.188
on the strength of teamwork.

38:34.231 --> 38:37.104
Yes, sir, you did say that.

38:37.147 --> 38:38.497
You failed as a team,

38:38.540 --> 38:41.717
because you have become
a team, Agent Lund.

38:43.110 --> 38:45.155
You may have lost the competition,

38:45.199 --> 38:47.288
but you did not fail the drill.

38:49.203 --> 38:51.771
And you did not fail each other.

38:56.384 --> 38:59.256
Welcome to NCIS REACT.

39:00.345 --> 39:03.217
Yeah!

39:03.260 --> 39:05.350
- Yes!
- All right. Nice work, nice work.

39:36.468 --> 39:39.427
I can't believe it.

39:39.471 --> 39:41.429
You lost the battle, not the war.

39:41.473 --> 39:43.126
We didn't just lose.

39:43.170 --> 39:44.171
We were routed.

39:44.214 --> 39:46.652
Loretta's right.

39:46.695 --> 39:48.393
They'll slip up,

39:48.436 --> 39:49.959
and we'll be there when they do.

39:50.003 --> 39:52.353
Exactly. And I'm gonna get

39:52.397 --> 39:53.963

39:54.007 --> 39:55.225
Nothing for me, thanks.

39:55.269 --> 39:57.053
Figures.

39:57.097 --> 39:58.697
Just wanted to stop
by and say thank you.

39:58.698 --> 40:01.057
- For what?
- Doing right by Lawrence Chastang.

40:01.101 --> 40:04.278
You prevented an innocent man
from being unjustly convicted.

40:04.321 --> 40:06.062
Eh, we're just doing our job.

40:06.106 --> 40:07.890
The way we do it even
without the benefit

40:07.934 --> 40:09.544
of your 25-year-old wisdom.

40:10.550 --> 40:14.092
I think she's extending
an olive branch, Gregorio.

40:14.135 --> 40:17.791
It's traditional to say
something nice in return.

40:19.710 --> 40:21.189
Well, you did good, too.

40:21.233 --> 40:22.756
Your instincts aren't all that bad.

40:22.800 --> 40:24.640
When you go through
puberty, you might actually

40:24.641 --> 40:26.194
have a future in this job.

40:26.238 --> 40:29.197
Thanks... I think.

40:29.241 --> 40:31.199
Like that, Pride?

40:31.243 --> 40:33.201
Something like that.

40:36.030 --> 40:37.989
Pride.

40:40.339 --> 40:42.471
What? When?

40:46.737 --> 40:48.521
Okay, on my way.

40:48.564 --> 40:49.653
Everything okay?

40:51.263 --> 40:52.351
I don't think so.

Dwayne, thanks for coming down.

41:09.785 --> 41:11.865
- Ms. Garrett asked for you by name.
- What happened?

41:11.866 --> 41:13.877
Looks like he was getting
pretty rough with her.

41:13.920 --> 41:16.705
She was fighting for her life.

41:16.749 --> 41:19.752
Selina did this?

41:19.795 --> 41:22.668
Self-defense. Abusive boyfriend.

41:22.711 --> 41:24.713
She called it in herself.

41:26.106 --> 41:28.108
I have no doubt.

41:45.299 --> 41:47.726
I'm so sorry.

41:47.728 --> 41:49.304
Y-You were right.

41:49.347 --> 41:52.045
You were right about everything.

41:52.089 --> 41:55.440
He hurt me, and he killed my father.

41:55.483 --> 41:57.572
And he was gonna kill me, too.

41:57.616 --> 42:01.968
Thank you so much, Special Agent Pride.

42:03.491 --> 42:05.276
I couldn't have done it without you.
