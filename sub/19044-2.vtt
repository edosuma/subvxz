This kid reeks of booze!
[ Beeping ]

20:14.847 --> 20:17.748
No, no, no, no, no.
Are you drunk? Don't be drunk.

20:17.750 --> 20:18.916
Yeah.
How could you
let this happen?

20:18.918 --> 20:22.720
I was the only one bartending!
He must have been takin' sips
out of people's beers.

20:22.722 --> 20:24.755
All right.
Brew some coffee.
You can't give him coffee!

20:24.757 --> 20:29.627
Let go of that!
Let go of that!
Get him out of here, Charlie!

20:29.629 --> 20:31.963
Charlie!

20:32.698 --> 20:34.265
Okay, here we go!

20:34.267 --> 20:35.833
Fresh air! Have a seat!
Sit down! Fresh air!

20:35.835 --> 20:38.669
You suck!
You suck, all right?
Breathe it in. Fresh air now.

20:38.671 --> 20:40.705
You suck and you have
an ugly face!
You suck!

20:40.707 --> 20:44.508
You have an ugly face, okay?
You try and push people's
buttons all the time!

20:44.510 --> 20:46.711
And you get in their head,
and you drive them crazy!

20:46.713 --> 20:50.548
Maybe that's why you don't
have a dad anymore!
Oh, my God!

20:50.550 --> 20:53.017
- What are you doing?
- I'm drunk.

20:53.019 --> 20:55.286
He's drunk?
He's not drunk.

20:55.288 --> 20:56.754
I am drunk!
You're not drunk.

20:56.756 --> 20:58.789
He sounds drunk.
I am drunk!

20:58.791 --> 21:01.993
You're not drunk!
Stop saying that!

21:01.995 --> 21:03.961
He's fine.

- Yeah?

21:18.311 --> 21:20.845
Charlie Kelly.
Yeah?

21:20.847 --> 21:23.714
From high school.
Oh, yeah.

21:23.716 --> 21:26.851
I didn't recognize you
without all your acne.

21:26.853 --> 21:28.119
Yeah.
[ Chuckling ]

21:28.121 --> 21:31.522
All right, listen, I need
to talk to you about your kid.
Why?

21:31.524 --> 21:35.026
Uh, let's see. Because your kid
has serious emotional problems.
Why?

21:35.028 --> 21:37.928
I don't know. Maybe because
you're not there as a father.
Why?

21:37.930 --> 21:39.864
You're kidding me?
This your little game?
Why?

21:39.866 --> 21:44.602
This is what you're doin'? This
is what you're doin' to me?
Why?
