WEBVTT

00:01.769 --> 00:03.802
Here we go.

00:03.804 --> 00:06.605
Well, looks like we're
one short on the cupcakes.

00:06.607 --> 00:10.109
That's the chance you take
when you drop in unannounced.

00:11.278 --> 00:12.978
Hey!

00:12.980 --> 00:15.814
ALF, we're one short
because you had yours already.

00:15.816 --> 00:17.049
Oh!

00:17.051 --> 00:20.519
And I dropped in unannounced

00:20.521 --> 00:23.355
because I have some
incredibly exciting news

00:23.357 --> 00:26.892
I wanna share
with those I love most..

00:26.894 --> 00:29.628
...and those
I can barely tolerate.

00:29.630 --> 00:31.597
Willie, I think she means us.

00:33.000 --> 00:35.334
Whizzer has asked me
to marry him.

00:35.336 --> 00:37.236
Oh! Ho-ho, mom!

00:37.238 --> 00:40.739
That's fantastic! We're gonna
have a Grandpa Whizzer.

00:40.741 --> 00:43.542
(Willie)
Congratulations, Dorothy.

00:43.544 --> 00:45.677
I'm so excited for you.

00:45.679 --> 00:48.213
Ah! Oh, you're excited?

00:48.215 --> 00:50.649
I am really excited.

00:50.651 --> 00:52.885
You're probably
too excited to eat.

00:54.655 --> 00:56.855
Now you just gotta
have the wedding here.

00:56.857 --> 00:59.425
Oh, Kate, I was hoping
you would say that.

00:59.427 --> 01:01.427
Here? In my house?

01:02.596 --> 01:04.863
Yes, here, in our house.

01:04.865 --> 01:06.732
Now Willie and I were
married in my mother's house

01:06.734 --> 01:08.600
and she is going
to be married here.

01:08.602 --> 01:10.002
It's a tradition.

01:10.004 --> 01:12.171
Traditions are like plates.

01:12.173 --> 01:14.139
They're made to be broken.

01:15.209 --> 01:18.110
We are having the wedding here.

01:18.112 --> 01:19.411
When's it gonna be?

01:19.413 --> 01:21.113
We thought sometime next month.

01:21.115 --> 01:24.016
What day?
I might not be available.

01:24.018 --> 01:26.085
You won't. You'll be
in the garage that day.

01:28.389 --> 01:29.888
I think you know why.

01:29.890 --> 01:32.624
I know, I know. Tradition.

01:34.361 --> 01:37.329
[theme music]

02:04.391 --> 02:07.359
[music continues]

02:36.991 --> 02:38.423
[instrumental music]

02:38.425 --> 02:42.828
Yes, I'd like the number
for Sir Tux Formal Wear.

02:42.830 --> 02:44.596
You know, I think it's nice
that grandma's getting

02:44.598 --> 02:47.232
married here instead
of in some big old hall.

02:48.869 --> 02:51.703
Maybe you'd like
to have your wedding here.

02:51.705 --> 02:54.039
Mom, don't even joke
about something like that.

02:55.476 --> 02:57.342
Uh, yes, this is Willie Tanner.

02:57.344 --> 03:01.313
I'd like to reserve a tux
for Saturday, please.

03:01.315 --> 03:03.115
Oh, I think you've got my
measurements on file.

03:03.117 --> 03:05.417
I was in there in 1967.

03:06.887 --> 03:08.654
Oh, right.

03:08.656 --> 03:11.523
Well, add two inches
to the waist

03:11.525 --> 03:13.358
and lose the bell-bottoms.

03:14.361 --> 03:15.894
Hey, good water, Kate.

03:15.896 --> 03:19.298
Pick up some more of these
tomorrow, will you?

03:19.300 --> 03:23.235
ALF, that water was supposed to
be for the wedding guests.

03:23.237 --> 03:25.571
Well, I only drank
three of these.

03:25.573 --> 03:28.307
I was trying to get
rid of my hiccups.

03:28.309 --> 03:30.075
What hiccups?

03:30.077 --> 03:31.577
[hiccup]

03:31.579 --> 03:32.911
Those hiccups.

03:34.682 --> 03:39.017
That is the strangest
hiccup I've ever heard.

03:39.019 --> 03:41.186
Well, here's another one.

03:41.188 --> 03:42.221
[hiccup]

03:43.157 --> 03:44.356
Oh, no!

03:44.358 --> 03:45.390
Oh..

03:45.392 --> 03:46.425
[hiccup]

03:46.427 --> 03:48.327
...yes.

03:48.329 --> 03:49.995
You're the first humans

03:49.997 --> 03:54.900
who've ever heard the
dreaded Melmacian hiccups.

03:54.902 --> 03:58.837
Well, uh, what is it
that makes them so dreaded

03:58.839 --> 04:02.174
besides that irritating
metallic echo?

04:02.176 --> 04:05.043
That irritating metallic echo

04:05.045 --> 04:08.747
gets louder and louder.
Day by day.

04:08.749 --> 04:11.216
Week by week. Year by..

04:11.218 --> 04:12.251
[hiccup]

04:12.253 --> 04:14.052
...year.

04:14.054 --> 04:16.021
How many years
are we talking about?

04:16.757 --> 04:17.789
I'm not sure.

04:17.791 --> 04:19.391
[hiccup]

04:19.393 --> 04:22.894
My Uncle Tinkle
had them for 50 years.

04:22.896 --> 04:24.062
Tinkle?

04:24.064 --> 04:25.364
Good idea.

04:26.233 --> 04:29.201
[instrumental music]

04:32.606 --> 04:33.872
What's he doing?

04:33.874 --> 04:35.240
He's still sitting in the closet

04:35.242 --> 04:36.875
breathing into a paper bag.

04:36.877 --> 04:39.645
Well, it must be working.
He hasn't hiccupped in..

04:39.647 --> 04:42.948
[ALF hiccupping]

04:42.950 --> 04:44.883
...fifty two seconds.

04:44.885 --> 04:48.086
Okay, okay, we've tried sugar.

04:48.088 --> 04:50.656
We've tried honey.
We've tried lemon juice.

04:50.658 --> 04:52.658
We've tried half a turkey.

04:53.727 --> 04:55.594
You gave him our turkey?

04:55.596 --> 04:59.598
He said it was
a bold experiment.

04:59.600 --> 05:02.334
Well, I hardly got
any sleep last night.

05:02.336 --> 05:04.002
I slept like a baby.

05:04.004 --> 05:07.572
A baby trapped
inside a percolator.

05:07.574 --> 05:09.541
I guess you don't want
any coffee then.

05:11.245 --> 05:13.512
I'll take mine black.

05:13.514 --> 05:15.580
You're too young.

05:15.582 --> 05:17.215
I feel old.

05:18.018 --> 05:19.518
[ALF hiccupping]

05:19.520 --> 05:21.920
Well, that sure didn't work.

05:27.528 --> 05:30.162
[sighs]
ALF, I am sorry that you're
going through this

05:30.164 --> 05:32.764
but I do hope that
your hiccups will be gone

05:32.766 --> 05:34.666
before the wedding tomorrow.

05:34.668 --> 05:37.135
[hiccup]

05:37.137 --> 05:39.771
ALF, why don't you try
holding your breath again?

05:39.773 --> 05:41.873
That should work.

05:41.875 --> 05:43.442
Okay.

05:43.444 --> 05:44.676
[inhales deeply]

05:48.115 --> 05:51.083

06:01.462 --> 06:04.463
ALF, it's Trevor.
Uh, take your hiccups

06:04.465 --> 06:06.198
and get out of here.

06:06.200 --> 06:09.901
Fine, if he complains about
the turkey bones in his yard

06:09.903 --> 06:11.069
play dumb.

06:15.843 --> 06:17.376
Is everyone decent?

06:17.378 --> 06:19.378
If not, I won't stay too long.

06:20.547 --> 06:22.414
Oh, I'm sorry.

06:22.416 --> 06:24.416
I didn't know you
were saying grace.

06:25.586 --> 06:27.652
We're finished.

06:27.654 --> 06:28.653
Amen.

06:30.858 --> 06:32.391
What's up, Trevor?

06:32.393 --> 06:33.725
Ah, it's Raquel.

06:33.727 --> 06:36.862
She said a weird noise
kept her up all night.

06:36.864 --> 06:38.830
I couldn't hear anything
from my bedroom.

06:40.067 --> 06:41.433
Weird noise?

06:41.435 --> 06:43.602
Yeah. Kind of a metallic..

At first I thought it was my pet

choking on a rat.

06:49.943 --> 06:50.976
[ALF hiccupping]

06:51.879 --> 06:54.012
It's coming from here.

06:54.014 --> 06:55.747
Oh, that noise.

06:55.749 --> 06:59.384
That's our garbage disposal
spinning the fritz.

06:59.386 --> 07:01.119
Ah! That's why

07:01.121 --> 07:03.622
you've been throwing
turkey bones on my lawn.

07:04.691 --> 07:06.291
I'm sorry, Trevor.

07:06.293 --> 07:09.361
Someone...I-I'll clean
that up right away.

07:09.363 --> 07:10.862
Ah, that's okay.

07:10.864 --> 07:12.297
Good fertilizer.

07:12.299 --> 07:14.399
Well, hate to eat and run.

07:14.401 --> 07:17.035
But Raquel has breakfast ready.

Hey, Willie.

07:54.641 --> 07:56.475
About the same, huh?

07:56.477 --> 07:57.909
What are you looking for?

07:57.911 --> 08:00.812
My Melmacian medical

08:00.814 --> 08:02.647
I might have a cure
for the hiccups.

- 'Mmm.'
- 'Oh.'

08:04.284 --> 08:05.684
- Here, hold this, Willie.
- What is it?

08:05.686 --> 08:07.452

Oh, wait. These are my crayons.

08:30.878 --> 08:34.112
Well, I don't remember.
I only used it once.

08:34.114 --> 08:36.281
When I was mauled by a gnarf.

08:37.451 --> 08:38.650
A gnarf?

08:38.652 --> 08:40.952
Don't laugh. It was a pit gnarf.

08:42.456 --> 08:44.289
Uh, could this be it?

Oh, yeah, that's it.

08:45.492 --> 08:48.527
"The Furry Home Companion."

08:48.529 --> 08:51.463
Well, isn't that a little bit
thin for an encyclopedia?

08:51.465 --> 08:53.398
Our bodies
aren't that complicated.

08:53.400 --> 08:54.533
[hiccup]

08:54.535 --> 08:56.568
We have ten major organs.

08:56.570 --> 08:58.570

drink a glass of cat juice.

No problem.

09:17.057 --> 09:19.057
Cat juice?

09:19.059 --> 09:21.326
What is cat juice?

09:21.328 --> 09:23.328
Well, it's just
like orange juice

09:23.330 --> 09:25.363
but instead of squeezing
the juice out of an orange

09:25.365 --> 09:26.565
just squeeze the
juice out of a--

09:26.567 --> 09:28.033

Look, there's got
to be another cure.

There is, but you
don't wanna hear it.

Don't ask. Did you find a
place to have the wedding?

Oh, no, all the

10:26.593 --> 10:32.097
All-all except the
Malibu Nudist Chapel.

10:32.099 --> 10:34.899
My mother is not getting
married in a nudist colony.

10:36.103 --> 10:38.670
Well, if she does,
I'm not going.

10:38.672 --> 10:41.339
I have this tattoo
I'd rather not explain.

10:42.142 --> 10:43.642

10:43.644 --> 10:47.178
Wherever they get married,
you're not going.

is Uncle Tinkle?

11:28.689 --> 11:31.189
And cotton in our ears.

11:32.626 --> 11:35.293
Oh, my gosh.
It's my mother and Whizzer.

11:35.295 --> 11:36.861
Oh, he'll hear the hiccups.

11:36.863 --> 11:38.229
He'll find out about ALF.

11:38.231 --> 11:39.397
He will call the marriage off.

11:39.399 --> 11:40.498
My mother will be mad at me

11:40.500 --> 11:42.300
for the rest of my life.

11:43.670 --> 11:46.171
Or maybe they won't care.

11:46.173 --> 11:47.806
- Oh, hi.
- Hi, sweetheart.

11:47.808 --> 11:49.207
Hi, mom. Hi, Whizzer.
Come on in.

11:49.209 --> 11:50.475
Don't mind if we do.

11:50.477 --> 11:51.576
That is, if you
don't mind if we do.

11:51.578 --> 11:53.344
Oh, no.

11:53.346 --> 11:56.147
Hey, Whizzer,
nervous about tomorrow?

11:56.149 --> 11:59.317
How could I be nervous? I'm too
excited about my bachelor party.

11:59.319 --> 12:02.187
Well, you know,
angel, I gotta run.

12:02.189 --> 12:05.924
If you come in late for a stag
film, you can't follow the plot.

12:05.926 --> 12:08.026
After the movie, I suppose
you're gonna have

12:08.028 --> 12:09.828
a girl jump out of a cake.

12:09.830 --> 12:11.763
No, we're not gonna
waste money on a cake.

12:11.765 --> 12:14.165
We're just getting a stripper.

12:14.167 --> 12:15.533
Very frugal.

12:15.535 --> 12:17.335
I know, I think
it's Trixie something.

12:17.337 --> 12:18.503
You wanna come, Willie?

12:18.505 --> 12:19.838
Oh, uh..

12:19.840 --> 12:21.773
Not if there's not
gonna be cake.

12:21.775 --> 12:23.408
Smart move.

12:23.410 --> 12:25.410
- Just show up tomorrow.
- You too.

12:25.412 --> 12:26.444
Bye, everybody.

12:33.920 --> 12:36.755
Mom, it-it's ALF.
He has the hiccups.

12:37.791 --> 12:40.525
Aww, that's too bad.

12:40.527 --> 12:43.361
We have tried every

He may do that tomorrow
at the ceremony, Dorothy.

12:52.773 --> 12:54.272
Shoot him.

12:54.274 --> 12:56.441
Mom!

12:56.443 --> 12:59.577
Well, if he pulls that during
"Sunrise Sunset--"

12:59.579 --> 13:01.646
Well, now just-just-just
take it easy, mom.

13:01.648 --> 13:03.548
We're still, we're looking
for a cure.

13:03.550 --> 13:06.117
Other than cat juice.

13:06.119 --> 13:07.952
Cat juice?

13:07.954 --> 13:09.988
That's the cure
for hiccups on Melmac.

13:09.990 --> 13:13.458
No, we're not mashing a cat
just to cure ALF's hiccups.

13:13.460 --> 13:15.660
How about just
for a cheap thrill?

13:18.565 --> 13:21.733
Thanks a lot, you hiccupping

Yeah, well, you're a wiener.

13:29.509 --> 13:32.243
What...mom that
was a little rough.

13:32.245 --> 13:35.346
I mean, it's not ALF's fault
that he has the hiccups.

13:35.348 --> 13:37.949
Yeah, don't forget who
brought you and Whizzer

13:37.951 --> 13:39.818
together in the first place.

13:39.820 --> 13:42.287
You did, you did ALF
and I'm sorry.

13:42.289 --> 13:46.124
If it weren't for me, you'd
be spending tomorrow alone.

13:46.126 --> 13:48.827
Watching reruns of "Bonanza".

13:48.829 --> 13:51.830
You're probably right.
Again, I apologize.

13:51.832 --> 13:54.499
The high point of
your entire evening

13:54.501 --> 13:59.204
would be catching a glimpse of

13:59.206 --> 14:01.439
I said I was sorry!

14:01.441 --> 14:03.241
There's no talking to her.

14:05.178 --> 14:07.312
ALF, would you
excuse us, please?

14:07.314 --> 14:09.314
We wanna talk about
you for a moment.

14:09.316 --> 14:10.982
Well, I'm flattered.

We are not juicing a cat.

14:28.201 --> 14:30.168
Not in my blender, anyway.

14:30.170 --> 14:33.037
Well, what if we use that

- Willie!
- I-I'm sorry!

14:37.744 --> 14:41.346
Well, I don't mean a real cat.

14:41.348 --> 14:45.416
We just mix up a batch of goop
and we tell ALF it's cat juice.

14:46.319 --> 14:48.186
That's a great idea.

- Kate, what do you say?
- Well, alright.

- Fine.

Bye, uh, Trixie, was it? Yes.

23:06.586 --> 23:08.919
Garland, have a nice
time in Tijuana.

23:11.858 --> 23:15.526
Oh, guys! Have a good time
on your honeymoon.

23:15.528 --> 23:16.660
I always do.

23:16.662 --> 23:17.928
[laughing]

23:17.930 --> 23:20.364
Isn't he terrible?

23:20.366 --> 23:22.366
Listen, if you ever find
the wedding cake

23:22.368 --> 23:24.034
save us a piece.

23:24.036 --> 23:26.203
Wasn't that the-the
strangest thing?

23:26.205 --> 23:29.340
The whole cake just
disappearing like that?

'Pardon me.'

23:33.846 --> 23:36.447
Now, mommy, if you have any
questions on your honeymoon

23:36.449 --> 23:39.016
or if you just wanna talk,
you be sure to call me, okay?

23:39.018 --> 23:41.252
[laughing]

23:41.254 --> 23:43.687
So long, Dottiekins.

23:43.689 --> 23:44.855
- Oh.
- Oh, hey, don't!

23:44.857 --> 23:46.857
ALF, you're supposed
to take the rice

23:46.859 --> 23:49.727
out of the box
before you throw it.

23:49.729 --> 23:52.430
Well, next you're gonna tell me
I'm not supposed to tie a cat

23:52.432 --> 23:54.465
to the back of the car.

23:54.467 --> 23:56.467
- Lynn, go cut Lucky loose.
- Right away.
