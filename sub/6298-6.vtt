00:00.702 --> 00:01.902
<i>Previously on</i>
<i>The Borgias...</i>

00:01.970 --> 00:03.469
What of your
cardinals' fortunes?

00:03.504 --> 00:04.438
There were debts.

00:04.505 --> 00:05.705
The treasury is filling,

00:05.773 --> 00:07.674
but not to the extent
of equipping an army.

00:07.709 --> 00:09.676
Catherina Sforza gathers
allies to her daily -

00:09.711 --> 00:10.844
<i>like flies to a corpse.</i>

00:10.878 --> 00:12.446
<i>The ending will be war.</i>

00:12.480 --> 00:13.814
Well, what do you
expect me to do?

00:13.881 --> 00:15.148
Give me command!

00:15.283 --> 00:17.317
<i>A union</i>
<i>of Italian families.</i>

00:17.352 --> 00:19.152
<i>Together we would</i>
<i>be unbreakable.</i>

00:19.220 --> 00:20.621
Under you?
A woman?

00:20.655 --> 00:23.223
My hatred of the Borgia
Pope is public already.

00:23.291 --> 00:25.158
<i>Catherina Sforza's</i>
<i>son, Benito...</i>

00:25.193 --> 00:27.828
Remember this moment
as an act of mercy.

00:27.862 --> 00:29.663
<i>This dog</i>
<i>will come back and bite.</i>

00:29.697 --> 00:30.998
Let us raise our glasses,

00:31.032 --> 00:33.233
to this family that
we welcome as our own.

00:33.301 --> 00:35.502
I have a child who
must hear those words.

00:35.536 --> 00:38.005
We would welcome any
fruit of your union.

00:38.072 --> 00:40.173
All other fruit
is best forgotten.

00:40.241 --> 00:41.708
<i>Should I bring my child</i>

00:41.743 --> 00:43.543
<i>to this theatre of cruelty?</i>

00:43.611 --> 00:44.978
No!

00:45.013 --> 00:47.053
Well, as least now, my lady,
the choice is your own.

00:47.081 --> 00:49.483
Your Highness.

00:49.550 --> 00:51.852
This king desires
more than Naples.

00:51.886 --> 00:54.254
He has an equal
fondness for Milan.

00:54.355 --> 00:55.889
<i>You need a well-born bride.</i>

00:55.990 --> 00:57.190
The least of my needs.

00:57.258 --> 00:58.925
What I need most
of all, Cardinal,

00:58.993 --> 01:00.994
is an army that can
cut through Italy.

01:01.029 --> 01:02.496
What you propose

01:02.530 --> 01:05.732
could shake the foundations
of the Italian city states.

01:05.833 --> 01:07.701
But it would
give you Milan.

01:07.735 --> 01:09.703
And it would
give you an army.

Here we are.
Here.

04:50.757 --> 04:53.159
You have suffered your
mother's absence for too long.

04:53.227 --> 04:54.427
Come.

04:54.461 --> 04:57.964
Hush now, you will be
with her in a minute.

05:37.604 --> 05:39.305
My lady.

05:40.707 --> 05:42.541
There will be
no more barriers

05:42.609 --> 05:44.977
to a mother's
affection for her son.

05:45.012 --> 05:46.379
None.

06:04.464 --> 06:12.738
[♪]

06:12.806 --> 06:18.144
Next year, the year
of Our Lord 1500,

06:18.178 --> 06:23.683
will be a year of Jubilee,
Jubilate, Jubilation.

06:23.750 --> 06:26.018
And we would have it
be the greatest,

06:26.053 --> 06:27.687
the most glorious,

06:27.754 --> 06:30.156
the holiest year of Jubilee

06:30.190 --> 06:33.225
in the history of our
Holy Mother Church.

06:33.360 --> 06:38.331
And we look to you,
our cardinals,

06:38.398 --> 06:41.233
to ensure its success.

06:42.936 --> 06:46.105
We are putting on
a show here.

06:55.349 --> 06:58.751
Pilgrims will be
flocking to Rome

06:58.785 --> 07:02.355
from all over Christendom.

07:02.422 --> 07:05.424
And we would create
in our St. Peter's

07:05.459 --> 07:09.061
a spectacle of
such magnificence

07:09.096 --> 07:12.765
to satisfy the universal
longing for salvation.

07:12.799 --> 07:15.234
For example, the Shroud
which bears the imprint

07:15.268 --> 07:16.736
of Our Saviour's face-

07:16.770 --> 07:19.105
Is in Constantinople,
Holiness.

07:19.239 --> 07:21.774
Ah, but must it remain there?

07:21.808 --> 07:23.242
In the absence
of your Holiness's

07:23.310 --> 07:26.112
Great Turkish crusade,
I'm afraid it must, yes.

07:26.146 --> 07:27.980
Oh, well, there
must be others.

07:28.081 --> 07:29.915
Relics which have
touched upon the lives

07:29.950 --> 07:32.084
and bodies of our
beloved saints,

07:32.119 --> 07:35.788
oratorios celebrating the life
of our most blessed Saviour,

07:35.889 --> 07:38.424
hymns yet to be written.

07:38.458 --> 07:42.895
We will provide
the spectacle

07:42.929 --> 07:47.967
and the pilgrim
who kneels in awe

07:48.101 --> 07:49.502
will be more likely

07:49.569 --> 07:53.572
to contribute generously
to St. Peter's pence.

07:53.607 --> 07:54.907
Ah.

07:54.941 --> 07:56.108
<i>We await</i>

07:56.143 --> 07:59.178
your suggestions
with anticipation.

08:46.193 --> 08:48.527
No further, my lady!

08:48.628 --> 08:50.496
Plague lives
in this rag!

08:58.705 --> 09:00.973
Back away now.

09:01.007 --> 09:03.108
God preserve you.

09:08.448 --> 09:21.794
[♪]

09:21.796 --> 09:30.769
[♪]

09:30.771 --> 09:38.477
[♪]

10:26.593 --> 10:29.028
Your Holiness?
Yes.

10:29.062 --> 10:31.697
You asked for ideas.

10:31.731 --> 10:33.232
Oh, yes,
we did indeed.

10:33.266 --> 10:34.800
Well, this idea
is not mine;

10:34.868 --> 10:37.436
it was your predecessor's,
Pope Innocent's.

10:37.470 --> 10:38.737
God rest his soul.

10:38.872 --> 10:41.273
Pope Innocent's
proposition was...

10:41.308 --> 10:42.875
a bank of sinners.

10:42.909 --> 10:46.579
Oh, yes.
We remember his idea.

10:46.613 --> 10:49.481
We opposed it
at the time.

10:49.583 --> 10:51.584
I see.

10:51.651 --> 10:54.019
But, rather
than repentance

10:54.054 --> 10:57.890
by means of prayer, penance,
fasting, flagellation,

10:57.958 --> 11:02.861
the sinner would pay for his
or her forgiveness in coin.

11:02.896 --> 11:06.699
Gold, silver,
promissory notes.

11:06.766 --> 11:08.367
Hm...

11:08.401 --> 11:10.069
The liar,
for example,

11:10.170 --> 11:13.672
would pay more
than the fornicator,

11:13.707 --> 11:15.841
less in turn
than the usurer,

11:15.875 --> 11:18.243
the usurer would pay
less than the murderer,

11:18.378 --> 11:20.412
and so on and so on.

11:20.547 --> 11:23.782
A sinner saved
is a sinner saved.

11:23.883 --> 11:25.351
In the coming Jubilee year,

11:25.385 --> 11:29.355
Rome will be flooded with
pilgrims, penitents -

11:29.422 --> 11:31.724
all sinners.

11:31.791 --> 11:34.560
All thronging
the confessionals

11:34.594 --> 11:38.130
for their share
of Heavenly grace.

11:38.198 --> 11:39.365
The simple expedient

11:39.399 --> 11:42.434
of a coin box outside
each confessional

11:42.569 --> 11:44.937
may make the process
manageable.

11:46.239 --> 11:48.340
We will consider it.

11:49.476 --> 11:50.976
Your Holiness.

11:52.579 --> 11:55.014
Your devotion is noted.

12:02.555 --> 12:04.923
<i>Vitelli.</i>

12:04.991 --> 12:08.394
Why ask to meet me here,
the middle of nowhere?

12:08.428 --> 12:09.895
Neutral ground.

12:11.798 --> 12:15.267
Neither Rome nor Forli?

12:15.335 --> 12:17.069
Near La Spezia.

12:18.104 --> 12:20.172
So...

12:20.306 --> 12:22.574
Surprise me
with what you want.

12:22.642 --> 12:24.510
Your allegiance.

12:24.577 --> 12:27.646
And that of the
Orsini, Baglioni.

12:27.681 --> 12:29.348
And why would I
give you that?

12:29.449 --> 12:31.650
The pope will not even give
you full charge of his army.

12:33.586 --> 12:34.620
Come.

12:43.830 --> 12:46.231
France did me some
favours, my lord.

12:52.605 --> 12:54.006
Why would I need
my father's army

12:54.107 --> 12:56.475
when I have
one of my own?

12:56.509 --> 13:03.148
[♪]

13:11.191 --> 13:14.126
Holiness...

13:14.160 --> 13:16.995
Observe our
new bees, Cardinal Sforza.

13:17.030 --> 13:20.566
However far they swarm
in search of pollen-

13:20.667 --> 13:24.570
they always return,
with their bounty -

13:25.872 --> 13:27.339
to the hive.

13:27.373 --> 13:33.746
Like the pilgrims of
Christendom, flocking to Rome.

13:33.847 --> 13:36.081
They are not the only
ones flocking to Rome.

13:37.217 --> 13:40.586
There are also the Jews.

13:40.687 --> 13:43.155
Ah, good.

13:43.223 --> 13:44.523
The Jews?

13:44.557 --> 13:46.525
Yes, from Constantinople.

13:46.559 --> 13:48.327
More of them come
every day.

13:48.394 --> 13:51.663
Hm. Begging for trading
rights within the city walls.

13:51.698 --> 13:53.098
<i>Indeed.</i>

13:59.205 --> 14:01.106
Taste that, Cardinal.

14:03.009 --> 14:04.743
Vatican honey.

14:07.280 --> 14:09.214
How is it?

14:11.217 --> 14:12.918
Marvellous,
Your Holiness.

14:14.354 --> 14:16.288
Tell us.

14:16.356 --> 14:18.957
At present,
how stand the taxes,

14:19.058 --> 14:23.395
particularly the taxes from
the merchant guilds of Rome?

14:23.463 --> 14:26.598
Mm...
they are somewhat...

14:26.699 --> 14:27.933
in arrears.

14:27.967 --> 14:29.368
By how much?

14:31.137 --> 14:32.771
<i>You can see</i>
<i>for yourself.</i>

14:43.716 --> 14:45.284
Mm...

14:58.665 --> 15:00.966
Let us meet
with the Jews.

15:23.623 --> 15:26.592
A message for
the Borgia Pope.

15:27.760 --> 15:29.394
My lord.

15:46.779 --> 15:50.482
[♪]

15:55.488 --> 15:57.488
So you were
driven out of Constantinople

15:57.490 --> 15:59.258
by the Turks.

15:59.325 --> 16:00.659
We too have issues
with the Turks.

16:00.693 --> 16:02.027
We have...

16:02.095 --> 16:03.862
...taken it
upon ourselves

16:03.963 --> 16:07.132
to rid the civilized
world of their presence.

16:07.200 --> 16:10.869
A great and glorious Crusade
against the Infidel.

16:10.970 --> 16:14.806
A Crusade which must
necessarily benefit you.

16:16.809 --> 16:18.677
A Crusade
follows a Christian cross,

16:18.778 --> 16:20.045
Your Excellency.

16:20.146 --> 16:22.614
We Jews have no business
with a Crusade.

16:22.649 --> 16:25.817
But Rome follows
a Christian cross,

16:25.852 --> 16:29.855
and you Jews would do
business with Rome.

16:32.825 --> 16:38.897
We offer you a home,
a place to prosper,

16:38.998 --> 16:42.000
and the opportunity
to contribute

16:42.035 --> 16:43.635
to the downfall
of your enemies.

16:43.670 --> 16:45.003
<i>I must see the pope!</i>

16:45.038 --> 16:46.171
And in return,

16:46.205 --> 16:49.174
what could we
poor merchants offer you?

16:50.643 --> 16:53.045
Not so poor, I suspect.

16:53.079 --> 16:56.882
A fair price for trading
within Rome's walls,

16:56.983 --> 17:00.485
a small contribution
towards our Holy Crusade,

17:00.520 --> 17:06.191
and a tithe towards next
year's Holy Year of Jubilee.

17:06.224 --> 17:07.659
You ask for much.

17:07.694 --> 17:09.027
As do you.

17:09.061 --> 17:11.663
Or would you rather
return to Constantinople?

17:11.698 --> 17:13.665
This matter
cannot wait, Your Holiness.

17:18.070 --> 17:19.704
The French army has
landed at Liguria.

17:19.739 --> 17:21.606
What?

17:23.076 --> 17:25.210
Let us know your decision.

17:25.243 --> 17:26.712
The French Army?

17:26.779 --> 17:28.680
They put into the port of La
Spezia under cover of darkness

17:28.715 --> 17:30.882
and have disembarked,
made their way inland.

17:30.917 --> 17:32.117
How many?

17:32.185 --> 17:33.251
Reports conflict,
Your Holiness.

17:33.286 --> 17:34.886
Some say ten thousand,
some say more.

17:34.921 --> 17:36.221
Are they heading
south towards Rome?

17:36.255 --> 17:38.190
I don't know,
Holiness.

17:38.224 --> 17:39.758
Well, you don't know much!
Forgive me, Holiness.

17:39.792 --> 17:40.959
I've -

17:41.027 --> 17:43.095
Summon all the generals
of the papal armies.

17:43.196 --> 17:44.563
Go, immediately.

17:47.767 --> 17:50.402
What has he done?

17:50.436 --> 17:52.738
Has he insulted the king?

17:52.772 --> 17:55.407
Raped some poor princess?

17:55.441 --> 17:59.077
What in Heaven's name could
have brought this upon us?

17:59.112 --> 18:02.981
An entire army lands
without your knowledge?

18:03.049 --> 18:04.416
King Louis of France

18:04.450 --> 18:07.619
invades our shores
without your knowledge?

18:07.653 --> 18:09.654
And without our permission!

18:09.756 --> 18:11.590
He has our permission.

18:12.558 --> 18:14.626
Holiness.

18:18.731 --> 18:21.767
Allow me to present
the Archbishop of Rouen.

18:21.801 --> 18:23.935
I have taken the liberty

18:24.003 --> 18:26.004
of pledging to him
a cardinal's hat

18:26.105 --> 18:28.774
as acknowledgment of
the continuing amity

18:28.808 --> 18:30.108
between France and Rome.

18:30.143 --> 18:33.645
Your Holiness, gentlemen,
Cardinal D'Amboise.

18:36.983 --> 18:38.850
Your Holiness.

18:41.521 --> 18:43.855
Très honoré.

18:50.997 --> 18:53.298
Give me joy of
my marriage, Father.

18:53.332 --> 18:55.200
I am an honest man
at last.

18:56.636 --> 18:58.470
What do you say
to this army?

19:00.273 --> 19:03.208
The French army that
has landed in Liguria

19:03.309 --> 19:05.811
has done so with
my permission,

19:05.845 --> 19:07.212
and is under my command.

19:07.313 --> 19:08.647
With your permission?

19:08.681 --> 19:10.382
In your name, Father.

19:10.450 --> 19:12.050
We gave you no
such dispensation.

19:12.151 --> 19:14.152
You told me to ensure
the safety of Rome.

19:14.187 --> 19:15.654
You told me, moreover,

19:15.688 --> 19:19.191
that there were no limits to
the extent of my negotiations.

19:19.225 --> 19:21.226
I took you at your word.

19:21.327 --> 19:22.561
I bring you an army.

19:22.628 --> 19:24.029
Out! Out! Out! OUT!

19:24.163 --> 19:25.964
Go!
All of you.

19:31.037 --> 19:33.238
All of you.

19:51.824 --> 19:54.993
So, you
appoint cardinals now?

19:55.027 --> 19:56.695
In your name, Father.

19:57.597 --> 20:00.232
He is most likely
spying for King Louis,

20:00.333 --> 20:03.034
but at least he is where
we can keep watch on him.

20:03.069 --> 20:06.004
You would bring an
army into our land.

20:06.038 --> 20:07.873
An army that
answers to me alone.

20:07.940 --> 20:10.075
But we have our own army.

20:11.878 --> 20:14.779
Ill equipped, ill funded,
spread thin, unprepared.

20:17.416 --> 20:20.719
My army stands four
days' march from Milan,

20:20.786 --> 20:24.189
and Milan is not
ready for me.

20:24.257 --> 20:26.591
I propose that I ride north.

20:26.726 --> 20:29.427
That I rally Italian
families to my cause.

20:29.562 --> 20:32.264
That I overthrow the
tyrant Ludovico Sforza.

20:32.365 --> 20:33.431
That I take Milan...

20:33.533 --> 20:34.966
In the name of King
Louis of France!

20:35.067 --> 20:36.968
before Catherina
Sforza even realizes

20:37.069 --> 20:39.404
that the fight has
come to her doorstep.

20:40.907 --> 20:43.909
You would give away cities
as if you were playing cards?

20:43.943 --> 20:45.610
I would eliminate
the Sforza dynasty.

20:47.613 --> 20:49.247
Ludovico, first.

20:49.382 --> 20:52.918
And it need not trouble
the papal armies one iota.

20:52.985 --> 20:54.286
Then, Catherina.

20:54.320 --> 20:57.756
But to have the French
in Milan was not our design.

20:57.790 --> 20:58.990
No.

20:59.091 --> 21:00.425
But it was the only design
that ensured success.

21:00.459 --> 21:03.562
And you told me to secure
our every advantage.

21:03.629 --> 21:06.331
And I have done so.

21:06.399 --> 21:08.433
I brought you
an army, Father.

21:08.467 --> 21:10.502
Would you have me
send it back?

21:14.574 --> 21:15.574
Doors.

21:18.911 --> 21:20.946
<i>Ride north, Cesare.</i>

21:23.482 --> 21:26.017
That is our command.

21:42.735 --> 21:45.437
You spoke out of turn.

21:45.504 --> 21:47.572
They will throw us
back to Kefalonia.

21:47.607 --> 21:49.074
I'm well aware of that.

21:49.108 --> 21:51.142
But I think I can
read that Alexander;

21:51.177 --> 21:52.344
I know what he wants.

21:52.445 --> 21:55.280
The Holy Crusade
against the Turks

21:55.314 --> 21:57.148
requires coin.

21:57.283 --> 21:59.784
That is what he wants.

21:59.919 --> 22:02.854
What coin do we have?

22:02.922 --> 22:05.857
He already looks to drain us
bloodless with his taxation!

22:05.925 --> 22:08.760
Yes, yes, yes, so we
must convince him not to.

22:08.794 --> 22:10.362
Think!

22:15.501 --> 22:18.303
What do we have
that they do not?

22:19.472 --> 22:23.174
- The Spear of Longinus.
- Yes.

22:23.276 --> 22:24.809
The spear that
pierced Christ's side

22:24.944 --> 22:26.278
while he was upon
the cross?

22:26.312 --> 22:27.712
The same.

22:28.881 --> 22:30.815
But...

22:30.883 --> 22:32.117
it has been lost
for centuries.

22:32.184 --> 22:33.952
No, not lost.

22:33.986 --> 22:37.055
Kept. Hidden.
Safe.

22:43.195 --> 22:46.498
A secret
known only to the Jews.

23:13.025 --> 23:15.093
So the king died.

23:15.194 --> 23:17.195
Most horribly.

23:17.229 --> 23:18.563
And you have your son back.

23:18.698 --> 23:20.031
Well, for now -

23:20.099 --> 23:21.933
until the new king
is crowned.

23:22.001 --> 23:24.336
There are several
claimants, I've heard.

23:24.370 --> 23:25.937
Is your Alfonso among them?

23:26.038 --> 23:29.374
There are two in
line before him.

23:29.442 --> 23:31.276
Did you marry
the wrong man, Sis?

23:31.377 --> 23:33.545
Of course.
Is it not my habit?

23:37.083 --> 23:38.750
If I married
a thousand times,

23:38.851 --> 23:40.385
it would always be
the wrong choice.

23:43.122 --> 23:46.458
And you, Brother, did you
marry the wrong woman?

23:46.525 --> 23:51.096
Of course, but she is
beautiful and cultivated.

23:51.130 --> 23:54.032
And came with an army,
I am told.

23:54.066 --> 23:56.534
France gave me the army.
Ah!

23:58.671 --> 24:00.438
The same which
devastated the lands

24:00.506 --> 24:02.307
that I have moved to.

24:02.341 --> 24:04.442
Are you
sure about this?

24:04.510 --> 24:06.211
Now you take
issue with me.

24:06.312 --> 24:07.679
Just like our father?

24:07.713 --> 24:10.415
Well, neither of us
likes surprises.

24:10.449 --> 24:13.418
A father may
forget that one day

24:13.452 --> 24:15.253
his son will
follow his example,

24:15.287 --> 24:17.689
not his advice.

24:17.757 --> 24:19.891
My darling brother,

24:19.959 --> 24:21.893
in whom politics,
stratagem,

24:21.994 --> 24:24.662
and affection
are always linked.

24:24.764 --> 24:26.464
Not unlike my sister.

24:30.503 --> 24:32.470
My, how
beautiful you are.

24:32.505 --> 24:33.972
<i>I love</i>
<i>my husband, Cesare,</i>

24:34.073 --> 24:36.141
however difficult
it has been.

24:36.242 --> 24:38.676
Do you love
your wife?

24:38.778 --> 24:43.114
Love is not an issue
between us.

24:43.149 --> 24:45.617
There is none other
like you.

24:45.684 --> 24:49.854
Well, then,
promise me

24:49.922 --> 24:52.690
that you will
return victorious

24:52.792 --> 24:55.260
and that your
French engagement

24:55.294 --> 24:57.295
will never put my
marriage in danger.

24:58.998 --> 25:02.300
Your marriage to Naples?

25:02.334 --> 25:05.336
My marriage
to my husband-

25:05.471 --> 25:07.839
who is of Naples.

25:11.477 --> 25:14.646
This is a love which
our parents will never allow!

25:14.680 --> 25:17.148
Such is the tragedy
of our love!

25:26.459 --> 25:37.702
[♪]

25:41.907 --> 25:44.342
What is this?

25:44.410 --> 25:47.345
A message from Lady
Catherina Sforza of Forli

25:47.480 --> 25:51.082
to His Holiness Pope
Alexander Sextus of Rome.

25:51.183 --> 25:54.252
Treating for peace.
Peace?

25:54.353 --> 25:56.654
I wasn't aware
we were at war.

25:56.689 --> 25:59.257
For a continued peace,
my lord.

26:01.093 --> 26:02.594
Burn it.

26:02.661 --> 26:04.896
Ah, my -
my lord -

26:04.997 --> 26:06.664
Catherina Sforza
has no more interest

26:06.699 --> 26:08.867
in suing for peace
than I do.

26:08.901 --> 26:12.270
She seeks to sow confusion,
cloud our mind with doubt.

26:12.371 --> 26:14.038
She thinks a pope
who seeks for peace

26:14.073 --> 26:16.207
will not ready
himself for war.

26:16.275 --> 26:18.376
This is a bluff.

26:19.678 --> 26:20.879
Iis-is that not

26:21.013 --> 26:22.347
for His Holiness
to decide, my lord?

26:22.381 --> 26:24.015
I would not have

26:24.049 --> 26:25.683
His Holiness's judgment in
the matter tainted one jot

26:25.751 --> 26:28.953
with Catherina Sforza's
poisoned words.

26:28.988 --> 26:30.388
Burn it.

26:47.573 --> 26:49.407
Your Eminence.

26:49.508 --> 26:51.042
Burn it.

26:52.711 --> 26:54.679
Burn it!

26:56.148 --> 26:58.049
As you wish.

27:04.557 --> 27:06.357
Oh, wait!

27:06.458 --> 27:08.192
Wait.

27:09.495 --> 27:12.163
We should at least
preserve the box.

27:16.969 --> 27:18.202
It is exquisite.

27:18.304 --> 27:20.505
Yes, your Eminence.

28:07.920 --> 28:09.220
More wine.

28:27.239 --> 28:28.406
Your choice
of drinking halls

28:28.440 --> 28:31.242
has fallen off of late,
Vitelezzo.

28:31.276 --> 28:33.578
The wine may have
little to recommend it,

28:33.712 --> 28:36.080
but the location does.

28:36.115 --> 28:37.882
Halfway
from Milan to Forli?

28:37.916 --> 28:40.418
Convenient
for all of us.

28:40.452 --> 28:42.320
Are you sure
this intrigue of yours

28:42.421 --> 28:45.323
is convenient for
all of us, Vitelezzo?

28:45.391 --> 28:47.425
Judge for yourself.

28:47.493 --> 28:52.096
We threw the papal armies in
his face, called his bluff.

28:52.131 --> 28:54.065
And now he has an
army of his own.

28:54.099 --> 28:56.734
As does Catherina.

28:56.769 --> 28:58.336
The scales balance.

28:58.437 --> 29:00.738
For the moment,
perhaps.

29:00.773 --> 29:03.608
But what of us?

29:03.642 --> 29:07.078
Our men, united under
a common banner,

29:07.112 --> 29:10.448
would tip the scales one way
or another, would they not?

29:10.482 --> 29:13.918
So, do we toss a coin?

29:13.986 --> 29:16.087
There is Rome.

29:16.155 --> 29:17.922
There, Forli.

29:20.159 --> 29:23.961
Now, I tell you plain, I care
little for the Borgia Pope.

29:24.096 --> 29:26.464
But I have looked
his son in the eye,

29:26.498 --> 29:30.268
and I have seen his army massing
on the quay in La Spezia,

29:30.335 --> 29:32.170
and this much is plain:

29:32.271 --> 29:34.939
Rome is no longer
the Borgia Pope alone.

29:34.973 --> 29:39.477
Rome is Cesare Borgia also.

29:39.511 --> 29:44.649
And that in all truth, is a
fight I have no stomach for.

29:51.156 --> 29:54.058
So?
Do you ride with me?

29:54.126 --> 29:56.360
There was talk of an army.

30:12.144 --> 30:14.278
This is just
a small fraction

30:14.313 --> 30:18.282
of the army already
on the march to Milan.

30:18.317 --> 30:22.453
You are all second sons.
Bastard sons.

30:22.521 --> 30:25.623
With fathers who deny you
your rightful estates.

30:25.657 --> 30:29.794
I offer you a chance
to carve out your own fate.

30:29.828 --> 30:32.663
To damn your fathers
to the past -

30:32.698 --> 30:34.499
or to hell.

30:36.235 --> 30:39.704
Ride with me,
my bastard army,

30:42.341 --> 30:44.709
to the only future allowed us.

30:46.712 --> 30:49.013
<i>Soldiers! Move!</i>

30:56.688 --> 30:58.523
Shall we drink?

31:00.559 --> 31:02.527
To the bastards!

31:02.661 --> 31:04.028
Speak for yourself!

31:04.062 --> 31:07.532
To the bastards!

31:07.666 --> 31:08.766
To us!

31:08.834 --> 31:11.836
And the contents?

31:11.870 --> 31:15.373
An earnest
supplication of peace.

31:15.407 --> 31:18.442
Even as we tremble
on the brink ow war,

31:18.544 --> 31:21.012
and a supplication intended
for the pope alone.

31:22.447 --> 31:23.915
This is dangerous.

31:24.016 --> 31:25.349
Well, perhaps.

31:25.384 --> 31:27.852
But, also an opportunity?

31:29.254 --> 31:31.389
A lever.

31:31.423 --> 31:33.191
Cesare Borgia
seeks to suppress

31:33.225 --> 31:34.725
the one piece of news

31:34.760 --> 31:37.361
which could entirely alter the
tapestry of politics in Italy.

31:37.396 --> 31:39.864
Why?

31:39.898 --> 31:41.465
Why?

31:41.567 --> 31:43.801
Does it matter?

31:43.902 --> 31:46.270
He seeks to suppress it.

31:46.371 --> 31:49.106
To keep it from his father.

31:49.208 --> 31:52.610
Well, whatever their
personal enmities may be,

31:52.644 --> 31:55.279
this is treason,
is it not?

31:57.749 --> 32:01.452
And I command the one
piece of evidence.

32:05.090 --> 32:07.258
May it benefit you.

32:07.292 --> 32:08.993
I'm sure it will.

32:16.301 --> 32:19.003
The Spear of Longinus?

32:19.104 --> 32:21.005
It has touched the very
blood of your Christ.

32:21.106 --> 32:22.406
You know where it is?

32:22.441 --> 32:26.244
It sat deep beneath Jerusalem,
buried, for centuries.

32:26.278 --> 32:29.614
It was moved, with our tribe,
to Constantinople.

32:29.648 --> 32:31.649
It travels with us.

32:31.783 --> 32:33.184
We keep it hidden.

32:33.252 --> 32:35.753
For events of great import.

32:35.787 --> 32:37.188
Portent.

32:37.289 --> 32:39.802
Such as our imminent
entry into Rome.

32:39.827 --> 32:41.827
Yes.

32:41.994 --> 32:45.763
We poor Jews have little
in the way of coin,

32:45.797 --> 32:48.032
<i>but we are rich in history,</i>

32:48.133 --> 32:50.835
and we would like to show our
gratitude to Your Holiness

32:50.936 --> 32:52.803
in whichever way God allows.

32:52.838 --> 32:54.138
If...

32:54.172 --> 32:56.173
We can gain entry
into Rome.

32:59.044 --> 33:01.379
Can you send it
to us here?

33:01.480 --> 33:07.018
It is already on its way,
Your Holiness.

33:07.052 --> 33:09.987
I could gift it
to you if...

33:12.224 --> 33:14.558
We understand.

33:14.626 --> 33:18.162
We will have a
relevant Bull drawn up.

33:18.196 --> 33:20.998
And on receipt of the
Spear of Longinus,

33:21.033 --> 33:23.234
you and your people
will be welcome

33:23.335 --> 33:25.569
to make your homes
here in Rome.

33:25.637 --> 33:28.406
Your Excellency's
generosity knows no bounds.

33:32.711 --> 33:34.745
It's good to see that at
least one of our cardinals

33:34.813 --> 33:37.581
takes our purposes
so closely to heart.

33:37.683 --> 33:39.517
Thank you, Holiness.

33:39.584 --> 33:42.019
That Cardinal
Farnese will go far.

33:42.054 --> 33:43.854
Indeed.

33:48.994 --> 33:50.928
<i>Forward!</i>
<i>Keep up at the back!</i>

34:00.005 --> 34:01.339
<i>Yah! Yah!</i>

34:02.774 --> 34:05.076
An army!
We're under attack!

34:05.143 --> 34:06.610
That way!

34:07.846 --> 34:09.380
<i>Men, to your swords!</i>

34:09.414 --> 34:10.880
<i>Soldats, vos épées!</i>

34:29.434 --> 34:30.900
Get me my horse.

34:44.750 --> 34:46.617
<i>Make way!</i>

34:46.717 --> 34:48.252
<i>Move.</i>

34:58.363 --> 35:00.464
<i>Hold the line!</i>

35:44.443 --> 35:55.920
[♪]

35:59.324 --> 36:02.093
Well, well.
The Spear of Longinus.

36:02.127 --> 36:04.295
Apparently.

36:04.329 --> 36:07.298
And to quote the Holy
Father's words of approval,

36:07.332 --> 36:09.533
"That young man
will go far."

36:09.634 --> 36:12.937
Again, apparently.

36:12.971 --> 36:15.539
Do I detect a note of
irritation, Cardinal?

36:15.640 --> 36:18.175
If I may be so
precipitant, even jealousy?

36:18.276 --> 36:21.345
No, Cardinal.
Merely of caution.

36:21.446 --> 36:25.282
Jews have sold Christians
dud relics for centuries.

36:25.317 --> 36:28.119
Why, Pope Innocent was offered
the Ark of the Covenant,

36:28.153 --> 36:30.988
by an itinerant
rabbi from Salamanca.

36:31.123 --> 36:34.825
We are children to
their guile, Cardinal.

36:34.893 --> 36:38.662
Innocents, like our
saviour himself.

36:38.697 --> 36:43.300
And someone must knock this
fake antiquarian off his perch.

36:44.870 --> 36:47.872
Your Holiness, may
I present to you a treasure

36:47.906 --> 36:51.842
that we feared was lost forever
to the eyes of Christendom.

36:51.910 --> 36:55.713
The spear that touched the
blood of our Saviour himself.

36:55.747 --> 36:58.682
The Spear of Longinus.

37:10.061 --> 37:11.362
Even the wrapping,

37:11.496 --> 37:15.199
Holiness,
falls away at the touch.

37:24.042 --> 37:26.177
May we hold it?
Indeed.

37:26.211 --> 37:29.013
It has been awaiting hands
as blessed as yours.

37:31.650 --> 37:35.719
Legend has it, it sometimes
trembles to the touch.

37:35.820 --> 37:37.021
Indeed.

37:45.497 --> 37:47.531
Ah!

37:47.599 --> 37:49.133
We felt it tremble.

37:51.536 --> 37:55.439
Holiness, if I may
interrupt this sacred moment.

37:55.540 --> 37:57.675
May I also present...

37:59.244 --> 38:01.879
the Spear of Longinus.

38:03.715 --> 38:05.549
Were there two spears?

38:05.584 --> 38:08.052
Were there two Longinuses?

38:08.086 --> 38:09.853
Sadly, your Holiness,

38:09.888 --> 38:13.390
having researched the matter,
there appear to be many.

38:13.425 --> 38:18.529
One in Alexandria,
one in a monastery in Sicil-

38:18.563 --> 38:19.997
Oh?

38:20.031 --> 38:21.832
...and one was promised to your
predecessor, Pope Innocent,

38:21.866 --> 38:26.203
by a Moor fleeing from
the siege of Granada.

38:26.238 --> 38:29.373
This current
claimant to the title

38:29.407 --> 38:33.611
was found in an Etruscan
ruin north of Rome.

38:37.349 --> 38:39.950
Does it tremble
to the touch?

38:41.720 --> 38:44.388
It can be made to.

38:48.426 --> 38:51.061
Would your cardinal
be so kind?

38:56.735 --> 38:59.069
It looks authentic.

38:59.204 --> 39:01.805
It feels authentic.

39:01.906 --> 39:05.242
But as to the tremulation...

39:07.746 --> 39:08.979
there is none.

39:11.449 --> 39:13.917
And there is fresh sap,

39:13.952 --> 39:17.554
I see,
oozing from the wood.

39:17.589 --> 39:20.624
This wood was cut from
a Roman beech tree,

39:20.759 --> 39:24.995
I would hazard,
within a month past.

39:25.096 --> 39:29.400
Are there beeches
in the Holy Land?

39:29.434 --> 39:32.636
No, Cardinal,
there are not,

39:32.671 --> 39:35.572
there are cedars
in the Holy Land.

39:35.607 --> 39:36.473
Yews.

39:36.574 --> 39:39.610
There are no beeches.

39:39.644 --> 39:42.613
But we thank you,
Cardinal,

39:42.647 --> 39:47.184
for proving the authenticity
of the real Spear of Longinus,

39:47.285 --> 39:50.020
which we will
present to the world

39:50.121 --> 39:52.589
when we break down
the doors of St. Peter's

39:52.624 --> 39:54.591
at the beginning of
next year's Jubilee!

39:55.994 --> 39:59.296
And you, Cardinal,

39:59.331 --> 40:04.468
may consign this piece
of pretend relic

40:04.602 --> 40:09.306
to the trove of forgeries
from which you found it.

40:35.500 --> 40:37.968
My Lord Sforza?

40:41.373 --> 40:43.340
My mother was right.

40:45.510 --> 40:48.145
Come tomorrow's dawn

40:48.179 --> 40:50.147
there will be
rivers of blood.

40:53.718 --> 40:55.519
What now?

40:57.722 --> 40:59.356
I've seen enough.

41:08.767 --> 41:15.873
[♪]

41:15.940 --> 41:18.542
Tomorrow...

41:18.576 --> 41:21.879
our fathers will know
our place in history.

41:28.420 --> 41:29.720
Until tomorrow.

41:29.754 --> 41:32.055
Tomorrow!

41:36.928 --> 41:48.705
[♪]

41:48.740 --> 41:50.541
When we take
Milan, my brother,

41:50.575 --> 41:52.242
we'll see who's
the better fighter.

41:54.112 --> 41:55.145
<i>Are we ready?</i>

41:55.246 --> 41:56.747
<i>Soon my lord.</i>

41:57.949 --> 41:59.883
How long to pull the
cannon into place?

41:59.918 --> 42:01.385
Four hours.

42:01.419 --> 42:03.253
And not one living
soul gets in or out.

42:03.288 --> 42:04.254
<i>Of course.</i>

42:04.389 --> 42:06.390
My lord -
you must come see.

42:06.424 --> 42:16.500
[♪]

42:19.270 --> 42:21.338
The gates are open, my lord.

42:21.439 --> 42:24.274
The city looks unguarded.

42:28.746 --> 42:37.154
[♪]

42:59.210 --> 43:01.812
<i>Mama, Mama!</i>

43:01.846 --> 43:15.158
[♪]

43:15.160 --> 43:24.668
[♪]

43:24.670 --> 43:32.276
[♪]

43:42.453 --> 43:45.989
Welcome to Milan,
my lord.

43:46.057 --> 43:48.725
Where's Ludovico Sforza?

43:48.826 --> 43:50.527
Where's Il Moro?
Where's the duke?

43:50.628 --> 43:52.429
Gone, my lord.

43:52.530 --> 43:54.531
And his army?

43:54.599 --> 43:56.366
<i>Gone with him.</i>

43:58.369 --> 44:01.171
What's this
molten thing?

44:01.205 --> 44:03.807
It was a
bronze horse once.

44:03.841 --> 44:05.909
Ten houses high.

44:05.977 --> 44:07.177
Designed by Leonardo -

44:07.312 --> 44:08.345
<i>Da Vinci -</i>

44:08.413 --> 44:10.480
The duke had it
melted down for cannon

44:10.548 --> 44:13.350
then abandoned the cannon
and rode off into the hills.

44:13.484 --> 44:15.419
<i>The French King</i>
<i>would meet with Leonardo.</i>

44:15.486 --> 44:17.554
If he can find him.

44:17.655 --> 44:19.423
Da Vinci is gone too.

44:20.925 --> 44:22.192
<i>We have Milan, my lord.</i>

44:22.260 --> 44:23.927
No, the French have Milan.

44:24.028 --> 44:26.363
And Ludovico Sforza lives
to fight another day

44:26.397 --> 44:28.565
and he has a rightful
claim to Naples.

44:28.666 --> 44:30.033
DAMN HIM!

44:42.547 --> 44:46.450
So...

44:48.052 --> 44:50.387
you say it trembles.

44:52.557 --> 44:54.057
Hm?

44:54.092 --> 44:56.793
So legend has it,
Your Holiness.

44:56.861 --> 44:58.061
Ah.

44:59.931 --> 45:05.068
Or does it just
seem to tremble?

45:07.905 --> 45:09.873
Hm.

45:11.809 --> 45:13.110
No, Your Holiness!

45:17.949 --> 45:19.883
The judgement of Solomon.

45:25.289 --> 45:30.460
I think we will have to
make do with "seems," hm?

45:36.501 --> 45:41.238
Our Holy Mother Church
is driven by belief.

45:41.272 --> 45:46.276
And we choose to believe that
this is the Spear of Longinus

45:46.310 --> 45:48.078
so that you and your tribe

45:48.112 --> 45:51.615
may make your lives
here, in Rome.

46:00.792 --> 46:06.463
Now, what other gifts
do you have to bring us?

46:20.478 --> 46:22.446
Stefano!

46:26.017 --> 46:27.984
Stefano, I need you!

46:33.191 --> 46:34.791
Stefano!

46:36.027 --> 46:37.327
Stefano!

46:37.361 --> 46:39.329
Do not enter,
<i>Your Eminence.</i>

46:39.397 --> 46:40.831
I've been calling -

46:42.166 --> 46:45.168
Are you sick?
What's the matter?

46:45.203 --> 46:47.571
<i>I am</i>
<i>burning up with fever.</i>

46:48.639 --> 46:50.173
Plague!

46:52.510 --> 46:54.578
Plague!
