WEBVTT

00:12.554 --> 00:13.555
<i>Who are you?</i>

00:16.391 --> 00:17.809
Come with me.

01:11.780 --> 01:14.950
You could've thrown away Petey's phone
weeks ago. Why didn't you?

01:15.033 --> 01:17.703
I'm sorry, just-- Who are you?

01:17.786 --> 01:19.621
I'm the one who helped your friend.

01:20.539 --> 01:22.916
Helped? You mean reintegration?
It killed him.

01:23.000 --> 01:25.002
The procedure didn't kill Petey.

01:25.085 --> 01:27.004
If he had followed my post-op instructions

01:27.087 --> 01:29.631
and not simply run away
at the first sign of sickness--

01:29.715 --> 01:31.341
So, you-- You're a doctor?

01:33.594 --> 01:35.429
I put that chip in your head,

01:35.512 --> 01:38.098
and I'm still the only one
who can deactivate it.

01:46.648 --> 01:48.483
Maybe I don't want it deactivated.

01:49.151 --> 01:52.070
Right. Well, maybe your innie does.

01:52.738 --> 01:56.533
You wonder what he thinks about all this,
don't you? You wonder if he's happy?

01:57.284 --> 02:00.537
I hate that term, "innie."
So infantilizing.

02:01.663 --> 02:04.291
Then again, you've been severed
for two years, right?

02:04.374 --> 02:06.668
So your innie really is still just a baby.

02:08.211 --> 02:13.717
My innie lives his own life and,
as a result, I get to live mine.

02:15.093 --> 02:17.721
But he only exists because of you.

02:17.804 --> 02:20.933
And for all intents and purposes,
he is you.

02:23.810 --> 02:25.854
Do you really think
he's different down there?

02:26.688 --> 02:29.650
Combs his hair differently,
laughs at different jokes?

02:30.901 --> 02:32.986
Maybe he loves it, you're right.

02:33.612 --> 02:35.030
But maybe he doesn't.

02:36.365 --> 02:40.410
Maybe he dreams every day
about clawing his way to the surface.

02:42.538 --> 02:46.875
But you wouldn't know. You'll never know.

02:49.294 --> 02:53.340
You brought him into this world
without his permission,

02:54.132 --> 02:57.553
based on your own desire
for emotional convenience.

03:01.807 --> 03:03.392
I'm not a bad person.

03:04.393 --> 03:06.645
I think you wanna do what's right.

03:08.438 --> 03:09.523
Both of you.

03:14.570 --> 03:15.737
Mr. Scout.

03:19.783 --> 03:21.118
Do I know you?

03:21.201 --> 03:24.955
We work together. Down there.

03:28.876 --> 03:31.170
You having a chat with someone, Mark?

03:34.006 --> 03:36.717
It's okay. I'm a friend.

03:38.218 --> 03:39.178
Shit!

03:40.679 --> 03:42.181
What the fuck are you doing?

03:46.226 --> 03:47.811
- Grab his arms.
- What?

03:48.645 --> 03:50.439
Come here. His arms.

03:54.943 --> 03:56.945
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

03:57.696 --> 04:00.073
Oh, fuck! Oh, my God.

04:03.619 --> 04:05.829
Fuck. Oh, God.

04:07.539 --> 04:08.624
I work with him.

04:08.707 --> 04:10.209
No, you don't.

04:11.877 --> 04:15.547
He's Doug Graner.
Head of security on the severed floor.

04:15.631 --> 04:17.298
Security? Oh, my God.

04:18.007 --> 04:20.719
Okay, I'm gonna get sick.
I need to throw up.

04:20.802 --> 04:24.223
- I'm gonna throw up right now.
- Don't! Don't! Don't!

04:24.306 --> 04:25.516
Your DNA's in that!

04:30.437 --> 04:33.774
Look, Graner's security card.

04:33.857 --> 04:36.818
Full access,
and it can't be tied to anyone.

04:36.902 --> 04:39.655
Take it to work tomorrow.
He'll know what to do.

04:40.322 --> 04:41.698
Who'll know what to do?

04:41.782 --> 04:42.950
You.

04:43.492 --> 04:48.121
Give me the phone.
Petey's phone. Give it to me.

04:48.747 --> 04:50.165
I'll take care of this.

04:51.542 --> 04:53.919
Go home, get rid of your clothes.

04:55.170 --> 04:56.171
Go now.

05:03.971 --> 05:07.015
I'll be in touch. It's gonna be okay.

05:07.099 --> 05:09.184
We'll finish what Petey started, Mark.

05:10.227 --> 05:11.895
Now get the fuck out of here!

08:09.031 --> 08:10.866
- Oh, hey.
- Hey.

08:10.949 --> 08:13.410
Just getting some water.
Do you need anything?

08:13.994 --> 08:14.995
Where were you?

08:15.829 --> 08:16.830
Who, me?

08:17.456 --> 08:18.957
- Yeah.
- Just--

08:19.041 --> 08:20.292
I heard the car.

08:22.920 --> 08:24.087
You heard a car?

08:32.554 --> 08:33.679
You're being weird.

08:36.475 --> 08:38.477
Maybe it was just a dream.

08:41.145 --> 08:43.398
I've been up for an hour,
and you weren't here.

08:48.695 --> 08:49.988
Okay, just--

08:52.074 --> 08:53.617
I'm sorry, I…

08:55.619 --> 08:58.789
I just needed to drive a little.

09:01.083 --> 09:02.209
Are you okay?

09:07.631 --> 09:11.301
Well, I mean,
this is kind of a big deal for me. And…

09:15.180 --> 09:16.890
I don't know. It's--

09:22.062 --> 09:23.272
Do you want me to go?

09:27.693 --> 09:28.694
Maybe.

09:30.779 --> 09:31.905
Maybe.

10:24.833 --> 10:26.210
Fucking shit.

10:28.754 --> 10:29.796
Mark!

10:30.422 --> 10:33.717
- Hey.
- You're out early in all this snowiness.

10:33.800 --> 10:38.180
You usually dispose of your waste
in the early afternoon.

10:38.263 --> 10:43.352
Oh, well, just
getting a head start on the day, I guess.

10:44.853 --> 10:46.396
You look troubled, Mark.

10:48.690 --> 10:53.529
Maybe we should talk later
over a nice hot cup of lavender tea?

10:54.738 --> 10:58.575
Yeah. I'm just gonna see
how the day goes, you know?

10:59.576 --> 11:03.747
Jack Frost certainly needs
some new dandruff shampoo.

12:29.666 --> 12:30.751
Burt G.

12:31.418 --> 12:34.713
Mr. Milchick. Pleasure to see you, sir.

12:34.796 --> 12:36.381
- So early.
- Please, sit.

12:36.465 --> 12:37.466
Thank you.

12:38.133 --> 12:39.676
I have something for you.

12:40.594 --> 12:43.388
The missing 7199-G.

12:43.472 --> 12:47.267
Oswald will be so delighted.
I, too, am delighted.

12:47.351 --> 12:50.103
Oh, good. Now we can focus on
the final preparations.

12:50.187 --> 12:52.189
- That we can.
- Without interruptions.

12:52.272 --> 12:54.316
- That we shall.
- Excellent.

12:58.654 --> 13:00.447
- May I?
- Yes, of course.

13:06.453 --> 13:07.538
Outstanding.

13:07.621 --> 13:08.872
- Yep.
- Wow.

13:10.290 --> 13:12.626
You've been a great leader
to this department, Burt G.

13:12.709 --> 13:13.710
Thank you.

13:13.794 --> 13:15.587
You deserve something special.

13:16.463 --> 13:20.008
Not-- Not a trip
to the break room, I hope.

13:20.092 --> 13:21.802
Yesterday was quite enough.

13:25.389 --> 13:30.477
No. No, not that. Something else.
Stay tuned.

13:38.402 --> 13:41.363
Dylan G. Good morning.

13:42.990 --> 13:44.116
What the hell was that?

13:44.658 --> 13:45.701
Walk with me.

13:49.329 --> 13:52.124
What happened last night
is called the overtime contingency.

13:52.791 --> 13:57.087
It's a safeguard we occasionally employ
to remotely awaken workers off-site.

13:57.171 --> 13:59.214
You never told us you could do that.

13:59.298 --> 14:00.757
It's for emergency use only.

14:01.592 --> 14:04.428
And I didn't consult Ms. Cobel
because she's been so stressed.

14:05.220 --> 14:08.307
The boy. Was he-- Was that my son?

14:12.561 --> 14:15.522
He'd agreed to count to a thousand,
which he then violated.

14:18.317 --> 14:22.029
I really wouldn't mention this
to your colleagues, Dylan.

14:22.696 --> 14:26.408
This OTC's pretty need-to-know.
Understand?

14:31.163 --> 14:32.497
Can you tell me his name?

14:34.958 --> 14:37.794
Not knowing is probably for the best.

14:41.006 --> 14:43.675
Hey, I know this has been a tough quarter.

14:44.426 --> 14:47.262
I'm gonna see about rustling you up
some special perks.

14:48.764 --> 14:49.932
That sound good?

14:55.437 --> 14:58.524
Good man, Dylan. Good man.

15:52.953 --> 15:55.163
Mark S. Good morning.

15:56.373 --> 15:57.374
Good morning.

16:02.129 --> 16:03.505
So, am I going to the--

16:03.589 --> 16:05.507
I'm here to escort you to your desk.

16:06.341 --> 16:07.426
New protocol.

16:09.261 --> 16:10.262
Sounds good.

16:11.388 --> 16:12.389
Lead the way.

16:55.390 --> 16:56.767
Wait, we're locked in now?

16:56.850 --> 16:59.394
I prefer the phrase, "safely situated."

17:00.187 --> 17:04.566
These doors help us to ensure you all are
tucked nicely in your work spaces.

17:04.650 --> 17:06.401
Did Mr. Graner order this?

17:08.987 --> 17:10.364
Mark S. is here.

17:10.446 --> 17:11.448
Have a seat.

17:11.990 --> 17:14.742
- I…
- Coffee. Black. I'll bring it to you.

17:15.285 --> 17:16.286
Good morning, Mark.

17:17.454 --> 17:18.955
- Morning.
- Morning.

17:20.540 --> 17:21.791
Mark, what is this?

17:26.630 --> 17:27.631
How're you doing, Irv?

17:27.714 --> 17:29.842
I'm well, thank you. I--

17:29.925 --> 17:33.262
The renovations are… very nice.

17:33.345 --> 17:34.763
Yeah.

17:34.847 --> 17:35.973
Dylan, you all right?

17:36.765 --> 17:37.975
I'm fine.

17:38.517 --> 17:42.312
That's the best you can do?
Where's the sly, profanity-laced comeback?

17:44.731 --> 17:47.860
Here you go.
Straight from the hills of Rwanda.

17:51.113 --> 17:52.114
Thanks.

17:57.411 --> 18:00.789
Hey, it's me. Don't know if you heard,
but Graner didn't come in.

18:00.873 --> 18:03.375
Everything's fine,
just wondering where you are.

18:06.837 --> 18:10.299
So I lean my upper body slightly forward,

18:10.382 --> 18:13.135
while cradling the top of the neck,
just so.

18:15.304 --> 18:19.474
Exhale softly. Just a whisper of a breeze.

18:20.225 --> 18:23.645
Then I do this, and this.

18:24.313 --> 18:29.109
Show the baby the areola, and we latch.

18:30.611 --> 18:31.862
Now you try.

18:33.155 --> 18:34.156
All right.

18:34.781 --> 18:36.825
You ready? You ready, buddy?

18:38.660 --> 18:39.703
Okay.

18:40.787 --> 18:44.541
- Yeah, expose the areola. Let her see it.
- Okay.

18:44.625 --> 18:47.961
- She's--
- There she is.

18:48.045 --> 18:51.298
- Yes, Eleanor, yes! Yes.
- Oh, my God.

18:52.216 --> 18:56.178
Baby sips, baby sips.

18:59.389 --> 19:05.270
So she goes into the airport restroom
to try to hand express.

19:06.313 --> 19:11.193
She gets into the stall, and
she's trying to do it in the toilet paper,

19:11.276 --> 19:14.112
but it's just flying everywhere.

19:14.196 --> 19:17.199
- Yes, like an angry fire hose.
- Oh, no!

19:19.159 --> 19:20.160
Stop.

19:21.245 --> 19:25.999
Oh, God. Thank you for helping me.

19:27.584 --> 19:29.336
Did you say you need to get to the store?

19:30.087 --> 19:34.591
They can do without me. I'm having fun.

19:34.675 --> 19:38.470
Besides, it's not as if you have
a fleet of nannies and manservants

19:38.554 --> 19:40.639
coming to take care of you, do you?

19:40.722 --> 19:41.723
Nope.

19:45.936 --> 19:48.230
I met this rich woman
at the birthing retreat.

19:48.814 --> 19:50.941
I guess her husband's a state senator.

19:51.024 --> 19:52.317
Oh, wow.

19:52.401 --> 19:56.780
I know, but it was weird 'cause I saw her
again at the park a few days later,

19:56.864 --> 19:59.116
and she 100% didn't remember me.

19:59.700 --> 20:01.201
What a snoot.

20:01.994 --> 20:02.995
Yeah.

20:04.621 --> 20:08.333
Like-- I don't know. This is stupid.

20:11.295 --> 20:16.049
Mark's company, Lumon, they say
that they only sever people for work.

20:16.800 --> 20:20.053
But I was thinking, what if someone--

20:21.597 --> 20:24.641
Like, what if you wanted a baby,
but you didn't wanna--

20:26.727 --> 20:27.728
I don't know.

20:30.898 --> 20:33.901
Well, I don't think
I'd remember even Clark Gable

20:33.984 --> 20:35.569
if I'd just given birth, so…

20:37.237 --> 20:38.238
Yeah.

20:43.619 --> 20:44.703
Severed.

20:46.788 --> 20:48.665
Why do you think Mark did it?

20:50.375 --> 20:53.670
Well, it was right after he lost his wife.

20:56.590 --> 20:59.676
At first, he tried to keep teaching
at the college, but he couldn't.

21:02.387 --> 21:04.139
Does he ever talk about her?

21:04.890 --> 21:06.141
Not as much as I'd wish.

21:07.976 --> 21:11.313
When my husband passed,
I thought I saw him everywhere.

21:11.396 --> 21:13.565
It was just so hard.

21:15.734 --> 21:17.736
Does Mark ever think he sees her?

21:31.500 --> 21:32.501
Hey.

21:33.544 --> 21:34.545
Hey.

21:34.628 --> 21:36.505
- I was just in the bathroom.
- Yeah?

21:36.588 --> 21:40.926
Yeah. Hey, what ever happened
to the soap labels?

21:41.802 --> 21:42.928
- The soap labels?
- Yeah.

21:43.011 --> 21:48.058
Shouldn't there be labels
on the soap dispensers saying, "soap"?

21:48.767 --> 21:49.768
There's never been that.

21:50.727 --> 21:51.937
We all know it's soap.

21:53.981 --> 21:56.233
- Seems like an O&amp;
- D question.

21:56.316 --> 21:59.987
Irv, you know we can't go anywhere.

22:00.070 --> 22:01.947
I mean, I get
that you're worried about Burt.

22:03.490 --> 22:06.994
Suppose he's being disciplined
for our visit?

22:07.077 --> 22:08.954
Suppose he is, thanks to you.

22:10.080 --> 22:12.249
If only someone had told you

22:12.332 --> 22:15.502
that going there was a shitty fucking idea
from the jump.

22:17.171 --> 22:19.298
Good day, Refiners!

22:20.299 --> 22:21.633
What's this?

22:23.343 --> 22:24.678
It's an MDE.

22:25.345 --> 22:27.222
She got to 75%?

22:32.769 --> 22:35.272
Helly R., please step forward.

22:36.982 --> 22:38.066
MDE?

22:38.150 --> 22:42.112
By reaching 75% refinement on Siena,
you have earned

22:42.196 --> 22:47.910
for you and your fellow refiners
a five-minute Music Dance Experience.

22:48.785 --> 22:52.915
Mr. Milchick, she's at 73%.

22:54.041 --> 22:56.126
Yes, well, it's been a tough morning
on all of us.

22:56.835 --> 22:59.129
- Why for you?
- And I thought a little frivolity

22:59.213 --> 23:01.215
would be just what the doctor ordered.

23:01.798 --> 23:04.718
Helly, please approach the MDE cart.

23:06.803 --> 23:09.890
You may choose one genre
and one accessory.

23:15.145 --> 23:18.357
The maraca. Excellent choice.

23:18.440 --> 23:20.776
Should've gone for the castanets.

23:22.069 --> 23:25.405
I choose "Defiant Jazz."

23:26.698 --> 23:29.034
Though this experience
is in Helly's honor,

23:29.117 --> 23:32.871
I urge all the refiners to take advantage
of the opportunity presented.

23:46.260 --> 23:47.261
Wow.

23:48.804 --> 23:49.805
Okay.

23:56.061 --> 23:57.062
Cheers.

23:57.771 --> 23:58.897
I'm nervous!

24:20.127 --> 24:21.378
Come on, Mark.

24:42.274 --> 24:44.193
Irving, what you got? Let's see it.

25:29.905 --> 25:32.699
<i>Daddy. Daddy. Daddy.</i>

25:38.956 --> 25:42.209
- What is his name? Tell me his name!
- Dylan! Get him off me!

25:42.292 --> 25:43.293
Get him off me!

25:46.255 --> 25:48.757
- He's biting me!
- Dylan, what the hell!

25:48.841 --> 25:52.219
- Jesus Christ! Dylan! Come on, Dylan!
- He's biting me!

26:03.313 --> 26:04.523
He broke the skin.

26:05.107 --> 26:07.234
He needs a full tetanus toxoid panel.

26:10.112 --> 26:13.407
You've done it now, Dylan.
I'm reporting this to Ms. Cobel.

26:14.199 --> 26:15.868
Yeah, you wanna go see her together?

26:30.132 --> 26:33.260
The Music Dance Experience
is officially canceled.

26:46.231 --> 26:47.691
What is wrong with you?

26:48.483 --> 26:49.735
They can wake us up.

26:50.694 --> 26:51.778
What?

26:52.946 --> 26:55.949
On the outside.
It's called the overtime contingency.

26:56.783 --> 26:58.118
What are you talking about?

26:58.869 --> 27:00.954
Last night, after I went up the elevator,

27:01.038 --> 27:04.583
I woke up outside, in my house,
with Milchick.

27:05.709 --> 27:06.710
What?

27:09.338 --> 27:10.547
I saw my son.

27:16.637 --> 27:17.846
<i>And then he hugged me.</i>

27:19.348 --> 27:21.183
He was so happy to see me.

27:23.560 --> 27:26.230
Then Milchick pulled him off,
and it was over.

27:28.315 --> 27:31.109
It happened so fast,
I just keep trying to remember more.

27:31.193 --> 27:34.321
- Jesus, Dylan. That's crazy.
- Yeah, it's not fair.

27:35.280 --> 27:38.075
And now I'm just supposed to
have that in my head every day here.

27:38.158 --> 27:39.660
And I never get to see him again.

27:39.743 --> 27:41.995
He's not your son, Dylan.
He's your outie's son.

27:42.079 --> 27:44.957
That's bullshit. He's my son too.

27:46.083 --> 27:48.877
This is good. We could use this.

27:48.961 --> 27:50.212
What?

27:50.295 --> 27:51.839
If they can wake us up on the outside,

27:51.922 --> 27:54.132
what's to stop us
from doing it to ourselves?

27:54.216 --> 27:55.884
What's to stop us?

27:56.802 --> 28:00.597
We can find whatever they use to
control it and, you know, commandeer it.

28:02.057 --> 28:04.393
We can all see the outside,
find out who we are.

28:04.476 --> 28:07.896
But, Helly, forgive me,
but that's perverse. We're innies.

28:07.980 --> 28:11.900
Plus, the controls are surely
somewhere we can't access.

28:13.110 --> 28:14.862
Like the security office?

28:16.864 --> 28:18.115
Is that…

28:18.198 --> 28:19.408
Graner's key card?

28:20.075 --> 28:22.119
- Where did you find it?
- In my pocket

28:22.202 --> 28:23.787
during the Music Dance Experience.

28:23.871 --> 28:27.624
I think I must've had it with me
when I came in today.

28:27.708 --> 28:30.294
Why does your outie have the key card
of our head of security?

28:34.631 --> 28:35.757
I don't know.

28:40.137 --> 28:42.055
I think it's time for a field trip.

28:42.639 --> 28:45.142
To the security office
where all the security guards work?

28:45.225 --> 28:46.226
Amazing. Yeah.

28:46.310 --> 28:49.188
Who's to say there are security guards?
I've only ever seen Graner.

28:49.271 --> 28:52.024
- What about Milchick?
- He can't be everywhere at once.

28:52.107 --> 28:54.860
- This whole line of con--
- Do you know where the office is?

28:55.861 --> 28:58.530
Petey saw it during a fire alarm
last year. He showed me.

29:02.201 --> 29:03.577
We can do this.

29:15.672 --> 29:18.091
Look, if Milchick does show up, stall him.

29:18.175 --> 29:19.343
- I got it.
- Okay.

29:32.481 --> 29:34.024
Hopefully this works.

29:46.787 --> 29:48.247
No cavalry yet.

29:48.914 --> 29:51.500
Okay, it's a ways past perpetuity, so--

29:51.583 --> 29:52.584
Irving.

29:52.668 --> 29:53.752
I'm sorry, Mark.

29:53.836 --> 29:56.380
- Where you going?
- I have to make sure Burt's okay.

29:56.463 --> 29:57.589
What about the plan?

29:57.673 --> 30:00.551
I-- I'm sorry, Mark. I can't hear you!
I'll be back!

30:01.218 --> 30:02.636
- I mean--
- What?

30:05.556 --> 30:06.557
Okay.

30:33.584 --> 30:34.793
It's this one.

31:16.001 --> 31:17.753
This is fucking weird.

31:27.012 --> 31:28.305
It's over here.

31:38.232 --> 31:39.566
Oh, my God.

31:45.447 --> 31:47.032
Look, that's us.

31:48.909 --> 31:50.786
What's the name of that thing?
The oversight something?

31:50.869 --> 31:51.995
The overtime contingency.

31:58.210 --> 31:59.545
Shit.

32:08.345 --> 32:10.055
- Shit.
- What?

32:14.309 --> 32:15.602
It's Cobel.

32:15.686 --> 32:16.854
She won't come here.

32:18.355 --> 32:21.441
Okay. It's great you know that.
Let's get the fuck outta here.

32:35.205 --> 32:36.456
Harmony, I was looking for you.

32:36.540 --> 32:38.458
- Now isn't a good--
- I have the Board here.

32:39.501 --> 32:40.669
Right now?

32:41.295 --> 32:42.504
Doug Graner is dead.

32:46.425 --> 32:47.426
What?

32:48.427 --> 32:50.345
The Board finds this deeply troubling.

32:51.138 --> 32:53.557
The Board wants to know
if you knew he was missing

32:53.640 --> 32:55.058
and if you've spoken to the police.

32:58.187 --> 33:00.522
Whoever killed Mr. Graner is probably

33:00.606 --> 33:03.942
the same person
who reintegrated Peter Kilmer.

33:07.946 --> 33:09.615
The Board reminds you
that reintegration is not--

33:09.698 --> 33:13.368
Reintegration happened.
And I have the data to prove it.

33:13.952 --> 33:18.999
And I would be happy
to share my findings in person

33:19.082 --> 33:21.251
without intermediaries.

33:28.342 --> 33:29.510
The Board agrees…

33:33.180 --> 33:36.725
and will be available to meet with you
at the Eagan Family Gala next week

33:36.808 --> 33:40.062
to discuss this further. Details to come.

33:50.614 --> 33:52.824
I look forward to receiving them.

34:29.987 --> 34:33.489
So, no one is in there?
That's lax as fuck.

34:34.449 --> 34:37.452
Well, maybe it's enough that
we think we're constantly being watched.

34:37.536 --> 34:40.246
It's too bad nobody told you guys
that everything here is bullshit.

34:40.330 --> 34:42.081
- Is that making sense?
- Yeah.

34:42.666 --> 34:45.335
There's a bunch of steps,
but it's actually pretty straightforward.

34:45.418 --> 34:47.713
You just engage the trackball,
type the code,

34:47.795 --> 34:50.340
then it's switch, type, flip,

34:50.424 --> 34:52.176
- type, hold.
- What?

34:54.261 --> 34:57.639
Trackball, type, switch,
type, flip, type, hold. Boom.

34:58.682 --> 34:59.808
What?

34:59.892 --> 35:03.562
I'm smart. That's why I have three times
as many finger traps as you guys.

35:04.146 --> 35:07.149
But to do this,
one of us has to stay behind, right?

35:07.232 --> 35:10.360
Yeah, after work. I can do it.
I've already been out, so it's only fair.

35:10.444 --> 35:13.697
Very noble of you, but I think
it's designed as a two-man operation.

35:13.780 --> 35:15.449
Great. I have the strength of two men.

35:16.450 --> 35:18.035
It's not about strength.

35:18.619 --> 35:21.580
Yeah, see. There are two lever switches
that you have to hold open

35:21.663 --> 35:23.081
during the actual procedure.

35:24.082 --> 35:26.084
And they're on either side of the door.

35:28.462 --> 35:29.463
I can do it.

35:33.425 --> 35:35.093
Ladies and gentlemen,

35:35.177 --> 35:39.765
how about a round of applause
for the man of the hour?

35:42.226 --> 35:45.312
Come and circle up! Gather round.

35:45.395 --> 35:47.105
Burt, Burt, Burt.

35:56.490 --> 35:58.534
Greetings, Designers…

35:59.826 --> 36:01.411
and one Refiner.

36:03.914 --> 36:05.999
We'll have to get those doors looked at.

36:06.667 --> 36:08.001
In the meantime…

36:08.710 --> 36:12.714
Burt G. This is for you.

36:19.763 --> 36:20.764
<i>Hello.</i>

36:22.808 --> 36:24.810
<i>This is kinda strange, but…</i>

36:26.812 --> 36:29.273
<i>a lot of things about this job are.</i>

36:29.773 --> 36:32.067
<i>You all know that better than me,
I'm guessing.</i>

36:32.150 --> 36:36.154
<i>And, of course,
I don't really know any of you,</i>

36:36.947 --> 36:39.533
<i>but the man standing there
with you now does.</i>

36:40.325 --> 36:43.662
<i>He's worked with you
for nearly seven years,</i>

36:43.745 --> 36:46.081
<i>and I hope they've been good years.</i>

36:46.164 --> 36:48.417
<i>I-- I don't know what they've been like,</i>

36:48.500 --> 36:51.670
<i>or what exactly I, or he,
has been doing with you,</i>

36:51.753 --> 36:57.467
<i>but I do know how I feel
every day when I come from being with you.</i>

36:58.302 --> 37:03.974
<i>I come home feeling tired but fulfilled.
I feel satisfied.</i>

37:04.057 --> 37:05.976
<i>I must like you very much.</i>

37:06.059 --> 37:08.979
<i>And though today is my last day with you,</i>

37:09.062 --> 37:12.816
<i>I'm certain you will remain
with me in spirit</i>

37:12.900 --> 37:18.447
<i>in some deep, yet completely unaccessible,
corner of my mind.</i>

37:18.947 --> 37:21.867
<i>The impression you've left on me
is indelible,</i>

37:22.367 --> 37:25.412
<i>though I'm unaware of it
on a conscious level, and…</i>

37:25.954 --> 37:29.917
<i>I will never forget any of you,
even though sitting here right now,</i>

37:30.000 --> 37:33.587
<i>I have no recollection
of actually ever meeting you</i>

37:33.670 --> 37:36.215
<i>and no idea of your names</i>

37:36.298 --> 37:39.176
<i>or any of your physical characteristics</i>

37:39.259 --> 37:42.012
<i>or even how many of you there are.</i>

37:42.095 --> 37:44.765
<i>Anyway, I just wanna say, thank you, all.</i>

37:44.848 --> 37:46.975
<i>And Burt, I see you.</i>

37:47.684 --> 37:49.728
<i>Congratulations.</i>

37:50.729 --> 37:52.105
<i>Good job, buddy.</i>

37:53.774 --> 37:55.108
<i>Bon voyage.</i>

38:10.958 --> 38:13.710
You're all just gonna stand here…

38:15.087 --> 38:16.588
and let him die?

38:17.172 --> 38:18.423
Irving, what?

38:19.049 --> 38:24.513
Are we being punished
for defying the guidance of the founder?

38:25.097 --> 38:29.476
Burt's outie is retiring.
It'll happen to you too someday.

38:30.477 --> 38:32.938
You smug motherfucker.

38:34.481 --> 38:35.941
You're not severed.

38:37.067 --> 38:39.152
You walk out of here with your memories.

38:39.236 --> 38:41.738
You carry them home with you every night.

38:42.656 --> 38:45.868
No one can rip them away from you,
snuff them out.

38:46.535 --> 38:48.161
Like they never existed.

38:48.829 --> 38:50.539
Like you never existed!

38:50.622 --> 38:53.542
That's enough! You will go back to MDR.

38:53.625 --> 38:55.919
Mr. Milchick, please.

38:56.003 --> 38:58.547
It'd be so wonderful to have him here.

39:00.215 --> 39:01.633
He won't say anything more.

39:12.436 --> 39:15.856
You can stay for Burt's party
and support his transition.

39:16.523 --> 39:20.152
But only if you behave in a manner
that brings no shame upon yourself,

39:20.235 --> 39:21.987
the founder or his progeny.

39:25.407 --> 39:27.701
I don't know
what's gotten into you people today.

39:36.376 --> 39:39.630
Yes, Mr. Milchick.

39:41.131 --> 39:45.427
Now, let's all say goodbye to Burt.

39:54.937 --> 39:58.273
I hope you all will enjoy Burt G.'s
innie retirement song selection.

40:16.250 --> 40:21.713
<i>Good morning, yesterday</i>

40:22.422 --> 40:28.178
<i>You wake up
And time has slipped away</i>

40:28.846 --> 40:32.307
<i>And suddenly it's hard to find</i>

40:32.391 --> 40:35.143
<i>The memories you left behind</i>

40:35.227 --> 40:40.858
<i>Remember, do you remember?</i>

40:41.441 --> 40:46.738
<i>The laughter and the tears</i>

40:47.489 --> 40:53.120
<i>The shadows of misty yesteryears</i>

40:53.704 --> 40:56.957
<i>The good times and the bad you've seen</i>

40:57.040 --> 41:00.127
<i>And all the others in between</i>

41:00.210 --> 41:04.631
<i>Remember, do you remember</i>

41:04.715 --> 41:08.385
<i>The times of your life?</i>

41:08.468 --> 41:12.514
<i>Do you remember?</i>

41:12.598 --> 41:18.395
<i>Reach back for the joy and the sorrow</i>

41:19.188 --> 41:24.443
<i>Put them away in your mind</i>

41:25.152 --> 41:30.699
<i>For memories are time that you borrow</i>

41:31.408 --> 41:37.331
<i>To spend when you get to tomorrow</i>

41:39.124 --> 41:45.005
<i>Here comes the saddest part</i>

41:45.088 --> 41:47.007
<i>Comes the saddest part</i>

41:47.090 --> 41:52.095
<i>The seasons are passing one by one</i>

41:53.096 --> 41:56.391
<i>So gather moments while you may</i>

41:56.475 --> 41:59.394
<i>Collect the dreams you dream today</i>

41:59.478 --> 42:01.438
<i>Remember</i>

42:02.272 --> 42:07.236
<i>Will you remember
The times of your life?</i>

42:15.619 --> 42:16.620
Irving?

42:29.424 --> 42:32.177
Let's burn this place to the ground.

43:42.080 --> 43:43.498
- Hey.
- Hey.

43:46.168 --> 43:47.169
My phone.

43:48.337 --> 43:49.922
Right, yeah. Come on in.

43:56.136 --> 43:57.137
How are you?

43:57.763 --> 43:59.681
- I'm good. How are you?
- That's great.

43:59.765 --> 44:02.476
Come on in.
You know, make yourself at home.

44:04.561 --> 44:07.356
You know, I found it
between the wall and the bed.

44:09.399 --> 44:13.111
You know, I would've dropped it off,
but I don't know where you live.

44:13.195 --> 44:15.489
So, this is great.

44:19.284 --> 44:20.410
Are you okay?

44:21.537 --> 44:24.831
Yeah. I'm fine. You know, a little tired.

44:26.625 --> 44:27.626
Okay. I'm gonna go.

44:27.709 --> 44:28.919
No, no. Come on.

44:29.002 --> 44:31.004
Hey, look.
I just don't think you're ready for this.

44:31.088 --> 44:33.173
- No, I think I'm really ready for this.
- No.

44:33.257 --> 44:35.884
I don't think you're ready for anything.
I think you're a mess right now.

44:35.968 --> 44:38.053
- Well, I'm really sorry.
- Okay.

44:38.136 --> 44:41.849
And I'm sorry for talking about her.

44:42.933 --> 44:44.560
No, it was too much. It was--

44:45.477 --> 44:47.938
You know what? You can talk about her.
You can not talk about her.

44:48.021 --> 44:50.232
- Whatever you want.
- Okay. H-Hold on.

44:50.315 --> 44:51.316
Watch this.

45:00.826 --> 45:02.953
See? That's her.

45:14.548 --> 45:15.549
Gone.

45:28.478 --> 45:29.479
What?

45:31.190 --> 45:33.108
Okay. Wow.

45:35.152 --> 45:39.031
Alexa, you know, we could--
We'll talk all about Gemma.

45:40.199 --> 45:43.660
She was great. She wa--

45:43.744 --> 45:45.245
Goodbye, Mark.

45:47.331 --> 45:48.457
Really?

45:50.709 --> 45:51.710
Oh, my--

46:12.898 --> 46:14.316
She was great.

46:23.867 --> 46:25.369
She was extraordinary.

46:36.713 --> 46:42.386
<i>I'll be seeing you</i>

46:43.428 --> 46:50.060
<i>In all the old familiar places</i>

46:51.520 --> 46:58.360
<i>That this heart of mine embraces</i>

46:59.027 --> 47:02.781
<i>All day through</i>

47:06.076 --> 47:12.583
<i>In that small café</i>

47:13.876 --> 47:19.882
<i>The park across the way</i>

47:21.633 --> 47:27.264
<i>The children's carousel</i>

47:28.557 --> 47:31.226
<i>The chestnut tree</i>

47:31.310 --> 47:34.688
<i>My wife was extraordinary.</i>

47:37.191 --> 47:42.529
<i>I'll be seeing you</i>

47:42.613 --> 47:45.824
<i>My wife was allergic to nutmeg.</i>

47:45.908 --> 47:49.828
<i>In every lovely summer's day</i>

47:49.912 --> 47:53.123
<i>And when she sneezed,
she always sneezed twice.</i>

47:53.207 --> 47:58.337
<i>In everything that's light and gay</i>

47:58.420 --> 48:00.672
<i>My wife liked other people's dogs.</i>

48:00.756 --> 48:04.301
<i>I'll always think of you that way</i>

48:04.384 --> 48:07.679
<i>My wife thought
cardigans looked ridiculous.</i>

48:07.763 --> 48:10.432
<i>I'll find you…</i>

48:10.516 --> 48:12.518
<i>I loved all these things about her…</i>

48:16.063 --> 48:17.064
<i>equally.</i>

48:17.147 --> 48:21.944
<i>And when the night is new</i>

48:23.403 --> 48:27.783
<i>I'll be looking at the moon</i>

48:28.534 --> 48:33.372
<i>But I'll be seeing you</i>

48:40.546 --> 48:47.386
<i>I'll be seeing you</i>

48:49.012 --> 48:55.018
<i>In every lovely summer's day</i>

48:57.104 --> 49:03.360
<i>In everything that's light and gay</i>

49:05.112 --> 49:11.243
<i>I'll always think of you that way</i>

49:12.327 --> 49:15.581
<i>I'll find you</i>

49:16.290 --> 49:20.127
<i>In the morning sun</i>

49:21.420 --> 49:27.342
<i>And when the night is new</i>

49:28.427 --> 49:33.390
<i>I'll be looking at the moon</i>

49:34.725 --> 49:41.565
<i>But I'll be seeing you</i>
