WEBVTT

00:13.280 --> 00:14.440
Hello. Look at that.

00:15.840 --> 00:18.760
Ooh, she's got a powerful left hand,
that Mrs Willis.

00:20.000 --> 00:23.839
You have to marvel at the chemistry
that could bring those two together.

00:23.840 --> 00:26.160
Yeah, apparently they met
at Butlins.

00:26.200 --> 00:29.720
He said that she looked like
Marilyn Monroe.

00:29.760 --> 00:31.159
Give over!

00:31.160 --> 00:33.160
Marilyn Monroe were gorgeous.

00:33.200 --> 00:36.439
Mrs Willis looks more like
Marilyn Manson.

00:36.440 --> 00:39.440
Yeah, but you're forgetting
the power of Butlins.

00:39.480 --> 00:42.279
Those chalets were like incubators.

00:42.280 --> 00:46.080
Do you know it was the first time in
British social history that

00:46.120 --> 00:48.400
lovers were free from damp grass?

00:50.880 --> 00:53.040
Maybe she did look like
Marilyn Monroe.

00:53.080 --> 00:54.080
In the dark.

00:58.360 --> 00:59.600
I do love a happy ending. Mmm.

01:03.240 --> 01:04.239
Hi, Leroy.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
Hi, Wendy.

01:09.160 --> 01:11.800
That's a lot of Wendy to be
saying hi to, isn't it?

01:12.840 --> 01:16.200
That is number 37, Hazelwood drive.

01:16.240 --> 01:17.440
Divorced.

01:17.480 --> 01:18.880
Just moved in.

01:18.920 --> 01:22.599
Well, remember,
she may look like that now...

01:22.600 --> 01:27.240
but inside there's an old Mrs Willis
waiting to come out.

01:47.120 --> 01:48.520
HE BREATHES DEEPLY

01:53.040 --> 01:56.319
There was somebody wearing perfume
in this doorway last night.

01:56.320 --> 01:58.240
Could be him from Sprotbrough.

01:59.520 --> 02:02.120
Actually, it was her with me.

02:02.160 --> 02:04.360
Elaine.

02:04.400 --> 02:06.616
Ooh, she always smells good enough
to make you forget people

02:06.640 --> 02:07.840
not called Elaine.

02:09.080 --> 02:12.800
Oh, well, let's see what sort of
mood Arkwright's in this morning.

02:12.840 --> 02:13.920
Oh!

02:17.640 --> 02:20.639
Who's had a bad night, then?

02:20.640 --> 02:22.599
Short, as usual.

02:22.600 --> 02:25.080
Just remember, if you were
longer in bed

02:25.120 --> 02:26.480
your pyjamas wouldn't fit.

02:28.560 --> 02:32.720
I could be reclining on a hammock,
in some warm country,

02:32.760 --> 02:34.240
with Scarlett Johansson.

02:34.280 --> 02:36.440
What, on one hammock?

02:36.480 --> 02:38.720
Well, we're saving up for
a mortgage.

02:38.760 --> 02:40.999
She doesn't want to live
over the shop.

02:41.000 --> 02:43.960
Although I've told her we'll move
the boxes of baked beans.

02:44.000 --> 02:47.240
You don't dream like a grocer, you.

02:47.280 --> 02:49.760
Some of my best ideas come at night.

02:49.800 --> 02:50.920
And mine.

02:52.760 --> 02:57.199
While you're snoring I'm
practising advanced grocery.

02:57.200 --> 03:00.240
You know, plotting and scheming
for this business?

03:00.280 --> 03:01.879
You know what the trouble is?

03:01.880 --> 03:04.520
We've no room for expansion.

03:04.560 --> 03:06.759
I'm not surprised, on one hammock.

03:06.760 --> 03:09.759
Have you never thought about moving
to bigger premises?

03:09.760 --> 03:11.640
TILL BANGS
COINS SCATTER

03:15.720 --> 03:17.119
Now look what you've done.

03:17.120 --> 03:18.720
You know he's had a bad night!

03:21.440 --> 03:23.760
He didn't mean it.

03:23.800 --> 03:26.240
It was just, you know,
off the top of his head.

03:27.400 --> 03:29.120
Bit of mental dandruff.

03:31.280 --> 03:33.720
You know what they're like,
at his age.

03:33.760 --> 03:34.760
Hmm?

03:35.800 --> 03:37.200
Lucky be-be-beggar.

03:40.920 --> 03:43.080
What have you been buying now?

03:43.120 --> 03:44.439
Well, what have you got?

03:44.440 --> 03:45.759
"Little Jump-start.

03:45.760 --> 03:48.999
"Electronic assistance for
tired feelings.

03:49.000 --> 03:51.560
"Turn your thoughts into
muscular activity."

03:51.600 --> 03:53.680
Oh, "Batteries not included."

03:53.720 --> 03:56.920
Hey, hey - we sell batteries,
don't we, eh?

03:56.960 --> 03:58.240
"Bored with life?

03:58.280 --> 04:00.560
"You need a Little Jump-start.

04:00.600 --> 04:02.800
"Scientific way to boost
lost feelings."

04:02.840 --> 04:04.640
Who is going to fall for that?

04:04.680 --> 04:06.079
Apart from you.

04:06.080 --> 04:07.479
Well, it doesn't matter, does it?

04:07.480 --> 04:10.799
I mean, if they don't work
we can say they're...

04:10.800 --> 04:12.720
mognamite detectors.

04:14.800 --> 04:16.200
Mognamite?

04:16.240 --> 04:19.959
It's a little-known gas that seeps
out of old wardrobes

04:19.959 --> 04:22.320
and discarded knee bandages.

04:24.160 --> 04:25.759
Right, what's it say?

04:25.760 --> 04:27.880
"Just carry in pocket.

04:27.920 --> 04:29.920
"Do not exceed the recommended."

04:29.960 --> 04:31.640
The recommended what?

04:31.680 --> 04:33.679
It doesn't say. Just ends there.

04:33.680 --> 04:35.480
Oh. All right. Well, never mind.

04:35.520 --> 04:38.120
Go on - put a battery in and
then you can try it.

04:41.440 --> 04:42.479
Me?

04:42.480 --> 04:43.759
Well, you'll be all right,

04:43.760 --> 04:46.280
as long as you don't
exceed the recommended.

04:48.520 --> 04:50.840
Why don't we both try one?

04:50.880 --> 04:51.960
All right, OK.

05:07.600 --> 05:08.959
You've bought a turkey again.

05:13.360 --> 05:15.720
Oh, hiya.
You must be Granville.

05:15.760 --> 05:19.280
Yes. And you must be
Hazelwood Drive.

05:19.320 --> 05:21.200
That's right - number 37.

05:21.240 --> 05:23.200
Wendy. Oh.

05:23.240 --> 05:24.840
You run a good business here.

05:24.880 --> 05:27.799
And I like your taste in Leroys.

05:27.800 --> 05:30.320
Well, he's the only one I've got,

05:30.360 --> 05:33.360
so I'd like him back in
good condition.

05:33.400 --> 05:36.040
Yeah, well, I'll be home later,
awaiting his delivery.

05:36.080 --> 05:37.696
Tell him to add a bottle of vodka,
all right?

05:37.720 --> 05:39.680
Yes, he likes vodka.

05:39.720 --> 05:40.880
I know. Oh.

05:40.920 --> 05:41.920
Bye. Bye.

05:43.160 --> 05:44.360
BELL JINGLES

05:48.240 --> 05:49.840
Hey...

05:49.880 --> 05:52.959
I don't know how you can say
we don't need more space.

LEROY SNIFFS

05:55.960 --> 05:57.360
Wendy!

05:57.400 --> 05:58.760
Now, listen to me -

05:58.800 --> 06:01.199
you pack in that vodka.

06:01.200 --> 06:02.719
She's going to be a good customer.

06:02.720 --> 06:04.600
Nice woman.

06:04.640 --> 06:07.600
"Nice" is not the first thing
that springs to mind.

06:09.160 --> 06:11.199
I know what you mean.

06:11.200 --> 06:12.560
CRACKLE OF ELECTRICITY

06:14.480 --> 06:15.480
Hey!

06:18.000 --> 06:20.400
What was that? Hmm?
What was what?

06:20.440 --> 06:23.960
Come on, you were thinking certain
thoughts and your arm shot up.

06:24.000 --> 06:25.280
Well, so were you!

06:25.320 --> 06:26.600
You were thinking something

06:26.640 --> 06:28.719
and your knee nearly went through
the ceiling!

06:28.720 --> 06:32.319
It is a perfectly innocent
grocer-client relationship.

06:32.320 --> 06:33.999
Yeah - just like you and Mavis.

06:34.000 --> 06:35.680
Oh, rubbish!

Hey!

06:38.600 --> 06:40.559
There you go. You see?

06:40.560 --> 06:43.200
Saucy thoughts and...
HE WHISTLES

06:44.520 --> 06:46.280
They get electronically assisted.

06:46.320 --> 06:47.720
Hmm?

06:47.760 --> 06:49.120
"A little muscular Jump-start."

06:49.160 --> 06:50.800
Hey...

06:50.840 --> 06:52.000
It's these things.

06:53.040 --> 06:54.200
Oh...

06:54.240 --> 06:56.119
Eh up!

06:56.120 --> 06:57.920
This might be useful, this.

07:00.880 --> 07:04.000
It's very odd to find you've got
a leg with its own agenda.

07:05.240 --> 07:08.960
A lot of people think that's
always been your problem.

07:09.000 --> 07:11.359
And who have they heard it from? Eh?

07:11.360 --> 07:12.800
You. Yes, well,

07:12.840 --> 07:15.560
I'm just trying to keep you away
from elderly women.

07:15.600 --> 07:17.279
Wendy is 35.

07:17.280 --> 07:19.840
Yes, well, so was that old
Mrs Willis and...

07:19.880 --> 07:21.480
look what's happened to her.

07:23.720 --> 07:25.319
And I am not mixed up.

07:25.320 --> 07:27.359
She merely invited me in for coffee.

07:27.360 --> 07:30.600
A good-looking woman, yeah,
but what's underneath?

07:30.640 --> 07:32.440
Actually, she's not my type.

07:32.480 --> 07:34.640
Oh, pull the other one, will you?

07:34.680 --> 07:38.320
I tell you what - if I were your
age, she'd certainly be my type.

07:38.360 --> 07:39.720
CRACKLE OF ELECTRICITY

BELL JINGLES

07:48.880 --> 07:50.480
Ah, the happy couple.

07:50.520 --> 07:52.440
Ooh, don't let's jump the gun.

07:52.480 --> 07:55.519
Mr Newbold is entitled to only very
limited pleasure in these

07:55.520 --> 07:58.440
early stages of our relationship.

07:58.480 --> 08:00.519
Limited pleasure.

08:00.520 --> 08:01.760
I can testify to that.

08:03.040 --> 08:06.319
A lot to look forward to, though.
Eh, Mr Newbold?

08:06.320 --> 08:07.320
Yes, isn't there?

08:08.880 --> 08:10.639
I've told him he'll have to
pace himself.

08:10.640 --> 08:12.919
I will allow no liberties

08:12.920 --> 08:13.920
before legalities.

08:15.120 --> 08:17.320
Except... under special
circumstances.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.320
CRACKLE OF ELECTRICITY

08:32.760 --> 08:34.559
Am I disturbing you, Granville?

08:35.840 --> 08:37.880
No, no, it's just a, just a twitch.

08:39.240 --> 08:42.080
I always say just a twitch is
better than none.

08:46.800 --> 08:49.480
Aren't we neglecting Mr Newbold?

08:49.520 --> 08:51.440
Yes, please do...

08:51.480 --> 08:53.360
carry on.

08:53.400 --> 08:56.520
I've recently begun to see the
benefits of neglect.

08:57.560 --> 09:00.200
Being on my own, abandoned.

09:00.240 --> 09:03.400
Pay no attention.
He has these little outbursts.

09:03.440 --> 09:05.679
But I'm reducing his carbohydrates.

09:05.680 --> 09:08.040
She is.
I can feel them shrinking.

09:10.280 --> 09:14.360
Now, we're here, Granville,
because Mr Newbold has a problem.

09:14.400 --> 09:15.400
I'll say.

09:21.040 --> 09:24.360
Mr Newbold has excessive
gravity in his underwear.

09:26.600 --> 09:28.959
That sounds serious.

09:28.960 --> 09:31.960
Well, look at him -
struggling with it now.

09:32.000 --> 09:35.080
Mr Newbold's boxer shorts are
forever on their way down.

09:36.480 --> 09:42.239
Forgivable, surely, in the first
flush of excitement of meeting you.

09:42.240 --> 09:44.479
They're falling down on their
own initiative.

09:44.480 --> 09:47.159
They're not party to any excitement.

09:47.160 --> 09:50.999
And I don't see why the state of my
underwear should go public.

09:51.000 --> 09:53.280
Nonsense! We have to find a cure.

09:53.320 --> 09:56.919
Can't have you squirming
down the street.

09:56.920 --> 09:58.160
Look as if you're pole dancing.

09:59.640 --> 10:01.120
Have you thought of buying new?

10:01.160 --> 10:04.160
No, he has this absurd sentimental
attachment to them.

10:04.200 --> 10:06.000
It's only the elastic gone a bit.

10:06.040 --> 10:08.239
Otherwise they're perfectly sound.

10:08.240 --> 10:10.640
Right, now, listen -
if you call back later,

10:10.680 --> 10:15.840
I may have the solution,
fresh from my supplier.

10:15.880 --> 10:18.399
Fear not, we will stabilise
his underwear.

10:18.400 --> 10:19.400
Well, I hope so,

10:19.440 --> 10:22.040
cos I don't want people thinking
I'm behind his loose underwear.

10:23.480 --> 10:25.959
I don't want anyone behind me.

10:25.960 --> 10:28.120
I don't want anyone within
miles of me.

10:28.160 --> 10:30.160
Oh, stop panicking.

10:30.200 --> 10:31.760
I'm here for you, aren't I?

10:37.680 --> 10:39.919
Biscuit?
Oh, thank you.

10:39.920 --> 10:43.560
What is it about your husband
and your relatives?

10:43.600 --> 10:46.000
Why is there always this
iron curtain?

10:46.040 --> 10:48.040
Well, I'm not qualified to speak,

10:48.080 --> 10:51.799
but isn't picking a husband
a bit like impulse buying?

10:51.800 --> 10:54.320
Can you really be surprised if
your family thinks,

10:54.360 --> 10:57.080
"What the heck did she
buy that for?"

10:57.120 --> 11:00.199
I can understand my lot being
dubious about Eric.

11:00.200 --> 11:02.640
I mean, let's face it -
I'm dubious about Eric.

11:02.680 --> 11:04.880
No, you're not. You love him.

11:04.920 --> 11:06.080
Keep your voice down.

11:06.120 --> 11:07.560
I try and hide it.

11:07.600 --> 11:09.719
You do pretty well, normally.

11:09.720 --> 11:10.720
Oh, thank you.

11:13.240 --> 11:14.520
I don't get it.

11:14.560 --> 11:16.480
What have we got for
assisting gentleman

11:16.520 --> 11:18.480
to get a grip on their underwear?

11:18.520 --> 11:23.000
We have the answer to
a widespread problem in this area.

11:24.960 --> 11:27.640
And there it is - look!

11:27.680 --> 11:30.519
Right there, look - that's him.

11:30.520 --> 11:31.800
He's doing the dance.

11:34.200 --> 11:35.600
The underwear two-step.

11:39.280 --> 11:40.280
Chasing the bunny.

11:42.600 --> 11:43.880
The bunny?

11:43.920 --> 11:47.119
Aye, well, he's losing
his undies, eh?

11:47.120 --> 11:48.560
They're slipping down,

11:48.600 --> 11:49.600
aren't they?

11:52.880 --> 11:55.240
Making me feel like I'm losing mine.

11:55.280 --> 11:56.280
You probably are.

11:57.520 --> 11:59.520
I know I'm losing mine.

11:59.560 --> 12:02.279
Oh, no - don't tell me
it's the money belt!

12:02.280 --> 12:04.679
Oh, 'eck!

12:04.680 --> 12:06.840
Oh... Ooh...

12:09.960 --> 12:11.879
Is it your brother that's
the problem?

12:11.880 --> 12:13.159
You know, the...

12:13.160 --> 12:14.560
quiet one?

12:14.600 --> 12:16.280
That's tactful.

12:16.320 --> 12:19.120
You were going to say "miserable",
weren't you? No...

12:19.160 --> 12:20.360
It's true, I was.

12:20.400 --> 12:22.719
I know he's not Mr Smiley,

12:22.720 --> 12:25.640
but he's had a lot in his life
to be miserable about.

12:25.680 --> 12:29.199
All I ask of Eric is just
try and be nice to him.

12:29.200 --> 12:31.000
Oh, they're not good at nice.

12:31.040 --> 12:33.559
They do nasty much better.

12:33.560 --> 12:36.080
I find they're often
nicer underneath.

12:36.120 --> 12:38.160
Underneath an anaesthetic, maybe.

12:40.000 --> 12:41.199
That's true.

12:41.200 --> 12:42.680
They're all more bearable
unconscious.

12:44.240 --> 12:46.679
So, does he look after you brother?

12:46.680 --> 12:48.359
Does he 'eck!

12:48.360 --> 12:51.520
He says he does, but you should see
the look on his face.

12:51.560 --> 12:53.799
You'd think Lester had a disease!

12:53.800 --> 12:54.880
I've been to Leicester.

12:54.920 --> 12:56.000
It looked all right.

12:57.760 --> 12:59.479
Not the city!

12:59.480 --> 13:02.520
Cath's brother's called "Lester".

13:02.560 --> 13:05.160
Oh, I suppose it's better than
Wolverhampton.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.720
It's uncanny, really, isn't it?

13:09.760 --> 13:13.640
How I knew that braces would be
making a comeback?

13:13.680 --> 13:15.520
Well, I haven't seen any sign of it.

13:15.560 --> 13:17.680
Nobody I know wears braces.

13:17.720 --> 13:18.840
Well, of course not.

13:18.880 --> 13:20.959
You only know girls.

13:20.960 --> 13:24.720
No, the men have a proud tradition
of wearing their undies

13:24.760 --> 13:26.839
to destruction.

13:26.840 --> 13:29.920
Always find room for their
favourites.

13:29.960 --> 13:31.360
Better the devil you know...

13:31.400 --> 13:35.600
The ladies spend their lives trying
to snatch them off us.

13:35.640 --> 13:36.679
You wish!

13:36.680 --> 13:38.879
I mean, they're forever buying
new, aren't they?

13:38.880 --> 13:42.879
You know, new at Christmas and at
birthdays, and where do they end up?

13:42.880 --> 13:46.239
They end up in their packs
in the bottom of a drawer.

13:46.240 --> 13:47.760
So, here we are -

13:47.800 --> 13:49.640
forever chasing the bunny.

13:51.080 --> 13:54.279
The league of butterfingered
gentleman,

13:54.280 --> 13:57.120
whose undies are forever
diving to their knees.

13:59.000 --> 14:01.200
But Arkwright's have the solution!

14:03.880 --> 14:05.680
I'd a phone call from our Ethel.

14:07.520 --> 14:10.280
She says, "Walter's passed away."

14:10.320 --> 14:12.520
I tell her, "Oh...

14:12.560 --> 14:13.880
"I'm sorry to hear that.

14:15.080 --> 14:17.799
"But who's Walter?"

14:17.800 --> 14:19.919
She says, "You know who Walter is."

14:19.920 --> 14:21.199
And I say, "No.

14:21.200 --> 14:23.760
"There's not much point in
starting now, is there?"

14:23.800 --> 14:27.720
HE LAUGHS

14:33.360 --> 14:34.360
What?

14:36.600 --> 14:38.759
Just waiting for the sign.

14:38.760 --> 14:40.039
What kind of sign?

14:40.040 --> 14:42.719
Well, we'll know it when we see it.

14:42.720 --> 14:44.680
You think we'll see it?

14:44.720 --> 14:46.120
Oh, yes.

14:46.160 --> 14:47.320
Yes.

14:47.360 --> 14:51.239
He's the sort whose undies
are in for the long haul.

14:51.240 --> 14:52.760
What's he talking about?

14:57.680 --> 14:58.880
There he goes.

14:58.920 --> 15:00.720
That's it.

15:00.760 --> 15:02.120
Chasing the bunny.

15:13.440 --> 15:14.440
CRACKLE OF ELECTRICITY

15:20.280 --> 15:23.240
You don't know who you're
messing with, kid.

15:23.280 --> 15:24.639
You sure you've got the right kid?

15:24.640 --> 15:27.960
I don't want you parking your
trolley at number 37.

15:28.000 --> 15:29.800
I catch it there one more time

15:29.840 --> 15:31.400
and you're dead.

15:31.440 --> 15:32.479
Dead?

15:32.480 --> 15:34.319
Don't you think that's a bit OTT?

15:34.320 --> 15:36.079
Well, what am I supposed to
threaten you with -

15:36.080 --> 15:38.039
community service?

15:38.040 --> 15:40.920
Can we just clear up why you
need to threaten me at all?

15:40.960 --> 15:43.600
That's my wife you've been
parking your trolley at!

15:44.640 --> 15:46.840
She's divorced.
Don't get technical.

15:46.880 --> 15:48.040
How do you think it looks?

15:48.080 --> 15:51.759
She leaves me - Wayne Ferris...

15:51.760 --> 15:54.240
Now you see where you went wrong?

15:54.280 --> 15:55.760
You've heard the name, right?

15:55.800 --> 15:58.559
Wayne Ferris?

15:58.560 --> 15:59.440
No.

15:59.441 --> 16:01.239
Wayne Ferris!

16:01.240 --> 16:03.680
Rising figure in the
criminal underworld!

16:07.360 --> 16:08.400
Maybe you've, erm...

16:09.960 --> 16:11.880
Maybe you've heard my, erm,
street name.

16:13.680 --> 16:14.680
(The Undertaker.)

16:17.120 --> 16:18.200
Sorry. Oh!

16:18.240 --> 16:20.960
I'm on Facebook. Give me your
e-mail, I'll send you some
literature.

16:21.000 --> 16:22.080
If this is about Wendy...

16:22.120 --> 16:24.559
Bingo! Finally, yes!

16:24.560 --> 16:25.999
This is about Wendy -

16:26.000 --> 16:29.920
the Wendy YOU are on notice
to stay away from.

16:29.960 --> 16:31.999
I deliver her groceries.

16:32.000 --> 16:35.279
My people will deliver
her groceries.

16:35.280 --> 16:36.600
As of now,

16:36.640 --> 16:38.640
she's with Tesco's.

16:38.680 --> 16:40.199
"My people"!

16:40.200 --> 16:42.480
If you've got people,
where are your minders?

16:42.520 --> 16:44.759
I've got two of the best. Oh.

16:44.760 --> 16:47.199
You know, it's just that
they're... you know...

16:47.200 --> 16:48.800
It's their day off.

16:48.840 --> 16:50.079
On the same day?

16:50.080 --> 16:52.199
They're very fond of each other!

16:52.200 --> 16:54.280
Yeah? What am I
supposed to do, yeah?

16:54.320 --> 16:56.079
Ruin their leisure time together?

16:56.080 --> 16:57.920
Wayne, I think you're
telling porkies.

16:57.960 --> 16:59.360
I mean, you don't look dangerous.

16:59.400 --> 17:00.960
I think you're a sweetheart.

17:01.000 --> 17:02.879
I could kill you.

17:02.880 --> 17:04.559
I could kill you...

17:04.560 --> 17:05.839
with this finger.

17:05.880 --> 17:08.878
LEROY LAUGHS
You're killing me now, Wayne!

17:08.880 --> 17:10.119
You're hilarious! No...

17:10.160 --> 17:11.520
No, you couldn't be more wrong.

17:11.560 --> 17:13.359
You stay away

17:13.400 --> 17:15.878
from that gorgeous little creature.
All right?

17:15.880 --> 17:19.839
That is the first thing you've
said that makes any sense.

17:19.880 --> 17:21.919
She is gorgeous.

17:21.920 --> 17:23.878
CRACKLE OF ELECTRICITY
Oh... Oh, right!

17:23.880 --> 17:26.239
Oh, right! Right, that's how
you want it, is it?

17:26.240 --> 17:28.240
Sorry! You crossed a line, pal.

17:28.280 --> 17:30.040
You crossed a line!

17:30.080 --> 17:31.440
Wayne, she gives me coffee.

17:31.480 --> 17:33.559
I was talking to you civilly,

17:33.560 --> 17:35.719
and you start throwing
punches at me.

17:35.720 --> 17:38.120
Wayne, it was just a twitch.
You, you wait...

17:38.160 --> 17:41.679
you wait till my minders
get back from their...

17:41.680 --> 17:42.680
cookery classes.

17:46.720 --> 17:47.760
Aargh!

17:49.600 --> 17:51.319
Thank you. Right.

17:51.320 --> 17:53.359
There we are, Mrs Hussein -
your change.

17:53.360 --> 17:54.600
Thank you very much.

17:54.640 --> 17:57.040
I suppose you've heard about
Hazelwood Drive?

17:57.080 --> 17:59.040
Number 37? That's the one.

17:59.080 --> 18:01.080
No. What have you heard?

18:01.120 --> 18:05.319
As it happens - although, you know,
I am not one for gossip...

18:05.320 --> 18:07.439
Yeah, somebody was telling me that.

18:07.440 --> 18:09.439
I think it were you.

18:09.440 --> 18:10.479
Well...

18:10.480 --> 18:12.839
she's divorced but he wants
her back.

18:12.840 --> 18:14.280
She's spoiled rotten.

18:14.320 --> 18:17.679
It's his father's money - bought her
the house, furnished it through.

18:17.680 --> 18:19.280
She's changed the curtains twice!

18:19.320 --> 18:20.400
Oh!

18:20.440 --> 18:22.800
She takes pills for an
overactive thyroid.

18:24.080 --> 18:26.400
Where do you get all this stuff?

18:26.440 --> 18:28.200
She fancies your Leroy.

18:28.240 --> 18:30.239
She feeds him coffee.

18:30.240 --> 18:32.279
Leroy doesn't drink coffee.

18:32.280 --> 18:34.400
He's developing a taste for it.

18:34.440 --> 18:35.440
Two lumps.

18:37.280 --> 18:40.119
I suppose she's attractive to
certain men.

18:40.120 --> 18:42.959
Her cleaner says she wears next to
nothing round the house.

18:42.960 --> 18:45.400
Disgusting.
CRACKLE OF ELECTRICITY

18:49.200 --> 18:51.480
He's developing
a taste for coffee.

18:53.120 --> 18:55.560
He's using words like "latte".

18:58.400 --> 19:00.440
How can I compete? Eh?

19:01.640 --> 19:04.880
I mean, I can't start wearing next
to nothing round the house.

19:06.440 --> 19:08.519
BELL JINGLES

19:08.520 --> 19:09.720
I'll be back.

19:15.080 --> 19:19.280
What's this little Jump-start
you're offering for tired feelings?

19:22.160 --> 19:23.360
Come in, Cyril!

19:23.400 --> 19:25.400
Prepare to be amazed.

19:27.680 --> 19:30.839
Oh, and here's another
seeker of the truth.

19:30.840 --> 19:34.560
Even a lie,
if it improves your prospects.

19:34.600 --> 19:35.719
There she is.

19:35.720 --> 19:39.440
Your pathway
to a richer personal life.

19:39.480 --> 19:41.479
Batteries not included.

19:41.480 --> 19:43.680
So, how much richer
is your personal life

19:43.720 --> 19:45.279
when it's got a battery in it?

19:45.280 --> 19:49.400
Are we talking really personal
"personal life"?

19:51.440 --> 19:54.879
I mean, the kind your honeymoon
lures you into believing

19:54.880 --> 19:57.240
this could be a regular thing?

19:59.600 --> 20:01.720
With this little gadget,

20:01.760 --> 20:07.440
your scoring rate for the occasions
of domestic "bliss" will rocket.

20:07.480 --> 20:09.959
You'd go as far as "rocket"?

20:09.960 --> 20:11.480
I'd settle for the stairlift.

20:12.800 --> 20:16.159
This thing takes
all the guesswork out of it.

20:16.160 --> 20:20.640
This little beauty
will tell you when the time is right

20:20.680 --> 20:22.480
to make your move.

20:22.520 --> 20:23.719
It has better be right -

20:23.720 --> 20:24.960
or I might HAVE to move.

20:26.280 --> 20:28.399
How come this thing knows so much?

20:28.400 --> 20:30.000
A little piece of plastic

20:30.040 --> 20:32.000
without any hormones
or interest in...

20:33.480 --> 20:34.880
..basic messing around.

20:36.920 --> 20:39.159
A-ha, you see, that is where the
battery comes in, don't it?

20:39.160 --> 20:41.760
It brings it to life.

20:41.800 --> 20:44.640
It stirs up the atoms

20:44.680 --> 20:46.399
and they all go zipping about.

20:46.400 --> 20:48.880
And they come in contact
with the electrons.

20:48.920 --> 20:50.319
And the electrons then go,

20:50.320 --> 20:53.640
"Woop-woop-woop-woop,
woop-woop-woop-woop."

20:53.680 --> 20:54.919
HE JOINS IN

20:54.920 --> 20:56.200
HE ALSO JOINS IN

20:56.240 --> 20:57.840
DUO START BARKING

20:57.880 --> 20:59.599
No! Now, stop now!

20:59.600 --> 21:01.280
Please!

21:01.320 --> 21:04.240
Let's not get into nanotechnology.

21:06.160 --> 21:08.800
Do you want to
get into nanotechnology?

21:08.840 --> 21:11.640
Not necessarily,
at this moment in time.

21:13.280 --> 21:14.480
Right, now listen.

21:14.520 --> 21:17.759
You get her to carry one of
these about or, better still,

21:17.760 --> 21:20.560
you slip it in her pocket.

21:22.840 --> 21:25.240
How long do the batteries last?

21:26.880 --> 21:29.119
Don't worry.
I can always sell you a spare.

21:29.120 --> 21:31.040
Does it come with a guarantee?
No!

21:31.080 --> 21:34.000
It doesn't get BBC Two, either.

21:36.240 --> 21:40.440
Are you in an emotionally dry
place or not?

21:41.760 --> 21:43.120
Parched.

21:45.600 --> 21:47.879
Then, this is your future here.

21:47.880 --> 21:49.920
This is where the desert blooms.

21:59.680 --> 22:02.200
Stand there, Mr Newbold.
This is girl talk.

22:03.480 --> 22:05.680
I'm just taking him
to have his squirm removed.

22:07.000 --> 22:08.719
Sounds like a plan.

22:08.720 --> 22:11.439
Do you find they have a tendency

22:11.440 --> 22:13.360
to hang on to their old underwear?

22:13.400 --> 22:16.799
Oh. You could take their appendix
easier.

22:16.800 --> 22:19.480
The men round here
develop such a deep affection

22:19.520 --> 22:21.120
for their familiar underwear,

22:21.160 --> 22:23.919
I'm surprised no-one has written
an opera about it.

22:23.920 --> 22:26.160
Why is it, do you think?

22:27.240 --> 22:28.599
They don't like change.

22:28.600 --> 22:30.040
Which is fine...

22:30.080 --> 22:31.480
until your elastic goes.

22:40.240 --> 22:42.440
Right, hold on, sir, just a moment.

22:43.480 --> 22:46.000
There we go.
There, now, you see?

22:46.040 --> 22:49.920
You've got
free access to his undies.

22:49.960 --> 22:52.080
Would you care to rephrase that?

22:54.160 --> 22:55.240
A pair of braces?

22:55.280 --> 22:57.999
Yes, as recommended
by Sigmund Freud.

22:58.000 --> 23:01.520
It's the shortest way
to the well-adjusted male.

23:01.560 --> 23:03.760
I've sold eight pairs
of these today already.

23:03.800 --> 23:06.600
But I don't wear braces.

23:06.640 --> 23:08.720
You see, that is your problem.

23:08.760 --> 23:10.679
Wearing a belt,

23:10.680 --> 23:12.879
you can't get your hand

23:12.880 --> 23:16.360
down there, to haul
your boxers back up.

23:16.400 --> 23:17.800
Right?

23:17.840 --> 23:19.000
But now...

23:21.680 --> 23:24.759
..you can get both hands
down there, see?

23:24.760 --> 23:26.559
Haul them back up,

23:26.560 --> 23:28.320
like that.

23:30.000 --> 23:32.959
OK? Instant access

23:32.960 --> 23:34.840
to all the help you need.

23:34.880 --> 23:36.280
Well, don't look at me!

23:37.840 --> 23:39.880
Do you think we've been had?

23:39.920 --> 23:40.920
Again?

23:41.960 --> 23:43.120
Has he done it again?

23:44.640 --> 23:48.319
You know, he takes advantage
of the fact that we're desperate.

23:48.320 --> 23:51.359
I always wanted to be a good lover.

23:51.360 --> 23:52.640
Amusing,

23:52.680 --> 23:54.399
considerate,

23:54.400 --> 23:55.400
but above all...

23:57.000 --> 23:58.679
..regular.

23:58.680 --> 24:00.640
That's what you miss.

24:00.680 --> 24:03.080
It's the uncertainty
that gets to you.

24:10.240 --> 24:11.559
BOTH: Hey!

24:11.560 --> 24:13.040
BOTH: It works!

24:27.680 --> 24:28.680
DULL THUDDING

24:29.880 --> 24:30.800
Hmm?

24:30.801 --> 24:32.400
SOFT WHISTLING

24:43.520 --> 24:44.920
How was the coffee?

24:44.960 --> 24:46.920
It was just coffee.

24:46.960 --> 24:49.640
I met him - Wayne, the ex. Hmmp!

24:49.680 --> 24:51.600
He's a giggle.

24:51.640 --> 24:54.239
Oh, can I go a bit earlier
this evening?

24:54.240 --> 24:55.959
Where?

24:55.960 --> 24:58.720
Just out,
meet a few friends. Usual.

24:58.760 --> 25:02.399
You can get done
for some kinds of "usual".

25:02.400 --> 25:04.200
Not more coffee, I hope?

25:04.240 --> 25:06.279
No. Put your mind at rest.

25:06.280 --> 25:08.160
And stop being so suspicious.

25:08.200 --> 25:10.520
All right. You can go.

25:11.960 --> 25:13.360
I trust you.

25:15.200 --> 25:17.600
I don't trust him!

25:17.640 --> 25:20.040
He's going out and I want
to see where he's going!

25:20.080 --> 25:23.720
How are you going to follow him
if the shop's still open?

25:23.760 --> 25:25.320
Oh! Will you close it?

25:25.360 --> 25:26.360
No!

25:26.361 --> 25:28.880
No, no, I won't close the shop!

25:28.920 --> 25:32.040
I'm leaving Gastric in charge.

25:32.080 --> 25:34.680
Oh... please, God,

25:34.720 --> 25:37.920
don't let Gastric screw up.

25:37.960 --> 25:40.799
You see,
I'm borrowing Gastric's Mini,

25:40.800 --> 25:43.359
so I thought that
you could come with me.

25:43.360 --> 25:46.279
Oh, I don't know that
I'd be any good at following.

25:46.280 --> 25:48.919
Oh, it won't be
all following, will it?

25:48.920 --> 25:52.520
I mean, there will
be time for us. Hmm-hm.

25:52.560 --> 25:55.359
ELECTRICAL CRACKLING

25:55.360 --> 25:57.240
Hey!

25:59.160 --> 26:00.280
Come on.

26:02.640 --> 26:06.480
You said this was going
to be a little outing for us two.

26:06.520 --> 26:07.559
It is.

26:07.560 --> 26:10.240
I haven't forgotten that.

26:10.280 --> 26:13.240
You needn't think
I'd forgotten THAT.

26:14.520 --> 26:16.560
Oh.
ELECTRICAL CRACKLING

26:16.600 --> 26:18.240
ELECTRICAL CRACKLING

26:18.280 --> 26:19.280
Oh!

26:21.120 --> 26:23.240
Sorry. Sorry about that.

26:23.280 --> 26:26.439
It just...
It's my foot keeps jumping.

26:26.440 --> 26:29.759
It's nice to get
a few minutes together.

26:29.760 --> 26:33.000
Madge wanted to know
what we were going to do with it.

26:33.040 --> 26:34.079
Oh.

26:34.080 --> 26:35.200
ELECTRICAL CRACKLING
Oh! Oh!

26:35.240 --> 26:37.040
TYRES SCREECH

26:41.840 --> 26:42.879
Eugh!

26:42.880 --> 26:44.839
Don't smile at me. It sets me off.

26:44.840 --> 26:46.280
ELECTRICAL CRACKLING

26:47.440 --> 26:50.440
Can you move your knee somewhere...
ELECTRICAL CRACKLING

26:50.480 --> 26:53.319
..out of my eye-line?
Ooh! Open a window!

26:53.320 --> 26:54.800
ELECTRICAL CRACKLING

26:54.840 --> 26:56.120
That perfume is dangerous!

26:56.160 --> 26:58.360
Argh! Oh!

27:11.440 --> 27:12.760
ELECTRICAL CRACKLING

27:22.280 --> 27:25.559
'Wow, that Mavis is attractive,
even the wrong way up.'

27:25.560 --> 27:26.800
ELECTRICAL CRACKLING

27:26.840 --> 27:27.840
Oh!

27:36.440 --> 27:38.799
Next time, I'll drive.

27:38.800 --> 27:41.440
Well... I hope you're safer indoors.

27:42.480 --> 27:45.080
I suppose there's
only one way to find out.

27:45.120 --> 27:46.800
ELECTRICAL CRACKLING

27:48.320 --> 27:50.120
Oh, heck! Oh.

27:51.840 --> 27:53.440
Oh... heck!

27:58.160 --> 27:59.520
Hello, Mavis.

28:01.160 --> 28:02.840
Hello, Granville.
