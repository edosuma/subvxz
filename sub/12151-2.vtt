Ohn my idea.
The Host reads people's auras.

18:28.920 --> 18:32.833

Suren he can reverse the process
and trace the calls to The Powers.

18:38.960 --> 18:41.599

19:01.920 --> 19:07.233
I'm not morally against Ietting demons
into my subconscious for a Iookie-Ioo.

doing this whole Book of Job thing...

-Maybe he can make the noise stop.
-Yeah.

19:18.400 --> 19:21.756

-Yes. No. Well, no.

You're important.

-Did you just compare me to a car?
-It was a very nice car.

19:48.960 --> 19:54.910

I know I can be snippy sometimes.

23:03.520 --> 23:07.069
This isn't happening
because you're bad.

it's because you're strong.
