00:03.610 --> 00:06.560
<b><i>That's Morel's Smoky Jail...</i></b>

00:07.960 --> 00:11.520
<b><i>The ability he's using to separate 
Pouf from the King.</i></b>

00:12.980 --> 00:15.990
<b><i>If the third floor of the tower 
is surrounded by smoke,</i></b>

00:16.740 --> 00:18.880
<b><i>the King and Pitou aren't there.</i></b>

00:19.340 --> 00:20.220
<b><i>Where are they?</i></b>

02:13.980 --> 02:19.030
<b>Divide x And x Conquer</b>

02:24.980 --> 02:26.810
<b>Each has begun his own battle</b>

02:27.330 --> 02:30.300
<b>in his own respective location.</b>

03:28.070 --> 03:28.970
<b>Gon...</b>

03:49.840 --> 03:50.780
<b><i>Grandpa!</i></b>

03:52.630 --> 03:54.540
<b><i>Which means that that's...</i></b>

04:00.910 --> 04:01.810
<b><i>the King!</i></b>

04:04.180 --> 04:05.300
<b>Proceed.</b>

04:06.710 --> 04:11.170
<b>I am fully aware that you seek 
to accomplish your objective</b>

04:11.170 --> 04:15.310
<b>with minimal human casualties.</b>

04:16.660 --> 04:19.850
<b>You took advantage of the chaos in the palace</b>

04:19.850 --> 04:22.320
<b>in order to separate my Royal Guard from me.</b>

04:25.080 --> 04:26.180
<b>It makes no difference.</b>

04:28.420 --> 04:29.330
<b>Proceed.</b>

04:47.110 --> 04:48.940
<b><i>Dragon Head!</i></b>

04:50.520 --> 04:52.530
<b><i>He is frightening...</i></b>

04:53.020 --> 04:57.100
<b>The technique he unleashed was 
not intended to hurt the King.</b>

04:57.910 --> 05:01.530
<b>And both of them could tell that the King</b>

05:01.530 --> 05:03.250
<b>realized this at once.</b>

05:05.020 --> 05:09.480
<b>Zeno made certain that his <i>Nen</i> 
was completely neutral.</b>

05:09.960 --> 05:12.960
<b>Was it a gesture of respect? Or was it...</b>

05:50.780 --> 05:51.780
<b>Killua...</b>

05:53.340 --> 05:55.140
<b>Pitou is over there.</b>

05:59.370 --> 06:00.170
<b>Let's go!</b>

06:09.670 --> 06:10.700
<b><i>Let's go...</i></b>

06:15.890 --> 06:17.640
<b><i>In what sense did you mean that?</i></b>

06:21.710 --> 06:26.530
<b>Killua barely managed to stop himself 
from asking the question.</b>

06:28.740 --> 06:30.100
<b><i>If I ask that question,</i></b>

06:31.480 --> 06:33.160
<b><i>I won't be able to stop anymore...</i></b>

06:34.710 --> 06:36.010
<b><i>I won't be able to go back.</i></b>

06:40.640 --> 06:45.050
<b>If Killua would just ask, he would have his answer.</b>

06:46.450 --> 06:50.980
<b>Anyone with enough experience 
would easily arrive at that next step.</b>

06:51.720 --> 06:55.060
<b>But the fear of losing someone he cared for</b>

06:55.620 --> 07:00.290
<b>prevented him from taking that step.</b>

07:08.970 --> 07:11.270
<b>A few moments before the dragon took flight,</b>

07:12.000 --> 07:14.830
<b>Cheetu and Brovada appeared</b>

07:15.140 --> 07:17.540
<b>before Ikalgo.</b>

07:18.030 --> 07:19.590
<b>Hey, it's Flutter.</b>

07:38.060 --> 07:39.520
<b>What's with all the noise?</b>

07:39.900 --> 07:42.850
<b>Pitou-dono's <i>En</i> disappeared again.</b>

07:43.290 --> 07:46.040
<b>I just returned...</b>

07:46.040 --> 07:48.350
<b>It seems the enemy is attacking.</b>

07:48.800 --> 07:49.720
<b>Seriously?</b>

07:50.300 --> 07:53.510
<b>Well, I couldn't imagine anything else causing this.</b>

07:56.290 --> 07:58.040
<b>What happened to your wings?</b>

07:58.040 --> 07:59.600
<b>Oh, uh...</b>

07:59.600 --> 08:02.080
<b>I lost them earlier, during the attack.</b>

08:03.140 --> 08:04.090
<b>Are you going underground?</b>

08:04.610 --> 08:08.340
<b>Y-Yeah, I have orders from Hagya-sama.</b>

08:09.340 --> 08:10.790
<b>What should we do?</b>

08:12.540 --> 08:16.560
<b>Well, we weren't told to defend this place...</b>

08:16.880 --> 08:19.590
<b>But I'm just itching to try</b>

08:20.500 --> 08:21.770
<b>my new technique.</b>

08:25.570 --> 08:26.220
<b>It's huge...</b>

08:41.750 --> 08:43.120
<b>That looks fun!</b>

08:43.560 --> 08:44.900
<b>I'm gonna check it out!</b>

08:45.790 --> 08:46.630
<b>Be careful!</b>

08:47.510 --> 08:49.780
<b>I'm gonna see what's going on!</b>

08:50.230 --> 08:52.310
<b>Then, I'll be going.</b>

08:52.310 --> 08:53.130
<b>Okay.</b>

09:06.900 --> 09:09.150
<b><i>"Hagya-sama"?</i></b>

09:22.080 --> 09:25.910
<b>Meanwhile, in the throne room, 
in the central tower...</b>

09:37.680 --> 09:40.040
<b>Is it truly possible</b>

09:40.650 --> 09:43.680
<b>to trap me in one place?</b>

09:45.610 --> 09:47.810
<b>Why don't we find out?</b>

09:51.490 --> 09:52.820
<b><i>Wing scales...</i></b>

09:53.990 --> 09:57.820
<b><i>Knov said that they can hypnotize people.</i></b>

09:58.840 --> 10:01.500
<b><i>I don't want to inhale any...</i></b>

10:03.430 --> 10:05.450
<b>You seem to be finished talking.</b>

10:06.370 --> 10:08.980
<b>I would expect that of anyone 
with considerable power.</b>

10:09.560 --> 10:10.330
<b>However...</b>

10:20.180 --> 10:22.520
<b><i>Caution, resolve,</i></b>

10:23.550 --> 10:28.100
<b><i>and confidence in a 2:3:5 ratio.</i></b>

10:30.220 --> 10:34.250
<b><i>His caution isn't as strong 
because he's confident.</i></b>

10:34.750 --> 10:36.860
<b><i>It's safe to say he has a strong personality.</i></b>

10:38.240 --> 10:41.310
<b>Pouf's Spiritual Message</b>

10:41.310 --> 10:47.250
<b>surrounds his opponent with wing scales, 
making their aura more opaque,</b>

10:47.880 --> 10:51.260
<b>letting him sense their state of mind.</b>

10:54.750 --> 10:57.010
<b>I suppose I should introduce myself.</b>

10:59.660 --> 11:03.960
<b>I am Shaiapouf, one of the King's Royal Guard.</b>

11:10.540 --> 11:14.400
<b><i>His caution has increased slightly.</i></b>

11:17.630 --> 11:20.280
<b>You won't tell me your name?</b>

11:21.210 --> 11:23.430
<b>If you believe that I'm trying</b>

11:23.430 --> 11:31.910
<b>to trick you into inhaling my wing 
scales, you're sadly mistaken.</b>

11:31.910 --> 11:34.910
<b>And to be honest, I'm a little shocked.</b>

11:40.530 --> 11:42.940
<b>After a rebirth, all will be forgotten.</b>

12:00.150 --> 12:01.930
<b>I'll need you to wait a moment.</b>

12:12.810 --> 12:16.150
<b><i>If he wants to waste time, that's fine by me.</i></b>

12:17.710 --> 12:21.510
<b><i>No matter what sort of beast he emerges as...</i></b>

12:54.250 --> 12:57.860
<b>Shoot was fighting recklessly, 
without concern for his life,</b>

12:58.230 --> 13:01.460
<b>which turned out to be the 
reason he was still alive.</b>

13:04.340 --> 13:06.090
<b>Hotel Rafflesia...</b>

13:07.950 --> 13:12.150
<b>While barely dodging multiple attacks that 
would have been otherwise lethal,</b>

13:12.150 --> 13:17.390
<b>Shoot had only managed to take 
the eye on Youpi's shoulder.</b>

13:18.230 --> 13:21.280
<b>He had essentially done no damage.</b>

13:22.200 --> 13:23.240
<b>However...</b>

13:30.270 --> 13:32.750
<b>Youpi was unable to finish off his opponent.</b>

13:33.360 --> 13:38.830
<b>The strange sensation that his momentum 
was being stolen, rather than stopped,</b>

13:38.830 --> 13:42.250
<b>influenced Youpi's mental state tremendously.</b>

13:43.320 --> 13:47.000
<b>After taking multiple hits from 
attacks he didn't understand,</b>

13:47.000 --> 13:48.760
<b>Youpi was backing up.</b>

13:49.900 --> 13:53.770
<b><i>I can't let this guy near the King.</i></b>

13:56.370 --> 14:01.150
<b><i>Every second I keep him away 
from the King counts.</i></b>

14:03.000 --> 14:06.280
<b>Youpi and Shoot shared the same objective.</b>

14:07.050 --> 14:10.260
<b>However, this expected turn of events</b>

14:10.700 --> 14:14.040
<b>was difficult on Knuckle...</b>

14:17.360 --> 14:18.700
<b><i>Hold it in...</i></b>

14:18.700 --> 14:20.290
<b><i>I can't attack now!</i></b>

14:22.370 --> 14:26.230
<b><i>If I attack now, I'll be broadcasting</i></b>

14:26.230 --> 14:31.550
<b><i>that there's one more enemy 
he needs to worry about!</i></b>

14:35.900 --> 14:37.060
<b><i>Hold it in!</i></b>

14:40.320 --> 14:43.140
<b>Shoot was now covered in blood,</b>

14:43.140 --> 14:45.570
<b>as he endured Youpi's ferocious 
barrage of attacks.</b>

14:46.620 --> 14:50.230
<b>Forced to watch from the sidelines,</b>

14:50.820 --> 14:53.100
<b>just remaining hidden was a battle.</b>

14:53.720 --> 14:56.580
<b>No matter how he told himself to keep still...</b>

15:03.840 --> 15:06.800
<b><i>Hold it in... Please hold it in!</i></b>

15:08.500 --> 15:12.810
<b><i>Knuckle was unable to hold back the 
tears streaming down his face.</i></b>

15:14.840 --> 15:16.100
<b><i>You can do it!</i></b>

15:20.110 --> 15:21.300
<b>It's time.</b>

15:21.300 --> 15:22.810
<b>Adding interest.</b>

15:28.960 --> 15:31.110
<b><i>Only ten seconds have passed?</i></b>

15:31.510 --> 15:32.740
<b><i>You're kidding!</i></b>

15:34.910 --> 15:40.790
<b><i>How much longer do I have to endure 
this suffocating, excruciating wait</i></b>

15:40.790 --> 15:43.720
<b><i>that makes me want to do nothing but run away?</i></b>

15:45.600 --> 15:47.000
<b><i>This must be some kind of joke...</i></b>

15:47.400 --> 15:49.180
<b><i>And it isn't funny!</i></b>

15:57.750 --> 15:59.770
<b><i>I can't hold it in any longer!</i></b>

16:05.960 --> 16:08.320
<b>Knuckle's rampage was halted</b>

16:12.880 --> 16:15.660
<b>by the first tap from Meleoron.</b>

16:16.970 --> 16:20.080
<b><i>Seriously?! It's only been ten seconds!</i></b>

16:21.610 --> 16:24.420
<b><i>But that just might have saved me.</i></b>

16:26.380 --> 16:30.490
<b>Meleoron wasn't trying to help Knuckle.</b>

16:31.480 --> 16:33.870
<b>He, too, had reached his limit.</b>

16:39.360 --> 16:40.360
<b><i>Crap!</i></b>

16:43.170 --> 16:44.370
<b>Uh-oh.</b>

16:44.770 --> 16:48.880
<b><i>He barely scratched me, but it 
was enough damage</i></b>

16:48.880 --> 16:53.580
<b><i>to offset the interest and 
my full-strength attack.</i></b>

16:54.830 --> 16:58.130
<b><i>Shoot is risking his life out there,</i></b>

16:59.160 --> 17:02.840
<b><i>while I'm standing here unhurt, 
and making stupid mistakes!</i></b>

17:04.500 --> 17:07.560
<b>Youpi felt no sensation of scratching anything,</b>

17:07.560 --> 17:12.460
<b>nor did he notice APR's declaration 
of returned interest.</b>

17:12.800 --> 17:15.470
<b>Damn!</b>

17:16.320 --> 17:18.550
<b>He couldn't hear Knuckle's scream, either.</b>

17:19.980 --> 17:21.820
<b><i>Calm down, you fool...</i></b>

17:21.820 --> 17:23.980
<b><i>You're gonna ruin everything.</i></b>

17:27.000 --> 17:29.480
<b>Here's the distance where we want to stay...</b>

17:29.480 --> 17:33.720
<b>Not close enough for him to find us, 
but close enough to get in fast.</b>

17:34.210 --> 17:37.990
<b>He'll notice APR for a second, 
but that's no problem.</b>

17:40.150 --> 17:41.990
<b>Shoot's fighting hard,</b>

17:43.210 --> 17:46.250
<b>so go ahead and catch your breath, Meleoron.</b>

17:49.460 --> 17:51.160
<b><i>God's Accomplice...</i></b>

17:51.160 --> 17:52.170
<b>Undo.</b>

18:00.170 --> 18:01.790
<b><i>What is this thing?</i></b>

18:02.170 --> 18:03.390
<b><i>When did it show up?</i></b>

18:03.390 --> 18:06.220
<b><i>No, it can't be that I didn't notice it.</i></b>

18:06.570 --> 18:08.900
<b><i>It just suddenly appeared.</i></b>

18:09.650 --> 18:11.300
<b><i>Was I hit by an attack?</i></b>

18:11.840 --> 18:13.880
<b><i>No, I wasn't.</i></b>

18:13.880 --> 18:15.450
<b><i>A delayed effect?</i></b>

18:15.990 --> 18:17.530
<b><i>So it must have been then!</i></b>

18:23.910 --> 18:28.330
<b><i>Does that mean the condition 
was met during the fight?</i></b>

18:29.790 --> 18:31.880
<b><i>What is this number?</i></b>

18:31.880 --> 18:34.250
<b><i>Is it a countdown? A bomb?</i></b>

18:34.760 --> 18:38.150
<b><i>No, the number isn't going up or down.</i></b>

18:39.780 --> 18:41.260
<b><i>This is too much of a pain!</i></b>

18:47.590 --> 18:50.270
<b><i>I only need to destroy the source!</i></b>

18:51.220 --> 18:52.510
<b><i>Something's coming.</i></b>

18:53.700 --> 18:56.280
<b>Despite his overwhelming power,</b>

18:56.630 --> 18:59.200
<b>one reason Youpi was unable to defeat Shoot</b>

18:59.600 --> 19:03.600
<b>was the evident difference in 
skill level between them.</b>

19:08.710 --> 19:11.220
<b><i>It's fast... I can't get away!</i></b>

19:11.800 --> 19:15.050
<b><i>One skewered chunk of meat coming up!</i></b>

19:24.350 --> 19:27.090
<b><i>He hit himself to accelerate.</i></b>

19:27.900 --> 19:29.140
<b><i>Very well...</i></b>

19:31.440 --> 19:32.790
<b><i>That was close.</i></b>

19:33.740 --> 19:37.360
<b>The reaction to the attack told Youpi 
that he could win at any moment.</b>

19:37.810 --> 19:41.460
<b>Youpi wasn't the kind of fighter to rely on strategy,</b>

19:41.460 --> 19:42.940
<b>so this spurred him on.</b>

19:43.960 --> 19:46.600
<b>Youpi's analysis was on the mark.</b>

19:47.160 --> 19:52.030
<b>It was true that Youpi was 
increasingly likely to win this fight.</b>

19:53.220 --> 19:58.180
<b>If he made any mistake, it was not realizing</b>

19:58.180 --> 20:01.170
<b>that Shoot was fine with this fact.</b>

20:27.780 --> 20:29.390
<b><i>I can keep going...</i></b>

20:34.670 --> 20:35.930
<b><i>I...</i></b>

20:37.900 --> 20:40.560
<b><i>can still fly.</i></b>

20:43.890 --> 20:45.010
<b><i>I'm not done...</i></b>

20:47.170 --> 20:51.310
<b>However, quietly and surely...</b>

20:51.310 --> 20:54.010
<b>Shoot was reaching his limit.</b>

21:05.110 --> 21:08.690
<b>Hey, Youpi!</b>

21:12.890 --> 21:15.330
<b>Over here, fool!</b>

21:20.510 --> 21:21.690
<b><i>Knuckle!</i></b>

21:28.550 --> 21:33.480
<b><i>I'm telling him that there's one 
more enemy to worry about?</i></b>

21:34.800 --> 21:35.980
<b><i>That's fine.</i></b>

21:37.010 --> 21:40.230
<b><i>That will serve to distract Youpi,</i></b>

21:40.590 --> 21:43.110
<b><i>and it will save Shoot.</i></b>

21:45.840 --> 21:47.770
<b>Bring it!</b>

21:51.120 --> 21:55.570
<b>After calming down and regaining composure,</b>

21:56.090 --> 21:58.380
<b>Knuckle decided to show himself.</b>

23:25.170 --> 23:27.150
<b>Next time: Duty x And x Question.</b>

23:27.150 --> 23:29.050
<b>Huh? Where are you, Gon?</b>

23:29.590 --> 23:30.430
<b>Over here.</b>

23:30.430 --> 23:32.420
<b>Gon! Wait, you disappeared again!</b>

23:32.420 --> 23:34.360
<b>Perfect Plan... Undo!</b>

23:34.360 --> 23:36.180
<b>I'm always by your side.</b>
