Where's Quinn?

00:07.595 --> 00:09.061
Mr. Sidorov wishes to see you.

00:09.063 --> 00:11.230
What's the job?
Name's Kirkin.

00:11.232 --> 00:12.915
$1 million cash.

00:12.917 --> 00:15.802
<i>Sidorov says that he wants</i>
<i>Kirkin dead.</i>

00:15.804 --> 00:17.213
Who would Kirkin use
for a hit in the U.S.?

00:17.238 --> 00:17.821
One man:

00:17.822 --> 00:20.272
<i>Viktor Varlamov.</i>
I'm being set up.

00:22.610 --> 00:25.411
You did not recover the bombs?

00:25.413 --> 00:26.779
No, they're gone.

00:26.781 --> 00:28.581
Now there's three
nuclear weapons out there.

00:28.583 --> 00:30.466
Sidorov will sell those bombs
to anybody.

00:30.468 --> 00:32.668
<i>A nuclear bomb on the open</i>
<i>market would go for millions.</i>

00:32.670 --> 00:33.786
You let him leave the country?

00:33.788 --> 00:35.120
Sidorov left
on a diplomatic flight.

00:35.122 --> 00:37.306
<i>We're talking about</i>
<i>nuclear weapons.</i>

00:37.308 --> 00:38.891
We're gonna
get this bastard, right?

00:38.893 --> 00:40.643

How would you
describe the way

02:46.771 --> 02:48.354
we settle disagreements?

02:48.356 --> 02:50.389
I apologize, even
when it's not my fault.

02:50.391 --> 02:52.475
Typical male/female dynamic.

02:52.477 --> 02:53.609
Why?

What's your

02:55.363 --> 02:57.146
Quicksand.

02:57.148 --> 02:58.648
No, headhunters, actually.

02:58.650 --> 03:00.316
Headhunters and

03:00.318 --> 03:03.736
in an ant hill,

03:03.738 --> 03:05.604
So, basically,
anything in a Tarzan movie?

03:05.606 --> 03:06.789
Pretty much.

03:06.791 --> 03:08.491
Do you have
reoccurring nightmares?

03:08.493 --> 03:10.042
Just the one with Hetty

03:10.044 --> 03:11.811
What?

03:11.813 --> 03:13.379
What?

03:13.381 --> 03:14.964
I thought everybody had that.

03:16.300 --> 03:18.334
I know Eric does.

03:19.836 --> 03:21.587
That's awkward.

03:21.589 --> 03:22.788
What other job

03:22.790 --> 03:23.889
if you couldn't
be in law enforcement?

03:23.891 --> 03:25.474
Gigolo.

03:25.476 --> 03:26.559
Seriously?

03:26.561 --> 03:28.094
Schoolteacher.
Really?

03:28.096 --> 03:29.595
Who lives a
double life as a gigolo.

03:29.597 --> 03:32.098
Why are you asking me
all these questions?

03:32.100 --> 03:34.016
It's just a... partner survey.

03:34.820 --> 03:36.403
I didn't get one.

03:36.405 --> 03:37.538
Well...

03:37.540 --> 03:38.789
Hey, give it back.
Hold on, hold on.

03:38.790 --> 03:40.768
How would you
describe the way you smell?

03:41.233 --> 03:42.282
What the...?

03:42.284 --> 03:43.517
This isn't from Hetty,

03:43.519 --> 03:45.119
this is from
a bridal magazine.

03:45.121 --> 03:46.320
No, no, this isn't for
partner-partners.

03:46.322 --> 03:47.705
Okay, just
give it back.

03:47.707 --> 03:49.019
I'll-- Forget about it.
No, no, no...

03:49.020 --> 03:50.107
Hold on a second.
What?

03:50.109 --> 03:52.644
Why are you reading bridal magazines?
It was in the Laundromat.

03:52.772 --> 03:55.490
So, you stole it?
Just-- It's from 2007.

03:55.492 --> 03:58.142
Oh, my God...

03:58.144 --> 04:00.244
Your biological clock.
Shut it.

04:00.246 --> 04:01.946
Don't say another word.
That's so funny,

04:01.948 --> 04:03.247
'cause I always thought
that ticking was a bomb,

04:03.249 --> 04:05.299
but it turns out it's you
wanting to make a baby.

04:05.301 --> 04:06.467
Stop it.

04:06.469 --> 04:07.718
You want to
make it with me?

04:07.720 --> 04:08.753
We can make some ninja assassins...
Hi.

04:08.755 --> 04:11.055
Sorry.

04:11.057 --> 04:13.224
Viktor Varlamov was murdered
on the beach this morning.

04:18.296 --> 04:20.982
Tick-tock...

04:23.304 --> 04:25.088
Oh, uh, don't forget to

04:25.090 --> 04:27.140
fill out your partner survey.

04:28.309 --> 04:30.310
We pulled this from
a Venice chess park.

04:30.312 --> 04:33.379
It's the only camera
and the only angle.

04:33.381 --> 04:35.548
You think this is
related to Isaak Sidorov?

04:35.550 --> 04:38.851
Sidorov thinks a rival
Mob boss, Anatoli Kirkin,

04:38.853 --> 04:41.053
hired Varlamov to
assassinate him.

04:41.055 --> 04:42.855
It's one of the reasons
Sidorov fled the country.

04:42.857 --> 04:44.223
Well, maybe he's back.

04:44.225 --> 04:46.025
Sidorov has
three stolen nukes.

04:46.027 --> 04:48.995
Maybe getting rid of Kirkin
and Varlamov is step one.

04:48.997 --> 04:51.364
The killer
made sure not to show his face.

04:51.366 --> 04:52.749
It's as if he knew
where the camera was.

04:52.751 --> 04:55.001
Why didn't he choose a bench
that wasn't on camera?

04:55.003 --> 04:56.119
Proof of the hit.

04:56.121 --> 04:58.204
He staged it so
someone could watch

04:58.206 --> 04:59.905
from a remote location.

04:59.907 --> 05:01.925
Find out who was
watching this feed at the time,

05:01.927 --> 05:04.794
send us everything
you have on Varlamov.

05:04.796 --> 05:06.679
Why don't you see if the killer
left any clues.

05:06.681 --> 05:08.080
Uh, where are you going?

05:08.082 --> 05:11.584
Talk to one of Varlamov's
poker buddies.

05:17.858 --> 05:19.592
Wow.

05:19.594 --> 05:22.445
I believe that falls
under adding insult to injury.

05:26.951 --> 05:28.568
What do you think
this falls under?

05:28.570 --> 05:30.069
Maybe he flipped off
the wrong guy.

05:32.940 --> 05:36.075
The Cyrillic letters are the
English equivalent to S-L-O-N.

05:36.077 --> 05:37.961
What do you
think "Slon" means?

05:37.963 --> 05:40.446
Well, maybe it's the name
of the guy that killed him.

05:40.448 --> 05:42.298
I guess it could be Russian.

05:42.300 --> 05:43.616
Or they could both be parts of
the same puzzle--

05:43.618 --> 05:45.951
you know,
Slon and a missing finger.

05:45.953 --> 05:47.587
Finger and Slon:
Fingerslon.

05:47.589 --> 05:50.056
Fingerstein... <i>das ist,</i>
<i>das ist ein</i> Fingerslon.

05:50.058 --> 05:52.258
I'm so alone.
<i>Das ist ein...</i>

05:52.260 --> 05:54.560
Does this mean we're not looking
for a German Nail Spa?

05:54.562 --> 05:55.961
Kensi?

05:55.963 --> 05:58.264
Huh, <i>liebchen?</i>

05:58.266 --> 06:00.183
The word "Slon," in Russian,

06:00.185 --> 06:02.485
is carved on his forehead and
he's missing his little finger.

06:02.487 --> 06:03.553
Yeah.

06:03.555 --> 06:04.654
We're sending you
a photo right now.

06:04.656 --> 06:06.823
All right, Kens, thanks.

06:06.825 --> 06:09.141
So, whoever killed Varlamov,

06:09.143 --> 06:10.777
he cut off one
of his fingers

06:10.779 --> 06:13.746
and scratched that
into his forehead.

06:13.748 --> 06:15.665
What's it mean?

06:15.667 --> 06:17.149
Slon.

06:17.151 --> 06:18.818
It's Russian for elephant.

06:18.820 --> 06:19.952
So who's the elephant?

06:19.954 --> 06:23.122
"Bay-bar"?
What?

06:23.124 --> 06:24.924
The elephant,
from the kids' book.

06:24.926 --> 06:26.009
You mean Babar.

06:26.011 --> 06:27.927
You pronounce it Babar.

06:27.929 --> 06:28.928
I don't think so.

06:28.930 --> 06:30.329
I have a little girl.

06:30.331 --> 06:31.881
She watches those
Babar movies repeatedly.

06:31.883 --> 06:34.434
It's Babar.

06:34.436 --> 06:37.520
Maybe he changed his name
when he came to Hollywood.

06:37.522 --> 06:39.022
It's Babar, trust me.

06:41.725 --> 06:43.693
Yeah, he looks dead.

06:43.695 --> 06:45.678
Whoever killed him
used an ice pick.

06:45.680 --> 06:47.196
Brutal but effective.

06:47.198 --> 06:49.032
This government issue?

06:49.034 --> 06:51.818
What happened to you
eating healthy, huh?

06:51.820 --> 06:53.119
You two still together.

06:53.121 --> 06:54.570
That's nice.

06:54.572 --> 06:56.572
You've lasted longer
than any of my marriages.

06:56.574 --> 06:58.023
What is secret?

06:58.025 --> 06:59.075
We don't go to bed angry.

06:59.077 --> 07:00.076
I let him drive.

07:00.078 --> 07:01.377
You know who
killed this guy?

07:01.379 --> 07:02.378
Why would I know?

07:02.380 --> 07:04.196
Because I'm Russian?

07:04.198 --> 07:05.548
We all look the same to you?

07:05.550 --> 07:07.166
You think I know everything
every Russian

07:07.168 --> 07:08.551
is doing in this state?

07:08.553 --> 07:09.869
Just the criminals.

07:09.871 --> 07:11.888
That hurts.

07:11.890 --> 07:13.589
Who killed Varlamov?

07:13.591 --> 07:15.892
I don't know.

07:15.894 --> 07:17.009
But you have an idea.

07:18.896 --> 07:20.229
Would his name be Slon,
by any chance?

07:20.231 --> 07:22.432
I don't think so.

07:22.434 --> 07:23.649
So who's the elephant?

07:23.651 --> 07:25.017
Babar.

07:26.720 --> 07:28.404
He's Russian.

07:28.406 --> 07:31.107
In this case,
"Slon" does not mean elephant.

07:31.109 --> 07:32.442
It's acronym.

07:32.444 --> 07:35.578
It stands for
<i>"Suki Lyubat Ostry Nozh."</i>

07:35.580 --> 07:38.081
"Bitches love a sharp knife."

07:38.083 --> 07:40.833
It's old Russian prison code.

07:40.835 --> 07:43.035
Is it prison code to chop
a guy's finger off?

07:43.037 --> 07:46.205
Depends what
is on that finger.

07:46.207 --> 07:47.256
Like a ring?

07:47.258 --> 07:48.708
More like a tattoo.

07:48.710 --> 07:51.761
Valmorov was a <i>Vor,</i>
a thief.

07:51.763 --> 07:54.263
He had thief's
tattoo on his middle finger

07:54.265 --> 07:56.682
to show he is part of
Vory brotherhood.

07:56.684 --> 07:58.684
So, whoever killed him
chopped off his finger

07:58.686 --> 08:00.586
to show he was no longer
in the club?

08:00.588 --> 08:03.106
Something like that, yeah.

08:03.108 --> 08:04.607
Who do you
know that would do

08:04.609 --> 08:07.193
something like this?

08:07.195 --> 08:09.195
Someone who works for someone
who wants him dead.

08:09.197 --> 08:11.781
Someone who
spent time in Russian prison

08:11.783 --> 08:13.566
and is fond of ice picks.

08:13.568 --> 08:15.284
Someone like...

08:16.787 --> 08:18.871
Dmitri Greshnev.

08:18.873 --> 08:23.126
Greshnev left the country
with his boss Sidorov.

08:23.128 --> 08:26.712
Maybe, maybe not.

08:26.714 --> 08:32.618
Either way, I'd definitely say
he's back now.

08:34.505 --> 08:35.972
If Sidorov and Greshnev
are back,

08:35.974 --> 08:37.957
they must have a buyer for the
stolen nukes.

08:37.958 --> 08:41.309
If they're back,
they're coming for my wife.

08:54.465 --> 08:55.849
Michelle, where are you?

08:55.851 --> 08:57.551
We have unexpected guests
from out of town.

08:57.553 --> 08:59.603
You need to call me right now.

09:01.189 --> 09:02.272
Sam!

09:03.309 --> 09:05.025
Last time
you couldn't reach her

09:05.027 --> 09:06.360
was because
of a Christmas play.

09:06.362 --> 09:08.061
Christmas is over.

09:08.063 --> 09:10.297
Sam!

09:11.317 --> 09:12.866
Hey!

09:12.868 --> 09:15.869
I'd still like
to see another one.

09:15.871 --> 09:18.021
What do you suppose
was in that letter?

09:18.023 --> 09:20.073
"Don't look behind you"?

09:20.075 --> 09:22.025
It was probably
just a plant

09:22.027 --> 09:23.410
to lure him there
and distract him.

09:23.412 --> 09:24.745
Well, whoever planted the letter

09:24.747 --> 09:26.363
must have called Varlamov
to tell him to look for it.

09:26.365 --> 09:28.248
Hey, guys.

09:28.250 --> 09:30.519
Yeah, Nell, we need you
Varlamov's phone records.

09:30.544 --> 09:31.135
Will do.

09:31.136 --> 09:32.535
But we just got
a call from Callen.

09:32.537 --> 09:34.388
He thinks Sidorov
and his man Greshnev

09:34.390 --> 09:35.923
may be back
in the country.

09:35.925 --> 09:37.524
Well, it makes sense,
if they killed Varlamov.

09:37.526 --> 09:40.677
Also means
that Kirkin might be next.

09:40.679 --> 09:42.379
If Sidorov is back,

09:42.381 --> 09:43.880
he's probably trying to sell
those stolen nukes.

09:43.882 --> 09:44.882
Where are Sam and Callen?

09:44.883 --> 09:46.350
On their way
to Sam's house.

09:46.352 --> 09:48.018
They can't
reach his wife Michelle.

09:48.020 --> 09:49.987
All right, tell them we'll
go there and meet them.

09:49.989 --> 09:53.573
I'm afraid the two of you
are needed elsewhere.

09:53.575 --> 09:55.993
Our old friend,
Officer Snyder,

09:55.995 --> 09:57.444
from the CIA,

09:57.446 --> 09:59.413
is on his way to the boatshed.

09:59.415 --> 10:02.833
Assistant Director Granger
wants us to partner up with him.

10:02.835 --> 10:05.335
What? Why?

10:05.337 --> 10:08.288
Because if this does involve
Sidorov and the missing nukes,

10:08.290 --> 10:10.874
then it's bigger
than both our agencies.

10:10.876 --> 10:12.242
When you say "partner,"

10:12.244 --> 10:14.211
you mean just
keep him in the loop, right?

10:14.213 --> 10:17.580
I think more like a double date.

10:17.582 --> 10:19.633
What?
Uh...

10:19.635 --> 10:20.851
we're babysitting?

10:20.853 --> 10:23.437
Think of it
as animal control.

10:23.439 --> 10:25.722
I need you
to keep Officer Snyder busy

10:25.724 --> 10:29.426
until Callen and Sam
can get a handle on this.

10:29.428 --> 10:32.396
Do not let him
out of your sight.

11:05.013 --> 11:07.764
What are you doing?
What the hell are <i>you</i> doing?

11:07.766 --> 11:08.899
I was calling you.

11:08.901 --> 11:10.884
I had the vacuum on.
And I could have killed you.

11:10.886 --> 11:12.352
You were wearing headphones.
You're lucky

11:12.354 --> 11:14.938
I didn't crack
your skull open.

11:14.940 --> 11:16.073
So, I take it, we're
all good in here?

11:16.075 --> 11:17.974
Yeah.
No.

11:17.976 --> 11:19.826
Miss Former CIA
was wearing headphones

11:19.828 --> 11:20.911
while she was vacuuming.

11:20.913 --> 11:22.079
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

11:22.081 --> 11:23.246
I'm surprised you even know

11:23.248 --> 11:24.915
we have a vacuum,
because you sure as hell

11:24.917 --> 11:25.832
never use it.

11:25.834 --> 11:27.650
Excuse me?
You heard me.

11:27.652 --> 11:28.869
Now, what are you two doing,

11:28.871 --> 11:30.620
sneaking up in here
like the damn Hardy Boys?

11:30.622 --> 11:31.922
I'm just gonna

11:31.924 --> 11:33.590
run outside and make
a quick phone call, all right?

11:33.592 --> 11:35.175
No, no, no. Wait, G.
Come on, G!

11:36.762 --> 11:39.096
You want to tell me
what's going on?

11:39.098 --> 11:40.797
<i>I was very specific</i>

11:40.799 --> 11:43.800
with Hetty when I told her
I needed to see Hanna.

11:43.802 --> 11:45.552
He's on assignment.

11:45.554 --> 11:47.687
What about his wife?
Michelle?

11:47.689 --> 11:48.972
Does he have more than one?

11:48.974 --> 11:50.474
I don't know.
Does he?

11:50.476 --> 11:53.143
I don't think so.
Cute. You two

11:53.145 --> 11:55.120
really think you can stall
and keep me here all day?

11:55.145 --> 11:55.730
I don't know.

11:55.731 --> 11:57.347
Can we?
How are we doing so far?

11:57.349 --> 12:00.067
We're just trying
to help you, Agent Snyder.

12:00.069 --> 12:02.018
Officer Snyder, and
you two can't help me.

12:02.020 --> 12:05.705
Actually, you could
probably help me.

12:05.707 --> 12:07.074
Mm.
Wow.

12:07.076 --> 12:08.458
Nice.
You don't even look

12:08.460 --> 12:09.576
like you could help yourself.

12:09.578 --> 12:11.711
Wow. Was I just insulted?

12:11.713 --> 12:13.380
Sounded pretty insulting to me.
Definitely condescending.

12:13.382 --> 12:16.199
Almost disdainful.
Borderline supercilious.

12:16.201 --> 12:18.368
Well, I am super silly,
so I guess you got me there.

12:18.370 --> 12:20.971
Point to Poindexter.
High five. See you later.

12:20.973 --> 12:24.091
You're interfering with a
federal investigation.

12:24.093 --> 12:27.727
But we <i>are</i>
federal investigators.

12:27.729 --> 12:30.013
Wait a minute. Now I'm confused.
Who's on first?

12:30.015 --> 12:32.549
Keep it up, but even that
garden gnome you call a boss

12:32.551 --> 12:33.667
won't be able to
save your asses

12:33.669 --> 12:35.652
if you screw the pooch
on this one.

12:35.654 --> 12:37.087
Garden gnomes...
screwing of pooches...

12:37.089 --> 12:38.772
What world do you live in?

12:38.774 --> 12:43.493
Hey, want to see me
dislocate my wrist?

12:45.113 --> 12:47.614
Hey. I sent Varlamov's phone
records to your tablet.

12:47.616 --> 12:49.082
Cool.

12:49.084 --> 12:51.118
Thanks.

12:51.120 --> 12:54.070
How would you describe the way
we settle disagreements?

12:54.072 --> 12:55.589
What disagreements?

12:55.591 --> 12:58.208
Exactly.

12:58.210 --> 12:59.543
What is your greatest fear?

12:59.545 --> 13:01.411
Ooh. The day the
robots turn on us.

13:01.413 --> 13:03.746
Artificial intelligence
run amok.

13:03.748 --> 13:04.965
Nothing scarier.

13:04.967 --> 13:07.601
Agreed. All right.
I already

13:07.603 --> 13:09.352
know your Hetty nightmare, so...

13:09.354 --> 13:12.189
Hmm.
What other job

13:12.191 --> 13:15.025
would you be doing if you
couldn't be in law enforcement?

13:15.027 --> 13:16.476
Is this a test?

13:16.478 --> 13:18.612
It is a partner survey.

13:18.614 --> 13:20.263
Are we getting graded on it?

13:20.265 --> 13:21.531
I don't know.

13:21.533 --> 13:22.566
Professional

13:22.568 --> 13:23.900
Renfair performer.

13:23.902 --> 13:26.436
Oh... my lady
dost knowest me well.

13:26.438 --> 13:28.822
Um, how would you describe
the way I smell?

13:28.824 --> 13:30.157
Yeah.

13:30.159 --> 13:32.409
That's weird.
Little bit.

13:32.411 --> 13:34.461
We're gonna skip that one.
Okay.

13:34.463 --> 13:37.164
What part of my body do you...?

13:37.166 --> 13:38.798
Okay.
What?

13:38.800 --> 13:41.451
This is a partner...
partner survey...

13:44.172 --> 13:46.173
...which we have no business
filling out.

13:50.394 --> 13:51.895
Okay, I'll just keep...

13:51.897 --> 13:52.929
Hey, Callen.

13:52.931 --> 13:54.314
So, no sign of Greshnev

13:54.316 --> 13:55.849
or his boss, Sidorov,
entering the country.

13:55.851 --> 13:58.318
And Eric's still weeding
through IP addresses

13:58.320 --> 14:00.303
logged onto the chess cam.

14:00.305 --> 14:02.989
We did, however, get access to
Varlamov's recent phone records.

14:02.991 --> 14:04.357
Anything stand out?

14:04.359 --> 14:06.526
One new number popped up

14:06.528 --> 14:08.245
two days ago;
looks like a burn phone.

14:08.247 --> 14:10.447
I'm still trying to find out
where it was purchased.

14:10.449 --> 14:12.032
Let me know when you do.

14:12.034 --> 14:13.700
How's everything
with Sam's wife?

14:13.702 --> 14:17.120
Just a little domestic
misunderstanding.

14:17.122 --> 14:18.672
I'll touch base
when we have a plan.

14:26.214 --> 14:28.598
Thanks for having my
back in there, partner.

14:28.600 --> 14:29.966
I will take a bullet for you,

14:29.968 --> 14:31.851
but wives are
a whole other thing.

14:31.853 --> 14:32.936
I'll remember that.

14:32.938 --> 14:34.638
I don't have a wife, so...

14:34.640 --> 14:35.838
You should stop talking.

14:35.840 --> 14:37.607
So, I'm not speaking
from experience.

14:37.609 --> 14:39.976
So you should
<i>really</i> stop talking.

14:39.978 --> 14:43.230
But you won't.

14:43.232 --> 14:45.649
Greshnev doesn't know
where you live.

14:46.784 --> 14:49.018
He knows you as David Forman,
he knows Michelle as Quinn.

14:49.020 --> 14:50.620
He did.

14:50.622 --> 14:52.872
What if Greshnev
didn't just get here?

14:52.874 --> 14:55.075
What if he never left?

14:55.077 --> 14:58.861
We assume he split the
country with Sidorov,

14:58.863 --> 15:00.163
but maybe he stayed behind

15:00.165 --> 15:02.499
to make sure Michelle
killed Kirkin.

15:02.501 --> 15:05.535
If he's been here
the whole time,

15:05.537 --> 15:06.970
he could have made her by now.

15:06.972 --> 15:08.555
It's possible, but...

15:08.557 --> 15:10.307
But what?

15:10.309 --> 15:13.042
If he was here, he had a whole
four months to watch Michelle.

15:13.044 --> 15:14.261
She's careful.

15:14.263 --> 15:15.878
She's a pro.

15:15.880 --> 15:18.014
We all make mistakes.

15:18.016 --> 15:20.267
If Greshnev's been here
all this time, why did he wait

15:20.269 --> 15:22.102
till now to kill Varlamov?

15:22.104 --> 15:25.021
He could have whacked him
a long time ago, right?

15:28.526 --> 15:30.727
We arrested
that guy for murder.

15:46.594 --> 15:47.994
Oh, hell, no!

15:49.847 --> 15:51.731
Sam, no!

15:51.733 --> 15:53.233
Oh!

15:53.701 --> 15:55.285
Sam!
Sam!

15:55.287 --> 15:56.919
Stop! He's one of us!

15:56.921 --> 15:59.856
Who the hell are you?

16:01.592 --> 16:03.693
Officer Sabatino.

16:03.695 --> 16:05.612
We used to work together.

16:05.614 --> 16:07.030
He's with the Agency.

16:07.032 --> 16:09.232
You're CIA?

16:18.278 --> 16:19.645
Just out of curiosity:

16:19.647 --> 16:21.447
What if I wanted
to join the CIA?

16:21.449 --> 16:23.749
Oh, you'd be a good spy.
He's very sneaky.

16:23.751 --> 16:25.317
I prefer stealthy.
Okay, he's very stealthy.

16:25.319 --> 16:26.752
Also, I'm a master
of disguise.

16:26.754 --> 16:28.954
Oh, you should see
his Margaret Thatcher impersonation.

16:28.956 --> 16:30.956
Uncanny.
Uncanny.

16:30.958 --> 16:33.008
Huh? Margaret Thatcher
on a cold day?

16:33.010 --> 16:34.426
Who's gonna see that coming?

16:34.428 --> 16:35.961
Not me.

16:35.963 --> 16:37.046
Hello. It's Maggie.

16:37.048 --> 16:38.931
And then, bam!
Bam!

16:38.933 --> 16:41.216
Except for that sounded a
little bit like the queen.

16:41.218 --> 16:42.468
What?

16:42.470 --> 16:43.552
Hello.
Hello.

16:43.554 --> 16:44.770
Hello.
Hello.

16:44.772 --> 16:46.055
Have you seen my corgis?

16:46.057 --> 16:47.022
They've run amok.

16:47.024 --> 16:49.425
You're both quite comical.

16:49.427 --> 16:51.143
But you know
what's really amusing?

16:51.145 --> 16:53.178
You two think,
by stalling me,

16:53.180 --> 16:55.114
that you're
keeping me here,

16:55.116 --> 16:58.567
when, in reality,
I'm keeping the two of you here.

16:58.569 --> 17:01.487
What? You see that?
He did the double reverse on us.

17:01.489 --> 17:02.538
No. You're good. He's good.

17:02.540 --> 17:03.906
See, that's what
I'm talking about.

17:03.908 --> 17:05.022
Central Intelligence
training.

17:05.025 --> 17:06.208
- Teach me that.
- Oh, me, too.

17:06.210 --> 17:07.492
And if we both join together,

17:07.494 --> 17:08.661
can we get a signing bonus?

17:08.663 --> 17:11.964
Or a... a set of, uh,
commemorative plates?

17:13.800 --> 17:16.001
What is he doing here?

17:16.002 --> 17:18.369
I found Snyder's name
on his collar.

17:18.372 --> 17:19.887
Wait. He works for you?

17:20.373 --> 17:24.076
Vostanik Sabatino.

17:24.078 --> 17:28.347
Sorry I couldn't identify myself
the last time our paths crossed.

17:28.348 --> 17:30.516
You're a spook?

17:30.518 --> 17:31.550
He killed someone.

17:31.552 --> 17:33.619
What was his name?
Brent Bolton.

17:33.621 --> 17:34.987
I didn't kill him.

17:34.989 --> 17:36.488
I was working his wife Mia

17:36.490 --> 17:38.357
as an asset when her husband
came at me with a gun.

17:38.359 --> 17:40.859
He tripped, fell on some stairs,
the gun went off,

17:40.861 --> 17:43.495
and Bolton shot himself.
End of story.

17:43.497 --> 17:45.197
And now she's a widow,
and he's dead.

17:45.199 --> 17:46.915
And you want us to work
with Mr. Sympathy?

17:46.917 --> 17:48.917
I don't. Granger does.

17:48.919 --> 17:50.586
Hey, guys?

17:50.588 --> 17:53.238
A computer at an LA
public library logged

17:53.240 --> 17:54.623
onto the chess park cam

17:54.625 --> 17:56.342
ten minutes
before Varlamov showed up.

17:56.344 --> 17:58.910
Whoever it was logged off
right after he was killed.

17:58.912 --> 18:00.763
I'm guessing
it's not a coincidence.

18:00.765 --> 18:02.965
Nice work.
We'll check it out.

18:02.967 --> 18:04.750
Where is Sam?

18:04.752 --> 18:07.102
He's going back undercover
as David Forman,

18:07.104 --> 18:09.421
as his wife Michelle
goes under as Quinn.

18:09.423 --> 18:11.357
Has Sidorov tried
to contact her?

18:11.359 --> 18:13.726
Not yet,
but if Greshnev's back,

18:13.728 --> 18:15.361
Sidorov won't be far behind,

18:15.363 --> 18:17.262
which means it's only
a matter of time.

18:17.264 --> 18:19.648
And when he does,
we need to be there.

18:19.650 --> 18:22.234
And preferably, without
Sonny and Cher here?

18:22.236 --> 18:24.153
Yeah, that's not gonna happen.

18:24.155 --> 18:27.072
I got you, babe.

18:32.662 --> 18:35.464
You know I was doing this
before you were.

18:37.884 --> 18:40.886
And you've been out
of it for a while.

18:40.888 --> 18:44.006
And when we decided to
have a family, we agreed...

18:44.008 --> 18:46.958
What, that I'd give up my life?

18:46.960 --> 18:50.229
You knew I'd go back
to work eventually.

18:50.231 --> 18:53.465
Not for Isaak Sidorov.
Why?

18:53.467 --> 18:54.817
Why do you think?

18:54.819 --> 18:55.934
Because it's too dangerous?

18:55.936 --> 18:57.969
Are you kid...?

18:57.971 --> 19:01.907
What do you think I go through
every day you go out that door?

19:01.909 --> 19:03.242
I know. I know.

19:03.244 --> 19:05.360
I know. I'm sorry.

19:05.362 --> 19:07.496
Sorry. I can't help it.

19:07.498 --> 19:09.147
And if it's not Sidorov,

19:09.149 --> 19:13.318
it's going to be someone else
just like him, or worse.

19:14.170 --> 19:16.004
This is what I do, Sam.

19:16.006 --> 19:18.707
It's what we do for our country,
for our daughter,

19:18.709 --> 19:20.709
for each other.

19:20.711 --> 19:22.428
I'm glad we're doing it
together.

19:22.430 --> 19:23.995
Hell, most couples are lucky

19:23.997 --> 19:27.499
if they get a date night
once a week.

19:27.501 --> 19:29.000
I like date night.

19:29.002 --> 19:31.019
What's wrong with date night?

19:33.140 --> 19:35.974
At least no one's trying
to kill us on date night.

19:35.976 --> 19:40.011
Well, no one recovered stolen
nukes on date night, either.

19:40.013 --> 19:42.013
Come on.

19:42.015 --> 19:44.182
Let's go get some bad guys.

19:48.571 --> 19:50.823
There is one up side
to all of this.

19:50.825 --> 19:52.825
What's that?

19:52.827 --> 19:54.910
We're on our own
for a few days.

19:54.912 --> 19:56.211
We got work to do.

19:56.213 --> 19:58.547
Oh, no, no, no, no.
I was in prison, remember?

19:58.549 --> 19:59.798
Mm.

19:59.800 --> 20:01.884
Perhaps you should go back.

20:09.175 --> 20:11.877
When did you get back?

20:11.879 --> 20:14.179
Who said I left?

20:15.047 --> 20:16.398
Where's Sidorov?

20:16.400 --> 20:18.183
Where have you been?

20:18.185 --> 20:20.903
We were taking care of
something in San Diego.

20:20.905 --> 20:23.405
Why is he talking?

20:23.407 --> 20:24.206
He's with me.

20:24.231 --> 20:26.146
Why am I talking?
You're in my crib.

20:26.243 --> 20:28.777
I'm guessing he's the reason
Kirkin is still alive.

20:28.779 --> 20:30.829
I haven't had
the opportunity.

20:30.831 --> 20:32.781
Kirkin's paranoid, he's got
more security than ever.

20:32.783 --> 20:34.249
He seldom goes out now.

20:36.068 --> 20:39.872
You have 24 hours
to kill Kirkin.

20:41.708 --> 20:43.041
Impossible.

20:43.043 --> 20:44.793
You tell Sidorov he can

20:44.795 --> 20:46.678
take his money and
find someone else.

20:46.680 --> 20:49.080
He hired you.

20:49.082 --> 20:51.082
You have contract.

20:51.084 --> 20:54.753
Not to honor it would be
an insult and a mistake.

21:17.411 --> 21:18.430
Yep?

21:18.455 --> 21:20.455
Eric, Greshnev just left
the cover house.

21:20.781 --> 21:21.964
Keep him in your sights.

21:21.966 --> 21:23.298
Will do.

21:26.302 --> 21:28.136
Where are you going?

21:28.138 --> 21:29.671
To follow him.

21:29.673 --> 21:31.122
What if he makes you?

21:31.124 --> 21:32.925
He won't.
But if he does, so what?

21:32.927 --> 21:34.459
He'll just think
I'm the jealous boyfriend.

21:34.461 --> 21:36.261
He'd be half right.

21:40.967 --> 21:43.185
I copied the hard drive,

21:43.187 --> 21:44.786
but I doubt we'll find
anything good.

21:44.788 --> 21:46.455
The librarian said
she'd burn us

21:46.457 --> 21:48.323
a copy of the surveillance
tapes from this morning.

21:48.325 --> 21:49.775
Should only take
a few minutes.

21:49.777 --> 21:51.977
Oh, great.

21:52.745 --> 21:54.279
Yeah.

21:55.448 --> 21:56.815
Cop or soldier?

21:56.817 --> 21:58.333
Excuse me?

21:58.335 --> 21:59.668
Your father.

21:59.670 --> 22:02.621
Was he, uh,
law enforcement or military?

22:03.590 --> 22:05.824
Why?

22:05.826 --> 22:08.677
Ah, well, it's just that you,
um... you carry yourself

22:08.679 --> 22:11.296
with a real confidence
and authority.

22:13.349 --> 22:14.633
Are you hitting on me?

22:14.635 --> 22:16.101
No.

22:16.103 --> 22:18.053
Well, maybe a little.

22:18.055 --> 22:19.221
Don't worry, I'm harmless.

22:19.223 --> 22:20.789
In this business?
With our lives?

22:20.791 --> 22:23.275
Hell, I can't even
keep a plant alive,

22:23.277 --> 22:25.844
let alone a relationship.

22:26.345 --> 22:28.096
Plus, I, uh...

22:28.098 --> 22:30.365
I wouldn't want to step
into the middle of something.

22:30.367 --> 22:31.733
Something?

22:31.735 --> 22:33.986
Yeah. Between you
and your partner.

22:33.988 --> 22:36.622
Between me and my...

22:38.492 --> 22:41.526
There is nothing going on
between me and, um...

22:41.528 --> 22:43.712
Deeks?
Yeah.

22:43.714 --> 22:46.214
No. No, no, no, no, no,
we are not a good match.

22:46.216 --> 22:47.382
We wouldn't... we...

22:47.384 --> 22:48.667
we're barely good partners.

22:48.669 --> 22:50.752
That's good.

22:50.754 --> 22:52.220
For him.

22:52.222 --> 22:55.307
Both of you, really.

22:55.309 --> 22:57.225
Does CIA have
mind-control machines?

22:57.227 --> 22:58.310
I wish.

22:58.312 --> 22:59.344
Who shot JFK?

22:59.346 --> 23:00.395
Lee Harvey Oswald.

23:00.397 --> 23:02.931
Who else?

23:02.933 --> 23:04.683
You don't even
know, do you?

23:04.685 --> 23:06.268
Are there aliens in Area 51?

23:06.270 --> 23:08.437
No.
What?

23:08.439 --> 23:10.105
You're smiling.
That's a tell.

23:10.107 --> 23:11.389
That means there's aliens
in Area 51.

23:11.391 --> 23:12.491
I knew it.

23:12.493 --> 23:13.859
I'm smiling out
of the irony

23:13.861 --> 23:15.393
that while I'm
sitting here,

23:15.395 --> 23:17.663
stuck, listening to your
incessant babble...

23:17.665 --> 23:18.563
Why, thank you.

23:18.565 --> 23:19.915
...my partner
is up there

23:19.917 --> 23:21.950
hitting on your
smoking hot partner.

23:21.952 --> 23:23.335
Yeah, well,
doesn't really matter,

23:23.337 --> 23:24.903
he can hit on her all he wants.

23:24.905 --> 23:27.456
The fact of the matter
is that she is a stone cold fox.

23:27.458 --> 23:29.624
Emphasis on "stone cold."
Ah.

23:29.626 --> 23:33.378
Well, just be happy
that she's your partner...

23:33.380 --> 23:35.964
and not your girlfriend.

23:40.753 --> 23:42.387
If you were my partner,

23:42.389 --> 23:43.889
I'd end up falling for you.

23:43.891 --> 23:45.057
Hard.

23:45.059 --> 23:46.274
Then what would I do?

23:46.276 --> 23:47.559
Good partners
are hard to find.

23:47.561 --> 23:48.977
I need someone I can trust
to have my back.

23:48.979 --> 23:50.779
I wouldn't want to lose that.

23:50.781 --> 23:53.031
On the other hand,
you'd also be the person

23:53.033 --> 23:55.233
I cared about more than
anyone else in the world.

23:55.235 --> 23:58.954
And I'd never want to see you
in jeopardy.

23:58.956 --> 24:01.606
So you couldn't possibly
be my partner.

24:01.608 --> 24:03.658
It's a dilemma.

24:05.611 --> 24:07.746
Right, um...

24:07.748 --> 24:10.382
Well, I think... I think it's
stupid, personally...

24:10.384 --> 24:11.449
Ooh.
Excuse me.

24:11.451 --> 24:12.751
What?

24:12.753 --> 24:13.785
Uh...

24:13.787 --> 24:15.554
Sam is following
Greshnev,

24:15.556 --> 24:17.389
and Eric is going to talk us in,

24:17.391 --> 24:19.007
so I thought I should...

24:19.009 --> 24:21.126
You had to come in here
to tell me that?

24:21.128 --> 24:22.310
You couldn't
just text me?

24:22.312 --> 24:23.929
Yeah, no, I definitely--
I could have texted you,

24:23.931 --> 24:24.980
it just seemed
kind of impersonal.

24:24.982 --> 24:26.014
I though maybe we should
ride together,

24:26.016 --> 24:27.065
since we know the streets.

24:27.067 --> 24:28.016
All the more reason

24:28.018 --> 24:29.401
for you to ride with Snyder.

24:29.403 --> 24:31.069
We will follow you.

24:31.071 --> 24:32.821
Right.

24:32.823 --> 24:34.406
Go.

24:34.408 --> 24:36.525
Yeah, all right.

24:36.527 --> 24:38.243
Like the tie.

24:38.245 --> 24:40.078
Sweatshirt.

24:42.031 --> 24:43.999
Case in point.

24:44.001 --> 24:45.483
You still on him, Eric?

24:45.485 --> 24:47.285
Yup. He's about a block
and a half east of you.

24:47.287 --> 24:48.537
He's actually a very courteous

24:48.539 --> 24:50.655
and cautious driver,
for a bad guy.

24:52.659 --> 24:54.209
Are you kidding me?

24:58.297 --> 24:59.281
<i>Eric, stick with Greshnev.</i>

24:59.283 --> 25:00.165
<i>I'm being pulled over.</i>

25:00.167 --> 25:01.466
<i>I'm on it.</i>

25:11.327 --> 25:12.444
Out of the car!

25:12.446 --> 25:13.395
Now!

25:13.397 --> 25:14.646
What?

25:14.648 --> 25:16.514
Let's go!

25:16.516 --> 25:18.083
Hands where I
can see them!

25:20.820 --> 25:24.456
Hands on your head.

25:36.636 --> 25:38.753
Got a gun.

25:44.177 --> 25:46.044
Got another gun.

25:46.046 --> 25:49.764
Got concealed carry permits
for both of those.

25:51.767 --> 25:54.236
You got one for this too?

26:13.455 --> 26:14.789
David Forman?

26:14.791 --> 26:15.873
Yeah?

26:15.875 --> 26:17.074
Your lawyer's here.

26:17.076 --> 26:19.644
It's about time
he showed up.

26:20.445 --> 26:22.497
Hello, Sam.

26:22.499 --> 26:25.216
What are you doing here?

26:25.218 --> 26:27.768
I should ask you
the same question.

26:29.938 --> 26:30.972
The police

26:30.974 --> 26:34.058
found Varlamov's murder weapon

26:34.060 --> 26:37.612
and his severed finger
in your car.

26:37.614 --> 26:38.896
Yeah, Greshnev had me framed

26:38.898 --> 26:40.731
to get me out of the way.
Looks like

26:40.733 --> 26:42.450
he's done an admirable job.

26:43.435 --> 26:44.785
Damn lucky he didn't kill you.

26:44.787 --> 26:46.204
He wouldn't risk Quinn

26:46.206 --> 26:47.388
refusing to kill Kirkin,

26:47.390 --> 26:49.607
or being too distraught
for the job.

26:49.609 --> 26:52.743
Having me arrested
gets me out of the way.

26:52.745 --> 26:54.795
Quinn's used to me
being in jail.

26:56.999 --> 26:58.249
Where's Callen?

26:58.251 --> 27:01.469
I couldn't ask him to come.

27:01.471 --> 27:03.321
Why not?
I didn't want

27:03.323 --> 27:04.922
to damage your partnership

27:04.924 --> 27:06.674
with any ill feelings.

27:06.676 --> 27:08.392
Why would I have ill feelings?

27:08.394 --> 27:11.345
Because I'm not bailing you out.

27:11.347 --> 27:12.897
What?

27:12.899 --> 27:15.132
We can't risk
tipping off Sidorov.

27:15.134 --> 27:16.350
Hetty...

27:16.352 --> 27:18.819
I'm sorry, Sam.

27:18.821 --> 27:20.605
You're safer in here.

27:20.607 --> 27:22.657
I need to be with Michelle.

27:22.659 --> 27:24.575
You have my word

27:24.577 --> 27:28.646
that we will do everything
we can to protect her.

27:30.866 --> 27:32.166
- Hetty...
- Open the gate.

27:32.168 --> 27:34.318
come back here.

27:34.320 --> 27:36.003
Come back!

27:39.291 --> 27:40.791
<i>You what?!</i>

27:40.793 --> 27:44.295
It was in everyone's
best interest.

27:44.297 --> 27:46.430
Clearly not Sam's.

27:46.432 --> 27:48.499
What if something
happens to Michelle?

27:48.501 --> 27:50.268
See that it doesn't.

27:54.056 --> 27:57.024
If this is part of one
of your master plans,

27:57.026 --> 28:00.361
now would be a really good
time to let me in on it.

28:00.363 --> 28:02.480
No, I don't have a plan.

28:02.482 --> 28:04.899
You have no plan.

28:06.652 --> 28:08.286
Perfect.

28:08.288 --> 28:10.404
But I have every confidence
that you and your team

28:10.406 --> 28:11.989
will come up with one.

28:11.991 --> 28:13.524
Sam is part of that team.

28:13.526 --> 28:15.526
Not today.

28:16.428 --> 28:18.996
Adjust and adapt, Mr. Callen.

28:18.998 --> 28:22.583
After all, that is the key
to our survival.

28:32.227 --> 28:34.512
Well, we're obviously
missing something.

28:34.514 --> 28:36.897
What does Sidorov want?
He wants Quinn

28:36.899 --> 28:38.549
to kill his rival, Kirkin,
so he can come back

28:38.551 --> 28:40.101
and sell the nukes
that he stole.

28:40.103 --> 28:41.719
That's it.

28:41.721 --> 28:43.321
I mean, the broad strokes,
yeah, that's it.

28:43.323 --> 28:45.773
No, that's how we get
Sidorov and Greshnev.

28:45.775 --> 28:47.692
Okay, this is gonna
be hard to believe,

28:47.694 --> 28:50.194
but I'm not exactly following
the Kensi logic train.

28:50.196 --> 28:52.663
Apparently, it doesn't make
stops in my neighborhood.

28:53.732 --> 28:54.915
We have a plan.

28:54.917 --> 28:56.917
We do?

28:56.919 --> 28:58.419
Well, let's hear it.

28:58.421 --> 29:00.421
We kill Kirkin.

29:00.423 --> 29:01.789
That's out of the box.

29:01.791 --> 29:04.692
But we don't really kill him.

29:04.694 --> 29:06.761
We make Sidorov and Greshnev
believe Quinn did.

29:06.763 --> 29:08.679
They'll come out of hiding
to pay her off,

29:08.681 --> 29:11.182
and when they do, we track them
back to the stolen nukes.

29:11.184 --> 29:13.417
And what makes you think

29:13.419 --> 29:15.085
that Kirkin's gonna
cooperate with us?

29:15.087 --> 29:16.354
I mean, the guy is
a career criminal.

29:16.356 --> 29:17.421
But he's also

29:17.423 --> 29:18.756
a businessman,
and Sidorov

29:18.758 --> 29:20.307
is a rival, which we
eliminate by arresting him.

29:20.309 --> 29:21.525
That's good.

29:22.778 --> 29:23.944
It could work.

29:23.946 --> 29:25.095
I'll run it by Callen.

29:25.097 --> 29:26.764
Problem is that Sidorov

29:26.766 --> 29:28.199
only gave Quinn 24 hours
to make the hit,

29:28.201 --> 29:29.784
which means it's got
to go down today.

29:29.786 --> 29:31.118
What do we know
about getting to Kirkin?

29:31.120 --> 29:32.119
He travels

29:32.121 --> 29:33.287
with a lot of protection,

29:33.289 --> 29:34.572
but he's also got a bad back

29:34.574 --> 29:36.240
from a bullet he took
a few years ago.

29:36.242 --> 29:38.075
Does a good chunk
of the day's business

29:38.077 --> 29:40.745
at a spa that's a favorite
with Russian Mob types.

29:40.747 --> 29:42.830
I've taken a bullet,
why can't I work from a spa?

29:42.832 --> 29:44.248
He also likes blondes.

29:44.250 --> 29:45.416
All right.

29:45.418 --> 29:47.051
I will wear a wig,
but I will not dye

29:47.053 --> 29:48.118
my hair for this man.
Wouldn't help.

29:48.120 --> 29:49.453
You're not his type.

29:53.175 --> 29:55.526
What's his type?

29:59.264 --> 30:00.481
No...

30:00.483 --> 30:01.799
Really?

30:03.652 --> 30:05.969
Come on.

30:12.811 --> 30:14.078
So?

30:14.080 --> 30:15.913
Snyder's covering the back.

30:15.915 --> 30:16.864
Deeks,

30:16.866 --> 30:18.532
you hear me?

30:18.534 --> 30:19.533
Wow.

30:19.535 --> 30:22.002
Deeks, say something.

30:23.088 --> 30:24.705
Are you there?

30:24.707 --> 30:26.824
Deeks?
Uh... yeah,

30:26.826 --> 30:28.959
I can... hear you.

30:28.961 --> 30:30.344
What are you wearing?

30:30.346 --> 30:31.762
That's not funny.

30:31.764 --> 30:34.164
It's like a gulag
water park in here.

30:34.166 --> 30:37.000
Oh please, how many times
have I had to go undercover

30:37.002 --> 30:39.437
with a low-cut blouse
and a high-cut skirt?

30:39.439 --> 30:41.472
Both of which are more
than I'm wearing right now.

30:41.474 --> 30:43.140
How you doing?
Good to see you.

30:43.142 --> 30:44.675
Oh, really?

30:44.677 --> 30:46.644
Hi... that's-- no.

30:46.646 --> 30:49.063
Uh-huh. Again, not funny.

30:49.065 --> 30:50.231
I'm serious.

30:50.233 --> 30:51.699
I'm pretty sure a naked

30:51.701 --> 30:53.617
Viggo Mortensen's going
to jump out any second

30:53.619 --> 30:54.902
and start pummeling me.

30:54.904 --> 30:56.120
Any sign of Kirkin?

30:59.791 --> 31:03.043
Yeah, he's, uh, surrounded
by a ton of tattooed meat.

31:03.045 --> 31:04.094
Excuse me?

31:04.096 --> 31:06.497
That was a poor choice of words.

31:06.499 --> 31:08.532
All right, this is happening.

31:12.554 --> 31:14.421
Aah!
Oh, that's hot!

31:14.423 --> 31:17.475
You better be talking about
the water and not the scenery.

31:19.261 --> 31:20.895
How you doing?

31:20.897 --> 31:22.713
Like your tattoos.

31:22.715 --> 31:24.098
I mean, I don't...

31:24.100 --> 31:25.900
I don't mean, like,
I like like your tattoos,

31:25.902 --> 31:27.685
I just mean that I appreciate
their artistic merit,

31:27.687 --> 31:29.887
because I, myself, was thinking
about getting a tattoo, you know

31:29.889 --> 31:31.105
like a... like a unicorn,

31:31.107 --> 31:32.857
except for, like,
a really bad-ass unicorn

31:32.859 --> 31:34.108
that's like breathing fire

31:34.110 --> 31:35.609
and he's got nunchuks
and stuff.

31:35.611 --> 31:37.912
I just thought that would
be a good... idea.

31:37.914 --> 31:38.996
Okay, I'm just gonna...

31:38.998 --> 31:40.948
go... wow.

31:40.950 --> 31:42.733
So, invitation only? Yeah?

31:42.735 --> 31:44.919
I just-- I have a proposition
for your boss.

31:44.921 --> 31:48.238
Not much of a talker,
are you?

31:48.240 --> 31:49.790
That's probably
why Communism failed.

31:49.792 --> 31:51.008
Yo, uh...

31:51.010 --> 31:52.626
Mr. Kirkin?

31:54.296 --> 31:56.079
How are you? Hey.

31:57.265 --> 31:58.415
Oh, he said it's okay.

31:58.417 --> 32:01.084
I'm gonna go around.

32:02.605 --> 32:04.855
Whoa, back it up there, comrade,
the last thing you want

32:04.857 --> 32:06.440
is any accidental
underwater contact,

32:06.442 --> 32:09.143
so just give me, like...

32:09.145 --> 32:10.728
Maybe more.

32:10.730 --> 32:12.396
All right, all right,
all right.

32:12.398 --> 32:13.814
Who are you?

32:13.816 --> 32:16.317
Detective Marty Deeks, LAPD,

32:16.319 --> 32:18.516
but I'm currently
working for NCIS.

32:18.517 --> 32:21.011
You're a little out
of your neighborhood, right?

32:21.106 --> 32:23.440
Not to mention my comfort zone.

32:23.442 --> 32:24.792
What do you want?

32:25.945 --> 32:27.110
Well, this is gonna sound funny,

32:27.112 --> 32:29.380
but we actually want
to kill you.

32:30.615 --> 32:32.115
Just let me explain...

32:32.951 --> 32:34.969
Deeks?

32:34.971 --> 32:37.171
Deeks, can you hear me?

32:37.173 --> 32:39.289
Marco?

32:52.848 --> 32:53.908
Deeks?

32:55.875 --> 32:57.492
Deeks?

32:58.850 --> 33:00.930
I'm not waiting any longer.
Tell center I'm going in.

33:02.492 --> 33:04.231
What the hell happened
in there.

33:04.494 --> 33:06.392
Kirkin didn't do it.
Good job.

33:07.087 --> 33:07.701
Thank you.

33:07.702 --> 33:09.455
I was trying to call you.
Are you okay?

33:09.480 --> 33:10.531
You know I just
feel really dirty.

33:10.556 --> 33:11.900
I think maybe,
I just need a hug.

33:11.925 --> 33:13.016
A little snuggle session.

33:13.041 --> 33:14.690
What ya...
Aw.

33:14.691 --> 33:16.803
Ew.
You're like a wet dog.

33:16.828 --> 33:18.447
Cause I had to change
really quickly.

33:18.895 --> 33:21.397
Don't have time to dry
for my own safety.

33:21.399 --> 33:24.000
Funny.

33:24.002 --> 33:26.336
I'll tell Callen
to prep Michelle.

33:26.338 --> 33:28.538
Ouch.

33:30.124 --> 33:32.926
Is anybody else itchy?

33:36.413 --> 33:38.932
I loaded it myself.

34:03.657 --> 34:05.274
Any questions?

34:05.276 --> 34:07.043
Where's Sam?

34:09.213 --> 34:10.913
In a safe place.

34:10.915 --> 34:12.547
<i>Yo, I want</i>

34:12.550 --> 34:15.935
my phone call, man.
This is forcible confinement.

34:17.737 --> 34:19.706
You already
saw your lawyer.

34:19.708 --> 34:22.475
That wasn't my lawyer, man.
I get to speak to an attorney.

34:22.476 --> 34:23.876
You violate
my Sixth Amendment rights,

34:23.878 --> 34:25.478
they throw
my arrest out

34:25.480 --> 34:27.179
quicker than you can beat
an innocent suspect.

34:27.181 --> 34:30.065
Put your hands out.

34:33.637 --> 34:35.237
Thanks, man.

34:42.579 --> 34:44.030
All right, let's go.

34:44.032 --> 34:44.980
You got one call.

34:44.982 --> 34:47.583
Mm-hmm.
Make it quick.

34:51.339 --> 34:54.257
Can I, uh, get you
anything else, sir?

34:54.259 --> 34:56.926
Mm.

34:56.928 --> 35:00.096
Wow! Sorry that I asked.

35:00.997 --> 35:03.182
Did Kirkin just wink at you?

35:03.184 --> 35:05.968
Yeah, that's his way of letting
me know that he's ready.

35:05.970 --> 35:08.170
Uh-huh.

35:18.649 --> 35:20.199
Can I get you a drink?

35:20.201 --> 35:23.036
Vodka soda, please.
Okay.

35:23.038 --> 35:26.489
Where's your restroom?
All the way down on the right.

35:43.540 --> 35:46.476
Eric, I'm sending you
eyewitness footage right now.

35:46.478 --> 35:48.594
<i>Make sure it gets</i>
<i>onto the local news outlets</i>

35:48.596 --> 35:49.429
and onto the Internet.

35:49.431 --> 35:51.564
Tell Callen Sabatino and Snyder

35:51.566 --> 35:53.094
are in position and we're a go.

35:53.095 --> 35:53.613
On it.

35:53.638 --> 35:56.201
LAPD just released
a BOLO for David Forman.

35:57.688 --> 36:00.323
Sam assaulted
a police officer

36:00.325 --> 36:02.275
and escaped lockup.

36:02.277 --> 36:05.161
Good Lord.

36:06.447 --> 36:08.848
♪

36:29.586 --> 36:32.688
♪

36:40.447 --> 36:42.448
I see you haven't

36:42.450 --> 36:44.650
lost your touch.

36:44.652 --> 36:46.936
Where's my money?

36:46.938 --> 36:48.321
On the plane.

36:48.323 --> 36:49.822
What plane?

36:49.824 --> 36:52.775
I have a charter leaving
in 30 minutes.

36:52.777 --> 36:55.745
I'm not going anywhere.

36:55.747 --> 36:57.663
You shot and killed
a Russian Mob boss

36:57.665 --> 36:59.448
in broad daylight.

36:59.450 --> 37:02.284
It might be best for you
to get out of town for a while.

37:03.954 --> 37:04.804
Greshnev's clocking you.

37:04.806 --> 37:06.389
<i>Your boyfriend's</i>

37:06.391 --> 37:07.723
heading back to prison.

37:07.725 --> 37:10.510
There's no reason
to stay.

37:10.512 --> 37:13.729
How'd you know
David got arrested?

37:16.333 --> 37:18.134
I think you've been made.

37:22.022 --> 37:23.606
Take him. Take him.

37:56.557 --> 37:58.925
You set this up.
What are you talking about?

37:58.927 --> 38:01.561
We need to get out
of here-- now.

38:01.563 --> 38:03.563
You're not going anywhere.

38:28.204 --> 38:30.389
He's dead.

38:31.258 --> 38:33.893
How the hell
did you find us?

38:33.895 --> 38:37.212
Michelle's phone.

38:37.214 --> 38:41.350
Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine.

38:45.272 --> 38:48.157
Yes, sir.

38:48.159 --> 38:51.611
No, sir.

38:51.613 --> 38:54.747
I will, uh, pass on
your condolences.

38:58.035 --> 39:00.002
Was that Granger?

39:00.004 --> 39:02.255
Yeah.

39:06.593 --> 39:08.794
Did Snyder have a family?

39:08.796 --> 39:12.181
Uh, divorced. No kids.

39:12.183 --> 39:14.967
Goes with the territory,
I guess.

39:14.969 --> 39:17.970
Any, uh, sign
of Sidorov?

39:17.972 --> 39:20.306
Nothing yet,
but we'll find him.

39:20.308 --> 39:22.058
Losing Greshnev is gonna hurt,

39:22.060 --> 39:24.093
and he's still got three stolen
nukes he's got to sell.

39:24.095 --> 39:26.177
Let's hope we find him
before he finds a buyer.

39:26.284 --> 39:30.336
We have every law enforcement agency
in the state looking for him, so...

39:32.336 --> 39:34.620
Yeah. All right. Well, I...

39:36.206 --> 39:38.273
...I better get going.
I'm being called back

39:38.275 --> 39:40.209
to Washington to head up
a new task force

39:40.211 --> 39:42.444
with the sole purpose
of hunting down Sidorov

39:42.446 --> 39:43.879
and the missing nukes.

39:46.633 --> 39:49.669
Hopefully we can grab
a celebratory drink

39:49.671 --> 39:52.755
when this is over.

39:52.757 --> 39:55.725
Sure.

39:55.727 --> 39:58.311
Sounds great.

40:00.430 --> 40:02.598
Thanks.

40:09.740 --> 40:11.741
Promise me you'll never do that.

40:11.743 --> 40:13.442
What's that?

40:14.277 --> 40:16.162
Get yourself killed.

40:17.030 --> 40:18.414
Well, the good news for you is

40:18.416 --> 40:20.166
I have a natural aversion
to death, so...

40:20.168 --> 40:22.335
I'm not kidding.

40:27.457 --> 40:29.291
Okay.

40:30.160 --> 40:31.927
Okay.

40:31.929 --> 40:33.662
But if I am killed
in the line of duty,

40:33.664 --> 40:34.997
you do me a favor?

40:34.999 --> 40:37.833
Yeah.

40:37.835 --> 40:41.554
Cryogenically freeze me
and put me in your living room?

40:44.776 --> 40:47.943
What on earth would I do
with your dead frozen body

40:47.945 --> 40:49.750
in my living room?
You're right.

40:49.751 --> 40:51.241
I guess the bedroom's
much more intimate.

40:52.784 --> 40:55.382
What? I'm gonna be in
suspended animation--

40:55.407 --> 40:56.686
you wouldn't have to feed me.

40:56.687 --> 40:58.687
It's way better
than an aquarium.

40:58.689 --> 41:00.289
Good night.

41:00.291 --> 41:02.458
You smell like sunshine!

41:05.028 --> 41:07.213
And gunpowder.

41:09.416 --> 41:13.419
Two of my favorite things.

41:13.421 --> 41:16.555
If he's smart, Sidorov will try
and get back out of the country.

41:16.557 --> 41:18.540
Greed trumps common
sense every time.

41:18.542 --> 41:21.594
If he has a buyer for those nukes,
he's not going anywhere.

41:21.596 --> 41:24.013
Well, he may have just
made this easier for us.

41:30.737 --> 41:31.654
Really?

41:31.656 --> 41:33.572
Again?

41:36.660 --> 41:39.195
Am I grounded?

41:39.197 --> 41:42.231
Don't you dare take this
lightly, Sam Hanna.

41:42.233 --> 41:43.699
You didn't trust me.

41:43.701 --> 41:45.567
You didn't trust me either.

41:45.569 --> 41:47.620
Otherwise, you wouldn't have
left me locked up.

41:47.622 --> 41:49.538
It was for your own safety.

41:49.540 --> 41:50.906
I wasn't worried
about my safety.

41:50.908 --> 41:52.007
But I was.

41:52.009 --> 41:54.260
I was trying to protect my wife.

41:54.262 --> 41:56.912
And I was trying
to protect all of us.

41:56.914 --> 41:59.265
Now I have to
try and explain

41:59.267 --> 42:04.970
how Sidorov escaped and why
our only other lead is dead.

42:04.972 --> 42:07.189
What do you want me
to say, Hetty? I'm sorry?

42:07.191 --> 42:08.724
I don't want you
to say anything, Sam.

42:08.726 --> 42:11.026
I want you to go home.

42:12.279 --> 42:16.398
Spend some time with your family
while you can.

42:16.623 --> 42:21.623
== sync, corrected by <font color=#00FF00>elderman</font> ==

42:23.198 --> 42:26.199
This is far from over.
