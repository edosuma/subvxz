00:01.376 --> 00:03.795
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch. We have a 9-11.</i>

00:03.878 --> 00:05.630
<i>Armed robbery in progress.</i>

00:05.714 --> 00:09.676
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

00:09.759 --> 00:11.177
(sirens wailing)

00:16.850 --> 00:19.936
(theme music playing)

01:17.660 --> 01:19.329
MAN (on radio):
<i>...right up until 6:00 a.m.,</i>

01:19.412 --> 01:21.706
<i>Roger Armendale with the traffic report.</i>

01:21.998 --> 01:23.958
<i>Thanks for sticking with me</i>
<i>through the night.</i>

01:24.042 --> 01:26.753
<i>If you've been up all night,</i>
<i>here's the song for you.</i>

01:26.836 --> 01:27.670
(music playing on radio)

01:27.754 --> 01:31.299
<i>For those of you who just got up,</i>
<i>here's how the other half lives.</i>

01:31.382 --> 01:34.177
- <i>The immortal Glenn Miller.</i>
-(radio shuts off)

01:37.263 --> 01:39.307
-(knocking on door)
-RENKO: Hey, Jablonski!

01:39.390 --> 01:41.434
(knocking continues)

01:44.979 --> 01:46.940
Oh, yes. Oh, yes.

01:47.023 --> 01:50.026
-Oh, yes.
-Mm, give me some of that coffee.

01:51.444 --> 01:53.530
-How'd you sleep last night?
-Not a wink, man.

01:53.613 --> 01:56.157
-I was up at two, up at three.
-I couldn't sleep.

01:56.241 --> 01:58.243
I was up cleaning my gear, packing.

01:59.119 --> 02:00.120
Where's Henry?

02:00.495 --> 02:02.247
We're meeting him at the stationhouse.

02:02.330 --> 02:04.290
I said to myself, "Get me out of that car.

02:04.374 --> 02:07.252
Get me out of that job.
Get me somewhere that matters."

02:07.335 --> 02:09.546
Come on. We'll take it in the car.

02:09.629 --> 02:13.508
"Oh, my heart is in the highlands.
My heart is not here.

02:13.591 --> 02:17.929
My heart is in the highlands
a-chasing the deer."

02:19.514 --> 02:20.849
White man, early 30s,

02:20.932 --> 02:23.309
medium-length brown hair,
blue windbreaker.

02:23.393 --> 02:25.353
This is the third armed robbery.

02:25.436 --> 02:28.481
Currency exchange last night,
18th and Prometory.

02:28.565 --> 02:31.442
-White male. Medium height.
-Thanks, Sarge.

02:31.526 --> 02:33.153
-One hundred and fifty pounds.
-Here you go.

02:33.236 --> 02:35.905
-Thanks.
-Medium-length brown hair.

02:36.322 --> 02:38.408
Blue windbreaker.

02:38.491 --> 02:41.411
There will be a bunch
of Boy Scouts in the house today.

02:41.494 --> 02:46.708
The captain will be talking to them
at 1100 hours on law enforcement

02:46.791 --> 02:47.917
as a career.

02:48.334 --> 02:50.003
Anyone who would like to attend is...

02:50.086 --> 02:52.255
Law enforcement as a hobby?

02:52.338 --> 02:54.674
-That's in your case, Flaherty.
-(laughter)

02:54.757 --> 02:56.801
...is welcome. Thank you, Lieutenant.

02:58.928 --> 03:00.805
Oh, the captain was looking for you.

03:00.889 --> 03:05.226
I would like you all to read
and pay attention to the recommendations

03:05.310 --> 03:08.563
regarding the carrying
of a second or backup gun.

03:08.646 --> 03:12.317
You must have the registration
and permission in your file,

03:12.400 --> 03:13.776
and you must qualify with this gun

03:13.860 --> 03:17.155
as well as your service revolver
at the range.

03:17.614 --> 03:19.616
We recommend the backup gun.

03:20.325 --> 03:22.076
And we recommend practice.

03:22.744 --> 03:24.787
The life you save may be your own.

03:25.997 --> 03:26.915
Any questions?

03:26.998 --> 03:29.334
Why is Detective Goldblume
going undercover?

03:29.417 --> 03:30.251
(snickering)

03:30.335 --> 03:32.420
HOWARD: Lieutenant Goldblume
is not working undercover.

03:32.503 --> 03:35.882
For those of you who have kept pace
with the developments in your community,

03:36.549 --> 03:39.344
Sergeant Stan Jablonski,
metro police retired,

03:39.427 --> 03:41.721
is going hunting
with several of our colleagues.

03:41.804 --> 03:43.723
They're going out to kill Bambi.

03:43.806 --> 03:44.766
(groaning)

03:44.849 --> 03:47.727
They're going out to slaughter poor,
defenseless creatures.

03:47.810 --> 03:50.021
Hey, if you can eat it, you can kill it.

03:50.104 --> 03:52.065
Wanna keep your personal life
to yourself, LaRue?

03:52.148 --> 03:53.900
-(jeering)
-HOWARD: All right.

03:54.275 --> 03:58.112
All right, the new rotation
figures on the board.

03:58.488 --> 03:59.405
Uh...

04:00.156 --> 04:02.033
Officer Katherine McBride,

04:02.116 --> 04:05.161
who was sent to Polk Avenue
for special duty,

04:05.245 --> 04:07.038
is back with us for several days.

04:07.121 --> 04:10.375
Please show her every kind courtesy.

04:10.458 --> 04:13.962
-And I thank you for your attention.
-(chattering)

04:15.880 --> 04:17.840
Around the corner, get the car gassed.

04:17.924 --> 04:21.970
-Hey, Sarge! How you doing?
-Just fine. Never better.

04:22.053 --> 04:24.013
Hey, what's it like on the outside, huh?

04:24.097 --> 04:25.682
-You miss it?
-I miss what?

04:25.765 --> 04:27.600
-Police work.
-Worst 30 years of my life.

04:27.684 --> 04:30.353
Time to feed the kitty.
Ante up. Let's go. Let's go.

04:30.436 --> 04:32.021
NEAL: I mean, what do you do all day, huh?

04:32.105 --> 04:34.816
Eat bon-bons and buff my nails.
Don't you have work to do?

04:34.899 --> 04:37.151
Time to contribute to the hunting fund.

04:37.235 --> 04:38.820
Gas, oil, condiments.

04:38.903 --> 04:41.739
Lieutenant, thank you very much.
Thank you very much.

04:41.823 --> 04:43.241
I'll see you later.
I'll be back, I'll be back.

04:43.324 --> 04:44.659
Gotta have two words with the captain.

04:44.742 --> 04:47.829
Oh, quickly as you can, Henry, we gotta
pick up the keys to the hunting lodge.

04:47.912 --> 04:50.581
Sergeant, I need a female officer
for an undercover slot.

04:50.665 --> 04:52.583
-I don't have one.
-Well, can you find me one?

04:52.667 --> 04:54.460
You check when the next rotation comes in.

04:54.544 --> 04:57.672
-Hey, I'm jammed up with this here.
-I can't create a female out of thin air.

04:57.755 --> 05:00.591
If a guy could, it would make
all our evenings more interesting.

05:00.675 --> 05:01.592
(chuckles)

05:01.676 --> 05:04.429
I'll tell you what else you
can't create out of thin air, deer.

05:04.971 --> 05:06.097
Got the technology to kill it maybe--

05:06.180 --> 05:08.808
Sergeant Bates,
if you would allow me a minute.

05:09.475 --> 05:12.979
Women bond together as they do
to raise their consciousness,

05:13.062 --> 05:16.733
to knit, to sew,
to discuss child birth, that's fine.

05:17.317 --> 05:19.777
Why do you find it ludicrous
that men would do the same?

05:20.153 --> 05:22.113
Boys' clubs? Hunting?

05:22.572 --> 05:23.865
No girls allowed?

05:24.198 --> 05:27.243
-So destructive, I don't--
-Oh, do you want to come, Sarge?

05:27.327 --> 05:29.579
-No, thank you, no.
-Then what do you care?

05:29.662 --> 05:30.747
Hey, McBride.

05:31.622 --> 05:33.374
-Good to see you.
-Hello, Lieutenant.

05:33.458 --> 05:36.377
What's new at the Polk? You got a minute?
Buy me a cup of coffee, huh?

05:36.461 --> 05:38.963
-So, what brings you back?
-Light duty, a couple of days.

05:39.047 --> 05:43.468
Get you off the street? Too hot?
I knew they had you in soft clothes.

05:43.551 --> 05:45.219
You know, I'm sorry
you scooted out of here.

05:45.303 --> 05:47.805
-Bounce in, bounce out.
-Yeah, well, I'm sorry, too.

05:47.889 --> 05:50.183
Would've put you undercover here.
Could've used you.

05:50.516 --> 05:51.976
You would pass for anything.

05:52.060 --> 05:54.020
So, where are you
strapped by the way, huh?

05:54.103 --> 05:55.688
Where are you packing?
I can't catch a bulge.

05:55.772 --> 05:58.149
-How are you, Kate?
-I'm doing okay.

05:58.232 --> 05:59.984
Now, you see that?
That's what I'm talking about.

06:00.068 --> 06:01.235
This is what I need here.

06:01.319 --> 06:03.946
Five dollars, I'd say she's not
even carrying a gun on her.

06:04.030 --> 06:05.573
Yeah, she could pass for anything.

06:05.656 --> 06:07.283
I got a little detail
I'm putting together.

06:07.367 --> 06:09.035
You got some time, Kate?
You wanna go talk?

06:09.118 --> 06:11.829
She is talking. She's talking to me.

06:11.913 --> 06:13.664
-I have to go sign in.
-Okay.

06:13.748 --> 06:15.708
Uh, take your time.
I'll catch up with you.

06:17.502 --> 06:18.544
Now what did I say?

06:18.628 --> 06:20.713
Did you see last night's
occurrence sheets from the Polk?

06:20.797 --> 06:22.757
All right, then what am I gonna find?

06:22.840 --> 06:26.052
She shot a man in a gunfight.
IAD pulled her badge and her gun.

06:26.135 --> 06:28.596
Put her on the bow and arrow detail
until after the hearing.

06:28.679 --> 06:30.598
-Did she kill him?
-That's right.

06:34.852 --> 06:36.187
That is a hard one.

06:37.939 --> 06:38.773
What?

06:38.856 --> 06:41.609
Henry, if there were any other
way out of this, I'd take it.

06:41.692 --> 06:43.820
It's an accident I'm even here today.

06:43.903 --> 06:46.489
I have two days off. I just stopped by
to drop off the rotation roster.

06:46.572 --> 06:47.824
I understand. I know.

06:47.907 --> 06:50.451
I'm not gonna order you to do this,
but I'm called downtown

06:50.535 --> 06:53.329
and there are going to be 25 Boy Scouts
here expecting a lecture.

06:53.413 --> 06:55.164
-Somebody has to do it.
-What about Howard?

06:55.248 --> 06:57.875
-Seems tailor-made.
-He's jammed up with overtime monthly.

06:57.959 --> 07:00.920
I'm sorry, Henry.
You'll be through by 11:30.

07:01.003 --> 07:03.881
-The men are waiting in the car.
-Can't you drive up and meet them?

07:05.925 --> 07:07.552
-Henry...
-Yes, sir.

07:07.635 --> 07:09.053
Thank you. Thank you very much.

07:09.137 --> 07:10.721
-Captain.
-I'm coming.

07:10.805 --> 07:11.806
Thank you, Henry.

07:13.766 --> 07:17.061
I'm all packed up and I'm ready to roll.
Let's roll.

07:17.520 --> 07:19.313
Lieutenant Goldblume, here we go.

07:19.397 --> 07:20.690
I'm not going.
I'll have to meet you there.

07:20.773 --> 07:21.816
BOBBY: What?

07:22.150 --> 07:24.652
I'm gonna be tied up here till 11:30.

07:24.735 --> 07:26.279
I'll drive up and meet you there.

07:27.029 --> 07:28.823
I'm just... I'm just...

07:29.615 --> 07:30.533
I'll meet you there.

07:31.909 --> 07:33.327
Get off on 201.

07:33.786 --> 07:38.124
Go east two miles to the corner store.
Make a left.

07:38.207 --> 07:42.211
Four, five miles, come to a yellow house
with a red barn on the right.

07:42.295 --> 07:46.048
You take the next dirt road to the right.
You can't miss it.

07:47.675 --> 07:49.969
Henry, I'm sorry. I'll make it up to you.

07:50.720 --> 07:52.763
-Stan, how are you?
-Captain, how are you?

07:52.847 --> 07:55.224
-I'm sorry to take your boy.
-Oh, he'll catch up.

07:55.975 --> 07:57.435
We'd wait, but we have
to get the keys to the cabin.

07:57.518 --> 08:00.188
No, no, no.
It's all right. I'll meet you there.

08:01.230 --> 08:03.733
"I slept and dreamt that life was beauty.

08:03.816 --> 08:06.611
I've woke and found life was duty."

08:07.195 --> 08:08.654
Henry, since you're here,

08:08.738 --> 08:11.282
wanna stalk the wild request
for overtime with me?

08:11.908 --> 08:13.659
Nothing like a day in the woods, huh?

08:15.369 --> 08:17.205
I'm standing there with a cup of coffee.

08:18.164 --> 08:21.250
Guy comes out with a shotgun from under
his coat, and he starts to speak.

08:21.334 --> 08:23.794
I cannot hear a word that he's saying.

08:24.378 --> 08:26.672
Next thing I'm aware of,
the paramedics are taking him away.

08:26.756 --> 08:28.591
He's still jerking like a fish.

08:29.717 --> 08:31.969
Some guy in uniform takes my gun.

08:32.762 --> 08:36.140
All I can think, guy with a shotgun,
what was he trying to say?

08:36.516 --> 08:39.227
I mean, if you wanna say something,
then speak up!

08:39.602 --> 08:41.687
I've got the image of him.
All I can think--

08:42.104 --> 08:43.606
I want to tell him something.

08:44.065 --> 08:46.067
And then the thought comes
that he's dead...

08:46.817 --> 08:48.569
and then the thought
comes that I killed him.

08:51.447 --> 08:53.783
-I think you're still in shock.
-I'm in what?

08:54.492 --> 08:56.202
I'm in something, I don't know.

08:58.120 --> 09:00.331
-You saw a psychiatrist?
-Oh, yeah.

09:00.414 --> 09:01.666
The whole routine.

09:01.749 --> 09:04.210
-What'd he tell you?
-He didn't tell me anything.

09:04.293 --> 09:05.878
I didn't tell him anything.

09:08.422 --> 09:11.342
You know, it's terrible
when something like this happens.

09:11.425 --> 09:13.302
What happened to the guy,
or what happened to me?

09:14.554 --> 09:15.972
-We could...
-No.

09:17.306 --> 09:18.724
No, I think I just wanna sit here

09:18.808 --> 09:20.851
until they decide
if I'm a criminal or not.

09:28.568 --> 09:30.903
-What?
-BOBBY: Blue pickup, Michigan plates.

09:30.987 --> 09:32.488
-What about it?
-I think we had the plates

09:32.572 --> 09:33.406
on the hot list.

09:33.489 --> 09:35.366
Wrong vehicle.
Put it in neutral, my friend.

09:35.449 --> 09:38.119
Let yourself kick back.
Just say to yourself,

09:38.202 --> 09:40.955
"A man who is only his job, what is he?"

09:41.038 --> 09:44.292
A machine. Not even the machine,
a cog in the machine.

09:44.375 --> 09:46.127
We are not put on this earth just to work.

09:46.210 --> 09:49.297
The word is recreation. Re-creation.

09:49.380 --> 09:50.548
Meditate on that for a second.

09:50.631 --> 09:53.384
Until roll call Monday morning,
we are not cops but men.

09:53.467 --> 09:57.096
Men in the woods.
Men at one with themselves.

09:58.681 --> 10:00.600
-Give me a sandwich.
-BOBBY: Coffee.

10:01.434 --> 10:02.893
STAN: You guys think about the problem?

10:02.977 --> 10:04.312
-I did.
-Tell me.

10:04.729 --> 10:08.482
Deer breaks cover, runs to the crest
of the ridge, we lay low.

10:08.941 --> 10:11.652
-That's obvious.
-Unmoving.

10:11.736 --> 10:13.529
-Wait till the deer's had time--
-Right.

10:13.613 --> 10:16.073
No, that is what we do not want to do.

10:16.616 --> 10:18.868
Deer breaks cover, runs to the crest,

10:19.952 --> 10:22.038
-you've got the advantage.
-BOBBY: Because?

10:22.121 --> 10:24.749
'Cause he can't hear you.
He's running too hard.

10:24.832 --> 10:28.044
The deer's heart is pounding.
He's terrified.

10:28.127 --> 10:29.545
His perceptions are dull.

10:29.629 --> 10:33.174
For one moment, he is playing your game.

10:33.257 --> 10:38.638
The deer is running to the ridge,
the thing you do, you run to the ridge.

10:39.138 --> 10:42.767
Odds are you'll get a shot at him
when he comes up on the other side.

10:42.850 --> 10:44.894
-Another thing.
-Mm, this stuff's good.

10:45.728 --> 10:47.730
Deer breaks cover on the flat.

10:48.064 --> 10:50.775
-Now where are we?
-Let's say we're in the brush.

10:50.858 --> 10:51.984
Here and here.

10:52.068 --> 10:53.694
MAN: Please put your hands
on the dashboard.

10:53.778 --> 10:56.572
Man in the backseat, put your hands
on the back of the seat in front of you.

10:56.656 --> 10:58.491
-Uh, we--
-Just do as I say right now.

10:58.574 --> 11:00.868
-Please.
-Uh, we're police officers.

11:00.951 --> 11:03.537
Right now, please! Right now!

11:10.336 --> 11:11.253
Oh.

11:12.088 --> 11:14.965
I find an unfortunate
aspect of our society

11:15.049 --> 11:19.303
is the absence of an alternative
means of establishing status.

11:19.970 --> 11:20.805
Uh-huh.

11:20.888 --> 11:23.974
Yes, there is a certain status
structure in any job.

11:24.058 --> 11:26.227
Who is the boss? Who is the underling?

11:26.310 --> 11:28.938
And a too close adherence
to that structure

11:29.021 --> 11:31.190
causes jealousy of those above

11:31.857 --> 11:33.984
and an indifference towards those below.

11:34.485 --> 11:37.988
-Which is why the company baseball--
-I've got to write a talk.

11:38.072 --> 11:39.407
Well, let me just make this point.

11:39.490 --> 11:42.118
You see, I think the fact
that you are going hunting

11:42.201 --> 11:43.786
with men below, while some may say

11:43.869 --> 11:47.623
that is a violation
of the status structure, I--

11:47.707 --> 11:51.919
I've got to talk to 25 Boy Scouts
in half an hour.

11:53.921 --> 11:54.755
Oh.

11:58.384 --> 12:01.470
-Yes?
-Would you talk to this woman, please?

12:04.473 --> 12:05.725
I'm Lieutenant Goldblume.

12:06.225 --> 12:09.019
-I'm--
-If you have just five minutes, sir.

12:17.445 --> 12:18.696
-Miss...
-Fletcher.

12:18.779 --> 12:19.864
Oh.

12:19.947 --> 12:25.494
-Miss Fletcher, I have about five minu--
-I'll be brief. I, uh--

12:25.870 --> 12:28.998
Many people are struck by the, uh, by--

12:29.373 --> 12:31.625
by what happens in the cities.

12:31.709 --> 12:35.296
You-you think it will not affect you.

12:35.379 --> 12:39.300
You-- People cannot stand the stress.

12:39.383 --> 12:43.137
And you look at people around you

12:43.220 --> 12:45.014
and you see what happens to them

12:45.097 --> 12:47.767
and you say it won't happen to you.

12:47.850 --> 12:51.479
Miss Fletcher,
what specifically is your complaint?

12:52.480 --> 12:53.522
My...

12:56.776 --> 12:58.694
My boyfriend won't make love to me.

13:01.322 --> 13:03.157
They said the way to do it,
they developed a drill--

13:03.240 --> 13:04.867
Thing is, never give up the gun.

13:04.950 --> 13:06.702
-Statistics say never give up the gun.
-Never give up the gun.

13:06.786 --> 13:07.745
That's what I'm saying.

13:07.828 --> 13:09.622
-So they developed this drill--
-I've heard of this.

13:09.705 --> 13:11.791
-You know what I'm talking about.
-Man gets a drop on your partner,

13:11.874 --> 13:13.793
gets your partner's gun,
you work out a signal.

13:13.876 --> 13:15.628
-Call him by--
-Call him by a strange name.

13:15.711 --> 13:18.631
Say for example,
"Clarence, give him what he wants."

13:18.714 --> 13:20.674
Well, the word "Clarence" is the signal.

13:20.758 --> 13:21.842
-He drops--
-Your partner drops.

13:21.926 --> 13:25.137
Your partner hears that word,
he drops to the ground, you draw and fire.

13:25.221 --> 13:27.765
-Chances that's gonna work?
-Idea is to die on your feet.

13:27.848 --> 13:29.225
-That's right.
-To die with a gun in your hand.

13:29.308 --> 13:30.893
-That's right.
-Rather than go out on your knees.

13:30.976 --> 13:33.229
-I vote for that any day.
-That situation can always get worse.

13:33.312 --> 13:35.856
Some sucker gets a drop on me,
I'm gonna shoot it out right there.

13:35.940 --> 13:38.025
Okay, word is, my cousin
says when you get there,

13:38.108 --> 13:39.652
you work your way back from the dry creek.

13:39.735 --> 13:42.780
Three quarters of a mile back,
there's a broken down stone fence.

13:42.863 --> 13:44.198
That's where he got his deer last year.

13:44.281 --> 13:46.158
-Hey, man, we appreciate it.
-My pleasure.

13:46.242 --> 13:47.159
No, no, no, that's on us.

13:47.243 --> 13:48.452
-Thanks for the advice.
-Thank you.

13:48.536 --> 13:50.454
You just keep looking for
that stone fence.

13:50.538 --> 13:52.081
And why did you pull us over?

13:52.540 --> 13:55.668
Well, my partner thought
you looked a tad suspicious.

13:55.751 --> 13:57.211
We've been having some burglaries.

13:57.294 --> 13:59.588
I said, "No, they're just going
to a costume party."

13:59.672 --> 14:00.589
Costumes?

14:00.673 --> 14:02.591
-No, these are our hunting clothes.
-Uh-huh.

14:02.675 --> 14:04.677
It's always good to show
a little class in the woods.

14:04.760 --> 14:08.097
Stone fence 3/4 of a mile back,
dry creek bed.

14:08.180 --> 14:10.015
We'd better hit it.
We got to pick up those keys.

14:10.099 --> 14:12.560
-Thanks for the advice.
-Always glad to help a fellow officer.

14:12.643 --> 14:13.644
(laughs)

14:14.353 --> 14:15.896
My name is Henry Goldblume.

14:15.980 --> 14:18.691
I'm a lieutenant
of the Metropolitan Police.

14:20.150 --> 14:23.737
It might look as if I'm involved
in some undercover mission,

14:23.821 --> 14:26.574
but I'm dressed like this
for a simpler reason.

14:26.657 --> 14:27.658
It's my day off.

14:29.952 --> 14:34.415
I'm speaking to you today
because you have expressed an interest

14:34.498 --> 14:36.959
in law enforcement as a career.

14:37.042 --> 14:39.503
Law enforcement as a career.
Now, what does this mean?

14:41.213 --> 14:43.173
It means many things.

14:43.257 --> 14:48.596
It means a career which offers
friendship, loyalty,

14:49.054 --> 14:51.265
from those around you
and to those around you...

14:52.766 --> 14:53.767
and pride.

14:55.686 --> 14:56.770
Service.

14:57.605 --> 15:00.232
And as I've been reminded here today...

15:01.233 --> 15:02.192
duty.

15:02.818 --> 15:04.820
And this is what
I would like to say to you.

15:05.821 --> 15:10.326
I'm speaking to you
not as children now but as men.

15:10.659 --> 15:12.620
Because you've done us
the favor of coming here today

15:12.703 --> 15:14.121
to see the way we live.

15:14.622 --> 15:16.707
We are here to enforce the law.

15:16.999 --> 15:21.170
To serve and protect the populous
in need of service and protection.

15:21.545 --> 15:23.213
It is their will,

15:24.214 --> 15:26.967
the will of the people
expressed in the laws of city

15:27.051 --> 15:29.011
and the regulations of the department

15:30.346 --> 15:32.181
that controls our life.

15:33.098 --> 15:36.602
The bad cop, straining against that will,

15:36.685 --> 15:40.731
he bends the laws,
he flaunts the rules of the department,

15:40.814 --> 15:43.609
and his life in the force
will be an unhappy one.

15:44.485 --> 15:45.778
Because this man

15:47.154 --> 15:48.781
forgoes the one,

15:48.864 --> 15:52.368
the only constant satisfaction
he could have...

15:54.912 --> 15:58.290
the satisfaction of doing his duty.

16:06.048 --> 16:07.466
It's all locked.

16:07.549 --> 16:09.718
Well, dang it, why'd those Statey's
have to stop us for anyway?

16:09.802 --> 16:11.804
-We missed our connection.
-Can we catch up with your guy?

16:11.887 --> 16:13.305
-Get the keys?
-No, he's gone.

16:13.389 --> 16:14.765
Where does he usually hide the keys?

16:14.848 --> 16:16.517
I don't know. This is my first time here.

16:16.600 --> 16:17.810
You've never been here before?

16:17.893 --> 16:20.562
The man's my linesman
from the old days at the Polk.

16:20.646 --> 16:22.147
He says, "Use my cabin."

16:22.231 --> 16:24.817
Gentlemen, I think the correct
answer here is break in.

16:24.900 --> 16:26.986
We will break in. We will unlock the door.

16:27.069 --> 16:28.904
Prior to leaving,
we will seal the window with wood

16:28.988 --> 16:31.615
and leave your friend ample
funds to re-glaze his window.

16:31.699 --> 16:32.741
...please.

16:47.381 --> 16:49.550
Now the thing is, chop wood.

16:49.633 --> 16:52.302
-Chop wood for--
-For the heat the house, my friend,

16:52.386 --> 16:54.054
for we are in the country now.

16:54.138 --> 16:56.849
Well, your friend from the Polk
doing some well for himself.

17:03.856 --> 17:06.775
Well, we're just gonna have
to take the bitter with the better.

17:07.609 --> 17:10.612
-Let's get unpacked.
-Stan, does this mean no chopping wood?

17:10.696 --> 17:12.740
RENKO: Man, I may not even
go hunting tomorrow.

17:12.823 --> 17:16.535
I might just stay right here
and order up a deer.

17:16.618 --> 17:17.619
Well...

17:18.328 --> 17:19.872
break out the cards

17:20.372 --> 17:23.250
-and let's get into this weekend.
-Yeah.

17:23.333 --> 17:25.294
-Lieutenant?
-Yeah, catch me later.

17:28.005 --> 17:29.798
-McBride.
-Yeah.

17:30.591 --> 17:32.509
-Hiya.
-Hi.

17:33.510 --> 17:36.597
How you feeling? Nah, can that.
You feel like you look.

17:37.514 --> 17:39.850
Uh, come here. I wanna tell you something.

17:41.643 --> 17:43.687
(indistinct chatter)

17:53.655 --> 17:56.033
I read in the report
how you shot that guy last night.

17:56.116 --> 17:57.868
I don't wanna talk about the shooting.

17:57.951 --> 18:00.537
Well, I do. So shut up or sign out
and go home, you got me?

18:00.621 --> 18:02.706
You're a hero the way you catch him.

18:03.248 --> 18:05.125
And then they treat you like you're a dog.

18:06.543 --> 18:08.462
Don't look down at me
when I'm talking to you.

18:08.545 --> 18:09.755
You know what a hero is?

18:10.547 --> 18:12.299
You are a hero.

18:13.509 --> 18:15.677
-What's it to you?
-What's it to me?

18:15.761 --> 18:18.305
What's it to me? Two things:

18:18.764 --> 18:22.017
One, some point,
I need an undercover female officer.

18:22.101 --> 18:24.228
When you spring out of this,
I'd like it to be you.

18:24.311 --> 18:25.729
Two, I'm a cop.

18:26.230 --> 18:29.024
I'm the only person in the whole world
who gives a single damn about you.

18:29.108 --> 18:31.652
So why don't you pack it away,
kid, and stand up straight?

18:33.904 --> 18:37.324
This is a cop talking to you.
This is one of your own talking to you.

18:37.407 --> 18:39.952
And I say I may have
to reach out for you soon,

18:40.035 --> 18:42.329
so why don't you stand up
straight and shrug it off?

18:42.412 --> 18:44.414
-The IAD--
-The IAD is gonna clear you.

18:44.498 --> 18:46.667
-How do you know?
-How do I know?

18:47.167 --> 18:49.211
Because I read the reports. And, two...

18:50.003 --> 18:52.256
-I see it in your eyes.
-You see what?

18:52.339 --> 18:54.258
I see that you did the right thing.

18:54.341 --> 18:56.593
-I did the right thing?
-That's right.

18:57.386 --> 18:59.179
Then why do I feel the way that I do?

18:59.263 --> 19:01.557
-You want me to tell you?
-Yes.

19:03.767 --> 19:05.144
Because you liked it.

19:05.853 --> 19:08.021
Don't turn away.
This is a lieutenant talking to you,

19:08.105 --> 19:10.065
so you just listen to what I'm gonna say.

19:11.483 --> 19:13.026
You just got out of combat.

19:13.527 --> 19:15.904
Lasted two minutes.
Doesn't make a difference.

19:15.988 --> 19:18.740
You did something that
few people in this world do.

19:18.824 --> 19:21.368
You stood up to
another human being in combat

19:21.451 --> 19:25.080
where it was his life or yours,
and you're the one that walked away.

19:32.880 --> 19:35.841
I've been there, kid.
I've been where you've been.

19:35.924 --> 19:37.843
And the guilty secret is

19:38.927 --> 19:42.222
it is the greatest exhilaration
that is possible to know.

19:42.890 --> 19:46.143
Society says you go feel contrite,
so you feel contrite.

19:46.226 --> 19:48.437
But deep down inside, you say this,

19:49.813 --> 19:53.025
"My God, I'm afraid that I liked it."

19:53.692 --> 19:55.736
-(scoffs)
-Uh-uh. I'm not done yet.

19:56.195 --> 19:59.740
A healthy society, they'd say,
"Thank you, Officer, for doing your duty.

19:59.823 --> 20:02.117
Thank you very much.
You put the thing behind you."

20:02.784 --> 20:03.869
Not here.

20:04.328 --> 20:06.872
Here, they treat you
like a criminal, they shun you,

20:06.955 --> 20:08.790
and then you feel like you're a monster.

20:08.874 --> 20:10.334
You want ten years' worth
of psychotherapy?

20:10.417 --> 20:11.960
Here, you say this to me,

20:12.544 --> 20:14.963
you say, "Norm, I liked it."

20:15.881 --> 20:17.758
Go on, say it. 'Cause you know it's true.

20:19.593 --> 20:20.636
Norm...

20:22.179 --> 20:23.180
I liked it.

20:23.680 --> 20:25.557
That's what you think, you dumb fool.

20:25.641 --> 20:28.018
You were scared crazy,
and you're lucky that you're alive.

20:28.101 --> 20:29.561
-MAN: Lieutenant?
-But you did your duty,

20:29.645 --> 20:31.605
and so I say, "Good for you."

20:31.688 --> 20:33.065
Lieutenant.

20:33.148 --> 20:35.108
-Here, come with me.
-Where are we going?

20:35.192 --> 20:37.778
We are going to quell the disturbance.

20:38.195 --> 20:40.197
-I'm supposed to--
-You do what you're supposed to do.

20:40.280 --> 20:41.740
It's the mark of a gentleman.

20:42.449 --> 20:44.201
I am not here. I am going hunting.

20:44.284 --> 20:45.994
-I--
-No, no, no, Patrick, really.

20:46.078 --> 20:47.829
Whatever it is, save it for Monday.

20:47.913 --> 20:50.082
I was just gonna wish you good shooting.

20:50.707 --> 20:53.210
-Thank you, Patrick.
-(mimics gunshots)

20:53.293 --> 20:56.797
Handling the Boy Scouts.
Woman's boyfriend won't make love to her.

20:58.048 --> 20:59.675
Overtime.

20:59.758 --> 21:01.218
Hm, you shoot 'em, Lieutenant,

21:01.301 --> 21:04.179
-'cause they'd do the same to you.
-Goodbye, goodbye.

21:04.263 --> 21:05.681
Free at last.

21:06.139 --> 21:09.851
Goodbye, wage slaves. It's vacation time.

21:12.688 --> 21:13.647
That's the man!

21:14.273 --> 21:16.650
That's the man that raped me!

21:16.733 --> 21:19.403
He raped me in his office!

21:19.736 --> 21:22.531
I came here for help! I...

21:24.157 --> 21:25.826
Is no one listening to me?!

21:27.077 --> 21:29.037
I wanna file a report!

21:38.422 --> 21:40.674
-Two cards.
-Two cards.

21:40.757 --> 21:42.676
-Similarly.
-Two cards for the man.

21:42.759 --> 21:45.178
And the dealer takes, uh...

21:45.512 --> 21:48.807
-Fronting off, as usual.
-And time will tell.

21:49.850 --> 21:51.893
And, Stan, I believe it's your bet.

21:52.477 --> 21:54.271
-My bet?
-Mm-hmm.

21:54.354 --> 21:57.524
All right, discretion being
the better part of valor,

21:57.607 --> 21:59.901
I will bet, uh...

22:00.694 --> 22:02.487
How much money you got in front of you?

22:03.113 --> 22:05.991
-Thirty-five, um--
-That's my bet.

22:06.533 --> 22:07.743
Thirty-five dollars.

22:10.037 --> 22:12.622
Why did those Statey's
stop us in that car?

22:12.706 --> 22:14.666
I mean, I know
they said some burglaries--

22:14.750 --> 22:17.377
Come on, man, what is more
suspicious-looking than a cop?

22:17.461 --> 22:19.379
A thief don't even look
as suspicious as a cop.

22:19.463 --> 22:21.506
-Thirty-five dollars.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

22:21.590 --> 22:23.133
I'm thinking about it.

22:24.718 --> 22:26.762
-(door opens)
-(giggling)

22:40.859 --> 22:42.986
-(woman moans)
-Is that your guy?

22:48.283 --> 22:49.451
-Sir.
-(woman gasps)

22:49.534 --> 22:52.245
What are you doing? Who are you?
What-- what are you doing here?

22:52.329 --> 22:54.247
WOMAN:
Don't talk to them. Just call the police.

22:54.331 --> 22:56.625
Now, hold on. We are police. Just hold it.

22:56.708 --> 22:58.335
-Hold it!
-Hold it for God's sake!

23:01.630 --> 23:04.716
-Now, who are you?
-No, who are you?

23:05.050 --> 23:06.968
We're friends of John Swaboata.

23:07.052 --> 23:08.512
And who is John Swaboata?

23:08.595 --> 23:10.430
Is this John Swaboata's cabin?

23:11.139 --> 23:12.891
-No, it's not. It's my cabin.
-And you are?

23:12.974 --> 23:15.394
Who I am? It's none of your business
who I am. You're in my home.

23:15.685 --> 23:18.271
What are you guys, you're police officers?

23:18.522 --> 23:19.356
Yes, sir.

23:19.439 --> 23:21.650
Then I think you'd better give me
your names and badge numbers, guys.

23:21.733 --> 23:24.903
Um, could I talk to you a moment, sir?

23:24.986 --> 23:26.905
Could I talk with you
a moment, please, sir?

23:35.956 --> 23:38.333
(whooping)

23:39.292 --> 23:40.752
How did you get us out of that?

23:40.961 --> 23:43.630
Guy had a wedding ring on. Woman did not.

23:43.713 --> 23:46.299
I thought he didn't kiss her
like the two of them were married.

23:46.383 --> 23:50.011
So, it seems all of us
gonna forgive and forget.

23:50.095 --> 23:52.806
So, if we've got the wrong place,
how is Henry gonna find us?

23:52.889 --> 23:55.600
And where is our hunting lodge?

24:08.947 --> 24:09.865
(car door shuts)

24:15.036 --> 24:16.705
Does anybody wanna chop some wood?

24:20.125 --> 24:22.043
-I'm very sorry.
-Not at all, not at all.

24:22.127 --> 24:23.795
I just don't know.

24:24.212 --> 24:25.922
I don't know what happened to my life.

24:26.006 --> 24:28.175
-We're sorry to embarrass you.
-No, you didn't embarrass me.

24:28.258 --> 24:30.302
-Look, I'm sure nothing will come of it.
-Nothing will come of it?

24:30.385 --> 24:31.720
Of course nothing will come of it.

24:31.803 --> 24:33.889
He was in a glassed-in room
with an open door.

24:33.972 --> 24:35.849
He was with this woman
for something under five minutes,

24:35.932 --> 24:38.310
-and it was in full view of everyone.
-Look, I'm on my day off.

24:38.393 --> 24:40.437
Whatever the thing is,
let's talk about it

24:40.520 --> 24:43.315
-if we have to talk about it next week.
-Absolutely.

24:47.235 --> 24:48.445
Aw, hell.

24:49.946 --> 24:52.949
Can anybody lend me $20?

24:53.825 --> 24:57.162
Can-- Let's not all rush up here at once.

24:57.746 --> 24:59.539
Look, people, I'm on vacation.

24:59.623 --> 25:02.584
I gave Renko my money.
I have no money for gas.

25:02.667 --> 25:05.086
-Sorry, Lieutenant.
-(sighs)

25:05.170 --> 25:07.422
Can anybody cash a check for me?

25:13.803 --> 25:15.472
-BOBBY: Whoo!
-(door shuts)

25:15.555 --> 25:18.016
Oh, working up a chill out there.

25:18.683 --> 25:21.561
STAN: You think it's cold now,
wait till 5:00 a.m.

25:21.645 --> 25:22.896
Well, this is the life, man.

25:22.979 --> 25:25.607
I don't care, man, Henry,
you are missing it.

25:25.690 --> 25:29.361
Yep, this is something
more like hunting here.

25:29.653 --> 25:31.321
-Thank you.
-(exhales sharply)

25:31.905 --> 25:33.406
-Mm.
-You don't wanna drink too much of that.

25:33.490 --> 25:35.200
-Nope.
-You wanna hit the hay.

25:35.283 --> 25:38.495
Bright-eyed and bushy tailed, 4:00 a.m.,
get the jump on some sleepy deer.

25:40.330 --> 25:42.165
BOBBY: Funny how things come back.

25:42.249 --> 25:43.291
What is it?

25:43.750 --> 25:47.796
Sitting around here,
cleaning the rifles, wood in the fire.

25:48.672 --> 25:51.466
-Hmm. Smell of oil.
-That's right.

25:53.093 --> 25:54.135
(sighs)

25:54.928 --> 25:57.889
I remember one time, '69... '70?

25:59.558 --> 26:01.643
We were, uh, a bunch of us,

26:01.726 --> 26:05.522
we were on a ridge
about ten kilometers north...

26:06.022 --> 26:07.899
MAN: There's nothing to talk about.

26:07.983 --> 26:09.651
Hey, he's your brother, you tell him.

26:09.734 --> 26:11.653
You tell him he can get
someone else to work nights.

26:11.736 --> 26:13.947
-That's four time in six--
-Sir?

26:14.364 --> 26:15.532
-Sir?
-Well, find out.

26:15.615 --> 26:17.450
-I'd like to cash a check.
-Call me back.

26:18.118 --> 26:19.953
-Sir? Sir?
-Yeah, okay.

26:21.913 --> 26:24.124
-Sir, I'd like to cash a check.
-I--

26:24.207 --> 26:27.294
I don't have an account here,
but I'm a police officer.

26:27.377 --> 26:30.213
Oh, thank God, thank God.
I just-- I was waiting.

26:30.297 --> 26:32.465
-I just-- I was almost held up.
-No.

26:32.549 --> 26:35.176
-Yes.
-Look, did you call it in?

26:35.260 --> 26:39.055
-What do you mean you were almost held up?
-The circular. The bandit.

26:39.139 --> 26:41.766
-He came in the store.
-How long ago was this?

26:41.850 --> 26:44.769
-Ten minutes ago.
-He's gone by now.

26:45.937 --> 26:48.398
-I'm sure these officers--
-Lieutenant.

26:48.481 --> 26:50.442
Pure coincidence. I just walked in.

26:50.525 --> 26:51.901
You boys know the drill.

26:51.985 --> 26:54.863
I want you to pay special attention
to this man's complaint.

26:54.946 --> 26:56.990
-Thank you. Thank you, sir.
-Fine, fine.

26:57.073 --> 26:59.618
Sir, if you could just... before you...

27:00.327 --> 27:02.037
if you could just do me the favor...

27:05.582 --> 27:07.626
(whistling)

27:21.056 --> 27:23.266
Drive me out of here,
and drive me out of here fast.

27:23.350 --> 27:25.143
STAN: 1943.

27:26.269 --> 27:27.896
And we were, uh...

27:29.522 --> 27:32.025
-we were dropped into Yugoslavia.
-Uh-huh.

27:32.108 --> 27:35.278
And we were captured.

27:35.362 --> 27:36.988
Never knew you were
with the airborne, Sarge.

27:37.072 --> 27:39.491
Well, I was. And I don't know what it was.

27:39.574 --> 27:42.118
The pilot got it wrong,
intelligence was wrong,

27:42.202 --> 27:46.331
but we ran into an advanced unit
of the German V Corps.

27:48.291 --> 27:51.044
And they, um,
there was some talk about it.

27:52.379 --> 27:54.589
Uh, there were four of us
that they caught.

27:55.757 --> 27:57.717
And they told us they were going to...

27:58.259 --> 27:59.427
Well, they tied us up.

27:59.969 --> 28:01.721
Uh, they were in a barn.

28:02.097 --> 28:03.598
An old horse barn.

28:03.682 --> 28:04.599
Stone.

28:05.725 --> 28:08.436
And we said,
"What are you gonna do with us?"

28:09.562 --> 28:12.482
And they said
that the next day when they left,

28:12.565 --> 28:16.486
they'd be taking us
to-to their base camp as prisoners.

28:17.278 --> 28:20.448
They left us under the guard
of this young kid-- young kid. (chuckles)

28:23.284 --> 28:25.078
He was just a little younger than us.

28:26.871 --> 28:27.997
He must have been 20.

28:30.834 --> 28:31.876
And the kid was...

28:34.838 --> 28:36.923
Uh, he knew they were gonna
kill us in the morning.

28:39.134 --> 28:40.385
They were gonna kill you?

28:40.468 --> 28:42.429
STAN: They were an advanced unit
of the armored corps.

28:42.512 --> 28:44.806
They weren't gonna
burden themselves with prisoners.

28:47.142 --> 28:48.059
And the kid...

28:49.310 --> 28:50.437
we appealed to him.

28:52.939 --> 28:55.650
Somebody said one thing they'd like,
as it was obvious

28:55.734 --> 28:58.862
this was the last time we'd ever have it,
was we'd like a drink.

28:59.821 --> 29:02.490
Uh, so the kid went up to the house,
the Germans were staying at the house,

29:02.574 --> 29:03.908
and he brought back a bottle.

29:04.659 --> 29:06.035
We started to drink.

29:06.119 --> 29:07.328
(chuckles)

29:08.121 --> 29:09.539
Got the kid drunk.

29:15.336 --> 29:16.254
Well, you know...

29:21.092 --> 29:24.095
I've told this story
several times, as you do...

29:26.556 --> 29:28.308
And it occurs to me that...

29:31.519 --> 29:33.521
It occurs to me
that every time I would tell it

29:33.605 --> 29:36.232
I would say that we got the kid drunk
and we slipped out.

29:39.027 --> 29:39.944
The truth...

29:44.657 --> 29:46.493
Truth was, of course, we killed him.

29:47.994 --> 29:49.662
(sighs)

29:50.330 --> 29:53.416
Somebody's gonna have to die. Them or you.

29:53.500 --> 29:54.834
Yes, that's true.

29:57.128 --> 29:58.129
We knew it was true.

29:58.505 --> 30:00.006
You ever sorry you killed him?

30:00.548 --> 30:02.300
I'm sorry every day I live.

30:06.387 --> 30:08.765
But I wasn't gonna let that man kill me.

30:12.018 --> 30:12.936
Well...

30:14.687 --> 30:16.815
Gentlemen, we're going
hunting in the morning.

30:17.607 --> 30:19.692
I think we should get some rest.

30:22.278 --> 30:23.655
-I don't--
-Just drive.

30:24.405 --> 30:25.949
Just keep on driving.

30:28.159 --> 30:29.661
What is all that junk back there?

30:32.372 --> 30:33.873
I asked you a question.

30:34.916 --> 30:36.584
-I'm going hunting.
-Hunting.

30:38.545 --> 30:41.297
-It's hunting equipment.
-That is very interesting.

30:48.054 --> 30:50.056
What is that? What is-- what is that?

30:50.139 --> 30:51.933
What the hell? What the hell is that?

30:52.016 --> 30:54.018
-A gun? Why?
-Uh...

30:55.395 --> 30:57.313
-I'm a police officer.
-(scoffs)

30:58.398 --> 30:59.649
I pick a cop?

31:00.441 --> 31:02.986
All the stuff that's already
happened to me, oh, man.

31:03.778 --> 31:05.196
Oh, man.

31:07.282 --> 31:08.324
Pull the car over.

31:09.284 --> 31:10.201
-Look--
-(gun cocks)

31:10.285 --> 31:12.954
I said pull over the car.

31:23.506 --> 31:25.925
Get out. I said get out!

31:28.386 --> 31:29.262
Take the keys.

31:37.937 --> 31:38.855
Open the trunk.

31:48.781 --> 31:50.450
I think we ought to talk about this.

31:50.909 --> 31:52.744
I said open the trunk.

31:53.202 --> 31:55.413
And when you open it, then get in.

32:04.923 --> 32:06.007
No, no.

32:14.349 --> 32:15.767
Okay.

32:17.101 --> 32:18.478
You start digging.

32:25.109 --> 32:26.402
Dig a grave.

32:51.219 --> 32:52.595
My uncle was a cop.

32:53.888 --> 32:55.431
My dad was a cop.

32:56.349 --> 32:58.101
My dad was two cops.

32:58.518 --> 33:00.228
I would've guessed he was a cop.

33:00.812 --> 33:04.065
-You would?
-Hey, it runs in the family.

33:04.399 --> 33:05.525
Some kind of genes.

33:06.943 --> 33:08.069
He die in the line?

33:09.445 --> 33:13.074
My uncle? (scoffs)
He died of cirrhosis.

33:13.241 --> 33:15.827
-Big deal.
-Stress of the job.

33:15.910 --> 33:17.370
No, he liked to drink.

33:17.453 --> 33:19.747
He would've been a drunk
if he was a crossing guard.

33:20.289 --> 33:21.916
My dad died in the line.

33:22.458 --> 33:24.919
(sighs) I'm sorry to hear that.

33:26.170 --> 33:27.296
He was a hero.

33:28.214 --> 33:29.674
I have no doubt that he was.

33:30.049 --> 33:31.467
He was a hell of a man.

33:33.136 --> 33:34.804
How old were you when he went down?

33:36.097 --> 33:37.015
Fourteen.

33:37.849 --> 33:38.933
Hell of a thing.

33:39.642 --> 33:41.310
-They get the guy that shot him?
-No.

33:41.394 --> 33:45.273
No, no, of course not, no.
And there you have it, huh?

33:45.356 --> 33:48.359
You know what I say?
You know what life is?

33:48.443 --> 33:50.028
-No.
-Life...

33:51.988 --> 33:55.033
is when you're alive.

33:55.908 --> 33:58.327
(laughing)

33:58.411 --> 34:01.039
Hey, I'm a caveman. I don't care.

34:01.414 --> 34:05.585
Some swell sits in an office all day long.
Well, fine.

34:05.668 --> 34:07.378
-Fine for him.
-That's what I'm saying.

34:07.462 --> 34:10.631
-Not for me.
-No, and that is your absolute right.

34:11.382 --> 34:13.843
-But... but--
-Hey, leave it behind you.

34:13.926 --> 34:15.845
-But if you've done something--
-Leave it.

34:15.928 --> 34:17.764
Katie, Katie, look, look.

34:18.431 --> 34:21.225
There comes a time when a man--

34:21.642 --> 34:23.644
If he is a man, you see what I'm saying?

34:24.228 --> 34:28.024
He must decide for himself
the way that things are.

34:28.107 --> 34:31.527
-You follow? Do you follow me, huh?
-Yes.

34:31.861 --> 34:34.697
Now, you shot that dude last night.

34:35.073 --> 34:38.201
He threw down,
and you beat him to the punch.

34:38.284 --> 34:40.912
An armed robber and he is dead.

34:42.246 --> 34:46.042
Now, everyone else in this world is gonna
suggest that you went and you did wrong.

34:46.125 --> 34:48.920
You somehow misused some right.

34:49.462 --> 34:53.049
But you don't got the right
to shoot someone.

34:53.132 --> 34:55.093
-I don't--
-Nobody does.

34:55.176 --> 34:57.595
What you did last night,
that wasn't your right.

34:57.678 --> 34:59.597
That was your-your duty.

35:00.014 --> 35:01.015
Hey...

35:02.642 --> 35:04.393
(chuckles) Hey. Hey, now.

35:04.685 --> 35:06.479
That is a strange idea.

35:06.562 --> 35:09.398
-Yeah.
-Try that on for size, huh.

35:11.275 --> 35:12.735
I'll tell you what else.

35:14.070 --> 35:16.364
I say that you...

35:17.281 --> 35:18.741
you are okay.

35:19.450 --> 35:20.368
Okay?

35:21.452 --> 35:24.080
They took your piece.
You want a hide-out gun?

35:24.413 --> 35:25.498
I'll give it to you.

35:25.915 --> 35:28.960
Uh, you wanna borrow 100 bucks,
you just ask. It's yours.

35:29.043 --> 35:33.089
You want someone
to keep a secret for you, Norm Buntz.

35:33.339 --> 35:35.967
Hey, we've all been there together, pal.

35:37.218 --> 35:39.428
I think I want one more drink.

35:40.721 --> 35:42.515
Who rides, decides.

35:43.099 --> 35:45.560
-Bartender.
-BARTENDER: Right away.

35:46.769 --> 35:49.355
So, uh, tell me about your dad.

35:52.108 --> 35:53.860
Ah, give me some of that.

36:01.409 --> 36:04.036
Okay, stand in the wood smoke.

36:04.120 --> 36:06.622
It'll hide any city scents
that you have on you.

36:08.583 --> 36:10.376
The deer don't mind the smoke.

36:11.502 --> 36:14.088
They'll run 15 miles
from the scent of aftershave.

36:14.172 --> 36:17.008
Well, some of us more sartorial types
have that problem.

36:17.675 --> 36:20.678
-(Bobby coughing)
-Okay, that's enough.

36:21.888 --> 36:23.848
(sighs) What a beautiful morning.

36:24.223 --> 36:27.268
-Mm, you said it.
-I wish Henry was here.

36:28.603 --> 36:29.437
STAN: Okay.

36:31.022 --> 36:34.066
Let's move out. No talking in the woods.

36:34.150 --> 36:35.401
-(gun cocks)
-You got it.

36:58.507 --> 36:59.342
All right.

37:02.345 --> 37:04.931
And... and...

37:07.225 --> 37:08.226
that's it?

37:09.393 --> 37:10.561
Now you're gonna kill me?

37:10.645 --> 37:12.355
Well, man, you know
that I have to kill you.

37:12.438 --> 37:15.316
-You have to kill me?
-Kidnapped a cop, man.

37:15.399 --> 37:18.527
What about if you didn't?
If you didn't kidnap a cop?

37:20.196 --> 37:22.698
-They-- I know who you are.
-You know who I am?

37:22.782 --> 37:24.825
They want you for those currency exchange.

37:24.909 --> 37:25.743
What do you know about me?

37:25.826 --> 37:26.994
-Description.
-Description?

37:27.078 --> 37:28.871
-We don't have your name.
-What are you telling me?

37:28.955 --> 37:31.707
I'm telling you no one has anything.

37:31.791 --> 37:32.833
We have an MO.

37:35.127 --> 37:36.170
You lay off...

37:37.588 --> 37:39.507
you move off, and I'm gonna let this go.

37:41.968 --> 37:44.387
-You're gonna let what go?
-I'm supposed to be hunting.

37:44.845 --> 37:46.138
No one knows where I am.

37:46.764 --> 37:49.517
Nobody knows.
Nobody saw me get in that car.

37:50.434 --> 37:51.811
No one knows where I am.

37:53.354 --> 37:56.148
If I go back tomorrow,
I can go back, and this never happened.

37:56.649 --> 37:58.317
You take the car. Take the--

37:58.943 --> 38:01.320
It has guns in it. Food. Take it.

38:02.446 --> 38:03.656
I stopped by the road.

38:04.282 --> 38:06.158
I'll say I stopped, and you'll have hours.

38:08.286 --> 38:09.453
Someone stole my car.

38:12.331 --> 38:13.249
You hear what I'm saying?

38:13.332 --> 38:15.459
-I kidnapped you, man.
-No kidnapping, no.

38:15.543 --> 38:16.627
No, I never saw you.

38:17.545 --> 38:19.422
Look, what's in it for you?

38:19.505 --> 38:22.633
No kidnapping,
no federal, no capital offense.

38:22.717 --> 38:24.593
You know if you do this...

38:26.262 --> 38:27.596
you know they'll find you.

38:29.432 --> 38:30.391
I'm saying...

38:31.767 --> 38:32.852
go free.

38:33.894 --> 38:36.522
Whatever it is you want,
what you want to do, you do it.

38:37.273 --> 38:38.107
I'm saying...

38:38.816 --> 38:39.650
I'm just saying...

38:41.027 --> 38:41.944
leave me here.

38:44.488 --> 38:45.531
I'm begging you.

38:51.829 --> 38:55.416
Whatever you want to do, you do it,
but I'm saying...

38:56.792 --> 38:57.710
this...

38:59.295 --> 39:00.129
this...

39:02.048 --> 39:04.008
this is the right thing for us both.

39:04.091 --> 39:06.427
You know that I can't believe you, man.

39:09.764 --> 39:11.057
Now, you don't--
you don't want to kill me.

39:12.641 --> 39:13.517
You don't want to,

39:14.810 --> 39:17.563
because you'd be killing us both.

39:18.814 --> 39:19.899
Think about you.

39:21.650 --> 39:22.818
I never saw you.

39:23.527 --> 39:26.572
I never saw you. I never saw you.

39:44.048 --> 39:45.383
(whispers) Oh, yeah.

39:58.062 --> 40:00.731
-(thuds)
-(screaming)

40:00.815 --> 40:02.525
-Bobby...
-What is it?!

40:04.151 --> 40:05.277
-Bobby?
-What is it?

40:05.361 --> 40:08.114
(screaming) I stepped on a...
I stepped on a...

40:08.197 --> 40:11.200
I got a damn spike in my foot!

40:13.953 --> 40:16.622
(crying)

41:03.461 --> 41:04.420
BOBBY: Ow!

41:04.837 --> 41:07.131
Hell of an ending
for a weekend in the country.

41:07.214 --> 41:08.466
These things happen, my man.

41:08.549 --> 41:10.509
Oh, I should've looked where I was going.

41:10.593 --> 41:13.387
Can't look where you're going
and look at the deer at the same time.

41:13.471 --> 41:15.973
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah. Oh, man.

41:16.056 --> 41:17.933
I'm gonna get tetanus, get a shot,

41:18.017 --> 41:20.060
walk with my foot in a cast
for the whole time.

41:20.144 --> 41:22.605
It's just as easy to set the style
as it is to follow them.

41:22.688 --> 41:23.981
Come on,
I'm gonna get you to the hospital.

41:24.064 --> 41:25.065
No!

41:25.608 --> 41:26.817
I'm fine. I'm fine!

41:26.901 --> 41:28.569
Don't go making a spectacle out of me.

41:28.652 --> 41:29.653
Let's...

41:30.154 --> 41:32.490
let's get the place straightened out
and then we'll head back to town.

41:32.573 --> 41:34.408
You know, I'm gonna save
this spike, Bobby Hill.

41:34.492 --> 41:37.203
Get it mounted on a big plush,
wall plaque,

41:37.286 --> 41:40.873
hang it in united pine den
as a memento of our hunting trip.

41:40.956 --> 41:43.042
Wasn't that buck something?

41:43.125 --> 41:45.836
Oh, had to go six points, 190 pounds.

41:45.920 --> 41:48.214
Hundred and ninety? Are you guys nuts?

41:48.297 --> 41:50.674
That there was a ten-point buck.

41:50.758 --> 41:52.551
Over 205, 210 pounds.

41:52.635 --> 41:56.222
I got the glass on him.
He... he blotted out the whole sky.

41:56.305 --> 41:59.517
And he's still there, babe.
He's still there.

42:00.100 --> 42:01.727
Next week, we--

42:01.810 --> 42:04.980
When are we gonna all get
free time together again?

42:06.148 --> 42:08.400
Then we will bury him in our memory.

42:14.865 --> 42:16.784
Oh, man, oh, man.

42:16.867 --> 42:20.204
I've never been so sick
in my whole entire life.

42:20.287 --> 42:22.998
-Well, that's good.
-Why is that good?

42:23.666 --> 42:25.709
'Cause if it's inside you,
it's gotta come out.

42:26.752 --> 42:29.338
-Can you make it up the stairs?
-Yeah.

42:30.256 --> 42:31.465
Oh, yeah, we, uh,

42:31.549 --> 42:33.551
we solved those problems
last night, didn't we?

42:33.634 --> 42:35.636
(laughs) I don't know.

42:35.719 --> 42:37.012
I don't remember.

42:38.389 --> 42:40.849
Oh, what am I gonna do today?

42:41.183 --> 42:44.478
-I have to go sign in.
-Eh, call in. Take a personal day.

42:44.562 --> 42:46.438
Stay home and look out the window.

43:05.541 --> 43:07.209
-Buntz...
-Yeah?

43:07.293 --> 43:08.794
My friends call me Norm.

43:09.295 --> 43:11.088
-Norm.
-Yeah.

43:11.463 --> 43:14.341
-You really turned me around a bit.
-Yeah, I know.

43:14.758 --> 43:15.801
I'm glad to do it.

43:16.719 --> 43:18.679
-Thank you.
-Hey, thank you.

43:19.388 --> 43:20.514
Glad for the company.

43:20.598 --> 43:22.266
Why did you reach out to me?

43:22.725 --> 43:23.892
Two reasons.

43:23.976 --> 43:26.186
One, I need a woman for an undercover bit.

43:26.770 --> 43:27.771
What's the other one?

43:28.939 --> 43:29.940
Well...

43:30.858 --> 43:32.943
everybody likes to be next to a hero.

43:46.040 --> 43:48.125
(chatter)

43:56.175 --> 43:58.427
Lieutenant Goldblume,
we didn't expect you till, um--

43:58.510 --> 44:00.012
Well, you know, I, uh...

44:01.513 --> 44:03.390
I'd like the form
for carrying a backup gun.

44:03.474 --> 44:04.975
-Could you please...
-Yes, sir.

44:05.059 --> 44:06.685
LUCY: Surprised to see you so soon.

44:07.645 --> 44:10.230
Everything went well
with your secret society of hunters?

44:10.314 --> 44:13.275
-Yeah, my car was stolen. I never got--
-Your car was stolen?

44:13.817 --> 44:16.528
-Back early, Lieutenant. Any luck?
-Not too much.

44:22.701 --> 44:24.536
(chatter)

44:25.746 --> 44:27.790
Form, backup revolver, carrying out.

44:28.832 --> 44:29.875
Thank you.

44:30.250 --> 44:32.419
Sir, you're gonna have to schedule
some time at the range--

44:32.503 --> 44:34.797
Yes, yes, let's do that right now.

44:34.880 --> 44:36.882
-I can, uh--
-Do that right away.

44:37.466 --> 44:38.884
Tell 'em I can come right down.

44:43.305 --> 44:44.682
-Morning, guys.
-BOTH: Morning.

44:45.683 --> 44:48.102
Hey, you get 'em already, Lieutenant?

44:48.185 --> 44:51.271
Am I gonna go out that door
and see 100 12-point bucks

44:51.355 --> 44:52.940
strapped to the fenders of your car?

44:53.023 --> 44:55.109
-He's free to come down--
-I'm free right now.

44:55.192 --> 44:56.026
I'll come down right now.

44:56.110 --> 44:57.820
MAN: He said he was probably
still in the area.

44:57.903 --> 44:59.905
They said he was probably
in the area the whole time.

44:59.988 --> 45:01.615
You could've seen him on the street.

45:01.699 --> 45:03.200
Could've even gotten a look at him.

45:03.283 --> 45:04.451
I didn't see anyone on the street.

45:04.535 --> 45:05.786
They said come down and look at mug books.

45:05.869 --> 45:08.288
I said, "Yes, it's gonna help you catch
the guy, you bet I will.

45:08.372 --> 45:09.707
Before he kills someone!"

45:09.790 --> 45:12.418
-This way, sir.
-Man, you ask me,

45:12.501 --> 45:15.796
though you didn't ask me,
I think that you should've stayed to help.

45:17.172 --> 45:20.092
Lieutenant, 1:30 this afternoon
range qualifying session.

45:20.175 --> 45:23.721
Thank you. Could someone get me a form,
please, for a stolen car?

45:35.816 --> 45:36.734
FRANK: Henry?

45:37.735 --> 45:41.155
-You're back early.
-I, uh, well, you know.

45:42.364 --> 45:44.450
I wanna thank you for giving the speech.

45:44.533 --> 45:47.119
-Mm-hmm.
-I think it took a little bit of courage

45:47.202 --> 45:49.204
to talk to those kids
about some serious stuff.

45:52.666 --> 45:54.710
-Are you all right?
-Was up all night.

45:56.253 --> 45:57.588
Well, thank you.

45:58.964 --> 46:00.132
LUCY: Manly nonsense.

46:01.258 --> 46:02.926
And there's enough violence in the world.

46:03.010 --> 46:05.053
It's only nonsense if it's not your thing.

46:05.137 --> 46:07.097
And what's this name-calling?

46:07.181 --> 46:09.683
LUCY: Oh, not to the deer.
Not if the deer is killed.

46:09.767 --> 46:12.311
Then it's not name-calling, is it?
No, uh-uh.

46:12.728 --> 46:15.147
(indistinct chattering)

46:17.858 --> 46:20.152
(telephone rings)

46:20.235 --> 46:24.281
-WOMAN: Hill Street Station.
-(chatter continues)

46:35.626 --> 46:38.086
-(knocks on door)
-Come in.

46:43.926 --> 46:45.511
I was kidnapped last night.

46:47.888 --> 46:51.683
-(Bobby groaning)
-Okay.

46:51.767 --> 46:52.935
Grab hold of the door.

46:55.395 --> 46:56.313
(groans)

47:01.985 --> 47:04.822
Give one last sweep of the area
then head home.

47:05.572 --> 47:07.115
Didn't even fire a shot.

47:07.574 --> 47:09.993
Well, sometimes that's the way it is.

47:10.953 --> 47:12.621
Leave it better than you found it.

47:35.894 --> 47:38.230
-(car doors close)
-(engine starts)

47:42.359 --> 47:45.362
(closing theme playing)
