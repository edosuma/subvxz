<b>1x01 - The Avengers Protocol /part 1/</b>

00:02.131 --> 00:05.167
<i>Iron Man: It's noon,
got three hours of beauty rest.</i>

00:05.169 --> 00:07.302
<i>Man, it's been awhile
since I've seen any action.</i>

00:07.304 --> 00:10.672
<i>I wonder if any of the old gang
needs their butts saved today.</i>

00:12.308 --> 00:14.476
<i>So Thor's bringing the thunder as usual.</i>

00:14.478 --> 00:16.712
<i>But what are his odds doing it solo?</i>

00:16.714 --> 00:21.116
<i>I'll bet 62% chance of...
Scratch that. [roars]</i>

00:21.118 --> 00:24.620
<i>Hulk. Nah, he's sitting
at 96% smash probability.</i>

00:24.622 --> 00:26.088
[grunts]

00:26.090 --> 00:28.357
Hawkeye definitely needs my help.

00:30.360 --> 00:33.295
<i>Jarvis:  Have you noticed how often
you lose your bets with yourself?</i>

00:33.297 --> 00:37.232
<i>If I were keeping track, 
I believe you'd owe yourself $15 million.</i>

00:37.234 --> 00:40.369
Don't worry, Jarvis.
I'm good for every digital penny.

00:40.371 --> 00:43.172
<i>Jarvis:  You could
just contact them, sir.</i>

00:43.174 --> 00:45.541
No, we broke up the band for a reason.

00:45.543 --> 00:49.645
And like I predicted, Earth is
doing just fine without the Avengers.

00:49.647 --> 00:52.781
It's just that...
[alarm blares]

00:52.783 --> 00:54.516
That can't be right.

00:54.518 --> 00:56.185
Captain America can handle
a bunch of HYDRA losers

00:56.187 --> 00:58.487
with one arm and a rolled-up newspaper.

00:58.489 --> 01:01.845
Red Skull?
He is long dead.

01:01.880 --> 01:05.294
<i>Jarvis:  Satellites confirm
a match of body telemetry.</i>

01:05.296 --> 01:07.162
<i>It is him, sir.</i>

01:07.164 --> 01:10.666
Upload those coordinates into my
navigation and keep my eggs warm.

01:10.668 --> 01:13.135
Skull busting makes me hungry.

01:13.436 --> 01:14.636
[whirs]

01:16.840 --> 01:19.174
New toys, same old HYDRA.

01:19.176 --> 01:20.442
Sorry you came all the
way back from the dead

01:20.444 --> 01:22.144
to chalk up another loss, Skull.

01:22.512 --> 01:26.148
Perhaps.
Perhaps not. [guns cocking]

01:26.150 --> 01:27.416
[cackles]

01:27.418 --> 01:29.551
Just a few more seconds, Cap.
I got your back.

01:32.555 --> 01:34.790

01:36.426 --> 01:37.426

No!

01:59.282 --> 02:00.582
[coughs]

02:00.584 --> 02:03.285
So the Iron Man has a heart after all?

02:04.487 --> 02:06.755
Drop the shield, you animal!

02:06.757 --> 02:08.457
I think not.

02:08.459 --> 02:14.329
Consider it a symbol of a new dawn,
and your demise.

02:16.332 --> 02:19.501
Jarvis, give me a
pre-play simulation now!

02:19.503 --> 02:21.336
<i>Jarvis: Pre-play simulation.
[beeping]</i>

02:25.508 --> 02:28.377
Scans show their tech is hard-wired
to their central nervous systems.

02:28.379 --> 02:29.878
HYDRA's never been that advanced.

02:29.880 --> 02:31.413
What happened to my
pre-play sims, Jarvis?

02:31.415 --> 02:35.250
<i>Jarvis:  Already ahead of you, sir.
As usual.</i>

02:37.620 --> 02:39.488
Those guys are gonna
wake up with a headache.

02:39.490 --> 02:41.796
<i>Jarvis:  Armor breached.
System failure.</i>

<i>Red Skull: You are just
a fool in a machine, Stark!</i>

02:48.232 --> 02:50.866
Without your technology,
you have nothing!

02:50.868 --> 02:54.903
No instinct for battle.
No fire to lead!

02:54.905 --> 03:00.509
You hide behind armor so you don't
have to make sacrifices for victory!

03:00.511 --> 03:01.977
<i>[beeping]
Jarvis: Power is at 20%, sir.</i>

03:01.979 --> 03:05.380
<i>And you have a new
problem teleporting in.</i>

03:05.382 --> 03:06.815
Red Skull: Let me show you!

03:07.650 --> 03:09.851
Won't this be fun.

03:09.853 --> 03:12.421
M.O.D.O.K.?
Since when does he team up?

03:12.423 --> 03:13.655
[strains]

03:13.657 --> 03:17.969
<i>Red Skull: M.O.D.O.K. has
graciously upgraded my army.</i>

03:18.461 --> 03:19.895
As you're well aware,

03:19.897 --> 03:22.831
his technopathic abilities
work wonders with machines.

03:22.833 --> 03:25.934
<i>Even your machines, Herr Stark.</i>

03:25.936 --> 03:30.772
Enjoy your final
painful moments on Earth.

[Red Skull coughs]

03:36.480 --> 03:38.747
We got what we came for, Skull.

03:45.622 --> 03:51.460
Cap.
Jarvis, activate "the Avengers protocol."

03:51.462 --> 03:54.976
[police siren wails]
Cops are coming, uh, so hang around.

03:55.632 --> 03:57.432
[computer whirs]

03:57.434 --> 03:58.634
[gasps]

03:58.636 --> 04:01.932
I'm already warmed up
and I got the B.O. to prove it.

04:02.806 --> 04:07.943
<i>Don't waste you arrow. It's time.
I've activated the Avengers protocol.</i>

04:07.945 --> 04:10.646
Yeah, right.
Hilarious, Stark.

04:10.648 --> 04:12.314
All right, where are the hidden cameras?

04:12.316 --> 04:17.954
<i>Code Alpha, Omicron, Omega.
We need you, Hawkeye.</i>

04:18.454 --> 04:22.324
<i>Iron Man: We had our reasons
for disbanding the Avengers. I bet some would</i>

04:22.326 --> 04:27.362
<i>count my winning personality as one of them. 
And the world did fine without us,</i>

04:27.998 --> 04:31.933
<i>some things changed.
You know my ego well enough to realize</i>

04:31.935 --> 04:35.437
<i>I wouldn't send out this call
if I could just whip up a suit of armor</i>

04:35.439 --> 04:37.739
<i>and make the bad things go away.</i>

04:37.741 --> 04:39.041
Puny Stark!

04:39.043 --> 04:42.711
<i> Whatever you're doing,
I guarantee it's nothing compared to this.</i>

04:42.713 --> 04:45.847
<i>Get to the mansion A.S.A.P.
Your team is waiting.</i>

04:45.849 --> 04:48.784
Agent Wilson, I was told you
were at the top of your class!

04:48.786 --> 04:53.021
<i>So why am I watching you just hang out
here like Spider-Man after a late night?</i>

04:53.023 --> 04:55.457
<i>Wilson, what's gotten into you?</i>

04:55.459 --> 04:57.759
Sorry, Director Fury, just
got a call for the big leagues.

04:57.761 --> 05:01.563
"Big leagues"? Ha! And what do you
think is bigger than S.H.I.E.L.D.?

05:02.499 --> 05:07.402
<i>Jarvis, I'm here. And I'm completely
geeking out that Tony sent a probe for me.</i>

05:07.404 --> 05:10.439
<i>Jarvis:  Mr. Stark suggested you
should wear the War Machine armor.</i>

05:10.441 --> 05:13.375
War Machine?
I don't think so.

05:13.377 --> 05:15.848
Time to give project
Redwing its first test drive.

05:19.082 --> 05:22.617
<i>Jarvis:  Arrogant and pig-headed,
you'll make a fine Avenger.</i>

05:22.619 --> 05:23.018
[engines roar]

05:27.790 --> 05:31.059
Called you too, huh?
Nothing big going on in Valhalla tonight?

05:31.661 --> 05:33.795
Yugensborg!

05:33.797 --> 05:35.997
The norse tree-hurling
competition and a festival

05:35.999 --> 05:38.667
the likes of which
you can't even imagine.

05:38.669 --> 05:41.937
But never have I heard Stark so serious.

Cross your fingers! [strains]

05:54.517 --> 05:55.817
[sighs]

05:55.819 --> 05:59.154
- Now, you go hit whatever hit us.
- That suits me fine!

06:00.089 --> 06:02.824
[air whooshing]
Hulk, you fool!

06:02.826 --> 06:04.760
[grunts]
You'll kill us all!

06:07.096 --> 06:09.631
Did you just call me stupid?

06:09.633 --> 06:10.999
[both grunt]

06:17.507 --> 06:18.907
Some things never change.

06:23.713 --> 06:26.581
[grunts]
[groans]

06:26.583 --> 06:29.017
Now, this is a battle.
It's been too long.

06:29.019 --> 06:32.554
Too long. Like your hair.

06:34.090 --> 06:34.756
[roars]

06:34.758 --> 06:36.925
[both grunt]

06:36.927 --> 06:38.093
<i>Enough!</i>

06:39.061 --> 06:42.931
You knuckleheads play tag
and Manhattan gets a 9.0 earthquake.

06:42.933 --> 06:46.468
Thanks for reminding me why
this didn't work last time.

06:46.470 --> 06:49.037
Iron Man: Here's what's happening.
The Avengers are reassembling.

06:49.039 --> 06:51.573
Handpicked by me, under my command.

06:52.008 --> 06:56.144
Ha! You? You could lead a field
trip to Vegas, maybe, but...

06:56.146 --> 06:59.815
No jokes. Not now.
Cap is gone.

07:07.490 --> 07:10.959
One of our own fell today,
taken down by M.O.D.O.K.,

07:10.961 --> 07:15.096
<i>and the Red Skull. If they're
together now, the world is at risk.</i>

07:15.098 --> 07:18.867
Besides, we have a friend to avenge.

07:18.869 --> 07:21.736
Now, I know you all have
reasons to walk out that door,

07:21.738 --> 07:23.805
but I can't do this alone.

07:23.807 --> 07:28.743
<i>Can we set the past aside and
work together, one last time?</i>

07:28.745 --> 07:32.113
We are Avengers, and the world needs us.

07:34.083 --> 07:36.051
You know me, point and shoot.

07:36.053 --> 07:39.087
We gonna hug now, or
can we go smash someone?

07:46.262 --> 07:47.929
Keeping my distance for now,

07:47.931 --> 07:50.732
but it looks like the call
I got wasn't a mistake.

07:50.734 --> 07:53.969
The Avengers are having a reunion.
Black Widow out.

07:56.672 --> 07:59.641
I'm sure you never imagined
I would outlive you.

08:00.243 --> 08:02.043
[coughs]

08:02.045 --> 08:07.588
If you're done muttering to yourself,
perhaps you should get to work.

08:07.623 --> 08:10.519
You have been useful, M.O.D.O.K.,
but do not forget your place.

08:10.521 --> 08:11.987
[alarm blares]

08:13.923 --> 08:15.023
So soon?

08:15.025 --> 08:19.961
I knew Stark would be angry.
Good.

08:22.901 --> 08:25.535
<i>I hacked into the
satellite there is, to trace</i>

08:25.536 --> 08:28.169
the tachyon particles
associated with teleportation.

08:28.171 --> 08:30.805
<i>Jarvis:  All data points to Antarctica.</i>

08:30.807 --> 08:34.808
Hulk: Whatever gets us
smashing faster! [clinks]

08:34.811 --> 08:37.812
They're called "mints."
Try a dozen.

08:37.813 --> 08:40.982
- Hawkeye!  - What? 
Can't look for bad guys if I have to cut through

08:40.984 --> 08:44.085
his gamma breath to see them.
Hey!

08:44.720 --> 08:46.021
[yelps]

08:46.023 --> 08:47.789
See anything now?
[Hawkeye screams]

08:48.057 --> 08:50.559
Hulk!

08:50.561 --> 08:52.694
Actually, you just did
me a favor, green bean.

I'm bringing us in close,
brace yourself for...

09:32.769 --> 09:34.736
<i>Jarvis:  System breach.
Mainframe override.</i>

09:34.738 --> 09:39.908
<i>I though you understood
what a technopath does to machines, Stark?</i>

09:39.910 --> 09:42.043
<i>Whatever I want.</i>

09:45.047 --> 09:46.715
<i>Iron Man: Change of plans, guys.</i>

09:46.717 --> 09:48.383
Looks like we're gonna
need someone to avenge us.

09:56.859 --> 09:58.793
<i>Iron Man: Everybody clear? 
Good!</i>

10:01.063 --> 10:02.831
Okay, that's an ouch.

10:02.833 --> 10:04.766
Apparently, M.O.D.O.K.'s
increased his range

10:04.768 --> 10:07.736
as well as his power levels.
That stinks.

10:07.738 --> 10:09.804
[coughs]
You said it.

10:09.806 --> 10:11.072
Forget the breath mints, Hulk.

10:11.074 --> 10:13.408
We're skipping straight
to advanced showering.

10:13.410 --> 10:15.276
I can still drop you.

10:24.987 --> 10:28.189
What is our plan to vanquish the Skull?

10:28.191 --> 10:30.025
Hit everything! Hard!

10:32.028 --> 10:34.963
So the plan is "there is no plan".

10:34.965 --> 10:39.267
- I thought he was the smart one.
- I like the plan.

10:39.269 --> 10:40.835

- Hey, I'm fighting here!

<i>Widow: Typical.</i>

11:19.075 --> 11:22.277
So this is what Stark in
charge looks like? Oh, boy.

11:30.486 --> 11:32.353

11:32.355 --> 11:34.219
Want to rethink the
non-plan, shellhead?

Trust me. Just shoot your little
arrows and let me handle it.

11:36.927 --> 11:38.293
We have to find the Skull before...

11:41.731 --> 11:44.365
One dead Avenger isn't enough?

There is nothing you can build that
I can't manipulate, Stark! I will...

[beeping]

11:51.774 --> 11:53.007
[groans]

11:54.176 --> 11:56.111
Tell me that was someone
being fashionably late.

11:56.113 --> 11:59.414
It was. I just wanted to
make sure you needed me

11:59.416 --> 12:01.750
before I accepted your invite.

12:01.752 --> 12:04.472
And of course, you do.
No surprise.

<i>Red Skull: [on speaker]
M.O.D.O.K., the time is now. Or all is lost.</i>

As you wish.

12:09.292 --> 12:11.426

12:14.997 --> 12:18.500
Is it true?
About Cap?

12:21.004 --> 12:24.172
- Yes. - Then you'd better stop
playing solo and actually lead this team

12:24.174 --> 12:27.776
before you lose more friends today.

12:27.778 --> 12:31.312
All right, as a team.
M.O.D.O.K.'s cloaked.

12:31.314 --> 12:34.015
I can't find a hair on
his big ugly head. Ideas?

12:34.017 --> 12:37.051
Scan for the Skull.
He's a Super-soldier alumni.

12:37.053 --> 12:40.355
His blood has trace isotopes
that will show up on a chemical scan.

12:40.357 --> 12:44.292
- I'm impressed.
- Of course you are. [grunts]

12:44.294 --> 12:48.229
Accessing the Super-soldier files,
scanning for a chemical match.

12:48.231 --> 12:50.000
And there's two targets?

12:54.570 --> 12:56.982
We had a plan...
 for a few seconds.

13:00.342 --> 13:01.309
Uh-oh.

13:02.912 --> 13:04.279
[all grunting]

13:07.283 --> 13:09.884
Next time you want to
complain about my breath,

13:09.886 --> 13:12.086
remember I just saved your...
[groans]

13:12.088 --> 13:14.033
Sorry, I didn't get that last part.

13:15.958 --> 13:20.195
<i>Automated defenses have us pinned down.
We need some tech help, now!</i>

13:20.197 --> 13:22.964
Iron Man: Rub your brains
together and come up with a plan.

13:22.966 --> 13:24.465
I'm too close.

13:25.401 --> 13:26.401
[repulsor powering up]

13:28.504 --> 13:30.471
No!

13:33.342 --> 13:35.310
Knock, knock, M.O.D.O.K.

13:35.312 --> 13:37.445
Cap, you're alive!
[both straining]

13:40.616 --> 13:43.918
I don't know what Skull's doing to
you, but let's get you out of here.

13:43.920 --> 13:45.118
Iron Man?

13:46.188 --> 13:49.924
You weren't fried, you were teleported.

13:49.926 --> 13:53.161
I can't believe I missed that.
I'm glad to see you, buddy.

13:53.163 --> 13:56.231
This leadership thing is
way harder than I thought.

13:56.233 --> 13:58.066
Welcome back.

13:58.068 --> 14:01.970
So you left the rest of
your team behind... for me?

14:01.972 --> 14:03.905
It sounds bad when you say it like that.

14:03.907 --> 14:06.407
But...
 how did you know they were here?

14:06.409 --> 14:07.909
Fool! [clanks]

14:09.345 --> 14:15.116
As I said, you have no idea what
it takes to be a leader of men.

14:15.118 --> 14:17.285
This body is mine!

14:20.122 --> 14:23.302
[grunts]
You scum!

14:23.337 --> 14:27.161
<i>Not much of a futurist if you
didn't see this coming, Herr Stark.</i>

14:27.163 --> 14:30.665
I was dying. [grunts]
My body ravaged by the very serum

14:30.667 --> 14:34.035
that had given me such
strength all these years.

14:34.037 --> 14:35.570
[whirs]
[groans]

14:37.039 --> 14:39.674
But why perish when
there was an alternative?

14:39.676 --> 14:42.911
M.O.D.O.K. was the key.
[strains]

14:42.913 --> 14:46.114
His power transferred
my being into a body

14:46.116 --> 14:50.118
where the Super-soldier serum
actually worked. [grunts]

14:50.120 --> 14:50.618
[strains]
[clanks]

14:50.620 --> 14:57.025
We left my hated enemy
to rot in my own walking corpse.

14:57.027 --> 15:00.194
I am the end of the Avengers!

15:00.196 --> 15:03.197
<i>- Cap: This is gonna hurt me
more than it hurts you. - Huh?</i>

15:03.499 --> 15:05.300
[grunts]

15:07.269 --> 15:09.671
Cap, I hope that's you.

15:10.639 --> 15:13.441
<i>Red Skull:  Auf wiedersehen.

15:16.645 --> 15:18.613
You've avenged me, Tony.

15:18.615 --> 15:19.981
[coughs]

15:19.983 --> 15:21.516
Now, lead them.

15:23.385 --> 15:25.219
Jarvis, has Sam left the tower?

15:25.221 --> 15:27.445
<i>Jarvis: Yes, he's on his way, but...</i>

15:27.528 --> 15:29.958
Perfect.
Then it's nap time for big brain.

15:29.960 --> 15:33.127
You said before I didn't
understand sacrifice.

15:33.129 --> 15:36.230
Let's see if I've
learned anything. [whirs]

15:36.232 --> 15:38.499
No! Don't let him!

15:42.604 --> 15:44.005
[screams]

15:44.373 --> 15:46.240
[powering down]

15:46.242 --> 15:47.675
<i>Iron Man: Electromagnetic pulse</i>

15:47.677 --> 15:50.678
shut down all the
working tech in this base.

15:50.680 --> 15:53.648
Meaning your technopath can't do squat.

15:55.050 --> 15:56.451
[clangs]

15:56.453 --> 15:58.753
In your borrowed face.

15:58.755 --> 16:00.188
[laughs]

16:00.190 --> 16:03.191
Your armor is nothing
but dead weight now.

16:03.193 --> 16:07.028
You did nothing but
ensure your own demise!

16:08.464 --> 16:11.632
I know you're the smart one,
but that was pretty dumb.

16:12.201 --> 16:13.368
Wait for it.

16:15.371 --> 16:16.070
[all yell]

16:20.476 --> 16:22.610
<i>Wilson: Iron Man, I'm here.</i>

16:22.612 --> 16:24.345
And the suit is awesome!

16:24.347 --> 16:26.347
<i>Iron Man:  Hit Captain America, hard!</i>

16:26.349 --> 16:28.282
Wilson: What? [strains]

16:28.284 --> 16:29.517
<i>Nein!</i>

16:30.019 --> 16:31.386
[grunts]

16:36.325 --> 16:38.259
Please tell me there was
a good reason for that

16:38.261 --> 16:40.028
because I have always wanted to meet Cap

16:40.030 --> 16:42.096
and knocking a guy out is
not a way to meet your hero.

16:42.098 --> 16:44.732
Brain switch.
And I thought I was your hero.

16:44.734 --> 16:47.035
What happened 
to the War Machine armor?

16:47.037 --> 16:49.270
Wilson: The Falcon armor is just cooler.

16:49.272 --> 16:51.506
"Falcon," huh? Works for me.

16:52.341 --> 16:53.708
[roars]

16:58.514 --> 17:00.381
[growls]
Cap?

17:00.383 --> 17:03.718
- Not Cap, trust me.
- Who's the bird man?

17:03.720 --> 17:07.722
Widow: His name is Sam Wilson.
S.H.I.E.L.D. trainee.

17:07.723 --> 17:10.758
Been moonlighting for
Tony in secret for months.

17:12.060 --> 17:13.594
It's what I do. By the way...

17:13.596 --> 17:16.143
<i>You're fired, Wilson!</i>

17:17.465 --> 17:20.268
- Welcome to the Avengers.
- Uh, thanks?

17:21.837 --> 17:23.771
<i>Jarvis:  Power restored.
[guns cocking]</i>

17:23.772 --> 17:26.406
Ah, that's the stuff.
[whirs]

17:26.409 --> 17:30.078
Systems are finally back online.
That means...

17:30.080 --> 17:31.746
<i>Avengers, assemble!</i>

17:31.747 --> 17:33.747
[music]

17:40.222 --> 17:42.223
<i>Iron Man: You wanted a plan?
Here it is.</i>

17:42.225 --> 17:45.093
<i>Hulk, Thor, keep M.O.D.O.K. off balance.</i>

17:45.095 --> 17:47.428
<i>He can't concentrate,
he can't take me out.</i>

17:47.430 --> 17:51.099
<i>Widow, Hawkeye, get Cap into
the brain switch-a-roo thing.</i>

17:51.101 --> 17:54.635
<i>Falcon, make the thing work.
The Skull is mine.</i>

17:54.637 --> 17:56.771
<i>Is that an acceptable plan, Mr. Hawkeye?</i>

17:56.773 --> 17:59.373
I'll let you know when it works.

I will have vengeance, Stark!
I was built to destroy!

18:28.738 --> 18:31.706
- Together, then?
- Why not?

18:32.774 --> 18:34.408
Move.

18:34.410 --> 18:36.177

18:36.179 --> 18:37.712
[M.O.D.O.K. screams]

I guess you'll be sitting this one out?

18:44.220 --> 18:46.354

We good?

18:46.356 --> 18:47.855
Great.
[both grunt]

18:47.857 --> 18:50.358
Pathetic! This ends now!

18:53.529 --> 18:58.323
I think you're right.
You've scratched up my body enough.

18:58.433 --> 18:59.233
[both grunt]

19:03.572 --> 19:05.573
Brain swapper's online,
but not for long.

19:05.575 --> 19:07.208
Took a lot of damage when you pulsed it.

19:07.210 --> 19:09.443
Consider it on the job
training and make it happen.

19:09.445 --> 19:11.379

19:11.381 --> 19:13.514
You'll regret this, Stark!

Much better, thank you.

19:43.214 --> 19:45.943
All of you.

No one messes with one of
our own and gets away with it.

- Uh, don't dislocate your shoulder

back, fearless leader.
