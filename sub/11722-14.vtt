00:00.987 --> 00:02.789
Previously on
"The Secret Circle"...

00:02.790 --> 00:05.458
You're a witch.
You're a full-blooded 100% witch.

00:06.190 --> 00:07.624
A complete circle
is six.

00:07.626 --> 00:09.059
You complete
the circle.

00:09.061 --> 00:10.561
You're back.
Had to make sure

00:10.563 --> 00:12.529
Adam and Cassie don't
get to second base, huh?

00:12.531 --> 00:14.865
I believed Isaac
when he said the witches

00:14.985 --> 00:16.768
were the ones who started
the fire that night.

00:16.770 --> 00:19.070
But our parents
were murdered.

00:19.072 --> 00:20.605
It was definitely
the witch hunters.

00:20.607 --> 00:23.325
I found this,
my father's medallion.

00:23.327 --> 00:25.643
I saw him use it
against the witch hunters.

00:25.645 --> 00:28.496
This medallion is the best way
I know how to protect us.

00:28.498 --> 00:31.533
There must be a spell that can
activate its energy.

00:34.937 --> 00:37.505
Daddy.

00:53.973 --> 00:55.440
What are you doing?

00:55.442 --> 00:57.108
Trying to sneak out
before you wake up

00:57.110 --> 00:58.977
and I realize what
a mistake this was.

00:58.979 --> 01:00.895
Really?

01:00.897 --> 01:02.230
'Cause you're
stomping around

01:02.232 --> 01:04.449
like someone desperately trying
to get my attention.

01:04.450 --> 01:06.401
You're dreaming.

01:06.403 --> 01:08.036
And I'm living
a nightmare.

01:08.038 --> 01:11.790
Hey, you're the one that came
running over here last night.

01:11.792 --> 01:13.575
You called me.

01:13.577 --> 01:15.193
You knew exactly
what for.

01:15.195 --> 01:16.378
Not at all.

01:16.380 --> 01:17.829
I thought you'd done
something stupid

01:17.831 --> 01:18.830
and needed my help.

01:18.832 --> 01:21.416
So you put on
slinky lingerie

01:21.418 --> 01:22.667
and changed
your clothes?

01:22.669 --> 01:26.004
I wear slinky lingerie
because I like feeling slinky.

01:26.006 --> 01:28.223
Why are you studying
my outfits?

01:28.225 --> 01:30.175
Please don't start
obsessing about me.

01:30.177 --> 01:32.177
This was a one time
only mistake.

01:32.179 --> 01:35.313
The faster you leave, the faster
I'll forget it ever happened.

01:35.315 --> 01:38.049
I was just trying to get
a mental picture

01:38.051 --> 01:40.769
to prevent this from
ever happening again.

01:40.771 --> 01:45.407
You, me, an overwhelming
feeling of shame.

01:45.409 --> 01:47.108
Yeah.

01:48.844 --> 01:50.945
Take a good
last look.

02:17.139 --> 02:18.523
I was holding
the medallion,

02:18.525 --> 02:20.241
standing under the
symbol in the basement,

02:20.243 --> 02:22.310
and I felt this crazy
rush of power.

02:22.312 --> 02:24.262
But the second that I did...

02:27.600 --> 02:31.436
I felt an incredibly clear
connection to my father.

02:31.438 --> 02:34.656
It was like his energy
was reaching out to me

02:34.658 --> 02:36.124
through the medallion.

02:36.126 --> 02:39.060
I think he was
trying to find me.

02:39.062 --> 02:41.880
I'm gonna go back there
later today and try again.

02:43.299 --> 02:45.116
Are you ok?
Fine.

02:45.118 --> 02:46.584
Is it Adam?

02:46.586 --> 02:48.970
Or is Adam in combination
with the greeting card,

02:48.972 --> 02:51.556
florist, chocolatier,
industrial complex?

02:51.558 --> 02:53.675
Well, no.

02:53.677 --> 02:55.677
In fact, I want this
Valentine's day

02:55.679 --> 02:58.763
to not be about relying on a guy
for happiness.

03:02.068 --> 03:05.487
Oh, I completely forget it's
anti-independence day.

03:05.489 --> 03:08.656
Or as I like to call it, the
loneliest holiday of the year.

03:08.658 --> 03:10.963
Just be thankful you're
not one of these needy,

03:10.988 --> 03:12.409
pathetic delusionals.

03:12.979 --> 03:14.612
What's going on?

03:14.614 --> 03:17.332
There's extra sparkle
in your bitchiness today.

03:17.334 --> 03:20.585
I stayed at Jake's
last night.

03:20.587 --> 03:22.454
Oh, you fell off
the Jake wagon.

03:22.456 --> 03:24.622
Technically
he fell off my wagon.

03:24.624 --> 03:26.291
This is where it starts.

03:26.293 --> 03:28.493
No. I won.

03:28.495 --> 03:30.128
He was feeling wounded
and reached out,

03:30.130 --> 03:32.997
and I made everything better.
Awesomely better.

03:32.999 --> 03:35.166
And then I left him
home alone to stew

03:35.168 --> 03:38.353
in why I'm the only one who can
make him feel like him.

03:38.355 --> 03:40.105
I've got the power back.

03:40.107 --> 03:41.523
Right.

03:41.525 --> 03:44.142
So what are you guys
doing for Valentine's day?

03:44.144 --> 03:47.345
I'm telling you,
it's over.

03:47.347 --> 03:50.148
Listen, screw boys.
They suck.

03:50.150 --> 03:53.151
A slumber party at my place.
No boys allowed.

03:53.153 --> 03:54.903
And we'll do
a horror movie marathon

03:54.905 --> 03:56.991
where we'll watch hearts
actually being ripped out

03:57.016 --> 03:58.124
of people's bodies.

03:58.125 --> 04:00.375
I'm in.

04:00.377 --> 04:01.576
Hey, guys.

04:01.578 --> 04:02.877
We're having a screw
Valentine's day

04:02.879 --> 04:04.162
slumber party
at Faye's tonight.

04:04.164 --> 04:05.296
You guys
want to come?

04:05.298 --> 04:06.648
Uh-uh. No way.

04:06.650 --> 04:08.216
No lame boy talk.

04:08.218 --> 04:09.584
Especially Adam talk.

04:09.586 --> 04:10.718
I promise.

04:10.720 --> 04:13.004
Faye, come on.

04:13.006 --> 04:14.255
Fine.

04:17.093 --> 04:18.676
Oh, uh, I forgot
my book.

04:18.678 --> 04:20.711
I'll meet you guys
in class.

04:28.571 --> 04:30.388
Hey.

04:30.390 --> 04:31.739
Hey.

04:31.741 --> 04:33.358
You kind of disappeared
last night.

04:33.360 --> 04:36.828
Yeah, just I needed
some time to sort everything out.

04:36.830 --> 04:39.280
I thought I saw you
with Jake.

04:39.282 --> 04:42.000
I was telling him that
he doesn't know me

04:42.002 --> 04:44.169
as well as he
thought he did.

04:45.771 --> 04:47.789
You want to do
something later?

04:47.791 --> 04:51.075
We could reminisce over any
number of near-death topics.

04:51.077 --> 04:52.861
I thought over dinner.

04:52.863 --> 04:56.064
Are you--I would--
I can't.

04:56.066 --> 04:57.382
I'd love to,
I really--

04:57.384 --> 04:58.883
oh, that's all right.
No, no, no.

04:58.885 --> 05:01.386
It's just Faye is
having this like

05:01.388 --> 05:04.355
slumber party and
anti-Valentine's day thing

05:04.357 --> 05:07.559
since it's Valentine's day
today.

05:07.561 --> 05:09.611
Is it?
Yeah.

05:09.613 --> 05:11.112
That's so random.

05:11.114 --> 05:14.065
Well, maybe we could
do something

05:14.067 --> 05:17.218
on a less
pressure-filled night.

05:17.220 --> 05:19.571
Like a date?

05:19.573 --> 05:21.956
Yeah.

05:21.958 --> 05:23.324
Like a date.

05:23.326 --> 05:24.509
Great.

05:24.511 --> 05:25.943
Great.

05:25.945 --> 05:28.413
Ok, I'm gonna go
get my book.

05:28.415 --> 05:30.448
See you.

05:36.589 --> 05:39.007

06:18.380 --> 06:20.782
So you're back from
your little family trip.

06:20.784 --> 06:22.884
I left a bunch
of messages.

06:22.886 --> 06:24.769
You just never
called back.

06:24.771 --> 06:26.604
You never got me
my own power.

06:26.606 --> 06:27.772
So now we both know

06:27.774 --> 06:30.174
what incredible disappointment
feels like.

06:30.176 --> 06:31.559
I got you your power.

06:31.561 --> 06:33.811
You and your friends
just didn't like the way I did it.

06:33.813 --> 06:37.231
But I brought you
something new.

06:40.619 --> 06:42.787
What is that?

06:42.789 --> 06:44.906
It's a power totem.

06:44.908 --> 06:47.542
It draws away weakness
to intensify your strength.

06:47.544 --> 06:49.410
Put this on your bed
for a few weeks

06:49.412 --> 06:51.245
and you'll be left
with nothing but pure power.

06:51.247 --> 06:53.848
Or it'll kill me
in my sleep.

06:53.850 --> 06:55.566
It's the real deal.

06:55.568 --> 06:58.803
Hmm.
Take it.

06:58.805 --> 07:01.055
Think of it as my version
of a dozen red roses

07:01.057 --> 07:03.641
since I also came to ask you
to dinner tonight.

07:03.643 --> 07:06.544
Yeah, no.

07:06.546 --> 07:08.062
But thanks anyway.

07:08.064 --> 07:10.064
And I thought the way
to your heart was through power.

07:10.066 --> 07:13.568
It is. But all you brought me
was a creepy doll.

07:13.570 --> 07:16.104
Me and that creepy doll
are gonna change your life.

07:16.106 --> 07:18.823
Let me know how
it goes, huh.

07:21.110 --> 07:22.893
I'm never gonna try it.

07:31.620 --> 07:33.504
What are you doing
here, Isaac?

07:33.506 --> 07:34.706
Death wish?

07:34.708 --> 07:36.124
I'm here to help you.

07:36.126 --> 07:38.159
Really?

07:40.796 --> 07:43.264
Uhh! Ahh!

07:43.266 --> 07:46.517
I saw what eben did
to my parents.

07:46.519 --> 07:48.553
I know you did.

07:48.555 --> 07:51.606
You told me that it was
the evil of witchcraft

07:51.608 --> 07:53.524
that destroyed my family.

07:53.526 --> 07:54.809
You lied.

07:54.811 --> 07:56.861
I never lied.

07:56.863 --> 08:01.866
What you saw that night
was only part of the story.

08:03.619 --> 08:07.672
My parents were willing
to give up witchcraft.

08:07.674 --> 08:09.574
All they wanted was peace.

08:09.576 --> 08:11.325
So did Eben.

08:11.327 --> 08:13.494
He called
for the truce,

08:13.496 --> 08:16.080
but Blackwell would have never
let it happen.

08:16.082 --> 08:18.299
He manipulated
the circle into thinking

08:18.301 --> 08:19.884
the hunters were
deceiving them.

08:19.886 --> 08:22.453
He lead your parents
to slaughter.

08:22.455 --> 08:24.138
I don't believe you.

08:24.140 --> 08:27.058
I understand.

08:27.060 --> 08:29.677
And I understand
why you came back.

08:29.679 --> 08:32.096
You know an attack
is coming on Cassie,

08:32.097 --> 08:33.931
on your
whole circle.

08:33.933 --> 08:36.933
I'm here to tell you
that you can stop it.

08:36.936 --> 08:40.421
How?

08:40.423 --> 08:42.657
The medallion
Cassie Blake found,

08:42.659 --> 08:46.611
if I bring it back to the
council, they will not attack.

08:46.613 --> 08:49.146
You really think
I'm an idiot.

08:49.148 --> 08:52.366
That medallion
saved Cassie's father.

08:52.368 --> 08:54.869
The council will never
get their hands on it.

08:54.871 --> 08:57.672
The medallion isn't
what you think it is.

08:57.674 --> 09:01.609
By activating it, Cassie has
put her life in danger.

09:01.611 --> 09:04.295
Evil will come for her.

09:04.297 --> 09:08.015
And the only way to save
her is to give to me.

09:09.601 --> 09:14.722
The vengeance that
I'm craving right now

09:14.724 --> 09:19.060
you brought out in me.

09:19.062 --> 09:23.681
I'm trying to
protect you, son.

09:23.683 --> 09:25.700
But you'll find out for
yourself soon enough

09:25.702 --> 09:27.368
what the medallion
brings.

09:29.671 --> 09:33.324
Go.

10:10.078 --> 10:11.946
Aah!

10:16.919 --> 10:18.202
Aah!

10:18.204 --> 10:19.370
Hey, hey, it's me.

10:19.372 --> 10:21.071
What's going on?

10:21.073 --> 10:23.591
There's...There's
someone down there.

10:23.593 --> 10:25.009
Who?

10:25.011 --> 10:28.629
A witch maybe.
I don't know.

10:48.144 --> 10:50.195
Just stay here.

10:59.855 --> 11:01.706
Are you sure
you saw someone?

11:01.708 --> 11:03.408
Positive.

11:04.460 --> 11:05.760
He was...

11:05.762 --> 11:07.145
He was wearing
the same robe

11:07.147 --> 11:09.364
that my father wore when the
witch hunters tried to kill him.

11:09.366 --> 11:12.133
The same one we wore
on Halloween.

11:12.135 --> 11:14.002
This robe had
a symbol on it.

11:16.405 --> 11:18.223
What?

11:18.225 --> 11:20.875
Why were you
down here?

11:20.877 --> 11:23.478
I was gonna use
the medallion

11:23.480 --> 11:26.214
to try and contact
my father.

11:26.216 --> 11:30.251
But this hooded thing was here,
just waiting for me.

11:30.253 --> 11:33.404
Do you think it has
something to do with him?

11:33.406 --> 11:34.656
I don't know.

11:34.658 --> 11:38.993
But yesterday...

11:38.995 --> 11:44.332
I felt like his energy
reached out to me.

11:44.334 --> 11:46.417
That has to be connected.

11:46.419 --> 11:47.886
You sure that's
a good thing?

11:47.888 --> 11:53.091
I know you don't
want to hear this,

11:53.093 --> 11:55.343
but if your
father's alive,

11:55.345 --> 11:59.130
he's had 16 years
to look for you

11:59.132 --> 12:02.050
and he hasn't.

12:02.052 --> 12:05.520
So why do you want
to look for him?

12:05.522 --> 12:11.059
Because he's my father.

12:11.061 --> 12:14.846
And if he's out there,
then I have to find him.

12:14.848 --> 12:17.365
And what about
his dark magic?

12:17.367 --> 12:19.600
Everything we've
heard about John Blackwell?

12:19.602 --> 12:22.987
I need to find out
for myself.

12:26.441 --> 12:28.376
You said there was
a symbol on the robe.

12:28.378 --> 12:29.610
Mm-hmm.

12:29.612 --> 12:31.079
Well, I hate
to say it,

12:31.081 --> 12:33.998
but if there's
one thing Jake is good for,

12:34.000 --> 12:36.084
it's knowing all
about witch hunters.

12:36.086 --> 12:39.304
You want me to talk
to Jake?

12:39.306 --> 12:40.705
No.

12:40.707 --> 12:46.477
But...If he has
information that can help.

12:48.681 --> 12:51.215
Then I'll ask him.

12:53.852 --> 12:56.437
Aren't those cute?

12:56.439 --> 12:58.273
It's a slumber party.

12:58.275 --> 13:00.358
How many wardrobe changes
are you planning?

13:00.360 --> 13:04.112
I guess I did
kind of over pack.

13:04.114 --> 13:05.613
Shocking.

13:05.615 --> 13:06.831
Oh!

13:06.833 --> 13:09.000
I'm so sorry.
Diana!

13:09.002 --> 13:10.268
What is that?

13:10.270 --> 13:12.370
Broken is what it is.

13:13.756 --> 13:15.656
I...

13:15.658 --> 13:17.175
It's ok.

13:17.177 --> 13:19.177
Nice.

13:20.546 --> 13:22.013
This was a bad idea.

13:22.015 --> 13:23.431
Faye doesn't want me here
to begin with.

13:23.433 --> 13:24.549
Well, I do.

13:24.551 --> 13:26.017
Deep down Faye does
as well.

13:26.019 --> 13:27.719
She's just too
preoccupied with stuff

13:27.721 --> 13:29.354
to realize it.

13:29.356 --> 13:32.523
I think I may have something
to loosen things up.

13:36.862 --> 13:38.846
It's called
devil's spirit.

13:38.848 --> 13:41.616
It's herbal
and totally mellow,

13:41.618 --> 13:43.368
and it'll just take
the edge off.

13:43.370 --> 13:46.487
Yeah. I promised myself
I was moving on tonight,

13:46.489 --> 13:47.872
but I'm not really sure
that's what I meant.

13:47.874 --> 13:49.290
Well, it's just
us girls,

13:49.292 --> 13:50.742
and now is
the perfect time

13:50.744 --> 13:52.543
to try something
a little different.

13:52.545 --> 13:54.796
Huh?

13:58.700 --> 14:00.752
Ok. Hurry up
before I change my mind.

14:04.673 --> 14:06.306
Do you know it
or what it could have

14:06.331 --> 14:08.127
to do with my father?

14:09.663 --> 14:12.997
You're sure this is
the symbol on the robe?

14:12.999 --> 14:15.266
Positive. Why?

14:15.268 --> 14:19.170
The symbol belonged
to the Nidaros coven.

14:19.172 --> 14:21.072
Really old blood.

14:21.074 --> 14:24.642
They came to Chance Harbor
directly from Europe, not Salem.

14:24.644 --> 14:28.496
But the entire coven
was destroyed years ago.

14:28.498 --> 14:31.616
So now I'm seeing
dead people?

14:31.618 --> 14:34.836
Did it say anything
to you?

14:34.838 --> 14:36.004
Or threaten you?

14:36.006 --> 14:37.188
No.

14:37.190 --> 14:40.258
There's something
you're not telling me.

14:40.260 --> 14:43.628
What does this have to do
with my father?

14:43.630 --> 14:48.282
I really have
no idea, I'm sorry.

14:51.520 --> 14:53.688
Movies.
I hear you. Whoa.

14:53.690 --> 14:54.939
Where the hell's Cassie?

14:54.941 --> 14:56.691
I don't know. I don't know.
Go text her.

14:58.227 --> 15:00.111
Wait, tell her
to hurry.

15:02.098 --> 15:04.482
Bitch, hurry.

15:04.484 --> 15:06.484
Pizza's ordered.

15:06.486 --> 15:08.369
Should be here
in 20.

15:08.371 --> 15:09.704
Oh, good, I'm hungry.

15:09.706 --> 15:11.406
We should order a pizza.

15:13.877 --> 15:15.109
Wait, check it out.

15:15.111 --> 15:16.461
When the pizza guy
gets here,

15:16.463 --> 15:17.795
let's do a spell so
we get it for free.

15:17.797 --> 15:20.031
Yes!
Seriously?

15:20.033 --> 15:22.166
Well, I could do that
by undoing two buttons.

15:22.168 --> 15:23.451
No, no, no, no.
I got it.

15:23.453 --> 15:25.470
Before the pizza guy
gets here,

15:25.472 --> 15:27.889
we're gonna do
a spell to make him hot.

15:27.891 --> 15:32.093
Ok, that could be the least
boring idea you've ever had.

15:32.095 --> 15:33.728
And when he gets here,

15:33.730 --> 15:35.229
I'm gonna make out
with him.

15:35.231 --> 15:36.397
Ok.

15:36.399 --> 15:39.016
Watch me.

15:39.018 --> 15:42.403
Ok. Ahem. Circle up.

15:44.907 --> 15:46.357
How do we do this?

15:46.359 --> 15:48.993
By making fire.

15:48.995 --> 15:53.247
Except we picture
the hottest guy imaginable.

15:53.249 --> 15:54.415
Ok.

16:04.711 --> 16:06.294
That was fast.

16:06.296 --> 16:07.995
I got it.

16:16.054 --> 16:17.722
Ok. Uh.

16:17.724 --> 16:20.558
Doesn't the fact that he's not
holding any pizzas

16:20.560 --> 16:22.009
tell you he's not
the pizza guy?

16:22.011 --> 16:23.694
Oh, I was too busy
kissing him.

16:23.696 --> 16:24.779
You invited him?

16:24.781 --> 16:27.131
Just to fix
what she ruined.

16:27.133 --> 16:29.200
Faye, the deal was no boys.

16:29.202 --> 16:31.869
That was a bad deal.

16:33.122 --> 16:34.288
I didn't know
you had company.

16:34.290 --> 16:36.958
Slumber party, actually.
Glad I called?

16:36.960 --> 16:38.376
We'll see.

16:38.378 --> 16:40.545
Right this way.

16:55.310 --> 16:57.545
"Bitch, hurry."

16:57.547 --> 16:59.814
Nice.

17:24.071 --> 17:26.491
Your friends seem
messed up on something.

17:27.087 --> 17:30.288
They're on your
devil's spirit.

17:30.290 --> 17:32.239
It's not mine. And I told you,
it's dangerous stuff.

17:32.241 --> 17:35.093
It took someone
very important away from me.

17:35.095 --> 17:37.462
Your old girlfriend.
I know.

17:37.464 --> 17:39.697
But don't worry
about those two.

17:39.699 --> 17:41.132
I've got my eye
on them.

17:41.134 --> 17:42.433
Where's the patient?

17:48.857 --> 17:50.358
Can you fix it?

17:50.360 --> 17:51.692
I think so.

17:51.694 --> 17:53.227
And it'll still work?

17:53.229 --> 17:55.262
So now you believe
it's real?

17:55.264 --> 17:58.633
I don't know why you would come
all this way to fix a fake.

18:05.073 --> 18:07.208
It worked.

18:07.210 --> 18:08.543
You did order
a pizza, right?

18:08.545 --> 18:11.129
Actually,
we ordered you.

18:17.719 --> 18:19.787
Mmm.
Mm-mmm.

18:21.924 --> 18:23.891
Keep the change.

18:27.514 --> 18:28.763
Oh, my God.

18:28.765 --> 18:30.932
Aah!

18:32.685 --> 18:34.674
I got--no, I got it.

18:34.675 --> 18:36.141
You want
another tip?

18:36.167 --> 18:37.717
Were you just kissing
the delivery guy?

18:37.719 --> 18:39.552
We did a spell

18:39.554 --> 18:41.270
to make him hot,

18:41.272 --> 18:43.055
so we get
to kiss him.

18:43.057 --> 18:44.674
Ok, maybe I should go.

18:44.676 --> 18:46.359
I'm not really in
the party mood.

18:46.361 --> 18:47.476
Don't you dare
leave.

18:47.478 --> 18:49.478
It's girl's night.

18:49.480 --> 18:51.781
Give me that.

19:02.926 --> 19:05.461
Something's happened.

19:05.463 --> 19:09.365
Cassie's being
haunted by a dead witch

19:09.367 --> 19:12.201
from the Nidaros
coven.

19:12.203 --> 19:14.670
Does that have anything to do
with the medallion?

19:14.672 --> 19:18.057
Are the witches you killed
coming after Cassie now?

19:18.059 --> 19:21.310
We didn't kill
the Nidaros coven.

19:21.312 --> 19:23.312
Cassie's father did.

19:23.314 --> 19:24.814
You're lying.

19:24.816 --> 19:27.116
Their blood spilled
in a church

19:27.118 --> 19:29.919
less than a mile from where
you're standing right now.

19:29.921 --> 19:32.805
But killing them
wasn't enough.

19:32.807 --> 19:36.859
He used see medallion
to steal their powers.

19:36.861 --> 19:38.461
They must want them back.

19:38.463 --> 19:41.731
But they're dead.

19:41.733 --> 19:43.916
The minute Cassie
activated the medallion,

19:43.918 --> 19:46.685
she alerted every dead witch
whose power it's taken.

19:46.687 --> 19:49.155
They sense its presence.

19:49.157 --> 19:51.774
And they'll do anything
to get it.

19:51.776 --> 19:56.045
As long as Cassie
holds the medallion,

19:56.047 --> 19:58.063
they'll come for it.

19:58.065 --> 20:01.416
And Nidaros coven
is just the beginning.

20:01.418 --> 20:03.853
But if you give me
the medallion,

20:03.855 --> 20:07.106
I can help her.

20:07.108 --> 20:09.892
And why's it
so important?

20:09.894 --> 20:14.280
That medallion holds the power
of a thousand cursed souls.

20:14.282 --> 20:17.466
Its evil is
unquantifiable.

20:17.468 --> 20:19.401
No witch hunter could
ever use its power,

20:19.403 --> 20:22.139
but surely you can see
that no witch should

20:22.164 --> 20:23.662
be able to, either.

20:23.991 --> 20:26.792
The medallion will
kill her.

20:26.794 --> 20:30.663
And if I don't bring it
back with me,

20:30.665 --> 20:32.447
we'll all die with her.

20:45.345 --> 20:49.732
He fixed the thing,
then he left.

20:49.734 --> 20:52.017
Something freaky happened
to Cassie.

20:52.019 --> 20:53.802
Yeah, of course it did.

20:53.804 --> 20:56.222
Otherwise how else could this
night become all about her?

20:56.224 --> 20:58.457
I saw a ghost.

20:58.459 --> 21:00.242
In the basement of
the abandoned house.

21:00.244 --> 21:04.330
And then the medallion
moved on its own.

21:04.332 --> 21:06.348
You actually saw
a ghost?

21:06.350 --> 21:08.033
I think it was
trying to tell me something.

21:08.035 --> 21:11.754
And I got so scared when I
first saw it that I ran out,

21:11.756 --> 21:13.873
but when I came
back, it was gone.

21:13.875 --> 21:15.708
I looked through
the Book of Shadows,

21:15.710 --> 21:18.344
but there's nothing
about contacting ghosts.

21:18.346 --> 21:20.246
You want to speak
to the dead,

21:20.248 --> 21:23.933
I think I have
just the thing.

21:35.029 --> 21:36.178
Nothing's happening.

21:36.180 --> 21:38.113
This is so lame.

21:38.115 --> 21:39.782
We're witches.
It should work.

21:39.784 --> 21:42.151
Apparently not.

21:42.153 --> 21:44.703
But...

21:47.791 --> 21:49.909
Maybe this will.

21:51.211 --> 21:52.244
Is this a good idea?

21:52.246 --> 21:54.580
Let's find out.

21:56.917 --> 22:00.419
I'm trying to contact
the spirit that's following me.

22:00.421 --> 22:02.304
Are you there?

22:08.745 --> 22:10.763
Let's try it again.
So sorry.

22:13.183 --> 22:15.901
What are you trying
to tell me?

22:19.322 --> 22:21.106
I'm not doing that.
Me, neither.

22:21.108 --> 22:23.926
What?
Oh, my God.

22:23.928 --> 22:25.110
"S."

22:28.665 --> 22:30.249
"A."

22:30.251 --> 22:32.585
Oh, my God.

22:32.587 --> 22:34.069
"C."

22:36.873 --> 22:38.290
"R."

22:40.844 --> 22:43.212
"E."

22:43.214 --> 22:44.246
"D."

22:44.248 --> 22:46.415
Sacred.
What's sacred?

22:46.417 --> 22:47.933
What does that mean?

22:47.935 --> 22:50.386
Maybe that the witch
was sacred

22:50.388 --> 22:52.304
or buried in
sacred ground?

22:52.306 --> 22:54.807
Your--your father's
sacred to you.

22:54.809 --> 22:57.476
You're the most sacred witch
in all the land.

23:02.316 --> 23:04.016
You two are acting
like idiots.

23:04.018 --> 23:05.651
This is serious.

23:05.653 --> 23:07.436
Ok.
Come on.

23:07.438 --> 23:09.488
Group hug.
Come on. Come on.

23:09.490 --> 23:11.440
Come on.
No, thanks.

23:11.442 --> 23:12.958
Group hug?

23:12.960 --> 23:15.628
Group hug.
Come on.

23:15.630 --> 23:17.746
Since the medallion
doesn't want to talk anymore,

23:17.748 --> 23:19.832
why don't we just
keep partying?

23:19.834 --> 23:22.801
I want pizza.
Oh, me, too.

23:26.007 --> 23:28.123
Sacred.

23:49.496 --> 23:52.698
Oh. Sorry for
all the laughing.

23:52.700 --> 23:53.982
I'm just a little
messed up.

23:53.984 --> 23:55.534
I think I'm gonna
head out.

23:55.536 --> 23:57.586
I'm just bringing
you guys down.

23:57.588 --> 23:58.871
So I'm gonna go.

23:58.873 --> 24:00.172
Who are you texting?

24:01.207 --> 24:04.659
Ahh, Adam.

24:04.661 --> 24:08.547
The pull of Valentine's day takes
another victim.

24:08.549 --> 24:11.550
He's just trying to help me
figure out what's going on.

24:11.552 --> 24:13.519
I won't tell anybody.

24:13.521 --> 24:15.854
I'll probably forget
in two seconds anyway.

24:26.817 --> 24:29.985
Did you sluts order
another hot pizza guy?

24:32.305 --> 24:36.358
Sorry. Sexy slumber party.
No boys allowed.

24:36.360 --> 24:38.310
I need to talk
to Cassie.

24:38.312 --> 24:39.912
I've been trying to
call her all night.

24:39.914 --> 24:42.548
You're not
a hot pizza guy.

24:42.550 --> 24:44.333
And Cassie just left.

24:44.335 --> 24:46.969
So you're out of luck.

24:46.971 --> 24:49.054
Where'd she go?

24:51.141 --> 24:52.508
It's important,
Melissa.

24:52.510 --> 24:58.263
To Adam's.

25:36.970 --> 25:38.437
Aah!

25:56.596 --> 25:58.463
Cute.

25:58.465 --> 26:01.333
You know, sometimes
less is more.

26:01.335 --> 26:03.569
What are you doing
here, Jake?

26:03.571 --> 26:05.437
Looking for Cassie.

26:05.439 --> 26:08.774
Well, obviously she's
got other plans,

26:08.776 --> 26:10.242
so see you.

26:10.244 --> 26:11.944
She should be here.

26:11.946 --> 26:15.747
I was just at Faye's house.
She left already.

26:15.749 --> 26:18.700
What the hell's
going on now?

26:18.702 --> 26:22.153
I'm not sure, but she
could be in trouble.

26:24.173 --> 26:25.507
Coming, lover boy?

27:03.963 --> 27:06.465
Hey!

27:10.803 --> 27:12.754
Hey!

27:18.011 --> 27:20.429
Every time Cassie's
in trouble you're lurking.

27:20.431 --> 27:22.547
What about these hooded
things she's been seeing,

27:22.549 --> 27:24.099
what, are those
witch hunters, too?

27:24.101 --> 27:27.436
No. They're witches.

27:27.438 --> 27:30.906
Dead witches.

27:32.075 --> 27:34.225
Diana.
What's wrong?

27:34.227 --> 27:36.244
Do you know where
Cassie is?

27:36.246 --> 27:37.746
I'm with Jake.
We can't find her.

27:37.748 --> 27:39.498
Oh, how adorable.

27:39.500 --> 27:43.168
You and Jake together
looking for Cassie.

27:43.170 --> 27:44.369
I've got to go.

27:44.371 --> 27:45.704
Has she gone back there?

27:45.706 --> 27:46.822
No.

27:46.824 --> 27:50.342
You know, maybe she
found a third boyfriend.

27:50.344 --> 27:51.460
What?

27:51.462 --> 27:53.679
You boys have fun
chasing Cassie.

27:53.681 --> 27:55.547
Well, what?

28:01.604 --> 28:05.307
How's it feeling being
replaced by Cassie?

28:05.309 --> 28:07.309
You would see it
that way.

28:07.311 --> 28:10.445
Faye, all you ever
think about is yourself.

28:10.447 --> 28:12.948
And your point is?

28:12.950 --> 28:15.600
You're the one who's worried
about being replaced.

28:15.602 --> 28:19.371
You think I haven't
noticed how jealous you are

28:19.373 --> 28:21.323
over my friendship
with Melissa?

28:21.325 --> 28:23.825
You think I'm jealous
of you?

28:23.827 --> 28:24.993
Yeah, I do.

28:24.995 --> 28:27.679
Maybe if you'd been
a better best friend,

28:27.681 --> 28:29.614
you wouldn't be so worried
about losing her right now.

28:29.616 --> 28:32.467
I guess you've forgotten
all about junior high

28:32.469 --> 28:34.803
when you dumped Melissa
as a BFF

28:34.805 --> 28:37.356
the second that you
and Adam got serious.

28:40.259 --> 28:42.561
Wait, where is Melissa
anyway?

28:47.299 --> 28:49.067
Oh, my God.
Melissa!

28:49.069 --> 28:50.969
What happened?
What's wrong?

28:50.971 --> 28:52.320
What happened?
What did she do?

28:52.322 --> 28:53.822
Talk to me.
Melissa, wake up.

28:53.824 --> 28:55.073
Hey, hey, hey.
Wake up.

28:55.075 --> 28:56.575
Hey, talk to me.
Wake up.

28:56.577 --> 28:57.776
Melissa, wake up.

28:57.778 --> 28:58.944
Did you take
the rest of this?

28:58.946 --> 29:00.645
Come on, we gotta get her
to the bathroom.

29:00.647 --> 29:02.414
Come on.

29:02.416 --> 29:03.749
Good.

29:19.715 --> 29:21.016
Cassie's not here.

29:21.018 --> 29:23.018
Do you think those dead witches--
I hope not.

29:23.020 --> 29:24.219
What do they want
with her?

29:24.221 --> 29:27.005
Blackwell used his medallion to
steal their power.

29:27.007 --> 29:28.557
And now Cassie has
the medallion.

29:28.559 --> 29:30.308
So, what, they want
their power back?

29:30.310 --> 29:31.643
How do you know
all this?

29:31.645 --> 29:32.944
I just do.

29:32.946 --> 29:34.863
Adam, we've got
to find Cassie.

29:34.865 --> 29:37.482
All right, where
would they take her?

29:37.484 --> 29:39.618
They can't take her anywhere.
They're dead.

29:39.620 --> 29:41.453
Their power's tied
to the medallion.

29:41.455 --> 29:45.490
All they can do is show up
and disappear.

29:45.492 --> 29:46.708
What?

29:46.710 --> 29:48.877
Blackwell killed them in a church
near here.

29:48.879 --> 29:50.045
So?

29:50.047 --> 29:51.296
When a witch
is murdered,

29:51.298 --> 29:53.081
some of its energy stays
where it was killed.

29:53.083 --> 29:55.300
These witches have more
power at the church.

29:55.302 --> 29:57.252
If they lead Cassie
there, she's in danger.

29:57.254 --> 29:58.553
Well, let's go.

30:03.843 --> 30:06.128
Hey!

30:06.130 --> 30:08.046
Who are you?

30:09.265 --> 30:11.549
Who are you?

30:19.609 --> 30:22.110
Stop!

30:49.266 --> 30:50.598
You're ok.

30:50.600 --> 30:51.733
You're gonna be ok.

30:51.735 --> 30:54.335
I can't believe you did
those drugs with her.

30:54.337 --> 30:56.371
I can't believe you
introduced them to her.

30:57.774 --> 30:59.774
God, I'm sorry.
No, no, no, it's ok.

30:59.776 --> 31:02.360
Come on, let's get
you cleaned up.

31:34.777 --> 31:36.978
Where are you?

31:36.980 --> 31:38.730
Where are you?

31:41.700 --> 31:43.701
I saw you.

31:45.538 --> 31:48.623
Come out!

31:54.980 --> 31:57.632
Face me!

32:02.338 --> 32:05.273
What do you want?

32:13.265 --> 32:16.601
Wait, don't.

32:16.603 --> 32:20.655
Wait, wait. Don't!

32:23.492 --> 32:24.943
Cassie.

32:28.697 --> 32:30.031
Hold on.

32:30.033 --> 32:31.749
Hold on. We don't know
what they're after.

32:31.751 --> 32:34.752
She needs us. Now.

32:34.754 --> 32:37.071
Adam!

32:37.073 --> 32:38.840
Adam, run.

32:40.042 --> 32:42.010
Run!

33:15.160 --> 33:17.629
Adam?

33:18.647 --> 33:20.498
Adam?
Stop.

33:21.617 --> 33:23.668
They went into Adam.

33:23.670 --> 33:25.386
Cassie, stay away
from him.

33:25.388 --> 33:28.306
Give us the medallion.

33:31.594 --> 33:33.628
We want our power back.

33:37.266 --> 33:39.133
You took it from us.

33:39.135 --> 33:41.019
It wasn't Cassie.

33:41.021 --> 33:42.604
It was her father.

33:42.606 --> 33:44.405
What are you talking about?

33:44.407 --> 33:46.441
Your father killed
the Nidaros coven.

33:46.443 --> 33:48.443
How do you know that?

33:48.445 --> 33:51.496
Isaac told me.

33:52.865 --> 33:54.566
Isaac?

33:54.568 --> 33:56.034
He wants
the medallion.

33:56.036 --> 33:57.168
If we give it to him
he'll help us.

33:57.170 --> 34:00.488
It belongs to us.
It contains our power.

34:00.490 --> 34:04.726
No. It has the power
of thousands of witches.

34:04.728 --> 34:06.177
And now that
it's activated,

34:06.179 --> 34:07.612
all of them
will come for it.

34:07.614 --> 34:09.597
Dead or alive.

34:09.599 --> 34:11.266
It's too dangerous.

34:14.937 --> 34:18.005
Give us
the medallion

34:18.007 --> 34:21.007
or we kill
this shell.

34:21.010 --> 34:22.176
Stop, don't hurt him!

34:22.178 --> 34:23.393
If you give it to them,

34:23.396 --> 34:24.679
the coven won't only
get their power,

34:24.681 --> 34:25.746
they'll get all of it.

34:25.748 --> 34:28.283
6 witches with the power
of thousands.

34:28.284 --> 34:29.650
They'll be unstoppable.

34:29.652 --> 34:30.985
They'll kill you,
Cassie.

34:30.987 --> 34:32.620
Your father
destroyed them.

34:32.621 --> 34:34.539
The moment you give them
their power back,

34:34.541 --> 34:35.907
they'll destroy you,
too.

34:35.909 --> 34:37.525
If I don't,
they'll kill Adam.

34:37.527 --> 34:38.793
Give us the medallion.

34:38.795 --> 34:40.878
I choose you.

34:42.665 --> 34:43.965
Don't!

34:46.702 --> 34:48.085
Give us
the medallion!

34:48.088 --> 34:49.304
Cassie, no, please!

34:49.306 --> 34:50.972
I don't have a choice.

35:19.702 --> 35:22.470
No.

35:36.853 --> 35:38.436
Adam! Adam!

35:42.525 --> 35:44.726
It's ok, it's ok,
it's ok.

35:44.728 --> 35:46.444
They're gone.
They're gone.

35:46.446 --> 35:47.729
Ok. Ok.

35:47.731 --> 35:50.698
They're gone.

35:53.318 --> 35:55.903
They're gone.

35:55.905 --> 35:57.538
It's ok.

35:59.180 --> 36:00.380
It's over.

36:09.518 --> 36:12.754
The witches are gone.

36:12.756 --> 36:15.823
Here's the medallion.

36:19.261 --> 36:20.928
You're welcome.

36:20.930 --> 36:22.814
Our deal was
for the medallion,

36:22.816 --> 36:24.599
not a piece of it.

36:24.601 --> 36:26.534
You should be happy.

36:26.536 --> 36:28.686
You're not a witch.
You can't use it.

36:28.688 --> 36:30.571
Why do you care?

36:30.573 --> 36:33.758
You should have
honored our deal.

36:33.760 --> 36:36.027
I could have spared
you and Cassie.

36:36.029 --> 36:38.696
You didn't answer
the question.

36:38.698 --> 36:41.532
Why would you want
the medallion?

36:46.688 --> 36:49.574
Your anger
makes you weak.

36:49.576 --> 36:52.460
It prevents you
from seeing the truth.

36:52.462 --> 36:56.547
There's nothing more
I can do for you.

37:23.391 --> 37:26.427
Melissa's feeling better,
so I'm gonna go.

37:26.429 --> 37:28.279
Just grab my stuff.

37:28.281 --> 37:30.148
You should stay.

37:30.150 --> 37:33.451
Not that I care one way
or another,

37:33.453 --> 37:36.821
but Melissa obviously
wanted your help, so.

37:39.625 --> 37:43.077
I screwed up
back in junior high, ok?

37:43.079 --> 37:48.916
But I am never gonna
leave Melissa as a friend again,

37:48.918 --> 37:52.053
no matter what.

37:52.055 --> 37:54.889
I know you won't.

37:54.891 --> 37:57.358
Because I'll
make sure of it.

37:59.528 --> 38:02.113
I got it.

38:31.894 --> 38:34.812
It's gonna be ok.

38:34.814 --> 38:38.099
I figured out a way
to make you better.

38:40.353 --> 38:42.970
Worst Valentine's day
ever.

38:42.972 --> 38:45.022
Yep.

38:45.024 --> 38:47.325
You have to quit
that stuff.

38:47.327 --> 38:49.493
Lee says it's
really dangerous.

38:49.495 --> 38:51.412
That guy likes you.

38:51.414 --> 38:53.447
I guess he's not as bad
as I thought.

38:53.449 --> 38:55.216
Mm-mmm.

38:55.218 --> 38:58.002
I am done with guys.

39:00.589 --> 39:02.673
For now.

39:02.675 --> 39:05.593
Oh, too bad.
He's a really good kisser.

39:08.297 --> 39:09.680
Really?
Guy, guys, don't.

39:09.682 --> 39:11.382
No pillow fighting.
Ha ha!

39:11.384 --> 39:12.767
Oh, well...

39:37.125 --> 39:39.794
This may or may not be
what you think.

39:39.796 --> 39:44.248
A surprise
Valentine's day dinner.

39:44.250 --> 39:45.750
Planned for earlier.

39:45.752 --> 39:47.168
Pre-possession.

39:47.170 --> 39:51.005
Hmm. So random.

39:51.007 --> 39:54.258
Oh. So you caught that
today, huh?

39:54.260 --> 39:57.428
Oh, yeah.

39:59.431 --> 40:01.882
Happy Valentine's day.

40:01.884 --> 40:03.884
Thank you.

40:04.870 --> 40:07.355
It's beautiful.

40:07.357 --> 40:13.444
Just I--I wish I would have
made it in time.

40:13.446 --> 40:16.747
You're here now.

40:19.901 --> 40:22.086
You were right.

40:22.088 --> 40:25.072
About my father.

40:25.074 --> 40:28.009
I think I let
the idea of him

40:28.011 --> 40:30.711
overshadow the reality.

40:30.713 --> 40:33.580
He killed that coven.

40:33.582 --> 40:37.852
And I don't know who else.

40:37.854 --> 40:42.657
I think he should just say
wherever he's been hiding.

40:42.659 --> 40:45.126
I don't want to know him.

40:45.128 --> 40:47.862
After having spent
some quality time

40:47.864 --> 40:49.780
with those witches
tonight,

40:49.782 --> 40:52.766
I can tell you they're not so
great. So.

40:55.770 --> 40:58.939
I just didn't want
to think that he was a...

40:58.941 --> 41:03.077
A terrible person
because...

41:03.079 --> 41:08.249
I didn't want to believe
that I am, too.

41:08.251 --> 41:10.835
You're not.

41:14.423 --> 41:17.007
You're amazing.
