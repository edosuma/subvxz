01:37.280 --> 01:41.251
<i>Red lip classic thing that you like</i>

01:41.400 --> 01:43.368
<i>And when we go crashing down</i>

01:45.880 --> 01:51.125
<i>We never go out of style
We never go out of style</i>

02:42.120 --> 02:43.645
Ugh.

03:10.440 --> 03:11.487
Help!

03:30.520 --> 03:33.729
So, I understand that you all were
part of the 58th Rescue Squadron...

03:33.880 --> 03:37.407
...staged over at Bagram in Afghanistan
for combat search and rescue.

03:37.560 --> 03:38.971
Yes, ma'am. Two tours.

03:39.120 --> 03:40.485
And you're still flying together?

03:40.640 --> 03:43.166
We all got tight over there.
Wouldn't wanna break up the family.

03:43.640 --> 03:45.483
Dude, do we look like family?

03:45.640 --> 03:46.801
A little.

03:47.200 --> 03:51.842
So, what's the biggest difference between
rescuing over there and what you do here?

03:52.560 --> 03:53.766
Not getting shot at.

03:54.680 --> 03:56.284
- You're a funny guy.
- Yeah.

03:59.200 --> 04:01.043
Uh, Chief Gaines?

04:01.480 --> 04:04.848
I'm told that between
Afghanistan and LAFD...

04:05.000 --> 04:07.890
...you have over 600
documented rescues.

04:08.360 --> 04:09.885
That's pretty impressive.

04:10.280 --> 04:12.009
Just doing my job, ma'am.

04:12.280 --> 04:13.884
Go where they tell me to go.

04:14.520 --> 04:16.726
Heh. That's great. You can cut there.

04:23.320 --> 04:24.731
There she is.

04:29.760 --> 04:31.250
Looks pretty tight.

04:32.320 --> 04:33.367
Take her up.

04:44.920 --> 04:49.005
<i>Winds are variable,
270 to 300. 10 knots gusting to 15.</i>

04:54.680 --> 04:57.968
Metro, this is LAFD.
Helo 5 on scene of cliff-V rescue.

04:58.120 --> 04:59.121
We have visual.

04:59.280 --> 05:01.601
<i>- Copy, Helo 5.</i>
- What's the girl's name?

05:02.840 --> 05:04.126
Natalie.

05:04.320 --> 05:06.129
Metro, connect her cell
to our sat phone.

05:07.160 --> 05:08.810
<i>Helo 5, you're connected.</i>

05:10.960 --> 05:11.961
Hello?

05:12.160 --> 05:15.369
<i>This is Chief Pilot Raymond Gaines
of the Los Angeles Fire Department.</i>

05:15.520 --> 05:18.808
I'm piloting the chopper above you.
You holding up all right?

05:19.000 --> 05:21.241
I don't know. I'm not feeling very well.

05:22.840 --> 05:24.888
Oh, my God! The car is sliding.

05:25.040 --> 05:27.168
<i>Natalie, I'm gonna need you
to stay calm, honey.</i>

05:27.560 --> 05:29.847
- We're coming to get you, okay?
- Okay.

05:31.280 --> 05:32.691
<i>Seven miles visibility...</i>

05:32.840 --> 05:34.842
<i>...winds are 270 at 10 knots.</i>

05:35.200 --> 05:37.646
<i>We show you
one plus one five playtime.</i>

05:40.440 --> 05:41.930
Man, I don't see a way in.

05:43.520 --> 05:45.045
We're gonna tip the hat.

05:46.560 --> 05:47.641
- Tip the hat?
- Yeah.

05:48.000 --> 05:49.525
You might wanna hold on to something.

05:49.960 --> 05:51.200
Here we go.

05:56.200 --> 05:57.247
Fifteen feet out.

05:58.640 --> 05:59.687
Ten feet.

06:01.520 --> 06:02.521
<i>Five.</i>

06:02.680 --> 06:04.250
Whoa, whoa. Easy, Ray.

06:06.600 --> 06:08.045
<i>All right, you got it.</i>

06:13.920 --> 06:14.967
<i>All right.</i>

06:15.120 --> 06:16.565
Tuck them in, boys.

06:20.120 --> 06:21.884
Joby, forget the basket.

06:22.040 --> 06:24.441
We gotta do a double tie-in
on this one.

06:24.720 --> 06:26.609
That car goes, so does she.

06:32.160 --> 06:33.321
<i>Door's open.</i>

06:33.560 --> 06:34.686
Get this.

06:37.280 --> 06:38.361
Hooking up.

06:45.800 --> 06:47.040
<i>On the skid.</i>

06:50.360 --> 06:51.771
We got five minutes max.

06:52.360 --> 06:54.010
What happens in five minutes?

06:54.160 --> 06:56.527
It's no big deal. Just engine failure.

06:58.000 --> 06:59.650
Good thing I only need three.

07:07.200 --> 07:08.960
- Oh, thank God.
- No, no! Natalie, do not...

07:09.960 --> 07:11.530
Oh, my God! Get me out of here.

07:11.680 --> 07:13.967
I need you to stay still.
I have to stabilize the car.

07:14.200 --> 07:15.281
Hurry, please.

07:26.680 --> 07:27.966
Car secured.

07:35.240 --> 07:36.287
Got it.

07:41.200 --> 07:42.247
What the hell?

07:44.280 --> 07:45.611
Shit.

07:47.360 --> 07:49.727
Dylan! Oh, my God. Are you all right?

07:50.840 --> 07:53.002
Jesus. Joby's pinned!

07:53.520 --> 07:54.965
Ugh. Goddamn it.

08:07.600 --> 08:09.489
Joby, I'm coming down.

08:09.720 --> 08:12.007
Harrison, you're flying.
Marcus, rig me a rope.

08:12.160 --> 08:13.400
- Handing over.
- Taking over.

08:17.120 --> 08:18.770
- Be ready to cut.
- Roger that.

08:29.080 --> 08:30.411
Hooked up.

08:30.800 --> 08:32.164
Out the door.

08:32.720 --> 08:33.881
Ray's clear.

08:42.640 --> 08:44.927
Natalie, don't you worry.
I'm gonna get you out...

08:51.560 --> 08:52.891
This thing isn't gonna hold!

08:53.760 --> 08:55.842
Ray, we are in the red!
We are going to crash!

08:56.480 --> 08:58.244
Natalie, we are going now!

09:01.160 --> 09:02.207
I got you!

09:02.880 --> 09:05.042
- Cut it!
- Joby, swing!

09:21.720 --> 09:22.767
Yeah!

09:23.040 --> 09:24.804
What do we say we get you home now?

09:25.000 --> 09:26.684
I think that's a really good idea.

09:30.120 --> 09:33.283
<i>Now, the Sendai quake
in Japan was considered...</i>

09:33.440 --> 09:35.920
...one of the five strongest since 1900.

09:36.080 --> 09:37.445
It was so powerful, in fact...

09:37.600 --> 09:41.810
...that it moved the main island
of Japan eight feet.

09:42.920 --> 09:47.721
This is just one
of the 1.3 million earthquakes...

09:47.880 --> 09:50.486
...that occur around the globe
each year.

09:50.680 --> 09:53.729
The largest ever recorded here
in North America:

09:53.880 --> 09:57.805
Anchorage, Alaska, 1964. A 9.1.

10:00.280 --> 10:02.931
The earth shook for five straight minutes.

10:03.120 --> 10:06.806
The energy release was the equivalent
of 10 million atom bombs...

10:07.000 --> 10:09.571
...the size of the one
dropped on Hiroshima.

10:09.720 --> 10:11.927
And that's not the biggest earthquake
ever recorded.

10:12.080 --> 10:16.881
No, the biggest was four years earlier off
the coast of Valdivia in Southern Chile.

10:17.040 --> 10:19.202
A 9.5 on the Richter scale.

10:19.800 --> 10:21.086
Right there.

10:22.800 --> 10:23.847
Bam.

10:24.840 --> 10:29.562
This quake lasted 11 minutes
and spawned a tsunami 82 feet high...

10:29.720 --> 10:32.724
...that leveled Hilo, Hawaii
8000 miles away.

10:33.360 --> 10:36.045
8000 miles away.

10:37.360 --> 10:39.044
So, um...

10:40.680 --> 10:43.763
It's mass destruction like this...

10:43.920 --> 10:47.242
...that shows just how important
the research that we're doing here is...

10:47.400 --> 10:50.244
...because we need to be able
to predict these things. Right?

10:50.400 --> 10:52.164
To plan and prepare for them.
Yes, ma'am.

10:52.600 --> 10:55.922
Professor, do you think something
that intense could happen here?

10:56.280 --> 10:59.841
Well, the San Andreas fault
runs right up the spine of California.

11:00.000 --> 11:05.245
It's the demarcation line between two
tectonic plates that are constantly moving.

11:06.080 --> 11:10.210
And add to that the fact that
it's supposed to happen every 150 years...

11:10.520 --> 11:13.285
...and we're about 100 years overdue...

11:14.240 --> 11:16.322
...I'd say it's not a matter of if...

11:17.160 --> 11:18.844
...it's a matter of when.

11:22.240 --> 11:25.562
Damn, Godzilla.
What the hell'd you do to her this time?

11:25.960 --> 11:27.724
Played a little tug of war with a car.

11:27.880 --> 11:29.405
How soon before you get her fixed?

11:29.560 --> 11:33.087
I'll call Martinez today.
Get a new one sent over to maintenance.

11:33.240 --> 11:36.005
Elgin, you move any faster,
you're gonna break that hip.

11:37.920 --> 11:40.201
Harrison said you're taking off
with Blake for a few days.

11:40.320 --> 11:43.130
Yeah. Leaving tomorrow.
Driving her back up to school.

11:43.280 --> 11:45.248
Volleyball team has their first game
this weekend.

11:45.400 --> 11:47.480
I figure we cruise up the coast.
Do a little camping.

11:47.960 --> 11:49.962
Dude, I can't believe
she's in college already.

11:50.120 --> 11:51.565
I know.

11:51.720 --> 11:54.530
- Too fast, brother. I'll catch you inside.
- All right, man.

12:01.920 --> 12:04.207
- Lawrence, I gotta show you something.
- Yeah?

12:04.600 --> 12:06.011
Aha!

12:06.200 --> 12:09.409
Now, we got a rare low-level
seismic swarm out in Falco, Nevada.

12:09.560 --> 12:14.043
23 small quakes, all tiny.
2.0 to 2.6 in the last 24 hours.

12:14.200 --> 12:15.770
Where the hell is Falco, Nevada?

12:15.960 --> 12:19.328
35 miles southeast of Vegas,
maybe 5 miles from the Hoover Dam.

12:19.480 --> 12:20.527
All right.

12:21.640 --> 12:23.369
There aren't any faults out there.

12:23.560 --> 12:26.803
Any known faults. Now, if we get there
while the mini quakes continue...

12:26.960 --> 12:28.246
...we can test our theory.

12:28.640 --> 12:31.769
And if the magnetic pulse rate
goes up before the quakes...

12:31.920 --> 12:34.605
- Then we're predicting them.
- Then we are predicting them.

12:35.160 --> 12:36.400
All right.

12:36.560 --> 12:38.130
Let's go check it out.

12:57.680 --> 12:59.170
<i>- Hi, Dad.</i>
- Hey, sweetie.

12:59.320 --> 13:01.129
I was wondering if there was room
for my bike.

13:01.280 --> 13:04.520
Thought that I could ride it to class,
then I wouldn't have to buy a parking pass.

13:04.640 --> 13:08.087
That's a great idea. I'm sure
I could figure out a way to fit it in.

13:08.240 --> 13:11.164
<i>All right, great. I can't find the key
to the lock at Mom's...</i>

13:11.360 --> 13:14.330
<i>...so it's either in the top left drawer
of my dresser...</i>

13:14.520 --> 13:16.443
<i>...or on top of the wardrobe
in my pink shoe box.</i>

13:16.600 --> 13:17.931
Okay, no problem. I'll find it.

13:18.200 --> 13:21.044
I don't know if you have plans,
but I would love to take you to dinner.

13:21.200 --> 13:23.441
You could even invite your mom along.
It'd be fun.

13:23.600 --> 13:24.840
<i>Oh, thanks, Dad.</i>

13:25.000 --> 13:27.207
<i>But we already have plans with Daniel.</i>

13:29.880 --> 13:31.006
Dad?

13:31.520 --> 13:33.921
- Are you okay?
<i>- Yeah, of course I am.</i>

13:34.120 --> 13:35.849
Totally cool. No problem at all.

13:36.040 --> 13:38.042
<i>Okay. I'll see you tomorrow, then.</i>

13:38.200 --> 13:39.486
Okay.

13:39.640 --> 13:40.846
And don't forget the bike key.

13:41.000 --> 13:42.286
<i>I won't. I got it.</i>

13:42.440 --> 13:43.487
Bye, Dad. I love you.

13:43.640 --> 13:44.846
<i>I love you, too, honey.</i>

13:45.000 --> 13:46.047
<i>Bye.</i>

14:38.480 --> 14:40.687
<i>Come here, you guys.
Let's take a picture.</i>

14:40.840 --> 14:42.444
<i>Come on, Dad!</i>

15:31.040 --> 15:32.246
<i>Lawrence, it's incredible.</i>

15:32.520 --> 15:34.522
This is the third mini quake
since we've been here.

15:34.680 --> 15:37.286
And the magnetic pulse rate
has increased before each one of them.

15:37.440 --> 15:38.930
<i>We got a pattern, my friend.</i>

15:39.120 --> 15:40.770
That was a 2.2.

15:40.960 --> 15:42.724
Our model's predictive.

15:43.120 --> 15:44.929
We got it right, man! Finally!

15:45.080 --> 15:47.082
Yep, we sure did. Ha, ha.

15:50.520 --> 15:51.646
Oh, shit.

15:53.200 --> 15:54.201
What's wrong?

15:54.360 --> 15:56.362
Pulse rates are spiking again.
They're huge.

15:56.520 --> 15:57.601
<i>Are you serious?</i>

16:00.040 --> 16:01.405
<i>Kim?</i>

16:01.600 --> 16:03.329
We're about to have a major quake.

16:09.560 --> 16:11.050
It jumped to a 7.1!

16:11.880 --> 16:12.881
<i>Jesus, Kim!</i>

16:13.040 --> 16:14.644
Get the hell outta there!

16:20.920 --> 16:22.809
Everybody get off the dam!

16:23.000 --> 16:25.480
Move! Now! Now!

16:34.680 --> 16:36.364
Everybody off! Hurry up!

16:37.160 --> 16:38.844
Stay behind the barriers!

17:07.800 --> 17:08.847
Come on, move!

17:09.000 --> 17:10.729
Stay behind the barriers!

17:16.839 --> 17:17.965
Kim! Hurry!

17:22.319 --> 17:23.924
Come here! I got you.

17:30.160 --> 17:32.891
Oh, my God! Please! Oh, my God!

17:37.240 --> 17:38.765
Kim! Hurry up!

17:42.400 --> 17:43.447
Lawrence!

18:00.280 --> 18:01.930
- Kim!
- No! No!

18:05.960 --> 18:07.007
Close your eyes.

18:11.240 --> 18:12.446
Oh, God!

18:32.920 --> 18:34.126
Are you okay?

19:00.520 --> 19:02.329
<i>The southern part of Nevada...</i>

19:02.480 --> 19:04.847
<i>...was rocked today
by what seismologists are calling...</i>

19:05.000 --> 19:08.083
<i>...the most destructive earthquake
ever recorded in that area.</i>

19:08.240 --> 19:11.050
<i>Officials are saying that Hoover Dam
is a total loss.</i>

19:11.200 --> 19:16.240
<i>Lake Havasu City, Needles, Blythe
and Laughlin also suffered major damage.</i>

19:16.400 --> 19:19.768
<i>Additional support from Los Angeles,
including L.A.F.D. air rescue...</i>

19:19.920 --> 19:22.730
<i>...is expected to begin arriving
in the next 24 hours.</i>

19:26.800 --> 19:27.801
Hi, Dad.

19:27.960 --> 19:29.962
- Hey, honey.
- We just saw the news.

19:30.480 --> 19:33.245
I know. I'm so sorry.
We're heading out tomorrow.

19:33.440 --> 19:35.681
No, I get it. This one's really bad, Dad.

19:35.840 --> 19:37.205
Yeah, this one's tough.

19:37.400 --> 19:40.847
<i>Earthquakes can rise and fall
in intensity during their duration...</i>

19:41.000 --> 19:43.207
- Hey, Em.
- Hey.

19:44.760 --> 19:46.205
- Good to see you.
- You, too.

19:46.440 --> 19:47.965
Ah, Daniel.

19:48.160 --> 19:49.810
Ray. Good to finally meet you.

19:50.000 --> 19:52.440
It's good to meet you, too.
Heck of a place you got here, man.

19:52.560 --> 19:54.210
- Thank you.
- Welcome.

19:54.360 --> 19:56.761
So, Dad is heading to Nevada tomorrow.

19:56.960 --> 19:59.884
Oh, it's terrible what happened.
Please be safe over there, okay?

20:00.040 --> 20:02.805
Yeah, we will. And I promise
I'm gonna make it up to you, honey.

20:02.960 --> 20:04.405
Dad, it's really no problem.

20:04.560 --> 20:06.050
The drive is not that bad.

20:06.200 --> 20:08.487
Wait, why don't I take you up there.

20:08.680 --> 20:11.650
I'm flying to San Francisco.
We can head to Seattle right after.

20:11.800 --> 20:14.121
Give me an opportunity to catch
a volleyball game.

20:14.280 --> 20:15.645
That's a good idea.

20:15.800 --> 20:19.486
And it'll give your mom a chance to get all
her stuff moved in without me in the way.

20:19.640 --> 20:20.687
Right.

20:22.320 --> 20:23.810
You guys moving in?

20:25.040 --> 20:28.362
Yeah. I was meaning to tell you,
but we haven't had a chance to...

20:30.640 --> 20:32.608
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

20:33.080 --> 20:34.366
Thanks.

20:35.520 --> 20:36.681
That's great.

20:39.840 --> 20:41.046
Call me when you get there.

20:41.200 --> 20:42.486
- I will.
- All right.

20:42.640 --> 20:43.926
I love you, Dad.

20:44.080 --> 20:45.206
You be careful, please.

20:45.360 --> 20:47.089
I will, I will. I love you, too.

20:51.120 --> 20:52.281
I'll get her bike.

20:52.480 --> 20:54.562
I'm sorry you guys
can't go up there together.

20:54.720 --> 20:55.960
Yep. Me, too.

20:56.600 --> 20:57.647
Ray.

20:58.400 --> 20:59.447
Ray.

21:01.160 --> 21:02.366
I was gonna tell you.

21:02.520 --> 21:04.284
We just decided to do it.

21:09.960 --> 21:11.371
Don't worry about it.

21:13.280 --> 21:14.281
Hey, if you want...

21:14.440 --> 21:16.408
I'll get those papers signed for you, too.

21:39.040 --> 21:40.849
<i>It was a Sunday afternoon.</i>

21:41.000 --> 21:44.766
<i>Obviously, people weren't at work.
They weren't asleep.</i>

21:44.920 --> 21:46.809
<i>Even so, we know the devastation
was fairly...</i>

21:46.960 --> 21:48.928
- This is bad.
- Yeah.

21:50.560 --> 21:51.800
What time we heading out?

21:51.960 --> 21:54.531
14:30. Guys are prepping the gear now.

21:54.680 --> 21:56.205
All right. Let's get to work.

21:56.360 --> 21:59.443
<i>--it's a fairly sophisticated
rescue operation underway.</i>

21:59.960 --> 22:02.281
So this Daniel guy's taking Blake now?

22:02.520 --> 22:04.363
I would have just called in sick.

22:04.800 --> 22:06.962
It's why I'm the boss and you're not.

22:07.120 --> 22:09.691
Pretty sure we can manage
a few days without ya.

22:09.840 --> 22:10.966
Shoe's untied.

22:12.760 --> 22:14.330
Are you kidding me?

22:25.720 --> 22:27.085
Blake.

22:31.160 --> 22:35.085
I want you to know that I respect
what you and your dad have.

22:35.640 --> 22:40.123
And I know that your mom moving in
has to feel like a pretty big step.

22:40.280 --> 22:43.170
But I'm never gonna try to change
what you have with him...

22:43.320 --> 22:45.004
...or take his place.

22:45.160 --> 22:46.400
Okay?

22:46.680 --> 22:47.841
Yeah.

22:48.520 --> 22:50.124
Okay, cool.

22:53.320 --> 22:55.243
Hey, how come you never had kids?

22:55.760 --> 22:58.525
Oh, I did.
This is one of them right here.

22:59.360 --> 23:02.523
She's a nice addition to
the San Francisco skyline, don't you think?

23:02.680 --> 23:03.681
"The Gate."

23:03.840 --> 23:05.001
Catchy. right?

23:05.720 --> 23:06.960
Yeah, I like it.

23:07.960 --> 23:11.487
Mom was telling me about this. She said
it's the tallest building in the city, right?

23:11.640 --> 23:14.564
When it's finished,
it'll be the tallest, strongest...

23:14.720 --> 23:16.324
...and it's already 80 percent sold.

23:17.240 --> 23:18.651
But honestly...

23:19.640 --> 23:23.565
...I guess I never had any kids
because I was always so busy raising these.

23:30.440 --> 23:32.841
Mom texted. She's having lunch
with your sister today.

23:33.000 --> 23:36.482
Yeah, she's only in town for a few days
and really wanted to meet her.

23:37.160 --> 23:40.209
I'm a little nervous though.
Susan can be kind of overprotective.

23:41.760 --> 23:42.807
Thank you.

24:21.400 --> 24:22.731
Jonathan.

24:23.200 --> 24:25.009
- Good morning, Mr. Riddick.
- Morning.

24:25.160 --> 24:26.161
Gonna be okay, Blake?

24:26.360 --> 24:27.521
Yeah, I'll be fine.

24:36.520 --> 24:37.567
Hi.

24:38.000 --> 24:39.365
Hello.

24:54.360 --> 24:55.725
I'm sorry, Lawrence.

24:55.880 --> 24:58.486
- Can I get you anything?
- No. I'm fine, Alexi. Thank you.

24:59.400 --> 25:00.765
Are you sure you want to be here?

25:01.000 --> 25:03.162
I can use the distraction, actually.

25:03.320 --> 25:04.845
Yeah?

25:05.000 --> 25:06.240
There's a reporter outside.

25:06.720 --> 25:09.246
Says she's doing a segment
on what happened in Nevada.

25:12.680 --> 25:14.762
I'm gonna tell her
that it's not a good time.

25:15.720 --> 25:17.449
No, wait a minute.

25:17.600 --> 25:19.682
Kim gave his life for this.

25:19.840 --> 25:22.764
People need to know
that we can predict these things now.

25:28.080 --> 25:31.482
You want a copy?
I got about a thousand in storage.

25:31.640 --> 25:34.246
No one listens to us
until the ground shakes, I guess.

25:34.400 --> 25:36.289
They told me
what happened to your colleague.

25:37.000 --> 25:38.445
We don't have to do this now.

25:39.440 --> 25:40.885
Yeah, we do.

25:41.080 --> 25:42.286
We're good to go.

25:43.280 --> 25:44.611
Okay.

25:44.760 --> 25:45.966
Rolling.

25:46.440 --> 25:48.124
First question:

25:48.280 --> 25:50.806
How come no one saw what happened
in Nevada coming?

25:50.960 --> 25:53.486
Because we didn't know
there were any fault lines out there.

25:53.640 --> 25:54.641
Why not?

25:54.800 --> 25:55.961
Heh.

25:56.120 --> 25:59.283
Contrary to popular belief,
scientists don't know everything.

25:59.440 --> 26:01.283
I understand that you publicly stated...

26:01.440 --> 26:04.569
...that, someday, scientists
will be able to predict earthquakes.

26:04.720 --> 26:08.441
Well, actually, as of yesterday,
we now believe that we can predict them.

26:08.600 --> 26:09.647
Professor!

26:13.000 --> 26:14.047
Talk to you a sec?

26:14.200 --> 26:15.929
Yeah. I'm sorry. Excuse me.

26:17.360 --> 26:18.521
What is it?

26:18.760 --> 26:22.401
Current pulse rates at our monitoring
stations. All along the San Andreas fault.

26:22.600 --> 26:24.728
Their averages are spiking
from 82 to 85...

26:24.880 --> 26:27.611
...with the biggest jumps
coming from San Francisco.

26:27.760 --> 26:29.888
More than 20 points higher
than what we saw in Nevada.

26:30.040 --> 26:31.041
There's no way.

26:31.200 --> 26:32.611
We checked. We double-checked.

26:32.760 --> 26:36.287
Then we reset all the instruments
and triple-checked. Those are the counts.

26:37.360 --> 26:39.966
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

26:40.520 --> 26:42.010
Um...

26:42.200 --> 26:44.487
Okay, uh...

26:46.000 --> 26:47.286
If, uh...

26:48.200 --> 26:50.441
If we draw a line...

26:50.840 --> 26:54.447
...from the bottom of the San Andreas
up to the Hoover Dam...

26:54.600 --> 26:57.968
...it almost literally follows
the Colorado River...

26:59.120 --> 27:01.361
...which is a natural deformation event.

27:01.520 --> 27:02.965
And geologically...

27:03.280 --> 27:06.966
...deformation events mark boundaries.

27:08.560 --> 27:10.289
They mark boundaries.

27:12.120 --> 27:13.406
So, what if...?

27:14.760 --> 27:16.922
What if this...

27:17.080 --> 27:20.209
...whole chunk of land
is connected to our tectonic plate?

27:20.360 --> 27:23.762
That would tell us that what happened
yesterday in Nevada was not an anomaly.

27:26.400 --> 27:27.401
No.

27:27.560 --> 27:30.370
What if it was a precursor movement...

27:30.680 --> 27:33.923
...along the leading edge
of the plate boundary fault...

27:34.080 --> 27:37.368
...from Los Angeles
all the way up to San Francisco?

27:37.520 --> 27:40.729
Are you saying you think
the whole San Andreas fault might go off?

27:41.400 --> 27:43.129
Yes, that's exactly what I'm saying.

27:45.080 --> 27:46.445
Who should we call?

27:48.400 --> 27:49.845
Everybody.

27:55.040 --> 27:56.087
Mm.

27:56.240 --> 27:57.571
Oh, bloody hell.

27:57.720 --> 27:59.449
I have something. Here.

28:01.000 --> 28:02.047
I'm a complete idiot.

28:02.360 --> 28:03.407
No.

28:04.240 --> 28:06.288
Thank you very much. That's very kind.

28:06.440 --> 28:07.680
Yeah, no problem.

28:09.560 --> 28:10.846
I'm Blake, by the way.

28:11.040 --> 28:13.361
Oh, yeah. I'm Blake. I'm not Blake!

28:13.520 --> 28:17.366
I'm Ben. Ben Taylor is my name.
Pleased to meet you.

28:17.520 --> 28:18.521
It's nice to meet you.

28:18.680 --> 28:20.444
So was that your father
you came in with?

28:21.000 --> 28:22.081
Daniel Riddick?

28:22.640 --> 28:24.369
Um, he's my mom's boyfriend.

28:24.520 --> 28:26.841
- Ah.
- Are you meeting with him?

28:27.000 --> 28:28.445
Oh, no. I...

28:28.640 --> 28:30.608
Pfft. Not even close.

28:30.760 --> 28:31.761
I wish.

28:31.920 --> 28:33.809
I'm interviewing for a job here...

28:33.960 --> 28:37.043
...and Mr. Riddick
is the boss of the boss...

28:37.200 --> 28:40.044
- ...of the boss that I'd be working for.
- Heh.

28:40.280 --> 28:42.601
So, what kind of job
are you interviewing for?

28:42.840 --> 28:46.686
Anything in engineering or design.
I'm not picky or proud.

28:46.840 --> 28:48.205
I just want to work here.

28:48.360 --> 28:51.603
If you're an architect,
this is the place to be.

28:53.720 --> 28:56.451
Hi. I'm Ollie. He's my brother.

28:57.840 --> 28:59.808
Hi. It's nice to meet you, Ollie.
I'm Blake.

28:59.960 --> 29:01.485
You know, you're quite beautiful.

29:02.240 --> 29:04.322
- Why, thank you.
- Ollie. Do you...?

29:04.840 --> 29:05.841
Sorry.

29:06.000 --> 29:07.650
Do you remember what we discussed?

29:08.200 --> 29:09.804
Sit still and no talking.

29:09.960 --> 29:12.930
It's not normal to bring little brothers
to job interviews.

29:13.080 --> 29:15.003
And let's not embarrass me, okay?

29:17.080 --> 29:19.481
Do you mind if I get your phone number
for him?

29:19.640 --> 29:20.641
Ollie!

29:20.800 --> 29:22.086
- It's exactly...
- What?

29:22.280 --> 29:26.365
You'll never ask for it. And then I'll have to
listen to how much you regretted not getting it.

29:26.520 --> 29:28.443
- Heh.
- Mr. Taylor?

29:29.560 --> 29:31.562
- Ms. Carter will see you now.
- Thank you.

29:34.160 --> 29:35.844
I, uh...

29:36.840 --> 29:37.921
Good luck.

29:39.400 --> 29:43.200
Thank you. And, you, sit here
and don't say another word.

29:47.360 --> 29:48.691
- Hi. I'm Ben.
- Hello.

29:48.840 --> 29:51.571
- We're gonna head straight over.
- Excellent.

29:53.040 --> 29:54.280
What do you want to talk about?

29:56.520 --> 29:57.851
Um...

29:58.000 --> 29:59.445
- Where you from?
- England.

29:59.600 --> 30:01.881
Ben thought while our parents
were gonna be on a cruise...

30:02.000 --> 30:04.844
...he and I should take a holiday here
in the city, after his interview.

30:05.000 --> 30:07.367
- Awesome.
- Oh.

30:07.560 --> 30:09.608
Would you like to hear our itinerary?

30:23.840 --> 30:26.810
Susan. It's nice to finally meet you.

30:26.960 --> 30:28.200
You as well.

30:28.960 --> 30:32.965
Now that Daniel's asked you to move in
with him, things must be pretty serious.

30:33.600 --> 30:34.647
Yes.

30:34.840 --> 30:37.571
Hi. I'm Larissa.
I'll be taking care of you today.

30:37.720 --> 30:39.080
Can I tell you about our specials?

30:39.200 --> 30:40.280
Please, I'd love to hear...

30:40.400 --> 30:43.165
Actually, could you come back
in a few minutes, Larissa?

30:44.160 --> 30:45.810
Yeah. Sure.

30:48.440 --> 30:51.649
So, I understand
you've been married before?

30:52.280 --> 30:53.441
Yes.

30:53.800 --> 30:56.087
- And you have just the one daughter. Right?
- Right.

30:57.520 --> 31:00.000
Your other one drowned in an accident?

31:01.320 --> 31:03.163
Yes, to put it bluntly.

31:03.320 --> 31:04.924
Oh, I didn't mean it like that.

31:06.240 --> 31:07.651
Can you just give me one minute?

31:11.200 --> 31:12.770
Hi. Everything okay?

31:13.120 --> 31:15.168
<i>Yeah. Uh...</i>

31:15.320 --> 31:18.130
<i>Oh, I'm on my way to maintenance
before we head out and...</i>

31:18.760 --> 31:19.921
Am I interrupting anything?

31:20.960 --> 31:23.281
Nothing important. What's going on?

31:23.480 --> 31:27.371
Look, I just wanted to tell you
I was sorry for how I acted yesterday.

31:27.720 --> 31:28.801
No, Ray, really.

31:28.960 --> 31:30.007
<i>No, Emma.</i>

31:30.600 --> 31:33.683
I just wasn't ready to hear about you
and Blake moving in with someone else.

31:35.080 --> 31:36.764
I should've told you before.

31:37.680 --> 31:39.967
- Hey, how's Blake feel about it?
<i>- You know.</i>

31:40.120 --> 31:42.088
She'd like us to be a family again.

31:42.240 --> 31:44.720
I think it's gonna be hard for her to...

31:53.200 --> 31:54.406
Emma.

31:54.600 --> 31:57.046
Oh, my God.
We're having an earthquake.

31:58.800 --> 32:01.041
<i>Oh, Jesus, Ray.
I gotta get outta here.</i>

32:01.200 --> 32:03.680
- Where are you?
- Aah! Um...

32:03.840 --> 32:04.887
The Tate Weston.

32:05.040 --> 32:07.202
<i>Shit, you're on the top floor.
Emma, listen:</i>

32:07.400 --> 32:09.323
Get as many people
as you can to the roof.

32:09.480 --> 32:12.051
<i>- I'm in the helo and I'll get you from there.</i>
- Okay, okay!

32:12.240 --> 32:13.685
Get to the roof, honey.

32:18.880 --> 32:20.769
No, no, no!

32:20.920 --> 32:22.410
Under the table.

32:22.600 --> 32:24.409
Drop, cover and hold on!

32:29.240 --> 32:32.483
Lawrence, the Richter just jumped
from a 6.5 to an 8.5.

32:32.640 --> 32:33.846
What does that mean?

32:34.000 --> 32:35.206
Powers of ten!

32:35.360 --> 32:37.601
So it's a hundred times stronger now!

32:37.760 --> 32:40.889
Don't worry. Caltech is probably
the safest place to be right now.

32:41.040 --> 32:44.840
Professor! It looks like the whole
San Andreas fault line is being activated.

32:45.720 --> 32:48.007
And it's heading toward San Francisco.

32:49.440 --> 32:50.726
All right. All done.

32:51.920 --> 32:53.001
Okay.

32:54.960 --> 32:59.010
Well, it was really nice to meet you, Ollie.
I hope you have fun while you're here.

32:59.200 --> 33:01.248
Bye, Blake. It was nice meeting you,
as well.

33:01.400 --> 33:02.481
Goodbye.

33:02.640 --> 33:04.324
Oh, and, um...

33:04.480 --> 33:08.041
I almost forgot. Do you mind if I
borrow your book for a second?

33:14.840 --> 33:16.808
Tell Ben that I'll put in a good word
for him.

33:20.720 --> 33:21.881
Heh.

33:22.920 --> 33:24.251
- Bye.
- Bye.

33:27.280 --> 33:29.442
I can't wait to be 20.

33:35.200 --> 33:37.043
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

33:54.560 --> 33:55.607
It's an earthquake!

33:56.680 --> 33:58.523
Well, go, go, go! Get us outta here!

34:05.400 --> 34:06.447
God.

34:09.040 --> 34:11.407
Go, man! Hurry, hurry!

34:13.960 --> 34:15.449
The exit! Go, go, go!

34:18.639 --> 34:19.687
Jesus Christ!

34:23.239 --> 34:24.480
Oh, shit! Go!

34:35.560 --> 34:36.925
My legs!

34:45.440 --> 34:46.679
You okay?

34:46.840 --> 34:49.525
Oh, my God. He's dead!

34:50.800 --> 34:51.847
Blake?

34:52.440 --> 34:54.329
- Blake? Blake.
- He's dead.

34:54.760 --> 34:55.806
Are you okay?

34:55.960 --> 34:57.166
Are you hurt?

34:57.400 --> 34:59.846
No, I don't think...

35:00.040 --> 35:01.451
I don't think so.

35:01.800 --> 35:02.926
But my legs are stuck.

35:05.640 --> 35:06.687
Please.

35:08.280 --> 35:10.248
Come on. Okay. Okay.

35:11.960 --> 35:14.406
We're gonna get you out of here. Okay?

35:25.680 --> 35:27.921
On, God. Okay.

35:28.080 --> 35:30.447
Think.

35:41.920 --> 35:42.967
Daniel?

35:45.280 --> 35:47.647
- Blake, I'm gonna go for help.
- No, Daniel...

35:47.800 --> 35:50.246
- I'll be right back. I'll be right back.
- No, Daniel. Don't.

35:50.400 --> 35:51.447
Don't leave me alone!

35:51.920 --> 35:52.967
Daniel!

35:53.480 --> 35:54.766
Daniel.

35:55.120 --> 35:56.929
Let's go! Keep moving!

35:57.080 --> 35:58.570
- Come on. Hurry!
- Help!

35:58.760 --> 35:59.886
- Let's go!
- Help!

36:00.040 --> 36:02.008
- Keep moving! Keep moving! Let's go!
- Help!

36:02.160 --> 36:03.764
There's a girl trapped in a town car!

36:03.920 --> 36:05.206
- Where?
- In the parking garage!

36:06.720 --> 36:07.767
Oh, God!

36:10.760 --> 36:12.091
Allen!

36:12.360 --> 36:13.407
Get up! Get up!

36:22.760 --> 36:25.001
Help me, somebody! Help me, please!

36:25.680 --> 36:28.126
Out the building! Get outside!

36:30.360 --> 36:31.805
Get out in the open! Hurry!

36:32.560 --> 36:33.846
Mr. Riddick!

36:34.360 --> 36:35.691
Mr. Riddick?

36:36.040 --> 36:37.166
I need air.

36:37.320 --> 36:38.481
Mr. Riddick!

36:40.280 --> 36:42.248
Help me!

36:45.520 --> 36:46.726
Move it!

36:46.920 --> 36:47.967
Blake.

37:13.840 --> 37:15.569
Oh, my God.

37:39.160 --> 37:40.605
- Susan!
- Emma!

37:40.760 --> 37:42.808
Susan! We gotta get to the roof!

37:43.160 --> 37:44.605
We've gotta get out of here!

37:44.760 --> 37:46.285
- This way!
- You can't...

37:46.440 --> 37:47.566
Get out of my way!

37:47.720 --> 37:49.290
Susan! Susan!

37:49.440 --> 37:51.568
Aah! Unh.

38:02.880 --> 38:06.089
Aah! Oh, my God.

38:13.640 --> 38:15.005
There's the exit!

38:15.480 --> 38:18.450
This way! Get over here!

38:23.080 --> 38:24.605
Ma'am! We gotta go!

38:24.760 --> 38:26.000
Okay. Okay.

38:27.400 --> 38:29.482
Come on! Keep moving! Keep moving!

38:30.320 --> 38:33.130
Larissa! Larissa,
you have to come with me!

38:33.280 --> 38:34.805
We've gotta get to the roof!

38:36.600 --> 38:39.490
Everybody!
There's a rescue helicopter coming!

38:39.640 --> 38:42.211
- No! Wait!
- Wait! We've gotta go up!

38:43.360 --> 38:46.284
- Oh, God!
- Oh, my God!

38:46.440 --> 38:47.566
Come on!

38:48.280 --> 38:50.009
This way! This way!

38:51.040 --> 38:52.166
Oh, my God.

38:53.600 --> 38:56.001
Ray, you better be right about this.

39:14.600 --> 39:16.329
Aah! Ugh!

40:28.320 --> 40:29.367
Ray.

40:41.880 --> 40:42.881
Phew.

40:52.040 --> 40:53.087
Oh, my God.

40:53.520 --> 40:55.409
Oh, my God. Uh...

40:58.960 --> 41:00.007
Up there!

41:33.560 --> 41:34.971
Aah!

41:35.120 --> 41:36.201
Ugh!

41:36.400 --> 41:37.925
Oh, shit.

41:45.000 --> 41:47.207
Come on, Emma. Come on. We gotta go.

42:10.960 --> 42:12.007
Emma, run!

42:26.040 --> 42:27.804
Aah!

42:32.160 --> 42:33.400
Emma.

42:50.080 --> 42:51.127
Ray!

42:53.720 --> 42:54.926
Ray!

42:55.600 --> 42:56.647
Emma!

42:57.280 --> 42:58.327
I got you!

43:00.280 --> 43:01.566
Ray.

43:02.720 --> 43:03.767
Emma, are you hurt?

43:04.640 --> 43:06.449
- Um...
- Are you hurt?

43:06.640 --> 43:07.926
I don't think so.

43:08.680 --> 43:11.160
Okay. It's gonna be okay, but listen.
We gotta get outta here.

43:11.320 --> 43:13.004
Get to the front left seat. I'll be there.

43:13.400 --> 43:14.925
- Okay
- Okay?

43:32.280 --> 43:33.327
Shit!

43:40.880 --> 43:42.325
Oh, my God.

43:44.320 --> 43:45.367
Get up!

43:45.560 --> 43:46.607
Oh, God.

43:53.440 --> 43:54.726
- Ray!
- Hold on!

44:37.360 --> 44:38.646
Help!

44:38.800 --> 44:40.643
Somebody help me!

44:41.560 --> 44:43.881
Help! Somebody help!

45:17.160 --> 45:18.207
This is Ray.

45:18.520 --> 45:20.602
<i>- Dad, please help!</i>
- Blake, what's wrong?

45:22.480 --> 45:24.323
<i>There's been a huge earthquake!</i>

45:24.480 --> 45:28.041
I don't know where Daniel went.
I'm stuck in a limo in a garage in the dark.

45:28.240 --> 45:30.447
<i>I'm really, really scared, Dad!</i>

45:30.600 --> 45:31.806
Baby, are you hurt?

45:31.960 --> 45:33.086
<i>No, but my leg is...</i>

45:33.400 --> 45:34.811
Blake! Goddamn it.

45:35.000 --> 45:36.161
What? What is it?

45:36.320 --> 45:37.321
Shit.

45:37.480 --> 45:39.130
Her cell service just went out.

45:39.960 --> 45:43.567
There's no way rescue personnel are
gonna be digging in garages any time soon.

45:43.760 --> 45:46.206
There's too many populated places
above ground.

45:46.360 --> 45:47.566
What, uh...?

45:47.760 --> 45:49.046
What are we gonna do?

45:54.320 --> 45:56.084
We're going to get our daughter.

46:22.800 --> 46:24.131
Blake!

46:24.560 --> 46:27.166
- Blake!
- Help! I'm over here!

46:27.680 --> 46:30.411
Blake! Blake, it's Ben. Are you okay?

46:30.600 --> 46:33.444
I can't get out. The roof's collapsing.
My legs are trapped.

46:33.640 --> 46:35.688
Okay. Okay.

46:37.040 --> 46:40.442
All right, Ollie, we need to lift this beam
to get the pressure off her legs.

46:40.600 --> 46:41.965
- Okay?
- Yeah.

46:42.440 --> 46:43.851
Oh, let's try this.

46:44.480 --> 46:45.527
Okay, ready?

46:45.920 --> 46:48.002
Ready? One, two, three.

46:50.640 --> 46:53.120
Come on, Ollie.
Give it everything you've got.

46:53.840 --> 46:55.285
I am!

46:55.440 --> 46:56.805
It's not working!

47:04.000 --> 47:05.047
Ollie!

47:15.040 --> 47:16.280
Ben?

47:16.640 --> 47:17.880
- Ollie?
- We're still here.

47:18.600 --> 47:20.045
We're still here.

47:26.320 --> 47:27.401
Oh, no.

47:27.560 --> 47:28.641
No.

47:28.800 --> 47:29.926
You have to get out of here.

47:30.560 --> 47:32.528
This building's gonna collapse.

47:38.200 --> 47:40.806
There's not a chance in hell
we're leaving you in there.

47:49.160 --> 47:51.083
Okay. Okay.

47:53.720 --> 47:54.881
All right.

47:56.000 --> 47:57.365
Here we go.

47:58.320 --> 47:59.401
Okay.

48:07.120 --> 48:09.168
Brilliant. It's working!

48:12.760 --> 48:13.921
All right.

48:16.400 --> 48:17.526
It won't go any higher.

48:17.680 --> 48:19.205
I'm still stuck!

48:35.480 --> 48:36.970
- Ollie!
- She's moving!

48:40.160 --> 48:41.491
Hurry, hurry. Hurry!

48:41.640 --> 48:42.687
Got you!

48:52.120 --> 48:53.610
Are you okay?

48:57.920 --> 48:59.126
Yeah.

48:59.560 --> 49:01.289
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

49:03.200 --> 49:05.282
Thank you. Thank you, guys.

49:05.440 --> 49:06.601
Pleasure.

49:07.200 --> 49:08.247
Good job.

49:10.680 --> 49:12.091
Come on. It's another aftershock.

49:12.240 --> 49:13.810
We've got to get out of here.

49:16.880 --> 49:18.723
- Look out!
- Move, move, move! Hurry!

49:18.880 --> 49:22.089
Come on! Come on! We have to
get away from these buildings.

49:23.040 --> 49:24.087
Blake!

49:24.240 --> 49:25.765
- Oh, my God.
- Blake! This way!

49:25.920 --> 49:26.967
This way!

49:30.240 --> 49:31.287
Jesus!

49:31.440 --> 49:32.805
- Oh, my God!
- Ollie!

49:33.440 --> 49:34.566
Blake!

49:36.440 --> 49:37.487
Come on!

49:40.200 --> 49:41.281
Come on!

49:41.440 --> 49:43.090
Go, go, go!

49:43.680 --> 49:45.444
All right, this way.

49:51.400 --> 49:53.767
I cannot believe that Daniel
just took off.

49:54.760 --> 49:56.000
What an asshole.

49:57.000 --> 49:58.331
<i>Step aside.</i>

50:01.560 --> 50:04.080
I gotta get ahold of my parents.
I gotta let them know I'm okay.

50:04.480 --> 50:06.881
Cell phones aren't working. I've tried.

50:08.560 --> 50:10.289
We need to find an electronics store.

50:11.840 --> 50:13.922
Does that book of yours list businesses?

50:15.480 --> 50:17.403
My book has everything.

50:19.040 --> 50:22.442
The good news is most of
our emergency systems are still working.

50:22.600 --> 50:25.649
We've got signals coming in
from 17 monitors.

50:28.400 --> 50:30.482
We just experienced a 9.1.

50:34.200 --> 50:36.601
Lawrence. You need to see this.

50:37.840 --> 50:39.205
What do we got?

50:41.680 --> 50:43.682
Here are the pulse rates
before the quake.

50:44.880 --> 50:45.927
Yeah, okay.

50:46.080 --> 50:47.684
And here are the pulse rates now.

50:49.520 --> 50:51.443
The same. Or higher.

50:51.640 --> 50:53.449
So the earthquake didn't diminish them.

50:53.760 --> 50:55.364
Oh, man.

50:56.760 --> 50:59.081
Oh, this is not good.

50:59.280 --> 51:03.524
Alexi, I want all the data from every monitoring
station still up along the fault line.

51:03.680 --> 51:05.444
- And get it for me now.
- Right.

51:05.600 --> 51:07.568
- What's going on?
- This is not over.

51:07.720 --> 51:08.767
Shit.

51:09.360 --> 51:11.931
Oh, man. This thing's fried.

51:13.680 --> 51:15.250
Come on. I need everybody.

51:15.400 --> 51:18.324
- What are we doing?
- Getting you on the air. To warn people.

51:18.480 --> 51:20.608
- How? There's no way to upload a signal.
- Oh.

51:20.800 --> 51:21.961
You're at Caltech.

51:32.920 --> 51:36.049
Okay, who wants an "A" in independent
study? I'm starting a new class:

51:36.200 --> 51:38.601
"How to Save Lives
by Hacking Media Outlets."

51:40.480 --> 51:42.244
Hell, yeah, man. I'm in.

51:42.400 --> 51:43.811
Sweet. Get your laptop. Let's go.

51:46.920 --> 51:48.888
Right here. Move, move, move.

51:49.080 --> 51:50.605
Here we go. Up. Lift.

51:51.360 --> 51:53.044
Let's go! Over here.

51:53.320 --> 51:55.209
It should be just up ahead.

51:56.600 --> 51:57.840
There it is.

52:08.240 --> 52:11.050
Okay, anything running on electricity
isn't gonna work...

52:11.200 --> 52:14.249
...so we have to find
a rotary or a push-button phone.

52:14.440 --> 52:15.930
How do you know all this?

52:16.080 --> 52:17.411
My dad.

52:17.720 --> 52:19.961
He works for L.A. Fire and Rescue.

52:23.240 --> 52:24.651
Over here.

52:26.120 --> 52:28.361
Great. I'll look for a landline.

52:43.040 --> 52:44.087
I got one!

52:50.840 --> 52:51.887
Blake?

52:52.400 --> 52:53.606
Dad.

52:53.760 --> 52:55.250
Dad. I got out. I'm okay.

52:55.440 --> 52:57.044
Aah. She's okay.

52:57.440 --> 52:59.010
Oh.

52:59.160 --> 53:00.321
Let me talk to her.

53:02.240 --> 53:03.401
Blake?

53:03.760 --> 53:04.807
Mom?

53:04.960 --> 53:06.724
Oh, thank God, honey.

53:07.600 --> 53:08.965
Is Daniel okay?

53:11.560 --> 53:12.971
<i>He left me, Mom.</i>

53:13.120 --> 53:14.281
He what?

53:14.680 --> 53:17.251
<i>He told a security guard where I was...</i>

53:17.400 --> 53:19.050
<i>...and then he just took off...</i>

53:19.200 --> 53:22.647
...and these two brothers that I met
overheard him and they came to help me.

53:22.880 --> 53:24.086
I'm with them right now.

53:24.600 --> 53:25.681
He left her?

53:26.400 --> 53:28.209
We're coming to get you, honey.
Where are you?

53:28.480 --> 53:32.769
I'm in an electronics store in Chinatown.

53:32.920 --> 53:35.207
Honey, it's gonna be okay,
but I need you to listen to me.

53:35.360 --> 53:37.886
Getting outta there is gonna be
a complete gridlock nightmare.

53:38.040 --> 53:40.202
So get to higher ground. It's safer.

53:40.400 --> 53:42.164
<i>That's where I'm gonna
be able to see you.</i>

53:42.360 --> 53:44.761
Do you remember where we spent
Mallory's birthday weekend?

53:44.920 --> 53:47.651
- At Coit Tower?
<i>- Yeah. Yeah.</i>

53:47.800 --> 53:49.960
- That tall cement nozzle thing on the hill.
<i>- Exactly.</i>

53:50.000 --> 53:52.480
Don't stop anywhere. Go there.
That's where we'll meet.

53:52.840 --> 53:54.524
Stay strong, honey.

53:54.680 --> 53:56.364
- We're coming to get you.
<i>- Okay.</i>

53:57.440 --> 54:00.284
Wait, Mom.
How are you and Dad together?

54:03.320 --> 54:05.243
We'll explain later. Okay, honey?
I love you.

54:05.400 --> 54:06.925
I love you guys.

54:07.440 --> 54:08.487
Bye.

54:21.960 --> 54:25.362
<i>Hi, you've reached Daniel. Please
leave me a message and I'll get back to you.</i>

54:25.920 --> 54:27.524
You left my daughter?

54:27.720 --> 54:30.644
If you're not already dead,
I'm gonna fucking kill you.

54:32.640 --> 54:33.846
Thattagirl.

54:39.280 --> 54:40.884
All right. We need to get going.

54:41.040 --> 54:42.804
So how is your dad going to pick us up?

54:42.960 --> 54:44.530
He's on his way in a helicopter.

54:44.680 --> 54:46.170
That's so cool.

54:46.920 --> 54:49.526
I need you to look up Coit Tower
on your map.

54:54.240 --> 54:55.287
It's your turn.

54:55.600 --> 54:56.965
Your parents will be worried sick.

54:58.080 --> 54:59.286
Thank you.

55:05.400 --> 55:06.447
Don't run.

55:06.600 --> 55:07.840
Get in the street.

55:12.600 --> 55:14.011
Where are we going?

55:14.200 --> 55:16.560
- Stay away from the buildings.
- He wasn't there.

55:20.480 --> 55:22.960
- Another aftershock!
- It's okay. It's all right.

55:28.960 --> 55:30.689
Run! Run!

55:36.520 --> 55:37.931
Get out of my way!

55:39.920 --> 55:42.446
Hey! That was my spot!

56:03.560 --> 56:06.325
You know, when you were
talking to Blake...

56:07.800 --> 56:11.521
...that was the first time I heard you
say Mallory's name since we lost her.

56:16.280 --> 56:19.329
Hey, did you know that Blake keeps
pictures from our San Francisco trip?

56:19.600 --> 56:21.125
Yeah, in her memory box.

56:24.920 --> 56:25.967
<i>It's ironic.</i>

56:26.880 --> 56:28.689
Us heading back up there.

56:29.640 --> 56:30.846
It was a fun trip.

56:41.840 --> 56:44.002
- Where are we?
- Bakersfield.

56:45.240 --> 56:46.287
Or what's left of it.

56:46.880 --> 56:49.406
We're just about 90 minutes
from San Francisco.

56:58.400 --> 56:59.526
Uh...

56:59.680 --> 57:00.761
Ray?

57:08.000 --> 57:09.490
Did you just turn off the engine?

57:09.640 --> 57:10.687
We got a gearbox failure.

57:11.000 --> 57:12.764
Must've been that hit we took in L.A.

57:12.920 --> 57:15.241
- I'm gonna have to autorotate down.
- Auto-what?

57:17.160 --> 57:18.366
We're gonna crash.

57:19.120 --> 57:21.487
- Right. Okay.
- Hold on.

57:22.720 --> 57:23.767
Here we go.

57:37.800 --> 57:39.404
Aah!

57:39.600 --> 57:40.647
Hold on!

57:44.720 --> 57:47.644
- Oh, my God!
- Almost there. Almost there.

57:48.200 --> 57:50.009
We're just gonna set her down
right here.

57:50.160 --> 57:51.207
Jesus!

57:58.520 --> 58:00.602
Oh, my God!

58:10.720 --> 58:13.007
We got fuel all over us.
We need to get outta here.

58:24.680 --> 58:25.761
Get off me!

58:27.160 --> 58:29.925
- Come on, we gotta go. Stay low. Stay low.
- Okay.

58:35.160 --> 58:38.482
It's okay. We just gotta keep moving.
Just gotta keep moving.

58:41.120 --> 58:42.884
- Give it to me.
- Stay here, man!

58:43.080 --> 58:44.730
No, it's mine!

58:50.760 --> 58:53.684
I got the last one here, Robin!

58:56.600 --> 58:58.364
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

59:00.920 --> 59:02.524
Get in, get in, get in, get in.

59:04.840 --> 59:06.490
Looks like it's been stolen.

59:06.640 --> 59:08.563
All right. Well, we'll steal it again.

59:15.960 --> 59:17.291
Ray.

59:17.440 --> 59:18.965
Easy.

59:19.120 --> 59:21.691
Back it up! Come on!

59:23.280 --> 59:24.360
I'll be needing that truck.

59:26.760 --> 59:28.125
Not today.

59:28.800 --> 59:29.961
Oh, my God.

59:44.680 --> 59:47.809
<i>The quake centered about 20
miles east of downtown Los Angeles.</i>

59:47.960 --> 59:51.646
<i>Cell towers are down.
Most of the city's electricity, down.</i>

59:51.800 --> 59:54.121
<i>Communication at a virtual standstill.</i>

59:54.280 --> 59:57.443
<i>The devastation to Southern California
is expected to be massive.</i>

59:57.600 --> 01:00:02.162
<i>In fact, the entire state will take a hit. We're
already getting reports of collapsed buildings...</i>

01:00:02.320 --> 01:00:03.367
We're in.

01:00:03.520 --> 01:00:04.521
- Yes!
- Mm.

01:00:04.680 --> 01:00:07.286
<i>...as far north
as San Francisco and the Bay Area.</i>

01:00:07.440 --> 01:00:09.681
<i>There have been
at least five aftershocks ranging...</i>

01:00:09.840 --> 01:00:11.285
Okay. Here we go.

01:00:11.440 --> 01:00:15.081
<i>Producers are telling us we have
our first live feed from Los Angeles.</i>

01:00:15.240 --> 01:00:19.006
<i>Serena Johnson is on the ground
at the seismology center at Caltech.</i>

01:00:19.160 --> 01:00:20.161
Hello, Chris.

01:00:20.320 --> 01:00:24.803
I'm here with Dr. Lawrence Hayes, Executive
Director for Earthquake Studies at Caltech.

01:00:25.200 --> 01:00:27.407
He and his research partner,
Dr. Kim Park...

01:00:27.720 --> 01:00:29.961
...have come up with a model
that predicts earthquakes.

01:00:30.240 --> 01:00:32.607
They knew L.A. was going to get hit.

01:00:32.760 --> 01:00:34.171
But nobody listened to them.

01:00:34.320 --> 01:00:35.924
It's time now to listen.

01:00:36.080 --> 01:00:37.411
- Go ahead, doctor.
- Okay.

01:00:37.560 --> 01:00:42.248
In seismology terms, what we're
experiencing is what we call a swarm event.

01:00:42.920 --> 01:00:46.288
Basically, California's entire
tectonic plate has shifted.

01:00:46.440 --> 01:00:50.604
The quake we experienced in Los Angeles
did damage all the way up in San Francisco.

01:00:50.760 --> 01:00:54.207
Yeah, but the earthquake that they felt
was from movement along the fault line...

01:00:54.360 --> 01:00:55.361
...in the Central Valley.

01:00:55.520 --> 01:00:57.727
Their end of the fault line
has not moved yet.

01:00:58.160 --> 01:01:01.562
More importantly, people need to know
that the shaking is not over.

01:01:01.760 --> 01:01:03.569
And it's not aftershocks I'm talking about.

01:01:04.040 --> 01:01:05.644
San Francisco will get hit again.

01:01:05.880 --> 01:01:07.803
And it's going to be a bigger monster
this time.

01:01:07.960 --> 01:01:11.089
Our models are predicting
a 9.5 or greater.

01:01:11.480 --> 01:01:15.246
It will be so big that, even though
it's happening here in California...

01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:19.530
...you will feel it on the East Coast.

01:01:22.600 --> 01:01:26.161
Now, I cannot emphasize this enough
to the people of San Francisco:

01:01:26.320 --> 01:01:28.891
You need to get out. And I mean now.

01:01:29.360 --> 01:01:33.160
And, if you can't, you need to find
any means possible...

01:01:33.360 --> 01:01:35.601
<i>...to drop, cover and hold on.</i>

01:01:35.760 --> 01:01:38.206
<i>Because your life is gonna depend on it.</i>

01:01:41.200 --> 01:01:42.770
<i>God be with you.</i>

01:01:49.240 --> 01:01:51.607
<i>Aftershocks continue to rock
the Los Angeles area.</i>

01:01:51.760 --> 01:01:55.481
You ever think about what our life
would be like if we hadn't lost Mallory?

01:01:58.400 --> 01:01:59.925
- Em, don't.
- I do.

01:02:00.680 --> 01:02:01.727
All the time.

01:02:01.920 --> 01:02:03.285
We moved on.

01:02:03.480 --> 01:02:04.891
No, we didn't move on.

01:02:05.520 --> 01:02:06.931
We stopped moving.

01:02:07.360 --> 01:02:08.964
You didn't lose her on your watch.

01:02:09.360 --> 01:02:11.488
- No. But I lost her.
- Can we not talk about this?

01:02:12.040 --> 01:02:13.246
You owe it to me.

01:02:13.800 --> 01:02:17.247
This! This is the most
I've gotten out of you since she died.

01:02:18.360 --> 01:02:19.725
I need to know, Ray.

01:02:21.400 --> 01:02:22.925
Was it me?

01:02:23.160 --> 01:02:24.446
What did I do?

01:02:24.920 --> 01:02:26.960
- I never blamed you.
- I don't wanna talk about it.

01:02:27.040 --> 01:02:28.166
It doesn't matter.

01:02:28.320 --> 01:02:30.607
She's gone. Now you're gone...

01:02:32.840 --> 01:02:33.887
What's the point?

01:02:36.840 --> 01:02:38.604
I guess the point is...

01:02:38.840 --> 01:02:41.844
...this is why I didn't stick around.

01:02:46.600 --> 01:02:48.568
Hey! Hey!

01:02:48.720 --> 01:02:51.644
- Look out! Watch out! You have to stop!
- Hey! Slow down! Hey!

01:02:54.320 --> 01:02:55.685
- Ray!
- Aah!

01:03:25.360 --> 01:03:26.441
What is this?

01:03:31.160 --> 01:03:33.242
The San Andreas fault.

01:03:45.480 --> 01:03:47.608
I told you
we should've gone the other way.

01:03:47.800 --> 01:03:49.564
Because you knew
this was gonna happen?

01:03:49.760 --> 01:03:50.921
Oh. You!

01:03:57.360 --> 01:03:59.647
- We owe you guys a huge thanks.
- Really.

01:03:59.800 --> 01:04:00.801
No need.

01:04:00.960 --> 01:04:03.088
We nearly made
the same mistake ourselves...

01:04:03.560 --> 01:04:05.847
...but busted an axle
when we went off the road.

01:04:06.040 --> 01:04:08.042
Thank goodness my eyes
are better than his.

01:04:08.240 --> 01:04:11.130
Heh. Do you know
if there's any way around this?

01:04:11.640 --> 01:04:12.766
Well...

01:04:13.760 --> 01:04:15.489
...the 198 might not be out.

01:04:15.640 --> 01:04:17.642
- Through the pass.
- How far is that?

01:04:18.040 --> 01:04:21.806
Oh, ya gotta backtrack,
maybe, 70 miles or so.

01:04:30.920 --> 01:04:32.320
Sir, if you don't mind me asking...

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:35.490
...where'd you get your hat?

01:04:37.080 --> 01:04:38.650
You guys really bailed us out.

01:04:38.800 --> 01:04:40.200
You sure we can't fly you anywhere?

01:04:40.320 --> 01:04:43.529
Yeah. Our son lives in the mountains.
There's no place to land.

01:04:44.720 --> 01:04:46.210
- Thanks for the wheels.
- You bet.

01:04:46.400 --> 01:04:47.447
Be safe.

01:04:47.720 --> 01:04:48.767
Bye.

01:05:03.360 --> 01:05:05.362
We should be fueled up
in a couple of minutes.

01:05:05.520 --> 01:05:06.885
Okay. Great.

01:05:15.520 --> 01:05:16.965
Everything okay?

01:05:19.480 --> 01:05:21.926
You asked me before if it was you.

01:05:23.160 --> 01:05:24.241
It wasn't.

01:05:29.040 --> 01:05:30.929
I knew you didn't blame me.

01:05:32.240 --> 01:05:35.687
I just didn't know how to deal
with Mallory's death.

01:05:47.040 --> 01:05:49.850
It was my idea
to take Mallory rafting that day.

01:05:51.400 --> 01:05:52.447
<i>Ray.</i>

01:05:53.320 --> 01:05:55.971
You can't blame yourself
for what happened.

01:05:59.080 --> 01:06:01.128
<i>It's just different when it's your own kid.</i>

01:06:01.400 --> 01:06:02.640
<i>I know.</i>

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.367
Sometimes I can't get that look she had
outta my head.

01:06:08.400 --> 01:06:10.528
The moment she realized...

01:06:12.360 --> 01:06:14.567
...that I wasn't gonna be able to save her.

01:06:17.040 --> 01:06:21.728
And then coming home every day
to you and Blake only made it harder.

01:06:26.600 --> 01:06:30.446
Because nothing was the way it used
to be. And the way it used to be was...

01:06:33.040 --> 01:06:34.087
It was perfect.

01:06:38.320 --> 01:06:40.243
I should've let you in.

01:06:44.320 --> 01:06:46.129
I just didn't know how.

01:06:48.080 --> 01:06:51.129
I'm so sorry for how things
ended with us, Em.

01:06:53.120 --> 01:06:54.690
I really am.

01:07:01.600 --> 01:07:03.284
If you couldn't save our daughter...

01:07:04.200 --> 01:07:05.884
...then nobody could have.

01:07:14.120 --> 01:07:16.282
I miss her so much.

01:07:18.720 --> 01:07:20.245
Me, too.

01:07:25.840 --> 01:07:27.922
Let's go get our daughter.

01:07:53.760 --> 01:07:56.969
Let's go! Keep it moving! Let's go!

01:07:57.320 --> 01:07:59.891
Come on. Let's go.
Follow the evacuation route.

01:08:00.040 --> 01:08:02.407
Just a few more blocks
to Lombard Avenue...

01:08:02.560 --> 01:08:04.528
...which leads to Coit Tower.

01:08:08.200 --> 01:08:12.125
Do you mind if I ask why you wear
two of the same necklaces?

01:08:13.240 --> 01:08:15.049
Um...

01:08:16.479 --> 01:08:18.528
One of them used to be my sister's.

01:08:19.720 --> 01:08:23.361
I started wearing it after she died.

01:08:23.840 --> 01:08:26.571
We had given them to each other
for Christmas the year before.

01:08:28.479 --> 01:08:30.720
- I'm so sorry. I didn't mean...
- No. It's okay.

01:08:30.880 --> 01:08:33.167
I'm not hiding them.

01:08:36.960 --> 01:08:39.167
Hey. Check it out.

01:08:39.399 --> 01:08:40.845
What are you doing?

01:08:41.040 --> 01:08:43.964
They should have a supply box.
It'll have stuff that we can use.

01:08:47.279 --> 01:08:48.691
Is this it?

01:08:50.279 --> 01:08:51.486
Yes!

01:08:52.319 --> 01:08:53.446
Oh, okay.

01:08:55.560 --> 01:08:56.765
Here we go.

01:08:57.399 --> 01:08:59.004
Every city has a tactical channel...

01:08:59.160 --> 01:09:00.844
...first responders use to communicate on.

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:02.809
We can listen in,
we can see what's going on.

01:09:02.960 --> 01:09:04.086
Okay.

01:09:04.680 --> 01:09:06.125
- Here. Take these.
- Yeah.

01:09:07.680 --> 01:09:09.205
- Take this.
- What's an MRE?

01:09:09.359 --> 01:09:10.770
Meals Ready-to-Eat.

01:09:10.920 --> 01:09:13.446
These things have a shelf life
of over three years.

01:09:13.600 --> 01:09:15.363
- Wow.
- They don't taste so good.

01:09:16.840 --> 01:09:18.046
Blake!

01:09:18.880 --> 01:09:22.407
I think we're going to have a problem with
that big nozzle thing you were talking about.

01:09:22.560 --> 01:09:23.720
What?

01:09:24.800 --> 01:09:25.846
What do you mean?

01:09:27.720 --> 01:09:29.085
Oh, my God.

01:09:35.880 --> 01:09:37.848
We have to go to Plan B.

01:09:38.600 --> 01:09:40.170
I didn't think we had one.

01:09:40.640 --> 01:09:42.005
We do now.

01:09:45.200 --> 01:09:48.720
We need to get to the next highest ground
so that we can signal my dad in the helicopter.

01:09:48.840 --> 01:09:49.841
That would be Nob Hill.

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.685
It's the highest point in the city.
It's the other way.

01:09:53.600 --> 01:09:55.568
- Okay. Come on!
- No.

01:09:55.720 --> 01:09:57.609
Blake, wait! Wait! Just...

01:09:58.360 --> 01:09:59.850
Just wait.

01:10:00.600 --> 01:10:02.682
Coming through. Move, move, move!

01:10:26.320 --> 01:10:28.402
Blake, we'd be the only ones
going that way.

01:10:28.560 --> 01:10:31.291
My dad said to get to higher ground,
so that's what we gotta do.

01:10:31.520 --> 01:10:32.567
But...

01:10:33.120 --> 01:10:34.326
What if he doesn't make it?

01:10:35.280 --> 01:10:38.727
Listen, I know that this sounds crazy.

01:10:38.920 --> 01:10:40.763
But you have to trust me that he will.

01:10:44.880 --> 01:10:46.564
I... I ca...

01:10:49.040 --> 01:10:50.087
Ben.

01:10:52.840 --> 01:10:55.730
Did you know about the push-button
phone working with the landline?

01:10:56.720 --> 01:10:58.324
The supply box?

01:10:58.840 --> 01:11:00.808
Tactical radio channels?

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.844
I really think we should stick with her.

01:11:15.040 --> 01:11:16.087
Okay.

01:11:17.080 --> 01:11:18.650
Looks like we're going to Nob Hill.

01:11:19.360 --> 01:11:20.521
Okay.

01:11:20.800 --> 01:11:22.006
Let's go.

01:11:29.040 --> 01:11:31.805
<i>The following message
is transmitted at the request...</i>

01:11:31.960 --> 01:11:34.042
<i>...of the California Emergency Management.</i>

01:11:34.200 --> 01:11:37.761
<i>Residents are encouraged
to evacuate immediately.</i>

01:11:37.920 --> 01:11:39.684
Looks like the whole city's evacuating.

01:11:39.840 --> 01:11:41.410
Em, we got a problem at the airport.

01:11:49.600 --> 01:11:50.761
Where are we gonna land?

01:11:50.920 --> 01:11:53.287
We can't. At least, not in the city.

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:18.286
Come with me.

01:12:20.560 --> 01:12:21.971
Uh...

01:12:22.120 --> 01:12:23.406
Okay.

01:12:26.840 --> 01:12:27.966
You gotta be kidding me.

01:12:29.160 --> 01:12:31.447
Em, we have no place
to set this plane down...

01:12:31.600 --> 01:12:34.285
...and we have to get as close
to Coit Tower as we possibly can.

01:12:34.440 --> 01:12:36.442
In three minutes,
we're gonna be over Embarcadero.

01:12:36.600 --> 01:12:37.681
And?

01:12:38.400 --> 01:12:41.688
And, we're gonna drop into AT&T Park.

01:12:41.840 --> 01:12:45.003
- But I don't know how to parachute.
- That's okay. We're gonna tandem-jump.

01:12:45.680 --> 01:12:47.205
I think we should stay with the plane.

01:12:47.480 --> 01:12:50.450
The plane's gonna nosedive in the Pacific
as soon as it runs out of gas.

01:12:50.600 --> 01:12:51.647
Okay.

01:12:52.600 --> 01:12:53.681
Hmm.

01:12:57.120 --> 01:12:58.610
Trust me.

01:13:02.680 --> 01:13:05.570
Oh, my God!

01:13:09.920 --> 01:13:10.967
You ready?

01:13:11.120 --> 01:13:12.963
Do I sound ready?

01:13:13.120 --> 01:13:14.201
Yep!

01:14:14.720 --> 01:14:17.291
It's been a while
since I got you to second base.

01:14:21.160 --> 01:14:25.165
<i>With a grave warning from Dr. Lawrence
Hayes blanketing the airwaves...</i>

01:14:25.320 --> 01:14:28.403
<i>...San Francisco has begun evacuation.</i>

01:14:28.560 --> 01:14:31.643
<i>The Coast Guard is asking anyone
with access to a boat to please volunteer.</i>

01:14:31.800 --> 01:14:33.400
<i>...the fault line in the Central Valley.</i>

01:14:33.520 --> 01:14:35.761
<i>Their end of the fault line
has not moved yet.</i>

01:14:35.920 --> 01:14:40.642
<i>San Francisco is going to get hit again,
and this will be a much bigger monster.</i>

01:14:41.880 --> 01:14:44.565
I hope we've given everyone
enough warning.

01:14:50.040 --> 01:14:51.371
This is it, isn't it?

01:14:51.600 --> 01:14:53.887
Right now, I wanna be so wrong.

01:14:54.040 --> 01:14:55.724
Everyone, take cover!

01:15:03.720 --> 01:15:05.848
This will be over soon here.

01:15:06.080 --> 01:15:08.560
But pray for the people
of San Francisco.

01:15:09.920 --> 01:15:12.526
Did you know "Nob" is a slang term...

01:15:12.680 --> 01:15:14.409
..."which means 'rich or wealthy.'

01:15:14.560 --> 01:15:19.327
It's a shortened version of the word 'nobility, '
because of the families that live there.

01:15:19.480 --> 01:15:22.563
It's also derisively known as 'Snob Hill."'

01:15:29.520 --> 01:15:30.760
What is it?

01:15:31.240 --> 01:15:32.605
Daniel built that building.

01:15:36.840 --> 01:15:37.841
Oh, my God!

01:15:41.640 --> 01:15:42.687
Oh, shit.

01:15:47.800 --> 01:15:49.848
Move! Move!

01:15:51.160 --> 01:15:52.241
Come on, Ollie!

01:15:53.840 --> 01:15:54.841
Ugh!

01:16:04.960 --> 01:16:06.246
Ollie!

01:16:06.560 --> 01:16:08.369
I want to go home now!

01:16:08.720 --> 01:16:09.721
Just hold on!

01:16:09.880 --> 01:16:12.360
It's gonna be okay. I promise!

01:16:48.720 --> 01:16:50.245
Head to the building!

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:57.570
They're gonna get killed out there.

01:16:57.720 --> 01:17:00.121
Em, get to the side of the stadium.
I'll be right there.

01:17:00.280 --> 01:17:01.361
I'll be right there!

01:17:01.520 --> 01:17:05.002
It's not safe here. Go to the side
of the stadium, right now!

01:17:05.160 --> 01:17:07.686
This building's gonna collapse.
You need to move!

01:17:08.400 --> 01:17:09.561
Come on. Go, go.

01:17:09.720 --> 01:17:11.529
Hurry! You gotta get off the street!

01:17:11.680 --> 01:17:15.241
Get to the side of the stadium!
Right now! Side of the stadium!

01:17:15.440 --> 01:17:18.523
Come on. Come on. Come on.
Off the street! Get to the stadium.

01:17:18.680 --> 01:17:21.365
Side of the stadium! Come on!
Get out of the street!

01:17:29.280 --> 01:17:30.441
Help!

01:17:30.600 --> 01:17:33.001
It's all right. Come on. I got you.
I got you. And up!

01:17:37.640 --> 01:17:38.846
Go.

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:40.365
Over here, Ray!

01:17:41.120 --> 01:17:42.880
- I got her! I got her.
- Here, take her, Em.

01:17:48.960 --> 01:17:51.930
You're gonna be okay.
You're gonna be okay. It's all right.

01:17:53.400 --> 01:17:54.481
Everybody down!

01:18:15.840 --> 01:18:17.729
- Everybody okay?
- We're good.

01:18:18.040 --> 01:18:19.451
Anybody hurt?

01:18:19.600 --> 01:18:20.647
No.

01:18:25.080 --> 01:18:26.127
Emma.

01:18:26.280 --> 01:18:27.406
You okay?

01:18:28.200 --> 01:18:29.247
Yeah.

01:18:33.680 --> 01:18:35.523
How'd you know we'd be safe'?

01:18:37.840 --> 01:18:40.366
Just get up against something sturdy.
Protect yourself.

01:18:41.040 --> 01:18:42.087
Triangle of life.

01:18:46.440 --> 01:18:47.487
Let's go.

01:19:21.720 --> 01:19:23.563
She's gonna be okay.

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.002
But how do we get through that?

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:38.126
We don't.

01:19:38.800 --> 01:19:40.211
We go around it.

01:19:47.280 --> 01:19:49.442
Ugh. Okay.

01:19:51.720 --> 01:19:52.801
Okay.

01:19:53.320 --> 01:19:54.685
We have to get that out of there.

01:19:54.960 --> 01:19:57.167
If you try walking with it,
it could cause more damage.

01:20:07.840 --> 01:20:09.251
This is gonna hurt.

01:20:09.400 --> 01:20:10.481
Are you ready?

01:20:13.960 --> 01:20:15.121
Okay.

01:20:25.640 --> 01:20:26.641
Ben!

01:20:28.520 --> 01:20:29.726
I'm all right.

01:20:30.360 --> 01:20:31.600
I'm all right.

01:20:33.080 --> 01:20:35.162
Do you think you could
put some weight on it?

01:20:35.320 --> 01:20:38.005
We have to keep moving.
We gotta get up that hill.

01:20:38.160 --> 01:20:39.241
Yeah.

01:20:39.400 --> 01:20:40.481
Okay.

01:20:40.800 --> 01:20:41.926
Here.

01:20:57.680 --> 01:20:59.125
<i>How bad did they get hit?</i>

01:21:04.320 --> 01:21:05.401
9.6.

01:21:07.320 --> 01:21:09.527
Largest quake in recorded history.

01:21:42.080 --> 01:21:43.206
Oh, no.

01:21:48.440 --> 01:21:51.603
Coit's been burning a while.
She's gone someplace else.

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:55.729
Now, where are you, baby?
Where are you?

01:21:56.840 --> 01:21:58.126
What's your Plan B?

01:22:10.320 --> 01:22:11.367
Oh, shit.

01:22:11.560 --> 01:22:12.607
What's happening?

01:22:12.760 --> 01:22:15.366
We gotta go. Water being pulled out
like that's a tsunami.

01:22:15.520 --> 01:22:17.045
We gotta get outta the bay, now.

01:22:26.280 --> 01:22:29.204
Wait. Wait, wait a second.
Just give me one second.

01:22:31.720 --> 01:22:32.846
God!

01:22:34.720 --> 01:22:37.360
<i>The Weather Service
has issued a tsunami warning...</i>

01:22:37.480 --> 01:22:42.008
<i>...for coastal areas of Northern and Central
California, including the following counties:</i>

01:22:42.160 --> 01:22:43.730
<i>Marin, Napa, San Francisco
and Monterey.</i>

01:22:55.040 --> 01:22:56.530
Come on, guys. We gotta go!

01:22:56.680 --> 01:22:58.364
We gotta go! We gotta move fast!

01:22:58.520 --> 01:23:00.363
We gotta get to Daniel's building.

01:23:14.520 --> 01:23:15.851
Ray.

01:23:16.280 --> 01:23:17.327
I see it!

01:23:22.160 --> 01:23:25.642
All right, hold on!
We gotta get over it before it crests!

01:24:17.440 --> 01:24:18.487
Come on!

01:24:18.760 --> 01:24:19.761
Come on!

01:24:22.520 --> 01:24:23.681
We're gonna make it.

01:24:23.840 --> 01:24:25.000
- We're gonna make it!
- Yeah.

01:24:33.200 --> 01:24:34.440
- Oh, Shit!
- Aah!

01:24:42.800 --> 01:24:43.847
Ray!

01:25:06.960 --> 01:25:08.041
Move it!

01:25:08.400 --> 01:25:10.129
Out of my way!

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:36.081
Shit.

01:26:51.880 --> 01:26:53.609
What's that noise?

01:27:04.360 --> 01:27:05.771
We're not high enough.

01:27:07.760 --> 01:27:10.047
Get down! Get down! Take cover!

01:27:10.280 --> 01:27:11.486
Hold on tight, Ollie!

01:27:47.040 --> 01:27:48.201
Ben!

01:27:57.040 --> 01:27:58.201
Ollie.

01:28:14.720 --> 01:28:16.245
The water's still rising.

01:28:16.400 --> 01:28:18.050
We have to get higher.

01:28:19.720 --> 01:28:20.846
This way!

01:28:21.120 --> 01:28:22.167
Ben.

01:28:22.320 --> 01:28:24.209
Ollie, come. Grab on.

01:28:24.640 --> 01:28:25.880
I've got you.

01:28:49.640 --> 01:28:51.483
Oh, my God.

01:28:59.680 --> 01:29:01.364
Where is she, Ray?

01:29:01.960 --> 01:29:03.485
She's a smart girl.

01:29:03.760 --> 01:29:05.922
She'd know to head
for one of these high-rises.

01:29:06.480 --> 01:29:09.529
- Hmm.
- We just gotta find her.

01:29:21.480 --> 01:29:23.209
- Ugh.
- Are you all right?

01:29:23.360 --> 01:29:26.125
We need to take a look at that leg.
Okay.

01:29:26.280 --> 01:29:29.284
Ollie, see if there's something
that we can use as a bandage.

01:29:29.800 --> 01:29:32.280
- And see if you can find clean water.
- Yeah.

01:29:34.840 --> 01:29:35.966
Okay.

01:29:39.320 --> 01:29:41.687
Okay. Let's see
what we're dealing with here.

01:29:51.640 --> 01:29:52.801
What?

01:29:54.680 --> 01:29:56.284
You're absolutely...

01:29:58.400 --> 01:29:59.845
You're unbelievable.

01:30:17.680 --> 01:30:19.364
Mum's going to love her.

01:30:23.320 --> 01:30:25.049
There are a few towels in here.

01:30:25.200 --> 01:30:26.247
Oh, great.

01:30:27.160 --> 01:30:29.288
I'll look for some water.

01:30:36.960 --> 01:30:38.166
Heh.

01:30:58.120 --> 01:30:59.770
Just jump! Come on!

01:31:01.640 --> 01:31:02.801
I got you.

01:31:26.440 --> 01:31:27.487
Hey!

01:31:27.720 --> 01:31:30.200
I can see some people in a boat!

01:31:36.760 --> 01:31:37.966
No way.

01:31:38.120 --> 01:31:39.167
No way!

01:31:39.440 --> 01:31:40.885
Those are my parents!

01:31:42.120 --> 01:31:44.088
Mom! Dad! Mom!

01:31:44.760 --> 01:31:46.171
- Help! Hey!
- Dad!

01:31:50.880 --> 01:31:52.609
Dad! Mom!

01:31:53.240 --> 01:31:54.321
Mom.

01:31:59.520 --> 01:32:00.760
They can't hear us.

01:32:06.680 --> 01:32:07.727
What?

01:32:11.560 --> 01:32:14.166
Em, if we don't get to her soon,
we're gonna need some gas.

01:32:14.320 --> 01:32:16.160
We got maybe an hour and a half, tops
before...

01:32:16.280 --> 01:32:17.281
- Ray.
- Yeah?

01:32:17.440 --> 01:32:18.601
Hold on.

01:32:31.120 --> 01:32:33.691
Oh, my God. Oh, my God, it's Blake!

01:32:33.840 --> 01:32:35.001
Oh, my God!

01:32:35.160 --> 01:32:36.889
Emma! Oh, we found her.

01:32:54.680 --> 01:32:55.920
Blake!

01:32:57.560 --> 01:32:59.164
Help! Blake!

01:33:02.480 --> 01:33:03.527
Blake!

01:33:07.840 --> 01:33:08.966
Ollie!

01:33:16.400 --> 01:33:17.640
Ollie!

01:33:17.840 --> 01:33:18.921
Ollie!

01:33:21.920 --> 01:33:22.921
Ollie!

01:33:24.560 --> 01:33:25.686
Ollie!

01:33:27.640 --> 01:33:29.529
I've got you! I've got you!

01:33:29.680 --> 01:33:30.761
Where's Blake?

01:33:30.920 --> 01:33:32.001
She's back there!

01:33:39.280 --> 01:33:40.361
Stay here, Ollie.

01:33:44.480 --> 01:33:45.527
Blake!

01:33:47.400 --> 01:33:48.447
Blake!

01:33:49.040 --> 01:33:50.087
Bla...

01:33:51.800 --> 01:33:53.723
No! No!

01:33:54.480 --> 01:33:55.766
No!

01:33:57.360 --> 01:33:59.203
The building's sinking!
We have to move.

01:33:59.400 --> 01:34:00.640
We have to move up.

01:34:00.800 --> 01:34:02.404
Come on, Ollie, hurry!

01:34:14.080 --> 01:34:15.127
No, no, no.

01:34:15.280 --> 01:34:17.886
No! Oh, my God, Blake!

01:34:18.320 --> 01:34:20.243
Em, take the wheel.

01:34:20.400 --> 01:34:22.482
I see a way in. I'm going after her.

01:34:22.640 --> 01:34:23.766
Ray!

01:34:28.080 --> 01:34:29.127
I'm bringing her back.

01:34:34.320 --> 01:34:35.651
I promise.

01:35:43.400 --> 01:35:45.164
- Blake!
- Daddy!

01:35:45.960 --> 01:35:47.041
The door's blocked!

01:35:47.200 --> 01:35:49.202
Blake, don't worry.
I'm gonna get you outta here.

01:35:49.360 --> 01:35:50.441
Okay? I'm getting you out!

01:36:17.840 --> 01:36:19.365
Daddy, I'm scared.

01:36:19.520 --> 01:36:20.567
I'm running out of air!

01:36:22.120 --> 01:36:24.885
Daddy, I don't think I can do this.

01:36:25.280 --> 01:36:27.044
Blake, you hold on, hold on!

01:36:35.120 --> 01:36:36.246
There!

01:36:38.200 --> 01:36:40.328
Ben, I don't want Blake to die.

01:36:40.520 --> 01:36:43.205
She's not going to die.
I'm going back for her.

01:36:43.720 --> 01:36:47.202
Okay? But I need you to stay here.

01:36:47.400 --> 01:36:48.447
Okay?

01:36:49.920 --> 01:36:51.206
Good boy.

01:37:11.480 --> 01:37:12.527
Ollie!

01:37:27.640 --> 01:37:28.687
Ben!

01:37:30.880 --> 01:37:32.644
On my back! On my back, Ollie!

01:37:42.040 --> 01:37:43.849
Blake's going to die.

01:37:44.560 --> 01:37:45.925
Isn't she?

01:37:51.560 --> 01:37:52.561
All right.

01:37:52.760 --> 01:37:53.966
Dad.

01:37:54.560 --> 01:37:55.561
I love...

01:37:55.760 --> 01:37:56.921
I love you, Dad.

01:37:59.080 --> 01:38:00.969
And please tell...

01:38:01.120 --> 01:38:03.327
Please tell Mom that I love her, too.

01:38:03.520 --> 01:38:04.806
Blake, don't you quit on me!

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:07.570
- Blake!
- I'm sorry, Dad.

01:38:07.720 --> 01:38:08.881
Blake!

01:38:23.880 --> 01:38:24.961
Blake!

01:38:30.720 --> 01:38:31.926
No!

01:38:33.520 --> 01:38:34.760
Blake!

01:39:28.280 --> 01:39:30.806
Blake!

01:39:31.240 --> 01:39:32.810
Blake! Oh, my God!

01:39:32.960 --> 01:39:35.008
Move, Ollie. Move.

01:39:39.520 --> 01:39:41.124
Come on. Breathe, Blake.

01:39:41.560 --> 01:39:42.607
Breathe, honey.

01:39:56.640 --> 01:39:58.210
We gotta get outta here.
Break a window!

01:40:25.480 --> 01:40:26.641
Oh, my God.

01:40:38.520 --> 01:40:40.329
Move! Get outta the way!

01:40:43.440 --> 01:40:44.487
Watch out!

01:40:52.520 --> 01:40:53.965
Get on! Let's go! Let's go!

01:40:54.120 --> 01:40:55.610
Move. Move, Ollie, move.

01:40:55.760 --> 01:40:56.761
Come on, Ray.

01:40:56.920 --> 01:40:58.649
- Take her, Emma.
- I got her.

01:40:58.800 --> 01:41:00.802
It's okay. Here you go.

01:41:01.320 --> 01:41:02.367
Wake up, honey.

01:41:02.640 --> 01:41:03.801
Come on.

01:41:03.960 --> 01:41:05.041
Okay, we got her.

01:41:05.600 --> 01:41:07.967
Get us outta here, Em!
The building's coming down.

01:41:18.320 --> 01:41:19.481
<i>Everybody down!</i>

01:41:55.200 --> 01:41:56.201
Okay, Blake.

01:41:56.360 --> 01:41:58.806
Your dad and I, we're right here now.
We're right here.

01:41:58.960 --> 01:42:01.042
Breathe, Blake. Breathe.

01:42:01.880 --> 01:42:04.008
- Come on. Breathe.
- Don't leave me.

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:07.810
Dad and I are right here, all right?
Okay.

01:42:29.280 --> 01:42:30.327
Ray...

01:42:38.600 --> 01:42:41.331
My baby.

01:43:03.960 --> 01:43:06.770
I'm not gonna lose you, too. No.

01:43:07.800 --> 01:43:08.847
Come on.

01:43:14.280 --> 01:43:15.406
Oh, my God.

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:17.684
Okay. Okay.

01:43:22.800 --> 01:43:25.929
- Mom.
- I'm right here. I'm right here. Yeah.

01:43:34.280 --> 01:43:36.408
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

01:43:52.760 --> 01:43:56.082
<i>We are now getting a better
picture of the scale of the devastation.</i>

01:43:56.240 --> 01:43:58.481
<i>And this was the sight
in many neighborhoods:</i>

01:43:58.640 --> 01:44:00.483
<i>Families and friends
huddled together...</i>

01:44:00.640 --> 01:44:03.007
<i>...shaken but grateful to still be alive.</i>

01:44:03.160 --> 01:44:06.926
<i>Seismologists will be keeping a close watch
on all of the world's tectonic plates...</i>

01:44:07.080 --> 01:44:11.130
<i>...as the San Andreas quake could have
rippling effects throughout the globe.</i>

01:44:11.280 --> 01:44:13.169
<i>Closer to home,
nerves are finally calming.</i>

01:44:13.320 --> 01:44:14.446
<i>Hey.</i>

01:44:16.640 --> 01:44:17.926
You did good.

01:44:19.080 --> 01:44:20.445
Thank you.

01:44:21.800 --> 01:44:23.165
We all did.

01:44:25.680 --> 01:44:29.526
<i>Authorities in San Francisco are attributing
a tremendous amount of lives saved...</i>

01:44:29.680 --> 01:44:34.288
<i>...thanks to local experts, who were able
to give ample warning of the massive quake.</i>

01:44:42.520 --> 01:44:45.922
<i>Meanwhile, recovery efforts
have begun in the Bay Area...</i>

01:44:46.080 --> 01:44:48.845
<i>...where FEMA, the National Guard
and U.N. relief teams...</i>

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:50.286
<i>...have all been mobilized...</i>

01:44:50.440 --> 01:44:54.525
<i>...aided by the thousands of volunteers
pouring into the state.</i>

01:45:15.360 --> 01:45:18.409
Our Father, who art in Heaven,
hallowed by thy name.

01:45:25.720 --> 01:45:27.722
Ollie. Ben.

01:45:29.200 --> 01:45:30.201
I, uh...

01:45:31.080 --> 01:45:32.286
I found this on the boat.

01:45:38.400 --> 01:45:39.845
Thank you.

01:45:50.200 --> 01:45:52.521
I wanna thank you guys
for being there for Blake.

01:45:52.680 --> 01:45:53.886
Yeah, thank you.

01:45:54.360 --> 01:45:55.566
You're welcome.

01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:58.287
But it was more like
she was there for us.

01:45:58.800 --> 01:46:00.165
I think.

01:46:09.160 --> 01:46:11.003
This is incredible.

01:46:13.880 --> 01:46:15.006
So...

01:46:15.160 --> 01:46:16.491
...what now?

01:46:34.320 --> 01:46:35.970
Now we rebuild.
