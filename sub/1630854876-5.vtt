WEBVTT

00:01.898 --> 00:02.968
<i>Previously on
"The Company You Keep"...</i>

00:03.106 --> 00:04.763
- Simon?
- Yeah, he started calling

00:04.901 --> 00:06.040
last week.
I don't know why.

00:06.178 --> 00:07.938
I don't need to know why.
You can decline.

00:08.077 --> 00:10.596
Claire Fox? Her support
is not the kind you want.

00:10.734 --> 00:11.977
It's amazing
what aligning yourself

00:12.115 --> 00:13.427
with the right people
can accomplish.

00:13.565 --> 00:14.704
Always comes at a cost.

00:14.842 --> 00:16.292
I wanted to introduce you
to Jennifer West.

00:16.430 --> 00:18.708
I think she'd make a great
addition to your campaign.

00:18.846 --> 00:19.950
Connor Maguire is stateside?

00:20.089 --> 00:21.193
What are you
doing here?

00:21.331 --> 00:23.023
The feds are
already watching us.

00:23.161 --> 00:25.197
Your father trusts me
to handle things.

00:25.335 --> 00:27.303
You know when I found out
that Daphne was working with

00:27.441 --> 00:28.580
the man who ripped me off...

00:28.718 --> 00:30.168
kick in the balls
that felt like, you know?

00:30.306 --> 00:31.962
That's Daphne's secret
revenue stream.

00:32.101 --> 00:33.964
That covers the deal
Daphne and I had.

00:50.153 --> 00:51.534
- Charlie.
- Yeah.

00:51.672 --> 00:53.053
I finally figured it out.

00:54.675 --> 00:55.986
Figured what out?

00:57.160 --> 00:58.989
17 across. Riposte.

00:59.921 --> 01:00.991
Huh.

01:02.476 --> 01:04.892
Guessing the fencing lessons
I took as a kid paid off.

01:05.030 --> 01:08.068
Thank you.
Do not tell my mom.

01:08.206 --> 01:09.138
Nice.

01:09.931 --> 01:12.313
- What else you got?
- Uh...

01:13.107 --> 01:14.143
mm.

01:14.281 --> 01:17.870
Five down,
1963 Hepburn and Grant romp.

01:18.008 --> 01:19.009
Seven letters.

01:21.115 --> 01:22.668
- Hey.
- Huh?

01:22.806 --> 01:24.946
- You good?
- Yeah.

01:25.085 --> 01:29.019
I'm just thinking about
your, uh, crossword.

01:31.746 --> 01:33.955
You know you can tell me
if something's going on.

01:34.473 --> 01:35.612
Hey...

01:37.027 --> 01:40.030
what if we skip work today?

01:40.169 --> 01:42.412
Crawl back into bed,
cue up a film,

01:42.550 --> 01:44.034
pretend the world
doesn't exist.

01:47.037 --> 01:48.038
Hmm.

01:48.694 --> 01:49.799
Hello, world.

01:50.903 --> 01:52.284
- I'll be right back.
- Yeah.

01:54.907 --> 01:56.288
Hey.

01:56.426 --> 01:58.532
I knew we'd get something
on the security cams.

01:58.670 --> 02:00.050
Can you make out
our mystery man?

02:01.017 --> 02:02.639
Partial plate?
I'll take it.

02:03.502 --> 02:05.401
No, that's great, Mason.

02:05.539 --> 02:07.817
Yeah, okay I'll see you soon.

02:11.683 --> 02:12.994
You got to go.

02:15.514 --> 02:17.827
As much as I want to stay.

02:19.104 --> 02:22.832
Um, I got a bunch of stuff
to do here anyway, so...

02:25.455 --> 02:27.975
Hey, look, I'm around later
if you want to talk.

02:28.113 --> 02:29.735
Okay, great.

02:29.873 --> 02:31.875
- Okay. Have a good day.
- You too.

02:36.708 --> 02:38.951
- Hey, uh, "Charade."
- Huh?

02:39.089 --> 02:40.919
Five down.

02:41.057 --> 02:44.681
"Charade." It's one of
my parents' favorite movies.

02:44.819 --> 02:47.270
When this thing wraps up,
maybe we can stay in,

02:47.408 --> 02:50.066
watch a little <i>Charade</i>,
see where the day takes us.

02:50.204 --> 02:51.378
Yeah, I'd like that.

02:52.448 --> 02:54.795
- Me too.
- I'll see you.

02:54.933 --> 02:56.141
Bye.

03:06.462 --> 03:09.948
What happened to your
associate was regretful,

03:11.329 --> 03:13.262
but I assure you,
Connor Maguire will have--

03:13.400 --> 03:14.435
Don't you mean your brother?

03:16.161 --> 03:18.128
Connor Maguire
will have no impact

03:18.267 --> 03:19.820
on our partnership
moving forward.

03:26.516 --> 03:28.863
I understand we don't get
to choose our family,

03:29.001 --> 03:31.176
but it's not just your brother
that concerns me.

03:31.314 --> 03:33.040
Since we began selling
your product,

03:33.178 --> 03:34.662
the feds have been all over us.

03:34.800 --> 03:38.079
Your partnership comes with
too much heat.

03:38.218 --> 03:39.702
What if I could
turn down the heat?

03:39.840 --> 03:42.222
Say I find a way to get
our product out of

03:42.360 --> 03:44.465
those shipping containers
and back on the streets.

03:44.603 --> 03:46.502
You do that,
I think we can find

03:46.640 --> 03:47.986
some way to work
out our differences.

03:48.124 --> 03:50.506
Still we're talking
Coast Guard, port authority,

03:50.644 --> 03:54.958
customs--so, unless you have
friends in high places...

03:56.028 --> 03:57.754
As a matter of fact, I do.

03:58.617 --> 04:01.102
- There she is.
- Hey, babe.

04:01.241 --> 04:04.105
- Oh, that dress is stunning.
- Thank you.

04:04.244 --> 04:06.522
Thanks for meeting me
on such short notice.

04:06.660 --> 04:08.662
Stop. I've been wanting
to catch up.

04:08.800 --> 04:10.491
I hear you've been
spending time in Europe.

04:10.629 --> 04:13.011
- Ooh, la, la.
- I've been consulting

04:13.149 --> 04:15.047
for this big transnational organization,

04:15.185 --> 04:17.187
but I must say
the experience has been

04:17.326 --> 04:20.018
tragically lacking in fine wine
and Italian villas.

04:20.156 --> 04:21.468
Couldn't be worse
than the swamp.

04:21.606 --> 04:25.506
Well, let's just say it is
no toga party at Sigma Chi.

04:25.644 --> 04:26.611
Right?

04:26.749 --> 04:29.717
Well, nothing is.

04:29.855 --> 04:31.271
- Excuse me.
- Yup.

04:31.409 --> 04:32.789
- Mimosas?
- Please.

04:33.894 --> 04:35.965
- Let's make them bottomless.
- All right.

04:37.863 --> 04:40.694
I'm never gonna let you
live that down.

04:40.832 --> 04:44.525
- Okay, can I be real?
- When are you not?

04:44.663 --> 04:45.871
Fair.

04:46.009 --> 04:48.253
The red tape in this town
is killing me.

04:48.391 --> 04:49.530
- Don't get me started.
- Here you go.

04:49.668 --> 04:51.152
Thank you.

04:51.291 --> 04:54.880
If anyone could help me
grease the wheels in Washington

04:55.018 --> 04:58.574
it is the best damn social
chair Kappa Theta ever had.

04:58.712 --> 05:01.335
- I really was.
- I still can't believe

05:01.473 --> 05:04.096
you're chief of staff
to the House Majority Whip.

05:04.234 --> 05:07.445
I thought you'd be working for
the president by now.

05:07.583 --> 05:10.240
Trust me, I'm on it.

05:10.379 --> 05:11.932
I bet you are.

05:12.070 --> 05:15.245
So for your bureaucratic nightmare,

05:15.384 --> 05:17.834
you can always hire lobbyists.
That takes time.

05:17.972 --> 05:19.733
Which I don't have.

05:19.871 --> 05:22.805
Come on.
Give me the good stuff.

05:22.943 --> 05:24.393
Sister to sister.

05:25.635 --> 05:28.258
<i>♪ Over and over again ♪</i>

05:31.538 --> 05:32.401
Well...

05:33.574 --> 05:35.887
if you really want to
cut through red tape,

05:37.406 --> 05:38.890
I may have a guy.

05:39.442 --> 05:40.340
Go on.

05:41.617 --> 05:43.653
His name is John Baylor.

05:43.791 --> 05:46.380
Former MI-6
turned Beltway fixer.

05:46.518 --> 05:48.382
Think of him as a sort of
unofficial lobbyist

05:48.520 --> 05:50.419
who can apply pressure
to the right people.

05:51.765 --> 05:54.630
Your infrastructure,
my contacts.

05:54.768 --> 05:57.426
A rising tide raises all ships.
Isn't that what they say?

06:02.465 --> 06:03.984
Look, I get it.

06:04.122 --> 06:07.297
You respond to strength,
and so do I.

06:07.436 --> 06:10.024
So let me show you what
having your back looks like.

06:10.162 --> 06:13.614
Baylor's a bit eccentric,
but effective.

06:15.133 --> 06:17.446
Just call this number,
and you should know...

06:19.275 --> 06:21.070
hiring him can come at a cost.

06:21.967 --> 06:22.968
Believe me, I can afford it.

06:23.106 --> 06:24.453
I'm not talking money.

06:25.799 --> 06:28.698
In DC, secrets
are currency, babe.

06:28.836 --> 06:31.218
He's got dirt on everyone who
gets into business with him.

06:31.356 --> 06:35.015
Rumor has it he has
a kind of black book,

06:35.153 --> 06:36.982
but this one's full
of blackmail.

06:38.674 --> 06:40.400
You don't say.

06:43.851 --> 06:45.163
That's the car.

06:45.301 --> 06:46.716
The guy I saw right after
the money drop.

06:46.854 --> 06:48.856
Well unfortunately,
this is the only security cam

06:48.994 --> 06:50.720
in the area.
Hopefully one of these images

06:50.858 --> 06:52.412
can give us a full plate.

06:52.550 --> 06:54.414
Once we ID Daphne's
new revenue stream,

06:54.552 --> 06:56.519
we can finally get inside
her operation.

06:56.657 --> 06:58.348
And find out why she's still
slumming it in Baltimore

06:58.487 --> 07:00.765
while Connor's sipping
margaritas in Mexico.

07:00.903 --> 07:03.008
That car's gotta
still be out there.

07:03.146 --> 07:05.114
We just need a better angle.
What about that one?

07:06.598 --> 07:09.014
Are you about to ask me
what I think you about to ask?

07:09.152 --> 07:10.913
Mason, enhance.

07:15.607 --> 07:18.058
There it is. Dodge Charger,
Maryland plate.

07:18.196 --> 07:21.682
Foxtrot, echo, 9, 4, 9, 2, November.

07:21.820 --> 07:23.512
Reported stolen
a few weeks ago.

07:23.650 --> 07:25.030
Okay.

07:25.168 --> 07:27.757
Okay, so he used it
for the job,

07:27.895 --> 07:28.862
ditched it after the drop.

07:29.000 --> 07:30.380
Pull up all body shops and

07:30.519 --> 07:32.728
salvage yards within
a 50-mile radius.

07:32.866 --> 07:34.488
He can't hide forever.

07:35.247 --> 07:37.387
<i>Charlie.</i>

07:37.526 --> 07:40.529
Otto, hey. Did you chop that
car from the last job yet?

07:40.667 --> 07:43.255
The Charger? Still here.

07:43.393 --> 07:45.223
<i>Why, you wanna take it
for another spin?</i>

07:45.361 --> 07:47.018
No. Look,
scratch chopping it, okay?

07:47.156 --> 07:48.364
I need you to crush it.

07:48.502 --> 07:50.400
Bro, that's cutting into
my bottom line.

07:50.539 --> 07:52.195
I can't sell car parts
if the car's crushed.

07:52.333 --> 07:53.334
No, no, no. Stop, stop.

07:53.473 --> 07:55.164
I need you to hear me
on this, okay?

07:55.302 --> 07:58.063
It's gotta disappear.
You got it?

07:58.201 --> 08:00.549
You're killing me, man,
but fine.

08:00.687 --> 08:02.102
I'll make it up to you.

08:02.240 --> 08:03.344
Yup.

08:05.208 --> 08:06.589
Is that about the car?

08:09.972 --> 08:11.698
Why are you so worried
all of a sudden?

08:12.699 --> 08:13.562
Just being careful.

08:14.908 --> 08:16.841
Hey, uh, do me a favor.

08:16.979 --> 08:18.463
Tell mom to keep Ollie

08:18.601 --> 08:20.361
at Uncle Gio's another
couple days.

08:20.500 --> 08:23.192
I just--I want the dust
to settle on this last job.

08:25.056 --> 08:26.713
Sure. Um...

08:27.748 --> 08:29.198
yeah, speaking of, uh,

08:29.336 --> 08:31.787
our least favorite regular
just walked in.

08:31.925 --> 08:33.720
Please, sir,
can I have some more?

08:35.169 --> 08:37.309
Sorry, you want us
to con a spy?

08:37.447 --> 08:38.863
Ex-spy.

08:39.001 --> 08:41.175
He's got a little black book
that could prove useful to me.

08:41.313 --> 08:43.177
You know what, lady?
I'm getting a little tired

08:43.315 --> 08:46.664
of you and your demands.
Our debt is paid to you.

08:46.802 --> 08:48.182
- Easy, Pop.
- Wrong.

08:48.320 --> 08:51.289
Because now, thanks to you,
Connor and I are in a footrace

08:51.427 --> 08:53.118
to control this organization.

08:53.256 --> 08:56.536
And now, he's in Mexico with
a $10 million head start.

08:56.674 --> 08:58.986
- Thanks to us?
- Oh, don't play
innocent with me.

08:59.124 --> 09:01.471
I know you brought him in
to undermine me.

09:01.610 --> 09:03.370
Family drama's
really not our problem.

09:03.508 --> 09:06.028
Yes, it is, because
Connor wants you dead.

09:06.166 --> 09:08.651
Your family too.

09:08.789 --> 09:11.654
And I'm the only one standing
in the way of that happening.

09:17.004 --> 09:18.661
Okay, so...

09:20.111 --> 09:21.768
we steal a little black book.

09:23.942 --> 09:25.565
Lay it on us.

09:25.703 --> 09:28.671
It belongs to a fixer
named John Baylor.

09:28.809 --> 09:31.674
The guy is hired by politicians
to clean up their messes,

09:31.812 --> 09:34.194
ruin their enemies,
pay off whistle-blowers.

09:34.332 --> 09:36.576
- You want his blackmail.
- Now you're catching on.

09:36.714 --> 09:38.578
I like not being dead.

09:38.716 --> 09:41.511
What's the real value
in this for you? Hmm?

09:41.650 --> 09:44.100
I mean, you deal with
criminals, not politicians.

09:44.238 --> 09:45.205
Is there a difference?

09:45.343 --> 09:47.103
Look, if you're, um,

09:47.241 --> 09:50.382
worried about
your little moral code,

09:50.520 --> 09:53.523
no one is in it
who isn't already dirty.

09:55.318 --> 09:57.148
That's how you reach Baylor.

09:59.184 --> 10:01.359
You want us to go after
a real-life James Bond

10:01.497 --> 10:04.224
with nothing to go on
but a phone number.

10:04.362 --> 10:08.055
He's a paranoid,
Cold War relic

10:08.193 --> 10:09.609
with no connection
to the world.

10:09.747 --> 10:11.196
It's fun, right?

10:13.198 --> 10:14.717
See? I knew you'd like
a challenge.

10:14.855 --> 10:17.478
Good luck, Nicolettis.
You're gonna need it.

10:28.489 --> 10:30.146
All right, John Baylor,

10:30.284 --> 10:33.253
former agent for MI6, allegedly.

10:33.391 --> 10:35.738
In the late aughts, he was
undercover as a professor

10:35.876 --> 10:38.465
at Thornton College
until the dean blew his cover.

10:38.603 --> 10:40.950
MI6 disavows him,
sends out a burn notice,

10:41.088 --> 10:42.262
revokes his passport,
whole nine.

10:42.400 --> 10:43.608
Wait, wait,
hold on a second.

10:43.746 --> 10:46.404
That's all we got?

10:46.542 --> 10:48.233
Guess I didn't need
to bring out the board.

10:48.371 --> 10:49.441
Guy's trained to be invisible.

10:49.579 --> 10:50.822
He knows how to cover
his tracks.

10:50.960 --> 10:52.134
And now,
he's using those skills

10:52.272 --> 10:53.825
to profit off of DC's dirtiest.

10:53.963 --> 10:56.103
It's always nice to see
someone land on their feet.

10:56.241 --> 10:57.829
Hey, Pop, did you get
anything on the ground

10:57.967 --> 10:59.900
that would lead us back
to this guy's black book?

11:00.038 --> 11:02.420
Turns out
that spying on a spy

11:02.558 --> 11:04.594
is as difficult
as you'd expect.

11:04.733 --> 11:08.288
I mean, this guy's
tradecraft is top notch.

11:08.426 --> 11:10.255
He meets his clients
in public places

11:10.393 --> 11:11.912
where it's either
too loud to listen

11:12.050 --> 11:13.465
or too empty
to get close to him.

11:13.603 --> 11:16.434
He uses surveillance detection
routes to run his errands.

11:16.572 --> 11:18.367
Okay, so the usual tricks
aren't gonna work.

11:18.505 --> 11:19.851
We're just gonna have to
lure him to us.

11:19.989 --> 11:21.473
Ooh, you mean hire him.

11:21.611 --> 11:23.027
Buddy of mine
at the Drakefield

11:23.165 --> 11:25.926
said that one Ray Tipton Jr.'s
checking out tomorrow morning.

11:26.064 --> 11:27.445
- RTJ?
- Mm-hmm.

11:27.583 --> 11:31.104
Oh, he's a worse human than
his dad was a vice-president.

11:31.242 --> 11:32.381
It's all over the tabloids.

11:34.452 --> 11:36.626
What? You never stood in line
at the grocery store?

11:36.765 --> 11:39.940
Well, hey, look, I'm thinking
that RTJ had a wild night

11:40.078 --> 11:41.459
that he's gonna want buried.

11:41.597 --> 11:43.703
So we slip Baylor a phone
with some delicious blackmail.

11:43.841 --> 11:45.463
Give him some more dirt
for his collection.

11:45.601 --> 11:47.465
Along with some malware
that would give me access

11:47.603 --> 11:49.018
to his computer
and all his files.

11:49.156 --> 11:51.124
And then his secrets
become our secrets.

11:51.262 --> 11:52.953
That's good.

11:55.680 --> 11:58.648
Can't hire a fixer without
breaking something.

12:00.616 --> 12:02.514
Oh, I've always wanted
to do this.

12:02.652 --> 12:03.723
Batter up!

12:08.866 --> 12:11.247
- Explain that to me!
- No, don't
blame this on me.

12:11.385 --> 12:12.662
Hurry, before anyone hears.

12:12.801 --> 12:14.388
I didn't see your name
on the partner rolls

12:14.526 --> 12:15.838
at Skadden or Latham.

12:17.288 --> 12:18.876
I've got my own shingle.

12:19.014 --> 12:21.223
Do you have the money?

12:21.361 --> 12:23.812
I am so sick
of you bringing us down.

12:23.950 --> 12:26.159
You just barge right in.

12:26.297 --> 12:29.403
Oh, yeah? Maybe if Ray
wasn't such a lying piece--

12:29.541 --> 12:31.509
You just talking, talking,
but you never say anything.

12:31.647 --> 12:33.338
You're talking at me.
Don't talk to me.

12:33.476 --> 12:34.754
Who the hell are you?

12:36.479 --> 12:38.412
Excuse me. Hello?

12:38.550 --> 12:40.518
I said who the hell are you?

12:40.656 --> 12:42.934
Oh, let me guess, Ray sent
another man to manipulate me.

12:43.072 --> 12:45.695
Oh, it's like I said.
It's just like I said, man.

12:45.834 --> 12:48.112
- She's gonna be a problem.
- I'm the problem?

12:48.250 --> 12:49.596
She's gonna sing
like a canary.

12:49.734 --> 12:51.425
Canary?
What are you, an ornithologist

12:51.563 --> 12:52.772
- all of a sudden?
- You know, you're a walking

12:52.910 --> 12:53.945
contact high.

12:54.083 --> 12:56.051
- You, shut up.
- I--

12:56.189 --> 12:57.777
Shut up.

12:57.915 --> 13:00.538
Why don't you all shut up?

13:01.988 --> 13:04.369
What are we dealing with?

13:04.507 --> 13:06.544
Things got a little messy
for my client last night.

13:06.682 --> 13:08.201
I need you to make it go away.

13:08.339 --> 13:10.582
Make it go away?
I came here to be with

13:10.720 --> 13:13.482
my boyfriend, and he left
this morning with some hooker.

13:13.620 --> 13:14.794
Takes one to know one, huh?

13:14.932 --> 13:17.417
Look, she's got photos.
I need you to keep her

13:17.555 --> 13:19.488
from leaking anything
to the tabloids.

13:19.626 --> 13:22.215
You, clean that up and
whatever else you've snorted.

13:22.353 --> 13:24.389
You, replace the sheets.

13:24.527 --> 13:27.220
- You.
- Seriously?

13:27.358 --> 13:28.842
I mean, we hired you.

13:28.980 --> 13:31.327
Now, I am literally cleaning
up that cheater's mess.

13:31.465 --> 13:32.812
Don't make me ask again.

13:41.890 --> 13:43.167
So we're looking good.

13:43.305 --> 13:44.824
Poll numbers are up.
Money's coming in.

13:44.962 --> 13:47.516
But this line's heading
in the wrong direction.

13:47.654 --> 13:50.070
Oh, that's David's
approval with the 18 to 29s.

13:50.208 --> 13:51.692
Now, we tried to engage,

13:51.831 --> 13:54.247
but it's hard to get Gen Z to
care about the real issues.

13:54.385 --> 13:56.007
Yeah, maybe with that attitude.

13:57.767 --> 13:59.631
Thank you, Ms. West,
but that's not--

13:59.769 --> 14:01.530
Let's hear
what she has to say.

14:05.741 --> 14:08.709
Well, I couldn't help but
notice that you don't have

14:08.848 --> 14:10.366
a dedicated
social media strategist,

14:10.504 --> 14:12.679
and your Twitter feed
shows how well that's going.

14:12.817 --> 14:15.302
Platitudes and infographics?
Blah.

14:15.440 --> 14:18.271
Social media
isn't just about communication.

14:18.409 --> 14:19.582
It's about connection.

14:19.720 --> 14:22.171
For example, Doug, right now
I just know you as

14:22.309 --> 14:25.174
David's campaign manager,
but when I saw that you spent

14:25.312 --> 14:29.316
last Friday night front row
at the Bad Bunny concert,

14:29.454 --> 14:32.423
well, now we're connecting
as people.

14:33.596 --> 14:35.426
So what do you suggest
we do next?

14:35.564 --> 14:37.946
TikTok, Instagram.

14:38.084 --> 14:39.809
You're a charming guy.
Let's use that.

14:40.983 --> 14:44.469
David's a politician,
not an influencer.

14:44.607 --> 14:45.712
I'd argue
they're one in the same.

14:45.850 --> 14:46.955
She's not wrong.

14:48.957 --> 14:52.408
Uh, would you give us
a moment?

14:55.860 --> 14:57.827
Where'd this new aide
come from?

14:57.966 --> 15:00.002
Don't tell me Claire Fox
introduced her to you.

15:01.279 --> 15:04.248
Yeah, well, Claire helps
shore up political support

15:04.386 --> 15:05.905
from some of our donors,
and I...

15:06.043 --> 15:07.147
Did her a favor.

15:09.322 --> 15:10.357
I really wish you'd told me.

15:10.495 --> 15:12.601
It's not a big deal, Dad. Really.

15:12.739 --> 15:15.569
Plus, Jen has some good ideas.

15:15.707 --> 15:19.746
Just don't assume
she's working for you.

15:21.161 --> 15:23.819
When it comes to Claire Fox,
there's always another agenda.

15:32.310 --> 15:34.692
Oh, I not gonna let you
sweep this under the rug.

15:34.830 --> 15:37.039
I am gonna take these pictures
straight to TMZ.

15:37.177 --> 15:38.972
Come on. Is that necessary?

15:39.110 --> 15:41.181
Treat Ray Ray with
the respect he treated me.

15:41.319 --> 15:42.355
If you do that,
the only person

15:42.493 --> 15:44.081
that will get hurt is you.

15:44.219 --> 15:45.220
It doesn't matter what he did.

15:45.358 --> 15:48.016
The woman pays the price. Always.

15:48.154 --> 15:50.018
Which is why you're gonna
take this money.

15:52.882 --> 15:54.263
And you're gonna
forget everything

15:54.401 --> 15:56.127
that's happened here today.

16:00.338 --> 16:02.651
Uh, I gotta--
I gotta take this.

16:02.789 --> 16:05.033
I'm gonna take--I'm gonna
take this, yeah.

16:06.206 --> 16:07.725
Hey, what's up?
<i>You were right.</i>

16:07.863 --> 16:10.210
Some government suits
are here asking questions.

16:11.694 --> 16:14.559
Well, you already took care
of that thing, right?

16:14.697 --> 16:17.390
<i>I was getting to it, bro.
I'm slammed.</i>

16:17.528 --> 16:18.598
Where is it now?

16:18.736 --> 16:20.393
The car is on the north side
of the yard.

16:20.531 --> 16:21.877
I'll give them the grand tour.

16:22.015 --> 16:24.293
That should buy you enough
time to do what you gotta do.

16:24.431 --> 16:25.915
Okay, yeah.
I'll be right there.

16:26.054 --> 16:27.814
Hey, uh, so... ha.

16:27.952 --> 16:30.403
I've got a friend
who has a car emergency.

16:30.541 --> 16:32.198
- Uh, I gotta go now.
- Wait.

16:35.787 --> 16:39.481
Do you idiots ever have a day
without a crisis? Huh?

16:39.619 --> 16:41.414
Cut him loose.
We don't need him here anyway.

16:41.552 --> 16:42.346
Good riddance, Dick.

16:44.244 --> 16:45.107
Go.

16:47.247 --> 16:48.938
Now, hand the man your phone

16:49.077 --> 16:50.906
so we can all move on
with our lives.

16:53.391 --> 16:54.599
Thank you.

16:59.984 --> 17:02.366
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What's with the photos?

17:02.504 --> 17:04.954
Insurance. You don't pay
the rest of my fee

17:05.093 --> 17:07.095
or you decide to disclose
my involvement here,

17:07.233 --> 17:08.993
these go public.

17:09.131 --> 17:10.029
Oh.

17:10.788 --> 17:12.065
What are you doing?

17:12.203 --> 17:14.964
That's the only proof I have
or RTJ and his whore.

17:15.103 --> 17:17.208
Hey, wait.

17:17.346 --> 17:19.452
You can't have digital
evidence floating around.

17:19.590 --> 17:21.040
You never know
who can get to it.

17:24.457 --> 17:25.596
Uh...

17:32.810 --> 17:34.984
Well, I wish I could say
it's been a pleasure.

17:36.296 --> 17:37.159
But it never is.

17:38.954 --> 17:40.473
Wait.

17:40.611 --> 17:42.233
You need to give me a ride.

17:42.371 --> 17:45.478
I would call one,
but you just nuked my phone.

17:45.616 --> 17:47.583
Or I could catch a ride with

17:47.721 --> 17:49.930
one of the paparazzi downstairs.

17:52.795 --> 17:54.935
I thought you had this
all sewn up.

17:57.490 --> 17:59.319
Fine. Come with me.

18:19.546 --> 18:21.030
Can we take a look
over here?

18:21.169 --> 18:22.342
That's where
I park my junkers.

18:22.480 --> 18:23.723
It wouldn't be down there.

18:23.861 --> 18:26.346
Yeah, I'd still like
to take a look.

18:36.253 --> 18:37.668
Oh.

18:40.049 --> 18:41.465
It's Charlie.

18:41.603 --> 18:42.880
Mm, I'll call him back.

18:43.018 --> 18:44.053
No, go ahead and take it.

18:44.192 --> 18:46.021
These cars aren't going anywhere.

18:46.159 --> 18:47.091
True.

18:49.231 --> 18:50.853
- Hey, you.
- Hey.

18:51.889 --> 18:53.304
I know you're at work,
I'm sorry.

18:53.442 --> 18:54.892
I just, uh...

18:55.030 --> 18:56.721
I wanted to hear your voice.

18:56.859 --> 18:58.999
What's going on?
Stuff with the bar?

18:59.138 --> 19:02.624
Yeah, yeah,
something like that.

19:02.762 --> 19:04.315
<i>Hey, I was thinking...</i>

19:04.453 --> 19:06.938
what about
a little stay-cation?

19:07.076 --> 19:09.700
Tonight, escape for a few hours
just you and me.

19:11.978 --> 19:14.325
- Yeah, that sounds great.
- <i>Great.</i>

19:14.463 --> 19:15.671
Meet me at the Langston
at 8:00.

19:15.809 --> 19:17.570
Yeah, okay.
I-- I'll be there.

19:17.708 --> 19:20.228
It's a date. See you soon.

19:29.237 --> 19:30.341
What do you think?

19:30.479 --> 19:32.136
Looks familiar.

19:38.832 --> 19:41.041
I wasn't using him, you know?

19:42.629 --> 19:45.114
I mean, the parties were fun.

19:45.253 --> 19:47.427
The lifestyle.

19:47.565 --> 19:49.084
I didn't come from much, but...

19:49.222 --> 19:51.776
I really thought
we had something.

19:52.950 --> 19:55.953
And now,
I just feel like a fool.

19:56.091 --> 19:58.956
You were right, what you said.

19:59.094 --> 20:01.407
That the woman
always pays the price.

20:04.824 --> 20:05.894
A word of advice.

20:07.792 --> 20:10.381
It may be hard, but let
the past stay the past.

20:15.283 --> 20:17.146
Bet you see a lotta people
with regrets

20:17.285 --> 20:18.424
in your line of work.

20:20.495 --> 20:22.911
Hey, what are you gonna do
with those photographs?

20:25.293 --> 20:28.675
I'm asking 'cause I got a kid,
and I really don't--

20:40.342 --> 20:42.344
I don't know who you are
or what you're angling for,

20:42.482 --> 20:44.104
but your sob story needs work.

20:47.453 --> 20:49.109
Get out.

20:49.248 --> 20:50.939
Don't ever call me again,
and remember,

20:51.077 --> 20:52.941
I have more on you
than you have on me.

20:56.841 --> 21:00.466
<i>And you just slide
the pancake onto the plate.</i>

21:01.846 --> 21:03.538
<i>And boom.</i>

21:03.676 --> 21:05.298
<i>You're done.</i>

21:05.436 --> 21:09.268
<i>My dad always called this
the dinner of champions.</i>

21:11.062 --> 21:12.961
Sorry, that was lame.

21:13.099 --> 21:15.274
Can we go again?

21:15.412 --> 21:17.241
It was great.

21:17.379 --> 21:19.381
The whole point is connecting
over the little things.

21:20.762 --> 21:22.246
Hey, you wanna try some?

21:22.384 --> 21:24.283
I can't let good kimchi-jeon
go to waste.

21:34.327 --> 21:36.087
Go for it.

21:36.225 --> 21:37.710
Just like that.
Yup. Perfect.

21:37.848 --> 21:39.401
Ah! Okay.

21:40.195 --> 21:41.161
And dip.

21:46.719 --> 21:48.652
Mm, mm.

21:53.242 --> 21:55.003
It's hot.

22:00.526 --> 22:02.907
Hope I didn't, uh,

22:03.045 --> 22:04.909
step on any toes
with your team before.

22:05.047 --> 22:07.049
I know they only think
I'm here as a favor.

22:07.187 --> 22:10.087
Hey, I chose to hire you.

22:11.157 --> 22:12.296
I just have a hard time believing

22:12.434 --> 22:14.125
people really want me
at the table.

22:14.263 --> 22:16.921
The truth is,
I got most of my jobs

22:17.059 --> 22:18.544
from my parents
calling in favors.

22:20.062 --> 22:23.963
Listen, I still doubt
I'm here because I earned it.

22:24.101 --> 22:25.930
And sometimes I think
even my own team

22:26.068 --> 22:29.209
doesn't see me for who I am
or what I've done.

22:31.419 --> 22:33.835
My parents could've got me
on any campaign,

22:33.973 --> 22:35.595
and I chose yours

22:35.733 --> 22:37.597
because of who you are.

22:37.735 --> 22:39.392
Because I believe in you.

22:39.530 --> 22:43.327
Maybe it's time the rest of
the team sees the real you.

22:45.743 --> 22:47.055
I certainly like him.

22:50.127 --> 22:52.371
No, Pop, what I said is
for like ten seconds,

22:52.509 --> 22:53.510
I thought he made me.

22:53.648 --> 22:54.821
You shouldn't have improvised.

22:54.959 --> 22:57.721
- We had a plan.
- Didn't work, right?

22:57.859 --> 22:59.136
We had one shot with Baylor.
I took it.

22:59.274 --> 23:01.621
- But that's how you get hurt.
- Hey.

23:01.759 --> 23:02.829
- How'd it go?
- Oh, it's fine.

23:02.967 --> 23:04.175
It's gonna be fine.
I swapped the plate,

23:04.313 --> 23:06.143
and then I called your boy
over at Customs Office

23:06.281 --> 23:08.835
to make sure the new plate
pings far, far from Baltimore.

23:08.973 --> 23:10.906
Good. That should keep
the feds off our asses.

23:11.044 --> 23:12.391
Hey, how'd it go with Baylor?
He take the bait?

23:12.529 --> 23:16.360
Um, so he nuked the phone
before we got out of the room,

23:16.498 --> 23:18.638
but I was able to talk
my way into his car.

23:18.776 --> 23:20.019
- He almost made her.
- No, he didn't.

23:20.157 --> 23:22.539
- It was fine. I'm fine.
- He almost made her.

23:22.677 --> 23:25.196
I shouldn't have left.
No, I could've handled that.

23:25.334 --> 23:27.820
Hey, I handled it,
and I got something.

23:27.958 --> 23:29.131
Whoo! Yay, Bird.

23:29.269 --> 23:32.480
Okay, so he had this key.

23:32.618 --> 23:35.655
Make was Belson.
Printed on it was RMO32.

23:35.793 --> 23:38.278
So I gave it to my guy Stosh
to see what businesses

23:38.417 --> 23:40.453
in the area use that brand
and that locker model.

23:40.591 --> 23:42.179
Because before
he nuked the phone,

23:42.317 --> 23:44.215
he took all of these
photos of the blackmail

23:44.353 --> 23:45.562
with this old-school
spy camera.

23:45.700 --> 23:47.287
- The guy's a total Luddite.
- So wait a minute.

23:47.426 --> 23:48.875
So you're thinking that
Baylor's black book

23:49.013 --> 23:50.394
is actually physical,
not digital.

23:50.532 --> 23:54.363
Yeah and hidden
in one of these lockers.

23:54.502 --> 23:57.781
Ready to look for a needle
in a very large haystack?

23:59.714 --> 24:02.026
Oh, my God.

24:02.164 --> 24:05.029
Okay, look, um,

24:05.167 --> 24:07.929
I had plans with Emma,
so let me call her and cancel.

24:08.067 --> 24:09.793
And then we'll roll
our sleeves up and get going.

24:09.931 --> 24:11.139
Stop. Whoa.

24:11.277 --> 24:12.865
Go spend time
with your girlfriend.

24:13.003 --> 24:14.936
Yeah. We'll tag you
back in tomorrow.

24:15.074 --> 24:16.524
We got this.

24:17.766 --> 24:20.010
Okay. Thanks.

24:25.187 --> 24:27.466
- I'm fine, Pop.
- Shouldn't have improvised.

24:30.020 --> 24:32.091
Nothing on the Charger.

24:32.229 --> 24:33.920
But now I got some ideas
for my next car lease.

24:34.058 --> 24:35.474
- This is a sexy car.
- You know what?

24:36.164 --> 24:37.372
Let's call it.

24:37.510 --> 24:39.132
You should go home,
and I don't wanna be late.

24:39.270 --> 24:41.480
Hot date with Charlie?

24:42.860 --> 24:44.897
Guess he got over
the polygraph.

24:45.035 --> 24:48.245
Yeah, he took it surprisingly
well, all things considered.

24:49.453 --> 24:51.593
Border patrol
found that license plate

24:51.731 --> 24:54.562
you were looking for
abandoned outside El Paso.

24:54.700 --> 24:55.873
You think our mystery man

24:56.011 --> 24:57.357
ditched the plates
before crossing the border?

24:57.496 --> 24:59.463
Yeah, you've been saying
that the revenue stream

24:59.601 --> 25:01.154
would uncover
the Maguires' next move.

25:01.292 --> 25:02.604
And this confirms our intel

25:02.742 --> 25:04.917
that Connor is making in-runs
with the cartels.

25:05.055 --> 25:06.850
We'll need to relocate
some personnel.

25:06.988 --> 25:08.610
- Relocate?
- Yeah.

25:08.748 --> 25:12.096
I'm gonna make a recommendation
that you oversee the operation.

25:12.234 --> 25:14.513
I hear great things
about our Juarez station.

25:18.482 --> 25:21.934
Diplomatic cover,
an international operation,

25:22.072 --> 25:23.452
real action.

25:23.591 --> 25:25.903
I'm a honeypot away from
finishing my bucket list.

25:28.216 --> 25:29.907
Em, this is huge.

25:30.045 --> 25:31.219
Yeah.

25:32.047 --> 25:33.221
Huge.

25:45.129 --> 25:48.547

the tour bus broke down,

27:49.460 --> 27:51.083
I wouldn't have hesitated.

27:51.221 --> 27:52.601
And I know it's impulsive,

27:52.740 --> 27:55.259
which is so not me,
but the thing is...

27:56.813 --> 27:59.539
I already can't sleep
when you're not next to me.

28:03.302 --> 28:04.648
I love you.

28:16.108 --> 28:18.282
Oh, God.

28:18.420 --> 28:20.284
- It's not what you think.
- You don't need to explain.

28:20.422 --> 28:21.527
- It's fine. Totally fine.
- It's--

28:21.665 --> 28:22.597
- No, it's so fine.
- No, no, no, no.

28:22.735 --> 28:25.289
I-it's not fine. Emma...

28:25.427 --> 28:26.566
- I'm gonna go.
- Please don't go.

28:26.705 --> 28:29.397
- Please, Emma, just stay.
- No.

28:30.260 --> 28:31.882
I'm not gonna stay.

28:35.921 --> 28:37.646
Bye, Charlie.

28:54.802 --> 28:55.803
- Hey.
- Hey.

28:56.804 --> 28:58.219
Aren't you, uh,
supposed to be

28:58.357 --> 29:00.566
waking up in silk sheets
right about now?

29:00.704 --> 29:03.293
No, hotel switched
to pima cotton.

29:04.190 --> 29:05.640
Wasn't digging
the thread count.

29:05.778 --> 29:06.710
Mm-hmm.

29:09.333 --> 29:12.578
Night ended early.

29:12.716 --> 29:15.339
- You getting a fresh pot?
- Yeah, for sure.

29:20.655 --> 29:23.451
Hey, so where're we at
with Baylor's black book?

29:23.589 --> 29:26.178
- What'd I miss?
- Uh, Pop and I got through

29:26.316 --> 29:27.731
about half the list last night.

29:27.869 --> 29:32.391
There's still 214 buildings to
go with 32 or more lockers.

29:32.529 --> 29:33.702
You wanna split it up?

29:33.841 --> 29:36.360
I'll take Northeast DC.
You take Northwest.

29:36.498 --> 29:38.121
First, how 'bout you tell me
why you been lying to me.

29:38.259 --> 29:39.536
Yeah, okay.

29:39.674 --> 29:41.710
You've been weird.
I've been patient.

29:41.849 --> 29:43.264
Hey, Bird, we're all going
through a lot right now.

29:43.402 --> 29:45.128
Oh, stop it.

29:45.266 --> 29:47.371
You're my brother.
What's going on?

29:51.272 --> 29:52.998
Hmm. Emma.

29:54.620 --> 29:56.346
I don't think
it's gonna work out.

29:58.106 --> 29:59.487
Why? What happened?

30:02.214 --> 30:04.043
We're just too different.

30:04.181 --> 30:05.424
She don't know about
any of this.

30:05.562 --> 30:07.357
I don't like hiding it
from her.

30:09.738 --> 30:13.397
Yeah.
Gotta let it go though.

30:13.535 --> 30:16.504
Whatever we had,
it's in the past.

30:17.746 --> 30:20.680
Let the past stay the past.

30:22.199 --> 30:23.960
What's that?

30:24.098 --> 30:26.514
I think I know where to find
Baylor's black book.

30:34.211 --> 30:35.661
It's my decision
to make.

30:35.799 --> 30:38.526
Because I'm the candidate,
not my father.

30:39.630 --> 30:41.356
We can discuss this later.

30:44.428 --> 30:46.258
I heard you come home
last night.

30:46.396 --> 30:48.053
What happened to
your stay-cation?

30:49.537 --> 30:51.090
I think we're done.

30:51.228 --> 30:52.574
Why? What happened?

30:55.923 --> 30:57.407
I said the L word.

30:59.512 --> 31:01.411
And Charlie
didn't say it back.

31:03.965 --> 31:06.830
It just... sorta came out,
but I...

31:07.727 --> 31:09.868
Still thought he would--

31:10.006 --> 31:12.284
I mean, I literally
read people for a living.

31:12.422 --> 31:13.802
How could I have been so off?

31:14.734 --> 31:16.736
I was so sure it was real.

31:19.429 --> 31:21.396
I finally let someone in.

31:25.366 --> 31:27.886
I am really sorry, Em.

31:29.749 --> 31:30.750
Yeah.

31:32.269 --> 31:33.443
Me too.

31:35.928 --> 31:37.102
Thornton's campus.

31:37.240 --> 31:39.828
Baylor spent years there
undercover as a professor.

31:39.967 --> 31:42.693
Minutes away from his fat cat
clients on Capitol Hill.

31:42.831 --> 31:44.488
He'd know the place
inside and out.

31:44.626 --> 31:46.974
So remember Baylor's key
had RM printed on it.

31:47.112 --> 31:49.528
Guess which library
has 50 thesis lockers

31:49.666 --> 31:52.013
that use that same key?
Reim Memorial.

31:52.151 --> 31:55.914
Oh, it looks like
your Hail Mary paid off, Bird.

31:58.261 --> 32:01.747
I'll dust off Professor Bloom
so I can keep guard.

32:01.885 --> 32:03.542
I think I still got that
tweed jacket

32:03.680 --> 32:05.716
- laying around here somewhere.
- I miss that guy.

32:05.854 --> 32:08.098
- He still teaching astronomy?
- Russian history.

32:08.236 --> 32:09.651
Reading a lot of Trotsky lately.

32:09.789 --> 32:10.998
He's a fascinating man.

32:11.136 --> 32:13.379
Okay, so while
Professor Pinko's keeping

32:13.517 --> 32:15.278
an eye on the door,
all we gotta do

32:15.416 --> 32:17.797
is pick Baylor's lock,
copy the black book,

32:17.936 --> 32:19.351
and then put it back before
he ever knew we were there.

32:19.489 --> 32:20.766
Oh, is that all?

32:20.904 --> 32:23.251
<i>♪ And you got it ♪</i>

32:23.389 --> 32:26.737

32:43.996 --> 32:45.653

33:00.737 --> 33:02.946
Look.

33:10.436 --> 33:13.957
You gotta be kidding me.
It's just a box of microfiche?

33:14.095 --> 33:15.890
I mean,
we knew he was old-school,

33:16.028 --> 33:17.478
but this is ancient.

33:17.616 --> 33:19.238
He must shrink it down
to make it easier to hide.

33:19.376 --> 33:21.413
So how're we gonna copy it?

33:21.551 --> 33:24.588
Uh... there was a scanner
that we passed.

33:24.726 --> 33:26.763
It'll let me dump it
onto a flash drive.

33:26.901 --> 33:28.247
- It's gonna take a while.
- All right.

33:28.385 --> 33:30.560
Then let's get goin'.

33:47.577 --> 33:49.613
Oh, no, no.
But the thing about Lenin

33:49.751 --> 33:51.305
is that he was always
jealous of Trotsky,

33:51.443 --> 33:53.997
because Trotsky
had the gift of gab.

33:54.135 --> 33:57.000
I'm tellin' ya, if the
Astrodome had been around...

33:59.278 --> 34:00.935
Trotsky would've packed it.

34:01.073 --> 34:02.695
He had presence.

34:02.833 --> 34:05.077
Yeah, uh, excuse me
a minute.

34:05.215 --> 34:07.631
<i>Baylor's incoming.
Got about 20 seconds.</i>

34:07.769 --> 34:09.288
I'll distract him.
You keep going.

34:09.426 --> 34:10.979
Hey, Charlie, he's armed.

34:11.118 --> 34:12.912
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
That's why I gotta do this.

35:41.794 --> 35:43.658
That should give you time.

36:12.825 --> 36:17.036
Hey, Bird, Dad,
you guys clear?

36:17.175 --> 36:19.107
<i>Hey, I'm in.
I'm in the van.</i>

36:19.246 --> 36:22.249
Okay. I-- I'll meet you
outside then.

36:22.387 --> 36:24.147
Hey, pal.

36:26.287 --> 36:27.737
Hello again.

36:30.326 --> 36:32.155
I believe you came
to take something of mine,

36:32.293 --> 36:34.261
so I thought
I'd take something of yours.

36:38.955 --> 36:40.301
You know,
there's an easier way

36:40.439 --> 36:41.923
to register for my class.

36:43.477 --> 36:44.443
Let him go.

36:44.581 --> 36:46.756
Who? Your father here?

36:46.894 --> 36:48.792
I thought so.

36:48.930 --> 36:51.036
I take it that was your sister
in my car as well.

36:51.174 --> 36:52.969
Family of criminals.
Holidays must be a delight.

36:53.107 --> 36:55.247
Hey, Pop, Charlie, you keep
him talking, all right?

36:55.385 --> 36:57.284
<i>I'm gonna find us
something we can use.</i>

36:57.422 --> 36:58.837
You calling us criminals?

36:58.975 --> 37:00.839
People pay you
to fix their problems,

37:00.977 --> 37:02.841
an then you steal their secrets
for blackmail?

37:02.979 --> 37:05.084
Cost of doing business;
if my clients really wanted to

37:05.223 --> 37:06.810
protect themselves,
they'd have no secrets.

37:06.948 --> 37:08.709
Everybody's
hiding something, pal.

37:08.847 --> 37:10.573
Except you.

37:10.711 --> 37:12.851
No, someone
spilled your secret.

37:12.989 --> 37:14.991
How's it feel to be disavowed
by your country?

37:15.129 --> 37:17.338
Having my cover blown
left me with nothing to hide.

37:17.476 --> 37:19.823
<i>Unlike you, I have nothing
that makes me vulnerable.</i>

37:19.961 --> 37:21.653
<i>What's your play here?</i>

37:21.791 --> 37:23.827
Steal my collateral
to make a buck?

37:23.965 --> 37:25.312
I'd like to steal
that gun of yours

37:25.450 --> 37:26.416
and stick it up your--

37:26.554 --> 37:28.694
Oh!

37:34.286 --> 37:35.183
You okay?

37:35.322 --> 37:36.564
Yeah.

37:41.362 --> 37:43.330
It's all there.

37:43.468 --> 37:45.780
Even so...

37:45.918 --> 37:49.267
I can't let you out of here
knowing what you know.

37:49.405 --> 37:51.545
<i>Hey, Charlie,
I think I got something.</i>

37:51.683 --> 37:54.202
Those books in Baylor's locker
were written by the wife

37:54.341 --> 37:55.583
<i>of the dean
who blew his cover.</i>

37:55.721 --> 37:58.759
- <i>She's his secret.</i>
- Katherine Moss.

37:58.897 --> 38:00.968
She's the reason
you got burned, right?

38:01.106 --> 38:03.108
You two were having an affair,

38:03.246 --> 38:06.214
and when her husband found out,
he was the one who exposed you.

38:06.353 --> 38:08.355
But you're still carrying
a torch for her.

38:08.493 --> 38:09.873
It's romantic, really.

38:11.047 --> 38:13.774
You think I care about her?

38:13.912 --> 38:16.224
The past is the past.

38:16.363 --> 38:18.365
Then why are you keeping
the books she gave you

38:18.503 --> 38:19.504
in your locker?

38:20.884 --> 38:23.370
Okay, Charlie, I found her.
She lives at 39...

38:23.508 --> 38:25.233
...44 Brandywine.

38:27.028 --> 38:28.720
That's where she lives
with her husband, the dean.

38:28.858 --> 38:31.239
- Right?
- Don't you dare go near her.

38:31.378 --> 38:35.313
As long as you stay clear of
us, she's gonna be fine.

38:35.451 --> 38:38.039
But the second I sniff you
anywhere nearby...

38:40.041 --> 38:41.905
I'm gonna let all
your enemies know

38:42.043 --> 38:44.080
where to find her.

38:47.601 --> 38:49.672
Deal?

39:00.130 --> 39:01.580
Deal.

39:04.169 --> 39:06.274
Good morning, everyone.

39:06.413 --> 39:09.036
I wanted to introduce you
to your new

39:09.174 --> 39:11.452
Director of Social Media,
Jennifer West.

39:11.590 --> 39:13.040
- Hey.
- Hey, Jen.

39:13.178 --> 39:17.596
I have complete faith in Jen,
and I know you all will too.

39:17.734 --> 39:19.391
We need to stop making assumptions

39:19.529 --> 39:22.429
and see each other
for who we really are.

39:22.567 --> 39:23.947
That goes double for voters.

39:24.085 --> 39:27.537
Together, we can bring
real change to Washington.

39:28.987 --> 39:32.266
And let's get to work.

39:40.861 --> 39:42.345
Nice digs.

39:42.483 --> 39:43.967
I know, right?

39:44.105 --> 39:46.556
I acquired it from
some new business partners.

39:46.694 --> 39:48.040
You see, Charlie?

39:48.178 --> 39:50.802
Cooperation has its benefits.

39:50.940 --> 39:52.251
Yeah.

39:54.012 --> 39:55.634
Got you what you needed.

39:58.465 --> 40:00.639
So much power
in the palm of my hand.

40:00.777 --> 40:02.330
This should take off, what,

40:02.469 --> 40:04.850
2 million off your debt,
let's say?

40:04.988 --> 40:06.990
Debt, right.
That's between you and Connor.

40:07.128 --> 40:08.716
You're lucky
I'm feeling generous,

40:08.854 --> 40:10.338
considering
the information on here

40:10.477 --> 40:12.686
solves your problems
as much as mine.

40:12.824 --> 40:15.067
- How would it do that?
- Well,

40:15.205 --> 40:18.001
the feds spotted you
handing stolen cash

40:18.139 --> 40:21.488
to a drug dealer you brought
stateside, so... yes.

40:21.626 --> 40:23.628
You might need
some dirty politicians.

40:25.423 --> 40:27.355
You got a particular
scumbag in mind,

40:27.494 --> 40:29.703
or did you just nearly get
my family and I killed

40:29.841 --> 40:31.187
for a fishing expedition?

40:31.325 --> 40:33.396
All you need to know
is the blackmail on here

40:33.534 --> 40:35.674
will get the feds off
both of our trails for good.

40:39.057 --> 40:41.128
I took care of that
drop car.

40:41.266 --> 40:43.026
All right?
They not on to us anymore.

40:43.164 --> 40:45.891
I don't think you understand
who we're up against.

40:46.029 --> 40:48.687
There's this little
CIA spook--she's smart.

40:48.825 --> 40:51.759
Tenacious.
A real caped crusader.

40:53.727 --> 40:57.075
But lucky for us, her family
isn't quite so principled.

40:57.213 --> 41:00.596
Politicians, am I right?

41:00.734 --> 41:03.219
I bet a threat to her family

41:03.357 --> 41:06.464
will put a nice little dent
in her can-do spirit.

41:14.782 --> 41:15.990
Emma.

41:16.128 --> 41:17.785
What are you doing here?

41:17.923 --> 41:19.580
We need to talk.

41:19.718 --> 41:21.237
Nothing more to say.

41:21.375 --> 41:23.032
Hey, Daphne Finch
is coming for you.

41:26.760 --> 41:28.451
How do you know that name?

41:29.694 --> 41:32.351
Because I'm working for her.

41:33.870 --> 41:36.183
Oh, my God.

41:36.321 --> 41:38.426
It's you--the guy in the mask.

41:38.565 --> 41:40.428
Look, she's got dirt
on your family,

41:40.567 --> 41:43.570
and she intends to use it
against you, Emma.

41:43.708 --> 41:45.572
Why are you telling me this?

41:48.816 --> 41:50.922
Because I love you too.
