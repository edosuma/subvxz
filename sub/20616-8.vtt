WEBVTT

00:10.244 --> 00:12.911
He is <i> pissed,</i>

00:12.913 --> 00:16.215
and he does not want us
to go back here.

00:16.216 --> 00:18.784
He was doing some sort
of witchcraft.

00:18.786 --> 00:22.187
Witchcraft is done,
so it's almost like a curse.

00:22.189 --> 00:24.590
Somebody is on top of me,
choking me.

00:26.127 --> 00:27.960
They felt somebody.

00:27.962 --> 00:31.196
I want to leave.
I just want to move.

00:31.198 --> 00:33.999
I'm panicking.
I want to get out of here.

00:35.169 --> 00:37.002
This is not a good situation.

00:37.004 --> 00:39.204
My name is Amy Allan.

00:39.206 --> 00:40.406
There's death here.

00:40.408 --> 00:42.508
Don't wanna go down there.

00:42.510 --> 00:43.842
I see dead people.

00:43.844 --> 00:45.711
They hide in the walls
and they watch.

00:45.713 --> 00:48.547
I speak to dead people...

00:48.549 --> 00:51.083
She's definitely
a serial killer.

00:51.085 --> 00:52.684
...and they speak to me.

00:52.686 --> 00:55.387
She is going to torture them.

00:55.389 --> 00:58.891
But there's only one way
to know if my findings are real.

00:58.893 --> 01:00.959
They were all murdered.

01:00.961 --> 01:02.561
I rely on my partner.

01:02.563 --> 01:04.062
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

01:04.063 --> 01:05.998
I'm a retired New York City
homicide detective.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.567
So is this the only time
you're been physically attacked?

01:08.569 --> 01:12.504
I know every person,
every house has secrets.

01:12.506 --> 01:16.208
There is no question in my mind
that he was talking about Satan.

01:16.210 --> 01:18.143
It's my job to reveal them.

01:18.145 --> 01:19.678
Who do you think
possessed you?

01:19.680 --> 01:21.513
But Steve and I never speak...

01:21.515 --> 01:23.615
We never communicate
during an investigation.

01:23.617 --> 01:24.850
...until the very end.

01:24.852 --> 01:26.418
Well, you're not gonna want
to see this.

01:26.420 --> 01:28.887
When we uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

01:28.889 --> 01:30.289
<i>Hell,</i> no.

01:30.291 --> 01:31.657
Or time to get out.

01:31.659 --> 01:35.060
Everyone is in jeopardy.

01:37.000 --> 01:43.074

01:45.873 --> 01:47.506
I'm in Murrieta, California.

01:47.508 --> 01:50.142
It's about an hour and a half
in from L.A.

01:50.144 --> 01:54.179
I got a call from a woman
named Lina. Sounds real bad.

01:54.181 --> 01:56.448
She's convinced
whatever's in the house

01:56.450 --> 01:59.485
is going after her husband
and her 15-year-old daughter.

01:59.487 --> 02:01.186
Now, this is a woman
who is religious,

02:01.188 --> 02:03.655
doesn't like to mess around
with the paranormal,

02:03.657 --> 02:06.058
but she's so desperate,
she called us in.

02:06.060 --> 02:08.160
I really hope we can
help her out.

02:10.197 --> 02:12.130
Before Amy arrives,

02:12.132 --> 02:15.534
I clear the area
of any leading information.

02:15.536 --> 02:18.470
This home has
a lot of photographs

02:18.472 --> 02:21.340
and religious symbols,

02:21.342 --> 02:24.176
so it's important that I cover
or remove them all.

02:24.178 --> 02:27.279
When I'm done, the location will
be ready for tonight's walk.

02:41.061 --> 02:42.761
There's so much noise out here.

02:42.763 --> 02:46.064
It's...like, ridiculous.

02:50.104 --> 02:51.470
I don't like it.

02:51.472 --> 02:54.339
It's making me feel
<i>extremely</i> uncomfortable.

02:54.341 --> 02:55.974
I'm panicking.
I don't like this.

02:55.976 --> 02:58.644
I want to run.
I want to get out of here.

02:58.646 --> 03:00.612
This is very bad.

03:09.623 --> 03:11.023
So, Lina,
I'm glad I'm here.

03:11.025 --> 03:14.293
I mean, you sounded really upset
on the phone when we spoke.

03:14.295 --> 03:15.961
Now, what do you think
is here?

03:15.963 --> 03:17.429
I think it's something evil.

03:17.431 --> 03:19.565
Whatever it is,
I think it's something

03:19.567 --> 03:23.835
that is just wanting
to harm my family.

03:23.837 --> 03:25.304
How long have you guys
lived here?

03:25.306 --> 03:26.972
We've been for 11 years.

03:26.974 --> 03:28.941
Now, have you had activity
since the beginning?

03:28.943 --> 03:32.978
We only started having activity
about the last 31/2, 4 years.

03:32.980 --> 03:34.446
You have any theories
as to why?

03:34.448 --> 03:35.948
My husband, we had
an acquaintance

03:35.950 --> 03:39.151
that was dealing with
some occult things,

03:39.153 --> 03:41.553
and my husband
brought something home.

03:41.555 --> 03:42.921
Help me out here.

03:42.923 --> 03:45.691
What exactly do you think
this guy was involved with?

03:45.693 --> 03:48.560
All I know is that
he told my husband

03:48.562 --> 03:51.029
that he was doing
some sort of witchcraft

03:51.031 --> 03:53.565
to become more popular.

03:53.567 --> 03:55.000
Almost like
a deal with the devil.

03:55.002 --> 03:56.134
Yes.

03:56.136 --> 03:57.436
Was your husband involved
in this stuff?

03:57.438 --> 04:01.106
No, but he is
very sensitive.

04:01.108 --> 04:04.142
Okay. So, Lina, who exactly
lives in the house?

04:04.144 --> 04:06.478
- This is my family.
- Okay.

04:06.480 --> 04:08.580
That's my husband, Sal.

04:08.582 --> 04:11.717
my son, Allan, who's 21,

04:11.719 --> 04:13.218
myself,

04:13.220 --> 04:16.188
my daughter, Mei,
who is 20,

04:16.190 --> 04:17.689
and Emily is 15.

04:17.690 --> 04:19.091
All right.
Lina, do me a favor.

04:19.093 --> 04:21.459
Give me an overview of what
you guys are going through.

04:21.462 --> 04:23.528
We've got noises.

04:23.530 --> 04:26.131
We've got things
moving on their own.

04:26.133 --> 04:28.700
We've got physical attacks,

04:28.702 --> 04:31.970
nightmares,
and personality changes.

04:31.972 --> 04:33.338
All right.

04:33.340 --> 04:34.539
Personality changes -- what
are you talking about here?

04:34.541 --> 04:37.542
Mostly in my youngest
daughter and my husband.

04:37.544 --> 04:38.844
Let's start with Sal.

04:38.846 --> 04:40.579
What kind of personality changes
are we talking about?

04:40.581 --> 04:43.215
He'll change from being
normal and happy

04:43.217 --> 04:45.651
to being completely depressed
for no reason.

04:45.653 --> 04:48.120
All right. Now, was he
ever like this before?

04:48.122 --> 04:49.254
- No.
- Okay.

04:49.256 --> 04:51.356
So your daughter Emily,
how has she changed?

04:51.358 --> 04:55.227
With her, it's very severe
anxiety and depression.

04:55.229 --> 04:57.029
She doesn't leave
the house anymore.

04:57.031 --> 04:59.297
It's very hard on her
and myself as well.

04:59.299 --> 05:01.233
How you holding up?

05:01.235 --> 05:04.670
I'm exhausted all the time,
lethargic.

05:04.672 --> 05:06.038
I mean, you break my heart
when I listen to you.

05:06.040 --> 05:08.140
And you have nobody
to turn to?

05:08.142 --> 05:10.842
No. You know, this is
my last resort,

05:10.844 --> 05:15.080
and I want to have my family
whole, back together again.

05:15.082 --> 05:16.481
Okay.

05:18.619 --> 05:20.318
There's these things.

05:20.320 --> 05:24.189
They look like little lizard
gremlin things.

05:24.191 --> 05:25.724
They're running around
and they're, like,

05:25.726 --> 05:28.293
doing this weird...

05:28.295 --> 05:31.163
pitched laughing giggle.

05:33.767 --> 05:36.668
To me, what I'm thinking is that
they're little, like,

05:36.670 --> 05:39.204
low, low, low level demons.

05:39.206 --> 05:44.476
They create an atmosphere
of depression and lethargy.

05:44.478 --> 05:47.045
I don't know why they're
attached to the living here,

05:47.047 --> 05:48.480
but they are.

05:48.482 --> 05:51.783
They just make it impossible
to get anywhere in your life.

05:51.785 --> 05:54.286
It's almost like
they're sent, though.

05:54.288 --> 05:57.622
There might be something behind
that where witchcraft is done,

05:57.624 --> 05:59.591
and so it's almost like a curse.

06:05.833 --> 06:08.400
So, Lina,
what's going on in here?

06:08.402 --> 06:10.936
We've had several
experiences around here.

06:10.938 --> 06:13.305
One of them was
the door here

06:13.307 --> 06:16.108
slammed by itself
very aggressively.

06:16.110 --> 06:18.143
All right. So how hard are
we talking about?

06:18.145 --> 06:20.212
- I mean, did it...
- Very hard.

06:21.482 --> 06:24.549
- Like that?
- Yes, if not harder.

06:24.551 --> 06:27.552
Okay. So you didn't have any
of the windows in here open?

06:27.554 --> 06:29.821
- No.
- All right. Anything else?

06:29.823 --> 06:34.392
I saw a very tall, dark figure
running through our house

06:34.394 --> 06:36.995
from the hallway
into the kitchen

06:36.997 --> 06:39.698
and with very,
very heavy footsteps.

06:39.700 --> 06:40.999
How tall do you think
this thing was?

06:41.001 --> 06:42.501
About 7 to 8 feet tall.

06:42.503 --> 06:44.236
Are you sure it couldn't have
been anything from outside?

06:44.238 --> 06:45.670
No.

06:45.672 --> 06:47.706
So, Lina, obviously,
you cannot go on like this,

06:47.708 --> 06:49.307
you or your family.

06:49.309 --> 06:52.844
I need help, and I want...

06:54.281 --> 06:56.214
It's okay.

06:56.216 --> 06:58.316
You want your family back.

06:58.318 --> 07:00.318
I want them
to be healthy again...

07:00.320 --> 07:02.621
- Okay.
- ...and back to normal.

07:02.623 --> 07:05.357
You've put a lot
on your shoulders.

07:05.359 --> 07:08.226
Hopefully, we'll have tears
of joy when we're done, okay?

07:08.228 --> 07:10.796
I hope so.

07:13.801 --> 07:16.101
Not good. Really not good.

07:16.103 --> 07:18.770
I just saw a body
in the ground here.

07:18.772 --> 07:22.340
I believe that this is...

07:22.342 --> 07:23.575
a female.

07:25.546 --> 07:29.147
There's something with her,

07:29.149 --> 07:30.549
an illness,

07:30.551 --> 07:33.852
and I think that is affecting
the living here.

07:33.854 --> 07:35.854
Do you know how it's
affecting the living?

07:35.856 --> 07:40.725
Sudden onset of nausea,
being extremely drained.

07:40.727 --> 07:44.329
They feel exhausted
all the time

07:44.331 --> 07:48.266
and also, like, this anxiety.

07:48.268 --> 07:50.368
Fear.

07:50.370 --> 07:54.940
She does not like the person
in this room at all.

07:54.942 --> 07:57.609
At all.

07:57.611 --> 07:59.511
Why?

07:59.513 --> 08:04.316
Basically, she's calling
this person a beast.

08:12.492 --> 08:14.426
So, Sal, I was talking
to your wife, Lina,

08:14.428 --> 08:17.128
and she's worried about
your youngest, Emily.

08:17.130 --> 08:19.064
Yeah, she's not doing well.

08:19.066 --> 08:22.868
It's the worst pain, that real
pain in my heart, you know?

08:22.870 --> 08:25.871
Lina, she said that your
personality has changed.

08:25.873 --> 08:27.038
I mean,
you agree with that?

08:27.040 --> 08:30.075
Yes.
I get angry really fast.

08:30.077 --> 08:31.810
I wasn't like that before.

08:31.812 --> 08:36.414
And then anxiety
and then depression,

08:36.416 --> 08:37.782
and it's getting worse.

08:37.784 --> 08:40.418
Sometimes I just cry.

08:40.419 --> 08:42.721
You're going through
a lot, Sal.
Yes.

08:42.722 --> 08:43.922
So, Sal,
I was talking to Lina,

08:43.924 --> 08:46.324
and she has a theory
that about 4 years ago,

08:46.326 --> 08:48.226
you were talking to some guy
that was practicing

08:48.228 --> 08:50.629
some kind of
weird witchcraft.-

08:50.631 --> 08:52.063
And that whatever
he was doing,

08:52.065 --> 08:53.265
something might have
attached to you.

08:53.267 --> 08:54.933
Do you agree with that?

08:54.935 --> 08:59.738
Yeah, because I'm actually
open to that stuff somehow.

08:59.740 --> 09:01.539
I don't know how.

09:01.541 --> 09:03.174
So what about
experiences, Sal?

09:03.176 --> 09:05.577
I have terrible nightmares.

09:05.579 --> 09:07.178
Can you describe them
at all?

09:07.180 --> 09:10.448
I feel like somebody, like,
is, like, on top of me

09:10.450 --> 09:14.319
and won't let me move.

09:14.321 --> 09:17.389
Have you ever been tested
for any kind of sleep disorder?

09:17.391 --> 09:19.324
- No.
- Okay.

09:19.326 --> 09:21.426
To me, it sounds
like sleep paralysis.

09:21.428 --> 09:22.460
But what do you think it is?

09:22.462 --> 09:25.730
I think he is a real devil.

09:25.732 --> 09:27.098
The demon is, like,
on top of me.

09:27.100 --> 09:29.467
He's grabbing me
and choking me.

09:29.469 --> 09:32.070
- Okay.
- So I can die in the nightmare.

09:35.609 --> 09:39.077
The dead girl wants to leave.
She wants out.

09:39.079 --> 09:41.613
This living person is aware

09:41.615 --> 09:45.850
that something paranormal
is trying to kill them.

09:50.057 --> 09:52.657
I know that they felt, you know,

09:52.659 --> 09:56.027
like somebody trying
to strangle them.

09:56.029 --> 09:59.965
I don't think they know that
they're actually not dreaming,

09:59.967 --> 10:01.833
so they are awake.

10:01.835 --> 10:05.136
They're being strangled.
They're being smothered.

10:05.138 --> 10:09.374
The dead girl, she's figuring
out how to...kill this person.

10:30.781 --> 10:33.047
I was talking to Mom and Dad.
You're the oldest, right?

10:33.049 --> 10:34.215
- Yeah.
- How old are you?

10:34.217 --> 10:35.583
21 years old.

10:35.585 --> 10:37.786
Do you have any concern about
dad and your younger sister?

10:37.788 --> 10:41.189
Yeah, they have changed.

10:41.191 --> 10:43.358
They feel so different
and distant.

10:43.360 --> 10:46.227
Everybody seems to be having all
kinds of different experiences.

10:46.229 --> 10:47.796
What about yourself?

10:47.798 --> 10:49.364
I have really bad nightmares.

10:49.366 --> 10:51.666
Now, your father
described nightmares.

10:51.668 --> 10:52.867
Yeah.

10:52.869 --> 10:54.035
Now, what kind of nightmares
are you having?

10:54.037 --> 10:55.503
All of a sudden, something,
whether it be, like,

10:55.505 --> 10:57.038
a person or anything,

10:57.040 --> 10:58.673
it would just become, like,
a dark shadow

10:58.675 --> 11:03.044
that'll eventually become,
like, a human-sized figure.

11:03.046 --> 11:05.713
- But is it threatening to you?
- Yeah.

11:05.715 --> 11:07.649
All right. So anything else?

11:07.651 --> 11:10.652
When I'm sleeping, I'll feel
like something is shaking me,

11:10.654 --> 11:12.687
and I'll wake up
in real life.

11:12.689 --> 11:15.089
Okay. So you're sure
it's not a dream,

11:15.091 --> 11:16.357
or do you think you're being
really physically shaken?

11:16.359 --> 11:17.859
I'm being really
physically shaken,

11:17.861 --> 11:19.461
and it'll feel like
a shake enough

11:19.463 --> 11:21.563
to where
it will move me back.

11:21.565 --> 11:23.264
What do you think
is going on?

11:23.266 --> 11:24.933
I feel like whatever is
happening is kind of trying

11:24.935 --> 11:26.301
to divide my family,

11:26.303 --> 11:28.203
at least when it comes to my dad
and my youngest sister.

11:28.205 --> 11:30.438
They're like two different
versions of people

11:30.440 --> 11:32.273
that I used to know.

11:32.275 --> 11:33.741
Okay.

11:33.743 --> 11:41.015
I'm seeing, like,
this angry dead man, old,

11:41.017 --> 11:44.519
and he is...pissed.

11:47.190 --> 11:50.325
and he does not
want us to go back here.

11:50.327 --> 11:52.327
He doesn't like living people.

11:52.329 --> 11:54.329
He hates this...family.

11:54.331 --> 11:57.565
They don't respect him.
They all deserve what they get.

12:00.170 --> 12:01.402
Okay.

12:01.404 --> 12:03.404
So I'm seeing kind of
a weird thing here.

12:03.406 --> 12:06.875
So I'm seeing a person
laying in the bed.

12:06.877 --> 12:10.979
It's a male, probably anywhere
from, like, 15 to 21.

12:10.981 --> 12:16.217
The little old man
is on top of this male.

12:16.219 --> 12:18.419
There is some sketchy...
going on here.

12:24.694 --> 12:27.562
Seems like there is a lot
of things going on in the house.

12:27.564 --> 12:29.197
Have you had any experiences?

12:29.199 --> 12:33.167
Yeah, I always hear
running along the roof.

12:33.169 --> 12:35.737
- Does it sound like an animal?
- No.

12:35.739 --> 12:40.208
It sounds like a person
with really heavy shoes.

12:40.210 --> 12:41.676
Okay. So anything else?

12:41.678 --> 12:45.914
I have been felt like
I'm being watched all the time.

12:45.916 --> 12:47.615
Where do you feel it?

12:47.617 --> 12:50.084
Usually sleeping, and then
I'll randomly get up

12:50.086 --> 12:52.387
and, like, look at
every corner of my room,

12:52.389 --> 12:54.889
and I'll feel, like,
a really heavy stare on me.

12:54.891 --> 12:57.258
But does it feel like somebody
that wants to do you harm?

12:57.260 --> 12:58.493
Yeah.

12:59.896 --> 13:01.796
This is the worst room.

13:01.798 --> 13:05.433
It's interesting,
with the curtains.

13:05.435 --> 13:08.002
Literally, like,
a doorway for the dead,

13:08.004 --> 13:11.472
coming and going,
coming and going.

13:11.474 --> 13:15.877
So this person, definitely
a medium, without a doubt.

13:15.879 --> 13:18.346
They're getting bad,
crazy-ass dead people.

13:18.348 --> 13:20.848
I do think that they would
cause this person

13:20.850 --> 13:23.585
to feel overwhelmed and sad.

13:26.523 --> 13:29.891
Your mom called us in, and she's
really concerned about you.

13:29.893 --> 13:33.494
She thinks you've
changed emotionally.

13:33.496 --> 13:34.996
- Yeah.
- Do you agree with that?

13:34.998 --> 13:36.998
- Yes.
- What's going on?

13:37.000 --> 13:39.100
I have anxiety and depression,

13:39.102 --> 13:42.203
and, like, ever since
the activity started,

13:42.205 --> 13:44.005
I never want to leave
the house.

13:44.007 --> 13:45.673
That's not really normal
for a 15-year-old.

13:45.675 --> 13:47.642
- You know that, right?
- Yeah.

13:47.644 --> 13:49.410
Is it affecting you
physically, too?

13:49.412 --> 13:52.213
Yes, I am really drained
of my energy.

13:52.215 --> 13:54.449
Sometimes I'll stand up
and I'll, like,

13:54.451 --> 13:57.418
see black for, like, a minute.

13:57.420 --> 13:59.687
If we can figure out a way
to fix whatever the hell

13:59.689 --> 14:01.456
is going on here,

14:01.458 --> 14:03.758
would you want to stay,
or do you still want to go?

14:03.760 --> 14:05.293
I want to leave.

14:05.295 --> 14:08.396
I just want to move away
from this property.

14:08.398 --> 14:10.198
Okay. That's sad, honey.

14:12.836 --> 14:17.905
One of the things that
I'm getting about this area,

14:17.907 --> 14:21.275
and then specifically now,
this room,

14:21.277 --> 14:24.145
is these tall beings,

14:24.147 --> 14:27.382
that are ancient.

14:27.384 --> 14:30.752
They were here before man,

14:30.754 --> 14:37.859
and the dead were talking
about them coming from the sky,

14:37.861 --> 14:41.229
and so that does make me
think that these are aliens.

14:43.099 --> 14:45.133
I see them coming in

14:45.135 --> 14:48.736
and abducting people
in this house.

14:48.738 --> 14:51.439
How might they be affected
by that?

14:51.441 --> 14:53.141
Irrational fears.

14:53.143 --> 14:57.245
Most abductees have issues with
certain noises and frequencies,

14:57.247 --> 15:00.682
sleep issues, nightmares.

15:00.684 --> 15:03.317
And the harm it can do, I think,

15:03.319 --> 15:04.919
to a person physically
and mentally

15:04.921 --> 15:07.522
and emotionally
is pretty severe.

15:24.748 --> 15:27.115
Sal is such a sweet
and sincere guy,

15:27.117 --> 15:30.452
and I know he believes his
nightmares and sleep paralysis

15:30.454 --> 15:32.354
come from the paranormal.

15:32.356 --> 15:33.789
But I called a local doctor,

15:33.791 --> 15:37.759
and he says it could just be
symptoms of sleep apnea.

15:37.761 --> 15:39.795
So I had Sal do a home test.

15:39.797 --> 15:42.397
He put on this contraption,
went to sleep wearing it,

15:42.399 --> 15:45.000
and all the data was recorded.

15:45.002 --> 15:46.902
Right now, I'm heading over
to meet that doctor

15:46.904 --> 15:48.770
to go over these test results.

15:55.646 --> 15:57.712
Well, Doctor, I appreciate
you meeting with me.

15:57.714 --> 16:01.883
So my client is suffering from
nightmares and sleep paralysis.

16:01.885 --> 16:04.953
Now you mentioned sleep apnea
could be the cause of this?

16:04.955 --> 16:06.988
What are the other
symptoms of that?

16:06.990 --> 16:09.791
It can cause insomnia,
fatigue,

16:09.793 --> 16:11.693
mood swings and depression.

16:11.695 --> 16:13.528
Okay. Now, would he feel like
he was being choked?

16:13.530 --> 16:15.230
Sometimes people feel like
they're gasping.

16:15.232 --> 16:16.665
They can't get enough air,

16:16.667 --> 16:17.999
and they'll wake up...

16:18.001 --> 16:20.001
feeling like they're choking.

16:20.003 --> 16:22.871
If this goes on for a long
time, what could happen?

16:22.873 --> 16:24.940
Typically, that's going
to be hypertension,

16:24.942 --> 16:27.909
high blood pressure,
sometimes heart failure.

16:27.911 --> 16:31.046
So, Doc, I know you normally
test people here at your office,

16:31.048 --> 16:35.417
but my client slept with this
contraption at home last night.

16:35.419 --> 16:37.219
So you had a chance
to look at the results?

16:37.221 --> 16:38.820
- Yes.
- All right, Doc.

16:38.822 --> 16:40.222
So what are we looking
at here?

16:40.224 --> 16:42.357
So what we're looking at
is breathing pattern up here.

16:42.359 --> 16:44.593
All right. So does this mean
he has sleep apnea?

16:44.595 --> 16:47.128
It does not appear to be
sleep apnea at all.

16:47.130 --> 16:49.965
So all the symptoms he's got
as far as nightmares,

16:49.967 --> 16:51.933
the feeling of being choked,
depression,

16:51.935 --> 16:54.402
all this other stuff, it's not
coming from any sleep disorder?

16:54.404 --> 16:57.172
It doesn't seem like it's coming
from obstructive sleep apnea.

16:57.174 --> 16:59.641
Okay.

16:59.643 --> 17:01.943
I'm seeing
the dead girl again.

17:01.945 --> 17:05.213
I don't think the living
can sleep while she's around.

17:05.214 --> 17:07.482
I think that they're aware
enough that they know

17:07.483 --> 17:10.484
that something really bad
actually is happening.

17:13.490 --> 17:15.957
I think they're like,
"No," you know,

17:15.959 --> 17:18.126
"that was just a dream,"
but they are fighting it.

17:18.127 --> 17:19.261
They're fighting it.

17:19.262 --> 17:21.229
Something weird's going on.

17:25.569 --> 17:27.167
So I made my usual calls,

17:27.170 --> 17:29.337
and this local historian
reached out to tell me

17:29.339 --> 17:32.474
the Native Americans
got a raw deal in this city.

17:32.476 --> 17:34.809
Listen, I hear that
pretty much everywhere we go,

17:34.811 --> 17:36.444
but she says this is different.

17:36.446 --> 17:38.113
There were two major incidents,

17:38.115 --> 17:40.315
and one of them involved
the original owner

17:40.317 --> 17:42.117
of Sal and Lina's property.

17:46.356 --> 17:47.989
What can you tell me
about the Native Americans

17:47.991 --> 17:49.357
that inhabited the land here?

17:49.359 --> 17:50.559
'Cause I know we're close
to my clients' property.

17:50.561 --> 17:52.694
Yeah, they were the Luiseños,

17:52.696 --> 17:54.496
and they lived here
hundreds of years

17:54.498 --> 17:59.067
before the Spanish settlers
came in the mid-1800s.

17:59.069 --> 18:00.435
You mentioned on the phone
there were two incidents

18:00.437 --> 18:01.503
involving
the Native Americans.

18:01.505 --> 18:02.871
What's the first one?

18:02.873 --> 18:05.941
Well, the first one is,
the Luiseños had some horses,

18:05.943 --> 18:09.210
and there were Spanish settlers
called Californios

18:09.212 --> 18:11.780
that came in
and stole their horses.

18:11.782 --> 18:13.181
Okay.

18:13.183 --> 18:14.749
The Luiseños took the law
into their own hands

18:14.751 --> 18:18.453
and killed all 11
of the Californios,

18:18.455 --> 18:21.122
along with
a 13-year-old boy.

18:21.124 --> 18:22.490
- Over horses?
- Yes.

18:22.492 --> 18:25.327
All right. So did
the Californios get any revenge?

18:25.329 --> 18:27.062
Yeah.
They were furious.

18:27.064 --> 18:29.431
So what they did is,
they set up an ambush,

18:29.433 --> 18:31.900
and from that,
they massacred them all.

18:31.902 --> 18:33.134
How many of these guys
did they kill?

18:33.136 --> 18:34.202
About 38 to 40.

18:34.204 --> 18:35.937
All right.
So that's a lot of bodies.

18:35.939 --> 18:37.505
Did they just
leave them there?

18:37.507 --> 18:41.443
This is why I brought you here,
because they had a mass grave,

18:41.445 --> 18:43.511
and they buried them
somewhere over here.

18:43.513 --> 18:44.946
- By the shopping mall?
- Yes.

18:44.948 --> 18:47.248
All right. So did they
at least dig up the bodies,

18:47.250 --> 18:49.751
or did they
just build over it?

18:49.753 --> 18:51.386
They just built
right over it.

18:54.558 --> 18:58.426
There are
a lot of dead people here,

18:58.428 --> 19:01.162
just wandering the streets.

19:01.164 --> 19:05.734
There were three
or four places of burial,

19:05.736 --> 19:08.603
and I think that
all of these burial areas

19:08.605 --> 19:10.538
were from different
time periods,

19:10.540 --> 19:13.541
like, 1600s, 1700s.

19:13.543 --> 19:16.411
These areas where bodies
were placed

19:16.413 --> 19:20.181
that were just ignored
and built upon,

19:20.183 --> 19:21.950
and so they're not at rest,

19:21.952 --> 19:24.152
and they haven't
ever been at rest.

19:24.154 --> 19:26.321
These dead people are
kind of pissed about it.

19:26.323 --> 19:27.555
They're not happy.

19:27.557 --> 19:29.691
All right, Yvette,
you mentioned on the phone

19:29.693 --> 19:31.026
there was a second incident

19:31.028 --> 19:32.961
that involved the original owner
of my clients' property.

19:32.963 --> 19:35.530
- Who was this guy?
- His name was Juan Murrieta,

19:35.532 --> 19:37.966
and they actually named
this town after him.

19:37.968 --> 19:40.502
Okay.
He was born and raised
in Spain,

19:40.504 --> 19:44.105
and he arrived here
in California in 1861.

19:44.107 --> 19:48.576
Here is a picture of him
when he was in his early 30s,

19:48.578 --> 19:52.681
and then here's another photo
when he was in his 80s.

19:52.683 --> 19:55.550
All right. So what did he
wind up doing with the property?

19:55.552 --> 19:57.886
He ended up raising sheep
on the property,

19:57.888 --> 20:01.022
and he built this house
on the property.

20:01.024 --> 20:02.757
Okay. So you said
there was an incident

20:02.759 --> 20:04.926
with the Native Americans.
What happened?

20:04.928 --> 20:08.363
Murrieta's sheep were getting
into the Luiseños lands

20:08.365 --> 20:10.365
and eating up
the crops and whatnot,

20:10.367 --> 20:12.801
and so they got into
an argument.

20:12.803 --> 20:14.135
Okay.
So what did Murrieta do?

20:14.137 --> 20:17.072
Well, Murrieta decided
to evict them,

20:17.074 --> 20:20.041
and here is their decree
right here.

20:20.043 --> 20:21.810
Okay. So he throws them off
the property?

20:21.812 --> 20:23.044
How many?

20:23.046 --> 20:25.246
- There were 200.
- What happened after that?

20:25.248 --> 20:28.116
They were living in squalor
for at least 7 years,

20:28.118 --> 20:30.985
and many of them
were starving and dying.

20:30.987 --> 20:32.487
So this guy Murrieta
from the photo

20:32.489 --> 20:33.755
looks like he lived
a long time.

20:33.757 --> 20:37.092
Yes, he died in 1936
at the age of 91.

20:37.094 --> 20:39.728
- He died a rich man.
- Guy's a real piece of work.

20:41.965 --> 20:44.599
I'm seeing
the angry old man again.

20:44.601 --> 20:48.002
Do you have any idea
who this person was in life?

20:48.004 --> 20:50.872
He was not born
in California,

20:50.874 --> 20:52.974
so I think he does speak
another language.

20:52.976 --> 20:55.143
I think he did come from Mexico.

20:55.145 --> 20:59.180
He was more than likely
pretty poor,

20:59.182 --> 21:02.784
and then he either came into
money or made his own money,

21:02.786 --> 21:06.087
and he's showing me animals
that he had or something.

21:09.926 --> 21:11.893
He thinks it's his house.

21:11.895 --> 21:14.696
"These people need to go.
This is my house.

21:14.698 --> 21:16.264
Everybody stole it from me."

21:16.266 --> 21:18.366
He's just going nuts.

21:22.405 --> 21:24.773
He's crazy.

21:50.717 --> 21:52.517
So far I have a family
living in the middle

21:52.519 --> 21:54.486
of a paranormal war zone

21:54.488 --> 21:56.955
on a property where
Native Americans were abused,

21:56.957 --> 22:00.058
neglected, and killed.

22:00.060 --> 22:03.828
But I want to see what else
happened here.

22:03.830 --> 22:05.130
Searching through old records,

22:05.132 --> 22:06.898
I find an article
about a young girl

22:06.900 --> 22:11.069
who was brutally murdered
in 1996.

22:11.071 --> 22:13.304
Turns out the homicide
took place less than a mile

22:13.306 --> 22:17.609
from my clients' property.

22:17.611 --> 22:19.677
All right, I called the cops
about this homicide,

22:19.679 --> 22:21.446
but they said they don't want
to talk to me about it

22:21.448 --> 22:24.416
because one of the suspects
is still on the loose.

22:24.418 --> 22:27.385
So I'm meeting with a true crime
author who says this murder

22:27.387 --> 22:29.254
was one of
the most savage crimes

22:29.256 --> 22:31.523
in Murrieta's history.

22:38.098 --> 22:41.065
So, Aleida, thanks for
helping me out with this case.

22:41.067 --> 22:42.300
Before we get to
the homicide,

22:42.302 --> 22:43.501
what do we know
about this victim?

22:43.503 --> 22:45.770
Well, her name
was Sophia Briseno.

22:45.772 --> 22:47.739
She was only 13 years old.

22:47.741 --> 22:50.241
She lived only about
900 feet from the property

22:50.243 --> 22:51.609
that you're investigating,

22:51.611 --> 22:54.946
and she had a boyfriend that
she'd been secretly dating.

22:54.948 --> 22:56.314
He was 17 years old.

22:56.316 --> 22:59.684
His name was
Crispin Solorio Garcia.

22:59.686 --> 23:01.019
All right.
So what happened?

23:01.021 --> 23:05.590
Well, on February 12th of 1996,
Garcia calls Sophia,

23:05.592 --> 23:09.461
and he asked her to meet him
at this local grocery store.

23:09.463 --> 23:11.262
And so she meets him there,

23:11.264 --> 23:14.966
and he is there with his
friend, Francisco Ochoa.

23:14.968 --> 23:16.167
Okay.

23:16.169 --> 23:18.436
Well, they all went
to a local cemetery,

23:18.438 --> 23:21.739
which is a place that a lot
of the kids would party at.

23:21.741 --> 23:24.843
And I actually have a picture
here of the cemetery.

23:27.214 --> 23:29.981
- I mean, a cemetery, really?
- A cemetery.

23:29.983 --> 23:32.550
So, Aleida, how far is this
cemetery from my clients' house?

23:32.552 --> 23:34.586
It's only about 2,400 feet.

23:34.588 --> 23:38.256
Okay. So they're there partying.
How'd it go bad?

23:38.258 --> 23:41.226
Well, Sophia started
irritating Garcia.

23:41.228 --> 23:44.963
He gets upset, and he
tells her to shut up.

23:44.965 --> 23:46.798
"Just shut up,
or I'm gonna kill you."

23:46.800 --> 23:48.833
At this point,
Sophia doesn't stop.

23:48.835 --> 23:52.637
She keeps going, and, according
to the police, he tells Ochoa,

23:52.639 --> 23:55.240
"Go to my truck
and get some screwdrivers."

23:55.242 --> 23:56.975
Garcia takes a screwdriver

23:56.977 --> 24:00.111
and he just starts
to viciously stab Sophia,

24:00.113 --> 24:02.580
and as he's stabbing her,
he shouts at her,

24:02.582 --> 24:05.049
"Do you believe me now...
that I'm gonna kill you?"

24:08.522 --> 24:11.523
This dead girl is in
so much pain.

24:11.525 --> 24:14.659
Did you get anymore
information on her life?

24:14.661 --> 24:17.862
I know that she was young.
She had black hair.

24:17.864 --> 24:21.432
There's something
with her jaw...

24:23.737 --> 24:27.605
...with how she died. It hurts.

24:27.607 --> 24:29.374
And then her back.

24:32.546 --> 24:35.280
Okay. So this is
a pretty savage attack.

24:35.282 --> 24:37.682
I mean, when all is said
and done, what was the damage?

24:37.684 --> 24:40.084
Well, she was stabbed
64 times.

24:40.086 --> 24:43.488
She was stabbed in the chest,
in her face, in her jaw,

24:43.490 --> 24:46.057
in her neck,
in her head, in her back.

24:46.059 --> 24:48.026
I mean, she was
just stabbed everywhere.

24:48.028 --> 24:51.329
And I actually have
her death certificate here.

24:51.331 --> 24:54.065
These guys are animals.
I mean, real savages.

24:54.067 --> 24:56.401
- Absolutely.
- What do they do next?

24:56.403 --> 24:59.938
Well, they just leave her body
there to rot, out in the open.

24:59.940 --> 25:02.307
The day before Sophia's body
is actually found,

25:02.309 --> 25:03.641
they flee to Mexico.

25:03.643 --> 25:05.710
I know one guy was
apprehended. What happened?

25:05.712 --> 25:09.514
So in 2007,
the FBI locates Garcia.

25:09.516 --> 25:11.983
He's extradited
back to the United States

25:11.985 --> 25:13.885
and then he stands trial
for her murder.

25:13.887 --> 25:17.989
This is actually
his mug shot.

25:17.991 --> 25:20.358
He is convicted
of first-degree murder

25:20.360 --> 25:22.627
and sentenced
to 25 years to life.

25:22.629 --> 25:25.096
He is incarcerated
in California.

25:25.098 --> 25:26.631
And what about Ochoa?

25:26.633 --> 25:28.566
Well, Ochoa has
never been caught.

25:28.568 --> 25:30.668
He's still out there.

25:35.508 --> 25:36.941
All I know
about this dead chick

25:36.943 --> 25:39.877
is that she definitely
was murdered.

25:42.716 --> 25:44.882
It was fairly recently.

25:44.884 --> 25:46.918
When would you say then?

25:46.920 --> 25:51.322
I would say
maybe the 1970s, 1980s,

25:51.324 --> 25:53.725
could be even closer than that.

25:55.695 --> 25:59.664
Was her body literally,
literally here?

25:59.666 --> 26:02.800
She doesn't know.
So she died in the ground?

26:02.802 --> 26:06.471
So she's showing me
she's in the ground, right?

26:06.473 --> 26:08.539
Now she's looking at her body.

26:08.541 --> 26:09.874
She's naked.

26:09.876 --> 26:12.010
Her hair is all wet,
caked with mud, you know?

26:12.012 --> 26:15.780
And she's looking at herself,
and then she's lifting up,

26:15.782 --> 26:17.115
and she's in the house.

26:19.886 --> 26:21.519
And that's the last
she remembers.

26:30.930 --> 26:33.064
There is a lot of activity
in this house,

26:33.066 --> 26:35.733
but one of the things
I'm really worried about

26:35.735 --> 26:38.836
is the pathway of dead
in one of the bedrooms.

26:38.838 --> 26:42.774
The dead that I saw,
they were translucent.

26:42.776 --> 26:45.777
They did have, like,
little wispy arms.

26:45.779 --> 26:48.079
And they were
all over the place.

26:53.253 --> 26:56.487
Amy, is this what you saw?

26:56.489 --> 26:57.789
Yes.

27:16.785 --> 27:19.619
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

27:19.621 --> 27:21.754
we're ready to reveal
our findings to each other

27:21.756 --> 27:24.290
and our clients
for the first time

27:24.292 --> 27:27.226
Well, Amy, you're looking across
at a family in crisis.

27:27.228 --> 27:28.461
This is Sal.

27:28.463 --> 27:31.998
This is his wife, Lina,
and their son, Allen.

27:32.000 --> 27:34.133
They also have
two other daughters.

27:34.135 --> 27:37.837
This is Mei, who is 20,
and this is Emily, who is 15.

27:37.839 --> 27:40.673
Now everyone is having
experiences, but Sal and Emily

27:40.675 --> 27:42.141
are getting the worst of it.

27:42.143 --> 27:44.076
They brought us in to stop
whatever's here

27:44.078 --> 27:45.478
before someone gets hurt,

27:45.480 --> 27:48.414
and so they can go back to being
a loving and caring family.

27:48.416 --> 27:51.250
So now that Amy knows
a little bit about you guys,

27:51.252 --> 27:52.919
I'll ask her to describe
her walk for us.

27:55.623 --> 27:58.157
When I got here,

27:58.159 --> 28:01.260
I saw these little things.

28:01.262 --> 28:04.864
They kind of looked like a cross
between a lizard and a gremlin.

28:04.866 --> 28:06.632
There was about 12 of 'em.

28:06.634 --> 28:09.402
They have little tails
and little horns.

28:09.404 --> 28:13.439
What these things are,
are, like, low-level demons.

28:13.441 --> 28:16.108
The things that they can
cause are, like,

28:16.110 --> 28:18.077
feelings of depression,

28:18.079 --> 28:21.214
feelings of being
completely overwhelmed.

28:21.216 --> 28:25.518
They also can make you feel like
you're not succeeding in life.

28:25.520 --> 28:28.688
Sal, why don't we start with you
and talk about the anxiety,

28:28.690 --> 28:30.923
the negative thoughts,
the depression?

28:30.925 --> 28:34.527
It's been, like, 4 years
since this happening to me.

28:34.529 --> 28:36.062
That makes me really sad.

28:36.064 --> 28:40.933
That's where I'm getting all
my anxiety and my depression.

28:40.935 --> 28:44.303
The thing is, is that
these things are summoned.

28:44.305 --> 28:46.572
I got that someone
practicing witchcraft

28:46.574 --> 28:48.908
brought them here
as a curse.

28:48.910 --> 28:50.343
Now, Lina, do me a favor.

28:50.345 --> 28:53.145
I want to you to tell Amy what
you think, how this all started.

28:53.147 --> 28:57.783
I suspect that Sal brought
something home with him

28:57.785 --> 28:59.151
on one occasion.

28:59.153 --> 29:01.187
He had an acquaintance
that was dealing

29:01.189 --> 29:04.357
with some sort of
witchcraft.

29:04.359 --> 29:06.225
He started having
nightmares that night,

29:06.227 --> 29:10.129
woke up crying and just
hysterical that night,

29:10.131 --> 29:14.567
and that's the point in time
where all of this started.

29:14.569 --> 29:16.702
Now, is that what you think
may have caused all this?

29:16.704 --> 29:19.605
Yeah.

29:19.607 --> 29:21.841
So do you think this guy
put a curse on Sal?

29:21.843 --> 29:23.476
Yeah.

29:23.478 --> 29:25.311
I think that this
person got offended

29:25.313 --> 29:26.612
that you were judging him.

29:26.614 --> 29:28.347
I'm not surprised.

29:28.349 --> 29:30.449
Sal, don't talk
to this other guy anymore.

29:30.451 --> 29:32.184
- No.
- I will not.

29:32.186 --> 29:35.588
'Cause that guy needs a beat.

29:35.590 --> 29:37.290
All right, so what else?

29:37.292 --> 29:42.261
The next thing that I saw was
this dead woman in that bedroom.

29:42.263 --> 29:44.797
Okay. So that's
Sal and Lina's bedroom.

29:44.799 --> 29:47.199
I got that she was, like,
keeping you awake at night,

29:47.201 --> 29:49.635
not letting you
have peaceful sleep.

29:49.637 --> 29:51.604
I think
she does cause nausea.

29:51.606 --> 29:54.740
She also makes you feel
very tired.

29:54.742 --> 29:57.143
She's extremely draining.

29:57.145 --> 30:01.380
I feel the feeling of drain,
like you were explaining,

30:01.382 --> 30:02.949
that I'm always exhausted.

30:02.951 --> 30:05.351
I think that you've woken up
and been, like,

30:05.353 --> 30:08.187
feeling like you're having
a heart attack.

30:08.189 --> 30:09.689
Maybe you were trying
to just be like,

30:09.691 --> 30:11.157
"No, these are
just nightmares,

30:11.159 --> 30:13.960
and this isn't really
happening," and, you know,

30:13.962 --> 30:16.028
but it really is happening.

30:16.030 --> 30:19.065
Everything you're describing
is what Sal's going through.

30:19.067 --> 30:20.600
Really?

30:20.602 --> 30:22.234
Sal, do me a favor
and describe

30:22.236 --> 30:24.270
the nightmares
that you're having.

30:24.272 --> 30:27.239
When I was sleeping,
this man attacked me.

30:27.241 --> 30:32.111
I feel him, that he is on top
of me, and then he's choking me,

30:32.113 --> 30:35.448
and then he doesn't me--
to move at all.

30:35.450 --> 30:37.516
I start crying.

30:37.518 --> 30:39.352
It feels really horrible.

30:39.354 --> 30:41.087
Now, when Sal told me
what he was going through,

30:41.089 --> 30:43.089
I thought it might
have been sleep apnea,

30:43.091 --> 30:44.557
so I called a local doctor,

30:44.559 --> 30:47.960
who said that condition could
cause those kinds of symptoms,

30:47.962 --> 30:49.695
including depression.

30:49.697 --> 30:51.797
So I had Sal tested.

30:51.799 --> 30:54.667
The results came back,

30:54.669 --> 30:56.769
and everything was negative.

30:58.706 --> 31:00.339
You don't have sleep apnea, Sal.

31:00.341 --> 31:04.677
Unfortunately, there's gotta be
another explanation for it.

31:04.679 --> 31:05.845
Any idea about this dead girl,

31:05.847 --> 31:07.179
or who she was
or anything like that?

31:07.181 --> 31:09.181
I got that
she was pretty young.

31:09.183 --> 31:12.918
What I saw of her was that
she was kind of, like,

31:12.920 --> 31:14.887
a little bit caked in mud,

31:14.889 --> 31:19.258
and she was nude, and that
she had long dark hair.

31:19.260 --> 31:21.827
Just, like, a lot of jaw pain,

31:21.829 --> 31:25.531
and her back was
excruciating pain.

31:25.533 --> 31:28.034
I know that she was
caught off guard.

31:28.036 --> 31:30.336
She was definitely murdered.

31:30.338 --> 31:33.272
I was getting, like, maybe it
happened in the '70s or '80s,

31:33.274 --> 31:36.142
or she might have been born
in the '70s and '80s

31:36.144 --> 31:38.911
'cause it could've happened
even more recently.

31:38.913 --> 31:40.946
A few things you said remind me

31:40.948 --> 31:43.315
of a pretty gruesome homicide
I came across.

31:43.317 --> 31:46.318
Now the victim's name
was Sophia Briseno.

31:46.320 --> 31:49.121
She lived in Murrieta,
about 900 feet from this house.

31:49.123 --> 31:50.589
She was only 13.

31:50.591 --> 31:54.660
She was secretly dating a boy
named Crispin Solorio Garcia.

31:54.662 --> 31:59.565
This kid was 17,
and on February 12, 1996,

31:59.567 --> 32:02.001
Garcia invited Sophia
to meet with him

32:02.003 --> 32:03.402
at a market in Murrieta.

32:03.404 --> 32:04.937
Now Garcia was also
with a friend

32:04.939 --> 32:07.139
named Francisco Gonzalez Ochoa,

32:07.141 --> 32:09.408
and then they headed
to that nearby cemetery.

32:09.410 --> 32:10.776
At the time, it was a place

32:10.778 --> 32:14.213
where teenagers would
hang out and party.

32:14.215 --> 32:16.515
Sophia started to get
on Garcia's nerves.

32:16.517 --> 32:17.783
Garcia told her to shut up,

32:17.785 --> 32:19.151
and she started
making fun of him.

32:19.153 --> 32:21.287
Next thing you know, Garcia got
ahold of a screwdriver

32:21.289 --> 32:23.622
and began stabbing her.

32:23.624 --> 32:26.592
Now you said the girl was
in pain in her jaw and her back.

32:26.594 --> 32:29.361
Well, this bastard
stabbed her 64 times...

32:29.363 --> 32:30.629
My goodness.

32:30.631 --> 32:34.433
...all around her face,
her neck, her back.

32:34.435 --> 32:36.102
Now he basically left her
in the cemetery to rot

32:36.104 --> 32:37.870
because they didn't find her
for 6 days.

32:37.872 --> 32:39.772
No.

32:39.774 --> 32:42.374
The two of them
then took off for Mexico.

32:42.376 --> 32:45.778
Garcia was finally caught
and extradited in 2007.

32:45.780 --> 32:49.115
He's doing life now, and I got
a mug shot of this psycho.

32:49.117 --> 32:51.984
This is Garcia right here.

32:51.986 --> 32:55.855
Unfortunately, Ochoa is
still on the loose.

32:55.857 --> 32:57.456
I feel horrible that
that happened to her,

32:57.458 --> 33:01.026
but I can't forgive her for
what she's doing to my family.

33:01.028 --> 33:02.995
I feel so much anger.

33:05.233 --> 33:07.500
All right.
So what else do we have?

33:07.502 --> 33:10.870
I encountered
an angry old man,

33:10.872 --> 33:15.174
and I do believe
that he is a big problem.

33:15.176 --> 33:18.511
He kept claiming that
this was his house,

33:18.513 --> 33:21.781
and he wants to push the living
out so he can be alone.

33:21.783 --> 33:24.183
I know he can
move objects around.

33:24.185 --> 33:27.019
I felt like the living would
more than likely see him

33:27.021 --> 33:29.688
as a type of shadow person.

33:29.690 --> 33:32.124
We see this shadow thing
running from that living room,

33:32.126 --> 33:34.894
straight through here,
back in through the kitchen,

33:34.896 --> 33:36.662
toward the pantry.

33:36.664 --> 33:41.467
I saw him often in
the middle bedroom, I think.

33:41.469 --> 33:42.935
That's Allan's room.

33:42.937 --> 33:45.304
I got that he was bothering
a young male

33:45.306 --> 33:47.640
between 15 and 21 years
of age.

33:47.642 --> 33:49.008
Allan's 21.

33:49.010 --> 33:51.177
I saw the male
laying on the bed,

33:51.179 --> 33:54.246
and I saw him
on top of that male,

33:54.248 --> 33:56.015
and I did see
the young male, like,

33:56.017 --> 33:59.885
freaking out and struggling
and trying to get away.

33:59.887 --> 34:01.187
In the nightmares that I have,

34:01.189 --> 34:03.289
I'll feel like I'm being
moved in the dream,

34:03.291 --> 34:06.392
only to find that I'm being
waken up or shaken in real life.

34:06.394 --> 34:08.828
So him feeling like somebody
is actually shaking him

34:08.830 --> 34:12.531
is actually happening?
- Yes.

34:12.533 --> 34:13.699
Who was he?
Do you have any idea?

34:13.701 --> 34:17.203
I got that
he was in his 70s.

34:17.205 --> 34:19.103
He was not born
in the U.S.

34:19.106 --> 34:21.639
I believe he was Mexican,
but I wasn't sure.

34:21.641 --> 34:24.510
I got that initially
he was very poor

34:24.512 --> 34:25.945
and that he either
came into money

34:25.947 --> 34:28.214
or he made his own money,
and he's pissed off

34:28.216 --> 34:31.884
because he felt like
everybody stole from him.

34:31.886 --> 34:36.455
I know that he had quite a few
animals when he was alive,

34:36.456 --> 34:39.058
but now he thinks
that he owns this house

34:39.060 --> 34:42.027
because he owned the land.

34:42.029 --> 34:43.362
But things are confusing

34:43.364 --> 34:46.031
'cause they're not exactly
how they used to be.

34:46.033 --> 34:47.699
I think I know who
you're talking about.

34:47.702 --> 34:49.034
His name was Juan Murrieta.

34:49.036 --> 34:50.902
You know, they named
the town after this guy.

34:50.905 --> 34:54.505
Juan was born and raised in
Spain, but he came here in 1861,

34:54.507 --> 34:57.309
and he bought this property
in 1873.

34:57.311 --> 34:59.745
He lived here, but obviously
in a different structure.

34:59.747 --> 35:03.382
I actually have a photo
of his house.

35:03.384 --> 35:05.551
He came from a pretty modest
background, this guy,

35:05.553 --> 35:06.919
but he ended up
making a lot of money

35:06.921 --> 35:08.420
and he died pretty wealthy.

35:08.422 --> 35:09.655
This guy was
a real piece of work.

35:09.657 --> 35:11.757
After he bought the land,
he put sheep on here

35:11.759 --> 35:13.259
and had them grazing.

35:13.261 --> 35:15.995
Back then, the Native American
tribe lived in the area, too,

35:15.997 --> 35:17.529
and they were called
the Luiseño.

35:17.531 --> 35:20.332
So now he would let the sheep
run rampant all over their land

35:20.334 --> 35:23.135
and eat their crops, so they
weren't too happy about it.

35:23.137 --> 35:24.336
They got into it with Murrieta.

35:24.338 --> 35:26.772
In 1875, Murrieta retaliated

35:26.774 --> 35:29.108
by getting 200
of the Native Americans

35:29.110 --> 35:30.476
kicked off the land.

35:30.478 --> 35:32.778
Meanwhile, Murrieta did
pretty good for himself.

35:32.780 --> 35:35.514
He lived a long life,
made a lot of money.

35:35.516 --> 35:39.118
I actually managed to track down
a few photos of this guy.

35:39.120 --> 35:42.755
This is him when
he's in his 30s, his 40s,

35:42.757 --> 35:45.357
and then this is him in his 80s,
right here in the middle.

35:47.228 --> 35:49.295
So is it possible
this is who you saw?

35:51.432 --> 35:55.434
It is him.

35:55.436 --> 35:58.370
Wow.

35:58.372 --> 36:01.307
Pretty crazy walk so far.
What else is going on?

36:01.309 --> 36:04.143
Then I ended up in

36:04.145 --> 36:06.946
the first door
to the left down the hallway.

36:06.948 --> 36:08.280
That's Emily's room.

36:08.282 --> 36:11.317
That, to me, was
the worst room in the house.

36:11.319 --> 36:15.254
I got straight-up that
she's a medium and very open.

36:15.256 --> 36:17.589
So with that being said,

36:17.591 --> 36:23.562
she is inadvertently attracting
a lot of dead people

36:23.564 --> 36:27.399
into her room
through the window.

36:27.401 --> 36:29.935
Lina, why don't you talk about
how Emily's changed?

36:29.937 --> 36:34.006
Emily has developed all
of a sudden terrible anxiety,

36:34.008 --> 36:36.608
depressive spells,
nervous breakdowns.

36:36.610 --> 36:37.843
She doesn't leave the house.

36:37.845 --> 36:39.678
It's a completely new person.

36:39.680 --> 36:42.481
Yeah, that breaks my heart
in a million pieces

36:42.483 --> 36:45.451
'cause I'd never seen her
like that before.

36:45.453 --> 36:47.486
It's, again, very similar to
what my dad's going through,

36:47.488 --> 36:51.156
but with Emily,
it's so scary.

36:51.158 --> 36:52.825
When you're growing up
as a medium,

36:52.827 --> 36:55.327
you do develop a lot of fear

36:55.329 --> 36:59.298
'cause you've experienced
a lot of death already.

36:59.300 --> 37:02.401
She probably
spontaneously opened

37:02.403 --> 37:05.104
when all this stuff
came in the house.

37:05.106 --> 37:07.506
- You mean the curse?
- Right.

37:09.410 --> 37:12.177
Are these dead people literally
coming through the window?

37:12.179 --> 37:16.015
Okay. So I had a sketch done
of what I saw happening.

37:20.688 --> 37:21.987
Wow.

37:25.493 --> 37:28.260
I- I honestly don't know
what to think.

37:35.302 --> 37:37.936
It breaks my heart, knowing that
I can't step in front of her

37:37.938 --> 37:41.473
and say, "I can take care
of this one."

37:41.475 --> 37:44.476
- And is that a shadow person?
- No, no, no.

37:44.478 --> 37:48.147
These things,
they're older than man.

37:48.149 --> 37:52.317
They've been here forever,
and they come for the stars.

37:52.319 --> 37:55.187
They're aliens, like,
<i>alien</i> aliens.

38:00.628 --> 38:03.328
I don't think the entire family
has been abducted.

38:03.330 --> 38:06.365
Okay. Who's been?

38:06.367 --> 38:09.968
I think that specifically,
probably the male line.

38:09.970 --> 38:11.203
My god.

38:13.974 --> 38:17.776
So Sal and Allan
have been abducted?

38:17.778 --> 38:22.147
I think that possibly
that they are abductees, yes.

38:24.218 --> 38:25.417
I- I don't know what to say.

38:25.419 --> 38:26.819
I don't know who to worry
about first.

38:26.821 --> 38:28.787
Do I worry about me? Do I worry
about my little sister?

38:28.789 --> 38:30.055
Everyone has their own
thing to deal with,

38:30.057 --> 38:31.356
and I'm just trying
to figure out,

38:31.358 --> 38:32.791
who should
I worry about first?

38:32.793 --> 38:35.227
We knew there was something.
We didn't know it was that much.

38:54.382 --> 38:55.981
So you guys look shell-shocked

38:55.983 --> 38:57.883
and I can't say that
I blame you,

38:57.885 --> 39:00.419
but it does explain
why Sal has changed so much.

39:00.421 --> 39:01.887
So now the big question is,
what can you do

39:01.889 --> 39:04.457
to have Emily go back
to her old self

39:04.459 --> 39:06.058
and make this
a happy home again?

39:06.060 --> 39:08.027
For that answer, I'm gonna
turn it over to Amy.

39:13.234 --> 39:16.001
So the first thing
that I would like you to do

39:16.003 --> 39:19.104
is take care of the curse.

39:19.106 --> 39:22.942
My suggestion is
to go and see a <i> curandero.</i>

39:22.944 --> 39:24.743
What exactly is a <i> curandero?</i>

39:24.745 --> 39:27.713
Native Americans, they would
have a witch doctor,

39:27.715 --> 39:31.250
and this is similar to that,
but for Latin American cultures.

39:31.252 --> 39:34.253
Once it's reversed,

39:34.255 --> 39:37.289
those little guys will
be gone.

39:37.291 --> 39:41.360
All of that extra weight that
you've been carrying around,

39:41.362 --> 39:43.195
the intense depression,

39:43.197 --> 39:46.098
all of these emotions
and things

39:46.100 --> 39:48.801
will just be gone.

39:48.803 --> 39:50.636
So when he goes to get
the curse removed,

39:50.638 --> 39:53.539
will that get rid
of the dead girl as well?

39:53.541 --> 39:58.310
I'm really hoping that
she'll go immediately.

39:58.312 --> 40:00.045
And the next thing
I would like to see

40:00.047 --> 40:02.548
is that you have
a male medium

40:02.550 --> 40:05.384
come and move on
the angry dead guy.

40:05.386 --> 40:07.520
Okay.

40:07.522 --> 40:09.555
As far as the alien issue,

40:09.557 --> 40:13.893
there's really not anything
that can be done about that.

40:13.895 --> 40:17.363
There are support groups.

40:17.365 --> 40:19.965
- What if they moved?
- No.

40:19.967 --> 40:22.768
No, no, no, no.
It would follow them.

40:25.439 --> 40:29.608
What I would like to see
with Emily

40:29.610 --> 40:32.978
is that I do think that
she needs to see, like,

40:32.980 --> 40:35.147
a psychotherapist.

40:35.149 --> 40:38.617
They're amazing
with treating PTSD,

40:38.619 --> 40:40.586
which I think she does have.

40:40.588 --> 40:43.455
So if Emily does
what you told them to do,

40:43.457 --> 40:46.292
she should be pretty much
back to her old self?

40:46.294 --> 40:48.794
Yeah.

40:48.796 --> 40:50.429
You got good news.

40:50.431 --> 40:53.832
Well, it's comforting
to know that, you know,

40:53.834 --> 40:56.869
at some point in time,
she could be back to herself

40:56.871 --> 40:59.204
and just have
a normal teenage life.

40:59.206 --> 41:01.440
That's all we'd want.

41:01.442 --> 41:03.776
So, Sal, are you gonna take
Amy's advice?

41:03.778 --> 41:05.210
Yes. Definitely.

41:05.212 --> 41:08.347
I appreciate her help.

41:08.349 --> 41:11.050
The things that we are
able to control,

41:11.052 --> 41:15.187
we're definitely gonna -- we're
gonna do what Amy is suggesting.

41:15.189 --> 41:19.692
I think your family, as a whole,
pretty strong and tight,

41:19.694 --> 41:22.461
so if anybody
can pull it off,

41:22.463 --> 41:23.862
it's probably you guys.

41:23.864 --> 41:25.097
Yeah, definitely.

41:25.099 --> 41:27.666
This is, you know,
what we needed,

41:27.668 --> 41:29.802
somewhere to get started.

41:29.804 --> 41:31.136
Even though there is little

41:31.138 --> 41:33.272
this family can do about
the aliens,

41:33.274 --> 41:34.773
they should be able
to break the curse

41:34.775 --> 41:36.408
with a <i> curandero</i>

41:36.410 --> 41:39.211
and move the angry dead guy on
with a medium.

41:39.213 --> 41:42.348
Once that's done, Emily can
get the help she needs,

41:42.350 --> 41:43.949
and this family
can find the peace

41:43.951 --> 41:45.818
they've been searching for.
