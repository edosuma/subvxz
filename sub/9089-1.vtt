- OK, Sid.
- Good luck to you.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.300
You look like shit.

04:16.000 --> 04:16.899
You look worse.

04:17.800 --> 04:18.500
Yeah?

04:24.400 --> 04:25.700
So I kinda missed you.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.100
Missed you too.

04:33.600 --> 04:36.500
- That just get weird?
- Yes, maybe a little.

04:38.800 --> 04:40.100
Here, take your bags?

04:40.800 --> 04:41.700
I can handle it.

04:41.800 --> 04:44.500
- You remember this.
- Ah, my favorite car.

05:04.600 --> 05:05.300
So...

05:06.600 --> 05:07.500
this is me.

05:09.200 --> 05:12.100
- You're kidding.
- Hey, this couch falls out.

05:12.200 --> 05:14.300
Or you could sleep in the window seat.

05:16.400 --> 05:18.900
This is the worst apartment
I've ever seen.

05:19.000 --> 05:23.700
Hey, it's not much, but it's mine.
There's cable TV, everything.

05:26.600 --> 05:29.700
- This is for me?
- No, it's for my other friend,

05:29.800 --> 05:32.500
- who just got out of prison.
- Heh.

05:35.600 --> 05:38.500
Whoa, "The Three Musketeers."

05:39.600 --> 05:40.900
Hey, look at Hirschey.

05:42.800 --> 05:44.100
Looks like a baby.

05:46.200 --> 05:48.900
- Those were the days, my friend.
- Yeah.

05:50.000 --> 05:50.900
Your place...

05:51.400 --> 05:52.100
looks...

05:52.800 --> 05:54.500
like where I just came from.

05:55.000 --> 05:58.900
- Except it's worse.
- It's not to your liking? Sorry.

05:59.000 --> 06:00.500
"Not to my liking"...

06:01.200 --> 06:03.300
is the understatement of all time.

06:03.600 --> 06:07.000
- There's cable TV.
- Yeah, I know, you said that already.

06:07.600 --> 06:11.900
I got Starz and Showtime,
and I was in fucking lockdown.

06:12.400 --> 06:13.500
I need to wash up.

06:15.200 --> 06:17.700
Can I use the commode
for like two seconds?

06:17.800 --> 06:19.100
- Sure.
- Thank you.

06:19.800 --> 06:21.900
I hope the commode is to your liking.

06:29.400 --> 06:30.500
Ah...

06:39.200 --> 06:40.300
Hey, brother.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.700
Could we skedaddle outta here, you think

06:46.000 --> 06:49.100
You know, is Mama Zeech's still open?

06:50.000 --> 06:50.700
Yeah.

06:52.400 --> 06:55.300
Good, I've been dreaming
about their coffee.

06:56.600 --> 06:58.900
Yeah, I could use a cup right now.

07:00.000 --> 07:02.100
We could do whatever you want, Val.

07:02.800 --> 07:03.700
It's your day.

07:04.200 --> 07:05.300
Yeah, let's do it.

07:11.400 --> 07:12.300
Yeah.

07:33.000 --> 07:34.300
Feel like partying?

07:34.400 --> 07:37.900
- Cause I could fucking party right now.
- No, I don't feel like partying.

07:40.400 --> 07:41.500
So, what then?

07:42.000 --> 07:45.900
I don't know what to tell you, Val.
I do the same thing everyday, I paint...

07:46.000 --> 07:51.500
the sunrise, watch the cable TV,
try to eat right, relax, go to bed.

07:52.600 --> 07:54.100
Nothing earth-shattering.

07:55.600 --> 07:58.300
How's, uh, your daughter. How's Jessica?

07:59.400 --> 08:01.100
She doesn't want me to find her.

08:01.800 --> 08:04.500
- And?
- I did anyway, she's working...

08:04.800 --> 08:05.900
Minneapolis.

08:06.600 --> 08:09.900
Oh, yeah? Didn't she have a kid?
Your granddaughter?

08:10.000 --> 08:11.100
She did... does.

08:11.800 --> 08:12.900
What's she up to?

08:14.600 --> 08:15.900
I couldn't find her.

08:19.600 --> 08:21.500
I kept in touch with some people.

08:22.600 --> 08:23.700
What people?

08:24.600 --> 08:26.100
Well, what people do you think?

08:27.000 --> 08:28.100
Friends.

08:28.800 --> 08:30.900
High, low places.

08:31.200 --> 08:32.900
Friends who would be...

08:33.200 --> 08:36.500
amenable to us having our comeback.

08:36.600 --> 08:39.500
- I'm retired.
- You're retired.

08:39.600 --> 08:41.100
I'm serious.

08:43.799 --> 08:45.100
Another subject.

08:46.600 --> 08:48.700
I could really fucking party.

08:49.400 --> 08:52.300
- You know what I'm saying?
- Should we go to Miss D's?

08:53.400 --> 08:54.500
Miss D's?

08:55.000 --> 08:56.100
Still exists?

08:58.000 --> 08:59.900
It's Doc, I called.

09:02.600 --> 09:03.700
- Yeah.
- This is Val.

09:03.800 --> 09:04.700
- Yeah, yeah.
- Hey.

09:04.800 --> 09:05.500
Come in.

09:06.000 --> 09:07.100
Looks the same.

09:10.600 --> 09:13.100
Miss de Havilland around anywhere?

09:13.400 --> 09:15.500
Yeah, I'm Miss de Havilland.

09:15.600 --> 09:17.300
He's talking about your mother, I think.

09:17.400 --> 09:21.900
Oh, she couldn't take the cold,
so she set up shop in Florida, Boca.

09:22.000 --> 09:23.700
- You look like her.
- Yeah?

09:23.800 --> 09:26.300
Anyway, my friend is looking for a party

09:27.000 --> 09:27.900
Yeah?

09:29.000 --> 09:30.900
What kind of party?

09:32.200 --> 09:34.100
- Bar Mitzvah.
- Ah...

09:34.200 --> 09:38.300
- Coming out party, going in party.
- Yeah, I got the next best thing.

09:38.800 --> 09:40.100
Oxana.

09:41.000 --> 09:43.300
Now, look at this.

09:46.200 --> 09:48.700
I think that's the party
I'm talking about, yeah.

09:50.600 --> 09:52.100
She's from Minsk.

09:52.200 --> 09:53.300
Very clean.

09:55.200 --> 09:56.900
Oh, yeah.

09:57.400 --> 09:58.500
Clean is good.

09:59.800 --> 10:02.100
- Happy parole.
- Follow me.

10:04.200 --> 10:05.300
Enjoy.

10:06.600 --> 10:07.500
All right.

10:07.800 --> 10:11.700
- Have a seat. Relax, relax.
- Thanks. Yeah.

10:14.600 --> 10:15.900
Fixed the place up.

10:16.400 --> 10:18.300
- It's the same, but different.
- Huh.

10:19.800 --> 10:20.500
Ah...

10:26.200 --> 10:28.500
Would you give my regards
to your mother, please?

10:29.200 --> 10:31.900
We used to be close, old friends.

10:34.800 --> 10:37.100
I hope she still remembers me.

10:38.000 --> 10:38.900
So do I.

10:47.000 --> 10:48.500
- Hello.
- She's a beauty.

10:48.600 --> 10:49.300
Hello.

10:49.800 --> 10:51.700
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
- Nice...

10:51.800 --> 10:53.700
too. Sweet girl.

10:54.000 --> 10:54.900
Aren't you?

10:55.200 --> 10:56.500
- She is.
- Come on.

10:57.000 --> 10:59.300
- Wanna have fun?
- I'm retired.

10:59.400 --> 11:01.300
- We'll have fun.
- Trust me, case closed.

11:01.400 --> 11:03.100
- Come on.
- Wendy...

11:03.400 --> 11:05.300
I need to use the phone, is that okay?

11:05.400 --> 11:07.500
Yeah, use... there's one...
there's one through there.

11:07.600 --> 11:08.300
Thank you.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.500
- Hey.
- That was quick.

11:11.600 --> 11:13.500
- Yeah, didn't work.
- Something wrong?

11:13.600 --> 11:15.700
- It's not good.
- No, not good.

11:15.800 --> 11:18.500
- Oh, it's okay, it's okay.
- We'll be back.

11:18.600 --> 11:19.500
What are you smiling at?

11:19.600 --> 11:22.100
- You find it funny? Is this funny?
- Nuh... nuh... no, no, I just...

11:22.200 --> 11:25.100
Do you have anything
that are good to help my friend out?

11:25.600 --> 11:26.700
Boner pills?

11:27.200 --> 11:29.700
Oh, we've... we ran out of boner pills.

11:29.800 --> 11:31.100
Is this a first for you?

11:31.200 --> 11:32.300
- It's okay.
- We'll come back.

11:32.400 --> 11:33.500
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

11:34.600 --> 11:36.500
- Just keep smiling.
- We'll be back.

11:36.600 --> 11:37.700
I'll settle up with you.

11:38.600 --> 11:42.500
Guys, if you get back before seven,
I'll give you the "Early Bird Special."

11:49.800 --> 11:52.700
- Now I thought you said you're retired.
- Uh-huh.

11:53.800 --> 11:55.500
But some tools...

11:56.200 --> 11:57.300
you hate to give up.

11:57.600 --> 12:00.100
Yeah. I could've done that with my dick.

12:00.600 --> 12:02.700
Come on in. That's why we're here.

12:02.800 --> 12:06.300
- Oh, that was just plain cruel.
- I'm sorry.

12:08.200 --> 12:12.300
Remember that time you threw that Greek
out of the hotel window?

12:13.200 --> 12:13.900
I do.

12:14.000 --> 12:16.700
Fell straight on to a street meat vendor

12:16.800 --> 12:18.600
I felt bad about that part.

12:25.200 --> 12:27.900
Oh, this is definitely
a violation of my parole.

12:28.000 --> 12:32.100
It's OK, I need to fill
my Nexium prescription anyway.

12:32.600 --> 12:35.100
- What's Nexium?
- It's for my ulcer.

12:35.200 --> 12:36.900
So, what are we looking for?

12:37.400 --> 12:38.900
Ah, this.

12:39.400 --> 12:40.300
What is that?

12:41.000 --> 12:42.500
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh...

12:46.200 --> 12:48.100
You're only supposed to take one.

12:49.600 --> 12:51.100
I wanna make sure.

12:55.800 --> 12:57.900
So, we... we... done here?

12:58.200 --> 13:00.500
No, I need some Perindopril.

13:01.600 --> 13:02.300
What?

13:03.000 --> 13:04.100
And some...

13:05.200 --> 13:10.300
Ooh, Latanoprost.
My co-pay is insane on this one.

13:11.200 --> 13:15.300
And, uh, ooh, Aldactone for hypertension

13:16.000 --> 13:16.700
Mm-hmm.

13:17.800 --> 13:19.300
How much shit are you on?

13:19.800 --> 13:20.700
A lot.

13:24.800 --> 13:29.100
So how long does this take
to get the pipes working?

13:29.200 --> 13:30.300
I wouldn't know.

13:32.400 --> 13:34.100
So what are we gonna do while we wait?

13:36.800 --> 13:40.500
Three Andrew Jacksons say I, uh,
run this table.

13:40.600 --> 13:42.500
But, uh, you don't have any money.

13:42.800 --> 13:43.700
What does that mean?

13:44.400 --> 13:45.500
You spot me.

13:46.000 --> 13:48.900
But, uh, that would be
robbing Peter to pay Paul.

13:49.000 --> 13:52.500
"Each one must give
as he has decided in his heart,"

13:52.600 --> 13:57.900
- "not reluctantly or under compulsion."
- Uh-huh, Corinthians.

13:58.200 --> 14:01.500
- Chapter nine, verse seven.
- I love Corinthians.

14:01.600 --> 14:04.500
OK, um, let's do the five.

14:05.000 --> 14:08.700
- Oh, it's on now.
- Oh, wait, let me get out of your way.

14:08.800 --> 14:10.500
Go ahead, stay in my way then.

14:12.600 --> 14:13.900
- Oh!
- See?

14:14.800 --> 14:15.500
Keep it.

14:16.600 --> 14:18.300
- Thank you.
- It's yours.

14:18.400 --> 14:20.300
Oh, you gave me a nice thing here.

14:20.800 --> 14:22.900
- Too easy, but I'm gonna take it.
- Oh, it is easy.

14:23.000 --> 14:24.700
- Hello!
- Oh!

14:26.200 --> 14:28.500
- That was not fair.
- No, it wasn't.

14:30.200 --> 14:31.500
Uh-oh.

14:32.600 --> 14:33.300
What?

14:36.400 --> 14:40.900
Mount Everest just moved into my pants.

14:43.600 --> 14:44.300
So...

14:45.200 --> 14:46.300
all systems go?

14:47.000 --> 14:48.100
Oh, yeah.

14:48.600 --> 14:50.300
I'm so fucking hard...

14:50.800 --> 14:52.900
I could cut a diamond.

14:53.000 --> 14:56.300
- You shouldn't have taken so many.
- Oh, fuck that.

14:59.800 --> 15:01.300
My old friend.

15:03.600 --> 15:07.100
- Are you ready, Val?
- Ooh, ah, whoa...

15:07.800 --> 15:11.700
You don't know. I never been more ready.

15:12.200 --> 15:14.900
- Let us go.
- Oh, yes.

15:16.800 --> 15:17.500
Come on.

15:18.600 --> 15:22.300
Next smile you see,
will be on Oxana's face.

15:23.600 --> 15:24.900
He's my only son.

15:25.600 --> 15:27.500
- Aw...
- I'm coming in to use the phone, OK?

15:38.400 --> 15:40.900
Paul, where's my
fucking Kung Pao Chicken?

15:41.400 --> 15:45.700
- It's on it's way. You got a call.
- Fuck my ass. Gimme the phone.

15:51.600 --> 15:53.100
Claphands here.

15:54.400 --> 15:55.300
It's Doc.

15:57.600 --> 16:00.100
Would the package be delivered on time?

16:00.800 --> 16:03.500
I can't do what I said I would do.

16:03.800 --> 16:04.900
<i>Well then, if you</i>

16:05.000 --> 16:07.700
can't deliver the package,

16:08.600 --> 16:12.300
then you won't be
a friend of mine any longer.

16:13.200 --> 16:16.500
Do I need to become more explicit here?

16:18.200 --> 16:18.900
No.

16:19.000 --> 16:19.900
<i>No.</i>

16:21.800 --> 16:23.500
I didn't think so.

16:24.600 --> 16:26.300
How long do I have?

16:26.400 --> 16:28.100
<i>What do you mean "how long do you have"?</i>

16:28.200 --> 16:30.100
To deliver the package.

16:30.200 --> 16:31.500
<i>How long do I have?</i>

16:31.600 --> 16:33.100
I don't fucking believe this shit.

16:33.200 --> 16:36.700
Do I have dementia? Paul, who's
the President of the United States?

16:36.800 --> 16:38.500
- Um...
- Shut the fuck up!

16:38.600 --> 16:41.900
You have until morning.

16:42.600 --> 16:46.100
What, like ten,
or later, like brunch time?

16:48.600 --> 16:51.300
This is like talking to Conchita my maid

16:52.000 --> 16:56.500
Kill him by 10 o'clock in the AM,
or you're dead too.

16:57.000 --> 16:59.700
Motherfucker shoots my only son!

17:01.000 --> 17:06.700
The only reason I've let you live
was for this. We clear?

17:08.599 --> 17:11.500
- We're clear.
- Then good night.

17:26.599 --> 17:28.300
Wendy, Wendy.

17:29.800 --> 17:30.500
Doc.

17:31.400 --> 17:35.300
- Everything all right?
- No, but thank you for asking.

17:37.300 --> 17:41.300
Bet you're the type of man who wouldn't
let a lady drink by herself, huh?

17:42.800 --> 17:43.700
Of course not.

17:47.600 --> 17:49.500
Just a pfft taste.

17:50.800 --> 17:52.300
This is good stuff.

17:57.000 --> 17:58.100
Ah...

18:01.800 --> 18:06.900
Doc, my mother always told me to do the
best with what you have, where you are.

18:08.600 --> 18:09.900
Your mother was something.

18:11.000 --> 18:13.300
Oh... Ah...

18:14.000 --> 18:17.900
So, did everything work this time,
Valentine?

18:18.000 --> 18:23.700
Four times. It worked. I coulda
gone again, but she's all worn out.

18:24.200 --> 18:27.500
- Good for you.
- Come on, let's blow this pop stand.

18:27.800 --> 18:30.500
Wendy, for everything, thank you.

18:31.000 --> 18:32.700
Hope we find peace, Doc.

18:34.600 --> 18:38.100
- Me too.
- I feel so ready to party.

18:39.600 --> 18:40.700
Bye, Smiley.

18:49.200 --> 18:51.500
Those girls look like they wanna party.

18:52.800 --> 18:55.500
- Why embarrass yourself?
- Ah...

18:56.400 --> 18:57.900
Embarrass myself?

18:58.200 --> 19:01.700
We're doing a battle of the balls. This
goes up and down like a fucking yo-yo.

19:01.800 --> 19:02.700
Pray for me.

19:10.200 --> 19:11.500
Hey, ladies.

19:12.200 --> 19:14.100
Whaddya say, whaddya know?

19:15.600 --> 19:17.300
It's me, Jack-a-Mo.

19:21.400 --> 19:22.700
Shouldn't you be in bed?

19:23.200 --> 19:24.300
In bed?

19:25.400 --> 19:26.300
Baby...

19:27.800 --> 19:30.300
I got a python in my pants...

19:30.800 --> 19:33.300
harder than the Rock of Gibral...

19:39.600 --> 19:40.500
Don't talk to me.

19:40.600 --> 19:43.500
- Can we go home now?
- Oh, no. Definitely not now.

19:44.400 --> 19:45.500
We don't go home.

19:46.400 --> 19:47.900
We're just gettin' started, buddy.

19:48.000 --> 19:50.300
I need uh, 20 bucks. I'll be right back.

19:50.400 --> 19:53.100
- What are you doing, Val?
- Just give it to me, I'm not asking.

19:55.400 --> 19:56.100
Yeah.

19:56.600 --> 19:59.700
Hey, hey, can you help a brother out?

20:00.000 --> 20:00.900
What's happening?

20:01.200 --> 20:03.500
I want you to play
something a lil' different.

20:03.800 --> 20:07.900
You know, like when music was still
music, when it had a lil' soul.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.900
- Ah, ya talking old school.
- Old school, yeah.

20:11.200 --> 20:13.700
Right, yeah, there's not much call
for old school around here.

20:13.800 --> 20:16.500
Well, tonight may be different, OK?

20:18.200 --> 20:20.900
- I think it could be.
- I can trust you, right? Slow.

20:21.000 --> 20:22.900
- You can trust me.
- Don't let me down.

20:25.800 --> 20:27.700
Hey, I'm back.

20:29.000 --> 20:32.700
First of all, I just want to say,
it was rude, what I did.

20:32.800 --> 20:35.900
- Yes.
- And I deserve everything you gave me.

20:37.400 --> 20:40.100
I apologize. You forgive me?

20:43.400 --> 20:45.300
Anyway, do you like to dance?

20:47.800 --> 20:49.100
- Mm-hmm.
- Lisa.

20:49.200 --> 20:53.100
Listen, Lisa, um, I'm Valentine.

20:54.000 --> 20:57.100
My friends call me Val,
and here's the situation.

20:57.200 --> 20:59.100
I've been away for a long time.

20:59.600 --> 21:04.100
I mean, where, I can't say, but
I really need you to dance with me.

21:05.400 --> 21:09.100
Now, I'm not gonna ask you to go home
with me, I'm not gonna try to kiss you,

21:09.200 --> 21:11.100
or you know, feel your ass, or anything.

21:11.600 --> 21:15.100
I just wanna dance. One song.

21:16.400 --> 21:18.900
That's all I'm proposing. Two people...

21:19.600 --> 21:24.500
holdin' each other,
smiling at time, nothing else.

21:25.400 --> 21:30.500
After that, you'll never see me,
or hear from me...

21:31.600 --> 21:36.500
again. I promise.
How's that sound to you, Lisa?

21:37.200 --> 21:38.300
Whaddya think?

21:40.200 --> 21:42.300
- All right, Val.
- All right, that's good.

21:44.800 --> 21:46.100

I could feel...

26:17.200 --> 26:18.500

- Excuse me.
- Yup.

31:05.400 --> 31:07.700
- Take a quick look.
- Mm-hmm.

31:12.600 --> 31:15.500
- How many pills did he take?
- A fistful.

31:15.800 --> 31:18.500
- I see.
- Are you a real doctor?

31:18.600 --> 31:21.700
Are you a real patient?
Is that a real penis?

31:22.200 --> 31:25.100
Mr. Valentine, you have
what is called vein-induced priapism.

31:25.200 --> 31:28.200
Now, I can give you some blood thinners
to open things up a bit, but, uh...

31:28.300 --> 31:31.300
old blood's gotta be removed,
in order for fresh blood to flow in.

31:31.400 --> 31:34.300
- Removed in what way, removed?
- What's he talk...

31:35.000 --> 31:38.700
- Oh!
- Oh, fuck me.

31:38.800 --> 31:40.700
OK, let's relax.

31:41.400 --> 31:43.500
What is this? Where are you going, Doc?
Where are you going?

31:43.600 --> 31:44.900
I'm outta here.

31:45.000 --> 31:47.300
- Oh, no, what are you doing?
- I'll be... I'll be in the waiting room

31:47.400 --> 31:48.700
Look at me, breathe.

31:49.800 --> 31:53.300
- Maybe I partied a lil' too hard.
- Maybe a little.

31:54.600 --> 31:56.700
I don't have, uh...

31:56.800 --> 31:58.100
health insurance.

31:58.400 --> 32:01.100
- I paid the bill.
- OK.

32:04.200 --> 32:05.500
So who's gonna do it?

32:06.200 --> 32:08.100
- Do what?
- You know what.

32:08.800 --> 32:09.700
I don't.

32:10.200 --> 32:14.700
Let's just drop
the "welcome home" thing, OK? I know.

32:16.000 --> 32:18.900
- Hey there, Doc.
- Hey, Alex.

32:19.000 --> 32:22.300
- Who's your friend?
- This is my best friend...

32:22.800 --> 32:26.900
Valentine. Alex,
he just got back from a long trip.

32:27.000 --> 32:28.500
Well, how was your trip, Valentine?

32:28.600 --> 32:33.300
Oh it was... um, I'm just glad I'm back,
and I don't answer to the name Valentine

32:34.000 --> 32:38.700
- My friends call me Val.
- OK, well, then I'll call you Val, Val.

32:39.200 --> 32:43.300
- Well, then we're friends.
- Yeah, you can never have enough.

32:43.600 --> 32:46.700
- Yeah, you're right, there.
- Doc and I, well, we've been friends

32:46.800 --> 32:48.700
- for a while now, haven't we?
- We have.

32:48.800 --> 32:50.700
I remember the very first time
he walked in here.

32:50.800 --> 32:53.100
- You remember that?
- Sure I do.

32:53.200 --> 32:56.900
I hate to break up this "remembering
the more wistful times", but...

32:57.400 --> 33:01.700
- I'm-I'm a little on the peckish side.
- Sure, what'll it be tonight, fellas?

33:01.800 --> 33:04.100
- Uh, a tea and lemon, please.
- OK.

33:04.200 --> 33:06.300
Uh, I'll have the Surf n' Turf...

33:07.200 --> 33:08.900
and a Root Beer Float.

33:10.000 --> 33:11.700
All right,
how do you like your steak done, Val?

33:12.400 --> 33:13.300
Bloody.

33:15.000 --> 33:16.700
- Coming right up.
- Yeah.

33:19.000 --> 33:21.700
- Enjoy your dinner, Ernie.
- Can I have a little more?

33:22.200 --> 33:23.700
Is she always so sweet?

33:24.000 --> 33:28.300
Every day I walk outta here,
I'm always better.

33:28.400 --> 33:29.500
Yeah.

33:31.200 --> 33:32.500
So who's gonna do it?

33:34.000 --> 33:34.700
I don't know.

33:35.600 --> 33:37.300
- It's you, isn't it.
- I don't know.

33:37.400 --> 33:40.500
It's you. Come on, just say it. It's you

33:41.000 --> 33:44.300
Whaddya think this is here, I'm gonna
blame you for anything? A job is a job.

33:44.400 --> 33:47.700
If the roles were reversed,
I'd do it in a heartbeat.

33:47.800 --> 33:50.500
Come on, man, say it's you!

33:50.600 --> 33:51.300
It's me.

33:59.400 --> 34:00.500
Claphands.

34:02.000 --> 34:04.300
He's got a mean streak in him, no?

34:04.800 --> 34:08.100
- Bit of an understatement.
- Yeah.

34:09.199 --> 34:12.300
Meanest, most vindictive motherfucker...

34:14.000 --> 34:15.900
outside the Devil himself.

34:20.600 --> 34:23.500
First couple of years I was inside...

34:25.000 --> 34:28.300
I had my head on a swivel, you know,
I was looking here, looking there.

34:28.400 --> 34:31.300
What the fuck is gonna happen,
and when is it gonna happen?

34:32.000 --> 34:33.900
Is it gonna happen in the laundry room,

34:34.000 --> 34:37.500
on the yard, or am I gonna get it
in the fucking cafetaria?

34:37.600 --> 34:40.500
That's-that's all I thought about,
and then I understood somethin'.

34:41.600 --> 34:42.900
He's gonna make me...

34:43.800 --> 34:47.900
serve every single day of my sentence.

34:48.800 --> 34:52.100
So, it would end up just like this.

34:58.800 --> 35:00.300
So, how were you gonna do it?

35:02.400 --> 35:05.100
In my apartment, while you're asleep.

35:05.800 --> 35:06.700
You see?

35:08.000 --> 35:11.900
Thats got no flavor, thats got no style.

35:12.000 --> 35:14.500
Come on, what is that?

35:15.600 --> 35:16.900
While I'm asleep.

35:18.400 --> 35:20.100
How do you think I should do it?

35:21.600 --> 35:22.500
I don't.

35:24.000 --> 35:25.100
There's the rub.

35:29.800 --> 35:31.500
He put his son on the job.

35:33.800 --> 35:35.300
This was a bad idea.

35:36.600 --> 35:39.700
OK, fine, I'm not gonna ask questions.

35:40.400 --> 35:41.700
First sign of trouble...

35:42.400 --> 35:44.900
the kid panics,
starts shooting everywhere...

35:45.800 --> 35:46.900
catches my bullet...

35:47.600 --> 35:48.900
in the crossfire.

35:50.000 --> 35:53.300
- Could've been anybody's.
- I was there, I know.

35:55.400 --> 35:56.900
This was an accident.

35:58.200 --> 35:59.500
How's it my fault?

36:02.200 --> 36:07.500
I'm a fucking stand-up guy,
I took the fall for everyone.

36:07.800 --> 36:09.500
You did, I know that.

36:09.600 --> 36:14.900
And they pressed me.
I didn't say a word, not a fucking word.

36:18.400 --> 36:19.100
And...

36:20.800 --> 36:22.300
this is what it comes to.

36:29.800 --> 36:32.100
When did Claphands give you this job?

36:36.400 --> 36:37.500
The day...

36:39.000 --> 36:40.100
you went in.

36:41.600 --> 36:45.900
- For 28 years, he was sittin' on you.
- Yes.

36:46.600 --> 36:49.700
Now, that is fucked.

36:51.000 --> 36:52.900
Here's your tea, Doc.

36:53.400 --> 36:55.100
Root Beer Float for you.

36:55.800 --> 36:57.700
And that's the Surf n' Turf.

36:59.600 --> 37:02.900
Alex, can I say that...

37:03.200 --> 37:07.100
this is the best Surf n' Turf
I've seen in all my travels.

37:07.200 --> 37:07.900
Yeah?

37:08.800 --> 37:12.900
- Can I say that?
- That's very kind of you to say, Val.

37:14.600 --> 37:16.300
- Are you OK, Doc?
- Yeah.

37:22.000 --> 37:23.500
So when are you gonna do it?

37:25.200 --> 37:27.900
By ten this morning, it has to be done.

37:28.600 --> 37:29.500
OK.

37:30.600 --> 37:33.900
Oh, nope, this doesn't work.
What time is it now?

37:34.800 --> 37:37.300
1:17 in the AM.

37:38.000 --> 37:40.500
That's-that's about nine hours.

37:43.000 --> 37:43.700
Yeah.

37:54.600 --> 37:55.900
Let's get in the car.

37:56.200 --> 37:59.100
Hey, man, let's... Why don't we
skedaddle down the road a bit.

38:00.200 --> 38:03.300
I wanna walk off this, uh...

38:03.400 --> 38:06.300
Surf n' Turf with a Root
Beer Float, you know...

38:07.200 --> 38:08.300
my digestion.

38:09.200 --> 38:09.900
Sure.

38:12.200 --> 38:14.900
So, what are my options now?

38:15.400 --> 38:16.500
You could run.

38:18.200 --> 38:19.700
They'd find me.

38:23.200 --> 38:24.700
You might buy some time.

38:26.600 --> 38:28.700
- But if I run...
- What?

38:30.600 --> 38:32.900
You're not gonna have
any friends any more.

38:33.800 --> 38:35.300
True, but...

38:37.600 --> 38:39.900
You'd have a head start at least.

38:42.000 --> 38:44.100
Ah... better this way.

38:44.600 --> 38:47.300
- How's it better?
- It's better because...

38:48.400 --> 38:51.900
- then I can say goodbye.
- I don't want you to say goodbye.

38:52.000 --> 38:53.500
Well, what do you want me to say then?

38:53.600 --> 38:58.300
I have to say goodbye.
There's nothing left for me to say.

39:01.200 --> 39:02.100
Hold up.

39:03.000 --> 39:05.700
- Something has presented itself.
- What?

39:06.800 --> 39:07.500
What?

39:09.000 --> 39:12.100
What kind of a big, beautiful...

39:12.800 --> 39:16.900
- beast of a car is this?
- Val, no.

39:17.200 --> 39:21.100
I think she's lonely.
I think she wants us to take her out.

39:21.400 --> 39:22.500
On a date.

39:23.000 --> 39:26.900
This car belongs to the Jargoniew
brothers. I happen to know them.

39:27.600 --> 39:30.100
A-a-and that's supposed to
mean somethin' to me?

39:30.200 --> 39:31.700
Nobody messes with these guys.

39:31.800 --> 39:36.100
These are the type of guys,
take yer kidneys out, not even sell them

39:36.400 --> 39:39.100
If we only had a coat hanger, right?

39:39.600 --> 39:40.700
You can't open a car

39:40.800 --> 39:42.900
- with a coat hanger any more, Val.
- Says who?

39:43.200 --> 39:45.300
Says the people who make cars.

39:51.400 --> 39:56.100
What kinda asshole
keeps a car like this open?

39:56.200 --> 39:59.300
These guys don't worry about
somebody stealing their car, Val.

39:59.400 --> 40:00.700
They better start.

40:01.400 --> 40:04.300
- Come on.
- These guys, I'm telling you...

40:05.400 --> 40:07.300
These morons even left the key.

40:08.800 --> 40:10.700
What the...
where does this fucking key go?

40:10.800 --> 40:12.500
This is not a good idea, Val.

40:12.600 --> 40:15.300
Yeah, well, my life
is full of "not good ideas."

40:15.400 --> 40:17.100
How do you start it, you know how?

40:18.000 --> 40:22.900
- They make cars differently these days.
- Yeah, so you know how to do it?

40:23.800 --> 40:25.300
- Put your foot on the brake.
- Yeah.

40:25.400 --> 40:27.300
- And press that button.
- This button?

40:27.600 --> 40:28.300
See?

40:28.400 --> 40:31.300
- Holy shit, fuck.
- Whoa...

40:32.600 --> 40:33.500
Where to?

40:33.800 --> 40:36.100
Where to? Whaddya think?

40:37.600 --> 40:40.900
- Our friend needs rescuing.
- Yes.

40:59.000 --> 41:01.300
Whoa... I don't ever wanna end up
in one of these places.

41:01.400 --> 41:02.300
Me too.

41:04.200 --> 41:06.700
- Hey, excuse me.
- Yeah?

41:06.800 --> 41:10.700
Would you happen to know
where Richard Hirsch's room is?

41:10.800 --> 41:14.700
- I like Hirsch. Are you his friends?
- Yeah, the best.

41:15.200 --> 41:16.700
His room is...

41:17.000 --> 41:20.700
down at the end of the hall,
and to your left.

41:21.200 --> 41:22.500
Thanks a bunch.

41:22.800 --> 41:26.700
- Hey, are you here to rescue him?
- How'd you know?

41:27.600 --> 41:30.300
I wish somebody would come and rescue me

41:31.000 --> 41:32.500
We all do, honey.

41:48.400 --> 41:52.500
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

41:55.200 --> 41:57.700
- I feel like I'm dreaming.
- Hirsch.

41:57.800 --> 42:03.300
You're still here. We're all still here.
You fucking guys, its like the old days.

42:03.400 --> 42:04.100
So?

42:05.800 --> 42:07.500
Get me the fuck outta here.

42:08.400 --> 42:10.100
- Get me outta here.
- Here.

42:10.800 --> 42:11.700
- Yeah.
- Ah...

42:12.400 --> 42:13.900
Wait a second, let me get a hit.

42:21.200 --> 42:22.300
Let's escape.

42:23.000 --> 42:23.900
You want us to bring that?

42:24.000 --> 42:26.700
- Nada, let's roll.
- You better get dressed.

42:30.400 --> 42:33.300
Oh, man, the sweet taste of freedom.

42:35.000 --> 42:36.100
We got a ride?

42:36.800 --> 42:37.500
This is it.

42:37.800 --> 42:39.300
- Huh?
- Right here.

42:40.400 --> 42:41.500
Oh, man.

42:42.000 --> 42:43.500
You get to drive it.

42:43.600 --> 42:45.700
- Oh-ho.
- OK.

42:45.800 --> 42:46.900
Oop... Ah...

42:47.000 --> 42:48.700
- There's no leg room here.
- Yeah.

42:48.800 --> 42:50.900
Tight back here, I just banged my head.

42:51.000 --> 42:54.300
The hell with your leg room.
I'm 6' 2", let's go.

42:55.200 --> 42:57.700
- Ey.
- The situation is not ideal.

42:58.600 --> 43:01.500
- You're a master.
- Yeah, I was.

43:01.600 --> 43:03.300
- You are.
- I was.

43:03.400 --> 43:06.100
- You don't forget that stuff.
- You're a master, Hirsch.

43:06.200 --> 43:09.900
Four minutes ago,
you were sittin' in a dying house.

43:10.000 --> 43:15.100
Now you're sittin' in this beast
of a car, you know. The situation's OK.

43:15.200 --> 43:17.100
Is that right? Gimme the key.

43:18.000 --> 43:19.300
There's no key.

43:19.600 --> 43:22.300
- Don't fuck around, gimme the key.
- It's new. It's a button.

43:22.400 --> 43:23.500
- And it's automatic.
- You push the button.

43:23.600 --> 43:24.700
- A button?
- It's computers.

43:24.800 --> 43:26.100
- Is it here?
- Yeah.

43:27.000 --> 43:29.500
You put-put your foot on the brake
at the same time.

43:30.400 --> 43:31.500
- All right.
- OK?

43:31.600 --> 43:32.900
- Yeah.
- Can we go now?

43:33.000 --> 43:35.900
Well, it's a million dials here.
I never saw this before.

43:36.600 --> 43:38.500
Man, this is like the future.

43:41.800 --> 43:42.900
Oh-ho!

43:44.800 --> 43:46.500
Very nice.

43:49.600 --> 43:50.900
So, Hirsch...

43:52.600 --> 43:55.700
Whaddya been doing
since the last time I saw you.

43:56.400 --> 43:58.100
Grieving, mostly.

43:58.400 --> 44:02.300
- Ah, me too.
- A different kind, I guess.

44:06.900 --> 44:11.900
Hey, I'm sorry for your loss.
Sorry about Julie.

44:12.000 --> 44:14.300
Well you know, she was in a lot of pain.

44:14.400 --> 44:17.700
- Yup.
- Uh... Whaddya say.

44:17.800 --> 44:18.900
So how's your health?

44:19.800 --> 44:21.900
Well, they took something out of me
a couple of months ago.

44:22.000 --> 44:22.900
What'd they take out?

44:23.000 --> 44:25.300
I don't know. I didn't ask.
It's none of business.

44:25.600 --> 44:28.900
But I'm a little more streamlined now,
a little more aerodynamic.

44:29.000 --> 44:31.500
- Which way is the highway?
- Not the highway, Hirsch.

44:31.600 --> 44:33.700
Which way is the highway?
I'm not gonna ask again.

44:33.800 --> 44:35.900
- Go left.
- Go left, young man.

44:36.000 --> 44:38.700
- Go left!
- Yo!

44:45.600 --> 44:48.700
- So I got into gardening.
- Where? In the joint?

44:48.800 --> 44:50.900
- Yeah.
- Yeah, Julie was into that.

44:51.000 --> 44:52.300
- No, yeah?
- Yeah.

44:52.400 --> 44:54.700
I got quite a little green thumb, fellas

44:54.800 --> 44:56.900
- I'm not surprised.
- Whoa!

45:01.400 --> 45:04.500
I knew a guy got out, committed a crime,

45:04.600 --> 45:08.100
in order to get back in, so he could see
how his garden was going.

45:08.200 --> 45:10.500
Sounds like you loved it too.

45:10.600 --> 45:14.500
Loved it? I love it. I mean, I still do.

45:17.600 --> 45:18.500
Uh-oh.

45:19.400 --> 45:20.900
"Uh-oh" what?

45:26.800 --> 45:30.300
- Don't worry, I can lose 'em.
- I got paroled today.

45:30.600 --> 45:34.900
We're driving in a stolen car,
and I imagine you're carrying a weapon.

45:35.000 --> 45:35.900
I am.

45:36.600 --> 45:38.700
- So?
- So...

45:39.000 --> 45:41.300
I'm already fucked five ways to Sunday.

45:41.400 --> 45:42.500
Let's rumble!

45:57.600 --> 45:58.900
We got two of them.

45:59.400 --> 46:01.300
I can see, I can see.

46:06.600 --> 46:11.700
Hirsch, remember the time
in that shitbox car, with the Chinaman?

46:12.000 --> 46:12.900
Yeah, I do.

46:13.800 --> 46:15.700
I think you should do that again.

46:16.000 --> 46:17.900
- You do, huh?
- I do.

46:41.000 --> 46:44.100
Hey, Hirsch, nice driving, by the way.

46:44.200 --> 46:46.300
- Thanks.
- I mean, you still got it, buddy.

46:46.400 --> 46:48.900
- Yeah, I do, don't I?
- Yeah, absolutely.

46:49.000 --> 46:53.700
- That was intense. I got a rush.
- Hey, I threw up in my mouth.

46:54.400 --> 46:55.900
So when'd you get out, Val?

46:56.600 --> 46:57.500
Today.

46:57.600 --> 46:58.700
- Today?
- Yeah.

46:58.800 --> 47:01.300
- Get the hell outta here.
- No, yeah, ask Doc.

47:01.400 --> 47:02.500
- No kidding.
- Yeah.

47:02.600 --> 47:05.900
- We got sprung on the same day.
- It's nice you can share that.

47:06.200 --> 47:09.100
- 28 years.
- 28 fucking years.

47:09.200 --> 47:13.300
You did your time like a man, Val.
You're a stand-up all the way.

47:13.600 --> 47:16.300
Well, you know,
you and Doc would have done the same.

47:16.400 --> 47:17.900
Well, I would like to think so.

47:18.000 --> 47:21.900
It's possible, either way is possible,
but you did it, Val.

47:22.000 --> 47:24.900
True. I can't believe...

47:25.000 --> 47:26.900
you guys didn't work together...

47:27.000 --> 47:27.900
- all this time.
- Nope.

47:28.000 --> 47:30.500
No, no, no,
Claphands retired us, that was that.

47:30.600 --> 47:31.700
And it was.

47:31.800 --> 47:36.100
He can't forgive himself,
so everybody else has gotta pay.

47:36.600 --> 47:38.700
So whaddya wanna do now you're out, Val?

47:39.200 --> 47:41.300
I always wanted to finish high school.

47:42.000 --> 47:44.700
Learn more about the human condition.

47:45.200 --> 47:46.500
How about you, Hirsch?

47:47.200 --> 47:50.700
Is there anything in this life,
that you haven't done...

47:51.000 --> 47:53.700
that
you would like to have a chance to do?

47:54.000 --> 47:55.900
Two girls at the same time.

47:56.400 --> 48:00.500
- That's very doable, no, Doc?
- Yeah, done and done.

48:05.000 --> 48:06.700
Back so soon?

48:08.200 --> 48:10.700
One more time,
you get the free coffee mug.

48:10.800 --> 48:14.500
Wendy, we'd like you to meet
our associate, Richard Hirsch.

48:14.600 --> 48:15.500
How're you doin'?

48:16.000 --> 48:16.700
Hullo.

48:16.800 --> 48:21.900
He's looking for, what is known
in French, as the "ménage à trois."

48:22.000 --> 48:23.700
Shi--t.

48:24.400 --> 48:27.300
Oxana's the only one working, uh...

48:28.200 --> 48:30.300
Irena fell down the stairs.

48:30.600 --> 48:31.900
Oh, what about you?

48:34.000 --> 48:35.100
Who, me?

48:36.200 --> 48:40.100
No... I don't do it for money. I just...

48:40.200 --> 48:41.500
Well, we won't pay ya.

48:41.800 --> 48:42.900
Oh...

48:43.400 --> 48:45.300
Excuse me, uh, what's your name?

48:45.800 --> 48:46.900
Wendy.

48:53.800 --> 48:56.100
...you're gonna have
the greatest experience of your life...

49:00.600 --> 49:02.700
up to you whether you wanna experience..

49:07.200 --> 49:08.900
...to me and that big a deal.

49:11.000 --> 49:13.500
- Do you promise?
- I swear to God.

49:16.400 --> 49:17.300
OK.

49:17.800 --> 49:19.300
But it costs triple!

49:19.800 --> 49:21.900
- Shouldn't it be double?
- Yeah, it should.

49:22.200 --> 49:24.100
Doc, if you please.

49:25.600 --> 49:26.500
I guess.

49:27.400 --> 49:28.300
Oxana.

49:31.800 --> 49:33.300
Go easy on him, girls.

49:37.400 --> 49:40.700
If I hadn't seen it, I wouldn't...
I wouldn't believe it.

49:40.800 --> 49:43.100
He would pump it up on a vacuum cleaner.

49:44.200 --> 49:44.900
Yeah?

49:45.200 --> 49:47.100
He said, every day he would just...

49:47.200 --> 49:49.500
whatever he did,
he watched TV, he listened to the radio.

49:49.600 --> 49:52.700
Now, he would atta... you know,
the attachment on a vacuum cleaner.

49:52.800 --> 49:53.900
Now,
what do you call the thing that they...

49:54.000 --> 49:55.900
- It's a nozzle.
- The nozzle.

49:56.000 --> 49:59.100
Yeah, but it's like, for taking
the stuff off the corners of the couch.

49:59.200 --> 50:01.100
- I mean why do you put your dick in it.
- It doesn't matter because

50:01.200 --> 50:06.300
it stretched his dick, and his dick
kept getting bigger and bigger.

50:06.400 --> 50:11.100
There's other ways. There's a
Chinese thing I heard about. It's a jar.

50:11.200 --> 50:16.500
They put bees in it. You put it
on your schlong. The bees bite yer dick.

50:18.000 --> 50:21.900
- Hello.
- It-it gets all swollen, huge.

50:22.000 --> 50:23.900
Yeah, but, uh, where do you put it?

50:24.600 --> 50:27.100
I don't know. It's good for show anyway.

50:27.200 --> 50:29.100
Well, that makes so much sense.

50:29.600 --> 50:32.100
Hirsch has been up there a long time.

50:32.600 --> 50:33.900
Well, good for him.

50:37.000 --> 50:38.500
Whoa, here he comes!

50:40.400 --> 50:41.300
So...

50:41.600 --> 50:44.500
- pipes still workin'?
- You could put it that way.

50:47.600 --> 50:49.500
OK. Jesus, that's enough.

50:49.600 --> 50:52.500
I do not know the
English word for what I feel.

50:52.600 --> 50:55.900
- "Surprised"?
- I think it's called "lust," darling.

50:56.000 --> 50:58.300
- "Love." That is close enough.
- Good, OK.

50:58.400 --> 51:00.500
- I didn't know you had it in ya.
- I did.

51:01.400 --> 51:02.100
Hirsch...

51:02.600 --> 51:04.100
Hello. Oh...

51:04.600 --> 51:06.700
OK. All right.

51:07.200 --> 51:08.700
It's like a gum commercial.

51:08.800 --> 51:12.300
- You've ruined me for any other man.
- It's OK, you'll get over it.

51:13.800 --> 51:14.700
Call me.

51:14.800 --> 51:16.100
- Bye.
- Thank you.

51:21.000 --> 51:21.900
Hey, Hirsch...

51:22.400 --> 51:24.500
Who knew you were a freak in bed.

51:25.200 --> 51:25.900
Huh?

51:27.200 --> 51:29.300
Wow, ya gotta feel great, no?

51:29.600 --> 51:32.100
- I don't feel that great.
- Why the fuck not?

51:33.000 --> 51:37.100
I-I never went out on my wife before,
it makes me feel like a piece of shit.

51:37.200 --> 51:39.900
Hirschey, for Christ's sakes,
she been dead for ages.

51:40.000 --> 51:43.500

Hirsch, listen,
you're gonna have to give me your pants.

53:27.200 --> 53:27.900
Why?

53:28.000 --> 53:30.700
Because she's naked.
She's gonna need somethin' to wear.

53:30.800 --> 53:32.700
I'm not giving her my pants.
End of story.

53:32.800 --> 53:35.500
Come on, she's got no clothes on.
Give her your pants.

53:35.600 --> 53:37.100
You wanna give her some pants?
Give her your pants.

53:37.200 --> 53:38.700
No, I'm not gonna give her my pants.

53:38.800 --> 53:42.300
I gave her my jacket. My pants are
important to me. Gimme, give, come on.

53:42.400 --> 53:44.500
What makes you the arbiter
of whose pants are important,

53:44.600 --> 53:45.900
and whose pants are not important?

53:46.000 --> 53:49.100
You don't need pants.
You sit in the car driving. What the...

53:49.200 --> 53:51.100
- How the fuck you need pants to drive?
- I don't need pants?

53:51.200 --> 53:53.300
I gotta go out and walk around.
Come on, give...

53:53.400 --> 53:55.700
I'm not giving her my fucking pants!
End of story.

53:57.400 --> 54:01.300
- OK. So, that's your final offer?
- I'm not making any offers.

54:12.800 --> 54:15.300
OK, plan B... Doc!

54:17.200 --> 54:21.100
Song, how're you doing?
Do you sell women's clothing here?

54:22.400 --> 54:23.900
Do it look like it?

54:25.200 --> 54:29.300
My friend just asked you a question,
a polite question.

54:29.600 --> 54:31.500
Could you give him a polite answer?

54:31.600 --> 54:35.900
Ay, hijo chaqueta. You no hear so good,
old man, or you just stupid?

54:37.600 --> 54:40.700
- See that?
- Hey, your jab still looks pretty good.

54:40.800 --> 54:41.900
- You think so?
- Yeah.

54:42.000 --> 54:44.100
I thought I...
I didn't get my hips into it.

54:44.200 --> 54:46.500
No, no, no, it had a nice snap to it.

54:47.400 --> 54:48.700
Thanks for saying so.

54:49.800 --> 54:50.700
He's OK.

54:52.400 --> 54:54.100
- You need anything?
- Just my bill.

54:54.200 --> 54:56.700
I think we should know
certain things about her.

55:10.000 --> 55:10.900
Here she comes.

55:11.400 --> 55:13.300
Hey, look at that, clothes fit.

55:20.800 --> 55:23.500
- Feeling better?
- A little. Starvin'.

55:24.600 --> 55:29.300
Ahem, so, Sylvia, why don't we, uh,
continue where we left off?

55:30.400 --> 55:32.500
So I was standing, waiting for a cab.

55:33.400 --> 55:38.300
This car pulls up. Nice car. Nice smile.
Asked me if I needed a ride.

55:39.200 --> 55:40.700
I was late, so I said, "Sure."

55:40.800 --> 55:43.500
Wow, you know, you shouldn't
accept rides from strangers.

55:43.600 --> 55:47.500
- Go fuck yourself, all right?
- Hoo, ah, OK.

55:48.000 --> 55:50.300
"Go fuck yerself," I like this girl.

55:50.600 --> 55:53.100
There was another guy in the backseat
who I didn't see.

55:53.800 --> 55:55.900
He tied me up, took me to this warehouse

55:56.000 --> 55:59.500
There were two other guys there.
They were just laughing, whatever.

56:01.000 --> 56:04.500
Pretty soon, I was naked, and, uh,
figure out the rest.

56:05.200 --> 56:07.700
- So you never saw these guys before.
- Never.

56:08.400 --> 56:10.300
What do you think,
I put myself in the trunk?

56:11.000 --> 56:12.700
How's everybody doing over here?

56:12.800 --> 56:14.100
Good, thank you, Alex.

56:14.200 --> 56:16.300
Doc, I didn't know
you had so many friends.

56:16.400 --> 56:17.500
Me too.

56:17.800 --> 56:19.700
Well, let me know
if I can get you anything else.

56:19.800 --> 56:20.900
I'm fine, thanks.

56:21.200 --> 56:23.700
Anyway, I passed out for a while, and um

56:25.600 --> 56:27.300
woke up naked in the trunk of a car.

56:28.800 --> 56:32.500
Now I'm sittin' here with you three with
a friggin' Korean janitor outfit on.

56:34.400 --> 56:35.900
I had a dog named Sylvia.

56:37.600 --> 56:40.700
I loved that dog.
I think about her every day.

56:41.600 --> 56:43.900
There's so goddamned much I wanna forget

56:48.000 --> 56:49.500
Where was this warehouse?

56:50.200 --> 56:52.900
Show me where you found the car,
and I'll show you the place.

56:53.000 --> 56:57.500
We stole the car on Rodney Street,
belongs to the Jargoniew brothers.

56:57.800 --> 57:00.100
Total degenerate lowlifes.

57:01.200 --> 57:02.300
Animals.

57:03.200 --> 57:05.300
Maybe we could do somethin'
about this situation.

57:09.800 --> 57:11.300
So what do you guys wanna do about it?

57:13.800 --> 57:16.300
What, you're gonna fuck 'em up
with a pair of pliers?

57:16.800 --> 57:18.100
It's only the beginning.

57:20.000 --> 57:24.300
- Holy shit. Who are you guys?
- Remember that?

57:24.400 --> 57:28.500
- Oh, my baby, I've missed you.
- Mr. Hirsch...

57:29.200 --> 57:31.900
- Remember me? I do this.
- Uh-huh.

57:37.800 --> 57:41.500
- What time is it?
- I don't know. What time is it?

57:42.400 --> 57:43.700
It's time...

57:44.000 --> 57:45.500
to kick ass...

57:45.600 --> 57:46.900
or chew gum.

57:47.200 --> 57:48.500
And guess what?

57:50.200 --> 57:51.700
I'm all outta gum.

58:01.200 --> 58:03.100
- Hey, Val...
- Yeah.

58:03.200 --> 58:05.100
It's like the old days, isn't it?

58:05.800 --> 58:09.300
- No, it's better.
- Yeah, why?

58:10.200 --> 58:13.300
Because this time, we can appreciate it.

58:13.600 --> 58:17.500
- Yeah, that's right. That's the reason.
- See you soon.

58:18.600 --> 58:19.900
I'll be right here.

58:20.800 --> 58:25.300
- Yeah, OK, you see the place...
- Mm-hmm.

58:25.600 --> 58:29.100
You tell us, and then you take off, OK?

58:30.200 --> 58:33.700
We're just three people, walking
down the street, nothing suspicious.

58:33.800 --> 58:34.700
This is it.

58:35.800 --> 58:37.100
Around the corner.

58:39.400 --> 58:42.700
OK, you need to go home now, Sylvia.

58:42.800 --> 58:46.500
- No, I wanna watch.
- Oh, no, honey, nobody watches us work.

58:46.800 --> 58:50.500
Besides, there may be
five or six guys in there, you know.

58:50.600 --> 58:54.700
Just the two of us. It may not turn out
the way we would hope.

58:54.800 --> 58:58.500
- All right, so what? I-I can help.
- Go home, get some rest.

58:58.600 --> 59:00.700
- No.
- We can't know...

59:00.800 --> 59:02.900
- what's on the other side of that door.
- No... No.

59:03.800 --> 59:07.500
- I don't think she's gonna listen.
- No, she seems, uh, firm about it.

59:07.600 --> 59:09.900
- She's not gonna leave.
- Listen, honey...

59:11.000 --> 59:15.100
Why don't you wait here
about 10 minutes, and then come on in.

59:17.800 --> 59:19.500
Why are you doing this for me?

59:20.200 --> 59:22.100
I don't understand the question.

59:23.600 --> 59:25.100
You don't even know me.

59:25.800 --> 59:30.500
It's true,
but I know ya, at the same time.

59:31.200 --> 59:35.300
- Makes me sick, what they did to you.
- They're fuckin' animals.

59:35.400 --> 59:38.500
- There used to be consequences.
- Exactly.

59:39.000 --> 59:43.500
They think they can do things like this
to people, and get away with it.

59:43.800 --> 59:46.900
Well, we're the fuckin' consequences.

59:52.800 --> 59:54.900
And now for my next trick...

59:58.400 --> 59:59.700
Gimme those picks.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:07.300
It's probably open.

01:00:14.400 --> 01:00:15.300
You're right.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.700
Hey, fellas, what's going on?

01:00:59.800 --> 01:01:02.900
- Fuck did you get in here?
- We're friends of Sylvia.

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:06.900
Yeah, you remember Sylvia.
The naked girl you put in your trunk.

01:01:08.600 --> 01:01:11.300
The fuck you know about... trunk!

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:14.900
All right...

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:17.500
Anybody else wanna get shot?

01:01:25.200 --> 01:01:26.300
OK.

01:01:27.400 --> 01:01:28.900
Remember, fellas...

01:01:30.400 --> 01:01:32.300
You reap what you sow.

01:01:33.400 --> 01:01:37.500
Yes, I'd like to report
a large cache of weapons and drugs.

01:01:38.600 --> 01:01:39.900
What's the address here?

01:01:40.400 --> 01:01:43.300
- It's Rodney Street.
- I know that. What-what number?

01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:46.500
Oh, what's your number here?

01:01:49.600 --> 01:01:50.900
I asked you a question.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:52.900
- Go fuck yerself.
- Ooh...

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:56.300
I didn't hear the number.

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:01.100
- 172.
- 172.

01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:05.300
172 Rodney.
Thank you so much. Have a great night.

01:02:05.600 --> 01:02:07.500
You're your own worst fucking enemy.

01:02:12.800 --> 01:02:14.700
Oh... oh, dear.

01:02:25.400 --> 01:02:26.900
Oh, fuck.

01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:30.100
Good evening, gentlemen.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:32.100
Remember her?

01:02:33.400 --> 01:02:34.700
Belle of the ball.

01:02:36.200 --> 01:02:38.500
I think it's time for us to exit.

01:02:39.200 --> 01:02:40.300
Stage left.

01:02:42.400 --> 01:02:44.700
- OK, Sylvie...
- Yeah?

01:02:44.800 --> 01:02:47.500
You know, you got about eight minutes
before the cops call.

01:02:47.600 --> 01:02:48.300
Thank you.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:49.900
Good luck!

01:02:51.800 --> 01:02:53.900
- Good luck, fellas.
- Enjoy.

01:02:55.800 --> 01:02:57.900
You guys like the ballet, don't you?

01:02:59.600 --> 01:03:01.700
"The Nutcracker" was my favorite.

01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:08.300
Owwwww!

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:11.300
Here. Here's your gun back.

01:03:11.400 --> 01:03:15.900
- Ahhhhh!
- I got blood all over my jacket.

01:03:16.600 --> 01:03:17.700
Look at this.

01:03:18.400 --> 01:03:19.700
You can wash them.

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.300
You use the biological stuff.

01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:26.500
- It takes the stains right out.
- What the fuck is that, biological?

01:03:26.800 --> 01:03:28.900
I'm telling you,
it'll take that stain right out.

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:33.300
No, you can't get these stains out,
no matter how many times you wash 'em.

01:03:33.600 --> 01:03:37.500
A blood stain stays in.
You can't get this fucking stuff out.

01:03:39.800 --> 01:03:41.300
We'll get you a new suit.

01:03:42.200 --> 01:03:43.700
- A new suit?
- Yeah.

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:46.700
That's a different conversation.

01:03:48.800 --> 01:03:50.100
What's going on here?

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:52.900
What's this?

01:03:55.800 --> 01:03:56.500
Hey!

01:04:06.600 --> 01:04:09.700
- It's always somethin', ain't it?
- Yeah.

01:04:11.200 --> 01:04:14.700
- He got his last wish.
- Yeah.

01:04:15.600 --> 01:04:21.500
- We got to work together again.
- Yeah, we got to work together again.

01:04:26.200 --> 01:04:26.900
So...

01:04:29.800 --> 01:04:31.500
I think we should bury him.

01:04:35.800 --> 01:04:36.700
Hirsch.

01:04:41.800 --> 01:04:45.500
- Uh, you know where Nina Hirsch works?
- I think she's over there.

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:55.900
- Hey, Nina, remember us?
- Sure. How's your pecker?

01:04:56.200 --> 01:05:00.300
It's all right.
Uh, listen, uh, your dad's dead.

01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:06.700
- What?
- We're sorry.

01:05:07.600 --> 01:05:10.300
But, how do you know he's dead?

01:05:10.600 --> 01:05:15.900
Well, we-we-we took him for a night out
is all, and well, you know, he died.

01:05:21.200 --> 01:05:22.100
Where is he?

01:05:22.400 --> 01:05:26.700
He's outside in a stolen sports car,
in the front seat.

01:05:34.200 --> 01:05:36.700
- See?
- He's still warm.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:41.100
It didn't happen, uh,
more than 30 minutes ago.

01:05:49.800 --> 01:05:54.100
- What were you guys doing?
- Having fun just like old times.

01:05:54.800 --> 01:05:59.100
- He went out with a bang.
- Is there a family plot or something?

01:06:01.400 --> 01:06:03.300
We thought we should bury him.

01:06:06.800 --> 01:06:10.500
You... you wanna bury him now?

01:06:12.600 --> 01:06:13.500
Tonight?

01:06:14.400 --> 01:06:17.500
Well, for us, it's gotta be tonight.

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:21.300
They won't miss this.

01:06:23.600 --> 01:06:24.900
Give it to you, Hirsch.

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:27.500
Here you go, my boy.

01:06:31.600 --> 01:06:34.500
I think Hirsch will be glad
to be next to your mother.

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.100
He bought this plot when I was four.

01:06:40.600 --> 01:06:41.700
He told me...

01:06:43.400 --> 01:06:48.100
"Darlin', just come visit me from time
to time. Let me know how it's going."

01:06:49.600 --> 01:06:52.700
Dad, it's going OK.

01:06:54.400 --> 01:07:00.300
You taught me that the best thing
a person could be is of some use.

01:07:04.200 --> 01:07:06.300
You were of so much use to me.

01:07:10.400 --> 01:07:11.300
Always.

01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:20.100
Val, we should say something too.

01:07:21.800 --> 01:07:24.300
Would you do it.
I'm not good at stuff like this.

01:07:25.800 --> 01:07:26.500
Yeah.

01:07:27.800 --> 01:07:29.100
OK, I could do it.

01:07:30.200 --> 01:07:32.500
Uh, Hirsch was a good friend.

01:07:34.200 --> 01:07:38.700
I remember one time, uh,
we robbed this liquor store.

01:07:39.800 --> 01:07:42.900
And, he ran over a dog.

01:07:44.800 --> 01:07:48.300
He cried for two days over that dog.

01:07:51.200 --> 01:07:53.300
Anyway, he will be missed...

01:07:54.400 --> 01:07:57.900
by so many of us that God left behind.

01:08:00.600 --> 01:08:03.500
He was a witness to our lives.

01:08:04.400 --> 01:08:06.300
Not many of those left.

01:08:08.600 --> 01:08:11.300
So there's one less person on this earth

01:08:12.400 --> 01:08:17.300
who knows our name,
who remembers our childhood.

01:08:19.600 --> 01:08:25.300
Who shared in each moment as it passed.

01:08:27.200 --> 01:08:30.300
You know, they say, we die twice.

01:08:31.200 --> 01:08:34.300
Once, when the breath leaves our body,
and once...

01:08:35.399 --> 01:08:37.899
when the last person we know
says our name.

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:41.100
And then...

01:08:43.399 --> 01:08:47.899
Hirsch's life will be forgotten,
like all the other poor...

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:53.500
fucks that ever had the glory of livin'.

01:08:56.200 --> 01:08:57.500
Amen.

01:08:58.200 --> 01:09:00.100
- Amen.
- Amen.

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.899
- What?
- Nothing. That was really good.

01:09:09.399 --> 01:09:10.300
It was good?

01:09:11.800 --> 01:09:14.300
- Best I ever heard.
- You think so?

01:09:14.399 --> 01:09:16.500
- Really good, bro.
- Fuck you.

01:09:17.600 --> 01:09:21.500
- Thank you, Valentine.
- Uh yeah well, it was nothing. I just..

01:09:21.600 --> 01:09:24.100
No, Valentine, listen to me...

01:09:26.600 --> 01:09:28.700
- Thank you.
- It's OK.

01:09:29.800 --> 01:09:30.700
Thank you.

01:09:41.200 --> 01:09:42.100
Good night.

01:09:48.600 --> 01:09:51.100
- Nothing you could say about that.
- Nah.

01:09:56.000 --> 01:10:00.100
So, uh... you gonna do my eulogy?

01:10:01.400 --> 01:10:03.100
I'm working on it.

01:10:07.200 --> 01:10:08.900
How much time I got left?

01:10:11.600 --> 01:10:13.100
Four hours, about.

01:10:15.200 --> 01:10:19.500
Well, I could use a steak. You hungry?

01:10:19.600 --> 01:10:20.700
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

01:10:39.800 --> 01:10:43.700
And after breakfast,
we'll get you a new suit.

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:50.300
Then you can shoot me in the head,
so it doesn't fuck up my suit.

01:10:50.400 --> 01:10:52.700
That's right. I shoot you in the head.

01:10:53.800 --> 01:10:55.700
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:10:57.200 --> 01:10:59.700
Look at this. My car is still here.

01:11:01.200 --> 01:11:02.700
What, are you surprised?

01:11:03.200 --> 01:11:05.500
Who's gonna wanna take that
piece of shit?

01:11:08.200 --> 01:11:11.100
- Well, good morning, fellas.
- Hi, Alex.

01:11:11.400 --> 01:11:13.900
Now, are you two up early,
or are you going to bed late?

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.100
And what's going on here
with all this dirt?

01:11:16.101 --> 01:11:17.500
- Yeah, well, you know...
- Gardenin'.

01:11:17.600 --> 01:11:20.700
We've been doing a spot of
late night gardenin'.

01:11:20.800 --> 01:11:23.500
- Huh.
- Oh, yeah, you should try it some time.

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:28.100
Boy, you look at you, young lady. You're
pulling a long shift tonight, huh?

01:11:28.200 --> 01:11:30.100
Yeah, I don't sleep.

01:11:30.200 --> 01:11:33.100
I sort of like being awake when
everyone else is sleeping, you know?

01:11:33.200 --> 01:11:34.300
Gives me a sense of, um...

01:11:34.400 --> 01:11:36.300
- Being alive.
- Yes.

01:11:36.400 --> 01:11:40.700
- I know the feeling, believe me.
- OK, so, what'll it be, Doc?

01:11:40.800 --> 01:11:43.500
- Uh, two eggs over easy.
- Of course.

01:11:43.600 --> 01:11:49.100
And I will have a steak, waffles, uh,
Greek omelet, Greek salad, banana malt.

01:11:49.600 --> 01:11:52.700
- And another steak, and a coffee.
- And a coffee.

01:11:52.800 --> 01:11:53.900
- Oh, and a muffin.
- And a muffin.

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.500
- If you don't mind.
- I don't mind.

01:11:57.400 --> 01:12:02.700
- You are a very hungry man, Val.
- Uh, I'm leaving on a long trip.

01:12:03.600 --> 01:12:06.300
Oh, just when
we're gettin' to know each other.

01:12:06.400 --> 01:12:08.300
Uh, yeah, ain't that too bad.

01:12:08.400 --> 01:12:11.300
- Hmm, I'll put that order right in.
- Yeah.

01:12:12.600 --> 01:12:14.500
I'm gonna take a wild guess here,

01:12:14.800 --> 01:12:18.500
but Alex, the waitress,
is your granddaughter, no?

01:12:20.800 --> 01:12:21.700
Yes.

01:12:23.800 --> 01:12:26.100
- You gotta tell her.
- I'm going to.

01:12:26.200 --> 01:12:29.700
Oh, yeah? Why haven't you told already?

01:12:30.200 --> 01:12:31.900
- I can't.
- How come?

01:12:32.400 --> 01:12:33.300
You can.

01:12:34.400 --> 01:12:35.300
Believe me.

01:12:36.800 --> 01:12:40.500
- The truth will set you free, brother.
- OK, but not today.

01:12:40.600 --> 01:12:42.300
- Then when?
- Tomorrow.

01:12:43.800 --> 01:12:49.100
- Tomorrow. You promise?
- Tomorrow, tell her everything.

01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:52.700
OK, tomorrow.

01:12:54.600 --> 01:12:55.700
My last meal.

01:12:58.400 --> 01:12:59.300
Yeah.

01:13:04.600 --> 01:13:07.100
- Don't go sentimental on me now.
- Excuse me.

01:13:27.200 --> 01:13:29.300
- Here you go.
- Yeah.

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:31.900
Thank you.

01:13:33.400 --> 01:13:35.700
- So, Val...
- So, Alex...

01:13:35.800 --> 01:13:37.100
Do you mind if I sit?

01:13:38.400 --> 01:13:40.100
No, go ahead, please.

01:13:42.600 --> 01:13:44.700
So Doc comes in here
every morning, you know?

01:13:44.800 --> 01:13:45.500
Mm-hmm.

01:13:45.600 --> 01:13:47.700
And he always orders
the same exact thing.

01:13:48.400 --> 01:13:50.100
Oh, the tyranny of habit.

01:13:57.800 --> 01:13:58.700
<i>It's me.</i>

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:00.100
Is it done?

01:14:01.400 --> 01:14:02.500
What is he like?

01:14:03.400 --> 01:14:05.900
I can't help but wonder about
most of my customers, but...

01:14:06.800 --> 01:14:10.500
- I wonder about him the most.
- Well, I don't know, you know...

01:14:11.400 --> 01:14:13.700
What do you, uh,
what do you imagine he's like?

01:14:14.200 --> 01:14:19.900
Please, mercy, is all I'm saying, mercy.
I know it was your only son. I know what

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:21.100
<i>that must be like, but...</i>

01:14:21.200 --> 01:14:23.700
Please? Please?

01:14:23.800 --> 01:14:29.300
Please bring back my only son!
See how far "please" gets you!

01:14:29.800 --> 01:14:32.500
<i>We're all out of mercy here.</i>

01:14:32.600 --> 01:14:33.500
Why?

01:14:34.200 --> 01:14:38.100
He'll be dead soon enough. Just give him
a few more years. What's the difference?

01:14:38.200 --> 01:14:42.100
- What is the fucking difference?
- How's Alex, fuckface?

01:14:43.600 --> 01:14:44.300
What?

01:14:44.600 --> 01:14:46.300
Alex. You know who I'm talking about.

01:14:46.400 --> 01:14:49.700
I betcha my left nut,
you can see the bitch right this second.

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:54.700
<i>It would be a fucking shame
to see such a young honey get into</i>

01:14:54.800 --> 01:14:59.300
an awful accident. Fuckin' waste, yeah?

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.500
- You wouldn't.
- Oh, really?

01:15:05.200 --> 01:15:06.500
Are you sure?

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.900
I imagine he's a man who knows
what it's like to be alone.

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.100
To live life with a lot of regret.

01:15:13.200 --> 01:15:17.300
And, that maybe he comes here every day
just to be around other people.

01:15:17.400 --> 01:15:21.300
Even if it's only for a half an hour,
just, just to be around people.

01:15:22.200 --> 01:15:26.500
That's right. That's exactly right.
Sometimes...

01:15:26.800 --> 01:15:31.500
what we imagine
and the world aren't different things.

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.700
Sometimes they're the same, exact thing.

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:38.100
Yeah, I thought so.

01:15:39.200 --> 01:15:44.300
Finish this fucknut,
or accidents can, and will happen.

01:16:18.800 --> 01:16:22.500
I think your food is ready. You know,
I wish we could've talked more, Val.

01:16:22.600 --> 01:16:24.300
Me too.
It was nice sittin' here with you.

01:16:24.400 --> 01:16:25.300
Yeah, it was.

01:16:47.200 --> 01:16:48.700
Is this church open?

01:16:50.400 --> 01:16:51.900
Church is always open.

01:16:54.200 --> 01:16:54.900
Yeah?

01:17:15.800 --> 01:17:19.100
So, you start or do I start, I-I forgot.

01:17:19.200 --> 01:17:23.900
- Uh, you do.
- I do. Right, OK, so, um...

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:28.700
- forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.
- How long since your last confession?

01:17:29.200 --> 01:17:33.700
Um, 60 years, give or take a few.

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:35.700
OK.

01:17:36.400 --> 01:17:39.900
Now, confess each and every serious sin
that separates you from Christ.

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.900
Oh, no, no, or we'd be here forever.

01:17:43.400 --> 01:17:46.900
Father, can we just deal
with what happened today.

01:17:48.400 --> 01:17:49.500
So far...

01:17:50.800 --> 01:17:54.500
I shot a guy in the kneecap,
and one in the arm.

01:17:55.200 --> 01:17:56.500
I, uh...

01:17:56.600 --> 01:18:01.300
stole a bunch of prescription drugs,
and a sweet-ass car.

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:07.500
Punched a Korean store clerk
in the face, and took his clothes.

01:18:07.800 --> 01:18:10.300
And fucked a Russian hooker, four times.

01:18:11.600 --> 01:18:12.500
That was all...

01:18:13.200 --> 01:18:15.900
- today?
- Uh...

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.300
since noon yesterday, yeah.

01:18:18.400 --> 01:18:21.700
But I did some good things too, Father.
I-I, uh...

01:18:22.400 --> 01:18:25.900
I buried a friend. I, uh...

01:18:26.400 --> 01:18:31.900
helped this young woman
take her life back, and, uh...

01:18:32.600 --> 01:18:36.300
I eased my best friend's pain.

01:18:38.800 --> 01:18:39.700
And for...

01:18:40.600 --> 01:18:42.100
28 years...

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.100
I kept my mouth shut.

01:18:53.400 --> 01:18:54.100
So...

01:18:54.600 --> 01:18:56.900
can I say a Hail Mary and be done here?

01:18:58.600 --> 01:19:03.900
I don't think that you're gonna be able
to Hail Mary your way outta this one.

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:07.900
You're right.

01:19:09.600 --> 01:19:11.100
You're right, I guess.

01:19:12.800 --> 01:19:14.500
Wasting both our time.

01:19:16.400 --> 01:19:17.500
Here, go ahead...

01:19:18.400 --> 01:19:20.500
- Why don't you take this?
- What's that?

01:19:20.600 --> 01:19:21.700
- It's for your troubles.
- No, oh, no.

01:19:21.800 --> 01:19:24.700
- No, no... buy yourself a steak dinner.
- I'm a vegetarian.

01:19:24.800 --> 01:19:25.900
Take it, Father.

01:19:26.600 --> 01:19:28.300
I don't need it where I'm goin'.

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:41.700
What?

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:42.700
So?

01:19:45.800 --> 01:19:47.500
Receive absolution?

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:50.300
Well, close enough.

01:19:52.600 --> 01:19:54.500
Let's go see about those suits.

01:19:56.400 --> 01:19:57.500
You wanna hurry up?

01:20:09.200 --> 01:20:10.300
What about this one?

01:20:10.400 --> 01:20:13.700
Why?
Am I gonna play a game of shuffleboard?

01:20:13.800 --> 01:20:16.300
Come on,
let's-let's-let's be serious here.

01:20:16.800 --> 01:20:17.500
OK.

01:20:17.600 --> 01:20:20.100
- We came here for a suit, find a suit
- Hey, this one.

01:20:21.600 --> 01:20:23.100
All right, wha-what size is it?

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.500
- 42 Long.
- I wear 40 Regular.

01:20:32.800 --> 01:20:33.900
Hey...

01:20:36.400 --> 01:20:38.700
You said, "No crying."

01:20:39.200 --> 01:20:42.500
No crying for you.
We didn't say anything about me.

01:20:46.800 --> 01:20:49.100
OK. Hey! This one.

01:20:53.800 --> 01:20:56.900
- It's beautiful. Lemme have it a sec.
- It'll look great on you.

01:20:57.200 --> 01:20:59.500
Cloths just hang off you the right way.

01:20:59.600 --> 01:21:01.300
- You think so?
- Definitely.

01:21:02.600 --> 01:21:05.300
- Why don't you try one on?
- Nah, I'm OK.

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:07.900
No, your wardrobe could use a lil' help.

01:21:08.600 --> 01:21:09.700
You think?

01:21:10.200 --> 01:21:14.100
Uh, yeah,
I wasn't gonna say anything, but, uh...

01:21:14.200 --> 01:21:16.300
- Yeah, but what?
- What?

01:21:16.400 --> 01:21:20.100
You dress like you're on your way to the
Gin Rummy Championship for the World.

01:21:20.200 --> 01:21:23.100
- Here.
- Uh-uh, I prefer black.

01:21:24.400 --> 01:21:27.100
You're right, black suits you.

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.900
Here's black, what do you think?

01:21:34.200 --> 01:21:37.100
I can't see myself wearing that,
like every day, you know.

01:21:37.200 --> 01:21:38.900
I-I-I don't see myself in it.

01:21:41.400 --> 01:21:43.100
Will you look at these guys, Paul?

01:21:43.600 --> 01:21:46.500
Look at 'em, they're trying on clothes.

01:21:47.600 --> 01:21:49.700
- You fucking shoppin'?
- What?

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:51.300
What do you mean "what"?

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:53.900
Isn't there something else
you're supposed to be doing?

01:21:55.200 --> 01:21:57.100
You know Claphands had you figured, Doc.

01:21:57.200 --> 01:21:59.300
See, you don't got the stones any more.

01:21:59.800 --> 01:22:02.500
Whoa! Larry, please.

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.700
If we do this,
there's one thing you should know.

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:09.700
Hey! Here! Here!

01:22:20.600 --> 01:22:21.500
You...

01:22:22.600 --> 01:22:24.300
Call Claphands...

01:22:24.600 --> 01:22:25.500
Tell him...

01:22:25.800 --> 01:22:27.500
Stay out of my action.

01:22:27.800 --> 01:22:29.300
I got this.

01:22:29.600 --> 01:22:30.500
OK.

01:22:33.200 --> 01:22:34.900
- Go.
- Yeah.

01:22:43.600 --> 01:22:44.500
Nice work.

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:48.300
The old days,
I'da had him with the throat punch.

01:22:48.800 --> 01:22:52.300
You gotta admit,
it felt good though, didn't it?

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:53.900
Damn right.

01:22:55.200 --> 01:22:56.100
Felt good.

01:22:58.200 --> 01:23:01.300
Oh, look at you. You look great.

01:23:02.200 --> 01:23:04.100
No, you look great.

01:23:04.600 --> 01:23:05.900
- Do I?
- Yeah.

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:08.500
Well, I feel great.

01:23:09.800 --> 01:23:14.300
That's what I'm saying, you know, a
change of wardrobe can be just the thing

01:23:14.400 --> 01:23:16.100
- Definitely.
- Yeah.

01:23:20.800 --> 01:23:22.900
- May I?
- Be my guest.

01:23:26.200 --> 01:23:29.300
- Boom!
- Whoa! I could hear the... Fuck!

01:23:30.400 --> 01:23:31.500
- You see that?
- I did.

01:23:31.600 --> 01:23:33.700
It wa..., it was good though, huh?
I got my hips in.

01:23:35.200 --> 01:23:36.300
He's still alive.

01:23:39.800 --> 01:23:41.500
- So...
- So...

01:23:42.200 --> 01:23:43.300
What time is it?

01:23:44.400 --> 01:23:45.300
It's time.

01:23:48.200 --> 01:23:49.100
Already?

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:53.100
I'm sorry.

01:23:54.655 --> 01:23:57.300
- Well, he had it coming, didn't he?
- He didn't.

01:23:59.800 --> 01:24:01.300
Time waits for no man.

01:24:02.400 --> 01:24:03.300
Doesn't.

01:24:04.200 --> 01:24:05.100
Mm-hmm.

01:24:14.400 --> 01:24:16.300
I'm gonna miss the spring.

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:20.700
And my flowers.

01:24:21.800 --> 01:24:23.700
The birds returning.

01:24:24.800 --> 01:24:26.300
Their song.

01:24:27.200 --> 01:24:28.300
The whole world.

01:24:29.200 --> 01:24:31.700
You know, renewin' itself again.

01:24:32.600 --> 01:24:34.300

<i>Alex...</i>

01:25:45.800 --> 01:25:48.100
What do you think of my "Sunrises"?

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:53.700
I think they're beautiful.

I do.

01:26:06.400 --> 01:26:09.900
I know they look like the sunrise,
but I was painting you.

01:26:21.200 --> 01:26:22.100
OK.

01:26:59.200 --> 01:27:01.100
Doc, this is too much.

01:27:01.600 --> 01:27:03.700
No, it's all there is.

01:27:04.800 --> 01:27:08.100
Welcome home,
the rent is paid for a year.

01:27:09.400 --> 01:27:11.300
It's not much, but it's yours.

01:27:12.600 --> 01:27:14.900
What do you mean?
When am I gonna see you again?

01:27:15.200 --> 01:27:16.300
<i>I don't know.</i>

01:27:19.800 --> 01:27:21.700
I love you, Alex.

01:27:22.600 --> 01:27:23.700
<i>Grandpa...</i>

01:27:24.600 --> 01:27:25.900
I love you too.

01:27:27.800 --> 01:27:28.900
I have to go now.

01:27:52.800 --> 01:27:55.100
You sure you wanna do this?

01:27:56.400 --> 01:27:58.500
You can change your mind, you know?

01:27:59.400 --> 01:28:01.300
I know, but I won't.

01:28:04.600 --> 01:28:06.300
You took care of Alex?

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:09.700
I'm so proud of you for that.

01:28:10.800 --> 01:28:12.500

01:28:23.600 --> 01:28:26.700
Chew gum or kick ass?

01:28:26.800 --> 01:28:28.500
I'm all outta gum.

01:28:40.600 --> 01:28:41.700
