11:26.268 --> 11:28.104
Rick, we don't even know
if I'm pregnant yet.

11:28.187 --> 11:29.647
It doesn't matter.

11:29.730 --> 11:34.026
I don't care.
I love you.

11:34.110 --> 11:38.155
[high-pitched voice]
I love you, too, and, yes,
I will marry you!"

11:44.537 --> 11:46.122
Val..

11:47.206 --> 11:49.708
...will you marry me?

11:49.792 --> 11:53.003
Yes. Yes, I would
love to marry you.

11:53.087 --> 11:55.631
Oh, we're getting married!

11:55.714 --> 11:58.300
Hey, come on, buddy,
this is a beautiful moment.

11:58.384 --> 11:59.718
Put on some music.

12:00.678 --> 12:03.264
[Indian music]

12:06.475 --> 12:08.394
This will always be your song.

12:13.315 --> 12:15.943
[instrumental music]

12:17.945 --> 12:20.322
You know, it's one thing
to lose her to Henry.

12:20.406 --> 12:23.534
I mean, I like Henry.
I could almost deal with that.

12:23.617 --> 12:26.787
But this dude,
oh-oh, with his black hair

12:26.871 --> 12:30.666
blue eyes, that guitar hanging
off his bony-ass shoulder.

12:30.750 --> 12:32.084
He's all..

12:32.168 --> 12:33.586
Holly's?

12:34.587 --> 12:35.796
[knocking on door]

12:35.880 --> 12:37.339
Coming.

12:40.217 --> 12:43.095
Uh-oh. It's black hair
bony-ass's girlfriend.

12:43.179 --> 12:44.722
Damn it.

12:44.805 --> 12:46.891
I can't deal with this now.

12:48.058 --> 12:49.685
- Holly!
- Gary, hey!

12:49.768 --> 12:51.645
- What's up, girl?
- What are you doing here?

12:51.729 --> 12:53.439
Well, I moved in with Vince
over the summer.

12:53.522 --> 12:55.441
Oh, my gosh,
are you and Vince dating?

12:55.524 --> 12:58.235
Because that would
make my life so much easier.

13:01.071 --> 13:03.032
Holly.

13:05.201 --> 13:06.911
You're back.

13:06.994 --> 13:09.038
Gary, why didn't
you tell me we had company?

13:09.121 --> 13:11.207
I would've put a shirt on.

13:18.088 --> 13:20.424
That is the pinkest boy
I've ever seen.

13:23.719 --> 13:25.554
So, um, listen,
I just got home

13:25.638 --> 13:27.556
and Henry was waiting
for me at the airport.

13:27.640 --> 13:29.892
Henry was at the airport?
What a chick.

13:29.975 --> 13:31.894
[chuckling]
Yeah.

13:31.977 --> 13:34.897
So, um, listen, Vince,
I have to tell you something.

13:34.980 --> 13:36.524
Oh, can,
can I go first?

13:36.607 --> 13:38.609
Oh. Yeah, okay.

13:38.692 --> 13:40.444
Listen, Holly.

13:42.321 --> 13:46.075
What we had in Paris
was really, really great.

13:46.158 --> 13:49.787
Oh, God,
now I'm 3-3.

13:49.870 --> 13:52.665
Holly, you're the most
fantastic girl I've ever known.

13:52.748 --> 13:54.250
No.

13:55.292 --> 13:58.045
- But I moved on.
- What?

13:58.128 --> 14:01.423
I'm sorry, but I can't
commit to just one girl.

14:02.508 --> 14:05.261
I love all girls.

14:05.344 --> 14:08.722
And why shouldn't you?
Girls are great.

14:08.806 --> 14:11.767
Oh, yeah. Tall ones, short ones,
redheads, brunettes.

14:11.850 --> 14:14.645
I can't stop. They're like
freakin' pistachio nuts.

14:14.728 --> 14:17.648
You know, Vince,
this is actually fantastic

14:17.731 --> 14:20.234
because...I didn't know
how to tell you this.

14:21.026 --> 14:22.528
I met someone in London.

14:23.612 --> 14:25.489
You met someone?

14:27.157 --> 14:29.660
Holly, that's awesome!
Oh!

14:29.743 --> 14:31.620
And, Vince, I think
you'll really like him.

14:31.704 --> 14:34.415
'His name is Ben.
He's sweet and funny.'

14:34.498 --> 14:36.292
Sounds like a keeper.

14:36.375 --> 14:39.128
Wow, okay, I hate to cut this
short, but I gotta get going.

14:39.211 --> 14:40.879
Oh, okay.
Well, we should all hang out.

14:40.963 --> 14:43.549
I'd love to, but I've been
really busy these days.

14:43.632 --> 14:46.468
Oh, okay.
What about next Saturday?

14:46.552 --> 14:48.637
- I think it's a redhead.
- Oh, okay.

14:48.721 --> 14:50.180
Well, we've gotta
find sometime.

14:50.264 --> 14:52.182
I mean, we have
so much to catch up on.

14:52.266 --> 14:55.144
- I.. You know, Holly..
- Oh..

14:55.227 --> 14:57.646
I've got stuff goin' on,
you've got the boyfriend.

14:57.730 --> 14:59.023
I-I-I'll see you around.

14:59.106 --> 15:00.691
- Okay?
- Oh, yeah. Okay.

15:00.774 --> 15:03.652
- Okay.
- Oh, well, it is great.

15:03.736 --> 15:04.987
Good.

15:12.828 --> 15:14.830
[timer dings]

15:14.913 --> 15:16.582
Oh, God, this is it.

15:16.665 --> 15:19.585
Oh, actually,
I think that's my fajita.

15:21.420 --> 15:23.631
No, it's all yours.

15:28.385 --> 15:30.137
I'm not pregnant.

15:35.601 --> 15:37.269
You sure?

15:38.979 --> 15:40.939
I'm so sorry.

15:41.023 --> 15:43.525
You know what? I think
you two need to be alone.

15:43.609 --> 15:45.861
And this is totally
for the best.

15:45.944 --> 15:48.989
I mean, a pregnant bride,
a little slutty.

15:52.951 --> 15:54.787
So..

15:54.870 --> 15:56.872
You okay?

15:56.955 --> 16:00.125
Yeah, I really am.

16:00.209 --> 16:02.378
- You?
- Yeah.

16:02.461 --> 16:04.088
Now it'll be a lot easier
to carry my bride

16:04.171 --> 16:06.674
over the threshold.

16:06.757 --> 16:09.051
You don't still
want to get married?

16:09.134 --> 16:10.844
Yeah.

16:10.928 --> 16:12.805
Eh.. Don't you?

16:15.224 --> 16:17.643
[instrumental music]

16:25.442 --> 16:27.361
Hi, it's Holly.

16:27.444 --> 16:30.906
If I ever dated you,
then I'm so sorry.

16:30.989 --> 16:32.241
And if you'd like
to tell me off

16:32.324 --> 16:34.910
please do so after the beep.

16:34.993 --> 16:36.662
Beep.

16:39.331 --> 16:41.583
[knocking on door]

16:46.463 --> 16:47.589
Henry.

16:47.673 --> 16:49.758
Um, I'm leaving
for Princeton

16:49.842 --> 16:51.593
and I've got
a cab waiting downstairs.

16:51.677 --> 16:52.928
You're leaving tonight?

16:53.011 --> 16:57.057
Uh, listen,
I-I just came by to, uh..

16:59.476 --> 17:03.272
[sighs]
Wow, this would be
so much easier

17:03.355 --> 17:05.398
if you just liked me.

17:05.482 --> 17:07.608
Henry, I am so sorry.

17:07.693 --> 17:09.611
I didn't think
about how you'd really feel

17:09.694 --> 17:12.156
and I should have.

17:12.239 --> 17:13.449
You know what's gonna happen.

17:13.531 --> 17:15.576
- Don't you?
- What?

17:15.659 --> 17:18.162
Someone awesome is gonna
fall in love with you.

17:18.244 --> 17:19.579
Really?

17:19.663 --> 17:21.665
Is she gonna be
more awesome than you?

17:21.749 --> 17:25.210
- Way.
- Is she gonna wanna have sex?

17:25.294 --> 17:27.171
Tons.

17:27.253 --> 17:29.089
With me?

17:32.134 --> 17:35.137
You know, Henry,
there's something you gave me

17:35.220 --> 17:37.514
that no one else
in my entire life

17:37.598 --> 17:39.683
can ever give me.

17:39.767 --> 17:41.518
What's that?

17:41.602 --> 17:43.729
I'll never have
another first love.

17:44.980 --> 17:47.149
Don't say another word.

17:47.232 --> 17:49.985
- I wanna leave with that.
- Mm.

17:51.278 --> 17:52.696
[chuckles]

18:00.788 --> 18:02.581
You handled that really well.

18:02.664 --> 18:05.000
Thanks.

18:05.083 --> 18:07.503
It doesn't make me feel
any better.

18:07.586 --> 18:11.340
I made you
a welcome back cake.

18:11.423 --> 18:13.592
Did you think about baking it?

18:14.802 --> 18:16.887
Yeah, I got
a little side-tracked.

18:16.970 --> 18:20.724
- What happened?
- Let's see. Uh..

18:20.808 --> 18:23.060
I mixed the batter,
thought I was pregnant

18:23.143 --> 18:25.646
Rick proposed,
I said yes, the test said no

18:25.729 --> 18:27.231
broke off the engagement,
Rick walked out

18:27.314 --> 18:28.774
you walked in
and here we are.

18:28.857 --> 18:31.610
- Spoon?
- Okay, wait, wait, what?

18:31.693 --> 18:33.862
Holly, he was only
proposing to me

18:33.946 --> 18:35.364
because he thought
I was pregnant.

18:35.447 --> 18:37.032
He was just trying
to be a good guy.

18:37.115 --> 18:39.243
Okay, you're freaking me out.
Start from the beginning.

18:39.326 --> 18:41.036
Oh, come on, can we talk
about this later?

18:41.119 --> 18:43.205
You're really killing
my batter buzz.

18:43.288 --> 18:47.125
Val, are you using batter
to avoid your feelings again?

18:48.836 --> 18:50.504
It's chocolate.

18:50.587 --> 18:52.798
So, I guess, I didn't
make your day any easier.

18:54.174 --> 18:56.927
Yes, you did.
You came home.

18:59.054 --> 19:01.181
- I love you.
- Thank you.

19:02.015 --> 19:03.225
Hey, can I have a slice?

19:03.308 --> 19:05.936
- Sure. Here.
- Thanks.

19:08.981 --> 19:11.567
Well, just so you know,
when you're ready

19:11.650 --> 19:14.069
I can really
help you through this.

19:14.153 --> 19:15.404
I'll be fine.

19:15.487 --> 19:18.365
Val, you could really use
a new perspective.

19:18.448 --> 19:21.201
I think you could benefit
from a trip to Europe.

19:21.285 --> 19:23.495
I mean, I've really grown up.

19:23.579 --> 19:26.707
When I left for Paris,
I was just a kid.

19:27.666 --> 19:29.918
You mean, in June?

19:30.002 --> 19:32.880
I don't think
you're taking me seriously.

19:51.940 --> 19:54.860
That's real mature.
You learn that in Europe?

19:58.864 --> 20:01.742
Nope, but I learned that.

20:02.451 --> 20:04.494
Mm-hmm.

20:08.123 --> 20:09.958
I am so sorry.

20:10.042 --> 20:13.462
I got that all over
your new pretty French blouse.

20:13.545 --> 20:15.714
Mm, well, don't be.

20:15.797 --> 20:18.592
I bought it
with your credit card.

20:23.388 --> 20:25.140
Pretty.

20:30.020 --> 20:31.772
Give me that!

20:32.397 --> 20:35.025
[screaming]

20:40.238 --> 20:42.324
God bless America.

20:43.283 --> 20:45.786
[instrumental music]

20:49.247 --> 20:51.583
[theme music]

21:08.266 --> 21:11.353
[music continues]
