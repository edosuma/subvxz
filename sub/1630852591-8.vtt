00:32.741 --> 00:33.950
<i>Um…</i>

00:34.034 --> 00:35.452
<i>When I grow up,</i>

00:35.535 --> 00:36.911
<i>I wanna be…</i>

00:39.205 --> 00:40.123
<i>a bird.</i>

00:42.000 --> 00:44.961
<i>Who can fly away from here and…</i>

00:45.712 --> 00:46.921
<i>see everything</i>

00:47.672 --> 00:48.840
<i>from the sky.</i>

00:51.342 --> 00:52.469
<i>What about you?</i>

00:56.014 --> 00:56.890
Um…

01:42.977 --> 01:44.813
Let me the fuck out of here!

01:44.896 --> 01:45.939
Hey!

01:47.232 --> 01:48.191
Hey!

01:48.733 --> 01:50.110
Let me out of here!

01:50.652 --> 01:51.653
Hey!

01:52.779 --> 01:53.738
Hey!

01:54.405 --> 01:56.241
Let me the fuck out of here!

01:58.034 --> 01:59.828
I don't belong here!

02:00.578 --> 02:01.538
Hey!

02:01.621 --> 02:03.498
Let me the fuck out of here!

02:04.124 --> 02:06.584
Fuck. What the fuck is happening?

02:14.342 --> 02:17.053
-What the fuck am I doing in here?
-Look, I am so sorry.

02:17.137 --> 02:19.848
You're part of it, aren't you?
Samuel's cult?

02:19.931 --> 02:21.683
-He told you to bring me here?
-No.

02:21.766 --> 02:24.269
I brought you here because
it's the only way to keep you safe.

02:24.352 --> 02:26.312
-You're a fucking liar.
-Melody.

02:26.396 --> 02:28.189
I got the tapes you sent me.

02:29.649 --> 02:31.693
And the man I saw at the séance,

02:32.402 --> 02:33.486
I know him.

02:34.070 --> 02:35.530
But not as Samuel.

02:35.613 --> 02:39.409
He introduced himself
as Alexander Davenport.

02:39.492 --> 02:40.451
What?

02:40.535 --> 02:43.121
That researcher that I met
on the message board,

02:43.913 --> 02:46.291
the historian studying the Baldung line,

02:46.374 --> 02:47.417
that's him.

02:47.500 --> 02:48.543
Same man.

02:48.626 --> 02:52.088
He knew <i>everything</i> about me.

02:53.464 --> 02:54.883
Where I was from.

02:54.966 --> 02:57.760
How I grew up. That I've been
looking for my birth mother.

02:57.844 --> 03:00.430
Look, I never gave him
access to your information.

03:00.513 --> 03:02.432
It was completely anonymous.

03:02.515 --> 03:05.101
That fucking psycho
sent the letter to the convent.

03:05.185 --> 03:08.104
He used her as bait
to lure me to the building.

03:09.981 --> 03:11.733
Look, he is delusional.

03:12.317 --> 03:14.027
Okay? He thinks he needs you.

03:14.110 --> 03:15.486
That's why I brought you here.

03:15.570 --> 03:17.280
You are safe here.

03:17.363 --> 03:20.158
I don't want to be locked up
in a fucking psych ward.

03:20.241 --> 03:23.828
Look, just give me a few hours, okay?
I'm gonna get you out of the city.

03:23.912 --> 03:26.039
I have some friends
at Washington University.

03:26.122 --> 03:28.458
They can shelter you
until all of this blows over.

03:28.541 --> 03:29.709
He took Jess.

03:32.003 --> 03:33.713
-What do you mean he took her?
-He took her.

03:33.796 --> 03:36.132
He thinks he needs me,
but he's going to use her too

03:36.216 --> 03:38.843
in some fucked-up ritual in the basement.

03:39.928 --> 03:42.680
He's been grooming her for years.

03:43.681 --> 03:45.266
We have to help her.

03:46.893 --> 03:48.519
Okay. Um…

03:48.603 --> 03:51.105
I'll call Child Protective Services.
They'll send someone over.

03:51.189 --> 03:53.399
They're gonna send
a fucking social worker.

03:53.483 --> 03:56.236
-What's a social worker going to do?
-Look, I'll handle it.

03:56.319 --> 03:57.654
All right? I promise.

03:57.737 --> 03:59.072
I don't believe you.

04:02.909 --> 04:04.077
Look, Melody…

04:06.371 --> 04:08.456
I never meant to put you in any danger.

04:08.539 --> 04:11.709
Let me the fuck out of here.

04:15.964 --> 04:18.258
There's someone you need to see first.

04:19.467 --> 04:21.844
<i>Dr. Lewis to Mental Health Services.</i>

04:21.928 --> 04:24.389
<i>Dr. Lewis to Mental Health Services.</i>

04:36.818 --> 04:37.860
Anabelle?

04:44.450 --> 04:45.410
Mel!

04:46.995 --> 04:49.247
Yay, you're here.

04:50.206 --> 04:52.500
Oh, thank God.

04:52.583 --> 04:53.960
Are you okay?

04:54.627 --> 04:56.838
-What took you so long?
-I'm so sorry.

04:56.921 --> 04:59.215
I meant to come back
the other night, but I--

05:01.384 --> 05:02.677
Oh, what?

05:05.388 --> 05:06.389
Shit.

05:06.931 --> 05:09.434
Goddamn it, Steven.

05:11.894 --> 05:13.187
I already tried that.

05:13.271 --> 05:14.564
It doesn't work.

05:20.778 --> 05:22.155
What is all this?

05:23.364 --> 05:25.491
They wouldn't bring me any more paper,

05:25.575 --> 05:28.953
so I just draw on the walls.

05:31.956 --> 05:33.416
I know who this is.

05:35.543 --> 05:36.627
You do?

05:36.711 --> 05:39.255
She did something terrible
a long time ago.

05:41.215 --> 05:43.468
What… What… What did she do?

05:44.594 --> 05:46.012
She murdered someone.

05:49.682 --> 05:51.351
They can't let her out then.

05:52.268 --> 05:53.561
Anabelle.

05:53.644 --> 05:55.271
-It's okay, she's dead.
-No.

05:55.355 --> 05:56.939
No, she's not. She's in there.

05:57.023 --> 05:58.107
In where?

05:58.191 --> 05:59.859
The other place. The…

06:00.485 --> 06:01.903
The Otherworld.

06:01.986 --> 06:04.530
She… She calls to me, Mel.

06:04.614 --> 06:06.616
She's in there and she wants out.

06:06.699 --> 06:08.743
She wants to come home tonight.

06:08.826 --> 06:09.869
Tonight?

06:10.370 --> 06:11.579
How do you know that?

06:12.372 --> 06:14.040
Because the ferryman's here.

06:17.168 --> 06:18.127
He's…

06:20.046 --> 06:23.132
You can't see him anymore, but…

06:24.634 --> 06:26.010
he's up there.

06:27.095 --> 06:28.179
The comet?

06:28.262 --> 06:29.305
The comet…

06:30.056 --> 06:32.100
The comet opens the door.

06:32.934 --> 06:35.978
Cassandra told me.
They're going open the door tonight.

06:36.062 --> 06:38.564
The ritual is happening tonight?
I have to get out of--

06:38.648 --> 06:40.691
No, no. No, no, no, no!
Mel, stay… Stay with me.

06:40.775 --> 06:42.735
I can't. I have to go back for Jess.

06:43.903 --> 06:45.154
I'm sorry.

06:46.155 --> 06:48.157
I fucked everything up, Anabelle.

06:48.741 --> 06:50.743
But I can still save Jess.

07:05.091 --> 07:06.926
She flew out the window?

07:07.510 --> 07:08.803
That's how I remember it.

07:09.887 --> 07:11.013
Are you sure?

07:11.889 --> 07:15.309
I may have faked a heart attack
and had a nurse open the door.

07:15.393 --> 07:18.396
No, no, I mean the stuff
about Dr. Turner, my father.

07:18.479 --> 07:20.314
Are you sure he wasn't part of it?
He wasn't…

07:20.398 --> 07:22.817
He wasn't working with Samuel?
He was trying to help her?

07:22.900 --> 07:24.360
That's what she said.

07:25.611 --> 07:29.532
Okay, if we could just, uh,
steer this ship back into open waters…

07:29.615 --> 07:30.575
Um…

07:32.118 --> 07:34.912
What about these?
How long have you been painting Melody?

07:35.496 --> 07:36.497
Long time.

07:37.123 --> 07:37.999
Forever.

07:38.875 --> 07:40.168
I hear her calling.

07:43.504 --> 07:44.922
Anabelle, um…

07:46.090 --> 07:49.343
Melody, she died in the fire
at the Visser.

07:49.427 --> 07:50.470
You know that, right?

07:50.553 --> 07:52.847
No, she didn't die.

07:52.930 --> 07:54.390
She wants to come home.

07:55.057 --> 07:57.101
She needs you to find her.

07:57.852 --> 07:59.562
Where? How?

07:59.645 --> 08:01.522
You guys want sandwiches?

08:01.606 --> 08:03.399
I can get them to bring sandwiches.

08:04.317 --> 08:06.611
Peanut butter, ham, marshmallow.

08:07.195 --> 08:08.905
You name it, they have it.

08:08.988 --> 08:11.824
Um, I think we're gonna
pass on the sandwiches this time,

08:11.908 --> 08:13.034
but maybe next time.

08:13.117 --> 08:15.244
Oh, I almost forgot.

08:15.328 --> 08:16.204
Jess.

08:16.287 --> 08:18.372
Jess? Jess Lewis? What about her?

08:18.456 --> 08:20.666
Uh, she left something for you.

08:20.750 --> 08:21.751
For me?

08:22.793 --> 08:24.420
I want you to have it.

08:25.588 --> 08:27.715
I looked for Jessica Lewis.
I found nothing.

08:27.798 --> 08:29.300
Either she died or…

08:29.383 --> 08:32.011
She's, uh, Sister Mary Cecilia now.

08:32.094 --> 08:34.722
She came to see me
just before she left for Haiti

08:34.805 --> 08:36.349
and she said she couldn't take those

08:36.432 --> 08:38.476
and she wanted
to make sure they were safe.

08:39.894 --> 08:40.811
Mix tapes?

08:41.354 --> 08:42.855
What's on them?

08:42.939 --> 08:44.565
How the fuck should I know?

09:28.192 --> 09:30.945
Fisher-Price PXL2000.

09:32.363 --> 09:34.699
Shitty quality video camera for kids. I…

09:35.700 --> 09:37.743
It was only
on the market for about a year.

09:37.827 --> 09:39.870
I got one on eBay about ten years ago.

09:40.413 --> 09:41.372
Jess had one.

09:42.123 --> 09:44.125
They shoot on audio cassettes.

09:48.254 --> 09:49.463
<i>What about you?</i>

09:52.216 --> 09:53.217
<i>I just…</i>

09:57.805 --> 09:59.140
<i>I want to be happy,</i>

09:59.724 --> 10:00.641
<i>I guess.</i>

10:03.894 --> 10:04.979
Shit.

10:18.868 --> 10:19.910
Okay.

10:30.755 --> 10:32.590
<i>My name is Melody Pendras.</i>

10:32.673 --> 10:35.468
<i>I live in apartment 2C</i>
<i>at the Visser Apartments.</i>

10:36.010 --> 10:37.511
<i>I'm of sound mind.</i>

10:37.595 --> 10:39.513
<i>To any law enforcement officers,</i>

10:39.597 --> 10:43.517
<i>I'm making this tape as I search</i>
<i>for fellow resident Jessica Lewis,</i>

10:44.018 --> 10:47.730
<i>age 14, who is being held</i>
<i>somewhere here against her will.</i>

10:48.606 --> 10:50.566
She went back to the Visser.

10:50.650 --> 10:55.363
<i>My footage is intended as proof</i>
<i>of crimes committed by Samuel Spare.</i>

10:57.198 --> 10:59.825
<i>Who is guilty of child abuse,</i>

10:59.909 --> 11:01.494
<i>reckless endangerment,</i>

11:01.577 --> 11:03.162
<i>the drugging of a minor,</i>

11:03.871 --> 11:05.498
<i>and probably a lot more.</i>

11:08.459 --> 11:10.086
<i>If something happens to me,</i>

11:10.670 --> 11:12.505
<i>Samuel is responsible.</i>

11:56.507 --> 11:57.341
Jess?

11:58.551 --> 11:59.719
Are you in there?

12:10.563 --> 12:11.480
Jess?

12:15.109 --> 12:16.152
Melody?

12:17.236 --> 12:18.279
Jess?

12:20.573 --> 12:21.741
Open the door.

12:22.658 --> 12:24.952
I can't.
I don't have the key to the deadbolt.

12:25.661 --> 12:26.662
Okay.

12:27.329 --> 12:28.414
Stay right there.

13:00.070 --> 13:00.946
Hey.

13:10.539 --> 13:11.457
Are you okay?

13:11.540 --> 13:12.666
I'm fine.

13:23.010 --> 13:24.303
Are you part of this now?

13:25.054 --> 13:26.263
What?

13:26.347 --> 13:27.223
No.

13:29.141 --> 13:30.017
Fuck.

13:41.278 --> 13:43.364
We'll have to go through the window.

13:43.447 --> 13:44.490
I can't.

13:44.573 --> 13:46.033
Why not?

13:46.116 --> 13:47.117
They need me.

13:47.201 --> 13:50.663
I'm the only one that can hold
a whole new world inside of me.

13:50.746 --> 13:53.624
Whatever they told you,
whatever they promised you,

13:53.707 --> 13:55.000
it's all lies.

13:55.084 --> 13:56.794
You're not safe.

13:58.212 --> 13:59.922
They told me you'd try and stop this.

14:00.714 --> 14:02.216
Jess, we have to go.

14:03.092 --> 14:04.468
I want to help them.

14:05.845 --> 14:07.847
It's my destiny to receive this blessing.

14:07.930 --> 14:11.225
No, it's not.
Do you know what they're gonna do to you?

14:11.934 --> 14:14.436
They'll consecrate the space, and then

14:15.229 --> 14:18.357
-they'll recite a prayer, and then--
-They're going to sacrifice you.

14:18.941 --> 14:20.734
They're going to slit your throat.

14:23.112 --> 14:25.447
-It's not a prayer or a blessing.
-No.

14:25.531 --> 14:28.868
It's a fucked-up occult ritual.

14:28.951 --> 14:31.287
And it's violent and brutal,

14:31.370 --> 14:33.205
and you're going to die.

14:33.289 --> 14:34.456
They wouldn't do that.

14:34.540 --> 14:36.041
Look, I'm sorry.

14:36.125 --> 14:38.168
I am so sorry.

14:38.878 --> 14:40.796
I know you want to help people,

14:40.880 --> 14:42.715
but that's why they chose you.

14:47.970 --> 14:49.138
Where's your mom?

14:52.141 --> 14:53.267
I don't know, they…

14:53.767 --> 14:55.394
They said she'd be waiting for me.

14:55.477 --> 14:56.562
Okay.

14:56.645 --> 14:58.772
We have to get out of here
as fast as we can.

14:59.356 --> 15:00.816
Down the fire escape.

15:00.900 --> 15:02.443
Can you do that with me?

15:05.988 --> 15:07.156
-Yeah.
-Okay.

15:09.116 --> 15:10.534
Hold on, tight.

15:10.618 --> 15:11.619
Jess.

15:15.706 --> 15:19.001
Get to the street as fast as you can
and then you run.

15:19.084 --> 15:20.336
-Okay?
-What about you?

15:20.419 --> 15:22.796
-Jess, what's going on?
-What about you?

15:22.880 --> 15:24.048
I'll be right behind you.

15:24.131 --> 15:27.217
Go to the police station on 8th
and stay there.

15:27.301 --> 15:28.510
-Okay?

15:29.803 --> 15:33.057
Jess, open this door right now.

15:48.781 --> 15:51.075
Where the fuck did you come from?

15:54.370 --> 15:55.621
Where is she?

15:59.708 --> 16:01.210
Where the hell is she?

16:12.471 --> 16:13.639
What did you do?

16:16.558 --> 16:17.768
What the fuck did you do?

16:48.882 --> 16:50.217
You found your way home.

16:51.051 --> 16:52.428
Your vessel is gone.

16:53.053 --> 16:54.596
She's not coming back.

16:55.264 --> 16:56.473
It's all right.

16:57.933 --> 16:59.643
You're the one I really need.

16:59.727 --> 17:01.061
You always were.

17:19.329 --> 17:21.040
I thought that was for Jess.

17:21.123 --> 17:22.124
It was.

17:28.297 --> 17:29.757
Don't take it.

17:30.340 --> 17:32.092
Don't let him do that to you.

18:06.043 --> 18:07.461
Fuck.

18:42.371 --> 18:44.331
Let me the fuck out of here!

19:29.835 --> 19:30.836
Someone!

19:30.919 --> 19:32.254
Help me!

19:32.337 --> 19:34.631
Get the fuck off me!

19:36.175 --> 19:37.176
Help!

19:37.676 --> 19:38.886
Oh, fuck!

19:38.969 --> 19:40.012
Get off me!

19:40.095 --> 19:41.972
Get the fuck off me!

21:24.783 --> 21:26.660
Come forth, Kaelego.

22:19.755 --> 22:21.131
I don't understand.

22:27.929 --> 22:29.097
Melody!

22:31.266 --> 22:32.476
Jess.

22:33.810 --> 22:34.978
Jess, run!

22:35.604 --> 22:36.480
Go!

23:10.138 --> 23:11.681
Holy shit.

23:13.683 --> 23:16.061
Let's break it down. Iris Vos, 1924.

23:16.144 --> 23:19.648
She and her high-society cult
of Kaelego-worshippers execute a ritual.

23:19.731 --> 23:21.400
Ugly shit. Human sacrifice.

23:21.483 --> 23:23.443
Something goes wrong, big explosion,

23:23.527 --> 23:27.072
Vos mansion collapses,
everyone dies, no bodies are found.

23:27.906 --> 23:30.033
Fast-forward to 1994.

23:30.117 --> 23:32.786
Professor Samuel Spare,
or whatever the fuck his name is,

23:32.869 --> 23:35.038
moves into the Visser,
fires up the cult again.

23:35.122 --> 23:37.249
He gathers a ragtag congregation,

23:37.332 --> 23:39.292
collects all the necessary
occult accoutrement,

23:39.376 --> 23:42.754
and he lures Melody,
an unwitting Baldung witch,

23:42.838 --> 23:44.423
into his web.

23:45.674 --> 23:47.634
He tries the ritual again.
What happens?

23:47.717 --> 23:49.469
It's the same fucking disaster.

23:49.553 --> 23:53.682
Except this time, through the miracle
of not-quite-modern technology,

23:53.765 --> 23:54.975
we get a better look.

23:55.642 --> 23:56.935
So how is that possible?

23:57.018 --> 24:01.523
Well, if you believe all the crazy shit
that we've been sifting through,

24:03.150 --> 24:06.403
if you put any stock
in the Baldung mystics

24:06.486 --> 24:08.864
and the Vos Society and the Visser gang,

24:08.947 --> 24:10.866
you'd say we got a glimpse into

24:12.159 --> 24:13.285
Kaelego's hometown.

24:13.368 --> 24:14.578
The Otherworld.

24:14.661 --> 24:17.664
Some kind of shadow dimension
or pocket universe or mirror world.

24:17.747 --> 24:20.083
That spell, that ritual, it, um…

24:20.167 --> 24:22.043
it opens a kind of door.

24:22.127 --> 24:23.545
Or… Or an access point.

24:23.628 --> 24:25.964
A place where two dimensions
briefly intersect.

24:26.047 --> 24:28.884
In 1924, Iris reached into
that other dimension

24:28.967 --> 24:31.011
and tried to pull out
a fistful of Kaelego.

24:31.094 --> 24:32.846
But instead, she got pulled inside.

24:32.929 --> 24:34.389
It's possible.

24:34.473 --> 24:36.349
Melody, she could be stuck there too?

24:36.433 --> 24:37.767
Okay. Yeah, okay.

24:37.851 --> 24:41.563
For the sake of argument, let's say that
Melody got pulled inside by accident.

24:41.646 --> 24:44.608
Let's say that these, um,
these visions you've been having,

24:44.691 --> 24:47.569
these weird conversations
and waking dreams, that…

24:47.652 --> 24:50.197
they're her way of sending
an SOS from the other side.

24:50.280 --> 24:51.531
She's trapped.

24:52.407 --> 24:53.408
I need to get her out.

24:53.492 --> 24:56.036
We have no idea how to do that,
how to get her out.

24:56.119 --> 24:58.705
Well, Davenport clearly
has some kind of plan.

24:59.539 --> 25:02.751
Davenport is a stone-cold motherfucker.

25:03.460 --> 25:07.088
Okay? You're lucky you're not lying in
a shallow grave up at the compound, Dan.

25:07.172 --> 25:09.299
You think he gives
two shits about Melody Pendras?

25:09.382 --> 25:12.594
No. But my father
was trying to help her and he failed.

25:15.180 --> 25:18.308
Maybe everything I lost
all comes back to this moment.

25:19.976 --> 25:22.187
Where I have a chance
to make things right.

25:22.270 --> 25:24.481
Davenport knows how to get to Melody.

25:25.524 --> 25:27.526
I'm gonna convince him to help me.

25:36.326 --> 25:38.703
The terms of our agreement were…

25:40.080 --> 25:41.206
clear, Dan.

25:42.832 --> 25:45.210
LMG has no further obligations to you.

25:45.293 --> 25:46.920
I'm sorry you came all this way.

25:47.712 --> 25:48.964
There's another tape.

25:55.679 --> 25:57.931
That's not possible. I have them all.

25:58.014 --> 25:58.932
No, you don't.

25:59.558 --> 26:02.602
Something else was left behind
the night of the fire.

26:03.895 --> 26:05.480
The end of the story.

26:05.564 --> 26:07.399
The end of Samuel's story.

26:21.037 --> 26:22.038
Leave it.

26:48.398 --> 26:49.733
Is there more?

26:50.525 --> 26:52.569
I have some questions first.

26:58.742 --> 27:01.369
You knew what was on those tapes
before I ever touched them.

27:03.204 --> 27:04.080
No.

27:04.164 --> 27:05.540
That's not true.

27:05.624 --> 27:07.709
You revealed their contents to me.

27:08.543 --> 27:11.963
But you knew Melody was shooting footage
of your brother at the Visser.

27:12.505 --> 27:13.423
Of his cult.

27:13.506 --> 27:16.551
You believed something
was on those tapes, or in them.

27:17.135 --> 27:19.262
Sounds like you might believe that too.

27:19.846 --> 27:23.892
You knew Samuel was hunting
for that Vos Society snuff film.

27:25.977 --> 27:28.521
He believed it had
some kind of power in it.

27:29.105 --> 27:30.607
Some kind of magic.

27:30.690 --> 27:34.361
He believed it could crack open a door
between this world and another one.

27:42.994 --> 27:44.704
He told me all about it.

27:47.165 --> 27:48.833
That night outside the Visser.

27:48.917 --> 27:51.086
I thought he was crazy at the time.

27:53.254 --> 27:55.173
You ever think about what it means?

27:55.757 --> 27:59.344
To capture a moment in time
on a piece of film?

28:01.179 --> 28:04.724
To give it an eternity
it was never meant to have?

28:05.767 --> 28:09.688
What else might we be scooping up
in that moment?

28:10.313 --> 28:12.023
What can't we see?

28:12.107 --> 28:14.109
What the fuck is on those tapes?

28:14.776 --> 28:15.902
They're a window.

28:17.070 --> 28:19.155
A glimpse into another world.

28:19.239 --> 28:21.783
Why did you wait 25 years
to see what was in them?

28:21.866 --> 28:24.077
I didn't have the tapes, Dan.

28:24.869 --> 28:28.540
By the time I went looking for them,
they were long gone.

28:28.623 --> 28:30.709
It was pure luck
that they came up for auction

28:30.792 --> 28:34.963
at a storage facility
in New Jersey last year.

28:35.964 --> 28:39.384
Wait, how…
how did they end up at a storage facility?

28:39.968 --> 28:41.469
Your father put them there.

28:41.553 --> 28:43.930
I don't know why
he went back for those tapes.

28:44.013 --> 28:46.391
Maybe he thought
they were worth something.

28:46.474 --> 28:48.810
Maybe he thought they were dangerous.

28:48.893 --> 28:51.730
In any case, it was a terrible mistake.

28:52.814 --> 28:55.984
They burned down your house
in order to destroy them.

28:58.236 --> 28:59.738
Who burned down my house?

29:01.531 --> 29:05.326
There are people who will risk everything

29:05.410 --> 29:07.871
to raise that godforsaken demon
into this world.

29:07.954 --> 29:10.874
And there are people
who will risk everything

29:11.541 --> 29:14.043
to keep such an event from ever happening.

29:14.586 --> 29:18.548
Your father was on
the receiving end of that ideology.

29:18.631 --> 29:20.508
Your family paid the price.

29:20.592 --> 29:22.844
Your escape was entirely accidental.

29:26.931 --> 29:28.725
Have I answered all your questions now?

29:29.559 --> 29:31.186
Can I see the rest of the footage?

29:32.270 --> 29:34.063
Melody Pendras is still alive.

29:34.689 --> 29:36.483
She's stuck in the Otherworld.

29:37.817 --> 29:39.736
I need your help to get her out.

29:39.819 --> 29:41.362
That's not possible.

29:41.446 --> 29:43.031
The fuck it isn't.

29:43.114 --> 29:47.827
No, I mean, it's not a hospitable
environment for a human being.

29:48.453 --> 29:50.955
The mechanics of that universe
are entirely different.

29:51.831 --> 29:54.959
Time and space
do not operate in the same way.

29:55.043 --> 29:57.504
No one can survive in there
for any length of time.

29:57.587 --> 29:58.963
I don't know what to tell you.

29:59.047 --> 30:00.924
She's in there, I need to get her out.

30:01.007 --> 30:03.426
I've spent the better part of 20 years

30:03.510 --> 30:06.221
researching the properties
of this dimension,

30:06.304 --> 30:10.141
formulating a strategy
to access its powers.

30:10.225 --> 30:11.935
Your brother's in there too.

30:28.034 --> 30:29.577
We can save them both.

30:37.752 --> 30:39.546
My brother was an irrational…

30:42.257 --> 30:44.759
unstable egomaniac.

30:44.843 --> 30:47.929
I see no reason to free him from the tomb

30:48.012 --> 30:50.390
he so willingly trapped himself in.

30:53.893 --> 30:56.229
I'm sorry, was that your ace in the hole?

31:01.568 --> 31:02.610
Ah!

31:14.998 --> 31:16.207
I'm sorry, Dan.

31:17.750 --> 31:19.168
I really do like you.

31:29.012 --> 31:31.931
Three years of stage combat training,
finally useful.

31:37.353 --> 31:38.605
Dan, where you going?

31:45.445 --> 31:46.905
Dude, hey, what the…

31:47.405 --> 31:49.240
Where the fuck are you going?

31:51.701 --> 31:52.660
What the fuck?

31:53.786 --> 31:55.788
He's not dead,
so we need to get out of here

31:55.872 --> 31:58.458
before he wakes up
and sends in his Blackwater hit squad.

32:01.294 --> 32:03.838
-I have to go through with this.
-Go through with what?

32:03.922 --> 32:05.590
-I came here to get Melody out.
-No.

32:05.673 --> 32:07.675
You came to convince Dr. Evil
to get her out.

32:07.759 --> 32:10.720
You played the game, gave it your best,
came up short. It happens.

32:10.803 --> 32:12.388
Everything we need is here.

32:16.559 --> 32:17.393
Dan.

32:21.064 --> 32:22.774
Dan, fucking stop!

32:23.858 --> 32:25.735
I know what I'm doing. Okay?

32:25.818 --> 32:28.655
I know that ground was consecrated
or whatever the fuck you wanna call it

32:28.738 --> 32:31.115
because I did that
by restoring and digitizing those tapes.

32:31.199 --> 32:33.952
I know that room
has synthetic Kharonite panels

32:34.035 --> 32:36.663
that Davenport must be using
to replace a dying comet.

32:36.746 --> 32:39.999
We have the book, we have…
we have the totem. Right?

32:41.459 --> 32:43.169
We saw ritual footage
from both time periods,

32:43.252 --> 32:44.712
we know how the spell's supposed to go.

32:44.796 --> 32:48.841
Again, though, they both ended
in total fucking destruction, okay?

32:48.925 --> 32:51.719
If you think I'm gonna let you slit
my throat in pursuit of your girlfriend,

32:51.803 --> 32:54.013
we need to have a serious discussion
about our friendship.

32:54.097 --> 32:57.934
I'm not trying to raise a demon.
I'm just trying to open up a door.

32:58.017 --> 32:59.519
I'm not gonna let you do this, okay?

32:59.602 --> 33:02.146
I'm not gonna let you
fucking commit suicide.

33:02.230 --> 33:03.856
Okay, you should just go.

33:05.191 --> 33:06.567
The fuck you talking about?

33:06.651 --> 33:08.778
You should go.
I mean, you're right. It's not safe.

33:08.861 --> 33:10.321
I don't want you to get hurt.

33:10.405 --> 33:12.949
Either way, gonna have
a great fucking story for your podcast.

33:15.827 --> 33:16.828
Are you fucking serious?

33:16.911 --> 33:18.705
Think I've been
doing this all for a story?

33:22.500 --> 33:23.876
I care about you, Dan.

33:24.585 --> 33:25.545
Fuck.

33:26.337 --> 33:29.048
I don't give a fuck about the podcast.

33:30.758 --> 33:31.759
Okay.

33:32.844 --> 33:34.679
I don't want you to die, man.

33:37.598 --> 33:39.684
But if you're really gonna do this…

33:42.812 --> 33:44.522
I'm not gonna leave you here.

33:46.065 --> 33:47.859
And fuck you for thinking that I would.

33:58.745 --> 34:00.288
Okay, let's get to it.

34:19.682 --> 34:21.476
<i>I brought you a care package.</i>

34:22.060 --> 34:23.895
<i>Snacks, pictures…</i>

34:26.981 --> 34:29.108
<i>Why'd you give</i>
<i>Dr. Turner my number?</i>

34:29.609 --> 34:31.027
<i>Because he asked for it.</i>

34:36.407 --> 34:37.533
<i> Who's there?</i>

34:41.412 --> 34:43.289
<i>Hey, I'm joking.</i>
<i>It's just a joke.</i>

34:43.831 --> 34:45.833
<i>-Don't be mad.</i>
-<i> I fucking hate you.</i>

34:45.917 --> 34:47.627
<i>I brought you a care package.</i>

34:48.377 --> 34:50.630
<i>Snacks, pictures, and…</i>

34:50.713 --> 34:52.757
Holy fuck.

34:53.257 --> 34:55.384
<i>Why'd you give</i>
<i>Dr. Turner my number?</i>

34:55.885 --> 34:57.512
<i>Because he asked for it.</i>

34:58.262 --> 35:00.389
You know, this is not a criticism, but…

35:01.015 --> 35:04.644
you did not prepare me
for how fucking weird this place is.

35:11.234 --> 35:13.027
I hope you're in there, Melody.

35:14.362 --> 35:15.404
<i> Who's there?</i>

35:16.781 --> 35:17.698
Dan.

35:22.495 --> 35:23.996
Hell of a goddamn blow.

35:24.705 --> 35:26.040
Not sure he'll make it.

35:28.459 --> 35:31.295
It was just self-defense.
I just wanted to talk to him--

35:31.379 --> 35:34.590
You didn't want to talk.
You wanted to hijack this thing.

35:35.174 --> 35:36.843
I… To help someone.

35:36.926 --> 35:38.469
The girl on the tapes.

35:39.220 --> 35:40.763
Yes. Melody.

35:41.305 --> 35:43.641
-We think she's trapped.
-In the Otherworld.

35:45.101 --> 35:45.977
Right.

35:46.519 --> 35:49.188
Why would you risk your life
for someone you don't even know?

35:49.272 --> 35:50.523
I do know her.

35:50.606 --> 35:52.733
You know a shadow.

35:52.817 --> 35:54.819
No, no, it's not like that.

35:56.696 --> 35:59.240
We found each other somehow.
She's counting on me.

35:59.323 --> 36:01.951
It didn't work for them,
it won't work for you.

36:02.034 --> 36:05.997
They thought they had everything
they needed. They were wrong.

36:18.092 --> 36:20.761
That book should have been destroyed.

36:21.304 --> 36:24.724
The Vos family stole something
that didn't belong to them.

36:24.807 --> 36:27.476
But they failed to acquire this.

36:29.478 --> 36:30.438
A key.

36:32.106 --> 36:33.149
Holy shit.

36:34.817 --> 36:37.028
Holy shit, Dan. She's a Baldung.

36:37.904 --> 36:40.615
Only a Baldung can open the door

36:40.698 --> 36:45.244
with both the spell <i>and</i> the key.

36:46.204 --> 36:48.706
You were the one who
was gonna get Davenport inside?

36:48.789 --> 36:50.082
No, never.

36:50.666 --> 36:52.335
He was a means to an end.

36:54.587 --> 36:56.464
Okay. So, just…

36:57.173 --> 36:58.674
spitballing here. Um…

37:01.177 --> 37:03.137
You're going rogue, raising up the demon?

37:03.221 --> 37:05.806
'Cause I thought we read
that the Baldungs were the ones

37:05.890 --> 37:09.602
that gave up their magic
to lock Kaelego away?

37:11.312 --> 37:12.939
That's not what she's here for.

37:16.025 --> 37:17.693
You wanna get her out too.

37:23.783 --> 37:24.909
You're her mother.

37:32.792 --> 37:35.920
I thought if I gave her up, she'd be safe.

37:39.840 --> 37:43.261
She wouldn't have to bear
the burden of this bloodline.

37:46.472 --> 37:47.765
I had no idea

37:48.975 --> 37:50.768
she'd come looking for me.

37:53.145 --> 37:54.689
And then she was gone.

37:56.357 --> 37:58.609
I have spent 25 years

37:58.693 --> 38:02.154
trying to find a way to get her back.

38:04.532 --> 38:06.701
How did you know she was in there?

38:09.412 --> 38:10.997
I dream about her.

38:14.667 --> 38:16.085
Every night.

38:19.797 --> 38:21.090
But like you said,

38:22.425 --> 38:24.051
I don't have magic anymore.

38:25.094 --> 38:27.596
So, I needed Davenport
to make this possible.

38:27.680 --> 38:31.142
Someone to thin the veil enough
to crack inside.

38:31.225 --> 38:34.270
That's what playing the footage does.

38:36.230 --> 38:40.276
It unravels the spell
that holds the door shut.

38:50.119 --> 38:51.787
Then what are we waiting for?

38:55.291 --> 38:57.877
Every world has its own frequency.

38:57.960 --> 39:01.547
Finding the right one
is the only way to open the door.

39:02.173 --> 39:05.468
Davenport said it was impossible
for a human to survive in there.

39:06.260 --> 39:09.847
With all due respect to that motherfucker,
he doesn't know what he's talking about.

39:09.930 --> 39:12.475
It <i>will</i> be disorienting.

39:12.558 --> 39:14.852
Time doesn't move in the same way.

39:14.935 --> 39:17.521
And he'll want to keep you there. Kaelego.

39:18.314 --> 39:19.523
He's desperate.

39:20.274 --> 39:21.233
Lonely.

39:22.735 --> 39:24.278
He'll want you to stay.

39:24.362 --> 39:26.822
He'll try to trick you into surrendering.

39:26.906 --> 39:29.450
Wait, what does that mean exactly?

39:29.533 --> 39:30.659
Five minutes.

39:30.743 --> 39:32.703
That's how long I can hold it open.

39:50.388 --> 39:51.764
This is your way back.

39:52.598 --> 39:55.267
Follow this sound home, understand?

42:25.626 --> 42:26.794
Hey.

42:28.170 --> 42:29.046
Hey.

42:40.015 --> 42:40.975
A-minor.

42:50.025 --> 42:50.985
Don't.

42:52.403 --> 42:53.612
Why?

42:56.490 --> 42:57.950
What are you playing?

42:59.285 --> 43:00.327
I don't know.

43:01.495 --> 43:02.538
I like it.

43:04.957 --> 43:07.001
Danny, how was your day?

43:08.752 --> 43:09.670
Fine.

43:09.753 --> 43:12.006
We still on for
<i>Clash of the Titans</i> tonight?

43:15.718 --> 43:16.552
Okay.

43:17.177 --> 43:18.304
Dinner's ready.

43:23.392 --> 43:25.060
Come on, Danny. It'll get cold.

43:47.207 --> 43:48.417
So how was your walk?

43:48.959 --> 43:50.002
<i>Did it rain?</i>

43:53.881 --> 43:55.174
What about the fire?

43:55.716 --> 43:56.717
What fire?

43:59.887 --> 44:01.055
<i>The house.</i>

44:03.390 --> 44:04.892
There was a fire.

44:04.975 --> 44:06.435
There was no fire.

44:11.857 --> 44:12.941
You're here.

44:13.859 --> 44:15.027
And you're safe.

44:15.736 --> 44:16.570
Hmm.

44:18.238 --> 44:19.531
We're all safe.

44:47.810 --> 44:50.354
<i>Please. Please find me.</i>

44:53.190 --> 44:54.358
I have to go.

44:57.236 --> 44:58.696
We can start again.

45:00.572 --> 45:03.534
All right? Have the life
you were supposed to have.

45:06.870 --> 45:09.498
All right? Have the life
you were supposed to have.

45:35.774 --> 45:36.734
Melody?

45:46.201 --> 45:47.202
Melody?

46:12.478 --> 46:13.479
Melody?

46:40.756 --> 46:41.715
Dan?

46:43.050 --> 46:44.134
Hi.

46:44.218 --> 46:45.594
Come with me.

46:45.677 --> 46:46.678
I can't.

46:47.554 --> 46:48.555
I'm waiting.

46:49.431 --> 46:50.599
She'll be here.

46:50.682 --> 46:52.476
No. No, it's a trick.

46:54.978 --> 46:56.396
I don't think so.

46:58.524 --> 47:00.108
You have to trust me, Melody.

47:00.818 --> 47:02.152
You came here for me?

47:04.446 --> 47:05.989
I thought you were a dream.

47:06.907 --> 47:07.908
Same.

47:37.187 --> 47:38.522
Okay, we have to go.

47:59.668 --> 48:00.919
Wait a minute.

48:01.545 --> 48:04.423
No, this isn't right.
We're supposed to be in the compound.

48:50.302 --> 48:51.261
Hello?

48:55.682 --> 48:56.767
Hello?

49:29.383 --> 49:31.885
No!

50:33.238 --> 50:36.158
Dan? Dan?

51:03.894 --> 51:05.520
Do I know you?

51:09.149 --> 51:10.358
Where's Dan?

51:16.198 --> 51:17.240
I don't know.

51:17.908 --> 51:19.951
He was right next to me. He…

51:20.035 --> 51:21.119
He…

51:23.080 --> 51:24.122
Samuel.

51:25.665 --> 51:27.167
Samuel was there.

51:28.126 --> 51:29.211
Dan?

51:30.212 --> 51:31.129
Dan?

51:32.047 --> 51:33.090
Dan!

51:44.935 --> 51:45.852
Hello?

51:48.146 --> 51:49.106
Hello?

51:50.941 --> 51:52.984
Hello? Is anybody out there?

51:54.319 --> 51:55.529
Well, hello there.

51:57.823 --> 52:00.033
We were worried
you were never gonna wake up.

52:02.494 --> 52:03.870
How long have I been…?

52:05.163 --> 52:07.415
Uh… ten days.

52:08.333 --> 52:09.251
Days.

52:09.918 --> 52:12.170
Have my friends been here? Mark?

52:12.796 --> 52:14.381
No, sorry.

52:14.464 --> 52:15.715
No visitors.

52:21.721 --> 52:23.306
How did I get here?

52:23.390 --> 52:27.185
Well, all I know is that
you were luckier than the rest.

52:27.727 --> 52:29.437
God was watching out for you.

52:30.689 --> 52:31.731
The rest?

52:31.815 --> 52:33.191
Did you live there?

52:33.275 --> 52:35.443
Were you close to your neighbors?

52:35.527 --> 52:36.736
Live where?

52:38.071 --> 52:39.364
The Visser.

52:41.032 --> 52:42.284
The Visser?

52:42.367 --> 52:45.036
So tragic. All those people.

52:47.622 --> 52:48.623
I'm sorry.

52:51.543 --> 52:52.711
What year is it?

52:54.337 --> 52:57.382
I'm gonna go get the doc
and have him come in, talk to you.

52:57.966 --> 52:59.009
What year?

52:59.092 --> 53:00.427
I'll be right back.
