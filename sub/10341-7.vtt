WEBVTT

01:38.014 --> 01:40.557
Everything's set. They're waiting for us
at the Great Northern.

01:40.725 --> 01:47.314
Yeah, a large house made of wood,
surrounded by trees.

01:47.482 --> 01:52.027
The house is filled with many rooms
each alike,

01:52.195 --> 01:58.492
but occupied by different souls
night after night.

01:59.911 --> 02:04.206
- The guests will be in the lobby?
- Full cooperation.

02:04.415 --> 02:08.085
Hawk, you got that warrant
for Harold Smith's apartment?

02:08.294 --> 02:11.088
On my way
as soon as I finish my coffee.

02:11.297 --> 02:14.049
Hawk,
Gordon has mentioned pages...

02:14.259 --> 02:17.302
What I mentioned were pages
found near the bloody towel

02:17.470 --> 02:19.555
down the train tracks
from the crime site

02:19.722 --> 02:22.057
were from a diary.

02:22.267 --> 02:24.226
Donna Hayward
spoke of Harold Smith

02:24.394 --> 02:26.979
having a secret diary
of Laura Palmer's.

02:27.188 --> 02:30.732
Could be important.
Let me know what you dig up.

02:31.985 --> 02:33.193
Gordon, I understand you're...?

02:33.361 --> 02:35.612
Gordon, I understand
you're on your way to Bend, Oregon?

02:35.780 --> 02:40.409
I'm over to Bend, Oregon,
official business, real hush-hush.

02:40.618 --> 02:42.870
Good luck to all of you.

02:47.333 --> 02:49.376
- Coop.
- Gordon.

02:51.045 --> 02:53.255
Take good care of Mike.

02:54.382 --> 02:57.467
It was real nice meeting you fellas.

02:58.011 --> 02:59.761
- Sheriff.
- Safe journey, chief.

02:59.929 --> 03:01.471
Thanks.

03:17.113 --> 03:18.864
No.

03:20.491 --> 03:29.124
No.

03:47.393 --> 04:09.373
No.

04:13.795 --> 04:16.463
Sheriff? Sheriff!

04:16.631 --> 04:21.426
Sheriff, what's the meaning of this?
What the hell is going on here?

04:25.431 --> 04:29.685
Will somebody please tell me
what the hell is happening here?

04:32.522 --> 04:35.232
What in the hell is going on?

04:58.881 --> 05:00.841
Mr. Smith.

05:02.135 --> 05:04.219
Harold Smith?

05:42.967 --> 05:44.343
Morning.

05:46.637 --> 05:49.681
- Good morning, dear.
- Good morning, Maddy.

06:20.755 --> 06:22.672
Uncle Leland.

06:23.466 --> 06:25.425
Aunt Sarah.

06:26.552 --> 06:31.556
Sit. Oh, good, you got some coffee.
Good.

06:31.724 --> 06:36.728
- Did you sleep well?
- Very well. Thanks.

06:40.233 --> 06:42.317
I've been thinking.

06:42.819 --> 06:45.654
I've really enjoyed my stay
and everything.

06:45.822 --> 06:47.239
Aw.

06:48.241 --> 06:53.370
But I really feel like it's time
for me to go home now.

06:57.417 --> 06:58.750
To Missoula.

06:58.960 --> 07:03.130
I've got my job and my apartment.

07:03.339 --> 07:05.340
And I just...

07:07.176 --> 07:10.262
- ...miss having a life of my own.
Uh-huh.

07:12.348 --> 07:17.644
So I think I'll probably be driving
back home tomorrow.

07:17.812 --> 07:18.854
Tomorrow?

07:19.021 --> 07:23.942
Well, we are going to miss you
very much.

07:24.986 --> 07:28.029
- But we also understand completely.
- You do?

07:28.239 --> 07:31.074
- We do.
- We do. Yes, we do.

07:34.620 --> 07:37.956
You have been
such a wonderful help.

07:38.166 --> 07:41.710
Yes, but now she has to think
about herself, honey.

07:41.878 --> 07:44.004
She's got her own life.

07:44.589 --> 07:46.840
Besides, you'll come back and visit,
won't you?

07:47.008 --> 07:49.009
Oh, of course.

07:49.177 --> 07:52.512
- I'll come galloping back often.
- Heh, heh, heh.

07:52.680 --> 07:55.557
It's not like Missoula
was at the far end of the universe.

07:55.725 --> 07:57.184
- No.
- Hardly.

07:57.351 --> 07:59.436
Well, good then.

07:59.645 --> 08:01.563
It's all right.

08:04.567 --> 08:07.819
Just know that we love you
very much.

08:09.363 --> 08:11.615
I love you too.

08:32.470 --> 08:35.388
- Hey, what's that, a note?
- Yeah.

08:45.691 --> 08:48.068
"I'm a lonely soul."

08:48.736 --> 08:50.487
Poor guy.

08:51.989 --> 08:53.782
It's a good thing
Andy didn't see this one.

08:53.950 --> 08:54.991
Oh, yeah.

08:59.330 --> 09:01.540
Take a look at this.

09:10.049 --> 09:12.926
"This is the diary of Laura Palmer."

09:14.136 --> 09:15.971
Pay dirt.

09:36.784 --> 09:42.581
Well, we have bills here
that total $1,014.

09:42.748 --> 09:45.584
Including the insurance money

09:45.751 --> 09:47.711
that leaves you with...

09:50.006 --> 09:52.299
Forty-two dollars.

09:53.384 --> 09:57.053
- Forty-two dollars.
- That's a good start.

09:57.805 --> 10:00.515
Forty-two dollars for the month?

10:01.475 --> 10:02.851
How am I gonna make it?

10:03.060 --> 10:05.854
How are we supposed to survive
on $42 a month?

10:06.564 --> 10:09.733
We? Shelly, I can't keep telling
my mom and dad

10:09.900 --> 10:11.860
that I'm spending the night
at Mike's.

10:12.069 --> 10:14.154
What time is it?
I'm missing Economics as it is.

10:14.363 --> 10:17.449
"We" meant me and Leo.

10:17.742 --> 10:20.577
Bobby, you said
you were gonna take care of us.

10:21.329 --> 10:23.913
I am, Shelly. I am.

10:25.666 --> 10:28.251
I want you
to take the necklace back.

10:30.755 --> 10:33.465
We don't have to do that.

10:35.468 --> 10:38.595
I want you to take the necklace back.
We need the money.

10:38.804 --> 10:41.806
Shelly, you're gonna
keep this necklace.

10:42.558 --> 10:45.101
When am I ever gonna feel
glamorous enough to wear it?

10:45.311 --> 10:48.938
Giving Leo a bath?
Feeding him his oatmeal?

10:52.485 --> 10:54.361
What about his truck?

10:54.528 --> 10:57.072
He's not gonna be cannonballing
down the highway anytime soon.

10:57.239 --> 11:00.867
- The police impounded it.
- We can get it back.

11:01.077 --> 11:03.244
They said if it was used
in the commission of a crime

11:03.412 --> 11:05.997
it becomes property of the state.

11:06.248 --> 11:10.168
- He wasn't charged with anything.
- I didn't make the rules.

11:10.336 --> 11:12.170
Okay, okay.

11:12.338 --> 11:14.005
It's like you're blaming me
for something.

11:14.173 --> 11:18.218
I'm not blaming you. Come on.
Take it easy.

11:19.887 --> 11:24.015
Leo was into a lot of different stuff
with a lot of different people.

11:25.559 --> 11:27.435
He was in it for the money.

11:27.645 --> 11:31.606
Bobby, look around you.
You really think that Leo had money?

11:32.358 --> 11:34.901
Yes, I do.
Having a look at this checkbook,

11:35.069 --> 11:38.113
I don't think he ever stepped foot
into a bank.

11:38.322 --> 11:40.031
He must have been hiding it
somewhere.

11:46.163 --> 11:47.664
He's alive.

11:49.542 --> 11:51.459
New shoes.

11:53.337 --> 11:55.588
Bobby, he's alive.

12:13.691 --> 12:17.902
- He ain't alive, Shelly.
- But he talked.

12:18.112 --> 12:21.156
It's only... That was a burp.
He probably has gas.

12:22.408 --> 12:24.159
You call that a burp?

12:25.870 --> 12:27.829
New shoes.

12:33.294 --> 12:37.088
Did he buy any shoes lately
by any chance?

12:37.965 --> 12:39.632
No.

12:40.968 --> 12:43.011
He had me take in a pair of boots
for repair.

12:43.929 --> 12:46.639
- When?
- Last week.

12:47.516 --> 12:50.185
- Have you got a receipt?
- Yeah, why?

12:50.394 --> 12:53.354
I don't know.
Shelly, go get that receipt.

12:58.235 --> 13:00.403
New shoes.

13:02.448 --> 13:04.741
Want some new shoes, Leo?

13:05.493 --> 13:08.703
Give us what we want,
I'll buy you the whole damn shoe store.

13:15.711 --> 13:17.545
New shoes.

13:22.301 --> 13:26.012
Daddy, I know about
One-Eyed Jack's.

13:28.891 --> 13:32.602
I'm sure I don't know
what you're talking about.

13:32.770 --> 13:35.855
I know about Blackie,
I know about Emory Battis,

13:36.065 --> 13:39.692
I know about Ronette,
and I know about Laura.

13:43.364 --> 13:45.657
Okay.

13:45.825 --> 13:48.701
I was there. I saw you.

13:50.621 --> 13:52.247
Uh-huh.

13:53.040 --> 13:55.416
You remember Prudence?

13:56.126 --> 13:58.920
I wore a little white mask.

14:08.889 --> 14:11.850
I need to ask you some questions.

14:13.477 --> 14:15.395
Ask away.

14:16.230 --> 14:19.440
How long have you owned
One-Eyed Jack's?

14:23.237 --> 14:25.655
Five years.

14:27.616 --> 14:30.493
Did you know Laura worked there?

14:30.661 --> 14:32.996
She was only there for a brief time.

14:33.205 --> 14:35.331
- Did you know?
- Yes.

14:36.083 --> 14:38.293
Did you in any way encourage her
to work there?

14:38.460 --> 14:42.255
No. I had no idea.

14:42.756 --> 14:45.049
She asked if she could work
in the department store.

14:45.217 --> 14:47.844
Battis sent her without my knowing.

14:51.765 --> 14:53.975
Did you sleep with her?

15:05.529 --> 15:07.238
Did you?

15:15.247 --> 15:16.998
Yes.

15:29.136 --> 15:31.220
Did you kill her?

15:43.400 --> 15:44.692
I loved her.

16:10.302 --> 16:13.805
Norma, can I talk to you
for a second?

16:14.473 --> 16:17.350
Sure. What's up?

16:17.643 --> 16:19.143
Um...

16:20.396 --> 16:23.314
With Leo coming home and all...

16:23.899 --> 16:26.651
...I'm supposed to be there
to watch him.

16:27.820 --> 16:31.072
And it looks like
it's gonna be a full-time thing.

16:33.575 --> 16:38.079
So I was thinking

16:38.247 --> 16:40.915
that I have to quit my job.

16:42.543 --> 16:45.378
Just for a little while anyway.

16:46.755 --> 16:48.589
I'm sorry.

16:50.467 --> 16:53.720
I promised myself
I wasn't gonna do this.

16:57.641 --> 16:59.851
It's all right, sweetheart.

17:02.229 --> 17:04.731
I just feel so bad.

17:06.275 --> 17:10.611
I love you. I love working here.

17:11.488 --> 17:14.032
I don't wanna let you down.

17:15.409 --> 17:17.827
You're not gonna let me down.

17:19.621 --> 17:21.039
I'm not?

17:22.332 --> 17:26.878
Look, Shelly, you've got your own life
to worry about.

17:27.337 --> 17:29.213
I'll be fine here.

17:29.381 --> 17:33.217
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

17:34.011 --> 17:36.888
Now, you look after yourself.

17:37.264 --> 17:39.640
When you're ready,
you can come right back.

17:39.850 --> 17:43.019
It'll be like you haven't even
missed a day.

17:44.938 --> 17:47.607
You'll let me come back?

17:47.775 --> 17:51.402
You just try to take a job someplace
else and see what happens.

17:57.117 --> 17:59.368
I don't know what to say.

18:01.997 --> 18:04.332
Don't say anything.

18:18.263 --> 18:20.681
And I told him I'd been traveling
with my parents,

18:20.891 --> 18:24.268
but now I wanted to register
for spring semester.

18:24.436 --> 18:27.271
Oh, Eddie, let's sit at the counter.

18:27.481 --> 18:31.234
I'm just dying for a chocolate shake,
aren't you?

18:31.652 --> 18:34.153
Hi, Norma.

18:34.321 --> 18:38.783
Say, how long have you
been working here?

18:39.827 --> 18:42.120
Well, it's 20 years this April.

18:45.165 --> 18:48.000
Oh, you kidder.

18:48.168 --> 18:49.919
What a kidder. Heh, heh, heh.

18:50.671 --> 18:55.383
Well, it's been about, uh, six weeks,
isn't that right, Norma?

18:55.551 --> 18:58.719
- Huh?
- About six weeks.

18:59.429 --> 19:04.016
- Oh, yeah, that's right.
- Well, you see?

19:04.726 --> 19:08.062
When your parents drag you off
to Europe or someplace for a month,

19:08.230 --> 19:12.525
then when you get back,
it's like you've been away forever.

19:15.362 --> 19:17.822
Two chocolate shakes,
please, Norma.

19:18.699 --> 19:22.994
- Coffee for me.
- Extra whipped cream on mine.

19:23.162 --> 19:24.495
Hi.

19:25.497 --> 19:29.792
- What's your name?
- Shelly.

19:30.836 --> 19:34.005
Are you in our class at school?

19:35.591 --> 19:37.800
I don't think so.

19:38.719 --> 19:40.178
Oh.

19:43.015 --> 19:45.433
I'll get the shake and coffee.

19:50.564 --> 19:53.983
- Europe?
- Yeah.

19:54.484 --> 19:56.777
My parents loved it so much
they're still there.

19:56.945 --> 19:59.030
Can you believe it?

19:59.239 --> 20:03.910
And they said it was okay
for me to stay over at Eddie's.

20:04.578 --> 20:07.997
Is it your parents' house
or mine, Eddie?

20:08.165 --> 20:09.582
That's right.

20:11.668 --> 20:16.005
Oh, say, Norma,
you're not mad or anything

20:16.215 --> 20:21.260
because Eddie's sort of taking me out,
are you?

20:21.428 --> 20:25.765
You and Ed? No. No.
Why should I be?

20:25.974 --> 20:29.810
Oh, no reason.
Eddie told me you broke up.

20:31.855 --> 20:33.564
It's just that...

20:34.149 --> 20:37.485
...I'm just so sweet on him.

20:41.448 --> 20:45.910
- Isn't he just the dreamiest?
- Nadine.

20:47.120 --> 20:51.290
I can't wait
for the start of football season.

20:51.458 --> 20:55.753
- Can you?
- No. Can't wait.

20:55.963 --> 20:57.922
Me neither.

20:58.131 --> 21:01.384
I am just so happy.

21:02.386 --> 21:04.637
- Oh, Nadine.
- Oh, God, I'm sorry.

21:04.805 --> 21:08.224
- How'd you do that?
- There goes another one.

21:09.559 --> 21:12.061
There must've been a crack
in this glass from before.

21:12.229 --> 21:14.772
- Golly.
- Don't count on it.

21:14.982 --> 21:17.775
I'm so clumsy lately.

21:17.943 --> 21:21.362
I can hardly believe it.

21:21.530 --> 21:24.323
Shelly, get those Band-Aids,
and I'll get a towel.

21:28.287 --> 21:31.122
Oh, Eddie.

21:32.374 --> 21:35.835
I am so happy

21:36.044 --> 21:42.049
I could just kiss you to death.

21:57.858 --> 22:00.401
Oh, boy, Nadine.

22:14.541 --> 22:17.710
I think she's at the diner. Shelly.

22:19.171 --> 22:20.838
Shelly.

22:25.218 --> 22:29.764
There he is, Mike.
The late Leo Johnson.

22:42.569 --> 22:45.071
- Hank did this?
- He sure as hell did.

22:45.238 --> 22:48.032
He shot him through that window
right there.

22:50.035 --> 22:53.454
Leo, I went to the shoe shop.

22:54.581 --> 22:58.000
I showed them the ticket,
and look what they gave me.

22:59.795 --> 23:04.673
- New shoes.
- No, you knucklehead, old shoes.

23:04.883 --> 23:07.426
Leo, he gets pretty fixated.

23:07.636 --> 23:10.513
I hope he gets permanently fixated.

23:11.431 --> 23:14.225
I know you too damn well, Leo.

23:14.434 --> 23:18.813
Something about these shoes,
isn't there? Huh?

23:19.022 --> 23:21.607
There's something
with these shoes.

23:26.029 --> 23:29.615
I heard about people, you know,
muling stuff in their boot.

23:29.825 --> 23:31.867
What, do you think
I didn't check these out?

23:32.035 --> 23:33.994
Would you get a hammer?

23:35.664 --> 23:37.706
Don't go anywhere, Leo.

23:55.809 --> 23:57.518
Oh, my God.

24:09.990 --> 24:12.241
- What is that, a tape?
- Don't.

24:14.327 --> 24:16.620
Quit spitting, man.

24:19.916 --> 24:22.042
Well, it's not money.

24:24.254 --> 24:26.422
But who knows?

24:42.063 --> 24:44.648
Diane, it's 2:47 p.m.

24:44.858 --> 24:47.026
I'm in the conference room
at the sheriff's station

24:47.194 --> 24:50.070
with the remains
of Laura Palmer's secret diary.

24:50.280 --> 24:52.448
A great deal of it
has been mutilated.

24:52.657 --> 24:54.325
Much of what I've been able
to decipher

24:54.493 --> 24:56.827
supports the contention
of the one-armed man.

24:57.037 --> 25:00.206
There are repeated references
to a Bob.

25:00.415 --> 25:03.334
He was a threatening presence
in her life from early adolescence.

25:03.543 --> 25:09.215
There are intimations of abuse
and molestation on a regular basis.

25:09.424 --> 25:13.260
He is referred to,
on more than one occasion,

25:13.470 --> 25:15.930
as a friend of her father's.

25:16.139 --> 25:17.681
And I just uncovered this entry

25:17.849 --> 25:20.643
dated less than two weeks
before her death:

25:21.186 --> 25:25.397
"Someday I'm gonna tell the world
about Ben Horne.

25:25.607 --> 25:28.984
I'm gonna tell them
who Ben Horne really is."

25:31.947 --> 25:32.988
Yes?

25:36.785 --> 25:38.744
- Audrey.
- I had to see you.

25:38.954 --> 25:42.081
- I'm sorry if I'm interrupting you.
- How are you feeling?

25:42.290 --> 25:45.251
- I spoke with my father.
- Yeah?

25:46.086 --> 25:48.587
He was sleeping with her.

25:48.755 --> 25:50.798
With Laura.

25:50.966 --> 25:54.260
I don't know for how long,
maybe quite a while.

25:54.886 --> 25:56.845
Holy smokes.

25:57.013 --> 25:59.890
She was up at One-Eyed Jack's,
working there.

26:00.100 --> 26:03.018
And he owns the place,
that's what I found out.

26:03.228 --> 26:06.188
- He told you this?
- Yes.

26:08.024 --> 26:10.109
What are you gonna do?

26:11.111 --> 26:12.778
Harry.

26:13.530 --> 26:15.906
What are you gonna do?
Are you gonna arrest him?

26:16.992 --> 26:20.828
Audrey, I don't want you
to say a word about this to anyone.

26:21.830 --> 26:26.417
- Okay.
- Okay. Now, go on home.

26:35.135 --> 26:36.719
What's going on?

26:36.928 --> 26:39.888
Without chemicals he points.

26:40.056 --> 26:43.434
This morning at the Great Northern,
Mike reached for his arm and fainted

26:43.602 --> 26:47.563
just when a certain person
walked into the room.

26:49.024 --> 26:51.317
Harry, we need a warrant.

26:51.484 --> 26:54.862
A warrant for the arrest
of Benjamin Horne.

27:06.625 --> 27:08.334
Good news, Mr. Tojamura.

27:08.543 --> 27:11.253
My brother, Jerry,
spoke to your people in Osaka,

27:11.463 --> 27:13.922
checked your references
at the Tokyo bank,

27:14.132 --> 27:17.176
and the answer to your proposal,
my good friend,

27:17.344 --> 27:20.012
is a big thumbs up.

27:20.722 --> 27:24.224
We appreciate your promptness.

27:24.434 --> 27:27.311
Speaking for the entire community
of Twin Peaks,

27:27.520 --> 27:29.938
I cannot tell you how pleased we are

27:30.106 --> 27:33.525
to welcome you
into the Ghostwood fold.

27:33.693 --> 27:36.028
Thank you so much.

27:36.237 --> 27:41.450
- Contract. For your perusal.
- And a fast approval I...

27:43.119 --> 27:44.787
Sheriff.

27:47.999 --> 27:50.250
- What is this?
- This is police business.

27:50.418 --> 27:52.002
We'd like you to come with us.

27:53.088 --> 27:56.090
Fine. I happen to be in a meeting.

27:56.257 --> 27:59.176
Could you be a little more specific?

28:00.220 --> 28:05.307
You're wanted for questioning
in the murder of Laura Palmer.

28:05.517 --> 28:07.810
Is that specific enough for you?

28:13.525 --> 28:16.777
You're insane. Insane.

28:16.986 --> 28:19.446
Mr. Tojamura, I'm sure that this
is some dreadful mistake.

28:19.614 --> 28:21.490
You can come quietly

28:21.658 --> 28:24.576
or we can drag you through your lobby
in handcuffs.

28:26.788 --> 28:28.664
Cooper, is this some sort
of sick joke?

28:28.873 --> 28:31.792
Because if it is,
I know people in high places.

28:32.001 --> 28:34.378
You'd better do what he says.

28:40.009 --> 28:41.969
Go away.

28:42.137 --> 28:45.305
Get out of here. Go on, go on.

28:46.015 --> 28:48.350
I'm gonna go out for a sandwich.

28:49.602 --> 28:52.062
No! No! No!

28:52.272 --> 28:58.736
No! No!

29:01.239 --> 29:02.531
You...

29:03.616 --> 29:07.745
No! You can't do this to me.

29:07.912 --> 29:12.082
- It's already done.
- You...

30:13.144 --> 30:15.103
Leland.

30:41.798 --> 30:44.550
Take him down to the holding cell.

31:16.583 --> 31:20.002
We don't know what will happen
or when,

31:20.169 --> 31:24.673
but there are owls
in the Roadhouse.

31:26.009 --> 31:28.176
The Roadhouse.

31:30.513 --> 31:35.309
Something is happening,
isn't it, Margaret?

31:37.437 --> 31:38.729
Yes.

32:20.647 --> 32:21.980
Oh!

32:29.822 --> 32:31.907
Say, look here, buster,
you just watch it.

32:32.075 --> 32:36.078
Since the moment we met,
I have been strangely attracted to you.

32:36.245 --> 32:39.206
You just better get the hell out of here,
mister.

32:39.958 --> 32:43.794
There's
something about your eyes, so warm...

32:43.962 --> 32:45.712
...and deep.

32:46.881 --> 32:49.800
And blue as the sky.

32:53.513 --> 32:57.474
Dummy, it's me. It's me.

32:59.018 --> 33:00.352
Catherine?

33:04.315 --> 33:06.733
You look terrible.

33:10.738 --> 33:18.996
Just terrible. Ha, ha, ha.

34:49.670 --> 34:56.927
Tell your heart that I'm the one

35:01.182 --> 35:07.104
Tell your heart it's me

35:20.284 --> 35:23.662
- You heard about Harold Smith?
- Yeah.

35:26.541 --> 35:29.126
It's not anybody's fault.

35:29.335 --> 35:30.669
He was a sick man.

35:30.878 --> 35:34.881
I think he was hurt inside
in a way I couldn't figure out.

35:37.468 --> 35:39.970
Everybody's hurt inside.

35:42.765 --> 35:47.519
His whole life was in that house,
and I violated that.

35:48.563 --> 35:51.314
You were just trying to find out
about Laura.

35:54.402 --> 35:58.488
James, he's dead.

35:59.782 --> 36:02.242
He didn't deserve that.

36:03.703 --> 36:08.665
Shadow in my house

36:08.833 --> 36:14.254
The man, he has brown eyes

36:15.631 --> 36:17.340
Sheriff Truman.

36:22.847 --> 36:26.600
Love moves me

36:28.978 --> 36:39.446
I want you
Rockin' back inside my heart

36:39.614 --> 36:41.740
Maddy's leaving.

36:43.492 --> 36:45.243
She is?

36:46.412 --> 36:49.080
Yeah, she's gonna go home.

36:51.209 --> 36:55.462
That's weird.
She never said anything to me.

37:08.392 --> 37:14.898
Tell your heart you make me cry

37:19.695 --> 37:26.576
Tell your heart don't let me die

37:28.204 --> 37:41.216
I want you
Rockin' back inside my heart

37:42.301 --> 37:47.097
Rockin' back inside my heart

37:50.768 --> 37:55.855
Shadow in my house

38:03.739 --> 38:08.994
Dust is dancing in the space

38:15.835 --> 38:20.797
A dog and bird are far away

38:27.680 --> 38:34.561
The sun comes up and down
Each day

38:50.411 --> 39:01.254
It is happening again.

39:21.984 --> 39:23.068
Hm.

39:58.312 --> 40:00.313
Aunt Sarah?

40:02.066 --> 40:04.609
Uncle Leland?

40:04.777 --> 40:08.571
Aunt Sarah, Uncle Leland,
what is that smell?

40:08.739 --> 40:10.824
It smells like something's burning.

40:10.991 --> 40:13.618
Oh, my gosh. Aunt Sarah?

40:38.394 --> 40:40.061
Shh! Shh!

40:51.991 --> 40:56.703
Somebody, help me!

41:18.517 --> 41:21.936
Help me!

41:47.880 --> 41:51.132
Laura. Laura.

41:51.300 --> 41:55.512
Laura. Laura. Laura.

41:57.681 --> 42:01.392
Laura, my baby.

42:01.560 --> 42:05.021
Laura. Laura.

42:54.738 --> 42:57.282
Laura.

42:59.285 --> 43:01.786
Laura.

43:09.503 --> 43:11.754
Leland says...

43:12.256 --> 43:16.801
...you're going back to Missoula,
Montana!

44:36.965 --> 44:41.427
Dust is dancing in the space

44:47.893 --> 44:50.978
I'm so sorry.

45:00.489 --> 45:05.702
The sun comes up and down
Each day

45:12.167 --> 45:20.967
The river flows out to the sea

45:24.513 --> 45:31.352
Love, don't go away

45:31.562 --> 45:36.065
Come back this way

45:36.233 --> 45:40.445
Come back and stay

45:40.612 --> 47:28.135
Forever and ever
