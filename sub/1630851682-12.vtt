WEBVTT

00:03.803 --> 00:14.247
>>> MR. PRESIDENT --
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

00:14.247 --> 00:18.518
THE SITUATION IN UKRAINE IS
GROWING TENSER BY THE HOUR.
PUTIN HAS AMASSED OVER

00:18.518 --> 00:24.257
100,000 TROOPS AT THE BORDER.
>> WE'RE EVEN GETTING SOME
REPORTS THAT RUSSIA HAS ALREADY

00:24.257 --> 00:29.662
INVADED BUT THOSE ARE FROM THE
SAME PEOPLE WHO SAID TOM BRADY
RETIRED SO TAKE IT WE THE GRAIN

00:29.662 --> 00:35.035
OF SALT.
>> WHAT ABOUT THE NATO FORCE?
ARE THEY READY TO BACK US UP?

00:35.035 --> 00:43.043
>> EVERY COUNTRY IS SENDING
SUPPLIES TO UKRAINE EXCEPT
GERMANY.

00:43.043 --> 00:47.747
THEY'RE STAYING OUT OF IT.
>> IF GERMANY DOESN'T WANT TO GO
TO WAR, YOU KNOW IT'S BAD.

00:47.747 --> 00:52.185
>> RUSSIA'S MILITARY MAY BE THE
WORST OF OUR PROBLEMS.
>> WE HAVE BEEN TRACKING THE

00:52.185 --> 00:55.755
SPREAD OF RUSSIAN
DISINFORMATION, AND THERE ARE
SOME LIES UKRAINIANS DON'T KNOW

00:55.755 --> 01:01.461
WHO TO BELIEVE ANYMORE.
>> RUSSIA TRIED THAT DURING OR
LAST ELECTION, TOO, BUT IT

01:01.461 --> 01:08.335
DIDN'T WORK.
>> 40% OF AMERICANS THINK YOU
LOST THE ELECTION, SO IT KIND OF

01:08.335 --> 01:10.637
DID.
>>TAKE A LOOK AT THE POSTS THAT
ARE CIRCULATING ON UKRAINIAN

01:10.637 --> 01:14.908
FACEBOOK.
"UKRAINIAN BORDER ENCROACHING ON
RUSSIAN TROOPS."

01:14.908 --> 01:21.514
>> "RUSSIAN FORCES SURROUNDING
UKRAINE JUST TO GIVE IT BIG
HUG."

01:21.514 --> 01:24.184
>> "UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT HORNY
FOR DRAMA.
WANT WAR.

01:24.184 --> 01:28.955
SLAP ME HARDER, DADDY."
>> I'M GOING TO BREAK MY NEW
YEAR'S RESOLUTION AND SAY IT --

01:28.955 --> 01:36.363
LORDY.
>> THEY'RE ALSO BRINGING OUR
COUNTRY INTO IT.

01:36.363 --> 01:39.532
"AMERICAN CDC STRONGLY
RECOMMENDS RUSSIA INVADES
UKRAINE."

01:39.532 --> 01:42.869
>> DID THE CDC REALLY RECOMMEND
THAT?
>> YEAH, FOR A FEW MONTHS IN

01:42.869 --> 01:48.408
2020.
THE SCIENCE WAS CHANGING SO
FAST.

01:48.408 --> 01:51.578
>> THERE'S ALSO THIS --
"NEIL YOUNG TO REMOVE MUSIC FROM
SPOTIFY UNLESS UKRAINE

01:51.578 --> 01:59.552
SURRENDERS."
>> AND THIS ONE IS UNBELIEVABLE.
"ARE YOU A LONELY UKRAINIAN

01:59.552 --> 02:08.461
WOMAN IN SEARCH OF A GUY?
100,000 TROOPS ARE STANDING BY
TO TALK TO YOU AT

02:08.461 --> 02:14.200
SOLDIERSONLY.COM."
>> MY GOD.
I MEAN, IT IS A GOOD IDEA FOR A

02:14.200 --> 02:18.505
WEB SIDE.
>> THEY'RE TURNING OUR MOST
BELOVED HEROES AGAINST US.

02:18.505 --> 02:26.546
"I DON'T ALWAYS GET INVADED BUT
WHEN I DO, I PREFER RUSSIA."
>> NOT TO MENTION THIS -- "WHY I

02:26.546 --> 02:33.486
GOT TO BE UKRAINIAN WHEN RUSSIA
TWO FEET AWAY".
NOTHING SACRED TO THEM, NOT EVEN

02:33.486 --> 02:39.759
GUY CHECK OUT HOT GIRL.
>> IT'S NOT ONLY MEMES.
LOOK AT THIS VIDEO A RUSSIAN SPY

02:39.759 --> 02:55.141
POSTED ON TIKTOK.
* ALL MY LADIES POP *
>> WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?

02:55.141 --> 03:01.648
>> SIR, IT'S A VIDEO WITH
8.7 MILLION VIEWS.
>> NO, NO, I MEAN WHAT THE HELL

03:01.648 --> 03:06.252
WAS THAT DANCING?
THE CHOREOGRAPHY WASN'T EVEN
CRISP.

03:06.252 --> 03:11.658
I'VE GOT LOG IN AND FLAME THOSE
GUYS IN MY COMMENTS.
>> UNFORTUNATELY, MR. PRESIDENT,

03:11.658 --> 03:19.766
THIS GOES BEYOND SOCIAL MEDIA.
LOOK AT THIS COMMERCIAL AIRING
ON UKRAINIAN MTV.

03:19.766 --> 03:25.338
>> I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE.
I'M TYPICAL UKRAINIAN TEENAGER
AND HAVE NO HOPE FOR MY FUTURE.

03:25.338 --> 03:29.409
>> THAT'S WHY I'M THINKING OF
GOING RUSSIA.
>> RUSSIA?

03:29.409 --> 03:34.080
YOU MEAN THE LAND OF WEALTH AND
FREEDOM?
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

03:34.080 --> 03:43.123
I HEAR YOU CAN GET A JOB IN
RUSSIA RIGHT AWAY, MINING
ARSENIC AND POTASH.

03:43.123 --> 03:48.862
WHATEVER YOU DON'T USE FOR
FERTILIZER YOU CAN GOAT EAT.
>> BUT RUSSIA IS TOO POPULARLE

03:48.862 --> 03:56.403
WE'LL NEVER GET IN.
>> YOU'RE RIGHT.
IF ONLY RUSSIA -- COME TO US.

03:56.403 --> 04:04.144
>> STUDENTS FOR THE RUSSIAN
NATION OF UKRAINE.
>> THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

04:04.144 --> 04:11.051
NOW, WHICH ONE OF THOSE TWO WAS
ZENDAYA?
>> SIR, THESE PRO RUSSIA

04:11.051 --> 04:14.688
COMMERCIALS ARE SATURATING
UKRAINIAN TELEVISION.
I MEAN, LOOK AT THIS ONE.

04:14.688 --> 04:23.630
>> OH, NO, I AM AMERICAN
BALLPLAYER AARON RODGERS, AND MY
CAR HAS BROKEN DOWN IN UKRAINE.

04:23.630 --> 04:28.068
ONLY ONE THING DO.
LIKE A GOOD NEIGHBOR, RUSSIA IS
THERE.

04:28.068 --> 04:32.372
HELLO TO YOU, AARON RODGERS.
NEED SOME HELP.
>> JAKE FROM RUSSIA.

04:32.372 --> 04:37.644
CAN YOU GET ME OUT OF UKRAINE?
>> OF COURSE.
WILL I TAKE TO YOU MEET OUR

04:37.644 --> 04:42.916
PRESIDENT.
HE WOULD LOVE TO SEE YOUR SUPER
BOWL RING AND MAYBE HOLD IT FOR

04:42.916 --> 04:47.887
A WHILE?
**
>> LIKE A GOOD NEIGHBOR, YOU ARE

04:47.887 --> 04:51.591
IN RUSSIA.
>> THERE YOU GO.
>> YOU'RE TELLING ME UKRAINIANS

04:51.591 --> 04:56.629
ARE SUPPOSED TO BELIEVE THAT'S
THE REAL AARON ROGERS?
>> APPARENTLY THAT IS THE REAL

04:56.629 --> 04:59.733
AARON RODGERS.
I GUESS HE LEFT TO PACKERS TO
PLAY IN RUSSIA.

04:59.733 --> 05:05.071
>> WHAT CAN WE DO TO FIGHT BACK
AGAINST ALL THIS PROPAGANDA?
>> WELL, WE HAVE TO FIGHT FIRE

05:05.071 --> 05:11.244
WITH FIRE.
THAT'S WHY I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE
YOU TO OUR NEW SECRETARY OF

05:11.244 --> 05:16.049
DEFENSE, MAKAYLA.
>> HI.
I'M MAKAYLA, SPELLED THE WORST

05:16.049 --> 05:19.085
WAY.
I'M A JUNIOR AT A VICIOUS GIRLS
HIGH SCHOOL, AND Y'ALL WORK FOR

05:19.085 --> 05:23.289
ME NOW.
>> HOLD ON.
THE CIA MUST HAVE OPERATIVES ON

05:23.289 --> 05:34.134
SOCIAL MEDIA ALREADY.
>> OH, THEY DO, AND IT'S ROUGH.
LOOK AT WHAT YOUR AGENTS MADE.

05:34.134 --> 05:39.205
"I LIKE DEMOCRACY.
THEN DON'T SIDE WITH ME I'M
RUSSIA"?

05:39.205 --> 05:43.710
>> OH, MY GOD.
>> I KNOW.
THE ONLY THING MORE PATHETIC WAS

05:43.710 --> 05:49.949
THEIR ATTEMPT AT TIKTOK.
**
* WHEN I POPPED OFF

05:49.949 --> 05:55.755
THEN YOUR GIRL GAVE ME
JUST A LITTLE BIT OF A *
>> WHAT DOES THAT EVEN MEAN?

05:55.755 --> 06:03.129
IT ALMOST LOOKS LIKE IF RUSSIA
INVADES IT WOULD TURN OLD
UKRAINIAN WOMEN INTO SEXY

06:03.129 --> 06:09.369
NURSES.
>> LET'S DO SOMETHING FUN
EVERYONE CAN GET BY, LIKE A

06:09.369 --> 06:13.073
DRONE STRIKE.
>> I THINK YOUR GENERATION CAN
LEARN A LOT FROM MINE.

06:13.073 --> 06:17.911
LIKE, WE DON'T BELIEVE IN DRONE
STRIKES.
WE BELIEVE IN BREAKING DOWN OUR

06:17.911 --> 06:24.050
ENEMIES PSYCHOLOGICALLY.
THAT'S WHY I'M GOING TO DM PUTIN
AND SAY, OH, MY GOD, I LOVED

06:24.050 --> 06:30.924
YOUR OUTFIT THE OTHER DAY.
WAS THAT OLD NAVY?
ALREADY HE'S SPIRALING.

06:30.924 --> 06:33.259
HE'S LIKE, "DO THEY THINK I'M
POOR?"
IN THREE WEEKS, I WILL HAVE HIM

06:33.259 --> 06:40.600
DROPPING OUT OF RUSSIA.
>> HAVE YOU DONE THIS BEFORE?
>> DOES THE NAME GIULIANI RING A

06:40.600 --> 06:46.539
BELL
>> LIVE FROM NEW YORK, IT'S
SATURDAY NIGHT!

06:51.845 --> 06:57.917
>> Announcer: IT'S "SATURDAY
NIGHT LIVE"!
WITH --

07:15.402 --> 07:45.665
**
**

08:21.034 --> 08:44.858
FEATURING --

08:44.858 --> 08:55.335
FEATURING --
MUSICAL GUEST, KATY PERRY.
AND YOUR HOST, WILLEM DAFOE.

08:59.806 --> 09:20.427
WILLEM DAFOE.
**
>> THANK YOU.

09:20.427 --> 09:23.029
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
IT'S GREAT TO BE BACK HOME IN
NEW YORK.

09:23.029 --> 09:31.538
THIS IS WHERE I STARTED.
I MOVED HERE WHEN I WAS 21.
HAD NO MONEY AND RENTED AN

09:31.538 --> 09:36.443
APARTMENT ON 10th AND AVENUE
A FOR 200 BUCKS A MONTH.
THAT'S WHERE I LEARNED HOW TO

09:36.443 --> 09:40.714
ACT.
FOR EXAMPLE, I HAD TO ACT LIKE
I ENJOYED HAVING A BATHTUB IN MY

09:40.714 --> 09:46.319
KITCHEN.
I GOT STARTED IN EXPERIMENTAL
THEATER.

09:46.319 --> 09:54.260
I WAS AN ORIGINAL MEMBER OF THE
WOOSTER GROUP.
AND THAT BACKGROUND REALLY

09:54.260 --> 10:02.736
TAUGHT ME HOW TO THROW MYSELF
INTO A ROLE.
SOME PEOPLE TELL ME THAT MY

10:02.736 --> 10:05.372
ACTING IS OVER THE TOP, BUT TO
ME, ONE MAN'S OVER THE TOP IS
ANOTHER MAN'S ENGAGED

10:05.372 --> 10:12.212
PERFORMANCE.
FOR INSTANCE, IN THIS SCENE,
PEOPLE ASSUME I'M ABOUT TO TOSS

10:12.212 --> 10:24.024
SOMEBODY OFF A BUILDING.
WHEN IN REALITY, I WAS JUST
READING A REALLY GOOD BOOK.

10:24.024 --> 10:28.395
LOOK, I CAN'T HELP THAT I HAVE
AN EXPRESSIVE FACE.
I CAN'T CONTROL IT.

10:28.395 --> 10:32.098
I DON'T THINK ABOUT CONTROLLING
IT.
I'M NOT ONE OF THOSE SUBTLE

10:32.098 --> 10:37.404
ACTORS, LIKE NICOLAS CAGE OR
AL PACINO.
MAYBE THAT'S WHY PEOPLE COME UP

10:37.404 --> 10:42.709
TO ME AND SAY, "YOU KNOW WHAT
ROLE YOU'D BE PERFECT FOR?
THE JOKER."

10:42.709 --> 10:50.917
ALWAYS NICE TO HEAR THAT YOU GOT
THE VIBE OF A SOCIOPATH.
LISTEN, I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL

10:50.917 --> 10:59.926
FOR COMING OUT IN THIS
SNOWSTORM.
YOU KNOW, WHEN I WAS A KID IN

10:59.926 --> 11:06.666
APPLETON, WISCONSIN, WINTERS
WERE --
>> EXCUSE ME.

11:06.666 --> 11:10.603
DID SOMEONE SAY APPLETON,
WISCONSIN?
>> YEAH, I DID.

11:10.603 --> 11:15.175
>> WELL, YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO
BELIEVE THIS, BUT WE'RE FROM
APPLETON, TOO.

11:15.175 --> 11:17.944
>> YEP.
BORN AND RAISED.
>> THAT'S NICE.

11:17.944 --> 11:21.081
YOU CAME HERE TO SUPPORT ONE OF
YOUR OWN.
>> NO.

11:21.081 --> 11:26.886
NO.
WE GOT TICKETS FROM THE LOTTERY.
>> YEAH.

11:26.886 --> 11:29.723
HAD NO IDEA YOU WERE HOSTIN,
BUT WE'RE HUGE FANS.
I MEAN, WE'VE SEEN ALL OF YOUR

11:29.723 --> 11:32.192
"SPIDER-MAN" MOVIES.
"SPIDER-MAN."
"SPIDER-MAN 2."

11:32.192 --> 11:38.465
"SPIDER-MAN" THE NEW ONE.
>> YOU KNOW, I HAVE DONE OTHER
FILMS.

11:38.465 --> 11:41.501
>> OH, YEAH, WE KNOW.
WE KNOW.
WE LOVED YOU IN "FULL METAL

11:41.501 --> 11:45.271
JACKET."
>> I ACTUALLY WASN'T IN THAT
ONE.

11:45.271 --> 11:52.679
MAYBE YOU'RE THINKING OF
"PLATOON."
>> NO, NO.

11:52.679 --> 11:55.849
>> AND YOU WERE GREAT IN "THE
PASSION OF THE CHRIST."
>> I WASN'T IN THAT ONE, EITHER.

11:55.849 --> 12:04.524
I WAS IN "LAST TEMPTATION OF
CHRIST."
>> OH, WELL, WHAT ABOUT "SPEED 2

12:04.524 --> 12:08.194
CRUISE CONTROL"?
>> THAT WAS YOU IN "SPEED 2,"
RIGHT?

12:08.194 --> 12:12.932
>> THAT WAS ME.
>> WELL, APPLETON IS JUST SO
PROUD OF YOU.

12:12.932 --> 12:19.272
I MEAN, YOU'RE OUT THERE MAKING
MOVIES WITH BIG HOLLYWOOD STARS
LIKE TIMOTHY CHALAMET AND SHREK.

12:19.272 --> 12:23.643
>> WE JUST WISH YOU STILL HAD
YOUR WISCONSIN ACCENT.
>> WELL, I CAN STILL SPEAK

12:23.643 --> 12:30.750
WISCONSIN.
>> OH, WELL, CAN YOU DO IT FOR
US?

12:30.750 --> 12:34.654
>> YEAH, I BET EVERYONE BACK
HOME WOULD JUST FLIP IF YOU DID
A REAL WISCONSIN ACCENT ON TV.

12:34.654 --> 12:41.227
>> OKAY, SURE.
HEY, YOU GUYS, LET'S GO DOWN TO
CRAMBOS AND GET A DRINK FROM THE

12:41.227 --> 12:53.807
BUBBLER.
>> OH, YOU STILL GOT IT!
>> YEAH!

12:53.807 --> 12:55.375
HEY.
HAS ANYONE TOLD YOU YOU SHOULD
PLAY THE JOKER?

12:55.375 --> 13:03.316
>> WE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU
TONIGHT.
KATY PERRY IS HERE.

13:03.316 --> 13:08.521
KATY PERRY IS HERE.
SO STICK AROUND.
AND WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

13:17.163 --> 13:25.572
WELCOME TO THE FIRST TENANTS
ASSOCIATION MEETING OF 2022.
I KNOW WE USUALLY HAVE COFFEE

13:25.572 --> 13:31.911
AND MUNCHKINS AT THIS MEETING
BUT I FORGOT TO PICK THEM UP.
>> THEN WHY AM I EVEN HERE?

13:31.911 --> 13:36.950
SHAME ON YOU!
>> WOW, SHEILA.
OKAY, WE'LL NOW HERE TENANT

13:36.950 --> 13:44.391
COMPLAINTS AND CONCERNS, BUT
REMEMBER WE'RE ALL NEIGHBORS IN
THIS BUILDING SO LET'S PLEASE

13:44.391 --> 13:48.361
KEEP IT CIVIL.
YES, MISS D'ALESSIO FROM UNIT
7E.

13:48.361 --> 13:52.098
>> WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?
YOU RAISED MY MAINTENANCE FEE UP
$12 THIS MONTH!

13:52.098 --> 13:57.904
>> WELL, WE HAD TO FIX A LEAK IN
THE ROOF.
>> WELL, THIS JUST IN, I DON'T

13:57.904 --> 14:02.676
LIVE ON THE ROOF SO I'M NOT
PAYING IT!
>> WE'RE JUST GOING TO SEND YOU

14:02.676 --> 14:05.879
ANOTHER BILL.
NEXT, MISS QUINCY FROM 2F.
>> HELLO.

14:05.879 --> 14:12.185
I WOULD LIKE TO FORMALLY ASK THE
BOARD PERMISSION'S TO KILL MY
NEIGHBOR'S LOUD, STUPID, YAPPY

14:12.185 --> 14:15.922
DOG.
>> OBVIOUSLY, PERMISSION IS
DENIED.

14:15.922 --> 14:27.067
>> BITCH, DON'T NEED IT.
I WAS ASKING AS A COURTESY.
>> MISS QUINCY, NO.

14:27.067 --> 14:29.669
MISS WILSON?
>> I AM LIVID RIGHT NOW.
THE LAUNDRY MACHINES IN THIS

14:29.669 --> 14:33.406
BUILDING ARE A DISGRACE.
I WASH MY 13-YEAR-OLD SON'S
SOCKS EVERY WEEK.

14:33.406 --> 14:37.610
BUT A DAY LATER, TADA, THEY TURN
HARD AS A ROCK.
HEAR THAT?

14:37.610 --> 14:43.950
HEAR THAT?
I WILL GO TO THE NEWS WITH THIS
IF THE MACHINES ARE NOT FIXED.

15:02.502 --> 15:06.373
MY NAME IS ROBERT.
I LET IT SLIDE AT FIRST, BUT

FOR ALL YOU WHO DON'T KNOW ME,
I'M JED FILLMOORE.
I BOUGHT THE TOP THREE FLOORS OF

15:55.455 --> 16:01.327
THIS BUILDING IN 1971 FOR $11
AND IT'S BEEN A PAIN IN THE ASS
EVER SINCE.

16:01.327 --> 16:10.570
MY QUESTION IS, WHAT THE HELL
HAPPENED TO THIS CITY?
WHERE'S THE DANGER, MAN?

16:10.570 --> 16:12.672
WHERE'S THE ART?
BACK IN MY DAY, IT WAS ALL PIMPS
AND WHORES, JUNKIES AND PERVERTS

16:12.672 --> 16:18.044
ALL OVER TIMES SQUARE, MAN.
IT WAS GREAT.
YOU GO TO CBGB'S AND IGGY POP

16:18.044 --> 16:24.818
WOULD PUKE ON YOUR FACE AND WE
LIKED IT!
WHERE DID THAT CITY GO, MAN?

16:24.818 --> 16:32.559
>> NO IDEA.
AND WHAT IS YOUR QUESTION?
>> I DON'T HAVE ONE.

16:32.559 --> 16:37.397
I JUST WANTED TO BE A PAIN IN
THE ASS.
>> OKAY.

23:33.580 --> 23:36.750
THEY'RE JUST LIKE US, SOME OF
THEM BY KIDS.
>> THAT'S CORRECT.

23:36.750 --> 23:42.989
THIS SHOW CELEBRATES THOSE
CANINE FREAKS WHO PREVENT OWNERS
FROM HAVING COMPANY OR INTIMACY.

23:42.989 --> 23:46.493
>> TODAY IS FOR THEM.
>> HERE COME OUR JUDGES,
JANE BOSWORTH AND

23:46.493 --> 23:54.401
MICKEY BOSWORTH.
>> THEY RUN A DESERT-BASED DOG
RANCH THAT'S EITHER AN ANIMAL

23:54.401 --> 23:59.906
RESCUE OR A HOARDING SITUATION.
>> THE DOGS KNOW NOT TO MESS
WITH THEM, AND, FRANKLY, NEITHER

23:59.906 --> 24:08.281
WOULD I.
AND HERE'S OUR FIRST COMPETITOR.
FROM THE SHAKING GROUP, IT'S

24:08.281 --> 24:09.916
LUNA.
>> NOW, LUNA HATES THE SOUND
"BEEP."

24:09.916 --> 24:18.324
AND IF SHE HEARS IT, SHE WILL
TRY AND CLIMB UP TO YOUR HAIR.
FOR HER, THE FOURTH OF JULY IS A

24:18.324 --> 24:30.503
WAR, AND THE ONLY SAFE SPACE IS
BEHIND THE TOILET.
>> LUNA IS ALSO SCARED OF

24:30.503 --> 24:37.544
PLASTIC BAGS, MEN IN HATS,
PINEAPPLES, BALLOONS,
THE NETFLIX START-UP SOUND,

24:37.544 --> 24:44.951
HER OWNERS BEING IN TWO SEPARATE
ROOMS, AND -- THIS IS
EMBARRASSING -- THE SOUND OF

24:44.951 --> 24:53.793
SPOKEN SPANISH.
>> SHE ALSO HAS WHAT THE VET
CALLS "TANGY VAGAINY."

24:53.793 --> 24:56.496
>> A VET SAID THAT?
>> YEAH, SHE DID.
LET'S GO TO THE JUDGES.

24:56.496 --> 24:59.766
>> TELL US ABOUT LUNA.
>> IF HER FAVORITE BLANKET IS
NOT FLUFFED CORRECTLY, SHE WILL

24:59.766 --> 25:11.111
CRY REAL TEARS UNTIL I FIX IT.
IF MY BOYFRIEND COMES HOME AND
NEAR SITTING ME ON THE COUCH,

25:11.111 --> 25:13.079
SHE WILL SCREAM UNTIL HE LEAVES.
MY LIFE IS HELL AND I MISS MY
FRIENDS.

25:13.079 --> 25:15.715
>> THAT'S GOOD.
>> YEAH, TAKE HER ROUND?
>> UH-HUH.

25:15.715 --> 25:20.186
>> NO, NO.
>> DON'T CLAP.
>> IF THESE DOGS HEAR ANY SOUND,

25:20.186 --> 25:26.359
THEY WILL KILL.
>> PLEASE DO NOT CLAP.
>> A REMINDER FROM THE JUDGES

25:26.359 --> 25:32.065
NOT TO CLAP.
>> NEXT FROM THE MEAN GROUP,
IT'S PIGEON.

25:32.065 --> 25:36.269
>> PIGEON IS A SEXUAL PREDATOR
WHO HAS BEEN BANNED FROM EVERY
DOG PARK IN THE STATE OF

25:36.269 --> 25:41.074
MARYLAND.
>> THE VET CALLED HIM "NOT
WELCOME HERE" AND THE GROOMER

25:41.074 --> 25:50.517
CALLED HIM "MANIPULATIVE."
>> PIGEON ONCE TRIPPED AN OLD
LADY ON PURPOSE.

25:50.517 --> 25:54.387
>> HIS OWNER SAID, QUOTE, IT
LOOKED LIKE AN ACCIDENT BUT I
SWEAR TO GOD, I SAW HIM LAUGH.

25:54.387 --> 26:03.063
LET'S CHECK IN WITH THE JUDGES.
>> WELL, WHAT IS PIGEON'S DAILY
ROUTINE?

26:03.063 --> 26:06.266
>> HE WAKES ME UP AT 5:00 A.M.
BY BITING MY FEET.
THEN, HE GOES IN THE HAMPER,

26:06.266 --> 26:08.902
GRABS MY GIRLFRIEND'S UNDERWEAR,
DRAGS IT UNDER THE DINING ROOM
TABLE AND BARKS AGGRESSIVELY.

26:08.902 --> 26:14.174
>> I SEE.
AND WHY DID YOU CHOOSE THIS
MONSTER?

26:14.174 --> 26:17.844
>> OH, WELL, WHEN WE FIRST GOT
HIM, HE WAS SO QUIET.
TURNS OUT HE WAS JUST

26:17.844 --> 26:23.783
TRAUMATIZED.
THIS IS BAD TO SAY, BUT I MISS
THAT VERSION OF HIM.

26:23.783 --> 26:27.287
>> THANK YOU.
>> WOW.
NOW, JUDAS, IT SAYS HERE THAT

26:27.287 --> 26:31.624
YOU AND I ARE MARRIED.
ISN'T THAT RIGHT?
>> THAT IS RIGHT.

26:31.624 --> 26:39.232
AND NOW WE DO THIS.
>> YES!
WELL, FROM THE NONWALKING GROUP,

26:39.232 --> 26:43.803
IT'S BLUEBERRY.
>> SORRY.
BLUEBERRY, COME ON.

26:43.803 --> 26:47.540
BLUEBERRY, PLEASE.
BLUEBERRY, I'M NOT PICKING YOU
UP.

26:47.540 --> 26:52.812
BLUEBERRY, WE FLEW HERE.
BLUEBERRY, YOU GROUNDED A
FLIGHT.

26:52.812 --> 27:00.020
>> BLUEBERRY ONCE SLID ON A TILE
FLOOR, AND IT PERMANENTLY MADE
HIM INSANE.

27:00.020 --> 27:05.291
>> YES.
HE WILL ONLY POOP IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE STREET AND HE IS

27:05.291 --> 27:08.061
MEDICALLY UNABLE TO BE IN A CAR.
>> AND TO BE CLEAR, BLUEBERRY
CAN WALK, HE JUST CHOOSES NOT

27:08.061 --> 27:13.667
TO.
>> AMAZING.
TRULY POINTLESS.

27:13.667 --> 27:22.142
>> AND LASTLY, FROM THE MEDICAL
GROUP, IT'S GIZMO.
>> NOW, GIZMO HAS BAD FEET, BAD

27:22.142 --> 27:25.845
SKIN, BAD TEETH, BAD ANAL
GLANDS, AND A BAD BRAIN.
THE TOTAL PACKAGE.

27:25.845 --> 27:32.352
>> HE'S ALLERGIC TO ANYTHING
THAT IS OR ISN'T DUCK.
JUDGES SQUINTING AT SOMETHING ON

27:32.352 --> 27:40.060
HIS TUMMY.
>> CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT HIS
WEIRD LITTLE PENIS?

27:40.060 --> 27:43.697
>> YES.
HIS WEIRD LITTLE DOG PENIS IS
TOO BIG FOR HIS FRAME, SO WHEN

27:43.697 --> 27:47.400
HE BENDS DOWN A CERTAIN WAY, IT
GETS STUCK OUTSIDE HIS BODY FOR
HOURS AND IT DRIES OUT SO IT

27:47.400 --> 27:50.570
WON'T GO BACK IN.
AND IT HAS TO BE LUBRICATED AND
REINSERTED BY A VETERINARIAN

27:50.570 --> 27:55.308
SEVERAL TIMES A WEEK.
I HATE SAYING THAT, AND I SAY IT
A LOT.

27:55.308 --> 28:01.147
>> THANK YOU.
>> THANK YOU.
>> WELL.

28:01.147 --> 28:07.220

28:30.777 --> 28:32.412

29:05.045 --> 29:08.748
>> LOWER DRIVE?
CAN'T GET HARD ANYMORE?
>> WELL, LOWER DRIVE.

29:08.748 --> 29:12.452
>> IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.
IT HAPPENS TO EVERY MAN.
TESTOSTERONE LEVELS DROP AS YOU

29:12.452 --> 29:15.622
AGE.
THAT'S WHY YOU CAN'T GET HARD
ANYMORE.

29:15.622 --> 29:20.894
>> I DIDN'T SAY THAT.
HOLY CRAP, DOUG FLUTIE?
>> YES.

29:20.894 --> 29:23.730

THERE'S A THREAT OF LAND WAR IN
EUROPE, SO IT LOOKS LIKE

35:05.739 --> 35:12.312
DEMOCRATS WERE RIGHT --
JOE BIDEN IS THE NEXT FDR.
PRESIDENT BIDEN IS WORKING TO

35:12.312 --> 35:16.316
PREVENT A WAR BETWEEN RUSSIA AND
UKRAINE, AND HE SAID A VIDEO
CALL BETWEEN EUROPEAN ALLIES

35:16.316 --> 35:20.053
WENT, "VERY, VERY, VERY WELL."
YEAH, IT'S THE THIRD "VERY" THAT
WORRIES ME.

TRYING TO COVER FOR SOMETHING
THAT'S GOING REALLY BADLY.

THAT GIRL WAS VERY, VERY, VERY
OVER 18.

UKRAINIAN OFFICIALS ARE SAYING
THE REPEATED WARNINGS OF
INVASION ARE CAUSE FOR PANIC AND

TO GET US TO DO THIS SHOW DURING

BUT IN FOOTBALL NEWS, DID YOU

HEAR THE RUMORS THAT TOM BRADY
MAY BE RETIRING.
>> YEAH.

44:53.827 --> 44:56.996

I THINK IT'S PROBABLY JUST
SPECULATION.

BUT IF IT WERE ME, I PROBABLY
WOULD RETIRE, TOO, IF IT GAVE ME
MORE TIME TO WATCH "EMILY IN

45:01.901 --> 45:07.040

EARLY ON, THE Os WERE GETTING
COMPLETELY DOMINATED BY THE Xs,

YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.
>> I DO NOT, KNOW.

>> GABRIEL, MATHIEU CADAULT,
TIMOTHY, DOUG FROM CHICAGO,
OBVIOUSLY.

45:31.731 --> 45:36.503
NOW EMILY WANTS TO GO DEEP ON A
RELATIONSHIP WITH GABRIEL, AND
TO GET AHEAD AT WORK.

45:36.503 --> 45:39.673
BUT AS LONG AS CAMILLE IS
BLOCKING HER, SHE'S GOT TO GO
THROUGH HER PROGRESSIONS AND

45:39.673 --> 45:46.079
CHECK DOWN TO ALFIE IN THE
FLATS.
SURE, IT FEELS LIKE A BROKEN

45:46.079 --> 45:51.284

BUT EMOTIONALLY, SHE'S MAKING
FORWARD PROGRESS.

MUCH TIME DO YOU SPEND ON THIS?

TRUE TO ALFIE?

>> BUT YOU KNOW WHAT'S NOT
SITTING ON THE SIDELINES?

STRIPED PARACHUTE PANTS,
PLAID NEWSBOY HATS, FUR-TRIMMED

CARDIGAN, AND FINGERLESS DRIVING
GLOVES?
SHE MIGHT NOT BE DRIVING A CAR,

46:30.724 --> 46:35.462
BUT SHE SURE KNOWS HOW TO DRIVE
AN EPISODE DOWN THE FIELD WITH
THESE LEWKS.

46:35.462 --> 46:41.167
BY THE WAY, THAT'S LOOKS BUT
IT'S SPELLED L-E-W-K.
>> THANKS, MAN.

46:41.167 --> 46:47.774
YEAH, I GOT IT.
HONESTLY I JUST CANNOT BELIEVE
THAT YOU JUST SPENT TREN

46:47.774 --> 46:54.180

QUARTERBACK DUELS IN HISTORY.
>> SURE, WATCHING FOOTBALL WAS

46:57.350 --> 47:00.020
THE SAFE THING TO DO.
THAT'S WHAT EVERYONE EXPECTED ME
TO DO.

47:00.020 --> 47:03.690
BUT IF I'VE LEARNED ANYTHING
FROM EMILY, IT'S TO FOLLOW MY
PASSIONS AND ALWAYS BE TRUE TO

47:03.690 --> 47:10.063
MYSELF.
THE FRENCH HAVE A SAYING --
PARLEZ-VOUS FRANCAIS?

47:10.063 --> 47:15.268
THE FRENCH HAVE A SAYING --
PARLEZ-VOUS FRANCAIS?
WHICH MEANS, "YOU DO YOU, GIRL."

47:20.540 --> 47:28.548
>> I DON'T SPEAK FRENCH, COLIN.
BUT THANKS TO EMILY, I SPEAK
LOVE.

47:28.548 --> 47:30.850
>> WOW.
SO YOU THINK SEASON TWO WAS EVEN
BETTER THAN SEASON ONE.

47:30.850 --> 47:33.386
>> WAIT.
THERE'S A SEASON ONE?
>> PEYTON MANNING, EVERYONE.

47:57.077 --> 48:03.350

48:03.350 --> 48:11.324
AGAIN, JUST FOR A MOMENT.
>> WELL, PERHAPS THERE IS A WAY.

HE WOULD BE A FOOL IF HE DIDN'T.
>> OKAY, SO, I AM JUST SHAKING.

48:44.624 --> 48:51.064
I AM DEFINITELY ALONE THEN.
NOBODY HERE IN THE COTTAGE,
EXCEPT LITTLE, OLD ME.

48:51.064 --> 48:57.303
CRAZY OLD MAURICE.
>> UH-OH.
>> WHAT?

48:57.303 --> 49:01.574
>> WELL, IT SEEMS LIKE YOUR
FATHER REALLY WANTS TO MAKE SURE
HE'S ALONE.

49:01.574 --> 49:05.745
>> WELL, HE'S NEVER BEEN BY
HIMSELF BEFORE.
HE'S PROBABLY FRIGHTENED.

49:05.745 --> 49:10.684
>> YEAH, I THINK WE'RE THE ONES
WHO SHOULD BE FRIGHTENED.
* THIS IS THE BEST DAY OF MY

49:10.684 --> 49:19.459
LIFE *
>> YEP, YEP, HERE WE GO.
HE'S LIGHTING ALL THE CANDLES

49:19.459 --> 49:21.561
NOW.
>> WELL, MAYBE HE IS COLD.
>> NOPE.

49:21.561 --> 49:23.697
NOT A SHOT.
I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT'S HAPPENING
HERE.

49:23.697 --> 49:29.102
>> YEAH, BUT WHAT'S HE DOING
NOW?
>> DON'T LOOK AT ME.

49:29.102 --> 49:33.673
DON'T LOOK AT ME.
DON'T LOOK AT ME!
DON'T LOOK AT ME!

49:33.673 --> 49:40.380
LOOK AT ME.
>> HE JUST SEEMS TO BE SO LOST
WITHOUT ME.

49:40.380 --> 49:50.123
>> BELLE, THIS GUY'S NOT
THINKING ABOUT YOU AT ALL, AND
IF HE IS, WE'VE GOT BIGGER

49:50.123 --> 50:00.600
PROBLEMS.
>> WHAT'S HE DOING NOW?
**

50:00.600 --> 50:05.972
>> WELL, THAT'S NOT SOMETHING
YOU SEE EVERY DAY.
>> I'LL TELL YOU ONE THING --

50:05.972 --> 50:14.280
THE MIRROR NEVER DISAPPOINTS.
>> OKAY, MAYBE HE SHOULD DO
SOMETHING ELSE.

50:14.280 --> 50:17.517
ANYBODY WANT TO SING "BE OUR
GUEST" AGAIN?
IT'S A REALLY FUN, COOL SONG.

50:17.517 --> 50:20.653
>> MAYBE LATER.
>> OUCH!
HARDER!

50:20.653 --> 50:25.458
OUCH!

OUCH!

50:25.458 --> 50:31.064
OUCH.

50:31.064 --> 50:35.869
>> OKAY, OKAY, I THINK WE'VE
SEEN ENOUGH.
ANYONE ELSE WANT TO LOOK IN THE

50:35.869 --> 50:39.606
MIRROR.
>> QUIET, THE STRANGEST THING OF
ALL IS HAPPENING.

50:39.606 --> 50:48.982
>> OH, MY LADY, LOOK AT HOW I'M
CARRYING ON SINCE YOUR PASSING.
I JUST WISH YOU WERE HOLDING ME

50:48.982 --> 50:59.359
CLOSE AND KISSING MY NECK,
STROKING MY HAIR, STOMPING ON MY
GROIN, SPANKING MY ASS!

50:59.359 --> 51:07.400
BITING MY ASS!
SO MANY WONDERFUL THINGS WITH MY
ASS.

51:07.400 --> 51:10.804
>> OH!
OOPS, I BROKE THE MIRROR.
TOTAL ACCIDENT.

51:10.804 --> 51:15.709
CAN'T BELIEVE IT.
ANY WAYS, SEE EVERYONE AT DINNER
AND

51:15.709 --> 51:19.079
* LET'S NEVER TALK ABOUT THIS
AGAIN *
>> I CAN'T BELIEVE SHE BROKE THE

51:19.079 --> 51:26.086
MIRROR.
>> DON'T WORRY, GUYS, I GOT LIKE
30 MORE IN MY ROOM.

51:26.086 --> 51:29.856
>> WAIT, I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
WHAT HAPPENED IN THAT OLD MAN'S
COTTAGE?

51:29.856 --> 51:38.298
* A TALE AS OL AS TIME *
>> WHICH IS A SONG I WOULD SING
IF I HAD THE RIGHTS.

51:43.136 --> 51:46.106
>>> I KNOW, DUDE.
BUT THAT'S LIKE JAMIE'S WHOLE
DEAL.

51:46.106 --> 51:49.943

51:56.649 --> 51:58.184
>> CONNER, IF I GET TAPAS, DO
YOU WANT IN?
>> THE USUAL.

51:58.184 --> 52:03.256
WHAT DO I OWE YOU?
>> DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
YOU GOT UBER LAST NIGHT.

52:03.256 --> 52:08.061
>> COME ON, GUYS, SERIOUSLY.
WE HAVE TO GET TO WRITING.
>> IS CONNER PRACTICING VIOLIN?

52:08.061 --> 52:14.601
>> YES, JUST IGNORE ME.
>> A NEEDS TO PRACTICE.
>> IS JOST AROUND?

52:14.601 --> 52:20.507

52:26.880 --> 52:28.381
>> JUST A NERD.
DO YOU WANT TAPAS OR JUST ME AND
THE "C" TRAIN.

52:32.719 --> 52:34.888
10-YEAR-OLD?
>> BECAUSE WE GET ALONG, MAN.
I WAS TIRED OF ONLY HANG OUGHT

52:34.888 --> 52:37.323
WITH TOXIC WORK FRIENDS.
>> TOXIC?
YOU'RE HANGING OUT WITH A KID.

52:37.323 --> 52:39.659
>> OH MY GOD.
IT'S NOT LIKE WE HOOK UP.
>> WELL, DUDE, HOW ARE WE

52:39.659 --> 52:42.095
SUPPOSED TO KNOW?
IT'S A WEIRD MESSAGE COMING
ACROSS.

52:42.095 --> 52:44.197
>> HOW DID YOU GUYS MEET?
>> WE ARE ON THE SAME SOCCER
TEAM.

52:44.197 --> 52:46.800
>> THE DRAGONS.
>> THE DRAGONS?
>> HANGING WITH THE WHOLE TEAM

52:46.800 --> 52:48.835

53:12.125 --> 53:15.128
>> HE IS.
IT'S JUST HIS DELIVERY OR
SOMETHING.

53:15.128 --> 53:17.063
HE JUST HAS IT.

LANGDON LEE ALONGSIDE
CHERYL WORTH.
>> LOTS AHEAD IN THE 9:00 HOUR,

58:40.120 --> 58:44.824
BUT FIRST, OUR MAN ABOUT TOWN,
SCOTT COTT, IS WITH A LOCAL
AUTHOR WHO'S WRITTEN A NEW

58:44.824 --> 58:49.062
SELF-HELP BOOK ABOUT FINDING
HAPPINESS THROUGH
SELF-DISCOVERY.

58:49.062 --> 58:52.232
HMM, SOUNDS INTERESTING.
>> YEAH, SURE DOES.
SCOTT'S DOWN AT A BOOK SIGNING

58:52.232 --> 58:57.504
AT BERGMAN'S BOOKS WITH
DR. BENJAMIN BLOOM, AUTHOR OF
"BLOWING YOURSELF."

58:57.504 --> 59:03.309
SCOTT?
>> THANKS, LANGDON.
I AM STANDING NEXT TO A MAN WHO

59:03.309 --> 59:10.717
HOPES TO HELP MILLIONS OF FOLKS
FIND HAPPINESS THROUGH
SELF-EXPLORATION.

59:10.717 --> 59:16.022
>> SCOTT, I HAVE TO JUMP IN.
I MISSPOKE BEFORE, DR. BLOOM'S
BOOK IS TITLED "KNOWING

59:16.022 --> 59:20.226
YOURSELF," NOT "BLOWING
YOURSELF."
THERE WERE A LOT OF "B" WORDS IN

59:20.226 --> 59:23.396
A ROW ON THE TELEPROMPTER AND I
GOT A LITTLE TONGUE-TIED.
SORRY ABOUT THAT, SCOTT.

59:23.396 --> 59:29.169
>> IT HAPPENS.
NOW DR. BLOOM, TELL US ABOUT
YOUR BOOK.

59:29.169 --> 59:35.041
>> WELL, IT'S A FEEL-GOOD BOOK.
IT'S ABOUT LEARNING HOW TO LOVE
YOURSELF BY GOING DOWN DEEP AND

59:35.041 --> 59:39.279
EMBRACING THE PART OF YOU THAT
YOU DISCOVER DOWN THERE.
>> WOW.

59:39.279 --> 59:45.085
THAT'S A LOT TO SWALLOW.
>> SORRY.
>> YES?

59:45.085 --> 59:49.756
>> SORRY, SCOTT.
I HAVE TO JUMP IN HERE.
WE'RE HAVING AN ISSUE WITH OUR

59:49.756 --> 59:55.862
GRAPHICS THAT'S MAKING THIS
INTERVIEW SEEM VERY APPROPRIATE.
THE BOOK IS "KNOWING YOURSELF."

59:55.862 --> 1:00:01.968
>> COME ON, GRAPHICS DEPARTMENT.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
GET IT TOGETHER.

1:00:01.968 --> 1:00:11.478

YOU.
>> THIS IS CINDY.
>> DO YOU PRACTICE IS TECHNIQUES

1:00:14.848 --> 1:00:19.853
IN YOUR HUSBAND'S BOOK?
>> YES, IT WAS A LITTLE HARDER
FOR ME TO GET THERE, THOUGH.

1:00:19.853 --> 1:00:26.726
I THINK WOMEN HAVE TO REACH
DEEPER IN THEMSELVES TO FIND
HAPPINESS?

1:00:26.726 --> 1:00:31.765
>> WOMEN ARE GENERALLY MORE
COMPLEX, A LOT MORE NOOKS AND
CRANNIES.

1:00:31.765 --> 1:00:37.103
>> IT CAN BE AN EMOTIONALLY
TAXING PROCESS.
IF YOU'RE LIKE ME, YOUR

1:00:37.103 --> 1:00:43.009
SENSITIVE SIDE IS GOING TO TAKE
A LICKING, BUT IN THE END, TRUST
ME, IT'S SO WORTH IT.

1:00:43.009 --> 1:00:46.112
BUY HIS BOOK.
I HAD MY NOSE BURIED IN IT FOR
HOURS.

1:00:46.112 --> 1:00:51.785

THANK YOU, CINDY.
>> DOCTOR, YOU'RE GOING TEACH ME

1:00:51.785 --> 1:00:56.022

HERE.
I TRIED YOGA ONCE AND I WAS

1:00:56.022 --> 1:01:00.660
AWFUL, SO HOPEFULLY I DON'T SUCK
HERE.
>> HEY, IT'S OKAY TO SUCK.

1:01:00.660 --> 1:01:04.564
IT'S HOW WE LEARN.
>> OKAY, GOOD.
WE'VE GOT SOME MATS HERE.

1:01:04.564 --> 1:01:08.068
>> LET'S GET DOWN.
>> GREAT.
>> YOU CAN DO THIS IN A CHAIR AT

1:01:08.068 --> 1:01:13.073
HOME ALSO.
>> OKAY.
>> OKAY.

1:01:13.073 --> 1:01:21.181
YOU WANT TO CENTER YOURSELF LIKE
SO.
>> OKAY.

1:01:21.181 --> 1:01:28.088
>> OKAY, BREATHE DEEPLY, REALLY
FILL YOUR MOUTH WITH LOTS --
>> NO.

1:01:28.088 --> 1:01:36.129
FOLKS, WE ARE SO DEEPLY SORRY.
THIS LOOKS VERY BAD.
MAYBE WE GO TO SPORTS?

1:01:36.129 --> 1:01:40.533
SPORTS, YEAH?
WANT TO GIVE PEOPLE YOUR SUPER
BOWL PREDICTIONS?

1:01:40.533 --> 1:01:47.107
>> NO, LET'S LET THIS PLAY OUT.
>> THANK YOU FOR NOTHING, NICK.
LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE WRAPPING UP.

1:01:47.107 --> 1:01:49.642
BRING THE AUDIO BACK.
>> OH.
WOW, I HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO.

1:01:49.642 --> 1:01:57.951
I GOT TO GET PRACTICING.
>> WELL, DON'T GO NUTS WHEN
YOU'RE JUST STARTING OUT.

1:01:57.951 --> 1:02:01.354
THAT WOULD BE GOING TOO FAR.
>> OKAY.
>>BUT WITH TIME, I PROMISE,

1:02:01.354 --> 1:02:05.925
YOU'LL RISE TO THE OCCASION AND
MEET YOURSELF HALFWAY.
>> YES!

1:02:05.925 --> 1:02:12.065
WELL SAID.
AND YOU'VE CERTAINLY MADE SOME
FANS OUT OF OUR VIEWERS.

1:02:12.065 --> 1:02:16.169

1:02:24.144 --> 1:02:28.114
AND AT NOON, I'LL BE
DEMONSTRATING MY TECHNIQUE LIVE.

CAN MAKE A RESERVATION ONLINE AT
WWW -- ACTUALLY, THEY'RE TELLING

1:02:35.755 --> 1:02:40.794

BACK TO YOU GUYS.
>> THOSE PEOPLE WHO MADE A
RESERVATION ARE GOING TO BE VERY

1:02:45.298 --> 1:02:49.736
DISAPPOINTED.
>> ALL RIGHT, COMING UP IN

1:03:24.671 --> 1:03:29.109
NOTHING WE CAN DO.
I DID ASK THE NEW TEMP TO ORDER
PIZZA.

I HOPE 22 BIGGIES ARE ENOUGH.
>>SEEMS LIKE TOO MANY, JEREMIAH.

1:03:37.250 --> 1:03:40.487

ARE REENTERING THE WORKFORCE AT
YOUR AGE.
