(mellow music playing)

01:08.500 --> 01:09.166
Oh!

01:18.500 --> 01:21.667
Blanche, why are you lining shelves
on a Friday night?

01:21.734 --> 01:24.767
I'm working off
all my excess sexual energy.

01:26.867 --> 01:30.066
Let's just hook you up
to the toaster and make pop-tarts.

01:32.133 --> 01:35.767
Don't make fun, Dorothy.
It's my fifth Friday night without a date.

01:35.834 --> 01:38.100
You're just in a little slump.

01:38.166 --> 01:39.667
Is that what this is?

01:40.000 --> 01:41.600
I've never been in one before.

01:42.834 --> 01:44.233
It feels like hell.

01:44.300 --> 01:47.467
Dorothy, how do you go through this
for years at a stretch?

01:50.100 --> 01:53.500
-I have compassionate friends around me.
-Oh.

01:54.200 --> 01:57.300
I guess eventually,
this was bound to happen.

01:57.367 --> 02:00.767
I can feel my femininity
slipping through my fingers.

02:00.834 --> 02:03.400
In the past, there's always been
a man there to catch it.

02:03.467 --> 02:07.066
Blanche, you're being ridiculous.

02:07.133 --> 02:11.166
You're as attractive
and desirable as you always were.

02:11.567 --> 02:13.533
A lot of men can be frightened by that.

02:13.600 --> 02:17.033
They're not sure
they can handle that much woman.

02:17.100 --> 02:19.934
Every once in a while, this will happen.

02:20.000 --> 02:20.767
You know, Blanche,

02:20.834 --> 02:25.700
it takes a strong, confident,
sophisticated man to appreciate you,

02:26.133 --> 02:31.233
but, honey, they're out there,
wanting you as much as you want them.

02:35.266 --> 02:36.767
I knew it was something like that.

02:36.834 --> 02:38.200
Thank you, Dorothy.

02:40.567 --> 02:42.600
There really is one born every minute.

02:47.033 --> 02:49.667
(chuckles)
Thanks for seeing us home, Miles.

02:49.734 --> 02:50.934
My pleasure.

02:51.033 --> 02:52.333
Well, hello there.

02:52.400 --> 02:54.166
Oh, you have company.

02:54.233 --> 02:56.867
Dorothy, Blanche, meet Miles Webber.

02:57.200 --> 02:59.767
-Hello, Miles. Nice to meet you.
-Thank you.

02:59.834 --> 03:00.934
A real delight.

03:04.333 --> 03:06.934
Miles is my dancing partner
at the ballroom.

03:07.000 --> 03:10.333
Tonight,
we were the king and queen of the rumba.

03:10.400 --> 03:11.066
(giggles)

03:11.133 --> 03:12.033
Ole.

03:15.934 --> 03:17.533
Ma, did you have a good time?

03:17.600 --> 03:18.333
Great.

03:18.400 --> 03:19.967
I even made a few bucks.

03:22.700 --> 03:24.600
How did you do that?

03:24.667 --> 03:29.000
The place was packed with old geezers.
I charged them 10 cents a dance.

03:30.667 --> 03:32.467
Ma, you didn't!

03:32.533 --> 03:34.633
I worked hard for that money.

03:34.700 --> 03:36.734
They kept falling asleep
in the middle of a song.

03:38.967 --> 03:42.433
Would you like to hold Mr. Morelli up
for two choruses of jeepers creepers?

03:44.300 --> 03:46.834
Ma, you did all that for 10 cents?

03:46.900 --> 03:51.100
It's worth a buck,
but these guys survived the depression.

03:51.166 --> 03:54.967
For $1.00, they expect a good time,
a shoeshine, and a tank of gas.

03:57.066 --> 03:58.900
(coins rattle)

04:02.367 --> 04:05.433
Rose, I'm having a get-together
at my place tomorrow night.

04:05.500 --> 04:07.066
An associate is retiring.

04:07.133 --> 04:08.467
Would you come?

04:09.100 --> 04:10.533
Why, I'd love it.

04:10.600 --> 04:11.900
-Around 8:00 then?
-Mm-hm.

04:11.967 --> 04:12.633
Good.

04:13.200 --> 04:15.333
-Well, good night, ladies.
-Nice meeting you, Miles.

04:15.400 --> 04:16.700
Come back and see us.

04:18.066 --> 04:19.834
-Good night, Rose.
-Good night.

04:23.333 --> 04:26.066
Oh, as they say in St. Olaf,

04:26.133 --> 04:29.700
<i>"Helderbargen vara</i>
<i>gerflufen frysa brud."</i>

04:32.367 --> 04:34.533
You want to help us out here, Rose?

04:35.800 --> 04:39.400
There's really no English word
for gerflufen.

04:40.700 --> 04:41.867
Loosely translated,

04:41.934 --> 04:45.133
it means I hope you have a license
to carry that <i>gerflufen.</i>

04:45.200 --> 04:45.867
(chuckles)

04:51.834 --> 04:55.567
This is a quality
that you look for in a man?

04:55.633 --> 04:56.600
Yes.

04:57.200 --> 05:00.767
Maybe I'm crazy to be so attracted
by someone I hardly know.

05:00.834 --> 05:01.934
I can't help it.

05:02.000 --> 05:07.066
I've been wanting him to ask me out,
but we never really talk.

05:07.133 --> 05:08.100
We just dance.

05:08.166 --> 05:09.834
What do you know about him?

05:09.900 --> 05:12.900
Nothing, except he's a wonderful dancer.

05:12.967 --> 05:14.333
What's that?

05:14.400 --> 05:16.166
All that proves is he has rhythm.

05:22.633 --> 05:23.934
I see what you mean.

05:26.133 --> 05:30.533
You can learn a lot about a man
by the way he holds you,

05:31.133 --> 05:35.400
whether he's kind, sensitive, caring.

05:35.967 --> 05:37.633
He dipped you, didn't he?

05:40.066 --> 05:41.467
All evening.

05:42.467 --> 05:44.000
Oh, Lord.

05:44.834 --> 05:46.834
It's so long since I've been dipped.

05:50.667 --> 05:53.967
I can't even remember
which end of a <i>gerflufen</i> is up.

05:57.500 --> 06:00.500
(mellow music playing)

06:03.667 --> 06:05.200
(doorbell rings)

06:11.767 --> 06:15.333
Rose, come on in.
You're missing all the fun.

06:15.400 --> 06:16.333
(laughs)

06:16.667 --> 06:20.633
I'll bet you probably thought a party full
of college professors would be stuffy,

06:20.700 --> 06:21.967
but not this one.

06:22.033 --> 06:23.900
You're a college professor?

06:23.967 --> 06:26.500
What did you think
"I taught Hemingway" meant?

06:26.567 --> 06:28.166
I thought you were old.

06:34.166 --> 06:36.400
Come on. I want you to meet some people.

06:36.467 --> 06:38.800
Gale, Lillian, this is my friend Rose.

06:38.867 --> 06:40.533
-How do you do?
-Hello.

06:40.600 --> 06:43.066
Miles, we were hypothesizing.

06:43.133 --> 06:47.266
If you could invite any two people,
living or dead, to dinner,

06:47.333 --> 06:48.133
who would they be?

06:48.200 --> 06:51.000
Lillian picked Winston Churchill
and Browning...

06:51.333 --> 06:52.600
without his wife.

06:52.667 --> 06:55.800
(laughs)

06:58.867 --> 07:00.967
Rose, whom would you pick?

07:01.600 --> 07:02.667
Just two?

07:02.734 --> 07:04.100
That's tough.

07:04.166 --> 07:05.300
Well, I'd feel guilty

07:05.367 --> 07:08.166
if I didn't invite my two best friends
Dorothy and Blanche.

07:08.667 --> 07:12.233
Would it be okay
if Jesus stopped by for dessert?

07:15.266 --> 07:18.133
(laughs)

07:18.200 --> 07:20.233
Didn't I tell you
she was something special?

07:20.300 --> 07:20.967
(laughs)

07:21.467 --> 07:23.767
Would you like something to drink?

07:23.834 --> 07:24.867
Ginger ale, if you have it.

07:24.934 --> 07:29.433
All right, but first I want
to introduce you to two close friends.

07:29.500 --> 07:32.133
Harv, Elise, meet Rose.

07:32.467 --> 07:33.767
Take good care of her.

07:34.200 --> 07:35.066
Hello.

07:35.133 --> 07:37.367
We were just having a little disagreement.

07:37.433 --> 07:41.400
Now, Harv, <i>Moby Dick</i>
is about self-fulfilling prophecy.

07:41.467 --> 07:42.667
Oh, come on, Elise.

07:42.734 --> 07:47.266
The whale represents
coming to terms with our self-hatred.

07:47.333 --> 07:48.934
-What do you think?
-Uh...

07:50.166 --> 07:53.967
I was just having a conversation
with two people over there,

07:54.700 --> 07:59.166
speculating on if you could have
any two people in the world,

07:59.233 --> 08:03.033
living or dead, to your house for dinner,
what would you eat?

08:09.533 --> 08:12.367
(quirky music playing)

08:20.533 --> 08:21.266
(exhales)

08:21.333 --> 08:24.200
I didn't know you went out.
Coming back from a date?

08:24.266 --> 08:26.734
Sometimes you can be so cruel.

08:28.967 --> 08:31.967
If no date, how come you're so dressed up?

08:32.033 --> 08:36.433
I sat down and tried to think
of a place to meet men.

08:36.500 --> 08:39.700
I couldn't believe
I hadn't thought of it before.

08:39.767 --> 08:41.533
The hardware store.

08:43.734 --> 08:47.767
Hardware stores are alive
with sexual energy.

08:48.300 --> 08:52.667
Tools, plugs, sockets,
nude furniture, dirty stuff.

08:54.033 --> 08:55.367
Why are you home so early?

08:55.433 --> 08:58.467
I saw a very attractive man
in power tools.

08:58.533 --> 09:02.033
I piqued his interest
with the usual hardware questions.

09:02.100 --> 09:03.333
Where does this go?

09:04.367 --> 09:05.700
What does this do?

09:08.200 --> 09:11.934
He followed me to plumbing.
I bought a see-through shower curtain.

09:12.600 --> 09:14.166
Where is he now?

09:14.233 --> 09:16.633
Tied to your roof rack?

09:21.867 --> 09:24.200
No, there was something about him
that turned me off.

09:24.767 --> 09:28.033
I think it was the way
he cleaned his ears with his keys.

09:33.233 --> 09:33.900
Hi.

09:33.967 --> 09:36.166
You're home early. Enjoy yourself?

09:36.233 --> 09:37.367
Not really.

09:37.867 --> 09:40.834
Miles' friends are all college professors.

09:41.533 --> 09:44.233
I don't get it.
When we're on the dance floor,

09:44.300 --> 09:46.166
it feels like we're made for each other,

09:46.800 --> 09:50.166
but tonight, with all
his brilliant friends at the party,

09:50.800 --> 09:52.533
I felt like a fish out of water.

09:53.166 --> 09:56.900
Sure, I didn't flop around on the floor
with my eyes bulging out,

09:56.967 --> 09:58.533
gasping for air.

09:59.934 --> 10:02.567
I haven't done that at a party in years.

10:06.333 --> 10:09.500
Honey,
anybody would feel out of her league

10:09.567 --> 10:12.033
in a room full of college professors.

10:12.100 --> 10:15.533
You should have a home field advantage.
Invite him over here.

10:15.600 --> 10:16.834
Dorothy's right.

10:16.900 --> 10:19.467
We can create the illusion
that you're interesting.

10:21.767 --> 10:24.633
That's quite an illusion.
Let's just saw her in half.

10:26.967 --> 10:29.967
(mellow music playing)

10:32.433 --> 10:34.200
Excuse me. I'll get the coffee.

10:34.667 --> 10:36.934
Dinner was delicious. What was it?

10:37.000 --> 10:40.500
It's a Scandinavian specialty,
kaldolmar.

10:40.567 --> 10:43.633
I never heard of that, but it's marvelous.

10:43.700 --> 10:46.900
You just throw together
ground pork and cabbage.

10:46.967 --> 10:49.967
Cabbage.
In 10 minutes, I could be skywriting.

11:03.600 --> 11:06.800
You were right about getting Miles
on my turf.

11:06.867 --> 11:11.133
I'm grateful for you steering
the table talk to things I know about.

11:11.200 --> 11:12.400
You ought to be.

11:12.467 --> 11:16.500
It wasn't easy working natural fertilizer
into the dinner conversation.

11:18.867 --> 11:20.467
What are you planning next?

11:20.533 --> 11:24.200
Do you think it's too soon
to put on the bloopers tape?

11:27.066 --> 11:28.166
Just a tad.

11:30.100 --> 11:34.066
So, the existentialist says
to the psychiatrist,

11:34.133 --> 11:36.900
"Just because you don't see
a parrot on my head..."

11:36.967 --> 11:39.600
-(laughs)
-See?

11:39.667 --> 11:42.734
(laughing)

11:42.800 --> 11:45.433
Oh, Rose, I was wondering.

11:45.500 --> 11:49.433
If you're not busy Saturday afternoon,
the university is playing Shostakovich.

11:49.500 --> 11:52.734
Oh, I'd love to go,
and I'll bet we beat them.

11:57.200 --> 12:01.333
Rose, honey, it's not a team.
It's a composer.

12:02.000 --> 12:02.667
Oh.

12:03.900 --> 12:05.233
I better get the dessert.

12:10.066 --> 12:11.800
She sure left in a hurry.

12:11.867 --> 12:13.800
Hey, who told her to feed me cabbage?

12:24.533 --> 12:27.066
I thought I'd help you with the dessert.

12:29.300 --> 12:30.467
What's wrong, Rose?

12:32.200 --> 12:34.834
"It's not a team, Rose. It's a composer."

12:34.900 --> 12:38.133
Couldn't you pretend it was a team
and make him look stupid?

12:41.333 --> 12:42.900
Honey, I'm sorry.

12:42.967 --> 12:44.600
I'm not going back.

12:44.667 --> 12:45.700
He'll never miss me.

12:45.767 --> 12:49.200
Rose, you're the one he came to see.

12:49.266 --> 12:51.066
But he can talk to you.

12:51.133 --> 12:53.467
Why should he care
about what I'd have to say?

12:54.433 --> 12:56.700
I'm just not smart enough to keep up.

12:56.767 --> 12:59.767
-Rose, that is not true.
-It's true.

13:00.300 --> 13:02.700
I've never felt like this before.

13:03.433 --> 13:06.633
I was one of the smartest people
in St. Olaf.

13:09.467 --> 13:12.166
I was a fool
to think we could have a relationship.

13:12.600 --> 13:15.133
Please apologize for me.

13:15.200 --> 13:18.000
I'd do it, but it would just sound stupid.

13:20.133 --> 13:23.166
(somber music playing)

13:29.400 --> 13:31.967
(mellow music playing)

13:32.734 --> 13:34.233
Fine, I will tell her.

13:34.934 --> 13:35.967
Bye-bye.

13:37.066 --> 13:37.900
Hi.

13:37.967 --> 13:39.233
Miles called.

13:39.300 --> 13:41.900
Wants you to meet him
outside the concert hall.

13:41.967 --> 13:43.667
Tell him I'm not going.

13:43.734 --> 13:46.100
I'm not going to do your dirty work.

13:46.166 --> 13:47.867
I don't want to talk to him.

13:48.533 --> 13:50.200
He makes me feel foolish.

13:50.667 --> 13:54.500
I can't even tell him St. Olaf stories.

13:57.166 --> 14:00.900
I want to know exactly what he said
to make you feel that way.

14:05.934 --> 14:07.667
I'm not going.

14:07.734 --> 14:08.567
You go, Blanche.

14:08.633 --> 14:11.700
-What?
-You like him. I know you do.

14:11.767 --> 14:12.700
You go.

14:12.767 --> 14:14.400
I couldn't.

14:14.467 --> 14:15.834
Of course, she couldn't.

14:16.300 --> 14:17.767
You stay out of this, Dorothy.

14:19.967 --> 14:22.266
Well, why not? It's all over between us.

14:22.333 --> 14:23.633
He'll know that tonight.

14:23.700 --> 14:25.300
It's impossible.

14:25.367 --> 14:27.300
I'd feel like a...

14:27.800 --> 14:29.066
I'd feel like a...

14:29.667 --> 14:31.834
A back-stabbing slut?

14:37.567 --> 14:38.300
No.

14:39.700 --> 14:42.033
Then please, go for me.

14:42.100 --> 14:45.166
I'll feel better
knowing this thing is finally over with.

14:46.200 --> 14:48.333
Well, since you put it that way...

14:48.734 --> 14:51.100
But only as a personal favor to you.

14:52.400 --> 14:54.000
I guess I'd better get dressed.

14:54.066 --> 14:55.600
Thank you, Blanche.

14:58.100 --> 15:00.633
Can you believe that back-stabbing slut?

15:04.767 --> 15:07.800
(light music playing)

15:14.533 --> 15:16.467
Ma, are you going to the ballroom again?

15:16.533 --> 15:18.867
No.
I'm thinking of wearing this when I die.

15:18.934 --> 15:19.967
What do you think?

15:22.233 --> 15:23.767
Why aren't you ready?

15:23.834 --> 15:24.767
I'm not going.

15:24.834 --> 15:25.934
How come?

15:26.000 --> 15:28.500
Well, Miles might be there.

15:28.567 --> 15:31.467
Don't say you're going to feel stupid.

15:31.533 --> 15:32.700
You are not stupid.

15:32.767 --> 15:33.800
You just...

15:36.734 --> 15:38.633
march to a different drummer?

15:38.700 --> 15:41.967
Yeah, the little wind-up monkey
banging on the snare drum.

15:42.033 --> 15:42.900
Ma.

15:43.433 --> 15:45.066
I was agreeing!

15:46.967 --> 15:48.467
Blanche, how was the concert?

15:48.533 --> 15:52.400
It is amazing how music that loud
can be so boring.

15:53.300 --> 15:54.367
And Miles?

15:54.433 --> 15:56.467
Even more boring than the music.

15:56.533 --> 16:01.700
All he did was talk about you,
how sweet and attractive Rose is.

16:01.767 --> 16:03.800
How much fun Rose is.

16:03.867 --> 16:05.867
I might as well have worn a bra.

16:12.233 --> 16:14.934
Did he really say that?
You're not just making that up?

16:15.000 --> 16:17.867
I never make up stories
where I come out looking bad.

16:19.200 --> 16:23.300
He's going to the ballroom tonight,
and he hopes you'll be there.

16:23.734 --> 16:24.867
Oh, I couldn't.

16:24.934 --> 16:27.400
I want to but I can't.

16:27.467 --> 16:28.700
Why not?

16:28.767 --> 16:32.500
What if we're dancing
and I say something idiotic?

16:32.567 --> 16:34.066
Just breathe it in his ear.

16:35.033 --> 16:37.333
Nothing sounds idiotic if it's wet enough.

16:42.667 --> 16:44.734
Will you come with me?

16:44.800 --> 16:46.500
Not tonight.

16:46.567 --> 16:49.734
I want to curl up with a good book.

16:49.800 --> 16:51.567
That's all you ever do.

16:51.633 --> 16:52.900
No, it isn't.

16:52.967 --> 16:56.033
Yes, it is. That's all you've done.

16:56.100 --> 16:57.200
It's pathetic.

16:57.600 --> 17:00.567
What's even more pathetic
is that I've been home to watch.

17:03.300 --> 17:05.066
Dorothy, I really need you there.

17:05.133 --> 17:08.433
I need your shoulder,
in case he takes his away.

17:09.200 --> 17:11.433
Oh, all right. I'll go.

17:11.500 --> 17:13.600
Ma, where are my dancing shoes?

17:13.667 --> 17:16.266
In the Smithsonian,
right next to Fred Astaire's.

17:18.233 --> 17:19.700
How the hell would I know?

17:22.100 --> 17:23.767
Blanche, you coming with us?

17:24.133 --> 17:25.967
You're kidding, of course.

17:26.033 --> 17:26.800
Oh, you'll love it.

17:26.867 --> 17:31.900
Nothing personal, honey,
but those places are meant for desperate,

17:31.967 --> 17:35.533
hopeless people
who can't find someone any other way.

17:36.166 --> 17:37.533
Well, if you're sure...

17:40.133 --> 17:42.433
I'd rather be tied to a tree
covered in honey

17:42.500 --> 17:44.800
and have grizzlies lick it off.

17:51.500 --> 17:53.433
Why do I torture myself like this?

17:53.500 --> 17:55.100
Girls, wait for me.

17:56.633 --> 17:59.633
("Serenade In Blue" playing)

18:08.500 --> 18:13.533
Ma, this... this place is fantastic.
I feel like I did when I was 20.

18:13.600 --> 18:15.333
You mean unmarried and pregnant?

18:18.333 --> 18:21.000
Blanche, look around.
Isn't this wonderful?

18:21.066 --> 18:23.667
Aren't you suddenly the life of the party?

18:23.734 --> 18:25.600
This place gives me the creeps.

18:25.667 --> 18:28.567
See how much fun everybody's having.

18:28.633 --> 18:32.066
Wait till they hear Glenn Miller's dead.

18:32.133 --> 18:33.967
He's not dead. He's missing.

18:37.133 --> 18:38.800
Stop complaining, Blanche.

18:38.867 --> 18:42.033
Look at all the available men.

18:42.100 --> 18:46.567
This is going to be like fishing
in one of those trout farms.

18:50.467 --> 18:52.734
May I have this dance, Sophia?

18:53.367 --> 18:55.667
I got the time if you got the dime.

18:55.734 --> 18:56.600
(coins rattle)

18:58.200 --> 18:59.567
I'm all yours.

19:02.567 --> 19:04.700
I don't see Miles here anywhere.

19:05.300 --> 19:06.700
Maybe he didn't come.

19:06.767 --> 19:08.433
He almost didn't.

19:08.500 --> 19:09.567
(chuckles)
Hi, Dorothy.

19:09.633 --> 19:10.567
(Dorothy) Hello, Miles.

19:10.633 --> 19:13.500
You left my party,
you disappear at dinner,

19:13.567 --> 19:16.333
you send Blanche to the concert...

19:16.400 --> 19:18.333
I was beginning to take it personally.

19:18.934 --> 19:19.600
Shall we?

19:20.033 --> 19:21.033
Go on, Rose.

19:22.033 --> 19:23.066
Excuse us, Dorothy.

19:24.000 --> 19:26.567
I'm going to keep one arm
around your waist

19:26.633 --> 19:28.333
to make sure you don't disappear again.

19:30.100 --> 19:33.900
Dorothy, this is Alfred.

19:33.967 --> 19:36.600
He's an ear, nose, and throat specialist.

19:37.200 --> 19:40.200
He says he's been looking for love
in all the wrong places.

19:47.834 --> 19:50.133
I was happy to see you here tonight.

19:50.767 --> 19:53.033
I was starting to wonder
how you felt about me.

19:54.133 --> 19:56.200
Is there something wrong?

19:56.266 --> 19:57.567
You've hardly said a word.

19:59.300 --> 20:00.000
Ah...

20:00.700 --> 20:02.066
I'm glad to hear it.

20:03.667 --> 20:05.367
Care to dance?

20:05.433 --> 20:07.633
Oh, I don't think so.

20:07.700 --> 20:10.333
I'm usually not this forward,

20:10.400 --> 20:12.600
but Glenn Miller has an effect on me.

20:13.300 --> 20:14.767
You don't like Glenn Miller?

20:14.834 --> 20:18.300
Are you kidding?
I was in the search party.

20:18.367 --> 20:19.700
Let's dance.

20:24.533 --> 20:27.000
Oh, listen to that music.

20:27.400 --> 20:28.233
(chuckles)

20:28.300 --> 20:30.533
Who says you can't go home again?

20:31.533 --> 20:33.066
Knut Trollstead.

20:33.533 --> 20:36.433
You see, he took Ilse Frickadeller up
to smooch point

20:36.500 --> 20:38.100
to play hide the fingerborg.

20:39.734 --> 20:41.033
That's a thimble.

20:41.467 --> 20:43.800
Well, Ilse sat on his compass,

20:43.867 --> 20:46.900
and they got so lost
they walked to Finland.

20:46.967 --> 20:50.533
And that's when Knut said,
"You can't go home again."

20:51.700 --> 20:54.133
-Well, that's very, uh...
-Stupid!

20:55.800 --> 20:56.533
Rose?

20:58.066 --> 20:59.066
Rose!

21:01.066 --> 21:04.500
-Is something wrong?
-I don't know what you see in me.

21:04.567 --> 21:05.567
I see you.

21:06.166 --> 21:07.734
Why me?

21:07.800 --> 21:09.700
I thought you'd like Blanche.

21:09.767 --> 21:11.633
I like Blanche very much.

21:11.700 --> 21:12.967
So does Blanche.

21:15.033 --> 21:16.200
(laughs)

21:16.266 --> 21:17.600
That's better.

21:18.700 --> 21:20.767
I feel so dumb around you.

21:20.834 --> 21:22.567
Never say that, Rose.

21:22.633 --> 21:26.734
But you're a teacher.
You think for a living.

21:26.800 --> 21:27.600
(sighs)

21:29.667 --> 21:32.166
Don't be so impressed. I have summers off.

21:34.266 --> 21:36.200
I don't know how you can stand
listening to me

21:36.266 --> 21:38.834
and all my ridiculous stories.

21:39.533 --> 21:42.133
Your stories are very refreshing, Rose.

21:43.300 --> 21:46.633
It's like driving in the country
and getting lost.

21:47.066 --> 21:48.600
You may not know where you are,

21:48.667 --> 21:52.333
but you always have a good time
finding your way out.

21:54.834 --> 21:56.667
That was a compliment, wasn't it?

21:58.100 --> 21:58.967
Come on.

22:08.633 --> 22:10.166
I like you very much, Rose.

22:10.767 --> 22:13.800
You know, you're... you're very special.

22:14.333 --> 22:16.533
I'm just lucky
to be smart enough to see it.

22:19.300 --> 22:23.600
You know, life's a ballroom, Rose,
if you'll pardon the metaphor.

22:24.333 --> 22:27.400
If you hear something you like,
don't analyze it, just...

22:28.834 --> 22:30.467
Just dance to it.

22:31.367 --> 22:32.300
Do you understand?

22:33.333 --> 22:34.367
I think so...

22:35.900 --> 22:38.033
Except what a metaphor is.

22:39.266 --> 22:40.667
Who needs metaphors?

22:40.734 --> 22:41.934
Come on. Let's dance.

22:43.934 --> 22:46.934
(romantic music playing)

23:11.934 --> 23:14.934
(closing theme music playing)
