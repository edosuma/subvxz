WEBVTT

00:01.130 --> 00:02.130
Hey, thank you.

00:03.140 --> 00:04.200
Here's an Andrew Jackson.

00:04.200 --> 00:05.630
Make a clean set
of sheets happen,

00:05.640 --> 00:07.280
I'll introduce you
to his twin brother.

00:07.280 --> 00:08.800
(chuckles)

00:08.810 --> 00:11.210
You don't have to do the banter,
but what's it cost me?

00:11.210 --> 00:13.370
Manny, it was a great idea
to come on the train.

00:13.380 --> 00:15.450
Rail is the last bastion
of respectable travel

00:15.450 --> 00:17.990
now that every airport has
become a sweat-pant convention.

00:17.990 --> 00:20.050
We are all traveling to Portland

00:20.050 --> 00:23.050
because Jay's ex-wife, Dede,
is getting remarried.

00:23.060 --> 00:25.460
We're so happy.
For us.

00:25.460 --> 00:27.490
It means the end of those
damn alimony payments,

00:27.490 --> 00:29.490
so I'm gonna make sure
Dede goes through with it.

00:29.500 --> 00:33.470
It'll be, "I do," "I do,"
"I'm done."

00:33.470 --> 00:34.800
(bell dinging)

00:34.800 --> 00:35.890
How much choice action

00:35.900 --> 00:37.160
are we gonna get on this trip?

00:37.170 --> 00:39.070
I'm managing my expectations.

00:39.070 --> 00:41.170
Don't you know anything
about trains?

00:41.170 --> 00:42.470
Chicks go crazy.

00:42.480 --> 00:44.710
The vibrations
get them all worked up.

00:44.710 --> 00:46.870
Also, they're trapped,
which is nice.

00:46.880 --> 00:48.880
Hey.
We're just gonna
go bang out

00:48.880 --> 00:50.910
this toast for Mom.
Yeah. Shouldn't have waited
till the last minute.

00:50.920 --> 00:53.090
It'll be a nice distraction
from your motion sickness.

00:53.090 --> 00:54.920
It's good, as long
as I'm not facing backwards

00:54.920 --> 00:57.250
when the train is...
Oh, God, no.

00:57.260 --> 00:58.490
Lead me.

00:58.490 --> 01:00.320
All right, I got it.

01:00.330 --> 01:01.650
There you go. Fixed point.
Mm-hmm.

01:10.500 --> 01:13.400
♪♪

01:14.870 --> 01:17.000
Oh, my God, it can't be.

01:17.010 --> 01:18.450
What? No, it's not
a bald spot.

01:18.450 --> 01:19.950
I slept on it funny last night.

01:19.950 --> 01:22.620
No. The guy two rows back.

01:22.620 --> 01:24.050
Oh, my...
That's Simon Ha...

01:24.050 --> 01:25.250
Hastings.
Oh, my...

01:25.250 --> 01:26.880
You're a fan of his, too?

01:26.890 --> 01:28.420
Oh, my... He's my favorite
author. Don't tell Mitchell,

01:28.420 --> 01:29.880
but I was so engrossed
in his last book,

01:29.890 --> 01:31.960
I didn't feed Lily
for a day and a half.

01:33.690 --> 01:34.890
Wait a second.

01:34.890 --> 01:38.060
Simon Hastings
is the genius behind

01:38.060 --> 01:39.560
the Silverton mystery novels.

01:39.570 --> 01:40.540
<i>"Dismembers Only."</i>

01:40.540 --> 01:41.630
<i>"A Death of Fresh Air."</i>

01:41.640 --> 01:42.900
The world has been waiting

01:42.900 --> 01:44.300
for the final book
of the trilogy

01:44.300 --> 01:45.930
for almost, what, 10 years?

01:45.940 --> 01:48.210
I missed it so much, I took
a stab at writing fan fiction.

01:48.210 --> 01:49.710
What?

01:49.710 --> 01:51.550
I put Silverton in the harrowing
world of real estate

01:51.550 --> 01:53.470
with
<i>"Open House, Closed Casket."</i>

01:53.480 --> 01:55.120
(gasps)

01:55.120 --> 01:56.220
Goose bumps.

02:00.050 --> 02:01.650
Hey!
Hey!

02:01.660 --> 02:04.730
We hate to bother you,
but you are our favorite author.

02:04.730 --> 02:06.990
Gentlemen,
the words are all out there.

02:06.990 --> 02:09.889
I just arrange them in
a financially rewarding way.

02:09.900 --> 02:13.470
(laughs) Droll is what
that is. Droll.
Classic Hastings.

02:13.470 --> 02:15.140
That by any chance isn't the...

02:15.140 --> 02:16.570
The next Silverton novel, is it?

02:16.570 --> 02:18.340
You mean
<i>"Locomotive for Murder"?</i>

02:18.340 --> 02:19.910
Crackerjack.

02:19.910 --> 02:21.580
It's not even out yet,
and I'm sad about finishing it.

02:21.580 --> 02:23.500
Well, I hope you won't be
disappointed.

02:23.510 --> 02:24.650
Lovely to meet you.

02:28.350 --> 02:29.780
What's your process?

02:29.780 --> 02:31.810
Are the characters
just speaking through you?

02:31.820 --> 02:33.190
How important is plot?

02:33.190 --> 02:35.460
Here's an idea...
How would you two like

02:35.460 --> 02:37.790
to sit quietly
and read the first chapter?

02:37.790 --> 02:38.750
Oh...
What?

02:38.760 --> 02:40.490
My...
What?

02:40.490 --> 02:41.790
God.
What?

02:41.800 --> 02:43.360
(laughs)
Rest assured.

02:43.360 --> 02:45.260
Your treasure is in good hands.

02:45.270 --> 02:47.500
We are also members
of the artistic community.

02:47.500 --> 02:49.200
Clown.
Magician.

02:49.200 --> 02:50.500
(chuckles)

02:50.500 --> 02:52.930
Ugh.

02:52.940 --> 02:54.470
Nope.

02:54.470 --> 02:56.000
What?
We're on a train,

02:56.010 --> 02:57.650
and I'm embracing
a romantic style of travel.

02:57.650 --> 02:59.200
I get it, and I love it.

02:59.210 --> 03:00.870
Wonderful Victorian tea hat.

03:00.880 --> 03:02.820
Thank you.
Top-notch travel derby.

03:02.820 --> 03:05.390
Ma'am.
See you at high tea.

03:05.390 --> 03:08.220
He acts like someone
with low "T."
Ah.

03:08.220 --> 03:10.850
Ugh, I forgot my magazines
when I was buying gum.

03:10.860 --> 03:12.530
Oh, it's hard to do
two things at once.

03:12.530 --> 03:13.830
(sighs)
You got an extra book?

03:13.830 --> 03:15.160
Well, I'm re-reading
<i>"Jane Eyre,"</i>

03:15.160 --> 03:16.520
but I've got <i> "Anna Karenina"</i>
on deck.

03:16.530 --> 03:18.370
What you got?

03:18.370 --> 03:20.240
<i>"Hurricane Harriet."</i>
It's mostly pictures.

03:20.240 --> 03:22.530
Sold. Move over.

03:22.540 --> 03:24.740
So, what's Harriet's deal?

03:24.740 --> 03:27.310
She's a ditzy girl who causes
problems for everyone,

03:27.310 --> 03:28.580
but never realizes it.

03:28.580 --> 03:30.410
Doesn't sound very realistic.

03:33.180 --> 03:35.150
Ah, do you guys know
where the bathroom is?

03:35.150 --> 03:36.550
Oh, back there.

03:36.550 --> 03:38.080
Isn't it that way?

03:38.080 --> 03:39.680
Doesn't matter.

03:39.690 --> 03:43.090
(indistinct conversations)

03:43.090 --> 03:44.760
First-class ticket,
please.

03:44.760 --> 03:46.190
I just came
looking for the bathroom.

03:46.190 --> 03:47.820
My ticket is in my seat.

03:47.830 --> 03:49.060
Do you have any idea how many
times a day I hear that?

03:49.060 --> 03:50.860
Just go back
where you came from.

03:50.860 --> 03:52.390
Go back where I came from?

03:52.400 --> 03:53.700
(chuckling)
Okay.

03:53.700 --> 03:55.240
I see how it is.

04:02.210 --> 04:03.910
(shouting in Spanish)

04:03.910 --> 04:05.910
So, Harriet
just sent those people

04:05.910 --> 04:07.240
right into a bear cave?

04:07.250 --> 04:08.720
She never knows
what she's doing.

04:08.720 --> 04:10.490
(laughs)
What an idiot.

04:14.290 --> 04:15.290
Excuse me.

04:16.790 --> 04:17.760
You mind if I sit here?

04:17.760 --> 04:19.589
Uh, no.
(chuckles)

04:22.100 --> 04:23.930
You have a beautiful smile.

04:23.930 --> 04:25.570
Thanks.
(chuckles)

04:25.570 --> 04:27.270
They make fun of you
for wearing your headgear,

04:27.270 --> 04:29.240
but, hey, look at me now.

04:29.240 --> 04:30.210
(both laugh)

04:30.210 --> 04:31.900
Tickets?
Oh, yeah.

04:31.910 --> 04:34.540
Uh, honey,
do you have my ticket?
No.

04:34.540 --> 04:36.540
I'm pretty sure I gave you
my ticket, babe.

04:36.540 --> 04:38.400
Sorry, babe.
Back to coach.

04:38.410 --> 04:41.270
I forgive you.
(chuckles)

04:43.420 --> 04:46.820
Come find me.

04:46.820 --> 04:49.260
(door opens)
(Gloria shouting in Spanish)

04:49.260 --> 04:51.830
"Mom has always been
a free spirit."

04:51.830 --> 04:55.460
"She has also helped to free
a lot of spirits from bottles

04:55.460 --> 04:57.960
'cause the woman's
a boozehound!" Hello!

04:57.960 --> 04:59.320
Yeah, I'm not gonna put that in.

04:59.330 --> 05:01.160
Uh, how about this one?
"The secret to her

05:01.170 --> 05:03.270
chocolate-chip cookies
was a dash of salt..."

05:03.270 --> 05:07.310
"And two scoops of crazy
because the lady's imbalanced."

05:07.310 --> 05:08.440
Hello!

05:08.440 --> 05:10.400
Claire, this is toast,
not a roast.

05:10.410 --> 05:13.150
Are you uncomfortable because,
for the first time in your life,

05:13.150 --> 05:15.650
you have to be
the straight man? Hello!

05:15.650 --> 05:18.090
Saying "hello" doesn't make
mean things funny.

05:18.090 --> 05:19.980
I like it.
Well, you don't get
to decide.

05:19.990 --> 05:21.190
How come you get to decide?

05:21.190 --> 05:22.660
'Cause Mom asked me and not you.

05:22.660 --> 05:24.160
I included you
because I felt bad.

05:24.160 --> 05:26.490
(sighs)

05:26.490 --> 05:28.520
That's fine.
I don't care.

05:28.530 --> 05:30.430
You can do it yourself.

05:30.430 --> 05:32.500
I don't care.
Claire.

05:32.500 --> 05:34.300
Wait.

05:34.300 --> 05:36.500
(stammers)
Nope.

05:36.500 --> 05:38.100
This is a $20.

05:38.100 --> 05:40.800
When my wife shows up later,
"iced tea" means Scotch.

05:40.810 --> 05:43.680
Grandpa, do you think it's weird

05:43.680 --> 05:45.210
Nana invited you to her wedding?

05:45.210 --> 05:47.540
I think it's the least-weird
thing Dede's ever done.

05:47.550 --> 05:49.480
Well, if she was so bad,
why'd you ever marry her?

05:49.480 --> 05:50.980
We were young.

05:50.980 --> 05:53.550
She was cute, but the constant
nuttiness of Dede

05:53.550 --> 05:56.050
wore me down,
robbed me of my will to live.

05:56.060 --> 05:58.190
One day, she pushed me
off the edge.

05:58.190 --> 05:59.820
I ran out of the house.

05:59.830 --> 06:01.800
They found me shirtless
in the local fire station.

06:01.800 --> 06:03.790
Excuse me.

06:03.800 --> 06:05.870
This, uh, Dede
that you're speaking of...

06:05.870 --> 06:07.500
Um, is that Dede Pritchett,
by chance?

06:07.500 --> 06:09.340
Do you know her?

06:09.340 --> 06:10.670
She's marrying my father.

06:10.670 --> 06:12.310
You're kidding.

06:12.310 --> 06:14.710
No. We're traveling
to the wedding right now...

06:14.710 --> 06:15.710
if there is one.

06:15.710 --> 06:17.480
I've got to call Dad.

06:17.480 --> 06:19.280
I told you
that woman was off.
Just ridiculous.

06:21.380 --> 06:23.580
I'm gonna need $18 back.

06:25.250 --> 06:27.850
Uh, excuse me.
Uh, hi, Mr. Hastings.

06:27.850 --> 06:30.350
Um, do you know... have
they developed a cure yet?

06:30.360 --> 06:32.230
For what?

06:32.230 --> 06:34.430
A blown mind...
because we have two of them.
(chuckles)

06:34.430 --> 06:37.070
You're too kind.
Oh, thank you.
Oh, thank you.

06:37.070 --> 06:39.560
We are just dying to know
how the conductor got

06:39.570 --> 06:41.900
all the way from the front to
the back, kill the ambassador,

06:41.900 --> 06:43.430
and not be seen?

06:43.440 --> 06:45.710
There's an escape hatch
in the control room.

06:45.710 --> 06:47.040
Oh.

06:47.040 --> 06:48.610
He climbs up,
crawls his way across

06:48.610 --> 06:50.880
the top of the train
to the caboose.

06:50.880 --> 06:54.250
There, his feet firmly planted,
thanks to magnetic shoes,

06:54.250 --> 06:57.220
he hangs down,
shoots the ambassador,

06:57.220 --> 06:59.250
then crawls back
the way he came.

06:59.250 --> 07:01.410
That is so ingenious.

07:01.420 --> 07:03.420
How does he avoid
the video cameras?
Yeah.

07:03.420 --> 07:05.850
I beg your pardon.
On top of the train.

07:05.860 --> 07:07.800
He's on a train
that doesn't have any cameras.

07:07.800 --> 07:10.460
Oh, no, they all have cameras
now... Big Brother.

07:10.460 --> 07:11.920
I just read an article
about it in <i> Rail World,</i>

07:11.930 --> 07:13.530
the magazine
in your seat pocket...

07:13.530 --> 07:14.560
Also a great interview
with amateur conductor

07:14.570 --> 07:16.270
Valerie Bertinelli.

07:16.270 --> 07:18.770
Well, if that's true,
then the murder isn't possible.

07:18.770 --> 07:20.630
And if the ambassador
is still alive,

07:20.640 --> 07:23.710
then there's no reason for
Silverton to be in Nigeria.

07:23.710 --> 07:26.750
And if that's the case,
he's not at the coup,

07:26.750 --> 07:29.480
which means the whole thing
doesn't work.

07:29.480 --> 07:31.810
Dear God, I have no book.

07:31.820 --> 07:35.120
Oh.

07:35.120 --> 07:38.120
I have no book!

07:38.120 --> 07:41.990
Now I wish I hadn't
circled the typos.

07:46.330 --> 07:47.890
What are you still doing here?
Go find him.

07:47.900 --> 07:49.400
(sighs)
I don't know.

07:49.400 --> 07:50.560
Come on, it's
a better love story

07:50.570 --> 07:51.940
than the one you're reading.

07:51.940 --> 07:54.480
You're the beautiful,
high-class, smart girl,

07:54.480 --> 07:56.570
and he's the poor boy
duct-taping his shoes

07:56.580 --> 07:58.180
with a bunch of hobos in coach.

07:58.180 --> 07:59.610
It's a $20 difference.

07:59.610 --> 08:01.140
Alex, you got this.

08:01.150 --> 08:02.950
Trains make guys crazy.

08:02.950 --> 08:04.290
When were you ever on a train?

08:04.290 --> 08:05.610
In Vegas,

08:05.620 --> 08:06.920
between my plane
and the luggage area.

08:06.920 --> 08:09.190
Stuff went down.
Fine. I'll go for it.

08:09.190 --> 08:10.090
Oh, wait.

08:10.090 --> 08:12.030
Nope.

08:15.660 --> 08:18.690
Manny likes hats, doesn't he?

08:18.700 --> 08:20.970
Ooh, someone's
still got a crush.

08:20.970 --> 08:22.200
I'm not proud of it.

08:22.200 --> 08:23.630
I tried to get past it.

08:23.640 --> 08:25.140
But, you know, trains.

08:25.140 --> 08:29.840
Well, I think you look cute,
and I bet he would, too.

08:29.840 --> 08:31.670
Hey, you pervs.

08:31.680 --> 08:33.549
Let me guess... shoulders tired
from striking out so hard?

08:33.549 --> 08:36.020
It's still early.

08:36.020 --> 08:37.990
Ooh, I see a dime piece
over there.

08:37.990 --> 08:39.140
That means she's a 10.

08:39.150 --> 08:40.350
Yeah. I speak d-bag.

08:40.350 --> 08:41.780
Luke, she's a little old.

08:41.789 --> 08:43.390
Hey, Jennifer Lopez is like 90.

08:43.390 --> 08:45.530
Doesn't mean I don't pretend
she's my pillow

08:45.530 --> 08:46.560
every now and then.

08:48.130 --> 08:49.630
How does he have prospects?

08:49.630 --> 08:50.830
If it makes you feel any better,

08:50.830 --> 08:52.370
that one's
got a big crush on you.

08:56.970 --> 08:58.510
Manny: I guess I shouldn't
have been surprised.

08:58.510 --> 09:00.500
I've always sensed
a little heat from Alex.

09:00.510 --> 09:02.510
A woman doesn't
compliment a man on his hat

09:02.510 --> 09:04.450
unless she wants
to get into his blazer.

09:06.380 --> 09:07.410
Hey.

09:07.410 --> 09:09.670
Peace offering?
Thank you.

09:09.680 --> 09:11.180
Look, I'm sorry I told you

09:11.180 --> 09:12.740
that Mom picked me
for the toast and not you.

09:12.750 --> 09:14.180
It's just that...
I've always had

09:14.190 --> 09:15.760
a special relationship with her.

09:15.760 --> 09:18.360
Sure, like the one between
a witch and her flying monkey.

09:18.360 --> 09:20.660
Don't do that. Don't use
<i>"The Wizard of Oz"</i> against m.

09:20.660 --> 09:21.860
Mom manipulates you.

09:21.860 --> 09:24.020
She uses you
against the rest of us.

09:24.030 --> 09:25.730
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

09:25.730 --> 09:27.760
Oh, God, if only I could
think of an example.

09:27.770 --> 09:29.400
Oh, wait, here's one of 30.

09:29.400 --> 09:31.760
She blew off Alex's graduation,
but she didn't tell us.

09:31.770 --> 09:35.530
She made you do it so we would
all dump on you instead of her.

09:35.540 --> 09:38.100
And now she bans me
from giving a toast,

09:38.110 --> 09:39.840
and we're fighting about it.

09:39.850 --> 09:41.850
Come on. She's using you
like a human shield.

09:41.850 --> 09:43.380
Does that seem like
a healthy relationship?

09:43.380 --> 09:44.740
(sighs)

09:44.750 --> 09:45.910
Why don't you give that
some thought

09:45.920 --> 09:47.020
while you're getting me
a refill?

09:47.020 --> 09:48.360
When did you even drink that?

09:48.360 --> 09:50.350
You've been talking
the whole time.

09:50.360 --> 09:52.360
Fine.
I don't get anything.

09:52.360 --> 09:54.090
No...
Hey, pal.

09:54.090 --> 09:56.090
Before you call your dad,
what I was saying about Dede

09:56.100 --> 09:58.800
was me just covering up
because I lost

09:58.800 --> 10:01.740
the greatest, most stable person
I've ever known.

10:01.740 --> 10:03.290
But you seemed so angry.

10:03.300 --> 10:05.130
It's because
I can't get over her.

10:05.140 --> 10:07.770
I've tried everything...
Therapy, pills, electricity.

10:07.770 --> 10:09.300
([voice breaking)
I'm sorry. It's just that

10:09.310 --> 10:10.780
I miss her so much.

10:10.780 --> 10:12.550
I-I'm gonna see
the luckiest man in the world

10:12.550 --> 10:15.480
marry the most wonderful woman
in the world, and I have nobody.

10:15.480 --> 10:17.280
Excuse me, sir.

10:17.280 --> 10:19.040
This woman says she's your wife.

10:19.050 --> 10:19.940
Never seen her before.

10:19.950 --> 10:21.480
(shouting in Spanish)

10:21.490 --> 10:25.090
But here's someone I do know...
My son, Mitchell.

10:25.090 --> 10:26.720
Mitchell and Dede
are great pals.

10:26.730 --> 10:28.660
Tell these lovely folks
about your mother.

10:28.660 --> 10:29.990
She's a scheming dragon woman

10:30.000 --> 10:31.670
hell-bent on destroying
everyone around her.

10:31.670 --> 10:33.260
You pick today to realize that?!

10:33.270 --> 10:35.170
You're welcome.
I finally got him to see Mom

10:35.170 --> 10:38.840
for who she really is...
A nasty, old nutjob.

10:38.840 --> 10:40.280
But she's someone else's
problem now, huh?

10:40.270 --> 10:41.470
Mm-hmm.
Wait a minute.
You know what?

10:41.470 --> 10:42.600
I don't know
these people, either.

10:42.610 --> 10:43.850
Let's go. Excuse me.
(sighs)

10:43.850 --> 10:45.470
Pardon us.

10:45.480 --> 10:47.450
Hi. I'm Haley.

10:47.450 --> 10:49.450
Pleasure.
I'm a massive fraud.

10:49.450 --> 10:50.990
Sounds like you need a drink.

10:50.990 --> 10:52.410
I'm not sure that's a good idea.

10:52.420 --> 10:53.820
I used to have something of a...

10:53.820 --> 10:55.860
Oh, come on.
I feel weird drinking alone.

10:55.860 --> 10:58.160
I don't.
I just wanted him to pay.

10:58.160 --> 11:00.300
The last time
I was this bladdered,

11:00.300 --> 11:04.460
I parked my fist right
in Salman Rushdie's smug gob.

11:04.460 --> 11:05.820
(chuckles)

11:05.830 --> 11:07.530
Do you know Adele?
Oh.

11:07.530 --> 11:11.530
- There he is.
- Hey. Just checking in. Hi.

11:11.540 --> 11:13.370
Ooh, celebrating
solving your problem?

11:13.370 --> 11:16.470
After 10 years
of paralyzing writer's block,

11:16.480 --> 11:17.950
I at last felt
that I was drinking

11:17.950 --> 11:20.270
directly from the teat
of the muse.

11:20.280 --> 11:22.980
But she was no muse.
She was a succubus.

11:22.980 --> 11:24.780
Such a gift for language.

11:24.780 --> 11:27.980
At the next stop,
I'm going to burn this book.

11:27.990 --> 11:30.290
That is bad-ass.
No! What?

11:30.290 --> 11:33.390
Yes. It will be the last act
of my career.

11:33.390 --> 11:36.190
Well, not counting the panel
discussion in Portland.

11:36.200 --> 11:37.630
It would be rude to cancel.

11:37.630 --> 11:39.370
There's a wine-and-cheese
reception.

11:39.370 --> 11:40.670
You have to finish.

11:40.670 --> 11:43.200
What if we proved
it could happen?

11:43.200 --> 11:45.460
Maybe there's another way
for the murderer

11:45.470 --> 11:47.000
to get to the caboose and back.

11:47.010 --> 11:48.910
I've filled the train
with characters

11:48.910 --> 11:51.510
who cannot know that
the engineer has left his post.

11:51.510 --> 11:53.350
(brakes squealing)
It's hopeless!

11:53.350 --> 11:54.850
Wait. Did we just stop?

11:54.850 --> 11:56.050
No. I don't think so.
No. Mnh-mnh.

11:56.050 --> 11:58.080
(imitates train chugging)

11:58.080 --> 12:00.480
(imitates train whistle blowing)

12:03.220 --> 12:05.520
Look how beautiful
California is.

12:05.520 --> 12:07.420
The best part about
taking the train,

12:07.430 --> 12:10.930
as I often do for my work with,
uh, the children,

12:10.930 --> 12:12.430
has got to be the scenery.

12:12.430 --> 12:14.390
Yeah?
What's your favorite spot?

12:14.400 --> 12:17.570
Well, I'd have to say
the spot where, uh...

12:17.570 --> 12:20.070
the Rio Grande pours
into Lake Superior.

12:20.070 --> 12:22.530
Huh. I don't think
I've seen that.

12:22.540 --> 12:24.440
Can you excuse me
for just a pinch?

12:24.440 --> 12:26.640
Sure.

12:32.590 --> 12:34.020
What are you doing?

12:34.020 --> 12:36.620
Getting swollen
'cause that's how you close.

12:36.620 --> 12:38.550
(grunts) Oh, by the way,

12:38.560 --> 12:41.300
if you see a tie on our door,
Luke's starting to score.

12:41.300 --> 12:44.590
It's a little hard
to root for you right now.

12:44.600 --> 12:47.230
So, where were we?

12:47.230 --> 12:50.030
Is this your first time seeing
the Central Coast, Big Sur?

12:50.040 --> 12:52.770
No, it's not, little miss.
(chuckles)

12:52.770 --> 12:55.900
I can't wait to watch the sunset
over the Andes tonight.

12:55.910 --> 12:58.450
Not like my view right now
isn't fantastic.

12:58.450 --> 13:00.810
You're cute.
(exhales sharply)

13:00.810 --> 13:02.240
You know, if you're into it,

13:02.250 --> 13:04.790
I think I could show you
a few things.

13:04.790 --> 13:08.610
(loudly) Uh...
it's a little loud in here.

13:08.620 --> 13:10.580
Maybe we should go
somewhere more quiet.

13:10.590 --> 13:11.820
Sure.

13:11.820 --> 13:13.480
Really?

13:13.490 --> 13:15.920
Trains.

13:15.930 --> 13:18.660
(indistinct conversations)

13:18.660 --> 13:20.220
You're so serious.
(chuckles)

13:20.230 --> 13:22.090
I want to make sure
I capture your beauty.

13:22.100 --> 13:23.130
Can I see yet?

13:23.140 --> 13:24.970
I hope you like it.

13:28.770 --> 13:30.100
Oh!

13:30.110 --> 13:31.310
So, he's not an artist.

13:31.310 --> 13:33.110
Who cares?
(chuckles)

13:33.110 --> 13:35.310
(up-tempo fiddle music
playing)

13:35.310 --> 13:39.240
(loud, indistinct conversations)

13:39.250 --> 13:42.480
People in first class
think they have it made

13:42.490 --> 13:43.690
with their early boarding

13:43.690 --> 13:44.970
and their
slightly cleaner seats.

13:47.160 --> 13:49.260
But they don't know
what living is.

13:49.260 --> 13:51.860
(rhythmic clapping)

13:58.700 --> 14:01.130
I'll take a long line
for the bathroom

14:01.140 --> 14:02.980
if that bathroom is in heaven.

14:02.980 --> 14:05.180
(music stops)

14:05.180 --> 14:07.050
I'm so glad you came back here.

14:07.050 --> 14:08.050
Me, too.

14:10.380 --> 14:11.610
This feels weird.

14:11.620 --> 14:13.150
Do you have a compartment?

14:13.150 --> 14:15.610
I do, but how
will you get up there?

14:15.620 --> 14:18.120
I'll find a way.
I promise.

14:19.730 --> 14:23.060
Oh, by the way,
I'm in compartment 18B,

14:23.060 --> 14:25.160
as in, "Boy, are you cute."

14:25.160 --> 14:26.120
(giggles awkwardly)

14:26.130 --> 14:27.990
Idiot. Just keep walking.

14:28.000 --> 14:29.740
Got it.
♪ I have a signal ♪

14:29.740 --> 14:31.640
Oh, good.
Guys, guys, guys, come on.

14:31.640 --> 14:34.170
The only signal we need is this.

14:34.170 --> 14:36.200
My kids in the back...
They don't hate Dede.

14:36.210 --> 14:38.050
They're preparing a roast
for the wedding.

14:38.050 --> 14:39.640
That's how
our family shows love.

14:39.650 --> 14:41.380
You'll get a taste of it
at the reception.

14:41.380 --> 14:42.680
What are you, Italian?

14:42.680 --> 14:44.010
We'll do a whole thing,

14:44.020 --> 14:45.250
unless you
shoot the place up first.

14:45.250 --> 14:46.580
Oh.
See? That kind of stuff.

14:46.590 --> 14:49.060
Jay Pritchett, I am going
to strangle you!

14:49.060 --> 14:50.690
I don't know
why you're pretending

14:50.690 --> 14:52.360
that you don't know me,

14:52.360 --> 14:54.360
but I'm sure it's for some
stupid and selfish reason!

14:54.360 --> 14:55.730
She really is your wife?

14:55.730 --> 14:57.200
For now.

14:57.200 --> 14:58.900
Pretty soon, you're gonna be
getting on a train

14:58.900 --> 15:00.400
to <i> my</i> next wedding.

15:00.400 --> 15:01.870
You're driving me insane.

15:01.870 --> 15:04.510
Oh, I see
what's going on.
Don't listen to her.

15:04.510 --> 15:06.660
Dede's not crazy.
<i>You</i> are.

15:06.670 --> 15:08.100
Sure. That works.

15:08.110 --> 15:09.440
Who are you?

15:09.440 --> 15:12.040
Oh, I'm Carl.
Uh, my father's marrying Dede.

15:12.040 --> 15:14.410
Yes, he is, and let's celebrate.
Drinks on me.

15:14.410 --> 15:15.840
(chuckles)
What the heck.
And, again, I'm sorry

15:15.850 --> 15:17.920
to have worried you guys
about Dede.

15:17.920 --> 15:19.450
Oh, please.
It's not like Carl's father

15:19.450 --> 15:21.910
is such a prize.
(chuckles)
(chuckles nervously)

15:21.920 --> 15:23.680
What? He snapped and burned
your mom's house down.

15:23.690 --> 15:24.930
(chuckles nervously)
She's kidding.

15:24.930 --> 15:26.420
Uh, we're doing a roast, too.

15:26.430 --> 15:28.630
Yeah, right.
Your mother was almost a roast.

15:36.700 --> 15:39.030
We needed to prove
that the crime was feasible,

15:39.040 --> 15:41.310
so I would play the role
of engineer/murderer.

15:41.310 --> 15:43.440
And I would play the role
of everyone else.

15:43.440 --> 15:45.970
When my hometown theater's
production of <i> "Robin Hood"</i>

15:45.980 --> 15:48.420
was lacking a leading lady,
I stepped into the role

15:48.420 --> 15:50.940
of Maid Marian in addition
to playing the Friar.

15:50.950 --> 15:52.290
Tuck?
Didn't have to.

15:52.290 --> 15:54.180
The costume hid it quite nicely.

15:58.960 --> 16:00.160
Sunday dinner!

16:00.160 --> 16:01.390
What?!

16:01.390 --> 16:02.650
The Turkish ambassador's
bodyguard

16:02.660 --> 16:04.560
was instructed
to neutralize anyone

16:04.560 --> 16:06.260
who looks suspicious.

16:06.270 --> 16:07.600
Ustten!

16:07.600 --> 16:08.770
What?

16:08.770 --> 16:10.270
It's Turkish
for "from the top."

16:10.270 --> 16:11.410
I have a lot of downtime
while you're resetting.

16:11.400 --> 16:12.400
Oh.

16:13.970 --> 16:15.300
Woof!

16:15.310 --> 16:16.910
Did you forget
Count Maxim du Vernay

16:16.910 --> 16:18.250
brought his
service shar-pei?

16:18.250 --> 16:20.940
If I'm being honest,
I skimmed that part.

16:20.950 --> 16:23.180
Again!

16:23.180 --> 16:24.480
(knock on door)

16:27.420 --> 16:29.290
Hi. You ready for me?

16:29.290 --> 16:31.660
I believe I've Googled
everything I need to know.

16:35.630 --> 16:37.200
(exhales sharply)

16:37.200 --> 16:39.570
So, let's get started.

16:43.370 --> 16:45.170
This is California.

16:45.170 --> 16:48.800
Lake Superior is here,
all the way across...

16:48.810 --> 16:50.310
Are you trying
to take off my shoe?

16:50.310 --> 16:52.180
I thought you wanted
to show me things.

16:52.180 --> 16:53.680
I do.

16:53.680 --> 16:58.850
I'm a geography teacher, and,
boy, do you need one.

16:58.850 --> 17:00.140
Are you kidding me?

17:00.150 --> 17:02.950
If her new husband
is an arsonist,

17:02.960 --> 17:04.460
you guys have to tell her.

17:04.460 --> 17:06.230
Everybody, calm down.
The guy burned down one house.

17:06.230 --> 17:09.160
He's not in jail, so he's got
the government's A-okay.

17:09.160 --> 17:10.560
I recently discovered
I have some issues with Mom,

17:10.560 --> 17:12.119
but I love her.

17:12.130 --> 17:14.130
I don't want her to wake up
in a burning house

17:14.130 --> 17:16.030
just so you don't have to
pay alimony.

17:16.040 --> 17:17.510
I love Mom, too...
usually.

17:17.510 --> 17:19.300
But if this wedding
doesn't happen,

17:19.310 --> 17:21.640
you know where she's
gonna end up in 10 years...

17:21.640 --> 17:24.910
Su casa or... my... casa.

17:24.910 --> 17:27.880
Besides, the first wife
obviously drove the guy nuts.

17:27.880 --> 17:30.050
How do we know
your mother's gonna...

17:30.050 --> 17:31.620
Oh, geez.

17:34.850 --> 17:37.010
Cindy: Luke, you're such
a quick learner.

17:37.020 --> 17:39.580
Luke: Thanks.
I had no idea that was there.

17:41.730 --> 17:44.170
(sighs)
Alex: Come in.

17:47.330 --> 17:49.190
Is that you?
Uh-huh.

17:49.200 --> 17:50.830
I'll be out in a second.

17:50.840 --> 17:53.240
This is so naughty.

17:53.240 --> 17:55.240
I was going to see Alex
and let her down easy.

17:55.240 --> 17:57.200
I mean, she's family.
It's taboo.

17:57.210 --> 17:58.880
I'm sorry.

17:58.880 --> 18:02.650
I shouldn't be judgy, especially
when, you know, trains.

18:05.350 --> 18:08.950
Ooh. Dark.
I like it.

18:08.950 --> 18:11.020
(both scream)

18:11.020 --> 18:12.350
I-I was going
to let you down!

18:12.360 --> 18:14.390
You sure did!

18:14.390 --> 18:17.120
Well, your hat was garish.

18:17.130 --> 18:18.560
Excuse me.

18:18.560 --> 18:20.090
Have any of you guys
seen the guy

18:20.100 --> 18:21.800
I was dancing with earlier?

18:21.800 --> 18:24.910
So, it turns out James got off
right after I left him.

18:24.910 --> 18:29.230
On a possibly unrelated note,
my wallet is gone.

18:29.240 --> 18:30.270
Trains.

18:30.280 --> 18:32.410
Mr. Hastings, we did it.

18:32.410 --> 18:36.040
We made it to the caboose
and back without being seen.

18:36.050 --> 18:37.250
Your book works.

18:37.250 --> 18:38.720
I can't believe it.
Are you sure?

18:38.720 --> 18:40.250
Yes!
Yes.

18:40.250 --> 18:41.580
It's a combination
of slithering, clever disguise,

18:41.590 --> 18:43.090
and not to write
the book for you,

18:43.090 --> 18:44.790
but it would help if the Count
had a wooden hand.

18:44.790 --> 18:47.060
Well, I was sort of
in that area anyway.

18:47.060 --> 18:48.260
A thousand thank-yous.

18:48.260 --> 18:50.430
(chuckles)
Silverton lives!

18:50.430 --> 18:52.970
(laughs)
Yay!

18:52.970 --> 18:55.300
Hi. Oh, you guys are doing
that book thing, right?

18:55.300 --> 18:57.630
Yeah.
Well, I don't know
if this helps at all,

18:57.640 --> 18:59.170
but I was just talking
to the engineer.

18:59.170 --> 19:00.770
It turns out
he can't leave the controls

19:00.770 --> 19:02.470
because of what's called
a dead man's switch.

19:02.470 --> 19:05.940
If he takes his foot off of it,
the whole train stops.

19:05.940 --> 19:07.470
Anyway, you're welcome.

19:12.690 --> 19:16.160
If the engineer can't leave
the controls, then...

19:16.160 --> 19:18.660
He can't commit the murder.
It's over.

19:18.660 --> 19:20.790
Hastings, we are so sorry.

19:20.790 --> 19:23.920
(groans)
It's time to rid myself

19:23.930 --> 19:26.000
of this 500-hundred page
stain.

19:26.000 --> 19:27.440
Wait! No!
No, no, no, no!

19:27.440 --> 19:28.830
Open, damn you!
No, no!

19:28.830 --> 19:30.130
Wait!
Wait!

19:30.140 --> 19:31.610
Is that the back of the train?

19:31.610 --> 19:33.300
(train whistle blows)

19:33.310 --> 19:36.140
Yep. This is the famous
horseshoe turn.

19:36.140 --> 19:38.370
Only two of them in
the continental United States,

19:38.380 --> 19:40.480
one of which is here
in California,

19:40.480 --> 19:41.980
which is in North America.

19:41.980 --> 19:45.180
Sadly, I know
all of this now.
That's it.

19:45.180 --> 19:47.450
The engineer... He never has to
leave the controls.

19:47.450 --> 19:49.280
He waits for the horseshoe turn.

19:49.290 --> 19:52.490
Then he plugs the Earl
in the caboose. I heard it.

19:52.490 --> 19:54.320
This is brilliant!

19:54.330 --> 19:57.830
I can't believe you two clowns
have saved my book.

19:57.830 --> 19:59.970
Actually, it's just one clown.

19:59.970 --> 20:02.530
One magician.

20:02.530 --> 20:04.160
(tablet dings)
Hey, Mom! Hi!
Hi, Mom!

20:04.170 --> 20:06.670
Well, hello, original family.

20:06.670 --> 20:08.330
Dede, we have something
we have to tell you.

20:08.340 --> 20:10.240
Now, I know there's
a delicate way to say this.

20:10.240 --> 20:12.040
Just can't think of it.

20:12.040 --> 20:14.170
Your fiancé's a pyro.

20:14.180 --> 20:16.320
He burnt down
his ex-wife's house.

20:16.320 --> 20:20.220
It's just like you three
to try to ruin my big day.

20:20.220 --> 20:22.060
Mom, we just thought
you should know.

20:22.060 --> 20:23.510
Jerry told me everything.

20:23.520 --> 20:25.350
Trust me.
She had it coming.

20:25.360 --> 20:26.730
The woman's "cah-razy."

20:26.730 --> 20:28.700
So, you're okay he's a firebug?

20:28.700 --> 20:30.550
He's passionate, Jay.

20:30.560 --> 20:34.020
He knows how to express
his feelings, unlike you.

20:34.030 --> 20:36.060
Maybe if you had
burned our house down,

20:36.070 --> 20:37.700
we'd still be together.

20:37.700 --> 20:39.330
My mistake.
You're right, Dede.

20:39.340 --> 20:41.940
Great, Mom.
See you at the wedding.
Bye.

20:41.940 --> 20:44.010
Claire, you're not mad at me

20:44.010 --> 20:45.680
about your
seating arrangements?
Why? Where am I sitting?

20:45.680 --> 20:47.950
Mitchell, tell her.
Got to run.

20:47.950 --> 20:49.250
(tablet beeps)

20:49.250 --> 20:51.420
You're not sitting
at the family table.

20:51.420 --> 20:52.990
Hello!

20:57.720 --> 20:59.080
Phil sent me
his Silverton fan fiction,

20:59.090 --> 21:01.120
<i>"Open House, Closed Casket."</i>

21:01.130 --> 21:03.230
"He looked up
at the pristine crown molding

21:03.230 --> 21:05.030
in the great room
and felt the breeze

21:05.030 --> 21:07.230
of the recently updated
central air.

21:07.230 --> 21:10.730
'Mrs. Coruthers, just as
this desirable corner lot

21:10.740 --> 21:14.810
was split in half,
so, too, is Mr. Coruthers.'

21:14.810 --> 21:16.810
The widow gasped
and steadied herself

21:16.810 --> 21:19.380
on the granite kitchen island,
a fitting metaphor

21:19.380 --> 21:22.080
for how alone she felt,
despite being walking distance

21:22.080 --> 21:25.920
to a vibrant shopping district
and wonderful schools."

21:25.920 --> 21:28.120
I've been avoiding him
for the last two weeks.

21:28.120 --> 21:31.160
(telephone rings)
Don't answer that!
