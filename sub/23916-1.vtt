01:58.200 --> 02:00.082
Forgive me.

02:41.600 --> 02:44.046
Do this, like you're lifting weights.

02:44.240 --> 02:46.402
All the way, yes.

02:46.640 --> 02:48.722
Turn it around.

02:49.480 --> 02:51.305
Stretch out your fingers.

03:03.200 --> 03:06.243
You have a phone call on line two.
The police.

03:06.600 --> 03:09.001
Thanks... Freyr.

03:42.440 --> 03:44.283
You locked the car, right?

03:46.040 --> 03:47.644
Fuck.

03:48.280 --> 03:51.011
This is Isafjorour.
It should be all right.

03:52.840 --> 03:56.526
I'm joking. Relax.
Of course I locked the car.

03:59.080 --> 04:01.890
Lif. Take a picture.

04:49.560 --> 04:52.450
- Hello. Dagny.
- Hello. Freyr.

04:53.640 --> 04:56.564
- Have you done this before?
- No. I haven't.

04:56.720 --> 04:59.963
I called Gerour, she's a pathologist
and went over it with her.

05:00.160 --> 05:01.685
I've got a checklist.

05:04.600 --> 05:06.250
Morning.

05:12.000 --> 05:13.968
Halla Unnsteinsdottir.

05:14.160 --> 05:16.845
71 years old.
Lived in Flateyri.

05:19.320 --> 05:20.970
Did she do all this?

05:22.000 --> 05:23.729
So it seems.

05:24.040 --> 05:27.010
Let's cut her down
now that you are here.

05:27.600 --> 05:29.364
Boys.

05:29.920 --> 05:31.490
Will you do the autopsy?

05:31.720 --> 05:34.007
Gerour will do it
when she arrives tomorrow.

05:35.760 --> 05:38.081
He found her.

05:39.080 --> 05:40.650
I see.

05:46.560 --> 05:47.800
Hello... Freyr.

05:48.040 --> 05:51.681
- I'm a doctor at the hospital.
- Einar Guojonsson.

05:51.840 --> 05:53.410
Please.

06:04.480 --> 06:06.847
When people die like this...

06:08.000 --> 06:10.048
Hang themselves...

06:10.240 --> 06:12.288
Then the cause of death is

06:12.760 --> 06:15.843
that blood is no longer
flowing to the brain.

06:16.920 --> 06:19.810
People lose consciousness very quickly.

06:20.760 --> 06:22.603
It's rather painless.

06:22.760 --> 06:24.683
Almost like falling asleep.

06:33.400 --> 06:35.289
Aren't you...

06:35.680 --> 06:37.330
a psychiatrist?

06:41.320 --> 06:43.084
Freyr!

07:02.440 --> 07:05.489
Thank you for your words in there.

07:05.720 --> 07:07.802
What you said... it consoled me.

07:08.800 --> 07:11.351
Especially since it was you
who said it.

07:11.452 --> 07:14.066
After all you've had to go through.

07:14.240 --> 07:15.265
Yeah.

07:16.720 --> 07:19.200
It's hard to imagine
how you can get over

07:19.360 --> 07:21.044
a thing like that.

07:21.240 --> 07:24.005
Everybody...
has to deal with something.

07:24.200 --> 07:26.089
You do it one day at a time.

07:26.360 --> 07:28.567
Children don't just disappear
in Iceland.

07:29.200 --> 07:32.329
I just...
Just don't understand it.

07:32.480 --> 07:34.721
Yet that's what happened to my Benni.

07:36.480 --> 07:38.642
- Goodbye.
- Yes.

08:28.200 --> 08:30.965
- Are you going to sleep in the house?
- Yes.

08:31.160 --> 08:32.969
You think that's a bad idea?

08:33.640 --> 08:36.325
Nobody's lived in that house
since the town was abandoned.

08:36.559 --> 08:38.164
I know.

08:41.400 --> 08:44.483
- You weren't with them last summer?
- No, I couldn't make it.

09:15.360 --> 09:17.647
Welcome to Last Sight.

09:17.800 --> 09:19.848
- Do you like it?
- Well...

09:20.000 --> 09:22.321
There is a lot to be done.

09:22.480 --> 09:25.848
- It was quite different last summer.
- I know that.

09:26.400 --> 09:28.323
It'll all be different in a week's time.

09:28.480 --> 09:30.721
What are you going to do
with this house?

09:30.880 --> 09:33.690
We are going to turn it
into a bed and breakfast.

09:34.480 --> 09:36.289
There's a lot of tourists here
in the summer.

09:36.440 --> 09:39.171
The only guesthouse here
was booked solid last summer.

09:40.600 --> 09:43.570
- Isn't it rotten through?
- No.

09:43.720 --> 09:45.802
The timber's quite solid.

10:03.680 --> 10:05.330
Try it.

10:09.840 --> 10:12.286
- It works.
- Nice.

10:17.360 --> 10:20.409
- There's a lot of space up here.
- Don't you think?

10:21.320 --> 10:22.890
I was wondering...

10:23.040 --> 10:25.646
We could have bunk beds here...

10:26.080 --> 10:29.163
And a cozy reading corner here.

10:31.640 --> 10:33.768
This must have been the children's room?

10:34.320 --> 10:37.085
Yes. It looks like it.

10:39.360 --> 10:41.010
Hey.

10:41.560 --> 10:45.246
How are you?
I haven't seen you since summer.

10:45.880 --> 10:49.043
Thanks for asking.
I'm much better.

10:51.880 --> 10:54.281
I feel like I've said goodbye to him.

10:57.480 --> 11:01.007
- I've stopped taking the drugs.
- I meet with a psychologist once a week.

11:01.280 --> 11:04.204
He says you never get
completely over it.

11:23.640 --> 11:26.928
Isn't this the Doctor's house,
where you stayed last summer?

11:27.600 --> 11:29.523
Yes. It is.

11:42.640 --> 11:44.768
I'll see you in a week.

11:45.760 --> 11:47.569
- Yes.
- But...

11:47.720 --> 11:50.883
If something happens
then you can call me.

11:52.520 --> 11:55.000
I thought there was no reception here.

11:55.200 --> 11:59.364
Well... You've to go up the hill
to get reception.

12:00.080 --> 12:02.162
But all right.

12:38.800 --> 12:40.802
Getting into shape, are we?

12:43.240 --> 12:44.765
Yes.

12:44.920 --> 12:46.490
Just...

12:46.640 --> 12:49.644
Also to clear the mind.
It helps with that.

12:50.760 --> 12:52.728
- Do you run?
- No.

12:52.880 --> 12:55.531
I find nothing more boring
than running around in circles.

12:58.160 --> 13:00.447
At least you are
getting to know the town.

13:00.600 --> 13:02.887
You've run up and down all the streets.

13:03.480 --> 13:05.005
You could say that.

13:06.320 --> 13:08.561
- I live here at number 23.
- You do?

13:12.680 --> 13:14.569
Should we have a cup of coffee?

13:16.440 --> 13:18.044
Yes.

13:18.240 --> 13:19.969
Let's do that.

14:05.920 --> 14:08.082
In my profession they would say

14:08.280 --> 14:10.408
this is a clear sign
of compulsive behavior.

14:11.200 --> 14:13.441
I woke up here the other day and

14:14.840 --> 14:17.650
and couldn't remember
what Benni looked like.

14:21.200 --> 14:23.043
What do you think happened?

14:24.840 --> 14:26.490
Oh, I'm sorry.

14:26.640 --> 14:28.529
No, no. It's all right.

14:28.680 --> 14:31.968
Benni was playing hide and seek
with a friend of his

14:32.240 --> 14:34.163
when he went missing.

14:34.960 --> 14:37.531
When eight year old boys
are playing hide and seek

14:37.680 --> 14:41.526
they don't hide behind
a street light or a bush.

14:42.320 --> 14:44.891
They can be very ambitious.

14:46.760 --> 14:48.569
And then...

14:55.520 --> 14:57.488
They searched everywhere.

14:57.640 --> 14:59.881
Everywhere.
Back and forth.

15:00.480 --> 15:02.687
Hundreds of people searched for him.

15:02.840 --> 15:04.569
All over the country.

15:08.960 --> 15:11.566
Do you have any hope he is still alive?

15:13.600 --> 15:15.489
No, Benni isn't alive.

15:17.600 --> 15:20.490
Benni had congenital diabetes.

15:21.000 --> 15:24.607
He had just been injected with insulin
when he went out to play.

15:25.280 --> 15:26.930
That means that...

15:27.320 --> 15:30.529
if he didn't get anything to eat
for hours

15:31.600 --> 15:33.887
then the body would go into shock.

15:36.880 --> 15:38.803
So he would have lost consciousness.

15:44.200 --> 15:46.567
Do you still want that cup of coffee?

16:18.920 --> 16:20.365
Hi.

16:22.280 --> 16:23.691
Hi.

16:24.040 --> 16:26.247
I think your wife is a bit cold.

16:26.720 --> 16:28.722
Is that so?

16:34.520 --> 16:36.045
I want you.

16:43.760 --> 16:45.444
Lif.

16:46.440 --> 16:48.044
Lif!

16:48.240 --> 16:49.844
I'm about to fuck my husband.

16:50.080 --> 16:51.889
Stop it.

16:54.520 --> 16:56.363
Are you sure you're ready?

17:07.880 --> 17:09.530
Don't you want to?

17:11.359 --> 17:12.964
Of course.

19:40.720 --> 19:42.404
Mom.

19:51.280 --> 19:53.089
Mom.

20:34.739 --> 20:35.739
Hi.

20:35.840 --> 20:37.244
- Hi.
- Hi.

20:38.360 --> 20:39.385
Are you OK?

20:39.540 --> 20:41.590
Yes, I was just trying
to get Garoar to understand

20:41.840 --> 20:44.411
that if we want a toilet
we need running water

20:44.560 --> 20:47.166
and we don't have it
until next summer.

20:47.320 --> 20:49.825
So if your little prince
can't poop in a bucket,

20:49.926 --> 20:51.730
he has to hold it in.

20:52.840 --> 20:54.490
Crazy.

20:54.640 --> 20:56.244
How are you?

20:57.640 --> 20:59.210
Good to see you.

21:00.520 --> 21:03.683
- Where were you?
- I took a walk around the area

21:04.360 --> 21:06.169
and found the cemetery.

21:07.200 --> 21:10.488
The cemetery?
Did you see any ghosts?

23:02.080 --> 23:03.809
Hello.

25:36.520 --> 25:39.000
It was great to get back to work.

25:39.200 --> 25:41.646
Are you trying to make
the house into a sauna?

25:41.800 --> 25:44.770
- The stove is out of control.
- You're out of control.

25:45.720 --> 25:47.563
Isn't it amazing

25:47.720 --> 25:50.166
that no one has lived in this house
for 60 years?

25:50.760 --> 25:53.525
It's time for this house
to live a new life.

25:54.320 --> 25:57.085
- New Lif.
- Very funny.

25:58.480 --> 26:00.403
That was a lame drum roll.

26:02.520 --> 26:04.568
Well, I'm going.

26:04.720 --> 26:06.324
To sleep.

26:06.480 --> 26:08.369
Good night.

26:08.520 --> 26:10.045
I'll come with you.

26:17.960 --> 26:19.883
- Good night.
- Good night.

26:21.040 --> 26:23.008
I'll turn the generator off.

26:35.760 --> 26:39.003
The newest scars are brand new.

26:39.200 --> 26:41.248
Made during the last 24 hours.

26:41.400 --> 26:43.004
The oldest ones...

26:43.200 --> 26:45.009
They are three or four years old.

26:45.400 --> 26:47.084
All of them crosses.

26:48.520 --> 26:51.763
I think it's clear she couldn't have
done it all on her own.

26:54.680 --> 26:56.364
Bjarni is here.

26:56.840 --> 26:59.730
- The widower.
- Yes. Great.

27:03.520 --> 27:05.761
The fact is that

27:07.880 --> 27:09.723
the marriage was

27:10.080 --> 27:13.641
going downhill the last few years.

27:14.960 --> 27:16.610
Why was that?

27:17.160 --> 27:20.607
I really don't know.

27:21.400 --> 27:23.402
Maybe because you abused her?

27:23.640 --> 27:25.210
Never!

27:26.720 --> 27:28.643
Why on earth do you think that?

27:28.880 --> 27:31.884
Why crosses?
Are you religious, Bjarni?

27:32.040 --> 27:35.044
I swear that I never hurt my Halla.

27:41.360 --> 27:44.603
Do you know of anyone
who could have wanted to hurt her?

27:45.480 --> 27:47.005
No.

27:48.480 --> 27:51.563
Once, when she woke up

27:52.520 --> 27:54.602
lnoficed

27:54.960 --> 27:57.725
some blood
on the back of her nightdress.

27:58.960 --> 28:01.566
She said she had eczema.

28:11.440 --> 28:14.330
Does the name Bernodus
have any meaning for you?

28:15.200 --> 28:16.850
No.

28:17.640 --> 28:19.529
Fine.

28:22.000 --> 28:23.650
Do you believe him?

28:25.080 --> 28:28.846
His daughter just confirmed that he
was with her down south all week.

28:30.040 --> 28:32.042
So he didn't make the new scars.

28:32.720 --> 28:35.200
So it's unlikely that he did the others.

28:35.600 --> 28:37.170
Yes.

28:37.960 --> 28:39.644
She said something else as well.

28:39.800 --> 28:43.486
She said Halla became
reclusive and distant

28:43.640 --> 28:45.881
when a good friend of hers died.

28:47.320 --> 28:51.211
It often happens with people at that age
when their friends start to die.

28:51.960 --> 28:56.284
They become depressed when they realize
their own end is coming closer.

28:58.920 --> 29:01.207
Didn't you say Gerour
would do the autopsy.

29:01.360 --> 29:03.408
Yes, she'll be here at noon.

29:04.360 --> 29:06.931
So why did you check
the back of the body?

29:08.160 --> 29:09.366
What?

29:10.880 --> 29:13.804
I was just working late. And...

29:13.960 --> 29:15.962
The power went so...

29:16.240 --> 29:18.891
So I went...
Down to the cellar.

29:19.160 --> 29:23.449
I just wanted to make sure
everything was ready for the autopsy.

29:24.560 --> 29:26.244
Why are you so embarrassed?

29:32.000 --> 29:34.002
Who was it

29:34.560 --> 29:36.483
you asked him about?

29:36.640 --> 29:38.210
Yes...

29:38.520 --> 29:40.045
Bernodus.

29:42.200 --> 29:45.249
It would actually be great to get your
professional opinion on one thing.

29:45.400 --> 29:47.767
Do you have time
to go down to the station?

29:47.920 --> 29:51.811
We found an old case connected to
the church where Halla was found.

29:58.680 --> 30:03.846
The police chief back then
was also a prolific amateur filmmaker.

30:05.720 --> 30:09.327
The church was disassembled

30:09.560 --> 30:11.528
and moved from Hesteyri in 1956

30:11.680 --> 30:13.762
after the village was abandoned.

30:13.920 --> 30:17.527
The former villagers were not happy
about it, to put it mildly.

30:27.040 --> 30:28.690
Looks familiar?

30:28.840 --> 30:32.083
- What year did you say it was?
- 1956.

30:32.280 --> 30:34.169
60 years ago.

30:34.720 --> 30:36.961
Veigar, do you have the new pictures?

30:40.560 --> 30:44.690
Do you think this was done
by the same person?

30:46.240 --> 30:47.969
Yes, absolutely.
I mean...

30:48.520 --> 30:50.284
You see how it is done.

30:50.520 --> 30:52.966
All capitals except the E's.

30:53.160 --> 30:55.845
The circle over the I...
I think it is obvious.

30:56.600 --> 30:59.888
So Halla did this?
Was she from Hesteyri?

31:00.160 --> 31:03.323
You said the former villagers were
furious when the church was moved?

31:03.480 --> 31:05.847
I did but she was from Isafjorour.

31:06.480 --> 31:10.929
This photo was taken a year before
the church was damaged. In 1956.

31:11.320 --> 31:15.245
Halla Unnsteinsdottir.
Here she is. Ten years old.

31:17.520 --> 31:20.364
Why have some of the faces
been crossed out?

31:21.800 --> 31:23.404
That's a good question.

31:26.160 --> 31:28.447
This photo was found at this boy's home.

31:28.600 --> 31:30.523
His name is Bernodus Pétursson.

31:31.240 --> 31:32.890
And here it says...

31:33.080 --> 31:38.007
Bernodus was caught in the act
of vandalizing the church.

31:38.520 --> 31:41.569
And he was from Hesteyri.

31:42.320 --> 31:43.526
And moved here.

31:43.680 --> 31:47.526
Bernodus is part of another case
from that same time.

31:49.240 --> 31:52.961
Only five days
after he was caught in the church...

31:53.680 --> 31:54.920
He...

31:56.240 --> 31:59.084
Bernodus Pétursson
went missing without a trace.

32:00.920 --> 32:03.161
He has never been found.

32:32.600 --> 32:34.329
God, I'm tired.

32:34.480 --> 32:37.245
- Time for a beer?
- What a great idea. Dibs on not going.

32:37.400 --> 32:38.925
Not going-

32:40.320 --> 32:41.890
That's life, my dear.

32:42.360 --> 32:43.885
Is it?

32:47.000 --> 32:49.207
- No.
- Damn.

32:49.360 --> 32:50.964
Great.

32:57.680 --> 33:00.604
It's completely stuck.
I can't move it.

33:01.000 --> 33:03.731
Did you take the pin?
Garoar?

34:21.280 --> 34:23.931
What happened?
Did you fall in the creek?

34:24.080 --> 34:25.969
No, I jumped into it.

34:26.960 --> 34:29.201
What are you doing with a cross?

34:29.719 --> 34:33.884
- Bergdis Ebenesardottir.
- It is supposed to be in the cemetery.

34:34.159 --> 34:37.607
There was a hole in the ground
like a cross had been removed.

34:38.199 --> 34:40.168
And then I found it in the creek.

34:40.480 --> 34:42.005
What was it doing there?

34:43.560 --> 34:45.289
How should I know?

34:49.080 --> 34:51.242
And what, did you leave
the beer behind?

34:55.239 --> 34:56.889
I just...

35:00.920 --> 35:03.241
- ls the generator off?
- Yes.

35:03.640 --> 35:06.405
We think it broke down.

35:10.040 --> 35:12.281
It would be nice to have
a beer right now.

35:12.640 --> 35:14.244
Not going!

35:15.960 --> 35:17.371
OK.

37:08.080 --> 37:09.650
Katrin.

37:10.320 --> 37:11.845
Katrin.

37:12.000 --> 37:13.764
No, don't.

37:13.920 --> 37:16.400
- Don't move her. Katrin.
- Yes.

37:16.560 --> 37:19.211
- Talk to me.
- Yes. I fell.

37:19.360 --> 37:20.691
- You fell?
- Yes.

37:20.920 --> 37:23.048
- Where did you hurt yourself?
- Here.

37:24.000 --> 37:26.367
- The leg.
- Do you feel pain in your leg?

37:26.520 --> 37:28.170
- Can you move?
- Yes.

37:30.040 --> 37:31.690
- Can you sit?
- Yes.

37:33.560 --> 37:35.085
Let me see.

37:35.280 --> 37:38.204
- Is it broken?
- I don't know.

37:38.680 --> 37:40.444
Does this hurt?

37:40.600 --> 37:42.170
- Yes.
- What about this?

37:43.320 --> 37:48.247
I'll go and try to call
for an emergency helicopter.

37:49.280 --> 37:50.930
That's not necessary.

37:52.920 --> 37:55.844
- It's just sprained.
- No, I'll try to contact the boat.

37:56.000 --> 37:58.651
- Let the hospital take a look.
- Yes.

37:59.080 --> 38:01.651
- I'm going to fix the pillow.
- Yes.

38:02.760 --> 38:04.091
Do you want one?

38:04.280 --> 38:05.964
- Two.
- Two.

38:09.520 --> 38:11.363
Here you are.

38:19.200 --> 38:20.804
Thank you.

38:21.840 --> 38:23.569
- Lie down.
- Yes, wait.

38:30.800 --> 38:33.406
I'll call the boat tomorrow, my love.

38:47.200 --> 38:49.362
It's all arranged by years.

39:22.760 --> 39:26.242
Bernodus was called Dirty.
And Unclean.

39:26.480 --> 39:30.280
When he refused to take his clothes off
and take a shower after gym.

39:36.840 --> 39:39.241
The scars were from different times.

39:39.400 --> 39:42.051
It had been going on for some years.

39:42.760 --> 39:45.411
18 crosses in total.

39:46.440 --> 39:49.842
The poor boy seems to have been
abused for years.

39:51.040 --> 39:54.806
The father was a drunk
and probably had mental issues.

39:57.560 --> 40:01.406
It says here that he was
a church warden at Hesteyri

40:01.560 --> 40:05.007
and was very angry
when the church was moved.

40:08.600 --> 40:13.811
The school nurse wrote a report
but it seems to have been ignored.

40:16.640 --> 40:18.324
How disgusting.

40:19.240 --> 40:22.608
- Different times.
- Children weren't protected like today.

40:22.760 --> 40:25.001
Nobody knew what
systematic bullying was.

40:25.280 --> 40:26.725
His parents.

40:26.880 --> 40:31.568
The mother, Bergdis Ebenesardottir
died when Bernodus was born.

40:31.720 --> 40:33.927
The father probably blamed Bernodus.

40:34.080 --> 40:35.650
Jesus.

40:37.720 --> 40:39.290
See here.

40:39.560 --> 40:41.767
Eight kids have been crossed out.

40:42.280 --> 40:43.520
Halla is one of them.

40:43.760 --> 40:47.446
Of those eight six are dead.

40:48.800 --> 40:50.086
What?

40:50.280 --> 40:52.248
Six out of eight dead?

40:52.400 --> 40:53.925
- Before they turned 70?
- Exactly.

40:54.200 --> 40:56.009
All died during the last three years.

40:56.200 --> 40:58.646
And moreover...
All died in accidents.

40:58.800 --> 41:02.088
Apart from Halla of course, she hung
herself. Gunnhildur Gisladéttir.

41:02.480 --> 41:04.050
She drowned.

41:04.320 --> 41:06.049
That was two years ago.

41:06.240 --> 41:07.730
Jon AEvarsson.

41:07.880 --> 41:11.441
He died of burn wounds. His house
caught fire in the middle of the night.

41:11.680 --> 41:14.684
Sigvaldi Konraosson.
He froze to death.

41:14.920 --> 41:17.810
He got lost walking on
Vatnajokull-glacier.

41:18.800 --> 41:21.246
And then this one.
Steinn Gunnbjornsson.

41:21.400 --> 41:22.925
He died in a car accident.

41:23.080 --> 41:26.050
Eighteen months ago.

41:26.240 --> 41:28.004
And finally, this one.

41:34.360 --> 41:36.169
Védis Arngrimsdottir.

41:36.520 --> 41:38.648
She was the first to die.

41:39.240 --> 41:41.766
She fell on garden shears and bled out.

41:42.800 --> 41:45.963
What? Were they sure it was an accident?

41:46.160 --> 41:48.367
How do you fall on garden shears?

41:50.480 --> 41:54.201
Could it be that Bernodus
just went into hiding somewhere?

41:54.360 --> 41:57.842
Maybe he just fled to Reykjavik.
Changed his name.

41:58.000 --> 42:02.403
Then he came back a few years ago
and sought his revenge.

42:06.560 --> 42:09.370
Think about it.
The kids who are crossed out...

42:09.520 --> 42:11.682
They bullied him terribly.

42:11.920 --> 42:15.163
And now they are all dying
in mysterious ways.

42:15.800 --> 42:18.883
So you are looking for a serial killer
who is 70 years old.

42:22.960 --> 42:25.361
Sorry, I'm late.
Let's begin.

43:32.480 --> 43:34.005
<i>Hello.</i>

43:35.880 --> 43:37.644
<i>Hello, daddy.</i>

43:37.880 --> 43:39.530
<i>Hello, daddy.</i>

43:41.640 --> 43:43.210
<i>Is it fun?</i>

43:49.800 --> 43:51.404
<i>See mommy.</i>

44:20.440 --> 44:21.965
Hi.

44:22.480 --> 44:25.211
I want to show you something.
Do you have some time?

44:25.360 --> 44:27.169
Yes. Come in.

44:31.360 --> 44:34.330
The last pictures of Benni
before he went missing.

44:35.280 --> 44:40.207
From the gas station at Artlinshofoi.
And what do you want to show me?

44:41.920 --> 44:43.490
I just got this.

44:43.640 --> 44:46.723
This is from the autopsy of Vedis,
the one who fell on the garden shears.

44:46.880 --> 44:48.211
God.

44:53.840 --> 44:55.330
See...

44:55.560 --> 44:58.723
Exactly the same pattern
as on Bernédus' back.

44:58.880 --> 45:00.689
And on Halla's back.

45:02.440 --> 45:05.728
Could it be some sort of religious cult?

45:06.880 --> 45:09.042
All those crosses and...

45:09.560 --> 45:11.927
The vandalism in the church. Unclean.

45:17.360 --> 45:21.160
Those two are still alive.
What do they say about all this?

45:21.320 --> 45:24.005
Well, this one, Ursula Astraosdottir...

45:24.280 --> 45:27.409
- She is at a nursing home here in town.
- Ursula?

45:27.880 --> 45:29.325
I've met her.

45:29.560 --> 45:30.971
I have.

45:31.160 --> 45:32.730
She is schizophrenic.

45:33.640 --> 45:36.689
She didn't say a word
the two times I have met her.

45:37.560 --> 45:40.291
And then this one.
Larus Helgason.

45:40.440 --> 45:42.044
He is a farmer in Onundarfjorour.

45:43.240 --> 45:45.242
I haven't been able to reach him.

45:56.600 --> 45:58.170
He doesn't answer.

46:42.640 --> 46:44.210
Hi.

46:55.200 --> 46:56.725
Garoar.

47:14.600 --> 47:16.170
Hello.

49:54.800 --> 49:56.643
Dagny.

50:23.000 --> 50:24.684
Hi, it's Dagny.

53:11.040 --> 53:12.724
Is it Katrin?

53:13.440 --> 53:15.010
Katrin.

53:15.200 --> 53:16.884
Katrin, are you there?

53:20.400 --> 53:21.925
Katrin.

53:26.440 --> 53:28.249
What are you doing?

53:29.800 --> 53:31.370
Are you OK?

53:34.400 --> 53:35.925
What happened?

53:36.200 --> 53:38.806
I swear...
There is someone down there.

53:39.040 --> 53:40.963
There is someone, there is someone.

53:41.160 --> 53:42.764
Down there?

53:44.600 --> 53:46.568
What happened?
Talk to me.

53:47.200 --> 53:48.725
There was...

53:48.880 --> 53:51.406
I went downstairs.

53:52.400 --> 53:54.641
The door shut and I couldn't open.

53:56.960 --> 54:00.442
- I didn't know there was a cellar here.
- Girls.

54:01.840 --> 54:04.081
Did you know there was a cellar here?

54:04.880 --> 54:06.484
There is a corpse down there.

54:07.040 --> 54:10.169
- What do you mean?
- There is a child's corpse down there!

54:10.320 --> 54:12.448
- A child's corpse?
- When will the boat come?

54:12.680 --> 54:14.250
We couldn't get reception.

54:14.400 --> 54:17.244
We tried and tried.
There is no signal here.

54:17.480 --> 54:19.847
- I can't stay here anymore.
- Me neither.

54:20.080 --> 54:23.482
We have to try to call again.
Go further.

54:23.640 --> 54:26.564
I can't stay in this fucking
house anymore.

54:26.720 --> 54:28.290
I mean it.

54:29.320 --> 54:31.766
- OK.
- We can go to the Doctor's house.

54:31.920 --> 54:33.490
Yeah?

54:55.240 --> 54:58.449
- How are you doing?
- I don't understand this.

55:03.040 --> 55:04.804
The whole nation followed the story.

55:04.960 --> 55:07.645
Not like this.
A total stranger.

55:07.800 --> 55:10.280
Why the hell would he be
obsessed with Benni?

55:12.800 --> 55:15.724
Maybe it was a hobby.
This is a very isolated place.

55:21.680 --> 55:24.411
But I understand why
you find it uncomfortable.

55:29.240 --> 55:31.607
Sometimes when I try to remember him

55:32.040 --> 55:34.042
I only see this blue coat.

55:36.160 --> 55:37.730
It was his favourite.

55:41.600 --> 55:43.921
- Got the stretcher ready?
- In the car.

55:50.240 --> 55:52.083
Do you know the cause of death?

55:52.280 --> 55:54.362
We think he drank clog remover.

56:02.520 --> 56:06.445
Are you sure nobody lived in the house
since the town was abandoned?

56:06.960 --> 56:08.724
I don't think so.

56:09.720 --> 56:12.610
This child must be connected
to the former owners.

56:14.320 --> 56:15.731
It could be anyone.

56:26.960 --> 56:28.883
No reception.

56:32.320 --> 56:34.209
I'm going up
to get the beds ready.

56:56.040 --> 56:57.644
Garoar!

56:58.760 --> 57:02.810
- Garoar!
- Yes? What?

57:02.960 --> 57:04.689
- Did you put it there?
- What?

57:04.840 --> 57:06.490
This is not funny!

57:06.640 --> 57:09.211
- I didn't put it there.
- Don't fuck with me!

57:09.720 --> 57:12.564
- Did you bring it here?
- Are you crazy?

57:20.840 --> 57:22.763
- Watch out!
- Are you kidding?

57:22.920 --> 57:24.524
My dear.

57:58.960 --> 58:00.724
Hello, Ursula.

58:01.840 --> 58:03.410
It's me, Freyr.

58:03.560 --> 58:06.040
The new doctor.
Remember me?

58:09.600 --> 58:12.968
I want to ask you
a few questions if that's OK.

58:15.320 --> 58:17.004
The photo.

58:28.200 --> 58:30.362
Do you remember these kids?

58:33.360 --> 58:35.044
That's you.

58:38.280 --> 58:39.805
This boy here.

58:40.360 --> 58:42.601
Bernodus Pétursson.

58:44.920 --> 58:46.729
Do you remember him?

58:49.360 --> 58:51.727
He vanished without a trace.

58:51.880 --> 58:53.609
Was never seen again.

58:56.000 --> 58:57.809
Ursula.

58:57.960 --> 59:00.327
Do you know what happened to him?

59:06.720 --> 59:08.529
Benni is at the bottom.

59:11.440 --> 59:14.649
Everything is green.

59:16.840 --> 59:18.569
What did you say?

59:19.880 --> 59:23.521
Benni what?

59:24.360 --> 59:26.488
What did you say?
Benni what?

59:26.640 --> 59:29.211
Everything green?
What is green?

59:29.360 --> 59:31.283
Ursula.

59:32.640 --> 59:34.722
Answer me.
What did you say?

59:34.880 --> 59:37.042
You said "Benni".
Why?

59:37.240 --> 59:38.810
- Benni what?
- Freyr.

59:38.960 --> 59:41.088
- Answer me. Ursula.
- Freyr.

59:52.840 --> 59:54.444
You must remember it.

59:54.600 --> 59:57.490
He said Benni hid himself
in a green submarine.

59:57.640 --> 59:59.210
Don't you remember?

01:00:01.760 --> 01:00:03.842
Can you take a look for me?

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.002
It's somewhere in the boxes.

01:00:08.440 --> 01:00:12.365
Just...
I want to take a look at it.

01:00:18.840 --> 01:00:20.410
Sure.

01:00:24.840 --> 01:00:27.241
I'll take the first flight tomorrow.

01:00:28.920 --> 01:00:30.809
What did Ursula say to you?

01:00:32.920 --> 01:00:36.447
I thought she mentioned Benni
but it was rather unclear.

01:00:36.760 --> 01:00:38.444
I have to go.

01:02:45.720 --> 01:02:47.643
Katrin!

01:02:51.040 --> 01:02:52.644
Katrin.

01:02:52.800 --> 01:02:56.202
We have to get out of here.
We have to get out of here.

01:03:15.320 --> 01:03:17.004
You have to eat, Katrin.

01:03:17.480 --> 01:03:19.881
You haven't eaten
since yesterday morning.

01:03:29.960 --> 01:03:31.689
I don't think we're alone here.

01:03:36.480 --> 01:03:39.290
I saw...
I saw a small boy.

01:03:49.480 --> 01:03:51.323
This was a big mistake.

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:53.525
To come all this way.

01:03:54.240 --> 01:03:56.288
It's been such a short time since...

01:03:56.520 --> 01:03:58.090
Since what?

01:04:01.720 --> 01:04:03.324
Since I had to...

01:04:03.640 --> 01:04:06.007
give birth... to our son?

01:04:07.080 --> 01:04:09.447
- Stillborn. Say it.
- Kata.

01:04:09.600 --> 01:04:12.251
- Why do you always have to do this?
- What?

01:04:12.400 --> 01:04:14.971
Just, it was traumatic for me too.

01:04:15.640 --> 01:04:18.530
All this nonsense,
nobody ever thinks about that.

01:04:19.920 --> 01:04:21.684
You didn't speak to me...

01:04:28.400 --> 01:04:31.688
I just felt like you thought
I was never doing enough.

01:04:35.200 --> 01:04:39.489
Why was it so important to you
that Lif not come with us here?

01:04:50.440 --> 01:04:51.965
Answer me.

01:04:55.200 --> 01:04:57.646
What happened here
between you two last summer?

01:05:03.840 --> 01:05:06.605
Things were over between us anyway.

01:05:06.760 --> 01:05:08.444
Wasn't it?

01:05:17.360 --> 01:05:20.489
Sometimes things just develop
in their own way.

01:05:21.600 --> 01:05:23.967
Without you being able to control it.

01:06:49.800 --> 01:06:52.724
Hello.

01:07:11.040 --> 01:07:12.690
How have you been?

01:07:13.360 --> 01:07:16.330
Freyr. You wanted to look
at the police reports?

01:07:16.480 --> 01:07:18.005
Yes.

01:07:19.360 --> 01:07:20.885
You know where they are.

01:08:20.640 --> 01:08:24.087
"Olafur Magnusson,
eight years old, autistic."

01:08:25.600 --> 01:08:27.363
"Cold. Very cold fingers.
I lost a mitten.

01:08:27.520 --> 01:08:29.443
Benni hid in the green submarine."

01:08:50.319 --> 01:08:51.924
Hello, On.

01:08:55.800 --> 01:08:57.450
Do you remember us?

01:08:57.600 --> 01:08:59.602
We're Benni's parents.

01:09:03.439 --> 01:09:06.011
His mom is here.
You remember her.

01:09:07.160 --> 01:09:08.810
Hi, On.

01:09:11.040 --> 01:09:13.167
What are you doing?

01:09:15.200 --> 01:09:17.362
Are you playing a video game?

01:09:21.760 --> 01:09:23.444
On.

01:09:24.200 --> 01:09:27.044
We want to ask you again
about the submarine.

01:09:29.319 --> 01:09:32.448
Oli. Wait a second.

01:09:32.600 --> 01:09:35.251
- On, is everything all right?
- Everything's fine.

01:09:35.399 --> 01:09:37.402
Oli, can you describe it?

01:09:37.720 --> 01:09:39.926
Oli, you said it was green.

01:09:40.080 --> 01:09:44.165
Oli, it wasn't a submarine,
there are no submarines in Iceland!

01:09:44.640 --> 01:09:46.846
- Why did you lie?
- Freyr.

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.685
- On!
- Freyr, let him go.

01:09:57.840 --> 01:09:59.524
Well...

01:09:59.760 --> 01:10:02.764
How would the psychiatrist
describe his behaviour in there?

01:10:10.440 --> 01:10:12.761
I want you to meet someone.

01:10:22.760 --> 01:10:25.206
What do we have to discuss
with a lawyer?

01:10:25.360 --> 01:10:28.011
I don't have time.
I have to catch a flight.

01:10:34.320 --> 01:10:35.845
Hello.

01:10:37.400 --> 01:10:39.562
- Elias Bjornsson.
- Hello. Freyr.

01:10:40.480 --> 01:10:43.723
Can I offer you something to drink?
Water, coffee?

01:10:44.040 --> 01:10:45.724
Excuse me.

01:10:46.160 --> 01:10:47.491
What...

01:10:47.720 --> 01:10:49.449
- What are we doing here?
- Freyr.

01:10:49.600 --> 01:10:53.446
Elias has been an incredible
help to me for the last few months.

01:10:54.080 --> 01:10:55.650
I see.

01:11:05.320 --> 01:11:08.164
He has been in contact with Benni.

01:11:09.960 --> 01:11:11.530
What?

01:11:13.320 --> 01:11:15.561
It would be more accurate
to say that...

01:11:15.880 --> 01:11:18.247
Benni made contact with me.

01:11:23.640 --> 01:11:27.531
I don't have the time or inclination
for nonsense like this.

01:11:27.680 --> 01:11:31.651
Freyr, you can at least listen to him.

01:11:35.160 --> 01:11:37.606
Vilhjalmur Alvar.
Arion Bank.

01:11:37.760 --> 01:11:39.888
Tell him I'll call in ten minutes.

01:11:43.640 --> 01:11:45.210
Listen.

01:11:45.360 --> 01:11:46.930
Benni is trapped.

01:11:47.720 --> 01:11:49.882
Trapped between two worlds.

01:11:50.480 --> 01:11:54.087
Sometimes when the end of life
is somehow unresolved

01:11:54.280 --> 01:11:56.601
people can't reach
the next plane of existence.

01:11:56.760 --> 01:11:59.889
Like when...
the body can't be found

01:12:00.040 --> 01:12:02.964
or when nobody knows what happened.

01:12:03.160 --> 01:12:06.926
The only thing that can release
these souls from their chains

01:12:07.080 --> 01:12:09.321
is if their body is found.

01:12:10.480 --> 01:12:15.327
And that the mystery
of their death is solved.

01:12:16.360 --> 01:12:18.169
Is that so?

01:12:19.040 --> 01:12:20.610
I see.

01:12:22.080 --> 01:12:23.684
And What?

01:12:29.600 --> 01:12:32.809
If those souls can't reach
the next plane of existence

01:12:33.480 --> 01:12:35.608
they can get trapped.

01:12:37.360 --> 01:12:39.488
And as more time goes by

01:12:39.640 --> 01:12:41.529
the more powerful they become

01:12:41.920 --> 01:12:45.242
and their problem can become obsession.

01:12:45.600 --> 01:12:48.444
Bitterness. And anger.

01:12:48.600 --> 01:12:51.285
They can make themselves visible.

01:12:51.840 --> 01:12:53.968
They can travel around.

01:12:54.240 --> 01:12:58.962
And then you who were part of his life
are in the biggest danger.

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.844
The thing is that Benni has to be found.

01:13:04.720 --> 01:13:06.324
As soon as possible.

01:13:06.480 --> 01:13:08.847
Or the consequences can be serious.

01:13:19.920 --> 01:13:21.490
What do you think

01:13:22.040 --> 01:13:24.805
we've been doing
for the last three years?

01:13:26.080 --> 01:13:28.890
It has ruined our lives.

01:13:33.760 --> 01:13:37.242
If I need a lawyer one day
I might contact you.

01:13:39.800 --> 01:13:41.928
The name Bernodus.

01:13:42.600 --> 01:13:44.648
Does it mean anything to you?

01:13:46.240 --> 01:13:48.242
It is mentioned again and again.

01:13:48.400 --> 01:13:50.289
But I can't explain why.

01:14:22.640 --> 01:14:24.210
Ah, I slept so good.

01:14:25.680 --> 01:14:27.648
Have you eaten anything?

01:14:29.400 --> 01:14:31.289
Where is Garoar?

01:14:37.840 --> 01:14:40.081
Isn't everything OK?

01:14:40.760 --> 01:14:43.206
Did you fuck him here on the counter?

01:15:07.680 --> 01:15:09.489
Katrin.

01:15:19.200 --> 01:15:21.168
What happened?

01:15:24.920 --> 01:15:26.922
What did you say to her?

01:15:29.040 --> 01:15:30.724
What...

01:15:30.880 --> 01:15:32.769
I just told her the truth.

01:15:33.760 --> 01:15:35.728
And what does that mean?

01:15:36.040 --> 01:15:38.042
Not everything, of course.

01:15:41.520 --> 01:15:44.683
- Why would you do that?
- She confronted me.

01:15:49.720 --> 01:15:53.008
Didn't we decide to wait
until we came back to town?

01:15:54.520 --> 01:15:57.888
Wasn't she just fishing?

01:15:58.280 --> 01:16:00.362
No. Lif.

01:16:00.600 --> 01:16:03.922
Katrin and I have been together
for twelve years.

01:16:04.280 --> 01:16:06.487
I know her, I saw it in her eyes.

01:16:07.440 --> 01:16:09.966
- She won't be able to handle it.
- No.

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.048
She's such a head case.

01:16:19.680 --> 01:16:22.251
Lif.
Look at me.

01:16:24.040 --> 01:16:25.769
It'll be all right.

01:16:26.560 --> 01:16:28.483
Now we just have to

01:16:28.640 --> 01:16:30.290
look to the future.

01:16:32.680 --> 01:16:36.844
I love you.

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:05.570
No.

01:19:31.920 --> 01:19:34.810
I'll go and call for help.

01:20:42.680 --> 01:20:45.445
"If you see this I'm at the house.
Katrin knows about us."

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:49.968
"Are you sure I'm the father?"

01:22:18.920 --> 01:22:20.684
Wait!

01:23:04.680 --> 01:23:05.886
Ursula.

01:23:07.200 --> 01:23:08.770
How did you get here?

01:23:16.400 --> 01:23:21.930
He's not always so mean to me.

01:23:22.200 --> 01:23:23.531
Who?

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:25.889
Bernodus.

01:23:28.400 --> 01:23:30.209
Was he here with you in the boat?

01:23:31.480 --> 01:23:33.050
Bernodus.

01:23:35.360 --> 01:23:37.886
He's always with me.

01:23:41.080 --> 01:23:42.286
Always.

01:23:45.280 --> 01:23:47.760
We were always teasing him.

01:23:49.240 --> 01:23:53.165
I was the only one
who saw where he went.

01:24:00.280 --> 01:24:03.090
I never told anyone.

01:24:03.800 --> 01:24:05.689
Never.

01:24:08.480 --> 01:24:10.164
Everything is green.

01:24:10.560 --> 01:24:12.164
Green?

01:24:13.280 --> 01:24:15.760
Where is everything green?
Ursula.

01:24:16.880 --> 01:24:20.965
Bernodus went away with the boat.

01:24:21.920 --> 01:24:25.925
What boat?
This one? The one we're in right now?

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.367
I never told anyone.

01:24:32.960 --> 01:24:35.486
Never. No.

01:24:36.160 --> 01:24:37.924
Everything is green.

01:24:39.360 --> 01:24:40.964
Green.

01:24:42.200 --> 01:24:43.281
Ursula.

01:24:43.800 --> 01:24:46.201
Benni is at the bottom,
everything is green.

01:24:46.360 --> 01:24:49.011
That's what you said.
That's what you said.

01:24:49.280 --> 01:24:51.681
Remember?
Why did you say that?

01:24:51.840 --> 01:24:53.649
Where is that?

01:24:53.800 --> 01:24:56.326
Where is everything green?

01:24:57.040 --> 01:24:59.327
Benni... Woke him up.

01:25:01.840 --> 01:25:04.889
Benni woke him up?
Bernodus?

01:25:05.160 --> 01:25:08.482
He shouldn't have woken him.

01:25:09.880 --> 01:25:13.168
Ursula.

01:25:39.960 --> 01:25:41.724
How are you feeling?

01:25:44.400 --> 01:25:47.563
Why were you in that boat
in the middle of the night?

01:25:48.760 --> 01:25:50.364
I saw a boy.

01:25:50.520 --> 01:25:53.524
- I followed him here.
- Boy?

01:25:56.280 --> 01:25:57.884
It was like...

01:25:59.160 --> 01:26:01.640
he was asking me to follow him.

01:26:01.800 --> 01:26:03.450
To Ursula.

01:26:04.760 --> 01:26:07.286
Who was the boy?

01:26:10.520 --> 01:26:12.329
I can't...

01:26:12.800 --> 01:26:14.450
Freyr.

01:26:17.560 --> 01:26:19.085
Bernodus.

01:26:20.840 --> 01:26:22.410
I have seen him before.

01:26:24.720 --> 01:26:26.609
I feel like that he is trying

01:26:27.760 --> 01:26:29.603
to help me.

01:26:32.360 --> 01:26:36.285
And that clairvoyant... who claims
to be in contact with Benni...

01:26:36.440 --> 01:26:39.728
He also mentioned him.
Bernodus.

01:26:41.200 --> 01:26:43.487
Ursula also talked about Bernodus.

01:26:45.840 --> 01:26:48.730
I fear that I'm losing my mind.

01:26:50.760 --> 01:26:54.606
I'm becoming like
one of my patients.

01:27:00.760 --> 01:27:02.842
Why can't I find him?

01:27:04.840 --> 01:27:07.241
Why can't I find Benni?

01:27:26.040 --> 01:27:28.725
- What is it?
- I need more green.

01:27:28.880 --> 01:27:32.771
- I need more green.
- You should be asleep.

01:27:34.800 --> 01:27:36.609
It's all right.

01:32:31.200 --> 01:32:32.884
Hi.

01:32:33.040 --> 01:32:36.203
Sorry, I was asleep.

01:32:37.080 --> 01:32:38.161
What?

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:44.889
Sorry.

01:32:48.840 --> 01:32:52.287
He has always said
Benni hid in a green submarine.

01:32:52.440 --> 01:32:54.010
And Ursula said:

01:32:54.720 --> 01:32:57.530
Benni is at the bottom.
Everything is green.

01:32:57.760 --> 01:32:59.603
Bottom of the ocean?

01:33:00.600 --> 01:33:01.840
I don't know.

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:11.809
Let me check something.

01:33:25.440 --> 01:33:26.965
Septic tank?

01:33:27.240 --> 01:33:29.083
Take a look.

01:33:32.760 --> 01:33:34.364
Wait.

01:33:34.520 --> 01:33:36.409
Do you still have the...

01:33:36.560 --> 01:33:39.166
The video from the gas station?
Showing Benni?

01:33:41.080 --> 01:33:42.684
Sure.

01:33:45.400 --> 01:33:46.925
Here.

01:33:47.200 --> 01:33:48.929
Let's see.

01:33:58.720 --> 01:34:00.404
There.

01:34:01.160 --> 01:34:04.562
I just didn't make the connection
until now.

01:34:06.320 --> 01:34:07.924
Wait.

01:34:22.840 --> 01:34:24.410
Those three.

01:34:24.640 --> 01:34:27.405
They were inside the gas station
when Benni walked out of there.

01:34:27.640 --> 01:34:28.846
And?

01:34:30.160 --> 01:34:31.730
They eat a meal.

01:34:31.880 --> 01:34:34.281
That's why they were there
for so long.

01:34:37.400 --> 01:34:39.482
This one is taken
out here in the tunnel.

01:34:39.640 --> 01:34:42.166
You can't see
what's on the trailer.

01:34:51.440 --> 01:34:53.408
Here it is.

01:34:53.560 --> 01:34:54.925
Hesteyri.

01:35:09.520 --> 01:35:13.445
The search for Benni must have been
in full swing at the time.

01:35:14.280 --> 01:35:17.363
So you probably weren't paying
attention to other news.

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:24.083
There is an abandoned whaling station
just outside of the village.

01:35:24.280 --> 01:35:28.205
There they found the bodies of
Garoar Magnusson and Lif Einarsdottir.

01:35:29.040 --> 01:35:31.441
Lif was pregnant with their child.

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:36.163
Katrin Porsdottir,
Garoar's wife...

01:35:36.320 --> 01:35:39.164
She probably tried to seek help on foot.

01:35:40.200 --> 01:35:43.329
Her body has never been found
despite an extensive search.

01:35:43.680 --> 01:35:47.082
Lif's phone was found
with Katrin's fingerprints on it.

01:35:47.280 --> 01:35:49.851
She had tried to call for help.

01:38:25.600 --> 01:38:30.640
I always thought it was misguided
to try to fix up this old shack.

01:38:31.520 --> 01:38:33.568
It's rotten through and through.

01:38:43.240 --> 01:38:45.447
- Can you help us?
- Sure.

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:03.500
