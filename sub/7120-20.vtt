WEBVTT

00:09.665 --> 00:12.635
Hey, man, it's couples-only
movie night tonight.

00:12.702 --> 00:13.761
Who are you bringing?

00:13.836 --> 00:15.736
I don't know. Who
are you bringing?

00:15.804 --> 00:17.636
I'm bringing my
girlfriend, dude.

00:17.706 --> 00:19.140
Oh.

00:20.275 --> 00:21.675
I'll take this duck.

00:21.743 --> 00:22.938
It's couples night.

00:23.011 --> 00:25.003
You got to bring
somebody you can smooch.

00:25.080 --> 00:26.776
Man, I don't wanna be smooched.

00:26.848 --> 00:28.179
Don't have to smooch.

00:28.249 --> 00:30.480
Just have to bring
somebody you can smooch.

00:30.551 --> 00:32.019
It's like the rules.

00:32.086 --> 00:34.078
Lame.

00:35.389 --> 00:37.517
Aah!

00:37.591 --> 00:39.957
Well, I'll take this blanket.

00:41.161 --> 00:42.629
Put the blanket down.

00:42.695 --> 00:43.754
Have a seat.

00:43.830 --> 00:47.926
I want to explain some
"things" to you about couples.

00:49.235 --> 00:51.760
So, you all square?
- Yeah, yeah.

00:51.837 --> 00:52.896
Who you gonna call?

00:52.971 --> 00:55.304
I'm going to call a girl
that I don't have to kiss.

00:58.076 --> 00:59.635
- Hello?
- Hi, Princess.

00:59.711 --> 01:02.112
Would you go to couples
movie night with me?

01:02.181 --> 01:03.876
Sounds romantic, Finn.

01:03.948 --> 01:06.884
No! I-I was just wondering
if you wanted to go with me.

01:06.951 --> 01:08.442
No, sorry, Finn.

01:08.519 --> 01:11.512
I'm busy practicing for
the Whistling Choir

01:11.589 --> 01:12.589
Death Match Championship.

01:12.657 --> 01:14.558
- But...
- Auf wiedersehen.

01:21.231 --> 01:23.291
- She doesn't want to go.
- Yeah, she does.

01:23.366 --> 01:24.891
We just need to
help her to realize

01:24.968 --> 01:26.630
she wants to go to
the movies with you.

01:26.703 --> 01:28.398
I'm calling Marceline.

01:28.470 --> 01:30.132
- What?
- Look, man...

01:30.206 --> 01:32.801
I've been learning a lot
about vampires lately.

01:32.875 --> 01:35.674
I realize now that my fear
was based on ignorance.

01:35.744 --> 01:36.837
Speak.

01:36.912 --> 01:38.244
Hey, hey, Marceline.

01:38.314 --> 01:39.838
Got a favor to ask, babe.

01:39.914 --> 01:41.849
We want to make Princess
Bubblegum jealous

01:41.916 --> 01:43.976
so she'll go to the
movies with Finn.

01:44.052 --> 01:45.953
Marceline?

01:46.020 --> 01:47.818
Come in. Hello?

01:47.889 --> 01:49.790
Aah!

01:49.858 --> 01:51.689
Are you gonna help us?

01:51.758 --> 01:52.851
Yeah, I'll help.

01:52.926 --> 01:54.326
It'll be funny.

01:54.394 --> 01:56.761
Okay, so, here's the plan...

01:56.830 --> 01:58.492
You start saying things,

01:58.565 --> 02:01.228
and you start laughing way loud.

02:01.301 --> 02:02.462
And then Bubblegum...

02:04.103 --> 02:05.935
will get jealous of you,

02:06.005 --> 02:07.803
which will awaken her Finn love.

02:07.874 --> 02:09.399
You start us off.

02:09.475 --> 02:10.374
Um...

02:10.443 --> 02:11.911
Hmm. Funny.

02:11.978 --> 02:14.140
Funny. Um...

02:14.213 --> 02:15.306
Giddyup?

02:18.316 --> 02:19.477
Um... diggy-diggy?

02:22.187 --> 02:24.053
Diggy-diggy! Diggy-diggy!

02:27.292 --> 02:28.589
Greetings, Finn.

02:28.659 --> 02:30.491
Hey, Marceline.

02:30.561 --> 02:32.223
Hello, Bonnibel.

02:32.296 --> 02:34.094
Yeah, yeah.

02:34.164 --> 02:36.156
So, what's so funny, Finn?

02:36.233 --> 02:39.226
I, um, uh...

02:39.303 --> 02:41.396
it's, uh, something.

02:41.471 --> 02:44.407
Well, then keep it
down out there.

02:44.474 --> 02:46.238
I'm trying to whistle practice.

02:48.978 --> 02:50.503
That was great.

02:50.580 --> 02:52.275
Now we begin phase two.

02:52.347 --> 02:54.111
It's so powerful.

02:54.182 --> 02:55.182
Wait here.

02:57.486 --> 03:00.251
Hey, look, Finn... I know
Jake's your friend and all,

03:00.322 --> 03:01.813
but if you really want Bubblegum

03:01.890 --> 03:03.449
to go to the movies with you,

03:03.524 --> 03:05.584
you've got to, like, stop
listening to your dog

03:05.660 --> 03:07.492
and take some advice
from a real girl.

03:07.561 --> 03:09.723
But Jake said phase
two is powerful.

03:09.797 --> 03:10.856
Pbht!

03:10.932 --> 03:12.798
How is Jake gonna
know what girls want

03:12.867 --> 03:13.994
more than a real girl?

03:14.068 --> 03:16.127
- Yeah...
- Okay, great.

03:16.202 --> 03:20.196
So, what we need now
is something... fun.

03:20.273 --> 03:22.265
Girls love fun more
than anything.

03:22.342 --> 03:23.469
Fun, fun, fun.

03:23.543 --> 03:25.375
If you can show Bubblegum
that you're fun,

03:25.445 --> 03:27.504
she'll defs want to go
to the movies with you.

03:28.480 --> 03:29.743
You said "fun" so much.

03:29.815 --> 03:31.147
It sounds all weird now.

03:31.216 --> 03:33.082
"F-F-Fun."

03:33.152 --> 03:34.450
"F..."

03:34.520 --> 03:37.183
So, what do you like
to do for fun, Finn?

03:37.256 --> 03:40.419
Oh! Oh! I like to
wrestle and fight!

03:40.491 --> 03:41.857
Grr!

03:41.926 --> 03:43.918
Roar!

03:43.995 --> 03:45.224
Girls don't like that.

03:45.296 --> 03:46.594
No, no, that's perfect.

03:46.664 --> 03:47.944
All you got to do
is get in there

03:47.999 --> 03:49.176
and wrestle Princess Bubblegum

03:49.200 --> 03:52.966
and show her how fun you are.

03:53.036 --> 03:54.902
"Fun-n-n."

03:54.972 --> 03:57.237
"Fun-n-n-n."

03:57.307 --> 03:59.208
Whoa. Where you going, man?

03:59.276 --> 04:00.437
Check it out.

04:00.510 --> 04:02.206
What is that stuff?

04:02.279 --> 04:03.610
It's a lute suit.

04:04.847 --> 04:07.009
Girls love it. Trust me.

04:10.152 --> 04:12.621
Finn, what the plum
are you wearing?

04:12.688 --> 04:13.849
You look horrible.

04:13.923 --> 04:15.323
It's a lute suit.

04:15.390 --> 04:16.824
And Finn looks adorable in it.

04:16.891 --> 04:18.916
Well, it's going
to ruin the plan.

04:18.994 --> 04:20.963
What's she talking about, Finn?

04:21.029 --> 04:25.057
Well, I was gonna give
Marceline's idea a try, too.

04:25.133 --> 04:26.692
Her idea?

04:26.768 --> 04:28.030
What's wrong with my idea?

04:33.507 --> 04:34.634
Oh, hey, Finn.

04:34.708 --> 04:36.176
Did you ever find some...

04:36.243 --> 04:38.678
Whoa. What are you wearing?

04:38.746 --> 04:40.373
Oh, this is my...

04:40.446 --> 04:43.314
lute suit.

04:43.383 --> 04:44.646
Uh...

04:44.717 --> 04:46.208
Oh, this is my...

04:46.285 --> 04:47.776
♪ lute suit ♪

04:47.854 --> 04:50.824
Finn!

04:50.890 --> 04:52.551
That is hilarious.

04:54.659 --> 04:56.719
Oh, you are killing me.

04:57.796 --> 04:59.287
Psst.

04:59.364 --> 05:01.162
Grr-rr!

05:01.233 --> 05:02.861
Oh, yeah.

05:02.934 --> 05:04.367
So...

05:04.435 --> 05:06.165
Headlock! Grr!

05:06.237 --> 05:07.603
Aah! Ugh!

05:07.671 --> 05:09.867
Aah! Guards!

05:15.279 --> 05:17.907
That suit was ridiculous.

05:17.981 --> 05:20.974
Ridi... ridiculous? What?

05:21.051 --> 05:22.986
Can you believe this girl, Finn?

05:23.053 --> 05:24.053
Huh? Can you?

05:24.087 --> 05:27.579
I guess the suit did
feel a little silly.

05:27.656 --> 05:29.488
Well, fine.

05:29.558 --> 05:30.958
You can just give it back, then.

05:31.026 --> 05:32.187
I'm sorry.

05:32.261 --> 05:34.730
Good luck getting to that
movie without my help.

05:34.797 --> 05:36.527
Harumph.

05:36.598 --> 05:38.863
Gee, he seems pretty ticked.

05:38.934 --> 05:41.164
Nah, he just needs
some spaghetti.

05:41.235 --> 05:42.567
Oh, okay.

05:42.637 --> 05:45.300
Well, taste this, then...
I got a new plan.

05:45.373 --> 05:46.568
Really?

05:46.641 --> 05:49.805
The only thing women love
more than fun is excitement.

05:49.877 --> 05:52.141
She needs to feel her
blood pump, man.

05:52.212 --> 05:54.545
She needs to be
chased by wolves.

05:54.614 --> 05:56.105
Like, metaphorically?

05:56.183 --> 05:59.051
Come on, I'll teach you how
to show a girl a good time.

05:59.119 --> 06:01.213
Hold tight. You ready?

06:01.288 --> 06:03.950
Uh... mm-hmm.

06:44.727 --> 06:46.787
Shh. She's probably asleep.

06:50.700 --> 06:52.497
This was a really good idea.

06:54.536 --> 06:56.562
Now don't blow it this time.

06:56.638 --> 06:58.004
Okay.

06:58.073 --> 06:59.666
Aah!

07:01.176 --> 07:03.542
Oh, Finn, thank
goodness you're here!

07:03.611 --> 07:05.603
There's wolves in my room!

07:05.679 --> 07:07.841
Yeah, I know. I put them there.

07:07.915 --> 07:09.474
Pretty exciting, right?

07:15.388 --> 07:17.323
I'm sorry to do this, Finn,

07:17.390 --> 07:19.950
but until you stop
acting like a psycho,

07:20.026 --> 07:22.086
you are forbidden from entering

07:22.162 --> 07:23.186
The Candy Kingdom.

07:23.263 --> 07:24.891
Farewell.

07:29.401 --> 07:31.336
I don't understand, Marceline.

07:31.403 --> 07:32.928
I tried everything.

07:33.005 --> 07:34.439
I guess she just
doesn't like me.

07:34.506 --> 07:35.337
Shh.

07:35.407 --> 07:38.036
Come on, Finn... a
brainlord like Bonnie?

07:38.110 --> 07:40.078
You'd be bored with
her in a week.

07:40.144 --> 07:42.943
And anyway, I, for one,
think you're pretty great.

07:44.582 --> 07:47.017
I'm sorry it didn't work
out like you wanted.

07:47.084 --> 07:49.519
I'll see you later, I guess.

07:49.587 --> 07:51.885
Marceline.

07:51.955 --> 07:53.048
Of course!

07:53.123 --> 07:54.785
It's been Marceline all along.

07:55.892 --> 07:57.793
Hey, man, I've been
looking for you.

07:57.861 --> 07:59.693
Sorry for acting
like a dweeb before.

07:59.763 --> 08:01.095
Want some leftover spaghetti?

08:01.164 --> 08:03.428
Ah, no, thanks, man. But
I really need your help.

08:03.499 --> 08:04.865

08:33.760 --> 08:37.457
With you, I would walk
down any road, milady,

08:37.530 --> 08:40.125
especially if it
leads to the movies.

08:40.198 --> 08:41.063
Oh, yeah?

08:41.133 --> 08:44.126
No one would want to go to
the movie with... this!

08:49.609 --> 08:51.577
What do you think of me now?!

08:51.643 --> 08:53.635
How do you like your popcorn?

08:53.712 --> 08:55.704
Ugh!

08:55.780 --> 08:57.373
You're starting to annoy me.

08:57.449 --> 08:59.179
Well, then let's
do something fun,

08:59.251 --> 09:00.742
like to go the movies!

09:00.819 --> 09:03.015
Get off me.

09:03.087 --> 09:05.079
Finn, I like you, but...

09:05.155 --> 09:06.155
Headlock!

09:06.223 --> 09:08.021
No! Listen to me.

09:08.092 --> 09:10.254
I'm not gonna go to
the movies with you.

09:10.327 --> 09:13.729
I just don't like you that way.

09:15.398 --> 09:17.867
I'm sorry, Finn. I just...

09:17.934 --> 09:19.402
I don't want to date you.

09:19.469 --> 09:20.698
Date me?

09:20.770 --> 09:22.705
Man, I just want to
go to the movies,

09:22.772 --> 09:24.172
but everybody hates me.

09:24.240 --> 09:27.300
Wait... you don't want me
to be your girlfriend?

09:27.376 --> 09:29.902
Huh? No! Movies!

09:29.978 --> 09:31.776
If you weren't looking
for a girlfriend,

09:31.847 --> 09:33.713
then why were you
romancing it up all day?

09:33.782 --> 09:35.478
'cause Jake said
couples nights have

09:35.550 --> 09:37.314
weird kissing requirements

09:37.386 --> 09:39.911
and romance-initiation
rituals and whatever else.

09:39.987 --> 09:41.979
I didn't really say all that.

09:43.524 --> 09:45.186
Of course I'll go
with you, Finn.

09:45.259 --> 09:47.694
- You will?
- Yeah, as friends.

09:47.762 --> 09:49.094
Of course as friends.

09:49.163 --> 09:50.563
But no tongue.

09:50.631 --> 09:51.996
Ye... what?!

09:57.971 --> 09:59.837
Oh, man, I can't believe

09:59.906 --> 10:01.636
I'm finally going
to see this movie.

10:03.275 --> 10:04.641
Oh, mon cher,

10:04.710 --> 10:07.805
I guess this is goodbye.

10:07.880 --> 10:10.213
No, not goodbye.

10:11.617 --> 10:13.085
Let's say...

10:13.152 --> 10:15.143
farewell!

10:26.831 --> 10:28.264
Ugh!

10:28.332 --> 10:30.233
Couples night sucks!

10:30.300 --> 10:32.360
Marceline, would you
do me the honor

10:32.436 --> 10:34.530
of getting the plop out of here?

10:34.604 --> 10:36.573
There's nothing I'd like more.

10:36.640 --> 10:37.640
Aah!

10:38.842 --> 10:43.108
Nothing can ever tear us apart.

10:43.179 --> 10:45.341
Yeah!
