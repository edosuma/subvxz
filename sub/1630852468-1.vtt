WEBVTT

01:45.240 --> 01:50.910
ONE YEAR EARLIER, IN GERMANY

02:09.460 --> 02:11.590
Delicious, aren't they?

02:12.770 --> 02:14.670
The best in ages.

02:16.440 --> 02:19.530
On Sunday,
I'll go pick more with Gran.

02:48.540 --> 02:49.760
What is it, Daddy?

02:56.940 --> 02:57.940
Heil Hitler!

03:00.350 --> 03:02.410
- Heil Hitler!
- Back inside, please.

03:02.450 --> 03:03.640
Close the door.

03:04.850 --> 03:06.680
Everything's fine.
Close the door.

03:06.720 --> 03:07.690
Close the door.

03:15.000 --> 03:16.590
In the bathroom.

03:20.330 --> 03:22.930
- Take a look.
- See this?

03:31.380 --> 03:32.870
Come on, help me.

03:39.320 --> 03:40.690
Here.

03:42.320 --> 03:44.880
No, we have that. Look.

03:47.490 --> 03:48.690
Here!

03:49.600 --> 03:53.360
We also found communist
propaganda in the bedroom.

04:17.930 --> 04:19.920
Go!

04:21.400 --> 04:23.450
Max, come! Quickly!

04:26.700 --> 04:27.670
Go, go!

04:30.440 --> 04:32.410
Over here!

04:37.040 --> 04:38.410
Shoot!

04:48.020 --> 04:49.490
Shoot!

04:55.460 --> 04:57.160
All the bodies over here!

04:57.400 --> 04:58.890
Yes, Sergeant!

05:01.940 --> 05:03.960
Bring all the bodies here!

05:04.910 --> 05:06.700
Let's go! All the bodies back there!

05:06.740 --> 05:09.470
Shh...

05:13.950 --> 05:17.980
FRANCE, SUMMER 1939

05:21.020 --> 05:23.550
Go on, go on.

05:29.460 --> 05:31.900
Go on, go on.

05:58.160 --> 06:01.130
Hey, don't stack them all
the same way.

06:01.160 --> 06:03.190
They'll tip on the first bend.

06:03.230 --> 06:06.030
Stagger them top to tail.

06:06.070 --> 06:07.530
Don't do that in Belgium?

06:07.570 --> 06:10.160
Sure, only we don't use...

06:10.200 --> 06:11.970
the same stagger.

06:12.010 --> 06:14.600
What do you mean,
the same stagger?

06:16.710 --> 06:18.200
Yes, it's better like that.

06:27.220 --> 06:30.520
Time to eat, I'm hungry.
Let's go around.

06:31.260 --> 06:32.890
Watch.

06:32.930 --> 06:35.020
Come on, Hitler!

06:35.060 --> 06:36.830
Come on!

06:36.860 --> 06:38.260
Stick with me.

06:39.970 --> 06:43.130
Come on, Josephine.
It's time for lunch.

06:51.210 --> 06:52.210
Come on.

06:56.120 --> 06:58.610
Never go behind the horses.

06:59.690 --> 07:01.810
They get feisty with this heat.

07:02.760 --> 07:04.880
Nasty temperament, that one.

07:04.930 --> 07:06.620
That's why we called him Hitler.

07:07.790 --> 07:09.690
The other one is called Charlie.

07:10.730 --> 07:13.000
No, thanks, I prefer water.

07:13.030 --> 07:14.300
- Really?
- Yes.

07:21.140 --> 07:24.870
Beer! It makes some tired.
For me, it's the opposite.

07:39.060 --> 07:40.250
Max.

07:42.630 --> 07:45.000
Here, you have to drink.

07:54.010 --> 07:55.270
You see?

07:55.310 --> 07:59.610
It's like the graveyard
Gran took me to on Sundays.

07:59.650 --> 08:02.640
Max, you must speak French now,

08:02.680 --> 08:05.620
like I taught you, even with me.

08:05.650 --> 08:09.610
It's very, very dangerous
to speak German here.

08:09.660 --> 08:10.660
Understand?

08:20.030 --> 08:22.830
Military graveyards are all the same.

08:28.340 --> 08:32.340
Gran says in graveyards
you can get some peace.

08:38.050 --> 08:40.850
Think we'll ever see Gran again?

08:43.790 --> 08:47.060
The wind-pump was hit bad
by last winter's gales.

08:47.830 --> 08:49.300
I patched it up, but...

08:49.330 --> 08:51.630
How much longer will it last'?

08:51.670 --> 08:55.000
In my opinion,
not through next winter.

08:55.340 --> 08:58.770
Right. It can't wait any longer.

08:58.810 --> 09:02.170
We must equip the water tower
with an electric pump.

09:02.210 --> 09:04.340
Miss Blondel, is there still time

09:04.380 --> 09:08.040
to apply to Arras Prefecture
for a grant?

09:08.080 --> 09:12.420
Well, in late August
they're a bit slow.

09:12.650 --> 09:15.650
We can apply in a fortnight's time,

09:15.690 --> 09:19.420
but it won't be dealt with
before early 1940.

09:19.660 --> 09:22.790
All going well, we should get a grant

09:22.830 --> 09:26.990
to cover 70% to 80%
of the total outlay.

09:27.030 --> 09:31.800
That's all very well,
but it doesn't tell us the end cost.

09:32.410 --> 09:34.930
And you've read the papers.

09:34.980 --> 09:37.710
If war breaks out, like they say,

09:37.740 --> 09:42.080
I don't think our wind-pump
will be a priority for Arras.

09:42.120 --> 09:44.410
They've been talking war for years!

09:44.450 --> 09:46.440
Roger, come on!

09:46.690 --> 09:49.950
I say we just vote
on the issue of the day.

09:49.990 --> 09:54.190
Miss Blondel, note on one side
those for modernity,

09:54.230 --> 09:57.090
and on the other,
those for standing still.

09:58.170 --> 09:59.330
So,

10:00.070 --> 10:02.130
who's for modernity?

10:08.710 --> 10:10.470
Pastis? There you go.

10:14.850 --> 10:16.280
White wine for Albert.

10:17.080 --> 10:18.450
Good, you served the beers.

10:24.220 --> 10:25.220
To the wind-pump!

10:25.260 --> 10:26.450
To the wind-pump!

10:28.730 --> 10:29.960
Cheers!

10:35.440 --> 10:37.840
- Will you dance?
- Mado...

10:37.870 --> 10:39.360
Just to please you.

10:53.420 --> 10:55.450
- Not dizzy?
- A little.

11:05.970 --> 11:07.800
Let me show you.

11:07.830 --> 11:09.180
Just let me play!

11:09.200 --> 11:10.200
Max!

11:16.940 --> 11:18.240
Max.

11:18.980 --> 11:21.110
Come on, time for bed.

11:21.150 --> 11:22.150
Come on.

11:23.120 --> 11:24.210
Come on.

12:13.900 --> 12:15.390
[ Max crying 1.

12:15.440 --> 12:17.340
Daddy!

12:17.370 --> 12:19.170
[ Max crying 1.

12:30.120 --> 12:31.450
Daddy!

12:31.950 --> 12:34.050
3 SEPTEMBER 1939,

12:34.090 --> 12:37.220
FRANCE DECLARES WAR ON GERMANY

12:38.330 --> 12:40.290
Daddy!

12:46.470 --> 12:47.490
Max.

12:47.530 --> 12:50.300
Go away!

12:50.340 --> 12:52.930
Go away!

12:55.310 --> 12:58.970
I want my daddy!

13:00.150 --> 13:02.580
Daddy!

13:05.420 --> 13:11.590
9 MONTHS LATER, MAY 1940

13:23.600 --> 13:25.370
They're here.

13:30.580 --> 13:31.940
I'm ready.

13:39.090 --> 13:40.250
Tag!

13:41.690 --> 13:43.050
Move up.

13:43.090 --> 13:44.490
Come closer.

13:44.520 --> 13:47.260
I had the Prefecture earlier
on the phone.

13:48.500 --> 13:50.460
The Germans
have been at the gates of Arras

13:50.500 --> 13:52.590
since early morning.

13:53.700 --> 13:57.360
Now, we mustn't give in to panic.

13:57.400 --> 14:00.310
The town is defended by the British
like in '14.

14:00.340 --> 14:03.330
And back then, Arras never fell.

14:03.380 --> 14:07.040
The Germans,
it'll take the time it takes,

14:07.080 --> 14:10.380
but we'll send them packing
just like last time!

14:12.390 --> 14:13.680
One year ago,

14:13.720 --> 14:17.280
the Government gave us instructions
in case of invasion.

14:17.990 --> 14:20.720
Each municipality north of Paris
has been told

14:20.960 --> 14:25.330
to evacuate its inhabitants
to host towns further south.

14:25.370 --> 14:28.960
The Prefecture
has now asked us to act,

14:29.000 --> 14:31.400
and it is our duty to do so!

14:33.370 --> 14:38.110
We must go to Dieppe
in Seine-InfÃ©rieure.

14:39.250 --> 14:44.450
We will temporarily abandon
our fields and homes,

14:44.480 --> 14:49.350
and go to Dieppe, calmly,
as we've been asked to do.

14:49.390 --> 14:52.420
They promised a police escort,
where is it?

14:54.560 --> 14:56.620
You know what?

14:56.660 --> 14:58.500
I have faith in this.

14:58.530 --> 15:02.430
I don't need anybody
holding me by the hand.

15:02.470 --> 15:05.460
We can't just up stakes
and leave everything

15:05.510 --> 15:07.700
not knowing what's ahead.

15:07.740 --> 15:09.540
What do you suggest?

15:09.580 --> 15:11.700
We wait here for the Germans

15:11.750 --> 15:14.740
and suffer the trenches,
the bombing, and the gas,

15:14.780 --> 15:16.610
just like in '14?

15:16.650 --> 15:19.640
The Boche are at the gates of Arras!

15:19.690 --> 15:21.520
Before long, they'll be here!

15:23.560 --> 15:25.650
Do as you like.

15:25.690 --> 15:28.590
I have no orders
to force people to leave.

15:28.630 --> 15:32.620
I'm putting no onus on anyone.
Go your own way.

15:39.040 --> 15:40.670
<i>Come, Made.</i>

15:47.650 --> 15:50.340
Go on! Scram!

15:51.350 --> 15:54.410
Go on, scram! Go!

15:57.190 --> 15:58.420
Ah!

16:01.800 --> 16:03.160
Go on.

16:14.810 --> 16:16.440
I'll go pack the car.

16:16.480 --> 16:19.640
We'll hitch it to the wagon
to save petrol.

16:19.680 --> 16:22.170
You won't forget to lock up?

16:22.220 --> 16:23.610
What for?

16:23.650 --> 16:26.480
At least passers-by
won't break the door down.

16:32.130 --> 16:35.120
No, I can't leave that.

16:38.100 --> 16:40.230
And how's the Saint-Emilion doing?

16:44.200 --> 16:48.110
Ripe for drinking, too.
Can't leave it for the Boche!

16:52.210 --> 16:53.300
What about the boy?

17:01.690 --> 17:04.590
Arras was evacuated,
except for the prison.

17:04.620 --> 17:08.820
So the father's
either been killed in the bombing,

17:08.860 --> 17:11.590
or recaptured by the Germans,
which is just as bad.

17:15.600 --> 17:17.900
Take him with you as far as Dieppe.

17:18.670 --> 17:20.900
Bound to be lots
of other orphans there.

17:21.410 --> 17:23.840
Must be some arrangement for them.

17:39.560 --> 17:41.690
Evacuate! Come on!

17:42.600 --> 17:44.150
The alarm! Go!

17:46.170 --> 17:48.530
<i>- Evacuate!
- Come on!</i>

18:26.640 --> 18:28.880
Blimey! I thought
all the civvies had left the town!

18:28.910 --> 18:30.270
No! No! No!

18:30.310 --> 18:32.340
I'm Belgian! I'm Belgian!

18:32.380 --> 18:33.380
Shh.

18:34.580 --> 18:35.960
The Germans are in the tunnels, sir!

18:35.980 --> 18:37.510
Where?

18:37.550 --> 18:40.450
They came down a side tunnel
from the town hall.

18:40.490 --> 18:42.820
Everyone in 4C with me. With me!

18:50.600 --> 18:52.570
Wait! Wait!

19:03.380 --> 19:04.900
Go, go: Go'

19:04.940 --> 19:06.500
Go, go: Go'

19:06.550 --> 19:07.600
Quiet!

19:07.650 --> 19:09.620
Move, move! Quiet!

19:09.650 --> 19:10.650
Shh!

19:23.000 --> 19:25.260
Quickly! Over here!

19:26.600 --> 19:28.260
With me!

19:41.980 --> 19:43.570
Fire at will!

20:02.970 --> 20:04.870
I want to stay here.

20:05.910 --> 20:09.810
My daddy will come
to fetch me, he promised.

20:24.660 --> 20:25.680
When we rebuild,

20:25.730 --> 20:28.020
we'll face the kitchen south
for light.

20:42.810 --> 20:44.370
Come on!

20:58.490 --> 20:59.690
Whoa...

20:59.730 --> 21:03.690
You're right.
First Dieppe, then we'll see.

21:29.060 --> 21:30.520
Very well.

21:30.560 --> 21:32.580
But if you follow me,

21:32.630 --> 21:35.720
we stick together
and you do as I say.

21:35.760 --> 21:37.860
Otherwise, it won't work!

21:37.900 --> 21:39.700
As usual.

21:44.940 --> 21:47.130
Giddy up, Hitler!

21:47.170 --> 21:48.800
Come on!

21:52.780 --> 21:55.510
Come on.

21:55.550 --> 21:56.880
Come on.

22:22.070 --> 22:23.130
Come on.

22:47.770 --> 22:49.060
Quickly!

23:05.620 --> 23:08.250
Hey, hey! This way!

23:14.160 --> 23:15.060
Shh!

23:17.230 --> 23:18.990
They're falling back.

23:19.570 --> 23:21.900
Bring the crates down.

23:21.930 --> 23:23.800
Bring the crates down!

23:24.770 --> 23:26.880
They were just talking
about exploding all the tunnels.

23:26.910 --> 23:28.870
What? How do you know?

23:28.910 --> 23:30.030
Over here!

23:58.670 --> 24:01.610
So, you understand German? Hm?

24:01.640 --> 24:05.010
Who are you?
What are you doing here?

24:05.040 --> 24:06.880
I escaped Germany
several months ago.

24:06.910 --> 24:08.280
I'm an opposition activist.

24:08.310 --> 24:10.080
I thought I found refuge in France,

24:10.120 --> 24:11.680
but I wound up in prison in Arras,

24:11.720 --> 24:13.010
so, now you know.

24:15.960 --> 24:17.790
So, you know your way
around here?

24:18.760 --> 24:19.990
Yeah, a little.

24:20.030 --> 24:22.120
- Are we north or south of Arras?
- South.

24:22.860 --> 24:24.230
Oh, hell.

24:24.260 --> 24:26.290
Why, what difference does it make?

24:28.330 --> 24:31.300
The difference
is the entire British army

24:31.340 --> 24:33.640
moving north from Arras to Dunkirk.

24:33.670 --> 24:37.230
And I'm stuck with a German army
in my bloody way.

24:37.280 --> 24:38.570
- Dunkirk?
- Yes.

24:38.610 --> 24:41.100
So, you're pulling back to England?
Already'?

24:43.650 --> 24:44.810
Good luck.

24:47.250 --> 24:48.250
Where are you going?

24:48.290 --> 24:51.690
A little village
25 kilometers south from here.

24:53.060 --> 24:55.030
I think we should stick to the woods.

24:55.060 --> 24:56.620
Airplanes.

24:56.660 --> 24:57.720
We?

24:59.070 --> 25:00.180
I haven't slept in three days.

25:00.200 --> 25:03.660
I'm tired, and I can't think
of anything else to do.

25:03.700 --> 25:04.670
- What?
- This way.

25:04.700 --> 25:06.070
Get your hands off!

25:14.710 --> 25:16.380
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.

25:17.720 --> 25:18.840
Let's go!

25:25.860 --> 25:28.690
What did you do
to be put in prison?

25:34.030 --> 25:35.260
The French put me in prison

25:35.300 --> 25:38.070
when they found out
I'd lied about my nationality.

25:39.170 --> 25:42.230
They thought I was a spy.

25:42.270 --> 25:43.670
Are you surprised?

25:43.710 --> 25:45.990
I mean, come to think of it,
you could tell us anything you want.

25:46.010 --> 25:48.340
- Look, you're an Englishman.
- Scotsman.

25:48.380 --> 25:49.750
Well, a Scotsman.

25:49.780 --> 25:51.730
I'm not forcing you to listen to me,
or believe me,

25:51.750 --> 25:52.830
and even less, to follow me.

25:52.850 --> 25:53.940
Are we agreed?

26:00.830 --> 26:02.190
Goon!

26:17.080 --> 26:19.370
Go, quickly!

26:19.410 --> 26:21.070
Come on, children!

26:23.880 --> 26:25.080
Goon!

26:31.320 --> 26:33.790
Good boy, Hitler, good boy.

26:37.400 --> 26:39.800
Would you mind being our scout?

26:41.270 --> 26:42.830
Meaning?

26:42.870 --> 26:46.770
Cycle ahead to see if we can join
the main road unhindered.

28:15.430 --> 28:17.190
Council meeting.

28:18.300 --> 28:20.130
Council meeting.

28:24.840 --> 28:26.130
Council meeting!

28:40.550 --> 28:43.020
There are no escorts on the roads.

28:43.060 --> 28:44.110
Can you believe it?

28:44.160 --> 28:46.320
So, we'd best avoid the jams.

28:47.830 --> 28:51.230
I say we take the byways we all know.

28:52.870 --> 28:54.060
Who's against?

28:55.470 --> 28:56.490
No...

28:57.440 --> 29:01.200
Good. They'll have it sorted
when we get to Dieppe.

29:01.240 --> 29:03.000
Let's go!

29:10.050 --> 29:13.420
Goon! Go on!

30:04.300 --> 30:06.170
I wouldn't mind spending
the night here.

30:06.510 --> 30:07.970
A Dim?

30:09.410 --> 30:10.900
Huh?

31:05.360 --> 31:06.530
Paul?

31:07.370 --> 31:08.960
Shh!

31:23.220 --> 31:26.050
We had to leave immediately,
follow the Mayor.

31:26.090 --> 31:27.990
But to go where?

31:30.420 --> 31:33.650
I was more concerned
with which bottles to bring

31:33.690 --> 31:36.020
than to ask where we were going.

31:36.530 --> 31:41.160
Then I woke up
and emerged from my cellar,

31:41.200 --> 31:42.430
they'd all left.

31:43.570 --> 31:45.770
You fell asleep in your cellar?

31:47.040 --> 31:48.040
Mm.

31:50.640 --> 31:53.240
Wait till tomorrow.

31:53.280 --> 31:55.750
By night you're sure to get lost.

31:55.780 --> 31:57.410
It's night for them, too.

31:57.450 --> 31:59.680
They've stopped somewhere to sleep.

32:01.020 --> 32:03.420
- How is Max?
- Good, I think.

32:05.020 --> 32:06.650
He's doing well in school.

32:07.360 --> 32:08.720
So I heard.

32:08.760 --> 32:11.060
- In school?
- Yes.

32:11.100 --> 32:12.760
With Miss Blondel.

32:15.070 --> 32:16.180
Ask him if he's seen

32:16.200 --> 32:18.100
any German or French troops
in the area.

32:18.600 --> 32:21.200
He hasn't, I already asked.

32:21.770 --> 32:22.740
Hm?

32:22.780 --> 32:25.400
Well, then, I don't understand.
Where are the French?

32:25.440 --> 32:28.410
Isn't there any joint command
between your two armies?

32:28.450 --> 32:30.210
I can't believe this.

32:31.480 --> 32:33.470
What? Us fight
under French command.

32:33.520 --> 32:34.490
That's asking...

32:34.520 --> 32:36.300
Well, if you stood up
against Hitler from the start,

32:36.320 --> 32:37.650
we wouldn't be in this mess.

32:39.590 --> 32:42.060
While you diplomatists
were taking tea with the Nazis,

32:42.090 --> 32:44.530
people in Germany were getting killed
and risking their lives

32:44.560 --> 32:46.330
to stop what's going to happen.

32:46.370 --> 32:47.610
I dragged my son into this
for nothing,

32:47.630 --> 32:49.230
and now it's too late, it's too late.

32:49.270 --> 32:51.670
You British and French,
you have no courage.

32:51.700 --> 32:54.640
Who the hell are you
to talk to me about courage?

33:00.350 --> 33:02.140
How about this?

33:05.520 --> 33:08.710
This is a Chateau PÃ©trus, 1908.

33:10.390 --> 33:11.410
Mm.

33:13.360 --> 33:18.460
This is a miracle
in a one-horse village like this.

33:18.500 --> 33:20.660
He's wondering where you got it.

33:20.700 --> 33:22.330
Ah, from my uncle's cellar.

33:22.370 --> 33:27.530
Saved it from the Boche in '14,
so we'll not leave it now! No?

33:29.840 --> 33:31.740
Yes.

34:04.810 --> 34:06.400
Good evening, Mr. Mayor.

34:06.450 --> 34:07.780
Good evening, Edmond.

34:07.810 --> 34:10.750
- Settled in?
- As best we could.

34:10.780 --> 34:11.840
We're here now.

34:12.820 --> 34:14.180
Left everything.

34:15.920 --> 34:18.390
We did right in leaving, Mr. Mayor?

34:20.160 --> 34:22.420
Yes, we did right.

34:24.160 --> 34:25.260
Yes.

34:26.370 --> 34:28.700
- Well, goodnight then.
- Goodnight.

34:37.280 --> 34:41.410
For this first,
somewhat special evening,

34:41.450 --> 34:44.420
the Mayor has decided
to offer you all a drink!

34:44.450 --> 34:47.890
For once the municipality
is paying a round!

34:49.220 --> 34:50.550
Come on.

34:50.590 --> 34:52.250
Don't be shy.

34:53.530 --> 34:54.530
Come on.

34:57.230 --> 34:58.460
Take a glass.

35:01.870 --> 35:03.560
A wee drink?

35:03.600 --> 35:05.330
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes!

35:05.900 --> 35:07.960
Help yourselves.

35:08.210 --> 35:09.900
- There you go.
- Thanks, Mado.

35:10.610 --> 35:12.700
- Cheers, Made!
- My pleasure.

35:12.740 --> 35:15.510
It'll warm you up.

35:17.750 --> 35:19.310
At least they thank you.

35:19.350 --> 35:22.450
True. Everyone thanked me
but you.

35:26.660 --> 35:27.820
Thank you.

35:28.890 --> 35:30.330
Come on.

36:06.000 --> 36:08.330
<i>A bit of hope.</i>

36:08.930 --> 36:10.870
<i>Tonight</i>

36:24.720 --> 36:28.920
Sorry, private party.
No entry, folks.

36:28.950 --> 36:30.580
Where are you from?

36:30.620 --> 36:32.390
LebucquiÃ©re.

36:32.420 --> 36:34.290
I'm from Bucquoy.

36:35.360 --> 36:37.390
Still not possible, madam.

36:39.430 --> 36:40.960
Be off home with you!

36:44.370 --> 36:46.860
Tell me what you think of this.

36:46.910 --> 36:48.810
Thank you, sir.

36:48.840 --> 36:50.740
You're welcome.

36:50.780 --> 36:53.040
- You speak French?
- A little.

36:53.080 --> 36:55.380
I understand it better.

36:55.410 --> 36:59.080
- Where are you from?
- Scotland.

37:00.090 --> 37:01.850
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

37:22.870 --> 37:26.710
My parents hid a Scottish officer

37:26.750 --> 37:30.050
here in this house in 1917.

37:30.080 --> 37:32.980
For almost a year.

37:33.020 --> 37:36.720
And when the village was liberated,

37:36.760 --> 37:40.090
the officer left us his bag-pipes

37:40.130 --> 37:41.650
as a souvenir.

37:41.690 --> 37:43.130
This is Black Watch.

37:44.560 --> 37:46.500
Black Watch.

37:48.700 --> 37:50.900
I wish I could have served with them.

37:53.410 --> 37:58.900
In 1914, my two brothers joined up.

37:58.940 --> 38:01.470
I was still a boy,

38:01.510 --> 38:05.810
and I went to Glasgow
with my mother to see them off.

38:09.450 --> 38:11.860
And that's the last
we ever saw of them.

38:13.130 --> 38:14.820
And now, look at me.

38:16.930 --> 38:20.660
Lost on the continent,
just like them.

38:26.100 --> 38:28.970
My entire company died today.

38:31.910 --> 38:35.710
I've lost 143 men
since the 10th of May.

38:37.480 --> 38:39.470
Always beaten back,

38:39.520 --> 38:43.180
but always with great courage.

38:48.560 --> 38:50.030
To friends departed.

38:50.060 --> 38:51.860
Mm.

39:06.610 --> 39:07.870
[ Baby crying I.

39:23.930 --> 39:25.950
You can sleep with me if you like.

39:27.170 --> 39:28.830
I'm all alone, too.

39:36.510 --> 39:38.140
I can't sleep.

39:47.020 --> 39:48.920
When I want to fall asleep,

39:50.060 --> 39:52.790
I think of something I'd really love.

39:53.790 --> 39:55.760
To see the sea, for example.

40:54.050 --> 40:55.650
Morning, Albert.

40:57.790 --> 40:59.880
That eighth bottle was a mistake.

41:03.330 --> 41:05.820
- Oh. Nine?
- Yes.

41:07.230 --> 41:08.290
All right.

41:14.010 --> 41:15.170
Be right back.

41:15.210 --> 41:17.770
Got to fill another trough
in the village.

41:17.810 --> 41:19.140
All right.

42:22.670 --> 42:23.840
May 7, 1940.

42:23.880 --> 42:26.940
Dear Daddy, they decided to leave.
I'm going, too.

42:26.980 --> 42:29.040
I'll leave you messages
on blackboards.

42:29.080 --> 42:30.910
We're going to Dieppe.
Big kiss, Max.

43:20.170 --> 43:22.000
Hey, the Germans!
The Germans are coming!

43:22.030 --> 43:23.030
<i>- What?
- In here.</i>

43:41.150 --> 43:44.140
They will go away.
They're only scouts.

43:44.190 --> 43:46.210
They're looking for water.

43:46.260 --> 43:48.060
Did the owner of this farm
have a shotgun?

43:48.090 --> 43:49.820
No, no, there's no gun here.

43:49.860 --> 43:52.260
We let them go, no trouble, right?

44:27.300 --> 44:29.230
Hold on, hold on.

44:29.270 --> 44:31.030
What'll you tell them?

44:31.070 --> 44:33.440
That we found English cigarettes?

44:34.470 --> 44:35.870
Come on.

44:36.780 --> 44:38.540
Let's at least take a look.

44:50.390 --> 44:51.550
- Oh, shit!
- All right.

44:51.790 --> 44:52.790
Rule number one,

44:52.820 --> 44:55.230
we always stay apart
on the way to the house.

44:55.260 --> 44:58.530
You go to the barn,
find somewhere to hide. Stay put.

44:58.560 --> 45:00.330
They'll check in the house first.

45:51.020 --> 45:52.480
Cover me.

46:15.910 --> 46:18.310
We should go call for backup.

46:18.340 --> 46:20.000
Stay here.

47:02.420 --> 47:04.620
[clangingl.

47:05.360 --> 47:06.360
Ah!

48:05.380 --> 48:06.480
Hold on.

48:15.060 --> 48:16.120
Receiving.

48:18.460 --> 48:21.690
All is well. Manipulation error.

48:24.070 --> 48:25.470
Understood. Heil Hitler!

48:26.500 --> 48:28.300
How do you know
how to use that thing?

48:29.610 --> 48:32.340
We had a secret radio broadcast
back in Germany.

48:32.380 --> 48:35.710
We were warning people
of the Gestapo, the police raids.

48:37.250 --> 48:38.250
Albert.

48:39.120 --> 48:41.090
Your village is headed for Dieppe.

48:41.120 --> 48:42.450
Will you come with me?

48:44.360 --> 48:46.150
Well...

48:46.190 --> 48:47.780
I never did like to travel.

48:48.030 --> 48:49.690
I'd rather stay here.

48:49.730 --> 48:50.790
I know he's just a scout,

48:51.030 --> 48:53.500
but they'll be swarming here soon
and out for blood.

48:56.200 --> 48:57.400
Come.

48:57.440 --> 48:58.530
And my cellar?

48:58.570 --> 49:00.630
I can get a boat back to England
from Dieppe,

49:00.670 --> 49:02.640
as long as you boys know the way.

49:02.670 --> 49:04.040
Come on!

49:28.730 --> 49:30.100
Percy.

49:30.130 --> 49:30.830
- Percy.
- What?

49:31.070 --> 49:32.710
- Stop the bike for a second.
- What, what?

49:32.740 --> 49:34.430
- Stop the bike for a second.
- What is it?

49:34.470 --> 49:35.620
- What is it?
- I'll tell you later.

49:35.640 --> 49:37.770
- What for?
- You'll see, you'll see.

49:37.810 --> 49:40.340
I'll show you something.
I'll show you something. Come on.

49:40.380 --> 49:43.140
- You see, this is the side.
- Oh, fuck you!

49:43.180 --> 49:44.550
This is it.

49:45.420 --> 49:46.510
You want to win a war,

49:46.550 --> 49:48.820
and you don't even know
how to drive in France?

49:48.850 --> 49:50.580
Ridiculous!

50:55.490 --> 50:57.220
Whoa...

51:00.220 --> 51:01.450
What's the matter?

51:02.430 --> 51:04.260
We take this other road here.

51:05.330 --> 51:07.730
What for? This road is fine.

51:07.770 --> 51:09.600
We do as I say, Mr. Mayor.

51:12.500 --> 51:13.830
Max, come!

51:13.870 --> 51:15.600
Children, groupup!

51:16.610 --> 51:19.300
Come children, gather round!

51:22.650 --> 51:24.480
Come on, hurry up!

51:26.220 --> 51:28.740
Come along, in a group.

51:31.620 --> 51:33.560
Last, as usual.

51:35.690 --> 51:37.920
So, do you all remember

51:37.960 --> 51:40.360
the La Fontaine fable
we learned in school?

51:40.400 --> 51:41.300
Yes!

51:41.330 --> 51:44.830
May we all recite it together?

51:44.870 --> 51:49.740
To show to all your kindness
it behooves:

51:49.770 --> 51:53.230
There's none so small,
but you his aid may need.

51:53.280 --> 51:54.640
Look at me, everyone!

51:59.320 --> 52:01.290
Not too fast!

52:01.320 --> 52:03.580
From beneath the sward...

52:05.220 --> 52:08.820
A rat, quite off his guard,
emerged between a lion's paws.

52:08.860 --> 52:15.530
The beast of royal bearing
showed what a lion he was...

52:16.700 --> 52:18.900
Look at me, Agnes!

52:25.610 --> 52:27.510
Wait for each other!

52:27.550 --> 52:30.780
Forth issuing from his forest glen...

52:30.820 --> 52:31.820
Very good!

52:31.850 --> 52:34.280
In a lion net...

52:34.320 --> 52:36.580
Look at me, Gabriel!

52:36.620 --> 52:38.890
All eyes on me, okay?

53:48.660 --> 53:49.660
Let's go!

54:36.570 --> 54:39.480
Desmaret family
continue towards Poitiers.

54:39.510 --> 54:41.840
Gorzynski family buried
Granny Rosa

54:41.880 --> 54:43.400
behind the church, May 17.

54:48.150 --> 54:52.850
Waiting for you at Amiens station
Jean and Marthe Hombert.

54:57.630 --> 55:02.400
Pruvost Family
lost little Louis, five years old.

55:15.610 --> 55:18.670
I'll go see about supplies.
I'll catch up to you.

55:25.820 --> 55:27.620
- Hello.
- Hello.

55:38.070 --> 55:41.040
We need to buy food, but...

55:41.070 --> 55:42.660
not at this price.

55:42.710 --> 55:44.200
No obligation to buy.

55:45.040 --> 55:46.040
We sell...

55:46.640 --> 55:48.610
so it's not that expensive.

56:12.670 --> 56:14.760
I forbid you to go off like that!

56:14.810 --> 56:16.800
Must I tie you to the wagon?

56:17.510 --> 56:19.480
Don't be angry, Miss.

56:28.490 --> 56:29.490
Are you the teacher?

56:29.520 --> 56:31.680
No, the Red Cross.

56:31.720 --> 56:33.950
These children
have lost their families.

56:34.890 --> 56:37.790
We found them on the roads,
in the fields.

56:37.830 --> 56:40.200
I'm waiting for a truck to Rouen.

56:40.230 --> 56:42.760
Should've been here hours ago.

56:44.200 --> 56:45.930
Is he yours?

56:45.970 --> 56:46.970
Yes.

56:50.210 --> 56:52.640
So, let's see...

57:00.280 --> 57:02.810
I'll check out the school.
Be right back.

57:07.120 --> 57:09.020
Might find some petrol now.

57:12.860 --> 57:15.590
Let's find something to eat.

57:15.630 --> 57:17.600
- All right.
- And drink.

57:50.000 --> 57:51.300
Mute!

57:56.210 --> 57:59.070
There's nothing on the blackboard.
No message.

57:59.110 --> 58:01.670
They didn't come this way,
and we're losing time.

58:20.000 --> 58:22.590
Out! Line up!

58:24.070 --> 58:25.370
On the double!

58:26.940 --> 58:28.170
Be silent.

59:11.820 --> 59:13.370
The prisoners are over here.

59:17.090 --> 59:18.650
Lieutenant,

59:19.160 --> 59:23.680
our mission is to show
how we invaded France,

59:23.730 --> 59:25.220
not a zoo!

59:27.160 --> 59:31.930
To my knowledge, the French army
is not just made up of negroes!

59:31.970 --> 59:34.300
It's all we could find
in the vicinity.

59:34.340 --> 59:37.240
But I sent out an appeal
over the radio.

59:37.270 --> 59:40.300
We'll have white prisoners.

59:41.080 --> 59:42.810
We have lots.

59:45.780 --> 59:46.880
Good.

59:49.390 --> 59:51.820
Line up the negroes
in front of the monument.

59:51.860 --> 59:53.980
All of them!

59:55.930 --> 59:57.790
On the double!

59:59.360 --> 1:00:00.920
Lieutenant.

1:00:05.170 --> 1:00:06.900
Line up!

1:00:07.300 --> 1:00:08.740
Gentlemen!

1:00:09.210 --> 1:00:13.340
You are writing the glorious history
of the Reich,

1:00:13.380 --> 1:00:15.240
of how it rose.

1:00:15.910 --> 1:00:18.110
Our people want to know

1:00:18.150 --> 1:00:21.210
how a thousand year empire
was built!

1:00:21.250 --> 1:00:23.880
It's a propaganda film crew.

1:00:23.920 --> 1:00:25.820
They make movies
that claim to tell the truth

1:00:25.860 --> 1:00:27.480
in every cinema in Germany.

1:00:27.730 --> 1:00:28.420
Goon!

1:00:28.460 --> 1:00:30.930
They're going to reenact
how this village was taken,

1:00:30.960 --> 1:00:33.900
and the French prisoners
are supposed to defend it.

1:00:33.930 --> 1:00:34.990
Will they be armed?

1:00:36.400 --> 1:00:38.300
Yeah, but only with blanks.

1:00:40.870 --> 1:00:42.340
How despicable.

1:00:47.410 --> 1:00:52.870
Look, we found this man stealing food
in one of the houses.

1:00:52.920 --> 1:00:54.320
He's white!

1:00:54.350 --> 1:00:57.050
We could dress him
as a French soldier.

1:01:00.020 --> 1:01:01.860
He's just a looter.

1:01:02.490 --> 1:01:05.090
I want whites, but young ones.

1:01:05.900 --> 1:01:07.800
He's far too old!

1:01:12.270 --> 1:01:13.960
Gentlemen!

1:01:14.000 --> 1:01:15.490
The French army

1:01:15.540 --> 1:01:19.440
sacrificed you
by sending you to fight

1:01:19.480 --> 1:01:21.500
against our Panzers!

1:01:22.350 --> 1:01:26.540
I'm now giving you the chance
to save your skins.

1:01:26.780 --> 1:01:31.280
When I give the signal,
you take a rifle.

1:01:31.320 --> 1:01:34.020
Try to fight with honor.

1:01:36.030 --> 1:01:37.460
Ready?

1:01:44.900 --> 1:01:45.930
Action!

1:01:54.280 --> 1:01:57.410
Spread out
and search all the houses!

1:01:59.150 --> 1:02:00.980
Search all the houses!

1:02:07.090 --> 1:02:10.080
We only have enough food left
for a few days.

1:02:10.130 --> 1:02:13.150
And there's no knowing

1:02:13.200 --> 1:02:15.890
what to expect
between here and Dieppe.

1:02:15.930 --> 1:02:19.060
Now you all know the situation.

1:02:19.100 --> 1:02:20.300
So, we need to decide.

1:02:20.340 --> 1:02:24.370
Sorry, Paul,
but food concerns everyone,

1:02:24.410 --> 1:02:26.210
especially us women who cook it.

1:02:26.240 --> 1:02:28.210
- So, we'll all vote.
- Mado, stop it.

1:02:28.250 --> 1:02:30.370
I don't agree with your proposal.

1:02:30.410 --> 1:02:33.610
But as a woman with no vote,
I have no say?

1:02:34.250 --> 1:02:35.250
Stop it.

1:02:37.450 --> 1:02:39.860
Come on, gather round!

1:02:43.930 --> 1:02:47.120
Those in favor of doing like I said,

1:02:47.160 --> 1:02:48.500
raise your hand.

1:02:52.470 --> 1:02:55.960
Those in favor
of the Mayor's proposal,

1:02:56.010 --> 1:02:57.300
raise your hand.

1:03:17.430 --> 1:03:19.260
So, we do it?

1:03:19.300 --> 1:03:20.420
Let's go.

1:03:38.920 --> 1:03:40.010
Go ahead.

1:03:41.020 --> 1:03:42.380
Where's the store room?

1:03:44.390 --> 1:03:45.450
Move aside.

1:03:45.490 --> 1:03:46.490
Move aside!

1:03:46.520 --> 1:03:48.580
- Do as you're told! Move!
- No!

1:03:48.630 --> 1:03:49.630
Move!

1:03:52.700 --> 1:03:53.700
Well, now.

1:03:59.970 --> 1:04:02.270
Look at this! Here.

1:04:04.710 --> 1:04:07.340
Your behavior is just shameful.

1:04:07.380 --> 1:04:09.470
Your little business relies

1:04:09.510 --> 1:04:12.510
on the roads
to transport your goods!

1:04:13.320 --> 1:04:15.480
On electricity for light and power!

1:04:16.690 --> 1:04:18.450
And who paid for all that?

1:04:20.420 --> 1:04:22.020
We all did!

1:04:22.060 --> 1:04:23.490
With our taxes!

1:04:24.490 --> 1:04:27.460
In times of need,
such selfishness is disgusting!

1:04:29.530 --> 1:04:32.200
Send the bill
to LebucquiÃ©re town hall,

1:04:32.240 --> 1:04:34.470
Pas-de-Calais, Bertincourt canton.

1:04:34.500 --> 1:04:36.560
We always pay our debts.

1:04:52.460 --> 1:04:54.450
Now, you bless yourself.

1:05:05.600 --> 1:05:09.300
Did you too ask forgiveness
for what we stole, Miss?

1:05:09.340 --> 1:05:10.340
Yes.

1:05:11.740 --> 1:05:13.230
Can you wait outside?

1:05:17.680 --> 1:05:21.240
Look. I've written
your first name, Max,

1:05:21.280 --> 1:05:23.580
and my surname, Blondel,

1:05:23.620 --> 1:05:25.420
with the address of our town hall.

1:05:27.690 --> 1:05:29.660
If we ever get separated,

1:05:29.690 --> 1:05:32.090
show this to people, okay?

1:05:33.160 --> 1:05:36.220
I don't want you getting picked up
and placed.

1:05:39.770 --> 1:05:41.530
Come closer.

1:05:52.220 --> 1:05:53.610
She's sweet, Pauline.

1:05:54.320 --> 1:05:55.480
Yes.

1:05:55.520 --> 1:05:57.350
We may get married.

1:05:59.090 --> 1:06:00.490
Spoken to her parents?

1:06:00.520 --> 1:06:02.690
No, it's too early.

1:06:06.330 --> 1:06:07.660
Her parents are very nice.

1:06:09.670 --> 1:06:12.530
If you had to live with them,
I'm sure it'd be fine.

1:06:19.480 --> 1:06:22.740
Yes, but I'll live with my daddy.

1:06:40.260 --> 1:06:41.820
I knew I'd find you here.

1:06:47.370 --> 1:06:49.400
The Republic, trampled upon.

1:06:49.440 --> 1:06:50.630
Look.

1:06:51.640 --> 1:06:53.410
Now, everything will change.

1:06:53.440 --> 1:06:55.570
I should've quit long ago.

1:06:55.610 --> 1:06:57.410
Come off it, Paul.

1:06:57.450 --> 1:06:59.110
At the Dieppe Sub-Prefecture,

1:06:59.150 --> 1:07:00.740
you'll get new instructions,

1:07:00.780 --> 1:07:04.280
and more than ever, Lebucquiere
will need a mayor like you.

1:07:05.390 --> 1:07:08.650
Remember that Post Office calendar

1:07:08.690 --> 1:07:11.220
on the wall in our kitchen?

1:07:11.260 --> 1:07:15.490
Written on it was,
"Do as you please in May".

1:07:16.500 --> 1:07:17.900
I never paid it any heed.

1:07:18.140 --> 1:07:20.900
Yet it's a nice proposal, no?

1:07:21.740 --> 1:07:25.730
Once we get to Dieppe,
I'll have done my mayoral duty,

1:07:25.780 --> 1:07:27.300
but I'm not doing any more.

1:07:27.340 --> 1:07:30.580
The administration there
will take care of everybody.

1:07:31.820 --> 1:07:35.580
What if, in Dieppe,
we took the boat to Canada?

1:07:37.820 --> 1:07:39.590
Never any wars there.

1:07:39.620 --> 1:07:42.390
You could open a cafe,
and I'd farm.

1:07:42.430 --> 1:07:44.390
I heard they need labor.

1:07:46.430 --> 1:07:49.490
You really want to go?
Leave the country?

1:07:50.270 --> 1:07:51.430
Why not?

1:07:52.500 --> 1:07:58.910
Both your parents and mine
were victims of the last war.

1:07:58.940 --> 1:08:02.570
I lost a lung in '17
due to goddamn mustard gas.

1:08:02.610 --> 1:08:05.210
Haven't we given enough
for our country?

1:08:05.250 --> 1:08:09.240
Can't it let us both live in peace

1:08:09.290 --> 1:08:10.380
wherever we like?

1:12:03.190 --> 1:12:05.550
Mama!

1:12:05.590 --> 1:12:06.820
Jacques!

1:12:06.860 --> 1:12:08.690
[ Baby crying I.

1:12:20.640 --> 1:12:22.610
Please!

1:12:23.440 --> 1:12:24.460
Max!

1:12:36.120 --> 1:12:37.610
Mado?

1:12:38.490 --> 1:12:39.790
<i>Made?</i>

1:12:40.560 --> 1:12:41.820
<i>Made?</i>

1:12:51.100 --> 1:12:52.120
I'm okay, Paul.

1:12:52.170 --> 1:12:53.660
[crying I

1:13:00.740 --> 1:13:01.900
Max!

1:13:02.510 --> 1:13:03.510
I'll be okay.

1:13:03.550 --> 1:13:05.670
Max!

1:13:07.680 --> 1:13:09.550
Max!

1:13:13.890 --> 1:13:15.120
Max!

1:13:32.280 --> 1:13:33.610
It's broken.

1:14:12.620 --> 1:14:13.740
May I'_2.

1:14:19.160 --> 1:14:20.160
Um...

1:14:20.660 --> 1:14:22.960
It's on the house.

1:14:26.230 --> 1:14:27.790
Thank you.

1:14:27.830 --> 1:14:29.030
Cheers!

1:14:30.830 --> 1:14:32.320
<i>Dear Daddy,</i>

1:14:32.570 --> 1:14:35.600
<i>we stopped over here to rest.</i>

1:14:35.640 --> 1:14:38.300
<i>Miss is looking after me well.</i>

1:14:38.340 --> 1:14:39.900
<i>She is very kind.</i>

1:14:39.940 --> 1:14:44.350
<i>6 gave a photo of you and me
to Paufine, my sweetheart.</i>

1:14:44.580 --> 1:14:46.880
<i>A big hug-</i>

1:14:46.920 --> 1:14:48.280
<i>Max.</i>

1:15:39.970 --> 1:15:41.210
A British officer

1:15:41.240 --> 1:15:42.860
and a civilian, Captain!

1:15:42.910 --> 1:15:44.000
Bring them here!

1:15:48.140 --> 1:15:49.870
This way!

1:16:04.160 --> 1:16:07.690
Start distributing the ammunition.

1:16:18.010 --> 1:16:20.910
- Who are you?
- Do <i>you...</i> do you speak English?

1:16:20.940 --> 1:16:22.240
Yeah, I speak a little.

1:16:24.850 --> 1:16:26.850
I'm with the Sixth Battalion,
Seaforth Highlanders.

1:16:26.880 --> 1:16:28.850
The Germans dislodged us
from Arras two days ago.

1:16:28.890 --> 1:16:31.880
Since then, I've been making
my way to Dieppe with this man.

1:16:32.390 --> 1:16:34.050
He's a Flemish refugee.

1:16:37.360 --> 1:16:38.760
Okay. Your papers?

1:16:38.800 --> 1:16:40.890
He lost his papers
during the Battle of Arras,

1:16:40.930 --> 1:16:42.800
but I can personally vouch for him,
Captain.

1:16:43.930 --> 1:16:45.030
What, um...

1:16:45.070 --> 1:16:46.800
What are you doing here?

1:16:47.240 --> 1:16:49.470
We are building an anti-tank barrage.

1:16:51.070 --> 1:16:53.340
The panzer division
is headed this way.

1:16:53.380 --> 1:16:54.710
They're coming.

1:16:55.410 --> 1:16:58.850
And you're going to do what?

1:16:58.880 --> 1:17:02.220
Take the brunt of the attack
while other units take their flanks?

1:17:02.250 --> 1:17:04.120
Roughly, yes.

1:17:04.150 --> 1:17:05.380
Captain.

1:17:05.420 --> 1:17:08.290
I know the people
travelling with that van.

1:17:08.320 --> 1:17:09.950
Do you know where they are now?

1:17:09.990 --> 1:17:13.020
We evacuated them.
Attacked by Stukas.

1:17:14.000 --> 1:17:15.430
We helped them bury their dead

1:17:15.470 --> 1:17:18.400
and cross the river Somme
just behind here.

1:17:18.430 --> 1:17:19.960
We intend to blow the bridges.

1:17:20.000 --> 1:17:21.800
Did you bury a child?

1:17:24.210 --> 1:17:25.730
Why do you ask that?

1:17:26.810 --> 1:17:28.210
Where are the graves?

1:18:44.050 --> 1:18:47.490
Your son must have made it
across the Somme with the others.

1:18:50.160 --> 1:18:51.850
And you should get going.

1:18:54.430 --> 1:18:55.520
Come on.

1:18:58.030 --> 1:18:59.060
Come on.

1:19:11.180 --> 1:19:12.910
You're staying here?

1:19:12.950 --> 1:19:16.280
Of course. I always dreamed
of taking orders from a Frenchman.

1:19:17.190 --> 1:19:18.850
Retreating's not for me.

1:19:22.590 --> 1:19:25.490
When you get to Dieppe,
take a boat to London.

1:19:25.530 --> 1:19:27.500
Go to this address.
He's a staff instructor.

1:19:27.530 --> 1:19:29.400
I know him very well.
Tell him I sent you.

1:19:29.430 --> 1:19:32.490
I put my name and number there, too,
but give him this,

1:19:32.540 --> 1:19:34.160
because he gave it to me.

1:19:37.640 --> 1:19:42.240
You can tune into Nazi wavelengths,
you can jam their signals.

1:19:42.280 --> 1:19:44.250
You could spread false information.

1:19:44.280 --> 1:19:45.280
Hit them where it hurts.

1:19:46.220 --> 1:19:47.510
I see that now.

1:19:51.120 --> 1:19:54.020
I have actually learned something
being with you.

1:19:55.090 --> 1:19:58.290
It does take more
than maniacs like me to win a war.

1:20:01.660 --> 1:20:03.630
Just promise me one thing.

1:20:04.430 --> 1:20:08.030
Whatever happens, get to London.

1:20:44.240 --> 1:20:45.970
Go on, go on!

1:20:55.280 --> 1:20:56.410
Quickly!

1:20:56.450 --> 1:20:58.150
Keep it moving!

1:20:58.190 --> 1:20:59.380
Goon!

1:21:01.620 --> 1:21:02.990
Go on! Keep it moving!

1:21:04.360 --> 1:21:07.330
- Go on! Hurry!
- Go on!

1:21:07.360 --> 1:21:09.060
Keep it moving! Quickly!

1:21:09.100 --> 1:21:10.330
Goon!

1:21:12.440 --> 1:21:14.300
Right, everything in place?

1:21:14.340 --> 1:21:16.030
Okay, gents, let's go!

1:21:18.540 --> 1:21:19.600
Quickly!

1:21:19.640 --> 1:21:23.550
No, no, you can't cross, Miss!

1:21:23.580 --> 1:21:25.050
I'm expecting a little boy.

1:21:25.080 --> 1:21:27.680
- We're blowing the bridge!
- There's a boy!

1:21:27.720 --> 1:21:29.650
- I'm sorry, Miss.
- We can't leave Max!

1:21:29.690 --> 1:21:32.020
- It's too late!
- You must evacuate!

1:21:32.050 --> 1:21:33.990
- We can't leave him!
- It's too late.

1:21:34.020 --> 1:21:35.420
Move that cart!

1:21:35.460 --> 1:21:36.460
No! No! No!

1:21:36.490 --> 1:21:37.980
No, no!

1:21:38.030 --> 1:21:39.220
Go on.

1:21:39.260 --> 1:21:41.090
[Suzanne panting 1.

1:21:42.500 --> 1:21:44.490
No, please!

1:21:44.530 --> 1:21:45.430
No!

1:22:30.610 --> 1:22:32.170
Help.

1:22:37.390 --> 1:22:39.050
Help.

1:22:41.420 --> 1:22:42.720
Help me.

1:22:47.630 --> 1:22:49.160
Help me.

1:22:57.470 --> 1:22:59.100
What's your name?

1:23:02.340 --> 1:23:03.680
Your name?

1:23:04.580 --> 1:23:05.780
Name?

1:23:05.820 --> 1:23:07.610
My name is Max.

1:23:09.220 --> 1:23:10.690
You're German?

1:23:11.550 --> 1:23:14.490
You are German.

1:23:15.860 --> 1:23:18.730
Come here, Max.

1:23:18.760 --> 1:23:20.250
Come here.

1:23:20.300 --> 1:23:22.130
Pull on this strap.

1:23:22.160 --> 1:23:24.660
Help me, I'm dying.

1:23:24.700 --> 1:23:26.100
Come.

1:23:26.140 --> 1:23:27.570
Here.

1:23:27.600 --> 1:23:30.660
Come. Pull here.

1:23:31.870 --> 1:23:33.430
Here.

1:23:33.480 --> 1:23:35.500
Here. Come on.

1:23:38.350 --> 1:23:40.340
Ah! Ah!

1:23:43.750 --> 1:23:45.240
[crying I.

1:24:00.470 --> 1:24:01.700
How old are you?

1:24:04.440 --> 1:24:05.870
Eight.

1:24:05.910 --> 1:24:07.170
Eight?

1:24:09.180 --> 1:24:12.240
I have a little boy, too. Johann.

1:24:12.850 --> 1:24:15.150
I won't see him turn eight.

1:24:17.820 --> 1:24:18.820
Here.

1:24:19.590 --> 1:24:21.890
Here, here.

1:24:29.430 --> 1:24:30.800
Take my wallet.

1:24:32.840 --> 1:24:36.470
Give it to the first
German soldier you meet.

1:24:36.510 --> 1:24:39.270
Can you do that for me, Max?

1:24:40.440 --> 1:24:41.530
Yes?

1:24:43.850 --> 1:24:45.540
You promise?

1:25:39.500 --> 1:25:40.590
Ah!

1:26:29.820 --> 1:26:31.450
[crying I

1:28:33.480 --> 1:28:34.700
Max!

1:28:36.010 --> 1:28:37.450
Daddy.

1:29:12.710 --> 1:29:14.480
Like it?

1:29:14.520 --> 1:29:17.580
It's cold, but it's good.
Want some?

1:29:17.620 --> 1:29:18.980
No, thanks.

1:29:21.720 --> 1:29:23.890
MYÂ» hÂ°W YÂ°U'Ve grown!

1:29:25.730 --> 1:29:27.790
I'll have to measure you.

1:29:29.570 --> 1:29:33.630
Leaving messages
on school blackboards...

1:29:33.670 --> 1:29:36.900
What a great idea!

1:29:38.670 --> 1:29:40.840
- It was Miss Suzanne's idea.
- Yeah?

1:29:40.880 --> 1:29:43.000
And this, too.

1:29:46.050 --> 1:29:48.780
Last night, in the hut,

1:29:48.820 --> 1:29:51.910
I was missing her as much as you.

1:30:04.670 --> 1:30:06.000
But you know, Max...

1:30:06.570 --> 1:30:08.800
You don't need that address now.

1:30:08.840 --> 1:30:11.200
LebucquiÃ©re, it's over.

1:30:11.240 --> 1:30:12.670
You understand?

1:30:15.180 --> 1:30:17.700
It's good to speak German, no?

1:30:19.720 --> 1:30:21.080
It's been so long.

1:30:23.220 --> 1:30:26.120
- I spoke with a German yesterday.
- Yeah?

1:30:26.150 --> 1:30:27.210
With Who?

1:30:28.720 --> 1:30:30.720
A German soldier.

1:31:04.190 --> 1:31:06.320
Goon!

1:31:07.000 --> 1:31:08.020
Go, go!

1:31:17.240 --> 1:31:18.800
Whoa...

1:32:15.100 --> 1:32:16.620
[ Girl laughs I.

1:32:28.910 --> 1:32:30.740
Stop here!

1:32:31.250 --> 1:32:32.340
Here.

1:32:39.920 --> 1:32:40.980
Ladies and gents!

1:32:44.730 --> 1:32:47.020
Hello.

1:32:47.900 --> 1:32:49.230
Hello.

1:32:53.200 --> 1:32:54.900
Good day, Madam.

1:32:57.170 --> 1:33:00.010
Look into the camera, please.

1:33:01.210 --> 1:33:02.440
Sir.

1:33:15.160 --> 1:33:16.720
Have a nice day.

1:33:17.430 --> 1:33:19.190
The prisoners are ready.

1:33:19.230 --> 1:33:21.420
- Get the car.
- Yes.

1:33:21.460 --> 1:33:23.330
'Hurry u D! 'Yes!

1:33:26.230 --> 1:33:27.960
Paul, let's go!

1:33:32.010 --> 1:33:34.840
Go on, go on.

1:34:00.240 --> 1:34:01.170
Move it!

1:34:01.200 --> 1:34:03.190
All out, on the double!

1:34:03.240 --> 1:34:05.830
The prisoners between the trees.

1:34:06.340 --> 1:34:08.070
In a half circle.

1:34:20.160 --> 1:34:22.520
Oh, ho, ho.

1:34:22.760 --> 1:34:25.390
What? What?
What are you gonna do with him?

1:34:25.430 --> 1:34:27.330
- You can't even play them, can you?
- Steady.

1:34:27.360 --> 1:34:29.830
- Can you, you stupid bastard?
- Steady!

1:34:29.870 --> 1:34:31.490
Lower your weapon!

1:34:36.440 --> 1:34:38.340
Do you know how to play them?

1:34:39.910 --> 1:34:41.210
Icould.

1:34:41.910 --> 1:34:43.210
What would you give me?

1:34:45.480 --> 1:34:48.880
Eternity... in my film.

1:34:51.250 --> 1:34:53.280
Would you let me keep
my bagpipes?

1:34:53.320 --> 1:34:54.850
Do you have the authority?

1:34:55.260 --> 1:34:57.020
Of course.

1:34:58.260 --> 1:35:00.190
Play for my movie.

1:35:03.930 --> 1:35:05.160
Please.

1:36:04.030 --> 1:36:05.360
Did you enjoy that?

1:36:25.310 --> 1:36:28.870
As we've seen,
the Germans are forging ahead.

1:36:29.550 --> 1:36:32.040
It looks like they're unstoppable.

1:36:32.650 --> 1:36:36.350
It's pointless going on,
they'll be in Dieppe before us.

1:36:37.630 --> 1:36:39.530
The war already seems lost.

1:36:43.230 --> 1:36:45.200
I made a terrible mistake.

1:36:46.500 --> 1:36:50.270
I should never have led you
from your homes into this mess.

1:36:52.140 --> 1:36:55.040
You made the right decision,
we had to leave.

1:36:56.080 --> 1:36:58.380
You saw those tanks!

1:36:58.410 --> 1:37:01.640
Can you imagine
what they've done to our villages?

1:37:03.620 --> 1:37:06.990
And the war can't be lost
in just ten days?

1:37:08.990 --> 1:37:11.430
We haven't come this far for nothing!

1:37:11.460 --> 1:37:14.260
Take us further,
to Poitiers, to Bordeaux.

1:37:14.300 --> 1:37:16.390
They'll never reach Bordeaux.

1:37:16.430 --> 1:37:19.160
I'd love to believe you, Roger.

1:37:20.940 --> 1:37:22.500
If you're up for it, go ahead.

1:37:23.270 --> 1:37:25.570
But me, I'm turning back.

1:37:26.680 --> 1:37:29.700
I'll find a bridge somewhere
and go on home.

1:37:52.030 --> 1:37:53.260
And you, Suzanne?

1:37:54.700 --> 1:37:56.470
I'm going home.

1:37:58.440 --> 1:38:01.540
I stitched the LebucquiÃ©re address
inside his coat.

1:38:02.310 --> 1:38:04.610
One day I'll know
what became of him.

1:38:11.390 --> 1:38:13.620
I must, otherwise it'll be unbearable.

1:38:16.460 --> 1:38:19.160
The only way to keep our grip

1:38:20.060 --> 1:38:23.330
is to return to where we belong.

1:38:23.370 --> 1:38:24.560
Our home.

1:38:26.470 --> 1:38:30.100
The Germans will respect us
if we do our jobs.

1:38:38.280 --> 1:38:40.300
Suzanne is not your daughter, Paul.

1:38:43.080 --> 1:38:44.640
Let her live her life.

1:40:59.220 --> 1:41:00.880
Whoa...

1:41:08.860 --> 1:41:11.830
Why do you want to head north?

1:41:11.870 --> 1:41:16.500
Most of the people we meet
are fleeing south.

1:41:16.540 --> 1:41:19.700
We're returning to our village,
LebucquiÃ©re.

1:41:19.740 --> 1:41:21.840
- I'm the Mayor.
- Ah.

1:41:22.880 --> 1:41:24.500
Give me your papers.

1:41:36.220 --> 1:41:37.850
[Dialing phone 1.

1:41:39.790 --> 1:41:41.270
I have someone here

1:41:41.300 --> 1:41:43.890
who says he is
the mayor of LebucquiÃ©re.

1:41:45.270 --> 1:41:46.930
Is that on your side?

1:41:50.340 --> 1:41:51.600
Uh-huh.

1:41:57.350 --> 1:41:58.610
Go ahead.

1:42:04.550 --> 1:42:06.280
Giddy up, Hitler!

1:42:42.420 --> 1:42:43.730
Max, eyes straight ahead!

1:42:43.760 --> 1:42:45.730
Look at no one!

1:42:53.840 --> 1:42:54.960
Max!

1:43:35.980 --> 1:43:39.000
Step over here.

1:43:44.590 --> 1:43:46.310
I was wounded yesterday,

1:43:46.350 --> 1:43:47.910
I'm re-joining my unit.

1:44:03.000 --> 1:44:04.870
Who are these people?

1:44:06.740 --> 1:44:10.010
They took care of me.

1:44:10.040 --> 1:44:12.480
I'm helping them
to get across the river.

1:44:13.450 --> 1:44:14.680
Uh-huh.

1:44:15.550 --> 1:44:16.710
Papers, please?

1:44:32.700 --> 1:44:33.900
Go ahead.

1:46:47.770 --> 1:46:49.600

1:46:49.640 --> 1:46:53.070
