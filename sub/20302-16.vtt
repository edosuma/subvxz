00:01.001 --> 00:03.503
NARRATOR: <i>In the last episode</i>
<i>of</i> Hill Street Blues…

00:03.586 --> 00:07.465
-Freeze!
-(gunshots)

00:07.549 --> 00:09.300
MAN: Dead before he hit the ground, Frank.

00:09.384 --> 00:11.386
Why don't you just give it
to us verbatim, Weeks?

00:11.469 --> 00:13.930
Well, Lieutenant, as I recall,
I said, "Freeze, niggers,

00:14.014 --> 00:15.223
or I'll blow your heads off."

00:15.306 --> 00:17.851
Those are headhunters, man. Pros!

00:17.934 --> 00:20.645
And at the rate you're going,
they are going to feed you your face.

00:20.729 --> 00:22.355
It was a clean shoot.

00:22.439 --> 00:25.191
They shot at me, and I shot back.

00:25.275 --> 00:27.777
Maybe I've been working
in this junkyard too long.

00:28.945 --> 00:30.864
It's making me mean and angry.

00:32.657 --> 00:34.951
And too ready to fight
with everyone about anything.

00:35.035 --> 00:38.997
-What do you say we just put the board…
-(yells)

00:39.080 --> 00:40.957
Now, look here, lady.

00:41.041 --> 00:43.001
-Now, I'm bigger than you are.
-No, you're not.

00:44.085 --> 00:48.631
-Andy, this is crazy. You know that.
-I don't care.

00:48.715 --> 00:50.133
You wanna tell me what happened?

00:50.216 --> 00:53.178
I got mugged. That's what happened.

00:53.261 --> 00:55.638
I don't like living in a jungle, Frank.

00:55.722 --> 00:58.933
And I don't wanna raise Frank Jr.
in a jungle, either.

00:59.017 --> 01:01.394
I mean, I wanna get out of here.

01:04.647 --> 01:07.484
(indistinct chatter)

01:07.567 --> 01:10.779
Item 15 regards the so-called…

01:11.529 --> 01:13.531
Cutter's Hill,

01:13.615 --> 01:15.617
at the northeast corner of St. James Park.

01:15.700 --> 01:18.119
Night patrol endeavored to break up

01:18.203 --> 01:21.247
an impromptu conga party there
around 3:00 a.m.

01:21.331 --> 01:24.793
and were fired upon, needless to say,
by unfriendlies.

01:25.418 --> 01:27.921
So, now two riot details
from Division remain on the scene.

01:28.004 --> 01:30.632
So, let's pay attention
to that situation out there.

01:30.715 --> 01:33.676
-It's gonna be hot today. Humid.
-(discontented muttering)

01:33.760 --> 01:36.137
Particularly angry,
given the public response

01:36.221 --> 01:38.807
to that officer-involved shooting
four nights ago.

01:38.890 --> 01:40.433
Item 16.

01:41.434 --> 01:44.354
The unauthorized signing-outs

01:44.437 --> 01:47.524
of certain officers of this precinct
by certain other officers…

01:47.607 --> 01:50.193
-MAN: Nobody did that for me.
-…who shall remain nameless.

01:50.276 --> 01:54.114
Ladies and gentlemen,
aside from the obvious impropriety

01:54.197 --> 01:56.783
of said alleged behavior,

01:56.866 --> 02:00.537
there's a disturbing
breach of ethics here as well

02:00.620 --> 02:02.288
that troubles me.

02:02.372 --> 02:03.748
-(drum beating)
-MAN: Hello!

02:03.832 --> 02:06.167
I'm looking for the famous
Sergeant Phil Esterhaus.

02:06.251 --> 02:07.710
Oh, hello to you.

02:07.794 --> 02:10.046
You must be the famous
Sergeant Phil Esterhaus.

02:10.130 --> 02:13.007
Ah, we're gonna really knock off
your-- (foreign word)

02:13.091 --> 02:16.219
-(all laughing)
-Make room! Get ready. Here we go.

02:16.302 --> 02:19.556
-Get ready! Here we go!
-(jingling)

02:19.639 --> 02:21.599
(drum continues)

02:21.683 --> 02:24.310
(cheering)

02:24.394 --> 02:25.937
(trilling)

02:29.149 --> 02:30.316
MAN: Whoo!

02:33.444 --> 02:34.821
MAN: Let's go. Let's go.

02:34.904 --> 02:37.407
-(drum continues)
-(cheering)

02:49.294 --> 02:50.712
(no audible dialogue)

02:58.052 --> 03:00.346
Are you ready, Sergeant?

03:09.689 --> 03:12.901
(yipping)

03:12.984 --> 03:15.445
(police murmuring appreciatively)

03:21.075 --> 03:25.079
(trilling)

03:25.163 --> 03:29.042
(applause, cheering)

03:30.251 --> 03:34.339
Oh, Sergeant. She not through
with you yet, Sergeant.

03:35.006 --> 03:36.466
(laughing)

03:39.260 --> 03:41.596
WOMAN: "Gonna be hot today."

03:41.679 --> 03:45.016
(police murmuring appreciatively)

03:45.099 --> 03:48.770
(drum continues)

03:57.862 --> 04:01.574
(police murmuring appreciatively)

04:04.869 --> 04:07.455
MAN: Pretty cute, huh, Sergeant?

04:07.538 --> 04:09.582
(all cheering)

04:19.634 --> 04:21.302
MAN: Happy birthday!

04:21.386 --> 04:24.097
Happy birthday.

04:24.180 --> 04:29.352
ALL: Ooh! Ooh!

04:31.354 --> 04:32.814
Happy birthday.

04:32.897 --> 04:34.691
(clapping)

04:34.774 --> 04:38.444
MAN: Clap hands. Everybody, please.
Clap hands. Thank you very much.

04:38.528 --> 04:39.779
(trills)

04:41.155 --> 04:44.325
MAN: All right. Here we go. Good-bye.
(continues, indistinct)

04:47.537 --> 04:49.998
All right. All right.

04:54.877 --> 04:57.380
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch. We have a 9-11.</i>

04:57.463 --> 04:59.549
<i>-Armed robbery in progress.</i>
-(sirens whooping)

04:59.632 --> 05:03.261
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner of People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

05:10.518 --> 05:14.439
(theme music playing)

06:10.787 --> 06:12.705
I'm convinced if they wanted
to get ahold of me

06:12.789 --> 06:15.792
they'd call me in the middle of the night,
wake me up, say, "Come to work."

06:15.875 --> 06:17.502
They wouldn't care about my overtime.

06:17.585 --> 06:20.505
-They wouldn't care about anything.
-Whoa, whoa. Hey. What is that?

06:20.588 --> 06:22.632
-What?
-Rhonda do that to you last night?

06:22.715 --> 06:25.551
(scoffing): Rhonda? Uh-uh.
We're talkin' a new team now.

06:25.635 --> 06:27.804
Wait. Vanessa. Your neck.

06:27.887 --> 06:29.389
Tammy. Tammy.

06:31.182 --> 06:34.852
Oh, no. Not Sandra Pauley. Cowboy, please.

06:34.936 --> 06:37.522
Oh, she is the finest woman
I ever met in my life.

06:37.605 --> 06:38.898
Bright and educated.

06:38.981 --> 06:41.484
You know, she's going for
her Ph.D. in English lit.

06:41.567 --> 06:43.861
And refined. She's the only woman I know

06:43.945 --> 06:46.781
who can speak French to me
without me wanting to punch her out.

06:46.864 --> 06:50.034
If I was a less secure type,
I'd wonder what she saw in me.

06:50.118 --> 06:53.121
What? What? What?
I told you I'd see you later.

06:53.204 --> 06:54.414
Get out of here.

06:55.164 --> 06:56.916
Your sensitivity, no doubt.

06:56.999 --> 06:58.668
-No doubt.
-No doubt.

06:58.751 --> 07:01.212
You bet I cut him!
Dude stole my deck chair, man!

07:01.295 --> 07:04.006
MAN: You don't need no picture.
You need a smack upside your head.

07:04.090 --> 07:06.342
Happy birthday, Sarge.
Another year down the drain.

07:06.426 --> 07:07.468
Hey, Phil.

07:07.552 --> 07:10.346
(laughing):
Some physique on that woman, huh?

07:10.430 --> 07:12.807
Well-rounded and supple.

07:12.890 --> 07:15.143
And the way she moved it.

07:15.226 --> 07:17.145
Under other circumstances, Ray,

07:17.228 --> 07:20.356
I might've shared
your appreciation of her musculature,

07:20.440 --> 07:24.068
but as it is, I was embarrassed
in the extremis.

07:24.152 --> 07:27.405
-Embarrassed?
-I'm a basically shy man, Ray.

07:27.488 --> 07:30.241
-FURILLO: Happy birthday, Phil.
-Francis, uh,

07:30.992 --> 07:34.996
do you know who's responsible
for that blatant ribaldry downstairs?

07:35.872 --> 07:37.331
No. I really don't, Phil.

07:38.249 --> 07:40.585
Probably a bunch of guys
took up a collection.

07:40.668 --> 07:41.794
Ask around.

07:45.506 --> 07:48.259
-Mmm. Say, lover.
-Hmm?

07:48.342 --> 07:50.219
Did you get the car
in the shop for new brakes?

07:50.303 --> 07:51.929
No. I gotta get it to the garage at 8:30.

07:52.013 --> 07:54.015
-They said it'll be ready around 3:00.
-Oh, man.

07:54.098 --> 07:55.725
How are we gonna get around until then?

07:55.808 --> 07:58.936
Hey. Relax, will ya, man? Clark's out
with phlebitis. We'll take his unit.

07:59.020 --> 08:00.646
Yeah. Yeah. Hello. Hello.

08:00.730 --> 08:02.857
Jennifer Crosby pick up her messages yet?

08:03.608 --> 08:07.612
Okay. Tell her John LaRue called again.
Call me. It's important. Right.

08:08.738 --> 08:10.615
Sarge, are these all my messages?

08:10.698 --> 08:12.492
What you see is what you got.

08:14.452 --> 08:16.287
-A moment, fellas.
-Sure, Sarge.

08:16.370 --> 08:19.248
Uh, that little performance in roll call--

08:19.916 --> 08:21.334
Tell the truth.

08:21.417 --> 08:23.044
Did you boys cook it up, huh?

08:23.127 --> 08:25.379
-(laughing): Uh-uh.
-No.

08:25.463 --> 08:27.924
My taste runs more
to your double-decker bump and grind,

08:28.007 --> 08:29.050
if you get my thrust.

08:30.092 --> 08:31.093
MAN: Whoo!

08:31.177 --> 08:34.555
MAN 2: Whoa. Hey, Fay. Lookin' good.

08:34.639 --> 08:36.307
MAN 1: Ooh! Ooh!

08:36.807 --> 08:38.851
Caribbean or Puerto Vallarta sounds nice.

08:38.935 --> 08:41.521
-(door opens)
-But Bora-Bora? Sounds redundant.

08:42.563 --> 08:44.398
Uh-oh. Listen. I gotta go, Counselor.

08:44.482 --> 08:46.817
Could we talk about this over dinner? Hmm?

08:46.901 --> 08:51.155
Sure. 7:30. Right. Yeah. Yes. Bye.

08:52.782 --> 08:55.451
Fay, you look spectacular.

08:55.535 --> 08:56.619
Thank you.

08:58.329 --> 09:00.206
-How's the thumb?
-It feels great.

09:00.289 --> 09:01.374
You know, getting mugged

09:01.457 --> 09:04.210
is the best thing that's happened
to me since our divorce, Frank.

09:04.293 --> 09:07.922
-Gee, thanks.
-Oh, come on. Don't be so sensitive.

09:08.005 --> 09:09.465
I mean, what I mean is it--

09:10.007 --> 09:13.135
it sort of made me come face-to-face
with my own mortality.

09:13.219 --> 09:15.680
-You have no idea what a rut I was in.
-Yes, I have.

09:15.763 --> 09:19.058
What with my work
and motherhood and Harvey.

09:19.141 --> 09:20.768
By the way, that ship has sailed.

09:20.851 --> 09:22.812
I mean, you were so right
about him, Frank.

09:22.895 --> 09:26.566
He is. He is humorless.
He's arrogant. He's pedantic.

09:26.649 --> 09:30.236
-I mean, he has chronic dermatitis.
-(chuckles)

09:30.319 --> 09:32.280
-What's so funny?
-You.

09:33.155 --> 09:35.116
I've never seen you so up.

09:35.199 --> 09:37.201
-Well, it's Otis.
-Otis?

09:38.953 --> 09:40.037
Redman?

09:41.163 --> 09:42.123
Your orthopedist?

09:42.206 --> 09:44.750
Well, he's much more than my orthopedist.

09:44.834 --> 09:46.168
How much more?

09:46.961 --> 09:50.756
Well, uh, we went to the basketball game
and had soul food the other night.

09:50.840 --> 09:52.717
Last night it was dinner and the theater.

09:52.800 --> 09:54.719
I'm having lunch with him
today at Café Olé.

09:54.802 --> 09:56.929
This guy gives new meaning
to the word "operate."

09:57.013 --> 09:59.307
Don't you think you're moving
this a little briskly?

09:59.390 --> 10:01.642
And aren't you being a little paternal?

10:02.852 --> 10:05.563
You're right. It's none of my business.
I apologize.

10:05.646 --> 10:07.690
Oh. Never mind. Listen.

10:07.773 --> 10:09.817
What I came here for is to find out

10:09.900 --> 10:12.069
whether you can take
Frank Jr. for the weekend.

10:12.820 --> 10:15.281
-The whole weekend?
-Well, see, Otis has invited me

10:15.364 --> 10:17.992
to go to an orthopedic convention
in St. Louis.

10:18.075 --> 10:21.704
I mean, it's not Bora-Bora,
my dear, but, uh--

10:21.787 --> 10:23.289
Fay, are you sure about this?

10:23.831 --> 10:24.749
Honestly?

10:25.625 --> 10:26.917
No.

10:27.001 --> 10:28.085
But, um,

10:28.919 --> 10:32.465
I'm very flattered, and I'm very excited.

10:33.215 --> 10:34.925
And I have to admit, I'm a little curious.

10:35.009 --> 10:36.552
I'd hate to see you get hurt.

10:36.636 --> 10:41.182
Frank, getting hurt is part of life.

10:41.265 --> 10:42.558
Come on. Will you take him?

10:43.684 --> 10:45.519
-Sure.
-Oh!

10:45.603 --> 10:47.521
Great. Thank you.

10:47.605 --> 10:50.066
-Francis, your-- Oh. Excuse me.
-Hi, Phil.

10:50.941 --> 10:52.401
Well, hello, Fay.

10:52.485 --> 10:55.696
Wow. What an attractive ensemble.

10:56.656 --> 10:58.532
-Thank you.
-Hmm.

10:59.325 --> 11:01.035
-Bye, Phil.
-Bye.

11:02.745 --> 11:04.330
Ooh. Nice scent.

11:05.289 --> 11:06.457
-Ooh.
-Phil.

11:06.540 --> 11:09.293
Oh. Excuse me. You're gonna be late
to your meeting with the chief.

11:17.426 --> 11:20.388
-Frank!
-WOMAN (over P.A. system): <i>Frank Furillo.</i>

11:20.471 --> 11:22.765
<i>Captain Frank Furillo,</i>
<i>you have a phone call.</i>

11:22.848 --> 11:25.142
<i>Pick up on the courtesy phone, please.</i>

11:30.189 --> 11:31.691
-Furillo.
-Yeah, Captain.

11:31.774 --> 11:33.567
We picked up Pinky Reiner on Utica

11:33.651 --> 11:35.528
and tailed him to the Bixby Hotel.

11:35.611 --> 11:37.863
<i>-You know the place.</i>
-Yeah. Very interesting.

11:37.947 --> 11:40.700
Yeah. Weeks's story is lookin' stronger.

11:40.783 --> 11:43.577
Okay, Neal. Good work.
Stay with him, but be patient.

11:43.661 --> 11:45.371
Yeah. I know what you mean, Captain.

11:45.454 --> 11:46.622
Don't worry.

11:46.706 --> 11:47.748
Yeah. Later.

11:49.625 --> 11:51.168
Hey. Make it quick, J.D.

11:58.050 --> 11:59.927
Yeah. Hi. Uh, this is J.D. LaRue again.

12:00.010 --> 12:02.555
Did, uh, Jennifer Crosby
pick her messages up yet?

12:03.347 --> 12:05.558
Oh. What time's her flight due in?

12:07.101 --> 12:11.397
Okay. Look. Tell her she can call me
anytime tonight after she gets in. Okay?

12:11.480 --> 12:14.942
Hey. You know, you got a dynamite voice.
Uh, you an actress or somethin'?

12:15.693 --> 12:17.945
Oh, no. I-- I'm in law enforcement.

12:19.155 --> 12:20.948
No, no. Jennifer's been doing

12:21.031 --> 12:22.908
a little undercover work for me.
That's all.

12:24.493 --> 12:25.619
Huh?

12:26.704 --> 12:27.830
What's your name?

12:28.748 --> 12:31.751
Tiffany. Tiffany. Hey. That's great.

12:31.834 --> 12:34.336
-Come on. He's splittin'.
-Hold on a second, Tiffany. Okay?

12:34.420 --> 12:37.298
Look. I gotta get the car
to the garage anyway. Okay? So you go on.

12:37.381 --> 12:40.718
I'll find out your location from Dispatch.
I'll hitch a ride out.

12:41.260 --> 12:43.220
Yeah, baby. No, nothin'. Just a friend.

12:43.304 --> 12:44.972
Right. Huh?

12:45.055 --> 12:46.640
Me? No. I'm not doing anything.

12:46.724 --> 12:49.101
-(engine starts and revs)
-(tires squeal)

12:49.185 --> 12:51.395
Hey, if she's not there later tonight…

12:51.479 --> 12:52.855
(tires squealing)

12:52.938 --> 12:55.941
What do you think, baby?
Maybe, uh, you and I could, uh,

12:56.025 --> 12:58.569
catch a little dinner sometime soon, huh?

12:58.652 --> 13:01.405
(laughing): Hey!

13:01.489 --> 13:02.615
Can't shake you.

13:02.698 --> 13:04.992
Ah. You thought you had me,
didn't ya, huh?

13:05.075 --> 13:05.951
Yes, sir.

13:06.035 --> 13:08.996
(panting): You really pulled
those last 6 points out there at the end.

13:09.079 --> 13:12.458
Hello, Frank. Glad you could make it.
You know Lieutenant Digby out of Division?

13:12.541 --> 13:14.460
-Sure. We've met. Good game.
-Captain.

13:14.543 --> 13:16.337
-He's a tough competitor.
-MAN: My head!

13:16.420 --> 13:18.756
But you gotta go some to beat
the old fox at the wire, huh?

13:18.839 --> 13:20.341
-My head!
-Yes, sir.

13:20.424 --> 13:23.052
Well, if you'll excuse me,
I'm gonna go hit the showers, Chief.

13:23.135 --> 13:24.720
-See ya, Digby.
-Captain.

13:24.804 --> 13:28.641
-Take it easy. I can't--
-Just keep walking.

13:28.724 --> 13:30.392
I'm dizzy.

13:30.476 --> 13:32.895
-Uh--
-Doggone fiberglass.

13:32.978 --> 13:36.190
It doesn't have the tensile strength
of a good steel racquet.

13:36.273 --> 13:38.108
Howard, is that man all right?

13:38.943 --> 13:41.987
Sure, Frank. He just got a little close
to my backswing. That's all.

13:42.071 --> 13:44.448
A dozen stitches, and the old melon
will be as good as new.

13:44.532 --> 13:47.451
You ought to try this game, Frank.
It really centers you.

13:48.035 --> 13:49.787
-Yeah. I see that, Howard.
-(sighs)

13:49.870 --> 13:52.039
You could use some exercise, Frank.

13:52.122 --> 13:53.624
Lose some weight.

13:53.707 --> 13:56.544
Color's a little pasty. Jowly too, huh?

13:56.627 --> 13:58.462
Tighten up the old breadbasket.

13:58.546 --> 14:01.257
I'll teach you the rudiments of the game.
You just say the word.

14:01.340 --> 14:03.717
Thanks, Howard. If time allows.

14:03.801 --> 14:06.303
Well, let me shower up,
and we'll put on the feed bag, okay?

14:06.387 --> 14:09.014
Come on, Howard. Last one in the shower
has to hold the soap.

14:09.098 --> 14:10.599
-(laughs)
-(chuckles)

14:13.310 --> 14:15.354
MAN: Would you like some cheese?

14:15.437 --> 14:19.358
No point in dancing around it, Frank.
I'm feeling heat on this one.

14:19.441 --> 14:22.778
The mayor's office,
community action groups,

14:22.862 --> 14:24.864
Black Citizens Coalition on the Hill--

14:24.947 --> 14:27.950
-They all want Weeks's head on a pole.
-I appreciate that, Chief.

14:28.033 --> 14:30.411
Then damn it, Frank. Why the delay?

14:31.704 --> 14:33.956
Too many questions, not enough answers,

14:34.039 --> 14:36.876
and a feeling down in my gut
that, as rotten as he is,

14:36.959 --> 14:39.378
Weeks is telling the truth this time.

14:39.461 --> 14:42.631
I'm deeply troubled, Frank. You know why?

14:43.382 --> 14:46.427
Because when the president announced
his intention to visit the Hill,

14:46.510 --> 14:49.096
you were conspicuous
by your lack of enthusiasm.

14:49.889 --> 14:52.099
And when you had the opportunity
to promote yourself

14:52.182 --> 14:55.394
off the Hill and up to commander,
you literally gave it away.

14:55.477 --> 14:57.271
Now you're at it again.

14:57.354 --> 15:00.649
And given Weeks's history
of racial bias leading to incident,

15:00.733 --> 15:04.028
your concern for his welfare
mystifies me, Frank.

15:04.111 --> 15:07.781
My concern for Weeks
is the same as for any other cop

15:07.865 --> 15:09.825
involved in a shooting incident:

15:09.909 --> 15:11.660
that he have a thorough investigation

15:11.744 --> 15:15.497
before he goes before a Board of Rights
or a coroner's inquest.

15:15.581 --> 15:19.335
Weeks is not like any other cop, Frank.
He's a liability.

15:20.044 --> 15:22.129
A disgrace to the entire force.

15:22.588 --> 15:24.298
If we don't make an example of him,

15:24.381 --> 15:27.051
it'll do irreparable damage
to this department's image.

15:27.134 --> 15:30.304
Chief, you already know
I'm not a political person.

15:30.387 --> 15:31.764
I'm also not naive.

15:31.847 --> 15:34.016
I've been known to bend a rule or two.

15:34.099 --> 15:38.354
But this is asking me to place
image above morality. I can't do that.

15:38.437 --> 15:40.356
Bottom line, Frank.

15:40.439 --> 15:43.150
It's not image or politics or morality.

15:43.233 --> 15:44.401
It's perception.

15:44.485 --> 15:46.236
If Weeks gets away with this shooting,

15:46.320 --> 15:49.323
righteous or not, the entire community
will perceive cover-up.

15:49.406 --> 15:51.659
They will scream cover-up.

15:51.742 --> 15:55.329
And while we're busy defending ourselves,
someone will drop a match up there,

15:55.412 --> 15:57.915
and you'll have a full-blown riot
on your hands.

15:58.749 --> 16:00.501
Where's the morality in that?

16:05.089 --> 16:06.715
You want to get married, Lucy?

16:06.799 --> 16:08.133
I can't today, Joe.

16:09.510 --> 16:11.261
You know, I was there once.

16:11.345 --> 16:13.681
That is the quickest way
to ruin a good relationship.

16:14.640 --> 16:16.767
I'm not sure I'm the domestic type either.

16:17.851 --> 16:20.980
But that does not mean
that I'm into your basic one-night stands.

16:21.063 --> 16:23.273
Hey. I know what you mean.
I'm the same way.

16:24.483 --> 16:26.318
You need a certain kind of, uh,

16:26.402 --> 16:28.445
intimacy I guess you'd say

16:28.529 --> 16:31.407
-in order for, uh--
-Joe, you want to check that out?

16:32.199 --> 16:34.243
(action music playing)

16:50.009 --> 16:52.136
COFFEY: How you doin'? What's happenin'?

16:52.219 --> 16:56.807
-Nothin'. There ain't nothin' happening.
-Wait a second. What are you doing?

16:56.890 --> 17:00.227
Puttin' these tires in the trunk
of the car here, chuck meat.

17:00.310 --> 17:03.272
-Yeah. I can see that. Are they yours?
-No. They're my Uncle Sidney's.

17:03.355 --> 17:05.524
-That's his truck.
-Wait a second. Fellas.

17:05.607 --> 17:09.153
Before I make a hasty judgment, why don't
one of you just tell me what's going down?

17:09.236 --> 17:11.864
We gotta take these tires
we're borrowin' from Sidney's truck

17:11.947 --> 17:14.074
and put 'em on my truck,
so I can drive to the airport

17:14.158 --> 17:15.868
and pick up my mom comin' in from Atlanta.

17:15.951 --> 17:19.121
Does anybody here have proof
of ownership of this truck?

17:19.204 --> 17:20.664
Callin' us liars, huh?

17:20.748 --> 17:22.332
You think we're lying?

17:23.375 --> 17:24.793
Why don't you jump back in--

17:24.877 --> 17:27.546
in your police car, white lady,
before something happens here.

17:27.629 --> 17:30.674
-Hey. Just a second--
-Don't, "Just second, son," me.

17:30.758 --> 17:31.967
I ain't your son.

17:32.051 --> 17:34.720
-Ain't nobody here your son.
-Lucy, why don't you get in the car?

17:34.803 --> 17:36.555
-I can handle--
-Get in the car and radio

17:36.638 --> 17:37.848
for some backup. All right?

17:37.931 --> 17:40.517
MAN: Better remember where you are!
This is my neighborhood!

17:40.601 --> 17:42.686
All right. Get away from the car.

17:43.896 --> 17:45.522
(man shouts)

17:45.606 --> 17:47.941
-(shouting)
-COFFEY: All right. Let her through.

17:48.025 --> 17:50.360
Back off now. Back off, pal.

17:50.444 --> 17:52.071
Back off.

17:52.154 --> 17:54.198
(all shouting)

17:56.658 --> 18:00.287
This is Unit 2203
requesting immediate backup

18:00.370 --> 18:02.289
for officers in distress.

18:02.372 --> 18:03.582
(racket)

18:03.665 --> 18:06.627
-Lock the doors.
-The 1400 block of Jefferson Avenue.

18:06.710 --> 18:07.795
(glass shatters)

18:11.423 --> 18:14.593
(banging)

18:15.427 --> 18:17.304
Damn it, Artie. Take it easy.

18:17.387 --> 18:19.264
It's only a firecracker.

18:19.348 --> 18:21.350
(cheering)

18:21.433 --> 18:23.060
Now put it away.

18:23.143 --> 18:24.812
(jeering)

18:25.395 --> 18:28.732
Hey, Lucy. Why don't you go wait
in the truck? We're almost finished here.

18:28.816 --> 18:30.067
I'm all right.

18:30.901 --> 18:32.736
MAN: Just get it out of here.

18:34.196 --> 18:35.322
Hey, Vinnie.

18:37.491 --> 18:40.661
I don't mean to rush ya, but there are
a lot of places I'd rather be than here.

18:40.744 --> 18:42.496
What do you think?
I really like it up here?

18:42.579 --> 18:44.790
I didn't want this job in the first place.

18:44.873 --> 18:47.584
-(people shouting)
-(glass shatters)

18:53.507 --> 18:57.052
-(man shouting in Spanish)
-MAN 2: Yeah.

18:57.136 --> 18:59.721
You can play it as cool as you want,
Bobby, but I'm kind of tired

18:59.805 --> 19:03.642
of sittin' idly by while crowds
of complete strangers yell insults at me.

19:03.725 --> 19:06.812
Not to mention what that guy with the comb
in his bush said about my mother.

19:06.895 --> 19:08.814
Don't think
I didn't see you looking at him

19:08.897 --> 19:11.233
when that guy said to you
something about being an Oreo.

19:11.316 --> 19:12.568
-(radio chatter)
-Drop it.

19:12.651 --> 19:14.236
-If I want a replay--
-You hear that?

19:14.319 --> 19:16.822
That's Shirret Anders's address.
I'm not going over there.

19:16.905 --> 19:18.699
-You get none of--
-Just drive there, man.

19:18.782 --> 19:20.659
-You--
-Just drive!

19:20.742 --> 19:23.328
(theme music playing)

19:37.092 --> 19:38.760
(people shouting angrily)

19:44.892 --> 19:46.518
I just want to show you somethin' here.

19:46.602 --> 19:48.187
This water been falling down my…

19:48.270 --> 19:50.522
I don't even know
how to turn the water off.

19:50.606 --> 19:52.691
-Hey.
-(all talking at once)

19:52.774 --> 19:55.360
-Look at that thing. It's gonna flood.
-Can you believe this?

19:55.444 --> 19:57.196
Someone could have been electrocuted.

19:58.322 --> 20:01.366
-Your whole house--
-Don't even bother askin' me.

20:01.450 --> 20:04.203
Would someone just stay here
for an hour at the most?

20:04.286 --> 20:06.788
I can't take care of them children.
I got a family of my own.

20:06.872 --> 20:08.457
RENKO: Hey. Where you goin', lady?

20:08.540 --> 20:10.167
This'll be the last time, lady.

20:10.250 --> 20:12.628
Until the welfare people pick 'em up.

20:12.711 --> 20:15.714
If you think she's gonna be
at the Holland House Bar, she ain't there.

20:15.797 --> 20:17.591
Well, where in the hell is she then?

20:17.674 --> 20:21.053
Well, honey, if she can't tell ya,
I sure can.

20:21.136 --> 20:22.721
(knocking)

20:25.766 --> 20:28.227
-I heard you the first time.
-Is Shirret Anders here?

20:28.310 --> 20:30.020
-Sorry, fellas. Wrong pad.
-She's here.

20:30.103 --> 20:32.189
Hey. You can't come bustin'
into no pad like that.

20:32.272 --> 20:33.565
What are y'all doin'?

20:33.649 --> 20:35.067
I was wrong about you, Shirret.

20:35.150 --> 20:37.319
-Put on your clothes. I'm booking you.
-(shouting)

20:37.402 --> 20:39.154
-Shut up.
-I have to go home to my babies.

20:39.238 --> 20:41.907
-The welfare people are taking them.
-Don't take my babies.

20:41.990 --> 20:44.451
-I don't know nothin' about no babies.
-Shut up, Leon.

20:44.534 --> 20:47.120
You're a liar. You ought to be ashamed--

20:47.204 --> 20:49.623
-Put on your clothes. Shut up, Leon.
-Hey!

20:49.706 --> 20:51.917
-Shut up!
-Hey! Hey, hey!

20:52.000 --> 20:54.753
Hey! Hey! Hey, man. Now stop.
You're way out of line here now.

20:54.836 --> 20:56.505
Come on. You're gonna kill him. Stop it.

20:56.588 --> 20:58.757
Let me go. (panting)

20:58.840 --> 21:00.550
Get out of here, man.

21:00.634 --> 21:02.219
(panting)

21:04.805 --> 21:05.806
(horn honks)

21:06.682 --> 21:09.184
MAN: Hey! Taxi! Cabbie, right here!

21:14.815 --> 21:16.608
Didn't faze you a bit today, did it?

21:17.901 --> 21:19.945
-What?
-Today.

21:21.697 --> 21:23.073
Yeah. It did.

21:23.615 --> 21:24.783
It did, huh?

21:27.077 --> 21:29.246
Look, I want to be honest
with you about something.

21:29.329 --> 21:31.873
-What? Yeah?
-I had one thing on my mind out there.

21:31.957 --> 21:34.793
And that was getting you
the hell out of there to a safe place.

21:34.876 --> 21:36.962
Joe, what are you talkin' about?

21:38.005 --> 21:39.923
-Joe.
-Listen to me.

21:41.633 --> 21:44.761
-Lucy.
-Joe, there are people here. Come on.

21:45.387 --> 21:46.471
I don't care.

21:48.473 --> 21:50.559
I got something real strong for you, Lucy.

21:51.643 --> 21:53.228
I want to-- I want to watch out for ya.

21:53.312 --> 21:54.938
I want to be with ya.

21:56.106 --> 21:58.233
I really want to make it with you, Lucy.

22:01.945 --> 22:03.447
Come on. Don't kid around. I--I--

22:04.281 --> 22:05.490
-Look--
-It's not funny.

22:05.574 --> 22:07.492
It's not meant to be funny, Lucy.

22:07.576 --> 22:08.785
Come on. Joe.

22:13.373 --> 22:14.291
MAN: Waitress.

22:20.422 --> 22:22.591
Look, I--I don't want you
to misunderstand me.

22:22.674 --> 22:24.343
Because I'm not trying to pressure you.

22:24.968 --> 22:27.346
-I'm just telling you like it is.
-Okay.

22:27.429 --> 22:28.764
Okay.

22:29.389 --> 22:31.224
If I don't turn you on,
I don't turn you on.

22:32.809 --> 22:35.771
I don't think
that I'd kick you out of bed.

22:36.688 --> 22:38.065
If you know what I mean.

22:41.109 --> 22:43.070
That's a handy coincidence then.

22:43.737 --> 22:44.905
What?

22:44.988 --> 22:47.699
Well, this place.
You know, bein' a hotel and all.

22:50.369 --> 22:53.372
I don't believe it.
That's just what people think.

22:53.455 --> 22:55.874
You know, you partner up with a woman,
and then right away,

22:55.957 --> 22:57.793
wham, bam, automatic.

22:58.251 --> 22:59.669
I know what the guys say.

23:01.505 --> 23:03.090
Well, what difference does it make

23:03.173 --> 23:05.092
if that's what they already think?

23:05.175 --> 23:07.260
Hey, listen. That's not a reason.

23:07.344 --> 23:09.096
Not if you want what I want.

23:09.179 --> 23:11.348
(horn honking)

23:16.353 --> 23:19.022
It's gonna affect our work out here.
You know that. I know it.

23:19.106 --> 23:21.483
I'm gonna be your squeeze.
I'm not gonna be your partner.

23:21.566 --> 23:23.443
Look. Well, I don't have
a problem with that.

23:23.527 --> 23:24.903
I do!

23:24.986 --> 23:26.530
I like you very mu…

23:29.408 --> 23:30.742
I really do.

23:33.912 --> 23:35.539
But don't rush me into this.

23:37.082 --> 23:39.501
Just give me a little time to think.
That's all.

23:43.213 --> 23:45.841
(engine starts)

23:46.508 --> 23:47.467
(exhales)

23:48.385 --> 23:50.595
MAN: Got some handcuffs on sale, LaRue.

23:50.679 --> 23:53.056
But I imagine you get yours at wholesale.

23:53.140 --> 23:56.226
-Ah, take a walk, Peters.
-Oh. Hey, hey. Hey.

23:56.309 --> 23:58.520
Take a look--Take a look
at that new Danish annual.

23:58.603 --> 24:00.397
It's a regular barnyard inside.

24:00.480 --> 24:02.232
-(chuckles)
-(film projector whirring)

24:02.315 --> 24:03.733
-Hey.
-(woman moaning on film)

24:03.817 --> 24:05.777
-MAN (on TV): <i>Hello, Mimi.</i>
-(woman moaning)

24:07.487 --> 24:08.822
2,000 even.

24:10.157 --> 24:12.909
-Do you want to count it?
-No. That's cool.

24:12.993 --> 24:14.995
-I owe you one.
-That's comforting.

24:15.704 --> 24:18.248
Especially after those Midtown boys
busted me last month.

24:18.331 --> 24:22.210
Hey. You get this straight.
It's a loan, Tanner. Just a loan.

24:22.294 --> 24:23.587
What's the juice?

24:23.670 --> 24:26.840
500 on top. Friday at the latest.

24:26.923 --> 24:28.925
-No problem.
-I hope not.

24:29.759 --> 24:32.971
After that it's 10% a week,
compounded daily.

24:33.054 --> 24:34.431
Ten a week?

24:35.557 --> 24:37.392
-Right.
-Hey, LaRue.

24:39.394 --> 24:41.313
You used to be such a clean whistle.

24:43.398 --> 24:46.276
Since when'd you start doing business
with guys like me, huh?

24:46.359 --> 24:47.444
(laughs)

24:47.527 --> 24:49.821
No. It's nothing important, Sarge.

24:51.239 --> 24:54.159
If you happen to see LaRue,
ask him to give me a call right away.

24:54.242 --> 24:56.453
I mean, it's, uh-- it's kind of important.

24:56.536 --> 24:58.872
Uh, comprehension-wise,

24:58.955 --> 25:01.374
I'm a bit in the dark here, Belker.

25:01.458 --> 25:03.877
<i>It's kind of personal, Sarge--</i>
<i>between me and him.</i>

25:06.755 --> 25:08.381
<i>No. Can't tell you that either.</i>

25:10.342 --> 25:12.511
<i>'Cause I don't know</i>
<i>who set up the belly dancer.</i>

25:12.594 --> 25:15.931
That guy spends more time on the phone
than my teenage daughter.

25:16.014 --> 25:17.849
BELKER:
<i>Well, I don't know what to tell you.</i>

25:17.933 --> 25:20.101
He got a call
from his mother this mornin'.

25:20.185 --> 25:23.355
She busted his chops for over 10 minutes
about his mating habits.

25:23.438 --> 25:26.358
-(bell jingles)
-Cool it. We got another customer.

25:26.441 --> 25:28.985
<i>-Come on in, pal.</i>
<i>-Yeah. Hey. How you doin'?</i>

25:29.069 --> 25:31.363
<i>-Good. How are you?</i>
<i>-Oh. Fair to middlin'.</i>

25:31.446 --> 25:34.533
<i>-Good. You got somethin' to sell today?</i>
<i>-Yeah. I got somethin'</i>

25:34.616 --> 25:36.785
<i>-I want to get off right away.</i>
-Oh, <i>marone.</i>

25:36.868 --> 25:39.996
All right. Move it. I want all your cash,
and I want it right now.

25:41.331 --> 25:43.500
Come on. Come on. Move it.

25:43.583 --> 25:45.252
You sure you want to be doing this?

25:45.335 --> 25:48.630
I said move it, short stuff,
or I'll blow your head off right here.

25:51.341 --> 25:53.635
Come on. I ain't got all day.
Let's get it on!

25:54.678 --> 25:55.971
Come on. Come on.

25:57.138 --> 25:59.391
You know, before you do
anything real stupid,

25:59.474 --> 26:03.103
I think that you gotta take a look
at our specialty items first.

26:03.186 --> 26:04.646
Look. I ain't got all day.

26:05.647 --> 26:06.982
Can you see that?

26:08.400 --> 26:11.653
That's a 12-gauge double-barrel
with a money-back guarantee

26:11.736 --> 26:13.863
pointed right between your eyes.

26:16.825 --> 26:19.661
Comes as a matching set
with this one here.

26:20.120 --> 26:22.372
All right.
Tell you what I'm gonna do for you.

26:22.455 --> 26:24.291
If you take the both of 'em,

26:24.374 --> 26:27.711
I'm gonna throw in my police badge and…

26:27.794 --> 26:30.005
this gorgeous video unit here.

26:30.088 --> 26:32.173
You smile, dog breath!

26:32.882 --> 26:34.843
You're on <i>Candid Camera!</i>

26:38.013 --> 26:40.223
MAN: All right. You take the second watch.

26:40.307 --> 26:42.851
-WOMAN: Hill Street station.
-(phone ringing)

26:42.934 --> 26:45.103
Hey, Leo. (laughs)

26:45.186 --> 26:48.273
Hey. Thanks for the birthday surprise
in roll call this morning.

26:48.356 --> 26:50.609
-Ooh. The shimmy on that woman.
-Yeah.

26:50.692 --> 26:54.696
Ooh, ooh! Not to mention
the undulating abdominal region.

26:54.779 --> 26:58.366
Yeah. She was some cookie, but, uh--
Hey. I can't take credit.

26:58.450 --> 27:00.493
I was, uh, just as surprised
as you were, Sarge.

27:00.577 --> 27:01.953
Oh. Wasn't you, huh?

27:02.037 --> 27:04.331
-Uh-uh.
-How about Delgado?

27:04.414 --> 27:06.499
-He's got that kind of mind.
-(phone rings)

27:06.583 --> 27:09.002
Well, I doubt it, but you can ask.

27:10.170 --> 27:11.379
(phone rings)

27:11.463 --> 27:13.340
Move your feet, dog barf!

27:16.426 --> 27:18.511
Belker. Tag the cannon.

27:18.595 --> 27:19.679
(explosion)

27:19.763 --> 27:21.723
-(shouting)
-MAN: Hold it! Hold it!

27:24.309 --> 27:26.728
(clicks, whirs)

27:32.359 --> 27:33.860
(phone rings)

27:35.153 --> 27:38.698
(indistinct chatter)

27:41.076 --> 27:42.911
MAN: It's supposed to be safe in here.

27:42.994 --> 27:46.206
(chuckles)

27:47.499 --> 27:49.584
Inside, dog drool!

27:49.668 --> 27:51.336
-Come on!
-Hey. Come on, man.

27:51.419 --> 27:52.587
(growls)

27:53.755 --> 27:55.298
MAN: All right. Where were we?

27:56.466 --> 28:01.596
Leo, uh, maybe call the vending machine
company, would you, huh?

28:01.680 --> 28:04.140
-Leo.
-Oh, boy.

28:04.849 --> 28:06.476
(indistinct chatter)

28:08.895 --> 28:10.772
Oh, now, what is this?

28:10.855 --> 28:12.524
Hey, hey, hey. Get your feet off here.

28:12.607 --> 28:15.151
Don't ever have your feet like that
in a police station ever.

28:15.235 --> 28:17.028
-Get her out of here.
-HILL: I know where--

28:17.112 --> 28:19.030
I know you know where.
Just get her out of here.

28:19.114 --> 28:21.908
Know what? We had to take
those two children down to juvenile hall.

28:21.991 --> 28:23.451
We can't find a welfare worker.

28:23.535 --> 28:25.370
-She is the worst--
-Keep trying, Andy.

28:25.453 --> 28:29.708
-Renko. You by any chance seen LaRue?
-(exhales): LaRue?

28:29.791 --> 28:32.961
Yeah. Him and Washington are on some kind
of cocaine stakeout or something.

28:33.044 --> 28:34.921
-Why? What's the problem?
-It's no problem.

28:35.004 --> 28:37.257
If you talk to him, tell him to call me.
It's important.

28:37.340 --> 28:39.008
Mick, what happened to that machine?

28:39.926 --> 28:43.847
Mick, I-- I was gonna eat somethin'
when I came back here. I got all--

28:43.930 --> 28:47.559
(cheerful music playing)

28:47.642 --> 28:49.686
(indistinct chatter)

29:04.868 --> 29:06.786
MAN: Ah, I'm busy. Sorry.

29:12.792 --> 29:14.294
WOMAN: Hey. Look out, buddy.

29:14.377 --> 29:16.004
(indistinct chatter continues)

29:23.344 --> 29:24.971
He's in the food stand, J.D.

29:33.855 --> 29:35.690
(no audible dialogue)

29:39.319 --> 29:41.696
(woman speaking Spanish)

29:41.780 --> 29:43.990
-(indistinct chatter)
-Damn.

29:44.741 --> 29:45.909
(horn honks)

29:45.992 --> 29:48.828
MAN: Hey, man! Watch where you're goin'!

29:52.081 --> 29:54.584
Damn! I think he's trying to shake us.

29:54.667 --> 29:56.252
Cover the Grant Street entrance.

29:56.336 --> 29:58.213
(action music playing)

29:58.296 --> 29:59.589
Watch it.

30:05.220 --> 30:07.555
(panting)

30:09.808 --> 30:11.851
J.D. J.D.!

30:11.935 --> 30:14.062
Damn it, J.D. Where the hell are you?

30:14.145 --> 30:17.315
Good, man. I was afraid
you wouldn't get that two thou in time.

30:17.398 --> 30:20.527
Oh, hi, Ma. Yeah.
Everything's "copa" down here.

30:20.610 --> 30:22.821
-Got here just fine.
-All right. Look. That's good.

30:22.904 --> 30:24.823
-How we doin'?
-He's one game up.

30:24.906 --> 30:27.867
I'll let him win two more,
then I'll smack him.

30:27.951 --> 30:30.119
All right. Look.
You take this thing slow and easy.

30:30.203 --> 30:32.622
I want to make it look
as close as possible. Right?

30:32.705 --> 30:35.667
Aw, tough break. Just missed the 15 ball.

30:35.750 --> 30:38.419
Listen. Ma,
I'll be home for dinner. Okay? Bye.

30:40.880 --> 30:42.006
(exhales deeply)

30:43.925 --> 30:45.343
(laughs)

30:46.302 --> 30:48.805
Pa, I'm laughing because I don't believe
what I'm hearing.

30:49.889 --> 30:52.141
All right. But I want you to calm down
long enough

30:52.225 --> 30:55.395
to tell me why you want to put my mother
in a mental institution.

30:57.063 --> 30:59.649
What do you mean you're in love
with another woman? You're 83.

30:59.732 --> 31:02.026
Where you goin' so fast
with another woman?

31:03.820 --> 31:07.115
That's crazy. You can't keep up
with a 68-year-old.

31:07.198 --> 31:08.658
I mean, how often can you--

31:09.367 --> 31:11.035
No kidding. That often?

31:12.036 --> 31:13.538
What's Ma been feeding you?

31:15.957 --> 31:18.793
Your welfare worker, Miss Thompson,
is tied up in court all day.

31:18.877 --> 31:21.796
-She'll be seeing you tomorrow.
-What about my babies?

31:23.506 --> 31:25.592
They'll have to stay in juvenile hall.

31:26.759 --> 31:29.429
I talked with the captain about it.
He said not to file charges,

31:29.512 --> 31:32.932
providing you promise to come in here
tomorrow and meet with your welfare lady.

31:33.016 --> 31:36.644
-Please, don't take my babies from me.
-I can't do anything about that.

31:36.728 --> 31:38.563
-You can do it.
-I can't do it.

31:39.063 --> 31:40.773
I warned you, Shirret.

31:40.857 --> 31:42.609
The welfare lady warned you.

31:42.692 --> 31:45.278
We tried to work it out with you,
but you just couldn't cut it,

31:45.361 --> 31:47.405
-so that's all there is to it.
-You can do it,

31:47.488 --> 31:48.990
but you just hate me too much

31:49.073 --> 31:52.160
'cause deep down inside you're just
as chuck belly fish white as they are.

31:52.243 --> 31:55.663
I didn't put your babies in a home, girl!
You did that!

31:55.747 --> 31:58.625
-You're lyin'! You're lyin'!
-You did it, Shirret!

31:58.708 --> 32:01.336
You understand? You did that!

32:04.589 --> 32:08.760
Girl, you don't know
how ashamed you make me feel.

32:09.802 --> 32:12.639
-FURILLO: Neal.
-He shook me down on Lafayette Avenue.

32:12.722 --> 32:15.600
Boy, sure sounds as if he's getting ready
to move some merchandise.

32:15.683 --> 32:18.853
Yeah. I wouldn't mind staking out
that hairdresser's tonight.

32:18.937 --> 32:21.439
We take Weeks into the coroner's inquest
tomorrow.

32:21.522 --> 32:23.107
Let's do this right, maybe get lucky.

32:23.191 --> 32:25.026
I'll see what I can work out
with Narcotics.

32:25.109 --> 32:27.236
-Right.
-Where's LaRue?

32:27.320 --> 32:28.404
Couldn't say.

32:29.906 --> 32:31.115
He'll turn up.

32:32.492 --> 32:34.661
(phone rings)

32:34.744 --> 32:36.412
(indistinct chatter)

32:36.496 --> 32:38.539
-Yeah.
-Yeah. It's me. What's goin' on?

32:38.623 --> 32:41.292
-Yeah, Ma.
-Hey, look. How much?

32:41.376 --> 32:43.544
Ah--How much you think we're up?

32:43.628 --> 32:46.756
-By a thou?
-You're close.

32:46.839 --> 32:48.716
Six grand.

32:48.800 --> 32:51.427
Six grand? Six grand?

32:51.511 --> 32:52.470
(laughs)

32:52.553 --> 32:54.722
All right. Look. Stay there.
Just stay there.

32:54.806 --> 32:56.933
Hey, Ma. Would you stop worrying?

32:57.016 --> 32:58.393
I'll be right over. Right.

32:58.476 --> 32:59.978
(cheerful music playing)

33:00.061 --> 33:01.062
(laughing)

33:01.145 --> 33:02.939
(indistinct murmuring)

33:11.030 --> 33:13.282
(theme music playing)

33:13.366 --> 33:15.368
(tire scrapes curb)

33:25.336 --> 33:26.462
Kid?

33:31.384 --> 33:34.595
-(whispering): Hey, kid.
-(coughs)

33:35.304 --> 33:36.556
(groans)

33:43.062 --> 33:46.315
Oh, man. Oh, man.

33:50.111 --> 33:52.363
They get it all? Every nickel?

33:58.745 --> 34:02.373
Okay. Come on. Try to get up on your feet.
I'm gonna get you down

34:02.457 --> 34:03.624
the hospital to Emergency.

34:03.708 --> 34:05.334
I can't.

34:05.418 --> 34:07.754
Damn it to hell.
Get on your feet, will ya? Come on.

34:07.837 --> 34:10.590
(panting)

34:12.633 --> 34:13.760
Had to do it, huh?

34:15.470 --> 34:17.388
You had to make him look silly, didn't ya?

34:20.516 --> 34:22.060
Okay. Come on.

34:22.143 --> 34:24.687
Easy now. Easy.

34:26.064 --> 34:29.400
(grunts)
We've had it with you guys up here.

34:29.484 --> 34:32.070
I've never seen machines vandalized
or abused like this.

34:32.153 --> 34:34.155
-Hold it down. No yelling.
-No, no, no.

34:34.238 --> 34:36.532
Let me tell you something.
You're worse than the kids.

34:36.616 --> 34:37.992
No. This is it. This is it.

34:38.076 --> 34:41.370
I'm taking every one of my machines
out of--out of this lunatic asylum!

34:41.454 --> 34:43.706
What can I say? We try our best,
but given the traffic,

34:43.790 --> 34:45.083
we can't always be attentive

34:45.166 --> 34:47.293
to the health and welfare
of these fine machines.

34:47.376 --> 34:48.920
Guys are really gonna miss 'em.

34:49.003 --> 34:51.964
Especially those little sweet rolls
that come four to a package with--

34:52.048 --> 34:53.424
-Oh, yeah.
-What's that stuff--

34:53.508 --> 34:57.220
That's right. With the lemon cream
with the coconut and the nutmeg.

34:58.054 --> 35:01.390
-Come on now. It's on the truck.
-Lou. Lou. Come on.

35:01.891 --> 35:03.017
Hey, Lou. Lou. Look.

35:03.101 --> 35:06.104
Hey. Why don't I buy you guys
a couple of cups of java?

35:06.187 --> 35:09.190
If we're parting ways, there's no reason
not to do so amicably.

35:09.273 --> 35:13.236
After all, you've got your needs,
we've got our needs, et cetera, et cetera.

35:13.319 --> 35:14.278
(scoffs)

35:14.362 --> 35:15.363
You know something?

35:15.446 --> 35:16.781
This is the same line you pulled

35:16.864 --> 35:19.033
the last time I wanted to get
my machines out of here.

35:19.117 --> 35:20.660
Guilt! The guilt trip.

35:20.743 --> 35:21.994
No coffee. Nothing. No.

35:22.078 --> 35:26.457
You make it sound like I was
trying to manipulate you. No, Lou.

35:26.541 --> 35:28.084
Lou.

35:28.167 --> 35:30.795
Captain's setting up down
in the roll call. Through that door.

35:30.878 --> 35:31.879
Right.

35:33.131 --> 35:34.006
Washington.

35:35.007 --> 35:38.427
Hey, uh,
I hear you been shouldering most of this.

35:39.262 --> 35:40.388
What's your game?

35:41.264 --> 35:42.723
(chuckles)

35:45.643 --> 35:46.519
Right.

35:46.602 --> 35:50.898
FURILLO: The suspect's name is
George Allen Reiner. Alias Pinky.

35:50.982 --> 35:53.693
About 30 years old. About six feet tall.

35:54.652 --> 35:56.821
Reddish-brown hair. An expensive dresser.

35:57.655 --> 36:01.200
Detective Washington took this picture
outside the Bixby Hotel this morning.

36:02.326 --> 36:04.036
That and Narcotics' suspicion

36:04.120 --> 36:06.622
that he may be
a high-level cocaine importer

36:06.706 --> 36:08.082
are about all we have.

36:09.083 --> 36:11.627
-Jerry.
-Yeah. Couple of things.

36:12.295 --> 36:16.382
First, we all know the kind of pressure
the department's been putting on us

36:16.465 --> 36:19.552
to squelch the fun and games
until the Hill cools down.

36:20.136 --> 36:23.598
That means we go in fast, clean,
without incident.

36:23.681 --> 36:26.893
That means that nobody outside this room
knows what we're doin'.

36:27.852 --> 36:31.397
Look. I'm sorry, man. I had to get
this guy down to Emergency.

36:32.023 --> 36:33.816
The guy was worked over really bad.

36:33.900 --> 36:34.984
The next thing is

36:35.067 --> 36:37.737
we do have a search warrant here
from Judge Schoellkopf,

36:37.820 --> 36:39.739
but it's for the hairdresser's
exclusively.

36:39.822 --> 36:41.866
So, let's be careful
what doors we go through.

36:42.617 --> 36:43.784
Anything to add to this?

36:44.327 --> 36:45.328
Weeks?

36:46.204 --> 36:48.164
-No.
-Any questions?

36:49.665 --> 36:53.294
Neal. Come on, man. I said I was sorry.

36:54.587 --> 36:57.089
What the hell did you want me to do?
Let the guy just lay there?

36:57.173 --> 36:59.717
Hey. Tell me about it, man.
Look at you. You're half juiced.

36:59.800 --> 37:01.761
Hey, man. Hey, man. You come on now.

37:01.844 --> 37:04.096
I'm gonna tell you something.
I haven't had--

37:07.016 --> 37:09.560
I haven't had a drink all day.

37:09.644 --> 37:11.395
One drink. Okay. One drink all day.

37:11.479 --> 37:13.689
Yeah. One drink out of a bowl.

37:13.773 --> 37:17.235
Hey, look. That's the last time
you screw me up, J.D. The last time!

37:18.319 --> 37:20.780
Well, if it wasn't you,
Delgado, who was it?

37:20.863 --> 37:22.365
I mean, the thought is one thing,

37:22.448 --> 37:24.575
but I will not have
my roll calls disrupted.

37:24.659 --> 37:26.160
Not for any reason.

37:27.453 --> 37:30.539
Francis, they won't be pulling
out the vending machines after all.

37:30.623 --> 37:33.376
-I sat the guy down and talked to him.
-Good, Phil.

37:33.459 --> 37:35.586
You really must have
charmed his pants off.

37:35.670 --> 37:36.963
That's right, Lieutenant.

37:37.046 --> 37:40.174
I will not have my roll calls disrupted.
Not for any reason.

37:48.057 --> 37:49.892
(chuckling)

37:49.976 --> 37:51.852
So, what do you think
we ought to order here?

37:51.936 --> 37:55.147
The, uh, Chianti Ruffino here
or the Chianti Classico?

37:55.231 --> 37:57.566
The Classico's got
a little gold star next to it.

37:57.650 --> 37:59.902
(with French accent):
Oh, they sound wonderful.

37:59.986 --> 38:02.363
No, no. Don't talk French at me like that.

38:02.446 --> 38:05.074
(with regular accent):
But I think the Ruffino's cheaper.

38:05.157 --> 38:08.828
Cheap? I don't want to be cheap
when I'm out with my little princess.

38:08.911 --> 38:10.204
-Oh.
-Do you know

38:10.288 --> 38:12.248
that they have wine in this menu

38:12.331 --> 38:15.710
that costs $150 a bottle?

38:15.793 --> 38:16.919
-No.
-Yeah.

38:17.003 --> 38:17.837
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

38:17.920 --> 38:20.256
And I think maybe
we just oughta order some and taste it,

38:20.339 --> 38:23.092
or better yet, order some
and taste it and send it back.

38:23.175 --> 38:27.013
Or better yet, let me just, uh,
unload this little lump I have here.

38:27.096 --> 38:28.556
-What lump?
-This lump right here.

38:28.639 --> 38:30.349
-What is this?
-Just open it.

38:31.559 --> 38:33.602
Renko, what did you get me?

38:33.686 --> 38:36.314
I bought you a little box that has
some snakes in it that jump out

38:36.397 --> 38:39.692
and crawl up your nose. (laughing)

38:39.775 --> 38:41.319
-(chuckles): You're bad.
-Open it.

38:41.402 --> 38:42.945
Okay. (gasps)

38:43.029 --> 38:44.405
Oh…

38:44.488 --> 38:46.741
Oh, Andy, these are beautiful.

38:48.743 --> 38:52.079
-Oh, baby. I can't take these.
-Oh, yes, you can.

38:52.163 --> 38:54.206
You just take 'em right out of that box,

38:54.290 --> 38:57.626
and you put 'em right up next
to your pretty little ears, and you let--

38:58.461 --> 38:59.628
-Bobby.
-Hey, cowboy.

38:59.712 --> 39:01.255
About time you got here.

39:01.339 --> 39:05.468
Uh, Sandra Pauley, this is
Robert Eugene Hill, my partner.

39:05.551 --> 39:07.553
-Hi. Nice to meet you, Sandra.
-Nice to meet you.

39:07.636 --> 39:10.473
-And you're not late. We just got here.
-Sit on down here, Bobby.

39:10.556 --> 39:12.516
I see you're without a date as usual.

39:13.476 --> 39:16.520
Uh, well, she had to work late.
She'll try to meet us for dessert.

39:16.604 --> 39:18.230
-Yeah. I'm sure she will.
-Yeah.

39:18.314 --> 39:21.609
-Yeah.
-Well, now that I've finally met you,

39:21.692 --> 39:22.902
let me ask you a question.

39:22.985 --> 39:26.364
What does a beautiful woman
like you see in this guy?

39:26.447 --> 39:30.826
Other than maybe feeling sorry for him,
which we all naturally do. (laughs)

39:30.910 --> 39:33.537
It's the gift, Bobby.
Women can't say no to it.

39:33.621 --> 39:36.082
Oh, they can't, huh? (chuckles)

39:39.251 --> 39:40.836
Evening, Ms. Davenport.

39:40.920 --> 39:42.171
(laughs)

39:42.630 --> 39:43.714
Good evening.

39:52.515 --> 39:55.518
-For the club soda.
-MAN: Excuse me. Excuse me.

39:56.394 --> 39:58.187
We've been through this, Frank.

39:58.270 --> 40:00.773
We can't do that without compromising
each other's work.

40:00.856 --> 40:02.817
Joyce, please. I'm starving.

40:02.900 --> 40:04.527
Why can't we just go back, sit down

40:04.610 --> 40:07.071
and enjoy ourselves
like an ordinary couple?

40:07.154 --> 40:10.866
Frank, please. Let's eat at Santello's.

40:10.950 --> 40:14.203
We can fight tomorrow, huh?
Come on. It's been a long day.

40:14.286 --> 40:15.621
Give me a smile.

40:16.580 --> 40:17.706
Ugh.

40:18.833 --> 40:21.377
-The travel agent called.
-You're changing the subject.

40:21.460 --> 40:23.170
She can get us a suite right on the beach

40:23.254 --> 40:24.630
in the last two weeks of May.

40:24.713 --> 40:25.756
Okay. Terrific.

40:25.840 --> 40:28.050
As long as we can sit
at the same table when we eat.

40:28.134 --> 40:30.052
(chuckles)

40:30.594 --> 40:32.972
You can make it, can't you?
You'll make the time?

40:33.055 --> 40:35.307
Let somebody else put out the fires.

40:35.391 --> 40:38.269
How will we register? Mr. and Mrs.?

40:38.352 --> 40:40.104
Any way you want.

40:41.021 --> 40:42.398
Good. Let's try it.

40:42.481 --> 40:44.233
Maybe you'll get to like the sound of it.

40:46.110 --> 40:47.445
Who knows? Maybe so.

40:47.528 --> 40:51.740
(indistinct chatter)

40:54.118 --> 40:56.370
MAN (over walkie-talkie):
<i>He should've shown by now.</i>

40:56.454 --> 40:58.414
<i>We got the warrant, so let's go in.</i>

40:58.497 --> 41:01.083
Negative, man. We're here for Reiner.

41:01.167 --> 41:03.544
<i>Nail him, and we confirm Weeks's story.</i>

41:03.627 --> 41:06.255
We can nail anyone in there on possession.

41:07.465 --> 41:08.632
<i>You really amaze me.</i>

41:08.716 --> 41:11.427
Weeks is one of your own people,
and you just don't give a damn.

41:11.510 --> 41:14.513
Someone ought to read you
the facts of life, Jefferson.

41:14.597 --> 41:16.515
The name's Washington, Chuck.

41:16.599 --> 41:19.226
And you do this the way we agreed,
or scrap it right now.

41:19.310 --> 41:21.312
Hey. Come on. You want some coffee, babe?

41:21.395 --> 41:22.354
No.

41:23.397 --> 41:25.900
(tires squealing)

41:29.111 --> 41:30.362
That's him.

41:30.446 --> 41:31.739
<i>Gotta be.</i>

41:33.949 --> 41:35.534
He's careful, ain't he?

41:40.331 --> 41:43.292
Okay. Let's do it.
Grab the sucker with the briefcase.

41:43.375 --> 41:47.046
Patience, man. Patience. We got a warrant.

41:47.129 --> 41:50.799
Get off your butt and nail him.
Grab him before he goes in.

41:55.888 --> 41:59.892
They're playing games! I knew it!
There they go.

42:08.400 --> 42:10.611
-What the hell are they doing?
-Now.

42:13.405 --> 42:14.448
Go. Go. It's going down.

42:14.532 --> 42:16.992
MAN (over radio): <i>You got it, Washington.</i>
<i>Unit 6 coming in.</i>

42:17.076 --> 42:20.746
(sirens wailing)

42:21.622 --> 42:23.332
-Brakes, J.D.! Brakes!
-No brakes!

42:23.415 --> 42:25.000
WASHINGTON: Oh, no!

42:25.543 --> 42:29.755
-(bang)
-(glass shatters)

42:29.838 --> 42:32.216
(siren wailing)

42:37.638 --> 42:41.976
(indistinct chatter)

42:42.059 --> 42:44.687
I hear it's jewelry, not cocaine.

42:44.770 --> 42:47.147
We're tracing it with Burglary Division.

42:47.231 --> 42:49.900
It's hot anyway. That much we're sure of.

42:49.984 --> 42:51.944
This guy Weeks is something else.

42:52.027 --> 42:54.029
He sets up for cocaine and gets jewelry.

42:54.113 --> 42:56.949
I don't know what the hell to believe
anymore. Where's Washington?

42:57.032 --> 42:58.367
He's with the medics.

43:02.496 --> 43:03.956
Sorry about this, Captain.

43:07.376 --> 43:09.336
-Looks like a broken nose.
-Yep.

43:09.878 --> 43:11.422
You'd better get to a hospital.

43:11.505 --> 43:14.049
I thought I'd wait
until we finish mopping up.

43:14.133 --> 43:16.844
-Where's LaRue?
-He's down there.

43:17.845 --> 43:19.597
-Get to the hospital.
-Right.

43:21.223 --> 43:23.601
(exhales deeply)

43:24.435 --> 43:25.477
(sighs)

43:27.479 --> 43:28.856
Smart move, LaRue.

43:28.939 --> 43:32.568
You went out on an important operation
in a unit with no brakes.

43:32.651 --> 43:33.861
How do you explain that?

43:34.445 --> 43:35.904
Maybe I can explain it for you.

43:35.988 --> 43:38.115
Hey. Wa--Wa--

43:38.198 --> 43:40.159
You're a drunk, my friend.

43:40.242 --> 43:43.037
And because you're a drunk,
you're a screw-up.

43:43.120 --> 43:46.248
And I'm through waiting for you to change.
You got a couple of choices, pal.

43:46.332 --> 43:50.336
Either this, or you call
a Lieutenant Johnson down at Division,

43:50.419 --> 43:53.297
and you say to him,
"I'm a drunk, and I want to change."

43:53.380 --> 43:56.175
You got that? "I want to change."

43:56.258 --> 43:59.970
Otherwise, you're out
of this police department, and I mean now.

44:00.929 --> 44:02.556
Uh…

44:08.479 --> 44:11.273
(sobbing)

44:17.988 --> 44:20.866
Just because we turned up hot jewelry
instead of coke this time

44:20.949 --> 44:23.535
-doesn't mean he was wrong.
-There isn't gonna be a next time.

44:23.619 --> 44:25.537
Coroner's inquest is at 3:00
this afternoon.

44:25.621 --> 44:28.874
And with everybody breathing down their
necks, it looks as if Weeks is looking

44:28.957 --> 44:31.126
at a recommendation
of manslaughter to the D.A.

44:31.210 --> 44:34.129
-How does that grab ya?
-I still think I can turn it, Captain.

44:34.213 --> 44:36.924
Let me try talking to the victim's family
and having another shot

44:37.007 --> 44:38.676
at the store manager, Mr. Beau Gregory.

44:38.759 --> 44:41.220
Come on, Furillo.
3:00 this afternoon. What's to lose?

44:41.303 --> 44:43.555
I have a meeting
in three quarters of an hour

44:43.639 --> 44:46.600
with Chief Daniels
about last night's little fiasco

44:46.684 --> 44:48.894
that's likely to cost me a pound of flesh.

44:49.603 --> 44:50.979
That's what's to lose.

44:51.063 --> 44:53.524
You have any idea what captain's flesh
goes for these days?

44:55.401 --> 44:58.153
I don't know, Weeks. I begin to wonder

44:58.237 --> 45:01.490
if our desire to protect one of our own
hasn't muddied our thinking.

45:01.573 --> 45:03.617
-Meaning what?
-Meaning maybe

45:03.701 --> 45:06.537
there was only one unarmed kid
in that alley that night.

45:06.620 --> 45:08.914
Well, you think
whatever you like, Furillo.

45:08.997 --> 45:10.541
I know what I know.

45:10.624 --> 45:13.127
Captain.
Still haven't heard one single reason

45:13.210 --> 45:15.045
that justifies
why the kid was in the alley,

45:15.129 --> 45:16.964
alone or otherwise,
at 3:00 in the morning.

45:17.923 --> 45:18.799
Neither have I.

45:18.882 --> 45:20.551
Let's try the store manager again.

45:20.634 --> 45:24.096
-At this stage of the game--
-It'll look like exactly what it is:

45:24.179 --> 45:27.266
a last-minute attempt to finagle Weeks
out of an indictment.

45:31.437 --> 45:32.813
All right. Go ahead.

45:32.896 --> 45:36.608
What's to lose? We're in deep.
What the hell's another pound of flesh?

45:36.692 --> 45:38.485
-Go with him, would you, Henry?
-Sure.

45:38.569 --> 45:39.903
(phone rings)

45:42.406 --> 45:43.490
Hey. Washington.

45:46.034 --> 45:47.119
Why?

45:48.036 --> 45:50.748
I mean, wh-- what's in this for you?

45:50.831 --> 45:53.041
-What's the difference?
-No difference.

45:53.959 --> 45:58.046
It's just that, uh, if you had
your chance, no questions asked,

45:58.130 --> 46:00.382
I know you'd like to get a piece of me.

46:00.466 --> 46:02.760
-You got that right.
-Then why?

46:04.595 --> 46:07.556
Has to do with somethin'
you don't understand:

46:07.639 --> 46:09.099
being a good cop.

46:14.897 --> 46:16.899
(water running)

46:21.195 --> 46:23.405
Look, man. You gonna talk to me
about this or what?

46:23.489 --> 46:25.449
Nothing to talk about. It's finished.

46:25.532 --> 46:27.534
-Just like that, huh?
-Just like that?

46:28.452 --> 46:32.206
Man, J.D., don't make me have
to spell it out to ya.

46:32.289 --> 46:33.707
Just let it go.

46:34.458 --> 46:38.128
All right. I know you're upset, man.
You got every right in the world to be.

46:38.212 --> 46:41.590
-I've been a little out of line lately.
-A little out of line?

46:41.673 --> 46:44.259
Man, you almost killed me last night.

46:44.343 --> 46:47.179
You're a drunk. A user.

46:47.262 --> 46:49.348
And you have used me, J.D.

46:49.431 --> 46:51.266
You're a bottomless pit, man,

46:51.350 --> 46:54.019
and you drag everybody
who cares a damn about you into it.

46:54.102 --> 46:56.313
I can change, Neal. Honest to God, I can.

46:56.396 --> 46:59.024
I just gotta straighten my life out first.
That's all.

46:59.107 --> 47:01.735
You won't get your life straightened out
till you change.

47:02.569 --> 47:03.862
And you know what, lover?

47:04.947 --> 47:06.365
I don't think you can do it.

47:17.334 --> 47:18.919
(exhales)

47:25.926 --> 47:26.927
(sighs)

47:31.515 --> 47:33.517
(theme music plays)
