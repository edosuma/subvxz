- Laura, what's seven times nine?
- Sixty-three.

25:18.099 --> 25:19.896
Thanks.

25:20.569 --> 25:22.059
Laura, what's eight times nine?

25:22.237 --> 25:24.262
Seventy-two.

25:26.041 --> 25:27.702
- Laura, what's nine...
- Eighty-one.

25:31.112 --> 25:34.172
Hello, ladies. I thought we'd all do
our homework together.

25:34.349 --> 25:37.341
- Uh-oh. Dad's paying bills. I'm out of here.
- Me too.

25:43.024 --> 25:46.892
I wouldn't go in there, Grandma.
Dad's paying bills.

25:48.263 --> 25:50.731
I can take my medication at any time.

25:55.804 --> 25:58.432
It's time to put some food
in that little belly of yours.

25:58.807 --> 26:01.970
Thanks, Rachel,
but I just had a couple of doughnuts.

26:03.512 --> 26:05.309
I was talking to little Richie.

26:05.480 --> 26:07.744
Carl, could you hold the baby for me
for a second?

26:07.916 --> 26:11.079
- What...? Is he dry?
- Yeah.

26:11.419 --> 26:12.511
Hello.

26:12.687 --> 26:15.815
How about a big smile for your Uncle Carl?
Come on. Oh, there it is.

26:16.658 --> 26:18.421
Oh, he's crazy about me, Rachel.

26:18.593 --> 26:20.584
[CARL BABBLING]

26:21.263 --> 26:24.699
Oh, excuse me, but are you,
by any chance, paying bills?

26:24.866 --> 26:26.493
Yes. Why?

26:26.968 --> 26:30.165
Come on, Richie. We're out of here.

26:35.844 --> 26:38.404
Just the man I wanted to see.

26:38.847 --> 26:44.080
Dad, I got this really big problem
and you're the only one that can help me.

26:44.386 --> 26:45.785
I gotta have new high-tops.

26:46.288 --> 26:49.314
Edward, the ones that you are wearing
are practically new.

26:50.258 --> 26:51.555
I can't wear these anymore.

26:52.093 --> 26:55.859
See? Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.

26:58.500 --> 27:01.333
- So?
- So it's embarrassing.

27:01.503 --> 27:02.868
The guy's retired.

27:05.206 --> 27:08.198
I think I'd look great
in a pair of Michael Jordans.

27:08.376 --> 27:11.573
I think you'd look great
in a military academy.

27:13.214 --> 27:16.945
Dad, I'm serious.
I gotta have new high-tops.

27:17.118 --> 27:18.847
Besides, they're only 70 bucks.

27:19.521 --> 27:21.955
Edward, I would not pay $70
for a pair of shoes...

27:22.123 --> 27:24.591
...if Lola Falana was in them.

27:25.727 --> 27:28.287
You are not getting new high-tops.

27:29.664 --> 27:33.225
Thanks a lot. Freshmen year is shot.

27:35.270 --> 27:37.761
Hi, honey. How was your day?

27:37.939 --> 27:41.431
CARL: Harriette, our food bills
are getting higher every month.

27:41.776 --> 27:44.677
Do we have any kids
you haven't told me about?

27:46.081 --> 27:48.982
I guess this is not a good time to tell you
that the car needs a tune-up.

27:49.150 --> 27:50.208
[SIGHS]

27:50.385 --> 27:53.912
Well, I guess I'll dump in some more
of that tune-up-in-the-can stuff.

27:54.089 --> 27:55.215
I tried that.

27:55.390 --> 27:57.381
The car spit it back at me.

27:59.260 --> 28:01.023
Carl, we must have the money.

28:01.196 --> 28:03.494
The police department
just got a pay increase.

28:03.665 --> 28:06.361
- When does it kick in?
- It already kicked in.

28:06.534 --> 28:08.661
That's funny. I didn't feel a thing.

28:09.204 --> 28:11.934
Harriette, why don't you ask for a raise?

28:12.107 --> 28:14.075
If anyone deserves one, it's you.

28:14.242 --> 28:16.676
<i>You are the best elevator operator
at the Chronicle.</i>

28:17.078 --> 28:20.013
<i>Carl, I'm the only elevator operator
at the Chronicle.</i>

28:20.749 --> 28:23.309
What I mean to say
is everybody likes you down there...

28:23.485 --> 28:25.749
...and, well, honey,
we sure could use the money.

28:27.455 --> 28:29.218
Well, you got that right.

28:29.391 --> 28:32.360
I'll go see Mr. Seeger tomorrow
after work and ask for a raise.

28:32.527 --> 28:34.461
That's my girl.

28:35.096 --> 28:37.428
- You almost finished paying bills?
- I just started.

28:37.832 --> 28:39.390
I'm out of here.

28:46.541 --> 28:50.204
- Dad, is Mom home yet?
- No.

28:50.378 --> 28:52.471
And why?

28:52.814 --> 28:55.476
Well, because I figured
maybe she could take me to the mall.

28:55.850 --> 28:57.841
[CHUCKLING]

28:59.287 --> 29:02.984
Edward,
you are not getting those new high-tops.

29:03.458 --> 29:07.451
Dad, I'm just going to look at them.

29:08.229 --> 29:11.357
Son, there is an old saying:

29:11.533 --> 29:14.969
Once I was sad because I had no shoes...

29:15.136 --> 29:17.934
...until I met a man who had no feet.

29:19.641 --> 29:21.370
Did I meet him?

29:21.943 --> 29:24.036
You are not getting those new high-tops,
son.

29:28.717 --> 29:31.811
HARRIETTE: Hi, honey.
- Hi, baby. How'd it go at work today?

29:32.287 --> 29:35.916
Well, I walked into Mr. Seeger's office
and asked for a raise.

29:36.091 --> 29:37.888
And what happened?

29:38.760 --> 29:40.660
He gave me this.

29:44.733 --> 29:46.064
Wha...

29:47.268 --> 29:48.963
HARRIETTE: Hello, Mother Winslow.
- Hi, honey.

29:49.137 --> 29:51.230
- Hi, Mom.
- Harriette...

29:51.406 --> 29:54.375
...please tell me
that I'm looking at a bonus.

29:54.542 --> 29:57.375
No, Carl.
You're looking at severance pay.

29:57.545 --> 30:01.504
<i>As of tomorrow, the Chronicle will have
a new self-service elevator.</i>

30:01.683 --> 30:02.741
That's great, Mom.

30:03.017 --> 30:05.645
It'll make your job a lot easier.

30:06.387 --> 30:08.855
Edward, your mother was just fired.

30:10.258 --> 30:13.386
- From her job?
- No, from a cannon.

30:14.329 --> 30:16.160
Harriette, that's terrible.

30:16.331 --> 30:17.593
I thought they liked you.

30:17.766 --> 30:19.393
They do.

30:19.567 --> 30:22.001
That's why they didn't go self-service
years ago.

30:22.170 --> 30:23.933
They didn't have the heart to fire me.

30:24.105 --> 30:26.266
What changed their minds?

30:26.441 --> 30:31.242
Well, I could be wrong, but I think
it was when I took Carl's advice...

30:31.412 --> 30:34.381
...and marched in there like a fool
and asked for a raise.

30:36.351 --> 30:38.478
Way to go, Carl.

30:40.588 --> 30:42.579
[LAUGHING]

30:44.159 --> 30:45.319
What happened?

30:45.660 --> 30:48.891
- You people look like you're at a funeral.
- We are.

30:49.063 --> 30:51.793
Mom's job just dropped dead.

30:53.802 --> 30:56.498
- What?
- I was fired today, Rachel.

30:56.871 --> 30:59.101
Don't worry, Harriette.

31:00.108 --> 31:01.575
Everything is gonna be fine.

31:01.743 --> 31:04.268
If we need extra money,
I'll get some part-time work.

31:04.846 --> 31:07.576
But if we need some quick cash,
we can sell Judy's toys.

31:07.749 --> 31:08.773

31:15.423 --> 31:17.050
- Fold.
- Stuff.

- Fold.

- Stuff.
- Seal.

31:24.966 --> 31:28.663
So this is the kind of job
that's gonna save the family?

31:29.671 --> 31:33.107
Hey, don't break our rhythm.
We're a well-oiled machine. Fold.

31:33.274 --> 31:34.639
- Stuff.
- Seal.

31:34.909 --> 31:36.900
- Aunt Rachel?
- Yes, honey.

31:37.078 --> 31:39.069
What are these?

31:39.714 --> 31:43.343
That's the other half
of what we're supposed to be stuffing.

31:46.054 --> 31:47.954
Unseal.

31:48.556 --> 31:50.353
Unstuff.

31:50.992 --> 31:52.892
Unfold.

31:55.129 --> 31:59.998
Harriette, you are going to get a job today.
I can feel it.

32:00.168 --> 32:03.001
That's what you said all week,
but I still don't have a job.

32:03.371 --> 32:05.703
Well, today is your day, honey.
I just know it.

32:06.107 --> 32:08.598
Nobody's hiring elevator operators.

32:08.776 --> 32:11.210
Well, then forget about
being an elevator operator.

32:11.379 --> 32:14.576
Honey, there must be a thousand jobs
out there you'd be perfect for.

32:14.749 --> 32:16.774
All you have to do is find one of them.

32:17.085 --> 32:21.021
But, come on, where's that
Harriette Winslow, l-can-do-anything smile?

32:22.757 --> 32:24.349
There it is. Now, see?

32:24.692 --> 32:27.786
Who can resist that smile?

32:28.663 --> 32:31.723
Thanks, I feel better already,
and today is the day.

32:31.900 --> 32:34.494
When I walk back through that door,
I'm gonna have me a job.

32:34.669 --> 32:36.637
Go get them, tiger.

32:37.071 --> 32:41.030
Well, we finished the first batch
and we are really rolling now.

32:41.209 --> 32:42.267
Who's we?

32:42.443 --> 32:45.412
I made the girls assistant encasement
interlay specialists.

32:45.747 --> 32:49.410
- They're what?
- Envelope stuffers.

32:50.885 --> 32:53.786
It's fun except for the gross taste
it leaves in your mouth.

32:53.955 --> 32:56.355
- You're supposed to use a sponge.
- I did.

32:56.524 --> 32:59.084
But I still didn't get all that glue
off my tongue.

33:01.763 --> 33:05.995
Come on, girls. We have to get down
to correspondence-delivery headquarters.

33:06.167 --> 33:08.260
That means post office.

33:08.436 --> 33:10.233
Carl, would you listen for the baby?

33:10.405 --> 33:12.464
- All right. No problem.
- Okay.

33:13.908 --> 33:16.706
Dad, I've been thinking.

33:16.878 --> 33:20.075
No, Edward,
you're not getting those high-tops.

33:20.982 --> 33:22.882
How'd you know
that's what I was thinking?

33:23.051 --> 33:25.884
Because, son,
I know that you have a one-track mind...

33:26.054 --> 33:28.022
...and right now it is on shoes.

33:28.189 --> 33:30.885
If you want high-tops,
you're gonna have to use your money.

33:31.259 --> 33:35.093
Use my own money? For shoes?

33:40.001 --> 33:42.868
By the time I save enough
for those high-tops, I'll be dead.

33:43.404 --> 33:44.996
Well, now, don't worry about that.

33:45.173 --> 33:47.971
We'll bury you with feet sticking out
so people can see them.

33:52.947 --> 33:55.780
Harriette, back so soon?

33:55.950 --> 33:57.440
What's wrong?

33:57.618 --> 33:59.609
The car broke down
at the end of the block.

34:00.288 --> 34:04.918
- You left the car in the middle of the street?
- No, it left me in the middle of the street.

34:05.526 --> 34:08.620
Come on, son,
let's go push the car back home.

34:09.364 --> 34:11.491
Oh, don't worry, honey.

34:11.833 --> 34:13.300
Things aren't that bad.

34:13.601 --> 34:15.431
Did I mention that the car was on fire?

34:30.451 --> 34:32.543
- Hi, everybody.
- Hi, honey.

34:32.719 --> 34:34.380
Any luck finding a job today?

34:34.922 --> 34:37.652
Nothing. Not a nibble.
But tomorrow's another day.

34:37.824 --> 34:40.589
Well, now, listen.
You just sit down and relax.

34:40.762 --> 34:42.786

- Everybody to the table.

if you don't find a job soon...

34:55.877 --> 34:57.777
...you can always help us
stuff envelopes.

34:58.846 --> 35:00.143
Thanks.

35:00.314 --> 35:04.216
Carl, I'd like to say grace tonight.
Do you mind?

35:04.385 --> 35:06.376
Oh, go right ahead, Mama.

Dear Lord, we thank you
for this food we have before us.

35:13.127 --> 35:15.823
And we ask you to watch over us...

35:15.997 --> 35:19.455
...and to give Harriette
the strength she needs...

35:19.634 --> 35:22.398
...to go out every day looking for work.

35:24.539 --> 35:28.270
Please bless her
with patience and understanding...

35:28.443 --> 35:34.109

from job after job after job after job...

35:42.890 --> 35:45.085
Thanks for cooking tonight,

35:45.259 --> 35:46.658
Well, I'm only trying to help.

only cost $4.60.

[CARL CHUCKLES]

35:53.000 --> 35:56.936
If it's one thing my mother knows, it's how
to feed a large family on a small budget.

35:57.105 --> 35:59.005
Well, I lived through the Depression.

35:59.173 --> 36:00.435
What's a depression?

36:00.808 --> 36:03.800
Oh, it was a long time ago, honey.

36:03.978 --> 36:05.411
The banks had failed.

36:05.680 --> 36:11.175
People lost their jobs
and had to live on practically nothing.

36:11.919 --> 36:14.046
Pass this to your father.

36:16.724 --> 36:18.624
What is that?

36:18.993 --> 36:21.086
That's mashed turnips and bacon.

36:21.262 --> 36:23.696
I don't see no bacon.

36:24.132 --> 36:26.123
I only used the drippings.

36:26.300 --> 36:28.393
I can get another meal out of that meat.

36:28.769 --> 36:30.999
That's why they call it
the Depression Dinner.

36:32.340 --> 36:34.399
Well, I'm depressed.

36:36.110 --> 36:39.637
Carl, there could be rough times ahead.

36:40.114 --> 36:42.810
Mother, this is only temporary.

36:42.984 --> 36:47.683
That's what they said about the Depression,
and it lasted 10 years.

36:47.855 --> 36:50.722
Ten long years.

36:51.025 --> 36:53.425
And then the war started.

36:56.164 --> 36:58.826
I'm sorry, Mother Winslow.
I'm not hungry anymore.

36:59.000 --> 37:02.333
- Me neither.
- Uh, sit down and eat your turnips.

37:02.503 --> 37:07.270
I just don't know why everybody
is complaining. I always loved turnips.

37:10.912 --> 37:13.437
Maybe it was parsnips.

37:16.417 --> 37:18.044
Excuse me.

37:24.825 --> 37:26.952
Do you mind if I join you?

37:28.930 --> 37:31.660
Go ahead.
But I'm not gonna be good company.

37:32.366 --> 37:34.994
Well, now, I don't know about that.

37:43.344 --> 37:46.802
Honey,
I know how frustrating it is for you...

37:46.981 --> 37:51.418
...going out there every day for a job
and coming back empty-handed.

37:51.586 --> 37:54.521
But you just can't give up hope,
you know?

37:55.189 --> 37:56.486
Carl, your mother's right.

37:56.958 --> 37:59.825
It's gonna get a lot worse
before it gets better.

38:00.795 --> 38:03.992
Let's face it.
All I've ever done is run an elevator.

38:04.165 --> 38:07.498
Oh, now, Harriette,
you know that's not true.

38:07.668 --> 38:09.898
You worked for the police department.

38:10.471 --> 38:12.166
But that was years ago.

38:12.340 --> 38:16.174
And then it was only for a few months
before I got pregnant with Eddie.

38:16.744 --> 38:18.473
Boy, do I remember that.

38:18.646 --> 38:21.740
That was some wicked morning sickness.

38:23.284 --> 38:26.720
Yeah, but after the doctor
prescribed those pills, you were fine.

38:31.192 --> 38:35.788
Well, we got through that together
and we can get through this together.

38:37.064 --> 38:39.123
I don't know, Carl.

38:39.300 --> 38:42.565
You know,
I thought I'd be able to find a job...

38:42.737 --> 38:44.967
...making as much as I did
on the old one.

38:45.139 --> 38:47.437
I see I'm gonna have to take
whatever I can get.

38:47.608 --> 38:49.235
No. Now, no.

38:49.410 --> 38:50.934
Now, I don't want you doing that.

38:51.279 --> 38:54.271
Carl, we need the money,
and I'm not gonna let this family down.

38:54.682 --> 38:57.378
Have you heard about any jobs
that you might find exciting?

38:58.185 --> 39:01.052
Well, there was one,
but they're not gonna give it to me.

39:01.222 --> 39:02.985
Well, what was it?

39:03.424 --> 39:07.053
Well, the other day
when Mr. Seeger was firing me...

39:07.228 --> 39:09.992
<i>...I noticed a posting for a security job
at the Chronicle.</i>

39:10.164 --> 39:13.565
Now, there you go.
Honey, you can do that.

39:13.734 --> 39:16.168
Harriette,
you graduated from the police academy.

39:16.337 --> 39:18.032
<i>You know the Chronicle building.</i>

39:18.205 --> 39:19.502
You'd be perfect.

39:20.408 --> 39:23.605
The job requires management experience.
They're gonna tell me no.

39:23.911 --> 39:25.708
Honey, it's not what they tell you.

39:25.880 --> 39:27.871
It's what you tell them.

39:28.049 --> 39:32.418
All you have to do
is show them who you really are...

39:32.586 --> 39:36.249
...and you know
they're gonna want you real bad.

39:37.291 --> 39:38.451
You think so?

39:39.260 --> 39:43.492
I did. You're the best thing
ever happened to me.

39:46.167 --> 39:47.930
Carl, you should've gone into sales.

40:12.827 --> 40:14.226
Hello, Mr. Seeger.

40:14.395 --> 40:18.559
<i>Harriette. What a surprise.
It's nice to see you back at the Chronicle.</i>

40:18.733 --> 40:21.634
- I like the new self-service elevator.
- It's a beaut, isn't it?

40:22.002 --> 40:26.939
We should've put one in years ago.
Oh, I didn't mean that the way it sounded.

40:27.375 --> 40:29.866
Well, then I didn't hear it
the way it sounded.

40:30.044 --> 40:31.909
I'd love to sit and chat...

40:32.079 --> 40:35.242
...but I'm interviewing people
for assistant director of Security.

40:35.516 --> 40:36.983
I know. I'm your next interview.

40:37.451 --> 40:39.783
Harriette, that's a management position.

40:39.954 --> 40:42.980
Oh, I read the description
and I think I can handle the job.

40:43.391 --> 40:46.121
Okay, do you have a résumé?

40:46.293 --> 40:47.658
Oh, yeah.

40:48.829 --> 40:49.955
I typed it myself.

40:50.131 --> 40:52.122
That's nice.

40:52.466 --> 40:53.490
Let me see.

40:54.101 --> 40:56.763
<i>Two jobs. The one here at the Chronicle.</i>

40:57.571 --> 41:00.165
- I see you worked at the police department.
- Yes.

41:00.341 --> 41:02.036
Oh, but it was a clerical job.

41:02.209 --> 41:04.473
But I did graduate the police academy.

41:05.446 --> 41:07.937
Harriette, I like you, you know that.

41:08.115 --> 41:09.707
But this job isn't right for you.

41:09.884 --> 41:13.251
When something comes along that is right,
I'll give you a call.

41:13.421 --> 41:15.889
I know how tough it is out there.

41:17.658 --> 41:21.025
Would you mind asking Miss Olson
to send the next applicant in?

41:25.633 --> 41:29.899
Mr. Seeger,
I really believe I can do that security job.

41:30.070 --> 41:31.662
Harriette, I'm trying to be nice.

41:31.839 --> 41:34.637
But the fact is this job requires
management experience.

41:34.809 --> 41:36.470
You'd have people working under you.

41:36.644 --> 41:39.875
You'd have to be a leader,
an organizer, a mediator.

41:40.047 --> 41:43.073
Quite frankly,
this job is way out of your league.

41:43.250 --> 41:44.740
Oh, really, Mr. Seeger?

41:45.219 --> 41:48.586
For your information, I have management
experience coming out of my ears.

41:48.756 --> 41:51.816
- That's not on your résumé.
- Yes, it is.

41:51.992 --> 41:53.289
Right there, see?

41:53.727 --> 41:56.491
It says, Mrs. Harriette Winslow.

41:56.664 --> 42:00.100
I worked here full-time,
and I was a full-time mother.

42:00.267 --> 42:01.700
You wanna talk management?

42:01.869 --> 42:05.930
I managed a home,
a household budget and a family.

42:06.540 --> 42:10.874
And, Mr. Seeger, I'm talking about a job
you can't call in sick for...

42:11.045 --> 42:13.343
...you never get a raise or overtime.

42:13.714 --> 42:15.511
And you can't take vacation.

42:15.683 --> 42:20.279
Every day I'm a leader,
an organizer, and a mediator.

42:20.454 --> 42:22.251
Those are my qualifications.

42:22.423 --> 42:26.484
You want references?
Call Eddie, Laura and Judy Winslow...

42:26.660 --> 42:30.494
...and ask them about my work.
You know the number.

42:45.546 --> 42:47.673
I'm home.

42:49.183 --> 42:53.051
Harriette, you've been gone five hours.
What happened?

42:53.220 --> 42:55.620
Well, I went to see Mr. Seeger.

42:55.789 --> 42:59.748
I stared him straight in the eye,
and I told him I could do the job...

42:59.927 --> 43:01.258
...that I deserved the job...

43:01.428 --> 43:03.692
...and that he'd be a fool
not to give me the job.

43:03.864 --> 43:05.297
And then he gave you the job.

43:05.599 --> 43:08.830
No, he told me I was unqualified,
so I told him off.

43:09.537 --> 43:12.472
- And that took five hours?
- No, it only took about a minute.

43:12.640 --> 43:15.666
But it felt so good
I treated myself to a double feature.

43:15.843 --> 43:17.572
Well, good for you, honey.

43:18.078 --> 43:20.410
- Oh, hi, Mom.
- Hi, baby.

43:20.581 --> 43:22.412
Dad, guess what.

43:22.783 --> 43:26.241
Your son has saved $70
from working overtime at the market.

43:26.754 --> 43:28.483
Well, I'm proud of you, son.

43:28.656 --> 43:32.854
So I guess the next time we see you,
you'll be wearing a new pair of high-tops.

43:33.027 --> 43:34.892
Not really, Dad.

43:35.062 --> 43:37.758
I finally figured out the thing
about the guy with no feet.

43:39.066 --> 43:42.035
Here. I thought you could use this
to pay some bills.

43:42.202 --> 43:47.333
Harriette, we should feed this boy turnips
five times a day.

43:49.543 --> 43:51.408
Thank you, son.

43:55.082 --> 44:00.679
Oh, Harriette. Honey, congratulations.
I am so happy for you.

44:01.221 --> 44:03.348
You didn't get your first paycheck
for a while.

44:03.524 --> 44:06.891
So I took my envelope money,
and bought this family a celebration dinner.

44:07.061 --> 44:10.588
I got steak, I got potatoes, I got salad,
I got the works. Are you excited?

I know you must be.
Honey, you must feel fantastic.

44:13.534 --> 44:17.231
I know I do.
In fact, I'm so happy, I could slap myself.

Well, I did my best.
It just didn't work out.

like that?

44:54.775 --> 44:57.642

he said about you today.

44:57.811 --> 44:59.642
Wait, wait, wait a minute. Hold on.

44:59.813 --> 45:01.576

45:01.749 --> 45:03.410
Yeah, he phoned about an hour ago.

45:03.584 --> 45:06.018
H... Hold it now. What did he say?

45:06.654 --> 45:09.817
He mentioned that he was very impressed
by some speech you made.
