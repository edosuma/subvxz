WEBVTT

00:02.306 --> 00:05.048
FRANK:
You lock us in a room

00:05.092 --> 00:07.181
and then we try to escape.
That's it?

00:07.224 --> 00:09.748
Yes, that's correct. People
all over the world do this.

00:09.792 --> 00:12.186
We're one of 15 escape room
companies in Philly alone.

00:12.229 --> 00:14.275
Yes, I'm fully aware
of this practice.

00:14.318 --> 00:16.538
It's a highly sexual experience
for people.

00:16.581 --> 00:19.106
You'll get no judgments from us.

00:19.149 --> 00:22.196
No. No, no, no.
I'm sorry, this is not sexual.

00:22.239 --> 00:24.111
It's not sexual.
Then I don't know what this is.

00:24.154 --> 00:25.199
You've not explained it.

00:25.242 --> 00:27.201
Uh, well, it's a mystery
role-playing game.

00:27.244 --> 00:29.290
You solve puzzles in order
to escape from a room.

00:29.333 --> 00:31.683
It's really about seeing
how well you work as a team,

00:31.727 --> 00:33.207
and it's also a lot of fun.

00:33.250 --> 00:34.425
-FRANK: Hmm.
-This sounds very nerdy.

00:34.469 --> 00:36.079
-Is this a nerd thing?
-It's definitely a nerd thing.

00:36.123 --> 00:37.776
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-I don't do nerd things.
-DEE: No, no, no, no.

00:37.820 --> 00:39.082
It's not-it's not nerdy.
It's not nerdy.

00:39.126 --> 00:40.127
It's actually really fun.

00:40.170 --> 00:41.867
That's why I set
this whole thing up. You know?

00:41.911 --> 00:43.086
It's fun. I've done one before.

00:43.130 --> 00:45.088
-You've done one?
-With who?

00:45.132 --> 00:47.134
-My friends.
-What?!

00:47.177 --> 00:48.787
-What friends?
-We're your friends.

00:48.831 --> 00:49.919
All right, I did it alone.

00:49.962 --> 00:51.225
-She did it alone!
-Oh!

00:51.268 --> 00:52.704
Hey, it doesn't matter.
It's fun.

00:52.748 --> 00:54.532
So wait, wait a minute,
so what's the prize?

00:54.576 --> 00:56.665
If we get out of the room,
what do we get?

00:56.708 --> 00:58.667
Well, if you escape
before your time is up,

00:58.710 --> 01:01.104
we will put your team photo
on our website.

01:01.148 --> 01:02.758
-Just the picture?
-That's it?
-Just the picture.

01:02.801 --> 01:04.107
-That's the worst thing
I've ever heard.
-And it's not sexual?

01:04.151 --> 01:05.456
-I'm out. I'm out.
-DEE: Come on. Why does

01:05.500 --> 01:07.154
there have to be a prize?
Why does it have to be sexual?

01:07.197 --> 01:09.330
Why can't men just do something
for the challenge of it,

01:09.373 --> 01:10.244
'cause it's fun?

01:10.287 --> 01:12.376
Men don't do things
just to do them.

01:12.420 --> 01:14.378
Okay? We're busy
running the world,

01:14.422 --> 01:15.945
-providing for our families.
All right?
-Exactly.

01:15.988 --> 01:19.122
We need stakes. If there's
no stakes, what's the point?

01:19.166 --> 01:20.341
That's a good idea, though.

01:20.384 --> 01:23.387
How about if whoever wins,

01:23.431 --> 01:25.911
you buy them
a 20-ounce sirloin steak?

01:25.955 --> 01:27.261
-CHARLIE: Yeah.
-DENNIS: That makes sense.

01:27.304 --> 01:29.698
-That could be fun.
-As a man, that makes sense.

01:29.741 --> 01:31.308
-Well, okay, yes.
-FRANK: Different.

01:31.352 --> 01:33.136
DENNIS: Absolutely.
Then it becomes a game.

01:33.180 --> 01:34.616
You see, I get out of the room.

01:34.659 --> 01:36.357
That means I win the game,

01:36.400 --> 01:37.923
the lady here,
she takes me out for a steak,

01:37.967 --> 01:40.143
-and then it becomes sexual.
-WOMAN: Nope. No.

01:40.187 --> 01:42.276
That's not how it works.
So you have to win as a team...

01:42.319 --> 01:44.147
You know what?
Don't explain it anymore.

01:44.191 --> 01:45.279
Challenge accepted.

01:45.322 --> 01:48.238
â™ª

02:09.346 --> 02:11.174
Ooh, hoo, hoo,
this is gonna be so good.

02:11.218 --> 02:12.436
Whoa, they really went all-out.

02:12.480 --> 02:14.395
This might actually
be kind of fun.

02:14.438 --> 02:15.831
-Aah! Whoa, ho, ho!
-Oh, Dee!

02:15.874 --> 02:18.268
-Whoa, what...
-Guys, guys, guys,
I found something.

02:18.312 --> 02:19.400
What are you screaming at,
Deandra?

02:19.443 --> 02:20.314
You didn't even find it.

02:20.357 --> 02:21.750
-It was right there
on the table.
-[click]

02:21.793 --> 02:23.447
WOMAN [English accent]:
Greetings and salutations,

02:23.491 --> 02:25.536
-Detectives.
-Who's that broad?

02:25.580 --> 02:27.756
It's Amanda from before. She's
just doing a bad British accent.

02:27.799 --> 02:29.975
[English accent]:
A tuppence to you, Amanda.

02:30.019 --> 02:31.325
-[groaning]
-Oh, now she's gonna do it.
-Doth thou...

02:31.368 --> 02:33.240
Give me this,
'cause you can't...

02:33.283 --> 02:35.546
All right. Yeah, Amanda,
um, if you do that accent,

02:35.590 --> 02:38.854
-then Dee's gonna want to do it,
and we hate that.
-Yeah. Yeah.

02:38.897 --> 02:40.290
So w-why don't you just go?
You go.

02:40.334 --> 02:41.204
AMANDA [English accent]:
You have arrived

02:41.248 --> 02:43.467
at 221B Baker Street,

02:43.511 --> 02:46.209
home of world-famous...
um, excuse me.

02:46.253 --> 02:48.255
You're not supposed
to start searching yet.

02:48.298 --> 02:50.648
-I haven't started the timer.
-I didn't.

02:50.692 --> 02:51.997
AMANDA [normal voice]:
Oh, yes, you did.

02:52.041 --> 02:53.477
I have cameras
all over the room.

02:53.521 --> 02:54.696
I can see and hear
everything you do.

02:54.739 --> 02:56.785
Oh, my bad.
Okay, I stopped.

02:56.828 --> 02:59.004
AMANDA: No, you didn't.
Again, I can see you.

02:59.048 --> 03:01.050
Yeah, um, Amanda,
she's not gonna stop,

03:01.093 --> 03:04.009
so why don't you just, um,
uh, speed things along?

03:04.053 --> 03:06.273
AMANDA [English accent]: Oh, u-uh, Holmes is in trouble,

03:06.316 --> 03:07.578
-and he needs your help...
-Yeah, faster, faster.

03:07.622 --> 03:09.232
Oh, okay, well,
if you need a hint...

03:09.276 --> 03:11.234
Yeah, you know what? Um,
we're not... we don't like this

03:11.278 --> 03:13.236
at all. Um, why don't you just
go ahead and start the game?

03:13.280 --> 03:15.369
-AMANDA [normal voice]: Okay,
fine, your time starts now.
-[beep]

03:15.412 --> 03:17.371
-Oh! We're locked in.
Here we go!
-Oh, that's cool.

03:17.414 --> 03:18.894
-Whoa, whoa, whoa,
she locked the door?
-DENNIS: Yeah.

03:18.937 --> 03:20.722
Did you not listen to the whole
setup that the game nerd did?

03:20.765 --> 03:22.158
-That's what the game...
-No, that's-that's no good.

03:22.202 --> 03:24.378
I can't have that.
I can't be locked in.

03:24.421 --> 03:26.945
-W-What's the code for the door?
-DEE:
That's the whole point, Frank.

03:26.989 --> 03:29.078
-We're supposed
to work together...
-Shut up, Deandra.

03:29.121 --> 03:30.688
-I can't be locked in here.
-CHARLIE: O-Okay, calm down.

03:30.732 --> 03:32.081
You know, I was worried
that this might happen.

03:32.124 --> 03:34.344
Frank hasn't been locked up
since the nitwit school,

03:34.388 --> 03:35.693
so he gets a little tight
about it.

03:35.737 --> 03:37.304
I brought some of that gum
you like, buddy.

03:37.347 --> 03:38.609
You want to chew on that?
Want to chew on that?

03:38.653 --> 03:40.307
It's gonna settle you down.

03:40.350 --> 03:42.091
-That's gonna calm his nerves.
-DENNIS: All right, hey, guys.

03:42.134 --> 03:43.440
Uh, let's huddle up.
Guys, listen, listen.

03:43.484 --> 03:44.920
Frank, it's gonna be cool, man,
we can do...

03:44.963 --> 03:46.269
we can totally do this. Okay.

03:46.313 --> 03:47.923
Here's what I'm thinking:
I think-I think we should

03:47.966 --> 03:49.707
actually split up into teams,
and then when we find something,

03:49.751 --> 03:52.057
-we come...
we come back together,
-[smacking]

03:52.101 --> 03:55.496
and we put... we use the...
collective brain power...

03:55.539 --> 03:58.499
I'm sorry. Frank,
that gum-chewing is insane.

03:58.542 --> 04:00.196
-What?
-The chewing of the gum.
It's happening,

04:00.240 --> 04:01.676
u-uh, right in my ear.
It's ludicrous.

04:01.719 --> 04:04.069
That-that is the most irritating
sound on Earth.

04:04.113 --> 04:06.115
Ooh, ooh, ooh! Guys, guys.

04:06.158 --> 04:07.856
I'm thinking that
since I've done this before,

04:07.899 --> 04:09.858
-I should probably quarterback
this whole thing.
-Well, I spoke too soon.

04:09.901 --> 04:11.425
That's the most
irritating sound on Earth.

04:11.468 --> 04:13.340
-Yeah, yeah.
-DEE: And just, I can-I can
walk you guys through

04:13.383 --> 04:15.080
how to get clues, what you're
looking for, specifically.

04:15.124 --> 04:16.473
-Why don't you just
go find the clues?
-Thanks, Dee.

04:16.517 --> 04:18.214
-Help us out. Thanks, Dee.
-Go, go, go.

04:18.258 --> 04:19.520
-Yeah. Thanks a lot, Dee.
-Great, thanks.
-Keep going.

04:19.563 --> 04:21.522
-[gasps]
-Is she gonna be doing that
the whole time, man?

04:21.565 --> 04:24.525
-Like, just chiming in--
like, advice, and...
-DENNIS: You know she is.

04:24.568 --> 04:25.917
Did-did you hear what she said
about being the quarterback?

04:25.961 --> 04:27.571
Does she think she's the leader?

04:27.615 --> 04:29.356
Everybody knows
quarterbacks are men.

04:29.399 --> 04:31.488
And honestly, like,
I don't want to say it out loud,

04:31.532 --> 04:34.230
-but a female leader?
It's just...
-No.

04:34.274 --> 04:36.537
Doesn't sit well, right?
Doesn't sit well with me.

04:36.580 --> 04:37.929
-Gives me chills.
-It feels, like,
un-American, maybe?

04:37.973 --> 04:39.888
-Yeah. Bro.
-FRANK: It's un-American.

04:39.931 --> 04:41.019
-Very un-American.
-Is it? Is it?

04:41.063 --> 04:42.456
Thing is, is like,
we had a vote in America.

04:42.499 --> 04:43.587
-Yeah.
-We almost had one,

04:43.631 --> 04:45.372
and then America
was like, "Mm..."

04:45.415 --> 04:47.461
-No women.
-We couldn't have been
more clear about it.

04:47.504 --> 04:50.899
-Very clear.
-[quietly]: I... I got a plan.

04:50.942 --> 04:52.901
No, no, no, come on, you guys.

04:52.944 --> 04:54.381
No, we're supposed
to do this together.

04:54.424 --> 04:56.470
We're supposed to do it...
Goddamn it!

04:56.513 --> 04:58.123
FRANK:
Ah...

04:58.167 --> 04:59.560
so-so much more relaxed
without her in here.

04:59.603 --> 05:00.909
MAC:
That's the move.

05:00.952 --> 05:03.607
Both of 'em. I mean, the last
thing we need is two women,

05:03.651 --> 05:05.043
-"helping us"?
-Oh, I know.

05:05.087 --> 05:07.132
Why do you have a lock
on the outside of your door?

05:07.176 --> 05:09.047
Uh, well, that's... Don't ask.
You... Look, the point is,

05:09.091 --> 05:10.571
th-there's a lock on the door,

05:10.614 --> 05:11.920
and there's no way
Dee's getting out of there.

05:11.963 --> 05:13.574
-[laughs]
-All right,

05:13.617 --> 05:15.489
so now that we don't have those
ladies squawking in our ears,

05:15.532 --> 05:17.273
let's get back to doing
what men do best,

05:17.317 --> 05:18.796
and we strategize, okay?

05:18.840 --> 05:20.537
So we need to come up
with a game plan.

05:20.581 --> 05:22.583
-Yeah? All right.
-CHARLIE: Mm.

05:22.626 --> 05:24.933
-Yes. I know exactly
what we should do.
-I actually have a good idea.

05:24.976 --> 05:26.413
-Wait. Hold on, hold on, hold
on. Wait, don't interrupt me.
-Here's what we do...

05:26.456 --> 05:28.806
-No, no. We go... No, no!
-Mac, shut up.

05:28.850 --> 05:31.156
-Let me say my idea first.
-No, it's really good, it's
gonna get us out of the room.

05:31.200 --> 05:32.375
-I have a great idea.
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

05:32.419 --> 05:33.724
Slow down, slow down. Okay.

05:33.768 --> 05:35.509
Clearly, we're gonna
have to designate a leader here.

05:35.552 --> 05:37.598
-Oh.
-Oh! Right.
-Right?

05:37.641 --> 05:38.773
-Of course.
-That's what men do.

05:38.816 --> 05:40.078
What are we...
That's what men... Right!

05:40.122 --> 05:42.211
We-we figure out
who's, uh, in charge.

05:42.254 --> 05:43.517
-Right, exactly.
-That's how things work.

05:43.560 --> 05:44.431
I nominate Dennis.

05:44.474 --> 05:46.433
-Oh.
-Yes, because he's the smartest.

05:46.476 --> 05:47.825
-Right, Dennis?
-Uh, I-I am very smart,

05:47.869 --> 05:49.740
and it's not a bad idea
to have me be the leader.

05:49.784 --> 05:51.612
Plus, also now
that you've said it,

05:51.655 --> 05:52.961
I feel like it can't be unsaid.

05:53.004 --> 05:54.615
I wouldn't have said it,
but it is true.

05:54.658 --> 05:57.313
Uh... technically,
Frank is the oldest,

05:57.357 --> 05:58.749
which makes him the smartest.

05:58.793 --> 06:01.404
Yeah, but Dennis is, like, the
smartest person I've ever met,

06:01.448 --> 06:02.753
and I've met,
like, a hundred people.

06:02.797 --> 06:04.581
Ooh, you know,
that is a lot of people.

06:04.625 --> 06:05.843
Well, I've met, like 105.

06:05.887 --> 06:07.976
-Now, why would you...
-You have not. Where?

06:08.019 --> 06:10.195
-Whatever. Supermarket, mall.
-Charlie knows a lot of people.

06:10.239 --> 06:12.459
-I know people.
-I'll table it, I'll table it.

06:12.502 --> 06:14.417
Why don't we break up
into the two teams?

06:14.461 --> 06:16.114
I'll pick my leader,

06:16.158 --> 06:17.768
you pick yours,
and we can find our own clues.

06:17.812 --> 06:20.118
Uh, you know what? That's
actually a really great idea,

06:20.162 --> 06:22.207
because that creates
a more competitive atmosphere,

06:22.251 --> 06:23.644
-Okay.
-which is more conducive

06:23.687 --> 06:26.081
to the problem-solving abilities
of a man. Huh?

06:26.124 --> 06:27.778
-Huh?
-Yeah. Yeah, I think he's right.

06:27.822 --> 06:28.997
-All right, fine. You and me?
Want to split off?
-Okay.

06:29.040 --> 06:30.477
-You and me. Let's go.
-Lose these bozos.

06:30.520 --> 06:32.479
-[scoffs] We need 'em? No.
-All right, we're out of here.

06:32.522 --> 06:34.045
-Come on, follow me.
I got a couple ideas, man.
-He might-he might die.

06:34.089 --> 06:35.699
-He might die. Yeah.
-Good luck, suckers.

06:35.743 --> 06:39.137
All right. Hey, let's, uh,
let's find some clues, buddy.

06:39.181 --> 06:41.139
Don't worry, Dennis,
I already found one,

06:41.183 --> 06:43.577
and I think it's significant.

06:43.620 --> 06:45.579
-Whoa.
-It's a heart-shaped lock.

06:45.622 --> 06:47.581
-Whoa, excellent find, buddy.
-Yeah.

06:47.624 --> 06:49.147
[quietly]: Excellent.
Okay, the game is afoot.

06:49.191 --> 06:50.366
-[chuckles] All right.
-Yes! Yes.

06:50.410 --> 06:51.715
Let's-let's keep this
between us.

06:51.759 --> 06:53.282
[whispers]:
Of course. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

06:53.325 --> 06:54.718
-Nice, nice.
-I won't tell them.

06:54.762 --> 06:56.241
I-I'm terrified. I don't feel

06:56.285 --> 06:57.808
like touching anything
in Mac's room.

06:57.852 --> 06:59.810
-Hey, don't touch the bike.
-I'm not going near that.

06:59.854 --> 07:01.682
-Okay, all right.
-But we can't let them beat us.

07:01.725 --> 07:03.161
-Frank, Frank, Frank. Frank.
-Just look. We don't...

07:03.205 --> 07:04.641
Look no further.

07:04.685 --> 07:06.817
-'Cause when I was out there...
-Hmm?

07:06.861 --> 07:08.297
...I already found one.

07:08.340 --> 07:10.255
Great! You didn't-you didn't
tell them.

07:10.299 --> 07:11.648
No, I'm not gonna tell them.

07:11.692 --> 07:14.042
Because the most important
aspect of a man's success

07:14.085 --> 07:16.523
is to never trust another man.

07:16.566 --> 07:18.046
-For sure, yeah.
-Okay, well, w-what is it?

07:18.089 --> 07:19.830
-All right, check it out.
-Hmm?

07:19.874 --> 07:23.573
A heart-shaped key.

07:23.617 --> 07:25.009
-Oh!
-[chuckles]

07:29.797 --> 07:30.928
DEE:
Ugh!

07:30.972 --> 07:33.061
Goddamn!
Sons of bitches.

07:33.104 --> 07:34.671
Amanda, what's
the protocol when a team

07:34.715 --> 07:36.499
locks one of their team members
in another room?

07:36.543 --> 07:37.674
AMANDA [on walkie-talkie]:
I have no idea.

07:37.718 --> 07:39.328
This has never happened before.

07:39.371 --> 07:40.677
All right, well,
what are they doing out there?

07:40.721 --> 07:42.853
Not much. They've basically
just been arguing

07:42.897 --> 07:44.638
about which one is in charge
this whole time.

07:44.681 --> 07:45.856
All right, well, have they found
the heart-shaped

07:45.900 --> 07:47.510
-lock and key yet?
-They have, but they

07:47.554 --> 07:49.381
refuse to admit it to one...

07:49.425 --> 07:51.688
Wait, how did you know
about that clue?

07:51.732 --> 07:55.387
Ooh, yeah, yeah. I've done this
exact same escape room before.

07:55.431 --> 07:56.693
Yeah, that's why I picked it.

07:56.737 --> 07:59.566
I wanted to show them that
I'm smart and I can solve stuff.

07:59.609 --> 08:01.524
-By cheating your way through
a game you've already played?
-Okay, don't

08:01.568 --> 08:02.786
judge me, nerd.
All right? I don't need that.

08:02.830 --> 08:04.571
What I need is for you
to get me out there

08:04.614 --> 08:07.008
-so I can solve puzzles
and be a star.
-Okay, well, again,

08:07.051 --> 08:09.314
this is a team-building
exercise.

08:09.358 --> 08:11.534
Perhaps if you could tell them
about the lock and the key,

08:11.578 --> 08:12.883
they'd let you out of the room.

08:12.927 --> 08:15.582
Oh, yeah, right. I'm sure--
and give them the satisfaction

08:15.625 --> 08:18.106
of unlocking it? No, thanks.
Now, come on, sister.

08:18.149 --> 08:19.760
We got-we got to stick together

08:19.803 --> 08:21.675
and solve this problem
the way women do.

08:21.718 --> 08:23.677
Let's approach it
like women. Right?

08:23.720 --> 08:27.158
Through cooperation we can find
a way to emasculate the men

08:27.202 --> 08:28.986
whose attention we're seeking.

08:29.030 --> 08:30.466
I don't feel
comfortable with this.

08:30.510 --> 08:32.337
Let's see how comfortable
you feel in five minutes,

08:32.381 --> 08:34.601
when they get frustrated and
start smashing all your shit.

08:40.998 --> 08:43.566
It's not in here.

08:43.610 --> 08:44.698
Yeah. Nope. Here either.
You now what?

08:44.741 --> 08:46.134
Let's-let's just...
let's stop.

08:46.177 --> 08:48.789
Let's just... Okay. We've
smashed a lot of things here,

08:48.832 --> 08:50.225
and I'm not seeing a single key,

08:50.268 --> 08:52.357
which means the key's
got to be in your room

08:52.401 --> 08:54.925
with Charlie and Frank.
Now... Oh, damn it, Mac.

08:54.969 --> 08:57.406
Stop-stop chewing so loudly.

08:57.449 --> 08:58.755
I'm not chewing anything.

08:58.799 --> 08:59.930
Well, I can't think. Okay?

08:59.974 --> 09:01.802
I hear you chewing,
and I can't think.

09:01.845 --> 09:03.151
I don't have anything
in my mouth.

09:03.194 --> 09:06.633
Oh, Jesus.

09:06.676 --> 09:09.636
That's Frank in the other room.
[scoffs]

09:09.679 --> 09:11.725
You know what that is, right?

09:11.768 --> 09:15.380
That's a power play.

09:15.424 --> 09:17.382
Frank's trying to assert
his dominance over me.

09:17.426 --> 09:18.732
It's a classic alpha move.

09:18.775 --> 09:21.430
-Oh, my God, it is?
-Yeah. Yeah.

09:21.473 --> 09:22.823
No, no, no.
Don't sit. Don't sit.

09:22.866 --> 09:25.303
-Oh, sorry.
-[sighs] You see,

09:25.347 --> 09:27.175
by constantly chewing so loudly,

09:27.218 --> 09:30.221
he's sending a very clear
message that he is the head cow.

09:30.265 --> 09:31.614
And, as we all know,

09:31.658 --> 09:35.226
the head cow's always grazing.

09:36.880 --> 09:40.014
Aren't all cows female?

09:41.711 --> 09:44.496
Well, that was a metaphor.
Okay, you know... [sighs]

09:44.540 --> 09:45.846
Mac, sometimes I'm just riffing.

09:45.889 --> 09:47.456
Would you allow me to riff?

09:47.499 --> 09:49.501
As the leader, can I riff?
Can I riff?!

09:49.545 --> 09:52.330
-Ye-Yes, yes, yes. Yes.
-All right, so the point is

09:52.374 --> 09:54.419
go get me some of that gum.

09:54.463 --> 09:56.770
That was the point
you were making? You want gum?

09:56.813 --> 09:58.685
Well, yes, I need the gum.
It sends a very important,

09:58.728 --> 10:01.862
subconscious cue that
sets the tone for pack animals.

10:01.905 --> 10:04.081
I need to assert myself
to this monkey

10:04.125 --> 10:05.648
so that he'll submit to my will,

10:05.692 --> 10:08.520
and we can win the game and
get the hell out of this place.

10:08.564 --> 10:10.871
I'm so sorry, Dennis.
I'm very confused...

10:10.914 --> 10:12.481
Don't sit down!

10:14.526 --> 10:15.658
Yes. Um...

10:15.702 --> 10:19.053
Just a clarifying question:
are-are we monkeys or cows?

10:19.096 --> 10:21.272
We're whatever the hell
I say we are, okay?

10:21.316 --> 10:23.927
I'm just riffing.
Now will you go get my gum?

10:23.971 --> 10:25.059
Yes.

10:26.103 --> 10:28.671
Anything?

10:28.715 --> 10:30.673
No. Nothing.

10:30.717 --> 10:33.023
Well, keep smashing,
because whatever lock

10:33.067 --> 10:35.852
goes on the end of this key has
got to be in here, somewhere.

10:35.896 --> 10:38.463
I've smashed everything,
I can't find it.

10:38.507 --> 10:39.595
-Hey, guys. How's it going?
-Super great.

10:39.639 --> 10:40.944
-Super awesome, dude.
-Yeah. Really good.

10:40.988 --> 10:42.337
Super great. We're finding
all sorts of cool stuff.

10:42.380 --> 10:44.252
You know, probably gonna be
out of this room in no time.

10:44.295 --> 10:45.470
My leader's killing it
over here.

10:45.514 --> 10:47.037
-You touched the bike?
-No, I didn't your bike.

10:47.081 --> 10:48.473
Didn't touch a thing in here
that was yours, man.

10:48.517 --> 10:49.518
Didn't touch one of your
gross things.

10:49.561 --> 10:51.259
-What's up?
-Nah. You guys cool?

10:51.302 --> 10:52.956
-Yeah, we're cool.
What's up with you?
-Huh? We're good.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.392
-I'm so cool.
-What do you want?

10:54.436 --> 10:56.133
-What do you want?
What do you want?
-Yeah, what's up?

10:56.177 --> 10:57.526
-What do you want?
-What's up? What's up?

10:57.569 --> 10:59.528
-Dennis wants some gum.
-Oh, all right. Hang on a sec...

10:59.571 --> 11:00.834
-No, no. Don't do that.
-What?

11:00.877 --> 11:02.139
-That's a power play, Charlie.
-It is?

11:02.183 --> 11:03.706
-Yeah.
-How is it a power play?

11:03.750 --> 11:04.968
It's a power play. Everybody
knows that the head cow

11:05.012 --> 11:06.796
is always grazing.

11:06.840 --> 11:08.755
-Oh, that's true.
-Wait, so that's, like,
a real thing?

11:08.798 --> 11:10.495
-Yeah. That's what it is.
-Makes sense.
If you're a top cow, what,

11:10.539 --> 11:12.541
-are you gonna not eat?
-Now, I'm sorry,
we can't help you.

11:12.584 --> 11:14.717
A-All right.
Well... I have info.

11:14.761 --> 11:15.849
All right, well,
what's your info?

11:15.892 --> 11:17.285
First, give me some gum
for Dennis.

11:17.328 --> 11:19.156
Oh, hardball, huh?
Okay, I'll tell you what.

11:19.200 --> 11:20.418
No, no, don't, don't, don't...

11:20.462 --> 11:22.682
I'm gonna give you one shred.

11:25.380 --> 11:28.775
-Ooh! Oh, not cool dude!
-Oh, I knew he was
gonna do that.

11:28.818 --> 11:30.951
I just didn't want to feel weak
in front of Frank.

11:30.994 --> 11:32.735
I-I want to be
a big-deal cow, too.

11:32.779 --> 11:33.997
Well, now I want to be
a big-deal cow, and I want gum.

11:34.041 --> 11:36.130
But don't eat
all my gum, Charlie.

11:36.173 --> 11:37.871
All right, well, what's your
info? What'd you find out?

11:37.914 --> 11:39.829
-I found a clue.
-What is it?

11:39.873 --> 11:41.570
Give me some more gum
for Dennis.

11:41.613 --> 11:43.006
-No. I don't trust you.
-Why not?

11:43.050 --> 11:44.878
'Cause you're just gonna put it
in your mouth and eat it again.

11:44.921 --> 11:46.096
I won't.
I promise.

11:46.140 --> 11:48.751
Mm. His neck is high.
Makes me trust him.

11:48.795 --> 11:51.841
Good posture, bro.
Okay. All right, I trust you.

11:53.800 --> 11:54.801
-Ooh!
-Aah!

11:54.844 --> 11:57.020
-I knew he couldn't be trusted.
-Oh, not cool, man.

11:57.064 --> 11:59.762
Never trust another man in
a negotiation, that's textbook.

11:59.806 --> 12:01.111
Art of the Deal.
Art of the Deal,bro.

12:01.155 --> 12:02.809
Oh, you tried to tell me that.
All right, Art of the Deal.

12:02.852 --> 12:04.332
Art of the Deal,
Art of the Deal.

12:04.375 --> 12:05.681
Hey, look, we're getting
somewhere, right?

12:05.725 --> 12:07.335
We're in negotiation.
That-that's good.

12:07.378 --> 12:09.250
-That's good, men being men.
-What do you got?

12:09.293 --> 12:11.165
All right, well,
tell-tell us what the clue is.

12:11.208 --> 12:12.819
Why would I tell you?
You already gave me what I want.

12:12.862 --> 12:14.168
Because we both know
what Dennis'll do to you

12:14.211 --> 12:16.779
if you come back empty-handed--
he will scratch you silly, Mac.

12:19.086 --> 12:20.000
Killer negotiation, man.

12:20.043 --> 12:21.871
-Holy shit!
-Yeah. Pretty sweet, right?

12:21.915 --> 12:23.612
-Art of the Deal.
-Art of the Deal.
-He was lying.

12:23.655 --> 12:24.700
So what's up,
what'd you find?

12:24.744 --> 12:27.616
I got this.

12:28.965 --> 12:31.489
I think it's time for a summit.

12:37.931 --> 12:40.629
Thank you for coming
to my summit.

12:40.672 --> 12:42.022
Well, it's not your summit.
It's everyone's summit.

12:42.065 --> 12:43.197
That's what a summit is.

12:43.240 --> 12:45.895
The point is
we're here to discuss

12:45.939 --> 12:47.941
the terms of your surrender.

12:47.984 --> 12:50.247
Our surrender?
Why would we surrender to you?

12:50.291 --> 12:52.380
We know you have
the heart-shaped lock.

12:52.423 --> 12:54.817
Goddamn it, Mac!
You told them?!

12:54.861 --> 12:55.949
-[exclaims]
-Ooh!

12:55.992 --> 12:56.993
And we have all the leverage,

12:57.037 --> 12:59.082
because we have
something you need,

12:59.126 --> 13:00.431
and we're not gonna
tell you what.

13:00.475 --> 13:02.216
The key?

13:04.218 --> 13:05.480
-Yeah.
-Okay,

13:05.523 --> 13:07.047
so there goes your leverage.

13:07.090 --> 13:08.048
Yeah.

13:08.091 --> 13:09.832
Oh, no, I don't think so.

13:09.876 --> 13:12.443
For you cannot open a lock
without a key.

13:12.487 --> 13:15.185
And you can't do anything
with just a key.

13:15.229 --> 13:17.797
It appears we're
at a standstill.

13:21.061 --> 13:23.324
Yeah.

13:23.367 --> 13:25.674
-Yeah.
-By the way, is anybody
else wondering

13:25.717 --> 13:29.460
why we haven't heard Dee
make a peep this entire time?

13:31.680 --> 13:34.291
Goddamn it, you guys!

13:34.335 --> 13:35.858
Why is no one answering me?!

13:35.902 --> 13:37.860
AMANDA: I don't even think
they can hear you.

13:37.904 --> 13:38.992
Is there a chance
your brother would've

13:39.035 --> 13:42.256
sound-proofed his room
for some reason?

13:42.299 --> 13:45.912
Ugh... Oh, no.

13:45.955 --> 13:49.089
Oh, God. Yeah. Yeah, there is.

13:49.132 --> 13:51.004
Oh, Dennis, you psychopath.

13:51.047 --> 13:52.440
How long have I been
locked in here?

13:52.483 --> 13:54.007
-[rapid beeping]
-What the...

13:54.050 --> 13:56.009
-â™ª
-DENNIS [on laptop]:
Welcome, sexual conquest.

13:56.052 --> 13:58.098
As previously discussed,
you've pressed the button

13:58.141 --> 13:59.882
on the alarm clock,
signifying your permission

13:59.926 --> 14:01.231
to begin the game.

14:01.275 --> 14:02.929
-Ew.
-A digital copy
of your thumbprint

14:02.972 --> 14:05.105
has been sent
as your e-signature

14:05.148 --> 14:07.020
confirming your full consent

14:07.063 --> 14:09.674
-for whatever
may happen to you.
-Oh, God.

14:09.718 --> 14:11.546
We've also discussed
the safe word.

14:11.589 --> 14:14.070
Feel free to use it
at any time...

14:14.114 --> 14:17.465
but, as we both know,
from your Craigslist profile,

14:17.508 --> 14:19.728
you probably won't.

14:19.771 --> 14:21.077
Good luck.

14:21.121 --> 14:24.776
[exclaims]
Oh! Oh, no!

14:24.820 --> 14:26.126
-Oh, my God. No, no, no.
-DENNIS: Remember,

14:26.169 --> 14:28.041
-Come on, Dennis. -if you're having too much fun,

14:28.084 --> 14:30.086
-it ruins it for me.
-Wh...

14:30.130 --> 14:31.958
Ah, ah, ah.

14:32.001 --> 14:34.047
You didn't say the safe word.

14:34.090 --> 14:35.526
Goddamn it, Dennis.

14:35.570 --> 14:37.006
AMANDA:
This is insanely disturbing.

14:37.050 --> 14:38.051
All right, you do it
for a living.

14:38.094 --> 14:39.791
Get off your high horse.

14:39.835 --> 14:42.490
-Dennis! Oh, no.
-AMANDA: Okay, okay,

14:42.533 --> 14:44.274
maybe I can help you
unlock the door after all.

14:44.318 --> 14:46.624
What do you see in the room?
What's the first clue?

14:46.668 --> 14:48.191
No, no, you don't get it.

14:48.235 --> 14:50.063
There's no going
out that door, all right?

14:50.106 --> 14:52.500
I-I know my brother
better than anybody else.

14:52.543 --> 14:54.371
The fact that his prisoner
cannot escape

14:54.415 --> 14:55.938
is really
what's getting him off.

14:55.982 --> 14:57.374
[sighs]

14:57.418 --> 15:00.029
Without that safe word there's
only one way out of this room.

15:00.073 --> 15:02.597
And that's doing
something drastic.

15:08.255 --> 15:10.561
[all mumbling indistinctly]

15:10.605 --> 15:12.781
-[laughs, mutters]
-And no decision upon us.

15:12.824 --> 15:15.958
So I will tarry forth
with what we've said about...

15:16.002 --> 15:19.048
Oh, gentlemen, uh,
gentlemen, if I may.

15:19.092 --> 15:22.095
As your newly elected speaker,
I'd like to start by saying

15:22.138 --> 15:24.662
I henceforth
relinquish any possibility

15:24.706 --> 15:26.882
of becoming team leader
from myself.

15:26.926 --> 15:30.103
So long as I am able
to retain this excellent title,

15:30.146 --> 15:32.105
as speaker of the tribe.

15:32.148 --> 15:33.802
Uh, do we all agree
to these terms?

15:33.845 --> 15:35.369
Uh, yeah.

15:37.806 --> 15:40.374
Then, as the time in the game
is drawing close to an end,

15:40.417 --> 15:42.854
as is the flavor of our gum,

15:42.898 --> 15:46.075
I shall commence with the terms
we've all discussed posthaste.

15:46.119 --> 15:48.121
As we all know, we men possess

15:48.164 --> 15:51.559
both the lock and the key.

15:51.602 --> 15:55.215
The turning of said lock and key
shall give us the code

15:55.258 --> 15:58.218
to open that door
and render us victorious.

15:58.261 --> 16:02.352
The turner of said key should
and shall be our team leader.

16:02.396 --> 16:04.224
So the election of this leader

16:04.267 --> 16:08.054
is our top priority
at this time.

16:10.447 --> 16:12.275
Followed only
by the power dynamic

16:12.319 --> 16:15.235
that falls underneath
this leader.

16:17.411 --> 16:20.240
And then, lastly,
there is the matter of meat,

16:20.283 --> 16:21.632
and who among us

16:21.676 --> 16:24.461
gets to graze upon it.

16:27.290 --> 16:29.162
Too far?

16:29.205 --> 16:32.252
I'll dial it back a bit.
I'll dial it back a bit.

16:32.295 --> 16:34.602
-FRANK: Back up.
-That's very good.

16:34.645 --> 16:36.386
Frank...

16:36.430 --> 16:39.172
as the purchaser of the meat
upon our imminent victory,

16:39.215 --> 16:42.871
you have offered to award
each one of us with our own

16:42.914 --> 16:46.440
20-ounce sirloin steak,

16:46.483 --> 16:48.268
provided you bite yours first.

16:48.311 --> 16:50.183
Is this correct?

16:50.226 --> 16:51.836
Correct.

16:51.880 --> 16:54.839
Now, Dennis,
as the possessor of the lock,

16:54.883 --> 16:57.059
albeit through
unscrupulous methods,

16:57.103 --> 17:00.106
let us not have another scratch.

17:00.149 --> 17:03.065
You shall bite your steak
second, followed by Mac,

17:03.109 --> 17:05.067
the original finder of the lock.

17:05.111 --> 17:09.898
And lastly, me, for I picked
the shortest of the straws.

17:09.941 --> 17:13.249
It was unfortunate, but you were
all kind enough to grant me

17:13.293 --> 17:15.991
the speaker position as to stop
the incessant arguing

17:16.035 --> 17:19.081
that took place upon
the picking of straws.

17:19.125 --> 17:20.213
FRANK:
Yeah.

17:20.256 --> 17:21.736
Do we all agree to these terms?

17:21.779 --> 17:24.652
Very good. Very good.

17:24.695 --> 17:27.220
Then, gentlemen, on the count
of three, we shall dispense

17:27.263 --> 17:30.658
of our chewables and commence
with the turning of the key.

17:30.701 --> 17:33.095
One...

17:33.139 --> 17:35.663
two...

17:35.706 --> 17:37.273
three.

17:37.317 --> 17:39.884
Gentlemen, I will remind you

17:39.928 --> 17:43.279
that time is of the essence.

17:47.022 --> 17:48.110
Very good.

17:48.154 --> 17:51.896
Frank, the lock and the key.

17:51.940 --> 17:55.117
But before he opens it,
I'd like to take a brief moment

17:55.161 --> 17:57.206
to recognize
our excellent work as men...

17:57.250 --> 17:59.382
-FRANK: Mm.
-navigating these
difficult waters

17:59.426 --> 18:01.558
with ethics, with grace,

18:01.602 --> 18:03.778
with minimal violence.

18:03.821 --> 18:06.737
But, above all,
without compromise

18:06.781 --> 18:10.698
to our masculine identity
by any admission of guilt,

18:10.741 --> 18:13.135
failure or weakness.

18:13.179 --> 18:15.311
-[laughing]
-Hear, hear.

18:16.530 --> 18:18.923
Ah, to us as men.

18:18.967 --> 18:21.274
Ah, to us as men. Frank,
uh, lead us to our victory.

18:21.317 --> 18:23.189
Men.

18:25.191 --> 18:26.409
Hmm.

18:26.453 --> 18:28.324
-There's something inside.
-DENNIS: Uh...

18:28.368 --> 18:31.371
-What is it? What is it?
-A note.
-Ah!

18:31.414 --> 18:34.374
-What does the note say?
-[Charlie laughing]

18:34.417 --> 18:38.856
"And so the game begins."

18:42.033 --> 18:43.034
What?!

18:44.862 --> 18:46.951
I-I think this is
only the first clue.

18:46.995 --> 18:49.389
Oh, oh, shit.
There's a whole

18:49.432 --> 18:51.086
shitload of instructions

18:51.130 --> 18:52.957
-on what to do next.
-DENNIS: No, no, no.

18:53.001 --> 18:55.221
-Next? H-How many things
do we have to do next?
-CHARLIE: Yeah, what is that?

18:55.264 --> 18:57.788
-Well, well, 20, 30...?
-Uh...

18:57.832 --> 18:59.399
There's like a hundred in there.

18:59.442 --> 19:01.531
-FRANK: Oh, shit.
-20, 30? How much time
do we have left?

19:01.575 --> 19:03.316
-Oh, no, no, no.
-Two minutes.

19:03.359 --> 19:04.578
-Two minutes?
-Two minutes.

19:04.621 --> 19:06.188
-We don't have time
to do all those things.
-Oh, no!

19:06.232 --> 19:07.755
Frank, Frank, you're in charge.

19:07.798 --> 19:09.583
-What do we do?
-I don't know what to do!
-DEE: You assholes!

19:09.626 --> 19:11.193
-Let me in!
-MAC: Holy shit.

19:11.237 --> 19:13.021
-Dee's out on the ledge.
-She got out of your room.

19:13.064 --> 19:14.544
-Clever girl.
-CHARLIE: Dee!
-DEE: Come on!

19:14.588 --> 19:17.547
Come on, you son of a bitch.
Let me in. I can help you.

19:17.591 --> 19:19.027
-Dee...
-I can get you out of there!
-Dee, be careful.

19:19.070 --> 19:20.202
-That ledge is really small.
-Just let me in.

19:21.595 --> 19:23.205
Stop! Stop the game!

19:23.249 --> 19:24.554
She's gonna fall!
Let her in!

19:24.598 --> 19:26.774
You guys, you have to...
[shouts, screams]

19:26.817 --> 19:30.299
-[all shout]
-Oh, shit!
-[thump, glass shattering]

19:31.866 --> 19:33.824
I am so sorry that
this happened to you.

19:33.868 --> 19:35.435
We've never had
an injury before.

19:35.478 --> 19:37.263
Well, I'll sue the shit
out of them, Amanda.

19:37.306 --> 19:39.090
I'm gonna do it.
I hate them.

19:39.134 --> 19:41.049
Okay? I-I... If they just
would've listened to me.

19:41.092 --> 19:42.833
-I knew how to help them get...
-[guys chanting]:
Dee! Dee! Dee! Dee!

19:42.877 --> 19:44.661
-Oh, there she is! There she is!
-Hey!

19:44.705 --> 19:47.577
-Oh, my God. Woo!
-Dee! Dee! Dee! Dee!
-There's our girl.

19:47.621 --> 19:49.884
Oh, yeah. Hey, guys.

19:49.927 --> 19:51.886
Yeah, Dee, you outsmarted them.

19:51.929 --> 19:53.366
-You won the game.
-Yeah.

19:53.409 --> 19:55.019
You took a fall for the boys.

19:55.063 --> 19:56.238
A-And you know what?
That's what a quarterback does.

19:56.282 --> 20:00.111
Sacrifices his-- or her--
body for the team.

20:00.155 --> 20:01.461
-You really were
the quarterback.
-I was...

20:01.504 --> 20:03.463
-I was the quarterback, right?
-Absolutely.

20:03.506 --> 20:05.378
Yeah, you sure were.
Yeah, no, you figured out

20:05.421 --> 20:07.293
the only loophole
in my carefully curated

20:07.336 --> 20:09.469
and well-researched
bondage facility.

20:09.512 --> 20:11.471
You're the only person
who's ever done that.

20:11.514 --> 20:13.647
-Really?
-Yeah, the only one.
The only one.

20:13.690 --> 20:16.171
Yeah, game nerd.
Now, take the picture.

20:16.215 --> 20:18.260
-What are you talking about?
-Oh, y-you said

20:18.304 --> 20:21.045
if we worked as a team
and we escaped from the room,

20:21.089 --> 20:23.526
-then you would take
our photo for your website.
-DEE: Yeah.

20:23.570 --> 20:25.136
But you didn't work as a team.

20:25.180 --> 20:26.268
-Yeah, no, no,
yeah-yeah, we did.
-Yeah, yeah.

20:26.312 --> 20:28.488
Yeah, absolutely we did,
'cause we-we got

20:28.531 --> 20:29.619
-out of the room.
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

20:29.663 --> 20:31.273
Yeah, because I let you out.

20:31.317 --> 20:34.276
Oh, yeah, but it was
before the timer went off,

20:34.320 --> 20:37.497
and you didn't specify how we
get out, just that we get out.

20:37.540 --> 20:39.542
-Yeah, that's on you, really.
-Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

20:39.586 --> 20:40.848
-That's not on us. Okay?
-Yep.

20:40.891 --> 20:42.153
-Take the picture.
-I don't see the problem here.

20:42.197 --> 20:43.285
Just take the picture.

20:43.329 --> 20:44.504
-Okay.
-Yeah, but, wait, wait, wait!

20:44.547 --> 20:46.114
Wait, before you do that.

20:46.157 --> 20:48.290
-Uh, Frank got steaks.
-Yeah.
-Steaks for everybody.

20:48.334 --> 20:49.465
-Oh! Steaks.
-MAC: Yay!

20:49.509 --> 20:52.642
Yeah, everybody
gets one, but Dee...

20:52.686 --> 20:55.428
you get to bite first.

20:55.471 --> 20:57.473
Oh, wow.

20:59.910 --> 21:01.347
Thanks, guys.

21:01.390 --> 21:03.349
All right,
take the picture, loser.

21:03.392 --> 21:04.524
-Yeah.
-Yeah, let's go, let's go.

21:04.567 --> 21:06.308
[laughing]

21:06.352 --> 21:07.309
One, two, three!

21:07.353 --> 21:09.180
ALL:
Cheese!
