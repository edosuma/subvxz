14:00.265 --> 14:02.233
Hope doesn't need a wolf army.

14:02.234 --> 14:03.979
I'll protect her myself,

14:04.079 --> 14:05.570
and an easy time
I'll have of it, too,

14:05.571 --> 14:07.271
without you running off
sharing secrets

14:07.272 --> 14:09.907
with every motley member
of your werewolf brethren.

14:09.908 --> 14:13.110
Damn it, Klaus.
This is our chance.

14:13.111 --> 14:17.448
We can bring her home.

14:17.449 --> 14:19.703
We have to at least
consider this.

14:19.803 --> 14:23.254
I have considered it,
and I have deemed it absurd,

14:23.255 --> 14:24.655
and in this matter,
there is no one

14:24.656 --> 14:26.460
above my decree, not even you.

14:29.293 --> 14:33.467
You will tell Jackson
the wedding is off.

14:34.765 --> 14:38.969
It's a good thing that I don't
take orders from anyone,

14:38.970 --> 14:41.538
especially not from you.

14:48.779 --> 14:51.277
So much for having
a secret lair.

14:51.377 --> 14:53.684
Don't mind him. Did you bring
the stuff I asked for?

14:53.685 --> 14:57.353
Yeah. This is everything
Josh left at my place.

14:59.490 --> 15:02.830
Ah, practically
moved in, has he?

15:02.930 --> 15:06.500
Davina: Kol, please shut up.

15:10.033 --> 15:12.202
Ok. Here we go.

15:12.203 --> 15:13.303
All right.
Come on, then.

15:13.304 --> 15:14.425
Channel me.
It'll be quicker.

15:14.525 --> 15:16.306
Come on.

15:16.307 --> 15:18.308
[Clears throat]

15:18.309 --> 15:20.743
[Chanting in french]

15:29.052 --> 15:31.989
Right here, the street corner.

15:31.990 --> 15:33.457
Oh, yeah.
I know where.

15:33.458 --> 15:35.359
It's the little bodega
the witch Lenore

15:35.360 --> 15:37.527
used to run before my mother
hijacked her body.

15:37.528 --> 15:39.062
Great. Thank you for the help.

15:39.063 --> 15:41.364
Wait. What?
You can't go alone.

15:41.365 --> 15:43.333
Well, to be
absolutely clear here,

15:43.334 --> 15:46.303
technically, he definitely
could go alone.

15:46.304 --> 15:47.537
No.
It's a suicide mission.

15:47.538 --> 15:49.306
Yeah, and what's more
tragic than a suicide

15:49.307 --> 15:51.241
mission but a mass
suicide mission?

15:51.242 --> 15:52.776
I'm not leaving Josh
trapped with a nutjob

15:52.777 --> 15:55.278
that hates vampires.

15:55.279 --> 15:57.579
Neither am I.

16:11.294 --> 16:12.794
[Creak]

16:19.369 --> 16:22.660
[Creak]

16:35.124 --> 16:37.152
Aah!

16:42.936 --> 16:44.504
I'm done listening to you.

16:44.505 --> 16:46.506
Let me know when you want
to have a real conversation.

16:46.507 --> 16:47.541
Hayley!

16:47.542 --> 16:48.809
I'm not gonna stand here quietly

16:48.810 --> 16:50.510
while you tell me what
I can and cannot do

16:50.511 --> 16:51.545
to protect my daughter.

16:51.546 --> 16:53.480
Our daughter.
Right.

16:53.481 --> 16:57.451
Ours, but it was your mother
who tried to kill her,

16:57.452 --> 17:00.220
and who knows what your equally
psychotic brother is up to?

17:00.221 --> 17:01.521
I will deal with Finn.

17:01.522 --> 17:02.533
And then what?

17:02.633 --> 17:04.523
Hope will always be the daughter

17:04.525 --> 17:08.662
of Klaus Mikaelson, the hybrid
killer with 1,000 enemies.

17:08.663 --> 17:12.265
Don't you get it?
It's you.

17:12.266 --> 17:14.920
You're the threat.

17:15.020 --> 17:17.537
You're so paranoid
that you can't see

17:17.538 --> 17:20.675
that this wedding can help her.

17:20.776 --> 17:22.509
She can come home.

17:22.510 --> 17:23.742
The wolves will be on our side.

17:23.743 --> 17:25.578
The wolves cannot be trusted.

17:25.579 --> 17:28.381
In your paranoid mind,
nobody can be trusted.

17:28.382 --> 17:29.516
Where does it end?

17:29.517 --> 17:31.184
There is no end!

17:31.185 --> 17:33.553
Need I remind you
I killed my own father

17:33.554 --> 17:35.482
in order to protect her?

17:35.582 --> 17:39.625
Really? That's why
you killed him...

17:42.228 --> 17:45.565
Or is it just that you
were so terrified

17:45.566 --> 17:49.163
of letting someone, anyone, in?

17:51.671 --> 17:55.440
I know this wedding can work.

17:56.609 --> 18:01.581
We can bring our
little girl home,

18:01.582 --> 18:04.303
but you have to trust me.

18:09.455 --> 18:13.959
I do trust you,
more than you know.

18:16.596 --> 18:18.598
Uh!
[Snap]

18:18.599 --> 18:21.737
I just don't trust Jackson.

18:26.239 --> 18:28.874
You can't free yourself.

18:28.875 --> 18:34.547
Those ropes have been
soaked in vervain.

18:34.548 --> 18:37.616
But I did lessen the spell
that made you hungry,

18:37.617 --> 18:42.341
affording us an opportunity
for some civilized discourse.

18:47.426 --> 18:50.629
Let's start with our
mutual friend Camille.

18:50.630 --> 18:52.598
The topic that consumed
the majority

18:52.599 --> 18:54.500
of our time together
was her troubled

18:54.501 --> 18:57.856
relationship with Niklaus.

18:57.956 --> 19:00.639
He confided in her, but she knew

19:00.640 --> 19:03.195
nothing that I could
use against him,

19:03.295 --> 19:07.913
and yet recently, I had occasion
to speak with my brother,

19:07.914 --> 19:12.518
and I realized that
he has a secret,

19:12.519 --> 19:15.587
one that he is
desperate to protect,

19:15.588 --> 19:21.326
and I think that that secret
is a weakness.

19:21.327 --> 19:28.095
So tell me, Marcel,
what is it?

19:28.195 --> 19:30.635
You really think
that he trusts me

19:30.636 --> 19:33.071
with anything that could
be used against him?

19:33.072 --> 19:38.677
You're Klaus' ally, and I think
you know something.

19:38.678 --> 19:40.774
You can think whatever you want

19:40.874 --> 19:44.516
as long as you don't mind
knowing that you are a chump.

19:44.517 --> 19:47.552
[Blows] Aah!

19:47.553 --> 19:50.622
Uh! Ah!

19:50.623 --> 19:54.859
Tell me what you know.

19:54.860 --> 19:57.529
[Panting]

19:57.530 --> 19:59.960
I'll tell you what I remember.

20:02.667 --> 20:04.803
Two centuries back,

20:04.804 --> 20:07.005
I was just a kid looking
through the compound.

20:07.006 --> 20:08.640
I found a coffin.

20:08.641 --> 20:14.579
Klaus catches me, and he says,
"that's my brother Finn.

20:14.580 --> 20:18.683
We keep him like that
because he is such a bore."

20:18.684 --> 20:21.815
[Blows] Aah!

20:23.588 --> 20:25.757
Rebekah?
[Gasps]

20:25.758 --> 20:29.527
Are you trying to give me
a bloody heart attack?

20:29.528 --> 20:33.498
Is it still beautiful,
New Orleans?

20:33.499 --> 20:37.435
I loved it so much
the last time I saw it.

20:37.436 --> 20:39.570
New Orleans will remain a beauty

20:39.571 --> 20:41.939
long after you and I are
bones beneath its clay.

20:41.940 --> 20:44.041
For now, you have to go
back to your room.

20:44.042 --> 20:46.110
I've got things to do.

20:46.111 --> 20:50.581
Why are you here in this place?

20:50.582 --> 20:53.084
[Sighs]

20:53.085 --> 20:57.021
I was trying to help
my brothers.

20:57.022 --> 20:59.457
My con artist of
a blood relation Kol

20:59.458 --> 21:03.427
betrayed me, got me
stuck in here.

21:03.428 --> 21:05.630
Oh, when I get hold of him...

21:05.631 --> 21:08.699
Why do you fight
with your own family?

21:08.700 --> 21:10.614
You should stand beside them.

21:13.104 --> 21:20.123
It's... complicated,
1,000 years complicated.

21:27.651 --> 21:29.753
Listen.

21:29.754 --> 21:31.655
I think I found a way
out of this hell hole.

21:31.656 --> 21:32.723
If you want to come with,

21:32.724 --> 21:34.091
meet me at the front
door in 20 minutes.

21:34.092 --> 21:37.391
Either way, wish me luck.

21:46.437 --> 21:49.111
For Klaus in case he comes back.

21:50.574 --> 21:53.991
Klaus: Speak the devil's name,
et cetera, et cetera.

21:55.913 --> 21:59.783
I wonder if Jackson
can come out to play.

21:59.784 --> 22:03.553
It's ok.

22:04.855 --> 22:07.090
Where's Hayley?
Resting.

22:07.091 --> 22:09.526
She was exhausted
after your grueling day

22:09.527 --> 22:12.029
of wedding preparations,
poor thing.

22:12.030 --> 22:13.630
No matter.

22:13.631 --> 22:15.532
Gives us a chance to chat.

22:15.533 --> 22:18.702
I want your word this
is between me and you.

22:18.703 --> 22:19.803
Why, of course.

22:19.804 --> 22:21.768
You have my word as a gentleman.

22:31.545 --> 22:34.031
Brave lad.

22:39.322 --> 22:41.156
Uh!

22:43.893 --> 22:45.834
Klaus!

22:45.934 --> 22:49.932
You want to fight me, come on!

22:51.735 --> 22:55.071
You mistake my intentions.

22:55.072 --> 22:58.808
I haven't come here
to fight you, not at all.

22:58.809 --> 23:02.912
This is to be an execution.

23:02.913 --> 23:06.646
Tell me, how, exactly,
would you like to die?

23:15.207 --> 23:16.243
Agh!

23:16.244 --> 23:19.868
Most of my victims start
screaming about now.

23:21.655 --> 23:24.138
I'd prefer if you
spared me the tedium

23:24.139 --> 23:26.707
of any last words, but
if you are so inclined,

23:26.708 --> 23:28.843
now would be the time.

23:28.844 --> 23:30.211
Go to hell, you bastard.

23:30.212 --> 23:31.879
Bastard. Yes.

23:31.880 --> 23:34.015
That is exactly what I am,

23:34.016 --> 23:37.685
made so by your
precious mentor Ansel.

23:37.686 --> 23:39.987
I'm curious.

23:39.988 --> 23:43.824
Did he teach you to regard
me with such loathing,

23:43.825 --> 23:45.960
or is that bias all of your own?

23:45.961 --> 23:48.195
Is that what this is about?

23:48.196 --> 23:51.799
You jealous I got to
spend time with your daddy?

23:51.800 --> 23:54.835
You were his most prized pupil,

23:54.836 --> 23:57.872
the benefactor to
all of his wisdom.

23:57.873 --> 23:59.139
Uh!

23:59.140 --> 24:01.075
Look at all the good
it's done you.

24:01.076 --> 24:02.942
Uh!

24:05.913 --> 24:09.149
Well, you...

24:09.150 --> 24:11.552
Could've learned
from him yourself,

24:11.553 --> 24:14.221
uh, if only you
hadn't killed him.

24:14.222 --> 24:15.723
Uh!

24:15.724 --> 24:18.225
Oh! Oh!

24:18.226 --> 24:20.594
I see you've mastered
the self-righteous air

24:20.595 --> 24:22.729
of all hypocrites.

24:22.730 --> 24:26.200
The truth is, you're
worse than me,

24:26.201 --> 24:28.902
using Hayley's best intentions

24:28.903 --> 24:31.772
for your own
self-serving power grab.

24:31.773 --> 24:32.839
You're wrong!

24:32.840 --> 24:35.075
You want her power
so you can wage wars

24:35.076 --> 24:37.044
and win territories.

24:37.045 --> 24:40.213
After all, it's what wolves do.

24:40.214 --> 24:41.882
Gah!

24:41.883 --> 24:43.750
Uh!

24:43.751 --> 24:47.154
You don't know a damn
thing about being a wolf.

24:47.155 --> 24:50.090
No. I don't.

24:50.091 --> 24:53.794
I never had the luxury to live
among my kind nor the chance

24:53.795 --> 25:00.934
to truly know my father,
but you knew him.

25:00.935 --> 25:05.772
Perhaps he saw in you
the son he always wanted.

25:05.773 --> 25:09.478
I'm glad I was spared
such a sorry fate.

25:10.977 --> 25:13.940
Uh! Gah...

25:17.283 --> 25:19.318
I'm convinced.

25:21.654 --> 25:23.790
You know nothing, which means

25:23.791 --> 25:25.825
that whatever Klaus
is keeping secret

25:25.826 --> 25:28.962
is so secret, he won't
even share it with you.

25:28.963 --> 25:32.298
Perhaps there are other ways
you can be of use to me.

25:32.299 --> 25:35.935
[Door opens]

25:35.936 --> 25:37.804
Brother.

25:37.805 --> 25:39.372
What are you doing here, Kol?

25:39.373 --> 25:42.909
I heard a rumor that you'd taken
Marcel prisoner,

25:42.910 --> 25:47.766
and it just so happens
that I owe him.

25:50.450 --> 25:52.151
Ohh!

25:52.152 --> 25:56.021
So I am going to kill
the both of you.

25:57.056 --> 25:59.224
[Crack]

26:00.159 --> 26:04.864
You have some nerve coming here.

26:04.865 --> 26:07.800
All good grace with me was lost
the moment you signed up

26:07.801 --> 26:09.035
with our wretched siblings.

26:09.036 --> 26:10.136
You know me, Finn.

26:10.137 --> 26:12.305
I take sides with whoever
I think is gonna win,

26:12.306 --> 26:14.974
and, to be honest,
well, you and mum

26:14.975 --> 26:17.009
were acting a bit daft,
weren't you,

26:17.010 --> 26:19.845
but I heard about how
you turned dear, old dad

26:19.846 --> 26:21.814
into your own personal
black magic battery pack,

26:21.815 --> 26:28.265
and I thought, "wow,
that's cold, but it's smart."

26:30.523 --> 26:32.811
Now I can see which way
the wind is blowing,

26:32.911 --> 26:35.814
and after the way the 3
of them treated us,

26:35.914 --> 26:38.697
I'll be happy to see them
get what's coming.

26:38.698 --> 26:40.699
Aah!

26:40.700 --> 26:43.035
[Panting]

26:43.036 --> 26:44.870
What was that for?

26:44.871 --> 26:48.374
For being a duplicitous beetle.

26:48.375 --> 26:53.206
I have proved myself,
Finn, more than you have.

26:53.306 --> 26:56.626
I'm the one that put
Rebekah in another body,

26:56.726 --> 26:58.384
and whilst Klaus
is out there looking

26:58.385 --> 26:59.985
for his dear, little sister,

26:59.986 --> 27:01.387
I was forging a dagger that will

27:01.388 --> 27:03.388
put him to sleep for centuries.

27:03.389 --> 27:04.857
I don't want
to put him to sleep.

27:04.858 --> 27:05.991
I want him dead.

27:05.992 --> 27:10.996
Yes, but you're gonna need
allies, and I've got them.

27:10.997 --> 27:14.366
Davina Claire,
she's a harvest girl.

27:14.367 --> 27:16.735
I've got her wrapped
around my little finger.

27:16.736 --> 27:19.104
I have.

27:19.105 --> 27:21.406
With her on our side,
there is nothing,

27:21.407 --> 27:23.774
nothing that will
stand in our way.

27:26.078 --> 27:29.380
Cassie.

27:51.002 --> 27:53.224
[Creak]

28:10.989 --> 28:12.791
[Creak]

28:12.792 --> 28:14.454
Cassie, where
the hell have you...

28:14.554 --> 28:16.995
I'm sorry, Rebekah,

28:16.996 --> 28:19.297
but you didn't leave
me much choice.

28:19.298 --> 28:21.670
I told you, there's no escape.

28:21.770 --> 28:26.670
I had to turn to the only people
I knew I could trust...

28:27.739 --> 28:31.943
And I told them that they had
to deal with you.

28:31.944 --> 28:34.145
My only regret is that
I didn't stop you

28:34.146 --> 28:36.981
before you killed
one of our own,

28:36.982 --> 28:40.717
and now you have to be punished.

28:41.986 --> 28:45.235
No. I didn't kill her,
though, to be fair,

28:45.335 --> 28:48.191
I won't miss the ugly cow.

28:53.397 --> 28:55.165
Hrrgh...

28:57.201 --> 29:01.339
You're all so mean, like the mouse
that torments the cat

29:01.340 --> 29:04.442
in those cartoons.

29:04.443 --> 29:07.674
I think you're the ones
who need to be punished.

29:13.284 --> 29:16.320
The others were just
ignorant bullies,

29:16.321 --> 29:19.356
but you, you're a smart girl,

29:19.357 --> 29:23.815
powerful, and yet you
still betrayed a friend.

29:26.363 --> 29:28.532
Aah!

29:28.533 --> 29:31.567
Aah! Aah!

29:38.542 --> 29:40.874
I despise traitors.

29:43.680 --> 29:45.581
[Panting]

29:57.227 --> 30:00.463
How did you do that?

30:09.636 --> 30:11.446
Uh...

30:11.546 --> 30:14.374
I've drawn this out
for long enough,

30:14.375 --> 30:16.710
but you can hardly blame me.

30:16.711 --> 30:20.213
I find the sheer audacity
of your plot quite offensive.

30:20.214 --> 30:23.317
Hayley is part of my family now,

30:23.318 --> 30:26.286
and you would seek to use her
for your petty ambitions.

30:26.287 --> 30:28.422
I'm not using her.

30:28.423 --> 30:30.691
Just admit your true intentions

30:30.692 --> 30:34.677
for this farce of a wedding,
and I will end this quickly.

30:34.777 --> 30:38.565
I love Hayley,
and I will fight for her...

30:38.566 --> 30:40.734
Uh! Uh!...

30:40.735 --> 30:44.187
Till I'm dead.

30:45.496 --> 30:47.707
Ugh!

30:47.708 --> 30:49.776
Well, you've got
more fight in you

30:49.777 --> 30:51.877
than I'd have imagined...

30:53.504 --> 30:56.449
But I remain unimpressed.

30:56.450 --> 30:58.050
Mhh!

30:58.968 --> 31:04.591
You told me once that my people
were yours, too,

31:04.592 --> 31:10.797
and if you kill me
now, promise me

31:10.798 --> 31:16.935
that you will help Hayley
set our people free.

31:29.215 --> 31:33.319
I trust him, Klaus.
Do you hear me?

31:33.320 --> 31:36.389
You're not gonna kill him,

31:36.390 --> 31:40.091
not unless you want
to go through me.

31:42.136 --> 31:45.264
You truly believe
that he is worthy

31:45.265 --> 31:48.300
of your trust?
Yes.

31:52.405 --> 31:56.475
Oh, you are stubborn,
little wolf.

31:56.476 --> 31:58.777
Perhaps you two were
meant for each other.

32:08.421 --> 32:11.608
Go on, then.
Tell him.

32:13.418 --> 32:16.162
Have your wedding.

32:16.163 --> 32:21.834
Save your wolves,
but you mark my words.

32:21.835 --> 32:25.504
If you ever betray her,
I will find you,

32:25.505 --> 32:30.643
and I will deposit your head
on the end of a spike.

32:30.644 --> 32:33.630
Perhaps I'll leave it in
your grandmother's garden.

32:40.853 --> 32:42.887
Here.

32:45.450 --> 32:48.694
Klaus knows you trapped Rebekah,

32:48.695 --> 32:50.496
and yet he hasn't
tracked you down

32:50.497 --> 32:52.531
to torture her
location out of you?

32:52.532 --> 32:55.834
Well, I'm smart enough
not to be found.

32:55.835 --> 32:59.671
Ha ha ha! Ooh.

32:59.672 --> 33:02.341
And Elijah also knows
Rebekah is missing,

33:02.342 --> 33:04.476
and yet he remains
unaccounted for.

33:04.477 --> 33:06.511
Despite my power,
I've been unable

33:06.512 --> 33:10.349
to locate him, which suggests
he's gone to great lengths

33:10.350 --> 33:15.421
to hide himself, and Elijah
hides from no one...

33:17.422 --> 33:21.493
Unless he's keeping
something hidden.

33:21.494 --> 33:25.263
Wow, Finn, you sound
like Sherlock Holmes

33:25.264 --> 33:28.017
after one too many tequilas.

33:28.117 --> 33:32.771
And you act a fool to dare think
that I wouldn't know about

33:32.772 --> 33:34.905
your little friends in the back.

33:42.173 --> 33:44.248
Davina, I got him.

33:47.166 --> 33:51.008
Allow me to send a message
to your little girlfriend.

33:52.538 --> 33:53.706
[Gasps]

33:53.707 --> 33:56.408
Josh, it's me.
You all right?

33:56.409 --> 33:58.509
[Hisses]

34:04.683 --> 34:06.183
Come on.

34:11.422 --> 34:13.425
Hey, Josh, please...

34:13.426 --> 34:15.726
[Crack]

34:15.728 --> 34:17.900
Davina, let's go.

34:22.601 --> 34:25.504
You're her, the all-powerful
girl in the coffin...

34:25.505 --> 34:27.205
That's how you did magic...

34:27.206 --> 34:29.841
But why didn't you just tell me?

34:29.842 --> 34:33.478
I'd only just woken
from a century of sleep.

34:33.478 --> 34:37.581
I wanted to know you,
see what you were really like,

34:37.583 --> 34:41.518
and you didn't disappoint me.

34:41.520 --> 34:43.688
There's a spark
in your, Rebekah.

34:43.688 --> 34:46.725
You're willful, also kind.

34:46.726 --> 34:50.428
You're not half as bad
as our brothers.

34:50.429 --> 34:52.697
What did you say?

34:52.697 --> 34:54.532
You're right, you know.

34:54.533 --> 34:57.836
We met once before...
Christmas party in 1914.

34:57.837 --> 35:01.372
I was so desperate to catch
a glimpse of my family.

35:04.109 --> 35:08.743
Rebekah, you know who I am.

35:10.582 --> 35:13.484
You're the girl in my nightmare.

35:13.485 --> 35:15.208
It really is you...

35:19.390 --> 35:20.838
Freya.

35:29.801 --> 35:33.267
[Chanting]

35:38.309 --> 35:40.478
I slept 100 years,

35:40.479 --> 35:42.980
and now finally, I'm free.

35:42.981 --> 35:45.983
Tell our brothers I'll be
coming to see them soon,

35:45.984 --> 35:49.826
and I expect nothing less
than their best behavior.

36:08.417 --> 36:13.655
Finn: Now, are you through with this
little ruse, brother?

36:23.599 --> 36:25.367
Seems your little friend Davina

36:25.368 --> 36:26.869
has absconded with
one of my prisoners.

36:26.870 --> 36:28.937
I didn't come here for a fight.

36:28.938 --> 36:31.840
The little witch, she asked
me to be a distraction.

36:31.841 --> 36:35.878
She can be quite pushy when
she wants to be, you know?

36:35.879 --> 36:37.746
Don't you see?

36:37.747 --> 36:39.681
We were given a gift...

36:39.682 --> 36:43.685
Rebirth unfettered by vampirism.

36:43.686 --> 36:45.854
We were made clean,
and all that was asked

36:45.855 --> 36:50.826
was a pittance in return, and you
could not even give that.

36:50.827 --> 36:56.665
Finn, you're angry,
and when you're angry,

36:56.666 --> 36:59.534
you don't think straight.

36:59.535 --> 37:00.702
So just give me a chance.

37:00.703 --> 37:04.539
You don't deserve
another chance, Kol.

37:04.540 --> 37:08.009
So I'm gonna give you
the one thing

37:08.010 --> 37:13.715
I know you fear most... death.

37:13.716 --> 37:15.550
No. No!

37:15.551 --> 37:17.852
[Chanting]

37:17.853 --> 37:24.392
I curse you to this body,
unable to jump to another.

37:24.393 --> 37:26.861
Over the next few days,
I want you to contemplate

37:26.862 --> 37:31.499
what's to come...
A meaningless, lonely death

37:31.500 --> 37:33.967
and the darkness to follow.

37:35.937 --> 37:38.540
Clock starts now.

37:38.541 --> 37:41.609
Be sure to say your good-byes.

37:41.610 --> 37:45.947
Go, brother.
I will not miss you.

37:45.948 --> 37:48.402
[Music playing]

37:51.552 --> 37:55.757
Mary: There.
You let that sit.

37:55.758 --> 37:57.703
You'll feel better
in the morning.

37:59.994 --> 38:02.730
Mary, I am so sorry.

38:02.731 --> 38:08.469
For what, knowing a monster,
having baggage in your past?

38:08.470 --> 38:14.136
We all got that,
some worse than others.

38:16.110 --> 38:19.947
When Jack was down,
you fought for him.

38:19.948 --> 38:23.354
Lot of married folk
never get that far.

38:28.322 --> 38:32.760
You ok?
I'll live.

38:32.761 --> 38:34.628
That's the thing
I can't figure out.

38:34.629 --> 38:36.630
Why didn't he kill me?

38:36.631 --> 38:39.433
Klaus was afraid
of trusting anyone.

38:39.434 --> 38:43.104
I think he realized that not
trusting you would be worse.

38:43.105 --> 38:46.419
He'd end up surrounded
by enemies, alone.

38:56.350 --> 38:59.319
I want to tell you a story...

39:01.655 --> 39:04.395
About a beautiful baby girl...

39:06.627 --> 39:10.943
And the parents who swore
they would die to protect her.

39:20.374 --> 39:22.643
Klaus: The wedding
works in our favor.

39:22.644 --> 39:24.645
Newly empowered
and ruled by Hayley,

39:24.646 --> 39:26.780
the wolves will be
an asset to our family.

39:26.781 --> 39:27.814
Elijah: Yes, assuming
you're willing

39:27.815 --> 39:29.750
to trust Jackson
with our secrecy.

39:29.751 --> 39:30.984
Must confess, brother,

39:30.985 --> 39:32.786
I'm a little surprised
to find that you do.

39:32.787 --> 39:34.855
Well, faith in Jackson
is a means to an end.

39:34.856 --> 39:35.889
If I had simply killed him,

39:35.890 --> 39:37.691
Hayley would have
turned against me.

39:37.692 --> 39:39.793
You should have
seen the ferocity

39:39.794 --> 39:41.307
with which she defended him.

39:41.407 --> 39:43.663
It was impressive.

39:43.664 --> 39:46.833
That being said, I don't take
the matter of secrets lightly.

39:46.834 --> 39:48.568
Once the wedding takes place

39:48.569 --> 39:50.637
and the wolves
are forever altered,

39:50.638 --> 39:55.274
well, Jackson's fate becomes
a little less certain.

39:57.544 --> 39:59.045
[Dagger clatters]

39:59.046 --> 40:01.080
Rebekah: Hello, Nik.

40:08.388 --> 40:10.557
I don't suppose you imagined

40:10.558 --> 40:13.464
that always and forever
would lead us to this.

40:18.631 --> 40:20.700
Rebekah.

40:20.701 --> 40:25.726
You absolutely will not
believe the week I've had.

40:33.746 --> 40:36.716
Good. You're awake.

40:36.717 --> 40:40.620
I've just one more question.

40:40.621 --> 40:44.023
Ok. Let my guys go free,

40:44.024 --> 40:46.292
and I'll tell you whatever
it is you want to know.

40:46.293 --> 40:51.961
How selfless, but we've already
established that

40:52.061 --> 40:55.134
you don't know anything
of any consequence.

40:55.135 --> 40:58.104
However, it's a common belief

40:58.105 --> 40:59.805
among the werewolves
that you were,

40:59.806 --> 41:03.709
in fact, the last person
to see Niklaus' child alive.

41:03.710 --> 41:07.947
You were in possession
of the baby's corpse.

41:07.948 --> 41:14.108
So tell me, how, exactly,
did the baby die?

41:16.789 --> 41:20.259
You don't remember.

41:20.260 --> 41:25.598
You don't remember because you
were compelled to forget.

41:25.599 --> 41:28.300
Why would Niklaus
compel away the truth

41:28.301 --> 41:36.175
from the vampire he thinks
of as his adopted son, what...

41:36.176 --> 41:40.801
Besides a desire to protect
his own daughter?

41:43.983 --> 41:48.100
She's still alive...

41:49.288 --> 41:57.662
And now you and your vampires
are gonna help me find her.
