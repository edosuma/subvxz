<b>Understand?</b>

02:17.300 --> 02:18.490

<b>Aren't we there yet?</b>

02:51.920 --> 02:53.300
<b>We still have a while to go.</b>

02:54.470 --> 02:56.780
<b>How much walking do we have to do...</b>

02:59.720 --> 03:02.850
<b>Honestly, I cannot believe this!</b>

03:02.850 --> 03:05.000
<b>Kil was finally home!</b>

03:05.000 --> 03:07.630
<b>But the men allowed him to leave again!</b>

03:07.630 --> 03:09.110
<b>And Father is just as guilty!</b>

03:09.110 --> 03:11.920
<b>He released Kil without permission!</b>

03:11.920 --> 03:12.920
<b>Really,</b>

03:12.920 --> 03:15.150
<b>this always happens!</b>

03:15.150 --> 03:18.430
<b>They never ask me before they act.</b>

03:18.430 --> 03:19.750
<b>Do you understand, Gotoh?</b>

03:20.390 --> 03:21.250
<b>Yes, ma'am.</b>

03:25.960 --> 03:30.060
<b>Th-This is a most critical time for Kil...</b>

03:30.670 --> 03:33.150
<b>Why don't they understand?</b>

<b>He's the one child I shall not give up!</b>

03:49.910 --> 03:50.940
<b>There it is.</b>

<b>That building?</b>

03:55.760 --> 03:58.270
<b>But it's still pretty far away.</b>

03:58.270 --> 03:59.980
<b>Say, Canary.</b>

03:59.980 --> 04:03.550
<b>Won't you get in trouble

04:04.150 --> 04:08.720
<b>They already know what I'm doing.</b>

04:09.340 --> 04:11.210
<b>So I am prepared to take the consequences.</b>

04:11.210 --> 04:14.100
<b>If there's any trouble, I'll take responsibility.</b>

04:15.870 --> 04:16.840
<b>No.</b>

04:16.840 --> 04:20.610
<b>I'm merely serving as a guide

<b>Killua-sama, we've been waiting for you.</b>

04:36.000 --> 04:38.750
<b>Gotoh, where's Gon now?</b>

04:39.250 --> 04:40.520
<b>You do know, right?</b>

04:41.070 --> 04:44.760
<b>Canary is bringing Gon-sama here,</b>

04:44.760 --> 04:46.550
<b>along with his two friends.</b>

04:47.280 --> 04:48.260
<b>Really?</b>

04:48.560 --> 04:52.020
<b>They should arrive shortly,

04:52.020 --> 04:53.140
<b>Okay.</b>

04:57.140 --> 04:58.150
<b>Gotoh.</b>

04:58.150 --> 04:58.900
<b>Yes, sir.</b>

04:58.900 --> 05:01.390
<b>Let me know the second Gon gets here.</b>

05:01.390 --> 05:02.540
<b>Yes, sir.</b>

05:02.540 --> 05:04.290
<b>I shall notify you immediately.</b>

05:12.780 --> 05:16.420
<b><i>Forgive me, Killua-sama.</i></b>

05:21.670 --> 05:23.920
<b>Hey, we finally made it.</b>

05:32.560 --> 05:34.050
<b>Welcome.</b>

05:37.390 --> 05:40.440
<b>Please forgive the rude reception.</b>

05:41.200 --> 05:45.820
<b>The lady of the house has 
asked us to treat you</b>

05:45.820 --> 05:48.290
<b>as official guests.</b>

05:49.480 --> 05:51.480
<b>Is that better?</b>

05:51.480 --> 05:52.950
<b>Thanks.</b>

05:58.540 --> 06:00.800
<b>Then this is not the primary residence?</b>

06:00.800 --> 06:03.210
<b>No, this place is for the butlers.</b>

06:03.530 --> 06:06.470
<b>Well, please make yourselves at home.</b>

06:06.880 --> 06:09.040
<b>I appreciate the hospitality,</b>

06:09.040 --> 06:11.350
<b>but we've come to see Killua.</b>

06:11.930 --> 06:15.190
<b>Can you take us to him at once?</b>

06:15.840 --> 06:17.730
<b>That won't be necessary.</b>

06:19.440 --> 06:22.730
<b>Killua-sama is on his way here.</b>

06:22.730 --> 06:24.030
<b>Really?</b>

06:24.030 --> 06:26.860
<b>Yes, so please wait a little longer.</b>

06:27.290 --> 06:28.560
<b>That's great news, Gon!</b>

06:28.560 --> 06:29.470
<b>Yeah!</b>

06:30.060 --> 06:31.120
<b>Now, then...</b>

06:31.740 --> 06:34.620
<b>To simply sit and wait would be dull.</b>

06:35.520 --> 06:38.500
<b>How about a game, to pass the time?</b>

06:39.380 --> 06:41.000
<b>A game?</b>

06:50.650 --> 06:52.390
<b>Which hand holds the coin?</b>

06:53.610 --> 06:54.640
<b>The left hand.</b>

06:56.090 --> 06:57.900
<b>Correct.</b>

06:57.900 --> 07:01.000
<b>So I'll move more quickly this time.</b>

07:06.240 --> 07:07.570
<b>Well? Which hand?</b>

07:08.980 --> 07:10.320
<b>Left again.</b>

07:10.670 --> 07:12.060
<b>Marvelous.</b>

07:12.770 --> 07:15.840
<b>Then I shall try harder this time.</b>

07:22.330 --> 07:23.960
<b>Well? Which hand?</b>

07:25.550 --> 07:28.440
<b>I'm not positive, but I'd guess the right.</b>

07:28.440 --> 07:29.210
<b>You see...</b>

07:30.240 --> 07:32.730
<b>I have known Killua-sama his entire life.</b>

07:33.340 --> 07:36.720
<b>I dare say that I care for him 
as though he were my own.</b>

07:37.310 --> 07:38.720
<b>In all honesty,</b>

07:39.330 --> 07:42.600
<b>I must despise you for trying 
to take him away.</b>

07:46.070 --> 07:47.610
<b>Well? Which hand?</b>

07:48.140 --> 07:49.610
<b>Answer.</b>

07:50.340 --> 07:51.610
<b>The left hand.</b>

07:57.990 --> 08:01.110
<b>His lady mother could barely speak...</b>

08:01.870 --> 08:04.880
<b>She must be heartbroken, 
having to watch him leave.</b>

08:06.560 --> 08:07.880
<b>I cannot forgive it.</b>

08:09.550 --> 08:12.630
<b>By the time Killua-sama arrives, 
a decision will be reached.</b>

08:13.010 --> 08:15.880
<b>I shall test you in my own way.</b>

08:16.470 --> 08:18.010
<b>You have no choice.</b>

08:23.390 --> 08:24.540
<b>Canary!</b>

08:25.450 --> 08:29.230
<b>This is her punishment for having 
brought you here, against her orders.</b>

08:30.130 --> 08:31.730
<b>I shall explain the rules.</b>

08:31.730 --> 08:34.790
<b>If one of you answers incorrectly, 
that person is out of the games.</b>

08:35.530 --> 08:37.370
<b>Should you all be disqualified,</b>

08:37.940 --> 08:41.940
<b>I shall tell Killua-sama that you left.</b>

08:42.380 --> 08:45.250
<b>And that he will never see you again.</b>

08:45.550 --> 08:46.230
<b>Killua is...</b>

08:46.230 --> 08:47.500
<b>Silence!</b>

08:47.940 --> 08:51.290
<b>Your lives hang by a thread.</b>

08:51.850 --> 08:54.730
<b>Now, answer my question.</b>

09:02.300 --> 09:03.640
<b>Which hand?</b>

09:07.330 --> 09:08.400
<b><i>I couldn't see it...</i></b>

09:08.950 --> 09:10.920
<b>Don't take too long.</b>

09:10.920 --> 09:12.780
<b>You have three seconds to answer.</b>

09:13.410 --> 09:14.300
<b>Hey...</b>

09:14.300 --> 09:16.880
<b>After three seconds have passed, 
slit her throat.</b>

09:16.880 --> 09:17.660
<b>Okay.</b>

09:17.970 --> 09:19.670
<b>Wait! Left hand!</b>

09:19.670 --> 09:20.900
<b>I pick the right hand!</b>

09:20.900 --> 09:21.960
<b>Me, too!</b>

09:26.190 --> 09:28.880
<b>One disqualified.</b>

09:36.300 --> 09:37.300
<b><i>This is futile.</i></b>

09:37.300 --> 09:38.760
<b><i>I can't see anything!</i></b>

09:41.250 --> 09:42.140
<b>Which hand?</b>

09:45.120 --> 09:46.640
<b>I choose the right hand.</b>

09:46.640 --> 09:47.900
<b>I pick the left.</b>

09:49.630 --> 09:51.630
<b>It was in my left hand.</b>

09:51.630 --> 09:53.400
<b>Only one remains now.</b>

09:59.450 --> 10:00.350
<b>Here I go.</b>

10:00.350 --> 10:01.370
<b>One second!</b>

10:03.160 --> 10:04.110
<b>What is it?</b>

10:04.580 --> 10:07.210
<b>If you're trying to buy time, 
I'll kill one of your friends.</b>

10:07.710 --> 10:09.540
<b>Leorio, lend me your knife.</b>

10:09.540 --> 10:10.210
<b>Huh?</b>

10:10.210 --> 10:11.780
<b>Don't worry.</b>

10:11.780 --> 10:13.890
<b>I won't use it for anything stupid.</b>

10:21.720 --> 10:22.880
<b><i>That's it...</i></b>

10:22.880 --> 10:24.520
<b><i>He's bleeding himself, to reduce the swelling.</i></b>

10:28.530 --> 10:31.230
<b>Man, how long do I have to wait?</b>

10:32.030 --> 10:33.480
<b>Hey, Gotoh!</b>

10:35.490 --> 10:37.240
<b>Anyone around?</b>

10:40.540 --> 10:41.980
<b>What's going on?</b>

10:44.170 --> 10:45.610
<b>Okay!</b>

10:45.610 --> 10:46.830
<b>Now I can see.</b>

10:46.830 --> 10:48.000
<b>Give me your best!</b>

10:53.820 --> 10:54.460
<b>Which hand?</b>

10:55.210 --> 10:56.090
<b>Left hand.</b>

10:56.730 --> 10:57.950
<b>Not bad.</b>

10:57.950 --> 10:58.910
<b>In that case...</b>

11:08.800 --> 11:11.060
<b>Who now holds the coin?</b>

11:14.060 --> 11:24.160
<b>Hunter Vocabulary</b>

11:20.110 --> 11:24.160
<b>Waiting Time</b>

11:37.820 --> 11:40.290
<b>The person right behind me.</b>

11:46.710 --> 11:48.110
<b>Brilliant.</b>

11:49.920 --> 11:52.030
<b>Gotoh, is Gon here yet?</b>

11:52.030 --> 11:52.700
<b>Killua!</b>

11:52.700 --> 11:54.920
<b>Oh! You're here, Gon!</b>

11:54.920 --> 11:56.500
<b>Along with...</b>

11:56.500 --> 11:57.420
<b>Kurapika?</b>

11:57.420 --> 11:58.940
<b>I'm just an afterthought?</b>

11:58.940 --> 12:00.050
<b>Liorio!</b>

12:00.050 --> 12:01.530
<b>Leorio!</b>

12:02.220 --> 12:03.550
<b>It's been a while.</b>

12:03.550 --> 12:05.830
<b>I can't believe you came. 
What happened?</b>

12:05.830 --> 12:07.080
<b>Your face is a wreck!</b>

12:08.070 --> 12:09.200
<b>Yours isn't any better!</b>

12:12.350 --> 12:13.690
<b>Hey, Gotoh.</b>

12:13.690 --> 12:16.500
<b>I told you to let me know 
as soon as they arrived.</b>

12:16.500 --> 12:17.850
<b>What were you doing?</b>

12:18.320 --> 12:19.700
<b>Forgive me.</b>

12:20.220 --> 12:22.720
<b>I had them participate in a little game.</b>

12:23.110 --> 12:24.230
<b>A game?</b>

12:26.250 --> 12:29.290
<b>It was nothing more than a poor joke.</b>

12:30.070 --> 12:31.600
<b>I apologize for any aggravation.</b>

12:32.490 --> 12:34.800
<b>Did you enjoy yourselves?</b>

12:34.800 --> 12:37.720
<b>That was really good acting...</b>

12:37.720 --> 12:39.110
<b>What? Did they try something?</b>

12:39.110 --> 12:42.490
<b>No, they were entertaining us.</b>

12:42.490 --> 12:43.640
<b>Really?</b>

12:43.640 --> 12:44.850
<b>Well, whatever.</b>

12:44.850 --> 12:48.010
<b>Anyway, let's go somewhere else. 
Anywhere else, right now.</b>

12:48.010 --> 12:50.910
<b>If we stay here, my mother 
will give us an earful!</b>

12:50.910 --> 12:51.620
<b>Yeah!</b>

12:53.700 --> 12:54.830
<b>Hey, Gotoh.</b>

12:54.830 --> 12:55.800
<b>Listen up.</b>

12:55.800 --> 12:58.630
<b>I don't care what Mother says. 
Don't follow me.</b>

12:59.190 --> 13:02.380
<b>Understood. Please take care.</b>

13:02.380 --> 13:03.950
<b>Gon, let's go.</b>

13:04.360 --> 13:05.590
<b>Bye.</b>

13:12.010 --> 13:13.100
<b>Gotoh-san.</b>

13:13.780 --> 13:16.680
<b>Once Killua leaves, you'll be lonely, huh?</b>

13:17.720 --> 13:19.110
<b>No.</b>

13:19.110 --> 13:21.900
<b>We butlers feel no emotional attachment</b>

13:21.900 --> 13:24.610
<b>to our employers.</b>

13:25.570 --> 13:26.730
<b>You're lying.</b>

13:28.960 --> 13:30.120
<b>Gon-kun...</b>

13:36.890 --> 13:38.500
<b>Well? Which hand?</b>

13:39.070 --> 13:40.380
<b>Isn't it your left hand?</b>

13:41.880 --> 13:43.870
<b>What? No way!</b>

13:43.870 --> 13:45.630
<b>Indeed. It was a deception.</b>

13:46.690 --> 13:49.640
<b>In this world, there are many 
things that are wrong.</b>

13:52.490 --> 13:53.640
<b>Please be careful.</b>

13:54.650 --> 13:57.900
<b>I am entrusting Killua-sama to you.</b>

14:04.000 --> 14:05.150
<b>Bye, Canary!</b>

14:07.040 --> 14:08.530
<b>Took you long enough, Gon!</b>

14:08.530 --> 14:09.850
<b>Sorry about that.</b>

14:09.850 --> 14:12.800
<b>Let's make ourselves scarce 
before more trouble comes.</b>

14:16.150 --> 14:18.920
<b>Yeah, he's used that trick on me before.</b>

14:19.490 --> 14:22.590
<b>Once you know the secret, 
it's so simple, it'll make you mad.</b>

14:22.590 --> 14:24.380
<b>Huh? Really?</b>

14:25.500 --> 14:27.840
<b>I'm assuming this was what he did.</b>

14:30.150 --> 14:31.390
<b>Which hand?</b>

14:31.390 --> 14:32.430
<b>It's your left hand, right?</b>

14:33.680 --> 14:35.390
<b>Huh? How?</b>

14:35.390 --> 14:36.930
<b>Hey, how did you do that?</b>

14:37.360 --> 14:40.060
<b>Gotoh held two coins.</b>

14:40.060 --> 14:42.390
<b>Huh? But he only had the one.</b>

14:42.390 --> 14:45.520
<b>Anyway, he hid a coin in his right hand,</b>

14:45.520 --> 14:46.820
<b>while flipping the other.</b>

14:48.410 --> 14:52.680
<b>And then he let us see him grab 
the coin using his left hand.</b>

14:52.680 --> 14:56.300
<b>But before he asked us 
which hand held the coin,</b>

14:56.300 --> 14:59.000
<b>he raised both arms,</b>

14:59.480 --> 15:04.500
<b>and he slipped the first coin into his sleeve.</b>

15:06.170 --> 15:09.110
<b>That left the coin in his right hand.</b>

15:09.110 --> 15:10.170
<b>You got it.</b>

15:10.910 --> 15:12.140
<b>That really makes me mad.</b>

15:12.540 --> 15:16.540
<b>Well, I'm fairly certain he only used 
the trick on the final turn.</b>

15:16.540 --> 15:20.260
<b>Gotoh hates cheating, even if it's just a game.</b>

15:20.260 --> 15:22.100
<b>That's even worse!</b>

15:29.310 --> 15:29.900
<b>What?</b>

15:29.900 --> 15:32.800
<b>You're here on a tourist visa?</b>

15:32.800 --> 15:33.530
<b>Uh-huh.</b>

15:33.910 --> 15:35.980
<b>Didn't you pass the Hunter Exam?</b>

15:35.980 --> 15:38.230
<b>You could've just used your Hunter License.</b>

15:38.230 --> 15:42.120
<b>It lets you stay in other countries 
for as long as you want.</b>

15:42.120 --> 15:43.670
<b>That's what we said.</b>

15:44.190 --> 15:46.080
<b>I already decided.</b>

15:46.080 --> 15:48.170
<b>I'm not using the license until I've 
finished what I need to do.</b>

15:48.520 --> 15:50.870
<b>What do you have to do?</b>

15:52.760 --> 15:53.680
<b>The tag</b>

15:54.020 --> 15:57.310
<b>that Hisoka gave me!</b>

16:02.680 --> 16:04.170
<b><i>I'll only take it back</i></b>

16:04.170 --> 16:07.940
<b><i>when you're able to punch me 
in the face, just like that.</i></b>

16:08.920 --> 16:13.450
<b><i>Until then, I shall leave the tag with you.</i></b>

16:14.140 --> 16:18.450
<b>I'll return it to Hisoka when 
I punch him in the face!</b>

16:18.750 --> 16:22.320
<b>Until I do that, I won't use my Hunter License.</b>

16:22.320 --> 16:24.280
<b>I can't go back to Whale Island, either.</b>

16:24.280 --> 16:25.470
<b>Hmm...</b>

16:25.470 --> 16:27.230
<b>So, where's Hisoka?</b>

16:27.980 --> 16:29.540
<b>Uh...</b>

16:29.540 --> 16:31.420
<b>Thought so...</b>

16:31.420 --> 16:33.720
<b>I know where he is, Gon.</b>

16:33.720 --> 16:35.340
<b>Huh? Really?</b>

16:35.850 --> 16:37.130
<b>How?</b>

16:37.130 --> 16:38.850
<b>He told me.</b>

16:39.960 --> 16:41.230
<b>So that's what he said...</b>

16:44.570 --> 16:46.980
<b>No, this was after the orientation.</b>

16:46.980 --> 16:49.260
<b>But it's still related, right?</b>

16:49.260 --> 16:50.480
<b>I suppose so.</b>

16:51.030 --> 16:53.420
<b>I've been itching to ask...</b>

16:53.420 --> 16:55.860
<b>What did Hisoka say to you?</b>

16:57.790 --> 16:59.370
<b>He told me...</b>

17:00.210 --> 17:03.540
<b><i>I have some information for you 
regarding the spider.</i></b>

17:04.320 --> 17:06.170
<b>The Phantom Troupe?</b>

17:06.170 --> 17:09.580
<b>I do not recall mentioning the 
Phantom Troupe to Hisoka.</b>

17:09.580 --> 17:13.100
<b>So either he overheard our conversation 
during the first stage,</b>

17:13.100 --> 17:14.680
<b>or he heard of it from another.</b>

17:15.330 --> 17:17.070
<b>The spider is the Phantom Troupe's symbol,</b>

17:17.070 --> 17:20.560
<b>so those familiar with the organization 
refer to the Troupe as such.</b>

17:21.610 --> 17:24.560
<b>I was interested in his information.</b>

17:24.860 --> 17:26.520
<b>I see...</b>

17:26.770 --> 17:29.030
<b><i>So that's why you swallowed your pride</i></b>

17:29.030 --> 17:32.570
<b><i>and accepted Hisoka's surrender.</i></b>

17:33.230 --> 17:36.070
<b>After the orientation, I asked him about it.</b>

17:36.950 --> 17:40.620
<b><i>I shall await you in Yorknew City, 
on September 1st.</i></b>

17:41.250 --> 17:43.000
<b>September 1st?</b>

17:43.000 --> 17:46.590
<b>Then you've still got over half a year.</b>

17:46.590 --> 17:49.230
<b>What's going to happen in Yorknew City?</b>

17:50.130 --> 17:52.250
<b>They'll hold the world's largest auction.</b>

17:52.660 --> 17:53.710
<b>Correct.</b>

17:53.710 --> 17:56.390
<b>From September 1st through September 10th,</b>

17:56.390 --> 17:57.740
<b>there will be an auction</b>

17:57.740 --> 17:59.600
<b>for unusual items, rare goods,</b>

17:59.600 --> 18:02.760
<b>and national treasures from around the world.</b>

18:02.760 --> 18:06.090
<b>The event attracts all manner of nasty folk</b>

18:06.090 --> 18:08.730
<b>who come looking to satisfy their greed.</b>

18:08.730 --> 18:11.520
<b>It's the biggest gathering of money in the world.</b>

18:13.030 --> 18:15.570
<b>So the Troupe will be there?</b>

18:15.570 --> 18:17.490
<b>They're a group of bandits.</b>

18:17.490 --> 18:20.530
<b>They would not let this chance escape.</b>

18:21.080 --> 18:25.540
<b>So on that day, Hisoka will be 
somewhere in Yorknew City.</b>

18:25.540 --> 18:28.440
<b>Okay. September 1st.</b>

18:28.440 --> 18:30.540
<b>Got it. Thanks.</b>

18:37.580 --> 18:39.900
<b>Then I shall depart now.</b>

18:39.900 --> 18:40.550
<b>Huh?</b>

18:40.940 --> 18:44.720
<b>We managed to see Killua again, 
so I'm finished here.</b>

18:45.240 --> 18:48.440
<b>I'll need money to participate in the auction.</b>

18:49.040 --> 18:52.940
<b>So I shall search for a patron 
to employ me as a Hunter.</b>

18:52.940 --> 18:54.320
<b>Really...</b>

18:54.800 --> 18:57.790
<b>I guess I should go home, then.</b>

18:57.790 --> 18:58.820
<b>You, too?</b>

18:59.280 --> 19:01.940
<b>I haven't given up my dream 
of becoming a doctor.</b>

19:01.940 --> 19:03.660
<b>If I'm accepted to medical school,</b>

19:03.660 --> 19:06.700
<b>I can use this to pay the ridiculous fee.</b>

19:07.270 --> 19:10.000
<b>I'll have to go back and start cramming.</b>

19:10.000 --> 19:12.010
<b>Uh-huh, good luck.</b>

19:16.050 --> 19:17.370
<b>Until we meet again.</b>

19:17.370 --> 19:19.340
<b>Yes, that will be...</b>

19:19.990 --> 19:23.350
<b>September 1st, in Yorknew City.</b>

19:23.720 --> 19:24.700
<b>See ya.</b>

19:29.070 --> 19:31.350
<b>Bye-bye!</b>

19:32.580 --> 19:34.880
<b>It's just the two of us now.</b>

19:34.880 --> 19:36.680
<b>Hey, what do you want to do?</b>

19:36.680 --> 19:39.490
<b>You have to ask? We train, obviously.</b>

19:39.790 --> 19:41.350
<b>Huh? Train for what?</b>

19:41.350 --> 19:42.550
<b>Shouldn't we have some fun?</b>

19:44.140 --> 19:47.000
<b>Do you remember what you just said?</b>

19:47.000 --> 19:50.500
<b>Think you can punch Hisoka in 
the face without training?</b>

19:50.980 --> 19:52.500
<b>You couldn't land a punch</b>

19:52.500 --> 19:54.600
<b>in ten years, let alone six months!</b>

19:55.970 --> 19:56.900
<b>Okay.</b>

19:57.510 --> 19:59.930
<b>Here, I'll make it easy to understand.</b>

19:59.930 --> 20:02.300
<b>This is Hisoka. This is Hanzo.</b>

20:02.300 --> 20:03.260
<b>Uh-huh...</b>

20:03.740 --> 20:07.820
<b>If this is the gap between Hisoka 
and Hanzo, in terms of strength,</b>

20:07.820 --> 20:09.420
<b>the gap between Hisoka and you</b>

20:17.270 --> 20:18.640
<b>is this far!</b>

20:18.640 --> 20:20.330
<b>And I'm being generous.</b>

20:21.040 --> 20:22.400
<b><i>Now I'm mad...</i></b>

20:23.510 --> 20:25.730
<b>Then where are you?</b>

20:25.730 --> 20:26.800
<b>Me?</b>

20:28.820 --> 20:31.090
<b>Well, probably around here.</b>

20:31.090 --> 20:33.720
<b><i>Yep... I'm so humble.</i></b>

20:33.720 --> 20:36.420
<b>Oh, Hanzo is stronger?</b>

20:37.750 --> 20:38.850
<b>What is it?</b>

20:39.360 --> 20:41.700
<b>You really are amazing!</b>

20:41.700 --> 20:44.050
<b>Cut that out... It's embarrassing.</b>

20:44.050 --> 20:47.210
<b>I don't know how to tell the 
difference in strength</b>

20:47.210 --> 20:48.730
<b>between my opponent and myself.</b>

20:48.730 --> 20:51.010
<b>Stupid. It doesn't matter.</b>

20:51.010 --> 20:52.810
<b>I'm only estimating.</b>

20:52.940 --> 20:55.810
<b>You probably have a general idea.</b>

20:56.330 --> 20:57.680
<b>Once you have enough experience,</b>

20:57.680 --> 21:00.120
<b>your guess will become more accurate.</b>

21:00.120 --> 21:01.800
<b>Besides, the stronger someone is,</b>

21:01.800 --> 21:03.960
<b>the better they are at hiding that strength.</b>

21:03.960 --> 21:05.780
<b>So you shouldn't rely on this method.</b>

21:06.370 --> 21:07.320
<b>Oh...</b>

21:07.780 --> 21:10.500
<b>Well, in any case, Hisoka is strong.</b>

21:10.500 --> 21:11.200
<b>Yeah.</b>

21:12.020 --> 21:15.580
<b>You won't land a blow on him in six 
months through normal means.</b>

21:16.810 --> 21:18.790
<b>Gon, do you have any money?</b>

21:21.020 --> 21:22.850
<b>Actually, I'm running out.</b>

21:22.850 --> 21:24.510
<b>I don't have much, either.</b>

21:25.150 --> 21:29.470
<b>But there's somewhere we can train and 
earn money at the same time.</b>

21:30.100 --> 21:32.350
<b>Train and earn money?</b>

21:34.260 --> 21:36.100
<b>The Heavens Arena.</b>

21:36.100 --> 21:38.560
<b>Heavens Arena...</b>

21:38.560 --> 21:41.060
<b>Yeah, I'll explain later.</b>

21:41.060 --> 21:42.780
<b>We should get moving.</b>

21:43.100 --> 21:44.050
<b>Okay!</b>

21:47.990 --> 21:50.730
<b>After bidding farewell to Kurapika and Leorio,</b>

21:50.730 --> 21:55.430
<b>with promises to meet again in Yorknew City,</b>

21:55.430 --> 21:59.500
<b>Gon and Killua now head to a new stage, 
the Heavens Arena.</b>

23:27.350 --> 23:29.830
<b>Next time: Then x And x After!</b>

23:29.830 --> 23:30.820
<b>I like sweet and spicy.</b>

23:30.820 --> 23:32.400
<b>I like salty and spicy.</b>

23:32.400 --> 23:34.570
<b>Spicy is good for you!</b>
