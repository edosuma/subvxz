00:00.477 --> 00:02.125
<i>Previously on</i> Stargate Atlantis.

00:02.245 --> 00:03.895
<i>I give you the</i>

00:04.014 --> 00:07.052
<i>McKay-Carter
Intergalactic Gate Bridge.</i>

00:07.726 --> 00:11.115
34 Gates from both the Milky Way
and Pegasus Gate systems

00:11.235 --> 00:14.726
have been strategically placed in the
massive void between our two galaxies.

00:14.886 --> 00:18.188
<i>A macro that I have written
specially for the occasion</i>

00:18.348 --> 00:20.696
will command each Gate in the chain

00:20.816 --> 00:23.360
to store you in its buffer
and forward you along to the next...

00:23.520 --> 00:25.005
<i>and the next and the next...</i>

00:25.125 --> 00:27.031
<i>until you arrive here.</i>

00:27.583 --> 00:29.325
<i>Once at the Midway Space Station,</i>

00:29.445 --> 00:31.917
<i>you simply exit
the Pegasus Gate system</i>

00:32.156 --> 00:34.076
<i>and enter the Milky Way
Gate system, where</i>

00:34.196 --> 00:36.576
<i>a similar macro
designed by yours truly</i>

00:36.696 --> 00:38.615
<i>will forward you along to the SGC.</i>

00:38.735 --> 00:40.356
<i>The program is completely secure.</i>

00:40.476 --> 00:42.379
<i>No need for a shield or an iris.</i>

00:42.615 --> 00:45.605
Total travel time...
a little over 30 minutes.

00:45.855 --> 00:47.102
You applause.

00:50.204 --> 00:51.638
<i>Welcome back, Teyla.</i>

00:51.798 --> 00:54.094
<i>Thank you.
Believe me, it's good to be back.</i>

00:54.214 --> 00:56.425
<i>So, what's new on Earth?</i>

00:56.545 --> 00:57.847
<i>I wouldn't know.</i>

00:58.015 --> 01:01.272
<i>I saw nothing beyond the walls
of Stargate Command for two days.</i>

01:01.432 --> 01:04.866
- How'd the interview go?
- Exactly as you said it would.

01:04.986 --> 01:07.626
The new member of the IOA,
Mr. Coolidge,

01:07.746 --> 01:11.745
was somewhat brusque and arrogant.

01:12.324 --> 01:14.994
He insisted on doing
most of the questioning himself.

01:15.154 --> 01:17.956
I thought he would. These interviews
were the first item on his agenda.

01:18.555 --> 01:20.875
Don't worry, just a new guy
marking his territory.

01:20.995 --> 01:24.135
Yes, well, he is clearly
distrustful of aliens

01:24.375 --> 01:25.964
participating in any aspect

01:26.124 --> 01:27.486
of the Sargate Program,

01:27.606 --> 01:29.235
let alone being active team members.

01:29.355 --> 01:31.256
You changed his mind, right?

01:31.376 --> 01:32.220
I hope so.

01:32.924 --> 01:35.120
Although he did seem distracted

01:35.240 --> 01:37.142
- by my current condition.
<i>- Really?</i>

01:37.385 --> 01:40.666
- I informed the IOA of your pregnancy.
<i>- Yes, they knew,</i>

01:40.786 --> 01:44.786
and most of the members were actually
quite supportive. But Mr. Coolidge...

01:45.026 --> 01:47.216
His demeanor toward women differs

01:47.336 --> 01:49.054
from his demeanor toward men.

01:49.174 --> 01:51.406
He kept calling me "Honey".

01:53.085 --> 01:55.243
I admit, the urge to inflict harm

01:55.403 --> 01:58.016
on this man was quite strong, but

01:58.215 --> 02:01.067
- I managed to refrain from doing so.
- Good call.

02:01.187 --> 02:04.753
Bad idea to run around beating the crap
out of people with a baby on the way.

02:05.465 --> 02:08.006
In the end, I don't think
he will have a problem with me,

02:08.485 --> 02:10.717
mainly because I think
he believes I will not be

02:10.877 --> 02:13.086
returning to active duty
after my child is born.

02:13.206 --> 02:14.554
Won't he be surprised?

02:17.175 --> 02:19.434
Well, we'll cross that bridge
when we come to it.

02:19.594 --> 02:22.103
<i>In the meantime, it's important
that we get through these interviews</i>

02:22.263 --> 02:24.350
as smoothly as possible
and not create any waves.

02:24.470 --> 02:26.275
I'll inform you
when the report comes in.

02:26.395 --> 02:27.493
Thank you.

02:34.215 --> 02:35.916
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

02:36.036 --> 02:39.325
- Ronon's up next.
- Big waves. We're talking tsunamis.

02:39.445 --> 02:40.756
I've thought about that.

02:40.876 --> 02:42.436
His interview's not for three days,

02:42.556 --> 02:45.174
so I've asked somebody
to come to Atlantis and...

02:45.294 --> 02:46.294
"coach" him.

02:47.485 --> 02:48.292
Who?

02:56.437 --> 02:57.441
Teal'c.

02:58.826 --> 03:00.130
Colonel Carter.

03:00.835 --> 03:02.340
Welcome to Atlantis.

<i>So, Teal'c, the... hair...</i>

04:13.355 --> 04:15.296
- You do not like it?
- No, I love it.

04:15.416 --> 04:17.125
It's very... Earth.

04:19.687 --> 04:22.055
This city is much larger
than I had expected.

04:22.175 --> 04:23.915
It's a remarkable feat of engineering.

04:24.035 --> 04:26.044
The Ancients really knew
what they were doing.

04:26.164 --> 04:27.265
Indeed.

04:29.476 --> 04:31.274
You look well, Colonel Carter.

04:31.394 --> 04:33.926
- Command has been good to you.
- Thanks, Teal'c.

04:34.046 --> 04:35.595
It takes some getting used to.

04:35.715 --> 04:39.217
The military protocol's
pretty relaxed, but I like it here.

04:51.675 --> 04:52.776
Is that him?

04:54.115 --> 04:55.735
Yep. That's him.

04:57.017 --> 04:58.118
Come on.

05:00.844 --> 05:03.636
Ronon Dex, I'd like you
to meet Teal'c of the Jaffa.

05:03.756 --> 05:05.995
He's the one I was telling you about.

05:06.115 --> 05:08.738
It is a pleasure to meet you,
Ronon Dex.

05:09.126 --> 05:11.730
Colonel Carter has
spoken highly of you.

05:16.166 --> 05:17.267
Anyway...

05:17.816 --> 05:20.456
Like I said, you two are similar
in many ways,

05:20.576 --> 05:22.875
so you should have a lot in common.

05:24.005 --> 05:26.025
Teal'c was a member
of SG-1 for over 10 years.

05:26.145 --> 05:28.122
He knows all about
dealing with the IOA.

05:28.786 --> 05:30.375
<i>Which is why I thought</i>

05:30.795 --> 05:33.878
he could pass along a few pointers,
help you prep for the big interview.

05:38.146 --> 05:39.175
Colonel Carter?

05:40.405 --> 05:41.386
Yeah?

05:41.546 --> 05:44.347
Perhaps you could leave us
to become better acquainted.

05:44.996 --> 05:45.896
Sure.

05:48.645 --> 05:49.745
Have fun.

05:57.145 --> 05:59.247
Do you not speak, Ronon Dex?

06:01.326 --> 06:03.530
Not when I've got nothing to say.

06:21.994 --> 06:23.076
This is it.

06:23.196 --> 06:24.262
Get to work.

06:46.625 --> 06:47.924
May I join you?

06:52.231 --> 06:53.726
Salisbury steak.

06:54.413 --> 06:57.217
We are often served this
in the SGC mess hall.

06:58.281 --> 07:01.699
I must confess, however,
that I am partial to the tater tots...

07:03.195 --> 07:05.595
I don't need a coach teaching me
how to act during the interview.

07:06.108 --> 07:07.939
I've dealt with the IOA before.

07:09.429 --> 07:12.496
The IOA is comprised
of more than just Mr. Woolsey.

07:13.587 --> 07:16.481
Their new member, Mr. Coolidge,
is far less pleasant.

07:16.895 --> 07:18.827
Oh, well, I can handle him.

07:19.393 --> 07:20.526
I'll stay calm,

07:21.006 --> 07:22.769
answer all his questions.

07:24.163 --> 07:25.858
I know how to play the game.

07:26.763 --> 07:28.567
<i>I am pleased to hear that.</i>

07:30.276 --> 07:31.233
Very well.

07:31.807 --> 07:33.682
Let us speak of other things.

07:34.700 --> 07:35.561
Such as?

07:36.244 --> 07:37.663
Tell me of Sateda.

07:41.583 --> 07:42.799
What do you want to know?

07:43.578 --> 07:45.343
When did the Wraith destroy it?

07:48.379 --> 07:49.180
Years ago.

07:49.609 --> 07:51.641
Your army was unable to fight?

07:51.946 --> 07:53.357
Oh, we fought back.

07:53.846 --> 07:55.144
The battle lasted days.

07:55.578 --> 07:57.605
And when you finally surrendered,

07:58.166 --> 08:00.260
<i>- What did the Wraith do...</i>
- We didn't surrender.

08:00.380 --> 08:03.611
We fought until every last one of us
was either dead or captured.

08:03.944 --> 08:05.393
So tell me, then...

08:05.964 --> 08:07.648
Is it true that negligence on your part

08:07.768 --> 08:10.409
is what first alerted the Wraith
to your presence?

08:10.569 --> 08:12.813
That your reckless actions
brought about the deaths

08:12.933 --> 08:15.790
of thousands of innocent people...

08:16.608 --> 08:17.625
That's a lie!

08:19.123 --> 08:20.628
Indeed it is.

08:22.067 --> 08:24.966
<i>Yet should such a question arise
during your interview,</i>

08:25.675 --> 08:28.658
I trust you will not respond
in a similar manner.

08:29.488 --> 08:32.097
You do, after all,
know how to play the game.

08:32.440 --> 08:33.246
<i>Ronon!</i>

08:34.467 --> 08:35.270
Put...

08:35.390 --> 08:36.390
the gun...

08:36.755 --> 08:37.575
away.

08:42.578 --> 08:43.905
What's the problem here?

08:44.082 --> 08:45.985
There is no problem, Colonel Sheppard.

08:46.105 --> 08:48.296
Well, that's good to hear. Ronon?

08:53.299 --> 08:54.393
All right...

08:55.513 --> 08:57.646
Why don't you take Teal'c
down to the gym,

08:57.766 --> 08:59.333
show him your fighting techniques?

09:00.019 --> 09:02.336
<i>I'm sure you guys
could give each other a few tips.</i>

09:13.387 --> 09:14.975
Colonel, come to place a bet?

09:15.095 --> 09:17.643
- What's going on here?
- Friendly sparring match.

09:21.057 --> 09:22.553
It looks anything but friendly.

09:22.673 --> 09:25.234
No, it's good for 'em.
They're just blowing off some steam.

09:29.398 --> 09:30.990
Go! Go! Go!

09:31.150 --> 09:33.117
- How long have they been at it?
- About an hour.

09:33.278 --> 09:34.169
An hour?

09:34.289 --> 09:35.809
<i>They're not even taking any breaks.</i>

09:35.929 --> 09:37.344
They are now!

09:37.464 --> 09:39.763
I don't think that's a good idea...

09:39.883 --> 09:41.537
Okay, that's enough!

10:02.494 --> 10:04.015
Ronon! Teal'c! Stop!

10:06.686 --> 10:08.110
Let's call it a draw.

10:29.698 --> 10:31.095
Why does he have to go with me?

10:31.215 --> 10:33.448
He's not actually going with you.
He's returning home.

10:33.568 --> 10:35.665
He just happens to be traveling
at the same time.

10:35.785 --> 10:38.289
One less dial-in
on the intergalactic bridge.

10:38.409 --> 10:41.294
That's the other thing. Why don't we
just dial Earth directly from here?

10:41.414 --> 10:44.104
We need a ZPM for that, and 
we don't want to waste the extra power.

10:44.224 --> 10:46.704
That was the whole point
of the Gate bridge in the first place.

10:46.824 --> 10:49.344
But there's a 24-hour quarantine
on the Midway station.

10:49.464 --> 10:51.517
Well, you're just going
to have to sit around a bit,

10:51.637 --> 10:53.141
all right? Look.

10:53.805 --> 10:57.610
The guy's got years of experience.
He's, like, 100 years old or something.

10:57.992 --> 10:59.578
It won't kill you to listen to him.

11:00.466 --> 11:01.539
Be a good boy.

11:02.868 --> 11:03.874
I hate you.

11:04.171 --> 11:06.593
I'm sorry about breaking up
the sparring match earlier,

11:06.713 --> 11:09.065
but if I didn't, you two would probably
still be fighting.

11:10.461 --> 11:13.017
Listen, I know
that Ronon's been resistant,

11:13.287 --> 11:15.993
but I really appreciate
you coming here and helping us out.

11:16.113 --> 11:17.920
I too wish him to succeed.

11:18.040 --> 11:20.331
- There is great potential in him.
- I agree.

11:21.697 --> 11:22.668
All set?

11:22.955 --> 11:24.353
Let's get this over with.

11:28.650 --> 11:30.675
- Dial the bridge, Chuck.
<i>- Yes, Ma'am.</i>

11:33.059 --> 11:35.669
It gives me great pride
to see how the people of this expedition

11:35.789 --> 11:37.692
have embraced you as their leader.

11:37.812 --> 11:39.256
As I knew they would.

11:39.810 --> 11:41.109
Thanks, Teal'c.

11:50.810 --> 11:52.546
The Portal's activating!

11:57.479 --> 11:59.423
<i>The patterns are stored in the buffer.</i>

11:59.543 --> 12:01.265
<i>The Portal should re-dial momentarily.</i>

12:08.099 --> 12:09.575
<i>Incoming Pegasus activation.</i>

12:30.337 --> 12:32.004
<i>Right on schedule.</i>

12:32.409 --> 12:33.948
I'm going to go get them settled in.

12:34.068 --> 12:37.671
You can get started on the attitude
stabilization diagnostics.

12:38.053 --> 12:39.553
I thought Dempster was doing that.

12:39.953 --> 12:41.722
- Why do I have to do that?
- You don't.

12:41.893 --> 12:44.091
- I want you to do it.
- I just finished five hours

12:44.211 --> 12:46.857
- of power-distribution upgrades.
- You chose to be here.

12:46.977 --> 12:48.508
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did.

12:48.628 --> 12:51.515
Regardless, I want you to learn
everything about this station,

12:51.635 --> 12:54.766
and the sooner you do that, the sooner
I get to hand you the reins and go home.

12:56.308 --> 12:58.144
You're not the only one
who wants to go home.

12:58.264 --> 12:59.827
I heard that.

13:01.669 --> 13:02.580
Gentlemen!

13:02.700 --> 13:05.349
Welcome to the Midway station,
half-way point between

13:05.469 --> 13:07.071
the Pegasus and Milky Way galaxies.

13:07.191 --> 13:08.916
Yeah, we know. We've been here before.

13:09.036 --> 13:12.388
Of course. So then you also know
about the 24-hour quarantine

13:12.508 --> 13:14.900
before we can let you carry on to Earth?

13:15.228 --> 13:17.891
Don't want to pass on
any of those pesky Pegasus germs

13:18.011 --> 13:19.543
to the folks back home.

13:19.952 --> 13:22.566
Why don't I just
show you to your quarters?

13:22.686 --> 13:24.896
Unfortunately,
you're going to have to share.

13:25.016 --> 13:27.101
As you know, there's not
much room on the station.

13:27.354 --> 13:29.599
There's a DVD player and a few movies.

13:29.719 --> 13:32.726
Oh! We sawn Orbit the other day.
It's actually... It's kind of funny.

13:32.846 --> 13:34.599
There's some sudoku books...

13:34.719 --> 13:37.368
Although I think...
No, they're all solved.

13:38.548 --> 13:41.309
Like I said, it's a bit small, but...

13:41.705 --> 13:46.120
You're only here for a day,
so kick back, relax, have an earl grey,

13:46.240 --> 13:49.250
and get to know each other better,
or... not.

14:07.310 --> 14:10.035
I have deciphered the program.

14:10.640 --> 14:12.879
Prepare the first wave!

14:18.705 --> 14:20.185
How's it going?

14:21.073 --> 14:22.012
Peachy.

14:22.810 --> 14:25.064
You're bored. I get it.

14:25.184 --> 14:26.961
Welcome to Midway.

14:28.681 --> 14:31.021
- Are we expecting another dial-in?
- No.

14:34.353 --> 14:36.778
Unscheduled Pegasus activation.

14:43.170 --> 14:45.763
- What the heck?
- Oh, God! Wraith!

14:48.369 --> 14:49.796
That's impossible!

15:12.336 --> 15:14.021
What are the Wraith doing here?

15:14.141 --> 15:16.289
I was about to ask the same question.

15:21.208 --> 15:22.147
Stop!

15:34.666 --> 15:35.851
Dial Earth.

15:47.719 --> 15:48.818
What's going on?

15:48.938 --> 15:50.707
The intergalactic bridge is down.

15:50.827 --> 15:52.404
- How'd that happen?
- I don't know.

15:52.524 --> 15:54.849
We were sending the daily status
report to the SGC,

15:54.969 --> 15:56.503
and we can't connect to Midway.

15:56.623 --> 15:58.764
<i>Some kind of malfunction
either in one of the Gates</i>

15:58.884 --> 16:00.245
<i>or the call-forwarding macro.</i>

16:00.365 --> 16:02.315
Probably just a glitch.
Simple software hiccup.

16:02.435 --> 16:03.733
- Hiccup?
- We hope.

16:05.825 --> 16:06.828
Ronon and Teal'c?

16:06.948 --> 16:09.382
The malfunction occurred several
minutes after they went through.

16:09.502 --> 16:10.946
I'm sure they made it to Midway.

16:11.066 --> 16:13.475
- But we can't be absolutely certain.
- <i>Those Gates are in space.</i>

16:13.635 --> 16:15.227
- If they walked through...
<i>- No, no.</i>

16:15.387 --> 16:18.606
Look, the glitch occurred
at M4F-788, that is a planetary

16:18.766 --> 16:20.649
<i>Gate at the edge of the Pegasus galaxy,</i>

16:20.809 --> 16:23.112
which means worst-case scenario,
they step through the puddle

16:23.232 --> 16:25.759
and they found themselves stranded
on an uninhabited planet.

16:26.557 --> 16:28.999
Stranded. More time together.
Just what they need.

16:37.112 --> 16:38.881
All right, we need to secure
the Gate room.

16:39.001 --> 16:41.076
No. We must get to the control room.

16:42.024 --> 16:43.864
More Wraith can get
through the Gate.

16:43.984 --> 16:46.145
They cannot use the Stargate
without the control room.

16:46.265 --> 16:47.697
It is best if we just keep...

16:55.410 --> 16:56.318
This way.

17:01.858 --> 17:02.952
What's wrong?

17:03.767 --> 17:05.603
I cannot activate the Portal.

17:06.565 --> 17:08.770
A lockout command
has been initiated.

17:08.890 --> 17:11.512
It's preventing me from accessing
the controls.

17:11.806 --> 17:12.830
Override it.

17:13.992 --> 17:15.079
I'm trying...

17:15.984 --> 17:17.539
It requires a code.

17:20.498 --> 17:21.787
What is the code?

17:22.496 --> 17:23.680
We don't know.

17:25.061 --> 17:26.001
Honestly.

17:26.698 --> 17:29.083
We don't know.
There's only a handful of people

17:29.203 --> 17:32.806
who know that specific code,
for obvious security reasons, and...

17:33.434 --> 17:34.848
None are on the base right now.

17:35.220 --> 17:36.684
You initiated the lockout?

17:37.361 --> 17:39.399
Well, it's not really a matter
of who initiated it.

17:39.519 --> 17:41.230
- It's standard protocol...
- Did you?

17:41.633 --> 17:43.919
But, I mean, yeah it was me, but...

17:44.039 --> 17:45.901
like I said, initiating it and

17:46.061 --> 17:48.070
overriding it are
two entirely separate...

17:48.230 --> 17:49.168
Silence!

17:53.338 --> 17:55.615
Keep working.
Find a way around it.

17:56.266 --> 17:57.560
It will take time.

17:57.776 --> 17:59.915
- The interface has several...
- The more you speak

18:00.075 --> 18:01.938
the less time you have.

18:03.349 --> 18:04.826
In the meantime,

18:05.326 --> 18:08.464
perhaps I can find a way
to persuade you

18:08.756 --> 18:10.609
to give me that code.

18:15.502 --> 18:16.598
<i>We've got a lock.</i>

18:17.146 --> 18:18.144
Finally.

18:18.264 --> 18:20.412
Yeah, seems someone
dialing out from 788,

18:20.532 --> 18:22.643
which was preventing us
from dialing in, until now.

18:22.763 --> 18:24.399
- Ronon and Teal'c?
- Oh, I doubt it.

18:24.519 --> 18:26.862
Look, even if the malfunction
spat them out on the planet,

18:26.982 --> 18:29.389
the only logical address
they would dial is back to Atlantis,

18:29.509 --> 18:30.870
which as we know, they didn't.

18:30.990 --> 18:32.781
Maybe it's them and
they can't get a lock.

18:34.297 --> 18:36.099
Ronon, Teal'c.
Are you there?

18:38.924 --> 18:41.768
Ronon, Teal'c, this is Colonel Carter.
Please respond.

18:42.396 --> 18:44.421
I'm telling you, they made it
to the Midway station

18:44.541 --> 18:46.211
before the malfunction.
I'm sure of it.

18:46.713 --> 18:47.713
<i>Wait a minute.</i>

18:48.395 --> 18:51.154
- Didn't you say 788 is uninhabited?
- It is.

18:51.274 --> 18:54.094
All right, if it's not Ronon and Teal'c,
then who dialed out?

19:01.229 --> 19:02.740
The malp is through.

19:03.023 --> 19:04.513
Receiving telemetry.

19:05.395 --> 19:06.854
Visual coming in now.

19:11.769 --> 19:13.775
See? No Ronon, no Teal'c.

19:14.022 --> 19:15.032
Pan left.

19:20.210 --> 19:21.371
<i>That's Wraith tech.</i>

19:22.208 --> 19:23.456
It's hooked up to the DHD.

19:23.617 --> 19:24.637
Pan right.

19:31.836 --> 19:32.674
Oh, crap.

19:37.463 --> 19:38.716
We lost the feed.

19:38.836 --> 19:41.141
Not to mention the malp.
Shut down the Gate.

19:41.301 --> 19:43.727
Is it possible for them to have
hijacked the intergalactic bridge?

19:43.847 --> 19:45.579
That's a hell of a lot more
than a hiccup.

19:45.699 --> 19:47.746
No impossible. They'd have
to know about the bridge,

19:47.866 --> 19:50.016
And if they did, there're too many
security barriers.

19:50.136 --> 19:52.896
The encryption I used in the call
forwarding macros would take years to...

19:53.016 --> 19:54.738
- What if they knew the passwords?
- How?

19:54.898 --> 19:56.544
We just had a Wraith
on base, Rodney,

19:56.664 --> 19:58.645
working with you, side by side,
on your computers.

19:58.819 --> 20:00.565
You mean Todd?
He was our ally.

20:00.685 --> 20:03.522
Look, and even if he wanted to, there's
no way he could hack into my system...

20:03.642 --> 20:05.582
- Could he?
<i>- You saw the tech hooked up</i>

20:05.742 --> 20:07.584
to the DHD.
What else could they be up to?

20:09.246 --> 20:10.465
We have to get to Midway.

20:10.585 --> 20:13.006
The daedalus's back on Earth.
Is there another way to get there?

20:13.166 --> 20:15.384
Connect to the bridge
via another Gate in Pegasus?

20:15.544 --> 20:17.177
We have to find one
close to the edge.

20:21.147 --> 20:23.706
M6R-125. We could connect
to the bridge through that but,

20:23.826 --> 20:25.936
- I'd need to reconfigure the macros.
<i>- OK, get on it.</i>

20:26.203 --> 20:28.306
Colonel, prepare a strike force.

20:40.170 --> 20:42.953
Honestly, if I knew the code,
I would have given it to you by now.

20:43.113 --> 20:45.247
That depends on the strength
of your allegiance.

20:45.407 --> 20:47.714
No, no, trust me!
My allegiance is not that strong.

20:47.834 --> 20:48.834
It really isn't.

20:48.994 --> 20:50.836
<i>Please. Please!
I'm begging you!</i>

20:56.293 --> 20:57.759
I think he fainted.

20:58.641 --> 20:59.970
Then you shall be next.

21:00.659 --> 21:02.389
- Wait...
- I've got it.

21:05.188 --> 21:08.061
I've successfully gained access
to override the lockout.

21:08.221 --> 21:08.985
Good.

21:09.105 --> 21:10.147
Dial the Portal.

21:21.219 --> 21:22.129
In here.

21:30.410 --> 21:31.995
They're heading to the Gate room.

21:32.115 --> 21:32.996
Indeed.

21:35.833 --> 21:37.925
If you want to go to the control room,
go ahead...

21:38.045 --> 21:39.447
I'm going after them.

21:39.567 --> 21:40.462
Ronon!

21:42.833 --> 21:44.198
Send the device.

21:45.556 --> 21:46.415
Device?

21:47.165 --> 21:48.429
What device?

21:49.566 --> 21:51.025
<i>Offworld activation!</i>

21:53.811 --> 21:55.025
Midway's IDC.

21:55.559 --> 21:56.851
Opening the iris.

22:39.078 --> 22:40.570
<i>All right, we're redirected.</i>

22:40.730 --> 22:43.227
We gate from Atlantis to M6R-125.

22:43.347 --> 22:45.668
We insert this crystal
with the bridge macros

22:45.788 --> 22:48.230
into the DHD,
dial the first Gate in the void,

22:48.350 --> 22:50.238
and we're back on track,
all the way to Midway.

22:50.358 --> 22:52.627
- Is your strike force ready?
- As soon as McKay gears up,

22:52.747 --> 22:54.723
- we're ready to go.
- Well, I'm...

22:54.843 --> 22:56.594
All right, I'm gearing up.

23:02.918 --> 23:04.590
Prepare the next wave.

23:15.048 --> 23:16.613
They have dialed the Milky Way Gate.

23:16.733 --> 23:18.675
They're heading
for Stargate Command.

23:18.795 --> 23:19.988
We must pursue them.

23:20.108 --> 23:21.494
Now you're talking.

23:27.982 --> 23:30.203
Let's go before the Gate shuts down!

23:32.661 --> 23:34.374
Shut it down! Now!

23:42.838 --> 23:44.783
Two were able to pass through.

23:45.292 --> 23:47.447
But they will be dispensed of
soon enough.

23:47.567 --> 23:50.807
<i>- Make ready the next...</i>
- The Pegasus Portal is activating!

23:51.098 --> 23:54.188
The next inbound wave was
supposed to wait for my command.

24:09.369 --> 24:13.093
Teams 3 and 4, take the lower level.
Teams 1 and 2 with me, this way.

24:26.879 --> 24:29.270
Yeah, they're alive,
they're just stunned.

24:29.629 --> 24:31.323
By this device, perhaps.

24:31.885 --> 24:32.900
I don't know.

24:33.020 --> 24:34.947
Never seen one of these before.

24:35.067 --> 24:37.975
It appears other personnel
have been disabled as well.

24:38.450 --> 24:41.646
The question is how much of this base
has been compromised?

24:42.569 --> 24:44.729
And where the hell are the Wraith?

25:00.754 --> 25:02.087
Ronon, Teal'c, come in!

25:05.381 --> 25:07.128
Ronon, do you copy?

25:10.879 --> 25:11.879
Shut the door.

25:24.011 --> 25:24.890
Clear.

25:31.817 --> 25:32.867
<i>Colonel Sheppard.</i>

25:33.942 --> 25:34.905
Sheppard!

25:37.032 --> 25:39.541
<i>You have no chance
of retaking this station.</i>

25:39.702 --> 25:42.080
<i>Therefore, it is
in your best interests</i>

25:42.200 --> 25:43.758
<i>to surrender immediately.</i>

25:43.878 --> 25:44.963
Do I know you?

25:45.123 --> 25:46.550
<i>Not personally, no.</i>

25:47.094 --> 25:49.009
<i>But I know a great deal about you.</i>

25:49.444 --> 25:51.928
<i>- You as well, Dr. McKay.</i>
- Who are you?

25:52.088 --> 25:54.264
An acquaintance of someone
you recently worked with

25:54.630 --> 25:57.183
to bring about the demise
of those you referred to as

25:57.576 --> 25:58.760
"Replicators."

25:59.983 --> 26:02.817
It was from him that I was able
to procure the necessary data

26:02.937 --> 26:04.149
to commandeer this base.

26:04.464 --> 26:06.610
It was Todd.
That bastard hacked my system.

26:06.944 --> 26:08.346
<i>So much for buddies.</i>

26:08.855 --> 26:09.660
<i>So...</i>

26:10.035 --> 26:11.072
<i>what's the plan?</i>

26:11.232 --> 26:12.880
Take over Midway,
and then what? Earth?

26:13.000 --> 26:14.200
My warriors are securing

26:14.362 --> 26:17.162
a beachhead in your command center
as we speak.

26:17.442 --> 26:20.080
Hate to break this to you,
but the SGC is heavily fortified.

26:20.200 --> 26:21.750
You're walking into a world of hurt.

26:22.755 --> 26:23.843
<i>Not to worry.</i>

26:24.194 --> 26:26.313
<i>We have ways of evening the odds.</i>

26:35.490 --> 26:36.314
Look,

26:36.679 --> 26:39.059
they're working their way
to the surface, tryin' to get out.

26:40.612 --> 26:42.145
They will be unable to do so.

26:43.506 --> 26:45.664
A pulse of energy, no doubt
from that Wraith device...

26:45.784 --> 26:48.121
has triggered the SGC
automatic lockdown.

26:48.567 --> 26:50.625
So no one gets in,
and no one gets out?

26:50.745 --> 26:51.571
Indeed.

26:52.022 --> 26:53.638
Just the way I like it.

26:58.981 --> 27:00.345
We have activation.

27:01.355 --> 27:02.791
That will be our reinforcements.

27:04.569 --> 27:05.298
Soon,

27:05.418 --> 27:08.088
it is you who will be in
for a world of hurt.

27:08.400 --> 27:09.420
<i>Oh, crap.</i>

27:10.443 --> 27:13.385
<i>Listen, love to sit around and chat,
but... gotta go.</i>

27:16.393 --> 27:18.378
Take positions.
Anything comes through the Gate,

27:18.498 --> 27:19.716
- kill it.
- Yes, Sir.

27:19.836 --> 27:22.022
- You two, with me.
- Where're we going?

27:22.142 --> 27:24.738
To the control room,
to shut down the Gate.

27:47.731 --> 27:48.878
Oh, thank God.

27:49.693 --> 27:51.386
- Where's the head guy?
<i>- He left.</i>

27:51.506 --> 27:53.500
Well, I can see that. Where'd he go?

27:53.620 --> 27:55.343
I don't know. He just ran out.

27:55.594 --> 27:57.387
McKay, we're in the clear!
Get to work!

27:59.695 --> 28:00.948
Where's Ronon and Teal'c?

28:01.068 --> 28:03.314
They went through the Milky Way Gate
on the way to the SGC,

28:03.434 --> 28:05.698
- chasing after the Wraith.
- All right. Here.

28:05.818 --> 28:07.385
- What am I...
- Get them inside.

28:07.505 --> 28:09.652
Seal the door, shoot anything
that tries to get through.

28:09.772 --> 28:12.453
- Where are you going?
- To go help those marines.

28:13.090 --> 28:14.840
- Is he dead?
- Fainted.

28:15.194 --> 28:16.989
- Figures.
<i>- You better wake him up.</i>

28:17.109 --> 28:18.575
<i>- We got a problem.</i>
- What?

28:19.175 --> 28:20.368
Can't shut the Stargate.

28:20.818 --> 28:24.122
I saw them inputting a lockout protocol
just before you guys came in.

28:24.505 --> 28:25.613
<i>Damn it!</i>

28:27.526 --> 28:30.628
More Wraith coming through the Gate.
We're about to get overrun.

28:45.709 --> 28:47.194
Hester, come in, what's your 20?

28:47.314 --> 28:49.935
<i>We're still outside the Gate room.
We got a ton of Wraith coming through.</i>

28:50.055 --> 28:52.483
- Where are the other teams?
- <i>I lost contact with them.</i>

28:52.603 --> 28:55.046
<i>I don't know how much longer
we can hold 'em off here, Sir.</i>

28:55.166 --> 28:57.565
Just hang on, McKay's trying
to shut down the Gate.

29:00.093 --> 29:01.091
Hester?

29:01.296 --> 29:02.225
Hester!

29:02.882 --> 29:03.974
Come in!

29:25.316 --> 29:26.902
Fed on by the Wraith.

29:27.107 --> 29:28.979
That's not a good way to go.

29:30.381 --> 29:31.420
Indeed.

29:32.883 --> 29:34.345
You say that a lot.

29:35.159 --> 29:37.078
- What?
- "Indeed."

29:39.534 --> 29:40.534
Do I?

29:42.522 --> 29:44.148
I had not noticed.

30:11.753 --> 30:14.065
I would very much like
to have a weapon such as this.

30:14.225 --> 30:15.115
Yeah?

30:15.429 --> 30:16.276
Get in line.

30:22.401 --> 30:23.742
Rodney, talk to me.

30:24.285 --> 30:25.503
Still working.

30:26.220 --> 30:28.038
<i>I lost contact
with Hester and the Marines.</i>

30:28.158 --> 30:29.781
<i>I think they were killed.</i>

30:30.975 --> 30:32.850
How long before you can
get the Gate shut down?

30:32.970 --> 30:34.912
I don't know,
this is extremely complicated...

30:35.032 --> 30:36.452
Try the critical systems bypass.

30:36.572 --> 30:38.506
I have to figure out how
to avoid any commands

30:38.667 --> 30:40.077
<i>that may have been compromised.</i>

30:40.197 --> 30:42.029
Hurry up!
We got more Wraith on the way.

30:42.214 --> 30:44.036
I'm working as fast as I can!

30:44.156 --> 30:47.265
- You can bypass the critical systems.
- Not now. Just watch the door.

30:47.425 --> 30:49.251
Besides,
even if I could shut down the Gate,

30:49.371 --> 30:51.094
there's Wraith in all the base!

30:51.546 --> 30:53.688
<i>We're completely outnumbered.
It's just a matter of time</i>

30:53.848 --> 30:55.331
<i>before they wipe us all out...</i>

30:56.536 --> 30:58.162
The Gate just shut off.

31:00.322 --> 31:01.237
What'd you do?

31:02.848 --> 31:05.158
I shut it off,
using the critical systems bypass.

31:05.318 --> 31:06.784
Are you out of your mind?

31:06.944 --> 31:08.386
What? It worked.

31:11.848 --> 31:13.583
Oh, my God.
The self-destruct.

31:14.496 --> 31:17.253
<i>Did you not just hear me say I needed
to figure out a safe work-around</i>

31:17.413 --> 31:20.256
to avoid any commands that may have
been compromised? As in booby-trapped?

31:20.416 --> 31:23.218
Look, I didn't use the bypass to
shut down the Gate for this very reason!

31:23.533 --> 31:25.768
- Rodney?
- <i>We've made a terrible mistake!</i>

31:26.037 --> 31:27.664
<i>We never should've revived Kavanagh!</i>

31:27.784 --> 31:29.224
He triggered the self-destruct?

31:29.384 --> 31:31.395
- Not on purpose!
- That doesn't really matter now.

31:31.515 --> 31:33.285
All right, we've got
just under 10 minutes

31:33.405 --> 31:34.971
before this whole station blows up.

31:35.283 --> 31:37.841
- Can you turn it off?
- <i>No, we're completely locked out!</i>

31:38.059 --> 31:40.546
<i>They made sure if they couldn't
have the station, then no one could.</i>

31:40.848 --> 31:42.748
This couldn't get any worse.

31:46.943 --> 31:48.726
They're shooting at the door.

31:59.792 --> 32:00.735
Wait.

32:07.162 --> 32:08.542
Are you all right?

32:10.483 --> 32:11.741
Ronon Dex,

32:12.246 --> 32:14.310
this is Mr. Coolidge of the IOA.

32:16.731 --> 32:17.688
What happened?

32:17.808 --> 32:20.681
You were rendered unconscious
by a Wraith stun device.

32:20.911 --> 32:21.849
What?

32:22.410 --> 32:24.467
There are Wraith... Here?

32:24.726 --> 32:26.941
They have infiltrated the base.

32:27.822 --> 32:29.447
It is best if you remain in this room

32:29.567 --> 32:31.702
until Ronon Dex and I
have neutralized the situation.

32:31.822 --> 32:33.930
No, we need to get to the control room,
radio for help.

32:34.050 --> 32:35.447
We don't need help.

32:35.567 --> 32:37.035
How many Wraith are here?

32:37.155 --> 32:39.280
We do not know exact numbers,
but there are many.

32:39.400 --> 32:41.285
And who else besides you
are going after them?

32:41.405 --> 32:42.808
We are the only two.

32:42.928 --> 32:44.841
- Get me to a radio. Now!
- It's better if we...

32:54.247 --> 32:55.475
I've got an idea, Rodney.

32:55.636 --> 32:57.812
Great, we've got Wraith
about to blast through the door.

32:58.266 --> 33:00.315
This place has got
a Jumper docked here, right?

33:00.646 --> 33:02.600
Yeah, to be used
as an emergency escape pod.

33:03.415 --> 33:06.404
Well, I'd say this pretty much
qualifies as an emergency.

33:06.564 --> 33:09.292
No... We'll be stuck out here
in the middle of the galactic void.

33:09.412 --> 33:12.798
They'll mount a rescue. The Jumper
is stocked with food and water.

33:12.918 --> 33:14.329
Unless you want to stay here,

33:14.489 --> 33:16.886
get blown to smithereens
with the rest of the station. Your call!

33:17.006 --> 33:18.625
<i>We got one other problem.</i>

33:19.515 --> 33:21.278
How are we gonna get there?

33:35.843 --> 33:37.756
<i>Rodney.
We're out of time.</i>

33:38.156 --> 33:39.847
- <i>Vent the atmosphere.</i>
- What?

33:39.967 --> 33:42.006
<i>Every room but the control room.
Vent the air.</i>

33:42.126 --> 33:43.149
How close are you?

33:43.534 --> 33:44.608
Just do it.

33:44.728 --> 33:46.861
- <i>Can you make it to the Jumper?</i>
- Don't know. I'll try!

33:47.021 --> 33:50.907
- John, I'm not sure there's time to...
- <i>We don't have time to argue! Do it!</i>

33:59.016 --> 34:00.670
Venting the atmosphere.

35:21.449 --> 35:22.501
All right,

35:22.911 --> 35:24.920
I'll go this way.
You go that way.

35:25.412 --> 35:27.011
Where is Mr. Coolidge?

35:28.227 --> 35:29.389
I don't know.

35:39.684 --> 35:41.556
It's pretty quiet out there.

35:42.103 --> 35:43.825
Looks like they're all dead.

35:44.411 --> 35:46.435
Sheppard, can you hear me?

35:48.286 --> 35:49.708
John, are you there?

35:52.264 --> 35:53.890
It should be enough time.

35:54.492 --> 35:56.569
I think it's safe to repressurize.

35:58.264 --> 35:59.439
Dr. McKay?

36:02.132 --> 36:03.703
Repressurizing the station.

36:13.695 --> 36:15.600
- What you doing?
- I've contacted the military.

36:15.720 --> 36:18.357
They're fully aware of the situation,
which means, unfortunately,

36:18.477 --> 36:20.753
- they're preparing to nuke the base.
- What?

36:20.873 --> 36:22.871
Stargate Command has been compromised.

36:22.991 --> 36:24.894
Only way to prevent the Wraith
from infiltrating

36:25.054 --> 36:26.604
the population is to destroy it.

36:26.764 --> 36:28.689
- Tell them to call it off.
- I can't do that.

36:28.849 --> 36:31.567
Not as long as a single Wraith
is still alive on this base.

36:31.727 --> 36:34.862
- Wraith? What, here?
- Listen, we'll deal with the Wraith.

36:34.982 --> 36:37.035
You've got people alive here.
Buy us some more time.

36:37.155 --> 36:39.580
We don't have time.
There's an escape to the surface.

36:39.700 --> 36:42.370
We need to get to it immediately.
Where's Teal'c?

36:43.669 --> 36:45.047
 I need to get back to him.

36:45.167 --> 36:48.042
- No time! We have to leave.
- Not without Teal'c.

36:48.202 --> 36:50.086
We can't go back for him.

36:50.474 --> 36:52.374
We could get bogged down or killed!

36:52.494 --> 36:55.914
There's a clear path to the escape,
and we need to get out of here now!

36:56.034 --> 36:58.553
You wanna run away and save yourself?
Fine! I'm stayin' here.

37:02.159 --> 37:04.759
- The Jumper bay is...
- Through the EVA prep room.

37:04.879 --> 37:07.176
It's not a real bay, though.
It's more like an airlock

37:07.296 --> 37:09.656
- that leads to a hatch that's...
- I don't need the blueprints!

37:09.776 --> 37:11.661
- Where is it?
- It's over there.

37:19.992 --> 37:21.181
Through here.

37:39.663 --> 37:40.568
Sheppard!

37:40.688 --> 37:42.997
- How the hell did you...
- Get me outta here.

38:47.947 --> 38:49.163
Excellent timing.

38:50.188 --> 38:51.213
Indeed.

38:59.646 --> 39:01.586
Well, I think that's all of them.

39:05.126 --> 39:07.272
I certainly hope you are correct.

39:07.450 --> 39:10.555
We gotta call the military.
They're gonna blow this place up.

39:12.138 --> 39:13.469
What's taking him so long?

39:13.589 --> 39:15.481
Self-destruct's about to blow.
20 seconds!

39:21.605 --> 39:23.609
- Colonel Sheppard! How did you...
- Later.

39:23.729 --> 39:25.642
We're leaving. Sit down!

39:49.806 --> 39:51.050
Ronon Dex...

39:52.506 --> 39:55.265
Do you feel that you can fulfill
the duties of an SG team member with

39:55.413 --> 39:56.561
diligence,

39:56.845 --> 39:58.034
integrity...

39:59.141 --> 40:01.915
and respect for those
in authority over you?

40:07.805 --> 40:08.816
Yes.

40:19.436 --> 40:20.838
Good enough for me.

40:30.891 --> 40:31.779
Well?

40:32.820 --> 40:36.699
I'm exactly the kind of team member
they want out there fighting the Wraith.

40:37.229 --> 40:38.829
Their words, not mine.

40:39.146 --> 40:41.240
And you did not hold a weapon
to their heads?

40:41.360 --> 40:42.398
I did not.

40:43.233 --> 40:44.668
I am pleased.

40:45.228 --> 40:46.977
Yeah, well, I had a good coach.

40:47.278 --> 40:48.276
Indeed.

40:49.379 --> 40:51.447
The Daedalus is preparing to leave.

40:51.939 --> 40:54.698
Colonel Caldwell will beam you aboard
when you are ready.

40:54.878 --> 40:56.491
Still nothing from Midway?

40:56.879 --> 40:57.708
No.

40:57.926 --> 40:59.895
We have lost all contact with them.

41:00.605 --> 41:03.963
The Daedalus will stop on its way back
to Atlantis to assess the situation.

41:14.802 --> 41:16.674
No way.
You actually liked it?

41:16.879 --> 41:18.191
It's his finest film.

41:18.478 --> 41:19.721
Pearl Harbor?

41:20.007 --> 41:23.062
Go ahead and mock it... Everybody does.
But that film will endure, got weight.

41:23.182 --> 41:25.429
Yeah, which is why it plummeted
at the box office!

41:25.549 --> 41:26.947
$200 million domestic.

41:27.067 --> 41:29.509
- That's not plummeting...
- Enough, already!

41:30.067 --> 41:32.119
We've been stuck here
for God knows how long,

41:32.239 --> 41:34.041
and you haven't shut up,
either of you!

41:34.161 --> 41:35.946
You just keep talking and talking...

41:38.584 --> 41:39.667
What was that?

41:39.827 --> 41:41.290
Something just hit us.

41:45.511 --> 41:47.466
- Ronon!
- Where are we?

41:47.726 --> 41:48.821
Daedalus, 302 bay.

41:48.941 --> 41:50.462
We saw you, scooped you up,

41:50.629 --> 41:52.596
- heading back to Atlantis.
- Thank God!

41:54.118 --> 41:56.264
- Midway was destroyed.
- Yeah, we saw.

41:56.442 --> 41:57.822
Where's Sheppard?

41:59.858 --> 42:02.373
He lasted about a day,
sealed himself in there.

42:03.392 --> 42:05.566
No wonder he didn't hear the radio call.

42:17.665 --> 42:19.155
Thank God!

42:20.987 --> 42:22.710
I almost shot 'em myself with a stunner.

42:22.870 --> 42:24.545
Yeah. I understand.

42:26.002 --> 42:28.360
- Where are we?
<i>- Daedalus, 302 bay.</i>

42:28.906 --> 42:30.384
What's the status of SGC?

42:30.544 --> 42:32.887
Secure. Teal'c and I
took care of the Wraith.

42:33.047 --> 42:34.513
I figured you would.

42:34.673 --> 42:36.768
Come on, let's get the hell outta here.

42:36.888 --> 42:37.913
Yeah.

42:39.923 --> 42:42.446
And I passed my interview with the IOA.

42:42.660 --> 42:45.055
- Really?
- Yeah, they said they liked me.

42:45.175 --> 42:47.020
Well, what's not to like?
