Uncle Maurice has a story to tell.

00:52.469 --> 00:55.890
Once upon a time,
in a place called Madagascar,

00:55.973 --> 00:59.267
there was a lemur named King Julien XIII.

00:59.351 --> 01:02.646
And King Julien XIII had a problem.

01:02.730 --> 01:04.773
I have no legacy!

01:05.649 --> 01:07.484
No one is going to remember me!

01:07.568 --> 01:09.486
"Who are you?" "No idea."

01:09.570 --> 01:11.071
"Never seen you before.

01:11.154 --> 01:12.865
FYI, you are very handsome."

01:12.948 --> 01:14.074
"Oh, thank you very much."

01:14.157 --> 01:15.116
I'm freaking out, man!

01:15.200 --> 01:18.078
There are many things
you'll be remembered for.

-Name one.
-Um, trampolines.

01:20.205 --> 01:22.374
Bringing laughter and joy
back to the kingdom.

01:22.457 --> 01:26.587
So, my legacy is the same
as a circus pony's.

01:26.670 --> 01:31.592
Don't worry, King Julien,
when you go, your feet will live on.

01:31.675 --> 01:33.802
I've already built the display box.

01:33.886 --> 01:35.178

01:35.554 --> 01:37.347

01:37.431 --> 01:40.099
Is that crushed velvet? Very nice.

01:40.183 --> 01:41.852

left behind a line of scented body wash.

01:58.410 --> 02:00.161
That was a terrible legacy.

02:00.245 --> 02:01.789
Well, at least he has one.

02:01.872 --> 02:03.582
From this day forth,

02:03.665 --> 02:07.836
I am putting Operation Legacy into action.

02:07.920 --> 02:12.507

It's pretty clear.

02:37.992 --> 02:42.121

Aren't legacies supposed to help people?

02:42.203 --> 02:43.204

I think lemur booties shaking
to KJ-branded music and live performances,

10:29.754 --> 10:31.298
That's the shock talking, baby.

10:31.381 --> 10:33.467
Don't say another word without our lawyer.

10:33.550 --> 10:35.260
Tammy, I don't know what to say.

10:35.343 --> 10:36.595
That's okay, Mo-Mo. I got this.

10:36.677 --> 10:38.721
Why couldn't it have been you?

10:38.805 --> 10:40.348
Your body would've absorbed the blow

10:40.432 --> 10:41.766
and my stage wouldn't be ruined.

10:41.849 --> 10:44.478
King Julien! He didn't mean that.

10:44.561 --> 10:46.813
Don't worry, we'll make sure
Todd is well taken--

10:46.896 --> 10:50.066
Yes, Todd will have the best doctor
in the kingdom.

10:50.150 --> 10:51.734
Respeck, Todd. Respeck!

10:52.944 --> 10:55.405
Your Majesty, we don't have
doctors in the kingdom.

10:55.489 --> 10:56.864
Quiet, Maurice, I know.

10:56.948 --> 10:59.700
I'm using child psychology
to make him feel better.

10:59.784 --> 11:02.078
The doctor will be by shortly.

11:02.745 --> 11:04.498
I've done a complete perimeter search.

11:04.581 --> 11:06.416
No sign of the Phantom. Or Mort.

11:06.500 --> 11:08.668
Oh, sweet Mort.

11:09.252 --> 11:11.254
We'll have to assume the Phantom ate him.

11:11.338 --> 11:13.256
Uh, why would we assume that?

11:13.340 --> 11:14.299
How should I know?

11:14.382 --> 11:18.303
You're the fancy detective, Clover.
Isn't knowing his diet your job?

11:18.886 --> 11:19.929
Crazy thought.

11:20.013 --> 11:23.350
Could this be Rob exacting revenge
for starting the club without him?

11:23.433 --> 11:24.976
Don't be ridiculous,

11:25.059 --> 11:26.894
Rob looked nothing like the Phantom.

11:26.978 --> 11:29.314
-But the Phantom wears a mask.
-Precisely!

11:29.397 --> 11:32.233
And Rob never wore a mask, ergo not Rob.

11:32.317 --> 11:33.276
It's science, Maurice.

11:33.360 --> 11:35.487
Xixi, how are reservations?
Any cancellations?

11:35.570 --> 11:37.656
Uh... All of them?

11:38.990 --> 11:42.577
[sobbing]

11:44.579 --> 11:46.122
I'm sorry, Your Majesty.

11:46.206 --> 11:49.792
I know how badly you wanted
Club Moist to be your legacy.

11:49.876 --> 11:50.877
Yes, Maurice.

11:50.960 --> 11:54.506
It would appear that
Club Moist is finished...

11:54.589 --> 11:59.010
to someone who's blind.
But to someone who has sight and vision,

11:59.093 --> 12:01.471
and isn't ready to give up on his dream,

12:01.555 --> 12:04.307
this is merely an obstacle
to be dodged and weaved.

12:04.391 --> 12:05.266
Watch me do it!

12:06.351 --> 12:07.935
"You ain't so bad." [huffing]

12:08.019 --> 12:10.271
"Ain't gonna be no rematch."
"Don't want one."

12:10.855 --> 12:13.149
-Yeah, he's lost it.
-I'll get the restraints.

12:13.233 --> 12:15.402
Xixi, get a dart,
we may need to tranq him.

12:15.485 --> 12:19.406
Save the restraints and your sleepy darts
for the after-party, Maurice.

12:19.489 --> 12:22.409
This king has been in worse spots
and you know what he learned?

12:22.492 --> 12:24.536
Sometimes it's better
to quit and walk away?

12:24.619 --> 12:26.162
Yes. I mean, no!

12:26.745 --> 12:30.083
This king has learned as long
as there is blood in his booty

12:30.166 --> 12:32.960
and thoughts in his brainy parts,
there is hope.

12:33.044 --> 12:35.380
Club Moist will rise again

12:35.463 --> 12:37.756
and no "Phantom" is going to stop it.

12:37.840 --> 12:40.051
Xixi, I need you to spread the word,

12:40.134 --> 12:42.429
Club Moist is coming back
bigger than ever,

12:42.512 --> 12:44.305
and I want tushies in these seats.

12:44.389 --> 12:45.265
[Xixi groans]

12:45.348 --> 12:46.600
-Clover!
-Yes, Your Majesty!

12:46.683 --> 12:49.102
If the Phantom shows up again,
I wanna be ready.

12:49.185 --> 12:50.520
Get to work on a trap.

12:50.604 --> 12:54.232
A trap that is so insane,
it even freaks you out.

12:54.315 --> 12:56.025
I'm talking full psycho.

12:56.109 --> 12:57.569
Let your freak flag fly!

12:57.652 --> 12:59.946
I have dreamed of a moment like this,

13:00.029 --> 13:02.282
but I never thought it would happen.

13:02.574 --> 13:03.700
What should we use as bait?

13:03.782 --> 13:06.035
Something alive and helpless is preferred.

13:06.119 --> 13:08.413
Normally, the words
"bait, alive, and helpless"

13:08.496 --> 13:11.165
would equal Mort,
but since he has been eaten...

13:11.249 --> 13:13.376
-We don't know that.
-...I will take his place

13:13.460 --> 13:15.629
as both bait and headliner! [laughs]

13:15.712 --> 13:16.755
[both] What?

13:16.837 --> 13:18.423
Your Majesty, I can't allow that.

13:18.506 --> 13:20.467
You can and you can.

13:20.550 --> 13:22.260
-My legacy, my risk.
-But--

13:22.343 --> 13:24.929
The king's word is final!
Gavel slam. Roll credits.

13:28.308 --> 13:30.351
[straining]

13:35.315 --> 13:37.984
-[thud]
-[groaning]

13:38.401 --> 13:42.196
-[Xixi shouting] Club Moist! Club Moist!
-[rumbling]

13:42.280 --> 13:45.074
Ha! We're never gonna die!

13:46.867 --> 13:48.286
Ooh, mama!

13:48.369 --> 13:50.371
Working up a nice burn.

13:50.455 --> 13:52.499
I'm gonna rock this stage tonight, Mo-Mo.

13:52.582 --> 13:53.750
Gonna rock it!

13:53.832 --> 13:55.960
I would like to go on record again.

13:56.043 --> 13:59.506
You making yourself a target
is an incredibly bad idea.

13:59.589 --> 14:01.215
Concern noted and ignored.

14:01.299 --> 14:02.801
Trap is complete, Your Majesty.

14:02.883 --> 14:05.136
I've rigged the entire club
with an elaborate mix

14:05.219 --> 14:07.972
of swinging boulders,
poisonous vines, buckets of snakes,

14:08.055 --> 14:09.724
spinning knives, flame throwers,

14:09.808 --> 14:11.559
deadly fighter birds, and an acid pit.

14:11.643 --> 14:13.894
In other words,
every deadly thing you could find.

14:13.978 --> 14:17.732
Exactly. And should the Phantom
get past all of them,

14:17.816 --> 14:21.194
I have also trapped a shark
in the toilet hut. Aha!

14:21.277 --> 14:22.278
Wow.

14:22.362 --> 14:26.825
-[roaring]
-[screams] Toilet shark! Oh, my!

14:26.907 --> 14:29.076
Clover, I am proud of you.

14:29.160 --> 14:31.496
You've really out-crazied
your crazy this time.

14:31.579 --> 14:35.249
Whoo! Mission accomplished.

14:35.333 --> 14:38.586
The club is completely sold out
for tonight.

14:38.670 --> 14:40.087
You wanna know how I did it?

14:40.171 --> 14:42.131
Ugh. No, I just ate.

14:42.215 --> 14:44.884
Oh. Cool. I'm gonna crash then.

14:45.968 --> 14:47.679
All right, you heard the bird.

14:47.762 --> 14:49.806
We got a show to put on!

14:50.348 --> 14:51.725
[scorns]

14:55.645 --> 14:56.855
[gargling]

14:57.397 --> 14:59.273
Sister Susie went to sea
to see the sea.

14:59.357 --> 15:01.234
You see, the sea
she saw was a saucy sea.

15:01.317 --> 15:03.277
A sort of saucy sea, saw she. Yes!

15:04.738 --> 15:06.698
[chattering]

15:06.781 --> 15:09.033
Citizens of Madagascar,

15:09.116 --> 15:13.538
he's the ravishing royal
with a flair for the fabulous,

15:13.621 --> 15:15.456
King Julien!

15:15.582 --> 15:18.835
-La-la-la-la-la-la... Me, mow, moo.
-[audience cheering]

15:20.253 --> 15:21.087
Thank...

15:22.296 --> 15:23.130
Thank you.

15:23.757 --> 15:25.884
As many of you probably know,

15:25.966 --> 15:29.929
Club Moist has been a childhood dream
since childhood.

15:30.012 --> 15:33.057
Sure there's no way the Phantom
could get past your trap?

15:33.140 --> 15:35.894
Not unless the Phantom
can turn himself invisible.

15:35.976 --> 15:37.771
Doesn't that sound fun? [laughs]

15:38.563 --> 15:39.898
[Maurice] Or turn off the lights.

15:40.022 --> 15:40.940
[all screaming]

15:41.023 --> 15:43.651
-[lemur 1] I'm in the dark!
-[Julien] What's happening?

15:43.735 --> 15:46.696
-[chainsaw whirring]
-[screaming]

15:46.821 --> 15:49.073
[lemur 2] There's acid in my beverage!

15:49.156 --> 15:50.116
[eagle squawks]

15:50.199 --> 15:52.493
[lemur 3] I believe a bird
is eating my face off.

15:52.577 --> 15:53.745
This is deplorable.

15:53.828 --> 15:55.538
-[lemur 4] We're all gonna--
-[scuffling]

15:55.663 --> 15:57.582
[Clover] Hold on, everybody, I found the--

15:59.292 --> 16:00.627
[panting]

16:00.710 --> 16:01.961
[whimpering]

16:02.211 --> 16:04.881
-[eagle squawking]
-[yelping]

16:04.964 --> 16:07.801
-[both gasp]
-The king! He's gone!

16:08.676 --> 16:12.012
And that was the last
we ever saw of King Julien.

16:12.096 --> 16:13.180
The end.

16:14.599 --> 16:16.601
[laughs] I'm just joshing ya.

16:16.684 --> 16:21.272
Now buckle up, kids, this is the part
of the story where it gets really crazy.

16:24.024 --> 16:25.568
You promised he'd be safe!

16:25.652 --> 16:28.446
How was I to know the Phantom
would turn off the lights?

16:28.529 --> 16:30.239
It was your job to know!

16:31.574 --> 16:33.242
[both sobbing]

16:33.326 --> 16:35.578
I'm sorry and I am not crying.

16:35.662 --> 16:38.205
I just can't believe he's gone.

16:38.289 --> 16:40.708
And I might never again hear him say--

16:40.792 --> 16:42.543
[screaming]

16:42.627 --> 16:45.755
Actually, I was thinking more like,
"To the water slide" or...

16:45.839 --> 16:49.509
-Maurice, I didn't say that.
-[muffled voice] Help me!

16:53.387 --> 16:54.639
Hmm? Hmm?

16:56.307 --> 16:58.142
[Mort] Help me!

16:58.225 --> 16:59.268
Is that...

17:00.603 --> 17:01.437
-Mort?
-Mort!

17:01.521 --> 17:03.564
We thought you'd been eaten.

17:03.648 --> 17:05.650
Sorry, it was power of suggestion.

17:05.733 --> 17:07.527
-What happened?
-The Phantom.

17:07.610 --> 17:12.031
I thought he was just a fan
looking for a piece of Pork. But...

17:12.114 --> 17:13.449
[gasps]

17:13.533 --> 17:15.493
Where's my King Julien? He's in danger!

17:15.576 --> 17:17.036
The Phantom took him, Mort.

17:17.119 --> 17:19.163
-Any idea where they might've gone?
-No!

17:19.246 --> 17:21.040
You're sure? Think, Mort.

17:21.123 --> 17:22.834
King Julien is in serious danger.

17:22.917 --> 17:26.880
Well, the Phantom did say
he came from that secret panel over there

17:26.963 --> 17:29.298
that leads to stairs carved
into the living rock

17:29.382 --> 17:31.801
that spiral down to catacombs beneath.

17:32.635 --> 17:34.094
Pretty vague, huh?

17:34.178 --> 17:35.054
[both] Hmm...

17:40.309 --> 17:41.895
[suspenseful music playing]

17:41.978 --> 17:45.523
[straining]

17:46.190 --> 17:47.066
Who are you?

17:47.149 --> 17:49.610
Isn't it obvious, Julie?

17:49.736 --> 17:50.653
Ah!

17:50.737 --> 17:53.072
Recognize me now?

17:53.155 --> 17:54.365
[shrieks]

17:54.448 --> 17:58.745
Of course I do, you're...
somebody ugly who lives nearby?

17:58.828 --> 18:01.039
Self-absorbed fool!

18:01.121 --> 18:05.376
It's me, Rob "The Party Animal" McTodd.

18:05.459 --> 18:09.630
Former best friend and band mate
you left for dead.

18:09.714 --> 18:12.508
I'd hoped never to see you again,

18:12.592 --> 18:16.262
but then you went and stole
our idea for Club Moist.

18:16.345 --> 18:19.473
Legally, the club reverted to me
when you got all gross.

18:19.557 --> 18:20.934
There's no such law!

18:21.017 --> 18:22.226
Pretty sure...

18:22.309 --> 18:24.144
That club was for us!

18:24.228 --> 18:27.273
It was our legacy, not just yours.

18:27.356 --> 18:29.901
This is why our friendship
could never last.

18:29.984 --> 18:32.528
You've always only thought about yourself.

18:32.612 --> 18:36.032
But soon your thoughts will be mine.

18:36.115 --> 18:37.700
[hissing]

18:37.784 --> 18:39.660
No. Not you!

18:40.036 --> 18:42.872
Hello again, Mr. King Julien,

18:42.956 --> 18:46.584
so good to see you again
[shouts] in a cave!

18:48.878 --> 18:50.546
Rob, what is this?

18:50.630 --> 18:53.424
To ensure that you never
steal from me again,

18:53.507 --> 18:58.096
I'm going to take your brain thoughts
and switch them with mine.

18:58.178 --> 19:04.184
Wow. You came back as a phantom
and now introduce a brain switching twist?

19:04.268 --> 19:08.522
Ha! That is so Rob!
[laughs]

19:08.606 --> 19:11.275
Of course, you do realize
this is going to kill us.

19:11.358 --> 19:14.570
Oh, don't be such a downer.

19:14.654 --> 19:17.615
"Dare to fail," that's my motto.

19:18.282 --> 19:19.784
[beeping]

19:21.535 --> 19:26.165
Rob, please, is it access to the club
you want? Easy.

19:26.248 --> 19:28.208
I'll get you as many twofers as you need.

19:28.292 --> 19:31.921
Keep your charity, Julie.
I just want your mind.

19:33.881 --> 19:36.425
[both scream]

19:38.552 --> 19:40.304
-[all gasp]
-King Julien!

19:42.015 --> 19:43.390
[screams]

19:46.602 --> 19:47.436
[Mort] Ow.

19:48.021 --> 19:49.772
-[groans]
-King Julien!

19:49.856 --> 19:51.315
[mumbles indistinctly]

19:51.398 --> 19:52.608
Speak to me!

19:52.984 --> 19:54.027
What's wrong with him?

19:54.152 --> 19:57.488
His mind has been transferred into Rob.

19:57.905 --> 20:00.199
My procedure worked!

20:00.282 --> 20:05.579
Oh! Even if King Julien is a mindless
vegetable, I'll never leave his side.

20:05.663 --> 20:09.083
Don't worry, King Julien,
I will water you forever!

20:09.167 --> 20:10.793
[blows raspberries, coughs]

20:10.877 --> 20:14.047
Mort! Get your fur out of my mouth!
I'm all right!

20:14.130 --> 20:15.882
Where do you think you're going, ugly?

20:16.132 --> 20:17.175
Ha!

20:17.257 --> 20:19.301
[groans]

20:19.802 --> 20:21.846
So, Rob McTodd was the Phantom.

20:21.929 --> 20:24.515
Yes, Maurice, just as I suspected.

20:24.598 --> 20:25.474
You suspected?

20:25.558 --> 20:28.519
What do you wanna do
with these two, Your Majesty?

20:28.602 --> 20:29.603
Maybe a little... Hi-yah!

20:29.687 --> 20:31.064
Or some... Kha-kha-kha!

20:31.147 --> 20:32.565
Or a little bit of... [crunching]

20:32.648 --> 20:34.233
[thumping like heartbeat]

20:36.402 --> 20:38.071
Let them go, Clover.

20:38.154 --> 20:39.155
[all] What?

20:39.238 --> 20:40.990
During the procedure...

20:41.074 --> 20:46.579
for a moment I traded minds with Rob
and felt his pain.

20:47.413 --> 20:50.583
I think it also may have been
my brain frying.

20:50.666 --> 20:55.254
Regardless, it made me see
that Rob was right.

20:55.337 --> 20:57.840
I have only thought about myself.

20:58.216 --> 21:01.094
And look what happened, people got hurt.

21:01.177 --> 21:04.513
I want my legacy to help, not hurt.

21:05.223 --> 21:09.643
That's why I've decided to close
Club Moist, the nightclub.

21:09.727 --> 21:10.853
[all gasp]

21:10.937 --> 21:14.356
And open instead Club Moist, the hospital.

21:14.440 --> 21:15.816
Huh? Great idea, right?

21:15.900 --> 21:18.694
A hospital?
Gee, how'd you come up with that?

21:18.778 --> 21:21.280
You know, I don't know.
It just came to me.

21:21.363 --> 21:24.992
It's like the gods cracked open my head
and just screamed it real loud.

21:25.076 --> 21:27.745
But, uh, King Julien,
we don't have any doctors.

21:27.828 --> 21:29.830
Ah, but we do, Clover.

21:30.414 --> 21:34.168
Me? Are you saying
that for the first time,

21:34.252 --> 21:38.464
I will legally be practicing medicine
[shouts] out of a cave?

21:40.049 --> 21:44.511
What about me, Julie?
Is there a place for me?

21:45.387 --> 21:48.099
With your expert knowledge
of plastic surgery,

21:48.182 --> 21:52.478
and obvious people skills,
how does Nurse Phantom sound?

21:52.561 --> 21:55.773
It sounds like home, old friend.

21:55.856 --> 21:56.899
Let's shake on it.

22:06.492 --> 22:09.369
Okay, Rob... I think that's good.

22:10.246 --> 22:14.583
[chuckles] And that, kids,
is how King Julien got his legacy,

22:14.667 --> 22:17.003
and the kingdom got its first hospital,

22:17.086 --> 22:20.965
proving that sometimes
there really are happy endings,

22:21.048 --> 22:23.259
which reminds me of a song.

22:23.342 --> 22:25.970

22:26.053 --> 22:27.345

and we have strict rules.

22:33.102 --> 22:37.606
