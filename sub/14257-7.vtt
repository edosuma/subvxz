01:09.509 --> 01:12.049
Hey, all you ill-guided juveniles !

01:12.050 --> 01:14.055
You're listening to
the hottest sounds around,

01:14.056 --> 01:15.559
and I do mean hot.

01:15.560 --> 01:18.401
It's 112 degrees.
Count 'em. 

01:18.402 --> 01:20.072
So here's a cool little number...

01:20.073 --> 01:24.050
The eskimos with
pass the blubber to me, bubba !

01:24.051 --> 01:25.756
Dudes.

01:25.757 --> 01:27.762
There's nothing better
to beat the heat

01:27.763 --> 01:30.101
than a steaming pizza !

01:30.102 --> 01:33.477
Michelangelo,
how can you eat hot pizza

01:33.478 --> 01:35.450
on a day like this ?

01:35.451 --> 01:36.620
Come on, April,

01:36.621 --> 01:39.662
hot pizza is always cool.

01:39.663 --> 01:42.905
Yeah, especially if it's cooked
by Wolfgang Plink.

01:42.906 --> 01:44.276
The man's a genius.

01:44.277 --> 01:45.814
The Picasso of pizza.

01:45.815 --> 01:48.120
That's why plink's is the hot place.

01:48.121 --> 01:50.493
Oh, you can say that again.

01:50.494 --> 01:52.633
The air conditioning
must be on the blink.

01:52.634 --> 01:55.976
Here comes the dude himself.

01:55.977 --> 01:58.517
You fortunate people
have the privilege

01:58.518 --> 02:02.696
of sampling my latest
Wolfgang plink creation:

02:02.697 --> 02:05.570
Tofu and the fresh shrimp.

02:05.571 --> 02:06.573
Get serious.

02:06.574 --> 02:09.348
Smells more like old socks.

02:10.720 --> 02:12.390
It has spoiled !

02:12.391 --> 02:15.098
How could such a thing happen ?

02:17.071 --> 02:18.541
Good heavens !

02:18.542 --> 02:21.716
It is completely gewerkenstinken !

02:21.717 --> 02:23.254
How can this be ?

02:23.255 --> 02:26.565
My refrigerator
was just repaired today.

02:26.566 --> 02:28.436
It's times like these

02:28.437 --> 02:30.576
that I appreciate living in a sewer.

02:30.577 --> 02:31.612
All right, here !

02:31.613 --> 02:33.451
Nobody's going nowheres

02:33.452 --> 02:36.660
till we get your money
and jewelry, that is.

02:36.661 --> 02:38.632
Money and jewelry ?

02:38.633 --> 02:40.304
Well, that lets us out.

02:40.305 --> 02:44.516
This is no joke.
It's a holdup !

02:44.517 --> 02:47.191
Hey, what are you guys
dressed up for,

02:47.192 --> 02:49.129
a trip back to Casablanca ?

02:49.130 --> 02:52.706
You like these outfits any better ?

02:57.187 --> 02:59.393
Now chill out, dude.

03:00.530 --> 03:03.237
Get those lizards !

03:03.238 --> 03:04.540
Lizards ?

03:04.541 --> 03:06.078
All right, turtles.

03:06.079 --> 03:08.853
Time to work off
some of those calories.

03:13.367 --> 03:15.137
Awesome arsenal !

03:15.138 --> 03:17.143
Dinner is served !

03:25.937 --> 03:29.613
A new wolfgang plink taste sensation...

03:29.614 --> 03:33.959
Anchovy pizza topped
with a chocolate fudge.

03:33.960 --> 03:36.132
Could I order one to go ?

03:36.133 --> 03:38.138
And so once again,

03:38.139 --> 03:39.976
the mysterious ninja turtles

03:39.977 --> 03:41.982
have protected the lives and property

03:41.983 --> 03:43.954
of the citizens of our city.

03:43.955 --> 03:46.327
This is April O'Neill, channel 6 news,

03:46.328 --> 03:49.971
reporting from what used to be plink's.

03:49.972 --> 03:51.844
Well, Burne, what did you think ?

03:51.845 --> 03:55.320
I thought it lacked
some basic ingredients.

03:55.321 --> 03:58.162
Are you talking about
the story or the pizza ?

03:58.163 --> 03:59.867
I'm sorry, April.

03:59.868 --> 04:02.207
You just didn't dig deep enough.

04:02.208 --> 04:03.611
What's the matter, April,

04:03.612 --> 04:06.352
Afraid you'd ruin your manicure ?

04:06.353 --> 04:08.726
You are wrong, mr. Thompson !

04:08.727 --> 04:10.732
That story had everything...

04:10.733 --> 04:12.403
Pathos, passion...

04:12.404 --> 04:14.208
Pepperoni.

04:14.209 --> 04:16.447
But it didn't have turtles.

04:16.449 --> 04:18.254
If you had gotten some film

04:18.255 --> 04:19.925
on these so-called heroes,

04:19.926 --> 04:21.964
that would be a story.

04:21.964 --> 04:25.474
Well, you see,
they asked me not to...

04:25.475 --> 04:28.951
In my day, we didn't make excuses.

04:28.952 --> 04:30.455
We made news.

04:30.456 --> 04:32.327
Reporters were tough back then.

04:32.328 --> 04:35.671
We'd do anything to get our story.

04:35.672 --> 04:39.013
Right. And if he weren't
so old and out of shape,

04:39.014 --> 04:40.818
he'd find out who
those turtles are in no time.

04:40.819 --> 04:43.492
Old and out

04:44.530 --> 04:45.967
what I meant was...

04:45.968 --> 04:47.504
I'll show all of you

04:47.505 --> 04:48.875
that I can get the poop

04:48.876 --> 04:50.680
on those trouble-making turtles.

04:50.681 --> 04:53.856
I don't care what slime
I have to crawl through,

04:53.857 --> 04:56.062
what maniacs I'll have to face,

04:56.063 --> 04:59.439
or what death-defying risks
I'll have to take.

04:59.440 --> 05:03.049
Boss, you're my kind of newsman.

05:03.050 --> 05:05.490
And you're coming with me.

05:05.491 --> 05:06.493
Me ?

05:06.494 --> 05:08.399
No, but I...

05:08.400 --> 05:11.708
Wait ! What story am I assigned to ?

05:11.709 --> 05:13.078
Who cares ?

05:13.079 --> 05:16.455
Do a story on why everyone's
air conditioning is broken.

05:18.695 --> 05:20.567
Well, why not ?

05:20.568 --> 05:22.639
It ought to be a hot story.

05:22.640 --> 05:24.913
You know, Irma,

05:24.914 --> 05:26.851
You might be on to something.

05:37.684 --> 05:39.856
There.
The finishing touch.

05:39.857 --> 05:43.700
Now that's what a real
news hound looks like.

05:43.701 --> 05:45.873
Are you sure you're
still up to this, boss ?

05:45.874 --> 05:47.310
Of course I am.

05:47.311 --> 05:50.854
A good reporter
Remembers everything.

05:50.855 --> 05:52.526
Uh, everything ?

05:53.998 --> 05:56.403
Well, almost everything.

05:57.875 --> 06:00.014
It's chilly
For this time of year,

06:00.015 --> 06:01.217
Wouldn't you say ?

06:01.218 --> 06:04.561
It's colder
Than a turtle's tail fin.

06:04.562 --> 06:07.569
Well, i think
It's totally cool.

06:10.913 --> 06:14.590
And also
Totally painful.

06:14.591 --> 06:16.194
It makes no sense.

06:16.195 --> 06:18.132
Why is it so c-cold
Down here

06:18.133 --> 06:20.640
And so hot up there ?

06:20.641 --> 06:22.144
Most unusual.

06:22.145 --> 06:24.752
I fear something
Is afoot.

06:24.753 --> 06:26.590
Hey, fellas,
It's april.

06:26.591 --> 06:27.928
Well,
It's about time.

06:27.929 --> 06:29.633
I've had it
With january.

06:29.634 --> 06:31.772
April--
On the turtlecom.

06:31.773 --> 06:33.277
Turtles, come in,
Please.

06:33.278 --> 06:35.115
What's up, april ?

06:35.116 --> 06:37.121
Can you meet me back
At plink's pizza

06:37.122 --> 06:38.124
In 10 minutes ?

06:38.125 --> 06:39.127
Sure thing.

06:39.128 --> 06:40.531
All right !

06:40.532 --> 06:43.840
When in doubt,
Pig out !

06:45.145 --> 06:48.153
And i found out that
Channel 6's air conditioning

06:48.154 --> 06:51.495
Was repaired by the same outfit
That fixed plink's--

06:51.496 --> 06:53.736
S & k refrigeration.

06:53.737 --> 06:55.674
They don't do
Very good work.

06:55.675 --> 06:57.079
Hunh,
That's for sure.

06:57.080 --> 06:59.853
Every unit
In a 10-block radius is out,

06:59.854 --> 07:02.527
And they've all been
Serviced by s & k.

07:02.528 --> 07:04.266
Somebody should
File a complaint.

07:04.267 --> 07:06.773
I tried, but they're not
Listed in the phone book.

07:06.774 --> 07:09.381
Hey, i saw their truck
Parked here earlier.

07:09.382 --> 07:11.286
They might still be
In the area.

07:11.287 --> 07:13.393
You fellas check out
The east side of town.

07:13.394 --> 07:14.396
I'll take the west.

07:14.397 --> 07:15.565
You got it.

07:15.566 --> 07:18.808
Turtles, let's get
Our shells in gear !

07:26.665 --> 07:28.770
Uh, boss,
Do you really think

07:28.771 --> 07:30.675
We should be in this
Neighborhood at night ?

07:30.677 --> 07:32.180
Of course.

07:32.181 --> 07:34.286
That's how i'll get
The inside dope

07:34.287 --> 07:35.790
On those turtles.

07:35.791 --> 07:37.796
This place is crawling
With informers.

07:41.308 --> 07:44.984
It's crawling
With lots of things.

07:44.985 --> 07:47.224
Will you pull
Yourself together ?

07:48.394 --> 07:50.399
There. I told you.

07:50.400 --> 07:52.672
Now to make contact
With him.

07:52.673 --> 07:56.851
I'm looking
For the giant turtles.

07:56.852 --> 07:59.692
Is the tablecloth red ?

07:59.693 --> 08:02.868
It must be some
New underworld slang.

08:02.869 --> 08:05.710
The turtles are green.

08:05.711 --> 08:07.716
That is not the password.

08:07.717 --> 08:10.056
Who are you ?
How much do you know ?

08:10.057 --> 08:11.894
Actually,
I don't know anything.

08:11.895 --> 08:13.399
He's my boss.

08:13.400 --> 08:15.138
I know even less
Than he does.

08:15.139 --> 08:17.845
We shall see.

08:23.095 --> 08:26.202
We have ways
Of making you talk.

08:34.628 --> 08:36.198
Bingo, fellas !

08:36.198 --> 08:37.802
I found
The repair truck.

08:37.803 --> 08:39.039
Corner of 4TH street
And main.

08:39.041 --> 08:40.376
I'm gonna
Check it out.

08:40.378 --> 08:41.981
Leonardo: april,

08:41.982 --> 08:44.288
Ok. I won't wait.

08:45.359 --> 08:47.063
Excuse me.

08:47.064 --> 08:48.801
I'd like to ask you
A few questions.

08:50.507 --> 08:51.777
Bebop !

08:59.867 --> 09:01.371
Don't worry, krang.

09:01.372 --> 09:04.212
The girl can do us
No further harm.

09:04.213 --> 09:06.720
She's unable
To warn the turtles.

09:06.721 --> 09:08.659
What are you doing ?

09:08.660 --> 09:12.470
And what of operation
Ice station ?

09:12.471 --> 09:13.573
Never fear.

09:13.574 --> 09:14.910
We have more freon

09:14.911 --> 09:17.383
Stolen from the city's
Air conditioning units

09:17.384 --> 09:20.559
Ready for transfer
To the technodrome.

09:20.560 --> 09:23.033
Freon ? Get real !

09:23.034 --> 09:26.911
That primitive fluorocarbon
Is too unstable.

09:26.912 --> 09:29.585
We must
Implement plan b.

09:29.586 --> 09:31.123
Plan b ?

09:31.124 --> 09:35.603
Plan b is to obtain
A supply of nutrifreeze,

09:35.604 --> 09:37.475
An experimental gas

09:37.476 --> 09:41.554
10 times more powerful
Than freon.

09:41.555 --> 09:45.498
I want you to break
Into the nutrifreeze plant

09:45.499 --> 09:47.337
And steal it.

09:47.338 --> 09:48.808
You heard him.

09:48.809 --> 09:50.813
To the nutrifreeze
Plant.

09:50.814 --> 09:52.752
Uh, right, boss.

10:01.981 --> 10:03.483
We're too late.

10:03.484 --> 10:05.021
April's gone.

10:05.022 --> 10:07.729
Wow, it looks
Like some dude

10:07.730 --> 10:09.468
Really peeled rubber.

10:09.469 --> 10:11.574
I smell freon.

10:11.575 --> 10:15.318
It must have come from
The refrigeration truck.

10:15.319 --> 10:18.594
Hey, check it out--
A trail of gas.

10:18.595 --> 10:20.065
It must be april.

10:20.066 --> 10:21.268
I bet she was captured

10:21.269 --> 10:22.605
And she leaving us
A trail.

10:22.606 --> 10:24.577
Captured ?
By whom ?

10:24.578 --> 10:27.252
By those s & k creeps,
Who else ?

10:27.253 --> 10:29.592
I wonder what s & k
Stands for ?

10:29.593 --> 10:30.595
I'm willing to bet

10:30.596 --> 10:32.735
It's not
Sensitive and kindly.

10:34.574 --> 10:36.078
No !

10:36.079 --> 10:37.816
I can't stand it.

10:37.817 --> 10:39.722
Please, no !

10:39.723 --> 10:42.831
I tell you, we don't
Know anything. Please.

10:48.648 --> 10:49.650
No !

10:49.651 --> 10:50.653
Oh, i can't
Stand it.

10:50.654 --> 10:52.860
Enough. If they
Knew anything,

10:52.861 --> 10:54.196
They'd have talked
By now.

10:54.197 --> 10:55.534
No one can withstand

10:55.535 --> 10:58.041
3 hours
Of intense tickling.

10:58.042 --> 11:01.852
See ? I told you
We didn't know anything.

11:01.853 --> 11:04.392
Unfortunately,
Now you do.

11:04.393 --> 11:08.036
It will be necessary
To liquidate you.

11:11.246 --> 11:13.085
We've been discovered.

11:13.086 --> 11:14.756
Quickly.
We must escape.

11:14.757 --> 11:17.096
We're saved ?

11:17.097 --> 11:19.035
I can't believe it.

11:19.036 --> 11:20.539
I told you, vernon.

11:20.540 --> 11:22.846
We old pros
Are survivors.

11:26.625 --> 11:28.797
The word is out
On the street

11:28.798 --> 11:30.970
That you're
Looking for me.

11:30.971 --> 11:32.306
Why, no.

11:32.307 --> 11:34.146
I'm looking for
Those darned turtles.

11:34.147 --> 11:35.582
That's me.

11:35.583 --> 11:37.087
I'm don turtelli.

11:37.088 --> 11:38.591
So who sent you ?

11:38.592 --> 11:40.764
No one sent us.
Honest.

11:40.765 --> 11:43.840
No ? I got ways
To make you talk.

11:54.806 --> 11:57.446
Oh, no. Not again.

12:05.737 --> 12:08.410
Careful
With that, you numskull.

12:08.411 --> 12:12.389
Ah, gee, i was just doing
What you told me.

12:12.390 --> 12:14.997
He never told you
To brain me.

12:14.998 --> 12:16.100
That's enough !

12:16.101 --> 12:18.741
You must handle this
Nutrifreeze carefully.

12:18.742 --> 12:20.412
It's extremely volatile.

12:20.413 --> 12:23.521
Oh, uh,
What's that mean ?

12:23.522 --> 12:26.029
Donatello: it means
Prone to explode...

12:26.030 --> 12:28.201
Just like us.

12:28.202 --> 12:31.109
The turtles !
Foot soldiers, attack !

12:33.551 --> 12:35.021
Come on, bebop.

12:35.022 --> 12:37.562
Let's soften
Them up first.

12:43.680 --> 12:45.250
Hey, dudes !

12:45.251 --> 12:48.761
If at first you
Don't succeed, um...

12:48.762 --> 12:50.599
Oh, oh, um...

12:50.600 --> 12:52.973
Try again,
You imbeciles !

12:52.974 --> 12:55.313
Oh, yeah

12:55.314 --> 12:57.787
Time to boogie, dudes.

13:02.835 --> 13:06.278
Uh-oh, i hear the patter
Of little foot soldiers.

13:06.279 --> 13:08.083
I have an idea.
Hyah !

13:12.363 --> 13:14.368
Michelangelo: whoa,
I can dig it.

13:14.369 --> 13:16.474
It's like
Roundup time.

13:16.475 --> 13:17.577
All right !

13:17.578 --> 13:20.251
The foot soldiers
Are ready for shipping

13:20.252 --> 13:22.659
Just in time
For the holidays.

13:22.660 --> 13:23.929
Stop them !

13:23.930 --> 13:26.737
Operation ice station
Must not fail !

13:26.738 --> 13:28.742
You heard the boss.

13:28.743 --> 13:30.950
Let's make turtle mush.

13:30.951 --> 13:32.855
No, you nitwits.

13:32.856 --> 13:34.760
Not with
The nutrifreeze.

13:36.098 --> 13:39.273
Time to get crunched,
Shellheads.

13:39.274 --> 13:41.045
Wrong, mutant-breath.

13:45.626 --> 13:48.399
Nuclear nose job.

13:49.971 --> 13:51.676
What's happening ?

13:51.677 --> 13:54.484
I feel like frosty
The snowturtle.

13:54.485 --> 13:56.322
It's that nutrifreeze.

13:56.323 --> 13:58.763
It froze
Michelangelo solid.

13:58.764 --> 14:00.200
What are we gonna do ?

14:00.201 --> 14:02.775
We can't leave him
Like this.

14:02.776 --> 14:04.446
Turtles !

14:04.447 --> 14:06.852
It's april !
Let's go.

14:13.573 --> 14:15.110
It's a trap.

14:15.111 --> 14:17.383
Quick. Run for it.

14:17.384 --> 14:19.657
Welcome, turtles.

14:22.098 --> 14:25.941
Too late, you
Meddling reptiles.

14:25.942 --> 14:27.880
As michelangelo
Would say,

14:27.881 --> 14:30.454
Chill out, dudes.

14:30.455 --> 14:32.460
I--i can't move.

14:32.461 --> 14:34.633
It will be a cold day

14:34.634 --> 14:36.973
When you can get
The better of me.

14:48.173 --> 14:50.345
You'll never get away
With this, shredder.

14:52.519 --> 14:54.023
Such atrocious dialogue

14:54.024 --> 14:56.529
From such a pretty face.

14:56.530 --> 14:58.870
Hurry. We must get
The nutrifreeze

14:58.871 --> 14:59.940
To the modules.

14:59.941 --> 15:03.049
Ooh, let me blast
Those turtles, boss.

15:03.050 --> 15:05.957
I love it when they
Can't fight back.

15:05.958 --> 15:07.394
Do as i say.

15:07.395 --> 15:09.400
Time is of the essence.

15:09.401 --> 15:12.576
<I>au revoir, turtles,
Till we meet again.

15:18.661 --> 15:20.431
I still
Don't understand

15:20.432 --> 15:22.437
Why did those
Mobsters let us go ?

15:22.438 --> 15:24.277
Well,
A good newsman knows

15:24.278 --> 15:27.786
When to hold
And when to fold.

15:27.787 --> 15:29.959
And when to blubber
Like a baby ?

15:29.960 --> 15:32.500
Well, it worked,
Didn't it ?

15:32.501 --> 15:34.706
Look. It's
The turtles !

15:34.707 --> 15:35.977
Vernon, this is it.

15:35.978 --> 15:38.518
The story
I've searched for.

15:38.519 --> 15:40.021
Now's my chance

15:40.022 --> 15:42.964
To expose those
Slimy, green lawbreakers

15:42.965 --> 15:44.970
For what they are.

15:44.971 --> 15:47.209
What--what's going on ?

15:47.210 --> 15:49.382
Stop ! Put us down !

15:49.383 --> 15:51.622
We're tv people.

15:59.579 --> 16:02.487
The ice--it's
Starting to melt.

16:04.359 --> 16:08.237
Oh, what happened,
Dudes ?

16:08.238 --> 16:09.908
I must've zoned out.

16:09.909 --> 16:11.413
The last thing
I remember,

16:11.414 --> 16:13.251
Shredder was headed
For the sewers.

16:13.252 --> 16:15.892
And he had april
With him.

16:15.893 --> 16:17.931
We've got
To stop shredder

16:17.932 --> 16:19.937
Before he
Puts nutrifreeze

16:19.938 --> 16:21.475
To some
Horrible use.

16:21.476 --> 16:23.113
Oh, like what ?

16:23.114 --> 16:24.617
Well, it isn't to open

16:24.618 --> 16:26.724
A chain of
Frozen yogurt stands.

16:29.632 --> 16:32.139
Rock steady,
Where did you park

16:32.140 --> 16:33.477
Those transport modules ?

16:33.478 --> 16:35.348
Let me see.

16:35.349 --> 16:37.621
Pawn ticket
For one stun laser.

16:37.622 --> 16:39.360
That ain't it.

16:39.361 --> 16:41.533
I lost the ticket, boss.

16:41.534 --> 16:43.572
Why must i be cursed

16:43.573 --> 16:45.812
With a couple of
Dipsticks like you ?

16:45.813 --> 16:48.319
Hey, boss, look.

16:48.320 --> 16:49.589
The modules.

16:50.894 --> 16:54.035
Rock steady, bebop,
Bring miss o'neill

16:54.036 --> 16:55.707
And come with me.

16:55.708 --> 16:58.415
Foot soldiers,
Operate module two.

16:58.416 --> 16:59.920
You might as well
Give up, shredder.

16:59.921 --> 17:01.423
You're through.

17:01.424 --> 17:05.535
Really. Name one person
Who can stop me.

17:05.536 --> 17:07.107
I'll name four--

17:07.108 --> 17:09.213
Cowabunga !

17:17.939 --> 17:21.281
Wow, talk about
Fighting dirty.

17:21.281 --> 17:23.888
Module two,
Fire proton rocket.

17:25.026 --> 17:26.730
A rocket !

17:26.731 --> 17:29.371
It's every turtle
For himself !

17:42.577 --> 17:44.080
Where are we ?

17:44.081 --> 17:46.153
I think
I'd rather not know.

17:57.954 --> 17:59.458
Who are you, people ?

17:59.459 --> 18:01.530
What do you want ?

18:04.239 --> 18:07.147
Oh, no.
It can't be.

18:07.148 --> 18:10.255
Zorkon gleek norkit,
Hound dog.

18:10.256 --> 18:12.696
What are you planning
To do to us ?

18:14.502 --> 18:16.675
Kitchy kitchy koo.

18:23.061 --> 18:25.031
Well, miss o'neill,

18:25.032 --> 18:27.137
I hope you're not
Counting on the turtles

18:27.138 --> 18:28.375
Saving you this time.

18:28.376 --> 18:30.648
By now,
They're nothing more

18:30.649 --> 18:32.386
Than chunks
Of turtle meat

18:32.387 --> 18:34.927
Splattered
On the sewer walls.

18:34.928 --> 18:38.872
Yeah.
Pretty gross, huh ?

18:38.873 --> 18:42.549
Shredder, you're
Fiendishly inhuman.

18:42.550 --> 18:43.919
Thank you.

18:43.920 --> 18:45.189
Please take your seats.

18:45.191 --> 18:46.895
We will be experiencing
Some turbulence.

18:46.896 --> 18:49.135
What ?

18:49.136 --> 18:51.575
Thank you for flying
Superside airline.

18:51.576 --> 18:54.818
Cowabunga,
<I>companeros !

18:54.819 --> 18:57.492
It's those
Blasted turtles !

18:57.493 --> 18:59.397
Look at us,
Fellas !

18:59.398 --> 19:00.668
Bet you can't hit us.

19:00.669 --> 19:03.342
Watch out, turtles !

19:04.613 --> 19:07.788
Way to go !
Direct hit !

19:07.789 --> 19:10.362
Ooh, we're
Slowing down, boss.

19:10.363 --> 19:12.870
What do we do now ?

19:12.871 --> 19:14.441
Prepare to eject.

19:14.442 --> 19:15.979
A word of advice--

19:15.980 --> 19:18.520
When this module
Crashes,

19:18.521 --> 19:20.458
Try not to go
All to pieces.

19:25.641 --> 19:28.481
Those creeps.
They've left april.

19:28.482 --> 19:30.989
Uh, isn't that
What we wanted ?

19:30.990 --> 19:32.192
Not if she's inside

19:32.193 --> 19:35.167
When the nutrifreeze
Goes boom.

19:35.168 --> 19:36.539
Not to worry.

19:36.540 --> 19:38.210
It would take
A tremendous impact

19:38.211 --> 19:40.015
To cause that.

19:40.016 --> 19:45.831
Will that do ?

19:45.832 --> 19:48.339
Hang on, april.

19:48.340 --> 19:51.314
We're going to make
Turtle tracks.

19:59.171 --> 20:01.176
That nutty nutrifreeze.

20:15.351 --> 20:16.788
How unbelievable.

20:16.789 --> 20:18.125
I could've sworn

20:18.126 --> 20:19.796
We were beamed aboard
That spaceship

20:19.797 --> 20:21.034
Only an hour ago.

20:21.035 --> 20:22.571
But it was summertime.

20:22.572 --> 20:25.045
We must've been
Gone for months.

20:25.046 --> 20:29.525
Vernon, i'm about to file
The story of the century.

20:31.264 --> 20:32.701
Well, Shredder,

20:32.702 --> 20:34.973
Thanks to

20:34.974 --> 20:38.818
operation ice station is a failure.

20:38.819 --> 20:39.754
Failure ?

20:39.755 --> 20:44.100
D the place off, haven't we ?

20:45.438 --> 20:48.212
Can we take a break now, boss ?

20:48.213 --> 20:50.451
Oh, shut up and keep running.

20:55.266 --> 20:56.636
But, mr. Thompson,

20:56.637 --> 20:59.745
are you sure you want
to reveal this story ?

20:59.746 --> 21:00.748
Do I ?

21:00.749 --> 21:02.586
Just stand aside and watch

21:02.587 --> 21:06.965
how a real reporter digs up the facts.

21:07.969 --> 21:10.977
This is Burne Thompson
with the news.

21:10.978 --> 21:13.652
In the tradition of responsible 
reporting

21:13.653 --> 21:16.494
that is the Hallmark
of channel 6 news,

21:16.495 --> 21:19.000
Here is tonight's top story.

21:19.001 --> 21:22.344
Elvis clones from mars invade earth !

21:23.682 --> 21:24.851
Really, mr. Thompson,

21:24.852 --> 21:26.522
You must get a grip on yourself.

21:26.523 --> 21:28.863
Yeah. Get real.

21:28.864 --> 21:30.534
But's it's true,

21:30.535 --> 21:31.872
every word of it.

21:31.873 --> 21:33.375
Keep watching the skies,

21:33.376 --> 21:36.049
and don't trust anyone with sideburns !

21:39.059 --> 21:40.563
Who says

21:40.564 --> 21:43.004
there's nothing funny on television ?
