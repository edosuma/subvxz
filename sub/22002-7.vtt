Tommy Gobbler's back
and he wants to hear

00:05.423 --> 00:07.757
what you turkeys are thankful for.

00:07.792 --> 00:09.474
- Charles, you gotta stop.
- Nah.

00:09.510 --> 00:11.084
I don't gobble understand people.

00:11.120 --> 00:12.152
- But, Charles...
- Gobble.

00:12.188 --> 00:13.247
- Dude.
- Gobble.

00:13.283 --> 00:15.667
Gobble, gobble, your tail feather
is caught in the gobble door.

00:15.703 --> 00:17.408
Thank you. Gobble... wait, what?

All right, you know the drill.

00:48.176 --> 00:50.299
We've been living and breathing
this operation for years.

00:50.335 --> 00:52.735
It goes down today
and we only get one shot.

00:52.771 --> 00:56.048
Thanksgiving 2017,
the meeting of the parents.

00:56.084 --> 00:58.318
Our objective is clear.
Our parents will laugh,

00:58.354 --> 01:01.122
they will bond, and then
when the time is right,

01:01.158 --> 01:02.912
our fathers will share a hug good-bye

01:02.947 --> 01:05.322
and it will be weird,
but in the good way.

01:05.358 --> 01:07.216
Oh, my God. What is that photo?

01:07.252 --> 01:08.851
I did an image search for dad's hugging.

01:08.887 --> 01:10.486
I didn't have a lot of time
to put this board together.

01:10.522 --> 01:12.887
Now then, let's review
our targets, shall we?

01:12.923 --> 01:14.891
First we have the Santiagos:
Camila and Victor.

01:14.926 --> 01:16.392
They are traditional, reserved,

01:16.428 --> 01:17.860
and like their daughter, controlling.

01:17.896 --> 01:19.429
I wouldn't say I'm controlling.

01:19.464 --> 01:20.753
I would say I'm Type A.

01:20.789 --> 01:22.523
You should write Type A there
instead of controlling.

01:22.559 --> 01:24.033
Vivid example of what we're up against.

01:24.069 --> 01:25.968
Now then, on the other side,
we have the Peraltas:

01:26.004 --> 01:29.148
Karen and Roger. They are
perfectly normal, no known flaws.

01:29.546 --> 01:31.708
All right, fine.
My dad's a selfish drunken slut

01:31.743 --> 01:34.059
- and my mom's a flighty weirdo.
- This is gonna be a disaster.

01:34.095 --> 01:37.447
I knew you'd say that,
which is why we have this.

01:37.482 --> 01:38.948
A list of things they have in common.

01:38.983 --> 01:40.583
We can use it to grease
the conversation.

01:40.618 --> 01:42.985
Ooh, convo grease.

01:43.021 --> 01:44.630
This is perfect.

01:44.666 --> 01:47.356
Okay, our dads both golf.
Our mom's both paint.

01:47.392 --> 01:49.292
All four of them have hair.

01:49.327 --> 01:50.526
Yeah, but that's
bottom of the barrel stuff.

01:50.562 --> 01:51.961
We're not gonna have to use that.

01:51.996 --> 01:53.730
Oh, you did a lot of work on this.

01:53.765 --> 01:55.732
- I'm really impressed.
- Oh, well, you know,

01:55.767 --> 01:58.000
it's really important to me.
I feel like it's a chance

01:58.036 --> 01:59.969
for me to finally have
the big family Thanksgiving

02:00.004 --> 02:02.205
- I never got as a kid.
- Oh, babe.

02:02.240 --> 02:03.539
It's gonna be amazing.

02:07.345 --> 02:08.877
Are you erasing the word
controlling behind my back

02:08.913 --> 02:11.347
- while we kiss?
- Mm-hmm.

02:11.382 --> 02:13.649
We can keep it in my office
until it's time to leave.

02:13.685 --> 02:15.418
What do you have in the
pastry box, sir? Brownies?

02:15.453 --> 02:16.910
No, you hold brownies from the side.

02:16.946 --> 02:18.145
He's holding it from the bottom.

02:18.181 --> 02:19.689
True. Maybe it s a cheesecake.

02:19.724 --> 02:21.557
But there's no condensation on the box.

02:21.593 --> 02:23.326
- It's room temperature.
- Look at the finger spread,

02:23.361 --> 02:24.660
tensing in the shoulders.

02:24.696 --> 02:26.863
He's supporting something dense.

02:27.298 --> 02:29.499
- [together] It's a pie.
- It is a pie.

02:29.534 --> 02:32.635
- Damn, that was impressive.
- But this is not just any pie.

02:32.670 --> 02:34.637
It's an English walnut pie
from the Cottage Inn

02:34.672 --> 02:36.572
- in Saratoga Springs.
- Raymond and I drive

02:36.608 --> 02:38.274

02:38.309 --> 02:39.575
It's the finest sweet treat on earth.

02:39.611 --> 02:41.277
Even better than a plain scone.

02:41.312 --> 02:42.529
Wow, that good, huh?

02:42.565 --> 02:44.465
We're bringing it to Kevin's
parents' house tonight.

02:44.883 --> 02:47.583
Can't wait. What do you all
have planned for Turkey day?

02:47.619 --> 02:50.186
Well, I've got a great
Thanksgiving planned.

02:50.222 --> 02:52.354
Nikolaj has taken to food
just like his papa,

02:52.390 --> 02:54.690
so I'm making an exotic spread.

02:54.726 --> 02:57.360
If it can fly or swim,
we're eating its eggs.

02:57.395 --> 02:59.629
Well, at the Jefford's house,
it's not just Thanksgiving,

02:59.664 --> 03:02.565
it's also Ava's birthday,
so we do it up huge.

03:02.600 --> 03:04.267
I got her a Perry the Parrot.

03:05.002 --> 03:07.469
That's a hot toy.
Terry tried ten toy stores.

03:07.505 --> 03:09.305

- Thank you.

03:15.947 --> 03:17.947
Well, everyone's plans seem lovely.

03:17.982 --> 03:19.582
Oh, Hitchcock and I didn't say ours.

03:24.956 --> 03:26.522
What is this pitcher of gray water?

03:26.558 --> 03:29.625
I read an article that said
when you wash vegetables,

03:29.661 --> 03:31.694
all the nutrients leech into the water

03:31.729 --> 03:34.864
and then you can drink it.
They call it a super water.

03:34.899 --> 03:36.699
Oh. Well, that's neat.

03:36.734 --> 03:38.901
I am gonna just hide it right over here.

03:38.937 --> 03:40.336
Dad, you almost ready?

03:40.371 --> 03:41.950
The Santiago's are very punctual?

03:41.986 --> 03:43.919
I'm already out of the shower.

03:43.955 --> 03:45.508
- Chill, bro.
- Don't call me bro.

03:45.543 --> 03:47.276
- I'm your son.
- Okay, dude.

03:47.312 --> 03:48.911
- Dude is not an improvement.
- [doorbell rings]

03:48.947 --> 03:50.780
- Oh, boy, they're here.
- Oh, now, honey,

03:50.815 --> 03:53.416
I know you're nervous,
but it's gonna be fine.

03:53.451 --> 03:54.917
We can handle ourselves.

03:54.953 --> 03:57.887
Hola. Feliz Thanksgiving.

03:57.922 --> 03:59.789
Jake told me you were Cuban.

03:59.824 --> 04:01.591
Yes, I did, and I regret it. Come on in.

04:01.626 --> 04:03.926
So nice to finally meet you. I'm Victor.

04:03.962 --> 04:05.962
- And I'm Camila.
- Oh.

04:05.997 --> 04:07.930
- And you brought a turkey?
- Sure did.

04:07.966 --> 04:09.699
Even though I told her that
you were making the turkey,

04:09.734 --> 04:11.567
and all she needed to
bring was stuffing.

04:11.603 --> 04:14.437
The stuffing's inside it and
now we have two turkeys,

04:14.472 --> 04:16.906
- just in case.
- In case of what?

04:16.940 --> 04:18.774
I don't know. [laughs awkwardly]

04:18.810 --> 04:20.776
Anyway, it was in the car
when she picked me up.

04:20.812 --> 04:22.778
- Isn't that fun?
- The most fun.

04:22.814 --> 04:24.347
Why don't we just get comfortable.

04:24.382 --> 04:26.382
- My dad is just...
- Hey, Kare-bear,

04:26.417 --> 04:27.817
- which pants do you think...
- Dad!

04:27.852 --> 04:30.686
- Honey.
- The Santiagos are here.

04:30.722 --> 04:33.812
Feliz Thanksgiving. How was the trip in?

04:33.848 --> 04:35.157
The flight must have been awful.

04:35.193 --> 04:36.692
- Hey, Dad?
- This holiday is the worst.

04:36.728 --> 04:38.394
Could we just press pause on
that and maybe get some pants?

04:38.429 --> 04:40.229
Fine. I'll put on some pants.

04:40.265 --> 04:41.487
Thanks.

04:42.087 --> 04:44.299
Squad, bullpen, now.

04:44.335 --> 04:46.302
- Is everything okay, sir?
- No, it is not.

04:46.337 --> 04:48.272
I went to a meeting and when I returned,

04:48.308 --> 04:50.573
my pie was gone.
Which one of you took it?

04:50.608 --> 04:52.808
Calm down, there's no
need to point fingers.

04:53.050 --> 04:55.225
At us. It was clearly
Hitchcock and Scully.

04:55.261 --> 04:57.203
How dare you. You have no proof.

04:57.239 --> 04:58.719
There's crumbs all over your desks.

04:58.755 --> 05:00.449
Well, these aren't pie crumbs.

05:00.485 --> 05:03.185
Bread, cookie, pizza, sandwich, blintz,

05:03.221 --> 05:05.655
and one good old fashioned potato chip.

05:06.477 --> 05:08.911
No pie here. I just humiliated you.

05:08.947 --> 05:10.647
Look, this doesn't have
to be a big deal.

05:10.683 --> 05:12.295
Whoever took that pie, come forward

05:12.330 --> 05:13.992
and all will be forgiven.

05:15.400 --> 05:17.566
Smart. You knew
I would never forgive you.

05:17.602 --> 05:20.536
But you're dumb if you think
I won't get to the bottom of this.

05:20.571 --> 05:23.339
Everyone here is a suspect.

05:23.374 --> 05:24.740
Okay, not off to a great start.

05:24.776 --> 05:26.509
My mom brought
a passive-aggressive turkey

05:26.544 --> 05:28.210
and we all saw your dad's penis
through his undies.

05:28.246 --> 05:29.902
What? You did? Why were you looking?

05:29.938 --> 05:31.954
No, I wasn't. It all happened so fast.

05:31.990 --> 05:34.517
Hey, everyone, I'm sorry
for not being "dressed."

05:34.552 --> 05:36.719
I didn't think you guys
were gonna be so early.

05:36.754 --> 05:38.517
We arrived at the agreed upon time.

05:38.553 --> 05:40.881
Right. So, like, super early.

Convo grease them right now.

05:42.493 --> 05:43.993
Yes. Mrs. Peralta,

05:44.028 --> 05:47.330
I love this new ceramic
that you painted.

05:47.365 --> 05:48.731
You know, my mom paints as well.

05:48.766 --> 05:50.333
- Really?
- Yes.

05:50.368 --> 05:52.468
- I paint on canvases though.
- Oh.

05:52.503 --> 05:54.337
- And that's different?
- Very.

05:54.372 --> 05:56.238
- Completely.
- I just always found canvas

05:56.274 --> 05:57.640
to be too restricting.

05:57.675 --> 06:01.377
For me with bowls
and vases and furniture,

06:01.412 --> 06:02.812
the world is my canvas.

06:02.847 --> 06:05.448
Yes, and for me, with canvas,

06:05.483 --> 06:07.416
the canvas is my canvas.

06:07.452 --> 06:09.919
- She said "canvas" so much.
- Who wants to hear a joke?

06:09.954 --> 06:11.854
Do you mean like a riddle?
'Cause I love riddles.

06:11.889 --> 06:15.155
No, I mean like a joke joke,
where I say it and you laugh.

06:15.191 --> 06:16.290
No, then I'm not interested.

06:16.326 --> 06:18.694
Oh. Well... golf.

06:18.730 --> 06:21.630
Yes, golf. Anyone hit the links lately?

06:21.666 --> 06:23.555
- I don't play golf.
- What are you talking about?

06:23.591 --> 06:24.967
You played it all the time
when I was a kid.

06:25.003 --> 06:27.536
- Never played golf in my life.
- Jake, your remembering

06:27.572 --> 06:29.305
when he used to pretend to golf

06:29.340 --> 06:31.374
so that he could spend his
Sunday's cheating on me.

06:31.409 --> 06:33.509
- Ah.
- Oh, yeah.

06:33.544 --> 06:35.311
- Oops.
- But it's okay now.

06:35.346 --> 06:36.979
We're happy, we're back together...

06:37.015 --> 06:38.514
- We're cool.
- And, you know,

06:38.549 --> 06:40.383
all relationships have rough patches.

06:40.418 --> 06:42.300
- Right, Camila?
- No.

06:43.488 --> 06:45.808
- Jake.
- Hair.

06:46.537 --> 06:49.425
We all have hair.

06:49.460 --> 06:50.493
Mm.

06:51.719 --> 06:52.753
Okay, this is bad.

06:52.789 --> 06:54.038
None of the convo grease worked.

06:54.073 --> 06:55.973
We need a new plan.
There's gotta be some way

06:56.008 --> 06:57.641
- to make them get along.
- Maybe we could play a game.

06:57.677 --> 07:00.399
No. No games.
My dad gets super competitive.

07:00.435 --> 07:03.214
He used to flip out on me
when I beat him at Adult Clue.

07:03.250 --> 07:05.118
It was the only board game
he had at his condo.

07:05.154 --> 07:06.633
All the murder weapons were sex toys.

07:06.669 --> 07:08.099
Oh, okay. You know what?

07:08.135 --> 07:10.213
Actually, my dad is super
competitive too.

07:10.249 --> 07:13.067
It's bad. He got kicked off
a bird watching tour once.

07:13.103 --> 07:15.217
- Look a kingfisher.
- No, no, no, no, no.

07:15.253 --> 07:17.249
That's the same bird I saw earlier.

07:17.285 --> 07:18.525
That doesn't count.

07:18.866 --> 07:22.432
Yikes. All right, so it's agreed.
We steer clear of all competition.

07:22.468 --> 07:23.953
Why can't there be some magic potion

07:23.989 --> 07:26.439
that makes everyone happy
and have fun all the time??

07:27.993 --> 07:30.336
Who wants some alcohol?

07:30.781 --> 07:32.575
- [camera clicks]
- Thank you very much, David.

07:32.611 --> 07:33.668
That'll be all.

07:36.014 --> 07:38.208
There are no prints on the box,
no DNA evidence,

07:38.244 --> 07:40.433
and the security camera
in my office was obscured,

07:40.468 --> 07:42.135
which means whoever took my pie

07:42.170 --> 07:43.736
thought it through. And that means...

07:43.772 --> 07:45.004
It wasn't Hitchcock and Scully.

07:45.039 --> 07:46.038
Exactly.

07:46.074 --> 07:48.074
Now, as for you three,

07:48.109 --> 07:50.076
I think it's time we had a little chat.

07:50.111 --> 07:51.677
How long you been planning this?

07:51.713 --> 07:54.013
A day? A week? A year?

07:54.048 --> 07:56.449
Or is this the only reason you
joined the force to begin with?

07:56.484 --> 07:59.585
So you think I became a cop
just so I can steal your pie?

07:59.621 --> 08:01.988
Your words not mine.

08:02.023 --> 08:03.256
No, don't tell me why you did it.

08:03.291 --> 08:05.525
- Tell him.
- You want me to talk to

08:05.560 --> 08:07.460
this picture of your husband?

08:07.495 --> 08:09.562
Look him in the eye
and tell him what you did.

08:09.597 --> 08:12.398
- I didn't do it, Kevin.
- Don't you say his name.

08:12.433 --> 08:13.966
No, Terry, I'm not mad at you.

08:14.002 --> 08:15.168
I know you didn't mean to do it.

08:15.203 --> 08:17.003
You just got hungry,

08:17.038 --> 08:18.471
and that's the most
natural thing in the world.

08:18.506 --> 08:21.240
- I didn't take your pie.
- You're lying!

08:21.276 --> 08:23.176
If you're so innocent, where were you

08:23.211 --> 08:25.144
- when the pie went missing?
- I was at the grocery store

08:25.180 --> 08:26.979
buying goose feet for Nikolaj's dinner.

08:27.015 --> 08:28.948
I was getting the oil
changed in my bike.

08:28.983 --> 08:30.550
Preparing for my solo Thanksgiving ride.

08:30.585 --> 08:31.817
I was at the gym.

08:31.853 --> 08:35.421
Ava's birthday/Thanksgiving
dinner's a high-caloric affair.

08:35.456 --> 08:37.155
Terry needs to earn that feast.

08:37.192 --> 08:40.326
Everybody has an alibi. How convenient.

08:40.361 --> 08:44.163
So I hope you're comfortable
because I will keep you in here

08:44.198 --> 08:46.599
- all day if necessary!
- [knocks on door]

08:46.634 --> 08:48.334
We need the room to question someone

08:48.369 --> 08:50.102
- about the Red Hook homicide.
- Oh, no problem.

08:50.138 --> 08:53.439
- We'll be right out.
- Okay, we are one glass in.

08:53.474 --> 08:55.208
My mom's telling a story about my birth

08:55.243 --> 08:57.243
and your parents are not recoiling.

08:57.278 --> 08:59.746
Good. Let's keep it going.
I think we need to top 'em off.

08:59.981 --> 09:01.214
A-top them off.

09:01.249 --> 09:03.082
Every night I'm told what to do

09:03.117 --> 09:04.984
and every morning I do what I'm told,

09:05.019 --> 09:07.220
but yet I cannot escape your scold.

09:07.255 --> 09:10.089
What am I? An alarm clock.

09:10.124 --> 09:13.392
Oh, I get it. So a riddle
is just like a fact

09:13.428 --> 09:15.094
that's told in a really confusing way.

09:15.129 --> 09:17.496
- Exactly.
- Hey, I used to fly

09:17.532 --> 09:20.399
- with Sully Sullenberger.
- What he did was amazing.

09:20.435 --> 09:23.069
Between us, I could have landed
that plane on the ground

09:23.104 --> 09:25.972
at the destination without
killing any of those birds.

09:26.007 --> 09:27.607
[laughter]

09:27.642 --> 09:29.675
- [scatting]
- Is my dad playing piano?

09:29.711 --> 09:31.344
And is my dad scatting?

09:31.379 --> 09:33.546
[scatting continues]

09:33.581 --> 09:35.114
- This is amazing.
- Oh, my.

09:35.149 --> 09:36.682
Who wants more wine?

09:36.718 --> 09:38.451
No, no, no, no, no more for me.

09:38.487 --> 09:40.671
In fact, I think everyone here
has had enough.

09:40.707 --> 09:42.121
- We have?
- Yes.

09:42.156 --> 09:44.891
- [paper crinkling]
- Now we're drinking this.

09:45.460 --> 09:47.159
Rum from Cuba.

09:47.195 --> 09:50.229
- [cheers and applause]
- Rum from Cuba!

09:50.265 --> 09:52.064
I saw what you did this morning

09:52.100 --> 09:54.133
when you deduced the
contents of my bakery box.

09:54.168 --> 09:56.636
Impressive.
Now I need to use your skills

09:56.671 --> 09:58.304
to find my pie.

09:58.339 --> 09:59.972
It's about time you came to us.

10:00.008 --> 10:02.285
Here's what we need from you.
A list of the pie's ingredients.

10:02.321 --> 10:03.843
We're looking for anything
that might linger

10:03.879 --> 10:06.060
- on someone's breath.
- We need surveillance footage

10:06.096 --> 10:08.489
from the water fountain,
the crumb consistency was dry.

10:08.525 --> 10:09.786
Whoever ate it's gonna be thirsty.

10:09.822 --> 10:11.450
Now what kind of crimped edge
are we dealing with here?

10:11.486 --> 10:13.486
- U-shaped or V?
- I don't know.

10:13.521 --> 10:15.388
Well, then get on the damned phone

10:15.423 --> 10:17.199
and find out.

10:18.393 --> 10:19.692
[laughter]

10:19.727 --> 10:21.661
Babe, our parents are vibing hard.

10:21.696 --> 10:24.315
Drinking just makes people
get along better.

10:24.351 --> 10:26.406
Do you think if I got my parents drunk
every day when I was a kid

10:26.442 --> 10:28.234
they would have stayed together
and we would have had a happy family?

10:28.269 --> 10:30.002
- Probably. Yeah.
- Right. Yeah.

10:30.038 --> 10:31.972
- [chimes glass]
- I'd like to say a few words.

10:32.008 --> 10:35.560
Camila and I thrilled to
welcome you into our family,

10:35.596 --> 10:39.578
so allow me to be the first to
bless this union with a toast.

10:39.614 --> 10:42.615
- To Jake and Amy.
- ALL: To Jake and Amy.

10:42.650 --> 10:44.383
Aww, thanks, Dad. That was really sweet.

10:44.419 --> 10:46.352
- I have a toast too.
- Oh.

10:46.387 --> 10:50.156
Karen and I would like
to welcome you into our family.

10:50.191 --> 10:54.360
And allow me to be the first
to say that we love you.

10:54.395 --> 10:56.228
To Jake and Amy. Congratulations.

10:56.264 --> 10:57.697
ALL: To Jake and Amy.

10:57.732 --> 10:59.265
- Thanks, Dad.
- I'd like to go again.

10:59.300 --> 11:00.666
Uh-oh, they're getting competitive.

11:00.702 --> 11:02.435
It goes without saying, I love you both.

11:02.470 --> 11:04.971
- But you didn't say it.
- I'd just like to add,

11:05.006 --> 11:06.973
if there's anything you ever need,

11:07.008 --> 11:08.708
the Santiago's are here for you.

11:08.776 --> 11:10.643
- To Jake and Amy.
- Round two.

11:10.678 --> 11:12.378
Oh, that seems like plenty, Dad.

11:12.413 --> 11:13.546
No, if Victor gets two toasts,

11:13.581 --> 11:15.348
- then I do too.
- [sighs]

11:15.383 --> 11:17.483
I would like to go one
step further and say that

11:17.518 --> 11:21.087
if there is anything
that you need or want

11:21.522 --> 11:23.255
the Peralta's are there for you.

11:23.291 --> 11:24.991
That doesn't sound like
a better offer than mine.

11:25.059 --> 11:26.525
Yeah, it is.

11:26.561 --> 11:28.060
[stammers] It's a lot better than yours.

11:28.096 --> 11:29.190
Jake...

11:30.232 --> 11:32.331
I'll give you my grandfather's watch.

11:32.367 --> 11:34.000
You are now a Santiago.

11:34.035 --> 11:35.534
I would like to pay for the wedding.

11:35.570 --> 11:37.203
Amy, you are now my daughter.

11:37.238 --> 11:38.604
- ALL: What?
- I win.

11:38.639 --> 11:40.272
To Jake and Amy.

11:40.308 --> 11:42.641
Oh, no. There are downsides to alcohol.

11:43.805 --> 11:46.801
Well, that was
a lovely series of toasts,

11:46.837 --> 11:49.004
Now who can I interest
in 12 cups of coffee?

11:49.039 --> 11:51.397
No, I'd like to know what Roger meant

11:51.433 --> 11:52.807
when he said he would pay
for the wedding.

11:52.843 --> 11:54.413
How much are you willing to give them?

11:54.449 --> 11:56.382
- Whatever they need.
- You know it's tradition

11:56.418 --> 11:58.246
- for the bride's family to pay.
- It's also tradition

11:58.281 --> 11:59.748
for the host to make the turkey.

11:59.783 --> 12:01.850
- Okay, guys...
- Bottom line is,

12:01.885 --> 12:03.952
we appreciate the offer,
but we're paying.

12:03.987 --> 12:06.321
No, you gave him the watch.
That was your gift.

12:06.356 --> 12:08.074
Maybe we should just split the wedding.

12:08.110 --> 12:09.476
It's a great idea, Mom.

12:09.512 --> 12:11.259
Given your financial situation.

12:11.294 --> 12:13.161
- No.
- What's that supposed to mean?

12:13.196 --> 12:15.096
Our financial "situation"?

12:15.132 --> 12:16.898
You know, I think we probably all had

12:16.933 --> 12:18.867
just about enough of this delicious rum.

12:18.902 --> 12:20.235
I'm gonna dump it out into this plant.

12:20.270 --> 12:21.936
- [gasps]
- That's a $600 bottle.

12:21.972 --> 12:24.606
$527. I looked it up online.

12:24.641 --> 12:27.842
If you paid $600, you're making
some bad choices, my friend.

12:27.878 --> 12:31.880
All right, it's dinner time.
Everybody go wash your hands.

12:31.915 --> 12:33.848
I'd never said that before.
Amy, you come with me.

12:33.884 --> 12:35.650
[exhales sharply] This is a nightmare.

12:35.686 --> 12:37.652
This is worse than
my sixth birthday party

12:37.688 --> 12:39.320
when I caught my dad making out
with a female clown

12:39.356 --> 12:41.322
in the bounce house.
Oh, my dad is the worst.

12:41.358 --> 12:43.224
I know. He's ruining the whole day.

12:43.260 --> 12:45.244
[sighs] Yeah, but, you know,

12:45.533 --> 12:47.562
don't just blame my dad.

12:47.597 --> 12:48.897
You literally just said he's the worst.

12:48.932 --> 12:50.353
I know. It's okay when I say it.

12:50.389 --> 12:52.098
You have to pretend like he's cool.
Those are the rules.

12:52.134 --> 12:53.127
Plus, you gotta admit,

12:53.163 --> 12:55.303
your parents were being
a little condescending.

12:55.338 --> 12:57.205
Why? Because they asked
what was in the dip

12:57.240 --> 12:59.207
- that seemed to be just mayo?
- All dip is just mayo.

12:59.242 --> 13:01.676
Yes, but no, what I was
referring to was the fact that

13:01.712 --> 13:03.712
your mom brought her own hand towels.

13:03.747 --> 13:05.180
As if my mom wouldn't
have washed hers knowing

13:05.215 --> 13:06.881
- they had guests coming over?
- Did she?

13:06.917 --> 13:08.616
No, you don't have to.

13:08.652 --> 13:09.918
They're only touched
by freshly cleaned hands.

13:09.953 --> 13:11.352
- They never get dirty.
- Wow.

13:11.388 --> 13:12.821
The unhygienic apple doesn't fall far

13:12.856 --> 13:14.222
from the unhygienic tree.

13:14.257 --> 13:15.690
Did you just call my mom a tree?

13:15.726 --> 13:16.925
I called her an unhygienic tree.

13:16.960 --> 13:18.644
Wow. Wow.

13:19.196 --> 13:21.019
All right, you know what?

13:21.765 --> 13:23.131
Let's just go back in there

13:23.166 --> 13:25.066
and enjoy our joyous Thanksgiving

13:25.102 --> 13:27.569
and hopefully no one's
parents will ruin it.

13:27.604 --> 13:29.070
Fine. Well, I know that my parents

13:29.106 --> 13:30.672
aren't gonna ruin any joyousness.

13:30.707 --> 13:32.273
In fact, they're gonna be
joyous as hell.

13:32.309 --> 13:34.816
Not nearly as joyous as my parents.

13:36.046 --> 13:37.178
<i>Thank you, all, for joining me.</i>

13:37.214 --> 13:38.613
I checked into your alibis.

13:38.648 --> 13:40.115
Or should I say...

13:40.150 --> 13:41.916
alib-lies!

13:41.952 --> 13:43.985
Diaz, if you were changing
the oil in your bike

13:44.020 --> 13:45.987
for your big ride up the coast,
then tell me,

13:46.022 --> 13:48.556
why is your tank only half full?

13:48.592 --> 13:51.259
- You dipsticked my bike?
- That's not all I dipsticked.

13:51.294 --> 13:53.728
Mr. Fit, or should I call you
by your real name?

13:53.764 --> 13:56.197
Mr. Fib. I find it quite odd

13:56.233 --> 13:57.899
that you were building up
an appetite at the gym

13:57.934 --> 14:00.802
when your gym is closed on Thanksgiving.

14:00.837 --> 14:02.804
And, Boyle, out buying goose feet

14:02.839 --> 14:04.205
- for Nickolaj?
- Nikolaj.

14:04.241 --> 14:06.207
I found your grocery store receipt.

14:06.243 --> 14:08.977
No feet of any kind.
But there was one purchase,

14:09.012 --> 14:11.880
a beverage that pairs
perfectly with pie.

14:11.915 --> 14:14.249
One gallon of milk!

14:14.284 --> 14:16.017
This heist took three people.

14:16.052 --> 14:19.320
Lady Dipstick, Mr. Fib,
and the Milk Man.

14:19.356 --> 14:22.624
The jig is up. Confess.

14:22.952 --> 14:24.317
- Okay, I lied.
- Thank you.

14:24.353 --> 14:25.894
Not about the pie.
About my Thanksgiving.

14:25.929 --> 14:28.029
I'm not spending it alone.
I'm spending it with my family.

14:28.064 --> 14:30.245
We're seeing the new
"Minions" musical on Broadway.

14:30.600 --> 14:32.834
And I wasn't putting oil in my bike.

14:32.869 --> 14:35.770
I was picking up these matching
T-shirts for my whole family.

14:35.806 --> 14:37.572
- [gasps]
- I missed my family a lot

14:37.607 --> 14:39.500
when I was in prison and we've
gotten really close again.

14:39.536 --> 14:41.402
I was embarrassed about
how pumped I am to see them.

14:41.438 --> 14:43.077
The T-shirts were my idea.

14:43.419 --> 14:45.853
Okay. It was a two-man job.

14:45.889 --> 14:47.822
No, I didn't steal your pie either.

14:47.858 --> 14:50.652
I lied about the gym because
I was still trying to find

14:50.687 --> 14:52.486
a Perry the Parrot for Ava.

14:52.522 --> 14:54.155
I forgot it was her birthday coming up

14:54.191 --> 14:57.495
and by the time I realized,
the dumb toy was all sold out.

14:57.727 --> 14:59.694
I just didn't want you guys to know

14:59.729 --> 15:01.896
what a horrible dad I really am.

15:01.932 --> 15:03.731
Well, now we do. Boyle?

15:03.767 --> 15:05.680
[crying] Nikolaj is a picky eater!

15:05.716 --> 15:08.970
I lied about his pallet.
All he drinks is milk.

15:09.005 --> 15:11.539
All he eats is buttered noodles.

15:11.575 --> 15:13.641
- And perhaps my walnut pie?
- I wish.

15:13.677 --> 15:17.111
He hates nuts. My son is a basic bitch.

15:17.512 --> 15:19.212
So none of you took my pie.

15:19.248 --> 15:21.316
Captain, you're gonna wanna see this.

15:21.351 --> 15:23.151
Their desks were clean,

15:23.186 --> 15:25.787
so we expanded the search radius.

15:25.822 --> 15:27.088
Take a look.

15:27.123 --> 15:29.023
My pie, and it wasn't even eaten.

15:29.059 --> 15:31.960
Just thrown away
like common street trash.

15:31.995 --> 15:34.696
Makes me sick.
Spend your life on the force,

15:34.731 --> 15:36.564
and it never gets easier.

15:36.770 --> 15:39.067
Wow, Mom, what a delightful dinner.

15:39.102 --> 15:40.902
I mean, these have gotta be
the most joyous green beans

15:40.937 --> 15:43.605
- I've ever seen.
- Oh, thanks, honey.

15:43.640 --> 15:45.607
- They're pre-made from a can.
- Great.

15:45.675 --> 15:47.709
Shall we carve the turkey?
Get this dinner started?

15:47.744 --> 15:50.543
I'm an excellent carver. Allow me.

15:50.579 --> 15:51.649
I think I can carve the turkey.

15:51.685 --> 15:52.984
After all, it is my house

15:53.020 --> 15:54.682
and sitting right here in front of me.

15:54.718 --> 15:56.517
We have two turkeys.

15:56.553 --> 15:59.187
- You can both carve one.
- Yes, thank goodness

15:59.222 --> 16:01.956
for the second turkey, a very
normal thing to have brought.

16:01.992 --> 16:04.592
This is actually very good
because now everybody could see

16:04.628 --> 16:07.120
- who cuts the turkey better.
- You're on.

16:07.731 --> 16:09.864
- Wow. Really mature.
- You're just saying that

16:09.900 --> 16:11.314
because you know my dad's gonna win.

16:11.350 --> 16:13.217
- As if.
- Hey, Roger,

16:13.253 --> 16:15.096
You like jokes. Here's one.

16:15.132 --> 16:17.135
I'd hate to be a passenger
on one of your flights

16:17.171 --> 16:19.063
if you fly as slow as you cut a turkey.

16:19.099 --> 16:21.657
Riddle me this, Victor.
Who sucks at carving turkey,

16:21.693 --> 16:23.537
thinks their rum is good when it's bad?

16:23.573 --> 16:25.327
You. Up top, Jake.

16:25.363 --> 16:26.981
- Joyous.
- Uh, Camila,

16:27.017 --> 16:28.983
did you put your stuffing in my ceramic?

16:29.019 --> 16:31.586
- I thought it was a bowl.
- It's art.

16:31.622 --> 16:33.581
- [speaking Spanish]
- What does that mean?

16:33.617 --> 16:35.467
- What did she say?
- She said it was a bowl.

16:35.503 --> 16:37.051
Bet you didn't know
I understood Spanish.

16:37.087 --> 16:39.694
Very impressive. You learn that
from one of your mistresses?

16:39.729 --> 16:42.512
Yeah. As a matter of fact, I did.
Sounds like someone's jealous.

16:42.548 --> 16:45.334
- I bet you never even had sex.
- Oh, I've had sex.

16:45.370 --> 16:47.310
And I'm actually pretty good. Camila?

16:47.346 --> 16:49.199
- The best.
- What is happening right now?

16:49.235 --> 16:51.101
Roger's really good at sex too.

16:51.137 --> 16:53.535
- Ha, ha, I'm so grossed out.
- You know what?

16:53.571 --> 16:57.438
I'm sick of you
looking down your nose at us.

16:57.474 --> 16:59.126
I know the Peralta's aren't perfect,

16:59.162 --> 17:00.999
but we don't look down on other people.

17:01.035 --> 17:03.447
I mean, you come into our home
and you act like we're idiots.

17:03.483 --> 17:05.111
Well, we're not idiots. In fact...

17:05.146 --> 17:07.020
- I just cut my thumb off.
- What?

17:07.056 --> 17:08.454
I just cut my thumb off.

17:08.491 --> 17:09.958
[all scream]

17:09.992 --> 17:11.960
- Oh, my God!
- [shouting weakly]

17:11.994 --> 17:15.108
I think it's... It's bad.

17:16.285 --> 17:17.832
Excuse me, my father cut his thumb off.

17:17.867 --> 17:19.672
- We need help right now.
- Do you have the thumb?

17:19.708 --> 17:20.823
Yeah, I got it right here.

17:20.858 --> 17:22.409
It's in a plastic baggy.

17:22.444 --> 17:23.453
It's not just sitting on the ice cream.

17:23.489 --> 17:24.930
Okay, just fill out these forms.

17:24.965 --> 17:26.397
Someone will be with you in a bit.

17:26.434 --> 17:28.314
I think this might
be it for me, little man.

17:28.349 --> 17:30.049
There's something you gotta know, Jake.

17:30.085 --> 17:32.103
- You have three half-sisters.
- What?

17:32.139 --> 17:33.508
One in Atlanta, one in Newark,

17:33.544 --> 17:35.274
one in Dallas Fort Worth. All the hubs.

17:35.310 --> 17:37.076
Okay, we have to get him help right now.

17:37.112 --> 17:38.743
He can't die. I've gotta
hear more about this.

17:38.779 --> 17:41.478
It's a holiday, we're understaffed,
we'll get to your father eventually.

17:41.514 --> 17:43.280
He needs help now!

17:43.316 --> 17:45.599
You know who this man is?
Captain Roger Peralta.

17:45.634 --> 17:47.267
He taught Sully Sullenberger how to fly.

17:47.302 --> 17:49.065
It's just that we're understaffed.

17:49.101 --> 17:51.003
No excuses.
You're going to take this man

17:51.039 --> 17:53.442
to the OR right now or I'm gonna sue you

17:53.478 --> 17:55.575
- and everybody in this hospital.
- [groans]

17:55.862 --> 17:57.194
Uh, go with him.

17:57.230 --> 17:59.713
- I love you, buddy.
- Oh.

17:59.781 --> 18:01.948
- Thanks, that's nice.
- I love you, nurse.

18:02.159 --> 18:04.202
I love you lady in the scarf.

18:04.238 --> 18:05.585
Significantly less meaningful.

18:05.621 --> 18:08.336
- I love you candy machine.
- Victor, that was amazing.

18:08.372 --> 18:09.923
- Thank you so much for coming.
- Of course.

18:10.217 --> 18:11.850
Your mom and Camila are on the way.

18:11.886 --> 18:13.652
They're still cleaning up all the blood.

18:13.688 --> 18:15.462
Yeah, there was so much.
They might have to move.

18:15.497 --> 18:18.265
Babe, I'm really sorry
about all the things I said.

18:18.300 --> 18:20.467
- You know, I didn't mean it.
- Yeah, me neither.

18:20.502 --> 18:21.968
And, look, this is all my fault.

18:22.301 --> 18:26.473
I just wanted a big family Thanksgiving,
and I forced it, so it's on me.

18:26.508 --> 18:27.841
But, look, I love you, and...

18:27.876 --> 18:29.342
Is that still your dad's thumb?

18:29.378 --> 18:31.711
Oh, my God, yes. He needs this. Nurse?

18:31.747 --> 18:33.987
Hello, Raymond. Ready to go to dinner?

18:34.023 --> 18:37.217
Yes, but I have some
unfortunate news about our pie.

18:37.252 --> 18:38.916
- It was thrown away.
- No.

18:38.952 --> 18:40.608
- Are you serious?
- Mm-hmm.

18:40.644 --> 18:42.517
- And I know who did it.
- Who?

18:42.553 --> 18:45.956
You all bragged about
your Thanksgiving plans.

18:45.992 --> 18:49.684
Why? You were overcompensating.

18:49.720 --> 18:53.050
Trying to cover up your dark secrets,

18:53.086 --> 18:56.811
but there was one other person
who was also overcompensating.

18:56.847 --> 18:58.647
[snaps] You. Kevin.

18:58.683 --> 19:00.291
Even better than a plain scone.

19:00.327 --> 19:02.242
[slo-mo] Plain scone. Plain scone.

19:02.277 --> 19:03.777
I should have known you were lying.

19:03.813 --> 19:06.229
There's nothing better
than a plain scone.

19:06.265 --> 19:08.281
- This is ridiculous.
- Is it?

19:08.317 --> 19:10.134
Look how the pie was disposed of.

19:10.170 --> 19:12.352
Placed gently with two hands
inside the bin.

19:12.387 --> 19:14.387
That's exactly how
you always throw away garbage.

19:14.423 --> 19:15.889
- It is?
- There's only one thing

19:15.924 --> 19:18.095
I still can't figure out.

19:18.131 --> 19:20.629
- Why'd you do it?
- Because it's disgusting.

19:20.665 --> 19:22.231
- Oh, my.
- That pie is an abomination.

19:22.267 --> 19:24.523
It has beef suet and apple seeds in it.

19:24.559 --> 19:26.263
Why? It's a walnut pie.

19:26.299 --> 19:28.683
If we brought that to my family's house,
hey would have said something.

19:28.719 --> 19:32.019
- I was trying to protect you.
- Why didn't you just tell me the truth?

19:32.055 --> 19:34.374
[sighs] Because I love our annual trips

19:34.409 --> 19:35.842
to Saratoga Springs.

19:35.877 --> 19:37.577
The two of us driving in silence,

19:37.612 --> 19:39.446
looking at the barren trees.
It's perfect.

19:39.481 --> 19:42.404
I... I didn't wanna lose that.

19:43.352 --> 19:45.285
- I'm sorry.
- I don't know why we can't

19:45.320 --> 19:47.420
still make the drive next year.

19:47.456 --> 19:49.684
We just don't have to buy the pie.

19:49.720 --> 19:51.458
A trip with no purpose?

19:51.493 --> 19:53.470
[chuckles] Raymond...

19:54.329 --> 19:56.329
- Hey, Dad, how's it going?
- I'm fine.

19:56.365 --> 19:58.389
They reattached my thumb.

19:58.425 --> 20:00.859
Oh, that's great.
So you'll be able to fly again?

20:00.895 --> 20:02.328
Yeah, that was never in doubt.

20:02.364 --> 20:04.964
You don't need thumbs to fly anymore.
You just hit one button.

20:05.000 --> 20:06.325
The plane takes care of the rest.

20:06.361 --> 20:07.741
I have to believe that's not true.

20:07.776 --> 20:09.709
Oh, looks like Mom's
already tuckered out.

20:09.745 --> 20:11.644
Yeah, you know how tired
she gets when she drinks.

20:11.680 --> 20:13.946
- She won't be up for 12 hours.
- Hey, Jake,

20:13.982 --> 20:15.348
you know how you said
you always wanted to have

20:15.384 --> 20:17.717
a big family Thanksgiving?
I had five brothers,

20:17.753 --> 20:20.387
three sisters, four aunts,
and 12 cousins

20:20.422 --> 20:22.622
who spent every holiday together.

20:22.657 --> 20:24.591
I had the kind of family
that you dream of.

20:24.626 --> 20:27.659
[chuckles] Oh, are you done?

20:27.695 --> 20:29.023
That seemed like
a really mean place to stop,

20:29.059 --> 20:30.296
but you're taking a long pause.

20:30.332 --> 20:31.331
- When we all were together...
- Ah.

20:31.366 --> 20:32.699
Huge mess. I can't tell you

20:32.734 --> 20:34.601
how many holidays I spent in an ER.

20:34.636 --> 20:35.769
- [chuckles]
- But that's what it means

20:35.804 --> 20:37.437
to have a big family.

20:37.472 --> 20:38.872
Like this one.

20:38.907 --> 20:41.558
Oh. Well, thank you, Victor.

20:41.594 --> 20:43.527
And apparently my family's
a lot bigger than I thought.

20:43.563 --> 20:45.220
How many half sisters
did you say I have, Dad?

20:45.256 --> 20:46.659
I only told you about the sisters?

20:46.695 --> 20:48.719
- Come on.
- Roger, I want to apologize

20:48.755 --> 20:49.899
to you for being so defensive

20:49.935 --> 20:51.345
about you wanting
to pay for the wedding.

20:51.381 --> 20:53.319
I'm sorry too. It was stupid.

20:53.355 --> 20:54.821
I was just feeling insecure because...

20:54.856 --> 20:56.489
'Cause I gave Jake the watch?

20:56.525 --> 20:58.892
I was gonna say because you saw
my penis through my underpants,

20:58.927 --> 21:00.627
but the watch, yeah, sure.

21:00.662 --> 21:02.896
I was thinking, if you wanna
pay for the wedding,

21:02.931 --> 21:05.865
it would be fine, but we can split it.

21:06.224 --> 21:07.567
It's up to you.

21:07.916 --> 21:09.436
That seems fair.

21:09.722 --> 21:12.556
You're a good dude.
Come here, give me a hug.

21:12.592 --> 21:14.683
Give me a... hug me. Hug me.

21:14.719 --> 21:17.610
- Bring it in.
- Oh, Jake, it's happening.

21:17.646 --> 21:19.345
The weird but good dad hug.

21:19.381 --> 21:20.880
Oh, it's magical.

21:20.916 --> 21:22.816
- Best Thanksgiving ever.
- [sighs]

21:22.851 --> 21:24.812
Yep, Dad, your gown's riding up.

21:24.848 --> 21:26.147
- Oh.
- It's out.

21:26.183 --> 21:27.632
- Ooh, I...
- It's out.
