MALE NARRATOR:
<i>We are often told</i>

00:35.704 --> 00:41.251
<i>that happily-ever-afters exist only in
the pages of fairy tales</i>

00:41.418 --> 00:44.921
<i>and in the naive minds
of sheltered innocents.</i>

00:45.088 --> 00:49.134
<i>And yet, on this bright,
sunny, Boston afternoon,</i>

00:49.300 --> 00:53.263
<i>a talking teddy bear is about
to marry his girlfriend,</i>

00:53.430 --> 00:55.223
<i>proving two things.</i>

00:55.390 --> 00:58.476
<i>Happy endings can
come true for anyone.</i>

00:58.643 --> 01:02.105
<i>And America doesn't give
a shit about anything.</i>

01:02.647 --> 01:04.649
Do you,
Tami-Lynn McCafferty,

01:05.150 --> 01:08.945
take this teddy bear to be
your lawfully wedded husband?

01:09.320 --> 01:10.530
I do.

01:10.613 --> 01:12.157
SAM: And do you, Ted,

01:12.240 --> 01:15.785
take this woman to be your
lawfully wedded wife?

vested in me,

Oh, you guys
are getting married?

02:43.748 --> 02:45.667
No, we're just gonna go home

You okay, there?

02:58.429 --> 02:59.722
You look a little down.

02:59.806 --> 03:02.517
Are you still shaking off that
hangover from the bachelor party?

03:02.684 --> 03:04.394
Oh!
That's nice.

03:04.561 --> 03:06.437
Oh, my God.
She's fucking begging for it!

03:06.604 --> 03:09.482
(LAUGHS) She's totally begging. Get it.
Get in there.

She wants it bad!

03:11.776 --> 03:12.861

She wants more

03:12.944 --> 03:15.196

it was gonna be so perfect.

not the first guy

03:42.307 --> 03:43.474

Hey, hey!
Big day, huh, bud?

03:46.644 --> 03:50.481
You guys wanna celebrate with a little
something else, hmm?

03:50.648 --> 03:52.901
Oh. Uh, no, thanks, Sam.
Tami-Lynn would kill me

03:52.984 --> 03:54.569
if I did drugs
on our wedding day.

03:54.652 --> 03:56.279
Ah, she won't notice.

03:56.362 --> 03:58.656

11:41.702 --> 11:42.745
That's right.

11:42.828 --> 11:46.957
I've been led to understand that Trix are
exclusively for children.

11:47.291 --> 11:48.292
Is that correct?

11:48.834 --> 11:52.380
I... I mean, they say, uh,
"Trix are for kids" in the commercials.

11:52.463 --> 11:53.839
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

11:54.256 --> 11:56.425

11:57.093 --> 11:59.095
Uh, not to my knowledge, no.

So if I purchase these Trix,
there'll be no trouble?

12:03.849 --> 12:05.976
No. No, you...
You should be fine.

12:06.685 --> 12:09.355
You do understand
that I myself am not a child?

12:09.647 --> 12:11.982
Uh, I was able to
sniff that out, yeah.

12:13.818 --> 12:16.153

these back to my apartment.

I won't be followed?

22:26.888 --> 22:28.056
What are you talking about?

22:28.140 --> 22:29.474
For the sperm.

22:29.808 --> 22:34.563
Oh. Johnny, you kidding me, man?
You were the first person I wanted to go to.

22:35.022 --> 22:36.690
But you've just
been so bummed out

22:36.773 --> 22:37.899
over your divorce lately

22:38.025 --> 22:41.528
that I just... You know, I didn't want
to put you in an awkward position.

22:41.778 --> 22:43.196
And plus,
after seeing your laptop,

22:43.280 --> 22:44.781
I didn't think
you had any left.

22:45.115 --> 22:47.617
Just so you know,
I'm totally willing to do it.

22:48.201 --> 22:51.496
Really? You'd...
You'd do that for me?

22:51.747 --> 22:54.041
Ted, you're my best friend.
I'd do anything for you.

22:54.791 --> 22:58.295
Besides, we just broke into Tom Brady's
house and tried to jerk him off...

22:58.378 --> 23:00.005
You're ready to be a parent.

23:00.505 --> 23:02.215
God... (CHUCKLES)

23:02.299 --> 23:04.092
I don't know what to say.

23:04.301 --> 23:07.429
Johnny, thank you!
Thank you so much!

23:07.637 --> 23:10.390
Hey, thunder buddies
for life, remember?

23:10.766 --> 23:12.601
Thunder buddies for life.

23:12.768 --> 23:15.479
Come on. We got to get out of here
before the cops show up.

23:15.562 --> 23:19.608
MALE OFFICER: <i>All units,</i>
<i>we have a 3-17 on Maple Drive.</i>
<i>Area units, please respond.</i>

23:19.775 --> 23:21.276
What's a 3-17?

23:21.443 --> 23:24.321
Someone's trying to steal
Tom Brady's jizz again.

23:25.864 --> 23:27.783
(SIREN BLARING)
(TIRES SCREECH)

23:37.501 --> 23:39.002
What is that?
What?

23:39.086 --> 23:40.670
What are you doing?
I'm getting ready, dude.

23:40.754 --> 23:41.755
What do you mean
you're getting ready?

23:41.838 --> 23:43.090
What are you doing
to your hand?

23:43.173 --> 23:45.759
I'm doing this for you.
I'm getting ready.
I got to go in and perform.

23:45.842 --> 23:47.427
You got your hand on your dick.
What are you doing?

23:47.511 --> 23:48.762
I'm trying
to get it half hard,

23:48.845 --> 23:50.347
so when I get in there
I could just bust it out.

23:50.430 --> 23:52.224
Sitting out here in public,
jerking off?

23:52.307 --> 23:54.059
Where do you think you are?
Red Lobster?
What are you doing?

23:54.142 --> 23:55.435
What do you think
I got to do in there?

23:55.519 --> 23:56.895
Forget it.
Now, look, you haven't

23:56.978 --> 23:58.730
smoked pot for two
whole days, right?

23:58.814 --> 24:01.399
Yes, I told you, I'm clean, all right?
Your baby's gonna be fine.

24:01.525 --> 24:03.360
I'm sorry,
I just don't want something

24:03.443 --> 24:05.862
I got to feed with
a pitchfork when he's 16.

24:06.154 --> 24:07.364
"John Bennett."

24:07.447 --> 24:08.448
Hi.

24:08.532 --> 24:11.201
Right this way. I'll show you where to
deposit your specimen.

24:11.827 --> 24:13.537
Hey, Johnny. Johnny.

24:16.706 --> 24:18.041
(CHUCKLES)

24:23.463 --> 24:24.965
I'm John Bennett.

24:25.215 --> 24:27.134
(LAUGHS) I know,
I just said your name.

24:27.217 --> 24:29.803
Oh, right, yeah, sorry,
I'm just a little nervous.

24:29.886 --> 24:32.013
I've been out of
the game for a while.

24:32.222 --> 24:33.265
The game?

24:33.348 --> 24:37.435
I don't talk to pretty girls that often.
Pretty women, ladies.

24:38.061 --> 24:39.187
I see.

24:40.063 --> 24:41.743
Hey, when I'm done here,
how about a drink?

24:43.066 --> 24:46.403
(STAMMERS) Oh. I don't mean this.
I meant, like, a regular drink.

24:46.570 --> 24:48.071
I have a boyfriend.

24:48.780 --> 24:52.325
Oh. Yeah, okay, yeah.
Too bad. You're missing out on a great guy.

24:52.450 --> 24:55.495
Um, do I just spit in
my hand or do I get

24:55.579 --> 24:57.706
a lube or something?
A magazine?

24:57.956 --> 24:59.624
Video? I like Asian
teen stuff preferably.

24:59.708 --> 25:00.708
There's lube right there.

25:00.750 --> 25:02.502
All right,
yeah, thanks.

25:07.799 --> 25:10.677
Uh, excuse me.
Where's your non-jerk-off bathroom?

25:10.760 --> 25:12.137
Down that hallway,
to the left.

25:12.262 --> 25:13.638
Okay, thanks.

25:20.061 --> 25:21.521
Oh. No way!
(CHUCKLES)

25:22.731 --> 25:26.193
Oh, hey, Doc, is this where you guys
store all the, uh, stuff?

25:27.068 --> 25:30.030
It's the intermediary station
before insemination.

25:30.113 --> 25:31.239
Are you submitting?

25:31.323 --> 25:34.534
No. My friend is, uh, yanking out
a sample in one of the rooms.

25:35.243 --> 25:36.411
Oh, well, that's a good friend.
Yeah.

25:36.494 --> 25:37.537
I'm Dr. Danzer.

25:37.621 --> 25:38.705
Oh, cool. (CHUCKLES)

25:38.788 --> 25:42.500
(SINGING)
<i>Hold me closer, Dr. Danzer</i>

25:42.584 --> 25:43.704
Yeah, whatever,
I don't know.

25:43.752 --> 25:47.547
Now, wait. You look familiar.
Are you that teddy bear who came alive?

25:47.714 --> 25:49.049
I am. That's me, yeah.

25:49.132 --> 25:50.175
See, I was trying
to figure out

25:50.258 --> 25:51.551
where I'd seen you
before and that's it.

25:51.635 --> 25:52.719
Good eye, good eye.

25:52.802 --> 25:56.223
So, how did you get into this line
of work? Do you just love cum?

25:56.723 --> 25:57.724
Uh, uh...

25:57.807 --> 25:59.935
Not especially, but I love
helping good people

26:00.018 --> 26:01.811
fulfill their dreams
of having children.

26:01.895 --> 26:04.022
It's amazing
what we can do here.

26:04.481 --> 26:06.149
You want to have a look?

26:06.316 --> 26:07.776
Yeah, sure.

26:09.527 --> 26:13.323
This is where we perform our
pre-implantation genetic diagnosis.

26:13.406 --> 26:15.367
We can eliminate
hereditary diseases,

26:15.450 --> 26:18.620
such as cystic fibrosis,
muscular dystrophy, sickle-cell anemia.

26:18.745 --> 26:20.413
The list goes on and on, really.

26:20.497 --> 26:21.539
Wow.

26:22.082 --> 26:23.750
Hey, Johnny! You did it!

26:23.833 --> 26:24.834
Right here, buddy.

26:24.960 --> 26:26.670
Ew. I mean, awesome!
(CHUCKLES)

26:27.212 --> 26:29.047
Excuse me, Doctor,
your wife's on the phone.

26:29.130 --> 26:30.423
She said it's an emergency.

26:30.840 --> 26:32.550
Excuse me, I'll be right back.

26:34.302 --> 26:36.513
You wanna see it? Huh?
You wanna see your kid?

26:36.680 --> 26:37.973
I can see it from here,
thanks, yeah.

26:38.056 --> 26:39.432
Dude, take a closer look.
It's your kid.

26:39.516 --> 26:40.517
No, no, no!
Come on!

26:40.600 --> 26:42.435
You got to take a closer look.
That's close enough, Johnny!

26:42.519 --> 26:44.359
He's beautiful. Come on!
I'll trade you. Catch.

26:44.437 --> 26:46.147
Oh, shit!
Oh, God!

26:46.314 --> 26:47.983
Fuck! Dude,
that's somebody's kid!

26:48.149 --> 26:50.443
Well, it's not my fault,
A-Rod! You were supposed to catch it!

26:50.527 --> 26:51.569
We got to find something
to scoop it up.

26:51.653 --> 26:53.238
There's containers over there.
Scoop it up with that.

26:53.321 --> 26:54.656
Shit. All right.

26:55.073 --> 26:56.116
TED: No, no,
that's not gonna work.

26:56.199 --> 26:57.867
You need two of them.
You got to scoop one into the other.

26:58.368 --> 26:59.953
Oh, shit! Fuck!

27:01.204 --> 27:02.497
TED: Oh!
Oh, fuck!

27:02.580 --> 27:03.581
Oh, my God!

27:03.665 --> 27:04.666
Fuck! Fuck!

27:04.833 --> 27:06.918
Oh, my God! It's in my eyes!

27:07.043 --> 27:08.044
I'm blinking it in!

27:08.128 --> 27:09.379
(GAGGING)
You got to fucking help me!

27:09.462 --> 27:11.089
Oh, my God!
It's in my fucking mouth!

27:11.172 --> 27:12.841
Hang on. I got to
post this on Facebook.

it was an accident.

We're so sorry.

Well, I guess it's all right.
Those are the rejected sickle-cell samples.

27:26.187 --> 27:27.564
Ah, you hear that,
Johnny?

27:27.689 --> 27:29.607
You're covered in
rejected black-guy sperm.

You look like a Kardashian.

27:31.192 --> 27:32.402

No, make sure you
have all the updated

27:46.958 --> 27:48.626
information on our
Comic Con placement.

27:48.710 --> 27:52.005
This has to be the biggest,
most impressive rollout at the convention.

27:52.088 --> 27:53.214
Morning, Mr. Jessup.

27:53.923 --> 27:55.425
Good morning. Now...

27:55.508 --> 27:57.010
My name's Donny.

27:57.135 --> 27:59.387
(SIGHS) Hi, Donny.
Hi.

27:59.471 --> 28:01.181
Now this is
a multi-platform release,

28:01.264 --> 28:02.474
so I want a full
report on all...

28:02.557 --> 28:03.767
Fresh cakes.

28:05.810 --> 28:06.853
What?

28:06.936 --> 28:08.355
In the urinals, sir.

28:08.938 --> 28:10.940
I noticed you always
use urinal four,

28:11.024 --> 28:12.776
so I put fresh cakes
in there for you.

28:12.901 --> 28:15.904
You're an important man.
You should never have to smell pee.

28:16.613 --> 28:19.449
See, most people
flip the cakes.

28:20.033 --> 28:21.701
I replace the cakes.

28:22.619 --> 28:24.746
That's the Donny difference.

28:26.915 --> 28:29.751
I need a full report on all the
placement of our merchandise.

28:29.834 --> 28:32.045
Contact Bob Jennings
at Javits...

28:34.089 --> 28:35.632
I'm afraid I have bad news.

28:36.007 --> 28:38.760
I won't be able to perform
the implantation procedure.

28:38.927 --> 28:40.637
Wait, what?
Why not?

28:40.804 --> 28:44.808
Tami-Lynn, according to your test results,
you're no longer fertile.

28:44.974 --> 28:45.975
What?

28:46.059 --> 28:47.977
Wait, Doc,
are you sure about that?

28:48.144 --> 28:50.230
I mean, maybe you should check again
or something, you know?

28:50.438 --> 28:51.648
I'm quite sure.

28:51.815 --> 28:54.859
Tami-Lynn, because of your history
of excessive drug use

28:55.527 --> 28:58.905
your ovarian canal
has been somewhat compromised.

28:59.072 --> 29:00.952
What are you talking about?
It looks fine. Yeah.

29:01.991 --> 29:04.285
Forgive me,
that's a normal ovary.

29:04.369 --> 29:05.912
This is Tami-Lynn's.

29:06.079 --> 29:07.247
TED: Jesus!

29:07.372 --> 29:09.624
Yeah, but I bet this
stuff happens a lot.

29:09.707 --> 29:11.947
You probably see this kind
of stuff all the time, right?

29:12.127 --> 29:14.379
No, not once, not ever.

29:14.546 --> 29:17.757
When I saw this, I threw up.
Almost quit medicine.

29:18.007 --> 29:20.760
Bottom line is,
insemination is not possible.

29:21.302 --> 29:24.431
(SOBS) I don't understand, okay?
None of this makes any sense.

29:24.514 --> 29:26.474
It's okay. It's okay, honey.
Come on, let's just go.

29:26.558 --> 29:27.976
No, what does
this mean, Teddy?

29:28.059 --> 29:29.269
Does it mean we
can't have a baby?

29:29.352 --> 29:30.854
I don't know.
But it's gonna be okay.

29:30.937 --> 29:32.439
Everything's gonna be okay.

29:32.605 --> 29:33.857
It really isn't.

29:46.327 --> 29:48.580
Well, I have gone
through your application

29:48.663 --> 29:50.874
and vetted your
personal histories,

29:52.041 --> 29:53.960
and I'm afraid this
isn't gonna work out.

29:55.044 --> 29:56.129
What?

29:56.296 --> 29:57.380
Why not?

29:57.464 --> 29:59.024
Well, first of all,
there's the question

29:59.090 --> 30:00.758
of Tami-Lynn's
drug conviction.

30:00.925 --> 30:02.677
Hey, I did my community service.

30:02.760 --> 30:05.388
Yeah, besides, that was five years ago.
She's clean.

30:06.181 --> 30:07.432
There's another issue,

30:07.515 --> 30:10.560
and, honestly,
it's the more serious one.

30:10.643 --> 30:12.896
I was reluctant to
bring it up because

30:14.189 --> 30:15.690
it's a little awkward.

30:16.483 --> 30:20.528
Ted, in the eyes of the state,
you are not a person.

30:21.738 --> 30:23.323
Wait, what?

30:24.407 --> 30:26.618
The state official
I spoke to said

30:26.701 --> 30:29.829
that technically, you are
classified as property.

30:31.998 --> 30:34.417
I'm not a person?

30:34.834 --> 30:37.670
Not according to
the government. I'm sorry.

30:37.754 --> 30:39.464
But that is so fucked up!

30:40.215 --> 30:41.508
"Property"?

30:41.591 --> 30:43.593
You know what, Teddy?
Let's get out of here.

30:43.843 --> 30:44.844
Come on.

30:44.928 --> 30:46.095
(SIGHS)

30:46.471 --> 30:47.597
Look.

30:47.764 --> 30:49.557
You seem like good people.

30:49.724 --> 30:50.975
Be careful.

30:51.142 --> 30:53.144
What do you mean, "Be careful"?

30:53.228 --> 30:55.188
The state official I spoke to

30:55.271 --> 30:58.900
made it sound like your status had
gone under the radar for some time.

30:59.442 --> 31:02.111
Your adoption request
may have raised some red flags.

31:02.695 --> 31:05.448
If they choose to
investigate the issue,

31:05.615 --> 31:08.159
it may leave you
quite vulnerable.

31:21.297 --> 31:23.758
Hey. I just got off work
and heard your message.

31:23.841 --> 31:25.468
Is that for real?
Did they actually tell you that?

31:25.552 --> 31:27.262
Yeah, it's unbelievable.
"Property."

31:27.470 --> 31:29.055
They said I'm property.

31:29.305 --> 31:31.224
What does that even mean?
Like, you're a thing?

31:31.307 --> 31:33.142
What, like garbage
or a piece of shit?

31:33.601 --> 31:37.063
I mean, maybe more like a hammer
or an orange, but yeah.

31:37.146 --> 31:38.356
What the hell
do they know?

31:38.439 --> 31:39.482
It's just a word.

31:39.566 --> 31:41.943
They can't change your whole
life just by calling you property!

31:42.026 --> 31:44.946
Bullshit!
You better ask my ancestors.

31:45.154 --> 31:47.490
One minute, you in Africa,
washing your clothes

31:47.574 --> 31:49.492
in the river,
titties out. You good.

31:49.659 --> 31:51.369
Then all of a sudden,
you somewhere

31:51.452 --> 31:53.371
across the world,
fucking Thomas Jefferson.

31:53.496 --> 31:55.832
Wow! You make
history come alive.

for a moment?

32:10.555 --> 32:11.681
I'm sorry,

32:11.764 --> 32:13.308

have to let you go.

32:13.516 --> 32:17.186

my ass at this job for three years!

32:17.437 --> 32:19.689
I just got a call from
the Labor Department.

32:20.690 --> 32:22.650
I can't legally keep
you on as an employee

that you're technically...

32:25.028 --> 32:28.239

Yeah. Jesus Christ!

passed her bar exam

and I've hired her on
as a junior associate here at the firm.

35:22.955 --> 35:25.291
I could assign her to
your case, pro bono.

35:25.416 --> 35:27.256
And then you would get
a hungry, young attorney

35:27.293 --> 35:30.546
and I would get a more
experienced lawyer in return.

35:30.838 --> 35:32.089

I ask how old you are?

36:12.547 --> 36:14.048
I'm 26.

36:14.257 --> 36:15.258
Ah.

36:15.508 --> 36:16.968
What, is there a problem?

36:17.051 --> 36:19.051
Well, you know,
I just don't want my lawyer singing

36:19.095 --> 36:20.847

the opening arguments.

36:20.930 --> 36:22.682
It's just this is
a really important case.

36:22.765 --> 36:25.165
Ted has already lost his job,
his marriage has been annulled.

36:25.226 --> 36:27.478
I know. My uncle
gave me all the details.

36:27.645 --> 36:29.772
Right. You see, the thing is, we don't
want to take any chances

36:29.856 --> 36:31.816
because the stakes
are so significant.

36:31.941 --> 36:33.109
We can't just
rush into anything.

we're making the right decision.

appreciate your time,

36:36.112 --> 36:37.321

we're probably gonna do is

just take a seat
and get to work.

36:39.031 --> 36:40.032
Trust you completely.

Please, the War on Drugs
is a joke.

37:32.793 --> 37:34.113

for the government

37:34.170 --> 37:35.588
to inflate law
enforcement budgets

37:35.671 --> 37:38.299
and lock up minorities
for no good legal reason.

37:38.382 --> 37:40.968

are an oppressed minority.

the same rights s everybody else

42:27.588 --> 42:28.881
Well, then, what's the "F"
stand for?

42:28.964 --> 42:29.965
Francis.

42:30.090 --> 42:31.592
No. It's got to be "Fuck."
It must be "Fuck."

42:31.675 --> 42:33.010
It's got to be "Fuck."
It has to be "Fuck."

42:33.093 --> 42:34.261
Why the hell
would it be "Fuck"?

42:34.345 --> 42:36.013
Well, because otherwise,
why wouldn't he just say it?

42:36.096 --> 42:37.473
Yeah, he's hiding
something. It's "Fuck."

42:37.514 --> 42:39.391
Come on, read between the lines, Sam.
It's "Fuck."

42:39.475 --> 42:41.644
(LAUGHS) That's completely
insane. You guys are idiots.

42:41.727 --> 42:44.813
Yeah, well, whatever.
Ted Clubber Lang.
Get used to it.

42:49.360 --> 42:50.486
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

42:50.569 --> 42:51.612
Yes!

42:53.489 --> 42:54.490
Sir?

42:54.823 --> 42:57.701
Um, one of the janitors
would like to see you.

42:58.160 --> 42:59.161
I'm busy.

42:59.662 --> 43:01.288
Fresh cakes!
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

43:02.122 --> 43:03.165
What is it, Danny?

43:03.374 --> 43:04.583
Uh, Donny, sir.

43:04.667 --> 43:08.087
Well, Donny, I'm extremely
busy with the Comic Con presentation...

43:08.170 --> 43:10.547
I'm told that you have an
open-door policy here at Hasbro

43:10.631 --> 43:13.175
for new toy ideas
from any and all employees?

43:14.176 --> 43:15.970
Yeah, I suppose that's true.

43:17.179 --> 43:18.514
All right, come in.

43:18.681 --> 43:20.140
Okay.

43:20.307 --> 43:22.851
Thank you. Thank you.
I love your dress.

43:28.983 --> 43:30.192
Mr. Jessup,

43:30.401 --> 43:32.820
I can make this company
a billion dollars.

43:33.195 --> 43:34.363
I'm listening.

43:35.489 --> 43:36.532
Thirty years ago,

43:36.699 --> 43:38.993
a little boy named
John Bennett made a wish

43:39.076 --> 43:41.328
that his teddy bear
would come to life.

43:41.495 --> 43:43.747
Somehow, one of
our Hasbro bears...

43:43.831 --> 43:45.541
Yes, I'm aware of the story.

43:47.376 --> 43:49.086
Have you seen this?

43:49.628 --> 43:51.255
(SIGHS)

43:54.258 --> 43:55.342
So what?

43:55.426 --> 43:58.595
Well, Ted is suing
for his civil rights.

43:58.762 --> 44:01.640
If he loses, the state
will officially declare him

44:01.724 --> 44:04.351
a non-entity with
no rights under the law.

44:04.893 --> 44:07.021
That means he becomes property.

44:07.479 --> 44:08.647
Mr. Jessup,

44:09.690 --> 44:13.902
we could take him back, with only a
trivial degree of legal consequence

44:13.986 --> 44:15.529
if we were even caught.

44:15.738 --> 44:17.323
And why would we do this?

44:17.406 --> 44:22.411
Sir, if we could cut him open to see
what makes him tick,

44:22.578 --> 44:26.707
we could manufacture millions of
Teds for every child in the world.

44:26.832 --> 44:29.418
Hasbro would double
its profits overnight.

44:30.502 --> 44:31.545
Go on.

44:31.628 --> 44:34.423
We just have to make sure
Ted loses the case.

44:34.631 --> 44:37.676
You use every back channel,
every bribe,

44:37.801 --> 44:39.053
you call in every favor

44:39.136 --> 44:43.432
and you get the best lawyer in
the world on the defense.

44:43.932 --> 44:46.977
When Ted's rights
are officially null,

44:48.437 --> 44:49.897
we grab him.

44:51.315 --> 44:54.401
No one's going to kick up a
legal fuss over property.

44:55.110 --> 44:58.322
You're a hell of a lot smarter than
your urinal cakes, Danny.

44:58.781 --> 44:59.948
Really?

45:00.115 --> 45:02.451
Now, what exactly
do you want from this?

45:03.160 --> 45:05.913
Mr. Jessup,
I'm not interested in money.

45:08.332 --> 45:10.667
I just want a Ted
for my very own.

45:11.835 --> 45:14.963
All right.
I think I can handle the defense.

45:15.964 --> 45:17.549
But let's make
one thing clear.

45:17.633 --> 45:19.301
We never had this conversation.

45:19.551 --> 45:22.971
Goldner and the board cannot know
about this until we have him.

45:23.514 --> 45:24.890
Do you understand?

45:24.973 --> 45:26.308
(WHISPERS) Yes, I do.

45:26.892 --> 45:28.227
(EXHALES)

45:29.853 --> 45:31.855
I need Shep Wild.

45:34.691 --> 45:37.277
SAMANTHA: That was such
a good dinner, Tami-Lynn.

45:37.403 --> 45:39.238
I've never had
Pringles on my steak before.

45:39.321 --> 45:40.489
Oh, it's my pleasure.

45:40.572 --> 45:43.951
It's the least I can do
with all you're doing for us. Really.

45:44.034 --> 45:46.286
Oh, I haven't done anything yet.

45:46.370 --> 45:48.080
Well, you know,
we wanted to take you out to dinner,

45:48.163 --> 45:52.167
but, uh, (SIGHS) all we got is Tami's income
these days since nobody will hire me.

45:52.251 --> 45:53.710
Things are getting
really tight, huh?

45:53.836 --> 45:56.213
Yeah, I've had to do
some things I'm not proud of.

45:56.505 --> 45:59.883
BJs here! Get your BJs!
Get your red-hot BJs!

45:59.967 --> 46:02.761
Toothless and ready to go.
Just 3 dollar! 3 dollar!

46:02.845 --> 46:04.179
Get your BJs here.

46:04.596 --> 46:05.722
Wow.

46:05.806 --> 46:07.057
Hey, listen,
I got an idea.

46:07.141 --> 46:09.685
Uh, Tami, what do you say
you and me go do the dishes

46:09.768 --> 46:12.312
and give Sam and Diane here
some alone time, eh?

46:12.646 --> 46:14.857
(LAUGHS)
All right, all right.

46:15.149 --> 46:17.568
Hey, you go pull
a bad back, bitch!

46:19.194 --> 46:20.612
What do you think
that was about?

46:20.904 --> 46:22.948
Oh, it's nothing. That's his way of saying
I should ask you out.

46:23.031 --> 46:24.074
Ah.

46:24.158 --> 46:25.242
Uh, yeah, look...

46:25.325 --> 46:27.953
We should probably focus our
attention on the case for now.

46:28.036 --> 46:29.663
I completely agree.

46:30.706 --> 46:34.793
You know, I am a little bit curious.
How is it that a guy like you is unattached?

46:35.919 --> 46:40.382
Well, I was married at one point,
but it just didn't work out.

46:40.549 --> 46:42.718
Shits. I'm sorry. That sucks.

46:42.885 --> 46:46.346
No. I mean,
we'd make it work day to day,

46:46.805 --> 46:48.485
but she was always
just trying to change me

46:48.515 --> 46:49.725
into someone I'm not.

46:49.892 --> 46:51.602
And I tried, you know?

46:52.436 --> 46:55.898
I really tried everything
I could to be the man that she wanted.

46:56.398 --> 46:59.985
One day I woke up and I just realized
I wasn't myself anymore.

47:00.819 --> 47:04.907
You know, as much as I love this person,
we're completely wrong for each other.

47:05.657 --> 47:07.826
At least you
figured it out early.

47:08.118 --> 47:09.678
Some people go through
their whole lives

47:09.745 --> 47:11.580
trying to make it work
with the wrong person.

47:12.164 --> 47:13.415
Yeah.

47:14.708 --> 47:16.126
So, we're gonna
win this thing?

47:16.585 --> 47:18.462
Honestly, I don't know.

47:18.837 --> 47:20.339
Oh, we're betting on you.

47:21.131 --> 47:23.571
Hey, Johnny, come on.
It's almost 7:00.
We got to get up there.

47:23.634 --> 47:24.927
Hey, Sam,
you want in on this?

47:25.010 --> 47:26.053
What is it?

47:26.136 --> 47:29.139
On Tuesday nights, we get fucked up
and throw apples at joggers.

47:33.310 --> 47:34.353
Oh, there's one!

47:34.436 --> 47:35.938
(ALL LAUGH)

47:36.021 --> 47:37.397
TED: How's your workout?
JOGGER: Fuck you!

47:37.481 --> 47:39.358
Eat my pussy!
Have some apples!

47:39.441 --> 47:40.943
Jesus, what the hell
is your problem?

47:41.443 --> 47:43.654
It's everybody
else's fault, Mary Decker!

47:44.071 --> 47:45.155
Bam!

47:45.239 --> 47:47.407
You sons of bitches!
What the fuck is your...
(GRUNTS)

47:47.950 --> 47:49.201
(ALL EXCLAIMING)

47:50.661 --> 47:52.788
That's the lottery!
That's the lottery!

47:52.871 --> 47:55.499
That's what you get
for fucking exercising!

47:55.958 --> 47:57.709
That is unbelievable!

48:32.160 --> 48:33.245
Teddy.

48:34.329 --> 48:35.747
Teddy, I'm scared.

48:35.831 --> 48:37.082
Baby, we're gonna be fine.

48:37.165 --> 48:40.377
I don't care what any fucking piece
of paper says. You're my wife.

48:40.752 --> 48:42.504
I love you so much.

48:42.588 --> 48:43.839
And I swear to God,
if we lose,

48:43.922 --> 48:45.507
I'm gonna
fucking cut that judge.

48:45.674 --> 48:47.217
Wait a minute.
You brought your switchblade?

48:47.301 --> 48:48.302
Yeah.

48:48.385 --> 48:50.762
But they patted us down on the way in here.
Where'd you even hide it?

48:50.846 --> 48:52.264
Oh!

48:53.515 --> 48:54.558
Hey, Sam.

48:55.350 --> 48:56.935
Who's that buttnut over there?

48:59.396 --> 49:02.524
That is why we've been working so hard.
That's Shep Wild.

49:02.608 --> 49:04.359
It's our bad luck
they put him on the trial.

49:05.027 --> 49:06.820
He's never lost
a case in his life.

49:07.446 --> 49:11.158
Mr. Wild, your opening statement,
if you please.

49:11.450 --> 49:12.826
Thank you, Your Honor.

49:13.744 --> 49:16.538
I would first like to thank
the ladies and gentlemen of the jury

49:16.913 --> 49:19.708
for taking time out
of their busy schedules

49:20.125 --> 49:21.960
to be a part of
these proceedings.

49:22.419 --> 49:27.633
Now, the case we'll be examining today
is really quite a simple one.

49:28.008 --> 49:30.260
Is Ted a human being?

49:30.719 --> 49:32.304
Or a piece of property?

49:33.138 --> 49:38.935
You know, it really is a very special,
very unique thing to be human.

49:39.645 --> 49:43.523
It's a gift from God
bestowed upon only one species.

49:43.982 --> 49:45.025
Us.

49:45.651 --> 49:48.445
But if we suddenly decide
to share that gift,

49:49.446 --> 49:50.906
where does that lead us?

49:51.573 --> 49:53.575
Does your dog
deserve human rights?

49:54.076 --> 49:55.369
Your cat?

49:55.452 --> 49:56.870
Your toaster?

49:56.953 --> 49:57.996
(SOFT CHUCKLE)

50:00.082 --> 50:03.293
Suddenly, being human
doesn't seem so special anymore, does it?

50:04.461 --> 50:07.172
I'm confident you'll make
the right decision.

50:08.215 --> 50:10.967
JUDGE: Thank you, Mr. Wild,
for your opening statement.

50:11.343 --> 50:12.552
Ms. Jackson?

50:18.475 --> 50:19.685
Hi.

50:20.602 --> 50:22.479
I am Samantha Jackson.

50:22.938 --> 50:25.148
I got to be honest
with you. I'm...

50:25.941 --> 50:27.859
I'm a little nervous.
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

50:28.318 --> 50:29.986
Why am I nervous? Um...

50:31.071 --> 50:34.616
Well, not because I'm a junior
attorney arguing her first case.

50:35.283 --> 50:36.868
And not because
some of you might laugh

50:36.952 --> 50:39.663
at the fact that
I'm representing a teddy bear.

50:39.871 --> 50:41.123
(SOFT LAUGHTER)

50:42.457 --> 50:46.753
No, I'm... I'm nervous because
of one simple word.

50:49.214 --> 50:50.465
"Justice."

50:51.383 --> 50:56.054
I'm nervous that you're going
to be swayed

50:56.221 --> 50:59.224
by smooth talk
and a haircut,

50:59.474 --> 51:03.603
and forget about the most
important aspect of this case.

51:04.980 --> 51:06.148
Justice.

51:07.899 --> 51:09.276
A hundred and fifty years ago

51:09.401 --> 51:11.737
a slave by the name
of Dred Scott

51:11.820 --> 51:15.407
sued to prove that he was a
person and not a piece of property.

51:15.866 --> 51:17.325
He lost.

51:17.576 --> 51:21.580
And as history has shown us,
that wasn't justice.

51:23.874 --> 51:26.543
In every
civil rights conflict,

51:27.210 --> 51:31.256
we are only able to recognize
the just point of view

51:31.339 --> 51:33.175
years after the fact.

51:33.675 --> 51:35.844
And when the next conflict
comes along,

51:36.011 --> 51:39.014
we're once again
blind to it as it's happening.

51:40.015 --> 51:43.435
"Well, this is different,"
we say, but it isn't.

51:44.603 --> 51:47.773
It is the same beast,
just wearing a different face,

51:47.856 --> 51:49.483
and it's happening again today.

51:51.026 --> 51:54.237
So I urge you,
ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

51:54.404 --> 51:57.532
not to be a footnote
on the wrong side of history.

52:00.202 --> 52:02.370
Don't wait too long
to be right.

52:04.039 --> 52:05.123
Thank you.

52:09.211 --> 52:10.212
Erection.

52:10.378 --> 52:11.922
Sustained.

52:14.549 --> 52:17.552
Ms. McCafferty, you and Ted recently
considered adopting a child.

52:17.636 --> 52:18.678
Is that correct?

52:19.054 --> 52:20.096
Yeah.

52:20.514 --> 52:21.807
And if I may inquire,

52:21.890 --> 52:24.142
why did you not choose to have
a child of your own?

52:24.851 --> 52:26.353
Because Teddy
ain't got no dick.

52:26.686 --> 52:28.104
(LAUGHTER)

52:30.106 --> 52:31.149
Uh-huh.

52:31.233 --> 52:35.946
And, uh, why does Ted
not possess a, uh, male appendage?

52:36.404 --> 52:37.781
Is it a freak of genetics?

52:38.073 --> 52:40.492
No, asshole, he ain't got a dick
because he's a fucking toy!

52:40.575 --> 52:41.618
What's your excuse?

52:41.743 --> 52:43.370
Whoa-ho! Take a burn!

52:43.453 --> 52:45.914
Yeah! How's your tongue
taste in your own ass, Poindexter?

52:45.997 --> 52:47.207
Yeah! How'd you...
What?

52:47.332 --> 52:49.042
(GAVEL BANGS)
Order!

52:50.252 --> 52:51.336
Mr. Bennett,

52:51.920 --> 52:55.090
how would you categorize
your relationship with Ted?

52:56.007 --> 52:57.259
He's my best friend.

52:57.676 --> 52:59.761
So you don't see him
as your property.

53:00.095 --> 53:02.722
No, he's not my property.
He's a person.

53:02.806 --> 53:04.846
He's way more of a person
than lots of other people.

53:04.891 --> 53:06.268
I mean,
fucking Steven Tyler?

53:06.351 --> 53:07.602
What the fuck is that?
Some kind of

53:07.686 --> 53:09.271
weird soccer-mom-looking
Goonie monster?

53:09.354 --> 53:10.856
Your Honor?
I'll allow it.

53:11.189 --> 53:12.649
Thank you, Your Honor.

53:13.316 --> 53:14.776
Your witness.

53:15.277 --> 53:16.611
(CLEARS THROAT)

53:18.280 --> 53:19.489
Mr. Bennett,

53:20.365 --> 53:22.617
when and where did
you first encounter Ted?

53:23.118 --> 53:25.453

01:13:12.556 --> 01:13:14.141
Listen, I just really
want to thank you

01:13:14.224 --> 01:13:16.060
for all you've done,
all you're doing for us.

01:13:16.143 --> 01:13:17.936
I know it's not
making you rich.

01:13:18.020 --> 01:13:19.063
Please.

01:13:19.146 --> 01:13:21.398
There are more important things
in life than money.

01:13:22.816 --> 01:13:24.026
Look,

01:13:24.735 --> 01:13:26.945
I don't know what
kind of mojo was in

01:13:27.029 --> 01:13:28.739
that wish you made
when you were a child,

01:13:28.822 --> 01:13:30.699
but this bear is alive.

01:13:31.658 --> 01:13:35.704
And it seems to me that once the law
devalues one kind of life,

01:13:36.330 --> 01:13:38.499
how soon before
it devalues another?

01:13:38.832 --> 01:13:40.751
Who gets subjugated
after the bear?

01:13:42.377 --> 01:13:44.379
You're really smart,
you know that?

01:13:45.756 --> 01:13:46.965
How come
you don't have a guy?

01:13:47.341 --> 01:13:49.593
Dude, have you seen
the guys in Boston?

01:13:49.676 --> 01:13:51.678
I'm supposed to date
some pale, blotchy guy

01:13:51.762 --> 01:13:53.680
with a wife-beater
under his Bruins jacket

01:13:53.764 --> 01:13:56.183
and a shamrock tattoo
on his calf? Nope.

01:13:56.266 --> 01:13:57.309
Yeah. (CHUCKLES)

01:13:57.392 --> 01:13:58.685
That's so dumb.

01:13:59.686 --> 01:14:01.188
(GRUNTS) I couldn't
find any cans,

01:14:01.271 --> 01:14:03.941
but I got to tell you,
there's some awesome shit in that barn.

01:14:04.024 --> 01:14:07.069
Take a look at this. I found a cowboy
hat and a rifle and a guitar.

01:14:07.277 --> 01:14:08.654
Hey, be careful
with that, huh.

01:14:08.821 --> 01:14:10.021
No, it's okay.
It's not loaded.

01:14:11.907 --> 01:14:14.076
And my fucking nose came off.

01:14:15.577 --> 01:14:17.538
Jeez, I wonder who
this place belongs to.

01:14:17.663 --> 01:14:19.663
Maybe we should find someplace else.

If we get out of here
by dawn, we should be fine, right?

01:14:26.088 --> 01:14:27.339
You play the guitar?

01:14:28.215 --> 01:14:30.717

Was it just kissing last night?
Or was there finger stuff?

smoke it, all right,

reviewing your file.

And while I'm sympathetic
to your cause,

01:20:18.398 --> 01:20:21.610
I'm sorry to say
I won't be taking your case.

01:20:21.735 --> 01:20:22.819

Why?

01:20:22.903 --> 01:20:23.904
Why not?

Well, it comes down to this.

01:20:27.908 --> 01:20:30.702
You want to be human
in the eyes of the law.

01:20:31.036 --> 01:20:33.413
That's a hard sell,
even for me.

01:20:33.914 --> 01:20:36.333
See, the important
thing about being human

01:20:36.416 --> 01:20:38.793
is making a contribution
to society.

01:20:38.877 --> 01:20:41.254
Assisting in
the betterment of your race.

01:20:41.630 --> 01:20:43.423
You've done none of that.

01:20:43.590 --> 01:20:45.217
I've read about your life.

01:20:45.383 --> 01:20:48.553
The drugs, the parties,
the prostitutes, the arrests.

01:20:48.637 --> 01:20:51.056
Mr. Meighan, we've come
a long way to meet you

01:20:51.139 --> 01:20:52.766
because you said
that you could help us.

01:20:53.099 --> 01:20:55.018
I said I would consider it.

01:20:55.602 --> 01:20:56.937
And I have.

01:20:58.271 --> 01:21:00.607
Ted, you're special.

01:21:00.941 --> 01:21:03.318
You could've been
an inspiration to the world.

01:21:03.485 --> 01:21:05.654
Could've been a leader,
a role model.

01:21:06.613 --> 01:21:08.240
Instead you're

Hey, Ted! Come on!
I'm sorry.

01:21:13.286 --> 01:21:15.288
He doesn't mean that.
Please forgive me, I'm sorry.

01:21:15.455 --> 01:21:16.748
There's just no indication

01:21:16.831 --> 01:21:19.751
that you've had any positive effect
on the world around you.

01:21:19.918 --> 01:21:22.587
Well, that's not true.
He's had a positive effect on me.

01:21:22.754 --> 01:21:25.632
Would that positive effect
be your joint arrest

01:21:25.715 --> 01:21:28.051
for purchasing
marijuana in 2003?

01:21:28.134 --> 01:21:30.845
Well, how the fuck do you prepare for
a Foo Fighters concert?

01:21:32.681 --> 01:21:34.724
You know why
you lost this case?

01:21:36.309 --> 01:21:38.311
It can't be argued by reason.

01:21:38.687 --> 01:21:41.815
The precedent it sets would affect
the public directly.

01:21:42.023 --> 01:21:45.277
And unfortunately,
the public doesn't judge by reason.

01:21:45.360 --> 01:21:47.571
It judges by emotion.

01:21:48.947 --> 01:21:51.783
And you can't appeal
an emotional conviction.

01:21:52.200 --> 01:21:55.662
Nonetheless, I wish you all the best
in your efforts.

01:21:57.998 --> 01:21:59.499
He needs help.

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:01.501
And from what
I know about you,

01:22:01.668 --> 01:22:04.045
at one point in your
career that would've been enough.

01:22:04.921 --> 01:22:08.341
I'm sorry you're not
who I hoped you'd be.

01:22:17.058 --> 01:22:18.893
Are those Tootsie Rolls
just, like, to take?

01:22:21.021 --> 01:22:23.231
Those aren't
supposed to be out.

01:22:34.367 --> 01:22:36.411
So that's it.
I'm property.

01:22:37.203 --> 01:22:39.080
No rights, no nothing.

01:22:39.706 --> 01:22:42.709
Ted, dude, I'm so sorry, man.
This completely sucks.

01:22:43.084 --> 01:22:44.544
I feel terrible.

01:22:45.170 --> 01:22:47.047
I let you guys down
all over again.

01:22:47.172 --> 01:22:50.383
Hey. You didn't let us down, Sam.
You did your best.

01:22:51.593 --> 01:22:53.178
And, look,
regardless of all this shit,

01:22:53.261 --> 01:22:55.847
you're still the best thing that's
happened to me in a long time.

01:23:02.062 --> 01:23:03.063

That's fucking great!

01:23:04.481 --> 01:23:05.523
I'm glad you guys
are so happy!

01:23:05.607 --> 01:23:06.650
What?

01:23:06.733 --> 01:23:08.733
What do you mean, "What?"
I'm totally screwed here.

01:23:08.777 --> 01:23:11.279
And you're sitting there
basically banging my lawyer,

01:23:11.363 --> 01:23:13.083
and she's probably
still fucking billing us!

01:23:13.114 --> 01:23:15.200
Well, don't yell at us, dude!
We didn't do anything!

01:23:15.367 --> 01:23:16.660
Yeah, exactly! Exactly!

01:23:16.743 --> 01:23:19.829
Maybe if you guys had spent a little
less time mooning over each other,

01:23:19.913 --> 01:23:22.749
Sam could've won this
thing and I wouldn't be a fucking thing!

01:23:22.832 --> 01:23:25.001

right alongside you the whole way.

you're the one

who's been pushing me
to get back on the horse.

01:23:30.090 --> 01:23:32.008
I finally meet someone
and you're giving me shit for it?

01:23:32.092 --> 01:23:33.677
Oh, no, you're right.
No, Johnny, it's fine.

01:23:33.760 --> 01:23:34.844
You're right, it's fine.
It's totally fine.

01:23:34.928 --> 01:23:37.347
I got no job,
no marriage and no life!

01:23:37.430 --> 01:23:40.517
But you have fun porking Gollum here,
while I'm left with shit!

Who's Gollum?

01:23:43.061 --> 01:23:45.105
She's a model.
Ted, come back!

01:23:45.271 --> 01:23:46.356
Leave me alone!

Hey, what's going on?
What are you doing here?

01:24:55.467 --> 01:24:59.846

What are you guys doing here?

Oh, thanks a lot.
What's your name?

I'm Raphael.

I could take a picture with you?

when people recognize you.

What, you mean since
you ripped me in half?

01:26:14.254 --> 01:26:15.964
That wasn't supposed to happen.

01:26:16.130 --> 01:26:17.632
That was an accident.

01:26:18.466 --> 01:26:20.718
I have some big plans
for you, Ted.

He could be anywhere.
We're not gonna find him.

We should just
wait by the car.

We have to find him, okay?

01:34:40.551 --> 01:34:41.719
What do you wanna do now?

01:34:41.802 --> 01:34:45.348
You don't deserve him, John.
You never did. You never did!

01:34:45.639 --> 01:34:47.641
I've been wanting
to do this for a long time.

I wanna tell you how sorry I am.

01:35:08.496 --> 01:35:09.705
No, forget it, buddy.

01:35:09.789 --> 01:35:12.583
Look, Teddy, you were upset, and I shouldn't
have brushed it off. I'm so sorry.

01:35:12.666 --> 01:35:13.751
No, listen to me.

01:35:13.834 --> 01:35:16.087
Just listen to me.
You, too, Sam.

01:35:16.170 --> 01:35:18.130
I acted like an asshole.

01:35:18.214 --> 01:35:21.801
All right? I was just hurting
because I knew I'd lost.

And that, in the eyes of the world,
I'll always be property.

But you know what?
Who gives a shit? Right?

01:35:29.975 --> 01:35:33.270
It doesn't matter what the world calls me.
I know who I am.

that's important.

would make me happier.

Aw, buddy,
I love you for that.

01:35:44.824 --> 01:35:46.700
Thanks, Ted. That means a lot.

01:35:48.869 --> 01:35:52.164

as far as I'm concerned,

I've ever known.

anyone who can inspire that
kind of love in another person

01:44:22.549 --> 01:44:24.426

The anthropologist
and ethicist Dawn Prince-Hughes

01:44:57.417 --> 01:45:02.547
argues that the standards for personhood
include self-awareness,

01:45:03.215 --> 01:45:06.385
an ability to understand
complex emotions

01:45:06.718 --> 01:45:09.262
and a capacity for empathy.

01:45:26.488 --> 01:45:29.950
As for complex emotions
and the capacity for empathy,

01:45:30.701 --> 01:45:32.953
we all saw
the distressing images

01:45:33.036 --> 01:45:35.497

over his fallen friend,

01:45:35.998 --> 01:45:37.040

In those images,

Ted exhibits all of
the remaining qualities of personhood.

It's right there
for anyone to see.

01:45:50.095 --> 01:45:54.474

a just court must, by definition,

01:45:55.308 --> 01:45:59.146
grant basic human rights
to all those who deserve them,

01:46:00.439 --> 01:46:03.150
just as
the Emancipation Proclamation

01:46:03.400 --> 01:46:06.945

Amendment did so many years ago.

01:46:58.705 --> 01:47:00.499
This is quite a victory
for you.

01:47:00.582 --> 01:47:02.667
Is there any statement
that you'd like to make

01:47:02.751 --> 01:47:04.169
now that
you're legally a person?

01:47:04.711 --> 01:47:06.129
Yes, there is.

01:47:08.548 --> 01:47:10.050
Tami-Lynn McCafferty,

01:47:10.425 --> 01:47:12.094
will you marry me?

01:47:13.678 --> 01:47:14.846
Yes.

01:47:15.055 --> 01:47:16.348
(ALL CHEERING)

01:47:20.560 --> 01:47:23.355
MALE NARRATOR: <i>And so
our story comes to an end.</i>

01:47:23.688 --> 01:47:26.650
<i>Ted and Tami-Lynn
were married once again,</i>

01:47:26.733 --> 01:47:31.446
<i>and soon afterward,</i>
<i>they adopted a fine,</i>
<i>young baby boy.</i>

01:47:31.696 --> 01:47:33.865
Johnny,
meet your new godson,

01:47:34.032 --> 01:47:35.784
Apollo Creed Clubber Lang.

01:47:35.867 --> 01:47:37.953
JOHN: Oh, Teddy,
he's adorable.

01:47:38.120 --> 01:47:40.789
Oh! And we got something for him, too.
John, show him.

01:47:40.872 --> 01:47:42.290
Oh, shit, yeah. Hold on.

01:47:42.374 --> 01:47:43.834
TAMI-LYNN:
He got you something.

01:47:45.418 --> 01:47:46.461
Huh?

01:47:46.545 --> 01:47:47.963
Oh, Johnny!

01:47:48.130 --> 01:47:50.006
TAMI-LYNN:
Oh, Johnny, it's perfect.

01:47:50.173 --> 01:47:53.009
Hey, you know, maybe someday,
if you wish hard enough,

01:47:53.176 --> 01:47:54.511
maybe he'll come to life

01:47:54.678 --> 01:47:56.805
and you guys can do
all kinds of drugs together.

01:47:57.097 --> 01:47:58.807
That's all I want for him.

01:47:58.890 --> 01:48:02.811
Oh! It smells like somebody's got
a poopy diaper.

01:48:02.978 --> 01:48:04.378
Teddy, it's your turn
to change him.

01:48:04.479 --> 01:48:05.814
Oh, yeah, no problem.

01:48:06.606 --> 01:48:09.067
TED: <i>Oh! Fuck me!</i>
TAMI-LYNN: <i>What's the matter?</i>

01:48:09.151 --> 01:48:10.991
TED: <i>That can't be normal.
He's got to be sick.</i>

01:48:11.027 --> 01:48:12.946
TAMI-LYNN: <i>He's not sick,
it's just baby doody.</i>

01:48:13.029 --> 01:48:14.281
JOHN: <i>Yeah, that's what
babies do, Teddy.</i>

01:48:14.406 --> 01:48:16.283
TED: <i>Oh, you don't think this diaper's gross?</i>
JOHN: <i>No.</i>

01:48:16.408 --> 01:48:17.826
TED: <i>All right.</i>
<i>Here, catch.</i>
