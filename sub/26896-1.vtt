WEBVTT

03:30.001 --> 03:31.291
Whoa!

03:33.796 --> 03:37.966
A song never fails
to ease my mind out here in the West,

03:38.259 --> 03:41.849
where the distances are great
and the scenery monotonous.

03:42.597 --> 03:47.477
Additionally, my pleasing baritone
seems to inspirit ol' Dan here

03:47.560 --> 03:51.440
and keep him in good heart
during the day's measure of hoof clops.

03:51.814 --> 03:53.274
Ain't that right, Dan?

03:55.235 --> 03:57.105
Maybe some of y'all have heard of me.

03:57.362 --> 04:02.032
Buster Scruggs, known to some
as the San Saba Songbird.

04:02.617 --> 04:06.657
I got other handles, nicknames,
appellations, and cognomens,

04:07.205 --> 04:11.375
but this one here I don't consider
to be even halfway earned.

04:11.584 --> 04:14.254
"Misanthrope"? I don't hate my fellow man,

04:14.921 --> 04:18.341
even when he's tiresome and surly
and tries to cheat at poker.

04:18.882 --> 04:21.392
I figure that's just a human material,

04:21.469 --> 04:24.349
and him that finds in it
cause for anger and dismay

04:24.430 --> 04:26.560
is just a fool for expecting better.

04:27.100 --> 04:28.270
Ain't that right, Dan?

04:30.186 --> 04:33.856
Well, folks,
unless I grievously misremember,

04:34.232 --> 04:37.742
there's a little cantina
on the other side of yon rimrocks.

04:37.902 --> 04:40.782
And if I'm in luck,
there'll be customers there

04:40.863 --> 04:44.083
amenable to drawing up in a circle
around a deck of cards.

05:03.177 --> 05:07.307
I'd like me a splash of whiskey
to wash the trail dust off my gullet

05:07.390 --> 05:09.430
and keep my singing voice in fettle.

05:10.810 --> 05:11.890
Whiskey's illegal.

05:12.729 --> 05:13.859
This is a dry county.

05:17.275 --> 05:18.735
Well, what are they drinking?

05:20.695 --> 05:21.695
Whiskey.

05:23.114 --> 05:24.204
They's outlaws.

05:24.282 --> 05:25.282
Oh!

05:25.325 --> 05:28.945
Well, don't let my white duds
and pleasant demeanor fool ya.

05:29.120 --> 05:32.000
I too have been known to violate
the statutes of man,

05:32.081 --> 05:34.331
and not a few of the laws of the Almighty.

05:34.584 --> 05:35.924
You ain't no outlaw.

05:37.086 --> 05:38.956
And we don't drink with tinhorns.

05:40.465 --> 05:44.425
Sir, it seems that you are no better
a judge of human beings

05:44.510 --> 05:45.850
than you are a specimen of one.

05:46.387 --> 05:47.717
Just on a brief inventory,

05:47.805 --> 05:51.175
I'd say that you could use yourself
a shave and a brighter disposition.

05:51.893 --> 05:55.313
And lastly, if you don't mind me
aspersin' your friends,

05:55.396 --> 05:57.396
a better class of drinking buddy.

06:08.451 --> 06:09.911
Your shootin' iron work?

06:15.917 --> 06:17.207
Appears to do. Yes.

06:34.977 --> 06:36.517
Huh.

06:36.604 --> 06:40.534
It appears that the vitals of this lucky
son-of-a-gun remain unpunctured.

06:40.608 --> 06:42.398
Sloppy shootin' on my part.

06:45.279 --> 06:48.239
Here now, I'll get that for you, partner.

06:48.741 --> 06:52.251
A coup de grâce I'll leave to the wolves
and gila monsters.

06:52.328 --> 06:53.998
Adios, amigo.

07:07.176 --> 07:08.796
Frenchman's Gulch.

07:09.095 --> 07:10.805
This town is new to me.

07:19.105 --> 07:20.225
Hold on, son.

07:20.815 --> 07:22.105
House policy.

07:24.819 --> 07:26.069
Here's the six-shooter.

07:26.654 --> 07:29.624
You'll be wanting
the senorita pistols as well?

07:29.949 --> 07:31.869
Everything. House policy.

07:32.368 --> 07:33.948
Feel a bit naked, but...

07:34.412 --> 07:37.082
I guess with everyone
similarly disadvantaged,

07:37.165 --> 07:39.375
there's scant chance of misadventure.

07:39.459 --> 07:42.459
- I'm out.
- Well, this is well-timed.

07:42.670 --> 07:44.960
You gentlemen mind if I take his spot?

07:45.840 --> 07:47.930
If'n you play his hand.

07:52.805 --> 07:56.425
- I would prefer not to.
- It is too late.

07:56.517 --> 07:58.057
You have regarded the cards.

07:58.144 --> 08:00.404
You seen 'em, you play 'em.

08:01.063 --> 08:02.063
I ain't anted.

08:02.190 --> 08:03.980
The other hombre anted.

08:06.110 --> 08:08.570
You seen em, you play 'em.

08:09.071 --> 08:10.201
And if'n I don't?

08:16.954 --> 08:19.254
You play them cards, fancy Dan.

08:19.790 --> 08:23.790
Can't no-one compel another man
to engage in recreation.

08:24.128 --> 08:27.008
Certainly not a son of a gun
as ill-humored as yourself.

08:27.423 --> 08:30.473
And as for names, my horse is Dan.

08:30.760 --> 08:34.140
- I'm Buster. Buster Scruggs.
- Buster Scruggs?

08:35.181 --> 08:37.311
The runt from Reata Pass?

08:38.808 --> 08:40.349
And dis-pistoled.

08:45.650 --> 08:47.650
I do hail from Reata Pass

08:47.735 --> 08:50.855
which is in the county of San Saba,
being the which-a-why

08:50.947 --> 08:54.117
the San Saba Songbird
is my sobriquet of preference.

08:54.492 --> 08:56.202
But right now, I'd appreciate it

08:56.285 --> 08:59.905
if you deposit your weapon
in the receptacle by the swinging doors,

08:59.997 --> 09:02.537
which concealing of it on your person
in the first place

09:02.625 --> 09:05.455
was a violation of the rules
of this establishment

09:05.545 --> 09:07.455
and an offense against local norms.

09:10.007 --> 09:11.377
And if'n I don't?

09:26.691 --> 09:28.941
I'm not a devious man by nature,

09:29.443 --> 09:33.363
but when you're unarmed, your tactics
might gotta be downright Archimedean.

10:15.573 --> 10:16.573
Yee-haw!

10:30.713 --> 10:32.383
Yee-haw!

10:34.884 --> 10:37.934
Joey?

10:42.433 --> 10:43.983
Joe? Surly Joe!

10:44.101 --> 10:45.981
Yee-haw!

10:49.106 --> 10:50.667
We've lost him!

11:00.034 --> 11:02.504
Yee-haw!

11:03.371 --> 11:06.041
You killed my brother,
you cowardly son of a bitch!

11:06.791 --> 11:09.211
Gunned him down
when he wasn't hardly looking.

11:09.293 --> 11:12.303
I can cut you a little slack,
grieving as you are,

11:12.380 --> 11:16.180
but the fact is, Buster Scruggs
don't shoot nobody in the back,

11:16.258 --> 11:19.798
and that sorry sack of bones
was more in the nature of a suicide.

11:20.137 --> 11:21.257
You're Buster Scruggs?

11:21.889 --> 11:23.139
The West Texas Twit?

11:24.767 --> 11:27.557
I assume you meant West Texas Tit,

11:27.645 --> 11:30.605
on account of that particular bird's
mellifluous warble.

11:31.273 --> 11:33.233
Call yourself any damn name you please.

11:33.317 --> 11:34.687
I want to see you outside.

11:35.069 --> 11:36.149
Wearing iron!

11:37.822 --> 11:40.742
Things have a way of escalating
out here in the West

11:40.825 --> 11:43.445
with one thing leading to another, but...

11:43.869 --> 11:47.749
I should be able to make pretty short work
of this ramified old son-of-a-gun.

11:47.832 --> 11:51.002
Scruggs! Scruggs!

11:51.585 --> 11:52.995
I'ma calling you out!

11:53.087 --> 11:56.547
Now, just hang on there, partner.
I had to strap on my tool belt.

11:56.841 --> 11:58.431
- Are you ready?
- Ready!

11:58.759 --> 12:00.339
- Are you set?
- Set!

12:00.761 --> 12:03.311
- Do you need a count?
- No, sir!

12:06.809 --> 12:09.229
Hard to trigger
with them other fingers, but...

12:13.941 --> 12:15.401
...you can't be too careful.

12:18.904 --> 12:21.204
Whoa.
Looks like when they made this fella,

12:21.282 --> 12:22.622
they forgot to put in the quit.

12:23.951 --> 12:26.081
Five fingers at a bullet a piece.

12:26.996 --> 12:29.326
I ain't got but the one bullet left.

12:30.291 --> 12:31.631
Sure hope I don't miss.

12:32.710 --> 12:33.630
Let me see here.

12:33.711 --> 12:36.801
His heart would be on the left,
but in the mirror it'd be on the right.

12:36.881 --> 12:40.591
Of course, we is both facing the same way
and the gun is upside down, so...

12:41.343 --> 12:43.263
Yeah, best not to play it too fancy.

12:47.600 --> 12:49.140
Cause for reflection.

12:51.979 --> 12:53.769
Puts me in mind of a song.

13:45.199 --> 13:46.449
Buster Scruggs.

13:47.159 --> 13:50.659
The same.
You make a sweet noise there, partner.

13:51.080 --> 13:54.710
That's high praise
coming from the San Saba Song Bird.

13:55.292 --> 13:56.502
Herald of Demise.

13:57.461 --> 14:01.011
I've been hunting you up on account
of they say you're the one to beat,

14:01.090 --> 14:03.380
singing and slinging guns.

14:05.344 --> 14:07.514
Another young fella
with something to prove.

14:08.556 --> 14:11.636
I gotta set myself up
in the undertaking business.

14:12.101 --> 14:13.981
Stop doing all the skill work

14:14.061 --> 14:15.651
so another man can profit.

14:16.605 --> 14:19.775
But then,
do I want to wear a black suit?

14:20.526 --> 14:22.816
- You need a count?
- No, sir.

14:42.965 --> 14:45.125
Well, that ain't good.

14:59.690 --> 15:01.530
I shoulda seen this coming.

15:03.819 --> 15:05.949
Can't be top dog forever.

17:01.979 --> 17:05.858
There's just gotta be a place
up ahead where men ain't low down,

17:05.941 --> 17:07.861
and poker's played fair.

17:08.986 --> 17:12.406
If there weren't,
what are all the songs about?

17:13.031 --> 17:14.781
I'll see y'all there.

17:15.117 --> 17:17.237
And we can sing together

17:17.327 --> 17:22.247
and shake our heads
over all the meanness in the used to be.

18:58.512 --> 18:59.682
Fancy place.

19:00.139 --> 19:02.809
It's a comfort to the depositors.

19:05.352 --> 19:06.482
Who'd that be?

19:06.770 --> 19:10.980
Oh, we got folks from over Val Verde,
Chloride, Tucumcari itself, of course.

19:11.066 --> 19:12.856
Why, the whole entire three-county area.

19:12.943 --> 19:15.783
Hell, we even had a run on the bank once,
weren't pretty.

19:15.863 --> 19:18.823
Had to hop on the counter here
with my scattergun,

19:18.907 --> 19:20.947
talk the folks down. Well...

19:21.577 --> 19:22.827
that's banking.

19:24.037 --> 19:25.907
Ah, crazy business.

19:26.665 --> 19:27.825
Crazy business.

19:30.878 --> 19:32.128
Ever been robbed?

19:33.255 --> 19:36.795
Oh, sure I have.
Two times, attempted, I should say.

19:36.884 --> 19:39.304
One fella I shot dead. Bingo!

19:39.386 --> 19:42.426
The other I held for the marshal.
Both his legs were shredded some,

19:42.514 --> 19:44.274
had to lock him in the vault there.

19:44.349 --> 19:46.349
Marshal don't come through
but once a month,

19:46.435 --> 19:48.055
and he'd just visited the previous week.

19:48.145 --> 19:50.055
Had to billet that scamp for what,

19:50.147 --> 19:53.937
three weeks, applying a poultice
of wet leaves and urine.

19:54.026 --> 19:57.696
He's in Yuma now, busting rocks.
Still a little gimpy from what they say.

19:57.779 --> 20:00.619
Fella by the name of Civilly...
uh, Chevilly,

20:00.699 --> 20:03.659
unless I misremember,
said his pappy was...

20:06.830 --> 20:07.830
from...

20:08.790 --> 20:09.790
from France.

20:11.919 --> 20:13.169
All the cash.

20:14.004 --> 20:16.884
Okay, you got me, young fella.
You got me fair and square.

20:17.257 --> 20:19.257
The large denominations I gotta...

20:20.469 --> 20:21.469
stoop for.

21:26.159 --> 21:28.999
Psst! Hey! Come here.

21:30.455 --> 21:32.455
Timmy, get over here.

21:32.541 --> 21:33.541
Hey!

21:46.680 --> 21:48.390
Bad shot!

21:51.893 --> 21:53.193
Pan-shot!

21:55.605 --> 21:57.515
Pan-shot!

22:04.114 --> 22:05.794
Do you have anything to say?

22:10.120 --> 22:12.870
Do you have anything to say?

22:14.916 --> 22:18.166
Do you have anything to say
before the sentence is carried out?

22:19.379 --> 22:20.629
Sentence?

22:22.507 --> 22:24.927
What's my sentence?

22:29.931 --> 22:33.941
Son, we just held some proceedings here
for attempted bank robbery.

22:34.478 --> 22:36.768
You was off your nut feverish
for most of the goings on,

22:36.855 --> 22:40.225
but it was a fair trial
like we do here in New Mexico.

22:41.276 --> 22:42.646
These peers convicted you.

22:43.195 --> 22:46.025
I passed the sentence of death
and we found us this tree.

22:46.531 --> 22:48.621
Now this here is your opportunity
to speak your piece

22:48.700 --> 22:50.540
before your sentence is carried out.

22:54.706 --> 22:56.996
That pan-covered son of a bitch
back at the bank

22:57.084 --> 22:59.094
don't hardly fight fair, in my opinion.

23:02.297 --> 23:03.297
Okay.

23:05.133 --> 23:06.133
That it?

23:06.843 --> 23:08.263
I reckon it is.

23:08.845 --> 23:10.925
- Can I have your horse?
- No, me.

23:14.518 --> 23:16.688
You wanna give one of these boys
your horse?

23:17.020 --> 23:18.980
Save scrapping over it after you pass?

23:20.315 --> 23:22.145
I don't want any of them to have it.

23:22.234 --> 23:23.994
Selfish bastard.

23:45.382 --> 23:46.882
Whoa. Whoa.

24:44.691 --> 24:45.691
Whoa!

24:45.817 --> 24:47.857
Whoa.

24:47.944 --> 24:49.864
Whoa.

24:49.988 --> 24:51.318
Easy. Easy.

25:19.267 --> 25:20.767
Oh, shit. Easy.

25:21.186 --> 25:22.186
Whoa.

25:47.254 --> 25:49.974
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

25:50.048 --> 25:51.048
Easy.

26:00.809 --> 26:01.809
Hey!

26:08.191 --> 26:09.321
Over here!

26:41.433 --> 26:42.433
Comanche?

26:42.851 --> 26:44.141
- Yeah.
- Yup.

26:54.487 --> 26:55.737
Hold still.

26:59.409 --> 27:02.199
I sure do appreciate you helping me
with these beeves.

27:02.579 --> 27:05.119
Them two compañeros I hired
to help walk 'em to Abilene

27:05.206 --> 27:08.036
started grousing about the wages
once the weather turned hot,

27:08.126 --> 27:11.296
and finally they left.
Now I come to be here by my lonesome.

27:11.880 --> 27:13.800
That's what you call
a fair-weather friend,

27:13.882 --> 27:15.222
- I tell you.
- Hmm.

27:15.300 --> 27:18.640
Yep, them boys didn't understand
the first thing about sidekicking.

27:18.970 --> 27:21.430
Hey, maybe you can sidekick up with me
on a permanent basis,

27:21.514 --> 27:22.684
this drive works out.

27:23.099 --> 27:26.059
Yeah, you seem trustworthy enough.
That's why I make the proposition.

27:26.561 --> 27:28.811
Why, a sidekick should be a reliable man.

27:28.897 --> 27:30.750
It's the very nature the sidekick.

27:30.774 --> 27:34.444
Like there's this cowpoke I knew,
thought I knew.

27:34.527 --> 27:35.527
The per...

27:40.700 --> 27:42.700
Dammit! Yah!

27:43.286 --> 27:44.906
Yah! Yah!

27:55.882 --> 27:58.092
No hats in the presence of Judge Hobby.

27:58.176 --> 27:59.836
- What'd this sumbitch do?
- Sir, I...

27:59.928 --> 28:02.758
Hold your tongue!
Sumbitch is a stock rustler.

28:02.847 --> 28:04.467
- Alleged.
- Yes, Your Honor.

28:04.557 --> 28:05.951
- Sir, I never...
- Hold your tongue!

28:05.975 --> 28:07.555
He was caught driving rustled beeves.

28:08.144 --> 28:09.354
Good enough. Hang him.

28:36.881 --> 28:37.881
Mmm.

28:38.383 --> 28:40.473
- First time?
- Huh?

29:03.324 --> 29:04.624
There's a pretty girl.

31:53.286 --> 31:54.616
I met a traveler...

31:56.039 --> 31:57.749
in an antique land...

31:58.249 --> 32:01.879
who said, "Two vast and trunkless legs

32:02.629 --> 32:04.009
stand in the desert.

32:05.381 --> 32:09.841
Near them on the sand,
half sunk, a shattered visage lies,

32:09.928 --> 32:12.258
whose frown and wrinkled lip

32:13.181 --> 32:15.681
and sneer of cold command...

32:16.601 --> 32:19.441
tell that its sculptor
well those passions read,

32:19.520 --> 32:23.860
which yet survive,
stamped on these lifeless things...

32:25.818 --> 32:27.568
the hand that mocked them,

32:28.780 --> 32:30.240
and the heart that fed.

32:31.491 --> 32:34.741
And on the pedestal, these words appear:

32:36.079 --> 32:37.369
'My name...

32:38.414 --> 32:40.084
is Ozymandias,

32:41.709 --> 32:42.709
king of kings!

32:44.420 --> 32:47.920
Look on my works, ye mighty, and despair!'

32:50.760 --> 32:52.720
Nothing beside remains.

32:53.513 --> 32:56.353
Round the decay of that colossal wreck,

32:57.600 --> 32:59.060
boundless and bare...

33:00.103 --> 33:02.563
The lone and level sands stretch

33:03.606 --> 33:04.606
far away."

33:04.774 --> 33:09.204
And the Lord said unto Cain,
"Where is Abel, thy brother?"

33:09.278 --> 33:12.068
When to the sessions
of sweet silent thought,

33:12.240 --> 33:14.580
I summon up remembrance
of things past...

33:14.659 --> 33:17.699
I all alone beweep my outcast state

33:17.787 --> 33:20.117
and trouble deaf heaven

33:20.581 --> 33:22.251
with my bootless cries...

33:22.333 --> 33:25.673
Four score and seven years ago...

33:25.753 --> 33:29.173
...and that government of the people,
by the people...

33:30.883 --> 33:33.223
for the people...

33:34.679 --> 33:36.009
shall not perish

33:37.181 --> 33:38.181
from the earth.

33:58.202 --> 34:01.502
Our revels now are ended.

34:02.290 --> 34:05.170
These, our actors, as I foretold you,

34:05.710 --> 34:07.250
were all spirits

34:07.336 --> 34:09.755
and are melted into air, into thin air.

34:09.839 --> 34:10.839
God bless you, sir.

34:10.922 --> 34:13.183
And like the baseless fabric
of this vision...

34:13.259 --> 34:15.219
Found him in the streets
of London, England.

34:15.261 --> 34:17.181
Armless, legless, rest assure.

34:17.263 --> 34:18.603
Motherless and penniless.

34:18.681 --> 34:20.271
...the great globe itself,

34:20.349 --> 34:22.438
yea, all which it inherit,
shall dissolve.

34:22.518 --> 34:23.388
God bless you.

34:23.478 --> 34:26.748
- Thank you. Coin for the young artists.
- And like this insubstantial planet faded,

34:26.773 --> 34:29.652
leave, not a rack behind.

35:22.078 --> 35:23.368
On we go. Come on.

35:24.247 --> 35:25.457
Up, there you go.

35:32.213 --> 35:35.223
And it came to pass
when they were in a field,

35:35.716 --> 35:40.466
that Cain rose up against Abel his brother
and slew him!

35:43.224 --> 35:47.694
And the Lord said unto Cain,
"Where is Abel, thy brother?"

35:48.604 --> 35:50.064
And he said, "I know not.

35:50.439 --> 35:54.239
Am I my brother's keeper?"
And the Lord said, "What has thou done?"

35:54.318 --> 35:58.108
When to the sessions
of sweet silent thought

36:00.032 --> 36:03.332
I summon up remembrance of things past.

36:03.411 --> 36:06.501
I sigh the lack of many a thing I sought,

36:06.914 --> 36:10.674
and with old woes, new wail,
my dear time's waste.

36:12.253 --> 36:15.803
Then can I drown an eye unus'd to flow,

36:16.716 --> 36:20.386
for precious friends hid,
in death stateless night,

36:20.761 --> 36:23.891
and weep afresh love's long
since cancell'd woe,

36:24.515 --> 36:28.185
and moan the expense
of many a vanished sight.

36:29.604 --> 36:33.864
That this nation under God
shall have a new birth of freedom,

36:34.692 --> 36:38.612
and that government of the people,
by the people,

36:39.113 --> 36:40.873
for the people...

36:41.282 --> 36:44.292
shall not perish from the Earth.

36:54.378 --> 36:57.048
Our revels now are ended.

36:58.382 --> 37:00.132
And these our actors...

38:32.143 --> 38:35.233
I met a traveler in antique land...

38:35.313 --> 38:37.733
It blesseth him that gives
and him that takes...

38:37.815 --> 38:40.475
I sigh the lack of many a thing I sought.

38:41.902 --> 38:44.492
I met a traveler in an antique land...

38:44.572 --> 38:47.832
My punishment is greater than I can bear.

38:47.908 --> 38:50.578
Stamped on these lifeless things.

38:51.704 --> 38:54.874
Four score and seven years ago,
our fathers...

38:54.957 --> 38:57.877
I met a traveler in an antique land.

38:57.960 --> 38:59.800
And moan the expense...

38:59.879 --> 39:00.959
A fugitive...

39:01.047 --> 39:02.127
A shattered visage lies...

39:02.214 --> 39:03.764
And a vagabond, thou shalt be!

39:05.509 --> 39:08.429
For thy sweet love remembered
such wealth brings.

39:09.138 --> 39:11.928
That then I scorn to change my state...

39:12.850 --> 39:14.100
with kings.

40:24.880 --> 40:26.420
We're going into town!

40:35.349 --> 40:38.639
Oh!

40:51.073 --> 40:52.073
All right.

41:10.718 --> 41:11.718
There.

41:45.920 --> 41:47.760
Wanna buy your friend some lovin'?

41:50.674 --> 41:51.934
I don't think so.

41:53.385 --> 41:54.635
He ever had any?

41:56.931 --> 41:57.931
Once.

42:00.184 --> 42:01.774
When in disgrace...

42:02.853 --> 42:06.113
with fortune and men's eyes,

42:07.691 --> 42:12.111
I all alone beweep my outcast state...

42:13.989 --> 42:18.039
and trouble deaf heaven
with my bootless cries

42:19.703 --> 42:21.413
and look upon myself...

42:23.207 --> 42:24.667
and curse my fate.

42:26.585 --> 42:30.335
Wishing me like to one more rich in hope,

42:31.924 --> 42:34.224
featured like him, like him,

42:34.802 --> 42:36.642
with friends possessed,

42:38.681 --> 42:42.181
desiring this man's art
and that man's scope

42:43.143 --> 42:46.693
with what I most enjoy contented least.

42:48.190 --> 42:52.990
Yet in these thoughts myself
almost despising,

42:54.863 --> 42:58.033
haply I think on thee,
and then my state,

42:58.117 --> 43:02.117
like to the lark at break of day
arising from sullen earth,

43:02.204 --> 43:06.004
sings hymns at heaven's gate...

43:06.083 --> 43:08.293
And that government of the people,

43:09.295 --> 43:10.295
by the people...

43:11.380 --> 43:13.800
for the people...

43:15.301 --> 43:18.801
shall not perish from the Earth.

43:26.478 --> 43:29.478
Our revels now are ended.

43:29.898 --> 43:34.568
And these, our actors,
as I foretold you, were all spirits

43:34.653 --> 43:37.873
and are melted into air, into thin air.

43:38.157 --> 43:40.697
And like the baseless fabric
of this vision,

43:40.784 --> 43:45.044
the cloud-capp'd towers,
the gorgeous palaces, the...

44:08.812 --> 44:10.942
One at a time, ladies and gentlemen.

44:11.231 --> 44:13.981
Yeah. Twenty-one divided by three.

44:14.985 --> 44:18.235
There it is! There's the answer.

44:18.489 --> 44:19.819
There's the solution.

44:19.907 --> 44:22.947
Is he right? Is he clever?

44:23.035 --> 44:24.945
He's self-taught, ladies and gentlemen.

44:25.079 --> 44:29.209
He has no formal education.

44:29.291 --> 44:31.211
One at a time, ladies and gentlemen.

44:31.293 --> 44:33.463
Test that chicken's brain.

44:33.712 --> 44:37.342
Gallus Mathematicus,
in the feather, in the flesh.

44:38.217 --> 44:39.427
Seven plus three!

44:39.510 --> 44:42.140
- Eleven twice! Eleven twice!
- Yes, right there.

44:42.262 --> 44:43.642
I have 11 twice.

44:44.723 --> 44:47.143
The chicken is calculating,
ladies and gentlemen.

44:47.559 --> 44:49.599
Watch this fowl thing.

44:50.270 --> 44:52.270
That's a 22!

44:53.440 --> 44:56.780
- What a genius chicken!
- Eighteen take away seven.

44:56.860 --> 44:58.360
Eighteen take away seven.

45:00.906 --> 45:02.316
Eleven!

45:02.408 --> 45:05.198
Oh! Eleven, ladies and gentlemen!

45:05.285 --> 45:07.495
The Calculating Capon!

45:07.579 --> 45:09.579
The Pecking Pythagorean!

46:48.847 --> 46:49.927
Whoa.

51:54.111 --> 51:55.821
Come on, Lucky.

52:59.676 --> 53:00.756
Mm-hmm.

53:01.845 --> 53:02.925
Maybe...

53:57.442 --> 53:58.572
Two.

54:36.648 --> 54:37.648
Oh.

54:39.359 --> 54:40.779
Not a speck.

54:43.154 --> 54:45.204
Ahh. Let's go the other way.

54:58.628 --> 54:59.838
Four.

55:02.340 --> 55:03.380
Seven.

55:06.136 --> 55:07.636
Twelve.

55:09.848 --> 55:12.138
Five. Going down.

55:13.560 --> 55:14.560
Three.

55:15.395 --> 55:16.395
Two.

55:22.694 --> 55:23.744
Back to nothing.

55:26.031 --> 55:27.031
Ha!

55:34.164 --> 55:35.254
Okay.

55:36.499 --> 55:39.999
There's a pocket up there.
How far, we don't know.

55:42.505 --> 55:43.625
You're up there.

55:46.676 --> 55:48.256
Okay, Mr. Pocket.

55:49.095 --> 55:50.095
All right.

55:50.513 --> 55:52.603
I'ma coming!

55:53.183 --> 55:54.393
I'ma coming.

55:54.476 --> 55:56.096
You just sit there,

55:56.394 --> 55:57.694
'cause I'ma coming.

55:59.898 --> 56:01.648
Where are you, Mr. Pocket?

56:03.401 --> 56:06.651
You to the left, to the right,
or straight up the middle?

56:09.783 --> 56:11.793
Well, we'll just have to see, won't we?

56:13.078 --> 56:14.448
We'll just have to see.

56:33.014 --> 56:34.394
Goodnight, Mr. Pocket.

56:37.102 --> 56:38.852
Sit tight, Mr. Pocket!

57:47.172 --> 57:48.472
Oh.

57:53.303 --> 57:54.303
Damn it.

58:06.357 --> 58:08.437
Well, maybe just one.

58:11.613 --> 58:13.663
How high can a bird count anyway?

58:52.987 --> 58:55.567
Hmm. Almost enough to keep.

59:27.480 --> 59:28.480
You're there.

59:29.816 --> 59:30.816
How deep?

59:57.719 --> 59:59.009
End of the line...

59:59.554 --> 01:00:01.394
and I'm gonna getcha.

01:00:01.889 --> 01:00:03.389
I'm gonna getcha.

01:00:03.474 --> 01:00:06.854
Maybe not today, but I'm gonna getcha.

01:00:08.396 --> 01:00:11.016
Can't run away from me now, Mr. Pocket.

01:00:12.692 --> 01:00:14.402
I catch up with you tomorrow.

01:00:15.987 --> 01:00:16.987
I'm old...

01:00:17.655 --> 01:00:18.775
but you're older.

01:00:20.408 --> 01:00:21.528
I'm old...

01:00:22.619 --> 01:00:23.869
but you're older.

01:00:27.999 --> 01:00:28.999
Yes, sir.

01:01:16.464 --> 01:01:17.764
Hmm.

01:01:18.174 --> 01:01:19.174
Keepers.

01:01:20.301 --> 01:01:21.511
Getting to keepers.

01:01:22.929 --> 01:01:24.309
All righty.

01:01:25.014 --> 01:01:26.274
Where's your daddy?

01:02:00.466 --> 01:02:03.086
Lumps and chunks. Lumps and chunks.

01:02:26.868 --> 01:02:28.158
Mother Machree.

01:02:42.884 --> 01:02:44.724
Hello, Mr. Pocket.

01:02:49.348 --> 01:02:51.058
Hello, Mr. Pocket!

01:06:15.221 --> 01:06:16.971
You measly skunk!

01:06:17.598 --> 01:06:19.678
You measly skunk!

01:06:20.059 --> 01:06:21.349
Camping on my trail!

01:06:22.019 --> 01:06:23.809
Letting me do all the work!

01:06:24.021 --> 01:06:26.021
And shooting me in the back!

01:06:26.482 --> 01:06:28.482
And shooting me in the back!

01:06:46.961 --> 01:06:48.631
You measly skunk.

01:06:49.588 --> 01:06:51.338
You shot me in the back!

01:07:02.560 --> 01:07:04.520
It went clean through.

01:07:04.854 --> 01:07:07.194
He didn't hit nothing important.

01:07:09.984 --> 01:07:13.034
He didn't hit nothing important.

01:07:13.279 --> 01:07:15.699
Nothing important.

01:07:16.615 --> 01:07:19.365
Just guts is all you had!

01:07:27.334 --> 01:07:28.884
Don't worry, Mr. Pocket.

01:07:30.504 --> 01:07:31.504
I'll be back.

01:07:33.215 --> 01:07:34.835
I ain't walking out on you.

01:08:28.187 --> 01:08:30.687
There's your share, you measly skunk.

01:08:38.113 --> 01:08:39.283
Come on, Lucky.

01:10:39.193 --> 01:10:40.953
I heard it through the walls.

01:10:41.028 --> 01:10:44.198
He made noises, strange noises,

01:10:44.281 --> 01:10:47.741
which he characterized as a cough.

01:10:47.826 --> 01:10:50.826
Frightening.
I've never heard such a cough.

01:10:50.913 --> 01:10:54.583
And this cough did to not respond
to any kind of syrup or elixir,

01:10:54.959 --> 01:10:57.249
and it was an extremely rattly cough.

01:10:57.336 --> 01:10:59.586
No, I was not sad
to see Mr. Kincaid leave.

01:10:59.713 --> 01:11:01.343
It was not a contagious cough.

01:11:01.882 --> 01:11:03.512
Nobody here became ill.

01:11:03.759 --> 01:11:05.339
It was a nervous cough.

01:11:05.594 --> 01:11:08.184
I would not rent to a contagious cougher.

01:11:08.639 --> 01:11:10.979
I've never heard of a nervous cough.

01:11:11.058 --> 01:11:13.228
I understand
that you are about to leave us.

01:11:13.310 --> 01:11:16.520
The nervous system spreads its tendrils
throughout the body.

01:11:16.605 --> 01:11:17.935
I saw a picture of it in a book.

01:11:18.023 --> 01:11:20.863
The nervous system
does not have tendrils.

01:11:20.943 --> 01:11:24.453
I don't pretend to be a physician
or a botanist,

01:11:24.530 --> 01:11:28.160
but I know the nervous system
extends through the body

01:11:28.242 --> 01:11:30.412
and I presume that is how it learns

01:11:30.494 --> 01:11:33.584
of the various physical conditions
that it imitates.

01:11:33.664 --> 01:11:36.504
Mrs. Flannery is quite right.
I've seen that picture.

01:11:36.583 --> 01:11:40.843
My point is only that Mr. Kincaid
was not a contagious cougher.

01:11:40.921 --> 01:11:44.431
- I don't rent to such.
- Is there any more chicken and dumplings?

01:11:44.842 --> 01:11:46.142
The bowl came to me last.

01:11:46.218 --> 01:11:49.388
Yes, there's more.
We don't stint at this table.

01:11:49.471 --> 01:11:51.721
Grandma Turner looks to be finished.

01:11:51.807 --> 01:11:53.927
Are you finished, Grandma Turner?

01:11:55.102 --> 01:11:56.272
Grandma Turner's finished.

01:11:56.729 --> 01:12:00.439
Leaving us tomorrow,
jumping off the map so to speak?

01:12:01.608 --> 01:12:05.608
Yes, indeed. My brother and I are
setting off in the morning for Oregon.

01:12:05.696 --> 01:12:08.066
Oregon?
Oh, you have people out there or are you...

01:12:08.157 --> 01:12:12.077
Just scoop from her plate, Mrs. Halliday.
Grandma Turner's quite done.

01:12:12.202 --> 01:12:14.792
No, I... Not exactly.

01:12:14.997 --> 01:12:16.417
That is, my brother does.

01:12:17.583 --> 01:12:20.093
Well, go ahead and tell him, Alice.
Don't be tongue-tied.

01:12:20.169 --> 01:12:21.709
She has exciting news.

01:12:22.004 --> 01:12:23.214
I...

01:12:24.798 --> 01:12:27.758
I'm to be married, or at least I may be

01:12:28.218 --> 01:12:29.758
to Gilbert's associate.

01:12:29.845 --> 01:12:31.175
He's well fixed out there.

01:12:32.014 --> 01:12:35.684
You are not certain
whether you are going to be married?

01:12:36.185 --> 01:12:39.015
Has the gentleman not proposed?

01:12:40.105 --> 01:12:42.515
He... Well, he...

01:12:43.400 --> 01:12:47.110
He will propose once they meet each other.
I'm sure Alice will pass muster.

01:12:47.613 --> 01:12:48.913
The match is a good one.

01:12:49.198 --> 01:12:51.528
I'm joining him in a business opportunity,

01:12:51.617 --> 01:12:54.787
and he's declared himself ready to marry
when he finds a suitable match.

01:12:54.870 --> 01:12:58.920
Alice can be very sociable and attractive
when she has a mind to be.

01:12:59.583 --> 01:13:01.383
She doesn't always have a mind to be.

01:13:01.460 --> 01:13:04.510
Well, I think she's just
the picture of charm.

01:13:04.588 --> 01:13:09.468
And we are going to miss you
so very much, Miss Longabaugh.

01:13:09.927 --> 01:13:11.637
You and Mr. Longabaugh both,

01:13:11.720 --> 01:13:14.930
and of course, Mr. Longabaugh's dog,

01:13:15.015 --> 01:13:18.055
little President Pierce. Bless him.

01:13:18.394 --> 01:13:20.404
Where... where is he now?

01:13:29.196 --> 01:13:30.196
Gilbert?

01:13:30.989 --> 01:13:31.989
Yes, sister?

01:13:32.991 --> 01:13:36.201
Two people have asked me
about President Pierce.

01:13:36.578 --> 01:13:37.578
Asked?

01:13:38.705 --> 01:13:41.035
Well... complained.

01:13:41.583 --> 01:13:42.583
About what?

01:13:44.211 --> 01:13:45.211
The barking.

01:13:46.338 --> 01:13:47.338
Indeed.

01:13:47.506 --> 01:13:48.506
Why to you?

01:13:50.342 --> 01:13:52.852
I believe they assumed he was my dog.

01:13:54.805 --> 01:13:57.885
Well, I don't know what to say.
President Pierce is a nervous creature

01:13:57.975 --> 01:14:00.435
and excited by animals larger
than himself.

01:14:01.311 --> 01:14:04.271
Almost all animals are larger
than President Pierce.

01:14:04.398 --> 01:14:05.518
Well, what of it?

01:14:06.817 --> 01:14:07.817
People are...

01:14:08.777 --> 01:14:11.987
wondering if he will bark
all the way to the Willamette Valley.

01:14:12.364 --> 01:14:13.494
What if he does?

01:14:13.740 --> 01:14:15.990
There are property rights.
The dog is my property.

01:14:16.076 --> 01:14:18.076
My property barks. There you have it.

01:14:19.079 --> 01:14:20.209
What did you tell them?

01:14:20.289 --> 01:14:21.289
Well...

01:14:21.915 --> 01:14:22.915
not that.

01:14:23.500 --> 01:14:25.500
Yes, I can only imagine what you said.

01:14:26.420 --> 01:14:28.500
Alice, sometimes you have to tell people
what's what.

01:15:20.891 --> 01:15:21.891
Ma'am.

01:15:25.729 --> 01:15:26.729
Miss?

01:15:29.691 --> 01:15:30.731
Condolences.

01:15:33.195 --> 01:15:34.235
Condolences.

01:15:35.155 --> 01:15:36.275
You going back?

01:15:38.492 --> 01:15:41.582
You... you going back now or... or...

01:15:41.912 --> 01:15:43.502
We lost him.

01:15:44.289 --> 01:15:46.629
I'm... so very sorry.

01:15:48.669 --> 01:15:50.749
- I will get a spade.
- Yesterday morning...

01:15:52.881 --> 01:15:54.051
he was fine.

01:15:55.884 --> 01:15:58.644
- It is very quick, cholera.
- She a go-backer?

01:15:59.179 --> 01:16:00.179
Um...

01:16:00.681 --> 01:16:02.221
Will you be going back, Miss?

01:16:02.599 --> 01:16:03.599
Or pressing on?

01:16:07.312 --> 01:16:09.652
Going back or staying with the train?

01:16:11.858 --> 01:16:13.188
Going back...

01:16:14.194 --> 01:16:15.194
where?

01:16:16.238 --> 01:16:17.238
Uh...

01:16:20.158 --> 01:16:22.328
I don't have people.

01:16:23.787 --> 01:16:24.787
Well...

01:16:27.666 --> 01:16:28.666
I'll get a spade.

01:16:46.143 --> 01:16:47.143
Uh...

01:16:48.478 --> 01:16:50.978
You want a marker of any kind or...?

01:16:55.402 --> 01:16:56.862
We'll leave off then.

01:16:59.406 --> 01:17:02.366
Better anyway not to advertise
to the Indians.

01:17:04.077 --> 01:17:05.697
Well, they don't bother us none.

01:17:06.079 --> 01:17:08.289
Too much trouble attacking a wagon train.

01:17:08.373 --> 01:17:10.673
But they will scavenge.

01:17:10.751 --> 01:17:13.841
Uh, you got a hired boy,
don't you, Miss Longabaugh?

01:17:14.713 --> 01:17:16.173
Yes. Matt.

01:17:17.507 --> 01:17:19.087
He'll handle your team.

01:17:20.093 --> 01:17:21.223
He has been.

01:17:22.846 --> 01:17:24.506
Gilbert did very little.

01:17:26.642 --> 01:17:29.602
- You call on myself or Mr. Arthur if you...
- Yah!

01:17:52.250 --> 01:17:54.170
- Miss?
- Please, don't stand.

01:17:57.005 --> 01:17:58.755
Could I ask your advice, Mr. Knapp?

01:17:59.174 --> 01:18:00.344
Certainly, Miss.

01:18:00.425 --> 01:18:03.505
Would you like some supper
or coffee with us?

01:18:03.595 --> 01:18:04.965
No, thank you.

01:18:06.973 --> 01:18:09.393
My hired boy, Matt,

01:18:10.686 --> 01:18:13.356
he told me that my brother promised him
half his wages

01:18:13.438 --> 01:18:14.858
when we get to Fort Laramie.

01:18:15.273 --> 01:18:18.033
- How much he say that was?
- Two hundred dollars.

01:18:18.485 --> 01:18:20.145
Two hundred dollars is half?

01:18:21.571 --> 01:18:22.571
Yes.

01:18:23.115 --> 01:18:25.405
And the other half
when we get to the Willamette Valley.

01:18:25.492 --> 01:18:29.202
- High price.
- It is an extravagant wage.

01:18:30.914 --> 01:18:31.914
Is it?

01:18:31.957 --> 01:18:34.957
- That's a high price.
- You think the boy's telling a story?

01:18:35.043 --> 01:18:36.923
Now that your brother is no longer...

01:18:38.088 --> 01:18:39.168
I don't know.

01:18:40.006 --> 01:18:42.216
Gilbert was not a good businessman.

01:18:43.593 --> 01:18:47.643
He had an enterprise in Iowa City
that ended poorly,

01:18:47.723 --> 01:18:49.433
and earlier, another that...

01:18:51.476 --> 01:18:52.846
He was a failure.

01:18:54.479 --> 01:18:55.769
That's a high price.

01:18:58.817 --> 01:19:00.437
Well, there is another problem.

01:19:00.694 --> 01:19:03.284
I cannot find any money in the wagon.

01:19:03.363 --> 01:19:05.873
I believe Gilbert kept it
in his waistcoat.

01:19:09.995 --> 01:19:11.285
Then he's still got it.

01:19:13.707 --> 01:19:15.127
A half-day's ride.

01:19:15.208 --> 01:19:16.418
Where to?

01:19:18.003 --> 01:19:19.423
How do we find him?

01:19:20.756 --> 01:19:22.086
Oh, I don't think so.

01:19:22.174 --> 01:19:25.764
I suggest you not argue
with the boy until we get to Fort Laramie.

01:19:26.344 --> 01:19:27.344
And then?

01:19:30.182 --> 01:19:31.182
Well...

01:19:32.225 --> 01:19:33.805
maybe I will talk to the boy.

01:19:34.311 --> 01:19:36.731
See if I can shake him loose
from his story.

01:19:38.523 --> 01:19:40.903
Four hundred dollars. I don't know.

01:19:41.568 --> 01:19:43.568
I will have to think on this one.

01:20:15.185 --> 01:20:18.145
Miss? Could I have a word?

01:20:18.230 --> 01:20:20.570
Certainly, Mr. Knapp.
Could I offer you supper?

01:20:20.982 --> 01:20:22.572
Well, thank you. I've had mine.

01:20:27.322 --> 01:20:28.912
This is awkward, Miss, but...

01:20:29.282 --> 01:20:33.252
people have complained to Mr. Arthur
and myself about your little, uh...

01:20:33.995 --> 01:20:35.155
President Pierce?

01:20:35.247 --> 01:20:37.667
- I have no doubt but that's your dog.
- He is not my dog.

01:20:38.416 --> 01:20:40.166
- Miss?
- He was...

01:20:40.710 --> 01:20:41.840
Mr. Longabaugh's.

01:20:41.920 --> 01:20:44.590
I know it's terrible, the noise.
I don't know what to do.

01:20:45.715 --> 01:20:47.505
Well then, I thought he was your dog.

01:20:48.218 --> 01:20:50.598
Maybe this is quite a simple matter. Uh...

01:20:51.304 --> 01:20:52.854
Can I put him down for you, Miss?

01:20:55.934 --> 01:21:00.194
All right. Well, could we not
just scare him off?

01:21:00.272 --> 01:21:01.942
Well, no.

01:21:02.023 --> 01:21:04.863
We are his food and he will follow us,
long as he can.

01:21:05.902 --> 01:21:08.322
And a wolf might play with him...

01:21:08.613 --> 01:21:09.613
uh...

01:21:09.865 --> 01:21:11.065
before he eats him.

01:21:11.408 --> 01:21:12.408
Faster is better.

01:21:12.534 --> 01:21:14.084
Yes. I understand.

01:21:16.663 --> 01:21:18.253
I will attend to it right away.

01:21:24.671 --> 01:21:25.671
Oh.

01:21:28.008 --> 01:21:29.588
I regret to have to tell you...

01:21:30.719 --> 01:21:32.469
I talked to your boy, Matt.

01:21:33.471 --> 01:21:35.271
I could not get him to budge.

01:21:36.808 --> 01:21:38.688
Thank you, Mr. Knapp. You are...

01:21:39.185 --> 01:21:41.055
very kind to extend yourself.

01:21:43.481 --> 01:21:44.901
Here we go, little dog.

01:22:38.912 --> 01:22:41.292
I set President Pierce down, and...

01:22:45.418 --> 01:22:46.628
Uh...

01:22:47.253 --> 01:22:49.133
he moved just as I fired.

01:22:51.466 --> 01:22:53.216
He skittered off, Miss. I...

01:22:54.678 --> 01:22:56.258
I don't believe I hit him at all.

01:22:57.097 --> 01:22:58.637
Oh, my God.

01:22:58.723 --> 01:23:00.733
I should have deputized Mr. Arthur.

01:23:01.101 --> 01:23:02.561
That man is a crack shot.

01:23:02.644 --> 01:23:05.114
- I didn't expect...
- Well, it was very kind of you.

01:23:08.108 --> 01:23:10.688
I do not think
you will see President Pierce again.

01:23:42.892 --> 01:23:45.102
I'm... I'm sorry to trouble you again.

01:23:46.229 --> 01:23:48.229
You're no trouble, Miss Longabaugh.

01:23:49.816 --> 01:23:52.276
I do apologize, Mr. Knapp.

01:23:53.194 --> 01:23:54.744
Interrupting your supper.

01:23:55.155 --> 01:23:57.235
Please, set your mind at ease, Miss.

01:23:57.699 --> 01:24:01.949
It is my duty to guide the train
and meet square any unexpected problem.

01:24:02.037 --> 01:24:04.207
Well, things are developing for the worse.

01:24:05.165 --> 01:24:06.995
- Yeah?
- My boy, Matt,

01:24:07.083 --> 01:24:10.343
has asked me to affirm
his arrangement with my brother.

01:24:10.587 --> 01:24:14.337
He asked me to declare he will receive
his two payments in Fort Laramie,

01:24:14.424 --> 01:24:15.434
and in Oregon.

01:24:16.092 --> 01:24:18.222
He says if I will not affirm it,
he will depart.

01:24:18.303 --> 01:24:21.143
He will join the first party
of go-backers we meet.

01:24:21.765 --> 01:24:22.805
And leave you.

01:24:23.558 --> 01:24:25.978
Leave you out here with the wagon
high and dry.

01:24:26.061 --> 01:24:27.061
Yes.

01:24:28.063 --> 01:24:29.523
Well, well, well.

01:24:29.606 --> 01:24:31.686
- Yes, but...
- Please, sit down, Miss. We...

01:24:32.776 --> 01:24:35.446
- We better talk about this.
- I don't like it.

01:24:36.321 --> 01:24:38.701
But I don't know
that it is wrong of him to ask.

01:24:39.282 --> 01:24:41.242
He is doing a job for pay.

01:24:42.118 --> 01:24:45.498
You are very broad-minded
to see the other side of it.

01:24:45.580 --> 01:24:47.580
But then what shall I do, Mr. Knapp?

01:24:48.625 --> 01:24:51.285
Shall I confess I have no money?
What is right?

01:24:53.004 --> 01:24:54.014
What is right?

01:24:59.427 --> 01:25:00.427
Miss Longabaugh...

01:25:01.387 --> 01:25:06.347
I cannot offer to drive your team
or tend your wagon in place of the boy.

01:25:06.434 --> 01:25:08.524
- Mr. Arthur...
- I would not ask you to do so.

01:25:08.603 --> 01:25:10.813
Oh, indeed.
These are my thoughts, not yours.

01:25:11.314 --> 01:25:15.194
Mr. Arthur and I have to ride
one in front of the train, one behind.

01:25:15.276 --> 01:25:18.396
We take turns, pilot and drag, but...

01:25:22.200 --> 01:25:23.950
Will you trust me for a day?

01:25:24.035 --> 01:25:25.745
Well, certainly. But how so?

01:25:27.205 --> 01:25:29.245
Tell the boy you affirm the agreement.

01:25:30.333 --> 01:25:32.043
I want to think on this for a day.

01:25:32.961 --> 01:25:36.841
I have a notion
that you may think is crackpot, but...

01:25:37.590 --> 01:25:39.010
I do not believe it is.

01:25:39.092 --> 01:25:40.802
I'm sure it is not crackpot.

01:25:41.678 --> 01:25:42.718
We'll see.

01:25:44.430 --> 01:25:45.470
Give me a day.

01:25:45.807 --> 01:25:47.177
I must talk to Mr. Arthur.

01:25:47.267 --> 01:25:49.097
Then we will talk tomorrow and...

01:25:49.894 --> 01:25:52.194
If you think it is a bad idea, well then,

01:25:52.647 --> 01:25:55.687
we will have only taken one extra day
of the boy's labor.

01:26:09.831 --> 01:26:10.961
Afternoon, partner.

01:26:11.291 --> 01:26:12.291
Mm-hmm.

01:26:16.212 --> 01:26:17.462
Which is worse, partner?

01:26:18.006 --> 01:26:19.126
Dust or mud?

01:26:21.009 --> 01:26:22.009
Both, I guess.

01:26:24.679 --> 01:26:26.389
Say...

01:26:26.472 --> 01:26:28.812
I was thinking of proposing
to Miss Longabaugh.

01:26:33.188 --> 01:26:34.188
That right?

01:26:34.355 --> 01:26:35.355
Yes, and...

01:26:36.149 --> 01:26:37.779
if she accepts, well then...

01:26:38.610 --> 01:26:40.450
I will settle in Oregon.

01:26:41.487 --> 01:26:43.197
This would be my last wagon train.

01:26:45.491 --> 01:26:47.331
I will farm.

01:26:53.082 --> 01:26:54.082
Well...

01:26:54.584 --> 01:26:56.044
we'll see how she takes it.

01:26:57.879 --> 01:26:59.959
Well, I guess I'll head back up.

01:27:00.048 --> 01:27:02.048
Unless you desire a swap.

01:27:02.592 --> 01:27:03.592
Nope.

01:27:05.762 --> 01:27:07.432
- Afternoon.
- Yep.

01:27:08.723 --> 01:27:09.813
Hep!

01:27:49.681 --> 01:27:51.891
- Miss.
- Good evening, Mr. Knapp.

01:27:53.059 --> 01:27:54.559
May we talk for a moment?

01:28:01.609 --> 01:28:03.359
So your crackpot notion?

01:28:03.736 --> 01:28:04.946
Yes.

01:28:06.364 --> 01:28:09.704
Before I expose it, may I ask something?

01:28:09.784 --> 01:28:10.914
Certainly.

01:28:10.994 --> 01:28:11.994
What...

01:28:12.537 --> 01:28:15.707
possibilities do you look forward to
in Oregon?

01:28:18.209 --> 01:28:19.419
I don't quite know.

01:28:21.129 --> 01:28:23.669
Gilbert knows... knew someone there.

01:28:24.382 --> 01:28:26.512
A Mr. Vereen who owns an orchard,

01:28:26.592 --> 01:28:30.512
or maybe more than one orchard,
and a cartage company.

01:28:31.556 --> 01:28:34.596
He was vague about his connection
with Mr. Vereen,

01:28:35.601 --> 01:28:38.651
and... and about his own
prospective position.

01:28:39.105 --> 01:28:42.105
I don't wish to slight
my brother's memory, but he could...

01:28:42.442 --> 01:28:45.742
exaggerate the nature of an opportunity.

01:28:46.154 --> 01:28:47.164
And...

01:28:47.780 --> 01:28:50.160
And Mr. Vereen's interest in myself...

01:28:52.618 --> 01:28:55.078
I fear that may also
have been speculative.

01:28:56.706 --> 01:28:58.366
I see.

01:28:58.499 --> 01:29:02.419
So, this is no definite
prospect of marriage.

01:29:02.503 --> 01:29:04.963
- No contract.
- I...

01:29:07.008 --> 01:29:08.008
No.

01:29:08.885 --> 01:29:09.885
Well...

01:29:12.180 --> 01:29:13.810
My idea then is this...

01:29:15.558 --> 01:29:17.978
And I submit it in respect,
Miss Longabaugh.

01:29:19.479 --> 01:29:23.939
I propose to assume your brother's debt
to the hired boy and to...

01:29:29.489 --> 01:29:31.199
to ask you to marry me.

01:29:37.830 --> 01:29:38.830
Oh.

01:29:40.291 --> 01:29:41.751
I submit it in respect.

01:29:45.213 --> 01:29:46.213
Oh.

01:29:49.008 --> 01:29:50.468
I have ambushed you.

01:29:52.178 --> 01:29:53.928
- I'm very sorry.
- No, no, no.

01:29:54.013 --> 01:29:56.723
I should clarify
what brings me to say these things,

01:29:56.808 --> 01:29:58.428
or I will seem like the veriest bounder.

01:29:58.976 --> 01:30:03.686
I found myself thinking
about certain matters. Um...

01:30:06.401 --> 01:30:08.441
I have been busting trail for 15 years.

01:30:08.986 --> 01:30:11.906
Last 12 with Mr. Arthur.
Mr. Arthur's a top man.

01:30:12.573 --> 01:30:16.413
Top man, but he is...
he is getting older.

01:30:17.120 --> 01:30:18.960
Slower to straighten in the morning.

01:30:19.997 --> 01:30:22.627
- Sleeping on the ground, Miss...
- Yes.

01:30:22.708 --> 01:30:25.708
To have no family
and to sleep on the ground...

01:30:25.837 --> 01:30:28.967
- Yes, it cannot be easy.
- Looking at him, well...

01:30:31.717 --> 01:30:35.297
I myself have come to the age
where either I will settle

01:30:35.388 --> 01:30:39.098
and have children
who can take care of me when I'm old

01:30:39.976 --> 01:30:40.976
or I will not.

01:30:41.894 --> 01:30:43.484
That time will have passed.

01:30:43.938 --> 01:30:44.978
Yes.

01:30:46.107 --> 01:30:48.647
So I found myself thinking, well...

01:30:49.610 --> 01:30:54.370
if I met a maiden or a widow of honor,

01:30:54.449 --> 01:30:55.449
uh...

01:30:56.159 --> 01:30:57.369
perhaps I would...

01:30:59.120 --> 01:31:00.910
- Yes.
- ...present myself...

01:31:00.997 --> 01:31:02.327
Yes, I understand.

01:31:02.623 --> 01:31:03.623
Uh...

01:31:04.667 --> 01:31:05.747
Yes.

01:31:10.923 --> 01:31:13.183
You're acquainted with the 1872 Grant?

01:31:15.678 --> 01:31:16.758
I am not.

01:31:17.305 --> 01:31:20.345
A settler in Oregon can claim 320 acres.

01:31:20.725 --> 01:31:24.395
A... married couple can claim 640.

01:31:26.189 --> 01:31:28.019
There is a, um...

01:31:29.317 --> 01:31:33.607
In Fort Laramie, there is a Mr. Bourgeois
who can sanctify marriage.

01:31:35.781 --> 01:31:37.871
Do you engage in divine worship?

01:31:38.743 --> 01:31:39.743
Yes.

01:31:40.286 --> 01:31:41.576
I am a Methodist.

01:31:42.497 --> 01:31:43.577
Yourself, Miss?

01:31:44.040 --> 01:31:45.670
I'm Episcopalian.

01:31:52.507 --> 01:31:55.007
What is your Christian name, Mr. Knapp?

01:31:56.177 --> 01:31:57.597
Uh, William.

01:31:58.513 --> 01:31:59.893
I am Billy Knapp.

01:32:00.806 --> 01:32:02.476
I am Alice Longabaugh.

01:32:05.811 --> 01:32:07.941
Now I suppose it is my turn to think.

01:32:08.481 --> 01:32:09.481
Of course.

01:32:09.899 --> 01:32:10.899
We will, um...

01:32:11.817 --> 01:32:13.987
We will let the boy keep working then?

01:32:14.779 --> 01:32:16.489
On his assumption of payment?

01:32:25.206 --> 01:32:28.126
- What are you doing, Israel?
- Walking backwards.

01:32:28.501 --> 01:32:31.171
Going to walk the rest of the way
to Oregon backwards.

01:32:31.587 --> 01:32:33.257
- Don't do that.
- Why not?

01:32:33.339 --> 01:32:34.799
I said don't do that.

01:32:35.508 --> 01:32:36.928
Don't do that!

01:32:53.025 --> 01:32:54.025
Noon here!

01:33:07.415 --> 01:33:08.995
Thank you.

01:33:34.275 --> 01:33:36.525
Best not to get too far
from the train, Miss.

01:33:38.321 --> 01:33:39.991
It's like the ocean out here.

01:33:40.823 --> 01:33:42.953
Easy to get lost, Miss.

01:33:44.410 --> 01:33:46.330
I thought I should add...

01:33:46.412 --> 01:33:49.122
Alice, lest I seem hard-nosed...

01:33:50.791 --> 01:33:53.171
If you see fit to decline my proposal,
why....

01:33:54.295 --> 01:33:56.085
there's more than one way to skin a cat.

01:33:56.547 --> 01:33:59.007
We might find a boy from another wagon
to drive your team,

01:33:59.091 --> 01:34:01.091
use your oxen as payment.

01:34:01.677 --> 01:34:04.427
We will get you to Oregon, safe and sound.

01:34:05.431 --> 01:34:08.521
I don't wish to present myself
as the only alternative to ruin this.

01:34:08.601 --> 01:34:10.771
But I'm inclined to accept your proposal.

01:34:14.106 --> 01:34:15.146
All right.

01:34:15.232 --> 01:34:17.442
And I don't take yourself
to be hard-nosed.

01:34:20.571 --> 01:34:21.451
All right.

01:34:21.530 --> 01:34:24.120
My dear brother was very hard-nosed.

01:34:25.493 --> 01:34:27.163
But never very successful.

01:34:27.745 --> 01:34:29.245
It was frustrating for him.

01:34:29.538 --> 01:34:32.038
- I'm very sorry you have lost him.
- Yes.

01:34:33.084 --> 01:34:34.464
But he is with his creator.

01:34:35.961 --> 01:34:37.051
His way is easy now.

01:34:37.213 --> 01:34:39.473
Yes, his way was difficult.

01:34:41.592 --> 01:34:44.852
I must say,
it was difficult to be with him.

01:34:45.346 --> 01:34:47.716
I was very nervous being with him.

01:34:49.016 --> 01:34:52.056
Not afraid of him.
He would not hurt a fly. I was just...

01:34:53.771 --> 01:34:54.941
not at ease.

01:34:56.023 --> 01:35:00.573
I was eaten up by nerves at the thought
of talking to Mr. Vereen, for instance.

01:35:04.198 --> 01:35:05.368
And yet, you...

01:35:06.951 --> 01:35:08.951
are so very easy to talk to.

01:35:12.415 --> 01:35:14.245
Perhaps we'll find comfort together.

01:35:15.710 --> 01:35:18.050
I had hoped for that as well.

01:35:19.588 --> 01:35:20.918
Yes, William.

01:35:23.426 --> 01:35:26.966
Come on, boys! Push harder!

01:35:29.056 --> 01:35:30.056
Come on!

01:35:47.616 --> 01:35:49.616
Well, it...

01:35:54.957 --> 01:35:56.877
It appears Miss Longabaugh is...

01:35:57.793 --> 01:35:59.843
inclined to accept my proposal.

01:36:10.347 --> 01:36:11.467
Mm-hmm.

01:36:14.143 --> 01:36:16.693
Of course, you will do fine solo.

01:36:17.605 --> 01:36:20.855
No doubt about it. Man of your skills
will always be in high demand.

01:36:20.941 --> 01:36:22.491
Where the hell is that hobble?

01:36:24.570 --> 01:36:26.320
Oh, never mind. Here it is.

01:36:35.456 --> 01:36:36.866
That man is a wonder.

01:36:38.209 --> 01:36:40.339
Well, he can read the prairie like a book.

01:36:41.128 --> 01:36:42.708
To see him cut for sign, well,

01:36:43.088 --> 01:36:45.628
you'd think the good Lord
dealt us each our five senses

01:36:45.716 --> 01:36:47.796
and bottom dealt Mr. Arthur one extra.

01:36:48.219 --> 01:36:49.219
Hmm.

01:36:49.970 --> 01:36:52.350
Still... he is old.

01:36:54.099 --> 01:36:56.269
I don't know how it'll go for him.

01:36:56.852 --> 01:36:58.852
I can't help feeling in the wrong.

01:37:00.105 --> 01:37:02.525
Your first responsibility
is to your household.

01:37:03.234 --> 01:37:05.244
- Yes, but...
- I'm sorry.

01:37:05.319 --> 01:37:07.779
I should not dismiss it
with an easy apothegm.

01:37:08.489 --> 01:37:12.159
- Yes.
- Gilbert had a saying for any situation.

01:37:12.493 --> 01:37:14.203
A ready bit of wisdom.

01:37:16.413 --> 01:37:18.173
He was very certain.

01:37:18.249 --> 01:37:19.669
He was a doughface?

01:37:20.376 --> 01:37:22.416
How did... Oh!

01:37:22.878 --> 01:37:26.838
Yes. He was an admirer
of President Pierce, yes.

01:37:27.842 --> 01:37:30.222
He had fixed political beliefs.

01:37:31.095 --> 01:37:33.255
All of his beliefs were quite fixed.

01:37:34.682 --> 01:37:37.602
He would upbraid me for being wishy-washy.

01:37:39.854 --> 01:37:41.694
I never had his certainties.

01:37:42.439 --> 01:37:44.149
I suppose it is a defect.

01:37:44.233 --> 01:37:46.073
I don't think it's a defect at all.

01:37:47.611 --> 01:37:48.611
Oh, no.

01:37:50.406 --> 01:37:51.526
Uncertainty...

01:37:52.908 --> 01:37:55.198
That is appropriate
for matters of this world.

01:37:56.495 --> 01:37:59.115
Only regarding the next
are we vouchsafed certainty.

01:37:59.707 --> 01:38:00.707
Yes.

01:38:01.292 --> 01:38:05.672
I believe certainty regarding
that which we can see and touch,

01:38:05.754 --> 01:38:08.764
it is seldom justified, if ever.

01:38:09.758 --> 01:38:13.678
Down the ages, from our remote past,

01:38:13.762 --> 01:38:15.472
what certainties survive?

01:38:16.557 --> 01:38:20.057
And yet we hurry to fashion new ones.

01:38:21.604 --> 01:38:22.864
Wanting their comfort.

01:38:24.690 --> 01:38:25.690
Certainty...

01:38:28.694 --> 01:38:30.154
...is the easy path.

01:38:31.655 --> 01:38:32.865
Just as you said.

01:38:38.495 --> 01:38:40.115
"Straight is the gate..."

01:38:42.666 --> 01:38:44.166
"And narrow the way."

01:38:46.170 --> 01:38:47.170
Indeed.

01:38:50.090 --> 01:38:51.180
Indeed.

01:38:59.350 --> 01:39:00.520
Sign, Mr. Arthur?

01:39:01.894 --> 01:39:02.894
Horses.

01:39:03.187 --> 01:39:04.517
You keep on.

01:39:05.606 --> 01:39:06.856
Gonna talk to Mr. Knapp.

01:39:19.828 --> 01:39:21.618
- Hey!
- Whoa! Whoa!

01:39:22.748 --> 01:39:24.118
Where's the woman?

01:39:24.625 --> 01:39:25.625
Huh?

01:39:26.085 --> 01:39:27.745
Miss Longabaugh. Where is she?

01:39:28.587 --> 01:39:29.457
Went over there.

01:39:29.546 --> 01:39:31.216
Over there? Why's that?

01:39:32.007 --> 01:39:34.757
I don't know. Heard that mutt barking.
President Pierce.

01:39:36.679 --> 01:39:39.849
Hah! Hah! Yah, yah, yah! Yah!

01:39:42.935 --> 01:39:43.935
Yah!

01:40:51.670 --> 01:40:54.760
- What are they, Mr. Arthur?
- Prairie dogs, ma'am.

01:40:54.840 --> 01:40:57.970
- Aren't they darling? I believe...
- Ma'am, we best, uh...

01:40:58.052 --> 01:41:01.852
President Pierce is trying to understand
what those creatures are,

01:41:01.930 --> 01:41:05.140
whether they're squirrels
and he should try to chase them,

01:41:05.225 --> 01:41:07.555
- or if they're other dogs.
- Get down.

01:41:08.270 --> 01:41:09.980
- Mr. Arthur?
- Get down now, Miss.

01:41:10.064 --> 01:41:11.774
- Get down!
- Mr. Arthur!

01:41:13.442 --> 01:41:15.112
Sit down below that rise there.

01:41:15.402 --> 01:41:16.572
But aren't...

01:41:17.404 --> 01:41:19.414
Just do as I say.

01:41:19.490 --> 01:41:21.330
- We aren't going back?
- Not directly.

01:41:45.182 --> 01:41:46.272
We're in for a fight.

01:41:47.017 --> 01:41:48.727
He won't answer my peace sign.

01:41:49.645 --> 01:41:52.355
And we can't make a run for it
through this dog-town.

01:41:54.399 --> 01:41:56.069
There's only one savage.

01:41:59.029 --> 01:42:00.739
Yeah, you keep looking.

01:42:05.786 --> 01:42:08.826
It's a war party and we probably
look like easy pickin's.

01:42:09.039 --> 01:42:11.669
What they'll do, they'll rush us.

01:42:12.960 --> 01:42:15.550
'Course dog holes
is as bad for them as for us,

01:42:15.921 --> 01:42:17.591
and they don't know how to fight.

01:42:18.006 --> 01:42:20.546
If they was to come front and back,
I couldn't handle them,

01:42:20.634 --> 01:42:23.604
but they rush in a bunch,
like damn fools.

01:42:24.304 --> 01:42:26.474
I beg your pardon, Miss.
Now you keep low here.

01:42:26.974 --> 01:42:27.974
Take this.

01:42:28.350 --> 01:42:30.640
- No.
- Take it. Take it now.

01:42:30.727 --> 01:42:33.267
Got two bullets in it.
It ain't for shooting Indians.

01:42:33.355 --> 01:42:34.765
If I see we're licked,

01:42:34.857 --> 01:42:37.687
I'm gonna shoot you and then
I'm gonna shoot myself, so that's okay.

01:42:37.776 --> 01:42:39.776
But if you see that I'm done for,

01:42:39.862 --> 01:42:41.662
well, you're gonna have to do
for yourself.

01:42:42.239 --> 01:42:46.539
Now you put it right there
so's you can't miss.

01:42:46.618 --> 01:42:49.868
- No, no, no, no, no!
- This is business, Miss Longabaugh.

01:42:49.955 --> 01:42:52.165
If they catch you, it won't be so good.

01:42:52.249 --> 01:42:54.289
After they take off
every stitch of your clothes

01:42:54.376 --> 01:42:55.536
and have their way with you,

01:42:55.627 --> 01:42:57.417
they'll stretch you out with a rawhide,

01:42:57.504 --> 01:43:00.567
and then they'll drive a stake through
the middle of your body into the ground

01:43:00.591 --> 01:43:04.261
and then they'll do some other things,
and we can't have that.

01:43:04.344 --> 01:43:05.854
Now, we ain't licked yet.

01:43:06.805 --> 01:43:07.805
But if we are...

01:43:09.600 --> 01:43:11.060
you know what to do.

01:43:14.104 --> 01:43:17.274
That's supposed to scare us.

01:43:17.482 --> 01:43:19.532
Won't bother us none, will it, Miss?

01:43:19.610 --> 01:43:20.740
No, Mr. Arthur.

01:43:21.153 --> 01:43:23.743
That Indian in the middle there...
he's the mucky muck,

01:43:23.822 --> 01:43:26.282
and if I shoot him,
well, that's bad medicine,

01:43:26.366 --> 01:43:29.196
and I think they'll all lose their spit
and light out.

01:43:29.536 --> 01:43:33.116
Anyway, we're gonna have us a good fight.

01:43:46.470 --> 01:43:47.600
Dog hole!

01:43:56.897 --> 01:43:57.937
Dog hole!

01:43:58.023 --> 01:43:59.023
Ha!

01:44:40.983 --> 01:44:42.903
They got the lay of the land now.

01:44:45.529 --> 01:44:46.529
Yah!

01:44:47.698 --> 01:44:49.698
This time they'll come with a purpose.

01:44:50.492 --> 01:44:51.952
You all right, Miss?

01:44:52.035 --> 01:44:53.405
Yes, Mr. Arthur.

01:44:56.123 --> 01:44:58.173
They ain't gonna do this all day.

01:44:59.918 --> 01:45:01.378
This'll tell the tale.

01:45:23.567 --> 01:45:24.567
Come on.

01:45:49.343 --> 01:45:51.353
- Mr. Arthur?
- Hold on, Miss.

01:46:46.233 --> 01:46:47.613
Oh, my.

01:46:56.326 --> 01:46:57.656
Poor little gal.

01:46:59.788 --> 01:47:01.498
She hadn't ought to have did it.

01:47:16.763 --> 01:47:18.063
Oh, my.

01:49:10.210 --> 01:49:12.750
Oh!

01:49:13.421 --> 01:49:16.301
Oh, I am sorry.
Didn't mean to wake you, sir.

01:49:18.385 --> 01:49:19.885
You did not wake me.

01:49:21.513 --> 01:49:22.973
For I was not asleep.

01:49:23.056 --> 01:49:25.556
Oh? Not asleep. I see.

01:49:25.892 --> 01:49:28.732
I apologize for disturbing anyone else
if I did.

01:49:31.898 --> 01:49:33.438
How much to go, you reckon?

01:49:33.525 --> 01:49:36.855
Oh, not a great distance.
Not great at all. We're making good time.

01:49:36.945 --> 01:49:39.405
You haven't been to Fort Morgan before,
I take it.

01:49:39.489 --> 01:49:41.449
Me? No.

01:49:42.284 --> 01:49:45.164
- You?
- Oh, yes, many times. Many times.

01:49:45.662 --> 01:49:46.832
Ferrying cargo.

01:49:50.584 --> 01:49:51.584
Him's yourn?

01:49:52.586 --> 01:49:54.626
As much as he's anyone's.

01:49:54.713 --> 01:49:56.883
- Isn't he, Clarence?
- As much as anyone's.

01:49:57.757 --> 01:50:00.677
- A loved one?
- By somebody, perhaps.

01:50:01.261 --> 01:50:02.641
You did not know him?

01:50:02.846 --> 01:50:05.266
We knew him only at the end.

01:50:08.685 --> 01:50:11.515
No, I have not been to Fort Morgan.

01:50:11.605 --> 01:50:13.265
I know little of cities.

01:50:13.356 --> 01:50:16.896
I'm a trapper living alone mostly
in these last years,

01:50:16.985 --> 01:50:20.855
but I would descend into town
every so often with my pelts.

01:50:21.197 --> 01:50:24.327
Uh, sell them and talk.
Keep my hand in talk.

01:50:24.409 --> 01:50:27.749
You gotta keep your hand in talking
even if you live in the wild.

01:50:27.829 --> 01:50:28.869
It's true. Practice.

01:50:28.955 --> 01:50:31.495
In town, I would talk to them
was interested.

01:50:31.583 --> 01:50:35.843
Saloon mostly, till they asked me
to take my business elsewhere.

01:50:36.004 --> 01:50:39.764
What kind of sense that make?
There was only the one saloon.

01:50:40.383 --> 01:50:42.973
Keeper called me tedious.

01:50:43.053 --> 01:50:44.513
Tedious! Me.

01:50:44.679 --> 01:50:47.519
If tidings from the greater world
are tedious,

01:50:47.599 --> 01:50:49.769
I would descend from the mountains,

01:50:49.851 --> 01:50:53.191
not having talked for many months,
with much to tell.

01:50:53.271 --> 01:50:55.901
Much to tell, having stored considerable.

01:50:55.982 --> 01:50:59.532
Though for many years,
I did not live alone in the wild.

01:50:59.611 --> 01:51:01.701
I did have a consort,

01:51:01.780 --> 01:51:03.990
a stout woman of the Hunkpapa Sioux.

01:51:04.074 --> 01:51:06.374
We had a companionship of sorts.

01:51:06.910 --> 01:51:08.910
But there is a lady present.

01:51:08.995 --> 01:51:12.615
A life together marked
by the passing of the seasons

01:51:12.707 --> 01:51:15.287
and the corresponding travels of game.

01:51:15.377 --> 01:51:17.627
In the latter,
she took very little interest.

01:51:17.712 --> 01:51:20.382
Well, her duties was domestic.

01:51:20.465 --> 01:51:22.375
I would track and trap,

01:51:22.467 --> 01:51:24.427
and she would terry hearthside.

01:51:24.511 --> 01:51:25.721
We did not talk.

01:51:25.804 --> 01:51:31.144
She had no English and I am not schooled
in the gibberings of the nations.

01:51:31.226 --> 01:51:32.886
Well, I say we did not talk,

01:51:32.977 --> 01:51:36.187
but sometimes we would, often at length,

01:51:36.272 --> 01:51:40.532
each in own tongue without benefit
of understanding the other.

01:51:40.610 --> 01:51:43.490
But the sound of a human voice
is a comfort

01:51:43.571 --> 01:51:45.411
when you're cabined up in the woods

01:51:45.490 --> 01:51:48.910
and all'd otherwise be
but the murmur of wind

01:51:48.993 --> 01:51:52.503
and the clop of snow
from an overloaded branch.

01:51:52.580 --> 01:51:54.870
Well, I said
"not understanding each other,"

01:51:54.958 --> 01:51:57.128
but it weren't entirely so.

01:51:57.293 --> 01:52:00.553
I could often read by means
of the tenure of her speech

01:52:00.630 --> 01:52:02.800
or certain facial expressions,

01:52:02.882 --> 01:52:05.842
the emotional import
of what she was saying.

01:52:05.927 --> 01:52:08.257
And she was often vexed with me.

01:52:08.346 --> 01:52:09.716
I seldom knew why.

01:52:10.056 --> 01:52:11.926
And then she moved on.

01:52:17.480 --> 01:52:18.400
Did you love her?

01:52:18.481 --> 01:52:19.771
Oh, I don't know.

01:52:19.858 --> 01:52:22.688
I never even knew her name,
but I will say this.

01:52:22.777 --> 01:52:27.817
The nature of them vocal intonations
and the play of feeling upon her face

01:52:28.408 --> 01:52:30.118
helped me to gather that, uh...

01:52:31.035 --> 01:52:33.365
people are like ferrets, or a beaver.

01:52:33.788 --> 01:52:35.248
All pretty much alike.

01:52:35.457 --> 01:52:36.707
Yeah, one like the next.

01:52:36.916 --> 01:52:39.706
I don't doubt it's the same
even if you travel to Siam.

01:52:39.919 --> 01:52:41.459
People are not the same.

01:52:41.880 --> 01:52:44.590
There are two kinds,
utterly distinct.

01:52:44.883 --> 01:52:46.383
And what would those be, madame?

01:52:46.468 --> 01:52:49.638
- Lucky and unlucky?
- No, hale and frail.

01:52:50.096 --> 01:52:52.846
Difficult to knock to the floor,
or wilting.

01:52:52.932 --> 01:52:56.192
Those are not the two kinds.
You well know the two kinds.

01:52:56.269 --> 01:52:58.309
One kind. Ain't no two kinds.

01:52:58.396 --> 01:53:00.316
Unless you mean trapper and townsman.

01:53:00.398 --> 01:53:01.938
Upright and sinning.

01:53:02.317 --> 01:53:03.397
Don't be a fool.

01:53:03.485 --> 01:53:05.195
Fool? Oh, yes.

01:53:05.278 --> 01:53:07.658
I know, "tedious fool."

01:53:07.864 --> 01:53:10.414
You're not the first
to lodge that complaint.

01:53:10.492 --> 01:53:13.162
I challenge your credentials, madam,

01:53:13.244 --> 01:53:14.664
for assessing human worth.

01:53:14.746 --> 01:53:16.326
People are like ferrets.

01:53:16.456 --> 01:53:17.916
People are not like ferrets,

01:53:17.999 --> 01:53:22.669
and I speak not on my own authority,
but on that of the Holy Bible.

01:53:22.754 --> 01:53:25.094
And here I speak on high authority.

01:53:25.173 --> 01:53:28.383
My husband, Dr. Betjeman, was an expert,

01:53:28.510 --> 01:53:33.310
a lecturer at the Chautauqua
on moral and spiritual hygiene,

01:53:33.389 --> 01:53:34.809
- now retired.
- Moral hygiene...

01:53:34.891 --> 01:53:37.101
I have the benefit of his insights.

01:53:37.435 --> 01:53:39.765
His lectures were spectacularly attended.

01:53:40.313 --> 01:53:45.153
He was... He is considered an expert
on spiritual betterment.

01:53:46.903 --> 01:53:48.113
Jacob's ladder?

01:53:49.030 --> 01:53:50.030
Betterment?

01:53:50.907 --> 01:53:53.577
But I don't suppose you have ever
been much occupied

01:53:53.701 --> 01:53:55.371
with the betterment of your soul.

01:53:55.453 --> 01:53:58.293
Well, I'm not an enemy of betterment,

01:53:58.832 --> 01:54:02.792
but I am kept very busy with my traps.

01:54:05.463 --> 01:54:06.973
Your husband isn't with you.

01:54:08.216 --> 01:54:10.176
We have been separated for some time.

01:54:11.094 --> 01:54:13.264
He has been... East.

01:54:13.805 --> 01:54:17.135
Illness has kept him,
but now we shall be reunited.

01:54:17.684 --> 01:54:21.024
- It will be a great joy.
- He awaits you in Fort Morgan?

01:54:21.271 --> 01:54:25.981
Yes. I have been living with my daughter
and son-in-law these last three years.

01:54:26.401 --> 01:54:28.901
Parents should not burden
the household of the child.

01:54:28.987 --> 01:54:30.357
This was wrong of you, madame.

01:54:30.488 --> 01:54:31.908
I was not a burden.

01:54:32.156 --> 01:54:35.366
- I was welcome in my daughter's house.
- Oh, she would say so, of course,

01:54:35.451 --> 01:54:38.331
but no doubt you could read
in her facial expression,

01:54:38.413 --> 01:54:43.253
as pointed out by the tedious man,
that your presence was not wanted.

01:54:43.793 --> 01:54:45.463
We each have a life.

01:54:45.587 --> 01:54:48.967
Each a life only our own.

01:54:49.424 --> 01:54:51.634
You know nothing of me
or my domestic affairs.

01:54:51.718 --> 01:54:55.178
I know that we must each
spin our own wheel and play our own hand.

01:54:55.263 --> 01:54:59.103
I was once at cards
with a man named Cipolski.

01:54:59.183 --> 01:55:01.393
- This was very many years ago...
- He a Polack?

01:55:02.729 --> 01:55:05.649
- He was Polonais, oui. And we...
- I knew a Polack.

01:55:07.817 --> 01:55:08.897
We were at cards.

01:55:09.277 --> 01:55:12.657
My hand was poor, I folded,
but Cipolski and four others remained.

01:55:12.739 --> 01:55:15.619
Cipolski said to me,
"René, I am in distress.

01:55:15.700 --> 01:55:17.790
You must play for me
while I perform mes nécessités."

01:55:17.869 --> 01:55:19.039
My necessaries.

01:55:19.704 --> 01:55:22.584
I said, "Friend, no.
I cannot wager for you."

01:55:22.665 --> 01:55:24.745
He said, "Of course you can.
We know each other well.

01:55:24.834 --> 01:55:26.344
You wager as I would do."

01:55:27.086 --> 01:55:29.376
I say, this is quite impossible, no?

01:55:29.797 --> 01:55:33.797
How a man wager,
it is decided by who he is,

01:55:34.177 --> 01:55:38.807
by the entirety of his relation to poker,
right up until the moment of that bet.

01:55:39.015 --> 01:55:41.225
I cannot bet for you. Pourquoi pas?

01:55:41.309 --> 01:55:45.609
I cannot know you, not to this degree.

01:55:45.688 --> 01:55:47.978
We must each play our own hand.

01:55:48.107 --> 01:55:50.277
"No, Cipolski." I say, "No.

01:55:50.610 --> 01:55:54.070
We may call each other friend,
but we cannot know each other so."

01:55:54.155 --> 01:55:57.115
You can know him. People are like ferrets.

01:55:57.200 --> 01:56:00.580
- People are not like ferrets!
- You misunderstand, mon vieux.

01:56:00.787 --> 01:56:02.957
We can know each other, oui,
to a certain level,

01:56:03.039 --> 01:56:04.959
but to know entire, impossible.

01:56:07.085 --> 01:56:08.875
- Poker is a gambling game.
- Mmm.

01:56:09.087 --> 01:56:12.757
You have pursued a life
of vice and dissipation

01:56:12.840 --> 01:56:15.470
and you are no doubt expert
in such pursuits,

01:56:15.760 --> 01:56:19.470
but no conclusions drawn
from such an existence

01:56:19.555 --> 01:56:21.715
will apply to a life rightly lived.

01:56:21.808 --> 01:56:23.098
Life is life.

01:56:23.393 --> 01:56:25.903
Cards will teach you
what you need to know.

01:56:25.979 --> 01:56:29.859
You, madame, you speak of your life
with your husband, who awaits,

01:56:29.941 --> 01:56:33.951
and you fly to him with the certainty
he loves you as he did three years ago.

01:56:34.320 --> 01:56:36.030
Bon, three years.

01:56:36.489 --> 01:56:40.159
There was a flame.
You do not know there is.

01:56:40.493 --> 01:56:43.413
Among decent people,
relations are eternal.

01:56:44.163 --> 01:56:47.633
Decent people stay true...
to others, to themselves.

01:56:47.709 --> 01:56:50.249
- Life is change.
- Presumptuous man.

01:56:50.336 --> 01:56:51.916
You say my daughter doesn't love me,

01:56:52.005 --> 01:56:54.755
- that my husband no longer does...
- If he ever did.

01:56:54.841 --> 01:56:56.381
No offense, madame.

01:56:56.467 --> 01:56:59.467
My point is that we can never know,
not to the deepest level.

01:56:59.554 --> 01:57:03.394
And the word "love,"
well, it can have different meanings, no?

01:57:03.474 --> 01:57:06.274
- Now hold on there, mister.
- I know what love means!

01:57:06.352 --> 01:57:09.862
Your husband was a lecturer, oui,
he was an educator.

01:57:09.939 --> 01:57:11.729
Would you say he was a man of charisma?

01:57:11.816 --> 01:57:12.936
He was. He is!

01:57:13.026 --> 01:57:16.196
Bon, love would mean something
quite different to such a person

01:57:16.279 --> 01:57:17.659
who commands the love of the crowd

01:57:17.739 --> 01:57:21.579
than it would to a person who can
only coax love through subservience.

01:57:21.784 --> 01:57:25.714
I did not coax love from Dr. Betjeman.

01:57:25.788 --> 01:57:27.458
I am not a wheedler.

01:57:27.582 --> 01:57:30.252
My husband's love was freely given,
and endures.

01:57:30.334 --> 01:57:33.634
His love was different from yours,
it's all I say.

01:57:34.047 --> 01:57:36.967
The person widely admired
accepts love as a tribute

01:57:37.050 --> 01:57:39.970
and he confers his own love as an honor,

01:57:40.053 --> 01:57:43.393
for, coming from him,
it must have great worth.

01:57:43.473 --> 01:57:47.853
But you, madame, you would not
receive this gift splendidly

01:57:47.935 --> 01:57:51.225
as one who has no need,
but you would grasp it as a beggar!

01:57:51.314 --> 01:57:52.984
- Ain't no call for that!
- How dare you!

01:57:53.066 --> 01:57:54.936
Of course the great man, the admired man,

01:57:55.026 --> 01:57:58.106
he might well accept other loves,
simply as his due,

01:57:58.196 --> 01:57:59.566
from some of those who admire him.

01:57:59.655 --> 01:58:01.945
And why not, if the admirer's comely?

01:58:02.033 --> 01:58:05.833
It is a love of a different kind,
of course, than the domestique.

01:58:06.454 --> 01:58:09.004
- But in France, we say...
- You...

01:58:09.082 --> 01:58:11.632
- You deplorable...
- Ease up there now, lady!

01:58:11.709 --> 01:58:14.549
- You depraved...
- Take it easy. He's just a Frenchman!

01:58:16.714 --> 01:58:19.224
You've given her a fit, Frenchie!

01:58:19.300 --> 01:58:21.470
- We must stop the coach!
- Coachman won't stop.

01:58:21.552 --> 01:58:23.642
He must stop. We are the passengers!

01:58:23.721 --> 01:58:25.601
- Coachman won't stop.
- We must stop. Coachman!

01:58:28.309 --> 01:58:29.309
Coachman!

01:58:29.393 --> 01:58:31.063
Coachman, I say!

01:58:31.145 --> 01:58:33.105
We must stop!

01:58:33.523 --> 01:58:36.113
Coachman! Coach... Merde.

01:58:37.652 --> 01:58:38.652
He will not stop.

01:58:38.736 --> 01:58:40.146
He never stops. Policy.

01:58:40.780 --> 01:58:42.990
You're all right. You're all right, miss.

01:58:43.199 --> 01:58:46.039
Please... stop doing that.

02:01:13.307 --> 02:01:14.347
I am sorry.

02:01:14.725 --> 02:01:15.935
I do apologize.

02:01:16.018 --> 02:01:19.188
He sings it every trip.
Always does this to me.

02:01:22.900 --> 02:01:25.740
You'd think with the business we're in,

02:01:25.820 --> 02:01:27.070
I wouldn't be so...

02:01:27.989 --> 02:01:29.409
What is your business?

02:01:29.740 --> 02:01:30.740
Well...

02:01:31.993 --> 02:01:33.543
I like to say that we're...

02:01:33.869 --> 02:01:36.409
- reapers.
- Harvesters of souls.

02:01:36.497 --> 02:01:39.917
We help people
who have been adjudged to be ripe.

02:01:40.501 --> 02:01:43.211
- You're bounty hunters.
- Literal man!

02:01:43.337 --> 02:01:47.167
Cruel man! Yes, fine. Bounty hunters.

02:01:47.258 --> 02:01:50.678
An ugly title.
As if emolument were the point.

02:01:50.761 --> 02:01:53.351
Is the cobbler not paid for his shoes?

02:01:53.431 --> 02:01:55.771
- It's an honest calling.
- So, uh...

02:01:56.017 --> 02:01:57.807
him on the roof, he was wanted?

02:01:58.394 --> 02:02:01.194
Oh, Mr. Thorpe was very much wanted,

02:02:01.272 --> 02:02:03.482
judging by what they're paying for him.

02:02:03.566 --> 02:02:06.856
- What'd he do?
- Oh, I don't know. Does it matter?

02:02:07.361 --> 02:02:09.991
Just as you said, madame,
there are two kinds of people.

02:02:10.364 --> 02:02:13.204
In our business, they are dead or alive.

02:02:13.534 --> 02:02:15.754
So you will take them alive?

02:02:15.828 --> 02:02:16.908
I didn't say that.

02:02:18.581 --> 02:02:20.881
Neither do I take them alive.

02:02:20.958 --> 02:02:23.838
'Course, it's entirely different business,
and I work alone.

02:02:23.919 --> 02:02:26.959
Yes, well, we're a duo, a tandem, a team.

02:02:27.590 --> 02:02:30.050
They're so easily taken
when they're distracted, people are.

02:02:30.134 --> 02:02:33.554
So, I'm the distractor
with a little story,

02:02:33.637 --> 02:02:36.177
a little conversation, a song, a sparkle.

02:02:36.891 --> 02:02:39.351
And Clarence does the thumping
while their attention is on me.

02:02:39.435 --> 02:02:41.015
He's very good, this one.

02:02:41.103 --> 02:02:42.903
- You should see him.
- No, he's good.

02:02:43.773 --> 02:02:44.983
I can thump.

02:02:45.399 --> 02:02:47.529
Mr. Thorpe up there, a typical case.

02:02:47.818 --> 02:02:50.738
I told him the story
of the Midnight Caller.

02:02:59.705 --> 02:03:02.115
"Someone is outside, knocking."

02:03:02.208 --> 02:03:04.958
"No, don't open it, mother.

02:03:05.503 --> 02:03:07.923
What living thing
could be out in such a storm?"

02:03:10.216 --> 02:03:11.506
You know the story,

02:03:11.634 --> 02:03:15.434
but people can't get enough of them,
like little children.

02:03:16.472 --> 02:03:19.772
Because, well, they connect the stories
to themselves, I suppose,

02:03:19.850 --> 02:03:21.640
and we all love hearing about ourselves,

02:03:21.727 --> 02:03:26.517
so long as the people in the stories
are us, but not us.

02:03:26.607 --> 02:03:28.357
Not us in the end, especially.

02:03:29.193 --> 02:03:31.243
The Midnight Caller gets him...

02:03:31.987 --> 02:03:32.987
never me.

02:03:33.781 --> 02:03:35.071
I'll live forever.

02:03:38.869 --> 02:03:39.949
I must say...

02:03:41.163 --> 02:03:45.383
it's always interesting watching them
after Clarence has worked his art,

02:03:45.459 --> 02:03:46.919
watching them negotiate...

02:03:48.045 --> 02:03:49.085
the passage.

02:03:51.006 --> 02:03:52.006
Passage?

02:03:53.717 --> 02:03:54.757
From here to there.

02:03:55.511 --> 02:03:57.471
To the other side. Watching them...

02:03:58.389 --> 02:04:01.349
try to make sense of it
as they pass to that other place...

02:04:03.519 --> 02:04:06.809
I do like looking into their eyes
as they try to make sense of it.

02:04:09.525 --> 02:04:10.525
I do.

02:04:11.986 --> 02:04:12.986
I do.

02:04:15.030 --> 02:04:17.370
Try to make sense of what?

02:04:18.159 --> 02:04:19.159
All of it.

02:04:20.786 --> 02:04:23.996
And do they ever...

02:04:26.167 --> 02:04:27.167
succeed?

02:04:32.006 --> 02:04:33.046
How would I know?

02:04:33.507 --> 02:04:34.587
I'm only watching.

02:04:34.675 --> 02:04:38.255
Whoa!

02:04:38.345 --> 02:04:40.845
Well, Fort Morgan.

02:04:40.931 --> 02:04:43.851
I presume we're all staying at the hotel?

02:04:43.934 --> 02:04:47.444
Including Mr. Thorpe.
Too late to drop him with the sheriff.

02:04:52.902 --> 02:04:55.912
I suppose Mr. Thorpe will stay
in your room, Clarence.

02:04:56.280 --> 02:04:59.280
- Don't fancy much having him in mine.
- Whatever you say, boss.

02:04:59.825 --> 02:05:01.485
Or we could sit him up in the parlor.

02:05:01.911 --> 02:05:03.791
Little surprise for the guests
in the morning.

02:05:03.871 --> 02:05:06.251
Give him a newspaper, sir,
and a glass of port.

02:05:08.167 --> 02:05:10.747
Oof!

02:05:11.587 --> 02:05:14.297
- You clumsy fool!
- Sorry, sir.

02:05:14.381 --> 02:05:16.631
Don't apologize to me.
It's Mr. Thorpe, isn't it?

02:05:17.259 --> 02:05:18.719
Sorry, Mr. Thorpe.

02:05:22.181 --> 02:05:23.221
Joking aside...

02:05:23.682 --> 02:05:25.022
your room, I think, Clarence.

02:05:25.100 --> 02:05:27.350
Whatever you say, sir. If you say so.

02:05:27.436 --> 02:05:28.896
No worries about him snoring.

02:05:28.979 --> 02:05:31.269
- I'm not worried, boss.
- You never worry.

02:05:31.357 --> 02:05:33.607
- One of your virtues.
- Thanks very much.

02:05:35.361 --> 02:05:36.651
There we go.

02:05:49.416 --> 02:05:51.456
- Go ahead on.
- Oh, après vous.

02:05:59.343 --> 02:06:00.553
Ladies first.

02:06:03.013 --> 02:06:04.563
I must be helped down.

02:07:00.613 --> 02:07:03.373
Will someone open the door for a lady?

02:07:10.080 --> 02:07:12.040
Dr. Betjeman is waiting.

02:07:24.261 --> 02:07:25.261
Step.

02:07:26.180 --> 02:07:27.180
Step.

02:07:27.890 --> 02:07:28.890
Step.

02:07:29.767 --> 02:07:30.767
Step.

02:07:31.602 --> 02:07:32.602
Step.

02:07:33.145 --> 02:07:34.145
Step.

02:07:34.730 --> 02:07:35.730
Step.

02:07:36.440 --> 02:07:37.360
Step.

02:07:37.441 --> 02:07:38.441
Yah!

02:07:38.817 --> 02:07:39.817
Step.

02:07:40.778 --> 02:07:41.778
Yah! Yah!

02:07:49.328 --> 02:07:50.408
Yah! Yah!

02:07:53.582 --> 02:07:55.252
Yah! Hiyah!
