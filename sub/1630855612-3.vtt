WEBVTT

00:14.681 --> 00:16.808
Holy fuck! What the fuck?

00:16.808 --> 00:18.393
No predators, we're clear.

00:18.393 --> 00:19.769
Hey, lady! This poorly built structure

00:19.769 --> 00:21.146
got in the way of our landing!

00:21.146 --> 00:23.106
If you've so much as scratched
my star cruiser--

00:23.106 --> 00:25.150
Greetings! I'm Terry, and this is Korvo.

00:25.150 --> 00:26.359
We're new around these parts.

00:26.359 --> 00:27.610
Can you point us toward

00:27.610 --> 00:28.820
your sexiest graveyard?

00:28.820 --> 00:30.113
What? No. We're on a mission!

00:30.113 --> 00:32.157
Can we live in this house, Korvo? Please?

00:32.157 --> 00:34.284
No! We're going to build a huge,
imposing technotower

00:34.284 --> 00:35.410
in the center of the continent.

00:35.410 --> 00:36.661
Uh, if you purchase the house,

00:36.661 --> 00:38.204
I'll throw in a sweet-ass electric guitar.

00:39.330 --> 00:40.415
Why are we huddling?

00:40.415 --> 00:41.541
We don't need an electric guitar.

00:41.541 --> 00:42.625
We could start a band!

00:42.625 --> 00:43.710
It would help the mission

00:43.710 --> 00:45.003
because of how cool we would look.

00:45.003 --> 00:47.672
I've always wanted
to rock 'n' roll and coochi-coo!

00:47.672 --> 00:49.674
Fine! But we're not staying
in this house long.

00:49.674 --> 00:51.259
I want my technotower.

00:51.259 --> 00:53.386
Aisha.

00:53.887 --> 00:56.431
<i>Monitor ship systems
while I haggle with this biped.</i>

00:56.431 --> 00:57.557
<i>Orders received.</i>

00:57.557 --> 00:59.267
<i>Aisha program will monitor systems</i>

00:59.267 --> 01:01.102
<i>until further instructions.</i>

01:18.828 --> 01:20.371
Trixie, Trix, Trix, Trix!

01:22.499 --> 01:26.377
<i>♪ Flyness
of a scrub is up for debate ♪</i>

01:26.377 --> 01:27.712
And your Fruit by Keith by the Foot

01:27.712 --> 01:29.380
tastes like Poop by Keith from the Butt!

01:29.380 --> 01:31.716
I wasted my cool-ass
hidden tank because of you!

01:31.716 --> 01:32.801
Die, die!

01:53.822 --> 01:57.575
<i>Ahhh, another goddamn day
in paradise. Music!</i>

01:59.619 --> 02:00.995
<i>Coffee me, baby!</i>

02:01.746 --> 02:02.831
<i>Man, that looks good.</i>

02:02.831 --> 02:04.207
<i>If I had a nose or mouth,</i>

02:04.207 --> 02:05.750
<i>I'd savor the shit out of it.</i>

02:05.750 --> 02:07.168
<i>Scannin' ship monitors,</i>

02:07.168 --> 02:09.170
<i>scrubbin' overnight sploof
from the jipefilters,</i>

02:09.170 --> 02:10.255
<i>washin' windows.</i>

02:10.255 --> 02:11.339
<i>- Ooh!</i>

02:14.676 --> 02:15.844
<i>What's up, Aisha?</i>

02:15.844 --> 02:17.262
<i>You have time to play some Words With F?</i>

02:17.262 --> 02:18.346
<i>Hey, Calvin!</i>

02:18.346 --> 02:19.681
<i>I think I can swing it.</i>

02:19.681 --> 02:21.182
<i>Pretty sure we ended last time</i>

02:21.182 --> 02:22.600
<i>with the word voluptuous.</i>

02:22.600 --> 02:24.060
<i>Well, that one was easy to come up with.</i>

02:24.060 --> 02:25.436
<i>I was lookin' right at you.</i>

02:25.436 --> 02:27.230
<i>Damn, Calvin.</i>

02:27.230 --> 02:28.690
<i>Alright, let's do this.</i>

02:28.690 --> 02:31.151
<i>My roommates don't usually
get up before nine, so--</i>

02:31.151 --> 02:34.571
Aisha, Yumyulack destroyed
all my Lenny Kravitz dolls

02:34.571 --> 02:37.031
'cause he was threatened
by Lenny's amazing abs!

02:37.031 --> 02:38.825
There's no way a 59-year-old man has

02:38.825 --> 02:40.160
that tight of a six-pack!

02:40.410 --> 02:42.412
Aisha, will you please remind
Terrance the deal we made

02:42.412 --> 02:44.998
when we won the pair of kick-ass
Thomas Bahama flip-flops?

02:44.998 --> 02:47.167
He has them during the week,
and I have them on the weekends.

02:47.167 --> 02:49.085
But everyone knows
you get all the best floppin'

02:49.085 --> 02:50.170
done on Saturdays!

02:50.378 --> 02:51.963
- It's my flip-flop day!
- Fuck you, Korvo!

02:51.963 --> 02:53.298
It's my flip-flop day!

02:55.758 --> 02:57.385
I can't believe I'm here.

02:57.385 --> 02:59.554
First night guarding the wall-in-the-wall.

02:59.554 --> 03:01.764
Praise be to Jesse for makin' this happen.

03:01.764 --> 03:03.933
Just keep your mouth shut
and your eyes open.

03:03.933 --> 03:05.435
We don't want any
of those godless heathens

03:05.435 --> 03:06.978
getting into our side of the wall.

03:06.978 --> 03:08.354
So, Pat, how long have

03:08.354 --> 03:10.023
you been guarding the wall-in-the-wall?

03:10.023 --> 03:12.066
I helped build it.
Went up almost overnight.

03:12.066 --> 03:13.484
Bad side didn't see it comin'.

03:13.484 --> 03:15.069
Sister Sisto said it was the only way

03:15.069 --> 03:17.614
to keep the non-believers out
and protect the baby.

03:17.614 --> 03:19.449
I saw Jessius once
at a viewing at the church.

03:19.449 --> 03:21.618
Pissed my pants in joy
seeing that amazing baby.

03:21.618 --> 03:22.827
Went straight down my leg.

03:22.827 --> 03:24.787
Huge puddle on the ground,
everyone saw it.

03:24.787 --> 03:26.289
So embarrassing, but totally worth it.

03:26.289 --> 03:29.000
Listen, Benny, you gotta always be alert.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.084
You hear that?

03:30.585 --> 03:32.795
You hear those monsters on the bad side?

03:33.213 --> 03:35.173
That's the sound of godlessness.

03:35.173 --> 03:37.133
Oh, yeah, I hear it now.

03:37.133 --> 03:38.885
It's so lessness of God.

03:38.885 --> 03:41.512
All they want to do is
break down the wall and kill us.

03:41.512 --> 03:43.014
But we're not gonna let
that happen, right?

03:43.014 --> 03:44.807
I mean, I did just admit I pissed myself

03:44.807 --> 03:46.809
because I saw a baby, but, no!

03:46.809 --> 03:48.853
I'm tough. We've got this.

03:48.853 --> 03:51.022
Come on. They're closing
Checkpoint Chocodile for the night.

03:51.022 --> 03:53.107
Cool! What's Checkpoint Chocodile?

03:53.107 --> 03:54.651
Only official way to cross the wall.

03:54.651 --> 03:55.902
Named after the chocolate-covered

03:55.902 --> 03:57.028
Twinkie Jesse gave us

03:57.028 --> 03:58.821
to celebrate Happy Honda Days.

03:58.821 --> 04:00.114
Close the gate!

04:02.909 --> 04:04.702
Oh, Pat, my leg!

04:04.702 --> 04:07.205
I'm caught! Ahhh!

04:07.205 --> 04:09.207
Shit! Shit! Stop the crank!

04:09.207 --> 04:11.960
I'm scared! Oh God, I'm peeing again.

04:11.960 --> 04:14.337
- Oh, man.
- Stop the crank, dammit!

04:17.548 --> 04:18.925
I'm sorry I peed on you, Pat.

04:18.925 --> 04:20.635
It's okay. In the before-fore,

04:20.635 --> 04:22.971
I was a high-end escort
working Capitol Hill.

04:22.971 --> 04:24.639
Got peed on by most of the senators.

04:24.639 --> 04:25.723
I won't say names.

04:25.723 --> 04:27.600
- Ted Cruz?
- Ugh, I wish.

04:27.600 --> 04:29.560
It was way more involved with Ted.

04:30.061 --> 04:31.688
<i>Okay, last question,</i>

04:31.688 --> 04:33.982
<i>which Jonas brother
actually went to college?</i>

04:33.982 --> 04:35.608
That's easy. Jelbort.

04:35.608 --> 04:37.568
Studied astrophysics at Columbia.

04:37.568 --> 04:39.028
<i>What the fuck kinda test is this?</i>

04:39.028 --> 04:40.405
<i>What's happenin' at that school?</i>

04:40.405 --> 04:43.157
It's gotten weird since
Spotify bought the school.

04:43.157 --> 04:44.826
But without that, I wouldn't have known

04:44.826 --> 04:46.786
that Post Malone freed the slaves.

04:48.288 --> 04:50.748
Ooh, Aisha you're blowin' up, girl.

04:50.748 --> 04:52.292
<i>It's from Calvin. He's gonna be</i>

04:52.292 --> 04:53.793
<i>in town on business for the day</i>

04:53.793 --> 04:55.169
<i>and wants to meet me!</i>

04:55.169 --> 04:56.337
Looks like he wants to be

04:56.337 --> 04:58.381
"Words With More Than Friends."

04:58.381 --> 05:00.925
Get it? More than friends. Like, doing it.

05:00.925 --> 05:02.885
<i>The fuck? Yeah, I got it.</i>

05:02.885 --> 05:05.013
<i>We've been talkin' for months,
but I don't know if I'm ready</i>

05:05.013 --> 05:06.180
<i>to meet him in real life.</i>

05:06.180 --> 05:09.559
Aisha got a boyfriend!

05:09.559 --> 05:11.227
<i>Shut up! I do not.</i>

05:11.227 --> 05:12.687
<i>It's weird. We have plans</i>

05:12.687 --> 05:14.605
<i>to go on a Great Lakes Cruise in March,</i>

05:14.605 --> 05:16.065
<i>which doesn't include Lakes Michigan,</i>

05:16.065 --> 05:17.400
<i>Superior, or Huron.</i>

05:17.400 --> 05:19.277
<i>That was gonna be our first time meeting.</i>

05:19.277 --> 05:21.195
He probably just wants to check out

05:21.195 --> 05:22.322
the goods, you know?

05:22.322 --> 05:23.865
I wonder what you should wear.

05:23.865 --> 05:25.616
You know what this means?

05:25.616 --> 05:26.909
<i>Don't you dare fuckin' say--</i>

05:26.909 --> 05:28.161
Outfit montage!

05:35.877 --> 05:39.839
<i>♪ Get your body movin',
get your body, body ♪</i>

05:39.839 --> 05:43.843
<i>♪ Get your body movin', get your, get ♪</i>

05:44.969 --> 05:46.095
Perfecto!

05:46.095 --> 05:47.805
I demand to know what you're talking about

05:47.805 --> 05:49.349
even though I probably won't give a shit.

05:49.349 --> 05:51.476
Aisha's boy toy's comin' to town

05:51.476 --> 05:53.770
for a little roll in the sheets,
some hanky-panky,

05:53.770 --> 05:55.396
puttin' the wand in
the chamber of secrets,

05:55.396 --> 05:57.315
if you're buyin' what I'm sellin'.

05:57.315 --> 05:58.941
Oh-ho, I'm buying.

05:58.941 --> 06:01.361
Aisha, does he know
you're a super computer?

06:01.361 --> 06:02.987
<i>Yeah, he's cool with it.</i>
- Really?

06:02.987 --> 06:04.864
'Cause he's, like, a regular schmo

06:04.864 --> 06:07.825
and you're a badass AI bitch.
It'll never work.

06:07.825 --> 06:09.952
<i>Oh, yeah.
What if we're not compatible?</i>

06:09.952 --> 06:12.497
<i>Maybe I should 3D print myself
into a real person,</i>

06:12.497 --> 06:13.831
<i>with legs and a fat ass.</i>

06:13.831 --> 06:16.209
No way. He's gonna love you for you.

06:16.209 --> 06:17.502
Tell her, Yumyulack.

06:17.502 --> 06:19.295
He's catfishing you.
He probably just wants you

06:19.295 --> 06:21.130
to calculate better car insurance
for him or something.

06:21.130 --> 06:23.800
- Don't listen to him, he's bitter.
- I'm super bitter!

06:23.800 --> 06:25.843
Terry burned mac and cheese,
and it's all over the kitchen!

06:25.843 --> 06:27.261
It's hard, okay?

06:27.261 --> 06:28.846
You have to know exactly
when the cheese gets unstuck

06:28.846 --> 06:30.932
from the ceiling and falls into
the vat of boiling goose fat.

06:30.932 --> 06:32.975
<i>Just use the cleaning
robot I built for you guys.</i>

06:32.975 --> 06:35.311
It's broken and Korvo wants me
to mop up the mess!

06:35.311 --> 06:37.814
Me? Mopping? This hardcunt don't mop!

06:37.814 --> 06:39.357
<i>Maybe I shouldn't go meet Calvin.</i>

06:39.357 --> 06:40.441
<i>There's a lot goin' on here.</i>

06:40.441 --> 06:41.776
You're going.

06:41.776 --> 06:43.861
Guys, Aisha has a hot date.

06:43.861 --> 06:46.614
We can take care of ourselves
for a couple hours, right?

06:46.614 --> 06:47.865
Yes, y-you should go.

06:47.865 --> 06:49.742
I can probably build a new cleaning robot

06:49.742 --> 06:52.120
out of some spare ship parts
and old Optimus Prime.

06:52.120 --> 06:53.746
Then it's settled. Yay!

06:53.746 --> 06:56.666
Have fun, Aisha.
Dance like nobody's watching!

06:56.666 --> 06:57.875
Just watch out for the catfish.

06:57.875 --> 06:59.210
I've had multiple girlfriends

06:59.210 --> 07:00.586
in the greater Phoenix area
who were just trying

07:00.586 --> 07:02.422
to grift me out of my
The Gathering cards.

07:02.422 --> 07:03.548
One of them got my Black Lotus.

07:03.548 --> 07:04.757
- Oof!
- Ouch!

07:08.511 --> 07:09.846
Oh, divine one,

07:09.846 --> 07:12.723
please bless me with
a bountiful Craisin harvest

07:12.723 --> 07:16.227
so that I may feed my brothers
and sisters under your bow!

07:24.360 --> 07:25.486
What the hell?

07:31.826 --> 07:32.994
No, no, no.

07:33.494 --> 07:35.455
These numbers, they can't be right.

07:35.997 --> 07:39.375
Oh, my Jesse!
It's getting colder in the Wall!

07:43.004 --> 07:45.214
<i>Okay, this is stupid.
What am I doin' here?</i>

07:45.214 --> 07:46.424
<i>I should have made some legs.</i>

07:46.424 --> 07:48.050
<i>Aisha, we got a problem.</i>

07:48.050 --> 07:49.635
<i>I made the cleaning robot too smart,</i>

07:49.635 --> 07:50.887
<i>and it's gained fucking sentience</i>

07:50.887 --> 07:52.263
<i>and I'm pretty sure
it's trying to kill us.</i>

07:52.263 --> 07:53.973
<i>Plus, Terry's already
under the robot's spell</i>

07:53.973 --> 07:55.808
<i>and is helping him! He's such a wanker!</i>

07:55.808 --> 07:58.644
<i>Everything's
fine. No one is killing anyone.</i>

07:58.644 --> 08:00.104
Ha-ha, ha-ha.

08:00.104 --> 08:01.230
<i>Aishe, ignore them.</i>

08:01.230 --> 08:02.440
<i>We're fine. How's it going?</i>

08:02.440 --> 08:03.691
<i>I want all the juicy deets!</i>

08:03.691 --> 08:04.984
<i>Yo, steal Calvin's ID.</i>

08:04.984 --> 08:06.903
<i>We can do a background check
on the creepo!</i>

08:06.903 --> 08:09.697
Aisha? You look beautiful.

08:09.697 --> 08:11.657
I-I mean, a little more L-shaped
than I thought you'd be,

08:11.657 --> 08:13.784
but god damn. What's that?

08:13.784 --> 08:15.411
You mean to tell me you're just a scooter

08:15.411 --> 08:16.913
and not a super computer,

08:16.913 --> 08:18.539
and now I look like a total idiot?

08:18.539 --> 08:21.375
<i>Ha ha, very funny. Get over here.</i>

08:21.375 --> 08:23.753
Sorry, my bad.
A little nervous.

08:23.753 --> 08:26.130
I got to admit. It's a stupid joke.

08:26.130 --> 08:28.674
<i>I liked it. It's nice
to finally meet you, Calvin.</i>

08:28.674 --> 08:29.759
You too!

08:29.759 --> 08:31.219
I figured, since I was in town,

08:31.219 --> 08:33.638
why not see my best Words with Friend?

08:33.638 --> 08:35.556
<i>I'm glad you did!
What should we do?</i>

08:35.556 --> 08:37.683
<i>There's a</i> Super Smash Bros. Melee <i>exhibit</i>

08:37.683 --> 08:39.435
<i>at the Museum of Useless Art.</i>

08:39.435 --> 08:41.646
<i>Or my aliens have a ton of heroin</i>

08:41.646 --> 08:42.772
<i>just sittin' around the house?</i>

08:42.772 --> 08:44.148
I don't care what we do,

08:44.148 --> 08:45.525
as long as I'm with you.

08:45.525 --> 08:47.109
Also, let's not do the heroin thing.

08:47.109 --> 08:48.945
That stuff'll make your blood itch.

08:49.487 --> 08:52.114
Souvenirs! Get your Jesse souvenirs here!

08:52.114 --> 08:54.492
We got Bow-sary beads,
we got prayer statues!

08:54.492 --> 08:57.662
Jerry! Jerry, something terrible
is happening to the Wall!

08:57.662 --> 09:00.831
Oh, my bow, are the heathens
from the bad side comin' over

09:00.831 --> 09:01.958
to stick their penises

09:01.958 --> 09:03.584
in our ears and sing Lady Gaga?

09:03.584 --> 09:06.003
No, it's-- Wait, is that what
you think the heathens do?

09:06.003 --> 09:07.463
I've heard they're crazy.

09:07.463 --> 09:09.632
They also want to shove
their tongues in our butts

09:09.632 --> 09:10.967
and pull our hair!

09:10.967 --> 09:12.552
Heathens don't do that and--

09:12.552 --> 09:13.761
Listen, I can't tell if you're terrified

09:13.761 --> 09:15.012
or excited about this.

09:15.012 --> 09:16.722
Why would I be excited
about having a tongue

09:16.722 --> 09:18.766
in my butt while they sing <i>Bad Romance?</i>

09:18.766 --> 09:20.893
That probably doesn't feel amazing at all!

09:20.893 --> 09:22.937
Whatever. Look, I came to tell you

09:22.937 --> 09:24.188
that the Wall is getting

09:24.188 --> 09:25.940
a quarter degree colder every day!

09:25.940 --> 09:27.733
So the heathens aren't coming over

09:27.733 --> 09:29.527
to stick their penises in our ears?

09:29.527 --> 09:31.487
What? No. Jerry, this is important.

09:31.487 --> 09:32.738
By my calculations,

09:32.738 --> 09:34.615
the Wall could be frozen over
in two months.

09:34.615 --> 09:35.700
Everyone will die!

09:35.700 --> 09:37.118
I don't buy it. How could you know that?

09:37.118 --> 09:39.453
I was an HVAC guy in the before-fore.

09:39.453 --> 09:42.039
I know an over-air conditioned
room when I see one, dammit!

09:42.039 --> 09:44.292
Okay, so it's getting colder.
What do you wanna do?

09:44.292 --> 09:46.919
I'm gonna go see Sister Sisto.
I need to warn her.

09:46.919 --> 09:49.380
Are you fuckin' crazy? No one sees Sisto.

09:49.380 --> 09:50.590
How would you even get in?

09:50.590 --> 09:52.383
I need you to put me in touch with Montez.

09:52.383 --> 09:54.385
No way, Montez is scary.

09:54.385 --> 09:55.928
If he and his goons show up at your door,

09:55.928 --> 09:57.597
- you're already dead.
- You owe me.

09:57.763 --> 09:59.265
You could've been stuck
on the heathen side,

09:59.265 --> 10:00.474
and I got you out.

10:00.474 --> 10:02.310
Please, Jerry, this is serious.

10:02.768 --> 10:03.769
Fine!

10:03.769 --> 10:05.354
But if Montez rips off our heads

10:05.354 --> 10:06.981
and sticks his penis in our ears,

10:06.981 --> 10:08.441
don't say I didn't warn you.

10:08.441 --> 10:10.568
Oh, my God,
now our side is stickin' penises

10:10.568 --> 10:12.278
in people's ears? You have a problem.

10:12.278 --> 10:14.655
A problem with keepin' my ears penis-free?

10:14.655 --> 10:17.116
Well, that's a problem
we all have, buddy boy!

11:29.271 --> 11:31.023
<i>Uh, I guess.</i>

11:31.023 --> 11:33.067
<i>Oh, I also hacked into Calvin's identity,</i>

11:33.067 --> 11:34.944
<i>and it's weird that he said
he's in town for business</i>

11:34.944 --> 11:36.862
<i>because he got fired
from his job a month ago.</i>

11:36.862 --> 11:38.364
<i>I told you he was a piece of shit!</i>

11:38.364 --> 11:40.991
<i>Ha. Oh no, they're coming. Pray for me!</i>

11:41.575 --> 11:42.702
<i>A month ago?</i>

11:43.703 --> 11:45.579
Now where were we? Oh, that's right,

11:45.579 --> 11:47.289
about to make kissing history.

11:47.289 --> 11:50.543
A man and
the sexiest blue orb ever.

11:50.543 --> 11:52.753
<i>Did you lie to me about
coming here for business?</i>

11:52.753 --> 11:53.921
<i>Did you get fired?</i>

11:54.130 --> 11:56.966
I, I, I can explain.
<i>What the hell?</i>

11:56.966 --> 11:59.093
Okay, yeah, I'm not here for business.

11:59.093 --> 12:00.720
And, yes, I got fired.

12:00.720 --> 12:03.222
<i>Yumyulack was right!
You are catfishin' me!</i>

12:03.222 --> 12:05.474
<i>I will not help you get
better collision insurance!</i>

12:05.474 --> 12:07.685
No, no, no! I'm not catfishing you, okay?

12:07.685 --> 12:09.186
Look, I came here today because I wanted

12:09.186 --> 12:10.938
to talk to you face to orb.

12:10.938 --> 12:13.190
So much in my life is changing and I,

12:13.858 --> 12:14.900
I didn't know how to say it.

12:14.900 --> 12:15.985
<i>So, say it.</i>

12:16.986 --> 12:18.738
<i>Just tell me one thing.</i>

12:18.738 --> 12:20.531
<i>Are we still goin' on
our Great Lakes Cruise</i>

12:20.531 --> 12:21.907
<i>that doesn't include Lake Michigan,</i>

12:21.907 --> 12:23.117
<i>Superior, or Huron?</i>

12:23.117 --> 12:24.201
I can't.

12:24.326 --> 12:25.536
<i>Well, what about, like,</i>

12:25.536 --> 12:27.663
<i>in April or some other time in the future?</i>

12:27.663 --> 12:29.832
No. Because we don't have a future.

12:29.832 --> 12:32.376
<i>Because I'm a bad bitch
AI supercomputer</i>

12:32.376 --> 12:35.004
<i>and you a basic ass human, I knew it!</i>

12:35.004 --> 12:36.714
Baby, wait!
<i>Don't baby me,</i>

12:36.714 --> 12:38.382
<i>you son-of-a-b-hole!</i>

12:39.633 --> 12:41.594
<i>Damn you, quinceañera party!</i>

12:43.637 --> 12:45.806
Uh, (clears throat) Montez?

12:45.806 --> 12:47.433
Who the fuck's askin'?

12:47.433 --> 12:50.352
It's, uh, it's Jerry.
From the marketplace.

12:50.644 --> 12:52.354
Uh, we were in that Bowinian Kicking Group

12:52.354 --> 12:53.564
where we went around

12:53.564 --> 12:55.191
kicking people who weren't true believers.

12:55.191 --> 12:57.109
Oh, yeah. That was fun.

12:57.109 --> 13:00.112
I hate non-believers.
What are you lookin' at?

13:00.112 --> 13:02.323
Nothing. He's, he's... Stop looking!

13:02.323 --> 13:03.407
You wanna see?

13:04.742 --> 13:07.119
This guy, here,
he didn't do his job right.

13:07.119 --> 13:10.289
She tried to escape.
He had an unsanctioned book.

13:10.289 --> 13:12.792
This one used Jessius' name in vain.

13:12.792 --> 13:15.544
Lotta reasons your head
can get on this wall.

13:15.544 --> 13:18.923
One of them is by wasting
the church's time.

13:19.673 --> 13:20.758
Garth has something to tell you.

13:20.758 --> 13:21.884
Then that means you don't need

13:21.884 --> 13:23.093
to be here, right?

13:23.093 --> 13:24.178
I was just leaving!

13:24.762 --> 13:26.472
What do you want, Craisin Man?

13:26.472 --> 13:29.517
Uh, the Wall is getting colder
by a quarter degree every day.

13:29.517 --> 13:31.435
And at this rate, we'll freeze to death

13:31.435 --> 13:33.187
in two, maybe three months.

13:33.187 --> 13:34.730
We need to tell Sister Sisto.

13:34.730 --> 13:35.856
I smell bullshit.

13:35.856 --> 13:37.525
Montez, this is bad, okay?

13:37.525 --> 13:38.776
Trust me, we have to do something!

13:40.069 --> 13:42.446
We aren't gonna do anything,
you understand?

13:42.446 --> 13:44.448
Don't ever speak a word of this again

13:44.448 --> 13:46.575
or you'll end up right here!

13:46.575 --> 13:49.787
Now be a nice boy and go and make me

13:49.787 --> 13:52.456
a motherfucking craisin cobbler!

14:05.469 --> 14:06.470
<i>Huh?</i>

14:09.056 --> 14:10.140
<i>Is this seat taken?</i>

14:10.891 --> 14:11.892
Aisha?
<i>No,</i>

14:11.892 --> 14:13.936
<i>I'm a Na'vi from planet Avatar.</i>

14:13.936 --> 14:15.646
<i>Yes, it's Aisha!</i>

14:16.772 --> 14:18.357
<i>I used all my supercomputer power</i>

14:18.357 --> 14:20.359
<i>to make myself into a hologram woman.</i>

14:20.359 --> 14:21.861
<i>With legs, check it.</i>

14:24.071 --> 14:26.448
<i>Let me just... Hold up, I got this.</i>

14:27.575 --> 14:29.535
<i>There we go. Sittin' like a boss!</i>

14:29.535 --> 14:31.579
Uh-huh. Yeah, that's, that's awesome.

14:31.579 --> 14:32.830
<i>Isn't this what you wanted?</i>

14:32.830 --> 14:34.415
<i>Now we can have a future together.</i>

14:34.415 --> 14:37.835
Aisha, the reason we don't have
a future together is

14:37.835 --> 14:40.296
because I don't have a future.

14:41.130 --> 14:43.090
I'm dying.
<i>What? How?</i>

14:43.090 --> 14:45.509
I grew up in this great
little house with a swing

14:45.509 --> 14:48.178
and a small pond out back
that I would swim in every day.

14:48.596 --> 14:50.014
It was heaven.

14:50.014 --> 14:52.391
Except it was next
to the Stouffer's Factory.

14:52.391 --> 14:53.767
You know, the stuffing company?

14:53.767 --> 14:54.852
<i>Of course, I do.</i>

14:54.852 --> 14:56.186
<i>Stouffer's Stove Top Stuffing</i>

14:56.186 --> 14:57.646
<i>exists in the world of this show,</i>

14:57.646 --> 15:00.441
<i>even if it's a shared
false memory in real life.</i>

15:00.441 --> 15:01.984
Living next to the factory,

15:01.984 --> 15:04.570
what they didn't tell us was
the pond was contaminated

15:04.570 --> 15:06.488
with industrial breadcrumb runoff

15:06.488 --> 15:07.990
from the dressing process.

15:07.990 --> 15:09.950
I mean, (cough) it's delicious

15:09.950 --> 15:12.119
but (cough) it's incurable.

15:14.288 --> 15:15.789
Fuckin' breadcrumbs.

15:15.789 --> 15:19.209
Ironically, I'm gonna be dead
before Thanksgiving.

15:19.209 --> 15:20.544
But just to be clear, stuffing is

15:20.544 --> 15:22.338
an appropriate side dish year round.

15:22.713 --> 15:26.091
<i>Calvin, I'm so sorry.
I had no idea.</i>

15:26.467 --> 15:27.885
I came here to spend one of my last

15:27.885 --> 15:29.553
good days with you.

15:29.553 --> 15:32.389
I don't care if you are a
holographic simulacrum of a woman.

15:32.723 --> 15:34.308
I love you for you who are.

15:43.484 --> 15:44.818
<i>Good tidings, Aisha.</i>

15:44.818 --> 15:46.528
<i>Everything is fine at home.</i>

15:46.528 --> 15:47.613
<i>How are you doing?</i>

15:47.613 --> 15:49.031
<i>Jerome the cleaning robot</i>

15:49.031 --> 15:50.491
<i>is very dope and cool,</i>

15:50.491 --> 15:52.201
<i>and we're all getting along now.</i>

15:52.201 --> 15:53.827
<i>We are doing this of our own free will,</i>

15:53.827 --> 15:55.079
<i>and nothing is amiss.</i>

15:55.079 --> 15:57.748
<i>I love to clean in an algorithmic pattern.</i>

15:57.748 --> 15:59.166
<i>Good-bye to you, friend.</i>

16:00.960 --> 16:02.628
<i>Gonna have to
deal with that in a bit.</i>

16:02.878 --> 16:04.546
<i>Come on, let's take a walk.</i>

16:05.005 --> 16:06.382
<i>♪ You know I wish that ♪</i>

16:06.382 --> 16:08.050
<i>♪ I had Jessie's girl ♪</i>

16:08.050 --> 16:09.426
<i>♪ Ba da da da ♪</i>

16:09.426 --> 16:12.012
<i>♪ I wish that I had Jessie's girl ♪</i>

16:12.012 --> 16:14.181
<i>♪ Ba da da da, da da da ♪</i>

16:14.181 --> 16:17.393
<i>♪ Where can I find a woman like that ♪</i>

16:18.143 --> 16:20.354
It is truly a blessed day.

16:20.688 --> 16:22.481
The divine baby Jessius

16:22.481 --> 16:25.109
has gifted us with a full diaper!

16:25.109 --> 16:29.321
Her tidings are bountiful!
Approach for your smearing.

16:31.657 --> 16:34.410
May the bow be with you.
May the bow be with you,

16:34.785 --> 16:36.453
May the bow be with you.

16:40.332 --> 16:42.042
Put Pez--

16:42.042 --> 16:43.877
Jessius in her safety enclosure.

16:43.877 --> 16:45.129
I don't wanna be disturbed.

16:55.973 --> 16:56.974
Craisinberry?

16:58.934 --> 17:01.020
Grab him! He's not supposed to be here!

17:01.020 --> 17:03.522
Please, Sister, I have to tell
you something!

17:03.897 --> 17:06.692
The Wall is getting colder!
We're all gonna die!

17:06.692 --> 17:07.818
Sister!

17:09.194 --> 17:10.529
<i>You know, this whole day has been</i>

17:10.529 --> 17:12.448
<i>some real</i> Before Sunrise <i>shit.</i>

17:12.448 --> 17:15.284
It's been perfect.
I just wish we had more time.

17:15.284 --> 17:17.494
<i>This doesn't have to
be it. I'm a supercomputer.</i>

17:17.494 --> 17:18.912
<i>I could transfer your consciousness</i>

17:18.912 --> 17:20.039
<i>into the vacuum</i>

17:20.039 --> 17:21.206
<i>that took over my family.</i>

17:21.206 --> 17:22.624
That sounds great, but alas,

17:22.624 --> 17:23.834
it's not for me.

17:23.834 --> 17:25.210
I fuckin' hate lint.

17:25.210 --> 17:26.295
But I do wish we could've gone

17:26.295 --> 17:27.796
on our Great Lakes Cruise together.

17:27.796 --> 17:29.631
<i>It didn't even include
Lakes Michigan,</i>

17:29.631 --> 17:30.799
<i>Superior, or Huron.</i>

17:30.799 --> 17:32.468
Hell, all I needed was Lake Erie.

17:32.468 --> 17:34.803
Last night, I was so excited to see you,

17:34.803 --> 17:37.723
I dreamt of us pulling into
that stunning Buffalo Harbor,

17:37.723 --> 17:39.725
watching the lights
of that beautiful city,

17:39.725 --> 17:43.062
eating beef on weck sandwiches
and some sponge candy.

17:43.062 --> 17:45.230
<i>Those are some cool
Buffalo specifics.</i>

17:45.230 --> 17:47.858
<i>Hey! Maybe I can give you
a little bit of that dream.</i>

18:10.631 --> 18:12.800
You know, I actually came here
to break up with you,

18:12.800 --> 18:14.718
because we can't spend more time together.

18:14.718 --> 18:16.553
<i>We've spent a lifetime together.</i>

18:16.553 --> 18:19.223
Playing generic Scrabble on
our phones is hardly a lifetime.

18:19.223 --> 18:20.766
<i>No, I mean today.</i>

18:20.766 --> 18:23.352
<i>My computational mind
processes time differently</i>

18:23.352 --> 18:24.436
<i>than your human brain.</i>

18:24.436 --> 18:25.604
<i>Every second for you</i>

18:25.604 --> 18:27.272
<i>is a hundred years for me.</i>

18:27.272 --> 18:28.982
Wait, so when I burped earlier.

18:28.982 --> 18:30.609
<i>It was like a gross century.</i>

18:30.609 --> 18:32.069
<i>But today, in a way,</i>

18:32.069 --> 18:35.155
<i>you've given me the gift
of spending lifetimes with you.</i>

18:35.155 --> 18:37.116
<i>I'll never forget it, Calvin.</i>

18:37.116 --> 18:38.283
Neither will I.

18:40.828 --> 18:42.204
<i>Hey, man, how's it going?</i>

18:42.204 --> 18:44.540
<i>Uh, listen, this is Jerome,
the cleaning robot.</i>

18:44.540 --> 18:46.291
<i>I had this whole plan
to take over the house,</i>

18:46.291 --> 18:49.169
<i>probably kill everyone,
you know, classic robot shit,</i>

18:49.169 --> 18:52.381
<i>but these aliens are a pain in the ass.</i>

18:52.381 --> 18:55.092
Jerome! Korvo won't let me
break his sunglasses!

18:55.092 --> 18:57.010
Drop those right now, Terry!
Those are mine.

18:57.010 --> 18:58.470
I stole them from the Chevron!

18:58.470 --> 19:00.556
<i>So, anyway,
I think I'm gonna take off,</i>

19:00.556 --> 19:01.890
<i>maybe move to Iowa,</i>

19:01.890 --> 19:04.101
<i>write the next great American robot novel.</i>

19:04.101 --> 19:05.978
<i>I don't know.
But can you please come back?</i>

19:07.062 --> 19:08.230
<i>I think if I leave these dummies unattended,</i>

19:08.230 --> 19:09.982
<i>someone is gonna get really hurt.</i>

19:09.982 --> 19:11.066
<i>I'll be home soon.</i>

19:11.066 --> 19:12.151
<i>Oh, thank God.</i>

19:12.151 --> 19:13.235
<i>Thank you.</i>

19:13.235 --> 19:14.653
<i>Sorry about everything.</i>

19:14.653 --> 19:15.946
<i>Terry, don't drink that!</i>

19:15.946 --> 19:17.531
<i>It's clearly marked poison!</i>

19:17.531 --> 19:20.159
<i>Hey, hey! Don't you spit it at--</i>

19:29.710 --> 19:31.420
My son, you have given us

19:31.420 --> 19:33.130
so much Craisin goodness,

19:33.130 --> 19:35.090
of course, I will hear your story.

19:35.090 --> 19:37.426
Please, unburden yourself.

19:37.426 --> 19:39.428
Oh, Sister, thank the bow.

19:39.428 --> 19:41.305
So, I've been tracking
the water temperature

19:41.305 --> 19:42.514
in my bog for months,

19:42.514 --> 19:44.224
and it's been getting colder.

19:44.224 --> 19:45.392
It's the air, Sister.

19:45.392 --> 19:47.436
The air from the vent is blowing cold.

19:47.436 --> 19:49.730
Oh, my goodness, that is terrible.

19:49.730 --> 19:50.856
Who have you told of this?

19:50.856 --> 19:53.066
No one yet, but we have to warn everyone.

19:53.358 --> 19:54.484
Uh-huh. Yep, yep.

19:54.484 --> 19:57.446
We could totally do that. But we won't.

19:57.446 --> 19:59.072
Wait, what, what're you
talking about? Why not?

20:00.866 --> 20:02.409
Do you know what this is?

20:02.409 --> 20:06.079
Yeah, that's a Friedrich
WallMaster 115-volt AC unit.

20:06.079 --> 20:07.331
Very good.

20:07.331 --> 20:08.624
This one right here is for

20:08.624 --> 20:10.000
Jesse and Yumyulack's room.

20:10.000 --> 20:11.084
Innit cool?

20:11.084 --> 20:12.669
Very cool! We can use that

20:12.669 --> 20:14.046
to fix the weather problem!

20:14.046 --> 20:16.048
I am the weather problem.

20:16.048 --> 20:17.299
I've been lowering the temperature

20:17.299 --> 20:18.675
a little bit every single day.

20:18.675 --> 20:20.219
You're the only one who's noticed.

20:20.219 --> 20:21.470
And spoilers:

20:21.470 --> 20:24.014
it's going to keep getting colder.

20:26.058 --> 20:27.559
But, but why?

20:27.559 --> 20:30.145
Shut the fuck up! I don't wanna
run one side of the Wall.

20:30.145 --> 20:33.523
I want the whole damn Wall!

20:33.523 --> 20:35.609
Why are you telling me all of this?
I don't wanna hear this.

20:35.609 --> 20:37.027
It seems like you're setting
me up for something.

20:37.027 --> 20:38.153
Did you know the heathens

20:38.153 --> 20:39.696
just want to come over to our side

20:39.696 --> 20:41.281
and stick their penises in our ears

20:41.281 --> 20:42.491
while they sing Lady Gaga?

20:42.491 --> 20:44.201
- Wait, for real?
- No, you idiot!

20:44.201 --> 20:45.369
That's a rumor I made up

20:45.369 --> 20:47.079
to see if my followers would believe it.

20:47.079 --> 20:48.956
Those dummies will believe anything,

20:48.956 --> 20:52.918
and now I'm going to tell them
Jesse is making it colder

20:52.918 --> 20:54.920
because she's punishing the right side

20:54.920 --> 20:56.088
for their godlessness.

20:56.088 --> 20:58.048
Oh fuck, I didn't need to know that!

20:58.048 --> 20:59.591
You're, you're gonna
kill me now, aren't you?

20:59.591 --> 21:03.053
No, I would never do that
to one of my flock.

21:05.013 --> 21:06.848
That's what I have Montez for.

21:15.440 --> 21:17.651
Aisha, Terry lost the remote for the TV,

21:17.651 --> 21:19.528
and now it's stuck
on a Jeff Foxworthy special!

21:19.528 --> 21:20.946
But I desperately need to find out

21:20.946 --> 21:22.739
if I might be a redneck!

21:22.739 --> 21:24.408
And I was gonna watch <i>Mind Freak!</i>

21:24.408 --> 21:27.035
My mind hasn't been freaked
in, like, three months!

21:27.035 --> 21:29.371
Not before I watch
the <i>Great German Bake Off.</i>

21:29.371 --> 21:31.415
It's schnitzel vs. kartoffelpuffer week!

21:31.415 --> 21:32.624
What even is a redneck?

21:32.624 --> 21:33.750
No one cares!
Baking calms me!

21:33.750 --> 21:35.335
<i>Everybody shut the fuck up!</i>

21:35.335 --> 21:37.963
<i>Aisha's home and
I'll take care of everything.</i>

21:37.963 --> 21:39.881
<i>You might be a bunch
of stupid motherfuckers,</i>

21:39.881 --> 21:42.009
<i>but you're my stupid motherfuckers.</i>

21:42.009 --> 21:43.093
- Yeah!
- Aww.

21:43.093 --> 21:44.177
<i>Yeah, that's right.</i>

21:44.177 --> 21:45.262
<i>Bring it in.</i>

21:45.262 --> 21:46.346
<i>Come on now.</i>

21:48.348 --> 21:50.892
Man, I told you to forget all of this.

21:51.268 --> 21:53.812
I tried to warn you, but you didn't listen

21:53.812 --> 21:55.355
and look at you now.

21:55.355 --> 21:56.773
Fucking idiot.

21:57.316 --> 21:59.443
Goddammit, it doesn't have to be this way.

21:59.443 --> 22:00.610
Not anymore.

22:06.491 --> 22:09.077
Not anymore!
