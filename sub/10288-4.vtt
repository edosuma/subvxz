WEBVTT

00:03.336 --> 00:05.736
-Hey. guys.
-Hey. judge.

00:05.906 --> 00:07.466
Where's Dan?

00:07.641 --> 00:11.981
Last I saw Dan. he was out in the hall
pitching pennies with that shoeshine kid.

00:12.145 --> 00:14.105
-Pay up.
-Hey. it was a leaner.

00:14.281 --> 00:17.311
Get real. Fielding. You were the one
that said double or nothing.

00:17.483 --> 00:20.113
-If I had a piece of piano wire--
-Hey. How you doing?

00:20.286 --> 00:23.376
Well. we're just fine. Your Honor.
How are you?

00:23.556 --> 00:25.076
Well. run along. little boy.

00:25.256 --> 00:29.886
-You owe me for five shines.
-Go suck a shoetree.

00:30.295 --> 00:31.815
Hi. everybody.

00:31.995 --> 00:36.825
Hey. So how's America's favorite
married couple. huh?

00:36.999 --> 00:40.459
-Oh. poor. Very poor.
-We had a very big day today.

00:40.636 --> 00:41.896
We went returning.

00:42.071 --> 00:44.201
-Returning?
-Yes. returning.

00:44.373 --> 00:46.073
It's much more fun than shopping.

00:46.242 --> 00:51.342
We returned the home fitness center.
the hot tub and the home organ.

00:51.514 --> 00:53.744
It's like having a symphony
in your living room.

00:53.916 --> 00:57.376
-Tomorrow. we return the big stuff.
-The big stuff?

00:57.553 --> 01:00.323
Yeah. it's in a garage
on 33rd and Lexington.

01:00.490 --> 01:01.550
Buick?

01:01.724 --> 01:03.564
-Sailboat.
-Oh.

01:03.726 --> 01:07.916
See. Ouon Le now understands we can't
afford to keep acquiring things on impulse.

01:08.097 --> 01:09.957
-Right. Quon Le?
-Right. Mac.

01:10.132 --> 01:14.232
The deal is that she gets to keep one thing
if she agrees to return everything else.

01:14.403 --> 01:17.933
-Well. that sounds prudent.
-What purchase have you decided to keep?

01:18.107 --> 01:19.667
The restaurant.

01:22.111 --> 01:23.941
It was on sale.

01:25.000 --> 01:31.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:19.735 --> 02:20.755
Yeah.

02:21.771 --> 02:24.241
That's what most people say.

02:24.941 --> 02:27.641
You know. there are so many things
that I wanna show you...

02:27.810 --> 02:29.830
...I barely know where to begin.

02:30.011 --> 02:31.381
Try the fire exits.

02:31.545 --> 02:33.535
[LAUGHS]

02:34.081 --> 02:36.241
"Try the fire exit." I love it.

02:36.416 --> 02:39.546
But seriously. folks. I gotta get up there
and get some contracts...

02:39.719 --> 02:41.649
...so don't anybody get too comfy.

02:41.821 --> 02:44.451
Mac. did you actually buy this place?

02:44.624 --> 02:48.754
Well. I just put down a deposit.
The rest depends on my grandfather.

02:48.928 --> 02:52.388
-Your grandfather? The grandfather?
-Your grandfather's gonna put up...

02:52.565 --> 02:55.495
-...more of the money?
-Well. if he likes what he sees.

02:55.668 --> 02:58.228
We plan to redecorate
the place ourselves.

02:58.404 --> 03:02.244
The kitchen equipment all works.
Practically no overhead.

03:02.407 --> 03:06.437
-There's practically no ceiling.
-Are we talking about the grandfather...

03:06.612 --> 03:09.672
...who owns the most profitable
import-export business in New York?

03:09.848 --> 03:11.938
-That grandfather?
-The other one's dead. Dan.

03:12.117 --> 03:15.677
-Hey. well. who has a complete set?
-Hi. everybody.

03:15.854 --> 03:18.524
-Hi. Quon Le.
-Ouon Le. what the he--?

03:19.658 --> 03:23.148
Uh. I thought you had some errands to run.
Ouon Le.

03:23.328 --> 03:24.758
I did them all.

03:24.930 --> 03:27.960
Well. gang.
what do you think of the place?

03:29.299 --> 03:35.429
Well. it's very homey.
It has a real lived-in look.

03:35.839 --> 03:38.169
So did Anne Frank's attic.

03:38.341 --> 03:39.501
Gramps is here.

03:39.675 --> 03:45.005
Ouon Le. here. here. Take some money
and go spend it on some trash.

03:45.180 --> 03:46.700
-Go on. now.
-But Grandpa is here.

03:46.881 --> 03:50.681
-No. no. you don't understand. Come on.
-He's down here. I swear.

03:54.055 --> 03:55.885
It's too late.

03:56.991 --> 03:59.221
-There's my boy.
MAC: Hey. Grandpa.

03:59.394 --> 04:01.194
-Mac.
-Ha-ha-ha. You look--

04:01.362 --> 04:03.522
-Hey. you look great.
-Why shouldn't I?

04:03.697 --> 04:05.527
-I'm a Robinson. aren't I?
-That's it.

04:05.699 --> 04:08.719
-Hey there. Mr. Robinson. |'m--
-Tall. scrawny. rather pale.

04:08.901 --> 04:10.671
You must be Judge Stone.

04:11.671 --> 04:13.401
Yeah. that's right.

04:13.571 --> 04:15.341
-This is--
-Hello. Hello. sir.

04:15.507 --> 04:19.637
It is a pleasure to share your airspace.
I'm gonna have that bronzed now.

04:19.810 --> 04:21.301
-Fielding. right?
-Yes. sir.

04:21.478 --> 04:24.179
I apologize. son.
I thought you made him up.

04:24.349 --> 04:26.909
-This is Christine Sullivan.
-Pleasure to meet you. sir.

04:27.085 --> 04:28.545
-Florence Kleiner.
-How are you?

04:28.720 --> 04:30.150
-That's Bull Shannon.
-Sir.

04:30.455 --> 04:31.475
Uh....

04:31.656 --> 04:35.456
Uh. and now I'd like to take you
to the backroom. sir.

04:37.062 --> 04:38.432
Hi. Grandpa.

04:39.129 --> 04:40.929
-The cook?
-Well. sort of.

04:41.098 --> 04:44.828
Howie. take my grandfather
on a tour of the premises.

04:45.002 --> 04:46.562
-My pleasure.
HARRY: Mac.

04:46.737 --> 04:48.707
Does your grandfather know
about Ouon Le?

04:48.872 --> 04:50.932
Well. yes and no.

04:53.744 --> 04:56.184
-Mostly no.
-He doesn't know you're married?

04:56.346 --> 04:59.036
-Oh. you make it sound so extreme.
-Mac. how could you?

04:59.216 --> 05:03.016
-Well. it's complicated.
-What is complicated?

05:03.187 --> 05:06.247
I am so proud to tell everyone
you are my husband.

05:06.423 --> 05:10.293
And you cannot tell your own grandfather
I am your wife?

05:11.195 --> 05:13.095
It slipped my mind?

05:13.263 --> 05:15.563
I lost his phone number?

05:16.299 --> 05:19.759
-I'm scum. and I deserve to die?
-That's the one.

05:19.936 --> 05:21.796
HOWIE:
Real plaster.

05:21.971 --> 05:25.841
-You don't see this kind of thing anymore.
-Thirty-five thousand is our best offer.

05:26.008 --> 05:27.998
Grandpa. there's something
I wanna tell you.

05:28.177 --> 05:32.047
-Mac. don't worry. I'll take care of this.
-No. sir. I don't think you understand.

05:32.215 --> 05:36.075
You see.
we already have an agreement for 80.000.

05:36.252 --> 05:38.452
-Thirty thousand.
-No. you don't understand.

05:38.621 --> 05:41.921
I go down. you go up.
He does not know how to do this.

05:42.091 --> 05:43.531
-Seventy.
-Twenty-five.

05:43.693 --> 05:44.853
-Sixty.
-Twenty.

05:45.026 --> 05:46.316
Sold.

05:48.329 --> 05:50.459
You are my god.

05:50.865 --> 05:52.295
Grandpa.

05:52.466 --> 05:54.936
Mac. please don't mention it.

05:55.503 --> 05:58.943
How about 10 percent down?

05:59.707 --> 06:01.997
Ouon Le is my wife.

06:05.044 --> 06:06.444
I beg your pardon?

06:07.147 --> 06:09.007
Ouon Le is my wife.

06:09.682 --> 06:11.912
You keep that much in checking?

06:12.385 --> 06:14.645
Very pleased to meet you. Grandpa.

06:16.356 --> 06:19.446
Six figures.
The man keeps six figures in checking.

06:19.626 --> 06:21.746
The things I could buy you.

06:21.928 --> 06:24.088
Excuse me. sir.
is that your normal signature?

06:24.263 --> 06:28.263
-Ã¢â‚¬Å“C|a"?
-Why was this marriage kept secret?

06:28.432 --> 06:30.632
-"C|a" may not be legal.
-We||--

06:30.802 --> 06:32.772
I'll tell you why.

06:32.937 --> 06:38.737
Because you know deep down
that it is a disgrace to your family.

06:39.343 --> 06:41.473
Ouon Le is my family.

06:44.048 --> 06:49.448
Then you are no longer my family.

06:58.362 --> 07:02.422
-It's torn. It says. "C|a." and it's torn.
-Grandpa.

07:04.735 --> 07:05.785
Wait a minute.

07:05.970 --> 07:09.700
You don't think this has anything to do
with Ouon Le being Asian. do you?

07:12.276 --> 07:18.366
Honey. you just came this close
to consciousness.

07:22.854 --> 07:25.984
That will be a $50 fine and time served.

07:26.157 --> 07:27.717
Florence.

07:27.892 --> 07:31.522
You made a fashion mistake.
you pay for it.

07:31.963 --> 07:33.333
Next case. Mac.

07:35.565 --> 07:37.685
-Mac?
-What?

07:37.868 --> 07:38.988
Next case.

07:40.470 --> 07:42.910
Oh. yeah. Yeah.

07:43.073 --> 07:47.533
It's right here somewhere.

07:48.345 --> 07:52.175
Sir. perhaps you should call a recess
and talk to him.

07:52.381 --> 07:55.321
Miss Sullivan. I cannot suspend
the proceedings of this court...

07:55.484 --> 07:58.084
...every time someone gets a little upset
around here.

07:58.253 --> 08:01.783
I don't have a grandfather.
He's dead. I killed him.

08:03.391 --> 08:05.491
Five-minute recess.

08:07.694 --> 08:09.534
Don't even think it.

08:17.504 --> 08:19.974
LEON: Fielding.
-Find an expressway. play on it. die.

08:20.140 --> 08:21.940
Fielding.

08:22.109 --> 08:25.769
I've been a good guy all this time
by letting you slide...

08:25.946 --> 08:28.006
...but you're forcing me
into a corner here.

08:28.181 --> 08:30.411
What are you gonna do.
tell your big brother?

08:30.584 --> 08:34.894
Leon. I see that you are closed.

08:35.054 --> 08:37.174
Any way you can fit me in?

08:37.357 --> 08:40.047
Sure thing. Godfather.

08:40.227 --> 08:42.557
I owe you one. Leon.

08:46.300 --> 08:49.240
The scene with the horse
was my favorite.

08:54.474 --> 08:56.814
I'm sorry. sir.
I let my emotions get away from me.

08:56.977 --> 08:59.267
It'll never happen again.

09:03.215 --> 09:04.705
Sorry.

09:04.884 --> 09:06.854
Oh. forget it. Mac. It's nothing.

09:07.019 --> 09:12.389
It was just the only memento from college
I ever kept.

09:12.558 --> 09:15.818
I know my grandfather.
I'll never see him again.

09:15.995 --> 09:18.925
You know that when he's had a chance
to think things through...

09:19.098 --> 09:21.428
-...he's gonna come around.
-We're talking about the man...

09:21.600 --> 09:25.590
...who once waited three days
for me to finish my Brussels sprouts.

09:25.770 --> 09:30.210
He and a former partner
got in a minor argument in 1940...

09:30.375 --> 09:33.105
...and they didn't speak to each other
for 30 years.

09:33.278 --> 09:36.838
Mac. you've always told me
that your grandfather is an admirable man.

09:37.015 --> 09:40.075
So when he realizes
that what he's done is hasty and wrong--

09:40.251 --> 09:42.981
You don't understand. Harry.

09:43.154 --> 09:46.064
He's my grandfather.

09:47.359 --> 09:50.819
And my grandfather is always right.

09:54.699 --> 09:57.669
That man could tell me
why the sky was blue.

09:58.702 --> 10:00.572
He knew everything.

10:01.205 --> 10:03.495
When I was a boy...

10:03.673 --> 10:07.803
...I would come to him
when my world would fall apart...

10:08.378 --> 10:12.748
...and he would tell me a story
and tickle me. hee-hee...

10:13.116 --> 10:15.106
...and it would all come back together.

10:17.153 --> 10:19.493
Do you know
what kind of people those are. Harry?

10:19.655 --> 10:24.345
-Yeah. I think I do.
-Oh. they are your heart and your soul.

10:27.864 --> 10:29.234
IEXHALESI

10:29.431 --> 10:34.231
-And now....
-Hey. Mac. this wasn't your fault.

10:35.270 --> 10:37.240
But does it matter?

10:37.806 --> 10:39.426
He's gone.

10:42.944 --> 10:47.044
If I could just take a walk around the block
before we get started up again. I'll....

10:47.215 --> 10:49.575
Yeah. yeah. sure.

10:50.385 --> 10:52.075
Thanks. Harry.

10:55.390 --> 10:57.190
Hey. Mac. got a great idea.

10:57.359 --> 10:58.789
What say. instead of lunch...

10:58.960 --> 11:02.560
...you and me grab some fresh air
by taking a ride on the Staten Island Ferry?

11:02.731 --> 11:06.761
We'll shake out Mr. Bad-Feeling
and shake in Mr. Good.

11:07.269 --> 11:09.499
Your cuffs are in the top-left drawer.

11:15.577 --> 11:17.907
Oh. poor gUY-

11:19.147 --> 11:23.907
Bull told me how close they were.
I wish there was something we could do.

11:24.086 --> 11:26.346
Maybe there is something. Miss Sullivan.

11:26.521 --> 11:28.421
-Have you got an idea. sir?
-Yes.

11:29.157 --> 11:32.457
Either that. or I'm having a mild stroke.

11:32.627 --> 11:34.817
Well. good luck. sir.

11:36.331 --> 11:38.391
Mr. Bad-Feeling?

11:40.334 --> 11:42.674
You were on the pep squad.
weren't you?

11:46.640 --> 11:49.540
And so I think
Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes...

11:49.710 --> 11:54.840
...put it best when he said.
"Certainty generally is an illusion...

11:55.015 --> 11:59.575
...and repose is not the destiny of man."

12:05.759 --> 12:08.729
I took a doughnut. I'm sorry.

12:10.763 --> 12:12.493
-Your Honor?
-Okay.

12:12.664 --> 12:15.904
Guilty as charged. Suspended sentence.
We'll take a 15-minute recess.

12:16.068 --> 12:19.438
But I don't want anyone
to leave the room. Bye.

12:21.907 --> 12:25.837
You've just been disoriented by the best.

12:32.784 --> 12:34.754
Mr. Robinson.
how the heck are you tonight?

12:34.920 --> 12:37.320
You issued a bench warrant
for my arrest.

12:37.489 --> 12:39.289
So I did.

12:40.092 --> 12:43.692
-Hey. real glad you could come down. Mr.--
-I had no choice.

12:43.862 --> 12:48.992
Some men forced me into a car
with vinyl seats and brought me here.

12:49.468 --> 12:50.988
Vinyl. I hate vinyl too.

12:51.169 --> 12:54.659
-I could have your job for this. Stone.
-I know.

12:55.339 --> 12:56.399
Mr. Robinson...

12:56.574 --> 13:00.374
...now. normally. I make it my policy
not to interfere in family matters...

13:00.545 --> 13:02.065
...but in this particular case--

13:02.245 --> 13:04.365
-Yes. you do.
-What?

13:04.548 --> 13:06.538
You always interfere in family matters.

13:09.786 --> 13:11.116
Excuse me.

13:11.288 --> 13:14.618
Time to go leaf through
the old phone book.

13:17.060 --> 13:20.760
-Now. Mr. Robinson. about Mac--
-He is not getting my money.

13:20.930 --> 13:25.300
Mac does not want your money.
He wants your blessing and your approval.

13:25.467 --> 13:28.597
It means a lot to him.
You mean a lot to him.

13:28.771 --> 13:30.671
-What is he doing here?
-I arrested him.

13:30.839 --> 13:32.329
Oh. God.

13:32.508 --> 13:34.598
Hi. Christine. Hi. Harry.

13:35.844 --> 13:37.114
Hi. Gramps.

13:37.780 --> 13:39.680
You mean. you...?

13:40.583 --> 13:42.743
Him and her...?

13:45.420 --> 13:49.220
Stone. you're insane.

13:50.191 --> 13:55.531
Well. the jury's still out on that one.
believe it or not.

13:55.697 --> 13:57.167
If you'll excuse us.

13:58.633 --> 14:02.803
You want me in here. or should I set up
the machine-gun nest in the hall?

14:02.971 --> 14:06.961
No. Flo. I think they'll be fine.
They're both adults.

14:08.175 --> 14:11.475
There is a fresh pitcher of Kool-Aid
in the fridge.

14:23.890 --> 14:26.380
I loved Roots.

14:28.829 --> 14:33.319
-You arrested my grandfather?
-Yes.

14:33.500 --> 14:35.870
You arrested my grandfather?

14:37.938 --> 14:42.898
-Yes.
-You arrested my grandfather?

14:43.410 --> 14:45.640
I think we've established that now.

14:45.812 --> 14:49.012
You're throwing your career
out the window. You know that. don't you?

14:49.182 --> 14:50.412
Well. maybe.

14:50.583 --> 14:53.283
But then again.
maybe Mac's grandfather will realize...

14:53.452 --> 14:56.912
...that we cannot force others
to live by our rules.

14:57.089 --> 15:00.679
Maybe he'll learn something about himself
that he never knew before.

15:00.860 --> 15:04.800
He'll expand his horizons.
He'll set new goals.

15:13.406 --> 15:15.966
There. there. there.

15:16.742 --> 15:19.112
We'll miss you too.

You sure you don't want any? It's cherry.

15:25.718 --> 15:29.148
-I want my lawyer.
-Okay.

15:29.322 --> 15:33.622
Yeah. Thompson? You wouldn't believe
where I'm calling from.

15:33.793 --> 15:37.323
No. no. A terrible thing has happened.
I've been arrested.

15:38.064 --> 15:40.064
Thompson. I'll get back to you.

15:40.700 --> 15:44.260
Young lady.
what do you think you're doing?

15:44.437 --> 15:47.337
I cannot come between a grandfather
and grandson.

15:47.506 --> 15:50.636
-I must do the honorable thing.
-The honorable thing?

15:50.810 --> 15:55.040
Yes. In my country.
when a wife has disgraced herself...

15:55.214 --> 15:58.674
...she must fling herself
from an 18-story building.

15:58.851 --> 16:01.081
An 18-story building in Vietnam?

16:02.054 --> 16:04.584
It is rare we are successful.

16:04.757 --> 16:06.487
And you want to do this?

16:07.992 --> 16:09.892
Not particularly.

16:10.061 --> 16:11.591
But I have no choice.

16:11.762 --> 16:14.292
-Why?
-Tradition.

16:14.465 --> 16:18.225
Thousands of years of honor.
dignity and sacrifice.

16:18.402 --> 16:21.132
Everything that is anything to my people.

16:23.474 --> 16:25.884
-Don't do it.
-Okay.

16:27.845 --> 16:30.865
I guess I'm not
your old-fashioned kind of girl.

16:31.347 --> 16:33.677
Yes. I can see that.

16:37.286 --> 16:41.516
You put my wife in there with him?

16:41.691 --> 16:45.421
HARRY:
It seemed like a good idea at the time.

16:45.595 --> 16:48.355
Well. I'm sure human sacrifices...

16:48.531 --> 16:52.301
...seemed like a good idea at the time.

16:52.468 --> 16:56.058
Mac. I'm sorry. Forgive me. please.

16:56.239 --> 17:00.639
What's past is past.

-I hope you like it straight. No ice.
-That'll be fine.

17:33.441 --> 17:37.501
You know. this is one of Mac's favorite.
He likes cherry and--

17:37.678 --> 17:39.978
-Grape.
-Yes. grape.

17:40.146 --> 17:42.736
When he was a kid.
we used to have the darnedest time...

17:42.915 --> 17:44.775
...getting him to drink anything else.

17:44.950 --> 17:46.080
I know.

17:46.251 --> 17:49.221
In Vietnam.
my family used to serve him tea.

17:49.387 --> 17:51.217
I don't think he liked it much.

17:51.389 --> 17:54.319
But he was always very polite.
so he'd drink it.

17:54.492 --> 17:56.222
Especially when I made it.

17:58.195 --> 17:59.955
He was in love with you then?

18:00.430 --> 18:04.490
Oh. no. I was just a child at the time.

18:05.402 --> 18:09.032
He used to take care of me
and my family in Vietnam.

18:09.206 --> 18:14.866
It wasn't until I came to this country
that I made him fall in love with me.

18:16.780 --> 18:21.220
Mac taking care
of a whole family in Vietnam.

18:21.384 --> 18:22.914
That's not surprising.

18:24.119 --> 18:28.519
Mac was always
a very compassionate human being.

18:28.691 --> 18:30.991
Even as a child.

18:31.159 --> 18:34.749
In Sunday school.
he'd make these little projects:

18:34.929 --> 18:38.189
biblical scenes and stuff like that.

18:38.366 --> 18:41.826
Mac would always bring home
little scraps of paper.

18:42.003 --> 18:44.473
He hated to throw them away.

18:44.672 --> 18:47.902
He felt sorry for them.

18:48.576 --> 18:52.506
Is that what I am?
A scrap of paper he feels sorry for?

18:52.680 --> 18:57.280
I said he was compassionate. not stupid.

18:58.152 --> 19:01.522

about you too.

-I'll tell you what happened.

19:51.069 --> 19:52.799
I feel great.

19:52.970 --> 19:57.530
I've tried masseurs. chiropractors.
but this little girl is something.

19:57.708 --> 20:00.198
My back hasn't felt this good in years.

-Maybe later. Bull. On a fallen oak.

-Yeah.

that karate stuff on him?

20:11.455 --> 20:14.715
No. Florence. I think she just used
good old-fashioned charm.

It's a natural substance
we women produce in our sweat glands.

20:21.065 --> 20:24.395
It's the first thing to go after the bust.

Everything's straightened out?

-We've reached an understanding.
-We sure have.

However. I would still be glad
to impale myself if you like.

to people who do things like that?

all the great times we had here.

One night. he ate this spicy stuff
and got sick and threw up on the cashier.

-I invited him. He's so cute. isn't he?

22:30.720 --> 22:33.710
Considering he was raised by wolves.
I guess so.

You still owe me. porcupine hair.
