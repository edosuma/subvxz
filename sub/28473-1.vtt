00:21.146 --> 00:22.906
Who was your favorite artist tonight?

00:22.939 --> 00:24.941
You know, I liked ASAP Rocky.

00:25.025 --> 00:26.945
Was that your first time
at Neon Classic?

00:26.985 --> 00:28.028
Uh, no.

00:28.111 --> 00:30.238
Alright. I was about to say
you're welcome.

00:31.823 --> 00:33.343
That was my first time with you.

00:35.243 --> 00:36.619
- You're the best.
- Mm-mm.

00:36.703 --> 00:38.455
Yes! Time for drinks!

00:38.538 --> 00:40.248
Yes, it is.

00:40.832 --> 00:42.500
<i>Cuidado. Cuidado, mi amor.</i>

00:43.209 --> 00:44.209
Be careful.

00:46.421 --> 00:47.981
- You know what I wanna do?
- Huh?

00:48.006 --> 00:48.923
Get on your back.

00:49.007 --> 00:52.343
You always wanna get on my back.
Come on, squat time. What up, dude!

00:55.013 --> 00:56.473
Excuse me, <i>permiso.</i>

00:56.556 --> 01:00.268
Beautiful man down my back,
I have to deliver him to...

01:00.351 --> 01:01.751
No one can smoke in here!

01:01.811 --> 01:03.938
What up, bitches?

01:04.147 --> 01:05.815
- What up, girl?
- What up?

01:05.899 --> 01:07.567
- Drinks, what are we thinking?
- Ooh!

01:07.650 --> 01:10.278
- Whiskey ginger, please.
- You spoke up real quick.

01:10.361 --> 01:12.906
- Uh, vodka soda... Ketel soda.
- All right.

01:12.989 --> 01:14.908
I don't want a hangover.

01:14.991 --> 01:17.077
Can we talk about
Postal Service's set tonight?

01:17.160 --> 01:18.453
- Why is that guy so sad?
- What?

01:18.536 --> 01:21.456
He literally looks like somebody
put glasses on a slice of Wonder Bread.

01:21.539 --> 01:23.419
You talking about that dude
from Postal Service?

01:23.458 --> 01:24.918
- Yeah!
- It's accurate.

01:25.001 --> 01:26.961
- Baby, not you, too.
- Thank you.

01:27.045 --> 01:30.465
All right, toast
to another successful Neon Classic.

01:30.548 --> 01:32.092
Yes, best year yet!

01:35.595 --> 01:37.222
- For your cray-ass kids.
- What?

01:37.305 --> 01:39.766
- You gotta shake it!
- Baby, don't shake it, that's a myth.

01:40.725 --> 01:41.725
It's not a myth.

01:42.227 --> 01:43.227
- Look.
- Oh.

01:45.396 --> 01:47.315
<i>Look at us. We were so happy.</i>

01:48.399 --> 01:49.399
Idiots.

01:49.776 --> 01:51.903
I don't know if you know this, man,
but love is a lie.

01:52.403 --> 01:53.780
Bitch, please.

01:55.365 --> 01:56.365
I'm sorry.

01:56.533 --> 01:58.034
It's just tonight was terrible.

01:58.243 --> 02:01.079
Me and my man broke up, of nine years.
No big deal.

02:01.329 --> 02:03.915
I'm moving to San Francisco,
'cause I got my dream job.

02:04.040 --> 02:05.542
Career girl over here,

02:05.625 --> 02:08.336
- doing the damn thing. Getting it done.
- Okay.

02:08.419 --> 02:09.579
- You know?
- Yeah. Time's up.

02:09.628 --> 02:11.506
And he just didn't want
to do long distance.

02:11.589 --> 02:12.966
- Wow!
- I know.

02:13.341 --> 02:15.468
Really? With FaceTime?

02:15.885 --> 02:17.571
- With everything.
- And high-speed internet?

02:17.595 --> 02:19.848
- That's what I said.
- I mean, that's fucked up.

02:19.973 --> 02:21.307
Thank you, that's what I said.

02:21.391 --> 02:22.559
Why he leave you like that?

02:22.642 --> 02:24.082
He didn't even wanna try.

02:24.144 --> 02:26.980
Why he won't try? Look at you
with your pretty teeth and shit.

02:27.063 --> 02:28.940
Thank you, I told him I have pretty teeth!

02:29.023 --> 02:31.776
Oh, my God! What man
don't wanna put his dick in your mouth

02:31.860 --> 02:34.195
with those pretty teeth
chomping on that dick?

02:34.279 --> 02:35.780
Thank you.

02:36.114 --> 02:39.534
You know, I got to stop
going to Craigslist to find dick.

02:39.784 --> 02:41.327
- You do.
- I do!

02:41.536 --> 02:43.288
- You're beautiful.
- Am I?

02:43.413 --> 02:44.289
Come on, girl.

02:44.372 --> 02:46.791
I feel like we're before-and-after
pictures right now.

02:47.292 --> 02:49.711
Huh! When's this train coming?

02:49.919 --> 02:52.380
I'm kinda over this conversation
to be honest.

02:57.510 --> 02:59.345
What the fuck just happened?

03:59.364 --> 04:00.364
Boo!

04:18.675 --> 04:21.594
You just always fucking walk away.
Really... Real grown-up.

05:02.260 --> 05:03.261
What the fuck?

05:34.500 --> 05:36.336
Fuck, I can't do this.

05:37.211 --> 05:38.046
Why?

05:38.129 --> 05:39.756
Oh, that was super misleading, right?

05:39.839 --> 05:43.259
Like, I want to do this, it's just
I have mad appointments today.

05:43.343 --> 05:48.222
I'm showing this brownstone in Cobble Hill
for three million dollars.

05:48.598 --> 05:50.516
God bless the middle-aged whites.

05:50.600 --> 05:52.727
Keeping a bitch paid,
it's like reparations, you know?

05:55.229 --> 05:57.109
I would love for you to meet
some of my friends.

05:57.815 --> 05:59.015
How would you feel about that?

06:04.113 --> 06:05.990
Mm. Kissing you is nice,

06:06.074 --> 06:08.951
but it doesn't absolve you
from answering me.

06:16.125 --> 06:19.087
- Fuck it. We can talk later.
- Mm-hmm.

06:30.306 --> 06:34.394
Dude... I just went to pet a Chihuahua
outside our building,

06:35.103 --> 06:36.729
and it was a fucking rat.

06:36.813 --> 06:38.523
Oh, my God, I need coffee.

06:38.606 --> 06:40.483
Coffee, coffee, please.

06:40.566 --> 06:42.443
Please, love me right!

06:42.777 --> 06:43.861
- Rough night?
- Oof.

06:43.945 --> 06:47.281
Popped by Casablanca
to meet up with Sasha and Rory, right?

06:47.365 --> 06:49.165
You know, before I went to Leah's
or whatever.

06:49.617 --> 06:52.703
And Sasha's dating this 22-year-old
femme goddess.

06:52.787 --> 06:55.227
Seriously, you gotta check her Instagram.
Oh, my favorite mug.

06:55.289 --> 06:56.874
You love me so much.

06:57.500 --> 07:00.211
I think it's very cute
that you have a girlfriend.

07:00.378 --> 07:02.738
You guys have been together
for like four months now, right?

07:04.382 --> 07:05.842
I don't have a girlfriend.

07:05.925 --> 07:06.925
Leah...

07:07.385 --> 07:10.596
is a girl, who is my friend, who I see...

07:11.389 --> 07:13.433
on consecutive nights,
and whose company I enjoy

07:13.516 --> 07:15.726
more than anyone else's
in the whole entire world.

07:17.228 --> 07:20.064
Whatever. Kindly leave your
heteronormative labels

07:20.273 --> 07:22.650
in a motherfucking box,
to the motherfucking left.

07:22.733 --> 07:24.652
- Thank you!
- You love her.

07:24.735 --> 07:25.653
Whatever.

07:25.736 --> 07:27.321
Morning, ladies.

07:27.405 --> 07:29.824
Wow, did I sleep late or what?

07:29.949 --> 07:31.617
- Mm.
- Morning.

07:32.410 --> 07:34.495
Sorry, morning breath.

07:36.831 --> 07:37.831
I'm gonna...

07:49.177 --> 07:51.345
- Yes?
- You're gonna break up with him, or...

07:51.471 --> 07:55.141
We are just settled into a routine.

07:55.391 --> 07:58.186
We don't have to be all over each other
to prove that we're in love.

07:58.853 --> 08:00.897
Sure, lit, but also you hate him, so...

08:00.980 --> 08:04.275
Remember when we talked about
cleaning your room? Did you not hear me?

08:04.358 --> 08:06.278
Or were you like,
"I'm not gonna do that anyway."

08:06.319 --> 08:08.863
Now, what can I make you for breakfast?

08:09.447 --> 08:10.823
Mwah!

08:10.907 --> 08:11.741
Ooh.

08:11.824 --> 08:12.742
Mwah!

08:12.825 --> 08:15.036
- Oh-ho. That's good.
- Mm-hmm.

08:15.119 --> 08:17.538
- Two of 'em.
- I just creamed my pajamas.

08:17.955 --> 08:19.123
Right in them pajamas.

08:20.333 --> 08:21.417
There's my breakfast.

08:22.168 --> 08:23.544
Oh, there it is.

08:23.628 --> 08:25.796
- Get that. Get that brekkie.
- Mm.

08:25.880 --> 08:27.423
That's all I need.

08:27.507 --> 08:28.507
I love you.

08:28.549 --> 08:31.052
Love you.

08:32.178 --> 08:33.429
Off to the market!

08:34.347 --> 08:35.347
Shut up.

08:35.765 --> 08:37.933
- Go clean your room.
- Um, go clean my room?

08:38.017 --> 08:39.703
- A little bit.
- I love you. Let me just...

08:39.727 --> 08:41.687
Get outta here.

08:41.770 --> 08:43.105
Mm.

08:47.527 --> 08:48.903
Holy fuck!

08:48.986 --> 08:49.986
What?

08:52.114 --> 08:54.534
Ow, shit. Your room!

08:56.244 --> 08:58.120
- Is that Jenny's Instagram?
- Mm-hmm.

08:59.288 --> 09:00.373
No, you don't think.

09:01.123 --> 09:04.043
I mean, I don't know, the last time
she was listening toÂ this joint

09:04.126 --> 09:06.379
was when Matt broke her heart,
senior year.

09:06.671 --> 09:09.632
Maybe she's just <i>listening</i> to it.
Probably nothing.

09:10.925 --> 09:12.718
Yeah, totally.

09:12.802 --> 09:15.555
No. There's no way
that her and Nate broke up.

09:20.476 --> 09:21.476
- Fuck.
- Fuck.

09:23.354 --> 09:24.354
Okay.

09:25.273 --> 09:26.732
Hey!

09:26.816 --> 09:29.360
<i>- Cool, cool, cool. You saw my story.</i>
- How are you?

09:29.443 --> 09:30.486
Who I gotta kill?

09:30.570 --> 09:31.404
You okay?

09:31.487 --> 09:33.531
<i>We broke up last night, but I'm 100% fine.</i>

09:33.614 --> 09:36.951
Like, we... we <i>were</i> together for,
like, nine years, right?

09:37.034 --> 09:38.578
Like, and now we're not.

09:38.661 --> 09:40.329
<i>Anyway, Nate sucks.</i>

09:40.413 --> 09:42.707
And he should fucking die.

09:42.790 --> 09:43.990
<i>- Jesus.
- What?</i>

09:44.041 --> 09:46.210
I'm just kidding, you guys

09:46.335 --> 09:47.169
No, I'm not.

09:47.253 --> 09:48.629
Oh, boy.

09:48.796 --> 09:50.756
Hold onto your nips
because I have some epic news.

09:52.758 --> 09:54.468
I have two words for you:

09:54.552 --> 09:56.178
Neon Classic.

09:56.846 --> 09:58.686
<i>We haven't been to the festival
in three years.</i>

09:58.764 --> 10:00.644
<i>It was just announced that Neon Classic
is doing</i>

10:00.725 --> 10:02.518
a pop-up show at Sony Hall,

10:02.602 --> 10:05.688
and it is going to be fucking awesome.
Okay?

10:05.771 --> 10:07.607
Secret show, secret headliner.

10:07.732 --> 10:11.277
<i>I got us three all-access passes,
courtesy of the </i> Rolling Stone.

10:11.360 --> 10:12.987
Yes, you do, bitch!

10:13.070 --> 10:15.590
You know crowds make me uncomfortable
in this political climate.

10:15.615 --> 10:17.074
- Ow! That hurt.
<i>- </i> Putitas!

10:17.158 --> 10:20.202
Basically, I want you to call your work
and tell them you have your period

10:20.286 --> 10:21.537
and come over to my apartment.

10:21.621 --> 10:23.056
- Done.
- I can't do that. I'm sorry.

10:23.080 --> 10:24.832
<i>- Blair!</i>
- I'm sorry. I'm running point

10:24.915 --> 10:26.875
on a very important tastemakers' brunch
next week,

10:26.917 --> 10:28.878
I'm presenting my Instagram
strategy today,

10:28.961 --> 10:30.481
and I can't miss the hashtag roll-out.

10:30.546 --> 10:33.341
Everything you said just like... sucked.

10:33.466 --> 10:37.011
Did you mean the roll-out of the hashtag,
or did you just hashtag the word roll-out?

10:37.303 --> 10:40.848
<i>Fine. I will just come over
after your meeting for lunch.</i>

10:41.057 --> 10:43.643
<i>- Erin, can you get some OJ for mimosas?</i>
- Yup.

10:43.893 --> 10:45.645
Oh, we also need champagne though.

10:46.729 --> 10:50.524
Because all I got is this, and it may not
be here by the time you get here.

10:50.608 --> 10:52.693
<i>You know what I'm saying?</i>

10:52.777 --> 10:55.237
Okay, I love you both. I love you, bye!

10:55.321 --> 10:59.492
- Bye-ee.
- Love you, bye-ee!

10:59.784 --> 11:01.619
You know the beginning
of a disaster movie,

11:01.702 --> 11:04.246
like, right before the girl
who looks like me dies,

11:04.330 --> 11:06.770
and, like, right when the girl
who looks like you walk outside

11:06.832 --> 11:10.795
and be like, "Oh, my God,
look how crazy the sky looks!"?

11:11.587 --> 11:12.963
This feels like that.

11:45.579 --> 11:46.579
Ow!

11:52.294 --> 11:54.296
Hey! Yup! Yup!

11:59.260 --> 12:00.820
What is this song? Do I know this song?

12:03.472 --> 12:04.472
Winter break,

12:05.641 --> 12:06.726
junior year.

12:09.145 --> 12:10.145
Fuck that.

12:10.521 --> 12:12.523
- You want me...?
- Let it play.

12:22.032 --> 12:24.034
- What is this song?
- I love this song.

12:26.078 --> 12:28.718
Blair, did you do drugs with
the study-abroad kids in the bathroom?

12:29.457 --> 12:30.750
No. Maybe.

12:32.084 --> 12:33.335
No one connects anymore.

12:33.419 --> 12:36.088
They hook up and move on,
but what happened to finding a soulmate?

12:36.922 --> 12:39.133
You're only as valuable
as your profile picture now.

12:40.342 --> 12:41.844
You sound like an idiot, dude.

12:42.386 --> 12:43.429
You sound like an idiot.

12:44.054 --> 12:45.848
Hey, we can't all crush puss like you do.

12:47.266 --> 12:49.586
You know the reason why
you're having a problem with girls?

12:49.935 --> 12:50.935
Why?

12:50.978 --> 12:53.272
You say shit like "crush puss."

12:56.317 --> 12:58.157
You know people can see
that you're doing that.

12:58.194 --> 13:02.156
Ah! It's just, when it grows back in,
it just all grows towards each other.

13:02.656 --> 13:04.366
I'm such a <i>pendeja.</i> Guys.

13:04.784 --> 13:07.384
Matt's probably not even gonna be here.
What am I even doing here?

13:07.453 --> 13:09.413
I BBM'd him two days ago
and still hasn't read it,

13:09.455 --> 13:11.375
but he went on BBM today,
changed his name, bang,

13:11.457 --> 13:13.584
it's like I'm supposed to be like
a dumbass?

13:13.667 --> 13:15.667
Are you acting like I don't see
that you're active?

13:15.711 --> 13:16.921
- What the fuck?
- Right?

13:17.713 --> 13:19.673
Well, at least y'all got prospects.

13:20.132 --> 13:22.676
- What about that girl right down there?
- No.

13:22.760 --> 13:24.440
She's been looking
at you all night.

13:24.470 --> 13:25.846
No, undergrad girls are lame.

13:26.222 --> 13:28.057
On OkCupid I put my stuff for forty-up.

13:28.808 --> 13:30.309
Older women get me, man.

13:30.392 --> 13:32.312
It's like they're fucking
their son's hot friend.

13:33.437 --> 13:35.940
- You stay away from my mother.
- Yeah, yeah.

13:38.359 --> 13:39.359
Okay.

13:40.319 --> 13:43.322
- Did he just... Did he just hear me?
- Yeah, he did.

13:43.906 --> 13:45.666
- Now he's coming over here.
- Is he?

13:45.699 --> 13:47.886
- He's walking over here.
- Who's walking over here?

13:47.910 --> 13:48.911
The guy who...

13:48.994 --> 13:50.079
The guy who...

13:50.162 --> 13:52.164
Smoked... crayons.

13:52.289 --> 13:54.667
Yellow... crayons.

13:54.750 --> 13:55.750
I don't know.

13:57.795 --> 13:58.796
Nice save, Blair.

14:01.382 --> 14:03.551
Oh, that's some strong, prolonged
eye contact,

14:03.634 --> 14:05.219
- so we're gonna bounce.
- Yep.

14:06.512 --> 14:07.512
Nate.

14:08.472 --> 14:10.599
Hi. Jenny. Nice to meet you...

14:13.936 --> 14:15.229
Oh, I get it.

14:15.312 --> 14:18.107
That's the guy that
you came here to meet originally, huh?

14:19.149 --> 14:21.819
What? No, I don't... I don't care.
I don't know... I don't...

14:21.902 --> 14:23.571
Psh! I do not know...

14:25.322 --> 14:26.156
who that is.

14:26.240 --> 14:29.410
Who is he? I'm so convinced right now
by what you're doing.

14:35.958 --> 14:38.002
You know what?
Fuck that guy you don't know.

14:38.085 --> 14:40.254
All right? Me and you, let's dance.

14:40.629 --> 14:42.298
Let's make him a little jelly.

14:43.215 --> 14:44.925
Yes, girl!

14:56.312 --> 14:58.331
- My armpit!
- You're taking too long.

15:05.571 --> 15:07.281
- You smell good.
- Yeah?

15:08.073 --> 15:09.713
That's great
'cause I didn't shower today.

15:09.783 --> 15:11.827
- That's what I'm talking about.
- Yes!

15:22.838 --> 15:24.548
You got anything?

15:24.632 --> 15:28.093
What, like condoms? Or AIDS?

15:28.761 --> 15:30.201
I don't think I've ever heard "AIDS"

15:30.262 --> 15:31.889
said to me while I was making out.

15:31.972 --> 15:32.972
You're welcome.

15:40.105 --> 15:41.857
Praise the Lord.

15:58.165 --> 15:59.291
Mm.

16:01.794 --> 16:03.837
Holy shit.

16:07.967 --> 16:09.343
Holy fucking shit!

16:12.721 --> 16:13.721
Oh.

16:14.473 --> 16:15.473
Wow!

16:16.475 --> 16:17.475
Give me these.

16:28.404 --> 16:29.404
Oh.

16:30.864 --> 16:32.282
Hey, Jared, what's up?

16:37.955 --> 16:38.955
Yeah.

16:39.999 --> 16:41.291
Yeah, yeah, nope.

16:42.126 --> 16:44.003
No worries. It's totally cool.

16:46.005 --> 16:47.005
Mm-hmm.

16:47.840 --> 16:49.842
Oh, I am super excited
to get out there as well.

16:51.010 --> 16:52.010
Yeah.

16:52.970 --> 16:54.179
Yeah, okay, cool, great.

16:56.181 --> 16:57.808
- Bye-bye-bye.
- Ha!

16:58.308 --> 17:00.561
Ah! You just quoted NSYNC.

17:00.644 --> 17:01.478
Fuck!

17:01.562 --> 17:03.397
- Fuck, fuck, fuck!
- What?

17:03.939 --> 17:06.066
The list for Neon Classic
is tapped out.

17:06.150 --> 17:08.109
Well, look, dude. It's fine. It's okay.

17:08.694 --> 17:11.113
We could just sit here and chill
and drink.

17:11.195 --> 17:12.906
What? No, no, we're going.

17:12.990 --> 17:14.950
We're going to the show, okay?

17:15.034 --> 17:16.076
I leave in a week.

17:16.535 --> 17:20.539
And then I turn 30, and then I die,
probably, and I...

17:21.415 --> 17:24.126
can't stop moving,
or else I think about, um...

17:28.338 --> 17:30.174
I can't leave New York City like this.

17:30.257 --> 17:31.341
This is the end of an era.

17:31.425 --> 17:33.653
You, me, Blair, we've all been caught up
in our own shit.

17:33.677 --> 17:35.237
I need one last epic day with my girls.

17:35.262 --> 17:36.430
We owe it to the city.

17:36.930 --> 17:37.930
Yes, queen.

17:38.265 --> 17:40.825
Trying to make me feel feelings
like a motherfucking Pixar movie.

17:40.851 --> 17:43.270
- I'm not doing it.
- Okay, so I'm gonna go get dressed,

17:43.353 --> 17:45.522
and you are gonna email
everybody that you know

17:45.814 --> 17:47.054
that could get us on that list.

17:47.107 --> 17:48.108
All right.

17:48.233 --> 17:50.819
Uh, Jenny, I don't... I don't know nobody.

17:50.944 --> 17:52.362
I don't... I would email you.

17:52.446 --> 17:54.323
- I don't know anybody.
- Okay, new plan.

17:54.406 --> 17:56.950
We need all hands on deck.
We're gonna go to Blair's office,

17:57.034 --> 17:58.954
and tell them that her mom died
so she can leave.

17:59.036 --> 18:00.370
Jesus Christ!

18:00.454 --> 18:01.538
Okay, fine, her aunt.

18:01.622 --> 18:04.583
I'm afraid you don't understand
what's fucked up about this suggestion,

18:04.666 --> 18:06.311
- but...
- You scour Craigslist for tickets.

18:06.335 --> 18:08.975
We need more booze for today.
We should get some Molly for tonight.

18:09.004 --> 18:11.124
And then we go to Neon Classic.
We're gonna go mobile!

18:12.549 --> 18:13.717
And I'm gonna get dressed.

18:23.185 --> 18:24.812
Loving this look, BT-dubs.

18:25.312 --> 18:28.440
It's like Liz Lemon fucked
the Salvation Army.

18:29.316 --> 18:30.316
- Thank you.
- Mm-hm.

18:30.776 --> 18:32.236
- Today, I'm free.
- Yeah.

18:32.361 --> 18:35.239
We need big numbers here, okay?
If they don't have an M by their name,

18:35.322 --> 18:36.323
I don't want to see them.

18:37.491 --> 18:38.491
Ugh!

18:38.742 --> 18:41.262
She's doing that thing where she stands
with her shoulders back.

18:41.411 --> 18:44.291
Good posture is so pretentious.
It's like, alright, whatever, we get you.

18:44.414 --> 18:46.476
You did ballet 'til you
were like in the ninth grade.

18:46.500 --> 18:48.585
At least we're gonna have to really do...

18:50.087 --> 18:51.087
She sees us.

18:51.380 --> 18:52.381
She look pissed?

18:52.923 --> 18:53.923
Ooh...

18:54.716 --> 18:55.716
Yeah.

18:57.678 --> 18:59.221
And that would be... um...

19:01.682 --> 19:03.517
Ah, fuck it.

19:06.812 --> 19:09.273
Hey, Blair, can I talk to you for a sec?

19:09.815 --> 19:10.732
It's an emergency.

19:10.816 --> 19:12.234
Your aunt died.

19:16.071 --> 19:17.281
Oh, my God.

19:17.573 --> 19:18.573
Blair.

19:19.575 --> 19:21.285
Was it Aunt Camille or Aunt Denise?

19:21.368 --> 19:23.495
Oh, don't tell me, it's too devastating.

19:23.579 --> 19:24.621
I'm so sorry.

19:25.497 --> 19:27.332
If you guys could just excuse me

19:28.000 --> 19:28.834
for a moment.

19:28.917 --> 19:30.637
So sorry, I'll be right back.

19:30.669 --> 19:33.839
Go. Um, and I'm gonna pick it up
on page, um...

19:34.131 --> 19:35.841
five of the presentation.

19:35.924 --> 19:38.510
So, let's talk a little bit about

19:38.594 --> 19:42.848
visual merchandising
on Instagram specifically.

19:42.931 --> 19:44.516
What are you doing here?

19:44.600 --> 19:46.720
And why did you just tell my office
that my aunt died?

19:46.935 --> 19:47.935
Oh, wait...

19:48.270 --> 19:49.354
Did Aunt Camille die?

19:49.479 --> 19:51.690
AC is chillin'.

19:52.316 --> 19:55.277
Jenny, on the other hand,
is in horrible shape.

19:55.611 --> 19:56.612
She needs us.

19:57.613 --> 20:00.699
Our bestie is out there drinking
champagne from a bottle of green juice

20:00.782 --> 20:02.117
that still has green juice in it.

20:02.201 --> 20:03.368
Oh, fuck.

20:05.495 --> 20:07.539
Wait, it's like a green-juice mimosa.

20:08.248 --> 20:10.250
- That's kinda genius.
- She made me try it.

20:10.334 --> 20:12.794
It's fucking disgusting.
I am drowning out here.

20:13.128 --> 20:14.546
I need you. She needs you.

20:15.005 --> 20:17.507
Okay, okay.
Of course, yes, I'm gonna come.

20:17.591 --> 20:20.928
I just... Shit. I need to tell my office
that I'm gonna...

20:21.970 --> 20:22.970
plan a funeral?

20:23.180 --> 20:25.408
- That's really fucked up.
- Love you. Meet you downstairs.

20:25.432 --> 20:27.935
- I hate you. Get out of my office.
- Mm-hmm. Love you, boo.

20:28.602 --> 20:29.602
Love you.

20:30.687 --> 20:31.687
Damn it.

20:31.939 --> 20:34.099
Why haven't we heard
from the Craigslist guy yet?

20:34.149 --> 20:35.984
Hey, let's focus on the positive, okay?

20:36.360 --> 20:39.780
I am so amped for you and this new job.
You're about to slay it.

20:39.863 --> 20:43.408
Aww. It's crazy, y'all.
They gave me a staff of people, like...

20:44.409 --> 20:47.055
How did I convince them that I should have
that much responsibility?

20:47.079 --> 20:50.040
Fuck that modesty shit.
You are the dopest writer we know.

20:50.332 --> 20:51.416
- A hundred percent.
- Aww.

20:51.500 --> 20:55.587
You have this really unique way
of describing music that's very special.

20:55.671 --> 20:57.798
- You believe that?
- Yeah.

21:00.217 --> 21:02.010
- Oh, shit.
- Her pants, though.

21:02.344 --> 21:04.471
- I have to take this. I'm so sorry.
- Yeah, go on.

21:05.722 --> 21:06.556
Go for Blair.

21:06.640 --> 21:08.100
Oh, shit.

21:08.225 --> 21:11.353
- Now my boss is... calling me.
- Hey, text me when you're done.

21:11.436 --> 21:12.771
- I'm gonna go for a walk.
- Okay.

21:12.854 --> 21:14.356
Hey, Martha.

21:14.439 --> 21:16.359
Yeah, I feel better.
What up, doll?

21:16.441 --> 21:17.721
You get those numbers
I sent you?

21:32.374 --> 21:33.374
<i>Okay.</i>

21:34.001 --> 21:34.835
<i>It's done.</i>

21:34.918 --> 21:36.128
- Done?
- Yep.

21:36.211 --> 21:38.630
- Alright, let's see it.
- I mean, it's super rough,

21:38.714 --> 21:40.733
- and it's probably gonna be shit...
- Let's see it.

21:40.757 --> 21:43.677
But it's not gonna be...
but there are mad different little... Oh!

21:45.262 --> 21:46.262
All right.

21:46.888 --> 21:47.888
Okay.

21:51.476 --> 21:52.476
Wow.

21:53.437 --> 21:55.022
This is really fucking good, Jen.

21:56.189 --> 21:58.150
That dude would be crazy not to hire you.

21:58.817 --> 21:59.817
Yeah.

22:00.193 --> 22:01.028
You mean that?

22:01.194 --> 22:02.487
- Yes.
- Thank you.

22:02.571 --> 22:05.699
I mean, I do feel confident about it.
I definitely think it's in a better spot.

22:05.782 --> 22:09.411
And he said that if he liked it,
then he would start publishing me ASAP.

22:09.494 --> 22:12.289
And it's only 20 bucks a post,
but fuck it, right?

22:12.372 --> 22:15.751
Because I'll... I'll be able to write
about the music I wanna write about.

22:15.834 --> 22:18.479
I'll be able to introduce you to people,
and this is the first step.

22:18.503 --> 22:21.173
I can freelance now, and then after
I graduate, I get on staff,

22:21.256 --> 22:24.509
become an editor, and, I don't know,
maybe I can run my own thing one day.

22:25.344 --> 22:26.553
You're amazing, Jen.

22:27.471 --> 22:28.513
Fucking amazing.

22:28.638 --> 22:29.681
It's insane.

22:29.765 --> 22:32.976
I mean, you know what you want to do,
you're putting your all into it,

22:33.060 --> 22:35.187
and you just going forth
and doing it. It's...

22:38.315 --> 22:40.609
Um... I don't know
what the fuck I wanna do.

22:40.901 --> 22:42.903
- Hey! No, uh-uh.
- What?

22:42.986 --> 22:45.822
No, no, no. Don't do that.
Come on, you'll figure it out.

22:45.947 --> 22:48.075
Yeah, maybe. I don't know.

22:50.702 --> 22:52.422
You wanna be super corny with me
real quick?

22:52.454 --> 22:54.373
- What?
- Can we make this our spot?

22:55.165 --> 22:56.833
- Hell, yeah!
- Hell, yeah?

22:56.917 --> 22:58.418
In fact, this is <i>our</i> spot.

22:58.502 --> 23:02.089
- Everybody, you, you! This is <i>our</i> spot!
- Baby! Shh!

23:02.214 --> 23:05.384
No, fuck that. You know what? You want
to know how we can do it? I should, uh...

23:05.467 --> 23:07.107
- Mark it. I'm gonna mark it down.
- What?

23:07.177 --> 23:09.096
Vandalism?

23:09.596 --> 23:12.182
Ooh, I love it
when you're dangerous, baby.

23:12.307 --> 23:13.934
Put a little happy face here.

23:17.479 --> 23:18.522
Forever!

23:48.760 --> 23:49.594
Hey, ladies.

23:49.678 --> 23:51.680
- Hey, good walk?
- Yeah.

23:52.931 --> 23:55.934
- Oh, Craigslist bro just texted back.
- Yeah?

23:56.017 --> 23:58.186
Three VIP wristbands.

23:58.270 --> 24:00.814
- Woo!
- "Come by anytime after three. No dudes."

24:00.897 --> 24:02.482
- He wrote "no dudes"?
- Mm-hmm.

24:02.566 --> 24:03.566
Oy!

24:03.733 --> 24:05.902
Wait, he's selling them for $500?

24:05.986 --> 24:08.697
Don't worry. I got an advance
from <i>Rolling Stone</i> for my moving,

24:08.780 --> 24:10.031
and I'm going to share

24:10.115 --> 24:11.241
- with the two of you.
- Yes.

24:11.324 --> 24:13.326
I got your tickets. I got your tickets.
I got it.

24:13.410 --> 24:15.370
I feel like this might be
an irresponsible choice.

24:15.412 --> 24:17.890
I really want us to think about
the choices we're making today,

24:17.914 --> 24:19.416
because it seems irresponsible.

24:19.499 --> 24:21.460
Says the woman who spent $400
on mink eyelashes.

24:21.543 --> 24:23.253
- I'm just saying.
- These are real.

24:23.336 --> 24:28.258
- I don't believe you!
- I'm gonna miss this so hard! Ah!

24:28.341 --> 24:30.427
You did not just find that in your pocket
right now.

24:30.510 --> 24:32.512
I did, and I have no idea how long
it's been there.

24:32.679 --> 24:33.679
That seems safe.

24:33.805 --> 24:34.639
It's fine.

24:34.764 --> 24:35.849
Blair, calm down.

24:36.349 --> 24:38.269
- Weed is like ketchup, it doesn't go bad.
- Yep.

24:38.351 --> 24:39.478
Ketchup goes bad.

24:39.644 --> 24:42.564
Mm. Then you should definitely
not use our ketchup.

24:44.191 --> 24:47.295
Can we at least move out of the middle
of the street if we're gonna smoke weed?

24:47.319 --> 24:49.404
- Stoop, stoop, stoop!
- Did you just say "we"?

24:49.488 --> 24:51.573
Does Bad Blair want to come out and play?

24:51.656 --> 24:54.284
No, Bad Blair does not
want to come out and play. It is noon.

24:54.367 --> 24:57.245
Blair, please, this dooby just literally
came from the heavens.

24:57.329 --> 24:59.956
This could be one of our last times ever
doing this together.

25:00.040 --> 25:01.920
- Amen.
- I mean, when are we gonna have this...

25:02.334 --> 25:04.211
opportunity to do this.

25:04.586 --> 25:05.586
I am alone.

25:05.670 --> 25:07.005
I got my ass broken up with.

25:07.088 --> 25:09.216
- Oh, my God.
- I'm gonna leave to California.

25:09.299 --> 25:10.634
I'm not gonna see y'all.

25:10.717 --> 25:14.012
I mean, really, this is
a memory that you're gonna pass up?

25:14.095 --> 25:16.056
- Oh, Jesus!
- Okay, yay.

25:16.139 --> 25:18.600
A memory. A memory.

25:18.683 --> 25:19.893
That was a great performance.

25:19.976 --> 25:20.977
- Thank you.
- I'm sorry.

25:21.728 --> 25:22.938
These are real tears though.

25:24.981 --> 25:26.691
Yes!

25:26.775 --> 25:29.861
Bad Blair! Bad Blair!
Bad Blair! Bad Blair! Bad Blair!

25:30.195 --> 25:31.696
Blair, boo-boo.

25:32.364 --> 25:34.324
Boo, watching you take down
all these carbs

25:34.407 --> 25:36.287
has been the highlight
of my whole, entire life.

25:36.368 --> 25:37.577
I hate you. Both of you.

25:37.661 --> 25:39.788
Me? What I do? I didn't do nothing.

25:42.999 --> 25:45.710
How is Matt Lasher in this
motherfucking restaurant right now?

25:45.794 --> 25:46.794
Well.

25:46.836 --> 25:48.713
Oh, my God, look who it is.

25:49.089 --> 25:50.632
Jenny, wow, it's been a while.

25:50.882 --> 25:52.842
Blair, you look great. Erin!

25:53.260 --> 25:54.500
You still hate me. That's fine.

25:54.553 --> 25:56.763
So, what's up?
You girls going to Neon Classic?

25:56.846 --> 25:57.973
Yes. Yes, we are.

25:58.056 --> 26:00.141
You know, my team's doing the event.
You got list?

26:00.225 --> 26:03.186
It's like pretty crazy. Everyone
and their mother is trying to get in.

26:03.270 --> 26:05.021
Like, my mom literally texted me.

26:05.105 --> 26:06.189
Left her unread.

26:06.273 --> 26:09.067
I actually just got a job with
<i>Rolling Stone,</i> so I think we're good.

26:09.150 --> 26:10.902
We got like channels that we can
go through.

26:10.986 --> 26:13.905
Cool, if you have any problems
or something, just, you know,

26:13.989 --> 26:14.823
slide into my DMs.

26:14.906 --> 26:16.032
Oh, good Lord.

26:17.284 --> 26:18.827
Bye. Good seeing you, Jen.

26:19.369 --> 26:21.454
What the fuck, dude?

26:21.538 --> 26:24.749
You need to get some lubricant,
and slide into his motherfucking DMs.

26:24.833 --> 26:26.553
What if the Craigslist tickets
fall through?

26:26.585 --> 26:28.920
What? We're fine. We're gonna be fine.
It's gonna be fine.

26:29.004 --> 26:30.422
Got it.

26:30.547 --> 26:31.715
You need to fuck Matt.

26:31.798 --> 26:33.717
He's kinda the perfect rebound.

26:34.009 --> 26:35.844
It's only been a day. You need to grieve.

26:35.927 --> 26:38.054
What you need is someone
to fuck the Nate out of you.

26:38.138 --> 26:41.975
Grief is an emotion best served
with a side of stiff dick.

26:42.434 --> 26:43.518
Erin...

26:43.602 --> 26:46.730
I love you, but you've never even been
in a long-term relationship.

26:47.397 --> 26:48.231
Blair.

26:48.315 --> 26:49.399
I love you,

26:49.482 --> 26:52.652
but you and Will are not exactly
the second coming of Oprah and Gayle.

26:52.736 --> 26:53.737
You know what I'm saying?

26:53.820 --> 26:55.697
You need to get fucked more than she does.

26:55.780 --> 26:57.032
- Me?
- Uh-huh.

26:57.741 --> 26:58.741
I fuck!

27:00.368 --> 27:02.454
I fuck, okay? Definitely.

27:02.537 --> 27:04.080
You don't even fuck yourself.

27:04.164 --> 27:05.724
Tried to use your Rabbit the other day.

27:05.749 --> 27:07.667
That shit is dusty
and the batteries are dead.

27:07.751 --> 27:10.879
That's disgusting.
I feel very attacked right now.

27:10.962 --> 27:14.007
Would someone uptight give you the money
to get the good Molly from the guy

27:14.090 --> 27:15.970
that lives above the McDonald's
near the bridge?

27:16.009 --> 27:16.843
Hype Molly?

27:16.926 --> 27:20.305
Yes, Hype Molly for us all,
courtesy of your loosest friend.

27:20.388 --> 27:21.388
No.

27:21.598 --> 27:23.683
Yeah, I heard it as I said it. Top grade.

27:23.767 --> 27:24.767
Ah.

27:26.394 --> 27:27.729
What up, you got stress-rhea?

27:28.355 --> 27:29.397
That was one time.

27:30.106 --> 27:33.276
I think it's a stretch calling
an entire year of college one time.

27:33.360 --> 27:35.560
If anyone's gonna have
stress diarrhea, it's me.

27:35.612 --> 27:37.172
Let's make this fast and get to Hype's.

27:37.405 --> 27:39.407
I'm putting my keys
in-between my fingers.

27:39.658 --> 27:41.576
Just in case this guy tries
any funny business.

27:41.660 --> 27:42.744
Yes, bitch.

27:42.827 --> 27:44.704
You shank that motherfucker
with our mail key.

27:46.331 --> 27:47.791
Hey, yo! What up?

27:48.833 --> 27:51.795
- It's like Supreme shat out an apartment.
- Welcome, welcome!

27:51.920 --> 27:52.920
Come on in.

27:54.005 --> 27:56.841
Hey, I'm Mikey, by the way,
and y'all are...

27:57.217 --> 27:59.344
- Jenny, Blair, Erin.
- Jenny, Blair.

27:59.427 --> 28:00.762
Erin, wassup?

28:01.096 --> 28:02.972
Welcome to my crib, come on in.

28:03.056 --> 28:05.558
You can smoke anything on the table
that you want.

28:05.642 --> 28:08.186
Everybody always asks,
"How do you afford this place?"

28:08.269 --> 28:10.730
My parents got it for me two years ago

28:10.814 --> 28:13.108
before I broke off contact with them
completely.

28:13.191 --> 28:15.694
Oh, I got pasta over there, by the way,
if you want some.

28:15.819 --> 28:17.219
No, we just ate a really big lunch.

28:17.278 --> 28:19.572
Blair, I mean, you can't say no
to a plate.

28:19.656 --> 28:22.450
That's the spirit.
Hey, what Harry Potter house are y'all?

28:22.742 --> 28:23.618
And don't lie.

28:23.743 --> 28:26.329
- I think we're all Ravenclaw.
- Bitch, please. I'm Hufflepuff.

28:26.413 --> 28:28.093
Blair low-key Slytherin.

28:28.164 --> 28:30.917
Technically, I identify as a Slytherin
with a Ravenclaw moon.

28:31.334 --> 28:33.837
Yo, that is such a Slytherin thing
of you to say.

28:33.920 --> 28:35.296
I'm Gryffindor, by the way.

28:35.380 --> 28:36.589
Nobody asked, but...

28:36.673 --> 28:38.049
Wait. Whoa.

28:38.133 --> 28:40.051
- This ain't what I think it is.
- No, it is.

28:41.386 --> 28:44.347
Ooh-wee!
This is the ace of spades of weed, y'all.

28:44.639 --> 28:46.808
Beyoncé shmokes this weed.

28:46.891 --> 28:51.104
That is, deadass, the best weed
in the game right there.

28:51.187 --> 28:53.231
I got that shit from Mike Dean's dude.

28:53.314 --> 28:55.150
I only smoke shit that rappers do.

28:55.442 --> 28:58.319
I also got some shit that <i>will</i> give
you a seizure, so be careful.

28:58.403 --> 29:00.447
It's mild, like the flavor of the weed.

29:00.530 --> 29:03.199
The seizure's not mild, it's <i>very</i> strong.

29:03.533 --> 29:05.493
- Oh!
- Oh, my goodness, a dog!

29:05.577 --> 29:07.412
- Come back to me. Who is that?
- Hey!

29:07.495 --> 29:09.664
This is... Barbra Streisand.

29:09.748 --> 29:13.209
Hey! The cutest little baby in the game.

29:13.293 --> 29:15.003
You named your dog "Barbra Streisand"?

29:15.128 --> 29:18.173
Oh, yeah. Why would I not name him
"Barbra Streisand"?

29:18.256 --> 29:21.468
She's a legend, you know?
And I love female directors, for real.

29:21.551 --> 29:23.845
because I truly do believe,
like, Time Is Up.

29:23.928 --> 29:25.638
As a matter of fact, Time <i>Been</i> Up.

29:25.722 --> 29:26.722
You know? We're late.

29:26.765 --> 29:28.183
And <i> Lady Bird? </i> I love that shit.

29:28.349 --> 29:29.184
I loved <i> Lady Bird.</i>

29:29.267 --> 29:30.727
You <i>would</i> love <i>Lady Bird.</i>

29:30.810 --> 29:32.228
That's so her, right?

29:32.312 --> 29:35.857
I feel like I know y'all, like...
Y'all are so... I love you guys.

29:35.940 --> 29:37.740
For real, like, y'all want something
to drink?

29:37.776 --> 29:41.529
I'm drinking this expensive-ass tequila,
but you gotta douse this shit in Sprite,

29:41.613 --> 29:43.093
because it low-key tastes like booty.

29:43.198 --> 29:44.758
No offense to the ass-eating community.

29:44.783 --> 29:46.910
No, thank you.
Uh, we just really want the tickets.

29:46.993 --> 29:47.827
Right!

29:47.911 --> 29:49.204
The tickets...

29:49.287 --> 29:51.748
Um, so...
It's, like, really funny, actually.

29:51.831 --> 29:53.958
My boy, Victor, came through earlier,

29:54.292 --> 29:55.877
and I gave <i>him</i> the tickets,

29:56.211 --> 29:58.129
and then y'all came, and I was like,

29:58.755 --> 30:01.049
"Oh, hold up," like,
"They kinda cute," like,

30:01.174 --> 30:03.885
"Let's see where this goes,
maybe we can smoke a little something,

30:03.968 --> 30:07.305
drink a little something, you know,
like maybe, we can fuck on each other."

30:07.388 --> 30:08.681
Right.

30:10.934 --> 30:12.227
Right.

30:13.478 --> 30:15.915
- You ain't got no tickets.
- Yeah, no, I ain't got the tickets.

30:15.939 --> 30:18.149
No.

30:19.400 --> 30:22.111
- Let me at him! one minute! Let me just...
- Stop! Stop!

30:22.195 --> 30:23.071
No!

30:23.154 --> 30:26.449
No, you can't play like that, man.
I got early-onset osteoporosis.

30:26.533 --> 30:29.744
Look. Look at my wrist.
I ain't got no bones in my wrist, man.

30:29.828 --> 30:31.508
I was born with no bones in my left wrist.

30:31.579 --> 30:34.207
I'm taking this, okay?

30:34.290 --> 30:36.209
I woulda gave it to you if you asked.

30:36.960 --> 30:38.795
But if you want to live your life
by violence,

30:39.420 --> 30:40.420
go ahead.

30:43.550 --> 30:44.801
Weirdo! Ugh!

30:48.221 --> 30:49.514
- Yo.
- Hm?

30:49.597 --> 30:51.057
I stole the Beyoncé weed, too.

30:51.850 --> 30:54.727
- Oh, Bad Blair!
- She back.

30:56.104 --> 30:58.273
Ah, fuck it. I'm DMing Matt.

30:58.356 --> 31:00.441
Uh-huh.
And if that doesn't work, we could

31:00.525 --> 31:01.901
reach out to...

31:01.985 --> 31:03.278
What's that one dude's name...

31:03.361 --> 31:06.739
What is this? Okay, we are...

31:06.823 --> 31:08.116
What are you doing?

31:08.199 --> 31:09.033
Hannah!

31:09.117 --> 31:09.951
Oh, shit!

31:10.034 --> 31:11.369
Nate's cousin, Hannah?

31:11.452 --> 31:13.663
Fuck! I bet you she loves
that we broke up.

31:13.746 --> 31:15.746
Oh, she's always calling me,
"sweetie, sweetheart."

31:15.790 --> 31:18.626
- She's coming.
- No, she's not. She's... Oh, yeah, she is.

31:18.710 --> 31:20.003
- Okay.
- Erin?

31:20.503 --> 31:22.589
- What up, girl?
- Hi!

31:22.922 --> 31:24.007
What's happening?

31:24.924 --> 31:25.924
Jenny, is that you?

31:26.175 --> 31:28.177
No. Huh? What?

31:29.721 --> 31:30.721
Hannah?

31:31.306 --> 31:33.808
I have not seen you in such a long time.

31:33.892 --> 31:36.603
Girl, how have you been? That's so weird.
I didn't even see you.

31:37.437 --> 31:39.147
What are you wearing?

31:40.231 --> 31:41.232
It's so 90s.

31:42.483 --> 31:44.277
So...

31:44.527 --> 31:45.527
...chic.

31:46.946 --> 31:49.490
We're doing a piece at <i>Vogue,</i>
and you're just, like, killing it.

31:49.574 --> 31:51.654
It's about people who don't care
what they look like.

31:52.827 --> 31:56.039
Amazing. Amazing.
You're, like, nailing the exact aesthetic

31:56.122 --> 31:58.333
I've been trying to convey
to the photographer.

31:58.416 --> 32:01.096
Oh, my God, so funny running into you.
I was just about to text Nate

32:01.127 --> 32:02.927
about when you guys are going
to Neon Classic.

32:03.296 --> 32:05.381
I mean, I wasn't even gonna go,
but Kim was like,

32:05.465 --> 32:07.425
"Oh, you know, you never
fucking come out anymore,

32:07.467 --> 32:09.093
and Kanye wants to see you, so..."

32:10.011 --> 32:12.091
Oh, my God, shit!
That was supposed to be a surprise.

32:12.347 --> 32:14.182
I'm sorry, you were saying that Nate...

32:14.265 --> 32:15.308
Wait. Kanye's the...

32:15.391 --> 32:17.101
- Kanye's the secret headliner?
- Shh!

32:17.185 --> 32:18.019
That's insane!

32:18.102 --> 32:21.105
- And a problematic choice.
- Fix your hair so we can text Nate a pic.-

32:22.065 --> 32:25.276
We broke up, yesterday, uh, last night.
And, um, yeah.

32:26.569 --> 32:27.569
It's over.

32:30.865 --> 32:32.283
Oh!

32:33.993 --> 32:34.911
Oh, it's okay.

32:34.994 --> 32:36.621
No, it's gonna be okay.

32:37.246 --> 32:38.957
Everything's gonna be okay.

32:39.457 --> 32:40.457
Mm.

32:40.750 --> 32:42.210
That's really crunchy.

32:43.378 --> 32:45.171
It's like... Is that new denim?

32:45.254 --> 32:46.814
You know, if you need anything from me,

32:47.215 --> 32:49.550
just do not hesitate to contact
my assistant.

32:49.634 --> 32:50.510
Text is better.

32:50.593 --> 32:51.928
You'll get me faster.

32:52.011 --> 32:53.011
Thank you.

32:53.763 --> 32:56.557
Be well. It's so good to see you.

32:56.641 --> 32:58.081
- Okay, take care.
- Be well.

32:59.978 --> 33:01.813
Uh... J-Bug.

33:03.147 --> 33:05.441
She was saying something
about Nate and Neon Classic.

33:05.525 --> 33:06.901
You wanna, like, talk about that?

33:06.985 --> 33:09.237
Bam! Matt got us three wristbands.

33:09.320 --> 33:11.739
What you know about that?
And a tongue emoji. He sucks.

33:12.949 --> 33:13.989
And what Hannah said, I...

33:15.076 --> 33:16.756
I don't even know
what she's talking about.

33:16.828 --> 33:18.621
But who cares, right?
Who cares about Nate?

33:18.746 --> 33:21.499
The only thing that matters is us
living our best life, right?

33:21.582 --> 33:22.709
Living our best life.

33:22.792 --> 33:23.918
So, onto pressing matters,

33:24.002 --> 33:27.296
who wants to go to booty-hole Brooklyn
to get these wristbands?

33:27.380 --> 33:29.180
- I will rock-paper-scissors...
- I can do it.

33:32.385 --> 33:34.305
You're a really good friend.

33:35.179 --> 33:36.764
- And I love you, dude.
- I love you.

33:46.691 --> 33:47.692
Hey, Blair.

33:49.318 --> 33:50.653
I really do find it a bit tedious

33:50.737 --> 33:53.823
that you just couldn't put us on the list
for these wristbands.

33:54.198 --> 33:56.301
I hate to break it to you,
but there's no list.

33:56.325 --> 33:58.286
That's not true. There's always a list.

33:58.369 --> 33:59.569
So, you decided to come alone?

33:59.620 --> 34:01.664
Nobody else wanted to come
to this weird office.

34:02.373 --> 34:03.916
What do you even do here, Matt?

34:04.000 --> 34:05.209
Literally nothing.

34:10.547 --> 34:11.547
Hm.

34:12.300 --> 34:13.384
You look really good.

34:14.552 --> 34:15.552
No.

34:16.012 --> 34:16.888
Don't do that.

34:16.971 --> 34:19.971
Oh, come on, you wouldn't even be here
if you didn't want me to, you know...

34:20.641 --> 34:21.641
do that.

34:25.772 --> 34:27.482
Does Jenny know about us?

34:27.982 --> 34:29.275
There is nothing <i>to </i> know.

34:30.025 --> 34:31.025
Funny.

34:31.235 --> 34:33.321
Not how I remember it.

34:38.826 --> 34:41.411
I remember...

34:42.496 --> 34:43.915
a drunken night like...

34:45.291 --> 34:46.291
When was it?

34:47.627 --> 34:49.504
Two years ago? That I...

34:50.630 --> 34:53.549
...honestly have not
been able to stop thinking about since.

34:55.592 --> 34:57.845
You looked so incredible in those tights.

34:57.929 --> 35:00.389
They were so easy to rip off.

35:04.435 --> 35:05.435
Lock the door.

35:16.155 --> 35:17.073
This means nothing.

35:17.156 --> 35:18.156
Whatever you say.

35:24.914 --> 35:26.916
We shouldn't. We shou...

35:27.291 --> 35:29.293
I mean, if you really want me to stop,
I'll stop.

35:30.044 --> 35:31.420
Don't stop.

35:35.842 --> 35:37.552
Coming, my darlings!

35:38.177 --> 35:39.470
Coming!

35:41.389 --> 35:42.807
- Hi!
- Hi!

35:42.890 --> 35:44.225
- Come in.
- Woo-woo!

35:44.308 --> 35:45.184
Wassup!

35:45.268 --> 35:47.854
Ah! I just got out of the shower,
so don't mind me.

35:47.937 --> 35:50.815
- You smell delicious. It's been so long.
- Well, you never call me!

35:50.898 --> 35:53.109
I mean, what,
you don't do drugs anymore or what?

35:53.192 --> 35:55.112
We can't afford your shit.
You know that already.

35:55.153 --> 35:57.005
- Please.
- You got diamonds on your weed.

35:57.029 --> 35:59.031
Child, you know I love and miss you.

35:59.115 --> 36:00.741
You messy bitch!

36:01.409 --> 36:04.662
Now, don't tap, don't tap, baby.
That makes 'em real mad.

36:04.745 --> 36:07.874
Oh! Are these baby sharks?

36:07.957 --> 36:09.959
Yes, they're baby sharks!

36:10.084 --> 36:11.836
Yes, they're <i>so</i> tiny!

36:11.919 --> 36:13.337
I feel like they're my children.

36:13.421 --> 36:15.423
I got 'em illegally, so don't tell nobody.

36:15.506 --> 36:16.966
- Okay?
- Nobody to tell.

36:17.049 --> 36:20.511
Acting like anybody's gonna care
if they come up here with all your <i>drogas.</i>

36:20.595 --> 36:23.181
Come on, now. Baby sharks
is the least of your worries.

36:23.264 --> 36:25.725
Hey, <i>princesas!</i>

36:26.267 --> 36:27.560
- What?
- Uh-huh.

36:27.643 --> 36:28.683
They just do this for you.

36:28.728 --> 36:30.021
Yeah, they stay perched.

36:30.104 --> 36:32.207
- So you going to the big show tonight?
- You know it.

36:32.231 --> 36:33.941
Lotta people been through here today.

36:34.025 --> 36:35.276
I'm sure. Neon Classic!

36:35.359 --> 36:36.986
What's with this outfit?

36:37.069 --> 36:39.405
I mean, you look <i>crazy,</i>

36:39.739 --> 36:41.782
but at the same time, you look real sexy.

36:41.866 --> 36:44.202
- Ow!
- Yeah, you look good. I love it.

36:44.285 --> 36:45.494
Your girl is having a day.

36:45.578 --> 36:48.039
Can you just not? Can we not do that?
Not right now.

36:49.749 --> 36:52.001
- Nate broke up with her last night.
- No!

36:52.960 --> 36:53.961
Girl!

36:54.170 --> 36:55.254
Oh, my God, he's so hot.

36:55.922 --> 36:56.923
Aw, baby.

36:57.840 --> 36:59.985
Are you devastated?
Girl, 'cause I would be devastated.

37:00.009 --> 37:01.009
I'm okay.

37:02.136 --> 37:03.136
No, you're not.

37:03.346 --> 37:05.181
I can see the sadness in your eyes.

37:05.932 --> 37:06.932
You know what?

37:08.643 --> 37:10.243
- Shit!
- Oh, my goodness!

37:10.269 --> 37:12.605
- Jesus!
- I thought you pulled out another puppy.

37:12.688 --> 37:14.690
Oh, my goodness. Look at this.

37:14.774 --> 37:16.692
Ah! It's the holy grail of joints.

37:16.776 --> 37:18.576
How? How do you even roll something
like this?

37:18.653 --> 37:21.239
- Well, it takes a strong will.
- Mm.

37:21.322 --> 37:22.907
- And three papers, baby.
- Oh.

37:22.990 --> 37:25.284
Now, that's happy medicine
right there, girl.

37:25.368 --> 37:27.036
- Yes!
- Oh, Lord have mercy.

37:27.119 --> 37:28.119
Yes.

37:28.829 --> 37:31.374
Yeah, baby, this pimp shit easy.

37:32.458 --> 37:33.584
Just exhale.

37:35.211 --> 37:36.671
Let it all go away

37:36.754 --> 37:39.298
and think about happy times.

37:40.007 --> 37:41.367
<i>Oh, you wanna order Chinese?</i>

37:41.425 --> 37:42.927
That sounds like a good idea.

37:43.344 --> 37:44.344
You're smart.

37:44.387 --> 37:46.347
Oh! Why, thank you, baby.

37:46.430 --> 37:47.430
Let me see, let me see.

37:47.473 --> 37:49.600
Gimme all the food. All the food.

37:50.434 --> 37:52.103
Mixed vegetable with bean curd.

37:53.562 --> 37:54.647
What is bean curd?

37:55.022 --> 37:56.649
I just want to know.

37:56.732 --> 37:57.775
Like, I need to know

37:58.359 --> 37:59.485
what it is. Okay.

37:59.568 --> 38:01.028
<i>¿Que tu quiere, papa? Dime-lo.</i>

38:03.614 --> 38:05.616
Practice that Spanish of yours.

38:07.827 --> 38:08.827

38:13.040 --> 38:14.040
I love you.

38:19.588 --> 38:21.465

38:21.882 --> 38:22.882
That was stupid.

38:23.050 --> 38:24.810

- I shouldn't have said that, no.

38:24.885 --> 38:26.053
- I don't love you.
- What?

38:26.554 --> 38:28.848
I do... I do love you. I don't love...

38:29.974 --> 38:30.974
Ah, shit.

38:31.142 --> 38:32.893

38:39.692 --> 38:41.485

38:41.569 --> 38:42.945
No, that's cool. It's all right.

38:45.031 --> 38:46.741
It's okay. I mean... Yeah.

38:47.825 --> 38:49.910
Aw, I fucked it up, didn't I?

38:50.244 --> 38:52.121
No, baby, no, it's fine.

38:52.204 --> 38:53.706
Well, is it okay? Is that okay?

38:53.998 --> 38:56.435

38:56.459 --> 38:59.837
I'm just... I gotta... pee.

39:00.671 --> 39:02.311
And take a shower, 'cause I smell like...

39:03.299 --> 39:05.059
Kung Pao chicken.

39:05.217 --> 39:06.385
Chinese! Woo!

39:09.263 --> 39:10.263
It's fine, baby.

39:12.475 --> 39:13.642
It's fine. Hm.

39:15.811 --> 39:19.065
Why didn't I just say it!
Why didn't I just say it!

39:28.866 --> 39:29.866
Come here, girl.

39:30.659 --> 39:33.204
Oh, you wanna play kitty-cat, don't you?
I can play that.

39:34.455 --> 39:37.249

39:50.054 --> 39:52.056
Come here. I need to...
I need to find you.

You stupid ass.

39:54.558 --> 39:57.478
Get in the nose! Don't get in the nose.

40:01.816 --> 40:02.816
I love you.

40:03.109 --> 40:04.109

40:04.860 --> 40:05.694

I love you.

40:14.161 --> 40:16.330
I'll never put you in harm's way.

40:24.547 --> 40:25.756
Can I use your bathroom?

40:26.382 --> 40:27.299
Gimme the joint first.

40:27.383 --> 40:29.486
- Oh, you right.
- It's the door on the left down there.

40:29.510 --> 40:30.510
All right.

40:33.514 --> 40:34.723
So what you gonna do?

40:35.558 --> 40:39.562
Because I can feel so much love
in your eyes.

40:40.020 --> 40:41.939
Girl, this just can't be where it ends.

40:42.731 --> 40:43.899
Trust and believe.

40:45.317 --> 40:46.318
I'm also clairvoyant.

40:46.986 --> 40:47.986
Ain't that ghosts?

40:48.028 --> 40:49.947
It's everything.

40:50.114 --> 40:51.157
And I know,

40:51.240 --> 40:52.783
I know in my heart of hearts

40:53.742 --> 40:55.411
that you want your man back.

40:55.494 --> 40:57.538
So, girl, you gon' go get your man.

40:57.621 --> 40:59.915
Aight, homie, we gotta go
get these Neon Classic outfits.

40:59.999 --> 41:00.875
Okay.

41:00.958 --> 41:03.798
I would like three
of your finest Hype Mollys, please.

41:03.878 --> 41:04.878
How much?

41:05.671 --> 41:06.671
Forty.

41:08.215 --> 41:10.384
And one free for sad Jenny.

41:11.469 --> 41:12.511
- Yay.
- Hey.

41:12.595 --> 41:14.263
- Prizes for being sad.
- Hm.

41:14.555 --> 41:16.682
Oh, thank you, Hype.

41:17.141 --> 41:18.141
Thanks, Hype.

41:20.144 --> 41:21.144
Erin!

41:21.729 --> 41:22.980
I wanna go to Leah's store.

41:23.063 --> 41:25.149
- That was good.
- That was not good.

41:25.941 --> 41:28.277
I have a boyfriend, and my best friend
used to like you.

41:28.360 --> 41:29.403
Yeah, in college.

41:29.820 --> 41:33.073
Oh, come on, Blair. You can't possibly
be using the friend thing on me right now.

41:33.157 --> 41:34.157
Jenny hates me.

41:34.325 --> 41:36.994
Yeah, she hates you, which means
the feelings might still be there.

41:37.578 --> 41:38.579
Should I give her a call?

41:38.913 --> 41:39.747
Oh, my God.

41:39.830 --> 41:40.830
I'm kidding!

41:41.874 --> 41:46.837
Oh, my God, Blair, you seem like you
would be a total nightmare to date,

41:46.921 --> 41:50.591
but I'm head-over-heels
for your fucking crazy mind. Take these.

41:50.674 --> 41:53.111
- I have no idea how to respond to that.
- It was a compliment.

41:53.135 --> 41:54.655
- Don't think that was.
- Well, it was.

41:55.804 --> 41:57.097
Don't smile at me.

41:58.516 --> 41:59.516
You have a very...

42:00.434 --> 42:02.686
very nice smile and it makes me feel
fucking confused.

42:02.770 --> 42:04.688
- All right. See you later, Blair.
- Fuck you.

42:04.980 --> 42:06.357
Oh, uh, one more thing.

42:06.440 --> 42:07.983
Those wristbands are just GA.

42:08.067 --> 42:10.277
I couldn't really swing
anymore VIP, but...

42:10.736 --> 42:12.571
I put you guys on the list for the party.

42:17.159 --> 42:18.869
Are you fucking kidding me?

42:18.953 --> 42:19.828
I'm afraid not.

42:19.912 --> 42:22.706
That was not GA intercourse.

42:24.166 --> 42:25.501
You're the woman of my dreams.

42:27.962 --> 42:28.962
Bye, Blair.

42:30.589 --> 42:31.589
Oh, my God.

42:50.568 --> 42:51.968
Why are you spinning out right now?

42:52.027 --> 42:53.027
Me?

42:53.237 --> 42:54.363
I'm not. This is great.

42:54.446 --> 42:56.657
I'm happy to see her. It's fine, you know?

42:56.907 --> 42:59.243
Hey. I didn't think I'd see you today.

42:59.326 --> 43:03.372
Leah, 911, an emergency.
I just need my whole shit fixed.

43:03.789 --> 43:05.583
Breakup discount.
Thirty off the whole store.

43:05.666 --> 43:06.666
Go nuts.

43:07.501 --> 43:08.544
Oh, oh, oh!

43:08.752 --> 43:10.546
No sweatpants, bitch.

43:12.715 --> 43:14.383
I like that you're wearing my shirt.

43:15.301 --> 43:17.011
You know, it's a good shirt.

43:18.053 --> 43:20.806
You know, in keeping with my promise
from this morning,

43:21.432 --> 43:22.850
you still owe me an answer.

43:24.560 --> 43:26.937
I thought I would make it easy on you.
Brunch this Sunday.

43:27.396 --> 43:29.236
Jaclyn, Keelie, and Amanda
are already alerted.

43:29.315 --> 43:30.774
They're very excited to meet you.

43:31.025 --> 43:32.025
Oh...

43:32.484 --> 43:35.487
- Jaclyn, Keelie, <i>and</i> Amanda.
- Uh-huh.

43:35.571 --> 43:39.450
The trifecta. Squad... The squad goals.

43:39.825 --> 43:41.327
Um, uh...

43:41.410 --> 43:43.037
Sunday... Sunday, Sunday, Sunday.

43:43.120 --> 43:46.957
Sunday. What day is Sunday?
I gotta check my schedule.

43:47.041 --> 43:48.441
You know you don't have a schedule.

43:49.084 --> 43:50.084
Erin.

43:50.294 --> 43:52.296
- Can you help me in the dressing room?
- Yes.

43:52.755 --> 43:55.174
Yes I can, girl. Mm-hmm.

43:55.758 --> 43:56.758
I gotta go.

43:56.884 --> 43:59.303
- You gotta go?
- Help her in the dressing room.

43:59.386 --> 44:01.430
Okay, great. I bet you do.

44:05.184 --> 44:06.393
Jesus.

44:06.769 --> 44:08.449
What, are you gonna
try on the whole store?

44:08.646 --> 44:11.106
- Ow! Ow! The double?
- The double.

44:11.231 --> 44:12.231
You deserve that.

44:12.483 --> 44:13.643
What are you doing out there?

44:13.692 --> 44:15.152
Why are you being weird with Leah?

44:15.235 --> 44:17.655
I dunno. Sometimes a bitch
don't feel like brunchin'.

44:17.738 --> 44:18.656
Ooh.

44:18.739 --> 44:21.020
That is deadass the craziest shit
I've ever heard you say.

44:21.075 --> 44:22.159
You are a brunch queen.

44:22.493 --> 44:23.952
I call lies. Lies-ah Minnelli.

44:25.287 --> 44:26.538
It's none of your business.

44:27.331 --> 44:28.499
I was just trying to help.

44:28.707 --> 44:29.707
Don't.

44:33.128 --> 44:36.632
I love you and I know you're going through
it today, but there's nothing to fix here.

44:37.383 --> 44:38.383
All right?

44:52.731 --> 44:53.899
<i>That was embarrassing.</i>

44:54.358 --> 44:57.478
<i>You screaming at me in front of
an entire party was embarrassing for you?</i>

44:57.778 --> 44:59.498
I wasn't even looking at my phone
that much.

45:00.114 --> 45:03.826
Literally, every time I turned around
and looked up, you were looking down.

45:03.909 --> 45:05.589
Am I supposed to ignore my editor?

45:05.619 --> 45:08.723
I'm trying to get you to meet
the people I work with, and the whole time

45:08.747 --> 45:11.393
- you looking at your phone.
- Do you think I like being the shitty,

45:11.417 --> 45:12.626
fucking downer girlfriend?

45:12.710 --> 45:15.003
- Fuck it, let's go home.
- No, no, no, no, no.

45:15.087 --> 45:16.088
I don't want to go home.

45:16.171 --> 45:17.171
I want to go out.

45:17.548 --> 45:18.799
I'm fun, okay?

45:20.050 --> 45:22.250
Let's go back to the party.
I want to talk to everybody.

45:22.302 --> 45:24.388
I want to be exactly what you want, Nate.

45:24.596 --> 45:27.391
I could be 20-year-old Jenny again
with no responsibilities.

45:27.474 --> 45:29.226
Then maybe you'll still love me, huh?

45:29.643 --> 45:31.854
Don't fucking laugh at me! Fuck you!

45:31.937 --> 45:34.332
Since when do you give a shit about
the people you work with?

45:34.356 --> 45:36.710
You gonna get all close
to these new fucking worker friends?

45:36.734 --> 45:38.014
Don't change the subject.

45:38.068 --> 45:40.868
You tell me I don't love you when
you're the one moving across country.

45:40.904 --> 45:43.384
If you can't make that work,
what does that say about us?

45:43.490 --> 45:45.075
Wow, you turn it around on me.

45:45.159 --> 45:47.536
I did not turn this around on you!
You attacked me!

45:47.619 --> 45:49.913
- I attacked you?
- Yes, you fucking did.

45:50.414 --> 45:52.458
Why do you keep saying "fucking" to me?

45:52.541 --> 45:53.584
- Fuck!
- Fuck!

45:53.667 --> 45:54.877
- Fuck!
- Fuck!

45:54.960 --> 45:56.295
- Fuck!
- Fuck you, Nate!

45:58.547 --> 46:02.676
See, your insecurities are manifesting
themselves in a really ugly way right now.

46:03.886 --> 46:04.887
This isn't working.

46:04.970 --> 46:06.263
See, you need some sleep.

46:06.346 --> 46:08.950
- No, don't do that shit.
- That's what you need. I'm not doing shit.

46:08.974 --> 46:10.517
I am a grown-ass woman, all right?

46:11.310 --> 46:12.310
I don't need you.

46:14.730 --> 46:16.106
Yeah, you never do.

46:18.817 --> 46:19.943
You never fucking do.

46:50.307 --> 46:51.892
- I...
- I know.

47:19.461 --> 47:20.712
Oh, baby.

48:03.171 --> 48:04.811
- I want water. Do you want water?
- Yeah.

48:24.568 --> 48:25.611
Hey.

48:36.914 --> 48:39.666
- I love you so much.
- I love you, too.

48:51.178 --> 48:52.178
You're my person.

48:55.432 --> 48:56.432
Forever.

49:15.160 --> 49:16.160
Oh.

49:34.388 --> 49:35.388
Who farted?

49:35.639 --> 49:36.848
Oh, shoot! Baby, you okay?

49:37.182 --> 49:38.892
- I'm sorry. Oh, can I help?
- Shit!

49:38.976 --> 49:42.229
- Do you want me to get the stain-stick?
- Yes, get the stain-stick, Will, please.

49:44.523 --> 49:47.067
Oh, I'm so sorry. I was just goofing
around.

49:47.567 --> 49:48.567
Ooh.

49:48.652 --> 49:50.821
I'm sorry, I was just here cleaning up
a little bit

49:50.904 --> 49:52.364
'cause I know how busy you've been.

49:52.781 --> 49:53.782
You busy bee.

49:53.865 --> 49:55.659
You were in my room cleaning it?

49:55.742 --> 49:58.036
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
It was supposed to be a surprise.

50:02.457 --> 50:03.457
Will.

50:04.292 --> 50:05.127
Let's talk.

50:05.210 --> 50:06.210
- Okay.
- You can...

50:07.587 --> 50:08.587
It's good.

50:08.880 --> 50:10.966
Um...

50:11.675 --> 50:12.675
Take those off.

50:12.884 --> 50:13.884
You got it.

50:14.761 --> 50:15.887
You got it, dude.

50:20.183 --> 50:21.183
Are you happy?

50:22.185 --> 50:23.562
Yeah, of course I'm happy.

50:26.189 --> 50:28.442
'Cause I don't know if I'm happy anymore.

50:35.073 --> 50:36.158
Oh, my God!

50:37.617 --> 50:39.202
Wow, that is so good to hear.

50:40.787 --> 50:42.998
Oh! Thank God.

50:43.957 --> 50:46.126
I haven't been happy for <i>such</i> a long time.

50:46.460 --> 50:47.461
- Really?
- Yeah.

50:48.670 --> 50:50.255
Okay.

50:50.505 --> 50:51.673
Oh.

50:52.632 --> 50:55.427
Yeah. Honestly, I almost cheated on you
last week.

50:55.886 --> 50:56.720
Lint.

50:56.803 --> 50:57.637
With who?

50:57.763 --> 50:59.264
Uh, Brenda from work.

51:01.558 --> 51:02.558
Great!

51:03.268 --> 51:04.268
Well...

51:05.979 --> 51:07.314
I guess this is it, then.

51:07.773 --> 51:08.773
I guess.

51:12.194 --> 51:13.194
Hm.

51:14.863 --> 51:16.943
I don't know. We were just together
for so long, I...

51:17.324 --> 51:19.409
- thought this was gonna be a bigger deal.
- I know.

51:20.535 --> 51:22.954
But I do love you, Blair,
and I always will.

51:24.122 --> 51:25.122
I love you, too.

51:42.599 --> 51:45.185
And Will, please don't go back
in my bedroom and finish cleaning.

51:45.602 --> 51:46.645
Okay, good call.

51:56.113 --> 51:57.614
Jesus Christ.

51:59.366 --> 52:00.450
Hey.

52:03.787 --> 52:05.455
- Wake up, bitch!
- Where's my bra?

52:05.872 --> 52:06.872
Oh, shit.

52:07.124 --> 52:07.958
Fuck.

52:08.041 --> 52:11.586
I was just having the weirdest
fucking dream about Michael Cera.

52:11.670 --> 52:13.130
- Hmm.
- He is lean.

52:14.673 --> 52:16.424
I... I have news.

52:16.508 --> 52:18.343
- Mm-hmm?
- Um, all right.

52:19.469 --> 52:23.223
I don't want to make today about me, okay?
So just don't tell Jenny.

52:23.306 --> 52:25.433
Don't tell Jenny what? Ehhh!

52:25.892 --> 52:27.686
Hi. Morning.

52:27.769 --> 52:30.939
Hey, dude. Do you feel <i>horr-ib-le?</i>

52:33.150 --> 52:36.444
Oh, I wanna take, like, a million naps.
Go, tell me all your secrets!

52:36.528 --> 52:37.528
Spill the tea.

52:37.988 --> 52:40.198
I... broke up with Will.

52:40.699 --> 52:42.242
- I'm sorry, what?
- What?

52:42.325 --> 52:43.702
I did. I broke up with him.

52:44.286 --> 52:47.330
He was cleaning our apartment
when I got there.

52:47.831 --> 52:49.916
So, like, did you break up with him before

52:50.250 --> 52:52.043
or after he got to my room, though?

52:52.127 --> 52:53.127
Pause.

52:53.503 --> 52:54.903
What happened? How are you feeling?

52:54.963 --> 52:58.300
I mean, like, that kind of throws off
your whole married-before-30s steez.

52:58.383 --> 52:59.843
- You okay?
- I know.

52:59.926 --> 53:02.596
I know. I feel like I thought
I was going to be freaking out,

53:02.679 --> 53:05.724
and I am a little bit,
but I mostly feel...

53:06.099 --> 53:06.933
amazing.

53:07.017 --> 53:09.311
I do. And I'm so sorry to bring
this into the mix

53:09.394 --> 53:11.438
with everything that's happening
with you and Nate.

53:11.521 --> 53:14.816
- I don't wanna make this...
- No. They are completely different,

53:15.192 --> 53:17.485
- and I'm happy for you.
- Ah, yeah.

53:17.569 --> 53:20.739
You deserve better.
And he does too, no offense.

53:20.822 --> 53:23.366
- No, he does. He definitely does.
- Hey.

53:23.909 --> 53:24.826
What?

53:24.910 --> 53:27.954
Uh-uh.

53:28.955 --> 53:31.958
Bad Blair is not available.
She's not here right now.

53:32.042 --> 53:34.419
- Bad Blair came out a bit earlier today.
- What time is it?

53:34.502 --> 53:37.047
- You know what time it is.
- Get it, girl.

53:37.130 --> 53:39.424
- Oh, oh, oh!
- No. Bad Blair died at, like...

53:39.507 --> 53:40.550
Tequilas!

53:40.634 --> 53:43.154
- Bad Blair. Bad Blair.
- Can we make a mixed drink first?

53:43.178 --> 53:44.638
- Nah, bitch.
- Just to ease into it.

53:44.721 --> 53:47.307
- Open up.
- A little bit, just a tiny bit.

53:47.390 --> 53:48.892
- Gentle.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

53:48.975 --> 53:50.936
Gentle. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

53:51.019 --> 53:52.520
Yes!

53:52.604 --> 53:54.314
Oh, too much. Oh!

53:54.397 --> 53:55.565
She's back!

53:55.649 --> 53:57.776
Yes! Come on!

53:57.859 --> 53:59.903
Oh, shit, y'all. We need to get ready.

53:59.986 --> 54:03.615
I brought, like, 400 outfit choices.
Now that I am single, I need opinions.

54:03.698 --> 54:05.492
Oh, my God, holy shit.

54:06.243 --> 54:07.619
You guys, I am <i>single.</i>

54:07.702 --> 54:11.039
Wait, <i>putas,</i> I have something for you,
<i>perritas.</i>

54:15.043 --> 54:18.672
Is this our "Bitches and Bangers" playlist
from college?

54:18.755 --> 54:19.839
Yes, it is.

54:19.965 --> 54:22.217
Yas!

54:22.300 --> 54:24.970
Head feels like shit. Let's go!

54:27.597 --> 54:29.891
Oh, my God, I feel like you're gonna
give me a high five.

55:07.804 --> 55:08.972
Oh.

55:10.098 --> 55:12.517
You got it, girl! You got it!

55:44.674 --> 55:47.218
I am deeply obsessed with us right now.

55:52.098 --> 55:54.684
Yo. Ice cream is ice cream.
That shit is sugar.

55:55.018 --> 55:56.996
- Sugar's where it's at.
- Gimme that sugar, though.

55:57.020 --> 55:58.420
But I'm lactose-intolerant.

55:58.480 --> 56:01.024
- Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!
- Let's get that DC.

56:01.107 --> 56:03.044
- I got you, boo.
- How 'bout we drink some water?

56:03.068 --> 56:06.279
- We've been drinking a lot of alcohol.
- Oh, my God!

56:06.363 --> 56:09.407
I'm just looking out for us.
Do you guys like flavored water?

56:10.575 --> 56:12.856
- You could help me. You could do that.
- This is...

56:12.994 --> 56:15.121
Oh, no!

56:15.205 --> 56:16.331
Shit.

56:27.008 --> 56:28.688
They can't be playing this song right now.

56:29.386 --> 56:32.013
Oh, shit. You know what?
We don't need this bullshit.

56:32.097 --> 56:33.431
- Come on. Let's go.
- No, no, no.

56:34.015 --> 56:35.600
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

56:38.144 --> 56:40.688
You know what, Blair,
how about you get the snacks?

56:40.772 --> 56:42.732
- Yeah, totally.
- And we'll meet you outside.

56:42.816 --> 56:45.068
No.

56:48.279 --> 56:49.364
- It's okay.
- Yeah?

56:49.447 --> 56:50.447
Yeah.

56:51.199 --> 56:52.199
It's okay.

57:20.478 --> 57:23.273
Let's...

57:23.356 --> 57:25.275
get some snacks while she sings it out.

57:32.449 --> 57:33.449
You want string cheese?

57:38.246 --> 57:40.457
Am I there? Am I?

57:50.675 --> 57:51.675
Uh-uh.

57:55.805 --> 57:56.805
Blair.

57:59.684 --> 58:02.324
What the fuck are you doing?
Pay for the string cheese and get out!

58:02.770 --> 58:03.770
You're scaring my cat.

58:04.105 --> 58:05.648
You know what, fuck you!

58:05.940 --> 58:07.317
Fuck you, lady!

58:07.400 --> 58:08.818
This ain't no karaoke bar!

58:08.902 --> 58:10.742
Well, why'd you play the fucking music
so loud?

58:10.778 --> 58:13.114
Shh. Here's a twenty.
I'm so sorry to disturb you.

58:13.406 --> 58:14.824
Thank you. Have a lovely evening.

58:15.575 --> 58:17.911
You cannot anger your bodega man.
I did that one time,

58:17.994 --> 58:20.514
and now I have to walk three extra blocks
to go to the next one,

58:20.538 --> 58:22.578
- and it's a literal nightmare.
- Give me the Molly.

58:22.999 --> 58:25.835
Um, we're still <i>super</i> visible
right now, do you...

58:26.753 --> 58:27.753
Yeah, you right.

58:32.425 --> 58:33.425
I...

58:38.056 --> 58:39.182
- She seems...
- Yup.

01:00:04.517 --> 01:00:06.019
Who are all these people?

01:00:06.352 --> 01:00:08.229
I don't know. I figured
we'd know everyone.

01:00:08.396 --> 01:00:10.398
Everybody we know moved to L.A.

01:00:10.481 --> 01:00:12.984
- Fuck L.A.
- Says the girl moving to San Francisco.

01:00:13.067 --> 01:00:14.611
- Oh!
- Totally different.

01:00:14.694 --> 01:00:17.094
Should we try to slip into VIP
since Matt totally fucked you?

01:00:17.155 --> 01:00:18.615
What? He didn't fuck me.

01:00:19.449 --> 01:00:21.659
GA wristbands? Yeah, he did.

01:00:21.951 --> 01:00:23.786
Yeah, yeah, he fucked us
on the wristbands.

01:00:26.331 --> 01:00:27.165
What you doing?

01:00:27.248 --> 01:00:30.752
Hmm? What? Nothing.
I think I'm feeling this Molly, y'all.

01:00:31.002 --> 01:00:34.589
- Yes, ride that wave!
- Ay!

01:00:34.964 --> 01:00:37.050
How old do you think
that guy over there is?

01:00:38.926 --> 01:00:40.011
- That one?
- What?

01:00:40.094 --> 01:00:41.012
Girl.

01:00:41.095 --> 01:00:43.514
I think you bought these tickets
with bar mitzvah money.

01:00:43.598 --> 01:00:44.641
Fuck you.

01:00:44.724 --> 01:00:46.809
Fuck you, too, baby, come on!

01:00:46.893 --> 01:00:48.519
- Yes!
- Thank you, Erin!

01:00:48.603 --> 01:00:50.104
- Jessie Reyez is setting up.
- Oh!

01:00:50.188 --> 01:00:52.899
Excuse me, we know her.
Yes, we're best friends. We're cousins.

01:00:52.982 --> 01:00:53.982
Excuse me.

01:01:10.541 --> 01:01:12.043
Yes!

01:01:26.099 --> 01:01:27.225
I'm gonna go talk to him.

01:01:27.809 --> 01:01:30.311
I can't let you do that.
You'll thank me later.

01:01:31.813 --> 01:01:34.750
What do you mean, you can't let me do it?
I make my own decisions. Come on.

01:01:34.774 --> 01:01:35.942
I can't... Fuckin', no!

01:01:36.025 --> 01:01:38.444
Hey, come on.
Stop dancing in my way, Erin!

01:01:38.778 --> 01:01:41.280
Bitch, you ain't shit. I knew you were
coming here to see Nate.

01:01:41.364 --> 01:01:42.198
Bullshit!

01:01:42.281 --> 01:01:45.081
- What are you guys talking about?
- She came here tonight to see Nate!

01:01:45.576 --> 01:01:47.161
No, no, Jenny, no.

01:01:47.245 --> 01:01:49.247
- Please don't go.
- Oh!

01:01:49.330 --> 01:01:52.333
Blair, but I'm a grown-ass adult,
all right? I make my own decisions.

01:01:52.417 --> 01:01:55.169
- What the fuck? This bitch. Goddammit.
- Excuse me.

01:01:55.253 --> 01:01:56.293
Stop following me.

01:02:01.175 --> 01:02:02.552
We just want to help you.

01:02:02.635 --> 01:02:04.303
Just stop following me, then.

01:02:04.387 --> 01:02:07.408
- Stop forcing us to chase you.
- Oh, please, just go back to our spot.

01:02:07.432 --> 01:02:10.244
- I just need to go to the bathroom.
- I've known you long enough to know

01:02:10.268 --> 01:02:13.354
that you are definitely not just
going to the bathroom right now.

01:02:13.438 --> 01:02:15.273
- Oh?
- I love you <i>so</i> much.

01:02:15.481 --> 01:02:16.961
But this is getting fucking pathetic.

01:02:17.024 --> 01:02:18.192
He broke up with <i>you.</i>

01:02:18.276 --> 01:02:20.528
My heart
was ripped out of my chest, okay?

01:02:20.653 --> 01:02:23.948
But... it's not like I'd expect you
to know what that feels like.

01:02:24.031 --> 01:02:25.751
I can't get mad at you
for not understanding

01:02:25.783 --> 01:02:27.285
but I sure as hell can be mad at you

01:02:27.368 --> 01:02:29.370
for not being a friend to me
right now, Erin.

01:02:29.954 --> 01:02:30.954
You guys!

01:02:31.956 --> 01:02:32.956
We're good!

01:02:33.416 --> 01:02:35.042
- We're at Neon Classic!
- Uh...

01:02:35.460 --> 01:02:36.711
I feel great. You feel great?

01:02:36.794 --> 01:02:38.337
- Trying to.
- We feel great!

01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:40.673
You're pretty, you're pretty.

01:02:42.175 --> 01:02:43.175
We're having fun!

01:02:45.178 --> 01:02:47.180
This is our song! We love this song!

01:02:47.263 --> 01:02:48.473
- We do.
- We do.

01:02:48.556 --> 01:02:51.142
Why don't you go listen to it?
'Cause I don't need a babysitter.

01:02:51.476 --> 01:02:53.644
- You're kinda acting like a baby.
- Fuck you, Blair.

01:02:53.728 --> 01:02:55.688
Fuck you. I'm trying to stay neutral here.

01:02:57.523 --> 01:02:59.025
Thought you had to piss, princess.

01:03:01.402 --> 01:03:02.402
I do.

01:03:19.378 --> 01:03:21.047
Fuck. Fuck!

01:03:21.672 --> 01:03:23.382
Fuck me!

01:03:26.219 --> 01:03:28.221
Wait. Ugh.

01:03:29.138 --> 01:03:30.138
Nah.

01:03:50.034 --> 01:03:51.786
I don't want you to end us.

01:03:53.621 --> 01:03:55.122
Please don't end us.

01:03:55.748 --> 01:03:58.125
I know, baby. I don't want to end us.

01:03:59.001 --> 01:04:01.087
- I love you.
- I love you.

01:04:01.712 --> 01:04:04.048
I'm sorry about San Francisco.

01:04:05.216 --> 01:04:08.511
I can't turn down this opportunity,
but we can try long distance.

01:04:09.554 --> 01:04:11.097
You know it's not all about that.

01:04:12.056 --> 01:04:14.433
This isn't working anymore. You know that.

01:04:15.893 --> 01:04:17.854
I feel like we need to live our own lives.

01:04:18.646 --> 01:04:20.481
Ever since college, we're all we've known.

01:04:27.738 --> 01:04:29.615
But what if we were meant to be together?

01:04:33.953 --> 01:04:35.955
I mean, what if it's supposed to be us?

01:04:37.206 --> 01:04:38.291
No matter what happens,

01:04:38.374 --> 01:04:41.210
I feel like we're always gonna be
in each other's lives, so...

01:04:42.962 --> 01:04:45.339
It's fine. I mean, I... It will be okay.

01:04:51.262 --> 01:04:52.388
I'm scared, Nate.

01:04:54.348 --> 01:04:56.267
I'm scared to do this without you.

01:04:59.353 --> 01:05:00.353
Look at me.

01:05:12.700 --> 01:05:14.577
I love you.

01:05:24.795 --> 01:05:25.795
Okay.

01:05:33.179 --> 01:05:34.179
Can I...

01:05:35.973 --> 01:05:37.850
Can I just have a minute?

01:05:40.519 --> 01:05:41.519
Yeah.

01:05:45.816 --> 01:05:46.816
Fuck.

01:05:47.568 --> 01:05:48.569
Fuck.

01:07:59.408 --> 01:08:01.888
- You over the show already?
- You gotta be fucking kidding me.

01:08:05.581 --> 01:08:06.701
I just came to get some air.

01:08:07.917 --> 01:08:09.919
Okay. Air's that way.

01:08:11.295 --> 01:08:12.655
You know, you can't smoke in here.

01:08:13.130 --> 01:08:15.883
Oh, my God. What are you, security?
I'm by the door.

01:08:25.643 --> 01:08:27.883
Look, I got a car coming to pick me up
in about a minute.

01:08:28.062 --> 01:08:30.481
Take me to the House of Yes.
Why don't you come with me?

01:08:31.064 --> 01:08:33.317
I don't need a rebound, Matt.

01:08:34.318 --> 01:08:36.403
I'm not offering sex.

01:08:36.487 --> 01:08:39.532
I'm... I'm literally just offering you
a ride to the after-party.

01:08:41.367 --> 01:08:44.745
My phone isn't working,
and Erin and Blair are still inside, so...

01:08:44.870 --> 01:08:46.205
No, that's cool, I'll text them.

01:08:46.622 --> 01:08:47.622
Let's go.

01:09:56.150 --> 01:09:57.860
<i>It's Jenny. Leave a message.</i>

01:09:57.943 --> 01:10:01.322
Jenny, I know your fucking phone is dead,
and you need to find a charge,

01:10:01.572 --> 01:10:04.132
and you better call us back.
You're being such a <i>fucking</i> asshole.

01:10:04.158 --> 01:10:07.036
We just really want to be there for you,
so we just need you to call us.

01:10:07.119 --> 01:10:09.121
We love you. We love you so much.

01:10:10.080 --> 01:10:12.750
- What the fuck was that?
- She's not gonna respond to that.

01:10:12.833 --> 01:10:14.793
- You can't yell at her.
- I don't care.

01:10:16.170 --> 01:10:17.213
She needs to grow up.

01:10:19.465 --> 01:10:20.466
What... What was that?

01:10:21.300 --> 01:10:24.887
I mean, it's kind of the pot
telling the kettle to grow up,

01:10:25.221 --> 01:10:27.264
but... I don't know, never mind.

01:10:28.515 --> 01:10:30.935
Yeah, okay. I am not the pot.

01:10:31.936 --> 01:10:33.062
- Oh, really?
- Mm.

01:10:34.313 --> 01:10:36.065
You're late to work <i>every</i> day.

01:10:36.649 --> 01:10:37.691
Not every day.

01:10:37.942 --> 01:10:40.486
You go out on work days
more than you go out on weekends.

01:10:40.569 --> 01:10:42.112
Because it's bridge and tunnel.

01:10:42.279 --> 01:10:44.907
Erin, you're holding onto something
that is gone.

01:10:44.990 --> 01:10:46.670
Do you think you're gonna be
young forever?

01:10:46.700 --> 01:10:48.911
We're almost 30 years old.
It's not cute anymore.

01:10:48.994 --> 01:10:51.705
Don't you have personal goals?
Do you have a plan for the future?

01:10:51.789 --> 01:10:53.791
How did your plan work out?
Oh, right.

01:10:53.874 --> 01:10:56.502
It was completely fucking insane
and backfired.

01:10:56.585 --> 01:10:57.670
It did not <i>backfire.</i>

01:10:57.753 --> 01:10:59.213
We can't fuck around anymore.

01:10:59.296 --> 01:11:03.175
I want a best friend that gets up with me
on Saturdays to go to the farmers' market.

01:11:03.259 --> 01:11:05.719
And you sleep through the farmers' market
every weekend.

01:11:05.803 --> 01:11:09.181
Is that what being an adult means to you?
Going to the fucking farmers' market.

01:11:09.265 --> 01:11:12.559
- What else? Tell me your ways.
- Admitting that you like Leah,

01:11:12.893 --> 01:11:14.895
and you want to be in a relationship
with her.

01:11:16.438 --> 01:11:17.731
What are you so afraid of?

01:11:17.815 --> 01:11:19.358
Everything!

01:11:21.819 --> 01:11:24.029
If I grow up, it means I need to change

01:11:24.780 --> 01:11:26.156
<i>everything.</i>

01:11:26.991 --> 01:11:29.285
Everything's already
fucking changing, Blair.

01:11:29.368 --> 01:11:30.577
Jenny's leaving.

01:11:33.080 --> 01:11:35.916
And actually, the farmers' market
sounds really, really like...

01:11:36.375 --> 01:11:39.003
assuring and coddling
and comforting right now.

01:11:39.086 --> 01:11:40.754
Like, is there one tomorrow?

01:11:41.380 --> 01:11:43.215
- Great fresh produce.
- Yeah.

01:11:43.507 --> 01:11:47.261
All I feel right now is, like, just love
for you coursing through my veins,

01:11:47.344 --> 01:11:48.721
and I just want to hug it out.

01:11:48.804 --> 01:11:50.180
Me too. I just want to hug you.

01:11:50.264 --> 01:11:51.932
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.

01:11:52.016 --> 01:11:53.309
I'm so sorry.

01:11:54.268 --> 01:11:55.268
I love you.

01:11:56.478 --> 01:11:59.189
- Say it back!
- I love you.

01:12:00.899 --> 01:12:01.899
Oh, shit.

01:12:03.986 --> 01:12:04.987
She's with Matt.

01:12:05.070 --> 01:12:06.238
- Oh.
- I have an address.

01:12:07.865 --> 01:12:09.158
- Hoo!
- Yeah.

01:12:09.241 --> 01:12:10.617
We're back.

01:12:10.701 --> 01:12:11.701
All right.

01:12:12.828 --> 01:12:13.871
I gotta make a pit stop.

01:12:13.954 --> 01:12:14.954
Okay.

01:12:15.497 --> 01:12:16.999
Woo!

01:12:33.057 --> 01:12:34.350
Oh, shit dicks.

01:12:35.434 --> 01:12:38.395
Shit. Here, here, here. Let me help you.
Let me get...

01:12:38.479 --> 01:12:40.397
Nope, no, no. No, no.

01:12:40.481 --> 01:12:42.483
Big girl, grownup here.

01:12:42.566 --> 01:12:43.566
I'm sorry!

01:12:43.776 --> 01:12:45.056
You know this is all your fault.

01:12:45.861 --> 01:12:47.029
Oh, yeah? Enlighten me.

01:12:47.112 --> 01:12:49.990
Well, if you had just dated me in college,
I would never have met Nate.

01:12:50.074 --> 01:12:51.714
And I wouldn't be completely heartbroken.

01:12:51.742 --> 01:12:53.243
I was dumb in college.

01:12:53.327 --> 01:12:55.746
You know I fucked several different women
that stole from me?

01:12:56.288 --> 01:12:59.166
Oh, wow!
I was so obsessed with you in college.

01:12:59.249 --> 01:13:03.170
I spent so much time thinking about you
and crying over you and...

01:13:04.797 --> 01:13:07.633
It just makes me realize that
what I felt for you wasn't even real

01:13:07.716 --> 01:13:10.594
because it definitely didn't feel
like this.

01:13:11.387 --> 01:13:13.263
Come on.
You're looking at it all wrong.

01:13:13.555 --> 01:13:16.058
You've been <i>blessed</i> with a broken heart.

01:13:16.308 --> 01:13:18.727
When it doesn't hurt anymore,
that's when it's really over.

01:13:18.811 --> 01:13:20.521
Live in this as long as you can.

01:13:24.233 --> 01:13:25.233
I gotta go.

01:13:26.193 --> 01:13:27.027
Really?

01:13:27.194 --> 01:13:30.114
Tell Erin and Blair
that I am going to finish it.

01:13:30.197 --> 01:13:32.509
- And they'll know what I mean.
- What are you talking about?

01:13:32.533 --> 01:13:33.533
That makes no sense.

01:13:33.742 --> 01:13:35.494
Oh, right. You're... You're on drugs.

01:13:35.577 --> 01:13:37.538
I... forgot, you're on drugs.

01:13:37.996 --> 01:13:39.248
Are you cool? You okay?

01:13:39.331 --> 01:13:40.999
- I'm gonna be okay.
- All right.

01:13:41.125 --> 01:13:42.251
Hey, Young!

01:13:42.835 --> 01:13:45.295
I'm sorry I was such an asshole
in college.

01:13:46.463 --> 01:13:47.463
Don't be.

01:13:48.048 --> 01:13:49.133
You helped me find Nate.

01:13:52.553 --> 01:13:53.554
Hi.

01:13:53.637 --> 01:13:56.014
- Hi!
- Hey! Hi!

01:13:56.390 --> 01:13:57.975
- Leah!
- What's up?

01:13:58.058 --> 01:13:59.560
- Hi!
- You okay?

01:13:59.768 --> 01:14:01.270
- Yeah.
- Shit, you're rich.

01:14:01.395 --> 01:14:04.440
Everything's great. I just need to,
like, talk to you <i>right</i> now.

01:14:04.523 --> 01:14:06.567
She wants to go to the farmers' market
with you.

01:14:07.109 --> 01:14:08.444
Right now?

01:14:09.069 --> 01:14:11.405
No, like...
Like, normal farmers' market...

01:14:11.488 --> 01:14:12.656
- Functioning hours.
- Yeah.

01:14:13.532 --> 01:14:14.950
- It's real.
- Mm-hmm.

01:14:15.117 --> 01:14:16.743
- You're so pretty.
- Don't touch her.

01:14:16.827 --> 01:14:18.537
- Thank you.
- Oh, my God, her skin.

01:14:19.788 --> 01:14:20.622
Okay, boo.

01:14:20.706 --> 01:14:21.706
Yeah.

01:14:22.166 --> 01:14:23.417
How you feeling? You still...

01:14:24.001 --> 01:14:25.544
- Yeah. Oh, my God.
- Yeah.

01:14:25.627 --> 01:14:28.130
- I feel like it's gotten more intense.
- I can see that.

01:14:28.213 --> 01:14:29.213
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:14:29.798 --> 01:14:33.302
So I'm going to play you some
really great music.

01:14:33.385 --> 01:14:37.014
Okay? You just let it, like,
wash over you, all right?

01:14:37.097 --> 01:14:40.809
Just let it, like, move you
wherever you want to go, okay?

01:14:40.893 --> 01:14:44.646
And whatever you do, do <i>not</i> take
the headphones out until I tell you to.

01:14:46.773 --> 01:14:48.150
Great.

01:14:48.233 --> 01:14:50.569
I can feel
the seasons changing!

01:14:50.903 --> 01:14:51.903
Yeah.

01:14:53.030 --> 01:14:54.030
Perfect.

01:14:55.491 --> 01:14:56.617
You got it, girl.

01:14:57.868 --> 01:15:00.078
Woo! All right. Let's have a...

01:15:00.662 --> 01:15:01.662
Yeah...

01:15:01.872 --> 01:15:03.582
Seat... Sit... Seat...

01:15:05.751 --> 01:15:08.212
- Are you rolling?
- I am, I am definitely rolling.

01:15:08.295 --> 01:15:11.048
But that has nothing to do with the words
that are about to come out

01:15:11.381 --> 01:15:12.216
of my face right now.

01:15:12.341 --> 01:15:14.718
- Understood.
- Yeah, great. Okay. Mm.

01:15:20.224 --> 01:15:22.434
Alright, give me a minute.

01:15:24.311 --> 01:15:25.311
I...

01:15:26.104 --> 01:15:28.065
think I lo...

01:15:28.273 --> 01:15:29.733
Hmm. Why is this so hard?

01:15:30.734 --> 01:15:32.174
Because you've never said it before.

01:15:33.987 --> 01:15:34.987
Is that bad?

01:15:35.113 --> 01:15:36.113
No.

01:15:37.616 --> 01:15:39.176
When I was in college, I thought I'd...

01:15:42.204 --> 01:15:43.204
You get it.

01:15:44.498 --> 01:15:45.832
With this, uh, one girl,

01:15:46.416 --> 01:15:47.626
and she was great.

01:15:48.293 --> 01:15:52.214
You know, everything was great.
It was fun. She was smart. Whatever.

01:15:52.756 --> 01:15:56.260
And our relationship was... beautiful.

01:15:57.261 --> 01:15:59.513
And, out of nowhere, she just like...

01:16:01.682 --> 01:16:02.683
went back to men.

01:16:04.309 --> 01:16:05.936
And it fucking crushed me.

01:16:07.771 --> 01:16:08.771
I felt like...

01:16:09.565 --> 01:16:11.066
I was just some experiment.

01:16:13.694 --> 01:16:15.821
And I've never told anyone that.

01:16:17.531 --> 01:16:19.908
- Not Jenny, who's my fucking bestie.
- Mm.

01:16:20.909 --> 01:16:23.203
Or that crazy bitch back there.

01:16:25.747 --> 01:16:26.999
I know what that feels like.

01:16:28.709 --> 01:16:29.835
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

01:16:32.254 --> 01:16:34.798
See, I've never had someone
to share this part of myself with.

01:16:37.092 --> 01:16:38.092
Woo!

01:16:38.135 --> 01:16:39.928
I'm feeling, like, so many things
right now,

01:16:40.012 --> 01:16:41.763
like, so many things.

01:16:42.639 --> 01:16:45.392
Yeah. You have two straight best friends.

01:16:46.351 --> 01:16:49.354
I have to imagine you're not sitting
around reading queer theory together.

01:16:53.483 --> 01:16:55.235
You know, I'm good with taking it slow.

01:17:00.157 --> 01:17:02.075
- You sure?
- Mm-hmm.

01:17:02.159 --> 01:17:05.537
I am terrified of meeting your friends.
Like, what if they don't like me?

01:17:05.621 --> 01:17:06.747
Bitch, everybody likes you.

01:17:07.581 --> 01:17:08.415
Yeah, you right.

01:17:08.498 --> 01:17:11.043
- Oh, wow. Okay, okay.
- You right.

01:17:15.213 --> 01:17:16.813
- I think I...
- I think I love you, too.

01:17:26.224 --> 01:17:28.435
<i>Do you think I can have
one more kiss?</i>

01:17:28.977 --> 01:17:31.521
<i>I'll find closure on your lips,
and then I'll go.</i>

01:17:32.105 --> 01:17:36.401
<i>Maybe also one more breakfast,
one more lunch, and one more dinner.</i>

01:17:37.027 --> 01:17:39.071
<i>I'll be full and happy</i>

01:17:39.154 --> 01:17:40.989
<i>and we can part.</i>

01:17:42.199 --> 01:17:45.661
<i>But in between meals,
maybe we can lie in bed one more time.</i>

01:17:46.370 --> 01:17:50.165
<i>One more prolonged moment
where time suspends indefinitely</i>

01:17:50.415 --> 01:17:52.417
<i>as I rest my head on your chest.</i>

01:17:53.752 --> 01:17:58.840
<i>My hope is if we add up the "one mores,"
they will equal a lifetime,</i>

01:17:59.216 --> 01:18:02.177
<i>and I'll never have to get to the part
where I let you go.</i>

01:18:02.427 --> 01:18:04.680
Yes, baby! Baby, wait.

01:18:04.763 --> 01:18:06.515
Grip on. Grip on tight.

01:18:06.598 --> 01:18:08.558
- We're okay. Go, go, go, go.
- No. Fuck this.

01:18:08.642 --> 01:18:10.352
Actually, you owe my ass a...

01:18:11.395 --> 01:18:12.729
Okay, fine. Let's do it.

01:18:12.979 --> 01:18:14.064
Oh! Shit!

01:18:14.147 --> 01:18:15.565
You're a dick!

01:18:15.649 --> 01:18:17.442
<i>But that's not real, is it?</i>

01:18:18.485 --> 01:18:20.237
<i>There are no more "one mores."</i>

01:18:21.405 --> 01:18:23.657
<i>I met you when everything
was new and exciting,</i>

01:18:23.740 --> 01:18:26.785
<i>and the possibilities
of the world seemed endless.</i>

01:18:27.619 --> 01:18:28.619
<i>And they still are.</i>

01:18:29.287 --> 01:18:30.997
<i>For you, for me.</i>

01:18:32.249 --> 01:18:33.249
<i>But not for us.</i>

01:18:34.167 --> 01:18:37.212
<i>Somewhere between then and now,
here and there,</i>

01:18:37.462 --> 01:18:39.464
<i>I guess we didn't just grow apart,</i>

01:18:39.715 --> 01:18:40.715
<i>we grew up.</i>

01:18:42.926 --> 01:18:46.763
<i>When something breaks, if the pieces
are large enough, you can fix it.</i>

01:18:47.931 --> 01:18:51.476
<i>Unfortunately, sometimes things
don't break, they shatter.</i>

01:18:52.853 --> 01:18:54.271
<i>But when you let the light in,</i>

01:18:54.896 --> 01:18:56.440
<i>shattered glass will glitter.</i>

01:18:57.524 --> 01:18:58.734
<i>And in those moments,</i>

01:18:59.276 --> 01:19:01.153
<i>when the pieces of what we were
catch the sun,</i>

01:19:02.320 --> 01:19:04.448
<i>I'll remember just how beautiful it was.</i>

01:19:05.657 --> 01:19:07.701
<i>Just how beautiful it'll always be.</i>

01:19:07.909 --> 01:19:09.161
<i>Because it was </i> us.

01:19:10.120 --> 01:19:11.288
<i>And we were magic.</i>

01:19:12.372 --> 01:19:13.832
- <i>Forever.</i>
- Forever!

01:19:43.195 --> 01:19:44.404
All right, divide and conquer.

01:19:44.488 --> 01:19:46.740
- I'll take this room, you take that one.
- Yup-yup!

01:19:48.658 --> 01:19:49.658
Blair!

01:19:55.248 --> 01:19:57.000
God, you're so fucking sexy.

01:19:58.418 --> 01:19:59.418
Oh, she cute.

01:19:59.878 --> 01:20:00.878
All right.

01:20:05.759 --> 01:20:08.261
Where the fuck <i>is</i> this bitch?

01:20:17.687 --> 01:20:20.065
Holy fuck!

01:20:20.816 --> 01:20:22.734
Wow, uh... Wow.

01:20:22.818 --> 01:20:23.818
Uh, Blair Bear?

01:20:24.778 --> 01:20:28.740
Girl, I just want you to know that I am
just as proud of you right now as I am

01:20:28.824 --> 01:20:30.617
deeply disturbed by what I just saw.

01:20:30.909 --> 01:20:32.244
But I stand by you!

01:20:32.702 --> 01:20:35.372
And your risque choices,
and I will meet you outside.

01:20:35.664 --> 01:20:37.249
Don't forget to wash your hands.

01:20:39.668 --> 01:20:40.668
You fuck, boo.

01:20:41.670 --> 01:20:42.670
You fuck.

01:20:45.340 --> 01:20:48.385
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

01:20:50.971 --> 01:20:52.722
Can you please get out of me now?

01:20:52.806 --> 01:20:54.683
Yeah, sorry. I just sorta froze up.

01:20:59.521 --> 01:21:00.522
Ahem.

01:21:02.107 --> 01:21:02.941
Hello.

01:21:03.108 --> 01:21:05.110
Oh, hey, what's up?

01:21:05.485 --> 01:21:06.570
- Hi.
- Feeling relaxed?

01:21:06.653 --> 01:21:07.487
Shut up.

01:21:07.571 --> 01:21:09.531
Anything you care to share with the class?

01:21:11.491 --> 01:21:12.909
It was only the second time.

01:21:13.368 --> 01:21:14.369
Oh, my God.

01:21:14.786 --> 01:21:15.786
Today.

01:21:16.663 --> 01:21:19.541
- You did it at his office?
- I needed to get the wristbands.

01:21:19.666 --> 01:21:21.126
We needed to get the wristbands.

01:21:21.459 --> 01:21:23.545
I don't even fucking know who you are
right now.

01:21:24.504 --> 01:21:25.504
Like in a bad way?

01:21:25.881 --> 01:21:27.674
In the best way.

01:21:28.383 --> 01:21:29.383
You out here.

01:21:29.759 --> 01:21:31.136
Living your best life,

01:21:31.428 --> 01:21:32.929
just making choices.

01:21:33.013 --> 01:21:34.222
- Yes.
- Taking risks.

01:21:34.306 --> 01:21:35.682
- Yes.
- Yes.

01:21:35.765 --> 01:21:36.765
Feels good.

01:21:37.100 --> 01:21:38.100
It should.

01:21:39.477 --> 01:21:41.077
Do you think Jenny's gonna be mad at me?

01:21:41.104 --> 01:21:43.189
No. Why would she be mad at you?
She loves you.

01:21:43.398 --> 01:21:44.398
Yeah.

01:21:45.400 --> 01:21:46.985
Did we ever find out where she went?

01:21:47.444 --> 01:21:48.444
No.

01:21:48.987 --> 01:21:49.987
Tiny Ethan...

01:21:50.530 --> 01:21:52.574
said she said something
to Matt about, like...

01:21:53.408 --> 01:21:56.786
going out and finishing it,
and then she, like, stalked off.

01:21:56.870 --> 01:21:59.080
- So ominous.
- Bitch is dramatic, we know this.

01:21:59.164 --> 01:22:01.249
- "Finish it"?
- Yup. I have no idea.

01:22:01.833 --> 01:22:03.153
It has to do something with Nate.

01:22:03.209 --> 01:22:05.086
Where would she go to finish
the relationship?

01:22:07.255 --> 01:22:09.095
Oh, my God, yep.
Know where she's at. Let's go.

01:22:09.883 --> 01:22:10.883
Oh, God.

01:22:11.509 --> 01:22:12.509
God.

01:22:33.573 --> 01:22:35.742
Knew I'd find <i>you</i> here.

01:22:40.789 --> 01:22:41.957
I fucked up, Jen.

01:22:42.290 --> 01:22:44.209
Like, I really fucked up.

01:22:45.418 --> 01:22:47.379
All right, we... have to try.

01:22:48.338 --> 01:22:49.338
Like, I'll move,

01:22:49.381 --> 01:22:51.883
or we'll go back and forth or what...

01:22:51.967 --> 01:22:53.802
I don't know, but I know that we...

01:22:53.885 --> 01:22:56.054
I can't just do this without you.

01:22:56.554 --> 01:22:58.474
I know I said
we got to be our own people, but...

01:22:59.349 --> 01:23:01.184
Shit, I'm not even a person without you.

01:23:03.436 --> 01:23:06.481
Maybe this whole thing implodes,
nothing works,

01:23:07.440 --> 01:23:08.441
but at least we try.

01:23:12.487 --> 01:23:14.656
- Hey.
- Jenny! Jenny baby!

01:23:15.281 --> 01:23:16.825
Your ass is all the way out.

01:23:16.908 --> 01:23:19.369
- Hey.
- Jen. Jenny.

01:23:19.869 --> 01:23:21.454
- Hey.
- What?

01:23:21.538 --> 01:23:24.290
Oh, my God.
We were so fucking worried, dude.

01:23:25.250 --> 01:23:27.877
Oh, my God. I'm so stupid.

01:23:27.961 --> 01:23:30.801
Yeah, Washington Square Park?
Like, how the fuck did you not get robbed?

01:23:32.132 --> 01:23:33.132
You okay?

01:23:33.633 --> 01:23:34.633
I'm sad.

01:23:36.261 --> 01:23:37.595
I'm just so sad.

01:23:39.222 --> 01:23:42.017
Oh, but it's like the good sad, you know?

01:23:42.517 --> 01:23:43.517
I, uh...

01:23:45.103 --> 01:23:46.271
We loved each other.

01:23:47.897 --> 01:23:49.065
We love... We...

01:23:49.983 --> 01:23:52.663
We love each other. I mean,
'cause that shit doesn't go away, right?

01:23:52.736 --> 01:23:54.195
- No.
- It's, uh...

01:23:56.906 --> 01:23:58.283
Wasn't just San Francisco.

01:24:00.702 --> 01:24:02.245
We were all sorts of fucked up.

01:24:04.497 --> 01:24:05.497
I think about...

01:24:06.332 --> 01:24:08.835
us and him and New York City and...

01:24:10.795 --> 01:24:12.898
how I thought if I could just
keep everything the same

01:24:12.922 --> 01:24:14.758
then nothing would change, but...

01:24:17.010 --> 01:24:18.470
Everything's changing.

01:24:20.013 --> 01:24:21.413
Did you get to talk to him?

01:24:21.765 --> 01:24:24.184
No, I couldn't. I mean, I couldn't...

01:24:25.060 --> 01:24:28.104
I saw him, but I don't know, I...

01:24:30.857 --> 01:24:32.192
I guess, um...

01:24:32.650 --> 01:24:35.528
Shit, I guess in that moment,
I was choosing myself.

01:24:37.030 --> 01:24:38.531
'Cause it's like, it's not, um...

01:24:39.657 --> 01:24:40.700
our journey anymore.

01:24:41.868 --> 01:24:42.868
It's mine.

01:24:44.204 --> 01:24:45.204
Fuck.

01:24:46.164 --> 01:24:49.292
Oh, fuck, that's so weird.
That's so fucking weird.

01:24:49.375 --> 01:24:51.169
- But kind of amazing, right?
- Yeah.

01:24:57.425 --> 01:25:00.637
I am so scared to be without you two.

01:25:01.596 --> 01:25:03.348
I don't know life without this.

01:25:06.684 --> 01:25:08.103
We're scared too, okay?

01:25:09.062 --> 01:25:10.730
But this isn't gonna change.

01:25:11.523 --> 01:25:12.982
We'll still be doing this.

01:25:13.274 --> 01:25:15.151
Living in different cities
won't change that.

01:25:15.527 --> 01:25:16.903
Aight? We'll still be FaceTiming

01:25:17.320 --> 01:25:19.364
- every morning.
- Right when I hit that pooper.

01:25:19.447 --> 01:25:21.449
While you're on the motherfucking toilet.

01:25:21.991 --> 01:25:23.511
- No.
- Why don't you ever join in that?

01:25:23.535 --> 01:25:25.703
- I'm not gonna do that.
- It's a phenomenal activity.

01:25:25.787 --> 01:25:27.413
I don't wanna see either of you shit.

01:25:29.207 --> 01:25:31.584
I'm sorry. I love you both, but no.

01:25:31.668 --> 01:25:33.044
I'm just like this.

01:25:34.462 --> 01:25:37.215
I'm really glad you guys pulled me out
of work today.

01:25:37.507 --> 01:25:39.342
- You are?
- Today was amazing.

01:25:39.425 --> 01:25:40.260
It was epic.

01:25:40.343 --> 01:25:41.343
An update.

01:25:41.886 --> 01:25:44.264
I caught this bitch, on the sink,

01:25:44.639 --> 01:25:46.432
having sex... with Matt.

01:25:46.516 --> 01:25:47.516
Girl!

01:25:47.809 --> 01:25:49.602
Girl?

01:25:49.686 --> 01:25:50.687
At the after-party.

01:25:50.770 --> 01:25:53.690
But I also might have slept with him
when I went to get the wristbands.

01:25:56.276 --> 01:25:57.276
I'm sorry.

01:25:57.443 --> 01:25:59.195
- Was it good?
- Yes.

01:25:59.279 --> 01:26:03.283
Yes, it was so good, and that's the best...
worst part. Are you mad?

01:26:03.408 --> 01:26:04.408
Are you kidding?

01:26:06.703 --> 01:26:07.703
Thrusting, thrusting.

01:26:07.745 --> 01:26:09.247
You guys are coochie-cousins!

01:26:11.666 --> 01:26:13.426
- I'm kinda jealous.
- You should be.

01:26:13.459 --> 01:26:15.461
Oh! Also, update.

01:26:16.296 --> 01:26:19.132
Before we went to the after-party,
we stopped by Leah's place.

01:26:19.215 --> 01:26:20.383
Y'all did so much.

01:26:20.466 --> 01:26:21.861
- It was a lot of time.
- And Erin...

01:26:21.885 --> 01:26:23.887
basically <i>Say Anything'd </i> her.

01:26:24.971 --> 01:26:26.347
- Boombox?
- No boombox.

01:26:26.431 --> 01:26:27.431
But...

01:26:27.849 --> 01:26:29.142
we did say "I love you."

01:26:34.314 --> 01:26:37.025
- Oh, that's my boo.
- Yes.

01:26:37.400 --> 01:26:38.460
- You did that?
- You guys...

01:26:38.484 --> 01:26:39.903
I'm so proud of us.

01:26:40.904 --> 01:26:42.447
Oh, so much.

01:26:42.530 --> 01:26:44.449
- Yeah.
- Ah. So good.

01:26:44.532 --> 01:26:46.701
- So grown.
- Yeah, real grown.

01:26:46.784 --> 01:26:49.996
There was a point, many points...
tonight was long...

01:26:50.079 --> 01:26:52.582
where I was like, "All I want to do
is go to Leah's

01:26:52.665 --> 01:26:54.500
and watch that murder doc on Netflix."

01:26:54.584 --> 01:26:57.212
Okay, so you have to go online afterwards
and get the articles,

01:26:57.295 --> 01:26:59.565
because there's so much
they don't tell you in the series.

01:26:59.589 --> 01:27:02.717
- Yeah, you said that before.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's the real deal.

01:27:03.092 --> 01:27:06.137
Okay. That girl is 12. We need to go.

01:27:06.221 --> 01:27:08.598
- She's a baby.
- It's too much. We did it.

01:27:08.681 --> 01:27:10.534
- Yep, it's done.
- You're good.

01:27:10.558 --> 01:27:13.645
We done did it. We done did it, y'all.

01:27:13.728 --> 01:27:14.938
We did.

01:27:15.021 --> 01:27:16.105
Hold up.

01:27:17.232 --> 01:27:18.441
- Oh.
- Oh, shit.

01:27:18.524 --> 01:27:20.568
- Yep, can somebody take me home?
- Mm-hmm.

01:27:21.277 --> 01:27:23.279
Yay!

01:27:23.363 --> 01:27:25.448
- Oh, my God.
- All better!

01:27:27.367 --> 01:27:29.202
- Oh. I'm hungry.
- Again?

01:27:29.285 --> 01:27:32.372
Where did this
rain come from, though?

01:27:32.455 --> 01:27:36.042
- It's super aggressive, it's strange.
- Kinda like our night.

01:27:36.125 --> 01:27:38.127
I feel like I gotta stop.

01:27:38.211 --> 01:27:39.879
I gotta just keep facing outwards.

01:27:39.963 --> 01:27:42.757
- I think I got gum in my purse.
- Can we get tacos?

01:27:42.840 --> 01:27:44.676
Yeah!
