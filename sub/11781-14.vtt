WEBVTT

00:05.906 --> 00:07.508
That's me. Jane Quimby.

00:07.541 --> 00:09.077
My life is a little
complicated right now.

00:09.110 --> 00:11.112
I landed
my fashion dream job
working for her,

00:11.145 --> 00:12.480
Gray Chandler Murray.

00:12.513 --> 00:14.548
The only problem,
they think I'm an adult.

00:14.582 --> 00:16.517
Now I am juggling
two secret lives,

00:16.550 --> 00:19.087
one in high school
and one in high fashion.

00:19.120 --> 00:20.621
ALL: Surprise!

00:21.855 --> 00:24.558
I guess not everyone
forgot about your birthday.

00:24.592 --> 00:26.594
Had a lot of fun
hanging out with you.

00:26.627 --> 00:28.062
I think you're great.

00:28.096 --> 00:29.130
I wanna do it again.

00:31.099 --> 00:33.534
It wasn't India.
It was me.

00:33.567 --> 00:35.069
I gave our
secrets to Beau.

00:36.104 --> 00:37.105
Wait a minute.
Is that...

00:37.138 --> 00:38.139
Amanda Clark.

00:38.172 --> 00:39.473
Ben!

00:39.507 --> 00:41.475
She was our prom queen.

00:41.509 --> 00:43.811
BILLY: This is Zoe.
That's Jane.

00:43.844 --> 00:45.146
I feel like
we've pretty much met.

00:47.515 --> 00:48.616
Mom?

00:48.649 --> 00:49.650
Happy birthday, Jane.

00:52.653 --> 00:55.623
I can't believe
you let her spend
the night here.

00:55.656 --> 00:57.825
Seriously,
why would you do that?

00:57.858 --> 00:59.627
Well, for starters,
she's our mother.

00:59.660 --> 01:02.830
Only in the very
loosest definition
of the word.

01:02.863 --> 01:06.500
So, I heard
you two chatting
in your room last night.

01:06.534 --> 01:07.835
What'd she say?
Where's she been?

01:07.868 --> 01:10.104
Well, I tried to talk
to her about that and...

01:10.138 --> 01:11.572
And?

01:11.605 --> 01:13.141
And she reminded me
it was a school night

01:13.174 --> 01:14.508
and I should probably
get to bed.

01:14.542 --> 01:16.110
How long is she staying?

01:16.144 --> 01:17.645
She was a little
vague about that.

01:17.678 --> 01:19.547
Did she say
why she's back?

01:20.181 --> 01:22.516
She also avoided that.

01:22.550 --> 01:25.653
Great! So you got nothing!
Well done, Nancy Drew.

01:25.686 --> 01:26.854
Where are you going?

01:26.887 --> 01:27.821
To get some answers.

01:27.855 --> 01:30.658
Look, I want to know
what's going on, too.

01:30.691 --> 01:33.661
But she just got here,
and I don't wanna
scare her off.

01:33.694 --> 01:35.529
Oh, I'm fine with that.

01:35.563 --> 01:38.566
Well, I'm not.
I just want to
get to know her, Ben.

01:39.667 --> 01:40.868
Jane...

01:40.901 --> 01:42.903
I mean it!

01:42.936 --> 01:46.607
The whole drama
with Jeremy at work has
got me so stressed out, I...

01:46.640 --> 01:48.542
Just do me a favor
and try and be nice.

01:48.576 --> 01:50.611
Please, please,
try and be nice
to her. Okay?

01:50.644 --> 01:54.148
And don't drive her away.

01:54.182 --> 01:56.550
(SIGHS) It's too late.
Look what you did, Ben.

01:56.584 --> 01:57.485
Me?

01:57.518 --> 02:00.154
Yeah, you! Are you happy?
She's gone now.

02:00.188 --> 02:02.223
Frankly, that's longer
than I thought she'd stay.

02:02.256 --> 02:03.691
Hey, sleepy heads.

02:03.724 --> 02:05.726
Couldn't find
the mixing bowl.
Somebody moved it.

02:06.694 --> 02:08.596
Yeah, eight years ago.

02:10.664 --> 02:12.233
So, what're you
doing, Mom?

02:12.266 --> 02:14.168
Making breakfast.

02:14.202 --> 02:17.238
When you two were little
I couldn't make flapjacks
fast enough.

02:17.271 --> 02:18.572
Any takers?

02:18.606 --> 02:20.641
Me! I would love some.

02:20.674 --> 02:23.211
How about you, Ben?
I'll put chocolate chips
in them.

02:23.244 --> 02:24.678
I'll pass.

02:24.712 --> 02:27.715
Oh, Mom this is cute.
Is this your espresso pot?

02:27.748 --> 02:29.717
I got it when
I lived in Italy.

02:29.750 --> 02:31.619
Italy! That sounds exciting.

02:31.652 --> 02:34.588
Oh, it was.
For a while.

02:34.622 --> 02:36.257
I worked at a winery.

02:36.290 --> 02:41.229
Um, there was this guy.
But things got complicated.

02:41.262 --> 02:42.730
Really? So what happened?

02:43.697 --> 02:45.733
Later.

02:45.766 --> 02:49.603
Right now I need to
get you two fed
and off to school.

02:49.637 --> 02:51.305
Any idea where
I might find a spatula?

02:55.643 --> 02:56.477
Here.

02:56.510 --> 02:58.746
We moved the utensils
back in 2008,

02:58.779 --> 03:01.315
you were probably
stomping grapes
in Tuscany.

03:04.718 --> 03:07.255
He's not really
a morning person.

03:17.331 --> 03:21.302
* I've my heart where
my head should be

03:21.335 --> 03:24.638
* Light up the rest of me

03:24.672 --> 03:28.242
* 'Cause your dreams,
they won't fall apart

03:28.276 --> 03:30.244
* Through the stops,
the starts

03:30.278 --> 03:33.213
* And life is a work of art

03:35.048 --> 03:37.818
* Stepping from the path

03:38.752 --> 03:40.721
* A love affair

03:40.754 --> 03:43.257
* A love affair

03:43.291 --> 03:46.794
* Tripping there and back

03:46.827 --> 03:48.996
* I need you though

03:49.029 --> 03:51.665
* I need you less

03:51.699 --> 03:55.035
* Sitting near the window

03:55.068 --> 03:57.271
* I see it all

03:57.305 --> 03:59.707
* I see it all

03:59.740 --> 04:03.277
* Calling from the shadows

04:03.311 --> 04:07.815
* I can not fall
I can not

04:07.848 --> 04:12.052
* Trip on, trip on
the light, the light's
in you

04:12.085 --> 04:14.322
* Switch on
Switch on...

04:14.355 --> 04:17.024
ThanNo problem.ride.

04:17.057 --> 04:19.827
So... I waSo?hinking...

04:19.860 --> 04:21.329
What are you doing
after school?

04:22.062 --> 04:23.797
What did you have in mind?

04:23.831 --> 04:26.800
I don't know.
How does hanging out sound?

04:26.834 --> 04:28.802
Get something to eat,
maybe see a movie.

04:28.836 --> 04:30.371
A date? With you?

04:30.404 --> 04:32.373
No! No, no, no.

04:32.406 --> 04:33.707
With this other guy
that I know that I think
you might like.

04:33.741 --> 04:35.343
Oh, yeah? Is he cute?

04:35.376 --> 04:37.044
Well, it depends
on your type.

04:37.077 --> 04:39.813
I kinda like a guy
with his own style,

04:39.847 --> 04:41.849
smart, a little punky.

04:41.882 --> 04:44.284
I'm a sucker
for green eyes, too.

04:46.887 --> 04:49.056
Is that your mom?

04:49.089 --> 04:51.825
We should get going.
We don't want to be
late for school, right?

04:54.127 --> 04:55.329
Okay.

04:57.365 --> 05:00.834
* Looking close at danger

05:00.868 --> 05:05.373
* I've seen it all
I've seen it all

05:05.406 --> 05:09.877
* Looking close
at strangers... *

05:09.910 --> 05:12.079
Good morning.

05:12.112 --> 05:13.847
(GASPS)
Good morning, Jenkins!

05:13.881 --> 05:14.882
Have you heard the news?

05:14.915 --> 05:15.949
News?

05:15.983 --> 05:19.887
Whitemarsh High
has finally scored
its very own

05:20.921 --> 05:22.390
drama teacher.

05:22.423 --> 05:24.758
The lovely,
the talented

05:24.792 --> 05:26.427
Amanda Clark.

05:37.438 --> 05:39.106
(INAUDIBLE)

05:39.139 --> 05:41.375
You've gotta be
kidding me.

05:46.179 --> 05:47.381
Hey.

05:48.148 --> 05:49.383
You okay?

05:49.417 --> 05:51.351
Actually... I'm not.

05:52.453 --> 05:53.854
You're never gonna
guess who's back.

05:53.887 --> 05:55.389
Ugh, I know.

05:55.423 --> 05:56.790
How do you know?

05:56.824 --> 05:59.159
How could I miss her.
How long do you think
she'll stick around?

05:59.192 --> 06:00.428
I thought she'd be
gone by now.

06:00.461 --> 06:02.129
Me, too.

06:02.162 --> 06:04.131
To be honest,
I thought you'd be
happy she was back.

06:04.164 --> 06:07.401
No way. I can't believe
I was ever
inside that woman...

06:07.435 --> 06:08.736
What?

06:08.769 --> 06:10.938
I'm saying,
I can't believe she
carried me for nine months.

06:10.971 --> 06:12.873
Wait. Who are you
talking about?

06:15.976 --> 06:18.812
And then there was
that time at the ashram.

06:18.846 --> 06:21.181
Oh, all that meditating
was such a drag.

06:21.214 --> 06:23.917
Oh, and I also worked
as a roadie for Whitesnake.

06:23.951 --> 06:24.952
Who?

06:24.985 --> 06:26.887
Hair band. From the '80s.

06:26.920 --> 06:28.422
And they're still touring?

06:28.456 --> 06:31.158
Well, it was a cover band.
But they were awesome.

06:31.191 --> 06:33.961
And so all this
was just last year?

06:33.994 --> 06:36.430
Oh, give or take
a few months.

06:36.464 --> 06:39.433
The school looks the same.

06:39.467 --> 06:41.969
Oh, that bench,
right there,

06:42.002 --> 06:44.472
that's where
your father and I
had our first kiss.

06:44.505 --> 06:46.173
Aw, your first kiss?

06:46.206 --> 06:48.442
Well, it wasn't
my first kiss.

06:48.476 --> 06:51.479
I was pretty popular
in high school.

06:51.512 --> 06:54.482
What can I say?
The boobs came in early
and I stayed out late.

06:54.515 --> 06:55.983
(CHUCKLES)

06:56.016 --> 06:59.487
Speaking of boys,
anyone special
in your life?

06:59.520 --> 07:03.857
Uh, well, I guess
there is this one guy.

07:03.891 --> 07:07.861
His name is Eli.
And he's cute.

07:07.895 --> 07:10.531
Yummy cute
or baby-face cute?

07:10.564 --> 07:13.200
DefinitMmm-hmm.y cute.

07:13.233 --> 07:17.871
But the thing is,
we've only been out on
a sort of fake date so far.

07:17.905 --> 07:19.306
Fake date?

07:19.339 --> 07:21.975
Well, it's a long story.
He was supposed to
ask me out on a real date,

07:22.009 --> 07:24.211
he hasn't asked me yet
and now I don't know
if I should...

07:24.244 --> 07:27.247
Ask him.
It's 2012, kiddo!

07:27.280 --> 07:28.482
ReMmm.?

07:29.917 --> 07:33.020
This is nice.
Talking to you
about boys and stuff.

07:33.053 --> 07:36.023
Sometimes it's really hard
to talk to Ben
about these things.

07:38.559 --> 07:40.227
I can't tell you
how many times I wished

07:40.260 --> 07:41.562
you were here for me
to talk to.

07:43.030 --> 07:44.064
Mmm-hmm.

07:45.065 --> 07:47.501
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to...

07:49.036 --> 07:52.506
Billy Nutter?
Is that you?

07:52.540 --> 07:54.274
It is, isn't it?

07:54.307 --> 07:57.945
Oh, I'd recognize
that face anywhere.

07:57.978 --> 08:01.048
So handsome.
Such a good face.

08:01.081 --> 08:02.916
Oh, I'm so glad to see you
turned out well.

08:02.950 --> 08:04.518
I was worried
you might end up
in prison or something.

08:04.552 --> 08:07.254
Come to dinner tonight.

08:07.287 --> 08:09.557
You'll come, right?
I'll see you
at dinner, okay?

08:15.563 --> 08:17.931
Whoa! Was that...

08:17.965 --> 08:19.366
Yes. It was.

08:19.399 --> 08:21.969
When exactly were you
planning on telling me
that your mom came back?

08:22.002 --> 08:24.004
It just happened
last night.

08:24.037 --> 08:25.539
Did she say
why she came back?

08:25.573 --> 08:26.574
Nope.

08:26.607 --> 08:28.942
Did she sayNo.y she left?

08:28.976 --> 08:30.944
Did you ask her anything?

08:30.978 --> 08:32.546
Ugh! What, did you
and Ben get together
and compare notes?

08:32.580 --> 08:34.081
Give it a rest!

08:34.114 --> 08:37.551
And besides,
you've been
busy lately,

08:37.585 --> 08:40.287
using my car, driving
other people around.

08:40.320 --> 08:41.689
I'm glad she did come.

08:41.722 --> 08:44.091
Otherwise,
I would still be hobbling
to school in my high heels.

08:45.125 --> 08:48.128
Okay. Somebody's touchy today.

08:52.666 --> 08:55.736
(BELL RINGING)

08:55.769 --> 08:58.672
Man, first Jeremy
drops that bomb on you

08:58.706 --> 09:00.774
and now your mom just
appears out of nowhere.

09:00.808 --> 09:03.844
No wonder you've been
such a raging...

09:03.877 --> 09:05.846
Pretty, pretty girl.

09:05.879 --> 09:06.680
What am I gonna do
about work?

09:06.714 --> 09:08.782
I have no idea
how to handle this!

09:08.816 --> 09:11.819
Yeah. I'd be more concerned
about running into India.

09:11.852 --> 09:13.887
Aren't you the one
who got her sacked?

09:13.921 --> 09:17.825
Yes, but in my defense,
she looked
really, really guilty.

09:17.858 --> 09:19.693
But she really,
really wasn't.

09:19.727 --> 09:22.896
(SIGHS) You're missing
the point here.
Jeremy bad. Me good.

09:22.930 --> 09:25.799
(SIGHS) What am I doing?
I'm a teenager! This is crazy

09:25.833 --> 09:27.735
I shouldn't be dealing
with corporate espionage,

09:27.768 --> 09:29.670
I should be choosing
my filter on Instagram.

09:29.703 --> 09:30.904
(LAUGHS)

09:30.938 --> 09:33.741
Heads up, people.
Pop quiz in World History.

09:33.774 --> 09:36.777
Or studying for that!
I didn't even study for that!

09:36.810 --> 09:37.911
Thank you
for the warning.

09:37.945 --> 09:40.648
And also,
that is a great jacket.

09:40.681 --> 09:42.816
Thanks. You know that
thrift store on Park Street?

09:42.850 --> 09:44.718
(CHUCKLES) Know it?

09:44.752 --> 09:46.820
The amount of times
I've watched this girl
try on dresses there.

09:46.854 --> 09:48.822
I have a tiny
vintage obsession.

09:48.856 --> 09:50.490
Me too!

09:50.523 --> 09:53.794
I make it my mission in life
not to spend more than
like ten dollars on anything.

09:54.962 --> 09:58.766
Whoa! Except for that,
of course. It's gorgeous.

09:58.799 --> 10:01.702
Oh, this?
It's just a knock-off.

10:03.871 --> 10:06.707
Anyway, I gotta
get to class.
I'll see you guys.

10:09.743 --> 10:10.778
Hmm.

10:10.811 --> 10:12.913
"Hmm." What?

10:12.946 --> 10:16.850
I'd love to have
that bracelet, but
it's like 1000 dollars.

10:16.884 --> 10:18.786
She just said
it was a knock-off.

10:18.819 --> 10:20.921
Uh, no, that was
very much real.
I know my Hermes.

10:20.954 --> 10:22.890
Gray has one that
I've been coveting
for months.

10:22.923 --> 10:25.893
No way. Zoe has,
like, zero money.

10:25.926 --> 10:27.928
You should see
where she lives.

10:27.961 --> 10:30.698
How would she get
1000 dollars
for a bracelet?

10:30.731 --> 10:32.733
I don't know,
but it's definitely not
from the thrift store.

10:35.903 --> 10:36.904
What are you implying?

10:36.937 --> 10:37.938
I'm not implying anything.

10:37.971 --> 10:39.707
What, like she stole it?

10:39.740 --> 10:42.009
(SCOFFS) Billy, relax.
I like Zoe.

10:42.042 --> 10:43.944
All I'm saying is
the bracelet's real.

10:43.977 --> 10:46.013
Wherever she got it from
is none of my business.

10:54.788 --> 10:55.823
What was that about?

10:56.990 --> 10:59.026
I'm going to need
a little more to go on.

10:59.059 --> 11:02.896
This morning? Mom?
You said you were
gonna try and be nice.

11:02.930 --> 11:04.798
I tried. I failed.
I've come to terms with it.

11:04.832 --> 11:05.833
Stop trying
to make her leave.

11:05.866 --> 11:09.737
Her leaving is inevitable.
But what about you?

11:09.770 --> 11:11.972
You're treating this
like she just got back
from the grocery store.

11:12.005 --> 11:13.774
I am not!

11:13.807 --> 11:14.908
This is Kate Quimby
we're talking about.

11:14.942 --> 11:16.877
She's completely
unpredictable.

11:17.978 --> 11:20.013
You don't remember
what she's like, Jane.

11:20.047 --> 11:24.818
My point exactly.
I want to
get to know her, Ben.

11:24.852 --> 11:27.087
And I know it was
killing you not to eat
those pancakes. So there!

11:28.021 --> 11:29.056
Not fair!

11:31.959 --> 11:33.026
(PAPER RUSTLING)

11:37.965 --> 11:38.966
What the...

11:50.978 --> 11:54.882
It's a cool idea, huh?
A modernization of
Cinderella.

11:54.915 --> 11:57.885
I workshopped it in LA.
It had a lot of heat
out there.

11:57.918 --> 12:00.854
But instead you brought it
to Whitemarsh High School.

12:00.888 --> 12:01.889
How generous.

12:01.922 --> 12:04.057
I know.

12:04.091 --> 12:08.028
Ooh, there he is.
I've been looking
for Ben all day!

12:08.061 --> 12:09.897
Mmm-mmm-mmm.

12:09.930 --> 12:11.064
I'm gonna tear that up.

12:15.969 --> 12:17.871
Hey. HoHey.e you?

12:19.973 --> 12:22.075
I'm gonna tear this up!

12:30.050 --> 12:31.885
What are you
still working on?

12:31.919 --> 12:33.821
The Harrods presentation
is tonight.
Why aren't you done?

12:33.854 --> 12:36.023
Good morning
to you, too, India.

12:36.056 --> 12:37.090
We're only presenting
three things

12:37.124 --> 12:38.859
from the capsule
collection tonight.

12:38.892 --> 12:40.828
You've apMmm.ed two...

12:40.861 --> 12:42.996
I'm just putting
the final touches
on the third.

12:43.030 --> 12:44.932
So where is it?

12:44.965 --> 12:46.934
I'm having a little trouble
concentrating lately.

12:46.967 --> 12:48.001
What with all the blackmail!

12:48.035 --> 12:49.536
Well, maybe you should've
thought of that earlier.

12:49.569 --> 12:53.073
And what were you thinking
with that little outburst
of yours last night?

12:53.106 --> 12:56.844
I'm not gonna let you
ruin my plans with some
half-cocked confession.

12:56.877 --> 13:02.049
About that, I may or may not
have confessed it all
to Jane last night.

13:02.082 --> 13:03.116
Well, which is it?

13:04.117 --> 13:05.118
I think I did.

13:05.152 --> 13:05.953
Why would you do that?

13:05.986 --> 13:08.956
You locked me
in a closet, India!

13:08.989 --> 13:12.059
I was under
a lot of pressure,
I'd had a bit to drink,

13:12.092 --> 13:13.927
and then,
Jane found me...

13:13.961 --> 13:16.129
You make this right, Jeremy.
Or I will take you down.

13:23.203 --> 13:25.005
Oh. Hey.

13:27.007 --> 13:28.976
It's pretty wild
being back here, right?

13:29.009 --> 13:31.011
It can be a little
strange sometimes.

13:31.044 --> 13:33.113
I know, I keep expecting
to see people that
we went to school with.

13:33.146 --> 13:35.949
Yeah. That'll wear off.

13:35.983 --> 13:38.151
Well, listen.
I didn't plan this,

13:38.185 --> 13:41.188
but word got out
that I'm back,

13:41.221 --> 13:46.059
and some of the old gang
is getting together tonight
at The Rack. You in?

13:46.093 --> 13:49.029
I don't know.
I kind of have a lot
going on right now.

13:49.062 --> 13:51.064
Oh, come on.
Everyone's going.

13:51.098 --> 13:53.200
It's gonna be like
a little reunion, you know.

13:53.233 --> 13:55.903
Courtney.
Kelly Spazderski.

13:55.936 --> 13:57.170
(LAUGHS)
Spaz! How is she?

13:57.204 --> 13:59.006
Still spazzy.

13:59.039 --> 14:01.074
I even heard that
Thin Johnny
will be there.

14:01.108 --> 14:04.044
So, come on,
you know you want to.

14:15.122 --> 14:18.025
Will you excuse me,
for a minute, Amanda?

14:18.058 --> 14:20.060
I've got to take care
of something.

14:29.970 --> 14:31.238
What are you doing here?

14:31.271 --> 14:34.007
I thought the three of us
could have lunch.
Where's Jane?

14:35.042 --> 14:36.176
Hey, Mrs. Quimby.

14:36.209 --> 14:38.078
Oh, Billy, please,
call me Kate.

14:38.111 --> 14:41.181
Mrs. Quimby sounds like
somebody's mother.

14:41.214 --> 14:43.984
And we wouldn't want
anyone to get that
impression, would we?

14:46.019 --> 14:50.190
Okay, Kate.
I have work to do.
Have a good day.

14:50.223 --> 14:51.258
What about lunch?

14:51.291 --> 14:54.061
Great idea.
Except I ate already,

14:54.094 --> 14:56.196
and Jane leaves
early every day
for her internship.

14:56.229 --> 14:58.165
Which you would know
if you'd been around.

14:58.198 --> 15:00.267
Wait, Jane leaves this early?
Is that a good idea?

15:00.300 --> 15:02.135
She's probably
missing so much...

15:02.169 --> 15:05.973
Are you honestly
giving me parenting
advice right now?

15:06.006 --> 15:07.140
I've managed pretty well
since you left.

15:07.174 --> 15:10.077
Speaking of which,
when will you be?
Leaving? Again?

15:10.110 --> 15:14.081
Okay. You obviously
have some hostility
towards me.

15:14.114 --> 15:16.083
Obviously. Now,
answer the question.

15:16.116 --> 15:17.317
How long?

15:17.350 --> 15:21.989
I don't know.
I'd like to stay as
long as I'm welcome.

15:22.022 --> 15:23.256
I just want to
spend time with you.

15:25.258 --> 15:27.260
What happened?
With that guy?

15:27.294 --> 15:30.030
The complicated
relationship?

15:31.298 --> 15:35.135
It was nothing. It ended.
It's no big deal.

15:35.168 --> 15:38.105
Let me guess.
You ended it, right?

15:38.138 --> 15:40.173
'Cause that's
sort of your M.O.

15:40.207 --> 15:44.277
Things get complicated
and you run?

15:44.311 --> 15:48.281
You need to go
before Jane realizes
this is just a pit stop.

15:48.315 --> 15:52.285
Don't you at least think
Jane deserves a chance
to know me?

15:57.124 --> 16:01.061
You have until
the end of the week.
And then I want you gone.

16:03.230 --> 16:07.200
Well, don't forget!
Family dinner tonight!
Lasagna!

16:07.234 --> 16:11.171
Thanks, but no thanks.
I've got plans
and Jane works late.

16:21.314 --> 16:23.183
JEREMY: Jane!

16:23.216 --> 16:25.185
Sorry. I didn't
mean to scare you.
Can we talk?

16:26.286 --> 16:28.055
I'm kinda busy...

16:28.088 --> 16:30.157
It's just I woke up
this morning with
a terrible hangover

16:30.190 --> 16:32.325
and a vague recollection
of telling you something.

16:32.359 --> 16:34.127
How could you?

16:34.161 --> 16:34.961
So, I did tell you?

16:34.994 --> 16:38.298
I looked up to you.
I admired you.

16:38.331 --> 16:41.068
Don't... Don't look
at me that way.

16:41.101 --> 16:43.303
How else am I supposed
to look at you?

16:43.336 --> 16:46.173
Why would you
do that to us? To Gray?

16:46.206 --> 16:47.074
You don't understand.

16:47.107 --> 16:49.309
And India!
You stood there and watched

16:49.342 --> 16:52.212
as I got her fired
for something that you did.

16:52.245 --> 16:53.146
I made a mistake.

16:53.180 --> 16:56.183
A mistake? A mistake is
dropping a stitch,

16:56.216 --> 16:58.251
it's not selling out
your entire company.

16:58.285 --> 17:00.120
You're right.
But if you would
just let me explain...

17:00.153 --> 17:03.256
No, don't! It's not me
you need to explain to.
It's Gray.

17:03.290 --> 17:06.259
Jane, I don't think
you're handling this
like an adult!

17:06.293 --> 17:08.328
Not everything is
so black and white.

17:08.361 --> 17:11.098
Tell her!

17:11.131 --> 17:14.167
I have a lot of work to do
before the reveal of the
Harrods sneak peek tonight.

17:14.201 --> 17:17.237
I don't care.
You tell Gray.
Or I will.

17:25.445 --> 17:26.613
Jane, have you seen Jeremy?

17:26.646 --> 17:28.481
Unfortunately.

17:28.515 --> 17:30.350
What's that
supposed to mean?

17:30.383 --> 17:32.452
Nothing.
I haven't seen him
since this morning.

17:32.485 --> 17:34.521
Did you call him?

17:34.554 --> 17:36.323
Of course I called him.
He's not picking up.

17:36.356 --> 17:37.590
And Gray's asking
to see those samples now.

17:37.624 --> 17:39.492
Maybe he just took
an early lunch.

17:39.526 --> 17:41.328
He took all the designs
with him.

17:41.361 --> 17:42.495
To lunch?

17:42.529 --> 17:43.596
I don't think he's at lunch.

17:44.631 --> 17:45.632
The designs are gone?

17:45.665 --> 17:47.434
All of them.
The entire line.

17:47.467 --> 17:50.337
Oh, yes.

17:50.370 --> 17:51.371
(WHISPERS)
This is not good.

17:51.404 --> 17:52.505
(WHISPERS)
This is a disaster.

17:52.539 --> 17:54.541
But the Harrods people
are going to be here tonight.

17:54.574 --> 17:56.376
And we have
nothing to present.

17:56.409 --> 17:57.477
Unless we can find Jeremy.

18:08.488 --> 18:09.589
(DOG BARKING)

18:13.626 --> 18:15.562
Good afternoon, Miss.

18:15.595 --> 18:17.397
Jeremy Jones
lives here, right?

18:17.430 --> 18:19.566
I can't disclose
that information.

18:19.599 --> 18:21.401
You can't? Why not?

18:21.434 --> 18:22.602
It's the rules.

18:22.635 --> 18:24.404
Doorman rules?

18:24.437 --> 18:26.373
Door person.

18:26.406 --> 18:27.407
(SIGHS)

18:28.575 --> 18:33.480
Jeffrey! Oh.
You're the Jeffrey.

18:33.513 --> 18:36.416
You're not at all
what I pictured from
Jeremy's description of you.

18:36.449 --> 18:37.517
What did he say
about me?

18:37.550 --> 18:38.585
Ha! You just
confirmed he lives here!

18:38.618 --> 18:41.421
Now, please let me in,
so that I can talk to him.

18:41.454 --> 18:44.591
He left two hours ago.
I put him in a cab to JFK.

18:44.624 --> 18:46.526
No, no, no.

18:49.429 --> 18:52.465
Go, go, boys!
Pick it up! Pick it up!

18:55.468 --> 18:56.903
Hey, Coach.

18:56.936 --> 18:59.439
You're late.
You better get out there.
What's that thing on your arm?

18:59.472 --> 19:00.540
It's a sling.

19:00.573 --> 19:03.643
I know it's a sling.
Please tell me
it's a joke.

19:03.676 --> 19:07.414
Yeah, I wish.
I went to see
the doctor this morning.

19:07.447 --> 19:08.681
Apparently, I have
a torn ligament
in my shoulder.

19:08.715 --> 19:11.418
Uh, it's gonna be okay.

19:11.451 --> 19:13.453
Is it? Because
he said that I might not
be able to pitch again.

19:13.486 --> 19:14.554
This season?

19:15.555 --> 19:16.556
Ever.

19:24.464 --> 19:25.665
Eli! I need your help.

19:25.698 --> 19:27.700
Hey! Do you know
where Jeremy is?

19:27.734 --> 19:29.602
That is why
I need your help.

19:29.636 --> 19:31.704
You want me
to help you
look for Jeremy?

19:31.738 --> 19:34.607
No. Uh...
He is unavailable
at the moment.

19:34.641 --> 19:35.542
He's unavailable.

19:35.575 --> 19:38.545
And we don't have
his sketches or patterns

19:38.578 --> 19:40.513
for the Harrods
collaboration.
Any of them.

19:40.547 --> 19:42.515
Wait. But the Harrods
party is tonight.

19:42.549 --> 19:43.616
Yes, I'm very much
aware of that.

19:43.650 --> 19:45.652
No. And she can't know.

19:45.685 --> 19:47.554
Because?

19:47.587 --> 19:50.523
I might have been
responsible for why
Jeremy left so suddenly,

19:50.557 --> 19:52.559
and I really can't tell
Gray right now
we don't have time.

19:52.592 --> 19:54.494
So, can you just go with me
on this and help, please?

19:54.527 --> 19:56.496
Of course.
What do you need?

19:56.529 --> 19:58.731
Okay. Well, some of
your designs were used
in the collection, right?

19:58.765 --> 20:00.600
Uh, early on.

20:00.633 --> 20:03.503
But then they were
incorporated into
Jeremy's ideas.

20:03.536 --> 20:05.638
Okay. Well, how much do you
remember those ideas?

20:05.672 --> 20:09.676
Not much. Jeremy hasn't
exactly welcomed me
with open arms.

20:12.612 --> 20:14.781
Not necessarily.

20:14.814 --> 20:16.616
You're forgetting
there's one person

20:16.649 --> 20:19.519
that closely supervised
the entire line.

20:25.625 --> 20:28.661
Uh... Hey, India.

20:28.695 --> 20:31.531
You know what,
I haven't had
a chance to tell you

20:31.564 --> 20:34.601
how much I like
your new do.

20:34.634 --> 20:37.670
It's super sassy,
and it frames
your face perfectly.

20:37.704 --> 20:38.538
No.

20:38.571 --> 20:40.540
I haven't even
asked you anything yet.

20:40.573 --> 20:42.742
Then I'm saving you
the trouble.

20:42.775 --> 20:44.677
Where'd he go?

20:44.711 --> 20:46.713
Nobody knows.
He disappeared.

20:48.615 --> 20:51.551
He took all the Harrods
designs with him.

20:51.584 --> 20:54.621
Even more alarming
is the fact that
all three patterns are gone.

20:54.654 --> 20:55.855
Why would he do that?

20:57.590 --> 21:00.527
India. I know.
Jeremy told me everything.

21:00.560 --> 21:03.630
I know it wasn't you.
You never gave
our designs to Beau.

21:03.663 --> 21:06.699
And I tried to make
things right by
giving him an ultimatum,

21:06.733 --> 21:09.769
tell Gray or I would.
And so he bolted.

21:09.802 --> 21:11.704
And now I need your help.

21:11.738 --> 21:16.609
Let's re-cap.
You screwed me over,
got me fired,

21:16.643 --> 21:19.612
and now you're asking me
to help you save the day?

21:20.813 --> 21:24.651
If that's an apology,
it's gonna need
a lot of work.

21:25.752 --> 21:29.556
I'm sorry. I am.

21:29.589 --> 21:31.824
And I wouldn't blame you
if you didn't forgive me,

21:31.858 --> 21:33.826
but you're the only person
who knows Jeremy's designs

21:33.860 --> 21:35.662
well enough to
recreate them by tonight.

21:35.695 --> 21:37.830
(LAUGHS) Oh, Jane.

21:37.864 --> 21:39.866
Oh, God. I love to
watch you squirm.

21:41.601 --> 21:46.773
Good. Enjoy.
Go crazy. I deserve it.

21:46.806 --> 21:48.708
But your job
is on the line, too.

21:48.741 --> 21:50.843
Oh, yeah?
How did you come up with
that brilliant conclusion?

21:50.877 --> 21:52.845
Your new bosses are
going to be here tonight

21:52.879 --> 21:56.649
for a preview of a line that
you've been supervising.

21:56.683 --> 21:58.618
And something tells me
that when they get here

21:58.651 --> 22:01.754
and realize that
there is nothing
for them to preview,

22:01.788 --> 22:03.623
Donovan Decker
won't be the only one

22:03.656 --> 22:04.924
with their head
on the chopping block.

22:06.726 --> 22:07.894
I hate you, Jane.

22:20.540 --> 22:22.409
No. It's all wrong.

22:22.442 --> 22:24.911
Look, I told you,
we only saw
part of the design.

22:24.944 --> 22:26.112
What about the
cropped jacket?

22:26.145 --> 22:28.381
You said you hated
the cropped jacket.

22:28.415 --> 22:31.384
I lied. I wanted you guys
to work the weekend.
But this... This is terrible.

22:31.418 --> 22:32.419
Look, we're trying.

22:32.452 --> 22:34.487
Obviously not hard enough.

22:34.521 --> 22:37.390
What's this? I thought
the patterns were sent
for cutting and sewing.

22:37.424 --> 22:38.458
Where is Jeremy?

22:40.560 --> 22:43.396
He went home sick
with the flu.

22:43.430 --> 22:45.932
We're just making
a few little adjustments
to Jeremy's patterns,

22:45.965 --> 22:49.168
per some last minute
requests from Harrods.
Very minor.

22:49.201 --> 22:52.405
Fine. As long as you
make the deadline.

22:52.439 --> 22:55.508
Oh, and Jane,
the next time something
like this happens,

22:55.542 --> 22:57.444
don't keep it from me.
Understood?

22:58.177 --> 23:00.447
Yes, of course.

23:00.480 --> 23:03.149
So where is
Jeremy really?

23:03.182 --> 23:04.951
He's very sick.

23:04.984 --> 23:06.419
Really?

23:06.453 --> 23:08.455
He will be when
I'm done with him.

23:10.490 --> 23:11.558
Okay! Let's get to work.

23:11.591 --> 23:13.159
* So hot now

23:13.192 --> 23:15.428
* More glam
You superstar

23:15.462 --> 23:17.597
* More songs
Sing the melody

23:17.630 --> 23:20.433
* More beats
Dee-dee-dee-dee

23:24.604 --> 23:27.006
* I love it

23:28.508 --> 23:31.611
* I'm always thinking of it

23:34.013 --> 23:36.616
* La, la, la, la, la

23:38.485 --> 23:41.488
* La, la, la, la, la, la

23:42.622 --> 23:45.224
* Oh, yeah

23:45.257 --> 23:46.493
HeyHey.n.

23:46.526 --> 23:47.627
You're here kinda late.

23:47.660 --> 23:49.562
Just getting
caught up on some work.

23:49.596 --> 23:51.464
Can't those wait
until tomorrow?

23:51.498 --> 23:52.532
Somebody's gotta do it.

23:53.600 --> 23:54.634
You're avoiding your mom.

23:55.535 --> 23:56.569
That, too.

23:58.538 --> 24:00.006
You know, just because
we're taking a break,

24:00.039 --> 24:01.608
doesn't mean we can't talk.

24:01.641 --> 24:04.544
I'm right here.
Next door.
Happy to listen

24:06.613 --> 24:10.617
I know what she's doing.
She's gonna be all fun
and charming and funny,

24:10.650 --> 24:13.219
and then she's
just gonna leave.

24:13.252 --> 24:14.621
And I don't want her
to hurt Jane.

24:17.657 --> 24:21.594
And maybe you don't
want to get hurt again?

24:25.064 --> 24:26.599
Why don't we
get out of here?

24:26.633 --> 24:29.268
Get your mind off things,
maybe grab a bite to eat?

24:29.301 --> 24:33.606
Actually, Amanda's
getting some of the old gang
together at The Rack tonight.

24:33.640 --> 24:35.675
Wanna come?

24:35.708 --> 24:39.712
I'll pass. I just
remembered I have to
re-grout my bathroom.

24:45.618 --> 24:46.653
Bull's-eye!

24:46.686 --> 24:47.654
And that's game.

24:47.687 --> 24:49.689
Oh, come on!
You're cheating.

24:49.722 --> 24:51.257
How am I cheating?

24:51.290 --> 24:53.526
You've clearly played
darts before.

24:53.560 --> 24:55.061
Since when is
being good at
something cheating?

24:55.094 --> 24:56.729
Since right now.
That's when. Okay?

24:58.698 --> 24:59.699
(EXHALES)

25:01.100 --> 25:03.703
Oh, look at you!
Getting better.

25:03.736 --> 25:05.271
This time you missed
the busboy

25:05.304 --> 25:06.205
but you actually
made it into the wall!

25:06.238 --> 25:09.275
Ha! All right. All right.
All right. Fine.

25:09.308 --> 25:12.278
Since you're so good,
how about a little lesson?

25:12.311 --> 25:13.680
You sure your ego
can handle that?

25:14.614 --> 25:15.682
Bring it on.

25:15.715 --> 25:17.550
All right.

25:17.584 --> 25:19.619
First, let me
see your stance.

25:20.620 --> 25:22.088
Come on,
take it seriously!

25:22.121 --> 25:23.089
(LAUGHS)

25:23.122 --> 25:24.523
Legs apart.

25:25.692 --> 25:29.528
Remember, it's all
in the wrist, arm up.

25:31.330 --> 25:32.531
Now, go.

25:33.633 --> 25:35.134
(EXCLAIMSYeah!MPHANTLY)

25:35.735 --> 25:36.736
Ooh!

25:39.772 --> 25:41.641
What's wrong?

25:41.674 --> 25:44.310
Oh, it's just your bracelet.
Where'd you get it again?

25:44.343 --> 25:47.647
I don't know, some
thrift store downtown,
I don't remember.

25:48.748 --> 25:50.583
Do you want
to try it again?

25:50.617 --> 25:51.718
Nah. I think I'm done.

25:57.356 --> 25:58.691
We almost did it.

25:58.725 --> 26:02.662
We've got 20 minutes
to get all of these
patterns cut and sewn.

26:02.695 --> 26:04.363
What's wrong?

26:04.396 --> 26:05.665
(LOUD LAUGHTER)

26:09.368 --> 26:10.803
Can you take these
to Carter?

26:10.837 --> 26:13.172
Because, believe it or not,
I have a bigger emergency
to attend to!

26:13.740 --> 26:15.341
Sure.

26:15.374 --> 26:18.611
So that's why I stopped
working for congressmen!

26:18.645 --> 26:20.780
Mom! What are you
doing here?

26:20.813 --> 26:23.750
Oh, Jane your mother
is hysterical!

26:23.783 --> 26:25.752
Is she? I mean,
sure, she is.

26:25.785 --> 26:27.687
Did the patterns
get in on time?

26:27.720 --> 26:29.656
Yes. Yes, they did.

26:29.689 --> 26:32.659
Isn't it amazing
that Jane volunteers
so much time here.

26:32.692 --> 26:33.592
Is that what you call it?

26:33.626 --> 26:36.696
No, no. It's just that
it is so much fun.

26:36.729 --> 26:38.164
And it feels like
volunteering.

26:38.197 --> 26:39.365
Like it's not even work.

26:39.398 --> 26:40.767
And to think
my little girl...

26:40.800 --> 26:42.669
Who's not so
little anymore.

26:42.702 --> 26:44.637
Is balancing work
and high...

26:44.671 --> 26:47.640
And a high maintenance
lifestyle. It's crazy.

26:47.674 --> 26:49.408
Sorry, Gray.
Do you mind
if I borrow her

26:49.441 --> 26:51.811
for just one minute.
So sorry, Gray.
Just one second.

26:53.412 --> 26:54.313
What are you doing here?

26:54.346 --> 26:55.481
Ben said you were
gonna be working late,

26:55.514 --> 26:58.685
so I brought you dinner.
It's on your desk.
A lasagna.

26:58.718 --> 27:00.687
For 20. Share it
with the office.

27:00.720 --> 27:04.423
Oh, honey, I can't believe
this is where you intern...

27:04.456 --> 27:06.793
Oh, Mom, shh.
Stop talking.

27:06.826 --> 27:08.627
I need to
tell you something.

27:10.229 --> 27:12.732
They think
you're how old?

27:12.765 --> 27:14.667
I know, I know.
But I promise...

27:14.701 --> 27:15.702
But Jane...

27:15.735 --> 27:16.869
I know what you're thinking.

27:16.903 --> 27:20.406
That that would
make me the mother
of a 25 year-old!

27:20.439 --> 27:23.409
Mom, you are the mother
of a 25-year-old.

27:23.442 --> 27:25.745
They don't know that!

27:25.778 --> 27:28.214
Look, I appreciate you
coming down here,

27:28.247 --> 27:30.750
and bringing dinner,
for everyone,

27:30.783 --> 27:33.820
but there's just a few things
I have to do before
I come home. Okay?

27:33.853 --> 27:36.756
I completely understand.

27:36.789 --> 27:38.424
You're working.

27:38.457 --> 27:39.658
Illegally.

27:40.459 --> 27:42.695
I get it.
Trust me, I get it.

27:42.729 --> 27:44.697
There was this
one time in Bogata...

27:44.731 --> 27:45.765
Okay, Mom, not now...

27:45.798 --> 27:49.769
Oh, good,
you're still here.

27:49.802 --> 27:52.839
Oh, she was
just leaving.

27:52.872 --> 27:54.741
Gray, it was
a pleasure to meet you.

27:55.507 --> 27:56.976
Likewise.

27:57.009 --> 28:00.747
Oh, this was so much fun
but there's a lot we have
to do before the party.

28:00.780 --> 28:01.814
Party?

28:01.848 --> 28:04.450
Yes! Why don't you join us?

28:04.483 --> 28:05.484
I'd love to!

28:05.517 --> 28:06.853
Oh, she can't,
she really...

28:06.886 --> 28:08.687
We'll see you at 8:00.

28:10.857 --> 28:13.893
Mom, I don't know
if it's a good idea for you
to come to the party tonight.

28:13.926 --> 28:17.263
Why not?
Your boss just invited me.

28:17.296 --> 28:20.867
Well, it's just...
It's a professional
work thing...

28:20.900 --> 28:23.269
Jane, you don't
have to worry.

28:23.302 --> 28:24.737
I promise,

28:24.771 --> 28:26.739
I'll be like a fly
on the wall.

28:26.773 --> 28:28.775
You won't even know
I'm there.

28:28.808 --> 28:33.279
* Here I go, again on my own

28:33.312 --> 28:37.850
* Going down the only road
I've ever known *

28:44.523 --> 28:45.792
(ALL APPLAUDING)

28:50.096 --> 28:52.098
Mom, what are you doing?

28:52.131 --> 28:54.033
An encore.

28:54.066 --> 28:57.003
Yeah, about that.
What happened to
"fly on the wall?"

28:57.036 --> 28:59.906
I'm sorry.
Did I embarrass you?

28:59.939 --> 29:01.407
No, of course not.

29:01.440 --> 29:03.910
I mean, it was
a little awkward when
you sang The Bitch Is Back.

29:03.943 --> 29:05.978
Oh. Totally agree.

29:06.012 --> 29:07.947
That's a hard number
to pull off without drums.

29:07.980 --> 29:09.548
This isn't about
percussion, Mom.

29:09.581 --> 29:12.952
This is an important night
for Donovan Decker.
And the stakes are very high.

29:12.985 --> 29:15.087
Exactly.
And everybody's so tense.

29:15.121 --> 29:17.957
That's why I was trying
to lighten things up.

29:17.990 --> 29:19.926
Is something else
bothering you?

29:19.959 --> 29:23.062
No. No, I'm just on edge.

29:23.095 --> 29:24.296
It's been a tense day,

29:24.330 --> 29:27.133
and We really need
the Harrods people
to love this line.

29:27.166 --> 29:28.968
I don't mean to
take things out on you.

29:29.001 --> 29:30.136
Oh, don't worry
about me.

29:30.169 --> 29:33.039
The last thing
I want to do is
cause you any stress.

29:33.072 --> 29:35.942
ELI: Jane,

29:35.975 --> 29:38.210
you never told me
what an entertaining
mother you have.

29:38.244 --> 29:39.245
Hi, I'm Eli.

29:40.246 --> 29:41.981
"Fake Date" Eli?

29:42.248 --> 29:45.217
You're right, Jane.
Yummy!

29:45.251 --> 29:47.186
Mom, not now.

29:47.219 --> 29:50.022
Did you do that thing
we talNo. about?

29:50.056 --> 29:51.090
What thing was that?

29:51.123 --> 29:54.961
Oh. She's being shy.

29:54.994 --> 29:57.129
I can read this.
He'll say yes.

29:57.163 --> 29:58.230
Whatever it is,
I'm in.

29:58.264 --> 30:00.032
Ooh, I'm gonna
get a drink.

30:02.068 --> 30:04.971
GRAY: May I have your
attention, please?

30:05.004 --> 30:07.139
Donovan Decker is
excited to present

30:07.173 --> 30:11.077
its menswear collaboration
with Harrods for spring.

30:11.110 --> 30:14.981
We're pleased to offer you
a sneak peek today

30:15.014 --> 30:19.218
of what we believe
will be trending
tomorrow. Enjoy!

30:20.152 --> 30:21.253
(ALL APPLAUDING)

30:25.157 --> 30:28.127
Listen to that applause.
That's a good thing, right?

30:28.160 --> 30:31.097
I don't know.
Look at the people
from Harrods.

30:31.130 --> 30:33.199
They're notorious for
keeping their opinions
close to the vest.

30:35.301 --> 30:37.136
Oh, my God!
They're clapping!

30:37.169 --> 30:39.071
And smiling!

30:39.105 --> 30:42.208
I've never seen them
do that before.
They love it!

30:42.241 --> 30:47.146
I can't believe
I'm going to say this,
but we make a good team.

30:48.247 --> 30:52.151
Yeah, we do.

30:52.184 --> 30:55.054
Now, if you'll excuse me
I'm gonna go take credit
for everything. Hi!

31:08.300 --> 31:10.069
(SIGHS)

31:11.237 --> 31:14.140
So, thanks for a nice night.

31:14.306 --> 31:17.043
Yeah, sure.

31:17.076 --> 31:20.079
Is everything okay?
Something
you wanna talk about?

31:20.112 --> 31:21.347
No. I'm good.

31:23.249 --> 31:25.351
Anyway, I'll see you around.

31:28.254 --> 31:31.190
Okay. See ya.

31:52.144 --> 31:55.147
* You walked in
And it was sweet sunshine

31:55.181 --> 31:58.350
* I wanted to hold your hand
All the time

31:58.384 --> 32:02.088
* I picked you
My favorite flower

32:02.121 --> 32:05.224
* We smiled so much
Our cheeks hurt for hours

32:05.257 --> 32:08.360
* Tomorrow came different
And tomorrow came soon

32:08.394 --> 32:12.098
* You called me over
to see your room

32:12.131 --> 32:15.301
* When I walked in
You bumped my head

32:15.334 --> 32:19.105
* The blood ran pretty
All over your bed

32:19.138 --> 32:23.242
* Stu-stu-stupid pretty girl

32:23.275 --> 32:26.345
* Came around
And ruined my world

32:26.378 --> 32:29.215
* You set my head on fire

32:29.248 --> 32:32.318
* Pushed me down
and called me a liar

32:32.351 --> 32:36.388
* Stu-stu-stupid pretty girl

32:36.422 --> 32:40.159
* Came around
And ruined my world

32:40.192 --> 32:42.394
* You set my hair on fire

32:42.428 --> 32:46.198
* Pushed me down
And called me a liar

32:46.232 --> 32:49.301
* Baby, baby,
Why you treat me so bad?

32:49.335 --> 32:53.139
* Can't you see that
It makes me sad? *

32:53.172 --> 32:55.274
Can you believe it?
We did it.

32:56.175 --> 32:57.376
Yep. We did it.

32:58.344 --> 33:00.346
Don't do any cartwheels.

33:00.379 --> 33:04.183
Sorry. It's just difficult
for me to maintain
my excitement

33:04.216 --> 33:06.418
about avoiding
the truth all day.

33:06.452 --> 33:10.189
I, for one, thought
those models looked
so fabulous.

33:10.222 --> 33:11.457
Would you excuse me
for a moment?

33:13.325 --> 33:15.361
I love what you have on.
Who are you wearing?

33:15.394 --> 33:20.166
Oh! Kate Quimby!
I make most of
my clothes myself.

33:20.199 --> 33:22.201
Well, you have
quite the flair.

33:22.234 --> 33:24.436
I can see where
Jane gets her
penchant for design.

33:24.470 --> 33:26.438
It's in the genes.

33:26.472 --> 33:29.308
Well, I can tell you
what's not in the genes,
a responsible work ethic.

33:29.341 --> 33:31.177
That has to be taught.

33:31.210 --> 33:35.181
And you have done
a wonderful job
raising your daughter.

33:35.214 --> 33:37.249
Thank you.
I did my best.

33:46.425 --> 33:48.194
BILLY: (WHISPERS) Zoe!

33:48.227 --> 33:50.196
Billy. What are you
doing here?

33:50.229 --> 33:53.265
Saving you from trouble.
Now, come on.
You do not need to do this.

33:53.299 --> 33:54.366
Do what?

33:54.400 --> 33:57.336
I get it.
You want nice things.
Okay? We all do.

33:57.369 --> 33:59.338
But this is not
how you do it.

33:59.371 --> 34:02.374
Now, let's get out
of here before we
trip a motion detector!

34:02.408 --> 34:04.476
Billy... Let me explain, okay?

34:04.510 --> 34:07.313
No, let me explain.

34:07.346 --> 34:11.217
I've been to juvie.
You do not want to go there.

34:11.250 --> 34:12.718
You've got to turn
your life around.

34:12.751 --> 34:16.522
You're gonna start
by returning that bracelet
to whoever owns it! Okay?

34:19.291 --> 34:24.363
Why... Why do these people
have a picture of you
riding a horse?

34:36.308 --> 34:38.510
This is my house, Billy.
I live here.

34:38.544 --> 34:43.449
Wait. So, the bracelet,
it... It's yours?

34:43.482 --> 34:47.286
Yes. The bracelet's mine.
Okay? My family's rich.

34:47.319 --> 34:50.522
In fact, filthy.
We have a tennis court,
an indoor pool, and a butler.

34:50.556 --> 34:53.259
His name is Bert
and we call him Walter.

34:53.292 --> 34:54.193
That doesn't even
make sense.

34:54.226 --> 34:57.296
It doesn't have to.
We're loaded. Okay?

34:58.497 --> 35:01.400
So, go ahead.
Hate my guts.

35:02.434 --> 35:04.303
Why lie about it?

35:04.570 --> 35:06.305
Because of Lulu.

35:06.338 --> 35:07.373
Lulu?

35:07.406 --> 35:11.410
You kept saying
how she was
rich and spoiled,

35:11.443 --> 35:14.280
and how you'd never
make that mistake again.

35:14.313 --> 35:15.547
How she wasn't like "us".

35:17.449 --> 35:19.451
And the more I liked you,

35:19.485 --> 35:22.488
the more I wanted to stay
in the "us" zone, you know?

35:24.390 --> 35:27.426
Because the truth is, Billy,
I really like you.

35:28.494 --> 35:32.331
And I really like
the idea of "us".

35:34.366 --> 35:35.501
Well, why didn't you
just say that?

35:45.344 --> 35:48.447
C'mon! There you go.
Yay!

35:48.480 --> 35:51.417
I can't believe
Thin Johnny can
still drink like that!

35:51.450 --> 35:53.519
I can't believe we're still
calling him Thin Johnny.

35:53.552 --> 35:55.421
(LAUGHING)

35:55.454 --> 35:59.325
Oh, Ben, I forgot
how funny you are.

35:59.358 --> 36:02.461
So, I'm kind of
embarrassed to say this,

36:02.494 --> 36:03.629
but, you know,
I had a crush on you
in high school?

36:04.496 --> 36:06.365
You did not.

36:06.398 --> 36:08.534
Oh, I totally did.
Don't pretend
you didn't know that.

36:08.567 --> 36:10.336
I'm not pretending.

36:10.369 --> 36:12.504
It's just... You were
going out with Jason...

36:12.538 --> 36:14.573
McCYeah.ter.

36:14.606 --> 36:16.442
So, what happened there?

36:16.475 --> 36:18.444
We broke up
right before
graduation, remember?

36:18.477 --> 36:20.446
I thought,
I don't know,

36:20.479 --> 36:23.415
I thought maybe
you and I could get
together before college.

36:23.449 --> 36:26.485
But I was too late.
You were already
dating Jenny.

36:26.518 --> 36:29.655
Right. God, seems like
such a long time ago.

36:31.490 --> 36:33.559
Feels like just
yesterday to me.

36:33.592 --> 36:37.629
Not to me. You know,
a lot has happened since
we graduated high school.

36:37.663 --> 36:41.567
Oh, no. Don't tell me
I'm too late again?

36:41.600 --> 36:44.603
Because Rita Shaw
told me that you're single.

36:45.637 --> 36:47.473
She told you that?

36:47.506 --> 36:50.376
Yep. Isn't that true?

36:50.409 --> 36:54.646
Well, there was someone
and we broke up.

36:56.548 --> 36:58.484
But to be honest,
I'm not

37:00.419 --> 37:03.589
entirely sure
I'm over her just yet.

37:09.495 --> 37:10.596
Hey, Rita.

37:10.629 --> 37:13.465
Hi, Rita, what are
you doing here?

37:14.500 --> 37:16.402
Same as you.

37:16.435 --> 37:20.406
When Ben invited me to
meet up with the old gang,
how could I refuse?

37:20.439 --> 37:22.574
Oh, well the old gang
is right over there.

37:22.608 --> 37:24.510
So you should just
head on over,

37:24.543 --> 37:26.612
see if they can
recognize you without
all that head gear.

37:26.645 --> 37:29.415
I'm good. But I'd be
better with a drink.

37:29.448 --> 37:30.682
Ben, white wine?

37:30.716 --> 37:32.718
Yeah, Ben,
I would love another red.

37:36.455 --> 37:37.589
Happy to oblige.

37:42.728 --> 37:47.466
Forget what I said before.
Ben Quimby is mine,
so back off.

37:47.499 --> 37:48.734
You had your chance.
It's my turn now.

37:50.736 --> 37:52.704
Game on.

37:52.738 --> 37:55.741
Game already started.
And it's too bad
you're sitting on the bench.

37:57.609 --> 37:58.710
Ladies.

38:13.625 --> 38:18.597
Why the long face?
You should be celebrating.

38:18.630 --> 38:22.501
Gray said it herself,
this party is
a huge success.

38:22.768 --> 38:24.670
You did an amazing job!

38:26.638 --> 38:29.608
No, it only looks like
I did an amazing job.

38:30.776 --> 38:32.478
Just like
you made it look like

38:32.511 --> 38:34.546
you did an amazing job
raising me, tonight.

38:36.715 --> 38:38.584
Isn't that what
you told Gray?

38:45.524 --> 38:47.659
Why did you
leave us, Mom?

38:47.693 --> 38:49.628
Why did you leave
and not come back?

38:49.661 --> 38:51.630
This isn't exactly the time.

38:51.663 --> 38:54.666
I have a feeling it's never
gonna be the right time
with you. Right, Mom?

38:55.767 --> 38:58.804
But, me? I'm done
covering up the truth.

39:01.573 --> 39:02.674
I've been doing it all day.

39:05.544 --> 39:07.746
Now if you'll excuse me,
there's something
I have to make right.

39:13.819 --> 39:17.656
Gray, can I just say,
you look simply divine
this evening.

39:17.689 --> 39:19.625
I love what
you are wearing.

39:19.658 --> 39:22.728
You mean it?
You're not going to rip me on
the Fashion Police later on?

39:22.761 --> 39:25.531
Who me? Of course not.

39:25.564 --> 39:27.699
But who are we kidding?
You know I will.

39:29.601 --> 39:30.769
Gray, I need to
talk to you.

39:30.802 --> 39:32.571
It can wait, Jane.

39:32.604 --> 39:33.805
Actually, it can't.

39:33.839 --> 39:35.707
It's okay, Gray.
I'll catch you later.

39:38.677 --> 39:39.711
This better be good.

39:40.779 --> 39:42.714
Actually, it's bad.

39:43.715 --> 39:45.551
Jeremy's not home sick,

39:45.584 --> 39:47.653
he disappeared
with the designs
from Harrods.

39:47.686 --> 39:48.820
All of them.

39:48.854 --> 39:51.623
I found out Jeremy
was the mole.

39:51.657 --> 39:54.593
He was the one giving
our designs to Beau,
not India.

39:54.626 --> 39:57.796
And instead of
telling you myself,

39:57.829 --> 40:00.799
I waited for him to admit it.

40:00.832 --> 40:02.734
And he vanished.

40:03.835 --> 40:05.637
I'm sorry.

40:06.738 --> 40:08.674
I should've
told you sooner.

40:09.875 --> 40:13.879
And if you decide
to fire me because
of it, I'll understand.

40:27.759 --> 40:29.595
Where is she?

40:29.628 --> 40:30.862
She's in her room,
crying her eyes out.

40:31.897 --> 40:32.864
I want to go talk to her.

40:32.898 --> 40:34.800
She doesn't want
to talk to you.

40:34.833 --> 40:38.737
I can talk for myself, Ben.

40:38.770 --> 40:42.641
Actually, I think
it's my turn to talk.

40:49.815 --> 40:54.620
You asked me tonight
why I left.

40:54.653 --> 40:59.658
I could tell you
it was because I was
too young to be a mom,

40:59.691 --> 41:01.627
I felt overwhelmed,

41:01.660 --> 41:03.762
your father was
a better parent
than I was...

41:06.665 --> 41:08.734
I could go on and on
about all that,

41:08.767 --> 41:10.902
but there is no excuse
for what I did.

41:10.936 --> 41:16.775
So, if it's okay,
I would rather talk
about why I'm back.

41:21.747 --> 41:23.715
All I want to do is
get to know you.

41:25.884 --> 41:26.952
Both of you.

41:30.856 --> 41:32.891
Listen, I'm the first
to admit, I am...

41:34.926 --> 41:37.863
...never gonna win a
"Mother of the Year" award.

41:37.896 --> 41:39.765
You could say that again.

41:39.798 --> 41:40.799
Ben.

41:42.868 --> 41:46.805
But I promise you,
I swear,

41:46.838 --> 41:49.975
if you give me
this opportunity,
I will not let you down.

41:52.978 --> 41:54.980
We'll start fresh.

41:56.915 --> 41:59.685
And if I do it right,

41:59.718 --> 42:02.988
some day when you
call me "Mom",

42:06.758 --> 42:08.727
it will feel earned.

42:14.933 --> 42:16.902
But if that doesn't
fly with you,

42:16.935 --> 42:19.971
I can still pack my bags
and be gone in the morning.

42:26.812 --> 42:30.015
I... I would like you to stay.

42:48.900 --> 42:50.802
Fine.

42:50.836 --> 42:53.905
But I'm not eating
your pancakes,
so stop pushing them.

42:57.909 --> 42:58.944
(DOOR CLOSES)

43:01.913 --> 43:04.783
He's not really
an evening person, either.
