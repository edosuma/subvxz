00:42.960 --> 00:44.632
- Chow time!
- It's time!

00:44.800 --> 00:47.598
Floyd, step up to the door. Dinner time.

00:51.680 --> 00:53.636
Only my friends call me Floyd.

00:53.840 --> 00:55.120
You ain't got no friends, Floyd.

00:57.640 --> 00:58.640
What's that?

00:58.800 --> 01:00.836
- That is called loaf.
- Loaf.

01:01.000 --> 01:03.195
It's got a little bit of pasghetti
in there.

01:03.360 --> 01:04.759
Toenails.

01:05.440 --> 01:06.440
Rat shit.

01:06.600 --> 01:08.636
Everything a growing fella needs,
like you.

01:10.400 --> 01:12.496
Come here. Can I tell you something?
Can I tell you a secret?

01:12.520 --> 01:13.555
Yeah.

01:13.800 --> 01:15.074
One day,

01:15.240 --> 01:17.913
somehow, some way,
I'm gonna get outta here.

01:18.080 --> 01:22.392
And I'm gonna rain down on you
like the Holy Ghost.

01:24.480 --> 01:26.080
Man, you just threatened a staff member.

01:26.680 --> 01:28.830
- Yeah?
- Yeah, you have.

01:29.000 --> 01:30.035
Do something.

01:30.520 --> 01:32.033
Let's have some fun.

02:01.040 --> 02:02.678
Open the goddamn gate!

02:02.840 --> 02:04.876
Come on, guys.
Don't waste my time.

02:05.360 --> 02:08.875
Sector C! Pull your heads outta your ass!
Boss is on deck!

02:11.560 --> 02:12.560
Open!

02:12.800 --> 02:14.136
Bravo 14, open perimeter fence.

02:14.160 --> 02:15.376
Stay back!

02:15.400 --> 02:17.868
If she moves, fire her up, all right?

02:19.520 --> 02:21.556
You gonna come down from there or what?

02:24.640 --> 02:25.755
Look at you.

02:28.720 --> 02:30.160
You know the rules, hotness.

02:30.280 --> 02:31.633
You gotta keep off these bars.

02:31.800 --> 02:33.677
- What, these bars?
- Yeah. Those bars.

02:34.560 --> 02:36.391
Oh, my God.

02:38.200 --> 02:40.953
You are really
in bad shape upstairs, lady!

02:41.920 --> 02:43.360
Gonna come in here and tell me that?

02:43.760 --> 02:45.352
Or are you too scared?

02:45.960 --> 02:47.393
Come on, I'm bored.

02:47.600 --> 02:49.238
I'm bored. Play with me.

02:49.400 --> 02:51.640
You put five of my guards
in the hospital, honey.

02:51.760 --> 02:53.512
No one's gonna play with you.

02:54.080 --> 02:55.080
You sleep on the ground.

02:55.720 --> 02:59.554
I sleep where I want,
when I want, with who I want.

03:01.280 --> 03:02.599
Oh, man. I love you.

03:03.280 --> 03:04.759
Alpha One, hit her.

03:07.120 --> 03:10.271
Come on, man. You're
six foot four. She's a tiny little girl.

03:11.760 --> 03:13.176
You got a choice tonight.
What we got here?

03:13.200 --> 03:15.839
We got chocolate, strawberry, or vanilla.

03:16.000 --> 03:19.310
My job is to keep you alive until you die.
Do you understand that?

03:19.480 --> 03:20.480
Ahh!

03:20.800 --> 03:21.800
Spring break!

03:25.960 --> 03:26.960
Whoo.

03:27.760 --> 03:31.070
That is just a whole lot of pretty
in a whole lot of crazy.

03:51.840 --> 03:54.752
The world changed
when Superman flew across the sky.

03:56.320 --> 03:58.515
And then it changed again when he didn't.

04:09.320 --> 04:11.311
And that is why I'm here.

04:33.200 --> 04:34.553
We lose a national hero,

04:34.720 --> 04:37.040
but you sit there looking like
the cat that ate the canary.

04:37.280 --> 04:38.872
I've eaten a lot of canaries.

04:39.640 --> 04:40.709
It's taken some work.

04:41.600 --> 04:44.910
But I finally have them.
The worst of the worst.

04:47.360 --> 04:50.875
There's rumors, Amanda,
that some of them have abilities.

04:51.600 --> 04:53.397
Well, the rumors are right.

04:53.600 --> 04:56.034
You know what the problem
with a metahuman is?

04:56.200 --> 04:57.269
The human part.

04:57.480 --> 05:00.677
We got lucky with Superman.
He shared our values.

05:00.840 --> 05:02.034
The next Superman might not.

05:02.200 --> 05:03.838
You're playing with fire, Amanda.

05:04.000 --> 05:06.036
I'm fighting fire with fire.

05:06.240 --> 05:07.416
You're not going to pitch us that

05:07.440 --> 05:10.398
Task Force X project
of yours again, are you?

05:10.560 --> 05:11.560
Yes.

05:11.960 --> 05:13.360
But this time, you're gonna listen.

05:15.400 --> 05:18.278
Floyd Lawton, aka Deadshot.

05:34.400 --> 05:36.960
He's the most wanted hitman in the world.

05:41.440 --> 05:44.113
Let's say he has an elite clientele.

05:45.280 --> 05:47.589
- What?
- Hey, Angelo.

05:47.760 --> 05:50.877
This is the exterminator
you called for your rat problem.

05:51.040 --> 05:52.712
My account's looking a little thin.

05:54.240 --> 05:56.595
No one gets paid until
what needs to get done gets done.

05:56.760 --> 05:58.751
Nope. That's not the rules.
No money, no honey.

06:00.520 --> 06:02.158
Whoa. Here's your boy right now.

06:03.720 --> 06:05.915
With about 20 of his new best friends.

06:10.800 --> 06:12.518
I'm still seeing zeroes over here, Angie.

06:12.720 --> 06:15.029
Listen, stop being cute and do your job!

06:16.120 --> 06:17.896
They're taking him
outta the car now.

06:17.920 --> 06:20.957
In about 30 seconds,
your window is gonna close forever.

06:21.120 --> 06:24.032
Okay. Okay, okay. Relax.
There was an accounting error.

06:25.400 --> 06:26.799
We sent it.

06:26.960 --> 06:29.554
Now double it for being a dickhead.
You got 10 seconds.

06:29.720 --> 06:31.551
We're not the kind of people
you play with.

06:31.720 --> 06:33.517
Did you just... Did you threaten me?

06:33.680 --> 06:36.600
This dude's gonna get a sore throat
from all the singing he's about to do.

06:36.640 --> 06:37.789
You son of a bitch.

06:40.160 --> 06:42.116
Pleasure doing business with you, Angie.

07:00.280 --> 07:03.909
But everyone has a weakness.
And a weakness can be leveraged.

07:04.080 --> 07:07.072
His is an 11 -year-old honor student
in Gotham City.

07:07.280 --> 07:08.280
His daughter.

07:08.840 --> 07:11.115
So we watched her and waited.

07:11.320 --> 07:12.912
You should talk to Mama more.

07:13.760 --> 07:14.829
Yeah, yeah, I know.

07:15.000 --> 07:16.797
Mama stays in bed a lot.

07:16.960 --> 07:19.110
Yeah. She's still going out at night?

07:19.280 --> 07:22.511
Dad, it's okay. I can take care of her.

07:23.600 --> 07:25.477
I know how to make pancakes now.

07:25.640 --> 07:27.517
Hey, babe, that's beautiful.

07:27.680 --> 07:29.511
Um, she's supposed to be
taking care of you.

07:29.760 --> 07:31.520
You know, that's how
that's supposed to work.

07:33.720 --> 07:35.517
I want you to come live with me.

07:36.240 --> 07:40.119
All right? I came into some resources.
I'mma get us a spot.

07:40.280 --> 07:42.032
It's gonna be nice, all right?

07:42.200 --> 07:45.476
Mama says I can't live with you
because you kill people.

07:46.160 --> 07:49.038
That's not true.
That's a lie. She's lying to you.

07:49.200 --> 07:52.272
Daddy... I know you do bad things.

07:53.040 --> 07:55.270
Don't worry, I still love you.

07:58.400 --> 07:59.549
Come on.

08:00.880 --> 08:02.757
- And you caught him?
- Not me.

08:02.960 --> 08:06.077
I just gave an anonymous tip
to the right guy in Gotham City.

08:06.240 --> 08:09.357
I'mma figure this out. All right?

08:14.200 --> 08:15.320
It's over, Deadshot.

08:16.680 --> 08:18.640
I don't want to do this
in front of your daughter.

08:27.880 --> 08:29.950
- Daddy, please.
- Zoe, move!

08:30.600 --> 08:32.750
Please, Daddy. Don't do it.

08:34.919 --> 08:36.068
Please.

08:37.440 --> 08:38.440
Don't do it.

08:49.960 --> 08:50.960
All right.

08:59.120 --> 09:00.473
Love you, Daddy.

09:01.720 --> 09:03.790
So now we have the man who never misses.

09:03.960 --> 09:04.960
Where'd you put him?

09:05.120 --> 09:07.480
Let's just say, I put him in a hole
and threw away the hole.

09:10.000 --> 09:11.035
Harley Quinn.

09:19.440 --> 09:21.556
Before she ran off
and joined the circus,

09:21.720 --> 09:24.154
she was known as Dr. Harleen Quinzel.

09:24.320 --> 09:26.595
A psychiatrist at Arkham Asylum.

09:27.720 --> 09:30.632
She was assigned to The Clown himself.

09:30.840 --> 09:32.717
Dr. Quinzel.

09:33.520 --> 09:35.240
You know,
I live for these moments with you.

09:36.600 --> 09:38.670
- What do you got?
- I got you a kitty.

09:40.000 --> 09:41.149
So thoughtful.

09:41.320 --> 09:44.596
She thought she was curing him,
but she was falling in love.

09:46.640 --> 09:49.279
There is something
you could do for me, doctor.

09:49.480 --> 09:50.480
Anything. I mean, yeah.

09:51.760 --> 09:53.876
I need a machine gun.

09:56.160 --> 09:57.195
A machine gun?

09:59.480 --> 10:02.074
Talk about a workplace romance gone wrong.

10:13.360 --> 10:14.588
Get off me.

10:15.520 --> 10:16.520
Shh!

10:18.760 --> 10:20.910
What do we have here?

10:22.360 --> 10:24.828
I did everything you said. I helped you.

10:25.000 --> 10:26.000
Ah.

10:26.720 --> 10:28.358
You helped me.

10:28.560 --> 10:30.994
By erasing my mind?

10:31.160 --> 10:34.755
What few faded memories I had.

10:35.760 --> 10:36.875
No.

10:37.560 --> 10:41.553
You left me in a black hole
of rage and confusion.

10:41.720 --> 10:45.110
Is that the medicine
you practice, Dr. Quinzel?

10:45.280 --> 10:47.236
What are you gonna do?
You gonna kill me, Mr. J?

10:47.400 --> 10:48.719
What?

10:51.160 --> 10:52.912
Oh, I'm not gonna kill ya.

10:53.840 --> 10:55.637
I'm just gonna hurt ya

10:55.840 --> 10:59.992
really, really bad.

11:00.160 --> 11:01.160
You think so?

11:01.760 --> 11:03.751
Well, I can take it.

11:04.760 --> 11:08.639
I wouldn't want you to break
those perfect porcelain-capped teeth

11:08.800 --> 11:11.633
when the juice hits your brain.

11:18.680 --> 11:21.717
They became the king
and queen of Gotham City.

11:21.880 --> 11:24.872
And God help anyone
who disrespected the queen.

11:25.560 --> 11:27.039
We finally meet.

11:27.200 --> 11:28.456
Nah, he don't shake hands.

11:28.480 --> 11:30.948
But sit down and have a drink.

11:34.760 --> 11:35.875
Hey, J.

11:36.040 --> 11:39.396
On behalf of everybody, welcome back.

11:39.560 --> 11:42.120
I wanted to come by
and personally say thank you.

11:42.280 --> 11:44.874
You making me good money.
I'm making you good money.

11:45.440 --> 11:47.635
Are you sweet talking me?

11:50.640 --> 11:52.551
I love this guy.

11:53.240 --> 11:55.470
He's so intense!

11:59.760 --> 12:01.637
Mmm. You're a lucky man.

12:03.040 --> 12:04.837
You got a bad bitch.

12:07.400 --> 12:08.958
Oh, that she is.

12:10.480 --> 12:12.516
The fire in my loins.

12:14.400 --> 12:16.152
The itch in my crotch.

12:16.320 --> 12:21.189
The one, the only,
the infamous Harley Quinn!

12:31.160 --> 12:33.116
Oh, come to Daddy.

12:34.760 --> 12:36.478
Puddin'!

12:37.240 --> 12:38.275
Listen,

12:38.480 --> 12:42.632
you are my gift
to this handsome hunka hunka!

12:42.800 --> 12:45.360
You belong to him now.

12:45.520 --> 12:46.839
Well...

12:49.960 --> 12:51.313
You're cute.

12:51.760 --> 12:53.079
You want me?

12:54.320 --> 12:55.833
I'm all yours.

12:59.440 --> 13:00.440
I don't want no beef.

13:00.600 --> 13:03.034
You don't want no beef?
You don't want no beef?

13:03.200 --> 13:05.270
Why, what's wrong?
You don't like me?

13:05.440 --> 13:07.112
Fine. Don't waste my time then.

13:07.280 --> 13:08.508
This is your lady.

13:08.720 --> 13:11.871
Look, are you enjoying yourself?

13:13.360 --> 13:14.554
No.

13:15.240 --> 13:16.434
That's your lady, Joker.

13:16.600 --> 13:17.600
That's right.

13:17.800 --> 13:18.869
Yo, J.

13:22.520 --> 13:24.120
And that was just the beginning.

13:32.880 --> 13:34.711
Come on, Puddin'. Do it!

13:35.840 --> 13:36.840
Oh.

13:38.000 --> 13:39.353
We have got company.

13:39.520 --> 13:41.670
Batsy, Batsy, Batsy.

13:44.200 --> 13:45.952
She's crazier than him.

13:46.120 --> 13:47.917
And more fearless.

13:48.560 --> 13:51.393
Stupid Bat, you're ruining date night!

13:54.080 --> 13:55.195
Puddin'.

13:57.680 --> 13:59.591
Puddin', I can't swim!

14:36.960 --> 14:41.078
But the Bat got her, too.
She's in the same hole as Deadshot.

14:55.640 --> 14:56.993
And then there's the Aussie.

14:57.720 --> 14:59.153
Digger Harkness.

14:59.320 --> 15:02.153
Or as the tabloids call him,
Captain Boomerang.

15:10.600 --> 15:13.319
We're gonna be rich.

15:13.600 --> 15:14.794
Yeah, you and me, mate.

15:14.960 --> 15:16.359
Go and get the car.

15:16.560 --> 15:18.790
He robbed every bank
in Australia at least once.

15:18.960 --> 15:22.077
Then he came to America
for a fresh target set.

15:24.400 --> 15:26.038
Doesn't work well with others.

15:31.200 --> 15:32.792
No honor among thieves, eh?

15:34.840 --> 15:37.832
But he tangled with a metahuman
and lived to tell about it.

15:38.520 --> 15:41.717
And have you heard of
the pyrokinetic homeboy?

15:45.520 --> 15:46.953
How'd you catch him?

15:47.120 --> 15:48.678
We didn't. He surrendered.

15:50.520 --> 15:54.229
Chato Santana.
On the streets they call him El Diablo.

15:54.400 --> 15:56.914
This LA gangbanger thought
he was king of the world...

15:58.240 --> 15:59.559
...until he lost his queen.

16:02.680 --> 16:05.797
Gets jumped in a prison riot
and incinerates half the yard.

16:05.960 --> 16:08.076
The security video is incredible.

16:12.320 --> 16:14.709
Oh, Jesus. The hell is that?

16:14.880 --> 16:16.518
His name is Waylon Jones.

16:17.120 --> 16:19.793
Evolution took a step
backwards with this one.

16:21.920 --> 16:25.151
Yo, K.C., it's supper.

16:25.320 --> 16:26.992
Go ahead, open that up, B.

16:30.760 --> 16:32.440
Got something
real nice for you today, boy.

16:33.000 --> 16:35.036
Hey, boss,
it true he chewed a dude's hand off?

16:36.800 --> 16:39.633
Look at that, right there.
Vulcanized rubber.

16:44.880 --> 16:46.233
Give me that, Smitty.

16:47.400 --> 16:48.549
Where you at?

16:48.720 --> 16:50.073
Don't make me get you.

16:50.600 --> 16:52.431
They call him Killer Croc.

16:56.760 --> 16:58.080
Here you are! You hungry?

16:58.200 --> 17:01.272
You want some food?
Go ahead, feed the man.

17:01.960 --> 17:03.552
What are you in the mood for tonight?

17:03.720 --> 17:08.396
I got a double cheeseburger,
onion rings, a little coleslaw.

17:08.880 --> 17:11.189
Or a giant skinless goat.

17:20.680 --> 17:22.193
He looked like a monster.

17:23.119 --> 17:25.236
So they treated him like a monster.

17:26.880 --> 17:29.348
Then he became a monster.

17:33.640 --> 17:35.551
He was chased out of Gotham by the Bat.

17:35.720 --> 17:38.314
Went searching for sanctuary elsewhere.

17:38.480 --> 17:39.879
He never found it.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.309
I saved the best for last.

17:50.480 --> 17:52.596
- The witch.
- A witch?

17:52.800 --> 17:56.031
I'm talking a flying, spell-casting,
making-shit-disappear witch.

17:56.200 --> 17:59.033
A sorceress from another dimension.
Another world.

18:01.000 --> 18:03.833
Archeologist Dr. June Moone,

18:05.080 --> 18:07.071
wandered into the wrong cave.

18:15.000 --> 18:17.639
June...

18:20.920 --> 18:22.880
She opened something she shouldn't have...

18:34.160 --> 18:37.630
...releasing a metahuman more powerful
than any we've encountered.

18:38.840 --> 18:40.068
The Enchantress.

18:45.960 --> 18:48.076
She inhabits Dr. Moone's body now.

18:48.800 --> 18:49.869
And where is this witch?

18:50.480 --> 18:51.913
In my pocket.

18:52.080 --> 18:54.230
Now tell him
why she won't turn you into a frog.

18:54.440 --> 18:57.273
Some say the witch
has a secret buried heart,

18:57.440 --> 18:59.908
and whoever finds it
can control the witch.

19:00.080 --> 19:01.760
So we searched the cave
where she turned up

19:01.880 --> 19:03.518
and we found her heart.

19:07.080 --> 19:08.479
That thing's her heart?

19:08.720 --> 19:10.711
Mmm-hmm. She's vulnerable without it.

19:10.960 --> 19:13.474
You want to put our national security
in the hands of

19:13.640 --> 19:16.837
witches, gangbangers, and crocodiles?

19:17.000 --> 19:18.416
Don't forget about The Joker's girlfriend.

19:18.440 --> 19:19.555
These are villains, Amanda.

19:19.760 --> 19:21.671
What makes you think you can control them?

19:22.240 --> 19:24.800
Because getting people to act
against their own self-interest

19:24.960 --> 19:27.076
for the national security
of the United States

19:27.240 --> 19:28.912
is what I do for a living.

19:29.080 --> 19:32.914
You take the finest special forces officer
this nation has ever produced,

19:33.080 --> 19:34.195
Colonel Rick Flag.

19:57.920 --> 19:59.433
Help me.

19:59.600 --> 20:01.280
I assigned him to watch Dr. Moone,

20:01.440 --> 20:04.238
and just as I hoped, it got personal.

20:04.920 --> 20:06.512
Are you gonna kiss me or not?

20:06.720 --> 20:08.278
I have the witch's heart.

20:08.440 --> 20:10.271
And Dr. Moone has his.

20:11.840 --> 20:14.718
Now he'll follow my orders as Holy Writ.

20:17.520 --> 20:19.590
In a world of flying men and monsters,

20:19.760 --> 20:22.797
this is the only way
to protect our country.

20:26.360 --> 20:30.035
What if Superman had decided to fly down,

20:30.200 --> 20:31.997
rip off the roof of the White House

20:32.160 --> 20:33.840
and grab the President
of the United States

20:34.000 --> 20:35.160
right out of the Oval Office?

20:36.000 --> 20:37.433
Who would've stopped him?

20:38.600 --> 20:41.592
We got contingency plans
for nukes in North Korea,

20:41.800 --> 20:44.030
anthrax in our mail.
We got fluoride in our water.

20:44.200 --> 20:48.876
But what happens if the next Superman
becomes a terrorist?

20:50.000 --> 20:52.116
Amanda Waller has a plan. Amanda?

20:52.280 --> 20:54.589
I wanna build a team
of some very bad people

20:54.760 --> 20:56.398
who I think can do some good.

20:56.560 --> 20:59.028
Like fight the next war,
defeat the next Superman.

20:59.200 --> 21:00.679
Not on my watch.

21:00.840 --> 21:04.276
You're not putting those monsters
back out on the street in our name.

21:04.440 --> 21:06.715
General, we run them
covertly, non-attributed.

21:06.880 --> 21:08.359
Strictly need to know.

21:08.520 --> 21:10.670
And if they get caught,
we throw them under the bus.

21:11.320 --> 21:13.436
The next war will be fought
with these metahumans.

21:13.600 --> 21:15.591
Ours, or theirs.

21:15.760 --> 21:18.149
We're not the only ones
kicking up rocks looking for them.

21:18.320 --> 21:20.390
You know we can't control these people.

21:26.240 --> 21:27.673
June, be strong.

21:28.960 --> 21:30.029
Dr. Moone.

21:55.080 --> 21:56.638
Enchantress.

22:11.240 --> 22:13.117
Meet the Enchantress.

22:13.280 --> 22:16.397
Everything we know about her
is in your briefing packs.

22:16.600 --> 22:19.319
She's walked this earth
for a very long time

22:19.520 --> 22:21.750
and will likely be here
when we're long gone.

22:21.920 --> 22:24.480
This meeting is now a magic show?

22:24.640 --> 22:27.632
Magic or not, this girl can do
some pretty incredible things.

22:30.280 --> 22:31.793
Go get it, girl.

22:47.360 --> 22:51.433
How about a little something
from the weapons ministry vault in Tehran?

23:00.760 --> 23:03.593
We've been chasing these plans for years.

23:05.800 --> 23:07.995
Uh, please don't touch me.
Please don't touch me.

23:08.160 --> 23:10.116
Thank you. We'd like Dr. Moone back.

23:19.320 --> 23:20.833
Enchantress.

23:22.920 --> 23:24.478
Please. Please.

23:24.640 --> 23:26.870
I'm sorry, I can't do that again.

23:27.040 --> 23:28.598
Flag, get her out of here.

23:31.320 --> 23:36.314
I move to, uh, authorize Amanda Waller
to establish Task Force X

23:36.480 --> 23:38.038
under the ARGUS program.

23:40.320 --> 23:41.673
All right.

23:42.080 --> 23:43.877
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

23:58.400 --> 23:59.833
I know you do bad things.

24:00.840 --> 24:03.513
Don't worry, I still love you.

24:16.600 --> 24:18.520
Welcome to Belle Reve,
special security barracks.

24:18.560 --> 24:19.879
How you doing, man?

24:20.040 --> 24:21.760
Why don't you kiss her ass?
She's in charge.

24:21.920 --> 24:23.592
Welcome, ma'am. How are you?

24:23.760 --> 24:25.716
I'm here to assist you in any way.

24:26.400 --> 24:27.719
Where are they?

24:45.160 --> 24:47.151
Are you the Devil?

24:49.440 --> 24:50.919
Maybe.

25:20.800 --> 25:22.791
Ain't you scared?

25:27.760 --> 25:30.069
Why'd they put you down here?

25:31.880 --> 25:33.518
I asked.

25:37.720 --> 25:39.119
Open that gate.

25:45.240 --> 25:46.992
Yo, ese.

25:47.160 --> 25:48.752
Hola, amigo.

25:49.920 --> 25:52.115
Put that burrito down.
You got visitors, man.

26:03.480 --> 26:06.233
What's up? Hey, you want some of this?

26:06.400 --> 26:07.400
Then come down here.

26:08.560 --> 26:10.118
That ain't me.

26:10.280 --> 26:11.280
That wasn't you?

26:11.440 --> 26:14.637
Nah, they say it's me, but that ain't me.
That guy's gone.

26:14.840 --> 26:15.989
He's dead.

26:16.160 --> 26:18.116
- And yet, here you are.
- Ma'am.

26:18.280 --> 26:19.679
Let me try to talk to him.

26:24.440 --> 26:26.670
You wanna die in here, buddy?

26:26.840 --> 26:29.195
You got a real shot
at walking the block again.

26:29.400 --> 26:32.153
Have a nice cold beer, a nice meal.

26:32.840 --> 26:33.840
A woman.

26:34.000 --> 26:37.709
Look, man, you ain't the first to ask,
and you ain't gonna be the last.

26:37.880 --> 26:39.359
Ask what?

26:39.520 --> 26:42.512
I'm a man, okay? I ain't no weapon.

26:43.600 --> 26:46.194
I'mma die in peace
before I raise my fists again.

26:47.640 --> 26:49.471
I've caused enough harm.

26:58.960 --> 27:00.080
All right, unlock him.

27:00.560 --> 27:02.312
- What?
- You heard me.

27:02.480 --> 27:03.708
You know what this man can do?

27:03.880 --> 27:07.031
I'm here to find out. Lose the restraints.

27:12.200 --> 27:13.394
Okay.

27:14.720 --> 27:17.359
What is this? Uh, cheerleading tryouts?

27:18.280 --> 27:19.872
Let's go. Let's see what you can do.

27:20.040 --> 27:22.713
They say you never missed a shot.
Prove it.

27:34.560 --> 27:35.560
Mmm-hmm.

27:36.520 --> 27:39.751
Now you got one in the chamber.
What you gonna do with it?

27:40.320 --> 27:41.514
Shit!

27:42.280 --> 27:44.077
Give me the word, boss. I'll drop him.

27:44.240 --> 27:45.434
Everybody calm down.

27:45.640 --> 27:47.080
Griggs, tell your men to stand down.

27:47.240 --> 27:48.576
Tell them, "Put it down."

27:48.600 --> 27:49.600
Stand down.

27:49.800 --> 27:52.553
Colonel, for the record, this is exactly
what I was concerned about.

27:52.760 --> 27:53.760
What's for dinner?

27:53.920 --> 27:55.239
Ames, if this man shoots me,

27:55.480 --> 27:57.232
I want you to kill him

27:57.960 --> 27:59.837
and I want you to go clear
my browser history.

28:01.320 --> 28:04.915
See, uh,
the firing pin is filed down, right?

28:05.320 --> 28:08.551
Mag full of dummy rounds.
If I pull the trigger, nothing happens.

28:08.720 --> 28:10.358
You're absolutely right.

28:10.520 --> 28:13.239
Why would we give a loaded weapon
to an infamous hitman?

28:13.400 --> 28:15.914
Go ahead, pull the trigger. Empty it.

28:16.080 --> 28:18.435
Don't empty nothing.
You don't even know this lady.

28:18.600 --> 28:20.352
I've known you, like, nine months.

28:20.520 --> 28:23.040
Remember when I brought you that cookie?
That was a real cookie.

28:25.720 --> 28:27.358
What?

28:28.160 --> 28:29.160
Oops.

28:31.400 --> 28:33.356
Y'all jokers must be crazy.

29:23.000 --> 29:25.275
All right. Now you know
what you're buying.

29:25.440 --> 29:28.671
Let me tell you the price.
First, I want out of here.

29:28.840 --> 29:31.912
Second, I want full custody
of my daughter.

29:32.120 --> 29:35.032
All right? And her mom can have, like,
supervised visits.

29:35.200 --> 29:38.431
But her stank-ass boyfriend can't come.
Darnell can't come.

29:38.600 --> 29:40.192
- Darnell's out.
- He's out.

29:40.360 --> 29:43.193
Third, y'all gonna pay
for my daughter's whole education.

29:43.360 --> 29:46.033
Best schools.
And then I want her to go to college.

29:46.200 --> 29:47.713
Like Harvard. Or Yale.

29:47.880 --> 29:49.677
- So Ivy League.
- Ivy League, yeah.

29:49.840 --> 29:51.416
- One of them big joints, you know?
- Mmm-hmm.

29:51.440 --> 29:54.352
And, uh, if she can't cut it
and her grades start slipping,

29:54.560 --> 29:56.080
I need you to white-people that thing.

29:56.160 --> 29:57.336
- Mmm-hmm.
- You know how y'all do.

29:57.360 --> 29:58.760
- Oh, yeah.
- You know, right? Okay.

29:58.880 --> 30:00.154
Now that's my price.

30:00.360 --> 30:03.511
But I'm concerned 'cause I don't see
nobody writing shit down.

30:03.680 --> 30:06.035
You're in no position to make any demands.

30:06.440 --> 30:09.034
Oh. I'm sorry.
You thought I was talking to you.

30:09.880 --> 30:12.792
No, errand boy. I'm talking to your boss.

30:15.080 --> 30:18.197
That's my price, sweetie.
You know what it is.

30:22.720 --> 30:24.551
You notice these are criminals, hmm?

30:24.760 --> 30:28.070
They're psychotic, antisocial freaks.
It makes no sense.

30:28.240 --> 30:30.120
Let me hit the Tier One units
and I'll build you

30:30.280 --> 30:32.176
a team of pipe hitters who'll
do anything you can dream up.

30:32.200 --> 30:34.350
I mean, you need real soldiers.
Not these scumbags.

30:34.560 --> 30:37.074
In World War Two,
the US Navy made a deal with the mafia

30:37.240 --> 30:38.878
to protect its ships on the waterfront.

30:39.040 --> 30:40.473
This ain't World War Two.

30:40.640 --> 30:41.959
It's World War Three.

30:42.600 --> 30:44.033
What are you really up to?

30:44.200 --> 30:46.873
It's a "need to know", and all you need
to know is you work for me.

30:47.040 --> 30:50.350
That can change with a phone call.
I have friends, too, you know.

30:52.720 --> 30:54.312
There you go. Call.

30:54.840 --> 30:55.960
But without you minding her,

30:56.160 --> 30:59.994
your lady friend stays here strapped
to a board in a drug-induced coma.

31:01.440 --> 31:03.112
They warned me about you.

31:04.800 --> 31:07.075
My dumb ass didn't believe the stories.

31:12.640 --> 31:14.153
Nobody does.

31:23.920 --> 31:25.433
Where is she?

31:25.600 --> 31:28.637
It's complex. This is not just her.

31:28.800 --> 31:30.631
Everybody's disappearing.

31:30.800 --> 31:31.800
There's this new law,

31:31.960 --> 31:34.960
where if you're a bad enough bad guy,
they stamp "terrorist" on your jacket.

31:35.120 --> 31:38.999
They send you to this swamp in Louisiana.
A black site.

31:39.480 --> 31:41.152
That's where she is.

31:42.600 --> 31:44.238
So what are we doing?

31:45.320 --> 31:46.958
Bring the car around.

31:47.720 --> 31:49.790
We're going for a drive.

32:09.680 --> 32:12.433
Lester, Lester!
Hit me one more time!

32:13.200 --> 32:14.349
Come on, man!

32:14.520 --> 32:17.080
You gotta call upstairs and tell them
to float me another 10 K.

32:17.800 --> 32:18.800
- Hey!
- Ow!

32:19.040 --> 32:21.349
- Boss wants to see you.
- You know who I am?

32:26.520 --> 32:28.670
Good job, man. He's killing it.

32:28.880 --> 32:30.108
Come on, man. Why am I here?

32:30.280 --> 32:32.236
All right, yeah, I'm down.
I get it, all right?

32:32.400 --> 32:36.518
I've had a run of bad decks.
Not my fault. All right?

32:36.720 --> 32:38.233
Dude, this is real.

32:38.400 --> 32:41.392
I had to stop these guys from burning
down your house with your kids in it.

32:46.720 --> 32:48.119
But you're lucky.

32:48.320 --> 32:50.276
Maybe. Why do you think so?

32:54.320 --> 32:55.992
Yo, slick. What's up?

32:57.400 --> 32:59.231
Griggs. You are?

32:59.400 --> 33:00.880
You might wanna keep your mouth shut.

33:01.720 --> 33:03.756
Can I go, man?
What the hell is going on, man?

33:03.960 --> 33:05.279
This is crazy.

33:05.480 --> 33:07.038
Blah, blah-blah, blah-blah.

33:07.200 --> 33:09.316
Blah-blah, blah, blah.

33:10.840 --> 33:13.479
All of that chitchat's gonna get ya hurt.

33:13.760 --> 33:14.909
Oh! My God!

33:21.920 --> 33:22.920
Mmm.

33:35.440 --> 33:37.078
I could tell you meant that.

33:37.280 --> 33:40.158
Yeah.

33:41.360 --> 33:43.430
You're gonna be my friend.

34:00.280 --> 34:02.430
Enchantress.

34:13.960 --> 34:16.315
- Log time of death. 1620.
- June?

34:18.600 --> 34:20.199
Let's get her down to the morgue.

34:20.239 --> 34:21.992
June? June?

34:23.199 --> 34:24.315
June.

34:25.639 --> 34:26.708
June.

34:29.719 --> 34:31.072
What did you do?

34:31.920 --> 34:32.920
Shh.

34:33.920 --> 34:35.069
Okay.

35:12.280 --> 35:14.316
Plus, it could be the routing number.

35:15.200 --> 35:17.350
Wanna go for drinks?

36:14.240 --> 36:15.912
Enchantress.

36:18.280 --> 36:19.952
God damn it!

36:21.040 --> 36:23.315
June! June!

36:25.880 --> 36:27.438
June, I'm sorry.

36:32.480 --> 36:33.515
Shh.

36:38.280 --> 36:39.918
She went somewhere.

36:41.320 --> 36:45.791
If you have to choose between her or me,
stop her.

36:45.960 --> 36:47.996
Promise me you'll stop her.

36:52.080 --> 36:53.479
Even if it kills me.

37:20.000 --> 37:22.673
Sir. Sir. You okay?

37:23.320 --> 37:25.675
Can you breathe? Did you take anything?

37:26.840 --> 37:29.354
This is 21.
Send medical to my location.

37:30.320 --> 37:31.548
I'm a physician.

37:31.720 --> 37:33.656
Roger. Bringing medical to your location.

37:33.680 --> 37:35.910
No pulse. Starting compressions.

38:03.440 --> 38:04.668
Sir.

38:04.880 --> 38:07.519
Midway City is under attack.
It's a non-human entity.

38:07.720 --> 38:09.040
I think you know what to do, sir.

38:09.200 --> 38:11.077
Activate Task Force X

38:11.240 --> 38:13.800
and get Amanda Waller
and her whole circus on scene ASAP.

38:13.960 --> 38:14.995
Sir.

38:16.920 --> 38:18.911
We're going live
with Task Force X. Pull 'em.

38:24.640 --> 38:26.596
Prisoner,
get down on your knees, now!

38:26.760 --> 38:28.176
Down on your knees!
Hands in the air! Turn around.

38:28.200 --> 38:29.235
Hands up high!

38:29.400 --> 38:30.879
Hey, I'm cooperating. All right?

38:31.040 --> 38:32.917
- This is me being cool.
- Take her.

38:35.120 --> 38:37.076
Do not fire
that goddamn weapon!

38:38.800 --> 38:39.800
Damn it!

38:41.720 --> 38:43.358
Open the gate!

38:43.520 --> 38:45.112
Everybody, line up for extraction.

38:45.280 --> 38:46.918
Let's go! Let's move, move.

38:47.560 --> 38:49.790
Yeah. Open the door! Let's go!

38:56.520 --> 38:57.555
Hit him!

38:57.720 --> 38:59.200
Hurry up, before he smokes us!

39:00.800 --> 39:01.835
Where you at?

39:02.440 --> 39:03.440
Whoa!

39:08.600 --> 39:09.749
Is that the new guy?

39:16.160 --> 39:17.760
What is that? What is that? Who are you?

39:17.840 --> 39:19.576
- Stand by. Arming device.
- Who are you?

39:19.600 --> 39:21.056
- I don't know who you are.
- Device armed.

39:21.080 --> 39:23.833
Hey! Hey, I'm talking to you.
Hey, I'm talking to you.

39:24.440 --> 39:26.032
Injection successful.

39:26.960 --> 39:28.154
Location verified.

39:29.160 --> 39:32.630
- Anybody who touches me is dead.
- Anybody who...

39:32.920 --> 39:35.639
- Lady. Hey.
- Injection successful.

39:35.800 --> 39:38.189
- Hey! Miss? What was that?
- Location verified.

39:38.360 --> 39:39.360
Next!

39:39.560 --> 39:41.915
Oh, you deaf. You one of them deaf hoes.

39:43.480 --> 39:44.629
Come on.

39:46.120 --> 39:47.400
Shut up, and get it done.

39:49.560 --> 39:50.560
Whee!

39:50.760 --> 39:53.360
Listen, you're being transferred.
I don't know where you're going.

39:53.560 --> 39:54.560
It's from Mr. J.

39:54.800 --> 39:56.296
You gonna tell him I took care of you?

39:56.320 --> 39:58.276
You're so screwed.

39:58.440 --> 40:00.635
What do you mean by that?
What do you mean by that?

40:00.800 --> 40:03.155
Get off me! Get off me!
Harley, what do you mean by that?

40:04.000 --> 40:05.592
Harley!

40:11.640 --> 40:14.632
Hey, I got a delivery.
I have a gift basket for Dr. Van Criss.

40:14.800 --> 40:17.473
You're not on the access list.
I can't let you in. Sorry.

40:17.680 --> 40:20.592
Hey, cool if I leave it with you?
I'm way behind today.

40:21.600 --> 40:23.318
Thank you. You're a good man.

40:35.920 --> 40:37.353
Open up!

40:46.040 --> 40:48.031
Just please, do whatever they say.

40:48.840 --> 40:50.160
Do whatever they say. Just do it.

40:59.840 --> 41:00.920
Hmm.

41:01.760 --> 41:02.909
This looks neat.

41:09.800 --> 41:11.756
Light it up!
Light it up! Light it up!

41:21.280 --> 41:22.838
He's right above us.

41:23.040 --> 41:24.792
This is a mistake. Rick, I can't do this.

41:25.000 --> 41:26.399
- I can't...
- Listen, listen.

41:26.560 --> 41:28.039
There's no other way.

41:28.640 --> 41:30.278
Just get it done.

41:32.400 --> 41:33.913
Just get it done.

41:37.240 --> 41:38.434
Enchantress.

41:39.080 --> 41:41.160
Flag, talk to me.
What's going on down there?

41:42.440 --> 41:43.953
Amanda, she bolted.

41:44.120 --> 41:45.473
Say it again?

41:45.640 --> 41:47.153
She bolted!

41:47.800 --> 41:48.915
Shit!

42:50.440 --> 42:51.475
Go!

43:02.080 --> 43:04.753
Worldwide military is on alert.
Our weapons are ineffective.

43:04.920 --> 43:06.831
I thought this was contained!

43:22.280 --> 43:23.998
This is the worst day of my life!

43:25.520 --> 43:28.796
All evacuees
must report to a FEMA representative.

43:30.680 --> 43:32.511
What's going on in that city?

43:33.160 --> 43:34.718
Those assholes here yet?

43:35.280 --> 43:36.280
Yeah, they're here.

43:38.200 --> 43:40.509
Alpha, Bravo team, on me.

43:43.520 --> 43:45.476
What the hell, Flag?

43:48.040 --> 43:49.189
Unlock 'em.

43:55.680 --> 43:56.680
Mmm!

43:57.400 --> 43:59.550
Hi, boys! Harley Quinn.

43:59.720 --> 44:01.199
How do you do?

44:07.200 --> 44:08.349
Huh?

44:08.920 --> 44:12.037
What was that?
I should kill everyone and escape?

44:13.680 --> 44:16.433
Sorry. It's the voices.

44:17.960 --> 44:20.076
I'm kidding! Jeez!

44:21.120 --> 44:22.872
That's not what they really said.

44:23.040 --> 44:24.553
What do we got here?

44:24.760 --> 44:27.115
Twelve pounds of shit in a 10-pound sack.

44:33.160 --> 44:35.230
Welcome to the party,
Captain Boomerang.

44:38.920 --> 44:41.480
Hey, what's going on, man?

44:41.640 --> 44:42.640
Calm down.

44:42.800 --> 44:44.916
Hey, one minute
I'm playing Mahjong with me nanna,

44:45.080 --> 44:47.355
then this red streak hits me
outta nowhere.

44:47.520 --> 44:50.080
Shut up! You were caught
robbing a diamond exchange.

44:50.240 --> 44:51.434
I was not!

44:53.360 --> 44:57.273
Here comes Slipknot,
the man who can climb anything. Wonderful.

44:57.440 --> 44:59.112
Have a good time, scumbag.

44:59.400 --> 45:00.799
Ooh.

45:01.600 --> 45:02.715
Straighten up.

45:04.880 --> 45:06.279
She had a mouth.

45:06.520 --> 45:08.636
Listen up!

45:09.160 --> 45:10.798
In your necks,

45:11.640 --> 45:14.996
injection you got,
it's a nanite explosive.

45:15.160 --> 45:19.119
It's the size of a rice grain,
but it's powerful as a hand grenade.

45:19.320 --> 45:21.754
You disobey me, you die.

45:23.640 --> 45:25.949
You try to escape, you die.

45:26.160 --> 45:30.631
You otherwise irritate or vex me,
and guess what?

45:31.400 --> 45:32.549
You die.

45:32.720 --> 45:35.598
I'm known to be quite vexing.
I'm just forewarning you.

45:35.760 --> 45:36.795
Lady, shut up!

45:38.000 --> 45:39.194
This is the deal.

45:40.160 --> 45:44.631
You're going somewhere very bad,
to do something that'll get you killed.

45:44.840 --> 45:46.319
But until that happens,

45:47.680 --> 45:48.749
you're my problem.

45:48.960 --> 45:49.960
Mmm.

45:50.760 --> 45:52.910
So was that like a, uh, pep talk?

45:53.080 --> 45:54.308
Yeah. That was a pep talk.

45:54.520 --> 45:55.714
There's your shit.

45:56.560 --> 45:58.869
Grab what you need for a fight.
We're wheels up in 10.

45:59.040 --> 46:01.110
You might wanna work on
your team motivation thing.

46:01.320 --> 46:02.912
- You heard of Phil Jackson?
- Yeah.

46:03.080 --> 46:05.150
He's like the gold standard, okay?

46:05.360 --> 46:07.999
Triangle, bitch. Study.

47:10.880 --> 47:11.880
What?

47:18.640 --> 47:19.640
Won't fit anymore?

47:21.440 --> 47:23.078
Too much junk in the trunk?

47:23.240 --> 47:27.074
Nah. Every time I put this on,
somebody dies.

47:28.240 --> 47:29.240
And?

47:30.320 --> 47:31.912
I like putting it on.

47:32.760 --> 47:33.875
Goody.

47:34.080 --> 47:37.277
Somethin' tells me
a whole lotta people are about to die!

47:37.440 --> 47:38.839
Yeah. It's us.

47:39.040 --> 47:40.240
We're being led to our deaths.

47:40.280 --> 47:41.720
Speak for yourself, mate.

47:42.160 --> 47:44.240
Hey, what's that crap on your face?
Does it wash off?

47:45.920 --> 47:48.798
Hey, if you like a girl, can you light
her cigarette with your pinkie?

47:48.960 --> 47:50.552
Because that would be real classy!

47:50.760 --> 47:53.274
Hey, y'all might
wanna leave old boy alone.

47:53.440 --> 47:56.716
He could torch this whole joint.
Ain't that right, ese?

47:56.880 --> 48:00.953
Ain't got nothing to worry about from me.
I'm cool, homie.

48:01.120 --> 48:02.951
Behold the voice of God.

48:05.960 --> 48:07.936
For those of you
who don't know me officially,

48:07.960 --> 48:09.632
my name is Amanda Waller.

48:10.960 --> 48:13.918
There's an active terrorist event
in Midway City.

48:14.120 --> 48:18.432
I want you to enter the city,
rescue HVT-1, and get them to safety.

48:19.160 --> 48:20.798
I'm sorry. Uh...

48:21.000 --> 48:24.595
For those of us who don't
speak good guy, what is HVT-1?

48:24.760 --> 48:26.680
The only person
that matters in the city,

48:26.880 --> 48:28.472
the one person you can't kill.

48:29.640 --> 48:32.359
Complete the mission,
you get time off your prison sentence.

48:32.520 --> 48:34.272
Fail the mission, you die.

48:34.440 --> 48:37.989
Anything happens to Colonel Flag,
I'll kill every single one of you.

48:39.120 --> 48:40.678
Remember, I'm watching.

48:42.320 --> 48:43.799
I see everything.

48:46.480 --> 48:48.152
There's your pep talk.

48:48.760 --> 48:50.671
Compared to your shit, she killed it.

48:51.520 --> 48:52.669
So that's it?

48:52.840 --> 48:55.718
What, we some kind of Suicide Squad?

48:55.880 --> 48:58.348
I'll notify your next of kin.

48:59.840 --> 49:02.195
Alpha, Bravo team. Mount up!

49:08.040 --> 49:09.440
You're late.

49:35.720 --> 49:38.154
This is Katana. She's got my back.

49:38.320 --> 49:41.232
She can cut all of you in half
with one sword stroke,

49:41.400 --> 49:43.868
just like mowing the lawn.

49:44.080 --> 49:45.991
I would advise not getting killed by her.

49:46.160 --> 49:49.391
Her sword traps the souls of its victims.

49:50.200 --> 49:52.555
Harley Quinn. Nice to meet ya.

49:52.760 --> 49:53.760
Love your perfume.

49:53.920 --> 49:56.309
What is that? The stench of death?

50:00.160 --> 50:03.120
Whoa! Easy, cowgirl.
Ain't that kind of a mission. Have a seat.

50:03.760 --> 50:05.079
She seems nice.

50:24.840 --> 50:25.840
Shh.

50:27.320 --> 50:28.320
Hey.

50:29.800 --> 50:31.280
Is he supposed to be green like that?

50:34.800 --> 50:35.800
Oh!

50:36.120 --> 50:37.473
Party foul!

50:38.280 --> 50:39.713
Not cool.

50:52.640 --> 50:54.437
Ooh. Look at the pretty lights!

50:55.800 --> 50:57.677
Are you guys seeing this?

50:59.040 --> 51:00.040
What happened?

51:02.120 --> 51:03.633
Terror attack.

51:03.800 --> 51:07.031
Dirty bombs, bad guys
shooting up the place with AKs.

51:07.200 --> 51:09.156
You know, usual shit.

51:09.320 --> 51:10.320
Right.

51:11.320 --> 51:13.151
Yeah, you're a bad liar.

51:14.160 --> 51:15.336
I don't know if they told you,

51:15.360 --> 51:18.477
but I'm a hitman. I'm not a fireman.
I don't save people.

51:18.640 --> 51:20.153
Anything for a dollar, right?

51:20.800 --> 51:23.633
You know the dark places, too.
Don't act like you don't.

51:23.800 --> 51:25.677
I'm a soldier!

51:25.840 --> 51:28.673
And you're a serial killer
who takes credit cards.

51:28.840 --> 51:33.152
When the shooting starts,
and it will, you'll cut and run.

51:47.640 --> 51:49.198
Six-one is going down.

51:49.360 --> 51:51.237
Six-one is going down hard.

52:05.520 --> 52:07.238
Stand by. Drop the ramp.

52:16.240 --> 52:18.151
Whoo! What a ride!

52:18.440 --> 52:20.476
We're okay. We're okay.
Assets are undamaged.

52:39.080 --> 52:41.071
- Mind games.
- What's that?

52:41.240 --> 52:43.276
All this bomb in the neck crap.

52:44.160 --> 52:45.229
That ain't real, mate.

52:45.880 --> 52:48.120
See, they're trying to trap us
with our own minds, right?

52:48.200 --> 52:51.795
But you look around, we're free, brah.

52:51.960 --> 52:52.960
How do you know this?

52:53.120 --> 52:55.270
Just trust me. I know, all right?
It's a con.

52:55.480 --> 52:58.438
Now I'm going,
because I got a life to live.

52:58.600 --> 53:00.591
Question is, are you coming?

53:04.720 --> 53:06.676
Yeah. Smart!

53:28.440 --> 53:29.440
Hold your fire.

53:32.440 --> 53:34.192
Sorry. It's what I do.

53:45.520 --> 53:46.520
Damn it.

53:48.440 --> 53:50.749
Now that's a killer app!

53:50.920 --> 53:52.478
Okay. You wanna keep playing

53:52.640 --> 53:55.256
the Hollywood Squares version
of "I'll Blow Your Freaking Head Off"?

53:55.280 --> 53:56.280
Are you next?

53:57.160 --> 53:58.434
You tripping, homie.

53:59.280 --> 54:00.918
You next, Deadshot?

54:03.960 --> 54:05.029
You just threatened me?

54:05.200 --> 54:06.599
Oh, yeah.

54:06.800 --> 54:08.313
He just threatened me.

54:12.040 --> 54:13.439
Move.

54:13.640 --> 54:15.198
You got a boyfriend?

54:18.960 --> 54:20.518
All right, I'm gonna kill him.

54:20.680 --> 54:21.816
Well, you better make it quick

54:21.840 --> 54:23.560
'cause he's gonna kill
all of us one by one.

54:24.360 --> 54:26.920
I'm gonna drop him, the sword lady,
five or seven of these SEALs.

54:27.040 --> 54:29.076
After that, I'm gonna need
some help. You down?

54:29.280 --> 54:31.794
Always. What about the shit in our necks?

54:31.960 --> 54:34.633
Your friend's gonna
help us out with that, right?

54:37.840 --> 54:39.910
You're my friend, too.

54:41.320 --> 54:44.517
Stay evil, doll face. Spread the word.

54:56.840 --> 54:57.840
So...

54:58.000 --> 55:00.150
I'm thinking if we move together,

55:00.320 --> 55:03.118
we can kill all these guys
and go our separate ways.

55:03.400 --> 55:04.674
- Yeah?
- Sounds good.

55:12.680 --> 55:14.159
Spread the word.

55:16.400 --> 55:17.799
Psst. Oi. Oi.

55:20.720 --> 55:22.119
We need your help, man.

55:22.520 --> 55:23.953
When the time's right,

55:24.240 --> 55:25.673
you hit Flag with a fireball.

55:26.320 --> 55:29.551
He'll be too busy burning to death
to have a go at us with his phone of doom.

55:30.120 --> 55:31.120
Then what?

55:31.840 --> 55:33.319
Then we get out of here.

55:34.720 --> 55:35.789
And do what?

55:36.160 --> 55:38.280
What are you,
bloody Socrates, with all the questions?

55:38.320 --> 55:39.435
Freedom, man.

55:40.240 --> 55:41.878
Freedom! You remember that, don't you?

55:43.240 --> 55:44.760
We're criminals. You know that, right?

55:44.960 --> 55:46.359
Yeah. It's great.

55:46.680 --> 55:47.908
Come on, do the bastard.

55:50.520 --> 55:51.589
Hey, be careful.

55:52.080 --> 55:53.115
He eats people.

55:53.280 --> 55:54.599
Sorry, Mother Superior, what?

55:55.080 --> 55:56.718
He eats people for reals, homie.

55:56.920 --> 55:57.920
He's a cannibal.

55:58.400 --> 55:59.628
Oh.

56:03.960 --> 56:05.075
No.

56:21.120 --> 56:22.640
What did you say to him?

56:22.800 --> 56:24.756
Nothing. Just having a laugh.

56:25.480 --> 56:26.754
No worries.

56:33.840 --> 56:36.160
I'm standing by for follow on tac team.

56:46.640 --> 56:49.438
C2, what is the operational load
of the PLS?

56:49.640 --> 56:51.039
Boss, we got people up here.

56:52.160 --> 56:53.832
I'm on my way.

57:06.120 --> 57:07.120
Shit.

57:07.280 --> 57:09.236
Amanda, we have hostiles up ahead.

57:09.440 --> 57:11.158
Flag, get out of there.

57:11.360 --> 57:13.669
We're not here to fight them.
We know that doesn't work.

57:13.840 --> 57:15.558
Copy that.

57:15.720 --> 57:16.994
We're diverting.

57:17.200 --> 57:19.714
Bump out second squad two blocks east.

57:19.880 --> 57:22.519
We'll pass through you, continue north.

57:22.680 --> 57:24.216
Take Bravo two blocks east.

57:24.240 --> 57:26.176
We'll leapfrog through you
once you're in position.

57:26.200 --> 57:27.200
Copy that.

57:34.520 --> 57:38.832
Hey. I like these odds, mate.
You just say the word.

57:39.000 --> 57:40.000
Yeah.

57:40.800 --> 57:41.915
Come on.

57:42.360 --> 57:43.360
Yeah, uh...

57:43.560 --> 57:44.879
Hold that thought.

57:54.120 --> 57:56.429
Rick, why do they look like that?

57:56.600 --> 57:58.272
Just stay cool.

58:10.120 --> 58:11.155
The hell are they?

58:12.080 --> 58:14.071
You cut and run, I'll blow your head off.

58:26.120 --> 58:27.120
Hit them!

58:37.400 --> 58:38.400
Huh.

59:24.080 --> 59:25.080
Hey.

59:35.120 --> 59:36.120
Ha!

59:51.000 --> 59:52.000
Get off me!

59:56.280 --> 59:57.395
Get off me! Son of a...

01:00:02.080 --> 01:00:03.115
Flag!

01:00:04.680 --> 01:00:05.976
- Good riddance.
- Harley!

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:07.353
He dies, we die.

01:00:19.720 --> 01:00:21.073
- Thanks.
- Shut up.

01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:24.269
Backblast, clear!

01:01:13.600 --> 01:01:14.715
Pinky.

01:01:18.800 --> 01:01:20.916
That's how I cut and run.

01:01:28.760 --> 01:01:30.193
Hey.

01:01:30.360 --> 01:01:31.360
Hey, come on.

01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:33.750
What? I saw it move.

01:01:34.720 --> 01:01:37.154
See? It flinched. I think.

01:01:38.080 --> 01:01:39.479
Hey, you were some help, princess.

01:01:40.720 --> 01:01:41.914
It's better this way.

01:01:42.520 --> 01:01:43.520
Trust me.

01:01:43.720 --> 01:01:45.438
Oh, yeah, you're the fire bloke, eh?

01:01:45.600 --> 01:01:47.795
- Yeah, I was. Yeah.
- Right. Yeah. Hey.

01:01:49.120 --> 01:01:50.269
Well, looky here.

01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:51.998
Whoo! It's fire.

01:01:52.240 --> 01:01:53.240
Whoo!

01:01:55.120 --> 01:01:57.236
The brief said terrorists.

01:01:57.840 --> 01:01:58.976
You wanna start explaining this?

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:00.680
If I told you, would you believe me?

01:02:02.160 --> 01:02:03.718
- What are they?
- I don't know.

01:02:03.880 --> 01:02:05.359
That's bullshit.

01:02:05.960 --> 01:02:08.349
Thing has on a $3,000 watch.

01:02:09.800 --> 01:02:11.119
Is that a person?

01:02:11.760 --> 01:02:12.760
It was.

01:02:13.600 --> 01:02:14.999
Now it's not.

01:02:16.320 --> 01:02:17.355
Hey, don't!

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:19.194
What?

01:02:19.360 --> 01:02:20.634
We got a job to do.

01:02:23.840 --> 01:02:24.840
We're moving.

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:29.831
Get your boys moving.

01:02:32.320 --> 01:02:33.673
Let's go.

01:02:42.360 --> 01:02:44.396
Waller,
we're moving on the objective.

01:02:44.560 --> 01:02:46.136
We lost contact with Bravo.
You got a visual?

01:02:46.160 --> 01:02:47.195
Stand by.

01:02:47.360 --> 01:02:49.669
- Anything on the other squad?
- No, ma'am.

01:02:49.840 --> 01:02:52.195
Go-7, I need your sensors
on those coordinates.

01:02:52.360 --> 01:02:53.360
Flag, it's a negative.

01:02:53.520 --> 01:02:56.478
They were engaged when you were,
but we lost them.

01:03:33.360 --> 01:03:34.429
Seriously?

01:03:34.600 --> 01:03:36.909
The hell is wrong with you people?

01:03:37.120 --> 01:03:40.078
We're bad guys. It's what we do.

01:03:59.240 --> 01:04:01.231
Hey, Deadshot. I've been thinking.

01:04:01.560 --> 01:04:04.597
If we don't come together,
no one's walking out of here alive.

01:04:06.240 --> 01:04:07.275
Hmm.

01:04:07.480 --> 01:04:08.674
And?

01:04:09.120 --> 01:04:11.236
These people respect you.
You got influence.

01:04:12.320 --> 01:04:14.117
All right. What's your play right now?

01:04:14.280 --> 01:04:15.793
You're a man of your word, right?

01:04:18.840 --> 01:04:20.114
I want my mission.

01:04:20.600 --> 01:04:22.431
You want your life and your kid back.

01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:28.230
You help me keep this Mardi Gras parade
in line and I'll hook you up.

01:04:30.120 --> 01:04:32.076
Waller is the puppet master.

01:04:32.480 --> 01:04:34.000
You ain't got shit to hook me up with.

01:04:34.160 --> 01:04:35.798
I got plenty of my own strings to pull.

01:04:36.120 --> 01:04:37.856
You just get them
to the top of that target building

01:04:37.880 --> 01:04:39.791
and get my rescuee
on that extraction helo.

01:04:40.480 --> 01:04:41.936
And you're gonna make sure I get paid?

01:04:41.960 --> 01:04:43.109
And you get paid.

01:04:44.280 --> 01:04:45.960
You get paid,
and you get your fresh start.

01:04:53.200 --> 01:04:54.200
Take a knee.

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:01.560
Our body's at the top of that building.

01:05:01.680 --> 01:05:02.999
We get up there,

01:05:03.160 --> 01:05:04.920
pull them out of the vault
they're hiding in.

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:06.752
Helos extract us off the roof.

01:05:06.960 --> 01:05:08.518
- It's Miller time.
- Check.

01:05:09.720 --> 01:05:11.915
Flag, who's up there?

01:05:12.080 --> 01:05:13.296
That's none of your concern.

01:05:13.320 --> 01:05:15.216
- Do you know who's up there?
- No.

01:05:15.240 --> 01:05:16.468
Is it the President?

01:05:16.680 --> 01:05:17.840
It's not the President.

01:05:29.880 --> 01:05:31.154
Argh!

01:05:52.280 --> 01:05:53.349
Oh, you!

01:05:53.520 --> 01:05:55.476
You're not leaving me.
You're not leaving me!

01:05:55.680 --> 01:05:57.875
You're a pain in the ass.

01:06:00.840 --> 01:06:03.115
I have done everything you said.

01:06:03.280 --> 01:06:06.511
Every test, every trial, every initiation.

01:06:06.680 --> 01:06:09.478
I have proved I love you. Just accept it.

01:06:09.640 --> 01:06:11.153
Got it, got it, got it, got it.

01:06:11.520 --> 01:06:15.399
I am not someone who is loved.

01:06:16.440 --> 01:06:18.829
I'm an idea.

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.230
A state of mind.

01:06:21.400 --> 01:06:24.995
I execute my will according to my plan.

01:06:25.160 --> 01:06:28.118
And you, Doctor...

01:06:28.800 --> 01:06:30.096
Are not part of my plan.

01:06:30.120 --> 01:06:33.749
Just let me in. I promise...
Let me in! I promise I won't hurt you.

01:06:33.920 --> 01:06:35.239
A promise-promise?

01:06:35.400 --> 01:06:36.833
Hey, dickface!

01:06:37.560 --> 01:06:39.755
Mind screaming at your bitch
somewhere else?

01:06:41.600 --> 01:06:44.114
I was gonna say,
"I wouldn't do that if I were you."

01:06:48.240 --> 01:06:49.753
Don't hurt me.

01:06:50.400 --> 01:06:51.435
I'll be your friend.

01:06:55.480 --> 01:06:58.040
Do it. Do it, do it, do it.

01:06:58.240 --> 01:07:01.755
My heart scares you, and a gun doesn't?

01:07:01.920 --> 01:07:02.989
Do it!

01:07:09.360 --> 01:07:12.955
If you weren't so crazy,
I'd think you were insane.

01:07:14.600 --> 01:07:16.830
Go away.

01:07:20.040 --> 01:07:21.758
Harley, you coming?

01:07:35.880 --> 01:07:37.472
Why do you eat people?

01:07:41.600 --> 01:07:43.795
Gives me their power.

01:07:44.720 --> 01:07:45.755
Would you like to eat me?

01:07:47.640 --> 01:07:48.868
Hell, no.

01:07:49.160 --> 01:07:50.309
Aw, why not?

01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:52.791
I don't want your crazy.

01:07:54.520 --> 01:07:56.636
Says the guy who lives in a sewer.

01:07:56.840 --> 01:07:58.831
At least I know it's a sewer.

01:07:59.560 --> 01:08:01.278
Oh, I get it.

01:08:01.680 --> 01:08:03.830
'Cause like, this is a sewer, too,

01:08:04.080 --> 01:08:06.310
only with
nice shops and restaurants, right?

01:08:06.480 --> 01:08:08.994
- Mmm.
- You hate mankind much?

01:08:10.520 --> 01:08:11.669
Let me guess.

01:08:12.840 --> 01:08:16.354
Mommy didn't take you to Chuck E. Cheese
on your sixth birthday.

01:08:17.439 --> 01:08:19.240
I can recommend a good therapist.

01:08:21.960 --> 01:08:22.960
Why?

01:08:23.200 --> 01:08:24.553
Because I'm bored.

01:08:24.720 --> 01:08:28.759
I need a victim,
a mind to pry apart and spit in.

01:08:28.920 --> 01:08:31.194
Leave it, mate.
She's a rabbit hole. Don't fall in.

01:08:36.319 --> 01:08:38.197
And here's one now.

01:08:39.520 --> 01:08:41.750
Japanese, female.

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:46.152
Mid-20s, 5'5", good health, athletic.

01:08:46.439 --> 01:08:47.872
And...

01:08:49.560 --> 01:08:50.959
An only child.

01:08:51.680 --> 01:08:54.752
With deep-seated father issues.

01:08:56.120 --> 01:08:59.874
Daddy wanted a son,
so she has to hide behind a mask.

01:09:04.800 --> 01:09:06.596
I am not

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:09.194
hiding.

01:09:10.760 --> 01:09:12.193
Now, that was gangster.

01:09:12.880 --> 01:09:14.029
Harley.

01:09:14.200 --> 01:09:16.055
Why don't you
stop acting like a drunken stripper?

01:09:16.080 --> 01:09:18.040
You wanna tell me
what the hell is going on, then?

01:09:18.080 --> 01:09:19.080
'Cause...

01:09:19.279 --> 01:09:21.475
I smell a rat.

01:09:23.520 --> 01:09:25.475
If they don't blow our heads off,

01:09:25.800 --> 01:09:27.711
we'll have to
fight our way out of this city.

01:09:28.680 --> 01:09:31.069
I need you to
play nice with the other children.

01:09:31.359 --> 01:09:34.352
And quietly return to my cage.

01:09:35.240 --> 01:09:36.559
Sure, okay.

01:09:37.240 --> 01:09:40.437
Hey, that's okay, sellout.
I get it. I get it.

01:09:40.720 --> 01:09:42.870
I know how the world works, okay?

01:09:43.479 --> 01:09:45.595
And when it comes to the heart,

01:09:46.760 --> 01:09:48.478
everyone for themselves, right?

01:10:08.320 --> 01:10:09.355
Waller?

01:10:10.240 --> 01:10:13.073
We're about to enter the building.
Get that chopper ready.

01:10:17.160 --> 01:10:18.680
What do you say we get this over with?

01:10:18.800 --> 01:10:21.155
What the hell? Deadshot. Fall back.

01:10:27.320 --> 01:10:28.833
You mind if we tag along?

01:10:42.320 --> 01:10:44.436
Whoo! Looks like we have
a spot of luck, eh?

01:10:45.640 --> 01:10:47.676
Be a walk in the park.

01:10:47.840 --> 01:10:49.432
Easy peasy.

01:10:49.640 --> 01:10:51.312
Don't make me shoot you.

01:10:56.840 --> 01:10:58.353
God damn it. Harley!

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:00.149
Go, go, go, go!

01:11:48.240 --> 01:11:49.355
Hey, guys!

01:11:55.920 --> 01:11:57.239
Come on. Let's go.

01:12:06.600 --> 01:12:10.070
Ma'am. I got motion detectors going off
on the secure floors.

01:12:13.120 --> 01:12:15.031
- Flag, they're all around you.
- Hold.

01:12:15.200 --> 01:12:17.191
Use extreme caution.

01:12:18.960 --> 01:12:20.439
I don't like this, Flag.

01:12:22.080 --> 01:12:23.798
I don't like it either.

01:12:28.280 --> 01:12:29.280
Pussy.

01:12:29.440 --> 01:12:31.556
I will knock your ass out.

01:12:31.720 --> 01:12:33.073
I do not care that you're a girl.

01:13:23.720 --> 01:13:25.119
They're after Flag again.

01:13:26.200 --> 01:13:27.758
Son of a bitch. Get off me.

01:13:32.240 --> 01:13:33.992
Circle up. Circle around him.

01:13:39.680 --> 01:13:41.750
- Let me fight!
- You die, we die.

01:13:44.920 --> 01:13:46.831
Clear! Everyone move out!

01:14:01.360 --> 01:14:03.176
- Where you been, homie?
- This ain't my fight!

01:14:03.200 --> 01:14:05.953
You know what? You don't stand for shit.
You ain't about shit!

01:14:06.120 --> 01:14:07.240
Don't touch me, man!

01:14:07.360 --> 01:14:08.656
Don't touch you? What you gonna do?

01:14:08.680 --> 01:14:10.656
- Don't touch me!
- I'm touching you! I'm touching you!

01:14:10.680 --> 01:14:12.520
- Do something. Do something!
- Don't touch me!

01:14:12.680 --> 01:14:14.136
- You wanna see something?
- Oh, yeah, I wanna see...

01:14:14.160 --> 01:14:16.360
- You wanna see something?
- Yes, I wanna see something.

01:14:40.240 --> 01:14:42.151
I was just trying to get you there.

01:14:43.560 --> 01:14:44.879
Phil Jackson. We good, right?

01:14:47.240 --> 01:14:49.879
I knew you'd come through.

01:14:50.400 --> 01:14:51.913
That shit crazy.

01:15:02.040 --> 01:15:03.234
Clear.

01:15:16.560 --> 01:15:18.596
I gotta work on my cardio.

01:15:28.600 --> 01:15:30.272
Question.

01:15:32.680 --> 01:15:34.398
Would you die for me?

01:15:36.640 --> 01:15:37.640
Yes.

01:15:37.840 --> 01:15:39.398
That's too easy.

01:15:40.400 --> 01:15:41.879
Would you...

01:15:44.360 --> 01:15:46.396
Would you live for me?

01:15:48.360 --> 01:15:49.360
Mmm?

01:15:49.600 --> 01:15:50.794
Yes.

01:15:51.560 --> 01:15:53.118
Careful.

01:15:53.280 --> 01:15:57.956
Do not say this oath thoughtlessly.

01:15:59.960 --> 01:16:03.157
Desire becomes surrender.
Surrender becomes power.

01:16:07.160 --> 01:16:08.388
Do you want this?

01:16:09.720 --> 01:16:10.720
I do.

01:16:10.920 --> 01:16:12.273
Say it.

01:16:12.440 --> 01:16:15.159
Say it. Say it.

01:16:15.320 --> 01:16:17.834
Pretty, pretty, pretty...

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:19.115
Please.

01:16:20.280 --> 01:16:21.838
Aw! God, you're so...

01:16:22.440 --> 01:16:23.475
Good.

01:17:29.160 --> 01:17:30.718
Whoa!

01:17:31.160 --> 01:17:32.752
Relax. Just me.

01:17:36.920 --> 01:17:38.512
You ever been in love?

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:42.558
Nah. Never.

01:17:42.760 --> 01:17:44.034
Bullshit.

01:17:44.200 --> 01:17:46.031
You don't kill as many people
as I've killed

01:17:46.200 --> 01:17:49.829
and still sleep like a kitten
if you feel shit like love.

01:17:52.560 --> 01:17:54.357
Another textbook sociopath.

01:17:58.560 --> 01:18:00.869
Clear.

01:18:02.080 --> 01:18:03.274
All right, secure the roof.

01:18:03.440 --> 01:18:06.000
Sweep for shooters
so we can bring in our aviation assets.

01:18:06.200 --> 01:18:07.235
Going to the roof.

01:18:14.080 --> 01:18:15.672
Oh. Wait here.

01:18:16.320 --> 01:18:17.320
Please.

01:18:17.520 --> 01:18:20.080
I don't wanna give this dude
a heart attack. Okay?

01:18:21.080 --> 01:18:22.957
Aw, he's embarrassed of us!

01:18:23.120 --> 01:18:24.348
Hey, Flag.

01:18:24.520 --> 01:18:26.829
This dude better cure cancer
after all of this shit.

01:18:34.040 --> 01:18:36.190
You ready? Let's go.

01:18:37.040 --> 01:18:39.110
You wouldn't have made it without them.

01:18:39.280 --> 01:18:42.317
We got lucky. I don't do luck.
I do planning and precision.

01:18:42.480 --> 01:18:44.835
Admit it, Rick. I was right.

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.639
Yeah, I told you to get on the damn truck.
Why'd you stay?

01:18:47.800 --> 01:18:49.552
I was studying your girlfriend.

01:18:49.720 --> 01:18:53.395
She takes an average person,
a yoga mom, an elderly retiree,

01:18:53.560 --> 01:18:56.480
and she turns them into a soldier
who can take a headshot and still fight.

01:18:57.160 --> 01:18:58.798
It's an instant army.

01:18:59.800 --> 01:19:01.028
How'd she do it, Flag?

01:19:01.760 --> 01:19:05.230
How'd she game the system
with you watching her every move?

01:19:08.160 --> 01:19:09.832
I'll accept the consequences.

01:19:10.440 --> 01:19:12.396
I am your consequence.

01:19:12.600 --> 01:19:14.160
You might need to be careful.

01:19:14.680 --> 01:19:16.750
They think we're rescuing Nelson Mandela.

01:19:16.920 --> 01:19:18.433
I can take care of myself.

01:19:18.600 --> 01:19:19.800
Shut it down, wipe the drives.

01:19:19.960 --> 01:19:21.440
- Yes, ma'am.
- Copy that.

01:19:22.840 --> 01:19:25.200
Uh, hey, man. I know you can't hear me
'cause you're trapped

01:19:25.360 --> 01:19:27.874
in your temple of soldierly
self-righteousness,

01:19:28.040 --> 01:19:31.476
but a two-faced dude like you
wouldn't survive a second on the street.

01:19:31.640 --> 01:19:33.517
Oh, says the guy
who shoots people for money.

01:19:33.680 --> 01:19:34.880
My cards is on the table, man.

01:19:35.040 --> 01:19:36.439
It got done, didn't it?

01:19:42.280 --> 01:19:46.592
Damn. That is just a mean lady.

01:19:47.640 --> 01:19:49.232
Yeah. You get used to it.

01:19:51.200 --> 01:19:53.031
And I'm the bad guy?

01:19:57.040 --> 01:19:58.519
That's gangsta.

01:19:59.680 --> 01:20:00.715
What?

01:20:00.880 --> 01:20:02.760
They weren't cleared for any of this.
Any of it.

01:20:02.840 --> 01:20:05.832
Hey, I'm not judging.
I've buried a lot of mistakes, too.

01:20:16.360 --> 01:20:17.554
No way.

01:20:27.640 --> 01:20:29.232
Let's go home.

01:20:29.400 --> 01:20:30.958
Yeah, let's go home.

01:20:31.720 --> 01:20:34.792
That sounds good.
You guys wanna go home? Hmm?

01:20:34.960 --> 01:20:36.951
Or you wanna go back to prison?

01:20:37.120 --> 01:20:38.599
I'm not going back to prison.

01:20:38.760 --> 01:20:41.513
What I'm saying is we kill the pair of 'em
now before they kill us.

01:20:42.960 --> 01:20:44.757
I got this.

01:20:47.720 --> 01:20:49.551
You all made it this far.

01:20:50.600 --> 01:20:53.558
Don't get high-spirited on me
and ruin a good thing.

01:21:10.240 --> 01:21:11.798
I like her.

01:21:15.520 --> 01:21:17.715
Savior One-Zero,
this is Ground Element.

01:21:21.280 --> 01:21:24.113
Savior One-Zero, how copy?

01:21:25.320 --> 01:21:27.595
Savior One-Zero, the LZ's clear.

01:21:33.400 --> 01:21:34.680
Boss, they're not talking to me.

01:21:36.880 --> 01:21:37.915
Our bird's been jacked.

01:21:39.720 --> 01:21:40.720
Light it up!

01:22:07.080 --> 01:22:08.877
What? I got a hickey or something?

01:22:09.040 --> 01:22:11.031
Professor,
could you pick up the pace?

01:22:23.360 --> 01:22:24.395
Harley!

01:22:27.760 --> 01:22:29.034
Hello, baby.

01:22:31.480 --> 01:22:32.480
Kill her!

01:22:34.240 --> 01:22:36.231
Her nanite's disarmed!

01:22:38.720 --> 01:22:39.914
Come on, baby.

01:22:55.480 --> 01:22:56.515
Deadshot,

01:22:57.560 --> 01:22:59.391
shoot that woman right now!

01:22:59.560 --> 01:23:01.437
She ain't do shit to me.

01:23:01.600 --> 01:23:03.670
You're a hitman, right?

01:23:03.840 --> 01:23:05.068
I got a contract.

01:23:05.240 --> 01:23:09.119
Kill Harley Quinn.
Do it for your freedom and your kid.

01:23:11.160 --> 01:23:12.912
Now she dead.

01:23:52.520 --> 01:23:53.669
I missed.

01:23:58.600 --> 01:23:59.600
Good one, mate.

01:24:00.400 --> 01:24:01.879
It's Waller.

01:24:02.080 --> 01:24:05.470
Savior One-Zero's been hijacked.
Shoot it down.

01:24:05.680 --> 01:24:07.636
Roger that, ma'am. Going hot.

01:24:15.880 --> 01:24:16.915
Puddin'!

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:23.956
You got all dressed up for me?

01:24:24.160 --> 01:24:26.628
Oh, you know I'd do anything for you.

01:24:26.800 --> 01:24:29.314
By the way,
I've got some grape soda on ice,

01:24:29.480 --> 01:24:30.754
and a bear skin rug waiting.

01:24:30.960 --> 01:24:31.960
Yeah?

01:24:32.440 --> 01:24:33.634
Boss, we got a problem!

01:24:34.040 --> 01:24:35.189
Huh?

01:24:39.720 --> 01:24:42.553
- This bird is baked.
- No.

01:24:44.360 --> 01:24:46.669
Okay, honey. It's me and you.

01:24:46.840 --> 01:24:48.068
Let's do it.

01:25:14.760 --> 01:25:16.159
Target destroyed, ma'am.

01:25:16.320 --> 01:25:18.356
Thank you. Now get me off this roof.

01:25:19.360 --> 01:25:20.918
Yes, ma'am. We are inbound.

01:25:24.360 --> 01:25:26.396
The Joker and Harley Quinn are no more.

01:25:31.760 --> 01:25:32.954
You couldn't save her.

01:25:37.440 --> 01:25:38.919
Roger. I see ya.

01:25:42.280 --> 01:25:43.280
Watch your step, ma'am.

01:25:45.720 --> 01:25:48.518
Stand by. I'll send another helo!

01:26:49.200 --> 01:26:51.236
Waller's down.

01:26:51.400 --> 01:26:52.400
It's over.

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:56.515
Ops just confirmed. She's down. 1 k west.

01:26:59.120 --> 01:27:00.758
Let's go get her.

01:27:06.280 --> 01:27:07.679
The mission's not over.

01:27:07.840 --> 01:27:11.037
Nah. It is for me. We had a deal.

01:27:11.360 --> 01:27:13.351
Without Waller, you got nothing.

01:27:59.240 --> 01:28:02.198
Hey, guys. I'm back!

01:28:03.520 --> 01:28:05.909
I missed you all so much.

01:28:06.800 --> 01:28:09.473
We're glad you could make it.

01:28:23.240 --> 01:28:25.231
Hey, craziness.

01:29:11.320 --> 01:29:14.949
With my heart returned,
I can finish my weapon.

01:29:15.560 --> 01:29:19.314
Now tell me how to destroy your armies.

01:29:19.520 --> 01:29:21.397
Do your worst, bitch!

01:29:49.920 --> 01:29:50.960
So let me guess.

01:29:52.160 --> 01:29:55.152
We're going to
the swirling ring of trash in the sky.

01:29:55.640 --> 01:29:57.312
You know, 'cause why wouldn't we?

01:29:59.960 --> 01:30:01.837
When does this end, Flag?

01:30:02.040 --> 01:30:03.553
Load up. We're in for a fight.

01:30:28.680 --> 01:30:31.956
You tell everybody everything.

01:30:32.560 --> 01:30:34.869
Or me and you gonna go right now.

01:30:41.200 --> 01:30:42.200
Three days ago,

01:30:42.360 --> 01:30:45.158
a non-human entity appeared
in the subway station.

01:30:46.640 --> 01:30:48.551
Waller, we're almost there.

01:30:48.720 --> 01:30:52.190
So Waller sent me and a woman
with incredible abilities.

01:30:52.360 --> 01:30:54.191
Enchantress.

01:30:55.200 --> 01:30:56.713
A witch.

01:30:57.760 --> 01:31:00.991
See, nobody could get near this thing,
but the witch could.

01:31:03.080 --> 01:31:04.308
Bomb's ready.

01:31:04.520 --> 01:31:06.078
Set for two seconds.

01:31:06.240 --> 01:31:07.760
You just press the button and drop it.

01:31:11.720 --> 01:31:14.632
Needless to say,
the whole thing was a bad idea.

01:31:14.800 --> 01:31:15.949
She bolted!

01:31:16.120 --> 01:31:17.599
Shit!

01:31:25.480 --> 01:31:28.233
And that's how she escaped from Waller.

01:31:30.600 --> 01:31:31.999
So now you know.

01:31:33.480 --> 01:31:35.311
You can just kill me right now,

01:31:36.760 --> 01:31:38.273
but I'm going to have a drink.

01:31:38.880 --> 01:31:40.279
Hey, Deadshot, I need your help.

01:31:40.880 --> 01:31:43.872
No, sir. You need a miracle.

01:32:16.280 --> 01:32:18.032
What ya having, K.C.?

01:32:19.280 --> 01:32:21.032
Bloody Mary, right?

01:32:22.920 --> 01:32:24.990
Drink dulls the mind.

01:32:25.680 --> 01:32:27.955
K.C., it's the end of the world.

01:32:28.320 --> 01:32:29.878
Have a drink with us.

01:32:30.920 --> 01:32:31.955
Beer.

01:32:32.280 --> 01:32:34.430
There he is. Give the man a beer.

01:32:36.680 --> 01:32:38.159
How about you, hot stuff?

01:32:40.920 --> 01:32:41.955
Water.

01:32:42.240 --> 01:32:43.798
That's a good idea, honey.

01:32:46.400 --> 01:32:47.515
Ninja?

01:32:48.120 --> 01:32:49.120
You want some sake?

01:32:49.960 --> 01:32:50.995
Whiskey.

01:32:51.360 --> 01:32:52.429
Whiskey.

01:32:53.240 --> 01:32:54.309
Okay.

01:32:56.840 --> 01:32:57.840
What am I, 12?

01:33:04.840 --> 01:33:07.991
Here's to honor among thieves.

01:33:08.600 --> 01:33:10.079
I'm not a thief.

01:33:11.960 --> 01:33:13.632
Oh. She's not a thief.

01:33:20.600 --> 01:33:23.672
I actually prefer to think of myself
as an asset relocation specialist.

01:33:24.200 --> 01:33:25.519
Mmm.

01:33:25.960 --> 01:33:28.349
Well, we almost pulled it off

01:33:28.520 --> 01:33:31.239
despite what everybody thought.

01:33:32.160 --> 01:33:34.310
We weren't picked to succeed.
You know that, right?

01:33:35.360 --> 01:33:36.839
We were all chosen to fail.

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:38.433
Yeah, I know that.

01:33:38.600 --> 01:33:41.797
Worst part of it is, they're going to
blame us for the whole thing.

01:33:42.240 --> 01:33:44.595
And they can't have people
knowing the truth.

01:33:45.200 --> 01:33:46.792
We're the patsies.

01:33:46.960 --> 01:33:48.188
The cover-up.

01:33:49.360 --> 01:33:51.715
Don't forget, we're the bad guys.

01:33:56.960 --> 01:34:00.794
So you gonna tell us now
what your "big deal" with Flag was?

01:34:00.960 --> 01:34:04.032
Same thing Waller offered me, to kill you.

01:34:04.480 --> 01:34:06.277
The chance to be a father.

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:09.150
Chance at a life outside the shadows.

01:34:11.160 --> 01:34:12.673
I trusted Flag.

01:34:13.240 --> 01:34:15.356
Flag had you
chasing a carrot on a stick, homie.

01:34:15.560 --> 01:34:16.880
You don't... You don't know that?

01:34:17.400 --> 01:34:18.549
I love this guy.

01:34:18.920 --> 01:34:20.148
You played yourself, dawg.

01:34:20.560 --> 01:34:22.198
Bitch, I'm having a drink.

01:34:22.760 --> 01:34:25.228
I'm breathing fresh air.

01:34:25.600 --> 01:34:26.794
And, uh,

01:34:26.960 --> 01:34:29.110
for two sweet seconds...

01:34:30.160 --> 01:34:31.878
I had hope.

01:34:32.440 --> 01:34:34.112
You had hope, huh?

01:34:35.840 --> 01:34:38.070
Hope don't stop
the wheel from turning, my brother.

01:34:38.360 --> 01:34:40.032
Hmm. You preaching?

01:34:40.240 --> 01:34:42.071
It's coming back around for you.

01:34:42.600 --> 01:34:45.273
How many people you killed, man?

01:34:45.880 --> 01:34:48.155
You don't ask nobody
no question like that, ese.

01:34:48.320 --> 01:34:51.073
You ain't ever whacked down no women.

01:34:51.240 --> 01:34:52.719
No kids.

01:34:54.240 --> 01:34:55.832
I don't kill women or children.

01:34:56.360 --> 01:34:57.360
I do.

01:35:00.840 --> 01:35:03.434
See, I was born with the Devil's gift.

01:35:03.600 --> 01:35:06.956
I kept it hidden
for most of my life, but...

01:35:07.440 --> 01:35:10.079
The older I got, the stronger it got.

01:35:10.240 --> 01:35:11.992
So I started using it.

01:35:13.280 --> 01:35:14.952
For business, you know.

01:35:15.800 --> 01:35:18.268
The more power on the street I got,
the more fire power I got.

01:35:18.480 --> 01:35:19.840
Like, that shit went hand in hand.

01:35:19.880 --> 01:35:22.440
You know? One was feeding the other.

01:35:23.440 --> 01:35:25.590
Ain't nobody tell me no.

01:35:26.760 --> 01:35:28.273
Except my old lady.

01:35:30.840 --> 01:35:33.229
You know, she used to, uh, pray for me.

01:35:33.400 --> 01:35:34.400
You're welcome.

01:35:36.800 --> 01:35:38.028
Even when I didn't want it.

01:35:48.680 --> 01:35:50.636
God didn't give me this.

01:35:51.440 --> 01:35:53.829
Why should he take it away?

01:35:54.760 --> 01:35:55.829
Hey.

01:35:58.120 --> 01:35:59.155
This is our home.

01:35:59.320 --> 01:36:00.800
You put that back where you found it.

01:36:00.880 --> 01:36:02.359
I'm taking my kids to Mom's.

01:36:02.520 --> 01:36:04.511
You ain't taking my kids nowhere!

01:36:04.680 --> 01:36:07.911
See, when I get mad, I lose control.
You know, I just...

01:36:09.200 --> 01:36:10.200
I don't know what I do...

01:36:17.200 --> 01:36:18.838
...till it's done.

01:36:33.440 --> 01:36:34.793
And the kids?

01:36:38.200 --> 01:36:39.553
He killed them.

01:36:43.600 --> 01:36:44.953
Didn't you?

01:36:53.160 --> 01:36:54.752
Own that shit.

01:36:55.720 --> 01:36:56.720
Own it!

01:36:56.880 --> 01:36:59.394
What'd you think was gonna happen? Huh?

01:36:59.560 --> 01:37:01.232
Hey, Harley. Come on.

01:37:01.400 --> 01:37:03.118
What, you were just...

01:37:03.280 --> 01:37:04.872
Thinking you can have a happy family

01:37:05.040 --> 01:37:07.793
and coach little leagues,
and make car payments?

01:37:07.960 --> 01:37:09.678
Normal's a setting on the dryer.

01:37:09.880 --> 01:37:12.314
People like us, we don't get normal!

01:37:12.480 --> 01:37:14.675
Why is it always a knife fight

01:37:14.840 --> 01:37:17.559
every single time you open your mouth?

01:37:19.080 --> 01:37:22.595
You know, outside you're amazing.

01:37:24.160 --> 01:37:26.879
But inside, you're ugly.

01:37:27.040 --> 01:37:28.792
We all are.

01:37:28.960 --> 01:37:32.270
We all are! Except for him.

01:37:34.320 --> 01:37:35.958
He's ugly on the outside, too.

01:37:36.160 --> 01:37:38.230
Not me, shorty.

01:37:42.280 --> 01:37:44.111
I'm beautiful.

01:37:44.680 --> 01:37:46.875
Yeah, you are.

01:37:56.840 --> 01:37:58.353
We don't want you here.

01:38:05.960 --> 01:38:09.794
You get to the part in that binder
saying I was sleeping with her?

01:38:11.120 --> 01:38:12.348
Yeah.

01:38:13.720 --> 01:38:16.473
I never been with a witch before.
What's that like?

01:38:19.720 --> 01:38:23.030
Apparently, that's why the creatures
chase him all the time.

01:38:23.200 --> 01:38:26.078
'Cause, uh, the witch is scared of him.

01:38:26.240 --> 01:38:28.151
The only woman I ever cared about

01:38:28.720 --> 01:38:31.280
is trapped inside that monster.

01:38:31.440 --> 01:38:34.000
If I don't stop the witch, it's over.

01:38:34.160 --> 01:38:35.673
Everything is over.

01:38:35.840 --> 01:38:37.558
Everything.

01:38:40.760 --> 01:38:41.760
You're free to go.

01:38:56.320 --> 01:38:57.992
Your daughter writes you every day.

01:39:02.240 --> 01:39:04.037
Every single day.

01:39:19.840 --> 01:39:21.637
You had these the whole time?

01:39:23.200 --> 01:39:26.636
You had letters from my daughter
the whole time?

01:39:30.880 --> 01:39:32.199
I'm gonna get you there.

01:39:33.400 --> 01:39:35.038
And you're gonna end this.

01:39:35.200 --> 01:39:37.509
I'm gonna carry your ass if I have to.

01:39:38.840 --> 01:39:42.116
'Cause this shit is gonna be
like a chapter in the Bible.

01:39:42.680 --> 01:39:44.910
Everybody's gonna know what we did.

01:39:45.560 --> 01:39:50.554
And my daughter is gonna know
that her daddy is not a piece of shit.

01:40:00.240 --> 01:40:01.753
I'll come.

01:40:05.600 --> 01:40:06.999
What?

01:40:07.160 --> 01:40:08.559
You got something better to do?

01:40:08.720 --> 01:40:10.233
Come on!

01:40:12.360 --> 01:40:13.429
Pussies.

01:40:48.960 --> 01:40:51.349
We think that thing's a weapon.

01:40:51.560 --> 01:40:52.629
Here. Lower.

01:41:00.360 --> 01:41:02.237
We gotta take out the big one.

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:08.231
I left a big ass demo charge
down there in that subway.

01:41:09.680 --> 01:41:12.752
There's a flooded tunnel,
leads right underneath that building.

01:41:12.960 --> 01:41:17.351
SEALs, they can recover the charge,
swim in underneath that thing's feet.

01:41:17.520 --> 01:41:20.432
We get in its face and distract the hell
out of that son of a bitch

01:41:20.600 --> 01:41:21.960
so the swimmers can blow the bomb.

01:41:23.840 --> 01:41:25.751
That's how we take it out.

01:41:36.400 --> 01:41:38.152
I'm going with ya.

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:41.433
We got this.

01:41:41.600 --> 01:41:43.636
I'm not asking, bro.

01:41:47.160 --> 01:41:49.355
I live underground.

01:41:49.520 --> 01:41:51.829
Y'all are just tourists.

01:42:16.880 --> 01:42:19.314
The man who killed her husband
used that sword.

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:23.230
His soul's trapped inside of it.

01:42:23.960 --> 01:42:25.632
She talks to him.

01:42:26.360 --> 01:42:27.713
Hey, well,

01:42:27.880 --> 01:42:30.110
you know what they say
about the crazy ones.

01:42:31.680 --> 01:42:32.680
Huh?

01:42:40.240 --> 01:42:41.389
Let's do this.

01:43:19.280 --> 01:43:20.679
You must really love this girl.

01:43:25.240 --> 01:43:28.277
Man, I thought love was bullshit.
Dead serious.

01:43:29.880 --> 01:43:32.474
Desire, mutual benefit, whatever.

01:43:33.080 --> 01:43:35.958
I mean, I get that, but actual love?

01:43:36.360 --> 01:43:38.271
I rated that with UFOs.

01:43:39.160 --> 01:43:41.720
Lot of believers, no proof.

01:43:45.160 --> 01:43:46.878
And then I met June.

01:43:48.800 --> 01:43:50.472
Do what you gotta do.

01:43:52.160 --> 01:43:53.434
I got your back.

01:44:04.720 --> 01:44:06.080
You gonna fight with us?

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:08.956
What if I lose control?

01:44:09.120 --> 01:44:11.076
Then maybe we'll have a chance.

01:44:23.520 --> 01:44:24.520
Duck in.

01:44:37.560 --> 01:44:41.075
Hey, everyone can see
all this trippy magic stuff, right?

01:44:41.480 --> 01:44:43.038
Yeah. Why?

01:44:43.200 --> 01:44:45.077
I'm off my meds.

01:44:46.680 --> 01:44:48.240
So that's your old lady, huh?

01:44:48.800 --> 01:44:49.994
Yeah.

01:44:50.160 --> 01:44:52.037
Well, you need to handle
this shit, all right?

01:44:52.200 --> 01:44:55.875
Get up there, smack on her ass,
tell her, "Knock this shit off."

01:44:56.040 --> 01:44:58.190
I do not think that'd be wise.

01:44:58.360 --> 01:45:00.351
I'm gonna draw out the big one.

01:45:00.560 --> 01:45:02.994
My boys will detonate the bomb
underneath him.

01:45:07.400 --> 01:45:09.868
You know, we should get a drink sometime.

01:45:10.720 --> 01:45:13.678
I've been waiting for you all night.

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:18.913
Step out of the shadows. I won't bite.

01:45:21.560 --> 01:45:22.675
Hmm.

01:45:22.840 --> 01:45:24.671
What the hell? Grab her.

01:45:26.320 --> 01:45:28.515
Why are you here?

01:45:28.680 --> 01:45:31.831
Because the soldier led you?

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:33.558
And all for Waller.

01:45:33.760 --> 01:45:36.718
Why do you serve those who cage you?

01:45:36.920 --> 01:45:39.195
I am your ally.

01:45:39.360 --> 01:45:41.794
And I know what you want.

01:45:41.960 --> 01:45:44.838
Exactly what you want.

01:46:26.560 --> 01:46:28.118
Baby. Baby.

01:46:29.080 --> 01:46:31.799
Baby, it's just a nightmare.

01:46:33.080 --> 01:46:34.798
It's just a bad dream.

01:46:35.440 --> 01:46:36.634
I'm here.

01:46:47.440 --> 01:46:48.555
Miss me?

01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:59.390
I'll put the kids to sleep
and then maybe we can kick it?

01:47:01.240 --> 01:47:02.240
Yeah?

01:47:04.200 --> 01:47:08.239
I can't change what I did.
And neither can you!

01:47:08.440 --> 01:47:10.032
He married me!

01:47:11.680 --> 01:47:12.999
It's not real.

01:47:13.600 --> 01:47:14.715
I killed the Bat.

01:47:14.880 --> 01:47:16.472
Nah, homie. You don't want that.

01:47:17.080 --> 01:47:18.718
What? I want that.

01:47:18.880 --> 01:47:20.440
She trying to play games with you, man.

01:47:20.600 --> 01:47:22.318
- It's not real!
- He's right.

01:47:23.160 --> 01:47:24.354
It's not real.

01:47:27.120 --> 01:47:29.588
How long have you been able to see?

01:47:30.320 --> 01:47:31.719
My whole life.

01:47:33.200 --> 01:47:34.792
You can't have them.

01:47:34.960 --> 01:47:36.234
These are my people right here.

01:47:36.400 --> 01:47:38.197
But it is our time.

01:47:38.360 --> 01:47:43.195
The sun is setting, and the magic rises.
The metahumans are a sign of change.

01:47:44.880 --> 01:47:47.952
Lady, you are evil!

01:47:53.120 --> 01:47:54.189
Oh, wow.

01:47:57.440 --> 01:47:58.589
Uh-oh.

01:47:59.440 --> 01:48:00.668
Who's this?

01:48:01.280 --> 01:48:03.191
- It's gonna be bad!
- We should run.

01:48:15.240 --> 01:48:16.798
GQ, come in. We're in position.

01:48:26.280 --> 01:48:28.760
We gotta get him in that corner.
That's where the bomb will be.

01:48:28.880 --> 01:48:30.598
I'll do it! I'll get him there.

01:48:44.600 --> 01:48:46.560
I lost one family.
I ain't gonna lose another one.

01:48:46.600 --> 01:48:47.919
Look, think it through.

01:48:48.120 --> 01:48:51.430
I got this.
Let me show you what I really am.

01:48:53.120 --> 01:48:54.120
Over here!

01:49:36.840 --> 01:49:37.840
Go!

01:49:52.280 --> 01:49:53.759
Rick, in position. Standing by.

01:49:53.920 --> 01:49:55.751
Diablo, drive him into the corner!

01:50:10.600 --> 01:50:11.669
- Get him, mate!
- Come on.

01:50:13.720 --> 01:50:15.039
Yeah, do it!

01:50:25.320 --> 01:50:27.197
Diablo, get clear! Get outta there!

01:50:27.360 --> 01:50:28.793
Blow it!

01:50:31.960 --> 01:50:33.029
Blow it.

01:50:35.720 --> 01:50:38.234
- Now, GQ. Now.
- No!

01:50:39.880 --> 01:50:41.108
Everybody, down!

01:51:19.160 --> 01:51:20.229
You next.

01:51:21.920 --> 01:51:24.957
My spell is complete.

01:51:25.120 --> 01:51:28.908
Once you and your armies are gone,
my darkness will spread across this world.

01:51:29.080 --> 01:51:32.516
And it will be mine to rule.

01:51:47.880 --> 01:51:49.677
That was our main satellite uplink.

01:51:54.800 --> 01:51:56.616
How did this witch even know
how to target this thing?

01:51:56.640 --> 01:51:58.471
It's a secret facility.

01:52:03.360 --> 01:52:05.032
You got a move here, Flag?

01:52:05.200 --> 01:52:07.236
We gotta cut her heart out.

01:52:38.560 --> 01:52:39.640
While we're fighting,

01:52:39.720 --> 01:52:41.995
that thing's laying waste
to the whole damn world.

01:52:49.240 --> 01:52:50.514
Where is she?

01:52:51.520 --> 01:52:53.400
I don't know.

01:52:57.160 --> 01:52:58.160
Hey.

01:53:04.520 --> 01:53:05.748
Look out. Look out!

01:53:28.600 --> 01:53:29.600
Uh-oh.

01:53:29.800 --> 01:53:31.028
Sorry.

01:53:36.840 --> 01:53:38.239
Flag!

01:54:12.560 --> 01:54:13.834
Enough!

01:54:17.840 --> 01:54:23.039
Of all who have faced me,
you have earned mercy.

01:54:23.200 --> 01:54:25.077
For the last time,

01:54:25.760 --> 01:54:28.957
join me, or die.

01:54:31.280 --> 01:54:33.874
I'm not much of a joiner,

01:54:35.120 --> 01:54:37.076
but maybe we should.

01:54:37.240 --> 01:54:38.639
Hey!

01:54:38.800 --> 01:54:40.438
She's trying to take over the world.

01:54:40.640 --> 01:54:41.755
So?

01:54:42.440 --> 01:54:45.591
What's the world ever done for us, anyway?
It hates us.

01:54:46.560 --> 01:54:48.039
Hey, Harley!

01:54:51.480 --> 01:54:54.153
Hey, lady? Um...

01:54:56.080 --> 01:54:57.957
I lost my Puddin'.

01:54:59.560 --> 01:55:01.232
But you can get him back, right?

01:55:02.160 --> 01:55:04.310
I can, my dear.

01:55:04.760 --> 01:55:07.433
Anything you want.

01:55:10.400 --> 01:55:11.515
You promise?

01:55:11.680 --> 01:55:13.398
Yes, child.

01:55:15.160 --> 01:55:16.479
You need only bow

01:55:18.360 --> 01:55:21.636
and serve beneath my feet.

01:55:26.520 --> 01:55:28.795
I like what you're sellin', lady.

01:55:29.520 --> 01:55:32.956
There's just one teeny problem.

01:55:34.520 --> 01:55:35.600
You messed with my friends.

01:55:41.680 --> 01:55:43.910
Her heart's out! We can end this!

01:55:48.200 --> 01:55:50.156
Hey, Croc!

01:55:52.960 --> 01:55:54.188
Harley!

01:56:38.880 --> 01:56:41.030
Please, Daddy. Don't do it.

01:56:42.560 --> 01:56:46.394
The only way for us to be together
is if you don't pull the trigger.

01:56:47.320 --> 01:56:48.912
Daddy, I love you.

01:56:49.840 --> 01:56:51.796
Please, don't do this.

01:57:46.920 --> 01:57:48.000
That was a great shot, man.

01:57:48.200 --> 01:57:50.395
Hey, I don't do hugs. I'm not a hugger.

01:57:50.560 --> 01:57:53.199
I'm not a hugger. All right?

01:57:59.920 --> 01:58:02.309
Let me join my brother.

01:58:03.320 --> 01:58:04.514
Katana, no!

01:58:09.560 --> 01:58:10.754
Give me that.

01:58:12.840 --> 01:58:15.638
You bring June back. You bring her back.

01:58:15.800 --> 01:58:17.756
She's not coming back.

01:58:17.920 --> 01:58:20.559
I'll crush this. Do you hear me?

01:58:20.720 --> 01:58:22.597
You bring June back or I'll crush this!

01:58:22.760 --> 01:58:23.988
Go ahead.

01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:26.797
You don't have the balls.

01:59:19.880 --> 01:59:20.915
Hey, Flag.

01:59:30.520 --> 01:59:31.589
June!

01:59:41.160 --> 01:59:42.832
She's gone.

01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:46.276
I thought I killed you.

01:59:47.320 --> 01:59:49.788
Y'all don't mind,

01:59:49.960 --> 01:59:52.599
I got me a sewer to crawl back into.

01:59:52.760 --> 01:59:55.274
Yeah, and I got some business to handle
back in Gotham.

01:59:55.440 --> 01:59:57.112
I'm going to hotwire a car. Need a ride?

01:59:57.280 --> 01:59:58.554
Your ass is not driving.

01:59:58.720 --> 01:59:59.755
Why not?

02:00:02.520 --> 02:00:04.317
How are you not dead?

02:00:04.960 --> 02:00:06.632
We just saved the world.

02:00:07.440 --> 02:00:09.317
A "thank you" would be nice.

02:00:09.960 --> 02:00:11.075
Thank you.

02:00:12.040 --> 02:00:13.075
You're welcome.

02:00:13.240 --> 02:00:15.000
So, we did all of this
and we don't get shit?

02:00:15.160 --> 02:00:17.674
Ten years off your prison sentences.

02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:23.833
Nah, that's not enough.
I'm seeing my daughter.

02:00:26.320 --> 02:00:27.639
That can be arranged.

02:00:28.960 --> 02:00:30.279
Any other requests?

02:00:30.920 --> 02:00:32.478
Ooh. An espresso machine.

02:00:33.480 --> 02:00:35.118
BET.

02:00:35.800 --> 02:00:38.439
Ten years off a triple life sentence?

02:00:38.600 --> 02:00:40.352
Darling, I'm walking
out of here a free man

02:00:40.520 --> 02:00:42.351
or we're going
to start having some real fun.

02:00:42.520 --> 02:00:44.431
Why don't we have some fun?

02:00:54.320 --> 02:00:56.880
You're trying to figure out this length.

02:00:57.840 --> 02:00:58.989
That's the hypotenuse.

02:00:59.160 --> 02:01:00.991
So, you have to know this angle.

02:01:01.160 --> 02:01:05.392
Okay. So, if you're up here,
like in a building,

02:01:05.560 --> 02:01:08.677
and you shoot a man
down here on the street,

02:01:08.840 --> 02:01:10.956
that's how far the bullet actually goes?

02:01:11.840 --> 02:01:13.831
Yeah. That's right.

02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:15.656
You are so smart. Right.

02:01:15.680 --> 02:01:18.319
The hypotenuse. Good one. Um...

02:01:19.200 --> 02:01:21.000
So, that would make you
have to know the angle

02:01:21.040 --> 02:01:23.349
between the building and the sidewalk.

02:01:23.520 --> 02:01:25.033
You got to know that angle.

02:01:25.200 --> 02:01:27.919
No, I mean, in real life,
you have variables.

02:01:28.080 --> 02:01:29.360
You know, you got rifling twist.

02:01:29.520 --> 02:01:31.875
You got chamber pressure.
You got bullet weight.

02:01:32.880 --> 02:01:34.836
Some shots you'll even
have to take the curvature

02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:37.016
of the Earth in with the...

02:01:37.040 --> 02:01:38.040
It's time.

02:01:39.560 --> 02:01:40.754
...wind effect.

02:01:42.080 --> 02:01:44.150
You know, there's a lot of variables

02:01:45.400 --> 02:01:46.879
in the street.

02:01:50.720 --> 02:01:51.869
I gotta go.

02:01:52.880 --> 02:01:54.199
Are you coming back?

02:01:55.720 --> 02:01:56.755
Yeah.

02:01:56.920 --> 02:01:59.514
I'm working it out. All right?

02:01:59.680 --> 02:02:03.639
You know, I promised my friends
that I would just, you know, go,

02:02:03.800 --> 02:02:06.234
without killing them all.

02:02:06.400 --> 02:02:07.549
Bring it in.

02:02:10.880 --> 02:02:12.074
I love you, Daddy.

02:02:12.240 --> 02:02:13.240
Hmm.

02:02:14.920 --> 02:02:16.114
I love you.

02:02:42.240 --> 02:02:44.595
Hey! Let me out!

02:02:44.760 --> 02:02:46.637
Let me out of here right now!

02:02:46.800 --> 02:02:49.758
Hey! You feel that? Yeah.

02:02:50.640 --> 02:02:52.551
Let me out of here, darling, please.

02:02:52.760 --> 02:02:54.096
Please, I'm begging you, seriously.

02:02:54.120 --> 02:02:57.430
Listen to me. Have you got a car?
Because I'm a brilliant driver.

02:02:57.640 --> 02:02:58.993
Come on!

02:03:53.960 --> 02:03:55.473
Puddin'!

02:03:57.800 --> 02:03:59.472
Let's go home.

02:06:23.880 --> 02:06:26.269
This is crown jewels here,
Mr. Wayne.

02:06:27.360 --> 02:06:29.316
And you do understand my legal exposure.

02:06:29.480 --> 02:06:31.516
If anyone knew what I procured for you...

02:06:31.680 --> 02:06:34.877
Listen, I can keep a secret, okay?

02:06:35.040 --> 02:06:36.268
What do you want?

02:06:36.480 --> 02:06:39.040
People are asking questions
about Midway City.

02:06:39.200 --> 02:06:40.880
The kind of people
who can get the answers.

02:06:40.960 --> 02:06:43.997
And if they can get those answers,
my head will be on a pike.

02:06:44.200 --> 02:06:46.794
Consider yourself under my protection.

02:06:46.960 --> 02:06:48.234
If you deliver.

02:07:04.520 --> 02:07:05.999
Why, Mr. Wayne?

02:07:08.360 --> 02:07:09.918
Just like to make friends.

02:07:11.560 --> 02:07:12.696
That's the difference between us.

02:07:12.720 --> 02:07:15.029
You believe in friendship.
I believe in leverage.

02:07:16.440 --> 02:07:17.475
Good night.

02:07:17.640 --> 02:07:19.631
You look tired.

02:07:19.800 --> 02:07:21.916
You should stop working nights.

02:07:22.880 --> 02:07:26.873
You should shut it down,
or my friends and I'll do it for you.
