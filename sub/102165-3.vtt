00:01.060 --> 00:02.484
Sumi: (on phone)
<i>  Congratulations!</i>

00:02.562 --> 00:05.320
<i>  You're part of the CBTV</i>
<i>  comedy diversity workshop!</i>

00:05.398 --> 00:06.505
-Thank you.
-She got in!

00:09.660 --> 00:11.919
Aren't you opening this firm
to help people like Jerod?

00:11.996 --> 00:13.346
I'll do it
on one condition.

00:13.422 --> 00:16.240
You quit Legal Aid
and come work for me.

00:16.242 --> 00:17.424
You see that woman
in the jean jacket?

00:17.501 --> 00:19.185
Her name's Yvonne Byers.

00:19.262 --> 00:21.687
Is there any way
you can help her?

00:21.764 --> 00:22.855
Gael:
<i>  Hey, have you seen Dennis?</i>

00:22.932 --> 00:24.582
I can't come back
to the Coterie.

00:24.584 --> 00:27.360
I think I've been trying
to find a way out of this,

00:27.436 --> 00:28.602
<i>  when I need to find</i>
<i>  a way through it.</i>

00:28.679 --> 00:29.937
We have a problem.

00:30.014 --> 00:31.697
Mariana:
<i>  White supremacists?</i>

00:31.774 --> 00:32.757
Claire:
<i>  They've flooded ACT-ivism.</i>

00:32.759 --> 00:33.148
We have to shut it down.

00:34.761 --> 00:36.777
Evan:
<i>  We're about to launch</i>
<i>  a new social network app.</i>

00:36.854 --> 00:40.155
<i>  We can't be seen</i>
<i>  catering to only those users</i>
<i>  whose politics we agree with.</i>

00:40.950 --> 00:42.708
Mariana:
<i>  I understand.</i>

00:42.785 --> 00:45.027
<i>  It's your company. Your call.</i>

00:45.104 --> 00:46.103
<i>  But I can't be</i>
<i>  a part of it anymore.</i>

00:46.105 --> 00:46.829
What about us?

00:48.941 --> 00:49.048
Mariana:
<i>  I don't know.</i>

I'm Derek.

01:56.008 --> 01:57.341
I write, act, and direct.

01:57.343 --> 02:00.069
I'm like a less tragic,
more clothed Lena Dunham.

02:02.181 --> 02:03.122
I'm Magdalena. Magda.

02:05.017 --> 02:06.942
This season,
I tested for two pilots.

02:07.019 --> 02:09.962
And my Harold team,
Taylor Grift,

02:10.039 --> 02:10.963
just got
our own monthly show at UCB.

02:11.040 --> 02:13.040
So, yeah,
I'm pretty much on fire.

02:14.861 --> 02:17.027
I'm Sanjana.

02:17.029 --> 02:17.378
I worked with
Second City in Chicago.

02:18.865 --> 02:21.699
Since I moved to LA, I've done
pretty much everything,

02:21.701 --> 02:23.217
from being a budtender

02:23.293 --> 02:24.259
to an assistant manager
at a movie theater.

02:25.705 --> 02:26.220
You can't hurt me.

02:28.541 --> 02:30.465
Hi, I'm Stacey,

02:30.543 --> 02:33.210
@NotActuallyLizzo on TikTok.

02:33.212 --> 02:36.063
But you may know me
from my musical
<i>  Homages to Riverdale.</i>

02:37.717 --> 02:41.494
Shaun. Uh, I have
a YouTube channel,
Trans Fats.

02:41.570 --> 02:42.569
'Cause I'm... trans.

02:43.890 --> 02:45.998
Um, I actually just hit
a million followers.

02:47.651 --> 02:51.170
But my real dream is to host
<i>  The Great British Baking Show.</i>

02:53.157 --> 02:54.340
I have a lot of
soggy bottom material.

02:56.085 --> 02:59.512
Lindsay Brady.
I'm a stand-up.

02:59.588 --> 03:01.755
I just finished up
a 36-city North American tour.

03:03.333 --> 03:05.342
Your queer cousin in Arkansas
just absolutely loves me.

03:07.246 --> 03:08.020
I'm Alice.

03:10.766 --> 03:12.249
You sure we can't
scare a chair up for you?

03:12.251 --> 03:15.085
Oh, no, it's okay.
I like it on the floor.

03:15.087 --> 03:16.587
Whoever set up obviously
didn't get the memo!

03:16.589 --> 03:18.531
Hello! (laughs)

03:18.607 --> 03:22.350
Normally, we have, uh,
six performers in the program.

03:22.428 --> 03:23.702
Uh, but this year,
we made an exception.

03:23.779 --> 03:24.703
No worries.
I don't need a seat.

03:24.780 --> 03:27.206
I should've
sat down quicker anyway.

03:27.283 --> 03:28.040
I was never good
at musical chairs.

03:30.286 --> 03:32.711
Um, I've done some stand-up,
and I really like it.

03:34.440 --> 03:36.039
And I have 312 followers
on Instagram.

03:37.109 --> 03:39.367
Clearly,
she was the exception.

03:39.445 --> 03:42.037
Well, then,
put your hands together.
Come on.

03:42.114 --> 03:43.872
-(all applauding)
-Hello!

03:43.950 --> 03:45.282
Woo!

03:45.284 --> 03:49.303
Welcome, performers.
You're here. Welcome.

03:49.379 --> 03:50.512
As your program director,
it is my job...

03:52.792 --> 03:53.457
to make or break
your careers.

03:53.459 --> 03:54.567
I'm kidding.
(laughs)

03:56.295 --> 03:59.221
Seriously, this program

03:59.298 --> 04:03.075
has launched
just some big talent and...

04:03.152 --> 04:05.077
I mean, what a great time
to be diverse.

04:05.154 --> 04:07.246
Am I right? Yeah?
Right? Come on.

04:07.323 --> 04:08.247
Diversity is like
the new Black, right?

04:08.324 --> 04:09.731
Even if you're not Black.

04:09.809 --> 04:10.899
I can say that
because this comedy.

04:10.977 --> 04:11.241
This is a safe space.

04:12.995 --> 04:13.902
Not for me.
Not this white guy.

04:13.980 --> 04:15.537
"Help me.
I need to work."

04:18.000 --> 04:18.916
So, you could be
the next Tiffany Haddish.

04:20.503 --> 04:22.152
The next Aubrey Plaza
in El Barrio.

04:22.154 --> 04:24.746
Funny Indian guy, yeah?

04:24.824 --> 04:26.081
You're gonna be
crazy and rich very soon.

04:26.158 --> 04:27.174
(laughs)

04:28.585 --> 04:31.662
You could be Pat.
Think about that.
Am I right?

04:31.664 --> 04:33.105
(Scott laughing)

04:33.182 --> 04:37.092
I mean, this is the first day
of the rest of your life.

04:37.169 --> 04:37.684
-Yes?
-I'm sorry.

04:38.537 --> 04:40.946
-Who's Pat?
-Oh!

04:41.023 --> 04:42.597
Pat was an SNL character.

04:42.675 --> 04:45.342
(laughs) Pat--
You didn't know if Pat

04:45.344 --> 04:46.619
was a boy or a girl.

04:46.695 --> 04:49.179
So, "Ugh" was the catchphrase.

04:49.181 --> 04:51.573
(laughs)
It was very, very funny.
Yeah.

04:53.185 --> 04:56.703
Here's to the yet-to-be-named
fight club ladies startup.

04:56.780 --> 05:00.633
And to never having to work
with dumb-ass tech bros
ever again.

05:00.709 --> 05:02.376
Amen to that.

05:02.452 --> 05:04.803
Sorry, I was at the gyno.

05:04.880 --> 05:06.121
Trying to squeeze in
all my doctors

05:06.198 --> 05:07.197
before our health insurance
runs out.

05:07.199 --> 05:09.299
Smart. Everyone get
your Pap smears.

05:11.203 --> 05:12.627
Claire:
We should talk
about money.

05:12.705 --> 05:13.145
Uh, how long can...

05:14.557 --> 05:16.315
everyone last until we have
to get another job?

05:18.044 --> 05:19.309
I think I can go, like,
three months.

05:20.546 --> 05:21.144
-Two.
-Same.

05:22.381 --> 05:23.897
Three... weeks.

05:25.718 --> 05:26.149
Sorry.

05:27.311 --> 05:28.902
No, no, that's okay.

05:28.979 --> 05:31.055
It's just, you know,
more motivation

05:31.057 --> 05:31.664
to come up with
an amazing app idea

05:31.740 --> 05:33.891
and get funded ASAP.

05:33.893 --> 05:35.167
Claire:
There's this tech incubator

05:35.244 --> 05:37.061
that does open pitch events
twice a year.

05:37.063 --> 05:38.320
They have one
coming up in two weeks.

05:38.397 --> 05:38.495
Two weeks?
That's...

05:39.990 --> 05:40.247
not a lot of time.

05:42.735 --> 05:45.736
I've had an idea
for a while.

05:45.738 --> 05:48.681
What about an eco-friendly
bath and beauty product
delivery app?

05:49.499 --> 05:50.832
We generate an algorithm

05:50.910 --> 05:53.185
that tracks all the products
that our customers use

05:53.262 --> 05:55.003
and how much they use,

05:55.081 --> 05:56.338
then we ship them out
in reusable containers.

05:56.357 --> 05:58.473
We can keep refilling them,
cutting down on waste.

06:00.436 --> 06:02.086
I love it.

06:02.088 --> 06:02.811
-Me too.
-Me too.

06:04.590 --> 06:05.698
Uh, we could call it
Bulk Beauty.

06:05.774 --> 06:08.425
Ooh, or BB for short.

06:08.427 --> 06:09.868
Five minutes in,
and we've got a great idea!

06:09.945 --> 06:11.428
Yeah, take that, Evan Speck!

06:11.430 --> 06:14.689
We don't need
your white supremacist
protecting ass!

06:14.767 --> 06:16.450
-(door opens)
-Kelly: Mariana!

06:16.526 --> 06:18.377
Another delivery
for you.

06:18.454 --> 06:20.379
At your service.

06:20.456 --> 06:22.122
Wow!
Who are those from?

06:26.536 --> 06:26.719
They're from Evan.

06:30.783 --> 06:31.131
Seems horny.

06:32.468 --> 06:34.217
Ugh! DTF? Seriously--

06:35.788 --> 06:38.880
Aww. "Down to<i>  fight</i>  for you."

06:38.958 --> 06:39.556
Huh. Cute.

06:40.809 --> 06:41.350
-May I?
-Yeah.

06:46.723 --> 06:47.573
I love a good "F"
in the morning.

06:47.650 --> 06:48.482
(chuckles)

06:51.228 --> 06:51.243
What are you gonna do?

06:53.139 --> 06:54.071
You kind of left him hanging.

06:55.307 --> 06:55.822
Yeah, well...

06:57.810 --> 06:59.752
I mean, the girls quit
in solidarity with me

06:59.828 --> 07:01.478
because of Evan.

07:01.480 --> 07:03.756
I can't just turn around
and be like,

07:03.832 --> 07:04.539
"Oh, yeah, by the way,
I'm also dating him."

07:07.169 --> 07:07.542
Well, then, you need
to tell him that.

07:09.413 --> 07:10.596
I know, and I will.

07:12.658 --> 07:12.747
Uh, don't, don't.
Don't tell me who it is.

07:14.160 --> 07:16.009
Calm down.
I didn't have time
to read the card.

07:17.179 --> 07:17.936
This time.

07:23.502 --> 07:24.443
Gina:
Who's your secret admirer?

07:24.520 --> 07:25.352
(all giggling)

07:29.842 --> 07:31.766
They're from my moms.
My moms.

07:31.844 --> 07:32.693
Aww, what's the occasion?

07:35.939 --> 07:35.954
It's my birthday.

07:37.441 --> 07:39.625
-Why didn't you say something?
-Claire: Oh, my God!

07:39.702 --> 07:42.127
-Happy birthday!
-Cheers!

07:42.204 --> 07:42.953
Claire:
Let's drink.
Happy birthday.

07:50.863 --> 07:52.421
I cannot
be late for work.

07:57.369 --> 07:59.036
Excuse me. Hi.

07:59.038 --> 08:01.538
Uh, we're still waiting
for our appointment
with DA Matthews.

08:01.540 --> 08:04.057
I'm sorry, he was just called
into an emergency meeting.

08:08.731 --> 08:10.305
Uh, Mr. Matthews.

08:10.382 --> 08:13.217
Uh, my name's
Callie Adams Foster.

08:13.219 --> 08:14.809
My client, Yvonne Byers, and I
had an appointment with you
at 10:00 a.m.

08:14.887 --> 08:15.277
Sorry, something's come up.

08:17.072 --> 08:19.481
Um, this is the third time
you've rescheduled
at the last minute.

08:19.558 --> 08:22.317
I-- I can't keep dragging
my client down here.

08:22.394 --> 08:25.153
Okay, uh,
I'll cut her fines in half

08:25.231 --> 08:26.730
in exchange for 50 more
community service hours.

08:26.732 --> 08:28.457
Wait, that's 350 hours now.

08:30.252 --> 08:31.585
Look, she works two jobs
and has three kids.

08:33.239 --> 08:35.255
How is she supposed to find
the extra time in her life?

08:35.332 --> 08:36.089
It's the best last offer.
Take it or leave it.

08:40.763 --> 08:42.670
Kathleen:
Good morning.

08:42.748 --> 08:44.014
Oh, uh, good morning.
Are you here for me?

08:45.918 --> 08:48.101
No. I have a meeting
with the DA on Jerod's case.

08:48.178 --> 08:48.810
But you're more than welcome
to join me.

08:53.592 --> 08:54.758
She wants to take the deal.

08:54.760 --> 08:56.351
Yeah,
of course she does.

08:56.428 --> 08:57.194
I mean,
that's what they do.

08:59.114 --> 09:00.372
They keep rescheduling
to wear you down

09:00.449 --> 09:01.948
so you take the shitty deal.

09:02.025 --> 09:03.375
Don't let her do it.

09:03.452 --> 09:04.526
But he said
it's his best and last offer.

09:04.603 --> 09:07.695
Bullshit. There's always
a better offer.

09:07.773 --> 09:08.547
You can't trust
any of these assholes.

09:08.624 --> 09:10.440
-(door opens)
-Marc!

09:10.442 --> 09:11.541
-Kathleen.
-Hi!

09:12.778 --> 09:14.336
-Hello.
-Hello.

09:19.618 --> 09:19.892
(sighs)

09:20.953 --> 09:24.045
Uh, so,
we got in a fight

09:24.123 --> 09:24.805
and Miss Neal told us
to come to your classroom.

09:26.792 --> 09:27.232
What's up with that?

09:29.144 --> 09:30.569
We raised attention
with the walk-out,

09:32.131 --> 09:33.221
but we're still a long way

09:33.299 --> 09:35.390
to getting
the diversion program abolished

09:35.467 --> 09:36.191
and the police
out of our school.

09:37.319 --> 09:39.561
In the meantime,
we need to make sure

09:39.638 --> 09:40.403
that they don't send
any more of our kids to juvie.

09:41.473 --> 09:42.030
Well, how do we do that?

09:43.826 --> 09:43.916
Andre Johnson
has two strikes already.

09:45.494 --> 09:48.903
One thing we can do
is stop sending them
to the principal

09:48.981 --> 09:49.755
every time
they act out in class.

09:52.151 --> 09:53.425
I hear that,
but what do
we do with them?

09:55.154 --> 09:55.243
It's not fair to the kids
who want to learn.

09:57.323 --> 09:57.754
What if we sent them
to each other?

09:59.174 --> 10:00.824
During our free periods.

10:00.826 --> 10:02.267
Well, how do we...
handle them?

10:04.680 --> 10:08.332
We practice the restorative
justice initiative
we've been talking about.

10:08.334 --> 10:09.424
I like that idea.

10:09.501 --> 10:09.850
Yeah, me too.

10:10.686 --> 10:11.518
I'm in.

10:13.672 --> 10:14.938
Me too. Sounds great.

10:17.860 --> 10:18.900
Well, Andre,
we're trying something new.

10:20.846 --> 10:22.287
A better approach
to conflict resolution.

10:22.364 --> 10:23.947
It's called
restorative justice.

10:26.518 --> 10:26.575
What the hell
does that mean?

10:28.187 --> 10:32.297
To be honest, I have no idea
what restorative justice is.

10:32.374 --> 10:33.707
Oh. Well, don't worry.

10:33.783 --> 10:36.468
I mean, I didn't either
until I joined the committee.

10:36.545 --> 10:38.378
-Oops, sorry.
-It's okay.

10:38.455 --> 10:41.198
Uh, basically,
it's just, uh, a change

10:41.200 --> 10:42.048
in how we respond
to misbehavior.

10:44.203 --> 10:46.144
Focusing
on mediation and agreement

10:46.221 --> 10:48.372
rather than punishment.

10:48.374 --> 10:49.890
So instead of sending you
to the principal's office,

10:49.966 --> 10:50.482
we're going
to talk it through.

10:52.544 --> 10:53.143
You know, take responsibility
for our actions

10:54.713 --> 10:56.605
discuss how to repair the harm
you've caused each other.

10:57.974 --> 10:59.049
Well, he started it.

10:59.051 --> 11:00.550
No, man,
your face started it.

11:00.552 --> 11:02.402
No, don't--
Don't hit each other.

11:02.479 --> 11:03.495
-I can send you some articles.
-Thanks.

11:05.391 --> 11:06.573
And thank you
for helping me clean up.

11:06.650 --> 11:08.392
Oh, yeah. Of course.

11:08.394 --> 11:09.242
No worries.

11:13.065 --> 11:14.731
This Coterie thing
seems pretty cool.

11:14.733 --> 11:15.582
What's communal living like?

11:15.659 --> 11:17.083
Well, it has
its pros and cons.

11:18.662 --> 11:19.736
Like, on the positive side,

11:19.738 --> 11:20.921
there's always
someone to talk to.

11:22.499 --> 11:23.757
And on the negative side,

11:23.833 --> 11:25.133
there's always
someone to talk to.

11:27.913 --> 11:28.854
I live alone
with a cat, so...

11:31.250 --> 11:31.765
You're a cat person?

11:32.918 --> 11:33.525
No, not really, um...

11:35.421 --> 11:37.696
My ex, they were
a cat person,

11:37.773 --> 11:41.533
and when they decided
that they weren't
a me person anymore,

11:41.610 --> 11:42.984
they left
the both of us. So...

11:45.188 --> 11:46.204
That sucks.

11:47.482 --> 11:48.365
Yeah, uh...

11:50.193 --> 11:51.601
You know, I'm...

11:51.603 --> 11:53.286
I'm really glad
you joined
the equity committee.

11:54.606 --> 11:56.606
Me too.

11:56.608 --> 11:56.998
Don't worry, I think
you're gonna do great.

11:59.127 --> 11:59.709
Thank you.

12:02.114 --> 12:03.129
This is the talking ball.

12:04.783 --> 12:08.285
Whomever is holding it
is talking.

12:08.287 --> 12:08.718
And you can squish it
if you're nervous.

12:11.381 --> 12:11.730
Who wants to start?

12:12.975 --> 12:15.400
Guys, no!

12:15.477 --> 12:17.051
Andre, don't do it!
Stop it!

12:17.129 --> 12:18.144
No! Give me the ball!

12:18.221 --> 12:20.797
Ha-ha!

12:20.799 --> 12:22.966
Well, seeing as your client
assaulted a deputy,

12:22.968 --> 12:23.733
I mean, my hands
are pretty much tied here.

12:25.304 --> 12:28.154
What is
your best offer, Marc?

12:29.399 --> 12:30.082
Well, as a favor to you,

12:31.568 --> 12:32.084
we're just asking
for the minimum.

12:32.160 --> 12:33.477
One year in jail.

12:33.479 --> 12:35.570
With credit for good behavior
and time served,

12:35.647 --> 12:35.912
he's out in six months.

12:37.574 --> 12:39.316
Kathleen:
That seems fair.

12:39.318 --> 12:41.485
All right, I will
take it to my client

12:41.487 --> 12:42.761
and let you get back
to the golf course.

12:42.838 --> 12:43.762
I wish.

12:45.749 --> 12:46.098
Hey, what is this I hear,
you left your own firm?

12:47.917 --> 12:52.012
Yes, I wanted to get back
to my beginnings,
in non-profit work.

12:52.088 --> 12:53.254
I mean, God knows,
I have enough money.

12:53.332 --> 12:53.921
Love to the family.

12:53.999 --> 12:55.999
We will be in touch.

12:56.001 --> 12:56.132
Sounds good.

13:00.930 --> 13:02.096
I thought you said
there's always a better deal.

13:02.174 --> 13:04.174
Not in this case.

13:04.176 --> 13:07.861
We aren't talking about
a bunch of unpaid
parking tickets here.

13:07.937 --> 13:09.863
The DA takes
assault of a sheriff

13:09.939 --> 13:11.364
very seriously.

13:11.441 --> 13:12.349
But they deprived him
of his medicine

13:12.351 --> 13:13.700
and he was
defending himself.

13:13.777 --> 13:17.871
Okay, we only have the word
of a mentally ill defendant.

13:17.947 --> 13:18.522
We have no evidence,

13:18.524 --> 13:20.857
no card to play.

13:20.859 --> 13:22.542
Maybe if we
investigate the deputy?

13:22.619 --> 13:23.785
Subpoena
his personnel records?

13:23.862 --> 13:24.294
Maybe there
is a pattern of abuse.

13:26.198 --> 13:27.380
If we could get
his personnel records.

13:29.034 --> 13:29.632
And that would mean
going to trial.

13:30.869 --> 13:32.978
So we go to trial.
Let a jury decide.

13:33.055 --> 13:34.629
(sighs)
Okay, if we do that,

13:34.706 --> 13:37.149
Jerod will be in jail
for at least a year,
maybe more.

13:38.710 --> 13:40.986
And if we lose,
which is likely,

13:41.063 --> 13:42.062
he could be in
for two or three years.

13:46.476 --> 13:47.659
The longer he's in jail,
the worse he will fare.

13:49.237 --> 13:49.986
It's the lesser
of two evils, Callie.

13:54.150 --> 13:55.392
I suggest
if you want to help him,

13:55.394 --> 13:56.451
you tell him
to take the deal.

14:01.157 --> 14:02.340
-Whoosh.
-Whoosh.

14:02.417 --> 14:03.917
Bang.

14:03.993 --> 14:04.992
-Whoosh.
-Whoosh.

14:05.070 --> 14:06.678
-Whoosh.
-Whoosh.

14:06.755 --> 14:07.670
-Whoosh.
-Pow!

14:08.924 --> 14:10.173
(groaning)

14:14.746 --> 14:17.597
In six weeks,
you will do a sketch showcase

14:17.674 --> 14:19.507
for Hollywood.

14:19.585 --> 14:20.975
I mean, top producers,

14:22.087 --> 14:22.694
the execs,

14:24.013 --> 14:24.646
casting directors,

14:25.591 --> 14:26.106
agents.

14:27.943 --> 14:29.034
Alice, uh,
I didn't shoot you.

14:30.946 --> 14:32.204
Oh, you didn't?

14:33.932 --> 14:35.265
But you made gun gestures
with your hands.

14:35.267 --> 14:36.699
Yeah, I'm just sending
the energy across the circle.

14:37.936 --> 14:39.786
Oh. I got it. Pow.

14:39.863 --> 14:40.787
-Whoosh.
-Whoosh.

14:40.864 --> 14:42.789
Oh! We're doing this.

14:42.866 --> 14:44.124
But... there's a twist.

14:46.445 --> 14:48.128
Only five of you
will make it to showcase.

14:48.204 --> 14:49.036
Scott:
A mall.

14:49.114 --> 14:50.222
Lindsay:
A mall, okay.

14:52.134 --> 14:53.633
(indistinct chatter)

14:55.879 --> 14:56.219
That means two of you...

14:57.289 --> 14:58.230
are not gonna make it.

15:00.308 --> 15:01.066
Spaceship.

15:03.979 --> 15:05.520
(indistinct chatter)

15:09.559 --> 15:11.076
So, tomorrow,
you're gonna meet the writers.

15:11.153 --> 15:13.637
I'd like you to, uh,
prepare a character
to audition with.

15:13.639 --> 15:17.657
The idea is
to inspire the writers
to write for you. Okay?

15:17.734 --> 15:19.993
Because why?

15:20.069 --> 15:20.585
You gotta blow away
the competition.

15:21.480 --> 15:22.245
A farm.

15:23.573 --> 15:24.038
(mimicking a farm animal)

15:25.317 --> 15:26.332
Ha-ha. Yes.

15:30.005 --> 15:33.490
Al-- Alice.
Ms. Kwan, uh...

15:33.492 --> 15:34.340
Are you just doing
'90s dance moves?

15:36.495 --> 15:36.885
I was a sprinkler.

15:38.163 --> 15:39.604
For the crops. Sir.

15:39.681 --> 15:40.096
Eh, okay.

15:41.667 --> 15:44.017
On that note, let's end there.

15:44.093 --> 15:45.777
Hey, great first day
for most of us, huh?

15:45.854 --> 15:47.279
Well done. Yes.

15:48.523 --> 15:49.948
All right,
I will see you tomorrow.

15:50.025 --> 15:53.118
Remember, you're bringing in
a character for the writers.

15:53.195 --> 15:55.770
-So make it funny.
-Magda: Okay.

15:55.847 --> 15:57.138
-Okay, great job.
-Thank you.

15:57.215 --> 15:57.363
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

16:02.779 --> 16:04.913
So... Scott is...

16:06.708 --> 16:06.915
intense.

16:08.376 --> 16:11.127
This must be where
the never-been comedians
wash up.

16:12.531 --> 16:13.805
Listen, I've done, like,
three of these programs,

16:13.882 --> 16:16.457
and unfortunately,
you gotta have to
grin and bear it.

16:16.535 --> 16:17.976
So...

16:18.053 --> 16:19.126
No, he's not that bad.

16:19.204 --> 16:21.128
-Really?
-Really?

16:21.206 --> 16:23.148
Have you not been here
the whole day with us?

16:23.225 --> 16:24.207
Okay, he's old and white.
Give him a break.

16:24.209 --> 16:24.983
No!

16:26.970 --> 16:27.477
Hey.

16:29.305 --> 16:31.397
Didn't Alice open for you
in Sacramento?

16:31.474 --> 16:33.566
Yeah, she did. I--

16:33.643 --> 16:33.992
I gave her
her first big break.

16:35.554 --> 16:37.162
She's a total newbie.

16:37.239 --> 16:37.829
Sucks that two of us
have to get cut now.

16:39.649 --> 16:40.323
Pretty sure we all know
who's going home first.

16:42.728 --> 16:45.337
Hey, should we
go grab a drink?

16:45.413 --> 16:46.412
I think we could all use one
after what we just went through.
Right?

16:46.489 --> 16:47.655
-Yeah.
-No kidding.

16:47.733 --> 16:49.733
Magda:
Margaritas?

16:49.735 --> 16:50.508
-Shaun: Oh, yes, please.
-Lindsay: Yeah.

16:50.585 --> 16:51.009
-Stacey: Yes!
-Derek: Whoo!

16:51.920 --> 16:52.961
Magda:
Or straight tequila?

16:55.073 --> 16:55.088
Lindsay:
Leave the bottle, you know.

16:56.074 --> 16:57.799
(school bell ringing)

17:02.338 --> 17:05.006
Mr. G, you aren't really
still into<i>  Minecraft?</i>

17:05.083 --> 17:07.584
Yes, I am.

17:07.586 --> 17:08.268
But someone keeps
burning down my house.

17:08.344 --> 17:09.694
I don't know
what to do.

17:09.771 --> 17:11.437
I mean, it's easy.

17:11.514 --> 17:12.422
You just combine
both flint and steel

17:12.424 --> 17:13.698
and then
you can hit 'em back.

17:13.775 --> 17:16.442
Hmm, well, then we'll
just keep going back and forth

17:16.519 --> 17:18.611
blowing up
each other's stuff
forever.

17:18.688 --> 17:20.597
And nobody wins.

17:20.599 --> 17:23.433
Like, when we all
keep tearing each other down,

17:23.435 --> 17:24.617
get expelled from class,
it just...

17:24.694 --> 17:25.618
It hurts everyone.

17:29.941 --> 17:32.033
<i>  ♪ Washing my face ♪</i>

17:32.110 --> 17:33.943

Well, well, well. Looks like
I'm not the only one
whose day sucked.

18:01.323 --> 18:02.580
Is it wine o'clock?
Hmm?

18:04.476 --> 18:05.533
-Sure. Why not?
-Yay.

18:08.980 --> 18:09.370
Do you wanna
talk about it?

18:10.832 --> 18:11.873
Nope.
What about you?

18:13.335 --> 18:15.409
Well, I suck as a teacher.

18:15.487 --> 18:17.503
It probably
doesn't matter anyway

18:17.580 --> 18:19.764
since I doubt
I'm gonna get
my third TFA year

18:19.841 --> 18:21.599
because I joined
the teachers' walk-out
and the equity committee.

18:22.844 --> 18:23.009
What happened?

18:25.254 --> 18:26.721
Have you heard
of restorative justice?

18:27.757 --> 18:29.107
Yeah.

18:29.184 --> 18:30.183
-You have?
-Yeah.

18:30.259 --> 18:31.592
Back in art school,

18:31.670 --> 18:34.337
we volunteered at this
restorative justice program

18:34.339 --> 18:34.428
for kids
who had gotten arrested.

18:36.024 --> 18:38.358
Yeah, we taught them
how to express themselves
through art

18:38.434 --> 18:38.483
instead of conflict.

18:40.269 --> 18:43.029
They loved it, um,
and most of them
stopped getting into trouble.

18:43.106 --> 18:45.123
Huh!

18:45.200 --> 18:45.448
It was actually
one of my favorite projects.

18:46.609 --> 18:49.202
What are you doing
tomorrow at 10:00?

18:49.278 --> 18:51.704
This is getting ridiculous.

18:51.781 --> 18:52.121
Who are those for?

18:53.616 --> 18:54.782
Me.

18:54.860 --> 18:56.617
What's the occasion?

18:56.695 --> 18:58.803
-It's--
-It's her birthday.

18:58.880 --> 18:59.879
Oh, my God!
Happy birthday.

18:59.956 --> 19:01.139
Happy birthday.

19:01.216 --> 19:01.622
Can't believe
it's your birthday.

19:01.700 --> 19:02.957
Thank you.

19:03.034 --> 19:05.551
(indistinct chatter)

19:05.628 --> 19:06.311
Davia:
How did we not know that?

19:09.541 --> 19:09.972
How are you feeling?

19:10.967 --> 19:11.483
I'm okay.

19:13.044 --> 19:13.434
I just want
to go home.

19:21.052 --> 19:22.327
Jerod, Jerod,
listen to me.

19:25.223 --> 19:27.499
Is there anything else
you can tell me about
the guards who hurt you?

19:27.575 --> 19:30.560
Do you mean like--
like their names?

19:30.562 --> 19:31.077
No, no, we know
their names. Um...

19:33.581 --> 19:35.064
What about
the one you hit?

19:35.066 --> 19:35.957
Deputy Gaffney.

19:38.161 --> 19:39.493
He's the one
who took my medicine.

19:39.571 --> 19:41.662
You mean the one that
didn't give you your medicine?

19:41.740 --> 19:42.013
No.

19:43.909 --> 19:45.258
The one who took it
for himself.

19:47.762 --> 19:48.302
Why would he take
your medicine for himself?

19:51.917 --> 19:52.306
I don't know.

19:56.012 --> 19:56.936
I just need to know
when I can go home.

19:58.924 --> 19:59.697
Please.

20:01.851 --> 20:02.650
What does
the big lawyer say?

20:04.429 --> 20:04.986
Can she get me
out of here?

20:08.600 --> 20:09.949
We're still working on it,
Jerod.

20:11.436 --> 20:12.043
Okay?

20:15.790 --> 20:15.955
You just need to be patient.

20:29.045 --> 20:29.218
I can't accept these.

20:30.956 --> 20:31.387
You have to stop
sending me gifts.

20:35.477 --> 20:39.386
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

20:39.464 --> 20:43.557
♪ Happy birthday,
dear Mariana ♪

20:43.635 --> 20:44.634
(door closes)

20:44.636 --> 20:46.135
Okay, I had no idea

20:46.137 --> 20:47.653
they were gonna
surprise me with a cake.

20:47.730 --> 20:49.030
Well, maybe if you hadn't lied
about it being your birthday.

20:50.233 --> 20:52.066
What was I supposed
to do?

20:52.143 --> 20:54.252
The fight club girls were here
when Evan sent the flowers,

20:54.329 --> 20:55.812
and then the balloons came.

20:55.814 --> 20:55.903
Wait, balloons?

20:57.315 --> 20:59.983
Okay, you need to talk to him.
Tell him to stop.

20:59.985 --> 21:00.917
I did.

21:02.487 --> 21:02.752
Would you like
to come in?

21:04.080 --> 21:04.754
(sighs)

21:08.326 --> 21:08.766
Sorry.

21:16.501 --> 21:17.725
Evan:
Uh, you were saying?

21:19.838 --> 21:20.945
Uh, right. Um...

21:23.008 --> 21:24.190
The gifts, they're--

21:24.267 --> 21:25.675
They're not enough
to make up

21:25.677 --> 21:25.900
for not shutting down
the app.

21:27.937 --> 21:28.277
But you should know...

21:30.682 --> 21:33.016
I've hired a group of moderators
to police the hate speech.

21:33.018 --> 21:35.126
And Speckulate is no longer
going to be promoting the app.

21:37.205 --> 21:39.297
Uh, in addition,
all the residual profits

21:39.374 --> 21:41.115
are going to be donated
to the ACLU.

21:41.192 --> 21:42.525
And all of this
should ensure that,

21:42.527 --> 21:44.293
well, the app burns itself out
within a few months.

21:46.364 --> 21:46.879
Or if not sooner.

21:48.457 --> 21:49.715
What do you think?

21:49.792 --> 21:53.719
He's doing everything
that he can to kill the app.

21:53.796 --> 21:55.480
Callie:
Yeah, everything
except shutting it down.

21:55.557 --> 21:56.648
Yeah, well, at least
he's doing something.

21:56.724 --> 21:57.306
So what did you do?

22:00.970 --> 22:01.894
Well, I think that...

22:03.973 --> 22:07.474
I would like to jump
on your trampoline.

22:07.552 --> 22:08.818
It's not like he's
technically my boss anymore.

22:13.908 --> 22:15.074
And as long as I keep
my personal and
professional life separate...

22:22.250 --> 22:23.958
it's not exactly
a conflict of interest.

22:25.070 --> 22:27.253
(both laughing)

22:27.330 --> 22:28.337
So, you didn't end it?

22:31.092 --> 22:32.258
(both laughing)

22:42.253 --> 22:43.361
(racy music playing)

22:55.266 --> 22:55.489
What are you gonna tell
the fight club girls?

22:56.768 --> 22:58.042
Nothing. Now.

23:00.196 --> 23:01.212
You know, but the second
that we get our seed money

23:01.289 --> 23:03.606
and get things
up and running,

23:03.608 --> 23:04.048
if I'm still dating Evan,
I will.

23:05.944 --> 23:06.033
I will.

23:07.536 --> 23:09.128
You realize you can't celebrate
your birthday this year?

23:11.282 --> 23:12.373
But I love my birthday.

23:12.450 --> 23:12.882
Just sayin'.

23:23.628 --> 23:24.143
What, do you live here now?

23:24.220 --> 23:25.019
My girlfriend does.

23:27.966 --> 23:29.741
How was drinks?

23:29.817 --> 23:31.634
Fine. How come
you didn't come out?

23:31.636 --> 23:32.969
I wasn't invited.

23:32.971 --> 23:34.061
I'm a "newbie."

23:34.139 --> 23:35.821
Ah. And apparently...

23:37.642 --> 23:38.240
you have
an invisibility cloak.

23:39.811 --> 23:42.236
Look, everyone knows
that I was the exception
they made.

23:42.313 --> 23:46.240
So maybe you were right.
Maybe I'm not ready.

23:46.317 --> 23:46.707
Maybe I should just quit
before I get cut.

23:48.653 --> 23:52.413
Or maybe you should
just finish what you started,

23:52.490 --> 23:53.005
instead of giving up
because you had a bad day.

23:54.492 --> 23:54.882
Isn't that what you want?

23:55.843 --> 23:56.884
No.

24:00.331 --> 24:01.681
I just didn't want
to compete with you
to get into the program.

24:01.757 --> 24:04.108
But we both got in.

24:04.185 --> 24:05.443
And now we have to compete
to stay in.

24:05.520 --> 24:06.102
Maybe.

24:07.522 --> 24:08.780
But not with each other.

24:08.856 --> 24:10.564
The only competition you're in
is with yourself.

24:13.511 --> 24:13.859
Why the heck are you being
so nice to me?

24:15.029 --> 24:17.863
Because I gave you
your big break,

24:17.940 --> 24:18.030
and I don't want you
to make me look bad.

24:21.869 --> 24:24.945
I'm supposed to just come up
with a random character
overnight?

24:25.023 --> 24:26.372
Look, I can't give you
all the answers.

24:26.449 --> 24:28.040
Some of this you're gonna
have to figure out yourself.

24:34.048 --> 24:36.257
(in British accent):
You've got a bloody croûton
on your lip.

24:38.036 --> 24:38.259
That's aggressive.

24:40.054 --> 24:40.978
It me!

24:43.708 --> 24:46.434
(phone ringing)

24:50.732 --> 24:51.147
Hey, Mom.

24:52.975 --> 24:54.108
Jean-Michel Basquiat...

24:56.054 --> 24:57.495
started off
as a graffiti artist.

24:59.741 --> 25:01.482
He had a tough time
growing up.

25:01.559 --> 25:02.283
Really felt like
the world was stacked up
against him.

25:04.062 --> 25:06.454
But he put all the stuff
that he was dealing with
into his art.

25:07.823 --> 25:08.330
I related to that because...

25:09.917 --> 25:11.459
I wasn't really good at talking
about my feelings as a kid.

25:12.403 --> 25:13.919
The more people pressed me to,

25:15.423 --> 25:16.013
the more I just shut down.

25:18.092 --> 25:20.259
And then I realized
all the stuff that
I couldn't say in words,

25:20.336 --> 25:22.019
I could say in art,
just like Basquiat.

25:23.672 --> 25:26.507
And he was very successful.

25:26.584 --> 25:28.684
By the time he was 20,
his paintings were selling
for thousands of dollars.

25:30.104 --> 25:32.088
Hmm. That's cool.

25:32.090 --> 25:32.697
Right?

25:34.776 --> 25:36.609
So, I thought
instead of our talking circle,

25:38.354 --> 25:40.321
Gael could help each of you
with some art projects.

25:41.099 --> 25:42.948
What if we can't draw?

25:43.025 --> 25:45.042
You can take pictures.

25:45.119 --> 25:45.618
You can make a movie.

25:47.272 --> 25:49.196
And everyone can draw.

25:49.274 --> 25:52.124
Art doesn't have to be hard
or intimidating.

25:52.201 --> 25:53.292
It can be just fun.

25:53.369 --> 25:56.279
So, you want us to, what,
finger paint?

25:56.281 --> 25:58.556
(chuckling)

25:58.633 --> 25:59.782
Yeah, if that's what
you wanna do.

25:59.784 --> 26:00.800
So, I brought some paint,

26:02.954 --> 26:05.304
I brought some canvases,
and some clay.

26:05.381 --> 26:07.565
-Nyah: I'll do the clay.
-Andre: I'll make a movie.

26:07.642 --> 26:09.216
-Davia: Hey!
-Hey.

26:09.294 --> 26:11.127
-What's up?
-Nothing.

26:11.129 --> 26:11.961
I was just, uh,
checking in to see
how it's going.

26:11.963 --> 26:13.738
Oh, well,
it is going great!

26:13.815 --> 26:15.222
Thank you so much
for checking in on me.

26:15.300 --> 26:15.856
-Okay, great!
-All right, awesome.
See ya later.

26:17.302 --> 26:18.067
Great.

26:21.472 --> 26:23.030
So, like,
are you a successful artist?

26:24.976 --> 26:26.417
Ugh. No, not really.

26:28.070 --> 26:28.369
You mean, not yet.

26:30.739 --> 26:31.997
Right. Not yet.

26:33.501 --> 26:37.911
I will have
a big bacon cheeseburger
with a side of...

26:37.989 --> 26:39.931
(loudly):
open your eyes, man!

26:40.007 --> 26:44.084
They're poisoning us,
and they're not even trying
to hide it!

26:44.162 --> 26:48.831
Okay, well, is that a regular
"Open your eyes," or a diet?

26:48.833 --> 26:50.666
Scott:
Ah, and scene. Great!

26:50.668 --> 26:53.519
Ha-ha, yes.
Uh, solid work.

26:53.596 --> 26:54.603
Come on down. Nice.
Nice hat, Derek.

26:56.691 --> 26:58.783
Hats are funny. Hats are funny.
Okay, who's up?

26:58.860 --> 27:01.360
Um, yeah, let-- let's do
Lindsay and Alice.

27:01.437 --> 27:01.953
Come on down.

27:04.349 --> 27:04.780
(Scott chuckles)

27:07.034 --> 27:08.292
-Man: Always very funny.
-Scott: Yeah.

27:08.369 --> 27:11.111
Okay, okay.

27:11.189 --> 27:13.631
Um, let's put you two
in a job interview.

27:13.708 --> 27:15.207
And go!

27:15.284 --> 27:17.526
So, uh, how long
you been fly-fishin'?

27:17.528 --> 27:20.120
(imitating her mother):
Never. I need job
for divorce my husband.

27:20.198 --> 27:21.714
(chuckles)

27:21.790 --> 27:23.382
-Hey, Mom--
<i>  -Your father crazy!</i>

27:23.459 --> 27:24.642
<i>  I selling makeup</i>
<i>  so I can get divorce.</i>

27:24.719 --> 27:26.886
What?

27:26.962 --> 27:30.039
-Why?
-He leave cup of water
everywhere.

27:30.041 --> 27:32.984
Kitchen table, water.
(indistinct dialogue)

27:33.060 --> 27:35.211
Nightstand, water.

27:35.213 --> 27:37.321
<i>  Mahjong table, water.</i>
<i>  Everywhere!</i>

27:37.398 --> 27:39.306
Water!

27:39.384 --> 27:41.325
You, uh, got something
against water?

27:41.402 --> 27:45.237
Ai. He also chew so loud.
Like a wood chopper.

27:45.314 --> 27:47.981
<i>  Ka-cha, ka-cha,</i>
<i>  crunch, crunch.</i>

27:48.059 --> 27:50.910
He drive me crazy!
He crunch me to die!

27:50.986 --> 27:54.005
(all laughing)

27:54.081 --> 27:56.156
I'm just looking
for somebody to sell bait.

27:56.234 --> 27:59.585
<i>  If I sell makeup,</i>
<i>  I get pink car.</i>

27:59.662 --> 28:01.587
I don't wear makeup,
I sell bait.

28:01.664 --> 28:04.407
You know, wet flies,
streamers, nymphs,
poppers.

28:04.409 --> 28:07.743
Aiya, nymphs and poppers,
you sound like gay bar.

28:07.745 --> 28:10.346
(all laughing)

28:11.599 --> 28:12.181
<i>  What about your friend?</i>

28:13.751 --> 28:15.601
<i>  She need concealer.</i>

28:15.678 --> 28:18.178
You have bag under eye.

28:18.256 --> 28:20.180
(laughs)

28:20.258 --> 28:22.274
Could use concealer.

28:22.351 --> 28:23.275
I'm not selling makeup...

28:23.352 --> 28:24.851
To my friends.

28:24.929 --> 28:26.687
<i>  I send you catalogue, okay?</i>

28:26.764 --> 28:27.613
<i>  Pass it.</i>

28:28.766 --> 28:29.040
(sighs)

28:31.936 --> 28:35.362
People want to look pretty
when fly-fishing.

28:35.440 --> 28:37.122
Attract more fish.
(speaking foreign language)

28:37.199 --> 28:39.608
I send you catalogue.

28:39.610 --> 28:41.277
Scott: Yes!
All right, and scene.

28:41.279 --> 28:43.721
-(all applauding)
-That is how you do it, huh?

28:46.542 --> 28:47.391
That was great.
Great work, Alice.

28:49.804 --> 28:53.380
Why did you tell the kids
that you weren't
a successful artist?

28:53.458 --> 28:53.806
You're a great artist.

28:54.883 --> 28:55.557
Thanks, but...

28:58.145 --> 28:59.628
I guess it just feels like

28:59.630 --> 29:02.147
I'm falling behind
a lot of my friends
from art school.

29:04.469 --> 29:05.985
After we graduated,

29:06.061 --> 29:08.579
most of them
did unpaid internships
with successful artists

29:08.656 --> 29:11.991
who... are helping
promote their careers now.

29:14.645 --> 29:16.754
So, why didn't you do that?

29:16.831 --> 29:18.589
Because I didn't have
wealthy parents,

29:18.666 --> 29:23.076
and I needed to get a job
to pay for my student loans.

29:23.154 --> 29:24.929
So, is it too late
to do that now?

29:25.006 --> 29:26.263
I mean,
if you can afford to do it?

29:31.329 --> 29:32.344
My friend does know an artist
who's looking.

29:33.922 --> 29:35.773
He works at night.

29:35.850 --> 29:36.765
I could do gig work
during the day.

29:38.836 --> 29:38.925
But just...

29:40.338 --> 29:42.113
I don't know,
it just feels like
I'm starting over.

29:44.509 --> 29:45.107
I should just be
so much further along
by now.

29:46.935 --> 29:48.027
Hey, wait.
Look. Listen.

29:49.680 --> 29:52.406
A lot of my friends from college
already have their masters.

29:53.701 --> 29:57.520
I'm doing this job
so I can get mine paid for.

29:57.522 --> 29:58.203
We're all
on our own timeline.

30:00.024 --> 30:02.583
It does not matter
how fast we get there,
just that we do.

30:05.621 --> 30:05.919
Who cares
how long it takes?

30:12.036 --> 30:13.477
So the first few months,
we'll measure how much product
is being sent back.

30:13.554 --> 30:17.222
So... does this mean
you're coming back
to Speckulate?

30:19.710 --> 30:21.986
No. The girls and I
need to be on our own
right now.

30:24.048 --> 30:25.105
Plus, uh,
we're really excited
about this idea.

30:27.051 --> 30:29.827
Gina: We can send alerts
with offers for seasonal items
like sunscreen.

30:31.814 --> 30:32.488
Mariana?

30:34.725 --> 30:35.824
-Yeah?
-Everything okay?

30:38.396 --> 30:40.412
It's called Bulk Beauty.
What do you think?

30:42.416 --> 30:42.956
I think
it's a bad idea.

30:45.494 --> 30:46.844
Wow!

30:46.921 --> 30:47.920
(sarcastically):
Don't hold back.

30:49.256 --> 30:49.838
Okay.

30:52.076 --> 30:53.759
You're coders.

30:53.836 --> 30:56.095
You have no experience
in retail,

30:56.171 --> 30:57.521
brand management,
distribution.

30:57.598 --> 30:57.746
You'd be in
way over your heads.

30:59.100 --> 31:01.917
Mariana:
<i>  Yeah. No, every--</i>
<i>  everything's fine.</i>

31:01.919 --> 31:03.268
It's just...
You know, we're coders.

31:03.345 --> 31:06.922
We don't have
any retail experience,

31:06.924 --> 31:07.531
brand management,
or distribution.

31:10.018 --> 31:11.202
So what are you suggesting?

31:11.278 --> 31:13.871
Start with something small,
generate some capital.

31:13.948 --> 31:17.116
Like, um... a game app.

31:17.192 --> 31:18.951
Maybe we start simpler,
like a game app.

31:25.793 --> 31:27.200
Something wrong?

31:27.278 --> 31:29.962
I mean, you...
kind of just crapped
all over our idea.

31:31.782 --> 31:33.224
You told me
not to hold back.

31:33.300 --> 31:34.466
I was being sarcastic.

31:35.544 --> 31:36.051
Oh.

31:39.290 --> 31:40.139
I don't get sarcasm.

31:43.127 --> 31:45.628
It's not the idea itself
that's bad.

31:45.630 --> 31:47.146
It's just--
It's too big of an idea
to start with.

31:51.636 --> 31:52.025
I'm sorry.

31:55.230 --> 31:55.913
It's okay.

31:57.399 --> 31:58.991
We're just so new at this.

31:59.067 --> 32:00.476
You know, and we need
to make money

32:00.478 --> 32:02.068
before we run through
our savings.

32:02.146 --> 32:04.163
I'm afraid that
if we start so big,
we'll fail.

32:08.669 --> 32:09.501
-That makes sense.
-Yeah.

32:11.747 --> 32:13.430
Okay.
So, we start small.

32:15.826 --> 32:15.933
What's the next
<i>  Candy Crush?</i>

32:25.260 --> 32:27.169
-Ah! Oh, I'm so sorry.
-Sorry--

32:27.171 --> 32:30.856
Oh, no, I just--
I came, like,
barreling around the corner.

32:30.933 --> 32:32.449
No, no, no. I had
my head in the clouds.
I'm so sorry.

32:32.526 --> 32:33.433
No, it's--
it's totally okay.

32:33.511 --> 32:35.602
-Here you go.
-Oh, thank you!

32:35.680 --> 32:36.862
-That's all of them.
-Yeah.

32:36.939 --> 32:39.072
Um, I'll take that.
Thanks!

32:41.109 --> 32:41.125
So, do you garden?

32:42.186 --> 32:43.294
What?

32:43.370 --> 32:44.128
You have a green thumb.

32:48.375 --> 32:49.124
-Well...
-That's good!

32:50.528 --> 32:51.585
Oh, um, listen...

32:53.864 --> 32:55.806
I'm-- I'm really sorry
if I was, um...

32:57.218 --> 32:58.033
rude earlier.

32:58.035 --> 33:00.869
Rude? No.
No, not at all.

33:00.871 --> 33:03.388
Well, I didn't mean
to shove you
out of my classroom.

33:03.465 --> 33:04.723
It wasn't a shove,
it was--

33:04.800 --> 33:08.635
It was more like a--
like a herding-type action.

33:08.713 --> 33:09.987
Like I was a stray cow or...

33:13.050 --> 33:14.325
something you had
to get on back in the barn.

33:14.401 --> 33:16.902
(laughing)

33:16.979 --> 33:18.478
That's bad.
This analogy sucks.

33:18.556 --> 33:20.072
No, no, no.
No, I-- I suck.

33:20.148 --> 33:24.150
Um... I did read
those articles you sent
on restorative justice.

33:24.228 --> 33:24.284
And I tried it with my kids,

33:26.080 --> 33:28.956
but it sort of devolved
into an unruly game
of dodgeball.

33:30.826 --> 33:33.844
Anyway, I asked my friend,
who's an artist,
to come work with the kids.

33:33.921 --> 33:34.903
Totally cheated.

33:34.905 --> 33:37.014
No. That's not ch--
Here.

33:39.001 --> 33:41.910
That's not cheating,
that's being a good teacher.

33:41.912 --> 33:46.081
A good teacher
could handle them
themselves, like you.

33:46.083 --> 33:47.933
I saw you talking to your class
about that video game.

33:49.436 --> 33:50.477
Okay, but here's the thing.

33:51.272 --> 33:52.363
I don't play<i>  Minecraft.</i>

33:53.607 --> 33:55.199
Or any video games.

33:55.276 --> 33:59.036
I just-- I watch
these influencers
on YouTube

33:59.113 --> 34:01.354
so I can act like I know
what I'm talking about.

34:01.432 --> 34:05.434
-Um, It's just a way
to connect with the kids.
-Huh!

34:05.436 --> 34:07.452
-So, I'm-- Yeah, me,
total cheater.
-Yeah.

34:07.529 --> 34:10.122
Which is not only allowed,
but sometimes necessary.

34:11.108 --> 34:11.774
-Solomon: Davia.
-Oh, God!

34:11.776 --> 34:13.942
I was looking for you.

34:13.944 --> 34:14.701
Wanted to see
if you received your email

34:14.779 --> 34:15.794
from Teach for America yet.

34:15.871 --> 34:18.055
I have not checked
my email yet today.

34:18.132 --> 34:18.280
Maybe you should.

34:21.135 --> 34:22.726
What was that about?

34:22.803 --> 34:24.728
All this being a moot point
because I'm clearly
getting fired.

34:26.624 --> 34:27.973
"We are pleased to inform you

34:28.050 --> 34:30.234
that your contract
for a third year
has been renewed"!

34:30.311 --> 34:31.885
That's fantastic!

34:31.962 --> 34:33.145
Oh, my God.
I can't believe it!

34:33.221 --> 34:34.387
Oh!

34:34.465 --> 34:35.063
We should get a drink.

34:36.133 --> 34:36.857
Uh...

34:39.728 --> 34:41.745
And a pleasure it is
to see you again so soon.

34:41.822 --> 34:43.229
I assume we're here
to wrap this up?

34:43.307 --> 34:46.825
Well, Marc, I really wish
that was why we were here,

34:46.902 --> 34:47.492
but we have a problem.

34:48.646 --> 34:51.313
Some new information
has come to light.

34:51.315 --> 34:55.150
And our client claims
that Deputy Gaffney,
the one he retaliated against--

34:55.152 --> 34:55.592
Assaulted.

34:56.821 --> 34:58.262
Sure.

34:58.339 --> 35:00.413
Anyway, apparently,

35:00.491 --> 35:03.492
the reason why our client
was not on his meds
at the time,

35:03.494 --> 35:04.051
was because Deputy Gaffney
took them.

35:05.921 --> 35:07.095
For himself, or to sell.

35:09.166 --> 35:11.016
And who would buy
anti-psychotics?

35:12.837 --> 35:14.445
Addicts.

35:14.521 --> 35:17.263
Apparently, if you mix them
with cocaine or meth,

35:17.341 --> 35:17.948
it can heighten the euphoria.

35:21.103 --> 35:23.195
Well, it's very interesting,

35:23.271 --> 35:25.438
but you have no proof
he took them, so...

35:25.516 --> 35:27.032
What we have
is a potential pattern.

35:29.186 --> 35:30.627
I, uh--
I did some digging,

35:30.704 --> 35:31.962
and apparently,
Deputy Gaffney was fired

35:32.039 --> 35:34.247
from a job
as a corrections officer
in New Mexico

35:36.284 --> 35:36.958
for suspicion of stealing
inmates' medication.

35:41.365 --> 35:42.047
She's good, isn't she?

35:43.868 --> 35:45.884
She just passed the bar.

35:45.961 --> 35:47.478
Ha! I know how to pick 'em.

35:47.554 --> 35:48.220
Marc:
Yeah.

35:50.057 --> 35:51.098
Well, suspicion isn't proof.

35:52.634 --> 35:53.225
But...

35:55.804 --> 35:56.812
Look, considering
our relationship,

35:58.232 --> 35:59.806
I'm willing
to take a little heat

35:59.884 --> 36:00.232
from the sheriff's union
on this one.

36:02.219 --> 36:03.327
Six months.
Out in three months or less.

36:05.313 --> 36:08.073
Well, Marc,
because of our relationship,

36:08.150 --> 36:13.319
I am not going to pretend
to take that offer
under consideration.

36:13.397 --> 36:14.579
Let's just cut to the chase.

36:14.656 --> 36:16.173
What is your real best offer?

36:17.826 --> 36:18.734
Bottom line.

36:18.736 --> 36:19.343
You're killing me,
Kathleen.

36:20.587 --> 36:21.661
You love it.

36:21.739 --> 36:22.679
Okay.

36:24.074 --> 36:24.589
Because it's you.

36:26.927 --> 36:28.176
Oh, I am gonna catch
major hell for this.

36:29.413 --> 36:29.636
All right.

36:31.081 --> 36:34.474
Three months,
plus time served.
Out in 30 days.

36:39.256 --> 36:40.589
Kathleen:
Thank you, Marc.

36:40.591 --> 36:43.033
I sincerely appreciate
you going out on a limb for me.

36:46.430 --> 36:47.154
But we're gonna take
this one to trial.

36:51.618 --> 36:54.119
(indistinct chatter)

36:54.196 --> 36:56.705
-How do you feel?
-About what?

36:58.292 --> 36:59.383
The fact that Alice
literally stole the scene.

37:01.779 --> 37:02.210
Guess we're all on
the chopping block now.

37:14.458 --> 37:14.731
Hey!
Your fly-fishing character
was really funny.

37:16.310 --> 37:18.794
Thanks. But the, uh,
writers didn't seem
to think so.

37:18.796 --> 37:21.646
-But you killed. Congrats.
-Thanks!

37:21.723 --> 37:23.857
You're lucky.
You have your ethnicity
to fall back on.

37:28.973 --> 37:30.581
We're going to trial?

37:30.657 --> 37:32.416
That depends on the DA.
Maybe.

37:32.493 --> 37:34.826
But that means Jerod
will be stuck
in jail for longer.

37:34.903 --> 37:36.979
Up to a year or more,
you said.

37:36.981 --> 37:37.904
We-- We could have
got him out in 30 days.

37:37.982 --> 37:38.589
With nothing!

37:40.317 --> 37:41.041
This is more than
just a trial.

37:43.078 --> 37:43.502
We have the potential
for a lawsuit.

37:45.339 --> 37:47.413
We could get the city
to settle for millions.

37:47.491 --> 37:49.841
And then we can forget
picking up PD overflow cases

37:49.918 --> 37:51.326
for a few hundred dollars
a pop.

37:51.328 --> 37:53.495
We can really expand,

37:53.497 --> 37:54.930
offer new resources
for people in need.

37:56.333 --> 37:57.924
And what about Jerod?

37:58.002 --> 38:00.502
I mean, you said
the longer he's in jail,
the worse off he'll be.

38:00.504 --> 38:02.095
But then when he gets out,

38:02.172 --> 38:05.190
he'll have money
for follow-up care
and a roof over his head.

38:05.267 --> 38:07.433
Shouldn't we at least take
the 30-day deal to Jerod?

38:07.511 --> 38:09.620
No. Absolutely not.

38:09.696 --> 38:11.513
He's going
to be short-sighted,

38:11.515 --> 38:11.646
and he's going
to want to take it.

38:13.684 --> 38:14.458
This is a win-win all around.
Trust me.

38:21.875 --> 38:22.916
(French pop music playing)

38:37.875 --> 38:39.132
Are you here
with the diamond dust?

38:39.209 --> 38:43.228
Uh, no. I--
I'm the new intern.

38:43.305 --> 38:44.396
(scoffs)
The new intern?

38:45.883 --> 38:46.231
Who are you?

38:47.809 --> 38:48.884
The new intern.

38:48.886 --> 38:50.902
-Oh, Gael, right?
-Yeah.

38:50.979 --> 38:51.328
We spoke on the phone.

38:52.890 --> 38:56.482
Gideon, mate,
thanks for your service
but you're fired.

38:56.560 --> 38:58.001
Gael, with me.

39:00.822 --> 39:01.955
Oi! Over here.

39:06.587 --> 39:08.011
So I'm doing
this new project

39:08.088 --> 39:09.329
inspired by
the aurora borealis,

39:09.406 --> 39:13.258
and I need
to channel the spirit

39:13.335 --> 39:13.758
of the early
Icelandic artists.

39:15.929 --> 39:18.188
So, whatever tools
the Norsemen used, I need.

39:20.250 --> 39:23.343
Um, well, where...
do I find the Norsemen tools?

39:23.420 --> 39:26.346
Well, if I knew that,
I wouldn't need
an intern now, would I?

39:26.423 --> 39:27.981
Right. Yeah.

39:28.926 --> 39:30.150
Right, yeah.

39:31.428 --> 39:32.110
Why are you still here?

I got my third year,

I wish you were here
to celebrate, exclamation point.

40:01.458 --> 40:01.973
A drink?

40:03.627 --> 40:05.127
Oh, uh, well--

40:05.129 --> 40:08.054
If you don't drink, we can--
Uh, we can get a coffee

40:08.132 --> 40:09.981
and a celebratory scone.

40:10.058 --> 40:11.466
No, I definitely drink.

40:11.468 --> 40:11.691
But, um...

40:13.228 --> 40:15.236
I'm kind of
seeing someone
who lives at the Coterie.

40:17.808 --> 40:20.584
I think. Um,
it's really complicated.

40:20.661 --> 40:23.069
Um, but that's just
assuming, you know,
you meant drink, drinks.

40:23.147 --> 40:26.089
Which maybe you didn't.
Maybe, you meant
co-worker drinks.

40:26.166 --> 40:27.090
And, oh, my God.
I'm totally embarrassed.

40:27.167 --> 40:28.925
You don't have to be
embarrassed.

40:31.321 --> 40:32.763
Although,
maybe I should be?

40:32.839 --> 40:34.489
-No. No.
-It's okay. It's okay.

40:34.491 --> 40:38.918
Uh, a girl like you
is not going to be single.
Clearly.

40:38.996 --> 40:40.929
Uh... whoever it is,
is a lucky guy.
