WEBVTT

00:02.885 --> 00:04.886
Whatcha got there?

00:04.887 --> 00:07.488
A candle, perfume.
Bra.

00:07.489 --> 00:09.524
Someone's dropping off
a care-package for mom.

00:09.525 --> 00:11.225
Ew. No.

00:11.226 --> 00:13.294
It's the stuff that Sophia
left at my apartment.

00:13.329 --> 00:15.930
Oh, bud.
Oh, bud.

00:15.931 --> 00:17.365
Breakups are the worst.

00:17.366 --> 00:18.967
Man, I just want to
walk up to Sophia,

00:18.968 --> 00:21.169
slap her in the face
and say, "Girl, you messed up."

00:21.203 --> 00:22.670
<i>(Terry) You need to destroy
that stuff.</i>

00:22.671 --> 00:24.038
You want me to crush
that big box

00:24.039 --> 00:25.273
into a little ball
with my bare hands?

00:25.274 --> 00:26.507
No.

00:26.508 --> 00:28.509
I'm gonna text Sophia
and give her her stuff back.

00:28.510 --> 00:29.644
That way I'll get
to see her again

00:29.645 --> 00:31.312
and hopefully smell
the air around her hair.

00:31.313 --> 00:33.214
That'll make me feel better.
No, no, no, no, no.

00:33.248 --> 00:34.649
Okay, you need to
embrace the pain

00:34.650 --> 00:35.683
so you can get through it.

00:35.684 --> 00:37.185
You need catharsis.

00:37.186 --> 00:39.520
Sarge is right.
You need to cathart.

00:39.521 --> 00:41.689
Cathart your brains out.

00:41.690 --> 00:42.890
Cathart all over the place.

00:42.891 --> 00:43.992
That is a great point, guys.

00:43.993 --> 00:45.026
Thank you.

00:45.027 --> 00:46.027
You know who'd
appreciate that a lot

00:46.028 --> 00:47.462
is Sophia, I'm gonna text her.

00:47.496 --> 00:49.364
I'm gonna take
that phone now, Jake.

00:49.365 --> 00:50.932
I'd like to see you try.

00:50.933 --> 00:52.700
Well, you did that very easily.

00:52.701 --> 00:53.868
Look, I understand
that you're trying

00:53.869 --> 00:55.503
to help, but I promise you,
the best thing for me

00:55.504 --> 00:57.138
right now is to text Sophia.

00:57.139 --> 00:58.473
Give me my phone?

00:58.474 --> 01:01.909
Okay.
Thank you.

01:01.910 --> 01:04.979
And... send.

01:04.980 --> 01:06.214
Why hasn't she written back yet?

01:06.215 --> 01:08.182
Uh, this feels terrible.

01:08.183 --> 01:09.183
You two could have stopped this,

01:09.184 --> 01:11.149
but you didn't, you monsters.

<i>(Charles) Hey.</i>

01:32.975 --> 01:35.109
Any idea what this
emergency meeting is about?

01:35.144 --> 01:36.611
Probably about how
all the cell towers

01:36.612 --> 01:38.279
in the city are broken,
and that's why Sophia

01:38.280 --> 01:39.347
hasn't texted me back.

01:39.348 --> 01:41.716
I keep checking my phone
every three seconds, like a loser.

01:41.717 --> 01:43.551
Tread lightly, son.

01:43.552 --> 01:44.552
Jacob...

01:44.553 --> 01:45.920
Have you done
any of the catharting

01:45.921 --> 01:47.488
exercises I gave you?

01:47.489 --> 01:51.092
Well, I don't own a bathtub, so
the first two pages are out.

01:51.093 --> 01:52.293
And it's the middle of winter,

01:52.294 --> 01:54.295
so where would
I dance in a fountain?

01:54.329 --> 01:56.431
Indoor malls, Jake.
Indoor malls.

01:56.465 --> 01:58.132
All right, squad.

01:58.133 --> 02:00.301
Evry year, the Department
of Homeland Security

02:00.302 --> 02:03.337
runs a multi-agency
counter-terrorism drill.

02:03.338 --> 02:04.972
<i>The team from the DOD</i>

02:04.973 --> 02:06.641
had to drop out
at the last minute.

02:06.675 --> 02:08.042
<i>Thanks to our stellar scores</i>

02:08.043 --> 02:09.610
at last year's
tactical village...

02:09.645 --> 02:12.380
Nine-nine!

02:12.381 --> 02:14.649
They want us to fill in.

02:14.683 --> 02:17.885
<i>We are the only
non-federal</i> agency

02:17.886 --> 02:19.954
ever invited to this event.

02:19.955 --> 02:23.624
This is a huge opportunity
and we are going to nail it!

02:23.625 --> 02:24.624
Nine-nine!

02:24.626 --> 02:27.094
All: Yeah!

02:27.095 --> 02:28.162
Charles?
Yeah?

02:28.163 --> 02:29.163
You know what I'm thinking?

02:29.164 --> 02:30.498
Yes, we should
pack grapes for the road.

02:30.499 --> 02:31.833
No.

02:31.834 --> 02:33.134
This drill couldn't
have come at a better time.

02:33.135 --> 02:34.302
I'm gonna throw myself into it

02:34.303 --> 02:36.037
and focus solely
on getting a win,

02:36.038 --> 02:38.005
and not whether or not
Sophia's texted me back.

02:38.006 --> 02:39.774
Which she hasn't,
in case anyone was wondering.

02:39.775 --> 02:40.774
Nine-nine!

02:40.776 --> 02:42.276
All: Yeah!
Nine-nine!

02:42.277 --> 02:43.777
I don't get it.

02:44.713 --> 02:45.780
Santiago, Diaz.

02:45.814 --> 02:47.715
Before you go,
both of you requested

02:47.716 --> 02:49.750
to have this Saturday off,
but I need one of you to work.

02:49.785 --> 02:50.905
Oh, I could take that shift.

02:50.919 --> 02:52.186
Well, last time
you worked a Saturday,

02:52.187 --> 02:53.788
you watched cartoons
the entire time.

02:53.822 --> 02:55.156
Well, that's when they're on.

02:55.190 --> 02:58.459
Work this out
and get back to me.

02:58.460 --> 03:00.361
Sorry.
I can't reschedule.

03:00.362 --> 03:01.696
I have tickets to a TED Talk

03:01.697 --> 03:03.531
on power poses
and getting what you want

03:03.532 --> 03:05.366
by using your body.

03:05.367 --> 03:06.467
Uh-oh.

03:06.468 --> 03:07.802
I hope it doesn't get
too sexual.

03:07.803 --> 03:09.036
"Uh-oh, I hope it
doesn't get too sexual."

03:09.037 --> 03:10.137
Title of your sex tape.

03:10.138 --> 03:11.739
But seriously,
what is taking so long?

03:11.740 --> 03:13.040
Also the title of your sex tape.

03:13.041 --> 03:14.642
Well, I have plans
on Saturday too.

03:14.643 --> 03:15.910
I'm having dinner
with my parents.

03:15.944 --> 03:17.111
So?

03:17.112 --> 03:18.613
You don't even like
your parents.

03:18.614 --> 03:21.148
You call them smiley
morons and hug freaks.

03:21.149 --> 03:23.383
Plans are plans, I'm
a badass, not an anarchist.

03:23.385 --> 03:24.552
I don't buy it.

03:24.553 --> 03:26.921
You know, if you told me
what you were really doing,

03:26.922 --> 03:28.756
I'd consider changing my plans.

03:28.757 --> 03:33.194
But you didn't
so I'm getting Saturday off.

03:33.195 --> 03:34.562
Are you trying to power pose me?

03:34.563 --> 03:35.763
I don't know.

03:35.764 --> 03:36.831
Maybe I'm supposed to be
sitting in a chair.

03:36.832 --> 03:38.399
This is why
I need to see the talk!

03:40.636 --> 03:43.738
Captain, is the entire squad
at this dumb field trip?

03:43.772 --> 03:44.872
Yes, they are.

03:44.873 --> 03:45.873
Is there a problem?

03:45.874 --> 03:47.642
Uh, yeah.

03:47.643 --> 03:50.111
You know how I've been
defying all expectations

03:50.112 --> 03:51.379
by going back to school?

03:51.413 --> 03:53.214
I always knew you had it in you.

03:53.215 --> 03:55.182
Can't you just be
blown away by me?

03:55.183 --> 03:56.317
I need someone to take

03:56.351 --> 03:59.120
this personality test
for my Psych class.

03:59.121 --> 04:00.821
I was hoping to wow my professor

04:00.822 --> 04:04.258
with a genuine psycho like Amy,

04:04.259 --> 04:06.861
or Hitchcock, or Charles
would be great.

04:06.862 --> 04:09.196
I'm not a psycho,
but I could take your test.

04:09.231 --> 04:11.065
That would be awesome.

04:11.066 --> 04:13.034
I do need to warn you
that the results

04:13.035 --> 04:15.937
can be... a little unflattering.

04:15.938 --> 04:19.707
It's okay, I'm no stranger
to unflattering test results.

04:19.708 --> 04:21.742
Your blood pressure's normal.

04:21.743 --> 04:23.978
Normal?
Take it again.

04:23.979 --> 04:26.080
I'm not afraid
to have my flaws exposed.

04:26.081 --> 04:28.182
But just to be clear,
though, it is possible

04:28.183 --> 04:31.085
to get a result
that shows no flaws?

04:31.086 --> 04:33.254
I guess.
Good.

04:33.255 --> 04:35.562
Good.
Can't wait to begin.

04:37.459 --> 04:38.626
Sophia text you?

04:38.660 --> 04:40.461
No, it's just a lightly
racist email forward

04:40.462 --> 04:42.096
from my Grandma.

04:42.097 --> 04:43.197
But it doesn't matter.

04:43.232 --> 04:45.032
It's time to cathart.
Check it out.

04:45.033 --> 04:46.300
Windbreaker city.

04:46.301 --> 04:50.104
ATF, Marshals,
ICE, FBI, Homeland Security.

04:50.138 --> 04:51.539
Welcome to the big leagues,
Boyle.

04:51.573 --> 04:52.673
Oh, say that again.

04:52.674 --> 04:54.175
I want to record it
and use it as my ringtone.

04:54.209 --> 04:55.209
Eh.

04:55.210 --> 04:56.510
Hey, there.

04:56.511 --> 04:58.746
Jake Peralta, NYPD.
Pleasure to meet a colleague.

04:58.780 --> 05:01.916
Colleague?
Dude, read the jacket.

05:01.917 --> 05:04.151
Homeland.
We're not on the same level.

05:04.152 --> 05:05.987
Wow.
That was incredibly rude.

05:06.021 --> 05:07.054
No, no, no, no.

05:07.055 --> 05:08.189
I've always admired people

05:08.190 --> 05:09.590
who decided what
they wanted to be

05:09.591 --> 05:11.959
when they were six years old
and never waivered.

05:11.960 --> 05:14.595
Bus drivers, ice cream men.

05:14.596 --> 05:15.595
Princesses.

05:15.597 --> 05:18.599
So when exactly did you decide
you wanted to be a butt?

05:18.600 --> 05:21.002
Was it college?
Law school.

05:21.003 --> 05:23.137
Just wanted to let you know
that I went to law school.

05:23.138 --> 05:25.306
At Butt University?

05:25.307 --> 05:26.874
What are you doing?

05:26.875 --> 05:28.409
I'm standing up for us.

05:28.410 --> 05:29.944
Don't worry about it,
that guy doesn't matter.

05:29.945 --> 05:31.979
<i>All right.
Everybody, take their seats.</i>

05:31.980 --> 05:34.582
My name is Agent Kendrick,
Homeland Security.

05:34.583 --> 05:35.916
And I am in charge here.

05:35.951 --> 05:37.852
Sarge, I was wrong.
He totally matters.

05:37.886 --> 05:39.453
This year's scenario.

05:39.454 --> 05:41.155
Terrorists have stormed
the Capital Trust

05:41.156 --> 05:43.691
bank building and have
taken hostages.

05:43.725 --> 05:44.959
Noice!

05:44.960 --> 05:46.227
Oh, cool trick.

05:46.228 --> 05:49.263
I don't have a ton of free
time to practice high-fiving.

05:49.298 --> 05:50.865
You just made fun
of us for that.

05:50.866 --> 05:53.067
For practicing, that's
the first time we ever tried it.

05:53.101 --> 05:54.735
Here are your assignments.

05:54.736 --> 05:56.904
ATF, you will be our terrorists.

05:56.939 --> 05:58.172
Ooh, that's a rough draw.

05:58.173 --> 06:00.941
Homeland Security, you are
Command Control.

06:00.976 --> 06:03.177
Marshals, Strike Team Alpha.

06:03.211 --> 06:04.578
And NYPD?

06:04.579 --> 06:06.814
Helicopter snipers,
helicopter snipers.

06:06.815 --> 06:09.617
Says here you will be
our hostages.

06:09.618 --> 06:10.751
What?

06:10.752 --> 06:12.019
So you just want us
to lie on the ground

06:12.020 --> 06:13.487
and do nothing, like a bunch
of losers?

06:13.522 --> 06:14.956
Yes, precisely.

06:14.957 --> 06:17.925
No.
Jackpot.

06:21.557 --> 06:22.757
Can you leave me
some wiggle room

06:22.758 --> 06:24.425
so I can check
my phone periodically?

06:24.426 --> 06:26.294
Why? Waiting for your mom
to text?

06:26.328 --> 06:28.763
No, actually, I'm waiting
for a girl who broke up

06:28.764 --> 06:29.931
with me to text.

06:29.932 --> 06:32.767
That's way worse.
Yeah, it's bad.

06:32.768 --> 06:33.768
This sucks.

06:33.802 --> 06:35.436
I just got dumped by a mega-fox

06:35.437 --> 06:37.338
and no one's letting me
shoot a big gun about it.

06:37.339 --> 06:38.840
All right, you know what?
Screw this.

06:38.841 --> 06:40.975
I'm not gonna just sit
here like a loser.

06:40.976 --> 06:42.277
Boyle, free me,
then I'll free you.

06:42.278 --> 06:43.278
We're fighting back.

06:43.279 --> 06:44.379
No, Jake.

06:44.380 --> 06:46.781
We are behaving so we can
be invited again next year.

06:46.816 --> 06:50.852
Sarge, with all due respect,
I am going to completely ignore

06:50.853 --> 06:51.853
everything you just said.

06:51.854 --> 06:52.987
Okay, Charles.

06:53.022 --> 06:55.023
Our hands are tied so we're
gonna have to use our mouth.

06:55.024 --> 06:56.024
Smart.

06:56.025 --> 06:57.025
Wet the tape down with my saliva

06:57.026 --> 06:58.059
until you could slip right out.

06:58.093 --> 07:00.662
No, bite it.
Obviously, bite it.

07:00.663 --> 07:02.931
I don't like it.
Something stinks.

07:02.932 --> 07:04.098
Well, I'm sorry.

07:04.099 --> 07:06.067
But I refuse to mask
my natural musk

07:06.068 --> 07:07.297
with a bunch of chemicals.

07:07.303 --> 07:10.438
Uh, I was talking to Rosa
about her "dinner"

07:10.439 --> 07:12.073
with her "parents."

07:12.074 --> 07:14.209
I am having dinner
with my parents.

07:14.210 --> 07:15.677
Okay, liar.

07:15.678 --> 07:17.045
What restaurant
are you going to?

07:17.079 --> 07:18.713
I don't know,
some Italian place.

07:18.748 --> 07:22.584
Oh, Italian?
Makes sense, Pinocchio.

07:22.585 --> 07:24.986
He's a liar too, and Italian.

07:24.987 --> 07:27.122
I over explained it.

07:27.123 --> 07:28.556
<i>(Gina) Okay, last question.</i>

07:28.557 --> 07:30.925
What body of water
do you most identify with?

07:30.926 --> 07:33.695
A, lake, B, river, C, ocean.

07:33.696 --> 07:36.231
Oh, they can't be serious.
Of course I choose ocean.

07:36.265 --> 07:37.465
I hate the ocean.

07:37.466 --> 07:40.301
That's where that stuck-up
bitch Rose let Leo die.

07:40.302 --> 07:43.338
There was plenty of room
on that door.

07:43.339 --> 07:46.174
Okay, the computer
is tabulating.

07:46.175 --> 07:47.809
<i>Ohh.</i>

07:47.810 --> 07:50.245
You got category I9 C3 G6.

07:50.279 --> 07:54.382
I9 C3 G6.
Is that as good as it sounds?

07:54.417 --> 07:56.017
You have a robust sense of self

07:56.018 --> 07:58.086
and are well suited
to leadership positions.

07:58.087 --> 08:02.557
Characteristics... strength,
determination, tenacity.

08:02.558 --> 08:04.159
Yes, I suppose that's accurate.

08:04.160 --> 08:07.128
They do call me Tenacious Ray
down at the country club.

08:07.129 --> 08:08.196
Because for the past 10 years,

08:08.197 --> 08:10.198
I've been suing them
for discrimination.

08:10.199 --> 08:12.133
I'm very pleased
with this assessment.

08:12.168 --> 08:13.435
You should be.

08:13.436 --> 08:18.073
I took the test too
and I also got an I9 C3 G6.

08:18.074 --> 08:19.908
What?

08:19.909 --> 08:21.176
We got the same score?

08:21.177 --> 08:23.712
It's just crazy
how accurate this thing is.

08:23.713 --> 08:26.414
Yes.
Crazy.

08:26.415 --> 08:28.550
All right, Sarge.
Now to cut you loose.

08:28.584 --> 08:30.518
No, I'm staying tied up.

08:30.519 --> 08:32.587
I don't care how much
of a jerk Kendrick is.

08:32.587 --> 08:34.422
I want it to be clear
I had no part in this.

08:34.457 --> 08:37.058
No offense, but you are
a huge waste of muscles.

08:37.092 --> 08:38.226
<i>Okay, Boyle.</i>

08:38.227 --> 08:39.394
There's two guards
outside this door.

08:39.395 --> 08:41.029
We need their guns.
You know what to do.

08:41.030 --> 08:42.163
Beat 'em up?

08:42.164 --> 08:43.265
Pretend to be sick
and lure them in here.

08:43.299 --> 08:44.310
Right.
The Charles.

08:44.333 --> 08:45.867
Here we go.

08:45.868 --> 08:46.868
<i>Help!</i>

08:46.869 --> 08:48.904
I need help.
I'm sick.

08:48.938 --> 08:50.805
<i>Is this part of the drill?
What's wrong?</i>

08:50.840 --> 08:52.474
I have Seasonal
Affective Disorder.

08:52.475 --> 08:53.675
What?

08:53.676 --> 08:54.843
It's a serious condition
that affects millions

08:54.844 --> 08:57.479
of Americans.

08:57.480 --> 09:00.916
What the hell?

09:00.917 --> 09:03.385
We're fighting back,
you terrorist crap sack.

09:03.419 --> 09:06.488
Also, thank you
for including us in this event.

09:06.489 --> 09:07.956
<i>(Jake) You got a partner
outside, right?</i>

09:07.957 --> 09:09.791
Call him in here.

09:09.792 --> 09:11.593
I need help!

09:11.594 --> 09:13.495
[gun shot]

09:13.496 --> 09:14.496
Ow.

09:14.497 --> 09:15.997
Shh.
You're dead.

09:15.998 --> 09:17.432
See you later, losers.

09:17.433 --> 09:19.401
Again, opportunity
of a lifetime.

09:19.402 --> 09:21.636
Just a real positive experience.

09:25.942 --> 09:27.242
All right,
we need to distract them.

09:27.243 --> 09:28.577
Do you have anything
I can throw?

09:28.578 --> 09:29.578
I have a dog tag.

09:29.579 --> 09:31.680
Oh, that is bad ass, Boyle.

09:31.681 --> 09:33.582
No... it's an actual tag
for a dog.

09:33.583 --> 09:34.749
Yep.
Molly.

09:34.750 --> 09:36.384
She was my poodle growing up.

09:36.385 --> 09:37.719
Never forget your first.

09:37.720 --> 09:38.887
Your first what?

09:38.888 --> 09:39.888
Dog.

09:39.889 --> 09:42.657
That is never
what people mean by that.

09:47.997 --> 09:50.365
When you get to hell,
say hi to Molly.

09:50.366 --> 09:52.300
What?
Why is Molly in hell?

09:52.335 --> 09:54.035
Cause it sounds cooler
than heaven.

09:54.036 --> 09:55.370
Hiyah!
Both: Aah!

09:55.371 --> 09:56.838
Door kick.
What's up, dude?

09:56.839 --> 09:58.340
Is it lunch time?
Is the drill over?

09:58.374 --> 09:59.875
We're freeing you guys.

09:59.876 --> 10:01.843
Jake, can you hear me?
Is it lunch time?

10:01.844 --> 10:04.346
No, it's not lunch time.
It's 10:30 in the morning.

10:04.380 --> 10:05.547
No wonder I was starving.

10:05.581 --> 10:07.182
Look, we came here to win

10:07.183 --> 10:08.583
and they're not even
giving us a chance.

10:08.618 --> 10:09.617
<i>I think it's fair to say</i>

10:09.619 --> 10:10.852
that no one in the history
of America

10:10.853 --> 10:12.320
has been discriminated
against more.

10:12.321 --> 10:14.423
Buddy. Yeah, that's my B.
Adrenaline talking.

10:14.424 --> 10:15.824
So you guys in?
I don't know.

10:15.825 --> 10:16.792
I don't want to get in trouble.

10:16.826 --> 10:18.527
Oh, wow.
You sound like a real Terry.

10:18.528 --> 10:19.661
Why don't you just
take your shirt off

10:19.662 --> 10:20.896
and make your pecs
bounce around?

10:20.897 --> 10:22.116
Again, the adrenaline.
Don't sue me.

10:22.131 --> 10:23.432
Look, you two are still
arguing about

10:23.433 --> 10:25.767
who gets Saturday off, right?

10:25.768 --> 10:27.636
Highest body count wins.
Done.

10:27.637 --> 10:29.371
I'm gonna vape you
like my e-cig.

10:29.372 --> 10:31.039
Okay, you basically just lost.

10:31.040 --> 10:35.477
Nine-nine, we are
hostages no longer.

10:35.478 --> 10:37.779
You know, I really meant
to rip off the whole thing,

10:37.780 --> 10:39.481
but I say we go with it!

10:39.482 --> 10:41.416
Come with me, hos!

10:45.191 --> 10:46.955
2-1, Diaz.

10:52.895 --> 10:54.563
4-2, Santiago.

10:54.597 --> 10:55.897
Jake, this is great.

10:55.898 --> 10:58.066
I shot a guy in the face.
He is so mad at me.

10:58.101 --> 10:59.201
Nice.

10:59.202 --> 11:00.268
All right, this hallway
is clear.

11:00.269 --> 11:01.303
I think we killed them all.

11:01.304 --> 11:02.704
It's a regular paint bath.

11:02.739 --> 11:05.407
Like bubble bath.
No, like blood bath.

11:05.408 --> 11:07.676
All right, meet in the basement.
Here we go!

11:07.677 --> 11:09.311
Hyah!

11:09.312 --> 11:12.381
Okay, me and Boyle
took down six.

11:12.382 --> 11:14.549
Rosa and Amy got 14.

11:14.550 --> 11:15.549
Hitchcock and Scully?

11:15.551 --> 11:17.019
Were killed immediately.

11:17.020 --> 11:18.286
Yeah, we're dead.

11:18.287 --> 11:20.956
We also disarmed
and captured all these guys,

11:20.957 --> 11:22.591
so is that all the terrorists?

11:22.592 --> 11:23.592
<i>Not quite.</i>

11:23.593 --> 11:24.760
Drop your weapons, everybody.

11:24.761 --> 11:26.695
Drop them right now.
It's over.

11:26.696 --> 11:28.096
You lost.

11:28.097 --> 11:30.365
Drop them now or...

11:30.366 --> 11:31.644
You're dead, crap sack.

11:31.668 --> 11:33.268
All right, Sarge!

11:33.269 --> 11:34.647
You decided to be cool.

11:34.671 --> 11:36.204
I'm always cool.

11:36.205 --> 11:37.739
I also couldn't spend
another second

11:37.740 --> 11:40.409
listening to those ATF
wads bitch and moan.

11:40.410 --> 11:43.578
Leave it to the NYPD
to screw up being hostages.

11:43.579 --> 11:45.747
I thought cops loved to sit
around on their fat asses

11:45.748 --> 11:46.748
all day and do nothing.

11:46.749 --> 11:48.984
That's it.

11:48.985 --> 11:49.985
Whoa!

11:49.986 --> 11:51.753
My ass is not fat!

11:51.754 --> 11:54.623
Kinda sounds like it was just
about your weight issues.

11:54.624 --> 11:56.458
I'm not gonna lie,
that did strike a chord.

11:56.459 --> 11:59.161
But I also didn't like the stuff
they were saying about us.

11:59.162 --> 12:00.929
Look, I'm proud to be a cop.

12:00.930 --> 12:03.031
This drill is over.
Let's get the hell outta here.

12:03.032 --> 12:04.566
Drinks on me!
Nine-nine!

12:04.567 --> 12:06.768
All: Yeah!
Oh, my God, it worked.

12:06.769 --> 12:09.037
Let's go.

12:09.038 --> 12:10.038
And nothing from Sophia.

12:10.039 --> 12:11.239
Uh, whoa, whoa, whoa.

12:11.240 --> 12:14.343
Um, we're not quite
finished yet.

12:14.344 --> 12:17.646
I know I, for one,
am not done kicking bootay.

12:17.647 --> 12:18.981
Dude, there's no more
terrorists.

12:18.982 --> 12:21.116
No, but there's more
catharting to do.

12:21.117 --> 12:23.619
We can make everyone
regret ever taping us

12:23.620 --> 12:25.053
to chairs in the first place.

12:25.054 --> 12:26.421
Sarge?

12:26.422 --> 12:28.123
It seems unnecessary
to piss everyone off.

12:28.157 --> 12:30.659
I heard one of the Marshals
call you jiggly Jeffords.

12:30.693 --> 12:32.895
What?
Give me another clip.

12:32.896 --> 12:34.496
Now we're talking.
You two are tied, right?

12:34.497 --> 12:35.898
Both: Yeah.

12:35.899 --> 12:37.132
Settle that score.
Jake, what do you say?

12:37.133 --> 12:38.267
Want to go after the Marshals?

12:38.268 --> 12:39.768
And this butt from Homeland?

12:39.769 --> 12:41.069
Get yourself a real win?

12:41.104 --> 12:43.405
I don't know, Boyle.
I mean, they're the good guys.

12:43.406 --> 12:47.342
And that would make us...
the bad guys.

12:47.343 --> 12:48.343
Noice.

12:48.344 --> 12:50.279
So you're in?
Oh, I'm in.

12:50.280 --> 12:52.114
I'm in all the way to hell.

12:52.115 --> 12:55.551
And when I get there,
I'm gonna see your dog, Molly.

12:55.552 --> 12:56.785
Let's go, squad.

12:56.786 --> 12:58.453
That was really unnecessary.

12:59.909 --> 13:02.093
<i>(Terry) Jake, come outside.
I've got Kendrick here.</i>

13:02.094 --> 13:04.544
Peralta, what are you doing?

13:04.545 --> 13:06.906
You're NYPD, you're supposed
to be hostages.

13:06.914 --> 13:08.248
Supposed to be.

13:08.249 --> 13:10.416
But we rose up
and took down the terrorists.

13:10.451 --> 13:12.552
That's right.
We're the bad guys now.

13:12.553 --> 13:14.387
Is this some sort
of game to you?

13:14.388 --> 13:16.022
Does this sound like a game?

13:16.056 --> 13:18.891
I am a terrorist leader.
My name is Francis Gruber.

13:18.892 --> 13:20.960
My brother, Hans,
died at Nakatomi Tower

13:20.961 --> 13:22.395
at the hands of John McClane.

13:22.396 --> 13:24.764
Also, I'm related to Jeremy
Irons from the third one.

13:24.765 --> 13:26.566
Okay, so it is a game.

13:26.567 --> 13:29.435
Well, I'm not playing.
Drill's over.

13:29.436 --> 13:32.138
Drill's over, boys.
Yeah, that sounds right.

13:32.139 --> 13:33.806
We're not on the same level.

13:33.807 --> 13:36.401
And apparently, you're at
the level that can't handle us.

13:39.013 --> 13:40.947
You trying to goad me, Peralta?

13:40.948 --> 13:42.415
'Cause I'm in charge here
and I don't have

13:42.416 --> 13:45.184
to engage with mall cops.

13:45.185 --> 13:46.419
But I will.

13:46.420 --> 13:48.288
Say it, don't spray it.

13:48.289 --> 13:50.523
I'm in.
What are your demands?

13:50.524 --> 13:52.058
A guarantee that this
drill doesn't end

13:52.059 --> 13:53.726
until one of us is dead.

13:53.727 --> 13:56.896
Also, one large pizza
with fennel sausage.

13:56.897 --> 13:58.898
Brick oven,
otherwise it's sog city.

13:58.899 --> 14:00.466
And Scully needs some Gas-o-nex.

14:00.467 --> 14:01.501
Extra strength.

14:01.502 --> 14:02.669
<i>(Scully) Chewable!</i>

14:02.670 --> 14:06.472
Okay, so a fight to the death,
pizza and Gas-o-nex.

14:06.473 --> 14:07.674
<i>(Scully) Chewable!</i>

14:07.708 --> 14:09.742
You have 30 minutes
to meet our demands.

14:09.743 --> 14:12.555
After that, we paint ball
a hostage every 15 minutes.

14:12.579 --> 14:14.347
Got yourself a deal, Gruber.

14:14.381 --> 14:17.016
Get us those demands.
We'll be waiting.

14:17.017 --> 14:18.351
We're not waiting one second.

14:18.385 --> 14:19.986
Those demands were a ruse.

14:20.020 --> 14:22.488
They were?
I really need that Gas-o-nex.

14:22.489 --> 14:24.023
I think there was some
dairy in the cheesecake

14:24.024 --> 14:25.224
that I ate for breakfast.

14:25.225 --> 14:27.460
We're not gonna hang around
like sitting ducks.

14:27.461 --> 14:28.988
We're gonna take
the fight to them.

14:28.996 --> 14:30.630
Like some waddling ducks!

14:30.631 --> 14:32.765
If the waddling was
super fast and cool.

14:32.800 --> 14:34.300
Like some boss-ass penguins.

14:34.301 --> 14:35.568
Yes!

14:35.569 --> 14:37.337
I'm so glad you're back
on our side, Sarge.

14:37.371 --> 14:40.073
Okay, let's destroy
some good guys.

14:41.475 --> 14:43.509
Gina, I was outside on business
and I purchased

14:43.510 --> 14:45.345
a box of assorted sweet treats.

14:45.346 --> 14:46.479
I give you the first pick.

14:46.513 --> 14:48.748
Don't mind if I do.

14:48.749 --> 14:49.982
Curious.

14:49.983 --> 14:51.984
On your personality test,
you said your favorite shape

14:51.985 --> 14:53.152
was a square.

14:53.153 --> 14:54.153
And yet now, when you're given

14:54.154 --> 14:56.122
a choice between round cookies

14:56.123 --> 14:59.258
and square blondies,
you opt for the cookie.

14:59.259 --> 15:00.827
You opt for the circle.

15:00.861 --> 15:02.495
Yes, but it's not about shapes.

15:02.496 --> 15:05.331
I'm choosing a cookie
over a Blondie.

15:05.332 --> 15:07.600
I'm whimsical,
but I'm not a lunatic.

15:07.634 --> 15:10.470
For butter, eggs, flour,
sugar, baking soda,

15:10.471 --> 15:12.338
chocolate, salt, vanilla.

15:12.339 --> 15:14.574
The basic building blocks
are identical.

15:14.575 --> 15:19.479
The only salient difference...
they're shape.

15:19.480 --> 15:23.049
You're trying to get me
bumped out of I9 C3 G6.

15:23.050 --> 15:25.818
You don't like that the test
put us in the same category.

15:25.819 --> 15:27.387
<i>That is so rude.</i>

15:27.421 --> 15:28.988
Do you know how many
basic bitches

15:28.989 --> 15:31.858
would kill to have
the same personality as me?

15:31.892 --> 15:35.228
Gina, you know I appreciate
you but you have to admit,

15:35.229 --> 15:36.896
we're not exactly cut
from the same cloth.

15:36.897 --> 15:38.331
Apparently not.

15:38.332 --> 15:40.133
I, of course, am an exotic silk,

15:40.134 --> 15:42.635
whereas you, sir,
are snake skin.

15:42.636 --> 15:46.139
So you can keep your box
of deception and leave me alone.

15:46.173 --> 15:50.276
It's a box of shapes
and it contains only...

15:50.277 --> 15:51.611
the truth.

15:54.415 --> 15:56.482
Fennel sausage.
Jake, they did it!

15:56.517 --> 15:58.684
Balcony's over there.

16:03.090 --> 16:04.991
How many are out there?

16:04.992 --> 16:06.893
Six Marshals.
We're pinned down.

16:06.894 --> 16:11.064
Great, it's over
and we're still tied, 8-8.

16:11.065 --> 16:12.064
What the hell?

16:12.066 --> 16:14.000
9-8.
Saturday's mine.

16:14.001 --> 16:16.102
You said body count,
you didn't say whose body.

16:16.103 --> 16:17.103
Boom!

16:17.104 --> 16:18.805
Power pose.

16:18.806 --> 16:19.806
Ahh!

16:30.684 --> 16:35.683
They got me.
I'm dead too.

16:35.956 --> 16:39.625
Kendrick?
Come out!

16:39.626 --> 16:43.296
It's just you and me.

16:43.297 --> 16:45.431
Okay, okay.
I'm outta ammo.

16:45.432 --> 16:46.431
Be cool.

16:46.433 --> 16:48.935
Well, well, well.
Hello, agent.

16:48.969 --> 16:50.203
You don't actually
have to shoot me.

16:50.204 --> 16:51.504
We can just say that you won.

16:51.538 --> 16:52.905
But I want to shoot you.

16:52.940 --> 16:54.941
No way this is brick oven.

16:54.942 --> 16:56.943
They were playing us, Jake!

16:56.944 --> 16:58.244
Right, you're having a moment.

16:58.245 --> 17:00.546
So.
Any last words?

17:00.547 --> 17:01.914
Just don't shoot me in the face.

17:01.915 --> 17:04.282
I got a date tonight.
I don't want it to puff up.

17:04.284 --> 17:06.618
I'm already 10 pounds heavier
than the picture she saw.

17:06.619 --> 17:08.287
Okay.

17:08.288 --> 17:10.490
Just to clarify,
those are your last words?

17:10.491 --> 17:12.023
Because I'm about to shoot you.

17:12.025 --> 17:14.292
Ow!
What?

17:14.294 --> 17:17.029
No!
[chuckles]

17:17.030 --> 17:18.664
Gun taped to the back.

17:18.665 --> 17:21.733
All these Die Hard
references gave me the idea.

17:21.734 --> 17:24.337
I got John McClane-d.

17:24.338 --> 17:27.502
That is so much worse
than any paint ball.

17:29.491 --> 17:30.625
Interesting tactic, detectives.

17:30.626 --> 17:32.326
Show up at your first
inter-agency drill

17:32.327 --> 17:33.694
and mess the whole thing up.

17:33.695 --> 17:36.664
Less of a tactic and more
of a series of incredible events.

17:36.698 --> 17:38.132
And what was the most
incredible event...

17:38.133 --> 17:40.668
when I shot you in front of
all your friends?

17:40.669 --> 17:42.603
I have other friends.
Who?

17:42.638 --> 17:43.938
I knew it was
a dumb idea to invite

17:43.939 --> 17:46.007
the NYPD to a federal drill.

17:46.008 --> 17:47.441
Seriously, man?

17:47.442 --> 17:50.044
You took all our guns, taped us
to a bunch of chairs,

17:50.045 --> 17:53.781
called us fat, and we still took
almost all of you out.

17:53.782 --> 17:55.283
Next year, we're winning
this thing.

17:55.284 --> 17:57.318
Oh, you're not coming next year.

17:57.319 --> 18:00.221
But maybe I'll see you
at the Pentagon Christmas party.

18:00.222 --> 18:01.455
Oh, right.

18:01.490 --> 18:03.291
You guys aren't invited
to those.

18:03.292 --> 18:07.762
Kid Rock was there.
Those are my last words, bro.

18:07.763 --> 18:11.999
Man.
He is just a really bad dude.

18:12.000 --> 18:13.968
Jake, I'm sorry you didn't
get your win.

18:13.969 --> 18:14.968
Are you kidding?

18:14.970 --> 18:16.170
This was a total win.

18:16.205 --> 18:18.673
I haven't checked
my phone in forever.

18:18.674 --> 18:19.674
Now that I've said that,

18:19.675 --> 18:20.675
I do kinda want to
check it, though.

18:20.676 --> 18:22.610
I'm gonna just do it.

18:22.611 --> 18:23.744
No text.

18:23.745 --> 18:26.581
But I'm probably 20 percent
less devastated

18:26.582 --> 18:27.682
than I would have been
this morning.

18:27.683 --> 18:28.983
And that's thanks to you guys.

18:28.984 --> 18:30.751
[gasps] I catharted.

18:30.786 --> 18:32.553
You catharted hard.

18:35.224 --> 18:36.991
Gina, I've been thinking
long and hard

18:36.992 --> 18:38.292
about what happened yesterday.

18:38.293 --> 18:39.727
Oh, pray tell.

18:39.728 --> 18:42.663
But remember, I'm not at your level
so do speak down to me.

18:42.698 --> 18:44.065
I owe you an apology.

18:44.066 --> 18:47.401
The test was wrong to classify
us both as I9 C3 G6's.

18:47.436 --> 18:49.837
That's a terrible apology
from content to tone.

18:49.872 --> 18:53.641
I meant I don't deserve
to be an I9 C3 G6.

18:53.642 --> 18:57.745
I should be an I9 C3 G4
or an I8 C5 G3,

18:57.746 --> 19:02.283
or even an I7 C7 G8 or I2 C1 G3.

19:02.317 --> 19:04.118
Is this a Rain Man impression?

19:04.119 --> 19:05.620
No.

19:05.621 --> 19:08.322
Those are all personality types
not well-suited to leadership.

19:08.323 --> 19:09.657
Just as I have not been.

19:09.658 --> 19:11.993
A good leader should never
diminish those around him.

19:11.994 --> 19:14.095
It was devastating.
Gina.

19:14.129 --> 19:16.364
You're tenacious, you're strong.

19:16.365 --> 19:17.465
You're a great leader.

19:17.466 --> 19:19.800
And most importantly,
any basic bitch

19:19.801 --> 19:21.602
would be lucky to be like you.

19:21.603 --> 19:23.738
Apology accepted.

19:23.739 --> 19:25.606
Can I have a huge raise?
No.

19:25.607 --> 19:27.108
But I am expanding
your responsibilities

19:27.109 --> 19:28.409
to match your great promise.

19:28.410 --> 19:30.278
You are now in charge
of all scheduling decisions

19:30.279 --> 19:31.278
and budget tracking.

19:31.280 --> 19:33.381
No!
You can do it, trust me.

19:33.382 --> 19:37.552
From one I9 C3 G6 to another.

19:40.122 --> 19:42.924
It's crazy how much
he flirts with me.

19:42.958 --> 19:46.561
Hey, so I told Captain Holt
I'd work on Saturday.

19:46.562 --> 19:49.163
Wait, why?
You one fair and square.

19:49.164 --> 19:50.665
I mean, I murdered you.

19:50.666 --> 19:52.433
That was pretty shady.

19:52.434 --> 19:55.837
Also, it was crazy assertive
and I feel like

19:55.838 --> 19:57.566
maybe I don't actually need
power pose training.

19:57.573 --> 19:58.706
You don't.

19:58.707 --> 20:01.976
Mostly because nobody
needs power pose training.

20:01.977 --> 20:03.711
The dinner with my parents
on Saturday

20:03.712 --> 20:06.047
is to introduce them to Marcus.

20:06.081 --> 20:07.715
What?

20:07.749 --> 20:09.050
Why didn't you just tell me?

20:09.051 --> 20:10.651
I didn't know stuff
was getting that serious.

20:10.686 --> 20:13.921
Yeah. It's very embarrassing
having feelings.

20:13.922 --> 20:18.159
Anyway, thank you.
You're welcome.

20:18.160 --> 20:22.430
Rosa's in love!

20:22.464 --> 20:24.165
[whispering] Power pose.

20:24.199 --> 20:27.168
<i>Dropping this off
for Sophia Perez.</i>

20:27.169 --> 20:28.536
Oh, no, you don't have
to call her.

20:28.537 --> 20:30.338
I'll just leave it
here with you.

20:30.339 --> 20:33.808
Okay.
Jake?

20:33.842 --> 20:35.910
Hey.
Hi, uh.

20:35.911 --> 20:38.079
Sorry I didn't text you back.

20:38.080 --> 20:39.814
Thanks for bringing my things.

20:39.815 --> 20:41.949
Well, I need to move on

20:41.950 --> 20:45.720
and having this stuff
around makes that difficult, so.

20:45.721 --> 20:47.321
Including this
multi-surface cleaner?

20:47.356 --> 20:49.524
Well, I only bought
that to impress you.

20:49.525 --> 20:52.126
And it worked, so...

20:52.127 --> 20:54.162
All right, well,
I should probably...

20:54.163 --> 20:55.897
get back to arresting bad guys.

20:55.898 --> 21:00.234
Yeah, I should, uh, get back
to proving they're not so bad.

21:00.235 --> 21:03.004
Jake and Sophia.
Enemies for life.

21:03.038 --> 21:05.039
Like McClane and Gruber.

21:05.040 --> 21:06.140
Both: You're the Gruber.

21:06.141 --> 21:07.942
You're the Gruber.

21:07.943 --> 21:09.043
I'll see you in court, Jake.

21:09.044 --> 21:14.015
Okay. Bye.

21:14.016 --> 21:17.552
Tell me if she turns back
for one last look.

21:17.553 --> 21:18.920
She turning?

21:18.921 --> 21:21.155
Did she turn?
Did she turn?
