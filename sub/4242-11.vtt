WEBVTT

00:00.375 --> 00:02.590
Admit it, Wonder twins,
the only reason why the New Direction

00:02.710 --> 00:04.547
beat the Trouble Tones at Sectionals

00:04.667 --> 00:06.480
is because that pervy clown judge

00:06.600 --> 00:07.816
was freaking high as a kite.

00:07.936 --> 00:10.831
And we did Michael Jackson.
You guys didn't.

00:10.951 --> 00:13.404
That was weeks ago.
Why are you still obssessing?

00:13.524 --> 00:16.725
- One word, Kurt. Michael.
- Guys, fear not.

00:16.845 --> 00:19.727
The world tour of the Cirque du Soleil
tribute show, Immortal, to Michael Jackson

00:19.847 --> 00:21.986
is coming to Columbus in June.
We should all go.

00:22.106 --> 00:25.339
You don't get it. I don't want to see
the spectacle that is Michael.

00:25.459 --> 00:27.438
I want to be the spectacle.

00:27.558 --> 00:30.649
- Everything okay? - Look, we love being
back in New Direction, but...

00:30.769 --> 00:34.019
- We hate that we missed our chance
this year to do Michael. - Yeah, I get it.

00:34.139 --> 00:35.824
And I've been thinking a lot about
Regionals and...

00:35.944 --> 00:37.446
maybe we can do Michael again.

00:37.566 --> 00:40.247
I for one know exactly what song
we should start Michael with.

03:11.353 --> 03:14.571
Okay, it's been exactly 3 days to
the minute since I proposed to you

03:14.691 --> 03:16.241
which is the amount of
time you said you needed

03:16.361 --> 03:17.258
before you'd give me an answer.

03:17.498 --> 03:18.464
Look, this isn't the kind of decision

03:18.532 --> 03:19.582
you can make on a deadline.

03:19.666 --> 03:21.250
Look, I understand,
you said you needed

03:21.335 --> 03:22.868
some time, but...
not hearing a decision's

03:22.920 --> 03:24.086
kind of bumming me out.

03:24.171 --> 03:25.555
No. Look...

03:25.639 --> 03:27.039
I love you, okay?

03:27.090 --> 03:29.842
And... I want to
marry you <i>someday,</i>

03:29.893 --> 03:32.211
and... I, really,
I'm open to anything.

03:32.262 --> 03:34.213
This is all just happening so fast,

03:34.264 --> 03:35.898
and I don't understand it.

03:35.983 --> 03:38.351
I mean, I... I need you
to help me understand.

03:38.402 --> 03:39.552
Okay, well,

03:39.603 --> 03:41.103
even if you don't get into NYADA,

03:41.188 --> 03:42.655
you're still gonna go to New York.

03:42.722 --> 03:44.723
Yes, and I want you to come with me.
And I will,

03:44.775 --> 03:47.160
but... we're crazy if we think
that it's gonna be easier

03:47.227 --> 03:49.028
to be a couple there than it is here.

03:49.079 --> 03:50.563
My point is that

03:50.614 --> 03:52.582
those rings are-are...

03:52.666 --> 03:54.500
will always be a reminder

03:54.568 --> 03:56.452
of exactly how we feel right now.

03:56.537 --> 03:58.671
They're gonna let us take a piece of
our little world into the big city.

03:58.738 --> 04:00.623
Look, that's really romantic,

04:00.707 --> 04:03.793
but I have to be honest-- this all
just sounds really crazy to me, okay?

04:03.877 --> 04:07.597
I don't need to marry you to keep from
straying-- you're the only guy for me.

04:09.349 --> 04:12.802
Okay, I guess...
my answer for now is...

04:12.886 --> 04:14.804
No, no, don't...
don't say anything.

04:14.888 --> 04:17.106
You're right, we shouldn't make this
kind of a decision on a deadline.

04:17.190 --> 04:18.774
Just, uh...

04:18.858 --> 04:20.091
take a couple more days, okay?

04:26.817 --> 04:29.452
(piano playing "I Just Can't
Stop Loving You")

04:29.536 --> 04:30.953
(bell rings)

04:31.038 --> 04:33.206
Okay, favorite
Michael Jackson memory. Go.

04:33.273 --> 04:36.125
When I was one, my mom showed me the
VHS tape of his Motown special,

04:36.210 --> 04:38.160
and when he did the
moonwalk across the stage

04:38.245 --> 04:41.297
for the first time in history,
I uttered my first words:

04:41.381 --> 04:44.217
"Hot damn." I owe the King of
Pop a deep debt of gratitude.

04:44.284 --> 04:46.785
He was the first one to pull off
the sequined military jacket,

04:46.837 --> 04:49.088
long before one Kurt Hummel
made it iconic.

04:49.139 --> 04:51.724
I have to be honest--
I never really got him.

04:51.791 --> 04:53.309
And we are no longer
on speaking terms.

04:53.393 --> 04:54.960
No, I think he's
an amazing performer, but I've

04:55.012 --> 04:56.629
never really
just got what he was about.

04:56.680 --> 04:58.631
Rachel, he was best friends with
Liza Minnelli and Liz Taylor.

04:58.682 --> 05:01.234
No, all I'm saying is that
I-I just... I haven't connected

05:01.301 --> 05:02.568
with him the way that
I have with the likes of Barbra

05:02.636 --> 05:03.569
or either of the Stephens.

05:03.637 --> 05:05.571
Sondheim. Schwartz.

05:05.639 --> 05:06.906
I'd throw this mocha in your face,

05:06.973 --> 05:08.474
but it's not nearly scalding enough.

05:08.525 --> 05:11.143
Okay, but just, since you guys
are so jazzed about him,

05:11.194 --> 05:12.411
I think it's a good idea.

05:12.479 --> 05:15.248
Well, that might not be the best idea.

05:15.315 --> 05:17.333
Hey, Blaine.
Hello, everyone else.

05:17.417 --> 05:19.502
Does he live here or something?
Seriously, you are always here.

05:19.586 --> 05:20.920
Why don't you think
that's a good idea?

05:20.987 --> 05:22.538
Because we're doing MJ for Regionals.

05:22.623 --> 05:23.822
You see, Warblers drew first position,

05:23.874 --> 05:25.625
so as soon as I heard what

05:25.676 --> 05:27.660
your plan was, I changed
our set list accordingly.

05:27.711 --> 05:29.345
I'm sorry, how...
how did you hear?

05:29.429 --> 05:30.996
Uh, Blaine told me this morning.

05:31.048 --> 05:33.432
I just called for a tip on how to get

05:33.500 --> 05:35.051
red wine out
of my blazer piping, and he

05:35.135 --> 05:37.169
would not stop going on about it.

05:37.220 --> 05:38.721
I may have mentioned it.

05:38.805 --> 05:40.389
How often do you talk?
Oh, my God, hey, Kurt.

05:40.474 --> 05:41.557
I didn't recognize you.

05:41.642 --> 05:42.858
You are wearing boy clothes for once.

05:42.943 --> 05:44.009
All right, twink,

05:44.061 --> 05:45.861
I think it's time that I show you

05:45.946 --> 05:47.229
a little Lima Heights hospitality.

05:47.314 --> 05:49.515
Unless you want to join
your relatives in prison,

05:49.566 --> 05:51.367
that's probably not the best idea.

05:51.451 --> 05:54.370
You see, my dad is sort of what
you'd call a state's attorney.

05:54.454 --> 05:56.405
But if you had a piñata
you wanted delivered,

05:56.490 --> 05:58.741
I bet he could make
sure that got to them.

05:58.825 --> 06:00.359
All right, so here's
what you guys should know.

06:00.410 --> 06:02.027
I am captain of the Warblers now,

06:02.079 --> 06:03.479
and I'm tired of playing nice.

06:05.916 --> 06:07.383
There has to be some kind

06:07.467 --> 06:09.502
of show choir competition
committee we can complain to.

06:09.553 --> 06:12.088
I know it sucks, guys, but
it's not the end of the world.

06:12.172 --> 06:14.473
Heck, you had your set list
stolen the day of the competition

06:14.541 --> 06:17.143
at Sectionals, and you
pulled that one off, right?

06:17.210 --> 06:19.145
Well, they can have our
<i>Journey</i> and our <i>Dreamgirls,</i>

06:19.212 --> 06:22.214
but pilfering my Michael, mm-mm,
that's another level, not okay.

06:22.265 --> 06:25.318
I'm not exactly comfortable having this
conversation with Blaine in the room.

06:25.385 --> 06:27.386
Clearly, once a Warbler,
always a Warbler.

06:27.437 --> 06:29.989
Uh, wh-what? Dude, you told
them what we were gonna do.

06:30.056 --> 06:31.774
You're like a modern-day
Eggs Benedict. He's on notice

06:31.858 --> 06:33.025
as far as I'm concerned.

06:33.076 --> 06:35.328
FINN: We should all
be on notice. I mean,

06:35.395 --> 06:36.445
next to Vocal Adrenaline, the Warblers

06:36.530 --> 06:37.997
are the best Glee Club in the state,

06:38.064 --> 06:40.282
and for a lot of us, this is
our last shot at a championship,

06:40.367 --> 06:41.867
so we should stop complaining

06:41.918 --> 06:44.203
about the Warblers
and figure out how to beat them.

06:44.254 --> 06:45.504
I couldn't have said it
better myself, Finn.

06:45.572 --> 06:47.289
I'm less worried about
our set list right now

06:47.374 --> 06:49.425
and more interested in getting
us in the right mindset

06:49.509 --> 06:50.843
to crush those guys.

06:50.910 --> 06:53.262
Which is why our
lesson for the week is...

06:57.351 --> 06:59.719
What Would Michael Jackson Do?

06:59.770 --> 07:01.137
He'd fight back.

07:01.221 --> 07:03.356
He'd say Regionals is ours,
MJ is ours,

07:03.423 --> 07:05.775
and if they want it, they can pry it

07:05.859 --> 07:08.093
from o sequin-gloved hand.
Mm-hmm. Straight up.

07:08.145 --> 07:10.780
In 1983, MTV said they wouldn't
air his "Billie Jean" video.

07:10.864 --> 07:12.398
What'd he do?
He fought back.

07:12.449 --> 07:14.316
They aired it, and the <i>Thriller</i> album

07:14.401 --> 07:16.152
sold an additional ten million copies.

07:16.236 --> 07:18.604
That's right.
I know what Michael would do.

07:18.655 --> 07:21.407
I think he would take it
to the streets.

07:21.475 --> 07:23.459
(intro to "Billie Jean" plays)

07:27.180 --> 07:30.049
Well... we're here.

07:30.116 --> 07:31.300
We got something to settle.

07:31.385 --> 07:33.252
Both of us want to use MJ,

07:33.303 --> 07:34.754
but only one can.
We're having

07:34.805 --> 07:35.988
a Jackson-off,
Nick at Nite.

07:36.056 --> 07:37.339
Winner gets
the King of Pop for Regionals.

07:37.424 --> 07:39.642
What, us against...
the two of you?

07:39.726 --> 07:40.893
You really think you're that bad?

07:40.960 --> 07:42.061
Is that what they teach you

07:42.128 --> 07:43.396
at that little public school of yours?

07:43.463 --> 07:44.897
It's time to see who's bad.

07:44.964 --> 07:45.631
(snaps fingers)

10:13.283 --> 10:14.724
How is he?
Is he okay?

10:14.844 --> 10:17.010
Uh, it's his right eye.

10:17.367 --> 10:20.869
Uh, the doctor says that
his cornea is deeply scratched

10:20.937 --> 10:23.239
and he has to have surgery.

10:23.290 --> 10:25.152
In all my years as
a teacher and a student,

10:25.272 --> 10:26.942
I have never known a slushee

10:26.993 --> 10:28.577
to do <i>that</i> kind of damage.

10:28.628 --> 10:30.746
That's 'cause it wasn't
a normal slushee, Mr. Shue.

10:30.797 --> 10:33.249
There was... stuff in it,
rocks or something.

10:33.300 --> 10:35.117
He <i>wanted</i> to do that damage.

10:35.168 --> 10:37.670
Well, unless you have proof that
he tampered with the slushee

10:37.754 --> 10:39.454
the police aren't interested
in getting involved.

10:39.506 --> 10:40.889
Sebastian is evil.

10:40.957 --> 10:42.925
He needs to be expelled.

10:42.976 --> 10:45.227
Look, Figgins and I spoke
to Dalton's headmaster.

10:45.295 --> 10:46.729
They're opening up an investigation.

10:46.796 --> 10:48.147
So, guys, I'm telling you,

10:48.231 --> 10:50.132
please let the system handle this one.

10:50.183 --> 10:53.736
No. Dalton's old-school, Mr.
Shue-- they're not gonna turn their backs

10:53.803 --> 10:55.637
on one of their own-- we need payback.
An eye for an eye.

10:55.689 --> 10:57.973
No. I have a zero-tolerance
policy for violence,

10:58.024 --> 10:59.141
of any kind.

10:59.192 --> 11:00.843
That's not how we do things.

11:00.910 --> 11:02.811
No, we sing, and
that's all we ever do.

11:02.862 --> 11:04.479
Do you want to get
disqualified from Regionals?

11:04.531 --> 11:06.665
I don't give a damn about Regionals.

11:06.750 --> 11:08.317
What do you expect
from us? We're people.

11:08.368 --> 11:09.918
I know the rest of the world

11:09.986 --> 11:11.954
may not see us like that,
but when they tease us

11:12.005 --> 11:13.005
and throw stuff at us

11:13.089 --> 11:14.290
and toss us in Dumpsters

11:14.341 --> 11:15.591
and tell us that we're
nothing but losers

11:15.658 --> 11:17.543
with stupid dreams, it freaking hurts.

11:17.627 --> 11:19.511
And we're supposed to
turn the other cheek

11:19.596 --> 11:21.163
and be the bigger man
by telling ourselves

11:21.214 --> 11:22.998
that those dreams and how hard we work

11:23.049 --> 11:24.266
make us better than them,

11:24.334 --> 11:25.567
but it gets pretty damn hard to feel

11:25.635 --> 11:27.002
that way when they always get to win.

11:27.053 --> 11:28.771
I get how upsetting this is for you.

11:28.838 --> 11:30.189
No, you don't,

11:30.273 --> 11:32.007
and don't give me any of
that "it gets better" crap

11:32.058 --> 11:33.525
because I'm not interested
in it getting any better.

11:33.610 --> 11:35.527
I want it to be better,
like, right now.

11:35.612 --> 11:38.147
I want to hurt them
the way they hurt us.

11:38.198 --> 11:39.615
No, worse.

11:39.682 --> 11:41.116
I want them to feel my pain

11:41.184 --> 11:44.186
because frankly that's
all I have left to give.

11:44.237 --> 11:46.855
Artie, take a break.

Hey.

14:30.320 --> 14:31.737
Look, I need your advice,

14:31.821 --> 14:35.290
all right, about,
about an adult problem.

14:35.358 --> 14:36.658
Holy crap, are you pregnant? No.

Look, I'm, I'm coming
to you as a friend

14:38.745 --> 14:39.995
and, oddly, because I also think

14:40.046 --> 14:41.380
that you're the only
person that'll give me

14:41.464 --> 14:43.298
just a, a straightforward

14:43.366 --> 14:44.666
and a thoughtful answer about this.

14:44.717 --> 14:45.884
You're right, I'm sorry.

14:45.969 --> 14:48.136
Yes, I can keep a secret.

14:48.204 --> 14:52.307
Okay... well, um...

14:52.375 --> 14:55.761
Finn asked me to marry him.

14:55.845 --> 14:57.879
(gasps)

14:57.931 --> 14:59.314
What did you say?

14:59.382 --> 15:01.650
I said I-I needed
to think about it.

15:02.769 --> 15:04.820
Well, you can't.

15:04.887 --> 15:05.904
Why?

15:05.989 --> 15:07.322
I mean, plenty of people

15:07.390 --> 15:09.241
get married at our age,
and, I mean, I know that

15:09.325 --> 15:10.776
he and I haven't lived together
or anything,

15:10.860 --> 15:15.080
but, you know, I love him
and he's the one, I know it.

15:17.083 --> 15:19.901
What's this?

15:19.953 --> 15:21.503
My ticket out of here.

15:21.571 --> 15:23.422
I got into Yale, early admissions.

15:23.506 --> 15:26.542
Turns out my essay
about overcoming adversity

15:26.593 --> 15:28.877
while maintaining
a straight-A average

15:28.928 --> 15:30.245
during a teen pregnancy
really turned on

15:30.296 --> 15:31.763
the admissions boards.

15:31.848 --> 15:33.966
Quinn, that's amazing.

15:34.050 --> 15:36.418
That's so great.

15:36.469 --> 15:37.936
That's great.

15:38.021 --> 15:39.688
I'm sure you'll get
your NYADA one soon.

15:39.755 --> 15:41.139
Oh, yeah, I mean, New York mail

15:41.224 --> 15:43.725
is notoriously slow, so it's...

15:43.776 --> 15:45.894
My point being is that

15:45.945 --> 15:49.281
I've dated Finn, Puck, Sam.

15:49.365 --> 15:50.732
Even thought I loved some of them,

15:50.783 --> 15:52.484
but by the time

15:52.569 --> 15:56.771
the snow falls in New Haven
next winter, I won't know why.

15:56.823 --> 16:00.459
So are, are you saying that
Finn and I should break up?

16:00.543 --> 16:03.378
I'm all for making the most
of the next few months,

16:03.446 --> 16:04.580
but I'd hate the idea

16:04.631 --> 16:06.615
o-of dragging
an anchor from my past

16:06.683 --> 16:08.584
into the bright lights of my future.

16:08.635 --> 16:12.504
Rachel, you have
an amazing life ahead of you.

16:12.589 --> 16:14.089
As hard as it may be,

16:14.140 --> 16:16.892
if you want everything
that you've ever dreamed of,

16:16.959 --> 16:19.461
you're going to have
to break up with him.

16:19.512 --> 16:21.179
That's an awful thing to say. Look,

16:21.264 --> 16:23.015
you wanted straight and thoughtful.

16:23.099 --> 16:24.516
I guess at one point

16:24.601 --> 16:26.268
it made sense to love somebody
for your whole life,

16:26.319 --> 16:27.486
but it doesn't anymore.

16:31.691 --> 16:33.742
what we're going to want in 15 years.

16:33.809 --> 16:35.494
I mean, Finn and I--
we can grow together.

16:35.578 --> 16:40.315
Look, Rachel... you and Finn
are a lovely couple.

16:42.368 --> 16:44.419
But if you really want to be happy,

16:44.487 --> 16:47.122
you're going to have
to say good-bye.

We are so proud

19:29.001 --> 19:30.035
of you, Quinn.

19:30.119 --> 19:33.154
I want to thank you guys...

19:33.206 --> 19:35.340
because without each
and every one of you,

19:35.424 --> 19:36.875
this would have never happened.

that's why I'm standing here.

but the truth is, is that

19:51.006 --> 19:53.141
without all of those,

19:53.192 --> 19:55.477
I never would have dreamed this
to be my future.

19:57.029 --> 20:00.181
I was the only one standing
in the way of myself.

20:02.068 --> 20:05.120
You can't change your past...

20:05.187 --> 20:09.624
but you can let go
and start your future.

20:09.692 --> 20:11.626
Yale, yeah.

20:11.694 --> 20:13.528
(excited chatter)

20:15.131 --> 20:17.632
Yale!
Oh, my God!

20:22.479 --> 20:23.312
(school bell ringing)

20:29.468 --> 20:31.970
Hey, what are you doing?

20:32.021 --> 20:33.138
Trying to keep the flames

20:33.189 --> 20:34.939
from shooting
out of the side of my face.

20:35.007 --> 20:36.638
Well, that outfit isn't helping.

20:37.143 --> 20:39.227
I agree with Artie.

20:39.581 --> 20:41.382
I'm tired of being
stepped on all the time.

20:41.450 --> 20:44.002
I take a lot of crap from
a lot of people, but I refuse

20:44.086 --> 20:46.587
to take it from Sebastian
the Criminal Chipmunk,

20:46.639 --> 20:48.756
so I've been sitting here
for the last hour,

20:48.807 --> 20:50.675
making a list of ways
to get back at him.

20:50.759 --> 20:53.177
Well, today is your lucky
day, because Auntie Snixx

20:53.262 --> 20:55.129
just arrived on the Bitchtown Express.

20:55.180 --> 20:57.181
Now, my suggestion is that we drag him

20:57.266 --> 20:58.650
bound and gagged to a tattoo parlor

20:58.734 --> 21:01.853
for a tramp stamp that
reads "Tips Appreciated" or

21:01.937 --> 21:04.022
"Congratulations, You're
My 1,000th Customer!"

21:04.106 --> 21:07.542
After what he did to Blaine,
I really wanted

21:07.609 --> 21:10.028
to hurt him.

21:10.112 --> 21:11.446
But I can't.

21:11.497 --> 21:13.364
I've fought against violence
at this school for too long.

21:13.449 --> 21:16.150
I, I have to take the high road.

21:16.201 --> 21:17.168
You know what, Prancy Smurf?

21:17.252 --> 21:18.652
I respect that.

21:18.704 --> 21:20.538
You're probably right.
I want to go to a college

21:20.622 --> 21:22.656
that isn't a FEMA trailer
in a prison yard,

21:22.708 --> 21:24.342
so let's take the high road.

21:24.426 --> 21:26.928
We're not going to beat
Sebastian by playing dirty...

21:26.995 --> 21:29.347
but we are going to beat him.

21:29.431 --> 21:31.883
(school bell ringing)

21:36.805 --> 21:38.940
You know why I like this
week's assignment so much?

21:39.007 --> 21:41.559
Hands down, without a doubt,
one of my favorite singers

21:41.643 --> 21:42.643
of all time is Michael Jackson.

21:42.695 --> 21:43.811
Listen, if I have to hawk

21:43.862 --> 21:45.346
my weave on eBay, I'm going to see

21:45.397 --> 21:46.514
the <i>Immortal</i> tour
when it comes to Ohio.

21:46.565 --> 21:48.349
Speaking of immortal...

21:50.569 --> 21:52.120
Since we're gonna be seeing
your name up in lights

21:52.187 --> 21:53.705
for the rest of our lives, I thought

21:53.789 --> 21:55.039
we might as well start today.

21:55.124 --> 21:56.624
Sam Evans,

21:56.691 --> 21:58.292
you are crazy.

21:58.360 --> 22:00.194
Crazy about you.

22:00.245 --> 22:03.864
You know, we've never
sang a duet together.

22:03.916 --> 22:05.500
I thought we could do
"Human Nature."

22:06.668 --> 22:07.552
Would you sing with me?

22:07.636 --> 22:09.721
After that you can

22:09.805 --> 22:11.055
go back to Shane;
I won't stop you.

22:11.140 --> 22:14.008
Sam, I can't.

22:14.059 --> 22:14.892
Let's...

22:14.977 --> 22:16.144
Let's talk later.

24:49.298 --> 24:50.164
(whispering)

24:52.167 --> 24:53.751
Kurt?

24:53.835 --> 24:55.720
Your dad wants to talk to you.

24:55.804 --> 24:57.004
What's wrong?
Is Blaine okay?

24:57.055 --> 24:58.038
He's fine.

24:58.090 --> 25:01.208
The mail came.

25:01.260 --> 25:02.710
NYADA.

25:02.778 --> 25:05.212
(school bell ringing)
Dude, come on.

25:05.264 --> 25:07.064
This is like the fifth
room we've been to.

25:07.149 --> 25:09.200
What's wrong with the
library or the lunchroom?

25:09.268 --> 25:10.401
None of those felt right.

25:10.485 --> 25:12.219
This is it, Dad.

25:12.271 --> 25:14.438
This is one of those
crossroad moments in life.

25:14.523 --> 25:16.107
I mean, whatever's in this
envelope is going to determine

25:16.191 --> 25:17.825
whether I go right or left.

25:17.892 --> 25:20.060
I'm here, no matter what it says.

25:20.112 --> 25:21.946
Okay?

25:29.087 --> 25:30.705
(whispering)
"Dear Mr. Hummel..."

25:33.008 --> 25:34.842
(sighs)

25:36.762 --> 25:38.679
What? What?

25:38.747 --> 25:40.932
I'm a finalist.

25:41.016 --> 25:42.883
(laughs)

25:44.919 --> 25:46.804
Oh, Dad, Dad, your heart.

25:46.888 --> 25:48.589
Oh, screw my heart!
You did it!

25:48.640 --> 25:50.107
You did it, Kurt!

25:50.192 --> 25:51.475
Oh, man, oh!

25:51.560 --> 25:53.861
Who's gonna tell Blaine?
You got to let me do it.

25:53.928 --> 25:54.895
Dad, are you crying?

25:54.947 --> 25:56.113
You beat them all.

25:56.198 --> 25:58.449
They threw everything at you.

25:58.533 --> 26:00.234
They tried to beat you down.

26:00.285 --> 26:02.286
But you know what?
You're unstoppable, Kurt.

26:02.371 --> 26:04.372
I am so proud to be your dad.

26:04.439 --> 26:07.959
They can never
take this away from you.

26:08.043 --> 26:11.212
Right now, in this moment,

26:11.279 --> 26:14.298
on this day, you won.

26:14.383 --> 26:16.250
(laughs)

26:17.669 --> 26:19.503
Oh, way to go, dude.

26:19.588 --> 26:20.888
(school bell rings)

26:24.343 --> 26:25.776
KURT:
Rachel! Rachel!

26:25.844 --> 26:27.311
I got it; I got my NYADA letter.

26:27.396 --> 26:28.813
I got in the finals.
You did?

26:28.897 --> 26:31.232
I'm a finalist.
You did? That's so great.

26:31.299 --> 26:33.584
Wh-What did yours say?

26:33.652 --> 26:35.486
I didn't get one.

26:37.556 --> 26:38.856
Oh, that doesn't mean anything.

26:38.924 --> 26:41.459
That just means they
haven't sent it yet.

26:41.526 --> 26:43.294
I didn't even make it to the finals.

26:45.330 --> 26:47.531
(voice breaking):
I knew it, I...

26:47.599 --> 26:52.069
(sighs) I had this weird feeling
in my stomach all week long.

26:52.137 --> 26:54.455
Rachel, don't be stupid.

26:54.506 --> 26:55.322
"Stupid"?

26:57.376 --> 26:59.326
Stupid is watching all of your friends

26:59.378 --> 27:01.045
make plans for their future

27:01.129 --> 27:03.997
and realizing that
you have none at all.

27:04.049 --> 27:06.150
No plans, no college,

27:06.218 --> 27:08.436
nowhere to go.

27:08.503 --> 27:11.972
All I have here is
my boyfriend, and...

27:13.174 --> 27:15.342
And I have no idea what I'm doing.

27:16.812 --> 27:18.446
(sighs)

27:18.513 --> 27:19.730
Come here.

27:19.815 --> 27:21.532
(sobs)

27:21.616 --> 27:24.452
It's all right.

27:24.519 --> 27:26.287
(school bell ringing)

27:28.138 --> 27:30.708
"Miss Jolier,
a dramatic directorial debut,"

27:30.828 --> 27:33.729
"she expects her second feature to
have far more honey than blood."

27:34.358 --> 27:35.858
BLAINE:
Hey.

27:35.943 --> 27:36.880
Hey, guys.

27:37.000 --> 27:38.530
We brought you, um,
chicken noodle soup.

27:38.605 --> 27:41.089
I know it's not used to
typically help eye injuries,

27:41.140 --> 27:42.224
but we figured it

27:42.275 --> 27:43.725
couldn't hurt.
And I brought you

27:43.776 --> 27:46.812
a couple of eye-patch-featuring
flicks from my collection.

27:46.896 --> 27:50.449
I got, uh, <i>Pirates of the</i>
<i>Caribbean: On Stranger Tides,</i>

27:50.533 --> 27:52.934
<i>Valkyrie,</i> and <i>Sky Captain</i>
<i>and the World of Tomorrow.</i>

27:52.986 --> 27:54.036
Aw, thank you guys.

27:54.103 --> 27:56.104
It's so amazing;
It really means

27:56.155 --> 27:58.206
a lot to me that you'd come
by to check up on me.

27:58.274 --> 27:59.241
However,

27:59.292 --> 28:00.959
I cannot let a single moment pass

28:01.044 --> 28:03.495
without first...

28:03.580 --> 28:06.131
raising a zero-calorie toast

28:06.215 --> 28:07.799
(can pops)
to one Mr. Kurt Hummel, aka...

28:07.884 --> 28:08.667
NYADA finalist.

28:08.751 --> 28:10.586
Yay.

28:12.088 --> 28:13.355
Cheers.

28:14.657 --> 28:16.425
So, Blaine, uh, when's the surgery?

28:16.492 --> 28:18.994
(sighs)
This week.

28:19.062 --> 28:21.229
Honestly, I'm terrified.

28:21.297 --> 28:22.631
Don't sweat it, dude.

28:22.699 --> 28:23.999
You'll heal up good as new.

28:24.067 --> 28:26.568
Yeah, and there are tons
of legendary performers

28:26.636 --> 28:29.504
who've only had one eye:
Sammy Davis, Jr., Columbo.

28:29.572 --> 28:32.174
And Stevie Wonder, he did
pretty good with no eyes at all.

28:32.241 --> 28:34.643
You guys, I'm really upset
that I'm missing Michael Week.

28:34.711 --> 28:37.012
It just totally sucks.

28:37.080 --> 28:37.879
Well, that's why

28:37.947 --> 28:39.181
we figured we'd bring

28:39.248 --> 28:40.983
a little bit of Michael to you.
Yup.

28:41.050 --> 28:42.184
Okay.

Hey, Andrew McCarthy.

30:50.246 --> 30:52.848
Don't know if you heard,
but Blaine may lose an eye.

30:52.915 --> 30:55.050
The same Blaine who was just
besties with most of you

30:55.118 --> 30:56.918
not four months ago.

30:56.986 --> 30:58.253
Wait, are you serious?

30:58.321 --> 30:59.421
Is he gonna be okay?

30:59.489 --> 31:00.989
Well, sure, if he doesn't care

31:01.057 --> 31:01.857
about seeing in three dimensions.

31:01.924 --> 31:03.125
Trent, I got this.

31:03.192 --> 31:05.127
Bummer about Blaine, he was pretty.

31:05.194 --> 31:06.128
He shouldn't have gotten
in the way, though.

31:06.195 --> 31:07.829
That slushee was meant for Kurt.

31:07.897 --> 31:10.899
You may look like the
villain out of a cheesy '80s

31:10.967 --> 31:12.167
high school movie,

31:12.235 --> 31:14.102
but you should know that
I am fully prepared

31:14.170 --> 31:15.904
to go all Danny LaRusso on your ass.

31:15.972 --> 31:17.706
Admit you put something
in that slushee.

31:17.774 --> 31:19.407
What was it, huh?

31:19.475 --> 31:20.709
Glass? Asphalt?

31:20.777 --> 31:22.010
Red dye number six.

31:22.078 --> 31:23.812
You're a liar.

31:23.880 --> 31:25.447
She questioned my honor.

31:25.515 --> 31:27.883
I demand satisfaction

31:30.853 --> 31:32.921
Cello guys, can you hang
back for a second? I'm gonna

31:32.989 --> 31:33.955
need you for this one.

31:34.023 --> 31:35.023
SEBASTIAN:
Everyone else clear out.

31:35.091 --> 31:36.258
I don't want you to see me

31:36.325 --> 31:37.259

33:44.754 --> 33:45.954
Now tell me the truth.

33:46.022 --> 33:47.522
What did you put in that slushee?

33:47.590 --> 33:49.090
Rock salt... but it's okay.

33:49.158 --> 33:50.358
Why is it okay?

33:50.426 --> 33:52.727
I just told you
that Blaine had to have surgery.

33:52.795 --> 33:55.964
It's okay because I didn't
put anything in this one.

33:58.718 --> 34:00.269
(school bell rings) Before Mr.
Shue gets here, come on.

34:00.336 --> 34:02.638
(laughter)

34:04.119 --> 34:05.236
Brittany, lock the door.

34:05.287 --> 34:06.370
I don't know how to do that.

34:06.438 --> 34:07.771
Um, what's going on?

34:07.823 --> 34:10.241
We've got the Warblers
right where we want them.

34:10.292 --> 34:12.543
And because he's the smoothest
criminal I know,

34:12.610 --> 34:14.295
Artie was able to find a spy store

34:14.379 --> 34:16.163
that sells top-secret
surveillance equipment.

34:16.248 --> 34:17.614
Not top-secret.

34:17.666 --> 34:19.283
I just got a tape recorder
from OfficeMax.

34:19.333 --> 34:20.418
Okay, okay, whatever.

34:20.469 --> 34:22.420
In any case, I taped it
to my underboob

34:22.471 --> 34:24.455
when we went to Dalton, and I got

34:24.505 --> 34:26.123
Sebastian on tape admitting
that there was rock-salt

34:26.174 --> 34:27.475
in that slushee that blinded Blaine.

34:27.559 --> 34:30.177
Now, all we have to do is send
this tape to the po-po,

34:30.262 --> 34:31.962
and that little bitchlet
is headed to juvie.

34:32.014 --> 34:33.630
SANTANA:
Admit it. Tell me the truth.

34:33.681 --> 34:35.399
What did you put in that slushee?

34:35.467 --> 34:36.601
SEBASTIAN:
Rock salt.

34:36.652 --> 34:38.402
No. No, we're not doing that.

34:38.469 --> 34:40.353
Why? Kurt, this isn't violent.
This is clever.

34:40.438 --> 34:42.106
I taped it to my underboob.

34:42.157 --> 34:43.690
So he gets kicked out of school.

34:43.775 --> 34:46.444
The Warblers still do Michael,
and they still beat us.

34:46.495 --> 34:49.163
Look, I want to see Sebastian's
head turning on a spit,

34:49.248 --> 34:51.581
but I've realized that you
can't go looking for payback

34:51.650 --> 34:53.000
every time the world wrongs you.

34:53.085 --> 34:54.652
If Michael went after all the haters,

34:54.703 --> 34:56.320
he would have never had any time

34:56.371 --> 34:57.455
to do all that amazing music.

34:57.506 --> 34:59.173
So, we're not gonna
punish the Warblers.

34:59.258 --> 35:01.175
We're gonna teach them a lesson,

35:01.260 --> 35:03.844
and I think I know how.

35:03.929 --> 35:07.014
I've reserved the auditorium,
so if you all just follow me.

35:07.099 --> 35:07.965
SANTANA:
Oh, wait.

35:08.016 --> 35:09.517
If Kurt would have taped this

35:09.601 --> 35:11.185
to his junk, I would have
never heard the end of it.

35:11.270 --> 35:12.386
We would have had
a whole week of songs

35:12.471 --> 35:13.837
about it.

35:13.889 --> 35:15.640
Rachel, can I borrow you for a second?

35:15.691 --> 35:17.558
Yeah.

35:19.194 --> 35:21.395
So, are we gonna
practice or something?

35:21.480 --> 35:23.781
Look, I know that
you're waiting for an answer,

35:23.848 --> 35:25.650
and-and trust me,
you deserve it...

35:25.701 --> 35:27.868
No, no, I get it.
It's a big decision.

35:27.953 --> 35:31.238
It's just, the way I asked
you, I kind of left out

35:31.323 --> 35:32.790
the most important part.

35:32.857 --> 35:35.192
About how much rent we would
save if we went twosies?

(song ends, applause)

41:56.173 --> 41:57.506
Very moving.

41:57.557 --> 41:59.175
Come on, Sebastian.
Give it up.

41:59.226 --> 42:00.559
That is the kind of attitude

42:00.644 --> 42:01.894
that lost us Regionals last year.

42:01.978 --> 42:04.096
I could call the cops
or your headmaster

42:04.181 --> 42:06.816
and get you kicked out
of school or even arrested

42:06.883 --> 42:08.851
for assaulting Blaine
with that slushee.

42:08.902 --> 42:11.520
All of this would be
just awfully terrifying

42:11.571 --> 42:14.156
if you had any proof whatsoever.

42:14.224 --> 42:16.909
You mean like you on tape
admitting to it?

42:18.161 --> 42:19.445
(gasps)

42:19.529 --> 42:20.996
But you know what?

42:21.064 --> 42:23.082
It just wouldn't be
as much fun winning Regionals

42:23.166 --> 42:26.235
if you weren't there to suffer
through all the agony of defeat.

42:26.286 --> 42:28.504
SANTANA: At least now, all
your teammates get to know

42:28.571 --> 42:29.789
exactly what kind of guy you are.

42:31.792 --> 42:32.758
ARTIE:
Now get the hell

42:32.843 --> 42:34.009
out of my auditorium.

42:36.096 --> 42:37.763
School's out!

42:37.848 --> 42:39.748
(school bell ringing)

42:39.800 --> 42:41.684
(crowd chatter)

42:50.143 --> 42:53.195
Is... Is-Is that the...?

42:53.263 --> 42:56.399
My NYADA letter finally
came in the mail, and, uh...

42:56.450 --> 42:58.317
and I'm a finalist.

42:59.602 --> 43:01.070
I'm a finalist!

43:01.121 --> 43:02.455
I'm a finalist!
(laughing)

43:02.539 --> 43:03.739
I'm so happy.
Oh, congrats.

43:03.790 --> 43:05.107
Thank you.

43:05.158 --> 43:06.876
Oh, have you told Finn yet?
