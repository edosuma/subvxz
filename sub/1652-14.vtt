  One of my partners got shot,

        it's all right.

       - Why is he back?

04:09.283 --> 04:11.783
        - I don't know,
    but he asked about you.

04:11.785 --> 04:13.885
       - Did you tell him
         about travis?

04:13.887 --> 04:16.255
        - Of course not.

04:16.257 --> 04:20.358
         But he's here,
so how do you want to play this?

04:20.361 --> 04:21.793
         I can tell him
      to leave you alone,

04:21.795 --> 04:25.430
       Or I can give him
       your phone number,

04:25.432 --> 04:28.433
     Or I can pick a place
     for all of us to meet,

04:28.435 --> 04:29.434
      And I can be there.

04:29.436 --> 04:31.536

   for a little clarification

05:23.457 --> 05:25.991
     On what you just said.

05:28.795 --> 05:32.898
  - Pulpo ain't making it back
        to a jail cell.

05:32.900 --> 05:35.000
   That clear enough for you?

05:46.546 --> 05:46.778

         He ditched it,
    and he switched to this.

05:58.792 --> 05:59.758
      - Where's the body?

05:59.760 --> 06:02.027

   let the guy live to talk.

06:12.906 --> 06:15.540

    out of the academy, man.

   - Even if that means being
      part of a lynch mob?

07:38.759 --> 07:39.758

if I'm gonna turn over my shield

07:39.760 --> 07:41.693
          And protest,
          no, I'm not.

            I mean--

     - What I'm saying is,
         what do we do?

07:45.632 --> 07:47.866
 If we find pulpo, are we just
 gonna turn him over to voight?

07:47.868 --> 07:49.868
          - All right,
        everybody relax.

07:49.870 --> 07:55.073
   What we do is find pulpo,
 and then we can figure it out.

07:55.075 --> 07:57.709

     what we needed, yeah.

08:02.249 --> 08:03.882
  - What about lina's family?

08:03.884 --> 08:05.550

   Came up clean, and so did
    her cell phone records,

08:07.488 --> 08:08.820

     it's worth a drive-by.

   He reps half the criminals

     He didn't get that rep
by cooperating with the police,

08:56.236 --> 08:59.671
     I need you to call in
        a death threat.

08:59.673 --> 09:02.140
           All right?
            Come on.

09:02.142 --> 09:03.975
        - You never know
 when it's your time to shine.

09:03.977 --> 09:06.711
              Go.

      <i> es un hombre muerto.</i>

09:08.015 --> 09:09.581

09:09.583 --> 09:11.750
      <i> Timpone esta muerto.</i>

09:11.752 --> 09:13.084
       <i> Estamos llegando.</i>

09:13.086 --> 09:17.255
       <i> Estamos llegando.</i>

09:17.257 --> 09:18.957
    That convincing enough?

09:18.959 --> 09:20.292
         - I bought it.

09:21.561 --> 09:22.794
    - Hey, wait. Easy, easy.

09:22.796 --> 09:24.129
        C.P.D., big guy.

09:24.131 --> 09:25.664
           All right?

09:25.666 --> 09:27.766
         - Wait. Wait!

09:27.768 --> 09:28.800
     You can't go in there.

09:28.802 --> 09:32.737
- Ooh, what's with the hardware,
            timpone?

09:32.739 --> 09:35.073
       - I have a permit.
   - We're looking for pulpo.

09:35.075 --> 09:37.108
      - Yeah, apparently,
      he's looking for me.

09:37.110 --> 09:38.810
  I just got a call from him.

09:38.812 --> 09:40.845
             - Hmm.
   What do you make of that?

09:40.847 --> 09:41.980
      - A call from pulpo?

09:41.982 --> 09:43.315
        That ain't good.

09:43.317 --> 09:44.849
  - But you don't come cheap.

09:44.851 --> 09:47.852
   Pulpo spend his last chunk
       of change on you?

09:47.854 --> 09:49.688
           Got life,
     now he wants a refund?

09:49.690 --> 09:50.889
 - Yeah, that's why I got him.

09:50.891 --> 09:53.892
      - You think that you
      and some rent-a-cop

09:53.894 --> 09:55.226
       Are gonna keep him
      from getting in here

09:55.228 --> 09:56.861
    If he really wanted to?
             Mm-mm.

09:56.863 --> 09:58.863
        - I've arrested
       a lot of scumbags

09:58.865 --> 10:01.166
      You've put back out
         on the street,

10:01.168 --> 10:03.168
         So I got to be
        honest with you.

10:03.170 --> 10:06.738
      I don't give a damn
      what happens to you,

10:06.740 --> 10:08.907
    But if you got anything
  that can help me find pulpo,

10:08.909 --> 10:11.009
        It might be good
        for both of us.

10:16.949 --> 10:18.717
    - During pulpo's trial,

10:18.719 --> 10:20.719
  He asked where he could buy
    sets of new identities,

10:20.721 --> 10:24.956
       So I referred him
   to an old client of mine.

10:24.958 --> 10:26.858
       - What's his name?

10:26.860 --> 10:29.094
         Neil bunker--
     he's a notary public.

10:29.096 --> 10:32.297
    He's got a camera joint
        on north clark.

10:32.299 --> 10:34.966
    - Bunker's been arrested
         for everything

10:34.968 --> 10:37.002
      From bogus passports
 to counterfeit bulls tickets.

10:37.004 --> 10:40.739
   - So let's see if pulpo's
     left any bread crumbs.

10:40.741 --> 10:41.806
          - Hey there.

10:41.808 --> 10:43.775
            Welcome.

10:43.777 --> 10:45.844
           Officers.

10:45.846 --> 10:47.278
      How can I help you?

10:47.280 --> 10:48.880
        - Recognize him?

10:48.882 --> 10:50.415
             - No.

10:50.417 --> 10:52.117
          - You sure?
           - Mm-hmm.

10:52.119 --> 10:53.685
    - Don't worry about him.

10:53.687 --> 10:54.853
     We heard if someone's
    looking for clean I.D.S

10:54.855 --> 10:58.990
       - You want to get
some pictures developed, great.

10:58.992 --> 11:00.425
        But otherwise--

11:00.427 --> 11:01.793
             - Mm.

11:01.795 --> 11:03.762
            You sure
    you don't recognize him?

11:03.764 --> 11:04.763
             - No.
             - No?

11:04.765 --> 11:07.432
      - What kind of shop
     are you running here?

11:07.434 --> 11:11.269
   - It's just a photo shop.
   That's what we do--photos.

11:14.340 --> 11:17.842
 I don't know what to tell you.
     - Bring him back here.

11:17.844 --> 11:20.011
            Come on.

11:31.957 --> 11:33.158
          - So what's
     this little operation?

11:33.160 --> 11:37.929
           - No, I--
         no, I--this--

11:37.931 --> 11:39.164
   - Looks like somebody got
           a haircut.

11:39.166 --> 11:42.901
        [camera beeping]

11:42.903 --> 11:46.471
           Got pulpo.

11:46.473 --> 11:49.841
          [both grunt]

11:49.843 --> 11:55.346
   - Okay, let's start over.

11:55.348 --> 11:56.915
         Where's pulpo?

11:56.917 --> 11:59.818
      - I know who he is.

11:59.820 --> 12:02.320
       I'm not having him
         come after me.

12:02.322 --> 12:04.122
          You're gonna
       have to arrest me.

12:04.124 --> 12:08.093
      - Who said anything
         about arrest?

12:08.095 --> 12:10.929
     I mean, all I know is,

12:10.931 --> 12:12.931
        You took a shot
      at a police officer.

12:12.933 --> 12:14.833
            - What?

12:24.844 --> 12:26.044
         - Pick it up.

12:31.083 --> 12:31.316
               .

12:31.318 --> 12:34.385
         - Pick it up.
     Go ahead, pick it up.

12:34.387 --> 12:36.354
      - Don't look at me.

12:36.356 --> 12:38.923
           - Listen,
     you have two choices.

12:38.925 --> 12:42.227
     You can shoot your way
          out of here,

12:42.229 --> 12:46.231
       Or you can tell me
          about pulpo.

12:46.233 --> 12:49.000
          - I made him
      three sets of I.D.S

12:49.002 --> 12:50.468
  And a couple of credit cards
           to match.

12:50.470 --> 12:53.004
- Was he with a woman and a kid?
             - Yes.

12:53.006 --> 12:54.105
     - And you have no idea
      where they're going?

12:54.107 --> 12:55.373
             - No.
     - Yeah, of course not.

12:55.375 --> 12:57.075
         - No, I swear.

12:57.077 --> 13:00.211
           - [sighs]

13:00.213 --> 13:01.446
       Hey, take him in.

13:01.448 --> 13:03.114
           Book him.
            - Yeah.

13:03.116 --> 13:04.115
     - Aiding and abetting.

13:04.117 --> 13:06.084
        - But I talked.

13:06.086 --> 13:08.086
       - Not fast enough.

13:08.088 --> 13:09.487
  - Anything off the p.O.D.S?

13:09.489 --> 13:11.356
           - [sighs]

13:11.358 --> 13:12.991
        No, but I've got
       every electric eye

13:12.993 --> 13:14.359
     In the city wide open.

13:14.361 --> 13:17.395
 - What about the sumner thing?

13:17.397 --> 13:18.530
        - What about it?

13:18.532 --> 13:19.798
          - I told you
       to look into her.

13:19.800 --> 13:21.065
   You getting stupid on me?

13:21.067 --> 13:23.568
         - Uh, no. No.

13:23.570 --> 13:25.203
             Yeah.

13:25.205 --> 13:26.504
             Here.

13:26.506 --> 13:29.474
     I pulled all her calls
       in the last week.

13:29.476 --> 13:31.476
  - Any with internal affairs?

13:31.478 --> 13:34.379
     - Um, I think she made
     three calls over there

13:34.381 --> 13:36.981
     To a edwin stillwell.

13:40.452 --> 13:42.220
          I don't know
  what they're about, though.

13:42.222 --> 13:45.256
            I mean,
 she might have a case pending.

13:45.258 --> 13:48.860
    - Went to the bathroom.
   - Fixing her makeup, huh?

13:48.862 --> 13:50.261
            - Maybe.
       - How's he doing?

13:50.263 --> 13:53.498
           - Resting.
        He's a fighter.

13:55.201 --> 13:58.136
           - Combos.

13:58.138 --> 14:00.505
     - Hi. Thanks so much.

14:00.507 --> 14:01.539
      The kids love those.

14:01.541 --> 14:03.341
          - No biggie.
         How you doing?

14:03.343 --> 14:05.343
      - Hanging in there.
            - Good.

14:05.345 --> 14:07.412
           - Thanks.

14:15.287 --> 14:19.991
          - You know,
I've known your dad a long time.

14:19.993 --> 14:21.292
            We were
    on the same patrol unit

14:21.294 --> 14:24.028
   Back when he was a rookie.

14:24.030 --> 14:26.231
    And we went on this call
           one time,

14:26.233 --> 14:28.433
       Chased this dealer
      into a crack house.

14:28.435 --> 14:31.302
 He shot at us through the door
        with a 12-gauge.

14:31.304 --> 14:34.472
      I got hit in the hip
         and went down.

14:34.474 --> 14:38.109
       And this bad guy,
 he would have finished me off,

14:38.111 --> 14:41.279
         But your dad,
 he ran over and picked me up.

14:41.281 --> 14:42.380
       - He carried you?

14:42.382 --> 14:44.382
           - He did.

14:44.384 --> 14:46.217
     I was a little thinner
           back then.

14:46.219 --> 14:48.553
  So they plucked the buckshot
           out of me,

14:48.555 --> 14:51.322
       And they stuck me
         behind a desk.

14:51.324 --> 14:53.458
        But if it wasn't
        for your dad...

14:59.933 --> 15:01.466
           - Uh-huh.

15:01.468 --> 15:02.901
   All right, keep us posted.

15:02.903 --> 15:04.302

15:04.304 --> 15:05.670
           - Anything
     on lina's mom's house?

15:05.672 --> 15:08.006
    - No, zip, but I've got
    a couple of undercovers

15:08.008 --> 15:10.241
    Parked down the street.

15:14.480 --> 15:18.049
      - At the hospital--

15:18.051 --> 15:22.353
    I've never heard voight
     talk about his father.

15:22.355 --> 15:26.124
    - Nothing you can't find
   in the <i> sun-times</i> archives.

15:26.126 --> 15:27.992
     - You lived with him.

15:27.994 --> 15:31.496
       Is that every time
 a cop gets shot in this city,

15:31.498 --> 15:34.499
          Voight gets
   that same look in his eye.

           to voight?

        - How you doing?

28:20.765 --> 28:23.000
     - I'm dying of thirst.

28:30.442 --> 28:32.342
              Mmm.

28:39.017 --> 28:42.352
             - Hey.

28:42.354 --> 28:44.121
          We got him.

28:46.891 --> 28:49.860
       - I didn't see it
          on the news.

28:49.862 --> 28:52.296
    - I'm not sure you will.

28:52.298 --> 28:55.899
             - Oh.

28:55.901 --> 28:58.936
          [footsteps,
    indistinct conversation]

28:58.938 --> 29:01.405
           Come here.

29:06.244 --> 29:09.379
       The guy who killed
       olinsky's partner,

29:09.381 --> 29:12.483
           Browning--

29:12.485 --> 29:16.453
    Supposedly they took him
  to the docks on river road.

29:18.490 --> 29:20.224
        - And did what?

29:20.226 --> 29:22.993
  - Took him for a boat ride.

29:24.462 --> 29:27.998
              Jay,

29:28.000 --> 29:32.402
     I want pulpo punished
        for what he did,

29:32.404 --> 29:35.839
     But I don't want that
       on my conscience.

29:35.841 --> 29:37.207
            Do you?

29:42.947 --> 29:45.015
     - Feels like deja vu.

29:48.553 --> 29:51.088
       - A little, yeah.

29:59.998 --> 30:04.535
  - You know, I was never sure
     if you killed browning

30:04.537 --> 30:06.870
        Because of eddie
   or because you were trying

30:06.872 --> 30:10.140
           To make up
        for your father.

30:11.910 --> 30:15.813
   - He murdered our partner.

30:15.815 --> 30:17.414
            - Yeah.

30:17.416 --> 30:21.518
  - What happened to my father
   had nothing to do with it.

30:21.520 --> 30:23.854
         - Browning...

30:27.325 --> 30:30.394
     He ever keep you awake
           at night?

30:33.364 --> 30:35.966
     - I sleep like a baby.

30:37.569 --> 30:39.903
           - [sighs]

30:41.539 --> 30:46.910
  Well, I haven't slept right
          in 20 years.

30:46.912 --> 30:51.248
      - That's not 'cause
      we killed browning.

30:51.250 --> 30:52.883
     It's 'cause he killed
         your partner,

30:52.885 --> 30:55.085
     And you weren't there
          to stop it.

30:59.157 --> 31:02.059
           - [sighs]

31:02.061 --> 31:03.861
              Yep.

31:08.533 --> 31:12.903
           All right,
  so have we learned anything?

31:12.905 --> 31:13.971
  - He's gonna die in prison.

31:13.973 --> 31:15.639
     We're just speeding up
          the process.

31:15.641 --> 31:18.909
          - [chuckles]

31:21.212 --> 31:22.446
           - Come on.

31:22.448 --> 31:24.481
           It's time.

31:24.483 --> 31:27.050

      - [muffled shouting]

32:11.629 --> 32:13.397
           - Get up.

32:18.503 --> 32:20.570
           I got him.

32:23.374 --> 32:26.276
            Shut up.

32:26.278 --> 32:29.346
       [chains clanking]

32:31.149 --> 32:33.450
      You ever go swimming
    with a chicago necklace?

32:33.452 --> 32:37.220
       [muffled shouting]

32:43.528 --> 32:46.263
           [muffled]
              no!

32:48.033 --> 32:50.968
      Oh, no! No! No! No!

32:50.970 --> 32:53.637
              No!

        [muffled scream]

32:58.376 --> 33:01.545
      [muffled screaming]

33:11.289 --> 33:12.689
      - You can't do this.

33:12.691 --> 33:16.526
   - You went to see antonio.

33:18.096 --> 33:21.298
     What antonio wants...

33:21.300 --> 33:26.269
    And what pulpo deserves
   are two different things.

33:27.472 --> 33:28.739
   - We need to turn him in.

33:28.741 --> 33:31.008
    - He dies right here...

33:31.010 --> 33:33.243
           Right now.

33:36.481 --> 33:38.682

           [coughing]

33:40.285 --> 33:41.418
      - Whoa, whoa, whoa.
      Wait. Wait a second.

33:41.420 --> 33:44.021
         Wait a second.

33:44.023 --> 33:46.790
     The kid's right, man.
      We got him. We won.

33:46.792 --> 33:49.659
            - Alvin.
        - No, not now...

       [car door closes,
      engine turning over]

35:09.407 --> 35:11.675
         - Hey, sarge,
     you wanted to see us?

35:11.677 --> 35:15.178
            - Yeah.

35:15.180 --> 35:17.414
       You may have heard
      we have a spot open.

          - No doubt.

35:45.676 --> 35:49.279
     - Sir, can I ask why?

35:49.281 --> 35:51.748
   - You didn't make the cut?

35:51.750 --> 35:55.418
  You're good police, burgess.

35:55.420 --> 35:59.356
     I just don't tolerate
      in-house romance...

35:59.358 --> 36:01.858
   Especially from a uniform
      who should be doing

36:01.860 --> 36:03.260
  Everything she can to prove

36:03.262 --> 36:06.897
     She's fully committed
          to the job.

36:06.899 --> 36:09.266
          - No, it's--
          - dismissed.

     since I've been here.

37:10.963 --> 37:13.930
      You know, everything
  that happened to antonio...

37:17.235 --> 37:19.970
  Made me start thinking a lot
          about eddie.

37:19.972 --> 37:23.506
      After he was killed,

37:23.508 --> 37:27.277
    I put a lot of distance
      between me and you.

37:32.717 --> 37:35.418
     - Alvin, are you okay?

37:35.420 --> 37:39.356
      - [breathing deeply]

37:39.358 --> 37:42.592

         - You're late.

38:01.980 --> 38:03.780
       - I got caught up
        with something.

38:03.782 --> 38:05.482
      - And what is that?

38:05.484 --> 38:06.916
   - I thought it'd be nice.

38:06.918 --> 38:08.385
     - For a five-year-old.

38:08.387 --> 38:10.053
         Travis is 12.

38:10.055 --> 38:11.688
        And I told you,
     you can't just invoke

38:11.690 --> 38:15.425
        Your father-son
      privileges already.

38:15.427 --> 38:16.559

38:39.384 --> 38:40.950
          - Urlacher.

38:40.952 --> 38:43.086
     That's a good choice.

38:43.088 --> 38:44.521
      But I'm old school.

38:44.523 --> 38:47.657
     Can't beat singletary.

38:47.659 --> 38:49.793
         Your mom still
         a packers fan?

38:49.795 --> 38:51.094

         Do you owe me?

39:33.805 --> 39:36.506
       - Are you kidding?

39:36.508 --> 39:40.043
     Do you have something
        cooking already?

39:40.045 --> 39:41.111
   Don't blow this, charlie.

39:41.113 --> 39:42.679
          - Yes or no?

39:42.681 --> 39:44.948
         Do you owe me?

39:48.819 --> 39:51.955
         - Yeah, sure.

39:51.957 --> 39:53.757
         - Good answer.

40:13.144 --> 40:15.512
             - Hey.

40:15.514 --> 40:17.147
 Let me have another manhattan.

40:21.986 --> 40:24.788
        - Two of those.
         - You got it.

40:31.962 --> 40:33.663
         - You're gonna
       hear me out first.

40:33.665 --> 40:37.567
      - I deal with things
         in the moment.

40:37.569 --> 40:41.471
    I make the best decision
          that I can.

40:41.473 --> 40:43.640
      Sometimes I'm right.

40:45.676 --> 40:49.512
      Sometimes I'm wrong.

40:51.749 --> 40:55.585
       And I accept that,

40:55.587 --> 40:57.120
      And I move forward,

40:57.122 --> 41:00.190
  Knowing I did the best I can

41:00.192 --> 41:02.959
     To protect this city.

41:16.707 --> 41:19.676
     I have my convictions,

41:19.678 --> 41:23.480
    And I don't give a damn
  what anybody thinks of 'em.

41:25.549 --> 41:30.019
  You have yours as well, jay.

41:30.021 --> 41:33.790
          I know that.

41:33.792 --> 41:36.125
      And I respect that.
