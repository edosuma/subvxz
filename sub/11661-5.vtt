(mellow music playing)

01:03.400 --> 01:04.300
(door opens)

01:05.266 --> 01:06.333
Hi, Sophia.

01:06.400 --> 01:11.066
There's nothing more invigorating
than spending time on a boat.

01:11.400 --> 01:14.100
Not when I sailed to America.

01:14.166 --> 01:19.133
Picture it, there we were, a tired,
poor, huddled mass,

01:19.200 --> 01:21.467
eating marinara sauce out of a can.

01:22.233 --> 01:23.400
It was hell.

01:23.934 --> 01:27.667
And the entertainment, some guy
from Palermo forgot his accordion,

01:27.734 --> 01:30.967
so he sang "O Sole Mio"
while squeezing a monkey.

01:33.066 --> 01:34.133
Sophia.

01:34.200 --> 01:35.500
Sophia what?

01:35.567 --> 01:37.233
It was terrible.

01:37.300 --> 01:39.000
If it weren't for pin the tail
on the French,

01:39.066 --> 01:40.800
we would have gone crazy.

01:43.367 --> 01:44.266
Hi, Sophia.

01:44.333 --> 01:47.800
I told Sophia what a wonderful day we had.

01:47.867 --> 01:49.900
Wonderful my foot.

01:50.266 --> 01:54.567
Blanche, you saw that dolphin
all tangled up in that tuna boat's net.

01:54.633 --> 01:58.467
Thousands of them die that way.
We have to do something.

01:58.533 --> 01:59.967
You're right.

02:00.033 --> 02:02.367
From this moment on, no more tuna fish.

02:04.367 --> 02:06.233
Blanche, you hate tuna fish.

02:06.300 --> 02:08.667
All right, then no more tuna fishermen.

02:12.500 --> 02:15.367
Girls, do these pearls look okay
with this?

02:15.433 --> 02:21.066
Pearls look fine with everything,
from the fanciest dress to... that.

02:25.600 --> 02:27.900
You have another date with Ken.

02:27.967 --> 02:29.567
Sophia, do you believe it?

02:29.633 --> 02:33.600
I thought my head was spinning
from the vino in my lemonade.

02:34.800 --> 02:37.467
You don't put wine in your lemonade.

02:38.300 --> 02:39.000
No.

02:39.400 --> 02:41.333
You're right. I don't.
It was a joke. Ha-ha.

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
Your Ken's quite a catch.

02:46.066 --> 02:47.700
For once, I'm slightly jealous.

02:47.767 --> 02:49.433
What's not to be jealous about?

02:49.500 --> 02:52.066
He's got money and class.

02:52.133 --> 02:54.166
I couldn't be happier for Dorothy.

02:54.667 --> 02:59.066
I want to give you a mother's advice,
don't blow it!

03:01.066 --> 03:05.700
Ma, I have no intention of blowing this.
Ken is perfect!

03:05.767 --> 03:09.900
Aside from being one
of Miami's most successful lawyers,

03:09.967 --> 03:11.000
thank you, Ma.

03:11.967 --> 03:14.600
The man is caring, he's sensitive.

03:14.667 --> 03:15.767
Do you know that on weekends,

03:15.834 --> 03:21.300
he puts on a clown's costume
and entertains sick kids at the hospital?

03:21.367 --> 03:25.266
-(doorbell rings)
-What more could I want from a man?

03:25.333 --> 03:27.166
Get it out of the gutter, Blanche.

03:31.700 --> 03:33.133
-Dorothy.
-Sweetheart.

03:33.200 --> 03:34.133
How was your day?

03:34.200 --> 03:38.233
My ulcer didn't flare up,
so I guess it's perfect.

03:38.300 --> 03:39.467
-Hi, Ken.
-Hi, Ken.

03:39.533 --> 03:43.200
What's a nice boy like you
doing with ulcers?

03:43.266 --> 03:47.900
You got a girl who'll do anything for you.
You will, won't you, Dorothy?

03:49.667 --> 03:51.867
I'll take that as "Have a good time."

03:51.934 --> 03:55.200
I'll have your little girl home
at a reasonable hour.

03:55.266 --> 03:58.533
Don't bother. I won't wait up.

03:58.600 --> 04:00.266
Be back by Tuesday.

04:00.333 --> 04:02.066
(laughs)

04:02.133 --> 04:03.533
No questions asked.

04:04.734 --> 04:06.133
She's going to blow it.

04:07.400 --> 04:10.734
(mellow music playing)

04:11.400 --> 04:14.367
See you at the rally on Pier 5.

04:14.433 --> 04:16.867
Oh,
the dolphins will really appreciate it.

04:17.567 --> 04:21.300
Oh, isn't this exciting,
taking part in a protest,

04:21.367 --> 04:24.934
standing up as free Americans,
exercising our right to say,

04:25.000 --> 04:27.500
"We're mad as hell.
We won't take it anymore."

04:28.400 --> 04:30.567
I'm out of spit. Can I go now?

04:32.633 --> 04:34.934
20 envelopes, and you're quitting?

04:35.000 --> 04:38.033
We joined friends of sea mammals
for a reason.

04:38.100 --> 04:40.000
You are so unmotivated.

04:40.066 --> 04:40.967
Well...

04:41.033 --> 04:44.066
When I joined these mammals
with blow holes thing...

04:46.834 --> 04:50.834
I didn't expect to be carrying
picket signs on some grungy dock.

04:51.266 --> 04:54.867
I was hoping more
for a fund raiser cocktail party

04:54.934 --> 04:57.633
with Chinese lanterns and Portuguese,

04:57.700 --> 05:01.066
no, Hispanic waiters in tight black pants.

05:02.934 --> 05:05.867
And we'd hire a band to play fish songs

05:05.934 --> 05:09.233
in pirate suits with muscles bulging.

05:19.800 --> 05:22.900
Your mouth is watering now, Blanche.
Keep licking.

05:26.700 --> 05:27.567
(sighs)

05:29.500 --> 05:30.600
Hi, girls.

05:30.667 --> 05:31.867
You two are back early.

05:32.467 --> 05:34.033
Of course, we're back early.

05:34.100 --> 05:35.266
Ken called.

05:35.333 --> 05:39.100
He needs to talk to Dorothy
about something very important.

05:39.166 --> 05:40.033
Dorothy!

05:40.100 --> 05:41.834
He's going to pop the question!

05:41.900 --> 05:43.300
I don't know that.

05:43.367 --> 05:45.433
What else could it be?

05:45.500 --> 05:47.100
Oh, honey, congratulations.

05:47.166 --> 05:49.133
You're more excited than I am.

05:49.200 --> 05:51.333
Well, why not, Dorothy?

05:51.400 --> 05:55.266
Life with a successful attorney,
the summer homes,

05:55.333 --> 05:57.100
the glamorous social circles,

05:57.166 --> 06:02.000
those impulsive little trips to Europe
with rascally romans pinching your bottom.

06:04.467 --> 06:07.133
You're a lucky girl, Dorothy. I hate you.

06:09.500 --> 06:11.467
Oh, this is just crazy talk.

06:11.533 --> 06:14.667
We've only been seeing each other
three months.

06:14.734 --> 06:18.667
I've never even thought
about being Mrs. Kenneth Whittingham.

06:20.600 --> 06:22.467
Has a nice ring to it.

06:22.533 --> 06:23.633
(doorbell rings)

06:23.700 --> 06:25.200
Go get him, pussycat.

06:25.500 --> 06:27.467
Remember, you and I come as a package.

06:27.533 --> 06:28.600
Ma!

06:33.934 --> 06:34.600
Hi.

06:35.834 --> 06:38.567
Sweetheart, I am so excited.

06:39.066 --> 06:39.834
Oh?

06:39.900 --> 06:42.266
I've come to a major decision.

06:42.333 --> 06:43.233
Oh?

06:45.166 --> 06:47.967
It's a decision that affects both of us.

06:48.033 --> 06:48.967
Oh.

06:52.066 --> 06:52.734
Sit down.

06:54.767 --> 06:56.533
Close your eyes. I'll give you a hint.

06:57.233 --> 06:58.367
Okey-dokey.

07:06.266 --> 07:06.934
Well?

07:08.433 --> 07:10.367
Can you guess what my decision is?

07:10.867 --> 07:12.734
You're becoming Irish?

07:14.800 --> 07:15.467
No.

07:15.834 --> 07:19.233
I'm becoming a clown,
a full-time circus clown.

07:20.333 --> 07:25.767
Ken, isn't this a bit sudden,
odd and a bit sudden?

07:26.734 --> 07:27.400
No.

07:27.467 --> 07:30.533
I've done it for years
at children's hospitals.

07:30.600 --> 07:34.667
It's been the one bright spot in my life,
that and you.

07:35.266 --> 07:39.433
Dorothy, I've been lawyering
70 hours a week since I was 25.

07:40.000 --> 07:40.900
It changes a man.

07:40.967 --> 07:43.166
Yes, but you're so successful.

07:43.233 --> 07:45.767
I'm also 60, and I'm miserable.

07:46.300 --> 07:50.100
I went to law school
so I could fight for the little guy.

07:51.433 --> 07:54.100
Now I'm fighting
for multinational corporations.

07:54.567 --> 07:59.166
I'm so frazzled, I sneak into the washroom
to make balloon giraffes.

08:01.233 --> 08:04.767
Dorothy, I really need you
to understand this.

08:05.133 --> 08:06.767
I've been thinking a lot lately.

08:07.633 --> 08:09.800
We're in this for the long haul.

08:10.667 --> 08:13.567
Dorothy, I think this is going to be
a very serious relationship.

08:20.533 --> 08:22.767
I feel like a virgin.
Where do the noses go?

08:22.834 --> 08:23.767
I'm sorry.

08:30.867 --> 08:31.633
What do you say?

08:32.233 --> 08:34.266
-You with me?
-Of course.

08:34.333 --> 08:35.867
-Oh, great.
-(sighs)

08:35.934 --> 08:39.367
Then how about a celebration?
I'm having dinner with circus friends.

08:39.433 --> 08:40.166
Join me?

08:40.233 --> 08:41.600
Might as well get my feet wet.

08:41.667 --> 08:45.533
Ken, there won't be a dozen tiny dogs

08:45.600 --> 08:48.500
hopping on hind legs wearing funny hats?

08:48.967 --> 08:50.934
Oh, I wish.

08:53.834 --> 08:56.867
(mellow music playing)

09:00.867 --> 09:03.834
Come on, tell me.
Was last night a disaster?

09:03.900 --> 09:05.667
It wasn't a disaster.

09:05.734 --> 09:08.166
It was just uncomfortable.

09:08.233 --> 09:10.467
I tried to find common ground.

09:10.533 --> 09:13.367
Something I could talk
to Ken's circus friends about.

09:13.433 --> 09:17.100
But the human cannonball
doesn't do much reading.

09:20.967 --> 09:22.467
Does Ken know how you feel?

09:22.533 --> 09:26.834
He asked me if I had a good time.
I had to tell him the truth.

09:27.367 --> 09:31.467
I just didn't fit in
with the other clowns' wives.

09:34.133 --> 09:36.100
Dorothy, I've been thinking,

09:36.166 --> 09:39.533
it might help you
get your mind off Ken for a while.

09:39.600 --> 09:41.533
Join us at the rally.

09:41.600 --> 09:44.000
-No, Rose.
-Oh, do.

09:44.066 --> 09:45.700
Get out of yourself.

09:45.767 --> 09:47.700
It's for a noble cause.

09:47.767 --> 09:52.100
Or would you rather wallow in self-pity?

09:53.300 --> 09:55.300
-You're right. I'll do it.
-Good.

09:55.367 --> 09:57.100
Rose, Dorothy is taking my place.

10:01.200 --> 10:03.100
There you are, pussycat.

10:03.166 --> 10:05.500
Ken gave you a ring, didn't he?

10:05.567 --> 10:06.867
Yeah. Three of them.

10:09.800 --> 10:14.300
I don't know how to say this,
so I'll just give it to you straight.

10:15.567 --> 10:17.000
Ken is becoming a clown.

10:19.200 --> 10:19.900
<i>Scusi?</i>

10:21.667 --> 10:24.800
He's tired of being a lawyer.
He's joining the circus.

10:25.266 --> 10:27.233
What did you do to him?

10:28.600 --> 10:30.133
I didn't do anything.

10:30.200 --> 10:31.367
Yeah. Right.

10:31.433 --> 10:34.700
One day he's a lawyer, then he's a clown.

10:34.767 --> 10:37.300
Ma, please. This is hard enough.

10:37.367 --> 10:38.600
Oh, I'm sorry, sweetheart.

10:38.667 --> 10:42.000
I tend to get upset
when people ruin my life!

10:44.266 --> 10:47.066
I don't know what the hullabaloo is about.

10:47.133 --> 10:50.500
Dating a clown
would be a dream come true for me.

10:55.233 --> 10:57.400
Reach for the stars, Rose.

10:58.967 --> 11:00.166
No, it would.

11:00.233 --> 11:05.266
Think about it, seeing him push
those pigs around in a baby carriage,

11:06.433 --> 11:09.867
getting hit with a bucket of confetti
any time you want,

11:11.100 --> 11:13.033
and sitting there in the stands,

11:13.100 --> 11:16.734
watching him sweep that spotlight
into a little circle

11:16.800 --> 11:19.734
and thinking, that's my man.

11:23.066 --> 11:25.066
Whew. It's getting hot in here.

11:30.867 --> 11:32.433
Why did this have to happen

11:32.500 --> 11:36.767
just when I meet someone,
I may have a future with?

11:37.367 --> 11:39.700
I know I should be more supportive,

11:39.767 --> 11:43.100
but the fact is, I'm embarrassed.

11:43.166 --> 11:46.934
Don't be ridiculous, Dorothy.
You love the man for who he is.

11:47.333 --> 11:51.934
It's not like he's driving you around
in a tiny car with a key on back.

11:54.133 --> 11:54.934
Is he?

11:56.200 --> 11:57.934
(doorbell rings)

11:59.000 --> 11:59.867
(sighs)

12:01.834 --> 12:02.633
Hi, sweetheart.

12:02.700 --> 12:05.033
You're driving the Lincoln tonight, right?

12:05.100 --> 12:06.033
Sure.

12:08.233 --> 12:11.734
Oh, two things,
we're doubling with Phil and Nancy,

12:11.800 --> 12:13.100
two things you have to remember.

12:13.166 --> 12:15.333
Call them little people.

12:17.433 --> 12:19.734
And they hate being patted on the head.

12:19.800 --> 12:21.300
I found out the hard way.

12:23.567 --> 12:24.800
Kenny, come here.

12:25.533 --> 12:26.834
What's with this clown business?

12:26.900 --> 12:29.633
Couldn't you be a lawyer
and hang out with clowns?

12:29.700 --> 12:34.567
I know it's odd, but I'm burned out.

12:34.633 --> 12:38.100
I'll contribute more to the world
in red shoes,

12:38.166 --> 12:41.934
a spinning tie,
and an umbrella that rains on me.

12:42.400 --> 12:43.633
I see.

12:45.433 --> 12:47.000
Dorothy, eh...

12:50.300 --> 12:52.133
What did you do to him?

12:53.200 --> 12:56.266
(mellow music playing)

12:57.133 --> 12:59.934
(quirky music playing)

13:00.767 --> 13:03.400
We may not agree with the fishermen

13:03.467 --> 13:06.600
but we want this demonstration
to be peaceful.

13:06.667 --> 13:08.200
In the tradition of...

13:10.633 --> 13:15.133
You know, the short, bald Indian fellow
with the glasses and the diaper.

13:17.533 --> 13:19.800
You know, the one who didn't eat
and won an Oscar.

13:21.467 --> 13:24.500
Your sign's drooping again.
What's the matter?

13:24.567 --> 13:25.467
It's Ken.

13:26.033 --> 13:28.300
He called me this morning.

13:28.367 --> 13:30.834
He wants me to travel with the circus.

13:31.467 --> 13:33.500
I'm afraid we're going to have
to call it quits.

13:33.567 --> 13:36.700
Honey, I'd think twice about that.

13:36.767 --> 13:40.066
At your age,
how many chances do you have left?

13:41.633 --> 13:44.934
All creatures must learn to coexist.

13:45.400 --> 13:47.533
Back where I come from, they do.

13:49.200 --> 13:51.200
That's why the brown bear

13:51.266 --> 13:56.467
and the field mouse can share
their lives and live in harmony.

13:56.533 --> 13:59.033
Of course, they can't mate,
or the mice would explode.

14:09.200 --> 14:10.533
Well, you know what I mean.

14:11.266 --> 14:14.000
I think Rose needs work on her metaphors.

14:14.967 --> 14:18.000
Honey, I know you're depressed,
but I'm glad you came.

14:18.066 --> 14:20.333
I want to make a difference today.

14:20.400 --> 14:22.066
Blanche, I am impressed.

14:22.133 --> 14:24.333
You've really changed your tune.

14:24.400 --> 14:26.200
It's funny how that happened.

14:26.266 --> 14:31.033
There I was staying up last night,
making up excuses to get out of this.

14:31.100 --> 14:34.834
Then I told myself, "Water Lily..."

14:35.333 --> 14:37.367
-That's what I call myself sometimes.
-Ah.

14:40.800 --> 14:44.033
"Water Lily, you've never done
anything like this before.

14:44.100 --> 14:45.433
This is important.

14:45.500 --> 14:49.000
For the love of mother nature,

14:49.066 --> 14:51.500
commit yourself to this,
Blanche Devereaux."

14:51.567 --> 14:52.767
-Isn't that exciting?
-Mm-hm.

14:53.266 --> 14:56.033
Caught a rerun of <i>Flipper</i> on cable,
did you?

14:58.367 --> 15:03.166
A particularly touching one
where flipper comes to the rescue.

15:04.133 --> 15:06.667
It was only after that
I picked up Rose's pamphlets

15:06.734 --> 15:08.900
and read
about these magnificent creatures.

15:08.967 --> 15:10.400
That's beautiful.

15:10.467 --> 15:12.133
-Water Lily?
-Uh-huh.

15:13.266 --> 15:16.500
All right, dolphin people,
get away from the gate.

15:16.567 --> 15:20.734
-Watch it.
-Why can't you people see the light?

15:20.800 --> 15:24.033
Why can't you people see
another point of view?

15:24.100 --> 15:26.567
-Get away from here.
-Take your hands off.

15:26.633 --> 15:27.767
Let her go!

15:29.300 --> 15:30.567
(clamoring)

15:33.400 --> 15:36.800
(mellow music playing)

15:40.233 --> 15:43.967
(murmuring)

15:45.867 --> 15:47.500
Sweetheart, I'm here.

15:47.567 --> 15:50.333
Things got out of hand. I'm fine.

15:50.867 --> 15:53.233
Don't worry. I called Ken.
He's parking the car.

15:53.300 --> 15:56.800
Did you hear that? Ken's going to save us.

15:56.867 --> 16:00.400
Everybody,
we'll be out of here in no time.

16:00.467 --> 16:04.900
My mother called my boyfriend,
a top Miami lawyer.

16:04.967 --> 16:06.400
Nothing to worry about.

16:06.467 --> 16:07.867
We are in good hands.

16:16.266 --> 16:16.934
Oh.

16:17.500 --> 16:19.734
Dorothy, sweetheart, there you are.

16:19.800 --> 16:23.400
Ma, you didn't say he's in a clown suit.

16:23.867 --> 16:24.800
Oh, yeah.

16:26.367 --> 16:27.900
Ken, how could you?

16:27.967 --> 16:32.166
Sophia called me at rehearsal.
I wanted to make sure you're all right.

16:32.233 --> 16:33.400
(honk honk)

16:35.633 --> 16:37.834
Is the demonstrators' counsel present?

16:37.900 --> 16:39.734
-Here, Your Honor.
-Oh, God.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.767
Will the clown approach the bench?

16:44.066 --> 16:45.500
Dorothy, I can do this.

16:45.567 --> 16:47.767
-Without the nose?
-Yes.

16:52.633 --> 16:54.367
What are you trying to do?

16:54.433 --> 16:57.867
I know this looks odd,
but I'm a registered member of the bar.

16:57.934 --> 16:59.967
Here's my card.

17:06.467 --> 17:07.867
We're going to jail.

17:09.467 --> 17:12.667
I believe you, I believe you.
Just proceed.

17:12.734 --> 17:13.834
Make it quick.

17:15.000 --> 17:18.800
Your honor, this may be
my very last appearance before the bar.

17:18.867 --> 17:21.233
Would you indulge me?

17:21.934 --> 17:22.600
Thank you.

17:27.934 --> 17:32.166
You know, I have been practicing law
for many, many years,

17:32.934 --> 17:34.967
and it's always amazed me

17:35.000 --> 17:39.567
how little my job
actually had to do with justice.

17:40.400 --> 17:43.300
This stuff sounds better
with lapels and a vest.

17:45.233 --> 17:50.633
Anyway, my
clients are charged with trespass,

17:52.100 --> 17:54.600
but the only real crime they committed

17:54.667 --> 17:59.533
was their overzealous championing
of the defenseless dolphin.

18:00.500 --> 18:05.900
The dolphin, Your Honor, that for
centuries has rescued men lost at sea,

18:06.567 --> 18:08.433
guided ships back to port.

18:09.367 --> 18:12.467
No, my clients were not trespassing.

18:13.033 --> 18:15.633
My clients were returning the favor.

18:17.734 --> 18:21.667
They simply wanted to protect
some of nature's best creations

18:22.166 --> 18:23.133
from extinction.

18:25.166 --> 18:25.834
Your honor...

18:29.633 --> 18:33.400
you have the opportunity today
to make a very disillusioned lawyer happy.

18:34.266 --> 18:37.800
Please answer to a law higher
than this state's

18:37.867 --> 18:40.266
and dispense some real justice here.

18:40.333 --> 18:43.567
(applause, cheer)

18:43.633 --> 18:44.633
(thumping)

18:44.700 --> 18:47.166
Please, let's have a little quiet here.

18:48.834 --> 18:51.233
That was a great speech.

18:51.300 --> 18:52.433
Thank you, Your Honor.

18:52.500 --> 18:54.100
But help me out here.

18:54.500 --> 18:56.400
How about something from a law book?

18:56.867 --> 18:57.734
Okay.

18:57.800 --> 19:01.934
The fracas occurred on a seaside dock
abutting navigable waters.

19:02.000 --> 19:04.433
This court doesn't have any jurisdiction.

19:05.200 --> 19:06.633
That sounds legal to me.

19:07.934 --> 19:10.233
Your last day has been a good one.

19:10.900 --> 19:11.633
Case dismissed.

19:11.700 --> 19:14.100
(cheering)

19:17.834 --> 19:20.734
(mellow music playing)

19:22.467 --> 19:24.600
I want you two jailbirds to feel at home.

19:25.300 --> 19:27.100
Dinner's at 6:00. Pass it on.

19:30.200 --> 19:32.200
Rose, honey, what is the matter?

19:33.000 --> 19:35.900
We didn't accomplish anything today,
Blanche.

19:35.967 --> 19:38.967
Those fishermen
are going to be out there tomorrow

19:39.033 --> 19:40.200
doing the same thing.

19:40.266 --> 19:42.200
I feel like a failure.

19:42.266 --> 19:45.300
You can't change the world in one day.

19:45.367 --> 19:47.400
Think about what we did do.

19:47.467 --> 19:51.100
We saved dolphins
keeping that boat off the water.

19:51.567 --> 19:53.667
The next time
you're walking along the beach

19:53.734 --> 19:55.700
and see a school swim by,

19:55.767 --> 19:57.033
you can think,

19:57.100 --> 20:01.433
maybe I saved those gorgeous creatures
from those horrible nets.

20:03.734 --> 20:05.433
You still think we were a failure?

20:05.967 --> 20:06.867
You're right.

20:06.934 --> 20:09.300
I wish we could save them all.

20:09.367 --> 20:12.333
Let's go back to the dock.

20:12.400 --> 20:13.500
-Really?
-Sure.

20:13.567 --> 20:17.667
I know a waterfront bar
where a lot of foreign fishermen hang out.

20:19.233 --> 20:21.367
Would they be willing to listen to me?

20:21.433 --> 20:22.867
Sure, they will, honey.

20:22.934 --> 20:25.066
They don't speak English,
and they're horny.

20:28.934 --> 20:29.834
Where are you going?

20:29.900 --> 20:31.533
-To celebrate.
-To demonstrate.

20:34.867 --> 20:38.166
So, anything special
you want to do tonight?

20:39.567 --> 20:40.233
Ken...

20:42.233 --> 20:43.767
There is something.

20:45.767 --> 20:49.633
Dorothy, you know you have
the most beautiful eyes?

20:50.367 --> 20:51.934
And a quarter in your ear.

20:54.533 --> 20:55.900
We really have to talk.

20:55.967 --> 20:57.100
What's wrong?

20:57.166 --> 21:00.333
I don't know whether this is harder to say
or harder to hear.

21:02.000 --> 21:07.333
Ken, you're a lovable man
with a lot of lovable qualities, but...

21:08.066 --> 21:08.734
(sighs)

21:09.066 --> 21:10.233
I don't love you.

21:18.367 --> 21:20.200
It's this clown thing, isn't it?

21:21.033 --> 21:23.367
I thought that's what was bothering me,

21:23.433 --> 21:26.500
but if I loved you,
I'd follow you anywhere.

21:27.266 --> 21:28.166
I'm sorry.

21:29.367 --> 21:30.066
I see.

21:30.600 --> 21:36.166
I think we were both trying too hard
to make this work on our own terms,

21:36.233 --> 21:40.600
but I know that I am not prepared
to give up my life.

21:40.667 --> 21:44.033
Ken, could you give up the circus for me?

21:45.066 --> 21:47.066
Could you give up the laughter,

21:47.567 --> 21:50.533
the smiles on those children's faces?

21:51.066 --> 21:53.166
You know something, Dorothy?
I don't think I could.

21:54.266 --> 21:56.400
Could I give up the fat lady for you? No.

21:56.834 --> 22:01.333
Could I give up the chimps,
the sword swallower...

22:01.400 --> 22:04.166
Ken, I think I have a grip on this.

22:06.367 --> 22:10.633
I guess at our age,
we do a lot of wishful thinking.

22:11.200 --> 22:12.900
We did come close, though.

22:15.533 --> 22:18.800
If the circus is in town,
I'll leave the tent flap open for you.

22:20.367 --> 22:21.533
I'm going to miss you.

22:26.333 --> 22:27.400
(sniffles)

22:27.467 --> 22:28.200
(whimpers)

22:30.300 --> 22:30.967
(sniffles)

22:39.867 --> 22:43.734
(both laugh)

22:45.667 --> 22:48.667
(quirky music playing)

22:53.633 --> 22:56.633
(closing theme music playing)
