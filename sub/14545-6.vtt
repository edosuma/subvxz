WEBVTT

00:02.170 --> 00:04.772
(Tessa) AT THE RISK
OF SOUNDING POSITIVE,

00:04.805 --> 00:08.209
I LOVE IT WHEN IT RAINS
IN SUBURBIA.

00:08.242 --> 00:12.346
(man) * COULD BE WALKING IN
OUT OF THE RAIN *
(puddles splashing)

00:12.380 --> 00:15.416
* OR CATCHING THE SHADE
ON A SUNNY DAY *

00:15.449 --> 00:17.751
YOU DON'T HAVE TO WATER.

00:17.785 --> 00:20.821
IT'S ALREADY WATERING.

00:20.854 --> 00:22.623
* THE ANSWER ALWAYS IS
THE SAME *

00:22.656 --> 00:24.625
AT THE RISK OF SOUNDING
NEGATIVE,

00:24.658 --> 00:26.094
PEOPLE OUT HERE ARE STUPID...

00:28.196 --> 00:29.463
AND WASTEFUL.

00:29.497 --> 00:30.631
(clatters)

00:33.301 --> 00:34.635
(clattering)

00:34.668 --> 00:38.072
DO YOU GUYS EVER THINK ABOUT
HOW MUCH FOOD WE WASTE?

00:38.106 --> 00:39.573
IT'S NOT FOOD. IT'S GARBAGE.

00:39.607 --> 00:42.042
BUT IT'S NOT. LOOK.

00:43.777 --> 00:46.380
SHE'S DIGGING
THROUGH THE TRASH.
(dishes clanking)

00:46.414 --> 00:50.651
SEE? A PERFECTLY GOOD APPLE.
YOU CAN STILL EAT IT.

00:50.684 --> 00:53.321
YOU DO... EAT, DON'T YOU?

00:53.354 --> 00:58.259
WE EAT.

00:58.292 --> 01:01.129
I FEEL BLOATED.
LET'S WALK IT OFF.

01:01.162 --> 01:03.731
YEAH. GO BURN OFF THAT MINT.

01:05.533 --> 01:08.502
(crunches)

01:08.536 --> 01:10.571
I THINK I HAD PROVEN MY POINT.

01:10.604 --> 01:12.473
I HAD ALSO PROVEN
THAT THE 5-SECOND RULE

01:12.506 --> 01:13.507
IS TOO GENEROUS WHEN IT COMES
TO PRODUCE FROM THE TRASH.

01:16.710 --> 01:20.281
SO, TESSA, THINGS GOOD?

01:20.314 --> 01:22.750
YOU SETTLING IN,
MAKING FRIENDS?

01:22.783 --> 01:24.418
NO UNWANTED PREGNANCIES
I SHOULD KNOW ABOUT?

01:24.452 --> 01:26.354
NOPE. I AM WITHOUT BABY.

01:26.387 --> 01:30.324
GREAT, THEN I WILL MARK YOU
DOWN AS COUNSELED,

01:30.358 --> 01:31.692
AND WE'LL HAVE
ANOTHER PERSONAL INTERACTION

01:31.725 --> 01:32.526
IN TWO MORE MONTHS.

01:32.560 --> 01:33.894
WORKS FOR ME.

01:36.364 --> 01:38.699
YOU KNOW... (sighs)
THIS KIND OF COMPLACENCY

01:38.732 --> 01:40.468
REALLY TICKS ME OFF.
WHAT?

01:40.501 --> 01:43.137
I ASKED FOR CHICKEN AND STARS,
NOT CHICKEN AND RICE.

01:43.171 --> 01:44.272
(sloshes)

01:44.305 --> 01:45.373
IT'S A PANDEMIC.

01:45.406 --> 01:46.507
CAFETERIA INCOMPETENCE?

01:46.540 --> 01:48.376
WASTEFULNESS.

01:48.409 --> 01:50.278
YOU GUYS THROW OUT
A LOT OF FOOD.

01:50.311 --> 01:51.479
THAT SOUP WAS WRONG.

01:51.512 --> 01:53.414
IF IT WAS RIGHT,
I WOULD HAVE EATEN IT.

01:53.447 --> 01:55.549
TOTALLY.

01:55.583 --> 01:57.918
I'M JUST SAYING,
PEOPLE WHO THROW OUT RICE

01:57.951 --> 02:00.421
FOR NOT BEING STARS
MIGHT HAVE MORE

02:00.454 --> 02:02.390
THAN THEY ACTUALLY NEED...

02:02.423 --> 02:03.591
I SEE.

02:03.624 --> 02:06.327
SO MAYBE...
MAYBE THE SCHOOL COULD DONATE

02:06.360 --> 02:08.196
THE EXTRA FOOD TO THE NEEDY
INSTEAD OF DUMPING IT.

02:08.229 --> 02:10.798
THE NEEDY--IS THAT
WITH A "Y" OR AN "I-E"?

02:10.831 --> 02:12.200
THE NEEDY?
THEY'RE WITH A "Y."

02:14.735 --> 02:18.406
NEEDY. PEOPLE WHO NEED.

02:18.439 --> 02:19.640
NEED.

02:19.673 --> 02:22.576
FOOD, CLOTHING, HELP.

02:22.610 --> 02:24.412
TESSA, DO YOU KNOW
WHAT THIS IS?

02:24.445 --> 02:25.613
A DRAMATIC MOOD SHIFT?

02:25.646 --> 02:27.881
TEACHABLE MOMENT,
A CAUSE THAT THE STUDENTS

02:27.915 --> 02:30.284
CAN GET INVOLVED IN,
AND YOU CAN SPEARHEAD.

02:30.318 --> 02:32.420
I DON'T NORMALLY SPEARHEAD.

02:55.843 --> 02:58.679
WE GOT THE TOWEL WARMERS.
WE GOT A HEATED FLOOR.

02:58.712 --> 03:00.514
UH, WE GOT THE BIDET.
THAT'S FOR JILL,

03:00.548 --> 03:02.883
THOUGH SHE NEVER USES IT,
THOUGH SHE SHOULD.

HADN'T SHARED THAT.

03:04.685 --> 03:06.654
(chuckles)
WE GOT THE INFINITY BATHTUB.

03:06.687 --> 03:09.257
WE GOT
THE JAPANESE TALKING TOILET,

03:09.290 --> 03:13.427

AND I'M TALKING
SQUEAKY CLEAN.

03:19.533 --> 03:21.569
WELL, WHAT CAN I SAY? IT'S A--
IT'S A KILLER BATHROOM, MAN.

03:21.602 --> 03:23.837
YES, SHE IS, BUT DO YOU KNOW
THE ONE THING SHE'S MISSING?

03:23.871 --> 03:25.439
MODESTY?

03:25.473 --> 03:27.475
(chuckles) A SKYLIGHT.
THAT'S WHY I CALLED YOU.

03:27.508 --> 03:29.777
YEAH, BUT I'M REALLY TRYING
TO FOCUS ON NEW BUILDS

03:29.810 --> 03:30.844
AND RENOVATIONS.

03:30.878 --> 03:32.313
BUT YOU'RE
THE SKYLIGHT KING.

03:32.346 --> 03:33.914
NOT--NOT A TITLE I CHOSE.

03:33.947 --> 03:35.949
NO, THAT IS A TITLE
YOU EARNED.

03:35.983 --> 03:37.851
I PUT IN ONE SKYLIGHT
FOR DALLAS.

03:37.885 --> 03:39.653
SKYLIGHT KING!

03:39.687 --> 03:42.456
IT'S NOT LIKE YOU'RE GONNA BE
WORKING FOR SOME TASKMASTER.

03:42.490 --> 03:45.426
YOU'RE GONNA BE WORKING
FOR ME, YOUR FRIEND.

03:45.459 --> 03:45.893
OKAY.

03:45.926 --> 03:47.361
ALL RIGHT.

03:47.395 --> 03:48.729
LET'S--LET'S BUILD YOU
A SKYLIGHT.

03:48.762 --> 03:50.331
(aristocratic voice)
WELL, THANK YOU, MY LIEGE.

03:50.364 --> 03:51.465
THANK YOU.

03:51.499 --> 03:53.567
YES. OH, YES.

03:54.835 --> 03:55.969

WHY ARE YOU THROWING AWAY

03:56.003 --> 03:57.271
THAT FOOD?

03:57.305 --> 03:58.572
YOU HAVE NOT EATEN IT YET.

03:58.606 --> 03:59.873
(automated male voice)
I HAD MY LUNCH.

03:59.907 --> 04:01.475
THIS WAS LEFTOVER.

04:01.509 --> 04:03.544
ALL LEFTOVERS GO
INTO THE TRASH.

04:03.577 --> 04:06.647
YES, HOWEVER, THERE IS STILL
PLENTY OF GOOD FOOD

04:06.680 --> 04:08.015
ON YOUR PLATE.

04:08.048 --> 04:10.818
WHO ARE YOU,
THE FASCIST FOOD POLICE?

04:10.851 --> 04:12.486
LET'S GET FIRED UP.

04:12.520 --> 04:13.287
(both) TOGETHER WE CAN FEED
THE WORLD.

04:19.059 --> 04:21.529
(amplified voice) I THINK WE ALL
GOT THE MESSAGE HERE TODAY.

04:21.562 --> 04:25.366
WE HAVE A PROBLEM
RIGHT HERE IN CHATSWIN,

04:25.399 --> 04:26.634
AND IF IT WEREN'T
FOR THE COURAGE

04:26.667 --> 04:28.436
OF A CERTAIN REDHEADED BEAR,

04:28.469 --> 04:30.471
WE WOULDN'T EVEN BE TALKING
ABOUT IT.

04:30.504 --> 04:35.876
I GIVE YOU THAT BEAR.
I GIVE YOU TESSA ALTMAN.

HEY, TRY NOT TO WASTE
SO MUCH FOOD.

04:49.590 --> 04:51.825
QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS.
QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS.

04:51.859 --> 04:53.427
QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS?

04:56.697 --> 04:57.831
AHEM.

04:57.865 --> 04:58.999
DALIA?

05:01.902 --> 05:05.439
OKAY, SO ONE TIME I WAS
ON VACATION, RIGHT?

05:05.473 --> 05:08.676
AND I WALKED OUTSIDE MY HOTEL
TO WHERE THE LOCALS LIVE,

05:08.709 --> 05:10.411
AND I SAW THINGS.

05:10.444 --> 05:11.412
SO WHAT DID YOU SEE?

05:11.445 --> 05:15.449
SUFFERING. ENDLESS SUFFERING.

05:15.483 --> 05:17.718
THEIR HAIR WAS SO FRIZZY.

05:17.751 --> 05:19.620
THEIR... HAIR?

05:19.653 --> 05:23.757
YEAH. THE HUMIDITY IN ORLANDO
IS BRUTAL,

05:23.791 --> 05:25.493
AND THEIR SKIN WAS, LIKE,
TOTALLY JACKED UP.

05:25.526 --> 05:27.127
YOU GUYS, PEOPLE ARE
DYING OVER THERE.

05:27.160 --> 05:28.028
WE NEED TO HELP THEM!

05:28.061 --> 05:28.929
WHAT CAN WE DO?

05:28.962 --> 05:29.797
THEY'RE NOT DYING!

05:29.830 --> 05:31.799
WHERE IS ORLANDO?

05:31.832 --> 05:33.601
OUR GARDENER'S NAME
IS ORLANDO.

05:33.634 --> 05:36.804
GUYS, THE PEOPLE OF FLORIDA
ARE FINE. TRUST ME.

05:36.837 --> 05:39.172
THEY HAVE THE EVERGLADES
AND ASSISTED LIVING.

05:39.206 --> 05:40.808
WE SHOULD RAISE MONEY
FOR THEM.

05:40.841 --> 05:41.642
(students murmur)

05:41.675 --> 05:43.377
NO! DOWN.

05:45.579 --> 05:48.416
WE SHOULD SEND THEM
CLARISONIC FACE BRUSHES.

05:48.449 --> 05:49.883
THEY'RE REALLY GOOD
FOR YOUR COMPLEXION, YOU GUYS.

05:49.917 --> 05:50.951
MR. WOLFE?

05:50.984 --> 05:52.653
SHE'S NOT WRONG.

05:52.686 --> 05:56.123

(Alexandra Stan's "Mr. Saxobeat"
playing)

06:28.889 --> 06:31.024

06:31.058 --> 06:32.392
HELLO?

BRING ME UP *

06:58.218 --> 07:01.822
(screaming)
AAH!

07:01.855 --> 07:02.856
* MAKE ME MOVE

07:15.869 --> 07:18.539
TESSA!
AAH!

07:18.572 --> 07:20.774
CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?
LOOK WHAT YOU STARTED?

07:20.808 --> 07:23.777
BUT IT'S RIDICULOUS! YOU REALIZE
THAT, RIGHT, MR. WOLFE?

07:23.811 --> 07:26.914
I MEAN, WE'RE HELPING PEOPLE
WITH OILY SKIN?

07:26.947 --> 07:30.017
OH, MY GOSH.
YOU ARE SO RIGHT.

07:30.050 --> 07:32.219
PEOPLE, LISTEN UP. (sighs)

07:32.252 --> 07:35.288
WE CANNOT JUST TARGET
FLORIDIANS WITH OILY SKIN.

07:35.322 --> 07:39.159
WE MUST ALSO REACH OUT TO THOSE
WITH COMBINATION AND DRY SKIN.

07:39.192 --> 07:41.762
SPREAD THE WORD.
GOOD CATCH, BOSS.

07:47.868 --> 07:50.270
(gasps) THERE SHE IS--THE GIRL
THAT'S GONNA SAVE FLORIDA.

07:50.303 --> 07:51.639
ONE FACE AT A TIME.

07:51.672 --> 07:53.073
THAT'S THE SPIRIT,
AND I SHOULD KNOW.

07:53.106 --> 07:55.876
I HAVE RUN OVER A HUNDRED
CHARITIES IN MY TIME--

07:55.909 --> 07:57.978
EVERYTHING FROM AIR BEDS
FOR THE HOMELESS...
(sighs)

07:58.011 --> 07:59.847

AIR BEDS.

08:01.682 --> 08:03.884
WELL, HAVE AT IT,
'CAUSE I'M OUT.

08:03.917 --> 08:07.087
WAIT. WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
YOU'RE OUT? YOU'RE THE LEADER.

08:07.120 --> 08:09.022
YOU'RE THE FACE
OF FLORIDA'S FACE.

08:09.056 --> 08:13.527
I MENTIONED TO MR. WOLFE
THAT MAYBE WE SHOULD DONATE

08:13.561 --> 08:15.696
UNEATEN FOOD
TO PEOPLE WHO NEED IT.

08:15.729 --> 08:17.931
DALIA IS THE ONE
WHO MADE IT ABOUT PORES.

08:17.965 --> 08:20.801
YES, BUT DALIA'S TALENTS ARE
BETTER SERVED ELSEWHERE.

08:20.834 --> 08:24.805
SHE'S MORE OF A... MUSE,
BUT YOU--YOU'RE THE WORKER BEE,

08:24.838 --> 08:26.874
GETTIN' YOUR HANDS
ALL FILTHY DIRTY,

08:26.907 --> 08:29.577
HAULIN' THINGS
WITH YOUR FILTHY, DIRTY HANDS.

08:29.610 --> 08:33.046
WE NEED YOU.
THE PEOPLE OF FLORIDA NEED YOU.

08:33.080 --> 08:35.082
NOW... I BROUGHT
THESE DELI PLATTERS

08:35.115 --> 08:37.150
FOR THE VOLUNTEERS.
HOW DO THEY LOOK?

08:37.184 --> 08:38.919
LIKE A LOT OF THIN MEAT.

08:38.952 --> 08:42.723
YOU'RE RIGHT. I DID GET THEM
PREPACKAGED AND ON SALE.

08:42.756 --> 08:44.024
MAYBE I SHOULD DUMP 'EM.

08:44.057 --> 08:45.826
YEAH, I'M GONNA DUMP 'EM.

08:47.828 --> 08:48.962
AND THAT'S WHEN I REALIZED

08:48.996 --> 08:50.964
THERE WAS NO SAVING
THESE PEOPLE.

08:50.998 --> 08:52.332
THEY WERE GONNA DO
WHAT THEY WERE GONNA DO,

08:52.365 --> 08:53.333
AND THERE WAS NO POINT
IN GETTING

08:53.366 --> 08:55.268
MY FILTHY LITTLE HANDS DIRTY...

08:55.302 --> 08:57.270
UNLESS IT WAS FOR DELI MEAT.

08:57.304 --> 08:58.672
(Muzak playing)

08:58.706 --> 08:59.940
MM... THERE SHE IS,

08:59.973 --> 09:01.809
RIGHT ALONG THE 29 PREMOLAR.
(suction gurgling)

09:01.842 --> 09:03.143
OH, AND A SLIGHT OCCLUSAL
ON 28.

09:03.176 --> 09:06.079
VERY GOOD, CINDY, AND LOOK
AT ALL THIS TARTAR BUILDUP.

09:06.113 --> 09:08.115
OH, AND SEE HOW DULL
THE SURFACES ARE?

09:08.148 --> 09:09.983
I BET HE'S A GRINDER.
WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO DO,

09:10.017 --> 09:11.785
PUT ME OUT OF A JOB THERE,
EAGLE EYE?

09:11.819 --> 09:13.754
OH, GOSH. NO, NO.
IF I COULDN'T WORK FOR YOU--

09:13.787 --> 09:15.823
(mouth full) GUYS, PLEASE.

09:15.856 --> 09:17.958
OH, SORRY, BUDDY. I'M JUST
CONSULTING WITH CINDY.

09:17.991 --> 09:19.760
WELL, YOU CRACKED IT,
ALL RIGHT.

09:19.793 --> 09:21.795
THE GOOD NEWS IS,
IT'S ABOVE THE GUMLINE.

09:21.829 --> 09:24.998
IT'S CALLED AN OBLIQUE
SUPRAGINGIVAL FRACTURE.

09:25.032 --> 09:28.602
THAT'S WHAT WIKIPEDIA CALLS IT.
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IT IS.

09:28.636 --> 09:29.970
(giggling)

09:30.003 --> 09:32.139
(laughing) BECAUSE IT'S...

09:32.172 --> 09:34.742
HE'S TEASING. HE KNOWS.

09:34.775 --> 09:36.043
I DO. I KNOW.

09:36.076 --> 09:38.211
NOAH, MAN, I'M DYING HERE.
PLEASE.

09:38.245 --> 09:40.948
I'M SORRY. I'M GONNA RECOMMEND
A CROWN, ALL RIGHT?

09:40.981 --> 09:42.082
WE CAN DIG IT OUT TODAY,

09:42.115 --> 09:43.684
DO AN IMPRESSION
SO YOU HAVE A TEMP,

09:43.717 --> 09:46.654
COME BACK LATER IN THE WEEK,
FINISH HER UP.

09:46.687 --> 09:48.188
EASY PEASY, EXTRA CHEESY.

09:48.221 --> 09:50.724
WELL, IF IT'S EXTRA CHEESY,
I GUESS WE SHOULD DO IT.

09:50.758 --> 09:53.293
ALL RIGHT. A CROWN
FOR THE SKYLIGHT KING.

09:53.326 --> 09:54.895
(imitates trumpet fanfare)

09:54.928 --> 09:56.129
(laughs)

09:56.163 --> 09:58.198
SUPER WATER FOUNTAIN
SMELLS LIKE PATCHOULI.

09:58.231 --> 10:00.033
OH, YOU SHOULD SEE
HIS WAITING ROOM.

10:00.067 --> 10:02.202
IT IS A JOKE.
HE HAS A MASSAGE TABLE.

10:02.235 --> 10:05.072
THERE'S, LIKE, ROWS OF
DIFFERENT FLAVORS OF ICED TEA.

10:05.105 --> 10:08.008
MAYBE I CAN WEAPONIZE IT,

10:08.041 --> 10:10.010
AND BAM!

10:10.043 --> 10:11.178
KILL A GUY.

10:11.211 --> 10:13.213
WHAT'S GOING ON?
YOU'RE GOING DARK ON ME.

10:13.246 --> 10:14.948
ALL THE PEOPLE I GO
TO SCHOOL WITH ARE MORONS,

10:14.982 --> 10:18.686
AND I'M GUILTY BY ASSOCIATION.
I GIVE UP.

10:18.719 --> 10:21.121
YOU'RE TOO YOUNG
TO GIVE UP.

10:21.154 --> 10:25.726
I AM THE HEAD OF THE STUPIDEST
CHARITY KNOWN TO MANKIND.

10:25.759 --> 10:28.428
(mouth full) THAT FIRST PART
SOUNDED IMPRESSIVE.

10:28.461 --> 10:29.596
YOU'RE THE HEAD.

10:29.629 --> 10:34.134
LOOK, IF PEOPLE ARE LOOKING
TO YOU AS A LEADER, THEN LEAD.

10:34.167 --> 10:35.468
YOU'VE GOT
THE ATTENTION OF MORONS?

10:35.502 --> 10:37.838
DO SOMETHING SMART WITH IT.
HOW?

10:37.871 --> 10:39.840
ALL THEY CARE ABOUT IS
HOW THEY LOOK OR WHAT THEY DRIVE

10:39.873 --> 10:41.274
OR HOW THEY LOOK
IN WHAT THEY DRIVE.

10:41.308 --> 10:44.945
YOU CAN'T BLAME THEM FOR BEING
A PRODUCT OF THEIR ENVIRONMENT.

10:44.978 --> 10:47.447
THEY KNOW WHAT THEY KNOW.
THEY LIVE IN A BUBBLE.

10:47.480 --> 10:49.750
I AM LOVING THIS DELI.

10:49.783 --> 10:52.986
GEORGE WAS RIGHT. THESE PEOPLE
WERE LIVING IN A BUBBLE,

10:53.020 --> 10:55.122
AND MAYBE IT WAS UP TO ME
TO POP IT,

10:55.155 --> 10:57.858
LIKE A PIMPLE
ON A FLORIDIAN'S BACK.

11:03.396 --> 11:04.231
(speaking indistinctly)

11:04.264 --> 11:07.868
AHEM. HEY.

11:07.901 --> 11:09.970
SO...

11:10.003 --> 11:12.706
YOU GUYS KNOW HOW YOU LIVE
IN THIS SORT OF... BUBBLE?

11:18.011 --> 11:19.479
THIS BUBBLE OF IGNORANCE?

11:19.512 --> 11:20.347
OH.

11:20.380 --> 11:22.983
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT
THAT YOU LIVE THERE.

11:23.016 --> 11:25.753
IT'S JUST... YOU HAVEN'T BEEN
EXPOSED TO MUCH.

11:25.786 --> 11:28.922
I HAVE. I USED TO LIVE
OUTSIDE THE BUBBLE,

11:28.956 --> 11:31.191
SO TODAY I'M GOING
TO EXPOSE YOU TO SOMETHING

11:31.224 --> 11:33.393
THAT I GREW UP WITH EVERY DAY.

11:33.426 --> 11:36.529
GLADYS?

11:36.563 --> 11:39.900
(wheels squeaking,
cans rattling)

11:39.933 --> 11:41.201
THIS IS GLADYS.

11:41.234 --> 11:43.136
SHE'S A HOMELESS MAN
THAT LIVED ON MY STREET.

11:43.170 --> 11:45.839
SHE'S A MAN?

11:45.873 --> 11:47.107
HOW DOES THAT WORK?

11:47.140 --> 11:48.075
(effeminate voice)
LET ME TAKE THIS ONE.

11:48.108 --> 11:49.810
(whispers) OKAY.

11:49.843 --> 11:53.113
BASICALLY YOU JUST...
TUCK EVERYTHING IN.

11:53.146 --> 11:57.084
SEE, UM, NOT EVERYBODY IS
GETTING THEIR TEETH WHITENED

11:57.117 --> 11:59.552
OR... GOING TO THE MALL

11:59.586 --> 12:01.789
OR...
OVERWATERING THEIR LAWN.

12:01.822 --> 12:04.124
SOME PEOPLE,
LIKE ME AND GLADYS,

12:04.157 --> 12:07.094
UNDERSTAND THAT
THERE ARE PEOPLE OUT THERE

12:07.127 --> 12:10.063
THAT DON'T HAVE EVERYTHING
THEY NEED.

12:10.097 --> 12:14.234
SOME PEOPLE HAVE NOTHING
AND LIVE ON THE STREET.

12:14.267 --> 12:17.070
WEST 14th, TO BE EXACT.

12:17.104 --> 12:19.006
GLADYS AND I AREN'T TRYING
TO MAKE YOU FEEL BAD.

12:19.039 --> 12:21.141
WE'RE JUST TRYING
TO SHOW YOU

12:21.174 --> 12:25.913
THAT THERE ARE REAL PROBLEMS
OUT THERE WORTH FOCUSING ON--

12:25.946 --> 12:29.249
PROBLEMS MORE SEVERE
THAN BAD SKIN OR OILY HAIR,

12:29.282 --> 12:33.086
SO, UH, THE NEXT TIME
YOU'RE ABOUT TO THROW OUT

12:33.120 --> 12:36.957
$85 WORTH OF DELI MEAT,
MAYBE YOU'LL THINK TWICE,

12:36.990 --> 12:39.192
BECAUSE THERE ARE PEOPLE
IN NEED,

12:39.226 --> 12:44.331
AND THEY'RE A LOT CLOSER
THAN FLORIDA.

12:44.364 --> 12:45.332
(whispers) THANK YOU.

12:53.941 --> 12:54.774
WHAT?

12:58.111 --> 12:59.012
WHAT?

13:05.252 --> 13:07.020
(thud)
AAH!

13:07.054 --> 13:10.123
$2,600 FOR A CROWN?!

13:10.157 --> 13:12.159
(turns off faucet)
HEY, I DON'T SET THE PRICES.

13:12.192 --> 13:13.560
IT'S YOUR PRACTICE!

13:13.593 --> 13:15.362
THAT'S TRUE.

13:15.395 --> 13:17.430
(chuckles)
BUT WHAT DID YOU EXPECT,

13:17.464 --> 13:19.199
THAT I WASN'T GONNA
CHARGE YOU AT ALL?

13:19.232 --> 13:23.070
NO, I ASSUMED YOU WERE GOING
TO GIVE ME A DISCOUNT.

13:23.103 --> 13:25.438
I MEAN, I-I GAVE--I GAVE YOU
A-A BREAK ON YOUR SKYLIGHT.

13:25.472 --> 13:28.108
WELL, I DIDN'T ASSUME THAT.
THANKS FOR THE DISCOUNT.

13:28.141 --> 13:31.144
THIS IS NOT HOW FRIENDS
TREAT EACH OTHER, NOAH.

13:31.178 --> 13:33.113
FRIENDS GIVE EACH OTHER
A DEAL.

13:33.146 --> 13:36.183
NO, FRIENDS DO THEIR
VERY BEST WORK FOR ONE ANOTHER,

13:36.216 --> 13:39.019
AND THE BEST COSTS MONEY.
LOOK, AND I'M NOT THE ONE

13:39.052 --> 13:41.488
WHO DECIDED TO STRIP NAKED
AND TAKE MY SHOWER FOR A SPIN.

13:41.521 --> 13:43.423
I HAD TO GIVE MY MAID
THE REST OF THE DAY OFF.

13:43.456 --> 13:44.958
SHE WAS SO FREAKED OUT.

13:44.992 --> 13:47.127
OH, GEE.
I'M REALLY SORRY ABOUT THAT.

13:47.160 --> 13:49.362
WHO--WHO'S GONNA CUBE
YOUR PINEAPPLE FOR YOU?

13:49.396 --> 13:51.131
UM, I'M ALLERGIC
TO PINEAPPLE.

13:51.164 --> 13:53.133
IF YOU WERE A REAL FRIEND,
YOU'D KNOW THAT,

13:53.166 --> 13:55.368
AND JUST FOR THE RECORD,
I WAS GONNA GIVE YOU A DISCOUNT,

13:55.402 --> 13:57.004
BUT I DIDN'T WANT
TO INSULT YOU,

13:57.037 --> 13:58.571
SO IF YOU WANT, GO AHEAD,
CUT IT IN HALF.

13:58.605 --> 14:00.207
MAKE IT ZERO,
FOR ALL I CARE.

14:00.240 --> 14:02.442
THAT IS VERY NOBLE OF YOU, MAN.
I REALLY APPRECIATE IT,

14:02.475 --> 14:04.377
BUT I DON'T NEED
YOUR CHARITY, OKAY, BUDDY?

14:04.411 --> 14:07.047
WAIT, BUT, LOOK, WHY WAS
I EXPECTING A "THANK YOU"?

14:07.080 --> 14:10.317
YOU KNOW WHAT? STRONG AND WRONG,
JUST LIKE ALWAYS.

14:10.350 --> 14:11.518
STRONG AND WRONG?

14:11.551 --> 14:12.986
I'M NOT--I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT THAT MEANS.

14:13.020 --> 14:14.922
(deep voice) I'M GEORGE,
AND I'M STRONG,

14:14.955 --> 14:16.356
AND BLAH, BLAH, BLAH,
BUT I'M WRONG.

14:16.389 --> 14:18.225
(laughs) YOU KNOW WHAT?

14:18.258 --> 14:21.962
GOOD LUCK WITH THAT HOLE
IN YOUR ROOF. LOOKS LIKE RAIN.

14:21.995 --> 14:24.564
GOOD LUCK SIPPING
COLD BEVERAGES!

14:24.597 --> 14:25.598
(thunder rumbles)

14:28.501 --> 14:31.504
(Lisa) S-SO WHEN GLADYS SAYS
SHE TUCKS EVERYTHING IN,

14:31.538 --> 14:34.707
WHAT EXACTLY DOES
THAT MEAN?

14:34.741 --> 14:36.343
WHAT DOES SHE TUCK?

14:36.376 --> 14:38.211
GLADYS IS A DUDE.

14:38.245 --> 14:42.015
SHE'S... A MAN.

14:42.049 --> 14:44.584
OH. (chuckles) RIGHT.
RIGHT.

14:44.617 --> 14:47.154
(school bell rings)

14:47.187 --> 14:49.389
(applause and whistles)

14:52.359 --> 14:54.962
I HAD BECOME
THEIR CAUSE DU JOUR.

14:54.995 --> 14:56.329
WHAT'S GOING ON?

14:56.363 --> 15:00.033
WE HEARD YOU, TESSA.
WE HEARD YOU LOUD AND CLEAR,

15:00.067 --> 15:01.734
AND WE'RE NOT WORRIED
ABOUT FLORIDA ANYMORE.

15:01.768 --> 15:03.670
WE'RE WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

15:03.703 --> 15:06.339
WE KNOW YOU ATE
THAT RANK MEAT.

15:06.373 --> 15:09.042
THE PICTURE YOU PAINTED
OF YOUR LIFE WITH THE HOMELESS--

15:09.076 --> 15:11.979
DEVASTATING,
BUT YOU'RE IN CHATSWIN NOW,

15:12.012 --> 15:13.713
AND CHATSWIN TAKES CARE
OF ITS OWN.

15:13.746 --> 15:16.216
COME HERE, YOU BRAVE THING.

15:16.249 --> 15:18.418
SOMEHOW I HAD SENT
TWO WRONG MESSAGES--

15:18.451 --> 15:20.287
ONE, THAT I WAS IN NEED,

15:20.320 --> 15:23.056
AND TWO, THAT IT WAS OKAY
TO TOUCH ME.

15:25.492 --> 15:28.295
THAT NIGHT, GEORGE DISCOVERED
WHAT I ALREADY KNEW--

15:28.328 --> 15:29.963
WE'D BECOME A CHARITY CASE.

15:29.997 --> 15:31.231
SO HERE'S
SOME CANNED BISQUE,

15:31.264 --> 15:33.400
SOME EGYPTIAN COTTON
HAND TOWELS,

15:33.433 --> 15:35.068
AN AIR MULTIPLIER.

15:35.102 --> 15:36.469
WE ORDERED TWO,
ONE FOR THE CABANA,

15:36.503 --> 15:38.405
BUT YOU NEED IT MORE.

15:38.438 --> 15:40.407
YEAH. YOU ATE
THAT RANK MEAT.

15:40.440 --> 15:43.243
HAVE YOU BEEN TALKING TO NOAH?
IS THAT WHAT THIS IS ABOUT?

15:43.276 --> 15:44.411
BECAUSE I'M GOING
TO TAKE CARE OF THAT BILL.

15:44.444 --> 15:47.314
OH, GEORGE. I WOULD ADD YOU
TO MY DENTAL PLAN IF I COULD,

15:47.347 --> 15:49.316
BUT I CAN'T,
SO I BROUGHT YOU

15:49.349 --> 15:51.985
A PROFESSIONAL
DOUBLE BELGIAN WAFFLE MAKER.

15:52.019 --> 15:54.554
GO ON. TAKE IT.
IT MAKES TWO AT ONCE.

15:54.587 --> 15:58.091
WE KNOW YOU NEED THIS, GEORGE.
WE ALL HEARD TESSA'S SPEECH,

15:58.125 --> 16:00.760
AND WE MET
HER TRANSSEXUAL HOMELESS FRIEND.

16:00.793 --> 16:02.529
GLADYS?
YOU--YOU BROUGHT GLADYS?

16:02.562 --> 16:05.999
I DIDN'T BRING GLADYS, NO.
SHE TOOK METRO-NORTH.

16:06.033 --> 16:10.570
AND, TESSA, DALIA HAS
SOMETHING FOR YOU. DALIA.

16:10.603 --> 16:12.405
(sighs)

16:12.439 --> 16:14.307
HERE. I STOLE THIS
FROM THE MALL.

16:14.341 --> 16:16.409
IT'S NOT MY COLOR.

16:16.443 --> 16:21.281
USED LIP GLOSS. WOW.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

16:21.314 --> 16:24.417
I DO. THANK YOU
FOR STOPPING BY OUR SHANTY.

16:24.451 --> 16:25.818
WE'LL SEE YOU AROUND
THE SOUP KITCHEN.

16:25.852 --> 16:27.754
OH. OKAY. GOD BLESS.

16:27.787 --> 16:30.290
GOD BLESS YOU.

16:30.323 --> 16:32.159
(door squeaks)

16:32.192 --> 16:34.094
DAD, I'M SO SORRY.

16:34.127 --> 16:37.464
WHEN I TOLD YOU TO FOCUS
YOUR CHARITY ON A GOOD CAUSE,

16:37.497 --> 16:39.099
DID YOU DECIDE ON US?

16:39.132 --> 16:40.367
I SWEAR THAT WASN'T
MY INTENTION.

16:40.400 --> 16:42.569
I WILL...
THROW THIS ALL OUT.

16:42.602 --> 16:44.237
THROW IT OUT? NO. WHAT?

16:44.271 --> 16:45.805
I WAS JUST ABOUT TO GO MAKE
SOME BELGIAN WAFFLES

16:45.838 --> 16:48.341
AND MULTIPLY SOME AIR.

16:48.375 --> 16:49.342
OW.

16:49.376 --> 16:51.211
(doorbell rings)

16:51.244 --> 16:52.011
WHAT?

16:52.045 --> 16:53.780
I JUST WANTED
TO--TO BRING THIS BY.

16:53.813 --> 16:56.049
IT'S A POCKET JESUS.

16:56.083 --> 16:57.517
I THOUGHT MAYBE
DURING THE HARD TIMES,

16:57.550 --> 17:00.287
IT WOULD HELP YOU SEE
THE LIGHT.

17:00.320 --> 17:01.521
IT'S ALSO A LIGHT.

17:01.554 --> 17:03.523
OH.
(click)

17:03.556 --> 17:06.626
COME IN. IT'S JUST, PEOPLE HAVE
BEEN COMING BY ALL NIGHT

17:06.659 --> 17:09.796
WITH THE MOST RIDICULOUS JUNK.

17:09.829 --> 17:11.298
I MEAN, LOOK AT THIS.

17:11.331 --> 17:14.467
A SODA MAKER.
A SNOW CONE MACHINE?

17:14.501 --> 17:17.804
WHO IN THE WORLD COULD POSSIBLY
WANT ANY OF THIS STUFF?

17:18.905 --> 17:20.607
A SNOW CONE MACHINE?

17:20.640 --> 17:23.310
I-I THOUGHT YOU HAD TO HAVE
A LICENSE TO OWN ONE OF THESE.

17:23.343 --> 17:25.412
THAT'S WHEN IT HIT ME.

17:25.445 --> 17:28.315
ONE MAN'S TRASH IS
ANOTHER MAN'S TREASURE,

17:28.348 --> 17:30.283
AND JUST 'CAUSE I DIDN'T
APPRECIATE THIS STUFF,

17:30.317 --> 17:31.518
IT DIDN'T MEAN
THERE WASN'T SOMEONE

17:31.551 --> 17:33.486
ON WEST 14th STREET WHO WOULD.

17:33.520 --> 17:34.654
"FUNTASTIC."

17:36.456 --> 17:37.590
HEY, GLADYS.

17:39.359 --> 17:40.227
YOU GOT ANOTHER ONE.

17:40.260 --> 17:41.794
OH, THANK YOU, BABY.

17:41.828 --> 17:43.163
(traffic whistle blows)

17:46.133 --> 17:49.136
OH, SNAP!
A LIGHTED BOCCIE BALL SET.

17:49.169 --> 17:50.870
THIS IS ALL KINDS
OF WONDERFUL.

17:50.903 --> 17:54.374
THANK YOU, LORD. THANK YOU!

17:54.407 --> 17:56.543
(Muzak playing)

17:56.576 --> 17:57.544
(clears throat)

17:57.577 --> 17:58.711
(door closes)

18:07.554 --> 18:09.122
I KNEW YOU WERE ALLERGIC
TO PINEAPPLE.

18:09.156 --> 18:10.089
I WAS JUST TRYING TO MAKE
A POINT.

18:10.123 --> 18:12.259
A POINT OF TRYING TO MAKE ME
FEEL LIKE AN ASS?

18:12.292 --> 18:14.461
LOOK, I'M SORRY I BLEW UP
AT YOU.

18:14.494 --> 18:17.197
I'M BUSTIN' MY BUTT OUT HERE
TRYING TO ESTABLISH MYSELF,

18:17.230 --> 18:19.632
AND THEN I GET
THIS HUGE BILL FROM YOU,

18:19.666 --> 18:22.202
AFTER YOU BRAG ABOUT
YOUR INFINITY TUB

18:22.235 --> 18:24.904
AND YOUR TALKING TOILET, WHICH I
STILL DON'T EVEN UNDERSTAND.

18:24.937 --> 18:26.439
YEAH. NO, I GET IT.
I GET IT.

18:26.473 --> 18:28.341
MAYBE I WAS SHOWING OFF
A LITTLE BIT,

18:28.375 --> 18:30.143
BUT YOU'RE A TOUGH MAN
TO COMPETE WITH, GEORGE.

18:30.177 --> 18:31.344
ARE WE IN COMPETITION?

18:31.378 --> 18:33.213
NO. (sighs)

18:33.246 --> 18:35.415
I MEAN, BACK IN COLLEGE,
YOU WERE THE GUY.

18:35.448 --> 18:37.484
YOU GOT INVITED
TO ALL THE GREAT PARTIES.

18:37.517 --> 18:38.818
YOU GOT ALL THE HOT CHICKS.

18:38.851 --> 18:40.320
ALISSA BERLINGER WAS HOT,

18:40.353 --> 18:41.554
BUT I DON'T KNOW
ABOUT THE REST OF 'EM.

18:41.588 --> 18:43.523
(scoffs)

18:43.556 --> 18:45.192
OKAY, MAYBE SOME OF THEM
WERE HOT, TOO,

18:45.225 --> 18:46.859
BUT COME ON, MAN.
YOU GOT JILL.

18:46.893 --> 18:49.829
YEAH, I GOT JILL. I DID.

18:49.862 --> 18:51.731
I...

18:51.764 --> 18:54.534
I JUST FELT LIKE
PEOPLE GAVE YOU CRAP

18:54.567 --> 18:55.868
FOR HANGING OUT WITH ME.

18:57.604 --> 18:58.571
THEY DID...

19:00.540 --> 19:02.775
BUT I'M SURE PEOPLE OUT HERE
GIVE YOU CRAP

19:02.809 --> 19:04.677
FOR HANGING OUT WITH ME.

19:04.711 --> 19:06.746
I'M LIKE
THE--THE VILLAGE IDIOT...

19:06.779 --> 19:08.481
(chuckles) OR SOMETHING.

19:08.515 --> 19:11.518
VILLAGE IDIOT? NO.

19:11.551 --> 19:15.355
IT'S JUST... YOU'RE POORER
THAN EVERYONE ELSE,

19:15.388 --> 19:18.291
AND SOME PEOPLE QUESTION
YOUR ETHNICITY.

19:18.325 --> 19:19.526
(chuckles) COME ON.

19:19.559 --> 19:21.861
LET--LET'S PUT ALL OF THIS
BEHIND US, ALL RIGHT?

19:21.894 --> 19:23.430
LET'S FIX THAT TOOTH.

19:23.463 --> 19:26.199
UH, WAIT, WAIT.

19:26.233 --> 19:28.368
SO WE'RE GOOD?

19:28.401 --> 19:30.370
WE'RE GOOD.

19:30.403 --> 19:31.438
I'M SERIOUS, NOAH.

19:31.471 --> 19:33.806
I DON'T WANT YOU TO WORK ON ME
IF YOU'RE STILL ANGRY.

19:33.840 --> 19:35.608
WHAT'S A LITTLE FEAR
BETWEEN FRIENDS?

19:35.642 --> 19:37.944
(whirring)

19:37.977 --> 19:40.413
(laughing)

19:49.622 --> 19:51.458
SMOOTHIE?
I DIDN'T PUT ICE IN IT.

19:51.491 --> 19:53.360
I KNOW YOUR MOUTH'S STILL
A LITTLE SENSITIVE.

19:53.393 --> 19:57.530
HEY. LOOK AT ME.
YOU ARE A GOOD PERSON.

19:57.564 --> 20:00.032
MNH. PFFT. DOUBTFUL.

20:00.066 --> 20:01.734
WHAT DID I ACCOMPLISH?

20:01.768 --> 20:05.438
I SENT A HOMELESS LADY MAN
COUNTERTOP APPLIANCES,

20:05.472 --> 20:06.673
AND SHE DOESN'T EVEN HAVE
A COUNTERTOP.

20:06.706 --> 20:08.708
(laughs)

20:08.741 --> 20:11.678
YEAH, BUT YOU ALSO MADE A GROUP
OF VERY SELF-OBSESSED PEOPLE

20:11.711 --> 20:13.513
CARE ABOUT SOMEONE
OTHER THAN THEMSELVES,

20:13.546 --> 20:15.482
AND THAT'S HUGE.

20:15.515 --> 20:16.583
I GUESS IT IS.

20:16.616 --> 20:20.353
YES, IT IS, AND IT WAS YOU
THEY DECIDED TO CARE ABOUT,

20:20.387 --> 20:24.424
AND I KNOW WHY--
BECAUSE YOU ARE A SWEET LADY,

20:24.457 --> 20:28.395
AND YOU HAVE A SMART HEART
ON YOUR HOLDERS.

20:30.497 --> 20:32.064
I'M ON PAIN MEDICATION.

20:32.098 --> 20:35.234
I KNOW, DAD. WHOA. I KNOW.

20:36.703 --> 20:38.538
GO TO SLEEP, OKAY?

20:38.571 --> 20:40.540
MM-HMM.

20:40.573 --> 20:42.475
(chuckles) SLEEP.

20:42.509 --> 20:43.476
(whispers) SLEEP.

20:56.623 --> 20:57.590
GLADYS?

21:04.864 --> 21:06.299
(Gladys) HEY, GIRL.

21:06.333 --> 21:08.335
JUST WANTED TO THANK YOU
FOR THE BLESSINGS.

21:08.368 --> 21:09.769
I SOLD MOST OF THAT CRAP
YOU SENT ME

21:09.802 --> 21:11.838
AND USED THE MONEY TO BUY
A POP-UP TENT,

21:11.871 --> 21:14.341
SO... (chuckles)
IF YOU EVER NEED A PLACE

21:14.374 --> 21:17.610
TO STAY IN THE CITY, GIRL...
(singsongy) CALL ME.

21:17.644 --> 21:18.845
(normal voice) I ALSO BOUGHT
A PREPAID CELL PHONE,

21:18.878 --> 21:21.648
WHICH HAS MADE TURNING TRICKS
A WHOLE LOT EASIER.

21:21.681 --> 21:25.452
GOOD LOOKING OUT, GLADYS.

21:25.485 --> 21:28.355
I CAN'T BELIEVE HE HAS
HER OWN STATIONERY.

21:28.388 --> 21:29.422
(scoffs)
