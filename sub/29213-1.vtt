01:44.062 --> 01:46.565
<i>I've been in Sta. Lucia</i>
<i>longer than I can remember.</i>

01:48.650 --> 01:50.902
<i>I heard so many stories about this place.</i>

01:53.739 --> 01:55.657
<i>I've heard so many stories</i>

01:56.199 --> 01:58.535
<i>that it's become hard to separate</i>

01:59.244 --> 02:01.038
<i>the myths from the truth.</i>

02:02.914 --> 02:06.627
<i>But I only know one story to be true.</i>

02:07.919 --> 02:09.296
<i>Every midnight</i>

02:09.671 --> 02:11.423
<i>at the end</i>
<i>of the third floor corridor,</i>

02:11.590 --> 02:14.301
<i>beside the stairwell,</i>

02:14.426 --> 02:16.428
<i>you'll find a comfort room.</i>

02:17.721 --> 02:19.598
<i>No one dares to go there anymore.</i>

02:20.724 --> 02:22.893
<i>Because if you go inside...</i>

02:23.352 --> 02:24.227
<i>there...</i>

02:24.895 --> 02:26.730
<i>when you reach the last cubicle,</i>

02:28.148 --> 02:29.900
<i>that's where she hung herself.</i>

02:32.527 --> 02:33.403
<i>Her name...</i>

02:34.863 --> 02:35.822
<i>is Erika.</i>

02:55.926 --> 02:57.386
Do you trust me?

03:00.222 --> 03:01.473
Do you know what this is?

03:08.105 --> 03:09.523
When I count to three,

03:10.565 --> 03:12.818
I want you to slam your hand here, okay?

03:15.153 --> 03:16.029
One...

03:18.990 --> 03:19.866
two...

03:22.953 --> 03:23.829
three!

03:37.426 --> 03:39.428
I ordered to turn the lights off
hours ago.

03:41.096 --> 03:43.932
You must contemplate your sins in silence.

03:44.349 --> 03:47.978
The confession will start tomorrow
at 6 o'clock sharp.

03:48.687 --> 03:49.646
Do not be late.

03:53.150 --> 03:54.025
Lie down!

03:54.735 --> 03:55.610
Close your eyes!

03:56.778 --> 03:58.655
If you cannot sleep, pray.

04:00.323 --> 04:02.576
Be ready to confess your sins tomorrow.

04:04.745 --> 04:05.829
Do you understand?

04:06.913 --> 04:07.998
Yes, Sor Alice.

04:36.443 --> 04:37.319
Jo.

04:38.028 --> 04:40.071
Hey, Jo. Come with me, I need to pee.

04:44.326 --> 04:45.202
Mich?

04:45.702 --> 04:47.329
Come with me please, I need to pee.

04:48.038 --> 04:48.914
Hey.

09:10.508 --> 09:11.384
More.

09:13.511 --> 09:14.387
Ready...

09:27.901 --> 09:28.777
Miss?

09:29.444 --> 09:30.862
Smile for the camera.

09:42.207 --> 09:43.083
Okay, girls,

09:43.500 --> 09:44.626
compress.

09:45.251 --> 09:46.127
Okay?

09:47.337 --> 09:48.213
Ready?

10:12.112 --> 10:13.446
Pat, look at this.

10:15.365 --> 10:16.241
What a waste.

10:18.493 --> 10:20.328
Why weren't you smiling?

10:25.375 --> 10:26.251
It's okay.

10:28.086 --> 10:30.130
Maybe I had too much on my mind.

10:31.673 --> 10:33.466
Especially after what happened to Anna.

10:34.884 --> 10:37.554
Is it true? Sor Alice found her?

10:38.596 --> 10:40.890
That's what I heard from Sister Luz
and Costanza.

10:42.559 --> 10:45.687
I don't understand why she won't
let me talk to the girl--

10:45.812 --> 10:47.438
Sor Alice can manage her.

10:48.523 --> 10:49.399
But--

10:49.524 --> 10:51.442
Pat, you're overthinking this.

11:17.510 --> 11:18.386
Joyce.

11:23.641 --> 11:25.351
They caught you on the rooftop again?

11:31.024 --> 11:31.900
Hand it over.

11:38.323 --> 11:39.199
It's already empty.

11:46.706 --> 11:48.041
What's this for anyway?

11:51.252 --> 11:52.212
To keep me awake.

11:52.921 --> 11:55.506
Isn't it better if you rest?

11:55.882 --> 11:57.300
Are you even getting any sleep?

11:59.260 --> 12:00.803
I should have gone with Anna.

12:04.682 --> 12:06.809
She could still be at Sta. Lucia if I did.

12:06.893 --> 12:07.769
Joyce,

12:08.436 --> 12:10.438
what happened to Anna is not your fault.

12:11.856 --> 12:13.149
What do you think happened?

12:14.108 --> 12:15.318
Did she see something?

12:19.697 --> 12:22.200
No one's talking about it,
no one's telling us anything.

12:26.955 --> 12:28.790
Only Anna can tell what really happened.

12:29.666 --> 12:31.918
I didn't know you could leave
just like that.

12:35.088 --> 12:36.547
I wish I left a long time ago.

12:40.551 --> 12:41.427
Why?

12:43.680 --> 12:45.390
It's the same every day.

12:48.434 --> 12:51.062
That's why I stay on the rooftop,
so I can clear my mind.

12:53.606 --> 12:56.150
It's as if everything's useless,
like nothing matters.

13:00.655 --> 13:01.531
Joyce...

13:03.324 --> 13:05.243
are you hurting yourself again?

13:14.127 --> 13:15.586
Sor Alice will kill me.

13:15.753 --> 13:17.297
-Joyce?
-I'm late again.

13:19.048 --> 13:21.884
You can always come here
if you need someone to talk to, okay?

13:32.895 --> 13:34.689
This is for you, Miss Pat.

13:41.863 --> 13:43.614
Why are you sad here again?

13:45.867 --> 13:46.743
That's not me.

14:59.023 --> 15:03.861
<i>The Supreme Court has put Ramon Pascual</i>
<i>on death row.</i>

15:04.695 --> 15:07.115
<i>Pascual was caught in the act</i>

15:07.490 --> 15:10.785
<i>decapitating the head of his mother.</i>

15:11.786 --> 15:16.290
<i>Pascual is among the growing number</i>
<i>of criminals convicted with death sentence</i>

15:16.374 --> 15:20.211
<i>since it was imposed in 1993.</i>

15:34.350 --> 15:35.226
Mr. Fidel.

15:35.351 --> 15:37.562
-Good evening, Miss Consolacion.
-Good evening.

15:38.229 --> 15:39.480
Working this late again?

15:40.648 --> 15:41.858
As always.

15:42.608 --> 15:44.694
You know I don't have anyone
to go home to.

15:46.487 --> 15:49.699
Maybe you should start looking for...

15:50.783 --> 15:52.827
someone to go home to.

15:52.910 --> 15:54.787
So you don't have to work all the time.

15:55.413 --> 15:56.914
Okay. Take care of yourself.

16:00.751 --> 16:01.627
You too.

17:42.228 --> 17:43.688
Good evening, Eri.

17:46.232 --> 17:47.358
How have you been?

17:51.153 --> 17:53.823
I read the last book in the library.

17:57.118 --> 17:58.536
I've read everything.

18:03.249 --> 18:05.126
Let's get out of here, Miss Pat.

18:07.211 --> 18:08.504
Where will we go?

18:10.339 --> 18:11.215
Anywhere.

18:14.427 --> 18:16.637
If only I could leave this place.

18:19.390 --> 18:20.891
Why can’t you?

18:23.686 --> 18:25.771
Is that what happens to people...

18:29.358 --> 18:30.359
like you?

18:32.987 --> 18:33.863
Maybe.

18:36.907 --> 18:38.367
Do you want me to come with you?

18:49.462 --> 18:50.338
Eri...

18:54.800 --> 18:56.385
what happened to Anna?

18:58.054 --> 18:59.597
Did she see you?

19:01.641 --> 19:02.808
I didn't mean to.

19:03.809 --> 19:04.685
I'm sorry.

19:06.395 --> 19:08.314
They're all afraid of me.

19:10.441 --> 19:11.567
Why aren't you?

19:15.112 --> 19:16.989
Should I be afraid?

19:20.159 --> 19:21.202
My father...

19:23.329 --> 19:24.622
he wasn't afraid either.

19:26.916 --> 19:28.417
I still see him sometimes.

19:33.673 --> 19:34.799
There, in the corner...

19:40.805 --> 19:42.056
staring at me.

19:44.100 --> 19:45.101
At us.

19:46.268 --> 19:47.144
Where?

22:00.569 --> 22:01.445
Eri?

22:11.872 --> 22:12.748
Eri...

23:04.800 --> 23:06.343
<i>Where are we going?</i>

23:10.890 --> 23:12.641
<i>Why can't you leave?</i>

23:16.020 --> 23:18.022
<i>Is that what happens to people...</i>

24:02.107 --> 24:06.028
<i>That was the sixth session with Eri,</i>
<i>but she still won’t tell me her story.</i>

24:06.654 --> 24:08.489
<i>She needs someone to talk to,</i>

24:08.572 --> 24:11.325
<i>but she won’t tell me</i>
<i>what really happened to her.</i>

24:12.409 --> 24:13.911
<i>Why did she kill herself?</i>

24:14.453 --> 24:17.748
<i>If I knew the answer,</i>
<i>I'd know my students better.</i>

24:18.332 --> 24:19.959
<i>I can keep them safe.</i>

26:01.810 --> 26:04.480
We forced her to stay late at night
just to punish her.

26:05.898 --> 26:08.859
After what happened to Anna,
we should've known better.

26:11.236 --> 26:12.988
We all know Mr. Fidel.

26:14.073 --> 26:16.742
He spent his whole life serving
at Sta. Lucia.

26:17.576 --> 26:20.079
Do you really believe
he could do something like this?

26:32.424 --> 26:33.717
I'll talk to the children.

26:34.593 --> 26:35.844
Maybe they know something.

27:05.541 --> 27:08.001
Sor Alice, isn't that too soon?

27:08.585 --> 27:09.795
A lot of parents called--

27:09.920 --> 27:11.964
It's out of our hands
if they want to leave.

27:12.047 --> 27:14.007
There are still those who chose to stay.

27:14.091 --> 27:15.717
That's all that matters.

28:29.416 --> 28:30.792
Miss. Consolacion,

28:31.543 --> 28:32.711
may I speak with you?

28:35.964 --> 28:36.840
Just a moment.

28:39.801 --> 28:40.844
Hand it over.

28:41.887 --> 28:43.513
You'll get into trouble again.

28:46.099 --> 28:47.684
The matches too.

28:49.603 --> 28:51.480
The session isn't over yet, all right?

29:00.405 --> 29:01.281
Come in.

29:02.824 --> 29:06.036
I'm Julian. I've been assigned
to investigate this case.

29:15.754 --> 29:16.922
How can I help you?

29:18.048 --> 29:19.883
You know Fidel, right?

29:22.511 --> 29:25.305
He was working here,
even before I was hired.

29:27.349 --> 29:28.642
Which got me thinking...

29:30.352 --> 29:32.312
if he's capable of doing this,
why only now?

29:34.731 --> 29:36.692
I've been asking myself the same question.

29:38.026 --> 29:40.696
Is it true
you're taking him to Muntinlupa?

29:42.030 --> 29:42.906
Yes.

29:44.366 --> 29:45.242
Death row?

29:47.327 --> 29:48.787
I can't say just yet.

29:58.297 --> 30:01.216
-You also own one of these?
-Maybe there were other people

30:01.300 --> 30:04.303
at the crime scene
the night Clara was murdered.

30:06.847 --> 30:09.224
I'll ask around,
my students might know something.

30:09.308 --> 30:10.726
They trust me.

30:11.768 --> 30:12.644
Good.

30:13.603 --> 30:15.731
Use that. When you get information

30:15.814 --> 30:17.899
useful to the investigation...

30:19.192 --> 30:20.068
call me.

30:29.453 --> 30:30.495
Here's my number.

30:32.497 --> 30:33.373
Thank you.

30:35.500 --> 30:39.046
Most of the conversations
I have with my students are confidential.

30:39.796 --> 30:41.590
Their secret is my secret.

30:43.467 --> 30:47.262
I'll call you when something comes up.

30:47.721 --> 30:49.848
Ms. Consolacion, I'm here to help.

30:51.350 --> 30:53.185
We won't tell this to the chief yet.

30:53.977 --> 30:56.229
The chief is already convinced
that Fidel did it.

30:58.857 --> 30:59.733
Thank you.

31:00.609 --> 31:01.777
Thank you for your time.

31:25.467 --> 31:26.343
Clara?

33:13.825 --> 33:14.743
What do you think?

33:15.869 --> 33:18.038
How old are these butterflies?

33:20.499 --> 33:22.876
Butterflies only live for a few months.

33:25.253 --> 33:26.963
They don't look dead to me.

33:30.467 --> 33:32.719
They look like they could still fly.

33:36.306 --> 33:37.349
They're not moving...

33:39.351 --> 33:40.685
because they are imprisoned.

33:43.605 --> 33:44.481
I know...

33:46.149 --> 33:47.651
you want to talk to her.

33:49.819 --> 33:51.446
Do you know where she is right now?

33:53.740 --> 33:54.908
Why would I tell you?

33:57.244 --> 33:59.663
You know, you can always talk to me,

34:00.664 --> 34:01.540
right?

34:08.421 --> 34:11.174
You know, Ms. Pat, you have a nice voice.

34:12.968 --> 34:14.678
Not like my mother's.

34:17.472 --> 34:19.182
It's been decades now...

34:20.600 --> 34:22.686
<i>I still can't forget my mother's voice...</i>

34:26.314 --> 34:27.524
<i>It echoes around me,</i>

34:28.191 --> 34:29.776
<i>still ringing in my ears.</i>

34:31.278 --> 34:33.780
It was like how the nuns
at school shouted at me.

34:34.823 --> 34:37.867
<i>It surrounds you, suffocates you...</i>

34:39.452 --> 34:41.413
<i>until you're totally helpless.</i>

34:42.122 --> 34:43.582
<i>Until all you can do is submit.</i>

34:46.459 --> 34:48.837
<i>I can still hear the nuns screaming.</i>

34:50.672 --> 34:51.923
Even now that I'm...

34:52.966 --> 34:53.842
dead.

35:01.725 --> 35:02.851
Someone's coming.

35:12.944 --> 35:13.820
Who, Eri?

36:12.629 --> 36:16.675
<i>There will be a new set of rules</i>
<i>here at Sta. Lucia.</i>

36:17.801 --> 36:20.637
<i>Students are not allowed to walk around,</i>
<i>unless in pairs.</i>

36:21.346 --> 36:24.099
<i>Students will be assigned to a partner</i>

36:24.808 --> 36:27.602
<i>for every trip to the hallway</i>
<i>or the washroom,</i>

36:28.269 --> 36:29.521
<i>and during recess.</i>

36:31.731 --> 36:34.609
<i>Everyone must sign attendance</i>
<i>for every class.</i>

36:35.694 --> 36:37.112
<i>And most importantly,</i>

36:37.445 --> 36:43.451
<i>all faculty and students</i>
<i>must be off the campus by 6 p.m. sharp.</i>

36:44.452 --> 36:47.038
<i>Those who do not abide</i>
<i>will be suspended...</i>

37:07.308 --> 37:08.727
<i>Do you still remember...</i>

37:09.811 --> 37:12.021
<i>the time when I had the chance</i>
<i>to defend Ces</i>

37:12.105 --> 37:13.857
<i>when she was bullied by Mary?</i>

37:14.649 --> 37:18.653
<i>-But I did nothing.</i>
<i>-Clara don't blame yourself.</i>

37:19.738 --> 37:23.825
<i>What if you ever see me in need of help,</i>
<i>will you come to my rescue?</i>

37:25.285 --> 37:28.455
<i>But you're a grownup,</i>
<i>you can take care of yourself.</i>

37:29.622 --> 37:32.167
<i>Even grownups need saving sometimes.</i>

37:33.960 --> 37:35.086
<i>Okay, Miss Pat.</i>

37:35.462 --> 37:39.090
<i>When the time comes that you need help,</i>
<i>I promise to be there for you.</i>

37:39.674 --> 37:42.260
<i>And I promise to be there for you too.</i>

40:49.864 --> 40:50.907
Sor Alice?

41:46.963 --> 41:49.590
-Hello, Julian? It's me, Pat.
<i>-Hello?</i>

41:50.633 --> 41:52.844
Is there any way I can talk to Fidel?

41:53.761 --> 41:56.097
<i>Pat, Fidel's case is high profile.</i>

41:56.180 --> 41:58.307
<i>Not anyone can talk to him.</i>

41:59.809 --> 42:01.269
<i>I just want to hear him out.</i>

42:02.395 --> 42:04.230
<i>How about you? How have you been?</i>

42:05.356 --> 42:06.983
<i>The suspect accused of strangling...</i>

42:07.066 --> 42:08.568
I haven't gotten anything yet.

42:08.818 --> 42:11.112
It's as if they want to forget
the whole thing,

42:11.654 --> 42:14.574
-just to save the school's image.
<i>-...in the murder</i>

42:14.657 --> 42:16.743
<i>of fourteen-year-old student,</i>
<i>Clara Nemenzo...</i>

42:16.951 --> 42:17.827
Sorry, Julian.

42:18.244 --> 42:22.749
<i>...whose body was found at 6 o'clock</i>
<i>in the morning by a nun in Sta. Lucia...</i>

42:22.832 --> 42:24.375
<i>Pat? Hello?</i>

42:25.251 --> 42:26.544
I'll call you back.

42:26.627 --> 42:28.421
<i>We will do everything in our power</i>

42:28.504 --> 42:30.798
<i>to make sure</i>
<i>the bastard gets the death penalty.</i>

42:30.923 --> 42:33.968
<i>I hope the president hears this.</i>
<i>I hope he helps us.</i>

42:34.302 --> 42:38.723
<i>We deserve justice, even if that means</i>
<i>death for that son of a bitch.</i>

42:39.682 --> 42:42.351
<i>Fidel Cariaso, the caretaker</i>
<i>of Sta. Lucia Academy,</i>

42:42.477 --> 42:45.271
<i>is now being charged with homicide.</i>

45:46.035 --> 45:46.953
Clara?

47:00.568 --> 47:01.444
Clara?

47:04.322 --> 47:05.573
Did I startle you?

47:08.200 --> 47:09.243
Don't--

47:09.910 --> 47:11.162
Don't look at me.

47:20.129 --> 47:21.005
Clara?

47:24.592 --> 47:25.593
Clara...

47:28.763 --> 47:29.764
Don't worry.

47:38.189 --> 47:39.899
I didn't mean to.

47:44.904 --> 47:46.530
Clara, who killed you?

48:13.099 --> 48:14.141
Someone's coming.

48:39.917 --> 48:41.293
Miss Consolacion!

48:50.302 --> 48:51.262
Sor Alice...

48:53.472 --> 48:54.765
what are you doing here?

48:56.976 --> 48:59.103
Shouldn't I be the one asking you that?

49:00.896 --> 49:02.815
There's a new rule now.

49:04.525 --> 49:07.736
No one should be here after 6 p.m.

49:11.198 --> 49:12.199
What about you?

49:13.325 --> 49:15.911
I'm just making sure
no one is loitering around here.

49:16.579 --> 49:19.832
Fidel is no longer here, and the school
isn't going to look after itself.

49:21.333 --> 49:23.919
What happened to Clara that night
you were punishing her?

49:24.587 --> 49:26.464
What are you trying to say, Patricia?

49:27.006 --> 49:31.469
Someone died that night,
and we both know Fidel didn't kill her.

49:36.265 --> 49:37.892
If you're going to make trouble...

49:38.517 --> 49:40.811
while others are still mourning...

49:41.479 --> 49:42.646
don’t bother coming here.

49:44.899 --> 49:46.734
Isn't now the time you need me the most?

49:47.526 --> 49:49.820
When the children don't know what to do?

49:50.237 --> 49:52.740
They will know what to do if they listen.

49:52.948 --> 49:54.992
I just want to know what happened.

49:55.659 --> 49:58.037
I'll give you one last chance.

49:58.829 --> 50:00.664
Think about what you're doing.

50:01.916 --> 50:04.668
If I see you again around here
at this hour...

50:05.836 --> 50:09.131
I will be forced to suspended you,
Patricia.

50:10.966 --> 50:11.967
Do you understand?

50:13.928 --> 50:15.596
This isn't your purpose here.

50:19.850 --> 50:21.519
I advise you to pray, Patricia.

50:23.187 --> 50:25.105
So that your conscience will be cleared.

52:08.542 --> 52:09.418
Joyce?

52:10.544 --> 52:11.420
Joyce!

52:12.838 --> 52:13.714
Joyce...

52:20.262 --> 52:22.181
Help us!

52:47.164 --> 52:48.082
Ms. Pat?

52:50.668 --> 52:52.086
What are you thinking about?

52:57.716 --> 52:58.717
Maybe...

53:04.890 --> 53:06.225
my brother.

53:09.019 --> 53:10.062
You have a brother?

53:11.855 --> 53:12.898
My older brother.

53:14.233 --> 53:15.776
Why didn't you mention him before?

53:19.863 --> 53:21.156
He's not here anymore.

53:22.074 --> 53:23.158
He died a long time ago.

53:26.870 --> 53:28.247
What happened to him?

53:44.388 --> 53:46.849
Mom and Dad weren't around that night.

53:50.227 --> 53:52.980
<i>My brother and I were the only ones</i>
<i>in the house.</i>

53:57.818 --> 53:58.736
<i>And then...</i>

54:00.988 --> 54:03.198
I went to his room.

54:04.825 --> 54:05.784
Then...

54:10.622 --> 54:12.875
<i>I can still remember the smell</i>
<i>of his room.</i>

54:16.378 --> 54:18.088
I opened the door...

54:22.926 --> 54:26.180
The signs had always been there...

54:28.056 --> 54:29.391
<i>but no one listened.</i>

54:37.316 --> 54:38.358
Joyce.

54:41.487 --> 54:44.198
I couldn't save my brother, Anna...

54:45.657 --> 54:46.617
or Clara.

54:49.286 --> 54:50.287
But you...

54:54.458 --> 54:56.710
Promise me you'll fight through this.

55:07.805 --> 55:08.847
<i>How is she?</i>

55:10.307 --> 55:13.227
She can talk now, but she still...

55:13.769 --> 55:15.437
she still needs to rest for now.

55:17.064 --> 55:18.398
Why did you come here?

55:21.777 --> 55:23.153
They already closed the case.

55:24.530 --> 55:26.406
Pat, Fidel killed Clara.

55:28.867 --> 55:30.410
There's nothing we can do for him.

55:32.579 --> 55:33.455
Pat.

55:34.373 --> 55:35.499
Pat, wait.

57:00.125 --> 57:01.043
Girls, stop.

57:04.046 --> 57:05.088
Girls, stop.

57:07.299 --> 57:08.342
Girls!

58:10.612 --> 58:11.488
Don't!

58:44.229 --> 58:46.356
Sta. Lucia has been here for decades.

58:48.150 --> 58:49.651
We've been this way ever since.

58:50.819 --> 58:53.238
Nothing has changed.

58:57.159 --> 58:59.161
For the longest time I've been here,

58:59.995 --> 59:00.996
and not once...

59:01.997 --> 59:04.666
did anyone question our methods.

59:07.419 --> 59:10.505
It isn't right to treat them that way.

59:21.475 --> 59:24.603
All you talk about is discipline,
when the children are dying.

59:33.987 --> 59:35.947
If only you were doing your job,

59:36.448 --> 59:38.867
Joyce wouldn't have attempted suicide.

59:52.005 --> 59:55.342
-Pat, Sor Alice is only human--
-She's blaming me for Joyce's attempt.

59:59.721 --> 1:00:02.015
I shouldn't say this, but...

1:00:04.518 --> 1:00:06.228
she's been through this before.

1:00:08.480 --> 1:00:10.816
What happened to her student
was even worse.

1:00:18.448 --> 1:00:19.533
What happened?

1:00:23.161 --> 1:00:25.997
It was a long time ago.
I've only heard rumors about it.

1:00:27.749 --> 1:00:29.584
They said the child hung herself...

1:00:31.920 --> 1:00:33.630
somewhere inside Sta. Lucia.

1:00:35.799 --> 1:00:37.050
What was her name?

1:00:39.511 --> 1:00:41.012
I can't remember.

1:00:41.221 --> 1:00:44.474
It happened years ago,
long before I was in Sta. Lucia.

1:00:51.022 --> 1:00:52.190
I need your help.

1:00:54.484 --> 1:00:57.571
-Why?
-I need access to Sor Alice's files.

1:00:57.863 --> 1:01:00.532
I need to know the name of the child
who hung herself.

1:01:00.615 --> 1:01:03.493
I have a feeling that this is related
to what happened to Clara.

1:01:03.910 --> 1:01:05.078
I can't, Pat.

1:01:06.413 --> 1:01:09.958
Even if I wanted to help,
I might get suspended.

1:01:21.428 --> 1:01:22.512
I'll do it myself.

1:01:25.056 --> 1:01:25.932
Pat!

1:01:26.600 --> 1:01:28.101
I'm already suspended.

1:01:28.310 --> 1:01:29.811
What more can they do to me?

1:01:32.564 --> 1:01:33.440
Wait.

1:08:01.202 --> 1:08:02.495
You know Erika Sayco?

1:08:11.754 --> 1:08:13.256
What happened to Erika?

1:08:17.135 --> 1:08:18.011
To Clara?

1:08:25.727 --> 1:08:27.645
I was a guidance counselor before.

1:08:29.856 --> 1:08:32.942
During that time, only nuns
were permitted to work in Sta. Lucia.

1:08:35.653 --> 1:08:39.657
How do you even help someone
who doesn't want to be helped?

1:08:41.576 --> 1:08:43.369
Erika Sayco was like that.

1:08:46.539 --> 1:08:51.002
The way of God was the only way
I knew to help her.

1:08:52.712 --> 1:08:55.256
But God wasn't enough for her.

1:08:58.009 --> 1:08:59.260
So, you gave up?

1:09:06.184 --> 1:09:08.061
Now I'm starting to realize...

1:09:12.649 --> 1:09:15.943
that God doesn't have all the answers.

1:09:21.115 --> 1:09:22.867
I'm sorry.

1:09:24.118 --> 1:09:26.454
Then why do you keep interfering?

1:09:26.996 --> 1:09:29.624
Why can't I help them
in the way I know how?

1:09:30.083 --> 1:09:32.502
Tell Erika to forgive me.

1:09:36.464 --> 1:09:39.676
Tell her to ask for God's forgiveness
for what she's done.

1:09:41.135 --> 1:09:42.470
"What she's done?"

1:09:48.184 --> 1:09:51.354
Fidel wasn't the only one there
the night Clara died.

1:09:53.773 --> 1:09:56.943
<i>There's a reason why spirits</i>
<i>remain on this earth.</i>

1:09:57.402 --> 1:09:59.862
<i>But I never dared to find out why.</i>

1:10:00.029 --> 1:10:02.824
<i>This is what they have taught us.</i>

1:10:03.533 --> 1:10:06.786
<i>I tried so hard to hide this truth...</i>

1:10:07.912 --> 1:10:11.582
away from Sta. Lucia, away from Clara,

1:10:13.835 --> 1:10:15.628
and from you, Patricia.

1:10:18.715 --> 1:10:24.220
<i>There are things far too evil</i>
<i>for us to ever understand.</i>

1:10:34.731 --> 1:10:37.275
Some souls are so filled with hate

1:10:37.984 --> 1:10:40.153
that they wish nothing but harm
for the living.

1:10:40.278 --> 1:10:44.991
At that point I don't know what to do,
there’s nothing I can do!

1:10:50.371 --> 1:10:51.622
I'm not like you.

1:10:54.751 --> 1:10:57.503
I won't give up on her.

1:11:25.198 --> 1:11:26.073
Pat!

1:11:26.824 --> 1:11:27.700
Pat!

1:11:28.367 --> 1:11:31.287
-Pat!
-Sorry to bother you.

1:11:31.454 --> 1:11:33.080
-Not at all.
-Come inside.

1:11:34.499 --> 1:11:36.209
I found what you asked for.

1:11:36.834 --> 1:11:37.919
You need to see this.

1:11:39.045 --> 1:11:41.547
-What did you find?
-With Erika, nothing.

1:11:41.881 --> 1:11:44.175
She hung herself in the comfort room
of Sta. Lucia.

1:11:44.300 --> 1:11:45.802
That's the only evidence I found.

1:11:45.885 --> 1:11:50.097
It was ruled out as suicide,
but I checked her father's files,

1:11:50.431 --> 1:11:51.557
Ernesto Sayco.

1:11:52.767 --> 1:11:53.768
Eri's father?

1:11:54.435 --> 1:11:57.897
Two years after Eri's death,
he killed his wife.

1:11:58.314 --> 1:12:02.109
Inside the car, outside of Sta. Lucia,
he strangled her.

1:12:03.402 --> 1:12:06.072
-That's what she told me.
-Who?

1:12:09.075 --> 1:12:11.619
A student of mine,
she told me about this rumor.

1:12:12.829 --> 1:12:14.956
Ernesto was sent to the electric chair.

1:12:15.206 --> 1:12:18.918
They said he went insane
after his daughter's death.

1:12:19.001 --> 1:12:20.670
But there was no clear motive.

1:12:22.296 --> 1:12:23.923
I got his confession.

1:12:24.841 --> 1:12:25.716
Listen.

1:12:31.055 --> 1:12:32.598
<i>Yes, I killed my wife.</i>

1:12:33.140 --> 1:12:34.559
<i>Why did you kill her?</i>

1:12:35.351 --> 1:12:38.187
<i>I don't know.</i>
<i>I had no control over myself.</i>

1:12:38.813 --> 1:12:41.274
<i>We've argued many times,</i>
<i>but not like this.</i>

1:12:41.941 --> 1:12:43.568
<i>I was filled with rage.</i>

1:12:44.360 --> 1:12:47.029
<i>A rage I've never felt before--</i>

1:12:47.613 --> 1:12:49.240
You have your tape recorder, right?

1:12:58.332 --> 1:13:00.293
This is Fidel's confession.

1:13:01.586 --> 1:13:07.842
<i>-God help me, I didn't mean to.</i>
<i>-Not me, I couldn't do this.</i>

1:13:08.259 --> 1:13:11.721
<i>-Help me, I'm not a murderer.</i>
<i>-It's not my fault, I couldn't control it.</i>

1:13:11.888 --> 1:13:16.350
<i>-I wrapped my hands around her neck...</i>
<i>-I wrapped my hands around her neck...</i>

1:13:16.976 --> 1:13:19.729
<i>-I choked the life out of her.</i>
<i>-I choked the life out of her.</i>

1:13:20.646 --> 1:13:23.274
<i>-I don't know why I did it.</i>
<i>-I couldn't control myself.</i>

1:13:23.482 --> 1:13:26.485
<i>-I had no control.</i>
<i>-I don't know why.</i>

1:13:26.652 --> 1:13:31.949
<i>-Please sir, don't throw me in jail.</i>
<i>-I don't know what came over me.</i>

1:13:32.199 --> 1:13:33.576
<i>I have a family!</i>

1:13:34.827 --> 1:13:36.203
I need to go.

1:13:36.412 --> 1:13:38.748
Wait, where are you going?

1:13:41.000 --> 1:13:44.545
-I need to go to Sta. Lucia.
-Wait, I'll come with you.

1:13:46.881 --> 1:13:49.425
Why would he do it?
Why would he kill all of a sudden?

1:13:49.717 --> 1:13:52.178
If he really did it, why?
Where is the motive?

1:13:52.261 --> 1:13:54.513
-What will he get from killing her?
-Wait.

1:13:54.639 --> 1:13:56.807
Pat, I don't understand
what you're saying.

1:13:58.559 --> 1:13:59.936
There's something wrong here.

1:14:00.019 --> 1:14:01.687
-What's wrong?
-Everything!

1:14:06.067 --> 1:14:09.153
-I can handle myself.
-Wait, where are you going?

1:14:09.779 --> 1:14:11.197
-Pat!
-Thank you!

1:14:50.945 --> 1:14:51.821
Eri?

1:16:00.389 --> 1:16:01.265
Eri?

1:16:07.646 --> 1:16:08.981
Why are you crying?

1:16:11.275 --> 1:16:12.485
It hurts.

1:16:14.570 --> 1:16:15.821
It hurts so much.

1:16:21.494 --> 1:16:22.620
Let's do it this way.

1:16:26.707 --> 1:16:27.958
I'll go in.

1:16:29.919 --> 1:16:31.003
You won't see me.

1:16:32.379 --> 1:16:33.631
I won't see you.

1:16:35.049 --> 1:16:36.592
But we'll talk.

1:17:04.370 --> 1:17:07.832
Ms. Pat, why do you keep coming back here?

1:17:10.793 --> 1:17:13.671
I want to find out the motive
of the people who did this to you.

1:17:16.006 --> 1:17:20.427
If I can do that, I would learn
how to talk to someone like you.

1:17:21.762 --> 1:17:23.013
People like me?

1:17:24.932 --> 1:17:26.350
People who were wronged.

1:17:27.226 --> 1:17:28.394
You'll stay with me?

1:17:30.855 --> 1:17:31.939
Yes, I'll stay with you.

1:17:32.189 --> 1:17:33.065
Always?

1:17:34.275 --> 1:17:35.192
Always.

1:17:41.031 --> 1:17:42.283
You'll follow me...

1:17:45.161 --> 1:17:46.287
to Hell?

1:17:49.748 --> 1:17:52.251
-What?
-Will you see your brother there?

1:17:53.294 --> 1:17:55.087
Isn't it a sin to kill yourself?

1:17:56.338 --> 1:17:58.048
That's what they taught us before.

1:17:58.591 --> 1:18:00.551
Even Sor Alice said it.

1:18:02.469 --> 1:18:03.929
People like me,

1:18:04.597 --> 1:18:06.140
should have never been born.

1:18:06.974 --> 1:18:08.350
Eri, that's not true.

1:18:08.684 --> 1:18:10.436
That's what everyone told me.

1:18:15.482 --> 1:18:16.901
<i>I have no friends.</i>

1:18:19.695 --> 1:18:21.989
<i>No one wanted to be friends with me.</i>

1:18:26.619 --> 1:18:27.494
<i>Even her.</i>

1:18:29.038 --> 1:18:30.039
<i>Especially her.</i>

1:19:10.120 --> 1:19:11.455
<i>No one understood me.</i>

1:19:14.083 --> 1:19:15.417
<i>They wouldn't listen.</i>

1:19:24.468 --> 1:19:25.928
<i>Even at home...</i>

1:19:28.514 --> 1:19:32.351
<i>my mother cut my hair so short...</i>

1:19:34.311 --> 1:19:37.064
<i>So... ugly.</i>

1:19:57.960 --> 1:19:59.253
<i>They laughed at me.</i>

1:20:03.173 --> 1:20:04.216
<i>All of them.</i>

1:20:07.928 --> 1:20:08.971
<i>I wanted to die.</i>

1:20:15.185 --> 1:20:17.563
<i>They say, God is always right.</i>

1:20:17.855 --> 1:20:19.315
<i>No one else, only Him.</i>

1:20:23.944 --> 1:20:25.362
<i>All must submit to Him.</i>

1:20:26.447 --> 1:20:29.742
<i>His happiness should come first,</i>
<i>even if we're suffering.</i>

1:20:31.535 --> 1:20:35.748
<i>I tried to leave,</i>
<i>but they didn't allow me.</i>

1:20:37.374 --> 1:20:40.753
<i>We must all suffer</i>
<i>for our most beloved God.</i>

1:20:45.299 --> 1:20:48.302
But I noticed
I was the only one suffering.

1:20:52.139 --> 1:20:54.850
<i>So, I promised myself that one day...</i>

1:20:56.435 --> 1:20:58.687
<i>I won't be alone in my suffering.</i>

1:21:04.443 --> 1:21:07.905
<i>For God, we must come together.</i>

1:21:10.491 --> 1:21:14.036
<i>My parents went to Sta. Lucia</i>
<i>to collect the things I'd left.</i>

1:21:15.621 --> 1:21:18.207
<i>There, I discovered I could do things</i>

1:21:18.374 --> 1:21:20.376
that I couldn't do
while I was still alive.

1:21:21.752 --> 1:21:24.463
<i>My mother, she was easy to kill.</i>

1:21:25.005 --> 1:21:25.964
<i>She was weak.</i>

1:21:28.342 --> 1:21:29.468
<i>But my father...</i>

1:21:30.928 --> 1:21:32.304
<i>he was even weaker.</i>

1:21:38.519 --> 1:21:39.770
What did you do?

1:21:41.271 --> 1:21:42.398
You still don't know?

1:21:43.732 --> 1:21:46.944
I used Fidel to kill Clara...

1:21:48.612 --> 1:21:50.280
so I could have a friend.

1:21:52.658 --> 1:21:56.412
But when she was here,
she didn't want to be friends with me.

1:21:57.329 --> 1:21:59.331
She's like the other girls before.

1:22:02.292 --> 1:22:05.087
Eri, what they did to you was wrong.

1:22:07.339 --> 1:22:08.465
But this...

1:22:09.925 --> 1:22:11.427
Killing people?

1:22:11.552 --> 1:22:13.429
They killed me. They killed me every day.

1:22:15.264 --> 1:22:16.640
Now you know...

1:22:18.016 --> 1:22:19.518
do you still want to be with me?

1:22:23.897 --> 1:22:24.773
What?

1:22:25.482 --> 1:22:27.484
I was okay being alone. I was contented.

1:22:29.736 --> 1:22:32.698
But one day, you came along.

1:22:33.407 --> 1:22:34.616
You befriended me.

1:22:35.117 --> 1:22:39.496
You told me to get out
and be friends with others.

1:22:40.289 --> 1:22:42.207
But do you know what I found out?

1:22:43.000 --> 1:22:44.877
No one will ever understand me.

1:22:45.586 --> 1:22:47.004
Not people like you!

1:22:48.005 --> 1:22:49.590
I can't live again,

1:22:49.798 --> 1:22:52.509
but you people can be like me...

1:22:55.929 --> 1:22:56.847
Dead.

1:22:58.348 --> 1:22:59.475
First, Clara...

1:23:00.184 --> 1:23:01.185
now, you!

1:23:04.188 --> 1:23:06.523
You're not going to run like her, right?

1:23:17.117 --> 1:23:18.202
He's coming.

1:25:18.447 --> 1:25:21.325
Miss Pat? Why are you running?

1:25:22.034 --> 1:25:24.036
Isn't this what you wanted?

1:25:31.001 --> 1:25:34.504
Now we'll know
what they all say and think.

1:25:35.464 --> 1:25:37.174
You no longer have to ask.

1:25:38.091 --> 1:25:42.721
Eri, don't do this, please, let's talk.
Let Julian go.

1:25:46.224 --> 1:25:47.684
He's coming.

1:27:40.005 --> 1:27:41.339
Help!

1:27:50.849 --> 1:27:52.142
Help!

1:28:24.257 --> 1:28:25.133
Eri!

1:29:43.670 --> 1:29:46.506
<i>I never saw them again after that night.</i>

1:29:50.385 --> 1:29:53.013
Eri, or Clara.

1:29:56.641 --> 1:29:58.727
I don't know where they went.

1:30:02.731 --> 1:30:04.608
It's now quiet here at Sta. Lucia...

1:30:08.028 --> 1:30:09.487
Too quiet.

1:30:13.533 --> 1:30:15.994
I don't know what to say anymore...

1:30:18.330 --> 1:30:19.456
to Julian...

1:30:20.707 --> 1:30:21.958
to the police...

1:30:23.627 --> 1:30:24.794
to Sor Alice.

1:30:28.381 --> 1:30:30.300
I don't have anyone to talk to.

1:30:32.177 --> 1:30:33.887
No one's going to believe me anyway.

1:30:37.390 --> 1:30:38.975
If Fidel really killed Clara...

1:30:39.976 --> 1:30:42.228
there's nothing I can do for him...

1:30:46.191 --> 1:30:47.400
or for Eri.

1:32:33.798 --> 1:32:34.758
Joyce?

1:33:09.626 --> 1:33:10.502
Joyce?

1:33:10.752 --> 1:33:12.837
Joyce! Joyce!

1:33:18.051 --> 1:33:18.927
Joyce!

1:33:34.359 --> 1:33:35.276
Joyce!

1:33:48.456 --> 1:33:49.499
Miss Pa--

1:33:51.209 --> 1:33:52.085
Miss Pat,

1:33:53.044 --> 1:33:54.712
if you can hear me...

1:33:57.423 --> 1:34:00.051
If you can really hear me,
please, help me.

1:34:15.775 --> 1:34:16.818
Joyce!

1:35:01.571 --> 1:35:03.239
<i>I'm right here, Joyce.</i>

1:35:08.536 --> 1:35:09.787
<i>I'll always be here.</i>
