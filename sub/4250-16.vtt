09:59.807 --> 10:00.891
[electronic ding]

10:00.975 --> 10:02.601
- SQUEE!

10:02.685 --> 10:04.812
AMBER ACCEPTED
MY FRIEND REQUEST.

10:04.895 --> 10:06.188
TEN TIMES--
IT IS WORKING.

10:06.272 --> 10:08.566
[giggles]

10:08.649 --> 10:10.359
[alarm blaring]

10:10.443 --> 10:12.778
OH, NO.

10:12.862 --> 10:13.321
MARA!

10:13.404 --> 10:16.365
[whimpering]

10:16.449 --> 10:17.575
FIRE!

10:17.658 --> 10:19.160
- OH, NO.

10:19.243 --> 10:20.828
- I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG
IT'S BEEN GOING ON.

10:20.911 --> 10:21.537
WE COULD BE BURNT ALIVE.

10:21.620 --> 10:24.165
AND I GET HEATSTROKE.

10:24.248 --> 10:25.416
[whimpering]

10:25.499 --> 10:27.710
- OOH, PERHAPS I SHOULD CHECK
THE CELLAR, TRUDY.

10:27.793 --> 10:29.045
- WHAT?
NO.

10:29.128 --> 10:31.213
- NO, THE BOILER MIGHT HAVE
OVERHEATED OR SOMETHING.

10:31.297 --> 10:34.216
- NO, STEP AWAY
FROM THE CELLAR DOOR, PATRICIA.

10:34.300 --> 10:35.926
STEP AWAY FROM THE CELLAR DOOR,
PATRICIA.

10:36.010 --> 10:37.720
- LEWIS, IS THIS YOUR DOING?

10:37.803 --> 10:39.305
- I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT IT, DUDE.

10:39.388 --> 10:41.390
- SQUEE!

10:41.474 --> 10:43.059
OUT OF ME WAY.
OUT OF ME WAY.

10:43.142 --> 10:44.352
OUT OF MY WAY.
OUT OF MY WAY.

10:44.435 --> 10:45.061
- OH, WILLOW.

10:45.144 --> 10:47.396
RELAX, HMM.

10:47.480 --> 10:48.356
STOP, HMM.

10:48.439 --> 10:50.441
- I'M SICK AND TIRED.

10:50.524 --> 10:52.443
- ALFIE, ALFIE,
A LITTLE HELP OVER HERE.

10:52.526 --> 10:53.194
- OH, YES.

10:53.277 --> 10:56.197
[alarm blaring]

10:56.280 --> 10:57.031
- MOVE ASIDE.

10:57.114 --> 10:58.574
- OH, VICTOR, THANK GOODNESS.

10:58.657 --> 10:59.617
AS YOU CAN SEE--

10:59.700 --> 11:02.161
- NO RUNNING ON THE STAIRS,
VICTOR.

11:04.497 --> 11:07.750
- ALFIE AND PATRICIA, STOP.

11:07.833 --> 11:08.250
STAY HERE, PLEASE.

11:08.334 --> 11:09.335
[alarm blaring]

11:09.418 --> 11:12.088
- CAN YOU COME IN HERE?

11:12.171 --> 11:14.256
- I JUST NEED EVERYONE
TO STAY TOGETHER.

11:14.340 --> 11:15.216
JEROME, COME BACK HERE!

11:15.299 --> 11:16.258
- I'LL GO GET HIM.

11:16.342 --> 11:17.218
- OH, GOOD IDEA, ALFIE.

11:17.301 --> 11:18.260
I'LL GET HIM TOO.

11:18.344 --> 11:20.221
- PATRICIA!

11:20.304 --> 11:21.555
- WHOA.
- WHOA.

11:21.639 --> 11:24.141
GET BACK TO THE ENTRANCE HALL.

11:26.102 --> 11:29.021
- WHERE DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE GOING?

11:32.066 --> 11:32.400
[alarm blaring]

11:32.483 --> 11:33.943
- WELL?

11:34.026 --> 11:35.903
I'M STILL WAITING.

11:35.986 --> 11:37.697
WHERE WERE YOU GOING?

11:37.780 --> 11:39.949
- UH, MY EARS
ARE VERY DELICATE, MISS.

11:40.032 --> 11:42.410
AND THE ALARM
COULD PERMANENTLY DEAFEN ME.

11:42.493 --> 11:43.244
- AND WHY SHOULD I BELIEVE THAT?

11:43.327 --> 11:45.538
- WHAT?
- SEE?

11:45.621 --> 11:46.789
HE'S GOING DEAF ALREADY.
- THERE IS NO FIRE.

11:46.872 --> 11:49.875
SOMEONE SET OFF THAT ALARM
DELIBERATELY!

11:49.959 --> 11:54.547
AND THEY SHALL PAY DEARLY
FOR THEIR EFFRONTERY!

11:54.630 --> 11:55.589
- WELL, THE ALARM'S STOPPED NOW,

11:55.673 --> 11:58.509
SO YOU CAN BOTH SAFELY
GO BACK INSIDE,

11:58.592 --> 12:01.011
OR RISK A LONG-TERM DETENTION.

12:01.095 --> 12:02.847
- OH, HARSH.

12:03.514 --> 12:06.183
- WELL, YOU HEARD THAT.

12:07.852 --> 12:10.229
- WELL, YOU'LL BE RELIEVED
TO KNOW IT WAS A FALSE ALARM.

12:10.312 --> 12:11.397
BUT WE STILL NEED
TO FOLLOW PROCEDURE,

12:11.480 --> 12:13.649
SO EVERYONE STAY STILL
UNTIL I DO A HEAD COUNT.

12:13.732 --> 12:14.775
- SO NOW WE'RE IN TROUBLE
FOR SETTING OFF THE ALARM,

12:14.859 --> 12:16.986
AND WE CAN'T GET BACK
TO THE CRYPT.

12:17.069 --> 12:18.070
DO YOU HAVE A PLAN "B"?

12:18.154 --> 12:19.155
- THAT WAS PLAN "B."

12:19.238 --> 12:19.864
- THEN YOU BETTER
HAVE A PLAN "C."

12:22.491 --> 12:23.617
- JEROME.
- AH!

12:23.701 --> 12:25.244
- HEY.
- SILENCE!

12:30.291 --> 12:30.875
- WHAT IS THIS?

12:30.958 --> 12:32.918
- AH, THANKS VICTOR.

12:33.002 --> 12:34.044
WOULDN'T WANT TO LOSE THAT.

12:34.128 --> 12:35.421
- WHAT?
WHAT IS IT?

12:35.504 --> 12:38.507
- NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT,
MISS DENBY.

12:38.591 --> 12:40.301
- HAND IT OVER, WILLIAMSON.

12:40.384 --> 12:41.677
- BUT IT'S MINE.

12:41.760 --> 12:44.138
I FOUND IT AGES AGO.

12:44.221 --> 12:46.348
AND YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY,
"FINDERS, KEEPERS."

12:46.432 --> 12:48.851
- I DO NOT BELIEVE IN SAYINGS.

12:48.934 --> 12:51.479
GIVE.

13:01.822 --> 13:05.034
- THE FIRE ALARM,
IT STOPPED.

13:08.120 --> 13:09.246
- I THINK IT WORKED.

13:09.330 --> 13:11.248
VICTOR AND CO. HAVE CLEARED OFF.

13:11.332 --> 13:12.708
- [sighs]

13:12.791 --> 13:14.084
YEAH, OR THEY
COULD BE ON THE OTHER SIDE

13:14.168 --> 13:14.752
OF THAT DOOR RIGHT NOW.

13:14.835 --> 13:16.462
- YEAH, THEY COULD BE...

13:16.545 --> 13:18.339
LISTENING TO US.

13:18.422 --> 13:20.216
- GUYS, IT'LL BE ALL RIGHT,
OKAY?

13:20.299 --> 13:21.550
WE'LL GET OUT OF HERE
IN NO TIME.

13:21.634 --> 13:22.885
PATRICIA WILL PROBABLY BE HERE
ANY MINUTE.

13:22.968 --> 13:25.679
- WELL, MAYBE THERE'S
ANOTHER WAY OUT.

13:28.140 --> 13:30.559
- YEAH, THE EMERGENCY,
EMERGENCY EXIT--

13:30.643 --> 13:32.478
ALL CRYPTS HAVE THOSE.

13:32.561 --> 13:34.730
- I HOPE THAT
WAS JUST A FALSE ALARM.

13:34.813 --> 13:37.358
I'D HATE TO THINK
THAT ANY OF THE OTHERS GOT HURT.

13:37.441 --> 13:40.402
WHA--WHAT IF THEY DID?

13:40.486 --> 13:41.779
ALFIE AND PATRICIA
WERE THE ONLY ONES

13:41.862 --> 13:43.072
WHO KNEW THAT WE WERE DOWN HERE.

13:43.155 --> 13:44.114
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I--

13:44.198 --> 13:45.282
- HEY, HEY.

13:45.366 --> 13:46.242
HEY.

13:46.325 --> 13:47.493
- [grunts]

13:47.576 --> 13:49.662
- ENOUGH
OF THE "WHAT IFs," OKAY?

13:49.745 --> 13:50.704
- OKAY.

13:50.788 --> 13:52.998
- OKAY.
- OKAY.

13:53.082 --> 13:55.918
- OKAY, NOW LET'S HELP FABIAN
LOOK FOR A WAY OUT.

13:56.001 --> 13:58.546
THERE'S GOT TO BE A CLUE
AROUND HERE SOMEWHERE.

13:58.629 --> 13:59.296
THERE'S ALWAYS ANOTHER CLUE.

13:59.380 --> 14:01.757
RIGHT, FABIAN?

14:01.840 --> 14:02.800
- YEAH.

14:02.883 --> 14:04.885
YEAH, THERE'S ALWAYS A CLUE.

14:09.515 --> 14:12.142
[gas hisses]

14:12.226 --> 14:14.019
- WILLOW.
- YES.

14:14.103 --> 14:15.020
- JEROME.

14:15.104 --> 14:16.021
- [grunts]

14:16.105 --> 14:17.565
- MARA.
- YEAH.

14:17.648 --> 14:18.816
- JOY.

14:18.899 --> 14:19.775
JOY?

14:19.858 --> 14:20.776
- YES.

14:20.859 --> 14:21.735
- OH.

14:21.819 --> 14:22.861
- WELCOME TO ANUBIS HOUSE.

14:22.945 --> 14:24.154
THERE'S ALWAYS SOMETHING
GOING ON.

14:24.238 --> 14:25.573
- ALFIE.

14:25.656 --> 14:27.283
- MM, GUACAMOLE.

14:27.366 --> 14:28.117
DID YOU ORDER THAT TO GO?

14:28.200 --> 14:29.952
[laughs]

14:30.035 --> 14:34.123
- AND WITH EDDIE WITH KT
AND FABIAN AT THE HOSPITAL,

14:34.206 --> 14:34.790
THAT SHOULD BE EVERYONE.

14:34.873 --> 14:36.792
- THANK YOU, TRUDY.

14:36.875 --> 14:41.088
RIGHT, OFF TO YOUR ROOMS
IN AN ORDERLY FASHION.

14:43.549 --> 14:44.633
- WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO NOW?

14:44.717 --> 14:46.385
VICTOR'S GOT THE KEY
TO THE CRYPT.

14:46.468 --> 14:48.220
- I DON'T KNOW,
TRY AND GET IT BACK.

14:48.304 --> 14:49.763
- WELL, MEET ME HERE--

14:49.847 --> 14:51.515
- I SAID QUIET!

14:51.599 --> 14:52.641
- IT'S ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY.

14:52.725 --> 14:53.892
CALM DOWN, CALM DOWN.

14:53.976 --> 14:55.269
I AM HERE NOW.

14:55.352 --> 14:57.354
- OH, GOOD, WE'RE SAVED.

14:57.438 --> 15:00.399
- [sighs]

15:05.946 --> 15:08.574
[cell phone chimes]

15:14.121 --> 15:15.748
- I LIKE MARA.

15:26.216 --> 15:30.554
ANOTHER FINE MESS, CLARKE.

15:30.638 --> 15:33.015
- WHERE WERE YOU, ANYWAY?

15:33.098 --> 15:38.354
- ME AND ALFIE WENT TO HOSPITAL
TO VISIT FABIAN.

15:38.437 --> 15:41.148
WE JUST GOT BACK IN
WHEN THE ALARM WAS GOING OFF.

15:44.276 --> 15:45.277
WHAT?

15:45.361 --> 15:48.113
- LOOK,
I KNOW YOU'VE RE-FORMED SIBUNA.

15:48.197 --> 15:51.283
PATRICIA,
NO ONE WAS AT THE HOSPITAL.

15:51.367 --> 15:53.035
THANKS FOR THE MEMO,
BY THE WAY.

15:53.118 --> 15:55.037
- LOOK, YOU KNOW
YOU CAN BE A PART OF IT.

15:55.120 --> 15:57.623
I JUST THOUGHT,
WHAT, WITH FABIAN--

15:57.706 --> 15:59.375
- I'LL SIT THIS ONE OUT,
THANKS.

16:00.501 --> 16:01.502
I JUST HOPE,
WHATEVER YOU'RE DOING,

16:01.585 --> 16:03.754
YOU GET THEM BACK.

16:04.880 --> 16:07.049
- YEAH, THEY'LL BE BACK SOON.

16:09.718 --> 16:10.886
[sighs]

16:10.969 --> 16:13.764
I JUST HAVE TO FIGURE OUT
A WAY TO GET TO THEM.

16:17.976 --> 16:20.312
- STILL NO SIGNAL.

16:20.396 --> 16:22.898
- HEY, GUYS.

16:22.981 --> 16:25.067
WHAT ABOUT THIS?

16:25.150 --> 16:26.819
- A STICK?

16:26.902 --> 16:28.904
- MM-MM, SPEAR.

16:28.987 --> 16:30.072
- WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

16:30.155 --> 16:32.408
- WELL, IN ANCIENT
EGYPTIAN TRADITION,

16:32.491 --> 16:33.826
THE SPEAR OR SCEPTER...

16:33.909 --> 16:35.285
- OR A STICK.

16:35.369 --> 16:38.247
- REPRESENTED POWER
OR DOMINATION.

16:38.330 --> 16:39.957
SO...
- SO...

16:40.040 --> 16:40.999
- SO...

16:41.083 --> 16:42.126
- SO...

16:42.209 --> 16:43.210
- UM...

16:43.293 --> 16:45.671
- TRY PRIZING THE DOOR OPEN.

16:45.754 --> 16:46.672
A LITTLE HELP.

16:46.755 --> 16:47.673
- YEAH, YEAH.

16:47.756 --> 16:49.341
- TAKE--ONE.

16:49.425 --> 16:51.301
[metal scraping]

16:51.385 --> 16:52.344
- AH, IT'S NOT MOVING.

16:52.428 --> 16:54.596
- [grunts]

16:54.680 --> 16:56.557
YOU KNOW, UM...

16:57.808 --> 17:00.728
I WAS THINKING.

17:00.811 --> 17:02.855
DO YOU THINK
THIS CEREMONY FAILED

17:02.938 --> 17:03.814
BECAUSE OF ME?

17:03.897 --> 17:06.066
- NO WAY, YOU'RE THE OSIRIAN.

17:06.150 --> 17:09.111
- I'M NOT SO SURE I KNOW
WHAT THAT MEANS ANYMORE.

17:09.194 --> 17:11.195
- WELL, IT MEANS
YOU'RE PART OF THE TEAM.

17:11.280 --> 17:13.198
- YOU GUYS WERE DOING JUST FINE
BEFORE I GOT HERE.

17:13.281 --> 17:17.077
- I HARDLY THINK NEARLY
LOSING MY GIRLFRIEND TWICE

17:17.161 --> 17:20.705
TO AN ANCIENT EGYPTIAN CURSE
QUALIFIES AS "DOING JUST FINE."

17:22.332 --> 17:27.628
EDDIE, I SPEND HOURS ONLINE
AND IN THE LIBRARY

17:27.713 --> 17:29.882
FINDING STUFF OUT.

17:29.965 --> 17:31.467
IT'S MY THING, BUT YOU--

17:31.550 --> 17:35.804
YOU JUST GET ON AND DO IT.

17:35.888 --> 17:36.972
- I GUESS.

17:37.055 --> 17:40.225
- OSIRIAN OR NOT,
SIBUNA NEEDS YOU, EDDIE.

17:43.479 --> 17:46.106
- I GUESS--I GUESS
I KIND OF NEED YOU GUYS TOO.

17:48.776 --> 17:51.153
- WHAT ARE WE DOING UP HERE?

17:51.236 --> 17:53.781
WE NEED TO GET BACK
TO THE CRYPT NOW.

17:53.864 --> 17:56.325
- HARRIET, I SAID THIS
WILL WAIT TILL THE MORNING.

17:56.408 --> 17:59.411
LOOK WHAT HAPPENS WHEN
WE TURN OUR BACK FOR A MOMENT:

17:59.495 --> 18:00.078
CHAOS.

18:00.162 --> 18:02.039
- OH, HARDLY CHAOS.

18:02.122 --> 18:03.540
IT'S JUST A FIRE DRILL.

18:03.624 --> 18:05.834
- NOT A DRILL.

18:05.918 --> 18:08.462
SOMEBODY SET THAT ALARM OFF
DELIBERATELY.

18:08.545 --> 18:10.380
- YES, I HOPE YOU'RE
GOING TO FIND THE CULPRITS

18:10.464 --> 18:11.465
AND EXPEL THEM.

18:11.548 --> 18:12.674
- I'M NOT GOING
TO DRAW ATTENTION

18:12.758 --> 18:13.842
TO THE INCIDENT AT ALL.

18:13.926 --> 18:15.010
- WHY EVER NOT?

18:15.093 --> 18:16.053
- BECAUSE I DO NOT WANT
TO ADVERTISE THE FACT

18:16.136 --> 18:20.307
THAT WE WERE ALL AWAY
FROM OUR POSTS.

18:20.390 --> 18:23.352
- YES, WE MUST
KEEP UP APPEARANCES,

18:23.435 --> 18:24.937
JUST UNTIL THE END OF THE WEEK.

18:25.020 --> 18:26.105
- YES, AND WE
MUST GET ROBERT BACK

18:26.188 --> 18:27.815
IN HIS RIGHTFUL PLACE BY THEN.

18:27.898 --> 18:30.317
- THERE IS STILL ONE MORE THING
OUTSTANDING.

18:30.400 --> 18:32.194
- AND WHAT'S THAT?

18:32.277 --> 18:34.112
- THE SMALL MATTER OF THE KEY,

18:34.196 --> 18:38.325
OR SPECIFICALLY,
MISS DENBY'S KEY.

18:38.408 --> 18:39.326
- WHERE DID YOU GET THAT?

18:39.409 --> 18:40.661
- THE WILLIAMSON GIRL HAD IT.

18:40.744 --> 18:42.246
- HOW--
WELL, HOW DID SHE GET HOLD--

18:42.329 --> 18:45.040
- WELL, IF ANYONE CAN ANSWER
THAT QUESTION FOR US, HARRIET,

18:45.124 --> 18:46.834
I SUGGEST IT MIGHT BE YOU.

18:46.917 --> 18:48.210
- GIVE IT BACK.
- NO.

18:48.293 --> 18:50.754
NO, YOU'RE CLEARLY NOT CAPABLE
OF LOOKING AFTER IT

18:50.838 --> 18:52.172
ANY MORE THAN YOU'RE CAPABLE

18:52.256 --> 18:53.423
OF LOOKING AFTER
FROBISHER-SMYTHE.

18:53.507 --> 18:57.302
NO, I SHALL BE KEEPING AHOLD
OF THIS FROM NOW ON.

18:57.386 --> 18:59.221
- OH, DON'T BE ABSURD.

18:59.304 --> 19:00.597
I HAD EVERYTHING
