01:02.729 --> 01:04.106
Wake up.

01:16.702 --> 01:18.829
Morning, mr prentiss.
You're up early.

01:19.037 --> 01:21.540
Up early?
I'm on nights this week.

02:29.691 --> 02:34.154
Male singer: J“ I'm losing sleep
'cause I've got to keep an eye on you

02:35.697 --> 02:40.535
j“ you cannot be trusted for one night

02:41.495 --> 02:44.039
j“ you're at home but you're not alone

02:44.122 --> 02:45.957
j“ I know that's true

02:46.917 --> 02:49.378
j“ I got information from

02:50.295 --> 02:55.676
j“ information from my private eye

02:55.801 --> 02:58.553
j“ I can't mention names
but I heard of the games

02:58.679 --> 03:00.639
j“ have been going on

03:02.015 --> 03:07.020
j“ you've been double-dealing
left and right

03:07.521 --> 03:10.315
j“ and it hurts me so
but I got to know

03:10.440 --> 03:12.526
j“ be it right or wrong

03:12.984 --> 03:16.279
j“ all that information from

03:16.738 --> 03:21.284
j“ information from my private eye

03:22.452 --> 03:24.871
j“ my private eye

03:25.414 --> 03:28.041
j“ gonna keep tabs, gonna tell a story

03:28.375 --> 03:30.752
j“ my private eye

03:31.211 --> 03:33.505
j“ always checkin' up on you

03:33.672 --> 03:36.758
j“ oh, my private eye

03:36.967 --> 03:40.095
j“ got a lot of friends, gonna tell a story

03:40.220 --> 03:42.639
j“ callin' all cars,
it's a quarter to three

03:42.806 --> 03:45.434
j“ there's nobody home
and it's worrying me

03:45.559 --> 03:50.480
j“ it goes without saying
that she's only playing with me j“

04:07.456 --> 04:09.082
It's true, you know.

04:09.166 --> 04:11.543
Crime is on the increase.

04:11.668 --> 04:14.463
Certainly too much
for the police to handle.

04:15.297 --> 04:17.549
That's where people like us come in.

04:17.716 --> 04:19.968
Oh, I'm Bob west, by the way.
Private detective.

04:20.093 --> 04:22.929
Excuse me. Can you tell me
where flash street is, please?

04:23.054 --> 04:25.766
Yeah, you go through
the first set of traffic lights,

04:25.891 --> 04:27.934
to the second set,
and then you turn left.

04:28.059 --> 04:29.936
- Thanks, mate.
- All right.

04:30.562 --> 04:32.814
You see, the trouble with
most people today

04:32.898 --> 04:34.149
is they're not observant.

04:34.274 --> 04:35.901
They walk around
with their eyes closed,

04:36.067 --> 04:38.361
and that's just what
the criminal type's looking for.

04:43.617 --> 04:45.243
This is where I work.

04:45.368 --> 04:48.163
If ever there was a glamorous job,
this has gotta be it.

04:48.288 --> 04:50.415
Fast cars, private yachts.

04:50.540 --> 04:53.335
Flying off to assignments
in exotic places.

04:53.418 --> 04:55.003
Fantastic.

04:55.378 --> 04:56.463
Not that I do any of that,

04:56.546 --> 04:58.882
but the bloke I work for,
he does it all the time.

05:08.099 --> 05:09.643
And, of course, need I say it?

05:09.726 --> 05:10.852
Women.

05:12.854 --> 05:16.900
You know, I've never known a fella cram
so many beautiful women into one day.

05:16.983 --> 05:20.278
My boss goes through secretaries
like a chain-smoker.

05:20.403 --> 05:22.906
This one only started this morning.

05:27.118 --> 05:30.497
Amateur. Peering through keyholes
is for the amateur.

05:30.580 --> 05:31.748
I wasn't actually, mr Blake.

05:31.873 --> 05:33.768
I just thought I'd dropped
something on the floor.

05:33.792 --> 05:36.378
Mmm. Bugging.
Now, that's the professional way.

05:36.503 --> 05:37.337
Bugging.

05:37.420 --> 05:40.131
Yes. And, like everything else,
purely a matter of technique.

05:40.257 --> 05:41.818
Now you stick with me,
and you'll soon learn

05:41.842 --> 05:43.927
to be a successful bugger.

05:48.682 --> 05:51.977
Hurry up, miss Walker. I want
to be out of here in five minutes.

05:58.316 --> 06:00.235
Blake: Case, Robert, case.

06:00.819 --> 06:03.613
You mean you want me to handle one
while you're away, mr Blake?

06:03.780 --> 06:06.783
No, I want you to hand me one now.

06:06.908 --> 06:08.326
- My briefcase.
- Oh.

06:08.451 --> 06:09.720
I trust I'm doing the right thing,

06:09.744 --> 06:11.784
leaving you in charge of this office
while I'm away.

06:11.872 --> 06:14.475
I'll handle things while you're away,
mr Blake. Don't you worry about that.

06:14.499 --> 06:17.335
Watch it! But that's just it,
I don't want you to handle things.

06:17.460 --> 06:20.046
Just keep an eye on the place.
That'll be quite sufficient.

06:20.171 --> 06:21.339
Well...

06:22.173 --> 06:23.693
Is there nothing I can do
while you're away?

06:23.717 --> 06:25.927
I mean, finish off
a case or something?

06:26.052 --> 06:27.971
To work on
even the simplest of cases

06:28.054 --> 06:30.432
requires a vast
reservoir of experience.

06:30.515 --> 06:32.100
Well, I've been here
three months.

06:32.225 --> 06:34.603
Look, I'm talking of years,
Robert, years.

06:34.769 --> 06:37.981
You haven't even asked me
to follow anybody yet.

06:39.524 --> 06:41.818
Right, I shall be gone
for about four days.

06:41.902 --> 06:43.546
Any problems, you know
where to contact me.

06:43.570 --> 06:44.988
Hotel majestic, Beirut.

06:45.155 --> 06:47.407
Oh, by the way, I've arranged
for a temporary secretary

06:47.490 --> 06:49.326
to deputise for miss Walker.
All right?

06:49.409 --> 06:52.013
She should have been here
first thing this morning, but she's late.

06:52.037 --> 06:54.223
- Right, miss Walker.
- Don't you worry about a thing, mr Blake.

06:54.247 --> 06:56.309
I'll make sure everything's
running smoothly for you.

06:56.333 --> 06:58.084
Look, just take the messages,
that's all.

06:58.209 --> 07:00.503
Don't start messing in things
which don't concern you.

07:00.629 --> 07:02.547
No, I wouldn't dream of it.

07:02.714 --> 07:04.299
Blake: Come on.

07:07.052 --> 07:08.762
Have a nice time.

07:27.614 --> 07:28.740
Hello.

07:34.955 --> 07:37.082
That'll be the new secretary, I bet.

07:37.207 --> 07:39.167
Oh, I can just see her now.

07:39.292 --> 07:41.002
Soft blonde hair,

07:41.086 --> 07:43.713
lovely, slender little body,

07:43.880 --> 07:45.674
deep sensitive eyes.

07:47.133 --> 07:48.843
Gubbidge. Maud gubbidge.

07:48.927 --> 07:51.179
I'm the new secretary
from rent-a-temp.

07:53.264 --> 07:54.724
Rent-a-what?

07:56.184 --> 07:57.769
But there must be a mistake.
I mean...

07:57.894 --> 08:00.271
This is the Blake detective agency,
isn't it?

08:00.397 --> 08:03.108
I was told to report to a mr west.
Is that you?

08:03.274 --> 08:05.485
Well, yeah, but I was expecting
somebody a bit...

08:05.610 --> 08:08.488
- Older?
- Well...

08:08.613 --> 08:10.031
Now, the last boss I had,

08:10.115 --> 08:12.367
he kept making
improper suggestions to me.

08:12.492 --> 08:14.244
I hope you're not
going to be like that.

08:14.327 --> 08:16.955
- Like what?
- Keep making improper suggestions.

08:17.080 --> 08:18.999
Oh, no... way.

08:19.124 --> 08:24.713
Good. As long as the only thing I have
to take down is shorthand, I don't mind.

08:24.838 --> 08:27.841
You see, er... it was my body
that was the trouble.

08:27.966 --> 08:28.883
Yeah, I can see that.

08:28.967 --> 08:30.802
- He couldn't keep his hands off it.
- Really.

08:30.969 --> 08:34.389
It got so bad, it was just unbearable,
so I had to hand in my notice.

08:34.556 --> 08:37.100
He said I aroused
his primeval impulse.

08:37.183 --> 08:38.494
Mind you...

08:38.518 --> 08:40.238
I seem to have that effect
on men, you know.

08:40.353 --> 08:41.688
Well, if, er...

08:41.771 --> 08:45.066
If you wouldn't mind answering
the door, please, miss, er...

08:45.233 --> 08:47.402
Gubbidge. Maud gubbidge.

08:52.240 --> 08:55.452
- Yes, what do you want?
- Blake detective agency?

08:55.577 --> 08:57.996
- That'll be all right, miss garbage.
- Gubbidge.

08:58.121 --> 09:00.957
- Yes, yes. If you'd like to step this way.
- Mr judd Blake?

09:01.082 --> 09:02.292
Well...

09:04.961 --> 09:07.213
- Laura Sutton.
- How do you do?

09:12.343 --> 09:15.180
Mr Blake, I'll come
straight to the point.

09:15.305 --> 09:17.682
I want you to handle a case
for me immediately.

09:17.807 --> 09:21.519
- Oh, yes. But I'm not...
- No, no, no. I'll explain.

09:21.644 --> 09:24.439
You see, I used to be
a professional model.

09:24.814 --> 09:28.359
And to be quite honest,
I led a rather...

09:28.443 --> 09:29.444
Wild life.

09:29.569 --> 09:32.322
That is, until I met Ashley.

09:32.447 --> 09:34.115
Ashley dotrice.

09:34.199 --> 09:36.951
Then, it was love at first sight.

09:37.243 --> 09:39.120
The fact that he was eighty-seven,

09:39.204 --> 09:41.414
a multi-millionaire
with a bad heart condition,

09:41.539 --> 09:43.416
had nothing to do with it, naturally.

09:43.500 --> 09:44.935
Well, naturally. But, you see,
the thing is, I'm not...

09:44.959 --> 09:46.836
And, last week,
we were supposed to be married.

09:47.003 --> 09:50.215
Well, I thought it best
we didn't have a long engagement.

09:50.340 --> 09:53.968
I mean, he'd already had
three heart attacks since last Christmas.

09:54.135 --> 09:56.096
Last week,
he had a fourth and died.

09:56.179 --> 09:58.098
Oh, I'm very sorry.

09:58.181 --> 10:01.059
Hmm? Oh, yes, of course,
I was terribly upset.

10:01.142 --> 10:02.685
Now the point is

10:02.811 --> 10:06.731
that I'm due to inherit
his entire estate on the 25th.

10:06.898 --> 10:08.667
Well, that's very nice,
but the thing is, I...

10:08.691 --> 10:11.152
Yes, but you see,
the trouble is Ashley.

10:11.277 --> 10:12.779
Darling Ashley. You see,

10:12.862 --> 10:15.448
he was under the impression
that I was still a virgin.

10:15.573 --> 10:17.492
Oh, really?

10:18.368 --> 10:19.702
Really?

10:19.828 --> 10:24.499
According to the terms of the will,
I only inherit everything

10:24.582 --> 10:27.877
if I've done nothing to bring
the family name into disrepute.

10:27.961 --> 10:31.005
So, you see, I have a problem.

10:31.131 --> 10:33.842
- Problem?
- Well...

10:33.967 --> 10:35.218
I have a number of...

10:35.260 --> 10:37.220
Explicit photographs of myself

10:37.303 --> 10:39.639
with a gentleman in...

10:39.764 --> 10:42.517
A compromising situation.

10:42.642 --> 10:44.727
- Oh!
- I would like you to see them.

10:44.853 --> 10:47.856
- Oh, yeah. I'd love to, yeah.
- I feel I should explain...

10:47.939 --> 10:49.357
Well, just pass them over
and, en"

10:49.440 --> 10:50.733
let me have a look.

10:50.859 --> 10:54.404
You see, they came through the post
yesterday morning.

10:54.529 --> 10:57.282
Yes, well, I think I should, er...
Take a look, and, er...

10:57.407 --> 10:59.951
They came with a note
threatening to send them

11:00.076 --> 11:02.954
to Ashley's solicitor
unless I pay 50,000.

11:03.079 --> 11:04.640
Yes, well, I can see
you've got a problem there,

11:04.664 --> 11:06.559
but if I could just have a...
Have a look at them, er...

11:06.583 --> 11:09.961
Mr Blake, I'm at my wits' end.

11:10.712 --> 11:12.505
Oh, come on.
They can't be that bad.

11:22.682 --> 11:23.682
Wow.

11:24.017 --> 11:25.602
Exactly.

11:26.477 --> 11:29.147
Needless to say,
I don't have that kind of money.

11:30.398 --> 11:31.316
What?

11:31.399 --> 11:33.276
I said, I don't have
that kind of money.

11:33.401 --> 11:37.197
I can't touch any of the estate
until I inherit it on the 25th,

11:37.280 --> 11:39.741
and, if I ask for some kind
of a loan, then...

11:39.824 --> 11:42.660
Well, somebody
might get suspicious.

11:42.785 --> 11:44.162
You know, you...

11:44.245 --> 11:46.331
You photograph very well.

11:46.414 --> 11:47.457
Thank you.

11:48.291 --> 11:49.751
What I want you to do

11:49.834 --> 11:52.378
is to catch the blackmailer
and get me the negatives.

11:52.462 --> 11:54.714
It's incredible definition as well.

11:54.839 --> 11:56.257
You do see the position I'm in?

11:56.341 --> 11:58.968
You're in a very awkward position,
I can see that.

11:59.052 --> 12:02.764
But, mr Blake,
what do you think?

12:02.889 --> 12:05.099
Oh, I think they're great.

12:05.183 --> 12:07.727
Especially the one
with the stick of rock...

12:08.186 --> 12:10.939
Yes, well, um...

12:11.022 --> 12:15.902
I think I should be able to fit you in,
in between commitments.

12:16.027 --> 12:17.362
Who do you reckon it is?

12:17.487 --> 12:18.571
If I knew who it was,

12:18.655 --> 12:21.324
I wouldn't be here
employing you, mr Blake.

12:21.449 --> 12:23.117
Yes, quite.

12:23.284 --> 12:24.827
Just testing you, that's all.

12:24.994 --> 12:27.288
Well, I think I'll kick off by

12:27.372 --> 12:30.416
- following up a few leads.
- A few leads?

12:30.500 --> 12:32.335
Yes. You don't happen
to have any, do you?

12:32.460 --> 12:34.337
- Scott!
- Who?

12:34.420 --> 12:37.090
The person on the picture.

12:37.215 --> 12:39.801
Oh, yes, I hadn't noticed him.

12:39.884 --> 12:42.178
He's a photographer.

12:42.303 --> 12:45.348
It could have been
a set-up job, but...

12:45.515 --> 12:46.724
Yes, well.

12:46.849 --> 12:48.529
You know, I don't think
this is going to be

12:48.559 --> 12:50.812
a particularly difficult
case to solve, miss...

12:53.523 --> 12:54.691
Sutton.

12:54.816 --> 12:57.402
Just leave it with me
for a few days.

12:57.527 --> 12:59.028
Everything will be all right.

13:00.071 --> 13:01.823
Oh, don't worry.
They'll be, er...

13:01.906 --> 13:04.575
They'll be safely under lock and key.

13:04.659 --> 13:08.079
Everything is kept strictly
confidential in this business.

13:11.499 --> 13:12.583
You're out of your head.

13:12.667 --> 13:15.003
How can you take on
a job like this?

13:15.128 --> 13:16.939
It's amazing what you can do
with a garlic sausage.

13:16.963 --> 13:19.523
Oh, it's an open-and-shut case.
There's absolutely nothing to it.

13:19.632 --> 13:22.135
Anyway, it's a cucumber, isn't it?

13:22.218 --> 13:23.720
Nothing to it?

13:23.845 --> 13:26.282
You don't know the first thing
about being a private detective.

13:26.306 --> 13:27.348
It's definitely a sausage.

13:27.515 --> 13:29.475
I've seen the way Blake does it.
It's dead easy.

13:29.600 --> 13:31.978
It's just plain common sense.
Nothing more.

13:32.103 --> 13:33.646
I'll get these.

13:35.648 --> 13:37.734
It's all right, Bob, I'll get 'em.

13:38.776 --> 13:40.903
Anyway, I've got ambition, haven't I?

13:41.029 --> 13:44.699
If I hadn't, I'd probably still be stuck
in that boring old insurance office.

13:44.782 --> 13:47.368
Might be all right for you,
Derek, but me...

13:47.952 --> 13:49.579
I'm going places.

13:49.662 --> 13:51.873
I still say you're trying to run
before you can walk.

13:51.956 --> 13:53.958
Like you always do.

13:54.500 --> 13:56.919
That bicycle pump
must have been painful.

13:57.503 --> 14:00.298
Anyway, what about her thinking
you're Blake? That is fraud.

14:00.381 --> 14:02.342
Yeah, well, I'll tell her afterwards,

14:02.425 --> 14:03.718
when it's all over.

14:03.843 --> 14:06.220
All right, Sherlock,
what's your first move?

14:06.346 --> 14:09.557
Well, first, I'm gonna check out
this photographer guy.

14:09.682 --> 14:12.518
Do you know, I think
he's hiding the negatives at his flat.

14:12.643 --> 14:14.020
And what are you going to do?

14:14.145 --> 14:16.373
Knock on the door and say,
"excuse me, I'm a private detective.

14:16.397 --> 14:17.750
"I think you're
blackmailing my client.

14:17.774 --> 14:19.168
"Please, may I come in
and search the place?"

14:19.192 --> 14:22.862
Very funny. No, I'm gonna
go to that flat in disguise...

14:23.613 --> 14:25.615
Put them away.

14:35.625 --> 14:38.169
- Mr radleigh?
- Mr radleigh's out at the moment.

14:38.378 --> 14:40.588
Well, I'm from the, er...
Health department.

14:40.713 --> 14:42.673
Rodent and pest control.

14:42.799 --> 14:44.509
I've come to have
a look at your mice.

14:44.675 --> 14:47.220
- Mice? I haven't seen any mice.
- Oh.

14:48.679 --> 14:50.479
Well, anyway, I can't
hang about here all day.

14:50.556 --> 14:51.867
I mean, I've got
a schedule to keep to,

14:51.891 --> 14:54.143
and I've got to do
the whole area. Er...

14:55.561 --> 14:58.606
Well, I suppose it'll be all right.

15:11.160 --> 15:13.496
I do hope you're not
gonna make a mess.

15:13.579 --> 15:15.748
I've just done in here,
you know.

15:15.915 --> 15:18.334
No, no, I'll just, er...
Hunt round for any little signs,

15:18.418 --> 15:20.962
and, en" then lay a few traps.

15:27.802 --> 15:30.721
You don't do ants, do you?

15:30.847 --> 15:32.515
- W hat?
- Ants.

15:33.307 --> 15:34.851
Oh, yeah, we do 'em all.

15:34.934 --> 15:38.438
Ants, mice, rats,
cockroaches, weevils.

15:38.521 --> 15:41.399
Only, where I live,
they come in from the garden.

15:41.524 --> 15:42.692
Harry, that's my husband,

15:42.775 --> 15:46.737
he found a couple in his
cornflakes the other morning.

15:46.821 --> 15:51.325
I mean, there they were, just swimmin'
around as though they owned the place.

15:51.451 --> 15:53.453
Ant powder,
that's what you need.

15:53.578 --> 15:56.706
Well, you can't very well
put that in cornflakes, can you?

15:56.873 --> 15:59.250
I don't suppose
you'll find any in there.

16:00.626 --> 16:04.464
Well, you never know.
I mean, they eat all sorts, you know.

16:04.630 --> 16:07.008
Clothes, woodwork, paper...

16:09.677 --> 16:11.345
Photographs.

16:11.512 --> 16:13.473
You, er...

16:13.598 --> 16:15.766
You haven't got any photographs

16:15.892 --> 16:17.852
lying around, have you?
Or negatives?

16:17.977 --> 16:21.105
- They love negatives, you know.
- I wouldn't know about that.

16:21.189 --> 16:24.817
I'm just the home help.
You'd have to ask mr radleigh.

16:26.986 --> 16:31.199
Oh, I was just making myself
a nice cup of tea.

16:31.866 --> 16:33.659
I don't suppose you'd fancy one?

16:33.701 --> 16:36.496
That's very kind.
Thank you very much.

17:15.076 --> 17:18.204
Mrs horne:
What are you doing down there?

17:18.371 --> 17:20.665
Oh, just looking for droppings.

17:20.831 --> 17:25.503
Well, you won't find any of those.
I've only just hoovered.

17:25.711 --> 17:28.005
- Do you take sugar?
- No, thanks.

17:38.099 --> 17:42.103
Oh, yes. Well, I'm always finding
things like that about the place.

17:42.311 --> 17:44.063
He has women here, you know.

17:45.481 --> 17:47.567
I don't mind
the black ones so much.

17:47.650 --> 17:50.695
It's the big red ones
I can't stand.

17:52.738 --> 17:54.407
- W hat?
- Ants.

17:55.283 --> 17:56.534
Oh, ants.

17:56.659 --> 18:00.413
My Harry found a couple in his bed
the other night.

18:00.538 --> 18:02.498
Gave him a terrible fright.

18:02.540 --> 18:04.500
He thought it was crabs.

18:06.586 --> 18:08.838
Mind you, he's a funny man.

18:08.963 --> 18:12.341
He always did attract
nasty, creepy-crawly things.

18:14.468 --> 18:17.179
- Oh, my god, he's back already.
- What?

18:17.263 --> 18:19.557
Quick, clear these things up.

18:30.067 --> 18:33.279
Mrs horne: Oh, mr radleigh,
you did give me a surprise!

18:33.446 --> 18:35.573
I was just finishing off.

18:35.698 --> 18:37.199
Who's he?

18:37.325 --> 18:39.619
Well, I hope I did right, mr radleigh.

18:39.785 --> 18:42.246
This gentleman is from the government.

18:42.371 --> 18:44.624
From, er... pest control.

18:44.790 --> 18:45.790
Oh, yes?

18:45.833 --> 18:47.043
What are you, a free sample?

18:47.168 --> 18:49.420
He says he's come about the mice.

18:49.545 --> 18:51.255
He's come about the...

18:51.881 --> 18:54.675
- What mice?!
- Well, I'm investigating the...

18:54.800 --> 18:56.153
Yes, well, we haven't
got any around here,

18:56.177 --> 18:58.017
so go and do your
investigating somewhere else.

18:58.137 --> 18:59.180
- Go on.
- Goodbye.

18:59.305 --> 19:01.515
Where the bloody hell's my camera?

19:01.849 --> 19:05.645
Mrs horne, have you moved it?
'Cause I put it over there.

19:05.811 --> 19:08.898
Oh, yes.
I do remember seeing it.

19:08.981 --> 19:11.567
"Oh, yes. I do remember seeing it."

19:14.528 --> 19:17.573
Well, don't look at me,
I'm only the, er...

19:17.657 --> 19:18.741
Cleaner.

19:28.042 --> 19:29.752
What do you want to
borrow them for?

19:29.835 --> 19:31.545
I'm going to spy on him.

19:31.712 --> 19:34.006
What are you trying to do?
Get yourself arrested?

19:34.131 --> 19:35.692
Well, what I should have done
was bug the place.

19:35.716 --> 19:37.593
I mean, it's definitely him.

19:37.718 --> 19:41.597
Nasty type.
A blackmailer if ever I saw one.

19:41.722 --> 19:43.724
Did you get the negatives?

19:43.849 --> 19:45.476
No, but, er...

19:45.685 --> 19:47.395
I found a camera.

19:48.354 --> 19:49.480
That proves it.

19:49.563 --> 19:52.316
You twit!
What's that got to do with it?

19:52.441 --> 19:53.877
I've got a camera.
Everybody's got a camera.

19:53.901 --> 19:56.362
Yeah, but not like this one.
It had a big lens on it.

19:56.487 --> 19:58.465
Well, it would do, wouldn't it?
He's a photographer.

19:58.489 --> 20:00.241
Well, precisely.

20:00.366 --> 20:02.511
Look, why don't you just admit
you haven't got the faintest idea

20:02.535 --> 20:04.262
about what you're doing
and let's all get some rest.

20:04.286 --> 20:07.039
What, when I've nearly
solved the case?

20:08.082 --> 20:10.334
Anyway, look,
it's time I was going.

20:11.210 --> 20:14.922
Look, Derek, believe it or not,
I do know what I'm doing.

21:05.890 --> 21:07.617
Woman: Emergency.
Which service do you require?

21:07.641 --> 21:08.684
Police.

21:49.141 --> 21:52.520
I hope you don't think I do this
with every photographer I work with.

21:52.603 --> 21:53.646
No, of course not.

22:18.921 --> 22:20.506
Well, I can't see anyone.

22:20.631 --> 22:21.882
He must have gone.

22:22.007 --> 22:24.260
Only there was definitely
someone outside

22:24.343 --> 22:26.387
prowling about in the bushes.

22:26.554 --> 22:27.930
Now, now, miss friggin.

22:28.013 --> 22:30.808
That makes three you say
you've seen in the past week.

22:30.891 --> 22:33.352
Now, they can't all have been
sex maniacs, can they?

22:33.477 --> 22:36.480
Oh, I don't agree. There are
a lot of them about, you know.

22:36.564 --> 22:38.816
You've really no cause for alarm.

22:38.941 --> 22:41.694
A lot of them go for
older women now.

22:41.777 --> 22:43.571
It said so in the papers.

22:43.696 --> 22:46.073
Well, don't you worry
about it, miss friggin.

22:46.198 --> 22:49.076
Anyone tries to molest you,
we are only around the corner.

22:49.201 --> 22:51.161
Well, anyway, I always
look under my bed,

22:51.245 --> 22:52.538
just to make sure.

22:52.663 --> 22:54.290
But there's never anybody there.

22:54.373 --> 22:56.083
That's right.
You keep doing that.

22:56.250 --> 22:59.461
And I always wear a wedding ring
whenever I go out.

23:02.715 --> 23:04.717
It's where they hang about,
you know,

23:04.967 --> 23:06.427
behind those bushes.

23:16.395 --> 23:18.230
- Scott.
- Mmm?

23:18.647 --> 23:20.816
- What's this?
- Mmm?

23:20.858 --> 23:23.027
It feels like a lump of cheese.

23:23.193 --> 23:24.737
What?

23:29.033 --> 23:30.242
God knows.

23:30.326 --> 23:32.036
Right, where were we?

23:47.384 --> 23:51.555
Policeman: Oi! You down there.
Police. Hold it! Hey!

24:14.662 --> 24:17.665
Hello, love.
How did it go last night?

24:17.831 --> 24:19.166
Terrific.

24:19.625 --> 24:21.210
- Like my new outfit?
- Mmm?

24:21.335 --> 24:22.419
I couldn't resist it.

24:22.503 --> 24:25.631
Well, it's terribly me.
Don't you think?

24:25.756 --> 24:27.007
Yeah, it's...

24:27.091 --> 24:28.467
Terrible.

24:28.634 --> 24:30.594
Oh, er... that woman,

24:30.719 --> 24:33.639
- miss Sutton phoned up for you.
- Oh, yeah?

24:33.764 --> 24:34.807
Now, personally,

24:34.890 --> 24:37.243
I never liked the look of her,
the minute I clapped eyes on her.

24:37.267 --> 24:38.394
What did she want?

24:38.519 --> 24:40.646
I suppose some men
might find her attractive,

24:40.771 --> 24:42.531
but it's only the way
she's done her make-up.

24:42.606 --> 24:43.926
Yes, all right.
What did she want?

24:43.983 --> 24:46.777
Of course, I don't need any of that,
you understand,

24:46.860 --> 24:49.279
not with my basic primitive sexuality.

24:49.405 --> 24:50.656
Never mind all that.

24:50.739 --> 24:53.701
Mind you, a lot of it's to do
with the way you dress.

24:53.826 --> 24:57.121
- Look, miss cribbage.
- Gubbidge, but you can call me maud.

24:57.246 --> 24:59.265
Look, are you going to tell me
what she wanted, or not?

24:59.289 --> 25:01.291
She wants you to
go and stay with her.

25:03.002 --> 25:04.920
- She what?
- That's what she said.

25:05.045 --> 25:07.631
She wants you to catch a train
first thing tomorrow morning

25:07.756 --> 25:09.925
and go down and stay with her
in the country.

25:10.050 --> 25:12.219
Oh. Great.

25:31.238 --> 25:33.532
- Hello there.
- Hello, mr Blake.

25:39.496 --> 25:42.166
I suppose you are wondering
why I asked you down here.

25:42.291 --> 25:44.501
I think I can guess, Laura.

25:44.626 --> 25:47.254
Obviously, it mustn't appear
as if we're having an affair.

25:47.379 --> 25:49.048
Oh, I'll be very discreet,
don't worry.

25:49.173 --> 25:51.425
I mean, the slightest hint
of a scandal, and...

25:51.550 --> 25:52.843
Well, I'll lose everything.

25:52.968 --> 25:55.763
There's absolutely no need
for anybody to find out.

25:55.846 --> 25:56.972
Well, I have paved the way.

25:57.056 --> 25:59.558
I've said you're an old friend
just down for a few days.

25:59.725 --> 26:02.019
Good idea. Very good idea.

26:02.770 --> 26:04.063
Er, told who?

26:04.146 --> 26:07.816
Well, Ashley's relatives, of course.
They came down for the funeral.

26:07.900 --> 26:09.485
All key suspects,
obviously, huh?

26:09.610 --> 26:11.862
Well, they think that the estate
should have gone

26:11.945 --> 26:14.114
to his daughters,
Violet and medea.

26:14.281 --> 26:15.657
Oh, there you have your motive.

26:15.741 --> 26:19.369
And then, of course,
there's Violet's husband, Sydney,

26:19.536 --> 26:21.622
and her stepdaughter, Clarissa.

26:21.747 --> 26:25.209
Mmm. Well, I'll soon have
that lot sorted out.

26:25.334 --> 26:26.877
What you will find interesting

26:26.960 --> 26:29.463
is that Scott arrived
late last night

26:29.588 --> 26:31.131
and he's staying in the town.

26:31.256 --> 26:33.300
Oh, really? That is interesting.

26:33.425 --> 26:35.219
Very interesting.

26:35.803 --> 26:36.804
Hmm.

26:36.887 --> 26:38.514
Right, then, er...
Let's go, shall we?

26:38.639 --> 26:40.933
Oh, by the way, er...
Where are we going?

26:41.016 --> 26:42.976
Ashley's estate.

26:43.018 --> 26:45.104
Oh, I'd rather thought we'd have

26:45.187 --> 26:48.190
booked into some little hotel,
just the two of us.

26:48.273 --> 26:50.484
Whatever for?

26:50.609 --> 26:52.152
Well...

26:52.778 --> 26:55.697
Oh, Ashley's estate, grimsdyke manor.

26:57.116 --> 27:00.119
Grimsdyke manor.

27:09.461 --> 27:11.088
Craddock, this is mr Blake.

27:11.213 --> 27:13.066
Would you take his things
to the west wing, please?

27:13.090 --> 27:15.175
Craddock: Certainly, madam.

27:16.426 --> 27:18.804
Your coat, sir.

27:18.971 --> 27:22.266
- Pardon?
- Your coat, sir.

27:26.311 --> 27:27.604
Thank you.

27:29.565 --> 27:32.526
- Medea dotrice, judd Blake.
- Oh, how...

27:32.609 --> 27:34.778
Medea:
I see the Mark of death on you.

27:34.862 --> 27:36.697
Laura:
Judd's just staying for a few days.

27:36.780 --> 27:39.950
Yes, I can sense
he won't be with us for very long.

27:40.075 --> 27:42.494
I have the second sight.

27:45.706 --> 27:47.708
Would you like some breakfast?

27:47.833 --> 27:49.209
Breakfast?

27:51.753 --> 27:53.481
I expect you'll be hungry
after your journey.

27:53.505 --> 27:55.591
Oh, yes. Thanks very much.

27:55.716 --> 27:58.051
- Not there!
- Over here.

28:04.141 --> 28:06.852
This is Violet, medea's sister.

28:07.186 --> 28:09.313
Bob: Pleased to meet you.

28:12.441 --> 28:16.278
Oh, nothing passes between my lips
unless it's organic.

28:16.528 --> 28:19.323
Violet's a vegetarian.

28:19.489 --> 28:22.492
I notice you didn't introduce
your friend to me, Laura.

28:22.618 --> 28:25.746
Vi's my stepmother.
I'm Clarissa.

28:26.288 --> 28:27.456
Hello.

28:31.501 --> 28:33.253
Pig's flesh!

28:33.378 --> 28:35.964
And the embryo
of an unborn chicken.

28:37.716 --> 28:39.927
- I beg your pardon?
- On your plate.

28:40.093 --> 28:42.512
It's not good for you, you know.

28:42.638 --> 28:45.974
Medea: Oh... the tea leaves.

28:46.099 --> 28:49.102
I see nothing ahead but misery,

28:49.228 --> 28:50.854
torment,

28:50.938 --> 28:52.522
and blood.

28:53.774 --> 28:55.859
Man: Morning! Morning! Morning!

28:56.151 --> 28:59.071
Oh, god. Ah, breakfast.

29:00.948 --> 29:03.659
The morning is bright,
so don't look so glum,

29:03.742 --> 29:05.285
'cause, if you do,

29:05.369 --> 29:07.287
I shall smack your bum.

29:11.208 --> 29:13.543
Violet: Must you be so crude
first thing in the morning?

29:13.710 --> 29:16.630
You've no sense of humour, vi.
I've told you that before.

29:16.755 --> 29:19.675
Sense of humour?
Here? Knowing that...

29:19.758 --> 29:21.260
Oh!

29:21.843 --> 29:24.846
Let me introduce you.
Judd Blake, Sydney Burke.

29:26.723 --> 29:28.976
Ah, yes.

29:29.810 --> 29:31.103
Yes...

29:31.853 --> 29:34.022
Violet: Would you like some
vitamin and iron tablets?

29:34.147 --> 29:37.859
- They're very good for you, you know.
- Um... no, thanks.

29:41.822 --> 29:43.282
I've weak blood, you see.

29:43.407 --> 29:45.784
For god's sake, vi,
I'm trying to drink me breakfast.

29:46.034 --> 29:47.286
Blood!

29:48.787 --> 29:51.164
Sydney: Now, see what you've done.
You've set her off now.

29:51.290 --> 29:53.208
Oh, Syd, don't say
anything to upset me.

29:53.333 --> 29:55.335
You know how my nerves are.

29:55.419 --> 29:57.170
I can't take it any more.

29:57.337 --> 29:58.797
You, er...

29:58.880 --> 30:00.465
You all live here, do you?

30:00.632 --> 30:01.842
Here?

30:02.384 --> 30:04.177
Live here?

30:04.720 --> 30:06.513
Knowing that...

30:08.890 --> 30:12.185
No, we, er...
We have a house in esher.

30:12.352 --> 30:13.979
Sydney built it.

30:14.313 --> 30:15.897
He's a building contractor.

30:16.064 --> 30:19.484
Do you remember that block of flats
that fell down last year?

30:19.568 --> 30:20.569
They were his.

30:20.694 --> 30:22.696
Rows and rows of concrete,
all around the town.

30:22.779 --> 30:24.906
I forgot to put the girders in,
they all fell down!

30:29.119 --> 30:31.204
Sydney:
What business you in, then?

30:32.831 --> 30:34.666
- Er... ornithology.
- He's an 'orny-what?

30:34.875 --> 30:36.376
Laura: Bird watching.

30:41.381 --> 30:43.008
- Tits!
- Oh!

30:43.175 --> 30:46.595
You get to see a lot of those,
isuppose!

30:46.845 --> 30:48.114
Well, they're birds, aren't they?

30:48.138 --> 30:51.058
They call it
"the bird from hell".

30:51.183 --> 30:53.810
- What?
- Oh, it's just a superstition.

30:53.935 --> 30:55.354
Legend has it

30:55.437 --> 30:58.899
that all who are unfaithful
to the owners of grimsdyke manor

30:59.024 --> 31:04.279
shall die screaming
in the claws of a monstrous demon.

31:04.404 --> 31:05.822
Sydney: She means
that bloody great

31:05.906 --> 31:07.449
stuffed thing
hanging up in the hall.

31:07.574 --> 31:11.953
Sometimes at night, its ghostly voice
can be heard across the moors,

31:12.079 --> 31:14.664
screaming out for blood!

31:17.751 --> 31:20.212
Right, I'm off to the river.

31:20.295 --> 31:21.630
See you later, everybody.

31:21.838 --> 31:23.090
But you haven't eaten anything.

31:23.173 --> 31:24.841
Oh, do have a yeast tablet.

31:24.966 --> 31:26.551
No, thank you.

31:33.975 --> 31:36.311
I, er...

31:36.478 --> 31:39.564
I don't want to appear, er...
Curious, but tell me...

31:42.734 --> 31:43.860
Marmaduke.

31:47.072 --> 31:49.324
You silly bitch.

31:49.449 --> 31:51.410
Marmaduke grimsdyke.

31:51.827 --> 31:54.704
We don't talk about
marmaduke grimsdyke.

32:00.794 --> 32:04.172
There's a young gentleman outside
to see you, miss Sutton.

32:04.297 --> 32:05.757
A mr radleigh.

32:05.882 --> 32:08.362
Oh, thank you, craddock.
Will you tell him to wait in the hall?

32:08.427 --> 32:09.553
Craddock: Very good.

32:09.719 --> 32:13.432
Sydney: Not some dark secret from
your murky past, Laura, surely?

32:19.771 --> 32:21.440
So, how long have you
been here, then?

32:21.523 --> 32:24.734
Oh, two or three minutes.
Butler said to wait in the hall.

32:58.435 --> 32:59.978
Clarissa:
I say, what are you doing?

33:00.103 --> 33:01.980
- Oh, hello.
- What are you doing?

33:02.105 --> 33:03.773
I'm, er... bird spotting.

33:03.857 --> 33:05.192
How exciting.

33:05.400 --> 33:07.360
What was your name again?

33:07.444 --> 33:09.070
Judd. Judd Blake.

33:09.321 --> 33:11.865
You're not related to the
hurlington Blakes, by any chance?

33:12.032 --> 33:13.658
No, I shouldn't think so.

33:13.783 --> 33:15.827
I'm Clarissa.

33:17.120 --> 33:18.538
Yes, I remember.

33:18.622 --> 33:20.916
Do you fancy a little row
down the river?

33:21.041 --> 33:22.501
Well, um...

33:24.294 --> 33:26.338
Come on, it might be fun.

33:27.672 --> 33:29.799
All right, then.

33:36.806 --> 33:39.226
Hadn't you better untie it first?

33:58.620 --> 34:00.539
- Rowlocks.
- W hat?

34:00.622 --> 34:02.666
You haven't got them
in your rowlocks.

34:02.791 --> 34:04.584
Oh, yeah.

34:07.462 --> 34:09.881
- So, how long have you known her, then?
- Known who?

34:10.006 --> 34:12.467
- Laura.
- Not long.

34:12.634 --> 34:14.427
Weren't getting jealous, were you?

34:14.594 --> 34:17.305
- Jealous? No, no.
- Who is he, anyway?

34:18.265 --> 34:19.641
I don't know.

34:20.308 --> 34:21.851
Probably a good friend, I expect.

34:21.977 --> 34:24.729
Looks a bit more than a friend to me.

34:24.854 --> 34:27.065
Yes, well, I wouldn't
know about that.

34:27.857 --> 34:29.818
I think you were spying on them.

34:31.361 --> 34:34.030
And what makes you think that, then?

34:34.322 --> 34:35.574
Intuition.

34:40.036 --> 34:41.705
Oh! Oh, dear!

34:41.830 --> 34:44.666
Oh! Oh! Oh!

34:45.000 --> 34:47.127
Quick! Grab hold of this.

34:47.252 --> 34:49.546
Thank you very much.
I've just wet my trousers, haven't I?

34:51.381 --> 34:55.343
Clarissa: Oh, goodness! Oh! Oh!

34:55.552 --> 34:58.805
Clarissa: Don't worry,
no-one can see us here.

34:58.888 --> 35:00.724
Bob: Mmm, Clarissa...

35:00.849 --> 35:02.809
Clarissa: Oh, judd...

35:45.810 --> 35:47.479
Man: In! Out!

35:48.021 --> 35:49.731
In! Out!

35:50.607 --> 35:52.359
In! Out!

35:52.942 --> 35:55.612
Put your backs into it!

35:56.279 --> 35:58.031
In! Out!

35:58.490 --> 36:00.241
In! Out!

36:01.785 --> 36:03.578
In! Out!

36:04.329 --> 36:06.081
In! Out!

36:06.456 --> 36:08.208
In! Out!

36:08.667 --> 36:10.418
In! Out!

36:11.586 --> 36:13.338
In! Out!

36:14.005 --> 36:15.757
In! Out!

36:53.712 --> 36:55.213
Derek: Idiot!

36:55.296 --> 36:57.340
What the devil does he think
he's playing at?

36:57.507 --> 36:59.676
Doesn't look very good, does it?

37:00.135 --> 37:02.595
What the hell's Blake gonna say
when he finds out?

37:02.762 --> 37:04.639
You can see everything.

37:04.931 --> 37:06.266
I knew it.

37:06.433 --> 37:08.351
He's just gonna get himself
in deeper and deeper

37:08.476 --> 37:11.020
until he doesn't know
where he's at.

37:12.397 --> 37:14.107
She's quite pretty, I suppose.

37:14.232 --> 37:16.359
If you like that sort of thing.

37:16.484 --> 37:18.129
We'll have to go down there
first thing in the morning

37:18.153 --> 37:20.238
and make sure he doesn't get into
any more trouble.

38:10.330 --> 38:11.623
What are you doing here?

38:11.790 --> 38:14.292
Um...
Just admiring the decorations.

38:14.375 --> 38:16.252
It's a lovely place you've got here.

38:16.377 --> 38:19.172
I foresaw a death in my tea leaves.

38:19.297 --> 38:22.300
Someone is about to die.
I can sense it.

38:40.693 --> 38:43.404
- What are you doing here?
- Oh, I'm sorry.

38:43.530 --> 38:46.574
There's people popping up
and disappearing all over the place.

38:46.658 --> 38:49.160
You know, I suspect there's
a secret panel here somewhere.

38:49.285 --> 38:51.621
There are, lots of them.

38:53.039 --> 38:55.291
Have you found out
who it is yet?

38:55.416 --> 38:57.502
No. I'm just searching
for some clues.

38:57.627 --> 39:01.297
But don't worry, as soon as
I find some, I'll know who it is.

39:01.422 --> 39:03.007
Look, um...

39:03.758 --> 39:06.469
I was thinking, you know, er...

39:06.594 --> 39:08.638
Later on tonight...
I don't suppose, er...

39:08.721 --> 39:10.431
You, er... fancy a quick one...

39:10.557 --> 39:14.477
I mean, if you're nervous
about sleeping alone,

39:14.602 --> 39:16.187
I don't mind...

39:16.354 --> 39:18.398
That's all right.
I always lock my door.

39:18.481 --> 39:19.834
- You always lock your door?
- Mm-hmm.

39:19.858 --> 39:21.192
Very wise.

39:21.276 --> 39:23.278
Good night, judd.

39:23.444 --> 39:25.905
If I were you,
I'd lock yours, too.

40:49.072 --> 40:50.907
Can I help you, sir?

40:51.032 --> 40:52.200
Pardon?

40:53.201 --> 40:55.870
- Oh!
- Can I help you, sir?

40:56.704 --> 40:59.332
That, er...
That big bird, it's, er...

40:59.415 --> 41:01.084
Very interesting.

41:02.752 --> 41:05.088
The grimsdyke vulture, sir.

41:06.923 --> 41:08.841
Yeah, yeah.

41:10.426 --> 41:11.594
Who's the, er...

41:11.678 --> 41:13.846
Who's the fellow
in the chain mail?

41:14.013 --> 41:16.015
Marmaduke grimsdyke.

41:16.516 --> 41:19.727
We don't talk about him, sir.

42:16.743 --> 42:19.495
I don't know why you made me
come all the way out here.

42:19.620 --> 42:21.998
Why couldn't you have
come to the hotel?

42:22.123 --> 42:24.803
Are you just going to stand there
or are you going to give it to me?

42:33.718 --> 42:35.845
Hello, there!

42:53.279 --> 42:55.239
Hello, Percy!

42:55.323 --> 42:56.783
Been a good boy, then?

43:39.367 --> 43:40.618
What... what's happened?

43:40.701 --> 43:42.596
It was an accident.
I fell on top of him. He's out cold.

43:42.620 --> 43:44.460
- Have you got any smelling salts?
- Who is it?

43:44.539 --> 43:48.292
Oh! It's Scott.
Whatever's he doing here?

43:48.417 --> 43:49.919
He's not breathing.

43:50.002 --> 43:52.171
Oh, my god, I've killed him.

43:52.296 --> 43:54.924
- He's been shot.
- It was an accident, I fell on top of him. I...

43:55.049 --> 43:56.968
- He's been what?
- Look.

43:58.970 --> 44:02.431
Look, the thing to do is to keep
perfectly calm and not panic.

44:02.557 --> 44:04.058
So don't panic. Don't panic!

44:04.142 --> 44:05.262
Let's go and get the police.

44:05.309 --> 44:07.669
I'll phone the police,
and then we'll go and get the police.

44:07.770 --> 44:09.730
No. No, no. No, wait!

44:11.357 --> 44:13.109
- Will you wait?
- What?

44:13.234 --> 44:16.195
Obviously, it isn't an accident.

44:16.320 --> 44:18.364
- What, you mean he's been murdered?
- Yes.

44:18.531 --> 44:20.074
Oh, my god.

44:20.449 --> 44:21.659
Listen.

44:21.742 --> 44:22.970
What do you phone for the police?

44:22.994 --> 44:24.638
Christ, it's on the tip of my tongue.
What is it?

44:24.662 --> 44:26.873
- I mean...
- Just wait. Will you just wait?

44:27.039 --> 44:28.517
Yeah, but you don't understand.
He's been murdered!

44:28.541 --> 44:30.918
I know.
But if you stop rushing into things,

44:31.002 --> 44:32.753
and let me think clearly.

44:32.879 --> 44:35.298
Think clearly. Yes, that's very good.
Think clearly. Think...

44:35.423 --> 44:37.383
999. That's what it is.
I knew it was something...

44:37.550 --> 44:42.013
Oh, before you do anything,
just sit down and let me think.

44:42.138 --> 44:43.472
Look_.

44:44.599 --> 44:46.684
If he was shot outside,
we'd have heard it. Right?

44:46.767 --> 44:48.519
- Right.
- Right!

44:48.603 --> 44:50.479
Therefore, he must have...

44:50.563 --> 44:51.898
Crawled there,

44:53.608 --> 44:56.736
or been placed there by somebody.

44:56.819 --> 44:58.905
For what possible reason?

45:01.032 --> 45:03.117
Don't you see?

45:04.243 --> 45:06.412
To incriminate me.

45:06.537 --> 45:11.292
That's exactly the kind of scandal
that everybody was waiting for.

45:11.417 --> 45:13.127
- We'll have to hide it.
- What?!

45:13.252 --> 45:14.879
Will you shut up?

45:15.004 --> 45:19.133
If we can just delay him
being found for a few days,

45:19.217 --> 45:22.261
until the estate is mine.

45:22.386 --> 45:24.472
After that, it doesn't matter.

45:24.597 --> 45:28.935
- You can't do that.
- Oh, judd, darling.

45:29.018 --> 45:31.103
That is the answer.

45:31.270 --> 45:32.897
What about the police?

45:32.980 --> 45:35.274
I mean, you can't just go around
hiding dead bodies.

45:35.399 --> 45:37.610
You know, there's a law against
that sort of thing.

45:37.777 --> 45:40.529
Nobody will ever know.

45:40.655 --> 45:43.199
There's a quarry not far from here.

45:43.324 --> 45:45.159
He wouldn't be found for days.

45:45.284 --> 45:46.661
No, I'm sorry, Laura.

45:46.744 --> 45:49.705
Absolutely, definitely,
emphatically "no".

45:51.123 --> 45:55.169
But what we're really doing is
helping the police.

45:55.294 --> 45:56.337
Are we?

45:56.420 --> 45:58.714
Well, Scott wasn't murdered here.

45:58.798 --> 46:00.508
He was murdered somewhere else,

46:00.591 --> 46:02.760
so, by us moving the body,

46:02.843 --> 46:04.804
we're stopping the police
from being confused.

46:04.971 --> 46:07.074
I don't think they'll see it
quite like that, somehow.

46:07.098 --> 46:08.266
Especially if they find out.

46:15.815 --> 46:17.316
Good evening, craddock.

46:17.400 --> 46:19.443
Good night, madam.

46:23.072 --> 46:26.158
As soon as it's light,
you can get rid of it properly.

46:26.284 --> 46:28.202
What do you mean,
"as soon as it's light"?

46:28.327 --> 46:30.121
Well, it's going to
look suspicious if you

46:30.204 --> 46:33.040
try and get rid of it
in the middle of the night.

46:33.165 --> 46:36.210
Oh, judd, you don't know
what this means to me.

46:36.335 --> 46:38.129
About...

46:38.296 --> 46:41.549
About ten years, I should think,
if they find out.

46:41.632 --> 46:42.883
Come on.

47:46.489 --> 47:48.699
- Morning, sir.
- Morning.

47:48.824 --> 47:50.576
I shouldn't think
you can see much behind

47:50.618 --> 47:52.745
with that on the back.

47:53.621 --> 47:55.498
Well, I... I saw you.

47:57.500 --> 48:02.296
It's contrary to the motor vehicles
construction and use regulations,

48:02.380 --> 48:05.549
section 40, sub-paragraph 5,

48:05.674 --> 48:08.177
road traffic act 1972.

48:08.260 --> 48:11.263
Yeah, well, I'm sorry, officer,
I didn't realise that I was, er...

48:11.430 --> 48:12.890
Contravening...

48:14.225 --> 48:16.227
Where's your spare wheel?

48:16.727 --> 48:19.105
Well, it's in the back,
isuppose.

48:19.230 --> 48:21.107
- Why?
- You're gonna need it.

48:21.232 --> 48:22.817
You got a flat tyre.

48:25.778 --> 48:28.239
Right, sir, if you'd care
to get out of the car,

48:28.322 --> 48:29.990
I'll give you a hand.

48:30.116 --> 48:32.010
- It shouldn't take long.
- That's all right, officer.

48:32.034 --> 48:34.370
Actually, I can manage on my own.
It's going to be okay.

48:34.495 --> 48:37.706
In spite of what the public thinks,
we do like to help sometimes.

48:37.873 --> 48:39.417
Now you're gonna
need a hand with this,

48:39.500 --> 48:41.877
otherwise you'll
never get the wheel out.

48:43.879 --> 48:46.173
Right, if you'd like to
take the other end.

48:46.257 --> 48:48.175
Ready? One, two, three, hup!

48:49.802 --> 48:53.097
What have you got in here, then?
A body?

49:00.521 --> 49:03.232
It's all right, actually,
thank you, officer.

49:03.315 --> 49:05.317
I can manage very well now.
Thank you very much.

49:05.443 --> 49:08.070
- Thank you.
- Oh, all right, then. Bye.

49:23.461 --> 49:24.837
Did, er...

49:24.920 --> 49:26.338
I leave my gloves here?

49:26.422 --> 49:28.716
Oh! There they are.

49:42.521 --> 49:44.857
Woman: Having a spot of bother?

49:47.151 --> 49:48.611
Yes.

49:49.570 --> 49:51.530
I thought you were.

49:54.283 --> 49:55.576
I'm Sally.

49:55.784 --> 49:57.495
I'm a housewife.

49:59.121 --> 50:00.039
Really?

50:00.122 --> 50:03.000
Rather boring, really,
being a housewife.

50:07.254 --> 50:09.423
Would you like a cup of tea?

50:10.841 --> 50:12.301
No, thank you.

50:25.648 --> 50:28.400
Would you like to
wash your hands?

50:28.526 --> 50:30.861
Well, yes, I wouldn't mind actually.
Thanks very much.

50:32.404 --> 50:35.616
Sally:
I did enjoy our little chat outside.

50:35.658 --> 50:37.576
It was really interesting.

50:38.661 --> 50:40.204
Fascinating.

50:40.329 --> 50:42.831
That's how you get to
know people, isn't it?

50:42.915 --> 50:44.416
By chatting.

50:46.919 --> 50:48.128
Have you, er...

50:48.212 --> 50:50.798
- Have you got a towel?
- Pink or blue?

50:50.923 --> 50:53.801
- Well, I'm easy.
- I thought you might be.

50:54.802 --> 50:57.096
You've got that look about you.

51:23.080 --> 51:24.999
I knew you'd be
just game for anything

51:25.082 --> 51:27.209
the moment I saw you out there.

51:27.334 --> 51:29.378
No, no. I didn't mean that...

51:29.503 --> 51:31.088
Does it do things for you?

51:31.171 --> 51:33.549
I see all the sex films, you know.

51:33.674 --> 51:35.926
Hot lust and sweaty thighs.

51:36.010 --> 51:37.344
Nuns in rubber.

51:37.553 --> 51:40.848
Now look, I mean, I didn't...
I just... I thought that...

51:40.973 --> 51:43.767
Well, ordinary sex
gets so boring, doesn't it?

51:43.892 --> 51:47.396
Especially with Frederick.
He's my husband.

51:47.521 --> 51:50.733
He's got no imagination.
Not like the milkman.

51:50.816 --> 51:54.653
You'd be amazed what he gets up to
with his extra pinta.

52:00.576 --> 52:02.786
Then it's into the high heel boots
and gestapo uniform

52:02.953 --> 52:06.373
for a quick bit of the night Porter
with the gasman.

52:11.420 --> 52:12.504
Got it?

52:14.923 --> 52:17.176
How about
a bit of last tango in Paris?

52:17.301 --> 52:20.012
- I've got loads of butter in the fridge.
- Oh, Christ.

52:23.474 --> 52:24.892
I would have suggested deep throat,

52:25.017 --> 52:27.787
but I tried it with the window cleaner
last week and nearly choked myself.

52:27.811 --> 52:30.189
Look, love. I only came in here
to get me hands washed.

52:30.314 --> 52:32.816
Oh! I love it
when they play hard to get.

52:32.941 --> 52:34.485
Leave it out!

52:50.626 --> 52:53.337
- Lost it?
- It was an accident.

52:53.420 --> 52:54.880
Lost it? How could you?

52:54.963 --> 52:57.049
Well, I just turned my back
for a second, that's all,

52:57.132 --> 52:58.258
and then it was gone.

52:58.384 --> 53:01.887
- Look, I was washing my hands.
- Washing your hands?

53:02.054 --> 53:04.515
Look, I had to
change the wheel, didn't I?

53:04.598 --> 53:06.016
And then this woman came out.

53:06.141 --> 53:07.518
But that was after the...

53:07.601 --> 53:08.811
The policeman pulled me up.

53:08.936 --> 53:11.855
Well, he didn't exactly pull me up.
But he wanted to change the wheel,

53:11.939 --> 53:14.793
I had to help him, otherwise it would
have looked suspicious, wouldn't it?

53:14.817 --> 53:16.777
I had to and I did.

53:16.860 --> 53:20.114
And then this funny woman came out
with kinky black leather boots, whip...

53:20.239 --> 53:22.199
The trunk! Where is it?

53:23.742 --> 53:24.868
Oh!

53:26.662 --> 53:29.456
Oh, no. What are you two
doing down here?

53:29.540 --> 53:31.417
Why? What have you done now?

53:35.462 --> 53:36.714
I don't believe it.

53:36.797 --> 53:39.550
I just do not believe it.
Even you couldn't be that stupid.

53:39.675 --> 53:41.069
All right, all right.
I'll admit there's been

53:41.093 --> 53:43.429
a slight error ofjudgement
on my part, but...

53:43.554 --> 53:47.349
"Error of..."! Do you realise
what you've got yourself into?

53:47.474 --> 53:49.452
Following somebody about
with binoculars is one thing,

53:49.476 --> 53:51.103
but murder?

53:51.270 --> 53:52.706
You've really landed
yourself in it this time.

53:52.730 --> 53:54.457
Well, it's no good
you keep going on about it.

53:54.481 --> 53:56.692
I mean,
I didn't murder him, did I?

53:56.817 --> 53:59.903
I'll admit that things haven't gone
quite as I'd liked them to, but...

54:00.070 --> 54:02.489
There's no talking to him.
I give up. I just give up.

54:02.656 --> 54:05.367
Oh, I'm sure he was
only trying to help.

54:05.492 --> 54:07.345
I told you not to take
this case in the first place,

54:07.369 --> 54:08.912
but you wouldn't listen to me.

54:08.996 --> 54:11.099
Yeah, but I've solved it.
I mean, I know who murdered him.

54:11.123 --> 54:13.959
It's just a... just a question
of proving it, that's all.

54:14.126 --> 54:15.812
What do you mean,
you know who murdered him?

54:15.836 --> 54:17.379
I do. His accomplice.

54:17.463 --> 54:19.798
Then why haven't you
told the police?

54:20.799 --> 54:23.153
Well, because I'm not quite sure
exactly who the accomplice is yet,

54:23.177 --> 54:25.721
- but I've got some suspects.
- Suspects.

54:25.846 --> 54:28.032
You wait until you see how strange
the Butler's been acting lately.

54:28.056 --> 54:31.018
What does that miss Sutton
have to say about it?

54:31.143 --> 54:32.746
Well, she reckons
the best thing to do now

54:32.770 --> 54:36.064
is just to try and solve the case
as quickly as possible.

54:37.149 --> 54:39.943
Listen, that trunk has probably
been opened already,

54:40.110 --> 54:41.337
and if it has,
it will be no time at all

54:41.361 --> 54:43.989
before it's traced back to this place.
So, you go to the police

54:44.114 --> 54:46.617
before they come to you,
and you tell them everything.

54:46.700 --> 54:48.577
I can't do that.
I promised Laura.

54:48.869 --> 54:51.955
Look, it's the only chance you've got
of getting yourself out of this mess,

54:52.080 --> 54:53.415
short of pleading insanity.

54:53.457 --> 54:55.477
No, on second thought,
that's probably your best chance.

54:55.501 --> 54:58.337
Look, if I tell the whole story,
Laura will inherit nothing.

54:58.420 --> 55:00.172
Well, so what?

55:00.297 --> 55:02.132
It's better than
being an accessory

55:02.216 --> 55:03.943
and going to prison
for the rest of your life.

55:03.967 --> 55:06.094
Maud: He's right, you know.

55:21.443 --> 55:25.030
- Woman: Is the plumber there?
- No, no. I'm sorry, he hasn't been here.

55:25.155 --> 55:27.741
- Do send him round.
- Yes, I'll tell him as soon as he comes.

55:27.950 --> 55:29.576
Goodbye, ma'am.

55:35.582 --> 55:37.960
The inspector, please.

55:38.085 --> 55:40.754
Oh, yes. You've come to
the wrong place. He's not here.

55:40.879 --> 55:43.173
- Pardon?
- No, I just had his wife on the phone.

55:43.257 --> 55:45.235
- Wondered what happened to you.
- What happened to me?

55:45.259 --> 55:48.512
- Yes. She expects you.
- Really?

55:49.638 --> 55:53.433
Yes. You'll find his house,
number 6, on the right.

55:53.517 --> 55:55.602
The one with the red door.

55:57.563 --> 56:00.023
Well, what are you waiting for?

56:00.190 --> 56:03.777
- The one with the red door?
- The one with the red door.

56:19.251 --> 56:22.004
Thank goodness you're here.
I was getting quite desperate.

56:22.170 --> 56:24.172
- Do come in.
- Thank you.

56:24.298 --> 56:25.924
The kitchen's at the back.

56:26.049 --> 56:29.344
I tried to do it myself,
but it wasn't really very satisfactory.

56:29.553 --> 56:32.180
What I really needed was
a nice long tool

56:32.264 --> 56:34.184
to poke it with properly,
if you see what I mean.

56:34.224 --> 56:35.851
I hunted about for hours,

56:35.976 --> 56:38.020
but I couldn't find
anything satisfactory.

56:38.145 --> 56:41.523
Finally, I decided the only thing to do
is to get a man round instead.

56:41.648 --> 56:45.277
- Yes, well, actually, I've come to...
- Solve my little problem. Yes, I know.

56:45.360 --> 56:47.905
I do hope you've got
the right equipment for it.

56:48.071 --> 56:50.240
It's probably just tea leaves.

56:50.407 --> 56:52.534
Oh, no, no.
You've got it wrong. I'm not...

56:52.618 --> 56:54.077
Quite sure what it is.

56:54.161 --> 56:56.914
- Oh, I do understand, mr, um...
- West.

56:57.039 --> 56:58.457
You see...

56:58.540 --> 56:59.860
Well, everyone thinks it's Blake.

56:59.958 --> 57:02.753
How strange. "Blake" doesn't
sound a bit like "west".

57:02.920 --> 57:07.758
I suppose you'll probably try
to suck it out with your little plunger.

57:07.883 --> 57:09.509
Drink?

57:12.888 --> 57:15.265
- Woman: Say when.
- Bob: When.

57:15.849 --> 57:17.643
- What?
- When.

57:21.480 --> 57:25.484
My goodness, you certainly
like your drink, don't you?

57:25.609 --> 57:27.945
But I like a man
who's not afraid to admit it.

57:28.111 --> 57:30.030
Listen. When I came round,

57:30.197 --> 57:33.116
I thought your husband
was gonna be here.

57:33.241 --> 57:35.661
Oh, he won't be home
for ages yet.

57:36.328 --> 57:38.538
Why don't you come and sit down?

57:39.957 --> 57:41.166
Cheers.

57:44.795 --> 57:46.129
Cheers.

57:46.880 --> 57:48.757
Is it getting hard?

57:50.342 --> 57:51.510
Pardon?

57:51.677 --> 57:53.011
Finding work?

57:53.136 --> 57:55.180
Oh, yeah, well...

57:56.682 --> 57:59.476
Look, are you sure
aboutyourhusband?

57:59.559 --> 58:00.559
Positive.

58:00.644 --> 58:03.981
- He is the inspector?
- Yes.

58:04.606 --> 58:07.859
And he's a very difficult man
to live with, I can tell you.

58:07.985 --> 58:09.194
Oh, really?

58:09.277 --> 58:12.406
I don't want you
to get the wrong idea,

58:12.531 --> 58:13.782
but I get the kind of feeling

58:13.865 --> 58:17.119
that you're the sort of man
I could really depend on.

58:17.244 --> 58:19.413
But, um...

58:19.496 --> 58:21.039
What about the husband?

58:21.123 --> 58:24.501
Oh, he won't be back for ages yet.

58:24.626 --> 58:26.336
Plenty of time.

58:34.511 --> 58:35.762
Mummy!

58:41.560 --> 58:42.853
Mummy!

58:55.115 --> 58:57.325
Mum! Mummy!

58:57.451 --> 58:59.661
What are you doing?

58:59.828 --> 59:02.122
Mummy's just having a little chat
with the plumber.

59:02.247 --> 59:04.249
Why are you lying down?

59:05.709 --> 59:08.253
Don't ask silly questions.
Do as I told you and go to bed.

59:09.629 --> 59:11.757
I'll go.

59:11.882 --> 59:15.135
- Where did he come from?
- Upstairs. My god.

59:18.638 --> 59:19.806
Quick!

59:24.436 --> 59:26.396
Woman: Hello, Willy.
Is your mummy in?

59:26.521 --> 59:29.066
Willy: Yes.
She's with the plumber.

59:31.985 --> 59:34.863
Oh, mrs grimpton.
What a lovely surprise.

59:35.072 --> 59:38.658
- I do hope I'm not interrupting anything.
- Oh, no.

59:38.784 --> 59:41.995
Why were you jumping up and down
on top of mummy?

59:42.120 --> 59:45.665
Willy, dear,
it's way past your bedtime.

59:55.842 --> 59:57.177
Willy: Daddy!

59:57.260 --> 1:00:00.138
Hello, hello, little man.
Want to come up?

1:00:00.305 --> 1:00:02.849
There, what a big Willy I've got.

1:00:04.601 --> 1:00:06.686
Hello, hello, hello.
What's going on here, then?

1:00:06.812 --> 1:00:08.563
Darling, you're home early.

1:00:08.688 --> 1:00:10.792
I just popped in to tell you
I'm working late tonight.

1:00:10.816 --> 1:00:12.776
That missing person
business at the hotel.

1:00:12.818 --> 1:00:14.569
Turned out nasty, I'm afraid.

1:00:14.736 --> 1:00:17.155
Afternoon, mrs grimpton.
How's the reverend?

1:00:17.280 --> 1:00:19.074
Bearing up, as usual.

1:00:19.199 --> 1:00:21.618
Daddy, why don't plumbers
wear any trousers?

1:00:21.743 --> 1:00:26.289
Darling, that's the plumber.
He's just come to unblock the sink.

1:00:26.414 --> 1:00:27.749
Plumber?

1:00:27.833 --> 1:00:29.960
- Local, are you?
- Er...

1:00:30.085 --> 1:00:32.504
Why has he put
his trousers back on, daddy?

1:00:32.671 --> 1:00:35.757
Does that mean he's not going to
jump up and down any more?

1:00:35.882 --> 1:00:38.260
Excuse me, mate.
This where the blockage is?

1:00:38.385 --> 1:00:39.553
Crikey. Is that the time?

1:00:39.636 --> 1:00:41.196
Well, I'll just have to
be running along

1:00:41.221 --> 1:00:44.850
because I've got a few
more appointments to... to...

1:00:44.933 --> 1:00:48.061
And then the real plumber came in,

1:00:48.145 --> 1:00:49.312
and it bec...

1:00:49.396 --> 1:00:52.691
Somebody just put this
underneath my bedroom door.

1:00:53.608 --> 1:00:57.112
"The burlesque club.
Table five, ten o'clock sharp.

1:00:57.237 --> 1:01:00.198
"Bring the money in used notes."

1:01:00.323 --> 1:01:04.077
Yes, well, that's where he's made
his final mistake, isn't it?

1:01:04.202 --> 1:01:05.871
What final mistake?

1:01:06.037 --> 1:01:08.237
Well, I give him the money,
he hands over the negatives,

1:01:08.290 --> 1:01:10.500
- and then I nab him.
- You nab him?

1:01:10.584 --> 1:01:12.311
Yeah. I'll just wait for him
to expose himself,

1:01:12.335 --> 1:01:13.753
and then I'll pinch him.

1:01:13.879 --> 1:01:15.439
Well, as long as
he doesn't get sidetracked,

1:01:15.463 --> 1:01:16.823
like some people we could mention.

1:01:16.882 --> 1:01:19.217
All I want to know is, where
am I going to get 50,000 from?

1:01:19.384 --> 1:01:21.303
Don't you worry, love.

1:01:21.511 --> 1:01:24.306
I know exactly
how these things are done.

1:01:25.140 --> 1:01:27.100
Laura: Do you really think
that's gonna work?

1:01:27.225 --> 1:01:28.518
Never fails.

1:01:28.643 --> 1:01:32.522
See, you just put the proper money
at the top and it all looks real.

1:01:32.647 --> 1:01:34.399
I wonder who it's gonna
turn out to be?

1:01:34.482 --> 1:01:36.985
The Butler.
That's who did it, the Butler.

1:01:37.110 --> 1:01:38.403
How do you work that one out?

1:01:38.528 --> 1:01:40.238
Well, call it a hunch, if you like.

1:01:40.363 --> 1:01:43.241
- Call it a wild guess.
- You'll see.

1:01:43.408 --> 1:01:46.077
Look, I didn't like to
voice my suspicions beforehand,

1:01:46.203 --> 1:01:48.288
but tonight,
after he turns up at that club,

1:01:48.371 --> 1:01:49.831
I'll have all the proof I need.

1:01:49.956 --> 1:01:51.791
You'd better.
Otherwise I'm in trouble.

1:01:51.875 --> 1:01:53.501
Don't worry.

1:01:53.668 --> 1:01:55.754
It'll be the Butler.
He's the blackmailer.

1:01:55.921 --> 1:01:57.756
He's also a murderer.

1:01:58.590 --> 1:02:00.634
Yeah, well, don't worry.

1:02:01.301 --> 1:02:03.929
I know how to look after myself.

1:02:34.960 --> 1:02:38.296
Violet: You know, I don't think
this is such a good idea.

1:02:38.380 --> 1:02:40.548
These sort of things
always make me feel so nervous.

1:02:40.715 --> 1:02:42.926
Medea: Father would wish us
to speak with him.

1:02:43.009 --> 1:02:46.596
Sydney: I don't understand why.
He had no time for you while he was alive.

1:02:46.721 --> 1:02:48.556
What are you lot doing now?

1:02:48.640 --> 1:02:50.684
We're going to have a séance.

1:02:50.809 --> 1:02:53.228
Where's judd?
Maybe he'd like to join us.

1:02:53.395 --> 1:02:55.939
Oh, he, er...
He went to visit someone in town.

1:02:56.064 --> 1:02:58.900
- You'll be joining us though, won't you?
- Oh, no, I don't think so.

1:02:59.025 --> 1:03:03.029
I think father's going to be very upset
if you don't have a word with him.

1:03:03.154 --> 1:03:07.284
Listen, birdie, if I've got to sit through
this blasted nonsense, you can as well.

1:03:07.409 --> 1:03:10.203
- Cloth!
- Yes. Well, this is nice, isn't it?

1:03:10.328 --> 1:03:13.748
- I always did like having my fortune told.
- Lights!

1:03:20.839 --> 1:03:25.969
Now if we all place our index finger
very lightly on top of the glass.

1:03:28.638 --> 1:03:30.849
We are having a séance,
round we all sit.

1:03:30.932 --> 1:03:33.601
If you want my opinion,
it's a right load of...

1:03:41.443 --> 1:03:45.447
Everyone place their hands
gently on the table,

1:03:45.572 --> 1:03:48.533
fingers lightly touching.

1:03:53.413 --> 1:03:55.498
What was that?

1:03:55.623 --> 1:03:59.294
- Is there anybody there?
- My god!

1:04:04.299 --> 1:04:07.302
Who is it? Speak! Speak!

1:04:09.554 --> 1:04:13.224
Who's there? Speak! Speak!

1:04:17.520 --> 1:04:19.481
I... I need a bloody drink.

1:04:21.524 --> 1:04:24.402
Someone touched me! Oh!

1:04:25.111 --> 1:04:27.864
Yes, yes. There's definitely
someone in the room.

1:04:27.989 --> 1:04:29.616
I can feel it. I can feel it.

1:04:29.741 --> 1:04:33.036
Father, father, is it you?

1:04:33.161 --> 1:04:35.121
Oh, my god. Supposing it's...

1:04:35.205 --> 1:04:36.539
Marmaduke grimsdyke?

1:04:36.664 --> 1:04:39.376
Marmaduke, if it is thou,
be gone, I say!

1:04:39.542 --> 1:04:41.086
Marmaduke, piss off.

1:04:41.211 --> 1:04:43.630
Who is it? Answer me, father.

1:04:43.713 --> 1:04:45.715
If it is you, then answer me.

1:04:45.882 --> 1:04:48.551
One knock for yes.

1:04:48.676 --> 1:04:51.388
Two knocks for no.

1:04:54.641 --> 1:04:58.144
Medea: One knock for yes,
two knocks for no.

1:04:59.562 --> 1:05:03.108
Who is it? Speak! Speak!
Who is it?

1:05:03.608 --> 1:05:06.528
Craddock: It's only me, madam.
Inspector hogg to see you.

1:05:06.694 --> 1:05:09.423
Sorry to disturb you like this.
Just a few routine enquiries, that's all,

1:05:09.447 --> 1:05:11.408
in connection with
a mr Scott radleigh.

1:05:11.491 --> 1:05:13.135
I believe he called here
yesterday morning.

1:05:13.159 --> 1:05:15.203
Wasn't that the fellow
who came to see Laura?

1:05:15.328 --> 1:05:17.497
Nothing that might
create a scandal, I hope.

1:05:17.622 --> 1:05:19.290
- You knew him, did you?
- Well, er...

1:05:19.374 --> 1:05:22.127
Slightly, from when I was a model.

1:05:22.293 --> 1:05:23.461
I see.

1:05:23.628 --> 1:05:26.131
Are you also acquainted
with a mr and mrs boodle

1:05:26.256 --> 1:05:28.925
- of 36 abersham Crescent, reading?
- Oh, no.

1:05:29.050 --> 1:05:30.969
They moved there yesterday.

1:05:31.052 --> 1:05:32.488
But what's that
got to do with Scott?

1:05:32.512 --> 1:05:34.806
He fell out of a trunk
while they were unpacking.

1:05:34.931 --> 1:05:37.016
I'm sorry to have to tell you,
he'd been shot.

1:05:37.100 --> 1:05:40.270
- Shot?
- Surely you don't suspect miss Sutton, sir?

1:05:40.395 --> 1:05:43.898
- Think of the scandal.
- Just a few routine enquiries, that's all.

1:05:44.023 --> 1:05:46.401
- I saw it. I saw it all.
- You witnessed it?

1:05:46.526 --> 1:05:50.238
In the tea leaves.
The curse of the grimsdyke vulture.

1:05:53.366 --> 1:05:56.453
I think I'm going to have
a nervous breakdown.

1:05:57.495 --> 1:05:58.913
Good heavens.

1:05:58.997 --> 1:06:01.291
What's that plumber
doing under the table?

1:06:02.625 --> 1:06:03.960
He's not a plumber.

1:06:04.502 --> 1:06:05.712
He's a bird watcher.

1:06:05.837 --> 1:06:08.423
Well, he wouldn't
find any under there.

1:06:08.590 --> 1:06:12.260
If I could have a word with you
in private, please, inspector?

1:06:12.343 --> 1:06:13.678
Please.

1:06:15.221 --> 1:06:17.098
He was the first to die.

1:06:17.182 --> 1:06:18.725
There will be more.

1:06:18.850 --> 1:06:21.352
The tea leaves never lie.

1:06:22.812 --> 1:06:25.398
So, you see, inspector,
I'm not a plumber,

1:06:25.482 --> 1:06:27.484
nor am I a bird watcher.

1:06:27.609 --> 1:06:29.628
I'm a private detective,
and I'm down here on a case

1:06:29.652 --> 1:06:31.821
and I just didn't want anybody
to find out, that's all.

1:06:31.988 --> 1:06:34.532
So, what were you doing
at my house with my wife?

1:06:34.616 --> 1:06:37.660
Well... well, I felt that I should
let you know who I was,

1:06:37.785 --> 1:06:40.014
what I was doing down here,
just in case you were wondering.

1:06:40.038 --> 1:06:42.749
I see. Nothing to do with
this Scott radleigh business?

1:06:42.874 --> 1:06:46.336
Oh, no, no, no. I'm just down here
checking up on somebody, that's all.

1:06:46.419 --> 1:06:48.004
Now you just watch your step.

1:06:48.087 --> 1:06:50.256
I don't like private detectives,
neverhave.

1:06:50.340 --> 1:06:53.259
- Bloody amateurs.
- Yeah.

1:06:53.384 --> 1:06:54.820
Well, if I can be of any assistance...

1:06:54.844 --> 1:06:59.140
You just keep your nose out of it,
or you and me will fall out.

1:06:59.390 --> 1:07:00.951
Right, now, if you'll excuse me,
I rather think

1:07:00.975 --> 1:07:03.228
I'd better be getting along,
don't you?

1:07:03.353 --> 1:07:06.981
- Do you mind if I ask you a question?
- No.

1:07:07.273 --> 1:07:09.692
What were you doing
jumping up and down?

1:07:10.777 --> 1:07:12.362
Oh, it was, er...

1:07:12.445 --> 1:07:14.781
It was cramp.
I get terrible cramp.

1:07:15.782 --> 1:07:18.618
You have to keep moving with it,
you see, otherwise...

1:07:18.743 --> 1:07:19.743
Cramp?

1:07:20.370 --> 1:07:23.248
Hello, wilfred crimble.
Press. My card.

1:07:23.373 --> 1:07:24.707
- What?
- My card.

1:07:24.832 --> 1:07:27.502
- Look, who let you in here?
- Good murder, this, innit?

1:07:27.669 --> 1:07:30.296
- Fancy giving us an exclusive?
- Certainly not. Now shove off.

1:07:30.380 --> 1:07:34.008
Not about how you're actually
a private detective.

1:07:34.133 --> 1:07:36.010
How did you know that?

1:07:36.135 --> 1:07:38.489
I overheard your conversation
with inspector hogg over there.

1:07:38.513 --> 1:07:39.514
What's going on here?

1:07:39.639 --> 1:07:41.033
Derek, deal with him, will you?
I've got to go.

1:07:41.057 --> 1:07:45.019
Hello, crimble, press.
You one of the murder suspects?

1:07:45.228 --> 1:07:47.388
- Well...
- Care to say a few words, would you? Slowly.

1:07:47.480 --> 1:07:51.150
- Look".
- How well did you know the dead body?

1:07:52.610 --> 1:07:54.904
__"no

1:07:55.071 --> 1:07:57.740
- comment.
- "Comment."

1:08:15.174 --> 1:08:16.175
Man: Oi!

1:08:16.759 --> 1:08:18.803
Where do you think you're goin'?

1:08:18.928 --> 1:08:21.306
- Inside.
- You a member, are ya?

1:08:22.390 --> 1:08:23.600
Well, no, but, er...

1:08:23.683 --> 1:08:25.852
I'm supposed to be
meeting somebody here.

1:08:25.977 --> 1:08:28.521
- Who?
- Well, I'm not sure, exactly.

1:08:28.646 --> 1:08:30.231
What do you mean,
you're not sure?

1:08:30.356 --> 1:08:33.192
Well, I won't know who it is
until I get inside, if you...

1:08:33.318 --> 1:08:35.361
No, I don't, mate.

1:08:35.486 --> 1:08:37.506
Oh, there must be a reservation booked.
Table number five.

1:08:37.530 --> 1:08:38.698
Why?

1:08:38.823 --> 1:08:41.034
Because that's where
I'm gonna meet whoever it is.

1:08:41.159 --> 1:08:43.828
Table number five,
ten o'clock sharp.

1:08:44.829 --> 1:08:47.016
- Nothing here.
- Look, it's important that I get in there.

1:08:47.040 --> 1:08:50.001
- My name is... my name's judd Blake.
- Yeah?

1:08:51.336 --> 1:08:53.731
Well, no, it isn't, actually.
It's Bob west. But, the thing is...

1:08:53.755 --> 1:08:55.340
Look, I don't know
who you are, mate.

1:08:55.465 --> 1:08:57.151
You're not a member,
you ain't got a table booked,

1:08:57.175 --> 1:08:58.485
you dunno who you're
supposed to be meetin',

1:08:58.509 --> 1:08:59.802

1:08:59.927 --> 1:09:01.530
- Now, wait a minute. Look...
- I told ya...

1:09:01.554 --> 1:09:02.906
I've got to get in there.
It's very important.

1:09:02.930 --> 1:09:05.600
- I've got to deliver this case.
- What's important?

1:09:05.725 --> 1:09:07.810
All right, I'll level with ya.

1:09:09.270 --> 1:09:11.397
I'm a private detective.

1:09:11.522 --> 1:09:13.483
A private detective.

1:09:13.566 --> 1:09:15.860
Well, why didn't you
say so in the first place?

1:09:15.985 --> 1:09:18.363
'Course, that makes
all the difference.

1:09:52.355 --> 1:09:53.773
Who?

1:09:53.856 --> 1:09:55.441
Did he? Right.

1:10:45.658 --> 1:10:47.219
Announcer:
And now, ladies and gentlemen,

1:10:47.243 --> 1:10:48.643
the moment you've been waiting for.

1:10:48.745 --> 1:10:50.037
The star of our show,

1:10:50.121 --> 1:10:53.750
the fabulous miss Lisa Moroni.

1:10:57.462 --> 1:11:00.173
- You'll miss your cue.
- What? What?

1:11:08.556 --> 1:11:10.892
J“ I'm Moroni with an

1:11:28.493 --> 1:11:30.703
I thought we booked four girls?

1:11:31.120 --> 1:11:33.206
So who's the big ugly blonde?

1:11:33.915 --> 1:11:36.125
J“ lonely

1:11:36.250 --> 1:11:39.420
j“ so terribly lonely

1:11:40.296 --> 1:11:43.007
j“ like fromaggio

1:11:43.633 --> 1:11:46.844
j“ with no macaroni

1:11:46.969 --> 1:11:49.972
j“ so if a guy with a "y"
and a wherefore tries

1:11:50.056 --> 1:11:51.390
j“ to sample my salami

1:11:51.474 --> 1:11:53.351
j“ I'll wink with an eye
and please with these

1:11:53.434 --> 1:11:57.271
j“ Moroni
ain't that b-a-r-m-y, barmy? J“

1:11:57.980 --> 1:11:59.857
- hey, you.
- What?

1:11:59.982 --> 1:12:01.442
Er... nothing.

1:12:02.568 --> 1:12:05.404
Lisa: I mean... I mean, I'm just...
Well, I'm just...

1:12:05.488 --> 1:12:08.282
I'm just terrific.
I mean, you're terrific.

1:12:08.407 --> 1:12:11.577
Oh, if momma could only
see me now, right?

1:12:11.702 --> 1:12:14.247
Listen, er...
Now I'd like to do a song.

1:12:14.330 --> 1:12:17.917
It really means very much to me.
Like...

1:12:18.042 --> 1:12:20.253
Like being in the movies, or like...

1:12:20.336 --> 1:12:22.129
Like being here tonight.

1:12:22.255 --> 1:12:27.510
But, I want you to know,
this is my favourite song.

1:12:31.597 --> 1:12:35.518
J“ momma told me all about propriety

1:12:35.643 --> 1:12:38.688
j“ not getting stuck in a rut

1:12:38.813 --> 1:12:43.484
j“ but a girl's got to guard her integrity

1:12:44.402 --> 1:12:47.196
j“ so give me my diamonds uncut

1:12:47.321 --> 1:12:51.075
j“ and give me the real thing

1:12:51.200 --> 1:12:54.954
j“ make my pendulums swing

1:12:55.079 --> 1:12:58.291
j“ don't want no mail order thing

1:12:58.416 --> 1:13:01.836
j“ give me the r-e-a-I, real thing

1:13:01.961 --> 1:13:03.838
j“ real thing j“

1:13:08.134 --> 1:13:10.845
good evening, my dear.
Delighted to see you.

1:13:10.970 --> 1:13:13.139
What can I get you to drink?

1:13:14.432 --> 1:13:16.017
A pint of bitter.

1:13:16.142 --> 1:13:18.227
Pint of bitter
for a lovely little girl like you?

1:13:18.311 --> 1:13:19.538
You should be drinking champagne.

1:13:19.562 --> 1:13:23.816
Waiter, bring me a bottle of the
best champagne you have, will you?

1:13:24.734 --> 1:13:26.652
I am sir basil lemmington.

1:13:26.736 --> 1:13:29.822
Call me baz if you like,
it makes no difference to me.

1:13:29.989 --> 1:13:31.157
What's your name?

1:13:31.240 --> 1:13:33.993
Look, let's leave names
out of it, shall we?

1:13:34.118 --> 1:13:37.121
You coy little temptress, you!

1:13:37.246 --> 1:13:41.834
Pardon my asking, but you have
the most delightful set of knockers.

1:13:42.001 --> 1:13:44.003
Or have you?
I can't see from here.

1:13:44.128 --> 1:13:47.715
Come here and let me
have a better look.

1:13:47.840 --> 1:13:51.719
Lisa:
J“ they live life the nouveau riche way

1:13:51.844 --> 1:13:55.473
j“ you know all I need is a roof and a bed

1:13:55.598 --> 1:13:59.101
j“ as long as it's in Saint-tropez

1:13:59.268 --> 1:14:02.605
j“ give me the real thing, come on

1:14:02.730 --> 1:14:06.025
j“ and make my pendulums swing j“

1:14:06.192 --> 1:14:08.712
look, let's stop fooling around
and get down to business, shall we?

1:14:08.736 --> 1:14:11.989
- How much?
- £50,000.

1:14:12.114 --> 1:14:16.202
Fifty thousand?
It's a bit pricey, isn't it?

1:14:16.327 --> 1:14:18.120
I've never paid more than forty.

1:14:18.204 --> 1:14:20.581
All right, all right, forty.
Let's not quibble.

1:14:20.748 --> 1:14:23.000
The thing is, how do I know
you've got the goods?

1:14:23.125 --> 1:14:24.752
I beg your pardon?

1:14:24.877 --> 1:14:26.730
Well, you don't think I'm going to
give you what you want

1:14:26.754 --> 1:14:28.148
without seeing
what you've got, do you?

1:14:28.172 --> 1:14:30.967
You don't think I'm gonna get it
out here and show you, do you?

1:14:31.050 --> 1:14:32.969
Well, there might
be something missing.

1:14:33.094 --> 1:14:34.220
There wasn't this morning.

1:14:34.303 --> 1:14:36.055
Yes, but how am I
supposed to know that?

1:14:36.180 --> 1:14:37.532
What kind of a sucker
do you take me for?

1:14:37.556 --> 1:14:40.559
Anyway, I'm not doing anything
until I've seen what you've got.

1:14:41.352 --> 1:14:44.105
J“ don't want no mail order thing

1:14:44.313 --> 1:14:47.650
j“ and give me the r-e-a-I, real thing

1:14:47.775 --> 1:14:49.402
j“ real thing j“

1:14:49.568 --> 1:14:51.529
supposing somebody sees?

1:14:52.863 --> 1:14:55.616
Get it out under the table.
Just a quick flash.

1:14:55.741 --> 1:14:58.035
All right, I will if you will.

1:14:58.160 --> 1:14:59.620
J“ don't want no mail order thing

1:14:59.787 --> 1:15:01.580
j“ and give me the r-e-a-I, real thing j“

1:15:01.747 --> 1:15:03.308
just a quick glimpse,
that's all you're getting,

1:15:03.332 --> 1:15:05.084
and then I want those negatives.

1:15:05.251 --> 1:15:06.669
What negatives?

1:15:06.752 --> 1:15:08.921
The negatives I'm
supposed to be buying.

1:15:09.046 --> 1:15:11.799
Basil: I'll buy you anything
if you'll come back to my place.

1:15:33.988 --> 1:15:38.242
Thank you. No, that's fine.
I'll be fine. Really. Thank you.

1:15:48.836 --> 1:15:51.255
- Hi there.
- Hi.

1:15:53.591 --> 1:15:56.260
Look, I expect you're wondering
what I'm doing behind the curtain,

1:15:56.427 --> 1:15:58.554
- dressed like this, but...
- Happens all the time.

1:15:58.679 --> 1:16:01.932
- Autograph hunters, they'll try anything.
- No, no.

1:16:02.016 --> 1:16:04.727
Look, I'm a private detective.

1:16:04.852 --> 1:16:06.872
- I've come to...
- You're the guy rosco's looking for?

1:16:06.896 --> 1:16:09.356
- Ssh.
- Isn't this terrific?

1:16:09.482 --> 1:16:11.317
You know, ever since
I was a little girl,

1:16:11.400 --> 1:16:12.943
I've had secret fantasies

1:16:13.069 --> 1:16:14.487
about dicks.

1:16:16.363 --> 1:16:18.592
Are you here to investigate
the boss's illegal activities?

1:16:18.616 --> 1:16:20.034
No, no, no, no.
Nothing like that.

1:16:20.159 --> 1:16:22.119
But, listen, you don't know
what you're missing.

1:16:22.244 --> 1:16:24.371
I'm engaged to his son, legs Luigi.

1:16:24.455 --> 1:16:26.457
Oh, Lisa Moroni, by the way.

1:16:26.582 --> 1:16:29.293
You've probably heard of me.
I'm an international superstar.

1:16:29.376 --> 1:16:31.837
What did you say your name was?

1:16:31.962 --> 1:16:34.965
- Blake. Judd Blake.
- Judd Blake?

1:16:35.091 --> 1:16:38.177
- Yeah.
- The judd Blake?

1:16:39.762 --> 1:16:42.431
- Yeah.
- Oh, that is terrific.

1:16:42.556 --> 1:16:45.601
Listen. What are you investigating?
Murder, blackmail?

1:16:45.726 --> 1:16:47.478
Murder and blackmail.

1:16:47.561 --> 1:16:49.772
Well, that's terrific.
How can I help you?

1:16:49.855 --> 1:16:52.650
Well, for a start,
you could get me out of here.

1:16:53.651 --> 1:16:55.152
I've got an idea.

1:16:58.030 --> 1:17:01.325
Okay, fellas, could you just
bring it in here? Be very careful.

1:17:01.450 --> 1:17:04.578
There are valuable things in it.
Place it down there. All good.

1:17:04.703 --> 1:17:08.833
That's beautiful. Thank you, fellas,
thank you. Okay. Thank you.

1:17:17.842 --> 1:17:21.095
- Where are we?
- Oh, this is my place.

1:17:21.178 --> 1:17:24.390
- You okay?
- I've gone all stiff.

1:17:24.515 --> 1:17:27.893
- Really?
- Look, I'm, er...

1:17:28.018 --> 1:17:30.080
I'm very grateful to you
for helping me get out of...

1:17:30.104 --> 1:17:34.817
Listen, it's nothing.
You can show your gratitude later.

1:17:34.942 --> 1:17:36.861
Maybe you'd care to
take a shower, huh?

1:17:36.944 --> 1:17:39.363
Bathroom's through there.

1:17:41.490 --> 1:17:44.451
Oh, I'll fix us a couple of drinks.

1:17:46.453 --> 1:17:47.913
All right.

1:17:57.882 --> 1:18:00.217
I can't stay too long.

1:18:00.384 --> 1:18:03.721
I've got to get back so as I can
finish off solving the case I'm on.

1:18:03.846 --> 1:18:06.724
So, what's a couple of hours?

1:18:12.021 --> 1:18:13.355
Terrific.

1:18:14.899 --> 1:18:16.525
Drink?

1:18:22.156 --> 1:18:23.407
Thanks.

1:18:31.957 --> 1:18:33.876
- Legs.
- Bugsy. What are you doing here, huh?

1:18:34.001 --> 1:18:36.128
You been with my Lisa?
I kill you, I kill you.

1:18:36.253 --> 1:18:39.465
We just took some costumes
up to her apartment, that's all.

1:18:39.632 --> 1:18:41.193
How do I know
you tell me the truth, huh?

1:18:41.217 --> 1:18:42.635
On my mother's grave,
I swear it.

1:18:42.760 --> 1:18:45.095
Your mother is not even dead.

1:18:45.221 --> 1:18:47.056
So, is that my fault?

1:18:47.848 --> 1:18:50.017
Nobody makes a fool
of legs Luigi, huh?

1:18:50.142 --> 1:18:53.187
The one thing I don't like is
other men being with my Lisa.

1:18:53.312 --> 1:18:54.855
They start getting ideas.

1:18:54.939 --> 1:18:57.358
Usually the ones
that she gives them.

1:19:04.198 --> 1:19:06.116
J“ I'm Moroni with an

1:19:06.242 --> 1:19:07.701
j“ not morone with an "e"

1:19:07.868 --> 1:19:10.579
j“ 'cause morone with an "e"
means "moron" j“

1:19:13.958 --> 1:19:16.877
right, you two stand guard here, huh?

1:19:19.255 --> 1:19:21.131
Surprise, surprise.

1:19:22.591 --> 1:19:25.219
Lisa, it's me, your little legs.

1:19:30.015 --> 1:19:31.225
Lisa?

1:19:31.350 --> 1:19:33.143
Hey, Lisa, open the door. Lisa?

1:19:34.603 --> 1:19:36.605
Lisa:
Legs! Fancy you coming round.

1:19:36.730 --> 1:19:38.899
- Legs: Who is in the shower?
- Lisa: Oh, no-one.

1:19:39.024 --> 1:19:41.735
Legs: I don't believe you.
There's somebody in the shower.

1:19:41.860 --> 1:19:44.071
Lisa: You're crazy. I was running
that shower for myself

1:19:44.488 --> 1:19:47.241
how come the door,
she is locked from the inside, huh?

1:19:47.366 --> 1:19:49.952
You know what these doors are like,
they're always sticking.

1:19:56.417 --> 1:19:58.335
See?

1:19:58.419 --> 1:20:00.796
Oh, legs! Legs!
Legs, my darling!

1:20:06.510 --> 1:20:09.430
- Oh, legs.
- Lisa.

1:20:09.555 --> 1:20:12.016
I got some flowers for you, huh.

1:20:13.142 --> 1:20:16.020
These are men's clothes.
What are they doing here, huh?

1:20:16.145 --> 1:20:18.981
- Ah... costumes!
- Costumes?

1:20:19.148 --> 1:20:21.900
Yeah, for a new number
I've been rehearsing.

1:20:22.067 --> 1:20:23.736
J“ follow the yellow brick road, ha-ha j“

1:20:23.819 --> 1:20:25.195
costumes, huh?

1:20:25.279 --> 1:20:28.240
You've got somebody in here.
A man, yes? Where is he, huh?

1:20:28.407 --> 1:20:31.618
You know, you can really be
a jerk sometimes. You're so jealous!

1:20:31.744 --> 1:20:34.288
Mamma Mia, I kill him, I kill him.
Where is he, huh?

1:20:34.413 --> 1:20:37.333
Legs... legs, don't be...
Legs! Legs, listen.

1:20:40.002 --> 1:20:42.439
- Legs, there is nobody here. Really.
- Hiding in the wardrobe, huh?

1:20:42.463 --> 1:20:43.547
Really, legs.

1:20:43.630 --> 1:20:45.230
Legs: He must be here.

1:20:45.257 --> 1:20:47.509
Lisa: No. There isn't, legs.

1:20:48.761 --> 1:20:50.679
- There is no-one here.
- Under the bed, huh?

1:20:50.804 --> 1:20:51.847
- Legs.
- Under the bed.

1:20:51.972 --> 1:20:55.351
- No, nobody under the bed.
- If I get him, I kill him.

1:20:55.517 --> 1:20:57.394
Under the bed, huh?

1:20:59.355 --> 1:21:01.398
- Or behind the curtains.
- Jesus Christ.

1:21:06.195 --> 1:21:07.237
A-ha!

1:21:07.363 --> 1:21:09.365
Behind the curtains, huh?

1:21:14.203 --> 1:21:16.121
You're laughing
at your little legs, huh?

1:21:16.205 --> 1:21:18.123
You think I'm stupid, huh?

1:21:18.248 --> 1:21:21.710
Well, itell you.
Nobody laughs at legs Luigi.

1:21:24.505 --> 1:21:28.342
Um... legs, um... why don't we
just have a drink, huh?

1:21:28.509 --> 1:21:32.638
- Right. Then I rip your knickers off, huh?
- Terrific.

1:21:32.763 --> 1:21:36.183
I'll hang up the coat
and you get the drinks, huh?

1:21:36.350 --> 1:21:41.021
You say no. No, I tell you. You get
the drinks, I put the jacket away.

1:21:43.273 --> 1:21:45.943
What do you think I am? Stupid?

1:21:46.110 --> 1:21:49.363
Nobody makes a fool
of legs Luigi, huh? Nobody.

1:22:04.962 --> 1:22:07.339
Nobody makes a fool of legs Luigi.

1:22:07.423 --> 1:22:09.716
Nobody makes a fool...
I need the drink.

1:22:09.800 --> 1:22:11.677
Hey, legs, I got a better idea.

1:22:11.802 --> 1:22:14.602
Why don't we just skip the drinks
and do the knickers bit instead, huh?

1:22:14.763 --> 1:22:15.806
Sounds like a good idea.

1:22:15.889 --> 1:22:18.267
What you doing, huh?
You spoil the buttons on my shirt.

1:22:18.392 --> 1:22:19.726
Don't be so silly, darling.

1:22:19.810 --> 1:22:22.855
Don't you know
I'm so divinely decadent.

1:22:22.938 --> 1:22:26.108
- Okay, Valentino. Hit it!
- Oh, Lisa, my darling.

1:22:56.221 --> 1:22:57.806
It's no good.

1:22:57.890 --> 1:22:59.516
Something must have happened.

1:22:59.683 --> 1:23:01.563
Otherwise he wouldn't have
stayed out all night.

1:23:01.685 --> 1:23:04.396
- You know what he's like.
- Yes, that's what worries me.

1:23:04.521 --> 1:23:07.733
Well, maybe he found out who
the blackmailer was and got held up.

1:23:07.816 --> 1:23:09.860
Maybe he's found out
who the blackmailer is

1:23:09.985 --> 1:23:11.820
and got himself murdered.

1:23:11.987 --> 1:23:14.799
- No, I'll have to go and get the police.
- What, you're going to phone them?

1:23:14.823 --> 1:23:17.701
No, somebody might hear me, and
that somebody might be the blackmailer.

1:23:17.868 --> 1:23:21.580
- Do you want me to come with you?
- No, you stay here in case he comes back.

1:23:23.248 --> 1:23:26.418
I just hope he won't be too hurt
when he finds out about us.

1:23:26.543 --> 1:23:28.212
It could break his heart.

1:23:29.087 --> 1:23:32.299
I have that effect on men, you know.

1:23:32.424 --> 1:23:33.717
I'll go and get the police.

1:23:35.761 --> 1:23:37.137
Morning, craddock. Blake in?

1:23:37.262 --> 1:23:40.474
I haven't seen him, sir.
He's probably upstairs in his room.

1:23:40.557 --> 1:23:42.017
Right.

1:23:42.142 --> 1:23:44.770
I've got something really good here.

1:23:45.395 --> 1:23:46.730
Great.

1:23:49.775 --> 1:23:51.944
- Haven't you ever heard of knocking?
- Oh, no!

1:23:52.110 --> 1:23:53.487
You miss more scoops that way.

1:23:53.612 --> 1:23:56.174
Yes, well you're not going to
have one of me starkers, for a start.

1:23:56.198 --> 1:23:57.574
This is slightly more important.

1:23:57.699 --> 1:24:00.202
Right, where's judd?
I want to show him this.

1:24:00.327 --> 1:24:03.789
I was thumbing through the back issues
of the newspaper last night and I found it.

1:24:03.914 --> 1:24:04.957
What about it?

1:24:05.082 --> 1:24:07.376
Well, look at it!
Look at the photo of the regatta.

1:24:07.501 --> 1:24:09.336
Who is standing there?

1:24:10.796 --> 1:24:12.357
Can't see a thing without my glasses.
Hang on.

1:24:12.381 --> 1:24:15.300
It's that bloke who was murdered,
Scott radleigh.

1:24:15.467 --> 1:24:18.720
Can you see who he's standing next to?

1:24:18.887 --> 1:24:21.640
- Oh, yes.
- Oh, yeah.

1:24:21.765 --> 1:24:23.767
Now, my deal is this.

1:24:23.892 --> 1:24:26.895
I won't take this to the police,

1:24:27.020 --> 1:24:30.232
if judd will give us an exclusive on
whatever it is he's up to at the moment.

1:24:30.399 --> 1:24:32.901
- Conniving little sod, aren't you?
- Yeah.

1:24:33.068 --> 1:24:34.528
Where's judd, then?

1:24:34.653 --> 1:24:36.154
That's what we'd all like to know.

1:24:40.242 --> 1:24:42.286
Bob: Lisa.

1:24:45.455 --> 1:24:46.582
Lisa!

1:25:10.814 --> 1:25:12.608
- I'm freez...
- Ssh!

1:25:19.990 --> 1:25:22.034
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!
Don't shoot, huh?

1:25:23.910 --> 1:25:26.038
- Oh, no, please.
- Oh, my!

1:25:26.580 --> 1:25:28.749
- No, please.
- Say your prayers, my friend.

1:25:28.915 --> 1:25:30.292
No, no, please. Please!

1:25:30.375 --> 1:25:32.878
I'll cut you into little pieces!

1:25:33.003 --> 1:25:34.963
- You tryin' to make a fool...
- No, listen...

1:25:35.172 --> 1:25:36.923
Couldn't we talk this over?

1:25:39.676 --> 1:25:41.094
No, please.

1:25:51.438 --> 1:25:53.815
Isn't it terrible? He just fainted.

1:26:00.447 --> 1:26:02.074
Oh, terrific!

1:26:02.240 --> 1:26:03.950
Shit!

1:26:30.811 --> 1:26:32.020
Shalom.

1:26:46.118 --> 1:26:47.411
Hi-yah!

1:27:35.709 --> 1:27:37.711
Mr purdy.
Purdy & purdy, solicitors.

1:27:37.836 --> 1:27:41.047
Ah, yes. You were expected, sir.

1:27:41.214 --> 1:27:42.942
Well, if you could
assemble everyone together,

1:27:42.966 --> 1:27:46.511
so that I can dispose of this business
of the late mr Ashley dotrice's will

1:27:46.595 --> 1:27:48.346
and hand over the estate accordingly.

1:27:48.513 --> 1:27:49.866
- Most definitely, sir.
- Craddock!

1:27:49.890 --> 1:27:51.490
Have you seen miss Sutton
anywhere about?

1:27:51.558 --> 1:27:53.393
I believe she went to the stables.

1:27:53.518 --> 1:27:54.811
Come on.

1:28:09.534 --> 1:28:11.411
Here! You're supposed to be dead.

1:28:11.495 --> 1:28:12.829
Sorry to disappoint you, love.

1:28:12.913 --> 1:28:15.499
I discharged myself
from hospital this morning.

1:28:15.624 --> 1:28:17.435
- You haven't got the money, have you?
- It's in the house.

1:28:17.459 --> 1:28:19.336
So are the negatives,
with my partner,

1:28:19.461 --> 1:28:22.088
who should be handing them
over to mr purdy any minute now.

1:28:22.214 --> 1:28:24.108
Looks like you've lost the estate,
doesn't it, darling?

1:28:24.132 --> 1:28:25.467
Oh, no, it doesn't.

1:28:25.592 --> 1:28:27.844
You see, we happen to know
who your partner is.

1:28:27.969 --> 1:28:30.555
- You're bluffing.
- Show him, wilfred.

1:28:32.015 --> 1:28:33.975
Listen, if I don't turn up
inside that house

1:28:34.059 --> 1:28:35.977
in the next few minutes
to say you've paid up,

1:28:36.102 --> 1:28:38.563
purdy will get those negatives.

1:28:39.731 --> 1:28:41.983
What you going to do, darling?
Shoot us?

1:28:42.150 --> 1:28:44.069
You weren't very successful last time,
were you?

1:28:44.194 --> 1:28:46.196
This time I'll make sure.

1:28:49.658 --> 1:28:51.868
I never did like the look of her
from the start.

1:30:18.288 --> 1:30:20.081
Woman: Hey!

1:30:49.235 --> 1:30:50.235
Look, I'm...

1:30:50.278 --> 1:30:52.280
I'm sorry about
your car, love, but...

1:31:28.817 --> 1:31:31.987
- Can't get the key out.
- Stand back. Let me.

1:31:53.091 --> 1:31:55.552
"These terms named
miss Laura Sutton

1:31:55.677 --> 1:31:58.888
"as sole heir to
his whole estate and fortune.

1:31:59.014 --> 1:32:02.767
"And this inheritance is to take place
at twelve noon today,

1:32:02.934 --> 1:32:04.704
- "on the 25th of this month..."
- It was her!

1:32:04.728 --> 1:32:07.313
"Shut not thy merciful ears
to our prayer,

1:32:07.439 --> 1:32:09.691
"but spare us, lord most holy,
o god most mighty."

1:32:10.984 --> 1:32:14.112
"O holy and merciful saviour, thou...

1:32:19.701 --> 1:32:21.494
"Thou most worthyjudge eternal,

1:32:21.536 --> 1:32:24.164
"suffer us not at our last hour
for any pains of..."

1:32:24.289 --> 1:32:25.957
Bob: Where am I?

1:32:26.082 --> 1:32:28.501
Here, give us a hand...

1:33:22.097 --> 1:33:23.181
Brakes!

1:33:37.695 --> 1:33:39.823
Amateur, Robert, amateur.

1:33:40.031 --> 1:33:41.950
I did almost solve it.

1:33:45.203 --> 1:33:48.289
Hmm. You shouldn't have
been solving anything.

1:33:49.332 --> 1:33:52.252
A little slower and a little lower please,
miss Walker.

1:33:52.377 --> 1:33:54.212
Don't be too hard on him,
mr Blake.

1:33:54.254 --> 1:33:56.965
After all, everything has worked out
all right in the end.

1:33:57.090 --> 1:33:59.008
Maud and I are getting engaged.

1:33:59.134 --> 1:34:01.112
The estate going to the two daughters,
as it should.

1:34:01.136 --> 1:34:04.347
Radleigh and Clarissa inside for blackmail,
and Laura for attempted murder.

1:34:04.472 --> 1:34:07.976
Yes, I never did like the look of her
from the start.

1:34:08.101 --> 1:34:10.079
Derek: There is one thing
I don't quite understand.

1:34:10.103 --> 1:34:12.856
Who was it that Bob was supposed
to meet in the club that night?

1:34:12.981 --> 1:34:15.775
Somebody Clarissa or Scott would have
sent along to do the pick-up.

1:34:15.900 --> 1:34:18.027
It's very simple.
In fact, from the sound of it,

1:34:18.153 --> 1:34:21.114
the whole case was pretty obvious
from the start.

1:34:21.239 --> 1:34:22.782
Yeah. Well...

1:34:22.907 --> 1:34:24.117
I nearly got it right.

1:34:24.242 --> 1:34:26.077
Yes, well, you don't become
a famous detective

1:34:26.202 --> 1:34:27.722
by nearly getting
things right, Robert.

1:34:27.829 --> 1:34:29.956
But I had suspects.
I'm very good at suspects.

1:34:30.081 --> 1:34:32.709
I think you should be grateful
I haven't decided to fire you.

1:34:32.834 --> 1:34:34.502
I am, mr Blake.

1:34:34.669 --> 1:34:38.006
Good, then how would you like
to crack a case for me?

1:34:38.131 --> 1:34:39.299
Really?

1:34:43.052 --> 1:34:45.805
What kind of case is it, mr Blake?

1:34:45.930 --> 1:34:50.351
A case of champagne to celebrate
that young couple's happy engagement.

1:35:30.475 --> 1:35:33.019
J“ callin' all cars,
it's a quarter to three

1:35:33.186 --> 1:35:35.855
