WEBVTT

00:01.919 --> 00:04.878
As such, we can expect
to finish our full supply of coal

00:04.963 --> 00:06.249
by November next,

00:06.340 --> 00:08.297
unless we begin stepping down
the ship's heating plans now.

00:09.343 --> 00:10.800
And that's without
any future days

00:10.886 --> 00:12.627
making way under steam
factored in.

00:14.223 --> 00:17.091
Of salt beef,
we've a combined total of 750 lbs.

00:17.184 --> 00:20.598
Salt pork, 210.
Flour, 902.

00:20.687 --> 00:22.223
Cheese, 87.

00:22.314 --> 00:25.227
Dried fruits, 9 lbs...
only after making the men

00:25.317 --> 00:27.274
Lady Jane's Christmas pudding
last week.

00:27.361 --> 00:28.943
Hear, hear.

00:30.948 --> 00:35.238
Of lemon juice,
not quite 200 gallons remain.

00:35.327 --> 00:37.193
Though Dr. MacDonald suspects

00:37.287 --> 00:40.030
it's lost most of its
antiscurvy properties by now.

00:41.458 --> 00:44.201
As for the tins,
we've now inspected every one

00:44.294 --> 00:45.626
and tossed out the putrid.

00:45.712 --> 00:48.921
It's clear now why the
Stephan Goldner Tinned Foods Company

00:49.007 --> 00:50.214
was the low bidder.

00:50.300 --> 00:52.041
I'd like to run that man through.

00:52.135 --> 00:56.470
What's left number
1,402 tins preserved meats,

00:56.557 --> 00:59.550
1,163 preserved vegetables,

00:59.643 --> 01:02.056
911 preserved soup,

01:02.145 --> 01:04.227
1,182 potatoes.

01:04.313 --> 01:06.055
And when is the point
of no return?

01:07.442 --> 01:11.106
If we reduce
to three-quarter rations,

01:11.196 --> 01:14.030
we'll reach the end of our
provisions midwinter next year,

01:14.116 --> 01:16.483
if we're stuck in again
with no game.

01:16.577 --> 01:19.866
That, with our current roster
of 116 men.

01:19.955 --> 01:22.447
Why mention the number of men,
Lieutenant?

01:25.335 --> 01:30.421
We've not seen hide nor even a hair
of Mr... teeth and claws.

01:30.507 --> 01:32.089
I think we can be confident

01:32.175 --> 01:34.212
that Mr. Blanky here,
along with Mr. Hodgson,

01:34.303 --> 01:36.010
killed it or ran it off for good.

01:36.096 --> 01:39.305
Now, the men will notice that large
a reduction in what they eat.

01:39.391 --> 01:43.010
They'll begin with four-fifth
rations and we will discuss

01:43.103 --> 01:45.095
how to reduce further
in a month's time.

01:45.188 --> 01:47.305
And, finally, advise Mr. Wall
and Mr. Diggle

01:47.399 --> 01:50.062
that they should emphasize
salt meats in their menus now,

01:50.152 --> 01:51.939
not the tins.

01:52.029 --> 01:53.611
We must...

01:53.697 --> 01:56.656
We must start to preserve
all things portable now.

02:02.873 --> 02:04.865
And not a word of this yet
to anyone

02:04.958 --> 02:06.119
who is not around this table,

02:06.209 --> 02:08.622
excepting the Captain,
of course.

02:08.711 --> 02:10.794
I pray he is with us again soon.

02:11.923 --> 02:15.712
Thank you, gentlemen.
That completes our business for today.

02:15.802 --> 02:17.919
Mr. Blanky, a word in private.

02:18.013 --> 02:21.757
The rest of you Terrors can suit up.
We won't be long.

02:23.060 --> 02:24.346
Gentlemen...

02:26.813 --> 02:29.851
We always feel worse
in the darker months, don't we?

02:31.777 --> 02:34.485
First sunrise
is just a week away now.

02:35.572 --> 02:37.609
Try to encourage the men with that.

02:50.295 --> 02:51.877
Please, sit down.

02:56.009 --> 02:59.252
You make that contraption work
like a ballet.

02:59.346 --> 03:01.338
If this is about Captain Crozier, sir,

03:01.431 --> 03:02.842
Jopson's a regular mongoose.

03:02.933 --> 03:04.925
Keeps us all out most of the day.

03:05.018 --> 03:07.101
No, it's not that.

03:07.187 --> 03:09.895
You said to Francis
the night of your attack,

03:09.981 --> 03:12.018
what happened to John Ross at Fury Beach

03:12.109 --> 03:13.725
could happen to him, too.

03:13.819 --> 03:16.687
I've had a chance to read Ross's memoir,

03:16.780 --> 03:19.818
and I found nothing self-critical there.

03:21.034 --> 03:25.779
You... refute the truth of his account.

03:28.625 --> 03:31.538
Someone's gonna have to think
of a new kind of memoir, sir,

03:31.628 --> 03:33.210
if truth is what you're after.

03:34.464 --> 03:37.423
I'm interested in what actually
happened, Mr. Blanky.

03:37.509 --> 03:39.250
In... in your words.

03:41.555 --> 03:43.421
You read the book.

03:43.515 --> 03:46.508
So you know we spent
three winters on the <i>Victory.</i>

03:46.601 --> 03:48.763
Yes. Nearly the same as we.

03:48.854 --> 03:50.641
Captain would have tried for a fourth

03:50.731 --> 03:52.688
if we hadn't run out of food.

03:54.735 --> 03:57.227
We shouldn't have waited to start walking.

03:57.320 --> 04:00.563
By the time we got to it,
the scurvy was in us...

04:00.657 --> 04:03.741
and Captain Ross,
he had no sympathy for illness.

04:04.661 --> 04:06.402
What do you mean?

04:07.581 --> 04:09.664
We sledged the boats with us.

04:11.752 --> 04:14.586
We were carrying half a load
a day's march,

04:14.671 --> 04:16.663
then doubling back for the other half.

04:18.759 --> 04:22.173
I finally begged Ross
to drop the boats altogether

04:22.262 --> 04:25.505
but he replied he'd rather
leave our sick to die.

04:26.475 --> 04:29.559
This from his position
riding atop one of the sledges.

04:30.937 --> 04:33.930
It was 300 miles to Fury Beach.

04:34.024 --> 04:36.186
We were barely standing.

04:36.276 --> 04:37.892
What little love we had amongst us

04:37.986 --> 04:40.273
was the only thing keeping us civil.

04:41.364 --> 04:44.357
We had one day's provisions left. One.

04:45.702 --> 04:48.194
Were it not for the cache
of stores left there

04:48.288 --> 04:50.450
from the wreck of the <i>Fury,</i>

04:50.540 --> 04:53.704
we'd still be on that beach,
bleaching in the wind.

04:55.378 --> 04:59.292
We tried to row out
to the whaling channels

04:59.382 --> 05:01.294
but the ice kept us back.

05:02.719 --> 05:05.132
This is where you built Somerset House?

05:07.224 --> 05:08.715
Aye.

05:09.726 --> 05:11.308
Somerset House.

05:12.729 --> 05:15.016
Even there, Ross kept rank.

05:15.774 --> 05:17.390
The officers kept their stewards

05:17.484 --> 05:20.477
and their wolf blankets,
and what salmon we could catch.

05:20.570 --> 05:22.482
The rest of us just slept in ice ditches

05:22.572 --> 05:24.484
and fought over year-old biscuits.

05:25.617 --> 05:28.826
And once it's past all hope,
the mind goes...

05:30.413 --> 05:32.325
unnatural with thoughts.

05:33.542 --> 05:35.829
What... what kind of thoughts?

05:36.920 --> 05:40.163
Like splitting open Sir John Ross's head
with a boat axe.

05:42.717 --> 05:45.755
You said you wanted the truth, sir,
in my own words.

05:45.846 --> 05:48.338
Trust you won't court martial me
for them now?

05:50.725 --> 05:52.466
Would you have done it?

05:56.481 --> 05:57.813
Leads opened up in the August.

05:57.899 --> 05:59.686
We got picked up by the <i>Isabella.</i>

05:59.776 --> 06:01.733
We'd been taken for dead for two years.

06:03.780 --> 06:07.694
Mr. Blanky, most of the men survived.

06:09.703 --> 06:11.865
If that's the point
you want me to get to, sir,

06:11.955 --> 06:13.537
then, yes, we survived.

06:13.623 --> 06:16.331
But if we're gonna
walk out of here ourselves,

06:16.418 --> 06:18.910
and almost three times as far,
you need to understand

06:19.004 --> 06:21.246
it wasn't sickness or hunger

06:21.339 --> 06:23.001
that most mattered to our chances.

06:24.301 --> 06:25.792
It's what went on up here.

06:27.596 --> 06:28.803
Notions.

06:29.973 --> 06:32.010
A darkness.

06:32.267 --> 06:34.429
With no fair man to stem it.

06:41.484 --> 06:43.350
I know many were thinking what I was.

06:43.987 --> 06:46.900
Sir John Ross,
he never knew how close he came.

06:51.870 --> 06:54.283
This kind of darkness...

06:54.539 --> 06:56.155
do you see it among us here?

06:57.167 --> 06:59.500
I don't need to see it to know it's here.

07:01.171 --> 07:02.878
You've time enough to vent it.

07:04.007 --> 07:05.168
How?

07:05.258 --> 07:08.092
First of all, if you're gonna
keep things from the men,

07:08.178 --> 07:11.137
you'd better give them
something in return now.

07:13.099 --> 07:17.184
<i>Something to keep their minds on,
other than what lies ahead.</i>

07:17.979 --> 07:21.222
<i>There'll be a tally for it,
later, when things get hard.</i>

07:22.651 --> 07:24.062
<i>There always is.</i>

07:54.307 --> 07:57.300
Leave it to you, Sir John.

08:43.273 --> 08:45.765
Why are you doing that?

08:46.943 --> 08:48.775
Dr. MacDonald will be here soon.

08:50.196 --> 08:54.031
Dr. MacDonald won't mind
if I have hair astray.

08:54.117 --> 08:57.736
Turmoil on the inside
needn't show on the out, sir.

08:58.288 --> 09:02.999
You forget, I've gotten turmoil
all over you,

09:03.084 --> 09:05.952
and the bed, in the last hour alone.

09:06.046 --> 09:09.630
Just let me lie in it. It'll teach me.

09:09.716 --> 09:13.630
It is you, sir, who is teaching
the rest of us.

09:16.056 --> 09:17.843
Jopson...

09:18.892 --> 09:20.884
yours is the only company

09:20.977 --> 09:23.720
that I don't completely hate right now.

09:24.606 --> 09:26.313
Now don't push it.

09:27.108 --> 09:29.600
How do you feel?

09:29.694 --> 09:31.936
like Christ...

09:32.030 --> 09:33.771
with more nails.

09:35.325 --> 09:36.907
Sir?

09:36.993 --> 09:38.484
Here.

09:42.832 --> 09:44.118
Only sips, sir.

09:44.209 --> 09:46.075
- More.
- No.

09:46.169 --> 09:51.381
The doctor is the captain
in this matter, sir. Full stop.

09:55.136 --> 09:56.672
You've done this before.

09:58.056 --> 09:59.968
Who was it?

10:02.852 --> 10:05.811
Every word I say hurts.

10:07.023 --> 10:09.811
Don't get mysterious, Jopson.

10:13.863 --> 10:16.071
It was my mother, sir.

10:16.157 --> 10:17.739
Your mother?

10:17.826 --> 10:19.283
Yeah.

10:19.369 --> 10:21.031
Ohh.

10:22.914 --> 10:28.000
She, uh, she took my brother
to a circus in Marylebone.

10:28.837 --> 10:30.954
The crowd was seated up on risers.

10:31.047 --> 10:33.164
You know how they pack them in
to sell more seats.

10:34.717 --> 10:37.084
My brother dropped his shoe beneath him.

10:37.846 --> 10:39.382
But they were sitting low enough

10:39.472 --> 10:41.134
that my mother could
reach down and get it.

10:42.809 --> 10:45.222
And that's when the whole
contraption collapsed.

10:47.063 --> 10:48.770
Her hand was smashed.

10:50.984 --> 10:54.523
She kept it but it was too maimed
to ever use again.

10:55.405 --> 10:58.068
And the only thing that would
take away the pain

10:58.158 --> 10:59.524
was Laudanum.

11:01.703 --> 11:03.569
You were a boy?

11:03.663 --> 11:08.249
No, this was just before we set sail
to the Antarctic in '39.

11:09.460 --> 11:11.668
She wanted me to go.

11:11.754 --> 11:14.121
She didn't want me
to miss the opportunity.

11:16.092 --> 11:18.926
But she was a different woman
by the time we got back.

11:20.763 --> 11:22.095
Pardon me, sir.

11:22.182 --> 11:24.265
No, go on.

11:27.020 --> 11:28.761
Well, problem was...

11:29.772 --> 11:31.308
it made her happy.

11:35.778 --> 11:38.316
She would stop breathing in the night.

11:38.406 --> 11:40.318
She'd soil herself.

11:41.409 --> 11:43.321
She'd get mesmerized

11:43.411 --> 11:46.119
to the point where she would
forget to feed my brother,

11:46.206 --> 11:48.198
or herself, for days.

11:49.459 --> 11:52.202
But it took away her pain
and it made her laugh.

11:52.295 --> 11:54.127
Hmm.

11:56.049 --> 11:58.507
I don't like to hear a woman
laughing now, sir.

12:02.096 --> 12:05.885
Our neighbor was a nursemaid
from the workhouse

12:05.975 --> 12:09.139
and she helped me taper Mother
off it for three weeks.

12:10.146 --> 12:12.103
How did she fare...

12:13.816 --> 12:15.478
when she was through it?

12:18.488 --> 12:19.695
Hello.

12:21.491 --> 12:22.823
Shooting the cuff, eh, sir?

12:22.909 --> 12:25.242
You look ready to dance a polonaise.

12:26.329 --> 12:28.446
Thomas...

12:29.582 --> 12:31.414
I've got you, Captain.

12:32.835 --> 12:34.417
You can count on that, sir.

14:20.651 --> 14:24.520
Lieutenant Irving seems busy
since he got back.

14:24.614 --> 14:26.446
With the Purser.

14:27.283 --> 14:30.196
The usual accounting, I'd imagine.

14:30.286 --> 14:32.027
No, they've done that.

14:32.914 --> 14:34.576
Now they're moving all the canned food

14:34.665 --> 14:36.406
to the back of the storeroom. Why?

14:37.543 --> 14:39.455
I've not heard a reason.

14:39.545 --> 14:42.458
But I did see an odd list
on Lieutenant Hodgson's desk.

14:43.508 --> 14:45.295
An inventory to be filled out.

14:45.385 --> 14:49.880
- An inventory of what?
- Empty things. Trunks, crates.

14:49.972 --> 14:52.385
Gather round, everyone. Men, up.

14:52.475 --> 14:55.218
Lieutenant Le Vesconte
has a message from Captain Fitzjames

14:55.311 --> 14:57.177
that's going to put a beam
in all your steps.

14:57.271 --> 14:59.263
Christ, they're counting
the luggage, Billy.

14:59.357 --> 15:01.724
Luggage for what?
Luggage for what, Cornelius?

15:01.818 --> 15:05.232
We've got a bit of a benjo
planned for first sunrise.

15:05.321 --> 15:09.156
Captain Fitzjames has proposed a carnival.

15:23.005 --> 15:25.622
A worse case of gastritis
surely there never was.

16:50.927 --> 16:53.135
Mr. Armitage.

16:59.268 --> 17:01.351
Always wanted to be a marine, that one,

17:01.437 --> 17:03.429
but for his dumb ear.

17:04.190 --> 17:05.681
He longs for it.

17:06.776 --> 17:08.517
What about you, Mr. Hickey?

17:10.112 --> 17:12.023
Did you always wanna be a caulker?

17:12.114 --> 17:14.026
That man owes you one too, you know.

17:14.617 --> 17:17.859
Who, Armitage? Yeah? How's that?

17:17.954 --> 17:19.661
For not pointing him out...

17:19.747 --> 17:21.704
being part of grabbing that Eski girl.

17:21.790 --> 17:23.623
You'd have been in your rights to.

17:24.544 --> 17:26.752
I didn't see the point in it.

17:26.837 --> 17:30.251
Even still? After getting flogged?

17:31.300 --> 17:33.337
That sort of thing can change your sense

17:33.427 --> 17:34.713
of what the point is.

17:34.804 --> 17:36.386
It did.

17:37.515 --> 17:40.303
I'm grateful... is the point.

17:42.853 --> 17:44.469
Reformed you, did it?

17:44.564 --> 17:46.806
I shouldn't have listened to you.

17:46.899 --> 17:49.141
And I deserved to be flogged.

17:50.069 --> 17:53.062
Yeah, and by ordering it,
the Captain, he's given me a chance

17:53.155 --> 17:55.488
to clean my record and start anew.

17:56.826 --> 17:58.613
Do you think Crozier sees it like that?

17:58.703 --> 18:00.319
A new Mr. Hartnell?

18:00.413 --> 18:01.574
I do, yeah.

18:04.125 --> 18:06.492
And I intend to use that charter well.

18:09.672 --> 18:11.584
What about you, Mr. Hickey, eh?

18:16.679 --> 18:18.762
Why didn't you turn Armitage in?

18:25.688 --> 18:27.554
That's it, lads.

18:34.822 --> 18:38.566
There it is. We've not heard
that sound in far too long.

18:39.702 --> 18:42.285
We're using a lot of supplies, sir.

18:42.371 --> 18:45.864
We can't possibly carry
all this come Spring.

18:45.958 --> 18:49.201
So it's settled, then? We're walking?

18:50.880 --> 18:52.917
Well, Francis will decide.

18:54.300 --> 18:56.542
Yes, it does seem inescapable now.

18:57.887 --> 18:59.719
He was right all along.

19:00.681 --> 19:02.593
And we were deaf to him.

19:05.478 --> 19:07.219
Listen, Lieutenant...

19:08.814 --> 19:12.353
we need to give the men
a last hurrah before...

19:14.195 --> 19:16.482
before we open their ears.

19:19.200 --> 19:21.442
Have you chosen a disguise?

19:21.535 --> 19:23.276
I gave our trunk to the men.

19:23.371 --> 19:25.738
Most of the officers are making their own.

19:25.831 --> 19:28.699
Don't wait to choose until all
the best ideas are snapped up.

19:39.804 --> 19:42.296
I was, er, looking for Dr. Goodsir.

19:43.265 --> 19:46.383
Mr. Goodsir is I know not where.

19:46.477 --> 19:48.469
Helping with construction, perhaps,

19:48.562 --> 19:51.680
as I thought you would be, Mr. Collins.

19:51.774 --> 19:53.936
Are you ill?

19:54.026 --> 19:56.564
I've been in a bad way. Yes.

19:56.654 --> 20:00.318
- Are you with fever?
- No, it isn't that.

20:04.787 --> 20:06.904
It's my thoughts, sir, they're...

20:08.290 --> 20:09.952
flurried somehow.

20:10.042 --> 20:12.910
Flurried thoughts?
I do not know what that means.

20:26.559 --> 20:29.302
Do you ever feel like
your mind is against you?

20:34.734 --> 20:37.522
I sign up for all the extra work I can.

20:37.611 --> 20:40.024
I holystone the deck
like a ship's boy.

20:40.114 --> 20:41.946
I can't really stand to be alone.

20:42.032 --> 20:43.864
No man is alone on a ship.

20:43.951 --> 20:45.487
I know it.

20:46.579 --> 20:48.320
But I do feel alone.

20:48.998 --> 20:50.910
All the time now.

20:51.000 --> 20:52.912
Every day, it's like a...

20:55.463 --> 20:56.795
a trap door, sir.

20:57.840 --> 20:59.502
Like I feel something's
about to open up

20:59.592 --> 21:01.959
and pull me into some hidden space
I won't get back from.

21:02.052 --> 21:03.839
What is that, Doctor?

21:03.929 --> 21:07.889
All the men's spirits are low.
It is winter. We expect that.

21:10.019 --> 21:13.603
I don't believe the others feel
as I do, sir.

21:13.689 --> 21:16.477
You do not know how the others feel.

21:22.740 --> 21:25.608
Mr. Collins, does your gut hurt you?

21:27.119 --> 21:29.361
- My gut, sir?
- Are you dyspeptic?

21:29.455 --> 21:31.868
With blisters? Dropsical about the knee?

21:31.957 --> 21:34.745
Do you require camphor
or a Dover's powder?

21:35.461 --> 21:36.542
No, sir.

21:36.629 --> 21:38.621
I am a doctor of medicine, Mr. Collins.

21:38.714 --> 21:40.296
Do you understand what that means?

21:45.971 --> 21:49.555
But I think what you need to do
is keep busy,

21:50.726 --> 21:54.140
to keep putting your energy
to positive use.

21:54.230 --> 21:56.313
Which is exactly why Captain Fitzjames

21:56.398 --> 21:58.060
has ordered a party made.

21:58.984 --> 22:01.727
It is a prescription I support
for all the men.

22:03.113 --> 22:05.480
Look forward to the party, Mr. Collins.

22:05.574 --> 22:08.658
A little fun is what is needed.

22:09.870 --> 22:11.577
- Fun?
- Yes.

22:12.748 --> 22:14.740
A sense of fun.

22:25.427 --> 22:27.419
Is that your daughter, sir?

22:28.931 --> 22:30.513
Yes.

22:32.601 --> 22:34.058
Good night, Mr. Collins.

22:34.144 --> 22:36.352
Does she love birds?

22:36.438 --> 22:38.100
Think of the carnival.

22:39.942 --> 22:43.606
It will sort us all out. I have no doubt.

23:13.017 --> 23:14.474
Ah.

23:54.266 --> 23:57.759
Mr. Goodsir. There's trouble
in the orlop you need to see.

23:57.853 --> 24:00.345
Immediately.

24:00.439 --> 24:03.227
Move, lads. Out of the way.

24:21.961 --> 24:24.578
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

24:45.734 --> 24:48.693
Mr. Hoar said you were looking for me.

24:48.779 --> 24:51.066
I've got used to being on
the same ship together.

24:51.156 --> 24:53.239
Reminds me of our seasons
on <i>The Gannett.</i>

24:53.325 --> 24:54.861
I didn't volunteer to berth here

24:54.952 --> 24:57.160
because I'm afraid
of the ice hassling <i>Terror,</i> John.

24:57.246 --> 25:00.660
Glad to hear that...
for more reasons than one.

25:04.753 --> 25:06.745
But I haven't finished with Voltaire.

25:06.839 --> 25:08.501
Put that aside.

25:08.590 --> 25:10.752
Has something happened?

25:12.594 --> 25:13.960
This is Xenophon.

25:15.264 --> 25:18.883
In Greek, the title is <i>Anabasis.</i>

25:18.976 --> 25:20.933
Which translates to
<i>The March of the 10,000.</i>

25:21.020 --> 25:23.012
- Do you know the story?
- No.

25:23.105 --> 25:24.641
When Cyrus the Younger

25:24.732 --> 25:27.065
wanted to seize the throne
of Persia from his brother,

25:27.151 --> 25:29.188
he hired an army of hoplite
to accompany him.

25:29.278 --> 25:31.019
They won the battle,

25:31.113 --> 25:33.196
but during the fighting, Cyrus was killed,

25:33.282 --> 25:35.945
which rendered the expedition obsolete.

25:36.035 --> 25:39.028
His army found themselves
in hostile country.

25:39.121 --> 25:40.862
Most of their officers were dead.

25:42.291 --> 25:44.954
They had to choose.
They could either stay

25:45.044 --> 25:47.252
and fight against
clearly unwinnable odds,

25:47.337 --> 25:48.873
or they could walk out.

25:54.136 --> 25:57.095
They walked for hundreds
and hundreds of miles

25:57.181 --> 25:58.888
through desert and snow,

25:58.974 --> 26:01.887
with no food,
and attacked on their flanks.

26:03.312 --> 26:05.099
But they made it, Henry.

26:09.068 --> 26:10.775
Read it.

26:11.904 --> 26:15.648
Begin to imagine how you'd
prepare for such a journey.

27:20.347 --> 27:23.431
Jopson? Are you there?

28:08.770 --> 28:10.602
Where's the fire, Mr. Goodsir?

28:10.689 --> 28:13.682
We need to talk. Now. Please.

28:20.324 --> 28:22.111
I didn't hear the bell, sir.

28:22.201 --> 28:24.318
sounds as though there's...

28:24.411 --> 28:26.027
...no one on board.

28:26.121 --> 28:28.033
No-one is, sir.

28:28.123 --> 28:30.206
It's Captain Fitzjames' Carnivale.

28:30.292 --> 28:32.033
We've just a single watch tonight.

28:32.127 --> 28:33.368
Everyone else is attending.

28:33.462 --> 28:35.704
- That's tonight?
- Yes, sir. All night.

28:36.423 --> 28:38.289
Until the sunrise.

28:39.968 --> 28:43.211
See if you can borrow a shotgun
off somebody on watch.

28:43.305 --> 28:44.887
I wanna see it.

28:46.099 --> 28:50.184
Well, it's a half-mile from the ship, sir.

28:50.270 --> 28:54.139
I will eat whatever that is on your tray.

28:55.484 --> 28:57.976
Make sure it stays put.

28:58.070 --> 29:01.313
And then you're gonna help me
get into my slops.

29:01.406 --> 29:02.988
Yes, sir.

29:08.455 --> 29:10.742
We've been fishing bits of it
out of our food,

29:10.832 --> 29:13.245
out of our mouths, this entire journey.

29:14.419 --> 29:18.254
It's a constant ingestion
of lead over years.

29:19.174 --> 29:21.416
This could explain David Young's passing,

29:21.510 --> 29:23.672
the men on Beechey...

29:23.762 --> 29:25.344
Why we've seen so many men

29:25.430 --> 29:27.968
come to us with these odd complaints.

29:29.977 --> 29:31.343
This is gonna get worse and worse.

29:31.436 --> 29:34.144
We need to let Command know
immediately.

29:36.149 --> 29:38.266
I will think it through
and decide on a plan.

29:39.778 --> 29:41.519
What is there to think through?

29:42.698 --> 29:45.031
Your energy is full of panic, Mr. Goodsir.

29:45.117 --> 29:46.824
And that will not help anyone here.

29:46.910 --> 29:48.276
I cannot stand by while...

29:48.370 --> 29:51.113
It is not yours to decide.

29:53.125 --> 29:56.209
I will do. You will not.

30:01.049 --> 30:04.042
Worse and worse, Doctor.

30:05.554 --> 30:07.216
Leave it with me.

30:40.255 --> 30:42.963
Welcome home, boys!

30:44.217 --> 30:46.049
Now, let's get our hair good and powdered

30:46.136 --> 30:48.298
before that damn sun finds us again.

31:27.177 --> 31:29.043
How did they manage all this?

32:04.339 --> 32:05.750
Wa-hoo!

32:08.301 --> 32:09.917
Captain...

32:21.231 --> 32:23.188
What do you mean? To where?

32:28.155 --> 32:30.238
Francis, you're back with us.

32:32.534 --> 32:34.275
Thomas.

32:41.585 --> 32:42.871
Aagh!

32:42.961 --> 32:44.998
Come on!

32:55.724 --> 32:57.636
Run! Run! Run! Run!

33:02.898 --> 33:04.605
Oi! Oi! Oi! Oi!

33:34.012 --> 33:37.676
Are we going, then, sir?
The men are saying...

33:37.766 --> 33:39.553
Step back, Mr. Reid.

33:58.203 --> 34:00.115
Let me take you back, sir.

34:01.748 --> 34:02.989
Sir?

34:18.598 --> 34:20.464
Is that the Captain?

34:25.647 --> 34:29.139
Come out of that pot.
Get dressed. I'm ending this now.

34:29.234 --> 34:32.898
Francis, this was my idea. All of it.

34:32.987 --> 34:35.525
To get the men ready.

34:40.495 --> 34:45.159
I see now, I... I should...
I should have been more vigilant.

34:45.250 --> 34:47.036
Ready?

34:52.841 --> 34:54.547
To walk out.

35:02.517 --> 35:05.430
Gather the men, James.

35:05.520 --> 35:07.477
They deserve to know.

35:07.564 --> 35:10.477
Men! Captain wishes to speak!

35:10.567 --> 35:12.433
Men, gather round!

35:12.527 --> 35:14.519
Come along!

35:20.660 --> 35:22.652
The captain wishes to speak!

35:25.540 --> 35:27.372
Silence, men!

35:28.668 --> 35:30.876
The Captain wishes to speak!

35:39.054 --> 35:43.344
Mr. Hickey. You're not in a stable.
Take it outside.

35:43.433 --> 35:46.141
Unless you want that ripped off?

35:56.988 --> 35:59.071
Remove your masks.

36:00.200 --> 36:03.614
Let us look one another
in the face... as men.

36:06.456 --> 36:08.789
Frozen ships are good shelters.

36:10.460 --> 36:12.372
But they are not our homes.

36:13.588 --> 36:17.081
We've got homes we need
to find our way back to.

36:19.427 --> 36:23.842
That is what you men are feeling
the call of out here tonight,

36:23.932 --> 36:29.303
not in daydreams, but in this
temple that you've built...

36:29.396 --> 36:31.513
to honor all that we miss...

36:39.698 --> 36:41.985
out of nothing and in little time...

36:43.451 --> 36:46.114
with only... vision...

36:46.204 --> 36:48.491
and good work.

36:50.291 --> 36:52.283
I marvel at what you men have made.

36:54.462 --> 36:59.753
All this is more important than you know
for what lies ahead.

37:04.264 --> 37:05.926
Let us speak plainly.

37:06.015 --> 37:10.225
In a few hours we welcome
the first sunrise of the year.

37:10.311 --> 37:12.644
It will mark the end of...

37:13.606 --> 37:15.472
the worst of a long and...

37:16.276 --> 37:18.142
strange winter.

37:24.492 --> 37:26.654
Strange in ways we will find...

37:27.287 --> 37:30.951
impossible to recount
when we are safe and home.

37:32.459 --> 37:35.702
To get there,
we can hope for a thaw come summer,

37:35.795 --> 37:38.538
but we no longer have
the luxury to wait for one.

37:40.467 --> 37:43.460
So as soon as there are enough
hours of light in the day

37:43.553 --> 37:47.422
for safe travel, and there are
no signs of a break-up,

37:47.515 --> 37:49.848
we will be abandoning both ships

37:49.934 --> 37:51.926
and walking out of here.

37:54.773 --> 37:59.438
South, for the mainland
and up Back's Fish River,

37:59.527 --> 38:02.190
to the Hudson Bay Company's
Fort Resolution.

38:03.948 --> 38:07.441
This will take us
overland across the length

38:07.535 --> 38:08.821
of King William Island.

38:08.912 --> 38:11.279
It is not inhabited year-round

38:11.372 --> 38:14.581
but... we will be crossing it
during hunting month

38:14.667 --> 38:18.877
and stand a good chance of
running into Netsilik people.

38:24.928 --> 38:27.295
They are a good people

38:27.388 --> 38:29.721
who we can greet as friends.

38:31.226 --> 38:35.436
Despite our shortfalls with them,

38:36.397 --> 38:39.606
they will help us, I am certain.

38:40.902 --> 38:43.485
It is an 800-mile journey.

38:44.739 --> 38:47.322
But by then, Lieutenant Fairholme

38:47.408 --> 38:49.775
and the party we sent out last year,

38:49.869 --> 38:53.328
will be on their way back
from Fort Resolution

38:53.414 --> 38:54.996
with help and supplies.

38:56.417 --> 38:59.410
And we have several veterans
of overland expeditions

38:59.504 --> 39:01.871
upon whose expertise we can rely.

39:01.965 --> 39:07.177
Dr. MacDonald, Mr. Blanky,
Captain Fitz...

39:10.557 --> 39:12.970
Make way! Make way!

39:30.493 --> 39:31.609
Let a man in.

39:57.979 --> 39:59.641
Doc.

40:03.818 --> 40:05.480
Stop him. Hold him!

40:05.570 --> 40:07.402
Hold him!

40:07.488 --> 40:09.901
Watch out!

40:10.909 --> 40:13.026
Stay back! Stay back!

40:25.048 --> 40:26.630
Put it out!

40:31.971 --> 40:33.963
Quickly!

40:34.849 --> 40:36.761
Fire! Men!

40:39.896 --> 40:43.435
Men! Fire! There's a fire!

40:52.909 --> 40:54.116
Get back!

41:01.376 --> 41:03.459
Ship's company, to the ice now!

41:03.544 --> 41:06.127
Ship's company, to the ice.
Calmly, men!

41:07.882 --> 41:09.248
To the ice, men, to the ice!

41:45.420 --> 41:47.878
This way! Through the kitchen!

41:47.964 --> 41:50.547
Go through the kitchen!

41:52.427 --> 41:56.171
It's blocked.
We can't get through this way!

42:05.773 --> 42:08.186
We need a lever! A spar, an oar!

42:08.276 --> 42:09.562
Bring an oar!

42:18.828 --> 42:22.287
Argh! No! No, no, no, no!

42:22.373 --> 42:23.534
No! No!

42:23.624 --> 42:26.082
Get back or I'll drop the bloody thing!

42:26.169 --> 42:28.456
Get back!

42:33.051 --> 42:35.134
Oar coming through!

42:40.391 --> 42:42.053
On my count. Three, two, one.

42:46.064 --> 42:49.648
You're crushing him!
Don't crush him!

42:49.734 --> 42:52.568
Stand back, I'm cutting through!
Stand back!

42:52.653 --> 42:54.394
Give him room!

42:54.489 --> 42:57.106
Stand back!

43:25.937 --> 43:27.769
Hurry up!

43:33.903 --> 43:35.519
Come on!

45:00.281 --> 45:02.864
James... go back.

45:03.910 --> 45:05.776
Others can do this.

45:07.955 --> 45:10.038
Come on. They need you on <i>Erebus.</i>

45:10.124 --> 45:11.786
These men need names yet.

45:13.085 --> 45:14.667
I'll have a tally later.

45:17.465 --> 45:21.379
Sir, I've been sending half
to <i>Erebus,</i> half to <i>Terror,</i>

45:21.469 --> 45:23.711
so we can be sure of having
enough supplies.

45:23.804 --> 45:26.387
Lady Silence I've sent to you.
She should be there by now.

45:26.474 --> 45:28.056
Thank you, Dr. Goodsir.

45:28.142 --> 45:31.476
I should be going, too,
only I don't know if Dr. Peddie's

45:31.562 --> 45:34.475
gone to <i>Terror</i> or <i>Erebus.</i>
I didn't see him to ask.

45:38.319 --> 45:39.981
Captain...

45:40.071 --> 45:43.314
I heard Tom Hartnell
say we lost Dr. Peddie as well.

45:46.244 --> 45:49.078
I can help Mr. Goodsir, if he'll have me.
