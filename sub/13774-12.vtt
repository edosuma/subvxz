00:00.843 --> 00:02.370
Season's greetings, everyone.

00:02.490 --> 00:03.520
From Kevin and Jenny.

00:03.640 --> 00:05.913
We wanted to take a minute to
wish you and your families a

00:05.981 --> 00:08.116
very happy and healthy holiday season.

00:08.183 --> 00:09.386
We have so much to be thankful for.

00:09.506 --> 00:11.229
We have a wonderful, healthy daughter.

00:11.349 --> 00:12.615
Amazing friends.

00:12.735 --> 00:13.640
Ugh! So delusional.

00:13.760 --> 00:17.620
And did we forget to mention that we
are both in the playoffs this season?

00:17.740 --> 00:18.465
Here we go.

00:18.585 --> 00:19.656
It seemed to have slipped my mind.

00:19.776 --> 00:24.555
Yes, we are so blessed to have not
one, but two teams in the playoffs.

00:24.675 --> 00:26.273
I mean, some homes don't have any.

00:26.393 --> 00:27.188
Andre.

00:27.308 --> 00:29.078
I never should have
made that trade with Taco.

00:29.198 --> 00:31.201
And this week's matchup
should be a a cakewalk.

00:31.321 --> 00:33.196
Yes. You're going to
obliterate Peter.

00:33.316 --> 00:34.942
You are going to kill Rodney.

00:35.010 --> 00:36.239
We'll see about that.

00:36.359 --> 00:40.286
And so, from the first family of fantasy
football... To your family at home...

00:40.577 --> 00:41.731
Suck it!

to you and your friends  d

00:50.783 --> 00:55.494
d we wish you a Merry Christmas
and a Happy New Year d

00:55.614 --> 00:57.072
Oh, that is awesome.

00:57.109 --> 00:58.993
- You did that so good, baby.
- Good job, princess.

00:59.014 --> 01:00.775
High five! Yes!

01:00.844 --> 01:01.944
You remembered all the words.
That was good.

01:02.011 --> 01:03.279
Well, most of the words.

01:03.547 --> 01:03.981
Okay.

01:04.048 --> 01:05.001
Thanks for coming, Pete.

01:05.050 --> 01:08.585
It's never too late to become the
godparent I've always wanted to be.

01:08.653 --> 01:09.787
- Really?
- Yeah

01:09.854 --> 01:12.088
Has nothing to do with
Ellie's very single teacher?

01:12.957 --> 01:15.059
Well, maybe a tiny...
Little bit.

01:15.126 --> 01:15.893
Tiny bit? Little bit?

01:15.960 --> 01:16.660
Great job, Ellie.

01:16.728 --> 01:17.895
Right?

01:17.962 --> 01:19.062
Very nice, miss Martin.

01:19.230 --> 01:21.164
Well, thank you very much, Mr.
Eckhart.

01:21.232 --> 01:23.233
Are we still good for our
after school appointment?

01:23.301 --> 01:25.001
Yes. Our appointment.

01:25.068 --> 01:26.002
We are on.

01:26.070 --> 01:27.170
Chinese food, maybe a movie?

01:27.238 --> 01:30.205
Sure. So, um, can actually
talk to you two for a second?

01:30.273 --> 01:30.606
Yeah. Sure.

01:30.674 --> 01:31.941
Yeah. Yeah.

01:31.909 --> 01:32.942
Uh, that sounds serious.

01:33.010 --> 01:34.010
That would be my cue.

01:34.378 --> 01:36.379
- Come on, let's head out.
- Thank you so much.

01:36.447 --> 01:38.815
So you do guys mind
taking a seat for a sec?

01:38.882 --> 01:40.216
Yeah. No.

01:40.284 --> 01:41.217
Sure. Okay.

01:41.285 --> 01:44.387
Great. Uh, we don't sit
like that in my class.

01:44.455 --> 01:45.321
Oh, yeah, no.

01:45.389 --> 01:47.390
Turn the chair around, please.

01:47.458 --> 01:49.360
- I don't sit like that in...
- Don't want to set a bad example.

01:49.427 --> 01:50.061
No. Right

01:50.130 --> 01:53.064
Okay, so Ellie has had some
behavior that has been slightly

01:53.132 --> 01:56.666
- troubling, and, um...
- Really?

01:56.734 --> 01:59.269
I had asked her to draw
a picture of her hero.

01:59.336 --> 02:02.305
Are you guys friends with a,
um, a man named The Flex?

02:02.872 --> 02:04.740
"Cady Williams."

02:04.808 --> 02:05.607
She spelled Williams correctly.

02:05.775 --> 02:07.576
She did.
She's an excellent speller.

02:07.644 --> 02:08.477
That's great.

02:08.544 --> 02:11.647
And then also, during lunchtime,
students often trade

02:11.715 --> 02:15.751
things out of their lunch boxes,
but Ellie seems to be running

02:15.819 --> 02:19.621
these incredibly elaborate,
like, three-way trades, and

02:19.689 --> 02:22.891
she's starting to act like a bookie.

02:22.959 --> 02:23.625
Really?

02:23.693 --> 02:28.931
She told one of the other students, summer,
to take a ride on her "suck stick."

02:28.999 --> 02:30.666
Frankly, I've never even
heard that phrase before.

02:30.734 --> 02:32.568
I've never ridden on
anyone's suck stick.

02:32.635 --> 02:33.402
I haven't either.

02:33.470 --> 02:35.437
Do you even know... do you
even know what that means?

02:35.505 --> 02:37.306
It could be like a
lollipop or a popsicle.

02:37.374 --> 02:41.343
Yeah, like... okay, I think
that may be inappropriate.

02:41.411 --> 02:44.346
No, we do not speak like
that in our home, not ever.

02:44.414 --> 02:45.647
Never.

02:45.715 --> 02:48.150
Ellie, I want you to meet someone.

02:48.218 --> 02:50.753
This is the elf on the shelf.

02:50.820 --> 02:51.987
Elf on the shelf?

02:52.055 --> 02:52.921
Yeah.

02:52.989 --> 02:58.360
This elf tells Santa who is being
naughty and who is being nice.

02:58.660 --> 03:01.060
- Really?
- He's watching you, all the time.

03:01.260 --> 03:02.660
So this little budy

03:02.999 --> 03:07.803
he's going to sit right up here and
he's going to keep his eye on you.

03:07.871 --> 03:08.470
Okay?

03:08.538 --> 03:10.506
And now I think it's time
for you to take a tubbie.

03:10.573 --> 03:11.507
Bath time.

03:11.574 --> 03:13.042
That's bull crap.

03:13.109 --> 03:14.176
What did you say, young lady?

03:14.244 --> 03:15.310
You heard me.

03:15.378 --> 03:18.047
Well, I'm sorry, what's that,
Mr. Elf on a the shelf?

03:18.114 --> 03:20.049
You're calling Santa right now?

03:20.116 --> 03:21.216
Uh-oh.

03:21.284 --> 03:22.518
Santa's being phoned.

03:22.585 --> 03:23.652
All right.

03:23.720 --> 03:26.021
Rtop busting my balls.

03:26.089 --> 03:28.390
Where-where did she learn
to talk like that?

03:28.458 --> 03:32.461
I knew we were going to have
the dick kid, I knew it.

03:32.529 --> 03:34.963
I'm going to get a sympathy
card and send it to your house.

03:35.031 --> 03:35.564
Why?

03:35.632 --> 03:36.565
'Cause you're dead.

03:36.633 --> 03:38.567
I'm going to shove my flex
player so far down your

03:38.635 --> 03:40.636
throat, you're going to be
able to taste it on Monday.

03:40.703 --> 03:42.971
You're in the playoffs now, okay?

03:43.039 --> 03:46.642
And you're going to choke like
Tony Romo every year, my friend.

03:46.709 --> 03:47.543
I love this.

03:47.610 --> 03:50.145
- Watching you two argue like this...
- Oh, God.

03:50.213 --> 03:52.081
Knowing that I don't even
have to participate.

03:52.148 --> 03:52.981
I'm above it.

03:53.049 --> 03:55.417
Are you claiming that you enjoy
not being in the playoffs?

03:55.485 --> 03:56.218
I love it.

03:56.286 --> 03:56.885
Really?!

03:56.953 --> 03:57.519
Stress-free.

03:57.587 --> 03:58.353
Had a great season.

03:58.421 --> 03:59.421
You had a terrible season.

03:59.489 --> 04:00.189
Horrible season.

04:00.256 --> 04:02.591
Until you play for the Sacko,
which you will, it's as if

04:02.659 --> 04:04.259
you're not in this league at all.

04:04.327 --> 04:05.260
You cease to exist.

04:05.328 --> 04:06.195
I exist.

04:06.262 --> 04:09.712
No, you are fading away like that
photograph in 'Back to the Future'.

04:09.888 --> 04:13.748
And until McFly screws Caroline
in the city, you're gone.

04:14.014 --> 04:16.995
By the way, Jenny and I got you
and Sophia a Christmas present.

04:17.055 --> 04:19.063
Wait, I thought we weren't doing
Christmas presents this year.

04:19.123 --> 04:21.211
No no, we do Christmas presents
because we're good people.

04:21.271 --> 04:23.425
I don't wanna give you a present,
you don't want to give me a present,

04:23.485 --> 04:25.127
why should we do it?
Why should we waste out time?

04:25.187 --> 04:26.536
Dude, you haven't even
thought about it yet?

04:26.596 --> 04:28.685
That is why you suck
at fantasy football

04:28.849 --> 04:31.127
'cause you're spending all year
getting people gifts that they hate.

04:31.187 --> 04:33.370
Oh, like you didn't like that
Iron Man II replica mask.

04:33.558 --> 04:36.118
- Well, Ruxin, how are you?
- Where's Andre?

04:36.446 --> 04:38.572
- Who?
- I don't know who you're talking about.

04:38.865 --> 04:40.568
- Who's this douchebag?
- Oh, this is Terry,

04:40.628 --> 04:42.264
the anorexic pumpkin
we're hanging out with.

04:42.851 --> 04:44.918
How did your date with Lindsey go?

04:45.088 --> 04:47.413
- Man, it was good.
- I love that you're going out

04:47.473 --> 04:48.599
with his kid's teacher.

04:48.781 --> 04:52.667
I mean, the woman whose hands are
shaping your daughter's future,

04:52.984 --> 04:56.330
are firmly grasping on to
Pete's tiny little doner.

04:56.390 --> 05:00.270
In all fairness, ermm, that's
not really happening right now.

05:00.330 --> 05:02.794
- What do you mean?
- I don't know, man, I mean things are good.

05:02.854 --> 05:04.978
Did you do your funny little joke
and then lean in for the kiss?

05:05.225 --> 05:08.316
I leaned in, I got the kiss,
and then, hrroooh.

05:08.563 --> 05:09.819
- Stone wall.
- Shut down.

05:09.879 --> 05:13.729
She had a kid, like, last year and she
keeps telling me that I'm not ready and--

05:13.789 --> 05:16.265
- That means she's not ready.
- She just had a kid.

05:16.523 --> 05:19.318
When Sophia had a kid, we didn't
have sex for six month.

05:19.677 --> 05:23.047
Baby Jeffrey just...
blew the church doors wide open.

05:23.107 --> 05:24.806
Baghdad's not ready for
the Olympics, okay?

05:24.874 --> 05:26.341
It's like a warzone down there.

05:26.409 --> 05:27.242
Yes, it's horrible.

05:27.310 --> 05:29.011
You should just send her over to me.

05:29.078 --> 05:30.946
I could hook you up with a
vaginal weight specialist.

05:31.014 --> 05:31.747
That's real?

05:31.814 --> 05:32.648
It's a real thing.

05:32.715 --> 05:34.183
It's kind of like working out.

05:34.250 --> 05:36.785
Women do these Kegel exercises
with weights that help

05:36.853 --> 05:38.120
strengthen the vaginal wall.

05:38.188 --> 05:41.190
Would there be such a thing as,
like, a vaginal strongman?

05:41.257 --> 05:43.258
Step right up and see the strongest
vagina in all of Coney Island.

05:44.027 --> 05:44.626
Only a nickel.

05:44.694 --> 05:47.437
Her labia can pull an
entire mack truck!

05:47.497 --> 05:50.210
- Ugh, ugh.
- Uh-huh, you made this gross.

05:50.398 --> 05:52.436
This was fun, and now
you're making it gross.

05:53.573 --> 05:56.974
Oh, from the McArthurs.

05:57.042 --> 05:59.677
Uncle Kevin and aunt Jenny sent
us a present that I didn't ask for,

05:59.745 --> 06:02.146
so I have to send them a
better present, 'cause I make

06:02.214 --> 06:03.448
more money than them.

06:03.515 --> 06:04.916
What do we got here?

06:04.983 --> 06:06.351
Look at this cool box.

06:06.418 --> 06:08.853
Kevin actually did
something nice for daddy.

06:08.921 --> 06:10.955
Oh! Ew!

06:15.694 --> 06:18.930
Oh, oh, gross eggs!

06:18.997 --> 06:22.033
Uncle Kevin just tried to stink
out daddy before the playoffs...

06:22.101 --> 06:23.134
get in his head.

06:23.202 --> 06:27.971
And now you're going to learn the most
important Ruxin family value... revenge.

06:28.039 --> 06:29.108
Okay?

06:30.876 --> 06:36.347
Milk, chicken... the milk gets rotten,
and the chicken gets rancid, and in a

06:36.415 --> 06:39.217
few days, it's going to explode.

06:40.419 --> 06:44.622
And Kevin's house smells like you
after you've eaten too many peanuts.

06:44.690 --> 06:46.958
Ta-da! Chicken-milk stink bomb.

06:47.025 --> 06:49.961
Yay! Merry Christmas, Kevin.

06:51.161 --> 06:54.561
Oh, hey, what's going on, Ellie,
good to see you.

06:54.910 --> 06:57.210
- Who is this guy that you have here?
- This is my elf.

06:57.410 --> 07:00.210
- Oh, what's his name?
- Kegel.

07:00.410 --> 07:03.130
- Oh, elf Kegel.
- Kegel, the elf.

07:03.230 --> 07:06.430
I wonder what job Kegel the elf
has in the North Pole.

07:06.630 --> 07:08.830
- I wonder how Kegel the elf got its name.
- What?

07:09.030 --> 07:11.030
- You're a doctor.
- You know that came from you.

07:11.230 --> 07:12.030
- This is my fault?
- Yes.

07:12.130 --> 07:16.030
Oh, yeah, I snuck into your house late
at night and gave her a Kegel color book.

07:16.080 --> 07:17.980
She got it from you.
No more foul language.

07:18.380 --> 07:21.880
- I have a clean mouth.
- No, you certainly do not.

07:22.080 --> 07:24.980
Look inward, my friends.
You have the dirtiest mouth I know,

07:25.180 --> 07:27.280
and you have the second
dirtiest mouth I know.

07:27.350 --> 07:29.850
- I do not.
- Yes, you do.

07:30.050 --> 07:32.070
Last week you told me to
take a ride on your suck stick.

07:32.110 --> 07:33.910
- Hey.
- I thought it was a compliment.

07:34.010 --> 07:35.490
Oh, and you should get off
your high horse

07:35.528 --> 07:38.606
because I believe it was last week on the
message board... it was you who

07:38.644 --> 07:40.144
called me a "cocktard."

07:40.212 --> 07:41.145
Oh!

07:42.013 --> 07:42.980
Like it.

07:43.047 --> 07:43.780
Cocktard, right?

07:43.848 --> 07:44.781
Good job.
Jo yeah.

07:44.849 --> 07:45.682
Blow it up.

07:45.750 --> 07:46.851
This is nice.

07:47.219 --> 07:49.453
Just because we're competing in
the playoffs, doesn't mean we

07:49.521 --> 07:52.523
can't take a moment to have a
nice, gentlemanly drink and

07:52.591 --> 07:54.292
celebrate our accomplishments.

07:54.359 --> 07:55.459
Thank you, sir.

07:55.527 --> 07:57.495
Cheers.

07:57.563 --> 07:58.496
So, how are you?

07:58.564 --> 08:00.765
How are things going with miss Martin?

08:00.832 --> 08:01.532
Things are great.

08:01.600 --> 08:03.534
There's a little bit
of an issue, though.

08:03.602 --> 08:08.906
She's having a little bit of a
confidence issue in this area, and...

08:08.974 --> 08:11.175
Let's use our words now,
Pete; Come on, now.

08:11.243 --> 08:11.809
Okay, fine.

08:11.877 --> 08:13.811
She's have a pussy confidence problem.

08:13.879 --> 08:14.645
Oh, not those words.

08:14.713 --> 08:17.815
And I was wondering if you might
have a little talk with her.

08:17.883 --> 08:18.749
Why me?

08:18.817 --> 08:21.085
No one has more confidence
than Jenny McArthur.

08:21.153 --> 08:22.186
No, no, no, no.

08:22.254 --> 08:26.290
If I remember correctly, you guys
accused me of vaginal hubris.

08:26.358 --> 08:27.525
Hey, I was wrong.

08:27.593 --> 08:28.459
I've changed my mind.

08:28.527 --> 08:29.093
Really?

08:29.161 --> 08:31.462
You need to share this with
the mothers of the world.

08:31.530 --> 08:34.265
So if you could talk to her and
maybe pump her up a little bit.

08:34.332 --> 08:37.434
How exactly do you see me
broaching this subject with her?

08:37.501 --> 08:41.005
Andre mentioned that there are
these weights that women use...

08:41.073 --> 08:42.472
Why would I do this for you?

08:42.541 --> 08:44.875
Because I'm your friend and
you want me to be happy.

08:44.943 --> 08:46.043
Not that bad.

08:46.111 --> 08:48.946
Well, if you don't, she might
just happen to be at my

08:49.014 --> 08:52.216
apartment and see a video post
of Ellie's mother swearing like

08:52.284 --> 08:55.386
a truck driver, and I might
encourage her to hold a special

08:55.454 --> 08:58.956
parent-teacher conference
on Sunday morning.

08:59.024 --> 09:01.459
I do the final tweaks to my
lineup on Sunday morning...

09:01.526 --> 09:02.760
Oh, I forgot about that.

09:02.828 --> 09:05.296
We should probably make the
deal then, shouldn't we?

09:05.364 --> 09:06.364
God, you're an asshole.

09:06.431 --> 09:07.298
It is decided.

09:07.366 --> 09:09.433
You...
It is decided.

09:09.501 --> 09:11.769
You...
It is decided.

09:11.837 --> 09:12.903
You are no gentleman.

09:12.971 --> 09:15.072
And neither are you.

09:15.140 --> 09:19.477
Oh, Christmas gift from Andre.

09:19.544 --> 09:21.245
From the federline collection.

09:21.313 --> 09:22.747
Jesus, Andre.

09:22.814 --> 09:23.581
Oh, hey, Ruxin.

09:23.649 --> 09:24.649
Where are you coming from?

09:24.716 --> 09:26.917
Same way I always get in... garage.

09:26.985 --> 09:27.952
What do you want?

09:28.020 --> 09:29.654
I want to know if you
received my valuables.

09:29.721 --> 09:31.255
I don't know what
you're talking about.

09:31.323 --> 09:32.289
My eggs... my year-old eggs?

09:32.357 --> 09:33.524
Those are your stinky eggs?

09:33.592 --> 09:35.860
Yeah. I'm making
thousand-year-old eggs.

09:35.927 --> 09:36.927
Only 999 years to go.

09:36.995 --> 09:40.531
I'm going to pass them down to my
children and my children's children.

09:40.599 --> 09:43.501
As curious as I am to see
what kind of spawn you're

09:43.568 --> 09:47.672
weed-soured nuts can create,
this has nothing to do with me.

09:47.739 --> 09:48.839
Yes, it does.

09:48.907 --> 09:51.246
I sent you my valuables
'cause you are my lawyer.

09:51.290 --> 09:55.446
Nahh, I'm not your lawyer, and you
don't send your valuables to a lawyer,

09:55.514 --> 09:56.681
you send them to a bank.

09:56.748 --> 09:59.450
In this case, you should send
your valuables to a trash can.

09:59.518 --> 10:01.352
You didn't throw them out, did you?

10:01.420 --> 10:04.288
No, because like any good lawyer,
I keep incriminating evidence.

10:04.356 --> 10:05.156
They're behind the shed.

10:05.223 --> 10:07.825
But I honestly thought that
Kevin sent them to me to stink

10:07.893 --> 10:10.828
up my house and screw with
my head before the playoffs.

10:10.896 --> 10:13.064
No, they got you a
wine-of-the-month club.

10:13.131 --> 10:14.065
It's really nice.

10:14.132 --> 10:15.800
What'd you give them?

10:15.867 --> 10:18.469
I gave them a huge mistake.

10:18.537 --> 10:20.971
Jackpot.

10:21.039 --> 10:25.009
It's nobody's birthday, Uncle Ruxin.

10:25.077 --> 10:26.677
Ellie, Ellie, no, no, no.

10:26.745 --> 10:27.511
What did I tell you?

10:27.579 --> 10:29.080
We don't... it's heavy!
It's a Wii!

10:29.147 --> 10:30.081
It's a Wii! It's a Wii!

10:30.148 --> 10:31.382
I don't know if it's a Wii.

10:31.450 --> 10:32.516
We'll have to wait and find out.

10:32.584 --> 10:34.585
We don't want to upset
Kegel the elf, now do we?

10:34.653 --> 10:36.487
I'll go get myself a
gingerbread cookie.

10:36.555 --> 10:37.521
No more cookies.

10:37.589 --> 10:38.656
You don't need any more sugar.

10:38.724 --> 10:39.690
Pipe down.

10:39.758 --> 10:42.560
Look at this... talking trash
already, just like her mother.

10:42.627 --> 10:43.594
Oh, hey, brother.

10:43.662 --> 10:44.662
Look who it is.

10:44.730 --> 10:46.764
What are you, uh, what
are you doing here?

10:46.832 --> 10:48.032
I have an invitation for you.

10:48.100 --> 10:48.566
Bro.

10:48.633 --> 10:49.433
For a birthday party.

10:49.501 --> 10:50.835
For...?

10:50.902 --> 10:51.602
Your eggs.

10:51.670 --> 10:53.070
Yeah. They're turning one.

10:53.138 --> 10:54.171
Well, gee, look at that.

10:54.239 --> 10:55.005
It's at my house.

10:55.073 --> 10:56.874
Yeah, this is a great party house.

10:56.942 --> 10:59.176
By the way, should I give you a
list of snacks, or are you just

10:59.244 --> 10:59.910
going to freestyle it?

10:59.978 --> 11:02.346
No, we're not having a party,
at this house, for your eggs.

11:02.414 --> 11:05.382
Trust me, you're going to change
your mind when you see these eggs.

11:05.450 --> 11:06.250
What?

11:06.318 --> 11:07.284
Check it out.

11:07.352 --> 11:09.120
No, no, no, no, no, no.

11:09.187 --> 11:11.388
Wow, huh?

11:11.456 --> 11:14.982
They smell like horse shit.
Get them out of our house, now!

11:15.022 --> 11:17.882
- I'll put them in thew fridge, they'll--
- Take them home with you

11:18.082 --> 11:19.482
- I'm just  gonna put them in the fridge.
- Ahh, don't--

11:19.512 --> 11:23.012
Oh, great, now look, they're just
gonna stink up the whole house.

11:23.212 --> 11:24.812
Oh, my God, no no, look!

11:26.010 --> 11:29.010
Ah, look, they didn't break.

11:29.211 --> 11:31.182
It's an eggs-mas miracle!

11:31.519 --> 11:34.183
- There's no eggs-mas.
- Oh, this party is going to get awesome.

11:34.243 --> 11:36.825
- And we're going to get hammered.
- I'd rather drink alone.

11:38.138 --> 11:40.164
- Lindesy, Dr. Andre Nuzik.
- Hi

11:40.224 --> 11:43.576
- Hi.
- Lindsey Martin, Ellie's first grade teacher.

11:43.870 --> 11:48.743
So, Dr. Nuzik  over here, is a 
very succesful plastic surgeon.

11:48.803 --> 11:54.983
And he also specializes in a very 
specific... nee-ch... you talk about it.

11:55.043 --> 11:58.629
Well, I am a... a doctor
who specializes in

11:59.838 --> 12:04.517
- vaginal strengthening and conditioning.
- Oh, were you Jenny's trainer?

12:04.670 --> 12:05.374
- No.
- Yes.

12:06.114 --> 12:09.284
- Maybe a little.
- A lot. I mean she's flacked off now

12:09.461 --> 12:11.482
I mean, yeah, now
I don't know what it's like,

12:11.850 --> 12:14.994
 but when we were working
together, it was... rock solid.

12:15.054 --> 12:15.553
All right.

12:15.620 --> 12:17.791
I mean, her kid came out big.

12:17.851 --> 12:19.189
That is beside the point.

12:19.459 --> 12:22.738
I think this is great that you guys
are sitting together at my table.

12:22.798 --> 12:24.395
It's like, you know, vagina fate.

12:24.462 --> 12:26.630
Lindsay just had a
baby ten months ago.

12:26.698 --> 12:27.598
She has a little baby boy.

12:27.666 --> 12:28.399
Oh my God.

12:28.466 --> 12:29.233
Love of my life.

12:29.301 --> 12:32.436
I don't know, maybe you should
set up a session with him.

12:32.504 --> 12:33.103
He's great.

12:33.171 --> 12:36.440
Oh, I would have loved to actually,
but I already have a doctor.

12:36.508 --> 12:37.474
Really?

12:37.542 --> 12:38.642
Who's your doctor?

12:38.710 --> 12:40.077
I train with Stu Beagle.

12:40.145 --> 12:41.078
Stu Beagle.

12:41.146 --> 12:42.413
Have you heard of Stu Beagle?

12:42.480 --> 12:45.549
Don't go into business with Stu
Beagle, that's what I always say.

12:45.617 --> 12:46.483
Hmm.

12:46.551 --> 12:48.986
Not somebody you would want
to open a wine bar with.

12:49.054 --> 12:50.821
I'm speeding through his program.

12:50.889 --> 12:51.822
Really?

12:51.890 --> 12:54.391
So you have all your strength back?

12:54.459 --> 12:56.894
Stronger than I have ever been, yeah.

12:56.962 --> 12:57.761
That's so great.

12:57.829 --> 12:58.462
He's fantastic.

12:58.530 --> 12:59.263
Awesome.

12:59.331 --> 13:01.765
So, you, um, you won't share
any of this with Pete, right?

13:01.833 --> 13:03.067
Oh, with Pete? No.

13:03.134 --> 13:04.993
Okay great. Well...
Thanks for coming.

13:06.006 --> 13:07.709
Of course I'm not going to tell Pete.

13:08.049 --> 13:10.840
Too fun to let him find that
out on his own... ca-cha!

13:10.907 --> 13:11.940
Goddamn Stu Beagle.

13:12.208 --> 13:13.977
I lost my shirt in that wine bar.

13:29.434 --> 13:30.567
Hello?

13:30.635 --> 13:32.936
Hi... Ellie.

13:33.004 --> 13:34.438
Uncle Ruxin?

13:34.505 --> 13:36.306
Are you an elf on the shelf?

13:36.374 --> 13:37.741
Yeah.

13:37.809 --> 13:39.443
Yeah, I'm an elf on the shelf.

13:39.510 --> 13:40.744
Just like Kegel?

13:40.812 --> 13:43.246
Just like... Kegel.

13:43.314 --> 13:46.116
Hey, where's the Christmas tree?

13:46.184 --> 13:48.585
Okay, where are the presents, Ellie?

13:48.653 --> 13:49.686
My daddy hid them.

13:49.754 --> 13:51.121
But I know where they are.

13:51.189 --> 13:52.789
Just tell me where the presents are.

13:52.857 --> 13:53.790
I'm an elf.

13:53.858 --> 13:56.293
I'm Santa's wartime consigliere.

13:56.361 --> 13:58.462
How do I know you're not lying?

13:58.529 --> 13:59.763
Do I look like a liar?

13:59.831 --> 14:01.698
You look like a great,
big, dirty liar.

14:01.766 --> 14:04.801
I think that might be anti-semitism, but
I'm willing to overlook it right now.

14:04.869 --> 14:06.970
Look, I will make it worth your while.

14:07.038 --> 14:07.704
What do you mean?

14:07.772 --> 14:09.940
I mean I'll give you a
crap ton of presents.

14:10.007 --> 14:11.108
What would you like?

14:11.175 --> 14:11.775
A pony.

14:11.843 --> 14:12.542
Done.

14:12.610 --> 14:13.510
A family of wolves.

14:13.578 --> 14:14.711
Easy-capeezie.

14:14.779 --> 14:16.380
And, how about this?

14:16.447 --> 14:20.317
A rose garden shaped like a puppy
that you can only see from

14:20.385 --> 14:23.286
a private plane, that who's piloting?

14:23.354 --> 14:24.788
Wuh-oh! Ellie is.

14:24.856 --> 14:26.957
All right, you got me on that one.

14:27.024 --> 14:27.524
All right.

14:27.592 --> 14:29.559
So where did daddy keep the presents?

14:29.627 --> 14:30.394
They're in the attic.

14:30.461 --> 14:31.628
So you go grab them for me.

14:31.696 --> 14:32.729
Here's the one I want.

14:32.797 --> 14:35.699
It's red wrapping with a
green ribbon around it.

14:35.767 --> 14:36.900
That's a jackpot one.

14:36.968 --> 14:39.302
While you're up there, I'm
going to call my wolf guy.

14:39.370 --> 14:40.537
Okay.

14:40.605 --> 14:41.505
Hi-ya.

14:41.572 --> 14:42.672
Good work.

14:42.740 --> 14:43.540
You're a funny elf.

14:43.608 --> 14:44.541
Yeah.

14:44.609 --> 14:48.078
Kid's dumber than her parents.

14:48.146 --> 14:49.579
I got it!

14:49.647 --> 14:51.748
Mm, good work, Ellie.

14:51.816 --> 14:52.983
Thank you.

14:53.050 --> 14:56.557
Now I wonder if we can have a
real quick chat, elf-to-man.

14:57.000 --> 14:58.006
Kegel and I have been talking.

14:58.806 --> 15:00.856
and word on the street is

15:00.925 --> 15:03.326
that you've been a little bit
of a dick recently.

15:03.394 --> 15:04.194
Me?

15:04.262 --> 15:05.896
Yeah. A real dick.

15:05.963 --> 15:07.364
I don't want to be a dick.

15:07.432 --> 15:10.066
Well, then maybe you should
just man up and behave.

15:10.134 --> 15:11.401
I'll man up.

15:11.469 --> 15:12.169
Okay.

15:12.236 --> 15:13.603
Good talk.

15:13.671 --> 15:14.604
Ellie?

15:14.672 --> 15:15.739
Police! Hide!

15:15.807 --> 15:17.407
No, give me the goddamn present.

15:17.475 --> 15:19.009
You down here, honey?

15:19.076 --> 15:19.876
What are you doing?

15:19.944 --> 15:22.712
Shit, shit, shit, shit.

15:25.583 --> 15:27.584
Aw!

15:29.921 --> 15:31.054
Chicken-milk stink bomb!

15:31.122 --> 15:33.423
I'm forever unclean!

15:33.491 --> 15:35.392
How is it?

15:35.460 --> 15:36.526
Oh, incredible.

15:36.594 --> 15:37.294
It is? It's good?

15:37.361 --> 15:38.895
You have nothing to worry about.

15:38.963 --> 15:40.263
You are, mm. Yes.

15:40.331 --> 15:42.432
Mm-hmm.

15:42.500 --> 15:43.266
She's amazing.

15:43.334 --> 15:44.134
Wow, she's amazing.

15:44.202 --> 15:45.101
Mm, you like that?

15:45.169 --> 15:46.536
I love that; Oh, my God.

15:46.604 --> 15:47.370
You like that?

15:47.438 --> 15:48.638
How about that?

15:48.706 --> 15:51.708
Oh, it's good. Um...
It's good?

15:51.776 --> 15:52.609
You know why?

15:52.677 --> 15:53.443
I've been working out.

15:53.511 --> 15:55.078
Yeah, you have been working out, yes.

15:55.146 --> 15:56.046
I can tell.

15:56.113 --> 15:57.113
You've got quite a grip.

15:57.181 --> 15:58.114
You like that?

15:58.182 --> 15:59.916
Yeah, it's...
Do you think I'm strong?

15:59.984 --> 16:00.750
Yeah, you're strong.

16:00.818 --> 16:01.885
You think I strong?

16:01.953 --> 16:02.786
Oh, you're crushing it.

16:02.854 --> 16:04.287
All right, yeah...
Oh, I'm crushing it?

16:04.355 --> 16:05.121
You're crushing it.

16:05.189 --> 16:05.922
I'm crushing it?

16:05.990 --> 16:07.257
Miss Martin, you're crushing...!

16:07.325 --> 16:07.891
Crushing?

16:07.959 --> 16:08.792
You're crushing it!

16:08.860 --> 16:10.427
I... crushed it!

16:10.495 --> 16:12.229
Ow!

16:12.296 --> 16:13.763
I did it; I won.

16:13.831 --> 16:14.598
You won.

16:14.665 --> 16:16.700
You took a dog and you
brought it to the top.

16:16.767 --> 16:19.493
I am going to the Shiva bowl, and,
baby, you are coming with me.

16:19.661 --> 16:23.513
- I'm so close I can taste it.
- You guys are so obsessed with who won

16:23.583 --> 16:27.352
and who lost. I mean, I'm not into
Shiva bowl, but I'm actually enjoying

16:27.423 --> 16:30.065
- the life bowl, right now.
- And you're losing at the life bowl as well.

16:30.335 --> 16:32.730
- The jury is still out on that, my friend.
- Hello.

16:33.094 --> 16:35.701
- Yeh, uh-huh.
- What is wrong with you?

16:35.761 --> 16:37.709
- Hey, hop-along.
- Uh-huh, you happy?

16:37.908 --> 16:39.511
Yes, I'm thrilled.

16:39.571 --> 16:42.506
Yeah, this is what happens, you get
to win when you have a few hours

16:42.670 --> 16:43.527
to set your lineup.

16:43.809 --> 16:46.592
Unlike me, who spent the last
three hours in the hospital

16:46.909 --> 16:50.243
- having his cock realigned.
- She dislocated your unit?

16:50.408 --> 16:51.999
Yeah, remember that scene
from Leathal Weapon 

16:52.059 --> 16:54.535
where he throws his shoulder out
and he's slamming it against the wall

16:54.595 --> 16:55.768
- to get it back in?
- Yeah.

16:55.828 --> 16:57.729
This hurt a lot worse, 
and I can assure you.

16:57.789 --> 17:00.805
That goddamn yoked up vagina
that you sicked on me

17:01.075 --> 17:04.127
- threw me around the bed like a rag doll.
- I thought that's what you wanted.

17:04.188 --> 17:06.406
No, I wanted firm, not terminator.

17:06.569 --> 17:08.602
You could still try and
lose like a gentelman.

17:08.662 --> 17:11.502
- Oh, I'm sorry, if I could walk maybe I'll--
- It is decided.

17:12.247 --> 17:14.103
- This is decided.
- This is low.

17:14.163 --> 17:17.378
- Go to the Shiva!
- Low, even for you this is low.

17:17.439 --> 17:19.665
How did the doctors even
find your tiny cock?

17:19.983 --> 17:21.998
You know, they couldn't
even identify it.

17:22.058 --> 17:24.140
It looked like a goddamn Joshua tree.

17:24.200 --> 17:25.468
Pete, you lost.

17:25.536 --> 17:26.269
You stink.

17:26.337 --> 17:27.404
You stink, Ruxin.

17:27.471 --> 17:29.406
We can smell you through the glass.

17:29.473 --> 17:30.307
You literally stink.

17:30.374 --> 17:31.942
I'm airing myself out.

17:32.009 --> 17:32.943
We're good to go.

17:33.010 --> 17:33.577
Let me in.

17:33.644 --> 17:34.477
Go to a homeless shelter.

17:34.545 --> 17:36.613
I can't go to a homeless shelter.

17:36.681 --> 17:38.315
They don't have directv there!
Duh!

17:38.382 --> 17:39.449
Come on, what's the score?

17:39.517 --> 17:42.786
You're up by a point, but you have
no players left and I have Akers.

17:42.853 --> 17:44.788
And Philly's within field goal range.

17:44.855 --> 17:45.822
That's what's going on.

17:45.890 --> 17:48.358
I'm going to the goddamn Shiva bowl!

17:48.426 --> 17:51.127
d Eggs-mas is my favorite
time of the year. d

17:51.195 --> 17:52.262
Great song, Taco.

17:52.330 --> 17:55.465
Guys, in order to celebrate
the eggs-mas miracle that

17:55.533 --> 17:58.868
happened in this very house only
a few days ago, I'm setting up

17:58.936 --> 18:01.938
an egg nativity scene
on the front lawn.

18:02.006 --> 18:04.040
It'll be open to the public
in just a few minutes.

18:04.108 --> 18:05.141
Donations are very welcome.

18:05.209 --> 18:07.877
All proceeds go towards my gas bill.

18:07.945 --> 18:09.012
Hey, Taco.

18:09.080 --> 18:11.281
Hey, Ruxin! Merry eggs-mas!

18:11.349 --> 18:13.350
I need to talk to you,
you stupid fruit fly.

18:13.417 --> 18:15.685
d Eggs-mas is my favorite
time of the year. d

18:15.753 --> 18:17.020
Oh my God, they're lining up.

18:17.622 --> 18:18.488
Don't call a time-out.

18:18.556 --> 18:20.857
I hate when they call time-outs.

18:20.925 --> 18:21.858
d Eggs instead of Jesus. d

18:21.926 --> 18:22.459
Taco.

18:22.526 --> 18:23.793
Ugh, what's that smell?

18:23.861 --> 18:25.028
That is not eggs.

18:25.096 --> 18:27.030
It's a chicken-milk stink bomb.

18:27.098 --> 18:27.964
This is all your fault.

18:28.032 --> 18:30.000
You and your stupid,
filthy stink eggs.

18:30.067 --> 18:31.134
No, no, these eggs are holy.

18:31.202 --> 18:32.002
Uh-uh.

18:32.069 --> 18:34.871
A pox on you and a pox on
those filthy stink eggs.

18:34.939 --> 18:37.040
Ruxin, he's lining up for the kick.

18:37.108 --> 18:38.408
Oh, God. Oh, God.

18:38.476 --> 18:42.912
Oh, eggs and Jesus and Santa and
Travolta's guy and, of course,

18:42.980 --> 18:46.216
Shiva, please let him miss this
kick and let me win this game.

18:46.283 --> 18:47.884
And please make him
stop stinking so much.

18:47.952 --> 18:50.020
Hey, quit bogarting my prayer, man.

18:50.087 --> 18:51.721
Okay, this is the
greatest day of my life.

18:51.789 --> 18:53.857
I hope the day Ellie was
born was a close second.

18:53.924 --> 18:54.858
Eh.

18:54.925 --> 18:55.525
Let it happen.

18:55.593 --> 18:58.061
Oh, God, we're one gimmie field goal
away from a all McArthur Shiva bowl.

18:58.129 --> 18:59.029
Do not jinx him.

18:59.096 --> 19:00.230
Jenny, there's no jinxing.

19:00.297 --> 19:04.063
You got a top-five kicker for a 37
yarder with no wind and... silence!

19:04.100 --> 19:08.068
Shh, here we go, snap is good,
go to the top, looks good.

19:08.128 --> 19:10.070
- Posed.
- Posed?

19:10.434 --> 19:14.385
Okay, I know you're upset right now,
but next week you're gonna be so relaxed.

19:15.589 --> 19:18.465
- Shit!
- I won!

19:18.665 --> 19:22.352
It's an eggs-mas miracle.
Ha-ha-ha-ha.

19:22.412 --> 19:25.135
- Oh this miracle smells like poo.
- Shit!

19:25.733 --> 19:28.364
- Did you lose?
- You shut your mouth.

19:28.739 --> 19:32.133
Every year i set this league up,
every year, and I never win.

19:32.309 --> 19:33.377
This was the year.

19:33.437 --> 19:34.597
(Bleep)!

19:34.665 --> 19:36.733
(Bleep), (Bleep), (Bleep)!

19:36.801 --> 19:38.101
Bullshit!

19:38.169 --> 19:39.302
I babysit you morons!

19:39.370 --> 19:40.236
I babysit you!

19:40.304 --> 19:41.037
"Oh, help me out.

19:41.105 --> 19:41.905
Do this, move that guy around!

19:41.972 --> 19:44.040
I don't know how
to set a lineup!"

19:44.108 --> 19:44.774
(Bleep) You!

19:44.842 --> 19:45.742
(Bleep) You, Taco!

19:45.810 --> 19:47.077
(Bleep) You, Ruxin!

19:47.144 --> 19:48.311
Stupid wise men!

19:48.379 --> 19:50.413
Stupid eggs!

19:50.481 --> 19:51.448
My eggs!

19:51.515 --> 19:54.117
Stupid, stupid, stupid...
Daddy, stop!

19:54.185 --> 19:55.118
Kegel's watching you.

19:55.186 --> 19:56.920
He's going to report to Santa.

19:56.987 --> 19:58.221
Look me in the eye, Ellie.

19:58.289 --> 19:59.556
There is no Kegel.

19:59.623 --> 20:02.425
And there is no Santa Claus and
there's no Christmas, there's no

20:02.493 --> 20:03.960
God, there's no Easter bunny!

20:04.028 --> 20:08.131
There's nothing, nothing, nothing,
nothing, nothing, nothing!

20:08.199 --> 20:12.736
Nothing......
I gotta say, I feel like I just won twice.

20:14.847 --> 20:18.016
This is a message for Pete, the
crown prince of douche-cockery.

20:18.084 --> 20:23.021
I'm here to let you know that, this
week, I am going to obliterate you.

20:23.089 --> 20:26.191
I am going to take my
metaphorical dick and I'm

20:26.258 --> 20:29.060
going to shove it so far up
your metaphorical vagina.

20:29.128 --> 20:32.230
And then I'm going to take a
go at your very real asshole.

20:33.098 --> 20:37.068
I'm super-excited about it, so
have a great week, jackass.

20:38.937 --> 20:40.905
Now we know where Ellie gets it from.

20:41.073 --> 20:43.039
Frankly, I was surprised,
my money was on you.
