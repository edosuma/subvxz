[narrator]
<i>Previously, on </i>Star Trek: Discovery:

00:13.972 --> 00:15.598
[woman] Commander, I can't get control!

00:15.682 --> 00:17.475
[Saru] All decks prepare for impact.

00:17.559 --> 00:18.601
[grunts]

00:18.685 --> 00:20.687
Lieutenant, get to Sickbay.

00:20.770 --> 00:22.480
[doctor] Neurological tests are clear.

00:22.564 --> 00:24.524
No concussion. You're good to go.

00:25.275 --> 00:26.109
[Detmer] What?

00:26.192 --> 00:27.694
I said, you're good to go.

00:28.695 --> 00:31.698
You made it through.
It was a pretty rough landing.

00:31.781 --> 00:35.493
-It's good to have you alive.
-I'm experiencing some discomfort.

00:35.577 --> 00:39.748
Yeah, you were impaled
by a 7-inch shard and put in a coma.

00:40.790 --> 00:43.460
-Michael?
<i>-Saru, I landed here a year ago.</i>

00:43.543 --> 00:47.589
Nobody knows if the Burn
was an accident or a natural disaster.

00:47.672 --> 00:50.759
But I did find part of a transmission
from an obsolete Starfleet channel.

00:50.842 --> 00:53.052
[over radio] <i>This is Admiral Senna Tal.</i>

00:53.136 --> 00:55.555
<i>I will wait for any</i>
<i>who would join us on Earth.</i>

00:55.638 --> 00:57.474
<i>The Federation lives on.</i>

00:57.557 --> 01:00.518
-Is he at Starfleet headquarters?
-We will find Admiral Tal.

01:00.602 --> 01:03.480
Senna Tal, the Starfleet officer
you've been looking for?

01:04.022 --> 01:04.898
I know him.

01:04.981 --> 01:08.651
Young Adira has been joined
with a Trill symbiont.

01:08.735 --> 01:10.904
-Trill?
-A sentient life form.

01:10.987 --> 01:13.114
Once they join the host,

01:13.448 --> 01:18.369
that host has the ability to access
the memories of all former hosts.

01:18.453 --> 01:19.871
Including Admiral Tal's.

01:19.954 --> 01:23.750
It seems Adira has difficulty accessing
those memories.

01:23.833 --> 01:27.295
She may carry knowledge
of what remains of Starfleet.

01:33.468 --> 01:36.221
[Culber]
<i>Medical Officer's log, supplemental.</i>

01:37.430 --> 01:40.642
<i>Our trip to Earth was eye-opening.</i>

01:41.226 --> 01:44.437
<i>A reality check, such as reality is.</i>

01:45.855 --> 01:50.109
<i>It's starting to hit everyone,</i>
<i>just how little we have to hold on to.</i>

01:51.694 --> 01:54.572
<i>The personal moments</i>
<i>we use to define ourselves.</i>

01:55.448 --> 01:56.282
<i>Birthdays.</i>

01:57.450 --> 01:58.409
<i>Anniversaries.</i>

01:59.536 --> 02:00.870
<i>Graduations.</i>

02:01.621 --> 02:02.539
<i>Funerals.</i>

02:03.706 --> 02:05.291
<i>We've jumped past all of them.</i>

02:06.793 --> 02:08.128
<i>They feel lost.</i>

02:09.671 --> 02:10.588
<i>Disconnected.</i>

02:15.510 --> 02:17.428
<i>I tell them I've been alone.</i>

02:17.971 --> 02:18.972
<i>I've been lost.</i>

02:23.434 --> 02:24.561
<i>Both are survivable...</i>

02:25.562 --> 02:27.856
<i>and surviving can become living again.</i>

02:30.400 --> 02:32.819
You know, if you ever needed to talk,
I'm around.

02:36.364 --> 02:37.198
I'm fine.

02:37.782 --> 02:39.742
[Culber]
<i>But first, they have to accept help.</i>

02:41.619 --> 02:42.996
<i>For a crew of overachievers,</i>

02:43.079 --> 02:46.332
<i>that kind of vulnerability</i>
<i>can be hard to hold.</i>

02:49.085 --> 02:50.795
<i>Five words keep everyone going:</i>

02:52.213 --> 02:53.965
<i>"When we find the Federation."</i>

02:55.300 --> 02:57.051
<i>It's become a mantra for the crew.</i>

02:59.137 --> 03:01.264
<i>In some cases, it seems to help.</i>

03:01.890 --> 03:03.349
All right.

03:03.850 --> 03:04.684
<i>In others...</i>

03:06.311 --> 03:07.270
<i>not so much.</i>

03:10.940 --> 03:13.318
<i>Adira, who joined us from Earth,</i>

03:13.401 --> 03:16.195
<i>may be able to guide us</i>
<i>to Federation headquarters</i>

03:16.279 --> 03:17.822
<i>once she regains her own memories</i>

03:17.906 --> 03:20.825
<i>and those of her symbiont's former host,</i>
<i>Senna Tal.</i>

03:21.117 --> 03:22.744
<i>This mission could be a gift,</i>

03:22.827 --> 03:25.246
<i>a reminder that we are,</i>
<i>and always will be,</i>

03:25.330 --> 03:27.999
<i>connected to something</i>
<i>greater than ourselves:</i>

03:28.249 --> 03:29.083
<i>The Federation.</i>

03:29.709 --> 03:30.919
[computer] <i>Scan complete.</i>

03:31.294 --> 03:33.463
[Culber] Well, the good news is
she's perfectly healthy,

03:33.546 --> 03:35.214
as is the symbiont.

03:35.298 --> 03:38.009
[Saru] Should we be concerned
it is wrapped around her heart?

03:38.259 --> 03:39.344
It's protecting me.

03:40.094 --> 03:43.765
Every critical system in my body
is connected to Tal.

03:44.891 --> 03:46.643
Wake up with a squid
in your abdominal cavity,

03:46.726 --> 03:48.269
it'll do your homework, too.

03:48.353 --> 03:50.605
[Burnham] So, you don't remember
how you got the symbiont?

03:50.688 --> 03:52.315
What's the first thing you do remember?

03:52.899 --> 03:57.070
I woke up in an escape pod a year ago
when that ship found me.

03:59.113 --> 04:01.824
Before that... nothing.

04:02.575 --> 04:04.994
Commander Stamets noted
that you demonstrated

04:05.078 --> 04:08.122
a surprising understanding
of our ship's engineering grid,

04:08.206 --> 04:11.209
a design about which
you should have no knowledge.

04:11.292 --> 04:15.338
Well, I can also speak seven languages
and cook a mean Bajoran hasperat.

04:16.464 --> 04:17.882
Have I always been a genius,

04:17.966 --> 04:20.885
or do these skills belong
to my squid's previous hosts?

04:20.969 --> 04:22.053
Well, if it is your--

04:23.263 --> 04:24.305
Your squid...

04:24.931 --> 04:27.058
then we should be getting
the full picture.

04:27.267 --> 04:28.851
So, something is blocking your memories.

04:28.935 --> 04:30.019
Like what?

04:30.103 --> 04:33.064
Oh, there's no way to know.
There's no precedent.

04:33.815 --> 04:35.024
So, we have two choices.

04:35.566 --> 04:37.318
I can start digging
around your hippocampus

04:37.402 --> 04:38.444
hoping to find an answer--

04:38.528 --> 04:39.904
-Bad.
-Bad.

04:40.697 --> 04:41.531
Or...

04:42.740 --> 04:43.825
we take you to Trill,

04:44.534 --> 04:45.994
if you and the captain agree.

04:48.913 --> 04:51.040
Adira, we have to be clear.

04:51.833 --> 04:54.002
No one's ever seen a human host.

04:54.377 --> 04:59.507
There's no way of knowing if the Trill
will be able or willing to assist you.

05:00.091 --> 05:03.845
So, I could go, and it could it be a bust,
and no one gets what they need.

05:03.928 --> 05:07.223
I don't get my memories,
you don't get Senna Tal's message,

05:07.307 --> 05:09.642
and you never find
Federation headquarters.

05:13.563 --> 05:15.732
Is there any way of knowing
if the Trill are as peaceful

05:15.815 --> 05:17.900
as they were a millennia ago?

05:18.526 --> 05:19.360
[Saru] No.

05:19.694 --> 05:20.987
That is also a risk.

05:21.738 --> 05:23.448
I can't keep living like this.

05:24.449 --> 05:25.700
Not knowing who I am.

05:28.703 --> 05:29.662
Let's go to Trill.

05:33.875 --> 05:35.501
[theme song playing]

07:16.394 --> 07:18.688
Scans confirm no weapon energy signatures.

07:18.896 --> 07:20.648
Nothing to indicate hostile intent.

07:21.232 --> 07:24.485
Well, let us hope that remains the case.
Keep us at yellow alert.

07:25.111 --> 07:27.822
Lieutenant Bryce, open a channel please.

07:28.030 --> 07:29.031
[Bryce] Yes, sir.

07:30.408 --> 07:31.242
Ring any bells?

07:32.160 --> 07:33.953
Does that planet look familiar?

07:36.330 --> 07:37.874
Wish I could say yes.

07:37.957 --> 07:41.252
Captain, Trill Commissioner Vos
is responding to our hail.

07:41.335 --> 07:42.879
Put him through, lieutenant.

07:46.966 --> 07:48.593
Welcome, Commissioner Vos.

07:50.136 --> 07:53.139
I am Captain Saru of the <i>USS Discovery.</i>

07:53.222 --> 07:54.849
Greetings, Captain Saru.

07:55.892 --> 07:58.644
It's been many years
since we've seen a Federation Starship.

07:58.728 --> 08:01.439
I trust our arrival is welcome.

08:02.565 --> 08:03.566
Most certainly.

08:04.358 --> 08:08.654
We have a host and symbiont onboard
who are in need of medical attention.

08:08.738 --> 08:10.490
We were hoping for your assistance.

08:11.407 --> 08:13.117
Our symbionts carry our history.

08:13.784 --> 08:17.288
Then the Burn,
the population was decimated.

08:18.206 --> 08:21.334
But to have a symbiont return home
is a blessing.

08:22.585 --> 08:25.755
We will send them down immediately,
accompanied by our ship's medical officer.

08:26.297 --> 08:27.507
We'll make preparations.

08:28.674 --> 08:29.759
Thank you, <i>Discovery.</i>

08:31.427 --> 08:34.305
Cancel the yellow alert.
Maintain standard orbit.

08:39.435 --> 08:40.520
[Saru] Dr. Stamets.

08:41.521 --> 08:43.564
I'd like to talk to you about your jumps.

08:44.565 --> 08:48.069
Second jump with no problems.
Fully recovered. I'm fine.

08:48.569 --> 08:52.198
You were impaled with a spike
and placed in a coma.

08:52.281 --> 08:54.158
Yeah, but other than that, he's fine.

08:54.242 --> 08:56.118
I can jump any time.

08:56.202 --> 08:57.620
The scarcity of dilithium

08:57.703 --> 09:01.123
has made the spore drive
immeasurably valuable.

09:01.207 --> 09:05.002
We will need the ability
to operate it without you, commander.

09:05.086 --> 09:07.922
I researched a non-human interface
for nearly a decade

09:08.005 --> 09:10.299
before we discovered
the tardigrade on the <i>Glenn.</i>

09:10.800 --> 09:11.801
Yes.

09:12.343 --> 09:18.432
And there has been 932 years
of technological advancement since then.

09:18.516 --> 09:21.894
We cannot risk becoming as limited
as every other ship in the galaxy

09:21.978 --> 09:25.273
should you be once again incapacitated.

09:30.736 --> 09:31.696
Of course, captain.

09:32.863 --> 09:37.660
Now, you and Ensign Tilly
are two of the finest minds on this ship.

09:38.244 --> 09:40.121
I have every confidence
you will find a solution.

09:45.626 --> 09:49.964
So, look, I-- I know now
might not be the best time.

09:50.631 --> 09:54.885
Um, what if we made a new interface
using a dark matter system?

09:55.636 --> 09:59.348
Dark matter is comprised
of subatomic particles,

09:59.432 --> 10:02.560
and the mycelial network
is a subspace domain.

10:02.643 --> 10:04.895
The prefix "Sub" being the only morpheme

10:04.979 --> 10:07.481
that even remotely connects
those two ideas.

10:08.899 --> 10:09.734
Yeah.

10:10.276 --> 10:12.612
I've run some preliminary calculations...

10:13.237 --> 10:16.949
using dark matter energy
to pierce the subspace domain.

10:17.033 --> 10:18.909
Look, if you're not ready
to talk about it--

10:18.993 --> 10:22.204
Look, this isn't
about "Isn't science cool?"

10:22.288 --> 10:25.916
It's about the lives
of everything and everyone.

10:27.168 --> 10:28.127
I know you're trying...

10:28.794 --> 10:31.380
but please, don't waste my time.

10:42.266 --> 10:43.142
[door chimes]

10:43.225 --> 10:44.060
Come.

10:46.812 --> 10:47.897
Do you have a minute?

10:49.231 --> 10:50.066
Please.

10:52.735 --> 10:53.986
You've been busy.

10:55.613 --> 10:58.032
It's everything I managed to find
on the Burn in the last year.

10:58.115 --> 10:59.700
So many missing pieces.

11:00.284 --> 11:01.118
Oh, I just--

11:01.202 --> 11:03.454
I meant, your space used to be so...

11:04.497 --> 11:05.373
Oh.

11:05.998 --> 11:07.792
-Empty.
-Yeah.

11:08.918 --> 11:11.837
Shouldn't you be headed
to the shuttle now?

11:12.588 --> 11:15.341
That's what I wanted to talk to you about.
I think you should be the one

11:15.424 --> 11:16.884
to take Adira to the surface.

11:17.468 --> 11:19.011
Her memory loss isn't a medical problem.

11:19.095 --> 11:21.347
She needs somebody
to support her emotionally.

11:24.642 --> 11:27.353
Why do you think that's me?

11:28.562 --> 11:32.566
Well, Adira's had almost everything
she's depended on stripped away.

11:34.652 --> 11:37.530
-I think you understand that.
-I think you do, too.

11:41.867 --> 11:43.244
You know, there's a theory.

11:44.412 --> 11:45.913
Post-traumatic growth.

11:45.996 --> 11:48.707
That certain life events...

11:49.458 --> 11:50.793
um, dying...

11:52.002 --> 11:53.129
time travel,

11:53.212 --> 11:55.631
a year alone in a new future...

11:56.507 --> 12:01.137
can inspire us to evolve,
to live our lives in a different way.

12:02.680 --> 12:05.015
You're still in the process of all that...

12:05.933 --> 12:07.351
but Adira's about to start.

12:10.771 --> 12:13.190
I don't even know how to navigate
being on this ship right now.

12:14.191 --> 12:16.110
And the people that I know and love...

12:17.111 --> 12:18.696
I know what they want from me.

12:20.406 --> 12:22.074
But I can't even give it to them.

12:23.159 --> 12:24.118
[chuckles]

12:25.202 --> 12:27.037
You know what I love about you most?

12:28.873 --> 12:30.541
You're a responsibility hoarder.

12:31.625 --> 12:33.377
-Yeah.
-[laughs]

12:34.128 --> 12:35.588
I am working on it.

12:36.380 --> 12:38.841
Your friends, your crew.

12:39.341 --> 12:42.928
The future of every living thing
in the galaxy, literally.

12:46.182 --> 12:48.058
Even when you're struggling yourself.

12:54.190 --> 12:57.109
[Adira] I'm sorry.
I just don't get why you're going with me.

12:57.193 --> 13:00.362
You know less about me than I do,
and that's saying a lot.

13:00.946 --> 13:03.741
A year ago, you woke up with no memories,
and I woke up with no past.

13:03.949 --> 13:07.620
Ten seconds after I crash-landed
out of the wormhole, I puked.

13:08.746 --> 13:10.998
Okay, that's not exactly
a confidence booster.

13:11.707 --> 13:12.541
I bet.

13:13.209 --> 13:16.253
Okay, I'm--
Look, maybe I should just go by myself.

13:17.379 --> 13:19.340
-If you're good.
-Yeah, I'm good.

13:20.716 --> 13:21.550
Okay.

13:23.677 --> 13:25.262
[computer] <i>Attention all crew.</i>

13:25.346 --> 13:28.724
<i>Rotation assignments have been posted</i>
<i>and are effective immediately.</i>

13:28.807 --> 13:30.601
Look, Dr. Culber is a pretty smart guy.

13:30.684 --> 13:32.770
I've trusted him with my life
and I'd do it again.

13:33.020 --> 13:34.730
And he thinks I should escort you.

13:36.065 --> 13:37.107
Well, I like him.

13:37.733 --> 13:38.567
So...

13:40.236 --> 13:42.821
you can come, but two things.

13:42.905 --> 13:46.075
Wait. So, you're saying you trust
Dr. Culber because you like him,

13:46.158 --> 13:47.159
not because he's a doctor?

13:47.243 --> 13:50.246
Okay, look, I have a squid
and you threw up in a wormhole.

13:50.746 --> 13:51.997
Things are pretty weird out here

13:52.081 --> 13:54.208
but human connection
is at least one thing I understand.

13:55.042 --> 13:57.086
Okay, shoot.

13:57.711 --> 14:01.674
Whatever happens out there,
I don't wanna let anyone down.

14:04.051 --> 14:04.885
You won't.

14:11.642 --> 14:12.851
What's the second thing?

14:13.435 --> 14:16.063
Oh, don't say anything
annoyingly inspirational.

14:16.146 --> 14:17.106
That makes me nuts.

14:17.189 --> 14:18.732
[laughs] Deal.

14:19.400 --> 14:22.236
[computer speaking indistinctly]

14:28.242 --> 14:33.789
As requested, I've completed my analysis,
and all crew members are physically sound.

14:34.874 --> 14:37.751
-You did not say "healthy."
-Correct.

14:39.628 --> 14:40.462
But?

14:42.590 --> 14:44.341
Stress hormone levels are off the charts.

14:44.425 --> 14:47.052
If they were mice in a cage,
they'd be gnawing at their own tails.

14:48.012 --> 14:49.597
So would you, by the way.

14:49.680 --> 14:52.641
My tail and I appreciate
your concern, doctor.

14:53.642 --> 14:57.354
However, I need to know
how I can help this crew.

14:57.855 --> 15:02.318
Perhaps a focus on duties or routine?

15:02.902 --> 15:05.821
Under any other circumstances,
those things might be helpful...

15:07.114 --> 15:08.699
but we're in uncharted territory...

15:09.491 --> 15:10.451
and they know it.

15:11.118 --> 15:13.621
<i>Discovery</i> could disappear tomorrow,
and it wouldn't make a ripple.

15:14.079 --> 15:16.081
No one would miss us or mourn us.

15:16.832 --> 15:20.377
-They need to feel connected.
-Yes.

16:01.502 --> 16:02.586
[Vos] Welcome to Trill.

16:03.212 --> 16:05.965
May I present Guardian Xi
of our spiritual community,

16:06.048 --> 16:07.216
and Leader Pav.

16:08.133 --> 16:12.513
Thank you. I'm Commander Michael Burnham,
and this is Adira.

16:14.807 --> 16:17.643
Your captain said that you'd be bringing
a symbiont and host.

16:18.018 --> 16:18.852
Yes.

16:23.023 --> 16:24.191
She is...

16:26.860 --> 16:27.736
human?

16:29.279 --> 16:30.114
Yeah.

16:30.739 --> 16:32.574
Uh, she is.

16:40.457 --> 16:41.291
Please...

16:42.626 --> 16:43.794
speak your names.

16:45.129 --> 16:46.088
Um...

16:47.423 --> 16:48.257
Adira.

16:50.926 --> 16:54.096
-Continue.
-That's it. That's my name.

16:54.179 --> 16:56.557
-Adira.
-[Xi] You recall no other names?

16:57.516 --> 16:58.350
Well...

16:58.434 --> 17:00.519
I know Senna Tal, I guess.

17:01.103 --> 17:03.856
She's unable to access the memories
of her symbiont.

17:04.982 --> 17:05.858
That's why we've come.

17:05.941 --> 17:09.028
[Vos] In 2,000 years, there hasn't been
a single recorded instance

17:09.111 --> 17:12.656
of a successful joining between
a symbiont and a non-Trill species.

17:13.157 --> 17:16.285
-It's a miracle this symbiont is alive.
-I wouldn't let it die.

17:17.327 --> 17:18.370
It's a part of me.

17:19.288 --> 17:21.081
It's a part of you?

17:22.124 --> 17:24.752
-She has no idea, none.
-Why don't you give us an idea?

17:24.835 --> 17:27.880
She's an abomination.
They must be separated immediately.

17:27.963 --> 17:30.424
We cannot.
Forced separation could kill the host.

17:30.507 --> 17:33.886
Oh, no. No one is forcing anything.

17:33.969 --> 17:37.389
We are not Federation members.
You have no jurisdiction here.

17:37.723 --> 17:41.810
-Trill law takes precedence.
-Adira's life takes precedence.

17:43.645 --> 17:44.813
Our apologies.

17:46.231 --> 17:48.192
Every Trill longs to be a host.

17:48.901 --> 17:50.527
Few ever receive the honor.

17:51.070 --> 17:55.824
The Burn decimated our population,
particularly those capable of joining.

17:57.451 --> 17:59.411
We no longer have enough viable hosts.

18:00.913 --> 18:02.414
Adira could be our future.

18:03.749 --> 18:06.794
-If we could look beyond the Trill.
-Absolutely not.

18:06.877 --> 18:10.130
Let us take Adira to the Caves of Mak'ala,
where her symbiont

18:10.214 --> 18:13.550
-might be able to communicate.
-She will contaminate a sacred space.

18:13.634 --> 18:15.511
-The symbiont is not hers.
-Enough.

18:17.471 --> 18:21.183
We've never forced a separation,
we will not start now.

18:22.017 --> 18:26.480
However, I agree that the joining
is an aberration.

18:26.563 --> 18:29.441
From what I'm hearing,
this joining is a miracle.

18:30.109 --> 18:31.819
Maybe the symbiont made the choice.

18:32.736 --> 18:38.200
The memories that she's carrying
can help heal the entire Federation,

18:38.283 --> 18:41.829
and Senna Tal wanted us
to receive his message.

18:44.915 --> 18:48.210
The longer she stays,
the greater the challenge

18:48.293 --> 18:51.296
to the only thing our species have left...

18:52.089 --> 18:53.507
our ideals.

18:54.007 --> 18:56.051
My decision is final.

18:56.135 --> 18:58.720
You will leave Trill immediately.

19:21.451 --> 19:22.286
So, that's it?

19:22.870 --> 19:24.538
They're just kicking us off their planet?

19:31.378 --> 19:33.922
Don't say anything else.
This isn't the way to our shuttlecraft.

19:43.932 --> 19:45.726
The symbiont belongs with us.

19:45.809 --> 19:49.021
It is a part of her.
It is not your choice.

19:49.104 --> 19:50.856
I'm making it my choice.

19:58.322 --> 19:59.281
Where are the caves?

20:01.158 --> 20:02.075
-Never.
-Fine.

20:05.162 --> 20:05.996
Um...

20:07.206 --> 20:09.875
That... wasn't Federation protocol.

20:11.335 --> 20:12.711
No, it wasn't.

20:13.545 --> 20:15.047
-They'll be fine.
-Michael.

20:16.089 --> 20:17.341
Wait, please.

20:19.218 --> 20:21.220
Our society is on the brink of collapse.

20:22.095 --> 20:24.598
Helping you gives us a fighting chance.

20:26.642 --> 20:27.809
The caves are this way.

20:38.779 --> 20:43.033
[computer] <i>The crew would benefit</i>
<i>from exercise, medication, limited dairy--</i>

20:43.116 --> 20:45.035

<i>therapeutic coloring books,</i>

20:49.957 --> 20:51.250

20:51.333 --> 20:54.503
I do not need an endless list
of activities.

20:54.586 --> 20:58.548
I-- I need something meaningful
to heal my crew.

20:59.341 --> 21:00.842
[trilling]

21:05.889 --> 21:06.723
Computer?

21:06.807 --> 21:07.975

21:09.184 --> 21:10.644

21:35.794 --> 21:39.047

are beyond the algorithm, I presume.

21:39.131 --> 21:42.175

21:45.345 --> 21:46.930

21:47.556 --> 21:48.432
The night off?

21:49.182 --> 21:51.351

21:51.727 --> 21:53.687
<i>A private meal, perhaps,</i>

21:53.770 --> 21:57.607

<i>Your choice, captain.</i>

22:07.576 --> 22:10.370
The Sacred Caves of Mak'ala.

22:22.299 --> 22:23.800
[Burnham] This is incredible.

22:24.551 --> 22:27.554
And you believe that Adira's
symbiont will be able to communicate here?

22:28.388 --> 22:29.723
It's their ancestral home.

22:30.348 --> 22:31.975
If not here, then where?

22:35.520 --> 22:36.396
It feels...

22:38.065 --> 22:38.899
safe.

22:41.693 --> 22:42.903
We don't have much time.

22:43.028 --> 22:44.863
Vos will awaken
and the commission will see

22:44.946 --> 22:46.114
that your ship is still here.

22:47.157 --> 22:48.158
Okay, are you ready?

22:48.909 --> 22:50.452
Say something inspirational.

22:51.620 --> 22:53.538
Just don't make it annoying.

22:54.581 --> 22:57.167
Uh, get in there before someone shoots us?

22:59.669 --> 23:00.754
Okay.

23:04.549 --> 23:06.301
Friends, please, come in, come in.

23:07.511 --> 23:08.762
Uh, sit, please.

23:15.018 --> 23:18.647
[Saru] I gave the rest of the crew
the evening off to recuperate.

23:19.356 --> 23:23.985
But I asked all of you here
because we work most closely,

23:24.528 --> 23:26.113
and have not had a moment.

23:27.030 --> 23:29.366
In fact, we have lost quite a few.

23:31.034 --> 23:36.748
Almost every culture has a ritual
that gathers its moments when it can,

23:37.499 --> 23:38.542
holds them dear.

23:39.543 --> 23:43.171
A time to take the measure of loved ones

23:43.255 --> 23:46.007
and what we have
all accomplished together.

23:46.258 --> 23:47.134
[squish]

23:47.926 --> 23:49.052
Ah.

23:52.222 --> 23:53.056
Hm.

23:54.432 --> 24:00.230
We made a choice a millennium ago
to follow Commander Burnham.

24:00.814 --> 24:04.025
I will never forget what I heard
as I stood before each of you

24:04.484 --> 24:05.861
as you cast your vote.

24:05.944 --> 24:09.489
It was not unlike... a small prayer.

24:10.073 --> 24:12.325
I ask that we repeat that now.

24:12.409 --> 24:14.327
-Must we really?
-Yes, we must.

24:15.203 --> 24:18.123
Lieutenant Detmer,
do you remember what you said?

24:19.833 --> 24:20.750
I said, "Aye."

24:23.170 --> 24:24.004
I said, "Aye."

24:25.547 --> 24:27.549
-Aye.
-Aye.

24:28.175 --> 24:29.384
-Aye.
-Aye.

24:29.926 --> 24:31.553
-Aye, sir.
-Aye.

24:31.636 --> 24:32.470
Aye.

24:33.138 --> 24:35.557
-Aye.
-I never said "Aye..."

24:36.349 --> 24:38.935
but... I'm here.

24:39.019 --> 24:39.978
[clears throat]

24:41.646 --> 24:42.480
Aye.

24:43.148 --> 24:44.065
[all] Aye.

24:52.574 --> 24:56.077
Is there any way the symbiont
was joined with Adira against her will?

24:56.870 --> 24:59.664
A symbiont can't thrive
in an unwilling host.

24:59.748 --> 25:01.875
So, the issue might be with Adira herself.

25:03.543 --> 25:06.421
A repressed memory
related to the joining, perhaps.

25:06.504 --> 25:09.299
Whatever it is, she will need to face it.

25:09.382 --> 25:11.301
[footsteps approaching]

25:12.135 --> 25:15.096
[chuckles] It's not exactly my style.

25:15.680 --> 25:16.514
Please...

25:17.098 --> 25:17.933
enter.

25:31.279 --> 25:33.698
This is as new to us as it is to you.

25:34.199 --> 25:38.286
We cannot know how your brain
will process what you see.

25:41.915 --> 25:47.671
The Mynh'ta Orb will allow us
to track her isoboramine levels.

25:48.296 --> 25:50.757
As long as they are steady, she is safe.

26:11.069 --> 26:13.196
If you find Senna Tal down there...

26:15.031 --> 26:16.658
his message is pretty vital.

26:16.741 --> 26:17.617
I know.

26:21.871 --> 26:23.248
[Burnham] Good luck, Adira.

26:37.679 --> 26:39.222
She is now in communion.

26:45.312 --> 26:47.439
[crackling]

26:48.398 --> 26:50.608
[Linus] Is that droog beetle pie?

26:51.985 --> 26:53.111
[sniffs]

27:00.535 --> 27:03.997
-What is going on between you two?
-I don't know.

27:04.873 --> 27:08.710
-Nothing.
-This reminds me of harvest on Kaminar.

27:09.252 --> 27:11.379
Siranna and I would work from sunup

27:11.463 --> 27:15.925
until after sun fall, gathering
and drying our seasonal kelp crops.

27:16.009 --> 27:19.929
Our family would then dine together
under the full moon.

<i>Kelp dries in the sun</i>
<i>An existential crisis</i>

27:25.310 --> 27:27.270

27:54.756 --> 27:57.884
This is not what I want to hear at dinner.
I mean, who raised you people?

27:57.967 --> 27:59.219
Get Detmer to do one.

27:59.844 --> 28:02.263
-No, no. I don't wanna--
-Come on, try.

28:02.347 --> 28:03.515
-No.
-Try.

for the dinner table.

28:47.934 --> 28:49.519
I wasn't trying to make a joke.

28:51.020 --> 28:54.524
I was back at work
within a few hours of being injured.

28:54.607 --> 28:57.360

near Earth if it weren't for me.

You're not the only one
who moved this ship.

28:59.988 --> 29:02.407
I'm the pilot. We move it.

29:02.490 --> 29:04.117
-I never said it was just me.
-You think

29:04.200 --> 29:07.579
you're the only essential personnel
on this vessel. Look at you.

29:07.871 --> 29:09.956
-It's written all over you.
-Lieutenant.

29:10.039 --> 29:11.499
[Detmer] You wanna fly this monster?

29:11.583 --> 29:16.004
Actually be responsible
for every single person, every single day?

29:16.087 --> 29:18.423
Or do you just wanna be
the when-he-feels-like-it superhero

29:18.506 --> 29:20.008
and have everybody kiss your ass?

29:20.091 --> 29:22.969
The reality is I'm the only one
who can make the jumps.

29:23.052 --> 29:26.765
I flew us into the future.
I landed this ship.

29:26.848 --> 29:30.268
-I landed <i>Discovery.</i>
-Yes, and we barely survived.

29:30.351 --> 29:32.020
Oh, my God. Stop it!

29:32.103 --> 29:33.897
You are both acting like assholes.

29:33.980 --> 29:35.982
-Ensign Tilly.
-Why don't we all just take a breath.

29:36.065 --> 29:38.943
You guys think you have the market
cornered on pain?

29:40.695 --> 29:46.367
All of our sacrifices, all of our
experiences and our work, it matters!

29:46.868 --> 29:49.037
The only way we're gonna get through this
is as a crew.

29:49.829 --> 29:50.914
I have work to do.

29:55.543 --> 29:58.463
You did land this monster.
He should be thanking you.

30:04.427 --> 30:05.470

Well, at least the wine was good.

30:28.827 --> 30:31.329
Her levels are dropping.
I need to get her out.

30:31.412 --> 30:33.248
[guard] Stop.

30:38.378 --> 30:42.507
Guardian Xi, you have betrayed your oath.

30:42.590 --> 30:44.300
He's trying to save your lives.

30:46.177 --> 30:47.095
[groaning]

30:47.178 --> 30:49.222
-What's happening?
-I don't know.

30:49.305 --> 30:51.057
I've never seen anything like this.

30:55.979 --> 30:57.772
-I have to help her.
-You cannot enter.

30:57.856 --> 30:59.566
This girl is all we have.

31:00.483 --> 31:02.360
[Burnham]
Please, we can't let her die in there.

31:05.321 --> 31:06.489
[Pav] Let her in.

31:09.158 --> 31:11.202
[water splashing]

31:13.580 --> 31:14.956
[Burnham] She's gone. Where is she?

31:16.916 --> 31:18.543
Help me with the neural stabilizers.

31:27.510 --> 31:31.055
These will help you commune with her,
but only for a short time.

31:31.139 --> 31:34.475
You have to go and find her
and guide her out.

31:35.602 --> 31:36.644
Hurry, please.

31:41.149 --> 31:42.233
Now.

32:13.431 --> 32:14.265
Adira?

32:16.893 --> 32:18.603
Adira, can you hear me?

32:19.520 --> 32:20.355
Adira?

32:23.858 --> 32:24.692
Adira?

32:26.861 --> 32:27.904
Michael?

32:27.987 --> 32:28.821
Michael.

32:29.322 --> 32:31.407
Did he tell you how to get out?
There's no way out.

32:31.491 --> 32:34.035
-I don't know what I'm supposed to do.
-What have you seen?

32:34.118 --> 32:35.244
Get off me!

32:35.328 --> 32:36.913
-What are those?
-They do that if I stay

32:36.996 --> 32:39.207
-in one place for too long.
-Okay.

32:39.290 --> 32:41.376
[creatures screeching]

32:42.835 --> 32:44.629
-What's happening?
-Have they done that before?

32:44.712 --> 32:47.548
Yeah, they're everywhere.
They keep coming after me.

32:48.633 --> 32:49.759
Let me try something.

32:50.051 --> 32:50.969
What the hell?

32:51.052 --> 32:53.554
[rumbling]

32:54.389 --> 32:56.432
This place is responding to you.

32:56.516 --> 32:58.643
You're here to connect with the symbiont.

33:00.853 --> 33:04.357
And these threads,
they're trying to connect with you.

33:04.440 --> 33:06.693
I don't understand. I--

33:06.776 --> 33:08.236
It's the symbiont.

33:09.821 --> 33:11.990
It-- It wants you to remember.

33:12.073 --> 33:14.492
And these threads,
they must be connected to your memories.

33:14.575 --> 33:17.745
I know you're afraid,
but you have to let them connect with you.

33:18.663 --> 33:19.497
Okay.

34:04.042 --> 34:05.168
[man] <i>Surgery Bay Twelve.</i>

34:08.004 --> 34:08.838
Hold my hand.

34:13.468 --> 34:18.765
When this is all over,
after you and the symbiont have joined,

34:18.848 --> 34:20.183
will you still be you?

34:20.600 --> 34:22.226
Of course I'll still be me.

34:25.438 --> 34:27.106
I will always be the Gray you know

34:27.190 --> 34:28.316
-and love.
<i>-I love you, Gray.</i>

34:28.399 --> 34:30.318
-Gray.
-<i>I love you too.</i>

34:30.401 --> 34:31.360
That's his name.

34:32.737 --> 34:34.197
He was my boyfriend...

34:35.323 --> 34:38.534
and we were together on a ship.

34:40.578 --> 34:41.829
[faint laughter]

34:41.913 --> 34:43.289
A generation ship.

34:44.707 --> 34:46.375
He's trying to find
Federation headquarters.

34:47.794 --> 34:50.463
Gray, we both-- We were both orphans.

34:50.546 --> 34:51.714
But we had each other.

34:54.592 --> 34:56.719
-I really loved him.
-Good.

34:57.512 --> 34:59.055
What else do you remember?

35:00.807 --> 35:02.391
He was-- He was Trill.

35:04.769 --> 35:06.104
He was a host,

35:06.354 --> 35:09.315
and I think he was about
to receive his symbiont.

35:11.109 --> 35:12.902
He looked so happy.

35:13.694 --> 35:15.196
Okay. Why aren't you?

35:15.279 --> 35:17.240
I don't know. I don't-- Um...

35:18.950 --> 35:21.786
I'm sorry. I just--
I need to get out of here.

35:21.869 --> 35:23.663
[screeching]

35:24.747 --> 35:26.040
You can't.

35:26.874 --> 35:28.584
Not until you finish remembering.

35:30.837 --> 35:33.381
So, how long were you together,
you and Gray?

35:34.590 --> 35:35.424
Try.

35:37.552 --> 35:38.970
Try to see his face.

36:00.158 --> 36:02.243
[classical music playing]

36:19.302 --> 36:20.511
You not like my playing?

36:21.137 --> 36:22.471
No. I do.

36:26.559 --> 36:30.021
You said you'd be the same
after you became a host.

36:30.104 --> 36:34.483
And all these things you can do now,
it's kind of like you're perfect.

36:34.567 --> 36:37.486
Well, I already was perfect.
That's why you love me.

36:38.446 --> 36:39.322
Okay.

36:39.405 --> 36:42.533
I told you... I'm still me.

36:43.951 --> 36:46.787
I'm just more me.

36:46.871 --> 36:47.872
Which parts?

36:49.498 --> 36:53.502
Like, what's "you"
and what's all the other hosts?

36:57.882 --> 36:59.717
There aren't any fences.

37:00.426 --> 37:02.845
I'm many, and I'm one.

37:04.222 --> 37:05.223
Like everyone.

37:05.848 --> 37:07.767
I feel like I need to keep up.

37:07.850 --> 37:10.728
You're being a crazy person.
It's-- It's not a race.

37:12.772 --> 37:15.233
-I don't think I could do what you did.
-Bullshit.

37:15.650 --> 37:17.485
The Joining's based on trust.

37:18.653 --> 37:21.864
I didn't just have to accept Tal,
Tal had to accept me.

37:21.948 --> 37:24.075
The former hosts had to accept me, too.

37:27.411 --> 37:30.164
Like us. I'd trust you with my life.

37:30.248 --> 37:31.415
Me, too.

37:35.628 --> 37:39.465
You gonna show me what's in that box
on your lap or keep sulking?

37:39.548 --> 37:40.633
Um...

37:41.467 --> 37:47.139
This is a-- A thing that I made for you.

You made it? It's not replicated?

with my own inadequacies

while I'm making amazing art things
that no one in the galaxy can make."

37:58.442 --> 38:00.319
How do you know it's an art thing?

38:04.490 --> 38:06.784
Because we have a love thing, idiot.

38:08.202 --> 38:09.036
And I know you.

38:19.755 --> 38:21.215
No, I-- I need to get out of here.

38:21.299 --> 38:23.676
-Adira.
-Don't touch me.

38:24.760 --> 38:28.014
Okay, the only reason you're here
is to get that message from Senna Tal.

38:28.097 --> 38:30.933
So, do not pretend
like you are doing this for me.

38:32.268 --> 38:33.394
[Burnham] This is for you.

38:33.477 --> 38:34.854
It's for all of us.

38:35.396 --> 38:37.064
We all want a future that's real.

38:38.941 --> 38:39.900
That matters.

38:40.693 --> 38:43.779
If you don't face what this is,
no matter how painful,

38:44.363 --> 38:45.740
you'll never move forward.

39:02.506 --> 39:03.716
Adira!

39:11.640 --> 39:12.475
Adira?

39:13.851 --> 39:16.312

39:53.933 --> 39:55.101
Yeah.

It's a special time for you

than we could ever be alone.

45:26.723 --> 45:27.558
We were wrong.

45:29.476 --> 45:35.441

will impact generations of Trill to come.

45:36.400 --> 45:37.568
Adira Tal...

45:38.735 --> 45:43.323
it would be my honor to guide
and mentor you on your new path.

45:51.790 --> 45:52.624
Thank you.

45:53.750 --> 45:54.585
But...

45:54.877 --> 45:57.379
I believe I'm supposed
to stay with <i>Discovery.</i>

45:59.006 --> 46:02.259
The symbionts are a gift for everyone,
not just the Trill.

46:03.677 --> 46:05.971

I'm supposed to be that messenger.

46:08.891 --> 46:11.935
You will keep us apprised
of your well-being?

46:12.811 --> 46:13.770
Of course.

46:15.230 --> 46:19.193
And perhaps someday,
when the Federation returns...

46:20.194 --> 46:23.322
we will discuss a different joining.

46:25.657 --> 46:26.992
It would be our honor.

Thank you for doing this, sir.

47:12.329 --> 47:14.873
we made a decision together...

47:16.208 --> 47:18.210
and we are living with it together.

47:19.878 --> 47:23.799
The fact that you reminded us of that
and reminded us who we are to each other,

47:23.882 --> 47:24.716
That--

47:25.300 --> 47:27.511
Maybe this isn't my place to say...

47:29.388 --> 47:30.722
but I think that's leadership.

Everything that I've done
since I've been on this ship...

47:50.742 --> 47:53.328
would have been impossible without you.

47:55.205 --> 47:57.791
I've failed to let you know that.

47:59.626 --> 48:00.669
I always knew it.

48:02.796 --> 48:03.964
I failed to tell you.

48:06.258 --> 48:07.092
I apologize.

48:07.968 --> 48:09.261
Thank you. Thank you.

48:11.513 --> 48:15.309
I've been wondering, what did you learn
in your spore-drive research?

48:15.392 --> 48:16.977
Oh, nothing. I was...

48:17.894 --> 48:20.230
looking at dark matter
and energy coefficients,

48:20.314 --> 48:22.107
but the math didn't work, so...

48:24.610 --> 48:28.572
A new interface using dark matter
would be revolutionary.

48:30.449 --> 48:31.825
We should keep talking about it.

48:34.453 --> 48:35.621
Okay.

48:39.708 --> 48:40.542
[Detmer] Hey.

48:48.508 --> 48:49.635
[clears throat]

48:50.260 --> 48:51.136
Are you okay?

48:54.598 --> 48:55.432
No.

48:56.767 --> 48:57.601
Obviously.

49:03.273 --> 49:04.566
That was hard for me to admit.

49:07.069 --> 49:07.944
For anyone.

49:09.738 --> 49:10.739
And you're a pilot.

49:12.240 --> 49:14.326
-Pilots are, um...
-Macho.

49:15.619 --> 49:16.703
I know.

49:19.623 --> 49:22.751
That talk you suggested...

49:24.211 --> 49:25.879
maybe I could take you up on it.

49:28.090 --> 49:28.965
Anytime.

49:34.012 --> 49:38.016
[computer] <i>All available crew, please</i>
<i>report to the shuttle bay for a surprise.</i>

49:43.939 --> 49:45.941
[upbeat music playing]

49:47.150 --> 49:48.777
[crew laughing]

49:55.701 --> 49:56.910
Okay, okay.

50:23.103 --> 50:24.104
It fills the room.

50:25.772 --> 50:26.606
Joy?

50:28.108 --> 50:31.069
Yeah. We all had to stop pretending
we were fine first.

50:33.196 --> 50:34.781
We are not, are we?

50:36.366 --> 50:37.576
How could we be?

50:39.619 --> 50:40.871
But we'll get there.

50:41.621 --> 50:42.789
And you pushed us closer.

50:43.248 --> 50:45.041
Ah. It was not pretty.

50:46.209 --> 50:47.127
It never is.

50:51.047 --> 50:52.257
Good choice, captain.

50:54.217 --> 50:55.969
I wish I could take credit, doctor.

50:57.095 --> 50:58.054
This wasn't you?

51:00.849 --> 51:02.058
I have a theory.

51:03.101 --> 51:06.688
The sphere data was transmitted here
for us to protect it.

51:07.397 --> 51:09.149
It lives on within <i>Discovery.</i>

51:09.733 --> 51:13.069
As we are now inextricably connected,

51:13.653 --> 51:17.324
perhaps now it desires to protect us.

51:32.964 --> 51:35.967
Senna knew the algorithm we need
to find Federation headquarters.

51:36.051 --> 51:37.719
I already did the math.

51:42.474 --> 51:45.310
-These coordinates--
-They'll take you where you need to go.

51:49.731 --> 51:50.565
Thank you.

51:59.199 --> 52:01.701
[playing classical music]

52:08.416 --> 52:09.292
That's beautiful.

52:12.170 --> 52:15.298
-What is it?
-It's a lullaby.

52:16.925 --> 52:19.427
I think Senna Tal's parents
used to sing it to him

52:19.511 --> 52:20.720
when he was a kid.

52:22.180 --> 52:24.641
All the hosts,
their memories are still coming to me.

52:26.685 --> 52:28.186
I expect it'll take a while.

52:45.203 --> 52:47.122
[Gray] Your bowing could use some work.

52:48.665 --> 52:51.793
You're gonna insult my musical ability
for the rest of my life?

52:54.337 --> 52:56.506
You didn't tell her about me.

52:59.843 --> 53:01.845
I'm not sure she'll believe me.

53:03.096 --> 53:04.097
I'm pretty sure she will.

53:06.516 --> 53:07.684
How are you here?

53:10.353 --> 53:11.271
I don't know.

53:13.648 --> 53:15.483
How's this supposed to work?

53:15.567 --> 53:16.693
I don't know.

53:20.363 --> 53:21.197
But...

53:21.781 --> 53:22.699
like I said...

53:24.534 --> 53:27.704
our bowing, we can do better than that.

53:29.122 --> 53:30.457
We'll keep practicing.

53:53.688 --> 53:55.649
