07:09.304 --> 07:11.723
and you don't have

07:09.304 --> 07:11.723
to go to the bathroom..

07:11.765 --> 07:13.141
'...we're gonna take you

07:11.765 --> 07:13.141
on an eye opening'

07:13.183 --> 07:14.642
journey behind the scenes.

07:14.684 --> 07:15.894
That's right, Danny.

07:15.936 --> 07:17.312
Right behind this door

07:17.354 --> 07:19.480
is the control room for

07:17.354 --> 07:19.480
Joe Robbie Stadium's

07:19.522 --> 07:20.857
state of the art

07:19.522 --> 07:20.857
scoreboard.

07:20.899 --> 07:22.984
That's right, Becky.

07:20.899 --> 07:22.984
And we're gonna go inside

07:23.026 --> 07:24.736
and give you

07:23.026 --> 07:24.736
an exclusive peek

07:24.778 --> 07:26.905
at what makes this

07:24.778 --> 07:26.905
computerized marvel tick.

07:31.368 --> 07:33.494
Who would've thought such a

07:31.368 --> 07:33.494
sophisticated piece of machinery

07:33.536 --> 07:36.248
could be run by a simple mop?

07:36.290 --> 07:37.540
Well, Danny, that doesn't seem

07:37.582 --> 07:39.084
to be the correct door,

07:37.582 --> 07:39.084
now. Does it?

07:39.126 --> 07:41.544
No, it doesn't, Becky.

07:39.126 --> 07:41.544
I believe the correct door

07:41.586 --> 07:43.088
would be down

07:41.586 --> 07:43.088
that corridor

07:43.130 --> 07:45.840
where I suggested we go to

07:43.130 --> 07:45.840
in the first place.

07:45.882 --> 07:47.801
Well, Danny, I have

07:45.882 --> 07:47.801
a suggestion where you can go

07:47.842 --> 07:50.595
but first let's go back

07:47.842 --> 07:50.595
to Al, Dan, and Frank.

07:51.679 --> 07:54.433
Oh...terrific job, Beck.

07:54.474 --> 07:57.144
You see, when she smiles

07:54.474 --> 07:57.144
she lights up a whole..

07:57.185 --> 07:58.728
Where are all of the sweaty

07:57.185 --> 07:58.728
football guys!

07:58.770 --> 07:59.938
Bring on the football guys.

07:59.980 --> 08:02.023
The guys that

07:59.980 --> 08:02.023
throw the thing..

08:02.065 --> 08:03.358
Yes, what?

08:03.400 --> 08:06.527
Uncle Jesse, this whole trip

08:03.400 --> 08:06.527
is totally bogus.

08:06.569 --> 08:07.862
I know, Michele,

08:06.569 --> 08:07.862
but Joey's obsessed

08:07.904 --> 08:09.239
with this football stuff.

08:09.281 --> 08:10.949
You think I wanna be

08:09.281 --> 08:10.949
here with a bunch of

08:10.991 --> 08:13.493
loudmouthed, pea-brained

08:13.534 --> 08:16.288
know-it-all jocks who could, uh

08:16.330 --> 08:18.457
who could.. Who could

08:16.330 --> 08:18.457
take this pool cue

08:18.498 --> 08:21.542
and turn me into a Jess-kebab?

08:21.584 --> 08:22.919
Michelle, uh, run along.

08:22.961 --> 08:25.964
You-you don't

08:22.961 --> 08:25.964
want to be privy to this.

08:26.006 --> 08:28.842
Michelle, what is the

08:26.006 --> 08:28.842
probability of our science club

08:28.883 --> 08:32.095
actually doing something

08:28.883 --> 08:32.095
science-related?

08:32.137 --> 08:35.307
Yeah. Let's do

08:32.137 --> 08:35.307
something scientific.

08:35.349 --> 08:38.435
Besides, we're out of quarters.

08:38.477 --> 08:41.896
Let's ask your

08:38.477 --> 08:41.896
Uncle Slick for more.

08:41.938 --> 08:44.399
Now might not be

08:41.938 --> 08:44.399
a good time.

08:44.441 --> 08:47.527
Gentlemen...I hate to bother you

08:47.568 --> 08:51.448
but I-I seem to be losing all

08:47.568 --> 08:51.448
feeling b-below my hairline.

08:51.490 --> 08:52.782
Oh, good! That's better.

08:51.490 --> 08:52.782
Thanks.

08:52.824 --> 08:54.075
Good, yeah, thanks.

08:54.117 --> 08:56.619
Hey, Joey, remind me

08:54.117 --> 08:56.619
to kill you later.

08:56.661 --> 08:58.538
Yeah! Yeah! Kill you later.

08:56.661 --> 08:58.538
Great, Jess, sure.

08:58.579 --> 08:59.789
Idiot.

08:59.831 --> 09:02.667
Hey, there's nobody

08:59.831 --> 09:02.667
watching this TV.

09:02.709 --> 09:04.378
Let's turn it

09:02.709 --> 09:04.378
to the science channel.

09:04.419 --> 09:08.006
It's 27. I memorized

09:04.419 --> 09:08.006
the entire cable lineup.

09:09.216 --> 09:10.884
Oh, here's the remote.

09:10.925 --> 09:13.761
- Here we go! It's kickoff time.

09:10.925 --> 09:13.761
- 'Yeah. Yeah'

09:13.803 --> 09:15.096
(man on TV)

09:13.803 --> 09:15.096
'It's a high kick into the wind'

09:15.138 --> 09:17.098
'and it will be taken

09:15.138 --> 09:17.098
at the goal line.'

09:17.140 --> 09:18.933
(female on TV)

09:17.140 --> 09:18.933
'...anything in nature

09:17.140 --> 09:18.933
more fascinating'

09:18.975 --> 09:21.269
'than the mating dance

09:18.975 --> 09:21.269
of the blue-footed..'

09:21.311 --> 09:23.563
[indistinct chatter]

09:23.604 --> 09:25.648
Hey! Who turned the channel?

09:25.690 --> 09:27.901
Yeah, who turned the channel?

09:25.690 --> 09:27.901
I wanna thank him. Thank you.

09:29.152 --> 09:30.362
It's those kids.

09:30.404 --> 09:31.696
That's interesting.

09:31.738 --> 09:34.824
This remote seems to

09:31.738 --> 09:34.824
control all the TVs.

09:34.866 --> 09:36.368
- Get that remote!

09:34.866 --> 09:36.368
- 'Yeah!'

09:36.410 --> 09:38.495
- No, thanks.

09:36.410 --> 09:38.495
- I pass.

09:38.537 --> 09:40.621
Come and get it, fun boys!

09:41.915 --> 09:43.291
(male #2)

09:41.915 --> 09:43.291
Get that little

09:41.915 --> 09:43.291
whippersnapper!

09:43.333 --> 09:45.085
(Joey)

09:43.333 --> 09:45.085
Alright, just

09:43.333 --> 09:45.085
we'll get it back.

09:45.126 --> 09:46.461
'We'll get it back.'

09:46.503 --> 09:48.046
Ha ha ha!

09:48.088 --> 09:49.756
Alright, okay. No harm done.

09:49.797 --> 09:51.383
Alright. I-I'll get the remote.

09:51.425 --> 09:54.010
It's just a little, uh,

09:51.425 --> 09:54.010
kickoff mischief, that's all.

09:54.052 --> 09:56.679
Jess, help me, okay?

09:56.721 --> 09:58.681
- Grrr!

09:56.721 --> 09:58.681
- I-I-I'm sorry, Weeb. Sorry.

09:58.723 --> 10:01.476
You had a piece of, a lint

09:58.723 --> 10:01.476
on one of your neck rolls.

10:01.518 --> 10:04.396
I got it. I got it.

10:01.518 --> 10:04.396
Fine. I got it.

10:04.438 --> 10:06.440
Jess, help me get it

10:04.438 --> 10:06.440
behind here, alright.

10:06.481 --> 10:07.648
Okay.

10:07.690 --> 10:09.359
- Yeah..

10:07.690 --> 10:09.359
- There it is. There it is.

10:09.401 --> 10:11.736
[whirring]

10:14.114 --> 10:16.491
(male #3)

10:14.114 --> 10:16.491
'Oh, man!'

10:16.533 --> 10:20.661
I-I-I think I'm gonna

10:16.533 --> 10:20.661
ask them to-to kill you first.

10:20.703 --> 10:23.248
That way I'll be

10:20.703 --> 10:23.248
able to watch.

10:23.290 --> 10:26.042
On the, uh, on the plus side,

10:23.290 --> 10:26.042
I-I found the remote.

10:26.084 --> 10:27.627
[grunting]

10:27.668 --> 10:30.004
Back! Back! This thing

10:27.668 --> 10:30.004
needs batteries or somethin'.

10:30.046 --> 10:31.631
Here, here. You try it.

10:31.672 --> 10:33.758
[instrumental music]

10:37.762 --> 10:39.931
[instrumental music]

10:39.973 --> 10:42.225
[indistinct chatter]

10:42.267 --> 10:43.602
Super Bowl Sunday!

10:43.643 --> 10:45.979
[sobbing]

10:43.643 --> 10:45.979
My biggest day of the year

10:46.020 --> 10:48.731
and you guys

10:46.020 --> 10:48.731
wreck the TVs!

10:48.773 --> 10:50.525
All ruined!

10:52.693 --> 10:54.488
Weeb, Weeb,

10:52.693 --> 10:54.488
Weeb, Weeby.

10:54.529 --> 10:56.323
Weeby, Weeby,

10:54.529 --> 10:56.323
Weebula.

10:56.364 --> 10:58.908
Weeb, Weeb, please,

10:56.364 --> 10:58.908
please, Weeb.

10:58.950 --> 11:02.203
It's-it's okay, Weeby.

10:58.950 --> 11:02.203
It-it's just a silly game.

11:02.245 --> 11:03.871
- Silly game?

11:02.245 --> 11:03.871
- Ooh, oh-oh.

11:03.913 --> 11:07.667
[panting]

11:03.913 --> 11:07.667
I broke 11 bones

11:03.913 --> 11:07.667
playing that silly game.

11:07.708 --> 11:09.419
Oh, wow. Was it painful?

11:09.461 --> 11:11.254
I don't know.

11:11.296 --> 11:13.089
They weren't mine.

11:13.131 --> 11:16.092
Of course, they..

11:13.131 --> 11:16.092
They weren't yours? No.

11:16.134 --> 11:18.553
I-I wish I had

11:16.134 --> 11:18.553
more insurance.

11:22.516 --> 11:24.851
Hey, since you guys

11:22.516 --> 11:24.851
can't watch the game

11:24.892 --> 11:27.854
maybe you'd like to come

11:24.892 --> 11:27.854
to the science museum with us.

11:29.397 --> 11:32.025
That's a real good idea,

11:29.397 --> 11:32.025
sweetheart.

11:33.443 --> 11:35.487
Now we can stuff

11:33.443 --> 11:35.487
and mount these clowns!

11:35.529 --> 11:36.655
- Alright, no stuffing.

11:35.529 --> 11:36.655
- Stuff 'em!

11:36.695 --> 11:38.031
- No mounting.

11:36.695 --> 11:38.031
- No stuffing.

11:38.072 --> 11:39.533
- No mounting.

11:38.072 --> 11:39.533
- No stuffing.

11:39.574 --> 11:40.783
I-I-I, uh..

11:40.825 --> 11:42.619
- I have an idea.

11:40.825 --> 11:42.619
- You do? He does.

11:42.661 --> 11:44.621
- He's got an idea.

11:42.661 --> 11:44.621
- Yes, I do.

11:44.663 --> 11:46.747
[instrumental music]

11:50.585 --> 11:51.878
Deej, hi.

11:51.919 --> 11:53.672
[panting]

11:51.919 --> 11:53.672
How'd your interview go?

11:53.712 --> 11:55.298
I don't know.

11:53.712 --> 11:55.298
I haven't had it yet.

11:55.340 --> 11:56.924
The woman from

11:55.340 --> 11:56.924
the scholarship fund called.

11:56.966 --> 11:59.553
- She's gonna be late.

11:56.966 --> 11:59.553
- Ooh, late.

11:59.594 --> 12:01.429
Late is bad.

12:01.471 --> 12:03.640
- Turn on the tube!

12:01.471 --> 12:03.640
- Let's go!

12:06.434 --> 12:09.145
Watercress sandwiches!

12:06.434 --> 12:09.145
Just like mom's!

12:09.187 --> 12:10.855
Hey! Hey! Those are

12:09.187 --> 12:10.855
not for you.

12:10.897 --> 12:12.940
Deej, don't disturb them

12:10.897 --> 12:12.940
while they're feeding.

12:12.982 --> 12:15.109
Joey, who are these people?

12:15.151 --> 12:17.070
Well, they're here because

12:15.151 --> 12:17.070
they wanna see the game

12:17.111 --> 12:20.031
and, uh, I wanna see

12:17.111 --> 12:20.031
the rest of my life.

12:21.533 --> 12:23.326
Some field trip.

12:23.368 --> 12:25.828
Hey, what are you guys

12:23.368 --> 12:25.828
doing back so soon?

12:25.870 --> 12:29.165
Ask her. She promised us

12:25.870 --> 12:29.165
the museum

12:29.207 --> 12:32.293
but all we've seen is

12:29.207 --> 12:32.293
a lot of wet bar change!

12:33.503 --> 12:36.673
Like this is my idea

12:33.503 --> 12:36.673
of a fun day.

12:36.715 --> 12:39.593
I believe the blame rests

12:36.715 --> 12:39.593
squarely upon the shoulders

12:39.634 --> 12:41.802
of our adult chaperones.

12:43.597 --> 12:45.306
What? Don't blame me. I was, uh

12:45.348 --> 12:48.101
I was just tryin' to help out

12:45.348 --> 12:48.101
football-brain over there.

12:48.142 --> 12:50.645
Uncle Jesse, we've got

12:48.142 --> 12:50.645
to learn something.

12:50.687 --> 12:53.732
After all, the motto

12:50.687 --> 12:53.732
of our science club is..

12:53.772 --> 12:56.693
We've gotta

12:53.772 --> 12:56.693
learn something.

12:56.735 --> 12:58.819
And I will teach you something.

12:58.861 --> 13:00.614
Alright, I mean, after all

12:58.861 --> 13:00.614
you guys are kids

13:00.655 --> 13:02.449
I'm a grownup.

13:00.655 --> 13:02.449
I should know more than you.

13:02.490 --> 13:04.158
But you don't.

13:06.578 --> 13:07.870
Well, I-I know

13:06.578 --> 13:07.870
your parents would have

13:07.912 --> 13:09.247
a lot more spending money

13:09.289 --> 13:11.499
if you were in a crate

13:09.289 --> 13:11.499
on your way to Siberia.

13:13.752 --> 13:15.587
Why don't you teach 'em

13:13.752 --> 13:15.587
to climb the stairs, okay?

13:15.629 --> 13:17.422
My interviewer is gonna be

13:15.629 --> 13:17.422
here any minute.

13:17.464 --> 13:20.258
Please, keep them up there.

13:17.464 --> 13:20.258
Keep them occupied.

13:20.300 --> 13:24.095
And, Joey, Joey, get these

13:20.300 --> 13:24.095
people into the kitchen.

13:24.137 --> 13:26.306
D.J., are you out of your mind?

13:24.137 --> 13:26.306
There's no TV in there.

13:26.347 --> 13:27.848
What are we gonna watch,

13:26.347 --> 13:27.848
the freezer?

13:27.890 --> 13:30.477
[cheering]

13:30.518 --> 13:33.396
Okay, our collage has

13:30.518 --> 13:33.396
antelopes and zebras.

13:33.438 --> 13:35.565
Can you guys think of

13:33.438 --> 13:35.565
any other animals

13:35.607 --> 13:37.024
that travel in packs?

13:37.066 --> 13:38.693
No.

13:38.735 --> 13:41.404
[indistinct chattering]

13:41.446 --> 13:43.156
I mean, yes.

13:45.074 --> 13:46.993
- 'Come on, guys.'

13:45.074 --> 13:46.993
- Who are they?

13:47.034 --> 13:49.663
I think Joey brought

13:47.034 --> 13:49.663
some friends over to play.

13:49.704 --> 13:51.748
Hey, look!

13:49.704 --> 13:51.748
It's that clown again.

13:51.790 --> 13:53.792
[laughing]

13:53.832 --> 13:55.460
Thanks for the second chance,

13:53.832 --> 13:55.460
guys.

13:55.502 --> 13:58.505
That's no clown.

13:55.502 --> 13:58.505
That's my dad.

13:58.546 --> 14:01.257
Well, as you can see,

13:58.546 --> 14:01.257
we finally found the scoreboard

14:01.299 --> 14:02.550
and it's clearly marked

14:02.592 --> 14:04.843
"Authorized personnel only."

14:04.885 --> 14:06.887
Which is exactly

14:04.885 --> 14:06.887
what we are.

14:06.929 --> 14:09.766
So why don't we take an

14:06.929 --> 14:09.766
authorized peek inside, Danny?

14:09.808 --> 14:11.058
This is exciting.

14:12.644 --> 14:13.770
[alarm blaring]

14:13.812 --> 14:16.105
Um...well, I guess

14:13.812 --> 14:16.105
we're not as, uh

14:16.147 --> 14:17.816
authorized as we thought

14:16.147 --> 14:17.816
we were.

14:17.856 --> 14:19.442
So, uh, while we

14:17.856 --> 14:19.442
straighten this out

14:19.484 --> 14:21.027
why don't we

14:19.484 --> 14:21.027
throw it back to you

14:21.068 --> 14:24.405
- Ah, Al, Frank, and Dan?

14:21.068 --> 14:24.405
- Dan.

14:24.447 --> 14:26.658
- I thought you got clearance.

14:24.447 --> 14:26.658
- Your job was clearance.

14:26.700 --> 14:29.160
I made the dinner reservations.

14:29.202 --> 14:31.371
- Oh, oh, oh!

14:29.202 --> 14:31.371
- Uh-oh.

14:33.373 --> 14:35.583
That joker's your dad?

14:35.625 --> 14:38.169
[chuckles]

14:35.625 --> 14:38.169
Uh, no, no. See.

14:38.211 --> 14:40.880
You guys fell for the old

14:38.211 --> 14:40.880
that's-my-dad routine.

14:40.921 --> 14:42.298
Better watch

14:40.921 --> 14:42.298
or I'll get your nose.

14:42.340 --> 14:44.384
Oh, look, there it is.

14:44.425 --> 14:48.346
You lovable lugs are just

14:44.425 --> 14:48.346
too darn easy. Yeah.

14:48.388 --> 14:49.806
Okay, boys,

14:48.388 --> 14:49.806
let's go upstairs.

14:49.848 --> 14:52.141
That was your dad.

14:52.183 --> 14:55.019
Shh! That was also

14:52.183 --> 14:55.019
your mom.

14:55.061 --> 14:56.813
- Shh!

14:58.898 --> 15:02.652
So-so you see, kids,

14:58.898 --> 15:02.652
it's simple science, okay?

15:02.694 --> 15:06.113
I mean if you get the proper

15:02.694 --> 15:06.113
pH balance in your shampoo

15:06.155 --> 15:07.490
when you get to this stage

15:07.532 --> 15:10.076
you see, your scalp

15:07.532 --> 15:10.076
should be what, Derek?

15:10.117 --> 15:13.162
Tingling like

15:10.117 --> 15:13.162
pins and needles.

15:13.204 --> 15:15.582
Precisely. Okay.

15:15.623 --> 15:18.167
Always use the fingertips

15:15.623 --> 15:18.167
to massage in the shampoo

15:18.209 --> 15:19.919
never the butt

15:18.209 --> 15:19.919
of the hand, you see?

15:19.960 --> 15:21.504
Fingertips, yes.

15:19.960 --> 15:21.504
Butt, Derek?

15:21.546 --> 15:23.923
- No.

15:21.546 --> 15:23.923
- 'Correct.'

15:23.964 --> 15:26.509
This concludes our little

15:23.964 --> 15:26.509
scientific presentation.

15:26.551 --> 15:27.968
Kids, what have you

15:26.551 --> 15:27.968
learned today?

15:28.010 --> 15:30.096
That Joey is the smart one.

15:31.472 --> 15:34.475
At least he's watching

15:31.472 --> 15:34.475
the Super Bowl.

15:34.517 --> 15:38.312
Yeah. Who cares

15:34.517 --> 15:38.312
how split ends split?

15:38.354 --> 15:39.647
Today's shot.

15:39.689 --> 15:41.691
Let's go downstairs

15:39.689 --> 15:41.691
and watch the game.

15:41.733 --> 15:43.860
We can watch

15:41.733 --> 15:43.860
Derek's shampoo anytime.

15:43.902 --> 15:46.863
What? Kids, kids, if I can

15:43.902 --> 15:46.863
stress anything, it's condition.

15:46.905 --> 15:49.908
It really is, condition,

15:46.905 --> 15:49.908
condition, condition.

15:52.952 --> 15:54.662
Where's the TV?

15:54.704 --> 15:57.582
And all those guys

15:54.704 --> 15:57.582
with no lives?

15:57.624 --> 16:00.877
Uncle Jesse, you're supposed

15:57.624 --> 16:00.877
to keep them busy upstairs.

16:00.919 --> 16:02.545
I tried, but kids these days

16:02.587 --> 16:04.923
you know, they'll spend

16:02.587 --> 16:04.923
two, three on their homework

16:04.964 --> 16:06.257
but you try to spend

16:04.964 --> 16:06.257
five minutes

16:06.299 --> 16:07.967
on proper scalp maintenance

16:08.008 --> 16:10.428
and-and-and they look at you

16:08.008 --> 16:10.428
like you're some kind of nut.

16:11.429 --> 16:13.347
That's the look.

16:13.389 --> 16:14.432
Uncle Jesse, please

16:14.474 --> 16:16.183
she's gonna be here any minute.

16:16.225 --> 16:17.936
- What am I gonna do with them?

16:16.225 --> 16:17.936
- Take them into the kitchen.

16:17.977 --> 16:19.103
Alright, come on, kids.

16:19.145 --> 16:20.605
You little

16:19.145 --> 16:20.605
beauty school dropouts

16:20.647 --> 16:22.189
follow me into the kitchen.

16:20.647 --> 16:22.189
Right this way.

16:23.524 --> 16:27.153
I seem to have been left

16:23.524 --> 16:27.153
high and not quite dry.

16:28.070 --> 16:29.280
Out, out, out!

16:29.322 --> 16:30.907
Come on, come on, out, out!

16:30.949 --> 16:33.117
- Sit down, sit down!

16:30.949 --> 16:33.117
- Sit down!

16:34.494 --> 16:36.036
Out, out, out!

16:36.078 --> 16:37.580
[knock on door]

16:39.916 --> 16:42.836
Hey, there's a lady out there

16:39.916 --> 16:42.836
with a briefcase.

16:42.877 --> 16:44.337
That's my interview.

16:44.378 --> 16:45.630
Out! Everybody, out!

16:45.672 --> 16:47.089
Out! Out! Joey, get 'em out!

16:47.131 --> 16:49.008
Alright, I know the drill.

16:47.131 --> 16:49.008
Road trip!

16:49.049 --> 16:50.426
Let's go! Come on!

16:50.468 --> 16:52.345
[indistinct conversation]

16:52.386 --> 16:54.722
We're missing the game!

16:54.764 --> 16:56.182
[knock on door]

17:00.854 --> 17:02.104
I-I'll be right there.

17:02.146 --> 17:03.815
Just one second.

17:09.403 --> 17:10.947
Hello. I'm Norma Bedrosian.

17:10.989 --> 17:12.573
Hi. I'm D.J. Tanner.

17:12.615 --> 17:14.116
I parked in back

17:12.615 --> 17:14.116
if that's okay.

17:14.158 --> 17:15.994
Oh, yeah, no problem.

17:16.035 --> 17:17.745
[groaning]

17:17.787 --> 17:20.957
Ah! Would you excuse me

17:17.787 --> 17:20.957
for just one second?

17:25.503 --> 17:27.588
Shut up!

17:27.630 --> 17:30.967
Ahem. Sorry, I just had

17:27.630 --> 17:30.967
to clear my throat there.

17:31.009 --> 17:33.636
- Uh, please have a seat.

17:31.009 --> 17:33.636
- 'Thank you.'

17:37.932 --> 17:40.100
You know, we at the scholarship

17:37.932 --> 17:40.100
foundation are interested

17:40.142 --> 17:42.979
in people who are serious

17:40.142 --> 17:42.979
about their academic careers.

17:43.021 --> 17:44.522
Oh, you and me, both.

17:44.564 --> 17:46.232
Lot of students go out

17:44.564 --> 17:46.232
to school and think

17:46.273 --> 17:48.651
that college

17:46.273 --> 17:48.651
is just one big party.

17:48.693 --> 17:50.444
Oh, no, not me.

17:50.486 --> 17:52.572
I-I don't even think

17:50.486 --> 17:52.572
about partying.

17:52.613 --> 17:54.615
I don't even know

17:52.613 --> 17:54.615
anyone who parties.

17:55.909 --> 17:57.911
Deej, there you are.

17:57.952 --> 18:00.914
Why didn't you tell me

17:57.952 --> 18:00.914
you were having a wild party?

18:00.955 --> 18:02.665
Do I know you?

18:02.707 --> 18:05.209
Oh, you must be

18:02.707 --> 18:05.209
the scholarship babe.

18:06.669 --> 18:09.005
Hey, if you've got

18:06.669 --> 18:09.005
any extra bucks

18:09.047 --> 18:10.506
throw a little cash my way.

18:10.548 --> 18:13.509
I'm gonna graduate

18:10.548 --> 18:13.509
magna-come-and-get-her. Ha!

18:15.386 --> 18:16.888
Who is this young woman?

18:16.930 --> 18:19.933
Oh, I'm D.J.'s best pal.

18:19.974 --> 18:21.183
We're inseparable.

18:21.225 --> 18:24.437
We belong together

18:21.225 --> 18:24.437
like Spam and Tang.

18:24.478 --> 18:26.940
Spam, out.

18:24.478 --> 18:26.940
Out, out.

18:26.981 --> 18:28.441
See ya, Tang.

18:30.192 --> 18:32.278
[indistinct chatter]

18:33.195 --> 18:34.697
Miss Tanner, is it possible

18:34.739 --> 18:37.784
there's a Super Bowl party

18:34.739 --> 18:37.784
goin' on in there?

18:37.825 --> 18:38.993
Uh, no, I-I don't think so--

18:39.035 --> 18:41.537
- 'Touchdown!'

18:39.035 --> 18:41.537
- Yeah!

18:42.747 --> 18:44.164
Yes.

18:44.206 --> 18:45.499
But it's not my party.

18:45.541 --> 18:47.251
I-I don't like football at all.

18:47.293 --> 18:48.878
I'd much rather study.

18:48.920 --> 18:53.132
Football's just so barbaric

18:48.920 --> 18:53.132
and stupid and pointless.

18:53.173 --> 18:56.052
What a shame

18:53.173 --> 18:56.052
because I love football.

18:56.094 --> 18:58.220
As do I.

18:58.262 --> 18:59.555
You didn't let me finish.

18:59.597 --> 19:01.015
If my car hadn't broken down

19:01.057 --> 19:03.267
I'd be watching

19:01.057 --> 19:03.267
the game right now.

19:03.309 --> 19:04.936
Let's cut to the chase,

19:03.309 --> 19:04.936
Miss Tanner.

19:04.978 --> 19:06.186
Your grades are excellent

19:06.228 --> 19:07.688
your essay was superlative.

19:07.730 --> 19:09.649
You got the scholarship.

19:09.690 --> 19:11.776
Mrs. Bedrosian, thank you. I--

19:11.818 --> 19:13.653
I'm sure you'll make us

19:11.818 --> 19:13.653
all very proud, dear.

19:13.694 --> 19:15.738
- Now to the game.

19:13.694 --> 19:15.738
- Right.

19:17.490 --> 19:19.826
Nacho cheese!

19:17.490 --> 19:19.826
You gotta love it.

19:21.285 --> 19:23.704
Any room in here

19:21.285 --> 19:23.704
for another football fan?

19:23.746 --> 19:25.205
- Norma!

19:25.247 --> 19:26.457
What you guys doing here?

19:26.499 --> 19:27.959
Why aren't you at Weeb's?

19:28.001 --> 19:31.004
All because of

19:28.001 --> 19:31.004
Beavis And Butt-head here.

19:31.045 --> 19:32.254
Hey, hey. Don't blame Beavis.

19:32.296 --> 19:34.048
This is all Butt-head's fault.

19:34.090 --> 19:36.676
[imitating Butt-head]

19:34.090 --> 19:36.676
Huh-huh huh-huh huh-huh.

19:36.717 --> 19:39.887
Okay. Okay. Come on.

19:36.717 --> 19:39.887
It didn't work out so bad.

19:39.929 --> 19:42.556
It's a.. It's a great game,

19:39.929 --> 19:42.556
and everyone's having fun.

19:42.598 --> 19:44.558
[indistinct chatter]

19:44.600 --> 19:46.226
Yeah, right.

19:48.312 --> 19:50.648
Well...not everyone.

19:50.690 --> 19:52.566
- I'll get it.

19:50.690 --> 19:52.566
- Yeah, I'll go..

19:52.608 --> 19:54.568
- Excuse me.

19:52.608 --> 19:54.568
- I'll go with you.

19:54.610 --> 19:56.696
No, I'll stay and watch

19:54.610 --> 19:56.696
the rest of the game.

19:59.615 --> 20:02.160
Hey, Michelle.

20:02.201 --> 20:04.829
Hey, listen, you and I have

20:02.201 --> 20:04.829
to have a little talk, okay?

20:06.122 --> 20:08.207
I'm sorry. I know you're

20:06.122 --> 20:08.207
a little disappointed

20:08.248 --> 20:10.543
about not going

20:08.248 --> 20:10.543
to the science museum today.

20:10.584 --> 20:12.879
A little disappointed?

20:12.920 --> 20:14.254
I was a little disappointed

20:14.296 --> 20:16.382
when they stopped

20:14.296 --> 20:16.382
making the McRib.

20:16.423 --> 20:18.551
Right now,

20:16.423 --> 20:18.551
I'm a lot disappointed.

20:20.053 --> 20:21.303
Okay, a lot disappointed.

20:21.345 --> 20:22.680
Okay, I can deal with that.

20:22.722 --> 20:24.515
Alright.

20:24.557 --> 20:25.975
I know.

20:26.893 --> 20:28.061
[sighs]

20:28.102 --> 20:30.104
Michelle..

20:30.146 --> 20:32.565
...sometimes things

20:30.146 --> 20:32.565
don't always work out

20:32.606 --> 20:34.233
the way you planned.

20:34.274 --> 20:37.070
You're just gonna have to

learn how to handle that.

20:37.111 --> 20:38.821
Do you understand,

20:37.111 --> 20:38.821
sweetheart?

20:38.863 --> 20:42.200
I think so, like if someone

20:38.863 --> 20:42.200
wanna watch the Super Bowl

20:42.241 --> 20:44.160
but promised

20:42.241 --> 20:44.160
to do something else

20:44.202 --> 20:46.328
they should learn

20:44.202 --> 20:46.328
how to handle that?

20:46.370 --> 20:49.207
Ooh. This little lesson

20:46.370 --> 20:49.207
just took an unexpected turn.

20:49.248 --> 20:50.332
[sighs]

20:51.792 --> 20:54.336
Yeah, I guess I was

20:51.792 --> 20:54.336
a little selfish, huh?

20:54.378 --> 20:55.421
I guess so.

[dramatic music]

20:56.964 --> 20:58.799
Oh, boy. I ruined your day.

20:58.841 --> 21:00.300
I ruined everyone's day

20:58.841 --> 21:00.300
just 'cause I was

21:00.342 --> 21:03.303
obsessed about, uh,

21:00.342 --> 21:03.303
silly old football game.

21:03.345 --> 21:06.682
I don't get it. What's the

21:03.345 --> 21:06.682
big deal with the Super Bowl?

21:06.724 --> 21:08.642
Well, it's exciting. It's fun.

21:08.684 --> 21:11.854
It's the biggest day

21:08.684 --> 21:11.854
of aerosol cheese consumption

21:11.896 --> 21:13.606
in the world.

21:14.774 --> 21:17.693
Uh, but that's no excuse.

21:17.735 --> 21:20.947
The most important thing

21:17.735 --> 21:20.947
is keeping a promise..

21:20.988 --> 21:22.406
I apologize, Michelle.

21:22.448 --> 21:23.699
I'm sorry.

21:25.118 --> 21:27.120
Hey, look, let's forget

21:25.118 --> 21:27.120
about the Super Bowl.

21:27.161 --> 21:28.746
If we hurry, we can

21:27.161 --> 21:28.746
get over to the museum

21:28.788 --> 21:30.289
and learn about the atom

21:30.330 --> 21:33.417
and still have time

21:30.330 --> 21:33.417
to make fun of Einstein's hair.

21:33.459 --> 21:36.129
Thanks, Joey, but I think

21:33.459 --> 21:36.129
it's too late.

21:36.170 --> 21:38.631
Maybe we can go next week.

21:38.672 --> 21:40.049
Deal.

21:40.091 --> 21:41.467
Early in the morning?

21:41.508 --> 21:42.802
Sure, why not?

21:42.843 --> 21:44.428
For the whole day?

21:44.470 --> 21:46.430
Till they throw us out.

21:46.472 --> 21:49.600
Good. I think we understand

21:46.472 --> 21:49.600
each other now.

21:49.642 --> 21:51.269
I think so.

21:51.310 --> 21:55.022
But later tonight I want you

21:51.310 --> 21:55.022
to think about our little talk.

21:55.064 --> 21:56.232
I'll be thinking.

21:57.150 --> 21:58.484
- 'Touchdown!'

21:57.150 --> 21:58.484
- 'Yeah!'

21:58.525 --> 21:59.777
[cheering]

21:59.819 --> 22:02.238
Ooh, boy, that sounded

21:59.819 --> 22:02.238
like a big play.

22:03.697 --> 22:05.449
Well, it is the Super Bowl.

22:06.867 --> 22:09.203
- What are we waiting for?

22:06.867 --> 22:09.203
- Let's go! Come on!

22:09.245 --> 22:11.622
It's the Super Bowl.
