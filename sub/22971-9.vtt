00:17.142 --> 00:19.310
Steve, take out the trash.

00:19.394 --> 00:21.062
I'm doing homework!

00:21.146 --> 00:23.773
I can hear the game on the TV!

00:23.857 --> 00:28.153
Fine! Stupid bag.

00:29.070 --> 00:30.071
Mom...

00:30.155 --> 00:32.115
Homework. I'll do it. Okay.

00:32.198 --> 00:33.199
Palchuk...

00:33.283 --> 00:35.035
...your mother doesn't deserve
that attitude.

00:35.118 --> 00:38.496
- Whatever, Coach.
- Hey, this is new to both of us.

00:38.580 --> 00:40.540
But just 'cause your dad's
no longer in this house

00:40.623 --> 00:42.876
doesn't mean his hostility has to be.

00:42.959 --> 00:45.754
Look, things are gonna be different now.

00:45.837 --> 00:47.756
I'm here if you wanna hug it out.

00:48.757 --> 00:50.133
Hug this.

00:52.927 --> 00:54.054
Have it your way.

00:57.140 --> 00:57.974
Stupid.

01:01.311 --> 01:03.354
Raccoons.

01:18.036 --> 01:21.956
Come out, come out, wherever you are.

01:45.355 --> 01:47.482
What... are you?

01:49.109 --> 01:52.654
Up high, Pal-champ!
That goal you scored in the game...

01:52.737 --> 01:55.490
Okay, let's talk about it later.

01:55.573 --> 01:57.158
- Think so?
- Should work out.

01:57.242 --> 01:59.369
So you cheaters don't turn in a fake,

01:59.452 --> 02:02.997
personalize your babies
to begin the joy of parenting.

02:03.081 --> 02:04.582
I'm kinda worried.

02:04.666 --> 02:10.170
Toby, I really need to pass this class,
or else I lose my mascot position.

02:10.255 --> 02:12.298
Don't worry. We're Team Darby.

02:12.382 --> 02:14.425
We got this. I'm great with kids.

02:16.427 --> 02:18.972
Good of you to join us, Palchuk.

02:19.055 --> 02:22.475
Sorry I'm, uh, late, Coach.
Things got a little weird.

02:22.559 --> 02:24.144
It's about to get weirder.

02:24.227 --> 02:26.271
You're raising a baby with Pepperjack.

02:26.354 --> 02:27.647
What?

02:27.730 --> 02:28.898
Ugh!

02:29.482 --> 02:31.818
Hey, Pepperjack, listen.

02:31.901 --> 02:35.530
Didn't you say one time,
like, you saw, uh, monsters?

02:35.613 --> 02:39.826
If you're gonna shove me in a locker,
just get it over with.

02:39.909 --> 02:43.413
What are you doing?
Seriously, I need to talk to you.

02:43.496 --> 02:44.747
- Palchuk!
- What?

02:44.831 --> 02:48.334
I was just talking about the assignment
with my new partner.

02:48.418 --> 02:50.420
Right, buddy?

02:50.503 --> 02:53.756
Just because we share a roof doesn't
mean you can waltz in late like that.

02:53.840 --> 02:56.134
- Won't let it happen again, Coach.
- Good.

02:56.217 --> 02:57.427
Seriously...

02:57.510 --> 02:59.137
By the way, stopping by the store later.

02:59.220 --> 03:02.223
Want me to pick up more of those
extra-strength pimple pads that you use?

03:04.267 --> 03:07.562
Yeah, that'd be great. Bye, Coach.

03:08.104 --> 03:11.274
Wait. Coach Lawrence is dating your mom?

03:11.357 --> 03:14.819
If one word ever slips your lips,

03:14.903 --> 03:17.864
I swear you'll spend
the rest of your life in there.

03:18.364 --> 03:19.574
Never mind.

03:19.657 --> 03:23.244
I need to know, are monsters real?

03:25.413 --> 03:28.166
I'm coming to your house.
I need to show you something.

03:28.249 --> 03:30.376
But... what do we name our baby?

03:30.460 --> 03:31.794
I don't give a flip!

03:37.508 --> 03:38.968
Oopsie.

03:39.052 --> 03:41.179
My mistake.

03:41.262 --> 03:45.266
You think I am not wise
to your schemes, impure?

03:45.350 --> 03:49.854
After a thousand years at Gunmar's side,
you will not replace me as counsel.

03:49.938 --> 03:54.859
Oh, really?
Because I believe I already have.

03:54.943 --> 03:56.903
And once the vicious one realizes

03:56.986 --> 04:00.573
he has no further use
for an old, blind troll...

04:00.657 --> 04:01.866
I... Well...

04:04.786 --> 04:08.373
Well, what? You know I can't see.

04:08.456 --> 04:12.543
Oh. I moved my thumb across my throat.

04:12.627 --> 04:17.839
- It is, as we say, a killing motion.
- You dare threaten me?

04:17.923 --> 04:21.094
When I inform my Dark Lord
of this treachery,

04:21.177 --> 04:23.388
it will be he who will kill you.

04:23.471 --> 04:28.935
And let me be the first to say,
I will enjoy every minute of...

04:29.727 --> 04:32.897
Oh. You're no longer here, are you?

04:33.773 --> 04:38.403
I am no longer safe here.
I must leave this place at once.

04:39.153 --> 04:42.907
Okay, Flip, here are some
ground rules to my room.

04:42.991 --> 04:45.285
No crying, no making messes...

04:45.368 --> 04:46.536
...and definitely no...

04:46.619 --> 04:50.790
Eli, you have a visitor.
Shall I add another table setting?

04:50.873 --> 04:54.419
- No, Mom, he's just here for school.
- It's really no bother.

04:54.502 --> 04:56.921
It's great to finally meet
a friend of yours.

04:57.005 --> 05:00.091
He's not a friend!
Just send him to my room!

05:00.174 --> 05:02.218
Elijah Leslie Pepperjack!

05:02.302 --> 05:06.222
Send him to my room, please.

05:10.977 --> 05:14.355
"Leslie"? Guess we both have a secret.

05:14.939 --> 05:18.067
So I know us being partners isn't ideal,

05:18.151 --> 05:21.029
but I worked out a parenting schedule
to limit our interaction.

05:21.112 --> 05:22.280
Shut up, Pepperjack.

05:23.656 --> 05:24.866
And tell me...

05:25.700 --> 05:27.118
what this is.

05:27.660 --> 05:28.995
Ah!

05:54.645 --> 05:56.689
"C" is for "cow."

05:58.316 --> 05:59.901
"Z" is for "zebra."

06:00.568 --> 06:04.822
- You... You caught one?
- Caught what? Do you know what this is?

06:04.906 --> 06:07.366
I'm not super smart like you,
but this isn't normal, right?

06:09.619 --> 06:12.121
- You caught one! Incredible!
- "P" is for "porcupine."

06:12.205 --> 06:14.999
- "D" is for "dog."
- Okay, yeah, so you've seen one of these?

06:15.083 --> 06:17.210
- It's a creeper.
- Creeper?

06:17.293 --> 06:21.464
Things that creep in the dark. Monsters,
stone creatures, shape shifters.

06:23.257 --> 06:26.385
But monsters aren't real.

06:26.469 --> 06:29.097
You're freaking me out, okay?
Tell me what's going on.

06:29.180 --> 06:30.848
Are you sure you wanna know?

06:30.932 --> 06:34.018
Once you do, there's no going back.

06:38.022 --> 06:39.357
Huh?

06:40.983 --> 06:46.072
For years, I suspected,
and for years, I waited... patiently.

06:46.572 --> 06:50.243
Then, on one fateful night, I saw them.

06:54.789 --> 06:56.249
Saw what?

06:57.917 --> 07:00.503
Arcadia is a hotbed
for supernatural activity.

07:00.586 --> 07:04.382
Some confirmed, some I've yet
to scratch the surface of.

07:05.049 --> 07:09.262
Yes. Right now,
I've got more questions than answers.

07:09.345 --> 07:13.850
But now that we have proof,
so many possibilities are open to us.

07:13.933 --> 07:16.561
What? Are you kidding me?

07:16.644 --> 07:19.564
This is nuts-oid.
Why... why haven't you told anybody?

07:19.647 --> 07:21.941
I did. You shoved me into a locker.

07:22.942 --> 07:24.652
There's a whole other world
beneath our feet

07:24.735 --> 07:26.195
we know nothing about.

07:26.279 --> 07:28.448
Creatures living in shadow...

07:28.531 --> 07:30.575
...monsters living amongst us.

07:30.658 --> 07:32.160
But what do they want?

07:32.243 --> 07:35.955
- Are they friends?
- Or... not friends?

07:36.038 --> 07:37.248
Whatever they are,

07:37.331 --> 07:41.252
someone or something in Arcadia is at
the center of this, covering it up.

07:41.836 --> 07:45.673
Why does no one know? Who's hiding
the creepers from the world?

07:45.756 --> 07:48.676
Whoever it is, they gotta be stopped,

07:48.759 --> 07:51.846
before these things eat our faces
or something.

07:55.099 --> 07:56.476
Who's behind this?

08:00.563 --> 08:04.400
- No, it can't be.
- There could be other Jims.

08:05.860 --> 08:09.280
- "L" is for "lake."
- Jim Lake?

08:09.363 --> 08:11.407
Jim Lake's behind all this?

08:11.491 --> 08:16.287
- No, no, that doesn't make any sense.
- It makes perfect sense.

08:16.370 --> 08:20.541
My nemesis wants to destroy the world.

08:23.711 --> 08:26.464
I don't know, Steve.
I don't like any of this.

08:26.547 --> 08:28.049
I've never stolen anything.

08:28.132 --> 08:31.802
Aw, grow a pair, Pepperjack.
We're not stealing your mom's car.

08:31.886 --> 08:35.681
We're borrowing it for an emergency.
I can't fit the four of us on my Vespa.

08:35.765 --> 08:38.058
I just can't believe
Jim is behind all this.

08:38.142 --> 08:39.434
He's such a good guy.

08:39.519 --> 08:43.523
Mustache back there
told us all we needed to know.

08:43.606 --> 08:47.276
Jim is a shape-shifter
that's leading a creeper army.

08:47.360 --> 08:49.070
He's a maniac that's gotta be stopped.

08:49.153 --> 08:51.322
But why?

08:51.405 --> 08:54.408
Kill Jim. Kill Jim.

08:54.492 --> 08:57.703
Jim would never hurt a soul.
He's the only one nice to me.

08:57.787 --> 08:59.413
"He's the only one nice to me."

08:59.497 --> 09:00.623
It's an act, Pepperjack!

09:00.706 --> 09:04.168
That's what he wants us to believe.
I told you what I saw in the woods.

09:04.252 --> 09:07.964
Jim is a danger to Arcadia,
and Toby and Claire are in on it.

09:08.047 --> 09:10.007
After we take Mustache to the police

09:10.091 --> 09:12.677
and he explains everything to them
on that kiddie talk box,

09:12.760 --> 09:15.471
I can finally expose Jim Fake

09:15.555 --> 09:17.974
and end him once and for all.

09:18.057 --> 09:21.394
- The police? I don't know.
- What the...?

09:21.477 --> 09:24.438
- Why is he spazzing out?
- I don't think he likes your plan.

09:24.522 --> 09:26.232
You sure that cage is secure?

09:26.315 --> 09:29.193
Don't worry. I locked it myself.

09:30.778 --> 09:32.863
Where is it? Where is it?

09:34.282 --> 09:35.616
He's on me!

09:35.700 --> 09:39.412
♪ The wheels on the bus go round
and round Round and round ♪

09:40.830 --> 09:42.415
Jim, your armor.

09:43.499 --> 09:45.835

09:52.008 --> 09:53.551
You think they saw anything?

09:54.719 --> 09:56.470
What is he...?

09:56.554 --> 09:58.055
My mom's pepper spray.

09:58.139 --> 09:59.557
It's for safety.

09:59.640 --> 10:02.602
Why, Mustache? I thought
we were friends.

10:04.103 --> 10:05.563
Apparently not.

10:05.646 --> 10:07.398
He's making a run for it.

Forget your mom.
Without the creeper, where's our proof?

10:31.172 --> 10:33.799
Well... there is one lead left.

10:33.883 --> 10:36.135
Jim.

10:36.218 --> 10:40.973
We'll go straight to the source
and stop evil from where it's born.

10:41.057 --> 10:43.559
Let's go, Pepperjack.
The world needs us.

10:43.643 --> 10:47.855
But what about our assignment?
And what about my mom's car?

10:47.938 --> 10:49.815
I don't give a flip!

10:51.484 --> 10:53.736
Please. Please, changeling.

10:53.819 --> 10:55.821
I need your help. The exit...

10:55.905 --> 10:57.531
Sorry. We aren't allowed to talk to you.

10:57.615 --> 10:59.867
On whose orders? Scaarbach's?

10:59.950 --> 11:03.287
Are you absolutely certain
you have heard nothing from her?

11:03.371 --> 11:06.082
It's been weeks,
and she hasn't spoken a word.

11:06.165 --> 11:07.958
Not since Gunmar's return.

11:08.042 --> 11:11.128
But we need the Pale Lady's guidance
more than ever.

11:11.212 --> 11:13.005
That old relic must be broken!

11:14.632 --> 11:17.676
Nein, nein. We must have faith.

11:18.636 --> 11:23.933
If it is her will, she will find a way
to speak to us again.

11:26.060 --> 11:29.355
My Dark Underlord, I have had visions.

11:29.438 --> 11:33.901
My brother may have stolen my eyes,
but she has blessed me with sight.

11:35.778 --> 11:38.656
Maybe we should think this through
before we kidnap Jim?

11:38.739 --> 11:41.117
I don't think. I act.

11:41.200 --> 11:42.034
Ow!

11:45.538 --> 11:49.834
To conquer this realm,
we must show no mercy!

11:49.917 --> 11:52.962
I'll charge the doors
and tear the men limb from limb!

11:53.045 --> 11:55.297
Careful.
Guards will notice.

11:55.381 --> 11:58.801
That does not matter
if none survive to tell the tale!

11:58.884 --> 12:01.720
I will split them with my axe!

12:01.804 --> 12:05.641
It's a creeper den.
I've never seen so many in one place.

12:05.725 --> 12:07.601
You didn't tell me
they got that big.

12:07.685 --> 12:09.603
Thought they were all like
the little green guy.

12:09.687 --> 12:11.147
How are we supposed to take Jim down

12:11.230 --> 12:13.607
when he's got those rock apes
as bodyguards?

12:13.691 --> 12:14.525
Master Jim.

12:14.608 --> 12:15.818
Do you hear that?

12:15.901 --> 12:18.195
That thing just called him "Master."

12:19.280 --> 12:20.865
Abort! Abort!

12:25.077 --> 12:29.498
- "Killing streak," "conquer," "Master"?
- Get a hold of yourself, Pepperjack.

12:29.582 --> 12:34.670
It's true. Jim is one of them.
This whole time, it's all been a lie.

12:34.753 --> 12:37.256
The greatest guy in the world
is out to destroy it!

12:37.339 --> 12:40.176
I told you he was a fraud.
Why didn't anyone believe me?

12:40.259 --> 12:42.261
He's planning some kind
of creeper invasion.

12:42.344 --> 12:46.432
We gotta call the police,
the military, UN Special Forces!

12:53.481 --> 12:55.065
Look, the rock
show at the museum.

12:55.149 --> 12:58.110
Rock show? What's happening
at the rock show at the museum?

12:58.194 --> 12:59.528
Shh! I'm trying to listen.

12:59.612 --> 13:01.071
A guy found it last week.

13:01.155 --> 13:04.658
- Then we're gonna be there tonight.
- Tonight? It's happening tonight?

13:04.742 --> 13:07.786
I can't hear them
with you yelling in my ear!

13:07.870 --> 13:09.413
Jim, I'm home!

13:09.497 --> 13:12.750
I'll be right up! Just working
on my assignment. Don't come down!

13:13.459 --> 13:14.585
Hmm?

13:20.132 --> 13:21.634
Don't you get it, Eli?

13:21.717 --> 13:25.471
We're the last line of defense.
We have to be the heroes.

13:25.554 --> 13:29.725
If there's no time to call in
the big guns, you must become one.

13:29.808 --> 13:32.269
There's only one thing
I care to know about creepers.

13:32.353 --> 13:33.479
How to kill 'em.

13:34.813 --> 13:37.816
Good thing I've been saving these
for a rainy day.

13:37.900 --> 13:38.734
Whoa!

13:39.568 --> 13:42.029
Whoa, nice. What else you got?

13:42.696 --> 13:44.573
Zip slippers.

13:44.657 --> 13:45.741
Never been worn.

13:45.824 --> 13:49.745
When my mom saw how dangerous they were,
she never let me near 'em.

13:49.828 --> 13:51.330
But not tonight.

13:51.413 --> 13:54.375
Okay, but what do you got
for that shape-shifter Jim?

13:54.458 --> 13:56.585
This'll never be over
until he goes down.

13:59.630 --> 14:03.092
I call this deadly cocktail
"the Last Resort."

14:03.175 --> 14:06.470
It's got every monster deterrent
I could find.

14:06.554 --> 14:10.266
Garlic powder, silver, holy water.

14:10.349 --> 14:12.268
And, in case he's an alien...

14:13.769 --> 14:15.354
human germs.

14:17.231 --> 14:19.400
We don't know what we're gonna be
up against tonight,

14:19.483 --> 14:21.944
so bring everything you can carry.

14:22.027 --> 14:26.448
Sorry, little guy.
This adventure is for grown-ups only.

14:26.532 --> 14:29.660
All you things that creep
in the night, watch out,

14:29.743 --> 14:31.704
because the Midnight Boys are comin'.

14:31.787 --> 14:35.165
We're not calling ourselves
"the Midnight Boys."

14:35.249 --> 14:36.292
Look at us.

14:36.375 --> 14:39.169
Look in the mirror, Eli.
What do you see?

14:41.255 --> 14:42.965
A pair of cool dudes.

14:43.757 --> 14:45.050
We're the Creepslayerz.

14:45.926 --> 14:47.094
With a "Z."

14:47.720 --> 14:49.889
- Ugh. Yeah, Creepslayerz.
- Boo-wap-da-boo!

14:49.972 --> 14:53.142
- I'm so cool. Creepslayerz.
- Boo-wap-da-boo! Da-boo!

14:53.225 --> 14:55.269
Ooh. The Creepslayerz!

14:55.352 --> 14:58.355
- Ooh. The Creepslayerz!
- We should probably go save the world.

14:58.439 --> 15:00.524
Creep-Creep-Creepslayerz.

15:04.486 --> 15:08.407
These rock nerds have no idea this place
is about to be crawling with creepers.

15:08.490 --> 15:10.618
Eli, you get the normies outta here.

15:10.701 --> 15:12.161
Leave Jim to me.

15:20.711 --> 15:23.422
Pardon me, ma'am,
but the museum's closing.

15:23.505 --> 15:25.549
No, the rock show's just begun.

15:25.633 --> 15:27.635
And why on earth
are you wearing a bike helmet?

15:27.718 --> 15:29.470
I don't know. Uh, bye.

15:31.096 --> 15:34.266
Hey. Um, there's a gas leak.

15:34.350 --> 15:36.101
Everyone's gotta get outta here.

15:36.185 --> 15:39.313
What? You don't work here.
Wait, are those ninja stars?

15:39.396 --> 15:44.526
Sorry. I was just trying to, um,
look out for your health.

15:44.610 --> 15:47.821
It's in danger. There's gotta
be a better way to do this.

15:55.120 --> 15:56.789
Adiós, Lake.

15:56.872 --> 15:59.917
I... hope... you... die!

16:00.376 --> 16:03.671
Ugh! Watch where you're go... Steve?

16:03.754 --> 16:05.047
What are you doing here?

16:05.130 --> 16:07.007
- And ugh! What is this?
- What?

16:07.091 --> 16:08.550
Why didn't you...?

16:08.634 --> 16:12.262
I mean, you ruined
my protein shake from...

16:12.972 --> 16:15.849
Forget it! I'm outta here, weirdo!

16:16.767 --> 16:19.144
You've gotta be more aggressive, Eli.

16:19.228 --> 16:21.146
Lives are on the line.

16:22.564 --> 16:24.441
Museum's closed, mister.

16:24.525 --> 16:28.445
If you don't get out of here right now,
there's gonna be big trouble.

16:28.529 --> 16:30.990
Big trouble.

16:33.784 --> 16:36.662
- Big trouble.
- Creepers are here! Creepers are here!

16:36.745 --> 16:37.579
What do I do?

16:37.663 --> 16:39.415
Hold 'em off.
I'll be right there.

16:43.085 --> 16:44.378
How do you kill this thing?

16:45.629 --> 16:47.131
Big trouble.

16:47.214 --> 16:49.174
Leave him alone, buttsnack!

16:49.258 --> 16:53.012
- Buttsnack.
- Get out of the way!

16:53.095 --> 16:54.138
Buttsnack.

16:54.221 --> 16:55.931
Are you okay?

16:56.015 --> 16:59.685
What's that smell? Did it hit you
with some kind of paralyzer venom?

17:00.060 --> 17:03.522
No! I'm covered
in your stupid Last Resort goo!

17:03.605 --> 17:07.067
Didn't work on Jim,
and now I smell like baby vomit!

17:07.151 --> 17:08.569
Could you see that thing?

17:09.236 --> 17:12.406
We're totally underprepared!
We're gonna die here!

17:12.489 --> 17:14.157
We're gonna die!

17:14.241 --> 17:16.993
Get a hold of yourself, Steve!
We're the Creepslayerz!

17:17.077 --> 17:18.704
We gotta slay some creeps!

17:18.787 --> 17:22.915
Now, go clean yourself up. I'll find
a way to handle Jim... somehow.

17:28.005 --> 17:29.923
Come on, Steve, get it together.

17:34.428 --> 17:35.721
No, not again, no.

17:36.930 --> 17:38.140
Not that thing again.

17:39.266 --> 17:41.268
- I know you're still here.
- Jim?

17:42.269 --> 17:44.730
I know you're hungry,
but you have to leave.

17:44.813 --> 17:46.690
I will protect Arcadia.

17:53.322 --> 17:55.574
For the glory of Merlin,
Daylight is mine to command!

18:00.412 --> 18:02.498
Jim's a... good guy?

18:05.876 --> 18:07.669
Buttsnack.

18:15.677 --> 18:18.430
There's too many bystanders here.
Need to evacuate.

18:21.475 --> 18:23.435
- This is not a test.
- What was that?

18:23.519 --> 18:25.312
Please remain calm
and evacuate the building.

18:25.395 --> 18:26.647
Think, Eli. Think.

18:26.730 --> 18:30.359
If the Last Resort didn't get rid
of Creeper Jim, how do you stop him?

18:30.442 --> 18:33.570
Why are you talking to yourself?
You're Elijah Leslie Pepperjack.

18:33.654 --> 18:36.406
You're a Creepslayer. Act like it.

18:36.490 --> 18:40.369
Sorry, Creeper Jim.
Time to knock you out.

18:40.953 --> 18:43.872
- But Toby will never let us use his baby.
- Don't take this the wrong way.

18:43.956 --> 18:45.833
It's just a bag of flour.

18:45.916 --> 18:50.003
I'm telling you, it's the only way
to get rid of that gruesome. Come on.

18:52.631 --> 18:54.842
To think we were about
to take him down...

18:54.925 --> 18:56.468
Oh, no. Eli.

18:56.552 --> 18:58.971
- Tobes, where are you?
- Did you get it?

19:01.390 --> 19:02.224
Stop.

19:02.891 --> 19:04.560
Something happened in the bathroom.

19:04.643 --> 19:07.020
Isn't this something
you should keep to yourself?

19:07.104 --> 19:09.731
No! I think we got it wrong, Eli.

19:09.815 --> 19:11.608
Jim Lake...

19:11.692 --> 19:13.110
is a...

19:13.193 --> 19:14.194
good guy.

19:14.903 --> 19:17.990
I don't understand.
We saw him with the monsters.

19:18.073 --> 19:21.410
I don't know what's going on, and I
don't even know who or what Jim is,

19:21.493 --> 19:23.954
but I think it's pretty clear
we're in way over our heads here.

19:24.037 --> 19:25.330
Maybe you're right.

19:25.414 --> 19:28.292
Let's get outta here
before anything else weird happens.

19:28.375 --> 19:29.668
You know what, Pepperbuddy?

19:29.751 --> 19:32.838
From now on, I should probably
think a little before I act.

19:32.921 --> 19:35.507
And I should think twice
before knocking out a classmate

19:35.591 --> 19:38.177
with a medieval mace
without knowing all the facts.

19:41.513 --> 19:42.347
Buttsnack.

19:46.643 --> 19:51.231
Oh, my gosh. There's no way out.
It's gonna eat our faces.

19:51.315 --> 19:53.525
Why does this keep happening to us?

19:54.943 --> 19:56.153
What do we do?

19:57.196 --> 20:00.699
- We need flour. We need Flip.
- You brought him!

20:00.782 --> 20:02.576
You said the assignment
was important to you.

20:02.659 --> 20:04.328
I shouldered the load.

20:04.411 --> 20:06.205
Shall we do this together, partner?

20:06.288 --> 20:07.706
- Tobes, where is he?
- On three.

20:07.789 --> 20:09.082
- One.
- Two.

20:10.417 --> 20:11.335
Three!

20:17.799 --> 20:19.134
No!

20:19.218 --> 20:21.261
Eli, we did it!

20:22.804 --> 20:23.639
We did it!

20:24.389 --> 20:27.851
- Oh, yeah. We did it. Uh-huh.
- I did it. I did it.

20:28.977 --> 20:31.063
- Creep...
- ...slayerz.

20:32.522 --> 20:35.150
I'm Steve. I did it. I'm so good.

20:35.234 --> 20:38.028
- Oh, yeah, all right. Uh-huh.
- I'm talented, I'm good. Look at me.

20:39.571 --> 20:42.532
- Thanks for the ride.
- That's what Creepslayerz do.

20:42.616 --> 20:43.450
You know, Steve,

20:43.533 --> 20:46.203
no matter what everyone else thinks,
you're not a bad guy.

20:46.286 --> 20:48.622
Neither are you... Leslie.

20:48.705 --> 20:52.000
I kid. Don't worry,
your secret's safe with me.

20:52.584 --> 20:54.670
And I won't tell anyone about Coach.

20:54.753 --> 20:56.588
I appreciate that.

20:56.672 --> 20:58.799
- So the adventure's over.
- For tonight.

20:58.882 --> 21:01.843
Arcadia is still in danger.
Jim might need us.

21:01.927 --> 21:04.012
I can't wait to rub it in his face!

21:05.764 --> 21:07.933
After we figure out
what's really going on.

21:08.016 --> 21:11.103
Good idea. Think before we act,
operate from the shadows,

21:11.186 --> 21:13.814
and strike when Arcadia needs us.

21:13.897 --> 21:16.441
Like secret superheroes. I can dig that.

21:17.067 --> 21:18.944
Stay safe, Eli.

21:19.027 --> 21:21.863
Does this mean we're friends
and you'll be nice to me at school?

21:22.864 --> 21:24.783
Sorry. Gotta keep our cover.

21:25.284 --> 21:26.451
Later, buttsnack.

21:27.369 --> 21:29.621
You're still a turd!

21:30.580 --> 21:32.916
Eli, were you just on a motorcycle?

21:33.000 --> 21:35.085
It's a Vespa, Mom. Now, go to bed!

21:35.168 --> 21:38.755
- Elijah Leslie Pepperjack!
- I'm sorry, Mom.

21:38.839 --> 21:44.428
- I don't know what got into me.
- Wait a minute. Eli, where's my car?

- What is this music?

22:20.088 --> 22:22.382
I can't rap over this.
It has no beat.

22:22.466 --> 22:25.093
- Sounds super serious.
- Hey, look, it's Toby!

22:25.177 --> 22:27.387
- Wait, the dentist gets a picture?
- Hi, Toby!

22:27.471 --> 22:29.931
Who's that? Are they even in the show?

22:30.015 --> 22:32.225
We're probably next. Mm...

22:32.309 --> 22:34.895
- Now! Oh, come on!
- Oh, of course, Claire gets one.

22:34.978 --> 22:36.688
I guess that's how
it's gonna be, Steve.

22:36.772 --> 22:39.274
- What?
- Creepslaying's a thankless job.

22:39.357 --> 22:41.276
What a total rip-off.
