I want you to explain

05:02.666 --> 05:04.041
what I've been saying.

and I have to work
in a slaughterhouse?

05:35.375 --> 05:37.208
What?

I don't want to see it
if it's got willies.

20:59.750 --> 21:02.291
And...

21:02.375 --> 21:04.125
open them.

21:05.166 --> 21:07.833
Oh, my days.

21:07.916 --> 21:09.833
Oh, they're so glamorous.

21:09.916 --> 21:11.458
Who are they for?

21:11.541 --> 21:12.791
Me.

21:13.833 --> 21:14.833
You?

21:15.875 --> 21:17.208
Do you mean to wear?

21:17.291 --> 21:18.458
Yeah.

21:18.541 --> 21:20.541
On your feet?

21:20.625 --> 21:22.083
Uh, no, Pritti, I'm gonna
pierce me nipples

21:22.166 --> 21:23.083
and swing 'em round me tits.

21:23.166 --> 21:25.916
Yeah, on me feet.

21:26.000 --> 21:29.500
Jamie, are you saying, you...

21:29.583 --> 21:31.333
All right, what are you saying?

21:31.958 --> 21:34.291
You remember, right,
when we were little,

21:34.375 --> 21:37.541
and we used to play dress-up

21:37.625 --> 21:40.375
and I'd always be
pre-breakdown Britney?

21:40.458 --> 21:41.750
Well...

21:41.833 --> 21:43.875
for me...

21:43.958 --> 21:47.041
that's a game I don't want
to stop playing.

21:47.125 --> 21:49.083
Dressing up as a woman?

21:49.166 --> 21:51.583
Yeah.

21:51.666 --> 21:53.375
Do you want to be a woman?

21:53.458 --> 21:55.208
Uh, no. I want to be a boy.

21:55.291 --> 21:58.000
Who sometimes
wants to be a girl.

21:59.041 --> 22:00.666
Is it... sexual?

22:00.750 --> 22:02.541
No. It's fun.

22:02.625 --> 22:05.291
It's wonderful.

22:05.375 --> 22:07.208
I want to be a drag queen.

22:07.291 --> 22:09.750
You can do that, you know.

22:09.833 --> 22:12.083
Get instafamous,
make some money.

22:12.166 --> 22:14.083
Just not on Parsons Cross.

22:14.166 --> 22:16.625
Why can't you do it
on Parsons Cross?

22:16.708 --> 22:18.916
Oh, 'cause this is Sheffield,
not San Francisco.

22:19.000 --> 22:22.125
I'm Jamie New
not Bianca Del Rio.

22:23.500 --> 22:25.500
So...

22:27.500 --> 22:30.000
What do you think?

22:32.083 --> 22:34.166
I think...

22:34.250 --> 22:35.208
You think I'm a freak.

22:35.291 --> 22:36.541
No, it's not...

22:36.625 --> 22:38.541
Not a freak. I just...

22:38.625 --> 22:41.166
I do think it's weird. Yeah.

22:41.250 --> 22:42.375
-Chips with that?
-Uh, no, thanks.

22:42.458 --> 22:43.916
I'm watching me waist.

22:44.000 --> 22:45.875
But I guess that's
the point, in't it?

22:45.958 --> 22:47.791
Everyone thinks I'm weird, too.

22:47.875 --> 22:50.166
I'm a Muslim girl
with a Hindu first name.

22:50.250 --> 22:52.000
I mean, thanks, Mum.

22:52.083 --> 22:53.125

to gimme at mosque.

22:53.208 --> 22:54.875
Yeah, Pritti.
Me, being a drag queen,

22:54.958 --> 22:56.708
in Sheffield,
is exactly like that.

22:56.791 --> 22:58.666
I'm just saying,
that's us, in't it,

22:58.750 --> 23:00.000

23:00.083 --> 23:02.041
I don't fit in
'cause I want to be a doctor.

23:02.125 --> 23:04.125
You don't fit in
'cause you want to dress up.

23:04.208 --> 23:05.375
High achiever.

23:05.458 --> 23:06.625
High heels.

23:06.708 --> 23:08.875
-(laughs softly)
-So we're still friends, yeah?

23:08.958 --> 23:11.291
Bezzy friends, #4eva.

23:11.375 --> 23:12.625
Oh, thank God.

23:12.708 --> 23:14.333

23:14.416 --> 23:16.041

23:19.958 --> 23:21.791
-What's gay and says ow?
-I don't know.

23:21.875 --> 23:23.500
Ow! Get lost, Dean.

23:23.583 --> 23:24.833
I've got better things to do.

23:24.916 --> 23:26.750
Oh. And what about you?

23:26.833 --> 23:28.416
You got better things to do,

23:28.500 --> 23:32.500
you fat sweaty, swotty, spotty,
speccy, piggy virgin?

23:32.583 --> 23:33.791
Don't you dare call her that.

23:33.875 --> 23:36.000
Why? It's what she is.

23:36.083 --> 23:38.083
Just like you're
a gay, gay, gay, gay,

23:38.166 --> 23:40.125
gay, gay, gay, gay...

23:41.666 --> 23:43.625

23:43.708 --> 23:45.708
Yeah, Dean, I'm gay.

23:45.791 --> 23:48.000
I am gay.

23:48.083 --> 23:50.500
So if I call me gay,

23:50.583 --> 23:53.666
then being called gay
in't an insult, is it?

23:53.750 --> 23:55.958

23:56.041 --> 23:57.625

24:19.208 --> 24:20.333
You're fearless.

24:20.416 --> 24:22.083
You're Emmeline Pankhurst.

24:23.875 --> 24:25.833

But I don't want to make
people scared of me.

36:11.875 --> 36:14.166
Shoot first, or they'll shoot
you down. First rule of drag.

36:15.208 --> 36:18.041
So why...

36:18.125 --> 36:20.125
why do you want
to be a drag queen?

36:20.208 --> 36:22.291
I dunno, I just do.

36:22.375 --> 36:23.583
You just do.

36:23.666 --> 36:25.625
Oh, that's some inspiring

36:27.333 --> 36:29.375
Bloody hell.

36:29.458 --> 36:33.125
Because I can't really ever
imagine doing anything else.

36:33.208 --> 36:36.416
Because it's all I dream of.

36:36.500 --> 36:39.166
It's all I live for

36:39.250 --> 36:41.583
and when I close me eyes,
it's all I can see.

36:42.625 --> 36:45.166
I don't want to be a drag queen.

36:45.250 --> 36:48.166

37:04.208 --> 37:05.541
What if the other lads
turn on you?

37:05.625 --> 37:07.583

-So...

37:08.625 --> 37:09.958
...you don't think
I should go?

37:10.041 --> 37:11.333

(students gasping, chuckling)

1:09:09.791 --> 1:09:11.291

1:09:11.375 --> 1:09:12.875
Must have overslept.

1:09:12.958 --> 1:09:14.208
Late night.

1:09:14.291 --> 1:09:15.791
No, I'm sorry, Jamie.

1:09:15.875 --> 1:09:17.250
I'm sorry you suddenly
feel the need

1:09:17.333 --> 1:09:18.833
to be the center of attention.

1:09:18.916 --> 1:09:21.500
I don't know what
you're talking about, miss.

1:09:23.583 --> 1:09:25.125
(students laughing, murmuring)

1:09:25.208 --> 1:09:26.666
Miss.

1:09:26.750 --> 1:09:28.458
You know that makeup like that
is completely

1:09:28.541 --> 1:09:30.166
against school uniform rules.

1:09:30.250 --> 1:09:32.458
JAMIE: The school uniform rules
for the girls, miss, yeah,

1:09:32.541 --> 1:09:36.666
but if you check the code
for the boys-- and I did--

1:09:36.750 --> 1:09:38.666
it don't say nothing
about makeup at all.

1:09:38.750 --> 1:09:40.458
Hiya, Dean.

1:09:40.541 --> 1:09:42.458
Having a nice day so far?

1:09:42.541 --> 1:09:43.875
Jamie, what are you doing?

1:09:43.958 --> 1:09:45.083
Who's Jamie?

1:09:45.166 --> 1:09:46.458
I'm Mimi Me.

1:09:46.541 --> 1:09:47.875
HEDGE:
Take them off.

1:09:47.958 --> 1:09:49.125
No.

1:09:49.208 --> 1:09:50.583
(students murmuring)

1:09:50.666 --> 1:09:52.625
What did you just say to me?

1:09:52.708 --> 1:09:55.000
I said, "No."

1:09:55.083 --> 1:09:56.916
I won't take them off.

1:09:57.000 --> 1:10:00.000
Can I remind you that I am
a teacher at this school?

1:10:00.083 --> 1:10:01.875
You don't need
to remind me that, miss.

1:10:01.958 --> 1:10:04.541
I just get a whiff
of desperation, and then, oh,

1:10:04.625 --> 1:10:07.250
-look, there you are.
-(students laughing, murmuring)

1:10:08.250 --> 1:10:10.875
You're in real trouble now. Out!

1:10:10.958 --> 1:10:14.166
(students laughing, chattering)

1:10:16.041 --> 1:10:18.333
Sit down and stay there.

1:10:19.958 --> 1:10:22.208

1:10:25.875 --> 1:10:27.500
Hiya, gorgeous.

1:10:29.000 --> 1:10:30.583
Freak show.

1:10:31.958 --> 1:10:35.000
Freak show, freak show,
freak show.

1:10:36.541 --> 1:10:38.625
Like that word will ever
bring me down.

1:10:40.375 --> 1:10:43.250
'Cause I'm fabulous, Dean.

1:10:43.333 --> 1:10:45.333
And you might be fit,

1:10:45.416 --> 1:10:48.375
and you might be handsome,

1:10:48.458 --> 1:10:50.958
but you're so ugly.

1:10:53.791 --> 1:10:55.958
I'll see you at prom, Dean.

1:10:56.041 --> 1:10:57.791
I'm picking out a dress
just for you.

1:10:57.875 --> 1:10:59.875
(grunting)

1:10:59.958 --> 1:11:01.250
HEDGE:
Break it up!

1:11:01.333 --> 1:11:03.458
Break... break it up!

1:11:03.541 --> 1:11:05.333
-Stop it! That's it!
-The pair of you!

1:11:05.416 --> 1:11:07.000
Get him away from me.

1:11:07.083 --> 1:11:08.916
-Where are you going?
-Home.

1:11:09.000 --> 1:11:10.416
You've got your exam, Dean.

1:11:10.500 --> 1:11:12.083
Screw my exams, screw you,

1:11:12.166 --> 1:11:13.750
and screw that
disgusting thing there.

1:11:13.833 --> 1:11:15.250
'Cause if you're going
in a dress,

1:11:15.333 --> 1:11:18.416
you won't find me
nowhere near that stupid prom.

1:11:18.500 --> 1:11:21.208
-(sighs)
-What's got into you, Jamie?

1:11:21.291 --> 1:11:23.541
Eh? You know you can't
behave like that.

1:11:23.625 --> 1:11:26.500
A drag queen don't know
the meaning of the word "can't."

1:11:26.583 --> 1:11:28.916
Just ask me seven ex-husbands.

1:11:29.916 --> 1:11:32.208
You, take those off.

1:11:36.125 --> 1:11:37.958
(door closes)

1:11:39.875 --> 1:11:41.416
MASOOD:
Jamie's behavior has been

1:11:41.500 --> 1:11:44.625
utterly unacceptable, Mrs. New.

1:11:44.708 --> 1:11:46.958
And I don't use
such strong words lightly.

1:11:47.041 --> 1:11:49.000
It's just a bit of makeup.

1:11:49.083 --> 1:11:51.166
Oh, Ray, please.

1:11:51.250 --> 1:11:54.500
I work shifts. I didn't see him
leave like that, but...

1:11:54.583 --> 1:11:56.416
it's hardly
the end of the world.

1:11:56.500 --> 1:11:58.458
Well, it's the end of prom
for Dean Paxton.

1:11:58.541 --> 1:12:00.458
MARGARET:
Who's Dean Paxton?

1:12:00.541 --> 1:12:02.166
Dean from the drag club, eh?

1:12:02.250 --> 1:12:04.041
The boy who had 'em all jeering.

1:12:04.125 --> 1:12:05.958
-Oh.
-He's a knob head.

1:12:06.041 --> 1:12:07.750
Well, that's not
very helpful language.

1:12:07.833 --> 1:12:09.541
Well, he is.

1:12:09.625 --> 1:12:13.125
Uh, I-I'd like to downplay
this dialogue and say to Jamie,

1:12:13.208 --> 1:12:17.541
I want to encourage you to
uncover your individual, yeah?

1:12:17.625 --> 1:12:21.541
I want you to interface
with the true you.

1:12:24.208 --> 1:12:27.250
But is it right you want
to go to prom in a dress?

1:12:28.291 --> 1:12:29.333
(whispers):
Go on.

1:12:30.375 --> 1:12:32.208
Yeah.

1:12:32.291 --> 1:12:33.458
RAY:
Is that a problem?

1:12:36.125 --> 1:12:38.166
No, no, 'cause in this school,

1:12:38.250 --> 1:12:41.416
we are, you know, promoters

1:12:41.500 --> 1:12:43.750
of, um, freedom of expression,
and, uh...

1:12:43.833 --> 1:12:46.416
Yeah, I think what Mr. Masood
is trying to say

1:12:46.500 --> 1:12:48.416
is that there is a fine line

1:12:48.500 --> 1:12:51.166
between individuality
and disruption,

1:12:51.250 --> 1:12:54.375
and that you need to think
about how your actions

1:12:54.458 --> 1:12:56.083
are going to affect
other people.

1:12:56.166 --> 1:12:58.166
Because not everyone is
as lucky as you, Jamie.

1:12:58.250 --> 1:13:01.416
For some of these kids,
prom is...

1:13:01.500 --> 1:13:03.916
I mean, it's their last chance
to have one amazing night,

1:13:04.000 --> 1:13:06.000
and I'm not gonna let you
take that from them.

1:13:06.083 --> 1:13:08.458
How is Jamie taking anything
away from anyone?

1:13:08.541 --> 1:13:10.541
Because some of the kids
have said they're not gonna

1:13:10.625 --> 1:13:12.166
go to prom
if Jamie wears a dress.

1:13:12.250 --> 1:13:14.333
She means Dean Paxton.

1:13:14.416 --> 1:13:15.875
You heard what he called me.

1:13:15.958 --> 1:13:18.375
What? What?

1:13:19.708 --> 1:13:21.625
What did Dean Paxton call him?

1:13:21.708 --> 1:13:24.333
Well, I don't want
to repeat the word.

1:13:24.416 --> 1:13:26.250
MARGARET:
Well, I do. I want to hear.

1:13:26.333 --> 1:13:29.208
I want to know what my son's
being called at school.

1:13:30.791 --> 1:13:32.708
He called him disgusting.

1:13:32.791 --> 1:13:34.291
And-and we will deal with that.

1:13:34.375 --> 1:13:36.916
But, Jamie, this is
gonna keep happening.

1:13:37.000 --> 1:13:38.916
Mimi Me is not a student
at this school.

1:13:39.000 --> 1:13:40.750
Jamie New is.

1:13:40.833 --> 1:13:44.375
And if Jamie wants to come
to prom, he comes as Jamie.

1:13:44.458 --> 1:13:46.625
In a tie and-and a shirt
and trousers,

1:13:46.708 --> 1:13:48.041
like all the other boys.

1:13:48.125 --> 1:13:51.000
I'm sorry, but your
behavior today-- that's...

1:13:51.083 --> 1:13:53.333
that's just the way
it has to be.

1:13:55.166 --> 1:13:56.666
We've heard enough.

1:13:56.750 --> 1:13:58.083
-(door opens)
-Jamie!

1:13:58.166 --> 1:13:59.958
-(sighs)
-JAMIE: Disgusting.

1:14:00.041 --> 1:14:02.000
How could he call
Mimi Me disgusting?

1:14:02.083 --> 1:14:04.291
You know, Mimi is gorgeous,
and glamorous.

1:14:04.375 --> 1:14:06.250
Look at Miss Hedge
in her knockoff Jimmy Choos.

1:14:06.333 --> 1:14:07.791
-You know she's just jealous.
-Jamie.

1:14:07.875 --> 1:14:09.000
Calm down.

1:14:09.083 --> 1:14:10.250
Me mum and dad'll hear you.

1:14:10.333 --> 1:14:12.375
I'm not supposed to have boys
in me room.

1:14:12.458 --> 1:14:13.791
Oh, I'm sorry,
please hold me back

1:14:13.875 --> 1:14:15.291
whilst I try not to ravish you.

1:14:15.375 --> 1:14:16.916
Jamie. House rules.

1:14:17.000 --> 1:14:18.250
Come on.

1:14:18.333 --> 1:14:19.500
(sighs heavily)

1:14:25.791 --> 1:14:27.583
Your room's so tidy.

1:14:27.666 --> 1:14:28.875
I don't know how you do it.

1:14:28.958 --> 1:14:32.000
I don't have as many dresses
as you do.

1:14:34.875 --> 1:14:36.666
I like your lamp.

1:14:36.750 --> 1:14:38.916
Thanks.

1:14:41.208 --> 1:14:43.875
Jamie, do you think...

1:14:43.958 --> 1:14:46.250
Miss Hedge maybe has a point?

1:14:46.333 --> 1:14:49.458
If Mimi goes to prom,
it'll only be about her.

1:14:49.541 --> 1:14:51.791
Everyone else'll
be overshadowed.

1:14:51.875 --> 1:14:53.416
No, everyone loves Mimi.

1:14:53.500 --> 1:14:56.500
They love her on a stage...

1:14:56.583 --> 1:14:58.708
but in real life...

1:14:58.791 --> 1:15:02.208
she can say things
that upset people.

1:15:03.250 --> 1:15:06.583
Why does Mimi have to be
part of the equation?

1:15:06.666 --> 1:15:08.333
I'm gonna be a doctor,

1:15:08.416 --> 1:15:10.250
but it doesn't mean
I have to go everywhere

1:15:10.333 --> 1:15:12.041
swinging my stethoscope.

1:15:12.125 --> 1:15:14.500
'Cause without Mimi, I'm...

1:15:16.750 --> 1:15:18.833
I'm just ugly.

1:15:23.208 --> 1:15:25.125
Jamie...

1:15:25.208 --> 1:15:27.375
you are stunning.

1:15:30.583 --> 1:15:33.458
You know there's a name
like Jamie in Arabic.

1:15:34.500 --> 1:15:36.291
Jamil.

1:15:39.583 --> 1:15:41.125

Oh.

My life's a mess, Hugo.

never say such terrible things.

1:29:13.916 --> 1:29:15.083
Do you hear me?

1:29:15.166 --> 1:29:16.708

1:29:16.791 --> 1:29:18.166
Who?

1:29:19.125 --> 1:29:20.375
Me dad.

1:29:20.458 --> 1:29:22.166
Oh, don't listen to him.

1:29:22.250 --> 1:29:26.458
He's a silly, ignorant man,
that's all.

1:29:26.541 --> 1:29:28.541

over you now.

1:29:28.625 --> 1:29:29.875
No.

1:29:30.916 --> 1:29:32.916
When I'm Mimi,

1:29:33.000 --> 1:29:35.458
I can do anything.

1:29:35.541 --> 1:29:38.000
But Jamie...

1:29:38.083 --> 1:29:39.291
he's pathetic.

1:29:39.375 --> 1:29:43.250
Jamie, you put grown men
to shame,

1:29:43.333 --> 1:29:45.333
do you know that?

1:29:45.416 --> 1:29:49.083
I look at you, and this world,
and how you live in it,

1:29:49.166 --> 1:29:51.958
and how everything's
changing so fast,

1:29:52.041 --> 1:29:54.333
and I think...

1:29:54.416 --> 1:29:57.166
what do I know anymore?

1:29:57.250 --> 1:29:58.958

1:30:07.916 --> 1:30:10.250
I don't know what that means.

1:30:12.291 --> 1:30:13.625
I don't know who I am.

1:30:13.708 --> 1:30:15.625

of course you don't.

1:30:15.708 --> 1:30:18.041

1:30:19.708 --> 1:30:23.583
Jamie, the final rule of drag

1:30:23.666 --> 1:30:26.125
is that there's no such thing
as rules.

1:30:26.208 --> 1:30:28.041
Do what you need to do.

1:30:28.125 --> 1:30:30.416

I could go to prom.
