Chlamydia?

14:22.491 --> 14:24.625
- Yup.
- Nasty.

14:24.660 --> 14:26.060
(BABY CRYING IN DISTANCE)

14:26.095 --> 14:27.361
You gave it to me?

14:28.217 --> 14:30.008
N-no, I got it from you.

14:30.733 --> 14:32.533
It was my first time, remember?

14:32.568 --> 14:33.667
Oops! (LAUGHS)

14:33.702 --> 14:36.037
I should probably get that
checked out, shouldn't I?

14:36.072 --> 14:38.239
Yeah, you should.

14:40.576 --> 14:43.811
Hey, I know this is weird,
but we could still...

14:43.846 --> 14:45.145
Still what?

14:45.180 --> 14:48.114
You know, hang out sometime. (LAUGHS)

14:48.150 --> 14:50.918
(LAUGHS) Oh! Wow.

14:50.953 --> 14:54.154
(CLEARS THROAT)
Look, I mean, I've literally

14:54.189 --> 14:56.622
just put a face
to your name, Kirsten, okay?

14:56.658 --> 14:57.757
Kristen.

14:59.127 --> 15:01.561
- It's Kristen, not Kirsten.
- (DOOR OPENS)

15:05.867 --> 15:07.211
- Hey, babe.
- Hey.

15:07.246 --> 15:08.306
Mmm! (CHUCKLES)

15:08.331 --> 15:10.170
Did you get mine with the liquid Stevia?

15:10.205 --> 15:11.737
Yes, silly.

15:13.708 --> 15:15.074
So...

15:16.002 --> 15:17.669
who are you?

15:19.132 --> 15:21.347
Kirsten, Justina.

15:21.382 --> 15:23.916
- It's Kristen.
- RANDY: Justina, Kirsten.

15:25.453 --> 15:26.519
Cool.

15:27.267 --> 15:28.934
He's got chlamydia.

15:30.824 --> 15:32.891
- (DOOR SLAMS)
- (CHUCKLES)

15:32.926 --> 15:34.460
Maybe.

15:34.495 --> 15:37.529
So, the question is, "How does one form

15:37.564 --> 15:40.232
a rational response to the..."

15:42.180 --> 15:43.180
(DOOR CLOSES)

15:43.204 --> 15:45.336
GREG: Oh, good. You started without me.

15:45.372 --> 15:47.906
Mr. Boatwright, we thought we'd lost you.

15:47.941 --> 15:50.041
- Yeah, I... I thought I lost me too.
- MAN: Christ.

15:50.076 --> 15:51.640
- (PEOPLE LAUGH)
- GREG: Hello, Thomas.

15:51.665 --> 15:52.971
Good to see you again.

15:53.006 --> 15:55.380
- Greg.
- Please continue.

15:55.415 --> 15:56.781
Never mind me.

15:56.817 --> 16:00.919
Right. Well, in my book,
I examined the existential crisis

16:00.954 --> 16:03.521
of living in a world
that is overrun by chaos,

16:03.556 --> 16:05.423
corruption, war, and oppression.

16:05.458 --> 16:08.092
I believe the most rational response

16:08.128 --> 16:11.462
- is "optimism."
- Optimism? Hmm.

16:12.665 --> 16:15.266
(CHUCKLES) No wonder Dante populated

16:15.301 --> 16:17.468
the first circle of Hell
with philosophers.

16:17.504 --> 16:19.446
- (SCATTERED LAUGHS)
- Anxiety is a

16:19.471 --> 16:21.839
completely appropriate response

16:21.874 --> 16:25.042
to today's reality, Thomas. And anger.

16:25.077 --> 16:27.945
What do you want? People just to
swallow the shit that they're in?

16:27.980 --> 16:31.615
By the way, when the fuck
did we criminalize outrage?

16:31.651 --> 16:33.531
THOMAS: Greg, the point I
make is not dissimilar

16:33.555 --> 16:37.154
from the one that you laid out
in your first and... only book.

16:37.189 --> 16:41.258
Bullshit. I never said anyone should
be optimistic in the face of fascism.

16:41.293 --> 16:43.226
"It is now, in this troubling moment,

16:43.262 --> 16:46.396
"that we must always choose joy

16:46.432 --> 16:48.173
"for us, for those we love,

16:48.208 --> 16:50.133
and for the entire world."

16:51.636 --> 16:53.703
These are your words, Greg.

16:53.738 --> 16:56.005
Was the world any less challenging

16:56.041 --> 16:57.774
when they were published 30 years ago?

16:57.809 --> 17:00.242
Thirty years ago, truth was still truth,

17:00.278 --> 17:01.678
a fact was a fact,

17:01.713 --> 17:04.012
but we're not that society anymore.

17:04.049 --> 17:06.515
The world got turned upside down.

17:06.550 --> 17:09.351
Just a raging waterfall of fuckery

17:17.027 --> 17:19.861
some kind of rarified, objective wisdom?

17:19.896 --> 17:21.964
- Well, it's our innate...
- GREG: Nature...

17:21.999 --> 17:26.001
doesn't care about our individual
intellectual experiences.

17:26.036 --> 17:28.368
Believe me. Nature has plans of its own,

17:28.405 --> 17:31.239
and it is gonna be just fine without us.

20:08.227 --> 20:10.193
Well, of course. This is a crime.

It's unacceptable.

But these are just kids...

20:17.669 --> 20:19.502

20:23.142 --> 20:24.941
They're so impressionable,

messages coming at them...

20:27.945 --> 20:29.178

they shouldn't be prosecuted?

20:32.717 --> 20:34.250
There must be ways to deal with this

other than throwing young kids
into the justice system.

That's all for now.

20:48.299 --> 20:52.348
Ramon, we've agreed to avoid
using diagnostic language.

20:52.770 --> 20:55.437
And one doesn't really
inherit the disease itself,

20:55.472 --> 20:57.706
more like a predisposition for it.

20:57.741 --> 20:59.574
So, I could have inherited it?

20:59.610 --> 21:02.778
Well, how much do you know
about your biological parents?

21:02.813 --> 21:03.902
Nothing.

21:10.053 --> 21:11.853
And how do you feel about that?

21:12.669 --> 21:14.495
Whatever. I mean,

21:15.192 --> 21:16.792
Colombia was totally whacked at the time,

21:16.816 --> 21:19.894
between the cartels, the
guerrillas, the government.

21:19.930 --> 21:22.563
Pretty much everybody got killed, so...

his presence to be of comfort?

21:36.245 --> 21:37.845
Yeah. Yeah.

21:37.880 --> 21:40.481
I don't really wanna...
talk about Henry, though.

21:40.516 --> 21:44.117
He's kinda like my escape
from all this, and...

21:44.153 --> 21:46.387
I just wanna keep it that way.

21:48.623 --> 21:49.890
Okay.

Has anything worth noting happened
to you since our last session?

21:59.134 --> 22:01.235
What do you mean?
Like... like a hallucination?

22:01.270 --> 22:04.604

might have seen or heard...

22:30.962 --> 22:33.196
Here's the thing, though.
Ever since my dad's party

22:33.221 --> 22:35.320
when... when I saw the fire...

22:37.005 --> 22:38.771

is going to kill me.

takes that...

and it just lets it go.

22:47.249 --> 22:50.384
Well, we can look at other
ways to modulate your anxiety.

22:50.420 --> 22:52.718
Why? This one works.

22:52.753 --> 22:55.620
I mean, I... I take a little
bit of... of Canna Bliss...

22:55.655 --> 22:57.989
- Canna Bliss?
- Yeah, Canna Bliss,

22:58.025 --> 23:00.758
and I work on my game,
and I totally chill.

23:00.794 --> 23:01.960
It gets me in the right now.

23:01.995 --> 23:06.131
I... I just don't need anything
else, honestly, Fred.

23:07.401 --> 23:10.568
If it's okay with you, I'd like
to take a look at your game.

23:10.603 --> 23:11.969
Why? You wanna analyze it?

23:12.004 --> 23:14.572
(CHUCKLES) No. I wanna
learn more about you

23:14.607 --> 23:16.741

23:16.776 --> 23:17.842
Sure.

23:17.877 --> 23:20.077
I'll send you a link.

23:21.648 --> 23:23.848
Why did you even go over there?

23:23.883 --> 23:25.582
'Cause I had to give him the card.

23:25.618 --> 23:27.636
- What card?
- The chlamydia card.

23:27.671 --> 23:28.959
There is a card?

23:28.984 --> 23:31.088
Yes, there's a fucking card
from Planned Parenthood,

23:31.123 --> 23:32.563
and they told me to give it to Randy.

23:32.587 --> 23:34.758
Couldn't you have
mailed it to him? Jesus.

23:34.793 --> 23:37.494
I mean, Kristen,
this guy's a stool sample.

23:37.529 --> 23:40.597
The worst part is
she was all, like, nice to me,

23:40.632 --> 23:42.576
and he was in his tighty-whities,
and he's so...

23:42.601 --> 23:44.400
Kristen, hey! Babe.

23:44.436 --> 23:48.638
Mmm. Okay, look at me, all right?

23:48.674 --> 23:53.042
Do not ever, ever,
ever see this guy again.

Understand?

cuts a hundred times.

24:18.335 --> 24:19.668
Is this about the effigy?

24:19.704 --> 24:22.671
No! No, you did a fantastic
job with the press.

24:22.707 --> 24:25.908
You knew about these cuts
before I spoke to the press...

24:25.943 --> 24:30.045
but you waited for me to throw
myself into the lion's den,

24:30.080 --> 24:34.282
save you, and then... and then
turn around and fire me?

24:34.318 --> 24:36.084
Very classy, Ray.

24:36.120 --> 24:38.920
For Christ's... I was gonna tell you
this morning when I got the news,

24:38.955 --> 24:42.790
but I didn't, because...
you know, hate crime!

24:45.162 --> 24:48.096
Look, Audrey, we're all
just trying our best here.

24:48.132 --> 24:49.564
Yeah, well, it's not good enough,

24:49.599 --> 24:50.599
and you got it wrong.
