- Prince Theo killed Molly.

00:04.463 --> 00:06.528
You're the only one
who can stop the prince

00:06.548 --> 00:07.655

00:07.675 --> 00:09.281

00:10.803 --> 00:12.701

00:12.721 --> 00:14.161

London behind us.

My step-dad set up
a trust fund for me.

00:39.206 --> 00:42.314
- You could spend it with me.
- Let's do it.

00:42.334 --> 00:44.650
On the way back to court,
when the verdict's in.

00:44.670 --> 00:45.943
We can disappear.

00:45.963 --> 00:47.506

01:13.657 --> 01:16.682
Are you okay?

01:16.702 --> 01:17.725

01:17.745 --> 01:19.935
Come on, Mol.

01:19.955 --> 01:21.122
It's me.

01:23.124 --> 01:24.231
What's the matter?

01:24.251 --> 01:27.254
I'm tired of thinking about it.

01:30.716 --> 01:33.365
So come out with me tonight.

01:33.385 --> 01:36.326
Luc and I are going to Diablo
to see Roz's set.

01:36.346 --> 01:38.328
It'll be fun.

01:38.348 --> 01:41.331
I've seen Roz DJ a million times.

01:41.351 --> 01:43.854
Thanks for the support.

01:45.397 --> 01:47.128
I'm just going to stay home tonight.

01:47.148 --> 01:49.798
Get some takeaway, watch the telly.

01:49.818 --> 01:52.760
Don't be lame.

01:52.780 --> 01:55.741
Come on, Molly.

01:57.534 --> 02:00.746

02:05.793 --> 02:08.211

02:13.842 --> 02:15.741
STAN:
The verdict is in.

02:15.761 --> 02:17.409
Judge Chenery's bringing the jury back

02:17.429 --> 02:19.160
- in two hours.
- That's too soon.

02:19.180 --> 02:21.872
You need to call Pike
and see what's taking so long

02:21.892 --> 02:23.832
- with the lab results.
- I just called him.

02:23.852 --> 02:25.375
He's breathing down their necks,

02:25.395 --> 02:27.168
- I promise.
- Well, he needs to breathe harder.

02:27.188 --> 02:29.504
Grace's only shot is if we can tie

02:29.524 --> 02:32.424
Jessica Marshall's murder
to Molly's... to Prince Theo.

02:32.444 --> 02:34.718
If these two murders are linked,
the truth will come out.

02:34.738 --> 02:36.804
What? The truth will set
Grace free?

02:36.824 --> 02:38.263
Not soon enough.

02:38.283 --> 02:40.265
If the jury delivers a guilty verdict,

02:40.285 --> 02:42.183
then it won't matter if Prince Theo

02:42.203 --> 02:43.811

02:43.831 --> 02:45.771
in 140 characters or less.

PIKE:
Open the door, Luc! Luc!

11:13.756 --> 11:17.594
It's the police! Open up! Luc!

11:19.304 --> 11:20.805
BRUNO:
We really need to talk, Luc.

11:25.726 --> 11:28.709
What do you want me to say?

11:28.729 --> 11:31.045
I'm gonna record our conversation.

11:31.065 --> 11:32.713
Make sure it's done by the book.

11:32.733 --> 11:34.549
(beep)

11:34.569 --> 11:36.112
Is that okay with you, Luc?

11:38.156 --> 11:41.201
Do you remember Jessica Marshall, Luc?

11:43.161 --> 11:45.560
Yeah?

11:45.580 --> 11:47.103
Well, we found her.

11:47.123 --> 11:49.063
Found your DNA

11:49.083 --> 11:51.525
all over her dead body.

11:51.545 --> 11:53.754
You killed her, didn't you, Luc?

11:57.758 --> 11:59.636
It was an accident.

12:02.556 --> 12:04.558
She liked it rough.

12:05.475 --> 12:10.084
Liked it when I...

12:10.104 --> 12:12.587
choked her.

12:12.607 --> 12:14.733
Was she your client?
Did you work at the Courtenay?

12:17.362 --> 12:19.594
She...

12:19.614 --> 12:22.325
she always wanted more.

12:23.284 --> 12:26.100
More. And...

12:26.120 --> 12:28.582
and then...

12:30.083 --> 12:31.772
...she was just gone.

12:31.792 --> 12:34.775
Was that how it was with Molly?
Did she like it rough, too?

12:34.795 --> 12:36.236
No.

12:36.256 --> 12:38.154
No, it wasn't like that.

12:38.174 --> 12:40.156
Then how was it?

12:40.176 --> 12:42.617
I understand, Luc.

12:42.637 --> 12:45.579
You can't live
with what you've done, can you?

12:45.599 --> 12:48.039
But let me tell you something,
it doesn't matter

12:48.059 --> 12:50.458
how much junk
that you put into your veins,

12:50.478 --> 12:53.794
you will never, ever feel any better

12:53.814 --> 12:55.547
until you tell the truth.

12:55.567 --> 12:57.798
So just tell me,

12:57.818 --> 13:00.385
did you kill Molly Ryan?

13:00.405 --> 13:02.490
(crying)

13:05.201 --> 13:08.809
Yes.

13:08.829 --> 13:11.249
I killed her.

13:15.169 --> 13:17.402
I killed Molly.

13:17.422 --> 13:19.613
Why?

13:19.633 --> 13:22.616
Why did you do it?

13:22.636 --> 13:24.618
I didn't want to kill her.

13:24.638 --> 13:28.037
But I had to or...

13:28.057 --> 13:30.809
or she was going to tell about Jessica.

13:33.146 --> 13:35.836
I had to kill Molly
or she was going to tell.

13:35.856 --> 13:37.838
Okay, now, listen to me,

13:37.858 --> 13:40.592
you have to tell us
exactly how it happened, because

13:40.612 --> 13:42.843
otherwise Grace is gonna go to prison

13:42.863 --> 13:44.429
for a really long time.

13:44.449 --> 13:46.431
And that's not something
you want, is it, Luc?

13:46.451 --> 13:48.745
No. (sniffles)

13:51.623 --> 13:54.751
Grace and I were on the roof.

13:56.835 --> 13:58.859
I gave her something.

13:58.879 --> 13:59.818
A drug?

13:59.838 --> 14:01.862
Like a tranquilizer?

14:01.882 --> 14:04.218
She wasn't supposed to wake up.

14:07.180 --> 14:09.516
I went downstairs...

14:10.891 --> 14:12.185
...grabbed a knife.

14:13.436 --> 14:14.562
(gasp, grunts)

14:16.063 --> 14:17.504
I wanted it to be quick.

14:17.524 --> 14:19.339
I didn't want Molly to suffer.

14:19.359 --> 14:20.381
(choking)

14:20.401 --> 14:21.861
So I cut her throat.

14:23.904 --> 14:26.407
But she wouldn't die.

14:27.534 --> 14:29.703
(grunting)

14:33.540 --> 14:34.688
She was so strong.

14:34.708 --> 14:36.731
She just wouldn't die.

14:36.751 --> 14:38.878
(grunting)
(shouting)

14:47.345 --> 14:49.806
Tell Grace I'm sorry.

14:54.769 --> 14:55.834
No, Luc, no!

14:55.854 --> 14:58.044
- (grunting)
- No, no, no, no.

14:58.064 --> 15:00.588
This is D.I. Pike. I need
immediate medical assistance

15:00.608 --> 15:03.257
- at my location.
- We're losing him!

15:03.277 --> 15:05.176
Come on, mate.
Why didn't we find any blood

15:05.196 --> 15:07.470
on your clothes?
Where did you put your clothes?

15:07.490 --> 15:08.763
Luc! Luc!

15:08.783 --> 15:10.931
I-I fed them...

15:10.951 --> 15:12.433
(gasping)

15:12.453 --> 15:13.601
...to the dragon.

15:13.621 --> 15:15.353
You fed them to the dragon?

15:15.373 --> 15:17.938
The dragon. What's the dragon?
What does that mean?

15:17.958 --> 15:19.566
Come on. Come on. Come on.

15:19.586 --> 15:22.296
Luc! Luc!
(shouts) No!

15:26.092 --> 15:27.824
There was nothing we could do
to save him, Natalie. He's dead.

15:27.844 --> 15:29.325
Luc is dead, all right?

15:29.345 --> 15:31.786
Oh, my God, I...
I can't believe it.

15:31.806 --> 15:33.037
We got his confession on tape.

15:33.057 --> 15:34.664
I don't think that'll be enough.

15:34.684 --> 15:36.457
After what Luc pulled in court,
Judge Chenery

15:36.477 --> 15:38.459
will probably believe he lied
on his deathbed to save her.

15:38.479 --> 15:41.170
We need something
to corroborate his story,

15:41.190 --> 15:42.922
a piece of physical evidence.

15:42.942 --> 15:45.174
I know, I know.
We're working on it.

15:45.194 --> 15:47.761
Well, work fast. They're
about to deliver a verdict.

15:47.781 --> 15:50.179
Where is your client,
Mr. Gutterie?

15:50.199 --> 15:52.766
I can't bring in the jury
until the defendant is present.

15:52.786 --> 15:54.684
Well, I don't know, Your Honor.

15:54.704 --> 15:57.186
Perhaps my learned friend would
rather not hear this verdict.

15:57.206 --> 16:00.690
If this is another of your
delaying tactics, Mr. Gutterie,

16:00.710 --> 16:03.109
I won't just fine you
for contempt--

16:03.129 --> 16:05.820
I'll see that you never practice
law in this country again.

16:05.840 --> 16:08.030
Well, I would have
gladly chauffeured Grace myself

16:08.050 --> 16:11.534
to ensure her timely arrival,
but your prison system

16:11.554 --> 16:14.245
seems to think
it's better suited to the task.

16:14.265 --> 16:15.747
Apparently they were, uh,

16:15.767 --> 16:18.249
a little overconfident in their abilities.

16:18.269 --> 16:22.670
Officer, get in contact
with prison transport

16:22.690 --> 16:25.047
and find out why in
God's good name they're delaying

16:25.067 --> 16:27.091
my proceedings.

16:27.111 --> 16:29.176
DISPATCH:
Unit Five, this is dispatch

16:29.196 --> 16:30.929
requesting immediate contact.

16:30.949 --> 16:33.013
Unit Five, come in, please, Unit Five.

16:33.033 --> 16:36.643
I expected them
to get jumpy by now. It's fine.

16:36.663 --> 16:39.520
(beeping)
We're nearly at the drop car.

16:39.540 --> 16:41.250
Then we're on the home straight.

16:47.298 --> 16:50.490
- Stop the van. Stop the van!
- What?

16:50.510 --> 16:52.575
- What's the matter? You gonna be sick?
- No. This is a mistake.

16:52.595 --> 16:54.034
We have to go back.

16:54.054 --> 16:56.162
(chuckles)
Are you crazy?

16:56.182 --> 16:57.705
It's too late.

16:57.725 --> 17:00.124
If we go back, we both go to jail.

17:00.144 --> 17:02.335
I can't do this.
I can't leave my sister.

17:02.355 --> 17:04.252
- Forever.
- Grace,

17:04.272 --> 17:06.901
I've done things,
things that can't be undone.

17:07.944 --> 17:09.800
I've given up everything.

17:09.820 --> 17:11.761
I'm sorry, Josh, I really am.

17:11.781 --> 17:13.637
Oh, wow.

17:13.657 --> 17:15.473
Please.

17:15.492 --> 17:17.517
You're really something, aren't you?

17:17.537 --> 17:20.185
The papers--

17:20.205 --> 17:22.563
they don't know the half of it.

17:22.583 --> 17:24.231
I'll figure out a way
to make it up to you,

17:24.251 --> 17:26.275
to keep you out of trouble, I promise.

17:26.295 --> 17:29.111
Oh, you are way past making it up to me.

17:29.131 --> 17:31.489
Way past that.

17:31.509 --> 17:33.761
We're finishing what you started.

17:37.640 --> 17:39.851
(grunts)
(tires screeching)

17:43.855 --> 17:45.586
(hissing)

17:45.606 --> 17:47.505
(coughing)

17:47.525 --> 17:48.923
What the hell did you do?

17:48.943 --> 17:52.092
- (moans)
- We're screwed.

17:52.112 --> 17:53.803
(sirens wailing in distance)

17:53.823 --> 17:55.095
Do you hear that?

17:55.115 --> 17:56.890
They're coming for us.

17:56.910 --> 18:00.810
This doesn't have to go bad for
you if you do exactly as I say.

18:00.830 --> 18:03.604
Are you mental?
It's already gone bad!

18:03.624 --> 18:07.107
Listen to me, Josh.

18:07.127 --> 18:09.109
You're gonna put me back in
my restraints, and you're gonna

18:09.129 --> 18:12.530
- convince them this was all an accident.
- No. No.

18:12.550 --> 18:15.575
- No, they'll never believe us.
- You'll make them believe.

18:15.595 --> 18:17.326
Or you can start running.

18:17.346 --> 18:20.246
(sirens approaching)

18:20.266 --> 18:23.895
But it doesn't sound like you've
got much of a head start now.

18:29.609 --> 18:31.507
There must be something
in Molly Ryan's flat,

18:31.527 --> 18:33.927
- something we missed.
- Don't get your hopes up, mate.

18:33.947 --> 18:36.596
Crime scene techs scoured
every inch of this place.

18:36.616 --> 18:40.327
If Luc left his bloody clothes
anywhere, we'd have found them.

18:42.288 --> 18:45.165
Maybe he didn't leave them
in the building.

18:46.793 --> 18:49.442
Been all over the roof, too.
You know that.

18:49.462 --> 18:52.528
Neville told us he jumped
from his roof to Molly's

18:52.548 --> 18:54.781
when he came over there
to steal her things.

18:54.801 --> 18:57.157
Maybe Luc made the jump, too.

18:57.177 --> 18:58.846
(sighs)

19:05.394 --> 19:08.252
There's nothin' but
pigeon droppings up here, mate.

19:08.272 --> 19:10.232
I found something.

19:12.276 --> 19:14.258
Oh, damn it. It's just rubbish.

19:14.278 --> 19:17.637
This might not even be
the right roof, you know?

19:17.657 --> 19:20.180
Luc could've hidden his clothes
on any one of these rooftops.

19:20.200 --> 19:22.182
Crime scene techs will be here any minute,

19:22.202 --> 19:25.311
but, even still, they won't be
able to search them all in time.

19:25.331 --> 19:27.416
What do you reckon, try the next one over?

19:29.752 --> 19:32.777
Luc said he fed his clothes
to the dragon, right?

19:32.797 --> 19:35.800
I think we should go to the dragon.

20:05.538 --> 20:08.187
(panting)

20:08.207 --> 20:09.605
KALEY:
Mmm, that's it, baby.

20:09.625 --> 20:13.442
You like that, don't you?

20:13.462 --> 20:16.236
You're such a naughty boy.

20:16.256 --> 20:18.238
(moans)

20:18.258 --> 20:20.658
(pants)

20:20.678 --> 20:24.244
Ooh, you're such a bad boy.

20:24.264 --> 20:27.226
(pants)
Does that feel good?

20:29.269 --> 20:31.251
Yeah.

20:31.271 --> 20:33.273
Yes, it does.

20:34.901 --> 20:36.423
(Kaley gasps)
Charlotte.

20:36.443 --> 20:37.842
Oh, excuse me.

20:37.862 --> 20:39.238
I didn't mean to interrupt.

21:01.177 --> 21:02.261
(coughs)

21:03.262 --> 21:04.577
(groans)

21:04.597 --> 21:05.703
(gunshots and glass shattering)

21:05.723 --> 21:07.391
(woman screams)

21:17.317 --> 21:19.383
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
It's okay.

21:19.403 --> 21:22.302
- It's okay. I got it.
- (groaning)

21:22.322 --> 21:24.263
It's fine.
It's okay. Relax.

21:24.283 --> 21:25.806
Just breathe, okay?

21:25.826 --> 21:27.433
It's okay.
Look at me.

21:27.453 --> 21:28.976
Do something.

21:28.996 --> 21:30.061
Please!

21:30.081 --> 21:32.312
Call an ambulance or something.

21:32.332 --> 21:33.397
It's fine.

21:33.417 --> 21:34.857
PRINCE THEO:
Charlotte...

21:34.877 --> 21:36.170
Charlotte.

21:38.338 --> 21:40.424
Look, he's gonna die.
You need to call someone now.

21:41.425 --> 21:43.365
I don't think so.

21:43.385 --> 21:45.367
Um... oh, my...

21:45.387 --> 21:47.745
(groaning)

21:47.765 --> 21:49.122
PRINCE THEO (choking):
Charlotte.

21:49.142 --> 21:50.456
KALEY:
Here.

21:50.476 --> 21:52.875
It's gonna be fine.
Everything's gonna be fine.

21:52.895 --> 21:56.336
The Grace Atwood case is full
of drama to the very end.

21:56.356 --> 21:59.339
The infamous defendant was late
to her own verdict

21:59.359 --> 22:02.342
because a paparazzo chased
her prison transport van,

22:02.362 --> 22:05.345
causing them to spin out of
control and wreck.

22:05.365 --> 22:08.348
It would appear we finally
have a defendant.

22:08.368 --> 22:10.350
And perhaps we may proceed

22:10.370 --> 22:12.228
to the main reason we are
gathered here today,

22:12.248 --> 22:13.854
the verdict.

22:13.874 --> 22:16.398
Your Honor, my client hit her head

22:16.418 --> 22:19.359
quite forcefully in that crash.

22:19.379 --> 22:21.361
I think the most prudent course
of action would be to seek

22:21.381 --> 22:22.905
immediate medical attention.

22:22.925 --> 22:25.241
Your client has already received

22:25.261 --> 22:27.160
medical attention at the site.

22:27.180 --> 22:28.452
There'll be no more delays.

22:28.472 --> 22:29.954
- Your Honor, with all due respect...
- Bailiff.

22:29.974 --> 22:31.809
Bring in the jury.

22:37.439 --> 22:38.356
(door opening)

22:40.400 --> 22:42.008
We're ready for you.

22:42.028 --> 22:43.383
(door closing)

22:43.403 --> 22:45.886
(courtroom exclaiming)

22:45.906 --> 22:47.429
- Your Honor.
- Your Honor, please forgive

22:47.449 --> 22:48.931
the unorthodox interruption.

22:48.951 --> 22:51.058
We would like to present
some new evidence.

22:51.078 --> 22:53.351
New evidence that would
exonerate Grace Atwood

22:53.371 --> 22:54.770
in the murder of Molly Ryan.

22:54.790 --> 22:56.396
GWENDOLYN:
This is outrageous.

22:56.416 --> 22:58.858
Your Honor, the Defense
has rested its case.

22:58.878 --> 23:00.901
The jury is literally
waiting in the wings.

23:00.921 --> 23:02.195
The defense counsel is just

23:02.215 --> 23:03.737
pulling another one of his stunts.

23:03.757 --> 23:06.740
This is not a stunt.

23:06.760 --> 23:08.929
Gwen, I promise, you're going
to want to hear what we found.

23:14.727 --> 23:17.877
Please, step back.

23:17.897 --> 23:19.461
(door closing) JUDGE CHENERY:
If new and probative evidence

23:19.481 --> 23:23.299
is uncovered before the jury
delivers its verdict,

23:23.319 --> 23:27.136
then the Defense is entitled
to present that evidence.

23:27.156 --> 23:30.223
- Your Honor, I...
- But...

23:30.243 --> 23:32.850
Before I allow the jury to hear anything,

23:32.870 --> 23:34.310
I want someone to tell me what the hell

23:34.330 --> 23:35.413
is going on around here.

23:37.333 --> 23:39.439
(recorder beeps)

23:39.459 --> 23:44.320
LUC (recorded, crying):
Yes, I killed her.

23:44.340 --> 23:45.905
I killed Molly.

23:45.925 --> 23:49.449
I had to kill Molly
or she was going to tell.

23:49.469 --> 23:51.911
I grabbed a knife.

23:51.931 --> 23:54.955
I wanted it to be quick.

23:54.975 --> 23:57.708
I didn't want Molly to suffer,

23:57.728 --> 24:00.711
so I cut her throat.

24:00.731 --> 24:03.839
She just wouldn't die.

24:03.859 --> 24:06.342
(crying)

24:06.362 --> 24:10.888
Tell Grace I'm sorry.

24:10.908 --> 24:12.014
(recorder beeps)

24:12.034 --> 24:14.392
Luc Pascal died

24:14.412 --> 24:17.144
from a self-inflicted
knife wound moments later.

24:17.164 --> 24:19.397
We found
his blood-stained clothes

24:19.417 --> 24:21.274
hidden behind a sign on a rooftop

24:21.294 --> 24:24.235
very nearby the building
where Molly was killed.

24:24.255 --> 24:27.988
And the blood...
has it been tested?

24:28.008 --> 24:29.489
Not fully, but our preliminary blood type

24:29.509 --> 24:30.741
and test done at the scene

24:30.761 --> 24:32.159
revealed it matched Molly Ryan's

24:32.179 --> 24:35.288
extremely rare, AB negative, blood type.

24:35.308 --> 24:38.249
JUDGE CHENERY: Given Mr. Bruno's
checkered history,

24:38.269 --> 24:41.001
I have severe reservations
about allowing the jury

24:41.021 --> 24:42.836
to hear this evidence.

24:42.856 --> 24:44.422
The confession could have been coerced.

24:44.442 --> 24:45.923
The bloody clothes manufactured.

24:45.943 --> 24:48.801
Detective Inspector Pike
has a flawless record,

24:48.821 --> 24:50.428
Your Honor.

24:50.448 --> 24:52.221
As D.S. Bruno's former partner,

24:52.241 --> 24:54.807
I find his word less than sacrosanct.

24:54.827 --> 24:56.516
(groans)
But it is for the jury

24:56.536 --> 24:58.518
to determine the credibility of witnesses.

24:58.538 --> 25:00.104
Therefore, I'll allow it.

25:00.124 --> 25:04.524
But there'll be a recess
to grant the crown time

25:04.544 --> 25:06.110
to prepare its rebuttal.

25:06.130 --> 25:08.757
How much time will you need,
Madam Prosecutor?

25:09.967 --> 25:11.135
Ms. Hall?

25:15.431 --> 25:17.391
I don't need any more time.

25:20.394 --> 25:22.418
I don't think the jury need to

25:22.438 --> 25:24.711
determine the credibility
of these witnesses.

25:24.731 --> 25:28.841
I'm satisfied that
they're telling the truth.

25:28.861 --> 25:32.552
I'm satisfied that Grace Atwood is...

25:32.572 --> 25:34.347
not guilty

25:34.367 --> 25:36.349
in the murder of Molly Ryan,

25:36.369 --> 25:38.058
and on behalf of the Crown,

25:38.078 --> 25:40.686
I move to dismiss the charge against her.

25:40.706 --> 25:43.541
Are you sure you don't require
time to reflect?

25:44.793 --> 25:46.733
I'm quite sure.

25:46.753 --> 25:48.339
Then I grant your motion.

25:49.965 --> 25:53.760
The murder charge against
Grace Atwood is dismissed.

25:56.096 --> 25:57.848
(gavel bangs)

26:07.607 --> 26:09.735
It's over.

26:13.239 --> 26:17.014
It's over.

26:17.034 --> 26:20.226
(reporters clamoring)

26:20.246 --> 26:22.395
Grace Atwood is relieved

26:22.415 --> 26:24.230
to be out from under the cloud

26:24.250 --> 26:26.399
of suspicion that has followed

26:26.419 --> 26:28.775
her since the tragic morning
she discovered

26:28.795 --> 26:30.610
her dear friend Molly Ryan murdered.

26:30.630 --> 26:32.488
Now, I am just thankful

26:32.508 --> 26:36.033
that today I was finally able
to prove her innocence

26:36.053 --> 26:38.035
beyond a reasonable doubt.

26:38.055 --> 26:39.870
- Now, what do we have?
- Are you really counting this

26:39.890 --> 26:41.788
as a personal victory,
Mr. Gutterie?

26:41.808 --> 26:45.084
We don't know what the jury's
verdict would have been.

26:45.104 --> 26:46.626
Seems like more of a victory

26:46.646 --> 26:49.942
for the detectives of Scotland Yard.

26:51.277 --> 26:52.799
Any day that justice is served,

26:52.819 --> 26:54.885
I count as a personal victory.

26:54.905 --> 26:56.011
All right, what do we got?

26:56.031 --> 26:57.533
(reporters clamoring)

27:02.746 --> 27:04.144
Hey, Detective. Wait up.

27:04.164 --> 27:06.480
I-I just wanted to thank you.

27:06.500 --> 27:07.647
No need to thank me.

27:07.667 --> 27:10.650
I was just doing my job.

27:10.670 --> 27:12.736
Doing my old job.

27:12.756 --> 27:15.822
I think it was a little more than that.

27:15.842 --> 27:17.783
You taking Grace home now?

27:17.803 --> 27:19.721
I already booked our flight.

27:21.140 --> 27:22.640
We leave tonight.

27:24.184 --> 27:26.083
- I wish we could, like...
- Too bad we couldn't...

27:26.103 --> 27:28.668
You first.

27:28.688 --> 27:30.045
Okay.

27:30.065 --> 27:31.275
I, uh...

27:33.693 --> 27:37.136
I just...

27:37.156 --> 27:40.534
I just hope that you have
a happy life, Natalie.

27:42.411 --> 27:44.662
You, too, Alex.

27:51.462 --> 27:54.236
TELEVISION REPORTER: Prince Theo
is still in critical condition

27:54.256 --> 27:56.572
following a hunting accident.

27:56.592 --> 27:58.115
It is reported that...

27:58.135 --> 27:59.825
Bold move, cousin.

27:59.845 --> 28:02.161
Not sure I'd have the stones
to be out, if I were you.

28:02.181 --> 28:03.954
What do you mean?

28:03.974 --> 28:06.123
Buckingham Palace may be
covering for their randy prince,

28:06.143 --> 28:08.292
but not doubt they'll already
be searching for you.

28:08.312 --> 28:10.002
What are you playing at, Declan?
I know you're the one

28:10.022 --> 28:11.003
who shot the prince.

28:11.023 --> 28:13.589
Why would I shoot the prince

28:13.609 --> 28:14.840
when you said you were going to?

28:14.860 --> 28:16.383
You're lying, you shot him.

28:16.403 --> 28:18.718
But it turns out the bastard's innocent.

28:18.738 --> 28:20.095
He may not have killed your sister,

28:20.115 --> 28:21.930
but I'd hardly call Prince Theo innocent.

28:21.950 --> 28:23.390
None of them are.

28:23.410 --> 28:25.579
The blood of our people is on their hands.

28:27.540 --> 28:29.146
You used me.

28:29.166 --> 28:30.397
To get to him.

28:30.417 --> 28:31.627
Believe what you want.

28:33.420 --> 28:36.153
It doesn't matter who shot him.

28:36.173 --> 28:38.738
You're the one who's been
spouting your mouth off

28:38.758 --> 28:41.241
about how you were gonna get
vengeance for your wee sister.

28:41.261 --> 28:43.369
And you're the one

28:43.389 --> 28:45.683
who's been sleeping
with the prince's whore.

28:50.062 --> 28:51.771
They're coming for you Patrick.

29:04.868 --> 29:07.787
(sobbing)

29:15.754 --> 29:16.796
Hey.

29:19.799 --> 29:21.781
Gwen, I know I'm probably
the last person you want to see.

29:21.801 --> 29:23.576
I want to hate you.

29:23.596 --> 29:25.744
I want to hate you, I really do.

29:25.764 --> 29:27.787
But I can't.

29:27.807 --> 29:29.789
(scoffs)

29:29.809 --> 29:32.792
'Cause if it wasn't for you,

29:32.812 --> 29:34.503
I might've sent an innocent girl to prison

29:34.523 --> 29:36.589
for the rest of her life.

29:36.609 --> 29:38.507
We don't know that.

29:38.527 --> 29:39.841
We don't know what the...

29:39.861 --> 29:41.594
what the jury verdict was gonna be,

29:41.614 --> 29:42.802
they might've seen it right.

29:42.822 --> 29:44.888
(scoffs)

29:44.908 --> 29:47.807
So what, I'm a blind fool,
but at least I'm bad in court?

29:47.827 --> 29:49.643
Is that supposed to comfort me?
(sniffs)

29:49.663 --> 29:51.039
No, that's not what I meant.

30:00.674 --> 30:02.948
Ever since what happened in Ashington,

30:02.968 --> 30:05.909
I knew what I wanted to do with my life.

30:05.929 --> 30:09.455
I wanted to make sure
that people who do bad things

30:09.475 --> 30:11.810
get punished.

30:13.604 --> 30:14.938
This case.

30:16.898 --> 30:19.256
This case.

30:19.276 --> 30:23.843
This case, it just...

30:23.863 --> 30:25.679
I let it get under my skin.

30:25.699 --> 30:27.889
And I forgot!

30:27.909 --> 30:29.683
It's my job to protect the innocent

30:29.703 --> 30:31.602
just as much as punish the guilty.

30:31.622 --> 30:34.438
But we can't do this job if it
doesn't get under our skin,

30:34.458 --> 30:35.689
can we?

30:35.709 --> 30:36.940
And this case,

30:36.960 --> 30:39.610
it twisted all of us up, not just you.

30:39.630 --> 30:41.320
At least your mistakes got fixed.

30:41.340 --> 30:42.613
Come on.

30:42.633 --> 30:43.863
You just sold one of the biggest cases

30:43.883 --> 30:45.491
Scotland Yard's had in years.

30:45.511 --> 30:46.742
I'm gonna speak to the Commissioner,

30:46.762 --> 30:47.867
get you reinstated.

30:47.887 --> 30:49.662
I can live without my badge, Gwen.

30:49.682 --> 30:51.288
But Donovan Trimbly going free?

30:51.308 --> 30:52.976
I don't know quite how
I'm supposed to live with that.

30:57.481 --> 31:00.922
(chuckles)

31:00.942 --> 31:03.216
We've not had out best run
lately, have we?

31:03.236 --> 31:06.845
(chuckles softly)

31:06.865 --> 31:09.473
(laughs)

31:09.493 --> 31:11.891
(groans)
I need a drink.

31:11.911 --> 31:14.748
Come to think of it, don't I owe you one?

31:16.500 --> 31:19.670
Come on. What do you say?
One drink.

31:20.671 --> 31:22.902
Okay.

31:22.922 --> 31:25.467
Just one drink. (chuckles)

31:42.275 --> 31:43.757
Well, hello.

31:43.777 --> 31:46.719
You can help me celebrate.

31:46.739 --> 31:48.846
Do you like scotch?

31:48.866 --> 31:50.764
I figured it out.

31:50.784 --> 31:52.932
Figured what out?

31:52.952 --> 31:55.477
Why you've been feeding me
the biggest stories

31:55.497 --> 31:57.937
this city has seen in years.

31:57.957 --> 32:01.274
Yeah, well, that's no mystery.

32:01.294 --> 32:02.942
You're young and hungry...

32:02.962 --> 32:04.695
I'm a nobody.

32:04.715 --> 32:06.946
I knew you had an angle.

32:06.966 --> 32:10.659
The great Stan Gutterie
always has an angle.

32:10.679 --> 32:12.661
So I started looking into you.

32:12.681 --> 32:15.748
Into why you came to London when
you got disgraced in the U.S.

32:15.768 --> 32:17.310
You know what I found out?

32:18.896 --> 32:21.545
It wasn't the first time
you'd lived in the UK.

32:21.565 --> 32:23.963
You were here as a Rhodes Scholar.

32:23.983 --> 32:26.299
About 26 years ago, isn't that right?

32:26.319 --> 32:28.864
Yeah, that's right.

32:29.907 --> 32:33.306
Here's a funny coincidence.

32:33.326 --> 32:37.289
You were at Oxford at
the exact same time as my mum.

32:38.916 --> 32:40.959
When she got knocked up.

32:43.670 --> 32:46.256
You're my father.

32:47.257 --> 32:49.301
Yeah, I am.

32:57.559 --> 32:59.458
You know, um,

32:59.478 --> 33:01.293
when she told me that she was pregnant,

33:01.313 --> 33:02.961
I was already back in the States.

33:02.981 --> 33:05.589
And, uh...

33:05.609 --> 33:08.007
Well, in case you haven't noticed, I'm...

33:08.027 --> 33:10.009
kind of a selfish bastard.

33:10.029 --> 33:13.430
So when she, um, suggested

33:13.450 --> 33:15.599
that we live our separate lives,

33:15.619 --> 33:18.477
I didn't put up too much of a fight.

33:18.497 --> 33:21.229
But 20 years later,

33:21.249 --> 33:24.983
when I had to find
a new place to call home,

33:25.003 --> 33:26.318
I chose London.

33:26.338 --> 33:28.445
And I wanted to see you

33:28.465 --> 33:31.030
right from the start.

33:31.050 --> 33:34.012
But I got...

33:35.806 --> 33:37.390
I lost my nerve.

33:40.059 --> 33:42.208
Then, you what, you started
writing these stories,

33:42.228 --> 33:44.628
uh, about the case and about me.

33:44.648 --> 33:46.045
And I thought,
"Geez, what is that?"

33:46.065 --> 33:49.048
I thought,
"Is that, like, a sign?"

33:49.068 --> 33:51.510
And I know I should've...

33:51.530 --> 33:52.385
told you the truth

33:52.405 --> 33:55.221
right when I saw you.

33:55.241 --> 33:57.432
But I thought maybe...

33:57.452 --> 33:59.893
if you get to know me a bit

33:59.913 --> 34:01.227
before I break the news,

34:01.247 --> 34:03.438
you might not... (clears throat)

34:03.458 --> 34:07.066
hate me as much.

34:07.086 --> 34:09.695
You thought you could make up
for a lifetime of abandonment

34:09.715 --> 34:11.967
with a few lame scoops?

34:15.679 --> 34:17.096
Nice try.

34:19.016 --> 34:21.831
But I'm not interested.

34:21.851 --> 34:24.062
Dad.

34:32.987 --> 34:34.302
If you weren't interested,

34:34.322 --> 34:36.616
you wouldn't have come to see me!
