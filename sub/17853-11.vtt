00:00.768 --> 00:03.469
<i>Tonight on
The Curse of Oak Island...</i>

00:03.471 --> 00:05.237
Everything's going in
that dumpster.

00:05.239 --> 00:07.439
There's something that comes
from below, we'll find it.

00:09.777 --> 00:12.177
I think there's
something in the airlift.

00:12.179 --> 00:14.046
Look at that. That's a bone!

00:14.048 --> 00:16.515
<i>Dan believes that there is
a body down there.</i>

00:16.517 --> 00:18.751
<i>Back on the hunt, in 10-X.</i>

00:18.753 --> 00:20.519
We know that FDR was interested

00:20.521 --> 00:22.554
in the treasure hunt
here on Oak Island.

00:22.556 --> 00:25.090
I was able to find the
president's personal file.

00:25.092 --> 00:26.725
Guess what I found in
that folder?

00:26.727 --> 00:28.360
Whoa... that's remarkable.

00:31.665 --> 00:35.100
<i>There is an island
in the North Atlantic,</i>

00:35.102 --> 00:38.437
<i>where people have been looking
for an incredible treasure</i>

00:38.439 --> 00:41.473
<i>for more than 200 years.</i>

00:41.475 --> 00:45.210
<i>So far, they have found bits
of gold chain...</i>

00:45.212 --> 00:49.314
<i>a stone slab with strange
symbols carved into it...</i>

00:49.316 --> 00:52.751
<i>even a 17th Century
Spanish coin.</i>

00:52.753 --> 00:58.057
<i>To date, six men have died
trying to solve the mystery.</i>

00:58.059 --> 01:00.626
<i>And, according to legend,</i>

01:00.628 --> 01:03.562
<i>one more will have to die,</i>

01:03.564 --> 01:06.265
<i>before the treasure
can be found.</i>

01:18.312 --> 01:19.845
How much water you got?

01:19.847 --> 01:22.514
You're at two foot, nine inches.

01:22.516 --> 01:23.415
Okay.

01:23.417 --> 01:25.617
Down just a bit more.

01:25.619 --> 01:27.453
<i>It is the beginning of another</i>

01:27.455 --> 01:29.655
<i>momentous day on Oak Island...</i>

01:29.657 --> 01:31.223
I think that's good.

01:31.225 --> 01:33.358
<i>As Rick Lagina,</i>

01:33.360 --> 01:35.694
<i>along with other members
of the Oak Island team,</i>

01:35.696 --> 01:39.098
<i>begin pumping thousands of
cubic feet of air into</i>

01:39.100 --> 01:43.135
<i>borehole 10-X in an effort to
flush what they hope will be</i>

01:43.137 --> 01:45.671
<i>important artifacts up to
the surface.</i>

01:45.673 --> 01:47.639
Everything's going in
that dumpster.

01:47.641 --> 01:50.242
There's something that comes
from below, we'll find it.

01:50.244 --> 01:52.244
Well, that's for sure.

01:52.246 --> 01:54.346
<i>The airlift works by inserting</i>

01:54.348 --> 01:59.151
<i>a pipe some 230 feet to
the bottom of 10-X.</i>

01:59.153 --> 02:02.521
<i>Then a large volume of
compressed air is pumped</i>

02:02.523 --> 02:04.523
<i>down to force water,</i>

02:04.525 --> 02:07.226
<i>sediment, and any objects
back up through</i>

02:07.228 --> 02:08.727
<i>the pipe to the surface.</i>

02:08.729 --> 02:10.795
The sediment,

02:10.798 --> 02:15.601
<i>otherwise known as "spoils", is
then deposited into a container</i>

02:15.603 --> 02:19.471
<i>and searched for potentially
important artifacts.</i>

02:19.473 --> 02:22.441
Airlifting 10-X is
the right thing to do.

02:22.443 --> 02:25.210
<i>I think the massive size of this</i>

02:25.212 --> 02:26.845
<i>equipment and the air
we're gonna put to it,</i>

02:26.847 --> 02:28.413
<i>we're gonna bring up
anything that's in that</i>

02:28.415 --> 02:29.915
<i>chamber that's worth seeing.</i>

02:29.917 --> 02:31.550
I really believe that.

02:31.552 --> 02:34.353
Let's crack some more air.

02:34.355 --> 02:37.189
Try giving it just
a little bit more.

02:39.493 --> 02:42.694
That's good!
You're sucking dirt now.

02:42.696 --> 02:44.863
How'd you like to have some
of this equipment

02:44.865 --> 02:46.732
when you and I was working?

02:46.734 --> 02:48.500
I wouldn't know what to do
with it all.

02:50.304 --> 02:53.372
<i>First drilled by
Oak Island treasure-hunter,</i>

02:53.374 --> 02:57.342
<i>Dan Blankenship in
the early 1970s,</i>

02:57.344 --> 03:00.345
<i>10-X was intended
to be something of a</i>

03:00.347 --> 03:04.583
<i>"back door" into the so-called
Money Pit.</i>

03:04.585 --> 03:07.286
<i>Although Dan hit a
booby-trapped flood tunnel</i>

03:07.288 --> 03:10.355
<i>at a depth of 60 feet,</i>

03:10.357 --> 03:13.659
<i>he kept drilling and digging,</i>

03:13.661 --> 03:18.330
<i>ultimately making 10-X the
deepest borehole on the island,</i>

03:18.332 --> 03:22.634
<i>at a staggering depth of
235 feet.</i>

03:25.272 --> 03:27.272
How's the water in the hole?

03:27.274 --> 03:30.375
The water line is good.

03:30.377 --> 03:34.313
You know Dan, I've been
mesmerized by 10-X since I

03:34.315 --> 03:35.814
first saw those photographs.

03:35.816 --> 03:40.252
I wonder if in half an hour
we'll actually hold in our

03:40.254 --> 03:43.589
hands what you saw long ago;
That's our hope.

03:43.591 --> 03:45.791
Well... mine, too.

03:45.793 --> 03:47.726
Mine too. Yup.

03:47.728 --> 03:52.497
<i>When Dan put a camera down 10-X,</i>

03:52.499 --> 03:56.902
<i>he discovered what he maintains
is evidence of human activity,</i>

03:56.904 --> 04:02.007
<i>including wooden posts,
a large chest,</i>

04:02.009 --> 04:03.742
<i>antique tools</i>

04:03.744 --> 04:08.413
<i>and possibly human remains.</i>

04:08.415 --> 04:12.317
I... I'm on record saying
there's a corpse down there.

04:12.319 --> 04:15.554
- Right.
- Just watch out for bones.

04:16.991 --> 04:19.257
Well, hopefully today we'll
get some answers.

04:21.295 --> 04:23.962
<i>Unfortunately, in the 1980s,</i>

04:23.964 --> 04:27.466
<i>Dan ran out of money
to explore 10-X,</i>

04:27.468 --> 04:31.837
<i>until partnering with
the Laginas ten years ago.</i>

04:31.839 --> 04:35.707
<i>And it has taken him until
now to try and prove that</i>

04:35.709 --> 04:39.044
<i>what he first discovered was
not merely the product of his</i>

04:39.046 --> 04:41.647
<i>wishful imagination.</i>

04:41.649 --> 04:43.515
What's all this about?

04:43.517 --> 04:45.350
This came out of 10-X.

04:45.352 --> 04:46.752
That came out of 10-X.

04:46.754 --> 04:49.688
That came out of 10-X,
and that came out of 10-X.

04:49.690 --> 04:51.456
What more do you want, Marty?

04:51.458 --> 04:54.793
Chain, wire, and that
low carbon steel.

04:54.795 --> 04:58.764
It all tested out as
being made prior to 1750.

04:58.766 --> 05:00.732
All of that came from
the bottom of the damn hole!

05:00.734 --> 05:02.301
All of those things?

05:02.302 --> 05:03.982
All of it came from
the bottom of the hole.

05:05.873 --> 05:08.607
I have a long history with 10-X.
I've always said,

05:08.609 --> 05:10.609
<i>in order to put,
at my brother calls,</i>

05:10.611 --> 05:15.614
<i>an "X" through 10-X,
we need to find something.</i>

05:15.616 --> 05:17.983
<i>Last year, Rick, Marty</i>

05:17.985 --> 05:20.886
<i>and the team arranged
for professional diver,</i>

05:20.888 --> 05:23.588
<i>John Chatterton,
to successfully reach</i>

05:23.590 --> 05:25.557
<i>the bottom of borehole 10-X.</i>

05:28.962 --> 05:31.863
<i>Due to dense layers of clay
and sediment,</i>

05:31.865 --> 05:35.767
<i>visibility in the underground
cavern was virtually zero.</i>

05:37.705 --> 05:38.705
What is that, John?

05:42.710 --> 05:46.078
<i>Even more disappointing
was the report John Chatterton</i>

05:46.080 --> 05:49.481
<i>issued after making
the harrowing dive.</i>

05:49.483 --> 05:52.851
I had a rock that
I would estimate was

05:52.853 --> 05:56.488
10 inches to 12 inches.

05:56.490 --> 05:59.925
I picked it up, I moved it,
it was... it was heavy.

05:59.927 --> 06:04.563
To me, that was what gave you
the sonar signal of the box.

06:08.068 --> 06:09.968
<i>Because the data retrieved</i>

06:09.970 --> 06:12.971
<i>from the dive conflicted
with other data,</i>

06:12.973 --> 06:16.842
<i>Rick, Marty and the team are
hoping that today's efforts</i>

06:16.844 --> 06:19.778
<i>to airlift 10-X will
give them a reason</i>

06:19.780 --> 06:23.815
<i>to continue investing both time
and money at this site.</i>

06:26.420 --> 06:28.487
Right now, everything seems to
be working well.

06:28.489 --> 06:32.090
This scares the out
of me, if you know what I mean.

06:32.092 --> 06:34.659
You're afraid the cavity
might collapse, or...?

06:34.661 --> 06:36.094
I'm afraid of...

06:36.096 --> 06:41.032
I'm afraid that area between 212
and 214 may collapse.

06:41.034 --> 06:44.136
You remember, I told you,
there's a fissure around 212?

06:44.138 --> 06:47.339
Right.

06:47.340 --> 06:50.541
<i>During one of his dives
into 10-X in the 1970s...</i>

06:50.544 --> 06:53.945
<i>Dan Blankenship noticed
a large and potentially</i>

06:53.947 --> 06:57.449
<i>dangerous fissure in
the anhydrite bedrock,</i>

06:57.451 --> 07:02.521
<i>starting at a depth of
approximately 212 feet.</i>

07:02.523 --> 07:04.423
<i>If the enormous pressure caused</i>

07:04.425 --> 07:07.826
<i>by the airlift process
triggers a collapse,</i>

07:07.828 --> 07:10.529
<i>the result would
be catastrophic,</i>

07:10.531 --> 07:14.599
<i>as far as any further ability
to explore 10-X is concerned.</i>

07:18.672 --> 07:19.871
Watch the hose, there!

07:21.842 --> 07:23.141
Just see if you can
help Michel out

07:23.143 --> 07:25.210
with that other pump, there.

07:25.212 --> 07:27.446
<i>Suddenly,</i>

07:27.448 --> 07:28.947
<i>something appears to have caused</i>

07:28.949 --> 07:31.583
<i>the airlift to stop working.</i>

07:31.585 --> 07:33.185
Shut her down.

07:39.860 --> 07:41.760
Okay, you turn yours off.

07:43.997 --> 07:46.198
I think there's something
in the airlift...

07:46.200 --> 07:48.900
it's thumping.

07:48.902 --> 07:51.069
Let's lift it up, check
if we got a clog.

07:51.071 --> 07:52.504
Let's try that.

07:54.608 --> 07:56.875
You only gotta come up 10 or 15
feet.

07:59.513 --> 08:01.079
I don't know why they pulled up.

08:01.081 --> 08:05.183
Probably what I had feared,
that that damn roof caved in.

08:05.185 --> 08:09.187
If you feel the hose,
it's pounding.

08:09.189 --> 08:11.957
It's like there's something
caught in it.

08:11.959 --> 08:14.693
- We got a plug in there.
- Yeah.

08:14.695 --> 08:17.028
<i>Is it possible that
a large object</i>

08:17.030 --> 08:18.897
<i>has clogged the airlift?</i>

08:18.899 --> 08:21.733
<i>If so, what could it be?</i>

08:21.735 --> 08:23.835
<i>A large rock?</i>

08:23.837 --> 08:28.139
<i>Or perhaps one of the objects
Dan Blankenship claims he saw</i>

08:28.141 --> 08:30.742
<i>some 40 years ago?</i>

08:30.744 --> 08:33.778
So, where are we,
what's your plan here?

08:33.780 --> 08:36.047
So, right now our water
flow wasn't there,

08:36.049 --> 08:38.183
so we think we had a plug
up inside.

08:38.184 --> 08:39.852
We're going to try it again.

08:39.852 --> 08:41.520
I think the plug is cleared
out of the airlift.

08:41.522 --> 08:43.621
So, we'll give it another
kick and see what happens.

08:43.624 --> 08:44.689
All right.

08:48.695 --> 08:49.961
Leave it open.

08:51.131 --> 08:54.132
That's perfect.

09:02.743 --> 09:04.910
All right, we're seeing
some activity here.

09:08.215 --> 09:09.848
Hear the dirt?

09:11.685 --> 09:13.919
There it is.

09:13.921 --> 09:16.655
Working well, now.

09:16.657 --> 09:18.823
<i>With the adjustment having been</i>

09:18.825 --> 09:21.760
<i>made by the team from
Irving Equipment Ltd.,</i>

09:21.762 --> 09:24.863
<i>the airlift process resumes.</i>

09:24.865 --> 09:28.166
We just want to get our
water flowing properly here,

09:28.168 --> 09:30.135
and once we get that going,

09:30.137 --> 09:32.103
we want to lift for maybe
another 20, 30 minutes,

09:32.105 --> 09:34.306
and then we'll
drain that out and see

09:34.308 --> 09:35.640
what's in there for sediment.

09:35.642 --> 09:39.311
It's going to be interesting.

09:39.313 --> 09:40.546
- It's hard to say.
- Hope we find something.

09:40.547 --> 09:41.780
I hope so, too.

09:41.782 --> 09:44.583
<i>As we move forward with</i>

09:44.585 --> 09:47.352
<i>the airlift in 10-X,
it's exciting.</i>

09:47.354 --> 09:51.022
We've worked out the kinks in
the system and now the airlift

09:51.024 --> 09:53.358
should be able to proceed
uninterrupted.

09:53.360 --> 09:55.327
<i>The whole idea, of course,</i>

09:55.329 --> 09:57.963
<i>is to get the material
off the floor in 10-X.</i>

09:57.965 --> 10:00.699
<i>And I think, at this point,
we'll be successful.</i>

10:00.701 --> 10:03.234
Let's shut down and we'll
drain that out.

10:03.236 --> 10:04.336
Close it.

10:06.373 --> 10:09.975
<i>Whatever materials are on
the bottom of 10-X should</i>

10:09.977 --> 10:11.843
<i>now be in that dumpster.</i>

10:11.845 --> 10:14.279
<i>After draining
the water from the inside</i>

10:14.281 --> 10:16.247
<i>of the metal container,</i>

10:16.249 --> 10:19.618
<i>the Oak Island team can
now begin their inspection</i>

10:19.620 --> 10:23.054
<i>of the 10-X spoils.</i>

10:23.056 --> 10:24.823
I don't know what to
say about it;

10:24.825 --> 10:27.058
- I was expecting a lot more.
- Yeah.

10:27.060 --> 10:30.829
<i>Rick, Charles and
Jack will first</i>

10:30.831 --> 10:32.797
<i>empty the contents
of the container</i>

10:32.799 --> 10:36.901
<i>into the 21.5-ton
front-end loader.</i>

10:36.903 --> 10:41.373
<i>From there, the spoils can be
deposited at a neutral location</i>

10:41.375 --> 10:44.409
<i>to be meticulously
searched for artifacts,</i>

10:44.411 --> 10:47.679
<i>or potentially valuable clues.</i>

10:47.681 --> 10:50.882
Jack! Right here.

10:50.884 --> 10:52.384
Jack, that looks interesting.

10:52.386 --> 10:53.752
I'll bag it.

10:57.724 --> 11:01.793
This... I think this is...
I don't know what that is.

11:01.795 --> 11:03.895
It's not steel.

11:03.897 --> 11:05.764
Jack, you got another bag?

11:05.766 --> 11:08.199
<i>Several pieces came up
out of the hole.</i>

11:08.201 --> 11:11.269
<i>Incredibly blackened,
I don't think it's wood,</i>

11:11.271 --> 11:13.238
I have no idea what it is.

11:15.909 --> 11:18.009
Rick! Come here!

11:19.946 --> 11:21.346
Look at that.

11:21.348 --> 11:22.380
That's a bone.

11:28.822 --> 11:32.357
<i>A bone?
Found in the mud and sediment</i>

11:32.359 --> 11:36.027
<i>that Rick and the team just
pumped out of borehole 10-X?</i>

11:36.029 --> 11:38.029
Can kind of still feel
the marrow in there...

11:38.031 --> 11:41.032
Jack, come here!
You got a baggie, Jack?

11:41.034 --> 11:42.934
We got a bone here.
You gotta come see it.

11:42.936 --> 11:44.881
- All right.
- You got a baggie?

11:44.882 --> 11:46.827
<i>Could Charles Barkhouse have</i>

11:46.828 --> 11:48.773
<i>just found evidence
of human remains?</i>

11:48.775 --> 11:51.776
Whoa!

11:51.777 --> 11:54.778
<i>Perhaps validating what
Dan Blankenship claims he saw</i>

11:54.781 --> 11:57.348
<i>four decades ago?</i>

11:57.350 --> 12:00.285
It's black.

12:00.287 --> 12:03.421
<i>Charles found a bone.
At that point,</i>

12:03.423 --> 12:06.057
is it human or animal?

12:06.059 --> 12:08.159
Human or animal?
If it's a human bone,

12:08.161 --> 12:10.095
wow, what does this mean?

12:10.097 --> 12:12.731
That needs to go to a forensic
pathologist.

12:12.733 --> 12:14.332
Exactly.

12:14.334 --> 12:17.068
We're gonna, pretty much have
to sift through here.

12:17.070 --> 12:18.470
- Absolutely.
- Yeah.

12:18.472 --> 12:20.205
It's gotta go through a
fine-tooth comb, no question.

12:20.207 --> 12:22.807
And get every bone
we find tested.

12:22.809 --> 12:24.275
Everything. Every wood fragment.

12:24.277 --> 12:25.877
If any of
them turn up to be human,

12:25.879 --> 12:28.079
- that will be big.
- That would be big.

12:28.081 --> 12:30.281
It will prove that there was
a body down there.

12:30.283 --> 12:32.984
You're right.
We bag and tag everything.

12:32.986 --> 12:35.153
But, let's get this cleared
out for now.

12:35.155 --> 12:37.075
- Well, that's our plan, then.
- That's our plan.

12:41.061 --> 12:44.295
<i>Jack's gonna be in charge.
He'll build a screen,</i>

12:44.297 --> 12:46.331
put the sediment on a little
bit at a time,

12:46.333 --> 12:50.135
wash the material
and then visually inspect it.

12:50.137 --> 12:53.304
<i>It's gonna be very tedious,
but Jack's up to the task</i>

12:53.306 --> 12:55.073
<i>and he's excited about doing it.</i>

13:08.088 --> 13:10.355
<i>After spending
the last several days</i>

13:10.357 --> 13:13.024
<i>collecting and sifting
through the spoils</i>

13:13.026 --> 13:14.826
<i>from the bottom of 10-X...</i>

13:14.828 --> 13:16.795
- Ready?
- Is the hose powered on, still?

13:16.797 --> 13:18.263
Yep.

13:18.265 --> 13:22.066
Jack Begley along with
his stepfather, Craig Tester,

13:22.068 --> 13:25.870
are nearly finished searching
them for valuable artifacts.

13:25.872 --> 13:29.073
Alright, this is the
last load of 10-X.

13:29.075 --> 13:31.342
- Hopefully there's a...
- A coin?

13:31.344 --> 13:34.012
A coin in here, yeah.

13:34.014 --> 13:37.348
<i>We have this diamond mesh
trough that we pour</i>

13:37.350 --> 13:39.184
<i>the spoils out onto,</i>

13:39.186 --> 13:41.252
<i>and then spray 'em
down with a hose</i>

13:41.254 --> 13:43.021
<i>to get the clay off quicker,</i>

13:43.023 --> 13:46.858
and hopefully reveal as much
man-made stuff as we can.

13:49.196 --> 13:52.897
I'll get this out of the way.
I do about half,

13:52.899 --> 13:54.399
and I just kind of let... yeah.

13:54.401 --> 13:56.901
Beat it on the side
a little bit.

13:59.272 --> 14:00.839
That's probably good.

14:00.841 --> 14:04.175
There's a chunk of wood.

14:04.177 --> 14:06.978
Did you find anything this big
before?

14:06.980 --> 14:09.113
No. Here, let me clean that off.

14:13.620 --> 14:17.488
Now, is this the dimension
that was in Dan's films?

14:17.490 --> 14:19.023
It's so hard to tell,

14:19.025 --> 14:20.925
because there's no good,
you know,

14:20.927 --> 14:23.394
focus on, or how
far away it was.

14:23.396 --> 14:26.364
You can definitely see it's
cut here...

14:26.366 --> 14:28.933
But it doesn't look like
a circular saw.

14:28.935 --> 14:31.002
No, by no means. No, this is...

14:31.004 --> 14:32.303
Older, then.

14:32.305 --> 14:34.005
- Hopefully.
- Yeah.

14:34.007 --> 14:36.474
This wood looks like some of
the wood that I saw

14:36.476 --> 14:38.943
on Dan Blankenship's film

14:38.945 --> 14:41.279
back when he
originally went down in 10-X.

14:41.281 --> 14:43.147
It looks really old,

14:43.149 --> 14:46.417
and you can see
the handsaw marks on it.

14:46.419 --> 14:48.253
I think it's some great
information.

14:52.359 --> 14:56.327
Look at this. Black wood
with that-that tar stuff.

14:56.329 --> 14:58.396
- That tar stuff?
- Yeah...

14:58.398 --> 15:00.331
I mean, does this look
like pitch to you?

15:00.333 --> 15:02.233
Could be.

15:02.235 --> 15:04.502
I know they used to use
pitch blend as a sealant on

15:04.504 --> 15:07.338
ships and other places.

15:07.340 --> 15:09.941
Original people here,
because they came in ships,

15:09.943 --> 15:12.543
they would have had access
to it.

15:12.545 --> 15:15.947
<i>The use of pitch,
also known as resin,</i>

15:15.949 --> 15:19.350
<i>dates as far back
as the third millennium BC,</i>

15:19.352 --> 15:21.786
<i>to ancient Egypt,</i>

15:21.787 --> 15:24.221
<i>where it served as caulking
between the wooden deck planks</i>

15:24.224 --> 15:26.357
<i>of sailing vessels.</i>

15:26.359 --> 15:29.527
<i>It was later used as a sealant
for waterproofing</i>

15:29.529 --> 15:31.095
<i>wooden chests.</i>

15:33.366 --> 15:35.099
- That same material.
- Yeah.

15:35.101 --> 15:38.202
- Maybe the same material.
- I think it's the same.

15:38.204 --> 15:39.671
<i>Based upon what</i>

15:39.673 --> 15:43.107
Craig and I found in the 10-X
spoils, it's encouraging.

15:43.109 --> 15:45.543
Not only is it stuck onto rocks
and other things,

15:45.545 --> 15:47.512
- but onto that wood.
- Onto that wood, which is...

15:47.514 --> 15:48.513
Because we could
date that, yeah.

15:48.515 --> 15:49.480
Yep.

15:49.482 --> 15:51.382
<i>There's several items</i>

15:51.384 --> 15:53.718
<i>that seem that they could
be from original people,</i>

15:53.720 --> 15:56.721
<i>and we're gonna have to show
this stuff to Dan Blankenship</i>

15:56.723 --> 15:59.490
<i>and to the rest of the group,
'cause there's a lot of stuff</i>

15:59.492 --> 16:03.461
in here that could prove whether
or not 10-X is worthwhile.

16:03.463 --> 16:06.464
- We got a bunch of bags full.
- Yep, definitely.

16:06.466 --> 16:07.598
Think this'll do it.

16:07.600 --> 16:09.667
Okay, well let's take a few

16:09.669 --> 16:11.602
of the more interesting things
and show 'em to the guys.

16:11.604 --> 16:13.471
Sounds good.

16:18.712 --> 16:21.179
<i>The agenda is what we've
done at 10-X...</i>

16:21.181 --> 16:24.182
and, everyone knows
that we tried to airlift.

16:24.184 --> 16:26.684
<i>After nearly a week
of sifting through</i>

16:26.686 --> 16:29.554
<i>the hundreds of pounds
of sediment</i>

16:29.555 --> 16:32.423
<i>that the airlift brought up
from the bottom of borehole</i>

16:32.425 --> 16:35.727
<i>the Oak Island team has
gathered in the War Room to</i>

16:35.729 --> 16:38.463
<i>assess their most
interesting finds.</i>

16:38.465 --> 16:41.265
I mean, as the process
was going on,

16:41.267 --> 16:43.501
we could hear the material
rattling through that pipe,

16:43.503 --> 16:45.036
and we shoveled it out.

16:45.038 --> 16:46.637
Jack, I don't know, you've
gone through it.

16:46.639 --> 16:48.539
You and Craig have gone
through it.

16:48.541 --> 16:49.474
What'd you come up with?

16:49.476 --> 16:52.110
Um...

16:52.112 --> 16:54.112
pieces of wood.

16:54.114 --> 16:57.115
Would these have been anything
that you dropped into the hole?

16:57.117 --> 17:00.718
Hell, no, because this is
deteriorated so much.

17:00.720 --> 17:02.553
That's older than I am.

17:02.555 --> 17:05.423
'Cause, I had wondered if
this is possibly original.

17:09.561 --> 17:12.763
That's old!
There's no question about that.

17:12.766 --> 17:14.699
But in the same token,

17:14.701 --> 17:18.502
that's the first man-made wood
that I've seen come out of 10-X.

17:18.505 --> 17:20.304
And you can see the cuts, too!

17:20.306 --> 17:23.508
There's no question that
was cut with a handsaw.

17:23.510 --> 17:26.577
But you know that you
didn't put or use any

17:26.579 --> 17:28.079
wood like that around 10-X?

17:28.080 --> 17:29.447
I know I didn't!

17:29.449 --> 17:34.519
I wouldn't have a saw
that would make that cut.

17:34.521 --> 17:37.488
Well, that's not... that's not
all we found, though.

17:37.490 --> 17:42.226
We also found wood with some
sort of black substance.

17:42.228 --> 17:45.763
I found it on a couple different
items that were brought up.

17:45.765 --> 17:48.699
Could the original people
have used this for

17:48.701 --> 17:51.302
some purpose in 10-X?
I don't know.

17:51.304 --> 17:54.305
Did you use anything like that
when you were working in 10-X?

17:54.307 --> 17:55.840
Hell, no.

17:55.842 --> 17:59.177
No, I know that's
not from mine...

17:59.179 --> 18:01.813
- No. Jack, we drilled.
- Why are we throwing in?

18:04.117 --> 18:05.583
Dan was sitting right there
and he said,

18:05.585 --> 18:07.518
"we didn't put these in there."

18:07.520 --> 18:09.587
<i>He couldn't think of anything
he would have put in.</i>

18:09.589 --> 18:11.422
<i>I took him to mean
the entire hole.</i>

18:11.424 --> 18:13.224
Let me see that.

18:13.226 --> 18:14.125
<i>In other words, nothing like
that could have</i>

18:14.127 --> 18:15.660
<i>fallen in there, even.</i>

18:15.662 --> 18:17.462
- Okay, let's get it dated.
- Absolutely.

18:17.464 --> 18:19.297
We have to do that.

18:19.299 --> 18:20.531
Yeah, for sure.

18:20.533 --> 18:22.266
Without a question,

18:22.268 --> 18:26.370
this is not something that
was dropped in the hole by...

18:26.372 --> 18:29.173
- Us.
- Well, then that's great news.

18:29.175 --> 18:32.210
<i>I am very satisfied with
what we did in 10-X.</i>

18:32.212 --> 18:35.246
We've got a bunch of
things to run tests on,

18:35.248 --> 18:38.850
and if they come back,
you know, as an "a-ha!" moment,

18:38.852 --> 18:41.786
<i>then yeah, then 10-X is right
back on the list.</i>

18:41.788 --> 18:43.287
Okay, so there's not quite

18:43.289 --> 18:44.355
an "X" in 10-X,
that's what we're saying here.

18:44.357 --> 18:45.656
Right.

18:45.658 --> 18:47.859
- You agree to that?
- I'll agree to that.

18:47.861 --> 18:49.694
- Not quite.
- Okay.

18:49.696 --> 18:50.828
All right.

18:54.667 --> 18:57.735
<i>One day after
the team's decision to maintain</i>

18:57.737 --> 19:01.172
<i>their search operation
at borehole 10-X,</i>

19:01.174 --> 19:05.209
<i>Rick, Marty and the team
are about to begin another</i>

19:05.211 --> 19:08.246
<i>major operation at Smith's Cove.</i>

19:08.248 --> 19:12.383
<i>They are hoping to discover one
or more of the box drains,</i>

19:12.385 --> 19:15.319
<i>which are believed to fill
the booby-trapped flood tunnels</i>

19:15.321 --> 19:17.889
<i>in the Money Pit
with ocean water.</i>

19:17.891 --> 19:20.525
<i>If successful,
they might be able</i>

19:20.527 --> 19:23.394
<i>to turn off the water
before they begin digging</i>

19:23.396 --> 19:27.265
<i>their third major
exploration shaft in the area.</i>

19:27.267 --> 19:28.900
Okay guys, here's the guy who's
going to be

19:28.902 --> 19:30.801
in charge of the layout of
the bladder,

19:30.803 --> 19:32.236
- Jeremy.
- Morning!

19:32.238 --> 19:34.839
- He's our boss this morning.
- Okay.

19:34.841 --> 19:37.275
All right, what's gonna happen
here is we're going to go out

19:37.277 --> 19:39.377
and survey the water
just to make sure

19:39.379 --> 19:41.646
there's no shar-sharp
objects or stuff.

19:41.648 --> 19:43.248
Anything that's going
to interfere...

19:43.249 --> 19:44.849
I thought you were going
to say sharks.

19:44.850 --> 19:46.450
I did, too.

19:46.452 --> 19:49.353
But, then we're going to roll
out our first dam,

19:49.355 --> 19:52.690
and we'll fill it up, so we're
gonna get fairly wet.

19:52.692 --> 19:55.660
So not only is this a practical
application of your product,

19:55.662 --> 19:57.595
but... history in the making.

19:57.597 --> 20:00.531
- Sounds great.
- Okay. Let's do this!

20:00.533 --> 20:03.634
<i>It was at Smith's Cove in 1850,</i>

20:03.636 --> 20:06.604
<i>that treasure-hunters
from the Truro Company</i>

20:06.606 --> 20:08.806
<i>reportedly uncovered five</i>

20:08.808 --> 20:11.642
<i>intricately constructed
stone box drains,</i>

20:11.644 --> 20:15.580
<i>which seemed to converge
into a single tunnel.</i>

20:15.582 --> 20:17.481
<i>The drains were covered
by layers</i>

20:17.483 --> 20:20.284
<i>of coconut fiber and eelgrass,</i>

20:20.286 --> 20:24.622
<i>which acted as a filter
to keep out sand and debris.</i>

20:24.624 --> 20:26.591
<i>It was this system</i>

20:26.593 --> 20:28.893
<i>that was believed to be
feeding ocean water</i>

20:28.895 --> 20:31.495
<i>into the booby-trapped
flood tunnels that had</i>

20:31.497 --> 20:35.499
<i>thwarted efforts to dig
in the Oak Island Money Pit.</i>

20:35.501 --> 20:38.569
<i>The temporary cofferdam
will be composed</i>

20:38.571 --> 20:42.373
<i>of four 100-foot inflatable
bladder sections,</i>

20:42.375 --> 20:46.677
<i>which will be connected to form
an arc around Smith's Cove.</i>

20:46.679 --> 20:50.014
<i>Once the cofferdam is
installed, Rick, Marty,</i>

20:50.016 --> 20:52.583
<i>Craig and the team will be able</i>

20:52.585 --> 20:55.519
<i>to pump water out of
the enclosed area,</i>

20:55.521 --> 20:58.489
<i>in order to do a safe and
thorough search for any</i>

20:58.491 --> 21:00.491
<i>portions of the original
box drains</i>

21:00.493 --> 21:03.427
<i>that may still be intact.</i>

21:03.429 --> 21:06.964
So, the middle of that would
correspond pretty much

21:06.966 --> 21:09.367
to where we want the main
excavation.

21:09.369 --> 21:12.336
Around this here. Okay.

21:12.338 --> 21:15.406
<i>Dan Henskee located
the area of interest,</i>

21:15.408 --> 21:19.010
and Dan believes, and I believe
in Dan, that there

21:19.012 --> 21:21.946
is a small undisturbed
section of the box drains,

21:21.948 --> 21:23.981
or the booby-trap system,

21:23.983 --> 21:26.384
or the drain system,
however you want to define it.

21:26.386 --> 21:28.052
I think it still exists.

21:28.054 --> 21:31.522
So, we'll start with the
50-footer right here,

21:31.524 --> 21:32.957
work our way down to the bank,

21:32.959 --> 21:35.993
and we'll get to Marty
and the excavator situated just

21:35.995 --> 21:38.996
over here so that he can
swing them out as we need them.

21:38.998 --> 21:41.532
So, I'll pick up this first one
and go plunk it in the water.

21:41.534 --> 21:42.867
- Yes.
- Okay.

21:45.038 --> 21:47.705
<i>I think the Smith's
Cove work is every bit</i>

21:47.707 --> 21:49.740
<i>as exciting
as the Money Pit work.</i>

21:49.742 --> 21:51.942
<i>And, the Smith's Cove work,</i>

21:51.944 --> 21:55.513
deals with the original story.

21:55.515 --> 21:57.415
Where do you want it?

21:57.416 --> 21:59.316
Right there, we'll float it
around.

21:59.319 --> 22:00.518
We just gotta turn it around.

22:14.534 --> 22:16.467
Whoa!

22:16.469 --> 22:17.935
That could've hurt!

22:19.839 --> 22:22.406
<i>Are there really box
drains in Smith's Cove?</i>

22:22.408 --> 22:25.810
We know there's coconut fiber.
Dated very early.

22:25.812 --> 22:28.779
<i>But there are no photographs
of the box drains.</i>

22:28.781 --> 22:31.449
<i>So, if we find a box drain,</i>

22:31.451 --> 22:33.851
<i>it's surely historically
significant.</i>

22:33.853 --> 22:37.355
<i>And for that to happen, for us,
at this time frame,</i>

22:37.357 --> 22:38.823
it's very important.

22:38.825 --> 22:41.559
Watch yourselves.

22:41.561 --> 22:43.994
We're already half-way done.
Or almost.

22:43.996 --> 22:46.530
Okay, that's good for now, guys.

22:46.532 --> 22:48.933
Let's get one person on the
other side of this tube here.

22:48.935 --> 22:51.602
Just gonna fold it back.

22:51.604 --> 22:54.572
Look, it's unrolling itself.

22:54.574 --> 22:57.708
<i>I'm very anxious,
and very hopeful about the work</i>

22:57.710 --> 22:59.510
we're about
to conduct in Smith's Cove.

22:59.512 --> 23:01.011
<i>Answers, I think,</i>

23:01.013 --> 23:03.614
<i>are waiting for us
behind that cofferdam.</i>

23:05.585 --> 23:08.486
<i>If that drain system is still
there, it proves,</i>

23:08.488 --> 23:11.455
<i>or goes a long way to prove,
that Oak Island is real,</i>

23:11.457 --> 23:13.424
<i>to the most hardened skeptic.</i>

23:13.426 --> 23:15.626
The pumps are working
and water's coming in.

23:15.628 --> 23:19.130
We've already got a little bit
of growth in the dam down here.

23:19.132 --> 23:20.765
This one won't take that long

23:20.767 --> 23:22.933
to fill, because it's all on
the slope, right?

23:22.935 --> 23:25.870
<i>Using a pump, each section</i>

23:25.872 --> 23:27.905
<i>of the bladder will be inflated</i>

23:27.907 --> 23:31.675
<i>with 120,000 gallons
of seawater,</i>

23:31.677 --> 23:34.645
<i>ultimately forming an
8-foot high barrier.</i>

23:40.453 --> 23:41.685
It's probably almost full
by now.

23:41.687 --> 23:43.120
Yeah.

23:43.122 --> 23:46.757
I guess we'll know once
and for all if the flood tunnels

23:46.759 --> 23:48.993
or box drains are really here.

23:48.995 --> 23:51.562
Yeah. That could be before
the end of this week.

23:51.564 --> 23:54.131
- Yeah, could be.
- We're due for a success.

23:57.437 --> 23:59.637
No! It burst!

23:59.639 --> 24:01.872
- We got a big leak.
- Whoa!

24:05.044 --> 24:08.379
You're losing water!

24:08.380 --> 24:11.715
It's pouring out over there!

24:11.717 --> 24:13.117
We got a rupture!

24:14.720 --> 24:16.720
That is not good.

24:20.760 --> 24:25.696
Why would that happen?

24:25.698 --> 24:28.249
<i>At Smith's Cove,</i>

24:28.250 --> 24:30.801
<i>the water-filled cofferdam
that Rick, Marty and the team</i>

24:30.803 --> 24:35.005
<i>are installing has inexplicably
split wide open.</i>

24:35.007 --> 24:37.041
What happened, do you know?

24:39.212 --> 24:40.244
She ruptured.

24:40.246 --> 24:43.113
It's a gaping hole like that!

24:43.115 --> 24:45.716
<i>The sudden failure
of the cofferdam,</i>

24:45.718 --> 24:47.751
<i>which is made of highly durable,</i>

24:47.753 --> 24:50.054
<i>layered polypropylene plastic,</i>

24:50.056 --> 24:54.191
<i>deals a devastating blow to
contractor, Jeremy Frizzell.</i>

24:54.193 --> 24:57.928
<i>In fact, after witnessing
more than 100</i>

24:57.930 --> 25:00.097
<i>successful prior installations,</i>

25:00.099 --> 25:03.534
<i>he has never seen
anything like it before.</i>

25:03.536 --> 25:06.737
- You think it was... damaged?
- It's stretched.

25:06.739 --> 25:07.938
Yeah, you can feel that.

25:07.940 --> 25:11.509
- It's stretched.
- Yeah, you can feel...

25:11.511 --> 25:15.846
It's unusual. Must have been...

25:15.848 --> 25:18.148
I don't know what it...
It's hard to say...

25:18.150 --> 25:20.985
She blew out with
considerable force.

25:20.987 --> 25:22.086
Yeah, she did.

25:22.088 --> 25:23.821
I've never, ever, seen that
before.

25:23.823 --> 25:25.256
There have been multiple,

25:25.258 --> 25:27.791
multiple equipment
failures on this island,

25:27.793 --> 25:30.961
things that just should
not go wrong, go wrong.

25:30.963 --> 25:34.131
<i>Over the past two centuries,</i>

25:34.133 --> 25:37.601
<i>treasure hunters on Oak
Island have been plagued by</i>

25:37.603 --> 25:41.138
<i>countless equipment failures
and hundreds of bizarre,</i>

25:41.140 --> 25:44.542
<i>sometimes fatal,
freak accidents.</i>

25:44.544 --> 25:49.647
<i>Such was the case
on March 26th, 1897,</i>

25:49.649 --> 25:53.617
<i>when a pulley system at the
Money Pit suddenly broke loose,</i>

25:53.619 --> 25:56.854
<i>causing a worker named Maynard
Kaiser to fall more than</i>

25:56.856 --> 25:59.023
<i>100 feet to his death.</i>

26:01.294 --> 26:03.127
<i>Shortly afterwards,</i>

26:03.129 --> 26:06.764
<i>rumors of a deadly curse
began to circulate,</i>

26:06.766 --> 26:10.901
<i>including one which states
that seven men must die in</i>

26:10.903 --> 26:14.238
<i>active pursuit of the treasure
before the Oak Island mystery</i>

26:14.240 --> 26:17.207
<i>can be solved.</i>

26:17.209 --> 26:20.811
It could be weeks before
I get a replacement.

26:20.813 --> 26:22.179
We'll get her done.

26:22.181 --> 26:25.115
You may be not used to this,
but we're used to it.

26:25.117 --> 26:26.650
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I'm definitely

26:26.652 --> 26:28.652
not used to it, so...

26:31.791 --> 26:33.207
- We'll keep moving forward.
- Okay.

26:33.208 --> 26:34.624
<i>Although this latest
setback will cost.</i>

26:34.627 --> 26:39.063
<i>Rick, Marty and the team both
in time and money,</i>

26:39.065 --> 26:41.198
<i>they are committed
to making this year</i>

26:41.200 --> 26:43.300
<i>the most successful one yet,</i>

26:43.302 --> 26:45.903
<i>as far as their efforts to
solve the mystery</i>

26:45.905 --> 26:48.172
<i>are concerned.</i>

26:48.174 --> 26:50.708
<i>There's lots of what ifs
and who knows</i>

26:50.710 --> 26:52.009
<i>going on at this point,</i>

26:52.011 --> 26:55.145
but, we are a
community of people,

26:55.147 --> 26:58.782
committed to one
single endeavor,

26:58.784 --> 27:01.785
and that is to solve
the Oak Island mystery.

27:01.787 --> 27:04.388
We will lock arms
and get that done.

27:15.167 --> 27:16.266
So, I think everyone knows...

27:16.268 --> 27:18.702
Doug, and Paul, of course.

27:18.704 --> 27:20.971
<i>The next day,</i>

27:20.972 --> 27:23.239
<i>as the team awaits news
concerning their prospects</i>

27:23.242 --> 27:25.943
<i>of replacing the ruptured
cofferdam,</i>

27:25.945 --> 27:29.179
<i>Rick Lagina has invited
researchers Doug Crowell</i>

27:29.181 --> 27:32.216
<i>and Paul Troutman to
the War Room.</i>

27:32.218 --> 27:35.219
<i>Paul is the son
of James Troutman,</i>

27:35.221 --> 27:40.891
<i>who worked on the island
for Robert Dunfield in 1965.</i>

27:40.893 --> 27:42.993
That's strange, look at
these rocks right here,

27:42.995 --> 27:44.895
look at the heat coming
off these rocks.

27:44.897 --> 27:46.764
That is incredible.

27:46.766 --> 27:48.365
<i>Like his father,</i>

27:48.367 --> 27:53.003
<i>he is also committed to helping
solve the Oak Island mystery.</i>

27:53.005 --> 27:55.706
Paul, you've done some
interesting work,

27:55.708 --> 27:59.176
so I'll let you dive right in,
and let's see what you've got.

27:59.178 --> 28:02.046
Well thank you, Rick. I've found
some very interesting material.

28:02.048 --> 28:04.081
Through some certain
circumstances,

28:04.083 --> 28:08.185
I actually found a letter
that actually was for FDR,

28:08.187 --> 28:10.454
from, Duncan Harris
was his name.

28:10.456 --> 28:12.289
He was a personal friend
of the Roosevelt's.

28:12.291 --> 28:13.891
Yep,

28:13.893 --> 28:16.927
and he apparently was
the point man for FDR,

28:16.929 --> 28:19.863
on Oak Island, and a
secretary for him.

28:19.865 --> 28:21.999
<i>Of the hundreds of people over</i>

28:22.001 --> 28:24.034
<i>the past two centuries who have</i>

28:24.036 --> 28:26.403
<i>searched for treasure
on Oak Island,</i>

28:26.405 --> 28:29.873
<i>one of the most intriguing
is none other than.</i>

28:29.875 --> 28:33.777
<i>U.S. President,
Franklin Delano Roosevelt.</i>

28:33.779 --> 28:36.980
<i>As a young man, FDR was
a member of</i>

28:36.982 --> 28:40.417
<i>the Old Gold Salvage and
Wrecking Company that launched</i>

28:40.419 --> 28:44.421
<i>a major search operation
on the island in 1909,</i>

28:44.423 --> 28:48.292
<i>under the leadership
of Captain Henry L. Bowdoin.</i>

28:48.294 --> 28:50.461
<i>Although Roosevelt later went on</i>

28:50.463 --> 28:53.063
to become
President of the United States,

28:53.065 --> 28:54.998
<i>he never lost his interest</i>

28:55.000 --> 28:57.501
<i>in the search
for treasure on Oak Island.</i>

28:59.305 --> 29:02.406
I went through the archives
and I actually pulled his folder

29:02.408 --> 29:05.008
from the president's
personal file.

29:05.010 --> 29:07.277
And guess what I found in
that folder.

29:07.279 --> 29:10.247
Lots of Oak Island information
and letters.

29:10.249 --> 29:13.016
There's a letter from
Gilbert Hedden in there.

29:13.018 --> 29:16.954
That's a picture of Bowdoin,
and a salvage operation.

29:16.956 --> 29:19.022
Now this one will be of personal
interest to you, Charles.

29:19.024 --> 29:21.091
This actually confirms that FDR

29:21.093 --> 29:23.961
was a masonic member, actually.

29:23.963 --> 29:27.831
Yes, so was Erwin Hamilton,
so was Gilbert Hedden.

29:27.833 --> 29:29.967
The list goes on and on.

29:29.969 --> 29:31.769
This is a folder called
"Knights Templar,"

29:31.771 --> 29:33.771
and the masonic
people were actually writing

29:33.773 --> 29:36.140
to him as "his excellency."

29:36.142 --> 29:39.076
<i>There are many who
believe that the mysterious</i>

29:39.078 --> 29:42.880
<i>order of warrior monks known
as the Knights Templar</i>

29:42.882 --> 29:45.816
<i>took possession of priceless
religious objects</i>

29:45.818 --> 29:48.986
<i>during the Crusades
and hid them away,</i>

29:48.988 --> 29:51.121
<i>perhaps on Oak Island,</i>

29:51.123 --> 29:54.558
<i>sometime around the 14th
century.</i>

29:54.560 --> 29:57.861
<i>It is also believed that,
in recent years,</i>

29:57.863 --> 30:01.899
<i>the society known as
Freemasons continue to maintain</i>

30:01.901 --> 30:06.370
<i>many of the Templar traditions
and sacred responsibilities.</i>

30:06.372 --> 30:08.972
<i>Could Paul Troutman be
on the verge</i>

30:08.974 --> 30:12.843
<i>of a major discovery linking
the Oak Island treasure</i>

30:12.845 --> 30:16.814
<i>to the 32nd President
of the United States?</i>

30:16.816 --> 30:20.017
So, this whole archive is
filled with letters,

30:20.019 --> 30:21.819
photographs...

30:21.821 --> 30:23.987
You ran across a treasure trove
of documents, in its own right.

30:23.989 --> 30:25.989
I did. There is a lot
of material

30:25.991 --> 30:27.491
to look through, which I'd love
to show you.

30:27.493 --> 30:28.859
Would you be interested

30:28.861 --> 30:29.960
in joining me in going
to the archives?

30:29.962 --> 30:31.261
- No.
- I'm in.

30:31.263 --> 30:33.497
- Of course, we would!
- Okay, okay.

30:33.499 --> 30:35.432
I figured you might be.

30:35.434 --> 30:38.101
FDR's involvement is well
documented

30:38.103 --> 30:42.005
on Oak Island, his belief in it,
even in his latter years.

30:42.007 --> 30:44.908
<i>There's probably documents
in the library.</i>

30:44.910 --> 30:46.443
Is it a place that I would
like to go?

30:46.445 --> 30:48.312
I'm sure we all would like
to go.

30:48.314 --> 30:49.613
This is an information hunt

30:49.615 --> 30:51.481
every bit as much as
a treasure hunt.

30:51.483 --> 30:52.883
- You've always said that, Rick.
- I've always said that.

30:52.885 --> 30:54.551
Let's go,
and let's get this done.

30:54.553 --> 30:56.854
You'll not get a "no"
from any of us.

30:56.856 --> 30:58.121
- Let's go.
- Let's do it.

31:05.865 --> 31:07.998
NToday, it really is,

31:08.000 --> 31:10.968
like I've always said,
an information hunt.

31:10.970 --> 31:12.502
<i>While awaiting the arrival</i>

31:12.504 --> 31:15.539
<i>of the new cofferdam system
at Smith's Cove,</i>

31:15.541 --> 31:19.009
<i>Rick Lagina and his nephew
Alex have traveled nearly</i>

31:19.011 --> 31:20.978
<i>700 miles,</i>

31:20.980 --> 31:24.114
<i>on their way to join
researcher Paul Troutman at</i>

31:24.116 --> 31:28.018
<i>the FDR presidential
library in Hyde Park, New York.</i>

31:29.355 --> 31:31.188
I don't think people,

31:31.190 --> 31:35.125
possibly no one has ever
gone there before us,

31:35.127 --> 31:38.629
looking for Oak Island
research in the museum.

31:38.631 --> 31:41.331
It would be interesting to see,
you know,

31:41.333 --> 31:43.934
who FDR was communicating
with about Oak Island,

31:43.936 --> 31:45.502
and maybe other subjects
as well.

31:45.504 --> 31:47.604
That would be cool.

31:47.606 --> 31:50.507
Any more evidence is great
that you know you can count on,

31:50.509 --> 31:54.378
as you know, there's
thousands of theories.

31:54.380 --> 31:56.546
- No shortage of theories.
- No shortage of theories.

31:56.548 --> 31:58.282
So, you can start plugging
in to stuff,

31:58.284 --> 32:01.018
the info that you trust,

32:01.020 --> 32:03.053
and eliminating some of those
theories, and I guess

32:03.055 --> 32:04.221
you can make progress that way.

32:04.223 --> 32:05.489
The hope is, you know,

32:05.491 --> 32:07.124
we'll find some sort of
documents,

32:07.126 --> 32:10.160
or, and/or pictures that will
help us in the search.

32:11.697 --> 32:15.198
<i>As the 32nd President
of the United States,</i>

32:15.200 --> 32:17.267
<i>Franklin Delano Roosevelt was</i>

32:17.269 --> 32:20.971
<i>elected to an unprecedented
four terms in office,</i>

32:20.973 --> 32:27.477
<i>serving from 1933 until
his death in 1945.</i>

32:27.479 --> 32:31.315
<i>An avid collector and
historian in his own right,</i>

32:31.317 --> 32:34.217
<i>Roosevelt strongly
believed that the records</i>

32:34.219 --> 32:36.186
<i>he had amassed over his life,</i>

32:36.188 --> 32:39.556
<i>both as a private citizen
and as a public official,</i>

32:39.558 --> 32:43.593
<i>belonged to the American people.</i>

32:43.595 --> 32:48.031
<i>It was in this spirit that he
donated nearly 16 acres</i>

32:48.033 --> 32:50.500
<i>of his family's property
on the Hudson River</i>

32:50.502 --> 32:55.272
<i>so that the first presidential
library could be built there.</i>

32:55.274 --> 32:58.542
<i>The FDR library
houses approximately</i>

32:58.544 --> 33:02.079
<i>17 million documents
pertaining to everything</i>

33:02.081 --> 33:03.380
<i>from Roosevelt's personal</i>

33:03.382 --> 33:05.315
<i>correspondence with the
public...</i>

33:05.317 --> 33:07.651
<i>to private letters and
records from his work</i>

33:07.653 --> 33:10.220
<i>as a New York attorney.</i>

33:10.222 --> 33:13.657
Paul Troutman has done very
credible preliminary research

33:13.659 --> 33:16.377
and has indicated

33:16.378 --> 33:19.096
<i>that there may be some answers
at the FDR museum and,</i>

33:19.098 --> 33:22.599
<i>thus the need to go there
and help with that undertaking.</i>

33:22.601 --> 33:24.067
Let me get the door for ya.

33:24.069 --> 33:25.435
<i>I love the information hunt.</i>

33:25.437 --> 33:26.970
<i>It's-it's every bit as important</i>

33:26.971 --> 33:28.504
<i>as digging and drilling,
in my opinion.</i>

33:28.507 --> 33:30.140
- Hello!
- Hi.

33:30.142 --> 33:32.075
Welcome to the FDR Presidential
Library and Museum.

33:32.077 --> 33:33.110
Thank you, appreciate that.

33:33.112 --> 33:34.678
- Hi. Alex.
- Hey, Alex.

33:34.680 --> 33:37.147
My name's Cliff Laube, I'm
the public affairs officer here

33:37.149 --> 33:38.782
at the FDR Presidential Library.

33:38.784 --> 33:40.317
Perhaps you can clue us in,

33:40.319 --> 33:41.752
we're looking for an associate
of ours,

33:41.754 --> 33:44.121
a researcher by the name
of Paul Troutman?

33:44.123 --> 33:45.622
Yeah, right,
he's in our research room,

33:45.624 --> 33:47.624
- I can take you there now.
- Perfect.

33:49.194 --> 33:51.461
It's a beautiful,
beautiful building.

33:51.463 --> 33:53.330
<i>I was thoroughly impressed by</i>

33:53.332 --> 33:55.232
the FDR complex, if you will.

33:55.234 --> 33:58.168
<i>It housed not only
the FDR Museum,</i>

33:58.170 --> 34:01.038
<i>not only the-the research
facility,</i>

34:01.040 --> 34:04.174
<i>but the original home,
the original residence.</i>

34:04.176 --> 34:07.244
<i>And, what it spoke to me was,
what other knowledge,</i>

34:07.246 --> 34:10.514
<i>what other information will
be garnered from this trip?</i>

34:10.516 --> 34:13.516
<i>Will we glean some nugget
of information</i>

34:13.518 --> 34:17.054
about his involvement
with Oak Island?

34:17.056 --> 34:18.621
- Right this way.
- Thank you, Cliff.

34:18.623 --> 34:19.688
Paul.

34:19.690 --> 34:21.291
- Hey, Rick.
- Good to see ya.

34:21.293 --> 34:22.292
- How are ya?
- Thanks for coming.

34:22.293 --> 34:23.659
Thank you.

34:23.661 --> 34:25.462
<i>Researcher, Paul Troutman,</i>

34:25.464 --> 34:28.799
<i>has spent the last several
days scouring the library</i>

34:28.801 --> 34:30.600
<i>for any new information</i>

34:30.601 --> 34:33.503
<i>that might explain
what drove FDR,</i>

34:33.505 --> 34:36.540
<i>an acknowledged member
of the Freemasons,</i>

34:36.542 --> 34:38.675
<i>to devote so much of his life</i>

34:38.677 --> 34:41.578
<i>to the search for treasure
on Oak Island.</i>

34:41.580 --> 34:44.514
Of all the persons

34:44.516 --> 34:46.550
and personalities that were
involved in Oak Island,

34:46.552 --> 34:51.521
surely FDR is probably
the premier persona,

34:51.523 --> 34:54.458
if you will, that became
engaged in that process, so...

34:54.460 --> 34:55.859
He's a central figure, no doubt.

34:57.796 --> 35:01.098
For me it's the "why" of
FDR's involvement.

35:01.100 --> 35:03.266
What made him commit
to this endeavor?

35:03.268 --> 35:07.237
What kept him fascinated
by the Oak Island story?

35:07.239 --> 35:09.172
We need to get to the bottom
of it.

35:09.174 --> 35:11.374
So, the reason why I pulled
these boxes, specifically,

35:11.376 --> 35:14.211
is because these are his
personal files.

35:14.213 --> 35:16.279
If there's any reference
or lead,

35:16.281 --> 35:19.416
I would think they would be in
his personal letter collection.

35:19.418 --> 35:21.351
There's a lot of information
here.

35:21.353 --> 35:24.321
17 million pages,
and out of all those 17 million,

35:24.323 --> 35:25.856
they've only scanned 10%.

35:25.858 --> 35:27.424
- Really?
- So,

35:27.426 --> 35:28.892
there's quite
a few things to find.

35:30.529 --> 35:32.762
So, Alex, what do you think?

35:32.764 --> 35:34.898
Obviously, there's a lot of
stuff to go through here yet.

35:34.900 --> 35:37.667
I mean, looks like we've
got our work cut out for us.

35:37.669 --> 35:38.829
What do you say we get to it?

35:44.643 --> 35:45.876
On those computers over there,

35:45.878 --> 35:47.577
you can access the database.

35:47.579 --> 35:48.812
So that may be worth a look,
too.

35:48.814 --> 35:50.247
- Yeah.
- You wanna take over here?

35:50.249 --> 35:52.049
- Yeah.
- Okay.

35:52.050 --> 35:53.850
<i>While visiting
the presidential library</i>

35:53.852 --> 35:57.754
<i>of Franklin Delano Roosevelt
in Hyde Park, New York,</i>

35:57.756 --> 36:01.925
<i>Rick Lagina, his nephew Alex,
and researcher Paul Troutman,</i>

36:01.927 --> 36:05.629
<i>are searching for information
that could explain just</i>

36:05.631 --> 36:08.698
<i>why America's 32nd
President remained</i>

36:08.700 --> 36:11.535
<i>interested in the search for
treasure on Oak Island</i>

36:11.537 --> 36:14.171
<i>throughout his adult life.</i>

36:14.173 --> 36:19.643
<i>There were 17 million
sheaths of documents there.</i>

36:19.645 --> 36:22.812
<i>Most of which have not
yet been digitized,</i>

36:22.814 --> 36:25.949
so it's-it's a difficult
research agenda.

36:25.951 --> 36:29.486
Just to give you a sense of
what this collection is,

36:29.488 --> 36:31.521
it's called a president's
secretary's file,

36:31.523 --> 36:33.623
and these are the documents that
were so secret,

36:33.625 --> 36:34.858
personal or confidential
that they were

36:34.860 --> 36:37.260
kept in FDR's secretary's office

36:37.262 --> 36:38.862
rather than sent down to the
White House filing room.

36:38.864 --> 36:40.564
Interesting. Very interesting.

36:40.566 --> 36:41.698
- Yeah.
- I was hoping to find

36:41.700 --> 36:43.400
something from around the time

36:43.402 --> 36:45.368
when we know he made a
trip to Oak Island.

36:47.506 --> 36:49.272
<i>You know, between looking
through the archives here,</i>

36:49.274 --> 36:51.541
<i>trying to
track down the 90-foot stone,</i>

36:51.543 --> 36:54.277
<i>and even just sifting
through the spoils piles...</i>

36:54.279 --> 36:56.246
Okay, why don't we set you up
at one of the tables over here?

36:56.248 --> 36:57.747
Sure.

36:57.749 --> 36:59.716
We're not going to find
what we're looking for quickly.

36:59.718 --> 37:00.850
<i>It's going to take a lot
of work.</i>

37:00.852 --> 37:02.886
- Take a look.
- Great, thanks.

37:02.888 --> 37:04.321
<i>Going through the documents,</i>

37:04.323 --> 37:05.889
<i>it's a very tedious process,</i>

37:05.891 --> 37:08.892
<i>and my hat's off to every
researcher anywhere,</i>

37:08.894 --> 37:10.894
<i>researching anything.</i>

37:10.896 --> 37:14.331
You have to comb through volumes
of information

37:14.333 --> 37:16.233
to get one little treasure.

37:16.235 --> 37:20.003
All right, let me see what
I've got here.

37:20.005 --> 37:23.440
I was able to find
this reference in the database:

37:23.442 --> 37:26.943
It was called "Vertical Folder.
Oak Island, Nova Scotia."

37:26.945 --> 37:29.479
But, I was able to find
some photographs

37:29.481 --> 37:32.882
and some other documentation,
which we'll see here.

37:32.884 --> 37:36.553
Okay, this letter right here,

37:36.555 --> 37:39.389
it actually does mention
Oak Island in it.

37:39.391 --> 37:41.658
There's a man named
Richard Perkins,

37:41.660 --> 37:43.293
from Inglewood, California,

37:43.295 --> 37:46.630
who writes to the President
to confirm

37:46.632 --> 37:48.698
that there was an actual
expedition,

37:48.700 --> 37:51.701
and right here,
the secretary, M.A. LeHand,

37:51.703 --> 37:55.038
is confirming that this was 1909

37:55.040 --> 37:58.675
and that there might have
been more than one expedition.

37:58.677 --> 38:00.543
At least two.

38:00.545 --> 38:01.878
"It is true that the president
visited

38:01.880 --> 38:05.448
"in search for this often-sought
treasure about 1909.

38:05.450 --> 38:07.684
"There have been two
other expeditions, also,

38:07.686 --> 38:08.985
"but the President understands

38:08.987 --> 38:10.820
the treasure has never been
found."

38:10.822 --> 38:13.423
Wow! That's my
first understanding

38:13.425 --> 38:15.425
of that, I've never
heard of that.

38:15.427 --> 38:17.594
That is kind of amazing.

38:17.596 --> 38:19.963
The only one I had heard about
was 1909.

38:19.965 --> 38:21.598
And so, these, you know,
this is kinda

38:21.600 --> 38:23.600
the first anybody is really
seeing these.

38:23.602 --> 38:26.903
<i>Although Franklin
Delano Roosevelt</i>

38:26.905 --> 38:30.774
<i>did help finance,
and also took part in</i>

38:30.776 --> 38:34.711
<i>the search for treasure
on Oak Island in 1909,</i>

38:34.713 --> 38:36.446
<i>his family's involvement</i>

38:36.448 --> 38:39.983
<i>with the mystery goes back
much further.</i>

38:39.985 --> 38:45.622
<i>In 1849, Warren Delano,
FDR's grandfather,</i>

38:45.624 --> 38:48.358
<i>had been an adventurous
entrepreneur</i>

38:48.360 --> 38:52.028
<i>whose investments in goods such
as tea and the opium trade</i>

38:52.030 --> 38:54.464
<i>with China made his family among</i>

38:54.466 --> 38:56.800
<i>the wealthiest in the world.</i>

38:56.802 --> 39:00.403
<i>That year, his interest turned
to treasure hunting,</i>

39:00.405 --> 39:03.039
<i>and Delano became one of
several investors</i>

39:03.041 --> 39:04.941
<i>in the Truro Company,</i>

39:04.943 --> 39:08.478
<i>the same organization
that not only discovered</i>

39:08.480 --> 39:11.781
<i>the box drains at Smith's
Cove in 1850,</i>

39:11.783 --> 39:14.784
<i>but also small bits
of gold chain</i>

39:14.786 --> 39:17.854
<i>while drilling in the Money Pit.</i>

39:17.856 --> 39:20.056
I've always been curious
of the why,

39:20.058 --> 39:22.559
the why of the whole
Oak Island story,

39:22.561 --> 39:26.029
but in particular, why did FDR
choose to engage in it,

39:26.031 --> 39:29.699
why was he so enthralled
of the Oak Island story?

39:29.701 --> 39:31.868
Well, I might have the answer
to that in the next folder.

39:31.870 --> 39:32.936
- Right here?
- Yeah, great.

39:32.938 --> 39:36.639
- Absolutely.
- Scoot in here, Alex.

39:36.641 --> 39:38.975
This right here, this is
a biographer

39:38.977 --> 39:40.777
named Joseph P. Lash.

39:40.779 --> 39:44.681
He wrote a book, two books,
on FDR and Eleanor Roosevelt.

39:44.683 --> 39:47.751
One of the interviews is
with Duncan Harris.

39:47.753 --> 39:50.887
The one that we-we found
the Oak Island material on.

39:50.889 --> 39:55.125
He went to Harvard,
as well as FDR.

39:55.127 --> 39:56.960
It says, "Franklin and I"

39:56.962 --> 40:00.497
went after the Oak Island
treasure together."

40:00.499 --> 40:04.401
He went to Oak Island together,
with FDR.

40:04.403 --> 40:07.170
So, there is a distinct
possibility

40:07.172 --> 40:10.039
that he's actually
in the famous photograph.

40:10.041 --> 40:12.876
Now, of course, here is FDR.

40:12.878 --> 40:15.111
I'm not sure who Duncan
Harris is,

40:15.113 --> 40:17.046
but apparently, he's in
this photograph.

40:17.048 --> 40:18.715
Either on top or on bottom,

40:18.717 --> 40:20.450
but I think he'd be in
the front here,

40:20.452 --> 40:22.986
considering how close of
a friend he was.

40:22.988 --> 40:25.822
And in this statement,
he actually says,

40:25.824 --> 40:27.824
"It all started off for us,

40:27.826 --> 40:29.692
"on the treasure hunting
business,

40:29.694 --> 40:32.929
Franklin..." which is F,
"always interested in that.

40:32.931 --> 40:35.899
"He thought they were the lost
jewels of Louis the 16th

40:35.901 --> 40:38.034
and Marie Antoinette."

40:38.036 --> 40:42.839
So, these were
the lost crown jewels of France.

40:42.841 --> 40:45.141
So, he thought it was Louis
the 16th?

40:45.143 --> 40:49.078
That's remarkable!
Well, there's my "why" of it.

40:49.080 --> 40:52.715
<i>Marie Antoinette?</i>

40:52.717 --> 40:56.486
<i>The crown jewels of France?</i>

40:56.488 --> 41:00.190
<i>Of all the various theories,
perhaps none is as audacious,</i>

41:00.192 --> 41:04.594
<i>or compelling, as the one
suggesting that precious jewels</i>

41:04.596 --> 41:07.564
<i>could be buried on Oak Island.</i>

41:07.566 --> 41:11.034
<i>Or the claim that there isn't
only one treasure hidden there,</i>

41:11.036 --> 41:13.803
<i>but several.</i>

41:13.805 --> 41:16.673
<i>And that one of the guardians
of that information</i>

41:16.675 --> 41:19.776
<i>might well have been one
of America's most popular,</i>

41:19.778 --> 41:25.515
<i>and powerful, Presidents.</i>

41:25.517 --> 41:28.551
<i>Next time on
The Curse of Oak Island...</i>

41:28.553 --> 41:30.587
They're saying that
the Marie Antoinette jewels

41:30.589 --> 41:32.856
were buried in Canada.

41:32.858 --> 41:35.124
<i>There's more than
just an interesting treasure.</i>

41:35.126 --> 41:36.793
<i>FDR found answers.</i>

41:36.795 --> 41:38.728
I think we're into
something, Rick!

41:38.730 --> 41:41.698
<i>If there's a box drain,
it leads to the flood tunnel.</i>

41:41.700 --> 41:44.767
<i>It's proof that
the original story is true.</i>

41:44.769 --> 41:47.103
Whoa, wait, wait, wait, wait!
Rick, look at this.

41:47.105 --> 41:48.872
That doesn't look natural to me.

41:48.874 --> 41:51.541
If this is the shaft
they found the gold,

41:51.543 --> 41:52.642
<i>I think we should dig
right here.</i>

41:52.644 --> 41:54.043
<i>X marks the spot.</i>
