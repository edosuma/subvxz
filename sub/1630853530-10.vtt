00:14.014 --> 00:15.432
Altitude: 6.4 kilometers.

00:16.015 --> 00:17.518
Speed: 579 kilometers per hour.

00:20.229 --> 00:22.314
Block E at 2,050 kilograms.

00:22.898 --> 00:23.857
Ready for chute deploy.

00:24.900 --> 00:26.068
Too soon.

00:26.151 --> 00:27.736
We're in ballistic descent!

00:31.448 --> 00:32.448
Deploy pilot!

00:35.953 --> 00:37.120
Parachute cover won't release!

00:37.204 --> 00:38.247
Try again!

00:41.166 --> 00:42.626
Hatch ejected.

00:42.709 --> 00:44.002
Pilot chutes out.

00:44.086 --> 00:45.587
It's still going too fast!

00:45.671 --> 00:47.214
Brace for impact!

00:47.297 --> 00:48.590
Brace for impact!

00:49.091 --> 00:50.342
Brace for impact!

00:50.425 --> 00:51.426
Brace for impact!

03:04.059 --> 03:05.519
This is Lee Jung-Gil.

03:05.602 --> 03:09.815
I have completed the mission objective
in honor of our great nation.

03:09.898 --> 03:12.276
I will be waiting for your response.
Transmission over.

03:25.873 --> 03:27.541
This is Lee Jung-Gil.

03:27.624 --> 03:31.003
I have completed the mission objective
in honor of our great nation.

03:31.753 --> 03:33.463
I will be waiting for your response.

03:33.547 --> 03:34.548
Transmission over.

03:41.972 --> 03:43.182
This is Lee Jung-Gil.

03:43.265 --> 03:46.435
I have completed the mission objective
in honor of our great nation.

03:47.102 --> 03:48.437
I will be waiting for your response.

03:48.520 --> 03:49.688
Transmission over.

04:15.005 --> 04:16.632
This is Lee Jung-Gil.

04:16.714 --> 04:19.760
I have completed the mission objective
in honor of our great nation.

04:20.719 --> 04:22.387
I will be waiting for your response.

04:22.471 --> 04:23.305
Transmission over.

04:33.315 --> 04:34.858
This is Lee Jung-Gil.

04:34.942 --> 04:38.445
I have completed the mission objective
in honor of our great nation.

04:39.071 --> 04:40.405
I will be waiting for your response.

04:40.989 --> 04:41.990
Transmission over.

05:27.411 --> 05:30.455
Analysis of soil sample 134

05:30.539 --> 05:32.958
shows high levels of magnesium.

05:33.750 --> 05:35.085
I will be waiting for your response.

05:35.794 --> 05:36.837
Transmission over.

09:31.071 --> 09:32.823
Get away from my ship!

09:33.407 --> 09:36.493
This is territory of
the People's Republic Of Korea!

09:38.036 --> 09:39.413
Get away from my ship!

09:39.496 --> 09:40.497
What do you want here?

09:40.581 --> 09:42.165
Don't shoot.

09:42.249 --> 09:43.292
You are trespassing!

09:43.375 --> 09:45.210
-We just came--
-Step back!

09:45.294 --> 09:46.712
What are you after?

09:47.963 --> 09:49.506
You will not take my ship!

09:49.590 --> 09:50.883
Stay back!

09:51.466 --> 09:52.551
Stay back!

11:24.560 --> 11:27.104
Madam President,
the vice president is here to see you.

11:27.855 --> 11:28.856
Send him in.

11:33.902 --> 11:34.903
Hello, Jim.

11:35.404 --> 11:36.572
Madam President.

11:39.783 --> 11:42.494
After yesterday's statement,

11:43.787 --> 11:46.123
you need to know
the reality of the situation.

11:46.957 --> 11:47.958
Of course.

11:50.752 --> 11:54.173
Talk of impeachment has been gaining
a great deal of momentum.

11:54.882 --> 11:57.301
Almost all Republicans
in both houses of the Congress

11:57.384 --> 11:59.178
are strongly in favor.

11:59.261 --> 12:04.057
They feel betrayed, lied to.

12:04.141 --> 12:06.310
I'm pretty sure being dishonest
about my sexuality

12:06.393 --> 12:08.353
falls short of high crimes
and misdemeanors.

12:09.646 --> 12:15.736
I think it would be wise to spare yourself
and this country the humiliation

12:15.819 --> 12:20.240
of a nasty impeachment proceeding
and assured conviction in the Senate.

12:27.414 --> 12:28.832
It takes a two-thirds vote.

12:29.708 --> 12:32.336
With enough Democratic support,
I could survive a trial in the Senate.

12:32.419 --> 12:34.546
You wanna put your fate
in the hands of a party

12:34.630 --> 12:37.090
we've been fighting tooth and nail
for the last two years?

12:39.259 --> 12:40.761
What are you suggesting, Jim?

12:42.179 --> 12:43.764
That you resign from office.

12:44.389 --> 12:49.019
And save the Republican Party
from an apocalypse in the next election.

12:49.102 --> 12:51.855
And I'm sure you're ready
and willing to replace me?

12:51.939 --> 12:55.692
This has nothing to do with what I want.
We are under assault.

12:55.776 --> 12:57.736
I'm under assault.

12:57.819 --> 13:01.406
I will do everything in my power
to protect your legacy.

13:01.490 --> 13:02.533
I assure you of that.

13:06.453 --> 13:08.372
You don't give a shit about my legacy.

13:09.122 --> 13:10.457
Or me.

13:10.541 --> 13:12.000
I know for a fact you're already planning

13:12.084 --> 13:13.836
to support the Speaker's bill
to defund NASA.

13:13.919 --> 13:15.546
Well, I'm sorry to state the obvious,

13:15.629 --> 13:19.341
but if you haven't noticed,
Mars is an abject disaster.

13:19.925 --> 13:22.344
It has been a circus from the start.

13:22.427 --> 13:25.055
First Will Tyler,
then this Russian love child.

13:25.138 --> 13:28.141
Not to mention the fact
that seven people have died.

13:28.225 --> 13:30.352
We didn't do these things
because they are easy,

13:30.435 --> 13:32.771
but because they are hard.

13:34.273 --> 13:37.609
I won't allow you to destroy
everything we've worked so hard to build.

13:37.693 --> 13:41.780
And I won't allow you
to destroy the Republican Party.

13:41.864 --> 13:44.283
Maybe it needs a little destroying.

13:51.373 --> 13:53.709
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have work to do.

14:18.192 --> 14:20.277
Molly. Hi. It's Karen.

14:21.445 --> 14:26.533
Wayne got stuck at a student
conference thingy.

14:27.284 --> 14:28.493
Feel free to wait.

14:29.536 --> 14:30.913
-Okay.
-Have a seat.

14:32.831 --> 14:33.874
Or not.

14:34.666 --> 14:36.084
I don't care.

14:47.804 --> 14:49.932
Wow, Molly. This painting is fantastic.

14:50.682 --> 14:51.975
Those are Wayne's over there.

15:21.129 --> 15:24.132
Okay. I can't do this. I can't focus.

15:25.175 --> 15:27.511
I can feel your anxiety from here.

15:27.594 --> 15:30.848
-Okay. I can go if you'd like, and--
-Cough it up. What's the issue?

15:33.976 --> 15:36.770
If it's okay, I would rather
just talk to Wayne about it.

15:36.854 --> 15:39.648
Trust me.
I'd rather you talk to Wayne too.

15:39.731 --> 15:43.944
But I'm here and you're here.
So, what's the problem?

15:48.073 --> 15:49.074
Okay.

15:53.912 --> 15:59.209
I work at Helios with Dev Ayesa,
and I am--

15:59.293 --> 16:02.546
COO. Yep, Wayne told me. Cut to the meat.

16:03.755 --> 16:05.674
-Okay. The meat.
-The point.

16:05.757 --> 16:06.800
Yes.

16:08.594 --> 16:13.015
The board came to me
and asked me to be CEO.

16:16.727 --> 16:18.687
-This is the problem?
-Yes.

16:19.897 --> 16:23.358
Dev is CEO. He founded Helios.

16:23.442 --> 16:25.068
He was the one who brought me in

16:25.152 --> 16:27.237
after everything that happened
with Polaris and--

16:27.321 --> 16:28.822
So you feel like you owe him?

16:29.573 --> 16:31.283
Yes. I do owe him.

16:31.366 --> 16:33.202
-Do you want it?
-That's beside the point.

16:33.285 --> 16:36.413
It's exactly the point.
Do you want it or not?

16:42.920 --> 16:47.132
-Yes. I do. I do want it. But I--
-So you remember Apollo 15?

16:47.216 --> 16:50.177
-How could I forget?
-So that was Gordo's flight.

16:50.260 --> 16:53.347
Gordo had been training for more
than a year to find ice on the moon.

16:53.430 --> 16:56.016
And when Deke said
that he was putting me on,

16:56.099 --> 16:58.685
do you think I hemmed and hawed?

16:59.269 --> 17:04.608
You think I was like, "I can't.
What will Gordo say? What if he's hurt?"

17:04.691 --> 17:08.278
Fuck that! I said, "Yeah. Sign me up."

17:08.362 --> 17:10.239
Yes, Molly. Of course you did
because you're a--

17:10.321 --> 17:11.490
Selfish prick.

17:12.991 --> 17:16.328
No. I was going to say
that you're a force of nature and--

17:16.411 --> 17:18.914
No. I'm a selfish prick. That's okay.

17:19.414 --> 17:21.040
Selfish pricks change the world.

17:22.000 --> 17:23.126
Your ex-husband is one.

17:23.210 --> 17:25.253
Dev Ayesa, I guarantee you,

17:25.337 --> 17:28.214
is a card-carrying member
of the Selfish Prick Club.

17:30.342 --> 17:35.597
And deep down, much as you
try to hide it, you are too.

17:54.116 --> 17:55.784
Is the baby okay?

17:55.868 --> 17:58.287
The test results will tell us more.

18:02.916 --> 18:04.251
I'll be right back.

18:11.383 --> 18:12.384
Hey.

18:18.182 --> 18:19.433
What's going on?

18:20.559 --> 18:24.813
With the preeclampsia, the baby is not
getting enough blood through the uterus.

18:28.150 --> 18:29.359
Jesus.

18:29.443 --> 18:30.777
And Kelly?

18:30.861 --> 18:34.531
Her blood pressure is high. It's too high.

18:34.615 --> 18:37.618
We need to deliver the baby
to save both their lives.

18:41.914 --> 18:46.793
I can'tâ€¦ lose her.
You understand that, Dimitri?

18:46.877 --> 18:48.587
I'm doing everything I can, Edward.

18:49.546 --> 18:52.007
But I don't have the appropriate
equipment for this here.

18:52.508 --> 18:55.385
The fetus will be premature
by at least a month.

18:56.303 --> 18:57.679
Meaning what?

18:57.763 --> 19:01.308
That we must get her and the baby
up to Phoenix as soon as possible.

19:01.391 --> 19:04.102
They have a ventilator
and magnesium for her toxemia.

19:04.770 --> 19:09.024
But we don't have enough fuel
to launch the MSAM for another month.

19:10.108 --> 19:13.862
If we don't deliver the baby in the next
24 hours, both of them could die.

19:24.540 --> 19:27.167
Rover One, Happy Valley, come in.

19:28.085 --> 19:32.506
Rover One, Happy Valley.
Poole, Kuznetsov, come in.

19:41.473 --> 19:43.809
I thought this was
supposed to be an unmanned probe.

19:43.892 --> 19:48.146
So did we.
They kept it secret in case of failure.

19:50.607 --> 19:53.235
They probably think he's dead.
Poor bastard.

19:57.948 --> 20:01.535
Wait a second.
Didn't they launch in September?

20:04.454 --> 20:07.291
So they landed on Mars before us.

20:09.918 --> 20:12.588
He landed on Mars before us.

20:13.255 --> 20:16.008
He was first man on Mars?

20:16.842 --> 20:18.468
Motherfucker.

20:18.552 --> 20:19.761
Wow.

20:26.351 --> 20:27.352
Right.

20:38.280 --> 20:40.073
You sure you don't speak any Korean?

20:40.574 --> 20:43.493
I thought Russia and North Korea
were supposed to be best buds.

20:44.411 --> 20:45.954
Anyway, it makes no difference.

20:46.038 --> 20:48.123
He's not on our frequency.
He can't hear us.

20:49.291 --> 20:51.710
Well, what are we gonna do?
We can't just sit here.

20:53.003 --> 20:54.087
Wellâ€¦

20:56.215 --> 20:57.633
if we rush him,

20:58.592 --> 21:00.761
together, at the same time,

21:02.346 --> 21:03.972
he can only shoot one of us.

21:04.806 --> 21:06.517
Tell me that's not your best idea.

21:07.392 --> 21:08.644
Do you have a better one?

21:19.363 --> 21:21.073
Maybe we don't need words.

21:26.578 --> 21:28.705
What are you doing, Danielle?

21:29.373 --> 21:31.542
I'm not quite sure yet.

21:38.966 --> 21:40.133
Okayâ€¦

21:43.554 --> 21:44.555
Okay.

21:46.807 --> 21:52.980
We need to borrow a part of your ship.

21:56.191 --> 21:57.401
Yeah.

21:57.484 --> 22:00.612
So, this is your ship.

22:01.613 --> 22:07.119
We need a part of it,
so that we canâ€¦ leave.

22:09.121 --> 22:10.372
What about this?

22:12.291 --> 22:14.543
So that weâ€¦

22:18.505 --> 22:19.715
can go home.

22:21.466 --> 22:22.384
Yeah?

22:23.093 --> 22:24.094
Home?

22:25.679 --> 22:27.222
Home. Yeah.

22:27.806 --> 22:30.392
Yes! So that we can go-- Yes.

22:30.475 --> 22:33.145
Wait! What-- Kuz, goddamn it.

22:37.774 --> 22:39.610
I'm trying to-- Wait.

22:39.693 --> 22:40.777
Give me this.

22:42.446 --> 22:43.655
Got it.

22:44.489 --> 22:47.075
Okay.

22:50.454 --> 22:51.455
What was that?

22:52.247 --> 22:53.957
You're right. We don't need words.

23:27.699 --> 23:30.702
Happy Valley? Rover One.
Happy Valley, do you copy?

23:30.786 --> 23:32.746
Danielle, are you guys okay?

23:32.829 --> 23:33.872
Yep. We're okay.

23:33.956 --> 23:35.707
Did you get the Kurs system?

23:35.791 --> 23:37.543
Yeah, we got it,
and we're headed back.

23:37.626 --> 23:39.169
But there's something else
you should know.

23:41.797 --> 23:43.632
How is this even possible, Mikhail?

23:43.715 --> 23:46.385
They can barely launch a satellite
into orbit.

23:46.468 --> 23:47.928
Our friends in North Korea

23:48.011 --> 23:52.015
have always been eager
to prove they are world power.

23:53.433 --> 23:57.896
I mean, what do we even call him?
Is he a refugee? A prisoner?

23:57.980 --> 23:59.439
Secretary Bush is concerned

23:59.523 --> 24:02.025
the North Koreans will interpret this
as a hostile act.

24:02.693 --> 24:07.197
I will speak to the Chairman.
They still need patronage of USSR.

24:07.281 --> 24:10.701
Just get their cosmonaut home
in one piece.

24:10.784 --> 24:12.035
You have a deal, Mikhail.

24:12.870 --> 24:17.666
And, may I add, your political troubles?

24:18.876 --> 24:21.837
No. You don't have to--

24:21.920 --> 24:25.424
There is famous Russian saying.

24:25.507 --> 24:27.384
In English it would be,

24:28.927 --> 24:33.015
"I ran from the wolf,
but ran into the bear."

24:35.475 --> 24:36.476
A bear indeed.

24:37.811 --> 24:39.021
Good luck.

24:40.480 --> 24:41.481
Thank you.

24:43.108 --> 24:44.193
Goodbye, Mikhail.

24:56.705 --> 24:59.791
We've got a lot going on here,
as I'm sure you're aware.

24:59.875 --> 25:04.213
So, to what do I owe
this unscheduled visit, Ms. Catiche?

25:06.048 --> 25:09.718
I have a sensitive matter to discuss.

25:09.801 --> 25:11.553
If this is about
our new North Korean guest--

25:11.637 --> 25:12.638
It's not.

25:12.721 --> 25:14.723
Well, I'm in the middle of
planning a rescue mission.

25:14.806 --> 25:16.767
You're being investigated, Margo.

25:23.899 --> 25:25.400
Excuse me?

25:25.484 --> 25:29.655
We have an asset
inside your Justice Department.

25:30.697 --> 25:35.494
And they have alerted us that you're
currently being investigated by FBI.

25:36.495 --> 25:38.872
Someone from NASA is talking to them.

25:40.958 --> 25:41.959
Who?

25:44.670 --> 25:45.963
Aleida Rosales.

25:47.631 --> 25:50.926
From what our asset
has been able to gather,

25:51.009 --> 25:53.887
federal agents are preparing
to make an arrest very soon.

25:56.723 --> 25:58.267
Margo, we can help you.

25:58.350 --> 25:59.977
I've seen how you help people.

26:00.060 --> 26:02.145
If you do nothing, you will get arrested.

26:02.229 --> 26:06.441
You will spend the next 40 years
of your life in a penitentiary.

26:06.525 --> 26:07.943
Is that what you want?

26:12.281 --> 26:15.534
Sojourner still has plenty of LH2.

26:15.617 --> 26:18.704
Their habs could be used
to synthesize the methane faster.

26:18.787 --> 26:20.455
Okay, that's promising.

26:20.539 --> 26:23.709
We're limited by the rate we can pull
CO2 from the Martian atmosphere.

26:24.751 --> 26:26.253
Can I borrow you for a second?

26:26.879 --> 26:28.255
Sure. I'll be right back.

26:29.047 --> 26:30.549
We're gonna head to JSC soon.

26:30.632 --> 26:32.176
-Okay. Go ahead. I'll meet you there.
-Yeah.

26:33.635 --> 26:34.720
Yeah.

26:36.180 --> 26:37.389
So how you holding up?

26:38.807 --> 26:39.892
-Fine.
-Yeah?

26:39.975 --> 26:41.435
Fine. Yeah, I am.

26:41.518 --> 26:44.938
I'll be better once Kelly
gets safely up to the Phoenix.

26:45.022 --> 26:46.773
And we'll get her there.

26:46.857 --> 26:51.653
Okay, so I just wanted to give you
the heads-up that it looks like

26:51.737 --> 26:53.614
the bastards are about to make their move.

26:54.531 --> 26:55.574
Who?

26:56.533 --> 26:57.618
The board.

26:58.702 --> 27:00.662
They're trying to take Helios from us.

27:00.746 --> 27:04.166
So, we cannot sit around
and wait for them to take control.

27:04.917 --> 27:06.752
I've been talking
to some international partners.

27:06.835 --> 27:08.378
-Hey, Dev. I--
-Hold on a second. Listen.

27:08.462 --> 27:10.547
I've been talking to some
international partners,

27:10.631 --> 27:12.591
and they're really interested
in what we got going on.

27:12.674 --> 27:13.675
They're hedging a little bit,

27:13.759 --> 27:15.677
-in light of everything that we--
-Dev.

27:17.846 --> 27:19.014
What?

27:19.515 --> 27:20.849
The board approached me.

27:22.392 --> 27:24.102
They asked me to be CEO.

27:31.235 --> 27:32.236
What'd you say?

27:32.945 --> 27:34.488
I said I need to think about it.

27:36.198 --> 27:37.199
Have you?

27:42.579 --> 27:45.749
I believe in this company. Dev, I do.

27:45.832 --> 27:48.710
I believe in what we have built
and what we are building.

27:48.794 --> 27:52.965
But what it needs right now
is a steady hand.

27:56.260 --> 27:57.636
-Dev, I want you--
-No.

27:57.719 --> 27:59.763
-I want you to know that--
-Don't apologize.

28:00.931 --> 28:02.057
This is on me.

28:02.683 --> 28:05.143
I never should've broken
from our core collective principles.

28:05.227 --> 28:07.521
Giving you your office, your title,
everything that you asked for

28:07.604 --> 28:09.690
that corrupted everything
that this company stands for.

28:09.773 --> 28:11.984
Dev, we both know
that this has nothing to do

28:12.067 --> 28:14.611
with some abstract notion of togetherness.

28:14.695 --> 28:17.239
Okay, it doesn't? So what does it
have to do with then, Karen?

28:17.322 --> 28:18.323
Enlighten me.

28:19.950 --> 28:20.951
You.

28:21.869 --> 28:24.454
Dev, over the last few months,

28:25.122 --> 28:29.459
your erratic behavior,
your decision-making, your--

28:29.543 --> 28:35.090
your inability to adjust based on setbacks
has put our financial health at risk.

28:35.174 --> 28:39.178
This is about the future of our company.

28:39.261 --> 28:42.055
About the people that you claim
to care so much about.

28:42.639 --> 28:45.684
So you're doing this for them?
No one else?

28:49.521 --> 28:50.522
No.

28:52.232 --> 28:55.569
I'm doing it for me too.
But tell me what's wrong with that, huh?

28:56.403 --> 28:58.197
I have worked my ass off to get here.

28:58.280 --> 29:02.284
-Now you're taking your pound of flesh.
-This is not how I want it to be, okay?

29:03.452 --> 29:08.040
Dev, I want you to stay on with us, okay?
With me, you have a seat on the board.

29:08.123 --> 29:10.709
We continue to build
what we have been together.

29:10.792 --> 29:12.586
And watch you pillage my company?

29:15.672 --> 29:16.757
Sell it off for parts?

29:20.385 --> 29:21.720
No, thank you.

29:34.191 --> 29:35.776
NASA's working the problem, butâ€¦

29:38.820 --> 29:39.988
It's not coming easy.

29:40.572 --> 29:43.575
To be able to launch
with the fuel we have on hand,

29:43.659 --> 29:46.078
we need to cut a lot more weight
out of the MSAM.

29:47.621 --> 29:50.541
Is there anything else
we can take out of Popeye?

29:51.500 --> 29:54.419
-How much do we need?
-NASA says a thousand pounds.

29:59.049 --> 30:00.968
We've already taken out most of the seats.

30:01.051 --> 30:03.220
Cut out all the nonessential hardware.
There's--

30:04.096 --> 30:06.515
There's nothing really else,
if the thing still needs to fly.

30:08.225 --> 30:10.352
There is one more thing left to pull.

30:13.021 --> 30:14.022
What?

30:17.526 --> 30:18.819
Us.

30:18.902 --> 30:20.529
We are the weight.

30:27.911 --> 30:29.496
Nine of us.

30:29.580 --> 30:31.582
That's a thousand pounds, give or take.

30:31.665 --> 30:34.126
What? No.

30:35.002 --> 30:37.838
If we stay, Kelly can go.

30:37.921 --> 30:40.507
No. That's not even--

30:40.591 --> 30:43.677
It means we'll have to wait
for Sojourner 2 to pick us up.

30:43.760 --> 30:46.805
That's a year and a half from now.

30:46.889 --> 30:48.432
This is crazy.

30:49.266 --> 30:51.852
You can't do this.
There isn't enough food to last that long.

30:53.645 --> 30:56.857
Well, if we institute
strict rationing of all our MREs

30:56.940 --> 31:00.694
and Kelly's crops in the jungle
keep growing at the rate they've beenâ€¦

31:02.613 --> 31:06.116
Yeah, I mean, it'll be rough.
But maybe we could make it work.

31:06.200 --> 31:07.701
Absolutely not.

31:08.619 --> 31:10.537
I am not letting any of you
make that choice.

31:10.621 --> 31:14.958
We'll just have to figure something else
out orâ€¦ I don't know.

31:16.168 --> 31:19.046
Dimitri, is there any way
to give birth down here?

31:19.129 --> 31:21.882
I'm sorry. There is not.

31:28.180 --> 31:29.181
I'm staying.

31:30.349 --> 31:32.935
Danny. No.

31:34.895 --> 31:36.230
I'm gonna stay too.

31:38.357 --> 31:40.692
-I will stay also.
-And me.

31:42.819 --> 31:44.071
This is insane.

31:46.907 --> 31:48.784
You can't survive here that long.

31:49.368 --> 31:50.536
Don't do this.

32:08.345 --> 32:11.765
There's been a lot of talk down there
about giving up on Mars.

32:11.849 --> 32:17.020
But as hard as it's been, and as much
as we grieve the ones we lost,

32:17.104 --> 32:19.565
all that would be for nothing
if we gave up now.

32:19.648 --> 32:21.984
So, we're going to get Kelly to Phoenix,

32:22.067 --> 32:24.027
and you're gonna have to come get usâ€¦

32:24.987 --> 32:26.613
'cause we're not going anywhere.

32:27.656 --> 32:28.866
Happy Valley out.

32:36.957 --> 32:38.375
Get me the president.

32:40.002 --> 32:42.713
Check. One, two, check.
How's that level, Brandon?

32:42.796 --> 32:43.881
Okay, good.

32:43.964 --> 32:46.717
I'm live here outside Johnson Space Center
where we have just heardâ€¦

32:46.800 --> 32:48.760
Kelly Baldwin and her unborn child
are gonna be launched

32:48.844 --> 32:51.555
to needed medical facilities
aboard the orbiting Phoenix craft.

32:51.638 --> 32:54.641
This shocking development comes live
here at the Johnson Space Center

32:54.725 --> 32:56.310
where hundreds have gatheredâ€¦

33:02.816 --> 33:07.154
After you get inside support room 329,
look for the video patch panel.

33:07.237 --> 33:09.907
Unplug the cable connected to switcher one

33:09.990 --> 33:12.117
and plug in this transceiver.

33:13.118 --> 33:17.122
Then Sunny'll be able to upload the video
we record from the camera out here.

33:17.206 --> 33:18.707
Easy-peasy.

33:21.877 --> 33:24.379
Are we sure this is the right time
to be doing this?

33:25.088 --> 33:26.340
It's the perfect time.

33:27.466 --> 33:29.551
All eyes are on NASA right now.

33:29.635 --> 33:33.472
It's gonna show everyone
what a corrupt institution this really is.

33:34.348 --> 33:36.475
We're gonna change the world today, Jim.

33:37.142 --> 33:39.394
And give your parents
the justice they deserve.

33:42.481 --> 33:43.482
You good?

33:47.236 --> 33:48.362
Yeah.

33:54.535 --> 33:57.246
â€¦medical facility aboard
the orbiting Phoenix craft.

33:57.329 --> 33:59.498
We will have the very latest
on this very sh--

34:00.874 --> 34:05.295
Even reducing
from nine MSAM passengers down to one,

34:05.379 --> 34:07.422
with our current propellant on handâ€¦

34:08.799 --> 34:12.553
we are still only at 95.3%.

34:12.636 --> 34:15.848
Ninety-five percent.
You've gotta be kidding me.

34:15.931 --> 34:18.308
-It's better than 80%.
-Who cares?

34:18.391 --> 34:22.855
You can't get 95% of the way
to Phoenix. It's 100% or nothing.

34:29.444 --> 34:30.571
Aleida.

34:34.032 --> 34:36.451
Step outside with me for a minute.

34:50.674 --> 34:51.675
Margo, I--

34:51.757 --> 34:53.051
I need your focus here.

34:53.135 --> 34:54.428
I know. I'm--

34:55.179 --> 34:57.347
I need to talk to you about something.

34:58.098 --> 35:01.977
I know, Aleida, about the investigation.

35:06.690 --> 35:08.483
-You do?
-Yes.

35:09.359 --> 35:13.488
I'm sorry you got pulled into this.
That was never my intention.

35:14.823 --> 35:17.784
Believe me. I tried to stop it.

35:24.124 --> 35:25.417
Why'd you do it?

35:28.128 --> 35:29.505
Why'd you help them?

35:37.804 --> 35:39.973
After all this is over, we'll talk.

35:41.475 --> 35:43.727
But right now, we're running out of time.

35:44.478 --> 35:46.563
And I need you in there.

36:01.036 --> 36:03.580
-You mean before or afterâ€¦
-Come on.

36:03.664 --> 36:07.125
â€¦you crashed your ship into the surface,
making it useless for everyone.

36:07.209 --> 36:08.877
You guys brought down a mountain.

36:08.961 --> 36:10.337
All right.

36:10.921 --> 36:13.298
Let's just go ahead and accept

36:14.716 --> 36:18.262
that the MSAM will only

36:19.304 --> 36:22.683
get us to 95% orbital velocity.

36:23.767 --> 36:27.437
So, how do we get
the last 5% of the way there?

36:28.647 --> 36:34.778
I mean, if we had time to build a second
stage to MSAM, with a different fuel,

36:34.862 --> 36:37.573
we'd be gold. But we don't.

36:37.656 --> 36:39.241
Maybe we do.

36:41.827 --> 36:43.662
She's the second stage.

36:44.413 --> 36:46.373
-What?
-Kelly.

36:46.456 --> 36:47.541
How is that even--

36:47.624 --> 36:49.835
We give her
an independent propulsion system.

36:50.502 --> 36:51.545
The PMU.

36:53.130 --> 36:55.215
They should still have that
aboard Sojourner.

36:56.425 --> 36:57.885
And she's trained to use it.

36:57.968 --> 37:01.180
The propulsive mobility unit
was designed to get an astronaut

37:01.263 --> 37:03.974
back and forth
along the hull of Sojourner.

37:04.057 --> 37:06.351
It doesn't have enough thrust
to get her to Phoenix.

37:06.435 --> 37:11.190
It's not about thrust. It's about impulse.
We just need a bigger gas tank.

37:11.273 --> 37:12.649
Now if we can find a way

37:12.733 --> 37:15.402
to connect all the backup propellant tanks
to the PMU,

37:16.236 --> 37:22.492
then she can get the velocity
she needs to get into orbit.

37:22.576 --> 37:28.207
I'm sorry. Are you suggesting
we light Kelly Baldwin up like a rocket?

37:29.499 --> 37:30.501
Basically.

37:34.796 --> 37:39.384
Steven, take a spare PMU pack
and some backup prop tanks to building 7.

37:39.468 --> 37:42.846
Figure out a way to connect the tanks
and go get us that last 5%.

37:42.930 --> 37:44.431
Got it.

37:44.515 --> 37:46.308
Bill, if this is gonna work,

37:46.391 --> 37:50.479
she's gonna have to be outside
on top of the MSAM for separation.

37:50.562 --> 37:52.314
You and your team figure out

37:52.397 --> 37:53.941
-how we're gonna pull that off.
-Let's go.

37:54.024 --> 37:57.861
And I want people in the sims
working out every possible scenario here.

37:57.945 --> 38:00.822
She's not gonna have
any guidance or navigation,

38:00.906 --> 38:02.824
so she'll have to do
the rendezvous visually.

38:04.117 --> 38:05.118
Let's move.

38:22.845 --> 38:24.263
All right. Bring it in, everybody.

38:34.606 --> 38:39.027
I just wanna let you all know that
the board of directors is going to ask me

38:39.111 --> 38:41.822
to resign my position
as CEO of this company.

38:45.617 --> 38:47.494
Karen Baldwin will be taking my place.

38:47.578 --> 38:48.704
-Huh?
-Can't be serious.

38:48.787 --> 38:52.541
They think we should turn our eyes
away from Mars.

38:53.125 --> 38:55.878
Refocus on our helium-3 lunar mining.

38:55.961 --> 38:58.297
That's where the money is.

38:59.715 --> 39:03.051
And I'm not gonna lie to you guys,
it's a lot of money.

39:04.428 --> 39:05.846
And given the recent setbacks,

39:05.929 --> 39:08.473
they think that we pushed too far,
too fast.

39:08.557 --> 39:09.975
That we should retreat.

39:11.143 --> 39:12.853
But that's not who we are.

39:13.562 --> 39:15.981
-No.
-Is it?

39:16.064 --> 39:17.649
This is bullshit, Dev.

39:18.192 --> 39:19.776
They can't do this.

39:21.778 --> 39:23.030
My friends,

39:23.947 --> 39:27.784
Helios has been the great work of my life.

39:28.368 --> 39:29.453
Of all our lives.

39:30.871 --> 39:32.539
But at the end of the day,

39:33.916 --> 39:35.959
Helios is just a name on a building.

39:36.502 --> 39:40.380
And what we've accomplished
is more than just a name.

39:40.464 --> 39:44.885
-Yeah, that's true.
-It's a revolution. Made up of all of us.

39:45.594 --> 39:46.803
Together.

39:49.389 --> 39:55.395
We can and we will start over.

39:55.479 --> 39:56.855
Yeah. That's right.

39:56.939 --> 39:58.815
But this time, we'll do it right.

40:00.108 --> 40:03.195
No board of directors.
No board of anything.

40:03.946 --> 40:06.031
You will be the board of directors.

40:09.243 --> 40:12.996
We will not turn our back to Mars. No!

40:13.080 --> 40:14.623
We will double down.

40:14.706 --> 40:18.377
More bases, more missions,
more everything.

40:18.460 --> 40:19.962
This is only the beginning.

40:24.716 --> 40:25.926
I have a question.

40:29.555 --> 40:32.474
For those who choose to follow you
on this new venture,

40:33.350 --> 40:35.811
will they be compensated
the same as they are now?

40:38.188 --> 40:39.815
Thank you for your concern, Karen.

40:40.649 --> 40:45.279
Yes, there will be some initial pay cuts
as we get our feet underneath us.

40:45.362 --> 40:46.738
This is just me being honest with you.

40:46.822 --> 40:50.367
-What are we talking about?
-Yeah, how much of a pay cut?

40:50.450 --> 40:53.203
Are we talking 10%, 15%?

40:53.287 --> 40:54.913
We're not in this for the money.

40:54.997 --> 40:56.999
-We need to stick together.
-Speak for yourself.

40:57.082 --> 40:58.876
What about our stock options, Dev?

40:58.959 --> 40:59.960
Stock options?

41:00.043 --> 41:04.506
Yeah. If we quit, we lose
our stock options in Helios, right?

41:04.590 --> 41:07.176
-I don't know if that's true, but--
-Ted's right. They'd be void.

41:07.259 --> 41:09.803
That's, like, a hundred grand
we'd be walking away from.

41:09.887 --> 41:11.889
-Okay.
-I can't just jump ship.

41:11.972 --> 41:13.974
I can't do that. That's a lot of money.

41:14.057 --> 41:17.144
Okay. People.

41:17.686 --> 41:20.272
This is not about money.

41:20.355 --> 41:21.565
This is not about any one of us.

41:21.648 --> 41:26.528
This is about all of us
striving for something greater.

41:26.612 --> 41:29.948
But that's pretty easy for you to say,
Dev.

41:30.032 --> 41:31.617
I mean, you're, like, rich.

41:31.700 --> 41:34.328
-I just want a house.
-I'm paying student loans.

41:34.411 --> 41:35.621
My mortgage.

42:18.830 --> 42:20.457
From the top of the MSAM?

42:22.000 --> 42:23.460
That's insane.

42:23.544 --> 42:25.128
Yeah, maybe, butâ€¦

42:26.839 --> 42:27.798
that's the plan.

42:30.092 --> 42:31.260
You can do this, Kel.

42:32.928 --> 42:36.181
Remember there's almost no atmosphere,
so launching in the open

42:36.265 --> 42:39.351
will be kind of like riding
in the back of the LSAM on the moon.

42:40.352 --> 42:43.856
And you've had more training
in the PMU than anyone up here.

42:45.858 --> 42:47.526
It'll be just like another EVA.

42:47.609 --> 42:49.653
More like being shot out a cannon.

42:50.487 --> 42:51.488
Wellâ€¦

42:53.699 --> 42:59.246
But if this is what it takes to keep
my baby safe, then it's what I'm gonna do.

43:02.708 --> 43:03.709
That's my girl.

43:06.962 --> 43:11.466
But if I'm on top of the MSAM,
how am I gonna fly it?

43:12.384 --> 43:13.927
Well, you're not.

43:14.928 --> 43:16.054
I am.

43:18.098 --> 43:20.142
No, that's--

43:21.518 --> 43:23.937
We'd use almost all the prop.

43:24.021 --> 43:26.732
There'll be nothing left for your landing,
you'll crash into the surface.

43:27.316 --> 43:29.526
I'm not gonna let anyone else
put themselves on the line

43:29.610 --> 43:31.528
for you and Ed Junior.

43:33.947 --> 43:35.073
Don't worry.

43:36.575 --> 43:37.576
I'm talking to Houston,

43:37.659 --> 43:40.287
and we're gonna figure out
a way for me to get back down safe.

43:42.873 --> 43:45.834
And I got the best pilot I know
to help us out.

44:08.774 --> 44:11.068
All right.

44:11.151 --> 44:12.861
That's enough of that shit.

44:12.945 --> 44:14.655
Let's get this show on the road.

44:15.364 --> 44:16.990
Where's the queen of darkness?

44:20.744 --> 44:22.246
Hello, Molly.

44:23.121 --> 44:24.873
How I missed that voice.

44:25.749 --> 44:28.460
I hear Ed Baldwin
has need of my assistance.

44:28.544 --> 44:32.297
Yes. He said he wanted someone with--

44:32.381 --> 44:34.967
Someone who's actually had
their ass on the line?

44:37.302 --> 44:40.264
I believe that's how he put it, yes.

44:42.224 --> 44:46.019
Okay. Let's not belabor this any further.
What do we got?

44:46.103 --> 44:48.021
What are the propellant margins
he'll be dealing with

44:48.105 --> 44:50.148
once Kelly separates from the MSAM?

44:50.732 --> 44:54.528
He could have as little as
2% to 3% left in his tanks.

44:55.237 --> 44:56.697
That's not much to work with.

44:59.032 --> 45:00.826
FIDO, GUIDO teamsâ€¦

45:02.452 --> 45:05.539
get Ms. Cobb anything she needs.

45:32.691 --> 45:34.234
I'm glad you guys made it back.

45:35.569 --> 45:38.280
These are the residents of Happy Valley.

45:41.450 --> 45:42.451
Welcome.

45:45.954 --> 45:47.497
All right. What's his name?

45:47.581 --> 45:50.000
No idea. He won't say a word.

45:55.130 --> 45:56.632
What is your name?

46:00.886 --> 46:02.721
Lieutenant Colonel Lee Jung-Gil.

46:03.305 --> 46:04.723
What in the hell?

46:04.806 --> 46:07.059
I picked up a few words during the war.

46:08.936 --> 46:12.189
Commander Ed Baldwin.

46:13.440 --> 46:16.193
You must take me back to my post.

46:17.361 --> 46:18.570
Your post?

46:21.698 --> 46:24.451
You must take me back to my post.

46:24.535 --> 46:27.246
He keep-- keeps saying we should--

46:27.329 --> 46:29.164
we should take him back to his home.

46:29.248 --> 46:31.917
He didn't seem too happy
about us taking him from his ship,

46:32.000 --> 46:35.504
but what were we supposed to do,
just leave him there to die?

46:35.587 --> 46:39.633
To him, the mission is above all else,
no matter what cost.

46:42.177 --> 46:44.263
Well, my good dumplingâ€¦

46:44.847 --> 46:47.224
â€¦this is now your home.

46:50.686 --> 46:53.897
Okay. Dani. Get the Kurs system to Louisa.

46:53.981 --> 46:55.649
-Yeah.
-We need to launch soon.

47:00.904 --> 47:02.948
Okay.

47:31.226 --> 47:32.561
Jimmy.

47:34.021 --> 47:35.397
-Karen.
-Hi.

47:35.480 --> 47:36.732
Hi.

47:37.941 --> 47:39.943
What are you--

47:41.028 --> 47:43.447
Oh, yeah, you're here for theâ€¦

47:43.530 --> 47:46.158
Yes. I didn't expect to see you though.

47:46.742 --> 47:49.578
Yeah. Well, you know, I'm here.

47:51.580 --> 47:53.540
I'm sure that Danny appreciates that.

47:55.083 --> 47:56.084
Yeah.

47:58.795 --> 48:00.005
You good?

48:02.341 --> 48:04.009
Yeah, I--

48:04.885 --> 48:08.013
I just think I'm gonna go out for a smoke.

48:09.014 --> 48:11.183
Okay. Well, I'll see you in there then.

48:11.266 --> 48:12.851
Yeah. I'll see you in there.

48:12.935 --> 48:13.936
Okay.

48:38.168 --> 48:39.169
Karen.

48:47.344 --> 48:48.971
We've got a spot over here for you.

48:49.555 --> 48:50.556
Thanks.

48:53.100 --> 48:55.978
You know, I knew I'd get you
to work with me one way or another.

49:05.362 --> 49:07.197
It's funny, they used to keep me up there.

49:09.700 --> 49:10.701
Me too.

49:11.535 --> 49:14.830
Yeah, 20 years ago
I was in the viewing gallery

49:14.913 --> 49:19.001
waiting to hear
if my husband was gonna be okay.

49:20.794 --> 49:21.795
And now I'm down here.

49:22.546 --> 49:26.425
Still waiting to hear
if he and my daughter are gonna be okay.

49:44.651 --> 49:46.195
Hey, Jim.

49:48.322 --> 49:49.531
How'd it go?

49:50.949 --> 49:51.950
Good.

49:52.951 --> 49:55.329
Real good. Everything's set up.

49:55.412 --> 49:58.248
Great. We really appreciate it.

49:58.749 --> 50:00.626
-Don't we, Hal?
-Sure do.

50:03.128 --> 50:04.421
Cool.

50:06.548 --> 50:07.758
I gotta go to the restroom.

50:08.800 --> 50:11.386
All right. We'll see you in a little bit.

50:21.480 --> 50:23.690
Hi, it's Amber. Please leave a message.

50:24.733 --> 50:28.028
Amber, it's Jimmy. Please call me back.

50:28.111 --> 50:31.615
I think there's something going down
at JSC,

50:31.698 --> 50:34.701
and I don't know what to do.

50:36.078 --> 50:37.079
Maybe--

50:39.164 --> 50:40.582
Hey, you okay?

50:41.166 --> 50:43.001
Yeah. I'm fine.

50:43.085 --> 50:46.797
Cool. Yeah,
'cause you kinda ran off back there, soâ€¦

50:47.923 --> 50:52.094
No, I had to go pee. That's all.

50:53.262 --> 50:54.263
Who you calling?

50:55.180 --> 50:56.181
Amber.

50:57.808 --> 50:59.685
I was telling her
I was gonna be home late.

51:00.519 --> 51:01.645
That's so sweet.

51:05.065 --> 51:06.149
I'm gonna go pee.

51:10.320 --> 51:11.530
Ms. Madison?

51:13.156 --> 51:15.993
There's a video call for you
from Ramstein Air Force Base in Germany.

51:17.786 --> 51:18.787
Put it through.

51:33.427 --> 51:34.720
Margo?

51:37.097 --> 51:38.348
It is done.

51:39.433 --> 51:42.978
My family and I, we are out.
Thank you. Thank you so much.

51:44.897 --> 51:47.149
I'm so happy to hear that, Sergei.

51:47.232 --> 51:49.693
You know, it was quite exhilarating.

51:49.776 --> 51:51.403
They took us in the middle of the night.

51:51.486 --> 51:54.031
You know, we only landed here
in Germany one hour ago.

51:54.114 --> 51:56.533
I hope it wasn't too much
for your parents.

51:56.617 --> 51:58.493
No. On the contrary.

51:58.577 --> 52:01.622
No, they were never been more excited.

52:01.705 --> 52:03.248
First time in the helicopter.

52:08.754 --> 52:09.922
Thank you.

52:11.173 --> 52:12.591
Thank you once again, Margo.

52:12.674 --> 52:16.094
I don't know
if I can ever repay you for this.

52:16.178 --> 52:18.347
Don't worry about that. Just stay safe.

52:18.430 --> 52:22.726
They say we should be in
the United States by the end of the week.

52:24.353 --> 52:25.479
That'sâ€¦

52:28.190 --> 52:29.525
wonderful.

52:29.608 --> 52:32.736
I am very much
looking forward to living in America.

52:33.904 --> 52:37.282
It's gonna be an adjustment
living in a new place.

52:37.366 --> 52:38.367
Yes.

52:39.326 --> 52:41.328
I cannot wait.

52:43.080 --> 52:44.831
We will see each other very soon.

52:46.166 --> 52:48.252
Yes. We will.

52:50.045 --> 52:51.171
Goodbye, Sergei.

53:01.181 --> 53:05.644
So, Ed, the trick with this is
it's all in the timing.

53:05.727 --> 53:08.981
Now, don't try to judge your height
by looking down at the ground.

53:09.064 --> 53:11.275
It'll be coming towards you too fast.

53:11.358 --> 53:13.569
And you can't trust that radar altimeter,

53:13.652 --> 53:16.154
because we don't know exactly
what terrain you're gonna be dealing with.

53:16.238 --> 53:17.781
So that's fucking useless.

53:18.490 --> 53:21.785
You gotta keep your eye on the horizon

53:21.869 --> 53:25.789
to gauge exactly when to fire 'em up.

53:26.415 --> 53:29.668
A second too soon, you're a smoking hole,

53:29.751 --> 53:33.005
and a second too late,
you're a barbecue chicken.

53:35.299 --> 53:37.968
Yeah, it's a good thing
you're at the end of your career, Ed.

53:38.802 --> 53:40.721
You ain't got that much
to look forward to anyway.

53:42.347 --> 53:43.432
Godspeed, friend.

53:49.563 --> 53:50.564
Mol.

53:51.565 --> 53:53.025
Is this gonna work?

53:53.108 --> 53:58.155
I'm not gonna lie.
This is about as tricky as flying gets.

53:59.406 --> 54:01.074
Last time I tried anything like this

54:01.158 --> 54:04.494
was back in my barnstorming days
at the Topeka State Fair.

54:04.995 --> 54:08.373
You were a barnstormer.
Why does that not surprise me?

54:08.457 --> 54:13.086
Oh, yeah. Clown suit,
flying on the wings, the works.

54:13.587 --> 54:17.341
Only way I could make a living
after these fuckers killed Mercury 13.

54:17.925 --> 54:19.635
They can't keep you away, can they?

54:21.178 --> 54:22.221
Not a chance.

54:26.517 --> 54:27.518
Excuse me.

54:33.524 --> 54:35.442
-Amber?
-Hi. Karen,

54:35.526 --> 54:40.447
I'm sorry to bother you, especially
now, but I didn't know who else to call.

54:40.531 --> 54:42.074
-What's wrong?
-It's Jimmy.

54:42.699 --> 54:44.409
I got a message from him
a few minutes ago,

54:44.493 --> 54:45.911
and he was speaking really fast

54:45.994 --> 54:48.622
and talking about
something weird going on at JSC,

54:48.705 --> 54:50.123
and then his phone just cut out.

54:50.207 --> 54:53.126
I'm really worried about him.
He hasn't been himself lately.

54:54.336 --> 54:55.337
Okay.

54:57.965 --> 54:59.716
Let me see what I can figure out, okay?

54:59.800 --> 55:00.968
Thank you, Karen.

55:42.551 --> 55:44.011
Everything out there prepped for launch?

55:45.888 --> 55:47.139
-Yeah.
-Great.

55:48.265 --> 55:50.142
-Ed.
-Yeah?

55:53.729 --> 55:55.022
Please let me do this.

55:56.690 --> 56:00.068
I've been training on the MSAM since '92.
I know it.

56:03.322 --> 56:05.199
-She's my daughter.
-I know.

56:06.283 --> 56:07.784
But the odds of you making it backâ€¦

56:14.458 --> 56:15.959
I'm the one that should go.

56:16.877 --> 56:18.253
If anyone's gonna do itâ€¦

56:20.214 --> 56:22.549
-it should be me.
-What the hell are you talking about?

56:23.133 --> 56:26.595
You got a wife and kid back home.
You got your whole life in front of you.

56:26.678 --> 56:28.013
End of discussion.

56:29.598 --> 56:30.599
Butâ€¦

56:31.099 --> 56:33.477
-I really don't have time to argue--
-It was me, Ed.

56:40.108 --> 56:42.277
You what?
What the hell are you talking about?

56:47.407 --> 56:50.244
I'm the one who didn't relieve
the housing pressure on the drill.

56:53.205 --> 56:54.456
Not Nick.

56:54.540 --> 56:55.541
What?

56:59.586 --> 57:01.171
It's my fault the drill came apart.

57:05.259 --> 57:08.053
-No, that's not possible.
-It's true, Ed.

57:08.136 --> 57:12.933
You got distracted. It was a mistake.

57:13.016 --> 57:14.017
No.

57:16.603 --> 57:19.690
I saw the numbers rising.
I didn't do anything to stop it.

57:24.236 --> 57:25.237
Why?

57:28.699 --> 57:29.700
I--

57:30.659 --> 57:33.412
I just turned the comm off.

57:33.495 --> 57:35.038
I don't know. I was angry.

57:35.122 --> 57:37.666
I was a mess.

57:41.044 --> 57:42.212
Ed, I'm sorry.

57:45.591 --> 57:46.717
I'm sorry.

57:49.887 --> 57:53.056
Ed, please. I have to do this.

57:53.140 --> 57:55.350
-I have to do this, please, Ed.
-No.

57:55.434 --> 57:58.145
-Please, let me do this. Ed, please.
-No!

57:59.730 --> 58:02.608
After what you just said, you think I'm
gonna let you fly my daughter up there?

58:02.691 --> 58:04.943
-I just-- I thought--
-You thought?

58:05.027 --> 58:07.279
You didn't think at all,
you selfish piece of shit.

58:07.362 --> 58:08.572
Ed, I'm sorry.

58:08.655 --> 58:12.159
My daughter's not the way you absolve
yourself from your fucking guilt.

58:12.659 --> 58:15.954
I'm gonna tell you what you're gonna do.
You're gonna get your ass back to work,

58:16.038 --> 58:19.041
and you're gonna make sure
that everything goes according to plan.

58:20.375 --> 58:22.127
And when all this is overâ€¦

58:24.171 --> 58:26.256
there's gonna be a reckoning, Danny.

58:27.341 --> 58:28.717
You understand?

58:32.846 --> 58:34.890
I can't fucking hear you.

58:36.225 --> 58:37.476
Aye, aye, sir.

58:41.897 --> 58:43.232
Get outta here.

59:16.974 --> 59:17.975
Excuse me, sir.

59:18.058 --> 59:23.230
Have you seen a young man, kinda
longish hair, flannel shirt, denim coat?

59:23.313 --> 59:25.816
-No, ma'am.
-No? Okay. Thanks.

59:28.652 --> 59:29.653
Shit.

59:44.835 --> 59:46.128
Hey, this is Jimmy.

59:46.211 --> 59:47.212
Leave a message.

1:00:03.979 --> 1:00:06.982
Good. Transmit this
up to Happy Valley base.

1:00:07.065 --> 1:00:09.318
Make sure they use
this updated launch window.

1:00:12.696 --> 1:00:13.697
Listen up.

1:00:26.668 --> 1:00:32.007
I remember standing right over there when
Gene Kranz put a hold on the countdown

1:00:32.090 --> 1:00:35.677
and called everyone in here
before Apollo 11.

1:00:35.761 --> 1:00:38.347
Yeah, I'm old.

1:00:42.142 --> 1:00:45.354
I still remember his words to this day.

1:00:47.105 --> 1:00:52.569
"The future is ours to fight for and win."

1:00:55.155 --> 1:00:56.198
He was right then.

1:00:58.367 --> 1:01:00.202
And he still is today.

1:01:10.170 --> 1:01:12.172
So I just wanted to say

1:01:13.423 --> 1:01:14.550
what an honor

1:01:16.301 --> 1:01:17.594
and a privilege

1:01:18.762 --> 1:01:20.597
it has been working with all of you.

1:01:23.016 --> 1:01:24.101
Thank you.

1:01:40.158 --> 1:01:41.159
Aleida.

1:01:44.246 --> 1:01:45.455
The room is yours.

1:01:51.587 --> 1:01:52.838
All right, everyone.

1:01:53.839 --> 1:01:54.965
It's go time.

1:01:57.134 --> 1:01:59.928
We only got a few minutes
before the communications lag

1:02:00.012 --> 1:02:01.847
will prevent us from sending
anything else up,

1:02:01.930 --> 1:02:04.892
so let's make sure they have
up-to-date trajectories

1:02:04.975 --> 1:02:08.103
and that the flight crew on Phoenix
has eyes on the launch site.

1:03:11.834 --> 1:03:15.921
Alexei, he would have wanted this.

1:03:17.881 --> 1:03:18.882
I miss him.

1:03:20.050 --> 1:03:21.051
Me too.

1:03:24.054 --> 1:03:25.681
He would be very proud.

1:03:45.284 --> 1:03:46.743
Sixty seconds to launch.

1:03:47.619 --> 1:03:49.079
Doing okay up there, kid?

1:03:49.913 --> 1:03:54.459
You know.
Just thinking about my career choices.

1:03:55.586 --> 1:03:57.045
You got this, Kel.

1:03:57.129 --> 1:03:59.339
Happy Valley, Phoenix.

1:03:59.423 --> 1:04:01.133
All systems nominal.

1:04:02.759 --> 1:04:07.598
Our orbital plane alignment looks good.
And the flight trajectory is on target.

1:04:07.681 --> 1:04:09.641
Go for rendezvous.

1:04:09.725 --> 1:04:10.934
Copy, Phoenix.

1:04:11.018 --> 1:04:13.687
All systems are a go on our end.

1:04:13.770 --> 1:04:15.272
Popeyeâ€¦

1:04:17.858 --> 1:04:19.735
You are go for launch.

1:04:19.818 --> 1:04:24.489
Copy that. Booster arm on.
Tanks are pressurized.

1:04:25.782 --> 1:04:27.492
-Dad.
-Yeah?

1:04:28.619 --> 1:04:29.620
I love you.

1:04:31.371 --> 1:04:33.123
I love you too, kiddo.

1:04:33.207 --> 1:04:34.833
Always.

1:04:34.917 --> 1:04:36.168
Always.

1:04:39.922 --> 1:04:45.677
Ignition in five, four, three, two, one.

1:04:55.479 --> 1:04:56.897
Shit.

1:05:00.400 --> 1:05:04.154
Trajectory's right on target.
Velocity 122 meters per second.

1:05:13.038 --> 1:05:15.249
We'll smooth out in a minute, Kel.

1:05:18.585 --> 1:05:19.837
Low fuel.

1:05:19.920 --> 1:05:21.505
Fuel is at 30%.

1:05:22.089 --> 1:05:24.716
Velocity of 2,500 meters per second.

1:05:24.800 --> 1:05:26.260
One minute to separation.

1:05:26.343 --> 1:05:28.846
-Low fuel.
-Come on.

1:05:45.946 --> 1:05:49.032
-Kel, prepare for separation.
-Copy.

1:05:49.616 --> 1:05:51.702
Propeller tank pressure two on.

1:05:53.453 --> 1:05:55.539
I've got visual on Phoenix.

1:05:55.622 --> 1:05:56.707
Go for separation.

1:05:57.833 --> 1:05:59.126
Here we go, kid.

1:05:59.877 --> 1:06:01.879
Executing pitch maneuver.

1:06:01.962 --> 1:06:03.130
Engine shutdown.

1:06:03.839 --> 1:06:05.591
Unhooking safety harness.

1:06:05.674 --> 1:06:10.053
Fire PMU boosters in three, two, one. Go!

1:06:40.834 --> 1:06:43.629
-We got her.
-Yes!

1:06:43.712 --> 1:06:45.339
She's at the air lock.

1:06:45.839 --> 1:06:47.341
Nailed it.

1:07:36.098 --> 1:07:39.059
Jimmy.

1:07:39.142 --> 1:07:40.310
-Thank God, Karen.
-Okay.

1:07:40.394 --> 1:07:41.687
-We gotta get out of here.
-Oh, my God.

1:07:43.647 --> 1:07:45.399
Come on.

1:07:51.989 --> 1:07:52.948
Oh, my God.

1:08:00.831 --> 1:08:02.249
Run!

1:08:05.460 --> 1:08:06.461
Oh, shit.

1:08:07.921 --> 1:08:09.298
Move!

1:08:11.133 --> 1:08:12.134
Security!

1:08:14.011 --> 1:08:15.345
Security. Hi.

1:08:15.429 --> 1:08:18.765
There's a gray van over there,
and there's a man at the van.

1:08:22.102 --> 1:08:25.564
Get back! Everyone get back!

1:08:31.278 --> 1:08:33.197
Descent rate high.

1:08:33.947 --> 1:08:35.573
14,000 meters.

1:08:36.992 --> 1:08:40.495
Descent rate high.

1:08:42.038 --> 1:08:45.501
10,000 meters. Descent rate high.

1:08:49.587 --> 1:08:51.256
8,000 meters.

1:08:52.883 --> 1:08:55.093
Descent rate excessive.

1:08:57.638 --> 1:09:00.933
Descent rate excessive. 3,000 meters.

1:09:01.015 --> 1:09:02.643
Descent rate excessive.

1:09:04.728 --> 1:09:06.354
Descent rate excessive.

1:09:06.438 --> 1:09:08.189
1,000 meters. Pull up.

1:09:10.317 --> 1:09:12.402
Pull up. Descent rate excessive.

1:09:12.486 --> 1:09:14.363
500 meters. Pull up.

1:09:16.031 --> 1:09:18.951
Pull up.

1:09:42.015 --> 1:09:43.850
There are reports coming in

1:09:43.934 --> 1:09:46.770
of a bombing
at the Johnson Space Center in Houston.

1:09:46.854 --> 1:09:49.773
Looks like this could be
a mass-casualty eventâ€¦

1:09:49.857 --> 1:09:52.276
The number of casualties
is unknown at this time.

1:09:52.359 --> 1:09:53.986
We are hearing reports of potentiallyâ€¦

1:09:54.069 --> 1:09:56.572
A massive car bomb
has reportedly exploded

1:09:56.655 --> 1:09:59.116
outside the main office building
at Johnson Space Center.

1:09:59.199 --> 1:10:01.869
It is unknown how many have perished
at this time.

1:11:45.222 --> 1:11:46.932
Who's there? Who's that?

1:11:47.015 --> 1:11:48.267
It's Andrew.

1:11:49.059 --> 1:11:52.062
-Are you hurt?
-Yeah. It's my head.

1:11:52.145 --> 1:11:54.815
-Can you stand?
-I think so.

1:11:54.898 --> 1:11:56.733
Okay. I'm gonna get you out of here.

1:11:56.817 --> 1:11:58.735
Let's go, up.

1:12:47.159 --> 1:12:49.745
This way. Follow my voice.

1:12:49.828 --> 1:12:52.873
It's 25 more steps to the stairwell.

1:12:53.874 --> 1:12:56.960
All right, Andrew, we got this. Not far.

1:12:58.754 --> 1:13:01.757
Okay, here's the stairwell. Head down.

1:13:01.840 --> 1:13:04.426
Make your way to the front
of the building. Someone help him down.

1:13:04.510 --> 1:13:06.762
I'm going back for more people.

1:16:06.567 --> 1:16:07.568
Ed.

1:16:13.824 --> 1:16:16.952
There was a bombing at JSC.

1:16:19.413 --> 1:16:20.956
And Karen was there.

1:16:24.418 --> 1:16:25.752
I am so sorry.

1:17:34.404 --> 1:17:37.241
It's what we all decided
was for the best, Danny.

1:17:37.324 --> 1:17:40.160
Somebody will bring you
more supplies every month.

1:17:41.703 --> 1:17:43.247
I understand.

1:18:13.735 --> 1:18:15.988
In 1620, a ship called the Mayflower

1:18:16.071 --> 1:18:19.283
traveled across the Atlantic Ocean
in search of a new world.

1:18:20.909 --> 1:18:23.245
Some came to escape their past,

1:18:24.663 --> 1:18:26.665
others to follow their dreams.

1:18:38.260 --> 1:18:41.263
They faced many hardships and turmoil.

1:18:44.808 --> 1:18:46.226
But together,

1:18:46.310 --> 1:18:49.021
and with the memory
of those they left behindâ€¦

1:18:54.067 --> 1:18:55.694
they were able to overcome.

1:19:04.411 --> 1:19:07.831
What was once a group of strangers,

1:19:07.915 --> 1:19:09.750
voyagers seeking a better life,

1:19:11.084 --> 1:19:13.212
had become something different,

1:19:14.463 --> 1:19:15.464
something more.

1:19:20.552 --> 1:19:22.846
And in the unlikeliest of placesâ€¦

1:19:24.973 --> 1:19:26.892
they found a new home.

1:19:50.165 --> 1:19:51.208
Hey.

1:19:54.127 --> 1:19:55.128
Hey.

1:20:00.509 --> 1:20:01.510
Soâ€¦

1:20:03.762 --> 1:20:04.972
what do we do now?

1:20:10.727 --> 1:20:11.770
I don't know.

1:20:39.214 --> 1:20:40.215
Mornin'.
