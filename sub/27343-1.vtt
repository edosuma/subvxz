I'm really sick.

1:03:20.393 --> 1:03:23.318
- Well you know me,
I'm really sick.

1:03:23.318 --> 1:03:23.356
- Well you know me,
I'm really sick.
And no-one's told
me, but we just know

1:03:23.356 --> 1:03:25.801
And no-one's told
me, but we just know

1:03:25.801 --> 1:03:25.840
And no-one's told
me, but we just know
that there are no
ghosts that affect us

1:03:25.840 --> 1:03:28.443
that there are no
ghosts that affect us

1:03:28.443 --> 1:03:28.481
that there are no
ghosts that affect us
with the way we live, 'cause
as humans we differ from that.

1:03:28.481 --> 1:03:31.806
with the way we live, 'cause
as humans we differ from that.

1:03:31.806 --> 1:03:31.845
with the way we live, 'cause
as humans we differ from that.
We can make our own decisions

1:03:31.845 --> 1:03:33.008
We can make our own decisions

1:03:33.008 --> 1:03:33.046
We can make our own decisions
and affect the way
we live ourselves,

1:03:33.046 --> 1:03:34.890
and affect the way
we live ourselves,

1:03:34.890 --> 1:03:34.928
and affect the way
we live ourselves,
in our own ways of doing it.

1:03:34.928 --> 1:03:37.333
in our own ways of doing it.

1:03:37.333 --> 1:03:37.371
in our own ways of doing it.
- You know Mary, I think
that's really, really pathetic.

1:03:37.371 --> 1:03:42.218
- You know Mary, I think
that's really, really pathetic.

1:03:42.218 --> 1:03:42.256
- You know Mary, I think
that's really, really pathetic.
(Julia and Josh laughing)

1:03:42.256 --> 1:03:43.498
(Julia and Josh laughing)

1:03:43.498 --> 1:03:43.536
(Julia and Josh laughing)
- No, seriously, no,
honestly, come on now.

1:03:43.536 --> 1:03:46.221
- No, seriously, no,
honestly, come on now.

1:03:46.221 --> 1:03:46.260
- No, seriously, no,
honestly, come on now.
There's no scientific proof
to prove anything that exists

1:03:46.260 --> 1:03:48.985
There's no scientific proof
to prove anything that exists

1:03:48.985 --> 1:03:49.023
There's no scientific proof
to prove anything that exists
from the beyond, and if
there are photos and videos,

1:03:49.023 --> 1:03:51.946
from the beyond, and if
there are photos and videos,

1:03:51.946 --> 1:03:51.985
from the beyond, and if
there are photos and videos,
they can be almost
proved 100% wrong.

1:03:51.985 --> 1:03:54.910
they can be almost
proved 100% wrong.

1:03:54.910 --> 1:03:54.948
they can be almost
proved 100% wrong.
- Exactly, key word, almost.

1:03:54.948 --> 1:03:57.633
- Exactly, key word, almost.

1:03:57.633 --> 1:03:57.671
- Exactly, key word, almost.
- Exactly.

1:03:57.671 --> 1:03:58.995
- Exactly.

1:03:58.995 --> 1:03:59.033
- Exactly.
- You know exactly what
I'm trying to say here.

1:03:59.033 --> 1:04:00.756
- You know exactly what
I'm trying to say here.

1:04:00.756 --> 1:04:00.795
- You know exactly what
I'm trying to say here.
And there might be
some unknown cases,

1:04:00.795 --> 1:04:02.958
And there might be
some unknown cases,

1:04:02.958 --> 1:04:02.996
And there might be
some unknown cases,
but no.
- Well what if it's exactly

1:04:02.996 --> 1:04:06.081
but no.
- Well what if it's exactly

1:04:06.081 --> 1:04:06.120
but no.
- Well what if it's exactly
those unknown cases that
explain the whole thing?

1:04:06.120 --> 1:04:09.445
those unknown cases that
explain the whole thing?

1:04:09.445 --> 1:04:09.483
those unknown cases that
explain the whole thing?
I mean, who knows?
- Who knows?

1:04:09.483 --> 1:04:11.046
I mean, who knows?
- Who knows?

1:04:11.046 --> 1:04:11.085
I mean, who knows?
- Who knows?
- Yeah, who knows?
- Uh, physicists?

1:04:11.085 --> 1:04:13.408
- Yeah, who knows?
- Uh, physicists?

1:04:13.408 --> 1:04:13.446
- Yeah, who knows?
- Uh, physicists?
Chemists, biologists?

1:04:13.446 --> 1:04:15.370
Chemists, biologists?

1:04:15.370 --> 1:04:15.408
Chemists, biologists?
- What about parapsychologists?

1:04:15.408 --> 1:04:17.091
- What about parapsychologists?

1:04:17.091 --> 1:04:17.130
- What about parapsychologists?
- Thank you!
- Oh please, I beg you.

1:04:17.130 --> 1:04:19.415
- Thank you!
- Oh please, I beg you.

1:04:19.415 --> 1:04:19.453
- Thank you!
- Oh please, I beg you.
- No seriously, just try

1:04:19.453 --> 1:04:21.456
- No seriously, just try

1:04:21.456 --> 1:04:21.495
- No seriously, just try
and be a bit more open
minded about this.

1:04:21.495 --> 1:04:23.498
and be a bit more open
minded about this.

1:04:23.498 --> 1:04:23.536
and be a bit more open
minded about this.
- Okay, I will try and be a
bit more open minded about this

1:04:23.536 --> 1:04:26.421
- Okay, I will try and be a
bit more open minded about this

1:04:26.421 --> 1:04:26.460
- Okay, I will try and be a
bit more open minded about this
and say that, from now on,
I'll believe that ghosts exist.

1:04:26.460 --> 1:04:30.185
and say that, from now on,
I'll believe that ghosts exist.

1:04:30.185 --> 1:04:30.223
and say that, from now on,
I'll believe that ghosts exist.
- Thank you.
- Yes, because they do exist.

1:04:30.223 --> 1:04:32.508
- Thank you.
- Yes, because they do exist.

1:04:32.508 --> 1:04:32.546
- Thank you.
- Yes, because they do exist.
- Oh please, not
you as well, Julia.

1:04:32.546 --> 1:04:34.750
- Oh please, not
you as well, Julia.

1:04:34.750 --> 1:04:34.788
- Oh please, not
you as well, Julia.
- Oh come on, Mary, you
promised to be more open, right?

1:04:34.788 --> 1:04:37.233
- Oh come on, Mary, you
promised to be more open, right?

1:04:37.233 --> 1:04:37.271
- Oh come on, Mary, you
promised to be more open, right?
- Right.
- Okay, so now listen.

1:04:37.271 --> 1:04:39.195
- Right.
- Okay, so now listen.

1:04:39.195 --> 1:04:39.233
- Right.
- Okay, so now listen.
- Okay, I'm listening.

1:04:39.233 --> 1:04:40.996
- Okay, I'm listening.

1:04:42.678 --> 1:04:45.921
- When I was about
eight or nine years old,

1:04:45.921 --> 1:04:45.960
- When I was about
eight or nine years old,
we moved into this new house.

1:04:45.960 --> 1:04:48.403
we moved into this new house.

1:04:48.403 --> 1:04:48.441
we moved into this new house.
I started having
trouble falling asleep

1:04:48.441 --> 1:04:51.086
I started having
trouble falling asleep

1:04:51.086 --> 1:04:51.125
I started having
trouble falling asleep
but I don't even know why.

1:04:51.125 --> 1:04:53.288
but I don't even know why.

1:04:54.410 --> 1:04:57.933
But night after
night I would wake up

1:04:57.933 --> 1:04:57.971
But night after
night I would wake up
soaked in sweat,
crying for my mom.

1:04:57.971 --> 1:05:00.976
soaked in sweat,
crying for my mom.

1:05:02.938 --> 1:05:04.220
She would come and comfort me

1:05:04.220 --> 1:05:04.258
She would come and comfort me
and tell me that I'd
just had a bad dream.

1:05:04.258 --> 1:05:07.463
and tell me that I'd
just had a bad dream.

1:05:07.463 --> 1:05:07.501
and tell me that I'd
just had a bad dream.
- That could've
been from stress.

1:05:07.501 --> 1:05:09.625
- That could've
been from stress.

1:05:09.625 --> 1:05:09.663
- That could've
been from stress.
You moved to a new house,
that obviously disturbed

1:05:09.663 --> 1:05:11.986
You moved to a new house,
that obviously disturbed

1:05:11.986 --> 1:05:12.025
You moved to a new house,
that obviously disturbed
the way you were feeling.

1:05:12.025 --> 1:05:13.068
the way you were feeling.

1:05:13.068 --> 1:05:13.106
the way you were feeling.
- That was not it, all right?

1:05:13.106 --> 1:05:15.510
- That was not it, all right?

1:05:15.510 --> 1:05:15.550
- That was not it, all right?
I loved the house, I
had this big garden,

1:05:15.550 --> 1:05:18.713
I loved the house, I
had this big garden,

1:05:18.713 --> 1:05:18.751
I loved the house, I
had this big garden,
so much room to play, my parents
were happy, we were happy.

1:05:18.751 --> 1:05:23.638
so much room to play, my parents
were happy, we were happy.

1:05:24.920 --> 1:05:30.005
Still, night after night I would
be having those nightmares.

1:05:33.688 --> 1:05:36.651
So after three or four
weeks, my mom promised

1:05:36.651 --> 1:05:36.690
So after three or four
weeks, my mom promised
that she would stay up until
I'd fallen asleep, in my room.

1:05:36.690 --> 1:05:41.576
that she would stay up until
I'd fallen asleep, in my room.

1:05:44.940 --> 1:05:49.065
Guess she couldn't bear
my crying any longer.

1:05:49.065 --> 1:05:49.103
Guess she couldn't bear
my crying any longer.
It was probably also a
way to comfort herself.

1:05:49.103 --> 1:05:53.428
It was probably also a
way to comfort herself.

1:05:53.428 --> 1:05:53.466
It was probably also a
way to comfort herself.
- You know what, sounds
like a great mom.

1:05:53.466 --> 1:05:56.231
- You know what, sounds
like a great mom.

1:05:56.231 --> 1:05:56.270
- You know what, sounds
like a great mom.
- Yeah, she is, and it worked.

1:05:56.270 --> 1:05:58.833
- Yeah, she is, and it worked.

1:06:04.320 --> 1:06:08.923
Last thing I remember was
her kind face smiling at me.

1:06:11.126 --> 1:06:12.608
And then I woke up.

1:06:15.971 --> 1:06:19.975
I saw my mom sitting in
the corner, staring at me,

1:06:21.456 --> 1:06:23.458
and her face was frozen.

1:06:26.141 --> 1:06:29.985
Then I noticed that she
wasn't looking at me.

1:06:29.985 --> 1:06:30.023
Then I noticed that she
wasn't looking at me.
But right above me.

1:06:30.023 --> 1:06:31.466
But right above me.

1:06:33.028 --> 1:06:34.550
So I turned around.

1:06:36.911 --> 1:06:39.515
And I looked at this black face,

1:06:40.676 --> 1:06:43.278
with like white
fangs and red eyes.

1:06:47.281 --> 1:06:51.046
It was bending over me
and pulling my hair.

1:06:51.046 --> 1:06:51.085
It was bending over me
and pulling my hair.
I started screaming,
so the lights went on

1:06:51.085 --> 1:06:54.210
I started screaming,
so the lights went on

1:06:54.210 --> 1:06:54.248
I started screaming,
so the lights went on
and my dad came in and
pulled me out of the bed,

1:06:54.248 --> 1:06:57.453
and my dad came in and
pulled me out of the bed,

1:06:57.453 --> 1:06:57.491
and my dad came in and
pulled me out of the bed,
and I did a lot of
crying that night.

1:06:57.491 --> 1:07:00.535
and I did a lot of
crying that night.

1:07:06.701 --> 1:07:11.186
Shortly after that I
fell asleep in the car,

1:07:11.186 --> 1:07:11.225
Shortly after that I
fell asleep in the car,
and we never went back
to that house again.

1:07:11.225 --> 1:07:14.710
and we never went back
to that house again.

1:07:18.753 --> 1:07:22.076
Pretty soon after
that, we moved.

1:07:22.076 --> 1:07:22.115
Pretty soon after
that, we moved.
My parents told me that the
house had gotten too expensive

1:07:22.115 --> 1:07:25.200
My parents told me that the
house had gotten too expensive

1:07:25.200 --> 1:07:25.238
My parents told me that the
house had gotten too expensive
and we would have to
look for a new one,

1:07:25.238 --> 1:07:28.083
and we would have to
look for a new one,

1:07:28.083 --> 1:07:28.121
and we would have to
look for a new one,
blah, blah, blah. (laughing)

1:07:28.121 --> 1:07:29.925
blah, blah, blah. (laughing)

1:07:29.925 --> 1:07:29.963
blah, blah, blah. (laughing)
I didn't ask any questions.

1:07:29.963 --> 1:07:32.206
I didn't ask any questions.

1:07:34.650 --> 1:07:38.133
But every time I looked
into my mom's eyes,

1:07:41.456 --> 1:07:46.381
I was reminded of that shocked
look on her face that night.

1:07:51.746 --> 1:07:53.468
- That's really deep.

1:07:54.630 --> 1:07:57.231
- Yeah, you're sure, you know,

1:07:59.715 --> 1:08:02.598
it wasn't just a
delusion or something?

1:08:02.598 --> 1:08:02.636
it wasn't just a
delusion or something?
- No, I wasn't delusional,
it was real, and it still is.

1:08:02.636 --> 1:08:07.201
- No, I wasn't delusional,
it was real, and it still is.

1:08:09.765 --> 1:08:12.968
Even though the memory
may be slowly fading,

1:08:12.968 --> 1:08:13.006
Even though the memory
may be slowly fading,
but that doesn't
change anything.

1:08:13.006 --> 1:08:15.650
but that doesn't
change anything.

1:08:17.171 --> 1:08:20.135
- I personally think
that might've just been

1:08:20.135 --> 1:08:20.173
- I personally think
that might've just been
a case of sleep paralysis,
most kids tend to get that

1:08:20.173 --> 1:08:24.140
a case of sleep paralysis,
most kids tend to get that

1:08:24.140 --> 1:08:24.178
a case of sleep paralysis,
most kids tend to get that
when their brains are still
developing at a young age.

1:08:24.178 --> 1:08:26.821
when their brains are still
developing at a young age.

1:08:26.821 --> 1:08:26.860
when their brains are still
developing at a young age.
They're still fast asleep
in a deep REM sleep,

1:08:26.860 --> 1:08:30.265
They're still fast asleep
in a deep REM sleep,

1:08:30.265 --> 1:08:30.303
They're still fast asleep
in a deep REM sleep,
but they believe
that they're awake,

1:08:30.303 --> 1:08:31.346
but they believe
that they're awake,

1:08:31.346 --> 1:08:31.385
but they believe
that they're awake,
so it's as if they're
paralyzed, you know?

1:08:31.385 --> 1:08:33.188
so it's as if they're
paralyzed, you know?

1:08:33.188 --> 1:08:33.226
so it's as if they're
paralyzed, you know?
And your dreams could've
become mixed with reality

1:08:33.226 --> 1:08:37.231
And your dreams could've
become mixed with reality

1:08:37.231 --> 1:08:37.270
And your dreams could've
become mixed with reality
and reality could've
become blurred.

1:08:37.270 --> 1:08:39.475
and reality could've
become blurred.

1:08:39.475 --> 1:08:39.513
and reality could've
become blurred.
- It was not sleep
paralysis, all right Mary?

1:08:39.513 --> 1:08:42.718
- It was not sleep
paralysis, all right Mary?

1:08:42.718 --> 1:08:42.756
- It was not sleep
paralysis, all right Mary?
- I dunno, everything can
be scientifically explained.

1:08:42.756 --> 1:08:45.600
- I dunno, everything can
be scientifically explained.

1:08:45.600 --> 1:08:45.638
- I dunno, everything can
be scientifically explained.
It just, to us it sounds like
vanities of a young child.

1:08:45.638 --> 1:08:48.763
It just, to us it sounds like
vanities of a young child.

1:08:48.763 --> 1:08:48.801
It just, to us it sounds like
vanities of a young child.
- You know what?

1:08:48.801 --> 1:08:50.245
- You know what?

1:08:50.245 --> 1:08:50.283
- You know what?
Seriously, I know
what happened, okay?

1:08:50.283 --> 1:08:52.848
Seriously, I know
what happened, okay?

1:08:52.848 --> 1:08:52.886
Seriously, I know
what happened, okay?
And if you don't wanna
understand, fine.

1:08:52.886 --> 1:08:55.730
And if you don't wanna
understand, fine.

1:08:55.730 --> 1:08:55.770
And if you don't wanna
understand, fine.
Just forget about it.

1:08:55.770 --> 1:08:57.411
Just forget about it.

1:08:58.573 --> 1:09:00.295
- [Josh] Oh my god.

1:09:01.536 --> 1:09:06.301
- It's all right, it's
fine, I'll take care of her.

1:09:06.301 --> 1:09:06.340
- It's all right, it's
fine, I'll take care of her.
Don't do anything you couldn't
scientifically explain.

1:09:06.340 --> 1:09:09.545
Don't do anything you couldn't
scientifically explain.

1:09:09.545 --> 1:09:09.583
Don't do anything you couldn't
scientifically explain.
- That was kind of fucked up.

1:09:09.583 --> 1:09:12.226
