00:02.919 --> 00:06.047
-All right. Step aside. Homicide.
-How long you been waiting to say that?

00:06.131 --> 00:07.924
It’s the first thing I thought of
when I opened my eyes.

00:08.008 --> 00:09.009
Hey, Sarge.

00:09.884 --> 00:10.927
-Here.
-What’s this?

00:11.219 --> 00:12.303
Open it.

00:14.597 --> 00:17.934
"Scofield Realty. Greg Medavoy, sales."

00:18.309 --> 00:21.229
-When you’re ready.
-I think I’m gonna put in my papers.

00:21.855 --> 00:22.856
Are you serious?

00:23.023 --> 00:25.692
I don’t think I’ll love a job
as much as being a detective,

00:26.026 --> 00:27.736
but I got an opportunity opening up.

00:29.529 --> 00:31.197
I think I could have a life with Brigid,

00:31.406 --> 00:33.491
and I’m never gonna have
another chance like that.

00:45.962 --> 00:47.839
ANDY: Two of mine, Donatelli and Perez.

00:47.964 --> 00:50.383
Chasing a suspicious male
who throws a shot.

00:50.508 --> 00:52.427
-Gets Donatelli in the leg.
-RITA: He get away?

00:53.303 --> 00:55.472
The back of the building
opens up onto Attorney Street.

00:55.638 --> 00:56.890
Chances are, he came out there.

00:57.140 --> 00:58.933
-He all right for us to talk to him?
-Yeah, go ahead.

01:00.852 --> 01:03.146
-Hey, how you doing?
-All right.

01:03.813 --> 01:06.357
-Did you get a look at him?
-Male, Black, 18 to 20.

01:06.608 --> 01:08.693
He had some gray hooded sweatshirt
underneath an army jacket.

01:08.902 --> 01:09.944
A knit hat.

01:10.111 --> 01:12.864
-Height, weight?
-On the short side, probably 5’5", 5’6".

01:13.073 --> 01:14.240
Uh, thin build.

01:14.491 --> 01:15.700
RITA: What happened before you took
off after him?

01:16.242 --> 01:17.285
We see him walking down the street.

01:17.494 --> 01:19.913
At first, I thought I recognized him
from having locked him up.

01:20.330 --> 01:23.708
It looks like there’s a bulge on his hip.
I tell him to come over. He takes off.

01:23.958 --> 01:25.376
-Into there?
-Right there.

01:25.668 --> 01:26.836
At first didn’t see him,

01:26.920 --> 01:28.171
and then he jumps out
from around the corner,

01:28.671 --> 01:29.881
threw a shot, and took off.

01:30.340 --> 01:31.800
-Did you guys get any shots off?
-No.

01:32.050 --> 01:33.426
Look guys, we got to get going.

01:33.885 --> 01:36.221
I’d like to ride with him in the ambulance
unless you need me to stay here.

01:36.387 --> 01:38.348
That's all right,
we’ll find you down at the hospital.

01:39.140 --> 01:41.810
ANDY: Hey! Hey!
what are you doing, huh?

01:41.976 --> 01:45.230
You see you’re blocking an ambulance here?
Get this car the hell out of here!

Sergeant Sipowicz.

01:57.033 --> 02:00.203
ANDY: I saw that directly across
from where Donatelli got shot,

02:00.370 --> 02:05.375
there was a woman sitting in the window.
Name’s Margaret Gregorac, apartment 1-B.

02:05.917 --> 02:07.168
She was there at the time,

02:07.293 --> 02:09.796
saw Donatelli and Perez
go into the building. Heard the shot.

02:09.963 --> 02:11.005
You might want to talk to her.

02:11.381 --> 02:13.758
-Sounds like you already did.
-It’s your case.

02:14.467 --> 02:17.303
We had a report
of a homicide, 515 Bank Street.

02:17.554 --> 02:19.180
Clark and Jones, you guys take it.

02:22.267 --> 02:23.977
-Hey, Andy.
-ANDY: Yeah.

02:26.271 --> 02:27.647
-Hey, Andy.
-Hey.

02:29.524 --> 02:31.442
Andy, let me get one
of you up in the squad.

02:31.609 --> 02:33.361

don’t take my picture.

-It’s my last day.
-(SIGHS)

02:36.030 --> 02:37.574
I know it’s your last day. I, uh...

02:38.116 --> 02:39.868
I just don’t feel like
having my picture taken.

-Name’s Deborah Olshan, 37 years old.

04:02.992 --> 04:04.953
Looks like she got hit
in the head with that statue.

04:06.412 --> 04:09.749
-Who called in the job?
-A friend of hers, Maxine Anunziato.

04:09.916 --> 04:11.876
Let herself in
with her own key around 9:00.

got her rings.

I’m Detective Clark.
This is Detective Jones.

04:38.820 --> 04:39.862
You found her?

04:41.906 --> 04:45.952
She was getting ready to redo her kitchen.
We were supposed to go to ABC Carpet

04:46.119 --> 04:47.161
to pick out some tile.

04:48.121 --> 04:49.163
How’d you get in?

I had a key
from when I house-sat for them.

-Debbie and her husband.

-Barry Olshan.

04:56.462 --> 04:57.463
How did you know Debbie?

04:57.839 --> 05:00.216
(SIGHS) We went
to Midwood High School together.

05:00.341 --> 05:01.926
Looks like she did all right for herself.

05:02.927 --> 05:04.721
She married Barry 'cause she loved him.

05:05.221 --> 05:07.348
As far as the money’s concerned,
she could’ve cared less.

05:07.974 --> 05:10.810
-What does he do for a living?
-He’s in the jewelry business.

05:11.185 --> 05:14.188
-They have a good marriage?
-Beautiful.

05:15.898 --> 05:18.901
She was a beautiful person.
You know, she was like a saint.

05:19.777 --> 05:25.616
She was always like, "What can I do?
What’s wrong? Can I help you?"

05:26.492 --> 05:30.204
Strangers, she’d help.
Her friends or family, forget about it.

05:30.872 --> 05:34.667
Is there anyone that you know of
who might've had access to the place?

05:35.001 --> 05:37.587

the doorbell, she’d let them in.

-She’d hate that.

After that, I was home.

Which would be what time?

06:05.865 --> 06:07.116
Mass is 40 minutes.

06:07.283 --> 06:09.786
I stop at the candy store
and pick up the news.

06:10.578 --> 06:11.579
I’m home by 8:00.

06:11.954 --> 06:14.624

said he saw you sitting in the window.

Is this where you were sitting
when you came home?

or asleep in the bed, that’s it.

What time does your program start?

06:28.971 --> 06:30.056

Did you see any police officers
run into that building around 8:30?

I saw two of them go in there together.

-I wouldn’t say they were running.
-Did you see who they were chasing?

06:40.483 --> 06:41.901
Unfortunately, I didn’t.

You didn’t see a Black guy, 5’5", 5’6",

and an army jacket?

06:49.158 --> 06:50.159
I’m sorry.

Did you see anyone
that fits that description in the area

when you came back from church?

-This is who shot the cop?
-Yeah.

eye out for him, believe me.

Uh, this is Mr. Olshan and his attorney.

-Norman Haines. How do you do?
-Uh, hi. Why don’t we go back in here.

07:19.272 --> 07:21.441
I understand you need to get
started with your investigation,

-And where do you go from the shul?
-To the store.

-BALDWIN: And which is where?
-Canal and Mott.

07:47.550 --> 07:49.093
What does your wife
usually do in the morning?

07:49.719 --> 07:51.387
Seven o'clock, she goes to the gym,

07:52.555 --> 07:53.639
comes home,

07:54.974 --> 07:56.434
showers, dresses.

07:57.351 --> 07:58.728
Then she comes into the store.

08:01.063 --> 08:02.982
I’m talking about her
like she’s still here.

08:03.816 --> 08:05.985
Mr. Olshan, were there any
of your employees

08:06.110 --> 08:08.362
who might have been given access
to your home?

08:08.988 --> 08:12.074
-What kind of access?
-Keys, the alarm code.

08:12.325 --> 08:14.327
No. Why would I do that?

08:14.494 --> 08:16.662
From my understanding,
this was a robbery. Is that right?

08:16.746 --> 08:19.540
It would appear some things
may have been taken, but at this point,

08:19.832 --> 08:21.501
we don’t know if the motive was robbery.

08:22.251 --> 08:24.420
Sir, we’re gonna need a list
of people working for you.

08:24.629 --> 08:26.380
NORMAN: Guys, I'm not trying
to tell you how to do your job,

08:26.631 --> 08:29.759
but an expensive town house is a target
for anyone looking to do a robbery.

08:30.176 --> 08:32.345
Why are we focusing
on this being an inside job?

08:32.428 --> 08:34.096
There was no sign of forced entry.
So that means

08:34.222 --> 08:36.307
that someone either came to the door,
your wife let them in,

08:36.599 --> 08:37.808
or they knew how to get in.

08:37.934 --> 08:39.769
There’s no one working for me
you have to worry about.

08:40.102 --> 08:41.938
You may be right
but we still need to talk with them.

08:42.271 --> 08:43.856
Is there anyone you come into contact with

08:43.981 --> 08:45.483
who might be dealing
in stolen merchandise?

08:45.983 --> 08:48.694
-Why are you asking him that?
-Because we’d want to talk to that person.

08:48.778 --> 08:51.072
At this point, I’m gonna
have to terminate the interview.

08:51.280 --> 08:52.365
Counsel, we're just getting started.

08:52.490 --> 08:55.701
By the nature of your questioning,
you’ve made my client a suspect.

08:55.868 --> 08:58.246
No, showing up with a lawyer,
he’s made himself into a suspect.

08:58.329 --> 08:59.747
Where is it written
you can’t have a lawyer?

08:59.956 --> 09:03.042
Most people if they're finding out
their spouse has been murdered,

09:03.251 --> 09:04.252
don’t call a lawyer.

09:04.544 --> 09:06.462
You're telling me
I’m not grieving because he’s here?

You don’t have to respond to them, Barry.

09:08.089 --> 09:09.715
We're just telling you
it raises questions.

09:09.882 --> 09:11.175
I don’t care what it raises!

09:11.801 --> 09:15.263
I don’t care what you think of me!
I know how I felt about my wife!

09:15.805 --> 09:18.558

-His wife work here?
-Yeah.

09:44.959 --> 09:45.960

Are you aware of any
of the people working here

-Mister, this is a legitimate business.
-Nobody’s saying it isn’t.

of thousands worth of jewelry.

-She worked with you.

10:12.653 --> 10:13.821
I wouldn’t say "worked."

she came in the store.

10:16.115 --> 10:18.492
-(SPEAKING YIDDISH)
-They shouldn’t know the truth?

10:19.410 --> 10:21.871
She was not from the community.
Barry met her.

10:22.246 --> 10:24.081
Very exciting, very attractive.

10:24.373 --> 10:27.585
Everyone said,
"This is not someone you marry."

10:28.210 --> 10:32.381
But Barry didn’t listen.
So, now he has problems.

10:32.632 --> 10:34.008
And what kind of problems does he have?

10:34.425 --> 10:36.886
To lose a wife,
to bring shame on your family.

10:37.470 --> 10:38.929
Do you think Barry
had anything to do with it?

10:39.096 --> 10:41.974
-(SCOFFS)
-No. No. She doesn’t think nothing.

10:43.142 --> 10:46.062
Barry, in his way,
is trying to be a good Jew.

-And her friends...
-Enough!

10:53.444 --> 10:55.696
All right, Mr. Zell, we need to speak
to your wife by herself.

10:56.572 --> 10:57.657
Please.

11:02.787 --> 11:04.372
(SPEAKING YIDDISH)

11:06.999 --> 11:08.125
Who were her friends?

11:09.251 --> 11:13.130

It’s an Italian last name.

11:13.839 --> 11:16.050
Dresses like a streetwalker, smokes.

11:17.551 --> 11:18.719
She comes in to see Deborah,

11:18.969 --> 11:21.597
acts flirtatious with the men,
and I’m talking now

11:21.681 --> 11:23.766
about Deborah’s husband
and about my husband.

11:24.141 --> 11:27.645
-When’s the last time she was here?
-Last week. She and Deborah had words.

11:27.770 --> 11:31.440
I don’t know what it was about.
All I remember is Barry going over

11:31.649 --> 11:35.528
and saying, "The answer is no!"
Like that, strong.

11:35.820 --> 11:37.446
Were there problems
between Barry and his wife?

11:37.780 --> 11:40.574

11:41.033 --> 11:43.703
Barry was trying to get back in touch
with what it meant to be a Jew,

11:43.994 --> 11:46.414
and Deborah was trying to be
for him a good Jewish wife.

11:46.706 --> 11:50.584
And with all that,
this is who she’s friends with?

11:52.294 --> 11:55.256
Decent people go with decent people.

12:04.140 --> 12:05.182
Perez.

12:06.434 --> 12:09.186
-How’s he doing?
-I don’t know. They’re doing X-rays now.

12:09.812 --> 12:11.731
Maybe you could take us
through the sequence of events.

12:12.565 --> 12:14.817
I was driving.
Pat was in the passenger seat.

12:15.151 --> 12:17.945
We go past the Gomper Houses.
We turn left on Rivington.

12:18.195 --> 12:20.114
Pat spots the guy on the corner
of Rivington and Clinton.

12:20.781 --> 12:23.075
-What time was that?
-About 8:30.

12:23.409 --> 12:24.869
You saw what looked like it could be a gun

12:25.035 --> 12:26.662
under his coat
and you call him over to the car.

12:26.829 --> 12:27.830
What happens then?

12:28.080 --> 12:30.124
He ran down Clinton Street.
We followed him in the car.

12:30.624 --> 12:33.294
-Then what happened?
-About a third of the way down the block,

12:33.544 --> 12:35.254
he ran into this building
that was under construction.

12:35.713 --> 12:37.423
-Pat went in after him.
-What’d you do?

12:38.382 --> 12:41.343
I pulled the car over to the curb,
secured it, and went in after him.

12:42.511 --> 12:44.930
(SIGHS) As soon as I got inside,
I heard the shot.

12:45.306 --> 12:46.766
When I got to Pat, he was on the ground.

12:47.558 --> 12:49.477
-I stayed with him.
-So, you didn’t go in together?

12:49.894 --> 12:50.978
No.

12:52.146 --> 12:54.440
Any more details
on the description come to mind?

12:54.648 --> 12:58.569
(SIGHS) The hat he was wearing,
I think it had some kind of logo on it.

12:59.153 --> 13:00.988
We’d like you to come over
to the station house,

13:01.071 --> 13:02.114
take a look at some mug books.

13:02.740 --> 13:04.450
Sure. Any word on
whether they found the gun?

13:04.658 --> 13:05.785
Not yet.

13:10.956 --> 13:13.417
-How long on the roots?
-Thirty minutes.

13:15.002 --> 13:16.545
Uh, before today,

13:17.421 --> 13:19.507
when was the last time
you saw Debbie Olshan?

13:20.424 --> 13:22.384
-I saw her last week.
-And where was that?

13:22.635 --> 13:24.804
-I stopped by the store.
-JOHN: Just to visit?

13:25.679 --> 13:26.847
As opposed to what?

13:26.931 --> 13:29.600
Maybe there was something
that you had to talk to her about.

13:31.227 --> 13:34.522
What... Am I, like, a suspect here?
Is that what’s happening?

13:34.980 --> 13:37.358
-We’re talking to anybody who knew her.
-Oh.

13:38.943 --> 13:41.821
(SIGHS) She was gonna bank for me
to open up a salon in the city.

13:42.404 --> 13:44.532
We were talking about location and size.

13:44.907 --> 13:46.617
There was a million and one
details to go over,

13:46.826 --> 13:49.036
so, uh, that’s what it was.

13:49.912 --> 13:50.955
Were you having an argument?

13:51.413 --> 13:53.249
(SCOFFS) We were like sisters,
all right? I mean,

13:53.374 --> 13:56.710
sometimes we’d yell, sometimes we’d argue.
That’s what sisters do.

13:57.253 --> 14:00.881
Did it affect your relationship
that she started to get more religious?

14:01.131 --> 14:02.174
Oh, yeah, it did.

14:02.633 --> 14:05.177
I mean, when Barry started getting crazy
with all this Jewish stuff,

14:05.261 --> 14:07.096
Debbie had a big problem with it.

14:07.721 --> 14:10.808
I was her friend from her old life,

14:10.975 --> 14:13.978
which, you know, Barry’s whole orthodox
scene wanted nothing to do with.

14:14.687 --> 14:15.896
You still went over to the house, though.

14:16.397 --> 14:18.482
Yeah, sometimes.
You know, we’d go to lunch.

14:18.607 --> 14:20.359
You know, she’d go out once a week.

14:20.609 --> 14:22.778
I mean, the girl still liked to go out,
Jewish or no.

14:23.404 --> 14:24.405
Would she meet anybody going out?

14:24.905 --> 14:26.615
What, as in, like,
starting to see somebody?

14:27.116 --> 14:28.826
No, like somebody who might have
spotted a rock on her finger

14:28.993 --> 14:30.870
-and found out where she lived.
-(SIGHS)

14:32.830 --> 14:34.498
There was this Russian guy

14:34.582 --> 14:37.668
that we used to see every once in a while
when we’d go to the clubs.

14:38.127 --> 14:39.295
I mean, he was all over her.

14:40.004 --> 14:43.340
She had this five and a half carat
canary yellow diamond.

14:43.799 --> 14:44.800
It was gorgeous.

14:44.884 --> 14:48.053
I remember him making
a really big deal over it.

14:48.262 --> 14:49.430
Is there any reason
to believe he does robberies?

14:49.722 --> 14:52.558
I don't know, I didn’t think of this
before, but he used tell us

14:52.683 --> 14:56.186
if we ever needed Gucci or Prada
or Louis Vuitton, that he’d get it for us.

14:56.687 --> 14:58.480
-What’s his name?
-Mike.

14:58.981 --> 15:01.191
I never got his last name... (CHUCKLES)

15:01.483 --> 15:03.527
But Debbie used to call him
"Russian Mike."

15:04.153 --> 15:05.154
What does he look like?

15:05.237 --> 15:09.241
He had short hair, thin face,
really Russian-looking.

15:09.867 --> 15:12.703
I remember that he dressed nicer
than most of the Russians, though.

15:13.579 --> 15:17.499
-And he had a spider tattoo on his hand.
-Any idea where we can find him?

15:19.293 --> 15:23.631
There’s a restaurant on, uh,
Brighton Beach Avenue, called Olga’s.

15:23.756 --> 15:26.800
-I think he said he hung out there.
-Nuchie only wants you, sweetheart.

15:27.718 --> 15:29.970
-Sorry.
-Can I go finish up?

15:30.262 --> 15:31.305
Sure.

15:35.768 --> 15:37.519
Making any headway with this horror show?

15:38.187 --> 15:40.230
-Some.
-Maxine’s sick about it.

15:40.439 --> 15:41.941
FEMALE VOICE: Lenny, get over here!

15:51.033 --> 15:52.201
Hey, Jones, I’ll meet you up there.

15:55.329 --> 15:56.372
What’s new?

15:56.956 --> 15:58.666
Husband of the D.O.A.
showed up with his lawyer?

15:59.416 --> 16:02.086
Yeah, it might be there’s
some Russian involvement.

16:02.670 --> 16:04.797
Jewelry outfits work good
for laundering money.

16:05.506 --> 16:06.507
Yeah, that’s true.

16:08.300 --> 16:10.177
So, that’s a good arrangement,
you and Jones?

16:11.762 --> 16:12.763
I think.

16:13.806 --> 16:15.975
Obviously, I’d just as soon
be back working with you.

16:17.768 --> 16:19.603
Don’t be telling me that no more, okay?

16:20.896 --> 16:21.897
Okay.

-Who’s that?
-Mike.

16:48.549 --> 16:50.509
-I don’t know Mike.
-Where’s your boss?

16:50.884 --> 16:51.969
He’s not here.

16:52.094 --> 16:54.888
Mike has short hair.
He’s got a spider tattoo on his hand.

16:56.598 --> 16:57.766
I don’t know Mike.

16:58.267 --> 16:59.727
-What’s your name?
-Paulina.

17:00.144 --> 17:02.354
Tell us where he is now, Paulina,
nobody will know you told us.

17:02.563 --> 17:04.815
On the other hand,
if we find out you’re lying to us,

17:04.940 --> 17:07.192
we’ll come back when the place is full,
that way everyone will know.

17:07.276 --> 17:09.903
-(SIGHS) Why you think I’m lying?
-He said "if."

17:13.574 --> 17:17.286
-I don’t know Mike. I know Micha.
-He fits the description?

17:18.495 --> 17:21.540
-Two blocks this way, a blue building.
-JOHN: What’s his name on the buzzer?

17:22.249 --> 17:24.501
-Noishikov.
-Thank you, Paulina.

17:24.877 --> 17:26.170
You don’t come back now?

17:26.920 --> 17:29.548
-If we find him there, we won’t come back.
-Good.

17:43.562 --> 17:45.814

for the pain. It’s all right.

This is my wife, Teresa.

17:48.358 --> 17:50.027
I’m Detective Ortiz.
This is Detective Murphy.

17:50.319 --> 17:51.528
Nice to meet you.

17:51.820 --> 17:53.655
We need to go over
the sequence of events with you.

17:54.031 --> 17:55.949
-Do you want me to wait outside?
-No, it don’t matter.

17:58.285 --> 18:00.329
(SIGHS) Okay, where do you
want me to start?

18:00.788 --> 18:02.289
Um, when you spotted the guy.

18:03.916 --> 18:06.752
Anthony was driving.
I was in the passenger seat.

18:07.336 --> 18:08.504
It was about 8:30.

18:09.088 --> 18:12.049
We called him over to the car,
and he took off.

18:12.424 --> 18:14.802
-RITA: Where was this?
-Corner of Clinton and Rivington.

18:15.177 --> 18:17.596
-You follow him in the car?
-About a third of the way down the block,

18:17.763 --> 18:21.350
where he ran into this building
with a construction fence around it.

18:22.226 --> 18:24.019
I jumped out and ran in after him.

18:24.520 --> 18:26.438
-What about your partner?
-He came in after me.

18:27.106 --> 18:28.357
-After you?
-Right.

18:29.525 --> 18:31.527
What happened once you got
inside the construction fence?

18:32.069 --> 18:35.155
I stepped into a doorway.
I looked to my right,

18:35.322 --> 18:37.699
and there was some kind
of concrete forms for a stairway.

18:39.076 --> 18:42.538
And this guy stepped out
from behind them, fired one shot.

18:43.914 --> 18:45.415
I went down, and that was it.

18:46.333 --> 18:47.751
RITA: Where was your partner
at this point?

18:48.252 --> 18:50.129
He came running in
after he heard the shot.

18:50.629 --> 18:51.713
Then he stayed with me.

18:52.381 --> 18:55.175
If I know Anthony,
he wishes it was him who got shot.

18:56.051 --> 18:57.052
Definitely.

18:57.553 --> 18:59.930
Anything else occur to you
by way of description?

19:00.347 --> 19:02.432
-I say he had a knit hat on?
-RITA: Yeah, you did.

19:03.517 --> 19:05.394
I think it had some kind of logo on it.

19:06.603 --> 19:08.981
We’ve managed to locate a witness
who saw you go into the building.

19:09.398 --> 19:10.399
Oh, yeah?

19:11.108 --> 19:14.278
Yeah, there’s some discrepancies
between her account and your account.

19:15.571 --> 19:16.697
Like what?

19:16.822 --> 19:18.657
She said you and your partner
went in together.

19:18.782 --> 19:19.783
You say you went in separately.

19:20.409 --> 19:21.577
Maybe she figures,

19:22.619 --> 19:25.414
him coming in right after me
is like going in together.

19:26.248 --> 19:28.125
-I don't know.
-She said neither one of you were running.

19:28.667 --> 19:31.003
-She’s wrong.
-And she didn’t see you chasing anyone.

19:31.253 --> 19:33.505
So she didn't see, so what does that mean?

19:33.881 --> 19:36.175
Maybe she got distracted.
Maybe she’s nearsighted.

19:36.258 --> 19:37.301
TERESA: Pat, don’t get excited.

19:37.426 --> 19:40.095
No, I mean they’re acting like
this is some major contradiction here.

19:40.304 --> 19:41.305
RITA: It’s also sounding a little bit

19:41.388 --> 19:43.307
like you and your partner
might have rehearsed some of your answers.

19:45.976 --> 19:48.812
-Are you trying to piss me off?
-I think I’m gonna wait outside.

19:49.730 --> 19:51.607
(SIGHS) We’re just trying
to find out what happened.

19:51.815 --> 19:54.151
I told you what happened, I got shot.

19:54.526 --> 19:56.028
We need to know the circumstances.

19:56.236 --> 19:59.448
The circumstances are exactly
what I told you they were,

19:59.781 --> 20:01.909
exactly what Perez told you they were.

being cross-examined

you’re gonna have
to wait till I’m out of here

20:09.458 --> 20:11.210
and I got a delegate sitting next to me.

20:12.127 --> 20:13.587
Maybe we’ll talk to you again
when you’re feeling a little better.

20:26.433 --> 20:28.227
That wife knows something
she’s not saying.

20:28.352 --> 20:29.353
You think?

20:29.728 --> 20:31.855
I think we need to go back there
and talk to her by herself.

20:34.107 --> 20:37.277
A patrol found a gun in a garbage can
near where the shooting was.

We banged into the joint for the one guy.

23:03.548 --> 23:06.343
Bill hadn’t gotten in yet.
Another guy comes out of a back door,

23:07.260 --> 23:09.262
-got a shot off, and split.
-How’s he doing?

23:09.888 --> 23:12.057
-They just took him into surgery.
-It ain’t good.

23:12.557 --> 23:15.060
-Who’s with the one you brought in?
-Greg brought him back to the house.

-No, sir.

Andy, come here.

23:25.737 --> 23:27.864
I want you working this case.
I’ll notify the Chief of Patrol.

-Get out of the bag, back in a suit.
-You got it.

(SIGHS) Okay, guys, you heard that.

23:42.629 --> 23:44.631
-How is he?
-He was still in surgery when we left.

23:46.299 --> 23:47.384
Where’s your lawyer?

23:48.844 --> 23:51.513

to you without him.

23:55.642 --> 23:56.935

He said there are things
I need to tell you.

24:00.939 --> 24:02.023
Like what?

24:02.315 --> 24:05.485
The reason I came here
with my lawyer was, I was afraid

24:05.652 --> 24:08.488
-you would want to look into my business.
-What are you afraid we’d find?

24:09.573 --> 24:11.908
-That I move money around.
-JOHN: You laundered money?

24:13.034 --> 24:14.995
-Yeah.
-Who are the people you did it for?

24:15.287 --> 24:19.082
Look, I didn’t come to cast blame.
I did this... this was my transgression.

24:19.499 --> 24:21.460
I don’t think it had anything to do
with what happened to Deborah.

24:21.668 --> 24:23.712
We need the names
of the people you did it for.

24:23.795 --> 24:26.256
This was a robbery, I don’t think
they get involved with robberies.

24:26.465 --> 24:27.507
We can't assume that.

24:27.632 --> 24:29.176
If they didn’t,
I’ve gotten them into trouble

for something I’m just as
responsible for as they are.

-He works with Maxine.

She doesn’t live the most
upstanding life in the world but,

25:01.500 --> 25:03.335
it was important that Deborah
maintain that relationship.

25:03.710 --> 25:07.047
-Anyway, one day she brings over Lenny.
-When’s the last time you talked to him?

25:07.714 --> 25:08.840
A couple of weeks ago.

25:09.174 --> 25:11.551
(SCOFFS) He wanted
to open a salon in the city,

25:11.676 --> 25:13.553
which suddenly became my responsibility.

25:14.304 --> 25:17.641
There’s a lease that had to be signed.
He had given notice.

I told him I didn’t want
to be involved with him anymore.

25:20.977 --> 25:24.731
-Has he been to your house?
-No. I kept all that away from my house.

why your husband would lie
about this shooting?

25:53.343 --> 25:54.344
No.

25:55.845 --> 26:01.476
Well, if he is, it’s really best
that we find out sooner rather than later.

26:01.935 --> 26:04.521
And that it’s us that finds out
rather than Internal Affairs.

26:05.313 --> 26:06.606
Why would he lie?

26:07.691 --> 26:10.068
If he’s involved
in some kinda illegal activity

26:10.193 --> 26:12.737
and the shooting stems from that,
he might be lying to cover it up.

26:12.862 --> 26:15.282
Pat would never be involved
in anything illegal.

26:16.199 --> 26:18.368
If you knew him,
you would never even suggest that.

26:19.411 --> 26:21.830
Maybe it’s his partner,
and he’s lying to protect him.

honest, totally straight.

any more money-laundering deals,

34:36.449 --> 34:39.577
Does he realize he still gets three
quarters if it’s an accidental shooting?

34:39.869 --> 34:42.455
-I don't know.
-I don’t know why he didn’t just say that.

34:43.623 --> 34:46.125
-Do we need to call Internal Affairs?
-(SIGHING)

34:47.585 --> 34:48.961
I’ll adjust the paperwork.

34:49.170 --> 34:50.963
It’ll read "accidental,"
and we’ll hope for the best.

34:51.672 --> 34:53.758
Even though the Borough
thinks he was shot by a perp?

34:54.467 --> 34:57.261
Hopefully, when they find out he’s sick,
they’ll leave it be.

35:06.771 --> 35:08.272
-Thanks, Hank.
-Anytime.

35:10.483 --> 35:11.567
(JOHN SIGHS)

35:12.193 --> 35:13.277
(DOOR CLOSES)

35:13.820 --> 35:16.531
-Well, Maxine, we got a couple problems.
-What?

35:18.407 --> 35:20.701
Well, the first is,
you sent us on a wild goose chase

35:20.868 --> 35:22.995
that resulted in a cop getting shot.

35:24.205 --> 35:25.540
What am I? Clairvoyant?

35:25.790 --> 35:28.084
Am I supposed to know
a cop’s gonna get shot?

35:28.376 --> 35:29.877
Look, I told you about a Russian guy

35:29.961 --> 35:32.004
who I thought might have
murdered my friend, sorry.

35:32.213 --> 35:33.673
Well, then that brings up
the second problem,

35:33.923 --> 35:35.341
which is Lenny just confessed.

35:35.633 --> 35:37.135
Lenny, as in Lenny Russo?

35:37.218 --> 35:39.971
Mm-hmm. He said he went there
to burglarize the place.

35:40.096 --> 35:42.390
Debbie walked in,
and he wound up killing her.

35:43.141 --> 35:45.768
Oh, God. I think I’m gonna be sick.

35:50.148 --> 35:52.400
He says you gave him the key
and the alarm code.

35:52.567 --> 35:53.776
I did?

35:53.901 --> 35:56.821
I think Lenny’s gone off the deep end,
is what I think happened.

35:58.364 --> 35:59.407
Look...

36:00.992 --> 36:03.661
Debbie and her husband reneged on
putting up money for your salon.

36:04.120 --> 36:06.539
It’s not hard to understand
you thinking something was owed.

36:06.998 --> 36:09.292
You actually believe him
that I had anything to do with this?

36:09.709 --> 36:11.210
We’re just trying to make sense
of what happened here.

36:11.377 --> 36:13.379
Well, try a little harder.
I mean, why would I get involved

36:13.588 --> 36:16.090
with robbing a girl I grew up with?
For what?

36:16.465 --> 36:17.717
A five and a half carat yellow diamond.

36:17.884 --> 36:19.177
No way, you’ve got the wrong girl.

36:19.302 --> 36:21.304
Well, you do have a key.
You do know the alarm code.

36:21.429 --> 36:23.306
Lenny could’ve gotten in
by ringing the doorbell.

36:23.389 --> 36:24.724
And Debbie knew him,
she would’ve let him in.

36:24.891 --> 36:27.435
Yeah, but then the body probably wouldn’t
have been found in the bedroom.

36:27.602 --> 36:30.104
-Then there is a matter of the phone call.
-What phone call?

36:30.313 --> 36:32.940
The call that Lenny made
to you after he killed Debbie.

36:33.316 --> 36:34.859
BALDWIN: Yeah, before you say
there was no call,

36:35.026 --> 36:36.903
keep in mind we’re gonna
dump the Olshans’ phone,

36:37.028 --> 36:38.988
Lenny’s phone, and your phone.

36:39.113 --> 36:40.698
And since what you did after
you got the call

36:40.823 --> 36:42.783
was you went to the house,
you let yourself in,

36:42.909 --> 36:44.869
and then you pretended
to have discovered the body...

36:45.411 --> 36:48.664
(CHUCKLES) ...it’d be hard to find
a grand jury that wouldn’t indict.

36:49.123 --> 36:51.083
Are you saying that I’m responsible
for killing her?

36:51.792 --> 36:53.669
It’s not up to us to say
what you’re responsible for.

36:53.794 --> 36:56.589
All we can do is tell you that it is
in your best interest at this point

36:56.881 --> 36:57.882
to tell the truth.

37:00.509 --> 37:03.679
Me and Lenny been working
on Avenue J for six and a half years.

37:03.804 --> 37:06.515
We weren’t looking for a free ride.
We were just looking to better ourselves.

37:06.641 --> 37:09.268
-Is there anything so wrong with that?
-Not at all.

37:09.644 --> 37:13.522
Then there’s Debbie, you know, same as me,
except now she marries a rich husband.

37:14.398 --> 37:15.858
And she said she would help.

37:16.609 --> 37:19.028
Then Barry got religion,
and the two of them start acting

37:19.153 --> 37:21.364
like they’re having God over
for coffee and cake.

37:21.781 --> 37:22.949
And then she can’t do it no more.

37:23.616 --> 37:25.785
And meanwhile, he’s laundering
money for drug dealers,

37:25.952 --> 37:28.162
and she used to bang guys
to get a ride to Atlantic City.

37:30.164 --> 37:31.624
Lenny’s right about one thing, you know,

37:32.416 --> 37:35.127
she should have never said anything
if she wasn’t gonna come through.

37:35.378 --> 37:36.963
You didn’t know Lenny was gonna kill her.

37:37.922 --> 37:40.508
You figured by the time she came home,
he’d be long gone.

37:44.887 --> 37:46.222
There was a pair of diamond earrings

37:46.305 --> 37:50.309
and a double-stranded pearl necklace
in her top drawer of her dressing table.

37:51.060 --> 37:53.854
It was worth 100,000 dollars,
we would have been done.

37:54.313 --> 37:56.357
But instead, he decides
to go see what else there is.

37:56.440 --> 37:57.650
And you gave him the key.

38:00.027 --> 38:01.112
Yeah.

38:02.989 --> 38:04.991
-Hey, how’s the Lieutenant?
-(TELEPHONE RINGING)

38:05.741 --> 38:08.619
He’s out of surgery in I.C.U.
All they’re saying is he’s stable.

38:09.287 --> 38:11.789
He had his spleen removed,
and there may be kidney damage.

38:12.081 --> 38:13.833
-BALDWIN: No prognosis, though?
-Not yet.

38:14.500 --> 38:15.626
What do we know about the shooter?

38:16.002 --> 38:18.462
I got the Russian
to give us his name and addresses.

38:18.713 --> 38:20.798
Queens homicide hit the one in Regal Park,

38:21.090 --> 38:23.301
and the Jersey State Police
hit the one in Fort Lee.

38:23.718 --> 38:26.429
The information he gave us was good.
We just came up empty.

38:26.846 --> 38:27.847
Are we sitting on them?

38:28.389 --> 38:30.516
That and turning Brighton Beach
upside down.

38:30.891 --> 38:32.059
What happened with the two you brought in?

38:32.310 --> 38:33.394
(SIGHS) They went for it.

38:33.561 --> 38:36.355
He went to do a burglary and got
walked in on. She set it up.

38:36.647 --> 38:38.566
Yeah, what do you think we should do
with the husband’s money laundering?

38:38.774 --> 38:42.278
(SIGHS) The guy lost his wife.
Let that be enough punishment for one day.

38:42.486 --> 38:45.448
I.R.S. wants to go after him
for money laundering, that’s up to them.

38:46.032 --> 38:47.867
What are they gonna do
for a Lieutenant around here?

38:48.659 --> 38:50.536
They’ll send in a covering boss
from Borough.

38:50.995 --> 38:52.079
What are they doing with you?

38:52.997 --> 38:56.125
They want me to work this case.
After that, I go back downstairs.

39:00.463 --> 39:02.173
Isn’t today Detective Medavoy’s last day?

39:02.757 --> 39:05.926
-Oh, I forgot all about that.
-We’re gonna throw him a racket.

39:06.177 --> 39:07.845
I know but we should have done
something for him today.

39:07.928 --> 39:09.597
Let me go talk to him.

39:14.560 --> 39:15.728
(SIGHS)

39:17.188 --> 39:20.399
You know, uh...
With all that’s been going on,

39:20.524 --> 39:22.902
we kind of lost sight
of the fact that you’re leaving us.

39:24.028 --> 39:27.490
Yeah, I have to say,
I’ve been having second thoughts.

39:28.324 --> 39:29.367
Oh, yeah?

39:29.450 --> 39:31.369
It’s no time to be leaving
when one of our own was hit.

39:33.079 --> 39:35.164
I don’t know if that should cause you
to have second thoughts.

39:36.916 --> 39:39.001
I’ve been part of this squad
for a long time, Andy.

39:40.419 --> 39:43.130
When we divided up the chores
and went with finding out

39:43.214 --> 39:44.298
who did some awful thing,

39:45.466 --> 39:49.136
when we went out to run at the ground,
I was part of that.

39:49.678 --> 39:51.347
ANDY: Awful things happen every day, Greg,

39:52.306 --> 39:54.225
and every day,
they’ll be dividing up the chores

39:54.809 --> 39:56.977
after you’re gone, after I’m gone.

39:58.479 --> 39:59.730
But you’re not leaving.

40:06.821 --> 40:08.155
The day will come when I will be.

40:11.200 --> 40:14.412
And just like you,
I’ll take some of this place with me.

40:14.787 --> 40:17.873
Just like you,
I’ll leave a part of myself behind.

40:19.041 --> 40:20.835
The important thing
is that you got something

40:20.960 --> 40:22.211
that you’re gonna be going to.

40:23.504 --> 40:25.673
Hmm. Yeah.

40:27.299 --> 40:28.342
I do.

40:29.468 --> 40:31.470
It’s probably right that you should go
when you planned on it.

40:33.431 --> 40:35.141
-Hey, Andy.
-What?

40:36.767 --> 40:37.852
Can I take your picture now?

40:44.442 --> 40:45.734
ANDY: Hey, junior, come here.

40:53.367 --> 40:54.952
We should take a picture of the two of us.

41:01.876 --> 41:02.877
All right, on three.

41:04.503 --> 41:08.215
One, two, three.
