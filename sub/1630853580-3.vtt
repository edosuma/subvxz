[rock music playing]

00:04.091 --> 00:06.441
-[laughter]
-Oh. And this one time

00:06.484 --> 00:08.138
I made a hundred clones
of myself

00:08.182 --> 00:10.227
so I could rob
a hundred banks at once.

00:11.098 --> 00:12.882
Yeah, it was all fun and games

00:12.925 --> 00:14.057
until one of his clones
got weird

00:14.101 --> 00:15.841
and forced us to call him Papa.

00:17.104 --> 00:19.019
What about that time
I used my sonic scream

00:19.062 --> 00:20.368
to distract Captain Valor

00:20.411 --> 00:21.934
so Jake could
crush him with a boulder?

00:23.066 --> 00:24.676
That sounds violent.

00:24.720 --> 00:26.026
It was.

00:28.028 --> 00:29.725
So where was Colby

00:29.768 --> 00:32.336
while you're all off
doing those horrible things?

00:32.380 --> 00:33.555
With the babysitter.

00:34.817 --> 00:37.341
Wait, supervillains
use babysitters?

00:37.385 --> 00:39.909
Okay, fine. We left them home
to play with the rats.

00:41.432 --> 00:43.869
I'd say I'm horrified.
But from what I know about you

00:43.913 --> 00:45.088
that's pretty on brand.

00:46.655 --> 00:48.135
Hearing these stories
just reminds me

00:48.178 --> 00:49.875
that I never got
to be a villain.

00:49.919 --> 00:51.790
I've waited
my whole life to get a power

00:51.834 --> 00:54.097
so I can prove that I'm not
just the run of the family

00:54.141 --> 00:55.272
and now I will never
even get a chance

00:55.316 --> 00:56.273
to fight
with the rest of you.

00:56.317 --> 00:58.232
Yeah, that's rough.

00:58.275 --> 00:59.885
Who wants to do a puzzle?

01:05.326 --> 01:07.763
If you're trying to find
a new look, that ain't it.

01:09.156 --> 01:10.809
I was looking
for a clean pair of socks

01:10.853 --> 01:12.246
in the laundry
and this happened,

01:12.289 --> 01:14.161
the dry Texas heat wave

01:14.204 --> 01:16.119
must be affecting
my electrical power.

01:16.163 --> 01:17.947
Static electricity. Urgh!

01:17.990 --> 01:20.167
All You Need Is Love?

01:20.210 --> 01:22.430
Hartley, how did your shirt
get in our laundry?

01:22.473 --> 01:23.561
That's not mine.

01:23.605 --> 01:24.693
It could be anybody's.

01:26.477 --> 01:28.218
Eva, you better get cleaned up.

01:28.262 --> 01:30.525
I ran into our neighbor
Mr. Tennyson at the store.

01:30.568 --> 01:33.180
He said he's gonna swing by with
a housewarming cheese platter.

01:33.223 --> 01:34.746
Why would you let
a complete stranger

01:34.790 --> 01:35.965
invite himself into our house?

01:36.008 --> 01:37.532
Were you not listening?

01:37.575 --> 01:38.750
Free cheese.

01:41.013 --> 01:43.494
You can't say no when
Mr. Tennyson wants to visit.

01:43.538 --> 01:45.148
He's head
of the neighborhood watch

01:45.192 --> 01:46.671
and he checks up on everyone

01:46.715 --> 01:47.933
who moves in around here.

01:47.977 --> 01:49.500
Then we better be careful.

01:49.544 --> 01:51.285
We don't wanna make him
suspicious about us.

01:51.328 --> 01:53.461
Don't worry. We'll let him in.
We'll take his cheese

01:53.504 --> 01:54.940
and then we'll send him
on his way.

01:56.420 --> 01:59.162
And then we'll tell him
we're gonna return his plate

01:59.206 --> 02:00.685
but we never will.

02:02.034 --> 02:03.949
Now that right there,
that's weird.

02:03.993 --> 02:06.735
Relax, Jake.
We know how to act normal.

02:06.778 --> 02:08.171
[electric zaps]

02:08.215 --> 02:09.999
Oh.

02:10.042 --> 02:12.132
Well, save me some cheese.

[theme music playing]

02:26.363 --> 02:28.365
[rock music playing]

02:30.237 --> 02:31.847
-Hey, what are you up to?
-Shh.

02:33.370 --> 02:36.156
Let's see. What else
can I shapeshift into?

02:36.199 --> 02:38.158
Oh, I know.

02:40.638 --> 02:43.946
Stand back, superheroes,
or I'll chainsaw you,

02:43.989 --> 02:46.557
as soon as I learn
how to pull my own starter cord.

02:50.387 --> 02:51.867
This is lame.

02:51.910 --> 02:53.521
I wish I could be
a real villain.

02:53.564 --> 02:56.176
Poor kid can't even pull
his own cord.

02:57.220 --> 02:58.569
I feel so bad for him.

02:58.613 --> 03:00.789
He never even got
a villain name or a suit.

03:00.832 --> 03:04.096
Aw, listen to you thinking about
someone other than yourself.

03:05.185 --> 03:06.795
I have to do it
every once in a while

03:06.838 --> 03:08.405
to make
the selfishness pop.

03:10.581 --> 03:12.148
You know, all he wants
is to be a villain.

03:12.192 --> 03:13.976
There's got to be a way
we can make that happen,

03:14.019 --> 03:16.065
-even for a day.
-Look, I feel bad too

03:16.108 --> 03:18.067
but we're on the run
so we can't.

03:18.110 --> 03:20.504
Hey, at least he's not sitting
around playing with the rats.

03:20.548 --> 03:22.071
[rat squeaking]

03:22.114 --> 03:23.028
Randy?

03:23.072 --> 03:24.552
Is that you, old friend?

03:27.119 --> 03:28.730
Yeah, we got to help this kid.

03:31.211 --> 03:32.386
It's good thing
I'm here to help you

03:32.429 --> 03:34.431
get ready
for Mr. Tennyson's visit.

03:34.475 --> 03:36.564
I found your weird devices
all over the house.

03:36.607 --> 03:39.044
Yeah, I don't feel safe
without a face melter handy.

03:41.264 --> 03:43.048
I got two next to the toilet.

03:44.702 --> 03:46.400
These things melt faces?

03:46.443 --> 03:47.879
Everyone but this one.

03:47.923 --> 03:49.577
It's out of batteries.

03:49.620 --> 03:51.492
Hey, do you have
any batteries I can borrow?

03:56.975 --> 03:58.150
There.

04:02.372 --> 04:03.373
There.

04:12.469 --> 04:13.601
There.

04:14.645 --> 04:16.952
Now everything around here
looks presentable.

04:16.995 --> 04:19.171
[footsteps]

04:19.215 --> 04:21.173
[laughs]

04:22.174 --> 04:25.308
Whoa. That hair
is even too big for Texas.

04:26.614 --> 04:28.180
I got rid of the laundry.

04:28.224 --> 04:31.009
And now the dryer
is affecting other things.

04:31.053 --> 04:34.665
You know what? I'm sure
we can fix it with some hair gel

04:35.753 --> 04:37.102
or a bucket of hair gel.

04:38.887 --> 04:41.150
Or forget the gel
and just go with a bucket.

04:43.195 --> 04:45.981
[sighs] It's not just my hair.

04:46.024 --> 04:48.026
Ouch. [groans]

04:48.070 --> 04:50.986
Isn't your power
to control electricity?

04:51.029 --> 04:53.336
Usually I can, but
when the weather is this dry,

04:53.380 --> 04:56.034
everything I touch
gets a huge static shock.

04:57.427 --> 05:00.735
On the plus side, I can roast
a chicken with my bare hands.

05:02.171 --> 05:03.564
[bell dings]

05:03.607 --> 05:06.044
-Oh, he's here.
-Okay. I can fix this.

05:06.088 --> 05:09.091
I'll go to the lair and create
a microclimate machine

05:09.134 --> 05:11.136
that can add humidity
to the air.

05:11.180 --> 05:13.400
So a humidifier?

05:14.662 --> 05:17.099
No, a microclimate machine.

05:18.274 --> 05:19.623
What's the difference?

05:19.667 --> 05:21.321
This one will have more buttons.

05:23.366 --> 05:26.238
[rock music playing]

05:26.282 --> 05:28.589
So this is my big surprise?

05:28.632 --> 05:30.286
School on a Saturday.

05:30.330 --> 05:32.680
I canceled plans
with Randy the Rat for this.

05:34.072 --> 05:35.378
I'm out of here.

05:35.422 --> 05:37.554
Halt, evil doer.

05:37.598 --> 05:40.427
It is I,
The Honorable Captain Valor,

05:40.470 --> 05:43.081
and I'm here to make you pay
for your villainous crimes.

05:43.125 --> 05:44.256
Hey, Jake.

05:45.388 --> 05:46.737
How did you know it was me?

05:46.781 --> 05:48.739
Same shoes, lame costume,

05:48.783 --> 05:51.089
and I never met him before but
I'm pretty sure Captain Valor

05:51.133 --> 05:52.787
doesn't wear
Harry Styles cologne.

05:54.441 --> 05:55.398
He might.

05:56.965 --> 05:59.010
-Jake, what is this?
-It's what we talked about,

05:59.054 --> 06:00.882
Colby's villain experience.

06:00.925 --> 06:03.058
Well, who gave you total
control of the planning?

06:03.101 --> 06:04.929
-You did?
-You literally said

06:04.973 --> 06:06.104
take care of it.
I don't wanna do

06:06.148 --> 06:07.715
-any of the work.
-Yeah.

06:07.758 --> 06:08.977
That does sound like me.

06:10.282 --> 06:13.068
What do you mean
my villain experience?

06:13.111 --> 06:15.853
We knew you were bummed about
never getting to be a villain,

06:15.897 --> 06:18.029
so Jake and I wanted
to give you a break

06:18.073 --> 06:19.770
from your otherwise
pointless life.

06:21.903 --> 06:23.513
And congratulations, Colby.

06:23.557 --> 06:25.472
You just completed
your first villain deed,

06:25.515 --> 06:27.387
breaking into private property.

06:28.431 --> 06:30.172
The door was unlocked.

06:30.215 --> 06:32.043
We just opened it and walked in.

06:32.087 --> 06:33.784
I mean, that's not even
breaking and entering,

06:33.828 --> 06:35.525
that's just entering.

06:36.613 --> 06:39.355
Well, the cleaning crew
just went on break.

06:39.399 --> 06:41.531
So time for us to have some fun,

06:41.575 --> 06:42.967
ooh, but not too much fun,

06:43.011 --> 06:44.491
we don't wanna make
a mess for them.

06:45.535 --> 06:47.015
I'm going home
to play with the rat.

06:47.058 --> 06:48.408
No, Colby, wait.

06:48.451 --> 06:49.974
We brought you here
to be a villain.

06:50.018 --> 06:51.585
So go ahead.

06:51.628 --> 06:53.282
Knock this clown on his butt.

06:55.110 --> 06:57.242
Really?
I could take all my years

06:57.286 --> 06:59.114
of frustration out on Jake?

06:59.157 --> 07:01.769
Yup. And you can
take some of mine, too.

07:03.205 --> 07:05.425
Okay.
What can I shapeshift into

07:05.468 --> 07:07.165
that'll hurt him the most?

07:07.209 --> 07:09.733
A rocket launcher?
Or a flame thrower?

07:09.777 --> 07:12.127
A picture
from his leather pants face.

07:13.389 --> 07:15.696
You know what?
Why talk about hurting him

07:15.739 --> 07:17.175
when we could
just do it?

07:17.219 --> 07:19.177
[grunting]

07:20.352 --> 07:24.052
Amy, you're supposed
to let him do it.

07:24.095 --> 07:25.357
Sorry.

07:26.358 --> 07:28.665
I'm not sorry. [laughs]

07:28.709 --> 07:31.233
Okay. So if we're
gonna play that game.

07:31.276 --> 07:33.322
How about
a little villain training?

07:33.365 --> 07:35.150
Since you've ever been
in a battle before,

07:35.193 --> 07:38.196
here's a tip, best way
to attack your opponent is...

07:38.240 --> 07:40.982
[Amy groans]

07:41.025 --> 07:43.158
...to catch them off guard.

07:43.201 --> 07:44.725
Good one.

07:44.768 --> 07:46.422
But here's a better one.

07:46.466 --> 07:47.945
[grunts]

07:51.471 --> 07:54.082
Aw, even the losers
got a trophy.

07:55.213 --> 07:57.041
That's it. You're going down.

07:57.085 --> 08:00.175
[scoffs] I'm gonna use that cape
to mop the floor with you.

08:01.350 --> 08:03.134
Please don't, it's a rental.

08:03.178 --> 08:04.788
Let's do this.

08:06.094 --> 08:07.617
I thought
you said this was about me?

08:07.661 --> 08:09.837
Not now, Colby.
The grown-ups are fighting.

08:12.056 --> 08:12.927
[grunts]

08:14.232 --> 08:17.105
[Colby groans]

08:17.148 --> 08:18.062
Uh-oh.

08:19.368 --> 08:22.066
Looks like the cleaning crew
is gonna be working overtime.

08:25.287 --> 08:28.290
[rock music playing]

08:32.512 --> 08:35.079
-Colby, are you okay?
-No, he's not okay.

08:35.123 --> 08:36.603
You just attacked
an innocent child.

08:36.646 --> 08:38.430
Well, I was aiming for you,
so technically

08:38.474 --> 08:40.607
it's your fault
for jumping out of the way.

08:40.650 --> 08:43.044
You're both to blame.
Now, could someone please

08:43.087 --> 08:45.220
do something about my leg?
It really hurts.

08:45.263 --> 08:46.874
Should we take him
to the hospital?

08:46.917 --> 08:48.049
We can't.
They'll ask too many questions

08:48.092 --> 08:49.616
that can expose our secret.

08:49.659 --> 08:51.008
Plus hospitals
make me feel guilty.

08:51.052 --> 08:52.140
I've put a lot
of people in them.

08:54.011 --> 08:55.883
Why doesn't Colby just
shapeshift into an animal

08:55.926 --> 08:57.101
and we take him to the vet?

08:58.233 --> 09:00.104
I mean, I have caught him
on more than one occasion

09:00.148 --> 09:01.802
licking himself.

09:03.151 --> 09:05.109
That's actually not a bad idea.

09:05.153 --> 09:07.459
That way they can fix his leg
without us getting caught.

09:07.503 --> 09:09.287
No way, I'm not doing that.

09:09.331 --> 09:11.028
Okay.
And I'll just fix your leg.

09:11.072 --> 09:14.205
Ow! [cries]

09:14.249 --> 09:15.729
Okay. [exhales]

09:15.772 --> 09:17.731
But if I'm gonna turn
into an animal,

09:17.774 --> 09:19.123
it's gonna be something rad.

09:22.039 --> 09:23.911
Hi, we're here
to have our pet looked at.

09:23.954 --> 09:25.042
Okay. What kind of animal is it?

09:25.086 --> 09:26.174
It's a bobcat.

09:26.217 --> 09:28.872
[growls]

09:28.916 --> 09:30.918
We don't take bobcats.

09:30.961 --> 09:34.095
Oh, well, in that case it's a...

09:35.966 --> 09:38.186
No, no.

09:38.229 --> 09:39.404
Ew, no.

09:39.448 --> 09:40.928
No.

09:42.103 --> 09:43.931
That works. It's a turtle.

09:50.546 --> 09:54.202
A lovely cheese spread
as always, Mr. Tennyson.

09:54.245 --> 09:57.118
You could tell I care
because I added grapes.

09:59.381 --> 10:01.252
Uh-uh. Not for you.

10:02.471 --> 10:05.561
So, where are
Mr. and Mrs. Mayhem?

10:05.605 --> 10:07.302
The cheddar is sweating.

10:08.825 --> 10:11.349
I'm sure
they'll be out any second.

10:11.393 --> 10:14.135
Really? Because it feels like
they're trying to avoid me.

10:14.178 --> 10:16.137
The last people
who tried to avoid me

10:16.180 --> 10:17.834
turned out to be smuggling
counterfeit yoga pants

10:17.878 --> 10:19.140
out of their basement.

10:19.183 --> 10:21.925
And what happened to them?

10:21.969 --> 10:24.188
I called the authorities,
now they're in jail

10:24.232 --> 10:26.190
and I'm doing
tree pose in style.

10:28.149 --> 10:31.718
[sighs] They thought they could
pull one over on me. Wrong.

10:32.762 --> 10:34.155
I'm gonna go
check on Mrs. Mayhem.

10:40.465 --> 10:43.251
If you're looking for
a hiding spot, that ain't it.

10:45.427 --> 10:47.211
You have to get out there.

10:47.255 --> 10:49.605
Mr. Tennyson just told me
he put the last people

10:49.649 --> 10:51.389
who made him suspicious
behind bars.

10:52.477 --> 10:53.957
But Vic's machine
isn't done yet.

10:54.001 --> 10:55.698
I still can't control my power.

10:55.742 --> 10:57.831
Just cover your hair.

10:59.006 --> 11:00.224
-Right.
-[screams]

11:01.399 --> 11:03.184
And don't touch anything.

11:04.315 --> 11:05.534
Right. [gasp]

11:07.797 --> 11:10.234
Sorry.

11:10.278 --> 11:12.019
I got it now.

11:15.457 --> 11:18.068
-What does this do?
-No.

11:18.112 --> 11:20.592
No. Uh-uh.

11:20.636 --> 11:22.507
Not for you. [chuckles]

11:24.727 --> 11:26.468
Oh, hello.

11:26.511 --> 11:29.601
Oh, Mrs. Mayhem. Finally.

11:29.645 --> 11:32.213
Allow me to officially welcome
you to the neighborhood.

11:32.256 --> 11:34.911
-Oh.
-[screams]

11:34.955 --> 11:36.913
Why don't we just sit?

11:36.957 --> 11:38.654
[chuckles]

11:38.698 --> 11:41.396
So tell me about these cheeses.

11:41.439 --> 11:43.050
Well, they weren't aged
when I got here

11:43.093 --> 11:46.706
-but they are now.
-[laughter]

11:46.749 --> 11:48.751
Now, on the left,
we have a hard cheese,

11:48.795 --> 11:50.405
which I really, really love.

11:50.448 --> 11:53.408
I also brought a wide selection
of Italian cheeses,

11:53.451 --> 11:55.018
my particular favorite.
I have Burrata.

11:55.062 --> 11:56.803
I have Pecorino.

11:56.846 --> 11:58.065
I have Romano.

11:58.108 --> 11:59.849
I have got some Gouda over here.

11:59.893 --> 12:01.764
Of course,
I have some Gorgonzola.

12:01.808 --> 12:03.374
Some people pronounce it
Gorgonzola

12:03.418 --> 12:05.159
but I think
they're absolutely wrong.

12:05.202 --> 12:07.248
You know what? I've never asked
if your lactose intolerant.

12:07.291 --> 12:09.119
You know, one time I did bring
a cheese platter

12:09.163 --> 12:10.338
to somebody had a stomach issue.

12:10.381 --> 12:12.122
It was a complete disaster.

12:12.166 --> 12:13.907
But of course, I have a Brie,
which is very still.

12:13.950 --> 12:15.647
Everybody loves Brie and grapes

12:15.691 --> 12:17.388
in case people
don't like cheese.

12:17.432 --> 12:19.651
And I heard you were English
so I brought a Stilton.

12:19.695 --> 12:22.916
Oh, well.
Oh, you're the cleverest.

12:22.959 --> 12:25.266
Uh-hmm. [sniffs]
Do I smell smoke?

12:25.309 --> 12:27.964
-[sniffs]
-Nope. [chuckles softly]

12:28.008 --> 12:31.751
No. That's just my smoking
hot husband.

12:33.056 --> 12:35.232
No argument there.

12:35.276 --> 12:37.495
Hey, Mr. T.
Great to see you again.

12:37.539 --> 12:39.715
You should be good.
The climate machine is done

12:39.759 --> 12:41.804
and I've dialed it
to maximum humidity.

12:41.848 --> 12:44.546
Woo!
Is it always this balmy in here?

12:46.113 --> 12:49.029
Uh, yeah.
We like a moist living room.

12:50.378 --> 12:53.381
Who says that?
No one says that.

12:53.424 --> 12:56.427
I think it feels, kind of, nice.

12:59.126 --> 13:01.389
[upbeat music playing]

13:02.564 --> 13:04.000
[groans] Come on.

13:04.044 --> 13:05.959
How long does it take
to fix a turtle leg?

13:06.002 --> 13:08.613
Well, Colby can be shy.

13:08.657 --> 13:11.051
Maybe he won't come out
of his shell.

13:11.094 --> 13:12.792
[laughs]

13:13.793 --> 13:15.098
Excuse me?

13:15.142 --> 13:16.578
Any chance you could
put him down?

13:19.886 --> 13:22.323
-How is he?
-Your turtle is fine.

13:22.366 --> 13:24.107
It's just a small leg sprain.

13:24.151 --> 13:25.195
Are you sure?

13:25.239 --> 13:27.589
He seemed pretty shell shocked.

13:27.632 --> 13:29.634
[laughs quietly]

13:29.678 --> 13:32.376
Kid, my job is hard enough.

13:33.377 --> 13:34.988
Jake, just pay the lady

13:35.031 --> 13:36.990
so we can take our turtle
and get out of here.

13:37.033 --> 13:39.166
I'm sorry
but I can't let you do that.

13:39.209 --> 13:41.168
Why not?
I thought you said he was fine.

13:41.211 --> 13:43.170
He is but in Texas,

13:43.213 --> 13:45.563
that turtle is considered
to be a rare breed,

13:45.607 --> 13:48.784
which means,
you can't keep him as a pet.

13:49.829 --> 13:52.092
I'm sorry but animal control
is on their way to pick him up.

13:56.270 --> 13:58.838
[upbeat music playing]

13:58.881 --> 14:01.014
We can't let animal control
to take our brother.

14:01.057 --> 14:03.059
Well, we could.

14:03.103 --> 14:05.105
I'm just saying
that one time Dad accidentally

14:05.148 --> 14:06.889
lost him at the mall.

14:06.933 --> 14:08.499
It didn't really seem
like an accident.

14:10.153 --> 14:11.938
We have to sneak past
that assistant

14:11.981 --> 14:13.330
and get him out of here
before they show up.

14:13.374 --> 14:15.202
Pfft. I got this.

14:15.245 --> 14:18.727
Help!
The raccoon is eating my face!

14:21.295 --> 14:23.384
The raccoon is eating my face?

14:23.427 --> 14:25.516
You know, I work dark.
Let's go!

14:27.954 --> 14:30.086
-Colby, where are you?
-COLBY: Over here.

14:32.654 --> 14:34.264
How do we unlock this thing?

14:34.308 --> 14:36.310
The locks are all controlled
by that computer over there.

14:38.747 --> 14:40.444
Looks like we'll need
a five-digit password.

14:40.488 --> 14:41.968
-WOMAN: Crazy day, huh?
-MAN: I know right?

14:42.011 --> 14:43.665
-Someone's coming. Hide.
-MAN: Oh, by the way,

14:43.708 --> 14:45.841
I talked to animal control.

14:45.885 --> 14:48.191
Not gonna work.
Not gonna work.

14:50.977 --> 14:52.979
Animal control should be here
any minute for the turtle.

14:53.022 --> 14:54.763
By this time tomorrow,
this little guy

14:54.806 --> 14:56.634
will be at the sanctuary
in Costa Rica.

14:56.678 --> 14:57.809
What?

15:00.116 --> 15:02.379
Did that turtle just...

15:05.165 --> 15:06.209
I need a day-off.

15:09.996 --> 15:11.562
COLBY: Get me out of here!

15:11.606 --> 15:13.086
I can't go to Costa Rica.

15:13.129 --> 15:16.611
All my videogames
will be in a different language.

15:16.654 --> 15:18.482
That's all you care about?

15:18.526 --> 15:20.223
Pretty much.

15:20.267 --> 15:23.183
Jake, just use your super
strength to bust the cage open.

15:23.226 --> 15:25.185
I can't. The sign says
the alarm will go off.

15:26.273 --> 15:28.188
Well, you better do
something fast. Look.

15:31.104 --> 15:33.323
We definitely have
to get him out.

15:33.367 --> 15:34.672
Do you know how much money
we will make

15:34.716 --> 15:36.196
on selling him to the circus?

is ridiculous.

The one day I didn't wear
a shirt with mesh vents.

Don't worry. It's just the A/C.

Mr. Mayhem is working on it.

15:52.864 --> 15:54.779
Okay. I tweaked the unit.

15:54.823 --> 15:56.781
This place should be cool
in no time.

15:56.825 --> 15:58.261
I can feel the breeze already.

what's going on at this house.

Oh, wait till I tell the rat.

Must be the side effects
of getting your powers.

like you better like this.

-No. In a cage.

20:45.505 --> 20:47.681
Colby, we're sorry about
what happened today.

20:47.724 --> 20:49.291
Yeah. We tried to give you
a true villain experience

20:49.335 --> 20:51.162
but it didn't go quite
as we planned.

20:51.206 --> 20:53.774
It's okay.
I appreciate you guys trying.

20:53.817 --> 20:55.602
I just have to face the reality
that we're here now.

20:55.645 --> 20:58.518
And I'll never get a chance
to be a true supervillain.

21:02.565 --> 21:04.959
You guys really messed up today.

21:05.002 --> 21:07.178
Hey! They aren't the only ones.

21:07.222 --> 21:09.224
It's about the kids right now,
Eva.

21:10.660 --> 21:12.619
I feel bad. We were supposed
to be giving him

21:12.662 --> 21:14.621
-the best day of his life.
-Yeah. I know.

21:14.664 --> 21:16.971
I wish there was something
we could do.

21:17.014 --> 21:19.016
Maybe there is.

21:20.366 --> 21:21.845
All right. Come on out.

21:23.456 --> 21:25.458
[laughing]

21:29.070 --> 21:31.290
-What do you think?
-I love it.

21:31.333 --> 21:33.292
Was I supposed to wear
underwear?

21:34.336 --> 21:35.294
I never do.

21:36.730 --> 21:38.645
And along with your fancy
new villain suit

21:38.688 --> 21:41.169
comes your official
villain name.

21:41.212 --> 21:43.737
Allow me to introduce everyone
to Flashform!

21:43.780 --> 21:46.261
[laughs]

21:46.305 --> 21:49.308
Oh, before we forget
your new suit

21:49.351 --> 21:52.136
comes with this helmet.

21:52.180 --> 21:54.095
Wow.

21:54.138 --> 21:56.445
Now, you're officially
one of us.

21:56.489 --> 21:58.882
Our supervillain family
is finally complete.

21:58.926 --> 22:02.190
[upbeat music playing]

22:02.233 --> 22:03.626
Great.
Now, let's take these things off

22:03.670 --> 22:05.454
and get back to our boring
new lives.

22:11.025 --> 22:13.201
An official supervillain.

22:13.244 --> 22:14.245
Yes!

22:19.207 --> 22:21.340
I think the helmet's stuck.

22:22.863 --> 22:24.995
I can't get it off.

22:25.039 --> 22:26.257
Mom?

22:26.301 --> 22:27.694
Dad?

22:27.737 --> 22:29.130
Randy!
