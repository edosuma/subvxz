00:57.920 --> 00:59.148
Keep the change, kid.

01:02.400 --> 01:04.709
- Good morning, Inspector.
- It is indeed, Higgins!

01:04.800 --> 01:06.995
Our special camera has made
the front pages again.

01:07.080 --> 01:09.958
"Station House Number Four is the pride
of Toronto this morning.

01:10.040 --> 01:13.635
"Detective William Murdoch,
the inventive and, blah, blah, blah,

01:13.720 --> 01:15.950
"has deployed a device
he calls 'the scrutiny camera'

01:16.040 --> 01:17.837
- "to catch a jewel thief in the act. "
- Sir?

01:17.920 --> 01:21.310
"'The remarkable camera can take
photographs at night without a flash',

01:21.400 --> 01:24.710
"said Station House Number Four's
Inspector Thomas Brackenred... "

01:24.800 --> 01:26.153
Brackenred!

01:27.720 --> 01:29.358
Get me that reporter Paddy Glynn
on the phone.

01:29.440 --> 01:31.670
I want my name spelled correctly
by the afternoon edition.

01:31.760 --> 01:34.513
I will do, sir,
but right at this moment...

01:36.120 --> 01:38.714
Someone broke in last night, sir.
They ransacked the place.

01:39.240 --> 01:42.437
- I can see that. Was anything taken?
- Not as far as we can tell.

01:43.800 --> 01:44.835
The armoury?

01:44.920 --> 01:47.229
All the guns and ammunition
have been accounted for.

01:47.640 --> 01:49.915
- Murdoch?
- Sir, he's not in yet.

01:50.000 --> 01:53.709
It's nearly half past eight.
Where is he?

01:54.000 --> 01:55.149
Oh, my...

01:56.640 --> 01:58.119
Good of you to join us, Murdoch.

01:58.200 --> 02:00.919
Please forgive my tardiness, sir,
I had to collect a telegram.

02:01.000 --> 02:03.833
As you can see, we've had
an incident that might interest you.

02:06.000 --> 02:07.911
Clearly, this was the point of entry.

02:09.680 --> 02:10.829
It's still damp.

02:11.280 --> 02:13.316
Our intruder must have been caught
in the downpour.

02:13.400 --> 02:15.709
We had heavy rains around 2:35 a.m.

02:17.560 --> 02:19.516
I happened to be awake.

02:19.600 --> 02:21.238
So he breaks into a station house,

02:21.320 --> 02:23.595
rats around causing mayhem
and doesn't take anything.

02:24.800 --> 02:26.950
- Nothing was taken?
- It doesn't seem, sir.

02:28.240 --> 02:31.152
Well, then, sir, perhaps it was simply
hooligans on a lark.

02:31.240 --> 02:32.514
Nothing more than that.

02:32.880 --> 02:35.633
Nothing more than that?
No request for finger marks

02:35.720 --> 02:38.393
or tracing of footprints
and so on, and so forth, et cetera?

02:38.480 --> 02:41.677
Well, yes, of course, sir,
but George can take care of that.

02:42.080 --> 02:44.230
And might we get you your breakfast?
Maybe a scone?

02:46.240 --> 02:48.310
Inspector, please forgive me,

02:48.400 --> 02:52.678
but I need to take the next few days off
to tend to a private matter.

02:52.760 --> 02:55.593
- You, booking off?
- Are you ill, sir?

02:55.680 --> 02:59.673
No, George, I'm fine,
but I am needed elsewhere.

03:00.080 --> 03:02.674
In fact,
I should head to the train straightaway.

03:03.120 --> 03:07.796
- Well, be back by Monday.
- Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

03:11.560 --> 03:15.235
Sir, you know, he mentioned a train? He
has a sister in a convent in Montreal.

03:15.320 --> 03:16.799
Perhaps he's going to visit her.

03:16.880 --> 03:18.711
- His sister's a nun?
- Yes, sir.

03:18.920 --> 03:20.478
I do hope she's all right.

03:20.680 --> 03:23.194
Just get this mess cleaned up, Crabtree.

03:23.600 --> 03:24.828
Yes, sir.

03:35.760 --> 03:36.795
Thank you, sir.

04:10.200 --> 04:11.918
Right this way, sir.

04:16.399 --> 04:18.356
Julia, what on earth?

04:18.560 --> 04:21.791
Your telegram alluded to something
urgent, but what has you so cautious?

04:21.880 --> 04:25.350
No one can know I've asked you here,
especially if my fears are borne out.

04:25.800 --> 04:27.791
What fears? Are you in danger?

04:27.880 --> 04:31.190
William, I believe there's a killer
on the loose in this hospital.

04:36.360 --> 04:41.514
Two days ago one of our cancer patients
died, a 12 year old named Ben Digiorno.

04:41.880 --> 04:45.031
The hospital listed cause of death
as complications of leukaemia.

04:45.320 --> 04:46.878
But you suspect otherwise?

04:47.080 --> 04:49.640
His condition was steadily improving,
then one morning he was dead.

04:49.720 --> 04:50.994
It made no sense.

04:51.080 --> 04:53.116
- Was there a post-mortem?
- No.

04:53.200 --> 04:57.034
And I couldn't very well demand one
without revealing my suspicions.

04:57.800 --> 05:00.792
The frustrating thing is Ben's body
is still in the hospital morgue

05:00.880 --> 05:03.314
and I have no basis
on which to examine it.

05:03.520 --> 05:05.875
And no one else voiced surprise
over Ben's death?

05:05.960 --> 05:07.678
No, and that was unusual.

05:07.760 --> 05:10.069
What's more, when I expressed
my concerns to Dr Falwell,

05:10.160 --> 05:11.912
he insisted
the cause of death was leukaemia

05:12.000 --> 05:13.479
and that was the end of it.
Quite out of character.

05:13.560 --> 05:14.959
Dr Falwell?

05:15.040 --> 05:17.395
He's the head of medicine
and the man who hired me.

05:17.480 --> 05:18.595
Ah-ha!

05:18.800 --> 05:21.314
You see, the hospital's in the midst
of a massive fundraising campaign

05:21.400 --> 05:23.709
run by the wife of Dr Lawrence Abbot.

05:23.800 --> 05:26.360
He's the hospital founder
and administrator.

05:26.440 --> 05:29.512
And any whiff of impropriety
during a fundraising drive...

05:29.600 --> 05:31.591
- Much less murder.
- Hmm.

05:32.120 --> 05:34.793
So why not simply go
to the Buffalo police?

05:35.480 --> 05:39.234
The Abbots have influence and I only
have suspicions and no hard evidence.

05:40.200 --> 05:42.839
Perhaps it was simply leukaemia
that killed Ben?

05:43.000 --> 05:44.797
I don't think it was.

05:45.800 --> 05:47.791
I guess I'm just asking you to trust me.

05:47.880 --> 05:50.838
And I do, Julia. After all, I am here.

05:51.320 --> 05:53.754
But there is also
the issue of my jurisdiction.

05:53.840 --> 05:57.071
Yes, that's why I'll introduce you
as a wealthy patron from Toronto,

05:57.160 --> 05:59.355
interested in donating money
to the hospital.

06:00.120 --> 06:02.953
- Wealthy? But I...
- You look fine.

06:04.720 --> 06:06.119
William, I need your help.

06:08.120 --> 06:09.951
Then how can I say no?

06:11.760 --> 06:14.718
I'm to join a patrons' tour
in 15 minutes.

06:14.920 --> 06:17.992
Dr Falwell and the Abbots
will be there and so will you.

06:18.280 --> 06:19.554
Very good.

06:20.160 --> 06:24.551
Julia, I meant to say
how good it is to see you.

06:24.960 --> 06:29.556
Oh, and I you. I mean, yes, William,
it's so wonderful to see you.

06:29.640 --> 06:31.039
You've been well?

06:31.120 --> 06:32.678
- Yes.
- Myself as well.

06:32.760 --> 06:35.194
- And Buffalo is even...
- You're enjoying Buffalo?

06:35.280 --> 06:37.555
Oh... Am I enjoying it?

06:37.680 --> 06:40.752
Yes, even better than expected, yes.

06:40.840 --> 06:44.469
- Working with the living instead of...
- Well, yes, instead of...

06:45.280 --> 06:48.078
Well, I'm truly delighted for you.

06:49.400 --> 06:51.470
- Yes.
- Yes.

07:02.720 --> 07:03.994
Inspector?

07:04.320 --> 07:06.231
Bugger polished off my best whisky.

07:06.600 --> 07:09.672
A man saves up for that.
He makes certain sacrifices.

07:09.800 --> 07:13.839
My sympathies indeed, sir.
That reporter Paddy Glynn is here.

07:13.920 --> 07:16.992
He wanted to interview Detective Murdoch
about the scrutiny camera.

07:17.080 --> 07:19.355
Marvellous, with our house in pieces.

07:19.840 --> 07:21.159
- Send him in.
- Will do.

07:21.240 --> 07:23.117
Actually, sir, here he is now.

07:23.200 --> 07:24.792
Thank you, Constable Crabtree.

07:24.880 --> 07:27.519
Inspector, I see
there was some mischief last night?

07:27.600 --> 07:29.636
It's Brackenreid, Glynn, not Brackenred.

07:29.720 --> 07:32.518
Oh, that's the typesetters, Inspector.
Dunces, all.

07:32.600 --> 07:35.956
- Now, where's Detective Murdoch?
- On a case, can't be reached.

07:36.040 --> 07:38.713
Oh, dash it, now I have nothing
for the morning edition.

07:39.360 --> 07:41.430
Except, perhaps, this break-in.

07:42.160 --> 07:43.639
You'll not be writing about that, son.

07:43.720 --> 07:45.631
Why not?
Your station house is a crime scene.

07:45.720 --> 07:47.119
That's ironic. The public will love it.

07:48.120 --> 07:49.838
Crime and underwear reporters like you

07:49.920 --> 07:52.309
depend upon the likes of me
for inside information.

07:52.400 --> 07:54.311
You wouldn't want that to dry up now,
would you?

07:54.400 --> 07:56.311
May I remind you of the power
of the press, Inspector?

07:57.280 --> 07:58.429
How's this for a headline?

07:58.520 --> 08:00.988
"Bungling Brackenreid
Baffled by Break-in. "

08:03.440 --> 08:05.192
You're living dangerously, Glynn.

08:06.240 --> 08:07.753
Here's what I'll do for you.

08:07.840 --> 08:10.354
I'll hold off on Bungling Brackenreid
for now.

08:10.440 --> 08:13.955
Solve this break-in
and I'll make you out the hero instead.

08:14.960 --> 08:17.679
"Intrepid Inspector Ensnares
Irritating Intruder. "

08:18.360 --> 08:19.588
And what do you get?

08:19.680 --> 08:22.148
The exclusive scoop on any big cases
that come into the station.

08:23.680 --> 08:25.477
- Deal.
- Excellent.

08:25.560 --> 08:28.199
And if you get broken into again,
please give me a suspect.

08:28.280 --> 08:30.589
It's been a pleasure, Inspector.

08:34.080 --> 08:35.354
Crabtree!

08:36.799 --> 08:37.835
Sir?

08:38.480 --> 08:40.152
I've got a little project for you.

08:41.600 --> 08:43.794
If you'll keep following me,
ladies and gentlemen,

08:43.880 --> 08:45.438
we'll get back to the ward
a little later

08:45.520 --> 08:48.114
so you can meet
more of our little angels.

08:49.320 --> 08:52.232
Why, Dr Ogden, there you are at last.

08:52.800 --> 08:56.839
Head of paediatric surgery,
everyone, Dr Julia Ogden.

08:57.680 --> 09:00.319
May I introduce Mr Willard Prenfrew?

09:00.400 --> 09:02.391
An Ogden family friend from Toronto.

09:02.480 --> 09:05.392
Mr Prenfrew is a generous contributor
to medical sciences.

09:06.520 --> 09:09.671
Willard, this is our head of medicine,
Dr Martin Falwell.

09:09.760 --> 09:11.478
Our chief administrator,
Dr Lawrence Abbot

09:11.560 --> 09:14.438
and his wife Laeticia,
the head of our hospital foundation.

09:14.800 --> 09:16.916
So glad you could make it, Mr Prenfrew.

09:17.000 --> 09:18.274
It's a pleasure to meet you all.

09:18.360 --> 09:21.193
A warm welcome to you on behalf
of the Children's Hospital of Buffalo.

09:21.280 --> 09:23.032
Well, shall we continue... Oh!

09:23.520 --> 09:25.988
Everyone, this is Dr Darcy Garland,

09:26.080 --> 09:28.799
one of our dedicated
and caring physicians

09:28.880 --> 09:31.235
who's treating little...

09:31.800 --> 09:33.392
- Victoria.
- Oh.

09:33.480 --> 09:36.597
And what a beautiful little lady she is,
aren't you, dear?

09:36.680 --> 09:39.831
Dr Garland, what is Victoria's
particular affliction?

09:40.440 --> 09:43.079
She has an idiopathic inflammation
of the pericardium.

09:45.840 --> 09:47.512
An ailment of the heart.

09:47.680 --> 09:49.591
Mmm. And how are you treating her?

09:50.440 --> 09:53.398
She's been cut to six ounces
between the left scapular and the spine.

09:53.480 --> 09:56.358
Grain of Calomel and Dover's powder
are administered every four hours.

09:56.840 --> 09:58.592
Wonderful. So she's getting better?

09:58.800 --> 10:00.836
She's under observation.

10:00.920 --> 10:02.273
Splendid, Dr Garland.

10:02.520 --> 10:05.398
Come, Victoria,
why don't we get something to eat?

10:05.680 --> 10:06.954
Well, you are in for a treat.

10:07.040 --> 10:09.713
I know you're very excited
to see the invalid ward.

10:13.520 --> 10:15.112
Willard Prenfrew?

10:15.200 --> 10:18.112
I don't know, William, I needed a name.

10:18.840 --> 10:20.319
Now, I must rejoin the tour.

10:20.400 --> 10:22.356
Yes. Where was Ben's area, then?

10:22.680 --> 10:26.992
The ward is just through those doors.
Ben had the second bed on the right.

10:27.080 --> 10:30.629
- And if anyone asks after me?
- I'll make something up.

11:18.000 --> 11:19.069
What are you doing?

11:22.280 --> 11:23.429
And you are?

11:24.040 --> 11:25.393
That was Ben's bed.

11:26.400 --> 11:28.118
You shouldn't be poking around it.

11:30.040 --> 11:32.349
- Did you know Ben?
- For a little while.

11:32.920 --> 11:34.911
That's as long as you know anybody here.

11:35.840 --> 11:37.353
I didn't like him.

11:39.040 --> 11:40.029
Why is that?

11:40.120 --> 11:42.350
ome people
you just don't like on sight.

12:09.120 --> 12:10.439
There you are.

12:10.600 --> 12:12.795
I hope my absence
didn't raise any eyebrows.

12:12.880 --> 12:16.839
- I think it's fine. What's this?
- It's Ben's notepad.

12:17.400 --> 12:21.473
It's curious. There's a skip in the
pages here which denotes a missing page.

12:21.840 --> 12:22.875
- Hmm.
- Uh?

12:24.080 --> 12:27.197
- Oh, looks like an M and here a Y.
- Possibly.

12:28.440 --> 12:30.715
- Do you have a pencil sharpener?
- Of course.

12:33.960 --> 12:35.712
I hope you don't mind.

12:54.000 --> 12:55.479
Looks like "zoo".

12:56.360 --> 12:58.669
And there a G, D, N...

12:59.760 --> 13:01.910
- "Ogden. "
- I hope not.

13:03.320 --> 13:05.880
Golden? "My golden zoo?"

13:06.680 --> 13:08.033
It's gibberish.

13:09.000 --> 13:10.319
I do love a puzzle.

13:11.640 --> 13:14.438
Alas, I fear this puzzle
may be of no consequence.

13:15.080 --> 13:17.878
I had somewhat of a run-in
with one of Ben's ward-mates.

13:17.960 --> 13:20.713
Oh, that must be Ezra, the ward bully.

13:21.520 --> 13:22.714
He seemed a sullen lad.

13:22.800 --> 13:25.473
His hostility toward Ben gave me pause.

13:25.960 --> 13:28.474
Not all of the children here
come to accept their condition.

13:28.560 --> 13:31.199
Like Ezra, they're angry
and it never leaves them.

13:31.280 --> 13:33.316
You mentioned
Ben's condition was improving.

13:33.400 --> 13:35.960
Is it possible
Ezra resented him for this?

13:36.760 --> 13:38.398
Enough to kill him?

13:39.680 --> 13:41.716
Julia, I fear that without a post-mortem

13:41.800 --> 13:43.836
to establish
the reason for Ben's death...

13:43.920 --> 13:47.276
Dr Falwell would never allow it,
nor would Dr Abbot,

13:47.360 --> 13:49.112
especially if one of them is involved.

13:51.280 --> 13:52.872
Perhaps, in this case,
it would be better

13:52.960 --> 13:55.838
to ask for forgiveness later
than permission now.

14:02.320 --> 14:04.993
I'm telling you, I have ever seen
Detective Murdoch so out of sorts.

14:05.080 --> 14:07.548
That's understandable
with his sister taking ill.

14:07.800 --> 14:10.519
Well, it's not just that.
It's been going on for months now.

14:10.760 --> 14:14.833
He's impatient, short-tempered,
butting heads with Dr Francis.

14:15.280 --> 14:18.511
I think he's suffering
some sort of general malaise.

14:19.240 --> 14:20.673
- Malaise?
- Yes.

14:20.760 --> 14:23.593
It's Italian for "gloomy", I believe.

14:24.040 --> 14:27.191
I think he's lovesick for Dr Ogden,
George. It's plain and simple.

14:28.200 --> 14:29.428
I think we're all done here, George.

14:29.520 --> 14:30.839
All right, let's test it.

14:42.480 --> 14:45.199
- What is it?
- I don't know.

14:45.280 --> 14:47.316
I don't like being watched, I suppose.

14:47.800 --> 14:49.597
That's the whole idea, George.

14:49.680 --> 14:51.318
I mean, one day the entire city

14:51.400 --> 14:53.231
could be under the scrutiny
of cameras like this,

14:53.320 --> 14:55.038
watching our every move
and keeping us safe.

14:55.120 --> 14:56.872
Crime will be a thing of the past.

14:57.800 --> 14:59.950
Well, I wouldn't want to
be a copper in the future then!

15:00.040 --> 15:04.192
You'd have nothing to do except drink
tea and exude intestinal vapours.

15:09.040 --> 15:11.554
There's evidence of Mees' lines
on his fingernails,

15:12.440 --> 15:14.237
signs of corneal necrosis,

15:14.320 --> 15:16.197
neither of which
are symptoms of leukaemia.

15:16.360 --> 15:17.713
Interesting.

15:19.280 --> 15:22.078
The liver's enlarged.
The spleen as well.

15:23.240 --> 15:24.832
Leukaemia could account for that.

15:25.920 --> 15:29.390
But I'll need blood cells for testing
and I'll need to open him up, William.

15:30.880 --> 15:33.030
Stop what you're doing this instant!

15:35.920 --> 15:39.879
- Dr Falwell!
- I demand an explanation, Dr Ogden.

15:39.960 --> 15:43.953
As I told you, I believe Ben Digiorno
died under suspicious circumstances.

15:44.120 --> 15:46.190
What is Mr Prenfrew doing here?

15:46.680 --> 15:49.638
I'm Detective William Murdoch
of the Toronto Constabulary.

15:49.760 --> 15:53.514
Toronto? You have no jurisdiction
here and there has been no crime.

15:54.000 --> 15:56.036
The cancer killed Ben, Doctor.

15:56.480 --> 16:00.678
What you are doing here is completely
unwarranted and beyond insubordination.

16:00.760 --> 16:03.558
- I realise that...
- No, I don't think you do.

16:04.000 --> 16:07.151
This seriously jeopardises your position
at this hospital.

16:08.920 --> 16:13.118
Dr Falwell, I have worked with Dr Ogden
extensively in Toronto

16:13.360 --> 16:16.591
and learned to take her speculation
as seriously as any fact.

16:17.200 --> 16:19.111
I urge you
to appreciate the consequences

16:19.200 --> 16:21.919
should I discover Ben Digiorno's death
was, in fact, murder.

16:22.160 --> 16:24.549
The consequences? To me?

16:24.760 --> 16:29.276
Interfering in a murder investigation is
obstruction of justice in any country.

16:29.360 --> 16:33.148
This is not obstruction of justice.
There was no foul play here.

16:33.240 --> 16:35.310
I want both of you out of here now.

16:35.400 --> 16:37.868
And, Dr Ogden, I will deal with you
in the morning.

16:49.440 --> 16:52.159
Unless I miss my guess, lads,
we had a visitor last night.

16:52.240 --> 16:53.673
All right!

16:54.560 --> 16:55.993
- Well done, sir.
- Hey!

16:56.080 --> 16:58.913
Although there is a conspicuous lack
of ransacking.

16:59.040 --> 17:01.076
He was here, Crabtree.
I don't care how he got in.

17:01.160 --> 17:03.993
Let's get that photograph developed
and see what we've got.

17:07.319 --> 17:08.958
Do you know what I'm looking at,
William?

17:10.280 --> 17:11.679
Not offhand, no.

17:13.040 --> 17:15.838
My career in Buffalo
coming to a screeching halt

17:15.920 --> 17:17.512
if these samples are normal.

17:19.119 --> 17:23.318
Interesting.
High levels of heroin and arsenic.

17:25.200 --> 17:27.349
The heroin's expected,
it's a painkiller,

17:27.440 --> 17:28.953
but the arsenic shouldn't be there.

17:29.040 --> 17:30.632
Young Ben was poisoned then?

17:31.800 --> 17:35.190
Arsenic poisoning would account for the
Mees' lines and the corneal necrosis.

17:35.920 --> 17:36.955
Murder.

17:38.280 --> 17:40.555
I wonder
how Dr Falwell will react to that.

17:42.200 --> 17:44.714
Ah, good. I'll see you
in my office immediately, Dr Ogden.

17:44.800 --> 17:46.995
I secured blood samples
from Ben Digiorno's body.

17:47.080 --> 17:48.991
You what? I thought I told you...

17:49.080 --> 17:51.196
There were high levels
of arsenic in his system.

17:51.280 --> 17:52.633
The boy was poisoned, sir.

17:54.920 --> 17:57.878
Yes, he was. By me.

17:59.400 --> 18:01.675
I administered arsenic trioxide to Ben.

18:02.200 --> 18:03.269
It's a radical new technique

18:03.360 --> 18:05.999
using chemical therapy
to fight cancerous cells.

18:06.240 --> 18:08.993
I didn't realise that chemical therapy
used arsenic.

18:09.080 --> 18:10.593
That's because it's new.

18:10.880 --> 18:13.110
Dr Park at the University of Buffalo

18:13.200 --> 18:15.475
found that arsenic lowers
the white blood cell count.

18:15.560 --> 18:17.790
I reasoned
it might battle Ben's leukaemia.

18:18.800 --> 18:20.199
At the risk of killing the boy?

18:20.280 --> 18:23.556
With any advanced cancer,
risk is a relative term.

18:23.640 --> 18:26.916
Ben was at a late stage, the treatments
were showing positive results.

18:27.000 --> 18:29.036
I still don't understand
why he went so suddenly.

18:29.120 --> 18:30.109
Did you even consider

18:30.200 --> 18:32.111
that the arsenic-heroin interaction
could be fatal?

18:32.200 --> 18:35.237
Of course. That's why I kept
the heroin to such a low dosage.

18:35.320 --> 18:36.469
A low dosage?

18:37.160 --> 18:38.957
We found high concentrations
in his blood.

18:39.040 --> 18:41.076
What? That can't be.

18:41.160 --> 18:42.832
Let me see those samples.

18:46.400 --> 18:48.152
Higgins, spread out.

18:50.720 --> 18:54.952
Gentlemen, we are about to launch
a new era in crime-fighting techniques.

18:55.040 --> 18:56.029
Well, sir, technically,

18:56.120 --> 18:58.554
Detective Murdoch
has already launched the...

19:02.440 --> 19:03.668
Right then.

19:06.240 --> 19:07.753
Oh, my socks!

19:10.160 --> 19:12.435
A mouse? A bloody mouse?

19:12.880 --> 19:14.233
Hang on, sir, hang on.

19:15.960 --> 19:18.235
There's somebody there.

19:18.320 --> 19:19.594
That's our man.

19:19.680 --> 19:22.638
Now what's so interesting about
Murdoch's filing cabinet, sunshine?

19:37.680 --> 19:39.830
- May I help you, ma'am?
- No.

19:41.280 --> 19:43.794
I'm the mother,
come to fetch my boy's clothes,

19:43.880 --> 19:45.632
but they've gone and thrown them out,
they said.

19:45.720 --> 19:47.676
Perfect good condition!

19:48.200 --> 19:50.430
Mrs Digiorno,
may I offer my condolences?

19:50.520 --> 19:52.192
Save it, I've got eight others.

19:53.040 --> 19:55.235
And they'll be needing
something to wear too.

19:56.640 --> 19:59.200
Ben, he was one of the better ones.

19:59.320 --> 20:02.869
Last thing he said to me was,
"Our money troubles will soon be over. "

20:04.640 --> 20:06.517
One less mouth to feed.

20:08.200 --> 20:11.829
Ben's stuffed toy, a little bunny
rabbit, where's that got to?

20:14.120 --> 20:17.317
- One of the others could have used it.
- I'll keep an eye out for it.

20:18.800 --> 20:20.153
Sure you will.

20:25.120 --> 20:27.634
Dr Falwell and I are certain, William,

20:27.800 --> 20:29.995
- Ben was overdosed with heroin.
- Oh?

20:30.080 --> 20:32.753
Dr Falwell is in shock.
I'm sure he had nothing to do with this.

20:32.840 --> 20:33.989
Hmm.

20:34.080 --> 20:36.355
Who could have administered
the fatal dose then?

20:36.440 --> 20:38.112
We checked Ben's charts.

20:38.200 --> 20:40.270
Nurse Rowan would have given
Ben most of his shots

20:40.360 --> 20:43.079
but it seems she hasn't reported
to work for a few days.

20:43.160 --> 20:44.229
Oh?

20:45.720 --> 20:47.073
We'll need an address then.

20:56.280 --> 20:57.554
Miss Rowan?

21:00.160 --> 21:01.309
Hello?

21:03.800 --> 21:05.552
Did you know her well?

21:06.000 --> 21:08.594
Only what one gleans
from a working relationship.

21:11.040 --> 21:12.359
Yes.

21:13.120 --> 21:16.157
I haven't really had time
to get to know anyone here,

21:16.640 --> 21:18.437
outside of the hospital.

21:19.000 --> 21:22.151
- I'm sure that will change.
- Yes.

21:25.160 --> 21:27.594
William, I've been...

21:34.760 --> 21:38.958
Turn around slowly
and put your hands up in the air.

21:43.440 --> 21:46.557
- Detective Murdoch?
- Detective Callahan?

21:47.400 --> 21:49.038
What the hell are you doing in Buffalo,
Murdoch?

21:49.800 --> 21:53.031
I came to find Miss Effie Rowan.
She's a nurse at the hospital.

21:53.120 --> 21:55.759
Yes, she washed ashore
at Cayuga Creek this morning.

21:55.840 --> 21:58.991
I came here looking for a suicide note
and I find you instead.

21:59.080 --> 22:00.149
You and...

22:01.040 --> 22:04.157
Dr Julia Ogden
of the Children's Hospital of Buffalo,

22:04.240 --> 22:06.674
Detective Patrick Callahan
of the Buffalo Police.

22:07.080 --> 22:09.913
- Hi.
- Yes, hi.

22:11.560 --> 22:13.312
The truth is, we were hoping Miss Rowan

22:13.400 --> 22:15.868
could shed some light
on a suspicious death at the hospital.

22:16.000 --> 22:19.037
A suspicious death?
Let's start from the beginning.

22:25.440 --> 22:26.475
Higgins!

22:28.360 --> 22:30.316
- This folder has been misfiled.
- So?

22:30.400 --> 22:34.393
So Detective Murdoch keeps
absolutely perfect filing... fidelity.

22:37.080 --> 22:39.469
That's the jewellery store
robbery case, George.

22:40.720 --> 22:43.234
Higgins, I believe our intruder
was after this folder.

22:43.480 --> 22:45.232
And why wasn't it taken?

22:45.320 --> 22:47.993
The jewellery store case is over and
done with. The thief's in jail.

22:48.600 --> 22:51.751
So why was our visitor interested
in the file but not enough to pinch it?

22:52.040 --> 22:53.758
Sir, I helped Detective Murdoch
with this file.

22:53.840 --> 22:55.398
I'm quite sure nothing was taken.

22:55.480 --> 22:56.595
I do agree with you, though.

22:56.680 --> 22:59.990
It seems odd to break into
a police station just to read the thing.

23:00.080 --> 23:01.115
Sir!

23:04.160 --> 23:06.355
What's wrong with this picture?

23:07.920 --> 23:09.990
So the Digiorno boy dies
of a heroin overdose

23:10.080 --> 23:12.514
and the nurse that might have done it
is also dead.

23:13.880 --> 23:16.599
- You have my attention.
- But you suspect suicide?

23:17.120 --> 23:18.712
Well, I'm not so sure any more.

23:20.120 --> 23:23.271
Either way, we'll need a post-mortem
on Nurse Rowan right away.

23:23.680 --> 23:26.956
- You'll need?
- By "we", I mean you and I.

23:27.360 --> 23:28.918
You're not here officially, Murdoch.

23:29.200 --> 23:32.670
A lot of noses can get bent about that
and I'm not big on desk duty.

23:36.560 --> 23:39.438
But you did help me with the
Baby Emerson abduction in Toronto

23:39.520 --> 23:42.034
so I owe you one,
just as long as I get the collar.

23:43.120 --> 23:44.189
The collar?

23:44.880 --> 23:46.108
Yes, of course.

23:46.200 --> 23:49.192
The coroner has scheduled the
post-mortem on Miss Rowan for 2:00 p.m.

23:49.280 --> 23:51.271
I'll let him know
that you'll be there, Doctor.

23:51.360 --> 23:52.634
Then I'd best be on my way.

23:52.760 --> 23:54.352
- Right.
- Gentlemen.

23:56.880 --> 23:58.472
Used to be a pathologist, huh?

23:58.560 --> 24:00.391
Oh, yes, indispensable to my work.

24:01.200 --> 24:02.394
Uh-huh.

24:02.840 --> 24:05.434
- Well, let's turn this joint over.
- Yes.

24:13.760 --> 24:15.318
What am I supposed
to be seeing here, Crabtree?

24:15.400 --> 24:18.870
This is the original photograph
but the background is not as clear

24:18.960 --> 24:20.598
as it is in the newspaper reprint,

24:20.680 --> 24:23.319
- which makes no sense, as you know, sir.
- Right.

24:23.400 --> 24:26.790
A reprint of a photograph can't be
clearer than the photograph itself.

24:29.400 --> 24:32.870
Why can't you see this man's face
in the original?

24:33.840 --> 24:35.796
Sir, I think this original
has been altered.

24:36.560 --> 24:39.472
Bloody hell. Are you telling me
this is not the original original?

24:39.560 --> 24:42.393
Yes, sir. And I fear the negative
has been altered as well.

24:43.520 --> 24:45.351
Our intruder stole
the original photograph

24:45.440 --> 24:47.476
and the negative when he broke
in the first time,

24:47.880 --> 24:50.110
and then replaced them
with altered versions the second time,

24:50.200 --> 24:52.794
when Murdoch's scrutiny camera
caught him in the act.

24:52.880 --> 24:55.440
I think so, sir. I just... I...
I can't imagine why.

24:55.520 --> 24:57.511
It's a fair bet the passer-by
in the photo

24:57.600 --> 24:59.158
and the intruder are one and the same.

24:59.240 --> 25:02.437
And no one goes to these lengths
unless they're guilty of something.

25:02.520 --> 25:04.476
<i>It's The Tell-Tale Heart, sir.</i>

25:04.560 --> 25:06.630
- The what?
- The Edgar Allan Poe story.

25:06.720 --> 25:09.154
A killer buries his victim's heart
beneath the floorboards

25:09.240 --> 25:11.276
but then he begins to hear it beating

25:11.360 --> 25:14.989
and it grows louder and louder
and louder and then...

25:16.200 --> 25:17.792
Well, then I stopped reading,
I was terrified.

25:17.880 --> 25:19.632
But, sir,
I think this is very much like that.

25:19.720 --> 25:21.790
- Our intruder has a guilty conscience?
- Yes. Exactly.

25:21.880 --> 25:22.949
You might have just said that.

25:23.040 --> 25:24.837
Oh well, sir, you know,
I get carried away sometimes.

25:24.960 --> 25:26.598
I do like
this guilty conscience bit, though.

25:26.680 --> 25:28.750
I'm going to work that
into my murder mystery.

25:28.840 --> 25:30.273
Put that away.

25:31.400 --> 25:33.755
I want a list of all the crimes
committed in the vicinity

25:33.840 --> 25:34.875
of the jewellery store robbery

25:34.960 --> 25:37.155
that occurred around the same time.
Anything at all.

25:37.680 --> 25:38.749
Sir.

25:40.960 --> 25:44.714
Let's hope that Nurse Rowan's locker
is more enlightening than her apartment.

25:46.000 --> 25:47.399
This doesn't look good.

25:47.480 --> 25:51.029
- That's the Abbots and Dr Falwell.
- Detectives.

25:51.640 --> 25:53.039
Tell me it's not true.

25:53.120 --> 25:54.997
An investigation has been launched
into Nurse Rowan's death

25:55.080 --> 25:56.479
and the Digiorno boy's?

25:56.560 --> 25:58.312
It is, as a matter of fact.

25:58.400 --> 26:00.550
And we think the two cases are related.

26:01.160 --> 26:03.594
Are you suggesting one of our staff
might be culpable?

26:03.680 --> 26:06.797
- We made no such suggestion.
- But you just did.

26:06.880 --> 26:08.632
How dare you
talk to my husband like that?

26:08.720 --> 26:10.950
My wife is in the midst
of a crucial fundraising drive.

26:11.040 --> 26:13.031
We can't have these incidents
all over the papers.

26:13.120 --> 26:16.157
- Yes, that would be a shame.
- Detective Callahan,

26:16.240 --> 26:20.279
any injury to this hospital's reputation
will be swiftly answered by my lawyers.

26:20.480 --> 26:24.155
And you, Detective Murdoch,
deceit from the beginning.

26:24.840 --> 26:26.239
And from a Canadian.

26:29.360 --> 26:31.954
I shouldn't have told them.
I'll see if I can calm them down.

26:33.280 --> 26:36.033
Detectives, Nurse Rowan is dead?

26:36.120 --> 26:37.633
I'm afraid so, Dr Garland.

26:38.080 --> 26:40.196
Did you know
Nurse Rowan well, Dr Garland?

26:40.280 --> 26:44.159
Me? I've often worked with her.
She was a conscientious, caring nurse.

26:44.920 --> 26:47.036
Had her behaviour
changed at all recently?

26:48.400 --> 26:52.279
She seemed more quiet of late, troubled,
you might say, but I didn't pry.

26:52.720 --> 26:54.676
Detective Callahan,
what are all these questions?

26:55.240 --> 26:56.514
Just being thorough.

26:56.600 --> 26:59.034
And why is a Canadian policeman
involved in the affair?

26:59.120 --> 27:00.758
I'm here at Dr Ogden's request.

27:01.760 --> 27:04.558
Oh, you're an acquaintance of hers?

27:06.960 --> 27:09.872
Well, I have work.
I'll leave you both to it.

27:09.960 --> 27:11.951
Such a terrible business.

27:15.440 --> 27:17.510
What is your read
on that Garland fellow?

27:17.600 --> 27:20.319
Hard to tell, he seemed very careful.

27:28.760 --> 27:32.070
A letter from Nurse Rowan
to persons unknown.

27:32.880 --> 27:35.440
"My darling, I am enfeebled
with no hope of cure.

27:35.520 --> 27:39.274
"Please tell me what to do to bring you
back to me, to hold you to... "

27:39.560 --> 27:41.118
I'm not saying that.

27:42.880 --> 27:45.314
- It's a perfectly acceptable word.
- I have my principles.

27:47.320 --> 27:48.799
Very well.

27:48.880 --> 27:52.236
"To hold you to my bosom once more

27:52.320 --> 27:53.878
"near our China roses. "

27:53.960 --> 27:55.029
William?

27:55.720 --> 27:57.870
Ah, Doctor, have you news
from the post-mortem?

27:57.960 --> 28:00.349
Indeed, Nurse Rowan didn't drown.

28:00.760 --> 28:03.638
The coroner found that she died
of an injected overdose of heroin.

28:03.720 --> 28:06.314
A needle went through her uniform
into her mid-back.

28:06.400 --> 28:08.755
An unlikely place to inject oneself?

28:08.840 --> 28:10.796
Precisely. She was murdered.

28:11.080 --> 28:14.117
Possibly by a man
eager to shed himself of her.

28:14.320 --> 28:18.791
With easy access to a supply of heroin,
like the doctors in this joint.

28:18.920 --> 28:22.629
I think we can assume whoever killed
Nurse Rowan also killed Ben Digiorno.

28:22.720 --> 28:23.994
Nurse Rowan had her suspicions

28:24.080 --> 28:26.753
when the boy died
and she confronted the killer.

28:26.840 --> 28:29.035
Except that Miss Rowan was killed
before Ben died.

28:29.600 --> 28:30.874
- Before?
- Two days before.

28:30.960 --> 28:32.757
The post-mortem confirms it.

28:33.840 --> 28:36.400
- She mentions China roses.
- So?

28:36.560 --> 28:39.870
We found rose thorns
embedded in Miss Rowan's skin.

28:40.960 --> 28:44.430
If I'm not mistaken, there are
China roses in the hospital garden.

28:44.960 --> 28:48.316
Sir, I spoke with Detective Slorek
at Station Five.

28:48.560 --> 28:51.836
- He says on the morning of April 23...
- St George's Day.

28:52.720 --> 28:53.914
Congratulations.

28:54.000 --> 28:56.753
Also the day of the last
jewellery store robbery,

28:56.840 --> 28:59.513
he investigated the murder of
a young girl on Shooter Street.

28:59.600 --> 29:01.272
Three blocks down
from the jewellery store.

29:01.360 --> 29:04.079
All the suspects
that Slorek spoke to had alibis,

29:04.160 --> 29:06.594
including the prime suspect,
a neighbour of the victim,

29:06.680 --> 29:08.671
one John McLeod.

29:09.040 --> 29:10.678
He claims he was in Hamilton
at the time.

29:10.760 --> 29:13.832
- What's his story?
- He was a photographer.

29:15.400 --> 29:16.628
Why are you showing me this, Crabtree?

29:16.720 --> 29:19.678
Sir, have a close look
at the young girl's eyes and hands.

29:22.360 --> 29:25.477
- Oh, sweet Jesus, she's dead!
- It's a living dead photograph, sir.

29:25.560 --> 29:26.549
After a death in the family,

29:26.640 --> 29:29.791
the dearly departed is dressed
and posed for a photo.

29:29.880 --> 29:32.394
But, sir,
the eyes are added in after the fact,

29:32.480 --> 29:34.118
during the printing
and developing process.

29:34.200 --> 29:35.189
The same kind of trickery

29:35.280 --> 29:37.396
that was used to alter
the original scrutiny camera photo.

29:37.480 --> 29:39.152
If anybody could have
altered that negative,

29:39.240 --> 29:40.673
it's this chap John McLeod.

29:40.760 --> 29:42.796
Good work, Crabtree.
Bring the ghoul in.

29:42.880 --> 29:44.029
Sir, will do.

29:45.520 --> 29:47.954
So it's likely
Nurse Rowan and her paramour

29:48.040 --> 29:50.474
had their trysts here
under the cover of darkness.

29:50.800 --> 29:54.839
- If so, someone may have seen them.
- China roses, no question.

29:55.200 --> 29:56.713
Well, Murdoch...

29:57.760 --> 29:58.988
Look here, Detective.

29:59.400 --> 30:02.198
- Some tracks.
- A wheelchair, perhaps?

30:03.840 --> 30:05.239
Yes.

30:13.400 --> 30:16.472
Look here. A piece of cotton.

30:17.760 --> 30:20.194
Nurse Rowan's uniform
was torn in places.

30:20.280 --> 30:23.556
The coroner and I assumed it had snagged
on some rocks under the water.

30:23.640 --> 30:26.757
I'll take this to the coroner
and see if it matches the uniform.

30:26.880 --> 30:29.758
If it does, this may be
where Nurse Rowan was killed.

31:04.800 --> 31:05.949
Ezra?

31:07.200 --> 31:09.270
Were you watching us from the window?

31:09.800 --> 31:11.916
I was having trouble breathing.

31:12.360 --> 31:14.032
It helps to stand.

31:15.040 --> 31:16.758
Would you like Dr Ogden
to give you something?

31:16.840 --> 31:18.068
No.

31:18.560 --> 31:20.232
I'm feeling better.

31:31.840 --> 31:33.717
Ben Digiorno's stuffed rabbit.

31:34.480 --> 31:36.391
This must be
what his mother was looking for.

31:36.720 --> 31:38.199
Ezra...

31:38.920 --> 31:40.433
Why do you have Ben's toy?

31:41.280 --> 31:43.475
It was no good to him after he was dead.

31:43.760 --> 31:46.228
Was the toy torn like this
when you found it, Ezra?

31:46.320 --> 31:47.594
Yes.

31:52.880 --> 31:54.711
- All ready, sir?
- Almost.

31:54.960 --> 31:58.236
Sir, I've been thinking, McLeod
may have paid off his alibi witness

31:58.320 --> 32:00.993
to say that he was in Hamilton
when he was actually here in Toronto.

32:01.080 --> 32:03.878
Of course he paid him.
Wouldn't you to avoid the hangman?

32:03.960 --> 32:05.951
McLeod is the passer-by
in the jewellery store picture,

32:06.040 --> 32:07.268
fleeing the scene of the murder.

32:07.360 --> 32:09.794
He's also the man in Murdoch's office
on the scrutiny camera photo.

32:09.880 --> 32:12.235
It's not for dead certain,
but we both know it's true.

32:12.320 --> 32:15.392
- Hmm.
- Right then, let me take a crack at him.

32:15.480 --> 32:17.357
Sir, I was wondering, might I?

32:18.120 --> 32:21.396
- You? All respect, Crabtree, but...
- Sir, I have an idea.

32:22.000 --> 32:24.468
I think I can get McLeod
to confess to killing that girl.

32:24.840 --> 32:25.955
- Is that a fact?
- Yes, sir.

32:26.040 --> 32:29.271
There's just a few things I need
to prepare before I speak with him.

32:30.320 --> 32:32.880
- I'll be in my office.
- Thank you, sir.

32:49.240 --> 32:52.232
Well, you're just as proficient
at the photography

32:52.320 --> 32:54.914
as Detective Murdoch, George.
Maybe even more so.

32:55.000 --> 32:58.310
Firstly, Higgins, it's not "the"
photography, it's just photography.

32:59.080 --> 33:00.479
Secondly...

33:03.600 --> 33:05.318
You're not wrong.

33:06.240 --> 33:09.710
Right, we know that Nurse Rowan
was murdered first,

33:09.800 --> 33:13.110
injected with a lethal dose of heroin,
likely in the hospital garden.

33:13.200 --> 33:14.315
Correct.

33:14.400 --> 33:16.311
And there's a significant probability

33:16.400 --> 33:18.630
that the killer is the lover
that jilted her.

33:19.240 --> 33:20.992
Most likely a doctor on staff.

33:21.080 --> 33:24.231
And having murdered Nurse Rowan,
the killer needed a means

33:24.320 --> 33:26.470
to remove her body from the garden

33:26.560 --> 33:28.710
without raising suspicions
should they be seen.

33:28.800 --> 33:30.552
- Hence the wheelchair.
- Yes.

33:30.960 --> 33:32.598
What if he was seen?

33:36.120 --> 33:39.590
<i>There's a direct line of sight
from the ward to the garden below.</i>

33:41.080 --> 33:42.638
I believe Ben saw the murder

33:42.720 --> 33:45.188
and the killer saw him
and knew on the spot

33:45.280 --> 33:47.271
that he would have to silence the boy.

33:48.000 --> 33:50.958
Except that he waited two days
before killing Ben.

33:51.040 --> 33:53.474
In that time, Ben could have
told anyone what he'd witnessed.

33:55.040 --> 33:57.031
Excellent observation, Julia.

33:57.560 --> 34:00.279
Why wait indeed?
It's possible we are wrong.

34:02.600 --> 34:04.158
It's possible I'm wrong

34:04.240 --> 34:07.516
and Nurse Rowan's killer
didn't see Ben in the window after all.

34:07.760 --> 34:11.196
But then how did the killer know that
Ben had seen him murder Nurse Rowan?

34:13.280 --> 34:17.193
Last thing he said to me was,
"Our money troubles will soon be over. "

34:17.760 --> 34:21.435
Ben told his mother that
their money troubles would soon be over.

34:21.920 --> 34:24.717
She assumed that it meant
one less mouth to feed,

34:25.679 --> 34:28.319
but there's more than one way
to solve money troubles.

34:28.800 --> 34:30.119
Blackmail?

34:31.000 --> 34:33.036
But, William, Ben was 12 years old.

34:33.880 --> 34:37.873
A starving family is ample motivation
for a resourceful young boy.

34:38.719 --> 34:41.188
And blackmail is ample motive
for Ben's killer.

34:43.280 --> 34:47.558
Well, as Inspector Brackenreid would
say, that's all well and good, Murdoch,

34:47.639 --> 34:48.993
but where's the evidence?

34:52.280 --> 34:53.554
Ben's notebook.

34:59.920 --> 35:03.037
It's possible that what
you thought was the word 'zoo',

35:03.120 --> 35:06.396
was, in fact 200, as in dollars.

35:06.480 --> 35:07.708
The amount he was demanding?

35:07.800 --> 35:12.191
And'm' and 'y' are the first
and last letters of...

35:13.800 --> 35:14.835
Money.

35:14.920 --> 35:18.037
And 'g', 'd', and 'n'

35:18.560 --> 35:20.596
- are not Ogden, but...
- Garden.

35:21.840 --> 35:24.035
But Ben was not well enough
to go outside.

35:24.600 --> 35:28.513
That's true, but it all points
to blackmail, nonetheless.

35:29.240 --> 35:31.549
So if Ben collected the money
before he was killed...

35:32.080 --> 35:33.513
Where did he keep it?

35:35.360 --> 35:38.193
Ezra? Wake up.

35:39.800 --> 35:40.869
Go away.

35:42.040 --> 35:44.474
You're not in any trouble. Now, sit up.

35:49.720 --> 35:53.030
Ezra, did Ben stuff anything
into this toy?

35:54.320 --> 35:55.389
No.

35:56.720 --> 36:00.474
Ezra, we know you're lying.
Where's the money that was in here?

36:02.000 --> 36:03.433
I don't know what you mean.

36:22.400 --> 36:24.675
There appears to be
200 dollars here, Ezra.

36:24.760 --> 36:27.399
All right.
I saw Ben stuff the money in the toy.

36:27.480 --> 36:30.756
- When? Who gave it to him?
- I don't know.

36:31.680 --> 36:36.549
But the day before he died,
he went down to the end of the hallway.

36:37.520 --> 36:40.239
I had to go to some treatment
and, when I came back,

36:40.320 --> 36:42.197
I saw Ben stuff the money in the toy.

36:42.280 --> 36:44.589
That's all I know, I swear.

36:45.640 --> 36:47.039
There's soil on it.

36:47.360 --> 36:49.749
Look, I didn't steal from him.

36:50.640 --> 36:51.914
I wouldn't.

36:52.640 --> 36:54.915
But he was dead.

36:56.280 --> 37:00.398
I thought, when I'm cured,
I'll need money.

37:11.400 --> 37:12.469
Julia,

37:14.760 --> 37:16.591
this is a gardenia plant.

37:17.160 --> 37:18.229
Yes?

37:18.680 --> 37:20.750
The note,
it wasn't referring to the garden,

37:20.840 --> 37:22.478
where Nurse Rowan was killed,

37:22.560 --> 37:25.836
but the gardenia plant where the
blackmail money was to be left.

37:26.160 --> 37:28.993
Only the killer knows this and, now, us.

37:30.080 --> 37:32.196
This gives us the opportunity
to convince the killer

37:32.280 --> 37:34.396
that his blackmailer is still alive.

37:34.960 --> 37:37.918
Perhaps a cryptic note
left on the ward notice board.

37:38.000 --> 37:39.228
I don't follow.

37:39.320 --> 37:41.880
A note, one which only the killer
would understand.

37:41.960 --> 37:45.236
One that convinces him
that he murdered the wrong boy.

37:45.320 --> 37:47.788
One that demands another payment.

37:48.240 --> 37:50.151
To be left in the usual place.

37:50.480 --> 37:52.550
It might be enough
to force our killer's hand.

37:57.560 --> 37:59.073
So, McLeod,

37:59.760 --> 38:00.909
how long do you think it will be

38:01.000 --> 38:03.355
before we get the truth
out of your friend in Hamilton?

38:03.600 --> 38:06.398
The one who lied for you
about your whereabouts, April 23rd?

38:06.480 --> 38:09.153
He's not lying
and I will not confess to a murder

38:09.240 --> 38:11.276
that I couldn't possibly have committed.

38:15.680 --> 38:18.148
Higgins,
you can't just come barging in here.

38:18.240 --> 38:20.356
Can't you see that I'm in the middle
of an interview, man?

38:20.440 --> 38:22.192
I'm sorry, Constable Crabtree,

38:22.280 --> 38:24.919
I thought you'd like to know
that you were right.

38:25.000 --> 38:27.958
There was a safety negative
in Inspector Brackenreid's office.

38:28.040 --> 38:29.996
And are you sure
it's of the jewellery store robbery?

38:30.080 --> 38:31.991
I made a print of it myself, sir.

38:32.080 --> 38:33.718
It's the original all right.

38:36.120 --> 38:37.872
Well, well, well, McLeod.

38:38.960 --> 38:41.030
What do you have to say
for yourself now?

38:50.200 --> 38:51.553
Just as I thought.

39:37.880 --> 39:39.199
That was odd.

39:40.520 --> 39:43.830
I've never seen Mrs Abbot go into
the ward, other than on her tours.

39:59.720 --> 40:01.756
Step away from Ezra's bed, Mrs Abbot.

40:01.920 --> 40:05.549
Yes, he'll be needing it to sleep in
when he gets back.

40:07.120 --> 40:08.758
Why did you think it was Ezra?

40:11.280 --> 40:14.989
- Because he was a malicious child.
- But you killed Ben first.

40:15.440 --> 40:18.637
I watched him take the blackmail money
but, when I saw the second note,

40:18.720 --> 40:21.792
I realised that Ben must have been
doing Ezra's bidding.

40:23.280 --> 40:25.510
You were right
the first time, Mrs Abbot.

40:25.600 --> 40:27.955
Ben Digiorno was your blackmailer.

40:28.040 --> 40:30.235
You can rest assured
you killed the right boy.

40:31.320 --> 40:33.834
But what could Nurse Rowan
have possibly done to you?

40:34.200 --> 40:35.679
Why kill her?

40:36.600 --> 40:38.591
Because Nurse Rowan
and Dr Abbot were lovers.

40:38.680 --> 40:39.829
Please,

40:40.680 --> 40:42.079
don't speak of it.

40:43.160 --> 40:45.230
Your husband was her secret lover,

40:46.000 --> 40:49.436
and when he tried to break it off with
her, she wouldn't go quietly, would she?

40:50.120 --> 40:51.838
That awful whore.

40:52.920 --> 40:54.876
The hospital foundation is my life.

40:55.560 --> 40:56.595
When I found out about them,

40:56.680 --> 41:00.229
I demanded Lawrence stop endangering
everything that I'd worked for.

41:01.760 --> 41:04.194
His vulgar secret was bound to get out.

41:04.280 --> 41:07.033
He did as I asked. But she...

41:08.240 --> 41:09.912
She had to be stopped.

41:12.040 --> 41:15.157
<i>So you lured her to their
secret rendezvous spot with a note,</i>

41:15.240 --> 41:19.233
<i>supposedly from your husband,
asking for a reunion,</i>

41:19.320 --> 41:22.517
<i>where you injected her with enough
heroin to kill her instantly.</i>

41:23.600 --> 41:26.956
But you didn't know that Ben
had seen it all until afterwards,

41:27.360 --> 41:29.590
when his blackmail note
found its way to you.

41:31.560 --> 41:33.357
You knew what you had to do next.

41:35.720 --> 41:37.517
I had no choice.

41:37.680 --> 41:41.878
Mrs Abbot, you killed Nurse Rowan
and a young boy,

41:42.840 --> 41:45.479
to preserve your standing
in the community. I...

41:46.400 --> 41:48.311
I cannot find the words.

42:04.360 --> 42:07.158
And so I instructed my lads
to alter the film negative

42:07.240 --> 42:09.754
so they could convince McLeod
he'd been caught out.

42:09.840 --> 42:11.239
I beat him at his own game,
I did.

42:11.640 --> 42:13.790
Very clever, Inspector.
You're the hero.

42:18.760 --> 42:21.832
You said your readers love irony, Paddy.
Well, they're going to love this one.

42:21.920 --> 42:25.595
"Photographer hoisted on his own petard
caused by photographic sleight of hand. "

42:25.840 --> 42:28.593
And he would have got away with it
if he'd left well enough alone.

42:28.680 --> 42:30.352
And you can quote me on that, Patrick.

42:30.440 --> 42:32.078
Make sure you spell the name right.

42:32.160 --> 42:34.879
Of course, if this sleight of hand
ever catches on with the public,

42:34.960 --> 42:37.838
how will you boys ever trust
photographic evidence again?

42:37.920 --> 42:40.992
Still, all kudos to you, Inspector.

42:41.080 --> 42:42.672
Glynn.

42:46.640 --> 42:48.073
Glynn, come back.

42:48.160 --> 42:50.071
I've just recalled
a few important details.

42:50.160 --> 42:52.310
- Crabtree, get in here.
- Yes, sir.

42:55.160 --> 42:56.559
Are you sure you wouldn't consider

42:56.640 --> 42:58.551
a posting
with the Buffalo force, Detective?

42:58.840 --> 43:01.434
I can guarantee you
that we have more crime here.

43:01.920 --> 43:03.831
I'll take your offer
as a compliment, sir.

43:03.920 --> 43:06.434
It was. If you need anything,
you let me know.

43:06.880 --> 43:09.633
I will. Thank you, Detective Callahan.

43:10.920 --> 43:13.036
I wouldn't let her go either,
if I were you.

43:18.280 --> 43:19.793
My offer stands.

43:28.360 --> 43:31.591
- So I guess this is goodbye.
- Yes.

43:34.040 --> 43:36.838
- I've enjoyed our time together.
- As have I.

43:37.280 --> 43:38.998
It's like old times.

43:41.360 --> 43:43.920
It's done my heart
good to see you again, William.

43:44.000 --> 43:47.390
But I feel that we haven't
had nearly enough time together

43:47.480 --> 43:49.675
- to just be ourselves.
- I agree.

43:50.560 --> 43:51.879
- Julia, I...
- William!

43:51.960 --> 43:53.632
What are you doing?

43:55.200 --> 43:58.078
- Nothing. I...
- Oh, William...

43:59.680 --> 44:02.148
I can't possibly renew
our relationship together.

44:03.800 --> 44:05.358
What's to stop us?

44:08.880 --> 44:10.472
I'm engaged to be married.

44:13.800 --> 44:15.711
Oh, I see.

44:18.200 --> 44:19.792
Why didn't you tell me?

44:21.040 --> 44:22.712
There was never a good time.

44:24.160 --> 44:25.639
There still isn't.

44:28.200 --> 44:29.872
May I ask to whom?

44:30.680 --> 44:32.955
Well, yes. You've met him.

44:33.360 --> 44:35.237
It's Dr Darcy Garland.

44:39.000 --> 44:40.672
Where are my manners?

44:40.760 --> 44:44.275
Congratulations to you, Julia,
and to Dr Garland as well.

44:45.480 --> 44:46.959
Thank you, William.
