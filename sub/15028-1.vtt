WEBVTT

03:08.105 --> 03:10.856
Making some eggs.
Yeah, makin' some eggs.

03:10.857 --> 03:12.066
What do you see?

03:12.067 --> 03:13.567
<i>Hey '</i>

03:13.568 --> 03:16.237
she ruined the surprise.

03:16.238 --> 03:17.863
What could she be doing?

03:17.864 --> 03:19.615
Good morning.

03:19.616 --> 03:21.117
I think somebody misses you.

03:22.119 --> 03:23.953
That 'cause it's your big Clay?

03:23.954 --> 03:25.830
Yeah, it is.
Good morning.

03:29.418 --> 03:31.586
Thank you letting mommy sleep.

03:33.588 --> 03:34.839
You excited?

03:34.840 --> 03:36.799
Should we tell her
what else we're making?

03:36.800 --> 03:38.467
- Bacon. Yeah.
- Oh.

03:38.468 --> 03:40.177
You're making, did
you cook the bacon?

03:40.178 --> 03:42.847
- All by herself.
- Chef.

03:51.314 --> 03:52.940
Amen.

04:31.897 --> 04:34.774
Raised in the likeness
of his resurrection,

04:34.775 --> 04:37.818
you are hereby recognized
before the father,

04:37.819 --> 04:40.947
the son and the holy spirit.

04:41.406 --> 04:43.032
Amen.

04:57.172 --> 04:59.089
<i>♪ Gonna tear it all down</i>

04:59.090 --> 05:02.176
<i>♪ wait for the sunrise
a' wait for the sunrise</i>

05:02.177 --> 05:04.262
pleasure, anytime, enjoy.

05:08.809 --> 05:10.684
Hello minister.

05:10.685 --> 05:12.395
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

05:12.771 --> 05:14.397
Hi ladies!

05:16.441 --> 05:17.733
Thank you.

05:18.568 --> 05:19.694
Hi.

05:21.071 --> 05:23.198
You're welcome.
Enjoy, eat, please.

06:01.987 --> 06:03.571
Sarah.

06:03.572 --> 06:05.323
I didn't mean to startle you.

06:06.408 --> 06:09.452
As you were.
I'm not here to chastise.

06:10.954 --> 06:13.414
That was a lovely
ceremony today.

06:13.415 --> 06:15.958
A long time coming.

06:15.959 --> 06:20.421
Well, after all the occasions
that brown's had to be there

06:20.422 --> 06:24.922
for other people's children,
yes, it was quite special.

06:26.177 --> 06:27.887
Oh, I wanted to give you this.

06:28.555 --> 06:31.599
It's for skya, and
also for your house.

06:35.020 --> 06:37.271
The voice of the holy spirit.

06:37.272 --> 06:38.356
Wow.

06:39.107 --> 06:40.608
I didn't expect you...

06:42.485 --> 06:43.736
Thank you.

06:45.280 --> 06:47.698
And I also wanted
to ask about-

06:47.699 --> 06:50.034
fine. Thank you,
everything's fine.

06:51.328 --> 06:53.872
Good.
Glad to hear it.

06:56.583 --> 06:58.042
I realized later

06:58.043 --> 07:00.210
that I must have caught
her in a good mood

07:00.211 --> 07:01.921
or a moment of
weakness or something

07:01.922 --> 07:03.339
because...

07:03.340 --> 07:04.382
Hoo!

07:04.966 --> 07:09.466
He let his faith fall in that which at
least is faithful also in much.

07:09.721 --> 07:12.848
Just replace “he" with “she"
and “is faithful" with

07:12.849 --> 07:15.434
“has her sister stand
up to her bitchy self

07:15.435 --> 07:17.395
once in her g-d life."

07:26.404 --> 07:27.571
Well clone.

07:27.572 --> 07:29.990
We ran out of Mac and
cheese almost immediately.

07:29.991 --> 07:31.575
May not have been
as good as gold,

07:31.576 --> 07:34.537
- but it was surely good enough.
- Surely good enough.

07:37.040 --> 07:38.541
I'm up.

07:40.460 --> 07:41.711
<i>Hey '</i>

07:42.087 --> 07:44.339
think it's a magetto
fire road kinda night?

08:58.580 --> 08:59.956
Honey.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.418
What is it?

09:17.182 --> 09:18.766
The sun.

09:19.851 --> 09:21.269
It's okay.

09:21.728 --> 09:23.229
Take your time.

09:27.567 --> 09:29.360
I can't, I can't believe.

09:31.488 --> 09:35.074
He had it.
It happened, but...

09:38.787 --> 09:39.913
But it did.

09:40.914 --> 09:43.249
Bram, what happened?

09:46.127 --> 09:47.878
Something wonderful.

09:50.548 --> 09:51.715
I believe...

09:53.551 --> 09:55.094
I believe that...

09:55.929 --> 09:59.140
That god almighty himself,
he appeared to me.

10:00.934 --> 10:02.185
Tonight.

10:04.521 --> 10:06.105
In the most literal sense.

10:10.068 --> 10:12.236
Moses and the burning bush.

10:12.237 --> 10:14.447
He, he was here.

10:16.950 --> 10:18.242
But...

10:21.996 --> 10:23.414
What...

10:25.834 --> 10:27.668
Did he speak to you?

10:27.669 --> 10:29.086
Oh, Sarah, it was,

10:29.087 --> 10:30.713
it was wonderful.

10:35.343 --> 10:38.137
I was in bed,
only it was a dream.

10:38.138 --> 10:41.014
It was, but it was more present,

10:41.015 --> 10:44.893
more nearer than anything
I'd ever experienced.

10:47.063 --> 10:49.440
He appeared over me
but he was...

10:50.483 --> 10:52.234
He was everywhere.

10:54.112 --> 10:55.738
There was, there was light.

10:57.448 --> 10:59.491
There was so much light.

11:01.161 --> 11:02.453
Then he...

11:03.830 --> 11:05.122
What?

11:06.499 --> 11:07.917
He spoke.

11:10.587 --> 11:12.005
His voice was,

11:12.463 --> 11:13.797
it was in me.

11:14.549 --> 11:16.008
Through me.

11:17.510 --> 11:18.844
And...

11:21.264 --> 11:24.392
I don't know how else to say it,
but he said...

11:26.311 --> 11:27.603
What?

11:29.522 --> 11:31.565
He said that there was
something coming for us.

11:33.401 --> 11:34.819
For me.

11:35.862 --> 11:39.407
And that soon,
he would be calling upon us.

11:42.785 --> 11:44.953
That would be an act
of great importance.

11:47.874 --> 11:49.458
And then I...

11:51.044 --> 11:52.628
I would be his right hand.

11:57.967 --> 11:59.510
<i>Let's dry-</i>

12:00.053 --> 12:01.345
yes.

12:03.890 --> 12:05.141
Yes.

12:30.291 --> 12:32.418
- Amen.
- Amen.

12:53.940 --> 12:55.691
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

12:55.692 --> 12:57.860
- Good bye.
- Bye daddy.

12:58.027 --> 12:59.278
<i>Hey '</i>

12:59.904 --> 13:01.572
just be in touch, okay?

13:03.491 --> 13:04.909
Anything happens,

13:07.328 --> 13:09.079
I'm not gonna say
anything to anyone.

13:09.831 --> 13:11.249
To Uriel.

13:12.625 --> 13:15.168
I just, I think we should
keep this to ourselves

13:15.169 --> 13:16.879
until we have the whole picture.

13:18.631 --> 13:19.673
Of course.

13:32.603 --> 13:34.187
Hi there.

13:34.188 --> 13:35.689
Sorry for just
showing up like this,

13:35.690 --> 13:36.732
but I noticed yesterday

13:36.733 --> 13:38.442
you had some sort
of baby party here,

13:38.443 --> 13:39.902
and I wanted to contribute.

13:43.197 --> 13:45.199
- Thank you.
- Oh, you're very welcome.

13:45.408 --> 13:48.785
We made a whole batch this morning,
so it's not any trouble.

13:48.786 --> 13:50.912
<i>Ma?
.My-"</i>

13:50.913 --> 13:53.206
well, Joseph and I.

13:53.374 --> 13:54.583
Right.

13:54.584 --> 13:55.876
- I'm sorry-
- you know what actually,

13:55.877 --> 13:57.587
I'm on my way out.

13:57.754 --> 13:58.795
Sorry.

13:58.796 --> 14:01.215
Right, well um, another time.

14:29.243 --> 14:31.787
Wasn't that just the
most gorgeous ceremony

14:31.788 --> 14:33.747
the other Clay?

14:33.748 --> 14:35.124
Mm-hmm.

14:36.417 --> 14:37.918
You sure I can't get you one?

14:39.462 --> 14:40.629
Mom.

14:44.175 --> 14:45.551
So what else is new?

14:49.722 --> 14:50.973
Nothing big.

14:52.975 --> 14:54.017
Oh wow.

14:55.144 --> 14:57.562
That's Sam Taylor's mom.

14:57.563 --> 14:59.481
What was her name?

14:59.482 --> 15:01.691
- Victoria.
- Rig ht.

15:01.692 --> 15:03.527
So sad.

15:05.530 --> 15:07.739
There were always
rumors you know.

15:07.740 --> 15:09.783
What do you mean?

15:09.784 --> 15:11.576
Well, it...

15:11.577 --> 15:13.078
Jacob was odd.

15:14.038 --> 15:16.373
- Yeah, the brother.
- Yeah.

15:17.959 --> 15:21.379
He never acted like a,
well, like a normal adult.

15:23.506 --> 15:24.798
Don't get me wrong.

15:24.799 --> 15:26.341
He wasn't 30 years old,
wearing diapers,

15:26.342 --> 15:29.553
coloring on walls or
anything like that.

15:29.554 --> 15:32.473
He was just odd.

15:34.684 --> 15:37.018
You remember the
one family festival?

15:37.019 --> 15:38.353
Yeah, of course.

15:39.814 --> 15:42.107
There were stories about

15:42.108 --> 15:44.151
a dinner party.

15:44.569 --> 15:46.486
Some of the things your
husband did at his worst,

15:46.487 --> 15:47.988
they can't even compare.

15:50.199 --> 15:52.576
That's what made
it so unfortunate.

15:52.577 --> 15:54.203
I thought.

15:54.370 --> 15:56.997
For Victoria, and then
of course for Sam.

15:58.791 --> 16:02.419
The fact that the
signs were all there,

16:02.420 --> 16:04.505
adding up and up and up,

16:05.423 --> 16:09.923
and Victoria just
thought what she thought.

16:11.053 --> 16:12.304
Didn't matter.

16:14.223 --> 16:16.183
Well, maybe if she'd
had her eyes open

16:16.184 --> 16:17.727
she'd still be with us.

16:20.730 --> 16:24.774
Sarah, I know skya is the end

16:24.775 --> 16:26.902
of a long road for you and bram,

16:26.903 --> 16:29.946
but all things considered,
your life is still very blessed.

16:29.947 --> 16:31.031
I know that.

16:31.908 --> 16:34.410
And others don't, and that's
why they get into trouble.

16:35.786 --> 16:37.621
Sarah, when Victoria
was working-

16:37.788 --> 16:39.581
signals were being sent
to her day after Clay

16:39.582 --> 16:41.750
and she did nothing.

16:41.751 --> 16:43.960
Sometimes it isn't
as easy as that.

16:43.961 --> 16:45.128
Yes, it is.

16:46.464 --> 16:50.509
And I'm sorry, but having a son
who's unbalanced

16:50.510 --> 16:52.636
is not worse than
having to drive yourself

16:52.637 --> 16:54.763
to the hospital after
your third miscarriage

16:54.764 --> 16:57.767
because your husband is too drunk
to get himself off the couch.

17:00.353 --> 17:02.312
Maybe.

17:02.313 --> 17:06.813
Maybe if Victoria Tanner
had just taken a moment to think.

17:10.363 --> 17:12.948
Maybe Sam wouldn't have found her
face down in the swimming pool

17:12.949 --> 17:15.034
with a knife in her back.

17:28.673 --> 17:30.298
<i>Hey '</i>

17:30.299 --> 17:32.259
hey, could you give us a hand?

17:32.260 --> 17:33.719
Sure, gimme one sec.

17:38.849 --> 17:40.976
It was all I could do
to keep quiet today.

17:40.977 --> 17:42.436
It was the same for me.

17:43.729 --> 17:47.023
I just, I feel so full.

17:48.359 --> 17:49.610
I used it.

17:51.862 --> 17:53.655
Today.

17:54.907 --> 17:58.660
Today is a special day,
my brothers and sisters.

18:00.413 --> 18:03.248
Special because you
are here with me,

18:03.249 --> 18:05.875
and I with you.

18:05.876 --> 18:08.795
And because we
are here together,

18:08.796 --> 18:10.964
we know we are on
the right path.

18:10.965 --> 18:12.632
Know it.

18:12.633 --> 18:14.968
And yet, there are moments,

18:14.969 --> 18:17.554
past and future,

18:17.555 --> 18:19.723
that we question that.

18:19.724 --> 18:20.974
Why?

18:20.975 --> 18:23.727
Because of an inherent weakness?

18:24.645 --> 18:25.812
No.

18:26.439 --> 18:28.941
Because of an inherent humanity.

18:30.860 --> 18:32.528
A man is lost in the woods.

18:33.529 --> 18:35.072
What keeps him trudging on?

18:36.699 --> 18:37.700
Faith.

18:38.868 --> 18:42.496
A man suffers terrible injury.

18:42.997 --> 18:45.540
What keeps him from succumbing?

18:45.541 --> 18:46.958
Faith.

18:46.959 --> 18:49.711
A man's family is torn from him

18:49.712 --> 18:51.213
long before their time.

18:52.256 --> 18:54.799
What raises him from his bed

18:54.800 --> 18:57.719
each and every morning?

18:59.597 --> 19:00.723
Faith.

19:01.807 --> 19:03.475
Yes.

19:03.476 --> 19:04.934
Maintain your faith

19:04.935 --> 19:07.687
by embracing your
inherent humanity

19:08.939 --> 19:11.483
even in the face of
apparent hopelessness,

19:11.484 --> 19:15.528
because when you put
your faith in lord god,

19:15.529 --> 19:18.865
sooner or later you
will be rewarded.

19:20.284 --> 19:23.704
Your faith will
become certainty,

19:24.914 --> 19:27.207
because he is here
with us always.

19:28.793 --> 19:30.586
We are never alone.

19:35.549 --> 19:38.260
- I love you.
- I love you.

20:06.997 --> 20:08.748
Honey, what's going on?

20:15.506 --> 20:17.883
Bram, tell me...

20:37.611 --> 20:38.611
<i>Hey '</i>

20:38.654 --> 20:39.946
sorry.

20:41.699 --> 20:43.742
I was trying not to
have that happen.

20:47.121 --> 20:48.622
Are you okay?

21:01.051 --> 21:02.802
I didn't wanna come here again.

21:05.014 --> 21:06.973
I didn't wanna come
here in the first place.

21:06.974 --> 21:09.392
It's fine, taking a
step was my decision.

21:09.393 --> 21:10.894
We've covered that.

21:10.895 --> 21:13.104
I know that my behavior
has been irregular,

21:13.105 --> 21:15.064
but I've told you over and over

21:15.065 --> 21:16.608
that there are some
changes, and...

21:17.860 --> 21:19.903
I have to work through
them on my own.

21:21.238 --> 21:22.739
So, I just...

21:23.991 --> 21:25.950
- I need some time.
- You've had time.

21:25.951 --> 21:28.870
- Weeks.
- Then I need more time I guess.

21:30.206 --> 21:32.541
Sarah, how does
that make you feel?

21:33.501 --> 21:34.668
Frustrated.

21:35.294 --> 21:37.170
I feel like he's
keeping secrets.

21:37.171 --> 21:38.588
Secrets he doesn't
have to be keeping

21:38.589 --> 21:41.883
because I'm here for him
through anything.

21:42.760 --> 21:45.970
Bramwell, are you hearing
what Sarah's saying?

21:45.971 --> 21:48.640
Yes, and I appreciate it.

21:50.267 --> 21:52.018
But if I decide that
something is for the best,

21:52.019 --> 21:54.103
I think that my wife
should honor that.

21:54.104 --> 21:55.855
Bram, you haven't
slept in almost a month.

21:57.066 --> 21:58.358
You're barely eating.

21:59.652 --> 22:01.820
Your behavior is almost
exactly how it was-

22:01.821 --> 22:02.822
Sarah.

22:04.198 --> 22:07.284
I'm not drinking, you know that.
It's a fact.

22:08.327 --> 22:11.204
Sarah, do you know that?

22:12.706 --> 22:14.916
My head does.

22:14.917 --> 22:19.170
Bramwell, the position
you've taken is valid.

22:19.171 --> 22:22.590
Ephesians asks that wives
submit unto their husbands

22:22.591 --> 22:25.176
as they would unto the lord.

22:25.177 --> 22:27.303
For the husband is
the head of the wife

22:27.304 --> 22:29.097
as Christ is the
head of the church,

22:29.098 --> 22:33.598
and therefore, as the
church submits to Christ,

22:33.602 --> 22:36.688
so let wives do
unto their husbands.

22:36.689 --> 22:41.189
However, your position
has validity too, Sarah.

22:43.279 --> 22:45.363
What you described,

22:45.364 --> 22:47.949
and described on
several occasions,

22:47.950 --> 22:51.745
is behavior that is,
to say the least, unusual.

22:52.454 --> 22:53.997
And it seems to me

22:53.998 --> 22:56.916
is indicative of
a larger problem,

22:56.917 --> 23:00.128
but we're not going
to make any progress

23:00.129 --> 23:03.257
until bram is honest.

23:06.135 --> 23:10.635
Are you telling us, truly,
that there's nothing wrong?

23:11.932 --> 23:13.850
I'm honestly telling you

23:13.851 --> 23:16.769
I need to work
through some things.

23:16.770 --> 23:19.063
- For how long?
- As long as it takes.

23:20.983 --> 23:22.859
I'm very sorry,

23:22.860 --> 23:26.404
but I can't live like this
for as long as it takes.

23:26.405 --> 23:28.907
And for the past monthl feel
I've been sharing the house

23:28.908 --> 23:31.367
with some sort of photocopy.

23:31.368 --> 23:33.328
It constantly reminds
me of how things were,

23:35.247 --> 23:37.165
and I can't go back to that.

23:38.959 --> 23:40.710
I'm sorry, I just can't.

23:42.129 --> 23:44.840
- What do you want me to do?
- I want you to tell him.

23:46.383 --> 23:48.092
I don't think
that's a good idea.

23:48.093 --> 23:50.136
I think it's the only idea.

23:50.137 --> 23:52.221
Bramwell,

23:52.222 --> 23:54.140
what's she referring to?

24:11.742 --> 24:13.160
As I understand it...

24:16.288 --> 24:18.498
I've been visited
by god almighty.

24:24.421 --> 24:26.172
Well, that's wonderful.

24:26.173 --> 24:27.632
It was.

24:28.801 --> 24:30.885
He appeared to me and
said that something important

24:30.886 --> 24:33.304
was gonna fall on Sarah and I,

24:33.305 --> 24:35.598
and that I would be the
one to carry it out.

24:36.934 --> 24:38.768
And when was this?

24:38.769 --> 24:40.311
33 days ago.

24:40.312 --> 24:42.439
And has it happened again since?

24:48.862 --> 24:50.488
Every night.

24:52.157 --> 24:55.118
And on these
subsequent occasions...

24:57.037 --> 24:58.830
Has he spoken to you?

25:00.332 --> 25:03.043
- Yeah.
- What has he said?

25:05.629 --> 25:06.921
Try to understand.

25:07.965 --> 25:08.965
Please.

25:10.259 --> 25:11.385
His words.

25:13.303 --> 25:14.679
They aren't like ours.

25:16.640 --> 25:18.433
It's as if you were
born blind and deaf

25:18.434 --> 25:20.351
and gained everything at once.

25:20.352 --> 25:21.644
It's overwhelming.

25:22.896 --> 25:24.272
But as I understand it...

25:26.942 --> 25:30.654
If I do not carry out his will,
the end times are nigh.

25:32.740 --> 25:34.074
He's shown it to me.

25:36.326 --> 25:39.287
Darkness covers the earth,

25:39.288 --> 25:40.955
piece by piece,

25:40.956 --> 25:43.249
closer and closer.

25:45.294 --> 25:47.963
Other things change, but
that's always how it begins.

25:51.175 --> 25:53.093
People turn on each other.

25:54.386 --> 25:56.846
Action is taken
but to no effect.

25:58.974 --> 26:00.308
Fear and pain only grow

26:00.309 --> 26:03.520
and long after it's
become too much to bear...

26:06.356 --> 26:09.192
The earth itself
swallows all who remain.

26:10.194 --> 26:12.446
And what is his will?

26:13.113 --> 26:17.613
What must we do
to prevent this from happening?

26:23.999 --> 26:25.542
As I understand it...

26:33.217 --> 26:35.677
I must kill my only child.

26:57.407 --> 27:00.410
Your confession has shown
tremendous courage, bramwell.

27:02.162 --> 27:04.455
But understand that

27:04.456 --> 27:07.584
there are many ways to interpret
what you've experienced.

27:09.253 --> 27:10.712
Interpret?

27:11.964 --> 27:14.841
Well first, and
most importantly...

27:15.926 --> 27:17.802
Of course,
you haven't considered...

27:19.513 --> 27:20.972
No, of course not.

27:22.474 --> 27:23.933
Next.

27:26.478 --> 27:30.106
Are you certain that
what you've seen are visions

27:30.107 --> 27:31.732
as opposed to dreams?

27:31.733 --> 27:33.025
Yes.

27:33.944 --> 27:37.447
Of that one thing I am certain.

27:38.282 --> 27:41.242
Well, count yourself blessed

27:41.243 --> 27:43.119
that you've received his touch.

27:44.538 --> 27:47.373
But know that wise
men, historically,

27:47.374 --> 27:51.794
have posited that
he would never ask

27:51.795 --> 27:54.714
the slaughter of
one of his children.

27:55.382 --> 27:56.549
But, the...

27:56.550 --> 27:59.261
By Abraham and Issac,
the binding.

28:00.012 --> 28:02.055
Jeremiah 32:35.

28:02.222 --> 28:05.016
God speaks of the ancient
israelite practice

28:05.017 --> 28:07.393
of child sacrifice,

28:07.394 --> 28:11.894
and he asserts it
never entered my mind

28:12.774 --> 28:14.776
that they would do
this abomination.

28:15.360 --> 28:17.361
Now you said it yourself.

28:17.362 --> 28:19.989
God's words are not ours.

28:20.741 --> 28:22.533
As early as the 1300s,

28:22.534 --> 28:27.034
it was suggested that unlike
the cruel heathen deities,

28:27.664 --> 28:32.164
our lord in heaven requires only
spiritual surrender.

28:32.836 --> 28:36.172
It was Abraham's imagination
that led him astray.

28:39.092 --> 28:43.554
All god wishes
is to know that you are his.

28:45.140 --> 28:46.891
Mind, body and soul.

28:47.684 --> 28:48.810
Yes.

28:49.353 --> 28:50.771
Of course.

28:52.356 --> 28:54.900
Then go forth with
this new certainty.

28:56.985 --> 28:58.695
Be troubled no more.

29:08.247 --> 29:10.706
<i>Hello, you've reached
Sarah eyman's cell phone.</i>

29:10.707 --> 29:13.793
<i>Please leave a message and I'll
get back to you as soon as I can.</i>

29:13.794 --> 29:15.837
<i>Thank you, have a blessed day.</i>

29:17.297 --> 29:21.797
<i>Sarah, hello,
this is minister Uriel.</i>

29:23.303 --> 29:25.471
<i>As you might imagine,
i was a bit taken aback</i>

29:25.472 --> 29:27.431
<i>this afternoon by what occurred.</i>

29:27.432 --> 29:28.599
<i>It's not everyday</i>

29:28.600 --> 29:31.561
<i>that something of this
magnitude presents itself.</i>

29:32.604 --> 29:34.897
<i>I hope that my
counsel was helpful,</i>

29:34.898 --> 29:37.233
<i>and I pray that it means</i>

29:37.234 --> 29:39.235
<i>the end of this trouble
for you and yours,</i>

29:39.236 --> 29:42.655
<i>but, if it isn't,</i>

29:42.656 --> 29:47.156
<i>if bramwell's visions
persist or intensify,</i>

29:48.120 --> 29:49.954
<i>I have some information here</i>

29:49.955 --> 29:52.665
<i>regarding someone that
you might consider seeing.</i>

29:52.666 --> 29:54.668
<i>A good god fearing man.</i>

29:56.295 --> 29:57.671
<i>A psychiatrist.</i>

29:58.880 --> 30:02.008
<i>He helped my brother in a
time of need a few years ago and he...</i>

30:03.677 --> 30:06.304
<i>Well, that's all.</i>

30:06.805 --> 30:08.056
<i>God bless.</i>

30:15.981 --> 30:17.940
Did you have fun at Nana's?

30:17.941 --> 30:20.026
Yes, you did.

30:20.027 --> 30:21.194
Yes you did.

30:46.595 --> 30:49.389
How dare you.

30:50.515 --> 30:51.807
Bram?

30:52.684 --> 30:54.769
You questioned my will.

30:56.938 --> 31:00.358
You shake your fist
at me in defiance.

31:00.359 --> 31:03.653
- Bram, wake up.
- I will not be commanded!

31:05.155 --> 31:06.364
First...

31:07.491 --> 31:10.035
Darkness covers the land.

31:11.286 --> 31:14.038
Brother turns against brother.

31:14.748 --> 31:18.292
It all begins with your child.

31:18.293 --> 31:20.002
Bram, stop this.

31:20.003 --> 31:21.796
You have yet to
learn the meaning

31:21.963 --> 31:24.632
of spiritual surrender.

31:26.218 --> 31:30.718
Bramwell, your family
must remain whole

31:32.682 --> 31:35.101
until the night,

31:35.102 --> 31:36.812
the night that you
remove your daughter

31:36.978 --> 31:38.312
from all others.

31:39.398 --> 31:42.483
- All who meddle.
- Stop this right now.

31:42.484 --> 31:44.693
- Present her to me.
- Stop it!

31:44.694 --> 31:47.363
And cut her heart
from her chest!

31:47.364 --> 31:48.907
No!

31:54.079 --> 31:55.538
What happened?

31:55.539 --> 31:56.623
What happened?

32:06.716 --> 32:08.592
Well, it appears as
though we're looking

32:08.593 --> 32:11.053
at a sort of good news,
bad news situation.

32:11.680 --> 32:12.847
The good news is,

32:12.848 --> 32:14.223
there does not appear
to be a single thing

32:14.224 --> 32:15.724
medically wrong with you.

32:15.725 --> 32:18.561
Everything is right
where it needs to be.

32:18.728 --> 32:20.521
Nothing barren or out of place.

32:21.940 --> 32:23.941
The bad news is,

32:23.942 --> 32:27.278
if everything you've told me
is the god's honest truth,

32:29.489 --> 32:32.492
signs point toward you're
suffering a psychotic break.

32:34.327 --> 32:36.162
And that's another
matter entirely.

32:36.621 --> 32:39.415
Great, thank you.
Goodbye.

32:41.501 --> 32:44.587
Okay, we're all set
for tomorrow at 12:30.

32:45.213 --> 32:46.631
Is that still okay?

32:47.424 --> 32:49.050
None of this is okay.

32:51.678 --> 32:53.345
I appreciate that, bram,

32:53.346 --> 32:55.556
which is why we're taking
steps to get you well.

32:58.393 --> 33:01.270
Look, Uriel spoke very
highly of Dr. kore.

33:02.647 --> 33:05.399
- With any luck, maybe he'll-
- he's not a doctor.

33:06.401 --> 33:07.735
He's a shrink.

33:09.237 --> 33:11.447
I think it's the same thing.

33:12.741 --> 33:14.116
I'm gonna go there,

33:14.117 --> 33:15.784
and he's gonna
say that I'm crazy

33:15.785 --> 33:18.037
and put me on all
sorts of medications

33:18.038 --> 33:20.539
or ship me off somewhere

33:20.540 --> 33:22.958
where I'm not gonna be able
to see either of you anymore.

33:22.959 --> 33:24.960
Bram, what's happening to you?

33:24.961 --> 33:26.921
I don't know what's
happening to me, Sarah.

33:28.215 --> 33:29.882
I think that maybe we're
looking for answers

33:29.883 --> 33:31.634
in the wrong places.

33:31.635 --> 33:32.761
Wrong places?

33:33.929 --> 33:35.847
We devoted ourselves
to something, Sarah.

33:37.724 --> 33:39.183
Something bigger than ourselves.

33:40.644 --> 33:42.044
Something that has
been there for us

33:42.145 --> 33:44.313
through good and through bad.

33:44.314 --> 33:45.689
Something that's
solved our problems

33:45.690 --> 33:47.816
when we both didn't think
that we could get any lower,

33:47.817 --> 33:49.276
and I don't think that
it's in our best interest

33:49.277 --> 33:51.320
to just cast that
off the moment...

33:51.321 --> 33:53.447
The moment that what?

33:53.448 --> 33:55.157
Mind your tone.

33:55.158 --> 33:56.784
Please.

33:58.537 --> 34:00.872
It's worth thinking about,
that's all I'm saying.

34:01.498 --> 34:03.040
No, bram, I saw
something the other night

34:03.041 --> 34:04.333
that I've never seen before.

34:04.334 --> 34:06.835
I don't think anyone
has ever seen before.

34:06.836 --> 34:08.128
Okay, I don't know
who was speaking to me

34:08.129 --> 34:09.880
in our bedroom,
but it wasn't you.

34:09.880 --> 34:11.465
Do you understand?

34:12.592 --> 34:13.926
So what happens the next time

34:13.927 --> 34:16.178
that little visitor
decides to show up?

34:16.179 --> 34:17.429
But instead of just talking,

34:17.429 --> 34:18.889
he wanders into the
kitchen and gets a knife

34:18.889 --> 34:20.683
and finishes the
business out for himself.

34:20.684 --> 34:22.893
I don't think that that's
the way that it works.

34:22.893 --> 34:25.813
If god wanted skya dead, bram,

34:25.813 --> 34:28.023
she would be dead.

34:28.024 --> 34:30.192
He would have caved
the roof in on her

34:30.193 --> 34:32.902
or blown out my tires
with her in the car

34:32.904 --> 34:34.321
or set off a gas leak

34:34.322 --> 34:36.072
one of the ten times a day
that she's in the kitchen,

34:36.074 --> 34:38.742
but she's still here,
healthy as can be.

34:38.743 --> 34:40.244
Sarah, I'm sorry,

34:40.245 --> 34:42.079
but I don't think that
that's the way that it works.

34:42.080 --> 34:45.248
I think his children
need to act on their own.

34:46.626 --> 34:48.878
Great, so our
alternative is what?

34:49.879 --> 34:51.589
You just keep
having these visions

34:51.590 --> 34:53.716
night after night
for the rest of your life

34:53.717 --> 34:55.217
for the next 50 years?

34:55.217 --> 34:56.594
God will not suffer you

34:56.594 --> 34:58.971
to be tempted above
that ye are able.

34:58.972 --> 35:00.889
But will with that temptation
make away to escape

35:00.890 --> 35:02.558
that ye shall be
able to bear it.

35:04.894 --> 35:06.604
I will bear what I must.

35:08.148 --> 35:09.815
It was what?

35:09.816 --> 35:10.983
Three weeks.

35:10.984 --> 35:12.776
Three weeks until you

35:12.777 --> 35:15.279
stopped acknowledging
our child all together.

35:15.947 --> 35:18.741
How many more nights
until you stop sleeping,

35:18.742 --> 35:21.286
avoiding what's
happening completely?

35:21.745 --> 35:24.913
And how long after that
until you turn back to alcohol?

35:24.914 --> 35:28.250
How long after that
until you break entirely?

35:28.251 --> 35:30.503
I will bare what I must.

35:33.173 --> 35:34.924
What are you suggesting then?

35:36.635 --> 35:39.011
We asked the minister for
help and that didn't work.

35:39.012 --> 35:41.848
Oh that didn't
work spectacularly.

35:42.641 --> 35:44.309
We looked for physical evidence.

35:44.934 --> 35:46.268
Nothing there.

35:48.063 --> 35:49.438
So if not this next step,

35:49.439 --> 35:53.693
if not cold, clinical,
psychiatric diagnosis,

35:53.902 --> 35:55.235
then what?

35:55.236 --> 35:56.779
I don't know.

35:56.780 --> 35:58.656
I don't know.

35:58.657 --> 36:01.533
But, I think if we're willing to
surrender our faith so easily

36:01.534 --> 36:04.370
then what was the
point of any of it?

36:04.371 --> 36:06.205
I am not surrendering a thing.

36:06.206 --> 36:08.332
I am making sure that the
death of our infant daughter

36:08.333 --> 36:09.875
isn't the result of
a chemical imbalance

36:09.876 --> 36:11.544
in her father's brain.

36:23.264 --> 36:25.099
I'll sleep on the couch.

37:51.394 --> 37:53.813
I'm well, mom, thanks.
How are you?

37:54.939 --> 37:56.106
She's good.

37:57.442 --> 37:58.901
Hey, I know this is
kind of last minute

37:58.902 --> 38:00.945
and you're always saying that...

38:01.905 --> 38:04.657
Would you mind coming over
and spending some time with her?

38:09.496 --> 38:11.246
Oh, hi.

38:11.247 --> 38:12.873
Hello.

38:12.874 --> 38:15.459
I um, I brought you this.

38:15.460 --> 38:17.795
You and your Joseph.

38:17.796 --> 38:19.171
Was that his name?

38:19.172 --> 38:22.174
It is a thank you.
You know, for the other day.

38:22.175 --> 38:23.675
Oh, thank you.

38:23.676 --> 38:26.970
That's not at all necessary,
but we appreciate it.

38:26.971 --> 38:28.222
Yeah.

38:29.390 --> 38:30.974
- Listen, you want-
- are you-

38:31.518 --> 38:33.602
- we have to stop doing that.
- Right.

38:33.603 --> 38:35.354
Ladies first.

38:35.355 --> 38:36.939
I um...

38:36.940 --> 38:38.565
I think I'm...

38:38.566 --> 38:41.318
I might have made some
unfair judgements before,

38:41.319 --> 38:43.987
and that's not the
person I strive to be,

38:43.988 --> 38:48.033
so it was unfair of me
and I apologize.

38:51.579 --> 38:53.914
So, what was that party

38:54.082 --> 38:56.416
you had at your place
a couple weeks back?

38:56.417 --> 38:58.126
You know, had to do
with little uh...

38:58.127 --> 39:00.045
- Oh, skya.
- Skya.

39:00.046 --> 39:01.672
Oh my god, how cute is that?

39:01.673 --> 39:03.048
What was it, her
birthday or something?

39:03.049 --> 39:05.259
- No, it was her christening.
- Oh.

39:05.260 --> 39:07.135
Now, explain something to me,

39:07.136 --> 39:09.888
'cause I guess I've
never really known.

39:09.889 --> 39:11.598
What is a christening?

39:11.599 --> 39:13.725
I mean, it's kind of like
a baptism, right?

39:13.726 --> 39:15.143
There's a ceremony
and the rest of it,

39:15.144 --> 39:17.271
but, you know, what's it mean?

39:18.106 --> 39:19.606
It's a sacrament.

39:19.607 --> 39:21.108
It means a divine grace.

39:21.109 --> 39:23.193
It cleanses original sin.

39:23.194 --> 39:24.320
Oh.

39:24.988 --> 39:27.573
Okay, so you like
really believe all that?

39:31.536 --> 39:34.288
And your answer is yes, Gabe,
that is exactly what I believe.

39:34.289 --> 39:36.082
Just like the majority
of the country.

39:37.876 --> 39:39.543
Oh my god, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

39:39.544 --> 39:41.253
That was really offensive.

39:41.254 --> 39:42.921
- No.
- No no, look.

39:42.922 --> 39:45.549
Like you said,
it's nobody's place to judge.

39:45.550 --> 39:47.134
If you're happy
and living a life,

39:47.135 --> 39:48.553
more power to ya.

39:50.138 --> 39:51.222
I am.

39:52.515 --> 39:53.849
You know, you really
don't have to help

39:53.850 --> 39:55.142
with any of this.

39:55.143 --> 39:56.727
No, please, it's only polite.

39:58.229 --> 40:00.105
Son of a biscuit.

40:00.106 --> 40:01.315
What?

40:01.316 --> 40:02.733
Well, this has been
happening once a week

40:02.734 --> 40:04.568
for what, like, months now.

40:04.569 --> 40:05.903
What's been happening?

40:05.904 --> 40:07.154
Well, I only
drink beer and wine.

40:07.155 --> 40:08.655
I get crazy otherwise.

40:08.656 --> 40:10.282
And Joseph is a
vodka and soda man,

40:10.283 --> 40:11.325
always and forever.

40:11.326 --> 40:12.368
So...

40:12.535 --> 40:14.578
Well, some local
hobo is using our trash

40:14.579 --> 40:16.079
as his drop spot.

40:16.080 --> 40:17.164
I have no idea why...

40:34.724 --> 40:35.850
Hi.

40:38.186 --> 40:40.646
- Did you see the doctor?
- Yes.

40:40.647 --> 40:42.857
Did you or are you lying to me?

40:44.233 --> 40:45.859
Please don't speak
to me like that.

40:48.196 --> 40:51.240
Yes, I saw him.
We talked for a long time.

40:52.742 --> 40:54.701
My session with him
went 40 minutes over,

40:54.702 --> 40:56.119
but he said not
to worry about it,

40:56.120 --> 40:58.122
because I took precedence.

40:58.998 --> 41:01.166
He's a man of faith, Sarah.

41:01.167 --> 41:03.251
Unconventional, there's
no doubt about that,

41:03.252 --> 41:06.088
but very much a believer.

41:10.760 --> 41:13.553
- Is skya already asleep?
- My mother was here.

41:13.554 --> 41:16.139
I asked her to take
her home with her.

41:16.140 --> 41:18.058
Had we discussed
that for tonight?

41:18.059 --> 41:20.352
What sort of ideas
did this man have?

41:22.063 --> 41:23.647
He gave me a prescription.

41:25.441 --> 41:27.067
He told me to try
it for a few weeks,

41:27.068 --> 41:30.404
and if nothing changes
then he had thoughts.

41:31.739 --> 41:33.407
Thoughts you'd like to share?

41:33.408 --> 41:35.534
There's no use in
getting ahead of ourselves.

41:35.535 --> 41:36.827
Until we know more.

41:39.664 --> 41:41.623
He says I'm repressing

41:41.624 --> 41:43.875
in several senses of the word.

41:43.876 --> 41:46.670
King Saul lost three children,

41:48.172 --> 41:51.216
and rather than live with
everything that happened,

41:51.217 --> 41:53.510
everything that was
going to happen...

41:53.511 --> 41:55.095
He fell on his sword.

41:56.389 --> 41:58.598
I want you to
think very carefully

41:58.599 --> 42:00.267
before you say anything else.

42:11.362 --> 42:13.697
I want you to
please explain this.

42:15.324 --> 42:18.035
- Where did that come from?
- Is it yours?

42:18.036 --> 42:19.703
What do you mean is it mine?

42:19.704 --> 42:21.496
I think I was pretty
fucking clear, bram.

42:21.497 --> 42:23.957
- Watch your language.
- Answer the question.

42:26.335 --> 42:28.587
I never bring up the
cigarettes you hide everywhere.

42:30.089 --> 42:32.424
That you think are so secret.

42:32.425 --> 42:33.759
Not once.

42:35.178 --> 42:37.263
'Cause I respect your privacy.

42:38.931 --> 42:40.432
You found that in a trash can?

42:42.226 --> 42:43.477
Somewhere nearby.

42:46.189 --> 42:47.523
And yes.

42:48.775 --> 42:50.109
It is mine.

42:52.570 --> 42:55.739
So what?
What, all of the visions...

42:55.740 --> 42:57.741
- It's not what you think.
- They're all just part of some big-

42:57.742 --> 42:59.118
listen to me!

43:00.369 --> 43:02.621
It's mine, but i
didn't drink any of it.

43:03.539 --> 43:04.873
I never have.

43:05.875 --> 43:07.834
Not once in all of the
months that I've been doing it.

43:07.835 --> 43:09.670
All of the months that
you've been doing what?

43:11.297 --> 43:14.007
This is gonna
sound like a story.

43:14.008 --> 43:16.176
That's why I avoided telling
you in the first place.

43:18.554 --> 43:21.932
I knew it would be difficult
for someone else to understand.

43:23.017 --> 43:25.102
But I have been sober for
more than three months.

43:25.103 --> 43:26.813
That's the god's honest truth.

43:28.022 --> 43:30.941
I chose you and skya
over the bottle, right?

43:31.943 --> 43:33.736
But I don't work
late on Thursdays.

43:34.779 --> 43:36.363
I never have.

43:38.241 --> 43:39.825
Every Thursday night,

43:41.619 --> 43:43.245
since the first
week of my sobriety,

43:44.122 --> 43:45.414
I...

43:49.252 --> 43:50.461
I have a ritual.

43:51.879 --> 43:54.005
A way to prove it to myself.

43:54.006 --> 43:55.257
Prove what?

43:55.258 --> 43:57.426
I go to mark's liquor on ninth.

43:59.345 --> 44:02.014
I buy a 37 ounce
bottle of nu-ball,

44:03.766 --> 44:05.517
and I go to our spot.

44:06.394 --> 44:10.021
On magetto fire road,
and I look out at the city.

44:10.022 --> 44:11.440
The lights.

44:12.358 --> 44:14.109
I think of all the
people unburdened

44:14.110 --> 44:17.196
by my problems,
and I think about all the people

44:17.822 --> 44:20.658
burdened by problems
much worse than mine.

44:24.620 --> 44:27.289
And then I pour out every drop,

44:28.291 --> 44:29.875
and come home.

44:32.128 --> 44:34.546
To prove it to yourself?

44:34.547 --> 44:38.092
To prove that alcohol and i
can exist in the same world.

44:38.593 --> 44:40.177
So why risk it?

44:41.220 --> 44:42.512
Why risk bringing the
bottles back here,

44:42.513 --> 44:44.222
why not just leave them there?

44:44.223 --> 44:45.307
I don't know.

44:47.310 --> 44:48.811
Maybe I didn't wanna litter.

44:50.354 --> 44:52.522
- Is all of this true?
- Every word.

44:54.901 --> 44:56.527
What happens now, bram?

44:58.404 --> 44:59.988
I take the medication.

45:01.532 --> 45:04.993
- See if anything changes.
- And if nothing does?

47:05.489 --> 47:07.532
Right, it's now or never.

47:09.285 --> 47:12.412
Skya's asleep, she's usually
out for a while in the day.

47:12.413 --> 47:14.956
She'll want a bottle
when she wakes up.

47:14.957 --> 47:17.292
Yeah, I know.
I'm smart like that.

47:18.669 --> 47:20.754
I guess I'm in denial.

47:20.921 --> 47:23.590
I'll be back as
soon as I can be.

47:23.591 --> 47:25.258
Be careful.

47:25.259 --> 47:28.136
Daniel thought he saw the
car again this morning.

47:28.137 --> 47:29.512
Bram's?

47:29.513 --> 47:31.556
Yeah, he thought so.

47:42.276 --> 47:44.111
- Sarah.
- Hi Sam.

47:46.447 --> 47:49.532
- You look so different.
- So do you.

47:49.533 --> 47:51.701
Oh, what do you mean?

47:51.702 --> 47:54.830
Oh, no no no. Just, it's been
a lot of years, that's all.

47:59.418 --> 48:00.919
May I come in?

48:02.213 --> 48:06.174
Yes, but um, like I said on
the phone, I'm very busy

48:06.175 --> 48:08.468
so I don't know how
long you can stay.

48:08.469 --> 48:09.654
Look, Sam, I don't
wanna take up any more

48:09.678 --> 48:11.471
of your time than
i have to, so...

48:11.472 --> 48:12.931
You wanna know about Jacob.

48:14.475 --> 48:15.767
Yes.

48:18.270 --> 48:20.814
<i>Jacob hasn't been out
of anti-DC for years.</i>

48:22.525 --> 48:24.192
Doesn't really talk anymore,

48:24.193 --> 48:25.735
not even to me,

48:25.736 --> 48:27.487
but I go there every week,

48:27.488 --> 48:29.740
look after him, look
after this place.

48:30.574 --> 48:34.077
- Those were my mother's wishes.
- I understand.

48:35.413 --> 48:38.249
I guess you remember
that Jacob was weird.

48:38.749 --> 48:40.041
Just antisocial.

48:40.042 --> 48:42.085
We thought low level
asperger's or something,

48:42.086 --> 48:45.172
but nothing that could
ever become dangerous.

48:46.215 --> 48:49.551
But he started to have

48:49.718 --> 48:52.720
outbursts, temper tantrums
he was too old to be having

48:52.721 --> 48:55.682
in places he shouldn't
have been having them.

48:55.683 --> 48:59.018
- Wasn't anyone concerned?
- Of course we were concerned.

48:59.019 --> 49:00.812
But they were having
trouble diagnosing him,

49:00.813 --> 49:02.272
and there'd be long
periods of time

49:02.273 --> 49:03.857
in between episodes, and...

49:05.359 --> 49:06.776
I mean, what were
we supposed to do?

49:06.777 --> 49:08.653
Life goes on.

49:08.654 --> 49:10.613
Are we supposed to
flee to Canada?

49:10.614 --> 49:13.116
Leave him on somebody's
doorstep in a giant basket?

49:14.034 --> 49:15.535
Then one day...

49:16.454 --> 49:17.663
Yeah.

49:19.707 --> 49:23.293
This doesn't mean
anything, you understand.

49:23.961 --> 49:26.921
Bugs under the skin, dissecting
the neighborhood pets.

49:26.922 --> 49:29.007
Crazy has patterns.
Do you understand?

49:29.008 --> 49:31.718
It's always different,
but it's always the same.

49:31.719 --> 49:34.262
I'm just trying to gather
as much information as I can.

49:34.263 --> 49:36.807
Information is fine, just don't
start looking for meaning.

49:39.143 --> 49:42.729
One day Jacob told us that he
was hearing voices in his head

49:42.730 --> 49:44.939
every time he tried
to go to sleep,

49:44.940 --> 49:47.567
so, obviously we all got
on the diagnosis train

49:47.568 --> 49:50.111
in a big way and by that point

49:50.112 --> 49:52.030
it had been going on much
longer than we knew about,

49:52.031 --> 49:54.199
and he was near the edge.

49:54.200 --> 49:57.244
Did he ever tell you what
the voices were saying?

49:59.246 --> 50:01.039
Not at first.
No.

50:02.708 --> 50:05.251
But after, when the
police asked why

50:05.252 --> 50:07.504
he had put the knife
in so many times,

50:07.505 --> 50:09.088
he said it was because
the voice told him

50:09.089 --> 50:11.466
to cut out our mother's heart.

50:16.805 --> 50:19.182
You didn't come here for
any kind of confirmation,

50:19.183 --> 50:22.102
so why don't you just tell me
what you wanna know.

50:22.978 --> 50:25.355
Because the,
the only thing is that...

50:29.485 --> 50:31.361
If you could have done
anything differently,

50:31.362 --> 50:32.863
what would it have been?

50:35.866 --> 50:37.492
I would have had
my brother locked

50:37.493 --> 50:38.743
in the deepest, darkest hole,

50:38.744 --> 50:41.329
and sold the key
for scrap metal,

50:41.330 --> 50:44.207
and if that didn't work,
i would have killed him.

51:00.516 --> 51:01.517
<i>Hey '</i>

51:02.560 --> 51:03.851
if it's another votary

51:03.852 --> 51:05.728
I still don't wanna
talk to anyone.

51:05.729 --> 51:07.605
Daniel has bram on the phone.

51:08.899 --> 51:10.317
<i>Sarah, are you there?</i>

51:12.027 --> 51:13.153
Yeah.

51:13.654 --> 51:14.863
Yeah, I'm here.

51:16.615 --> 51:17.907
How are you?

51:19.368 --> 51:20.494
<i>Oh.</i>

51:21.245 --> 51:22.329
<i>Not good.</i>

51:23.831 --> 51:24.998
<i>Not good at all.</i>

51:26.417 --> 51:27.709
<i>I haven't...</i>

51:28.961 --> 51:31.046
<i>I've just been at home.</i>

51:32.464 --> 51:34.507
<i>Uriel and I both agree
i should...</i>

51:36.635 --> 51:38.219
<i>Take a leave of absence.</i>

51:39.847 --> 51:41.390
Bram, what happened?

51:41.557 --> 51:42.724
Lord god.

51:46.061 --> 51:49.939
We give you thanks for
the joy in the house this day.

51:52.610 --> 51:54.069
Sooner or...

51:54.695 --> 51:56.446
Sooner or later...

51:58.866 --> 52:00.659
We all come to a crossroads.

52:03.245 --> 52:04.955
What we perceive as...

52:07.916 --> 52:09.667
As a moment of crises,

52:10.544 --> 52:13.964
a time that we must choose

52:14.757 --> 52:18.093
between the tangible
something...

52:22.264 --> 52:23.556
And the...

52:26.143 --> 52:27.894
The intangible everything.

52:32.191 --> 52:33.859
Two...

52:39.740 --> 52:43.660
Two impossible choices.

52:51.835 --> 52:53.419
Please!

52:55.506 --> 52:56.673
Please.

53:00.594 --> 53:02.053
Control your child.

53:05.307 --> 53:07.058
That's the problem.

53:09.436 --> 53:11.062
When people can't even...

53:14.233 --> 53:16.693
Don't you understand,
this is difficult?

53:18.404 --> 53:20.030
What I'm doing right now.

53:22.950 --> 53:24.660
Don't any of you
understand that?

53:26.370 --> 53:27.662
Well...

53:29.039 --> 53:30.540
I'd like an answer.

53:33.419 --> 53:34.586
I don't know.

53:35.838 --> 53:37.297
You don't know?

53:39.591 --> 53:41.634
You don't know something
as simple as that?

53:44.430 --> 53:47.933
Well then what are you gonna do
on the day of your reckoning?

53:50.310 --> 53:52.770
The day that
lord god comes to you

53:52.771 --> 53:55.231
and demands of you
the impossible.

53:56.358 --> 53:59.193
The day that the stakes are
higher than you could imagine,

53:59.194 --> 54:02.447
and that doing the right thing
will utterly damn you.

54:04.241 --> 54:05.783
Well!

54:05.784 --> 54:08.495
Bram, please.
Hey, stop, stop.

54:19.006 --> 54:20.632
How are you feeling now?

54:22.176 --> 54:23.760
<i>It's...</i>

54:23.761 --> 54:25.511
<i>It's like a migraine,</i>

54:25.512 --> 54:28.014
<i>but there is a heed.</i>

54:29.224 --> 54:30.725
<i>It's that light, it's,</i>

54:31.685 --> 54:33.645
<i>it's almost every
time I close my eyes.</i>

54:34.730 --> 54:36.064
<i>And the voice.</i>

54:37.107 --> 54:38.983
<i>It's worse than what I see.</i>

54:39.651 --> 54:41.986
<i>The commandment is the same.</i>

54:41.987 --> 54:43.738
<i>Always the same, it's...</i>

54:44.782 --> 54:46.241
<i>It's so loud.</i>

54:47.826 --> 54:52.326
<i>I feel like it could kill me
anytime it wants.</i>

54:53.290 --> 54:55.292
Okay, bram, listen to me.

54:56.251 --> 54:58.211
Have you spoken to Dr. kore?

54:58.962 --> 55:00.672
That was the next step, right?

55:03.008 --> 55:04.425
If this didn't work

55:04.426 --> 55:07.679
he said that, that he had
something you could try.

55:09.640 --> 55:11.516
<i>Something we could try.</i>

55:14.228 --> 55:16.063
<i>I just got off the
phone with him.</i>

55:18.065 --> 55:20.567
<i>He said it's something
we need to be in on together.</i>

55:22.444 --> 55:24.988
You don't have to do anything.

55:28.826 --> 55:30.452
<i>Are you still there?</i>

55:30.994 --> 55:32.245
Yeah.

55:35.290 --> 55:36.749
Where should I meet you?

55:39.837 --> 55:41.755
<i>I'm outside.</i>

56:24.756 --> 56:27.133
I'd like to thank you
both for making the trip.

56:27.759 --> 56:31.471
The office can be so impersonal
for visits like this.

56:32.848 --> 56:34.807
Doctor, excuse me,

56:34.808 --> 56:37.602
I assume bram has
brought you up to speed.

56:37.603 --> 56:38.686
I told him everything.

56:38.687 --> 56:42.273
Oh yes, and it is
a beautiful story.

56:43.191 --> 56:44.734
Pardon me?

56:46.320 --> 56:47.987
Remarkable.

56:47.988 --> 56:49.280
Extraordinary.

56:50.365 --> 56:51.949
I am of a mind that anything

56:51.950 --> 56:54.285
which can be considered truly
remarkable in this world

56:54.286 --> 56:56.287
of quantifiable data,

56:56.288 --> 56:58.164
should be considered beautiful.

56:59.249 --> 57:00.458
Do you not agree?

57:01.585 --> 57:03.002
Wow, look at him.

57:03.003 --> 57:04.503
- Sarah.
- No.

57:04.504 --> 57:06.005
No, no look at him.

57:06.006 --> 57:08.717
I have had to watch him
recognize and then resist,

57:08.926 --> 57:11.135
and then fight tooth and nail
against whatever it is

57:11.136 --> 57:14.639
that is trying it's damnedest
to rip his mind apart.

57:14.640 --> 57:17.183
And you're standing here
telling me that it's beautiful?

57:17.184 --> 57:19.101
No, no no.
Of course not.

57:19.102 --> 57:22.063
Not in the traditional sense.

57:22.856 --> 57:24.357
He said you could help us.

57:26.068 --> 57:27.818
Understand.

57:27.819 --> 57:29.403
I make no promises.

57:30.572 --> 57:32.740
I have prescribed your
husband enough medication

57:32.741 --> 57:36.369
to knock the wren activity out
of a west Indian manatee.

57:36.370 --> 57:37.954
And it's only made things worse.

57:40.040 --> 57:41.791
Which leaves me to believe that

57:41.792 --> 57:44.961
what we are dealing with
is not entirely internal.

57:46.171 --> 57:47.546
What I said from
the beginning was...

57:47.547 --> 57:49.757
What you have said
from the beginning,

57:49.758 --> 57:51.092
as you perceive it,

57:51.093 --> 57:53.970
is that god or something
very much in his image

57:53.971 --> 57:56.222
appeared to you the night of
your daughter's christening,

57:56.223 --> 57:58.557
and almost every
night since then,

57:58.558 --> 58:00.393
commanding you to take her life.

58:01.144 --> 58:03.187
Not unlike the binding of Issac.

58:04.064 --> 58:05.982
- Yes.
- Yes.

58:07.567 --> 58:09.652
I once had a patient who I knew

58:09.653 --> 58:12.113
relatively straight away
was manic depressive.

58:12.114 --> 58:13.990
At first, oh he denied it.

58:13.991 --> 58:15.117
Vehemently.

58:15.283 --> 58:19.161
Delusions of grandeur so
characteristic of the disease.

58:19.162 --> 58:21.372
He was unyielding.

58:22.165 --> 58:25.543
So I invited him here
one evening like this.

58:25.544 --> 58:27.712
I made ajiaco like tonight.

58:28.630 --> 58:31.341
You've both seen that
there is corn in it.

58:32.092 --> 58:34.343
I'm sorry, what are
you talking about?

58:34.344 --> 58:35.845
By the time we
were ready to eat,

58:35.846 --> 58:37.264
he had withdrawn.

58:38.473 --> 58:40.683
He refused to make conversation.

58:40.684 --> 58:44.396
So, I made a little remark
about where I'd got the corn.

58:44.938 --> 58:48.024
At a farmer's market.
And do you know what he said?

58:51.403 --> 58:52.445
No.

58:54.990 --> 58:57.241
No, you didn't get it there?

58:57.242 --> 58:58.493
No.

58:58.660 --> 59:00.828
To the corn in it's entirety.

59:00.829 --> 59:02.955
There's no corn in this he said.

59:02.956 --> 59:05.166
Spooning the corn
into his mouth.

59:05.333 --> 59:07.626
There was no change
in his demeanor.

59:07.627 --> 59:10.671
He wasn't having an episode
or anything of that nature.

59:10.672 --> 59:13.716
So, I slowly encouraged
him to explain himself.

59:13.884 --> 59:17.094
He said, he had seen
the jar on the counter,

59:17.095 --> 59:19.680
and the label had
said capers, so clearly

59:19.681 --> 59:21.766
this was not corn.

59:22.851 --> 59:24.310
Can you imagine?

59:25.353 --> 59:27.521
I think what Sarah meant was...

59:27.522 --> 59:29.357
Would you help me serve?
Please.

01:00:01.389 --> 01:00:03.015
It's very good.

01:00:03.391 --> 01:00:05.643
Great. I'm glad.

01:00:09.564 --> 01:00:11.816
You should see if you can try
to get some of this down.

01:00:12.526 --> 01:00:14.527
I think you'd like it.

01:00:14.528 --> 01:00:16.905
- It has potatoes.
- What is this?

01:00:17.823 --> 01:00:19.615
Are you messing with
us or something?

01:00:19.616 --> 01:00:21.242
Why did you bring us here?

01:00:23.078 --> 01:00:26.288
I thought we would enjoy
our dinner first, bram.

01:00:26.289 --> 01:00:28.624
Well, excuse me if I have
other things on my mind.

01:00:30.001 --> 01:00:32.169
Can you help us or not?

01:00:32.170 --> 01:00:33.254
What?

01:00:33.255 --> 01:00:35.382
What was that about
all your other patient?

01:00:37.425 --> 01:00:40.636
He had seen the capers,
and he had seen the corn,

01:00:40.637 --> 01:00:43.556
and his mind was not in a
place to differentiate the two.

01:00:44.516 --> 01:00:48.435
You are visited by a
creature calling itself god,

01:00:48.436 --> 01:00:50.771
and all that you have allowed
yourself to do in response

01:00:50.772 --> 01:00:53.023
is to discern whether
those visitations are real

01:00:53.024 --> 01:00:54.775
or imagined.

01:00:55.318 --> 01:00:58.404
Is there anything incorrect
in what I'm saying?

01:00:58.405 --> 01:00:59.530
No.

01:00:59.531 --> 01:01:01.866
Real, imagined.

01:01:02.492 --> 01:01:03.659
Two options.

01:01:04.744 --> 01:01:06.620
But, as I see it,

01:01:06.621 --> 01:01:08.247
strictly according to the data,

01:01:08.248 --> 01:01:09.874
there is a third option,

01:01:09.875 --> 01:01:12.209
an option which you have
yet to fully explore,

01:01:12.210 --> 01:01:14.003
an option which in my opinion

01:01:14.004 --> 01:01:16.589
as a man of faith
and a man of medicine

01:01:16.590 --> 01:01:20.385
potentially holds the most
validity of all three.

01:01:22.679 --> 01:01:23.930
Which is what?

01:01:25.974 --> 01:01:29.102
That you are indeed
commanded by a spirit.

01:01:29.853 --> 01:01:31.396
A supernatural being.

01:01:32.189 --> 01:01:33.522
But not the heavenly father.

01:01:33.523 --> 01:01:36.692
Not our god who art in heaven.
Something else.

01:01:38.069 --> 01:01:41.405
You described this being
as enveloped in light, did you not?

01:01:42.199 --> 01:01:45.285
Well then, don't see
what you believe.

01:01:46.244 --> 01:01:48.204
See what you see.

01:01:49.331 --> 01:01:52.792
Morning star, light bringer.

01:01:55.503 --> 01:01:56.962
Lucifer.

01:02:01.968 --> 01:02:03.344
<i>Sarah, you'll be happy to know</i>

01:02:03.345 --> 01:02:05.804
<i>that I've consulted the
district superintendent.</i>

01:02:05.805 --> 01:02:07.389
<i>Okay.</i>

01:02:07.390 --> 01:02:09.350
<i>One of the ways in
which Christ's ministry</i>

01:02:09.351 --> 01:02:11.852
<i>is continued
throughout the world.</i>

01:02:11.853 --> 01:02:13.562
<i>His words.</i>

01:02:13.563 --> 01:02:15.356
<i>Okay, so...</i>

01:02:15.523 --> 01:02:16.857
<i>Yes.</i>

01:02:16.858 --> 01:02:19.610
<i>Yes, authority has been given.</i>

01:03:05.949 --> 01:03:10.449
Bramwell, the presence and love

01:03:10.453 --> 01:03:12.079
of Jesus Christ

01:03:13.039 --> 01:03:14.498
is here today.

01:03:15.875 --> 01:03:17.751
Do you accept this?

01:03:20.588 --> 01:03:22.381
We ask you, Jesus,

01:03:22.382 --> 01:03:25.342
cast out any and all spirits

01:03:25.343 --> 01:03:28.888
within or near bramwell eyman.

01:03:29.973 --> 01:03:31.724
Cast them out, Jesus.

01:03:33.184 --> 01:03:35.769
Cast out the evil spirits.

01:03:35.770 --> 01:03:37.021
Praise the lord.

01:03:38.356 --> 01:03:40.649
Leave this man now.

01:03:40.650 --> 01:03:42.526
Cast out the searing
and profane light

01:03:42.527 --> 01:03:45.404
this spirit has shown upon him.

01:03:45.572 --> 01:03:48.783
Pray with me.
Pray with me, bramwell.

01:03:49.743 --> 01:03:51.618
Cast them out, lord.

01:03:51.619 --> 01:03:53.662
Cast these spirits out.

01:03:53.663 --> 01:03:54.830
Cast them out.

01:03:54.831 --> 01:03:56.499
Cast them out.

01:03:57.083 --> 01:04:00.753
I command you in the
name of Jesus Christ.

01:04:00.754 --> 01:04:04.132
Leave bramwell eyman.

01:04:04.841 --> 01:04:06.259
Leave him!

01:04:13.516 --> 01:04:17.353
Cast out all evil spirits
attached to bramwell eyman.

01:04:18.813 --> 01:04:22.817
We pray you cast the evil
spirits from this man.

01:04:23.360 --> 01:04:25.361
Free bramwell.

01:04:25.362 --> 01:04:26.695
Free him.

01:04:26.696 --> 01:04:30.700
Leave bramwell's body,
and never return.

01:04:31.701 --> 01:04:33.327
Never return.

01:04:34.537 --> 01:04:35.829
Amen!

01:05:13.535 --> 01:05:14.994
Bramwell.

01:05:16.871 --> 01:05:18.581
How do you feel?

01:05:23.128 --> 01:05:24.587
Empty.

01:05:27.048 --> 01:05:28.716
I feel nothing.

01:05:29.759 --> 01:05:32.720
- Is that how you've been feeling?
- No.

01:05:33.847 --> 01:05:37.016
- Anything but.
- So there you are.

01:05:39.436 --> 01:05:41.146
Of course we'll have
to keep an eye on you.

01:05:42.730 --> 01:05:45.274
But I think we've
broken back this thing.

01:05:47.068 --> 01:05:48.277
Yes.

01:05:49.737 --> 01:05:51.572
Yes, oughta be so.

01:05:55.243 --> 01:05:56.577
Please god.

01:05:59.122 --> 01:06:00.998
Let it be so.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:03.292
Minister.

01:06:05.420 --> 01:06:08.005
Now Sarah, if you really
didn't like the gift I got ya,

01:06:08.006 --> 01:06:09.798
you could've put it on ebay.

01:06:09.799 --> 01:06:11.467
Just tell me.

01:06:11.468 --> 01:06:13.594
Do you truly believe?

01:06:13.595 --> 01:06:15.680
Is it over or not?

01:06:17.724 --> 01:06:18.808
Yes.

01:06:22.270 --> 01:06:24.813
You have to believe
that it's over, Sarah.

01:06:24.814 --> 01:06:27.691
Just as bram has to
believe it's over.

01:06:27.692 --> 01:06:29.568
It was the seeds of doubt

01:06:29.569 --> 01:06:31.320
that began all this.

01:06:33.448 --> 01:06:35.365
Now you put this behind
you, and move on.

01:06:35.366 --> 01:06:36.533
Utterly.

01:06:37.160 --> 01:06:38.703
And it will be over.

01:06:43.666 --> 01:06:46.168
Jesus resisted the
devil three times.

01:06:46.169 --> 01:06:49.005
You and your husband
have done that and more.

01:06:50.882 --> 01:06:52.883
Keep yourself free from sin

01:06:52.884 --> 01:06:55.344
and the devil will
have no foothold.

01:06:59.641 --> 01:07:03.728
But, if you feel that
skya's in real danger,

01:07:05.855 --> 01:07:07.273
call the police.

01:07:20.787 --> 01:07:22.120
God will not suffer
you to be tempted

01:07:22.121 --> 01:07:24.331
above that ye are able,

01:07:24.332 --> 01:07:26.375
but will with that temptation

01:07:27.335 --> 01:07:29.337
make a way for you to escape.

01:07:31.422 --> 01:07:33.590
That ye shall be
able to bear it.

01:07:40.515 --> 01:07:42.225
I wonder if we've escaped.

01:07:45.603 --> 01:07:46.979
We have.

01:07:47.814 --> 01:07:49.315
Of course we have.

01:07:50.233 --> 01:07:51.651
What happens now?

01:07:54.153 --> 01:07:56.238
I'd like to keep
things the way they are.

01:07:56.906 --> 01:07:58.532
Just for a little longer.

01:08:00.702 --> 01:08:05.202
When some time passes
and you're still feeling better,

01:08:05.248 --> 01:08:07.541
then we can discuss
being together again.

01:08:08.501 --> 01:08:09.752
All of us.

01:08:11.254 --> 01:08:12.755
I'd like that, Sarah.

01:08:14.841 --> 01:08:16.634
I'd like that very much.

01:08:20.638 --> 01:08:21.805
I love you.

01:08:29.856 --> 01:08:32.189
I just want you to
be absolutely sure,

01:08:32.191 --> 01:08:33.817
that's all I'm trying to say.

01:08:33.818 --> 01:08:35.234
I'm as sure as I can be, mom.

01:08:35.236 --> 01:08:36.612
You think that's enough?

01:08:36.613 --> 01:08:38.947
It's gonna have to be.

01:08:38.948 --> 01:08:41.158
It's been more than a month

01:08:41.158 --> 01:08:43.910
since bram has had
any kind of episode.

01:08:43.911 --> 01:08:45.996
He's back at the church.

01:08:45.997 --> 01:08:48.124
And our nights alone at
the house have been fine.

01:08:49.500 --> 01:08:51.001
Fine.

01:08:51.002 --> 01:08:52.669
Better than fine.

01:08:52.670 --> 01:08:54.337
He's sleeping like a log.

01:08:54.339 --> 01:08:55.796
He's gotten up two,
three times a night

01:08:55.798 --> 01:08:57.883
as long as I've known him,
but for the past few weeks

01:08:57.884 --> 01:08:59.051
he's slept straight through

01:08:59.218 --> 01:09:02.011
until seven or eight
in the morning.

01:09:02.013 --> 01:09:04.432
He says he hasn't done that
since he was a teenager.

01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:07.142
All right.

01:09:07.143 --> 01:09:10.437
I mean, what more can
he have us do right?

01:09:10.438 --> 01:09:11.979
Right.

01:09:11.981 --> 01:09:13.107
That's where I am.

01:09:17.862 --> 01:09:19.571
Hey, could you grab those?

01:09:19.572 --> 01:09:22.032
I think once we toss that out
in the bag that's everything.

01:09:22.033 --> 01:09:24.826
If there's absolutely
anything that you think i-

01:09:24.827 --> 01:09:26.536
thank you, but,

01:09:26.537 --> 01:09:28.747
we have to start getting
on with our life.

01:09:29.999 --> 01:09:33.002
And, first step
just has to happen.

01:09:45.682 --> 01:09:46.724
Hi.

01:09:47.684 --> 01:09:48.768
Hi.

01:09:55.525 --> 01:09:56.734
One more?

01:10:22.677 --> 01:10:23.969
<i>Hey '</i>

01:10:24.971 --> 01:10:26.973
I'm sorry, I have
another favor to ask.

01:10:29.851 --> 01:10:31.184
It's just...

01:10:31.185 --> 01:10:33.270
I mean, it's our
first night back,

01:10:33.271 --> 01:10:35.522
and I'm so happy to have
us all together again.

01:10:35.523 --> 01:10:36.774
I just...

01:10:38.025 --> 01:10:39.693
Well, if not for my own...

01:10:39.694 --> 01:10:41.821
You want skya to sleep with you.

01:10:43.197 --> 01:10:45.198
Alone, just the two of you.

01:10:45.199 --> 01:10:46.575
Is that awful?

01:10:46.576 --> 01:10:49.161
No. Not at all.

01:10:51.247 --> 01:10:52.623
Baby steps, right?

01:10:53.791 --> 01:10:54.958
Right.

01:11:11.267 --> 01:11:13.185
Once upon a time,

01:11:13.186 --> 01:11:16.522
god almighty appeared
under one of the chosen

01:11:18.441 --> 01:11:21.944
and commanded that he slay
his own flesh and blood.

01:11:28.951 --> 01:11:30.869
Perhaps that time
has come again.

01:11:40.713 --> 01:11:42.089
I figured it out, Sarah.

01:11:43.549 --> 01:11:45.717
What he's been asking me.

01:11:45.718 --> 01:11:46.927
All this time.

01:11:48.054 --> 01:11:49.430
Everyone had it wrong.

01:11:52.558 --> 01:11:55.561
I just need a little
time with our daughter.

01:11:56.395 --> 01:11:57.813
Hey. Hey-

01:11:58.648 --> 01:11:59.899
listen.

01:12:00.691 --> 01:12:02.025
Listen to me.

01:12:04.278 --> 01:12:06.196
I don't wanna hurt anybody.

01:12:07.573 --> 01:12:10.492
But I will do what I must.

01:12:11.911 --> 01:12:14.079
Do you understand me?

01:12:16.958 --> 01:12:18.751
There's only one option left.

01:12:20.586 --> 01:12:23.755
And I can't let you stop me.

01:12:26.008 --> 01:12:28.176
I'm gonna put tape
over your mouth,

01:12:28.177 --> 01:12:30.971
and lock you in the garage.

01:12:30.972 --> 01:12:32.139
Then...

01:12:33.140 --> 01:12:35.684
Everything will be finished.

01:12:37.103 --> 01:12:39.396
Only it'll be real this time.

01:12:43.776 --> 01:12:46.236
Are you going to behave?

01:12:53.119 --> 01:12:54.286
Don't.

01:12:55.121 --> 01:12:57.456
Don't be like that, Sarah.

01:12:59.125 --> 01:13:00.668
The visions never stopped.

01:13:01.460 --> 01:13:04.629
Call them whatever you want,
but that's what they are.

01:13:04.630 --> 01:13:05.881
Visions.

01:13:07.216 --> 01:13:09.009
Darkness.

01:13:09.010 --> 01:13:11.887
Closer and closer and closer,

01:13:11.888 --> 01:13:13.471
swallowing everything.

01:13:13.472 --> 01:13:15.557
He showed me until I obeyed.

01:13:17.602 --> 01:13:20.438
He wanted the three
of us as a family

01:13:20.605 --> 01:13:23.107
under one roof, and
i did as he said.

01:13:25.067 --> 01:13:27.027
Now, Sarah...

01:13:29.030 --> 01:13:33.530
Are you going to
behave yourself?

01:13:39.540 --> 01:13:40.791
Come with me.

01:13:43.085 --> 01:13:44.836
We're going straight
to the garage.

01:13:47.173 --> 01:13:48.424
Keep walking straight.

01:13:49.383 --> 01:13:52.010
All of the doors are locked,
the phones are gone.

01:13:53.137 --> 01:13:54.471
So please.

01:13:56.265 --> 01:13:57.432
Walk.

01:14:03.606 --> 01:14:04.940
You said.

01:14:05.900 --> 01:14:07.233
You said that you
know what everybody's

01:14:07.234 --> 01:14:09.194
been asking you to do.

01:14:10.446 --> 01:14:12.531
After Dr. kore misdiagnosed,

01:14:13.866 --> 01:14:15.325
after Uriel failed,

01:14:17.453 --> 01:14:19.621
I turned to the good book.

01:14:20.831 --> 01:14:23.208
I knew that there was
something I must have missed.

01:14:25.127 --> 01:14:29.005
And then after several clays

01:14:30.508 --> 01:14:32.009
I found it.

01:14:33.511 --> 01:14:35.804
It had been staring
us in the face

01:14:35.805 --> 01:14:38.974
only no one had the
good sense to see it.

01:14:41.227 --> 01:14:44.229
When god commanded Abraham

01:14:44.230 --> 01:14:46.982
to sacrifice his child,

01:14:46.983 --> 01:14:48.733
god needed only to see

01:14:48.734 --> 01:14:50.944
that his devotion was absolute.

01:14:52.905 --> 01:14:54.990
And he was pardoned.

01:14:54.991 --> 01:14:57.326
That was his
spiritual surrender.

01:14:59.286 --> 01:15:00.912
Don't you see, Sarah?

01:15:02.081 --> 01:15:05.000
You don't need to
hurt our daughter.

01:15:05.001 --> 01:15:07.336
But I must be
absolutely prepared to.

01:15:09.296 --> 01:15:13.049
Mind, body and spirit.

01:15:15.553 --> 01:15:17.804
I must proceed with the binding,

01:15:17.805 --> 01:15:21.433
knowing that there
is no other way.

01:15:22.268 --> 01:15:26.730
Then, and only then,

01:15:27.231 --> 01:15:30.275
will an angel of
god stain my hand.

01:15:32.236 --> 01:15:33.779
I'm sorry, bram.

01:15:34.739 --> 01:15:36.991
But that's just not good enough.

01:17:17.925 --> 01:17:21.302
Whoever welcomes one
such child in my name,

01:17:21.303 --> 01:17:23.388
welcomes me.

01:17:23.389 --> 01:17:24.556
No.

01:17:24.557 --> 01:17:26.224
No.

01:17:26.225 --> 01:17:27.976
No no no.

01:18:13.606 --> 01:18:15.357
There was nothing.

01:18:17.318 --> 01:18:18.736
He never came.

01:18:23.741 --> 01:18:25.492
No! No!

01:18:25.701 --> 01:18:26.993
No!

01:18:27.786 --> 01:18:29.412
No!

01:18:29.413 --> 01:18:30.956
No!

01:19:25.427 --> 01:19:27.553
It's okay.

01:19:27.554 --> 01:19:30.139
It's okay, mommy's here.

01:19:30.140 --> 01:19:31.808
I'm not gonna leave you.

01:19:33.560 --> 01:19:35.603
It's over now.

01:19:35.604 --> 01:19:36.855
It's over now.

01:20:00.212 --> 01:20:03.131
Sarah, I'm sorry to
just show up like this,

01:20:03.132 --> 01:20:06.384
but I thought maybe
i should check in.

01:20:06.385 --> 01:20:08.094
No, that's fine.

01:20:08.095 --> 01:20:10.055
I actually just put
skya down for her nap.

01:20:17.563 --> 01:20:19.230
It keeps coming back to me,

01:20:19.231 --> 01:20:21.311
whether or not I could have
done something different.

01:20:23.235 --> 01:20:25.153
I thought it was your crucifix.

01:20:26.655 --> 01:20:29.282
The voice of the
holy spirit somehow

01:20:30.159 --> 01:20:31.869
linked to everything.

01:20:32.453 --> 01:20:34.580
Then I realized I was crazy.

01:20:38.042 --> 01:20:40.460
Well, you know, sometimes things
aren't always clear

01:20:40.461 --> 01:20:42.211
while they're happening.

01:20:42.212 --> 01:20:45.173
I'm learning sometimes
things aren't clear, period.

01:20:47.384 --> 01:20:48.676
The gun.

01:20:49.720 --> 01:20:52.222
Our gun, the one he used
to threaten me with.

01:20:52.806 --> 01:20:54.682
To get me out of the room.

01:20:55.934 --> 01:20:57.560
Wasn't loaded.

01:21:03.108 --> 01:21:04.400
Good coffee.

01:21:05.778 --> 01:21:07.905
It's imported I think.

01:21:13.243 --> 01:21:17.743
Sarah, the last thing on
earth I wanna do right now

01:21:17.748 --> 01:21:19.123
is lecture you, but...

01:21:19.124 --> 01:21:20.875
Then don't.

01:21:28.258 --> 01:21:29.884
My father was a hard man.

01:21:31.095 --> 01:21:32.805
Times were different then.

01:21:33.472 --> 01:21:36.683
When I was eight years old,
one day I came home from school

01:21:36.850 --> 01:21:39.102
and I couldn't find
my roller skates.

01:21:39.103 --> 01:21:40.395
They were only the
most important thing

01:21:40.396 --> 01:21:41.646
in the world to me,

01:21:41.647 --> 01:21:44.482
so I asked him if he
knew where they were,

01:21:44.483 --> 01:21:47.652
and without looking
up from his newspaper

01:21:47.653 --> 01:21:49.696
he told me he'd thrown 'em out.

01:21:50.614 --> 01:21:53.533
No explanation.
No reason at all. Just...

01:21:55.911 --> 01:21:58.079
Well, as you could
imagine, I was shocked.

01:22:00.833 --> 01:22:02.292
Confused.

01:22:03.252 --> 01:22:04.961
But ours wasn't the
kind of household

01:22:04.962 --> 01:22:09.257
where you ask questions
or talked back, so,

01:22:09.258 --> 01:22:12.511
I went to my room and i
shouted into my pillow.

01:22:15.222 --> 01:22:18.224
I was angry and confused,

01:22:18.225 --> 01:22:21.603
and I chose to stay angry
and confused for a long time.

01:22:24.022 --> 01:22:26.774
Long after I'd become a man,

01:22:26.775 --> 01:22:29.610
after he had passed away.

01:22:29.611 --> 01:22:31.779
And it became a kind
of story, you know.

01:22:32.698 --> 01:22:34.825
My father, that old so and so.

01:22:34.992 --> 01:22:37.995
You know what he did to me
when I was just a kid?

01:22:39.121 --> 01:22:42.415
And one day I was telling
that story to friends,

01:22:43.584 --> 01:22:46.587
and I, uh, finished

01:22:47.379 --> 01:22:50.298
with my usual flourish
of incredulity,

01:22:50.299 --> 01:22:54.799
and waited for the
chorus of sympathy,

01:22:57.264 --> 01:23:01.017
and a man at the
far end of the table

01:23:01.768 --> 01:23:04.562
asked me when did this happen.

01:23:04.563 --> 01:23:07.690
And I told him the year,
and he pulled up his pants leg

01:23:07.691 --> 01:23:10.193
and he showed me a scar
like you would not believe.

01:23:12.112 --> 01:23:15.698
Those skates had been
recalled that year

01:23:15.699 --> 01:23:18.159
because they had faulty wheels.

01:23:19.870 --> 01:23:21.788
My father never told me that.

01:23:23.832 --> 01:23:27.961
He did what was in
my best interest and he knew it.

01:23:30.506 --> 01:23:31.924
And that was enough.
