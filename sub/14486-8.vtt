Maybe if I hug him
real hard,

14:11.985 --> 14:14.053
he'll save us from--

[ Screaming ]

14:17.124 --> 14:19.392
Oh, it tickles!
[ Laughing ]

Oh, uh--
[ Continues Laughing ]
Aw, oh.

14:27.567 --> 14:30.136
[ Bender ]
Hello? Is anyone still alive?

14:30.236 --> 14:33.405
How 'bout
in the porno theater?

14:33.505 --> 14:38.544
Don't be embarrassed.
[ Gasps ] They're dead.

14:38.644 --> 14:42.282
All dead! Who would
have known playing God...

14:42.381 --> 14:44.884
could have such
terrible consequences?

14:44.985 --> 14:49.322
[ Sobbing ]

14:49.422 --> 14:52.491
[ Wind Roaring ]
[ Braying ]

14:52.591 --> 14:55.327
Fry! If I drop dead
from exhaustion,

14:55.427 --> 14:58.565
make sure my body freezes
in a dignified position!

14:58.664 --> 15:01.168
None of that "huddled over
for warmth" crap.

[ Grunting, Panting ]

15:04.370 --> 15:06.273
[ Gasping ]
Behold!

15:06.373 --> 15:08.975
The Monastery of Deshuba.

15:09.076 --> 15:12.678
I must leave you now,
for I am not holy enough
to enter.

15:12.778 --> 15:14.614
Okay.
[ Belches, Spits ]

15:19.986 --> 15:22.654
Looks rickety.
We better test it.

15:23.655 --> 15:25.758
[ Slaps ]
[ Brays ]

15:27.860 --> 15:29.828
[ Motor Humming ]

15:29.928 --> 15:32.198
[ Woman's Recorded Voice ]
Welcome to our monastery.

15:32.298 --> 15:35.934
Please stand to one side
to let faster pilgrims by.

15:48.380 --> 15:52.152
Hey! That galaxy's
signaling in binary!

15:52.251 --> 15:56.889
I gotta signal back!
But I only know enough binary
to ask where the bathroom is.

15:56.990 --> 16:00.159
- You speak English?
- [ Deep, Male Voice ]
I do now.

16:00.259 --> 16:02.662
Whoa-whoa, whoa!

16:02.761 --> 16:06.666
[ Whimpering ]
Oh.

16:06.765 --> 16:09.168
What are you?
Some kind of
galactic computer?

16:09.269 --> 16:13.340
Possible.
I am user-friendly,
my good chum.

16:13.440 --> 16:16.509
Who built you?
I have always been.

16:16.609 --> 16:20.379
Oh, my God!
Are you... God?

16:20.480 --> 16:24.150
Possible. I do
feel compassion for
all living things--

16:24.250 --> 16:28.721
my good chum.
But why would God
think in binary?

16:28.821 --> 16:31.423
Unless... you're not God,

16:31.524 --> 16:34.427
but the remains of
a computerized space probe...

16:34.527 --> 16:37.864
that collided with God!
That seems probable.

[ Motor Grinding ]

[ Electronic Twittering ]
A member of
our brotherhood...

16:43.602 --> 16:46.505
sits at these controls
every hour of every day,

16:46.605 --> 16:48.508
scanning the heavens
for God.

16:48.607 --> 16:51.177
[ Buzzing ]
There he is!

16:51.278 --> 16:53.179
No. No, wait. No.

16:53.279 --> 16:56.883
- How long have you been at it?
- 700 years.

16:56.982 --> 17:00.352
We've not yet examined
one ten-millionth of the sky.

17:00.452 --> 17:02.788
But we will go on until
we find the Almighty.

17:02.889 --> 17:04.790
Even if it takes
to the end of time.

17:04.891 --> 17:08.560
- And then what?
- Then, we utter unto him
a short prayer.

17:08.661 --> 17:12.199
You see, the telescope is
also an amplifying transmitter.

17:12.298 --> 17:14.467
Sorta like a giant
karaoke machine?

17:14.567 --> 17:17.470
Not really.
Would you like to see our
giant karaoke machine?

17:17.569 --> 17:19.971
Not really.

17:20.073 --> 17:22.974
Mm. Finding God,
that's important, yeah.

17:23.076 --> 17:24.977
But you know what might be
a treat for everyone?

17:25.077 --> 17:27.279
If you let me use the telescope
to find my lost friend, Bender.

17:27.380 --> 17:29.548
I-I don't know
what to say.

17:29.648 --> 17:31.718
Other than,
"Absolutely not."

Your loss is a tragedy,
but our work--

Ah! Come on!
You guys have forever
to look for God.

17:36.489 --> 17:39.925
All I'm asking is
one measly lifetime
to find my friend!

17:40.026 --> 17:42.461
He speaks out of love
for his friend.

17:42.561 --> 17:45.298
Perhaps that love
in his heart... is God.

17:45.397 --> 17:48.468
Oh, how convenient.
A theory about God...

17:48.567 --> 17:50.737
that doesn't
require looking
through a telescope.

17:50.836 --> 17:54.641
- Get back to work!
- That telescope is as much
mine as anybody's.

17:54.740 --> 17:57.109

give me permission or not.

Hy-ahh! Your order may be
famous for your martial arts,

18:03.516 --> 18:06.118
but I've never met a holy man
I couldn't clobber!

18:06.219 --> 18:09.922
Actually, we only
practice martial arts as
a form of meditation.

We are a strictly
nonviolent sect.

in the laundry room,
or I'll kick your butts!

crazy sect I've ever been in.

So, do you know what I'm
gonna do before I do it?

18:25.738 --> 18:28.441
- Yes.
- What if I do
something different?

18:28.540 --> 18:31.810
Then I don't know that.
Cool! Cool.

I bet a lot of people
pray to you, huh?

18:33.913 --> 18:37.349
[ Sighs ] Yes, but there
are so many, asking so much.

18:37.450 --> 18:39.986
After a while, you just
sort of tune it out.

- You know, I was God once.
- Yes, I saw.

until everyone died.

It was awful.
I tried helping them.

I tried not helping them.
But in the end, I couldn't
do them any good.

18:53.665 --> 18:55.634
Do you think
what I did was wrong?

18:55.734 --> 18:59.672
Right and wrong are just words.
What matters is what you do.

18:59.771 --> 19:03.210
Yeah, I know. That's why
I asked if what I did--

Oh, forget it!
Bender,
being God isn't easy.

19:07.314 --> 19:10.182
If you do too much,
people get dependent on you.

19:10.282 --> 19:12.551
And if you do nothing,
they lose hope.

19:12.652 --> 19:14.554
You have to use
a light touch--

19:14.653 --> 19:16.888
like a safecracker,
or a pickpocket.

Or a guy who burns down
a bar for the insurance money!

Yes, if you make it look
like an electrical thing.

When you do things right,
people won't be sure
you've done anything at all.

Does that mean you wouldn't
send me back to Earth?

the rest of your life,

there is virtually
no chance of finding him.

that has ever happened.

believe what happened!

I'm sure their God
will let them out.

Or at least give them
more shoes to eat.
Fat chance!

You can't count on God
for jack!

21:28.988 --> 21:30.890

told me so himself.
