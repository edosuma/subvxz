WEBVTT

01:01.128 --> 01:02.363
Deja vu ?

01:02.428 --> 01:04.174
Don't even think about it.

01:04.589 --> 01:06.400
- What do we got ?
- Gator...

01:07.595 --> 01:08.959
found himself some lunch.

01:10.389 --> 01:11.673
Where's the crime ?

01:11.836 --> 01:13.443
Gator had him on his back before.

01:13.494 --> 01:16.177
Saw pellets from a shotgun wound.
Called you guys.

01:16.607 --> 01:20.060
Forensically, the head yields
the most information. I'd hate to lose it.

01:20.134 --> 01:22.888
- We'll take care of the gator.
- We'll take care of the body.

01:53.933 --> 01:56.285
Be easier to carry the body to the van

01:56.805 --> 01:58.625
than try to get a gurney down here.

01:58.785 --> 02:00.165
We'll help you carry him.

02:00.815 --> 02:02.205
I'll search the crime scene.

02:02.638 --> 02:04.640
How far do you think the gator
could've dragged him ?

02:04.654 --> 02:06.110
Probably not more than 200 feet.

02:10.263 --> 02:11.527
It's a dry lightning storm.

02:11.575 --> 02:12.871
Lightning with no rain,

02:13.599 --> 02:14.895
that's the worst kind.

02:15.007 --> 02:16.223
Oh, no.

02:16.879 --> 02:18.889
Relax. It's not going
to happen again.

02:19.257 --> 02:20.521
Don't tell me.

02:26.746 --> 02:28.010
Oh, my God.

02:29.082 --> 02:30.698
Let's get the body out of here.

02:33.426 --> 02:35.210
Start the engine. Let's go !

02:35.251 --> 02:36.435
It won't turn over.

02:38.739 --> 02:40.467
We're surrounded.

02:41.772 --> 02:46.196
Let's get out of here !
We've got to go through.
Get down ! Go. Let's go ! Let's go !

04:22.000 --> 04:23.920
You met our shotgun victim.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.152
You okay ?

04:27.344 --> 04:29.648
Gotta quit doing these
Glade runs, Horatio.

04:29.808 --> 04:31.232
You want me to call for some help ?

04:31.314 --> 04:32.930
No, it's my case. I'll get him.

04:34.930 --> 04:35.538
Eric...

04:35.570 --> 04:38.354
It's going to be tough to
determine were this guy was shot.

04:38.802 --> 04:40.770
Dispatch said an explosion.

04:41.578 --> 04:42.938
The lightning hit something.

04:42.986 --> 04:44.134
Fire chased us out.

04:44.154 --> 04:47.443
Could be an accelerant.
Heavier fumes lie close the ground.

04:48.243 --> 04:49.971
One spark, the whole thing burns.

04:50.067 --> 04:52.213
It can cover a large area
in a matter of seconds.

04:54.981 --> 04:58.277
We better find this crime scene quick
before we get kicked out of here.

04:58.421 --> 04:59.861
Don't we have jurisdiction ?

05:00.229 --> 05:01.589
Conditions like this,

05:01.989 --> 05:03.694
the only one with jurisdiction...

05:04.839 --> 05:05.863
is the fire.

05:15.919 --> 05:17.730
According to your own guy,
the crime scene burned.

05:17.762 --> 05:21.378
Chief, you and I both know
that fire does not destroy all evidence.

05:21.474 --> 05:22.855
We've got a major wildfire here.

05:22.882 --> 05:25.234
- It's extremely dangerous.
- A man has been shot out here.

05:25.250 --> 05:27.242
If I don't process this crime scene immediately,

05:27.274 --> 05:29.210
somebody's gonna get away with murder.

05:32.002 --> 05:34.018
I can't be held responsible
for your personnel.

05:34.044 --> 05:35.340
Leave that to me.

05:55.855 --> 05:57.407
I heard you wrestled a gator.

05:57.855 --> 05:59.103
No, not me.

05:59.423 --> 06:00.687
Fish and Wildlife.

06:01.983 --> 06:03.247
There's a jail bus.

06:04.616 --> 06:06.136
When fire gets beyond available means,

06:06.152 --> 06:08.392
they have a mutual aid agreement
with Dade County.

06:08.424 --> 06:10.824
Using inmates to fight
fire ? Is that wise ?

06:10.962 --> 06:11.946
It's manpower.

06:12.066 --> 06:14.580
That's what they need right now.
Get out of here.

06:14.638 --> 06:16.588
Oh, come on. I always
get your good side, Delko.

06:16.610 --> 06:20.518
Yeah. Last time you filmed me, I ended up on
the 6:00 news. It looked like I was smiling.

06:20.562 --> 06:22.346
We're gonna need you
to go back to the media area.

06:22.386 --> 06:25.466
Oh, come on. I'm just trying
to get some exclusive footage.

06:25.508 --> 06:27.940
You've only got clearance
for the media area.

06:28.004 --> 06:29.360
You can make an exception.

06:29.412 --> 06:31.284
Forget  it. Let's go. Get out of here.

06:40.182 --> 06:44.032
This is the fire detail. Prepare to line up.
Come on. Move it. Let's go.

06:59.465 --> 07:02.754
Well, check out the hoods
in the woods.

07:05.713 --> 07:07.610
How'd you get on
the orange crew, huh?

07:08.964 --> 07:11.003
Perform some sexual favors?

07:16.401 --> 07:16.970
Hey!

07:17.605 --> 07:18.065
Hey.

07:22.026 --> 07:24.115
Now, you're supposed to be
on the same side.

07:24.156 --> 07:26.037
Oh, not if you ask me.

07:26.090 --> 07:29.196
- I need you to back off.
- You got this is all backwards.

07:29.243 --> 07:31.718
That  guy's the criminal, and
you're telling me to back off?

07:31.770 --> 07:33.167
They're fighting fires.

07:33.211 --> 07:35.820
These inmates have no business
fighting fires, okay?

07:35.820 --> 07:38.570
- They don't belong here.
- His red card says different.

07:38.570 --> 07:40.674
All right, that's enough horsing around.

07:41.028 --> 07:42.447
Here's the FMP.

07:42.505 --> 07:45.341
For all you rookies,
that's Fire Management Plan.

07:46.547 --> 07:50.719
I'm sending you Type 1 hotshots
to Zone 2 for fire suppression.

07:51.525 --> 07:53.717
All right, let's load up, guys.
We're going direct. Come on!

07:53.726 --> 07:57.046
The orange crew is gonna
cut a fire line in Zone 2.

07:57.208 --> 08:00.030
You're also gonna assist
the hotshots if they need it.

08:04.882 --> 08:06.861
He's a great firefighter.

08:06.896 --> 08:08.967
- He's just got a big mouth.
- I understand.

08:09.023 --> 08:11.474
Your crime scene team
is in Zone 5.

08:11.628 --> 08:14.156
We've got a small crew there
just looking for flare-ups.

08:14.156 --> 08:16.204
We'll be as quick
as possible, Chief.

08:23.897 --> 08:25.105
Are you okay?

08:27.019 --> 08:29.697
Crispy around the edges,
but I'll survive.

08:29.708 --> 08:30.524
All right.

08:31.258 --> 08:33.589
Well, then give me
everything pre-gator.

08:33.623 --> 08:36.192
Cause of death:
massive hemothorax.

08:36.519 --> 08:39.885
Collapsed lung, two broken ribs.
Typical shotgun wounds.

08:40.005 --> 08:42.684
Pattern's dispersed,
ten-inch diameter.

08:42.716 --> 08:44.530
There's no tattooing
on the skin.

08:44.574 --> 08:46.856
The barrel was ten yards
away at the most.

08:50.349 --> 08:52.488
You know, Calleigh,
nine times out of ten,

08:52.488 --> 08:55.032
I'm pulling steel
out of a shotgun wound.

08:55.258 --> 08:57.130
Take a look at this.

08:59.163 --> 09:01.851
Looks like lead.
Isn't that against the law?

09:01.926 --> 09:04.910
Yep. It contaminates
the Glades when it breaks down.

09:05.541 --> 09:08.636
These are large, too.
Looks like a double-aught.

09:08.708 --> 09:11.470
Ammunition for
the do-it-yourselfer. Homemade.

09:11.532 --> 09:14.304
Can be unique as a fingerprint.
It could help us ID the shooter.

09:14.305 --> 09:17.495
Well, I may be able
to help you ID the vic.

09:17.898 --> 09:20.048
Found this in one
of his pockets.

09:20.918 --> 09:22.188
College of Miami.

09:23.868 --> 09:26.728
Magnetic strip.
That should get us started.

09:27.070 --> 09:27.740
All right.

09:27.878 --> 09:30.018
I'm gonna go get Ryan.
We're going back to school.

09:45.690 --> 09:49.010
I followed the blood trail.
Phenolpthalein is positive for blood.

09:49.028 --> 09:51.734
The gator dragged the body
to this spot right here.

09:51.788 --> 09:53.827
Coming from that direction.

09:54.221 --> 09:56.623
Well, the victim died
by gunshot wound,

09:56.623 --> 09:59.198
and the shooter assumed that the gator

09:59.525 --> 10:01.017
would clean up the mess.

10:10.921 --> 10:11.830
Eric...

10:12.841 --> 10:16.184
didn't the chief put
the fire line in Zone 2?

10:16.322 --> 10:17.948
Yes, with the inmate crew.

10:18.104 --> 10:21.087
Okay. The fire broke
through right over there.

10:33.659 --> 10:36.915
- Fire found a gap in the fire line.
- Shouldn't be any gaps.

10:36.929 --> 10:39.037
I guess the fire line
didn't hold, huh?

10:39.100 --> 10:41.243
I guess 40 feet of
the line wasn't cut.

10:41.306 --> 10:42.241
Any idea why?

10:42.245 --> 10:45.738
That's somebody else's problem.
I tackle the flames.

10:54.465 --> 10:55.435
Eric.

11:01.950 --> 11:03.289
I'll get my kit.

11:03.525 --> 11:04.475
Do that.

11:07.955 --> 11:09.976
Rolled to an explosion and got a murder.

11:10.626 --> 11:11.910
Shovel in the gut.

11:12.170 --> 11:14.277
Blue uniform.
This guy was a inmate.

11:15.595 --> 11:18.085
Thought these county jail crews
were nonviolent offenders.

11:18.134 --> 11:20.238
Something must have slipped
through the cracks.

11:20.239 --> 11:22.373
This is the work of a seasoned killer.

11:25.042 --> 11:27.102
Some kind of fold-up shovel.

11:28.219 --> 11:31.655
Yes, that's standard issue
for every firefighter nowadays.

11:37.532 --> 11:39.426
Found a red card.

11:42.169 --> 11:43.035
"Craig Adams."

11:43.344 --> 11:44.700
Isn't that the hotshot?

11:45.722 --> 11:46.868
So, Craig,

11:46.999 --> 11:50.080
we found your red card
next to the body of our victim.

11:50.140 --> 11:50.951
Victim?

11:51.011 --> 11:52.385
Don't you mean "criminal"?

11:52.422 --> 11:53.681
Any idea how it got there?

11:53.737 --> 11:55.695
I've been all over this zone
fighting the fire.

11:55.695 --> 11:56.628
Must've dropped it.

11:56.646 --> 11:58.183
We just found your card

11:58.183 --> 12:01.175
next to the body of a man
you had a fight with earlier.

12:01.276 --> 12:02.765
Well, maybe he took it.

12:02.827 --> 12:04.807
Or one of his buddies.

12:05.046 --> 12:06.997
God, I hate working with inmates.

12:07.148 --> 12:08.279
Enough to kill one?

12:08.406 --> 12:10.520
These inmate crews are a joke.

12:10.820 --> 12:12.948
They take a written test.
They drag some

12:12.948 --> 12:15.427
fire hoses around,
and they're deemed firefighters.

12:15.473 --> 12:17.660
So you don't see them as qualified.

12:18.207 --> 12:20.214
We're out here risking our lives.

12:20.274 --> 12:21.868
We don't need to baby-sit.

12:22.279 --> 12:25.194
What we need is a well-trained
Type 1 crew for backup.

12:25.243 --> 12:26.933
The chief said there
wasn't one available.

12:26.988 --> 12:28.229
That's crap.

12:28.801 --> 12:31.196
These  crews are cheap.
They're a buck-an-hour a guy.

12:31.197 --> 12:32.538
They're just trying
to save some money.

12:32.619 --> 12:34.501
Maybe you were just trying
to send a message.

12:34.530 --> 12:36.357
I was working, okay?

12:36.894 --> 12:38.776
Besides, I didn't even see this guy.

12:38.801 --> 12:41.791
The body was less than 50 feet away.
How could you not see anything?

12:41.818 --> 12:43.725
The zone had a flare-up:

12:43.782 --> 12:47.671
blazing, smoky, no visibility.
That's why we called for assistance.

12:48.145 --> 12:49.692
Get the hoses over here.

12:50.956 --> 12:52.446
We got a fire breaking out.

12:54.704 --> 12:55.909
Let me see your gear.

13:04.471 --> 13:05.892
I didn't do it.

13:08.229 --> 13:08.942
Okay.

13:09.005 --> 13:11.584
I may need to ask you
some questions later.

13:19.517 --> 13:20.526
You believe him?

13:20.560 --> 13:21.462
For now.

13:23.576 --> 13:24.246
Yup?

13:26.283 --> 13:27.157
Okay.

13:28.482 --> 13:29.970
Is that the bracelet count?

13:30.035 --> 13:33.997
Yeah, they're missing one inmate
firefighter: Cyrus Everton.

13:34.187 --> 13:36.165
Only the IRC claims he's still at County.

13:36.266 --> 13:39.225
So he can't be in two places
at once, can he, Frank?

13:39.443 --> 13:40.725
Well, we better get over there.

13:52.126 --> 13:53.423
Where's your wristband?

13:54.269 --> 13:55.199
I lost it.

13:56.101 --> 13:58.798
Do I have "stupid" written
all over my bald head?

13:58.798 --> 13:59.874
Let me see your wrist.

14:02.906 --> 14:03.949
Bacon fat.

14:04.288 --> 14:06.712
So you slid your wristband off.
Who'd you give it to?

14:07.191 --> 14:08.745
I'm not goinin
to say another word.

14:08.773 --> 14:13.314
Cyrus, I see you're in here because you
introduced a weapon into the courtroom

14:13.314 --> 14:16.675
and threatened a defendant during his trial.

14:16.728 --> 14:18.211
Defendant's a big movie star.

14:18.260 --> 14:19.259
What's your beef with him?

14:19.444 --> 14:23.596
That movie star raped
my nine-year-old son.

14:24.585 --> 14:27.595
They lock me up in here and
they let Ty Radcliffe go free.

14:27.623 --> 14:31.278
So you swapped bracelets with
someone who would do the deed,

14:31.823 --> 14:32.739
right?

14:33.101 --> 14:35.150
Take out a child molester?

14:36.330 --> 14:38.357
Ten people in here
would be happy to do that.

14:38.415 --> 14:40.099
So who'd you choose?

14:40.375 --> 14:42.025
Tell you when it's done.

14:45.529 --> 14:48.074
Does the name Todd Kendrick ring a bell?

14:51.801 --> 14:53.409
How'd you get fire duty?

14:53.468 --> 14:55.630
I'm in for contempt of court.

14:56.799 --> 14:58.353
I'm listening.

14:59.003 --> 15:00.096
Todd Kendrick?

15:00.150 --> 15:01.473
The Spree Killer?

15:01.538 --> 15:03.314
Aren't they in the
penalty phase of his trial?

15:03.314 --> 15:05.149
That's absolutely correct, Frank.

15:05.371 --> 15:08.679
Cyrus here swapped
bracelets with Mr. Kendrick

15:08.679 --> 15:11.378
and probably created a diversion.

15:32.655 --> 15:35.432
He also provided him
with his fire equipment

15:35.550 --> 15:39.334
so Mr. Kendrick could get
on the jail bus unnoticed.

15:42.620 --> 15:45.627
Prisoners on fire detail
prepare to deploy

15:52.121 --> 15:53.118
Cyrus,

15:53.864 --> 15:55.105
you...

15:55.764 --> 15:57.805
put a monster on the street.

15:59.059 --> 16:00.792
To kill a monster.

16:02.338 --> 16:04.260
Now he's on the loose.

16:13.753 --> 16:15.985
Mr. Radcliffe, we're
trying to help you here.

16:16.691 --> 16:17.553
This is harassment.

16:17.588 --> 16:19.678
My client never sexually
assaulted that boy.

16:19.949 --> 16:21.541
He was acquitted of all charges.

16:22.211 --> 16:25.114
We believe that your client
may be in some danger.

16:25.425 --> 16:26.573
From the kid's father?

16:26.608 --> 16:28.116
That psychopath with the gun?

16:28.151 --> 16:29.180
The judge locked him up.

16:29.215 --> 16:31.772
He made a deal with Todd
Kendrick to come after you.

16:33.452 --> 16:34.875
I know what Kendrick looks like.

16:34.910 --> 16:35.634
I watch the news.

16:37.331 --> 16:39.097
Well, then you know
he's a stone-cold killer.

16:41.507 --> 16:44.042
We're attempting to offer
you police protection.

16:44.147 --> 16:44.867
No way.

16:44.902 --> 16:46.748
Look, I want to put that
whole ugly incident behind me

16:46.749 --> 16:48.694
while I still have a few fans left, hmm?

16:49.409 --> 16:53.261
If I see a police presence
anywhere around his property,

16:53.795 --> 16:56.163
I will sue your entire
department for harassment.

17:01.107 --> 17:02.664
You should put a car on him anyway.

17:02.699 --> 17:07.223
Eric, forcing police protection
on someone is harassment, isn't it?

17:15.248 --> 17:17.082
When was the last time
you were in the Everglades?

17:17.656 --> 17:19.674
I've never been in the
Everglades in my life.

17:19.709 --> 17:20.848
It's gross.

17:20.884 --> 17:22.743
Then why did we find
your keys out there?

17:23.358 --> 17:26.061
I lent my car to my
boyfriend, Jeff McGill.

17:26.367 --> 17:27.714
Have you asked him?

17:28.625 --> 17:30.047
Can you identify this person?

17:32.003 --> 17:33.201
Oh, my God.

17:35.051 --> 17:36.117
Is it Jeff?

17:41.503 --> 17:43.129
That's, um, Paul.

17:44.313 --> 17:45.467
Paul Travers.

17:45.502 --> 17:49.010
He was, um, one of Jeff's
fraternity brothers.

17:49.245 --> 17:50.808
O Zeta Phi.

17:51.556 --> 17:53.351
And what happened to him?

17:53.850 --> 17:55.713
That's what we're trying to figure out.

17:55.988 --> 17:57.549
Do you know if he was with Jeff?

17:57.584 --> 17:59.493
Yeah, they said something about, um,

18:00.157 --> 18:01.996
going to get booze Friday night.

18:02.031 --> 18:05.268
Um... 190 proof or something.

18:05.303 --> 18:07.195
95% pure grain alcohol.

18:07.890 --> 18:09.201
It's  illegal in Florida.

18:09.236 --> 18:11.114
He said he knew someone that made it.

18:11.746 --> 18:12.993
Has Jeff tried to call you?

18:12.994 --> 18:14.505
I've been in class all day.

18:14.540 --> 18:15.714
My phone's been off.

18:15.749 --> 18:17.055
Would you mind turning it on, please.

18:25.045 --> 18:26.422
There's a message from Jeff.

18:31.296 --> 18:32.712
<i>Pam, these freaks are chasing us!</i>

18:33.620 --> 18:34.872
<i>Pam, they're shooting!</i>

18:36.587 --> 18:37.595
There's gunfire.

18:38.347 --> 18:39.540
They're being hunted.

18:40.817 --> 18:42.112
Jeff is still out there.

18:42.147 --> 18:44.206
Will you get in touch
with the service provider

18:44.241 --> 18:45.965
and see if we can get the
coordinates of the phone?

19:22.651 --> 19:24.764
According to the cell
tower triangulation

19:24.799 --> 19:26.459
Jeff's phone is around here somewhere.

19:26.494 --> 19:28.127
Coordinates say we're close.

19:28.162 --> 19:30.294
We're only about a hundred
yards from the still.

19:32.799 --> 19:34.360
I don't see anything.

19:35.068 --> 19:35.971
Wait.

19:57.469 --> 19:58.494
Locals.

20:00.001 --> 20:01.633
Let's go introduce ourselves.

20:09.056 --> 20:10.096
Hi.

20:10.131 --> 20:12.329
Calleigh Duquesne, Ryan Wolfe. CSI.

20:12.364 --> 20:13.359
Dale Buford.

20:13.730 --> 20:15.163
Something I can help you with?

20:15.198 --> 20:17.068
Yeah. Is this your property?

20:17.787 --> 20:19.056
For three generations.

20:19.091 --> 20:20.855
If you're telling me to evacuate,

20:20.890 --> 20:21.839
I'll wait it out.

20:24.262 --> 20:25.999
What do you have in the garage?

20:28.458 --> 20:31.418
We found a dead college student
just outside your property today.

20:32.820 --> 20:34.397
He was killed by a shotgun,

20:35.361 --> 20:37.515
just like this one.

20:45.740 --> 20:47.013
A shot shell reloader.

20:47.248 --> 20:49.241
I hunt. Make my own shot.

20:49.276 --> 20:50.001
So, what?

20:50.015 --> 20:52.152
We found homemade buckshot
in the victim's chest.

20:52.187 --> 20:53.439
These are the tools that make it:

20:53.623 --> 20:55.462
bullet molds, beverage packaging.

20:56.034 --> 20:58.106
Well, that doesn't mean
my shot killed someone.

20:58.141 --> 20:59.886
He was out here buying
pure grain alcohol,

20:59.921 --> 21:01.815
and you have a still on your property.

21:01.850 --> 21:06.210
In fact, accelerant from your still
ignited the fire where the body was found.

21:21.280 --> 21:23.249
I don't know nothing
about no accelerant,

21:23.284 --> 21:26.369
but I haven't fired a single
round today, and that's the truth.

21:26.404 --> 21:27.887
All this is going to
have to come with us.

21:27.922 --> 21:28.850
You can't do that.

21:28.885 --> 21:29.981
Oh, yeah, we can.

21:30.016 --> 21:32.340
A coed told us there
were two guys out here.

21:32.375 --> 21:33.415
Where is the other one?

21:33.450 --> 21:35.182
Look, I don't know what
you're talking about.

21:35.666 --> 21:36.550
Ask my brother.

21:36.585 --> 21:38.750
He's the one scooped the
last of my shot this morning.

21:38.885 --> 21:39.641
Where is he?

21:39.965 --> 21:41.622
Hey, Everglades is a big place.

21:41.835 --> 21:42.861
He could be anywhere.

21:44.116 --> 21:46.365
On the phone, it sounded
like the kid was running.

21:46.966 --> 21:48.600
It's hard to outrun a bullet.

21:48.635 --> 21:50.004
I'm going to check the area hospitals.

21:50.039 --> 21:52.408
I'll call Homicide, see if
they've found anything out here.

21:55.312 --> 21:56.234
Suzie?

21:56.369 --> 21:57.308
Horatio.

21:57.343 --> 21:58.123
- Hey.
- Hi.

21:58.158 --> 21:58.905
Hey, what's going on?

21:58.940 --> 22:00.185
I'm sorry to bother you at work.

22:00.220 --> 22:01.292
No, it's no problem.

22:01.327 --> 22:02.923
I need your help with some paperwork.

22:04.464 --> 22:05.816
Paperwork?

22:07.218 --> 22:08.867
Suzie, these are claim forms.

22:08.902 --> 22:10.298
Is this about Ray's pension?

22:12.341 --> 22:13.807
Don't look at me like that.

22:13.842 --> 22:15.060
I thought we agreed

22:15.520 --> 22:18.257
that I was going to handle
the financial responsibilities.

22:18.292 --> 22:19.041
I'm sorry.

22:19.534 --> 22:20.719
Okay, it's an emergency.

22:20.754 --> 22:21.983
I really need the money.

22:22.018 --> 22:22.998
What's the problem?

22:25.094 --> 22:26.286
It's Madison.

22:27.890 --> 22:29.009
What about Madison?

22:29.697 --> 22:32.064
Doctors said it's something called AML.

22:36.241 --> 22:39.993
Suzie, AML is acute
myelogenous leukemia.

22:40.028 --> 22:40.997
Yeah, I know.

22:41.032 --> 22:42.278
It's a blood cancer.

22:43.389 --> 22:46.135
Doctors explained everything, and, um,

22:46.170 --> 22:47.485
it's not good.

22:49.105 --> 22:50.169
Where is she?

22:51.176 --> 22:52.641
She's at the hospital.

22:53.758 --> 22:55.399
It's a thousand dollars a day.

22:55.434 --> 22:56.595
I can't pay for that.

22:56.630 --> 22:58.873
I don't want you to worry
about that right now, okay?

22:58.908 --> 23:01.175
Horatio, I can't keep going to you.

23:01.210 --> 23:02.842
Suzie, we're family.

23:02.877 --> 23:04.378
I don't want you to worry about it.

23:05.750 --> 23:08.496
How long are you going to
keep paying for Ray's mistakes?

23:13.745 --> 23:15.152
Here's what I want you to do.

23:15.187 --> 23:17.460
Head back to the hospital
and be with Madison.

23:17.495 --> 23:18.916
She needs you right now, all right?

23:20.028 --> 23:21.497
Thanks for bailing us out again.

23:21.532 --> 23:22.384
No, no, don't worry.

23:22.419 --> 23:23.344
You're okay.

23:23.379 --> 23:24.270
Okay, all right.

23:24.305 --> 23:25.296
Here we go.

23:25.331 --> 23:26.135
All right?

23:30.953 --> 23:32.041
- Hey.
- Hi.

23:32.076 --> 23:34.009
You remember, uh, Suzie.

23:34.736 --> 23:35.833
- Hi.
- Hi.

23:35.868 --> 23:36.793
How are you?

23:36.828 --> 23:39.028
So I'm going to take care of
these, and I'll talk to you later.

23:39.063 --> 23:40.537
- Okay. Okay, thanks.
- All right.

23:41.720 --> 23:43.271
Is everything okay?

23:43.306 --> 23:46.445
Yeah, just, uh... just some paperwork.

23:47.249 --> 23:48.642
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

23:49.401 --> 23:50.401
Can you hold that?

24:11.548 --> 24:12.597
Thank you.

24:13.164 --> 24:15.885
Jeff, how you feeling?

24:17.043 --> 24:19.698
Like I got shot 20 times.

24:20.197 --> 24:22.399
Yeah, buckshot'll do that to you.

24:23.063 --> 24:25.412
I'm Calleigh Duquesne.
The hospital called me.

24:26.037 --> 24:27.422
Paul okay?

24:28.041 --> 24:29.755
I'm afraid he's not. He's dead.

24:31.481 --> 24:32.772
Oh, God.

24:34.015 --> 24:36.434
We know that you were
out trying to buy alcohol,

24:36.469 --> 24:37.658
190 proof.

24:39.927 --> 24:41.456
I heard about this guy in the Glades

24:41.491 --> 24:43.099
who was selling it cheap, you know?

24:43.691 --> 24:45.736
He thought I was haggling
with him about the price,

24:45.771 --> 24:48.302
and he grabbed his shotgun,
and we just started running.

24:48.337 --> 24:51.222
The last I looked, Paul
was jumping over a creek.

24:52.090 --> 24:53.467
Is this your pursuer?

24:56.848 --> 24:57.999
No, that's not him.

24:58.718 --> 25:00.343
But he looked like that.

25:00.378 --> 25:01.616
Rural, you mean.

25:03.983 --> 25:05.936
Well, hang in.

25:05.971 --> 25:07.384
We'll be in touch.

25:08.768 --> 25:09.786
'Kay.

25:18.066 --> 25:20.624
I'm thinking my big brother
pointed you in my direction,

25:20.659 --> 25:21.561
right?

25:21.596 --> 25:23.110
He always was a tattletale.

25:23.145 --> 25:25.892
Actually, it was the smell of
ethanol wafting from your direction.

25:25.927 --> 25:27.571
Is there anything you want to admit to?

25:29.215 --> 25:31.395
Like I said, I didn't
shoot no college boy.

25:31.430 --> 25:33.426
I didn't even see no college boy.

25:33.461 --> 25:34.906
Both hands, please.

25:46.780 --> 25:47.774
What's that do?

25:48.597 --> 25:50.173
Reveals gunshot residue.

25:51.696 --> 25:53.539
You want to empty your pockets for us?

26:05.984 --> 26:07.749
You pledge O Zeta Phi, Norm?

26:09.474 --> 26:10.572
You kill Paul Travers?

26:10.607 --> 26:11.666
I did not.

26:14.119 --> 26:15.675
Then what are you doing with his wallet?

26:20.442 --> 26:23.667
I was after marsh rabbit when
I nearly tripped on the fellow.

26:24.195 --> 26:25.757
He was dead already.

26:50.438 --> 26:51.813
First, you didn't see him.

26:52.509 --> 26:54.020
Now he's already dead.

26:54.055 --> 26:55.939
Can't help facts is facts.

26:55.974 --> 26:57.252
And evidence is evidence.

26:57.287 --> 26:58.536
We'll be back.

27:39.776 --> 27:41.517
No GSR on Norm's hands?

27:41.552 --> 27:43.436
GSR wears off pretty fast.

27:43.471 --> 27:44.923
Doesn't exonerate him.

27:46.424 --> 27:48.785
I thought the Buford boys
didn't give us any buckshot.

27:48.820 --> 27:52.234
They didn't; I made my own
using their tools and supplies.

27:53.000 --> 27:55.619
The shot from Paul Travers'
chest is on the left.

27:55.654 --> 27:57.002
My reference is on the right.

28:01.092 --> 28:03.053
I see matching striations.

28:03.386 --> 28:04.411
On buckshot?

28:04.746 --> 28:08.292
Cutting off the sprue from the bullet
mold leaves a very unique tool mark.

28:13.954 --> 28:15.821
"Unique" being the operative word.

28:16.519 --> 28:18.902
The Bufords' ammunition
killed Paul Travers.

28:32.400 --> 28:33.849
What if I said my brother did it?

28:33.884 --> 28:34.705
Did he?

28:37.015 --> 28:38.547
You wonder; maybe a jury will.

28:38.923 --> 28:41.274
Sir, a jury is going to hear evidence

28:41.309 --> 28:43.719
that your family
buckshot killed this man.

28:44.045 --> 28:46.466
You put that shotgun in either
of our hands, you let me know.

28:47.377 --> 28:49.774
In the meantime, you got nothing.

29:00.322 --> 29:01.759
Lab was looking for you.

29:01.794 --> 29:02.839
Were they specific?

29:03.146 --> 29:04.932
Yeah. You paged some
Realtor in the Keys?

29:04.967 --> 29:07.131
She called back, said she
could get you listed right away.

29:07.166 --> 29:08.354
Hey, I appreciate that.

29:09.330 --> 29:10.076
You going somewhere?

29:10.111 --> 29:11.162
Yeah, I'm going to, uh...

29:11.197 --> 29:13.218
I'm going to sell some land down there.

29:13.491 --> 29:14.413
Sure?

29:14.448 --> 29:16.029
Florida land's a good investment.

29:16.064 --> 29:17.891
Yeah. You get a file on Kendrick?

29:18.562 --> 29:21.104
Uh, yeah. Files.

29:21.139 --> 29:22.560
This guy's a killing machine.

29:22.595 --> 29:26.063
Okay. County was his last chance to
escape before sentencing, wasn't it?

29:26.098 --> 29:28.541
Yeah. So, I hear our movie
star refused protection.

29:28.576 --> 29:30.928
Yes, but I don't think
Kendrick'll go there first.

29:30.963 --> 29:33.768
He'll start with his priority,
Frank, which will be personal.

29:34.442 --> 29:37.092
I'll call Eric, see how he's
doing with the murder weapon.

29:40.078 --> 29:41.855
You say the guy was
stuck to a tree with this?

29:42.714 --> 29:43.569
Brutal.

29:52.075 --> 29:53.077
Anything on it?

29:53.312 --> 29:54.451
I found some peat.

29:54.486 --> 29:55.409
Glades are full of it.

29:55.444 --> 29:56.193
Blood, of course.

29:56.428 --> 29:57.413
Also this.

30:02.455 --> 30:03.525
Looks like sand.

30:03.913 --> 30:07.177
Particles of herring, soybean
meal and wheat byproduct.

30:07.577 --> 30:10.440
- Fish food.
- You mean manmade fish food.

30:10.522 --> 30:12.903
Mother Nature doesn't come up
with this mixture on her own.

30:12.935 --> 30:15.205
Yeah, especially not in the Glades.

30:15.430 --> 30:16.718
Narrows it down.

30:16.767 --> 30:17.974
Thanks, Aaron.

30:21.798 --> 30:23.929
Whole area's full of fish farms.

30:25.115 --> 30:27.221
This one got wiped out by Andrew.

30:27.446 --> 30:29.205
Walking distance to the fire line.

30:29.346 --> 30:33.072
Yeah, well, let's see if we can find out
what Kendrick was digging for.

30:37.765 --> 30:39.002
The gun case.

30:39.961 --> 30:41.553
Great. Now he's armed.

30:46.484 --> 30:47.691
Hey, dawg.

30:47.768 --> 30:51.055
They catch you out there,
you gonna lose your spot on the crew.

30:51.380 --> 30:53.174
It's cool, man. I'm just taking a leak.

30:53.274 --> 30:55.222
That's why the guy got the shovel.

31:12.189 --> 31:13.913
Space in there for a .45.

31:16.102 --> 31:17.600
Looks like he had some help.

31:19.146 --> 31:21.681
These are different
patterns that our fugitive.

31:29.051 --> 31:30.402
Turkey vultures.

31:32.607 --> 31:35.439
Where I come from,
vultures can only mean one thing.

31:57.979 --> 32:02.203
Claire Bushnell. She's a videographer.
Sells her footage to Channel 5.

32:02.498 --> 32:05.554
Well, she was looking for
a story out here, she found one.

32:07.219 --> 32:08.255
What ?

32:09.818 --> 32:12.645
She didn't have a clearance.
I chased her away.

32:12.828 --> 32:15.955
It's your fault she was bottom
feeding in an illegal zone ?

32:16.316 --> 32:18.045
Cut yourself some slack, Delko.

32:25.344 --> 32:28.264
That's the same tennis shoe
pattern we saw over there.

32:28.667 --> 32:29.976
Wrong place, wrong time.

32:30.475 --> 32:31.815
She must've seen Kendrick.

32:49.214 --> 32:51.072
He must've walked her to her car...

32:51.644 --> 32:52.947
took her clothes.

32:54.497 --> 32:57.305
Laid her out and shot her
and dragged her out of sight.

33:12.277 --> 33:15.188
All right, I'll call the television station,
find out what kind of car she drives.

33:15.208 --> 33:16.581
Yeah, broadcast it.

33:16.770 --> 33:19.998
So our killer is on the
loose with a gun and a car.

33:20.608 --> 33:21.982
And a head start.

33:25.715 --> 33:28.533
Somebody on the outside buried the gun.

33:29.109 --> 33:30.600
So, who...

33:31.251 --> 33:33.776
visited Kendrick in the last two days ?

33:35.061 --> 33:36.376
Got it right here.

33:39.781 --> 33:41.061
Patty Johanson.

33:41.578 --> 33:42.928
Let's go visit Patty.

33:44.724 --> 33:46.104
So, you're Kendrick's girlfriend.

33:46.168 --> 33:47.471
Ex-girlfriend.

33:48.023 --> 33:50.106
I've been trying to get
rid of Todd for two years.

33:50.140 --> 33:53.126
I've moved five times.
He always finds me.

33:53.530 --> 33:55.068
He's really smart.

33:55.467 --> 33:58.676
If you wanted to get away from him so
badly, why'd you visit him in jail ?

33:58.719 --> 34:00.374
He asked me to come see him.

34:00.539 --> 34:03.157
If I did, he'd leave me alone forever.

34:03.568 --> 34:04.730
What did he want ?

34:04.766 --> 34:06.374
He told me to go to his mom's house...

34:06.592 --> 34:07.895
in her garage.

34:08.353 --> 34:12.350
Get a box, bury it at the abandoned
fish farm by the lightpost.

34:12.478 --> 34:13.759
What was in the box ?

34:13.958 --> 34:16.295
Had a gun... some bullets,

34:16.413 --> 34:17.693
money, his machete.

34:17.786 --> 34:20.646
And you want us to believe
you didn't know it was for him ?

34:21.978 --> 34:23.585
He's looking at Death Row.

34:23.974 --> 34:26.404
How could it be for him ?
I thought it was for Larry.

34:26.533 --> 34:27.789
Who's Larry ?

34:28.458 --> 34:29.774
Larry Van Owen.

34:29.915 --> 34:31.406
He had the cell next to him...

34:31.746 --> 34:33.097
till he got released.

34:33.273 --> 34:34.588
When was that ?

34:35.022 --> 34:36.313
Month ago.

34:37.123 --> 34:38.438
Larry Van Owen.

34:41.303 --> 34:43.428
That's quite a rap sheet,
isn't it, Frank ?

34:43.722 --> 34:44.871
Yeah. No murders.

34:44.931 --> 34:48.536
He robbed a convenience store
in The Roads. Out on bail.

34:48.688 --> 34:51.926
Police report said they never recovered
the money, so you know Larry's got it.

34:51.998 --> 34:54.359
Right, and you know Kendrick
knows about it, too.

34:54.465 --> 34:56.474
Cause you know Larry must
have bragged about it.

34:56.543 --> 34:58.022
He has an address.

34:58.093 --> 35:00.042
Cutler Bay Marina, Slip 5.

35:08.848 --> 35:10.139
Check that out, Frank.

35:13.978 --> 35:15.270
He-Help... me.

35:17.137 --> 35:18.123
Frank...

35:18.310 --> 35:19.614
Get me Rescue, okay ?

35:20.377 --> 35:23.195
We got a man down here.
Send an ambulance.

35:23.429 --> 35:25.972
Okay, partner. Now, I've got
an ambulance coming for you,

35:25.973 --> 35:28.185
- so I want you to hang in there.
- Take it out.

35:30.227 --> 35:31.154
Get it out.

35:31.213 --> 35:33.996
I understand. Listen to me.
Your lung is punctured.

35:35.792 --> 35:39.104
And if I pull that knife out, you'll
bleed to death. Do you understand ?

35:41.440 --> 35:42.989
I want you to understand me now.

35:43.166 --> 35:46.976
That blade is controlling the bleeding. If I
pull it out, you're going to bleed to death.

35:47.035 --> 35:48.385
Don't touch it.

36:04.104 --> 36:05.486
Hold on. I know, I know.

36:05.803 --> 36:07.059
I'm right here.

36:24.317 --> 36:25.609
What do you got ?

36:26.384 --> 36:28.051
Found this box in front of the boat.

36:28.180 --> 36:29.472
It's empty.

36:30.632 --> 36:32.142
So Kendrick has his money.

36:32.210 --> 36:33.955
Yeah, and his man.

36:34.976 --> 36:36.326
Any thoughts on his next mark ?

36:36.880 --> 36:38.853
The movie star's house, Frank.

37:05.212 --> 37:06.516
Got a man down.

37:07.514 --> 37:08.747
Clear.

37:24.432 --> 37:26.169
Doubt he did this to himself.

37:26.416 --> 37:27.978
Fired recently, Frank.

37:28.435 --> 37:30.854
Maybe Kendrick got hit.
I'll put out a broadcast.

37:30.924 --> 37:33.425
Yes, give me roadblocks, please.

37:34.540 --> 37:35.926
He's armed...

37:37.123 --> 37:38.438
and dangerous.

37:41.727 --> 37:43.676
- I found a blood trail.
- Okay.

37:58.644 --> 38:00.629
He must have come out of the back door.

38:10.374 --> 38:12.358
Blood trail ends here.

38:14.108 --> 38:15.416
An awful lot of blood, isn't it ?

38:15.423 --> 38:16.527
Good for us.

38:16.562 --> 38:18.699
Yes, let's get out the dogs, please.

38:21.199 --> 38:22.491
They're on their way.

38:22.679 --> 38:24.616
Roadblocks are set up at every exit.

38:24.816 --> 38:27.258
Horatio, the office said
somebody was trying to reach you.

38:27.363 --> 38:28.384
Got a name ?

38:28.408 --> 38:29.899
Yeah, a woman named Suzie.

38:30.357 --> 38:32.376
Wondering if you could
stop by the hospital.

38:33.234 --> 38:34.866
I'm reachable on the cell, Frank.

39:07.657 --> 39:09.424
- Hey.
- Hi.

39:13.650 --> 39:15.189
Listen, how's she doing ?

39:15.717 --> 39:16.997
Tired.

39:19.204 --> 39:20.049
Mad.

39:21.283 --> 39:24.042
- She doesn't get why she's here.
- Well, that's...

39:24.488 --> 39:25.956
that's understandable.

39:26.426 --> 39:27.271
I...

39:27.998 --> 39:30.341
I spoke to the case manager
on the way over

39:30.342 --> 39:33.614
and I don't want you to worry
about the bills. All right ?

39:33.728 --> 39:35.184
Thanks, Horatio.

39:35.759 --> 39:37.039
But...

39:38.013 --> 39:39.809
the bills are the least of it now.

39:39.844 --> 39:41.148
Why do you say that ?

39:42.815 --> 39:44.518
I took a blood test.

39:46.044 --> 39:48.486
My bone marrow doesn't match.

39:51.938 --> 39:53.312
All right, so then...

39:53.394 --> 39:54.850
so they need another donor.

39:55.555 --> 39:57.802
Try to tell me I'm not a bad mother now.

39:57.891 --> 40:00.216
Even my blood is no good for her.

40:03.303 --> 40:04.982
You know what ? Let me...

40:05.240 --> 40:06.567
let me try something.

40:06.966 --> 40:08.211
Okay ?

40:08.445 --> 40:09.843
- Horatio...
- I'm family,

40:09.901 --> 40:11.193
and...

40:11.592 --> 40:13.459
You stay with her.
I'll be right back.

40:18.331 --> 40:20.856
- You've given blood before, right ?
- Yeah. I have.

40:21.336 --> 40:23.485
So you're Ms. Barnam's brother ?

40:23.556 --> 40:25.364
I am her brother-in-law.

40:33.583 --> 40:36.390
Sorry I had to pick up
a body at Dade Memorial.

40:39.688 --> 40:42.037
Movie stars'lives, huh ?

40:42.752 --> 40:45.230
Silk pajamas in the middle of the day.

40:45.289 --> 40:46.874
Living the dream.

40:47.872 --> 40:50.842
Never seen one of these
keypads outside a bedroom door.

40:50.889 --> 40:54.188
Motion detector in front of the door.
Another one down the hall.

40:55.891 --> 40:58.274
Probably wanted to see who's
coming toward his bedroom.

40:58.368 --> 41:01.796
Makes sense. Ty Radcliffe, big star.

41:02.113 --> 41:05.777
Except that the rest of the
security system in the house is basic.

41:06.246 --> 41:09.064
This bedroom is more secure
than any other part of the house.

41:09.134 --> 41:14.735
So he was more concerned about people
already in the house coming into his bedroom.

41:14.960 --> 41:16.275
I'm affraid so.

41:17.353 --> 41:18.773
It gets worse.

41:19.384 --> 41:21.451
Found another keypad over here.

41:33.755 --> 41:35.398
It's not just a rumor.

41:36.620 --> 41:38.252
All the trappings.

41:38.803 --> 41:41.022
He is a child molester.

41:41.534 --> 41:42.794
Sickening.

41:47.385 --> 41:50.086
Eric, help me load him onto
a gurney and get out of here.

41:50.180 --> 41:52.493
This place gives me the creeps.

42:05.663 --> 42:08.411
Hey. Alexx Woods. ME's office.

42:10.243 --> 42:11.558
Two for two.

43:32.349 --> 43:34.074
- Yeah ?
- Alexx is in trouble.

43:34.133 --> 43:35.495
Okay, I'm on my way.

43:43.060 --> 43:44.622
They are going to be looking for me.

43:44.727 --> 43:45.972
Pull over.

43:47.135 --> 43:48.403
Do it.

43:56.950 --> 43:58.254
Hand me your badge.

43:58.559 --> 44:00.285
- What ?
- Your badge.

44:09.982 --> 44:13.106
1145 Magnolia. Kendall. Nice.

44:15.078 --> 44:16.076
Listen...

44:16.122 --> 44:17.273
we moved.

44:17.308 --> 44:18.588
Yeah, sure you have.

44:19.727 --> 44:21.747
If you don't do exactly what I say,

44:21.911 --> 44:23.273
I will go to your home,

44:23.379 --> 44:24.905
and I will kill your children.

44:31.879 --> 44:33.229
I'll do whatever you say.

44:33.475 --> 44:34.720
Good.

44:51.275 --> 44:52.660
I should have checked that gurney.

44:52.684 --> 44:53.975
It's not your fault, Eric.

44:54.022 --> 44:56.335
Guy's smart. He gets shot
and trapped by the cops.

44:56.382 --> 44:57.745
Two things he wasn't counting on.

44:57.779 --> 45:01.184
So he fakes an escape in the water,
doubles back and hides.

45:01.328 --> 45:04.354
When he spotted Alexx's van, he knew
she was his way past the roadblock.

45:04.448 --> 45:07.031
More than that.
He knows Alexx is a doctor.

45:07.125 --> 45:08.639
So he's going to make her help him.

45:08.686 --> 45:10.095
And once she does that...

45:13.129 --> 45:14.498
He's going to kill her.

45:25.264 --> 45:27.237
Don't even think of trying to kill me.

45:28.306 --> 45:29.609
I know.

45:29.996 --> 45:31.687
I'm the one who took the oath.

45:36.125 --> 45:37.863
You're going to need to rest.

45:38.754 --> 45:40.739
That gurney's secure.
You can lay on that.

45:41.138 --> 45:44.296
Yeah, thanks, Doc. I think
I'll ride up front with you.

45:44.543 --> 45:45.682
Wait a minute.

45:45.729 --> 45:47.678
We got one more stop to make.

45:49.721 --> 45:51.047
Get in.

45:51.312 --> 45:52.591
Get in.

45:52.662 --> 45:55.303
I need to call in. They're
going to be wondering where I am.

45:55.304 --> 45:56.237
Drive.

45:56.730 --> 45:59.489
With all the fire and commotion,
they don't even know you're gone.

45:59.724 --> 46:01.004
Drive.

46:01.720 --> 46:02.929
Drive.

46:08.952 --> 46:11.406
Do all county vehicles
have mileage tracking now ?

46:11.559 --> 46:12.240
Yep.

46:12.299 --> 46:15.434
They're hidden in each vehicle.
Keeps the employees honest.

46:15.539 --> 46:18.111
Sergeant, you can activate
this remotely, can't you ?

46:18.157 --> 46:20.106
- Right.
- Let's do that.

46:22.079 --> 46:25.519
Currently, there are only four
tracking devices activated on county vehicles.

46:25.695 --> 46:27.151
Yours will make five.

46:27.233 --> 46:29.006
How long does it take to activate ?

46:29.076 --> 46:30.556
Only a few seconds.

46:32.904 --> 46:34.757
All right, how do we know
which one is Alexx ?

46:34.770 --> 46:36.954
I've been watching these
four vehicles for weeks.

46:37.001 --> 46:40.195
Those four are on the job
in their proper locations.

46:40.593 --> 46:41.909
There's your vehicle.

46:42.414 --> 46:43.717
In Miami Shores.

46:43.776 --> 46:46.359
Gentlemen, that van is not moving.

46:53.097 --> 46:54.412
What are we doing here ?

46:55.093 --> 46:56.338
All you got to remember

46:56.361 --> 46:58.769
is 1145 Magnolia, Kendall.

46:58.827 --> 47:01.316
I told you. I'll do whatever you say.

47:01.962 --> 47:03.312
Just making sure.

47:09.320 --> 47:12.057
- Leave the boy alone.
- Joey. Joey Everton.

47:13.045 --> 47:14.370
I know your dad.

47:14.853 --> 47:15.981
Where's your mom?

47:16.002 --> 47:17.773
She-she's taking a nap.

47:17.781 --> 47:18.963
We don't want to wake her.

47:18.976 --> 47:19.783
He's just a kid.

47:19.819 --> 47:21.367
- What do you want from him?
- Shut up!

47:21.630 --> 47:23.194
Show me your dad's office.

47:24.570 --> 47:25.018
Come on.

47:28.313 --> 47:29.196
Show me.

47:29.378 --> 47:30.229
Come on.

47:31.714 --> 47:34.660
All right, open the file drawer.
Open it. Stay there.

47:35.211 --> 47:36.650
Get over there.
Get over there.

47:52.302 --> 47:53.248
Let's go.

47:53.267 --> 47:54.720
Come on.

47:59.138 --> 48:00.964
Okay, you have what you want.

48:01.012 --> 48:02.010
Now let us go.

48:02.010 --> 48:04.968
There's one more thing I have
to do. Come here. Come here.

48:04.971 --> 48:06.125
No, please.

48:06.127 --> 48:07.222
I want to show you something.

48:07.225 --> 48:07.633
Don't.

48:07.634 --> 48:08.986
I think it's going
to make you really happy.

48:08.986 --> 48:10.024
Don't do this.

48:13.084 --> 48:13.640
Look.

48:14.026 --> 48:16.496
It's the movie star.
The guy who hurt you.

48:16.523 --> 48:17.899
You bastard.

48:19.121 --> 48:21.594
You bastard.

48:22.262 --> 48:23.502
All right, come on.

48:23.864 --> 48:24.948
Come on.

48:27.992 --> 48:29.442
Get down on the ground.

48:30.737 --> 48:33.963
- Let the boy go.
- Get down on the ground.

48:37.240 --> 48:38.338
Get down on the...

48:39.543 --> 48:42.205
Run, Joey! Run! Run!

49:06.958 --> 49:09.011
Alexx? Alexx?

49:09.011 --> 49:10.720
There's a little boy inside.

49:10.724 --> 49:11.911
Are you okay?

49:12.436 --> 49:14.866
The killer grabbed some
papers out of the office.

49:14.875 --> 49:16.181
- Okay, Eric.
- I'll be inside.

49:17.445 --> 49:19.987
Alexx, look at me.
Are you sure you're okay?

49:20.457 --> 49:22.539
I'll feel better when I see my kids.

49:22.573 --> 49:25.360
Okay. I sent a car over there,
and they're fine.

49:28.866 --> 49:31.849
Officer. I'm going
to get you a ride home. Okay?

49:32.040 --> 49:34.912
You hang in there. Take her home.

49:47.112 --> 49:48.250
Yes?

49:48.401 --> 49:49.782
Speaking.

49:50.783 --> 49:52.169
Oh, hi, Doctor.

49:53.600 --> 49:54.753
Okay, so,

49:54.791 --> 49:56.953
so let me get this straight.
I'm not a match.

49:56.991 --> 49:59.653
But the best bet's a relative right?

50:00.555 --> 50:01.348
Okay, you know what?

50:01.386 --> 50:04.079
Um, I-I'm going
to have to call you back.

50:10.826 --> 50:11.990
Yeah. Yelina.

50:12.088 --> 50:14.251
Hi. Um, where are you?

50:14.451 --> 50:16.249
I need to speak to you.

50:18.106 --> 50:19.444
You buzzed me?

50:20.492 --> 50:21.608
Pam Carpenter.

50:21.783 --> 50:24.085
She's asking about Paul Travers.

50:24.826 --> 50:25.570
Thanks.

50:27.092 --> 50:28.003
Miss Carpenter.

50:28.591 --> 50:30.162
Is there something
that I can help you with?

50:30.220 --> 50:31.117
Yes, um,

50:31.117 --> 50:33.897
I'm here for Paul Travers'
personal effects.

50:34.813 --> 50:36.857
Oh, I'm afraid
you're in the wrong building.

50:36.857 --> 50:38.756
That's the Medical Examiner's.

50:40.599 --> 50:42.039
But did you know that only family

50:42.041 --> 50:43.756
can collect personal effects?

50:45.042 --> 50:46.516
I kind of am...

50:47.251 --> 50:48.149
family.

50:49.192 --> 50:51.184
I thought Jeff McGill
was your boyfriend.

50:52.363 --> 50:54.524
You can't help
who you fall in love with.

50:55.264 --> 50:56.248
I see.

50:57.788 --> 51:00.075
Does Jeff know
that he wasn't the one?

51:00.417 --> 51:02.123
We'd been meaning to tell him.

51:02.328 --> 51:04.201
- You and Paul.
- Yeah.

51:05.264 --> 51:07.817
We were just trying
to find the right time.

51:08.814 --> 51:10.377
Would you mind staying here

51:10.446 --> 51:12.001
until I contact Jeff?

51:12.632 --> 51:13.940
Is something wrong?

51:13.973 --> 51:15.609
And would you mind not
answering your cell phone

51:15.609 --> 51:17.291
until I contact you ?

51:25.020 --> 51:26.087
Jeff.

51:26.407 --> 51:28.060
Thanks for coming in.

51:28.264 --> 51:29.509
Have a seat.

51:31.300 --> 51:32.898
I'd prefer to stand.

51:34.184 --> 51:36.255
Oh, right. I'm sorry.

51:38.632 --> 51:40.228
Are you aware that you're bleeding?

51:42.435 --> 51:43.343
It doesn't hurt.

51:44.046 --> 51:45.804
You must've pulled a stitch.
We'll transport you

51:45.804 --> 51:47.606
back to the hospital
as soon as we're finished.

51:52.152 --> 51:54.859
I... you said on the phone
you want to talk about Paul?

51:54.906 --> 51:57.560
Would you allow me to take
a few strands of your hair?

51:57.616 --> 51:59.804
Just for exclusionary purposes?

52:00.568 --> 52:01.987
Yeah, sure, I guess.

52:14.982 --> 52:15.987
Thank you.

53:01.225 --> 53:02.938
You get restitched?

53:03.602 --> 53:04.598
Yeah, thanks.

53:04.633 --> 53:05.692
Have a seat.

53:07.359 --> 53:08.845
You shot your friend.

53:09.216 --> 53:12.216
What? No way.
Jethro was shooting at us.

53:12.216 --> 53:13.121
At you,

53:13.881 --> 53:15.319
after you already killed Paul.

53:15.369 --> 53:17.593
- I did not kill him.
- Yes, you did.

53:18.277 --> 53:22.179
With the Bufords' shotgun.
You held it, aimed it and shot it.

53:30.361 --> 53:32.331
That's the only way the wadding
could've ended up in your hair.

53:32.331 --> 53:34.836
It was made of high-strength
beverage packaging,

53:34.920 --> 53:38.021
the same substance our trace lab
found in your hair sample.

53:38.083 --> 53:41.149
I ran a little experiment of
my own to confirm the physics.

53:41.479 --> 53:43.845
We know he was seeing your girlfriend.

53:47.781 --> 53:49.919
Whole campus knew.

53:51.927 --> 53:53.912
I found out over the weekend.

53:55.168 --> 53:57.250
You decided to make a moonshine run.

53:58.496 --> 54:01.023
We must be early.
Wait here. I'll go get 'em.

54:19.679 --> 54:21.536
Whoa, man, what the hell are you doing?

54:21.601 --> 54:23.554
You've been lying to me for months.

54:23.594 --> 54:25.654
Don't be stupid. Put the gun down.

54:29.993 --> 54:32.127
Tried to nail it all on the Bufords.

54:33.415 --> 54:37.263
Then what, you got surprised when
you were sneaking the gun back?

54:45.764 --> 54:47.739
Getting shot almost
bought you an alibi.

54:48.860 --> 54:51.550
You know, I didn't plan on it,
but, yeah, it almost worked.

54:51.760 --> 54:54.982
Big difference between
almost and 25 to life.

55:03.836 --> 55:05.934
You sounded urgent. What's up?

55:06.261 --> 55:08.441
Have a seat. Okay?

55:17.762 --> 55:19.431
That look in your eyes.

55:20.307 --> 55:22.249
I've only seen it once before.

55:22.879 --> 55:25.861
Suzie Barnam, Yelina.

55:27.585 --> 55:29.800
From the elevator. Yes, uh...

55:31.361 --> 55:34.061
I already told you.
You don't have to explain yourself.

55:36.009 --> 55:37.018
I mentioned

55:37.102 --> 55:39.904
that there are complications
with Suzie, didn't I ?

55:40.450 --> 55:41.747
And there are.

55:45.345 --> 55:46.948
Yes.

55:49.353 --> 55:52.249
Madison is not my daughter.

55:53.361 --> 55:55.254
What do you mean, not your daughter?

55:55.873 --> 55:57.797
But she looks just like...

55:58.931 --> 56:00.027
Like...

56:02.416 --> 56:03.838
Ray?

56:03.966 --> 56:05.648
I'm sorry.

56:06.691 --> 56:09.136
I'm so sorry, Yelina.

56:11.928 --> 56:13.157
But...

56:17.314 --> 56:18.928
How long have you known?

56:19.092 --> 56:21.418
I've known all along.

56:33.745 --> 56:35.168
Then why...

56:35.688 --> 56:37.220
why tell me now?

56:37.247 --> 56:38.342
Madison

56:38.944 --> 56:40.083
is sick.

56:40.635 --> 56:42.360
She needs a bone marrow transplant,

56:42.362 --> 56:44.174
and it turns out that I'm not a match.

56:44.192 --> 56:46.750
But she does need
a relative as a donor.

56:47.169 --> 56:49.025
I'm no relative to that girl.

56:49.410 --> 56:50.461
I know that.

56:52.807 --> 56:53.806
Ray, Jr.?

56:56.657 --> 56:58.224
What Ray did

56:59.557 --> 57:00.824
is what Ray did.

57:01.571 --> 57:04.865
My son, his son, shouldn't
have to pay for it.

57:05.285 --> 57:06.470
I won't let him.

57:06.528 --> 57:08.139
Yelina, the child could die.

57:08.209 --> 57:09.250
I can't.

57:10.696 --> 57:12.009
Whether we like it or not,

57:12.114 --> 57:13.515
Madison is family.

57:14.904 --> 57:16.113
Not my family.

57:32.989 --> 57:35.590
Bad news for you.
Your friend Todd Kendrick

57:35.595 --> 57:37.702
paid a visit to your family home,

57:38.300 --> 57:41.631
and held your son at gunpoint.

57:42.772 --> 57:43.472
Oh, my God.

57:43.472 --> 57:45.316
He lifted a file from your office,

57:45.316 --> 57:48.432
and I'm curious, Cyrus,
as to what he's after.

57:48.600 --> 57:49.799
Uh, I don't know.

57:50.012 --> 57:50.909
I swear, I...

57:50.921 --> 57:53.306
Cyrus, it is time for you to tell me

57:53.324 --> 57:55.727
everything Kendrick
talked to you about.

57:55.785 --> 57:57.428
We talked about my son,

57:57.462 --> 57:58.443
uh, Radcliffe.

57:58.468 --> 57:59.042
What else?

57:59.324 --> 58:01.644
Um, I talked to him about my business--

58:01.645 --> 58:03.277
installing security systems.

58:03.652 --> 58:05.558
Yeah, I've installed security systems

58:05.567 --> 58:07.217
for all the big fish in Miami.

58:07.228 --> 58:08.312
A-list clients,

58:08.380 --> 58:10.151
big money people you
never even heard of.

58:10.683 --> 58:12.947
You'd be surprised how many
people forget their passwords.

58:12.991 --> 58:14.930
I get calls at all hours of the night.

58:15.026 --> 58:16.081
So, what did you do?

58:16.135 --> 58:17.990
After the first dozen times,
I learned my lesson.

58:18.017 --> 58:21.003
I keep all the pass codes
in a file in my office.

58:21.667 --> 58:22.958
Saves me a lot of time.

58:23.164 --> 58:24.043
The pass codes.

58:24.714 --> 58:26.400
He must have taken the master list.

58:26.457 --> 58:27.533
How many codes were on there?

58:27.578 --> 58:28.889
Um, close to 50.

58:28.923 --> 58:30.860
Did he mention anyone specifically?

58:30.901 --> 58:34.636
He asked who my richest client was.
I-I told him that he didn't like banks.

58:34.636 --> 58:35.633
He was never at home, and...

58:35.668 --> 58:38.257
What is the name of
your richest client, Cyrus?

58:38.771 --> 58:40.106
Russell Chan.

58:49.771 --> 58:52.295
<i>We're at the Chan house.
It's already been hit.</i>

58:52.295 --> 58:55.129
<i>Airboat's missing from the family
slip, headed for the Everglades.</i>

58:55.349 --> 58:57.254
<i>Got a chopper up tracking him now.</i>

58:57.309 --> 58:58.622
I'm on my way.

59:01.402 --> 59:02.942
Don't let him get away.

59:04.617 --> 59:05.917
We'll get him. Come on!

59:05.948 --> 59:08.105
Come on. Let's go!
Let's go. Come on.

59:08.105 --> 59:09.100
We can catch him!

01:01:22.312 --> 01:01:25.067
Kendrick! Kendrick!

01:01:25.401 --> 01:01:27.015
There's nowhere to go.

01:01:27.365 --> 01:01:29.019
Now, put that weapon down

01:01:29.291 --> 01:01:30.209
right now.

01:01:30.707 --> 01:01:33.533
Go put the weapon down.
Get on the ground now.

01:01:37.093 --> 01:01:38.816
Turn around slowly,

01:01:39.308 --> 01:01:40.490
and get down.

01:01:43.353 --> 01:01:45.434
You're always one step behind.

01:01:46.625 --> 01:01:47.601
Get down.

01:01:52.324 --> 01:01:54.321
Hey! Kend...!

01:01:58.587 --> 01:02:00.559
He'll never make it out of there alive.

01:02:05.701 --> 01:02:07.167
No way.

01:02:23.059 --> 01:02:24.635
Tough to ID.

01:02:26.579 --> 01:02:27.735
Not for me.

01:02:36.424 --> 01:02:38.820
Put that bandage on myself.

01:02:44.090 --> 01:02:45.836
I had to be sure.

01:03:04.298 --> 01:03:05.684
How's she feeling?

01:03:06.382 --> 01:03:07.450
I don't know.

01:03:08.658 --> 01:03:12.203
I mean, she's my daughter,
so she's tough, right?

01:03:12.406 --> 01:03:13.737
You both are.

01:03:16.961 --> 01:03:18.774
Chemo's wearing her out.

01:03:21.954 --> 01:03:23.425
Well...

01:03:24.417 --> 01:03:25.711
that's normal.

01:03:25.827 --> 01:03:28.055
We're out of options, aren't we?

01:03:28.564 --> 01:03:30.601
Suzie, we tried something;
it didn't work.

01:03:30.601 --> 01:03:32.381
It doesn't mean we're out of options.

01:03:34.695 --> 01:03:36.392
So, what now?

01:03:36.594 --> 01:03:38.835
Well, there's the
National Board of Donors.

01:03:38.836 --> 01:03:40.993
There are other countries.
But it's important

01:03:41.055 --> 01:03:43.914
that we keep looking and
that we do not give up hope.

01:04:05.344 --> 01:04:07.268
You ready?
