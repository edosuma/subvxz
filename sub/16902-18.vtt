WEBVTT

00:05.820 --> 00:07.270
Okay.

00:07.300 --> 00:12.380
Now,you're all here because you've been
suspended om work for sexual harassment.

00:12.390 --> 00:13.810
But through this seminar,

00:13.840 --> 00:18.030
You will learn the skills to keep you from making
the same kinds of mistakes that got you here.

00:18.060 --> 00:19.980
Excuse me,mr.
Winerslav--

00:20.000 --> 00:21.790
It's pronounced "weener-slave."

00:21.810 --> 00:23.560
okay,jeffrey.

00:23.580 --> 00:26.840
Is there anything I can do to
speed this process up so I can just

00:26.880 --> 00:28.120
I'm afraid not.

00:28.160 --> 00:31.030
But someone who's in a
rush to get back to work?

00:31.050 --> 00:33.420
That's somethin' you
don't see every day.

00:33.450 --> 00:39.590
Now,that is an example of a very
appropriate and very,very funny joke.

00:46.420 --> 00:47.670
Jenna, I need to speak with you.

00:47.700 --> 00:49.740
Jack,i did not hit that asian page.

00:49.770 --> 00:52.200
I was just swinging my arm
and she walked into me. Twice.

00:52.210 --> 00:54.120
Jenna,it's not about that.

00:54.150 --> 00:56.410
It's about your sheinhardt-universal
janis joplin biopic.

00:56.420 --> 00:58.690
Wait. We can call her janis joplin?

00:58.700 --> 01:01.540
We got the life rights? It's
not janie jimplin anymore?

01:01.550 --> 01:03.600
Apparently, neither name cleared.

01:03.650 --> 01:07.650
It looks like your character's
going to be called jackie jormp-jomp.

01:07.660 --> 01:10.690
- Oh,okay. So what's the good news?
- I didn't say there was any.

01:10.700 --> 01:13.490
Sheinhardt-universal did
some focus testing this week.

01:13.500 --> 01:16.430
- We got 100?
- You're holding that upsiddown.

01:16.440 --> 01:19.140
- Oh,no.
- Yes. I was afraid of this.

01:19.150 --> 01:23.310
It turns out not having the life rights or any
janis joplin songs was a negative for audiences.

01:23.330 --> 01:26.170
But what about my duet with
jimi hendrickson at woodstocks?

01:26.180 --> 01:28.860
We're all here at woodstocks

01:28.870 --> 01:31.880
someday there will be a black president

01:31.890 --> 01:34.910
uh,jenna, Sheinhdtniversal does
not wanna release the picture.

01:34.950 --> 01:36.770
And how will that
affect my oscar chances?

01:36.800 --> 01:39.680
Adversely. Unless we get
independent distribution.

01:39.690 --> 01:44.860
To do that, "sing dem blues,white girl: "the
jackie jormp-jomp story" has gotta get some buzz.

01:44.890 --> 01:46.190
I'm gonna need your help for that.

01:46.210 --> 01:48.840
Do you need a sex tape
released? 'Cause I got a wrdne.

01:48.850 --> 01:51.690
It's night vision and you can
see that his buddy is robbing me.

01:51.710 --> 01:54.370
No,jenna,i want you on the pr warpath.

01:54.400 --> 01:57.600
If there's a red carpet,i want you on
it talking up the movie starting monday.

01:57.610 --> 02:00.020
The kids' choice awards? Fine.

02:00.030 --> 02:03.300
I'll set aside my feud with
raven simone for one day.

02:03.330 --> 02:04.780
But she knows what she did.

02:33.220 --> 02:35.810
Miss lemon,you aren't
supposed to be here.

02:35.830 --> 02:37.930
You're on
s-e-x probation.

02:37.950 --> 02:41.520
Yeah,i know,i just wanted
to stop by and check in.

02:42.630 --> 02:46.530
Kenneth,stop. I just want
a script or a rundown,okay?

02:47.240 --> 02:49.940
Put that down. You
give that to me,kenneth.

02:49.950 --> 02:51.760
Did you hear what I said?

02:52.740 --> 02:55.650
Mr. Donaghy,help! Rule breaking!

02:56.750 --> 02:58.600
This is sad.

02:58.610 --> 03:00.620
Lemon,come with me.

03:01.840 --> 03:04.870
Lemon,you know you're supposed to
go home after your pervert seminars.

03:04.900 --> 03:07.710
I'm going. I just hate not being here.

03:08.180 --> 03:12.200
- You have to rehearse!
- No! Passive resistance!

03:12.210 --> 03:15.580
I learned that from dr. King! I'm brave!

03:15.590 --> 03:17.530
- You sure you miss this?
- Yes.

03:17.540 --> 03:21.560
As crazy and stressful as this
place is, not being here is worse.

03:21.860 --> 03:22.900
I feel for you.

03:22.940 --> 03:25.400
Remember that time I came back from
the world economic forum with mono

03:25.440 --> 03:28.710
And missed a week of work and I wanted to pull
my hair out but I couldn't because it's too thick?

03:28.740 --> 03:30.240
People like us, we need the stress.

03:30.270 --> 03:32.340
We're only happy when
we're overcoming obstacles.

03:32.370 --> 03:36.350
You take that away, we start bouncing off the
walls, spend our days jabbering at doormen.

03:36.380 --> 03:38.780
Hey,i brighten their day.

03:40.780 --> 03:43.660
Before I go,can I at least
find out what frank's hat says?

03:43.690 --> 03:45.940
- "constant cving."
- He could do better.

03:45.950 --> 03:48.720
Has anyone looked at this sexual
harassment stuff they gave us?

03:48.740 --> 03:49.670
I don't need to read it.

03:49.700 --> 03:53.490
The whole thing is loosely based on
a evening I spent with isiah thomas.

03:53.500 --> 03:55.270
No wonder liz got busted.

03:55.280 --> 03:59.370
According to this, you can't do anything
without it being considered harassment.

03:59.390 --> 04:03.370
Did you know you have to
report in-office relationships?

04:03.400 --> 04:05.590
- Is that true?
- It's the first thing listed.

04:05.600 --> 04:06.870
Have you read this?

04:06.880 --> 04:09.460
Well,i wanted to, because
it's full of rules,

04:09.480 --> 04:11.210
but ms.Vieira made me throw it away.

04:11.220 --> 04:14.750
And said pretty boys like me shouldn't
be filling their heads with ideas.

04:15.710 --> 04:17.410
- Hi,frank.
- Hello.

04:17.790 --> 04:20.060
Coworker.

04:22.610 --> 04:24.280
Ms.vieira...

04:24.320 --> 04:27.760
Of course my job is annoying, but
that doesn't mean I don't love it.

04:27.790 --> 04:29.220
I'm sure your job can be annoying.

04:29.260 --> 04:31.620
Not all the tenants are as fun as me.

04:31.640 --> 04:33.370
I get it.

04:33.390 --> 04:36.720
Hey,would you mind if
brought a chair down here?

04:36.730 --> 04:39.190
Yes,my job is stressful. Very stressful.

04:39.200 --> 04:42.650
But in the end,i get
paid to make people laugh.

04:42.900 --> 04:48.480
We have a saying that laughter is the best
medicine, so I'm kind of like a doctor here.

04:48.490 --> 04:50.020
Like you were,in poland.

04:50.060 --> 04:51.510
We have a show tonight.

04:51.550 --> 04:53.370
I've never missed a show.

04:53.390 --> 04:57.550
Not even the time I had that virus
they kept saying only raccoons get.

04:57.560 --> 05:00.080
I can't believe I'm not there.

05:01.800 --> 05:04.500
Hey,I've-- uh,I've picked
up some polish from you guys.

05:04.510 --> 05:07.120
******

05:07.980 --> 05:09.440
It's kinda cold out for a jog.

05:09.470 --> 05:13.080
- Oh,I'm just going downstairs to the fitness center.
- What? This building has a gym?

05:13.090 --> 05:15.810
Yeah,it'the door right next
to the vending machines.

05:15.840 --> 05:17.240
Vending machines? What kind?

05:17.250 --> 05:22.350
I don't know,sorry. I'm emily.
Are you new to the building?

05:22.360 --> 05:25.060
No,I'm liz. I've lived
here for four years.

05:25.070 --> 05:31.040
I usually work crazy,long hours, but I'm
on leave right now for normal reasons.

05:31.050 --> 05:33.600
- And you're feeling a little lost.
- I am.

05:33.610 --> 05:38.090
Right now,i should be standing in a toilet
stall so nobody bothers me while I eat lunch.

05:38.100 --> 05:39.520
God,i miss it.

05:39.540 --> 05:42.310
I was an investment banker for 15 years.

05:42.320 --> 05:46.290
80-hour workweeks, corner
office, secret candy drawer...

05:46.300 --> 05:48.770
A a decoy candy drawer to
throw others off the trail?

05:48.800 --> 05:50.070
Smart.

05:50.100 --> 05:52.880
The point is you get
addicted to the stress.

05:52.910 --> 05:54.820
Think it gives your life purpose.

05:54.840 --> 05:57.540
- And then when you stop--
- for normal reasons...

05:57.550 --> 06:00.370
You see how stupid you were.

06:00.410 --> 06:05.190
It just takes time to realize there
are much better ways to be happy.

06:07.510 --> 06:10.180
Wait for me... Lady.

06:11.620 --> 06:12.770
Kenneth, what can I do for ya?

06:12.800 --> 06:15.940
Well,sir, I recently learned
that company policy requires

06:15.980 --> 06:20.730
That employees disclose their relationships
with their cowkers to their immediate supervisor.

06:20.750 --> 06:26.650
I am not kyo there are
perhaps 40 people between us.

06:26.660 --> 06:27.930
Pete,for instance.

06:27.970 --> 06:30.900
Oh,i just don't trust
mr. Hornberger,sir.

06:30.930 --> 06:34.660
He has a ridge on the section of the
skull associated with deviousness.

06:34.680 --> 06:37.150
Okay. So there's a girl.

06:37.160 --> 06:41.710
Yes,sir. Her name is daphne.
She's one of thetgsdancers.

06:41.720 --> 06:45.240
And when I watch her dance,
my heart skips a beat.

06:45.260 --> 06:47.900
And not because of my acute ventralitis.

06:49.820 --> 06:52.800
Wait. You're dating one of the dancers?

06:52.810 --> 06:53.990
Oh,no,sir.

06:54.030 --> 06:58.050
I actually haven't spoken to her yet,
but I have a long-term plan to marry her,

06:58.070 --> 07:00.580
And I wanted the company to
be aware of my intentions.

07:00.590 --> 07:03.600
I see. I'll be sure to mention
that at the next board meeting.

07:03.610 --> 07:05.430
Thank you,sir.

07:05.790 --> 07:08.360
Oh,also, I don't know
if this is harassment,

07:08.380 --> 07:13.060
But someone atthe today show made me
eat an unripe bana in front of her.

07:17.640 --> 07:20.880
Hey,ken. Do you know who
our immediate supervisor is?

07:24.270 --> 07:26.780
I will not be able to
attend your wedding.

07:26.820 --> 07:28.990
Because of a prior conflict.

07:36.410 --> 07:38.410
Oh,what's the special occasion?

07:38.430 --> 07:40.160
Weekday.

07:40.170 --> 07:42.080
w,so this is normal?

07:42.100 --> 07:44.920
This is,like,your version
of sweatpants and pop-tarts?

07:44.950 --> 07:46.290
Not too shabs.

07:46.300 --> 07:48.640
Short for shabby. Hilarious.

07:48.650 --> 07:50.110
This could be your life too,liz.

07:50.150 --> 07:51.890
Just short the housing market.

07:51.920 --> 07:55.350
Or write a cookbook specifically
for mixed-race children.

07:55.370 --> 07:57.640
Or marry a rich, old dude who dies.

07:57.670 --> 07:59.140
Clive,i wanna say?

07:59.170 --> 08:02.120
Or have mild lupus and great insurance.

08:02.130 --> 08:03.830
So,here is the plan for today.

08:03.860 --> 08:06.010
- Start with facials and massages...
- Yes,please.

08:06.020 --> 08:07.620
Then private shopping at bergdorf,

08:07.630 --> 08:11.180
- swing by the dermatologist
for a tune-up. - Fabulous.

08:11.190 --> 08:13.970
Dinner at jewel bako,
then a nightcap back here.

08:13.990 --> 08:16.780
Wow,that is a plan.

08:16.790 --> 08:18.380
But,uh,i don't think I should go.

08:18.410 --> 08:21.490
Oh,liz is still stressed
about her old job.

08:22.530 --> 08:26.420
It's just-- it's friday,and at
my job that is our biggest day.

08:26.450 --> 08:28.360
I don't think i'd be good company.

08:28.370 --> 08:31.380
But thank you for inviting
me. I'll have one drink here.

08:31.390 --> 08:33.400
Have two.

08:33.409 --> 08:35.720
But then I really should
go home, 'cause i,you know--

08:35.730 --> 08:40.280
I'm still in work mode, I'm
not really in spa/shopping mode.

08:40.640 --> 08:42.890
I wouldn't be able to enjoy myself.

08:42.900 --> 08:46.160
And I don't wanna crash your
day together and ruin it.

08:46.170 --> 08:47.680
- We're always together.
- Thank you.

08:47.690 --> 08:49.110
Cocktails.

08:49.120 --> 08:53.640
It's just so stressful thinking aut my
employees trying to do everything without me.

08:53.650 --> 08:56.690
- Those look great on you.
- Then I'm buying them.

08:57.590 --> 08:59.790
I guess I'm just one of
those people that needs work.

08:59.800 --> 09:02.600
You know,i
thrive there.I--

09:02.610 --> 09:04.730
- and it's gone just like that?
- Just like that.

09:04.740 --> 09:07.290
- Thank you,dr. Binderman.
- ***

09:07.300 --> 09:10.450
My point is,you are
so sweet to include me.

09:10.490 --> 09:15.470
Believe me,I'm jealous, but
today's just not the day.

09:15.490 --> 09:19.210
So,you know,i'll hang out
with you guys for a little bit,

09:19.220 --> 09:21.510
and i'll have my one drink,and...

09:21.520 --> 09:23.310
- What time is it?
- Almost midnight.

09:23.320 --> 09:27.100
If we're gonna get up in time for our
mani/pedis, we really should turn in.

09:27.890 --> 09:29.440
Bye.

09:31.910 --> 09:34.450
I forgot to watch my show.

09:37.070 --> 09:38.860
I'm prepared to do a
nipple slip if you need it.

09:38.870 --> 09:40.040
Just talk about the movie.

09:40.060 --> 09:42.210
Hi,I'm ethan fromnick magazine.

09:42.240 --> 09:45.000
- Whose mom are you?
- Thank you. Well,tonight's about fun.

09:45.010 --> 09:48.140
I'm wearing taylor dayne for
express, and my peace sign,of course,

09:48.170 --> 09:51.150
- Is a nod to janis joplin, who,I'm
so-- - dora the explorer's backpack!

09:51.160 --> 09:53.620
Backpack, is map in you tonight?

09:57.980 --> 10:00.300
here are your lunches, gentlemen.

10:00.310 --> 10:03.500
Dotcom,i forgot to
get you extra mustard.

10:05.960 --> 10:08.310
All right,enough!

10:08.340 --> 10:10.120
This fighting stops now!

10:10.140 --> 10:13.970
I asorry. Mr. Slattery hurt
me, and now I'm hurting him.

10:13.980 --> 10:15.930
He'll never get mustard.

10:15.950 --> 10:18.490
Except for the mustard that
comes with the sandwich.

10:18.500 --> 10:20.170
I said I was sorry,ken.

10:20.190 --> 10:21.500
I didn't even mean to hurt you.

10:21.530 --> 10:24.220
Oh,really? I love you too,dotcom.

10:24.230 --> 10:27.290
- I didn't say-- - I knew
this would happen someday.

10:27.300 --> 10:29.500
A woman would come between us.

10:29.510 --> 10:32.320
Well,I'm not standing
by. I'm taking action.

10:32.330 --> 10:36.840
Oh,sir,before miss lemon left,i promised
her I wouldn't let you start any adventures.

10:36.860 --> 10:39.090
Yeah,well, liz lemon's in jail now.

10:39.120 --> 10:42.710
And somebody has to step up
and take charge around here.

10:45.510 --> 10:48.280
Let the problem solving begin.

10:49.390 --> 10:52.290
Are you daphne? Yeah,you're fired.

10:52.720 --> 10:56.860
First a backpack upstages me, then the
paparazzi kept calling me dina lohan,

10:56.900 --> 11:00.120
And now the cyrus family has
decided to rock a bunch ofunky hats.

11:00.140 --> 11:01.010
You can't give up now.

11:01.040 --> 11:04.400
Did jackie jormp-jomp give up when
those vampires attacked woodstocks?

11:04.420 --> 11:06.130
Nobody even knows I'm here.

11:06.150 --> 11:11.480
From dreamworks's upcoming feature
film on top of spaghetti, helen mirren.

11:13.030 --> 11:14.900
Good evening.

11:14.920 --> 11:17.390
And now we
take a moment--

11:21.190 --> 11:22.750
oh,that's horrible.

11:22.760 --> 11:24.780
You got me.

11:25.070 --> 11:30.830
And now we take a moment to remember those we
lost this year in the kid entertainment industry.

11:32.830 --> 11:34.650
<i>******</i>

11:34.660 --> 11:38.150
<i>R******</i>

11:38.160 --> 11:41.360
<i>E******</i>

11:41.370 --> 11:42.980
<i>J******</i>

11:42.990 --> 11:44.630
Was that me?

11:44.640 --> 11:46.320
Did they just say I'm dead?

11:46.350 --> 11:47.980
I thought you spoke to the producers.

11:47.990 --> 11:51.120
Look,connor,if we don't get some
traction, jenna maroney's picture's dead.

11:51.160 --> 11:54.630
- We need your help.
- Maroney. Picture. Dead. Got it.

11:54.640 --> 11:56.520
This is a disaster.

11:56.530 --> 12:00.590
No,no. We hit the jackpot.

12:06.110 --> 12:08.670
You being dead is the best thing
that ever happened to this movie.

12:08.680 --> 12:12.660
- Jenna. I wanna tupac you.
- Fine. But I have to pee first.

12:12.670 --> 12:15.330
No. No,no,no, tupac shakur,the rapper.

12:15.340 --> 12:18.390
He sold ten times more albums when
he was dead than when he was alive.

12:18.430 --> 12:19.770
That's what we're going
to do with this movie.

12:19.800 --> 12:22.420
Die young,become a
legend. Just like janis.

12:22.430 --> 12:25.540
Or rusty,the bear fromthe magicals.

12:25.910 --> 12:30.230
Yes. Now... You just need to
stay dead while I sell the movie.

12:30.240 --> 12:31.420
Oh,i can play dead.

12:31.450 --> 12:34.290
I watched my whole church
group get eaten by a bear.

12:41.640 --> 12:43.300
Congratulations,miss lemon.

12:43.320 --> 12:45.620
You've completed your
sensitivity traing.

12:45.630 --> 12:49.760
Your suspension is up, and
here is your certificate.

12:49.790 --> 12:53.300
Wow,so I can go back to work tomorrow?

12:53.310 --> 12:54.580
That's soon.

12:54.600 --> 12:58.100
Well,i know how eager
you are to return to work.

12:58.110 --> 12:59.430
I guess so.

12:59.450 --> 13:02.090
But coming back to
work isn't always easy.

13:02.110 --> 13:04.180
Work means stress.

13:04.190 --> 13:07.490
And stress can make you
fall back on old behavior.

13:07.520 --> 13:11.340
So tonight, I want you to
really think about th d back.

13:11.370 --> 13:13.990
Visualize everything that's facing you.

13:14.020 --> 13:20.390
Think about walking through that door and immediately
dealing with 100 different problems and responsibilities.

13:20.840 --> 13:24.620
Your coworkers' demands
on you, the long hours,

13:24.630 --> 13:27.940
the pointless meetings
and endless phone calls.

13:27.970 --> 13:30.570
Think of the frustration, the futility,

13:30.600 --> 13:35.960
and the time That you will never get back
as you creep closer and closer to the grave.

13:37.380 --> 13:40.940
Okay. Any questions for me?

13:41.370 --> 13:42.740
Just one.

13:42.760 --> 13:46.260
Why don't you drop those dockers
and gimme a piece of that sweet ass?

13:46.930 --> 13:50.250
- What're we doing today,ladies?
- More of the same.

13:58.800 --> 14:01.630
- Chell-o? - Lemon,what the hell
happened at your reinstatement hearing?

14:01.640 --> 14:03.880
Jeffrey weener-slave said you
put your fingers in his mouth.

14:03.910 --> 14:07.230
Did i? Or did he put
his mouth on my fingers?

14:07.240 --> 14:10.960
It's gonna take at least six weeks
paid leave to g to the bottom of this.

14:10.980 --> 14:13.450
I'm very busy right now faking
jenna's death to sell her movie.

14:13.480 --> 14:15.840
I'm not going to engage on that. Mantra.

14:15.850 --> 14:18.110
But I am calling h.r.and getting
you back for the next show.

14:18.150 --> 14:21.310
No,i just-- I need a little more
time off. I'm on humanity leave.

14:21.320 --> 14:23.770
Good god,what indigo
girls song is that from?

14:23.810 --> 14:26.830
Syllabus of usoff
vagabonds,martyrs,and quilts.

14:26.840 --> 14:31.500
The point is I have met the
most amazing group of women,jack.

14:31.530 --> 14:33.080
They just live.

14:33.110 --> 14:36.460
And they spin every morning,
and they go to museums.

14:36.470 --> 14:38.730
- Lemon,you are not a rich divorcee.
- I know.

14:38.740 --> 14:41.620
But I have some money
saved-- enough for two years.

14:41.660 --> 14:43.440
Maybe four if I give up cable.

14:43.470 --> 14:46.560
So I will me back to
the show in four years.

14:46.590 --> 14:48.520
You're fooling yourself. You
know you can't live like that.

14:48.530 --> 14:51.330
Yes,i can. Emily and
her friends are happy.

14:51.340 --> 14:53.620
Believe me,there is no
solace in their luxury.

14:53.650 --> 14:54.710
Only deep despair.

14:54.730 --> 14:57.060
How do you know all
these indigo girls songs?

14:57.070 --> 14:59.480
Listen,you are wrong about emily.

14:59.500 --> 15:02.530
Oh,god,there's a spider
nest in my yo mat!

15:02.540 --> 15:05.780
Mr. Jordan. Mr. Jordan,what did you do?

15:05.790 --> 15:07.340
You fired daphne?

15:07.380 --> 15:08.420
I had to.

15:08.460 --> 15:12.120
Friendship and trust in the
entourage is the most important thing.

15:12.140 --> 15:15.110
Like that hbo show. John adams.

15:15.120 --> 15:18.690
- Well,me and dotcom are back to
being best friends. - We were never--

15:18.700 --> 15:23.020
but the other dancers are refusing to
come to work out of solidarity with daphne.

15:23.440 --> 15:29.080
Usually,this is the point in my process when
liz lemon steps in and takes care of everything.

15:29.090 --> 15:32.050
Heavy is the head that eats the crayons.

15:32.070 --> 15:34.920
I'm gonna take a nap.
See you in ten hours.

15:36.170 --> 15:39.140
Kenneth. Have any of the
dancers come in yet today?

15:40.150 --> 15:42.200
Pete. A word.

15:42.860 --> 15:46.150
- Jenna's dead.
- I don't feel anything.

15:46.420 --> 15:50.340
- What's wrong with me?
- No,no, it's a marketing ploy. For her new movie.

15:50.350 --> 15:52.990
But it mns you won't have
her for the show on friday.

15:53.000 --> 15:56.100
And you need to put together
some sort of on-air tribute.

15:56.120 --> 15:58.630
We actually already have
an obituary reel for jenna.

15:58.660 --> 16:01.220
We put it together after
she cheated on that mobster.

16:01.230 --> 16:03.050
That's good.

16:03.320 --> 16:06.790
Oh,eating right, working out,sleeping...

16:06.820 --> 16:10.200
Bm-ing like a rock star?

16:10.920 --> 16:13.910
All right,all right. What's
the hump day schedule look like?

16:13.920 --> 16:17.580
Oh,it's esy, liz,it's thursday.

16:18.060 --> 16:20.800
I read somewhere it's tuesday.

16:21.900 --> 16:25.950
Mr. Jordan,it's friday. We really need to
tell mr. Hornberger that the dancers quit.

16:25.960 --> 16:29.210
No we don't. He's not even
gonna notice they're gone.

16:30.260 --> 16:32.930
- Oh,my.
- These are the new dancers,kid.

16:32.940 --> 16:35.350
- Say hi to velvet.
- Hello,miss velvet.

16:36.110 --> 16:39.240
Just think,an hour ago they
were brawling in a parking lot,

16:39.270 --> 16:41.450
But tonight, they're gonna be stars.

16:41.490 --> 16:44.010
Show ken here what we worked on.

16:48.500 --> 16:50.330
Oh,boy.

16:50.370 --> 16:56.260
Oh,boy, I am really starting to feel the
benefits of massages and yoga five days a week.

16:56.510 --> 16:58.410
Check this out.

17:01.770 --> 17:03.410
Look at you.

17:03.450 --> 17:06.210
Last week you were flipping
out about missing work.

17:06.250 --> 17:09.359
Oh,no,that's old liz.

17:09.839 --> 17:14.400
My boss kept trying to tell me that I would go
crazy living a life of leisure,That it's unhe

17:14.410 --> 17:16.640
well,he's actually right.

17:16.660 --> 17:18.290
No,no,he's not,emily.

17:18.319 --> 17:23.119
No,i used to be a neurosurgeon before
jasmine guy and I wrote our cookbook,

17:23.170 --> 17:26.369
And the human brain needs
stimulation or it atrophies.

17:26.410 --> 17:29.650
And your pleasure
center literally shrinks.

17:29.660 --> 17:32.670
That's why we do our special activity.

17:32.710 --> 17:34.080
To combat that.

17:34.120 --> 17:36.610
What,like,sudoku?

17:37.170 --> 17:40.640
uh,we did a games night for a
couple of weeks. Didn't last.

17:40.650 --> 17:41.760
So charity work?

17:41.780 --> 17:45.500
No,charity work sucks.

17:45.540 --> 17:48.200
- Should we tell her?
- Erin,it's too soon.

17:48.210 --> 17:50.760
- Punch me in the face,liz.
- I'm sorry,what?

17:51.600 --> 17:53.860
You heard me.Punch
me as hard as you can,

17:53.870 --> 17:57.250
and then I am coming
at you like an animal.

17:57.260 --> 17:59.880
Oh,god, is this a fight club?

17:59.920 --> 18:02.390
The pain provese're alive.

18:02.410 --> 18:05.290
Oh,this is very dispointing!

18:05.320 --> 18:07.760
Come on,hit me. Get a taste.

18:07.770 --> 18:09.940
I brought a roll of
quarters to hold in my fist.

18:09.970 --> 18:12.300
Oh,god. Jack was right.

18:12.620 --> 18:14.460
Oh,i have to get back to my show.

18:14.480 --> 18:16.680
- I need the show.
- You want out,liz?

18:16.690 --> 18:19.260
You're gonna have to fight your way out.

18:20.260 --> 18:22.500
As we celebrate the
life of jenna maroney...

18:22.530 --> 18:26.740
The coast guard won't officially declare her
dead yet, but what the pirates did to that boat!

18:27.010 --> 18:29.480
Well,it's a very generous
offer. We'll be in touch.

18:31.120 --> 18:32.680
Jenna,what the hell are you doing here?

18:32.690 --> 18:33.930
They're talking about me.

18:33.950 --> 18:35.800
I'm really better today.

18:35.820 --> 18:39.350
So's the laundry, *******

18:40.370 --> 18:42.850
that was some of jenna
maroney's earlier work.

18:42.870 --> 18:45.850
It's hard to believe that both
of those women outlived her.

18:45.880 --> 18:48.190
Especially the woman on the right.

18:48.230 --> 18:50.660
We'll be right back.

18:50.670 --> 18:52.450
A coupla gay guys were crying.

18:52.490 --> 18:54.630
Oh,jack,thiss just the
greatest night of my--

18:54.640 --> 18:57.130
What the hell is that?

18:57.620 --> 18:58.810
Well,it's you. What's the problem?

18:58.820 --> 19:01.480
It has the year I was born on it.

19:01.520 --> 19:03.900
Therealyear, not the actress year.

19:03.940 --> 19:07.470
Now almost a million people
are gonna know that I'm f-- f--

19:07.780 --> 19:10.170
- It's too late to change it,jack.
- Jenna,calm down.

19:10.180 --> 19:12.690
I'm selling the movie in the
next 12 hours. Your movie.

19:12.700 --> 19:15.150
Think about what matters here.

19:15.360 --> 19:19.220
In five,four,three...

19:19.230 --> 19:22.960
And finally tonight, what more fitting
way to say good-bye to our friend

19:22.970 --> 19:25.370
than with the gifts
she gave all of us...

19:25.410 --> 19:27.030
Her music.

19:27.070 --> 19:32.640
Ladies and gentlemen, itzhak
bemelmans and the tracy jordan dancers.

19:37.370 --> 19:40.170
Gimme me a microphone.

19:40.180 --> 19:46.800
* Whole grain,low fat I
know you want a piece of that

19:46.810 --> 19:49.730
* but I just wanna dance

19:49.740 --> 19:52.690
still alive.Not yet 32.
Sorry,jack. Worth it.

19:54.030 --> 19:56.540
- I'm back.
- What did it turn out to be? Lesbians?

19:56.550 --> 19:58.710
No. Fight club.

20:02.120 --> 20:03.860
this this is a disaster.

20:03.870 --> 20:06.440
* But I'm just here to dance

20:06.450 --> 20:08.570
what is wrong with you two?

20:08.580 --> 20:13.130
You guys mess up everything you touch,
and then I have to come in here and fix it.

20:13.180 --> 20:16.150
- I am so mad.
- Why are you smiling?

20:16.440 --> 20:17.720
You're freaking me out.

20:17.750 --> 20:20.310
Oh,you two troublemakers. Come here!

20:20.320 --> 20:23.270
- She's gonna do something to us.
- You're crazy!

20:34.120 --> 20:36.360
I'm back,nerds.
