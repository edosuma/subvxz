00:12.846 --> 00:14.635
Do I just pour the broth
into the noodles?

00:14.669 --> 00:15.686
No!

00:16.617 --> 00:18.553
Don't mess with this noodle.

00:20.722 --> 00:22.789
Only dip.

00:30.463 --> 00:32.433
Ooh, chopsticks.
I know how to use these.

00:32.466 --> 00:34.201
Me too.

00:34.235 --> 00:35.469
We have one order of tsukemen.

00:35.503 --> 00:37.238
- Oh.
- Tsukemen?

00:37.271 --> 00:39.506
These are our cold
Japanese dipping noodles.

00:39.540 --> 00:40.774
More garnishes will be coming out.

00:40.808 --> 00:42.610
I don't think this is what we ordered.

00:42.643 --> 00:45.414
We don't work here.
A-are you asking us to make it?

00:45.445 --> 00:46.814
Yeah. We're not chefs.

00:46.847 --> 00:48.417
Oh, I think what we ordered
"Sookie-man."

00:48.448 --> 00:49.851
- It's pronounced tsukemen.
- Tsukemen?

00:49.884 --> 00:51.820
- Enjoy.
- What... but... do you want to

00:51.851 --> 00:53.488
send this back to the kitchen

00:53.521 --> 00:55.356
so you guys can make it
and then bring it back?

00:55.389 --> 00:57.258
Why do I have a blank soup? Okay.

00:57.290 --> 00:58.692
Well, I don't even have a soup.

00:58.726 --> 00:59.860
Why are there n-naked noodles?

00:59.893 --> 01:01.729
I'm gonna start with the salad.

01:01.762 --> 01:03.264
But I think there's
a-a proper way to do it that...

01:03.296 --> 01:04.531
It's All edible.

01:04.563 --> 01:05.966
Nance, this is, like, Asian food.

01:06.001 --> 01:07.602
This is... you've got to do it
like they do it

01:07.635 --> 01:09.938
in... in an actual country.

01:09.971 --> 01:11.739
Well, hon, I'm hungry.

01:11.772 --> 01:13.509
No. No! That's the dressing?

01:13.540 --> 01:14.977
- I...
- I think that's the soup.

01:15.010 --> 01:16.710
- It's not a soup.
- Le... let's do this

01:16.745 --> 01:17.980
the right way. What... what... what...

01:18.013 --> 01:20.347
Mmm.

01:20.382 --> 01:22.251
Peter, now my favorite dress
has a stain on it.

01:22.283 --> 01:25.254
What's that?

01:25.287 --> 01:27.689
Th... th... this is not a soup.

01:27.722 --> 01:30.858
Help! Hel... p-p... please,
can... can someone help?

01:30.891 --> 01:33.262
So w... we don't know how
to do any of this.

01:33.293 --> 01:34.495
There's a proper way to do it.

01:34.528 --> 01:35.730
You simply take your noodles

01:35.764 --> 01:36.998
and dip them into your broth.

01:37.031 --> 01:38.299
What are you doing? Tying a knot?

01:38.331 --> 01:39.901
Yeah, I'm making a dumpling.

01:39.933 --> 01:41.335
It's reAlly important
that you don't let your noodles

01:41.370 --> 01:42.871
soak in the broth.

01:42.903 --> 01:44.939
And... and the eggs
are for breakfast for tomorrow?

01:44.972 --> 01:46.373
For a little bit more richness.

01:46.406 --> 01:47.808
Gives it more mouth feel.

01:47.841 --> 01:49.710
It's kinda like a tea ceremony for food.

01:49.745 --> 01:51.278
These flavors have been around
for centuries,

01:51.311 --> 01:52.914
so we're honoring them today.

01:52.948 --> 01:55.582
And what century wh... wh... wh...
does the flavor come from?

01:55.616 --> 01:57.718
Peter, while you're talking,
I'm about to eat food.

01:57.752 --> 01:59.920
I'm just gonna put All this in here.

01:59.954 --> 02:01.956
No! Only dip!

02:01.989 --> 02:03.792
You've been warned.

02:03.823 --> 02:05.659
Wow. Hot-headed.

02:05.692 --> 02:07.763
Could we get this to go, please?

02:09.497 --> 02:11.899
Oh, Peter, there's so many containers.

02:11.931 --> 02:13.901
I'm not gonna be able
to fit it All in here, hon.

02:13.933 --> 02:16.336
Sure. You just move that
bottle right over there.

02:16.371 --> 02:18.438
ActuAlly, why don't you
throw this milk out?

02:18.473 --> 02:20.575
I'm not gonna throw it out.
I don't want to waste it.

02:20.609 --> 02:22.377
Just drink it.

02:22.409 --> 02:25.045
Oh.

02:25.079 --> 02:26.713
It's like cottage cheese.

02:26.747 --> 02:28.383
Look, I just combined
everything so it should fit.

02:28.415 --> 02:29.985
No, no, no, no.
I-I-I-I don't think you sup...

02:30.016 --> 02:31.419
- Yep.
- I don't think that's

02:31.451 --> 02:32.819
- the right thing to do.
- All good.

02:32.853 --> 02:33.956
I think... keep them separate.

02:33.989 --> 02:35.858
Nance, I-I don't... I don't...

03:00.046 --> 03:02.883
- Aah!
- You didn't dip, Nance!

03:02.918 --> 03:06.086
What happened?

03:06.121 --> 03:08.088
It was just...
just a bad dream, I guess.

03:08.122 --> 03:09.924
Oh, no.

03:27.943 --> 03:29.610
Good morning. As you know,

03:29.644 --> 03:32.813
the Nokia Corporation
is gonna be visiting today,

03:32.848 --> 03:35.350
and they're looking to
potentiAlly open a plant here,

03:35.384 --> 03:38.020
which would mean
thousands of new local jobs.

03:38.051 --> 03:40.521
We reAlly want everything
to be especiAlly polished today.

03:40.555 --> 03:42.022
Spick-and-span.

03:42.057 --> 03:43.759
The mayor wants this to go
reAlly, reAlly well.

03:46.795 --> 03:49.531
OPP Radio, I'm Gregory Gonzalez Gomez.

03:49.562 --> 03:51.365
And I am Brianne Maxwell Jones,

03:51.400 --> 03:53.735
and we are right in the middle
of our spring pledge drive.

03:53.769 --> 03:55.871
We've got a goal of $50,000

03:55.902 --> 03:57.070
Think of it as an investment

03:57.103 --> 03:59.439
in your own entertainment and education.

03:59.473 --> 04:01.143
The other day, we ha...
we had a driveway moment.

04:01.175 --> 04:02.411
There was a wonderful story

04:02.443 --> 04:04.045
on teenagers in Papua, New Guinea

04:04.079 --> 04:05.948
who sell sand.

04:05.979 --> 04:08.049
Here in public radio, a driveway moment

04:08.081 --> 04:09.884
is something that defines who we are.

04:09.918 --> 04:11.652
You're in your car, listening to a show,

04:11.686 --> 04:13.086
and you're almost at your house.

04:13.121 --> 04:15.389
You pull up, and you don't want
to spend that time

04:15.424 --> 04:16.959
going from your car to your house

04:16.990 --> 04:20.394
and missing the very important
part of the story.

04:20.427 --> 04:23.163
So you stay in your car
until the story is over.

04:23.197 --> 04:26.668
And what we're asking for today
is for you to donate

04:26.699 --> 04:30.571
to keep this community of
public radio listeners going.

04:30.603 --> 04:32.406
Through your pledges, we brought in

04:32.439 --> 04:34.375
the new Beck album and we played it f...

04:38.077 --> 04:40.047
- Oh, damn it.
- What?

04:41.781 --> 04:43.584
I left my phone at home.

04:43.617 --> 04:45.687
- Let's go back.
- I can't believe I did that!

04:45.718 --> 04:48.456
It was right on the counter.
Just... it was... I looked at it,

04:48.488 --> 04:50.425
and I just kept walking. Damn it!

04:50.459 --> 04:52.528
Ugh. We'll just leave it.

04:52.560 --> 04:55.497
Okay.

05:01.502 --> 05:03.069
Ahem.

05:03.103 --> 05:04.838
I bet you someone's texting me
right now.

05:04.872 --> 05:07.543
Like right now, they're, like,
"Hey, how are you doing?"

05:07.574 --> 05:10.511
honestly, it's often one of
those things where you get back,

05:10.543 --> 05:11.711
and you think there's been an emergency,

05:11.745 --> 05:13.447
and there's literAlly nothing.

05:13.480 --> 05:14.581
The texts that I want to return,

05:14.615 --> 05:16.151
they're not the important ones,

05:16.182 --> 05:17.617
but the ones where someone's
like, "Hey, what's up?"

05:17.651 --> 05:18.853
And it just seems like I'm mad at them.

05:18.887 --> 05:20.521
And I don't want anyone to think that.

05:20.553 --> 05:22.589
Ugh.

05:22.622 --> 05:25.192
I miss the heat of it in my pocket.

05:27.961 --> 05:30.630
Konichiwa. Today on "Asia-phile,"

05:30.663 --> 05:34.502
we're going to talk about
the various ways you can bow.

05:34.536 --> 05:37.038
And in dealing with, uh,
business colleagues,

05:37.072 --> 05:38.507
you should know the difference between

05:38.538 --> 05:40.007
the formal and informal bows,

05:40.040 --> 05:43.711
and know when to use
the very, very formal.

05:43.744 --> 05:46.079
Let's bow, shAll we?

05:46.113 --> 05:48.081
Here's me doing the formal bow.

05:48.115 --> 05:50.050
Look at my back.

05:50.084 --> 05:52.586
Here's me doing the informal.

05:52.620 --> 05:54.088
- Nokia's here, sir.
- Hmm? Good.

05:54.120 --> 05:56.057
Konichiwa.

05:59.959 --> 06:01.095
Where are the Nokia people?

06:01.127 --> 06:03.630
Apparently that's them.

06:03.663 --> 06:05.098
I thought it was a Japanese company.

06:05.132 --> 06:08.603
ActuAlly, Mr. Mayor,
we are a Finnish company.

06:08.637 --> 06:10.680
- Tracy Bing, Nokia.
- Nokia.

06:10.713 --> 06:13.108
Jim and I, here, are heads
of Nokia North America.

06:13.139 --> 06:14.809
- Hi. Jim Riggins.
- Wow.

06:14.841 --> 06:18.045
You are not exactly
what I was expecting at All.

06:18.077 --> 06:19.547
So it's not a Japanese company?

06:19.579 --> 06:21.581
No, sir. It's a Finnish company.

06:21.615 --> 06:22.817
- Finnish?
- Finnish.

06:22.850 --> 06:23.985
- Finland.
- So wouldn't it be,

06:24.018 --> 06:26.920
- like, "Nu-kea"?
- Nokia.

06:26.954 --> 06:32.127
Well, I prepared an elaborate
Japanese welcoming bow ceremony.

06:32.158 --> 06:34.928
I reAlly, reAlly, reAlly
did a lot of work on it, but...

06:34.961 --> 06:37.031
Go ahead. Do it anyway.

06:53.314 --> 06:55.317
Tracy, Jim, welcome.

06:55.348 --> 06:58.252
I'm so excited to show you
the bright, eager,

06:58.286 --> 06:59.954
young workforce that we have here.

06:59.987 --> 07:02.790
I have no doubt you will choose
Portland as your home.

07:02.822 --> 07:04.625
Kind of curious,
who else are you considering?

07:04.658 --> 07:05.961
Seattle.

07:05.992 --> 07:08.663
No contest. Bunch of dum-dums up there.

07:09.762 --> 07:12.867
Nance? The fridge is wide open.

07:12.899 --> 07:15.970
- What?
- Want anything for lunch?

07:16.002 --> 07:18.072
I could go for
some of those leftovers, hon.

07:18.105 --> 07:19.675
The noodles are gone.

07:19.706 --> 07:21.341
No, hon, they're on the shelf.

07:21.375 --> 07:23.343
No, they're not.
They're... they're not here.

07:23.377 --> 07:25.312
Well, Peter, they didn't
just get up and walk away.

07:25.346 --> 07:28.014
I-I-I-I think they did.

07:28.048 --> 07:30.685
There's little noodle footprints
that go out the... the...

07:30.718 --> 07:33.021
the front of the fridge
and they... they make a left

07:33.052 --> 07:35.156
and go down the hAll
and there's broth everywhere.

07:35.189 --> 07:37.058
You didn't dip.

07:51.105 --> 07:53.141
Ah!

07:53.173 --> 07:55.843
Ahh!

07:55.875 --> 07:56.911
Ahh!

07:57.978 --> 07:59.713
Ahh!

08:04.651 --> 08:05.800
Ah, damn it. Right on my shirt.

08:05.834 --> 08:08.569
It's gonna be there All day. Oh, well.

08:09.521 --> 08:12.956
Oh, God. Now I have to get
this shirt dry-cleaned.

08:13.994 --> 08:16.795
What you're going to see here
is a potential workforce

08:16.829 --> 08:18.565
the likes of which
doesn't exist anywhere else.

08:18.598 --> 08:20.132
Only in Portland.

08:20.165 --> 08:22.668
You see All the busy little bees
working away on projects,

08:22.701 --> 08:23.968
All personal projects.

08:24.002 --> 08:25.838
Why shouldn't they be working for you?

08:25.872 --> 08:27.374
Hmm?

08:27.406 --> 08:28.574
Let's talk to one of them, shAll we?

08:28.608 --> 08:29.975
Excuse me? Hi.

08:30.009 --> 08:31.644
- Oh, hi. Nice to meet you.
- I'm the mayor.

08:31.677 --> 08:33.879
I see you're working hard there on a...

08:33.913 --> 08:37.384
- uh, you've got a little spill.
- Oh, yeah.

08:37.417 --> 08:40.451
We couldn't have a spill like
that around the office.

08:40.485 --> 08:42.086
- Well, you keep working.
- Oh, okay.

08:42.120 --> 08:43.822
There you go. Thank you.

08:43.855 --> 08:46.625
- Sir, hi. I'm the mayor.
- Oh, hi.

08:46.658 --> 08:49.062
- Ugh.
- A stain.

08:49.095 --> 08:52.131
Um...

08:54.100 --> 08:55.668
- Oh.
- These people are slobs.

08:55.701 --> 08:57.437
We can't have that in the office.

08:57.470 --> 08:58.903
I don't think Portland's
gonna work for us.

08:58.937 --> 09:00.105
- Mm-mm.
- Uh, well,

09:00.139 --> 09:01.841
let's, uh, let's get you in.

09:01.874 --> 09:05.879
Now, uh, I know Nokia is in need
of strong workforce.

09:08.879 --> 09:10.416
I don't know what to do with my hands.

09:10.450 --> 09:12.818
Just... like this.

09:12.850 --> 09:16.087
Reach in my pocket... back pocket.

09:16.120 --> 09:19.725
Wish I had a...

09:19.759 --> 09:22.761
You know, I wish I had rings
I could play with on my fingers.

09:22.793 --> 09:24.071
That's what I should do is try to get...

09:24.096 --> 09:26.009
Whoa, a lot of people are
tweeting about this wet noodle

09:26.033 --> 09:28.100
- that's on a rampage.
- I'm that out of it already?

09:28.134 --> 09:29.836
Yeah. Sightings downtown.
Sightings like...

09:29.869 --> 09:32.205
Ahh!

09:43.749 --> 09:47.120
Okay, we're getting breaking
news on a noodle monster

09:47.153 --> 09:48.687
of some kind.

09:48.721 --> 09:50.923
We will try, if we can,

09:50.956 --> 09:54.793
my finger is on the button
to switch over to that story.

09:55.927 --> 09:58.596
Just waiting for that $50,000.

09:58.629 --> 10:00.097
Brianne's finger is on the button,

10:00.130 --> 10:01.833
and we're almost gonna do the switch,

10:01.866 --> 10:03.836
but we just need that $50,000.

10:03.870 --> 10:06.940
And in fact, this in itself
can be a driveway moment,

10:06.971 --> 10:08.942
but we need your funds.

10:08.975 --> 10:13.011
Donate anything. $5, $10, 20,
50, anything you can.

10:13.043 --> 10:14.514
And if you're like Scrooge McDuck,

10:14.547 --> 10:16.216
and you're, like, swimming in money

10:16.249 --> 10:17.783
in, like, a real pool full of, like,

10:17.817 --> 10:21.822
very bright yellow gold coins,
please contribute.

10:24.123 --> 10:27.759
It is our fault. We take responsibility.

10:27.793 --> 10:29.995
We birthed this monster
with our ignorance.

10:30.028 --> 10:31.730
Excuse me, do you plan to apologize

10:31.764 --> 10:33.566
to the chefs of this city
whom you've just embarrassed

10:33.599 --> 10:35.601
- by your faux pas?
- Yes.

10:35.634 --> 10:37.870
We're... we're... we...
we have a statement

10:37.903 --> 10:41.072
to a... All chefs in...
in our wonderful city,

10:41.105 --> 10:43.140
we apologize with...
with our full heart and body...

10:43.173 --> 10:44.976
Are you going to apologize to homeowners

10:45.009 --> 10:47.111
whose homes have been ruined
by this noodle monster?

10:47.144 --> 10:50.948
To ho... homeowners out there,
if you're watching,

10:50.981 --> 10:52.584
we're... we're so sorry.

10:52.616 --> 10:54.519
Are you going to apologize
to the apartment dwellers

10:54.552 --> 10:55.754
who you just left out?

10:55.788 --> 10:57.056
Apartment dwellers, we are so sorry.

10:57.087 --> 11:00.893
And if you're in 10A or in 15K...

11:00.927 --> 11:03.929
Are you going to apologize
for the rising rent?

11:03.961 --> 11:07.198
We're sorry.

11:10.003 --> 11:11.238
Thank you, Sam.

11:11.269 --> 11:13.940
Please just have a seat right here,

11:13.972 --> 11:15.640
- and I'll be right back.
- Everything's okay?

11:15.673 --> 11:19.211
Yes. Just a minor hiccup.
Sam, could you, uh...

11:21.679 --> 11:23.815
So...

11:23.849 --> 11:27.320
we got some crazy monster movie
on our hands here.

11:27.352 --> 11:30.855
Chef, what exactly are we dealing with?

11:30.888 --> 11:33.191
Mr. Mayor, this is tsukemen.

11:33.224 --> 11:34.893
It's a cold Japanese wheat noodle

11:34.926 --> 11:36.761
for dipping in ramen broth.

11:36.794 --> 11:38.630
I... I'm sorry. I didn't have
a chance to look any of this...

11:38.663 --> 11:40.197
I don't have my phone with me,

11:40.231 --> 11:43.168
so why would a noodle increase in size

11:43.201 --> 11:45.003
and then attack a city?

11:45.037 --> 11:46.806
So the thing is, if it's dipped,

11:46.838 --> 11:48.273
it's a delicious dish.

11:48.306 --> 11:50.008
But if it's soaked in the broth,

11:50.040 --> 11:51.676
it turns into a monster.

11:51.710 --> 11:53.144
What does it want?
What does this noodle want?

11:53.177 --> 11:55.080
It just wants to be dipped.

11:55.114 --> 11:57.616
But it's gotten dunked.
It's gotten dunked and soaked.

11:57.649 --> 11:58.682
So the noodle wanted a shower,

11:58.716 --> 12:00.351
but someone gave it a bath.

12:00.385 --> 12:02.989
As if the noodle has been
baptized against its will.

12:03.022 --> 12:04.255
Why isn't it rice?

12:04.288 --> 12:06.057
Why didn't rice happen? Why is it...

12:06.090 --> 12:07.993
It's... it's a wheat noodle from wheat.

12:08.027 --> 12:11.897
Not a rice noodle from rice.

12:11.929 --> 12:13.633
- You need to get your phone.
- I don't have a phone.

12:13.666 --> 12:14.933
You guys All have your phones with you.

12:14.966 --> 12:15.933
I don't have mine, okay?

12:15.967 --> 12:17.135
So the... my little brain

12:17.168 --> 12:18.403
is trying to come up with solutions...

12:18.436 --> 12:20.306
- I don't... chopstick guns.
- We tried that.

12:20.338 --> 12:21.974
How... how are we gonna deal with this?

12:22.006 --> 12:24.275
I mean, I want it dealt with
humanely, of course.

12:24.308 --> 12:25.878
No one gets hurt, including the noodle,

12:25.911 --> 12:28.346
but we have to deal with it. Any ideas?

12:28.379 --> 12:30.282
Maybe we could take
one of our city pools

12:30.315 --> 12:31.750
and fill it with ramen broth.

12:31.783 --> 12:34.119
Then we get the noodle and we dip it,

12:34.152 --> 12:36.326
turns it back into a delicious dish.

12:36.360 --> 12:38.024
- That's a great idea.
- A quick dip.

12:38.056 --> 12:40.892
- Quick dip.
- A quick dip.

12:40.926 --> 12:43.361
We've got to forcibly
get it into this pool of broth.

12:43.394 --> 12:44.928
I think I know people

12:44.962 --> 12:48.134
that are good at pushing things
into pools.

12:50.368 --> 12:52.238
- Frat guys.
- Yeah?

12:52.270 --> 12:54.706
We need you to push the
noodle monster into the water.

12:54.739 --> 12:55.974
- We could do that. Okay.
- Yeah.

12:56.008 --> 12:57.176
Don't you guys want to be heroes?

12:57.209 --> 12:58.277
Do you guys want to be heroes?

12:58.309 --> 12:59.344
- You guys hear that?
- Yeah.

12:59.378 --> 13:00.378
Do we agree on that?

13:00.412 --> 13:02.681
- Perfect!
- Ahh!

13:03.981 --> 13:05.384
My socks are on, buddy.

13:05.416 --> 13:07.352
I've got my phone in my pocket.

13:07.385 --> 13:09.288
So this... this pool thing's
not going to work.

13:10.855 --> 13:12.389
Mayor, could we have a word with you?

13:12.423 --> 13:15.726
Yeah. Excuse me. One second.

13:15.760 --> 13:17.996
We're just about through
with our little hiccup.

13:18.029 --> 13:19.097
Can I get you anything else?

13:19.130 --> 13:21.000
Some magazines or a board game?

13:21.032 --> 13:22.368
ActuAlly, I think we're just
gonna head to the airport.

13:22.400 --> 13:23.802
No.

13:23.835 --> 13:25.136
We feel like we have a good take

13:25.169 --> 13:27.706
on what Portland is,
how it, um, operates,

13:27.739 --> 13:29.139
so thanks very much
for showing us everything.

13:29.173 --> 13:31.076
You reAlly haven't had a chance

13:31.109 --> 13:32.777
to experience All of Portland.

13:32.811 --> 13:34.279
Well, it seems like
you got something pretty big

13:34.312 --> 13:35.980
going on here, so...

13:36.013 --> 13:37.950
Well, we're busy,
but not too busy for you.

13:38.816 --> 13:39.952
Take care.

13:41.452 --> 13:44.088
Allen.

13:47.759 --> 13:50.096
Well,

13:50.895 --> 13:53.032
the Nokia people didn't say it directly,

13:53.865 --> 13:55.767
but I think it would please them

13:55.801 --> 13:59.205
if we destroyed this noodle
once and for All.

14:01.807 --> 14:04.409
Well, I-I just have
an apology hangover right now.

14:04.443 --> 14:05.745
I feel awful.

14:05.778 --> 14:07.581
Well, I'm sorry
you feel that way, Nance.

14:07.613 --> 14:09.682
Well, I'm not sorry
'cause I'm sick of being sorry.

14:09.716 --> 14:13.052
Hey, wh... wh... wh... wh...
where's the fridge?

14:17.054 --> 14:19.024
The stairs are All wet. What's going on?

14:19.057 --> 14:20.460
Ahh!

14:20.491 --> 14:23.529
- Ah!
- We're sorry.

14:23.562 --> 14:24.730
What... what else do you want from us?

14:24.764 --> 14:26.032
You... you want a written apology?

14:26.063 --> 14:27.566
I'm done apologizing.

14:27.599 --> 14:28.734
I don't even know what we did wrong.

14:28.767 --> 14:29.934
Can you hear us?

14:29.967 --> 14:34.106
Maybe he understands
gestures of apology.

14:34.139 --> 14:35.841
I'm not gonna bow to a noodle.

14:35.875 --> 14:38.812
We're... we're sorry. We apologize.

14:38.844 --> 14:39.945
Listen, we've had enough of you.

14:39.977 --> 14:41.846
Just get out of here! Scram!

14:41.880 --> 14:43.649
- Ah! Peter... Peter.
- Ahh!

14:43.682 --> 14:45.519
Get it! Come on!

14:45.551 --> 14:49.922
Ahh! No! Ahh! No!

14:49.955 --> 14:52.490
Oh, ah.

14:52.524 --> 14:56.428
Ahh!

14:56.462 --> 14:57.929
Peter!

14:57.962 --> 15:00.566
Uh, we are closing in
on the noodle monster.

15:00.599 --> 15:02.835
It'll be in range in three minutes.

15:02.868 --> 15:05.703
Great, great. It was last seen, uh,

15:05.736 --> 15:08.808
near Sandy and 33rd.

15:08.841 --> 15:10.110
I think it's heading
back to my restaurant

15:10.142 --> 15:11.777
to suck down some more broth.

15:11.809 --> 15:13.846
Copy that. I've located the target.

15:13.879 --> 15:16.182
I am prepared to lock in and fire.

15:16.216 --> 15:19.186
Excellent. Terminate with
extreme prejudice.

15:19.217 --> 15:20.786
Engaging termination.

15:20.818 --> 15:24.957
I will be firing in 15 seconds.

15:24.990 --> 15:27.461
- Hey!
- Whoa, whoa, hold on, pilot.

15:27.493 --> 15:28.994
Ma'am, what are you doing there?

15:29.027 --> 15:30.229
What is your beef?

15:30.261 --> 15:31.931
We need to exterminate this noodle.

15:31.963 --> 15:33.599
My husband's in there.

15:33.631 --> 15:35.868
He got slurped up.
I need to get him out.

15:35.900 --> 15:37.536
Ma'am, I can't.

15:37.568 --> 15:39.738
The folks from Nokia
are on their way to Seattle,

15:39.770 --> 15:42.006
and they've just seen us with
lots of stains on our shirts.

15:42.039 --> 15:43.241
No, no, no, listen.

15:43.274 --> 15:45.110
I can neutralize the situation.

15:45.144 --> 15:46.980
I can do it humanely.

15:47.011 --> 15:51.717
Please. Please.

15:51.750 --> 15:53.687
You've got two minutes.

15:53.719 --> 15:55.653
Get me NPR.

15:55.687 --> 15:58.792
We are a go for
Operation Driveway Moment.

15:58.823 --> 16:01.193
That's why in this, uh,
pledge drive, we need you...

16:01.226 --> 16:02.794
Out of the chair! Out of the chair!

16:02.827 --> 16:04.230
Move, move, move!
Get up, get up, get up!

16:04.264 --> 16:07.600
Oh, geez.

16:07.633 --> 16:10.635
Okay, okay.

16:10.669 --> 16:12.705
I'm Kai Ryssdal, this is "Marketplace."

16:15.673 --> 16:17.510
So let me tell you
actuAlly a little story.

16:17.543 --> 16:20.111
When I lived in Beijing,
there was a place I went to,

16:20.145 --> 16:21.813
a little noodle shop that I went to

16:21.846 --> 16:24.116
every single day for lunch
we had dondonya,

16:24.149 --> 16:25.750
which if you've never had dondonya,

16:25.784 --> 16:27.586
I cannot recommend it highly enough.

16:27.620 --> 16:30.090
A bowl of noodles steaming hot,

16:30.121 --> 16:32.625
there's some spicy broth on the
bottom, a little pork on top,

16:32.658 --> 16:33.927
some scAllions, maybe a little garlic.

16:33.959 --> 16:35.561
If you've never tried it, try it.

16:35.594 --> 16:37.796
Anyway, what happens is
I go back to China

16:37.828 --> 16:39.731
a couple of years ago
and I go to try to find

16:39.765 --> 16:41.000
my little noodle shop.

16:41.033 --> 16:42.802
My little dondonya shop, right?

16:42.834 --> 16:44.602
I mean, it was about
a five tables, little thing,

16:44.635 --> 16:46.038
over in the corner somewhere,

16:46.072 --> 16:47.673
and I'm walking All around Beijing.

16:47.706 --> 16:49.274
Can't find it, can't find it.

16:49.308 --> 16:51.144
FinAlly I turn a corner,
'cause as you know,

16:51.176 --> 16:52.845
China has changed a lot
in the past 20 years.

16:52.878 --> 16:55.914
Turn a corner and there's the spot.

16:55.947 --> 16:59.183
It's a huge glass building,
but here's the deal.

16:59.217 --> 17:01.187
This is not a joke.

17:01.219 --> 17:03.154
He's engaged in the story.
We have a driveway moment.

17:03.188 --> 17:04.891
Repeat, we have a driveway moment.

17:04.923 --> 17:06.625
Go for broth.

17:06.659 --> 17:08.694
It was empty, China is changing.

17:08.727 --> 17:10.095
Remember I said up at the top,

17:10.127 --> 17:12.631
44 billion individual portions
of noodles

17:12.663 --> 17:15.267
and that's even after
somebody has come in

17:15.300 --> 17:17.703
and knocked down
my Volkswagen dealership.

17:17.737 --> 17:20.172
So the conclusion to draw here, I think,

17:20.204 --> 17:23.275
if I can sum it up,
which I reAlly hope I can...

17:23.307 --> 17:25.144
"Asia-phile." Hey, everybody.

17:25.178 --> 17:28.614
We're going to have
a ramen eating lesson today.

17:28.647 --> 17:30.983
Um, it's a very specific kind of ramen.

17:31.016 --> 17:32.685
Tsukemenen ramen.

17:32.718 --> 17:36.355
It's the dipping kind of ramen.

17:36.388 --> 17:37.756
Hold on, hon.

17:37.788 --> 17:39.791
I just have to watch this video.

17:39.825 --> 17:44.296
We use the noodles,
dip into the broth and eat.

17:44.329 --> 17:47.766
These are standard chopsticks
that you can find

17:47.799 --> 17:50.269
- in markets across America.
- Come on!

17:50.302 --> 17:52.905
I was in, uh, I was in
Shanghai not too long ago,

17:52.939 --> 17:54.708
went to the Night Noodle Market,

17:54.740 --> 17:56.240
actuAlly in a corner of Shanghai,

17:56.275 --> 17:58.344
extraordinary experience,
here's what they did:

17:58.377 --> 18:00.380
took a little bAll of dough,
whapped it on the counter,

18:00.412 --> 18:01.948
and boom,
stretched it out into a noodle.

18:01.980 --> 18:03.147
Whapped it on the counter again,

18:03.181 --> 18:05.049
stretched it out into four noodles.

18:05.083 --> 18:07.886
Whapped it, eight noodles.
You whap it one more time, 16...

18:07.920 --> 18:09.722
No, wait, let... let's hear the end.

18:09.756 --> 18:11.690
- Oh, okay.
-64. 3 1/2 minutes later,

18:11.723 --> 18:13.359
bang, bowl of noodles.

18:13.392 --> 18:15.126
Now, here's the moral of the story:

18:15.160 --> 18:18.330
Noodles matter.
Noodles matter to people.

18:18.363 --> 18:20.032
They matter to local economies...

18:20.065 --> 18:21.333
And speaking of the economy,

18:21.365 --> 18:23.234
we are still doing our pledge drive.

18:23.268 --> 18:24.737
We're losing him.

18:24.769 --> 18:26.070
Driveway Moment, disengage.

18:26.104 --> 18:28.106
- No, no!
- No, no.

18:28.141 --> 18:30.209
I think they're going to take
an economic downturn here...

18:30.242 --> 18:32.045
I don't know, actuAlly, how much time

18:32.076 --> 18:34.212
we're going to have to stretch
out the pledge drive,

18:34.247 --> 18:37.383
so let's get back to
the Asian food market worldwide,

18:37.416 --> 18:39.852
which I'm sure people are interested in.

18:39.884 --> 18:41.753
I'm sorry, Peter.

18:41.787 --> 18:43.390
So essentiAlly, you want
to get a big bite of this.

18:43.422 --> 18:45.891
Dip it into your broth,

18:45.924 --> 18:50.296
and then slurp it down in one shot.

18:54.833 --> 18:56.402
- Wow.
- Wow.

19:04.042 --> 19:06.278
- Still not working.
- Oh, just let go.

19:06.311 --> 19:08.648
- It's not gonna work.
- Okay.

The way you worked with your citizens

19:35.974 --> 19:38.010
to neutralize this monstrosity

19:38.044 --> 19:40.313
and bring it to a peaceful conclusion

19:40.345 --> 19:42.146
was impressive.

19:42.180 --> 19:45.817
We've decided to offer you
a job in our headquarters

19:45.852 --> 19:46.885
