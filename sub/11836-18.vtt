WEBVTT

00:01.267 --> 00:02.602
DOLE: Previously
on The Practice...

00:02.636 --> 00:05.338
Why are you so angry?

00:05.371 --> 00:07.741
DOLE: For pretending that
my husband's in love with me

00:07.774 --> 00:08.875
when I know he's not.

00:08.909 --> 00:11.712
Lindsay, for God's sake.

00:11.745 --> 00:13.079
Of course I love you.

00:13.113 --> 00:14.948
DOLE: Bobby,
when I started my own firm,

00:14.981 --> 00:17.584
I think I was beginning
a process.

00:17.618 --> 00:18.919
Process?

00:18.952 --> 00:20.220
Of leaving you.

00:21.688 --> 00:22.989
Oh, gee.
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:23.023 --> 00:23.890
Bobby!

00:23.924 --> 00:25.058
Oh, my God. Sarah?

00:25.091 --> 00:26.226
How are you?

00:26.259 --> 00:27.060
DONNELL: I'm great.

00:27.093 --> 00:28.294
I thought you left Boston?

00:28.328 --> 00:29.295
Well, I'm back.

00:29.329 --> 00:30.731
Uh, DC summers
were too hot

00:30.764 --> 00:32.232
and I'm at Wickham now,
private practice.

00:32.265 --> 00:33.233
Wickham?
BARKER: Yes.

00:33.266 --> 00:34.000
Well, that's a good firm.

00:34.034 --> 00:35.301
BARKER: It is.

00:35.335 --> 00:36.803
Bobby, what's going on?

00:36.837 --> 00:38.338
Why are we having coffee?

00:38.371 --> 00:41.207
Well, like you said,
to catch up and...

00:41.241 --> 00:41.942
BARKER: Let's catch up then.

00:41.975 --> 00:43.243
How's your marriage?

00:45.812 --> 00:46.713
If you have
to think about it,

00:46.747 --> 00:48.014
maybe you shouldn't be
having coffee

00:48.048 --> 00:49.415
with a woman
you used to sleep with.

00:49.449 --> 00:51.652
I'm very faithful.

00:51.685 --> 00:52.919
Then maybe
you should make use

00:52.953 --> 00:55.656
of this free time
and spend it with your wife.

00:59.325 --> 01:01.267
(cellular phone rings)

01:04.404 --> 01:06.039
Yo.

01:06.072 --> 01:07.340
Zee.

01:07.373 --> 01:09.408
No, it's not like that.

01:09.442 --> 01:12.178
Look, I'm just saying things
are slow out here.

01:12.212 --> 01:13.013
It's not an excuse.

01:13.046 --> 01:14.247
I just...

01:14.280 --> 01:17.450
(sighs) Yeah, I hear you.

01:17.483 --> 01:19.620
No.

01:19.653 --> 01:21.922
Hey, you'll get your money,
all right?

01:39.740 --> 01:41.675
(gunshots)

02:12.646 --> 02:17.083
(music playing)

03:02.102 --> 03:05.305
REPORTER: But they believe
the shooting was drug-related.

03:05.338 --> 03:07.774
The suspect, only 19 years old,

03:07.808 --> 03:09.976
was arrested trying
to flee the scene.

03:10.010 --> 03:12.513
In fact, police say
the Dorchester teen

03:12.546 --> 03:14.748
was still holding
the murder weapon.

03:14.781 --> 03:16.850
Police have identified
the victim

03:16.883 --> 03:19.485
as 36-year-old Lauren Hayes.

03:19.520 --> 03:21.688
Hayes,
a single mother of three,

03:21.722 --> 03:24.825
was reportedly
walking her son to school.

03:24.858 --> 03:26.326
As for the--
When did we get appointed?

03:26.359 --> 03:27.528
The judge called
at 7:00.

03:27.561 --> 03:29.896
Eugene and Jimmy
left an hour ago.

03:29.930 --> 03:32.065
Helen Gamble drew the case.

03:32.933 --> 03:34.300
Great.

03:34.334 --> 03:35.936
REPORTER:
According to eyewitnesses,

03:35.969 --> 03:38.104
the suspect, Troy Ezekiel,

03:38.138 --> 03:41.441
just brandished the gun
and began firing.

03:42.075 --> 03:43.309
It was an accident.

03:43.343 --> 03:44.545
Slow down.

03:44.578 --> 03:45.712
EZEKIEL: You need
to find Willie Brand.

03:45.746 --> 03:46.479
He was the guy
I was shooting at.

03:46.513 --> 03:47.981
I never meant
to hit that lady.

03:48.014 --> 03:50.150
YOUNG: It really doesn't matter
who you were shooting at Troy,

03:50.183 --> 03:51.718
if you--
He was gonna kill me.

03:51.752 --> 03:52.786
That matters!

03:52.819 --> 03:54.054
It matters to me.

03:54.087 --> 03:56.056
Who was going to kill you?

03:56.089 --> 03:57.891
Willie Brand.

03:57.924 --> 03:59.726
He said if I sold
on his corner one more time,

03:59.760 --> 04:00.967
he was gonna cap me.

04:01.001 --> 04:02.769
Now, you need
to be chasing his ass down

04:02.803 --> 04:04.237
instead of sitting here.
I don't need to be chasing

04:04.270 --> 04:05.305
anybody's ass down.

04:05.338 --> 04:07.407
So, this was
a drug-territory thing?

04:07.440 --> 04:08.408
Yes.

04:08.441 --> 04:09.543
Oh, what?
Did he reach for a gun

04:09.576 --> 04:10.877
or point one at you?

04:10.911 --> 04:11.578
What did he do?

04:11.612 --> 04:12.478
Nothing.

04:12.513 --> 04:14.114
But I wasn't about to wait.

04:15.448 --> 04:16.082
He was gonna do it.

04:16.116 --> 04:16.950
I know.

04:19.786 --> 04:20.786
YOUNG: Okay.

04:22.623 --> 04:25.826
No talking in the courtroom.

04:25.859 --> 04:27.994
We'll meet here right
after the arraignment.

04:36.269 --> 04:40.240
32777 Commonwealth
vs. Troy Ezekiel

04:40.273 --> 04:42.175
on the charge of murder
in the first degree.

04:42.208 --> 04:43.376
Excuse me, Your Honor,

04:43.409 --> 04:45.111
but my client
hasn't been brought in yet.

04:46.913 --> 04:47.681
Where is he?

04:47.714 --> 04:48.882
DICKSON: I can answer that.

04:51.384 --> 04:53.754
I apologize for the late notice,
Your Honor.

04:53.787 --> 04:56.056
I'm Todd Dickson
from the Justice Department.

04:56.089 --> 04:58.158
Troy Ezekiel
is now in federal custody.

04:58.191 --> 04:58.892
What?

04:58.925 --> 04:59.760
Since when?

04:59.793 --> 05:00.601
A few minutes ago.

05:00.634 --> 05:02.135
U.S. Marshals
just took him.

05:02.168 --> 05:04.470
Again, I apologize
for the last-second confusion.

05:04.505 --> 05:06.740
Took him on whose authority?

05:06.773 --> 05:08.408
Judge Manella
of the United States

05:08.441 --> 05:09.610
District Court for Boston.

05:09.643 --> 05:11.377
She issued a writ
early this morning.

05:11.411 --> 05:12.779
Is there a new charge?

05:12.813 --> 05:15.481
Murder in the furtherance
of a drug enterprise.

05:15.516 --> 05:18.051
And drug trafficking within
a thousand feet of a school.

05:23.089 --> 05:24.190
Did you know about this?

05:24.224 --> 05:25.559
Of course
I didn't know.

05:25.592 --> 05:26.927
Did you see
my expression?

05:26.960 --> 05:29.329
There are murders all the time
in that neighborhood.

05:29.362 --> 05:31.264
The federal government
has never stepped in.

05:31.297 --> 05:32.498
Jimmy, figure it out.

05:32.533 --> 05:34.901
There can only be
one explanation.

05:35.368 --> 05:36.136
Which is?

05:36.169 --> 05:37.504
(sighs)

05:37.538 --> 05:39.339
What can
the federal government do

05:39.372 --> 05:41.107
that the state can't?

05:43.109 --> 05:44.444
Oh, God.

05:44.477 --> 05:45.546
What?

05:47.080 --> 05:48.148
They can execute.

05:51.117 --> 05:52.819
They're going
for the death penalty.

06:01.034 --> 06:02.769
The death penalty?

06:02.803 --> 06:04.004
Well, they haven't filed yet.

06:04.037 --> 06:05.672
But we think
that's what this is about.

06:05.706 --> 06:07.674
Hold on. They're gonna kill me
over an accident?

06:07.708 --> 06:08.775
YOUNG: Oh, you did
kill somebody.

06:08.809 --> 06:10.511
The fact that it was
the wrong person--

06:10.544 --> 06:11.845
Why the hell
aren't you on my side?

06:11.878 --> 06:13.947
Let's get something straight.

06:13.980 --> 06:16.116
I'm your lawyer,
not your friend.

06:16.149 --> 06:17.183
Now I remember you.

06:17.217 --> 06:20.186
You came to my school
on some career-day crap.

06:20.220 --> 06:21.988
You were cocky then,
and you still are.

06:22.022 --> 06:23.557
Pity I didn't know better.

06:23.590 --> 06:25.391
Look how we turned out.

06:25.425 --> 06:27.594
I should've been
more like you.

06:30.130 --> 06:31.832
You wanna see how tough you are
without a gun?

06:32.899 --> 06:33.834
Go ahead.

06:35.702 --> 06:37.170
Second thing
to get straight.

06:37.203 --> 06:38.839
You a punk.

06:38.872 --> 06:41.975
Drug dealer, murderer, punk,

06:42.008 --> 06:43.409
which makes my job tougher.

06:43.443 --> 06:45.646
But I'm gonna do my job
all the same.

06:45.679 --> 06:48.281
All I need for you
is to do yours,

06:48.314 --> 06:51.151
which basically means
to keep your mouth shut

06:51.184 --> 06:53.520
and do as I tell you.

06:53.554 --> 06:55.488
(music playing)

07:00.266 --> 07:02.135
They're really going
for death?

07:03.904 --> 07:04.838
Yes.

07:06.339 --> 07:07.107
They are.

07:13.046 --> 07:15.649
BARKER: What happens is
they form an Ad Hoc Committee.

07:15.682 --> 07:18.552
Basically, what they do
is they walk around the office,

07:18.585 --> 07:20.486
grab four
or five prosecutors,

07:20.521 --> 07:21.622
whoever's there.

07:21.655 --> 07:23.389
And that committee
decides whether or not

07:23.423 --> 07:24.424
to go for death?

07:24.457 --> 07:25.992
Pretty much.

07:26.026 --> 07:28.595
The U. S. Attorney
makes a short presentation,

07:28.629 --> 07:29.863
and then they vote.

07:29.896 --> 07:30.931
Simple as that.

07:30.964 --> 07:33.333
Sometimes they even do it
over sandwiches.

07:33.366 --> 07:35.536
The problem is once they decide,

07:35.569 --> 07:37.470
Bobby is right,
you can't appeal it.

07:37.504 --> 07:39.139
Do we get to address
this committee?

07:39.172 --> 07:40.974
Do you have the right to? No.

07:41.007 --> 07:43.476
But sometimes they will invite
defense lawyers in

07:43.510 --> 07:44.778
to hear what they have to say.

07:44.811 --> 07:46.680
How do we get
such an invitation?

07:46.713 --> 07:47.914
You cross your fingers.

07:47.948 --> 07:48.982
Thank you.

07:49.015 --> 07:50.383
Any other way?

07:50.416 --> 07:51.885
DONNELL: Like someone
who used to work

07:51.918 --> 07:53.319
in the justice department

07:53.353 --> 07:54.688
could make a phone call?

07:56.523 --> 07:58.725
Please.

07:58.759 --> 08:00.601
This kid is a criminal,
no doubt,

08:00.634 --> 08:02.335
but he doesn't deserve death.

08:04.905 --> 08:06.406
I'll make a call.

08:06.439 --> 08:08.909
Thank you.

08:08.942 --> 08:10.010
Could I have a second
with Bobby?

08:18.151 --> 08:19.586
What are you doing?

08:20.453 --> 08:21.454
What?

08:21.487 --> 08:22.623
Why am I here?

08:24.124 --> 08:25.559
Because we needed--
BARKER: You don't have

08:25.592 --> 08:28.161
any other connections
to the justice department?

08:29.896 --> 08:31.197
Believe it or not.

08:31.231 --> 08:32.164
No.

08:33.734 --> 08:34.500
Mmm.

08:35.836 --> 08:36.669
Hey.

08:36.703 --> 08:37.470
Hey.

08:37.504 --> 08:40.006
Um, Lindsay Dole, my wife.

08:40.874 --> 08:41.642
Sarah Barker.

08:41.674 --> 08:42.543
Hi.

08:42.576 --> 08:44.177
Nice to meet you.

08:44.210 --> 08:45.746
Do you want me
to wait or--

08:45.779 --> 08:47.013
DONNELL:
Um, no, no.

08:47.047 --> 08:47.748
I think--

08:47.781 --> 08:48.982
We're done.

08:49.015 --> 08:50.984
We're done. Yes.

08:51.017 --> 08:52.853
DONNELL:
Thank you again for--

08:53.486 --> 08:54.320
Everything I've done.

08:55.088 --> 08:55.822
Yes.

08:57.357 --> 08:59.993
Well, I will let you know
what the committee says.

09:00.026 --> 09:01.067
Nice to meet you, Lindsay.

09:01.101 --> 09:02.168
You too.

09:07.107 --> 09:08.341
You okay?

09:08.742 --> 09:10.110
Me?

09:10.143 --> 09:12.546
You seem a little on tilt.

09:12.579 --> 09:15.115
Oh, um, death-penalty case.

09:15.148 --> 09:17.217
I'm a little rattled.

09:17.250 --> 09:19.452
Ah.

09:19.485 --> 09:20.654
Too rattled to eat?

09:20.687 --> 09:21.522
No, no.

09:21.555 --> 09:23.389
Let's go eat.

09:33.199 --> 09:35.301
STRINGER: If you think about it,
these are exactly the criminals

09:35.335 --> 09:36.703
they should execute.

09:36.737 --> 09:37.904
How do you figure that?

09:37.938 --> 09:39.606
STRINGER: Well,
if the death penalty exists

09:39.640 --> 09:40.874
as a deterrent,

09:40.907 --> 09:42.776
this is where it would be
the most effective.

09:42.809 --> 09:44.010
You know, if people
get the message

09:44.044 --> 09:45.345
you get careless
with a gun--

09:45.378 --> 09:47.648
I think we should
just deport them.

09:47.681 --> 09:49.149
He's an American, Lucy.

09:49.182 --> 09:50.483
So what?

09:50.517 --> 09:52.452
You kill somebody,
you lose citizenship.

09:52.485 --> 09:53.654
Boom. Done.

09:53.687 --> 09:55.121
What's wrong with that?

09:56.422 --> 09:57.257
Hi.

09:57.290 --> 09:58.224
Hi.

09:58.258 --> 09:59.159
They're right in there.

09:59.192 --> 10:00.567
Thank you.

10:08.509 --> 10:10.243
Okay, you've got
your invitation.

10:10.276 --> 10:11.812
10:00 tomorrow morning.

10:11.845 --> 10:12.913
Thank you.

10:12.946 --> 10:15.616
BERLUTI: Is there
a certain procedure or--

10:15.649 --> 10:17.150
Not really.

10:17.183 --> 10:19.385
The prosecution goes first,
then you.

10:19.419 --> 10:21.454
Expect to get
about 10 minutes.

10:21.487 --> 10:24.725
Now, look, don't waste it
arguing the elements.

10:24.758 --> 10:26.392
The committee assumes guilt.

10:26.426 --> 10:28.028
They assume
a first-degree conviction.

10:28.061 --> 10:31.097
Their role is only
how to punish the convicted.

10:31.131 --> 10:33.466
You mean what punishment
to recommend.

10:33.499 --> 10:35.468
It's the jury who decides.

10:35.502 --> 10:36.637
The jury may decide, Jimmy,

10:36.670 --> 10:38.539
but if you look
at their track record,

10:38.572 --> 10:41.174
when the feds ask for death,
they almost always get it.

10:41.207 --> 10:43.710
YOUNG: Which means if we're
to save this kid's life--

10:43.744 --> 10:45.345
You need to do it here.

10:45.378 --> 10:47.581
DONNELL: What about
administrative rules?

10:47.614 --> 10:49.449
I don't think you understand.

10:49.482 --> 10:51.952
They pluck five prosecutors,
they put them in a room,

10:51.985 --> 10:52.686
and they decide.

10:52.719 --> 10:53.920
No rules,

10:53.954 --> 10:55.756
no evidentiary procedure,

10:55.789 --> 10:58.224
no due process.

10:58.258 --> 11:00.567
You just make
the best case you can

11:00.601 --> 11:03.637
that this kid deep down
is an angel.

11:04.738 --> 11:05.939
We better get to work.

11:06.740 --> 11:08.474
I'm still stuck on the why.

11:08.509 --> 11:10.711
Why go after this kid?

11:10.744 --> 11:11.545
BARKER: It isn't the kid, Jimmy.

11:11.578 --> 11:12.713
It's the Commonwealth.

11:13.780 --> 11:15.516
Ashcroft is trying
to bring the death penalty

11:15.549 --> 11:17.551
into all of the States
that don't have it,

11:17.584 --> 11:19.820
and Massachusetts
is on the top of his list.

11:19.853 --> 11:24.190
So he's hauling state
murder cases into federal court?

11:24.224 --> 11:26.960
YOUNG: Like I said,
we better get to work.

11:31.632 --> 11:32.332
Thank you.

11:32.365 --> 11:33.867
BARKER: No problem.

11:34.968 --> 11:35.636
DONNELL: Sarah,

11:37.538 --> 11:39.139
we really appreciate this.

11:39.172 --> 11:40.807
Well, good luck with it.

11:40.841 --> 11:42.075
You're gonna need it.

11:45.145 --> 11:46.479
Listen, uh,

11:48.849 --> 11:50.150
it's gonna be
a late night here,

11:50.183 --> 11:52.786
and I don't know
if you have plans, but...

11:56.156 --> 11:57.858
you wanna grab some dinner?

12:04.605 --> 12:06.807
The reason
this is so important.

12:08.341 --> 12:09.810
We have no defense.

12:10.911 --> 12:12.713
The kid he was shooting at

12:12.746 --> 12:14.815
it turns out
he had no weapon.

12:14.848 --> 12:17.250
None of the witnesses saw him
make any threatening gestures

12:17.283 --> 12:19.185
towards your son,

12:19.219 --> 12:21.354
and Troy himself
told the police

12:21.387 --> 12:24.558
that he didn't see him
reach for a gun.

12:24.591 --> 12:27.561
So he's going to be convicted?

12:29.195 --> 12:32.633
I'd be lying
if I said I thought otherwise,

12:32.666 --> 12:35.468
which means
we need to convince them

12:35.502 --> 12:37.638
not to go
for the death penalty.

12:37.671 --> 12:41.642
A, because their decision
isn't subject to appeal,

12:41.675 --> 12:45.579
and B, when they go
for the death penalty,

12:45.612 --> 12:48.014
they usually get it.

12:48.048 --> 12:50.917
My God.

12:50.951 --> 12:52.519
My God.

12:52.553 --> 12:54.755
YOUNG: Look, I'm not even sure

12:54.788 --> 12:57.558
the committee will agree
to hear from you.

12:57.591 --> 12:59.392
But if they do--

13:01.134 --> 13:04.671
I did the best I could.

13:04.705 --> 13:07.273
Troy's older brother,

13:07.307 --> 13:08.675
he got into drugs.

13:09.776 --> 13:12.112
Troy just followed suit,
I guess.

13:13.514 --> 13:14.815
But I tried.

13:17.551 --> 13:18.919
I tried.

13:20.554 --> 13:23.489
(music playing)

13:25.859 --> 13:29.362
DONNELL: So, now we're
in therapy and--

13:29.395 --> 13:31.264
I don't know.
I hope it helps, but...

13:37.437 --> 13:38.404
hello?

13:39.506 --> 13:40.707
I'm here.

13:41.407 --> 13:43.977
Well, maybe
you can say something.

13:46.547 --> 13:48.949
Okay. I can't believe
we're sitting here,

13:48.982 --> 13:50.183
doing this.

13:50.216 --> 13:50.884
How's that?

13:51.952 --> 13:52.886
Doing what?

13:52.919 --> 13:54.287
We're having dinner.

13:55.589 --> 13:56.823
Oh, we're having dinner.

13:56.857 --> 13:58.491
Okay.

13:58.525 --> 14:02.135
What do you think
we're doing?

14:02.168 --> 14:03.970
Bobby, this is foreplay.

14:04.571 --> 14:05.539
Excuse me?

14:05.572 --> 14:06.406
BARKER: Well, we did 10 minutes

14:06.439 --> 14:07.508
on my lousy marriage,

14:07.541 --> 14:08.875
20 minutes
on how your wife

14:08.909 --> 14:10.376
really doesn't
understand you.

14:13.279 --> 14:17.450
This is foreplay
for infidelity.

14:17.483 --> 14:19.252
It isn't even original.

14:19.285 --> 14:21.922
I have no plans
for being unfaithful to my--

14:21.955 --> 14:23.690
BARKER: Yes, you do.

14:23.724 --> 14:25.659
You're probably too good
of a guy to actually do it,

14:25.692 --> 14:27.694
but just allowing
for the possibility.

14:27.728 --> 14:28.695
You're wrong.

14:33.534 --> 14:36.937
I'm having dinner
with an old friend,

14:36.970 --> 14:38.204
period.

14:39.472 --> 14:40.774
Fine.

14:40.807 --> 14:41.942
DONNELL: You know,
you make it seem like

14:41.975 --> 14:44.410
I'm trying to orchestrate
something here,

14:44.444 --> 14:45.445
but here you sit.

14:45.478 --> 14:46.713
BARKER: You brought me out
on a case.

14:46.747 --> 14:49.616
DONNELL: Which doesn't obligate
you to dinner,

14:49.650 --> 14:52.085
but here you sit.

14:53.186 --> 14:54.755
Okay, you're right.

14:54.788 --> 14:55.789
I plead guilty.

14:57.123 --> 14:58.992
So, you're up, Bobby.
I made my admission.

14:59.025 --> 15:01.101
I'm here because I find it
a little exciting

15:01.134 --> 15:04.070
to be having dinner with a man
I used to make love to.

15:04.104 --> 15:05.005
I'm not innocent.

15:05.038 --> 15:05.972
What's your story?

15:07.808 --> 15:09.843
I'll tell you your story.

15:09.876 --> 15:11.177
You feel lonely.

15:11.211 --> 15:13.914
You feel Lindsay's responsible
for that loneliness,

15:13.947 --> 15:15.816
and so that somehow justifies

15:15.849 --> 15:18.552
you going out to enjoy
some simple company

15:18.585 --> 15:19.319
with a friend.

15:20.420 --> 15:21.421
Lindsay shut you out.

15:21.454 --> 15:23.123
She drove you
to this dinner in a way.

15:23.156 --> 15:25.659
Isn't that the way it goes?

15:25.692 --> 15:27.493
Of course, you'd never let it go
anywhere with me,

15:27.528 --> 15:28.729
because you're faithful.

15:28.762 --> 15:29.863
It's a friendship,

15:29.896 --> 15:32.298
completely innocent.

15:32.332 --> 15:34.300
If anything were
to happen, well,

15:34.334 --> 15:35.902
it would have to be me.

15:35.936 --> 15:38.471
Always was a bit
of a risk-taker, that crazy me.

15:44.778 --> 15:46.513
You're safe, Bobby.

15:46.547 --> 15:47.714
I'm not sure
it's what you want,

15:47.748 --> 15:50.250
but you're safe.

15:50.283 --> 15:53.153
This will be a dinner,
nothing more.

16:04.304 --> 16:05.839
Once you get the names
of the committee members,

16:05.872 --> 16:07.140
call me.
I'll give you the rundown.

16:07.173 --> 16:08.174
Okay.

16:09.109 --> 16:10.877
This is me right here, 207.

16:19.352 --> 16:21.187
(sighs)

16:21.221 --> 16:22.455
Again,

16:23.323 --> 16:24.891
thanks for all your help.

16:24.925 --> 16:27.227
My pleasure
and thank you for dinner.

16:30.931 --> 16:32.733
If you're ever single again,
call me.

16:34.735 --> 16:36.837
I don't have plans
to be single again.

16:41.508 --> 16:43.143
Good night, Bobby.

16:50.917 --> 16:51.752
Night.

16:53.654 --> 16:56.723
(car door opens)

16:56.757 --> 16:58.625
(car door closes)

16:58.659 --> 17:01.234
(music playing)

17:13.413 --> 17:14.446
Did you kiss her back?

17:14.480 --> 17:15.582
No!

17:15.616 --> 17:17.349
And she didn't really kiss me.

17:17.383 --> 17:18.451
It was just
a good-night--

17:18.483 --> 17:20.353
Why were you having dinner
with her?

17:20.386 --> 17:21.954
I don't know.

17:21.988 --> 17:23.690
You all say I crave isolation.

17:23.723 --> 17:25.391
I think a part
of me needed--

17:25.425 --> 17:26.627
WASHINGTON: Don't give me
that crap!

17:26.660 --> 17:27.894
You're just looking
to pop your hot dog.

17:27.928 --> 17:28.662
Rebecca.

17:28.695 --> 17:31.497
"I'm lonely,
I'm misunderstood? "

17:31.532 --> 17:32.999
Why are you even
telling me this?

17:33.033 --> 17:34.234
I'll tell you why.

17:34.267 --> 17:35.636
You're looking to clear
your little conscience

17:35.669 --> 17:37.538
and not get caught.

17:37.571 --> 17:39.806
You should be telling Lindsay
if you're angry, not me,

17:39.840 --> 17:41.474
and certainly
not that slut Sarah.

17:41.508 --> 17:43.309
Everything's just black
and white with you, isn't it?

17:43.343 --> 17:44.545
This is.

17:44.578 --> 17:47.047
You don't go having dinner
with ex-girlfriends.

17:47.080 --> 17:48.248
You're married.

17:51.618 --> 17:54.154
(projector clicks)

17:54.187 --> 17:55.589
DICKSON:
This is how Troy Ezekiel

17:55.622 --> 17:56.923
looked that morning.

17:56.957 --> 17:59.425
This is the man
who killed Lauren Hayes,

17:59.459 --> 18:01.635
not the cleaned-up version
they brought in here today.

18:05.371 --> 18:07.107
What you're getting now

18:07.140 --> 18:09.910
is a copy
of Mr. Ezekiel's rap sheet.

18:11.244 --> 18:13.647
It shows two convictions
for cocaine possession.

18:13.680 --> 18:15.115
Those were misdemeanor arrests?

18:15.148 --> 18:17.283
The first one, that's correct.

18:17.317 --> 18:18.919
And as you can see,

18:18.952 --> 18:20.220
he was given a break.

18:20.253 --> 18:22.723
Instead of jail,
the court ordered treatment.

18:22.756 --> 18:25.759
Eighteen months later,
he was arrested again.

18:25.792 --> 18:27.894
This time with twice
the amount of drugs.

18:27.928 --> 18:30.296
And again, he was allowed
to plead to a misdemeanor.

18:30.330 --> 18:31.632
How long did he serve?

18:31.665 --> 18:33.900
Ninety days,
which was light

18:33.934 --> 18:36.737
given that he was already
a seller.

18:36.770 --> 18:38.204
Mr. Dickson,
let's get to the crime, please.

18:41.074 --> 18:44.778
DICKSON: This map shows
the path taken by the defendant.

18:44.811 --> 18:48.381
As you can see,
he started firing at will here.

18:48.414 --> 18:49.916
His intended target,

18:49.950 --> 18:51.417
a rival dealer,

18:51.451 --> 18:54.354
managed to get away
without being hit,

18:54.387 --> 18:57.290
but not before the defendant
emptied his clip,

18:57.323 --> 19:00.100
shooting 11 rounds
onto a crowded street

19:00.133 --> 19:03.069
less than two blocks away
from a school.

19:03.103 --> 19:05.872
He didn't care
who or what he hit.

19:08.875 --> 19:11.512
She was 36 years old.

19:11.545 --> 19:15.315
She had three children
she supported alone.

19:15.348 --> 19:17.050
She was a good woman,

19:17.083 --> 19:19.285
a good mother,

19:19.319 --> 19:22.422
gone now and forever.

19:24.925 --> 19:26.793
Lauren Hayes
didn't deserve to die.

19:28.762 --> 19:30.230
Troy Ezekiel does.

19:45.979 --> 19:48.549
This is Lauren Hayes' son.

19:48.582 --> 19:49.683
I'd like you
to hear from him.

20:00.266 --> 20:01.602
Did it go that well?

20:01.635 --> 20:03.336
They heard from the son.

20:03.369 --> 20:04.505
The son?

20:04.538 --> 20:05.438
Of the victim.

20:06.106 --> 20:07.574
It was pretty
devastating.

20:07.608 --> 20:10.010
YOUNG: Bobby, Sarah Barker,

20:10.043 --> 20:11.845
could you persuade her
to join our defense?

20:13.413 --> 20:14.548
What?
Why?

20:14.581 --> 20:17.017
YOUNG: Well, one problem
we have,

20:17.050 --> 20:18.752
Dickson knows
all the committee members.

20:18.785 --> 20:20.053
They're colleagues.

20:20.086 --> 20:22.055
Jimmy and I are just
your basic defense attorneys.

20:22.088 --> 20:24.324
We have no real credibility
with them.

20:24.357 --> 20:26.560
We thought since Sarah
used to work in that office--

20:26.593 --> 20:28.161
DONNELL:
That was many years ago.

20:28.194 --> 20:29.162
YOUNG: Even so,

20:29.195 --> 20:30.196
it couldn't hurt.

20:30.230 --> 20:32.666
And right now,
things don't look good.

20:32.699 --> 20:34.034
Could you ask her?

20:34.067 --> 20:35.168
WASHINGTON: I don't think
that's a good idea.

20:35.201 --> 20:36.369
No, I don't. Uh-uh.

20:36.402 --> 20:37.604
YOUNG: Well, I do.

20:37.638 --> 20:40.173
Bobby, we need some help here.

20:40.206 --> 20:42.408
I mean, if she could just
so much as be at our table.

20:48.281 --> 20:49.115
You're joking.

20:49.149 --> 20:50.350
DONNELL: It wasn't my idea.

20:50.383 --> 20:52.152
I promise you it wasn't.

20:52.185 --> 20:54.287
Well, exactly
what do they want me to do?

20:54.320 --> 20:56.089
Just join them.

20:56.122 --> 20:58.559
Be in the room with them.

20:58.592 --> 20:59.960
This wouldn't be you
inventing a way

20:59.993 --> 21:01.702
to be in a room with me?

21:01.735 --> 21:03.837
I give you my word.

21:03.870 --> 21:05.005
No.

21:05.038 --> 21:06.372
This comes from Eugene.

21:09.676 --> 21:13.514
You know a lot of these
committee members.

21:13.547 --> 21:15.081
It might help.

21:19.119 --> 21:20.954
We don't want to hear
from his father.

21:20.987 --> 21:22.589
Why not?

21:22.623 --> 21:25.058
Mr. Young, this committee
is already indulging you

21:25.091 --> 21:26.727
just by allowing you
to be here.

21:26.760 --> 21:28.428
You heard
from the victim's son.

21:28.461 --> 21:30.030
Why can't--
McNALLY: Look,

21:30.063 --> 21:32.533
if you wanna give Troy
a chance to speak, fine,

21:32.566 --> 21:33.934
but we're not going to turn this
into a hearing.

21:33.967 --> 21:35.836
We're just asking
for two minutes.

21:35.869 --> 21:38.038
The time for his father
to talk would be at sentencing.

21:38.071 --> 21:41.107
We're just asking for--
The answer is no, Counsel.

21:44.144 --> 21:45.912
You said you'd be willing
to hear from Troy?

21:46.379 --> 21:47.380
Briefly.

21:47.413 --> 21:49.550
Let us do that then.
Hold on.

21:49.583 --> 21:51.351
Give us a short break
to talk it over.

21:51.384 --> 21:52.619
I don't need to talk that over.

21:52.653 --> 21:53.520
Eugene.

21:55.789 --> 21:56.857
A short break.

22:00.093 --> 22:01.768
It's insane
to let him talk.

22:01.802 --> 22:03.136
We'd be offering up
free discovery.

22:03.169 --> 22:05.038
That's why they're willing
to hear from him.

22:05.071 --> 22:06.673
We might as well gift wrap

22:06.707 --> 22:07.608
the conviction.

22:07.641 --> 22:08.709
Eugene...

22:08.742 --> 22:10.143
you need to work on your tone.

22:12.178 --> 22:13.780
Now, normally,
I would agree.

22:13.814 --> 22:14.981
But here,

22:15.015 --> 22:17.017
the conviction is a done deal.

22:17.050 --> 22:19.419
He opened fire
on a crowded street

22:19.452 --> 22:20.353
in front of witnesses.

22:20.386 --> 22:21.655
The victim couldn't possibly

22:21.688 --> 22:22.623
be more sympathetic,

22:22.656 --> 22:23.690
and his own statement

22:23.724 --> 22:24.925
to the police supplies

22:24.958 --> 22:26.527
motive and intent.

22:28.494 --> 22:31.364
There's nothing to lose here

22:31.397 --> 22:33.166
and his life to gain.

22:35.969 --> 22:36.970
This is the problem
when you bring me in

22:37.003 --> 22:38.004
on things, guys.

22:38.038 --> 22:39.139
I have opinions.

22:42.208 --> 22:43.243
(knocks on door)

22:45.078 --> 22:45.846
Lindsay, hey.

22:45.879 --> 22:47.514
Hey. What's up?

22:47.548 --> 22:48.549
Nothing.

22:48.582 --> 22:50.416
I just thought I'd, uh...

22:52.853 --> 22:53.987
say hi.

22:55.255 --> 22:56.256
Oh.

22:57.858 --> 22:59.159
Hi.

22:59.192 --> 23:01.167
It's, you know,
since we don't work

23:01.201 --> 23:02.569
side by side anymore,

23:02.603 --> 23:03.403
I thought that could be

23:03.436 --> 23:05.271
one of the reasons that...

23:07.541 --> 23:09.776
I just thought it'd be good

23:09.810 --> 23:10.944
to check in with each other

23:10.977 --> 23:12.145
during the day.

23:12.913 --> 23:14.014
Oh.

23:14.781 --> 23:16.016
Good idea.

23:18.752 --> 23:19.620
(sighs)

23:19.653 --> 23:20.954
You know,

23:20.987 --> 23:22.623
I try to come in and connect,

23:22.656 --> 23:25.559
and you give back
nothing, Lindsay.

23:25.592 --> 23:27.561
Can we talk about this
at home?

23:27.594 --> 23:29.295
But we don't talk at home.

23:29.329 --> 23:32.165
By the time we get Bobby
to bed and--

23:32.198 --> 23:33.433
(sighs)

23:37.337 --> 23:38.371
(door slams)

23:41.374 --> 23:42.509
Dealing is the first thing

23:42.543 --> 23:44.611
I was ever good at.

23:44.645 --> 23:46.279
I never used.

23:46.312 --> 23:48.181
I never skimmed
from the bosses.

23:49.482 --> 23:51.451
I made more money
than any other corner.

23:53.253 --> 23:53.987
I was so good at it

23:54.020 --> 23:56.056
I started having problems.

23:56.089 --> 23:57.190
What kind of problems?

23:58.291 --> 23:59.693
Competition problems.

24:00.701 --> 24:01.902
Some of the other dealers
got word

24:01.935 --> 24:03.069
that I was making
big numbers,

24:03.103 --> 24:04.738
so they started coming around

24:04.771 --> 24:06.172
giving me trouble.

24:06.206 --> 24:08.041
So you thought your life
was in danger?

24:08.074 --> 24:10.176
No. I knew it was.

24:10.210 --> 24:10.911
I know these people.

24:10.944 --> 24:13.079
They don't play around.

24:13.113 --> 24:13.914
So I called a friend,

24:13.947 --> 24:15.549
and he fixed me up with a 9.

24:18.318 --> 24:19.553
The next day I saw Willie.

24:21.688 --> 24:22.989
I swear,

24:23.023 --> 24:25.659
I never meant to kill
that lady.

24:25.692 --> 24:26.527
When I saw what happened,

24:26.560 --> 24:28.028
I couldn't even breathe.

24:31.297 --> 24:32.533
I'm sorry.

24:35.468 --> 24:37.370
I don't know
what else to say.

24:51.985 --> 24:52.753
McNALLY: You've been
a drug dealer

24:52.786 --> 24:54.087
for the last four years?

24:55.355 --> 24:56.222
Yes.

24:56.256 --> 24:57.090
You've been arrested

24:57.123 --> 24:58.592
more than a dozen times.

24:58.625 --> 24:59.593
Well, the fact
that he was arrested

24:59.626 --> 25:01.134
doesn't prove
he did anything.

25:01.167 --> 25:01.968
It proves your client's

25:02.002 --> 25:03.770
a career criminal, Mr. Young.

25:03.804 --> 25:04.671
He started at possession,

25:04.705 --> 25:05.772
then escalated to sale,

25:05.806 --> 25:07.608
and now he's graduated
to murder.

25:07.641 --> 25:08.842
That was an accident.
McNALLY: Yes.

25:08.875 --> 25:09.743
You killed the wrong person.

25:09.776 --> 25:10.777
I understand.

25:10.811 --> 25:12.579
You were trying to kill
somebody else.

25:12.613 --> 25:13.647
No, I already told you that

25:13.680 --> 25:14.848
I didn't have a choice.

25:14.881 --> 25:16.482
It seems to me you had a choice

25:16.517 --> 25:18.585
to walk away from that corner.

25:18.619 --> 25:20.654
If you were worried
about your safety,

25:20.687 --> 25:22.322
why didn't you quit?

25:30.263 --> 25:31.698
I don't know.

25:33.333 --> 25:34.334
Look...

25:36.703 --> 25:37.838
Mr. Young told me

25:37.871 --> 25:39.940
I need to be honest,

25:39.973 --> 25:41.241
and I'm doing that.

25:42.743 --> 25:44.277
I'm guilty.

25:46.913 --> 25:48.014
I killed that woman,

25:48.048 --> 25:49.650
and it was wrong.

25:53.119 --> 25:54.320
I know I got no excuses.

25:54.354 --> 25:55.689
I chose my life.

25:57.924 --> 25:58.725
But I don't think

25:58.759 --> 25:59.760
that it's unfair to say

25:59.793 --> 26:02.368
that I didn't get a lot
of breaks

26:02.402 --> 26:03.469
in my life.

26:05.639 --> 26:07.373
It was hard growing up.

26:08.842 --> 26:10.476
It was hard ever since.

26:11.111 --> 26:13.279
I'm 19 years old.

26:16.149 --> 26:18.819
I know that I made a lot
of mistakes.

26:19.720 --> 26:20.887
And I know I got to pay

26:20.921 --> 26:22.488
for what I did,

26:23.524 --> 26:24.457
but I just don't think

26:24.490 --> 26:25.892
I should have to die for it.

26:29.029 --> 26:30.163
Yeah, maybe I got no right

26:30.196 --> 26:31.264
to say that.

26:33.900 --> 26:35.636
I'm just asking you...

26:36.803 --> 26:38.171
I'm just asking you to...

26:38.905 --> 26:39.706
I'm just asking you

26:39.740 --> 26:40.941
to give me a chance.

26:42.275 --> 26:45.211
(music playing)

27:04.505 --> 27:05.238
Lindsay.

27:05.271 --> 27:06.472
Hey. What's Bobby up to?

27:07.273 --> 27:08.241
Why are you asking me?

27:08.274 --> 27:10.043
I, I, I mean,

27:10.076 --> 27:11.411
what makes you think

27:11.444 --> 27:12.312
he's even up to something?

27:12.345 --> 27:13.514
I mean, I, I haven't
noticed him

27:13.547 --> 27:14.781
being up to something.

27:14.815 --> 27:15.982
Anybody here think

27:16.016 --> 27:17.017
Bobby's up to something?

27:18.351 --> 27:20.020
See? Nobody.

27:21.254 --> 27:22.422
Is he here?

27:22.455 --> 27:23.857
He's in his office,
but I don't think

27:23.890 --> 27:24.691
he's up to anything.

27:39.272 --> 27:40.340
Listen.

27:42.442 --> 27:44.144
I know you're trying
to make an effort.

27:45.712 --> 27:46.713
And, um...

27:48.815 --> 27:50.416
it's been months,
you know, and--

27:50.450 --> 27:51.384
Lindsay.

27:53.286 --> 27:54.721
You're not in love with me.

27:56.022 --> 27:57.157
You can say it.

27:59.425 --> 28:01.334
I love you, Bobby.

28:04.470 --> 28:07.040
But, I don't know.

28:07.073 --> 28:08.474
It's just--it seems with,

28:09.543 --> 28:11.111
with everything
that I've been through,

28:11.144 --> 28:13.246
I, I guess I feel..

28:14.981 --> 28:16.650
a little emotionally depleted.

28:16.683 --> 28:18.685
And what little I have

28:18.719 --> 28:20.286
I give to our son,

28:20.320 --> 28:21.321
and...

28:22.756 --> 28:23.757
it seems...

28:25.091 --> 28:26.392
I have nothing left.

28:30.396 --> 28:32.666
You said that in starting
your own firm.

28:35.802 --> 28:37.871
you were beginning a process

28:40.006 --> 28:41.174
of leaving me.

28:44.878 --> 28:46.747
Where are you in that process?

28:50.917 --> 28:52.252
I want us to make it.

28:54.320 --> 28:56.456
I so desperately
want us to make it.

28:57.090 --> 29:00.026
(music playing)

29:06.339 --> 29:07.140
DICKSON: Personally,

29:07.173 --> 29:08.942
I'm tired of the smug morality

29:08.975 --> 29:11.211
of death-penalty opponents.

29:11.244 --> 29:13.914
It's easy to be for life.

29:13.947 --> 29:15.481
What's tough is to stand

29:15.516 --> 29:17.183
for what's right.

29:17.217 --> 29:19.052
What's hard is to do

29:19.085 --> 29:20.687
the dirty work
of dealing with those

29:20.721 --> 29:21.555
who have no regard

29:21.588 --> 29:23.456
for the lives of others.

29:23.489 --> 29:25.959
We blame poverty
for their crimes,

29:25.992 --> 29:27.027
the fact that their parents

29:27.060 --> 29:28.128
didn't love them enough,

29:28.161 --> 29:28.862
the media.

29:28.895 --> 29:31.297
We even blame ourselves.

29:31.331 --> 29:33.299
We've become so weak

29:33.333 --> 29:35.769
and morally uncertain

29:35.802 --> 29:37.337
that we can't even
come together

29:37.370 --> 29:40.206
to punish those who kill us.

29:41.808 --> 29:42.876
Today,

29:42.909 --> 29:44.978
I stand
for the silent dead.

29:46.179 --> 29:48.815
Lauren Hayes can't speak
for herself,

29:48.849 --> 29:50.717
but her blood cries out.

29:50.751 --> 29:53.887
Do justice to Troy Ezekiel.

29:53.920 --> 29:55.656
He took her life,

29:55.689 --> 29:57.223
her future,

29:57.257 --> 29:59.192
all that she was
or will ever be,

29:59.225 --> 30:00.967
and he took even more than that.

30:02.202 --> 30:04.170
He took her sons' futures.

30:05.138 --> 30:05.939
He sentenced them

30:05.972 --> 30:07.508
to a life of foster homes,

30:07.541 --> 30:08.875
and uncertainty,

30:08.909 --> 30:10.343
and pain.

30:11.277 --> 30:13.046
Make no mistake,

30:13.079 --> 30:14.247
there was more than
one victim there.

30:14.280 --> 30:16.416
Those boys are victims, too.

30:18.184 --> 30:20.486
Like me, you men
are prosecutors.

30:21.555 --> 30:23.690
Our duty is to protect
society.

30:25.058 --> 30:26.960
Executing Troy Ezekiel

30:26.993 --> 30:29.530
will affirm that we as a people

30:29.563 --> 30:31.064
are prepared to bear

30:31.097 --> 30:32.833
any ethical burden

30:32.866 --> 30:34.935
and bear any moral cost

30:34.968 --> 30:36.269
to defend our citizens

30:36.302 --> 30:37.871
and our way of life.

30:39.039 --> 30:40.406
God help us.

30:41.975 --> 30:42.909
If we're not strong enough

30:42.943 --> 30:44.711
to do that anymore.

30:53.620 --> 30:54.755
Up until now you've heard

30:54.788 --> 30:57.724
mainly from Eugene Young.

30:57.758 --> 30:59.993
I'd like you to hear
from me now.

31:00.867 --> 31:02.002
Personally,

31:02.035 --> 31:04.738
I've always been
pro-death penalty.

31:04.771 --> 31:06.439
In the last few years,

31:06.472 --> 31:07.974
I've switched.

31:08.008 --> 31:11.244
Mainly on grounds
of humanity,

31:11.277 --> 31:14.380
but also on grounds

31:14.414 --> 31:16.116
the reality that the system

31:16.149 --> 31:19.352
is so fundamentally flawed.

31:19.385 --> 31:21.254
More than a hundred
death-row inmates

31:21.287 --> 31:23.924
have been cleared
and released.

31:23.957 --> 31:25.759
Who knows how many
innocent people

31:25.792 --> 31:26.660
we've killed.

31:26.693 --> 31:28.261
Mr. Berluti,

31:28.294 --> 31:29.195
for the sake of this hearing

31:29.229 --> 31:30.697
we assume guilt.

31:30.731 --> 31:32.933
And even if we didn't,

31:32.966 --> 31:34.234
are you really
suggesting to us

31:34.267 --> 31:36.002
that Troy Ezekiel
is innocent?

31:36.036 --> 31:37.037
I'm suggesting to you

31:37.070 --> 31:39.405
that the system
of capital punishment

31:39.439 --> 31:40.841
is broken.

31:40.874 --> 31:42.308
How people get on death row

31:42.342 --> 31:43.844
is suspect,

31:43.877 --> 31:45.512
and it's suspect here.

31:45.546 --> 31:47.480
How so?

31:47.514 --> 31:50.283
This is politics.

31:50.316 --> 31:52.452
The fact is
if we had a Democrat

31:52.485 --> 31:53.554
in the white house,

31:53.587 --> 31:55.589
none of us
would be here today,

31:55.622 --> 31:57.457
not on these facts,

31:57.490 --> 31:58.592
especially in a state

31:58.625 --> 32:01.702
that doesn't have
the death penalty.

32:01.735 --> 32:04.370
But now everything
is different.

32:04.404 --> 32:06.339
Under this administration,

32:06.372 --> 32:08.341
we do it all the time.

32:08.374 --> 32:09.943
We've sought more executions

32:09.976 --> 32:11.978
in the last six months

32:12.012 --> 32:13.046
than Bill Clinton did

32:13.079 --> 32:15.949
in the last eight years.

32:15.982 --> 32:18.418
What kind of system allows
that to happen,

32:18.451 --> 32:19.820
where the same crime,

32:19.853 --> 32:21.454
the same criminal

32:21.487 --> 32:23.289
is treated differently

32:23.323 --> 32:25.526
based on who's in office?

32:25.559 --> 32:27.427
One gets to live,

32:27.460 --> 32:29.596
one gets to die.

32:29.630 --> 32:30.664
I'd advise you to excise

32:30.697 --> 32:32.365
the political
commentary, Counsel,

32:32.398 --> 32:34.434
and just stick to Troy Ezekiel.

32:35.769 --> 32:36.737
The death penalty

32:36.770 --> 32:39.840
is the greatest
punishment we have.

32:39.873 --> 32:41.508
It's reserved for the most

32:41.542 --> 32:43.409
vicious criminals.

32:43.443 --> 32:44.745
It's the remedy we use

32:44.778 --> 32:47.814
for the worst of the worst.

32:47.848 --> 32:51.384
That's not Troy Ezekiel,

32:51.417 --> 32:53.554
and you know it.

32:53.587 --> 32:55.556
He needs to be punished.

32:55.589 --> 32:56.957
He's ready for that.

32:56.990 --> 32:59.192
That's why we came here today.

32:59.225 --> 33:00.366
That's why Troy answered

33:00.400 --> 33:01.535
all your questions

33:01.568 --> 33:02.636
and in the process,

33:02.669 --> 33:05.305
guaranteed himself a conviction.

33:05.338 --> 33:07.674
He knows his life

33:07.708 --> 33:09.375
is in your hands.

33:11.612 --> 33:14.648
The decision the five
of you make today

33:14.681 --> 33:16.583
is about much more

33:16.617 --> 33:19.720
than the fate of my client.

33:19.753 --> 33:21.121
It's about the character

33:21.154 --> 33:23.289
of this committee.

33:23.323 --> 33:25.258
It's about the integrity

33:25.291 --> 33:27.193
of this system.

33:31.297 --> 33:32.398
He's a boy.

33:33.934 --> 33:36.269
You can't seek to kill him

33:36.302 --> 33:38.171
and tell me politics

33:38.204 --> 33:39.773
isn't in play.

33:39.806 --> 33:42.743
(music playing)

34:00.801 --> 34:01.535
How long you think

34:01.568 --> 34:03.670
before we hear something?

34:03.704 --> 34:04.871
I don't know.

34:04.905 --> 34:06.607
Jimmy's checking.

34:06.640 --> 34:08.373
We're hoping
for an answer today.

34:12.245 --> 34:13.413
Thank you.

34:15.882 --> 34:17.350
I know you don't
like me much,

34:17.382 --> 34:18.784
but...

34:21.987 --> 34:24.157
I just want to say
thank you for...

34:29.161 --> 34:30.764
you like being a lawyer?

34:32.998 --> 34:35.068
For the most part.

34:35.101 --> 34:36.202
You seem good at it.

34:37.237 --> 34:38.271
Thank you.

34:40.574 --> 34:41.842
How long does it take?

34:42.909 --> 34:43.810
Sorry?

34:44.344 --> 34:45.445
Law school.

34:45.478 --> 34:46.446
Four years of college,

34:46.478 --> 34:48.915
but how many years
for law school?

34:49.783 --> 34:51.083
Three.

34:52.518 --> 34:53.520
Seven years.

34:56.289 --> 34:57.658
I've been thinking
of doing it.

35:00.601 --> 35:03.637
I think I wanna be
a public defender.

35:03.670 --> 35:04.505
You ever do that?

35:07.173 --> 35:08.875
No.
That's what I think

35:08.909 --> 35:10.310
I wanna do, help people.

35:12.779 --> 35:14.347
That's what I'mma do.

35:18.952 --> 35:19.920
(door opens)

35:21.522 --> 35:23.223
They called us back.

35:39.773 --> 35:41.508
The defendant's youth,

35:41.542 --> 35:42.442
his relatively short

35:42.475 --> 35:43.944
criminal history,

35:43.977 --> 35:45.979
and his family circumstances

35:46.012 --> 35:47.147
are mitigating factors

35:47.180 --> 35:48.348
that certainly support us

35:48.381 --> 35:49.850
pursuing a lesser sentence

35:49.883 --> 35:52.018
than death.

35:52.052 --> 35:53.253
However,

35:53.286 --> 35:55.455
the reckless nature
of the crime,

35:55.488 --> 35:57.891
the fact it furthered
drug trafficking,

35:57.924 --> 36:00.433
its commission
so close to a school,

36:00.466 --> 36:01.802
the enormous impact it had

36:01.835 --> 36:03.637
on the victim's family.

36:03.670 --> 36:05.939
These aggravating facts
also support us

36:05.972 --> 36:06.773
filing death papers

36:06.807 --> 36:08.041
and seeking to execute him.

36:10.577 --> 36:13.446
Based on today's presentation,

36:13.479 --> 36:15.516
the committee has voted
in this case

36:16.683 --> 36:17.551
to seek life without

36:17.584 --> 36:19.953
possibility of parole.

36:19.986 --> 36:22.122
Heinous as this crime was,

36:22.155 --> 36:23.624
we feel this criminal
does not deserve

36:23.657 --> 36:25.692
to pay the ultimate price.

36:28.629 --> 36:30.564
The committee's work
is done.

36:30.597 --> 36:31.798
We're adjourned.

36:37.070 --> 36:38.705
MR. EZEKIEL: God bless you

36:38.739 --> 36:40.473
for your mercy.

36:40.507 --> 36:42.475
God bless each one of you.

36:53.353 --> 36:54.555
I almost cried.

36:55.956 --> 36:57.457
I've sat in on so many
of those committees

36:57.490 --> 36:58.592
from the other side,

36:58.625 --> 37:00.399
but this time,

37:03.002 --> 37:04.538
I just took off
all my clothes

37:04.571 --> 37:07.173
and began to sing
as loud as I could.

37:09.843 --> 37:11.277
Then I jumped up
on the table

37:11.310 --> 37:13.146
and began a tap dance, naked.

37:16.049 --> 37:17.350
So, how did you and Lindsay

37:17.383 --> 37:18.785
become so disconnected?

37:18.818 --> 37:22.088
You're such a profound
listener.

37:22.122 --> 37:23.356
Sorry.

37:23.389 --> 37:24.457
I was a little...

37:26.627 --> 37:27.994
What were you
thinking about?

37:29.596 --> 37:30.330
I never thought

37:30.363 --> 37:31.732
I'd ever have an affair.

37:35.536 --> 37:37.137
And here I am having one.

37:39.906 --> 37:40.674
We're having dinner.

37:40.707 --> 37:42.275
Like you say...

37:42.308 --> 37:43.677
innocent.

37:43.710 --> 37:45.612
Whether I kiss you

37:45.646 --> 37:47.413
or sleep with you,

37:47.447 --> 37:49.683
that only changes
the degree, Sarah.

37:52.218 --> 37:53.353
I'm having dinner
with a woman

37:53.386 --> 37:54.588
I'm attracted to.

37:57.457 --> 37:58.358
Well, Bobby, I've committed

37:58.391 --> 37:59.560
to the simple
friendship theory.

37:59.593 --> 38:00.500
Why can't you?

38:00.534 --> 38:02.102
Oh, come on.

38:02.135 --> 38:03.169
You're here in the spirit

38:03.203 --> 38:04.337
of simple friendship?

38:04.370 --> 38:05.672
Why not?

38:07.641 --> 38:08.575
The truth is I don't have

38:08.609 --> 38:09.375
that many friends anymore.

38:09.409 --> 38:10.310
I moved off to D. C.,

38:10.343 --> 38:12.078
and now I'm back.

38:12.879 --> 38:14.548
Most of my friends
have settled.

38:14.581 --> 38:16.182
They have families.

38:17.450 --> 38:18.384
I don't even have
a close girlfriend

38:18.418 --> 38:19.419
that I can call up and say,

38:19.452 --> 38:20.921
"Gee, I'm falling
for this great guy,

38:20.954 --> 38:22.388
but he's married."

38:24.691 --> 38:26.392
Scary stuff like that

38:36.803 --> 38:38.772
it helps to have
somebody to talk to.

38:50.684 --> 38:51.852
This is getting more dangerous

38:51.885 --> 38:52.753
than I want it to.

38:56.523 --> 38:58.391
I think I should go home.

39:02.903 --> 39:04.070
Okay.

39:11.778 --> 39:13.246
When did this come in?

39:13.279 --> 39:14.881
Just now.

39:14.915 --> 39:15.716
How can this be?

39:15.749 --> 39:17.618
What happened?

39:17.651 --> 39:18.919
The Attorney General rejected

39:18.952 --> 39:20.621
the committee's recommendation.

39:21.054 --> 39:22.055
What?

39:22.656 --> 39:23.790
"Under orders of the Office

39:23.824 --> 39:24.725
of the Attorney General,

39:24.758 --> 39:26.292
the United States
Attorneys' Office

39:26.326 --> 39:27.327
has filed a motion

39:27.360 --> 39:30.096
to seek the execution
of your client,

39:30.130 --> 39:31.565
Troy Ezekiel."

39:31.598 --> 39:33.499
He can just overrule
the committee?

39:33.534 --> 39:34.300
Here he is.

39:35.335 --> 39:37.237
Talking about our case?

39:37.270 --> 39:38.872
No. Just the death penalty
in general.

39:38.905 --> 39:40.874
...the United States
Congress speaks,

39:40.907 --> 39:42.442
they speak the voice
of the people

39:42.475 --> 39:43.309
of this country,

39:43.343 --> 39:45.111
and it's clear that America

39:45.145 --> 39:47.080
is so concerned
about the safety

39:47.113 --> 39:48.481
and security of its citizens

39:48.515 --> 39:49.650
that certain crimes

39:49.683 --> 39:51.184
against the people
of this country

39:51.217 --> 39:52.185
have been designated

39:52.218 --> 39:53.419
as death-eligible

39:53.453 --> 39:55.121
by the Congress
of the United States,

39:55.155 --> 39:56.322
signed into law by presidents.

39:56.356 --> 39:58.592
MAN: Mr. Attorney General...

40:08.274 --> 40:10.844
(sighs)

40:10.877 --> 40:12.312
I'm sorry.

40:12.345 --> 40:13.947
Listen, I, I...

40:13.980 --> 40:16.149
I wanted you to stop it.

40:16.182 --> 40:17.651
I wouldn't have had
the discipline

40:17.684 --> 40:18.752
and the common sense
in the end,

40:18.785 --> 40:19.786
so I'm glad.

40:21.888 --> 40:22.756
I agree.

40:22.789 --> 40:24.390
It's best we stop now

40:24.424 --> 40:26.092
before it does get
too dangerous.

40:32.633 --> 40:34.400
Excuse me.
Where the hell's my car?

40:34.434 --> 40:35.335
MAN: It's coming.

40:35.368 --> 40:36.369
It's just really important

40:36.402 --> 40:37.504
that I get out of here.

40:40.607 --> 40:42.543
(vehicle approaches)

40:45.111 --> 40:46.312
Again, thanks for dinner.

40:56.022 --> 40:57.057
Are you okay?

40:57.090 --> 40:58.892
Sure, I'm fine.

41:01.434 --> 41:03.069
Maybe we'll see
each other in court.

41:04.638 --> 41:05.572
Yeah.

41:07.040 --> 41:08.074
Bye.

41:09.109 --> 41:10.176
Bye.

41:35.602 --> 41:37.571
(engine revving)

41:37.604 --> 41:40.541
(music playing)

42:14.548 --> 42:16.082
YOUNG: Next on The Practice.

42:16.116 --> 42:17.551
DOLE: I saw you kissing
Sarah Barker

42:17.584 --> 42:19.319
outside an Italian
restaurant.

42:19.352 --> 42:21.121
Given I do have a history,

42:21.154 --> 42:22.723
maybe you should hide
the bullets

42:22.756 --> 42:23.790
on those nights you plan

42:23.824 --> 42:25.091
to commit adultery.

42:28.629 --> 42:30.496
See the tape, and the wires

42:30.531 --> 42:31.998
they're connected to bombs.

42:32.032 --> 42:33.867
Anyone tries to come
in this room. Boom!

42:33.900 --> 42:36.036
BERLUTI: Grace, what the hell
is going on here?

42:36.069 --> 42:37.137
It gets crazier.

42:37.170 --> 42:38.972
Check out the cannon.

42:39.005 --> 42:41.141
My idea for a reality

42:41.174 --> 42:41.942
television show,

42:41.975 --> 42:44.244
How to Blow Up

42:44.277 --> 42:46.379
A Network President.

42:48.715 --> 42:52.185
(music playing)

43:14.781 --> 43:16.049
WOMAN: You stinker!

43:16.249 --> 43:19.119
(music playing)
