it's all your fault.

01:02.940 --> 01:06.700
You just had to screw around with
that stupid cat. I'm glad it broke.

You want me to punch you in
the mouth? Boys, knock it off.

01:10.060 --> 01:14.020
Do something constructive. Why don't
you practise your football plays?

01:15.100 --> 01:18.180
Ouch! He hit me. Breeze. Yes, sir.

01:18.340 --> 01:21.740
Here's a good one -

You got that, Willie?

02:38.860 --> 02:42.780

They're warm. Way too warm.

and Miss Schooler,

04:59.180 --> 05:01.500
I want you to run some numbers
on the spiral bands,

05:01.660 --> 05:05.820
and get back to me ASAP.
I'll have it in five.

Hey, buddy.

999 millibars now.

in sync.

So, I need those drones
airborne quick. I'm on it.

to do it all over again.

their roadblocks are set up.

Now, Clayton, best
to evacuate first,

06:29.860 --> 06:31.540
and double-guess yourself later.

to me the better.

just keep it professional, right.

bits. Is everything OK?

Yeah. Cargo offloaded?

It's all here, with about 300
million of its cousins.

13:29.380 --> 13:33.060

Yeah, I know. Addressed it.

13:33.220 --> 13:36.380
Look, don't forget that 600 million
is your responsibility

13:36.540 --> 13:40.020
until it is destroyed, OK.
You've got no problems with that.

for you after Utah.

wouldn't even have a job right now.

13:51.060 --> 13:52.940

It's not really a job. I think
we both know what this is.

13:59.140 --> 14:02.060
Look, I made a bad call.

14:02.220 --> 14:04.660

I already punish myself.

responsibility,

17:21.579 --> 17:26.020
As I remember it, you had a
keen interest in her biology.

17:31.340 --> 17:33.620
What you doing here, Willie?

17:33.780 --> 17:37.700
There is a hurricane coming,
and it's going to be a mother.

17:41.380 --> 17:42.940
Some breakfast?

17:44.900 --> 17:47.020
Yeah, and I'm a...

17:52.060 --> 17:53.300
What was her name?

17:53.420 --> 17:55.260
Jaguar. Jaguar.

17:57.020 --> 17:58.700
Well, we are what we are, Willie.

17:58.820 --> 18:00.540
Can't change people.

18:01.660 --> 18:04.220
You sure as shit
can't change hurricanes.

18:04.380 --> 18:06.460
Well, this hurricane
can change people

18:06.620 --> 18:08.540
from life to death,
so we got to go.

18:08.700 --> 18:10.740
Yeah, I've seen them before,
brother.

18:10.900 --> 18:13.700
Not like this. I'm telling you,
this is worse than...

18:15.580 --> 18:17.220
The one that killed dad?

18:18.020 --> 18:19.540
Yeah.

18:22.220 --> 18:24.060
Red dog, Omaha, 22.

18:29.780 --> 18:31.620
They're good hands.

18:31.740 --> 18:33.940
You always had good hands.

18:34.060 --> 18:36.460
We got to go.

18:40.420 --> 18:44.140
You wasted a trip, baby bro.
I ain't gonna leave.

18:46.460 --> 18:48.700
Look around, man, because this...

18:48.860 --> 18:51.100
(HE WHISTLES)
..it's my entire life around here.

18:51.260 --> 18:53.860
But you got the cash, and the
airplane tickets I sent, right?

18:53.980 --> 18:56.780
Yeah, I got it all right here.

19:01.020 --> 19:03.820
Take your pity somewhere else,
please.

19:09.580 --> 19:10.980
You need a fresh start, bro.

19:11.140 --> 19:13.060
I make a fresh start
every day, Will.

19:13.180 --> 19:16.300
It's just not so fresh by dark.

19:16.460 --> 19:19.620
And all I got to do is freshen
it right back up again.

19:19.780 --> 19:22.500
Breeze, if this storm
is what I think it is,

19:22.660 --> 19:27.020
they ain't ever seen
anything like it.

19:27.140 --> 19:29.620
OK, I'll buy.

19:32.220 --> 19:35.740
But you're going to help me board up
the windows first, ain't you?

19:37.940 --> 19:41.140
You... You got a hammer?

19:47.580 --> 19:51.060
Heard you got phone trouble?
Got a call from a guy named Moreno.

19:51.220 --> 19:52.860
There is no clearance
for you here, sir.

19:53.020 --> 19:55.980
Corporal, we placed a T20 for
a transponder tower six,

19:56.140 --> 19:59.940
got a lane open, have to shift it
over from the source, which is here.

20:00.100 --> 20:02.100
Sir, we are on lockdown,
due to the storm.

20:02.260 --> 20:04.820
You need special clearance,
which you do not have.

20:04.980 --> 20:07.780
Come on, man, we're just doing
our job here. Let us in.

20:07.940 --> 20:10.380
Sir, this is a federal facility,
I need you to turn

20:10.540 --> 20:13.380
this vehicle around,
and I need you to turnaround now.

20:24.140 --> 20:26.700

20:38.860 --> 20:41.180
Are we in any danger?
There's been a breach.

20:43.860 --> 20:46.700
You are safe in here,
all this glass is bullet-proof.

20:48.100 --> 20:50.820
So I need you to
stay calm, and stay put.

What should we do, Connor?
Take a nap.

Come on!

22:02.140 --> 22:03.700
(SOLDIERS CRY OUT)

22:12.060 --> 22:14.620
We got a situation?
What's going on, Mr Perkins?

22:17.100 --> 22:18.940
What are you doing?

22:19.060 --> 22:20.620
(MUFFLED) What are you doing?

22:33.220 --> 22:35.820
And you said we couldn't do
this with zero casualties?

22:35.940 --> 22:37.340
You may not want to face it now,

22:37.500 --> 22:40.260
but eventually we may have to kill
some people to get what we want.

22:40.420 --> 22:42.860
Let's get these guys locked up.
Let's break out the P90s.

22:42.980 --> 22:44.620
Let's get the money. Amen.

22:55.020 --> 22:58.700
It's bullet-proof, man,
you're wasting your time.

22:58.820 --> 23:00.300
What if I say...

23:01.220 --> 23:03.900
..open sesame?

23:04.060 --> 23:08.140
I have a thing about open sesame,
ever since I read Ali Baba as a kid.

23:08.260 --> 23:10.380
Drop the gun, Moreno.

23:13.300 --> 23:16.180
I should have known there was
something hinky about
you two freaks.

23:16.340 --> 23:18.700
We two freaks hacked
your shredder weeks ago,

23:18.820 --> 23:20.140
so that the money would pile up.

23:20.300 --> 23:22.380
Of course, we had
to gamble on the storm,

23:22.500 --> 23:24.980
but all of life has its little risks.

23:25.140 --> 23:28.660
Now, we managed to take this place
without spilling a drop of blood.

23:28.820 --> 23:31.620
I want to keep it that way,
so I need your help.

23:31.780 --> 23:34.500
Now, should you choose
not to help us,

23:34.620 --> 23:37.020
the no blood rule will be revoked.

23:37.140 --> 23:38.740
This is not your money.

23:38.900 --> 23:42.060
The government's not going
to give it to your widow, Brenda,

23:42.220 --> 23:45.020
if you fall on your sword
here now, are they?

23:45.140 --> 23:46.820
This is a federal facility, man.

23:48.180 --> 23:51.300
You know what you're facing
when they catch you.

23:51.460 --> 23:54.380
Oh, I'd rather be facing
that, than us.

23:58.260 --> 23:59.580
The vault, how long?

23:59.740 --> 24:02.820
We have to substitute an I/O device
by loading a hunger striker routine

24:02.980 --> 24:05.500
into one of the monitor's wormholes.

Casey Corbin, Treasury.

24:36.900 --> 24:39.940
Our generator's down, I understand
you're responsible for repairs.

24:40.100 --> 24:44.660
Yeah, I'll go and get my tools.
Breeze, what about the boards?

24:44.780 --> 24:46.860
My government needs me, Will.

24:46.980 --> 24:48.460
You done this before.

of free labour? Apparently so.

Yeah, I know that game.
This yours?

24:56.340 --> 24:58.860
You one of those hurricane chasers?

24:58.980 --> 25:01.620
No, I'm one of those meteorologists.

Anybody who chases hurricanes
got a death wish.

Will, buddy, you going to be here
when I get back?

25:16.820 --> 25:19.220
No. OK.

25:23.500 --> 25:25.380
See you in another five years.

25:49.500 --> 25:52.780
Did real good, kid.

25:52.900 --> 25:55.300
Really proud of you. Done very well.

25:56.500 --> 26:00.180
But tonight, we're going to
be the richest punk

26:00.340 --> 26:02.980
to ever come out
of Phyllis Point. Nice.

26:05.300 --> 26:06.860
So you're a hometown boy?

26:08.300 --> 26:10.180
Uh-huh.

26:10.340 --> 26:13.220
But I took the small detour
to Afghanistan and back,

26:13.380 --> 26:15.580
but that was just to
break up the monotony.

26:17.180 --> 26:18.740
It'll do that.

26:18.900 --> 26:23.140
Now, you see that? That right there
was my last official glory zone.

Six brothers? Yeah.

into her bots. Try it again.

Tell me what is going on.
The code, it's not working.

27:20.300 --> 27:23.980
You told us you hacked it solid.
We did. We ran it this morning.

27:24.140 --> 27:26.500
Then why can't you open it?
This was your only job.

27:26.620 --> 27:28.140
Somebody changed the code.

27:34.220 --> 27:38.100
It wasn't me. That can only
come from Washington.

27:38.220 --> 27:40.500
Or the Washington liaison.

27:43.980 --> 27:45.580
Casey Corbin.

27:45.740 --> 27:50.380
We can work through our dedicated
cell, do the hack all over.

27:50.500 --> 27:53.020
Let's work on two fronts, Connor.

27:53.180 --> 27:55.420

hack all over again,

want help, just say the word.

You left with my brother,

31:28.580 --> 31:31.500
I didn't see him. Where is he?
I think they have him.

31:31.660 --> 31:33.940
Think who has him?
The crew that somehow managed

31:34.100 --> 31:36.140
to knock over a
maximum security facility.

31:36.260 --> 31:37.580
We got to go back.

31:37.740 --> 31:40.460
Wait. These guys must be pretty
heavy hitters to pull this off.

31:40.620 --> 31:43.620
They're not just going to hand him
over because we ask. They need him.

31:43.740 --> 31:45.300
Need him for what?

31:45.460 --> 31:48.260
The backup generator's down,
he's the only one that can fix it.

31:48.420 --> 31:50.420
They're going to need
power to get in the vault.

31:50.580 --> 31:53.380
So once he's through that,
they're through with him.

focused, OK?

about to be crushed

I don't think you know what
that means.

32:10.460 --> 32:13.700
It means no-one is going to
come here and volunteer to help
until it's over,

32:13.900 --> 32:17.700
and at that point it's going to be
too late for my brother.

tell me all about it.

34:03.460 --> 34:05.820
there's bound to be more.

No, no, don't, listen,
listen to me, Rice...

55:11.380 --> 55:12.700
We don't get the money,

55:12.860 --> 55:16.180
they both died for nothing,
and we are left with nothing.

55:17.220 --> 55:21.140
That's all we got left, me
and you. The money, OK.

55:21.300 --> 55:25.140
You know, there is
a strange irony in all this.

55:26.420 --> 55:29.620
It was us who planned to
use the hurricane,

55:29.740 --> 55:33.140
and by some crazy twist of fate,

55:33.300 --> 55:38.100
we collide with somebody who
knows it better than us.

55:38.220 --> 55:41.300
Boys. What the hell?

55:41.460 --> 55:45.780
Simple, the sheriff had a
plan within a plan all along.

55:47.140 --> 55:51.660
It's like I said,
fate works in crazy ways.

55:52.700 --> 55:55.140
Like when I was sitting in a bar,
on my own,

55:55.260 --> 55:57.020
bitching about my lot in life,

55:57.180 --> 56:01.620
and right next to me was
another man doing the same thing.

56:01.740 --> 56:04.140
What are you telling me this for?

56:04.300 --> 56:11.020
I was there, you idiot.
Well, not such an idiot, obviously.

56:14.620 --> 56:17.500
Everything was planned perfectly.

56:19.180 --> 56:22.860
All we needed was
one little hurricane,

56:22.980 --> 56:24.980
but you screwed it up,

56:25.140 --> 56:29.060
because you didn't have the balls
to pull this off in the right way.

56:29.180 --> 56:31.900
So everything went sideways.

56:33.340 --> 56:34.900
Well, I'm taking over now.

56:36.180 --> 56:39.420
Boys, we are going
to get that gal,

56:39.580 --> 56:42.860
and cattle prod her privates,
until she gives us the code.

56:45.260 --> 56:48.740
And after that...

56:48.860 --> 56:51.220
..the money's all mine.

56:51.380 --> 56:54.780
You hear? You hear me loud
and clear, boy?

56:54.900 --> 56:56.220
No, hold your fire.

56:57.500 --> 57:01.820
Well, that was loud,
and very clear.

57:01.940 --> 57:05.780
I have a proposal. Speak your piece.

57:06.820 --> 57:10.380
Stick with me, and I promise you
all 20 million apiece.

57:12.300 --> 57:16.620
I don't mind partners,
but I do hate witnesses.

57:18.620 --> 57:20.660
What's it going to be?

57:22.940 --> 57:26.580
Well, I think
we can work with that.

57:29.740 --> 57:32.540
But there will be
no money to split,

57:32.700 --> 57:36.660
unless we can get that woman
in here to open the vault.

57:39.620 --> 57:42.980
It sounds insane. You really think
this could work? This...

57:43.100 --> 57:44.380
Pressure inversion. Right.

57:44.540 --> 57:46.700
It's risky, but it's the
best chance we've got.

57:46.820 --> 57:47.940
Those are some slim odds.

57:48.060 --> 57:49.260
Make the call.

57:50.900 --> 57:53.780
Come in. This is Agent Corbin.
Do you read me? Over.

57:54.940 --> 57:57.260
RADIO: Casey.
Nice of you to check in.

57:57.420 --> 57:59.740
I didn't peg you for
a traitor, Connor.

57:59.860 --> 58:01.460
Guess you can forget about that

58:01.620 --> 58:04.380
retirement in Ireland,
just a nice Supermax for you.

58:04.500 --> 58:06.060
I doubt that's why you called.

58:06.220 --> 58:09.100
I'm tired of running, I'm ready
to make a deal, a trade.

58:09.220 --> 58:11.140
What kind of trade?

58:11.300 --> 58:14.820
You release all the hostages, and
I will come in and open the vault.

58:14.940 --> 58:16.740
You can have it all.

58:16.860 --> 58:18.300
That sounds too good to be true,

58:18.460 --> 58:21.220
coming from an
ambitious girl like you.

58:21.380 --> 58:25.020
I don't want anyone else to die.
Money or garbage, it's not mine.

58:25.180 --> 58:28.340
I will give you one hostage,
one for one.

58:28.500 --> 58:30.980
No deal.
Then people start to die.

58:32.540 --> 58:35.540
Starting with your friend
Moreno here. Two hostages.

58:35.660 --> 58:37.540
Release Moreno and the repair guy,

58:37.700 --> 58:41.540
and I will come in. After you get the
money, release all of the army guys.

58:42.780 --> 58:46.380
Do we have a deal? Deal.
Where are you?

58:46.500 --> 58:48.260
Get proof of life?

58:48.380 --> 58:51.780
Casey, where are you?

58:51.940 --> 58:55.340
Not so fast. First you have
to prove they're still alive.

58:55.540 --> 58:57.180
Gonna need to talk
to Breeze Rutledge.

58:57.300 --> 59:01.180
Get the repair guy out.

59:01.340 --> 59:04.660
And put Agent Moreno on.
Let me talk to him.

59:09.540 --> 59:12.020
It's me, Casey.

59:12.140 --> 59:13.860
Thank you.

59:14.020 --> 59:16.860
No need to thank me, Randy,
we are on the same team.

59:19.020 --> 59:20.740
Will. Here.

59:23.220 --> 59:25.620
Someone wants to talk to you.

59:27.300 --> 59:30.820
RADIO: Breeze, red dog, Omaha, 22.

59:32.940 --> 59:38.180
Hey, kid. Breeze, you in one piece?

59:38.300 --> 59:40.180
Still breathing.

59:40.300 --> 59:41.660
I thought you left.

59:43.100 --> 59:45.420
Nah, I got to missing you too much.

59:46.540 --> 59:49.380
Good old Willie.

59:50.740 --> 59:54.940
Listen, brother, save yourself, man.

59:55.060 --> 59:56.580
They're gonna kill me anyway.

01:00:00.860 --> 01:00:03.660
Just be cool.

01:00:03.780 --> 01:00:05.620
All right?

01:00:05.780 --> 01:00:08.660
Everything is going
to be OK. You'll see.

01:00:11.100 --> 01:00:12.860
I love you.

01:00:13.020 --> 01:00:17.660
I love you, too. In fact, everybody
loves everybody around here.

01:00:17.780 --> 01:00:19.220
Now, where are you?

01:00:19.380 --> 01:00:21.980
We are at the mall.
Which mall?

01:00:23.700 --> 01:00:25.420
There is only one mall in Gulfport.

01:00:25.540 --> 01:00:28.340
Figure it out.

01:00:28.460 --> 01:00:30.700
Course there is.

01:00:33.580 --> 01:00:36.500
Put this on. It's a safety harness.

01:00:39.620 --> 01:00:44.140
I tried everything, there's no word.
He's just gone.

01:00:44.300 --> 01:00:47.460
You got to hand it to him,
he was right.

01:00:49.020 --> 01:00:51.500
Tammy is going off the chart.

01:00:56.780 --> 01:00:58.900
I used to shop here with my daddy.

01:00:59.060 --> 01:01:01.900
We had a small Catalina,
16-and-a-half footer,

01:01:02.060 --> 01:01:04.940
used to take it out on the Gulf
in the summertimes. It was fun.

01:01:09.460 --> 01:01:10.980
Now you're armed.

01:01:16.780 --> 01:01:19.060
Get in there.

01:01:27.820 --> 01:01:31.020
Show yourselves.
We got the place surrounded.

01:01:34.340 --> 01:01:35.740
Come on out.

01:01:36.620 --> 01:01:39.020
Come out, wherever you are.

01:01:39.900 --> 01:01:44.700
Move. OK, hold it.
Show yourselves.

01:01:48.460 --> 01:01:50.500
That's far enough.

01:01:50.620 --> 01:01:52.660
We don't want no trouble, man.

01:01:52.820 --> 01:01:55.780
We're in for the
Treasury woman, right.

01:01:55.940 --> 01:01:58.940
This is the deal.
Now, where is she?

01:02:02.020 --> 01:02:05.260
She right here somewhere,
she just loves shopping.

01:02:05.420 --> 01:02:08.820
Next joke will cost you, asshole.
The girl, or he dies.

01:02:10.300 --> 01:02:11.820
How you doing down there, Breeze?

01:02:11.980 --> 01:02:15.660
Well, I'm just waiting for my
quarterback to call the play.

01:02:15.820 --> 01:02:18.500
This play just a little flea flicker,
I might signal go long.

01:02:18.660 --> 01:02:20.740
Shut your yap up,
and send her out now.

01:02:20.860 --> 01:02:23.700
OK, OK. Casey.

01:02:26.300 --> 01:02:29.660
Where's Moreno?
Oh, he's safe and sound.

01:02:29.820 --> 01:02:32.620
You can trust us,
we're the police.

01:02:37.660 --> 01:02:38.820
Now.

01:03:30.220 --> 01:03:31.860
Look out.

01:04:13.180 --> 01:04:18.220
Breeze. Breeze, come out,
it's me and Casey.

01:04:21.060 --> 01:04:24.500
Guess he figured this would be
the first place they'd look.

01:04:29.260 --> 01:04:31.740
Got you a gift.

01:04:31.860 --> 01:04:34.940
It was my daddy's.

01:04:37.100 --> 01:04:41.500
Beauty. Browning.

01:04:41.660 --> 01:04:43.900
Well, eight rounds
is better than nothing.

01:04:48.300 --> 01:04:50.980
Thank you.

01:04:54.340 --> 01:04:56.460
How long do you think we have before
it passes?

01:04:56.580 --> 01:04:58.020
I mean, it's moving real quick.

01:04:58.860 --> 01:05:01.900
I think the eye of the storm is
going to be over us real soon.

01:05:02.060 --> 01:05:04.340
It's confusing how in songs,
they always say

01:05:04.500 --> 01:05:07.140
into the eye of the storm,
and that's the calm part.

01:05:07.300 --> 01:05:09.460
Yeah, it can be the
most beautiful place,

01:05:09.620 --> 01:05:11.860
20-40 miles wide, like a
warm summer's day,

01:05:12.020 --> 01:05:15.900
but the eye wall, that's a different
story. That's the real killer.

01:05:16.060 --> 01:05:17.820
You know, it's the layer
around the ring,

01:05:17.980 --> 01:05:21.220
that's fuelled by thunderstorms
on an atomic bomb level.

01:05:21.380 --> 01:05:26.420
I mean, you get trapped in that,
sure enough, it's death. Great.

01:05:28.300 --> 01:05:29.940
Ain't nothing in there but poison.

01:05:31.300 --> 01:05:36.020
I got what you want. What you want is
peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.

01:05:36.140 --> 01:05:38.220
Yes, really.

01:05:43.380 --> 01:05:44.620
Cool.

01:05:45.620 --> 01:05:48.820
Yes. Fricking love Monday,
you weirdo.

01:05:57.340 --> 01:05:58.860
Is this Jif?

01:05:58.980 --> 01:06:02.340
No, I'm a Skippy guy, so Skip.

01:06:02.500 --> 01:06:05.300
Really. It's Smucker's strawberry
though.

01:06:05.420 --> 01:06:07.140
Correctamundo.

01:06:10.900 --> 01:06:13.260
They're going to use the eye
to escape, aren't they?

01:06:13.380 --> 01:06:14.700
It's what I'd do.

01:06:14.860 --> 01:06:16.820
Roll-out in the middle,
let it dissipate,

01:06:16.980 --> 01:06:18.980
which it's going to do
when it gets inland.

01:06:20.660 --> 01:06:22.820
We should take the fight to them.

01:06:22.940 --> 01:06:25.820
How do you mean? Car bomb.

01:06:25.980 --> 01:06:29.860
We detonate it at a safe
distance, but car bomb.

01:06:30.020 --> 01:06:31.860
We just need ammonia,
fertiliser, diesel,

01:06:32.020 --> 01:06:34.100
things we can get at a
garden supply store.

01:06:34.220 --> 01:06:35.660
How the hell do you know that?

01:06:35.820 --> 01:06:37.940
When you are a Fed they
teach you this shit.

01:06:38.100 --> 01:06:42.540
Timothy McVeigh took
out the Federal Building with that.

01:06:42.660 --> 01:06:44.180
You just load up a car,

01:06:44.340 --> 01:06:47.860
plant it at the gate, when
they convoy out, blow it.

01:06:47.980 --> 01:06:51.220
OK, so we are going to need a car.

01:06:51.340 --> 01:06:55.420
One that's not on its roof.

01:06:55.580 --> 01:07:00.420
Would need to be watertight,
have a decent electrical system.

01:07:00.580 --> 01:07:02.860
Yeah, where we going to find
a car like that?

01:07:07.900 --> 01:07:10.300
(HE LAUGHS)
The Dominator?

01:07:10.460 --> 01:07:14.900
No. No. Are you kidding?
This is a federal vehicle.

01:07:15.060 --> 01:07:17.900
Federal property,
so is the $600 million,

01:07:18.060 --> 01:07:21.740
they would buy you a fleet
of these things for that, Will.

01:07:24.780 --> 01:07:26.180
No.

01:07:26.300 --> 01:07:28.460
I need your help.

01:07:34.700 --> 01:07:37.020
Found it.

01:07:38.140 --> 01:07:42.020
She's got enough gas to get
more bang for your buck.

01:07:47.300 --> 01:07:49.420
They must have seen The Dominator.

01:07:49.540 --> 01:07:52.540
I'll look for a way out the back.

01:07:52.660 --> 01:07:55.180
(ALARM)

01:08:05.620 --> 01:08:08.780
No shit today, Casey.
I know you're in here.

01:08:10.660 --> 01:08:12.820
There's four of us,
all with automatics,

01:08:12.940 --> 01:08:14.180
against whatever you got.

01:08:14.340 --> 01:08:16.380
You need me, I'm the only
one with the code.

01:08:16.500 --> 01:08:17.899
The protection is only for you.

01:08:19.020 --> 01:08:21.859
It doesn't apply to your boyfriend.

01:08:21.979 --> 01:08:23.540
I'll tell you what.

01:08:23.660 --> 01:08:26.340
You let him drive away unharmed,

01:08:26.500 --> 01:08:30.300
and I will come in and open
the safe. No, no, no.

01:08:30.420 --> 01:08:33.100
Call him out.

01:08:36.580 --> 01:08:38.620
Call him out!

01:08:41.899 --> 01:08:44.100
Go!

01:08:44.220 --> 01:08:47.380
(THEY SCREAM)

01:09:25.540 --> 01:09:27.100
(SHE GROANS)

01:09:35.540 --> 01:09:38.220
(ALARMS SOUND)

01:10:04.540 --> 01:10:06.380
(HE LAUGHS)

01:10:23.380 --> 01:10:26.380
Help!

01:10:39.220 --> 01:10:40.780
(HE CHUCKLES)

01:10:55.380 --> 01:10:58.540
Will.

01:10:59.860 --> 01:11:03.500
Willie. Will.

01:11:03.620 --> 01:11:05.860
Hey, Will.

01:11:07.940 --> 01:11:11.780
Here. Come here, buddy.

01:11:11.900 --> 01:11:15.420
Get on. Come on.

01:11:15.540 --> 01:11:19.260
I got you. I got you. I lost Casey.

01:11:19.420 --> 01:11:22.900
I saw her, they got her.
First things first, buddy.

01:11:23.020 --> 01:11:25.420
First things first.

01:11:39.980 --> 01:11:42.820
Moreno. You're alive.

01:11:42.940 --> 01:11:45.460
No, no, no, no, the money.

01:11:45.620 --> 01:11:49.140
We had a deal - you let
him go, and I'll open it.

01:11:49.300 --> 01:11:53.500
You are in a piss poor position
to negotiate, lady.

01:11:53.620 --> 01:11:55.420
No.

01:11:56.460 --> 01:11:59.580
Frears, turn the shredder on.

01:12:06.260 --> 01:12:09.620
What? Are you going to shred me?

01:12:09.740 --> 01:12:11.500
Oh, not you. Him.

01:12:12.340 --> 01:12:14.580
No, no. Hey.

01:12:14.700 --> 01:12:16.620
(SHOUTING)

01:12:16.740 --> 01:12:18.500
Wait, you win. Stop.

01:12:23.380 --> 01:12:25.540
You win.

01:12:26.380 --> 01:12:27.780
You win.

01:12:38.980 --> 01:12:41.340
It was here all the time.

01:13:09.020 --> 01:13:11.100
(METAL CLANGS)

01:13:15.020 --> 01:13:17.940
Boy, come to papa.

01:13:18.060 --> 01:13:19.780
(HE LAUGHS)

01:13:25.900 --> 01:13:29.860
A priest once said to me, 'Money
won't get you to heaven, Connor.'

01:13:31.300 --> 01:13:34.420
Clearly he never saw this.

01:13:36.860 --> 01:13:38.420
(TWO GUNSHOTS)

01:13:39.420 --> 01:13:41.300
Randy.

01:13:45.140 --> 01:13:49.300
That is what you get for
causing us so much trouble.

01:13:50.220 --> 01:13:53.140
That is for Zander,
that is for Jackie.

01:13:55.500 --> 01:13:58.260
I will kill you for this.

01:13:58.380 --> 01:14:01.540
Everybody else has tried.

01:14:01.660 --> 01:14:02.980
Why not you?

01:14:03.140 --> 01:14:08.420
Let's load up. Bring her,
I'm not done with her just yet.

01:14:28.020 --> 01:14:31.620
Put that around you, Willie.

01:14:31.740 --> 01:14:33.020
All right, let's suit up, man.

01:14:33.140 --> 01:14:35.980
This your vitamins.

01:14:36.940 --> 01:14:39.020
Something warm.

01:14:39.140 --> 01:14:41.060
Definitely need some of this.

01:14:41.180 --> 01:14:42.700
What in the hell?

01:14:43.780 --> 01:14:47.220
Well, I am a citizen of Alabama.

01:14:47.340 --> 01:14:49.100
Here, man.

01:14:49.220 --> 01:14:51.420
Come on, Willie, take your pick.

01:14:51.580 --> 01:14:54.220
No, I'd only wind up
shooting you or me.

01:14:58.300 --> 01:15:01.380
That's the eye of the storm.
About 40 miles wide,

01:15:01.540 --> 01:15:05.180
it could be like a bright,
sunny day in the middle of hell.

01:15:05.340 --> 01:15:08.540
Well, dude, it's time for the
Rutledge boys to go to work.

01:15:12.700 --> 01:15:15.980
They sure as shit got the money.

01:15:16.100 --> 01:15:18.260
And they sure as shit got her, too.

01:15:19.340 --> 01:15:21.740
Let me ask you a question, Willie,

01:15:21.900 --> 01:15:25.940
we could just let the whole pack
of them go, money and all.

01:15:26.100 --> 01:15:28.460
What do they teach you in the army?
Leave no man behind.

01:15:28.620 --> 01:15:30.900
Did you forget that?
I was just testing.

01:15:31.060 --> 01:15:34.500
Nice to see you grow a
pair since this morning.

01:15:34.620 --> 01:15:35.700
Let's take the shortcut.

01:15:35.860 --> 01:15:37.980
Pick them up at
Shelley's farm, right?

01:15:49.100 --> 01:15:51.620
(HE CLEARS HIS THROAT)

01:15:51.740 --> 01:15:53.940
I need to tell you something.

01:15:55.180 --> 01:15:58.740
No, you don't.
Everything's fine.

01:15:58.860 --> 01:16:00.660
Just leave it.

01:16:00.820 --> 01:16:05.060
No, I want to apologise for
some of the things I said.

01:16:06.740 --> 01:16:08.700
Well, we all say
things we don't mean.

01:16:08.820 --> 01:16:10.420
Forget it.

01:16:10.540 --> 01:16:11.980
I can't.

01:16:12.140 --> 01:16:14.140
Look, I know you know
I was just a little kid,

01:16:14.300 --> 01:16:19.260
but I said some stuff
to try and hurt you.

01:16:19.380 --> 01:16:22.540
I get it. I get it.

01:16:22.660 --> 01:16:25.060
And I'm well and truly sorry.

01:16:27.900 --> 01:16:32.780
Well, shit, I'm sorry, too.

01:16:32.940 --> 01:16:37.340
I haven't been the best older
brother I could have been either.

01:16:37.460 --> 01:16:39.380
Lord knows I've tried, man.

01:16:41.740 --> 01:16:43.660
Just not hard enough.

01:16:47.820 --> 01:16:50.740
All right, now that we've
put all that shit out there,

01:16:50.900 --> 01:16:54.020
you've got to promise me something.
Name it.

01:16:54.140 --> 01:16:57.780
I gave you this once, once, Willie,

01:16:57.940 --> 01:17:01.220
but you've got to promise me
this is the last time

01:17:01.380 --> 01:17:04.780
we ever share our
deep, personal feelings again.

01:17:07.340 --> 01:17:10.700
Hell, yes, sir, you've
got yourself a deal.

01:17:45.100 --> 01:17:48.420
Jesus, Perkins, speed up. That thing
wants to swallow us whole.

01:17:48.540 --> 01:17:51.140
Now you know why I put you last.

01:17:51.260 --> 01:17:52.780
(HE CHUCKLES)

01:17:52.900 --> 01:17:54.460
Dick.

01:18:01.380 --> 01:18:03.780
(HE CRUNCHES THE GEARS)

01:18:05.020 --> 01:18:07.580
You can't drive this thing for shit.

01:18:07.700 --> 01:18:09.300
You want to try?

01:18:09.460 --> 01:18:12.500
It ain't easy. My brother-in-law
drove one long haul,

01:18:12.620 --> 01:18:14.340
and he was an angry son of a gun.

01:18:14.460 --> 01:18:15.580
Now I know why.

01:18:15.700 --> 01:18:17.620
Just keep it on the road.

01:18:17.780 --> 01:18:20.820
And you, nobody asked
to hear from you.

01:18:20.940 --> 01:18:22.860
Keep it zipped, hear me?

01:18:32.340 --> 01:18:35.180
You son of a...

01:18:44.580 --> 01:18:48.340
All right. You ready? No.

01:18:48.460 --> 01:18:52.180
Get your ass out of here.

01:19:09.500 --> 01:19:11.220
Send it, Willie.

01:19:25.580 --> 01:19:29.260
Whoa, come on, come on.

01:19:29.380 --> 01:19:31.780
Jump. It's too far.

01:19:31.940 --> 01:19:34.260
Come on, jump.
(HE CRIES OUT)

01:19:34.380 --> 01:19:36.460
Grab my leg.

01:19:38.540 --> 01:19:40.340
(HE GRUNTS)

01:19:45.980 --> 01:19:47.900
Grab my hand.

01:20:05.460 --> 01:20:07.220
That wasn't too far.

01:20:07.340 --> 01:20:08.460
We did it.

01:20:09.580 --> 01:20:12.820
We're on the top of a truck,
we haven't done shit.

01:20:12.980 --> 01:20:15.020
Hey, one thing I learned
in the war, man,

01:20:15.180 --> 01:20:18.140
you got to take your victories
where you find them.

01:20:18.260 --> 01:20:19.540
Let's do this.

01:20:35.820 --> 01:20:37.420
Oh, my God!

01:20:42.580 --> 01:20:44.740
Hey!
(HE CRIES OUT)

01:20:44.860 --> 01:20:46.060
Oh, my God, you shot him!

01:20:46.220 --> 01:20:48.940
Shut up! Get in the back,
before you get one in the head.

01:20:52.220 --> 01:20:54.940
I'm going to kill you.

01:20:55.100 --> 01:20:57.060
Don't even think about it,
sweet cheeks.

01:20:57.180 --> 01:20:58.500
Ready? Oh, yeah.

01:20:59.340 --> 01:21:00.500
Here goes nothing.

01:21:00.620 --> 01:21:02.380
Well, you'd better hope not.

01:21:04.980 --> 01:21:06.740
It's OK.

01:21:17.660 --> 01:21:18.900
Yeah.

01:21:19.020 --> 01:21:20.740
It's OK, baby.

01:21:34.300 --> 01:21:36.100
You killed my brother.

01:21:37.260 --> 01:21:39.700
I'm going to kill you,
no matter what Perkins says.

01:21:39.820 --> 01:21:41.340
And I'm gonna make it hurt.

01:21:41.500 --> 01:21:44.220
I know I'm not the first one
to tell you this, Rice -

01:21:44.340 --> 01:21:47.980
you got anger issues with women.

01:21:54.100 --> 01:21:56.220
See what I mean.

01:21:57.940 --> 01:21:59.220
Get her off of me!

01:21:59.340 --> 01:22:01.340
I can't keep it straight.

01:22:02.460 --> 01:22:03.740
Get off of me.

01:22:03.860 --> 01:22:06.740
(SHE CRIES OUT)

01:22:12.140 --> 01:22:13.980
You got to get off.

01:22:18.340 --> 01:22:20.540
I can't have it straight.

01:22:25.300 --> 01:22:27.420
My God.
(SHE CRIES OUT)

01:22:32.300 --> 01:22:34.860
God dammit, lady, don't make me.

01:22:48.340 --> 01:22:50.340
I'm in, Casey.

01:22:54.820 --> 01:22:57.620
Oh, shit.

01:23:20.140 --> 01:23:21.980
Get ready, Casey.

01:23:36.820 --> 01:23:38.380
(SHE BREATHES DEEPLY)

01:23:41.260 --> 01:23:44.540
Take a look outside, tell me
how far back the eye wall is.

01:23:44.660 --> 01:23:46.980
Half a mile, at most.

01:23:50.620 --> 01:23:54.820
Damn you to hell.

01:23:57.700 --> 01:23:59.900
OK, get down low, lovers.

01:24:00.020 --> 01:24:01.500
It's gonna get hot.

01:24:06.180 --> 01:24:09.020
Breeze is in trouble.
Let's go give him some help.

01:24:26.180 --> 01:24:28.100
Son of a...

01:24:33.060 --> 01:24:34.980
(HE CRIES OUT)

01:24:51.340 --> 01:24:55.020
You see what's behind us?
Yeah, it's nothing good.

01:24:55.140 --> 01:24:57.420
Red dog, Omaha, 22.

01:24:57.540 --> 01:25:02.260
What? Red dog, Omaha, 22, hut-hut.

01:25:03.660 --> 01:25:05.820
You got it.

01:25:14.940 --> 01:25:18.700
Get ready.

01:25:18.820 --> 01:25:20.660
Ah, you...

01:25:29.780 --> 01:25:33.660
Red dog, Omaha, 22, hut-hut.

01:25:38.820 --> 01:25:40.660
One more.

01:25:42.220 --> 01:25:43.980
(SHE CRIES OUT)

01:25:47.660 --> 01:25:49.900
(TYRES SCREECH)

01:25:50.020 --> 01:25:52.340
That's the Alabama Slam, baby.

01:26:18.020 --> 01:26:20.700
Oh, no.

01:26:22.660 --> 01:26:24.420
No, no.

01:26:24.540 --> 01:26:26.020
You're blocking the runner,

01:26:26.180 --> 01:26:28.420
but forcing him backwards
at the eye wall?

01:26:28.580 --> 01:26:30.700
He must have figured it out by now,
but I sure wish

01:26:30.860 --> 01:26:32.700
I could have seen
his face when he did.

01:26:43.780 --> 01:26:45.900
What? No, no, no, no!

01:26:48.140 --> 01:26:49.700
No!

01:26:52.060 --> 01:26:54.820
My money! Damn you!

01:26:54.940 --> 01:26:56.980
Damn you!

01:26:59.660 --> 01:27:00.900
Damn you!

01:27:08.380 --> 01:27:11.700
We are not going to make it.
We're not gonna make it.

01:27:16.820 --> 01:27:18.660
I'm gonna drop back.

01:27:27.540 --> 01:27:29.580
Give me your hand.

01:27:29.740 --> 01:27:31.540
All right, we're going
to transfer over.

01:27:31.700 --> 01:27:33.380
Come here. I want
you to take the wheel.

01:27:36.140 --> 01:27:39.700
Now put your foot on the gas,
right there. Can we get closer?

01:27:39.860 --> 01:27:42.660
You're going to come
over next, OK.

01:27:42.780 --> 01:27:44.220
Come on, Breeze.

01:27:44.340 --> 01:27:47.980
Get me closer.

01:27:48.100 --> 01:27:49.460
Let's go.

01:27:49.580 --> 01:27:51.900
Come on.

01:27:52.020 --> 01:27:54.460
Now.

01:28:01.300 --> 01:28:05.340
(MUFFLED CHATTER)

01:28:07.500 --> 01:28:10.060
(SCREAMING)

01:28:13.900 --> 01:28:16.980
Now punch it, Willie. I'm going.

01:28:41.460 --> 01:28:44.460
Well, Breeze, you were right.

01:28:44.580 --> 01:28:45.820
Come again.

01:28:45.980 --> 01:28:48.980
Take your victories where you
can get them. That was a mouthful.

01:28:49.100 --> 01:28:51.580
Yes, sir.

01:28:51.740 --> 01:28:54.220
We earned 200 million,
that's some kind of victory.

01:28:54.380 --> 01:28:57.500
And our lives.
That's some kind of victory.

01:28:57.620 --> 01:28:59.500
Yeah. Yeah.

01:29:02.300 --> 01:29:06.100
Listen, I've got you two partners,

01:29:06.260 --> 01:29:08.300
200 million in cash,
no-one knows shit.

01:29:09.380 --> 01:29:12.180
What do you say we turn this
truck around, head to Mexico?

01:29:13.420 --> 01:29:15.340
Mexico.

01:29:15.500 --> 01:29:17.660
Hell, I like the sound of that.

01:29:17.820 --> 01:29:20.700
Yeah, we could get into
a shit load of...

01:29:20.820 --> 01:29:23.220
Dangerous.

01:29:23.340 --> 01:29:24.740
(BREEZE CHUCKLES)

01:29:24.860 --> 01:29:26.060
But, you know...

01:29:26.220 --> 01:29:30.340
I was messing with you,
you degenerates.

01:29:30.460 --> 01:29:32.300
Oh, mercy.

01:29:35.220 --> 01:29:37.100
Red sky at night.

01:29:45.580 --> 01:29:48.340
They teach you that in PhD school?

01:29:48.460 --> 01:29:50.340
Yes, ma'am.
