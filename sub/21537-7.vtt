00:07.073 --> 00:09.642
ACCEPTED.
- YES! WE HAVE A DEAL.

00:09.676 --> 00:11.177
THANK GOD.

00:11.211 --> 00:12.912
- MAYBE WE CAN DO
A CO-LISTING.

00:12.946 --> 00:15.682
YOU HAVE TO DO AN OPEN HOUSE,
AND YOU'RE UNDER MY DIRECTION.

00:15.715 --> 00:17.884
IF YOU SELL IT,
I GIVE YOU HALF THE COMMISSION.

00:17.917 --> 00:20.553
IF I SELL IT,
YOU GET NOTHING.

00:20.587 --> 00:21.888
JIMMY JUST SENT ME
AN E-MAIL.

00:21.921 --> 00:24.924
$2,975,000 FOR THE LAST UNIT
OF 50 LISPENARD.

00:24.958 --> 00:27.527
- HIGH FIVE.
- SOLD OUT.

00:27.560 --> 00:29.729
I THINK I'LL STILL GIVE LUIS
A CHANCE TO DO THE OPEN HOUSE.

00:29.763 --> 00:31.531
YOU NEVER KNOW.

00:34.567 --> 00:36.002
BUT THE ASKING IS 2,995,000.

00:36.036 --> 00:38.605
- MARKET IS WILLING PAY $2.5
MILLION AND NOT A PENNY MORE.

00:40.240 --> 00:41.608
- WAIT, WHAT?

00:41.641 --> 00:43.009
WHAT THE HELL
IS GOING ON HERE?

00:43.043 --> 00:45.145
WHEN DID YOU KNOW
THERE WAS A CONTRACT OUT?

00:45.178 --> 00:48.081
- TWO DAYS BEFORE YOUR PARTY.

00:48.114 --> 00:51.251
[upbeat music]

00:51.284 --> 00:53.420
- MY MOTTO IS EXPANSION,

00:53.453 --> 00:56.756
ALWAYS IN ALL WAYS.

00:56.790 --> 01:00.160
- NEW YORK CITY, IT'S THE MOST
EXCITING CITY FOR REAL ESTATE,

01:00.193 --> 01:01.461
AND THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.

01:01.494 --> 01:03.963
- I'M THE CLOSER
AND A LISTING MACHINE.

01:04.064 --> 01:06.700
WHAT MAKES ME BETTER IS THAT
I WORK HARDER THAN ANYONE ELSE.

01:06.733 --> 01:08.068
- THIS IS THE SECOND TIME
YOU'VE DISRESPECTED ME, BRO.

01:08.101 --> 01:09.602
- HAVE I MET YOU BEFORE?

01:09.636 --> 01:11.671
- I WANTED THIS THING MORE THAN
ANYBODY ELSE, AND YOU KNEW IT!

01:11.705 --> 01:12.872
- IT'S OVER!

01:12.906 --> 01:15.875

01:17.777 --> 01:20.747
[techno music]

01:20.780 --> 01:23.383
* *

01:23.416 --> 01:26.386
- YOU KNEW THAT
YOU HAD A CONTRACT OUT,

01:26.419 --> 01:31.925
BUT YOU LET ME SPEND 5 GRAND
ON THIS [bleep] OPEN HOUSE?

01:31.958 --> 01:34.994
- I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH
YOUR SMOKEY PARTIES COST.

01:35.095 --> 01:37.630
I DIDN'T TELL LUIS THAT I HAD
SENT OUT A CONTRACT

01:37.664 --> 01:40.467
BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT HIM
TO LOSE HIS MOTIVATION.

01:40.500 --> 01:42.469
I WANTED TO TEST HIM OUT.

01:42.502 --> 01:45.472
I GAVE YOU A LITTLE BIT OF TIME
TO PROVE YOURSELF,

01:45.505 --> 01:47.574
AND YOU DIDN'T.
IF I WERE YOU,

01:47.607 --> 01:48.808
I WOULD STAND UP NOW,

01:48.842 --> 01:50.577
DUST YOURSELF OFF,
AND WALK AWAY.

01:50.610 --> 01:53.113
AND IF YOU WANT TO BE ANGRY
AT ME, SO BE IT.

01:53.146 --> 01:55.148
- I'M--I'M ANGRY AT YOU BECAUSE
IT'S 2.5--I'M NOT TRYING--

01:55.181 --> 01:56.383
- GET OVER IT, MY FRIEND.
GET OVER IT.

01:56.416 --> 01:57.550
- I'M NOT TRYING--
I WON'T GET OVER IT.

01:57.584 --> 02:00.920
- DROP 50 LISPENARD.
YOU LOST IT.

02:00.954 --> 02:02.455
- LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING.

02:02.489 --> 02:03.923
YOU--YOU SAW THAT
I WANTED TO SELL THIS

02:03.957 --> 02:05.325
MORE THAN ANYBODY ELSE.

02:05.358 --> 02:06.793
YOU ALREADY KNOW THAT
YOU HAD A CONTRACT OUT.

02:06.826 --> 02:08.461
MONEY, IF YOU NEED TO SPEND--
- I WANTED TO SEE IF YOU COULD--

02:08.495 --> 02:10.196
- STOP!
GIVE ME ONE SECOND!

02:10.230 --> 02:11.698
GIVE ME ONE GODDAMN SECOND,
MAN.

02:11.731 --> 02:13.867
- YOU DON'T TALK TO ME
LIKE THAT, MY FRIEND.

02:13.900 --> 02:15.068
WHERE IS THIS COMING FROM?

02:15.068 --> 02:16.870
WHAT IS THIS ANGER
TOWARDS ME?

02:16.903 --> 02:20.206
I HAVE A FIDUCIARY DUTY
TO MY CLIENT--

02:20.240 --> 02:22.342
CORRECT MYSELF, OUR CLIENT--

02:22.375 --> 02:25.078
AND HERE HE IS,
SCREAMING AT ME

02:25.111 --> 02:27.881
FOR SELLING
THE FRICKING APARTMENT.

02:27.914 --> 02:29.082
- I'M--

02:29.115 --> 02:30.083
- HOW MUCH WAS THE FRICKING
PARTY OF YOURS?

02:30.116 --> 02:31.384
- IT WAS 6 [bleep] GRAND.

02:31.418 --> 02:32.952
THAT IS--
- OH. OOH.

02:32.986 --> 02:34.721
- OH, WOW, BECAUSE YOU'RE SO
RICH, AND YOU'RE SO, LIKE,

02:34.754 --> 02:38.658
YOU SOLD $1.5 BILLION WORTH
OF [bleep] REAL ESTATE.

02:38.692 --> 02:40.827
OH, YOU'RE GOING TO
MAKE ME A CHECK?

02:40.860 --> 02:42.696
[bleep] YOU, I DON'T--I DON'T
GIVE A--THAT IS, TO ME,

02:42.729 --> 02:43.830
EVEN MORE DISRESPECTFUL.

02:43.863 --> 02:45.231
- WATCH ME WRITE THIS CHECK
FOR YOU.

02:45.265 --> 02:46.599
- I SWEAR TO GOD, MAN.

02:46.633 --> 02:48.568
I HAVE--HAVEN'T HAD A FIGHT
IN A LONG [bleep] TIME,

02:48.601 --> 02:49.936
BUT IN MY MIND,
I AM PUMMELING YOU.

02:49.969 --> 02:51.171
- WAIT. WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
WHAT'S YOUR NAME AGAIN?

02:51.204 --> 02:52.205
WHAT'S YOU--
HOW DO YOU SPELL YOUR NAME?

02:52.238 --> 02:53.239
- I AM PUMMELING
YOUR STUPID [bleep] FACE

02:53.273 --> 02:54.307
AGAINST THAT BRICK.

02:54.341 --> 02:55.608
LISTEN, STOP DOING THAT
BULL[bleep].

02:55.642 --> 02:58.011
THAT IS [bleep] DISRESPECTFUL.
- LA-LA-LA-LA-LA-LA.

02:58.111 --> 02:59.179
- DON'T BE A STUPID
[bleep] CHILD.

02:59.212 --> 03:00.480
GIVE ME THAT GODDAMN CHECK.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

03:00.513 --> 03:02.215
YOU [bleep] PIECE
OF [bleep].

03:02.248 --> 03:03.416
I SWEAR TO GOD, MAN.

03:03.450 --> 03:06.152
YOU--YOU [bleep]
MOTHER[bleep].

03:06.186 --> 03:07.520
YOU'RE A [bleep] DISGRACE.
STOP IT.

03:07.554 --> 03:08.955
HOLD ON, LISTEN TO ME.

03:09.055 --> 03:11.257
I WANTED THIS THING MORE THAN
ANY-[bleep]-BODY ELSE, MAN!

03:11.291 --> 03:14.327
I--I BLED FOR THIS
[bleep], MAN!

03:14.361 --> 03:15.695
AND YOU KNOW THAT!
I BLED FOR THIS THING!

03:15.729 --> 03:17.597
- YOU JUST--
- SHUT THE [bleep] UP, MAN.

03:17.630 --> 03:18.965
SHUT THE [bleep] UP.

03:19.065 --> 03:21.601
I-I BLED FOR THIS THING,
AND I WANTED TO DO IT

03:21.634 --> 03:24.204
MORE THAN ANYBODY ELSE,
AND YOU [bleep] PLAY ME!

03:24.237 --> 03:25.205
YOU [bleep] PLAY ME!
- I DID NOT PLAY YOU.

03:25.238 --> 03:26.373
- STOP.
SHUT THE [bleep] UP!

03:26.406 --> 03:27.907
- I DID NOT PLAY YOU.
- YOU [bleep] PLAYED ME!

03:27.941 --> 03:29.242
YOU [bleep] USED ME!
- PICK YOURSELF UP.

03:29.275 --> 03:31.911
PICK YOURSELF UP, MY FRIEND.
IT'S OVER.

03:31.945 --> 03:32.979
- YOU [bleep] USED ME, MAN.
- IT'S OVER.

03:33.079 --> 03:34.214
- YOU [bleep] USED ME,
MAN.

03:34.247 --> 03:36.216
- IT'S OVER. IT'S OVER.
IT'S OVER.

03:36.249 --> 03:38.184
- YOU'RE A GODDAMN DISGRACE,
MAN.

03:38.218 --> 03:40.854
- IT'S OVER.

03:40.887 --> 03:46.893
- YOU'RE A [...] DISGRACE,
YOU PIECE OF [bleep].

03:46.926 --> 03:49.963
- I'M OUT.
END OF STORY.

03:49.996 --> 03:53.500
- I HAVE NEVER BEEN INSULTED
LIKE THAT IN MY LIFE.

03:53.533 --> 03:55.335
I THOUGHT WE WERE PARTNERS,
AND IN A PARTNERSHIP,

03:55.368 --> 03:58.104
YOU DON'T HIDE INFORMATION
FROM EACH OTHER.

03:58.104 --> 03:59.706
TO ME, HE'S DEAD.

03:59.739 --> 04:00.874
THIS GUY IS A SCUMBAG.

04:00.907 --> 04:02.409
THIS GUY IS
A [bleep] SCUMBAG.

04:02.442 --> 04:05.545
HE PULLED THE BIGGEST SCUMBAG
MOVE OF ALL TIME.

04:05.578 --> 04:08.615
I SHOULD'VE
KICKED HIS [bleep] ASS.

04:08.648 --> 04:10.650
[bleep]!

04:15.155 --> 04:17.824
[funky music]

04:17.857 --> 04:19.259
* *

04:19.292 --> 04:24.130
- ONE BEACON COURT IS LOCATED
IN MIDTOWN EAST ON 58TH STREET.

04:24.164 --> 04:25.865
MIDTOWN EAST IS WHERE
A LOT OF BUSINESS IS DONE.

04:25.899 --> 04:29.069
IT ALSO ATTRACTS A LOT
OF INTERNATIONAL INVESTORS.

04:29.069 --> 04:31.104
AND ONE BEACON COURT'S
MY FAVORITE BUILDING,

04:31.137 --> 04:33.239
BECAUSE IT'S VERY HIGH END.

04:33.273 --> 04:34.574
[knocks on door]

04:36.076 --> 04:37.477
- RYAN.
- WHAT'S UP?

04:37.510 --> 04:39.145
- WHAT'S GOING ON?
- GOOD TO SEE YOU.

04:39.179 --> 04:40.513
IT'S BEEN A WHILE.
- YEAH. COME ON IN.

04:40.547 --> 04:43.249
- MARK IS A COLLEGE BUDDY
OF MINE.

04:43.283 --> 04:44.951
- THIS IS THE, UH, VIEW.

04:44.984 --> 04:46.453
- AWESOME.
- TAKE A LOOK.

04:46.486 --> 04:49.689
- HE PLEDGED THE FRATERNITY
THAT I WAS A MEMBER OF,

04:49.723 --> 04:51.858
AND I DON'T REMEMBER
BEING NICE TO HIM.

04:51.891 --> 04:53.126
- I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU
IN A WHILE. SIT DOWN.

04:53.159 --> 04:54.427
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

04:54.461 --> 04:55.628
I USED TO BEAT
THE [bleep] OUT OF HIM.

04:55.662 --> 04:56.996
SO WHAT'S GOING ON?
YOU DATING ANYBODY?

04:57.097 --> 04:58.965
- I AM, ACTUALLY.
I'M DATING A GREAT GIRL.

04:58.998 --> 05:00.567
- A GIRL? GOOD FOR YOU.
- A GIRL.

05:00.600 --> 05:02.369
- THAT'S GOOD. YOU DON'T
LOOK TOO MUCH OLDER.

05:02.402 --> 05:04.137
- YOU DO.
YOU'VE GRAYED A LITTLE BIT.

05:04.170 --> 05:06.840
- YOU'RE AN ASS[bleep].

05:06.873 --> 05:08.708
COLLEGE WAS TOTALLY DIFFERENT.
I HAD, LIKE, NO RESPONSIBILITY.

05:08.742 --> 05:11.144
I'D WAKE UP, WORK OUT--

05:11.177 --> 05:13.246
- HAZE SOME KIDS.
- YEAH.

05:13.279 --> 05:14.814
- I STILL REMEMBER.
- [laughs]

05:14.848 --> 05:16.449
- WELL, DO YOU WANT TO
TAKE A LOOK AROUND?

05:16.483 --> 05:18.251
- YEAH, UNLESS YOU WANT TO
START DOING PUSH-UPS.

05:18.284 --> 05:20.587
- ME?
- NO, THAT'S FINE. LET'S GO.

05:22.789 --> 05:25.859
MARK IS REPRESENTING
A RUSSIAN BUSINESSMAN

05:25.892 --> 05:27.794
WHO OWNS THE APARTMENT
AS AN INVESTMENT.

05:27.827 --> 05:29.629
- THIS IS THE MASTER BEDROOM.
- IT'S HUGE.

05:29.662 --> 05:33.533
- RIDICULOUS VIEW.
- THIS IS A PANTY-DROPPER.

05:33.566 --> 05:35.635
SO, IN THE SAME WAY THAT PEOPLE
HAVE INVESTMENT BANKERS

05:35.669 --> 05:37.904
TO MANAGE ALL OF THEIR
INVESTMENTS IN THE STOCK MARKET,

05:37.937 --> 05:41.608
MARK MANAGES ALL OF
HIS REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS.

05:41.641 --> 05:43.710
IF I SELL THIS
AND I DO A GOOD JOB,

05:43.743 --> 05:45.578
I WANT THAT WHOLE ACCOUNT.

05:45.612 --> 05:47.080
SO, I THINK, HONESTLY,

05:47.113 --> 05:48.815
THIS THING IS GOING TO SELL
TO SOMEONE OVERSEAS.

05:48.848 --> 05:51.284
I THINK IT'LL MOST LIKELY
SELL TO SOMEONE

05:51.317 --> 05:52.686
WHO WANTS TO USE IT
AS A PIED-A-TERRE.

05:52.719 --> 05:55.722
- SO WHAT DO YOU THINK
WE SHOULD PRICE THIS AT?

05:55.755 --> 06:00.527
- SO THE SAME APARTMENT TWO
FLOORS UP JUST LISTED FOR 6.6.

06:00.560 --> 06:02.495
NOW, THAT APARTMENT
WASN'T AS NICE AS THIS.

06:02.529 --> 06:03.863
- OKAY.

06:03.897 --> 06:05.031
- SO, BECAUSE THERE'S SUCH
LIMITED INVENTORY,

06:05.065 --> 06:06.633
I'D LIST IT
A LITTLE BIT HIGHER,

06:06.666 --> 06:08.368
LIKE AROUND 6.9.

06:08.401 --> 06:10.603
- 6.9?
- YEAH.

06:10.637 --> 06:13.139
- I WAS GONNA SAY 7.5.

06:13.173 --> 06:15.208
- 7.5 MILLION?
- YES.

06:15.241 --> 06:17.811
- SO, 600,000 MORE?
- YEAH.

06:17.844 --> 06:21.348
- IF YOU LOOK AT THE COMPS,
THESE APARTMENTS ARE NOW TRADING

06:21.381 --> 06:25.218
FOR ANYWHERE
FROM $6.5 TO $7 MILLION.

06:25.251 --> 06:27.287
- YOU DON'T THINK
YOU COULD SELL IT FOR 7.5?

06:27.320 --> 06:29.622
- NO. I MEAN,
I CAN SELL ANYTHING.

06:29.656 --> 06:31.458
I JUST THINK 7.5 IS
VERY EXPENSIVE, TO BE HONEST,

06:31.491 --> 06:33.460
SO THAT WE'RE NOT
WASTING OUR TIME.

06:33.493 --> 06:34.961
- BUT I THINK AN APARTMENT THIS
SIZE IS, YOU KNOW, AT LEAST,

06:35.061 --> 06:37.964
YOU KNOW,
IS IN THAT 7--7 TO 8 RANGE.

06:38.064 --> 06:39.366
- SURE. OKAY.

06:39.399 --> 06:40.367
- AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT
WE WANT TO SHOOT FOR.

06:40.400 --> 06:43.370
LET'S COMPROMISE.
7.45.

06:43.403 --> 06:44.471
IS THAT A GOOD COMPROMISE?

06:44.504 --> 06:46.406
- YOU'RE SUCH A ASS[bleep].

06:50.076 --> 06:51.911
MARK'S CLIENT
IS ASKING TOO MUCH,

06:51.945 --> 06:53.546
BUT I REALLY
WANT THIS LISTING,

06:53.580 --> 06:55.648
SO I'M GONNA
DO WHATEVER IT TAKES.

06:55.682 --> 06:56.649
YEAH, [bleep] IT.
LET'S DO IT.

06:56.683 --> 06:57.650
- IS THAT ALL RIGHT?
- 7.45.

06:57.684 --> 06:58.952
- YOU CAN DO IT?
- SURE.

06:58.985 --> 07:01.855
- BEFORE I SIGN ANYTHING,
LET'S DO SOMETHING.

07:01.888 --> 07:04.624
- ARE YOU SERIOUS?
- JUST TAKE OFF YOUR JACKET.

07:04.657 --> 07:07.160
LET'S DO A LITTLE EXPERIMENT.
- OKAY.

07:07.193 --> 07:09.062
- IS THAT OKAY?
- YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

07:09.095 --> 07:11.064
- SO, TAKE IT OFF.

07:11.097 --> 07:12.465
- [groans]
OH, MAN.

07:12.499 --> 07:14.267
- NOW LET'S DO
SOME WALL SITS.

07:14.300 --> 07:15.669
- MARK'S GOT SOME KIND OF
GRUDGE AGAINST ME,

07:15.702 --> 07:18.304
AND NOW HE'S JUST GONNA
BASICALLY TRY TO HUMILIATE ME

07:18.338 --> 07:19.806
THROUGHOUT THIS DEAL.

07:19.839 --> 07:21.041
MAYBE--
NOW I'M KIND OF AFRAID

07:21.074 --> 07:22.308
THAT HE MIGHT NOT EVEN
REALLY WANT TO SELL.

07:22.342 --> 07:23.710
THIS IS REALLY TO
SELL THIS APARTMENT?

07:23.743 --> 07:25.478
- I MEAN, YOU WANT ME TO SIGN
THIS PAPER, RIGHT?

07:25.512 --> 07:27.047
- YEAH.
- OKAY.

07:27.047 --> 07:28.348
DO YOU REMEMBER
HOW WE COUNTED?

07:28.381 --> 07:32.285
- SIR, ONE, SIR. SIR, TWO, SIR.
SIR, THREE, SIR.

07:32.318 --> 07:33.753
- GET A LITTLE LOWER.
90 DEGREES HERE.

07:33.787 --> 07:35.055
- OH, MAN.

07:35.088 --> 07:36.756
- WE'RE GONNA KEEP GOING
UNTIL WE GET TO 745.

07:36.790 --> 07:38.425
- SIR.
[laughs]

07:38.458 --> 07:40.927
I GET IT, I GET IT.

07:40.960 --> 07:43.596
I PLEDGED YOU. YOU'RE MAD.
I PUT YOU THROUGH HELL.

07:43.630 --> 07:44.864
BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH.

07:44.898 --> 07:46.232
I'VE NEVER HAD TO DO
WALL-SITS AND PUSH-UPS

07:46.266 --> 07:47.233
FOR A LISTING BEFORE.

07:47.267 --> 07:48.535
- YEAH, BUT I HAD TO DO IT

07:48.568 --> 07:50.270
TO GET THROUGH FRESHMAN YEAR
IN COLLEGE.

07:50.303 --> 07:53.873
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT?
- EVEN. DEAL? WE'RE EVEN NOW.

07:55.342 --> 07:57.577
- IT'S ALL YOURS.
- ALL RIGHT, GOOD.

07:57.610 --> 07:59.179
SO, I'LL HAVE MY ASSISTANT
SEND THIS BACK TO YOU.

07:59.212 --> 08:01.014
WE'LL BE GOOD TO GO.
- ALL RIGHT, MAN.

08:01.014 --> 08:02.115
IT WAS GOOD TO SEE YOU.
- GOOD TO SEE YOU.

08:02.148 --> 08:03.850
SO GLAD WE DID THIS.
- YEAH.

08:03.883 --> 08:06.720
- RIGHT.
- FOR OLD GOOD TIMES.

08:06.753 --> 08:10.023
[upbeat music]

08:10.023 --> 08:12.592
- SO WE MET FACE-TO-FACE
IN THIS WEIRD PLACE,

08:12.625 --> 08:14.027
UP ON A TERRACE,

08:14.027 --> 08:16.863
AND LIKE, HE STARTED TO GET
MORE AND MORE AGGRESSIVE.

08:16.896 --> 08:18.865
ANYWAY, LONG STORY SHORT,

08:18.898 --> 08:21.668
I POURED MY GREEN TEA

08:21.701 --> 08:24.537
OVER HIS FACE, HIS HEAD.

08:25.872 --> 08:27.240
- [laughs]

08:30.143 --> 08:33.446
ARE YOU BEING SERIOUS?
- AND THEN I--YEAH.

08:33.480 --> 08:34.781
I MEAN, HE WAS LIKE,
IN MY FACE,

08:34.814 --> 08:36.182
LIKE, REALLY--REALLY
AGGRESSIVE.

08:36.216 --> 08:38.585
AND I WROTE HIM A CHECK
FOR THE EVENT,

08:38.618 --> 08:41.454
AND HE WENT, LIKE, BANANAS.

08:41.488 --> 08:42.922
LIKE CUCKOO.

08:42.956 --> 08:45.725
- I-I CANNOT BELIEVE
YOU ACTUALLY DID THAT.

08:45.759 --> 08:47.460
- I DID MY JOB.
I SOLD THE APARTMENT.

08:47.494 --> 08:48.795
- I'M REALLY SURPRISED
AT YOU.

08:48.828 --> 08:50.096
- BABE, WAIT, YOU DON'T
UNDERSTAND THE STORY.

08:50.130 --> 08:51.831
I MEAN, HE WAS LIKE,
IN MY FACE,

08:51.865 --> 08:52.966
LIKE MORE AND MORE
AND MORE.

08:53.066 --> 08:54.801
I HAD IT WITH HIM.

08:54.834 --> 08:57.537
- IT'S CHILDISH.
I'M SORRY TO SAY THAT.

08:57.570 --> 09:00.306
- WELL, MAYBE
YOU SHOULD MARRY HIM.

09:00.340 --> 09:03.276
DO I REGRET IT? NO.

09:03.309 --> 09:04.744
HE WAS SCREAMING IN MY FACE,

09:04.778 --> 09:08.381
AND HE WAS SO--
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

09:08.415 --> 09:10.116
I DIDN'T TELL YOU
THE END OF THE STORY.

09:10.150 --> 09:11.584
- WHAT WAS THE END
OF THE STORY?

09:11.618 --> 09:15.055
- HE CASHED THE CHECK.

09:15.088 --> 09:17.290
HE DID. HE CASHED
THE FREAKING CHECK.

09:17.323 --> 09:21.861
AND THAT IS AFTER HE'S IN MY
FACE, QUESTIONING MY INTEGRITY,

09:21.895 --> 09:24.497
MY CHARACTER,
MY PROFESSIONALISM.

09:24.531 --> 09:26.900
CASHES IT.
WHO DOES THAT?

09:28.802 --> 09:30.770
YOU'RE NOT ANGRY AT ME,
ARE YOU?

09:30.804 --> 09:32.305
- I'M NOT ANGRY,
I'M JUST--I'M JUST--I'M JUST--

09:32.339 --> 09:33.640
- DO YOU WANT SOME GREEN TEA?

09:33.673 --> 09:35.542
- I'M KIND OF SHOCKED
AND SURPRISED.

09:35.575 --> 09:38.078
- GREEN TEA?
- [laughs]

09:38.111 --> 09:40.513
- I'M WARNING YOU.
WATCH OUT.

09:53.059 --> 09:56.930
- THE 50 LISPENARD STORY
SHOWS EVERY ANGLE OF MYSELF.

09:56.963 --> 09:59.566
SHOWS MY PASSION, MY HARD WORK,
MY WILLINGNESS,

09:59.599 --> 10:04.537
AND, UM, TO--TO--TO HAVE THIS
AS THE ENDING...

10:04.571 --> 10:06.606
I BLED FOR THIS THING,
AND I WANTED TO DO IT

10:06.639 --> 10:09.376
MORE THAN ANYBODY ELSE,
AND YOU [bleep] PLAY ME.

10:09.409 --> 10:11.077
THAT REALLY
BREAKS MY HEART,

10:11.111 --> 10:12.846
BECAUSE IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT
THE PIECE OF [bleep] GUY

10:12.879 --> 10:14.481
THAT FREDRIK IS RIGHT NOW.

10:14.514 --> 10:16.316
IT'S ABOUT THE FACT

10:16.349 --> 10:18.418
THAT I REALLY WANTED TO CLOSE
THE DEAL ON 50 LISPENARD.

10:18.451 --> 10:21.187
I TRIED SO HARD.

10:24.591 --> 10:27.594
THAT'S WHAT GET ME SO SAD.

10:34.668 --> 10:38.171
I REALLY WANT--I REALLY
WANTED TO MAKE A SALE THERE.

10:38.204 --> 10:40.840
SOME PEOPLE ARE IN LOVE
WITH PEOPLE.

10:40.874 --> 10:43.209
I FALL IN LOVE
WITH A BUILDING.

10:43.243 --> 10:46.579
AND I REALLY FELL IN LOVE.

10:46.613 --> 10:47.814
- COMING UP...

10:47.847 --> 10:49.449
- YOU HAVE TO BE REALISTIC
WHEN IT COMES TO PRICE.

10:49.482 --> 10:50.583
- I BELIEVE IT'S WORTH IT.

10:50.617 --> 10:52.218
YOU CAN'T GIVE CANDY AWAY
FOR FREE.

10:52.252 --> 10:54.254
YOU HAVE TO CHARGE FOR IT.

10:59.459 --> 11:02.429
[funky music]

11:02.462 --> 11:03.830

11:03.863 --> 11:05.365
- SAMMY?
- YES, SIR.

11:05.398 --> 11:08.268
- CAN YOU TAKE ME
TO 111 MERCER?

11:08.301 --> 11:10.203
DUE TO MY HUGE SUCCESS
ON LISPENARD STREET,

11:10.236 --> 11:12.872
I HAVE YET
ANOTHER BUILDING TO PITCH.

11:12.906 --> 11:17.277
I MEAN, WHAT CAN I SAY?
DING-DING-DING.

11:17.310 --> 11:19.312
I'M READY TO SET
A RECORD IN SOHO.

11:19.346 --> 11:21.514
PEOPLE LOVE SOHO
BECAUSE OF THE SHOPPING

11:21.548 --> 11:23.350
BUT ALSO BECAUSE
OF THE RESTAURANTS.

11:23.383 --> 11:26.086
111 MERCER IS NOT
JUST IN SOHO,

11:26.086 --> 11:28.855
IT'S BETWEEN
PRINCE AND SPRING,

11:28.888 --> 11:30.223
THE BEST ADDRESS
IN THE WORLD.

11:30.256 --> 11:32.258
OH, HEY, EDMUND,
HOW ARE YOU?

11:32.292 --> 11:33.760
- HEY.
- GOOD TO MEET YOU.

11:33.793 --> 11:35.962
- EDMUND LI.
- FREDRIK EKLUND.

11:35.995 --> 11:38.498
- EDMUND LI IS
A REPUTABLE DEVELOPER IN SOHO

11:38.531 --> 11:39.733
WITH A DOZEN BUILDINGS.

11:39.766 --> 11:41.501
- LET'S GO UP
TO THE FOURTH FLOOR.

11:41.534 --> 11:42.502
- OKAY.

11:42.535 --> 11:44.104
AND I WANT HIS BUSINESS.

11:44.104 --> 11:45.405
- SO THIS IS
A-A LOCKED BUILDING

11:45.438 --> 11:48.174
THAT WE ACQUIRED
ABOUT THREE YEARS AGO.

11:48.208 --> 11:49.909
IT'S ABOUT 125 YEARS OLD.

11:49.943 --> 11:51.378
- OH, MY GOD.
BEAUTIFUL.

11:53.113 --> 11:55.949
111 MERCER
IS A BOUTIQUE BUILDING,

11:55.982 --> 11:58.985
A BEAUTIFUL CAST-IRON FACADE.

11:59.019 --> 12:01.554
EACH FLOOR IS ITS OWN UNIT.

12:01.588 --> 12:03.523
THE ELEVATOR OPENS UP
INTO THE APARTMENT.

12:03.556 --> 12:05.058
LOOK AT THAT LIGHT.
BEAUTIFUL.

12:05.091 --> 12:07.060
REALLY HIGH CEILINGS.

12:07.093 --> 12:08.661
THE PERFECT PRODUCT
FOR SOHO.

12:08.695 --> 12:10.497
- THIS WILL BE WHERE
THE KITCHEN IS.

12:10.530 --> 12:12.632
- AND HAVE YOU PICKED
THE KITCHEN YET?

12:12.665 --> 12:14.701
- YEAH, PROBABLY
A EUROPEAN KITCHEN.

12:14.734 --> 12:16.302
- OKAY,
LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT.

12:18.405 --> 12:21.975
FREE-STANDING TUB?
- POSSIBLY.

12:22.075 --> 12:23.843
- I WOULD LIKE TO DESIGN
THE WHOLE BATHROOM AROUND THAT,

12:23.877 --> 12:25.645
BUT WE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT.

12:25.679 --> 12:26.980
LET ME ASK YOU, EDMUND.

12:27.080 --> 12:29.849
WHY HAVEN'T YOU PULLED
THE TRIGGER WITH A BROKER?

12:29.883 --> 12:31.084
- HAVEN'T HEARD ANYTHING

12:31.084 --> 12:33.553
THAT'S BEEN DIFFERENT
TO ANYBODY ELSE.

12:33.586 --> 12:35.522
- WHAT ARE THE PRICINGS
THEY'RE GIVING YOU?

12:35.555 --> 12:41.161
- THEY'VE BEEN TELLING ME,
YOU KNOW, BETWEEN 3.5 AND 3.75,

12:41.194 --> 12:43.196
BASING IT ON COMPS
THAT THEY'VE SHOWN ME.

12:43.229 --> 12:44.197
- YOU SEE,
THAT'S WHY I'M DIFFERENT.

12:44.230 --> 12:45.465
THE COMPS
ARE ALWAYS IMPORTANT,

12:45.498 --> 12:47.100
ESPECIALLY FOR BANKS,
WE ALL KNOW.

12:47.100 --> 12:50.103
BUT THE COMPS ARE THE PAST.

12:50.103 --> 12:51.438
I'M LIVING IN THE FUTURE,

12:51.471 --> 12:53.106
AND I WANT TO SET
A RECORD HERE.

12:53.139 --> 12:54.708
YOU HAVE--I CAN ONLY
CONGRATULATE YOU.

12:54.741 --> 12:56.976
YOU HAVE
THE MOST AMAZING SITE,

12:57.010 --> 12:58.645
AND YOU'VE DONE EVERYTHING RIGHT
WITH THE FLOOR PLAN.

12:58.678 --> 13:00.680
NOW IT'S ALL ABOUT
THE FINISHES.

13:00.714 --> 13:01.881
I WANT TO GET MY HANDS
REALLY DIRTY.

13:01.915 --> 13:03.049
I WANT TO PICK OUT
THE MATERIALS.

13:03.049 --> 13:04.050
I KNOW WHAT THE BUYERS WANT.

13:04.050 --> 13:05.185
I LOVE ARCHITECTS,

13:05.218 --> 13:07.420
BUT THEY DON'T KNOW
HOW BUYERS WANT TO LIVE.

13:07.454 --> 13:08.888
I'M IN TOUCH WITH THE BUYERS

13:08.922 --> 13:10.957
AND THEY'RE BECOMING
INCREASINGLY MORE SOPHISTICATED,

13:11.057 --> 13:13.660
AND SOME OF THESE DEVELOPERS
HAVE TO CATCH UP

13:13.693 --> 13:15.395
IF THEY'RE GONNA BE
AHEAD OF THE GAME,

13:15.428 --> 13:17.697
AHEAD OF THE MARKET,
AND GET RECORD PRICES.

13:17.731 --> 13:19.733
- SO WHAT DO YOU SUGGEST,
THEN?

13:19.766 --> 13:22.569
- I MEAN, I-I WOULD LIKE TO DO
SOME RESEARCH, COME BACK--

13:22.602 --> 13:24.337
LOOK AT SOME MATERIALS
AND COME BACK WITH YOU

13:24.371 --> 13:26.473
WITH A PROPOSAL
OF WHAT THIS IS GONNA COST.

13:26.506 --> 13:27.874
AND I KNOW YOU'RE PROBABLY
GONNA FREAK OUT,

13:27.907 --> 13:29.175
'CAUSE
IT'S GONNA BE EXPENSIVE.

13:29.209 --> 13:30.677
BUT THEN
WHEN I SHOW YOU THE PRICES

13:30.710 --> 13:32.679
THAT I'M GONNA BE ABLE
TO GET YOU,

13:32.712 --> 13:36.149
I THINK I CAN CONVINCE YOU.

13:36.182 --> 13:40.086
- I GUESS I COULD WAIT
BEFORE I HIRED THE AGENT.

13:40.086 --> 13:43.656
I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING
YOUR PROPOSAL. LET'S SEE.

13:43.690 --> 13:45.225
- IT'S A RISKY STRATEGY,
OF COURSE.

13:45.258 --> 13:48.628
I HAVE TO SPEND ALL THIS TIME,
AND I'M NOT EVEN GUARANTEED

13:48.661 --> 13:50.096
I'M GONNA GET THE LISTING
IN THE END.

13:50.130 --> 13:51.798
THIS MIGHT NOT PAN OUT.

13:51.831 --> 13:54.167
SO, CAN I TAKE THIS WITH ME
AND, YOU KNOW,

13:54.200 --> 13:56.169
THROW IT IN THE GARBAGE
ON THE WAY OUT?

13:56.202 --> 13:57.704
- [laughs]

13:59.239 --> 14:02.208
[funky music]

14:02.242 --> 14:04.444
* *

14:04.477 --> 14:07.213
- THE 50 LISPENARD STORY
REALLY BREAKS MY HEART,

14:07.247 --> 14:10.350
AND I STILL HAVE A LOT
OF HATRED FOR FREDRIK EKLUND.

14:10.383 --> 14:12.686
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
I HAVE TO MOVE ON.

14:12.719 --> 14:15.221
SO, I'M GOING TO PITCH
A NEW LISTING DOWNTOWN

14:15.255 --> 14:16.489
IN THE FINANCIAL DISTRICT.

14:16.523 --> 14:18.425
MOST OF THE APARTMENTS
IN THE FINANCIAL DISTRICT

14:18.458 --> 14:20.093
ARE STRAIGHT-UP HIGH-RISES

14:20.126 --> 14:21.561
THAT WERE CONVERTED
FROM OLD OFFICES,

14:21.594 --> 14:24.397
WITH ALL THE AMENITIES
FROM GYM, POOLS, DOORMEN.

14:24.431 --> 14:25.665
HEY, IT'S LUIS.

14:25.699 --> 14:27.734
[door buzzes]
THANK YOU.

14:27.767 --> 14:30.070
54 PINE STREET'S COMPLETELY
THE OPPOSITES OF ALL THAT.

14:30.070 --> 14:32.405
IT'S A VERY SIMPLE
FIVE-STORY BUILDING

14:32.439 --> 14:34.240
THAT HAD NO AMENITIES
WHATSOEVER.

14:34.274 --> 14:36.943
THIS IS THE KIND OF PLACE
THAT YOU FIND IN SOHO,

14:36.976 --> 14:38.511
WEST VILLAGE, OR TRIBECA.

14:38.545 --> 14:41.381
HELLO.
- HI. LUIS?

14:41.414 --> 14:42.482
- HOW ARE YOU? LUIS.
NICE TO MEET YOU.

14:42.515 --> 14:43.650
- MARI.
NICE TO MEET YOU.

14:43.683 --> 14:45.118
- THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.

14:45.151 --> 14:46.953
I LIKE THE FACT THAT IT'S ONLY
ONE APARTMENT PER FLOOR.

14:46.986 --> 14:48.154
THAT'S NICE TO SEE.
- YES.

14:48.188 --> 14:49.923
- I GET A LOT OF REFERRALS
FROM PUERTO RICO,

14:49.956 --> 14:51.391
AND MARI'S PARENTS

14:51.424 --> 14:54.461
OWN THE BIGGEST CAR DEALERSHIPS
IN PUERTO RICO.

14:54.494 --> 14:56.429
- THIS IS THE LIVING ROOM.
- OH, WOW.

14:56.463 --> 14:57.630
- YEAH.

14:57.664 --> 15:00.633
[upbeat music]

15:00.667 --> 15:06.039
* *

15:06.039 --> 15:07.273
SO, THIS IS THE KITCHEN AREA.

15:07.307 --> 15:10.043
- IT'S A SMALL KITCHEN.
- YEAH, YEAH.

15:10.043 --> 15:12.245
- I'M ASSUMING THEY HAVEN'T
ACTUALLY RENOVATED ANYTHING.

15:12.278 --> 15:13.947
- NO, NO.
- THEY JUST BOUGHT IT AS IS.

15:14.047 --> 15:16.383
- AS IS. YEAH.
- OKAY.

15:27.861 --> 15:29.896
- SO, BASICALLY,

15:29.929 --> 15:33.400
MY PARENTS BOUGHT THIS IN 2006
AS AN INVESTMENT.

15:33.433 --> 15:34.734
- SO, AT THE HEIGHT
OF THE MARKET?

15:34.768 --> 15:36.870
- YES.
- HOW MUCH DID YOU PAY?

15:36.903 --> 15:38.438
- 1.1.
- 1.1.

15:38.471 --> 15:39.839
AND WHAT
ARE YOUR EXPECTATIONS

15:39.873 --> 15:42.108
AS FAR AS THE PRICE
YOU WANT TO GET FOR IT?

15:42.142 --> 15:45.278
- WE'RE THINKING 1.5.
- 1.5.

15:45.311 --> 15:47.247
THAT'S--THAT'S
A LITTLE BIT HIGH.

15:47.280 --> 15:49.315
- WELL, I'M LOOKING FOR SOMEBODY
WHO'S GONNA MAKE IT HAPPEN,

15:49.349 --> 15:52.218
SO IF YOU THINK YOU'RE NOT GONNA
BE THE ONE, THEN WE'LL--

15:52.252 --> 15:53.720
- WELL, I AM ABLE TO MAKE
ANYTHING HAPPEN,

15:53.753 --> 15:55.155
AND THAT'S WHAT I DO.

15:55.188 --> 15:57.724
BUT YOU HAVE TO BE REALISTIC
WHEN IT COMES TO PRICE,

15:57.757 --> 16:00.660
BECAUSE IF YOU--
IF YOU BOUGHT IT IN 2006,

16:00.694 --> 16:01.695
THAT WAS THE HEIGHT
OF THE MARKET.

16:01.728 --> 16:03.797
THEN YOU HAD THE MARKET CRASH
IN 2008.

16:03.830 --> 16:04.898
EVERYTHING
STARTED TO GO DOWN,

16:04.931 --> 16:06.232
ESPECIALLY
IN THE FINANCIAL DISTRICT,

16:06.266 --> 16:08.768
AND NOW YOU HAVE
ALL THESE NEW DEVELOPMENTS

16:08.802 --> 16:11.104
BUILDING AROUND YOU
WITH FULL-SERVICE DOORMEN,

16:11.137 --> 16:13.039
24-HOUR DOORMAN BUILDINGS.

16:13.039 --> 16:14.874
SO FOR THIS KIND
OF APARTMENTS,

16:14.908 --> 16:18.311
I WOULD SAY
NO MORE THAN $850 A FOOT.

16:18.345 --> 16:21.514
JUST ABOUT 1.3.
- 1.3 MILLION?

16:21.548 --> 16:24.417
MY FAMILY AND I KNOW ABOUT
NEW YORK AND ITS REAL ESTATE,

16:24.451 --> 16:27.921
AND WE UNDERSTAND
THAT SPACE IS GOLD IN NEW YORK.

16:27.954 --> 16:31.057
AND AN APARTMENT WITH THIS
SPACE, I BELIEVE IT'S WORTH IT.

16:31.057 --> 16:33.693
I MEAN, YOU CAN'T GIVE CANDY
AWAY FOR FREE.

16:33.727 --> 16:35.261
YOU HAVE TO CHARGE FOR IT.

16:35.295 --> 16:37.530
- LISTEN, THE REASON PEOPLE COME
DOWN TO THE FINANCIAL DISTRICT,

16:37.564 --> 16:40.400
IT'S IN SEARCH FOR THESE
LUXURY DOORMAN BUILDINGS.

16:40.433 --> 16:42.936
THIS KIND OF APARTMENT
IN THE WEST VILLAGE,

16:42.969 --> 16:45.071
$2.5 MILLION EASILY.

16:45.105 --> 16:47.440
BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT PEOPLE
IN THE WEST VILLAGE LIKE.

16:47.474 --> 16:50.176
SO, I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING.

16:50.210 --> 16:52.946
IF YOU WANT, I'LL OVEREXTEND
MYSELF A LITTLE BIT,

16:52.979 --> 16:55.548
AND I'LL PUT IT
ON THE MARKET FOR 1.35.

16:55.582 --> 16:57.283
YOU'RE STILL
COMING OUT STRONG.

16:57.317 --> 16:58.318
THINK ABOUT IT.

16:58.351 --> 17:00.186
MOST PEOPLE
THAT BOUGHT IN 2006

17:00.220 --> 17:02.822
IN THE HEIGHT OF THE MARKET
ARE LOSING.

17:02.856 --> 17:08.261
SO, 1.35, I'LL TAKE THIS THING,
AND I PROMISE TO YOU

17:08.294 --> 17:10.563
THAT I WILL SELL THIS
LIKE NO GODDAMN TOMORROW.

17:10.597 --> 17:12.866
BUT YOU CAN'T NOT HIRE
A PUERTO RICAN.

17:12.899 --> 17:15.935
YOU CANNOT.
I MEAN, IT'S BAD KARMA.

17:16.036 --> 17:18.371
- UM, WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?

17:18.405 --> 17:21.107
I DEFINITELY RESPECT
YOUR HONESTY,

17:21.141 --> 17:24.678
SO I THINK WE'RE GONNA
GO AHEAD AND DO THE DEAL.

17:24.711 --> 17:26.279
- BEAUTIFUL.

17:26.312 --> 17:28.214
- BUT MIND YOU, IT'S NOT
BECAUSE YOU'RE PUERTO RICAN.

17:28.248 --> 17:30.684
AND MIND YOU,
MY DAD IS PUERTO RICAN,

17:30.717 --> 17:32.185
SO YOU BETTER
GET THIS DEAL.

17:32.218 --> 17:33.753
- I CAN GUARANTEE YOU

17:33.787 --> 17:35.155
THAT I WILL WORK
LIKE A GODDAMN CHAMPION

17:35.188 --> 17:36.523
TO MAKE SURE
THAT THIS IS SOLD.

17:36.556 --> 17:39.059
- WELL, LET'S SEE
IF YOU PROVE YOURSELF.

17:39.059 --> 17:40.460
- ALL RIGHT.

17:40.493 --> 17:43.463
[upbeat music]

17:46.499 --> 17:48.702
-<i>SALUD. SALUD.</i>

17:48.735 --> 17:50.170
HOW DO I DO IT IN
[bleep] RUSSIAN?

17:50.203 --> 17:54.274
ONE BEACON COURT IS
AN INTERNATIONAL BUILDING,

17:54.307 --> 17:56.876
AND MOST LIKELY, THE PERSON
THAT BUYS THIS APARTMENT

17:56.910 --> 17:59.112
IS NOT GOING TO BE
FROM THE UNITED STATES.

17:59.145 --> 18:00.113
<i>KONNICHIWA.</i>

18:00.146 --> 18:01.414
SO, MY STRATEGY

18:01.448 --> 18:05.018
IS TO INVITE EVERY
INTERNATIONAL BROKER I KNOW

18:05.051 --> 18:06.753
AND KIND OF PUT 'EM TOGETHER
IN A ROOM

18:06.786 --> 18:07.854
TO KIND OF MAKE IT FUN.

18:07.887 --> 18:09.456
HELLO.
- YO.

18:09.489 --> 18:12.058
SO I GOT TRANSLATORS
WHO SPEAK SPANISH, FRENCH,

18:12.092 --> 18:14.127
RUSSIAN, HEBREW, MANDARIN.

18:14.160 --> 18:15.895
SO PEOPLE ARE GONNA
START COMING UPSTAIRS,

18:15.929 --> 18:17.197
AND AS THEY COME IN,
I'LL FIGURE OUT, KIND OF,

18:17.230 --> 18:18.231
WHAT LANGUAGE THEY ARE.

18:18.264 --> 18:19.632
BASICALLY,
I'M LIKE A DIPLOMAT

18:19.666 --> 18:21.901
HOSTING A SUMMIT
AT THE UNITED NATIONS,

18:21.935 --> 18:24.838

AT MY OPEN HOUSE.

19:01.408 --> 19:02.776
WHERE'S YOUR TRANSLATOR?

19:02.809 --> 19:04.411
IT SEEMS LIKE EVERYONE'S
A GREAT TIME,

19:04.444 --> 19:06.212
BUT I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT'S GOING ON.

19:06.246 --> 19:07.247
[speaking French]

19:07.280 --> 19:08.448
OH, NO, THAT'S FRENCH.
- OH!

19:08.481 --> 19:10.350
- I GET SO CONFUSED
IN THIS ROOM.

19:10.383 --> 19:11.685
I HAD NO IDEA WHAT
ANYONE WAS TALKING ABOUT.

19:11.718 --> 19:13.520
IT'S LIKE BEING IN A ROOM
FULL OF EX-GIRLFRIENDS.

19:13.553 --> 19:18.692
HOW DO I SAY, "DO YOU--DO YOU
WANT TO MAKE AN OFFER?"

19:18.725 --> 19:20.727
[both speaking foreign language]

19:20.760 --> 19:22.495

21:04.297 --> 21:06.066
MM-MM-MM.
I DON'T LIKE THAT.

21:06.066 --> 21:07.834

BUT MAYBE A LITTLE TOO DARK.

WANT TO BE DEPRESSED

21:09.135 --> 21:11.438

DEFINITELY NOT.

21:19.746 --> 21:21.181
THESE ARE BIG DECISIONS,

21:21.214 --> 21:23.583
I KNOW IT'S GONNA
BE EXPENSIVE,

21:23.616 --> 21:26.386
BUT THESE FINISHES NEED TO BE
ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS.

21:26.419 --> 21:29.389
'CAUSE IF I DON'T LOVE THEM,
WHAT ARE THE BUYERS GONNA THINK?

21:29.422 --> 21:30.990

21:46.106 --> 21:48.508
ON AN ENTIRE WALL IN A BATHROOM,
HOW BEAUTIFUL THAT WOULD BE.

21:48.541 --> 21:49.776
HOW MUCH IS THIS?

21:49.809 --> 21:53.813

I NEED TO CALCULATE.
THAT'S GONNA BE EXPENSIVE.

21:56.616 --> 21:58.118
THAT'S--'CAUSE THE BATHROOMS
ARE LARGE,

21:58.118 --> 21:59.619
BUT IT'S EXACTLY
WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR.

21:59.652 --> 22:02.655
IT'S VERY SOHO.
WE'RE ON OUR WAY.

22:02.689 --> 22:06.826

23:24.504 --> 23:26.840
- HOWEVER, I NEED TO
DISTRACT PEOPLE,

23:26.873 --> 23:28.808
JUST BECAUSE OF THE FACT
THAT I HAVE NO DOORMAN,

23:28.842 --> 23:30.110
NO AMENITIES WHATSOEVER.

23:30.143 --> 23:31.144
RIGHT.

23:31.177 --> 23:32.779
AND FOCUS ON THE CHARACTER.

23:32.812 --> 23:34.247

- I DIDN'T NOTICE. IS THERE
AN INTERCOM DOWNSTAIRS?

24:09.883 --> 24:12.318
- THERE IS AN INTERCOM ON
THE DOOR, SO YOU--YOU CAN SEE

24:12.352 --> 24:13.920
THE PERSON
THAT'S ACTUALLY BUZZING IN.

24:13.953 --> 24:15.655

- NEAREST PARKING GARAGE
IS ON LIBERTY STREET.

24:27.200 --> 24:28.835
LET ME SHOW YOU
THE KITCHEN.

24:28.868 --> 24:30.603
RIGHT HERE, YOU HAVE
A BREAKFAST BAR.

24:30.637 --> 24:32.539
IT LOOKS BEAUTIFUL.
IT'S GOOD FOR ENTERTAINING.

24:32.572 --> 24:35.575
- KITCHEN IS A LITTLE SMALL.
- IT IS.

24:35.608 --> 24:37.444
IT'S NOT AS OPEN
AS I THINK IT SHOULD BE.

24:37.477 --> 24:39.079
- I ALREADY KNEW
THERE WAS AN ISSUE

24:39.112 --> 24:41.081
WITH THE LACK OF AMENITIES
IN THIS BUILDING,

24:41.081 --> 24:43.316
BUT NOW THEY'RE CONFIRMING
ONE OF MY BIGGEST FEARS.

24:43.350 --> 24:44.818
THEY DON'T LIKE
THE KITCHEN.

24:44.851 --> 24:47.253
AND KITCHENS ARE
VERY EXPENSIVE TO REMODEL.

24:47.287 --> 24:48.922
AND THE GOOD THING ABOUT IT,

24:48.955 --> 24:50.290
AND THIS WHY I'M SO EXCITED
ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR APARTMENT,

24:50.323 --> 24:53.593
IS THIS IS PRICED A LITTLE BIT
ABOVE $800 A FOOT.

24:53.626 --> 24:56.329
- IT'S A LITTLE HIGH,
ISN'T IT?

24:56.363 --> 24:58.231
- I THINK THIS HAS
MUCH MORE CHARACTER

24:58.264 --> 25:00.333
THAN ANY OTHER
NEW DEVELOPMENTS OUT THERE.

25:03.036 --> 25:06.039
- EVERYBODY
FELT EXACTLY THE SAME WAY.

25:06.039 --> 25:08.742
THEY ALL THINK THIS APARTMENT
IS PRICED TOO HIGH.

25:08.775 --> 25:10.110
THANK YOU, GUYS.

25:10.143 --> 25:12.912
AND THAT IS NOT SOMETHING
ANY OWNER WANTS TO HEAR.

25:17.384 --> 25:21.888

25:21.921 --> 25:24.057
- AFTER SHOPPING
FOR FINISHES,

25:24.090 --> 25:27.761
I'M NOW READY TO SIT DOWN WITH
EDMUND TO PRESENT MY VISION

25:27.794 --> 25:30.830
AND MAKE HIM UNDERSTAND
HOW IT'S GONNA BENEFIT HIM

25:30.864 --> 25:31.965
IF HE PICKS ME
AS HIS BROKER.

25:32.065 --> 25:33.066
- HEY, FREDRIK.
- HOW ARE YOU?

25:33.066 --> 25:34.567
THIS IS HUGE.

25:34.601 --> 25:36.169
A WHOLE BUILDING'S
ON THE LINE HERE.

25:36.202 --> 25:39.939
YOU KNOW, SINCE WE MET LAST,
I'VE PICKED OUT SOME FINISHES

25:39.973 --> 25:42.075
THAT'S GONNA WORK
REALLY WELL IN THIS MARKET.

25:42.075 --> 25:43.843
- LET'S SEE
WHAT YOU'VE CHOSEN.

25:43.877 --> 25:45.612
- WELL, LET'S START WITH
THE LEAST EXPENSIVE ITEM.

25:45.645 --> 25:48.648
IT'S A $10,000 TUB.

25:48.682 --> 25:51.951
THE SHAPE, THE STYLE,
THE CRAFTSMANSHIP.

25:51.985 --> 25:54.320
IT'S AUTHENTIC.
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

25:54.354 --> 25:56.556
- YOU REALLY--
- WAIT, THERE'S MORE.

25:56.589 --> 26:01.394
THE TILE, MASTER, HAS THAT
PERFECT BLEND OF OLD AND NEW.

26:01.428 --> 26:04.130
A BRICK,
JUST LIKE SOHO ITSELF.

26:04.164 --> 26:06.433
POWDER AND SECOND BATH.

26:08.201 --> 26:12.105
$30,000 PER UNIT.

26:13.340 --> 26:16.476
EVERYONE UNDER THE SUN
HAS PITCHED TO THIS GUY,

26:16.509 --> 26:18.144
AND THEY'RE ALL
COMING IN TOO LOW.

26:18.178 --> 26:21.181
THE FIXTURES
AND THE COUNTERTOPS.

26:21.214 --> 26:24.584
THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY EDMUND
IS GONNA GET THE HIGHEST PRICE.

26:24.617 --> 26:29.356
HE NEEDS TO COMPLETE THIS
BUILDING TO 125% PERFECTION.

26:29.389 --> 26:31.458
EKLUND PERFECTION.

26:31.491 --> 26:34.361
ALL-IN-ALL, $100,000.

26:34.394 --> 26:37.931
- PER UNIT?
- PER UNIT.

26:37.964 --> 26:39.299
- ARE YOU CRAZY?
- NO.

26:39.332 --> 26:40.734
SO WHAT I DID,
BECAUSE I'VE BEEN CALLED CRAZY

26:40.767 --> 26:42.302
MANY TIMES BEFORE,
ESPECIALLY CRAZY GOOD

26:42.335 --> 26:43.770
WHEN I SELL
AT RECORD PRICES,

26:43.803 --> 26:48.174
I SPENT QUITE A BIT OF MY OWN
MONEY TO RENDER THIS BATHROOM,

26:48.208 --> 26:51.945
WITH THESE FINISHES,
IN A COMPUTER.

26:51.978 --> 26:55.281
ALMOST WANT TO TOUCH IT.
THE WHITE GLAZED BRICK.

26:55.315 --> 26:57.083
THE DARK WOOD.
LOOK HOW BEAUTIFUL.

26:57.117 --> 27:00.687
THAT'S EXACTLY WHERE
THE MARKET IS HEADING.

27:00.720 --> 27:03.823
- IT DOES LOOK GOOD, BUT--
- ONE MORE.

27:03.857 --> 27:05.725
I DIDN'T WANT TO
EXAGGERATE ANYTHING.

27:05.759 --> 27:09.629
THE REAL HEIGHT,
THE WIDTH OF THIS LIVING ROOM.

27:09.662 --> 27:12.399
I MEAN, CAN YOU IMAGINE
LIVING LIKE THIS?

27:12.432 --> 27:13.833
WE TALKED ABOUT
THE COUNTER TOP.

27:13.867 --> 27:15.468
I REALLY WANT
THAT MARBLE IN THERE.

27:15.502 --> 27:18.204
- THIS IS REALLY
TAKING A LOT OF FINISHES

27:18.238 --> 27:20.140
THAT ARE UNUSUAL
FOR A SOHO LOFT.

27:20.173 --> 27:22.375
YOU FEEL THAT'S NOT
TOO SPECIFIC FOR THE BUYER?

27:22.409 --> 27:24.644
- NO.
WE ONLY HAVE FOUR UNITS.

27:24.678 --> 27:26.246
WE NEED TO BE A BIT SPECIFIC.

27:26.279 --> 27:28.848
IT'S AUTHENTIC,
IT'S INNOVATIVE, IT'S PERFECT.

27:28.882 --> 27:31.584
LISTEN, THIS IS
THE POINT OF THIS MEETING.

27:31.618 --> 27:34.354
YOU TOLD ME THE OTHER BROKERS
HAVE QUOTED YOU PRICES

27:34.387 --> 27:38.124
FOR THESE UNITS,
FOR 3.5, 3.7, 3.7,50.

27:38.158 --> 27:41.828
I BELIEVE THAT IF YOU GO AHEAD
WITH ALL OF THIS, HIRE ME,

27:41.861 --> 27:46.332
I WILL SELL FOR
$4.4 MILLION EACH.

27:46.366 --> 27:49.202
- 4.4?
- YES.

27:51.805 --> 27:56.743
- YOU'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO
GET ME $700,000 MORE PER UNIT

27:56.776 --> 27:58.545
BECAUSE OF THESE UPGRADES?

27:58.578 --> 28:00.013
- AND A LOT OF WORK,
AND A REALLY GOOD BROKER.

28:00.046 --> 28:02.015
THAT'S CORRECT.

28:07.087 --> 28:10.323
- YOU HAVE TO GUARANTEE ME THAT
YOU'LL GET ME THOSE NUMBERS.

28:10.357 --> 28:12.559
- I GUARANTEE IT TO YOU.

28:16.129 --> 28:17.330
- I'M GONNA HAVE TO
HOLD YOU TO IT.

28:17.364 --> 28:19.799
- PLEASE DO.
4.4 MILLION.

28:19.833 --> 28:23.370
I'LL SEND AN AGREEMENT
AND THE LIST OF UPGRADES.

28:23.403 --> 28:26.940
$100,000 PER UNIT.
LET'S GET STARTED.

[upbeat music]

28:30.043 --> 28:36.216

28:36.249 --> 28:39.352
- MY INTERNATIONAL BROKERS
OPEN HOUSE WAS A SUCCESS,

28:39.386 --> 28:40.920
AND IT'S BEEN ONLY ONE WEEK,

28:40.954 --> 28:43.623
AND SERGEI, ONE OF
THE RUSSIAN BROKERS WHO CAME,

28:43.656 --> 28:45.658
HAS ALREADY CALLED ME
AND ASKED ME TO MEET HIM.

28:45.692 --> 28:47.594
AND I HOPE
HE'S GOT GOOD NEWS.

28:47.627 --> 28:48.661
- HEY, RYAN.
- SERGEI.

28:48.695 --> 28:50.430
- GOOD TO SEE YOU.
- GOOD TO SEE YOU.

28:50.463 --> 28:52.365
HAVE A SEAT.
SO WHAT'S GOING ON?

28:52.399 --> 28:53.967
DO YOU WANT TO ORDER,
OR YOU WANT TO--

28:54.067 --> 28:55.402
- I'M FINE.
I DON'T WANT TO EAT.

28:55.435 --> 28:56.870
I'M ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW,
I'M SHORT ON TIME.

28:56.903 --> 29:00.740
- SO--SO WHAT'S GOING ON?
YOU--YOU HAVE AN OFFER OR--

29:00.774 --> 29:02.876
- YES, I DID SPEAK
WITH MY CLIENT,

29:02.909 --> 29:08.314
AND WHAT SHE TOLD ME
THAT WE CAN OFFER, 6.6.

29:11.718 --> 29:13.253
WHY ARE YOU SMILING?

29:13.286 --> 29:15.889
- CAN'T.
CAN'T DO 6.6.

29:15.922 --> 29:19.926
IT'S ALMOST $1 MILLION OFF
OF WHERE WE CURRENTLY ARE.

29:20.026 --> 29:22.495
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY
YOU'RE WASTING MY TIME WITH 6.6.

29:22.529 --> 29:23.830
IT'S TOTALLY RIDICULOUS.

29:23.863 --> 29:26.299
- YOU KNOW, MY BUYER,
SHE IS FROM MOSCOW,

29:26.332 --> 29:28.601
AND SHE LIVES
A VERY LUXURIOUS LIFESTYLE.

29:28.635 --> 29:30.203
- SURE.

29:30.236 --> 29:32.038
- AND THERE IS NOTHING
REMARKABLE ABOUT YOUR APARTMENT.

29:32.038 --> 29:34.240
- WELL, IT'S NEVER BEEN
LIVED IN, RIGHT?

29:34.274 --> 29:37.043
HE RENOVATED IT,
HE REDID THE FLOORS.

29:37.043 --> 29:40.213
- WE'D HAVE TO BRING A LOT
OF UPGRADES FOR MY CLIENT

29:40.246 --> 29:41.681
TO REALLY LOVE IT.

29:41.715 --> 29:43.416
- LOOK, I UNDERSTAND THAT SHE
WANTS SOMETHING NICER,

29:43.450 --> 29:47.721
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY,
I-I DON'T GIVE A [bleep].

29:47.754 --> 29:50.757
AND MY SELLER
ISN'T GONNA GIVE A [bleep].

29:50.790 --> 29:53.293
BUT I'M GOING TO CALL HIM,

29:53.326 --> 29:56.162
AND I AM GOING TO SEE
WHAT I CAN DO,

29:56.196 --> 29:57.797
BECAUSE I WANT TO
GET THE DEAL DONE.

29:57.831 --> 29:59.599
- OKAY, SOUNDS GOOD.
PLEASE GET BACK TO ME.

29:59.632 --> 30:01.301
- YEAH, OKAY.

30:03.370 --> 30:07.007

HAPPY ABOUT THIS.

30:07.040 --> 30:10.543
- HEY, MARK. HOW YOU DOING?
- I'M GOOD.

30:10.577 --> 30:14.814
- SO I AM WITH A BROKER
WHO CAME TO THE OPEN HOUSE,

30:14.848 --> 30:20.920
AND HE'S MAKING AN OFFER,
BUT THEIR OFFER IS LOW.

30:20.954 --> 30:24.057
- IT'S 6.6.

30:33.066 --> 30:36.102
- I--DUDE, I AM MANNING UP.

30:36.136 --> 30:38.338
HE'S--I MEAN, I'M LIKE,
IN THE--

30:41.841 --> 30:43.410
- YEAH, OKAY.
I'LL CALL YOU BACK.

30:43.443 --> 30:44.577
LET ME SEE WHAT I CAN DO.

30:44.611 --> 30:47.113

30:47.147 --> 30:48.515
PERFECT.

30:48.548 --> 30:49.883
I CAN WORK WITH 7 MILLION,

30:49.916 --> 30:52.185
BUT IN ORDER TO GET SERGEI
TO COME UP TO THAT NUMBER,

30:52.218 --> 30:54.287
I GOT TO PLAY THIS
THE RIGHT WAY.

30:54.320 --> 30:55.422
OH.

30:55.455 --> 30:57.223
- TALK TO ME, RYAN.

30:57.257 --> 30:59.959

HAS A LITTLE BIT OF WRONG IN IT.

31:00.060 --> 31:01.494
I SPOKE TO HIM.
- ALL RIGHT.

- AND THIS HOW
WE'RE GONNA DO THIS.

31:02.529 --> 31:04.664
I'M GONNA BE REAGAN, OKAY?

31:05.765 --> 31:07.167
AND WE'RE GONNA
GET THIS DEAL DONE.

31:07.200 --> 31:08.968
- SO LET'S COMPROMISE, YES?

31:09.069 --> 31:10.103
- IT'S ALL ABOUT
COMPROMISE.

31:10.136 --> 31:13.473
THEY'RE COMING DOWN
$200,000.

31:13.506 --> 31:16.076
SO THEIR COUNTER
IS $7,250,000.

31:16.076 --> 31:18.178
- RYAN,
THIS IS NOT A COMPROMISE.

31:18.211 --> 31:19.813

A--TAKE IT OUT FOR A SPIN?

DON'T KNOW ABOUT ME

32:12.632 --> 32:16.136
IS THAT I USED TO BE
A CHAMPION SKATEBOARDER.

32:16.169 --> 32:17.937

AND SINCE THAT DAY, I SKATED
FOR NINE YEARS STRAIGHT,

32:34.888 --> 32:36.690
EVERY SINGLE DAY.

32:36.723 --> 32:38.758
I'M BACK.

34:28.668 --> 34:31.805
- OKAY, ARPAD, COME HERE.
OOH.

34:31.838 --> 34:33.840
UNFORTUNATELY, I CAN'T WAIT
FOR THE UNITS TO BE FINISHED.

34:33.873 --> 34:35.575
I DON'T HAVE THAT TIME.

34:35.608 --> 34:37.777
EDMUND WANTS ME
TO BE SOLD OUT YESTERDAY.

34:37.811 --> 34:39.646
ARPAD, YOU HAVE TO HELP ME.
- OKAY.

34:39.679 --> 34:41.614
- THE BROKERS ARE ARRIVING
IN JUST A FEW MINUTES.

34:41.648 --> 34:44.551
SO, TODAY I'M BRINGING
THE ARCHITECT, ARPAD,

34:44.584 --> 34:47.954
TO MY OPEN HOUSE TO MAKE
THE BROKERS FEEL MORE SPECIAL.

34:47.987 --> 34:51.591
BUT THE TRUE SELLING POINT HERE
IS, OF COURSE, MY FINISHES.

34:51.624 --> 34:54.728
AND TODAY, PEOPLE,
IS THE GRAND UNVEILING.

34:54.761 --> 34:57.731
[upbeat music]

34:57.764 --> 35:02.635
* *

35:02.669 --> 35:04.904
I GOT THE FINISHES
ON A RUSH ORDER,

35:04.938 --> 35:07.040
AND I GOT THEM INSTALLED
SUPER FAST.

35:07.040 --> 35:10.210
WE HAVE TO SHOW
THE KITCHEN.

35:12.412 --> 35:14.581
HURRY, HURRY, HURRY, HURRY.
OH, THAT'S BEAUTIFUL.

35:14.614 --> 35:15.915
THE MARBLE. THAT'S STUNNING.
LOOK AT THAT.

35:15.949 --> 35:17.817
LOOK AT THE VEINS HERE,
HOW BEAUTIFUL THAT IS.

35:17.851 --> 35:19.052
NOW WE'RE UP TO, LIKE,
2 MILLION.

35:19.052 --> 35:21.054
I NEED TO GO TO
4.4 MILLION.

35:21.054 --> 35:23.056
I JUST REALLY WANT TO
SHOW THE BOOKCASE THERE,

35:23.056 --> 35:24.157
HOW BEAUTIFUL THAT IS.

35:24.190 --> 35:25.458
THE MESS IS FAR FROM IDEAL.

35:25.492 --> 35:26.726
AH!

35:26.760 --> 35:29.863
THE GOAL IS, OF COURSE,
TO HAVE BROKERS LOOK PAST THIS,

35:29.896 --> 35:32.599
AND I'M REALLY HOPING
THAT THE BROKERS CAN.

35:32.632 --> 35:35.201
- [groans]

35:35.235 --> 35:36.436
[doorbell rings]

35:36.469 --> 35:38.705
- HI, LOVE. MWAH.
- HI. MWAH.

35:38.738 --> 35:40.774
- HI, WELCOME TO 111 MERCER.
- THANKS.

35:40.807 --> 35:42.208
both: MWAH, MWAH.

35:42.242 --> 35:44.477
- WELCOME.
MWAH, MWAH.

35:44.511 --> 35:45.779
EVERYBODY WELCOME.

35:45.812 --> 35:47.714
I DO APOLOGIZE FOR THE DUST

35:47.747 --> 35:52.218
AND THE UGLINESS
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM.

35:52.252 --> 35:54.721
SO WE HAVE FOUR UNITS.

35:54.754 --> 35:56.523
THIS IS THE SECOND FLOOR.
THE WINDOWS ARE GREAT.

35:56.556 --> 35:57.857
THE BUILDING IS LANDMARKED,

35:57.891 --> 36:00.727
AND WE'VE BEEN HANDPICKING
A LOT OF THESE FINISHES,

36:00.760 --> 36:02.896
AND I FEEL THAT WE DID
A REALLY GOOD JOB,

36:02.929 --> 36:04.497
A BALANCE
OF THE OLD AND THE NEW.

36:04.531 --> 36:05.799
- HOW MANY SQUARE FEET?

36:05.832 --> 36:09.202
- 2,024,
WHICH IS HUGE FOR SOHO.

36:09.235 --> 36:11.738
4.4 MILLION.
NOT NEGOTIABLE.

36:11.771 --> 36:13.940
- OVER $2,000
A SQUARE FOOT?

36:14.040 --> 36:15.575
- $2,200,
TO BE EXACT, YES.

36:15.608 --> 36:17.043
- I THINK, IN MY APPRAISAL,

36:17.077 --> 36:18.144
IT MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIT HIGH
FOR WHAT YOU'RE SELLING.

36:18.178 --> 36:19.479
- IT'S A REAL CONDOMINIUM
IN SOHO.

36:19.512 --> 36:20.480
JUST BEAUTIFUL FINISHES.

36:20.513 --> 36:21.681
- I THINK IT'S BEAUTIFUL,

36:21.715 --> 36:24.250
BUT I THINK
IT'S A LITTLE EXPENSIVE.

36:24.284 --> 36:27.454
- WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M GONNA PROVE YOU WRONG.

36:27.487 --> 36:29.456
- I HOPE YOU DO,
AND I'M SURE YOU WILL.

36:29.489 --> 36:30.590
[laughter]

36:30.623 --> 36:32.292
- AT $4.4 MILLION,

36:32.325 --> 36:34.160
I KNOW I'M LISTING
THESE UNITS

36:34.194 --> 36:35.628
HIGHER THAN
MOST BROKERS WOULD.

36:35.662 --> 36:37.597
ANYWAY, FEEL FREE
TO WALK AROUND.

36:37.630 --> 36:40.233
BUT THESE FINISHES
WILL MAKE IT ALL WORTHWHILE.

36:40.266 --> 36:42.068
SO STOP HERE,
THIS IS OUR POWDER.

36:42.068 --> 36:43.837
- LOVELY. GORGEOUS.

36:43.870 --> 36:44.904
- WHAT DO YOU THINK
ABOUT THE COLOR?

36:44.938 --> 36:46.373
- LOVE THE COLOR.
IT'S DREAMY.

36:46.406 --> 36:47.707
- I MEAN, LOOK AT THIS MARBLE
HERE, AND THE BACKSPLASH.

36:47.741 --> 36:48.775
GORGEOUS, RIGHT?

36:48.808 --> 36:49.876
- IS THIS A CALCUTTA?
WHAT IS THIS?

36:49.909 --> 36:51.611
- YES, IT IS.
- BEAUTIFUL.

36:51.644 --> 36:52.979
- OOH.

36:53.079 --> 36:55.181
- AND THE RIGHT BROKERS
WILL UNDERSTAND THIS.

36:55.215 --> 36:56.983
YOU HAVE A BUYER MAYBE,
FOR SOMETHING IN SOHO?

36:57.083 --> 36:58.251
- YES, I DO, ACTUALLY.

36:58.284 --> 36:59.285
I THINK HE'S GONNA
FALL IN LOVE.

36:59.319 --> 37:00.553
- YOU THINK SO?
WHERE IS HE FROM?

37:00.587 --> 37:02.555
- HE'S FROM MALIBU.
- OOH. OKAY.

37:02.589 --> 37:03.857
- AND HE'S LOOKING FOR
A PIED-A-TERRE.

37:03.890 --> 37:05.258
- OKAY.

37:05.291 --> 37:08.428
- SO HE'LL BE HERE ONCE A MONTH,
AND THIS FEELS RIGHT.

37:08.461 --> 37:10.163
- YEAH? WELL, WAIT--WAIT TILL
YOU SEE THE BATHROOMS.

37:10.196 --> 37:11.498
YOU HAVEN'T SEEN
ALL OF IT YET.

37:11.531 --> 37:12.632
- LOVE THE FINISHES.

37:12.665 --> 37:13.833
- WOW.

37:13.867 --> 37:15.669
[overlapping chatter]

37:18.038 --> 37:18.938
- OH, YOU LIKE THE TUB?

37:19.039 --> 37:21.875
I HANDPICKED IT.

37:21.908 --> 37:23.443
YEAH.
- IT'S GORGEOUS.

37:23.476 --> 37:24.844
- LET'S DO A TEST.

37:24.878 --> 37:26.046
HOW MANY BROKERS
CAN WE GET IN THE SHOWER?

37:26.079 --> 37:28.248
[laughter]
GO IN. NO, SERIOUSLY.

37:28.281 --> 37:30.050
I WANT TO TAKE A PICTURE
AND PUT IT ON MY WEBSITE.

37:30.083 --> 37:31.251
[laughter]

37:31.284 --> 37:32.752
CAN WE FIT TEN BROKERS
INTO THE SHOWER?

37:32.786 --> 37:33.820
[laughter]

37:33.853 --> 37:34.954
OKAY, SO, UH, WITH ME,
IT'S TEN.

37:35.055 --> 37:36.389
OKAY, TAKE A PICTURE.

37:36.423 --> 37:38.058
[laughter]

37:38.058 --> 37:39.426
- READY?

37:39.459 --> 37:42.395
[laughter]

37:42.429 --> 37:44.397
- CAN YOU TURN ON
THE WATER NOW?

37:44.431 --> 37:47.400
[upbeat music]

37:47.434 --> 37:53.073
* *

37:53.073 --> 37:56.376
- AFTER THE OPEN HOUSE
ON 54 PINE STREET,

37:56.409 --> 37:58.678
I HAVE REALIZED THAT THE BEST
THING TO DO FOR THIS LISTING

37:58.712 --> 38:00.280
IS TO LOWER THE PRICE.

38:00.313 --> 38:02.549
- HI. HOW ARE YOU?
- GOOD. HOW ARE YOU?

38:02.582 --> 38:06.019
THERE IS ABSOLUTELY
NO OWNER IN THIS WORLD

38:06.019 --> 38:07.387
THAT LIKES
WHEN SOMEBODY TELLS THEM

38:07.420 --> 38:09.255
THAT THE PRICE
OF THEIR APARTMENT

38:09.289 --> 38:10.457
NEEDS TO BE DECREASED.

38:10.490 --> 38:11.458
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
FOR COMING.

38:11.491 --> 38:12.459
- IT'S COLD OUTSIDE.

38:12.492 --> 38:13.860
- I AM VERY OLD FASHIONED

38:13.893 --> 38:15.462
AND I STILL LIKE TO MEET
FACE-TO-FACE.

38:15.495 --> 38:17.130
- [laughs]
THAT'S GOOD, THAT'S GOOD.

38:17.163 --> 38:18.698
- SO THE REASON
I BROUGHT YOU HERE IS

38:18.732 --> 38:22.702
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT
THE PROGRESS OF 54 PINE STREET.

38:22.736 --> 38:25.739
SO, WE DID
OUR FIRST OPEN HOUSE,

38:25.772 --> 38:28.041
AND I KEEP ON RECEIVING
THE SAME RESPONSE.

38:28.074 --> 38:30.677
THEY CAN'T COME TO TERMS
WITH THE PRICE.

38:30.710 --> 38:33.947
THEY FEEL THAT IT'S--IT'S
TOO HIGH, AND I AGREE WITH THEM.

38:34.047 --> 38:37.250
AND FOR PEOPLE TO CON--
EVEN CONSIDER OUR APARTMENT,

38:37.283 --> 38:39.586
WE HAVE TO
GIVE IT A GOOD PRICE.

38:39.619 --> 38:43.056
AND I THINK THAT PRICE
IS TO BRING IT 1,299,000,

38:43.056 --> 38:44.824
AND THE REASON
I GO WITH 1,299,000,

38:44.858 --> 38:46.092
AND I KNOW
YOU DON'T LIKE THAT 2.

38:46.126 --> 38:47.460
- WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?

38:47.494 --> 38:48.862
WHEN WE FIRST SAT DOWN,

38:48.895 --> 38:52.265
YOU SAID YOU WERE GONNA SELL
THIS APARTMENT LIKE A CHAMPION.

38:54.234 --> 38:56.403
IT'S A PRETTY LAME CHAMPION
TO ME.

38:56.436 --> 38:58.338
SO, WHAT'S GOING ON?

38:58.371 --> 39:02.242
- LISTEN, I'M TRYING TO MAKE
THIS WORK FOR YOU, AND--

39:02.275 --> 39:04.177
- BUT IT'S NOT WORKING.

39:04.210 --> 39:05.745
- IT--IT WILL WORK,

39:05.779 --> 39:07.013
IF YOU'RE--IF YOU'RE
WITH ME IN THE SAME BOAT.

39:07.047 --> 39:08.748
YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND,

39:08.782 --> 39:10.216
IT'S NOT WHAT
WE THINK IT'S WORTH,

39:10.250 --> 39:12.585
IT'S WHAT THE MARKET
DICTATES THAT IT'S WORTH.

39:12.619 --> 39:14.421
EVERYBODY THAT COMES
INTO THIS APARTMENT

39:14.454 --> 39:16.022
IS GOING TO
HAVE TO DO WORK.

39:16.022 --> 39:17.457
THEY'RE GOING TO
UPDATE THE KITCHEN.

39:17.490 --> 39:18.792
MAYBE BREAK SOME WALLS.

39:18.825 --> 39:21.061
SO IF WE'RE PRICED EXACTLY
THE SAME WAY THAT LOOK--

39:21.094 --> 39:22.829
THAT THESE FULL-SERVICE
BUILDINGS ARE PRICED,

39:22.862 --> 39:24.264
THEY MIGHT AS WELL JUST GO

39:24.297 --> 39:26.066
WITH THE FULL-SERVICE BUILDING
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

39:26.099 --> 39:28.568
PEOPLE COME TO
THE FINANCIAL DISTRICT

39:28.601 --> 39:29.636
FOR BUILDINGS
WITH AMENITIES.

39:29.669 --> 39:31.705
THIS BUILDING
HAS NONE OF THAT.

39:31.738 --> 39:34.674
BY LOWERING THE PRICE,
THIS EVENS THE PLAYING FIELD.

39:34.708 --> 39:40.146
AT THIS PRICE, AT 1.35,
IT'S NOT GOING TO WORK.

39:40.180 --> 39:42.082
AND ANY OTHER AGENT

39:42.115 --> 39:43.783
WOULD NOT HAVE THE BALLS TO TELL
YOU THIS TO YOUR FACE,

39:43.817 --> 39:45.885
BUT I NEED TO TELL YOU
WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE MARKET,

39:45.919 --> 39:49.723
AND I NEED YOU
ON BOARD WITH ME.

39:53.059 --> 39:54.227
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

39:54.260 --> 39:56.129
I DON'T WANT IT TO BE
ON THE MARKET FOREVER,

39:56.162 --> 39:58.131
AND RIGHT NOW WE'RE BASICALLY
LOSING MONEY,

39:58.164 --> 40:01.468
AND WE WANT TO MAKE
A PROFIT OUT OF IT,

40:01.501 --> 40:06.473
SO I'M GONNA GO AHEAD
AND SAY YES, LET'S DO IT.

40:06.506 --> 40:08.875
BUT UNDERSTAND
THAT I AM NOT HAPPY.

40:08.908 --> 40:11.945
- NOW THAT WE HAVE LOWERED
THE PRICE, I NEED TO DELIVER.

40:11.978 --> 40:15.215
UNDERSTOOD.
WOW, YOU REALLY ARE TOUGH.

40:15.248 --> 40:16.416
- [laughs]

40:16.449 --> 40:17.584
- COMING UP...

40:17.617 --> 40:19.452
- IS THIS A JOKE?
ARE YOU KIDDING?

40:26.693 --> 40:30.363
[accordion music]

40:30.397 --> 40:32.599
- "WE VERY MUCH REGRET
TO ANNOUNCE

40:32.632 --> 40:36.469
THAT WE ARE NOW AT WAR
WITH GERMANY."

40:36.503 --> 40:37.537
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

40:37.570 --> 40:39.205
- I AM WORKING.

40:39.239 --> 40:43.677
I AM SENDING E-MAILS,
TALKING ABOUT CONTRACTS

40:43.710 --> 40:46.012
AND SETTING UP LISTINGS,

I WANT TO GET THIS WRAPPED UP
AND CLOSED.

41:18.545 --> 41:21.181
WHAT? WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

41:35.428 --> 41:38.665
SO YOU USED MY OFFER
TO GO UPSTAIRS

41:38.698 --> 41:42.402
AND GET A BETTER DEAL,
THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE TELLING ME?

41:42.435 --> 41:43.570

I UNDERSTAND YOU CORRECTLY,

JUST [bleep] SAID.

ARE YOU--ARE--IS THIS A JOKE?
ARE YOU KIDDING?

41:55.782 --> 41:58.151
YOU CAN'T DO THIS TO ME.
NOT ON THIS APARTMENT.

FOLLOW THROUGH, PLEASE.

42:01.221 --> 42:04.858
YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND.
