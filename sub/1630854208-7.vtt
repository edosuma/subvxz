00:02.536 --> 00:04.272
<i>Previously on</i> The Equalizer...

00:07.275 --> 00:08.876
Get in.
I owe you one.

00:08.976 --> 00:11.812
I say letting me take you
to dinner might make us even.

00:11.912 --> 00:14.182
Good to know.

00:14.282 --> 00:16.384
That a yes?

00:16.484 --> 00:18.486
It's about me and my mom.

00:18.586 --> 00:19.753
I asked her to train me,

00:19.853 --> 00:21.055
you know, how to
protect myself...

00:21.155 --> 00:23.057
And she said no.
She did.

00:23.157 --> 00:26.394
If Delilah is not ready
when the time comes,

00:26.494 --> 00:27.895
that will be my fault.

00:27.995 --> 00:29.497
I don't know,
something in my gut

00:29.597 --> 00:30.898
tells me she's hiding something.

00:30.998 --> 00:33.101
Honey, she's not
the kind of kid who's gonna go

00:33.201 --> 00:34.535
sneaking around.

00:37.105 --> 00:39.907
If somebody grabs you,
don't think. Just act.

01:40.801 --> 01:44.272
talented, multi-platinum
selling artist Misty.

01:46.274 --> 01:47.441
Misty, thank you for joining us.

01:47.541 --> 01:49.109
Oh, my pleasure, Angela.

01:49.210 --> 01:51.845
It feels so good
to be back here in New York,

01:51.945 --> 01:53.581
especially for the last leg
of my Paradise tour,

01:53.681 --> 01:57.251
and back here, where I played
my very first gig. Yeah.

01:57.351 --> 01:59.287
And this is the anniversary
of that performance, right?

01:59.387 --> 02:00.854
That's right.
The very first time

02:00.954 --> 02:02.723
the public heard your
Grammy-winning hit "Paradise."

02:02.823 --> 02:05.559
Yes, that's right,
and I-I love the fans so much.

02:05.659 --> 02:07.195
They're the reason
I've come this far.

02:07.295 --> 02:08.562
And that's why
I wanted them

02:08.662 --> 02:10.464
all here today.
And I'm told

02:10.564 --> 02:11.565
you have a big
announcement for them.

02:11.665 --> 02:14.468
That's right, Angela.
Years ago,

02:14.568 --> 02:17.205
I was discovered
on this very stage,

02:17.305 --> 02:20.574
so it's fitting that
my performance tomorrow night

02:20.674 --> 02:23.244
will also be my last.

02:23.344 --> 02:25.613
I'm retiring
from the music industry.

02:26.814 --> 02:28.616
What?
You can't!

02:28.716 --> 02:31.352
This is awful.

02:31.452 --> 02:34.021
Make way.
Make way, please.

02:34.121 --> 02:35.323
You should've given me
the heads up.

02:35.423 --> 02:36.890
So you could
talk me out of it?

02:36.990 --> 02:38.692
So I wouldn't look like
a fool to the people

02:38.792 --> 02:40.894
I'm negotiating your
huge new contract with.

02:40.994 --> 02:43.331
A contract I told you
I didn't want, Martin.

02:43.431 --> 02:44.565
I get it.
You're tired.

02:44.665 --> 02:45.733
We'll send you off
to the Bahamas

02:45.833 --> 02:47.301
for a few days
to recharge.

02:47.401 --> 02:49.370
It's not just
about the business.

02:50.137 --> 02:52.740
I'm tired of being a brand,
not a person,

02:52.840 --> 02:56.210
and everyone telling me
what to do, especially you.

02:57.010 --> 03:00.214
It is my job
to help guide you.

03:00.314 --> 03:03.217
I'm a grown-ass woman.

03:03.317 --> 03:05.886
I can make my own decisions.
And I've made this one.

03:05.986 --> 03:07.655
And what about all the people
you're letting down?

03:07.755 --> 03:09.357
Your fans, your band...

03:09.457 --> 03:11.592
That's not who you're actually
worried about, is it, Martin?

03:11.692 --> 03:15.529
Sure, losing your
next contract affects me.

03:15.629 --> 03:18.566
But my concern is you.

03:20.501 --> 03:21.969
Your fan mail.

03:22.069 --> 03:23.804
Thank you, Z.

03:23.904 --> 03:25.639
This is who you are.

03:25.739 --> 03:27.040
Your identity.

03:27.140 --> 03:29.009
You can't just walk
away from all that.

03:29.109 --> 03:30.010
Watch me.

03:30.110 --> 03:31.279
And do what instead?

03:31.379 --> 03:35.015
I don't know,
have... an actual life.

03:35.916 --> 03:39.019
Someone to wake up
next to every morning.

03:39.119 --> 03:40.354
Start a family with.

03:40.454 --> 03:42.823
There'll be
plenty of time for that later.

03:42.923 --> 03:45.125
But now, you...

03:45.926 --> 03:48.028
Great, it's the label.
Mm-hmm.

03:48.128 --> 03:49.430
I'm sure they've heard.
Mm-hmm.

03:49.530 --> 03:51.299
I got to take this.

03:51.399 --> 03:53.100
Yeah, what?

03:53.200 --> 03:55.669
Well, I didn't know she
was going to do that.

03:55.769 --> 03:58.171
Stay back.

04:01.409 --> 04:02.776
Is that blood?

04:11.419 --> 04:13.053
Wait a minute.

04:14.788 --> 04:16.557
Now, who would eat

04:16.657 --> 04:18.926
the whole box
of Honey Toasted Crunchies

04:19.026 --> 04:20.594
and then put it back
in the cabinet?

04:20.694 --> 04:22.363
Who do you think?

04:23.731 --> 04:25.499
I'll pick some more up
later when I go out.

04:25.599 --> 04:27.435
Good morning.

04:27.535 --> 04:28.569
Good morning, Dee.

04:28.669 --> 04:30.904
Well, aren't you
full of sunshine.

04:31.004 --> 04:33.173
A good night of sleep
will change your life.

04:33.273 --> 04:34.475
I don't know,

04:34.575 --> 04:36.209
your energy
seems different.

04:36.310 --> 04:37.378
You're more, uh...

04:37.478 --> 04:39.212
confident.

04:39.847 --> 04:41.982
You see something
different about her?

04:42.082 --> 04:45.819
No, she's just as
beautiful as always.

04:45.919 --> 04:48.021
Well, I'm gonna
go grab some

04:48.121 --> 04:50.023
breakfast down at New World.
You want to join me?

04:50.123 --> 04:52.025
Uh, sorry, Mom.
Actually, Mel and I

04:52.125 --> 04:53.727
are gonna catch
an early bird sale

04:53.827 --> 04:55.929
in SoHo
before school.
Oh, really?

04:56.029 --> 04:57.398
Mm-hmm.

04:57.498 --> 05:00.668
Well, good to see you guys
spending time together.

05:00.768 --> 05:02.503
Yeah, I like her a lot.

05:02.603 --> 05:04.505
She's cool.
Can I get a rain check

05:04.605 --> 05:05.873
on breakfast, though?
Sure,

05:05.973 --> 05:07.508
if I can
get on your calendar.

05:07.608 --> 05:09.176
I'm still gonna go

05:09.276 --> 05:11.211
grab some breakfast
before my work meeting,

05:11.311 --> 05:13.581
so have fun.

05:17.818 --> 05:19.086
See you.
Have a good day.

05:19.186 --> 05:20.388
You too.

05:20.488 --> 05:22.356
By the way,

05:22.456 --> 05:25.025
stores aren't
open this early.

05:26.727 --> 05:28.396
I know what
you and Mel are doing.

05:28.496 --> 05:30.898
Hmm?
Don't even.

05:30.998 --> 05:33.767
I saw her training you.

05:35.335 --> 05:37.671
I know Mom said no,
but what choice do I have?

05:37.771 --> 05:39.339
Okay? What if something
happens again, and I...

05:39.440 --> 05:42.543
Listen, I understand
why you're doing it.

05:42.643 --> 05:44.412
So, you're okay with it?

05:44.512 --> 05:46.780
You wanting to learn how
to protect yourself, yes.

05:46.880 --> 05:49.182
Doing it behind
your mother's back?

05:49.282 --> 05:51.284
I know.
I hate lying to Mom.

05:51.385 --> 05:53.020
Then you tell her.

05:54.622 --> 05:56.189
Or be damn sure I will.

05:56.289 --> 05:58.826
I wouldn't even know
where to begin.

05:59.660 --> 06:02.463
Well, you were
resourceful enough

06:02.563 --> 06:04.965
to rope Mel into this.

06:05.065 --> 06:07.300
I'm sure you'll
figure it out.

06:13.474 --> 06:15.776
I'll admit it is disturbing,

06:15.876 --> 06:17.845
but it doesn't
scream immediate threat.

06:17.945 --> 06:18.979
Not by itself,

06:19.079 --> 06:20.213
but this is the latest

06:20.313 --> 06:21.682
in a series
of escalating incidents.

06:21.782 --> 06:23.216
Random cars
driving by the house,

06:23.316 --> 06:25.185
mysterious phone calls
in the middle of the night.

06:25.285 --> 06:27.254
My gut tells me
to take this seriously.

06:27.354 --> 06:29.490
Well, what does Misty
think about these incidents?

06:29.590 --> 06:30.958
She doesn't know about them.

06:31.058 --> 06:33.827
It's my job to keep her
safe so she can perform,

06:33.927 --> 06:35.596
not stress her out
over every little issue.

06:35.696 --> 06:37.631
Not so little anymore, is it?

06:37.731 --> 06:38.799
Well, over the years,

06:38.899 --> 06:40.901
she's had all
kinds of fans,

06:41.001 --> 06:42.035
some more aggressive
than others,

06:42.135 --> 06:43.370
but nothing
like this.

06:43.471 --> 06:44.705
Well, have you
taken it to the police?

06:44.805 --> 06:45.839
I did.

06:45.939 --> 06:47.508
They said
they would look into it,

06:47.608 --> 06:49.843
but that doesn't help Misty.
She performs tonight,

06:49.943 --> 06:51.011
and I have to keep her safe.

06:51.111 --> 06:52.546
Well, why not cancel the show?

06:52.646 --> 06:54.114
Well, I've tried to
convince her, but her fans

06:54.214 --> 06:56.283
fly from all over the world
to see her.

06:56.383 --> 06:58.752
Save all year to afford
a plane ticket, a hotel.

06:58.852 --> 07:00.120
She doesn't
want to let them down.

07:00.220 --> 07:03.123
Look, I know
you're concerned for her,

07:03.223 --> 07:04.825
but I'm not security for hire.

07:05.593 --> 07:07.661
Now, I can recommend
a firm that specializes

07:07.761 --> 07:09.129
in executive protection.

07:09.229 --> 07:11.298
I'm afraid it's not that simple.

07:11.398 --> 07:14.234
Misty's opposed to bringing
on outside security.

07:14.334 --> 07:15.703
Because?

07:15.803 --> 07:18.305
Because she's been
burned in the past.

07:18.405 --> 07:20.307
Last time I brought
on an outside team,

07:20.407 --> 07:21.975
they roughed up
some of her fans,

07:22.075 --> 07:23.110
and then, when
I fired them,

07:23.210 --> 07:25.145
they sold her out
to the tabloids.

07:25.245 --> 07:27.781
I know, she has
a rep as being

07:27.881 --> 07:30.383
a demanding,
selfish diva.

07:30.484 --> 07:31.652
I've heard the rumors.

07:31.752 --> 07:32.653
Whatever
you've heard,

07:32.753 --> 07:33.787
it's not true.

07:33.887 --> 07:35.055
The press
needs headlines

07:35.155 --> 07:36.757
to drive traffic
to their websites.

07:36.857 --> 07:38.792
I'm telling you, I've worked
with Misty for almost a decade.

07:38.892 --> 07:40.393
She is the most considerate,

07:40.494 --> 07:42.229
thoughtful, loving person

07:42.329 --> 07:43.497
I have ever known.

07:43.597 --> 07:44.498
Well, you sound like

07:44.598 --> 07:45.666
you really
care about her.

07:45.766 --> 07:46.967
I do.

07:47.901 --> 07:50.804
It's hard not to
once you get to know her.

07:51.872 --> 07:53.807
Will you help me?

07:57.878 --> 07:59.312
I gave the letter to Dante.

07:59.412 --> 08:01.782
Maybe he can pull some
prints or some DNA.

08:01.882 --> 08:03.016
That's so gross.

08:03.116 --> 08:04.384
I mean, I don't care
if The Flaming Lips,

08:04.484 --> 08:06.353
the Pixies and Pavement
formed a supergroup,

08:06.453 --> 08:07.955
you would not see me
spilling my blood

08:08.055 --> 08:11.024
in some sort of sick
tribute for anyone.

08:11.992 --> 08:14.227
Well, obsession can make people

08:14.327 --> 08:16.930
do some bizarre things.
I guess.

08:17.030 --> 08:19.032
Hey, where's Mel?
She still shopping with...

08:20.333 --> 08:21.468
Hey, guys.

08:21.569 --> 08:22.636
Wow, shopping
must've been intense.

08:22.736 --> 08:24.504
Yeah, yeah.

08:24.605 --> 08:27.040
You blow my child's
whole college fund?

08:27.140 --> 08:30.243
Uh, no, she didn't...
she couldn't settle on anything.

08:30.343 --> 08:32.813
Wait a minute,
Misty is our client?

08:32.913 --> 08:35.082
Okay, let's say,
for the sake of argument,

08:35.182 --> 08:36.349
this one-named
wonder couldn't afford

08:36.449 --> 08:38.385
an entire army
of security guards,

08:38.485 --> 08:40.253
I mean, is this really
the person you want to be

08:40.353 --> 08:42.122
working with, right here?
Seriously?

08:42.222 --> 08:43.456
Mr. "The government
is always lying to us"

08:43.557 --> 08:44.758
believes what he reads

08:44.858 --> 08:46.259
in tabloids?
Hey, the tabloids

08:46.359 --> 08:48.596
believe in UFOs.
Oh, man.

08:48.696 --> 08:49.863
What I don't see up there

08:49.963 --> 08:51.364
is Misty's charity work,

08:51.464 --> 08:54.034
her musical education program,
her volunteerism,

08:54.134 --> 08:56.169
plus, the woman
can sing.

08:56.269 --> 08:59.607
It doesn't matter whether
she's a saint or a diva,

08:59.707 --> 09:01.408
she deserves to be safe.

09:01.508 --> 09:02.643
How are you supposed
to help her, anyway?

09:02.743 --> 09:03.644
I mean, you said she didn't want

09:03.744 --> 09:05.078
uh, extra security, right?

09:05.178 --> 09:07.280
Well, who said we were
going in as security?

09:09.683 --> 09:10.951
Want to have some fun?

09:11.051 --> 09:12.586
Do I detect
the return

09:12.686 --> 09:14.487
of Pepper Wallace?

09:22.395 --> 09:24.865
I'm gonna need a, uh, LED panel

09:24.965 --> 09:26.366
with a softbox as the key.

09:26.466 --> 09:27.701
You know, I just want
to keep things nice and...

09:27.801 --> 09:28.702
nice and soft.

09:28.802 --> 09:29.870
Who are you talking to?

09:29.970 --> 09:31.404
You. We're a small
crew here.

09:31.504 --> 09:32.640
We all got to
wear a lot of hats.

09:32.740 --> 09:33.674
Oh, that's so cute,

09:33.774 --> 09:35.042
but that hat doesn't go with

09:35.142 --> 09:36.509
this outfit, so...

09:36.610 --> 09:37.878
Thank you.

09:37.978 --> 09:39.647
Watch it. Sorry.

09:40.981 --> 09:43.316
Misty, this is
the, uh, film crew

09:43.416 --> 09:45.185
that's gonna be shooting
behind-the-scenes footage

09:45.285 --> 09:46.687
for the farewell concert.

09:46.787 --> 09:49.189
Misty.
Pepper Wallace. Producer.

09:49.289 --> 09:52.025
I can't tell you
how honored we are

09:52.125 --> 09:53.794
to be covering such
a historic event.

09:53.894 --> 09:55.495
I-I think

09:55.595 --> 09:58.899
there's been some sort
of misunderstanding.

09:58.999 --> 10:00.433
No one consulted me about this.

10:00.533 --> 10:02.302
I thought Martin
and your publicist had.

10:02.402 --> 10:06.306
They didn't, but if
we were going to do this,

10:06.406 --> 10:07.875
we should just use
the crew we always use.

10:07.975 --> 10:09.777
There's no use in
bringing in strangers.

10:09.877 --> 10:11.178
Misty, I looked into this,

10:11.278 --> 10:12.746
I vetted them,
I checked their credentials.

10:12.846 --> 10:14.982
This is three of the best
filmmakers in the whole city.

10:15.082 --> 10:16.684
They're gonna make you
look excellent.
Excuse me.

10:16.784 --> 10:18.085
Misty, your herbal tea.

10:18.185 --> 10:19.386
We got to take care
of that voice.

10:19.486 --> 10:20.553
Thank you, Z.

10:22.522 --> 10:23.657
Ms. Wallace,

10:23.757 --> 10:26.960
this performance is
an intimate setting.

10:27.060 --> 10:28.428
Having a film crew
follow me around

10:28.528 --> 10:30.297
is the opposite of the image
I want to project.

10:30.397 --> 10:32.199
Funny you should mention image.

10:32.299 --> 10:33.934
There are a lot
of people out there

10:34.034 --> 10:36.136
pushing one of you that
is not very flattering.

10:36.236 --> 10:37.705
And flat-out not true.

10:37.805 --> 10:39.707
But this is your chance

10:39.807 --> 10:40.841
to control your narrative.

10:40.941 --> 10:42.209
No one can explain

10:42.309 --> 10:44.377
why you're retiring
better than you can.

10:44.477 --> 10:47.715
And your fans want to hear
your story told your way.

10:47.815 --> 10:49.016
They don't want to read

10:49.116 --> 10:51.018
made-up stuff
in the gossip rags.

10:52.219 --> 10:53.821
And you think
this is a good idea?

10:53.921 --> 10:55.022
I do.

10:55.555 --> 10:59.960
Well, I usually run stuff
like this past my publicist...

11:01.695 --> 11:03.163
But I trust you.

11:03.263 --> 11:04.898
Let's do it.

11:04.998 --> 11:06.867
All right. Okay, everyone,
Let's do it.

11:06.967 --> 11:08.335
let's get it together.

11:08.435 --> 11:09.569
Yeah.

11:53.446 --> 11:54.414
Aah!

12:05.258 --> 12:08.728
Misty! Are you okay?
A man-- he went that way.

12:10.630 --> 12:12.499
You sure you're okay?
I think so.

12:12.599 --> 12:14.167
I'm okay.

12:14.267 --> 12:15.435
Whew.

12:15.535 --> 12:17.104
I'm okay.

12:17.204 --> 12:19.572
Another man
trying to knock me down?

12:19.672 --> 12:21.308
Whew, it's gonna take
a lot more than that

12:21.408 --> 12:22.442
to keep me
out the game.

12:23.343 --> 12:24.778
He's gone.
Well, who
the hell was that

12:24.878 --> 12:26.814
and what did they want?
I don't know,

12:26.914 --> 12:28.782
but this is unacceptable.

12:34.554 --> 12:36.523
All right, so
the intruder chloroformed

12:36.623 --> 12:38.458
the, uh, security guard
that was stationed

12:38.558 --> 12:39.960
at the back entrance
of Misty's suite.

12:40.060 --> 12:41.694
Here he is
running down the hall

12:41.795 --> 12:43.263
a few minutes later,
Lucas not far behind.

12:43.363 --> 12:45.032
Then he disappears
into the stairwell.

12:45.132 --> 12:47.567
Hey, a maintenance crew just
found the intruder's mask

12:47.667 --> 12:49.870
and hoodie
in the 15th-floor staircase.

12:49.970 --> 12:51.371
I mean, once he
ditched his disguise,

12:51.471 --> 12:52.739
he's just another hotel guest.

12:52.840 --> 12:54.107
He could've
got off at any floor.

12:54.207 --> 12:55.308
Well, the question is

12:55.408 --> 12:56.609
how did he
get into Misty's suite?

12:56.709 --> 12:57.544
Well, according
to the manager,

12:57.644 --> 12:58.979
he used a master key card

12:59.079 --> 13:00.881
belonging to someone
on the janitorial staff.

13:00.981 --> 13:03.216
A guy named
Edrin Foxx.

13:03.316 --> 13:04.784
Do we know where he is?

13:04.885 --> 13:06.553
He clocked in this morning,
but he's currently MIA.

13:06.653 --> 13:07.821
And get this:

13:07.921 --> 13:09.322
he was hired
just three weeks ago.

13:09.422 --> 13:12.492
So it's possible he just
took the job because he knew

13:12.592 --> 13:13.994
Misty was coming. Yup.

13:14.094 --> 13:15.428
Find out what we can
about this guy.

13:15.528 --> 13:16.763
Already digging in.

13:17.697 --> 13:18.899
Hey, Lucas.

13:18.999 --> 13:20.533
How's Misty?
Too well.

13:20.633 --> 13:23.336
She's insisting I take her
to the club for a sound check.

13:23.436 --> 13:25.138
But the guy from her room
is still out there.

13:25.238 --> 13:27.174
She's convinced herself
it was just a souvenir hunter,

13:27.274 --> 13:29.242
and if he wanted to
hurt her, he would have.

13:29.342 --> 13:30.710
And what do you think?
I think we need to

13:30.810 --> 13:32.245
cancel the show,
but she won't listen.

13:32.345 --> 13:34.982
Good news is she wants you
all to film the sound check.

13:35.082 --> 13:36.716
Guess you made
a good impression.

13:37.584 --> 13:39.586
Looks like we're up.

13:41.354 --> 13:42.555
That was great.

13:42.655 --> 13:43.756
Just do maybe one more,
but tighter.

13:43.857 --> 13:45.658
Okay. So, Clyde,

13:45.758 --> 13:47.794
talk to me about
life on the road.

13:47.895 --> 13:49.429
With Misty,
everything's about family,

13:49.529 --> 13:51.498
so she makes it simple.

13:51.598 --> 13:53.433
But "simple"
doesn't mean easy.

13:53.533 --> 13:54.667
The days
are long.

13:54.767 --> 13:57.204
But fun.
Sometimes a bit too fun.

13:57.304 --> 13:58.538
Ain't
that the truth.

13:58.638 --> 14:01.208
But it's the
life we chose.

14:01.308 --> 14:02.575
It's not really
a choice when the melody

14:02.675 --> 14:03.576
calls you the way it does.

14:03.676 --> 14:05.078
Oh, yeah, I know. Hey, man,

14:05.178 --> 14:07.014
it's like a siren, you know?
It just sort of...

14:07.114 --> 14:09.382
Sorry.

14:09.482 --> 14:11.684
Tommy, is it
what you expected?

14:11.784 --> 14:13.286
All that and more.

14:13.386 --> 14:15.555
And yeah, sometimes it gets
a little lonely, you know.

14:15.655 --> 14:17.090
Every day a new city,

14:17.190 --> 14:19.659
but I knew
what I was getting into.

14:19.759 --> 14:21.962
I grew up around music. Mm.

14:22.062 --> 14:23.730
My mother taught me
everything I know.

14:32.639 --> 14:34.507
Yeah.

14:34.607 --> 14:35.575
Nice.

14:35.675 --> 14:37.377
Time for sound check, guys.

14:37.477 --> 14:39.179
All right. Listen,
thank you for your time.

14:39.279 --> 14:41.381

that is to pull off?

14:59.832 --> 15:01.501
Are you surprised

you get anything
off that fan letter?

15:12.712 --> 15:14.281
Yeah, a print
matched Grayson Bradley.

15:14.381 --> 15:18.451
Social media says he's
a longtime Misty fan from Ohio.

15:18.551 --> 15:19.619
Misty's people have taken out

15:19.719 --> 15:21.088
a restraining order against him.

15:21.188 --> 15:22.455
Any chance he's our intruder?

15:22.555 --> 15:23.490
Car registered in his name

15:23.590 --> 15:24.891
pulled into the hotel garage

15:24.992 --> 15:26.559
a few hours ago,
so yeah, he could be your guy.

15:26.659 --> 15:28.495
What happened to
the hotel janitor

15:28.595 --> 15:29.596
whose key card was used?

15:29.696 --> 15:30.630
Still MIA.

15:30.730 --> 15:32.532
Could they be in collusion?

15:32.632 --> 15:34.701
Like, the janitor gave
his key card to the stalker?

15:34.801 --> 15:35.768
It's possible.

15:35.868 --> 15:37.437
we need to grab Grayson ASAP.

15:37.537 --> 15:39.772
Already have. Squad car
found him dumpster diving

15:39.872 --> 15:40.873
in the hotel parking lot.

15:40.974 --> 15:41.908
Got him in the box and about to

15:42.009 --> 15:43.376
have a chat with him.

15:43.476 --> 15:45.112
Mm, can't sleep on you,

15:45.212 --> 15:46.346
can I?

15:46.446 --> 15:47.914
I wouldn't advise it.
Call you back

15:48.015 --> 15:49.382
the second I got something.

15:50.883 --> 15:53.053
Why'd you break into
Misty's hotel room?

15:53.153 --> 15:55.022
I told you,
I don't know anything

15:55.122 --> 15:57.290
about a key card, and I
didn't break in anywhere.

15:57.390 --> 15:59.226
So you run from
the officers at the hotel

15:59.326 --> 16:00.660
because you
wanted the exercise.

16:00.760 --> 16:03.230
I got scared. And...

16:03.330 --> 16:05.198
I couldn't remember
if the restraining order

16:05.298 --> 16:06.566
was still in effect.
Must be hard

16:06.666 --> 16:08.935
to keep them all straight.

16:09.036 --> 16:10.903
So, then what were
you doing in the dumpster?

16:11.004 --> 16:13.573
Looking for a memento
for my girlfriend, Ava.

16:13.673 --> 16:17.444
Your girl know you've been
sending Misty these letters?

16:18.545 --> 16:21.414
No, 'cause she's not...

16:21.514 --> 16:22.815
my girl anymore.

16:22.915 --> 16:25.952
Just found out she's
getting married next week.

16:26.053 --> 16:28.555
Misty was our favorite artist,

16:28.655 --> 16:30.157
and I thought...

16:30.257 --> 16:32.959
if I can just get Misty
to tell Ava I'm a good person,

16:33.060 --> 16:34.427
she'll come
back to me.

16:34.527 --> 16:37.697
So, you sent her a card
written in blood.

16:37.797 --> 16:38.965
I wrote her
a bunch of times,

16:39.066 --> 16:40.500
but she didn't
write back, so I...

16:40.600 --> 16:44.237
I sent that letter
to show how serious I am.

16:44.337 --> 16:46.706
When she didn't answer,
I got in my car and drove here.

16:46.806 --> 16:48.208
Even if she
wanted to write back,

16:48.308 --> 16:51.778
there was no return address.
You get that, right?

16:53.313 --> 16:55.014
I want to leave.

16:55.115 --> 16:57.350
You can't hold me.
I didn't do anything wrong.

16:57.450 --> 16:59.152
Oh, but I can.

16:59.252 --> 17:02.789
CCTV footage shows you sitting
at the hotel bar for two hours

17:02.889 --> 17:05.592
then getting up and walking off
15 minutes before an intruder

17:05.692 --> 17:07.727
entered Misty's suite.

17:07.827 --> 17:10.297
That makes you a prime suspect.

17:13.833 --> 17:15.302
How's that feel,
you little freak?

17:15.402 --> 17:16.336
Ow! Get off me!

17:16.436 --> 17:17.804
Does that hurt?

17:17.904 --> 17:19.906
Hey. Hey, come on, do you
really need to do that?

17:20.006 --> 17:21.408
You really need
to mind your own business.

17:21.508 --> 17:24.177
Noel's my friend.
That makes it my business.

17:25.078 --> 17:26.346
Here, are you okay?

17:26.446 --> 17:27.614
It's okay, Delilah.

17:27.714 --> 17:28.815
No, it's not. Come on.

17:28.915 --> 17:29.816
<i>If somebody grabs you,</i>

17:29.916 --> 17:31.818
don't think, just act.

17:36.055 --> 17:38.458
I think you broke my arm.

17:50.002 --> 17:52.105
Hey, Mel. Any news?
Yeah.

17:52.205 --> 17:54.941
Security just found
our missing hotel janitor

17:55.041 --> 17:56.376
stuffed in the closet.

17:56.476 --> 17:57.510
Alive, I hope.

17:57.610 --> 17:58.645
Yeah, chloroformed,

17:58.745 --> 17:59.946
just like the guard outside of

18:00.046 --> 18:01.648
Misty's room.
Must be our intruder.

18:01.748 --> 18:02.915
He get a look at the guy?

18:03.015 --> 18:04.151
No, but at least
we can eliminate

18:04.251 --> 18:05.452
the janitor as a suspect.

18:05.552 --> 18:06.786
When did he say
he was knocked out?

18:06.886 --> 18:07.820
Two hours ago. Why?

18:07.920 --> 18:09.122
That falls within the window

18:09.222 --> 18:11.057
that CCTV footage
showed Misty's stalker

18:11.158 --> 18:12.325
at the hotel bar.

18:12.425 --> 18:14.026
Meaning our stalker
has an alibi.

18:14.127 --> 18:15.328
He couldn't have

18:15.428 --> 18:16.896
been the one that
chloroformed the janitor.

18:16.996 --> 18:18.865
Which means he can't
be our intruder, either.

18:18.965 --> 18:22.402
In other words, we just
went from two suspects to zero.

18:23.403 --> 18:26.339
The stage is a little slippery,
so make sure there's padding

18:26.439 --> 18:27.640
on the bottom
of these shoes, okay?

18:27.740 --> 18:28.808
Mm-hmm.
Thanks.

18:28.908 --> 18:30.543
Time for tea, Misty.

18:30.643 --> 18:31.611
Oh, honestly, Zara,

18:31.711 --> 18:33.213
you should have it.

18:33.313 --> 18:35.148
I'm too nervous.
I got butterflies,

18:35.248 --> 18:37.016
and when was the last
time that happened?

18:37.116 --> 18:39.819
It's exciting.
Your last live performance.

18:39.919 --> 18:40.953
You're gonna
do great.

18:41.053 --> 18:42.489
Thanks, Z.

18:42.589 --> 18:44.424
Okay.

18:47.059 --> 18:48.495
Bad news.

18:48.595 --> 18:50.497
All of our suspects
have alibied out,

18:50.597 --> 18:52.565
which means the intruder
is still out there.

18:52.665 --> 18:55.202
And Misty's more determined
than ever to go on tonight.

18:55.302 --> 18:57.870
Well, we have to get her
to cancel the show.

18:57.970 --> 18:59.105
It's too dangerous.

18:59.206 --> 19:01.574
I thought I could protect her.

19:01.674 --> 19:03.109
But you're right.

19:03.210 --> 19:04.811
Funny thing is
I haven't seen her

19:04.911 --> 19:06.413
this happy in years.

19:06.513 --> 19:08.215
Maybe she's excited

19:08.315 --> 19:10.850
to move on
to the next chapter.

19:10.950 --> 19:13.253
Who knows--
maybe she'll figure out

19:13.353 --> 19:15.455
what's been missing
in her life.

19:15.555 --> 19:17.224
Or who.

19:20.360 --> 19:22.295
Zara? Oh, my God,

19:22.395 --> 19:24.497
Zara! Zara!
Turn-turn her
on her side.

19:24.597 --> 19:25.465
On her side.

19:25.565 --> 19:26.433
Call 911.

19:26.533 --> 19:27.867
I think she's been poisoned.

19:27.967 --> 19:31.204
The tea.
That poison was meant for me.

19:38.811 --> 19:41.281
It's gonna be fine.
You're in good hands now.

19:41.381 --> 19:42.382
Thank you so much.

19:42.482 --> 19:44.083
Come on, let's go.

19:47.754 --> 19:49.088
Well, the good news
is the paramedics

19:49.188 --> 19:51.224
say that Zara's
gonna be okay.

19:51.324 --> 19:53.092
Thank God.

19:53.192 --> 19:55.528
Misty, look, I get that this
show means a lot to you,

19:55.628 --> 19:57.397
to your fans,
but this has gone too far.

19:57.497 --> 19:58.698
It's time
to call it off.

19:58.798 --> 20:00.600
No. No, there has to be
another way.

20:00.700 --> 20:02.802
There isn't.
Not one that

20:02.902 --> 20:04.170
guarantees your safety.

20:04.271 --> 20:05.705
He's right.

20:05.805 --> 20:07.507
It's just too dangerous.

20:08.675 --> 20:12.078
Misty, please.
Let me keep you safe.

20:12.845 --> 20:15.214
If anything were
to happen to you, I'd...

20:15.315 --> 20:17.183
I'd never forgive myself.

20:18.685 --> 20:21.854
If-if you think that
we should cancel...

20:21.954 --> 20:25.625
If it's really
the only option...

20:27.126 --> 20:28.695
Then o-okay.

20:28.795 --> 20:31.063
Thank you.

20:33.099 --> 20:35.134
Misty's cancelling.

20:35.234 --> 20:36.736
That's a relief.

20:36.836 --> 20:38.338
Would have been
an amazing show.

20:38.438 --> 20:39.806
You're a fan now?

20:39.906 --> 20:41.274
Well, yeah, no, absolutely.

20:41.374 --> 20:42.409
I can admit when I'm wrong.

20:42.509 --> 20:44.010
That woman is an angel.

20:44.110 --> 20:45.578
Well, Misty's not
performing anymore,

20:45.678 --> 20:47.714
but it doesn't mean
she's out of danger.

20:47.814 --> 20:48.848
There's still someone

20:48.948 --> 20:50.016
out there who wants her dead.

20:50.116 --> 20:51.250
Right. Okay,

20:51.351 --> 20:52.952
so what do we know
about this person?

20:53.052 --> 20:55.288
Maybe we should be focusing
on what they know about her.

20:55.388 --> 20:57.089
Okay, well, clearly,
they know she drinks

20:57.189 --> 20:58.858
those herbal teas
on a schedule.

20:58.958 --> 21:00.126
Right.
Well, maybe that's what

21:00.226 --> 21:01.594
the intruder was
doing in her room--

21:01.694 --> 21:03.330
mixing poison
into her tea leaves.

21:03.430 --> 21:04.364
So it's someone who knows

21:04.464 --> 21:05.632
the details of her routine.

21:05.732 --> 21:06.866
Her inner circle.

21:06.966 --> 21:08.134
Yeah, but, I mean,
we interviewed

21:08.234 --> 21:09.636
her entire team.
These people love her.

21:09.736 --> 21:11.003
Who would want to kill her?

21:11.103 --> 21:13.340
This industry is about
dollars and cents.

21:13.440 --> 21:17.009
So you have to ask who's
getting hurt by Misty retiring?

21:17.109 --> 21:19.346
Her manager, for one.
Martin Culvert.

21:19.446 --> 21:21.614
He was pretty upset about
the retirement announcement.

21:21.714 --> 21:22.949
Yeah, that's
a good point.

21:23.049 --> 21:25.151
Uh, you know, her
band had mentioned

21:25.251 --> 21:27.053
that her label contract
was up for renewal.

21:27.153 --> 21:28.455
You know what,
let's have a little

21:28.555 --> 21:31.023
look-see into this guy.
Oh, yeah.

21:31.123 --> 21:32.892
Our pal Martin
is leveraged to the hilt

21:32.992 --> 21:34.461
after a series
of bad investments.

21:34.561 --> 21:35.728
If she leaves
the business,

21:35.828 --> 21:37.296
Martin loses everything.

21:37.397 --> 21:40.166
He needs her to sign that
contract and to keep touring.

21:40.266 --> 21:42.068
Well, doesn't that mean
he has no reason to kill her?

21:42.168 --> 21:45.405
He does if it sends her
music sales through the roof.

21:45.505 --> 21:47.206
Yup, you're right.

21:47.306 --> 21:48.441
He's got back end

21:48.541 --> 21:50.076
on her entire catalog,
plus, he's got

21:50.176 --> 21:51.578
a cowriting credit
on "Paradise."

21:51.678 --> 21:53.346
"Paradise"?
That's her biggest hit.

21:53.446 --> 21:54.747
So, if Misty dies,

21:54.847 --> 21:56.115
Martin stands to make a fortune.

21:56.215 --> 21:57.617
Hold on.

21:57.717 --> 21:59.318
Dee's school.

21:59.419 --> 22:00.587
Hello?

22:00.687 --> 22:01.688
Hi, this is Principal Neal.

22:01.788 --> 22:02.655
First, I'd like to let you know

22:02.755 --> 22:03.790
Delilah is okay,

22:03.890 --> 22:05.157
but she has been in a fight.

22:05.257 --> 22:06.959
A fight? Wait, what?

22:07.059 --> 22:08.260
Yes, ma'am, you need
to come pick her up.

22:08.361 --> 22:10.262
I'm on my way.
Can you hold, please?

22:10.363 --> 22:11.431
Hey, I got to run.

22:11.531 --> 22:12.899
Is everything okay?

22:12.999 --> 22:15.001
No, there's a problem with Dee.
See if you two

22:15.101 --> 22:16.736
can place Martin
near Misty's room

22:16.836 --> 22:17.737
at the time of the break-in.

22:17.837 --> 22:19.305
And loop Dante in.

22:19.406 --> 22:20.907
Okay.

22:22.008 --> 22:23.075
Wonder what
that was about.

22:23.175 --> 22:24.911
I don't know.
Must be important, though.

22:25.812 --> 22:27.747
Hope everything's okay.

22:30.717 --> 22:32.184
<i>A fight, Dee?</i>

22:32.284 --> 22:33.352
It wasn't that serious.

22:33.453 --> 22:35.388
Your principal
sent me the video.

22:36.188 --> 22:38.858
I recognize that
hip-toss technique.

22:38.958 --> 22:41.260
Oddly enough,
Mel taught me the same move.

22:41.360 --> 22:44.296
So, is that what you've been
doing instead of shopping--

22:44.397 --> 22:45.898
training?

22:47.834 --> 22:49.201
I can't believe
you went behind my back

22:49.301 --> 22:52.204
when I explicitly told you no.
Okay, I'm sorry,

22:52.304 --> 22:53.806
but he was bullying
my friend Noel. I...

22:53.906 --> 22:56.743
Sorry? You could've
really hurt that boy.

22:56.843 --> 22:58.711
That's why I told you
no in the first place.

22:58.811 --> 23:00.680
You're not ready
for this responsibility.

23:00.780 --> 23:02.882
I was going to tell you.
I was.

23:02.982 --> 23:05.952
But you didn't.
You chose to lie instead.

23:08.220 --> 23:09.989
I'm dropping
you off at home.

23:11.223 --> 23:13.392
But we're gonna talk
about this later.

23:17.864 --> 23:19.265
<i>You can't be serious.</i>

23:19.365 --> 23:22.134
You really think I would
try to kill my best client?

23:22.234 --> 23:24.504
From what I hear, she won't
be your client for long.

23:24.604 --> 23:25.805
That was posturing.

23:25.905 --> 23:27.907
A negotiation tactic
for a new deal.

23:28.007 --> 23:29.208
Word is she wants out,

23:29.308 --> 23:31.010
which would
leave you in the lurch.

23:31.110 --> 23:33.913
Music is her life.
Any retirement would be

23:34.013 --> 23:35.648
followed quickly
by an un-retirement.

23:35.748 --> 23:37.083
Not if she's poisoned.

23:38.284 --> 23:40.119
What exactly are
you getting at?

23:40.219 --> 23:41.488
There's a lot
of question marks

23:41.588 --> 23:44.123
dealing with an artist
who may or may not retire.

23:44.223 --> 23:46.626
Getting paid from
a dead artist's catalogue--

23:46.726 --> 23:47.994
that's a sure thing.

23:48.094 --> 23:50.262
I've been with Misty
from the beginning,

23:50.362 --> 23:51.864
shaped her career.

23:51.964 --> 23:54.200
If I hadn't written "Paradise"
for her, she'd be a nobody.

23:54.300 --> 23:56.869
Now, am I angry
that she's trying

23:56.969 --> 23:58.638
to throw it all away?
You're damn right.

23:58.738 --> 24:00.807
But would I ever hurt her?

24:00.907 --> 24:02.875
Not in a million years. Martin,

24:02.975 --> 24:04.376
where were you today
when someone

24:04.477 --> 24:05.678
broke into Misty's suite?

24:05.778 --> 24:07.680
In my room
at the hotel.

24:07.780 --> 24:09.015
And if you want
to check my story,

24:09.115 --> 24:10.783
you can ask
any of the other 20 people

24:10.883 --> 24:12.284
who were on the call with me.

24:14.754 --> 24:15.788
How'd it go with the manager?

24:15.888 --> 24:17.156
Martin's got an airtight

24:17.256 --> 24:18.691
alibi, so, no, he couldn't
have been the one

24:18.791 --> 24:19.792
who broke into Misty's room.

24:19.892 --> 24:21.861
Doesn't mean he's not behind it.

24:21.961 --> 24:23.062
Yeah, he's definitely
not the type to get

24:23.162 --> 24:24.831
his hands dirty.
He'd hire someone.

24:24.931 --> 24:26.666
He's got the connections
to do it.

24:26.766 --> 24:28.000
What do you mean?

24:28.100 --> 24:29.502
Fifteen years ago,
Martin was arrested

24:29.602 --> 24:31.103
for laundering money
through his record label.

24:31.203 --> 24:32.438
Who was he cleaning it for?

24:32.539 --> 24:34.541
Rumor was organized crime,

24:34.641 --> 24:35.975
His accountant took the fall.

24:36.075 --> 24:37.343
Still, it's clear
he moves in that world.

24:37.443 --> 24:39.445
All right, I'll have
Harry take a deeper dive

24:39.546 --> 24:41.180
into who Martin's
been in contact with.

24:41.280 --> 24:43.783
Meanwhile, you keep him there
as long as you can.

24:43.883 --> 24:46.052
Will do.
Thanks, Dante.

24:49.922 --> 24:52.559
Uh, Misty? Is it okay?

24:52.659 --> 24:53.926
She's good.

24:55.762 --> 24:57.597
Rough day, huh?

24:57.697 --> 24:59.465
How you holding up?

24:59.566 --> 25:01.267
Not as rough as Zara,

25:01.367 --> 25:02.969
but they're
keeping her overnight

25:03.069 --> 25:04.971
in the hospital
for observation.

25:05.071 --> 25:06.839
It's my fault she's in there.

25:06.939 --> 25:09.408
I mean, it's terrible
she was poisoned,

25:09.508 --> 25:11.277
but you can't
blame yourself for that.

25:11.377 --> 25:13.713
If I would have just listened
to Lucas in the first place,

25:13.813 --> 25:15.414
none of this
would have ever happened.

25:15.514 --> 25:18.651
My stubbornness
nearly cost Zara her life.

25:18.751 --> 25:20.352
She's gonna be okay.

25:20.452 --> 25:22.021
And so are you.

25:22.121 --> 25:25.592
You're gonna let people down.
That's inevitable.

25:25.692 --> 25:29.862
And you want so badly to
protect the ones you love,

25:29.962 --> 25:32.398
to keep them safe
no matter what.

25:33.365 --> 25:35.602
But sometimes...

25:35.702 --> 25:37.369
life just doesn't work that way.

25:38.537 --> 25:41.173
Spoken like someone
who's been through the fire.

25:41.273 --> 25:43.743
You got that right.

25:50.116 --> 25:53.019
So you're really
going to retire?

25:53.119 --> 25:54.887
It's time to get back to me.

25:54.987 --> 25:56.288
Well, who is "me"?

25:56.388 --> 25:57.724
Because all
we know you by

25:57.824 --> 25:59.058
is all of your accomplishments,

25:59.158 --> 26:00.727
which are
very impressive.

26:00.827 --> 26:04.196
Well, thanks, but climbing
to the mountaintop took a toll.

26:04.296 --> 26:07.634
And being a female
in this industry is no joke.

26:07.734 --> 26:08.968
Mm-hmm.

26:09.068 --> 26:10.870
I've been ripped off
by promoters, executives,

26:10.970 --> 26:12.772
business managers,
my friends

26:12.872 --> 26:14.373
have ratted me out to paparazzi.

26:14.473 --> 26:16.175
That's got to be
the worst part--

26:16.275 --> 26:17.744
thinking someone's
got your back...

26:17.844 --> 26:19.679
When really they're
looking to stick a knife in it.

26:19.779 --> 26:21.648
So, how do you trust anyone?

26:21.748 --> 26:23.049
You don't.

26:23.149 --> 26:26.552
But shutting everyone out
really does wear on you.

26:26.653 --> 26:28.821
You end up with no family,

26:28.921 --> 26:31.223
no friends, no love.

26:31.323 --> 26:33.693
Well, love--
I know you can change that.

26:35.294 --> 26:37.463
Well, I'll find out soon enough

26:37.563 --> 26:39.398
when Misty
hangs up her sparkly tops

26:39.498 --> 26:41.233
and gets back
to being Sonya Banks

26:41.333 --> 26:42.802
from East Cleveland, Ohio.

26:42.902 --> 26:45.905
That's right, Sonya Banks
from East Cleveland, Ohio.

26:46.005 --> 26:47.373
That's right.

26:47.473 --> 26:49.842
I like that.

26:49.942 --> 26:51.243
Oh, my God, Misty!

26:51.343 --> 26:52.344
We love you, Misty!

26:52.444 --> 26:53.445
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa,

26:53.545 --> 26:54.681
hold up!
Hands!

26:54.781 --> 26:58.317
Hey, I...
No!

26:58.951 --> 27:00.452
I just wanted
an autograph.

27:01.821 --> 27:03.455
Get up.

27:03.555 --> 27:04.256
Come on.

27:04.356 --> 27:06.125
Who are you?

27:06.225 --> 27:08.060
'Cause you're clearly
not a producer.

27:08.160 --> 27:10.629
You're right, and I'm sorry.

27:10.730 --> 27:13.733
Lucas hired me because
you needed extra protection.

27:13.833 --> 27:14.901
Lucas lied to me?

27:15.001 --> 27:16.836
He just wanted to keep you safe.

27:16.936 --> 27:18.237
This is why
I can't trust anyone.

27:18.337 --> 27:20.106
Misty, I am sorry.
I just... I wanted to...

27:20.206 --> 27:21.107
Get away from me.

27:21.207 --> 27:22.742
I'm sick of all the lies.

27:22.842 --> 27:24.043
Keep these people away from me.

27:24.143 --> 27:25.644
They don't work for me anymore.

27:25.745 --> 27:28.247
I trusted you, Lucas.

27:34.153 --> 27:35.421
Yeah, Harry?

27:35.521 --> 27:38.390
Hey, so Martin made
a $25,000 withdrawal

27:38.490 --> 27:40.026
from an account that was
supposed to be used

27:40.126 --> 27:41.293
for Misty's tour expenses.

27:41.393 --> 27:42.394
Except the money never made it

27:42.494 --> 27:44.030
to a vendor, it was transferred

27:44.130 --> 27:45.564
to an offshore account.
Whose account?

27:45.664 --> 27:47.566
It's a shell corp.
I-I thought he was skimming,

27:47.666 --> 27:49.635
but it doesn't seem
to have anything to do

27:49.736 --> 27:50.737
with Misty or Martin

27:50.837 --> 27:52.171
or any of his other businesses.

27:52.271 --> 27:53.272
Martin's accomplice.

27:53.372 --> 27:55.141
You mean
Misty's assassin.

27:55.241 --> 27:56.275
We need to stop him

27:56.375 --> 27:57.443
before he finishes the job.

27:57.543 --> 27:58.911
I'm not gonna let that happen.

27:59.011 --> 28:00.246
What's going on?

28:00.346 --> 28:01.981
We need to
warn Misty.

28:03.482 --> 28:04.851
Move, I need to speak to Misty.

28:04.951 --> 28:06.853
You know I can't do that.
I have vital information

28:06.953 --> 28:08.287
about Misty's safety.

28:08.387 --> 28:10.622
Do the job I hired you to do.

28:15.594 --> 28:16.796
Misty?

28:16.896 --> 28:18.630
Misty, we know
who it is.

28:18.731 --> 28:21.000
Misty!

28:21.901 --> 28:23.535
She's gone.

28:31.077 --> 28:33.512
She's not picking up.

28:33.612 --> 28:35.081
When was the last
time you saw her?

28:35.181 --> 28:36.582
When we got back.

28:36.682 --> 28:39.118
Misty said she wanted privacy,
so I checked the room,

28:39.218 --> 28:42.021
then went out into the hallway.
Maybe she went out the back.

28:42.121 --> 28:43.756
Couldn't have been more than
a few minutes ago.

28:43.856 --> 28:45.758
I'll try.
She won't recognize my number.

28:49.328 --> 28:51.663
Damn. Still no answer.

28:52.631 --> 28:54.400
I'll have my team track it.

28:54.500 --> 28:56.836
I never should have
let her out of my sights.

28:56.936 --> 28:58.304
W-We have to find her.

28:58.404 --> 29:00.639
We will, but with
Martin's hit man out there,

29:00.739 --> 29:02.108
we have to move fast.

29:02.208 --> 29:04.643
Maybe the band
knows where she is.

29:06.745 --> 29:08.047
What's up, Rob?

29:08.147 --> 29:09.982
Harry, I need you
to track Misty's phone.

29:10.082 --> 29:11.784
She's in the wind
and we haven't had a chance

29:11.884 --> 29:13.352
to warn her
about Martin's assassin.

29:13.452 --> 29:14.753
Hmm. It says here

29:14.854 --> 29:16.755
it's, uh, it's at the hotel.

29:16.856 --> 29:18.858
So she left it behind
on purpose.

29:18.958 --> 29:21.160
Any updates from Dante?

29:21.260 --> 29:22.494
He's in with Martin now,

29:22.594 --> 29:24.330
trying to convince him
to call off his guy,

29:24.430 --> 29:26.032
but I think
I may have found something

29:26.132 --> 29:28.400
that will help him with that.

29:28.500 --> 29:31.237
And... send.

29:34.773 --> 29:37.076
Recognize this guy, Martin?
No. Should I?

29:37.176 --> 29:40.146
Considering you sent his
offshore account $25,000, yeah.

29:41.113 --> 29:42.781
Let me help jog your memory.

29:42.882 --> 29:44.083
His name is Eric Stone.

29:44.183 --> 29:45.818
According to this, he gets paid

29:45.918 --> 29:48.420
to do violent things
from some very bad people,

29:48.520 --> 29:49.555
including you.

29:49.655 --> 29:50.857
Okay, uh...

29:50.957 --> 29:52.091
It's not what you think.

29:52.191 --> 29:54.626
I think you need
to call him off. Yes,

29:54.726 --> 29:55.895
I hired him,

29:55.995 --> 29:57.629
but not to go
after Misty.

29:57.729 --> 29:59.698
If not Misty, then who?

29:59.798 --> 30:01.700
Someone I wanted
to send a message to.

30:01.800 --> 30:04.703
Don't make me play
20 questions, Martin.

30:04.803 --> 30:06.973
Some kid...

30:07.073 --> 30:09.575
who claimed I stole the song
"Paradise" from his mother,

30:09.675 --> 30:10.742
which I did not.

30:10.843 --> 30:12.544
I bought that
song legally.

30:12.644 --> 30:13.579
How much?

30:14.680 --> 30:16.115
$500.

30:16.215 --> 30:18.650
You bought the rights
to a multi-platinum hit song

30:18.750 --> 30:22.621
that launched Misty's career
and the songwriter got $500?

30:22.721 --> 30:24.390
No one knew
what it was gonna be.

30:24.490 --> 30:25.858
But once the money
started pouring in,

30:25.958 --> 30:26.893
you went back to the songwriter

30:26.993 --> 30:28.094
and gave her her fair share.

30:28.194 --> 30:29.761
No?

30:29.862 --> 30:31.463
You didn't?

30:31.563 --> 30:34.333
It's not fair. No.

30:34.433 --> 30:35.834
But it's the business,

30:35.935 --> 30:37.036
and it's legal,

30:37.136 --> 30:38.270
and I have a contract
to prove it.

30:38.370 --> 30:39.638
Sounds like
that's not sitting right

30:39.738 --> 30:41.007
with this woman's son.
Rightfully so.

30:41.107 --> 30:42.741
That kid wouldn't
stop contacting me,

30:42.841 --> 30:45.277
threatening to sue, to
go to the press. He even

30:45.377 --> 30:47.346
sent a fake lawyer
after me once,

30:47.446 --> 30:48.814
but I called his bluff.

30:48.915 --> 30:50.649
Even then, he wouldn't stop,
he wouldn't back off.

30:50.749 --> 30:52.784
So you sent Eric
to explain things to him.

30:52.885 --> 30:54.786
But when Eric got there...

30:54.887 --> 30:56.755
the kid had disappeared.

30:56.855 --> 30:57.990
Vanished.

30:58.090 --> 30:59.558
The neighbors hadn't
seen him for months.

30:59.658 --> 31:01.227
What's the kid's name?

31:01.327 --> 31:02.929
Elton Smith.

31:06.098 --> 31:09.768
Come on, open up!
Kenny's not answering.

31:09.868 --> 31:12.338
Let's check Clyde's room. 1540.

31:12.438 --> 31:13.572
Harry.

31:13.672 --> 31:14.873
Talk to me. Rob,

31:14.974 --> 31:16.308
I think I know
who we're looking for.

31:16.408 --> 31:18.210
A guy whose mother
wrote Misty's hit,

31:18.310 --> 31:20.779
"Paradise."
Wait, I thought
Martin wrote "Paradise."

31:20.879 --> 31:22.514
Nope, Martin
ripped this woman off.

31:22.614 --> 31:23.515
Now the son's out for revenge.

31:23.615 --> 31:24.516
Who's the son?

31:24.616 --> 31:26.285
Elton Smith. Except, Rob,

31:26.385 --> 31:27.519
we filmed this guy.

31:27.619 --> 31:29.321
It's Misty's guitarist,
Tommy James.

31:29.421 --> 31:31.924
Wait, you're saying that
he changed his name

31:32.024 --> 31:33.425
so he could join the band.

31:33.525 --> 31:35.928
Yeah, a few months ago,
to get access to Misty.

31:36.028 --> 31:37.429
I guess when Martin
didn't do the right thing,

31:37.529 --> 31:39.098
this guy decided to
take matters into his own hands.

31:39.198 --> 31:41.667
Well, we have to
find him and stop him.

31:45.071 --> 31:47.139
Someone's in there.

31:47.239 --> 31:48.740
Stand back.

31:50.476 --> 31:51.777
What the hell?

31:51.877 --> 31:53.379
Where's Misty?
We really need to find her.

31:53.479 --> 31:55.681
Why, you need to change some
fake lines in your fake movie?

31:55.781 --> 31:57.283
Look, I deserve that,
but Misty's life

31:57.383 --> 31:58.617
is in danger, so if
you know where she is,

31:58.717 --> 31:59.986
you need to tell us.

32:00.086 --> 32:01.220
Hey, man, get off me, dude.
Easy, easy,

32:01.320 --> 32:02.955
easy.
She was here earlier,

32:03.055 --> 32:04.556
she told us about what
happened with y'all.

32:04.656 --> 32:05.691
Where is she now?

32:05.791 --> 32:06.692
She's with Tommy.
He took her

32:06.792 --> 32:09.028
back to her room.

32:17.936 --> 32:19.538
It's nice to hear you sing.

32:20.806 --> 32:22.541
Sometimes music
is the only thing

32:22.641 --> 32:23.675
that keeps me sane.

32:23.775 --> 32:25.544
"Singing loud to myself

32:25.644 --> 32:27.079
like music is my medicine."

32:27.179 --> 32:28.914
Because it is.

32:30.816 --> 32:31.984
Where are we going?

32:32.084 --> 32:33.352
I want to show
you something.

32:33.452 --> 32:35.487
Something special.

32:43.495 --> 32:45.064
Misty and Elton
are nowhere in this hotel.

32:45.164 --> 32:46.498
I got 'em.
They're in a gray Chrysler,

32:46.598 --> 32:48.267
but I can't make out the plate,

32:48.367 --> 32:50.102
and he turned
the GPS off on his phone.

32:50.202 --> 32:52.004
I'm gonna get Dante
to put a BOLO out on the car.

32:52.104 --> 32:53.139
We're running out of time.

32:53.239 --> 32:54.273
What do we know about this guy?

32:54.373 --> 32:55.641
Well, we know he spent years

32:55.741 --> 32:56.975
trying to reach out to Martin,

32:57.076 --> 32:58.644
to resolve this
in a non-violent way.

32:58.744 --> 33:00.546
So then why the escalation
to murder? What changed?

33:00.646 --> 33:01.813
I think I may have an answer.

33:01.913 --> 33:03.815
It's an obituary
for Brenda Smith.

33:03.915 --> 33:06.352
She died three months ago
of a drug overdose.

33:06.452 --> 33:08.020
And from the looks of it, they
weren't doing too well, either.

33:08.120 --> 33:09.588
Oh, his mother's death.

33:09.688 --> 33:11.457
That's what
pushed him over the edge.

33:11.557 --> 33:13.825
Yeah, I mean, sure, the guy's
overwhelmed with grief,

33:13.925 --> 33:16.895
he's got no legal remedy,
and he-and he takes his rage out

33:16.995 --> 33:19.631
on the-the woman who got famous
off his mother's song.

33:19.731 --> 33:21.300
Yeah, the woman
who is living the life

33:21.400 --> 33:22.901
his mother
should have been living.

33:23.001 --> 33:24.470
Brenda was robbed.

33:25.271 --> 33:26.372
But, okay, why now?

33:26.472 --> 33:27.539
The guy's been
in the band for months.

33:27.639 --> 33:28.807
Because he's not a killer.

33:28.907 --> 33:30.809
He's probably
been struggling with

33:30.909 --> 33:32.478
actually going
through with this.

33:32.578 --> 33:34.880
And Misty's retirement
pushed him into action.

33:34.980 --> 33:36.448
He wasn't gonna
get another shot.

33:36.548 --> 33:38.584
All right, well,
we're still no closer

33:38.684 --> 33:40.552
to knowing where,
uh, Elton took Misty.

33:40.652 --> 33:42.221
This whole thing has been
about his mother's song.

33:42.321 --> 33:44.190
That's what's been
driving him all these years.

33:44.290 --> 33:45.357
You think the answer's in there?

33:45.457 --> 33:46.358
Could be.

33:46.458 --> 33:48.094
Um, "They try to be cruel,

33:48.194 --> 33:50.862
"They try to be hard,
hopped on that train,

33:50.962 --> 33:54.066
looked up,
taken by eagles and stars."

33:54.166 --> 33:56.034
"Eagles and stars."

33:56.835 --> 33:58.737
There's a building in the city
with eagles on it.

33:58.837 --> 34:00.206
The Chrysler Building.

34:00.306 --> 34:01.807
Yeah. You think they're there?

34:01.907 --> 34:04.810
No. The song says
she's hopping a train.

34:04.910 --> 34:06.345
Okay.

34:06.445 --> 34:08.347
There are five train stations

34:08.447 --> 34:11.016
in the area,
but only one of them

34:11.117 --> 34:13.051
has got an observation deck with
a view of the Chrysler Building:

34:13.152 --> 34:14.353
Grand Central Station.

34:14.453 --> 34:15.654
I'm on my way.

34:16.455 --> 34:17.556
<i>Oh.</i>

34:17.656 --> 34:19.191
It's just as breathtaking

34:19.291 --> 34:20.892
as the first time I saw it.

34:21.960 --> 34:23.729
Something about
those city lights.

34:23.829 --> 34:27.766
♪ And high above
the rooftops, my paradise ♪

34:27.866 --> 34:31.503
♪ It's just
a dreamer's paradise ♪

34:31.603 --> 34:34.373
That is my favorite line
in that song.

34:37.609 --> 34:39.845
You mean my mother's song.

34:40.746 --> 34:42.181
What are you talking about?

34:42.281 --> 34:44.750
You know exactly what
I'm talking about.

34:44.850 --> 34:46.084
You never wrote that song.

34:46.185 --> 34:47.085
"Paradise"?

34:47.186 --> 34:48.354
I wrote the hook,

34:48.454 --> 34:49.821
but Martin wrote the song.

34:49.921 --> 34:51.823
Yeah, that's the story
you tell everyone else.

34:51.923 --> 34:53.259
Hell, you probably
half-believe it yourself now.

34:53.359 --> 34:55.127
Because it's the truth.

34:55.227 --> 34:57.263
Don't you...

34:57.363 --> 34:59.131
don't you lie.

34:59.231 --> 35:00.132
Not to me.

35:00.232 --> 35:02.234
You're scaring me, Tommy.

35:02.334 --> 35:03.402
My name's Elton.

35:03.502 --> 35:05.637
Elton Smith.

35:05.737 --> 35:07.606
You stole that song
from my mother Brenda,

35:07.706 --> 35:09.808
bullied her
to sell it for pennies.

35:09.908 --> 35:12.678
She had to go to that club
every night, bussing tables,

35:12.778 --> 35:14.546
watching you perform
to standing ovations,

35:14.646 --> 35:16.148
become an international superstar,

35:16.248 --> 35:17.416
while she struggled

35:17.516 --> 35:18.650
to bring home food
for her family.

35:18.750 --> 35:20.252
I didn't know. I swear.

35:20.352 --> 35:21.620
It destroyed her.

35:21.720 --> 35:25.056
She turned to drugs.
She-she died penniless.

35:25.157 --> 35:28.026
What you did
ended my mother's life.

35:28.126 --> 35:29.161
Now I'm gonna end yours.

35:29.261 --> 35:31.563
Please! I didn't know!

35:31.663 --> 35:32.898
She's telling the truth.
Stay back!

35:34.533 --> 35:36.635
Martin stole that song
from your mother.

35:36.735 --> 35:38.470
Misty had no idea.

35:38.570 --> 35:40.606
I never would have wanted that.

35:40.706 --> 35:43.675
Her song has touched
so many people

35:43.775 --> 35:45.844
so deeply, me included.

35:45.944 --> 35:47.813
She must have
been a special person

35:47.913 --> 35:51.683
to write something so powerful.

35:54.253 --> 35:56.722
Yeah, she was.

35:57.489 --> 36:00.326
I'm so sorry for everything
she went through.

36:00.426 --> 36:02.261
Everything you both...

36:02.361 --> 36:04.996
everything you both
had to go through.

36:05.096 --> 36:06.698
No, you're not.
No, you're not.

36:06.798 --> 36:08.934
Your mother's song
inspired so many people

36:09.034 --> 36:10.469
to reach for their dreams.

36:10.569 --> 36:12.070
But it was about

36:12.170 --> 36:13.272
more than that,

36:13.372 --> 36:15.474
it was about
never giving up, too,

36:15.574 --> 36:17.008
no matter who
wronged you.

36:17.108 --> 36:21.079
"I faced my battles,
I earned my scars.

36:21.179 --> 36:24.350
I'm still fighting,
and I'm-a keep fighting."

36:24.450 --> 36:28.186
Elton... don't do this.

36:28.287 --> 36:29.688
You got to fight.

36:29.788 --> 36:32.624
Your mother would not
want you to do this.

36:32.724 --> 36:34.826
And neither
do you.

36:44.770 --> 36:48.574
♪ They told me this place
would break my heart. ♪

36:50.776 --> 36:52.244
I'm sorry.

36:55.647 --> 36:57.249
Elton, no!
Elton, no!

36:57.349 --> 36:59.418
I got you!

36:59.518 --> 37:01.086
Grab my hand!

37:01.920 --> 37:04.990
On one, two, three.

37:11.096 --> 37:12.864
It's okay.

37:15.334 --> 37:17.336
I'm so sorry.

37:21.907 --> 37:24.943
Everything's gonna be okay.

37:35.454 --> 37:36.588
What you guys doing here?
Oh.

37:36.688 --> 37:37.756
Uh... oh. Hi.

37:37.856 --> 37:39.157
Robyn, we're here
to see Misty.

37:39.257 --> 37:40.526
Think we're gonna miss
her last show ever?

37:40.626 --> 37:42.260
Somebody changed
his mind in a hurry.

37:42.361 --> 37:44.262
Uh, I'm gonna go get a table
up front before it gets

37:44.363 --> 37:46.298
too packed, all right?
Oh, yeah, yeah,
that's a good idea.

37:46.398 --> 37:47.733
Hey.
Yeah?

37:47.833 --> 37:49.335
I need to talk to you. Okay.

37:49.435 --> 37:50.936
I know you've been training Dee.

37:51.036 --> 37:52.971
She used O-goshi
on a kid today,

37:53.071 --> 37:54.272
damn near
broke his arm.

37:54.373 --> 37:56.141
Luckily, she didn't
get expelled.

37:56.241 --> 37:57.376
I feel terrible.

37:57.476 --> 37:59.345
I obviously never
wanted that to happen.

37:59.445 --> 38:00.612
And it wouldn't have happened

38:00.712 --> 38:01.547
if you hadn't
gone behind my back.

38:01.647 --> 38:03.682
She's not ready, Mel.

38:03.782 --> 38:06.084
That's her point.
She's unprepared.

38:06.184 --> 38:07.953
Of course she's unprepared.
She's a kid.

38:08.053 --> 38:10.456
Respectfully, it's not
about her being a kid,

38:10.556 --> 38:12.424
it's about her feeling unsafe.

38:12.524 --> 38:13.559
After what happened
with Quinn,

38:13.659 --> 38:14.660
she wants to feel like,

38:14.760 --> 38:16.061
next time, she'll be able

38:16.161 --> 38:17.596
to protect hers...
There won't be a next time.

38:17.696 --> 38:19.731
Robyn...
And if there is,

38:19.831 --> 38:20.966
I'll handle it.

38:21.066 --> 38:22.968
Robyn, I overstepped.
I did.

38:23.068 --> 38:26.171
But you need to remember
that we chose this life.

38:26.271 --> 38:27.706
Dee did not.

38:27.806 --> 38:29.675
She is trying to figure out
a situation that she never

38:29.775 --> 38:31.877
asked to be put in.
Then I will help her
figure it out.

38:31.977 --> 38:34.613
I decide what
is appropriate

38:34.713 --> 38:36.748
for her to learn.
Not her.

38:36.848 --> 38:39.885
Not you. Me.

38:52.330 --> 38:54.366
Hi. What's up?

38:55.501 --> 38:56.835
What?

38:57.603 --> 38:59.471
Where?

38:59.571 --> 39:01.172
Yeah, I-I'm on my way.

39:01.272 --> 39:05.644
This song is about
love and hope,

39:05.744 --> 39:07.312
about dreaming big.

39:08.246 --> 39:10.916
So I'm gonna use
all the future profits

39:11.016 --> 39:15.153
for "Paradise" to fund
a music education program

39:15.253 --> 39:17.723
in the name
of the actual songwriter,

D.A. Grafton is asking
for a reduced sentence.

39:36.107 --> 39:38.209
It's not a slam dunk,
but it sure helps

39:38.309 --> 39:39.845

Did you know?

41:01.192 --> 41:02.227
Yes.

41:02.994 --> 41:05.463
And I felt it was
Dee's place to tell you.

41:05.564 --> 41:06.932
Clearly, she didn't.

41:07.032 --> 41:08.600
No, she didn't.

41:08.700 --> 41:10.301
And I'm furious...

41:10.401 --> 41:12.303
that my best friend
and my daughter

41:12.403 --> 41:15.674
would be so deceitful,
would lie to me like that.

41:15.774 --> 41:17.509
And well you should be.

41:20.145 --> 41:22.313
I'm not making excuses
for her, Robyn,

41:22.413 --> 41:25.517
but you've got to understand
that Dee seeing you

41:25.617 --> 41:27.118
get taken away like that--

41:27.218 --> 41:30.756
that was a game changer.

41:30.856 --> 41:32.123
She's scared,
she feels helpless.

41:32.223 --> 41:33.491
And you know what?
Frankly, neither one of us

41:33.592 --> 41:36.928
wants to be caught
in that situation ever again.

41:37.028 --> 41:38.664
So, if you want her to have

41:38.764 --> 41:40.331
any kind of
control over her life,

41:40.431 --> 41:42.167
you have got to stop
saying no to this

41:42.267 --> 41:45.537
without giving her
a good reason.

41:45.637 --> 41:47.472
The reason was made clear today.

41:47.573 --> 41:49.240
She's not ready.

41:50.141 --> 41:53.011
She's not ready?
Or you're not ready?

42:01.587 --> 42:04.790
Either way,
you got to figure this out.

42:04.890 --> 42:06.457
This is not going away.

42:10.061 --> 42:11.529
Yeah, okay.

42:11.630 --> 42:13.932
Maybe some...

42:14.032 --> 42:16.968
some basic self-defense classes

42:17.068 --> 42:18.737
would not be a bad idea.

42:18.837 --> 42:21.306
Yeah. That's a start.

42:21.406 --> 42:22.674
Yeah.

42:23.675 --> 42:25.110
And, uh,

42:25.210 --> 42:26.678
this other thing with Mel,

42:26.778 --> 42:28.213
well...

42:28.313 --> 42:30.315
...y'all got to work that out.

42:32.050 --> 42:33.585
Mm-hmm.

42:35.020 --> 42:38.089
Work it out.
Hell with that.

42:38.189 --> 42:41.693
Keep going, man!
Who the hell is that?

42:55.974 --> 42:57.475
Where is he?

42:58.977 --> 43:00.612
Where's my brother?
