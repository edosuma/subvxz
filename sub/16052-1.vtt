01:17.840 --> 01:18.921
Two to the back,

01:19.080 --> 01:20.809
Two to the front
with a single turn.

01:20.960 --> 01:26.330
two, two, two,
and a turn and down.

01:27.000 --> 01:28.001
Two...

01:31.320 --> 01:33.084
two...

01:33.280 --> 01:34.725
and...

01:58.360 --> 02:00.522
One, two, three, four,

02:00.720 --> 02:03.121
five, six, seven, eight.

04:24.840 --> 04:27.366
<i>Fifteen minutes
till the third ballet of the evening:</i>

04:27.520 --> 04:30.410
Jerome Robbins' Glass Pieces.

04:30.560 --> 04:32.847
Dancers to stage, please.

05:50.120 --> 05:52.691
Onstage call!

08:56.640 --> 08:57.971
- Sorry.
- One, two, three.

08:58.120 --> 08:59.770
That was great.
No, it was really...

08:59.920 --> 09:02.924
You know, you're doing the arms
out and around.

09:03.080 --> 09:04.650
- Sorry.
- But you know what?

09:04.800 --> 09:06.320
You make the mistakes
look really good.

09:06.360 --> 09:09.011
I think we're gonna keep that.
I like that.

09:09.360 --> 09:10.725
- Okay.
- Out and around.

09:12.200 --> 09:13.720
I liked it the first time,

09:13.800 --> 09:17.521
but now I kind of miss the...
after the turn...

09:18.000 --> 09:20.241
Okay, so the first one, I'll do,
and the second one, no.

09:20.400 --> 09:22.767
Yeah.
That's good.

09:23.120 --> 09:25.361
You know what it is?
It's because here...

09:27.080 --> 09:29.082
I'm kind of in the middle
of my legs.

09:29.240 --> 09:31.163
- Oh, okay.
- I'm not...

09:31.320 --> 09:34.051
- You mean for this?
- Yeah, that's why.

09:34.120 --> 09:35.531
Do you want to go...
We can do the old way.

09:35.720 --> 09:37.484
I have to just work on it
so that I...

09:38.000 --> 09:39.729
because I'm, like, really...

09:40.320 --> 09:41.321
What if... Yeah.

09:41.480 --> 09:43.369
What if you thought of it moving,
like...

09:43.560 --> 09:45.210
Yeah, constantly forward?

09:45.360 --> 09:47.488
- Yeah.
- Like, here...

09:48.160 --> 09:51.403
Start... I don't know, yeah.
That's too much.

09:51.600 --> 09:52.761
Yeah.

09:52.920 --> 09:54.640
Or it doesn't even...
I think you're over...

09:54.680 --> 09:56.682
Maybe you're thinking about it
being, like, a full turn

09:56.840 --> 09:58.569
and it really
should be more like...

10:00.480 --> 10:01.641
I think I was just trying...

10:01.800 --> 10:04.770
If I just keep it going from there...

10:04.920 --> 10:06.126
- Yeah, that's fine.
- ls that okay?

10:06.280 --> 10:07.611
- Yeah.
- Like, step, step.

10:07.760 --> 10:11.048
Yeah, because what I'm trying to do
is here, and then I have to...

10:11.240 --> 10:13.891
I think that's cool.
I don't think I've ever seen that,

10:14.400 --> 10:16.846
- which is good.
- Yeah.

10:41.000 --> 10:43.287
- Good.
- I was a little late.

10:43.600 --> 10:46.922
Just make sure this saute',

10:47.400 --> 10:50.131
after we do this turn,
the fourth...

10:50.320 --> 10:51.924
- Justin.
- Yeah.

10:52.080 --> 10:53.800
- Can we give her a five?
- Oh, yeah. Sorry.

10:53.920 --> 10:55.046
Oh, that's fine.

10:55.200 --> 10:57.487
- It's just been an hour.
- Yeah.

10:57.640 --> 10:59.881
- It's okay. Thanks.
- So it's like the boys, Justin.

11:00.040 --> 11:01.560
- If we stay like this...
- Yeah, yeah.

11:01.600 --> 11:02.761
It's like what you said to the boys.

11:02.880 --> 11:04.200
It's like a... It's a theme step.

11:04.280 --> 11:05.361
I understand,
because it breaks up...

11:05.560 --> 11:06.800
It should always be,
like, sometimes Amar,

11:06.960 --> 11:09.360
he gets a little tired at...
you know, after the pas de deux,

11:09.520 --> 11:12.967
when he finishes here...

11:13.120 --> 11:14.201
Oh, yeah.

11:14.400 --> 11:16.050
And he brisées to there,

11:16.200 --> 11:17.725
sometimes he gets really, like,

11:17.880 --> 11:20.406
loose in his arms,
so keep an eye on him.

11:20.560 --> 11:23.040
Okay.
I'll keep my eye on Amar.

11:23.240 --> 11:25.163
I will, most definitely.

11:25.320 --> 11:26.560
Okay, I'm gonna get some water.

11:26.600 --> 11:28.648
Cameron, bravo!

12:05.600 --> 12:08.126
I just heard him say,
"One, two, three, four, five, six.

12:08.280 --> 12:09.884
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight."

12:10.080 --> 12:11.366
Oh, he did?
Oh, okay.

12:11.520 --> 12:12.681
I was just counting slow.

12:12.840 --> 12:14.330
Okay. I'll count slow.

12:14.480 --> 12:15.606
So you just count it
as an eight.

12:15.760 --> 12:17.444
- Yeah.
- A slow eight. Okay.

12:20.480 --> 12:21.811
I want you to turn.

12:21.960 --> 12:24.008
Maybe if you kept her
on her leg.

12:24.160 --> 12:25.764
So if you came back

12:25.920 --> 12:27.490
and you came up,

12:27.680 --> 12:30.331
sous-sous,
and then turned her somehow.

12:30.520 --> 12:32.170
- Okay.
- I don't know.

12:36.840 --> 12:38.080
Sorry.

12:40.680 --> 12:41.841
Sorry.

12:42.680 --> 12:44.091
He kept me on the side of him.

12:44.280 --> 12:45.520
- On the side?
- Yeah.

12:45.680 --> 12:47.569
- Of this side or that side?
- That side.

12:54.200 --> 12:56.043
Forget it.
Go...

12:58.240 --> 13:01.130
...up ...dip.

13:01.280 --> 13:06.286
Bring the leg up through
to extend out.

13:07.320 --> 13:10.244
For you. So you'll go back.
You're in fifth.

13:10.440 --> 13:13.489
Bring the right leg up through passe',
and then step out.

13:14.120 --> 13:15.121
That's it.

13:15.280 --> 13:16.441
Okay.

13:21.400 --> 13:22.890
One, two, three,
four, five, six.

14:17.680 --> 14:19.330
Ah!

14:19.480 --> 14:20.606
Close.
That was good, though.

14:20.720 --> 14:22.165
It's almost like
you need one more step, huh?

14:22.320 --> 14:23.924
- Yeah.
- You need one more step,

14:24.080 --> 14:25.161
do you think?

14:25.520 --> 14:27.840
I think what it is, too,
I have to have distance.

14:27.880 --> 14:29.450
- Yeah.
- If I'm too close to you

14:29.560 --> 14:32.530
when I kick my leg,
I don't... I won't ever get flat.

14:32.680 --> 14:33.727
Like, I almost
have to give him my...

14:33.880 --> 14:34.881
Yeah.

14:35.000 --> 14:36.200
I have to be a little further.

14:36.240 --> 14:37.366
Or maybe I can move back.

14:37.480 --> 14:38.811
Or something. Yeah.

14:38.880 --> 14:40.484
- You can always adjust.
- Yeah. I'll pull back.

14:40.600 --> 14:41.806
- It's totally fine.
- If I'm too...

14:41.920 --> 14:43.160
- Yeah, if I'm too close...
- Let's try that.

14:43.240 --> 14:44.480
I'd rather be a little further.

14:44.520 --> 14:46.240
That was good, though,
up until... I mean...

14:46.280 --> 14:48.282
The timing was great.
It's very musical.

14:48.440 --> 14:50.681
- Cool. Can we try it from the...
- I mean, do you want to try it?

14:50.840 --> 14:52.080
- Yeah, from the repeat?
- Yeah.

14:52.240 --> 14:53.480
Yeah, let's...

14:53.600 --> 14:54.601
Cameron.

14:54.720 --> 14:56.840
Cam, we could do this
with you, yeah, I think.

15:06.960 --> 15:08.371
Okay, Mike. That's good.

15:08.520 --> 15:10.329
Eric, we can do the ground row.

15:13.360 --> 15:15.010
Did you give <i>spots</i> their colors?

15:15.160 --> 15:19.085
I told Penny this morning
51/55 for the bridge,

15:19.200 --> 15:20.690
but I didn't say anything
for the front, but...

15:20.840 --> 15:22.001
Good,
because Thor is here outside.

15:22.080 --> 15:23.440
Okay.
That'd be good.

15:23.560 --> 15:25.085
<i>You want anything
other than 51 and 55?</i>

15:25.240 --> 15:26.605
Not now.

15:35.040 --> 15:39.045
I think both of them have to go
towards soft just a little more.

15:42.320 --> 15:43.560
That's it.

15:46.760 --> 15:48.569
And the first one too.

15:50.880 --> 15:52.723
<i>Are you good everywhere else?</i>

15:53.440 --> 15:54.771
<i>Yeah.</i>

15:54.920 --> 15:56.365
That's it.

15:56.880 --> 15:57.881
Okay. Good.

16:02.480 --> 16:05.165
If you cued the music
and not the dance,

16:05.360 --> 16:07.567
you'd have a lot of light cues.

16:07.720 --> 16:09.006
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

16:09.160 --> 16:10.525
So... because there's just
so many changes

16:10.680 --> 16:12.250
in dynamics and tempo
and all of that,

16:12.400 --> 16:15.404
so we just want to be sure

16:15.560 --> 16:18.450
that we support
what you're doing

16:18.600 --> 16:21.683
and not, sort of, overburden it

16:21.840 --> 16:25.367
with too many other metaphors,
I guess.

16:25.800 --> 16:28.485
Yeah, and I think
because there's already so much

16:28.640 --> 16:30.324
structurally
with the choreography,

16:30.480 --> 16:32.960
I think it's okay
for that to kind of, like,

16:33.120 --> 16:35.771
stand on its own
in certain cases.

16:36.480 --> 16:38.244
It's hard for me to picture
in my head,

16:38.400 --> 16:40.448
because sometimes I'll, like,

16:42.240 --> 16:44.527
talk about
sort of lighting aspects,

16:44.680 --> 16:48.526
and in my head, it's much more
extreme than I think.

16:48.680 --> 16:51.490
And then we get...
You know, we get down there,

16:51.640 --> 16:55.804
and it's, like, ten percent
of what I thought it would be...

16:55.960 --> 16:57.610
in a good way,
you know what I mean?

16:57.760 --> 17:00.001
Like, I'm like, "Oh,
that's actually really nice,

17:00.200 --> 17:03.010
andifs, Hke,
it enhances everything,

17:03.160 --> 17:05.970
and it's not like,
an obvious thing," so...

17:06.520 --> 17:08.647
It's how far
do we push those moments

17:08.839 --> 17:14.324
of narrative into a story
with the light?

17:14.480 --> 17:16.368
- I see what you mean.
- And that's one of the things...

17:16.520 --> 17:18.010
And we don't have
to answer that right now.

17:18.160 --> 17:19.888
It's just things
for us to think and talk about.

17:20.040 --> 17:21.371
Yeah.

17:23.119 --> 17:25.881
Where are the... Actually,
where are we with the pas de trois?

17:26.000 --> 17:28.526
Okay.
That's fine.

17:29.560 --> 17:33.406
I want to place you guys,
but I'm not sure where yet.

17:42.520 --> 17:43.521
Yeah.

17:50.080 --> 17:51.081
Yeah.

17:56.880 --> 17:59.008
- I like lower than...
- We've noticed.

17:59.160 --> 18:01.845
Just because I feel like
I don't have, like,

18:02.000 --> 18:04.287
such a long neck,
so the more things come up,

18:04.440 --> 18:05.646
I feel like it...

18:05.800 --> 18:07.370
- Short, like, makes you...
- Yeah.

18:07.560 --> 18:09.085
- Okay.
- Then how do you feel about, like,

18:09.240 --> 18:11.049
where things are cut here
on you?

18:11.200 --> 18:12.804
- Doesn't matter?
- Whatever. Yeah.

18:12.960 --> 18:14.883
Like, old-fashioned
bathing suit cut

18:15.040 --> 18:16.565
is something
that we're talking about.

18:16.720 --> 18:19.166
- Oh.
- Romper.

18:19.400 --> 18:22.210
I love rompers.
I wear them all the time.

18:22.360 --> 18:23.930
Daily.

18:24.600 --> 18:25.601
Um...

18:25.760 --> 18:27.762
What other things
were we thinking about for her?

18:27.960 --> 18:29.962
Just as long as my legs
don't look short.

18:30.120 --> 18:31.804
No, no, no.

18:32.000 --> 18:33.923
We'll give you a high waist
or something.

18:34.080 --> 18:36.811
- Yes.
- We'll make you look so long.

18:37.000 --> 18:38.001
Um...

18:38.200 --> 18:39.531
And then as far as...

18:39.720 --> 18:41.324
How do you feel about...

18:41.480 --> 18:43.608
I don't know if this matters;
I'm not a dancer, but...

18:43.760 --> 18:46.240
dancing with something
that's kind of loose?

18:46.400 --> 18:47.526
- A sash.
- A sash.

18:47.680 --> 18:49.125
So it'll move around.

18:49.280 --> 18:51.089
We can always try it,
and if it doesn't...

18:51.240 --> 18:52.571
I don't have
anything against it.

18:52.720 --> 18:55.246
- Okay.
- You know, if it... Maybe the boys

18:55.440 --> 18:57.010
will say something
with partnering.

18:57.160 --> 18:58.491
- Right.
- But for me, I'm...

18:58.640 --> 18:59.971
- You're okay.
- I'm okay with it.

19:00.120 --> 19:01.167
- Okay.
- Yeah.

19:01.280 --> 19:02.327
Okay.

21:53.160 --> 21:54.321
Okay.

21:54.480 --> 21:57.450
- Justin, I just have one question.
- Yeah.

21:57.600 --> 21:59.125
You know, when we bourrée back
for the girls,

21:59.280 --> 22:00.327
we're <i>bourréeing</i> back...

22:00.480 --> 22:01.970
they don't know
if they should finish here...

22:02.120 --> 22:03.201
Because, you see,
some finish here,

22:03.360 --> 22:04.566
as the original step you gave,

22:04.760 --> 22:06.922
and some
are already going parallel,

22:07.080 --> 22:08.081
so should we just...

22:08.240 --> 22:09.844
Oh.
No, they should finish it out.

22:10.000 --> 22:11.411
Girls, right? Okay?

22:11.600 --> 22:13.602
Because some people
are going parallel already

22:13.760 --> 22:16.001
because you see the boys
coming there without finishing.

22:16.160 --> 22:17.241
Just finish it out.

22:17.440 --> 22:18.646
Don't let the boys
make you nervous.

22:18.800 --> 22:20.450
- Totally.
- Okay.

22:22.840 --> 22:24.604
As far as the pointe shoes go,

22:24.760 --> 22:26.440
would you want them to, like,
pancake nude,

22:26.520 --> 22:28.682
or do you want to keep, like,
City Ballet...

22:28.840 --> 22:30.410
- Well, it's up to you.
- Freed pink?

22:30.520 --> 22:32.720
- What do you want?
- We didn't...

22:32.840 --> 22:34.960
We could talk to the girls
and see what they want too.

22:35.080 --> 22:36.720
They can... I mean,
they'll do whatever...

22:36.800 --> 22:39.451
I mean, whatever we want.
I mean, there's all sorts of ballets

22:39.600 --> 22:41.682
where they have to alter
the shoe color,

22:41.880 --> 22:43.882
so it's not an issue.

22:44.040 --> 22:45.246
Great.

22:45.520 --> 22:49.127
And we really, initially,
wanted texture in knits,

22:49.280 --> 22:51.248
but we realized that dancers

22:51.400 --> 22:56.406
probably don't want to wear,
like, hot cashmere.

22:56.600 --> 22:58.011
Cashmere!

22:58.160 --> 23:00.561
I mean, we're used
to wearing really hot,

23:00.720 --> 23:02.165
uncomfortable costumes,

23:02.320 --> 23:04.402
and this will be nothing
compared to some...

23:04.560 --> 23:07.530
Like, we wear Firebird
monster costumes.

23:07.680 --> 23:08.761
- I love them.
- Yeah.

23:08.920 --> 23:10.001
Yeah, and they're great,

23:10.200 --> 23:11.850
but they're not fun to wear.

23:12.000 --> 23:14.970
- But we still wear them, so...
- Okay.

23:15.160 --> 23:17.766
So if you really like that,
then stick with it.

25:11.440 --> 25:16.401
Five, six. Two, two, three,
four, five, six.

25:16.560 --> 25:19.848
Three, two, three,
four, five, six.

25:20.000 --> 25:24.050
Four, two, three,
four, five, six.

25:24.200 --> 25:27.647
Five, two, three,
four, five, six.

25:27.800 --> 25:32.488
Six, two, three,
four, five, six.

25:32.640 --> 25:35.564
One, two, three, one...

25:35.760 --> 25:37.205
See?
There is a one-two-three.

25:37.360 --> 25:39.010
Well, the one-two-three
was a silent,

25:39.160 --> 25:40.960
but if you want it on that,
it can be on that.

25:41.080 --> 25:42.889
I thought the one...
the silent one-two-three,

25:43.040 --> 25:44.530
we're going to this.

25:44.680 --> 25:46.800
His six that
he's counting is our sixth six.

25:46.880 --> 25:48.769
- Let's just do our sixth six.
- It's four, five, six.

25:48.920 --> 25:50.840
- One, two, three, I think.
- Two or three. Yeah.

25:50.920 --> 25:52.649
- Okay.
- Okay. Cool.

25:52.800 --> 25:54.768
So we'll count the six and go
on the silent one-two-three and go.

25:54.920 --> 25:56.922
Okay. Last six.

26:09.480 --> 26:11.164
Okay.
Good.

26:12.120 --> 26:16.011
And can you each
just support his back?

26:17.160 --> 26:19.970
If we both did
maybe, like, a fourth.

26:20.120 --> 26:22.327
We can just try that.
And go!

26:24.160 --> 26:26.322
- Oh, God.
- I know. I'm heavy.

26:26.520 --> 26:28.360
No, it's just because
he ends up going sideways

26:28.480 --> 26:30.642
- and we're trying to do it...
- Oh, do you want me to go to you?

26:30.800 --> 26:32.086
- Yeah, you need to...
- Go to Sterling.

26:32.280 --> 26:34.040
- That's fine. I didn't know.
- Okay.

26:36.240 --> 26:37.685
You can come a little more to me.

26:37.840 --> 26:39.569
- I'm scared now.
- Just don't be flat.

26:39.760 --> 26:42.286
- Can you split the difference?
- Split the difference. Okay.

26:45.400 --> 26:46.481
- Perfect.
- Got you.

26:46.640 --> 26:48.165
- That's great.
- Wow, ladies!

26:48.320 --> 26:49.924
Let's try that.

26:50.720 --> 26:52.165
Okay, let's do...
I think we should

26:52.320 --> 26:54.209
run the finale step,
since that's brand-new.

26:54.360 --> 26:55.725
What do we think?

26:55.920 --> 26:57.360
Let's go over it.
Let's hear it once.

26:57.520 --> 26:58.646
Let's hear it once.

26:58.840 --> 27:00.126
And...

27:00.320 --> 27:03.688
One, two, three, four, five, six.
One, two, three, four.

27:09.840 --> 27:13.128
One, two, three, four,
five, six. One, two.

27:14.880 --> 27:16.006
Stop.

27:16.160 --> 27:17.924
Yes! Yes!

27:18.080 --> 27:21.687
Sterling... She did it.
She's got it.

27:21.840 --> 27:23.365
Sorry.

27:23.520 --> 27:27.081
It needs to be...
It's not, like, crispy enough.

27:27.280 --> 27:30.250
- Crispier?
- Crispier, okay? Same thing.

27:35.000 --> 27:37.651
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven.

27:37.840 --> 27:40.844
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

27:41.000 --> 27:43.287
One, two, three, four, five...

28:04.080 --> 28:05.889
Okay.
Three and...

28:14.480 --> 28:15.891
That's it!
Good.

29:01.360 --> 29:02.885
Good!
Good!

29:56.600 --> 29:59.604
That was very, very, very good.
That was very good.

30:00.160 --> 30:02.208
That's what I'm looking for.

30:03.640 --> 30:05.290
That's what I'm looking for.

30:09.440 --> 30:11.283
It's like the balance
of these is off.

30:11.480 --> 30:12.527
Mm-hmm.

30:14.360 --> 30:16.360
It's not just a matter
of pulling that part, is it?

30:16.480 --> 30:17.606
No.

30:17.760 --> 30:19.120
Yeah.
I know what you mean, though.

30:19.240 --> 30:23.484
Because this
is all just falling forward.

30:24.320 --> 30:27.290
And we want it to sit, like...

30:27.440 --> 30:28.771
- Like that.
- More like that.

30:28.920 --> 30:29.967
That's better.

30:30.120 --> 30:33.124
So if you take the waistband off
and remove some length here,

30:33.280 --> 30:35.203
would that, like,
put a deeper curve?

30:35.360 --> 30:36.805
It would. Yeah.

30:36.960 --> 30:39.247
I mean, we basically know what
we need to do to make it do that.

30:39.440 --> 30:40.521
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

30:40.680 --> 30:43.570
We can't really do it right now,
but it's a pretty easy alteration.

30:43.720 --> 30:45.529
I trust that the fit
will resolve itself.

30:45.680 --> 30:48.126
But yeah.
I like it very much.

30:50.520 --> 30:53.490
Are we worried about this fabric
getting super pilly?

30:54.360 --> 30:55.521
Well...

30:56.360 --> 30:59.091
I mean, I like
that it has texture.

30:59.240 --> 31:00.526
Right.

31:00.800 --> 31:02.564
Um...

31:03.200 --> 31:05.248
It may. Yes.

31:06.000 --> 31:08.367
But then that's what we also
have a wardrobe department for.

31:08.520 --> 31:09.931
Wow. That's amazing.

31:20.360 --> 31:21.930
Stop!

31:22.960 --> 31:24.689
We need to do that again.

31:25.840 --> 31:29.447
Just, we're forgetting stuff,
and I think... Joe's new.

31:29.600 --> 31:31.284
And, Apple, you still got late.

31:31.440 --> 31:32.930
- Sorry, Albert.
- It's okay.

31:33.120 --> 31:36.886
Make the first lifts
more efficient, okay?

31:37.080 --> 31:41.369
The first, like, when she's just
in sixth or fifth or whatever,

31:41.520 --> 31:43.090
okay?

31:43.720 --> 31:47.122
Like, really contained, okay?

31:47.280 --> 31:49.248
You have to lift her up
and lift her down.

31:49.400 --> 31:50.765
- Yeah.
- Not just lift her up.

31:50.920 --> 31:53.002
Yeah, don't just drop her, okay?

31:53.360 --> 31:55.840
Pick her up,
and put her down in a new spot.

31:58.360 --> 31:59.646
Okay.
One more time.

32:27.560 --> 32:28.721
That's better.

32:40.160 --> 32:41.241
Good.

33:05.720 --> 33:07.529
The bump can be
a little more dramatic.

33:07.680 --> 33:10.081
It's starting to lose its intensity.

33:14.520 --> 33:16.090
It's like they know
it's coming now, you know?

33:16.240 --> 33:17.446
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

33:20.080 --> 33:23.607
- Joe has to do tree-frog fingers...
- Okay.

33:24.040 --> 33:25.929
Before the boys' dance starts.

33:37.560 --> 33:40.530
Ster, in that pirouette,
it's a pancake moment.

33:40.680 --> 33:44.480
Yeah, Sterling and Amar,
there's just always this weird...

33:44.640 --> 33:46.369
- Like, a pancake moment.
- After you do here...

33:46.520 --> 33:48.090
I don't know what that is.

33:48.240 --> 33:49.651
It takes a moment to get
out of it, for some reason.

33:49.840 --> 33:51.046
Because you're
on one... on both legs?

33:51.200 --> 33:52.840
It shouldn't be, though.
It's very simple.

33:53.400 --> 33:54.845
Well, pointe shoes are different.

33:58.000 --> 33:59.843
So wait, is it because
I'm giving her too much force?

34:00.000 --> 34:02.002
- Is that what the problem is?
- Maybe. I think maybe a little less.

34:02.160 --> 34:03.685
- Because I'm doing this.
- Yeah.

34:04.120 --> 34:05.690
Maybe that's what it is.

34:05.840 --> 34:08.161
Why don't you soutenu
and come down after?

34:08.440 --> 34:10.204
Whichever...
whatever you want.

34:10.400 --> 34:11.525
What do you mean?

34:15.280 --> 34:16.770
Do you want... you want
to come down before?

34:16.920 --> 34:17.920
Is that better?

34:20.000 --> 34:23.083
Let's do a normal soutenu.
That was good.

34:23.239 --> 34:24.571
- Yeah.
- That was nice.

34:24.719 --> 34:26.882
- Sometimes if I get too much...
- Yeah, it can...

34:27.080 --> 34:28.679
I mean, I don't need very much.

34:28.719 --> 34:30.210
I know, you remember,
you told me to do that, but...

34:30.360 --> 34:31.840
I think I just need some
to get going.

34:31.920 --> 34:33.284
- Because I can do the rest.
- Cool. Absolutely.

34:33.440 --> 34:34.960
Just because
I'm in such a dead moment.

34:35.000 --> 34:36.842
- I'll, I'll... yup.
- Okay.

34:37.000 --> 34:39.685
And, Joe, when you go
to the floor for the...

34:39.840 --> 34:41.251
Can I see it?

34:41.600 --> 34:42.840
I'm doing that.

34:43.000 --> 34:44.161
More spread.

34:44.440 --> 34:46.248
Okay, you need to work
on your finger flexibility.

34:46.400 --> 34:48.368
No, it's fine.

34:48.560 --> 34:49.766
Wait, do you want them,
like, domed?

34:49.920 --> 34:51.649
- Is that what you're...
- Maybe domed.

34:51.800 --> 34:53.085
No, don't dome them.

34:53.239 --> 34:54.605
It should be like...

34:55.639 --> 34:58.246
- Okay.
- Oh. I see.

34:58.400 --> 34:59.640
Maybe like that, yeah.

34:59.800 --> 35:01.086
So they're splayed
a little more.

35:01.280 --> 35:02.680
- Okay.
- Yeah. That's good.

35:02.720 --> 35:04.927
- Okay.
- Sterli... Sterl.

35:05.120 --> 35:06.884
Oh, she needs to do more
with her back leg.

35:07.080 --> 35:09.447
Ster, we want to have you
one more time in the <i>grand jeté.</i>

35:09.600 --> 35:10.647
Okay.

35:10.800 --> 35:12.440
In the grand jeté,
the toss thing.

35:17.080 --> 35:18.920
I feel like you're
a little late, just, like...

35:18.960 --> 35:20.371
- I feel like you're behind her.
- Yeah.

35:20.520 --> 35:21.521
- Okay.
- Yeah.

35:21.720 --> 35:24.644
I feel like she's already past you,
and you can't get any...

35:24.800 --> 35:25.961
Okay.

35:28.480 --> 35:29.641
- That's better.
- Oh, hey.

35:29.800 --> 35:30.926
- That was better.
- Yeah.

35:31.080 --> 35:32.809
- I just need to travel with you.
- She needs to be...

35:32.960 --> 35:34.769
If you think about her being
almost slightly behind you

35:34.920 --> 35:37.280
- so you can really, like...
- Can I try one more time?

35:41.320 --> 35:42.606
- Yeah!
- That's great.

35:42.760 --> 35:43.886
- That's it.
- Good.

35:48.880 --> 35:51.042
<i>Iris 619 at half, please.</i>

35:51.200 --> 35:52.804
<i>670.</i>

35:53.280 --> 35:56.443
<i>No. Oops. 651 at 50.</i>

35:56.600 --> 35:59.331
<i>Come back to N1 once it's clear.</i>

35:59.480 --> 36:03.405
<i>No, you're fine.
Just give me 370. Right.</i>

36:04.800 --> 36:08.361
And update cue 12.
Cue only.

36:10.200 --> 36:11.680
<i>And stand by, bridge,</i>

36:11.760 --> 36:13.649
<i>to pick up the couple
down right...</i>

36:13.800 --> 36:14.847
or down left with cue ten.

36:15.000 --> 36:16.764
You'll come up to half minus.

36:17.160 --> 36:21.051
And then stand by, stage right,
to switch our dancers here...

36:21.600 --> 36:23.967
or to switch our light walkers.

36:24.440 --> 36:27.011
If, by chance,
sorry, before you start,

36:27.200 --> 36:29.089
that I don't have their marks...

36:29.240 --> 36:30.605
- Hold please, Katie.
- Yup.

36:30.760 --> 36:33.604
If I don't have their marks slightly
right, can that be adjusted?

36:33.760 --> 36:35.603
Like, I'm worried that they're
gonna end up a little...

36:35.760 --> 36:36.921
- Oh, absolutely.
- Okay.

36:37.080 --> 36:38.366
- Yeah.
- That's not hard to fix.

36:38.520 --> 36:40.602
- Easy fix.
- All right.

36:40.800 --> 36:42.040
Cool. All right.

36:42.200 --> 36:43.680
Bridge, stand by
to pick up the couple

36:43.760 --> 36:45.410
with cue ten, half minus,

36:45.560 --> 36:48.928
and stand by, Penny, to switch
the light walkers, please.

36:49.080 --> 36:51.811
All right, so applause,
applause, applause.

36:51.960 --> 36:54.247
Light cue ten, go.

36:55.040 --> 36:56.405
So add some beginning applause.

36:56.560 --> 36:58.210
Bridge, slowly
picking up the couple.

37:15.600 --> 37:17.045
So 16, go.

37:26.760 --> 37:28.285
And they're now moving.

37:31.800 --> 37:33.848
And the whole stage gets
a little brighter

37:34.000 --> 37:35.445
and fuller at that point.

37:39.640 --> 37:42.530
<i>Light cue 14, go.</i>

37:44.160 --> 37:46.128
Another thing I was wondering...

37:46.800 --> 37:48.320
I don't know if this
would be a bother,

37:48.400 --> 37:50.084
but because
it's so high-waisted...

37:50.840 --> 37:52.171
Can, in the pattern of...

37:52.320 --> 37:54.402
Is this just a half circle?
They're side seams.

37:54.560 --> 37:56.449
Okay, so this is...
This is three pieces?

37:56.640 --> 37:57.641
It's one, two, and three?

37:57.760 --> 37:58.921
- Yes.
- Okay.

37:59.080 --> 38:01.321
Can the sides be, like,
shaped a little bit

38:01.480 --> 38:03.926
to give less fullness in the...

38:04.080 --> 38:05.411
- At the top?
- At the top?

38:05.560 --> 38:07.040
And more flare?
Absolutely. Of course.

38:07.400 --> 38:08.840
Yeah, because that way,
we'll lose...

38:08.960 --> 38:10.644
When she twirls,
it won't get so far away

38:10.800 --> 38:13.121
from her body here,
but it will here.

38:13.280 --> 38:14.327
- Yeah.
- Okay.

38:14.560 --> 38:15.925
Yeah,
so it will just be slightly

38:16.080 --> 38:17.650
more angled and slightly shaped.

38:17.800 --> 38:19.848
Right, not just
a straight line from the... right.

38:20.000 --> 38:21.161
Okay.

38:23.320 --> 38:25.004
- And she'll have...
- Does it feel comfortable?

38:25.160 --> 38:26.161
- It feels great.
- Good.

38:26.360 --> 38:27.361
She'll have...

38:27.520 --> 38:28.806
I mean, this really does
feel secure.

38:28.960 --> 38:29.961
Little trunks to match?

38:30.160 --> 38:31.366
- Okay.
- Yeah.

38:35.480 --> 38:37.528
What happened
with the rolling down?

38:39.240 --> 38:41.402
Yeah, with the straight here,
front, roll down.

38:41.560 --> 38:43.961
Oh. Sorry.

38:44.120 --> 38:46.009
And then can you take her more off?

38:46.320 --> 38:48.971
Off, back, off.

38:49.160 --> 38:52.084
For this développé, down.

38:52.200 --> 38:54.601
And then when you switch,
for that pas de chat,

38:54.760 --> 38:56.762
can you straighten the left leg
so it goes

38:56.920 --> 38:59.082
up, switch,
and then you hold passe'?

38:59.240 --> 39:00.241
Okay.

39:00.440 --> 39:04.411
But bend the left leg
and then switch.

39:05.040 --> 39:07.407
Bring the arms in
and then around that way.

39:08.240 --> 39:09.321
Let me see.

39:11.200 --> 39:13.931
No.
Here, bring them down,

39:14.120 --> 39:16.043
through,
and then around that way.

39:16.200 --> 39:18.567
No.
Here, bring them down...

39:18.720 --> 39:21.166
- Oh.
- Up, through, and around.

39:21.520 --> 39:25.445
No.
Here, bring the arms in.

39:25.800 --> 39:28.644
Now open the elbows and up.

39:29.120 --> 39:30.167
Okay.

39:30.320 --> 39:31.810
- I'll get it.
- Close.

39:32.520 --> 39:36.650
Here. Elbows open. There.

39:38.200 --> 39:39.929
That's it.
Try it one more time.

39:42.600 --> 39:45.410
Show the... You need
to isolate the elbows

39:45.560 --> 39:47.210
coming out and around.

39:49.760 --> 39:50.921
No.

39:51.360 --> 39:52.646
From here...

39:55.680 --> 39:57.648
Turn the shoulders sooner.

39:58.440 --> 39:59.771
Let's try it again.

40:00.120 --> 40:02.521
Five, six, seven, eight.
Go, one.

40:33.640 --> 40:34.721
Mm-hmm.

40:35.440 --> 40:36.771
No, it's not bad, actually.

40:40.360 --> 40:41.880
<i>They're gonna tack these down</i>.

40:42.040 --> 40:43.610
<i>I want these to be in,
like, my spring wardrobe.</i>

40:43.760 --> 40:44.841
<i>Yeah.</i>

40:45.040 --> 40:46.371
It's so cute.
I would wear that.

40:46.520 --> 40:48.124
Mine feels...
Mine's doing a little...

40:48.280 --> 40:49.406
It's expected. Yeah.

40:49.560 --> 40:50.971
Are people
still getting changed?

40:51.120 --> 40:52.167
No. This is it.

40:52.320 --> 40:53.800
Okay.
Can we come out onstage?

40:53.840 --> 40:55.285
Girl, you got
nothing to worry about.

40:55.440 --> 40:57.602
Yeah, if it comes out,
it's cute.

40:57.760 --> 40:59.091
Shit.

41:01.880 --> 41:02.961
I love it.

41:10.320 --> 41:11.640
Andy, if you could cue...

41:11.760 --> 41:13.444
Wait till the lights
completely change...

41:13.600 --> 41:15.284
- Andy Okay.
- ...before you cue the music.

41:16.080 --> 41:18.048
Uh... One more time.

41:23.760 --> 41:25.171
I think it's too dark.

41:25.240 --> 41:26.321
Mm-hmm.

41:26.880 --> 41:28.723
Can we make a note to tell Mark?

41:30.200 --> 41:31.361
I, like, can't even see Amar.

41:31.520 --> 41:34.330
I know. Totally.
I just noticed that.

41:37.920 --> 41:40.207
Oh, my God.
I can't see a thing.

42:51.440 --> 42:54.284
- And you fixed...
- Kind of.

42:54.440 --> 42:55.566
- Kind of.
- Yes.

42:55.760 --> 42:56.841
Well...

42:57.000 --> 42:58.331
- The toss was good.
- It's okay.

42:58.480 --> 43:00.528
It's just... yeah.

43:00.720 --> 43:02.404
We're just crossed.
We need to just...

43:02.480 --> 43:04.244
- I think what we're gonna do...
- If this is okay with you...

43:04.400 --> 43:05.970
Forjust the second one,
if it's okay with you,

43:06.120 --> 43:08.646
for here,
I'm not gonna use this arm.

43:08.800 --> 43:10.131
Is that okay,
that he doesn't take this arm?

43:10.280 --> 43:12.169
- Yeah, that's fine.
- Because I think what's happening is

43:12.360 --> 43:13.725
I'm getting really twisted.

43:13.880 --> 43:15.000
Oh, and that's why you fall.

43:15.120 --> 43:16.929
All right, well, let's try that
tomorrow. And I'll look at it.

43:17.040 --> 43:19.040
- See if you like it.
- And tell us what you think.

43:19.440 --> 43:22.603
Harriet and Marc?

43:24.440 --> 43:26.124
So you want to see his body more?

43:26.280 --> 43:28.248
I also feel like,
when I see him from far away,

43:28.400 --> 43:30.164
I think,
also because of his body

43:30.320 --> 43:32.971
and how he looks, that, like,

43:33.120 --> 43:36.841
it all feels very high, like...

43:37.000 --> 43:38.923
I don't know, maybe
around the neck or something.

43:39.080 --> 43:40.206
Just feels like...

43:40.360 --> 43:41.725
A little too, like, up...

43:41.880 --> 43:43.291
- Too, like, up here.
- Up here?

43:43.440 --> 43:44.680
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

43:44.880 --> 43:46.723
Because I have
less down here, probably.

43:46.880 --> 43:49.690
- Do we open up the neckline?
- Maybe that opens just a touch.

43:49.840 --> 43:51.046
Do you think
we can go in on the...

43:51.200 --> 43:52.565
- We could do that too.
- Yeah.

43:52.720 --> 43:54.160
For his arms
so he doesn't look so...

43:54.240 --> 43:55.730
- Did you fold that in?
- Yeah, you folded that in.

43:55.880 --> 43:57.962
And then do we
open this up more?

43:58.800 --> 44:00.643
- And maybe take a little bit.
- I think that would be nice.

44:00.800 --> 44:02.928
Because then you could see his
neck and his chest a little bit.

44:03.160 --> 44:04.286
Neck and your arms.

44:04.480 --> 44:06.080
Yeah, because
then we could do this, too.

44:06.160 --> 44:08.447
We can just get this
a little more...

44:08.600 --> 44:09.726
Yeah.

44:09.880 --> 44:11.166
Yeah, that already
looks better to me.

44:11.320 --> 44:12.446
Okay.

44:13.040 --> 44:15.646
I'm not as part of the
dance world as you guys are.

44:15.840 --> 44:17.842
Yeah.
I was like, "Wow. The legs."

44:18.000 --> 44:19.843
- Like, you know.
- Too short?

44:20.000 --> 44:22.731
Yeah, but Marc was also saying, like,
"Oh, they've worn less."

44:22.880 --> 44:24.530
No, that's...
That is, like...

44:24.720 --> 44:28.122
It's better to see more leg
just from a dance point of view.

44:28.280 --> 44:29.361
Right.

44:29.560 --> 44:30.686
Like, the lines will be much better.

44:30.840 --> 44:33.241
- Okay.
- And plus, they all have great legs.

44:33.440 --> 44:35.568
- I think it's... It'll be fine.
- Okay. Okay, good.

44:35.760 --> 44:38.366
- Yeah, so...
- Okay. All right.

44:38.520 --> 44:40.807
I think... Yeah, I think
I'm really happy with them.

46:25.600 --> 46:27.250
- Should I take it off and see...
- No, no, no.

46:27.400 --> 46:30.370
Let's get all this done first,
and then we'll figure out the top.

46:30.520 --> 46:31.851
So let's get you zipped.

46:32.000 --> 46:34.401
But I thought maybe
I stepped into it wrong.

46:34.600 --> 46:35.965
How's that possible?

46:36.120 --> 46:37.804
Because there was
a lot of things going on.

46:39.600 --> 46:41.648
Is Marc Happel here?

46:43.320 --> 46:46.005
Okay.
Why is it not staying?

46:46.160 --> 46:47.400
Oh, there's a hook.

46:47.560 --> 46:50.166
Okay, you ready? I'm gonna hook you.
Take a deep breath.

46:50.320 --> 46:52.049
- Yeah.
- Okay.

46:52.680 --> 46:56.480
Okay. Then this goes down.

46:57.240 --> 46:59.368
This goes here.

46:59.760 --> 47:01.444
Let's get hooked.

47:01.600 --> 47:03.250
I'm gonna hook before I snap.

47:07.920 --> 47:09.763
Okay. Then...

47:10.520 --> 47:11.646
There was a hook.

47:11.800 --> 47:13.404
- There is a hook up here.
- But...

47:13.640 --> 47:15.130
I'm gonna hook it right now.
Are you ready?

47:15.280 --> 47:16.281
- Yeah.
- You're in.

47:16.440 --> 47:17.601
- Yeah. I am?
- We nailed it.

47:17.760 --> 47:18.886
It looks right?

48:10.080 --> 48:11.684
And Joe turned the wrong way.

48:11.840 --> 48:13.171
Okay.

48:31.720 --> 48:34.724
Tiler's solo at the end
of the first movement.

48:34.960 --> 48:39.443
I felt like the backdrop
and her costume were identical.

48:39.640 --> 48:42.166
So I want to play
a little more with that.

48:42.320 --> 48:45.164
The tricky part is,
if you separate them,

48:45.320 --> 48:47.926
it feels like the end
of the movement goes down,

48:48.080 --> 48:49.491
because it gets darker,

48:49.640 --> 48:51.768
you know,
by making a richer back...

48:51.920 --> 48:53.809
So I've fussed with it
a little bit,

48:53.960 --> 48:55.883
and we'll do some more
on Tuesday and Wednesday.

48:56.040 --> 48:59.567
But the second movement,
you were happier with that?

48:59.720 --> 49:01.080
- I'm really happy with it.
- Okay.

49:01.120 --> 49:02.121
- Yeah, yeah.
- Good.

49:11.200 --> 49:12.406
Here.

49:13.120 --> 49:15.122
Can it come down a little
tempo-wise, or no?

49:15.280 --> 49:17.647
I can just make sure
that it... that it...

49:17.800 --> 49:20.246
it stays very, very steady.

49:21.440 --> 49:22.680
Yeah.

49:22.840 --> 49:24.251
Yeah, that would be fine.

49:24.440 --> 49:25.930
Tell me what number.

49:26.640 --> 49:27.971
I'm just gonna say it.

49:28.120 --> 49:31.681
My only concern, and it would
have nothing to do with you,

49:31.840 --> 49:33.842
is that it's a lot of look.

49:34.000 --> 49:36.446
There's a lot of, like,
things happening.

49:36.600 --> 49:38.887
So, like, even when the whole
group is doing one thing,

49:39.080 --> 49:42.368
it's... it doesn't become as, like,
solid as it would

49:42.520 --> 49:44.520
- if there was, like, one color.
- It's okay. Yeah.

49:44.600 --> 49:46.364
- Okay.
- As long as you're okay with that.

49:46.520 --> 49:48.090
No, I think
the palette works so well.

49:48.240 --> 49:49.241
Okay.

49:49.400 --> 49:52.927
And it's...
I like the variety a lot.

49:53.080 --> 49:54.844
- Okay.
- Especially, like...

49:55.000 --> 49:56.968
The last piece I did
was so uniform.

49:57.120 --> 49:58.281
- Very.
- And I don't want...

49:58.440 --> 50:01.205
I don't want to do the same thing
over and over, so it's good.

50:01.360 --> 50:03.283
- Okay. Yay!
- Yeah. Thanks.

50:07.760 --> 50:11.128
This is really bad right here,

50:11.320 --> 50:13.891
- and it, like, hurts to point.
- Okay.

50:14.040 --> 50:15.565
I don't know.
No, it's, like, in here.

50:15.720 --> 50:16.960
- More on the inside.
- Okay.

50:17.120 --> 50:19.327
It feels like
it's fused to the bone.

50:21.080 --> 50:23.048
Okay.
You're gonna flex up.

50:25.080 --> 50:27.651
Good. Hold that, and relax.

50:34.680 --> 50:36.967
And it just started today?

50:37.480 --> 50:38.561
I mean...

50:38.760 --> 50:40.640
Has it been starting
to bother you a little bit?

50:40.760 --> 50:42.569
I haven't... I've had a lot...
I don't know.

50:42.720 --> 50:45.849
I've probably
been ignoring it, maybe.

51:20.760 --> 51:23.047
I felt yesterday, probably,
maybe not so much today,

51:23.200 --> 51:25.328
but I felt like today
there was, or yesterday,

51:25.480 --> 51:27.926
there was this disconnect
between what's happening here,

51:28.080 --> 51:29.570
- which is very cool.
- Yeah.

51:29.720 --> 51:32.530
You know, you're doing
a new ballet, a third one, right?

51:33.760 --> 51:36.161
You're kind of this kid...
You know... I mean, it's cool.

51:36.360 --> 51:37.361
- Right?
- Yeah.

51:37.520 --> 51:39.249
But the orchestra's just...
You know,

51:39.400 --> 51:41.368
they weren't immediately
crazy about the piece,

51:41.520 --> 51:44.046
and, you know, it's not...
There's this disconnect

51:44.240 --> 51:46.447
between the excitement
of actually what's happening...

51:46.760 --> 51:47.921
And what it...

51:48.120 --> 51:50.320
The reason I asked about Rabbit
was because if it was...

51:50.360 --> 51:52.488
If you could go down and say,
you know,

51:52.640 --> 51:54.768
"Thank you so much
for yesterday's Rabbit,"

51:54.960 --> 51:56.530
and this is my third...

51:56.680 --> 51:58.091
- You know what I'm saying?
- Yeah.

51:58.240 --> 52:00.527
No, I almost said something
yesterday to them,

52:00.720 --> 52:03.166
but I didn't want to, like,
overstep my boundaries either.

52:03.320 --> 52:05.209
I think if you went
and if you could...

52:05.360 --> 52:06.725
Are you gonna...
You're gonna sit out there?

52:06.880 --> 52:07.927
Yeah.

52:08.080 --> 52:12.369
I think if you went in and just
told Marquerite to wait 30 seconds

52:12.560 --> 52:13.880
and you went to Andy
and you said,

52:13.960 --> 52:15.371
"Do you mind
if I address the orchestra?"

52:15.520 --> 52:17.329
Yeah. Okay.
I can do that.

52:17.480 --> 52:19.289
I mean, I just feel like
you should make the connection.

52:19.440 --> 52:21.329
- Yeah, that's really nice.
- Then they could rally to...

52:21.480 --> 52:23.050
- Yeah.
- They'd feel like, "Yeah, it matters

52:23.240 --> 52:25.129
that we play well,
and it's a big deal."

52:25.760 --> 52:27.603
- Okay.
- You know? I mean... Okay.

52:27.760 --> 52:29.880
Yeah, I appreciate that. Yeah.
No, that's great. Yeah.

52:29.920 --> 52:31.445
I'll do that. Thanks.

52:41.200 --> 52:42.486
Can I just say...

52:42.680 --> 52:44.921
Can I just talk
to the orchestra for a second?

52:45.080 --> 52:46.491
Is that okay?

52:47.000 --> 52:48.809
- Yeah.
- No?

52:49.200 --> 52:51.202
Yeah. Okay.

52:51.360 --> 52:52.566
Okay.

52:53.640 --> 52:54.880
Guys, hi.

52:55.040 --> 52:56.724
I'm the choreographer.
I don't know if I...

52:56.880 --> 52:58.848
If I know all of you,
but I'm Justin Peck.

52:59.160 --> 53:01.367
I just want to say
that my whole process

53:01.520 --> 53:04.205
of choreographing
is really, really, really

53:04.360 --> 53:06.249
based on the music,
and everything I do

53:06.400 --> 53:08.721
is about, sort of, like,
exposing the details

53:08.880 --> 53:12.362
and, like, the complexities
and the textures of the orchestra.

53:12.520 --> 53:14.249
It's really, really important

53:14.400 --> 53:16.721
to play with, like,
a lot of energy and vigor,

53:16.920 --> 53:18.524
especially in this piece.

53:19.080 --> 53:20.889
I would really
appreciate that so much,

53:21.040 --> 53:22.480
and I'm so thrilled
to have you guys.

53:22.600 --> 53:23.886
Sounded great last night.

53:24.040 --> 53:26.088
The string section
in Year of the Rabbit...

53:26.240 --> 53:28.641
I was so happy with it.
Tempos were great and everything.

53:28.840 --> 53:31.320
So, I'm really looking forward
to this premiere and everything.

53:31.520 --> 53:32.681
So merde.

56:57.040 --> 57:00.089
I just get really weird
when my hair's low for buns.

57:00.240 --> 57:02.163
I know.
But this is not a low, low.

57:02.320 --> 57:03.606
- It's not, you know...
- Yeah. Yeah.

57:03.760 --> 57:09.085
I still gonna give you a neckline
as much as I can.

57:09.560 --> 57:13.406
I know.
I know you know how I feel.

57:53.880 --> 57:55.291
And such.

58:18.080 --> 58:20.924
Dancers,
please sign in if you haven't.

58:32.240 --> 58:34.561
- Hey. Merde.
- How are you? Merde to you.

58:53.440 --> 58:55.886

58:56.040 --> 58:58.008

58:58.160 --> 58:59.844
<i>Thirty minutes.</i>

59:19.600 --> 59:21.045
- So, yeah.
- It's great, Justin.

59:21.240 --> 59:23.811
You know, we saw your Rabbit
two days ago.

59:23.960 --> 59:25.450
- Oh, yeah?
- Two nights ago, again.

59:25.600 --> 59:26.840
- I liked it. Again.
- Thanks.

59:27.040 --> 59:28.246
I liked it better
than the first time.

59:28.400 --> 59:29.606
No, I really did like it.

59:29.760 --> 59:31.480
Actually, it just becomes
better and better.

01:00:28.080 --> 01:00:32.085
How does it feel when you walk
on the staircase to the theater,

01:00:32.240 --> 01:00:34.447
and there...
Robbins, you, and Balanchine?

01:00:34.600 --> 01:00:37.683
Oh, my God. I am, like, freaking out
about that, yeah.

01:00:37.840 --> 01:00:39.763
Olga, he was in your class at
the School of American Ballet?

01:00:39.920 --> 01:00:41.251
Yes. Well, I mean... yeah.

01:00:41.400 --> 01:00:42.880
Not in my class,
but I did with him...

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:44.960
- But we worked together...
- On Scenes de Ballet.

01:00:45.120 --> 01:00:46.920
- On Chris Wheeldon's stuff.
- Chris Wheeldon.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.207
- Oh, I see. I see.
- Yeah.

01:00:49.360 --> 01:00:50.646
You got a good review.

01:00:50.800 --> 01:00:53.929
You're at the same level
as Alexei,

01:00:54.080 --> 01:00:57.482
Alexei Ratmansky
and Chris Wheeldon.

01:00:57.640 --> 01:00:59.324
Yeah,
that's quite a statement, so...

01:00:59.480 --> 01:01:01.960
No, it's great.
What you do is great.

01:01:27.320 --> 01:01:28.810
Amar?
- Yeah?

01:01:28.960 --> 01:01:30.644
You want to try anything?

01:01:31.240 --> 01:01:32.890
- I say we go for it.
- Okay.

01:01:33.080 --> 01:01:34.161
- Yeah?
- Yeah?

01:01:34.240 --> 01:01:35.969
- I'm just gonna grab those hips.
- The lifts and everything?

01:01:36.120 --> 01:01:37.360
- Yeah.
- Okay.

01:01:37.520 --> 01:01:38.726
I'm just gonna grab those hips
and do it.

01:01:38.920 --> 01:01:39.921
- Okay.
- Cool?

01:01:40.080 --> 01:01:42.321
- Cool.
- All right, baby. Give me a kiss.

01:01:42.680 --> 01:01:44.284
- You look handsome.
- Have a good time.

01:01:46.280 --> 01:01:47.725
You too. Merde.

01:02:05.640 --> 01:02:08.689
- Merde.
- Merde, guys.

01:06:49.400 --> 01:06:52.131
Guys, that was great.
Really great.

01:06:52.320 --> 01:06:54.721
- All right.
- It's great.

01:06:54.880 --> 01:06:56.166
- Thanks!
- Yeah.

01:06:56.360 --> 01:06:57.964
It looks so good.

01:06:58.560 --> 01:06:59.925
So good.
