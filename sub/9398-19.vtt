WEBVTT

00:01.201 --> 00:02.691
<i>Previously on</i> One Tree Hill.

00:02.769 --> 00:06.796
...some reporters asking questions about
point shaving, that kind of thing.

00:06.873 --> 00:08.773
- You know anything about that?
- No, sir.

00:08.842 --> 00:11.174
How bad will it get
if they find out about you and Daunte?

00:11.244 --> 00:12.768
They'll take my scholarship for sure.

00:12.846 --> 00:14.177
Coach, I lied to you.

00:14.247 --> 00:16.078
It wasn't Lucas. I'm sorry.

00:16.149 --> 00:17.241
So am I.

00:17.317 --> 00:19.877
I will accept whatever consequences
there might be.

00:19.953 --> 00:21.477
I love this game

00:21.554 --> 00:23.215
and I'm sorry I betrayed it.

00:23.289 --> 00:24.950
- You made a mistake.
- No.

00:25.025 --> 00:28.290
I saw you. I saw everything.

00:28.528 --> 00:33.363
Was my Uncle Keith still alive
when Jimmy shot himself?

00:34.634 --> 00:36.033
Who killed my uncle?

00:36.102 --> 00:39.196
It was your father. Dan Scott.

You son of a bitch!

00:55.822 --> 00:57.153
Stop!

00:57.891 --> 00:59.882
What's wrong with you?

01:00.527 --> 01:01.551
Karen, I'm...

01:01.628 --> 01:03.892
I'm sorry. It shouldn't have happened.
It just did.

01:03.963 --> 01:06.193
He killed Keith! He shot him!

01:12.372 --> 01:14.067
I should go.

01:17.410 --> 01:19.935
- Why would you say something like...
- 'Cause it's the truth!

01:20.013 --> 01:22.277
Stop it.

01:24.818 --> 01:27.218
Jimmy killed Keith.

01:28.688 --> 01:30.485
So stop it!

01:51.845 --> 01:55.246
I guess it was only a matter of time until
the entire town found out I'm a cheater.

01:55.315 --> 01:56.509
Sorry.

01:58.751 --> 02:00.013
You know, when I was in school,

02:00.086 --> 02:02.384
everybody was like laughing at me
after the tour

02:02.455 --> 02:04.719
and whispering and making fun of me
and stuff.

02:04.791 --> 02:07.817
I went to school one day and I wasn't
so interesting and it kind of blew over.

02:07.894 --> 02:11.295
- I think this probably will, too.
- I hope you're right.

02:11.364 --> 02:12.661
How's your valedictory speech coming?

02:12.732 --> 02:15.701
Very, very slowly. This is ridiculous.

02:15.768 --> 02:18.794
Graduation's like a few days away.
I'm supposed to be finished with it.

02:18.872 --> 02:20.305
I'm not even close.

02:20.373 --> 02:22.773
It'll be great. You'll be great.

02:25.011 --> 02:27.377
- Hear anything from Duke yet?
- Not yet.

02:27.447 --> 02:29.574
I'm guessing they're too busy
trying to find another shooting guard

02:29.649 --> 02:31.742
- to fill my scholarship.
- You don't know that.

02:31.818 --> 02:33.615
It's what I would do.

02:35.455 --> 02:37.650
Maybe you should talk to Whitey.

02:38.224 --> 02:41.990
He's always been there for you, you know?
Maybe he can help.

03:17.530 --> 03:20.499
- Do you know what today is, P. Sawyer?
- Shot in the dark.

03:20.567 --> 03:22.000
- Yearbook day.
- No.

03:22.068 --> 03:25.629
- It's the last Wednesday of high school.
- The beginning of the end.

03:25.705 --> 03:28.970
Do you always have to put a dark
and twisted spin on things?

03:29.042 --> 03:31.977
My point is that after this week
we actually have to figure out

03:32.045 --> 03:33.410
what we're gonna do with our lives.

03:33.479 --> 03:36.846
Oh, I thought you already did that.
Let's see? What does the yearbook say?

03:36.916 --> 03:37.940
"Brooke Davis".

03:42.355 --> 03:43.447
Joan Rivers?

03:43.523 --> 03:44.990
Come on, it was her or Ryan Seacrest.

03:45.058 --> 03:47.549
- Good choice.
- Thank you.

03:47.627 --> 03:50.221
What does the future holds
for Peyton Sawyer?

03:50.296 --> 03:52.856
Let's see.

03:53.366 --> 03:56.267
"Goal". It's blank. How predictable!

03:56.336 --> 03:58.770
That's what I call ambition.

03:58.838 --> 04:02.831
You don't think maybe it's time
you just aim for something?

04:02.909 --> 04:04.843
Well, maybe I have.

04:04.911 --> 04:08.745
I applied for an internship
with Sire Records a few months ago

04:08.815 --> 04:10.282
and I just found out I got it.

04:10.350 --> 04:11.374
Seriously?

04:11.451 --> 04:14.181
They need an answer as soon as possible.

04:14.254 --> 04:17.553
- So say yes.
- It's in Los Angeles.

04:17.624 --> 04:20.559
Wait. We can spend
the summer together in L.A.

04:20.627 --> 04:24.654
We can stay with my parents and...
This is kind of perfect.

04:24.731 --> 04:27.029
Yeah, I know. I just have to tell Lucas.

04:27.100 --> 04:29.466
Peyton, he's gonna be happy for you.

04:29.535 --> 04:31.162
Just like I am.

04:38.678 --> 04:40.009
Hey.

04:40.079 --> 04:42.912
Sorry to pull you out of class,
but I need a moment of your time.

04:42.982 --> 04:44.916
- I think I know what this is about.
- You do?

04:44.984 --> 04:47.680
Yeah. I... I know I was supposed to give
you a copy of my valedictory speech.

04:47.754 --> 04:49.688
It's just not quite finished yet, so...

04:49.756 --> 04:52.122
I'm sorry to tell you this,
but you're not going to be able

04:52.191 --> 04:55.183
to deliver your valedictory address
this Saturday.

04:55.261 --> 04:57.855
Why? What happened?
Did somebody beat me out after finals?

04:57.930 --> 05:02.162
No. You finished at the top of your class.
And I'm very proud of you for that,

05:02.235 --> 05:04.328
but the school board
has expressed some concerns

05:04.404 --> 05:06.998
in light of what's happened recently.

05:09.142 --> 05:11.303
Okay, so this is about Nathan?

05:11.377 --> 05:14.278
- Haley...
- I worked really, really hard for this.

05:14.347 --> 05:16.679
I know you did, Haley.

05:16.783 --> 05:19.547
But this has become very public.

05:20.953 --> 05:22.284
I'm sorry.

05:35.234 --> 05:36.326
Can I help you?

05:36.402 --> 05:39.496
Yeah, I'd like to speak to a detective.

05:39.572 --> 05:41.335
What's this regarding?

05:42.375 --> 05:44.536
I'd like to report a murder.

06:27.820 --> 06:32.257
Okay, let me make sure I understand this.

06:33.159 --> 06:38.358
You're accusing the Mayor of this town,
who also happens to be your father,

06:38.598 --> 06:41.726
of killing his brother, your uncle,

06:41.801 --> 06:45.567
and you're making this serious accusation
without any proof?

06:45.772 --> 06:48.570
Like I told you, I have proof.

06:48.641 --> 06:51.474
Right. The girl who witnessed everything.

06:51.544 --> 06:53.842
And what was her name?

06:53.913 --> 06:56.882
Yeah, who is this girl, Lucas?
She sounds disturbed.

06:56.949 --> 06:58.211
Maybe if you could put us
in touch with her,

06:58.284 --> 07:00.479
we could clear up this
horrible misunderstanding.

07:00.553 --> 07:03.420
I'm sorry to waste your time with this,
Mr. Mayor.

07:03.489 --> 07:05.013
I know how busy you are.

07:05.091 --> 07:07.025
Well, that's not a problem.

07:07.093 --> 07:09.357
You see, Captain, I recently started
a relationship with his mother.

07:09.429 --> 07:11.727
So you can't blame him for being angry.

07:11.798 --> 07:14.790
I'm just surprised
at this hateful accusation.

07:15.134 --> 07:19.161
Still, I think it's best
if we just forget it ever happened.

07:19.238 --> 07:22.674
I spent that day with your father
outside the school.

07:23.176 --> 07:26.077
I was the one that told him
his brother had died.

07:26.612 --> 07:31.777
What you have done here today
is reckless and inexcusable,

07:31.851 --> 07:35.252
and I think you owe him an apology.

07:57.577 --> 07:59.841
He's a troubled boy.

08:03.749 --> 08:06.877
- Mom, what the hell?
- I'm cleaning my gun.

08:06.953 --> 08:09.217
You don't want me to have a misfire,
do you?

08:09.288 --> 08:12.451
Well, here's a thought. No gun, no misfire.
Problem solved.

08:12.525 --> 08:13.685
What's the fun in that?

08:13.759 --> 08:16.819
Oh, by the way, Haley told me that
you invited her to a shooting range.

08:16.896 --> 08:18.488
Are you completely out of your mind?

08:18.564 --> 08:20.657
There is some evidence to support that.

08:20.733 --> 08:22.530
Mom, guns and babies don't mix.

08:22.602 --> 08:24.001
Oh, Nathan, don't worry.

08:24.070 --> 08:25.401
As soon as the baby is born,

08:25.471 --> 08:28.770
the gun will be stored in my locker
at the shooting range.

08:28.841 --> 08:31.708
You've got a locker at the shooting range?

08:33.446 --> 08:36.677
Forget it. I'm late for school.

08:39.585 --> 08:41.815
Joan Rivers, huh?

08:41.888 --> 08:43.287
Some lofty aspirations.

08:43.356 --> 08:46.189
No making fun, X-Games gold medalist.

08:46.259 --> 08:48.693
You already looked me up in the yearbook.

08:48.761 --> 08:51.025
- That's good to know.
- Don't get cocky.

08:51.097 --> 08:54.157
I didn't look you up. I just opened it
to a random page and there you were.

08:54.233 --> 08:55.700
Some people would call that fate.

08:55.768 --> 08:57.759
I call it a coincidence.

09:03.242 --> 09:06.734
So, I was wondering...

09:07.246 --> 09:10.238
Why did you leave Clean Teens?

09:11.017 --> 09:13.884
I realized I was just hiding out
in Clean Teens.

09:13.953 --> 09:16.922
I mean, I didn't join the club
because I was against sex.

09:16.989 --> 09:19.480
I'm sure I'd actually like sex.

09:19.559 --> 09:22.153
- You definitely would.
- Yeah. My point is,

09:22.228 --> 09:25.686
I thought if I join Clean Teens,
girls wouldn't be interested in me.

09:25.765 --> 09:28.165
And then maybe I wouldn't have
my heart broken again.

09:28.234 --> 09:31.635
- And then I came along.
- Yep.

09:31.704 --> 09:34.070
So that didn't work.

09:34.140 --> 09:35.437
I'm sorry.

09:35.508 --> 09:38.875
If it means anything,
I've been thinking about you.

09:38.945 --> 09:40.572
Me, too.

09:40.646 --> 09:43.877
Really? What you been thinking?

09:44.850 --> 09:47.819
Well, how about I write it
in your yearbook?

09:49.255 --> 09:51.223
This isn't mine.

09:51.290 --> 09:53.520
It's Bevin's. She's signing mine this period.

09:53.593 --> 09:55.584
Oh, okay.

09:55.661 --> 09:58.562
But we can exchange books
in calculus tomorrow.

09:58.631 --> 10:00.929
That way I can sign yours, too.

10:01.300 --> 10:04.360
I'd like that. I'll see you there.

10:38.704 --> 10:41.571
- Hey, Mouth.
- Gigi. Hi.

10:41.641 --> 10:43.108
I didn't know you were
on the yearbook staff.

10:43.175 --> 10:45.871
- I like to keep myself occupied.
- Good idea.

10:45.945 --> 10:48.140
Listen, I have to ask you something
about the yearbook.

10:48.214 --> 10:51.945
I thought it might bother you.
I hope you're not upset with me.

10:52.018 --> 10:55.920
- Why would I be upset with you?
- Oh, no reason.

10:55.988 --> 10:58.752
Actually, I'm upset about
what's not in the yearbook.

10:58.824 --> 11:00.883
Jimmy Edwards. Here, look at this picture.

11:00.960 --> 11:03.121
That's Jimmy. Why was he cropped out?

11:03.195 --> 11:07.188
Well, he was originally in it,
but we were told to take him out.

11:18.911 --> 11:21.209
You know, I think I'm actually
getting fatter by the minute.

11:21.280 --> 11:22.338
I hope so.

11:22.415 --> 11:23.905
You're just saying that
to make me feel better.

11:23.983 --> 11:27.316
No. I'm saying that because the bigger
you get, the taller our son's gonna be.

11:27.386 --> 11:28.751
So, it's all right if
I look like a Weeble Wobble

11:28.821 --> 11:31.619
as long as our son can dunk a basketball?

11:31.724 --> 11:33.123
Have you finished your speech yet?

11:33.192 --> 11:36.787
I'm not...
I'm not gonna be giving the speech.

11:36.862 --> 11:38.386
Haley, come on.

11:38.464 --> 11:39.726
Look, everyone knows
you're pregnant, okay?

11:39.799 --> 11:42.131
Pregnant people get bigger. It's natural.

11:42.201 --> 11:44.999
It's actually Principal Turner.

11:45.071 --> 11:48.165
He told me that I'm not allowed
to give the speech on graduation.

11:48.240 --> 11:49.969
What are you talking about? Why?

11:50.042 --> 11:55.537
He just said the whole
Rachel scandal, test thing...

11:55.614 --> 11:58.981
It's just kind of made it not appropriate.

11:59.051 --> 12:01.451
It's because of me, isn't it?

12:01.520 --> 12:03.147
Yeah.

12:05.391 --> 12:09.327
Look, it's really okay.
It is. It's not a big deal, okay?

12:09.395 --> 12:13.024
It's just some stupid speech I probably
wouldn't have even finished anyway.

12:13.099 --> 12:15.124
It's not a stupid speech,

12:15.201 --> 12:19.763
- and they can't do this to you, Haley.
- They can. And it's not...

12:19.839 --> 12:21.739
It doesn't matter.

12:21.807 --> 12:26.141
High school's almost over, you know?
Let them take the stupid speech.

12:26.212 --> 12:29.113
They can't take away everything else
I've accomplished.

12:32.818 --> 12:33.842
<i>So, how you holding up?</i>

12:35.454 --> 12:37.820
Oh, well, I've been better.

12:38.624 --> 12:41.252
How are you doing?
You're the one who was attacked.

12:41.327 --> 12:43.659
Yeah. That's why I stopped by.

12:44.563 --> 12:48.727
I was up all night, Karen.
I'm really worried about Lucas.

12:49.635 --> 12:52.433
Yeah, I wish I could get into his head

12:52.505 --> 12:54.097
and understand
what it is he's going through.

12:54.173 --> 12:56.471
Well, that's just it.
We can't get in his head.

12:56.542 --> 12:59.909
And I think this problem is too serious
for us to deal with ourselves.

12:59.979 --> 13:01.105
What are you saying?

13:01.180 --> 13:03.011
I want to be there for you,
I wanna be there for the baby

13:03.082 --> 13:04.208
and I wanna be there for Lucas.

13:04.283 --> 13:05.409
But suddenly he's lashing out.

13:05.484 --> 13:08.078
- Yeah, well, can you blame him?
- No.

13:08.154 --> 13:09.883
But I do think he needs guidance.

13:09.955 --> 13:11.946
And that's why I think we should get
him some professional help.

13:12.024 --> 13:14.424
Someone to help him through this
awkward period of... Of us.

13:14.493 --> 13:16.984
Of replacing Keith. Of all of it.

13:18.030 --> 13:19.622
I love Lucas.

13:20.800 --> 13:23.894
And I really think it's important
that we do this for him.

13:30.910 --> 13:32.935
Hey, Peyton,
I need your opinion on something

13:33.012 --> 13:34.980
and feel free to be brutally honest.

13:35.047 --> 13:38.210
Yeah, right. 'Cause it really worked out
last time I was brutally honest with you.

13:38.284 --> 13:39.717
Okay, first of all, let's not go there.

13:39.785 --> 13:42.310
Second, as long as you don't declare
your love for Chase any time soon,

13:42.388 --> 13:43.446
we'll be fine.

13:43.522 --> 13:45.490
Well, he is seriously cute.

13:46.892 --> 13:47.950
Too soon?

13:48.027 --> 13:49.051
- Too soon.
- Sorry.

13:49.128 --> 13:51.096
Anyway, I'm signing
Chase's yearbook tomorrow

13:51.163 --> 13:54.155
and I've prepared
two possible inscriptions.

13:54.233 --> 13:56.360
- No, you didn't.
- Yes, I did.

13:56.435 --> 13:58.835
One expresses my true feelings for him

13:58.904 --> 14:02.567
and the other talks about
how cool I think skateboarding is.

14:02.641 --> 14:06.941
Brooke, you sure about this?
Like, you really want Chase back?

14:07.012 --> 14:10.175
Yes. I want him. I miss him.

14:10.249 --> 14:14.242
And if he's gonna put himself out there,
then so will I.

14:14.320 --> 14:15.878
Well, how do you know
he's gonna put himself out there?

14:15.955 --> 14:19.721
Because he told me he's gonna tell me
how he feels about me in my yearbook.

14:19.792 --> 14:22.022
Well, good. I hope this works out.

14:22.094 --> 14:23.857
Thanks. Me, too.

14:23.929 --> 14:25.954
Besides, he's a really good kisser.

14:26.031 --> 14:28.465
Okay, let me know what you think.

14:37.042 --> 14:39.738
Lucas, I need to talk to you.

14:47.720 --> 14:49.585
I love you.

14:49.655 --> 14:51.589
You are the most important person
in my life

14:51.657 --> 14:54.649
and it kills me to see you hurting like this.

14:56.161 --> 15:00.188
But Keith is gone
and he's not coming back.

15:03.369 --> 15:07.499
And eventually
I need to go on with my life.

15:07.573 --> 15:10.542
- With Dan?
- Maybe.

15:13.979 --> 15:15.503
I don't know.

15:19.051 --> 15:21.110
Lucas, let me in. Please.

15:21.186 --> 15:24.383
- You won't believe me, Ma.
- Try me.

15:32.831 --> 15:34.526
I had a dream.

15:35.434 --> 15:38.995
I saw this girl
the day Keith was shot.

15:40.105 --> 15:42.073
She was in the hallway.

15:42.141 --> 15:44.769
She watched it happen.

15:44.843 --> 15:47.175
She saw everything.

15:47.246 --> 15:48.873
Okay.

15:50.349 --> 15:53.409
It was real, Mom. It...

15:54.787 --> 15:58.450
The girl, I found her.

15:58.691 --> 16:00.886
Her name's Abby, and she...

16:02.628 --> 16:04.562
She was there.

16:04.630 --> 16:07.690
She watched Keith die.

16:07.766 --> 16:08.994
She told me.

16:09.068 --> 16:11.798
She told you she saw Jimmy shoot Keith?

16:13.305 --> 16:14.602
No.

16:19.545 --> 16:21.740
She told me Dan shot Keith.

16:23.215 --> 16:25.581
But now she's gone.

16:25.651 --> 16:27.619
I can't prove it.

16:27.686 --> 16:32.089
Lucas, I know how desperately
you want to believe in this.

16:32.157 --> 16:34.387
No. It's true.

16:37.162 --> 16:40.598
I think that it is time
that you go talk to somebody.

16:40.666 --> 16:44.363
A professional.
Somebody who can help you through this.

16:44.436 --> 16:47.633
- I'm not crazy.
- I know.

16:48.040 --> 16:51.771
But I think that you have a problem.
We both think so.

16:52.745 --> 16:53.905
We?

16:54.747 --> 16:56.374
Dan and I.

16:59.318 --> 17:01.377
Lucas,

17:04.056 --> 17:06.183
do this for us.

17:10.996 --> 17:12.258
Please.

17:28.981 --> 17:32.815
Mr. McFadden. What can I do for you?

17:32.951 --> 17:35.852
I want to know why you had Jimmy
Edwards removed from the yearbook.

17:35.921 --> 17:39.322
Jimmy Edwards is no longer a student
at this school.

17:39.758 --> 17:43.159
Well, in two days I won't be either,
but I'm still in the yearbook.

17:44.296 --> 17:49.165
Look, Mouth.
A yearbook is a collection of memories.

17:49.234 --> 17:52.931
A book that, 20 years from now,
these students will flip through

17:53.072 --> 17:55.734
and remember what they loved
about this school.

17:55.808 --> 17:59.972
I don't want them to look back
and be reminded of that terrible day.

18:00.345 --> 18:04.406
It happened. It's a part of all of us.

18:05.050 --> 18:07.644
But he deserves to be remembered.

18:07.719 --> 18:09.311
Trust me.

18:09.421 --> 18:12.151
No one will ever forget Jimmy Edwards.

18:15.928 --> 18:18.829
Have you told Lucas
about the internship, yet?

18:18.897 --> 18:22.264
No. Not yet.
I haven't been able to reach him.

18:22.334 --> 18:24.996
Sorry, but you might wanna get used to it.

18:25.070 --> 18:28.528
Life as Lucas Scott's girlfriend
can get pretty lonely sometimes.

18:33.745 --> 18:37.237
Moment of truth.
You got your cheat sheet?

18:37.316 --> 18:40.615
- Which one are you gonna use?
- I'm gonna tell him how I feel.

18:40.686 --> 18:42.210
Wish me luck.

18:42.921 --> 18:43.910
Hi.

18:44.323 --> 18:47.349
- Saved you a spot. First page.
- Perfect.

18:54.566 --> 18:58.935
Hey, Mouth. I brought you something.
It's Jimmy's.

18:59.004 --> 19:00.369
I don't understand.

19:00.439 --> 19:01.997
His mom ordered it last fall.

19:02.074 --> 19:05.373
We were gonna mail it to her,
but I figured you'd want to take it to her.

19:05.444 --> 19:07.139
Thanks.

19:07.212 --> 19:08.338
I don't know what she wants
with a yearbook

19:08.413 --> 19:11.746
that Jimmy's not even in,
but I'll take it to her.

19:12.985 --> 19:14.612
Do you have a free period right now?

19:14.686 --> 19:17.450
Gigi, I'm a senior.
I pretty much have a free week.

19:17.523 --> 19:19.753
Good. Come on.

19:22.961 --> 19:25.225
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

19:30.569 --> 19:32.935
- Thanks again, Brooke.
- Sure.

19:33.005 --> 19:35.405
- So I'll see you later?
- Hope so.

19:44.650 --> 19:45.878
Oh, no.

19:54.927 --> 19:56.792
Nice shot.

19:56.862 --> 19:59.092
You always make it look so easy.

19:59.164 --> 20:01.598
There's no pressure out here.
There's nothing on the line.

20:01.667 --> 20:04.602
Besides, on this court,
the shots don't really matter.

20:04.670 --> 20:08.436
They all matter, Nathan. Every shot.

20:10.175 --> 20:13.736
Duke is rescinding your scholarship offer.

20:16.148 --> 20:18.776
Sorry I couldn't help you on this one.

20:20.385 --> 20:22.250
I understand.

20:24.356 --> 20:26.517
So, I guess it's over, huh?

20:26.592 --> 20:29.618
Far as I know, basketball's never over
until you put down the ball

20:29.695 --> 20:31.390
and walk off the court.

20:31.463 --> 20:35.661
- You know what I mean, Coach.
- No, Nathan, I don't think I do.

20:35.734 --> 20:38.760
What the heck have I been teaching you
all these years?

20:39.304 --> 20:42.603
When somebody says
you can't do something, you fight back.

20:42.674 --> 20:43.971
You prove them wrong.

20:44.042 --> 20:47.170
They took away my scholarship, Coach.
They don't want me anymore.

20:47.246 --> 20:49.612
Then find somebody who does!

20:49.681 --> 20:54.084
Nathan, where is the fire that made you
the best player I ever coached?

20:54.152 --> 20:55.642
Show me it's still there.

20:55.721 --> 21:00.124
If it's not, put down that ball
and walk off the court.

21:04.529 --> 21:07.930
People love a guy
who rises from the ashes.

21:09.034 --> 21:10.592
Remember that.

21:23.315 --> 21:25.647
What are you doing here, Lucas?

21:28.987 --> 21:31.888
Why did you paint this wall red, Dan?

21:32.524 --> 21:37.052
- You covering something up?
- I wanted it red. I like red.

21:37.129 --> 21:39.654
Abby told me she sent you messages.

21:40.232 --> 21:42.029
Stalked you.

21:43.035 --> 21:45.469
Did she write something on this wall, Dan?

21:45.537 --> 21:47.801
That girl's crazy.
She's gotten inside your head, Lucas.

21:47.873 --> 21:49.807
I know what you did

21:51.376 --> 21:53.435
but I can't prove it.

21:54.146 --> 21:57.479
So, all I can do now
is keep you away from my mom.

21:57.549 --> 22:01.110
I can see that you're upset,
but everything's gonna be okay.

22:01.386 --> 22:02.648
You're gonna go off to school

22:02.721 --> 22:05.053
and I'm going to stay here and take care
of your mom and the baby.

22:05.123 --> 22:06.590
That's not gonna happen.

22:06.658 --> 22:11.186
You'll realize it's a good thing.
Your mom needs me. You'll see.

22:18.704 --> 22:21.298
Coach. Hi, this is Nathan Scott.

22:21.373 --> 22:22.362
Yeah.

22:22.441 --> 22:25.069
Well, I was wondering if you
still needed a shooting guard,

22:25.143 --> 22:27.941
because I'd love to come up there and...

22:29.514 --> 22:34.076
Yeah, I understand. Thanks for your time.

22:38.924 --> 22:40.619
Any luck?

22:41.593 --> 22:44.653
It's over, Haley.
Nobody wants anything to do with me.

22:44.730 --> 22:47.028
- Don't say that.
- It's true.

22:47.099 --> 22:48.623
I ruined everything.

22:48.700 --> 22:51.726
And now you can't even give this
speech that you worked so hard for,

22:51.803 --> 22:54.567
that you earned, because I screwed it up.

22:54.639 --> 22:58.666
I don't care about the speech, Nathan.
I care about us.

22:59.878 --> 23:01.505
I love you.

23:02.948 --> 23:05.314
- Do you love me?
- Of course I love you.

23:05.384 --> 23:09.445
Okay. Then that's all that matters.
All right?

23:09.521 --> 23:12.979
We are gonna find a way
to get through this together.

23:13.558 --> 23:14.923
I promise.

23:26.138 --> 23:30.575
You know, for what it's worth,
I miss hanging out with you.

23:31.042 --> 23:34.273
I miss it, too.
I think about you all the time.

23:34.346 --> 23:36.280
- Really?
- Of course.

23:36.348 --> 23:40.011
But I still think we made
the right decision to break up.

23:40.085 --> 23:42.315
I'm pretty sure you were flying solo
on that decision.

23:42.387 --> 23:45.379
But I understood it. I still do.

23:46.491 --> 23:48.982
But who knows? Maybe someday.

23:50.162 --> 23:52.687
This is incredible, Gigi.
What can I do to thank you?

23:52.764 --> 23:56.131
- You can let me sign your yearbook.
- I was hoping you would.

24:02.240 --> 24:03.798
Read this!

24:09.748 --> 24:11.147
- Ouch.
- Yeah.

24:11.216 --> 24:13.047
And I just poured my heart out
in his yearbook.

24:13.118 --> 24:14.608
I'm so embarrassed.

24:14.686 --> 24:17.154
Maybe you should've opted
for that "skateboarders are cool" version.

24:17.222 --> 24:19.383
This is not funny.
You know what this means, don't you?

24:19.458 --> 24:21.756
I can never show my face
at this school again.

24:21.827 --> 24:24.694
Yeah. It's a good thing
high school's almost over.

24:24.763 --> 24:26.788
- Shut up.
- Hey!

24:33.638 --> 24:36.106
- All done.
- That didn't take long.

24:36.174 --> 24:37.334
You were easy.

24:37.409 --> 24:39.934
- I hope that's a good thing.
- It is.

24:41.346 --> 24:44.372
I don't know if I'll get to see you
before you leave,

24:44.449 --> 24:46.508
so I'll say goodbye now.

24:46.585 --> 24:50.316
- I'm gonna miss you, Mouth.
- I'm gonna miss you, too.

24:51.189 --> 24:52.554
Come here.

24:57.229 --> 24:58.423
Hey, Gigi.

24:58.497 --> 25:00.624
Yesterday, when you asked
if I was upset with you

25:00.699 --> 25:02.394
because of what was in the yearbook,

25:02.467 --> 25:05.630
- what did you mean?
- Page 23.

25:24.823 --> 25:27.849
Hey. Look who decided
to come out of hiding.

25:27.926 --> 25:30.417
- Since when do you ditch school?
- Come on, finals are over.

25:30.495 --> 25:32.395
Give me one good reason
to be here this week.

25:32.464 --> 25:35.126
Actually, I have one.

25:35.200 --> 25:37.134
This is yours. I picked it up this morning

25:37.202 --> 25:38.965
'cause I wanted to be
the very first one to sign it.

25:39.037 --> 25:40.368
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

25:40.438 --> 25:42.736
I kind of got carried away
and took up an entire page

25:42.807 --> 25:44.832
but I figured that's
my right as the best friend.

25:44.910 --> 25:47.572
- Yes. You are my best friend.
- Yeah?

25:49.014 --> 25:52.108
I can't believe high school is almost over.

25:52.884 --> 25:55.079
Do you remember the first day
of freshman year?

25:55.153 --> 25:57.485
Oh, yes. You asked me to pretend
to be your boyfriend

25:57.556 --> 25:58.784
so the other guys wouldn't bother you.

25:58.857 --> 26:01.087
I know, you were the best
fake boyfriend ever.

26:01.159 --> 26:02.990
- God, it seems like forever ago, huh?
- It does.

26:03.061 --> 26:05.029
Did you ever think this is how
senior year would end up?

26:05.096 --> 26:06.222
What? Me married, pregnant,

26:06.298 --> 26:09.927
living with a recovering junkie
who's packing heat? Absolutely.

26:10.001 --> 26:10.990
What was that?

26:11.069 --> 26:13.902
Deb. She keeps a gun in the kitchen
in a cookie jar.

26:13.972 --> 26:17.373
She asked me to go to the shooting
range with her while I'm pregnant.

26:17.442 --> 26:19.307
She's out of her mind.

26:25.483 --> 26:29.317
Hello. Anybody home?

27:00.385 --> 27:01.784
Hey, Coach.

27:02.821 --> 27:04.118
Got a minute?

27:04.189 --> 27:07.454
Looks like I'm getting more visits
in the house than I got in my office.

27:07.525 --> 27:10.392
- Are you?
- I guess since I'm retired,

27:10.462 --> 27:12.225
I ought to start a new business.

27:12.297 --> 27:14.561
Charge fees for my advice.

27:14.633 --> 27:16.931
That's not a bad idea.
What do you think you'd call it?

27:17.002 --> 27:19.596
Oh, I don't know. I'll think of something.

27:19.671 --> 27:22.640
I don't know how much advice I need,
but I could sure use your help.

27:22.707 --> 27:25.540
- What can I do for you?
- You can help Nathan.

27:25.610 --> 27:26.804
Everybody's turned their back on him.

27:26.878 --> 27:29.779
You're the only person
that's never let him down.

27:29.848 --> 27:33.340
Haley, I don't know
what I can do for him at this point.

27:33.618 --> 27:36.746
Well, I'm sure
you could think of something.

27:39.624 --> 27:43.651
Coach, he's still that guy that helped
you win all those games.

27:43.728 --> 27:45.525
He's got the heart of a champion
and you know that.

27:45.597 --> 27:46.757
You've watched him grow,

27:46.831 --> 27:49.095
and you know
the kind of person that he is.

27:50.035 --> 27:53.664
Can't you just help him
be more that person?

27:54.506 --> 27:57.407
Help him for all the times he's helped you.

27:59.911 --> 28:01.776
Let me think a bit.

28:26.037 --> 28:29.939
Hi. Freshmen. Great.

28:30.975 --> 28:33.705
As your Student Council President,
I just wanted to come by

28:33.778 --> 28:37.407
and personally say good luck
with the rest of high school.

28:37.482 --> 28:39.712
You guys are gonna love
the next three years.

28:39.784 --> 28:41.809
I can't wait!

28:42.854 --> 28:45.220
Well, maybe not all of you.

28:45.290 --> 28:47.451
Okay. Have a good day.

28:55.600 --> 28:57.830
Excuse me. I have a boyfriend.

28:57.902 --> 29:00.632
Really? Where is he?

29:00.705 --> 29:04.197
Good question. I've been wondering
that myself for two days.

29:04.275 --> 29:06.937
- Yeah, I guess I deserve that.
- Makes a girl feel cheap.

29:07.011 --> 29:09.070
Give it up in Honey Grove
and then poof! Vanishing boyfriend.

29:09.147 --> 29:11.047
- Poof?
- Poof.

29:12.183 --> 29:14.242
Look, I'm sorry.

29:14.319 --> 29:16.913
I kind of have this habit
of crawling into my shell.

29:16.988 --> 29:20.617
Well, quit your dumb habit, 'cause your
girlfriend really needs you this weekend.

29:20.692 --> 29:22.557
What's going on?

29:22.627 --> 29:26.654
I have an impossible decision to make,
and not a whole lot of time to make it in.

29:26.798 --> 29:30.097
Okay. Look, I'm here now. Tell me about it.

29:32.070 --> 29:35.597
I applied for an internship at Sire Records
a few months ago,

29:35.673 --> 29:37.641
before we were together.

29:37.709 --> 29:40.041
And I just found out I got it.

29:40.812 --> 29:42.746
Oh, my God, that's great.

29:42.814 --> 29:44.805
It's in Los Angeles.

29:49.187 --> 29:50.677
Take it.

29:51.289 --> 29:52.847
You deserve it.

29:54.492 --> 29:58.428
- I don't want to leave you.
- I will be here when you get back.

29:59.130 --> 30:02.691
But you are destined for greatness,
Peyton, and we both know that.

30:02.767 --> 30:05.827
This is your first step.
You can't pass that up.

30:05.904 --> 30:08.338
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

30:08.406 --> 30:10.271
I'm so proud of you.

30:13.845 --> 30:16.211
Look, Peyton.

30:16.381 --> 30:18.576
- You know I love you, right?
- Yeah.

30:19.317 --> 30:22.218
No matter what happens
to either one of us,

30:22.287 --> 30:25.051
you will always be in my heart.

30:27.125 --> 30:30.288
Excuse me, everybody.
This'll only take a minute.

30:33.331 --> 30:35.891
This yearbook belongs to Jimmy Edwards.

30:35.967 --> 30:37.867
Everyone knows his name,

30:37.936 --> 30:41.337
but some of you actually knew Jimmy
before that day.

30:41.406 --> 30:45.740
Maybe you sat with him at lunch.
Maybe you went to grade school together.

30:47.545 --> 30:50.571
If you knew Jimmy, even for a short time,

30:50.648 --> 30:52.616
then you probably have
some good memories of him.

30:52.684 --> 30:56.279
And I hope you'll consider
writing them down in his yearbook.

30:56.354 --> 30:57.616
Thanks.

31:02.527 --> 31:06.964
Lucas, I know how you feel about Jimmy,
but it's the right thing to do.

31:08.600 --> 31:10.227
I know it is.

31:11.135 --> 31:12.932
You got a pen?

31:18.443 --> 31:22.470
Hey, you're a great friend, Mouth.

31:23.081 --> 31:25.208
Jimmy would really appreciate this.

31:42.934 --> 31:44.458
Principal Turner?

31:44.535 --> 31:47.993
Whatever it is, Mr. Scott, it'll have to wait.

31:48.072 --> 31:49.300
I'm very busy.

31:49.374 --> 31:51.740
This won't take long, I promise.

31:53.411 --> 31:54.605
Okay.

31:57.749 --> 31:59.580
Okay.

31:59.651 --> 32:01.084
I'm sorry.

32:01.152 --> 32:04.087
I know I embarrassed you.
I embarrassed this school.

32:04.155 --> 32:06.680
And I'm sorry for that. I am, but...

32:06.758 --> 32:08.726
Please, don't take this out on Haley.

32:08.793 --> 32:12.957
- This wasn't an easy decision, Nathan.
- But you made it.

32:13.031 --> 32:16.296
And now, the best student,
the best person in this school,

32:16.367 --> 32:19.393
can't give a speech
because she's married to me.

32:19.470 --> 32:21.529
Does that sound fair to you?

32:22.106 --> 32:24.097
You should know that I've received
numerous phone calls

32:24.175 --> 32:26.905
from parents and school board members.

32:28.313 --> 32:30.747
Do you have a wife, Principal Turner?

32:31.616 --> 32:33.083
Yes, I do.

32:33.785 --> 32:35.776
Is she the best part of you?

32:36.788 --> 32:39.188
Would you want her to pay
for your mistakes?

32:41.125 --> 32:44.754
We've all made mistakes,
and believe me, I'm paying for mine,

32:45.396 --> 32:47.261
but Haley's a good person,

32:47.332 --> 32:50.563
and she's worked for four years
to be valedictorian.

32:53.004 --> 32:55.234
She deserves to be recognized.

33:13.091 --> 33:15.753
Hi. Come in.

33:35.213 --> 33:36.703
Hey.

33:37.015 --> 33:38.642
You're a little late. I'm kind of hungry.

33:38.716 --> 33:40.877
- Are you hungry?
- No.

33:40.952 --> 33:43.250
Let's go out. We never go out anymore.

33:43.321 --> 33:45.414
Let's go eat something really bad
for us and pig out.

33:45.490 --> 33:48.584
That sounds great, but I'm guessing
you're gonna be a little busy tonight.

33:48.659 --> 33:50.752
Doing what?

33:52.463 --> 33:54.897
- What is this?
- It's the graduation program.

33:54.966 --> 33:58.766
"Tree Hill High School Graduation".

33:59.270 --> 34:02.103
"Valedictory address: Haley James Scott"?

34:02.173 --> 34:03.640
Turner changed his mind.

34:03.708 --> 34:07.542
Are you for real?
Oh, come here! Thank you.

34:08.980 --> 34:10.607
Oh, my God,
I have to go start writing my speech!

34:10.681 --> 34:11.875
You got a lot of work to do.

34:11.949 --> 34:13.940
I'll grab us something to eat, okay?
Something really bad for us.

34:14.018 --> 34:16.248
No. I'm gonna be speaking in front of
a thousand people on Saturday.

34:16.320 --> 34:19.777
Plus I'm pregnant.
I need healthy food. Healthy!

34:26.397 --> 34:29.491
Hey. You okay?

34:31.902 --> 34:33.837
I told Lucas about the internship.

34:33.905 --> 34:36.339
- What'd he say?
- He wants me to go.

34:36.407 --> 34:38.170
He's right.

34:39.643 --> 34:42.340
Was there a part of you
that was hoping he'd ask you to stay?

34:42.413 --> 34:45.473
No, no, no, it's not that.

34:45.683 --> 34:46.877
There's something going on with him,

34:46.951 --> 34:49.043
and I just worry about
being away all summer.

34:49.120 --> 34:51.554
Peyton, when has Lucas ever
not made the right decision?

34:51.621 --> 34:53.590
Well, let's see.

34:53.658 --> 34:55.784
He didn't take his heart pills
and collapsed recently.

34:55.860 --> 34:57.760
You know what I mean.

34:57.829 --> 35:00.730
Okay, if you're worried about
your relationship, it's one thing,

35:00.798 --> 35:03.164
but I don't think you need to be.

35:03.234 --> 35:05.794
Lucas is right. Take the internship.

35:05.937 --> 35:08.428
And have a fabulous summer in L.A.
With me.

35:09.874 --> 35:11.239
Yeah.

35:13.111 --> 35:14.601
I'll get it.

35:22.520 --> 35:23.817
Hey.

35:23.888 --> 35:25.480
Can I help you?

35:26.257 --> 35:29.488
I was hoping we could talk about
what you wrote in my yearbook.

35:29.560 --> 35:32.859
What's the point? I mean, I...
I didn't mean half the things I said.

35:32.930 --> 35:34.591
I just, for some stupid reason,

35:34.665 --> 35:37.259
thought you were going
to write something similar, so...

35:38.469 --> 35:39.663
I wanted to.

35:39.737 --> 35:42.672
Don't do that, okay? It's too late. It's fine.

35:44.442 --> 35:48.572
When I walked into that classroom today,
I was gonna tell you exactly how I feel.

35:49.447 --> 35:51.540
And I wanted to earlier in the hallway.

35:52.583 --> 35:55.313
- So, why didn't you?
- I don't know.

35:56.654 --> 36:00.021
Guess I wasn't sure I wanted
to put my heart out there again.

36:01.559 --> 36:07.122
But look, the point is,
everything that you wrote to me,

36:07.198 --> 36:08.790
I feel it, too.

36:10.868 --> 36:13.860
I just didn't know how to put it into words.

36:20.945 --> 36:22.640
You just did.

37:03.054 --> 37:05.249
Hello, this is Whitey Durham.

37:05.323 --> 37:10.226
I'm sorry to call so late, but I need
to speak with your athletic director.

37:18.603 --> 37:20.036
Marvin.

37:20.104 --> 37:22.538
I brought you something.

37:23.341 --> 37:26.208
It's Jimmy's yearbook.
A lot of people signed it.

37:26.277 --> 37:30.543
They... They said some really
nice things about Jimmy.

38:06.350 --> 38:07.840
Thank you.

38:46.424 --> 38:49.757
- Lucas is gonna be okay, Karen.
- I don't know.

38:51.762 --> 38:54.788
Something about this
just doesn't feel right.

38:56.367 --> 39:00.770
When I asked him to get help,
he looked betrayed.

39:00.838 --> 39:04.137
You did the right thing.
He's out of control. He's acting crazy.

39:07.712 --> 39:10.112
My son is not crazy.

39:11.849 --> 39:14.283
I'm sorry, Karen. I didn't mean it like that.

39:14.352 --> 39:17.844
You know, this isn't easy for me, Dan.
Any of this.

39:27.031 --> 39:28.931
What is it?

39:30.401 --> 39:32.835
Just a little problem
I thought I took care of.

39:32.903 --> 39:36.532
I have to go. This won't take long.
I'm sorry.

39:40.144 --> 39:41.975
Going somewhere, Dan?

39:42.747 --> 39:45.147
What do you think you're doing, Lucas?

39:46.317 --> 39:48.342
I'm protecting my mother.

39:53.991 --> 39:58.860
- What are you gonna do? Shoot me?
- Yes, I am.

40:00.531 --> 40:02.590
Just like you shot my Uncle Keith.

40:02.666 --> 40:05.100
Lucas what are you doing with a gun?

40:06.170 --> 40:08.229
- Put that down, right now!
- I can't!

40:08.305 --> 40:09.329
Lucas!

40:09.407 --> 40:12.001
The little text message Dan just got?

40:13.244 --> 40:14.506
I sent it.

40:15.012 --> 40:19.949
I pretended to be Abby. You know,
the girl who watched him murder Keith?

40:21.485 --> 40:25.216
You heard him. Abby's just a little problem
he thought he'd taken care of.

40:25.289 --> 40:26.916
Don't listen to him, Karen. He's delusional.

40:26.991 --> 40:28.390
Maybe

40:28.459 --> 40:32.088
you should tell the truth
when I have a gun aimed at your head.

40:32.163 --> 40:36.532
Lucas, please, just put the gun down.
All right? I can't...

40:38.636 --> 40:40.160
I can't...

40:42.873 --> 40:45.467
- Karen!
- Do not touch her.

40:45.543 --> 40:47.704
Mom! Mom, are you okay?

40:47.778 --> 40:50.906
- She could be having a miscarriage.
- You stay right there! Do not touch her!

40:50.981 --> 40:52.312
- Lucas!
- She's my mother!

40:52.383 --> 40:54.874
I swear to God I will kill you!

41:28.219 --> 41:29.345
