13:23.969 --> 13:25.721
got this place cloaked
in ferrofluids,

13:25.804 --> 13:28.682
{\an3}so from above it just
looks like a black hole.

13:28.766 --> 13:30.476
What about food?

13:32.311 --> 13:33.521
Enough food here

13:33.604 --> 13:35.523
to get us through the winter.

13:35.606 --> 13:37.358
What's that?

13:37.441 --> 13:38.567
That thing?

13:38.651 --> 13:40.027
That's a little TV.

13:40.110 --> 13:41.862
{\an3}Thing's so old
that it won't even

13:41.946 --> 13:43.822
leave an electronic footprint.

13:43.906 --> 13:45.699
NEWSWOMAN: We're getting
preliminary reports

13:45.783 --> 13:47.868
of a bomb blast
that ripped through the GSC

13:47.952 --> 13:49.203
Intelligence Wing.

13:49.286 --> 13:51.247
The blast is linked
to a teenage terrorist

13:51.330 --> 13:52.748
who is reportedly connected

13:52.831 --> 13:54.250
to former astronaut
Dr. Molly Woods

13:54.333 --> 13:57.211
and former Patrol
Special Officer JD Richter.

13:57.294 --> 13:59.296
This is a terrorist group

13:59.380 --> 14:01.131
with mysterious intentions.

14:01.215 --> 14:02.925
Who are these people,

14:03.008 --> 14:04.718
and what do they want?

14:04.802 --> 14:05.886
(static buzzes, crackles)

14:05.970 --> 14:07.721
We didn't do it.

14:07.805 --> 14:09.431
{\an1}(sighs): You know
what I think?

14:09.515 --> 14:12.977
I think Uncle Ares left us
a little parting gift.

14:13.060 --> 14:14.937
{\an1}MOLLY: Mm-mm.
She's telling the truth.

14:15.020 --> 14:16.605
Somebody's setting us up.

14:16.689 --> 14:19.108
So what, Shepherd just revoked
our hall pass?

14:19.191 --> 14:20.943
No. He wouldn't do that.

14:21.026 --> 14:23.362
{\an1}JD: No, of course not--
it must be Colonel Mustard

14:23.445 --> 14:25.906
{\an1}in the library
with the freakin' candlestick.

14:25.990 --> 14:28.033
Where are you going?

14:30.536 --> 14:31.829
He thinks we did it, and so will
the rest of the world.

14:31.912 --> 14:33.789
{\an1}Okay, look, you
can't go out there.

14:33.872 --> 14:35.916
It's dangerous.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.835
I'm gonna figure
this whole thing out.

14:37.918 --> 14:40.838
Okay? Promise.

14:49.471 --> 14:51.348
{\an6}MAN:
Initial reports--
five dead so far,

14:51.432 --> 14:53.309
{\an3}but the rescue crews
are still digging.

14:53.392 --> 14:55.144
{\an3}The intelligence floor
was wiped out, sir.

14:55.227 --> 14:56.937
Do you have names
of the deceased?

14:57.021 --> 14:58.480
{\an3}These four died
in the blast,

14:58.564 --> 15:01.609
{\an1}and this one
due to bodily injury.

15:01.692 --> 15:03.319
Bodily injury?

15:03.402 --> 15:05.654
Preliminary reports
say "broken neck."

15:05.738 --> 15:08.115
{\an3}I'm glad to see you're
all right, Tobias.

15:08.198 --> 15:10.159
{\an1}Nate Malone-- he was
on the virus team.

15:10.242 --> 15:12.828
He was a good man.
They all were.

15:12.911 --> 15:15.497
The hybrids escaped
through the evac tunnels.

15:15.581 --> 15:17.333
Only a handful of people

15:17.416 --> 15:19.835
with top security clearance
know they exist.

15:19.918 --> 15:22.671
Those tunnels have been there
for over 50 years, you know.

15:22.755 --> 15:25.007
{\an1}They could have found them
any number of ways.

15:25.090 --> 15:27.843
And Molly Woods--
what do we know?

15:27.926 --> 15:29.470
{\an1}Well, the Faraday Wing
was destroyed,

15:29.553 --> 15:31.639
{\an1}but we think she flatlined
before the blast.

15:31.722 --> 15:34.350
{\an3}Find her body.
I want proof of her death.

15:34.433 --> 15:36.477
{\an1}Of course.

15:36.560 --> 15:38.979
And, Toby...

15:39.063 --> 15:42.191
I want the name of every
employee with security clearance

15:42.274 --> 15:43.901
who knew about
those tunnels.

15:43.984 --> 15:46.111
We may have a mole.

15:55.954 --> 15:59.249
{\an5}FIONA:
Casualties are never easy to
explain to a mother or spouse,

15:59.333 --> 16:00.751
or a commander in chief.

16:00.834 --> 16:03.337
This one gives me pause.

16:03.420 --> 16:05.714
(sighs)
Very well.

16:05.798 --> 16:08.884
{\an3}He attempted to keep us
from the virus containment.

16:08.967 --> 16:11.804
{\an6}He was protecting
somebody.
Who?

16:11.887 --> 16:13.222
I don't know.

16:13.305 --> 16:15.099
{\an3}There were hybrids in
the building with bombs.

16:15.182 --> 16:17.810
Lives hung in the balance--
I had to take swift action.

16:17.893 --> 16:18.894
{\an3}And so...

16:18.977 --> 16:21.146
I killed him.

16:21.230 --> 16:23.357
Regrettable...

16:23.440 --> 16:25.401
but necessary.

16:25.484 --> 16:27.444
I thought so.

16:27.528 --> 16:29.196
Madam Secretary,

16:29.279 --> 16:30.906
{\an1}we've identified
the bodies.

16:30.989 --> 16:33.075
{\an1}All those missing
have been accounted for,

16:33.158 --> 16:35.244
except for Molly Woods.

16:40.207 --> 16:42.584
Dispatch a Humanichs team.

16:42.668 --> 16:44.253
Find Molly Woods

16:44.336 --> 16:46.422
{\an1}and bring her in.
Dead or alive?

16:46.505 --> 16:48.132
Either.

16:48.215 --> 16:50.384
Yes, ma'am.

16:58.058 --> 17:00.144
{\an5}I'm sorry, but
he's not seeing...
It's all right.

17:00.227 --> 17:01.770
I lost Ethan.

17:01.854 --> 17:04.106
I know there were casualties...

17:04.189 --> 17:07.984
Well... he wasn't among them.

17:08.068 --> 17:10.570
(relieved sigh)

17:10.654 --> 17:13.906
I had a local GPS on him
and it cut out.

17:13.991 --> 17:16.285
If Lucy finds him,
she'll hurt him.

17:16.367 --> 17:19.579
Why... would she want
to hurt Ethan?

17:19.663 --> 17:21.123
Sir...

17:21.205 --> 17:23.083
Lucy attacked me.

17:23.166 --> 17:25.836
{\an3}A Humanich attacked a human?
Yes!

17:25.919 --> 17:28.130
Ethan pulled her circuits out
to save my life.

17:28.213 --> 17:29.256
{\an3}We decommissioned her.
We put her

17:29.339 --> 17:30.257
in a box.

17:30.340 --> 17:31.425
Someone overrode us

17:31.508 --> 17:33.886
and put her back
into operation.

17:36.013 --> 17:38.265
"Higher authority."

17:38.348 --> 17:39.475
What?

17:39.558 --> 17:43.187
Why haven't you gone
to Anna with this?

17:45.230 --> 17:48.025
The night John Woods died,

17:48.108 --> 17:50.611
I went to Anna and...

17:50.694 --> 17:53.614
I told her that he was thinking
about shutting us down.

17:53.697 --> 17:56.992
{\an5}ANNA:
Hello?
It's Julie.

17:57.076 --> 17:59.703
I think I may have
just really screwed up.

17:59.787 --> 18:01.371
Start from the beginning.

18:01.455 --> 18:03.290
I'll take care of it.

18:03.373 --> 18:06.168
Half an hour later,
he was dead.

18:09.213 --> 18:10.964
Anna's the only one
who could have put Lucy

18:11.048 --> 18:12.132
back into operation.

18:12.216 --> 18:14.718
{\an3}I mean, who else
could it be?

18:16.804 --> 18:19.723
I'll investigate this quietly,
but in the meantime,

18:19.807 --> 18:22.100
it has to stay between us.

18:22.184 --> 18:24.394
I'll look for Ethan,
make sure he's safe.

18:24.478 --> 18:25.979
(quietly):
Okay.

18:37.324 --> 18:38.742
SHEPHERD:
Computer access.

18:38.826 --> 18:42.246
Show me the latest file
on Nicholas Calderon.

18:44.957 --> 18:47.042
(sighs)

19:01.431 --> 19:03.141
Did I fall asleep?

19:03.225 --> 19:04.852
{\an3}You did.

19:04.935 --> 19:06.562
You needed it.

19:08.188 --> 19:13.110
Molly, we need to talk
about what I saw in that room.

19:15.654 --> 19:18.240
Your... your skin,

19:18.323 --> 19:20.117
I don't know,
it was like...

19:20.200 --> 19:24.037
it was like you had molted
or... or something.

19:24.121 --> 19:25.581
{\an1}I know.

19:25.664 --> 19:27.749
I'm changing.

19:27.833 --> 19:29.376
I've been given

19:29.459 --> 19:31.795
a second chance at life.

19:31.879 --> 19:33.755
I'm stronger.

19:33.839 --> 19:36.383
I'm more alive.

19:39.469 --> 19:41.930
And I saw things.

19:42.014 --> 19:44.266
What kind of things did you see?

19:47.185 --> 19:49.563
What did you do to me?

20:02.534 --> 20:04.077
(phone buzzes, chimes)

20:08.540 --> 20:10.459
It's Shepherd. He wants to meet.

20:10.542 --> 20:12.294
Screw Shepherd.
You can't leave here.

20:12.377 --> 20:13.962
Your face is everywhere.

20:14.046 --> 20:16.965
We finally have an ally
in this fight.

20:17.049 --> 20:18.342
Now that's progress.

20:18.425 --> 20:19.635
Can't you see that?

20:19.718 --> 20:21.094
Listen to me.

20:21.178 --> 20:22.930
All right? I know a guy.

20:23.013 --> 20:25.432
He runs a vanishing service.

20:25.515 --> 20:27.225
He's like
an international coyote.

20:27.309 --> 20:29.144
He can make us disappear.

20:29.227 --> 20:30.854
Disappear?

20:30.938 --> 20:32.314
To where?

20:32.397 --> 20:33.482
I don't care.

20:33.565 --> 20:35.484
Throw a dart at a map.

20:35.567 --> 20:37.319
Somewhere safe.

20:37.402 --> 20:39.446
There is no "safe"
until I see us

20:39.529 --> 20:41.865
{\an5}through this.
There is no "I"
here, Molly.

20:41.949 --> 20:43.492
We are in this together.

20:43.575 --> 20:45.494
(sighs softly)

20:47.079 --> 20:49.122
{\an1}(whispers):
I know.

20:49.206 --> 20:51.792
Right.

20:51.875 --> 20:55.295
You're not the only one that's
been given a second chance.

20:55.379 --> 20:56.964
{\an3}Look, I...

20:57.047 --> 20:58.882
I don't believe
in that "destiny" crap,

20:58.966 --> 21:01.134
I-I just don't.

21:01.218 --> 21:04.680
But when I add up all the things
that had to happen

21:04.763 --> 21:06.682
to bring us together...

21:06.765 --> 21:08.225
{\an3}(sighs)

21:08.308 --> 21:10.811
...that's all the proof I need

21:10.894 --> 21:14.022
to know that the universe...

21:14.106 --> 21:17.192
has a couple miracles
up its sleeve.

21:17.275 --> 21:19.820
Even for us.

21:22.489 --> 21:26.201
Well, the only way out...

21:26.284 --> 21:28.537
is to finish what we started.

21:31.164 --> 21:33.375
I got something for you.

21:39.131 --> 21:40.590
(sighs): You're
gonna need this.

21:40.674 --> 21:42.384
{\an3}You're gonna wear
it like a hood.

21:42.467 --> 21:43.969
{\an3}It's got a
reflective coating.

21:44.052 --> 21:45.846
{\an3}It'll block
facial recognition

21:45.929 --> 21:47.431
{\an3}from any kind of
security cams.

21:47.514 --> 21:49.099
{\an3}But it's not
gonna do anything

21:49.182 --> 21:51.685
if a Humanich spots you.

21:51.768 --> 21:53.603
This will.

21:55.022 --> 21:56.398
No. I...

21:56.481 --> 21:57.899
{\an3}Molly...
No.

21:57.983 --> 21:59.109
take it.

21:59.192 --> 22:01.028
I'm not gonna lose you again.

22:02.154 --> 22:04.197
(sighs)

22:05.615 --> 22:07.034
Okay.

Hello, Julie.

23:03.173 --> 23:04.508
I need to find Molly Woods.

23:04.591 --> 23:06.343
She died.

23:06.426 --> 23:07.928
You're lying.

23:08.011 --> 23:10.180
No, I saw her die
in the Faraday Wing at the GSC.

23:12.224 --> 23:15.310
There are cameras everywhere,
you know.

23:15.394 --> 23:17.395
You shouldn't have tried
to kill me.

23:17.479 --> 23:19.189
You were malfunctioning.

23:19.272 --> 23:21.149
{\an3}I shut you down. How...
How...

23:21.233 --> 23:23.026
could I be rebuilt and rebooted?

Is that what you want to know?

23:26.404 --> 23:29.032
That's classified.

23:30.617 --> 23:35.455
If I find out you lied,
I'm going to be very angry.

23:37.124 --> 23:39.626
Say hello to Ethan.

24:06.736 --> 24:09.114
Terra didn't set off
that bomb, Toby--

24:09.197 --> 24:11.074
{\an3}you have to believe me.
I know.

24:11.158 --> 24:14.744
A Humanich killed
Nate Malone today.

24:15.787 --> 24:17.330
No.

24:17.414 --> 24:19.332
That's not possible.

24:19.416 --> 24:22.210
The rules and protocols
for the A.I. programming

24:22.294 --> 24:24.045
don't allow that.

24:24.129 --> 24:26.339
The rules are being rewritten.

24:26.423 --> 24:27.424
By who?

24:27.507 --> 24:28.425
Nicholas Calderon.

24:28.508 --> 24:29.968
Now, what do you know

24:30.051 --> 24:31.261
{\an3}about him?

24:31.344 --> 24:33.555
Um, all I know
is that he and John

24:33.638 --> 24:35.056
created the Humanich prototype
together.

24:35.140 --> 24:37.225
{\an1}They had a huge
falling-out, and then...

24:37.309 --> 24:39.436
{\an3}His work took a turn
for the dramatic.

24:39.519 --> 24:41.855
{\an3}Blew up a defense building
in Wichita

24:41.938 --> 24:45.025
{\an3}a few years back, swore he was
just getting warmed up.

24:45.108 --> 24:46.234
Cal-der...

24:46.318 --> 24:47.694
Calder.

24:47.777 --> 24:50.322
Right before John died,
he left me a message.

24:50.405 --> 24:52.574
I thought he was going
to "call" somebody,

24:52.657 --> 24:54.743
but he was going to Calderon.

24:54.826 --> 24:56.411
{\an3}Maybe John

24:56.494 --> 25:00.373
stumbled upon his plan
to hijack the Humanichs program.

25:01.374 --> 25:02.918
So you think he killed him?

25:03.001 --> 25:05.795
Yeah. And he has
a greater scheme:

25:05.879 --> 25:08.256
{\an3}total subversion
of the Constitution,

25:08.340 --> 25:10.926
a complete coup,
without any fingerprints.

25:11.009 --> 25:12.928
To what end?

25:13.011 --> 25:15.388
Well, to stoke up enough fear
about the hybrid threat,

25:15.472 --> 25:18.391
and we'll create more and more
Humanichs to protect us.

25:18.475 --> 25:20.602
So the Humanichs are
now answering to Calderon?

25:20.685 --> 25:23.730
{\an6}Yeah.
But how could he know
about the hybrids?

25:23.813 --> 25:25.315
(laughs softly)

25:25.398 --> 25:28.235
He has an old friend
right down the hall from me,

25:28.318 --> 25:31.112
a perfect ally: Taylor.

25:31.196 --> 25:32.614
{\an6}Who?
A threat assessment
computer

25:32.697 --> 25:36.993
that he and John created for us,
way back.

25:37.077 --> 25:40.622
Calderon knows Taylor
like the back of his hand.

25:40.705 --> 25:44.292
We've had geniuses put in
firewall after firewall,

25:44.376 --> 25:46.336
{\an3}but he could just blow
right through that.

25:46.419 --> 25:50.173
So everything Taylor knows
is now in the hands of a madman?

25:50.257 --> 25:52.259
Yeah. Now I am

25:52.342 --> 25:55.345
gonna find Calderon
and I am gonna take him down.

25:55.428 --> 25:57.973
{\an3}But in the meantime, you,
Terra, JD and Ethan,

25:58.056 --> 25:59.474
you need to disappear.

25:59.557 --> 26:02.978
No more killing on my watch.

26:04.020 --> 26:06.189
You are a good man, Toby.

26:09.025 --> 26:10.277
Now...

26:11.695 --> 26:13.530
{\an3}Now, listen,
keep the phone.

26:13.613 --> 26:15.991
I'll call.

26:30.547 --> 26:32.549
Mr. Richter?

26:35.635 --> 26:37.846
Mr. Richter?

26:40.390 --> 26:41.641
I can't sleep.

26:41.725 --> 26:43.310
I tried powering down,

26:43.393 --> 26:46.646
{\an3}but I can't
for some reason.

26:46.730 --> 26:49.524
(sighs):
Yeah.

26:50.650 --> 26:52.193
Powering down.

26:52.277 --> 26:53.862
I get that.

26:55.822 --> 26:57.699
All right, well...

26:57.782 --> 27:00.035
what do you do...

27:00.118 --> 27:02.412
when you can't power down?

27:02.495 --> 27:04.247
Play a game.

27:04.331 --> 27:05.665
What kind of game?

27:05.749 --> 27:07.709
Spherical chess.

27:08.918 --> 27:11.421
(sighs):
Spherical chess.

27:11.504 --> 27:14.382
You lost me at "chess."

27:16.509 --> 27:19.095
Are you up for learning
something new?

27:19.179 --> 27:20.597
Always.

27:20.680 --> 27:22.265
Yeah?

27:22.349 --> 27:24.434
I have an idea.

27:24.517 --> 27:26.186
I raise you five chips.

27:26.269 --> 27:27.854
Five chips, huh?

27:27.937 --> 27:30.231
You trying to clean me out?

27:32.650 --> 27:34.736
All right.

27:34.819 --> 27:37.280
I call.

27:37.364 --> 27:39.199
Show 'em.

27:40.825 --> 27:43.203
{\an3}Full house,
jacks over twos.

27:45.163 --> 27:47.082
Texas hold 'em's really fun.

27:47.165 --> 27:50.126
I'm surprised you stayed in
with three twos.

27:51.336 --> 27:53.713
Yep, I'm surprised, too.

27:53.797 --> 27:56.925
Playing poker with a computer--
I should have my head examined.

27:59.010 --> 28:01.596
So, what are your intentions?

28:01.679 --> 28:03.473
Intentions?

28:03.556 --> 28:06.267
With my mom.

28:09.229 --> 28:10.814
Okay.

28:12.190 --> 28:14.651
My intentions
are to keep her, you,

28:14.734 --> 28:17.612
{\an1}and your friend
Terra there safe.

28:17.695 --> 28:19.531
How does that sound?

28:20.532 --> 28:22.450
Sounds...

28:22.534 --> 28:24.577
good.

28:24.661 --> 28:26.788
(slightly distorted):
G-G-G-Good.

28:26.871 --> 28:27.789
You okay, kid?

28:27.872 --> 28:30.583
I'm not feeling very well.

28:30.667 --> 28:32.377
Like what, like a stomachache?

28:34.003 --> 28:35.922
Excuse me.
I think I need to run

28:36.005 --> 28:36.923
(slowing):
a diagnostic.

28:37.006 --> 28:38.007
Ethan?

28:39.050 --> 28:40.093
Ethan!

28:47.350 --> 28:49.602
(knocking on door)

28:49.686 --> 28:50.937
{\an1}Something's wrong
with Ethan.

28:51.020 --> 28:53.356
Oh, my God.

28:53.440 --> 28:55.650
{\an4}Ethan...
He was running
some sort of diagnostic...

28:55.733 --> 28:56.818
Nobody left me

28:56.901 --> 28:58.319
a robot handbook.

28:58.403 --> 28:59.863
Ethan!

28:59.946 --> 29:01.156
Mom?

29:01.239 --> 29:02.824
{\an3}I'm...

29:02.907 --> 29:04.200
{\an3}overloaded.

29:04.284 --> 29:05.702
What's happening?

29:05.785 --> 29:08.329
(electronic whirr, blipping)

29:08.413 --> 29:09.831
He's burning up.

29:09.914 --> 29:12.000
{\an1}He's running
at 200% capacity.

29:12.083 --> 29:14.002
{\an3}Okay...

29:14.085 --> 29:16.004
I'm gonna have to protect
your neural net

29:16.087 --> 29:18.173
{\an1}from overloading,
so I'm gonna have to do

29:18.256 --> 29:20.341
a hard shutdown, okay?

29:20.425 --> 29:22.260
{\an1}You ready?

29:23.428 --> 29:25.013
(whirrs, powering down)

29:25.096 --> 29:26.014
If we don't

29:26.097 --> 29:27.182
get him help right away,

29:27.265 --> 29:28.349
he could have permanent damage.

29:28.433 --> 29:30.018
Terra, JD and I
are gonna have

29:30.101 --> 29:31.186
to take Ethan somewhere.

29:31.269 --> 29:32.187
I need you to stay here.

29:32.270 --> 29:33.146
Do not open the door.

29:33.229 --> 29:34.355
Do not make a peep.

29:34.439 --> 29:35.857
{\an1}We're gonna be back
in a few hours.

29:35.940 --> 29:37.025
Can you do that?

29:37.108 --> 29:38.026
Will he be okay?

29:38.109 --> 29:39.694
Yes. We're all
gonna be okay.

29:39.777 --> 29:41.488
{\an3}We're gonna leave here
first thing in the morning.

29:41.571 --> 29:42.572
Lock the door behind us.

29:45.950 --> 29:48.203
{\an4}Have you located
Molly Woods?
Not yet.

29:48.286 --> 29:51.331
But there's something
I'd like you to see.

29:51.414 --> 29:53.333
LUCY:
The hybrids knocked out

29:53.416 --> 29:56.044
most of our security cameras,
but the Virus Containment cam

29:56.127 --> 29:57.545
runs off auxiliary power.

29:57.629 --> 29:59.047
We found this reflection.

29:59.130 --> 30:01.382
LUCY:
Enhance 266 to 145.

30:01.466 --> 30:02.383
Stop.

30:02.467 --> 30:03.718
{\an3}Move in.

30:03.801 --> 30:04.886
Stop.

30:04.969 --> 30:06.346
Track 77 right.

30:06.429 --> 30:07.847
Stop.

30:07.931 --> 30:08.890
{\an3}Enhance 34

30:08.973 --> 30:10.850
to 44.

30:12.018 --> 30:13.269
Again.

30:16.689 --> 30:18.191
(sighs): Ah...

30:18.274 --> 30:20.276
{\an3}We have a traitor
in our midst,

30:20.360 --> 30:22.278
Madam Secretary.

30:27.659 --> 30:30.203
VERDISIGN:
Julie, you have a visitor.

30:30.286 --> 30:32.288
(knocking on door)

30:33.706 --> 30:35.041
Molly?

30:35.124 --> 30:36.876
Sorry we didn't call.

30:36.960 --> 30:38.127
We couldn't risk it.

30:38.211 --> 30:39.504
We need your help.

30:42.340 --> 30:45.468
{\an5}JULIE:
You did the right thing
in shutting him down.

30:45.552 --> 30:47.053
His processors
are not responding--

30:47.136 --> 30:48.596
like they're off
on another task

30:48.680 --> 30:50.974
{\an3}or something.
D-Do you think he's damaged?

30:51.057 --> 30:54.394
No. It'll take me some time
to restore his backup.

30:54.477 --> 30:56.229
We'll know more then.

30:56.312 --> 30:58.815
(computer beeping)

31:01.985 --> 31:03.736
Go make yourself a drink.

31:03.820 --> 31:05.446
Don't worry, I got this.

31:07.073 --> 31:08.950
(softly):
Okay.

31:10.159 --> 31:12.829
(sighs)

31:12.912 --> 31:14.414
(whirring)

31:14.497 --> 31:16.916
TAALR: Tobias Shepherd,
identification confirmed.

31:18.084 --> 31:20.670
Taylor,
what is the current status

31:20.753 --> 31:22.088
of Nicholas Calderon?

31:22.171 --> 31:23.590
Nicholas Calderon
has been a fugitive

31:23.673 --> 31:25.300
for the past seven years.

31:25.383 --> 31:28.803
Despite all our efforts,
his whereabouts are unknown.

31:28.886 --> 31:31.014
He designed you
along with John Woods.

31:31.097 --> 31:33.975
They made
the first iteration of me.

31:34.058 --> 31:36.644
The breadth of my capabilities

31:36.728 --> 31:39.147
has been improved upon
a billionfold since then.

31:39.230 --> 31:42.942
When was the last time
Calderon accessed you, Taylor?

31:46.529 --> 31:47.822
Taylor!

31:47.905 --> 31:49.824
I'm not at liberty to say,

31:49.907 --> 31:51.826
in light of your recent status.

31:51.909 --> 31:53.494
SHEPHERD:
Wh-What?

31:53.578 --> 31:55.830
Your clearance has been revoked.

31:55.913 --> 31:57.498
(alarm blaring)
My clearance?

31:57.582 --> 32:00.501
Due to the charges
brought against you.

32:00.585 --> 32:03.046
(alarm continues)

32:09.886 --> 32:11.137
(elevator bell chimes)

32:12.096 --> 32:13.640
Get him!

32:16.434 --> 32:18.353
{\an1}SHEPHERD:
Get off me!

32:18.436 --> 32:21.147
{\an6}Toby, you're
under arrest.
SHEPHERD: On what charge?

32:21.230 --> 32:24.067
Aiding and adhering to
a known enemy: treason.

32:26.986 --> 32:29.197
{\an3}So, Shepherd says
that Nicholas Calderon

32:29.280 --> 32:31.699
hijacked Humanichs...

32:31.783 --> 32:33.868
and killed John.

32:33.951 --> 32:36.037
Yeah.
And Toby's gonna find him.

32:36.120 --> 32:38.581
He's gonna shutter
the whole Humanichs project,

32:38.665 --> 32:41.876
and there's gonna be
no more hybrid kill squads.

32:41.959 --> 32:43.544
I wouldn't count on that, Molly.

32:43.628 --> 32:45.546
Okay. Well, at any rate...

32:45.630 --> 32:48.716
he told us we need to lay low,
get out of sight.

32:48.800 --> 32:50.885
{\an3}So those "vanishers"...
Yeah, yeah, yeah,

32:50.968 --> 32:52.887
those papers are ready
and waiting for us

32:52.970 --> 32:54.263
whenever we need them.

32:54.347 --> 32:56.391
(sighs):
Good.

33:01.604 --> 33:04.232
Molly, you said that

33:04.315 --> 33:07.110
{\an3}you saw some things when
you... when you died.

33:08.778 --> 33:10.947
What did you see?

33:14.117 --> 33:18.079
I went to a place
that I used to love...

33:18.162 --> 33:22.208
and I remembered some things
that I tried to forget.

33:22.291 --> 33:24.711
But you remember them now.

33:24.794 --> 33:27.422
Yeah.

33:27.505 --> 33:31.134
And I... I came to a place
of forgiveness.

33:35.179 --> 33:36.889
{\an3}Molly...

33:36.973 --> 33:38.850
you're not telling me something.

33:40.309 --> 33:43.730
{\an3}What is it? What...
What did you see?

33:48.276 --> 33:50.778
Molly...

33:50.862 --> 33:53.281
what did you do to me?

33:58.494 --> 34:01.330
{\an3}Hey. Molly.

34:01.414 --> 34:03.249
Talk to me.

34:05.585 --> 34:07.754
I saw you...

34:07.837 --> 34:09.797
and you were dying.

34:11.340 --> 34:13.926
And I think I killed you.

34:15.594 --> 34:17.972
All right, just so you know...

34:18.056 --> 34:19.931
you're definitely
not the first woman

34:20.016 --> 34:21.809
to have that particular dream.

34:22.768 --> 34:24.812
{\an3}No. No, no.

34:24.896 --> 34:26.813
That's all it is,
Molly, all right?

34:26.898 --> 34:29.150
That's... It was a dream.

34:29.233 --> 34:31.152
But what if it's not?

34:31.235 --> 34:33.696
JULIE:
Molly?

34:35.281 --> 34:37.324
(quiet electronic whirring)

34:39.034 --> 34:41.161
{\an1}MOLLY:
Wh-What's happening?

34:41.245 --> 34:43.414
{\an1}JULIE:
I-I don't know.

34:44.916 --> 34:46.125
{\an1}Mom.
Ethan.

34:47.126 --> 34:49.003
Are you okay?

34:49.085 --> 34:50.170
I have a message.

34:50.254 --> 34:51.839
From who?

34:51.922 --> 34:54.132
Dad.

35:03.601 --> 35:06.354
{\an5}Where is Molly Woods?
SHEPHERD:
She's not your problem.

35:06.437 --> 35:08.481
FIONA:
Illuminate me.

35:08.564 --> 35:10.650
Get rid of the guards.

35:12.944 --> 35:14.654
Out.

35:17.073 --> 35:18.866
Hybrids didn't

35:18.950 --> 35:20.701
blow up the Intelligence wing.

35:20.785 --> 35:22.537
I suppose it was ghosts.

35:22.620 --> 35:25.665
Yeah. Something like that.

35:25.748 --> 35:27.542
Nicholas Calderon.

35:27.625 --> 35:29.377
(chuckles)

35:29.460 --> 35:30.837
Calderon is the fever dream

35:30.920 --> 35:32.922
of every law enforcement agency
in this country.

35:33.005 --> 35:35.216
{\an3}Santa Claus would be
easier to find.

35:35.299 --> 35:39.011
Lucy was decommissioned
by Julie Gelineau.

35:39.095 --> 35:41.264
Did you recommission her?

35:41.347 --> 35:42.723
Because <i> I</i> didn't.

35:42.807 --> 35:44.016
The Humanichs

35:44.100 --> 35:47.186
have been taken over
by Calderon.

35:47.270 --> 35:48.271
He's giving them

35:48.354 --> 35:50.064
direct commands.

35:50.147 --> 35:51.899
He's inside their head.

35:51.983 --> 35:53.401
And who's in yours?

35:53.484 --> 35:54.735
What?

35:54.819 --> 35:56.904
When Shayna Velez resigned,
she sent me

35:56.988 --> 35:59.740
a note warning me of your
obsession with Molly Woods.

35:59.824 --> 36:00.741
(groans)

36:00.825 --> 36:01.993
She said your judgment

36:02.076 --> 36:03.244
had been compromised.

36:03.327 --> 36:05.788
I should have taken
it more seriously.

36:05.872 --> 36:08.958
We've all been compromised.

36:09.041 --> 36:10.543
We've been playing

36:10.626 --> 36:11.919
Calderon's game.

36:12.003 --> 36:14.463
He's pulling the strings.

36:15.172 --> 36:16.173
Fiona...

36:19.969 --> 36:22.638
We're on the wrong side
in this war.

36:22.722 --> 36:25.308
{\an1}He ginned up
the hybrid threat to launch

36:25.391 --> 36:28.269
a worldwide
Humanichs revolution.

36:29.520 --> 36:30.938
Can't you see?

36:31.022 --> 36:34.025
{\an1}Peace with the hybrids
is the only way.

36:34.108 --> 36:36.277
There's no virus
that can kill them all.

36:36.360 --> 36:38.279
And those that remain
will procreate,

36:38.362 --> 36:41.157
and the madness
will just start all over again.

36:41.240 --> 36:42.450
Pretty soon,

36:42.533 --> 36:43.659
we'll have a police state

36:43.743 --> 36:44.994
run by Humanichs,

36:45.077 --> 36:47.204
controlled...

36:47.288 --> 36:49.290
by Nicholas Calderon.

36:53.419 --> 36:56.130
You need a good lawyer, Toby...

36:56.213 --> 36:57.214
and a better psychiatrist.

37:05.932 --> 37:08.684
As the nation mourns the victims
of the GSC bombing,

37:08.768 --> 37:10.478
anti-terrorist units
have been deployed

37:10.561 --> 37:12.480
in a worldwide search
for the bombers.

37:12.563 --> 37:14.148
{\an5}In a statement
from the White House,
(knocking on door)

37:14.231 --> 37:15.983
officials said, quote,

37:16.067 --> 37:17.818
"We will hunt down
these cowards at all costs.

37:17.902 --> 37:20.279
Justice will be
swift and severe."

37:23.074 --> 37:25.326
Hello, little dove.

37:25.409 --> 37:26.827
It's time to come home.

37:26.911 --> 37:28.829
SHEPHERD:
<i>Edward?</i>

37:28.913 --> 37:31.165
{\an5}Yes, sir.
Uh, is this your
third tour with me now?

37:31.248 --> 37:32.833
Fourth.

37:32.917 --> 37:34.669
{\an3}You ever know me to
violate the code of honor?

37:34.752 --> 37:37.129
{\an6}No sir.
Then would you
do me the favor

37:37.213 --> 37:39.966
{\an3}of letting me walk these halls
one last time with dignity?

37:40.049 --> 37:41.842
{\an3}Sir...
Come on, I'm asking.

37:41.926 --> 37:44.053
Soldier to soldier.

37:44.136 --> 37:47.306
And what kind of soldier
would I be if I did that?

37:49.725 --> 37:51.894
Well, not my kind.

37:51.978 --> 37:53.688
Let's go.

38:01.112 --> 38:02.613
JOHN'S VOICE:
Molly?

38:03.614 --> 38:04.991
This is John.

38:07.326 --> 38:09.870
If you're listening to this,
it means I'm dead.

38:11.455 --> 38:12.873
I built this message into Ethan

38:12.957 --> 38:15.710
in the event
of a worst-case scenario.

38:15.793 --> 38:17.294
That scenario has happened.

38:18.796 --> 38:20.381
A Humanich has killed
a human being

38:20.464 --> 38:23.217
and breached the
primary protocol.

38:23.300 --> 38:27.179
This is a harbinger
of, uh, greater crimes to come.

38:28.806 --> 38:31.809
There's only one thing
that can stop them.

38:35.479 --> 38:38.357
The person who has been
entrusted with guarding this

38:38.441 --> 38:41.193
is Nicholas Calderon.

38:41.277 --> 38:43.904
He's your only hope.

38:43.988 --> 38:45.990
(Ethan collapses onto bed)

39:04.175 --> 39:06.469
Which is it?

39:06.552 --> 39:09.972
{\an1}Is Calderon the savior
or the devil?

39:10.056 --> 39:12.099
Maybe he's both.

39:15.352 --> 39:18.314

39:20.024 --> 39:23.652
