11:43.206 --> 11:44.840
Now, that in and of itself

11:44.874 --> 11:46.975
is grounds for dismissal

11:47.010 --> 11:48.477
from the force.

11:48.511 --> 11:49.845
So my question to you is

11:49.879 --> 11:51.446
who was on guard duty

11:51.481 --> 11:53.315
outside of interrogation this morning?

11:55.985 --> 11:57.686
No idea, man.

11:57.720 --> 12:00.055
<i>GORDON: Nobody's talking.</i>

12:00.089 --> 12:01.990
They're protecting their own.

12:02.025 --> 12:03.458
Or they just don't like you.

12:03.493 --> 12:05.093
Face it, Harvey.

12:05.128 --> 12:07.896
Leon Winkler's killer is a cop.

12:07.931 --> 12:09.832
Not proven.

12:09.866 --> 12:11.300
Come on, you know these guys.

12:11.334 --> 12:12.701
You've known them since way back.

12:12.735 --> 12:14.837
Give me some leverage. Give me an angle.

12:16.573 --> 12:18.640
You really want to work with a murderer?

12:22.378 --> 12:25.481
Somebody gets whacked in the GCPD.

12:25.515 --> 12:26.915
Somebody's gonna get fired for this.

12:26.950 --> 12:28.050
(scoffs) Not me, pal.

12:28.084 --> 12:29.818
Grover.

12:31.821 --> 12:33.822
We got a reliable guy

12:33.857 --> 12:35.624
says it was you pulled the page

12:35.658 --> 12:36.992
from the guard duty logbook.

12:37.026 --> 12:39.328
No way. W
- Where did you get that?

12:39.362 --> 12:41.497
- Who said that?
- Alvarez.

12:41.531 --> 12:44.333
If he said that, that
son of a bitch is lying.

12:44.367 --> 12:45.701
Why would he lie?

12:45.735 --> 12:47.002
Look, six years ago,

12:47.036 --> 12:48.737
I had a thing with his wife, okay?

12:48.771 --> 12:50.672
Six years ago.

12:50.707 --> 12:52.140
He is a vindictive bastard.

12:52.175 --> 12:54.576
Well, look, that's none
of our business, huh?

12:56.112 --> 12:58.213
Look at it from our point of view.

12:58.248 --> 13:01.183
We got to find the culprit.

13:01.217 --> 13:02.651
Brass demands one.

13:02.685 --> 13:04.253
But it wasn't me.

13:04.287 --> 13:06.221
Then who was it?

13:12.362 --> 13:14.563
Delaware? Anybody seen Delaware?

13:14.597 --> 13:17.266
Saw him go to the garage.

13:20.069 --> 13:21.837
Hey. Delaware.

13:21.871 --> 13:23.372
Hey!

13:27.911 --> 13:30.045
(engine starts) Hey!

13:30.079 --> 13:32.381
(tires screeching)

13:33.249 --> 13:35.684
You're gonna regret that.

13:35.718 --> 13:37.052
You were guarding interrogation
this morning, weren't you?

13:37.086 --> 13:38.387
Screw off.

14:05.782 --> 14:07.783
♪ ♪

14:29.172 --> 14:30.672
(grunts)

14:36.813 --> 14:38.147
BULLOCK: Jim.

14:38.181 --> 14:39.615
What the hell are you doing?

14:39.649 --> 14:41.283
You couldn't bring him in here quietly,

14:41.317 --> 14:43.318
put him in some back room?

14:43.353 --> 14:44.953
You making some kind of statement?

14:46.389 --> 14:48.390
Damn right I am.

14:59.720 --> 15:02.322
I warned you and you didn't listen.

15:02.356 --> 15:04.357
I have evidence: the same drugs

15:04.391 --> 15:05.558
I found in Littlefield's shoe

15:05.593 --> 15:07.861
at the crime scene yesterday morning.

15:07.895 --> 15:09.629
That evidence is part of an ongoing

15:09.663 --> 15:11.531
undercover narco investigation.

15:11.565 --> 15:13.032
You expect us to believe that?

15:13.067 --> 15:16.002
Jim, narco's been knee-deep
in the Uptown drug trade

15:16.036 --> 15:17.770
for months.

15:17.805 --> 15:19.706
I've got a matrix of undercovers
that have put their lives

15:19.740 --> 15:21.040
at stake for this investigation.

15:21.075 --> 15:23.510
Your little stunt gets out, you unravel

15:23.544 --> 15:24.544
the whole operation.

15:24.578 --> 15:26.713
Not to mention, the search was illegal.

15:26.747 --> 15:28.982
So we're ignoring Delaware's
involvement in Winkler's death?

15:29.016 --> 15:30.550
Is that what we're doing, Cap?

15:30.584 --> 15:33.319
No. But this isn't the way, Jim.

15:33.354 --> 15:35.288
I'm turning over the
case to Internal Affairs.

15:35.322 --> 15:37.157
I.A.?

15:37.191 --> 15:38.791
Two old drunks in the basement.

15:38.826 --> 15:39.959
You and Bullock

15:39.994 --> 15:42.896
are no longer investigating
the Winkler murder.

15:42.930 --> 15:44.264
What about the Littlefield murder?

15:44.298 --> 15:46.833
Or, wait, is that also a part of an ongoing

15:46.867 --> 15:48.568
narco investigation?

15:48.602 --> 15:51.337
All you, buddy. Let me
know if you need any help.

15:53.207 --> 15:55.575
I'm sorry about the confusion.

16:04.185 --> 16:05.351
(gasps)

16:08.522 --> 16:10.523
Can I help you with something?

16:10.558 --> 16:13.226
Did you know, Miss Kringle,
that the earliest greeting cards

16:13.260 --> 16:14.894
dated back to Germany in the 1400s?

16:14.929 --> 16:17.597
I have a lot of work to do.

16:17.631 --> 16:18.898
This is for you.

16:18.933 --> 16:22.035
Doesn't say anything weird, does it?

16:22.069 --> 16:23.102
No, ma'am.

16:37.251 --> 16:38.651
(giggles)

16:51.832 --> 16:53.066
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

16:53.100 --> 16:54.868
Take it easy. (sighs)

16:54.902 --> 16:56.069
Take it easy.

16:56.103 --> 16:58.271
I'm fine, Butch.

16:58.305 --> 17:00.440
Here, try this.

17:03.844 --> 17:05.310
(sighs)

17:05.346 --> 17:06.579
You okay?

17:06.614 --> 17:08.114
I'm starving.

17:08.148 --> 17:10.116
(laughs)

17:10.151 --> 17:12.152
(thunder rumbling softly)

17:12.185 --> 17:14.521
(sighs) You are one tough cookie.

17:20.461 --> 17:21.961
Thank you, Butch.

17:25.465 --> 17:27.433
Listen, we should hit the road.

17:27.468 --> 17:28.935
I figure we've got about
an hour before Falcone...

17:28.969 --> 17:32.639
Oh, I'm not going anywhere
until I find Penguin.

17:32.673 --> 17:34.674
He's the one that told Falcone about Liza.

17:34.708 --> 17:36.776
Whoa, whoa, whoa, boss, I
don't know if you remember,

17:36.811 --> 17:38.978
but as of last night,
we don't have any men.

17:39.013 --> 17:41.281
Falcone's gonna have the
whole city looking for us.

17:41.315 --> 17:47.387
I'm not going anywhere
until I cut Penguin's throat.

17:49.156 --> 17:54.194
One... two... three.

17:54.228 --> 17:55.562
(gasps)

17:58.332 --> 18:01.301
What do you think, Mother?

18:01.335 --> 18:05.004
Oh, it's beautiful.

18:05.039 --> 18:07.540
So classy.

18:09.543 --> 18:11.478
Like an opera house.

18:11.512 --> 18:14.047
(cork pops) (gasps) Oh.

18:14.081 --> 18:17.016
(laughs)

18:21.455 --> 18:23.256
(sighs)

18:23.290 --> 18:25.925
A chandelier.

18:25.960 --> 18:27.160
Like home.

18:27.194 --> 18:28.428
(chuckles)

18:28.462 --> 18:29.696
(gasps)

18:30.731 --> 18:35.068
Someone left a scarf.

18:37.304 --> 18:39.405
It's beautiful with my dress.

18:39.440 --> 18:40.740
(chuckles)

18:40.774 --> 18:42.442
Finders keepers.

18:42.476 --> 18:47.180
And now you are in charge of this club?

18:47.214 --> 18:49.082
(thunder rumbling softly)

18:49.116 --> 18:51.551
Spoiled my surprise.

18:51.585 --> 18:53.586
<i>No. Oh, no, no, liebchen.</i>

18:53.621 --> 18:55.688
No, don't be angry. No.

18:55.723 --> 18:58.024
Such good news.

18:58.058 --> 19:00.426
My boy has a club.

19:00.461 --> 19:02.595
<i>Will have a club.</i>

19:02.630 --> 19:04.898
There's still a few loose ends to tie up,

19:04.932 --> 19:08.134
but... soon it will be mine. (laughs)

19:08.169 --> 19:12.705
I am so proud of you...

19:12.740 --> 19:15.442
I could spit.

19:15.476 --> 19:18.244
(both laugh)

19:18.279 --> 19:21.147
<i>BULLOCK: Listen, Jim, there's
something I got to tell you.</i>

19:21.182 --> 19:23.583
A few years ago, Flass and his people

19:23.617 --> 19:27.887
started busting drug dealers,
taking over their stash houses,

19:27.922 --> 19:31.090
running them themselves.

19:31.125 --> 19:32.959
Now?

19:32.993 --> 19:34.961
You tell me this now?

19:34.995 --> 19:36.629
Look, I respond to crises as they arise.

19:36.664 --> 19:38.731
I'm not a forward planner like
you. I didn't tell you then

19:38.766 --> 19:40.767
because I didn't want to
get you all riled you up,

19:40.801 --> 19:44.003
but I'm telling you now
because I want you to stop.

19:46.307 --> 19:49.642
Flass is protected.

19:49.677 --> 19:52.178
By who?

19:52.213 --> 19:54.013
Serious people.

19:54.048 --> 19:56.583
Really high up. Big money.

19:56.617 --> 19:58.685
For all I know, the
commissioner gets a piece, too.

19:58.719 --> 20:01.321
You mess with Flass, you can
forget going back to Arkham.

20:01.355 --> 20:02.322
These guys

20:02.356 --> 20:03.623
do not play.

20:06.327 --> 20:08.294
These stash houses-

20:08.329 --> 20:10.296
think you can get me a location on them?

20:10.331 --> 20:12.098
Did you not hear a word I just said?

20:12.133 --> 20:14.300
The stash houses could give
us evidence linking Flass

20:14.335 --> 20:15.702
to Littlefield's murder.

20:15.736 --> 20:17.971
We nail him for Littlefield,
we can nail him for Winkler.

20:18.005 --> 20:19.806
I can't let it be, Harvey.

20:21.809 --> 20:23.309
You should know that by now.

20:34.855 --> 20:36.823
Mick, it's Harv.

20:36.857 --> 20:39.025
You know that thing you
and Donnie were working on?

20:39.059 --> 20:40.226
The Flass thing?

20:40.261 --> 20:43.063
I need your help.

20:55.843 --> 20:57.811
Prime spot for a stash house.

20:57.845 --> 20:59.846
Yeah.

21:14.395 --> 21:15.895
GORDON: Delaware,

21:15.930 --> 21:18.198
hand over the boxes.

21:20.201 --> 21:22.168
You don't learn, do you?

21:22.203 --> 21:23.269
Get out of my face.

21:30.311 --> 21:33.213
Hey. Hey!

21:33.247 --> 21:34.781
No need to

21:34.815 --> 21:36.282
rough each other up, gentlemen.

21:36.317 --> 21:37.917
I got a warrant.

21:37.952 --> 21:40.754
Giving us the legal right
to search and seizure.

21:40.788 --> 21:43.390
Seems this warehouse was
being used as a home base

21:43.424 --> 21:44.924
by the Uptown Assassins.

21:44.959 --> 21:46.860
You expect us to believe you got

21:46.894 --> 21:49.029
a signed warrant to clear
your own stash house?

21:49.063 --> 21:51.631
On the commissioner's request.

21:51.665 --> 21:55.468
Signed by Judge Bam-Bam.

21:56.671 --> 22:00.507
Guess you don't have a leg to stand on...

22:00.541 --> 22:02.409
homicide.

22:16.696 --> 22:18.897
- So what's our next step?
- Next step?

22:18.931 --> 22:21.967
We got nothing to tie Flass
to the drugs or the murders.

22:22.001 --> 22:23.969
Murder.

22:24.003 --> 22:25.637
Just one.

22:25.671 --> 22:29.441
Internal Affairs just ruled
Winkler's death as a suicide.

22:29.475 --> 22:31.143
They're releasing the body

22:31.177 --> 22:32.444
to his wife.

22:33.813 --> 22:36.281
Leon was so very happy.

22:36.315 --> 22:40.152
(crying): This just can't
be right. Can't be...

22:44.123 --> 22:45.557
A suicide?

22:45.591 --> 22:47.726
He stabbed himself in
the back with an ice pick?

22:47.760 --> 22:49.127
That's absurd!

22:49.162 --> 22:51.763
A ruling this quick means
the commissioner was involved.

22:51.798 --> 22:53.098
Screw the commissioner.

22:53.132 --> 22:56.201
Going forward with this
puts all of our jobs at risk.

22:56.235 --> 22:58.036
Look,

22:58.070 --> 22:59.371
I want to help you, Jim.

22:59.405 --> 23:01.940
There are people here in
GCPD who want to help you.

23:01.974 --> 23:03.842
- So why don't they?
- They have.

23:03.876 --> 23:05.811
I have.

23:05.845 --> 23:07.946
And we learned the hard way.

23:07.980 --> 23:10.882
With men like Flass,
you need more than words.

23:10.917 --> 23:12.117
You need results.

23:12.151 --> 23:13.785
And that's not gonna
happen this time around.

23:13.820 --> 23:15.687
So do us all a favor and move on

23:15.721 --> 23:17.489
to the next vic.

23:17.523 --> 23:19.491
Please.

23:29.535 --> 23:31.536
(sobbing softly)

23:40.279 --> 23:42.047
Where you going?

23:42.081 --> 23:44.082
Back in an hour.

23:47.019 --> 23:48.920
Listen to this. This is classic.

23:48.955 --> 23:50.088
Stop it. Come on.

23:50.123 --> 23:51.890
Hey. Come on.

23:51.924 --> 23:53.892
"Dear Miss Kringle,

23:53.926 --> 23:57.863
"your eyes are as green as a meadow.

23:57.897 --> 24:00.432
"Your smile is as bright as the sun.

24:00.466 --> 24:03.535
"Your skin is as white as a snowflake.

24:03.569 --> 24:06.104
It seems like your life is fun. "

24:06.139 --> 24:08.740
(laughter)

24:08.775 --> 24:11.042
- Really?
- Oh, hey!

24:11.077 --> 24:12.310
It's the writer himself. Whew.

24:12.345 --> 24:14.679
(laughter)

24:14.714 --> 24:17.616
It's a real piece of
work you got there, perv.

24:17.650 --> 24:19.451
I wouldn't quit your day job if I were you.

24:19.485 --> 24:21.353
Roger, dodger.

24:21.387 --> 24:23.889
- Roger, dodger?
- Stop it.

24:23.923 --> 24:25.257
(chuckles)

24:25.291 --> 24:26.958
What a creep.

24:26.993 --> 24:28.994
(laughter)

24:33.800 --> 24:37.569
One, two, three. One, two, three.

24:37.603 --> 24:39.604
One, two, three. One...

24:39.639 --> 24:43.108
(laughs) Now... now you are getting it.

24:43.142 --> 24:48.814
You are so graceful for such a big man.

24:48.848 --> 24:50.849
Isn't he graceful, Oswald?

24:50.883 --> 24:53.785
Yes, Mother.

24:56.489 --> 24:58.657
Jim.

24:58.691 --> 24:59.858
Welcome.

25:01.327 --> 25:02.494
Come in.

25:06.365 --> 25:09.768
Another handsome man at the party.

25:09.802 --> 25:11.870
I am so lucky.

25:11.904 --> 25:13.872
This is Jim Gordon,

25:13.906 --> 25:15.440
the detective friend

25:15.475 --> 25:16.942
I was telling you about.

25:16.976 --> 25:19.911
Oh. So nice to meet

25:19.946 --> 25:21.780
a friend of Oswald's.

25:21.814 --> 25:24.616
I am Gertrud Kapelput.

25:24.650 --> 25:27.719
Nice to meet you, too, Mrs. Kapelput.

25:27.753 --> 25:29.087
Mmm.

25:29.122 --> 25:31.022
(chuckles) Mother,

25:31.057 --> 25:32.557
Jim and I have very important

25:32.592 --> 25:34.126
business. No.

25:34.160 --> 25:36.061
Oh, sad. Oh, how sad.

25:37.130 --> 25:38.830
(chuckles) A little soon

25:38.865 --> 25:40.499
to be celebrating, don't you think?

25:40.533 --> 25:42.601
Well, don't just stand there.

25:42.635 --> 25:43.535
Sit.

25:43.569 --> 25:45.137
This won't take long.

25:45.171 --> 25:47.172
I insist. Sit.

25:47.206 --> 25:49.875
(Gertrud laughing, gentle music playing)

25:49.909 --> 25:51.476
(chuckles)

25:51.511 --> 25:54.079
I'm so very glad you called, Jim Gordon.

25:54.113 --> 25:56.982
It's been far too long
since we've seen each other.

25:57.016 --> 25:59.084
I was beginning to think
you'd rgotten about me.

25:59.118 --> 26:01.186
I need a favor.

26:01.220 --> 26:02.788
Do you know anything about

26:02.822 --> 26:05.056
a narcotics detective by
the name of Arnold Flass?

26:05.091 --> 26:07.192
I've heard the name.

26:07.226 --> 26:09.327
I'm investigating him
and his crew for murder,

26:09.362 --> 26:10.729
but I've hit a wall.

26:10.763 --> 26:12.998
He's too well-connected. I figured since

26:13.032 --> 26:14.933
Maroni runs the drug trade,

26:14.967 --> 26:18.170
maybe you could find somebody
with the goods on Flass?

26:18.204 --> 26:19.371
But...

26:19.405 --> 26:22.808
Shh. Say no more.

26:22.842 --> 26:24.676
Favor is done.

26:24.710 --> 26:26.912
I'll make some calls.

26:26.946 --> 26:29.448
And what do I owe you in return?

26:29.482 --> 26:31.550
Friends don't owe friends, silly.

26:31.584 --> 26:35.053
They just do favors because they want to.

26:35.088 --> 26:37.589
(chuckles): Because they're friends.

26:37.623 --> 26:39.925
Nobody gets hurt. Of course.

26:39.959 --> 26:41.626
No one gets hurt.

26:44.931 --> 26:47.799
Champagne.

26:51.404 --> 26:53.171
(chuckles)

26:55.942 --> 26:58.176
(laughing)

27:08.020 --> 27:10.155
(guttural gasping)

27:10.189 --> 27:12.090
ZSASZ: Oh, dear me.

27:12.125 --> 27:14.126
What happened here?

27:14.160 --> 27:16.728
Call Falcone.

27:16.762 --> 27:17.729
No kidding.

27:21.834 --> 27:23.368
(laughs)

27:23.402 --> 27:24.402
Thank you.

27:24.437 --> 27:26.204
Thank you, boys. Lovely. (music stops)

27:26.239 --> 27:28.907
No. I-I am dancing still. Shh.

27:28.941 --> 27:32.410
You may go. Oh, why you make them go?

27:32.445 --> 27:36.381
Gabe, on your way to
help my dear friend Jim,

27:36.415 --> 27:40.485
could you be a gentleman
and take Mother home?

27:40.520 --> 27:42.654
Sure thing, boss.

27:42.688 --> 27:44.389
Come on, Mrs. K.

27:44.423 --> 27:45.957
A palace.

27:45.992 --> 27:47.859
My boy has a palace.

27:47.894 --> 27:51.763
Such a good boy.

27:51.798 --> 27:54.633
Don't worry.

27:54.667 --> 27:57.035
I will be back.

28:04.844 --> 28:08.447
(laughs)

28:20.460 --> 28:21.993
(laughs)

28:23.796 --> 28:25.797
♪ ♪

28:45.051 --> 28:48.420
Ladies and gentlemen, friends,

28:48.454 --> 28:51.890
celebrities from around the world,

28:51.924 --> 28:55.527
my name is Oswald Cobblepot.

28:55.561 --> 28:56.528
(chuckles)

28:56.562 --> 28:58.296
Here we are at last.

28:58.331 --> 29:01.399
It is with deep and sincere pleasure

29:01.434 --> 29:04.703
that I bid you welcome to
the official grand opening

29:04.737 --> 29:06.805
of my newest night spot, the...

29:06.839 --> 29:07.906
(clapping)

29:07.940 --> 29:10.876
(microphone feedback squeals)

29:10.910 --> 29:13.278
Not bad.

29:13.312 --> 29:15.881
I do believe you need to project more.

29:15.915 --> 29:19.684
Just to create a bit more
excitement for the audience.

29:19.719 --> 29:22.854
Ladies and gentlemen,

29:22.889 --> 29:27.492
welcome to Fish Mooney's!

29:29.095 --> 29:30.929
Like that.

29:52.640 --> 29:53.973
What kind of

29:54.008 --> 29:56.409
weirdo plays chess with himself?

29:58.813 --> 30:02.615
Don't you have a butler to do
that kind of stuff with you?

30:02.650 --> 30:04.551
He's making lunch.

30:04.585 --> 30:05.752
I got your message.

30:05.786 --> 30:07.387
I'm glad you're safe.

30:08.489 --> 30:10.890
Alfred made me go out of town.

30:10.925 --> 30:13.693
Switzerland. We have a house there.

30:13.728 --> 30:15.261
Chalet, I guess.

30:15.296 --> 30:16.629
A chalet?

30:16.664 --> 30:18.231
It's basically a house.

30:18.265 --> 30:19.733
Why did you want to see me?

30:19.767 --> 30:22.002
We're friends, aren't we?

30:22.036 --> 30:24.504
You've been driving around looking for me,

30:24.538 --> 30:27.340
sending messages. What's up?

30:33.648 --> 30:35.649
I got you a present.

30:47.695 --> 30:49.362
It looks like the town we stayed in.

30:49.397 --> 30:51.865
Whoa.

30:51.899 --> 30:53.500
Thank you.

30:53.534 --> 30:57.604
Also, I wanted to know if,
um... if you wanted to stay here

30:57.638 --> 30:59.039
in my house.

30:59.073 --> 31:00.640
Why?

31:00.675 --> 31:02.809
I figure we can help each other out.

31:02.843 --> 31:05.378
You can help me find the
man who killed my parents,

31:05.413 --> 31:08.515
and I can give you a better place to live.

31:08.549 --> 31:10.684
What's better about it?

31:15.389 --> 31:19.459
Listen kid... chill.

31:19.493 --> 31:21.595
I came here to tell
you to stop hassling me.

31:25.333 --> 31:27.267
Hassling you?

31:27.301 --> 31:29.669
Yeah.

31:29.704 --> 31:31.371
You're beginning to bug me.

31:33.407 --> 31:36.142
I thought we were friends.

31:37.178 --> 31:40.780
Listen, I lied.

31:40.815 --> 31:43.083
I... didn't see who killed your parents.

31:43.117 --> 31:45.118
I didn't see his face.

31:45.152 --> 31:46.987
I don't understand.

31:47.021 --> 31:49.489
I lied so I wouldn't
get locked up in juvie.

31:49.523 --> 31:50.924
So it's no use

31:50.958 --> 31:53.126
buying me presents or sending me messages

31:53.160 --> 31:54.394
or trying to hang out.

31:54.428 --> 31:56.429
There's no point because I can't help you.

32:03.938 --> 32:06.339
(window closes)

32:08.442 --> 32:10.877
Pinky Littlefield was
light two weeks running.

32:10.912 --> 32:12.679
If you don't pay up, there's consequences.

32:12.713 --> 32:14.447
Flass killed him to send a message.

32:14.482 --> 32:16.516
But please, please! I
swear that's all I know.

32:16.550 --> 32:17.350
You sure?

32:17.385 --> 32:19.119
I swear, man, I swear!

32:19.153 --> 32:21.087
I believe you.

32:21.122 --> 32:24.424
(gasping)

32:24.458 --> 32:26.526
But I think I'll need
something a bit more tangible.

32:26.561 --> 32:28.495
No, no, no! Please, no!

32:28.529 --> 32:29.963
No! No! Please, no!

32:29.997 --> 32:32.732
I swear, man! I swear!

32:34.769 --> 32:36.136
(panting)

32:36.170 --> 32:38.638
How are you liking show business now?

32:38.673 --> 32:40.106
Please, Miss Mooney.

32:40.141 --> 32:41.775
You're making a mistake.

32:42.510 --> 32:44.144
(grunting)

32:44.178 --> 32:46.746
I
- I beg of you, let me speak.

32:46.781 --> 32:48.481
I know we've had our differences.

32:48.516 --> 32:49.449
Hmm.

32:49.483 --> 32:52.819
We could combine our forces.

32:52.853 --> 32:54.888
Think how'd we fool everyone.

32:54.922 --> 32:57.424
Me... work with you?

32:58.793 --> 33:00.794
I found you.

33:00.828 --> 33:04.631
I made you.

33:04.665 --> 33:08.602
When you walked in here, you
were a sad little wannabe.

33:08.636 --> 33:10.470
Remember that, Butch?

33:11.772 --> 33:13.640
You were so afraid.

33:13.674 --> 33:15.442
Shook like a leaf in fall.

33:15.476 --> 33:18.078
You're a servant.

33:18.112 --> 33:20.580
An umbrella boy.

33:20.615 --> 33:24.150
You're... a nobody.

33:26.153 --> 33:29.823
This nobody still
outfoxed you at every turn.

33:31.893 --> 33:34.961
I was working for Falcone the whole time!

33:34.996 --> 33:37.697
And you didn't have the sense to see it!

33:41.135 --> 33:42.102
(gunshot)

33:42.136 --> 33:43.370
ZSASZ: Hello.

33:43.404 --> 33:46.773
Seems like Mooney's is
the place to be today.

33:59.754 --> 34:01.521
(grunts)

34:01.556 --> 34:02.389
GILZEAN: Come on, come on!

34:02.423 --> 34:04.357
No! Come on!

34:13.668 --> 34:15.668
(laughing)

34:26.047 --> 34:28.047
Go, go, go!

34:44.764 --> 34:46.266
Here.

34:47.869 --> 34:48.935
(grunts loudly)

34:54.442 --> 34:55.442
You got to go!

34:55.476 --> 34:56.909
I'll slow them down.

34:56.944 --> 34:58.845
No, no! Go!

35:08.656 --> 35:10.624
Hello again.

35:12.260 --> 35:13.693
(yells)

35:13.728 --> 35:15.462
(groans)

35:20.334 --> 35:21.768
Where is she?

35:21.803 --> 35:25.272
(laughs quietly)

35:27.141 --> 35:28.809
What do you think, girls?

35:28.843 --> 35:31.344
Should we kill him...

35:31.379 --> 35:33.747
or should we take him home to play with?

35:58.843 --> 36:01.378
(clears throat)

36:01.413 --> 36:02.913
Mr. Nygma?

36:04.949 --> 36:06.216
Miss Kringle.

36:06.251 --> 36:07.651
Am I interrupting?

36:07.686 --> 36:09.620
Yes. I'm surgically removing the onions

36:09.654 --> 36:11.889
from my takeout, so if you don't mind...

36:11.923 --> 36:14.658
Mr. Nygma, I owe you an apology.

36:14.693 --> 36:16.927
I didn't give

36:16.961 --> 36:19.363
Arnold the card.

36:19.397 --> 36:21.298
He found it in my desk.

36:22.500 --> 36:24.635
He has a strange sense of humor.

36:24.669 --> 36:27.271
I thought your card was...

36:27.305 --> 36:29.306
very...

36:29.341 --> 36:31.475
um...

36:31.509 --> 36:33.477
thoughtful.

36:33.511 --> 36:34.912
I guess.

36:34.946 --> 36:37.414
Anyway, I'm sorry.

36:39.451 --> 36:41.318
Miss Kringle, would you...

36:41.353 --> 36:43.420
No, no, no, no, no. Please,
don't say anything else.

36:43.455 --> 36:45.289
Just, please.

36:50.729 --> 36:53.297
There's hope.

36:58.136 --> 36:59.937
What's this?

36:59.971 --> 37:02.773
Murder weapon and a tape of
Delaware rolling on Flass.

37:02.807 --> 37:04.675
Smart cookie, that one.

37:04.709 --> 37:06.977
Flass gave him the ice pick to throw away.

37:07.012 --> 37:09.513
Delaware kept it in case
he had to cover his own ass.

37:10.548 --> 37:12.516
Thank you.

37:12.550 --> 37:14.551
You're welcome.

37:28.767 --> 37:31.035
(quiet chatter, laughter)

37:35.707 --> 37:37.708
(sobbing softly)

37:45.550 --> 37:47.151
Master Bruce?

37:49.187 --> 37:50.754
She was lying.

37:50.789 --> 37:54.091
Oh...

37:54.125 --> 37:55.959
I see.

37:57.962 --> 37:59.730
Shall I get a broom, then?

37:59.764 --> 38:01.899
Or would you rather continue crying

38:01.933 --> 38:05.703
over the shattered fragments of your...

38:05.737 --> 38:07.705
young dreams?

38:14.579 --> 38:16.547
Yes, Alfred.

38:16.581 --> 38:18.248
A broom.

38:18.283 --> 38:20.250
Very good, Master Bruce.

38:27.158 --> 38:29.293
I'll find other leads.

38:29.327 --> 38:30.894
No doubt.

38:36.167 --> 38:39.370
I knew she was a wrong 'un.

38:44.242 --> 38:46.744
Arnold Flass.

38:48.913 --> 38:51.649
You're under arrest for
the murder of Leon Winkler.

38:51.683 --> 38:54.284
Keep walking, mutt. You got nothing.

38:54.319 --> 38:55.753
(quiet chatter, laughter)

38:58.690 --> 39:00.691
(chatter stops)

39:01.826 --> 39:04.995
That's 20 years upstate right there.

39:05.030 --> 39:07.298
Delaware gave you up.

39:07.332 --> 39:08.966
Jimbo...

39:09.000 --> 39:12.436
you really think these guys
are gonna let you arrest me?

39:12.470 --> 39:14.438
Hmm?

39:14.472 --> 39:15.839
<i>These are my friends.</i>

39:15.874 --> 39:17.408
<i>This is my house.</i>

39:17.442 --> 39:18.909
This is not your house.

39:18.944 --> 39:21.645
You're a drug dealer and a murderer.

39:21.680 --> 39:22.980
You don't belong here.

39:23.014 --> 39:24.515
You don't deserve the badge.

39:24.549 --> 39:26.083
(chuckles)

39:26.117 --> 39:27.518
You believe this crap?

39:27.552 --> 39:29.320
How long you been here?

39:29.354 --> 39:31.288
A few months?

39:31.323 --> 39:32.923
Why don't you come preach to me

39:32.958 --> 39:34.224
in five years?

39:40.665 --> 39:42.533
He murdered Leon Winkler,

39:42.567 --> 39:46.303
an innocent man who trusted us!

39:47.806 --> 39:49.640
Who trusted this.

39:49.674 --> 39:51.342
(officers murmuring)

39:54.312 --> 39:57.614
Enough to step forward
and help us solve a case.

39:59.050 --> 40:00.818
A man who died so Detective Flass

40:00.852 --> 40:02.853
could protect himself.

40:02.887 --> 40:05.456
I.A. ruled it a suicide.

40:08.093 --> 40:09.393
I'm arresting this man.

40:09.427 --> 40:11.795
Get real, dumb-ass. I'm protected.

40:11.830 --> 40:13.397
GORDON: You can help me
or you can try and stop me.

40:13.431 --> 40:14.865
Either way,

40:14.899 --> 40:16.433
I'm doing my duty.

40:16.468 --> 40:17.835
Hey, back off, all right?!

40:17.869 --> 40:19.236
I'm protected! Get out of here.

40:19.271 --> 40:20.504
Shut up, Flass.

40:26.011 --> 40:29.546
Arnold Flass, you're
under arrest for murder.

40:34.352 --> 40:36.720
The hell do you think
you're doing? Are you crazy?

40:36.755 --> 40:38.455
Read him his rights. (handcuffs clicking)

40:38.490 --> 40:40.391
You have the right to remain silent.

40:40.425 --> 40:42.092
Anything you say can and
will be used against you...

40:42.127 --> 40:44.028
You can't keep me in here!

40:44.062 --> 40:46.196
You know how many people I got?

40:46.231 --> 40:48.265
(Flass continues shouting)

40:51.636 --> 40:53.537
Thanks, Cap.

41:03.648 --> 41:05.149
(ship horn blowing in distance)

41:18.630 --> 41:20.631
Here.

41:21.733 --> 41:23.467
(shivers)

41:23.501 --> 41:26.203
So what's the plan?

41:26.237 --> 41:29.873
I'm gonna leave town, lay low for a while.

41:29.908 --> 41:33.577
Then I'm gonna come back and kill Penguin

41:33.611 --> 41:34.945
when the time is right.

41:34.980 --> 41:36.413
Listen,

41:36.448 --> 41:40.250
you know I have your
best interests at heart.

41:40.285 --> 41:42.386
Don't come back. No.

41:42.420 --> 41:45.155
You will see me again.

41:45.190 --> 41:48.158
And in the meantime, do me a favor.

41:48.193 --> 41:50.194
Find Butch.

41:52.364 --> 41:54.264
And if he's alive, help him.

41:54.299 --> 41:56.834
I will.

41:58.837 --> 42:01.138
See you soon.

42:01.172 --> 42:03.340
Be good.

42:10.281 --> 42:13.217
Always.

42:19.391 --> 42:21.392
♪ ♪

42:37.375 --> 42:39.343
(bird caws)

42:40.312 --> 42:42.446
Good night.

42:42.480 --> 42:44.048
Night, Detective.

42:45.083 --> 42:47.217
Yo.

42:47.252 --> 42:49.153
That big guy visit you?

42:49.187 --> 42:51.155
Give you the package I sent?

42:51.189 --> 42:52.990
Yeah. Thanks. That was, uh...

42:53.024 --> 42:54.992
Yo, this... so this means we're even?

42:55.026 --> 42:56.994
I ratted out Flass like you wanted.

42:57.028 --> 42:58.829
So now you back off, right?

42:58.863 --> 43:00.831
Nothing more is gonna happen to my wife?

43:00.865 --> 43:02.533
She's safe? My family's safe?

43:02.567 --> 43:04.201
I don't understand what
you're talking about.

43:04.235 --> 43:06.470
Okay, okay, no worries.

43:06.504 --> 43:07.538
Look,

43:07.572 --> 43:09.173
never mind I pressed.

43:09.207 --> 43:11.241
I won't say nothing to no one.

43:11.276 --> 43:14.178
I'll-I'll pretend this
conversation never happened.

43:14.212 --> 43:16.080
Okay? Just...

43:16.114 --> 43:18.582
keep my wife and kids out of it.

43:18.617 --> 43:20.618
I'm-I'm begging you.

43:24.222 --> 43:25.756
(sniffles)

43:25.790 --> 43:27.891
Please.

43:27.926 --> 43:31.181
Please! Please!
