35:48.980 --> 35:52.316
<i>surviving by joining together.</i>

35:53.151 --> 35:57.155
<i>The swarm drives them and protects them.</i>

35:59.740 --> 36:01.742
<i>Not everyone can make it.</i>

36:05.746 --> 36:07.623
<i>But most of them do.</i>

36:14.797 --> 36:18.968
<i>Look at them go.</i>
<i>It's like they're tied together.</i>

36:19.218 --> 36:22.680
<i>You can, like...</i>
<i>You can feel the connection.</i>

36:27.393 --> 36:28.978
So it looks like, even from...

36:30.771 --> 36:33.900
What could be a quarter mile away,
that they know.

36:35.318 --> 36:40.823
Like these all the way back here,
can sense what's happening up here.

36:47.955 --> 36:53.753
<i>For almost 30 years,</i>
<i>I've had an image in my mind.</i>

36:58.090 --> 37:02.220
<i>The plains of Africa dense</i>
<i>with millions of wildebeest.</i>

37:03.262 --> 37:07.225
But in the end,
I saw something I wasn't expecting.

37:07.934 --> 37:10.686
It's not millions of animals at all.

37:12.939 --> 37:14.357
<i>It's just one.</i>

37:14.690 --> 37:16.984

37:25.326 --> 37:28.371
Like George said, shift your perspective,

37:30.414 --> 37:31.832
<i>switch your lens,</i>

37:33.251 --> 37:37.213
<i>and you'll see the swarm everywhere.</i>

37:47.807 --> 37:52.311
<i>Makes you wonder,</i>
<i>do they even know they're in a swarm?</i>

37:54.063 --> 37:56.607
<i>Come to think of it, do we?</i>

38:00.069 --> 38:02.863
Damn. Now, that's a question.

<i>Next, I'm on the trail</i>

38:10.037 --> 38:11.122
MALE VOICE: <i>Shark!</i>

38:11.998 --> 38:14.041
-Whoa, there he is.
-Mm-hmm, you got one.

38:14.250 --> 38:16.043
WILL: Aw, yeah.

38:17.628 --> 38:21.465
<i>Following my nose to solve</i>
<i>a desert island mystery.</i>

38:21.716 --> 38:24.010
Whoa, that is gorgeous.

38:24.844 --> 38:29.181
<i>And discover that smell</i>
<i>is not what it seems.</i>
